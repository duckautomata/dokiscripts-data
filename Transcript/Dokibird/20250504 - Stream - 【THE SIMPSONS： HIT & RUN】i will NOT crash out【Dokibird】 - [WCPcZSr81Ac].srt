1
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:47,810
Hello, everybody.

2
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,090
Hello, hello.

3
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:50,710
Okay, guys.

4
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:54,990
If I do sound low energy, it's because a lot of stuff has been going on.

5
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:58,450
I didn't get to have my nap time in the end.

6
00:01:58,770 --> 00:01:59,910
I'm very sad.

7
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,310
I had no nap time.

8
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:03,870
I had, like, work stuff to do.

9
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:08,870
And I am still sick, as you can tell.

10
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:12,930
I am... I do sound sick because...

11
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:14,470
I am still sick.

12
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:18,410
I took some meds just then.

13
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,150
And I'm getting better.

14
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,510
My nose is not as stuffy anymore.

15
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,910
It's just my throat right now.

16
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,870
You know, it doesn't sound like a dying whale.

17
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:35,230
But, like, that's usually what happens when I get sick.

18
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:38,510
I get hit the hardest in my throat.

19
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,530
So, I am starting to cough again.

20
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:42,410
Which sucks.

21
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:45,310
Because I hope I don't cough for a month plus.

22
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,590
This won't be a super long stream today.

23
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:53,410
Since I do have Tokyo Alley in Australia to do.

24
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:56,350
I have a convention in Australia for Tokyo Alley.

25
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,670
And Perth.

26
00:02:58,830 --> 00:02:59,890
Which would be a meet and greet.

27
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,370
And a panel later tonight.

28
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:05,770
So, obviously, uh... I can't stay for too long.

29
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,770
So, I can still have a voice for it.

30
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,030
The other two things.

31
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,430
Just so you guys know.

32
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:14,390
I scheduled all of this before I got sick.

33
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,250
And now that I got sick.

34
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,250
I now have to be aware of all these other things.

35
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:21,950
I don't know how.

36
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,290
This always happens.

37
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,210
I would, like, schedule some things.

38
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,730
And then I would be like, everything will be fine.

39
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:29,970
Obviously, everything was not fine.

40
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,970
Because other stuff started happening.

41
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:37,270
So, this always happens.

42
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,370
I'd be like, I can't wait.

43
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:41,930
I'm looking forward to this week.

44
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,810
And then something happens.

45
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,930
And I was like, oh...

46
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:50,350
Guess... Guess this week is gonna be hard.

47
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:56,030
Another thing is that...

48
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,010
Okay.

49
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:01,630
So, I won't be doing these Doki Amber Doge updates.

50
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:03,910
On...

51
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,570
On Twitter.

52
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:05,870
Uh, for a while.

53
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:08,750
Because, like, it's all sort of up in the air.

54
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,630
I don't wanna make you guys feel too sad.

55
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,070
I don't wanna make you guys feel down.

56
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,690
It's also why I'm, like, really tired and exhausted.

57
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,410
Obviously, there's a lot of stuff going on at the moment.

58
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:19,970
So, like, I'm not taking care of myself very well.

59
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:20,710
Because of it.

60
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:21,550
And I do live alone.

61
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,050
Um, so...

62
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,490
Uh, regarding, like...

63
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:26,870
I got an abrupt date today.

64
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,090
And a lot of you guys are curious about it.

65
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,650
And, like, want to know how he's doing.

66
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:31,650
And everything.

67
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:33,350
Um...

68
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:34,910
I'm trying not to sound sad.

69
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,050
But I am exhausted.

70
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:38,430
Um...

71
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,790
And I'm gonna use this stream to help, you know...

72
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:43,910
Help me keep my mind off things and everything.

73
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,290
And I hope it helps keep your mind off things.

74
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:47,210
And everything.

75
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,630
But I will be visiting him tonight.

76
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,410
At the hospital.

77
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:54,050
Um, after this stream.

78
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,590
Uh, just to see him.

79
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,750
And, you know, uh...

80
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,990
I heard that visiting hours end at 9.

81
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:01,170
So, I'm gonna be visiting him tonight.

82
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,390
After this stream.

83
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,550
And, uh...

84
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,850
Uh, because he is gonna be staying another night.

85
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,250
At the hospital.

86
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:11,010
Um, we could've discharged him today.

87
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,570
But I decided to...

88
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:16,230
I know it's gonna, you know, obviously cost more money.

89
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,810
I'm gonna get pet insurance after this.

90
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:22,470
Because he might need long-term, uh...

91
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:23,950
Medication in the future.

92
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,830
Which is why, like, I'm a little down because of it.

93
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:30,650
Uh, so I will be getting pet insurance after this.

94
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:32,450
And, uh...

95
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:33,490
After, like, the entire...

96
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:35,290
After the entire incident of this is over.

97
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:36,970
I will be getting pet insurance.

98
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:41,290
Uh, because there is a possibility that I will have to get prescribed medication for him.

99
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,330
Long-term wise.

100
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,990
Um, but basically...

101
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:48,170
Um, it was my choice to keep him there an extra night.

102
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:51,450
Because of the new medication he's gonna be on.

103
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:52,310
Starting today.

104
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:55,070
Um, and I got really worried.

105
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,610
Because they're telling me...

106
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,850
Some of the things that might happen.

107
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,070
And I got really fucking worried.

108
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:02,570
I won't tell you guys.

109
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:03,530
But...

110
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,570
I was like...

111
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:07,710
I'll rather prefer he stays in the hospital...

112
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:08,930
For one more night.

113
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,750
Because I wanna be sure...

114
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,530
That nothing new comes up.

115
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:13,850
Because of it.

116
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,090
Um...

117
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:15,850
Um...

118
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:17,130
So...

119
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:17,850
Uh...

120
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:18,490
So they're like...

121
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:19,410
Yeah, that's understandable.

122
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,890
Because he could have been discharged today.

123
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,450
But I was so scared...

124
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,170
That, like, something was gonna happen.

125
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,370
So now I was like...

126
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:26,190
It's safer.

127
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:30,410
And easier to have him there instead.

128
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:31,550
Um...

129
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:32,370
So basically...

130
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:33,930
The old medications...

131
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:36,510
Might have given him some side effects...

132
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,430
That was really harsh on his kidneys.

133
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,310
And because of that...

134
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,570
He's being taken off...

135
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,190
On his old medication.

136
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,150
And being given...

137
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,610
Two new medications...

138
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:47,810
That he's taking right today...

139
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:48,710
Starting today.

140
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:49,670
Um...

141
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:50,290
That will be...

142
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,110
Or starting yesterday.

143
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,410
I think it was started yesterday.

144
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:53,330
That night.

145
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,030
That would be easier on him.

146
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,050
Um...

147
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:56,570
He's stable.

148
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:57,390
He's eating.

149
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:58,190
He's drinking.

150
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:00,230
Um...

151
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,790
He is not...

152
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:02,390
Uh...

153
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,490
He's not...

154
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,210
Uh...

155
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:06,590
He did vomit last night.

156
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:07,930
But only a little bit.

157
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,710
And he had a little...

158
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:10,270
Oh wait...

159
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,670
Yeah, he had a little diarrhea.

160
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:12,910
So like...

161
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,190
He is getting better.

162
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:15,570
So what...

163
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:17,070
Yesterday I was talking about...

164
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,810
During yesterday's stream...

165
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:19,810
Um...

166
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:20,690
Was that...

167
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,770
He's peeing out his protein.

168
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:24,910
And we don't know why.

169
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,290
And we think it's a side effect...

170
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,090
From the medication...

171
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,270
He was taking...

172
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,510
For his surgery.

173
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:33,610
Because it was really hard...

174
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:34,860
That specific medication...

175
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:36,980
Is very harsh...

176
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:38,210
On the kidneys.

177
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,230
And because of that...

178
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,490
It might have triggered something...

179
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:42,010
That may...

180
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:42,870
Is making him...

181
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:43,790
Pee out his protein.

182
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:45,490
So...

183
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:45,950
His...

184
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,170
We're giving him...

185
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:48,110
A new medication...

186
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,250
That's gonna help...

187
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:51,230
Fix his protein levels.

188
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:52,730
Because...

189
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:53,090
Um...

190
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:54,130
It's not really good...

191
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,470
That he's peeing out...

192
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:56,410
Like his protein.

193
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:57,630
Um...

194
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:58,190
So like...

195
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,310
His protein is like...

196
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,570
Really low right now.

197
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,430
So we're giving him medication...

198
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,570
To help with that.

199
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:04,950
And...

200
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:05,230
Uh...

201
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:06,690
Um...

202
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:07,870
Um...

203
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:09,590
And so...

204
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:10,230
Uh...

205
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,150
So this medication should help.

206
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:12,750
But...

207
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,770
In a couple of weeks...

208
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:15,410
I have to come back...

209
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:16,710
And check up on him...

210
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:17,830
Like for internal...

211
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,450
To see if the medication is helping.

212
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:20,790
And if...

213
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:21,730
Internally...

214
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:22,590
If he's okay.

215
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:23,570
Because like...

216
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:24,130
There's...

217
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:24,370
Like...

218
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,710
Kidney-wise...

219
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:26,150
Like...

220
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:26,690
We don't know...

221
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,550
What exactly is going on.

222
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:29,690
Um...

223
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:30,570
And...

224
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:31,750
Um...

225
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,090
I do have...

226
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:33,770
So like...

227
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:34,450
We're just...

228
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:35,910
Trying to figure that out.

229
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:37,070
But...

230
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,110
Uh...

231
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:38,630
Uh...

232
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,310
But we did look at the urine samples...

233
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:42,630
And that's basically what we meant by like...

234
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,090
Yeah...

235
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:43,250
His...

236
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:43,890
Yeah...

237
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:44,610
There's like...

238
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:45,070
He's...

239
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,430
His pee is weird.

240
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:47,870
Like...

241
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,830
Um...

242
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:49,710
So...

243
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:50,330
Uh...

244
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,930
We're picking him up tomorrow.

245
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,630
The dog sitter is picking him up...

246
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,470
Me and the dog sitter are picking him up tomorrow.

247
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:56,630
Um...

248
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:57,890
With his new sense of medication.

249
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,830
We're gonna be supervising him...

250
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,070
To make sure he doesn't have any...

251
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:01,430
Uh...

252
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,050
Side effects.

253
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:02,910
And like...

254
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,770
Effects from...

255
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:04,250
Like...

256
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,510
If he has like...

257
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:06,370
Too low protein...

258
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:06,930
There are...

259
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:07,730
Effects...

260
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:08,910
That would...

261
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:09,750
Show up...

262
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,850
On his body.

263
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:11,990
And stuff like that.

264
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:12,690
And his behavior.

265
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:13,830
So...

266
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:14,970
Tomorrow is when like...

267
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:15,990
It's like hard supervision.

268
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,110
And I'm really happy that...

269
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:18,610
Um...

270
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:19,870
The dog sitter...

271
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:20,790
It will...

272
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:21,610
Is aware...

273
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:22,270
Is aware of it.

274
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:25,030
And will be supervising him for me.

275
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:26,730
And help making sure that...

276
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:27,150
You know...

277
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,010
Everything will be okay.

278
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:29,530
And...

279
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:30,530
Um...

280
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:31,150
And...

281
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:31,650
Um...

282
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:31,850
You know...

283
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:32,930
The dog sitter got really worried.

284
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,290
They're like...

285
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:34,170
We can pick him up earlier.

286
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,570
So he doesn't have to stay in the hospital...

287
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:36,250
Like the whole day.

288
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:36,730
And everything.

289
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:37,570
And I really...

290
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:38,950
Appreciate that.

291
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:39,870
Because like...

292
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,770
Obviously like...

293
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:43,430
They really love dad as well.

294
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:44,630
And like...

295
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,470
And were like...

296
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:46,010
Really concerned.

297
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:47,690
Was asking me updates every day.

298
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:48,190
Uh...

299
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:48,730
Via text.

300
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:50,990
And they said they could even pick him up earlier.

301
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:52,290
If needed be.

302
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:53,610
Uh...

303
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:54,630
To like...

304
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,250
Uh...

305
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:55,670
You know...

306
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:56,710
Make sure he's more like...

307
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:56,950
You know...

308
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:57,730
Being with like...

309
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:58,270
You know...

310
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:58,890
Family and stuff.

311
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,310
And being with people he knows.

312
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:02,070
Instead of being stuck in the hospital.

313
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:02,810
But...

314
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,730
I did make the decision to...

315
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,410
Put him in there for an extra day.

316
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:07,490
Um...

317
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:08,370
Just because...

318
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:10,150
Uh...

319
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,890
Just because I got really...

320
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:13,110
Worried and scared.

321
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,450
Because like...

322
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,050
You know...

323
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,810
Whenever you hear stuff from the...

324
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,150
What the vet was telling me.

325
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,590
I got really scared.

326
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:20,930
And I was just like...

327
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:21,470
God...

328
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:24,230
You guys can keep it for an extra day.

329
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:24,850
Like...

330
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:25,630
I...

331
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,690
I don't want...

332
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:27,890
I don't know if like...

333
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,110
Something's gonna happen.

334
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:30,870
Yeah.

335
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:32,590
Um...

336
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:32,770
Yeah.

337
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:34,830
So especially if he's on new medication.

338
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:36,810
And things like...

339
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:38,290
Um...

340
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:39,950
And like...

341
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:40,590
Uh...

342
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:40,790
Yeah.

343
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,130
And then you know how like...

344
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:43,150
The doctor...

345
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,770
When the vet's talking to you.

346
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:45,690
And they're like...

347
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:46,650
It could be this.

348
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:47,450
It could be that.

349
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,670
It could be this disease.

350
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,710
And I was like...

351
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:50,970
I was like...

352
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:51,830
What?

353
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:52,170
Like...

354
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,330
I was just like...

355
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,790
He came here for a...

356
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,370
Broken spine.

357
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:01,090
And now he has a million things going on?

358
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,470
I was like...

359
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,030
I was like...

360
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,590
What's wrong with you?

361
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:06,750
Like...

362
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,250
I was like...

363
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,030
I thought it was just the spine.

364
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:14,910
How did all of this came to be?

365
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,170
Like...

366
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:18,310
So...

367
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,670
Uh...

368
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,030
Yeah.

369
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:21,150
Uh...

370
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,830
Peek wiener dog experience.

371
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,030
Mother...

372
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,530
I am a monster.

373
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:28,310
I was like...

374
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:29,350
Why did...

375
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,370
You had all...

376
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:33,230
So many underlying stuff...

377
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,630
That happened.

378
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,090
I...

379
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:38,790
I thought I just had to worry about...

380
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,130
The spine.

381
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:41,950
And then like...

382
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,010
Aftercare.

383
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:44,110
And...

384
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,190
Now...

385
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,510
I have like...

386
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:51,090
A million other things now I'm worrying about.

387
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:53,510
And the possibility of...

388
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,430
Well, there is...

389
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:56,830
He is going to be on long-term medication...

390
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,770
Regarding the kidney now.

391
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:00,270
So...

392
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,210
Uh...

393
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:02,590
So there's that.

394
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:03,110
Because I was like...

395
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,730
How are you peeing out protein?

396
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,550
They were like...

397
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,910
Has he ever had...

398
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:08,170
Like...

399
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:08,970
Did he ever like...

400
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:09,710
Peed a lot?

401
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:10,450
Or like...

402
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:11,810
Had issues with like...

403
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,010
Vomiting and diarrhea?

404
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:14,550
I was like...

405
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,310
No...

406
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,970
Then they're like...

407
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:17,570
Yeah...

408
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,370
So...

409
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:21,510
This could be the side effects from the earlier...

410
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,470
Meds...

411
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,550
That he took...

412
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,630
That could have triggered...

413
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:25,970
Um...

414
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:26,270
That...

415
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,450
This was an underlying thing that he had...

416
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,630
But the medication...

417
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:30,450
Finally...

418
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:30,630
Like...

419
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:31,770
It was a dormant thing...

420
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,470
That he had...

421
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,730
And then the...

422
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:36,490
The meds...

423
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,210
Could have had...

424
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:38,090
The side effect was...

425
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,410
It triggered this dormant thing that he had...

426
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:41,730
And now he started...

427
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:43,430
Peeing out his protein...

428
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,310
So I was like...

429
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:45,070
Excuse me?

430
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,270
He was like...

431
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,250
Dad!

432
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,510
What the fuck?

433
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:53,540
Um...

434
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,240
Yeah...

435
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,000
Because they're like...

436
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,820
Did he try...

437
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,780
Did he pee a lot?

438
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,820
And I was like...

439
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,560
No, he peed...

440
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,060
Normal amount...

441
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:00,400
Like...

442
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,340
I was like...

443
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:01,780
No!

444
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,480
He...

445
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,280
He had a normal experience...

446
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,000
Uh...

447
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,040
Yeah...

448
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:08,780
Uh...

449
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:11,480
Uh...

450
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,280
Yeah...

451
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,040
So...

452
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,880
So...

453
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,280
Uh...

454
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:15,980
Uh...

455
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:16,740
So...

456
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,240
No, they didn't screw up his meds...

457
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,180
Because it's the usual medication...

458
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,160
That they give...

459
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:21,760
Because like...

460
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,340
This is like...

461
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,280
It was like a...

462
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:23,760
It's...

463
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,300
You know...

464
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:24,620
Like...

465
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,480
It's typical wiener dog...

466
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,320
Experience...

467
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:28,940
Uh...

468
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:29,540
So...

469
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,260
It's not like...

470
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,240
They screw up the meds...

471
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,020
Because every...

472
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:32,760
This is like...

473
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,440
A typical wiener dog...

474
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:34,740
Thing...

475
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,360
That...

476
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:36,660
Happens...

477
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,200
Uh...

478
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,400
For wiener dogs...

479
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,020
And like...

480
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:39,680
This is like...

481
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,380
The usual thing...

482
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,640
They either prescribe...

483
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,220
To...

484
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,220
Um...

485
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,400
To dogs...

486
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,160
To dogs...

487
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,640
Who have gone through...

488
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,260
Uh...

489
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:47,600
Like...

490
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,160
The spine surgery...

491
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,140
And...

492
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:50,860
Um...

493
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:51,460
And...

494
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,580
Obviously like...

495
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:52,800
It...

496
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,420
The one...

497
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,420
The side facts was that...

498
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,980
It could be really harsh on the kidneys...

499
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,820
And that was what's going on for him right now...

500
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,240
Like his...

501
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,080
It like...

502
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:00,620
Like...

503
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,940
His kidneys was not adjusting very well...

504
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:03,740
With...

505
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,180
Uh...

506
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,280
With the new medication...

507
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,540
With the medication he was on...

508
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,540
So now he's on new sets of medication...

509
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,840
To help him with...

510
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,220
Uh...

511
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:10,720
Because like...

512
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,240
After he was on that medication...

513
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,700
He was having...

514
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:14,820
Diarrhea...

515
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,180
And he was vomiting...

516
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,020
So like...

517
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:17,400
Um...

518
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:21,980
Obviously after that we went back and then they're like, yeah, we're gonna give him these two new medications.

519
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,020
Because I asked him like, that's a lot of medication.

520
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,200
And they were like, okay, they're like, yes, but we are taking him off with the other two that he was on.

521
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:37,480
Because he was on four different types of medication after the surgery, which was typical to prescribe after back surgery.

522
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:48,600
Um, and usually the surgery is, um, usually the surgery is for, for wiener dogs, for dachshunds.

523
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:55,620
Uh, like most of the surgery, like, cause like, majority of surgery this happens to is for dachshunds.

524
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,160
Because they like to fucking jump and they're not supposed to jump.

525
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,260
And that's why they break their backs.

526
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:06,420
Um, well they didn't break their back, it's like a disc, like a disc thing.

527
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,540
I don't remember the full name, but it's like a disc thing.

528
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,620
And that's like the normal surgery for wiener dogs.

529
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:17,720
And, um, and, uh, so he was on four different types of medication.

530
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,940
So we're taking him off on two of them.

531
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:20,780
Yeah, the disc clip.

532
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:21,080
Yeah.

533
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:24,820
So he had a slipped disc and we had to like cut the disc and stuff like that.

534
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:32,020
And so, um, we're putting him on, we're, we took off two of the medication that he was on.

535
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:38,180
And, uh, putting him on two new ones to like replace the ones that were as harsh on his kidneys.

536
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:42,240
And, uh, so that's like the current update on him.

537
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,720
And I do have ramps.

538
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,020
I bought a new set of ramps.

539
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:49,580
The thing is, um, he, I did have ramps, but he likes to jump down.

540
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,240
Uh, he likes to jump down from my bed and he refused to use the ramps.

541
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:59,800
And now that, so then like, um, so I'm gonna, I bought like a new set of ramps that will be in the front.

542
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,620
Cause I had one ramp that was just for my bed for him to go up.

543
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,560
And then he like, he like gets impatient.

544
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,400
He jumps down.

545
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:11,960
So I bought another set of ramps for him to get down from the front of my bed.

546
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:17,460
Cause he, cause I put the stairs, the ramp stairs at the back of my bed, at the side of my bed, at the back.

547
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:26,400
Um, so he gets lazy and now, so then if I put two on there, one in the front, and then he sees the front ramps, then he'll go down on the ramps from the front.

548
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,000
So that's like how I'm gonna see it, but obviously he needs to recover.

549
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:35,980
He's walking, but he's, okay, so like, this is the most fucked up thing for me.

550
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,900
Cause like, he's getting better with walking.

551
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:44,820
Like he's improving on his walking, but now it's his kidneys.

552
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:50,260
So I'm like, you can, like, he's actually, he's getting better.

553
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:56,560
Like he would wobble a little bit after his surgery, but now he's like walking normally again.

554
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,580
But now it's his kidneys.

555
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,880
So I'm like, what's wrong with you?

556
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,140
Yeah.

557
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:08,820
Um, um, um, yeah.

558
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,220
I mean, the surgery was for walking.

559
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:15,660
So, um, um, or um, yeah.

560
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,660
So he's just a little box.

561
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:18,460
He's like, surprise!

562
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:21,320
Surprise!

563
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,920
There's another thing!

564
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,540
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

565
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,840
Yeah, his mutant genes have activated.

566
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,220
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, yeah.

567
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,780
So, um, he had, he wasn't able to walk before.

568
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:45,120
But obviously he was like... he was like stumbling because obviously he just had back surgery.

569
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,340
So he was like stumbling and stuff like that wobbly.

570
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,200
But now it's better now.

571
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:57,800
And then... but then obviously the newest thing is now to figure out his kidney issue.

572
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:07,760
So I don't know but I still... they did tell me on Monday... like yesterday they told me on Monday we're getting... we might have to do an ultra scan to make sure there's nothing...

573
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,680
else related.

574
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,680
Nothing else other than related to it.

575
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:17,920
So I'm not sure yet if Monday is still a thing.

576
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,760
Because they did tell me... because today is a different vet.

577
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:24,600
Because the other vet that usually takes care of his dad.

578
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,660
Doesn't show up on the weekends.

579
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,580
So this vet was like telling me how like...

580
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:37,000
Yeah, our newest plan is blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

581
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:52,820
And then I was like, okay, so he's going to be on meds for a couple of weeks, and then for the kidney, and then we're going to check back into the hospital to see if it has any improvement or anything.

582
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,720
So, yep, all right.

583
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,500
But that is the current update with Dad.

584
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:07,580
So, I hope everything will be okay by tomorrow.

585
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:12,700
And then tomorrow, he'll be heading back home.

586
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:13,900
Well, not home.

587
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,920
He'll be heading to the dog sitter for them to supervise him.

588
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:24,560
I wish he could come home, but obviously with my schedule, I'm really worried.

589
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,280
I cannot supervise him 24-7.

590
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:35,740
I would wish I could, but obviously I live alone, and I do have a lot of work obligations and everything.

591
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:49,920
So, obviously, I cannot look after him 24-7 to make sure he doesn't have any negative side effects or symptoms that might show up with the current issues that he's having.

592
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,160
So, yeah.

593
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:57,780
I really appreciate everybody for all the support for him.

594
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:06,540
And, like, we've had good news that he's stable, that he's eating, that he's drinking, and everything.

595
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,580
That everybody's like, yeah, he has, like, he's perked up.

596
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,780
He has energy and everything.

597
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,740
So, like, that makes me really happy.

598
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:20,820
I'm gonna ask the hospital, like, what kind of food to recommend him during his hospital stay.

599
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:25,520
So, maybe, like, maybe, like, we'll just feed him whatever he was being fed at the hospital.

600
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:29,940
Because I felt like whatever he's been eating at the hospital has been going okay for him.

601
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,680
So, like, I'll just go with that.

602
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,840
Yeah, so there's more positive news than negative news.

603
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,840
Obviously, I am.

604
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,580
There's, like, an underlying fear for me.

605
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:48,260
But, like, as a concerned pet owner, you know, that's, like, that's something that, you know, the thought that's, like, for everybody.

606
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,640
But thank you, everybody, for support.

607
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,940
Thank you all for the super chat.

608
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,600
It has been very expensive.

609
00:20:53,600 --> 00:21:00,360
So, I really do appreciate all the support going throughout all of it.

610
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,780
And, obviously, I'm not taking care of myself, too.

611
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,600
I have been absolutely not taking care of myself throughout all of this.

612
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:19,380
So, yeah, because, like, my manager was, like, yeah, like, I understand.

613
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:24,040
And, like, you gotta eat healthier and, like, you know, I'm not...

614
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,580
I gotta go outside a bit more, too.

615
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,740
Like, after I recover from me sick, obviously.

616
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,280
And, obviously, I can't really go outside.

617
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,340
Like, usually, Dad helps me with going outside more.

618
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:44,540
And, obviously, since he's been, you know, going in and out of the hospital and being at the dog sitter, I haven't been going out as much anymore, if any.

619
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,720
Because I don't have to walk him and touch grass.

620
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,640
So, that was sort of, like, an issue, obviously.

621
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:55,360
So, like, it's just taking things one at a time.

622
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,500
Like, my first priority is making sure Dad is okay.

623
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:03,700
And that there's no other, like, you know, there's nothing else to worry about after that.

624
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:10,800
But, again, like I said, I really appreciate everybody for the support and for the well wishes and for being here.

625
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,320
It really helps.

626
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,480
Talking about this helps a lot for me, too.

627
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,940
I hope it doesn't make you guys too sad.

628
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,160
Like, there's more positive news than there is sad news.

629
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,480
And, like, he is stable.

630
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,040
He is stable.

631
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,700
He is...

632
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,080
Health-wise, it seems like he's okay.

633
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:34,820
It's just that we are looking, making sure that he will be okay after the hospital.

634
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,940
Like, after the discharge.

635
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:40,160
And there's no, like, you know, there's no other...

636
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,520
Nothing else happening afterwards.

637
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:50,120
And it's just going to, you know, just going back to the checkup and just making sure he's okay and everything.

638
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,800
But I hope it doesn't make you guys too sad or anything.

639
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:57,440
But, like, update-wise, he is doing okay.

640
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,260
He is stable.

641
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,300
I'll be visiting him.

642
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:03,500
I'll be visiting him today after this stream.

643
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,000
This might not be a very long stream either.

644
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,940
So, just because I do have two other things to do tonight.

645
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:13,500
We're writing my panel in Australia and my meet and greets.

646
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,020
But thank you guys for so much support.

647
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:19,080
I bet Dad misses you guys too.

648
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,240
And I know Dad misses us a lot.

649
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,200
And I miss him too.

650
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,440
And I know you guys miss him as well.

651
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:27,820
I know you guys miss hearing him fucking demanding me for food.

652
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,520
That's for sure.

653
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,400
Zekra, thank you for the super chat.

654
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,200
Thank you, thank you.

655
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,160
Parents for Dad, please take care of both of you.

656
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:38,940
Thank you for the super chat.

657
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:39,720
Thank you, thank you.

658
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,160
Johnny Lacombe, thank you for the super chat.

659
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,080
Thank you, thank you.

660
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,140
Chat stream, welcome to Tomato Farm.

661
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,040
Welcome, welcome.

662
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:00,120
Yes, you guys miss him being his goddamn fucking bratty self.

663
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,280
Another life update.

664
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:04,920
Tomorrow, I'll be streaming the early access of Apex Legends.

665
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,280
If you guys didn't know, I already tweeted about that.

666
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,940
I tweeted about it today, actually.

667
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:13,840
Just then.

668
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:22,080
But, yes, I will be doing the early access, I believe.

669
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,460
Okay, here's the image.

670
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,060
I'll just push the image out.

671
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,920
Okay, there you go.

672
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:34,280
So, I have the early access for the newest season.

673
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,380
Which is the release of their newest hero and all the other changes.

674
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,340
I did play Apex yesterday.

675
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,160
Just because I was, like, curious.

676
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:45,760
Like, you know, just because last time I touched Apex was March.

677
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:50,940
So, I played Apex yesterday to, like, you know, brush up on everything.

678
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:56,780
And, like, you know, just to, like, remember how to play the game.

679
00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:00,040
And now I realize why everybody was complaining about the P20.

680
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:05,660
Like, yeah, like, I mean, I'm still good with the bow check.

681
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:11,640
But now I know why everyone was hard complaining about the P20.

682
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,400
The dual P20s.

683
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,220
And, yeah.

684
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,800
Like, no, like, that...

685
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,080
Yeah, it's fun to play use.

686
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:18,660
It's...

687
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,460
It's fun to use.

688
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,780
But, like...

689
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,220
It's not fun to die to it either.

690
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,880
And everybody is there.

691
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,740
It's always just P20s.

692
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,620
It's P20s everywhere.

693
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:33,540
Um...

694
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,300
Um...

695
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:35,560
Um...

696
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:36,600
Yeah.

697
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:37,160
Uh...

698
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,660
It's not fun to die to it.

699
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,700
But it is very fun.

700
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,960
I don't know which character is meta.

701
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:42,940
But it doesn't matter.

702
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,760
I'll be playing a new character anyway when I can.

703
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,940
I was trying out with different characters.

704
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:52,600
Just to figure out, like, what is fun to play on at the moment.

705
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,360
For, like...

706
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,560
Like, solos and stuff.

707
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,500
For tomorrow.

708
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,060
So, um...

709
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:00,680
When...

710
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,400
Um...

711
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,060
Um...

712
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:03,600
I'm not sure.

713
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:04,720
I'm not sure yet.

714
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,400
Um...

715
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:06,920
What...

716
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,420
Um...

717
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,620
If I can't get the new...

718
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,240
What's his name?

719
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,320
I don't even know.

720
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:10,980
Alter...

721
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:11,260
I...

722
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:11,620
Okay.

723
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,920
I think Alter...

724
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,480
Is...

725
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,940
I tried using Alter...

726
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,360
And I was doing, like...

727
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,920
Team plays and stuff.

728
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,080
That was good for my team.

729
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,940
But, like...

730
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:21,640
I...

731
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,040
She's so...

732
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,980
I don't like playing her...

733
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:25,740
To frag.

734
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,840
It's so hard to, like...

735
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,960
I feel like...

736
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,600
It's difficult to frag with her.

737
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,040
Because she's such a...

738
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,860
She's just a character for...

739
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:35,160
As...

740
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:35,860
For your team.

741
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,520
Not for yourself.

742
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:38,560
And...

743
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:38,960
Because I...

744
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,240
I...

745
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,440
I tried her out.

746
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,340
And I did more damage...

747
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,280
On every other character...

748
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,520
But Alter...

749
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:45,980
Like...

750
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:46,740
I did, like...

751
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,100
I...

752
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,880
I had her for one game...

753
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,500
And then, like...

754
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,440
I did 500 damage...

755
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,160
But we won the game...

756
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,420
Because I had, like...

757
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:54,840
Like...

758
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,220
Game-changing alts...

759
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:56,860
That, like...

760
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,040
Helped my team...

761
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,160
And I played every other character...

762
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,780
And then all the other characters...

763
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:02,420
I had, like...

764
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,960
2k plus damage...

765
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,860
And I was like...

766
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:05,640
Yeah, like...

767
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,620
So, like, I was like, this is not fun.

768
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,200
Like, 2k plus, I was playing, yeah, I was doing rank.

769
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,940
I was playing bronze rank.

770
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:23,220
And then, like, all the other characters, because I played, like, I think I played, like, four to five games.

771
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,340
And then all the other characters, yeah, helping the team?

772
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,360
Boring.

773
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,360
Boring.

774
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,180
Like, screw helping my fucking team.

775
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:39,640
And then every other character I played, I had 2k plus damage.

776
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:49,920
So, it was like, I was like, I just felt like, I know I did one game for Altered, but I was just like, it just did not feel like, um, it wants to support my teammates.

777
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:50,720
Exactly.

778
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,660
I'm here to frag.

779
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,800
I'll use someone else's Altered.

780
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,560
Yeah, but Apex is not about being a healer.

781
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,640
Apex is, like, more fun.

782
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,140
Apex is more fun when you can shoot your gun.

783
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,320
Like, it's different from Marvel Rivals.

784
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:14,500
Um, and I'm more used to, like, I'm more used to... Okay, it was one character, Gus.

785
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,320
Oh, ignore the other characters I got 2k plus damage on.

786
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,320
Like, like...

787
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:26,960
I'm here to explain why I didn't like Altered.

788
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:35,260
I even... I... Okay, and then we had... Okay, actually, we had a Smurf.

789
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:38,300
Um, I had a Smurf with me.

790
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,320
And then, like...

791
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,680
And, cause, like, they were, like, a level 27, gold 2.

792
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:49,020
Well, I was, you know, Bronze 2 or something, cause I ranked up to Bronze 2 at that point.

793
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:52,500
Like, it took me, like, 4... 4 games to... Almost...

794
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:57,620
It took me, like, 3 games to get a Bronze 2 from the lower Bronze.

795
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:02,740
And then, like, we had a level... Cause, like, level 20 is, like, um...

796
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,760
You can play rank, right?

797
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,700
So, level 27... Sorry, I know we haven't done the Simpsons thing yet.

798
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,620
Look, this is my... This usually... This part is gonna be after the stream would be done.

799
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:14,060
But I'm doing it in the beginning, because, like...

800
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:17,480
Usually, I just go bye now after... After the stream is done.

801
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,520
Cause I used up all my voices.

802
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:21,220
It's the only time I can talk to you guys before I lose my voice.

803
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:24,500
Like, not crashing out in the Simpsons.

804
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,400
Um...

805
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,760
But, like...

806
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,800
We had a Smurf that was a level 27.

807
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:34,860
Um...

808
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,060
And, uh...

809
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:37,920
And...

810
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,500
And she was on Alter.

811
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:43,720
And then, I was on Conduit.

812
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,040
I was on Conduit.

813
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,460
Cause I was playing different characters every game.

814
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,900
Just to get a feel.

815
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:51,740
Cause, like, you know, it's been a while since I played, uh...

816
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,100
Apex.

817
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:55,540
So, I was experimenting with every character.

818
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,440
I was experimenting with characters every game.

819
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,740
Just to be, like...

820
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,600
Just to get a feel of Apex again.

821
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,200
Cause it's been a while since I played Apex.

822
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,400
So, that game with the Smurf...

823
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:21,800
Uh, who was on Altair, uh, Gull 2, level 27, so I knew, like, this guy was not, like, on his main account, because a lot of, like, you know, obviously, like, looking at the rank and the levels, and, and I was on Kanyo, because I wanted to figure out, like,

824
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:28,160
just try to get a feel playing different characters, and seeing what is, what I feel good on, like, at that moment.

825
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:36,380
And even that guy, I thought he was doing really well, because he was doing, like, really sick plays on Altair, like, the portals, and, like, the alts, and everything.

826
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:52,820
And all that shit, and then I looked at, we won the game, like, like, we won, and I looked at the damage score line, the stat line, and I think I had, like, 1.8k damage, and then I was, like, yeah, okay, that makes sense.

827
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:57,940
And then, like, and then our altar had 600.

828
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,900
I was, like, what the fuck?

829
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,700
I was, like, wait, you did nothing?

830
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,080
I thought he did a lot.

831
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,680
I was, like, oh, man, my altar's pretty good.

832
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:19,100
Like, these are some really good alts, and some really good, like, like, portal placement, like, good util.

833
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,000
This util was really good.

834
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,380
I think my altar is doing so well.

835
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,460
Oh, man, look, oh, he killed some guy.

836
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,480
And then, like, I was, like, 1.9k.

837
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:34,740
All right, 1.9k.

838
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,360
I was in top fragger.

839
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:43,240
Our third got 2.3k or some shit, or, and then, and then Altair was, like, 600k.

840
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,440
And I was, like, wait a minute.

841
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,920
I was just, like, wait a minute.

842
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:51,460
What?

843
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:54,100
Oh, man, I thought that guy was a really good player, though.

844
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,920
But, um, but, yeah.

845
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:02,480
But, yeah, I just feel like Altair is definitely a, like, they know what they were doing.

846
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:06,520
Like, they know what they were clearly doing.

847
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:11,760
It was just, like, um, I just think Altair was just not a frag character.

848
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:19,240
It's literally support and, um, it's support and, like, um, and util.

849
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,800
And I don't know.

850
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,460
Maybe, maybe I'm wrong.

851
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:26,660
But from the games I was playing, that's how I felt when I played her.

852
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:30,080
And how I saw from the other guy that was playing her.

853
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,260
Because I thought I was doing well with util.

854
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:37,940
I just can't, I just can't frag with her for some fucking reason.

855
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:48,580
Um, uh, but, 600 damage, Altair, let's go!

856
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:55,000
That's like, you go, you go, Altair!

857
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:00,800
Um, uh, but, yeah, so, I was experimenting a little bit.

858
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:10,680
But on Sunday, I will be doing a, um, I will, on Sunday, I'll be doing my, uh, 9am, I'll be on at 9am tomorrow.

859
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:17,560
Um, for, because that's when the whole early access drops, so you guys can see the new character.

860
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,140
And on Twitch, I'll be doing a...

861
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:24,240
So, I will have a sponsor stream on Monday.

862
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,740
But, um, it's not fully confirmed yet.

863
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,760
Um, I haven't signed anything for it yet.

864
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:32,560
So, I'm still waiting on the details on that.

865
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,320
So, I can't confirm anything.

866
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:39,620
But, I am required to stream an out...

867
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,100
Like, this will be on Twitch on Monday.

868
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,800
So, on Monday, um, this will be on Monday.

869
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:50,380
Um, and, um, I am required to stream something...

870
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,500
And it'll be on Twitch, by the way.

871
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,620
The Monday stream will be on Twitch.

872
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,180
The Sunday stream is gonna be on YouTube.

873
00:33:54,520 --> 00:34:00,160
On Monday, for the sponsor, I have to be live an hour before the sponsor stream.

874
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:04,220
So, I'll be using that hour to play Apex Legends.

875
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,320
Because I'm allowed to.

876
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,000
Um, because I'm allowed to do whatever I want.

877
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,420
An hour before the sponsor stream.

878
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:13,140
And, you only have to watch 30 minutes to get your Twitch drops.

879
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,800
So, most likely on Twitch on Monday, it'll be at 4pm.

880
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:23,440
So, it's not gonna be as degenerate as the 9am one for Monday.

881
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:24,260
Or, for Sunday.

882
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,960
Sunday will be 9am.

883
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,080
Monday will be at 4pm.

884
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:32,480
And you just need to watch 30 minutes to get your Twitch drops, I believe.

885
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:38,700
Um, so, uh, so I will stream an hour of the Apex stuff before I go to the sponsor on Twitch.

886
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,620
Um, and, look.

887
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,320
For me, like, 9am is not an okay time for me to wake up.

888
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,060
Ha ha ha ha!

889
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,260
Ha ha ha!

890
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,620
Ha ha ha!

891
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:51,880
Ha ha ha!

892
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,620
So, I, for me, that's not okay for me.

893
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:03,120
Um, anyway, so, that is the whole life update situation.

894
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:12,840
Um, but on Twitch, uh, on Twitch, it will be 4pm, uh, for an hour of Apex for the Twitch drops.

895
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,720
And then we're gonna go straight to sponsor, which has not been confirmed yet.

896
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,220
So, that's why I can't give too much details on what it is.

897
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,720
But if it doesn't go through, um, actually, let me see.

898
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:27,360
Let me double check, because I know, like, I'll see if I have to sign anything yet.

899
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,360
No.

900
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:28,780
Okay.

901
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,120
So, um, nothing has been fully confirmed yet.

902
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:36,040
Um, because I haven't signed anything yet.

903
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,480
So, I'm just waiting on that.

904
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,460
And then when I...

905
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:42,220
when it's fully confirmed, then I'll, like, talk about it fully.

906
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:44,200
Uh...

907
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:49,400
Um, because I can't say anything about the sponsor until I sign something.

908
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,680
Uh...

909
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:53,480
Anyway.

910
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,700
We can finally play Simpsons.

911
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:57,140
Alright.

912
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,660
Life update over.

913
00:35:58,820 --> 00:35:59,720
That was a long...

914
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,120
I'm sorry.

915
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,940
That was a really long life update.

916
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,440
But now...

917
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,500
Now it's the gameplay time.

918
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:07,660
Um...

919
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:08,940
There was a lot of stuff.

920
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:09,240
Okay.

921
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,540
There was a lot of stuff to update you guys on.

922
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:12,440
To be fair.

923
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:12,840
Okay.

924
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,440
I should double check the sound, too.

925
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:14,760
I forgot.

926
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:15,040
Okay.

927
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,480
What was my Simpsons?

928
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,080
Simpsons...

929
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:20,440
Okay.

930
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,160
Simpsons...

931
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,720
20.6.

932
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:24,280
So, yeah.

933
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,040
I always write down what I have...

934
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:27,500
what...

935
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,220
what I have to put it on for long.

936
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:33,120
Also, for the people who are like, hee hee, she has to redo everything.

937
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:38,580
When my game crashed last night, or last time, I play this game, I replayed every...

938
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:41,460
You know, I replayed everything for us.

939
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,880
So, we don't have to replay the...

940
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,260
all the progress I've lost.

941
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,240
So, how much progress did I lose?

942
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,840
Well, um...

943
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,400
It was basically where...

944
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,440
It was basically...

945
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:55,780
Look, see?

946
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,000
It's like nothing bad has happened.

947
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:58,780
Like...

948
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,560
I made sure...

949
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,340
It was on the same day I had crashed out.

950
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,000
Okay?

951
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,820
It was the same day I crashed out.

952
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:09,520
Okay, guys?

953
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,240
And, um...

954
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,100
I...

955
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,520
I made sure...

956
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,820
I made sure...

957
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:17,280
We...

958
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,440
We...

959
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:22,120
We got back to where we were before I crashed out.

960
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:23,000
I...

961
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,380
Fuck.

962
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,620
Okay, I can't remember the controls.

963
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,100
Um...

964
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,780
Let me remember the controls before we do anything.

965
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:28,920
Okay, which car...

966
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,200
We'll do...

967
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:32,620
Fuck.

968
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:33,040
Okay.

969
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:34,920
We'll do Mr. Plow.

970
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,140
Mr. Plow for this.

971
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,660
I think Mr. Plow would be good.

972
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:38,960
Alright.

973
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,560
And we were...

974
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,840
So, basically...

975
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,860
Guys, I need to figure out the controls before...

976
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:44,420
Okay.

977
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,200
Okay, I need to figure out the controls.

978
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:47,880
Alright.

979
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:54,300
So, basically, when I crashed out and my game also crashed, I...

980
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:57,420
They put me back all the way to...

981
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:58,720
Before...

982
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,440
Oh my god, what was it?

983
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:03,080
They put me all the way to...

984
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,900
Heading to the retirement home.

985
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,820
So, I had to do all of that again.

986
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,160
So...

987
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,040
So...

988
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:16,520
Remember when I had to go drive to the school and get the...

989
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,960
And get the stupid colas?

990
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:18,920
Or whatever.

991
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:19,760
The buzz cola?

992
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,280
Yeah, I had to do all of that again.

993
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:27,880
So, I did all of that again on the day the game crashed out on me.

994
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:29,720
Alright.

995
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:30,900
It's okay.

996
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,440
But everything is fine now.

997
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:33,300
Uh...

998
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,920
Yes, the game crashed.

999
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:36,780
Star Ace.

1000
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,940
Thank you for the super chat.

1001
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:39,720
Thank you.

1002
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,260
Thank you.

1003
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:44,000
It is understandable to crash out on the Simpsons hit and run.

1004
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:48,560
If you didn't crash out on the Simpsons hit and run, you are a sociopath.

1005
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,060
You should get tested.

1006
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,500
That's what I'll say.

1007
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:57,520
If you've never crashed out playing this game, you should get tested.

1008
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:58,440
I...

1009
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,040
Oh my god.

1010
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,120
There's...

1011
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,700
There is no reason for you to not crash out.

1012
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:05,520
I...

1013
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,460
I will say that.

1014
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:11,180
Alright.

1015
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,400
Let's see.

1016
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,260
I can do this.

1017
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:14,600
Alright.

1018
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:15,760
Nice.

1019
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:16,800
Please.

1020
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,380
For real.

1021
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,500
Especially if you were a child.

1022
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:28,500
There's no way a child is most more emotionally mature than what you are now.

1023
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:34,320
I refuse to believe you were more emotionally mature than you were now as an adult.

1024
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:35,240
There is...

1025
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:44,340
Especially if you were a child going through purity, you have no fucking control of your emotions.

1026
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,480
That was me!

1027
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,440
Okay.

1028
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:50,500
It's okay, guys.

1029
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,980
I'm doing it.

1030
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,180
I'm figuring it out.

1031
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:54,440
I'm hitting the car.

1032
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:56,180
Okay.

1033
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:56,500
Nice.

1034
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:02,300
I didn't crash out, but I was a child.

1035
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,380
Loved the game a lot, even the last mission.

1036
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,020
What?

1037
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,580
Oh, no, no.

1038
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,360
Not the not the popo.

1039
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:15,660
Okay, I need to make sure I don't get the popo on me.

1040
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:17,620
Okay.

1041
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,060
We have to go now.

1042
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:23,020
Okay, I'm gonna I'm gonna let this cool down a little bit before I do anything.

1043
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:24,940
All right.

1044
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,600
Well, Martrico, thank you for the super chat.

1045
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,000
Thank you.

1046
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:28,600
Thank you.

1047
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:35,380
You were a very emotionally mentally mature child for you to not crash out on this fucking game.

1048
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:43,160
I'm gonna wait until like I'm gonna wait until I don't have the police wanting to you know arrest me.

1049
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:46,160
Give me the sec.

1050
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,200
All right.

1051
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:51,680
Joke's on you.

1052
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:54,360
I was already tested before playing this game.

1053
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,600
I turned out positive for autism.

1054
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,500
L, thank you for the super chat.

1055
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:02,060
Thank you.

1056
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:02,820
Thank you.

1057
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:08,300
At least at least you were a very mature child.

1058
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,740
At least you learned.

1059
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:12,900
At least you learned.

1060
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:13,920
All right.

1061
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:14,820
We gotta wait, guys.

1062
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:17,820
We're waiting because we don't want the police on me.

1063
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:18,760
All right.

1064
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,140
I don't want the police on me right now, so I gotta wait.

1065
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,020
We can play the waiting game, guys.

1066
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:29,220
We can play the waiting game.

1067
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,280
I'm not going through all of that again.

1068
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:32,960
We can do it.

1069
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,760
Gotta play the waiting game.

1070
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,040
All right, nice.

1071
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:41,820
All right, where is... whoops.

1072
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,780
I say as I start causing more havoc.

1073
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:49,400
It's causing more mayhem as I fucking do this.

1074
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,080
You can't go anywhere now.

1075
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,160
I blocked the only way to come in.

1076
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,000
That's right.

1077
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,100
What you gonna do?

1078
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,300
I blocked the only entrance.

1079
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,120
That's right.

1080
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:13,500
I blocked the only entrance.

1081
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,780
What you gonna do?

1082
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:17,040
Nothing.

1083
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,860
Oh, you're gonna do that?

1084
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:19,700
Okay, wait.

1085
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:20,400
Wait a minute.

1086
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,000
That doesn't follow my plan.

1087
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:25,000
What you gonna do?

1088
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,020
Nothing.

1089
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:27,300
Nothing.

1090
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:28,820
Oh, wait.

1091
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,940
You just drove around me.

1092
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:30,300
Okay.

1093
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,800
I should have expected that.

1094
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:38,240
Who would have thought that's what he's gonna do?

1095
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:39,540
Oh, yeah?

1096
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,180
I blocked this hole.

1097
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,200
What you gonna do now?

1098
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,340
Nothing.

1099
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:45,460
Nothing.

1100
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,600
I blocked the hole.

1101
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,820
That's right.

1102
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,360
That's right.

1103
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:54,680
That's right.

1104
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:56,220
Stop hitting yourself.

1105
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:58,540
I blocked the hole.

1106
00:42:58,760 --> 00:42:58,940
Oh!

1107
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:00,880
That's right.

1108
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:02,960
Now you definitely can't do anything.

1109
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:04,900
That's right.

1110
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:05,780
Keep hitting yourself.

1111
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:07,940
That's right.

1112
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,240
Keep hitting yourself.

1113
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:11,800
Oh, shit.

1114
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:12,520
Okay.

1115
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,220
It's fine.

1116
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:13,860
I can wait.

1117
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:16,240
That's fine.

1118
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,080
I can still wait.

1119
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,080
I blocked the only hole.

1120
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:20,460
Okay.

1121
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,700
This is fucking my camera.

1122
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:21,960
Okay.

1123
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:22,980
Maybe I should like...

1124
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:24,560
I don't know what's going on.

1125
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:26,920
Okay.

1126
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:27,240
Nice.

1127
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:27,460
Nice.

1128
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:29,160
He just has to hit himself one time.

1129
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:30,820
Oh, no.

1130
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:31,960
I feel like I fucked up.

1131
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,040
Oh, no.

1132
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:34,260
Oh, no.

1133
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:34,920
I played around.

1134
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,880
I played with the food for too long, guys.

1135
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:38,820
Oh, no.

1136
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:39,660
Guys.

1137
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:40,240
Nice.

1138
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:40,900
It doesn't matter.

1139
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:42,140
It doesn't matter.

1140
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:42,440
Okay.

1141
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:43,220
We wait.

1142
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:44,120
We...

1143
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:46,840
It's okay.

1144
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:47,620
I see him.

1145
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:49,380
He's right over there.

1146
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:51,040
Not even close.

1147
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,020
I see him.

1148
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,660
He's right over there.

1149
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:54,560
I can wait.

1150
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:55,400
All right.

1151
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:56,000
We're ready.

1152
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:57,040
Okay.

1153
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,380
Mr. Fucking truck.

1154
00:43:58,660 --> 00:43:59,060
Okay.

1155
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:00,440
He waited.

1156
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:00,920
Okay.

1157
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,720
That truck waited for me.

1158
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:04,160
I'm... Okay.

1159
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,280
That was actually bullshit.

1160
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:07,660
Oh, my God.

1161
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:10,020
This is a conspiracy right there.

1162
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:11,600
Okay.

1163
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:12,960
I need to find a wrench.

1164
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:14,320
I'm not okay right now.

1165
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,960
My car is not okay, guys.

1166
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,040
I actually need a wrench right now.

1167
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,180
Oh, no.

1168
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,800
Are there any nearby wrenches?

1169
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:23,460
Oh, no.

1170
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:25,220
Guys, I don't think I can...

1171
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:25,960
Oh, no.

1172
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:27,300
I need a wrench.

1173
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,160
Oh, there's a wrench right here.

1174
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:30,280
Thank God.

1175
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:32,300
Okay.

1176
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:32,500
Okay.

1177
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:33,380
I can continue.

1178
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:36,400
Fuck.

1179
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:37,260
It's okay.

1180
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,760
I can cut him out right here.

1181
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:41,540
All right.

1182
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:43,620
Where is he?

1183
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,180
There we go.

1184
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:47,540
It's fine.

1185
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:49,800
That's fine.

1186
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,480
That's fine.

1187
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:54,820
Oh, no.

1188
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:55,640
That's not fine.

1189
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:56,640
Oh, no.

1190
00:44:57,940 --> 00:44:58,640
Oh.

1191
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:01,240
No.

1192
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,840
I hit myself.

1193
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,220
Okay.

1194
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:05,540
I hate this.

1195
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:06,960
It's always the last truck.

1196
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:10,260
It's always the last bus cola.

1197
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,140
It's always the last one.

1198
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,060
Oh, my God.

1199
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:18,060
Hey, look at that turn, though.

1200
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:18,620
Okay.

1201
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,280
That turn was fucking sick, though.

1202
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:21,560
Not gonna lie.

1203
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:23,920
That was a sick-ass turn.

1204
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:25,240
Please.

1205
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:25,560
Hit that.

1206
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:25,800
Hit that.

1207
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:26,060
Hit that.

1208
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:26,460
Yes!

1209
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:29,620
Oh, my God.

1210
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:30,020
No!

1211
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:30,800
Oh, ho, ho!

1212
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:32,200
Oh,

1213
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:35,960
my God.

1214
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:36,340
Please.

1215
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:38,780
Please.

1216
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:50,620
Oh, my God.

1217
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:51,200
There's no way.

1218
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:51,820
And I'm fine.

1219
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:52,980
And I get busted.

1220
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,120
I can't.

1221
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,560
I can't.

1222
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,520
I fucking...

1223
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,320
I hate this car.

1224
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:04,340
Okay.

1225
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:05,260
I can do this.

1226
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:07,700
Okay.

1227
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:08,840
It's fine.

1228
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:09,540
I'm learning.

1229
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:10,340
I'm learning.

1230
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:11,700
I got better.

1231
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:12,420
I improved.

1232
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:13,280
I improved.

1233
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:14,920
The goddamn...

1234
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:15,520
Po, po!

1235
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:19,900
It looks so promising, too.

1236
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:22,460
It looks so promising.

1237
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,880
I finished the first car so fast.

1238
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:29,120
I made him hit himself.

1239
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:33,000
I played with my food for too long.

1240
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:34,900
Hit yourself.

1241
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,660
Hit yourself now.

1242
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:39,080
You got it.

1243
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:40,200
Okay.

1244
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:41,800
Nice.

1245
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,320
Oh, I just had that...

1246
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,380
Keep crashing that tree.

1247
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:46,340
Nice.

1248
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:47,460
Sorry about that.

1249
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:48,760
There we go.

1250
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:50,540
He's confused.

1251
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:51,880
That's good.

1252
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:54,400
Be confused.

1253
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:56,420
All right.

1254
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:57,460
Whoops.

1255
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:58,620
Ow.

1256
00:46:59,000 --> 00:46:59,760
My tushy.

1257
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:00,620
Yes, crash.

1258
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:02,340
Keep crashing.

1259
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:05,660
I hope they're all right.

1260
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:05,780
Okay.

1261
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:07,860
This is not fair.

1262
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:12,260
The police should exempt me from any arrest for what I'm doing.

1263
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:15,940
I am a law-abiding citizen trying to make sure the children stay safe.

1264
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:18,340
I am here for the children.

1265
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:20,820
Won't anyone think about the children?

1266
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,140
I don't understand.

1267
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:28,100
How am I a criminal when I'm doing this for the kids?

1268
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:28,180
Where is it?

1269
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:32,180
Okay.

1270
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:34,500
Oh.

1271
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:36,000
I...

1272
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:36,180
What?

1273
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:38,020
Okay, guys.

1274
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:38,680
Give me a sec.

1275
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,300
I have to deal with a hit and run right now.

1276
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:42,200
That's fine.

1277
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:45,420
Oh my god it's fine.

1278
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:48,380
That's fine.

1279
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:51,640
Oh my god thank god he like pushed me back.

1280
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,300
Can't catch me now cops.

1281
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,260
Okay wait he's right there.

1282
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:58,960
Wait the cops right behind me isn't he?

1283
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:00,780
It's fine.

1284
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:01,800
It's okay.

1285
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:03,380
I'm almost free.

1286
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:07,740
Come on it's so close.

1287
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,700
The cops can't catch me.

1288
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:09,940
No!

1289
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:11,180
Oh my god.

1290
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:15,400
Oh my god I'm nearly like one step behind the cops.

1291
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:17,860
Oh my god.

1292
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:19,780
No don't touch me.

1293
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:20,400
Don't touch me.

1294
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,200
Don't touch me!

1295
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:28,660
Please!

1296
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,000
Okay everything's okay.

1297
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:34,460
Yay!

1298
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:36,320
It's alright.

1299
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:37,820
I'm with the kids now.

1300
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,420
Oh it's fine.

1301
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:43,980
Save the person running over kids.

1302
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,340
Young thank you for the super chat.

1303
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:46,800
Thank you.

1304
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:47,520
Thank you.

1305
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,180
Alright next car.

1306
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:51,340
Save.

1307
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:55,760
Okay next car time.

1308
00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:00,320
The third one is the most frustrating I would have to say.

1309
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:02,880
The third one is so fucking frustrating.

1310
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:06,700
Yeah see he doesn't regret anything.

1311
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,440
I'm a law abiding citizen.

1312
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:10,400
Move out of the way.

1313
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,940
I'm also a cop.

1314
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:11,980
I'm also a cop.

1315
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:15,040
Alright.

1316
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:17,740
What you gonna do?

1317
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:18,560
I blocked the hole.

1318
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,140
That's fucking right.

1319
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:26,140
I should have looked up speedrun strats for this.

1320
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:30,040
I should have.

1321
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:36,140
Like I should be legally allowed to look up speedrun strats for this game.

1322
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:37,680
I hate this game.

1323
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,480
Just for this part.

1324
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:40,200
Just.

1325
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,940
Just for this part guys.

1326
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,780
Like anybody would have agreed.

1327
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,280
With me.

1328
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,640
That this has to be one of the more frustrating levels.

1329
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:53,160
The ramming ones are definitely the more frustrating ones.

1330
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:56,880
Alright.

1331
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:59,380
Like how do they do this?

1332
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,620
How do you speedrun this?

1333
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,340
Just hit yourself.

1334
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:04,800
Keep hitting yourself.

1335
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:05,800
Yes.

1336
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:07,140
Yes.

1337
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:09,920
Yes.

1338
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:10,920
Keep doing that.

1339
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,080
Keep doing that.

1340
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:13,740
No.

1341
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,000
Why did you stop?

1342
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,880
How did you get through the gold?

1343
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:24,420
I don't understand.

1344
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:26,220
Okay.

1345
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:26,660
Nice.

1346
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:27,300
There we go.

1347
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:27,580
Okay.

1348
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:28,720
I figured that part out.

1349
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:28,980
Guys.

1350
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:30,460
I'm figuring out the speedrun strats.

1351
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:30,760
Guys.

1352
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,360
I'm figuring it out.

1353
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,460
I'm making my own speedrun tech right now.

1354
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:38,640
This is it.

1355
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:40,320
I'm trademarking the tech.

1356
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:41,820
My tech.

1357
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:42,520
My tech right here.

1358
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:45,120
Okay.

1359
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,760
I call it.

1360
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:48,880
I call it.

1361
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:49,500
The.

1362
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,760
When there's a hole.

1363
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:55,720
There's a goal.

1364
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,220
Block the hole.

1365
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:03,120
Okay.

1366
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:07,320
Okay.

1367
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:09,700
This one is so hard because there's no actual area.

1368
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:11,720
area to like lock the hole.

1369
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:13,780
Alright.

1370
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:15,860
Let's see.

1371
00:51:20,070 --> 00:51:20,670
Alright.

1372
00:51:21,450 --> 00:51:21,810
Oh my god.

1373
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:22,770
This one is so difficult.

1374
00:51:22,970 --> 00:51:25,270
Like there's like no area for you to actually ram.

1375
00:51:25,850 --> 00:51:26,630
Oh wait.

1376
00:51:26,810 --> 00:51:27,390
I did it though.

1377
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:28,770
I rammed it.

1378
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:31,870
Okay.

1379
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:32,990
Halfway.

1380
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:37,950
I'm always like just short from killing this car.

1381
00:51:38,490 --> 00:51:40,370
Like just almost there.

1382
00:51:44,010 --> 00:51:44,730
Come on.

1383
00:51:44,850 --> 00:51:44,970
Come on.

1384
00:51:44,970 --> 00:51:45,250
Oh my god.

1385
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:45,850
I flipped it.

1386
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:46,170
Flip.

1387
00:51:46,290 --> 00:51:47,910
Flipping it should be bonus points.

1388
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:48,810
You know like.

1389
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:49,630
Like Tony Hawk.

1390
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:50,810
Like radical.

1391
00:51:52,530 --> 00:51:54,850
That should be a style point right there.

1392
00:51:55,110 --> 00:51:58,330
It does like extra damage every time you flip the truck.

1393
00:51:58,330 --> 00:51:59,910
move it or lose it buster.

1394
00:52:01,310 --> 00:52:03,110
That should be a style point.

1395
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:05,110
Just like Tony Hawk.

1396
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:14,410
Oh my god.

1397
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:16,550
I don't understand.

1398
00:52:16,690 --> 00:52:18,770
I'm ramming it as much as I can.

1399
00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:20,890
Oh it rammed itself.

1400
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:23,170
Oh thank god.

1401
00:52:23,370 --> 00:52:23,470
Okay.

1402
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:24,110
Guys.

1403
00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:25,190
I figured it out.

1404
00:52:25,790 --> 00:52:26,030
Guys.

1405
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:27,270
Okay.

1406
00:52:27,810 --> 00:52:28,110
Alright.

1407
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:29,550
Guys.

1408
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:30,570
I figured it out.

1409
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:30,990
Guys.

1410
00:52:31,830 --> 00:52:32,330
Guys.

1411
00:52:32,510 --> 00:52:33,330
I figured it out.

1412
00:52:33,370 --> 00:52:33,490
Guys.

1413
00:52:33,490 --> 00:52:33,490
Guys.

1414
00:52:33,490 --> 00:52:33,490
I figured it out.

1415
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:34,650
Guys.

1416
00:52:34,650 --> 00:52:34,810
Guys.

1417
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:35,090
I figured it out.

1418
00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:35,950
My speedrun tech.

1419
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:36,970
I trademarked it.

1420
00:52:37,230 --> 00:52:38,190
Don't worry.

1421
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:39,150
Don't worry.

1422
00:52:39,350 --> 00:52:41,530
I know what comes up after this, guys.

1423
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:42,950
But don't worry.

1424
00:52:43,110 --> 00:52:44,990
I have the strat.

1425
00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:47,690
Guys, don't worry, guys.

1426
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:49,350
I have the strat.

1427
00:52:51,430 --> 00:52:52,690
Guys, don't worry.

1428
00:52:55,970 --> 00:52:57,730
I have the strat.

1429
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:06,230
Don't worry.

1430
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:17,590
Guys, I... This is to prove, you guys, that I read my YouTube comments.

1431
00:53:20,770 --> 00:53:38,650
Someone was like, after that stream, someone commented, was like, it's really funny that Dookie crashed out on that chase because all she had to do was go into the house and then she would have completed the mission.

1432
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:45,310
And that is the proof to you guys that I do read my YouTube comments.

1433
00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:54,070
You did just for this one.

1434
00:53:55,430 --> 00:53:58,930
I wish I knew that years ago.

1435
00:53:59,150 --> 00:54:00,470
Why am I a poo now?

1436
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:00,950
What?

1437
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:01,030
What?

1438
00:54:01,310 --> 00:54:03,270
It just... No cutscene?

1439
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:04,490
I'm just a poo?

1440
00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:06,710
How did I get here?

1441
00:54:07,270 --> 00:54:08,590
How did I get here?

1442
00:54:08,590 --> 00:54:09,070
How did...

1443
00:54:09,070 --> 00:54:10,270
Dookie can read.

1444
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:12,450
There you go.

1445
00:54:13,870 --> 00:54:16,110
How did... How did I become a poo?

1446
00:54:17,050 --> 00:54:18,490
I'm just him now?

1447
00:54:19,310 --> 00:54:22,570
Krono, thank you for the 50 gifted chips.

1448
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:23,110
Thank you.

1449
00:54:23,310 --> 00:54:23,870
Thank you.

1450
00:54:23,870 --> 00:54:25,470
I told you guys.

1451
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:27,690
I told you I had the strat.

1452
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:31,770
I came in prepared for hit and run.

1453
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:35,910
I'm bombed him.

1454
00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:37,750
Alright, whoops.

1455
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:38,470
Sorry, Gil.

1456
00:54:40,270 --> 00:54:44,350
Please ignore the things I posted in the YouTube comments.

1457
00:54:45,070 --> 00:54:46,610
Nexy, thank you for the super chat.

1458
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:46,970
Thank you.

1459
00:54:47,110 --> 00:54:47,430
Thank you.

1460
00:54:47,610 --> 00:54:49,910
Wait, I wanna buy... Wait, is the police car good?

1461
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:51,570
Is that a good investment?

1462
00:54:52,550 --> 00:54:53,110
Guys...

1463
00:54:53,110 --> 00:54:56,070
Being the police...

1464
00:54:56,070 --> 00:54:59,010
Am I exempt from the crap... from the law?

1465
00:54:59,330 --> 00:55:01,170
Oh my god, get over here!

1466
00:55:01,350 --> 00:55:02,550
You fucker!

1467
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:05,090
It's decent, or is it bad?

1468
00:55:05,550 --> 00:55:06,810
Is Gil trying to scam me?

1469
00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:07,750
Cuz that's Gil thing.

1470
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:10,570
That's a Gil thing to do.

1471
00:55:11,790 --> 00:55:12,930
It's not that good?

1472
00:55:13,090 --> 00:55:13,270
Okay.

1473
00:55:14,970 --> 00:55:16,470
Alright, I won't buy it.

1474
00:55:17,810 --> 00:55:20,150
Wait, she can't go get the...

1475
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,930
Oh, I have to get the car made for Homer?

1476
00:55:22,930 --> 00:55:24,990
Wait, let me grab this bee first.

1477
00:55:25,510 --> 00:55:26,510
Actually, no, I feel...

1478
00:55:26,510 --> 00:55:27,290
I actually...

1479
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:29,570
Oh my god, I'm gonna...

1480
00:55:31,010 --> 00:55:31,530
Goddamn...

1481
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:31,770
Oh!

1482
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:35,170
Get over here.

1483
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:36,070
Alright, nice.

1484
00:55:37,810 --> 00:55:38,330
Alright.

1485
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:40,910
Nice, okay.

1486
00:55:41,410 --> 00:55:41,970
It's fine.

1487
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:44,330
I need to go grab a car.

1488
00:55:44,330 --> 00:55:45,730
I need to grab my own car.

1489
00:55:46,190 --> 00:55:47,370
Where is my car?

1490
00:55:48,070 --> 00:55:49,710
Wait, is that my car over there?

1491
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:50,110
Oh!

1492
00:55:50,270 --> 00:55:51,190
Is that my car?

1493
00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:51,930
Whoops!

1494
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:53,350
It's like...

1495
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:54,470
Where is my car?

1496
00:55:54,770 --> 00:55:55,230
Hey, Apu!

1497
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:59,050
I'll take six packs of bugs, cool, and at least expire hot dogs you have.

1498
00:55:59,730 --> 00:55:59,970
Soto!

1499
00:56:00,210 --> 00:56:01,110
Thank you for the super chat!

1500
00:56:01,290 --> 00:56:02,090
Thank you!

1501
00:56:02,210 --> 00:56:02,690
Thank you!

1502
00:56:02,810 --> 00:56:03,310
Come again!

1503
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:04,690
Whoops!

1504
00:56:04,850 --> 00:56:05,410
Sorry, lady!

1505
00:56:06,350 --> 00:56:07,450
Alright, this way.

1506
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:12,990
Forgot he has a convertible, because he didn't think he had eight kids.

1507
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:14,870
Where's the six kids?

1508
00:56:14,990 --> 00:56:15,590
I've lost count.

1509
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:16,530
He has a lot of kids.

1510
00:56:18,330 --> 00:56:18,570
Alright.

1511
00:56:19,170 --> 00:56:19,730
Let's see.

1512
00:56:21,370 --> 00:56:23,870
And this was before Octuplets was a thing.

1513
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:28,570
I wonder how she's doing.

1514
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:29,150
Yup.

1515
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:30,970
The Octuplets mom.

1516
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:33,950
I wonder how she's doing over there.

1517
00:56:34,470 --> 00:56:36,750
Last thing I heard about her is that...

1518
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:40,270
They divorced and then she did porn?

1519
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:42,830
That was the last thing I heard about her.

1520
00:56:42,950 --> 00:56:44,810
And then she became irrelevant after that.

1521
00:56:45,050 --> 00:56:46,190
Because everything just...

1522
00:56:46,190 --> 00:56:47,830
Everybody was just like...

1523
00:56:47,830 --> 00:56:50,090
Talking about her because of like...

1524
00:56:50,670 --> 00:56:51,430
Oh yeah!

1525
00:56:51,730 --> 00:56:52,710
If you guys didn't know that.

1526
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:57,330
Like, her and that other guy got divorced and then she did porn.

1527
00:56:57,930 --> 00:56:59,470
And then that's all I heard.

1528
00:57:00,330 --> 00:57:00,950
What, who?

1529
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:01,890
The Octumom!

1530
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:03,590
You know?

1531
00:57:03,730 --> 00:57:04,230
The...

1532
00:57:04,230 --> 00:57:06,990
There was a whole reality show about it and everything.

1533
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:09,590
And...

1534
00:57:09,590 --> 00:57:09,830
No!

1535
00:57:09,990 --> 00:57:11,950
I'm talking about a real person!

1536
00:57:12,370 --> 00:57:13,790
Not Apu's wife!

1537
00:57:14,970 --> 00:57:16,890
Apu's wife isn't real!

1538
00:57:19,730 --> 00:57:23,550
I'm talking about the real woman that had eight children.

1539
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:25,890
Yeah, Kate plus eight.

1540
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:27,510
You know how...

1541
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:29,330
It was not Kate plus eight?

1542
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:30,410
It was like...

1543
00:57:30,410 --> 00:57:31,850
Kate and her husband.

1544
00:57:32,270 --> 00:57:33,170
I forgot his name.

1545
00:57:33,370 --> 00:57:33,690
But...

1546
00:57:33,690 --> 00:57:37,090
Like, he was obviously like the least relevant guy in that show.

1547
00:57:37,510 --> 00:57:38,190
Like, in...

1548
00:57:38,190 --> 00:57:39,250
In the family.

1549
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:40,590
But like...

1550
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:41,070
Um...

1551
00:57:41,070 --> 00:57:42,910
The show was John and...

1552
00:57:42,910 --> 00:57:45,050
I like how everybody says Kate plus eight.

1553
00:57:45,290 --> 00:57:47,710
But not John and Kate plus eight!

1554
00:57:47,810 --> 00:57:50,410
Everyone already forgot about John!

1555
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:53,610
No!

1556
00:57:53,830 --> 00:57:54,210
There was!

1557
00:57:54,330 --> 00:57:55,890
There was a real person!

1558
00:57:56,230 --> 00:57:56,630
Behind!

1559
00:57:57,310 --> 00:57:58,750
There was a real...

1560
00:57:58,750 --> 00:57:59,510
Well...

1561
00:57:59,510 --> 00:57:59,810
Apu...

1562
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:00,630
Apu was first.

1563
00:58:00,950 --> 00:58:02,310
Apu had the first...

1564
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:04,510
Oh, I have to do something about this Buzzkoda.

1565
00:58:05,210 --> 00:58:05,510
I...

1566
00:58:05,510 --> 00:58:06,850
What if I kick it now?

1567
00:58:08,390 --> 00:58:08,990
Wait!

1568
00:58:09,210 --> 00:58:09,930
Oh my god!

1569
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:10,970
What if...

1570
00:58:11,370 --> 00:58:12,110
What if...

1571
00:58:12,110 --> 00:58:13,970
I smash into the car?

1572
00:58:14,670 --> 00:58:15,030
I...

1573
00:58:15,030 --> 00:58:16,250
Accepted the mission accidentally.

1574
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:16,930
I...

1575
00:58:16,930 --> 00:58:17,130
I...

1576
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:21,990
Unless I redeem myself, I will be reincarnated as a sea cucumber.

1577
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:23,170
Or worse...

1578
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:23,430
Wait!

1579
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:26,990
I must find the source of this evil beverage.

1580
00:58:27,550 --> 00:58:30,930
The soda invoice commanded I go here, but I see no cola factory.

1581
00:58:31,490 --> 00:58:31,970
Oh!

1582
00:58:32,270 --> 00:58:33,490
I just have to chase it?

1583
00:58:33,590 --> 00:58:34,170
Okay, okay.

1584
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:35,090
I was gonna save.

1585
00:58:35,090 --> 00:58:36,250
I have to crash into it.

1586
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:37,190
I'll pre-crash it.

1587
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:39,930
I was gonna pre-crash it.

1588
00:58:39,930 --> 00:58:40,790
There was no bounds!

1589
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:46,620
John did have a midlife crisis.

1590
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,980
Cause he thought he was more important than the show.

1591
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:54,480
But obviously, everybody felt... followed Cade over John.

1592
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:57,720
I mean, everybody nearly went like, oh, you mean Cade plus A?

1593
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:00,040
I was like, you guys do know it was...

1594
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:02,760
There was a second guy in that show, right?

1595
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:06,700
There was the father, too.

1596
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:11,040
It was John and Cade plus A.

1597
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:11,960
Okay.

1598
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:12,620
Not just...

1599
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:14,060
Not just Cade.

1600
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:16,680
Okay.

1601
00:59:18,850 --> 00:59:20,160
Oh no, Apu.

1602
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:22,220
Whoa!

1603
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:23,800
Oh my god.

1604
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:25,960
Bro, that looked so cool.

1605
00:59:27,790 --> 00:59:28,180
Okay.

1606
00:59:36,830 --> 00:59:39,840
Ooh, the Indian chase music goes hard on this.

1607
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:40,480
It's...

1608
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,840
I think my favorite Indian song is...

1609
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:44,060
What is it?

1610
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:46,060
Tuluk, tuluk, tuluk.

1611
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,280
That was my favorite.

1612
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:51,060
Cause I love the lore behind...

1613
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:53,160
I love the lore behind the song.

1614
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:54,880
The tunuk, tunuk.

1615
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,260
That's one of my favorite Indian songs.

1616
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:02,280
The lore behind that song is that...

1617
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:03,100
Um...

1618
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:04,080
Was that...

1619
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:05,060
The reason why...

1620
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:05,660
Was that...

1621
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:07,500
Before he did that music video...

1622
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:09,280
Everyone was saying...

1623
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:12,420
His criticism was that his music is only popular...

1624
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:14,280
Because he has like beautiful women...

1625
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:15,620
Um...

1626
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:17,880
And background dancers in his song...

1627
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:18,700
In his music videos.

1628
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:20,580
And that's why his music is so popular.

1629
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:21,900
So he...

1630
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:22,980
Did the...

1631
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:23,940
Tunuk, tunuk song...

1632
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:26,320
To prove to everybody that...

1633
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:30,780
His songs don't need beautiful backup dancers to be popular.

1634
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:32,920
There.

1635
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:34,340
Oh my god!

1636
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:35,760
Oh my god!

1637
01:00:36,020 --> 01:00:36,900
This is a conspiracy!

1638
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,520
Are you fucking kidding me?

1639
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:40,340
No way!

1640
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:43,600
No fucking way did that car do that to me!

1641
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:44,600
I...

1642
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:47,540
He started a...

1643
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:49,440
God damn car crash!

1644
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:53,460
Yeah, he did.

1645
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:55,700
Yeah, so he proved to everybody...

1646
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:56,900
That like...

1647
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:59,100
He didn't need beautiful women...

1648
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:02,100
And that he can just make an extremely popular song...

1649
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:03,040
Oh hey!

1650
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:03,840
It's the pen pals!

1651
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,280
With just...

1652
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:05,500
Himself!

1653
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:07,120
I mean, it worked!

1654
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:08,320
Wait, what's in here?

1655
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:09,140
The legitimate...

1656
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:10,600
The legitimate business social club.

1657
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:11,840
What's in here?

1658
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:12,600
I wanna go in here!

1659
01:01:15,020 --> 01:01:15,880
Wait, I wanna...

1660
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:16,500
I'm in!

1661
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:20,940
I'm a legitimate business owner!

1662
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:24,140
And he was...

1663
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:25,760
Yeah, now it's his most popular song!

1664
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:27,720
And now even people overseas know him!

1665
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:30,500
But then he went...

1666
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:31,780
Okay, look...

1667
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:32,140
He can't...

1668
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:33,700
He can't stop himself from being...

1669
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:34,160
Look...

1670
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:37,160
He can't stop himself from being beautiful, okay?

1671
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:38,500
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1672
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:41,540
Okay...

1673
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:42,820
Jammo, thank you for the super chat!

1674
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:43,640
Thank you, thank you!

1675
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:46,700
I used to give my controller bite marks because of this game.

1676
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:47,980
Yeah, I can see why.

1677
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:49,020
I can see why.

1678
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:50,700
This is a game to like...

1679
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:51,720
Torture your little children.

1680
01:01:55,490 --> 01:01:55,930
Oh...

1681
01:01:55,930 --> 01:01:59,170
Okay, I have so much money to give to the cops soon.

1682
01:01:59,170 --> 01:02:00,950
Ha ha ha ha!

1683
01:02:01,410 --> 01:02:02,590
Look at all my...

1684
01:02:02,590 --> 01:02:05,570
Look at the amount of bail money that I have, guys!

1685
01:02:05,970 --> 01:02:07,150
Oh my god!

1686
01:02:07,810 --> 01:02:09,790
So much bail money!

1687
01:02:10,090 --> 01:02:10,810
Oh shit!

1688
01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:12,530
I'm just gonna fuck this up, aren't I?

1689
01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:13,690
No, no!

1690
01:02:13,770 --> 01:02:14,570
That was so close!

1691
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:15,530
You almost shot me!

1692
01:02:16,250 --> 01:02:18,110
Look at all my bail money!

1693
01:02:18,430 --> 01:02:18,610
Woo!

1694
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:19,430
Woooo!

1695
01:02:20,850 --> 01:02:21,590
Okay, nice.

1696
01:02:22,130 --> 01:02:22,650
Busted!

1697
01:02:22,910 --> 01:02:23,690
Minus 50!

1698
01:02:24,010 --> 01:02:26,910
Now I can get arrested by a cop seven more times!

1699
01:02:28,290 --> 01:02:29,270
I don't wanna...

1700
01:02:29,270 --> 01:02:29,810
I don't know.

1701
01:02:29,930 --> 01:02:31,410
I don't have Apu costumes here.

1702
01:02:31,510 --> 01:02:32,430
There's no costumes.

1703
01:02:32,810 --> 01:02:36,470
I think it's also the fact that Apu hasn't been...

1704
01:02:36,470 --> 01:02:39,230
They haven't used Apu for so long.

1705
01:02:39,230 --> 01:02:40,010
Which sucks.

1706
01:02:40,050 --> 01:02:41,170
I know like the reason why.

1707
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:42,310
But like, you know...

1708
01:02:42,310 --> 01:02:44,170
He was still like a beloved character.

1709
01:02:44,790 --> 01:02:45,350
And...

1710
01:02:45,350 --> 01:02:48,430
Since he had his own character arcs and everything in the show.

1711
01:02:48,710 --> 01:02:49,330
But like...

1712
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:50,010
I...

1713
01:02:50,010 --> 01:02:52,830
The fact that like Apu hasn't been around for so long.

1714
01:02:53,090 --> 01:02:56,630
There's like no costume that I really care to have from Apu.

1715
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:02,440
Yeah, he has a really good backstory.

1716
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:03,360
Yeah.

1717
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:04,400
Oh wait!

1718
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:05,220
A dress!

1719
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:06,640
Okay, I take it back.

1720
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:07,940
American Apu.

1721
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:13,180
I take it all back.

1722
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,640
American Apu was pretty good.

1723
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:16,460
I...

1724
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:16,680
I...

1725
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:18,060
I...

1726
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:18,980
I...

1727
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:20,540
I...

1728
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:20,720
I...

1729
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:20,940
I...

1730
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:23,520
I...

1731
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:26,500
American Apu.

1732
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:29,800
From that episode.

1733
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:34,500
That's right, I have a simulated into America now.

1734
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:36,280
Oh shit.

1735
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:37,240
Oh hey, it's...

1736
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:37,900
What is it called?

1737
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:39,420
I forgot what the mo...

1738
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:40,920
The mow drink that is.

1739
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:41,640
It's...

1740
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:42,080
Fire.

1741
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:44,700
I've sold my kidneys three times.

1742
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:46,880
I have no idea what's keeping me alive.

1743
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:47,740
Haha, okay.

1744
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:49,440
How are you in this fine day?

1745
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:51,720
Yeah, I didn't get nearly as much money...

1746
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:52,940
Oh yeah, the flaming homer!

1747
01:03:53,140 --> 01:03:54,740
You mean the flaming moe, guys.

1748
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:56,800
No, no, no, it's the flaming moe.

1749
01:03:56,940 --> 01:04:00,180
I went to the... one of the Universal Studios and got a flaming moe.

1750
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,040
Like the... the cup for it?

1751
01:04:02,660 --> 01:04:06,760
Hey, I've got to pay protection to 11 separate criminal organizations.

1752
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:09,440
Let's see, like, my love tester.

1753
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:10,940
What am I?

1754
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:13,060
Am I a... Oh, I'm a cat!

1755
01:04:13,180 --> 01:04:14,260
Oh, I'm a cold fish.

1756
01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:16,280
That's okay, guys.

1757
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:18,100
This machine is busted.

1758
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:20,480
Bye!

1759
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:21,180
What did I win?

1760
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:24,480
What does it taste like?

1761
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:25,360
It was years ago.

1762
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:27,080
I don't remember, but I still have the cup for it.

1763
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:29,260
I actually don't remember, uh...

1764
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:31,880
Um, what it tasted like.

1765
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:34,240
I should say my game.

1766
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:34,920
You're right, guys.

1767
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:37,800
You're right, in case it crashes again.

1768
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:38,400
Haha!

1769
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:40,520
A pet.

1770
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:41,720
How are you this fine day?

1771
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:44,380
I just found out my genitals of cauliflower.

1772
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:45,140
What?

1773
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:45,840
That's very rare.

1774
01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:47,860
How does that even happen?

1775
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:49,060
Greetings, loyal customer.

1776
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:51,540
God help me, I love books on tape.

1777
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:53,560
How are you this fine day?

1778
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:54,820
Are you saying I'm ugly?

1779
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:56,040
Cause I am.

1780
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:57,980
Greetings, loyal customer.

1781
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:01,460
Uh, I'm out of doves, so you gotta drink balsamic vinegar.

1782
01:05:01,540 --> 01:05:02,440
You know, they retcon...

1783
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:04,440
They retconned Moe so much.

1784
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:09,420
Oh yeah, I think the voice actor for Moe is one of the most highly paid voice actors on the show.

1785
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:13,560
Because apparently he voices like a million other characters on The Simpsons.

1786
01:05:14,060 --> 01:05:18,200
Um, but like they retconned Moe so fucking much, it's actually crazy.

1787
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:23,720
Cause one of the retcon was that the reason why he's so ugly is that he used to be a normal looking boy.

1788
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:28,320
And then like he gone through a horrific, like, accident that made him ugly.

1789
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:31,080
And then, but then there's like other retcons too.

1790
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:32,380
I don't remember the other reasons.

1791
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:33,720
I don't...

1792
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:35,800
Um...

1793
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:36,000
Uh...

1794
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:36,660
Igna, thank you.

1795
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:37,680
Welcome to tomato farm.

1796
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:38,420
Welcome, welcome.

1797
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:45,380
Oh yeah, he's married to the, the dwarf girl now.

1798
01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:47,640
By the way, yeah, he has like so...

1799
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:48,860
Wait, is he married?

1800
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:50,000
I don't remember.

1801
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:51,520
They retconned that too.

1802
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:57,860
So like, he bumped into this like, uh, this girl who was a dwarf.

1803
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:03,000
And like, um, and it was, it was a little person.

1804
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:04,760
Wait, is that the correct term?

1805
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:05,480
I forgot.

1806
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:06,400
Little person, right?

1807
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:08,000
Who was a little person?

1808
01:06:08,180 --> 01:06:08,880
Or is, sorry.

1809
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:10,360
Like, she didn't suddenly grow taller.

1810
01:06:11,140 --> 01:06:11,700
Um...

1811
01:06:13,860 --> 01:06:14,420
I...

1812
01:06:14,420 --> 01:06:15,840
She, she still is.

1813
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:20,460
She didn't just suddenly just stop being a little person.

1814
01:06:20,460 --> 01:06:23,600
And then they, she like, fell in love with like...

1815
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:24,940
Oh look, I'm too, I'm American!

1816
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:25,680
Yeehaw!

1817
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:29,880
I'm American!

1818
01:06:30,060 --> 01:06:30,480
Yeehaw!

1819
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:32,860
And so, the story is that...

1820
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:34,580
He fell in love with a little person.

1821
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,560
And, um, she like, disappeared.

1822
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:39,700
And like, broke up with him.

1823
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:41,940
It was all one episode, by the way.

1824
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:44,920
And then later on, he like, found her again.

1825
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:47,800
Cause they were like, I can't stop thinking about you.

1826
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:48,800
And everything.

1827
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:51,260
And then they were gonna get engaged and everything.

1828
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:53,540
And then I think she like, ran out.

1829
01:06:53,620 --> 01:06:54,120
I don't know.

1830
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:56,680
I don't remember how the episode ended.

1831
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,520
But like, they got together and then she never appeared anymore.

1832
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:01,380
Yeah, she returned.

1833
01:07:01,620 --> 01:07:02,200
She returned.

1834
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,880
And then they got back together and were engaged.

1835
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:07,880
And then like, I don't know what happened to her.

1836
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:14,260
And then it just, they just sort of like, forgot about that storyline.

1837
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:18,660
Like, I mean, Groundskeeper Willy also got married too.

1838
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:21,060
But they didn't really do anything with the wife.

1839
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:25,140
No, she didn't die.

1840
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:26,640
She was, she faked her death.

1841
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:32,920
But like, I remember she like, faked her death or some shit.

1842
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:36,940
Yeah, they, they got engaged.

1843
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:38,660
But they haven't done anything with her.

1844
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:40,880
She like, disappeared at one point.

1845
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:42,200
You're no stereotypical Italians.

1846
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:44,860
Pleased to tell me the source of the evil cola.

1847
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:46,060
We don't know nothing.

1848
01:07:46,580 --> 01:07:49,000
Except that the vans are controlled by mysterious strangers.

1849
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:49,580
What?

1850
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:52,500
Anyway, you shouldn't stick your nose in other people's business.

1851
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:53,980
It could come back the whole...

1852
01:07:53,980 --> 01:07:58,520
Mo asked if little person was the correct term when we first met her too.

1853
01:07:58,820 --> 01:08:01,040
I liked them as a couple, so I was sad they broke up.

1854
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:02,140
No, they're back together now.

1855
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:03,480
Rodrigo.

1856
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:04,960
Thank you to the super chat.

1857
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:05,340
Thank you.

1858
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:05,980
Thank you.

1859
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:11,120
Oh no.

1860
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:12,880
We're back together!

1861
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:13,560
Yippee!

1862
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:16,480
Wait, am I going the right way?

1863
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:18,000
Oh, it's this way.

1864
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:21,180
Wait.

1865
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:22,900
Wait, can I just...

1866
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:23,140
Wait.

1867
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:25,040
Guys, I have an idea.

1868
01:08:32,540 --> 01:08:33,360
Yippee!

1869
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:37,720
Yippee!

1870
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:38,640
Yippee!

1871
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:39,900
Yippee!

1872
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:41,040
I figured it out.

1873
01:08:41,580 --> 01:08:44,740
I was like, if this works for the house.

1874
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:46,820
This shit... Wait, okay.

1875
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,520
I have to do this again because my... Oh, no.

1876
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:52,640
My car might explode before I get home, though.

1877
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:55,640
My car was like, I figured it out.

1878
01:08:56,020 --> 01:08:58,380
No more crashing out for me.

1879
01:08:58,380 --> 01:08:59,220
Oh, no.

1880
01:08:59,820 --> 01:09:00,720
Oh, no.

1881
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:01,500
Give me a sec.

1882
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:04,080
I need to... Oh, no.

1883
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:07,140
Okay, I have 15 seconds to get to the hospital.

1884
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:09,120
I don't know if I'll make it.

1885
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:14,860
Guys, I may or may not have fucked around too much.

1886
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:15,800
Oh, my God.

1887
01:09:15,940 --> 01:09:16,700
Are you serious?

1888
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:18,080
Are you serious?

1889
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:19,840
Is there anywhere I could go?

1890
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:23,840
Is there any... Please, are there any taverns I could go?

1891
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:24,320
Oh, wait.

1892
01:09:24,340 --> 01:09:24,740
I did it.

1893
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:27,080
Okay, I just drove around.

1894
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:27,700
That's fine.

1895
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:30,360
All right, here you go.

1896
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:33,580
Yay!

1897
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:35,020
Thank you.

1898
01:09:35,140 --> 01:09:35,460
Come here.

1899
01:09:35,820 --> 01:09:36,760
I should come in my pants for this.

1900
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:40,080
Let Dougie take... Oh, Dr. Hibbard!

1901
01:09:46,180 --> 01:09:46,860
Oh, no.

1902
01:09:47,420 --> 01:09:48,000
Oh, yeah.

1903
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:49,720
And then they gave him...

1904
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:49,900
Oh.

1905
01:09:50,460 --> 01:09:51,760
What happened to the babies?

1906
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:53,520
Diapers aren't covered by your insurance.

1907
01:09:53,780 --> 01:09:54,020
No!

1908
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:55,440
You better hurry.

1909
01:09:55,540 --> 01:09:58,600
I heard the parents of the Shelbyville 9 are grabbing every diaper in town.

1910
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:02,160
I will get the diapers, but there's no way I could fit them in my car.

1911
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:06,660
Maybe Mr. Homer will have a large gas-guzzling American vehicle that I could use.

1912
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:11,460
You'll need to purchase Homer's custom-built car.

1913
01:10:11,780 --> 01:10:14,140
Purchase it from the Homer's parking...

1914
01:10:14,580 --> 01:10:17,340
Homer in the hospital, park it for $500, call it from a phone booth.

1915
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:18,140
No!

1916
01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:22,540
I spent all my money to be American!

1917
01:10:24,660 --> 01:10:26,440
The American dream!

1918
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:31,300
Oh, no.

1919
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:34,480
Here you go.

1920
01:10:35,420 --> 01:10:38,060
Truly the American dream!

1921
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:40,220
Too real!

1922
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:45,500
I spent all my money trying to be American!

1923
01:10:46,180 --> 01:10:51,460
How would I know I have to get $500 more?!

1924
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:53,080
How?!

1925
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:53,460
How?!

1926
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:57,520
The American experience, alright.

1927
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:00,020
It's time to farm money, guys.

1928
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:03,080
It's time to farm money.

1929
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:04,940
Have no...

1930
01:11:04,940 --> 01:11:05,300
Oh, yeah.

1931
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:06,960
Sorry, I was saying thank you to the super chat.

1932
01:11:07,060 --> 01:11:07,740
What the fuck?

1933
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:08,540
Monkey delivery.

1934
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:10,280
Bye, monkeys.

1935
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:12,600
Where's the monkey gonna go?

1936
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:14,740
Why would they random monkeys?

1937
01:11:19,660 --> 01:11:20,940
Oh, God.

1938
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:24,040
Hi, Dr. Nick.

1939
01:11:30,650 --> 01:11:31,290
Alright.

1940
01:11:31,610 --> 01:11:34,490
Maybe stop killing the monkeys or the people?

1941
01:11:34,830 --> 01:11:35,570
Question mark.

1942
01:11:38,490 --> 01:11:39,130
Alright.

1943
01:11:39,270 --> 01:11:39,590
Oh, nice.

1944
01:11:39,690 --> 01:11:40,330
There's more bees.

1945
01:11:41,370 --> 01:11:42,410
I hate that.

1946
01:11:42,590 --> 01:11:43,330
They're so hard.

1947
01:11:43,830 --> 01:11:45,490
Let me kick you!

1948
01:11:46,290 --> 01:11:47,310
It's not fair!

1949
01:11:47,310 --> 01:11:49,130
You have a force field!

1950
01:11:49,590 --> 01:11:50,150
There you go.

1951
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:55,360
I have no fear.

1952
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:56,480
We got stories for years.

1953
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:58,420
Like, Marsh becomes a robot.

1954
01:11:58,560 --> 01:11:59,660
Maybe Moe gets a cell phone.

1955
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:01,120
How about crazy wedding?

1956
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:02,040
Have no fear.

1957
01:12:02,180 --> 01:12:03,800
We got stories for years!

1958
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:05,860
Thank you for the super chat, Zara.

1959
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:06,200
Thank you.

1960
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:06,680
Thank you.

1961
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:07,300
Oh, yeah.

1962
01:12:07,420 --> 01:12:08,240
A little bonus.

1963
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:10,020
Dr. Hibbert...

1964
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:15,200
Um, they added more, like, character development on Dr. Hibbert.

1965
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:18,780
And, like, him and his wife have an absolutely terrible marriage.

1966
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:20,700
And his wife is cheating on him.

1967
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:22,740
So, like, that's, like...

1968
01:12:22,740 --> 01:12:24,460
And then, like, they always, like...

1969
01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:26,600
Almost, like, every episode or so...

1970
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:28,500
Like, every two or three episodes or so...

1971
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:31,140
They do, like, a little storyline where, like...

1972
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:32,080
His wife hate...

1973
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:34,020
Like, is, like, unsatisfied with his...

1974
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:34,640
With their marriage.

1975
01:12:36,380 --> 01:12:36,840
Yeah.

1976
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:38,380
It's, like, extra stuff.

1977
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:39,260
Like...

1978
01:12:39,260 --> 01:12:41,020
And then they did, like...

1979
01:12:41,020 --> 01:12:44,200
They did an episode parody of...

1980
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:46,140
Oh, what's that show about the island?

1981
01:12:46,220 --> 01:12:47,560
I didn't watch this show before.

1982
01:12:47,820 --> 01:12:49,920
But there's, like, this new show on...

1983
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:50,840
I think it's on HBO.

1984
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:54,120
About, like, an island resort where, like...

1985
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:54,780
People go...

1986
01:12:54,780 --> 01:12:56,400
Like, rich people go there for vacation.

1987
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:58,960
And the Simpsons did a parody of it.

1988
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:02,340
I don't remember what show it was called.

1989
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:04,360
No, no.

1990
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:05,160
Like, Lotus!

1991
01:13:05,420 --> 01:13:06,800
Yes, they did a Lotus parody.

1992
01:13:07,060 --> 01:13:07,400
Yeah.

1993
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:09,240
My giant gut is...

1994
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:10,520
Is slowing me down.

1995
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:14,460
And then Sideshow Bob got married for the seventh time.

1996
01:13:14,740 --> 01:13:16,580
And he got married to, like, some...

1997
01:13:16,580 --> 01:13:18,140
Some millionaire or some shit.

1998
01:13:18,380 --> 01:13:18,940
In that show.

1999
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:21,000
I don't know if they're, like, still together.

2000
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:21,960
Because she...

2001
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:24,120
He, like, actually was, like, in love with her.

2002
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:33,580
Alright, let's see.

2003
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:37,440
Yeah, he got married.

2004
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:38,800
He got married to a millionaire.

2005
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:41,760
Wait, Sideshow Bob has kids?

2006
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:42,360
Oh, my God.

2007
01:13:42,380 --> 01:13:43,360
I forgot about that.

2008
01:13:43,540 --> 01:13:44,120
I know.

2009
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:45,300
Thanks.

2010
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:47,560
There's so many things.

2011
01:13:47,580 --> 01:13:49,160
I forgot he had kids.

2012
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:53,380
I know I should be using my car for this.

2013
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:55,520
But, like, I'm trying to find money right now.

2014
01:13:55,740 --> 01:13:57,530
I spent all my cash on...

2015
01:13:58,780 --> 01:13:59,980
To be American.

2016
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:02,000
Alright, let me...

2017
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:02,660
Oh, my God.

2018
01:14:03,140 --> 01:14:04,380
There has to be more.

2019
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:05,500
I'm gonna steal your car.

2020
01:14:08,860 --> 01:14:09,640
Let's see.

2021
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:11,920
There has...

2022
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:13,480
Oh, this song is so groovy.

2023
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:14,180
Yeah.

2024
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:16,200
Oh, wait.

2025
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:17,180
That has to be...

2026
01:14:17,180 --> 01:14:19,140
That has to be money right there.

2027
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:20,220
I see a coin path.

2028
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:24,360
I see a path of coins.

2029
01:14:24,940 --> 01:14:26,180
I am, like...

2030
01:14:26,180 --> 01:14:29,340
I'm, like, a bunch of rats following some coins.

2031
01:14:30,020 --> 01:14:31,640
Following treasure right now.

2032
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:32,300
Okay.

2033
01:14:32,660 --> 01:14:33,120
Buddy.

2034
01:14:33,940 --> 01:14:34,300
Okay.

2035
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:34,560
Oh, wait.

2036
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:35,320
There's one over here.

2037
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:35,600
Okay.

2038
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:37,220
I need this car to come back.

2039
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:38,600
It's time for parkour.

2040
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:41,900
It's time for some funky Indian music.

2041
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:45,320
Now, go here first.

2042
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:48,200
Nice.

2043
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:49,420
I knew it.

2044
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:52,100
I knew you had something for me.

2045
01:14:52,340 --> 01:14:54,040
I knew you were holding out.

2046
01:14:54,820 --> 01:14:55,220
Okay.

2047
01:14:55,260 --> 01:14:55,460
Nice.

2048
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:56,080
We're at 400.

2049
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:57,440
We need 100 more.

2050
01:14:57,740 --> 01:14:59,520
It's just 500 coins, right?

2051
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:00,900
God.

2052
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:02,680
I can't believe...

2053
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:03,020
Why?

2054
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:06,080
Why did you guys make me become American?

2055
01:15:08,580 --> 01:15:10,520
At this time?

2056
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:12,720
In 2025?

2057
01:15:13,620 --> 01:15:14,160
Why?

2058
01:15:16,690 --> 01:15:19,400
Why did I become American in 2025?

2059
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:21,740
I saw...

2060
01:15:21,740 --> 01:15:24,420
I saw how much you gotta pay for merch now.

2061
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:25,780
I'm scared.

2062
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:26,780
I...

2063
01:15:26,780 --> 01:15:29,340
In this economy...

2064
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:32,960
In this economy...

2065
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:34,300
So real.

2066
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:39,260
Okay.

2067
01:15:43,210 --> 01:15:44,890
My giant gut is...

2068
01:15:44,890 --> 01:15:45,230
Alright.

2069
01:15:45,450 --> 01:15:46,250
It's slowing me down.

2070
01:15:46,950 --> 01:15:47,890
Oh, no.

2071
01:15:48,890 --> 01:15:50,010
I heard that...

2072
01:15:50,010 --> 01:15:50,870
You know what's good now?

2073
01:15:51,050 --> 01:15:51,990
Okay, it's not great.

2074
01:15:53,110 --> 01:15:54,570
But I heard like...

2075
01:15:54,570 --> 01:15:55,010
Okay.

2076
01:15:55,490 --> 01:15:55,790
Okay.

2077
01:15:56,230 --> 01:15:57,190
The bad thing.

2078
01:15:57,310 --> 01:15:58,090
I heard like...

2079
01:15:58,090 --> 01:15:59,390
One of my friends was like...

2080
01:15:59,390 --> 01:16:00,990
Really sad about...

2081
01:16:00,990 --> 01:16:01,990
The...

2082
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:04,070
Extra money they have to pay.

2083
01:16:04,350 --> 01:16:04,730
But like...

2084
01:16:04,730 --> 01:16:05,790
They were like...

2085
01:16:05,790 --> 01:16:06,110
No!

2086
01:16:07,130 --> 01:16:09,890
Timu's not shipping to America anymore!

2087
01:16:10,950 --> 01:16:13,030
And I couldn't help but laugh at that.

2088
01:16:13,470 --> 01:16:13,530
I...

2089
01:16:13,530 --> 01:16:13,830
I...

2090
01:16:13,830 --> 01:16:15,550
I felt bad for my friend.

2091
01:16:15,970 --> 01:16:16,510
But they got...

2092
01:16:16,510 --> 01:16:17,390
They were like...

2093
01:16:17,390 --> 01:16:17,870
They're like...

2094
01:16:17,870 --> 01:16:18,750
I can't...

2095
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:20,070
No more Timu!

2096
01:16:22,530 --> 01:16:23,490
Yeah, apparently...

2097
01:16:24,370 --> 01:16:25,010
Apparently...

2098
01:16:25,010 --> 01:16:25,290
Uh...

2099
01:16:25,290 --> 01:16:26,350
Timu had to...

2100
01:16:26,350 --> 01:16:27,510
Stop...

2101
01:16:27,510 --> 01:16:28,490
Um...

2102
01:16:28,490 --> 01:16:31,190
Timu basically stopped shipping to America.

2103
01:16:32,650 --> 01:16:33,110
Like...

2104
01:16:33,910 --> 01:16:34,370
Like...

2105
01:16:34,370 --> 01:16:36,630
I can see my house from here!

2106
01:16:37,450 --> 01:16:38,990
No more Timu!

2107
01:16:39,450 --> 01:16:39,910
Um...

2108
01:16:39,910 --> 01:16:40,890
But I heard like...

2109
01:16:40,890 --> 01:16:42,370
Some places are...

2110
01:16:42,370 --> 01:16:44,590
Offering to hold your product...

2111
01:16:44,590 --> 01:16:45,370
Until like...

2112
01:16:45,370 --> 01:16:46,610
They don't have to pay as much.

2113
01:16:46,990 --> 01:16:47,510
So like...

2114
01:16:47,510 --> 01:16:49,430
At least some places are giving options.

2115
01:16:49,570 --> 01:16:49,850
You know?

2116
01:16:50,050 --> 01:16:51,310
You might have to wait like...

2117
01:16:51,310 --> 01:16:51,850
You know...

2118
01:16:51,850 --> 01:16:53,730
A year or so to get it.

2119
01:16:53,830 --> 01:16:54,710
But at least you have...

2120
01:16:54,710 --> 01:16:55,930
You get to still have it.

2121
01:16:57,410 --> 01:16:58,410
But I heard like...

2122
01:16:58,410 --> 01:16:59,870
That's what some places are offering.

2123
01:17:00,810 --> 01:17:01,770
Yeah, holding warehouse.

2124
01:17:01,970 --> 01:17:02,330
Yeah, yeah.

2125
01:17:03,210 --> 01:17:05,210
How would I shop like a...

2126
01:17:05,210 --> 01:17:06,970
How would I shop like...

2127
01:17:06,970 --> 01:17:08,470
My pavilion there now?

2128
01:17:09,890 --> 01:17:11,590
Oh yeah, my American hat.

2129
01:17:11,670 --> 01:17:12,430
Oh yeah, back here.

2130
01:17:13,550 --> 01:17:14,710
Oh, it like...

2131
01:17:14,710 --> 01:17:15,570
Circled me back here.

2132
01:17:15,690 --> 01:17:16,030
Nice.

2133
01:17:16,850 --> 01:17:18,110
Oh, there must be...

2134
01:17:21,830 --> 01:17:24,230
The plushies are delayed, Doki.

2135
01:17:24,490 --> 01:17:26,430
The plushies are delayed!

2136
01:17:26,430 --> 01:17:26,710
Hey!

2137
01:17:28,870 --> 01:17:29,430
No!

2138
01:17:31,930 --> 01:17:33,010
Oh my god.

2139
01:17:33,010 --> 01:17:34,870
I hate this fucking bee!

2140
01:17:35,890 --> 01:17:36,450
Okay.

2141
01:17:36,810 --> 01:17:37,090
Nice.

2142
01:17:37,910 --> 01:17:38,250
Alright.

2143
01:17:38,390 --> 01:17:40,150
I'm almost close to 500.

2144
01:17:41,630 --> 01:17:42,810
Thank you for the super chat.

2145
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:43,130
Thank you.

2146
01:17:43,370 --> 01:17:43,730
No!

2147
01:17:45,630 --> 01:17:47,490
I'm feeling sorry for you guys.

2148
01:17:47,690 --> 01:17:48,570
I really do.

2149
01:17:51,810 --> 01:17:53,410
You just did it once.

2150
01:17:53,770 --> 01:17:54,070
Oh.

2151
01:17:54,370 --> 01:17:55,410
Oh, I guess like...

2152
01:17:55,410 --> 01:17:55,970
Taking care.

2153
01:17:55,970 --> 01:17:57,370
I was gonna say...

2154
01:17:57,370 --> 01:17:59,170
I was gonna say a poo.

2155
01:17:59,350 --> 01:18:02,630
It was one time that she got pregnant.

2156
01:18:03,090 --> 01:18:04,310
Not eight times.

2157
01:18:04,310 --> 01:18:05,890
What do you mean stamina?

2158
01:18:06,370 --> 01:18:07,790
But then I realized...

2159
01:18:07,790 --> 01:18:09,070
Oh yeah, like...

2160
01:18:09,070 --> 01:18:10,450
Taking care of children does...

2161
01:18:12,490 --> 01:18:14,070
Does stress out a lot.

2162
01:18:14,430 --> 01:18:14,670
Oh!

2163
01:18:15,170 --> 01:18:15,870
Monorail!

2164
01:18:17,270 --> 01:18:17,970
Monorail!

2165
01:18:19,450 --> 01:18:20,150
Monorail!

2166
01:18:24,310 --> 01:18:25,350
All right, nice.

2167
01:18:28,250 --> 01:18:29,990
I wanna sing that for karaoke.

2168
01:18:30,450 --> 01:18:31,350
I wanna sing that for...

2169
01:18:31,350 --> 01:18:33,890
If I ever get into a concert, I don't know when I'll ever...

2170
01:18:34,790 --> 01:18:35,150
Um...

2171
01:18:35,150 --> 01:18:35,910
I think like...

2172
01:18:35,910 --> 01:18:39,770
I wish I was a better singer so I can have more opportunities to sing.

2173
01:18:40,410 --> 01:18:41,170
Like actual...

2174
01:18:41,170 --> 01:18:42,170
Like, you know, like...

2175
01:18:42,170 --> 01:18:42,770
Um...

2176
01:18:42,770 --> 01:18:44,610
Opportunity slash offers to sing.

2177
01:18:45,190 --> 01:18:45,810
Like, does it...

2178
01:18:45,810 --> 01:18:48,750
That's like the one thing I wish I was good at.

2179
01:18:48,910 --> 01:18:49,990
Which is singing.

2180
01:18:50,530 --> 01:18:51,790
So that I could do like...

2181
01:18:51,790 --> 01:18:52,370
Uh...

2182
01:18:52,370 --> 01:18:53,830
Chip post songs for concerts.

2183
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:55,730
Because I would definitely...

2184
01:18:55,730 --> 01:18:58,350
I would definitely sing Monorail for a concert.

2185
01:19:02,110 --> 01:19:02,790
Like...

2186
01:19:02,790 --> 01:19:03,450
Like a...

2187
01:19:03,450 --> 01:19:04,930
A fucking idol concert.

2188
01:19:04,930 --> 01:19:05,890
I'd be like...

2189
01:19:05,890 --> 01:19:06,510
Who's that?

2190
01:19:08,330 --> 01:19:09,010
Monorail!

2191
01:19:10,310 --> 01:19:10,990
Monorail!

2192
01:19:13,350 --> 01:19:15,150
But stopping you.

2193
01:19:15,530 --> 01:19:16,090
You know...

2194
01:19:16,090 --> 01:19:16,430
Money.

2195
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:18,710
Concerts are...

2196
01:19:18,710 --> 01:19:19,990
Also like...

2197
01:19:19,990 --> 01:19:20,330
Um...

2198
01:19:20,330 --> 01:19:21,770
That's the reason why people would go...

2199
01:19:21,770 --> 01:19:22,850
Use like...

2200
01:19:22,850 --> 01:19:24,570
Outside organizers for it.

2201
01:19:26,090 --> 01:19:26,630
Um...

2202
01:19:26,630 --> 01:19:27,350
Cause like...

2203
01:19:27,350 --> 01:19:28,530
Organizing concerts.

2204
01:19:28,790 --> 01:19:29,750
And like booking venues.

2205
01:19:29,990 --> 01:19:31,130
And getting rights to song.

2206
01:19:31,470 --> 01:19:32,310
It's a lot of...

2207
01:19:32,310 --> 01:19:32,990
Time.

2208
01:19:33,270 --> 01:19:33,630
Money.

2209
01:19:34,210 --> 01:19:35,130
And like...

2210
01:19:35,750 --> 01:19:36,790
Effort and stuff.

2211
01:19:36,970 --> 01:19:38,250
So I can't do that on my own.

2212
01:19:38,810 --> 01:19:39,090
Alright.

2213
01:19:39,150 --> 01:19:39,350
Nice.

2214
01:19:39,450 --> 01:19:39,930
We have $500.

2215
01:19:40,550 --> 01:19:41,350
Where is Homer?

2216
01:19:42,090 --> 01:19:43,850
I don't know where Homer is.

2217
01:19:44,190 --> 01:19:44,610
Hahaha.

2218
01:19:49,270 --> 01:19:49,810
Alright.

2219
01:19:50,010 --> 01:19:51,090
Have you been practicing singing?

2220
01:19:51,330 --> 01:19:51,610
No.

2221
01:19:52,390 --> 01:19:54,550
My throat has not been the greatest...

2222
01:19:54,550 --> 01:19:56,730
The last couple of months.

2223
01:19:57,010 --> 01:19:58,590
So I really haven't had it...

2224
01:19:58,590 --> 01:19:59,810
I don't know where Homer is.

2225
01:19:59,990 --> 01:20:01,030
Like I...

2226
01:20:01,030 --> 01:20:01,530
I...

2227
01:20:01,530 --> 01:20:02,350
There's no...

2228
01:20:02,350 --> 01:20:03,510
Why is there no...

2229
01:20:03,510 --> 01:20:04,570
Where is he?

2230
01:20:04,950 --> 01:20:05,470
Hahaha.

2231
01:20:06,430 --> 01:20:07,450
Where's the hospital?

2232
01:20:07,470 --> 01:20:08,630
I don't remember...

2233
01:20:08,630 --> 01:20:09,230
Oh, it's this way.

2234
01:20:09,330 --> 01:20:10,070
I remember now.

2235
01:20:10,530 --> 01:20:11,130
Don't worry.

2236
01:20:11,210 --> 01:20:11,970
I remember now.

2237
01:20:12,770 --> 01:20:14,190
See, I remember traffic.

2238
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:16,350
That's the hospital, right?

2239
01:20:17,270 --> 01:20:17,790
No.

2240
01:20:17,970 --> 01:20:18,750
That's not the hospital.

2241
01:20:18,910 --> 01:20:19,030
Wait.

2242
01:20:19,150 --> 01:20:19,510
Where is...

2243
01:20:19,510 --> 01:20:20,350
Oh, that's the hospital.

2244
01:20:20,350 --> 01:20:20,850
There's Homer.

2245
01:20:20,970 --> 01:20:21,390
I see him.

2246
01:20:21,870 --> 01:20:21,950
Wait.

2247
01:20:22,010 --> 01:20:22,590
Where is Homer?

2248
01:20:23,010 --> 01:20:23,450
Wait, no.

2249
01:20:23,510 --> 01:20:24,130
That's the museum.

2250
01:20:24,410 --> 01:20:25,570
Where the fuck is the hospital?

2251
01:20:25,650 --> 01:20:26,690
Oh, there's the hospital, guys.

2252
01:20:26,950 --> 01:20:27,970
I figured it out.

2253
01:20:28,070 --> 01:20:28,790
There's the hospital.

2254
01:20:29,290 --> 01:20:29,650
Uh...

2255
01:20:30,430 --> 01:20:30,830
Sorry.

2256
01:20:31,030 --> 01:20:34,390
I went through like seven different loops of where the hospital was.

2257
01:20:34,730 --> 01:20:35,650
See, I told you.

2258
01:20:35,650 --> 01:20:36,870
I remember where it is.

2259
01:20:39,210 --> 01:20:40,010
Um, but...

2260
01:20:40,010 --> 01:20:44,110
My throat hasn't been the greatest, so I haven't had a chance to even practice singing at all in any way.

2261
01:20:45,630 --> 01:20:46,030
Um...

2262
01:20:46,030 --> 01:20:46,770
Because...

2263
01:20:46,770 --> 01:20:47,110
Oh, wait.

2264
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:48,430
Isn't that Homer's brother?

2265
01:20:49,090 --> 01:20:50,070
Oh, my God.

2266
01:20:50,070 --> 01:20:51,570
What's wrong with the motto?

2267
01:20:51,710 --> 01:20:53,770
Like, they'll never see the inside of the car.

2268
01:20:54,330 --> 01:20:55,410
Mr. Homer, sir.

2269
01:20:55,870 --> 01:20:58,490
Do you have an oversized vehicle that I might be borrowing?

2270
01:20:58,970 --> 01:20:59,490
Borrowing?

2271
01:20:59,690 --> 01:20:59,810
No.

2272
01:21:00,370 --> 01:21:02,290
Selling to you at an insanely high price?

2273
01:21:02,490 --> 01:21:02,710
Yes.

2274
01:21:03,050 --> 01:21:03,350
Fine.

2275
01:21:03,570 --> 01:21:03,770
Whatever.

2276
01:21:04,790 --> 01:21:05,570
It's fine.

2277
01:21:05,570 --> 01:21:07,110
I'll just keep selling.

2278
01:21:07,370 --> 01:21:08,330
Oh, my God.

2279
01:21:08,470 --> 01:21:09,630
Is this car?

2280
01:21:09,870 --> 01:21:13,810
Oh, the car that bankrupted his brother's company.

2281
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:20,560
The Homer.

2282
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:24,540
How much did it take to build this?

2283
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:26,040
I'm broke.

2284
01:21:26,620 --> 01:21:27,060
Oh, no.

2285
01:21:27,180 --> 01:21:27,840
I actually tabbed out.

2286
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:29,040
That's not what I wanted to do.

2287
01:21:29,180 --> 01:21:29,340
Okay.

2288
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:30,820
I need to save my game after this.

2289
01:21:32,380 --> 01:21:32,680
Okay.

2290
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:33,620
It is too much.

2291
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:36,960
Hit the Shelby build van and collect the diapers before time runs out.

2292
01:21:38,340 --> 01:21:38,740
Okay.

2293
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:39,900
Let me...

2294
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:40,400
Oh, fuck.

2295
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:40,780
I can't.

2296
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:41,760
Okay.

2297
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:42,220
It's fine.

2298
01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:43,560
All right.

2299
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:45,560
Before I go...

2300
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:45,700
Okay.

2301
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:46,640
I should...

2302
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:47,000
All right.

2303
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:47,580
Where is it?

2304
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:50,080
All right.

2305
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:52,420
We got to hit the van and collect...

2306
01:21:52,420 --> 01:21:55,260
Oh, this better have good RAM material, Homer.

2307
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:57,820
You did bankrupt your brother's company.

2308
01:22:00,100 --> 01:22:00,920
Oh, my God.

2309
01:22:01,020 --> 01:22:01,100
Wait.

2310
01:22:01,180 --> 01:22:02,400
How many kids are in there?

2311
01:22:04,180 --> 01:22:05,260
Oh, my God.

2312
01:22:05,580 --> 01:22:06,620
That's a lot of children.

2313
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:08,200
Okay.

2314
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:09,620
I need to hit it 10 more times.

2315
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:11,040
That's fine.

2316
01:22:13,940 --> 01:22:14,460
Nice.

2317
01:22:15,660 --> 01:22:16,080
Nine.

2318
01:22:16,220 --> 01:22:17,000
Oh, yeah.

2319
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:20,120
They were more popular than me because they had one more kid.

2320
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:22,720
They were like, oh, my God.

2321
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,040
Congratulations, Appu.

2322
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:25,560
For having eight children.

2323
01:22:25,820 --> 01:22:28,540
And then right after, this bitch had nine.

2324
01:22:30,980 --> 01:22:33,140
I bet it was not even natural.

2325
01:22:33,140 --> 01:22:34,120
Like, my wife.

2326
01:22:34,980 --> 01:22:35,580
My wife.

2327
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:35,960
Oh, yeah.

2328
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:36,980
For those who don't know.

2329
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:42,620
Like, it's very hard to naturally have eight children.

2330
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:43,620
Usually, it's like...

2331
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:46,120
Like, it's like...

2332
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:46,600
What was it?

2333
01:22:47,060 --> 01:22:48,500
They do it, like...

2334
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:49,440
Science-wise.

2335
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:52,080
I don't even know what it's called.

2336
01:22:52,340 --> 01:22:55,580
Like, they have to artificially have that happen.

2337
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:01,860
Yeah, it's not actually natural.

2338
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:03,620
I mean, like...

2339
01:23:03,620 --> 01:23:04,980
How could that be natural?

2340
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:07,180
Where is my other car?

2341
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:08,760
Dude, where's my...

2342
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:09,880
I swear to...

2343
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:10,740
Oh, my God.

2344
01:23:10,740 --> 01:23:11,080
Please.

2345
01:23:11,780 --> 01:23:12,680
Please drop it.

2346
01:23:13,580 --> 01:23:14,340
Oh, my God.

2347
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:15,800
You have to be kidding me.

2348
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:17,640
Let me take that.

2349
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:18,400
Oh, my God.

2350
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:18,860
Thank God.

2351
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:19,440
Okay.

2352
01:23:20,060 --> 01:23:20,340
Okay.

2353
01:23:20,460 --> 01:23:21,180
I was going to freak out.

2354
01:23:21,260 --> 01:23:22,260
I was actually going to freak out.

2355
01:23:22,540 --> 01:23:22,940
I...

2356
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:25,820
He was going to block me from getting it.

2357
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:28,020
I was going to freak the fuck out.

2358
01:23:28,660 --> 01:23:29,060
I...

2359
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:36,060
She actually blocked me.

2360
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:47,120
I told you I didn't crash out.

2361
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:47,980
I swear to God.

2362
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:51,600
If she actually, like, blocked me from getting that fucking...

2363
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:53,220
From getting the...

2364
01:23:53,820 --> 01:23:55,340
The diaper, it was over.

2365
01:23:56,020 --> 01:23:56,880
It was...

2366
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:57,460
It was over.

2367
01:23:57,640 --> 01:23:57,980
Okay.

2368
01:23:58,100 --> 01:23:58,460
Oh, wait.

2369
01:23:58,500 --> 01:23:59,560
I want his car.

2370
01:24:00,220 --> 01:24:02,720
Usually, they give you extra cars if you do their missions.

2371
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:05,480
Excuse me, nice Mr. Shopkeeper person.

2372
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:08,180
Have you seen a hovering death machine?

2373
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:11,320
No, nothing specifically of the hovering kind.

2374
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:11,700
Oh, yeah.

2375
01:24:11,740 --> 01:24:12,480
I forgot to say.

2376
01:24:13,160 --> 01:24:16,860
This was to be my greatest invention since sideburns in a can.

2377
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:18,880
They make you handsome and lovely.

2378
01:24:19,100 --> 01:24:19,920
What are you talking about?

2379
01:24:20,140 --> 01:24:21,680
I call it the hover car.

2380
01:24:21,940 --> 01:24:22,280
TM.

2381
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:23,720
Don't try to steal the names.

2382
01:24:23,820 --> 01:24:24,760
The hover car.

2383
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:26,480
I installed the onboard computer.

2384
01:24:26,660 --> 01:24:28,740
And it came alive and attacked my person.

2385
01:24:29,020 --> 01:24:31,760
For the love of all that's gliding, you gotta help me here.

2386
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,380
Okay, what on earth can I do?

2387
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:35,780
Knock the flesh rigging the thing off the road.

2388
01:24:36,060 --> 01:24:38,460
Before the authorities come and take me away again.

2389
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:42,160
Prisons ain't kind to pencil neck geeks like myself.

2390
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:42,600
They...

2391
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:43,860
They stomp and they kick.

2392
01:24:44,220 --> 01:24:44,960
Oh, no.

2393
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:45,700
Okay.

2394
01:24:45,700 --> 01:24:48,640
Find and disable the hover car before time runs out.

2395
01:24:48,780 --> 01:24:49,780
Alright, I'll...

2396
01:24:51,460 --> 01:24:53,300
I'll cancel this mission.

2397
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:55,320
And then...

2398
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:56,240
And then...

2399
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:56,740
I'll...

2400
01:24:56,740 --> 01:24:57,600
Save game.

2401
01:24:57,720 --> 01:24:58,100
There you go.

2402
01:24:58,380 --> 01:24:58,660
Nice.

2403
01:25:01,780 --> 01:25:02,660
Alright, nice.

2404
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:03,040
Alright.

2405
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:05,600
Good.

2406
01:25:06,140 --> 01:25:07,000
Alright, I'm ready.

2407
01:25:07,260 --> 01:25:08,440
I'm ready, nerd.

2408
01:25:10,740 --> 01:25:13,100
Alright, we have find and disable this car.

2409
01:25:13,100 --> 01:25:13,880
I left this door.

2410
01:25:14,020 --> 01:25:16,500
Hoodlums put pornography in the bridal magazine.

2411
01:25:16,780 --> 01:25:17,480
Oh my god.

2412
01:25:17,620 --> 01:25:18,160
What the fuck?

2413
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:18,820
What?

2414
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:21,360
Wait.

2415
01:25:21,980 --> 01:25:23,540
Okay, someone was like, you should...

2416
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:26,140
Wait, it's invisible?

2417
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:29,620
Oh my god.

2418
01:25:29,960 --> 01:25:31,580
What kind of car is that?

2419
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:39,380
This is bad.

2420
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:41,200
Guys, I think it's over.

2421
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:43,800
I can't even make it over.

2422
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:46,340
He's...

2423
01:25:46,340 --> 01:25:47,900
It's such a fast car.

2424
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:49,440
Wait, is this gonna be my car?

2425
01:25:49,660 --> 01:25:50,400
Oh my god.

2426
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:52,020
It's gonna be my car if I do it correctly.

2427
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:53,240
I...

2428
01:25:53,240 --> 01:25:54,020
Oh my god.

2429
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:54,460
I...

2430
01:25:54,460 --> 01:25:55,980
This car...

2431
01:25:57,840 --> 01:25:58,960
Oh my god.

2432
01:25:59,100 --> 01:26:00,540
Now that's a car.

2433
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:02,000
Ba-bum-bum.

2434
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:02,880
Ha-ha-ha.

2435
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:04,220
Sorry.

2436
01:26:06,260 --> 01:26:07,820
Are you fucking...

2437
01:26:07,820 --> 01:26:08,300
Oh!

2438
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:10,700
I can't.

2439
01:26:10,860 --> 01:26:11,520
We got...

2440
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:14,900
This car will destroy itself before I destroy it.

2441
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:16,160
Like, at this point.

2442
01:26:16,380 --> 01:26:20,160
At this point, this car will destroy itself before I can make it to it.

2443
01:26:21,740 --> 01:26:23,820
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

2444
01:26:23,820 --> 01:26:24,660
Oh, okay.

2445
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:26,100
Um...

2446
01:26:26,100 --> 01:26:26,580
Um...

2447
01:26:26,580 --> 01:26:27,680
I think it's over, guys.

2448
01:26:27,860 --> 01:26:28,980
I don't know where I am.

2449
01:26:29,180 --> 01:26:30,540
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

2450
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:32,620
Where am I?

2451
01:26:33,180 --> 01:26:34,520
Where is this car?

2452
01:26:35,140 --> 01:26:36,580
Destroy yourself now.

2453
01:26:36,720 --> 01:26:37,560
The car.

2454
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:38,500
Please.

2455
01:26:40,260 --> 01:26:41,400
Where is it?

2456
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:44,880
Oh, no.

2457
01:26:46,860 --> 01:26:48,740
Maybe it'll destroy itself, guys.

2458
01:26:48,900 --> 01:26:49,660
I have hope.

2459
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:51,700
I have hope.

2460
01:26:52,020 --> 01:26:53,760
We'll see the car suddenly.

2461
01:26:54,140 --> 01:26:55,300
Just go up.

2462
01:26:57,060 --> 01:27:00,780
Oh my... I think it's... Oh wait, it was... Oh, it's waiting for me.

2463
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:01,840
Guys, do you see that?

2464
01:27:02,180 --> 01:27:04,000
It's been waiting for me.

2465
01:27:04,180 --> 01:27:12,500
Actually, the car was... The car was waiting for me this entire time.

2466
01:27:12,980 --> 01:27:14,980
I am having so much fun.

2467
01:27:14,980 --> 01:27:17,620
It's trying so hard to, like, help me.

2468
01:27:18,260 --> 01:27:19,420
I can't.

2469
01:27:21,260 --> 01:27:23,340
It was... How kind.

2470
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:26,340
How kind of it.

2471
01:27:27,860 --> 01:27:28,500
Okay.

2472
01:27:29,580 --> 01:27:30,620
Oh my god, this is good.

2473
01:27:31,780 --> 01:27:33,060
Either you or I.

2474
01:27:36,260 --> 01:27:37,160
This is good.

2475
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:42,240
No, why did I let him get out?

2476
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:46,940
No, why did I let him get out?

2477
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:50,260
Oh my god.

2478
01:27:51,100 --> 01:27:51,680
Why?

2479
01:27:52,180 --> 01:27:54,000
I was so confident.

2480
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:57,220
Oh my god, we did it!

2481
01:27:59,140 --> 01:27:59,780
Okay.

2482
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:01,620
This is okay.

2483
01:28:03,940 --> 01:28:05,560
This is not okay, guys.

2484
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:08,580
Because, like, my car is not doing so well.

2485
01:28:08,580 --> 01:28:10,460
And I started... Oh wait.

2486
01:28:10,700 --> 01:28:11,540
Wait, there's a wrench.

2487
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:12,420
Woo!

2488
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:16,000
Never punish, baby!

2489
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:18,100
Oh wait, where is Professor Frank?

2490
01:28:18,380 --> 01:28:20,060
Oh, it's so far.

2491
01:28:20,340 --> 01:28:22,820
I forgot how far he is.

2492
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:26,980
He might be really far, guys.

2493
01:28:26,980 --> 01:28:28,860
I'm scared and disorientated.

2494
01:28:29,340 --> 01:28:30,000
Me too.

2495
01:28:33,340 --> 01:28:34,180
Oh no.

2496
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:37,080
Oh no.

2497
01:28:37,420 --> 01:28:38,580
Oh, there is, there is, there is.

2498
01:28:38,900 --> 01:28:39,940
Oh, thank god!

2499
01:28:40,180 --> 01:28:41,220
We just made it!

2500
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:42,620
Give me that car!

2501
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:45,040
Great work, my Hindu friend!

2502
01:28:45,780 --> 01:28:47,260
Not... Never punish, guys!

2503
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:48,380
Never punished!

2504
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:52,380
Look, if you need a ride, instant message my Cortex.

2505
01:28:52,540 --> 01:28:54,640
By which I mean, call me!

2506
01:28:55,960 --> 01:28:57,140
Oh my god, nice!

2507
01:28:57,360 --> 01:28:58,840
I got the hover car!

2508
01:28:58,920 --> 01:29:00,060
See, I told you!

2509
01:29:00,180 --> 01:29:01,140
I told you!

2510
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:04,020
Everything, everything goes for Doki.

2511
01:29:04,660 --> 01:29:05,780
Alright, let's steal that car.

2512
01:29:06,020 --> 01:29:06,920
That was a cool car.

2513
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:09,440
Wait, that's not the hover car!

2514
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:11,860
Wait.

2515
01:29:14,140 --> 01:29:15,140
Alright, toughness.

2516
01:29:15,140 --> 01:29:18,400
Oh, but this acceleration is really fast.

2517
01:29:21,160 --> 01:29:22,800
Wait, how fast is the...

2518
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:24,420
How fast is...

2519
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:26,020
Oh my god, there's so many cars.

2520
01:29:26,340 --> 01:29:28,060
How fast is this car?

2521
01:29:28,180 --> 01:29:29,200
Wait, this car is better.

2522
01:29:30,020 --> 01:29:33,240
Wait, the car built for Homer is so much better than every...

2523
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:34,600
How did it go out of business?

2524
01:29:36,780 --> 01:29:38,240
This car is so fast!

2525
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:40,240
How did this car go out of business?

2526
01:29:41,820 --> 01:29:43,020
Look, and it has this.

2527
01:29:45,580 --> 01:29:47,160
Mean Windaloo Machine!

2528
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:50,100
Ironically, it looks...

2529
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:50,880
Too...

2530
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:51,300
You're right.

2531
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:52,420
It was too ahead of its...

2532
01:29:52,420 --> 01:29:53,720
I'd buy this car.

2533
01:29:54,280 --> 01:29:56,620
It was just too ahead of its time, guys.

2534
01:29:57,300 --> 01:29:57,860
Woo!

2535
01:29:58,280 --> 01:29:59,900
Oh, I went the wrong way.

2536
01:30:04,430 --> 01:30:06,310
What in the hell were you thinking?

2537
01:30:06,990 --> 01:30:09,090
Alright, $82,000 in...

2538
01:30:09,870 --> 01:30:11,150
Okay, but like...

2539
01:30:11,150 --> 01:30:12,310
But like...

2540
01:30:12,310 --> 01:30:14,530
This could be like a Ferrari, you know?

2541
01:30:17,730 --> 01:30:18,690
Alright, hello.

2542
01:30:19,390 --> 01:30:20,610
Hello, Christy.

2543
01:30:20,810 --> 01:30:22,410
Hello, famous American clown.

2544
01:30:22,930 --> 01:30:23,890
I wish to ask a favor.

2545
01:30:24,150 --> 01:30:26,230
Yeah, I mean, it's like...

2546
01:30:26,230 --> 01:30:27,010
It's this...

2547
01:30:27,010 --> 01:30:28,390
This time's Ferrari.

2548
01:30:29,210 --> 01:30:31,190
If someone was willing to buy...

2549
01:30:31,190 --> 01:30:34,890
The armored car, someone will buy this car.

2550
01:30:35,090 --> 01:30:36,910
I'm a drink, squeezy, punchy lowlife.

2551
01:30:37,070 --> 01:30:39,070
You need a professional scumbag.

2552
01:30:39,270 --> 01:30:41,170
Follow a cop until you find one.

2553
01:30:41,170 --> 01:30:43,590
You'll have better luck if you...

2554
01:30:43,590 --> 01:30:44,230
You know...

2555
01:30:44,230 --> 01:30:47,570
Yeah, if people buy the Cybertruck, people will buy this.

2556
01:30:51,050 --> 01:30:51,610
Alright.

2557
01:30:52,190 --> 01:30:52,970
This little...

2558
01:30:52,970 --> 01:30:54,610
Follow up for police to find the criminal.

2559
01:30:55,290 --> 01:30:57,070
You're into your criminal.

2560
01:30:57,350 --> 01:30:57,450
Okay.

2561
01:31:02,630 --> 01:31:04,430
I'm sorry, I love...

2562
01:31:04,430 --> 01:31:05,650
I just...

2563
01:31:05,650 --> 01:31:06,990
I love the horn.

2564
01:31:06,990 --> 01:31:07,690
I can't help.

2565
01:31:07,770 --> 01:31:09,730
I like the simple things in life, guys.

2566
01:31:13,110 --> 01:31:14,970
And that brings me joy.

2567
01:31:15,490 --> 01:31:16,790
It really does.

2568
01:31:17,670 --> 01:31:18,310
It really does.

2569
01:31:23,570 --> 01:31:26,610
Um, excuse me, ma'am, I did hit a person.

2570
01:31:26,790 --> 01:31:27,350
Get it right.

2571
01:31:33,090 --> 01:31:37,950
Okay, how do you get this done in... uh, 19 seconds.

2572
01:31:38,790 --> 01:31:40,470
Guys, I don't think I'm gonna make it, guys.

2573
01:31:40,650 --> 01:31:41,510
I fucked up a little.

2574
01:31:42,710 --> 01:31:48,690
C, 17, 18... OH MY GOD, YOU WHY?!

2575
01:31:48,690 --> 01:31:50,090
LEADY DRIVE!

2576
01:31:53,190 --> 01:31:54,050
I got it.

2577
01:31:56,570 --> 01:31:57,230
All right.

2578
01:31:59,670 --> 01:32:00,190
Follow.

2579
01:32:01,510 --> 01:32:03,410
Jesus Christ, he's so fast.

2580
01:32:04,230 --> 01:32:06,090
The goddamn road rage.

2581
01:32:09,830 --> 01:32:10,710
Oh my god.

2582
01:32:11,110 --> 01:32:12,910
I'm following as much as I can.

2583
01:32:14,630 --> 01:32:17,110
Back down to the last donut.

2584
01:32:17,990 --> 01:32:19,670
All I'm seeing, it was not my fault.

2585
01:32:20,170 --> 01:32:21,930
She should have opened her eyes.

2586
01:32:25,190 --> 01:32:26,730
All right, get back here!

2587
01:32:30,130 --> 01:32:31,950
Get back here, Popo!

2588
01:32:31,950 --> 01:32:31,970
Oh!

2589
01:32:33,610 --> 01:32:34,170
Fuck!

2590
01:32:34,770 --> 01:32:34,790
Fuck!

2591
01:32:35,430 --> 01:32:39,090
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2592
01:32:41,110 --> 01:32:42,290
Chief Wiggum!

2593
01:32:42,930 --> 01:32:44,550
I have your son!

2594
01:32:45,730 --> 01:32:47,150
Hindu coming through.

2595
01:32:47,490 --> 01:32:49,130
It's not that difficult to get him.

2596
01:32:49,290 --> 01:32:51,130
He's very easily persuadable.

2597
01:32:52,250 --> 01:32:53,550
Don't lose it!

2598
01:32:53,650 --> 01:32:57,630
I'm trying- You think I'm fucking trying to sabotage myself?

2599
01:33:02,830 --> 01:33:04,610
No, are you fucking kidding me?

2600
01:33:04,790 --> 01:33:07,670
Are you... Jesus Christ.

2601
01:33:08,390 --> 01:33:10,350
How can you be such a good driver?

2602
01:33:11,650 --> 01:33:13,110
She's incompetent.

2603
01:33:15,190 --> 01:33:15,770
Okay.

2604
01:33:16,630 --> 01:33:17,730
Alright, nice.

2605
01:33:18,470 --> 01:33:22,650
I was gonna say how the fuck... What is that driving?

2606
01:33:22,930 --> 01:33:23,190
Yes.

2607
01:33:23,970 --> 01:33:27,250
Wait, I wanna go into the... I'll go to the DMV.

2608
01:33:27,670 --> 01:33:28,250
Hello.

2609
01:33:30,990 --> 01:33:31,790
Hello, ladies.

2610
01:33:32,110 --> 01:33:33,110
How are you this fine day?

2611
01:33:33,430 --> 01:33:35,490
The doctor said I should be dead years ago.

2612
01:33:38,190 --> 01:33:39,530
Greetings, loyal customer.

2613
01:33:39,870 --> 01:33:43,850
I'm more likely to be hit by a meteorite than I am to have a baby.

2614
01:33:44,190 --> 01:33:44,710
Whoa, damn.

2615
01:33:44,890 --> 01:33:45,250
That's fucked.

2616
01:33:45,910 --> 01:33:46,410
Don't worry.

2617
01:33:46,490 --> 01:33:47,390
I got you, Mo Man.

2618
01:33:49,390 --> 01:33:49,970
Don't worry.

2619
01:33:50,110 --> 01:33:50,910
That'll be $5.

2620
01:33:51,330 --> 01:33:52,070
Thank you.

2621
01:33:52,250 --> 01:33:52,770
Come again.

2622
01:33:53,870 --> 01:33:54,270
Alright.

2623
01:33:54,510 --> 01:33:54,830
Hello.

2624
01:33:55,450 --> 01:33:55,650
Hello.

2625
01:33:55,650 --> 01:33:56,750
Head over your wallet, dude.

2626
01:33:56,950 --> 01:33:58,210
This is totally a mugging.

2627
01:33:58,210 --> 01:33:58,970
What?

2628
01:33:59,050 --> 01:33:59,730
What good luck?

2629
01:34:00,130 --> 01:34:00,470
A criminal?

2630
01:34:00,970 --> 01:34:01,070
Huh?

2631
01:34:01,410 --> 01:34:06,830
Surely a violent filthbag such as yourself could find out who is driving the black cola vans.

2632
01:34:07,010 --> 01:34:11,930
Well, I do have a connection at the DMV, but it will cost you.

2633
01:34:12,170 --> 01:34:12,830
Wait, how much?

2634
01:34:13,090 --> 01:34:14,870
You have to pick up the litter from a community service.

2635
01:34:15,190 --> 01:34:15,710
Oh, okay.

2636
01:34:15,790 --> 01:34:16,250
That's fine.

2637
01:34:17,530 --> 01:34:18,930
Now hand over your wallet.

2638
01:34:19,270 --> 01:34:19,650
Wait, what?

2639
01:34:19,730 --> 01:34:20,490
Yes, yes, whatever.

2640
01:34:21,590 --> 01:34:22,410
Yes, yes.

2641
01:34:22,690 --> 01:34:25,170
We'll keep doing the same thing over and over again.

2642
01:34:25,290 --> 01:34:28,190
Hopefully my store will not be robbed more than four times while I am driving.

2643
01:34:28,190 --> 01:34:29,050
Driving around today.

2644
01:34:29,950 --> 01:34:30,510
Alright.

2645
01:34:30,770 --> 01:34:31,970
Follow the garbage truck.

2646
01:34:32,110 --> 01:34:32,210
Wait.

2647
01:34:32,330 --> 01:34:33,210
That's not how that works.

2648
01:34:33,230 --> 01:34:33,550
What?

2649
01:34:33,770 --> 01:34:35,310
It's a really bad day.

2650
01:34:36,150 --> 01:34:36,710
Alright.

2651
01:34:37,050 --> 01:34:37,330
One.

2652
01:34:38,330 --> 01:34:38,850
Wait.

2653
01:34:38,850 --> 01:34:39,670
It's just five.

2654
01:34:40,090 --> 01:34:40,650
It can't be that.

2655
01:34:40,710 --> 01:34:40,870
Wait.

2656
01:34:40,970 --> 01:34:41,050
How?

2657
01:34:41,230 --> 01:34:42,690
Four minutes to do all?

2658
01:34:42,770 --> 01:34:43,110
Okay.

2659
01:34:44,490 --> 01:34:45,970
I know there's...

2660
01:34:45,970 --> 01:34:47,430
There's something wrong.

2661
01:34:47,990 --> 01:34:48,670
What do you mean?

2662
01:34:48,850 --> 01:34:50,830
Four minutes to collect five?

2663
01:34:50,830 --> 01:34:51,070
Five?

2664
01:34:51,850 --> 01:34:52,930
Oh, there...

2665
01:34:52,930 --> 01:34:53,510
That's...

2666
01:34:53,510 --> 01:34:56,230
Oh, I know there's something more.

2667
01:34:56,250 --> 01:34:58,070
That's suspicious right there.

2668
01:34:58,310 --> 01:35:00,770
There's more to this, isn't there?

2669
01:35:01,210 --> 01:35:03,470
There's more to this.

2670
01:35:03,670 --> 01:35:05,910
This mission doesn't seem right.

2671
01:35:06,510 --> 01:35:07,670
What do you mean?

2672
01:35:07,710 --> 01:35:14,550
I got one minute to collect 21 donuts and this one was like four minutes to collect five?

2673
01:35:14,550 --> 01:35:16,010
What do you mean?

2674
01:35:16,310 --> 01:35:16,810
Wait.

2675
01:35:17,630 --> 01:35:19,630
Why did it stay at four?

2676
01:35:21,670 --> 01:35:23,250
Wait a minute.

2677
01:35:25,350 --> 01:35:26,950
Wait a minute.

2678
01:35:27,430 --> 01:35:29,350
This timer doesn't feel right.

2679
01:35:30,870 --> 01:35:31,410
Come on.

2680
01:35:31,550 --> 01:35:32,390
Drop another one.

2681
01:35:33,670 --> 01:35:34,390
Okay.

2682
01:35:35,350 --> 01:35:37,710
Collect our remaining garbage for snake?

2683
01:35:38,230 --> 01:35:39,330
Are you serious?

2684
01:35:40,050 --> 01:35:40,330
There's...

2685
01:35:40,330 --> 01:35:40,970
Oh my God.

2686
01:35:41,230 --> 01:35:41,390
Okay.

2687
01:35:41,650 --> 01:35:42,210
Okay.

2688
01:35:42,210 --> 01:35:43,110
I get it now.

2689
01:35:43,110 --> 01:35:44,190
Oh my God.

2690
01:35:44,410 --> 01:35:44,770
It's...

2691
01:35:44,770 --> 01:35:45,710
Oh my God.

2692
01:35:45,870 --> 01:35:46,310
I...

2693
01:35:47,110 --> 01:35:48,270
Oh my God.

2694
01:35:48,530 --> 01:35:48,870
Okay.

2695
01:35:49,450 --> 01:35:50,050
Okay.

2696
01:35:50,050 --> 01:35:50,770
I get it.

2697
01:35:50,910 --> 01:35:52,190
It's parkour time.

2698
01:35:53,330 --> 01:35:53,890
Okay.

2699
01:35:53,890 --> 01:35:54,850
That's fucked up.

2700
01:35:55,210 --> 01:35:56,810
That's actually fucked up.

2701
01:35:56,930 --> 01:35:57,150
Okay.

2702
01:35:57,210 --> 01:35:57,890
Now I get it.

2703
01:35:58,470 --> 01:36:00,630
Just give me a minute to catch my breath.

2704
01:36:00,790 --> 01:36:02,170
Oh my...

2705
01:36:02,170 --> 01:36:02,670
No!

2706
01:36:03,470 --> 01:36:04,070
No!

2707
01:36:05,110 --> 01:36:05,450
No!

2708
01:36:09,010 --> 01:36:09,970
I should sleep now.

2709
01:36:09,970 --> 01:36:11,990
Oh my God.

2710
01:36:12,130 --> 01:36:12,190
Oh my God.

2711
01:36:12,190 --> 01:36:12,850
The cameras!

2712
01:36:14,810 --> 01:36:16,010
The God damn...

2713
01:36:18,260 --> 01:36:19,520
Guys, it's over.

2714
01:36:21,220 --> 01:36:22,200
It's over.

2715
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:25,820
Guys, it's already over.

2716
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:28,220
It's already over, guys.

2717
01:36:28,700 --> 01:36:29,520
That was...

2718
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:30,800
That's what sealed my fate.

2719
01:36:32,160 --> 01:36:34,360
That sealed my fate, guys.

2720
01:36:36,140 --> 01:36:36,680
Yo.

2721
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:38,800
This is so fucked up.

2722
01:36:39,400 --> 01:36:41,400
This is so fucked up.

2723
01:36:41,580 --> 01:36:42,740
You're slowing me down.

2724
01:36:44,740 --> 01:36:46,560
This is worse!

2725
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:49,600
Where's...

2726
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:50,560
Where's the rest?

2727
01:36:55,640 --> 01:36:58,740
Are you fucking kidding me?

2728
01:36:58,740 --> 01:37:00,120
Just give me a minute.

2729
01:37:00,300 --> 01:37:01,200
Where's the other ones?

2730
01:37:02,220 --> 01:37:02,620
Where...

2731
01:37:03,820 --> 01:37:04,220
Where...

2732
01:37:07,620 --> 01:37:08,900
Are you fucking...

2733
01:37:08,900 --> 01:37:09,160
Okay.

2734
01:37:09,780 --> 01:37:10,380
Oh my God.

2735
01:37:10,540 --> 01:37:11,320
Oh my God.

2736
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:12,160
Are you fucking...

2737
01:37:12,160 --> 01:37:12,540
Oh my God.

2738
01:37:12,620 --> 01:37:13,240
I could've just ran through.

2739
01:37:13,420 --> 01:37:15,160
I could've...

2740
01:37:15,160 --> 01:37:17,540
I can't...

2741
01:37:17,540 --> 01:37:19,280
I should sleep more.

2742
01:37:19,540 --> 01:37:20,560
I did it!

2743
01:37:24,360 --> 01:37:25,580
My guardian shot.

2744
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:27,620
Come to papa, random object.

2745
01:37:28,340 --> 01:37:29,360
Okay, now I know though.

2746
01:37:30,020 --> 01:37:30,820
I'm flying!

2747
01:37:31,460 --> 01:37:32,140
I...

2748
01:37:32,140 --> 01:37:33,320
Okay.

2749
01:37:37,580 --> 01:37:38,440
It's fine.

2750
01:37:39,740 --> 01:37:40,640
It's fine.

2751
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:42,580
Everything is fine.

2752
01:37:43,320 --> 01:37:44,660
Everything is fine.

2753
01:37:45,540 --> 01:37:47,260
My giant god is...

2754
01:37:47,260 --> 01:37:48,220
21.

2755
01:37:48,760 --> 01:37:49,360
22.

2756
01:37:50,640 --> 01:37:51,180
23.

2757
01:37:52,420 --> 01:37:53,600
And then...

2758
01:37:54,360 --> 01:37:54,900
24.

2759
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:57,020
25!

2760
01:37:57,600 --> 01:37:58,900
Oh my God!

2761
01:37:59,060 --> 01:38:00,740
Drive to the DMV!

2762
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:01,640
Ah!

2763
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:03,480
Okay.

2764
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:05,660
Where's my...

2765
01:38:07,480 --> 01:38:08,340
Okay, there we go.

2766
01:38:08,340 --> 01:38:10,460
I will pay you a million dollars in the next life.

2767
01:38:10,580 --> 01:38:10,940
I promise.

2768
01:38:16,720 --> 01:38:17,500
I'm driving.

2769
01:38:18,200 --> 01:38:18,560
It's okay.

2770
01:38:19,220 --> 01:38:19,940
It's okay.

2771
01:38:20,060 --> 01:38:20,820
Everything is fine.

2772
01:38:23,660 --> 01:38:25,440
I remember where the DMV is.

2773
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:29,340
Oh no.

2774
01:38:30,240 --> 01:38:30,800
Oh no.

2775
01:38:33,540 --> 01:38:34,100
No!

2776
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:35,840
Ah!

2777
01:38:36,260 --> 01:38:37,460
It's so far!

2778
01:38:40,640 --> 01:38:42,160
Why is it so far?

2779
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:44,540
Why is it so far?

2780
01:38:46,940 --> 01:38:47,720
Why is it so far?

2781
01:38:49,120 --> 01:38:49,860
No!

2782
01:38:50,700 --> 01:38:50,780
Ah!

2783
01:38:54,580 --> 01:38:57,540
Why is it so far?

2784
01:38:57,560 --> 01:38:59,960
Put you put photography in the Bridal magazines.

2785
01:39:01,120 --> 01:39:02,800
There was a shortcut.

2786
01:39:03,100 --> 01:39:04,100
Oh fuck!

2787
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:05,920
There was a shortcut!

2788
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:12,160
And I didn't... no... no...

2789
01:39:15,080 --> 01:39:18,340
I'm falling in the parkour area.

2790
01:39:19,640 --> 01:39:22,260
That was... are you serious?

2791
01:39:25,580 --> 01:39:28,400
Oh my god, and then he does a u-turn.

2792
01:39:28,720 --> 01:39:32,060
And then he fucking does a u-turn, this fucker.

2793
01:39:32,240 --> 01:39:34,160
This actual fucker.

2794
01:39:39,020 --> 01:39:42,100
Oh my god, I can't believe it.

2795
01:39:42,220 --> 01:39:43,200
He fucked me up.

2796
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:45,940
This mission, this mission is bullshit.

2797
01:39:46,600 --> 01:39:49,000
This mission is actually bullshit.

2798
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:57,220
Okay, it's so far from the DMV too!

2799
01:40:01,390 --> 01:40:03,390
Okay, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

2800
01:40:03,870 --> 01:40:05,370
I know he goes this way.

2801
01:40:05,730 --> 01:40:06,470
I just gotta wait.

2802
01:40:08,390 --> 01:40:09,170
I just gotta wait.

2803
01:40:10,930 --> 01:40:12,190
All right, all right, I'm locked in.

2804
01:40:15,930 --> 01:40:16,630
All right, and then...

2805
01:40:21,270 --> 01:40:23,430
Get out, get out of the car, get out of the car, it's parkour time!

2806
01:40:23,670 --> 01:40:24,610
Get out of the car!

2807
01:40:25,770 --> 01:40:30,790
Oh my god, it's parkour time, this stupid fucking...

2808
01:40:30,790 --> 01:40:33,590
Oh my god, I'm stuck!

2809
01:40:36,770 --> 01:40:37,290
Okay.

2810
01:40:40,440 --> 01:40:40,970
Okay.

2811
01:40:42,870 --> 01:40:43,650
Come on.

2812
01:40:43,970 --> 01:40:44,370
No!

2813
01:40:44,370 --> 01:40:44,410
No!

2814
01:40:52,610 --> 01:40:53,770
Slowing me down.

2815
01:40:55,450 --> 01:40:56,470
I can't.

2816
01:40:59,350 --> 01:41:00,990
It's already over.

2817
01:41:01,670 --> 01:41:03,410
It's already over.

2818
01:41:03,750 --> 01:41:04,630
I can't.

2819
01:41:04,630 --> 01:41:07,430
Why do you put parkour?

2820
01:41:08,410 --> 01:41:09,050
Why?

2821
01:41:14,670 --> 01:41:17,810
Oh my god, it's already over.

2822
01:41:18,790 --> 01:41:20,490
I didn't crash out, guys.

2823
01:41:20,490 --> 01:41:22,130
I kept playing, guys.

2824
01:41:22,350 --> 01:41:24,030
There was no crash out.

2825
01:41:24,250 --> 01:41:26,890
There was no crash out in Ba Sing Se.

2826
01:41:27,750 --> 01:41:29,210
I didn't crash out.

2827
01:41:29,210 --> 01:41:30,130
I kept playing.

2828
01:41:30,130 --> 01:41:31,190
I kept playing.

2829
01:41:33,450 --> 01:41:35,170
I kept playing everyone.

2830
01:41:35,590 --> 01:41:37,330
There was no crash out.

2831
01:41:44,620 --> 01:41:45,180
Okay.

2832
01:41:46,620 --> 01:41:47,500
I need you.

2833
01:41:47,780 --> 01:41:48,240
I need you.

2834
01:41:48,500 --> 01:41:49,000
Get over me.

2835
01:41:49,120 --> 01:41:49,600
Give me your car.

2836
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:55,440
Okay.

2837
01:41:56,300 --> 01:41:57,380
Give me your car.

2838
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:03,960
Okay.

2839
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:09,480
My... No!

2840
01:42:09,740 --> 01:42:09,880
No!

2841
01:42:09,880 --> 01:42:12,520
No, you cannot be fucking with me right now.

2842
01:42:18,930 --> 01:42:20,390
Jesus Christ.

2843
01:42:26,540 --> 01:42:28,580
Oh my God!

2844
01:42:40,660 --> 01:42:42,780
Wait, where's the... Oh!

2845
01:42:43,180 --> 01:42:45,380
I forgot about the alley!

2846
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:45,540
Holy!

2847
01:42:46,340 --> 01:42:48,760
Just give me a minute to catch my breath.

2848
01:42:51,380 --> 01:42:51,980
Oh!

2849
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:52,720
It's over.

2850
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:55,620
It's over.

2851
01:42:57,220 --> 01:42:57,760
It's over.

2852
01:42:58,460 --> 01:43:04,920
There's only... I forgot about... It's already over.

2853
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:08,580
I... It took me 28 seconds to even get on that car.

2854
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:10,840
It took... It's already over.

2855
01:43:11,500 --> 01:43:13,360
It's already over, guys.

2856
01:43:13,680 --> 01:43:14,480
There's no way.

2857
01:43:14,640 --> 01:43:15,320
There's no way.

2858
01:43:15,320 --> 01:43:17,280
I'm making it there in 20 seconds.

2859
01:43:18,220 --> 01:43:25,160
It's... There's a car in front of me that's... Oh my God!

2860
01:43:25,960 --> 01:43:27,800
Is this the shortcut right here?

2861
01:43:27,880 --> 01:43:29,160
Is this the shortcut, guys?

2862
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:30,320
Okay.

2863
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:31,860
We're not getting this car anymore.

2864
01:43:33,140 --> 01:43:33,580
Yippie!

2865
01:43:41,780 --> 01:43:42,220
Okay.

2866
01:43:42,500 --> 01:43:43,900
We got... I'm getting a different car.

2867
01:43:44,420 --> 01:43:44,960
This ain't it.

2868
01:43:45,080 --> 01:43:46,560
This is not the right car for me.

2869
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:47,820
Oh.

2870
01:43:48,020 --> 01:43:48,460
Whatever.

2871
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:48,940
Okay.

2872
01:43:49,280 --> 01:43:49,700
Doesn't matter.

2873
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:55,800
This car is so hard to drive.

2874
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:00,160
I knew it.

2875
01:44:01,520 --> 01:44:02,820
This ain't it, chief.

2876
01:44:06,080 --> 01:44:10,200
I hate how it does, like, a detorture and then comes back.

2877
01:44:10,540 --> 01:44:12,220
Like, make up your mind!

2878
01:44:15,280 --> 01:44:17,480
Okay, I figured out the parkour, guys.

2879
01:44:17,720 --> 01:44:18,660
I figured it out.

2880
01:44:26,550 --> 01:44:27,270
Okay.

2881
01:44:27,270 --> 01:44:27,990
Alright.

2882
01:44:29,730 --> 01:44:30,890
Okay, it's fine.

2883
01:44:31,250 --> 01:44:31,590
It's fine.

2884
01:44:31,750 --> 01:44:32,550
Everything is fine.

2885
01:44:34,830 --> 01:44:36,410
Everything is so fine.

2886
01:44:37,490 --> 01:44:39,870
I... Oh, my God.

2887
01:44:41,830 --> 01:44:44,290
Oh, my God.

2888
01:44:44,590 --> 01:44:45,270
Okay, it's fine.

2889
01:44:45,690 --> 01:44:46,950
Everything is fine.

2890
01:44:47,370 --> 01:44:49,930
Everything is so fine.

2891
01:44:52,590 --> 01:44:54,230
I hate this car.

2892
01:44:54,470 --> 01:44:57,390
I absolutely hate this car, guys.

2893
01:44:58,290 --> 01:44:59,170
Alright.

2894
01:44:59,670 --> 01:45:01,090
It's parkour time.

2895
01:45:02,310 --> 01:45:03,710
It's park.

2896
01:45:05,470 --> 01:45:06,730
Here we go.

2897
01:45:07,650 --> 01:45:09,330
Back to the roots.

2898
01:45:13,770 --> 01:45:14,690
Okay.

2899
01:45:23,780 --> 01:45:25,740
Okay, I made the first...

2900
01:45:25,740 --> 01:45:26,940
The first hurdle.

2901
01:45:30,820 --> 01:45:32,640
The first hurdle is done.

2902
01:45:34,440 --> 01:45:37,180
Just give me a minute to catch my breath.

2903
01:45:38,660 --> 01:45:38,980
Okay.

2904
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:43,120
Alright.

2905
01:45:43,660 --> 01:45:44,600
Ramp time.

2906
01:45:49,340 --> 01:45:49,980
Boom.

2907
01:45:50,360 --> 01:45:50,880
Boom.

2908
01:45:51,420 --> 01:45:52,060
Okay.

2909
01:45:52,420 --> 01:45:53,700
And then we gotta steal a car.

2910
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:55,640
I should sleep more.

2911
01:45:58,600 --> 01:45:59,240
Alright.

2912
01:46:01,700 --> 01:46:02,600
Oh my god.

2913
01:46:02,720 --> 01:46:03,440
It's broken already.

2914
01:46:04,140 --> 01:46:05,020
It's broken already.

2915
01:46:05,160 --> 01:46:06,540
What do you mean it's already?

2916
01:46:10,740 --> 01:46:11,380
Okay.

2917
01:46:29,620 --> 01:46:31,560
I'm so focused right now, guys.

2918
01:46:31,700 --> 01:46:32,420
You don't understand.

2919
01:46:32,840 --> 01:46:35,260
I hate this level so much.

2920
01:46:41,930 --> 01:46:42,950
Oh my god.

2921
01:46:43,090 --> 01:46:44,250
I didn't realize that was all.

2922
01:46:46,210 --> 01:46:46,650
Okay.

2923
01:46:47,150 --> 01:46:47,430
Okay.

2924
01:46:47,550 --> 01:46:47,950
I'm running.

2925
01:46:48,250 --> 01:46:49,370
I'm locked in.

2926
01:46:52,050 --> 01:46:52,490
Okay.

2927
01:46:52,670 --> 01:46:53,390
We need to grab.

2928
01:46:53,710 --> 01:46:54,110
Oh my god.

2929
01:46:54,250 --> 01:46:55,110
Which one was Homer?

2930
01:46:55,370 --> 01:46:55,770
Give me a ride.

2931
01:46:55,950 --> 01:46:58,150
I will pay you a million dollars in the next life.

2932
01:46:58,150 --> 01:46:58,650
I promise.

2933
01:47:01,750 --> 01:47:02,230
Alright.

2934
01:47:02,250 --> 01:47:02,390
Alright.

2935
01:47:02,430 --> 01:47:02,850
This is it.

2936
01:47:04,230 --> 01:47:04,710
Okay.

2937
01:47:04,810 --> 01:47:05,130
Good time.

2938
01:47:05,310 --> 01:47:05,670
Good time.

2939
01:47:08,590 --> 01:47:09,370
Lock in.

2940
01:47:10,090 --> 01:47:11,390
Lock the fuck in.

2941
01:47:14,530 --> 01:47:15,390
I just gotta go.

2942
01:47:15,450 --> 01:47:16,230
Oh fuck.

2943
01:47:17,330 --> 01:47:17,950
Gotta go straight.

2944
01:47:18,210 --> 01:47:19,630
I gotta go straight for the shortcut.

2945
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:27,840
This better be a fucking shortcut.

2946
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:29,620
I swear to god, guys.

2947
01:47:31,340 --> 01:47:31,880
Guys.

2948
01:47:31,880 --> 01:47:33,740
Oh, Shiva smiles on such behavior.

2949
01:47:38,640 --> 01:47:41,180
Guys, I don't think this is a shortcut anymore.

2950
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:42,380
Guys.

2951
01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:46,060
Oh, wait.

2952
01:47:46,060 --> 01:47:48,300
What are you trying to prove with this crazy driving?

2953
01:47:48,600 --> 01:47:49,080
Oh, no.

2954
01:47:49,760 --> 01:47:50,180
Oh, no.

2955
01:47:51,460 --> 01:47:52,200
Oh, no.

2956
01:47:52,760 --> 01:47:53,080
Oh, no.

2957
01:47:53,080 --> 01:47:53,280
Oh, no.

2958
01:47:55,620 --> 01:47:56,780
Move it, Cracker.

2959
01:47:58,400 --> 01:47:58,460
Move it, Cracker.

2960
01:47:58,640 --> 01:47:59,600
What the...

2961
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:00,680
What the...

2962
01:48:01,340 --> 01:48:02,220
Oh my god.

2963
01:48:02,360 --> 01:48:02,800
It was...

2964
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:03,760
It was a shortcut.

2965
01:48:04,040 --> 01:48:04,560
Oh my god.

2966
01:48:04,680 --> 01:48:05,540
You didn't lie.

2967
01:48:05,980 --> 01:48:06,640
Oh my god.

2968
01:48:06,840 --> 01:48:08,220
Chat was right.

2969
01:48:08,900 --> 01:48:09,320
Oh.

2970
01:48:09,580 --> 01:48:11,060
Chat was actually right.

2971
01:48:11,560 --> 01:48:11,680
Oh.

2972
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:12,140
Thank you.

2973
01:48:12,420 --> 01:48:13,820
Thank you, my violent associate.

2974
01:48:15,020 --> 01:48:15,580
Oh my god.

2975
01:48:15,660 --> 01:48:16,100
We did it.

2976
01:48:17,020 --> 01:48:18,680
Got to enter the DMV.

2977
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:20,600
I can't believe it.

2978
01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:22,440
Chat was actually right.

2979
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:24,600
I got the folder.

2980
01:48:25,340 --> 01:48:26,780
Chat was always...

2981
01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:28,500
I didn't get one guide.

2982
01:48:30,440 --> 01:48:31,840
Oh my god.

2983
01:48:32,060 --> 01:48:33,920
I didn't get one guide.

2984
01:48:37,260 --> 01:48:38,680
Alright, here's the folder.

2985
01:48:40,020 --> 01:48:40,420
Yeah.

2986
01:48:40,420 --> 01:48:42,840
One thing, but I never expected you to lie.

2987
01:48:43,200 --> 01:48:44,820
Dude, relax, okay?

2988
01:48:45,080 --> 01:48:46,360
I've got the info you need.

2989
01:48:46,740 --> 01:48:50,100
I just need help with a little more community service.

2990
01:48:50,460 --> 01:48:50,860
Huh?

2991
01:48:51,860 --> 01:48:52,640
I'm totally evil.

2992
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:56,000
I should know better than to trust that demented chuckle.

2993
01:48:56,660 --> 01:48:57,040
But okay.

2994
01:48:58,020 --> 01:48:59,260
Okay, it should be fine.

2995
01:48:59,420 --> 01:49:00,560
Help Snape with his community server.

2996
01:49:00,680 --> 01:49:02,700
Destroy the armor car and avoid cheap Wiggum.

2997
01:49:03,500 --> 01:49:04,560
Alright, this will be fine.

2998
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:06,180
No, it's okay, guys.

2999
01:49:08,360 --> 01:49:09,760
What could go wrong?

3000
01:49:10,140 --> 01:49:11,520
By not saving.

3001
01:49:12,520 --> 01:49:13,960
What could go wrong?

3002
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:20,240
Alright, guys.

3003
01:49:20,380 --> 01:49:21,240
It's alright, guys.

3004
01:49:21,380 --> 01:49:22,200
I love playing.

3005
01:49:22,840 --> 01:49:23,960
With fire.

3006
01:49:24,660 --> 01:49:24,860
Okay.

3007
01:49:26,360 --> 01:49:27,600
It's the risk.

3008
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:28,180
What's...

3009
01:49:28,180 --> 01:49:28,720
It's so...

3010
01:49:28,720 --> 01:49:30,520
You know, the risk is half the fun.

3011
01:49:35,540 --> 01:49:36,500
You guys...

3012
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:39,880
The risk is half the fun, guys.

3013
01:49:40,100 --> 01:49:40,560
Don't worry.

3014
01:49:45,030 --> 01:49:45,930
Oh my god.

3015
01:49:45,990 --> 01:49:48,430
How far is the Googleplex?

3016
01:49:52,390 --> 01:49:52,870
Okay.

3017
01:49:53,450 --> 01:49:54,630
Oh wait, oh wait.

3018
01:49:54,870 --> 01:49:55,590
Oh shit, sorry.

3019
01:49:55,730 --> 01:49:56,990
I didn't even realize I'm getting...

3020
01:49:56,990 --> 01:49:58,710
I didn't even realize I was getting chased.

3021
01:49:59,030 --> 01:50:00,470
I was like, hello, chief Wiggum.

3022
01:50:00,470 --> 01:50:02,210
How are you doing?

3023
01:50:02,590 --> 01:50:04,190
How are you doing?

3024
01:50:04,370 --> 01:50:05,470
I was just...

3025
01:50:05,470 --> 01:50:07,350
Chilling with the cops, you know?

3026
01:50:08,490 --> 01:50:11,410
I was literally being like, hey, how's it going, chief?

3027
01:50:12,210 --> 01:50:14,010
What are you doing in this fine day?

3028
01:50:19,210 --> 01:50:19,810
Okay.

3029
01:50:20,570 --> 01:50:23,730
Now we drive to the Googleplex.

3030
01:50:26,750 --> 01:50:27,350
Nice.

3031
01:50:28,930 --> 01:50:30,950
Oh, I should get the wrench real quick, too.

3032
01:50:31,210 --> 01:50:32,450
Before I go to the Googleplex.

3033
01:50:32,770 --> 01:50:33,830
This town is going to pay for this.

3034
01:50:34,890 --> 01:50:36,650
Hasta la vista, suckers.

3035
01:50:37,290 --> 01:50:37,910
Alright, nice.

3036
01:50:38,110 --> 01:50:41,490
Okay, if I'm going to be ramming stuff, I have to go to the...

3037
01:50:41,490 --> 01:50:42,570
Get that wrench first.

3038
01:50:44,210 --> 01:50:46,030
I make this look easy.

3039
01:50:46,150 --> 01:50:47,950
Oh my god.

3040
01:50:48,070 --> 01:50:48,860
It's armored!

3041
01:50:49,730 --> 01:50:51,870
I have a convertible!

3042
01:50:57,200 --> 01:50:57,940
Like...

3043
01:50:57,940 --> 01:50:59,360
What in the hell were you thinking?

3044
01:50:59,680 --> 01:51:02,120
My car is a convertible!

3045
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:05,020
What do I do against that?

3046
01:51:08,820 --> 01:51:10,480
Oh my god!

3047
01:51:10,900 --> 01:51:12,660
Oh my god!

3048
01:51:13,260 --> 01:51:14,340
Oh my god!

3049
01:51:15,060 --> 01:51:17,500
I'm trying my best!

3050
01:51:19,720 --> 01:51:20,100
Bro!

3051
01:51:24,240 --> 01:51:25,960
At least it has no time.

3052
01:51:26,140 --> 01:51:29,540
I think I have to do this before my fucking car crashes.

3053
01:51:29,540 --> 01:51:29,820
Yes!

3054
01:51:33,440 --> 01:51:35,460
What the hell was Snake thinking?

3055
01:51:40,550 --> 01:51:41,430
This is...

3056
01:51:41,430 --> 01:51:42,270
Oh my god!

3057
01:51:42,450 --> 01:51:44,270
My car is going to explode, guys.

3058
01:51:44,730 --> 01:51:46,310
Guys, I need to find a wrench.

3059
01:51:46,490 --> 01:51:47,350
Give me a sec.

3060
01:51:47,890 --> 01:51:48,350
This car...

3061
01:51:49,770 --> 01:51:50,610
No then...

3062
01:51:55,570 --> 01:51:56,970
Snake doesn't think...

3063
01:51:57,950 --> 01:51:58,510
Clearly!

3064
01:51:59,170 --> 01:52:02,590
Why did you bring a convertible on this mission?

3065
01:52:03,390 --> 01:52:04,930
I need to find a wrench!

3066
01:52:05,110 --> 01:52:06,330
I'm just following, guys.

3067
01:52:06,510 --> 01:52:07,110
Give me a sec.

3068
01:52:07,370 --> 01:52:10,650
My car will explode if I touch him one more time.

3069
01:52:12,870 --> 01:52:14,670
You'd be no time, man.

3070
01:52:19,570 --> 01:52:20,490
Is there...

3071
01:52:20,490 --> 01:52:21,490
Where are the wrenches?

3072
01:52:21,650 --> 01:52:22,390
Oh, there's the wrench.

3073
01:52:22,390 --> 01:52:23,070
There it is.

3074
01:52:24,110 --> 01:52:24,910
There it is.

3075
01:52:25,830 --> 01:52:26,310
Okay.

3076
01:52:28,290 --> 01:52:28,770
Alright.

3077
01:52:29,430 --> 01:52:30,450
Got the wrench.

3078
01:52:31,290 --> 01:52:31,770
Okay.

3079
01:52:33,550 --> 01:52:34,270
Alright.

3080
01:52:34,630 --> 01:52:35,490
At least...

3081
01:52:35,490 --> 01:52:36,890
Things will be okay now.

3082
01:52:40,250 --> 01:52:40,970
Okay.

3083
01:52:42,310 --> 01:52:43,750
I'm just slowly...

3084
01:52:43,750 --> 01:52:45,690
Ramming it slowly into...

3085
01:52:46,590 --> 01:52:47,650
Into the wall.

3086
01:52:48,670 --> 01:52:49,810
There we go.

3087
01:52:50,830 --> 01:52:51,810
There we go.

3088
01:52:53,250 --> 01:52:56,410
As long as he keeps hitting himself, we're fine.

3089
01:52:56,410 --> 01:52:56,490
Alright.

3090
01:52:57,610 --> 01:53:00,550
As long as my car is okay, we're fine too.

3091
01:53:08,390 --> 01:53:08,950
Okay.

3092
01:53:11,470 --> 01:53:12,350
There we go.

3093
01:53:12,630 --> 01:53:13,310
Let me...

3094
01:53:13,990 --> 01:53:15,010
There we go.

3095
01:53:15,430 --> 01:53:16,070
There we go.

3096
01:53:16,150 --> 01:53:18,130
I have the wall on my side.

3097
01:53:21,250 --> 01:53:21,950
Oh my god.

3098
01:53:22,110 --> 01:53:22,290
Oh my god.

3099
01:53:22,430 --> 01:53:22,770
That's fine.

3100
01:53:26,550 --> 01:53:26,870
Alright.

3101
01:53:27,150 --> 01:53:27,910
Nice, nice, nice.

3102
01:53:30,810 --> 01:53:31,130
Yippee!

3103
01:53:31,230 --> 01:53:31,610
The wall!

3104
01:53:38,470 --> 01:53:39,610
He's just gonna hit the wall.

3105
01:53:39,730 --> 01:53:40,930
He just needs to hit the wall one time.

3106
01:53:45,230 --> 01:53:45,810
Oh, wait.

3107
01:53:45,990 --> 01:53:46,610
He wanted to turn.

3108
01:53:46,750 --> 01:53:46,870
Okay.

3109
01:53:46,910 --> 01:53:47,810
I didn't think he was gonna turn.

3110
01:53:50,530 --> 01:53:51,430
Go to the wall.

3111
01:53:52,310 --> 01:53:52,790
Come on.

3112
01:53:52,910 --> 01:53:53,650
Go to the wall.

3113
01:53:54,070 --> 01:53:54,330
Come on.

3114
01:53:54,370 --> 01:53:56,170
Be a good truck and go to the wall!

3115
01:54:00,700 --> 01:54:01,060
Nice!

3116
01:54:01,740 --> 01:54:02,680
Hit yourself again!

3117
01:54:03,280 --> 01:54:04,100
Hit yourself again!

3118
01:54:04,320 --> 01:54:04,800
Hit yourself!

3119
01:54:04,840 --> 01:54:05,540
There we go!

3120
01:54:05,540 --> 01:54:06,660
This beat to the community.

3121
01:54:07,120 --> 01:54:09,040
Shut up and take us back to the fight out.

3122
01:54:09,280 --> 01:54:09,400
Alright.

3123
01:54:09,400 --> 01:54:10,260
I mean, um...

3124
01:54:10,260 --> 01:54:10,700
Charity.

3125
01:54:11,080 --> 01:54:11,780
Alright, nice.

3126
01:54:11,960 --> 01:54:12,600
Guys, look at that.

3127
01:54:12,640 --> 01:54:13,360
We did a good deed.

3128
01:54:13,540 --> 01:54:15,000
We're going to get charity now.

3129
01:54:15,500 --> 01:54:16,540
Look at that, guys.

3130
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:17,740
We're a good guy.

3131
01:54:18,740 --> 01:54:21,040
We're gonna get rewarded for our charity work.

3132
01:54:21,740 --> 01:54:22,900
Can I write this as...

3133
01:54:22,900 --> 01:54:24,240
Can this be a tax write-off?

3134
01:54:29,940 --> 01:54:30,340
Yippee!

3135
01:54:30,440 --> 01:54:31,480
I love charity!

3136
01:54:34,040 --> 01:54:34,440
Uh...

3137
01:54:34,440 --> 01:54:38,180
I never played this while I wanted to go into GTA 3 and say...

3138
01:54:38,180 --> 01:54:39,060
Hey, you have time now!

3139
01:54:39,260 --> 01:54:41,340
You have one more year until the next GTA comes out.

3140
01:54:41,400 --> 01:54:42,740
So, I might as well play this game.

3141
01:54:43,220 --> 01:54:43,600
Hahaha!

3142
01:54:44,120 --> 01:54:45,680
Morgan, thank you for the super chat.

3143
01:54:45,840 --> 01:54:46,120
Thank you.

3144
01:54:46,240 --> 01:54:46,660
Thank you.

3145
01:54:46,980 --> 01:54:48,060
Is that too soon?

3146
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:53,200
Yippee!

3147
01:54:54,100 --> 01:54:54,500
Hahaha!

3148
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:55,940
Too soon, guys?

3149
01:54:56,540 --> 01:54:57,620
Guys, I'm gonna make it.

3150
01:54:57,880 --> 01:54:58,280
Nevermind.

3151
01:54:59,380 --> 01:54:59,780
Alright.

3152
01:55:01,940 --> 01:55:02,500
Alright.

3153
01:55:04,660 --> 01:55:05,880
Let's go this way.

3154
01:55:08,980 --> 01:55:12,040
I feel like Chief Wiggum's gonna chase me, isn't he?

3155
01:55:13,440 --> 01:55:15,160
This feels like a chase angle.

3156
01:55:15,280 --> 01:55:16,120
I fucking knew.

3157
01:55:16,320 --> 01:55:16,760
Wait!

3158
01:55:17,020 --> 01:55:17,120
Wait!

3159
01:55:17,240 --> 01:55:18,700
Moe Savern is right behind me!

3160
01:55:19,240 --> 01:55:19,760
Wait a minute!

3161
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:20,500
Moe!

3162
01:55:22,820 --> 01:55:24,640
You know what that means!

3163
01:55:25,360 --> 01:55:25,860
Hahaha!

3164
01:55:28,380 --> 01:55:28,940
What?!

3165
01:55:28,940 --> 01:55:29,320
No!

3166
01:55:29,700 --> 01:55:30,200
What?!

3167
01:55:30,200 --> 01:55:30,580
Ah!

3168
01:55:31,340 --> 01:55:31,420
No!

3169
01:55:34,330 --> 01:55:39,050
No way!

3170
01:55:41,640 --> 01:55:43,180
I'm sad.

3171
01:55:43,580 --> 01:55:44,720
I can't.

3172
01:55:45,800 --> 01:55:49,620
You mean the strat didn't work?

3173
01:55:50,020 --> 01:55:51,160
I can't.

3174
01:55:52,040 --> 01:55:52,920
No!

3175
01:55:54,660 --> 01:55:58,320
I thought I was so smart.

3176
01:55:58,320 --> 01:56:00,480
The devs knew.

3177
01:56:01,100 --> 01:56:01,880
The devs knew.

3178
01:56:01,880 --> 01:56:03,240
They actually do.

3179
01:56:04,080 --> 01:56:05,420
They got me.

3180
01:56:06,100 --> 01:56:07,200
I couldn't.

3181
01:56:07,220 --> 01:56:10,640
I couldn't get past the devs this time.

3182
01:56:11,200 --> 01:56:12,400
You will be reincarnated.

3183
01:56:12,660 --> 01:56:14,380
They baited me.

3184
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,300
I can't believe it.

3185
01:56:18,920 --> 01:56:21,320
I got outplayed.

3186
01:56:21,480 --> 01:56:25,680
I actually got outplayed by the devs.

3187
01:56:26,500 --> 01:56:27,500
What a thought.

3188
01:56:29,440 --> 01:56:30,600
Oh my god.

3189
01:56:30,820 --> 01:56:32,680
I had to do the armor card again.

3190
01:56:33,600 --> 01:56:36,260
I thought I was doing so well.

3191
01:56:36,500 --> 01:56:38,120
I thought I was being so smart.

3192
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:40,500
I was like, hee hee.

3193
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:44,300
They planned it.

3194
01:56:44,420 --> 01:56:45,000
They knew.

3195
01:56:46,020 --> 01:56:47,040
They knew.

3196
01:56:50,660 --> 01:56:51,600
They knew.

3197
01:56:51,720 --> 01:56:52,280
They fucking knew.

3198
01:56:53,280 --> 01:56:53,720
Ew.

3199
01:56:53,880 --> 01:56:55,200
Now it was the word.

3200
01:56:55,360 --> 01:56:56,620
But sh- I was like, wait.

3201
01:56:56,800 --> 01:56:58,400
Bo's tavern is right here.

3202
01:57:00,420 --> 01:57:01,640
Oh my god.

3203
01:57:02,100 --> 01:57:03,580
I know what to do.

3204
01:57:05,520 --> 01:57:06,840
I played myself.

3205
01:57:07,060 --> 01:57:09,360
I have to do the stupid armor card shit again.

3206
01:57:13,340 --> 01:57:14,040
All right.

3207
01:57:14,500 --> 01:57:14,960
It's fine.

3208
01:57:15,100 --> 01:57:15,860
I know where to go.

3209
01:57:18,460 --> 01:57:18,980
Okay.

3210
01:57:21,320 --> 01:57:22,500
It's not that bad.

3211
01:57:22,740 --> 01:57:23,980
There's less traffic right now.

3212
01:57:24,540 --> 01:57:27,120
It's not rush hour anymore in the Simpsons universe.

3213
01:57:27,840 --> 01:57:28,360
Ow.

3214
01:57:31,080 --> 01:57:31,540
Wow.

3215
01:57:32,200 --> 01:57:32,820
All right.

3216
01:57:33,380 --> 01:57:34,680
Now to do this again.

3217
01:57:35,520 --> 01:57:36,800
God damn it!

3218
01:57:39,680 --> 01:57:40,620
Okay, it's fine.

3219
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:42,100
It's fine.

3220
01:57:42,100 --> 01:57:42,880
I know where to go.

3221
01:57:45,280 --> 01:57:46,800
I know where to go guys.

3222
01:57:47,040 --> 01:57:47,340
It's fine.

3223
01:57:48,060 --> 01:57:48,620
Oh shit.

3224
01:57:48,860 --> 01:57:50,000
Okay, I know where to go guys.

3225
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:50,580
It's fine.

3226
01:57:50,580 --> 01:57:50,840
Okay.

3227
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:54,900
I know how to lose him.

3228
01:57:56,320 --> 01:57:58,780
It worked before it shall work again.

3229
01:58:03,500 --> 01:58:04,580
How is this?

3230
01:58:06,760 --> 01:58:07,340
Nice.

3231
01:58:07,540 --> 01:58:07,640
Okay.

3232
01:58:08,400 --> 01:58:09,120
Okay, it's fine.

3233
01:58:12,740 --> 01:58:14,940
Quick go to Bo's.

3234
01:58:15,700 --> 01:58:17,140
Quick go to Bo's.

3235
01:58:17,240 --> 01:58:18,240
It'll work this time.

3236
01:58:19,740 --> 01:58:20,440
All right.

3237
01:58:21,100 --> 01:58:21,920
It's fine.

3238
01:58:22,200 --> 01:58:22,260
It's fine.

3239
01:58:22,260 --> 01:58:22,580
We're fine.

3240
01:58:22,900 --> 01:58:23,520
Everything's fine.

3241
01:58:23,660 --> 01:58:24,540
I just gotta fix my car.

3242
01:58:24,800 --> 01:58:26,920
Before we do the armor car shit again.

3243
01:58:29,560 --> 01:58:31,540
Let me find a wrench real quick.

3244
01:58:31,620 --> 01:58:32,180
Oh, there's a wrench.

3245
01:58:34,300 --> 01:58:34,960
It's okay.

3246
01:58:34,960 --> 01:58:36,080
I have a wrench right here.

3247
01:58:37,340 --> 01:58:37,860
See?

3248
01:58:38,020 --> 01:58:39,900
Nothing wrong is gonna happen to me.

3249
01:58:42,820 --> 01:58:43,500
All right.

3250
01:58:43,780 --> 01:58:45,000
Back to the armor car.

3251
01:58:45,820 --> 01:58:46,660
Oh no.

3252
01:58:48,380 --> 01:58:48,900
Okay.

3253
01:58:49,260 --> 01:58:49,740
It's okay.

3254
01:58:50,440 --> 01:58:50,940
That's okay.

3255
01:58:51,080 --> 01:58:51,360
It's fine.

3256
01:58:51,760 --> 01:58:55,980
As long as I don't run over anybody else or hit any other car, we're okay.

3257
01:58:56,740 --> 01:58:58,360
And just grind to the wall.

3258
01:58:59,560 --> 01:59:00,480
Grind to the wall.

3259
01:59:01,880 --> 01:59:04,800
Dude, you better not have scratched my car.

3260
01:59:05,260 --> 01:59:05,460
No.

3261
01:59:07,140 --> 01:59:07,700
Grind...

3262
01:59:07,700 --> 01:59:08,060
No!

3263
01:59:08,480 --> 01:59:08,640
Fuck!

3264
01:59:11,420 --> 01:59:12,380
Oh my...

3265
01:59:12,380 --> 01:59:13,940
God, I hate this car.

3266
01:59:15,460 --> 01:59:16,800
What are we gonna do now.

3267
01:59:17,560 --> 01:59:19,120
That's right, what are you gonna do now?

3268
01:59:19,340 --> 01:59:19,880
Nothing.

3269
01:59:23,760 --> 01:59:25,340
No, I can't!

3270
01:59:26,900 --> 01:59:30,100
Why isn't it hitting the closer to the wall?

3271
01:59:33,160 --> 01:59:34,380
Oh my god.

3272
01:59:35,780 --> 01:59:38,100
The scratching ASMR.

3273
01:59:39,380 --> 01:59:40,580
I'm so sad.

3274
01:59:41,960 --> 01:59:42,500
Wait, wait, wait.

3275
01:59:42,540 --> 01:59:42,800
Here we go.

3276
01:59:43,400 --> 01:59:44,260
Here we go, I did it.

3277
01:59:45,440 --> 01:59:47,040
This needs to be against that wall.

3278
01:59:48,860 --> 01:59:49,720
There we go.

3279
01:59:50,960 --> 01:59:51,780
There we go.

3280
01:59:52,300 --> 01:59:53,160
Lots of damage.

3281
01:59:53,960 --> 01:59:55,460
Oh my god.

3282
01:59:56,020 --> 01:59:57,420
Oh my god.

3283
01:59:57,640 --> 01:59:59,580
The stupid fucking truck.

3284
02:00:02,780 --> 02:00:03,620
There we go.

3285
02:00:04,860 --> 02:00:05,760
Yes, hit that wall.

3286
02:00:05,900 --> 02:00:07,100
No, I was supposed to hit the wall.

3287
02:00:07,260 --> 02:00:07,400
Yes.

3288
02:00:07,860 --> 02:00:08,940
Yes, hit Mayor Quimby.

3289
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:14,480
Nice.

3290
02:00:14,480 --> 02:00:14,880
Okay.

3291
02:00:16,880 --> 02:00:17,740
Now hit that.

3292
02:00:17,980 --> 02:00:18,120
Good.

3293
02:00:20,840 --> 02:00:21,620
Plan, plan.

3294
02:00:23,100 --> 02:00:23,940
Now hit that.

3295
02:00:24,220 --> 02:00:25,480
Please, please hit that pillar.

3296
02:00:25,720 --> 02:00:26,220
Hit that pillar.

3297
02:00:26,400 --> 02:00:27,000
Hit that pillar.

3298
02:00:27,220 --> 02:00:27,500
Yes.

3299
02:00:29,500 --> 02:00:30,380
Okay, look.

3300
02:00:30,480 --> 02:00:31,460
See, look at that plan.

3301
02:00:32,400 --> 02:00:33,160
It hit the pillar.

3302
02:00:33,440 --> 02:00:34,280
That's all I wanted.

3303
02:00:35,260 --> 02:00:36,440
Hit the ambulance.

3304
02:00:36,860 --> 02:00:37,860
There's nobody in there.

3305
02:00:38,140 --> 02:00:39,920
And if there is, she's already dead.

3306
02:00:42,660 --> 02:00:43,800
Okay, I need to hit it.

3307
02:00:44,280 --> 02:00:45,520
Squeeze it to the wall again.

3308
02:00:48,320 --> 02:00:48,840
My...

3309
02:00:48,840 --> 02:00:50,880
Oh fuck, he was gonna turn anyway.

3310
02:00:51,760 --> 02:00:52,400
God damn it.

3311
02:00:54,020 --> 02:00:54,420
Here we go.

3312
02:00:55,260 --> 02:00:56,520
Grinding it against the wall.

3313
02:00:57,040 --> 02:00:59,100
The damage will build up on itself.

3314
02:01:00,760 --> 02:01:02,260
Slow and steady, guys.

3315
02:01:02,840 --> 02:01:03,860
Slow and steady.

3316
02:01:04,160 --> 02:01:05,620
Win some race.

3317
02:01:06,520 --> 02:01:07,600
Slow and steady.

3318
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:08,980
It's gonna eventually hit.

3319
02:01:10,240 --> 02:01:11,580
It's a long game.

3320
02:01:11,780 --> 02:01:11,960
No!

3321
02:01:12,780 --> 02:01:15,200
Okay, I need to fix my own car first.

3322
02:01:15,720 --> 02:01:16,860
I gotta find a wrench.

3323
02:01:17,160 --> 02:01:19,760
I can't grind it against the wall anymore.

3324
02:01:22,880 --> 02:01:24,380
And we gotta make sure we don't lose the truck.

3325
02:01:26,240 --> 02:01:28,980
It's working, but like, my car's not okay.

3326
02:01:31,200 --> 02:01:34,200
My car is absolutely not okay right now.

3327
02:01:36,660 --> 02:01:39,780
So I need to find a wrench before I do anything else.

3328
02:01:41,500 --> 02:01:44,720
Don't worry, I can follow you till the end of time, car.

3329
02:01:47,680 --> 02:01:48,780
Until I get a wrench.

3330
02:01:48,920 --> 02:01:49,360
Oh, there it is.

3331
02:01:54,670 --> 02:01:55,530
Wait, where is it?

3332
02:01:56,130 --> 02:01:56,930
Wait, where did it go?

3333
02:01:57,990 --> 02:01:59,030
Wait, where did it go?

3334
02:02:00,190 --> 02:02:00,970
Oh, there he is.

3335
02:02:01,030 --> 02:02:01,330
There he is.

3336
02:02:01,390 --> 02:02:02,430
You thought you could lose me?

3337
02:02:02,870 --> 02:02:04,270
You could never lose me.

3338
02:02:05,870 --> 02:02:06,530
That's right.

3339
02:02:07,690 --> 02:02:09,790
I'm always right behind you.

3340
02:02:11,510 --> 02:02:13,250
Right behind you.

3341
02:02:13,530 --> 02:02:14,710
I'm always here.

3342
02:02:17,870 --> 02:02:19,070
Don't worry.

3343
02:02:19,950 --> 02:02:21,790
Y'all never escape me.

3344
02:02:22,310 --> 02:02:22,570
Oh.

3345
02:02:23,750 --> 02:02:25,550
I still have that wall.

3346
02:02:27,850 --> 02:02:28,810
There you go.

3347
02:02:33,910 --> 02:02:35,170
Still have the wall.

3348
02:02:36,970 --> 02:02:38,010
That's right.

3349
02:02:40,010 --> 02:02:41,070
Oh, where the fuck?

3350
02:02:41,150 --> 02:02:42,410
That car wanted in on the action.

3351
02:02:42,410 --> 02:02:43,590
There we go.

3352
02:02:45,090 --> 02:02:46,210
Jesus Christ.

3353
02:02:47,410 --> 02:02:48,050
All right.

3354
02:02:48,470 --> 02:02:48,990
You did it.

3355
02:02:50,530 --> 02:02:52,230
Me and that wall, we have history.

3356
02:02:53,830 --> 02:02:54,550
Oh, no.

3357
02:02:54,690 --> 02:02:56,950
Okay, I need to get rid of cheap Wiggums.

3358
02:02:57,330 --> 02:02:58,170
This time.

3359
02:03:14,370 --> 02:03:16,010
All right.

3360
02:03:16,390 --> 02:03:17,630
Time to drive back home.

3361
02:03:18,830 --> 02:03:19,970
Let's go.

3362
02:03:24,350 --> 02:03:26,990
All right, Chief Wiggum should be nearby now.

3363
02:03:27,910 --> 02:03:30,010
Guys, no more going to Moe's this time, guys.

3364
02:03:30,010 --> 02:03:30,890
I learned my lesson.

3365
02:03:31,230 --> 02:03:33,190
I'm not going back to Moe's.

3366
02:03:33,750 --> 02:03:37,590
Despite how tempted I am, we do not go back to Moe's.

3367
02:03:38,130 --> 02:03:42,630
Wait, we make sure we do not go back to Moe's, guys.

3368
02:03:47,090 --> 02:03:49,350
God damn it, how do I lose him?

3369
02:03:50,210 --> 02:03:51,170
Do I go this way?

3370
02:03:52,190 --> 02:03:53,230
Oh, I did it.

3371
02:03:53,510 --> 02:03:54,210
Wait, what?

3372
02:03:54,410 --> 02:03:54,950
How did I...

3373
02:03:54,950 --> 02:03:56,610
How did I lose him?

3374
02:03:56,810 --> 02:03:57,870
Where did he go?

3375
02:04:01,990 --> 02:04:02,750
Oh, nice.

3376
02:04:06,150 --> 02:04:07,690
I don't know how I did it.

3377
02:04:09,330 --> 02:04:10,490
We're not allowed that.

3378
02:04:10,650 --> 02:04:11,450
Not on Fox.

3379
02:04:11,970 --> 02:04:12,570
Back then.

3380
02:04:12,570 --> 02:04:13,970
We're registered to the museum.

3381
02:04:14,210 --> 02:04:14,950
The museum?

3382
02:04:15,650 --> 02:04:15,750
What?

3383
02:04:16,270 --> 02:04:19,550
Each level of this adventure is more exciting than the last...

3384
02:04:19,550 --> 02:04:20,970
Thank you all for coming.

3385
02:04:21,290 --> 02:04:21,510
Yeah.

3386
02:04:21,610 --> 02:04:22,370
I'll see you in the hall.

3387
02:04:24,510 --> 02:04:25,170
Talked apart.

3388
02:04:25,630 --> 02:04:25,970
All right, guys.

3389
02:04:26,110 --> 02:04:29,870
Before I do the next one, how many more mini missions do I have for a pool?

3390
02:04:31,310 --> 02:04:33,310
Before I do the next one, I just want to make sure.

3391
02:04:35,490 --> 02:04:36,590
Look at that car.

3392
02:04:37,010 --> 02:04:37,330
Which one?

3393
02:04:37,330 --> 02:04:37,890
In this one.

3394
02:04:39,430 --> 02:04:40,230
Oh, gas.

3395
02:04:40,430 --> 02:04:40,930
I don't know.

3396
02:04:41,130 --> 02:04:42,150
I don't know.

3397
02:04:42,550 --> 02:04:42,970
Oh, yeah.

3398
02:04:43,050 --> 02:04:43,410
I should save.

3399
02:04:43,470 --> 02:04:43,990
I'll save game.

3400
02:04:47,830 --> 02:04:48,450
Last one?

3401
02:04:48,610 --> 02:04:49,430
Okay, it's the last one.

3402
02:04:49,590 --> 02:04:49,790
All right.

3403
02:04:51,410 --> 02:04:52,810
All right, I'll do this last one.

3404
02:04:53,710 --> 02:04:54,430
I have time.

3405
02:04:55,010 --> 02:04:55,990
Oh, Mr. Bart.

3406
02:04:56,150 --> 02:05:00,170
I have discovered that the evil cola is being made in the Springfield Museum.

3407
02:05:00,330 --> 02:05:01,790
But that closes in five minutes.

3408
02:05:02,190 --> 02:05:03,490
And my car is out of gas.

3409
02:05:03,750 --> 02:05:05,090
Just fill it up at the Quickie Mart.

3410
02:05:05,430 --> 02:05:06,230
At those prices?

3411
02:05:06,670 --> 02:05:06,970
No way.

3412
02:05:07,170 --> 02:05:08,610
Fine, we'll take my car.

3413
02:05:10,070 --> 02:05:10,470
Oh, nice.

3414
02:05:10,690 --> 02:05:10,810
Drive.

3415
02:05:10,930 --> 02:05:11,150
Oh, wait.

3416
02:05:11,310 --> 02:05:12,170
Bart's back to normal.

3417
02:05:13,390 --> 02:05:13,850
That's what?

3418
02:05:14,610 --> 02:05:17,670
Must admit, the smell of fresh air is much more...

3419
02:05:17,670 --> 02:05:18,110
20...

3420
02:05:18,110 --> 02:05:19,670
They said five minutes!

3421
02:05:19,730 --> 02:05:21,070
Wait, Bart has...

3422
02:05:21,070 --> 02:05:22,730
Bart, how did you get this car?

3423
02:05:23,410 --> 02:05:23,850
Bart...

3424
02:05:23,850 --> 02:05:24,590
What is this?

3425
02:05:25,150 --> 02:05:27,790
Right, the last time I saw it, it was a rocket car.

3426
02:05:27,970 --> 02:05:29,610
Where did you get this car, mister?

3427
02:05:30,830 --> 02:05:31,970
Also, they lied.

3428
02:05:32,110 --> 02:05:33,730
They said I had five minutes.

3429
02:05:33,830 --> 02:05:35,130
This is not five minutes.

3430
02:05:38,290 --> 02:05:39,110
Oh, no.

3431
02:05:39,910 --> 02:05:42,090
Destroy the corridor's car?

3432
02:05:42,390 --> 02:05:43,610
It's another...

3433
02:05:44,290 --> 02:05:44,790
Oh, man.

3434
02:05:48,750 --> 02:05:49,830
Oh, man.

3435
02:05:50,530 --> 02:05:52,270
It's another fucking...

3436
02:05:54,590 --> 02:05:57,650
I did not realize it was another destroy mission.

3437
02:05:58,170 --> 02:05:59,430
If I knew...

3438
02:05:59,430 --> 02:06:00,250
If I knew...

3439
02:06:00,250 --> 02:06:02,490
This might have not been the last...

3440
02:06:03,610 --> 02:06:04,290
Oh, my God.

3441
02:06:04,370 --> 02:06:04,810
Where am I?

3442
02:06:05,370 --> 02:06:05,930
Where am I?

3443
02:06:06,010 --> 02:06:08,550
I got put it against the wall like I did before.

3444
02:06:10,930 --> 02:06:11,930
Oh, my God.

3445
02:06:12,170 --> 02:06:14,470
The Quimby thing was definitely...

3446
02:06:19,270 --> 02:06:20,730
Oh, my God.

3447
02:06:22,570 --> 02:06:25,230
Why do I have to use Bart's fucking car?

3448
02:06:30,980 --> 02:06:32,760
Oh, my God.

3449
02:06:32,900 --> 02:06:33,680
I'm trying to...

3450
02:06:40,020 --> 02:06:42,360
I don't like this.

3451
02:06:42,620 --> 02:06:43,400
Okay.

3452
02:06:46,920 --> 02:06:47,720
Nice.

3453
02:06:48,440 --> 02:06:49,780
Keep crashing to itself.

3454
02:06:52,120 --> 02:06:52,640
Okay.

3455
02:06:56,930 --> 02:06:57,830
Come on.

3456
02:06:58,010 --> 02:06:59,270
Oh, I made him faster.

3457
02:07:03,650 --> 02:07:04,170
No!

3458
02:07:05,030 --> 02:07:06,690
That undercard sabotaged me.

3459
02:07:06,690 --> 02:07:07,350
Did you see...

3460
02:07:07,350 --> 02:07:08,390
Did you see his license plates?

3461
02:07:12,740 --> 02:07:13,820
Oh, my God.

3462
02:07:14,060 --> 02:07:14,860
Oh, my God.

3463
02:07:14,860 --> 02:07:16,160
I can't barely turn.

3464
02:07:20,990 --> 02:07:21,550
No.

3465
02:07:22,190 --> 02:07:22,550
No.

3466
02:07:22,750 --> 02:07:24,030
He needs one good hit.

3467
02:07:28,140 --> 02:07:28,700
Please.

3468
02:07:28,860 --> 02:07:29,740
Just hit yourself.

3469
02:07:30,140 --> 02:07:31,160
Just hit yourself.

3470
02:07:31,620 --> 02:07:32,040
Hey.

3471
02:07:35,160 --> 02:07:35,720
Please.

3472
02:07:36,680 --> 02:07:37,840
Please hit him.

3473
02:07:38,280 --> 02:07:38,980
Just hit him.

3474
02:07:39,080 --> 02:07:39,940
I don't care if you rush me.

3475
02:07:40,060 --> 02:07:40,800
Oh, thank God.

3476
02:07:41,280 --> 02:07:41,540
Okay.

3477
02:07:41,540 --> 02:07:42,080
That's fine.

3478
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:43,840
That's fine.

3479
02:07:44,560 --> 02:07:45,320
That's fine.

3480
02:07:45,440 --> 02:07:45,880
That's fine.

3481
02:07:46,720 --> 02:07:47,440
That's fine.

3482
02:07:47,440 --> 02:07:48,060
I'll take that.

3483
02:07:50,260 --> 02:07:51,080
I'll take that.

3484
02:07:51,200 --> 02:07:51,720
I'll take that.

3485
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:52,800
I'll take that.

3486
02:07:52,940 --> 02:07:53,360
That's fine.

3487
02:07:53,500 --> 02:07:54,000
I'll take it.

3488
02:07:57,180 --> 02:07:58,180
I'll take it, guys.

3489
02:07:58,320 --> 02:07:58,860
I'll take it.

3490
02:07:59,160 --> 02:08:00,180
He destroyed himself.

3491
02:08:03,680 --> 02:08:04,400
Oh, my God.

3492
02:08:04,420 --> 02:08:05,120
Where's the museum?

3493
02:08:05,700 --> 02:08:06,720
Where's the museum?

3494
02:08:06,840 --> 02:08:07,580
Where's the museum?

3495
02:08:07,580 --> 02:08:09,260
I don't know where the museum is.

3496
02:08:10,500 --> 02:08:11,100
Oh, my God.

3497
02:08:11,140 --> 02:08:13,080
There was a shortcut right here, and I didn't know.

3498
02:08:16,040 --> 02:08:17,700
Oh, my God!

3499
02:08:20,480 --> 02:08:24,420
I don't know where the museum is!

3500
02:08:31,140 --> 02:08:32,560
Oh, we made it!

3501
02:08:33,140 --> 02:08:33,880
Oh, we made it!

3502
02:08:34,360 --> 02:08:37,900
I never thought I'd say this, but I'm actually excited to be going to a museum.

3503
02:08:38,400 --> 02:08:39,820
I don't know the map!

3504
02:08:40,140 --> 02:08:41,280
I'm so confused!

3505
02:08:43,300 --> 02:08:44,360
Shiva H.

3506
02:08:44,420 --> 02:08:44,900
Vishnu!

3507
02:08:45,060 --> 02:08:47,040
The cola is dripping from that meteor!

3508
02:08:47,340 --> 02:08:47,620
What?

3509
02:08:52,960 --> 02:08:54,700
Wait, what the fuck?

3510
02:08:57,660 --> 02:08:58,980
Oh, my God!

3511
02:08:59,260 --> 02:08:59,820
He's alive!

3512
02:09:02,380 --> 02:09:03,440
Smart girl!

3513
02:09:07,960 --> 02:09:08,800
Huh?

3514
02:09:11,960 --> 02:09:12,700
Oh!

3515
02:09:13,740 --> 02:09:15,020
Oh, that's how it works?

3516
02:09:16,220 --> 02:09:17,980
Life always finds a way.

3517
02:09:18,400 --> 02:09:18,500
What did it?

3518
02:09:18,560 --> 02:09:21,520
We destroyed a priceless archeological artifact!

3519
02:09:22,340 --> 02:09:24,660
I mean, it's a Springfield, it could be fake!

3520
02:09:25,020 --> 02:09:27,820
Now, let's find out who's behind all this strange cola business.

3521
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:32,520
I know it's cliche, but...

3522
02:09:32,520 --> 02:09:33,620
My caramba!

3523
02:09:34,040 --> 02:09:34,560
Kodos!

3524
02:09:34,760 --> 02:09:37,400
Look at these space ratings for foolish Earthlings!

3525
02:09:37,700 --> 02:09:38,660
What happened, Kang?

3526
02:09:39,480 --> 02:09:43,140
Foolish Earthlings used to be the number one reality show in the galaxy!

3527
02:09:43,140 --> 02:09:45,040
Guys, I can't say kill up a girl, guys!

3528
02:09:45,300 --> 02:09:45,840
It's trading...

3529
02:09:45,840 --> 02:09:46,580
Ha ha ha!

3530
02:09:47,240 --> 02:09:47,920
Ha ha ha!

3531
02:09:48,120 --> 02:09:50,400
Our show is down in all key demos!

3532
02:09:50,720 --> 02:09:52,960
But our show concept was so perfect!

3533
02:09:53,480 --> 02:09:59,400
We film these idiotic bipeds with hidden cameras, and beam it into every television in the galaxy!

3534
02:09:59,620 --> 02:10:00,560
Come on, you knockers!

3535
02:10:01,180 --> 02:10:06,160
These aliens have been secretly filming an intergalactic reality show in Springfield!

3536
02:10:06,160 --> 02:10:07,960
I knew there was a simple explanation.

3537
02:10:08,340 --> 02:10:09,900
Oh, so that's what the bees were!

3538
02:10:10,340 --> 02:10:12,080
I would introduce an evil cola into the water supply!

3539
02:10:12,620 --> 02:10:14,020
People will go mad!

3540
02:10:14,640 --> 02:10:15,720
I like it!

3541
02:10:15,940 --> 02:10:19,420
Then we distribute laser guns at the Squidport tourist area!

3542
02:10:19,860 --> 02:10:21,000
I like it!

3543
02:10:21,240 --> 02:10:23,880
The cola maddened humans will go berserk!

3544
02:10:24,220 --> 02:10:25,300
I like it!

3545
02:10:25,420 --> 02:10:25,960
Ha ha ha!

3546
02:10:26,160 --> 02:10:26,960
I like it!

3547
02:10:26,980 --> 02:10:27,960
Destroying themselves and their town!

3548
02:10:28,600 --> 02:10:29,180
Delivering...

3549
02:10:29,180 --> 02:10:30,200
I like it!

3550
02:10:30,200 --> 02:10:30,260
I like it!

3551
02:10:30,580 --> 02:10:32,780
Ratings for foolish Earthlings!

3552
02:10:33,340 --> 02:10:34,640
Ha ha ha ha ha!

3553
02:10:35,120 --> 02:10:36,640
Oh, for the ratings!

3554
02:10:38,220 --> 02:10:43,080
You've got to prevent the aliens from putting laser guns in the hands of cola-drunk townspeople!

3555
02:10:43,660 --> 02:10:44,140
Why?

3556
02:10:44,280 --> 02:10:45,000
That sounds hilarious!

3557
02:10:45,080 --> 02:10:45,240
I know!

3558
02:10:45,420 --> 02:10:46,220
It sounds fun!

3559
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:47,820
I'll watch it!

3560
02:10:47,920 --> 02:10:49,000
You're a bad little boy!

3561
02:10:49,460 --> 02:10:50,540
Ha ha ha ha!

3562
02:10:51,200 --> 02:10:53,080
You're a bad little boy!

3563
02:10:53,240 --> 02:10:53,940
Shriva, bitch, Vishnu!

3564
02:10:54,200 --> 02:10:56,240
My humilation knows no bounds!

3565
02:10:56,460 --> 02:10:57,920
Alright, we're gonna call it here!

3566
02:10:58,920 --> 02:11:00,440
Oh my god, we actually...

3567
02:11:00,440 --> 02:11:01,000
You know, I...

3568
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:04,360
All I'm gonna say is I improved in smashing cars!

3569
02:11:04,360 --> 02:11:04,960
Guys!

3570
02:11:05,300 --> 02:11:07,280
I got better at smashy-smashy!

3571
02:11:07,580 --> 02:11:09,080
You have to admit that!

3572
02:11:10,480 --> 02:11:12,820
That is character development right there!

3573
02:11:13,220 --> 02:11:14,160
Ha ha ha ha!

3574
02:11:14,480 --> 02:11:14,880
I...

3575
02:11:14,880 --> 02:11:17,020
I improved in smashy-smashy!

3576
02:11:18,640 --> 02:11:19,620
Yes, I did!

3577
02:11:20,060 --> 02:11:20,400
Alright!

3578
02:11:20,640 --> 02:11:22,020
I'm gonna call it here, guys!

3579
02:11:22,160 --> 02:11:22,620
That's fun!

3580
02:11:22,860 --> 02:11:23,400
I had a lot of fun!

3581
02:11:23,560 --> 02:11:23,760
I don't know!

3582
02:11:23,760 --> 02:11:25,160
The Simpsons in the run was a lot...

3583
02:11:25,160 --> 02:11:29,440
Despite how much rage it induces in me, I do have a lot of fun with it!

3584
02:11:29,800 --> 02:11:30,200
Um...

3585
02:11:30,200 --> 02:11:31,420
I improved a lot!

3586
02:11:31,560 --> 02:11:33,860
There's been character development in my smashy-smashy!

3587
02:11:33,900 --> 02:11:36,460
I got better at car destruction!

3588
02:11:36,800 --> 02:11:37,160
Yippee!

3589
02:11:37,160 --> 02:11:38,540
That's always a good thing!

3590
02:11:39,100 --> 02:11:39,320
Um...

3591
02:11:39,320 --> 02:11:41,740
I'm gonna go visit Dad now after the stream!

3592
02:11:42,080 --> 02:11:42,300
But...

3593
02:11:42,300 --> 02:11:43,860
Thank you all for the well wishes today!

3594
02:11:44,080 --> 02:11:45,900
I really, really appreciate it, guys!

3595
02:11:46,440 --> 02:11:46,800
Um...

3596
02:11:46,800 --> 02:11:48,200
Thank you, everybody, for coming today!

3597
02:11:48,440 --> 02:11:49,300
And for watching me!

3598
02:11:49,540 --> 02:11:51,460
As always, everybody...

3599
02:11:51,460 --> 02:11:51,680
Um...

3600
02:11:51,680 --> 02:11:53,220
Sorry for, like, a quick abrupt ending!

3601
02:11:53,540 --> 02:11:55,340
Like, you know, I couldn't talk to you guys longer!

3602
02:11:55,520 --> 02:11:57,340
But that's why I did talk more in the beginning of the stream!

3603
02:11:58,040 --> 02:11:58,360
Um...

3604
02:11:58,360 --> 02:11:58,840
But, yes!

3605
02:11:58,920 --> 02:11:59,980
As always, everybody...

3606
02:11:59,980 --> 02:12:00,920
Stay hydrated!

3607
02:12:01,140 --> 02:12:01,540
Pause check!

3608
02:12:01,680 --> 02:12:02,300
Get up and move around!

3609
02:12:02,400 --> 02:12:03,280
To get that blood flowing!

3610
02:12:03,540 --> 02:12:04,860
And if you step from me...

3611
02:12:04,860 --> 02:12:05,440
Head to bed!

3612
02:12:05,700 --> 02:12:06,020
Cause...

3613
02:12:06,020 --> 02:12:06,860
You deserve it!

3614
02:12:06,960 --> 02:12:08,220
I'll see you guys next time, everybody!

3615
02:12:08,660 --> 02:12:09,180
Bye, guys!

3616
02:12:09,820 --> 02:12:10,140
Bye!
