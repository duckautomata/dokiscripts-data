1
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,800
Hello, everybody.

2
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,500
Oh, your Fugi's also in front of me.

3
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,920
I forgot to get rid of the Fugi.

4
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,500
Do I have one?

5
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,900
Yeah, you have like a little, like the spinning Fugi.

6
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,280
And like, she's literally right in front of you.

7
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,220
And she's just, it's like a little baby.

8
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,520
Like a little baby spinning in front of you right now.

9
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,160
Yay!

10
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:30,960
Let me get rid of her.

11
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:31,700
Sorry, guys.

12
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,200
We're gonna kill off Mini Doobie.

13
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,200
She's gone now.

14
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,000
She's gone.

15
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,680
We put her in the farm.

16
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,520
Oh, it's like you're gonna say fire.

17
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,800
Yes, the most horrific death you can do.

18
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,000
The most painful one.

19
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,560
Cast her into the pits of fire.

20
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,800
Hello, everybody.

21
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,320
Yes, hello, everyone.

22
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,740
Today, Doobie is gonna be teaching me a CS.

23
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,480
My worst genre when it comes to shooters.

24
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,500
Oh, have you played before?

25
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,780
Apparently, I'm private rank 4.

26
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,460
So, I... technically, I have.

27
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,400
But it was when... not CS2.

28
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,400
I don't think I've touched CS2.

29
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,840
I've touched CSGO.

30
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,100
And...

31
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:24,300
Yeah.

32
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,060
But, so, I don't know how...

33
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,140
Does it like transfer over?

34
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,500
Like your previous stuff?

35
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:28,960
Yeah.

36
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,840
Oh, okay.

37
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,100
Yeah, it's pretty much...

38
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,600
It's like how Overwatch got rid of Overwatch 1.

39
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:33,920
Yeah.

40
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:34,900
And Overwatch 2.

41
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:35,520
Oh, yeah.

42
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,180
And then you keep your rank and everything.

43
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,020
Oh, okay.

44
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,040
That makes sense.

45
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:39,460
And everything.

46
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,460
It's actually...

47
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,300
They're pretty similar.

48
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,320
Yeah, because like I heard like...

49
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,660
That's why people were opening so many knives back then for CS...

50
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,200
CSGO.

51
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,000
Because it was like the knife stock market.

52
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,560
So, everybody thought that knife prices were gonna go up and stuff when CS2.

53
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,820
When CS2, so...

54
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,380
Yeah, so, it's sort of like a stock market for me.

55
00:06:59,280 --> 00:06:59,680
Like...

56
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:00,760
Yeah.

57
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,120
Yeah, some people will play and get their two cases.

58
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,240
And then from that, some cases go for like...

59
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,300
$17 now, so...

60
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:09,780
Jesus.

61
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:10,860
Oh, my God.

62
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:14,700
I remember I asked you how much you spent on cases alone.

63
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:16,760
I...

64
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,120
No, because I have cases.

65
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,120
Like a bunch of cases saved up over the years.

66
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,560
So, I haven't spent too much.

67
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,520
Oh, you haven't spent...

68
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:22,660
Oh, wait.

69
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,760
But how much have you spent?

70
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,720
Also, you're...

71
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,660
The...

72
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,900
The chroma mask is not working very well...

73
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,200
Because your tongue is transparent.

74
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,640
Let me fix that.

75
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,000
Sorry.

76
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,700
That's a weird color, too.

77
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,120
Okay, I fixed it.

78
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,720
Yeah, I forgot you picked red.

79
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,340
I have green.

80
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,040
I have blue.

81
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:41,740
It's typical.

82
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:42,900
Oh, it's the keys?

83
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,360
Oh, I forgot.

84
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,520
Like...

85
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,020
For CS2, you have to buy keys.

86
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:47,920
Not cases.

87
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,540
Yeah, yeah.

88
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,400
Keys and cases.

89
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,200
You have to buy both.

90
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,400
Yeah, I don't really follow...

91
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,760
I think, like...

92
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,880
I remember when CS was super...

93
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,220
CSGO was super duper popular back then.

94
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,660
And, like, everybody was just doing case openings.

95
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,840
And, like...

96
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,760
Like, it was just an entire...

97
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,600
Like, VOD just dedicated it to opening cases and stuff.

98
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,280
Because, like, knives can go for, like, thousands of dollars.

99
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:12,500
Wait.

100
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,600
What's your most expensive knife, Doobie?

101
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,820
Oh, I only have one knife.

102
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,100
So, that's my most expensive knife.

103
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:18,280
Oh.

104
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,160
Yes.

105
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,420
Wait.

106
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,880
How expensive is it?

107
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,380
It's probably, like, maybe...

108
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,420
80 bucks.

109
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,840
Is it because it's, like...

110
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,860
It's really low.

111
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,960
Is it because it's, like, super...

112
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,900
I know, like, they have, like, grade and stuff with the knives.

113
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,180
Like, when it's, like, super worn.

114
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,560
Or, like, super used or something.

115
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,040
Is that...

116
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:40,440
Yeah.

117
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:40,740
Yeah.

118
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,720
It's also just the pattern.

119
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,320
Because it's just the safari mesh.

120
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:44,620
Oh.

121
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,740
So, yeah.

122
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,040
It's pretty ugly.

123
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,280
But it's...

124
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:49,980
Oh, okay.

125
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,960
It's 200 bucks.

126
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:52,440
That's pretty good.

127
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:52,760
Oh, I mean.

128
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,760
That's better than 80.

129
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,020
That's better than 80.

130
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:55,920
Yeah.

131
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,560
But, yes.

132
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,600
Doobie's gonna teach me all about CS in general.

133
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,180
Like, UTIL, NAE, lineups.

134
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:08,460
The...

135
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,540
What was it?

136
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,080
Like, when you crouch next to the other person.

137
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,420
The other person jumps on you.

138
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,480
And then you push them up towards high ground.

139
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,760
And that's the only thing I can remember.

140
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:18,620
Oh, yeah.

141
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,440
The boosting.

142
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,400
Yeah, the boosting.

143
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:20,920
Yeah, yeah.

144
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,660
I remember when CSGO was, like, the peak of CSGO.

145
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,460
And, like, everybody was streaming on that on Twitch back then.

146
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:31,980
Um, that was the one thing I, like, picked up on.

147
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,220
The boost.

148
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:40,060
If you boost, I feel like most of the time you just end up dying.

149
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,000
Wait, really?

150
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,400
Then what the fuck's the point?

151
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,380
Like, it just looks cool, I guess.

152
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:44,780
It works sometimes.

153
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:45,780
Yeah.

154
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,020
It just looks cool.

155
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,000
It does.

156
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:49,540
It does.

157
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:55,460
Yeah, but, yeah, I'm looking forward to Doobie teaching me, uh, CS2.

158
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,920
And then, like, when we both get too tilted, we can play Overwatch later.

159
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,400
Yeah, that'll cure us.

160
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:02,940
Yeah, yeah.

161
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,080
We go from one poison to the next.

162
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,220
It's, like, you go from, from smoking to drinking.

163
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,980
Like, we were playing...

164
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,900
Wait, no, we're playing something specific in Overwatch, though, right?

165
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:18,500
Yeah, Stadium.

166
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,140
That's better.

167
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,420
It's a little, it's a little better.

168
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,980
So, it's, like, from, uh, smoking to maybe caffeine, I guess.

169
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,100
Oh, okay.

170
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,960
Wait, so, wait, what is Stadium?

171
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,040
I guess I've never, I've never played it.

172
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,280
Yeah, okay, so you never played, uh, Stadium.

173
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,740
Okay, Stadium, you know, it's basically, like, what if they made Overwatch a MOBA?

174
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,560
But, like, without, like, the top-downs.

175
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:49,700
It's still a hero shooter, but, like, so, like, you're sent into, like, mini fights, like, mini battles, but it's still the same map.

176
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,360
It's just, like, miniaturized it.

177
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,740
And then, like, each...

178
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:57,060
And there's, like, you have to win, I think, like, four rounds.

179
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,740
But each round, you get to upgrade your character.

180
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,160
So, there's some, like, inc...

181
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,280
Oh, it's just paladins.

182
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,560
Apparently, it's just paladins.

183
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,100
I forgot.

184
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,780
Like, I've only played paladins.

185
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,820
I like paladins at once.

186
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,020
Yeah.

187
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,240
Yeah, I forgot about paladins.

188
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:18,200
But it's basically paladins, and there's some really fucking crazy builds you can do.

189
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,020
So, Mora could, like, throw, like, three orbs at once.

190
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:31,620
And then, like, Reinhardt could do a thing where he fire strikes and then leaves, like, a pool of lava behind the fire strike.

191
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,840
That'll damage you.

192
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,860
Like, it's, like, there's, like, lots of crazy shit you can do.

193
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:36,640
And then...

194
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,160
Trail trail?

195
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:37,760
Okay, got it.

196
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:43,460
Yeah, and then there was one where Ash can send out, like, a fucking tiny baby bob.

197
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:48,740
Like, it's, like, a tiny miniature-sized baby bob.

198
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,920
So, like, the hitbox is smaller.

199
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,520
But there's, like, so much crazy stuff.

200
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,460
Like, it's actually really, really fun.

201
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,220
And the rounds are, like, really short.

202
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,740
So, it's not like you're being held hostage in general.

203
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:07,160
And even when you're losing, you can still turn it around because it depends on what you're building type deal.

204
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:11,480
So, you could just, you know, just lose to far more points to build a better character.

205
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:12,860
So...

206
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:13,980
Okay.

207
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:24,540
Yeah, so I think you'll have a lot of fun because, like, it's actually so much fun, more fun than, like, regular Overwatch, which is, like, an accomplishment.

208
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,840
No, it does...

209
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,660
Because, yeah, the combination of different stuff sounds cool.

210
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,560
Yeah, like, just, like...

211
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,240
I'm excited!

212
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,580
Yeah, me too!

213
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,260
Alright, so...

214
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,740
I think you have to just add me.

215
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,380
And, like, invite me to a...

216
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,100
I don't even know how...

217
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,580
I think this is, like, the first time I've ever booted a CS2.

218
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,020
Yeah, I'll send you an invite when you watch it.

219
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:50,340
Yeah, yeah.

220
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,660
Wait, I'm already in.

221
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,580
Oh, do I have to be, like, appear online?

222
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,720
Like, mine's a...

223
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,260
You know, like, it hides my game status with what I'm doing?

224
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,020
Oh, yeah.

225
00:12:59,320 --> 00:12:59,480
Yeah.

226
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:00,160
Alright.

227
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,300
Yeah, I got it.

228
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,360
I got Green Sonic's invite.

229
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,360
Okay.

230
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,720
I think we can play...

231
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,460
Well, I'll show you, like, one map specifically.

232
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,860
And then we'll just...

233
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:12,060
Is it dust?

234
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,180
...on that...

235
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:13,520
Yeah.

236
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,120
It's...

237
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,480
It's always dust.

238
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:18,740
Yeah.

239
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,780
Alright, let me boost up Doobie's volume a little bit.

240
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:24,920
I hope everybody...

241
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,000
I hope Doobie...

242
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,720
Mic check.

243
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:27,780
One, two, three.

244
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,780
Mic check.

245
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,060
Choo-choo.

246
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,740
Alright, that was really loud.

247
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:37,960
Alright.

248
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,220
My game crashed.

249
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,720
Oh, yeah.

250
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,400
I was like, boy, she disappeared.

251
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,480
Why didn't...

252
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:45,820
What the heck?

253
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,460
Even the game was like...

254
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,160
I haven't had it crashed.

255
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,980
The game was like, just play Overwatch.

256
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:53,960
Not yet.

257
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,840
I was just playing, so it was fine.

258
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:57,520
I don't know.

259
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,760
You disappeared.

260
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,500
It's not Tuesday.

261
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,980
It's not Steam.

262
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,380
It's not Tuesday, ain't it?

263
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,500
It's not Steam.

264
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,620
Oh, the, uh...

265
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,200
Yeah, the Steam.

266
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,100
Is that the Steam maintenance day?

267
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,480
Yeah, the Steam maintenance day.

268
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,700
Oh, I know.

269
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,800
My whole computer is...

270
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,140
Wait.

271
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:15,780
Uh...

272
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,080
What?

273
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,660
Hold on, it's like frozen.

274
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,720
What the?

275
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:21,820
Oh, my God.

276
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,360
That's not good.

277
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,160
My computer just blue screened.

278
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:26,660
Oh, wait.

279
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,560
Oh, my God.

280
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,020
Wait, it's Friday the 13th.

281
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,080
Oh, my God.

282
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:31,960
Fuck.

283
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,260
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

284
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,220
Oh, man.

285
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,600
Friday the 13th.

286
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,720
Hold on, it's restarting.

287
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,020
Okay.

288
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,080
Do you do a dual PC setup?

289
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:41,700
Yeah.

290
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,100
Oh, that's smart.

291
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:43,920
That's smart.

292
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,580
I put all my gambling on one.

293
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,660
No, I have one.

294
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,060
I put it all on one PC.

295
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,880
I know that's, like, really fucking stupid to do.

296
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,260
Like, I'm like...

297
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,540
But, I...

298
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,100
It's just...

299
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:56,680
It's easier.

300
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,900
It is easier, because it's, like, you know, with one...

301
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,220
It doesn't, like, lag as much, too.

302
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:07,440
Like, you don't put too much strain on your PC when it comes to streaming and gaming at the same time.

303
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:16,000
Like, I can feel, like, my room, my office is basically, like, a green room.

304
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,340
But, like...

305
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,040
Well, not even a green room.

306
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,500
It's, like, there's no...

307
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,080
It's the opposite of a green room.

308
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,860
There's no windows in my office.

309
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:30,720
So, like, I have to put the air conditioning, like, really, really cold.

310
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,680
Because if I don't, it's, like...

311
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,820
It's basically, like, a fucking sauna in my office.

312
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,180
Because there's no windows.

313
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,920
Yeah, I was gonna say, at least in the winter, you have a personal heater.

314
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:40,240
Yes.

315
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:43,360
No, in the winter, I have to turn on the...

316
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,720
I have to turn on air conditioning.

317
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,280
No, it's too hot.

318
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,820
Because it's a hot box.

319
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:50,860
Because I went from...

320
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:54,840
The only reason why I picked this room as my office is because...

321
00:15:54,860 --> 00:16:00,320
Before I moved, my other office, my old office, was the greenhouse.

322
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,520
So, like...

323
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:05,900
But it had, like, three of the walls were just giant balcony windows.

324
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,560
Where it goes from, like, almost to the floor to the top of the ceiling.

325
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:15,020
So, then the sun was just shining right into my office every time I stream in the morning.

326
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,040
And then...

327
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,720
So, then I was, like, never again.

328
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,460
So, then I ended up choosing...

329
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,660
Yeah, it gets in your face, right?

330
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,280
Like, the sun.

331
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,540
Yeah, and it gets really fucking hot, too.

332
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,240
So, I was, like, never again.

333
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,380
And then I went from one extreme to the next.

334
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,080
And have no windows now.

335
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:32,420
Alright.

336
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,480
I'm in.

337
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,020
Yeah, you lock yourself in.

338
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:35,900
It's like a padded room.

339
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:36,700
Yeah.

340
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,100
Alright, that's two.

341
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,680
Force yourself to stream, you know?

342
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,500
Yeah, exactly.

343
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,320
Alright.

344
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,260
Good old...

345
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:44,420
Okay.

346
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,620
Vitamin D.

347
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:46,700
Alright.

348
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,260
I'm compiling shaders.

349
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:49,940
Okay.

350
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:50,720
Alright.

351
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,800
I guess I'll be counter-terrorist.

352
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,160
Oh, my God.

353
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,620
This crosshair sucks.

354
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,980
Okay, give me an idea of fixing my crosshair.

355
00:16:59,260 --> 00:16:59,540
Oh.

356
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,520
There's, like, follow recoil.

357
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,880
Some people are, like...

358
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,060
What?

359
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:03,740
They really hate it.

360
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,740
But then other times, they're, like, oh, it's...

361
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,460
It's really good.

362
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,140
So, I don't know.

363
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,340
It's a preference, you know?

364
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,340
Follow recoil?

365
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,180
What does that do?

366
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:13,940
Oh, um...

367
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:17,500
It, like, bounces in response to how the gun is recoiling.

368
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,920
So, each gun has a specific spray pattern.

369
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,000
Oh, I see.

370
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:21,720
I noticed it.

371
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,740
So, it just does a little bounce.

372
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,500
I don't like that.

373
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,960
That throws me out.

374
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:26,100
Yeah, yeah.

375
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,180
Oh, wait.

376
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,400
No, it still does the bounce.

377
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:31,500
Uh...

378
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:31,840
Oh.

379
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,480
Oh, I just did friendly...

380
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,160
Oh, I turn off friendly fire.

381
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,880
Or, like, turn...

382
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,720
Off the notification for it.

383
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,540
Okay, there you go.

384
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:42,620
What?

385
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,060
Why does it still bounce?

386
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,040
Oh.

387
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,100
Oh, wait.

388
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,140
Oh, it's because of my recoil.

389
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,060
I'm so scared.

390
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,320
I figured it out.

391
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:55,160
No, if you turn off recoil bounce, it shouldn't...

392
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,980
Like, the crosshair itself shouldn't move.

393
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,120
But your gun will...

394
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:58,820
Yeah, yeah.

395
00:17:58,940 --> 00:17:59,900
It's my gun moving.

396
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,220
It's my gun moving.

397
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,760
I'm so not used to this.

398
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,420
Oh, my God.

399
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,300
I'm so...

400
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,700
I'm just, like...

401
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,620
Oh, my God.

402
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,780
We did this collab because you were watching...

403
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,740
You were watching me play with, uh...

404
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,340
Remia, right?

405
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,240
Oh, yeah.

406
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:14,900
I was...

407
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:15,800
Because we...

408
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,880
We talked about it in our last collab.

409
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,660
Oh, you're teaching me CS.

410
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:20,700
But then, like...

411
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,440
Oh, that's true.

412
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:21,880
Yeah, yeah.

413
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:22,460
So, then...

414
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,380
And then, like...

415
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:23,940
Our skip...

416
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:24,400
Like, you know...

417
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,380
We've both been super duper busy.

418
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:27,920
Yeah.

419
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:28,500
Yeah.

420
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,320
Oh.

421
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,480
Oh, yeah.

422
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,620
We were talking in chat.

423
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,620
Because you told about how you knew Adept.

424
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,480
Oh, yeah.

425
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,000
Yeah, yeah.

426
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:37,640
So...

427
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,800
Doobie and I...

428
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,720
I found out from...

429
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,440
From that last stream.

430
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,420
Um...

431
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,320
I also used to know Adept, too.

432
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,340
Oh.

433
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,780
And back in the Overwatch days...

434
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,320
Oh, wait.

435
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,420
I need to bring my game down a little bit first before I keep going.

436
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,880
Like, um...

437
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,600
And...

438
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,720
So, she...

439
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,080
Doobie was talking about...

440
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,440
Um...

441
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,060
How she tried to start a female Overwatch team.

442
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,040
And Adept was in it.

443
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,440
And the thing is...

444
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,820
I know about that Overwatch team.

445
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,000
Because...

446
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,260
Yeah, that's crazy.

447
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:21,420
Because...

448
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,280
We...

449
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:22,740
I...

450
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,640
Um...

451
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,200
Because...

452
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,280
I think...

453
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,260
It might have been you that approached me to join that team.

454
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,240
In the book for a time.

455
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,380
I got two DMs about this team.

456
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,140
And one of them was Adept.

457
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,420
So, I don't know if the other one was you.

458
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:07,580
Uh...

459
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:07,880
I don't...

460
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,800
I don't think so.

461
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,700
Because I was not, like, super social.

462
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,340
I just...

463
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:11,680
I don't know.

464
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,240
Yeah.

465
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,140
I don't think I directly approached people.

466
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,800
Like, they were the ones who were just kind of...

467
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,160
Took it over, in a sense.

468
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:17,360
Yeah.

469
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,340
Like, I just kind of started it.

470
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,000
Yeah.

471
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:19,860
So...

472
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,360
The thing is, like...

473
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:22,980
Um...

474
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,540
I got recruited to Doobie's team.

475
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:26,620
I said no.

476
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,100
So, we almost...

477
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,840
We almost played together.

478
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,280
I said no.

479
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,440
Because I...

480
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,860
I'm sorry, Doobie.

481
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:41,020
I did not want to join an all-female Overwatch team.

482
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:41,720
That's fine.

483
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,700
I wasn't even that serious about it.

484
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,900
I was just looking for something to do, you know?

485
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,040
And then I completely forgot about it.

486
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,360
Like, I didn't even...

487
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,100
Yeah.

488
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,620
Oh my god.

489
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,900
I didn't even think about it anymore after a while.

490
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,880
Like, I kind of just forgot about it, so...

491
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,360
That was crazy.

492
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,600
Like, when I heard about that, I was like, No way.

493
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:05,780
That team?

494
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,320
Because it was, like...

495
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,900
Sort of, like...

496
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,600
Not well infamous, I would say.

497
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,680
That's the word.

498
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,380
In the Overwatch Tier 2 scene.

499
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,960
Because it was the first all-female Tier 2 Overwatch team at that time.

500
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:20,580
Really?

501
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,620
Yeah, it was.

502
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,200
It was.

503
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:22,940
Because, like...

504
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:23,720
I know...

505
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,460
I knew all the girls that were in it.

506
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,080
And then...

507
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,160
But did you tell more, Laura, about that team?

508
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,100
Or am I allowed to tell them?

509
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:31,480
No.

510
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,340
No, I don't...

511
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:37,000
I honestly don't even remember because my brain went somewhere else after that.

512
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:45,120
So, that team was sort of infamous in the Overwatch Tier 2 scene.

513
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,960
Because I was also doing Tier 2 Overwatch at that point.

514
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,480
And I was actually...

515
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,860
You get your team trying to recruit me and my other friend for your team.

516
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,180
And the thing is that we were already in a team together.

517
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,780
But it was, like, a mixed team.

518
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:00,980
So, we're like, oh, yeah.

519
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:05,060
Like, we'd rather stay in our mixed team than join the all-female team.

520
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:11,580
And then I remember, because it was low-key drama at that time.

521
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:14,100
Because, you know, like, the Tier 2 scene was, like, a lot...

522
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,420
You know, like, in general, the Tier 2 competitive scene, there's always drama.

523
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:20,480
And I remember, like, three of your girls...

524
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:26,700
Like, one girl, like, left and then poached two other girls on your team to form a new team.

525
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,200
And I remember that.

526
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:29,840
Yeah, I don't even know.

527
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,580
I don't remember anything like that.

528
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,820
But I believe you.

529
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,100
Because that's why I remember that.

530
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,620
And then I remember that situation.

531
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,220
Because people were, like...

532
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,480
Because I remember, because, like...

533
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:50,980
I think it was either Banff or Adept that were complaining about it to other people.

534
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,540
So that's why I heard about it.

535
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:00,180
That is pretty crazy to think about, though.

536
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:00,480
Yeah.

537
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,480
We were so close to knowing each other for a long time.

538
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,000
Yeah, we almost knew each other then.

539
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,060
I thought it was crazy.

540
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,040
I was like, wait, what?

541
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,180
You were on that team?

542
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,220
I was like, holy shit.

543
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,160
When I realized you were watching that stream.

544
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,200
Because I was, like...

545
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,780
I think I used the wrong words for it.

546
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:24,500
We were comparing, like, Marvel Rivals and Counter-Strike.

547
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,680
Like, competitive.

548
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,180
Like, pro scene, I guess.

549
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:27,540
Yeah.

550
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,120
And I think there is really high-level Marvel Rivals play, obviously.

551
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,060
But I think I just worded it wrong.

552
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,000
And I was thinking...

553
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,520
I was like, shoot, Doki was watching that.

554
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,780
I didn't mean it like that.

555
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,760
It's just like...

556
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,880
For Marvel!

557
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:41,720
It's so cute.

558
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,880
It's like a lot of unpredictability, right?

559
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,380
With, like...

560
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:44,820
Oh, there is.

561
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:49,080
Because, like, Marvel Rivals rely more on, like, ability...

562
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:49,620
It's like Overwatch.

563
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:52,380
It relies more on, like, abilities and, like...

564
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,000
Yeah.

565
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,460
And, like, alt coordination.

566
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,140
And it's like whoever...

567
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:56,340
Yeah.

568
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,480
Whoever, like, does the better...

569
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,420
And, like...

570
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,880
Okay, the thing I don't like...

571
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,140
Not don't like about Marvel Rivals competitive...

572
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,540
But it's very different from Overwatch competitive...

573
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:08,520
Is that in Marvel Rivals, it's a rock-paper-scissors.

574
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,220
Because it's a banline.

575
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,140
Because Overwatch doesn't have a banline.

576
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:16,240
So, like, it's whichever team does the better banline...

577
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,160
That can fuck over the other team.

578
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,300
Because, you know...

579
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,260
Because, like...

580
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,500
It's all about counterpicking.

581
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,240
But there's also, like, rock-paper-scissors as well.

582
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:25,860
Because, like...

583
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:29,240
If they have a better bandline, then the other team is more fucked.

584
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:37,260
Because they might have a bandline where it makes them play worse compared to the usual.

585
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:41,640
Because their DPS players might be on characters that they're not the best at.

586
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:42,860
And stuff like that.

587
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:46,220
But I heard Overwatch has bandlines now too.

588
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,740
Because they're like, oh shit, it's working now.

589
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,480
They saw a rival...

590
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,060
Because Marvel Rivals is an Overwatch competitor now.

591
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,640
So they're now like trying...

592
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,040
They're both like copying each other on what to do.

593
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,060
To have a bigger player base.

594
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,100
Oh, yeah, yeah, that makes sense.

595
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:04,800
Yeah.

596
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,240
I was gonna say something, but I forgot.

597
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:08,920
Oh.

598
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,400
Alright, teach me.

599
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,340
Oh, okay.

600
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:13,820
Okay.

601
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:15,660
Um...

602
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,820
Wait, let's wait until the next round.

603
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:17,640
Oh, okay.

604
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,620
Just make sure to buy smoke.

605
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,560
Make sure to buy smoke.

606
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:23,260
No, I deserve it.

607
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:23,580
I mean...

608
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,120
No, I deserve it.

609
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:24,420
I mean...

610
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:24,800
Yeah, we...

611
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,940
Well, it's faster.

612
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:30,720
Wait, then we can just kill each other now.

613
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:31,460
Okay.

614
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:32,580
I'll buy a smoke.

615
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,460
Buy a smoke and a M4.

616
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:36,280
M4?

617
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,700
The fuck is an M4?

618
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,280
Oh, well, you'll see it in the buy menu.

619
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,020
It's like, you've played Valorant before, right?

620
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,260
Barely.

621
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,020
I do not retain any information.

622
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:49,600
Oh.

623
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,500
You know how to open the buy menu, right?

624
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,780
Yeah, I know how to open the buy menu.

625
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,700
I bought the smoke.

626
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,000
I'm like, where the fuck is...

627
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,260
Which...

628
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,660
Isn't the rifles mid-tier?

629
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:57,740
Or...

630
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:57,920
Yeah.

631
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:58,820
Uh...

632
00:25:58,820 --> 00:25:59,900
It should be the far right.

633
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:00,840
The far?

634
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:01,160
Oh.

635
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,300
Second row, I think.

636
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:03,960
Or something like that.

637
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,640
I didn't get it.

638
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:06,800
Oh, that's okay.

639
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:07,240
Here.

640
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,200
Oh, nice.

641
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:08,600
Take that.

642
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:09,200
Okay.

643
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,980
Well, first, we gotta do this kind of fast.

644
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,520
So, this is CT spawns.

645
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:12,600
Yeah.

646
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,580
So, you're a counter-terrorist.

647
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:14,360
Yeah.

648
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,240
And then, everybody spawns here.

649
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,300
And people split off.

650
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,400
So, there's like, five people.

651
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,400
So, this is mid-doors, right here.

652
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:20,760
Yeah.

653
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,080
So, you can see up...

654
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:26,280
Oh, like, if you back up a bit, people will hold right here.

655
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,440
And you can see up...

656
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:28,940
Up until the top of mid.

657
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,480
Oh, yeah.

658
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,100
Yeah, yeah.

659
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,260
And this is where the opera usually go.

660
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:32,800
Yeah.

661
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,460
Yeah, yeah.

662
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,660
That's called suicide, because if you...

663
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,340
I'm sending an instant headshot.

664
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:39,380
Yeah.

665
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:39,640
Yeah.

666
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:39,880
Yeah, yeah.

667
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,300
So, this is lower tons over here.

668
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,380
So, this goes over to B.

669
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:44,500
Okay.

670
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,960
And then, over here, this is called Xbox.

671
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,420
I'm not sure why it's called Xbox.

672
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,020
I guess this is green and it's a box.

673
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:51,540
This is called Xbox.

674
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,080
Oh, I guess so.

675
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,640
And you can do like a little jump and if you crouch...

676
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:54,940
Oh, nice.

677
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:55,400
Yeah.

678
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:55,760
Yeah.

679
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,660
And then, this is cat, but sometimes people call it short.

680
00:26:59,020 --> 00:26:59,360
Uh-huh.

681
00:26:59,360 --> 00:26:59,440
Uh-huh.

682
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:02,320
And...

683
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:02,660
Uh...

684
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,430
Yeah, I'm just teaching the call-outs because a lot of times...

685
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:05,520
Um...

686
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,200
People are just communicating like, oh, they're cat, they're short, they're long.

687
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:08,620
Yeah.

688
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,220
But...

689
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,260
Like, you don't really know.

690
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,360
But, uh...

691
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:11,680
It's pretty...

692
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,660
I feel like this map is pretty self-explanatory.

693
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:14,120
So, it's long.

694
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,760
Yeah, I mean, it basically is...

695
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,360
It doesn't...

696
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,440
It didn't change much from CSGO, right?

697
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,460
No, not really.

698
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,620
No, I don't think so.

699
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,700
And then, this is pit.

700
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:23,460
Oh.

701
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:23,540
Okay.

702
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:24,980
Yeah.

703
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:26,200
Oh.

704
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,020
Okay, we don't have time here.

705
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,020
Kill me with your...

706
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:29,260
Okay.

707
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:31,540
With the AK.

708
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:31,960
No, with the AK.

709
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:32,540
Okay.

710
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:35,820
That works.

711
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:36,320
That works.

712
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,200
I can't...

713
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,180
I don't wanna waste my bullet.

714
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:41,300
Oh.

715
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,180
You'll get it back.

716
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:43,780
Okay.

717
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,700
Wait, there's a second page for a rifle?

718
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:47,980
What?

719
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:48,520
Oh, wait, no.

720
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:48,920
I see it.

721
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:49,740
Oh, I see it.

722
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:50,840
M4A1.

723
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,680
I just can't read.

724
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:52,660
I got it.

725
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,300
Alright, so come up mid and meet me in suicide.

726
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:56,880
Okay.

727
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:00,900
Alright, I'm here.

728
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,800
Alright, come all the way up here.

729
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,020
And then, uh...

730
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:05,340
Yeah?

731
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,800
Let me show you some smokes, I guess.

732
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,960
I'll show you a smoke.

733
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:09,400
Alright.

734
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,000
I only know one.

735
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:10,700
Oh, wait.

736
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:11,680
What?

737
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,700
What do you mean you don't need a one?

738
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:14,840
Okay, you know that...

739
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,680
There's no...

740
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,340
I mean, you can use your smoke.

741
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,740
Okay, I know two smokes, but...

742
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,000
Oh, yeah.

743
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,260
So, pretty much, um...

744
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,440
You're gonna stand in this corner.

745
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,180
Yeah?

746
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,720
And then, you're gonna line up your crosshair.

747
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:26,300
There's like a...

748
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,120
You see the shadow?

749
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,120
Which one?

750
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,200
There's like a shadow right, uh...

751
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:29,560
Right here.

752
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:31,760
What?

753
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,700
It's like a shadow on the building.

754
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,540
Oh, okay.

755
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,480
So, just like the...

756
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,200
The...

757
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,380
The indent between...

758
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,760
Yeah, but do it above.

759
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,020
So, like where I'm shooting.

760
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,000
So, like put your crosshair right up...

761
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:44,980
Up above.

762
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:45,740
Like at the corner?

763
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,540
On your crosshair's...

764
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,580
Yeah, yeah.

765
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,000
Okay, okay.

766
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:48,720
Above the corner.

767
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,280
Above the corner, okay.

768
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:51,440
Yeah.

769
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,340
And then...

770
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:54,820
Jump and throw your smoke at the same time.

771
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,160
Okay.

772
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:57,540
Oh.

773
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,460
That's okay, that's okay.

774
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,620
Here, here, here.

775
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:01,460
Okay, okay.

776
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,260
That's a...

777
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:03,800
It's just...

778
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,340
Test run.

779
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,300
It's a test run.

780
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,240
Yeah, yeah.

781
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:06,960
It's a test run.

782
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:07,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

783
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,380
Okay.

784
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:13,560
When you spawn on T spawn, you're going to want to throw that smoke pretty...

785
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,680
Somebody on the team will probably be able to do it, but this is just like an example.

786
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,000
Someone else will smoke for me.

787
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,180
I'm not the smoker.

788
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,600
Someone else can smoke.

789
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,180
It takes a while.

790
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:27,680
So now, like, say you're on T, there's somebody watching mid-doors, so you can go cat now.

791
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,660
Because it's smoked off, right?

792
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:29,200
Yeah.

793
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,420
Yeah, and then you can push.

794
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,700
Oh, so you smoke the off-road, I see.

795
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

796
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,420
And then you can use smokes, like, anywhere pretty much.

797
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:38,780
Yeah.

798
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:39,960
We'll just quickly go to B.

799
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,220
This is, like, lower tons to upper tons.

800
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,180
Uh-huh.

801
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,360
And that's T spawn over there, and then...

802
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:46,680
Okay.

803
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,060
B site is here.

804
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:49,880
Okay.

805
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,380
Wait, do you not bunny hop?

806
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,480
Oh, uh, I don't think so, maybe.

807
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,440
Not really.

808
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,260
They changed it, it used to be easier.

809
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,500
Oh, okay, I was gonna say.

810
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,120
I know, like, oh my...

811
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:13,380
I didn't know you played Cheetah's Cheetah, or Cheetah, the one where, like, you're a bunch of cheetahs, and then they all have aimbot, and aimbot, and hacking.

812
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:17,660
And then, like, so I had, like, a bunch of dragoons joining me for it.

813
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:22,880
And then there was, like, two people that knew how to B-hop, and, like, they were so fucking fast.

814
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,380
It's like, oh, it's so easy!

815
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,240
Joki, it's so, look at me!

816
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:29,060
Oh, it's called Cheetahs, because it's like...

817
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:29,640
Yeah, you're cheap.

818
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:30,240
Yeah.

819
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:33,580
Cheetah...

820
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,280
I haven't played it.

821
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:35,840
It's me!

822
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:40,880
Yeah, so, like, you could tell who played CS when we were playing that game.

823
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,720
I still have trauma from it.

824
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:47,360
What people do is they bind jump to, like, scroll wheel, and then...

825
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:47,840
Oh, that makes sense.

826
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,520
It's just, like, brrrrrr.

827
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,680
It's just, like, Apex.

828
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,220
That makes sense.

829
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,100
Oh, I forgot to buy it.

830
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:52,940
Oh, never mind.

831
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:53,760
I didn't buy a smoke.

832
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,300
It's okay.

833
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,440
All right, so, well, I'll show you a spray pattern.

834
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,000
Oh, wait.

835
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,820
Actually, it's the same spray pattern, really.

836
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,800
So, I'll just use this, like, we can sh...

837
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,320
Uh, hold on.

838
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:02,720
Don't shoot me.

839
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:03,360
Okay.

840
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,260
We'll stand here, and then just hold.

841
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:07,980
Is it a tap, though?

842
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,120
And don't... don't move the gun, like, while you're, uh...

843
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:12,280
Yeah.

844
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,940
So, just so you can see the spray pattern.

845
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:14,320
Jesus.

846
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,260
See how it goes?

847
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:15,980
Yeah.

848
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:16,840
Yeah.

849
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,060
Yeah.

850
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,280
Yeah, that's how you usually tap, right?

851
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,080
So, what people do is they go...

852
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:25,760
Yeah, you usually one-tap, or you, uh, pull down and to the left.

853
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,500
So, like, try pulling down and to the left.

854
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:31,360
Yeah, it's, like, a little bit more stable.

855
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:31,740
Yeah.

856
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,640
All right, so, let's do...

857
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,620
We'll do a target practice.

858
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:36,620
Uh, you...

859
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,280
Here, I'll...

860
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,780
Oh, I'll stand over here.

861
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,220
Okay.

862
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:41,060
And then, yeah, you can shoot me now.

863
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:42,680
Okay.

864
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:43,220
No!

865
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:43,820
Yay!

866
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:45,740
No!

867
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,920
I thought you were gonna practice the spray pattern.

868
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,380
Just one-tap, you need.

869
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:51,060
I...

870
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:51,300
I...

871
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,580
My crosshair was just on your head.

872
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:54,580
I...

873
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,400
Buy an...

874
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:55,960
Buy an AWP.

875
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:56,420
Buy an AWP.

876
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,220
An AWP, okay.

877
00:31:59,400 --> 00:31:59,760
Okay.

878
00:31:59,760 --> 00:31:59,880
Do you know what?

879
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,620
You don't snipe?

880
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:01,940
Oh, man.

881
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,840
No, I'm so bad at sniping.

882
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,140
I'm really fucking bad at sniping.

883
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:06,880
Okay.

884
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:07,620
Okay.

885
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,300
But, like, AWP is, like, supposedly very easy.

886
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,300
Because it's, like, one-shot.

887
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,000
Yeah.

888
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,380
It's, like, one-shot body-shot.

889
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:14,800
It is really easy.

890
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,100
Yeah.

891
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,560
Um, oh, so in this...

892
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,360
Okay, oh.

893
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,920
No, no, no, that works, right?

894
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,960
I actually were, like, when we tried sniping.

895
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:31,780
Oh, oh, so, uh, in this game, what people do is they run with their knife out.

896
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:32,680
You know that, right?

897
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,180
Yeah, yeah, you're fast, too.

898
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,860
I know that, yeah.

899
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,020
Yeah, but...

900
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,240
Does Valorant do that, too?

901
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,060
I think so.

902
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,080
I think it's, like, just a tactical shooter thing.

903
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:45,200
Also, sound guy boosted Doobie a bit up more.

904
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,800
So, let me know if she's more audible.

905
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,240
Okay.

906
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,040
All right, so what were you gonna say about the AWP?

907
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:55,840
Uh, no, I just wanted you to try using it.

908
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,100
Oh, okay, okay.

909
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,060
Yeah.

910
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,340
I'm learning.

911
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,900
Let's see, I'm trying to think what else can I show you.

912
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:05,000
Oh, uh, I'll let you backstab me.

913
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,380
Oh, wait, wait, wait, where's the smoke line?

914
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,280
I wanna try that again.

915
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,240
Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

916
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:10,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

917
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,320
Okay, this time.

918
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,700
There's another one you can try that's a little bit easier if you want.

919
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,200
Or, try that one.

920
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,720
Okay, I figured it out.

921
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,160
Oh, here in this corner?

922
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:18,420
Yeah.

923
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:19,460
I figured it out.

924
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,820
And then, slightly above the shadow, so, like, uh...

925
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:23,760
Um...

926
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,420
Is that...

927
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,540
Where did that go?

928
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:25,940
No.

929
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,460
Let's see, wait, wait, here, here, here.

930
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,280
Pick this up.

931
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,100
Yeah.

932
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,240
Where did it go?

933
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,440
I could show you another one.

934
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:33,820
Oh, yeah.

935
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:34,420
Try it.

936
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,040
This one's easier.

937
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,280
So...

938
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,140
Like, stand next to me.

939
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:37,780
Yeah.

940
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,680
Do you see this line that's right there?

941
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:39,960
Yeah.

942
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,940
Like, a line in the map?

943
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:41,500
Yeah.

944
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,800
Yeah, so, line up with that, like, your body.

945
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,160
And then, look at, uh...

946
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,200
There's a dot right there.

947
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:47,980
So, look at that.

948
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:48,460
And then...

949
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:48,900
Wait, where?

950
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,320
Um...

951
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,620
Oh, where I shot, like, right there?

952
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,720
Oh, right here.

953
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,140
Oh, okay.

954
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,220
There's so many holes.

955
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:59,600
I think just look at that and then jump and throw at the same time.

956
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,200
Okay.

957
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:00,960
All right.

958
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,320
Like that?

959
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:03,680
Nice.

960
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:04,880
Yeah.

961
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:05,340
Yeah.

962
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,260
Did that make it?

963
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,640
It's like, look...

964
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,600
Yeah, you kind of...

965
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:09,860
Yeah!

966
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,400
Yeah, I think it works.

967
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,020
Yeah!

968
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:12,360
Nice!

969
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:16,100
And I'll never do that in real game.

970
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,080
In real life.

971
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:23,040
This might not be good for, like, going cat, but...

972
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,320
It could still work.

973
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:25,240
Yeah, it could still work.

974
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:25,580
Yeah, yeah.

975
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,420
All right, kill me.

976
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:28,120
Okay.

977
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:31,100
Yeah!

978
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,820
I'll try to think what else is there I can show you.

979
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,200
Oh, uh, by a Zeus.

980
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,520
It's under the armor.

981
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:45,860
Oh, armor, okay.

982
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,580
Oh, is that the electrocuted one?

983
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,420
Uh-huh, yeah.

984
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:51,080
Yeah, yeah.

985
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:52,840
It looks like an electric...

986
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,420
Usually people always buy, um, like, the Kevlar and the helmet, too.

987
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:56,720
Yeah.

988
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,580
When they have enough money.

989
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,220
Oh my god, yeah, this is also why...

990
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:01,540
Usually...

991
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,620
It's also why I don't like tactical shooters, because I have to do math.

992
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:06,280
All right.

993
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:06,980
All right.

994
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:07,760
Yeah, kind of...

995
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,440
Well, kind of.

996
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:09,880
There...

997
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,840
Yeah, it's the economy.

998
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:11,440
You have to keep...

999
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:11,620
Yeah.

1000
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,820
All right, so what do I do with a Zeus?

1001
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,360
Oh, you have to be pretty close and see if you can get me.

1002
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:20,960
Oh.

1003
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:22,900
Oh, what the f...

1004
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:23,600
Oh, what?

1005
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,020
It was on you!

1006
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,940
You have to be super, super close.

1007
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,820
Oh, okay.

1008
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,520
I get it.

1009
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,900
Okay, I was like, okay.

1010
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,280
My crosshair was definitely on you there.

1011
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:41,080
All right, I'm gonna...

1012
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:44,500
I'm gonna plant the bomb, so you can experience, um, defusing it.

1013
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,240
Okay.

1014
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,040
Okay.

1015
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:48,700
All right, are you gonna...

1016
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:48,840
Oh.

1017
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,000
Are you gonna rush B?

1018
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:52,520
We should probably buy some other nades, like, just to get an idea.

1019
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:52,900
Yeah?

1020
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:53,820
No...

1021
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:53,960
No.

1022
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,980
Are you gonna rush B?

1023
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:58,460
Oh!

1024
00:35:58,620 --> 00:35:58,780
No.

1025
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,000
God fucking...

1026
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,240
Okay.

1027
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,280
Where are you?

1028
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,460
Oh, where?

1029
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:07,420
Oh.

1030
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:07,880
Hi!

1031
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,980
Wait, you get immunity from that?

1032
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,380
No, no, no, I don't.

1033
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:12,680
I don't.

1034
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,380
You just missed.

1035
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:13,800
Okay.

1036
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,880
Wait, how do I defuse?

1037
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:16,860
I don't remember how to defuse.

1038
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,600
Oh, press E.

1039
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,260
Oh, is it E?

1040
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:19,560
Okay.

1041
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,860
Oh my god, you whore.

1042
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:28,460
So, usually you're supposed to buy, um, a defuse kit.

1043
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,920
The defuse kit will make it so it's only five seconds.

1044
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:32,700
So, quick, quick, come defuse.

1045
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:33,480
I think you can...

1046
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:33,680
Okay.

1047
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:33,900
Okay.

1048
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,420
You should stop.

1049
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:36,860
No!

1050
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,100
Wait, did I make it?

1051
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:40,500
I think you got it!

1052
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,360
Did I make it?

1053
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:42,040
Oh, I made it.

1054
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:42,380
Nice.

1055
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:42,720
Okay.

1056
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,380
All right.

1057
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,000
Nice.

1058
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:53,400
All right.

1059
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,100
I'll try to think what else is there to show you.

1060
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:59,560
I guess, uh, we could try the...

1061
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,980
Buy an MP4, I think it's called.

1062
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:02,500
Okay.

1063
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:04,580
MP4.

1064
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,460
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1065
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:09,180
We'll test with the, uh, the, uh, submachine guns.

1066
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,540
Oh, wait.

1067
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:11,560
MP4?

1068
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,420
Where is that one?

1069
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:14,760
Wait, maybe it's not MP4.

1070
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:15,440
MP5?

1071
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:17,760
Yeah, I was gonna say, there's no four here.

1072
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:18,440
There is.

1073
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,080
I have a collection of guns right now.

1074
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,200
All right.

1075
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,120
Nice.

1076
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:25,640
Yay!

1077
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:26,520
Oh, yeah.

1078
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:29,860
You seem pretty used to pressing crouch, like, while shooting, right?

1079
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:30,300
Oh, yeah.

1080
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,560
That's because the...

1081
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,340
It's from watching too many CSGO streams back then.

1082
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,300
Oh, yeah.

1083
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,940
So, I know, like...

1084
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:39,220
I always see people crouch whenever they play CS.

1085
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,020
Hmm.

1086
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,220
Yeah, it does help, uh...

1087
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:43,780
Actually, I...

1088
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,040
I don't know what it does.

1089
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:45,460
No, I think that's still saying.

1090
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,560
Yeah, I was gonna say, I don't know what it does.

1091
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:49,960
It's supposed to help, uh, like, with recoil a bit.

1092
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,640
I'm pretty sure.

1093
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,080
I see.

1094
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,640
I don't know what it does.

1095
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,900
I just saw people do it.

1096
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:55,880
So, I was just like, okay.

1097
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:59,900
If they do it, then that means they know what they...

1098
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:00,820
That means it's good.

1099
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:01,780
Oh, uh, try...

1100
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,900
Try going around, uh, to A site.

1101
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:04,760
A site, okay.

1102
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,520
And then, yeah.

1103
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,880
I'll try pushing long so you can get, uh...

1104
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,980
A good idea of how it usually goes.

1105
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,220
Oh, I should've bought a spoke.

1106
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:11,600
Oh, well.

1107
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:12,480
Oh, all right.

1108
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,820
MP4 video, yeah.

1109
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,020
All right.

1110
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:25,860
So, usually they come out, like, long doors, and then they come into pit, and they're, like...

1111
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,340
Oh my god, you shot me.

1112
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,220
...hitting, sniping.

1113
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:30,600
Oh my god.

1114
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:33,580
And then, I forgot to smoke, but they'll always smoke, like, this area.

1115
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,320
So, like, say you're rotating from me.

1116
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:39,280
You can't really see, like, when they cross over, like this.

1117
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:39,600
Yeah.

1118
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,340
And then...

1119
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,080
And then, what?

1120
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,920
They tried to plant, like, here for long.

1121
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:47,320
Yeah.

1122
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:47,980
I didn't like it.

1123
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:51,160
Oh, and then this is goose here, because, like, look over here.

1124
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,000
Wait, why is it goose?

1125
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,500
Oh, there's a goose.

1126
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,300
Yeah, yeah.

1127
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,040
So, this is, like, the call out, like, oh, goose, goose.

1128
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:57,900
Yeah.

1129
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,520
Oh, they're like, they're a goose, they're a goose.

1130
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,720
This call out's really complicated over here.

1131
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:03,780
This one's called car.

1132
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,020
A car, yeah.

1133
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:07,500
Is there only one car on this map?

1134
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:09,560
Um, actually, no.

1135
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,800
There's a car on B, too.

1136
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,420
Oh, okay, it's like A car.

1137
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,660
That one is also car.

1138
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,540
I guess it'll be, like, A car.

1139
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:17,960
You can, uh, you can defuse.

1140
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:18,980
Oh, wait, try backstabbing me.

1141
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,260
It's an instant kill, usually, I think.

1142
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,420
Oh, nice.

1143
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,140
Well, guess I'll die.

1144
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,160
Goodbye.

1145
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:33,680
If you, if you, uh, knife someone with mouse one, it's gonna take, like, two or three hits before you kill them.

1146
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,620
Oh, so it's just, like, Valorant with the, the right click thing.

1147
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:37,160
Mm, yeah.

1148
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:37,520
Okay.

1149
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,520
All right, now I'm a terrorist.

1150
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:41,200
All right, so...

1151
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:44,620
Yeah, well, uh, you can go plant.

1152
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:45,840
I'll let you try planting.

1153
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,540
Oh, okay.

1154
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:49,760
Uh...

1155
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,020
I got this.

1156
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,280
I know what to do.

1157
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:55,640
I believe in you.

1158
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,060
I know what to do now.

1159
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,180
I know what you're gonna do.

1160
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,020
No, you don't.

1161
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:01,680
Yeah, huh.

1162
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,500
No, you don't.

1163
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,680
What am I gonna do?

1164
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,900
You're gonna rush B, aren't you?

1165
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,680
Haha, you think that.

1166
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:16,320
Or maybe, maybe I am, or maybe I am rushing B right now, just to mess with you.

1167
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:19,180
Maybe I am doing that.

1168
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,360
Or maybe I'm mid.

1169
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,680
Oh, I see.

1170
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,420
Oh, wait, I flashed myself.

1171
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:32,960
I thought...

1172
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,040
You know what you think?

1173
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,220
It goes higher than what it's supposed to.

1174
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,340
That's me right now.

1175
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,800
I thought it'd go higher.

1176
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,780
Oh, and, um, do you know, like, you can shift walk?

1177
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:49,420
Oh, yeah, yeah, the, uh, so you don't make noise.

1178
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:51,840
Oh!

1179
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:53,620
Yeah.

1180
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,080
Yeah.

1181
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:54,840
Yeah.

1182
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:58,780
I'm playing.

1183
00:40:59,160 --> 00:40:59,640
Oh.

1184
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,300
Okay, so, um...

1185
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:06,080
Oh, so when you're falling down, you, uh, the momentum stops when you're throwing a name.

1186
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:07,860
Is that it?

1187
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:08,460
Oh.

1188
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,120
I don't know.

1189
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,380
So when my chat said that...

1190
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:11,740
Actually, I'm not sure.

1191
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:12,460
Yeah.

1192
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:13,780
So I'm not sure either.

1193
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:17,140
Yeah, you do have to throw it, like, right when you're at that apex of your jump.

1194
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:17,480
Oh!

1195
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,700
I guess, the top of your jump.

1196
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,560
I see.

1197
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:20,120
Yeah.

1198
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:20,780
Okay.

1199
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,980
Let me, let me try, I'll try throwing a smoke just to un...

1200
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,300
Because I do it subconsciously, so I'm not really sure.

1201
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:25,900
Let me try.

1202
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,740
Who cares about economy?

1203
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:34,940
So you, you can press mouse one with your nade out and just hold it out and then you jump and release.

1204
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,480
Oh, okay.

1205
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:44,700
Yeah, and then if you hold mouse one long enough, uh, it comes up with, like, a grenade crosshair.

1206
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:46,500
It takes up the whole screen.

1207
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:47,180
Uh-huh.

1208
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,380
Oh, okay.

1209
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:51,720
So it's both, you just, like, preempted, oh my god, fuck.

1210
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,580
God, I hate you, Till.

1211
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:58,160
I hate you, Till, so much.

1212
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:01,540
I'm just using my ability that I bought that is in a can.

1213
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:02,920
It's an ability in a can.

1214
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:06,240
Okay, nice.

1215
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:06,500
Oh, nice!

1216
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,320
Yeah, I think you got it.

1217
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:13,300
Really?

1218
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,440
Really?

1219
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,240
I'm a real CS player now.

1220
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:16,860
Let's go!

1221
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:25,080
Uh, so I wonder if we should try playing a game after this?

1222
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:25,620
Oh, yeah.

1223
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:26,340
Yeah.

1224
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:28,560
And then I'll never use my util.

1225
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,440
I think it takes a while to get used to using it.

1226
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:36,780
Yeah, because it's, like, it's just, like, so much information when it comes to util.

1227
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:40,800
And then making, like, smoke placements and shit like that.

1228
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:42,200
I'm just, I just want to shoot things.

1229
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:42,460
What do you mean?

1230
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,520
Wait, what do you mean so much information?

1231
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,060
Marvel has how many characters?

1232
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:47,040
That's so much!

1233
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,260
How many villains do you know?

1234
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:52,940
I just put my, I just put my crosshair on someone and then they're dead.

1235
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:55,720
It's different.

1236
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:57,040
It's so different.

1237
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,960
That's, that's exactly what this meme is.

1238
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,140
That's what it comes down to.

1239
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:02,220
There's no smoke.

1240
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:05,020
There's no smoke in Marvel Rivals.

1241
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:05,720
Really?

1242
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:06,580
It's my one weakness.

1243
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:07,980
I'm pretty sure Punisher has a smoke.

1244
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,380
Yeah, it lasts, like, two seconds.

1245
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:12,140
Yeah, it does, it does.

1246
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:16,340
No, the smokes do last a crazy long time.

1247
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:16,840
Yeah, they last looking forever.

1248
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:22,340
Are you Goose again?

1249
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:22,940
No.

1250
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:27,380
Wouldn't you wanna know?

1251
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,480
Oh, nice.

1252
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,260
That's right.

1253
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,600
Trying to get you with my scalp.

1254
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:35,940
You said I was Goose and I walked away from Goose.

1255
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:36,540
All right.

1256
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:45,300
Oh, you should try using, do you have the Deagle equipped?

1257
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,000
The Desert Eagle?

1258
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:46,820
Oh yeah, I do.

1259
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,100
Oh, 1v1 Desert Eagle?

1260
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:50,920
What have you been working for?

1261
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:52,120
Yeah.

1262
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:52,840
Yeah.

1263
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,020
Yeah, my brain...

1264
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:57,680
I feel like, uh, you'll probably do better than me.

1265
00:43:58,340 --> 00:43:58,780
What?

1266
00:43:58,780 --> 00:43:59,140
No!

1267
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:00,560
I suck with the Deagle.

1268
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:03,420
Oh no, I suck at Pistol too, so don't worry.

1269
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:08,300
Oh, I know where you are.

1270
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:10,680
Wait, do I though?

1271
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,480
Actually, I don't know.

1272
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:17,570
I'm so bad at using numbers.

1273
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:21,650
You know when you're swapping equipment?

1274
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:23,250
I just use scroll wheel.

1275
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:23,830
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1276
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:25,670
I mostly just use scroll wheel.

1277
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:28,370
Yeah, me too.

1278
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:32,990
I mostly use scroll wheel and then I have like a switch to primary weapon on like mouse 4.

1279
00:44:33,350 --> 00:44:34,050
Oh, that's smart.

1280
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:39,390
Yeah, I do that for Apex, but for Marvel, I just use my scroll wheel because it's just two weapons.

1281
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:42,290
Where are you?

1282
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:46,090
I don't know, I think I'll let you win this one.

1283
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:52,490
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait wait, wait, wait.

1284
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:57,590
Were you in the middle of throwing that?

1285
00:44:57,970 --> 00:45:00,490
You popped up and I had my grenade.

1286
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:06,390
Okay, I don't know.

1287
00:45:06,430 --> 00:45:07,570
Did you actually waited?

1288
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:11,810
Did I wait?

1289
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:13,770
Did you wait when I said wait?

1290
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:16,610
Oh, no, no, no.

1291
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:18,350
I was all the way at long doors.

1292
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:20,610
Okay.

1293
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:25,890
I don't know how... Yeah, I don't know how I survived that.

1294
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:26,830
All right.

1295
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:27,430
Oh, shit!

1296
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:29,730
Oh, man!

1297
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:30,010
Damn it!

1298
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:33,950
I knew you'd be too much Desert Eagle.

1299
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:37,830
Yeah, you baited me.

1300
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:39,350
I was like, holy fuck.

1301
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:44,110
I don't know how I survived.

1302
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:46,930
Now you'll think I'm gonna go B again.

1303
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:48,650
But joke's on you.

1304
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:51,010
That's definitely where I'm going next.

1305
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:53,770
All right, I'll see you there.

1306
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:00,260
Oh, my mouse 4 is voice chat.

1307
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:00,640
That's weird.

1308
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,380
Oh, where am I?

1309
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:05,940
Doobie.

1310
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:07,260
Where am I?

1311
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:09,680
Not at B.

1312
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:11,300
Where could I be?

1313
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:12,860
Ho, ho, ho.

1314
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:18,640
Dang it.

1315
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:23,400
Where could I be, Doobie?

1316
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:29,600
Ha, ha, ha.

1317
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,140
Oh, my God!

1318
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:38,060
Oh, my God!

1319
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:38,180
Oh, my God!

1320
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:38,700
How did you know?

1321
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,200
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

1322
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:42,780
Sorry.

1323
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:43,580
Sorry.

1324
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:46,680
I don't think you can jump up there.

1325
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:53,140
No, I thought you were gonna go to the main door and I was gonna do, like, a sick air shot.

1326
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:55,060
But it didn't work out.

1327
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:56,320
It didn't work.

1328
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,360
It wasn't as sick as I thought.

1329
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:02,540
All right.

1330
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:06,880
Wait, does this make it?

1331
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,360
Let me try.

1332
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:10,560
Ow.

1333
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:10,960
Wait.

1334
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:11,520
Oh, fuck.

1335
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:12,480
I forgot about fall damage.

1336
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:17,440
Oh, you should use flashes, too.

1337
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:22,580
Like, whenever you're doing your first entry onto whatever point you're going on.

1338
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:23,800
All right.

1339
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:24,100
Okay.

1340
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:26,700
I did.

1341
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:28,040
Oh, did you smoke mid?

1342
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:29,040
Oh.

1343
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:29,920
Maybe.

1344
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:32,160
I thought I heard a smoke.

1345
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:33,280
Oh.

1346
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:39,970
Which way would you go?

1347
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:44,160
Oh.

1348
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:44,720
Oh.

1349
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:44,980
Oh.

1350
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:50,770
You gotta be sneaky.

1351
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:51,770
You gotta be sneaky.

1352
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:57,650
I be sneaky when I can just shoot the head.

1353
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:02,770
That's because you're, like, giving away information.

1354
00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:05,630
So, when you were jumping, I knew that you were in that corner.

1355
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:06,110
Yeah.

1356
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:08,150
Oh, that's smart.

1357
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:08,310
All right.

1358
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:10,230
I know what to do.

1359
00:48:10,410 --> 00:48:11,310
I learned this.

1360
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:15,940
Oh, my God.

1361
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:16,380
Oh, my God.

1362
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,020
I think that hits.

1363
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:18,740
Oh, my God.

1364
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:19,360
I did it.

1365
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,340
I did it.

1366
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:23,940
What'd you do?

1367
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,940
When you want to know.

1368
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:28,740
But then I went the wrong way.

1369
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,840
I went the wrong way.

1370
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:38,740
I...

1371
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:41,220
What did you hit?

1372
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:43,920
When you want to know.

1373
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,380
What the fuck?

1374
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:47,420
When did you go over here?

1375
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,320
How did you get there?

1376
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:53,840
I was, like, by a CT spawn.

1377
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,640
When you go mid-door, like, pots to cat.

1378
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:58,040
Oh, my God.

1379
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:00,520
I didn't know you could do that.

1380
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:04,640
I was so confused.

1381
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,580
How did you get there so fast?

1382
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:08,720
So, what did you do?

1383
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:09,960
Did you throw, like, a smoke?

1384
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,560
Yeah, I threw smoke through mid.

1385
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:13,020
And I was, like, I did it.

1386
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:13,720
Oh.

1387
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:15,560
Yeah, I didn't see it.

1388
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:18,220
Whoa.

1389
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:22,420
I don't think you're smoke mid at all.

1390
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:23,400
No, no.

1391
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:24,580
I didn't under smoke in mid.

1392
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:25,280
Did you see it?

1393
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:29,930
It tricked me!

1394
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:30,910
Yes!

1395
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:34,450
That's messed up.

1396
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:36,450
It worked.

1397
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:38,690
It made me to look.

1398
00:49:38,890 --> 00:49:39,610
All right, all right.

1399
00:49:42,570 --> 00:49:44,770
Okay, you should see my POV.

1400
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:48,370
The moment I said Ted, I just, you just peaked out.

1401
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:52,870
My crosshair was right on you, too.

1402
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:56,150
Yeah, it's the psychological warfare.

1403
00:49:56,790 --> 00:50:00,070
I made you look.

1404
00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:02,670
All right.

1405
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,210
Now it's time for a real game.

1406
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:07,030
It's time.

1407
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:13,750
I don't think it's gonna work with the other real players.

1408
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:15,710
Like, other people were like, did you see it?

1409
00:50:15,770 --> 00:50:17,450
So, we're gonna be...

1410
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:18,610
Oh, true.

1411
00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:20,750
I'm gonna fix one of my settings.

1412
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:21,310
Okay.

1413
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:22,690
No problem.

1414
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:27,560
Oh, man.

1415
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:30,160
I'm gonna get absolutely shit on now.

1416
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:33,520
No, you have good aim.

1417
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:36,160
That's all this game comes down to.

1418
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:37,660
Well, aim and movement, I guess.

1419
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:39,420
Yeah, I don't know where cover is.

1420
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:42,060
I was literally standing in the open.

1421
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:44,540
Just crouch behind your teammate.

1422
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:45,660
Oh, okay.

1423
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:46,820
Can't follow you around.

1424
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:49,000
Wait, me?

1425
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:50,880
Do it to one of the other teammates.

1426
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,260
But we're a duo.

1427
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:55,460
D and D.

1428
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:00,760
Can't have the D without...

1429
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:01,580
Oh, yeah.

1430
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,600
We can't have the D without the other D.

1431
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:06,880
We're missing a D.

1432
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:09,100
The double Ds.

1433
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:10,420
Yeah, the double Ds.

1434
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:11,960
That's how we like them.

1435
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:15,380
Wait, actually.

1436
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,040
Yeah, that's how we like them.

1437
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:17,880
The double Ds.

1438
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:21,020
Okay.

1439
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:22,760
I guess it's pissed around.

1440
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:25,280
Teammates?

1441
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:27,540
Well, I'm sure you're used to talking with people online.

1442
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:28,600
Like, in games and stuff.

1443
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:29,560
Oh, yeah.

1444
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:30,240
I was gonna say.

1445
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:33,000
CS is a different one.

1446
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:35,720
That's where the people get extra gamey.

1447
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:37,080
Alright, let me...

1448
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:37,760
How the fuck?

1449
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:38,260
Yeah.

1450
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:41,040
Where the fuck is the other player voice?

1451
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:41,840
Okay, zero.

1452
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:42,940
Yeah, I don't...

1453
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:44,160
I don't want to risk it.

1454
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,040
Unless they're Russian.

1455
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:46,820
Okay.

1456
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,040
And it's a little silly.

1457
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:50,120
Yeah, they'll...

1458
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:51,200
Oh, okay.

1459
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:51,640
So...

1460
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:52,860
I'm gonna pick up the bomb.

1461
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:53,860
Because this guy dropped it.

1462
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:55,840
Alright.

1463
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:56,700
Oh, hey.

1464
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:57,040
Alright.

1465
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,080
So, we got some picks on B.

1466
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:00,420
So, we'll probably just go B, I think.

1467
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:02,080
Okay.

1468
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:06,540
Oh, our guy got another pick.

1469
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:07,260
Let's go.

1470
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:08,480
I'm right behind you.

1471
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:10,980
Nice.

1472
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:11,880
Oh, another one close.

1473
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:12,260
Ah.

1474
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:13,540
Where is he?

1475
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:14,860
Where is he?

1476
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:16,960
Oh, he's there.

1477
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:17,760
Oh, nice.

1478
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:18,220
Yeah.

1479
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:19,880
Here, teammate.

1480
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:20,700
He's like, car.

1481
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,020
No, I turned it down.

1482
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:25,080
I got scared.

1483
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:26,340
Okay, I'll turn it.

1484
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:27,520
I did it.

1485
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:27,760
Oh, okay.

1486
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,820
I keep mine, like, at 30%.

1487
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:31,200
Oh, 30?

1488
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:31,580
Yeah.

1489
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:32,720
So, I can still kind of here.

1490
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:33,080
Yeah.

1491
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:34,480
Alright, I'll put it at 30%.

1492
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:35,960
I was like, where is he?

1493
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:37,560
Alright.

1494
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:40,940
Oh, so, in the first round, usually people buy, like, the Kevlar vest.

1495
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:43,580
And then, second round, we buy the Kevlar and helmet.

1496
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:44,120
Okay.

1497
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:49,540
And then, you could buy an AK, but a lot of times, people will just buy, like, Mac-10 and Rush.

1498
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:52,060
With the armor and stuff.

1499
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:54,300
Oh.

1500
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:56,000
Are we blue or yellow?

1501
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:56,380
Oh, no.

1502
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:57,640
We're yellow.

1503
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:00,880
We're yellow.

1504
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:01,020
We're yellow?

1505
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:02,980
Oh, like the kill feed.

1506
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:03,440
Yeah.

1507
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:04,720
Yeah, we are yellow.

1508
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:05,580
Oh, yeah.

1509
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:06,440
Yeah.

1510
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:08,820
Teesside is always, uh, yellow.

1511
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:09,460
Is always yellow?

1512
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:10,220
Oh.

1513
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:12,160
Ooh, we're terrorists.

1514
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:17,340
Don't worry, I am...

1515
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:18,540
Oh, wait.

1516
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:21,540
Don't worry, I'm looking at car.

1517
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:24,800
Okay, nice.

1518
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:26,760
Oh, one's coming window.

1519
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,060
So, this is window up there.

1520
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:28,440
Uh-huh.

1521
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:28,900
Oh, nice.

1522
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:29,940
Oh, one's tunnels.

1523
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:31,400
So, where I died, there's tunnels.

1524
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:32,520
Okay.

1525
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:36,260
There's no way he didn't know I'm here.

1526
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:37,200
Yay!

1527
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:38,100
No.

1528
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:40,920
No, we're doing it!

1529
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,520
Oh, my God, this game is easy.

1530
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:44,620
Yeah, see?

1531
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:45,620
Yeah, it is.

1532
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:46,100
It is.

1533
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:46,900
We just...

1534
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:48,520
It's just aimed at the head.

1535
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:49,760
That's all you gotta do.

1536
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:54,260
I feel like the way you play, though, you probably like to go pretty fast, right?

1537
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:55,740
Like, Apex has good movement.

1538
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:59,020
Yeah, like, I think that was my issue with...

1539
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:00,940
This is faster than Valorant, though.

1540
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:01,800
Which is nice.

1541
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:02,920
My issue with...

1542
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:03,120
Really?

1543
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:04,500
My issue...

1544
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,200
Well, I guess because we're on quick play right now.

1545
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:10,980
But, like, when I play Valorant quick play, people are just, like, lurking and shit all the time.

1546
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:12,080
Or, like...

1547
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:12,520
Oh.

1548
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,160
They play so fucking slow.

1549
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:16,240
But right now, everyone's playing super fast.

1550
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:18,840
I just assume it's more so, like...

1551
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:18,980
Yeah.

1552
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:19,520
Oh, my God.

1553
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,900
Oh, we're both bad at screen.

1554
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:22,940
Oh, we're both bad at screen.

1555
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,920
The guy that did...

1556
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:27,040
He wasn't looking at my screen.

1557
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:28,500
And then we both whiffed.

1558
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:29,860
Oh.

1559
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:32,060
Reading chat, huh?

1560
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:32,460
Yeah.

1561
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:34,980
Tsk, tsk.

1562
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,560
But it's more so, like...

1563
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:38,560
You know how, like...

1564
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,720
In Valorant, everybody plays so fucking slow.

1565
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:42,780
And then they rotate a lot and stuff like that.

1566
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:43,660
Oh, yeah.

1567
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:44,100
Yeah.

1568
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:44,840
Yeah.

1569
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,380
This is, like, a lot fast-paced.

1570
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:48,840
But I also assume it's fast-paced because it's quick play.

1571
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:50,220
Oh.

1572
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,320
Oh, we're playing comp right now.

1573
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:53,340
Wait, this is comp?

1574
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:55,180
Yeah.

1575
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,900
Well, there's comp, which is kind of like quick play.

1576
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:58,300
Yeah.

1577
00:54:58,500 --> 00:54:59,560
Then there's also premiere.

1578
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:02,380
Which is, like, the actual ranks.

1579
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:02,880
Yeah.

1580
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:03,140
Yeah.

1581
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:06,400
So you still get a rank on this, on comp, once you win.

1582
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,000
Single maps, though.

1583
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:11,420
So you could get a rank on Dust today if you wanted.

1584
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:12,780
But I don't know if we'll go that far.

1585
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,160
Wait, so, like...

1586
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:17,780
It's rank per map and not rank overall?

1587
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:21,380
Yeah, there is overall rank, but it's premiere.

1588
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:23,160
But in competitive, there's rank per map.

1589
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:26,780
And it's kind of is like quick play because there's only casual.

1590
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:29,580
Which is, like, you have ten people on each side.

1591
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:30,680
Which is different.

1592
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:32,860
This is, like, a 5v5 normal competitive.

1593
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:34,460
Oh, I see.

1594
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:35,580
I smoked mid.

1595
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:37,660
I don't know that'll help anybody.

1596
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:38,520
No.

1597
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:41,160
It was a good smoke.

1598
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:43,120
It was a really good smoke.

1599
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:43,900
This guy right around the corner.

1600
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:45,220
Okay, I got one.

1601
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:48,740
I think there might be another one to your left, but I'm not sure.

1602
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:50,120
No!

1603
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,260
He headshot me!

1604
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:52,600
I don't even know.

1605
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:54,180
You hit him a little bit, though.

1606
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,480
How do I see how much damage I did on him?

1607
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,520
Oh, you have to wait until the round is over.

1608
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:00,880
And then it will show up, like, above.

1609
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:02,500
So you can't be, like...

1610
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:03,740
Yeah, it'll show up under their names.

1611
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:05,620
Oh, I see.

1612
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:09,440
There used to be a way that you could open up, like, the console command.

1613
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:09,860
Uh-huh.

1614
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,680
And see how much damage you did.

1615
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:12,580
Yeah, because, like...

1616
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:13,580
Yeah, they patched it out.

1617
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:17,180
In Valorant, you'd be like, oh, like, 30 breach or some shit.

1618
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:19,080
Like, or stuff like that.

1619
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:19,820
So...

1620
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:20,580
I thought it's CS and you see.

1621
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:24,540
You just have to assume that you hopefully did damage until the round is over.

1622
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:25,420
Yeah, oh...

1623
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:27,300
I was gonna say.

1624
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:31,100
Because, I mean, realistically, you wouldn't know if you shot them.

1625
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:31,700
Yeah.

1626
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:32,420
Like, if they're still moving.

1627
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:35,900
Like, at the best, you could just hear the, like, gun sound.

1628
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:38,020
Doki, Braid.

1629
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:39,560
Oh, my God.

1630
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:42,520
What a bug, Green.

1631
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:42,800
Spray your prey.

1632
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:44,780
Oh, no!

1633
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:48,120
What?

1634
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,940
I think he got, uh...

1635
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:52,140
Headshot with the grenade.

1636
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:55,800
Wait, how do you look at chat?

1637
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:57,040
How do you type in chat?

1638
00:56:58,360 --> 00:56:59,740
Oh, um, T...

1639
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:02,280
Oh, no, Y is for all chat, and then U is for team chat.

1640
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:03,900
Oh, you don't have...

1641
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:04,520
Wait, what?

1642
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:05,340
It shows...

1643
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:05,840
Oh, there you go.

1644
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,380
Wait, I'm just talking to team.

1645
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:09,820
Oh, I don't have a bug.

1646
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:13,280
Where's my old chat?

1647
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:14,580
Oh, there you go.

1648
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:16,900
What about to be...

1649
00:57:27,270 --> 00:57:27,830
Alright,

1650
00:57:31,310 --> 00:57:31,830
I'm mid.

1651
00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:33,690
I'm doing it.

1652
00:57:33,790 --> 00:57:34,810
I know call-ups.

1653
00:57:36,030 --> 00:57:36,570
I'm gonna...

1654
00:57:36,570 --> 00:57:36,650
There you go.

1655
00:57:36,650 --> 00:57:39,330
I'm slowly walking in mid.

1656
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:40,090
Oh!

1657
00:57:40,670 --> 00:57:41,310
Too slow.

1658
00:57:41,530 --> 00:57:41,950
Too slow.

1659
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:47,490
He said she eyed.

1660
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:51,250
Okay, I'll take it.

1661
00:57:52,270 --> 00:57:52,910
Yay!

1662
00:57:52,910 --> 00:57:52,990
Yay!

1663
00:57:54,590 --> 00:57:56,410
I died, but yay!

1664
00:57:57,490 --> 00:57:58,070
Yay!

1665
00:57:59,690 --> 00:58:00,330
Yay!

1666
00:58:00,330 --> 00:58:00,490
All right.

1667
00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:01,850
Oh, I can't afford...

1668
00:58:02,670 --> 00:58:04,230
God, I can't spread it so...

1669
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:05,610
We're gonna work on your...

1670
00:58:06,590 --> 00:58:07,490
Smoke mid.

1671
00:58:07,850 --> 00:58:08,390
All right.

1672
00:58:08,390 --> 00:58:09,010
Your mid-smoke.

1673
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:09,730
Watch this.

1674
00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:11,410
Don't worry.

1675
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:12,290
Watch this.

1676
00:58:13,130 --> 00:58:14,090
This time.

1677
00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:15,670
Watch this.

1678
00:58:17,070 --> 00:58:18,050
Are you gonna line it up?

1679
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:18,710
There you go.

1680
00:58:19,410 --> 00:58:20,190
That's definitely...

1681
00:58:20,190 --> 00:58:21,890
I definitely smoked mid this time.

1682
00:58:22,170 --> 00:58:23,150
How are you doing that?

1683
00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:23,830
Are you...

1684
00:58:25,470 --> 00:58:29,350
I swear to God, it's definitely hit the ground, for sure.

1685
00:58:32,430 --> 00:58:32,870
I...

1686
00:58:32,870 --> 00:58:33,690
I don't know.

1687
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:36,210
I swear to God, it hit the ground.

1688
00:58:38,130 --> 00:58:39,870
Oh, they're probably gonna push there, I think.

1689
00:58:41,890 --> 00:58:42,450
All right.

1690
00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:47,150
Oh my God, I'm scared.

1691
00:58:47,150 --> 00:58:48,750
Yeah, there's one over there.

1692
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:50,510
You can handle them.

1693
00:58:50,950 --> 00:58:51,070
No.

1694
00:58:52,350 --> 00:58:56,150
Yeah, I think the last two people are on A, so we'll...

1695
00:58:56,150 --> 00:58:57,290
Or on B, so we'll just go A.

1696
00:58:57,390 --> 00:58:58,070
Yeah, I left.

1697
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:06,600
I don't want to stand in front of them, I'm scared.

1698
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:07,520
I'll get shot.

1699
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:11,160
You can kill each other in this game.

1700
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:13,960
Yeah, I feel like I'm gonna get friendly fired.

1701
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,180
Let me make sure there's no lurkers.

1702
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:17,660
Okay.

1703
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:20,720
They're both here.

1704
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:21,380
Oh, they're both here?

1705
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:21,840
Yeah.

1706
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:23,180
Don't worry, I'm coming over.

1707
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:24,400
Get him, rush at them.

1708
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:25,600
The P90, you can rush.

1709
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:26,360
You can run at them.

1710
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:27,620
I did it.

1711
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:28,100
Oh, they got him.

1712
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:32,520
I was...

1713
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:36,360
My teammate took a bullet.

1714
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:37,380
Thank you, teammate.

1715
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:40,560
Oh my God, you're using the stand behind teammate.

1716
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:41,200
Okay, this time.

1717
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:42,020
This time, get the smoke.

1718
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:42,540
Watch this.

1719
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:45,760
Don't worry, guys.

1720
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:46,440
You gotta hold...

1721
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:48,000
Hold the mouse one with the smoke out.

1722
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:49,040
Like, you're ready to throw it.

1723
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:49,740
And then jump.

1724
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:50,280
Okay.

1725
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:51,980
Like, you're...

1726
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:53,260
Press mouse one and then jump.

1727
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:55,200
I did it.

1728
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:57,020
No.

1729
00:59:58,460 --> 00:59:59,520
It's the same place!

1730
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:00,300
No, no, no, I'm just saying.

1731
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:01,220
Yeah, what...

1732
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:02,940
Should I go on to the street?

1733
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:03,660
What is she doing?

1734
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,560
It's the same place, too.

1735
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:10,080
I can't believe it.

1736
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:11,660
I wonder...

1737
01:00:11,660 --> 01:00:13,620
Because there's a way to, like, do a half throw.

1738
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:15,240
So I wonder if you're doing the half throw.

1739
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:16,100
I could be.

1740
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:18,900
Honestly, I don't know what I'm doing.

1741
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:20,720
Oh, wait!

1742
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:21,180
There's...

1743
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:22,380
Oh, there's someone on the right.

1744
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:25,320
Oh my God, pussy?

1745
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,920
1v1 be like a real pro.

1746
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:32,040
I think they came out of long doors, maybe.

1747
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:33,820
Then we should put somebody there.

1748
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:34,220
Yeah.

1749
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:37,580
I can't believe it.

1750
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:37,840
Oh, wait.

1751
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:38,980
Chat says it's because...

1752
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:40,980
You moved your mouse while throwing.

1753
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:42,940
You have to keep your mouse, like, in the same spot.

1754
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:43,360
Oh!

1755
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:45,860
So there's, like, momentum shit?

1756
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:46,720
Or, wait.

1757
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:47,420
Actually, I don't know.

1758
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:49,540
Is chat lying?

1759
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:51,240
I'm not trying to explain it.

1760
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:52,940
Hmm.

1761
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:54,440
How do you...

1762
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:55,980
Do you wiggle your mouse when you throw it?

1763
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:56,880
I have no idea.

1764
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:57,740
I...

1765
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:00,340
I...

1766
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:01,420
I...

1767
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:02,380
I don't...

1768
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:03,260
I don't...

1769
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:05,800
Think about what I'm actually doing in the moment.

1770
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:07,500
Okay.

1771
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:10,880
No, you're...

1772
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:11,200
Yeah, yeah.

1773
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:13,120
I think you can get in the next try.

1774
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:17,700
I think the very first time I threw up a smoke during this round, I succeeded.

1775
01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:19,580
So I just need to do that again.

1776
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,020
However it's done.

1777
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:21,260
Okay.

1778
01:01:22,660 --> 01:01:23,040
Mm-hmm.

1779
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:24,040
Alright.

1780
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:25,880
It's all instinct, exactly, guys.

1781
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:30,780
My instincts might be wrong, but, like, it's all instinct.

1782
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:33,120
It's okay.

1783
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:33,620
We...

1784
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:34,960
You smell is carrying us.

1785
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:35,460
Thank God.

1786
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:37,420
Alright.

1787
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:38,260
Thank you for the...

1788
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:40,740
Thank you for the carry.

1789
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:42,740
I feel like you...

1790
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:45,040
You could probably be really good at this game if you learned it.

1791
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:45,540
Yeah.

1792
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:46,840
I...

1793
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:49,420
Like, every time I try to learn Valorant, I just give up.

1794
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:52,520
But, like...

1795
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:54,840
That was more frustrating for me.

1796
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:56,120
Because the rounds are...

1797
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:56,700
Yeah, like...

1798
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:57,180
Yeah, alright.

1799
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:58,060
I got this.

1800
01:01:58,160 --> 01:01:58,520
Watch this.

1801
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:05,300
Wait, wait, wait.

1802
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:07,400
Watch this.

1803
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:08,060
I didn't...

1804
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:08,620
I didn't...

1805
01:02:08,620 --> 01:02:10,320
I swear to God, I didn't move.

1806
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:10,860
Look, look, look.

1807
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:11,960
I'm sorry, guys.

1808
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:13,000
Okay, I'm looking.

1809
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:15,040
Like, do you see how I have the grenade?

1810
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:16,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1811
01:02:16,540 --> 01:02:17,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1812
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:17,500
I'm looking.

1813
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:18,380
Okay.

1814
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:19,080
So I have it.

1815
01:02:19,180 --> 01:02:20,060
I'm ready to throw it.

1816
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:20,400
Yeah.

1817
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:21,700
And then I jump and I release.

1818
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:23,200
Oh, so you jump and release.

1819
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:24,540
And I guess I keep it lined up.

1820
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:26,460
Yeah.

1821
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:27,600
Okay, I get it.

1822
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:28,520
But you press mouse one.

1823
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:30,720
And then jump and then release.

1824
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:34,420
Wait, guys, I swear to God, I'm not wiggling the mouse.

1825
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:36,340
I swear to God.

1826
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:38,660
My mouse is very still.

1827
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:42,440
There's no way anybody's on B.

1828
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:46,680
Y'all at A, right?

1829
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:47,220
Probably not.

1830
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:48,900
Oh my God, they're all dead.

1831
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:49,420
They're all dead right now.

1832
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:49,960
One's mid.

1833
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:50,920
They're all dead.

1834
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:52,520
Wait, are you going to go B?

1835
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:53,580
Because I'm going to go A.

1836
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:54,660
I'm at mid.

1837
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:57,980
Okay, he's CT.

1838
01:02:58,140 --> 01:02:59,080
He's like underneath me.

1839
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:00,540
That sounds weird.

1840
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:02,660
Oh, don't worry.

1841
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:03,500
I'm right behind him.

1842
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:06,960
Okay, maybe worry a little bit.

1843
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:07,100
Oh, no.

1844
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:07,800
There's a guy right out there.

1845
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:08,140
Oh, no.

1846
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:10,320
Wait, where is he?

1847
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:12,460
I don't know comms.

1848
01:03:12,460 --> 01:03:13,580
He's up there to the left.

1849
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:15,040
I don't know the comms.

1850
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:16,240
Yeah, past there.

1851
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:16,720
Yeah?

1852
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:20,100
Oh, he's going to shoot.

1853
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:20,240
To the right.

1854
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,120
He could be up there.

1855
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:25,340
Oh!

1856
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:27,560
He lurked back there.

1857
01:03:29,620 --> 01:03:32,020
I should have taught you that call out.

1858
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:32,820
That one's ramp.

1859
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:33,860
It's, yeah.

1860
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:35,600
It's like just a slanted hill thingy.

1861
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:36,020
I see.

1862
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,360
Okay, I got this.

1863
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:40,020
Now I know how to smoke.

1864
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:42,500
Oh, yeah.

1865
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:44,080
I looked left when you said to the right.

1866
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:46,460
Oh.

1867
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:48,120
That's awesome.

1868
01:03:48,340 --> 01:03:48,820
Okay, this time.

1869
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:48,940
No, no.

1870
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,040
I think you looked to the...

1871
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:50,860
I think you got it.

1872
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:51,760
This time.

1873
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:52,720
Okay.

1874
01:03:55,020 --> 01:03:55,460
Okay.

1875
01:04:00,620 --> 01:04:01,500
Is that...

1876
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:04,680
I don't have to say sad.

1877
01:04:05,140 --> 01:04:07,380
I don't know.

1878
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:07,820
I don't know.

1879
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:09,580
I don't know any...

1880
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:10,420
Status report.

1881
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:11,060
All right.

1882
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:13,480
I'm not wasting money on smokes.

1883
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:14,880
That's the status report.

1884
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:16,980
Oh, shit.

1885
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:18,360
Oh, my God.

1886
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:19,360
I'm not...

1887
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:20,120
Oh, my God.

1888
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:21,060
Who shot me?

1889
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:22,360
I can't.

1890
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:23,540
There were two of them.

1891
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:25,000
Oh, there were two of them.

1892
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:29,460
Oh, I'm supposed to not hold left button?

1893
01:04:31,020 --> 01:04:31,540
No.

1894
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:35,400
You hold it, and then you jump, and then release while you...

1895
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:37,200
Like, as you jump.

1896
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:37,720
Okay.

1897
01:04:38,060 --> 01:04:38,340
Okay.

1898
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:40,620
Okay, I'm gonna do it one more time, and then I'll tell you.

1899
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:42,640
Okay, you do it first, and then...

1900
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:45,420
Okay, okay.

1901
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:47,560
Don't worry, guys.

1902
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:49,080
I'm covering fire.

1903
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:50,420
I'm covering fire on the roof.

1904
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:51,780
There's no snipers on the roof.

1905
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:56,000
Okay, so...

1906
01:04:57,220 --> 01:04:59,780
I guess I jump and release at pretty much the same time.

1907
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:00,120
Okay.

1908
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:03,240
There you go.

1909
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:03,840
Oh, nice!

1910
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:04,820
Oh, I did it!

1911
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:05,480
I did it!

1912
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:06,480
Wait, wait, I think I hit it!

1913
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:07,140
I think I hit it!

1914
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:07,920
It's not on the roof!

1915
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:09,440
It's not on the roof!

1916
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:10,340
Oh, that's a bite gun.

1917
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:13,000
It's not on the roof.

1918
01:05:13,180 --> 01:05:13,800
That's an old...

1919
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:14,340
Oh, there's a guy pushing.

1920
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:14,840
There's a guy pushing.

1921
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:15,340
There's a guy pushing.

1922
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:16,500
You didn't see me, right?

1923
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:19,000
No.

1924
01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:20,180
But he might be watching the screen.

1925
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:21,580
Oh, my God!

1926
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:22,120
You see me!

1927
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:25,340
Okay, I hit him.

1928
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:26,960
I saw the blood splatter.

1929
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:29,940
There was a blood splatter.

1930
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:34,880
Yeah, so now you can see at the top, like, where you hit them.

1931
01:05:35,060 --> 01:05:36,220
Wait, where do you see that?

1932
01:05:36,380 --> 01:05:37,000
Like, does it say the damage at the top?

1933
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:38,520
Uh, 61 in two.

1934
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:39,520
It's like underneath their pictures.

1935
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:39,940
Oh.

1936
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:41,540
Okay, he shot me.

1937
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:43,260
He shot five bullets, guys.

1938
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:44,440
I shot two.

1939
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:48,260
Well, you shot more than that.

1940
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:49,760
No, no, no, I shot two.

1941
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:53,320
Okay, I'll buy a flashbang.

1942
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:55,040
Okay.

1943
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:59,080
I guess we're gonna push, yeah, rush D.

1944
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:01,020
Alright, I have a D go.

1945
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:04,400
And a flashbang.

1946
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:05,080
They're gonna push here.

1947
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:08,040
Close, probably lower tens if you wanna watch it.

1948
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:09,560
Alright, I'll watch lower tens.

1949
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:15,310
Shoot from above.

1950
01:06:19,090 --> 01:06:20,410
Oh, they might have heard that.

1951
01:06:20,950 --> 01:06:21,710
Oh, shit!

1952
01:06:21,710 --> 01:06:22,850
Oh, nice.

1953
01:06:22,850 --> 01:06:24,010
Whoa, nice.

1954
01:06:25,230 --> 01:06:26,370
The one D.

1955
01:06:27,690 --> 01:06:28,590
Don't die!

1956
01:06:29,510 --> 01:06:30,550
He had an AWP!

1957
01:06:30,550 --> 01:06:31,650
He had no scope.

1958
01:06:32,050 --> 01:06:33,590
He had an AWP!

1959
01:06:34,070 --> 01:06:35,290
That's not fair!

1960
01:06:37,630 --> 01:06:39,290
Okay, that guy had...

1961
01:06:39,290 --> 01:06:41,430
Yeah, yeah, that's...

1962
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:43,310
I don't even know which one was... was him.

1963
01:06:45,290 --> 01:06:45,730
Yeah.

1964
01:06:45,890 --> 01:06:47,110
Yeah, I was reloading.

1965
01:06:47,290 --> 01:06:47,850
I got out...

1966
01:06:47,850 --> 01:06:48,110
I think it's this guy.

1967
01:06:50,130 --> 01:06:50,870
Oh, my God!

1968
01:06:51,110 --> 01:06:52,590
Kill him and give me his AWP!

1969
01:06:54,090 --> 01:06:55,750
Oh, no, he's saving his AWP!

1970
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:56,810
Usually they try to save.

1971
01:06:57,350 --> 01:06:58,510
Fuckin' that pussy!

1972
01:07:01,590 --> 01:07:02,290
Yeah, I...

1973
01:07:02,290 --> 01:07:03,910
I think he's probably in T spawn or something.

1974
01:07:04,810 --> 01:07:05,630
Oh, my God.

1975
01:07:05,890 --> 01:07:06,490
That's it.

1976
01:07:06,630 --> 01:07:08,310
I'm too broke to buy an AWP.

1977
01:07:09,090 --> 01:07:09,810
Wait, maybe?

1978
01:07:10,270 --> 01:07:11,590
Here, I can buy you one.

1979
01:07:11,670 --> 01:07:12,130
I can buy you one.

1980
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:13,810
Please.

1981
01:07:14,010 --> 01:07:16,190
You can pick it up from the buy menu if you press...

1982
01:07:16,190 --> 01:07:16,250
Oh.

1983
01:07:16,250 --> 01:07:16,870
It should be at the bottom.

1984
01:07:16,870 --> 01:07:17,370
Yeah, I got it.

1985
01:07:18,410 --> 01:07:18,770
Alright.

1986
01:07:20,010 --> 01:07:20,990
Don't worry, guys.

1987
01:07:21,390 --> 01:07:23,010
I know how to smoke now.

1988
01:07:24,150 --> 01:07:24,870
I got it.

1989
01:07:24,990 --> 01:07:27,150
I got a success only one time.

1990
01:07:27,490 --> 01:07:28,550
And that's all I need.

1991
01:07:29,150 --> 01:07:30,070
Look at that!

1992
01:07:31,070 --> 01:07:31,430
I...

1993
01:07:31,430 --> 01:07:31,790
No, um...

1994
01:07:31,790 --> 01:07:32,510
Don't look at it.

1995
01:07:32,650 --> 01:07:33,490
Don't look at it.

1996
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:34,850
Don't look at it!

1997
01:07:35,410 --> 01:07:35,850
Don't look at it!

1998
01:07:35,850 --> 01:07:36,470
Don't look at it!

1999
01:07:40,330 --> 01:07:41,110
Don't look.

2000
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:46,020
Anybody in mid?

2001
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:47,000
Or...

2002
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:47,300
B-site?

2003
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:50,180
Oh, we can do long, I think.

2004
01:07:51,020 --> 01:07:51,420
Oh, no, then.

2005
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:51,920
So usually...

2006
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:52,480
Wait, where are you?

2007
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:53,800
Oh, I'm back here.

2008
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:59,140
Oh, you smoked me.

2009
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:04,400
Poked up above the top.

2010
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:07,540
Anyone mid?

2011
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:09,240
Oh, I did it!

2012
01:08:09,540 --> 01:08:09,780
Oh!

2013
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:09,860
Oh!

2014
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:11,600
I didn't shoot my gun!

2015
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:11,960
Yay!

2016
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:13,460
I did it, guys!

2017
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:15,900
I didn't shoot my gun!

2018
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:16,920
I...

2019
01:08:21,340 --> 01:08:22,620
Alright, so here...

2020
01:08:22,620 --> 01:08:25,560
You can pretty much smoke, like, any of the entry points.

2021
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:27,460
And that'll help a lot, because the smokes last...

2022
01:08:27,460 --> 01:08:28,700
Oh, okay.

2023
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:29,320
Wait.

2024
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:30,320
Yeah, so there's no...

2025
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:32,140
There's no trick smokes, really, for here.

2026
01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:33,680
Didn't we win?

2027
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:34,520
Why are we here?

2028
01:08:35,780 --> 01:08:36,920
Oh, we switched sides.

2029
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:37,440
Oh!

2030
01:08:37,740 --> 01:08:39,460
I didn't even realize we didn't play the other side.

2031
01:08:39,460 --> 01:08:41,260
I didn't even notice that.

2032
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:43,200
Yeah, it is kind of confusing.

2033
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:44,540
Now you have to shoot, uh...

2034
01:08:44,540 --> 01:08:45,680
People who are your teammates.

2035
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:46,300
Okay.

2036
01:08:47,020 --> 01:08:47,960
Like, on T-side.

2037
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:50,580
Don't worry, I'm looking at mid.

2038
01:08:54,750 --> 01:08:55,570
Oh, their cat?

2039
01:08:56,470 --> 01:08:56,830
What?

2040
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:58,310
Oh, I know where cat is.

2041
01:08:58,350 --> 01:08:58,990
Which means they're probably...

2042
01:08:58,990 --> 01:08:59,890
They're probably gonna go A.

2043
01:09:01,410 --> 01:09:02,210
There's still one more.

2044
01:09:02,210 --> 01:09:02,470
Oh, wait.

2045
01:09:02,670 --> 01:09:03,330
There's only one, so...

2046
01:09:03,330 --> 01:09:04,530
Wait, that guy had the bomb.

2047
01:09:05,910 --> 01:09:07,130
Yeah, if the bomb is...

2048
01:09:07,130 --> 01:09:09,050
Is on the floor, then we just stay by the bomb.

2049
01:09:09,130 --> 01:09:09,350
Yeah.

2050
01:09:10,050 --> 01:09:10,530
I think he...

2051
01:09:10,530 --> 01:09:12,610
Yeah, you know that from Valorant and stuff.

2052
01:09:12,610 --> 01:09:12,670
Yeah.

2053
01:09:13,450 --> 01:09:14,730
From tactical shooters.

2054
01:09:16,490 --> 01:09:17,730
Wait, where did he die?

2055
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:20,230
On cat.

2056
01:09:20,570 --> 01:09:21,690
It's like lower cat.

2057
01:09:23,590 --> 01:09:26,150
Oh, here, I'll show you this way to get up to cat if you want.

2058
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:26,470
Yeah?

2059
01:09:26,570 --> 01:09:26,610
Okay.

2060
01:09:27,370 --> 01:09:28,570
You can jump on these boxes.

2061
01:09:29,330 --> 01:09:29,470
Uh-huh.

2062
01:09:29,610 --> 01:09:29,870
Oh!

2063
01:09:29,870 --> 01:09:30,470
Oh shit, he's here.

2064
01:09:30,470 --> 01:09:31,450
Oh my god.

2065
01:09:31,450 --> 01:09:31,950
Get him!

2066
01:09:34,130 --> 01:09:34,750
That's right.

2067
01:09:35,270 --> 01:09:35,290
Oh.

2068
01:09:35,970 --> 01:09:36,690
That's not right.

2069
01:09:36,850 --> 01:09:37,390
That's not right.

2070
01:09:37,530 --> 01:09:38,090
That's not right.

2071
01:09:38,290 --> 01:09:38,390
That's not right.

2072
01:09:38,390 --> 01:09:38,850
That's not...

2073
01:09:38,850 --> 01:09:41,170
I didn't realize our teammates died.

2074
01:09:43,850 --> 01:09:44,290
Alright.

2075
01:09:44,650 --> 01:09:45,430
Follow me.

2076
01:09:46,070 --> 01:09:46,990
I'll show you.

2077
01:09:48,370 --> 01:09:48,810
Um...

2078
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:50,090
I was like, wait a minute.

2079
01:09:50,450 --> 01:09:52,110
How did these guys push up mid?

2080
01:09:52,190 --> 01:09:53,390
We had two people there.

2081
01:09:53,390 --> 01:09:55,250
I was so confused.

2082
01:09:55,430 --> 01:09:55,590
Alright.

2083
01:09:58,370 --> 01:09:59,170
Did you...

2084
01:09:59,170 --> 01:09:59,650
Buy armor?

2085
01:09:59,870 --> 01:10:00,290
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2086
01:10:01,990 --> 01:10:02,390
Okay.

2087
01:10:03,210 --> 01:10:03,430
Alright.

2088
01:10:03,750 --> 01:10:03,930
So you just...

2089
01:10:03,930 --> 01:10:05,850
You can crouch jump or regular jump.

2090
01:10:06,250 --> 01:10:06,470
Yeah.

2091
01:10:06,730 --> 01:10:07,610
And then...

2092
01:10:08,770 --> 01:10:09,410
There you go.

2093
01:10:09,610 --> 01:10:09,970
There you go.

2094
01:10:10,170 --> 01:10:10,690
And then you can...

2095
01:10:10,690 --> 01:10:12,470
Some people will like, stand here and hold.

2096
01:10:12,630 --> 01:10:12,710
Uh-huh.

2097
01:10:12,710 --> 01:10:14,310
Cause they're gonna push from mid into cat.

2098
01:10:15,230 --> 01:10:16,190
Uh, which they might do.

2099
01:10:16,270 --> 01:10:16,290
Alright.

2100
01:10:16,290 --> 01:10:16,630
Cause they gotta...

2101
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:17,550
They just gotta pick mid.

2102
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:18,950
But they might go B also.

2103
01:10:19,130 --> 01:10:20,370
Oh, they got two picks too.

2104
01:10:20,510 --> 01:10:20,970
They gotta pick B.

2105
01:10:21,910 --> 01:10:22,390
Yeah.

2106
01:10:23,290 --> 01:10:23,350
Yeah.

2107
01:10:23,350 --> 01:10:23,410
Okay.

2108
01:10:24,050 --> 01:10:24,250
Nice.

2109
01:10:24,250 --> 01:10:25,190
I had enough fun.

2110
01:10:26,950 --> 01:10:27,670
Oh no!

2111
01:10:28,610 --> 01:10:31,070
I didn't realize the second guy was there.

2112
01:10:33,530 --> 01:10:35,250
Oh, there was a guy.

2113
01:10:35,390 --> 01:10:35,810
Another guy?

2114
01:10:35,970 --> 01:10:36,250
Oh.

2115
01:10:36,910 --> 01:10:38,030
Yeah, there was two guys.

2116
01:10:38,250 --> 01:10:38,730
I'm catching up.

2117
01:10:39,610 --> 01:10:41,270
I was like, I had enough fun.

2118
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:42,650
And then I walked away.

2119
01:10:46,670 --> 01:10:47,630
Yeah, usually...

2120
01:10:47,630 --> 01:10:49,230
Do you have a BGM playing or anything?

2121
01:10:49,450 --> 01:10:49,970
Oh, no.

2122
01:10:50,230 --> 01:10:50,390
No.

2123
01:10:52,090 --> 01:10:52,850
Okay, that's good.

2124
01:10:53,010 --> 01:10:53,970
Yeah, cause sometimes...

2125
01:10:53,970 --> 01:10:55,330
Like, you can hear their footsteps.

2126
01:10:55,750 --> 01:10:55,910
Yeah.

2127
01:10:56,550 --> 01:10:56,910
I have to...

2128
01:10:56,910 --> 01:10:58,670
I don't know the sounds as well.

2129
01:10:58,950 --> 01:10:59,070
It's pretty quiet.

2130
01:10:59,390 --> 01:11:00,610
As well, so like...

2131
01:11:00,610 --> 01:11:02,710
It's harder to hear, for instance, I can't...

2132
01:11:02,710 --> 01:11:05,390
You know like when you play a game so much, you can instantly...

2133
01:11:06,510 --> 01:11:06,830
Um...

2134
01:11:06,830 --> 01:11:07,910
Recognize the sounds.

2135
01:11:08,130 --> 01:11:09,590
But it's just by instinct and stuff.

2136
01:11:10,810 --> 01:11:12,130
So for me, I haven't...

2137
01:11:12,130 --> 01:11:12,970
Yeah, I know what you mean, yeah.

2138
01:11:13,090 --> 01:11:13,250
Yeah.

2139
01:11:13,450 --> 01:11:14,690
I haven't picked up on it yet.

2140
01:11:17,130 --> 01:11:21,570
Yeah, in this game, the CTs, like your teammates have pretty quiet footsteps.

2141
01:11:21,890 --> 01:11:22,850
Like whoever's your teammate.

2142
01:11:23,110 --> 01:11:23,150
Yeah.

2143
01:11:23,470 --> 01:11:24,690
And then the enemy team's...

2144
01:11:24,690 --> 01:11:25,610
It's gonna be way louder.

2145
01:11:25,790 --> 01:11:26,130
They're mid.

2146
01:11:26,630 --> 01:11:27,290
They pushed up mid.

2147
01:11:27,690 --> 01:11:27,710
They're mid?

2148
01:11:27,710 --> 01:11:27,990
Okay.

2149
01:11:27,990 --> 01:11:28,070
Okay.

2150
01:11:29,110 --> 01:11:29,790
And then...

2151
01:11:29,790 --> 01:11:30,350
They're going B.

2152
01:11:31,110 --> 01:11:31,630
Okay.

2153
01:11:31,930 --> 01:11:32,890
Oh, they're planning.

2154
01:11:34,750 --> 01:11:36,050
You think I could just be here?

2155
01:11:36,870 --> 01:11:37,390
Oh!

2156
01:11:37,610 --> 01:11:38,650
I think they heard me.

2157
01:11:39,770 --> 01:11:40,290
Um...

2158
01:11:40,290 --> 01:11:40,650
I think...

2159
01:11:40,650 --> 01:11:41,010
Oh shoot.

2160
01:11:41,910 --> 01:11:43,370
We've died at the same time.

2161
01:11:43,570 --> 01:11:43,750
Yeah.

2162
01:11:44,010 --> 01:11:45,470
They definitely heard me.

2163
01:11:46,450 --> 01:11:48,990
Is there like quiet jumping or...

2164
01:11:50,550 --> 01:11:52,570
I don't think so.

2165
01:11:53,790 --> 01:11:55,170
Chat, is there quiet jumping?

2166
01:11:55,590 --> 01:11:56,350
No, I don't think so.

2167
01:11:56,350 --> 01:11:57,370
I just...

2168
01:11:57,370 --> 01:11:57,850
I fall...

2169
01:11:57,850 --> 01:11:59,450
Fall down and I wouldn't...

2170
01:11:59,450 --> 01:12:00,050
I go like...

2171
01:12:00,050 --> 01:12:00,550
Splat.

2172
01:12:00,710 --> 01:12:01,530
And then I was like, okay.

2173
01:12:01,810 --> 01:12:02,370
Thank you.

2174
01:12:02,810 --> 01:12:03,890
I mean...

2175
01:12:03,890 --> 01:12:04,490
Yeah.

2176
01:12:04,670 --> 01:12:05,150
I can't...

2177
01:12:05,150 --> 01:12:06,370
I can't be sneaky.

2178
01:12:08,790 --> 01:12:11,090
I don't know how to be sneaky, guys.

2179
01:12:12,990 --> 01:12:14,350
Yeah, I can't jump down...

2180
01:12:15,270 --> 01:12:15,710
Quietly.

2181
01:12:17,230 --> 01:12:18,570
I don't think there's anybody pushing...

2182
01:12:18,570 --> 01:12:19,330
Oh, one's pushing cat.

2183
01:12:19,390 --> 01:12:20,110
He's pushing you right now.

2184
01:12:20,550 --> 01:12:21,170
Don't worry.

2185
01:12:21,190 --> 01:12:21,970
I got this.

2186
01:12:22,830 --> 01:12:23,990
I didn't get this.

2187
01:12:23,990 --> 01:12:24,370
On.

2188
01:12:26,210 --> 01:12:26,690
Okay.

2189
01:12:26,790 --> 01:12:27,450
It's just one guy.

2190
01:12:29,370 --> 01:12:29,850
Thing.

2191
01:12:30,310 --> 01:12:30,550
Right?

2192
01:12:30,670 --> 01:12:31,030
Or was...

2193
01:12:31,030 --> 01:12:32,310
What the hell?

2194
01:12:32,590 --> 01:12:33,290
Where did he come from?

2195
01:12:33,510 --> 01:12:34,110
I didn't...

2196
01:12:34,110 --> 01:12:35,550
That's the guy that killed me.

2197
01:12:37,250 --> 01:12:37,970
It's him.

2198
01:12:42,850 --> 01:12:44,030
Alright, we won the round.

2199
01:12:44,150 --> 01:12:45,070
Yeah, we did it, guys.

2200
01:12:45,070 --> 01:12:46,250
Only the two of us died.

2201
01:12:46,750 --> 01:12:47,110
Yeah.

2202
01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:47,910
We're...

2203
01:12:47,910 --> 01:12:49,710
We're contributing, guys.

2204
01:12:50,450 --> 01:12:50,630
Oh.

2205
01:12:52,670 --> 01:12:54,070
It's not fair.

2206
01:12:54,490 --> 01:12:55,310
He's running while...

2207
01:12:55,310 --> 01:12:56,710
Yeah, without a sacrifice, they wouldn't have known the location.

2208
01:12:56,750 --> 01:12:57,330
Exactly.

2209
01:12:57,690 --> 01:12:58,010
Exactly.

2210
01:12:58,010 --> 01:12:58,850
We were...

2211
01:12:58,850 --> 01:13:00,270
We're tactical bait.

2212
01:13:00,730 --> 01:13:01,690
For our team.

2213
01:13:02,490 --> 01:13:02,990
That's it.

2214
01:13:03,050 --> 01:13:03,690
I'm running forward.

2215
01:13:04,090 --> 01:13:04,470
Mm-hmm.

2216
01:13:05,930 --> 01:13:06,650
That's it.

2217
01:13:07,030 --> 01:13:07,330
Oh.

2218
01:13:08,030 --> 01:13:08,510
I'm running.

2219
01:13:08,730 --> 01:13:10,310
You have an expensive gun, you better not lose it.

2220
01:13:10,310 --> 01:13:11,270
I'm gonna lose it.

2221
01:13:11,270 --> 01:13:11,810
You're gonna ruin our economy.

2222
01:13:11,810 --> 01:13:12,350
Pick up my gun...

2223
01:13:12,350 --> 01:13:14,170
Pick up my gun after I die.

2224
01:13:16,010 --> 01:13:16,390
Okay.

2225
01:13:17,410 --> 01:13:18,250
Alright, I'll do that.

2226
01:13:18,610 --> 01:13:19,990
Yeah, stand behind me.

2227
01:13:20,230 --> 01:13:20,270
One long.

2228
01:13:20,270 --> 01:13:20,490
One long.

2229
01:13:21,410 --> 01:13:22,110
There we go.

2230
01:13:22,290 --> 01:13:23,070
Oh, I have the bomb.

2231
01:13:24,250 --> 01:13:25,010
Oh, they're gonna...

2232
01:13:25,010 --> 01:13:25,830
They're gonna come up from...

2233
01:13:25,830 --> 01:13:26,490
Okay, I...

2234
01:13:26,490 --> 01:13:27,710
They're gonna come up from your left side.

2235
01:13:28,010 --> 01:13:28,350
There...

2236
01:13:28,350 --> 01:13:29,130
There's two of them.

2237
01:13:30,850 --> 01:13:32,150
I had two of them on me.

2238
01:13:34,230 --> 01:13:35,530
I did my job.

2239
01:13:36,970 --> 01:13:37,350
You...

2240
01:13:37,350 --> 01:13:38,430
For your crosshair...

2241
01:13:38,990 --> 01:13:40,450
If you see, like, any of our teammates' crosshairs...

2242
01:13:41,110 --> 01:13:41,510
Um...

2243
01:13:41,510 --> 01:13:42,470
You can always copy them.

2244
01:13:42,750 --> 01:13:43,030
They're so tiny.

2245
01:13:43,030 --> 01:13:43,710
Oh, yeah, okay.

2246
01:13:43,990 --> 01:13:44,870
Oh, so it's just like...

2247
01:13:44,870 --> 01:13:45,190
Yeah.

2248
01:13:45,810 --> 01:13:46,570
They're so tiny.

2249
01:13:46,890 --> 01:13:47,830
Look how tiny they're crosshairs.

2250
01:13:47,830 --> 01:13:48,690
Unless you like yours.

2251
01:13:48,850 --> 01:13:50,270
Yeah, you probably know how you like yours.

2252
01:13:50,770 --> 01:13:51,410
I don't know.

2253
01:13:51,450 --> 01:13:52,690
I just did a random crosshair.

2254
01:13:52,930 --> 01:13:52,990
Cute.

2255
01:13:53,990 --> 01:13:54,970
I got my one.

2256
01:13:55,290 --> 01:13:55,310
Yeah.

2257
01:13:55,310 --> 01:13:55,950
I, uh...

2258
01:13:55,950 --> 01:13:57,590
I recently copied mine.

2259
01:13:57,770 --> 01:13:59,690
And then when I'm in a lobby with other people...

2260
01:13:59,690 --> 01:14:00,310
Or, like, uh...

2261
01:14:00,310 --> 01:14:01,330
On a regular game...

2262
01:14:01,330 --> 01:14:01,350
Yeah.

2263
01:14:01,350 --> 01:14:02,610
People will copy my crosshair.

2264
01:14:02,770 --> 01:14:03,250
Cause it's...

2265
01:14:03,250 --> 01:14:04,470
It's like a T crosshair.

2266
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:05,130
Uh-huh.

2267
01:14:05,130 --> 01:14:05,810
Uh, so...

2268
01:14:05,810 --> 01:14:07,890
It's missing, like, the fourth one at the very top.

2269
01:14:08,750 --> 01:14:08,830
Oh.

2270
01:14:09,690 --> 01:14:10,570
Cause, like, you can put...

2271
01:14:10,570 --> 01:14:11,990
You can put their heads on a platter.

2272
01:14:12,090 --> 01:14:12,650
And then shoot.

2273
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:13,630
I see.

2274
01:14:14,910 --> 01:14:15,270
Okay.

2275
01:14:15,270 --> 01:14:15,570
I don't know.

2276
01:14:15,630 --> 01:14:16,350
Maybe it'd be weird.

2277
01:14:16,810 --> 01:14:17,070
Uh-huh.

2278
01:14:18,370 --> 01:14:18,730
Okay.

2279
01:14:18,730 --> 01:14:19,810
I'm just testing out the gun.

2280
01:14:19,870 --> 01:14:21,170
I have the MP5.

2281
01:14:21,430 --> 01:14:22,450
I don't know if that's a good gun.

2282
01:14:23,730 --> 01:14:24,090
Yeah.

2283
01:14:24,530 --> 01:14:24,850
Yeah.

2284
01:14:25,010 --> 01:14:26,390
People will really hate that gun.

2285
01:14:26,670 --> 01:14:26,830
Oh.

2286
01:14:28,210 --> 01:14:29,190
It's all I could afford.

2287
01:14:29,210 --> 01:14:31,270
No, cause they're like, That's the worst gun in the game.

2288
01:14:31,510 --> 01:14:31,870
Aww.

2289
01:14:33,170 --> 01:14:33,530
Aww.

2290
01:14:34,270 --> 01:14:35,710
No, I like it though.

2291
01:14:35,810 --> 01:14:36,330
I like it.

2292
01:14:36,410 --> 01:14:36,550
Okay.

2293
01:14:36,590 --> 01:14:37,890
I'm gonna go die, I guess.

2294
01:14:38,170 --> 01:14:40,670
They're pushing mid, so you could probably push...

2295
01:14:41,250 --> 01:14:42,110
You can push Pat down.

2296
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:42,430
Okay.

2297
01:14:44,790 --> 01:14:46,030
I hit him.

2298
01:14:46,170 --> 01:14:46,870
I hit him.

2299
01:14:47,810 --> 01:14:50,010
I hit him.

2300
01:14:50,730 --> 01:14:51,230
Yeah.

2301
01:14:51,890 --> 01:14:52,390
Okay.

2302
01:14:52,710 --> 01:14:56,990
Well, my excuse was that I didn't know I had one of the worst guns.

2303
01:15:01,670 --> 01:15:02,530
Oh, shit.

2304
01:15:02,710 --> 01:15:04,550
They're B, aren't they?

2305
01:15:04,770 --> 01:15:05,670
I believe in you.

2306
01:15:06,350 --> 01:15:07,270
Yeah, they are.

2307
01:15:07,270 --> 01:15:08,070
No.

2308
01:15:08,350 --> 01:15:09,190
I'm so lit.

2309
01:15:09,410 --> 01:15:10,290
It's so over.

2310
01:15:10,610 --> 01:15:11,190
It's okay.

2311
01:15:11,530 --> 01:15:12,290
I'm just gonna push this way.

2312
01:15:12,530 --> 01:15:12,810
Just nade yourself.

2313
01:15:13,270 --> 01:15:13,350
Yeah.

2314
01:15:15,590 --> 01:15:16,570
Nade myself?

2315
01:15:17,070 --> 01:15:17,330
Yeah.

2316
01:15:18,270 --> 01:15:19,830
Die on your own terms.

2317
01:15:22,050 --> 01:15:22,570
Yeah.

2318
01:15:23,630 --> 01:15:24,930
I should've done that.

2319
01:15:25,410 --> 01:15:26,090
Oh, wait.

2320
01:15:26,150 --> 01:15:27,170
I'm not bottom...

2321
01:15:27,170 --> 01:15:28,090
Oh, I am bottom frag.

2322
01:15:28,310 --> 01:15:28,450
Wait.

2323
01:15:28,510 --> 01:15:29,310
How am I higher?

2324
01:15:29,990 --> 01:15:31,710
Why am I not bottom frag?

2325
01:15:33,170 --> 01:15:35,830
Oh, um, so it goes by damage done.

2326
01:15:36,150 --> 01:15:36,510
Oh.

2327
01:15:36,510 --> 01:15:37,130
Instead of kills.

2328
01:15:37,570 --> 01:15:38,410
Oh, I see.

2329
01:15:38,810 --> 01:15:38,970
Yeah.

2330
01:15:39,750 --> 01:15:40,670
Okay, what gun...

2331
01:15:40,670 --> 01:15:43,930
You used to get points, like, if you could plant the bomb, so...

2332
01:15:43,930 --> 01:15:44,110
Yeah?

2333
01:15:44,390 --> 01:15:47,090
I wouldn't be getting kills, but I'd be planting the bomb.

2334
01:15:47,610 --> 01:15:47,790
Oh, okay.

2335
01:15:47,790 --> 01:15:49,390
So I'd be, like, towards the top.

2336
01:15:49,790 --> 01:15:50,210
Oh, that's...

2337
01:15:50,210 --> 01:15:51,230
Oh, yeah, they changed it.

2338
01:15:52,690 --> 01:15:55,910
Oh, the guy doesn't trust me on mid anymore.

2339
01:15:55,970 --> 01:15:56,910
That's a good idea.

2340
01:15:57,030 --> 01:15:57,870
That's a good choice.

2341
01:15:58,510 --> 01:15:59,330
Mr. Nova.

2342
01:16:00,850 --> 01:16:02,150
You shouldn't trust me.

2343
01:16:02,270 --> 01:16:03,810
Yeah, they smoked mid, so I think they're gonna go cat.

2344
01:16:04,590 --> 01:16:04,910
Okay.

2345
01:16:06,230 --> 01:16:06,870
Don't worry.

2346
01:16:07,030 --> 01:16:08,290
I'm gonna use Nova as bait.

2347
01:16:09,530 --> 01:16:09,930
Oh.

2348
01:16:10,190 --> 01:16:10,590
Okay.

2349
01:16:11,190 --> 01:16:11,590
Nevermind.

2350
01:16:13,770 --> 01:16:14,370
Oh, shoot.

2351
01:16:14,370 --> 01:16:15,030
Are they pushing you there?

2352
01:16:15,310 --> 01:16:16,130
I don't know.

2353
01:16:17,190 --> 01:16:18,350
Oh, they're long.

2354
01:16:18,530 --> 01:16:18,990
They're long.

2355
01:16:19,150 --> 01:16:19,770
Behind you.

2356
01:16:19,930 --> 01:16:20,690
I got one of them.

2357
01:16:25,590 --> 01:16:25,990
Oh.

2358
01:16:26,150 --> 01:16:26,830
Oh my god.

2359
01:16:26,830 --> 01:16:27,650
I don't know this guy.

2360
01:16:27,950 --> 01:16:28,830
If you want to back up.

2361
01:16:29,070 --> 01:16:29,830
You don't have to peek him.

2362
01:16:29,930 --> 01:16:30,470
You don't have to peek him.

2363
01:16:31,190 --> 01:16:31,590
Okay.

2364
01:16:33,670 --> 01:16:37,950
Yeah, he might go around long on the other side since that's where he came from originally.

2365
01:16:38,690 --> 01:16:41,470
But yeah, you watch that and then the teammate, he's gonna watch the other side.

2366
01:16:41,590 --> 01:16:41,750
Okay.

2367
01:16:42,230 --> 01:16:43,530
There's also better guns on the floor.

2368
01:16:43,650 --> 01:16:44,570
There's an AWP and an AK.

2369
01:16:45,050 --> 01:16:45,930
Or just an AK.

2370
01:16:46,610 --> 01:16:47,270
Oh my god.

2371
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:47,850
I'm scared.

2372
01:16:48,290 --> 01:16:48,730
I'm so...

2373
01:16:49,210 --> 01:16:49,590
He's here.

2374
01:16:49,690 --> 01:16:49,870
He's here.

2375
01:16:50,050 --> 01:16:50,430
You got him.

2376
01:16:50,710 --> 01:16:51,330
I'm so scared to look behind.

2377
01:16:51,330 --> 01:16:51,750
One more.

2378
01:16:51,750 --> 01:16:51,770
One more.

2379
01:16:55,020 --> 01:16:59,580
This guy could come from tunnels, so orange might die, but...

2380
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:00,840
Maybe not.

2381
01:17:01,060 --> 01:17:01,400
Maybe not.

2382
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:01,500
Maybe not.

2383
01:17:09,430 --> 01:17:10,190
Oh my god!

2384
01:17:10,490 --> 01:17:10,730
No!

2385
01:17:10,870 --> 01:17:11,090
I quit!

2386
01:17:11,270 --> 01:17:11,410
Oh!

2387
01:17:12,810 --> 01:17:15,650
I didn't realize our guy was gonna die there!

2388
01:17:15,650 --> 01:17:16,550
No!

2389
01:17:17,090 --> 01:17:17,430
Yeah.

2390
01:17:18,010 --> 01:17:19,690
I trusted him!

2391
01:17:20,430 --> 01:17:22,210
I trusted him!

2392
01:17:22,210 --> 01:17:26,510
You both had AWP and you were both watching like different angles.

2393
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:26,890
Yeah.

2394
01:17:28,290 --> 01:17:29,090
Oh my god!

2395
01:17:29,290 --> 01:17:31,650
And he came from tunnels, I'm pretty sure.

2396
01:17:32,070 --> 01:17:32,890
Oh my god!

2397
01:17:33,210 --> 01:17:35,370
So, it's like he left one side wide open.

2398
01:17:35,370 --> 01:17:37,540
I can't believe he was also AWPing.

2399
01:17:38,030 --> 01:17:40,530
I was like, don't worry, I got us.

2400
01:17:42,530 --> 01:17:44,230
I can't believe it.

2401
01:17:44,250 --> 01:17:44,890
There's one long.

2402
01:17:46,270 --> 01:17:46,670
Okay.

2403
01:17:47,690 --> 01:17:49,030
I'm looking at Kat.

2404
01:17:50,150 --> 01:17:51,150
Wait, mid.

2405
01:17:51,310 --> 01:17:51,570
Sorry.

2406
01:17:51,910 --> 01:17:52,030
Wait.

2407
01:17:53,390 --> 01:17:55,010
There's two pushing long.

2408
01:17:55,190 --> 01:17:55,830
It's bomb two.

2409
01:17:57,270 --> 01:17:58,510
Oh no, I'm scared.

2410
01:18:00,490 --> 01:18:01,830
There's someone in mid though.

2411
01:18:04,410 --> 01:18:07,230
Your teammate's in mid, so I think it should be okay.

2412
01:18:07,910 --> 01:18:08,510
That's unlucky.

2413
01:18:08,830 --> 01:18:09,890
That was a nice try though.

2414
01:18:09,990 --> 01:18:10,930
That was two people.

2415
01:18:11,350 --> 01:18:12,670
Not bottom frag!

2416
01:18:13,010 --> 01:18:13,590
Let's go!

2417
01:18:16,570 --> 01:18:17,610
Wait, is this?

2418
01:18:17,990 --> 01:18:18,850
Me too!

2419
01:18:19,350 --> 01:18:19,730
For now.

2420
01:18:20,070 --> 01:18:21,030
Is this T-sided?

2421
01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:26,850
People always say that most maps are T-sided.

2422
01:18:27,990 --> 01:18:30,130
So I think it is T-sided.

2423
01:18:30,390 --> 01:18:30,510
Yeah.

2424
01:18:30,510 --> 01:18:31,110
Oh.

2425
01:18:31,290 --> 01:18:34,550
It's easier to like, push with five people in one spot.

2426
01:18:34,750 --> 01:18:35,490
I see.

2427
01:18:35,810 --> 01:18:37,030
When CT's are all spread out.

2428
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:37,930
Oh my god, that guy.

2429
01:18:38,110 --> 01:18:38,330
Oh nice!

2430
01:18:38,450 --> 01:18:39,410
That was a good head shot.

2431
01:18:40,290 --> 01:18:41,030
Don't die here.

2432
01:18:42,370 --> 01:18:42,690
Oh!

2433
01:18:44,390 --> 01:18:45,350
Lucky clutch!

2434
01:18:45,450 --> 01:18:46,090
Clutch or kick!

2435
01:18:47,290 --> 01:18:48,370
He clutched it!

2436
01:18:49,370 --> 01:18:49,850
Nice.

2437
01:18:51,090 --> 01:18:53,350
That was actually a good, good shot.

2438
01:18:54,630 --> 01:18:55,390
Wait, did we win?

2439
01:18:55,610 --> 01:18:56,490
Oh wait, no.

2440
01:18:57,730 --> 01:18:57,970
Ah!

2441
01:18:58,690 --> 01:18:59,570
Okay, you know what?

2442
01:18:59,710 --> 01:19:00,390
I've been transferred.

2443
01:19:01,630 --> 01:19:01,990
I...

2444
01:19:03,390 --> 01:19:04,810
I believe in the P-20.

2445
01:19:05,190 --> 01:19:06,270
Those guys were so good.

2446
01:19:06,450 --> 01:19:07,610
That guy was so good in P-20.

2447
01:19:08,470 --> 01:19:09,970
I think I can replicate it.

2448
01:19:10,210 --> 01:19:11,410
Grab your gear, let's go.

2449
01:19:13,510 --> 01:19:14,650
I can replicate it.

2450
01:19:14,650 --> 01:19:14,730
I'll be him.

2451
01:19:14,730 --> 01:19:14,830
Wait, wait.

2452
01:19:14,890 --> 01:19:15,510
Where are you gonna go with that?

2453
01:19:15,610 --> 01:19:16,110
You're gonna go cat?

2454
01:19:16,390 --> 01:19:17,410
Yeah, I'll be like him.

2455
01:19:18,190 --> 01:19:19,510
And now I just rush through, right?

2456
01:19:19,650 --> 01:19:19,970
Okay.

2457
01:19:20,610 --> 01:19:21,250
I just run?

2458
01:19:21,410 --> 01:19:22,070
With the P-20?

2459
01:19:22,770 --> 01:19:23,090
What?

2460
01:19:23,730 --> 01:19:25,130
Yeah, you just run with P-20.

2461
01:19:25,670 --> 01:19:26,310
Yeah, yeah.

2462
01:19:26,650 --> 01:19:27,630
I'll cover you, I'll cover you.

2463
01:19:27,690 --> 01:19:28,270
Yeah, yeah.

2464
01:19:28,510 --> 01:19:29,530
I have no HP.

2465
01:19:31,470 --> 01:19:32,310
That's right, I'm running.

2466
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:37,700
Okay, we're both bad.

2467
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:39,980
We're both bad.

2468
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:44,600
Oh, yay!

2469
01:19:45,260 --> 01:19:47,180
Nice, you just need one more round to win.

2470
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:48,040
And then we're...

2471
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:49,400
I did...

2472
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:49,900
83.

2473
01:19:50,180 --> 01:19:51,300
Okay, I did 83.

2474
01:19:52,820 --> 01:19:54,080
83 damage there.

2475
01:19:55,060 --> 01:19:55,720
Okay, it's just...

2476
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:55,940
Alright.

2477
01:19:55,940 --> 01:19:57,520
I think I found my gun.

2478
01:19:57,700 --> 01:19:58,160
I...

2479
01:19:58,160 --> 01:19:59,500
I remember I used the P-20 in...

2480
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:00,360
in T-T-T.

2481
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:01,500
I...

2482
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:02,300
I...

2483
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:03,680
T-T...

2484
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:05,560
Yeah, in Trouble in Terroristown.

2485
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:09,180
The P-P-90 was always my go-to gun.

2486
01:20:12,580 --> 01:20:13,560
It's just like T-T-T.

2487
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:14,520
I like that one.

2488
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:16,860
Pretty much.

2489
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:17,500
Pretty much.

2490
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:17,540
Pretty much.

2491
01:20:19,340 --> 01:20:20,720
Oh, I think they're going B.

2492
01:20:20,820 --> 01:20:21,760
I think they did a B-Rush.

2493
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:24,880
Okay.

2494
01:20:25,780 --> 01:20:26,500
Don't worry.

2495
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:28,620
I'll walk all the way behind them.

2496
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:31,880
You won't know.

2497
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:33,540
No way!

2498
01:20:33,860 --> 01:20:35,040
There's one guy sitting car.

2499
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:35,620
Oh.

2500
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,840
Oh my god, I hope everybody lives.

2501
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:38,620
Oh, you pull out your knife.

2502
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:39,600
Uh...

2503
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:41,560
Yeah, I'll go faster, but I'm scared too.

2504
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:43,400
No!

2505
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:44,540
It's a 1v1.

2506
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:45,240
No.

2507
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:45,980
I'll let you focus.

2508
01:20:46,180 --> 01:20:46,740
No way.

2509
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:50,540
No way.

2510
01:20:50,540 --> 01:20:51,160
Yeah.

2511
01:20:54,940 --> 01:20:56,400
They didn't plan though.

2512
01:20:58,580 --> 01:20:59,760
I think they're bad too.

2513
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:04,200
I hear them.

2514
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:09,080
Wait, what?!

2515
01:21:10,660 --> 01:21:11,140
That's...

2516
01:21:11,140 --> 01:21:12,060
They were playing weird.

2517
01:21:12,220 --> 01:21:14,740
Is that the person who wanted you to shout them out?

2518
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:15,000
No!

2519
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:15,640
Yeah, it wasn't.

2520
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:16,540
Wait, I...

2521
01:21:16,540 --> 01:21:17,120
Oh my god.

2522
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:18,120
I hit 80?!

2523
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:19,480
Awww!

2524
01:21:20,580 --> 01:21:21,100
Awww.

2525
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:22,600
Awww.

2526
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:24,540
I have to aim higher.

2527
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:25,260
Awww.

2528
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:28,200
Okay, maybe P90's not my gun.

2529
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:29,040
But it's a...

2530
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:32,440
It's really normal for...

2531
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:34,060
for it to be like...

2532
01:21:34,740 --> 01:21:35,660
crosshair placement.

2533
01:21:36,040 --> 01:21:38,020
A lot of times for new players, it's like pretty bad.

2534
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:40,800
You have to constantly try to keep your crosshair head level.

2535
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:41,440
Awww.

2536
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:43,020
Even for the P90?

2537
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:43,680
Yeah.

2538
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:44,520
Awww.

2539
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:45,360
Yeah.

2540
01:21:45,780 --> 01:21:46,460
Okay, yeah.

2541
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:47,120
It was just spring.

2542
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:50,760
Every gun you wanna start out shooting at the head, and then...

2543
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:51,920
they're all long.

2544
01:21:52,860 --> 01:21:53,100
Oh.

2545
01:21:53,380 --> 01:21:55,820
And then you drag down, usually, for the recoil.

2546
01:21:59,410 --> 01:22:00,630
Wait, is there no one cat?

2547
01:22:06,730 --> 01:22:07,830
There's two over here.

2548
01:22:08,070 --> 01:22:08,330
Goose.

2549
01:22:08,410 --> 01:22:09,150
There's one in Goose.

2550
01:22:09,890 --> 01:22:10,310
Oh!

2551
01:22:15,450 --> 01:22:16,450
Oh, I see.

2552
01:22:16,910 --> 01:22:17,310
I see.

2553
01:22:17,410 --> 01:22:18,970
Wait, people are saying I should try the...

2554
01:22:18,970 --> 01:22:19,790
to follow recoil.

2555
01:22:20,130 --> 01:22:20,570
Toots.

2556
01:22:20,570 --> 01:22:21,270
Oh my god.

2557
01:22:21,850 --> 01:22:22,530
Oh, yeah.

2558
01:22:22,770 --> 01:22:23,710
It's not terrible.

2559
01:22:24,090 --> 01:22:24,470
I...

2560
01:22:24,470 --> 01:22:24,670
I...

2561
01:22:24,670 --> 01:22:25,430
I kind of like it.

2562
01:22:25,630 --> 01:22:26,070
Oh, yeah.

2563
01:22:26,210 --> 01:22:26,850
I'll try it.

2564
01:22:27,590 --> 01:22:28,250
Don't worry.

2565
01:22:28,450 --> 01:22:29,110
Oh, I don't...

2566
01:22:29,110 --> 01:22:29,790
I don't have P90.

2567
01:22:30,050 --> 01:22:30,510
I'm broke.

2568
01:22:30,750 --> 01:22:31,310
I've just been...

2569
01:22:31,310 --> 01:22:33,430
I have not been paying attention to my economy.

2570
01:22:35,890 --> 01:22:36,610
It happens.

2571
01:22:37,950 --> 01:22:38,810
Alright, I have the...

2572
01:22:38,810 --> 01:22:39,910
We have to win this one.

2573
01:22:40,130 --> 01:22:41,650
So, try not to peak like...

2574
01:22:41,650 --> 01:22:42,870
crazy angles.

2575
01:22:43,390 --> 01:22:43,630
Okay.

2576
01:22:43,930 --> 01:22:45,070
I'll play more safe.

2577
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:50,880
Hello.

2578
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:51,580
Grenade.

2579
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:55,020
I don't know where to play.

2580
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:55,940
They might be pushing mid.

2581
01:22:56,120 --> 01:22:56,620
They're pushing mid.

2582
01:22:57,560 --> 01:22:57,880
Oh.

2583
01:22:58,140 --> 01:22:58,440
Okay.

2584
01:22:58,960 --> 01:22:59,680
I got one.

2585
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:00,980
Grenade out.

2586
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:03,100
Alright, one's lit going up to B.

2587
01:23:03,220 --> 01:23:03,820
They're going B.

2588
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:04,480
Oh.

2589
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:04,960
Looks like.

2590
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:08,080
Nobody here.

2591
01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:08,820
I want to see this guy.

2592
01:23:08,820 --> 01:23:09,340
Why would that guy?

2593
01:23:13,050 --> 01:23:13,870
Yeah, I think...

2594
01:23:13,870 --> 01:23:14,290
Oh, we have...

2595
01:23:14,290 --> 01:23:14,790
You have bomb.

2596
01:23:14,790 --> 01:23:15,970
It's underneath cat right now.

2597
01:23:16,250 --> 01:23:16,690
So...

2598
01:23:16,690 --> 01:23:17,030
Oh.

2599
01:23:18,850 --> 01:23:20,610
Where you are now, they might...

2600
01:23:20,610 --> 01:23:22,050
They might go that way.

2601
01:23:22,190 --> 01:23:23,570
But like, where the tunnel is...

2602
01:23:23,570 --> 01:23:23,830
Here?

2603
01:23:24,870 --> 01:23:25,990
Oh, we did it!

2604
01:23:26,290 --> 01:23:26,810
We did it!

2605
01:23:27,050 --> 01:23:27,370
Yay!

2606
01:23:27,790 --> 01:23:28,250
Woo!

2607
01:23:28,250 --> 01:23:28,650
Woo!

2608
01:23:29,530 --> 01:23:29,790
Woo!

2609
01:23:30,670 --> 01:23:31,490
Oh my god!

2610
01:23:31,670 --> 01:23:31,850
Wait!

2611
01:23:32,130 --> 01:23:32,790
What did I get?

2612
01:23:32,930 --> 01:23:33,750
Most time alive!

2613
01:23:34,110 --> 01:23:34,510
Let's go!

2614
01:23:36,930 --> 01:23:37,530
That's good!

2615
01:23:37,630 --> 01:23:38,030
That's good!

2616
01:23:38,030 --> 01:23:39,230
Oh my god!

2617
01:23:39,490 --> 01:23:39,910
Let's go!

2618
01:23:40,770 --> 01:23:43,310
I've been alive for so long!

2619
01:23:44,130 --> 01:23:44,990
Let's go!

2620
01:23:45,730 --> 01:23:47,030
Not bottom frag!

2621
01:23:47,290 --> 01:23:47,930
Let's go!

2622
01:23:48,910 --> 01:23:50,030
You know, technically...

2623
01:23:50,710 --> 01:23:51,630
Wait a second.

2624
01:23:51,790 --> 01:23:51,910
I'm...

2625
01:23:51,910 --> 01:23:52,350
Shoot!

2626
01:23:53,670 --> 01:23:54,350
Yeah!

2627
01:23:54,590 --> 01:23:55,930
Like one kill away.

2628
01:23:56,290 --> 01:23:57,750
My KDA is so bad.

2629
01:24:00,110 --> 01:24:01,070
Yeah, mine too.

2630
01:24:01,550 --> 01:24:02,990
I have 19 deaths.

2631
01:24:03,170 --> 01:24:06,110
Here in this game, I think it's ADR?

2632
01:24:06,450 --> 01:24:06,910
ADR?

2633
01:24:06,910 --> 01:24:08,750
What does ADR stands for?

2634
01:24:09,050 --> 01:24:10,370
Assist, death, and...

2635
01:24:10,370 --> 01:24:11,110
What the fuck is R?

2636
01:24:11,110 --> 01:24:12,310
Assist, death, ratio maybe?

2637
01:24:12,630 --> 01:24:12,930
Assist...

2638
01:24:12,930 --> 01:24:13,190
Oh!

2639
01:24:13,730 --> 01:24:14,610
Okay, so it's just...

2640
01:24:14,610 --> 01:24:16,130
Assist and death.

2641
01:24:16,690 --> 01:24:18,490
Instead of like K, it kills and death.

2642
01:24:19,370 --> 01:24:19,670
Poor...

2643
01:24:19,670 --> 01:24:20,370
No, he has...

2644
01:24:20,370 --> 01:24:20,470
Oh!

2645
01:24:20,470 --> 01:24:21,830
Average damage per round.

2646
01:24:22,290 --> 01:24:22,790
Oh!

2647
01:24:23,170 --> 01:24:24,290
Okay, that makes more sense.

2648
01:24:25,450 --> 01:24:25,950
Yay!

2649
01:24:26,710 --> 01:24:29,050
My average damage was not that bad.

2650
01:24:31,630 --> 01:24:32,030
Yay!

2651
01:24:32,330 --> 01:24:33,870
Do you wanna play another one?

2652
01:24:33,870 --> 01:24:34,670
Let's do another one.

2653
01:24:34,710 --> 01:24:35,610
Do you wanna switch now?

2654
01:24:35,610 --> 01:24:36,890
Yeah, that was fun.

2655
01:24:37,070 --> 01:24:37,890
Let's do another one.

2656
01:24:39,110 --> 01:24:39,950
That was fun.

2657
01:24:40,370 --> 01:24:41,230
Yeah, it's kind of addictive.

2658
01:24:41,410 --> 01:24:42,330
Especially if you...

2659
01:24:42,330 --> 01:24:44,730
If you're like in a 1v1 and you get the clutch.

2660
01:24:45,190 --> 01:24:45,230
Yeah.

2661
01:24:45,230 --> 01:24:46,210
Yeah, the clutch or kick.

2662
01:24:46,530 --> 01:24:47,310
We also had...

2663
01:24:47,310 --> 01:24:50,230
Our top fragger had like 31 plus kills.

2664
01:24:50,390 --> 01:24:51,730
I think he carried us.

2665
01:24:52,510 --> 01:24:52,710
Sorry.

2666
01:24:54,570 --> 01:24:55,350
Yeah, yeah.

2667
01:24:55,470 --> 01:24:57,670
We did get carried a little bit.

2668
01:24:58,010 --> 01:24:58,710
But it's good.

2669
01:24:58,790 --> 01:24:59,110
It's nice.

2670
01:24:59,110 --> 01:24:59,610
Yeah, yeah.

2671
01:24:59,750 --> 01:25:00,430
Look, we're...

2672
01:25:00,430 --> 01:25:02,290
You know, it gives you some time to learn.

2673
01:25:02,510 --> 01:25:03,890
It's nice to get carried sometimes, guys.

2674
01:25:04,030 --> 01:25:05,630
I'm tired of trying to carry.

2675
01:25:07,030 --> 01:25:09,530
I wanna be in the backpack, guys.

2676
01:25:10,190 --> 01:25:10,670
I...

2677
01:25:12,490 --> 01:25:15,730
Sometimes I just wanna sit in a backpack and like chill.

2678
01:25:15,730 --> 01:25:17,950
And just be like, yippee.

2679
01:25:18,890 --> 01:25:19,370
Is...

2680
01:25:19,370 --> 01:25:20,110
Is your...

2681
01:25:20,810 --> 01:25:22,130
Is your mouse...

2682
01:25:22,630 --> 01:25:24,330
Like sensitivity okay in this game?

2683
01:25:24,410 --> 01:25:24,730
Oh, yeah.

2684
01:25:24,870 --> 01:25:26,210
Maybe it's too fast or anything like that?

2685
01:25:26,210 --> 01:25:27,230
No, I converted it.

2686
01:25:27,650 --> 01:25:28,710
I converted it.

2687
01:25:29,250 --> 01:25:29,330
Okay.

2688
01:25:29,330 --> 01:25:29,650
I converted it.

2689
01:25:29,690 --> 01:25:30,170
Oh.

2690
01:25:31,010 --> 01:25:31,350
Nice.

2691
01:25:31,710 --> 01:25:32,270
I think for me it's...

2692
01:25:32,270 --> 01:25:33,410
I think for me it's just...

2693
01:25:33,410 --> 01:25:35,190
I need to remember not to move when I'm shooting.

2694
01:25:35,890 --> 01:25:36,810
Cause like...

2695
01:25:36,810 --> 01:25:38,410
I'm a movement shooter.

2696
01:25:40,170 --> 01:25:40,650
But...

2697
01:25:40,650 --> 01:25:41,350
Not even.

2698
01:25:41,530 --> 01:25:42,730
So there is movement shooting in this.

2699
01:25:42,870 --> 01:25:43,250
But it's...

2700
01:25:43,250 --> 01:25:44,390
It's counter scraping.

2701
01:25:45,030 --> 01:25:45,690
Counter scraping.

2702
01:25:45,690 --> 01:25:45,970
Counter scraping.

2703
01:25:46,250 --> 01:25:48,370
Heard of that phrase but I don't know what it actually means.

2704
01:25:49,270 --> 01:25:49,550
I...

2705
01:25:50,210 --> 01:25:51,290
I think it's like...

2706
01:25:51,290 --> 01:25:51,950
If you...

2707
01:25:51,950 --> 01:25:53,370
If you're say moving right.

2708
01:25:53,370 --> 01:25:54,250
And you shoot.

2709
01:25:54,390 --> 01:25:55,490
Then you need to step left.

2710
01:25:55,810 --> 01:25:56,390
To like...

2711
01:25:56,390 --> 01:25:56,830
Counter.

2712
01:25:57,470 --> 01:25:57,670
Oh.

2713
01:25:58,090 --> 01:25:58,570
Okay.

2714
01:25:58,830 --> 01:26:00,790
The movement of you plus the gun.

2715
01:26:00,910 --> 01:26:01,230
Oh my god.

2716
01:26:01,230 --> 01:26:01,830
I'm pretty sure.

2717
01:26:02,070 --> 01:26:02,250
Check.

2718
01:26:02,370 --> 01:26:03,130
Correct me if...

2719
01:26:03,130 --> 01:26:03,730
I'm wrong.

2720
01:26:04,810 --> 01:26:05,470
I don't...

2721
01:26:05,470 --> 01:26:06,510
I don't do it cause uh...

2722
01:26:06,510 --> 01:26:07,190
I never really learned.

2723
01:26:09,750 --> 01:26:10,510
Oh nice.

2724
01:26:11,390 --> 01:26:12,270
Did I kill that guy?

2725
01:26:13,330 --> 01:26:13,890
Oh yeah.

2726
01:26:13,950 --> 01:26:14,490
It was me.

2727
01:26:14,690 --> 01:26:15,830
Oh they said it's like apex.

2728
01:26:16,410 --> 01:26:17,030
It is.

2729
01:26:17,510 --> 01:26:18,710
Do you counter strafe an apex?

2730
01:26:19,170 --> 01:26:20,010
Oh I do.

2731
01:26:20,170 --> 01:26:21,050
But it's like instinct.

2732
01:26:21,310 --> 01:26:22,190
I don't really like...

2733
01:26:22,190 --> 01:26:23,230
Think of like...

2734
01:26:23,230 --> 01:26:23,710
Oh.

2735
01:26:24,010 --> 01:26:25,110
I don't think about it.

2736
01:26:25,190 --> 01:26:25,950
I just know like...

2737
01:26:25,950 --> 01:26:27,410
My shots actually hit.

2738
01:26:27,870 --> 01:26:29,150
When I do it.

2739
01:26:29,590 --> 01:26:29,690
Oh.

2740
01:26:30,330 --> 01:26:30,730
Um...

2741
01:26:31,130 --> 01:26:31,530
It...

2742
01:26:31,530 --> 01:26:32,270
As I say.

2743
01:26:32,270 --> 01:26:33,430
If you're moving to the right.

2744
01:26:33,550 --> 01:26:34,370
Then hold the left.

2745
01:26:34,530 --> 01:26:35,870
For like a second while you shoot.

2746
01:26:36,030 --> 01:26:36,210
I guess.

2747
01:26:36,470 --> 01:26:36,630
Okay.

2748
01:26:39,250 --> 01:26:39,690
I just...

2749
01:26:39,690 --> 01:26:40,550
That's if you're moving though.

2750
01:26:41,030 --> 01:26:42,470
A lot of my time when I'm playing.

2751
01:26:42,470 --> 01:26:44,190
I don't really think how I play.

2752
01:26:44,350 --> 01:26:45,430
It's more so like just...

2753
01:26:45,430 --> 01:26:46,970
Clearly like muscle memory for me.

2754
01:26:48,230 --> 01:26:48,550
Yeah.

2755
01:26:48,690 --> 01:26:49,290
Cause like...

2756
01:26:49,290 --> 01:26:49,490
Okay.

2757
01:26:49,950 --> 01:26:50,270
I...

2758
01:26:50,270 --> 01:26:51,070
Watch your smoke.

2759
01:26:55,150 --> 01:26:56,490
One day I'll be...

2760
01:26:56,490 --> 01:26:57,090
I need to push lower tons.

2761
01:26:57,610 --> 01:26:59,590
One day I'll be able to do that.

2762
01:27:01,850 --> 01:27:03,630
Actually I just learned the smoke today.

2763
01:27:03,770 --> 01:27:04,450
So I could teach you.

2764
01:27:05,730 --> 01:27:07,510
Did you just let other people smoke for you?

2765
01:27:09,110 --> 01:27:09,550
Uh...

2766
01:27:09,550 --> 01:27:09,750
Yeah.

2767
01:27:09,970 --> 01:27:11,570
I usually use my smoke um...

2768
01:27:11,570 --> 01:27:12,050
On long.

2769
01:27:12,450 --> 01:27:13,110
If I'm pushing long.

2770
01:27:13,370 --> 01:27:14,090
Because uh...

2771
01:27:14,090 --> 01:27:14,230
Yeah.

2772
01:27:14,310 --> 01:27:15,150
That one's much easier.

2773
01:27:16,370 --> 01:27:16,810
Alright.

2774
01:27:16,970 --> 01:27:17,710
I'm going cat.

2775
01:27:21,270 --> 01:27:22,450
They saw the bomb.

2776
01:27:23,350 --> 01:27:23,950
Wait where?

2777
01:27:25,430 --> 01:27:26,230
They saw...

2778
01:27:26,230 --> 01:27:27,350
They saw us going A.

2779
01:27:27,630 --> 01:27:28,390
So they're probably...

2780
01:27:31,470 --> 01:27:32,950
You guys will be fine right?

2781
01:27:34,270 --> 01:27:34,670
Yeah.

2782
01:27:34,970 --> 01:27:35,330
We're going...

2783
01:27:35,330 --> 01:27:35,990
We're still going A.

2784
01:27:37,050 --> 01:27:37,290
Yeah.

2785
01:27:37,430 --> 01:27:38,630
I'm going to plant...

2786
01:27:38,630 --> 01:27:39,390
Oh you have the bomb.

2787
01:27:39,570 --> 01:27:39,710
Okay.

2788
01:27:39,790 --> 01:27:40,630
I was going to say who has the bomb.

2789
01:27:41,390 --> 01:27:41,750
Oh.

2790
01:27:42,310 --> 01:27:43,250
So he's in CT.

2791
01:27:43,430 --> 01:27:43,990
One's in CT.

2792
01:27:47,110 --> 01:27:47,510
Um...

2793
01:27:47,510 --> 01:27:49,170
You could just watch cat if you would stand here.

2794
01:27:49,250 --> 01:27:49,550
Oh my god.

2795
01:27:49,550 --> 01:27:49,990
I hit him.

2796
01:27:51,090 --> 01:27:51,570
I...

2797
01:27:51,570 --> 01:27:52,310
Oh shit.

2798
01:27:52,450 --> 01:27:52,830
He jumped.

2799
01:27:52,830 --> 01:27:53,250
He's going to push ramp.

2800
01:27:54,730 --> 01:27:55,210
He...

2801
01:27:55,210 --> 01:27:57,130
I didn't expect him to jump.

2802
01:27:57,590 --> 01:27:58,510
We did it.

2803
01:27:59,370 --> 01:27:59,850
Oh.

2804
01:28:00,330 --> 01:28:00,710
Woo.

2805
01:28:01,870 --> 01:28:03,030
I get your deagle.

2806
01:28:03,370 --> 01:28:03,630
Nice.

2807
01:28:05,230 --> 01:28:07,270
I didn't expect him to also jump.

2808
01:28:08,510 --> 01:28:09,710
I was like...

2809
01:28:09,710 --> 01:28:10,570
I was like...

2810
01:28:10,570 --> 01:28:11,670
He's not going to do that.

2811
01:28:11,910 --> 01:28:12,630
There's no way.

2812
01:28:13,730 --> 01:28:14,050
Yeah.

2813
01:28:14,050 --> 01:28:16,410
I think with like the guns that you like...

2814
01:28:16,410 --> 01:28:17,410
Like the SMGs and stuff.

2815
01:28:17,610 --> 01:28:19,510
You can jump and shoot and kind of hit it.

2816
01:28:19,590 --> 01:28:20,390
Oh and shotguns.

2817
01:28:20,490 --> 01:28:20,730
Oh.

2818
01:28:20,890 --> 01:28:20,990
Oh.

2819
01:28:20,990 --> 01:28:21,050
And shotguns.

2820
01:28:21,050 --> 01:28:21,930
With like other guns.

2821
01:28:22,110 --> 01:28:22,190
Yeah.

2822
01:28:22,330 --> 01:28:22,910
You can't really...

2823
01:28:22,910 --> 01:28:23,050
Yeah.

2824
01:28:25,610 --> 01:28:26,050
Alright.

2825
01:28:28,710 --> 01:28:29,590
I shouldn't...

2826
01:28:29,590 --> 01:28:29,830
Oh wait.

2827
01:28:30,050 --> 01:28:31,210
I should like use my knife.

2828
01:28:32,530 --> 01:28:32,970
More.

2829
01:28:34,810 --> 01:28:36,050
I'm too paranoid.

2830
01:28:36,430 --> 01:28:36,970
Freeze for a second.

2831
01:28:37,770 --> 01:28:39,310
I'm so paranoid.

2832
01:28:43,620 --> 01:28:44,160
Alright.

2833
01:28:44,340 --> 01:28:45,300
I'm going to go through cat.

2834
01:28:45,620 --> 01:28:46,560
I'm just going to run it.

2835
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:49,900
Oh.

2836
01:28:50,220 --> 01:28:50,540
What?

2837
01:28:50,540 --> 01:28:50,740
What's that?

2838
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:54,140
Um.

2839
01:28:54,280 --> 01:28:55,760
There's somebody behind uh...

2840
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:56,180

2841
01:28:56,840 --> 01:28:57,140
Oh.

2842
01:28:59,140 --> 01:28:59,520
Nice.

2843
01:29:00,340 --> 01:29:00,780
Oh shit.

2844
01:29:01,260 --> 01:29:01,280
Haha.

2845
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:01,640
Haha.

2846
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:03,840
Don't worry.

2847
01:29:04,180 --> 01:29:05,300
I'm going to run and gun it.

2848
01:29:05,380 --> 01:29:06,140
I'm going to go on sight.

2849
01:29:07,260 --> 01:29:07,640
Haha.

2850
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:11,720
Oh nice.

2851
01:29:11,820 --> 01:29:11,920
Okay.

2852
01:29:12,020 --> 01:29:12,760
I'm going to plant for real.

2853
01:29:13,980 --> 01:29:14,360
Okay.

2854
01:29:14,380 --> 01:29:15,060
I'm looking at cat.

2855
01:29:15,860 --> 01:29:17,180
Oh, it's just the two of us.

2856
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:17,640
Oh.

2857
01:29:17,780 --> 01:29:18,460
No, it's three.

2858
01:29:18,780 --> 01:29:19,080
Three.

2859
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:20,220
Okay.

2860
01:29:20,700 --> 01:29:21,560
Where's the other two?

2861
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:23,920
Um.

2862
01:29:26,300 --> 01:29:27,520
One's in CT spawn.

2863
01:29:27,720 --> 01:29:28,280
Oh, one's long.

2864
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:28,960
Oh, okay.

2865
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:30,160
So nobody's here.

2866
01:29:30,340 --> 01:29:30,440
Dammit.

2867
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:32,340
No.

2868
01:29:32,780 --> 01:29:34,560
They're underneath and um...

2869
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:36,840
That's right.

2870
01:29:37,060 --> 01:29:38,960
Pushing up onto A site right now from long.

2871
01:29:39,700 --> 01:29:40,060
Oh.

2872
01:29:40,240 --> 01:29:40,380
Okay.

2873
01:29:40,420 --> 01:29:40,940
I should come back.

2874
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:41,200
Your teammate.

2875
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:41,980
You're going to have to rush.

2876
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:42,620
Oh shit.

2877
01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:44,180
They might try to defuse.

2878
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:45,460
Oh my god.

2879
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:46,380
I didn't...

2880
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:48,920
I think they're defusing right now.

2881
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:50,680
Oh no.

2882
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:51,360
Oh no.

2883
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:52,020
We're going to push him.

2884
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:52,440
We're going to push him.

2885
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:52,940
We're going to push him.

2886
01:29:52,940 --> 01:29:52,980
We're going to push him.

2887
01:29:52,980 --> 01:29:53,180
We're going to push him.

2888
01:29:53,180 --> 01:29:53,300
We're going to push him.

2889
01:29:53,480 --> 01:29:53,840
We're going to push him.

2890
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:54,060
We're going to push him.

2891
01:29:54,060 --> 01:29:54,600
We're going to push him.

2892
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:54,880
We're going to push him.

2893
01:29:55,180 --> 01:29:55,420
Uh oh.

2894
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,160
You almost had it.

2895
01:29:58,560 --> 01:29:58,660
No.

2896
01:30:02,860 --> 01:30:03,260
It's okay.

2897
01:30:03,400 --> 01:30:03,760
I got the killer.

2898
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:04,320
Nice try.

2899
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:04,720
Nice try.

2900
01:30:05,380 --> 01:30:05,620
Nice try.

2901
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:18,720
Nice try.

2902
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:20,920
I didn't think we'd done that.

2903
01:30:21,740 --> 01:30:24,220
I was gonna do a long walk behind.

2904
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:26,500
I'll be like, don't ever expect a long plank.

2905
01:30:30,070 --> 01:30:30,710
Alright.

2906
01:30:33,330 --> 01:30:35,370
I'm slowly walking up.

2907
01:30:36,970 --> 01:30:38,630
I don't think I can shoot past that.

2908
01:30:40,910 --> 01:30:41,550
Alright.

2909
01:30:41,810 --> 01:30:42,890
I believe in you.

2910
01:30:43,350 --> 01:30:45,050
You can... I'll use USB.

2911
01:30:45,490 --> 01:30:45,810
Okay.

2912
01:30:46,870 --> 01:30:47,810
Oh, never mind.

2913
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:54,320
Anybody going mid?

2914
01:30:56,020 --> 01:30:56,660
No?

2915
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:58,920
One's car.

2916
01:31:00,660 --> 01:31:01,120
Oh!

2917
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:02,480
I didn't...

2918
01:31:03,140 --> 01:31:04,140
I didn't look right.

2919
01:31:04,140 --> 01:31:05,100
He's waiting for you!

2920
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:05,780
I know!

2921
01:31:06,220 --> 01:31:06,860
That pussy!

2922
01:31:08,220 --> 01:31:08,980
It's okay.

2923
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:10,220
All he got was a P90.

2924
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:11,940
I didn't spend money.

2925
01:31:15,940 --> 01:31:16,800
Oh, shit.

2926
01:31:16,860 --> 01:31:17,520
That was a good flash.

2927
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:19,660
He cheated.

2928
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:20,220
I know.

2929
01:31:20,580 --> 01:31:21,280
He can't.

2930
01:31:22,140 --> 01:31:22,700
No.

2931
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:24,660
Fight me like a real play.

2932
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:27,320
Oh!

2933
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:28,360
What?

2934
01:31:28,460 --> 01:31:30,380
What the fuck ass shot was that?

2935
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:30,840
Huh?

2936
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:32,220
You saw that?

2937
01:31:32,340 --> 01:31:33,780
He just like, randomly flicked.

2938
01:31:35,460 --> 01:31:35,880
Oh.

2939
01:31:36,180 --> 01:31:37,160
Maybe he is cheating then.

2940
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:39,380
That was such a weird... Yeah, that...

2941
01:31:39,380 --> 01:31:40,900
...prefile was fucking weird.

2942
01:31:43,180 --> 01:31:43,620
Okay.

2943
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:43,740
Okay.

2944
01:31:43,780 --> 01:31:44,200
Yeah, that...

2945
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:44,920
That's what...

2946
01:31:44,920 --> 01:31:47,420
I think with this game, if you don't have...

2947
01:31:47,420 --> 01:31:48,260
Prime?

2948
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:51,380
Chat correct me if I'm wrong, but you need Prime to...

2949
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:52,640
...not...

2950
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:54,220
...get cued with cheaters as often.

2951
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:54,720
Oh.

2952
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:55,700
Which...

2953
01:31:55,700 --> 01:31:57,220
Yeah, because I think...

2954
01:31:57,740 --> 01:31:58,160
I don't know.

2955
01:31:58,240 --> 01:31:58,980
Is that a thing anymore?

2956
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:00,080
I have no idea.

2957
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:00,900
It used to be like...

2958
01:32:01,460 --> 01:32:03,740
Counter-Strike was free, and then...

2959
01:32:03,740 --> 01:32:05,020
...you could, uh...

2960
01:32:05,020 --> 01:32:06,740
...you could buy Prime.

2961
01:32:07,540 --> 01:32:08,500
Wait, what?

2962
01:32:08,900 --> 01:32:09,940
Oh, it's like, pay to win.

2963
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:12,900
No, no, not really.

2964
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:14,920
It's like, pay for a...

2965
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:17,120
What is it called?

2966
01:32:17,220 --> 01:32:18,660
The Valorant has like, the...

2967
01:32:18,660 --> 01:32:19,560
...cheat thing?

2968
01:32:20,900 --> 01:32:21,840
It's like...

2969
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:23,040
...cheat guard, riot guard.

2970
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:23,900
Riot guard?

2971
01:32:24,140 --> 01:32:24,340
Yeah.

2972
01:32:25,060 --> 01:32:25,880
Don't worry, buddy.

2973
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,020
I'm gonna use you to play.

2974
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:30,300
Man, alright, this guy's good.

2975
01:32:30,540 --> 01:32:31,360
I'm following him.

2976
01:32:34,980 --> 01:32:36,540
Oh my god, he killed everybody.

2977
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:38,900
Last guy is on A.

2978
01:32:39,620 --> 01:32:40,380
He's cat.

2979
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:41,380
Oh, yeah.

2980
01:32:42,780 --> 01:32:43,580
He's still...

2981
01:32:43,580 --> 01:32:44,460
He's just sitting there.

2982
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:47,520
I'll just wait until my team's here...

2983
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:48,340
...and then use them as bait.

2984
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:48,800
Yay!

2985
01:32:51,680 --> 01:32:52,140
Yay!

2986
01:32:55,220 --> 01:32:55,680
Alright.

2987
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:56,700
We should do a...

2988
01:32:56,700 --> 01:32:57,600
...a B rush.

2989
01:32:57,860 --> 01:32:58,220
A B rush?

2990
01:32:58,320 --> 01:32:59,240
Alright, I'm right behind you.

2991
01:33:00,640 --> 01:33:01,980
I'm there, all the way.

2992
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:03,180
Okay.

2993
01:33:03,180 --> 01:33:03,200
Okay.

2994
01:33:03,860 --> 01:33:04,440
Wait, wait, wait.

2995
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:06,480
I have an A spawn, so...

2996
01:33:07,420 --> 01:33:09,900
I'll make them think that we're going A, but then you guys go B.

2997
01:33:10,100 --> 01:33:10,380
Okay.

2998
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:11,960
I'll wait for you.

2999
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:13,360
Everyone's going A.

3000
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:14,500
I don't think our teammates are going A.

3001
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:15,480
I don't think our teammates are going A.

3002
01:33:15,480 --> 01:33:15,940
I can't.

3003
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:18,820
Okay, but when we both...

3004
01:33:18,820 --> 01:33:20,440
We baited them and baited our teammates.

3005
01:33:20,760 --> 01:33:21,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3006
01:33:21,260 --> 01:33:23,280
But when we start going B...

3007
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:24,340
We're gonna like...

3008
01:33:26,840 --> 01:33:28,060
Don't worry, I believe in us.

3009
01:33:28,060 --> 01:33:29,380
We'll walk, we'll be sneaky.

3010
01:33:31,320 --> 01:33:32,840
Alright, I'm right behind you.

3011
01:33:36,180 --> 01:33:38,020
I'm gonna wait for the smoke and tunnels.

3012
01:33:38,380 --> 01:33:39,020
And then we'll push.

3013
01:33:39,140 --> 01:33:40,060
So if you want to watch...

3014
01:33:40,060 --> 01:33:41,740
Well, I don't think in lower tunnels anybody's gonna push.

3015
01:33:42,020 --> 01:33:43,240
I'll wait, just in case.

3016
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:43,940
I'll look.

3017
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:46,520
There's one guy close here.

3018
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:49,920
I'm looking at lower tunnels.

3019
01:33:50,120 --> 01:33:50,500
I got...

3020
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:51,900
I got...

3021
01:33:52,580 --> 01:33:52,980
Oh!

3022
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:54,420
Don't worry, he doesn't know I'm here.

3023
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:57,540
They don't know, they don't know.

3024
01:33:57,540 --> 01:33:58,080
You don't know.

3025
01:33:58,300 --> 01:33:59,860
You have the bomb, so you should go with our teammates.

3026
01:33:59,900 --> 01:34:01,180
Oh wait, I have the bomb?

3027
01:34:01,460 --> 01:34:02,200
Oh shit!

3028
01:34:02,980 --> 01:34:03,200
Yeah.

3029
01:34:03,580 --> 01:34:04,160
I didn't know!

3030
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:05,600
I thought I threw it away!

3031
01:34:06,220 --> 01:34:07,380
Clearly I didn't!

3032
01:34:07,540 --> 01:34:08,920
There's one guy, Cat, I think.

3033
01:34:09,300 --> 01:34:09,980
I thought I heard one.

3034
01:34:11,980 --> 01:34:13,860
You scared the shit out of me.

3035
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:18,460
Oh my god, I'm down.

3036
01:34:22,840 --> 01:34:23,720
Okay, look.

3037
01:34:23,980 --> 01:34:24,420
I...

3038
01:34:24,420 --> 01:34:25,100
I...

3039
01:34:25,100 --> 01:34:27,320
I did throw the bomb away.

3040
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:30,160
I remember pressing 5 and G.

3041
01:34:33,860 --> 01:34:34,440
Yeah.

3042
01:34:34,900 --> 01:34:36,540
Maybe somebody else threw it to you.

3043
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:37,760
Yeah, I think some...

3044
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:40,240
I think someone threw it back to me.

3045
01:34:40,260 --> 01:34:40,980
Are these guys cleaning up?

3046
01:34:41,260 --> 01:34:41,840
It's okay.

3047
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:42,940
We're gonna get carried.

3048
01:34:42,940 --> 01:34:43,720
I believe.

3049
01:34:46,220 --> 01:34:47,320
Okay, I...

3050
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:48,440
I stopped believing.

3051
01:34:48,440 --> 01:34:49,000
I...

3052
01:34:51,720 --> 01:34:53,520
No, we're still really early in the round.

3053
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:54,140
Yeah, that's true.

3054
01:34:54,240 --> 01:34:54,640
That's true.

3055
01:34:54,900 --> 01:34:55,200
I won.

3056
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:57,320
Okay, I won't...

3057
01:34:57,320 --> 01:34:57,460
Alright.

3058
01:34:57,740 --> 01:34:58,460
Let's rush B.

3059
01:34:58,740 --> 01:34:59,440
Just us two.

3060
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:01,320
I don't have the bomb, so I can't throw.

3061
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:03,560
Okay.

3062
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:03,920
Okay.

3063
01:35:04,120 --> 01:35:04,960
Oh yeah, I wanted to ask you.

3064
01:35:05,080 --> 01:35:07,000
Your birthday's coming up soon.

3065
01:35:07,220 --> 01:35:07,440
Yeah!

3066
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:08,520
Isn't it?

3067
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:09,620
Is it?

3068
01:35:09,820 --> 01:35:11,420
Oh, I think it's because I shot him.

3069
01:35:13,480 --> 01:35:14,200
I got...

3070
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:15,600
I got shanked.

3071
01:35:16,020 --> 01:35:16,200
I...

3072
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:17,060
He stabbed you!

3073
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:17,560
I...

3074
01:35:18,020 --> 01:35:19,400
I did shoot him.

3075
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:20,620
I did shoot him.

3076
01:35:20,760 --> 01:35:21,960
It's like...

3077
01:35:22,480 --> 01:35:26,960
Alright, so I have like 39 HP now, so...

3078
01:35:27,400 --> 01:35:27,880
Wait, what?

3079
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:30,180
The fuck where did he get shot by?

3080
01:35:31,860 --> 01:35:33,460
There's a guy that pushed there in the doors.

3081
01:35:33,460 --> 01:35:33,880
In the doors?

3082
01:35:34,180 --> 01:35:34,240
Oh.

3083
01:35:34,240 --> 01:35:34,980
He's waiting for us.

3084
01:35:35,500 --> 01:35:35,860
Yeah.

3085
01:35:36,700 --> 01:35:37,420
Actually, he...

3086
01:35:37,940 --> 01:35:38,300
Wait?

3087
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:39,400
He might have gone back.

3088
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:40,140
Oh, okay.

3089
01:35:40,900 --> 01:35:41,980
Um, I'm gonna push...

3090
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:44,500
I'm gonna flash him long, so this is like...

3091
01:35:44,500 --> 01:35:45,360
Long flash.

3092
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:47,360
Okay.

3093
01:35:48,980 --> 01:35:49,340
Um...

3094
01:35:49,340 --> 01:35:50,620
I'm gonna walk up and die.

3095
01:35:50,820 --> 01:35:51,340
Do you want a gun?

3096
01:35:51,460 --> 01:35:51,960
Do you have a gun?

3097
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:52,720
Yeah, I have a gun.

3098
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:54,460
I have an AK, but I'm still...

3099
01:35:54,860 --> 01:35:56,240
I think I'm gonna die here.

3100
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:00,460
Now you'll get him.

3101
01:36:01,260 --> 01:36:02,080
Where is he?

3102
01:36:04,740 --> 01:36:05,180
Which...

3103
01:36:05,660 --> 01:36:06,900
I almost yelled at chat.

3104
01:36:07,140 --> 01:36:07,360
Chat?

3105
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:08,560
Why did you tell me?

3106
01:36:08,940 --> 01:36:10,160
There's one guy mid...

3107
01:36:10,160 --> 01:36:11,240
And then I...

3108
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:13,060
Think there might be one guy on A.

3109
01:36:14,060 --> 01:36:14,800
Where is he?

3110
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:16,960
Oh, there he is.

3111
01:36:17,460 --> 01:36:17,840
Guys!

3112
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:23,020
He was literally standing up there, crouched, looking down.

3113
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:24,760
I was like, what are you doing down there?

3114
01:36:24,760 --> 01:36:25,580
Right here.

3115
01:36:28,740 --> 01:36:29,140
Nice.

3116
01:36:29,180 --> 01:36:31,180
You could've snuck up behind him and stabbed him.

3117
01:36:31,180 --> 01:36:31,800
That's so true.

3118
01:36:31,980 --> 01:36:32,740
I could've done that.

3119
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:33,700
It was too far.

3120
01:36:33,940 --> 01:36:35,340
It was such a long walk.

3121
01:36:36,360 --> 01:36:37,160
We spawned.

3122
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:37,880
Yeah.

3123
01:36:39,220 --> 01:36:40,520
We spawned right next to each other.

3124
01:36:40,780 --> 01:36:41,040
Yay!

3125
01:36:41,740 --> 01:36:42,900
Alright, now we rush B.

3126
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:44,200
Oh, here, look.

3127
01:36:44,460 --> 01:36:44,660
Yeah?

3128
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:46,000
Oh, look, look.

3129
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:46,720
Jump on my head.

3130
01:36:46,980 --> 01:36:48,200
Oh my god, we're gonna do a boost.

3131
01:36:49,420 --> 01:36:51,060
And then you take me over to this box.

3132
01:36:52,740 --> 01:36:53,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3133
01:36:53,980 --> 01:36:55,200
Oh, okay.

3134
01:36:56,100 --> 01:36:57,300
I wanna be tall.

3135
01:36:58,560 --> 01:36:59,680
Oh, no, it doesn't work.

3136
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:01,020
Oh, I don't think you can get up there, actually.

3137
01:37:01,340 --> 01:37:02,360
Oh, oh, our team's dead.

3138
01:37:04,380 --> 01:37:05,840
Nah, it's just one guy.

3139
01:37:06,300 --> 01:37:06,880
Yeah, that...

3140
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:08,040
No, two guys, isn't it?

3141
01:37:08,660 --> 01:37:09,940
That guy didn't matter, anyway.

3142
01:37:10,220 --> 01:37:11,700
Uh, okay, now it's two guys.

3143
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:13,120
He didn't matter.

3144
01:37:13,400 --> 01:37:15,560
I'm gonna push this, even though he just died.

3145
01:37:16,360 --> 01:37:16,500
Here.

3146
01:37:16,840 --> 01:37:17,960
I'll push the other way.

3147
01:37:23,140 --> 01:37:24,580
Sure, I'm not gonna get op'd, right?

3148
01:37:31,620 --> 01:37:32,140
Okay.

3149
01:37:32,140 --> 01:37:33,180
Oh, I'm in cat.

3150
01:37:34,500 --> 01:37:35,020
Oh!

3151
01:37:35,640 --> 01:37:36,900
Okay, I was in cat.

3152
01:37:40,580 --> 01:37:42,560
Alright, I guess it's up to me and orange.

3153
01:37:42,900 --> 01:37:44,020
I believe in you.

3154
01:37:47,240 --> 01:37:48,440
You got this.

3155
01:37:49,140 --> 01:37:49,560
Oh!

3156
01:37:50,460 --> 01:37:51,780
Okay, that was a good shot by him.

3157
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:53,780
Oh, wait.

3158
01:37:54,100 --> 01:37:55,860
Oh, oh, that's his second kill.

3159
01:37:56,080 --> 01:37:56,760
He's got this.

3160
01:37:58,260 --> 01:37:58,820
Oh.

3161
01:37:59,520 --> 01:37:59,900
Ah!

3162
01:38:00,780 --> 01:38:01,260
It's okay.

3163
01:38:01,420 --> 01:38:02,400
I believe in the AWPer.

3164
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:03,100
It's a 1v2.

3165
01:38:04,660 --> 01:38:05,220
Yeah.

3166
01:38:05,560 --> 01:38:05,940
Holy shit.

3167
01:38:07,100 --> 01:38:08,460
That's an interesting shot.

3168
01:38:12,500 --> 01:38:12,780
Oh!

3169
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:14,200
It's alright.

3170
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:14,820
It's...

3171
01:38:14,820 --> 01:38:16,100
You know, it's okay.

3172
01:38:16,420 --> 01:38:17,420
He was AWPing.

3173
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:18,560
He was AWPing.

3174
01:38:19,660 --> 01:38:20,540
Oh, okay.

3175
01:38:20,660 --> 01:38:20,860
Yeah.

3176
01:38:20,860 --> 01:38:23,720
Well, the enemy team has an AWP now, so...

3177
01:38:23,720 --> 01:38:24,080
Oh.

3178
01:38:24,080 --> 01:38:24,580
Oh.

3179
01:38:27,320 --> 01:38:28,820
I'm not going mid.

3180
01:38:30,920 --> 01:38:32,300
Yeah, don't peek yet.

3181
01:38:32,440 --> 01:38:32,760
Don't peek yet.

3182
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:33,180
Or long.

3183
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:34,580
I guess we could try going...

3184
01:38:34,580 --> 01:38:35,400
B.

3185
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:37,180
Oh, I got a bye.

3186
01:38:37,980 --> 01:38:39,220
Oh, you forgot to battle.

3187
01:38:40,660 --> 01:38:41,360
Wait, who...

3188
01:38:41,360 --> 01:38:42,720
No, somebody gave me a gun.

3189
01:38:42,760 --> 01:38:43,380
Oh, nice.

3190
01:38:43,640 --> 01:38:44,480
I'll follow you.

3191
01:38:46,640 --> 01:38:47,080
Okay.

3192
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:54,820
Alright, I got the bomb.

3193
01:38:56,720 --> 01:38:58,240
Okay, we're gonna try to...

3194
01:38:58,240 --> 01:38:58,260
Oh.

3195
01:38:58,620 --> 01:38:58,780
Oh.

3196
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:00,240
They're AWPing on B.

3197
01:39:01,040 --> 01:39:01,520
Um...

3198
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:02,040
Um...

3199
01:39:02,040 --> 01:39:02,480
Do we...

3200
01:39:02,480 --> 01:39:03,220
I'm rotating.

3201
01:39:06,460 --> 01:39:07,620
I'm gonna rotate.

3202
01:39:09,180 --> 01:39:10,140
Wait, it's just us two.

3203
01:39:11,780 --> 01:39:12,260
Uh...

3204
01:39:14,020 --> 01:39:15,640
Okay, let's just die, I guess.

3205
01:39:18,820 --> 01:39:19,580
Where was he?

3206
01:39:20,240 --> 01:39:20,340
Where was he?

3207
01:39:20,340 --> 01:39:21,300
Oh, we had somebody disconnect.

3208
01:39:21,880 --> 01:39:22,440
Oh, he's us.

3209
01:39:22,600 --> 01:39:22,840
You're right.

3210
01:39:24,660 --> 01:39:25,140
I try.

3211
01:39:25,300 --> 01:39:25,880
That was...

3212
01:39:25,880 --> 01:39:26,940
That was the left.

3213
01:39:30,100 --> 01:39:30,460
Yeah.

3214
01:39:30,760 --> 01:39:31,700
Well, there were two guys.

3215
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:32,440
There were two guys there.

3216
01:39:32,600 --> 01:39:33,040
Yeah, that's true.

3217
01:39:33,120 --> 01:39:33,400
That's true.

3218
01:39:33,480 --> 01:39:34,080
There were two guys.

3219
01:39:36,060 --> 01:39:37,080
It wasn't our fault.

3220
01:39:37,680 --> 01:39:38,620
Two was more than one.

3221
01:39:38,620 --> 01:39:39,580
I'm gonna do full save.

3222
01:39:40,220 --> 01:39:40,620
Oh.

3223
01:39:40,980 --> 01:39:41,960
I bought a gun.

3224
01:39:42,280 --> 01:39:42,500
Yeah.

3225
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:42,940
Oh.

3226
01:39:43,240 --> 01:39:44,900
Yeah, somebody on our team left.

3227
01:39:45,080 --> 01:39:45,840
But I don't know.

3228
01:39:46,580 --> 01:39:47,220
Do we not get it?

3229
01:39:47,220 --> 01:39:48,100
I guess they're gone, gone.

3230
01:39:48,440 --> 01:39:48,760
So they can't...

3231
01:39:48,760 --> 01:39:49,660
I guess they're mad.

3232
01:39:49,960 --> 01:39:50,300
Come back.

3233
01:39:50,980 --> 01:39:51,360
Wait, no.

3234
01:39:51,480 --> 01:39:51,980
Aren't they back?

3235
01:39:52,060 --> 01:39:52,500
Oh, they're...

3236
01:39:52,500 --> 01:39:52,960
They're not.

3237
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:55,280
Wait, that guy was our second best player.

3238
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:55,360
Okay.

3239
01:39:55,500 --> 01:39:55,940
No.

3240
01:39:56,360 --> 01:39:57,380
I'm not sure.

3241
01:40:02,160 --> 01:40:03,220
Yeah, I believe.

3242
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:04,180
Alright.

3243
01:40:04,300 --> 01:40:05,200
We got it.

3244
01:40:05,340 --> 01:40:06,080
We got this.

3245
01:40:06,340 --> 01:40:07,280
We can definitely...

3246
01:40:09,380 --> 01:40:10,520
Wait, who has the bomb?

3247
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:12,020
Door and window.

3248
01:40:12,820 --> 01:40:12,900
Oh.

3249
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:16,440
And surrender.

3250
01:40:21,080 --> 01:40:22,480
Wait, but we can't...

3251
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:22,520
What'd you say?

3252
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:22,940
Nothing.

3253
01:40:26,380 --> 01:40:26,780
Oh.

3254
01:40:28,180 --> 01:40:29,920
This happens a lot with games.

3255
01:40:30,120 --> 01:40:30,940
Like somebody will disconnect.

3256
01:40:31,260 --> 01:40:33,720
And then you're just stuck the whole time without...

3257
01:40:33,720 --> 01:40:34,760
Oh, cause it's just a...

3258
01:40:34,760 --> 01:40:35,600
An extra person.

3259
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:37,260
I'm surprised they...

3260
01:40:37,260 --> 01:40:39,340
In the past they would put in a bot.

3261
01:40:39,540 --> 01:40:40,440
But I guess like people just...

3262
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:42,000
Uh...

3263
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:42,860
Abuse the...

3264
01:40:42,860 --> 01:40:43,980
Just farm the bot.

3265
01:40:44,220 --> 01:40:44,320
Right?

3266
01:40:46,160 --> 01:40:46,960
I'm not sure.

3267
01:40:47,140 --> 01:40:47,840
Yeah, they used to...

3268
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:49,120
There used to be a bot.

3269
01:40:49,260 --> 01:40:50,320
And you could like control it.

3270
01:40:50,460 --> 01:40:51,080
Yeah, yeah.

3271
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:52,020
What happened to that guy?

3272
01:40:52,020 --> 01:40:52,820
I guess they just got rid of it.

3273
01:40:52,900 --> 01:40:53,500
They're like, no.

3274
01:40:53,500 --> 01:40:53,700
I don't know.

3275
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:55,260
And what happened to him?

3276
01:40:55,540 --> 01:40:55,560
I don't know.

3277
01:40:55,640 --> 01:40:56,280
Did he retire?

3278
01:40:59,180 --> 01:41:00,240
Did he graduate?

3279
01:41:00,760 --> 01:41:01,580
Yeah, the bot retired.

3280
01:41:01,900 --> 01:41:03,240
The bot graduated.

3281
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:04,500
Oh my god.

3282
01:41:04,620 --> 01:41:06,380
We missed this graduation stream.

3283
01:41:06,640 --> 01:41:07,140
So sad.

3284
01:41:15,500 --> 01:41:16,400
Oh my god.

3285
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:16,640
Oh my god.

3286
01:41:16,640 --> 01:41:23,320
Oh my god.

3287
01:41:25,130 --> 01:41:25,610
My Oshi.

3288
01:41:26,130 --> 01:41:26,730
Graduated.

3289
01:41:27,370 --> 01:41:28,310
In CS.

3290
01:41:42,810 --> 01:41:43,410
Oh.

3291
01:41:43,590 --> 01:41:44,310
He's right there.

3292
01:41:44,570 --> 01:41:45,050
I see him.

3293
01:41:45,950 --> 01:41:46,590
Is that goose?

3294
01:41:46,590 --> 01:41:47,750
Oh my god.

3295
01:41:47,750 --> 01:41:48,010
Oh my god.

3296
01:41:48,010 --> 01:41:48,050
No.

3297
01:41:49,950 --> 01:41:50,790
Where am I?

3298
01:41:51,850 --> 01:41:52,850
If you don't have...

3299
01:41:52,850 --> 01:41:53,330
Oh.

3300
01:41:53,530 --> 01:41:54,210
He's close.

3301
01:41:54,210 --> 01:41:54,850
He's close.

3302
01:41:55,230 --> 01:41:55,710
Oh my god.

3303
01:41:55,730 --> 01:41:56,430
He flashed.

3304
01:42:00,150 --> 01:42:01,030
Where's the bomb?

3305
01:42:01,350 --> 01:42:02,450
Oh, I have bomb.

3306
01:42:02,450 --> 01:42:02,790
I...

3307
01:42:03,330 --> 01:42:03,850
Oh.

3308
01:42:05,610 --> 01:42:06,130
Oh.

3309
01:42:06,130 --> 01:42:06,950
They're both there.

3310
01:42:06,950 --> 01:42:07,470
Oh no.

3311
01:42:07,650 --> 01:42:08,550
The last two guys.

3312
01:42:08,890 --> 01:42:08,950
Yeah.

3313
01:42:11,270 --> 01:42:13,370
I didn't realize I had bomb.

3314
01:42:17,330 --> 01:42:20,350
I think I had it and then you stepped over and picked it up.

3315
01:42:20,350 --> 01:42:20,690
Oh.

3316
01:42:21,590 --> 01:42:23,190
After I died and dropped it.

3317
01:42:23,810 --> 01:42:24,330
Yeah.

3318
01:42:24,330 --> 01:42:24,910
That makes sense.

3319
01:42:25,070 --> 01:42:25,830
I was like, what the fuck?

3320
01:42:25,850 --> 01:42:27,210
Why do I have it?

3321
01:42:28,190 --> 01:42:31,450
Because I always check if I have bomb before I go anywhere.

3322
01:42:32,430 --> 01:42:32,850
Orange.

3323
01:42:33,010 --> 01:42:33,190
No.

3324
01:42:33,470 --> 01:42:35,250
Now you're gonna give him another op.

3325
01:42:37,150 --> 01:42:38,010
Oh no.

3326
01:42:38,390 --> 01:42:39,590
There's so many ops.

3327
01:42:39,950 --> 01:42:40,430
We have a lot of money.

3328
01:42:40,690 --> 01:42:41,210
That's true.

3329
01:42:41,390 --> 01:42:41,670
That's true.

3330
01:42:41,910 --> 01:42:43,550
Oh, I can buy an op.

3331
01:42:44,230 --> 01:42:44,710
Let's...

3332
01:42:44,710 --> 01:42:45,510
That's right.

3333
01:42:45,530 --> 01:42:46,590
It's my turn.

3334
01:42:48,330 --> 01:42:49,690
Are you gonna peak suicide?

3335
01:42:50,070 --> 01:42:50,390
Yes.

3336
01:42:51,710 --> 01:42:52,350
We're having...

3337
01:42:52,350 --> 01:42:53,650
We're gonna have an op 1v1.

3338
01:42:53,870 --> 01:42:53,890
Okay, I'm gonna flash it first.

3339
01:42:56,590 --> 01:42:57,970
We'll have an op 1v1.

3340
01:42:58,270 --> 01:42:58,430
Hopefully I didn't flash it.

3341
01:42:58,970 --> 01:43:00,570
I think I might die first, though.

3342
01:43:03,670 --> 01:43:03,990
Oh.

3343
01:43:03,990 --> 01:43:05,350
No, we...

3344
01:43:05,890 --> 01:43:06,790
They pushed up.

3345
01:43:07,010 --> 01:43:07,170
Okay.

3346
01:43:07,170 --> 01:43:08,350
Yeah, I was gonna say, what the fuck?

3347
01:43:09,290 --> 01:43:10,470
I was not expecting that.

3348
01:43:11,990 --> 01:43:12,310
You...

3349
01:43:12,310 --> 01:43:13,330
You got the guy who pushed up?

3350
01:43:13,330 --> 01:43:13,570
Yeah, yeah.

3351
01:43:13,710 --> 01:43:14,310
There's no, no, no, no.

3352
01:43:14,430 --> 01:43:15,010
Not the guy mid.

3353
01:43:15,110 --> 01:43:15,650
Not the guy mid.

3354
01:43:16,870 --> 01:43:17,190
Yeah.

3355
01:43:18,230 --> 01:43:18,550
Oh.

3356
01:43:19,690 --> 01:43:20,150
Nice.

3357
01:43:20,450 --> 01:43:21,270
Okay, they didn't.

3358
01:43:21,390 --> 01:43:21,650
Okay.

3359
01:43:22,050 --> 01:43:23,490
Okay, now we got both of them.

3360
01:43:25,110 --> 01:43:26,810
I feel like we should probably go...

3361
01:43:26,810 --> 01:43:27,710
I'm gonna go B.

3362
01:43:28,790 --> 01:43:29,150
Okay.

3363
01:43:30,070 --> 01:43:30,970
I'll still look at mid.

3364
01:43:32,930 --> 01:43:33,450
Okay.

3365
01:43:35,870 --> 01:43:37,570
Making sure nobody cross.

3366
01:43:41,730 --> 01:43:42,630
Nobody's crossing.

3367
01:43:42,830 --> 01:43:44,410
I'm gonna get stabbed in the back, aren't I?

3368
01:43:44,410 --> 01:43:44,490
Okay.

3369
01:43:46,050 --> 01:43:46,990
Wait, where was he?

3370
01:43:47,090 --> 01:43:47,230
No!

3371
01:43:47,230 --> 01:43:48,110
Shoot, he had a P90.

3372
01:43:48,330 --> 01:43:48,510
Fuck.

3373
01:43:48,870 --> 01:43:49,350
Where was he?

3374
01:43:49,630 --> 01:43:50,350
Um, lower ten...

3375
01:43:50,350 --> 01:43:51,010
Or, upper tens.

3376
01:43:52,110 --> 01:43:52,470
Where's that?

3377
01:43:52,470 --> 01:43:53,670
The last guy's in the tunnels.

3378
01:43:53,690 --> 01:43:54,550
Like, to the left.

3379
01:43:55,130 --> 01:43:56,670
Um, it's where your teammate is right now.

3380
01:43:59,450 --> 01:43:59,790
Okay.

3381
01:44:01,450 --> 01:44:02,930
I dropped my AWP for this.

3382
01:44:05,210 --> 01:44:05,910
Oh, yay!

3383
01:44:06,110 --> 01:44:06,510
Oh, you got it!

3384
01:44:06,890 --> 01:44:06,990
Yay!

3385
01:44:07,230 --> 01:44:07,910
We did it!

3386
01:44:09,950 --> 01:44:10,370
Yay!

3387
01:44:10,370 --> 01:44:10,610
Yay!

3388
01:44:10,610 --> 01:44:10,790
Yay!

3389
01:44:12,830 --> 01:44:13,310
Alright.

3390
01:44:14,670 --> 01:44:15,750
Back to the AWP.

3391
01:44:17,290 --> 01:44:19,230
This is our last round before we switch.

3392
01:44:20,450 --> 01:44:21,330
Oh my god.

3393
01:44:21,510 --> 01:44:24,110
I think there's a guy that's carrying us, but I'm not sure yet.

3394
01:44:27,150 --> 01:44:27,970
I think.

3395
01:44:29,230 --> 01:44:31,170
Wait, I think you're carrying yourself.

3396
01:44:31,590 --> 01:44:32,070
Let's go!

3397
01:44:34,290 --> 01:44:36,070
One of us will hit the shot.

3398
01:44:38,590 --> 01:44:39,490
Oh, shit.

3399
01:44:39,950 --> 01:44:41,670
Okay, that's way too many AWPs.

3400
01:44:48,720 --> 01:44:49,440
Alright, don't worry.

3401
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:50,260
I'm right behind your AWP.

3402
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:53,580
Where is he?

3403
01:44:53,900 --> 01:44:54,400
Oh, okay.

3404
01:44:54,660 --> 01:44:55,540
Let me get the bomb then.

3405
01:44:55,740 --> 01:44:55,940
Hold on.

3406
01:44:56,480 --> 01:44:56,800
Um...

3407
01:44:56,800 --> 01:44:59,660
I think there is one there, but he probably pushed up back towards site.

3408
01:44:59,820 --> 01:45:00,560
Cause he smoked off.

3409
01:45:00,740 --> 01:45:01,160
Oh, okay.

3410
01:45:04,540 --> 01:45:05,780
He killed our other AWPer.

3411
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:07,180
Um, Pit is a good place to AWP.

3412
01:45:07,860 --> 01:45:08,360
Where's Pit?

3413
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:08,800
Oh no.

3414
01:45:10,500 --> 01:45:12,700
So, you wanna come over here and then try to jump in.

3415
01:45:15,340 --> 01:45:16,160
Alright, I'm...

3416
01:45:16,160 --> 01:45:16,580
There's one on site.

3417
01:45:17,220 --> 01:45:17,960
Oh, I see him.

3418
01:45:18,380 --> 01:45:19,120
Wait, oh my...

3419
01:45:19,120 --> 01:45:19,600
Okay.

3420
01:45:21,180 --> 01:45:22,280
You got him, nice.

3421
01:45:22,340 --> 01:45:22,840
I did it.

3422
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:24,460
Oh, there's another one there.

3423
01:45:24,580 --> 01:45:25,020
It's an AWPer.

3424
01:45:25,580 --> 01:45:26,360
Where, where, where, where, where?

3425
01:45:26,540 --> 01:45:26,680
Up top?

3426
01:45:26,680 --> 01:45:27,800
They're gonna be pushing up behind you.

3427
01:45:28,640 --> 01:45:29,020
Up top?

3428
01:45:29,260 --> 01:45:29,280
Okay.

3429
01:45:29,280 --> 01:45:30,000
Yeah, he's on site.

3430
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:32,220
Oh no!

3431
01:45:32,360 --> 01:45:32,980
He flashed me!

3432
01:45:33,720 --> 01:45:34,260
My weakness!

3433
01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:35,360
No!

3434
01:45:35,800 --> 01:45:36,660
Oh, I got him though!

3435
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:37,460
I got him!

3436
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:39,620
It's okay!

3437
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:40,700
I got him!

3438
01:45:42,600 --> 01:45:43,800
I took one...

3439
01:45:44,040 --> 01:45:45,900
Yeah, I took one down with me.

3440
01:45:49,420 --> 01:45:50,020
That's right.

3441
01:45:50,040 --> 01:45:51,800
Are you gonna get skins now that you've played?

3442
01:45:51,800 --> 01:45:53,180
Oh no, I...

3443
01:45:53,180 --> 01:45:53,740
Now that you're good at this game.

3444
01:45:53,740 --> 01:45:54,860
I never buy skins.

3445
01:45:56,200 --> 01:45:58,120
I had a really bad, like...

3446
01:45:58,120 --> 01:45:59,120
Wait, you could gamble.

3447
01:45:59,660 --> 01:46:03,280
Oh, and it's legal in Canada, too.

3448
01:46:06,500 --> 01:46:09,380
You know, like, people, like, move to Canada just to gamble.

3449
01:46:10,640 --> 01:46:11,020
What?

3450
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:11,460
Really?

3451
01:46:11,460 --> 01:46:12,520
Yeah, you didn't know that?

3452
01:46:12,620 --> 01:46:13,300
No, it's true.

3453
01:46:13,440 --> 01:46:14,220
No, I didn't know that.

3454
01:46:14,300 --> 01:46:15,240
Yeah, legally.

3455
01:46:15,580 --> 01:46:17,120
So you see, like, gambling streams?

3456
01:46:17,460 --> 01:46:19,020
Like, that's because they're Canadian.

3457
01:46:19,380 --> 01:46:19,420
They're B.

3458
01:46:19,780 --> 01:46:20,920
Okay, I'm coming over.

3459
01:46:21,280 --> 01:46:21,880
Oh, they're coming!

3460
01:46:21,980 --> 01:46:22,260
There's another guy!

3461
01:46:22,260 --> 01:46:22,580
There's two!

3462
01:46:22,700 --> 01:46:23,100
There's two coming!

3463
01:46:23,220 --> 01:46:23,680
They're rushing you!

3464
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:26,480
Oh, my God!

3465
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:29,600
It was, like, three people rushing me.

3466
01:46:29,820 --> 01:46:30,280
I actually made some catching up.

3467
01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:30,880
Yeah.

3468
01:46:31,420 --> 01:46:32,280
Oh, I forgot!

3469
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:33,460
There was, like...

3470
01:46:33,460 --> 01:46:35,260
You should've expected the B rush.

3471
01:46:35,260 --> 01:46:35,300
Yeah.

3472
01:46:36,040 --> 01:46:36,480
Rush B.

3473
01:46:39,800 --> 01:46:40,440
Oh, shit!

3474
01:46:40,500 --> 01:46:41,160
Wait, he got a kill!

3475
01:46:44,220 --> 01:46:44,660
Oh!

3476
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:45,240
Oh!

3477
01:46:46,700 --> 01:46:47,940
Oh, this guy!

3478
01:46:48,700 --> 01:46:49,800
Oh, wait, what was he doing?

3479
01:46:51,160 --> 01:46:51,880
Oh, hey!

3480
01:46:52,260 --> 01:46:53,620
Is he, like, inspecting his gun?

3481
01:46:53,800 --> 01:46:54,660
While shooting?

3482
01:46:58,540 --> 01:46:59,380
It's okay.

3483
01:46:59,620 --> 01:47:00,420
They're only winning...

3484
01:47:00,420 --> 01:47:01,100
This one might be gloss.

3485
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:03,360
No...

3486
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:04,240
I...

3487
01:47:04,240 --> 01:47:06,440
We got this...

3488
01:47:07,240 --> 01:47:09,260
We definitely got this...

3489
01:47:11,660 --> 01:47:13,160
You wanna rush...

3490
01:47:13,160 --> 01:47:13,980
You rush them?

3491
01:47:14,160 --> 01:47:14,760
Okay, yeah.

3492
01:47:15,240 --> 01:47:15,880
Follow you.

3493
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:18,200
Okay.

3494
01:47:18,920 --> 01:47:19,700
Oh, yeah.

3495
01:47:19,900 --> 01:47:19,980
Oh, yeah.

3496
01:47:19,980 --> 01:47:20,480
The only...

3497
01:47:20,480 --> 01:47:22,940
Oh, God!

3498
01:47:23,620 --> 01:47:24,040
Oh, God!

3499
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:24,900
The only...

3500
01:47:24,900 --> 01:47:28,500
The only skins I actually buy with my own money is Fortnite skins.

3501
01:47:32,900 --> 01:47:33,960
Oh, what?

3502
01:47:35,420 --> 01:47:35,840
Oh!

3503
01:47:36,920 --> 01:47:37,040
Oh!

3504
01:47:37,040 --> 01:47:37,060
Oh!

3505
01:47:37,120 --> 01:47:37,500
Wait, Fortnite...

3506
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:38,800
Yeah, well, Fortnite skins are...

3507
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:39,320
To be fair...

3508
01:47:39,320 --> 01:47:40,100
Kind of an investment.

3509
01:47:40,480 --> 01:47:40,720
Yeah, yeah.

3510
01:47:40,720 --> 01:47:41,280
They disappear.

3511
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:42,480
That's true.

3512
01:47:42,640 --> 01:47:43,440
And they're actually good.

3513
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:45,000
Did you see all the...

3514
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:45,600
The...

3515
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:46,080
The...

3516
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:46,660
Father's Day...

3517
01:47:46,660 --> 01:47:47,660
Father's Day skins?

3518
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:48,580
That they did?

3519
01:47:49,020 --> 01:47:50,140
With King of the Hill...

3520
01:47:50,140 --> 01:47:50,520
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3521
01:47:50,540 --> 01:47:51,760
And Cleveland?

3522
01:47:52,520 --> 01:47:53,560
Yeah, I thought...

3523
01:47:53,560 --> 01:47:54,760
I thought they were gonna...

3524
01:47:54,760 --> 01:47:56,900
Put, like, more King of the Hill skins or something.

3525
01:47:56,900 --> 01:47:58,620
But I guess they're just doing it, like...

3526
01:47:58,620 --> 01:47:59,220
I think it's just...

3527
01:47:59,220 --> 01:48:00,220
I think it's, like, nice things.

3528
01:48:00,460 --> 01:48:00,760
Yeah, like at different shows.

3529
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:01,280
Yeah.

3530
01:48:01,560 --> 01:48:03,260
I heard the reason why...

3531
01:48:03,260 --> 01:48:03,740
Homer...

3532
01:48:03,740 --> 01:48:05,520
Homer wasn't in it...

3533
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:08,200
Was because they're planning on doing, like, a Simpsons themed...

3534
01:48:08,200 --> 01:48:08,660
Uh...

3535
01:48:08,660 --> 01:48:09,480
Fortnite event.

3536
01:48:09,960 --> 01:48:10,660
With, like...

3537
01:48:10,660 --> 01:48:11,280
With, like...

3538
01:48:11,280 --> 01:48:12,240
Where you can, like...

3539
01:48:12,240 --> 01:48:14,120
Where you can, like, invade Springfield.

3540
01:48:16,140 --> 01:48:17,220
Oh, okay.

3541
01:48:17,920 --> 01:48:18,440
Oh, that was interesting.

3542
01:48:18,440 --> 01:48:20,220
I feel like there aren't that many playable...

3543
01:48:20,840 --> 01:48:21,720
Simpsons characters.

3544
01:48:22,020 --> 01:48:22,220
I...

3545
01:48:22,220 --> 01:48:24,120
I think you're just gonna play the family.

3546
01:48:24,420 --> 01:48:26,220
I assume you don't play...

3547
01:48:26,220 --> 01:48:27,680
I assume they won't add the children.

3548
01:48:27,900 --> 01:48:29,220
Cause then they'll be like...

3549
01:48:29,220 --> 01:48:29,240
The baby is the baby.

3550
01:48:29,240 --> 01:48:29,320
Yeah.

3551
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:31,940
Cause you don't wanna shoot the kids.

3552
01:48:34,140 --> 01:48:34,580
Like...

3553
01:48:35,220 --> 01:48:36,140
Alright, don't worry.

3554
01:48:36,380 --> 01:48:36,740
Oh, yeah, that too.

3555
01:48:36,880 --> 01:48:38,580
Yeah, I was gonna say...

3556
01:48:38,580 --> 01:48:40,620
I don't think they wanna put children...

3557
01:48:40,620 --> 01:48:41,320
In Fortnite.

3558
01:48:42,300 --> 01:48:43,980
They're long, they're long, they're long.

3559
01:48:44,200 --> 01:48:44,640
Oh my god!

3560
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:47,420
Too busy thinking about the Simpsons.

3561
01:48:47,740 --> 01:48:48,000
Ah!

3562
01:48:51,720 --> 01:48:52,920
I thought we voted to...

3563
01:48:52,920 --> 01:48:53,760
I voted to surrender.

3564
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:54,600
Yeah, I voted too.

3565
01:48:54,940 --> 01:48:55,420
Someone...

3566
01:48:55,420 --> 01:48:57,260
Someone didn't wanna leave.

3567
01:48:57,780 --> 01:48:58,740
Who wants to...

3568
01:48:58,740 --> 01:49:00,240
Someone's trying to stat pat.

3569
01:49:01,900 --> 01:49:03,020
Oh, my Oshi.

3570
01:49:03,240 --> 01:49:04,180
Doki bird's in my lobby.

3571
01:49:04,260 --> 01:49:05,500
I don't wanna click the game yet.

3572
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:06,320
Nyah!

3573
01:49:06,600 --> 01:49:06,920
Oh my god!

3574
01:49:06,940 --> 01:49:08,340
We're never gonna see her again!

3575
01:49:08,920 --> 01:49:09,580
We're never gonna see her!

3576
01:49:09,880 --> 01:49:11,100
Doki and Doobie!

3577
01:49:11,380 --> 01:49:11,920
D&D!

3578
01:49:17,460 --> 01:49:18,900
Hold on, I'm rubbing my eye.

3579
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:20,240
I got really itchy all of a sudden.

3580
01:49:20,860 --> 01:49:21,260
Oh no.

3581
01:49:22,700 --> 01:49:23,720
Clutch or kick?

3582
01:49:23,940 --> 01:49:24,200
Okay.

3583
01:49:25,300 --> 01:49:25,820
Yes.

3584
01:49:26,220 --> 01:49:26,960
Who's voting?

3585
01:49:27,100 --> 01:49:27,340
No.

3586
01:49:27,760 --> 01:49:28,540
Oh, it's passed.

3587
01:49:28,720 --> 01:49:28,860
Nice.

3588
01:49:29,140 --> 01:49:29,460
Yay!

3589
01:49:29,580 --> 01:49:30,540
We're freed!

3590
01:49:32,640 --> 01:49:33,560
We're free!

3591
01:49:35,480 --> 01:49:36,160
Oh my god!

3592
01:49:36,180 --> 01:49:36,740
Clutch king!

3593
01:49:38,620 --> 01:49:39,980
Oh my god!

3594
01:49:40,260 --> 01:49:40,640
Clutch king!

3595
01:49:40,640 --> 01:49:40,920
Nice.

3596
01:49:41,140 --> 01:49:41,320
Nice.

3597
01:49:41,720 --> 01:49:42,840
I don't know what I did.

3598
01:49:44,460 --> 01:49:45,700
But I got it.

3599
01:49:45,880 --> 01:49:46,320
Did I...

3600
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:47,740
That's the 11%...

3601
01:49:47,740 --> 01:49:49,740
Did I say 11% accuracy?

3602
01:49:50,440 --> 01:49:50,680
Yeah.

3603
01:49:52,120 --> 01:49:53,300
Oh, I didn't see.

3604
01:49:53,900 --> 01:49:54,380
Oh.

3605
01:49:54,720 --> 01:49:55,340
Wait, what do I...

3606
01:49:55,340 --> 01:49:56,040
Oh, I got...

3607
01:49:56,040 --> 01:49:57,160
Oh, I'm gonna get a case.

3608
01:49:57,500 --> 01:49:58,540
I'll buy the case.

3609
01:49:59,220 --> 01:49:59,540
Whoa!

3610
01:49:59,800 --> 01:50:01,940
You can totally open it for $2.50!

3611
01:50:02,340 --> 01:50:02,700
Whoa!

3612
01:50:02,860 --> 01:50:03,340
Hey guys!

3613
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:05,640
If only I had $2.50...

3614
01:50:07,940 --> 01:50:09,880
If only I had $2.50?

3615
01:50:09,880 --> 01:50:10,540
Okay.

3616
01:50:10,720 --> 01:50:11,520
Right now!

3617
01:50:15,960 --> 01:50:17,320
If only...

3618
01:50:17,320 --> 01:50:17,880
If only...

3619
01:50:18,820 --> 01:50:18,860
If only...

3620
01:50:18,860 --> 01:50:19,680
Aw, man!

3621
01:50:21,080 --> 01:50:26,160
If only Doobie and I both have $2.50 right now!

3622
01:50:26,600 --> 01:50:26,860
Oh, me too!

3623
01:50:27,380 --> 01:50:27,700
And then...

3624
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:31,100
I only think it was a win!

3625
01:50:31,260 --> 01:50:33,840
If only the super chats were open!

3626
01:50:35,700 --> 01:50:37,060
If only...

3627
01:50:37,060 --> 01:50:39,280
Oh wait, how much are memberships again?

3628
01:50:45,020 --> 01:50:45,440
Someone...

3629
01:50:45,440 --> 01:50:48,540
Oh, so we're gonna play, um...

3630
01:50:49,200 --> 01:50:49,920
Oh, so we're gonna play, um...

3631
01:50:49,920 --> 01:50:50,380
Oh, so we're gonna play wingman.

3632
01:50:50,580 --> 01:50:51,780
It's like 2v2.

3633
01:50:52,100 --> 01:50:52,280
Oh!

3634
01:50:52,820 --> 01:50:53,680
Okay, that sounds fun.

3635
01:50:54,200 --> 01:50:55,940
Someone gave me 2.49.

3636
01:50:56,240 --> 01:50:57,380
Oh, thank you guys!

3637
01:50:57,560 --> 01:50:59,300
For the super chats, guys!

3638
01:51:08,840 --> 01:51:09,260
What?!

3639
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:11,720
Okay, I...

3640
01:51:11,720 --> 01:51:12,680
Maybe I should buy a key.

3641
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:13,780
Wait, how do I buy keys?

3642
01:51:14,140 --> 01:51:15,640
Oh, if you do, just...

3643
01:51:15,640 --> 01:51:16,500
Just hide your screen.

3644
01:51:16,680 --> 01:51:19,260
Because it does like the Steam thing where it shows like your information.

3645
01:51:19,640 --> 01:51:19,840
Oh!

3646
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:19,860
Yeah.

3647
01:51:19,860 --> 01:51:20,120
Okay.

3648
01:51:20,420 --> 01:51:21,260
I don't want that.

3649
01:51:21,480 --> 01:51:23,580
Identity theft is not a joke, guys.

3650
01:51:24,340 --> 01:51:24,740
I...

3651
01:51:24,740 --> 01:51:25,700
Wait, what the...

3652
01:51:26,140 --> 01:51:27,560
Is it the recoil case?

3653
01:51:28,640 --> 01:51:29,440
Unlock container.

3654
01:51:30,440 --> 01:51:31,440
Wait, it's 3...

3655
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:31,740
Oh, wait.

3656
01:51:32,020 --> 01:51:32,540
3.39?

3657
01:51:32,820 --> 01:51:33,380
Oh, it's Canadian.

3658
01:51:33,620 --> 01:51:33,740
Okay.

3659
01:51:34,200 --> 01:51:35,340
I was gonna say...

3660
01:51:35,340 --> 01:51:35,900
Oh, yeah.

3661
01:51:36,020 --> 01:51:36,180
Sorry.

3662
01:51:36,360 --> 01:51:38,520
I was like, oh my god, I can't believe it.

3663
01:51:38,720 --> 01:51:39,200
It's okay.

3664
01:51:39,280 --> 01:51:39,980
It's Canadian.

3665
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:41,560
Alright.

3666
01:51:41,800 --> 01:51:42,100
Oh, wait.

3667
01:51:42,420 --> 01:51:42,740
Got...

3668
01:51:42,740 --> 01:51:44,220
Wait, let me open my case first.

3669
01:51:45,900 --> 01:51:46,260
Alright.

3670
01:51:46,440 --> 01:51:46,560
Oh, okay.

3671
01:51:47,060 --> 01:51:47,740
Take your time.

3672
01:51:48,300 --> 01:51:48,780
Authorized.

3673
01:51:49,060 --> 01:51:51,560
I'm not gonna accept it so I can open my case.

3674
01:51:53,260 --> 01:51:53,740
Alright.

3675
01:51:55,380 --> 01:51:55,860
Uh...

3676
01:51:55,860 --> 01:51:56,800
Don't worry, guys.

3677
01:51:57,300 --> 01:51:59,700
Yeah, you just buy the key and then close it.

3678
01:51:59,880 --> 01:52:00,200
Uh-huh.

3679
01:52:00,500 --> 01:52:01,320
The screen and then...

3680
01:52:01,320 --> 01:52:01,780
I got it.

3681
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:03,460
Then you can unlock after.

3682
01:52:03,620 --> 01:52:03,760
Yeah.

3683
01:52:04,360 --> 01:52:04,600
Okay.

3684
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:07,240
Open to keep.

3685
01:52:07,460 --> 01:52:08,020
Wait, rent?

3686
01:52:09,320 --> 01:52:10,600
Oh, keep one weapon?

3687
01:52:10,840 --> 01:52:11,060
You know.

3688
01:52:11,340 --> 01:52:11,660
Okay.

3689
01:52:12,080 --> 01:52:12,340
Yeah.

3690
01:52:13,020 --> 01:52:13,900
Open to keep.

3691
01:52:14,060 --> 01:52:14,880
Alright, what do I get?

3692
01:52:15,720 --> 01:52:16,760
What did I get?

3693
01:52:16,760 --> 01:52:17,540
Oh.

3694
01:52:17,780 --> 01:52:18,260
Oh.

3695
01:52:18,560 --> 01:52:18,920
Oh.

3696
01:52:19,640 --> 01:52:20,120
Wow!

3697
01:52:21,260 --> 01:52:21,960
Oh, it's a blue.

3698
01:52:22,280 --> 01:52:22,520
Hello!

3699
01:52:22,620 --> 01:52:23,660
It's a FAMAS.

3700
01:52:23,900 --> 01:52:24,760
The Meow36.

3701
01:52:26,840 --> 01:52:27,320
It's...

3702
01:52:27,320 --> 01:52:27,520
Wow!

3703
01:52:27,600 --> 01:52:28,940
Is it a cat skin?

3704
01:52:30,100 --> 01:52:30,580
No.

3705
01:52:30,940 --> 01:52:31,300
Wait, no.

3706
01:52:31,380 --> 01:52:32,160
There's a fish on it.

3707
01:52:32,220 --> 01:52:33,440
Where the fuck is the cat part?

3708
01:52:36,120 --> 01:52:38,220
It just has a fish on it.

3709
01:52:38,360 --> 01:52:38,960
Maybe because you're the cat and you're holding the fish.

3710
01:52:38,980 --> 01:52:39,580
Oh, that's true.

3711
01:52:39,900 --> 01:52:40,420
That's true.

3712
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:41,840
Still kitty time.

3713
01:52:42,480 --> 01:52:44,440
Yeah, I was gonna say, where the fuck's the cat?

3714
01:52:44,940 --> 01:52:45,740
It's just...

3715
01:52:45,740 --> 01:52:46,620
Cats aren't green.

3716
01:52:49,280 --> 01:52:52,100
Doesn't that make you wanna open 50 more cases?

3717
01:52:52,520 --> 01:52:54,180
I'll open 50 if you open 50.

3718
01:52:57,480 --> 01:52:58,380
Maybe next time.

3719
01:52:59,240 --> 01:53:02,240
I opened a bunch of cases recently and I didn't get shit.

3720
01:53:02,520 --> 01:53:04,160
Wait, what was the best you got?

3721
01:53:07,020 --> 01:53:11,320
I think there was like an M4 skin.

3722
01:53:11,600 --> 01:53:12,540
What color was it?

3723
01:53:12,780 --> 01:53:13,260
Like purple?

3724
01:53:13,680 --> 01:53:13,940
Pink?

3725
01:53:14,160 --> 01:53:14,460
Red?

3726
01:53:14,940 --> 01:53:15,400
Blue?

3727
01:53:17,160 --> 01:53:18,260
Hold on, I gotta check.

3728
01:53:18,320 --> 01:53:19,400
It'll show up in my inventory.

3729
01:53:19,940 --> 01:53:21,980
Oh, I have the five-year veteran coin.

3730
01:53:22,160 --> 01:53:22,460
No, actually...

3731
01:53:23,060 --> 01:53:25,040
I just got a sawed-off shotgun skin.

3732
01:53:25,040 --> 01:53:25,480
Oh, yeah.

3733
01:53:25,560 --> 01:53:27,060
The stat track M4A4.

3734
01:53:27,220 --> 01:53:27,680
It was a purple.

3735
01:53:28,660 --> 01:53:28,840
Oh!

3736
01:53:29,780 --> 01:53:31,260
Oh, that's like almost a red.

3737
01:53:31,380 --> 01:53:32,980
Wait, I have the 10-year veteran coin.

3738
01:53:33,120 --> 01:53:33,660
Oh my God.

3739
01:53:35,380 --> 01:53:35,900
What?

3740
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:36,580
Nice.

3741
01:53:37,220 --> 01:53:40,700
I literally played CSGO like one time ten years ago.

3742
01:53:41,100 --> 01:53:42,080
That's all it takes.

3743
01:53:42,120 --> 01:53:43,180
That's all it takes.

3744
01:53:43,180 --> 01:53:45,200
I got the 10-year coin.

3745
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:45,460
Yeah.

3746
01:53:45,640 --> 01:53:49,580
And I got the Halo Master Chief Collection music kit, guys.

3747
01:53:51,060 --> 01:53:51,620
Alright.

3748
01:53:51,920 --> 01:53:52,440
I'm ready.

3749
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:53,340
Oh, we're still searching.

3750
01:53:54,140 --> 01:53:55,480
I'm a 10-year vet.

3751
01:53:55,800 --> 01:53:56,320
Yeah, we had a game, but then...

3752
01:53:56,320 --> 01:53:57,040
Oh, the...

3753
01:53:57,040 --> 01:53:58,180
Yeah, and then somebody...

3754
01:53:59,100 --> 01:54:00,120
Not me.

3755
01:54:01,780 --> 01:54:02,340
Somebody.

3756
01:54:02,800 --> 01:54:03,360
Somebody.

3757
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:04,720
Gambling.

3758
01:54:05,620 --> 01:54:06,740
Gambling legally.

3759
01:54:07,400 --> 01:54:07,420
There was a...

3760
01:54:07,420 --> 01:54:08,360
There was a streamer.

3761
01:54:09,080 --> 01:54:09,460
Yeah?

3762
01:54:09,820 --> 01:54:13,160
There was a streamer and they spent like a hundred thousand dollars in it.

3763
01:54:13,160 --> 01:54:14,460
Cases to...

3764
01:54:14,460 --> 01:54:14,720
What?

3765
01:54:14,820 --> 01:54:18,940
Open up like that amount worth of cases on stream.

3766
01:54:19,340 --> 01:54:20,200
Jesus Christ.

3767
01:54:20,520 --> 01:54:22,520
And they only made back like...

3768
01:54:22,520 --> 01:54:24,720
I think 10% of how much they spent.

3769
01:54:24,740 --> 01:54:25,440
What the fuck?

3770
01:54:25,440 --> 01:54:26,660
Because they got two knives.

3771
01:54:27,020 --> 01:54:27,740
Oh, two knives.

3772
01:54:27,900 --> 01:54:28,460
Yeah, I mean...

3773
01:54:28,460 --> 01:54:28,740
Yeah.

3774
01:54:28,980 --> 01:54:30,420
There's no way like...

3775
01:54:30,420 --> 01:54:30,580
Yeah.

3776
01:54:30,580 --> 01:54:34,300
I know like the most expensive knife isn't even close to 100k.

3777
01:54:34,540 --> 01:54:35,260
That's crazy.

3778
01:54:36,720 --> 01:54:38,940
I hear like knives are like...

3779
01:54:38,940 --> 01:54:39,060
Yeah.

3780
01:54:39,060 --> 01:54:41,900
I hear like knives are a good way to money launder too.

3781
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:45,360
Wait, did you hear about that?

3782
01:54:45,680 --> 01:54:46,100
I...

3783
01:54:46,100 --> 01:54:46,720
But...

3784
01:54:46,720 --> 01:54:47,360
No.

3785
01:54:47,540 --> 01:54:48,920
But who's gonna buy the knives?

3786
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:49,580
I don't like...

3787
01:54:49,580 --> 01:54:51,640
It's just like a way to launder money.

3788
01:54:51,800 --> 01:54:53,000
So like they...

3789
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,580
They like sell the knife for really, really expensive.

3790
01:54:55,760 --> 01:54:56,860
It's like art galleries.

3791
01:54:57,180 --> 01:54:58,800
Sometimes people like do money launder.

3792
01:54:58,840 --> 01:54:59,080
Right.

3793
01:54:59,340 --> 01:54:59,760
Allegedly.

3794
01:54:59,960 --> 01:55:00,140
Sorry.

3795
01:55:00,640 --> 01:55:01,880
Allegedly in Minecraft.

3796
01:55:02,340 --> 01:55:02,740
Allegedly.

3797
01:55:02,940 --> 01:55:03,520
We don't know.

3798
01:55:03,780 --> 01:55:04,000
Yeah.

3799
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:04,300
Yeah.

3800
01:55:04,520 --> 01:55:05,440
I read this off of Twitter.

3801
01:55:05,700 --> 01:55:07,320
So it can't be true, guys.

3802
01:55:09,680 --> 01:55:10,160
Uh...

3803
01:55:11,060 --> 01:55:11,540
Ow.

3804
01:55:13,660 --> 01:55:14,400
No way.

3805
01:55:14,620 --> 01:55:15,320
It's true, guys.

3806
01:55:17,480 --> 01:55:21,120
You can form your own opinions on whether or not that's true.

3807
01:55:24,500 --> 01:55:24,940
Alright.

3808
01:55:25,660 --> 01:55:26,320
First half.

3809
01:55:26,480 --> 01:55:27,060
Oh, we're terrorists.

3810
01:55:27,340 --> 01:55:27,640
Nice.

3811
01:55:27,960 --> 01:55:28,100
Alright, so...

3812
01:55:28,100 --> 01:55:29,980
This is pretty much what we were playing.

3813
01:55:30,400 --> 01:55:30,800
Yeah.

3814
01:55:31,060 --> 01:55:31,320
Okay.

3815
01:55:31,460 --> 01:55:32,160
This is a different map.

3816
01:55:32,260 --> 01:55:32,920
This is a classic.

3817
01:55:33,060 --> 01:55:33,980
Everybody loves this map.

3818
01:55:34,160 --> 01:55:34,580
Alright.

3819
01:55:34,660 --> 01:55:36,000
I got my Desert Eagle.

3820
01:55:37,420 --> 01:55:38,080
And uh...

3821
01:55:38,080 --> 01:55:39,000
There's only one site.

3822
01:55:39,180 --> 01:55:39,440
Oh no.

3823
01:55:39,580 --> 01:55:39,800
Okay.

3824
01:55:40,100 --> 01:55:41,080
Yeah, there's only one site.

3825
01:55:41,260 --> 01:55:42,900
But there's like multiple entry points.

3826
01:55:43,280 --> 01:55:43,640
Okay.

3827
01:55:44,800 --> 01:55:45,860
Let's hope they're bad.

3828
01:55:45,860 --> 01:55:45,900
Let's hope they're bad.

3829
01:55:46,780 --> 01:55:47,200
There's...

3830
01:55:47,720 --> 01:55:48,140
Uh...

3831
01:55:48,140 --> 01:55:49,080
A door there.

3832
01:55:49,260 --> 01:55:49,860
There's a vent.

3833
01:55:50,060 --> 01:55:50,460
Here.

3834
01:55:50,460 --> 01:55:51,280
They can come out of.

3835
01:55:51,460 --> 01:55:53,000
Oh, there's so many places.

3836
01:55:53,740 --> 01:55:54,900
I'm a little scared.

3837
01:55:56,560 --> 01:55:56,980
Yeah.

3838
01:55:57,260 --> 01:55:57,360
But I...

3839
01:55:57,360 --> 01:55:57,960
I'll just follow you.

3840
01:55:57,960 --> 01:55:59,400
I actually don't know where they spawn here.

3841
01:55:59,560 --> 01:56:01,160
So I...

3842
01:56:01,640 --> 01:56:03,060
And so this is squeaky.

3843
01:56:03,440 --> 01:56:03,980
There it goes.

3844
01:56:04,200 --> 01:56:04,520
Oh.

3845
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:06,440
Yeah, it goes squeak.

3846
01:56:06,820 --> 01:56:07,000
Squeak.

3847
01:56:07,740 --> 01:56:08,160
Squeaky.

3848
01:56:08,360 --> 01:56:08,620
Bye bye.

3849
01:56:09,820 --> 01:56:10,640
Oh, there's one.

3850
01:56:10,680 --> 01:56:11,360
I saw one guy.

3851
01:56:11,960 --> 01:56:12,660
Where was he?

3852
01:56:13,960 --> 01:56:14,360
Oh.

3853
01:56:15,360 --> 01:56:19,420
Um, so one is on site and one is like really close on site.

3854
01:56:20,100 --> 01:56:20,940
Wait, where am I going?

3855
01:56:21,080 --> 01:56:22,720
So if you go out that way, there's a window.

3856
01:56:23,120 --> 01:56:25,740
Go up the stairs and there's gonna be a glass window.

3857
01:56:26,120 --> 01:56:26,480
Uh-huh.

3858
01:56:27,500 --> 01:56:27,860
Yeah.

3859
01:56:28,040 --> 01:56:29,880
And he's like right outside the glass window.

3860
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:30,920
That's where he was at least.

3861
01:56:32,580 --> 01:56:33,800
I didn't know where I am.

3862
01:56:35,480 --> 01:56:35,880
Hi.

3863
01:56:37,840 --> 01:56:38,240
No.

3864
01:56:41,680 --> 01:56:42,480
That's my...

3865
01:56:42,980 --> 01:56:44,100
Okay, there's a guy right here.

3866
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:44,380
Right here.

3867
01:56:44,480 --> 01:56:44,640
Right here.

3868
01:56:44,640 --> 01:56:44,680
Right here.

3869
01:56:44,800 --> 01:56:45,180
Sorry.

3870
01:56:45,460 --> 01:56:46,080
I saw...

3871
01:56:46,080 --> 01:56:47,020
I didn't see your name.

3872
01:56:47,240 --> 01:56:49,800
I didn't see the name on top of your head.

3873
01:56:50,080 --> 01:56:51,980
I thought that was an enemy.

3874
01:56:52,620 --> 01:56:52,920
I...

3875
01:56:55,800 --> 01:56:56,840
That's why I said hi.

3876
01:56:58,240 --> 01:56:58,680
Who

3877
01:57:03,880 --> 01:57:04,620
could that be?

3878
01:57:06,960 --> 01:57:07,900
Hey, I hit you.

3879
01:57:08,120 --> 01:57:09,260
That was your name right there.

3880
01:57:09,340 --> 01:57:09,880
I hit you.

3881
01:57:10,100 --> 01:57:10,340
Yeah.

3882
01:57:10,340 --> 01:57:10,420
Yeah.

3883
01:57:10,820 --> 01:57:11,340
Yeah.

3884
01:57:11,640 --> 01:57:13,240
If only you were the enemy.

3885
01:57:14,100 --> 01:57:14,740
Got it.

3886
01:57:15,240 --> 01:57:16,020
There's a scale.

3887
01:57:16,460 --> 01:57:16,920
There's...

3888
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:19,500
They're pushing.

3889
01:57:19,640 --> 01:57:19,940
They're pushing.

3890
01:57:20,400 --> 01:57:21,740
Don't worry, I'm right here.

3891
01:57:22,620 --> 01:57:24,840
I'll try not to shoot you this time.

3892
01:57:31,120 --> 01:57:32,200
A lot of footsteps.

3893
01:57:37,730 --> 01:57:39,650
I think they're on the...

3894
01:57:39,830 --> 01:57:40,930
It's just really loud.

3895
01:57:42,730 --> 01:57:43,710
What the fuck?

3896
01:57:45,130 --> 01:57:47,690
I don't know where they like position and stuff.

3897
01:57:48,110 --> 01:57:48,590
It's so weird.

3898
01:57:49,230 --> 01:57:49,410
Yeah.

3899
01:57:49,810 --> 01:57:50,310
Me neither.

3900
01:57:51,670 --> 01:57:52,770
Cause usually on this...

3901
01:57:52,770 --> 01:57:53,490
On this map...

3902
01:57:54,230 --> 01:57:55,450
This is like underneath...

3903
01:57:55,450 --> 01:57:56,430
How do you open the door?

3904
01:57:56,770 --> 01:57:56,790
The main site.

3905
01:57:57,990 --> 01:57:58,730
Oh, E.

3906
01:57:59,930 --> 01:58:00,610
Oh, I see you.

3907
01:58:00,650 --> 01:58:01,510
There's one guy up here.

3908
01:58:01,690 --> 01:58:02,450
Like up in the...

3909
01:58:02,450 --> 01:58:03,990
I saw one guy up on that.

3910
01:58:05,870 --> 01:58:06,170
Oh.

3911
01:58:06,510 --> 01:58:07,630
Hey, he's lit up there.

3912
01:58:07,810 --> 01:58:08,050
Okay.

3913
01:58:08,370 --> 01:58:08,390
Nice.

3914
01:58:09,190 --> 01:58:10,050
I got Kevin.

3915
01:58:11,270 --> 01:58:11,650
Oh!

3916
01:58:12,690 --> 01:58:13,850
I didn't get him though.

3917
01:58:13,850 --> 01:58:14,810
How much did you hit him for?

3918
01:58:15,050 --> 01:58:15,430
19.

3919
01:58:17,210 --> 01:58:18,310
Alright, what's the 39?

3920
01:58:18,770 --> 01:58:19,390
Oh wait, no, 39.

3921
01:58:20,010 --> 01:58:20,890
Oh, that was so close.

3922
01:58:20,910 --> 01:58:21,910
I just need to hit one more shot.

3923
01:58:23,670 --> 01:58:25,230
Oh, I don't have...

3924
01:58:25,230 --> 01:58:26,750
How do I sell back?

3925
01:58:26,750 --> 01:58:28,450
I think I have an idea.

3926
01:58:29,150 --> 01:58:29,590
Okay.

3927
01:58:29,950 --> 01:58:30,750
Wait, actually...

3928
01:58:32,850 --> 01:58:33,290
Uh...

3929
01:58:33,290 --> 01:58:34,710
Oh, you can sell back stuff.

3930
01:58:35,130 --> 01:58:35,730
That's fine.

3931
01:58:35,870 --> 01:58:37,270
I'll spend everything I have.

3932
01:58:37,390 --> 01:58:37,850
You go to scout?

3933
01:58:38,170 --> 01:58:38,990
Yeah, it's time.

3934
01:58:40,990 --> 01:58:42,990
They might push if you wanna wait for them.

3935
01:58:43,290 --> 01:58:43,550
Okay.

3936
01:58:44,070 --> 01:58:44,950
Oh, look at this side.

3937
01:58:45,790 --> 01:58:46,850
I'm gonna make noise.

3938
01:58:46,850 --> 01:58:48,070
Like I'm pushing this way.

3939
01:58:48,210 --> 01:58:48,430
Alright.

3940
01:58:52,630 --> 01:58:53,750
I don't think they're...

3941
01:58:53,750 --> 01:58:54,150
I don't...

3942
01:58:54,150 --> 01:58:55,590
I think they're just playing the wait game.

3943
01:58:57,470 --> 01:58:57,910
Yeah.

3944
01:58:59,130 --> 01:59:00,390
Oh, look at this side.

3945
01:59:04,820 --> 01:59:05,180
Yeah.

3946
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:07,360
Oh.

3947
01:59:07,580 --> 01:59:08,340
They opened the door.

3948
01:59:08,500 --> 01:59:08,980
They closed.

3949
01:59:10,040 --> 01:59:11,060
Oh, they closed it.

3950
01:59:11,120 --> 01:59:11,980
Oh, they opened the one they found.

3951
01:59:11,980 --> 01:59:12,480
Oh, shit!

3952
01:59:13,520 --> 01:59:13,880
Aww.

3953
01:59:15,480 --> 01:59:16,120
Oh, nice.

3954
01:59:16,220 --> 01:59:16,680
I must bait.

3955
01:59:16,780 --> 01:59:17,160
Let's go!

3956
01:59:19,500 --> 01:59:20,700
No, I didn't mean to.

3957
01:59:21,260 --> 01:59:21,620
Yay!

3958
01:59:24,520 --> 01:59:25,700
Did I even hit him?

3959
01:59:25,820 --> 01:59:26,460
I didn't even hit him.

3960
01:59:26,600 --> 01:59:27,340
Wait, actually, I don't know.

3961
01:59:32,520 --> 01:59:34,280
I'm surprised they pushed up.

3962
01:59:42,230 --> 01:59:42,830
Oh!

3963
01:59:43,110 --> 01:59:43,710
Oh!

3964
01:59:45,010 --> 01:59:46,010
Goddamn Kevin!

3965
01:59:48,830 --> 01:59:49,430
No!

3966
01:59:50,450 --> 01:59:51,350
Oh, nice.

3967
01:59:51,730 --> 01:59:51,950
Okay.

3968
01:59:51,950 --> 01:59:52,370
That's not fair.

3969
01:59:52,830 --> 01:59:54,010
This side is hard to push.

3970
01:59:55,630 --> 01:59:57,810
Okay, I realize I'm not a scout person.

3971
01:59:57,990 --> 01:59:58,970
I'm just gonna do Desert Eagle.

3972
01:59:59,210 --> 01:59:59,890
Let's call my brother.

3973
02:00:00,370 --> 02:00:01,850
I should start saving my money.

3974
02:00:01,910 --> 02:00:02,390
Yeah, you're good with it.

3975
02:00:03,230 --> 02:00:04,850
I should start saving.

3976
02:00:05,810 --> 02:00:06,130
Alright.

3977
02:00:12,560 --> 02:00:14,340
I can't believe they used util.

3978
02:00:16,120 --> 02:00:16,600
Yeah.

3979
02:00:16,940 --> 02:00:17,300
Cheaters.

3980
02:00:17,600 --> 02:00:18,540
I used it.

3981
02:00:18,680 --> 02:00:19,100
A little bit.

3982
02:00:21,840 --> 02:00:24,520
I have not used util once.

3983
02:00:25,080 --> 02:00:26,440
He's gonna break the window for now.

3984
02:00:26,660 --> 02:00:27,100
I'll distract him over here.

3985
02:00:27,580 --> 02:00:27,680
Okay.

3986
02:00:28,080 --> 02:00:28,140
Oh!

3987
02:00:28,380 --> 02:00:30,340
One's, uh...

3988
02:00:30,340 --> 02:00:31,560
He's sitting on the ramp.

3989
02:00:32,240 --> 02:00:32,940
Oh my god!

3990
02:00:33,740 --> 02:00:34,720
What the fuck?

3991
02:00:34,840 --> 02:00:35,500
He grenaded me.

3992
02:00:36,360 --> 02:00:37,160
Oh my god.

3993
02:00:37,300 --> 02:00:37,720
Losers.

3994
02:00:38,480 --> 02:00:39,540
Alright, I'm gonna...

3995
02:00:39,540 --> 02:00:40,000
Okay.

3996
02:00:40,520 --> 02:00:41,600
I'm gonna flash that.

3997
02:00:41,700 --> 02:00:41,900
Alright.

3998
02:00:42,900 --> 02:00:43,920
You can do...

3999
02:00:43,920 --> 02:00:44,820
What the...

4000
02:00:44,820 --> 02:00:45,700
I hate this!

4001
02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:47,080
You can destroy the door!

4002
02:00:49,480 --> 02:00:51,620
Yeah, I forgot to tell you about that.

4003
02:00:51,780 --> 02:00:53,360
He destroyed the door!

4004
02:01:02,860 --> 02:01:03,380
Oh.

4005
02:01:04,160 --> 02:01:04,940
I think he's close.

4006
02:01:05,860 --> 02:01:06,200
Oh.

4007
02:01:07,180 --> 02:01:07,880
I see.

4008
02:01:08,740 --> 02:01:09,780
Oh my god.

4009
02:01:10,340 --> 02:01:10,720
This is...

4010
02:01:10,720 --> 02:01:12,800
You only have like three entry points.

4011
02:01:12,800 --> 02:01:14,520
And they're all kind of at a weird...

4012
02:01:14,520 --> 02:01:15,000
It feels like...

4013
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:15,620
I have a plan.

4014
02:01:15,800 --> 02:01:17,200
It feels like CT sided.

4015
02:01:17,380 --> 02:01:18,040
Not gonna lie.

4016
02:01:18,580 --> 02:01:18,940
Yeah.

4017
02:01:19,580 --> 02:01:19,720
Yeah.

4018
02:01:20,760 --> 02:01:21,120
Okay.

4019
02:01:21,240 --> 02:01:21,600
What's your plan?

4020
02:01:22,040 --> 02:01:22,380
Follow me.

4021
02:01:22,620 --> 02:01:23,160
Don't worry.

4022
02:01:23,420 --> 02:01:24,260
I gotta go near this side.

4023
02:01:24,260 --> 02:01:24,640
I'm gonna go to the double doors.

4024
02:01:24,720 --> 02:01:25,560
And I'm gonna...

4025
02:01:26,520 --> 02:01:27,240
Smoke outside.

4026
02:01:27,360 --> 02:01:28,120
And then...

4027
02:01:28,120 --> 02:01:29,080
We're gonna go left.

4028
02:01:29,560 --> 02:01:29,840
Wait.

4029
02:01:29,880 --> 02:01:30,500
Can you open...

4030
02:01:30,500 --> 02:01:30,800
Okay.

4031
02:01:30,860 --> 02:01:30,980
Hold on.

4032
02:01:31,060 --> 02:01:31,580
Just wait for that.

4033
02:01:31,820 --> 02:01:32,180
Okay.

4034
02:01:32,900 --> 02:01:33,940
I'm a little worried.

4035
02:01:35,160 --> 02:01:36,220
There's one guy that's gonna...

4036
02:01:36,220 --> 02:01:36,740
Wait.

4037
02:01:36,900 --> 02:01:37,720
I just saw him.

4038
02:01:39,380 --> 02:01:40,660
I'm gonna look back here.

4039
02:01:45,180 --> 02:01:45,540
Alright.

4040
02:01:45,600 --> 02:01:45,920
Open the...

4041
02:01:45,920 --> 02:01:46,760
Can you open the doors for me?

4042
02:01:46,800 --> 02:01:47,420
But don't peek it.

4043
02:01:47,420 --> 02:01:48,140
Okay.

4044
02:01:48,300 --> 02:01:48,840
I got you.

4045
02:01:49,020 --> 02:01:50,600
You should be able to like stand right there.

4046
02:01:50,780 --> 02:01:51,700
And press E on it.

4047
02:01:53,220 --> 02:01:53,640
Sorry.

4048
02:01:53,640 --> 02:01:54,420
I didn't give you a countdown.

4049
02:01:55,460 --> 02:01:57,280
I just went damn open.

4050
02:01:58,760 --> 02:01:59,180
Alright.

4051
02:01:59,200 --> 02:02:00,480
I'm gonna run out into the smoke.

4052
02:02:01,060 --> 02:02:01,360
Okay.

4053
02:02:01,360 --> 02:02:02,040
I'm going left.

4054
02:02:02,260 --> 02:02:02,680
Onto site.

4055
02:02:05,480 --> 02:02:06,900
I'm stuck against something.

4056
02:02:07,220 --> 02:02:07,540
Wait.

4057
02:02:07,740 --> 02:02:08,240
I know where I am.

4058
02:02:10,720 --> 02:02:11,520
Where are they?

4059
02:02:11,660 --> 02:02:12,140
I'm on the site.

4060
02:02:12,260 --> 02:02:13,100
There's a guy above me.

4061
02:02:13,560 --> 02:02:13,820
Aww.

4062
02:02:14,080 --> 02:02:14,680
I see him.

4063
02:02:14,820 --> 02:02:14,960
Yeah.

4064
02:02:15,700 --> 02:02:16,680
He's up in the...

4065
02:02:16,680 --> 02:02:16,860
Aww.

4066
02:02:17,260 --> 02:02:17,500
What?

4067
02:02:19,920 --> 02:02:20,320
Okay.

4068
02:02:20,540 --> 02:02:20,620
Wait.

4069
02:02:20,720 --> 02:02:21,000
Are they...

4070
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:21,420
Is this...

4071
02:02:21,420 --> 02:02:22,460
Does this have SPMM?

4072
02:02:22,780 --> 02:02:24,200
Or is it like anything...

4073
02:02:24,200 --> 02:02:24,500
Anybody?

4074
02:02:25,940 --> 02:02:26,740
I'm just curious.

4075
02:02:27,140 --> 02:02:27,840
I don't know what that means.

4076
02:02:27,840 --> 02:02:28,320
Oh.

4077
02:02:28,420 --> 02:02:29,360
Is this like...

4078
02:02:29,960 --> 02:02:31,980
Is there like rank based matchmaking?

4079
02:02:32,580 --> 02:02:34,080
Like based off your skill level?

4080
02:02:34,400 --> 02:02:34,840
Or...

4081
02:02:36,060 --> 02:02:37,820
Or is it just like a free for all?

4082
02:02:38,160 --> 02:02:38,840
But not...

4083
02:02:38,840 --> 02:02:39,020
For this one?

4084
02:02:39,340 --> 02:02:40,340
Not in this mode.

4085
02:02:40,640 --> 02:02:40,740
Okay.

4086
02:02:40,960 --> 02:02:40,980
Okay.

4087
02:02:40,980 --> 02:02:42,420
This mode I think it's like free for all.

4088
02:02:42,580 --> 02:02:42,760
Yeah.

4089
02:02:42,920 --> 02:02:44,460
These guys...

4090
02:02:44,960 --> 02:02:47,320
I feel like these guys know what they're doing.

4091
02:02:48,360 --> 02:02:49,100
For sure.

4092
02:02:49,600 --> 02:02:50,640
I was like...

4093
02:02:50,640 --> 02:02:51,260
What the fu...

4094
02:02:51,260 --> 02:02:51,920
Oh my...

4095
02:02:51,920 --> 02:02:53,560
He just walks up the door?

4096
02:02:55,080 --> 02:02:55,520
What?

4097
02:02:56,160 --> 02:02:58,620
I opened it and he just walked up.

4098
02:02:59,780 --> 02:03:00,260
Yeah.

4099
02:03:00,800 --> 02:03:02,720
I feel like that guy is screen sniping.

4100
02:03:04,120 --> 02:03:05,700
Cause he knew where I was.

4101
02:03:05,840 --> 02:03:06,140
I don't know.

4102
02:03:06,260 --> 02:03:07,280
Well, I did throw a nade.

4103
02:03:07,940 --> 02:03:09,700
I think they just...

4104
02:03:09,700 --> 02:03:11,940
They're very, very coordinated.

4105
02:03:13,820 --> 02:03:14,300
Yeah.

4106
02:03:14,700 --> 02:03:17,940
I also think if we started on CT, it would've been a lot easier.

4107
02:03:18,220 --> 02:03:18,440
Yeah.

4108
02:03:18,900 --> 02:03:20,420
That feels CT sided.

4109
02:03:22,860 --> 02:03:24,240
I'm gonna go to the other door.

4110
02:03:24,240 --> 02:03:25,580
Fuck these guys.

4111
02:03:25,980 --> 02:03:26,360
Okay.

4112
02:03:28,160 --> 02:03:29,720
These guys know what they're doing.

4113
02:03:37,570 --> 02:03:38,050
Alright.

4114
02:03:38,110 --> 02:03:39,950
One guy is like here on this short ramp.

4115
02:03:41,090 --> 02:03:41,570
Uh...

4116
02:03:41,570 --> 02:03:42,610
I don't even know if I hit Kevin.

4117
02:03:43,650 --> 02:03:44,710
Did I got you Kevin?

4118
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:52,480
Okay.

4119
02:03:52,620 --> 02:03:54,180
That nade shoots shit.

4120
02:03:54,460 --> 02:03:54,760
Like...

4121
02:03:54,760 --> 02:03:54,900
That's...

4122
02:03:54,900 --> 02:03:56,180
They corey nade that shit.

4123
02:03:56,400 --> 02:03:56,920
They're like...

4124
02:03:56,920 --> 02:03:58,020
Three, two, one.

4125
02:03:58,300 --> 02:03:59,500
I nade you shoot.

4126
02:03:59,860 --> 02:04:01,360
There's no fucking way.

4127
02:04:01,720 --> 02:04:02,000
There's...

4128
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:02,780
Oh, I did hit Kevin.

4129
02:04:02,780 --> 02:04:03,820
That's all I care about.

4130
02:04:04,160 --> 02:04:04,520
I...

4131
02:04:05,960 --> 02:04:06,360
Nice.

4132
02:04:07,080 --> 02:04:07,900
Alright, it's fine.

4133
02:04:08,040 --> 02:04:08,900
That's a victory there.

4134
02:04:08,900 --> 02:04:09,800
Alright, I have another plan.

4135
02:04:10,060 --> 02:04:10,420
Okay.

4136
02:04:10,440 --> 02:04:11,260
Follow me, follow me.

4137
02:04:11,380 --> 02:04:11,980
Alright, I follow.

4138
02:04:12,380 --> 02:04:13,500
We're gonna go...

4139
02:04:13,500 --> 02:04:14,120
Hold on.

4140
02:04:14,260 --> 02:04:14,920
I don't wanna say.

4141
02:04:17,940 --> 02:04:19,480
We could be anywhere.

4142
02:04:20,320 --> 02:04:21,260
Where could we be?

4143
02:04:22,860 --> 02:04:23,780
Let me see.

4144
02:04:28,420 --> 02:04:30,480
Bro, these fucking nades are crazy though.

4145
02:04:30,580 --> 02:04:31,080
Not gonna lie.

4146
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:38,560
Oh.

4147
02:04:40,280 --> 02:04:41,540
I'm scared now.

4148
02:04:42,080 --> 02:04:42,100
Oh.

4149
02:04:43,380 --> 02:04:48,580
If you go down there and peek that door, he's gonna be like directly straight from where you peek.

4150
02:04:50,460 --> 02:04:51,220
The orange one.

4151
02:04:51,220 --> 02:04:51,560
That's right!

4152
02:04:51,760 --> 02:04:52,420
Fuck you, Kevin!

4153
02:04:52,580 --> 02:04:53,340
Oh, that's not Kevin.

4154
02:04:54,280 --> 02:04:54,740
God damn it.

4155
02:04:54,780 --> 02:04:55,480
I wish that was Kevin.

4156
02:04:56,980 --> 02:05:00,640
He's up there and he could be walking up to the catwalk that's above you.

4157
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:04,140
Where are you, Kevin?

4158
02:05:04,740 --> 02:05:05,300
Like, across.

4159
02:05:05,520 --> 02:05:05,700
Across.

4160
02:05:06,100 --> 02:05:06,420
Yeah, above.

4161
02:05:07,300 --> 02:05:08,460
Kevin, where are you?

4162
02:05:12,310 --> 02:05:13,090
I'm scared.

4163
02:05:16,230 --> 02:05:17,470
Where the fuck is he?

4164
02:05:17,470 --> 02:05:18,090
40 seconds.

4165
02:05:18,570 --> 02:05:19,490
Oh my god.

4166
02:05:19,730 --> 02:05:20,210
He's above you.

4167
02:05:20,890 --> 02:05:22,290
If you go out and turn left.

4168
02:05:25,490 --> 02:05:26,530
Where the fuck is he?

4169
02:05:29,390 --> 02:05:30,090
Bro, fuck.

4170
02:05:30,090 --> 02:05:31,410
He can be up there on a...

4171
02:05:31,410 --> 02:05:31,930
If you smoke.

4172
02:05:32,310 --> 02:05:32,970
Pull out your... nevermind.

4173
02:05:33,070 --> 02:05:34,030
Fuck you, Kevin!

4174
02:05:34,510 --> 02:05:34,930
Nice!

4175
02:05:34,930 --> 02:05:35,410
Fuck you!

4176
02:05:35,650 --> 02:05:36,290
We got one!

4177
02:05:37,110 --> 02:05:37,430
I did it!

4178
02:05:37,690 --> 02:05:38,510
That's right!

4179
02:05:39,310 --> 02:05:40,130
That's right!

4180
02:05:40,650 --> 02:05:42,090
I got you, Kevin!

4181
02:05:45,150 --> 02:05:45,550
Nice.

4182
02:05:45,990 --> 02:05:51,510
Oh, so another strat people do is like, they'll throw their smoke onto the site and then just get the bomb down.

4183
02:05:51,930 --> 02:05:52,230
Oh.

4184
02:05:53,270 --> 02:05:53,650
Okay.

4185
02:05:53,930 --> 02:05:54,930
I don't know where the...

4186
02:05:54,930 --> 02:05:55,170
Okay.

4187
02:05:55,270 --> 02:05:55,390
Yeah.

4188
02:05:55,970 --> 02:05:56,310
Oh wait.

4189
02:05:56,530 --> 02:05:57,330
Oh, we're defending now.

4190
02:05:57,350 --> 02:05:57,590
Nice.

4191
02:05:57,850 --> 02:05:59,670
And if you right click with smoke...

4192
02:05:59,670 --> 02:06:00,110
Where do we go?

4193
02:06:00,570 --> 02:06:01,610
Oh shit, where do we go?

4194
02:06:02,010 --> 02:06:03,150
Where do we go?

4195
02:06:03,450 --> 02:06:04,770
I'm like, where am I?

4196
02:06:05,890 --> 02:06:07,090
They're already here!

4197
02:06:07,330 --> 02:06:08,170
Oh my god.

4198
02:06:08,330 --> 02:06:08,550
That's...

4199
02:06:08,550 --> 02:06:09,330
One squeaky, yeah.

4200
02:06:09,630 --> 02:06:10,690
Oh my god.

4201
02:06:12,110 --> 02:06:14,950
I was not ready for them to insta-push.

4202
02:06:16,830 --> 02:06:17,810
Yeah, same.

4203
02:06:18,430 --> 02:06:19,210
Oh, I almost got him!

4204
02:06:19,210 --> 02:06:20,550
How did they get where they were so fast?

4205
02:06:20,730 --> 02:06:22,270
I just need to hit one more shot.

4206
02:06:22,570 --> 02:06:24,550
Yeah, like, they knew instantly where to go.

4207
02:06:24,830 --> 02:06:25,270
They're cheating!

4208
02:06:27,290 --> 02:06:28,170
Uh-huh.

4209
02:06:29,370 --> 02:06:31,590
Oh my, how dare they know map knowledge?

4210
02:06:31,830 --> 02:06:32,890
How fucking dare they?

4211
02:06:36,580 --> 02:06:37,000
No!

4212
02:06:37,380 --> 02:06:37,780
Nice, we got him.

4213
02:06:38,240 --> 02:06:39,820
Wait, there's a guy behind me!

4214
02:06:40,520 --> 02:06:42,180
Oh, he was on the goddamn Kevin!

4215
02:06:42,180 --> 02:06:43,060
He was on the window.

4216
02:06:46,520 --> 02:06:47,700
I flashed myself!

4217
02:06:48,080 --> 02:06:49,500
I was like, wait a minute.

4218
02:06:49,940 --> 02:06:50,460
Oh, nice!

4219
02:06:50,660 --> 02:06:50,840
Yeah!

4220
02:06:52,400 --> 02:06:52,880
Nice!

4221
02:06:53,480 --> 02:06:54,120
It's alright.

4222
02:06:54,360 --> 02:06:57,540
We, we like, nerf ourselves because it was too easy.

4223
02:06:59,580 --> 02:07:00,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4224
02:07:00,640 --> 02:07:01,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4225
02:07:02,560 --> 02:07:03,740
It was just too easy.

4226
02:07:04,240 --> 02:07:05,060
It worked.

4227
02:07:07,020 --> 02:07:07,420
Okay.

4228
02:07:08,640 --> 02:07:11,520
Oh my god, these guys position, like, instantly.

4229
02:07:12,300 --> 02:07:12,700
I don't have a strat now.

4230
02:07:14,400 --> 02:07:14,800
Yeah.

4231
02:07:14,800 --> 02:07:16,460
I look at the window, I guess.

4232
02:07:19,420 --> 02:07:20,920
Okay, you watch window, I'll watch you.

4233
02:07:26,610 --> 02:07:30,110
I'm watching window, and I'm watching that door, and I'm watching- Oh, no!

4234
02:07:30,250 --> 02:07:30,870
They're on the right!

4235
02:07:33,410 --> 02:07:34,670
Oh my god.

4236
02:07:35,050 --> 02:07:38,190
Wait, how did he- Because I guess I- He just walked out.

4237
02:07:38,210 --> 02:07:38,710
That was a nice try.

4238
02:07:39,890 --> 02:07:40,190
Yeah.

4239
02:07:40,190 --> 02:07:40,270
Yeah.

4240
02:07:41,290 --> 02:07:44,150
The fearless that died 10 times.

4241
02:07:44,770 --> 02:07:45,490
Thanks, game.

4242
02:07:46,070 --> 02:07:46,430
Thank you.

4243
02:07:46,430 --> 02:07:48,330
Yeah, I should've been watching it from where I was.

4244
02:07:49,950 --> 02:07:50,390
Shoot.

4245
02:07:51,090 --> 02:07:53,070
Oh, does it tell them how- I wanna know their ranks.

4246
02:07:53,330 --> 02:07:54,650
Let me know your rank!

4247
02:07:56,570 --> 02:07:58,190
I wanna- Wait, what's that?

4248
02:07:58,250 --> 02:07:58,570
Oh wait.

4249
02:07:59,030 --> 02:08:00,350
Oh wait, their private rank?

4250
02:08:00,490 --> 02:08:01,490
Oh, Master Surgeon?

4251
02:08:03,130 --> 02:08:04,210
Is that a good rank?

4252
02:08:04,430 --> 02:08:05,190
Master Sergeant?

4253
02:08:06,690 --> 02:08:09,050
I think that's just, like, the- Like, your level.

4254
02:08:09,050 --> 02:08:10,330
Like, how much- Oh, is that your level?

4255
02:08:10,710 --> 02:08:11,070
Oh!

4256
02:08:11,990 --> 02:08:12,350
Yeah.

4257
02:08:12,970 --> 02:08:13,750
Oh, I see.

4258
02:08:13,990 --> 02:08:14,810
Yeah, I got confused.

4259
02:08:15,690 --> 02:08:16,410
I'm Corporal.

4260
02:08:16,610 --> 02:08:16,770
Aw.

4261
02:08:16,910 --> 02:08:17,730
Nice, let me go.

4262
02:08:18,230 --> 02:08:18,610
You know what?

4263
02:08:18,630 --> 02:08:19,170
Let's do it again.

4264
02:08:19,250 --> 02:08:20,150
Let's do another 2v2.

4265
02:08:20,410 --> 02:08:21,110
I believe.

4266
02:08:21,510 --> 02:08:21,870
Okay.

4267
02:08:22,270 --> 02:08:23,210
I believe in this.

4268
02:08:23,390 --> 02:08:24,530
Do you wanna do a different map?

4269
02:08:24,870 --> 02:08:25,750
Let's do Dust.

4270
02:08:26,990 --> 02:08:27,790
Wait, do they have Dust?

4271
02:08:27,790 --> 02:08:29,290
Oh, they don't have it for Wingman.

4272
02:08:29,510 --> 02:08:29,530
Aw.

4273
02:08:30,250 --> 02:08:31,470
Alright, your favorite one.

4274
02:08:31,470 --> 02:08:32,050
Yeah, 2v2, they don't have it.

4275
02:08:35,750 --> 02:08:37,030
Okay, I'll just do these.

4276
02:08:38,090 --> 02:08:38,570
Or...

4277
02:08:38,570 --> 02:08:39,850
Hold on, let me...

4278
02:08:39,850 --> 02:08:40,450
Let me hear me.

4279
02:08:42,570 --> 02:08:43,050
Oh.

4280
02:08:44,510 --> 02:08:44,990
Inferno?

4281
02:08:45,270 --> 02:08:46,370
Oh, that's chicken, right?

4282
02:08:46,610 --> 02:08:46,850
What?

4283
02:08:47,150 --> 02:08:48,130
You're watching!

4284
02:08:51,930 --> 02:08:53,170
No, my shirt!

4285
02:08:53,890 --> 02:08:54,370
Oh!

4286
02:08:54,470 --> 02:08:54,810
Oh, wait, oh.

4287
02:08:55,310 --> 02:08:56,070
Guys, no!

4288
02:08:56,210 --> 02:08:57,090
We're doing...

4289
02:08:57,090 --> 02:08:58,550
We're doing Inferno, guys!

4290
02:08:58,550 --> 02:08:59,170
We're doing...

4291
02:09:01,730 --> 02:09:02,130
Whoops!

4292
02:09:04,070 --> 02:09:04,770
It's okay.

4293
02:09:05,010 --> 02:09:06,690
We're doing Inferno, guys!

4294
02:09:07,250 --> 02:09:07,750
Don't look!

4295
02:09:07,970 --> 02:09:08,490
Don't look!

4296
02:09:11,010 --> 02:09:11,950
Close your eyes!

4297
02:09:12,330 --> 02:09:13,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4298
02:09:13,050 --> 02:09:13,250
Hold on.

4299
02:09:13,370 --> 02:09:14,230
Wait, I gotta get something.

4300
02:09:14,370 --> 02:09:15,550
I forgot I ordered something earlier.

4301
02:09:15,870 --> 02:09:16,050
Oh, alright.

4302
02:09:16,150 --> 02:09:17,170
I left it at the front door.

4303
02:09:17,510 --> 02:09:17,990
Yeah, no problem.

4304
02:09:18,330 --> 02:09:19,210
I'm like...

4305
02:09:19,210 --> 02:09:19,910
I'll be right back.

4306
02:09:19,910 --> 02:09:20,590
Alright.

4307
02:09:20,770 --> 02:09:21,450
Alright, guys.

4308
02:09:21,610 --> 02:09:23,910
I'm queuing up Inferno right now, guys.

4309
02:09:24,170 --> 02:09:25,350
Let's see who gets in first.

4310
02:09:25,570 --> 02:09:25,910
Let's see...

4311
02:09:28,550 --> 02:09:29,870
That's a chicken map, right?

4312
02:09:30,230 --> 02:09:32,110
The one where you stab chickens?

4313
02:09:35,150 --> 02:09:36,510
Yeah, pretend you don't see.

4314
02:09:36,630 --> 02:09:37,310
Close your eyes.

4315
02:09:37,550 --> 02:09:38,090
Close your eyes.

4316
02:09:38,190 --> 02:09:38,450
Queue up.

4317
02:09:38,510 --> 02:09:39,750
I'm queuing up right now, guys.

4318
02:09:39,970 --> 02:09:41,230
Totally queuing up Inferno.

4319
02:09:42,350 --> 02:09:42,790
Uh...

4320
02:09:42,790 --> 02:09:43,290
Oh!

4321
02:09:43,650 --> 02:09:44,130
You know what we should...

4322
02:09:44,130 --> 02:09:44,270
Wait.

4323
02:09:44,450 --> 02:09:45,150
Did they...

4324
02:09:45,150 --> 02:09:47,610
Did Doobie name the Doobirds yet?

4325
02:09:47,970 --> 02:09:49,210
Are you guys named yet?

4326
02:09:49,250 --> 02:09:50,250
Or are you guys still nameless?

4327
02:09:50,870 --> 02:09:52,090
I was gonna say...

4328
02:09:52,090 --> 02:09:55,090
Dragoons and the Doobirds should do a 2v2 and see who wins.

4329
02:09:58,390 --> 02:09:59,550
Who is the strongest?

4330
02:10:00,910 --> 02:10:02,510
Oh, you guys are still nameless?

4331
02:10:03,210 --> 02:10:04,390
You guys are still orphans?

4332
02:10:05,470 --> 02:10:05,970
I don't know.

4333
02:10:06,770 --> 02:10:07,490
Wait, Doobie!

4334
02:10:07,590 --> 02:10:09,690
You haven't named your Doobirds yet?

4335
02:10:09,930 --> 02:10:09,970
Yeah.

4336
02:10:13,210 --> 02:10:14,810
Did you just call them orphans?

4337
02:10:15,170 --> 02:10:15,370
Yeah.

4338
02:10:19,250 --> 02:10:19,690
Um...

4339
02:10:24,290 --> 02:10:24,970
Oh, yeah.

4340
02:10:25,050 --> 02:10:25,810
They don't have a name yet.

4341
02:10:26,070 --> 02:10:26,230
Yeah.

4342
02:10:27,630 --> 02:10:28,070
Mother...

4343
02:10:31,350 --> 02:10:32,090
I am...

4344
02:10:32,090 --> 02:10:33,170
I'm campaigning for Doobirds.

4345
02:10:33,810 --> 02:10:34,250
Minions?

4346
02:10:34,630 --> 02:10:35,350
The Minions?

4347
02:10:36,010 --> 02:10:37,490
Oh my god, they're Minions.

4348
02:10:37,590 --> 02:10:38,310
They can be like...

4349
02:10:38,310 --> 02:10:38,730
Doobirds too?

4350
02:10:38,730 --> 02:10:40,750
They can be like...

4351
02:10:40,750 --> 02:10:40,950
They can be like...

4352
02:10:42,130 --> 02:10:42,570
Like...

4353
02:10:43,510 --> 02:10:44,910
Yeah, I was gonna say banana!

4354
02:10:45,390 --> 02:10:46,770
Because it's yellow too!

4355
02:10:47,250 --> 02:10:48,370
They can be like...

4356
02:10:48,370 --> 02:10:49,850
They can be like...

4357
02:10:49,850 --> 02:10:50,010
Yeah.

4358
02:10:50,570 --> 02:10:51,990
They can carry like bananas around.

4359
02:10:52,130 --> 02:10:54,130
And then you can give them like the little overalls and stuff.

4360
02:10:54,430 --> 02:10:55,770
My outfit is...

4361
02:10:56,930 --> 02:10:57,890
Is like...

4362
02:10:57,890 --> 02:10:59,250
Kind of minion coated.

4363
02:10:59,530 --> 02:10:59,630
Yeah!

4364
02:10:59,910 --> 02:11:00,070
Yeah!

4365
02:11:00,490 --> 02:11:01,170
And then all...

4366
02:11:01,690 --> 02:11:02,870
All of them can like...

4367
02:11:02,870 --> 02:11:04,570
Wear the little like minion outfits.

4368
02:11:05,250 --> 02:11:05,630
And it's...

4369
02:11:05,630 --> 02:11:07,110
And you have the goggles too!

4370
02:11:07,650 --> 02:11:07,890
Yeah!

4371
02:11:08,890 --> 02:11:10,250
Yeah, I was gonna put them on.

4372
02:11:10,390 --> 02:11:11,530
That's why I'm still...

4373
02:11:12,570 --> 02:11:13,330
Here we go.

4374
02:11:16,050 --> 02:11:16,530
Alright.

4375
02:11:16,930 --> 02:11:17,790
Minion coated.

4376
02:11:18,690 --> 02:11:19,670
Take this again.

4377
02:11:19,850 --> 02:11:20,330
Uh-huh.

4378
02:11:21,190 --> 02:11:21,570
Oh!

4379
02:11:21,790 --> 02:11:22,090
Oh!

4380
02:11:22,230 --> 02:11:22,490
Oh!

4381
02:11:22,510 --> 02:11:22,790
Oh my god!

4382
02:11:22,810 --> 02:11:23,630
You're like a little minion!

4383
02:11:27,950 --> 02:11:28,570
Oh my god!

4384
02:11:28,710 --> 02:11:29,410
She is a minion!

4385
02:11:29,630 --> 02:11:29,830
Don't do banana!

4386
02:11:33,570 --> 02:11:34,890
Alright, who is this?

4387
02:11:35,190 --> 02:11:36,110
Who are we fighting?

4388
02:11:36,510 --> 02:11:37,270
Oh my god!

4389
02:11:37,390 --> 02:11:37,810
It's them!

4390
02:11:37,810 --> 02:11:38,510
I think...

4391
02:11:38,510 --> 02:11:39,830
There's only two...

4392
02:11:39,830 --> 02:11:41,170
Four people queuing up.

4393
02:11:41,650 --> 02:11:41,670
No!

4394
02:11:42,630 --> 02:11:43,250
I'm pretty!

4395
02:11:43,410 --> 02:11:43,950
There's only four!

4396
02:11:43,970 --> 02:11:45,190
Why are we on T side again?

4397
02:11:45,270 --> 02:11:46,530
This is messed up!

4398
02:11:46,670 --> 02:11:47,350
Can we just leave?

4399
02:11:48,530 --> 02:11:50,110
Do we get penalty for leaving?

4400
02:11:50,410 --> 02:11:51,150
I mean...

4401
02:11:51,150 --> 02:11:51,950
Yeah, technically...

4402
02:11:51,950 --> 02:11:52,390
No, I don't...

4403
02:11:52,390 --> 02:11:54,470
I think it should be okay if you really want to.

4404
02:11:54,550 --> 02:11:55,210
We could try though.

4405
02:11:55,310 --> 02:11:56,510
Alright, let's try...

4406
02:11:56,510 --> 02:11:57,250
Against them.

4407
02:11:58,990 --> 02:11:59,770
Okay, I...

4408
02:11:59,770 --> 02:12:00,330
Where do we go?

4409
02:12:00,550 --> 02:12:00,750
How does this work?

4410
02:12:01,010 --> 02:12:01,830
Cause there's only...

4411
02:12:01,830 --> 02:12:02,930
Yeah, I was gonna say.

4412
02:12:03,210 --> 02:12:05,090
Well, obviously they just rush out.

4413
02:12:06,450 --> 02:12:07,530
There's A and B.

4414
02:12:07,530 --> 02:12:09,290
Wait, this map is so fucking big!

4415
02:12:09,750 --> 02:12:10,470
Okay, I think we should only go to A.

4416
02:12:12,230 --> 02:12:13,630
Wait, this map is huge!

4417
02:12:13,870 --> 02:12:14,490
Can we also go to B site?

4418
02:12:14,830 --> 02:12:15,210
Yeah!

4419
02:12:15,910 --> 02:12:16,390
Oh...

4420
02:12:16,390 --> 02:12:17,310
No, B site is...

4421
02:12:17,310 --> 02:12:18,530
It's closed off.

4422
02:12:19,630 --> 02:12:20,110
Oh...

4423
02:12:20,110 --> 02:12:20,750
Can't...

4424
02:12:20,750 --> 02:12:20,990
Oh!

4425
02:12:21,190 --> 02:12:22,070
Oh my god!

4426
02:12:23,190 --> 02:12:24,650
I don't know where I am.

4427
02:12:25,090 --> 02:12:25,350
I...

4428
02:12:27,510 --> 02:12:29,170
I don't know where I am.

4429
02:12:32,920 --> 02:12:34,520
Were they close or were they far?

4430
02:12:34,640 --> 02:12:34,820
Oops.

4431
02:12:35,480 --> 02:12:35,960
That's...

4432
02:12:35,960 --> 02:12:36,660
They were there.

4433
02:12:37,320 --> 02:12:38,800
That's my dead body!

4434
02:12:39,760 --> 02:12:40,460
Oh, he's over there.

4435
02:12:44,230 --> 02:12:45,070
Oh, nice!

4436
02:12:45,250 --> 02:12:45,670
Nice shot!

4437
02:12:47,630 --> 02:12:48,790
Wait, what gun is that?

4438
02:12:52,730 --> 02:12:54,030
This is the USPS.

4439
02:12:54,170 --> 02:12:55,130
This is just the CT gun.

4440
02:12:56,290 --> 02:12:56,430
Oh!

4441
02:12:57,430 --> 02:12:57,850
Damn it!

4442
02:12:58,130 --> 02:12:59,410
That's okay, you killed Kevin.

4443
02:13:01,030 --> 02:13:02,150
That's all that matters.

4444
02:13:04,070 --> 02:13:05,210
I hate that name.

4445
02:13:05,210 --> 02:13:05,890
Yeah!

4446
02:13:06,210 --> 02:13:06,730
Fuck Kevin!

4447
02:13:07,050 --> 02:13:08,530
All you Kevins out there!

4448
02:13:08,810 --> 02:13:09,230
Fuck you!

4449
02:13:11,290 --> 02:13:13,250
Change your name legally now!

4450
02:13:13,570 --> 02:13:15,270
This guy ruined it for all of you!

4451
02:13:15,370 --> 02:13:15,590
Yeah!

4452
02:13:16,050 --> 02:13:16,410
He...

4453
02:13:16,410 --> 02:13:19,610
He ruined Kevin for all of you Kevins out there!

4454
02:13:19,790 --> 02:13:21,330
All my homies hate Kevin!

4455
02:13:22,150 --> 02:13:23,670
Legally change your name now!

4456
02:13:25,370 --> 02:13:25,810
Yeah!

4457
02:13:26,110 --> 02:13:28,470
Or maybe you can do a shortened version of Kevin or something.

4458
02:13:28,750 --> 02:13:28,970
Kev!

4459
02:13:29,390 --> 02:13:29,570
Kev!

4460
02:13:29,570 --> 02:13:30,050
Kev, yeah!

4461
02:13:30,950 --> 02:13:31,390
Kevlar?

4462
02:13:31,610 --> 02:13:32,030
Kevlar?

4463
02:13:33,790 --> 02:13:34,790
Oh, you're gonna go that way?

4464
02:13:34,990 --> 02:13:35,190
Yeah!

4465
02:13:36,010 --> 02:13:37,250
But I hear people up here.

4466
02:13:37,430 --> 02:13:37,590
Okay.

4467
02:13:39,030 --> 02:13:40,270
Because that can't be you.

4468
02:13:41,130 --> 02:13:42,310
You're here for me.

4469
02:13:42,810 --> 02:13:42,970
Yeah!

4470
02:13:42,970 --> 02:13:42,990
Yeah!

4471
02:13:44,050 --> 02:13:44,610
Oh!

4472
02:13:44,770 --> 02:13:45,130
JK!

4473
02:13:45,350 --> 02:13:45,790
I lied!

4474
02:13:51,090 --> 02:13:52,470
Okay, maybe not.

4475
02:13:52,710 --> 02:13:53,410
Kevin is a minion!

4476
02:13:53,950 --> 02:13:54,210
Oh!

4477
02:13:54,510 --> 02:13:55,390
Not anymore!

4478
02:13:59,230 --> 02:14:00,390
Kicking Kevin out.

4479
02:14:00,690 --> 02:14:01,790
He's getting fired tonight.

4480
02:14:05,620 --> 02:14:06,480
What the fuck?

4481
02:14:07,960 --> 02:14:09,800
I'm so confused with this map.

4482
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:11,380
This is the map I see the least.

4483
02:14:11,960 --> 02:14:12,440
For sure.

4484
02:14:14,320 --> 02:14:15,460
Oh, that's my shadow.

4485
02:14:15,500 --> 02:14:16,440
Yeah, this one...

4486
02:14:18,180 --> 02:14:20,260
They're both sitting, like, further ahead.

4487
02:14:22,940 --> 02:14:23,420
What?!

4488
02:14:23,420 --> 02:14:23,820
No!

4489
02:14:24,080 --> 02:14:24,280
No!

4490
02:14:25,780 --> 02:14:26,940
Oh, my God!

4491
02:14:28,220 --> 02:14:28,700
50?!

4492
02:14:29,260 --> 02:14:31,260
That was on his fucking chest!

4493
02:14:31,540 --> 02:14:34,360
I swear to God, I hid his intestines and he was gonna bleed out.

4494
02:14:34,380 --> 02:14:35,000
Yeah, but great armor!

4495
02:14:37,240 --> 02:14:37,720
Awww...

4496
02:14:39,220 --> 02:14:42,420
If you move forward a little bit, and you hit his head, that would've been good.

4497
02:14:43,700 --> 02:14:44,140
Um...

4498
02:14:44,140 --> 02:14:45,020
I just...

4499
02:14:45,020 --> 02:14:48,260
I just thought that, like, I'm gonna make sure he...

4500
02:14:48,260 --> 02:14:50,660
I'm gonna hit his kidney and he'll bleed out or some shit.

4501
02:14:50,660 --> 02:14:51,180
I don't know.

4502
02:14:55,100 --> 02:14:56,660
It takes a while, is all.

4503
02:14:56,860 --> 02:14:57,240
Alright, wait.

4504
02:14:57,280 --> 02:14:57,840
Walk, walk.

4505
02:14:58,220 --> 02:14:58,560
Okay.

4506
02:15:01,240 --> 02:15:02,060
What the fuck?

4507
02:15:02,340 --> 02:15:03,180
He's close, he's close.

4508
02:15:03,380 --> 02:15:04,460
What the fuck?!

4509
02:15:04,460 --> 02:15:05,500
Oh, my God!

4510
02:15:05,560 --> 02:15:06,660
He scared the shit out of me!

4511
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:08,060
He heard us jump.

4512
02:15:09,420 --> 02:15:12,680
Alright, so the other guy should be pretty far, I think, for now.

4513
02:15:12,860 --> 02:15:13,200
Kind of...

4514
02:15:13,200 --> 02:15:14,840
I don't even know where they can come from.

4515
02:15:15,140 --> 02:15:15,540
Like, come from here.

4516
02:15:15,540 --> 02:15:15,660
Like, come from here.

4517
02:15:15,660 --> 02:15:16,300
Can he come from here?

4518
02:15:19,260 --> 02:15:19,660
Um...

4519
02:15:19,660 --> 02:15:20,540
He could, I guess.

4520
02:15:23,080 --> 02:15:23,480
Alright.

4521
02:15:23,900 --> 02:15:25,600
Can you cover this area and then I'll plant it?

4522
02:15:25,600 --> 02:15:26,240
Yeah, sure.

4523
02:15:26,460 --> 02:15:27,020
Are you watching it?

4524
02:15:27,560 --> 02:15:27,960
Maybe.

4525
02:15:29,500 --> 02:15:30,300
Oh, shit!

4526
02:15:30,720 --> 02:15:31,400
Where every...

4527
02:15:31,400 --> 02:15:32,180
He shot me from the back.

4528
02:15:32,460 --> 02:15:32,640
I...

4529
02:15:32,640 --> 02:15:34,020
I don't know where...

4530
02:15:35,340 --> 02:15:36,260
Wait, what?

4531
02:15:40,360 --> 02:15:41,160
The shotgun.

4532
02:15:41,480 --> 02:15:42,500
Where did he come from?

4533
02:15:44,420 --> 02:15:45,460
I'm so confused.

4534
02:15:45,660 --> 02:15:46,840
Um, I think he went all the way around.

4535
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:49,660
So he must have pushed from, like, where we pushed the last time.

4536
02:15:50,540 --> 02:15:52,020
He teleported behind me.

4537
02:15:53,260 --> 02:15:54,040
Let's go that way.

4538
02:15:54,400 --> 02:15:54,660
Alright.

4539
02:15:57,720 --> 02:15:58,400
He started blasting.

4540
02:15:58,420 --> 02:16:01,120
So I thought in this map, um, a lot of people use it.

4541
02:16:01,300 --> 02:16:02,580
Because it's kind of good on this map.

4542
02:16:03,080 --> 02:16:03,580
Oh, shit.

4543
02:16:03,760 --> 02:16:04,400
Yeah, I can tell that.

4544
02:16:04,600 --> 02:16:05,640
Don't worry, I'll...

4545
02:16:05,640 --> 02:16:06,180
Oh, my God.

4546
02:16:07,940 --> 02:16:08,660
He's close!

4547
02:16:08,980 --> 02:16:09,620
Oh, nice!

4548
02:16:10,180 --> 02:16:10,680
We did it!

4549
02:16:10,820 --> 02:16:11,220
Oh, my God!

4550
02:16:11,360 --> 02:16:12,100
What the fuck?

4551
02:16:12,480 --> 02:16:13,280
Okay, let's...

4552
02:16:13,280 --> 02:16:14,860
You're just gonna rush that.

4553
02:16:14,900 --> 02:16:15,720
I feel like.

4554
02:16:15,880 --> 02:16:17,120
We could just wait for them, right?

4555
02:16:19,600 --> 02:16:22,360
Maybe they're watching the stream and they know which way we're going.

4556
02:16:22,600 --> 02:16:22,960
Cause...

4557
02:16:22,960 --> 02:16:23,360
I don't know.

4558
02:16:23,480 --> 02:16:23,960
I don't know.

4559
02:16:24,660 --> 02:16:25,220
Well, let's go again.

4560
02:16:25,340 --> 02:16:26,200
Yeah, maybe we can wait for them.

4561
02:16:26,400 --> 02:16:26,480
Yeah.

4562
02:16:26,660 --> 02:16:27,060
Let's try that.

4563
02:16:28,500 --> 02:16:29,140
Let's try it.

4564
02:16:29,280 --> 02:16:29,640
Let's try it.

4565
02:16:29,760 --> 02:16:31,040
Now we'll know for sure if they're...

4566
02:16:31,040 --> 02:16:31,240
Yeah.

4567
02:16:32,960 --> 02:16:33,580
That's right.

4568
02:16:33,700 --> 02:16:34,160
Oh, they're coming.

4569
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:36,960
There's just one, though.

4570
02:16:38,940 --> 02:16:40,700
Yeah, there's one on A and one here.

4571
02:16:40,840 --> 02:16:41,120
Yeah.

4572
02:16:45,800 --> 02:16:47,100
I looked down the stairs.

4573
02:16:48,860 --> 02:16:49,800
Just in case.

4574
02:16:51,140 --> 02:16:53,260
There's only four people playing wingman.

4575
02:16:53,520 --> 02:16:54,420
Isn't that sad?

4576
02:16:57,780 --> 02:17:00,520
Because you have to be queued up with a duo, so maybe...

4577
02:17:00,520 --> 02:17:01,080
Oh, really?

4578
02:17:01,300 --> 02:17:03,180
There aren't people trying to queue it, but...

4579
02:17:03,180 --> 02:17:04,020
I think so.

4580
02:17:06,060 --> 02:17:06,760
Oh, my God.

4581
02:17:07,060 --> 02:17:07,940
What's that sound?

4582
02:17:09,460 --> 02:17:10,520
I'm so paranoid.

4583
02:17:14,610 --> 02:17:16,090
Like, where could they come from?

4584
02:17:16,090 --> 02:17:16,630
I don't know.

4585
02:17:17,730 --> 02:17:19,710
This map is making me so paranoid.

4586
02:17:19,710 --> 02:17:21,150
He's super close right here.

4587
02:17:22,670 --> 02:17:23,970
I think... was that you jumping?

4588
02:17:24,230 --> 02:17:25,150
No, that was not me.

4589
02:17:25,230 --> 02:17:25,730
I didn't jump.

4590
02:17:27,570 --> 02:17:28,590
Okay, I'm gonna peek this.

4591
02:17:28,850 --> 02:17:29,650
This guy's close.

4592
02:17:37,310 --> 02:17:38,110
Alright, we have...

4593
02:17:38,110 --> 02:17:39,330
We don't have a lot of time, so I'm rushing.

4594
02:17:39,690 --> 02:17:39,930
Alright.

4595
02:17:50,530 --> 02:17:51,650
Oh, where was he?

4596
02:17:53,410 --> 02:17:53,890
Um...

4597
02:17:53,890 --> 02:17:54,570
They were both on A.

4598
02:17:55,050 --> 02:17:56,030
They were on A?

4599
02:17:56,270 --> 02:17:58,550
Which kind of makes sense that they would both sit there.

4600
02:17:58,890 --> 02:17:59,290
Because...

4601
02:17:59,290 --> 02:18:00,890
Yeah, that's the only...

4602
02:18:00,890 --> 02:18:02,930
Site we can play like that.

4603
02:18:04,110 --> 02:18:07,030
He just ran straight to me and I got...

4604
02:18:07,030 --> 02:18:07,870
I got exploded.

4605
02:18:10,470 --> 02:18:11,290
Alright, so we'll...

4606
02:18:11,290 --> 02:18:12,050
I guess...

4607
02:18:12,050 --> 02:18:15,190
We'll be more aggressive pushing them in this area.

4608
02:18:15,190 --> 02:18:15,430
Yeah, I guess so.

4609
02:18:15,650 --> 02:18:16,230
We just run?

4610
02:18:19,290 --> 02:18:19,730
Yeah.

4611
02:18:20,510 --> 02:18:21,390
No, there's one guy close.

4612
02:18:22,250 --> 02:18:23,650
Oh, I think they heard us for sure.

4613
02:18:23,990 --> 02:18:24,290
Here, here.

4614
02:18:25,050 --> 02:18:25,490
Alright, don't worry.

4615
02:18:25,490 --> 02:18:26,210
Stand on my head.

4616
02:18:26,330 --> 02:18:28,530
And you can look over the...

4617
02:18:28,530 --> 02:18:28,890
Okay.

4618
02:18:33,330 --> 02:18:34,150
He's right there!

4619
02:18:34,390 --> 02:18:35,170
He's right there!

4620
02:18:35,390 --> 02:18:36,470
Is he boosted?

4621
02:18:36,630 --> 02:18:37,310
I don't know!

4622
02:18:37,550 --> 02:18:38,210
Was he?

4623
02:18:38,490 --> 02:18:39,250
Oh, shit!

4624
02:18:39,570 --> 02:18:40,230
Oh, shit!

4625
02:18:40,350 --> 02:18:41,270
I don't know where I am!

4626
02:18:42,070 --> 02:18:42,570
No!

4627
02:18:43,390 --> 02:18:43,890
Aww!

4628
02:18:44,690 --> 02:18:45,230
That was close!

4629
02:18:45,330 --> 02:18:46,070
I hit him for 88.

4630
02:18:46,670 --> 02:18:47,170
Aww!

4631
02:18:48,190 --> 02:18:49,550
They did the same plan!

4632
02:18:49,690 --> 02:18:51,210
They had the same idea!

4633
02:18:51,430 --> 02:18:52,610
They actually...

4634
02:18:52,610 --> 02:18:52,870
Yeah, yeah!

4635
02:18:53,290 --> 02:18:53,570
Yeah!

4636
02:18:53,910 --> 02:18:54,590
Stop it!

4637
02:18:57,190 --> 02:18:57,870
Alright, let's...

4638
02:18:57,870 --> 02:18:58,450
Let's...

4639
02:18:59,160 --> 02:19:00,330
This is ramp over here.

4640
02:19:00,450 --> 02:19:00,590
Okay.

4641
02:19:00,590 --> 02:19:01,670
So we'll do a ramp rush.

4642
02:19:04,370 --> 02:19:05,750
It's like, wait a minute.

4643
02:19:08,750 --> 02:19:10,570
I was not expecting that.

4644
02:19:10,570 --> 02:19:11,950
They could come out here.

4645
02:19:12,630 --> 02:19:13,550
Oh, they smoked?

4646
02:19:18,290 --> 02:19:19,030
Watching that.

4647
02:19:23,610 --> 02:19:24,050
Oh!

4648
02:19:24,350 --> 02:19:24,930
Damn it!

4649
02:19:25,390 --> 02:19:25,570
Sorry.

4650
02:19:26,070 --> 02:19:26,430
Where is he?

4651
02:19:27,170 --> 02:19:27,970
He's on site.

4652
02:19:28,190 --> 02:19:29,330
They're both on site, I think.

4653
02:19:29,750 --> 02:19:31,410
They're gonna be pushing you to your right.

4654
02:19:31,570 --> 02:19:32,550
Yeah, like, right up there.

4655
02:19:34,450 --> 02:19:34,890
Aww!

4656
02:19:35,430 --> 02:19:36,070
Oh, nice try.

4657
02:19:36,710 --> 02:19:40,730
I was like, where's site again?

4658
02:19:40,730 --> 02:19:42,550
I was so...

4659
02:19:42,550 --> 02:19:44,750
I was like, where am I supposed to look?

4660
02:19:45,850 --> 02:19:47,910
I wasn't even sure where it was.

4661
02:19:51,790 --> 02:19:52,390
Sorry.

4662
02:19:52,790 --> 02:19:53,350
Bless you.

4663
02:19:54,630 --> 02:19:55,310
Thank you.

4664
02:19:55,890 --> 02:19:56,530
I just...

4665
02:19:56,530 --> 02:19:57,890
I'm drinking coffee, so...

4666
02:19:57,890 --> 02:19:58,530
Oh...

4667
02:19:58,530 --> 02:19:59,790
You're like, caffeinated.

4668
02:20:00,710 --> 02:20:01,230
Like a little...

4669
02:20:01,230 --> 02:20:01,530
Yeah!

4670
02:20:01,930 --> 02:20:02,590
Not yet.

4671
02:20:02,870 --> 02:20:03,790
It hasn't kicked in yet.

4672
02:20:06,890 --> 02:20:07,710
Yeah.

4673
02:20:08,690 --> 02:20:09,570
Think they know?

4674
02:20:10,660 --> 02:20:11,610
No way.

4675
02:20:20,770 --> 02:20:22,330
Slowly going up.

4676
02:20:22,570 --> 02:20:24,210
I may or may not die.

4677
02:20:29,740 --> 02:20:30,560
He's...

4678
02:20:30,560 --> 02:20:31,440
Aw!

4679
02:20:31,620 --> 02:20:32,940
Jesus Christ!

4680
02:20:33,600 --> 02:20:34,620
These guys are...

4681
02:20:34,620 --> 02:20:35,360
You guys are good.

4682
02:20:35,380 --> 02:20:36,200
Stream sniping.

4683
02:20:36,200 --> 02:20:36,420
No!

4684
02:20:40,740 --> 02:20:41,420
It's okay.

4685
02:20:41,620 --> 02:20:42,860
Now we're counter terrorists.

4686
02:20:42,900 --> 02:20:44,280
This is definitely CT sided.

4687
02:20:46,560 --> 02:20:49,480
Maybe we can just sit on site since, uh...

4688
02:20:49,480 --> 02:20:49,760
Yeah.

4689
02:20:50,760 --> 02:20:51,240
Okay.

4690
02:20:51,660 --> 02:20:51,980
So...

4691
02:20:51,980 --> 02:20:54,980
Somebody could watch here, and then somebody can watch, like...

4692
02:20:54,980 --> 02:20:55,600
To the left.

4693
02:20:55,920 --> 02:20:56,060
Okay.

4694
02:20:57,020 --> 02:21:00,200
Like, if you stand here, then you'll be able to see them coming from here.

4695
02:21:00,760 --> 02:21:02,240
And then I'll watch the other side.

4696
02:21:02,460 --> 02:21:02,720
Okay.

4697
02:21:04,900 --> 02:21:06,180
They might get there before me, though.

4698
02:21:06,300 --> 02:21:06,580
I don't know.

4699
02:21:06,660 --> 02:21:06,800
Wait.

4700
02:21:06,900 --> 02:21:07,660
Actually, I don't know where to watch.

4701
02:21:10,160 --> 02:21:10,800
I'm just...

4702
02:21:11,180 --> 02:21:11,780
Staying here.

4703
02:21:15,870 --> 02:21:16,190
Oh!

4704
02:21:16,390 --> 02:21:16,890
Is that you?

4705
02:21:17,070 --> 02:21:17,310
Oh!

4706
02:21:17,590 --> 02:21:17,710
No.

4707
02:21:18,910 --> 02:21:19,350
There's two.

4708
02:21:19,410 --> 02:21:19,890
There's two there.

4709
02:21:20,110 --> 02:21:20,690
Oh, they're both there.

4710
02:21:20,730 --> 02:21:21,090
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4711
02:21:21,110 --> 02:21:21,690
They're both there.

4712
02:21:23,430 --> 02:21:23,750
I'm...

4713
02:21:23,750 --> 02:21:24,090
Oh, nice!

4714
02:21:24,330 --> 02:21:24,510
Oh!

4715
02:21:24,890 --> 02:21:25,430
That's close!

4716
02:21:27,030 --> 02:21:27,670
I think...

4717
02:21:27,670 --> 02:21:28,110
Oh!

4718
02:21:28,510 --> 02:21:29,850
You just needed...

4719
02:21:31,250 --> 02:21:32,510
I think you hit...

4720
02:21:32,510 --> 02:21:32,870
Oh, wait, no.

4721
02:21:33,430 --> 02:21:34,710
I actually can't tell which one I killed.

4722
02:21:35,270 --> 02:21:37,010
Or which one I did damage to.

4723
02:21:38,550 --> 02:21:39,630
Oh, I killed Kevin.

4724
02:21:39,890 --> 02:21:40,490
Oh, you killed Kevin?

4725
02:21:40,610 --> 02:21:41,930
Oh, you just needed, like, one...

4726
02:21:41,930 --> 02:21:42,090
Yeah.

4727
02:21:42,210 --> 02:21:43,510
I killed 37 on him.

4728
02:21:43,850 --> 02:21:44,550
On the other guy.

4729
02:21:44,970 --> 02:21:45,170
Okay.

4730
02:21:45,750 --> 02:21:46,110
Are you...

4731
02:21:46,110 --> 02:21:48,310
You can keep watching here, or you can stand there, too.

4732
02:21:48,410 --> 02:21:48,430
Okay.

4733
02:21:48,430 --> 02:21:49,150
That might be good.

4734
02:21:49,230 --> 02:21:50,130
Yeah, I think I'll stand here.

4735
02:21:54,580 --> 02:21:55,800
I hear one pushing mid.

4736
02:21:56,720 --> 02:21:57,300
I can head over.

4737
02:21:58,280 --> 02:22:00,780
I think they always, like, do two at the same time.

4738
02:22:01,980 --> 02:22:02,500
Oh, okay.

4739
02:22:02,500 --> 02:22:02,520
Okay.

4740
02:22:04,580 --> 02:22:05,760
I don't think they ever split.

4741
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:09,300
And then they're gonna split now.

4742
02:22:10,160 --> 02:22:11,480
Yeah, that's what I was just thinking.

4743
02:22:11,780 --> 02:22:12,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4744
02:22:12,120 --> 02:22:13,580
Watch them actually split.

4745
02:22:17,510 --> 02:22:18,970
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

4746
02:22:20,790 --> 02:22:21,770
We're playing social.

4747
02:22:21,850 --> 02:22:22,170
I hear one here.

4748
02:22:23,490 --> 02:22:24,090
Can I come over?

4749
02:22:25,670 --> 02:22:26,210
Another one?

4750
02:22:26,370 --> 02:22:26,810
He's far.

4751
02:22:27,630 --> 02:22:28,130
Yeah, I'm here.

4752
02:22:30,190 --> 02:22:30,870
Pushed up.

4753
02:22:31,030 --> 02:22:31,150
Pushed up.

4754
02:22:31,150 --> 02:22:31,190
Pushed up.

4755
02:22:31,190 --> 02:22:31,370
I got him.

4756
02:22:31,430 --> 02:22:31,710
I got him.

4757
02:22:31,730 --> 02:22:31,830
I got him.

4758
02:22:31,830 --> 02:22:31,990
Yeah!

4759
02:22:32,610 --> 02:22:33,270
That's right, bitch!

4760
02:22:34,650 --> 02:22:35,470
That's right!

4761
02:22:36,250 --> 02:22:38,070
Fuck you, Kevin!

4762
02:22:39,910 --> 02:22:41,750
Okay, now he's definitely gonna hate me.

4763
02:22:42,210 --> 02:22:42,750
Now...

4764
02:22:43,870 --> 02:22:46,050
Now it's personal for him.

4765
02:22:49,010 --> 02:22:51,030
Of course, the person with two kills.

4766
02:22:52,630 --> 02:22:55,550
The person with two kills acting like this.

4767
02:23:00,980 --> 02:23:01,740
Oh, whoa.

4768
02:23:02,140 --> 02:23:03,060
Alright, we'll do the same thing.

4769
02:23:03,360 --> 02:23:03,700
Okay.

4770
02:23:13,580 --> 02:23:14,840
Oh yeah, there's one here.

4771
02:23:20,700 --> 02:23:23,360
They have to push up pretty far to get to site, so...

4772
02:23:23,360 --> 02:23:23,600
Yeah.

4773
02:23:28,780 --> 02:23:29,740
Oh, they're boosting.

4774
02:23:32,520 --> 02:23:33,680
That one's close.

4775
02:23:33,940 --> 02:23:36,040
He can come from here, so watch your...

4776
02:23:36,040 --> 02:23:36,340
Okay.

4777
02:23:36,680 --> 02:23:37,300
...that area.

4778
02:23:37,460 --> 02:23:38,020
Oh yeah, he did.

4779
02:23:38,360 --> 02:23:39,580
Aww, he did.

4780
02:23:41,160 --> 02:23:41,840
Nice, though.

4781
02:23:45,340 --> 02:23:47,220
The moment you said that you pushed up.

4782
02:23:52,430 --> 02:23:53,770
That was sneaky, sneaky.

4783
02:24:09,240 --> 02:24:10,160
Clutch your cake.

4784
02:24:13,200 --> 02:24:13,760
Oh!

4785
02:24:15,520 --> 02:24:16,980
Okay, that was good.

4786
02:24:17,860 --> 02:24:18,320
Oh!

4787
02:24:19,180 --> 02:24:20,060
You got it!

4788
02:24:20,120 --> 02:24:20,840
You clutched!

4789
02:24:20,940 --> 02:24:22,380
I was gonna report you if you didn't.

4790
02:24:23,180 --> 02:24:24,400
Do you want this gun?

4791
02:24:24,480 --> 02:24:24,720
Oh yeah.

4792
02:24:25,100 --> 02:24:25,540
Or...

4793
02:24:25,540 --> 02:24:26,040
Yeah, yeah.

4794
02:24:27,320 --> 02:24:28,220
What is that?

4795
02:24:28,360 --> 02:24:29,040
The Galeel.

4796
02:24:30,020 --> 02:24:30,620
They are.

4797
02:24:30,620 --> 02:24:32,000
I don't think I'm getting enough gun here on this map.

4798
02:24:32,440 --> 02:24:33,060
It's kinda 30.

4799
02:24:33,660 --> 02:24:33,880
Yeah.

4800
02:24:36,620 --> 02:24:37,020
Alright.

4801
02:24:40,640 --> 02:24:41,920
I think I hear the mid.

4802
02:24:43,800 --> 02:24:45,520
Oh look, we're just a little longer.

4803
02:24:50,330 --> 02:24:51,330
Oh, I hear it.

4804
02:24:51,450 --> 02:24:52,010
Oh, they're not here.

4805
02:24:52,210 --> 02:24:53,310
I think they're boosting again.

4806
02:24:54,110 --> 02:24:54,470
And...

4807
02:24:54,470 --> 02:24:55,570
One of them is.

4808
02:25:00,850 --> 02:25:02,290
I'm scared that the other guy was...

4809
02:25:02,290 --> 02:25:02,970
Have you heard the other one?

4810
02:25:03,330 --> 02:25:03,890
I don't know.

4811
02:25:06,070 --> 02:25:06,430
Aww!

4812
02:25:07,650 --> 02:25:08,690
He was over there.

4813
02:25:08,890 --> 02:25:09,750
I don't know if I hit him.

4814
02:25:10,590 --> 02:25:11,890
I thought he was gonna go around.

4815
02:25:17,920 --> 02:25:19,340
Was he like, up there?

4816
02:25:19,520 --> 02:25:19,620
Oh.

4817
02:25:19,800 --> 02:25:20,240
Yeah, there he is.

4818
02:25:20,240 --> 02:25:20,700
I knew it.

4819
02:25:46,070 --> 02:25:46,590
Aww.

4820
02:25:47,250 --> 02:25:47,770
Nice!

4821
02:25:48,610 --> 02:25:49,590
Oh my god.

4822
02:25:49,670 --> 02:25:50,310
So dirty.

4823
02:25:52,430 --> 02:25:53,730
Wait, what gun is yours?

4824
02:25:53,970 --> 02:25:56,250
The shotgun on this map is infuriating.

4825
02:25:56,430 --> 02:25:57,310
That's crazy.

4826
02:25:57,850 --> 02:25:58,390
The XM.

4827
02:25:58,470 --> 02:25:59,070
The auto-shotting.

4828
02:25:59,270 --> 02:26:00,370
XM-10...

4829
02:26:00,750 --> 02:26:01,010
1014?

4830
02:26:01,210 --> 02:26:02,390
Alright, I'm trying it too.

4831
02:26:02,750 --> 02:26:03,270
Alright.

4832
02:26:04,910 --> 02:26:05,770
Yeah, yeah.

4833
02:26:05,950 --> 02:26:06,230
Okay.

4834
02:26:06,230 --> 02:26:08,130
They both move in so fast.

4835
02:26:08,990 --> 02:26:11,710
You might want to hold a little bit closer though.

4836
02:26:12,850 --> 02:26:13,170
Okay.

4837
02:26:16,250 --> 02:26:18,190
Oh, you can spam that shotgun.

4838
02:26:18,590 --> 02:26:18,890
It's nice.

4839
02:26:19,110 --> 02:26:20,270
You just hold it or do you click?

4840
02:26:23,530 --> 02:26:24,710
Uh, I click.

4841
02:26:25,110 --> 02:26:25,230
Oh yeah.

4842
02:26:25,390 --> 02:26:26,450
I'm not sure if you can hold it.

4843
02:26:26,610 --> 02:26:26,870
Chat.

4844
02:26:27,210 --> 02:26:27,650
You guys though.

4845
02:26:28,210 --> 02:26:28,910
There's one.

4846
02:26:29,510 --> 02:26:30,150
Over here.

4847
02:26:32,550 --> 02:26:33,030
Oh.

4848
02:26:34,710 --> 02:26:35,190
Aww.

4849
02:26:35,710 --> 02:26:36,730
I thought both of...

4850
02:26:36,730 --> 02:26:37,470
I peeked out.

4851
02:26:37,670 --> 02:26:39,030
Because I thought both of them went to you.

4852
02:26:42,230 --> 02:26:42,630
No.

4853
02:26:42,970 --> 02:26:43,930
I got timed.

4854
02:26:57,680 --> 02:26:58,560
Oh, nice!

4855
02:26:59,700 --> 02:27:00,440
Oh, yeah.

4856
02:27:00,560 --> 02:27:01,220
It hit 51.

4857
02:27:01,560 --> 02:27:02,400
So he was ready.

4858
02:27:02,820 --> 02:27:03,140
Yay!

4859
02:27:05,180 --> 02:27:05,980
Oh, nice.

4860
02:27:06,100 --> 02:27:06,720
Yeah, he was lit.

4861
02:27:07,260 --> 02:27:07,520
Nice.

4862
02:27:07,520 --> 02:27:07,940
Do you want an AK?

4863
02:27:08,280 --> 02:27:09,920
No, I'm gonna do what you do.

4864
02:27:10,100 --> 02:27:10,680
Oh, I think you did.

4865
02:27:11,840 --> 02:27:12,280
Okay.

4866
02:27:12,660 --> 02:27:14,320
I'm gonna abuse it too.

4867
02:27:15,680 --> 02:27:16,080
Alright.

4868
02:27:16,080 --> 02:27:17,020
Just go this way.

4869
02:27:19,200 --> 02:27:22,380
I think this is like one of the only maps where it really works.

4870
02:27:23,920 --> 02:27:24,540
That's right.

4871
02:27:24,640 --> 02:27:26,760
It's my turn to abuse this gun.

4872
02:27:28,540 --> 02:27:29,580
And still die.

4873
02:27:46,380 --> 02:27:47,440
This is so slow.

4874
02:27:49,240 --> 02:27:49,660
Yeah.

4875
02:27:50,140 --> 02:27:52,500
They're playing sneaky because we're kind of catching up.

4876
02:27:53,440 --> 02:27:54,180
My god.

4877
02:27:55,200 --> 02:27:55,620
Oh.

4878
02:27:55,980 --> 02:27:56,360
Well, yeah.

4879
02:27:56,380 --> 02:27:57,080
There's one on A.

4880
02:27:57,200 --> 02:27:57,600
Both on A.

4881
02:27:57,680 --> 02:27:57,960
Both there.

4882
02:27:58,020 --> 02:27:58,280
One A?

4883
02:27:58,360 --> 02:27:58,560
Okay.

4884
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:00,440
Yeah.

4885
02:28:00,560 --> 02:28:01,580
It'll be to your left.

4886
02:28:05,720 --> 02:28:06,160
Aww.

4887
02:28:07,760 --> 02:28:08,800
Nice try, nice try.

4888
02:28:09,040 --> 02:28:09,120
Yeah.

4889
02:28:09,900 --> 02:28:10,920
F46 though.

4890
02:28:13,040 --> 02:28:14,220
It's always Kevin.

4891
02:28:14,460 --> 02:28:15,460
It's always Kevin.

4892
02:28:15,900 --> 02:28:16,100
God.

4893
02:28:16,360 --> 02:28:17,080
Damn it.

4894
02:28:17,360 --> 02:28:17,780
I...

4895
02:28:18,740 --> 02:28:19,540
That's it.

4896
02:28:20,060 --> 02:28:21,540
I'm throwing grenades.

4897
02:28:22,100 --> 02:28:24,700
You'll probably do the same thing, I think.

4898
02:28:26,160 --> 02:28:28,760
I'll try to smoke him off on the ramp over here.

4899
02:28:28,780 --> 02:28:29,180
I fucked up.

4900
02:28:30,860 --> 02:28:32,200
Did you hurt yourself?

4901
02:28:32,380 --> 02:28:33,320
No, I did.

4902
02:28:33,900 --> 02:28:35,240
I didn't know how to name.

4903
02:28:39,560 --> 02:28:40,440
You want me to come over?

4904
02:28:42,160 --> 02:28:42,920
Fire in the hole.

4905
02:28:43,420 --> 02:28:44,120
Uh, nah.

4906
02:28:44,260 --> 02:28:45,260
I'm just spamming nades.

4907
02:28:45,420 --> 02:28:45,980
Throwing fire.

4908
02:28:48,180 --> 02:28:48,580
Oh!

4909
02:28:49,060 --> 02:28:49,800
They boosted.

4910
02:28:49,820 --> 02:28:50,300
It's two, it's two.

4911
02:28:50,360 --> 02:28:51,060
They boosted up there.

4912
02:28:51,340 --> 02:28:53,340
But I don't know if the other one will start flanking.

4913
02:28:57,180 --> 02:28:57,580
Oh!

4914
02:28:58,540 --> 02:28:59,380
That was good.

4915
02:28:59,380 --> 02:28:59,880
So close!

4916
02:29:00,100 --> 02:29:00,540
6-9!

4917
02:29:00,900 --> 02:29:00,920
That was close.

4918
02:29:01,180 --> 02:29:01,380
Yeah.

4919
02:29:01,640 --> 02:29:02,040
Nice.

4920
02:29:03,540 --> 02:29:04,820
The clickbait.

4921
02:29:05,300 --> 02:29:06,320
Oh my god.

4922
02:29:12,900 --> 02:29:14,340
Yeah, they boosted.

4923
02:29:14,640 --> 02:29:15,200
Yeah.

4924
02:29:15,200 --> 02:29:15,660
For that.

4925
02:29:15,900 --> 02:29:16,760
That's fun though.

4926
02:29:17,400 --> 02:29:18,060
That's fun.

4927
02:29:18,200 --> 02:29:19,000
Learning CS.

4928
02:29:20,140 --> 02:29:20,440
Yeah.

4929
02:29:20,980 --> 02:29:22,580
You wanna do Overwatch Stadium now?

4930
02:29:22,860 --> 02:29:23,200
Yeah.

4931
02:29:23,520 --> 02:29:23,620
Yeah.

4932
02:29:24,140 --> 02:29:24,540
Okay.

4933
02:29:24,900 --> 02:29:25,120
Yeah.

4934
02:29:25,600 --> 02:29:27,920
Do you think he would play?

4935
02:29:28,380 --> 02:29:29,620
I would, yeah.

4936
02:29:30,700 --> 02:29:32,020
Do you think he would play CS again?

4937
02:29:32,020 --> 02:29:33,560
I would play with people for sure.

4938
02:29:33,680 --> 02:29:34,760
I don't think I can do the solo.

4939
02:29:35,080 --> 02:29:37,220
I, I think I'd get too mad.

4940
02:29:37,320 --> 02:29:37,540
Yeah.

4941
02:29:37,760 --> 02:29:39,140
If I play CS solo.

4942
02:29:39,740 --> 02:29:39,880
Yeah.

4943
02:29:39,940 --> 02:29:40,980
I feel like, I need to play.

4944
02:29:41,320 --> 02:29:42,060
It is really infuriating.

4945
02:29:42,320 --> 02:29:42,480
Yeah.

4946
02:29:42,640 --> 02:29:44,740
As long as all I have to do is just shoot.

4947
02:29:45,060 --> 02:29:47,460
Then like, and never use my util, I'll be fine.

4948
02:29:47,860 --> 02:29:47,940
Alright.

4949
02:29:50,280 --> 02:29:51,560
I'll let other people.

4950
02:29:51,580 --> 02:29:52,800
It's just like, abilities.

4951
02:29:53,140 --> 02:29:53,560
How's that?

4952
02:29:53,560 --> 02:29:55,360
No, it's so different.

4953
02:29:55,900 --> 02:29:56,000
Alright.

4954
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:57,180
I think it's the lineup.

4955
02:29:57,460 --> 02:29:59,320
Lining it up is like, weird.

4956
02:29:59,560 --> 02:30:00,180
I think.

4957
02:30:01,280 --> 02:30:04,540
I just don't like, it's just, I'm so bad with deaf perception.

4958
02:30:04,680 --> 02:30:05,220
Did you see this?

4959
02:30:05,360 --> 02:30:05,500
Okay.

4960
02:30:05,680 --> 02:30:06,700
So, I don't know if you saw.

4961
02:30:06,780 --> 02:30:11,640
I tweeted out, um, a video of me playing Jeff.

4962
02:30:11,640 --> 02:30:19,280
I don't know if you saw, but I have very, I have very bad deaf perception.

4963
02:30:19,280 --> 02:30:19,980
Did you jump off?

4964
02:30:21,520 --> 02:30:21,760
No.

4965
02:30:22,020 --> 02:30:22,680
The thing is.

4966
02:30:23,440 --> 02:30:24,540
I'll show you the clip.

4967
02:30:24,720 --> 02:30:25,880
I'll show my chat the clip too.

4968
02:30:26,320 --> 02:30:31,520
So, the thing is, is that, I literally saw Captain America made it.

4969
02:30:31,520 --> 02:30:36,120
So, I was like, clearly I can make it too.

4970
02:30:37,820 --> 02:30:38,340
Like...

4971
02:30:39,280 --> 02:30:42,240
I was like, I saw him, he walked over.

4972
02:30:42,500 --> 02:30:45,180
And then I was like, surely I can walk over that.

4973
02:30:45,640 --> 02:30:47,420
And then I just fell straight down.

4974
02:30:47,640 --> 02:30:49,080
I fell all the way down.

4975
02:30:50,460 --> 02:30:52,680
And then my team was like, what happened to Jeff?

4976
02:30:52,680 --> 02:30:53,900
He had four legs.

4977
02:30:54,200 --> 02:30:57,840
So, it's more difficult for him to, you know, jump like that.

4978
02:30:57,860 --> 02:30:59,700
Yeah, to be fair, I was just, I was waddling.

4979
02:30:59,920 --> 02:31:02,500
I was, I was just waddling up.

4980
02:31:03,360 --> 02:31:05,680
To the, to the hole, the big hole.

4981
02:31:07,660 --> 02:31:09,220
Do you play Jeff that often?

4982
02:31:09,600 --> 02:31:12,980
No, it was just, that, that was the one time I played Jeff too.

4983
02:31:13,300 --> 02:31:16,440
That one time I decided to play Jeff yesterday.

4984
02:31:18,940 --> 02:31:22,100
Oh, cause Captain America has like, the momentum from...

4985
02:31:22,100 --> 02:31:23,920
Yeah, I forgot he could run.

4986
02:31:24,440 --> 02:31:25,400
I forgot he could run.

4987
02:31:25,400 --> 02:31:26,180
Run, yeah, yeah.

4988
02:31:26,720 --> 02:31:28,760
Yeah, Jeff is just waddling.

4989
02:31:29,980 --> 02:31:30,380
Alright.

4990
02:31:30,880 --> 02:31:31,580
I think...

4991
02:31:31,580 --> 02:31:32,800
I'm gonna send you my, uh...

4992
02:31:32,800 --> 02:31:33,060
Oh yeah.

4993
02:31:33,320 --> 02:31:33,580
Tag.

4994
02:31:34,060 --> 02:31:34,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4995
02:31:34,900 --> 02:31:35,720
No leaks, guys.

4996
02:31:36,020 --> 02:31:36,520
No leaks.

4997
02:31:39,100 --> 02:31:40,340
Oh my god.

4998
02:31:40,540 --> 02:31:43,140
Someone already made Hank Hill dance a Miku song.

4999
02:31:46,440 --> 02:31:49,640
Wait, it's like two days or...

5000
02:31:49,640 --> 02:31:51,340
I love, god, I love Fortnite.

5001
02:31:51,760 --> 02:31:52,980
I love Fortnite skins.

5002
02:31:54,400 --> 02:31:55,220
Alright, uh...

5003
02:31:55,220 --> 02:31:56,380
You don't even play it?

5004
02:31:56,480 --> 02:31:56,860
You just like...

5005
02:31:56,860 --> 02:31:58,760
Yeah, I literally, I just buy...

5006
02:31:58,760 --> 02:32:02,140
I just log into Fortnite, buy the skin, and then log off.

5007
02:32:03,220 --> 02:32:03,780
Like...

5008
02:32:04,340 --> 02:32:05,700
Wait, is that your name?

5009
02:32:06,220 --> 02:32:07,200
Is that...

5010
02:32:07,200 --> 02:32:08,100
Is that...

5011
02:32:08,100 --> 02:32:08,140
Yes.

5012
02:32:08,140 --> 02:32:09,040
Is that...

5013
02:32:09,040 --> 02:32:09,580
Okay.

5014
02:32:10,340 --> 02:32:11,060
Wait, does your...

5015
02:32:11,700 --> 02:32:12,260
I...

5016
02:32:12,260 --> 02:32:13,660
It's an old name.

5017
02:32:14,080 --> 02:32:14,360
Yeah.

5018
02:32:14,360 --> 02:32:14,740
Uh...

5019
02:32:14,740 --> 02:32:18,520
Like, I wanted to change it, but it costs like $10 to change your name, and...

5020
02:32:19,180 --> 02:32:19,840
I just...

5021
02:32:19,840 --> 02:32:20,280
I don't know.

5022
02:32:20,860 --> 02:32:21,960
It's a good name, though.

5023
02:32:21,960 --> 02:32:23,620
Do I really wanna give Blizzard $10?

5024
02:32:24,120 --> 02:32:24,680
That's true.

5025
02:32:24,920 --> 02:32:25,480
That's true.

5026
02:32:25,840 --> 02:32:26,160
Thank you.

5027
02:32:26,160 --> 02:32:27,700
They don't need more of our money.

5028
02:32:28,460 --> 02:32:29,500
Alright, I added you.

5029
02:32:32,760 --> 02:32:33,200
Slash.

5030
02:32:33,380 --> 02:32:33,660
Okay.

5031
02:32:34,320 --> 02:32:35,100
Oh wait, hold on.

5032
02:32:35,160 --> 02:32:35,960
It says...

5033
02:32:35,960 --> 02:32:39,360
Overwatch has detected your computers using Intel 13th or 14th gen processor.

5034
02:32:39,800 --> 02:32:40,240
Oh.

5035
02:32:40,620 --> 02:32:41,060
Hmm...

5036
02:32:41,060 --> 02:32:42,200
I don't know if that's good or not.

5037
02:32:42,200 --> 02:32:44,420
It's fine if I do the Intel fine-tuning thing.

5038
02:32:44,880 --> 02:32:45,220
Hmm?

5039
02:32:45,220 --> 02:32:46,020
No, it's like that...

5040
02:32:46,020 --> 02:32:47,040
I have the...

5041
02:32:47,480 --> 02:32:49,280
The shoddy processor, the...

5042
02:32:49,280 --> 02:32:50,300
Oh, the one that's...

5043
02:32:50,300 --> 02:32:50,580
The 10th gen...

5044
02:32:50,580 --> 02:32:52,500
Yeah, the one that has...

5045
02:32:52,900 --> 02:32:53,280
Problems.

5046
02:32:54,020 --> 02:32:54,040
Or I-9.

5047
02:32:54,740 --> 02:32:55,120
Yeah.

5048
02:32:55,300 --> 02:32:56,100
Yeah, the problems.

5049
02:32:56,360 --> 02:32:57,640
But it's still launched, so I...

5050
02:32:57,640 --> 02:32:59,120
It's probably fine.

5051
02:33:01,240 --> 02:33:02,290
Okay, I'm gonna go...

5052
02:33:03,440 --> 02:33:04,300
I'll go...

5053
02:33:04,300 --> 02:33:05,000
Do you wanna play tank?

5054
02:33:05,220 --> 02:33:06,680
Cause there's a role queue for stadium.

5055
02:33:06,920 --> 02:33:08,400
Are you gonna go tank, damage, or support?

5056
02:33:10,720 --> 02:33:11,220
Uh...

5057
02:33:12,520 --> 02:33:13,020
Um...

5058
02:33:13,020 --> 02:33:13,800
Hold on...

5059
02:33:16,580 --> 02:33:17,080
Um...

5060
02:33:17,080 --> 02:33:18,440
Yeah, that's here.

5061
02:33:18,900 --> 02:33:19,720
Do you usually go tank?

5062
02:33:19,960 --> 02:33:21,860
No, I usually go support, but like...

5063
02:33:21,860 --> 02:33:25,450
I also am currently elite support, so maybe I should go...

5064
02:33:27,580 --> 02:33:28,080
Oh...

5065
02:33:28,080 --> 02:33:30,940
Yeah, I didn't play that much, but...

5066
02:33:32,140 --> 02:33:32,660
Uh...

5067
02:33:33,840 --> 02:33:34,360
No...

5068
02:33:34,800 --> 02:33:35,440
Question mark!

5069
02:33:37,520 --> 02:33:39,520
Question mark, I have no idea.

5070
02:33:40,660 --> 02:33:41,180
Well, is there...

5071
02:33:41,180 --> 02:33:42,760
Like, a matchmaking rank?

5072
02:33:42,860 --> 02:33:44,200
Apparently, any...

5073
02:33:44,200 --> 02:33:44,680
Anything in this?

5074
02:33:44,820 --> 02:33:47,060
Apparently, you can play...

5075
02:33:47,060 --> 02:33:48,700
No, like, it doesn't matter what your rank are.

5076
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:49,340
Is...

5077
02:33:49,340 --> 02:33:52,220
You can grow up with anybody, and they'll just balance it out through it.

5078
02:33:52,460 --> 02:33:52,680
Oh...

5079
02:33:52,680 --> 02:33:53,560
But everybody...

5080
02:33:53,560 --> 02:33:54,840
It's like, you know how like...

5081
02:33:54,840 --> 02:33:58,360
In Rivals and Apex, there's no placements for your stadium?

5082
02:33:58,820 --> 02:34:01,400
So like, you start for all the way from bronze.

5083
02:34:01,960 --> 02:34:02,400
Yeah.

5084
02:34:04,740 --> 02:34:05,180
Oh...

5085
02:34:05,180 --> 02:34:05,320
Yeah.

5086
02:34:05,660 --> 02:34:05,980
Okay, gotcha.

5087
02:34:05,980 --> 02:34:07,680
So it's just grinding the game...

5088
02:34:07,680 --> 02:34:09,160
To get a higher rank.

5089
02:34:09,980 --> 02:34:12,580
And then they have like, win streaks and stuff, so you can...

5090
02:34:12,580 --> 02:34:13,180
Oh...

5091
02:34:13,180 --> 02:34:13,880
Get...

5092
02:34:13,880 --> 02:34:15,560
Get like, points easily.

5093
02:34:15,960 --> 02:34:17,560
So, I need to back you all right back!

5094
02:34:19,100 --> 02:34:19,540
Okay!

5095
02:34:22,660 --> 02:34:26,000
Now I will steal and take over Doki's chat.

5096
02:34:27,140 --> 02:34:27,860
Look at me!

5097
02:34:28,540 --> 02:34:29,220
Look at me!

5098
02:34:30,680 --> 02:34:31,940
I'm Doki now.

5099
02:34:32,760 --> 02:34:33,580
How do I get out of this?

5100
02:34:36,340 --> 02:34:36,740
Um...

5101
02:34:36,740 --> 02:34:37,180
Oh!

5102
02:34:37,340 --> 02:34:37,960
There's a new hero.

5103
02:34:43,480 --> 02:34:44,760
This hero looks...

5104
02:34:44,760 --> 02:34:48,220
There's like a character in Paladins that looks very similar to this.

5105
02:34:48,360 --> 02:34:49,220
I think her name's Cassie.

5106
02:34:49,300 --> 02:34:50,060
Or no, there's another one.

5107
02:34:50,140 --> 02:34:50,840
She has red hair.

5108
02:34:51,020 --> 02:34:52,020
And she has a crossbow.

5109
02:34:53,860 --> 02:34:54,440
No...

5110
02:34:55,720 --> 02:34:56,300
Uh...

5111
02:34:56,300 --> 02:34:56,860
Okay.

5112
02:34:58,200 --> 02:34:58,780
Okay.

5113
02:34:59,680 --> 02:35:00,540
Oh, cute!

5114
02:35:04,960 --> 02:35:07,300
I haven't played Overwatch in so long.

5115
02:35:07,300 --> 02:35:10,500
I haven't launched this in like, two years or something.

5116
02:35:10,800 --> 02:35:11,560
It feels like.

5117
02:35:13,060 --> 02:35:19,440
Yes, my name... on this account... is, uh...

5118
02:35:19,440 --> 02:35:20,120
Don't worry about it.

5119
02:35:20,660 --> 02:35:22,000
Oh, yeah, don't worry about it.

5120
02:35:25,120 --> 02:35:29,040
I was thinking about making it Duba instead.

5121
02:35:29,520 --> 02:35:29,580
Yeah.

5122
02:35:29,760 --> 02:35:33,400
But I'm not gonna spend $10 to change one letter.

5123
02:35:33,960 --> 02:35:34,820
So true.

5124
02:35:35,420 --> 02:35:36,080
So true.

5125
02:35:36,200 --> 02:35:37,420
They already make enough money.

5126
02:35:38,120 --> 02:35:38,680
Alright.

5127
02:35:39,380 --> 02:35:40,400
Invite the group.

5128
02:35:40,560 --> 02:35:41,460
I invited you.

5129
02:35:42,440 --> 02:35:42,840
Alright.

5130
02:35:43,600 --> 02:35:44,000
Stadium.

5131
02:35:45,520 --> 02:35:47,780
Alright, I could do...

5132
02:35:47,780 --> 02:35:49,780
Is this six or... No, it's five people.

5133
02:35:49,920 --> 02:35:50,060
Okay.

5134
02:35:50,400 --> 02:35:51,140
I can do damage.

5135
02:35:52,400 --> 02:35:53,120
Oh, okay.

5136
02:35:53,420 --> 02:35:53,660
Yeah.

5137
02:35:54,120 --> 02:35:56,400
I'll do... I'll just do all, so I'll just...

5138
02:35:56,400 --> 02:35:57,320
Oh, just flex?

5139
02:35:57,640 --> 02:35:57,840
Yeah.

5140
02:35:58,440 --> 02:36:01,180
Oh, you can fuck around with the builds and stuff, too.

5141
02:36:02,600 --> 02:36:02,940
What?

5142
02:36:03,580 --> 02:36:04,940
I'm gonna take us to deathmash.

5143
02:36:04,960 --> 02:36:06,380
Is it like if you pick one...

5144
02:36:06,380 --> 02:36:07,700
Is this Q support?

5145
02:36:07,940 --> 02:36:08,600
So if you get put into...

5146
02:36:08,600 --> 02:36:09,640
Or Q role?

5147
02:36:09,760 --> 02:36:11,820
So if you get put into support, like you're stuck in support?

5148
02:36:12,480 --> 02:36:14,080
It's a normal rank system.

5149
02:36:14,560 --> 02:36:14,680
Yeah.

5150
02:36:15,640 --> 02:36:17,000
I don't know the...

5151
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:18,900
I don't know the DPS loadout, though.

5152
02:36:19,080 --> 02:36:21,960
Like the DPS stuff you can do for the builds.

5153
02:36:22,360 --> 02:36:25,560
And people already put out guides on like what build to do and stuff.

5154
02:36:27,340 --> 02:36:28,220
I heard...

5155
02:36:28,220 --> 02:36:28,540
Oh, okay.

5156
02:36:28,740 --> 02:36:30,560
Wait, so is this kind of new then?

5157
02:36:30,860 --> 02:36:32,140
Um, it came out...

5158
02:36:32,140 --> 02:36:32,620
Oh, my God.

5159
02:36:32,860 --> 02:36:33,520
Oh, my God.

5160
02:36:33,680 --> 02:36:33,900
I...

5161
02:36:33,900 --> 02:36:35,540
My aim is so bad right now.

5162
02:36:37,940 --> 02:36:38,600
What do you mean?

5163
02:36:38,880 --> 02:36:40,020
We won the boot counterstrike.

5164
02:36:40,100 --> 02:36:41,240
That's like the perfect aim.

5165
02:36:41,240 --> 02:36:41,600
No.

5166
02:36:42,440 --> 02:36:42,640
Wait.

5167
02:36:42,900 --> 02:36:43,260
Oh, wait.

5168
02:36:43,540 --> 02:36:44,080
My sense.

5169
02:36:44,480 --> 02:36:45,820
Oh, my God.

5170
02:36:46,120 --> 02:36:46,720
What the fuck?

5171
02:36:47,240 --> 02:36:50,240
I forgot my support sense is like customized.

5172
02:36:50,720 --> 02:36:51,600
And then...

5173
02:36:51,600 --> 02:36:52,280
Wait.

5174
02:36:52,500 --> 02:36:53,640
That's not my right sense?

5175
02:36:53,640 --> 02:36:54,800
Why is that...

5176
02:36:54,800 --> 02:36:55,920
Is it my right sense?

5177
02:36:56,060 --> 02:36:56,800
I don't remember.

5178
02:36:58,260 --> 02:37:00,200
Oh, it's a lot of movement stuff.

5179
02:37:01,440 --> 02:37:03,560
Guys, can someone check my VOD?

5180
02:37:03,720 --> 02:37:04,900
My Overwatch VODs?

5181
02:37:04,960 --> 02:37:06,560
And tell me what my sense is in Overwatch?

5182
02:37:06,820 --> 02:37:07,560
Cause I don't remember.

5183
02:37:08,100 --> 02:37:08,400
I...

5184
02:37:08,400 --> 02:37:10,100
I actually...

5185
02:37:10,620 --> 02:37:11,700
That sounds like a lot of work.

5186
02:37:13,860 --> 02:37:15,180
I don't remember.

5187
02:37:16,660 --> 02:37:18,320
I don't know if I like D...

5188
02:37:18,320 --> 02:37:20,300
If my sense is fucked up or not.

5189
02:37:23,620 --> 02:37:24,020
It's...

5190
02:37:24,020 --> 02:37:24,660
It's...

5191
02:37:25,180 --> 02:37:25,880
There's no way.

5192
02:37:26,180 --> 02:37:26,820
There's no way.

5193
02:37:27,080 --> 02:37:28,080
There's no way.

5194
02:37:28,180 --> 02:37:28,940
That timestamp stuff.

5195
02:37:29,520 --> 02:37:30,100
Oh, yeah.

5196
02:37:30,180 --> 02:37:30,300
Yeah.

5197
02:37:30,380 --> 02:37:30,700
They do.

5198
02:37:30,860 --> 02:37:30,940
Yeah.

5199
02:37:31,020 --> 02:37:31,100
No.

5200
02:37:31,140 --> 02:37:32,460
I just have it on my description.

5201
02:37:32,820 --> 02:37:34,400
Like what my sense is.

5202
02:37:35,060 --> 02:37:36,020
Oh, it is four.

5203
02:37:36,600 --> 02:37:36,760
No.

5204
02:37:36,860 --> 02:37:38,520
1.83 is my rival.

5205
02:37:39,320 --> 02:37:39,440
Okay.

5206
02:37:40,380 --> 02:37:41,180
It is four.

5207
02:37:41,300 --> 02:37:43,300
I'm just not used to first person anymore.

5208
02:37:43,940 --> 02:37:44,160
All right.

5209
02:37:44,460 --> 02:37:45,500
Oh, we're both DPS.

5210
02:37:45,720 --> 02:37:45,880
Okay.

5211
02:37:46,440 --> 02:37:46,840
Nice.

5212
02:37:47,800 --> 02:37:48,240
Uh...

5213
02:37:48,240 --> 02:37:49,500
I don't know what's meta.

5214
02:37:50,900 --> 02:37:51,340
It's...

5215
02:37:51,340 --> 02:37:53,060
Oh, do they rotate characters out for this?

5216
02:37:53,300 --> 02:37:53,680
No.

5217
02:37:53,960 --> 02:37:54,500
It's just...

5218
02:37:54,500 --> 02:37:55,360
It's always this.

5219
02:37:55,780 --> 02:37:56,040
Yeah.

5220
02:37:56,800 --> 02:37:57,760
I heard Freya.

5221
02:37:57,940 --> 02:37:59,780
Oh, Freya is really good right now.

5222
02:38:01,240 --> 02:38:01,680
Uh...

5223
02:38:01,680 --> 02:38:01,900
Okay.

5224
02:38:02,120 --> 02:38:02,540
I'll try.

5225
02:38:03,160 --> 02:38:03,500
Yeah.

5226
02:38:03,700 --> 02:38:04,480
She's like...

5227
02:38:04,480 --> 02:38:07,000
It's like a fast projectile.

5228
02:38:07,320 --> 02:38:07,700
You know what?

5229
02:38:07,700 --> 02:38:08,500
I'll play Call of Duty.

5230
02:38:08,900 --> 02:38:09,340
Um...

5231
02:38:09,340 --> 02:38:09,640
Oh, wait.

5232
02:38:09,680 --> 02:38:10,340
Is Cass meta?

5233
02:38:10,840 --> 02:38:12,080
I'm not gonna hit anything.

5234
02:38:14,040 --> 02:38:15,220
Wait, what's his name again?

5235
02:38:15,220 --> 02:38:15,640
I forgot.

5236
02:38:15,640 --> 02:38:16,500
Cassidy.

5237
02:38:18,360 --> 02:38:18,880
Cass...

5238
02:38:18,880 --> 02:38:19,360
Okay, yeah.

5239
02:38:20,460 --> 02:38:20,980
Okay.

5240
02:38:22,120 --> 02:38:25,020
Wait, is it not in first person?

5241
02:38:25,200 --> 02:38:25,560
Or is it still first person?

5242
02:38:25,560 --> 02:38:25,860
You can...

5243
02:38:25,860 --> 02:38:28,160
You can swap the third person for this one.

5244
02:38:29,500 --> 02:38:29,880
Oh.

5245
02:38:30,500 --> 02:38:32,280
So, that's what makes it unique.

5246
02:38:32,660 --> 02:38:35,700
So, now you can play as, uh...

5247
02:38:35,700 --> 02:38:38,240
You can be like first person or third person.

5248
02:38:38,480 --> 02:38:41,880
But I think it's weird for me to play third person on Overwatch.

5249
02:38:42,660 --> 02:38:42,920
Yeah.

5250
02:38:42,920 --> 02:38:43,360
Yeah.

5251
02:38:43,360 --> 02:38:43,680
Yeah.

5252
02:38:44,320 --> 02:38:45,780
Guys, what's the build for Cass?

5253
02:38:46,640 --> 02:38:48,040
Is it weapon power?

5254
02:38:48,540 --> 02:38:49,000
Yeah.

5255
02:38:49,060 --> 02:38:50,160
What do we do, guys?

5256
02:38:50,560 --> 02:38:51,840
What do we do?

5257
02:38:52,320 --> 02:38:52,600
Oh, yeah.

5258
02:38:52,780 --> 02:38:53,880
I assume weapon power.

5259
02:38:55,620 --> 02:38:56,140
Uh...

5260
02:38:56,140 --> 02:38:57,400
After using combat...

5261
02:38:57,400 --> 02:38:58,920
Guys, what the fuck do I...

5262
02:38:58,920 --> 02:39:00,020
What do I do?

5263
02:39:02,420 --> 02:39:04,240
Weapon power and max ammo?

5264
02:39:04,240 --> 02:39:04,760
Ooh.

5265
02:39:07,600 --> 02:39:08,080
Ooh.

5266
02:39:10,560 --> 02:39:12,000
Oh, there's so many.

5267
02:39:13,120 --> 02:39:14,260
So I only get to pick one?

5268
02:39:14,720 --> 02:39:15,000
Yeah.

5269
02:39:15,240 --> 02:39:15,540
For now.

5270
02:39:15,760 --> 02:39:17,620
Cause it's, uh...

5271
02:39:17,620 --> 02:39:19,480
Ammo and right click funsie?

5272
02:39:19,680 --> 02:39:20,500
But what's it called?

5273
02:39:21,360 --> 02:39:21,960
I don't know.

5274
02:39:25,780 --> 02:39:28,100
Wait, how do I switch into first person?

5275
02:39:28,260 --> 02:39:28,460
Do you know?

5276
02:39:28,500 --> 02:39:29,600
Yeah, there's just settings.

5277
02:39:30,140 --> 02:39:32,260
And then, uh...

5278
02:39:32,260 --> 02:39:32,660
Video...

5279
02:39:32,660 --> 02:39:33,000
I don't know.

5280
02:39:33,080 --> 02:39:33,720
It's like in...

5281
02:39:33,720 --> 02:39:35,020
I think it's video or gameplay.

5282
02:39:36,320 --> 02:39:37,500
Okay, I'll do...

5283
02:39:37,500 --> 02:39:37,720
Okay.

5284
02:39:37,900 --> 02:39:38,200
Oh my god.

5285
02:39:38,380 --> 02:39:38,940
I don't know.

5286
02:39:39,260 --> 02:39:39,660
Ugh.

5287
02:39:40,440 --> 02:39:41,780
I might have got something dumb.

5288
02:39:44,260 --> 02:39:44,660
I...

5289
02:39:44,660 --> 02:39:47,700
I just got flashbang power up.

5290
02:39:50,040 --> 02:39:50,720
I don't know.

5291
02:39:50,900 --> 02:39:52,100
I just clicked the first thing I saw.

5292
02:39:53,340 --> 02:39:53,700
Whoops.

5293
02:39:55,420 --> 02:39:56,640
I didn't have time to look.

5294
02:39:56,740 --> 02:39:57,180
This is fine.

5295
02:39:57,600 --> 02:39:57,960
This is fine.

5296
02:39:58,360 --> 02:39:59,140
This is fine.

5297
02:39:59,500 --> 02:40:01,300
Wait, I'm getting distracted by the mercy skin.

5298
02:40:02,880 --> 02:40:03,240
Oh.

5299
02:40:07,220 --> 02:40:07,580
Alright.

5300
02:40:08,560 --> 02:40:09,820
Oh no, don't damage boost me.

5301
02:40:09,940 --> 02:40:10,800
I don't know what I'm doing.

5302
02:40:11,280 --> 02:40:11,980
Don't do it.

5303
02:40:15,120 --> 02:40:15,840
Oh, nice.

5304
02:40:17,900 --> 02:40:19,260
Nice, our team's doing it.

5305
02:40:19,420 --> 02:40:19,900
Where are they?

5306
02:40:19,900 --> 02:40:21,020
Wait, they're taking high ground?

5307
02:40:23,080 --> 02:40:23,680
I don't know.

5308
02:40:23,780 --> 02:40:24,280
I'm just shooting.

5309
02:40:26,960 --> 02:40:27,380
Ah!

5310
02:40:27,760 --> 02:40:29,940
I forgot they put fall off damage.

5311
02:40:31,080 --> 02:40:31,800
Oh, really?

5312
02:40:32,020 --> 02:40:33,020
Yeah, for Cass, yeah.

5313
02:40:34,260 --> 02:40:34,900
Oh, I see.

5314
02:40:35,880 --> 02:40:37,180
I need to remember that I can...

5315
02:40:38,500 --> 02:40:39,720
I can crush this.

5316
02:40:44,110 --> 02:40:44,530
Slashbang!

5317
02:40:44,530 --> 02:40:45,970
Does respawn, like, normal?

5318
02:40:46,290 --> 02:40:47,090
Like, uh...

5319
02:40:47,090 --> 02:40:47,810
Yeah, yeah, it's normal.

5320
02:40:48,650 --> 02:40:49,070
Timer?

5321
02:40:49,190 --> 02:40:49,550
Oh, okay.

5322
02:40:49,550 --> 02:40:50,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5323
02:40:51,130 --> 02:40:52,630
I hear you, soldier.

5324
02:40:53,450 --> 02:40:54,150
Come on.

5325
02:40:54,570 --> 02:40:56,070
Oh, he ran all the way back.

5326
02:40:56,590 --> 02:40:57,010
Yeah.

5327
02:40:58,430 --> 02:41:01,290
Wait, is this map new for this, uh, game mode?

5328
02:41:01,650 --> 02:41:02,230
Uh, yeah.

5329
02:41:02,530 --> 02:41:03,310
Just for this game mode.

5330
02:41:04,430 --> 02:41:05,970
I don't know where the fuck you position.

5331
02:41:06,250 --> 02:41:07,450
I'm always, like, support for this.

5332
02:41:09,510 --> 02:41:10,050
Oh!

5333
02:41:10,070 --> 02:41:10,450
Oh!

5334
02:41:10,670 --> 02:41:11,210
Oh!

5335
02:41:12,230 --> 02:41:12,770
Oh!

5336
02:41:15,490 --> 02:41:16,630
Oh, he's so low.

5337
02:41:16,790 --> 02:41:17,370
Oh, he's so low.

5338
02:41:18,190 --> 02:41:19,170
I'm using it.

5339
02:41:21,910 --> 02:41:22,450
No!

5340
02:41:23,590 --> 02:41:24,930
He reflected it!

5341
02:41:25,290 --> 02:41:26,190
He's too smart!

5342
02:41:29,190 --> 02:41:29,550
Nice.

5343
02:41:30,670 --> 02:41:32,110
I'm standing below us.

5344
02:41:32,310 --> 02:41:33,150
He can't kill me.

5345
02:41:33,210 --> 02:41:34,010
I'm below him.

5346
02:41:34,230 --> 02:41:35,010
Yeah, me too.

5347
02:41:35,550 --> 02:41:36,350
Oh, never mind.

5348
02:41:36,350 --> 02:41:36,850
I'm asleep.

5349
02:41:38,570 --> 02:41:39,110
Where'd he go?

5350
02:41:39,630 --> 02:41:40,030
I don't know.

5351
02:41:40,050 --> 02:41:40,350
Oh, he's over here.

5352
02:41:41,970 --> 02:41:42,790
That's a good question.

5353
02:41:42,930 --> 02:41:43,950
Wait, what the fuck is he doing?

5354
02:41:44,810 --> 02:41:45,170
Nice.

5355
02:41:46,210 --> 02:41:46,790
He's dead.

5356
02:41:47,030 --> 02:41:48,230
He's dying is what he's doing.

5357
02:41:48,230 --> 02:41:48,910
That's right.

5358
02:41:48,930 --> 02:41:50,450
Get back here, Cassidy!

5359
02:41:50,930 --> 02:41:52,310
Get your ass back here!

5360
02:41:52,690 --> 02:41:53,270
Oh my god!

5361
02:41:53,470 --> 02:41:53,670
Oh my god!

5362
02:41:53,850 --> 02:41:54,110
JK!

5363
02:41:54,330 --> 02:41:54,430
JK!

5364
02:41:55,610 --> 02:41:56,810
Oh no!

5365
02:41:57,150 --> 02:41:58,590
He flashbaked me!

5366
02:41:59,630 --> 02:41:59,970
He flashbaked me!

5367
02:42:00,130 --> 02:42:01,490
He flashbaked me!

5368
02:42:02,310 --> 02:42:03,070
He flashbaked me!

5369
02:42:03,070 --> 02:42:05,230
He knew exactly what he was doing.

5370
02:42:06,030 --> 02:42:11,650
Okay, I'm gonna steal their Cass' build, cause I have no idea what to build.

5371
02:42:12,810 --> 02:42:13,370
Okay.

5372
02:42:14,830 --> 02:42:19,170
No, he was camping, he was playing CS, and I was playing actual Overwatch.

5373
02:42:21,670 --> 02:42:22,970
How dare he!

5374
02:42:23,210 --> 02:42:24,750
You can switch just like that.

5375
02:42:28,100 --> 02:42:31,070
I'm so lucky Cassidy has fall off now.

5376
02:42:32,570 --> 02:42:35,370
I don't know what my I need healing button is.

5377
02:42:37,170 --> 02:42:39,870
The findings for this is like, so different.

5378
02:42:41,090 --> 02:42:41,470
There we go.

5379
02:42:42,410 --> 02:42:45,810
I'm fine, but also not fine at the same time.

5380
02:42:48,770 --> 02:42:49,210
Alright.

5381
02:42:49,230 --> 02:42:50,690
We almost had the .2s.

5382
02:42:51,330 --> 02:42:52,190
Wait, is it this?

5383
02:42:52,850 --> 02:42:54,010
Just like King of the Hill, right?

5384
02:42:55,290 --> 02:42:57,050
I have no idea what my ult is.

5385
02:42:57,730 --> 02:42:59,150
I don't know either.

5386
02:43:01,690 --> 02:43:02,530
You don't know?

5387
02:43:02,830 --> 02:43:03,410
I don't know.

5388
02:43:03,590 --> 02:43:04,330
How do you play this game?

5389
02:43:04,510 --> 02:43:06,410
I don't play Freya enough.

5390
02:43:08,390 --> 02:43:09,370
Okay, that's fine.

5391
02:43:09,510 --> 02:43:10,190
We killed three.

5392
02:43:11,470 --> 02:43:12,450
What is he doing?

5393
02:43:14,290 --> 02:43:14,870
No!

5394
02:43:15,490 --> 02:43:17,550
Not the fan that happened!

5395
02:43:18,070 --> 02:43:20,250
He does this to fan that happened!

5396
02:43:21,010 --> 02:43:22,050
Okay, we won.

5397
02:43:22,290 --> 02:43:23,090
We won.

5398
02:43:23,810 --> 02:43:24,930
I got fan.

5399
02:43:27,030 --> 02:43:27,610
Alright.

5400
02:43:28,650 --> 02:43:31,470
Wait, why does this guy have his like name is highlighted?

5401
02:43:31,470 --> 02:43:32,130
Why is that?

5402
02:43:32,310 --> 02:43:33,830
Oh, it's the new thing they added.

5403
02:43:34,030 --> 02:43:34,390
It makes you...

5404
02:43:34,390 --> 02:43:35,090
It's so like...

5405
02:43:35,090 --> 02:43:37,470
The more games you play, the more...

5406
02:43:38,390 --> 02:43:40,890
You gain like XP or something to unlock these.

5407
02:43:41,070 --> 02:43:42,870
So it makes you look like cooler, I guess.

5408
02:43:44,710 --> 02:43:45,550
I don't know.

5409
02:43:45,550 --> 02:43:45,730
Oh...

5410
02:43:46,570 --> 02:43:47,370
Right, right, right, right.

5411
02:43:47,390 --> 02:43:48,610
So like be like, oh look at me.

5412
02:43:48,830 --> 02:43:49,550
I have this.

5413
02:43:50,530 --> 02:43:51,090
Weapon power.

5414
02:43:52,370 --> 02:43:53,810
Just do weapon power.

5415
02:43:54,090 --> 02:43:56,250
Wait, so can I buy items like in the middle of...

5416
02:43:56,250 --> 02:43:56,390
Yeah.

5417
02:43:57,050 --> 02:43:58,290
So you can sell them.

5418
02:43:58,410 --> 02:43:58,890
You can only buy it like now.

5419
02:43:59,050 --> 02:43:59,850
Oh, you can only buy it now.

5420
02:43:59,970 --> 02:44:00,430
You can only buy it now.

5421
02:44:00,450 --> 02:44:01,510
You can sell your items too.

5422
02:44:03,330 --> 02:44:04,630
It's like, oh, it's like a name.

5423
02:44:04,630 --> 02:44:06,990
You were saying it's like a name card thing.

5424
02:44:09,570 --> 02:44:10,470
Breach ammo.

5425
02:44:10,790 --> 02:44:11,850
Oh, that makes sense.

5426
02:44:12,530 --> 02:44:14,630
Oh no, only 20 seconds?

5427
02:44:15,010 --> 02:44:15,750
I'm just...

5428
02:44:15,750 --> 02:44:17,950
Oh, I don't know what I'm doing guys.

5429
02:44:18,010 --> 02:44:19,430
I'm so confused.

5430
02:44:23,570 --> 02:44:24,270
More ammo.

5431
02:44:24,290 --> 02:44:25,310
I just clicked some random stuff.

5432
02:44:25,310 --> 02:44:26,050
Me too, me too.

5433
02:44:28,390 --> 02:44:31,610
Alright, I'm gonna try and steal the enemy team's build.

5434
02:44:31,610 --> 02:44:32,570
Wait, just to confirm.

5435
02:44:32,870 --> 02:44:34,750
Even when you die, you can't buy stuff, right?

5436
02:44:35,210 --> 02:44:35,450
Yeah.

5437
02:44:35,730 --> 02:44:37,350
Yeah, it's only between rounds.

5438
02:44:37,790 --> 02:44:38,250
Oh, okay.

5439
02:44:38,670 --> 02:44:39,150
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5440
02:44:39,390 --> 02:44:39,910
Okay, this guy...

5441
02:44:39,910 --> 02:44:40,570
Ah, okay, okay, okay.

5442
02:44:40,690 --> 02:44:41,350
I see, I see, I see.

5443
02:44:41,630 --> 02:44:44,150
Okay, I'm gonna steal that power up.

5444
02:44:44,330 --> 02:44:45,130
If we make it that far.

5445
02:44:47,290 --> 02:44:47,570
Alright.

5446
02:44:49,970 --> 02:44:50,650
Figured it out.

5447
02:44:53,910 --> 02:44:54,730
Yeah, you can also...

5448
02:44:54,730 --> 02:44:57,290
Oh yeah, you can go to the practice stadium to like, see...

5449
02:44:57,290 --> 02:44:58,750
Like, experiment with builds.

5450
02:45:00,570 --> 02:45:03,450
So like, while we're like waiting, Q, we can experiment.

5451
02:45:03,850 --> 02:45:03,970
I know.

5452
02:45:05,890 --> 02:45:06,330
Oh.

5453
02:45:06,910 --> 02:45:07,730
Oh my god.

5454
02:45:07,890 --> 02:45:11,290
Kind of reminds me of deadlock a little bit, but more like paladins, I guess.

5455
02:45:11,750 --> 02:45:11,950
Yeah.

5456
02:45:12,190 --> 02:45:14,010
Oh, you can counter swap too.

5457
02:45:14,170 --> 02:45:14,650
That's the thing.

5458
02:45:16,210 --> 02:45:17,070
Go high ground.

5459
02:45:20,470 --> 02:45:20,950
Nice.

5460
02:45:22,670 --> 02:45:23,150
Nice.

5461
02:45:25,910 --> 02:45:27,230
Oh my god, Ana's one.

5462
02:45:29,330 --> 02:45:30,850
Oh my god, you're still one!

5463
02:45:30,950 --> 02:45:31,370
Stop!

5464
02:45:32,350 --> 02:45:33,570
Oh my god, bitch.

5465
02:45:35,170 --> 02:45:36,170
Okay, I got it.

5466
02:45:36,250 --> 02:45:36,710
I got Rizze.

5467
02:45:38,030 --> 02:45:39,750
She was one, I couldn't get him.

5468
02:45:43,070 --> 02:45:43,950
Shoot, I died.

5469
02:45:45,450 --> 02:45:46,230
Oh, I got her.

5470
02:45:49,110 --> 02:45:49,830
That's right.

5471
02:45:49,890 --> 02:45:50,390
Oh, I got Rizze.

5472
02:45:50,470 --> 02:45:51,230
That's right.

5473
02:45:51,730 --> 02:45:53,430
You don't wanna peek now!

5474
02:45:53,950 --> 02:45:55,710
Okay, I zoned him out.

5475
02:45:56,330 --> 02:45:58,710
Wait, chat, how do I change my POV?

5476
02:45:59,930 --> 02:46:01,690
Oh, yeah, I forgot about that!

5477
02:46:02,830 --> 02:46:04,190
Don't worry, we'll figure it out.

5478
02:46:04,350 --> 02:46:05,950
Oh, I think our Mora might be dead.

5479
02:46:06,910 --> 02:46:07,070
Yeah!

5480
02:46:07,790 --> 02:46:07,890
Oh.

5481
02:46:08,410 --> 02:46:08,850
That's you?

5482
02:46:10,230 --> 02:46:11,130
Okay, I got soldier.

5483
02:46:13,910 --> 02:46:14,350
Alright.

5484
02:46:18,340 --> 02:46:19,500
Oh, she's one, she's one.

5485
02:46:19,620 --> 02:46:19,840
Nice.

5486
02:46:20,740 --> 02:46:21,340
Oh.

5487
02:46:22,080 --> 02:46:23,080
I got Aversa!

5488
02:46:23,260 --> 02:46:23,560
Nice!

5489
02:46:24,520 --> 02:46:25,180
Where's the cast?

5490
02:46:27,020 --> 02:46:28,420
Alright, no, she's dead.

5491
02:46:28,880 --> 02:46:29,440
We did it.

5492
02:46:30,860 --> 02:46:31,880
I'm a flanking.

5493
02:46:33,500 --> 02:46:34,540
I'ma go flank.

5494
02:46:35,220 --> 02:46:36,560
You take the front line.

5495
02:46:39,900 --> 02:46:41,020
Don't worry, you're alive!

5496
02:46:41,240 --> 02:46:43,880
I do, like, toothpick damage.

5497
02:46:44,660 --> 02:46:48,960
Oh my god, why me?

5498
02:46:49,240 --> 02:46:51,160
Oh, I have an Arisa chasing me right now.

5499
02:46:52,440 --> 02:46:54,340
I had an Arisa chasing me, I'm okay.

5500
02:46:54,940 --> 02:46:55,820
Oh, never mind.

5501
02:46:56,060 --> 02:46:57,540
You guys are not okay.

5502
02:46:57,900 --> 02:46:59,220
It's okay, he doesn't know I'm here.

5503
02:47:00,980 --> 02:47:01,880
Okay, I'm thinking.

5504
02:47:01,880 --> 02:47:02,980
In the menu.

5505
02:47:06,140 --> 02:47:07,480
I'm gonna fix my thingy.

5506
02:47:07,580 --> 02:47:07,980
Video.

5507
02:47:09,700 --> 02:47:10,460
What the fuck?

5508
02:47:12,470 --> 02:47:13,190
Oh my god, I have my knees.

5509
02:47:18,390 --> 02:47:19,130
Okay, nice.

5510
02:47:25,090 --> 02:47:26,250
It's okay, we won.

5511
02:47:28,310 --> 02:47:29,430
Oh, nice, really?

5512
02:47:29,570 --> 02:47:31,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we did it, it's okay.

5513
02:47:32,030 --> 02:47:34,510
No, we didn't win yet, but, like, we won.

5514
02:47:35,530 --> 02:47:37,930
Okay, and now I think I can find it for you.

5515
02:47:38,930 --> 02:47:40,250
But after we win this.

5516
02:47:41,370 --> 02:47:41,730
Yeah!

5517
02:47:43,070 --> 02:47:43,910
Oh, okay.

5518
02:47:44,350 --> 02:47:44,730
Alright.

5519
02:47:44,970 --> 02:47:46,730
I think I got instructions in the chat.

5520
02:47:46,930 --> 02:47:47,810
I think I got it.

5521
02:47:47,830 --> 02:47:48,010
Oh, okay.

5522
02:47:51,870 --> 02:47:52,310
Maybe?

5523
02:47:52,310 --> 02:47:52,750
Woohoo!

5524
02:47:53,130 --> 02:47:57,090
The UI for this kind of reminds me of, um, Pokemon Unite.

5525
02:47:57,390 --> 02:47:58,270
Oh, that's true.

5526
02:47:58,650 --> 02:47:59,050
Yeah.

5527
02:47:59,690 --> 02:48:00,690
A little pen.

5528
02:48:00,990 --> 02:48:02,610
Now you mention it, I see it.

5529
02:48:02,750 --> 02:48:03,330
I like the announcer, kind of.

5530
02:48:04,290 --> 02:48:05,790
It's options...

5531
02:48:05,790 --> 02:48:06,350
Oh, I see.

5532
02:48:06,770 --> 02:48:09,310
Oh, it's options, control, stadium.

5533
02:48:12,210 --> 02:48:13,590
Oh... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5534
02:48:14,170 --> 02:48:14,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5535
02:48:15,050 --> 02:48:18,290
Okay, now... Now I can steal their build.

5536
02:48:26,220 --> 02:48:31,260
Uh... One max ammo per... Okay.

5537
02:48:31,460 --> 02:48:31,840
So cooked.

5538
02:48:32,400 --> 02:48:33,080
Okay.

5539
02:48:33,220 --> 02:48:34,080
Am I cooked, chat?

5540
02:48:34,340 --> 02:48:36,380
No, we're doing so well.

5541
02:48:36,760 --> 02:48:38,420
I believe in us.

5542
02:48:39,020 --> 02:48:41,000
I believe in us.

5543
02:48:42,100 --> 02:48:42,580
Let's see.

5544
02:48:42,940 --> 02:48:43,160
Ooh.

5545
02:48:43,480 --> 02:48:44,580
I want to get the reduction.

5546
02:48:44,980 --> 02:48:46,740
And then... I don't need more armor.

5547
02:48:48,700 --> 02:48:50,380
If I can survive without armor.

5548
02:48:53,740 --> 02:48:56,040
I don't know what some of the stuff I bought is, but I just bought it.

5549
02:48:57,640 --> 02:48:58,920
If it works, it works.

5550
02:48:59,800 --> 02:49:00,160
Okay.

5551
02:49:00,420 --> 02:49:01,480
I'm gonna get more weapon power.

5552
02:49:02,560 --> 02:49:02,800
Yeah!

5553
02:49:03,540 --> 02:49:04,520
Armor's for nerds.

5554
02:49:04,620 --> 02:49:05,600
If I kill them...

5555
02:49:05,600 --> 02:49:09,100
If I kill them in time, then, like, more damage is better.

5556
02:49:11,160 --> 02:49:14,040
Why put any defense if you may just die faster?

5557
02:49:17,780 --> 02:49:19,300
Mercy, what did they do to you?

5558
02:49:20,080 --> 02:49:20,820
What does she look like?

5559
02:49:20,980 --> 02:49:22,960
Oh, that's the Magical Girl weapon.

5560
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:26,880
Or... It's like the... Heirloom.

5561
02:49:26,900 --> 02:49:27,700
She lost all her soul.

5562
02:49:29,700 --> 02:49:30,400
Oh, right.

5563
02:49:31,120 --> 02:49:34,020
Well, I mean, Magical Girl kind of is, like, you sign away your souls.

5564
02:49:34,020 --> 02:49:34,440
Yeah, exactly.

5565
02:49:34,940 --> 02:49:35,440
What the...

5566
02:49:36,240 --> 02:49:37,480
Where did he come from?

5567
02:49:37,480 --> 02:49:37,800
Oh, nice.

5568
02:49:39,800 --> 02:49:42,680
I don't know where the fuck that guy came from.

5569
02:49:42,900 --> 02:49:45,480
He literally just Mach 7 ran to me.

5570
02:49:48,040 --> 02:49:49,340
I was so confused.

5571
02:49:52,920 --> 02:49:53,580
Oh, no.

5572
02:49:54,180 --> 02:49:54,380
Wait.

5573
02:49:54,880 --> 02:49:55,080
Wait.

5574
02:49:55,320 --> 02:49:56,760
Wait, you guys weren't supposed to die.

5575
02:49:57,060 --> 02:49:57,620
Wait a minute.

5576
02:49:57,820 --> 02:49:58,400
Wait a minute.

5577
02:49:58,700 --> 02:49:59,280
Wait a minute.

5578
02:50:00,320 --> 02:50:00,800
Nice.

5579
02:50:01,560 --> 02:50:02,280
It's fine.

5580
02:50:03,440 --> 02:50:04,040
Where are they?

5581
02:50:04,740 --> 02:50:05,180
Oh.

5582
02:50:05,360 --> 02:50:05,740
On point.

5583
02:50:05,740 --> 02:50:05,760
Wait.

5584
02:50:06,440 --> 02:50:07,720
Oh, the Moira is super low.

5585
02:50:08,040 --> 02:50:08,240
Yeah, yeah.

5586
02:50:08,280 --> 02:50:09,500
But our point is in the back now.

5587
02:50:09,680 --> 02:50:10,600
Where our point is at the back.

5588
02:50:10,720 --> 02:50:11,040
Oh, no.

5589
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:12,880
This is our point.

5590
02:50:14,280 --> 02:50:15,240
Yeah, this is our point.

5591
02:50:15,340 --> 02:50:16,520
Cause they already capped.

5592
02:50:16,520 --> 02:50:17,680
In 10 seconds.

5593
02:50:17,680 --> 02:50:17,720
In 10 seconds.

5594
02:50:19,040 --> 02:50:19,400
Ah.

5595
02:50:22,700 --> 02:50:23,260
Okay.

5596
02:50:23,680 --> 02:50:24,100
Oh, no.

5597
02:50:24,260 --> 02:50:24,780
He's here too.

5598
02:50:25,340 --> 02:50:25,700
He knows.

5599
02:50:27,160 --> 02:50:28,640
The Moira is so low.

5600
02:50:29,720 --> 02:50:30,000
No.

5601
02:50:30,320 --> 02:50:30,440
No.

5602
02:50:31,280 --> 02:50:31,560
No.

5603
02:50:31,560 --> 02:50:31,700
No.

5604
02:50:33,760 --> 02:50:34,880
I whiffed.

5605
02:50:34,880 --> 02:50:36,220
I whiffed.

5606
02:50:36,400 --> 02:50:37,580
I whiffed.

5607
02:50:37,680 --> 02:50:37,920
I whiffed.

5608
02:50:38,560 --> 02:50:39,000
Whiffed.

5609
02:50:39,060 --> 02:50:39,440
No.

5610
02:50:41,400 --> 02:50:42,120
It's okay.

5611
02:50:42,140 --> 02:50:42,840
I believe in you.

5612
02:50:48,940 --> 02:50:51,060
It's a Moira.

5613
02:50:51,060 --> 02:50:51,100
It's a Moira.

5614
02:50:51,220 --> 02:50:52,160
It's a Moira.

5615
02:50:52,160 --> 02:50:53,440
It's a Moira.

5616
02:50:53,440 --> 02:50:53,760
It's a Moira.

5617
02:50:54,400 --> 02:50:55,380
It's a Moira.

5618
02:50:55,380 --> 02:50:55,880
It's a Moira.

5619
02:50:56,080 --> 02:50:57,140
It's a Moira.

5620
02:50:57,160 --> 02:50:58,260
It's a Moira.

5621
02:50:58,320 --> 02:50:59,640
It's a Moira.

5622
02:50:59,640 --> 02:51:01,000
It's a Moira.

5623
02:51:01,260 --> 02:51:01,980
It's a Moira.

5624
02:51:02,200 --> 02:51:02,980
It's a Moira.

5625
02:51:03,280 --> 02:51:03,800
It's a Moira.

5626
02:51:03,800 --> 02:51:04,380
It's a Moira.

5627
02:51:04,440 --> 02:51:04,580
It's a Moira.

5628
02:51:04,600 --> 02:51:04,680
It's a Moira.

5629
02:51:04,800 --> 02:51:04,840
It's a Moira.

5630
02:51:04,840 --> 02:51:05,240
It's a Moira.

5631
02:51:05,360 --> 02:51:06,040
It's a Moira.

5632
02:51:06,040 --> 02:51:06,160
It's a Moira.

5633
02:51:06,260 --> 02:51:06,820
It's a Moira.

5634
02:51:07,240 --> 02:51:08,360
It's a Moira.

5635
02:51:11,840 --> 02:51:13,780
It's a Moira.

5636
02:51:15,460 --> 02:51:16,980
I got very greedy.

5637
02:51:20,620 --> 02:51:22,020
You're distracting them, right?

5638
02:51:22,300 --> 02:51:22,380
Yeah, exactly.

5639
02:51:22,500 --> 02:51:22,740
Yeah, yeah.

5640
02:51:22,860 --> 02:51:23,540
I was baiting them.

5641
02:51:24,260 --> 02:51:27,800
Yeah, I'm always... baiting them.

5642
02:51:32,220 --> 02:51:34,500
Oh my god, your stupid strafe pattern.

5643
02:51:37,120 --> 02:51:38,820
Oh my god, stop looking at me.

5644
02:51:39,820 --> 02:51:42,080
Yeah, you can strafe here.

5645
02:51:43,580 --> 02:51:45,300
Oh, I'm not looking at that.

5646
02:51:51,120 --> 02:51:52,620
Oh, I got the cast.

5647
02:51:52,720 --> 02:51:53,640
Oh, man.

5648
02:51:53,720 --> 02:51:54,440
I got two, I got two.

5649
02:51:58,630 --> 02:51:59,110
No.

5650
02:51:59,530 --> 02:52:00,390
Oh, I got rezzed.

5651
02:52:00,510 --> 02:52:00,890
Thank you.

5652
02:52:01,610 --> 02:52:02,570
He's huge.

5653
02:52:07,330 --> 02:52:08,310
I'm still alive.

5654
02:52:08,650 --> 02:52:09,450
I'm still alive.

5655
02:52:10,010 --> 02:52:12,570
Alright, we both clutched when we needed to.

5656
02:52:13,170 --> 02:52:15,450
Oh, wait.

5657
02:52:15,770 --> 02:52:16,850
I have a right-click with that.

5658
02:52:19,050 --> 02:52:19,530
Five.

5659
02:52:24,990 --> 02:52:26,030
I'm still alive.

5660
02:52:26,030 --> 02:52:26,870
Nice, we did it.

5661
02:52:27,290 --> 02:52:29,810
Oh my god, I'm still alive.

5662
02:52:30,450 --> 02:52:30,610
Oh.

5663
02:52:31,350 --> 02:52:32,190
That was scary.

5664
02:52:33,690 --> 02:52:36,070
So how many points do we need to win?

5665
02:52:36,130 --> 02:52:37,430
We need to win four rounds.

5666
02:52:37,730 --> 02:52:38,530
It's four rounds.

5667
02:52:39,170 --> 02:52:40,210
Oh, okay.

5668
02:52:40,210 --> 02:52:41,190
Just one more round.

5669
02:52:42,110 --> 02:52:43,030
Oh, GG.

5670
02:52:43,330 --> 02:52:44,010
They already gave up.

5671
02:52:44,450 --> 02:52:45,830
They already gave up.

5672
02:52:45,830 --> 02:52:45,890
They already gave up.

5673
02:52:47,210 --> 02:52:48,410
Alright, I'm gonna steal.

5674
02:52:48,930 --> 02:52:50,830
So it goes to a bunch of different maps, huh?

5675
02:52:50,830 --> 02:52:51,110
Yeah.

5676
02:52:51,450 --> 02:52:53,830
Yeah, so like it gives you different options.

5677
02:52:54,190 --> 02:52:55,130
Alright, what did they use?

5678
02:52:55,310 --> 02:52:56,110
Attack speed.

5679
02:52:56,590 --> 02:52:58,130
Oh my god, it's just all ammo.

5680
02:52:58,130 --> 02:52:58,690
This guy...

5681
02:52:58,690 --> 02:53:00,630
It's like this guy knows how to play Cassidy.

5682
02:53:02,390 --> 02:53:03,790
Wait, how can you see their stuff?

5683
02:53:04,050 --> 02:53:04,850
Uh, you go...

5684
02:53:04,850 --> 02:53:06,770
You press tab, and then you look at enemy builds.

5685
02:53:06,890 --> 02:53:08,170
So you can steal their builds.

5686
02:53:08,690 --> 02:53:09,890
But you don't know what to do.

5687
02:53:11,490 --> 02:53:12,510
That's what I'm doing.

5688
02:53:12,730 --> 02:53:13,570
I don't know what I'm...

5689
02:53:13,570 --> 02:53:14,450
I don't know what I'm doing.

5690
02:53:14,790 --> 02:53:16,170
So I'm just stealing their builds.

5691
02:53:16,170 --> 02:53:18,850
And it's safe to say, the teams are in the zone.

5692
02:53:19,290 --> 02:53:19,670
Alright.

5693
02:53:21,090 --> 02:53:21,750
I see.

5694
02:53:21,750 --> 02:53:25,010
It's okay, we are a four stack, and we also want to say GG.

5695
02:53:27,850 --> 02:53:30,850
Oh, wait, they're a four stack?

5696
02:53:31,210 --> 02:53:31,550
Sad.

5697
02:53:34,170 --> 02:53:35,050
What's your build?

5698
02:53:37,430 --> 02:53:38,470
Um, I don't know.

5699
02:53:40,090 --> 02:53:40,710
Don't look.

5700
02:53:40,970 --> 02:53:41,590
Don't look.

5701
02:53:42,170 --> 02:53:42,950
I'm looking.

5702
02:53:43,150 --> 02:53:43,910
I'm looking.

5703
02:53:44,450 --> 02:53:45,990
I've never played the Freya before.

5704
02:53:46,730 --> 02:53:46,830
Oh, I see.

5705
02:53:46,930 --> 02:53:47,670
I was looking at my build.

5706
02:53:50,090 --> 02:53:51,910
It's kind of fun, I guess.

5707
02:53:52,130 --> 02:53:52,230
Yeah.

5708
02:53:54,570 --> 02:53:56,250
We don't have enough time.

5709
02:53:56,830 --> 02:53:57,790
Yeah, it's weird.

5710
02:53:58,050 --> 02:53:59,890
Freya's thing is weird.

5711
02:54:03,310 --> 02:54:05,190
It's not hitscan, I feel like, right?

5712
02:54:05,370 --> 02:54:06,990
No, it's very fast projectile.

5713
02:54:07,970 --> 02:54:08,930
That's Freya's.

5714
02:54:09,990 --> 02:54:12,270
So it feels a little off, you know?

5715
02:54:12,270 --> 02:54:13,610
When you're trying to...

5716
02:54:13,610 --> 02:54:15,770
You have to lead your shot just a little bit.

5717
02:54:16,830 --> 02:54:17,050
Yeah.

5718
02:54:20,910 --> 02:54:21,810
That's right, Cass.

5719
02:54:21,910 --> 02:54:22,550
I see you.

5720
02:54:28,400 --> 02:54:29,260
Oh my god.

5721
02:54:29,480 --> 02:54:30,500
Running away, huh?

5722
02:54:31,800 --> 02:54:32,460
That's right.

5723
02:54:33,300 --> 02:54:34,800
No running away here.

5724
02:54:39,100 --> 02:54:40,380
Oh my god, he's so low.

5725
02:54:40,880 --> 02:54:41,220
Nice.

5726
02:54:42,200 --> 02:54:42,680
Yeah.

5727
02:54:42,980 --> 02:54:43,300
Oh my god.

5728
02:54:43,540 --> 02:54:44,440
They're both over there though.

5729
02:54:44,580 --> 02:54:45,840
DPS on the right there.

5730
02:54:46,240 --> 02:54:46,900
That's fine.

5731
02:54:47,400 --> 02:54:48,040
You don't have heals.

5732
02:54:49,320 --> 02:54:50,020
We got him.

5733
02:54:50,120 --> 02:54:50,440
We got him.

5734
02:54:51,580 --> 02:54:52,700
That's fucking right.

5735
02:54:53,560 --> 02:54:53,820
Nice.

5736
02:54:53,940 --> 02:54:54,140
Teamwork.

5737
02:54:54,940 --> 02:54:56,800
You're freaking carrying this team.

5738
02:54:56,800 --> 02:54:58,240
It's too easy for you.

5739
02:54:58,240 --> 02:54:59,000
Oh no, no.

5740
02:54:59,060 --> 02:55:00,100
I'm whiffing so...

5741
02:55:00,100 --> 02:55:01,760
No, I'm whiffing so hard.

5742
02:55:02,280 --> 02:55:02,660
I...

5743
02:55:02,660 --> 02:55:04,360
It's like bronze right now.

5744
02:55:05,760 --> 02:55:06,420
It's okay.

5745
02:55:06,560 --> 02:55:08,340
You carried me on TS.

5746
02:55:08,640 --> 02:55:09,180
That's why it's easy.

5747
02:55:09,620 --> 02:55:10,760
You carried me on TS.

5748
02:55:11,040 --> 02:55:12,300
I carry you on Overwatch.

5749
02:55:12,620 --> 02:55:13,300
I don't know about that.

5750
02:55:13,420 --> 02:55:14,180
I don't know about that.

5751
02:55:14,180 --> 02:55:14,400
Oh.

5752
02:55:14,400 --> 02:55:14,680
Oh.

5753
02:55:15,020 --> 02:55:15,460
Oh.

5754
02:55:15,480 --> 02:55:15,720
Oh my god.

5755
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:16,500
Actually, flatbang.

5756
02:55:16,780 --> 02:55:17,020
Whoops.

5757
02:55:17,220 --> 02:55:17,680
That's awkward.

5758
02:55:18,420 --> 02:55:18,920
He has ult.

5759
02:55:20,300 --> 02:55:21,520
Oh, he doesn't have ult.

5760
02:55:21,780 --> 02:55:22,060
Oh.

5761
02:55:25,770 --> 02:55:26,590
Oh my god.

5762
02:55:26,590 --> 02:55:26,710
Oh my god.

5763
02:55:27,210 --> 02:55:27,990
Heal your team.

5764
02:55:28,470 --> 02:55:29,670
Heal your team, Mora!

5765
02:55:30,190 --> 02:55:30,890
Oh, oh.

5766
02:55:31,050 --> 02:55:31,650
Nice, nice.

5767
02:55:32,650 --> 02:55:33,430
Are Mora...

5768
02:55:33,430 --> 02:55:34,350
No, no, no.

5769
02:55:34,350 --> 02:55:34,950
They're Mora.

5770
02:55:35,150 --> 02:55:37,390
They're Mora let me kill the cast.

5771
02:55:37,590 --> 02:55:38,530
Wait, where am I?

5772
02:55:43,910 --> 02:55:44,510
It's okay.

5773
02:55:44,810 --> 02:55:45,250
They're mad.

5774
02:55:45,550 --> 02:55:46,210
Because they're bad.

5775
02:55:46,570 --> 02:55:47,170
I'm outta here.

5776
02:55:47,410 --> 02:55:48,030
Yeah, you should leave.

5777
02:55:48,270 --> 02:55:49,850
I saw the nano boost.

5778
02:55:54,310 --> 02:55:56,450
I don't even know what my ultimate is.

5779
02:55:56,490 --> 02:55:57,210
Is it a bomb?

5780
02:55:57,850 --> 02:55:58,950
I don't know either.

5781
02:55:59,210 --> 02:55:59,950
That's a good question.

5782
02:56:04,350 --> 02:56:05,650
That's a good question.

5783
02:56:05,930 --> 02:56:06,450
Wait, take your cell?

5784
02:56:07,310 --> 02:56:08,810
Guys, what is...

5785
02:56:08,810 --> 02:56:08,970
Wait, take your cell?

5786
02:56:08,970 --> 02:56:09,050
Wait, take your cell?

5787
02:56:09,910 --> 02:56:10,470
Yay!

5788
02:56:12,030 --> 02:56:13,450
A pulling bomb.

5789
02:56:13,850 --> 02:56:14,130
Oh.

5790
02:56:14,150 --> 02:56:14,490
Oh.

5791
02:56:14,790 --> 02:56:14,890
Okay.

5792
02:56:15,190 --> 02:56:16,530
It's like a mini-grab.

5793
02:56:17,290 --> 02:56:18,250
It's like a grab.

5794
02:56:18,590 --> 02:56:18,690
Yay.

5795
02:56:18,690 --> 02:56:19,210
Yeah, yeah.

5796
02:56:19,490 --> 02:56:19,710
Yeah.

5797
02:56:20,270 --> 02:56:20,590
Okay.

5798
02:56:21,110 --> 02:56:21,810
Makes sense.

5799
02:56:23,730 --> 02:56:24,170
Nice.

5800
02:56:24,330 --> 02:56:25,330
Okay, I figured it out.

5801
02:56:25,450 --> 02:56:26,550
I figured out how to aim again.

5802
02:56:26,850 --> 02:56:27,210
Oh, easy.

5803
02:56:28,050 --> 02:56:29,210
What did I do?

5804
02:56:29,910 --> 02:56:31,110
Wow, let's see.

5805
02:56:31,930 --> 02:56:32,210
Let's see.

5806
02:56:32,210 --> 02:56:32,390
Let's see.

5807
02:56:34,530 --> 02:56:35,590
What did I...

5808
02:56:36,210 --> 02:56:37,090
What is this?

5809
02:56:38,350 --> 02:56:38,910
Oh.

5810
02:56:41,330 --> 02:56:42,350
That's not...

5811
02:56:42,350 --> 02:56:43,130
Oh, yeah.

5812
02:56:43,310 --> 02:56:43,790
Okay, now I see.

5813
02:56:44,130 --> 02:56:44,370
Whoa!

5814
02:56:45,670 --> 02:56:46,230
Huge!

5815
02:56:47,230 --> 02:56:48,610
Look at that play!

5816
02:56:49,430 --> 02:56:49,630
Whoa!

5817
02:56:50,910 --> 02:56:51,370
Oh, wait.

5818
02:56:51,390 --> 02:56:53,570
I'll do tank and DPS too.

5819
02:56:53,810 --> 02:56:53,850
I thought it was good.

5820
02:56:53,850 --> 02:56:53,890
Oh, man.

5821
02:56:54,090 --> 02:56:54,310
Yeah.

5822
02:56:55,250 --> 02:56:56,590
I gotta re-queue again.

5823
02:56:57,270 --> 02:56:57,510
Oh, okay.

5824
02:56:57,510 --> 02:56:58,750
I changed the tank and...

5825
02:56:58,750 --> 02:57:00,050
I changed my rolls too.

5826
02:57:01,930 --> 02:57:03,470
My point and click adventure.

5827
02:57:03,850 --> 02:57:03,870
Okay.

5828
02:57:04,010 --> 02:57:04,630
It's just like...

5829
02:57:04,630 --> 02:57:04,910
Hold on.

5830
02:57:05,470 --> 02:57:05,690
Alright.

5831
02:57:06,030 --> 02:57:06,770
Oh, here.

5832
02:57:06,930 --> 02:57:07,370
You can do...

5833
02:57:07,370 --> 02:57:09,850
I'll do practice range so you can look at the different builds you can do.

5834
02:57:12,050 --> 02:57:12,530
Okay.

5835
02:57:13,490 --> 02:57:14,170
Oh, never mind.

5836
02:57:15,290 --> 02:57:16,150
Never mind.

5837
02:57:16,290 --> 02:57:16,430
Never mind.

5838
02:57:16,430 --> 02:57:16,750
Never mind.

5839
02:57:17,290 --> 02:57:19,110
I guess we'll figure it out here.

5840
02:57:19,290 --> 02:57:20,290
This guy wouldn't absorb anything anyways.

5841
02:57:20,910 --> 02:57:21,390
Exactly.

5842
02:57:21,850 --> 02:57:22,130
Okay.

5843
02:57:23,450 --> 02:57:23,930
Uh...

5844
02:57:23,930 --> 02:57:24,730
I'll do...

5845
02:57:24,730 --> 02:57:25,930
I'll do...

5846
02:57:25,930 --> 02:57:27,190
Call of Duty for real.

5847
02:57:29,830 --> 02:57:31,070
Kinda like playing this chick.

5848
02:57:31,250 --> 02:57:31,670
I'll play again.

5849
02:57:31,910 --> 02:57:32,210
Yeah.

5850
02:57:32,690 --> 02:57:34,070
Yeah, just figure out the...

5851
02:57:34,070 --> 02:57:36,130
I'm curious to see the baby bob.

5852
02:57:37,370 --> 02:57:38,690
Oh, the baby bob?

5853
02:57:38,810 --> 02:57:39,490
That's on Ash.

5854
02:57:41,670 --> 02:57:42,990
Yeah, I wanna...

5855
02:57:45,370 --> 02:57:46,290
Okay, I'll try.

5856
02:57:46,830 --> 02:57:48,050
Yeah, it's really...

5857
02:57:48,050 --> 02:57:48,830
It's really cute.

5858
02:57:50,970 --> 02:57:52,250
It's like a little baby.

5859
02:57:52,430 --> 02:57:54,290
It's an actual, like, little tiny baby.

5860
02:57:55,450 --> 02:57:56,190
He's like...

5861
02:57:56,190 --> 02:57:56,970
He's like the size...

5862
02:57:56,970 --> 02:57:59,390
Like, he's basically half the size of us.

5863
02:58:00,990 --> 02:58:02,490
And he's better, apparently.

5864
02:58:02,490 --> 02:58:02,790
How do...

5865
02:58:02,790 --> 02:58:03,510
Is it like a boost?

5866
02:58:03,650 --> 02:58:04,570
Or power-up or something?

5867
02:58:04,770 --> 02:58:06,590
Yeah, it's like one of the power.

5868
02:58:06,950 --> 02:58:07,070
Yeah.

5869
02:58:08,570 --> 02:58:09,370
Like how...

5870
02:58:09,370 --> 02:58:10,330
Look for it.

5871
02:58:10,910 --> 02:58:11,790
Regina George.

5872
02:58:12,270 --> 02:58:12,850
Oh, me.

5873
02:58:13,170 --> 02:58:13,590
And...

5874
02:58:13,590 --> 02:58:13,730
Yeah.

5875
02:58:14,110 --> 02:58:15,030
I can find it.

5876
02:58:17,130 --> 02:58:17,730
I can find it.

5877
02:58:18,390 --> 02:58:19,310
Example build.

5878
02:58:21,030 --> 02:58:23,190
You're using activate tactical visor?

5879
02:58:23,710 --> 02:58:24,010
Oh my god.

5880
02:58:24,110 --> 02:58:25,810
I have like a mini tactical visor.

5881
02:58:29,090 --> 02:58:30,330
Chat, where's the baby bob?

5882
02:58:31,550 --> 02:58:32,430
Wait, I see it.

5883
02:58:32,490 --> 02:58:34,730
Bob jr. Wait, that's what's called?

5884
02:58:34,970 --> 02:58:36,850
Bob jr. Yeah.

5885
02:58:37,750 --> 02:58:38,730
Aw, that's cute.

5886
02:58:40,190 --> 02:58:43,930
I assume this is also weapon power and...

5887
02:58:44,510 --> 02:58:45,270
Ability power?

5888
02:58:46,010 --> 02:58:48,370
What is a good one for a soldier, guys?

5889
02:58:51,470 --> 02:58:52,850
Like, skills damage.

5890
02:59:00,060 --> 02:59:00,940
Chat, what's good?

5891
02:59:01,340 --> 02:59:02,440
Homing rockets?

5892
02:59:04,000 --> 02:59:05,520
What about a mini-tack?

5893
02:59:05,680 --> 02:59:07,060
Okay, I'll do homing rockets.

5894
02:59:08,400 --> 02:59:09,080
Alright.

5895
02:59:10,080 --> 02:59:11,120
Full weapon power.

5896
02:59:11,300 --> 02:59:11,580
Okay.

5897
02:59:17,100 --> 02:59:17,500
Contrabability speed.

5898
02:59:17,500 --> 02:59:17,900
Okay, I need to like...

5899
02:59:17,900 --> 02:59:18,620
Contrabability speed.

5900
02:59:19,160 --> 02:59:20,520
I need to remember how...

5901
02:59:20,520 --> 02:59:22,400
I need to remember the crouch spam for a soldier.

5902
02:59:23,860 --> 02:59:24,600
Oh my god.

5903
02:59:24,740 --> 02:59:25,240
It's so...

5904
02:59:25,240 --> 02:59:25,620
Is that...

5905
02:59:25,620 --> 02:59:26,760
Is that like counter-strike?

5906
02:59:26,960 --> 02:59:27,600
Yeah, yeah.

5907
02:59:27,960 --> 02:59:31,320
I mean, I think over overwatch everybody just like crouch spams too.

5908
02:59:31,580 --> 02:59:32,180
And then...

5909
02:59:32,180 --> 02:59:34,620
You know like the soldier players where they just like...

5910
02:59:34,620 --> 02:59:37,020
Run in the circle like...

5911
02:59:37,020 --> 02:59:37,820
Like that.

5912
02:59:38,440 --> 02:59:39,520
So they can't get hit.

5913
02:59:41,820 --> 02:59:43,640
Like the classic movement.

5914
02:59:44,200 --> 02:59:46,020
Like the classic movement.

5915
02:59:46,360 --> 02:59:47,920
I'm gonna go on high ground.

5916
02:59:52,020 --> 02:59:52,520
Wait.

5917
02:59:52,680 --> 02:59:53,760
Somebody's going here too.

5918
02:59:55,020 --> 02:59:55,540
I hear them.

5919
02:59:56,860 --> 02:59:57,100
Wait.

5920
02:59:58,100 --> 02:59:58,920
Oh my god!

5921
02:59:59,060 --> 03:00:00,060
Somebody save our ride!

5922
03:00:02,320 --> 03:00:03,280
How do I do this?

5923
03:00:03,640 --> 03:00:03,720
Oh!

5924
03:00:04,880 --> 03:00:06,640
Oh, you got... you got...

5925
03:00:06,640 --> 03:00:07,380
Junker is meta.

5926
03:00:08,460 --> 03:00:09,680
Junker is so scary.

5927
03:00:10,020 --> 03:00:10,060
Yeah.

5928
03:00:10,060 --> 03:00:11,020
She's so scary.

5929
03:00:13,040 --> 03:00:13,520
Yeah.

5930
03:00:14,140 --> 03:00:16,900
Okay, to be fair, our entire team was like super split up.

5931
03:00:16,980 --> 03:00:17,180
A big woman.

5932
03:00:17,180 --> 03:00:17,800
Yeah!

5933
03:00:19,200 --> 03:00:19,720
Strong.

5934
03:00:20,220 --> 03:00:20,880
Big woman.

5935
03:00:22,360 --> 03:00:24,960
The entire team was like mega split up there.

5936
03:00:26,740 --> 03:00:28,480
I was like, where did everybody go?

5937
03:00:28,900 --> 03:00:31,200
For some reason, everyone followed me.

5938
03:00:31,320 --> 03:00:32,040
And I don't know why.

5939
03:00:32,280 --> 03:00:33,020
I say...

5940
03:00:34,260 --> 03:00:34,780
Oh.

5941
03:00:35,060 --> 03:00:35,980
It's cause you're...

5942
03:00:35,980 --> 03:00:37,200
You seem like you know what you're doing.

5943
03:00:37,560 --> 03:00:38,180
I don't.

5944
03:00:38,360 --> 03:00:39,240
I don't.

5945
03:00:39,320 --> 03:00:40,080
I usually...

5946
03:00:40,080 --> 03:00:40,400
Oh!

5947
03:00:41,000 --> 03:00:41,560
That sucks.

5948
03:00:41,660 --> 03:00:43,640
We have a ride and they have a maid too.

5949
03:00:44,440 --> 03:00:45,080
Oh no.

5950
03:00:45,980 --> 03:00:47,520
I die so fast.

5951
03:00:47,700 --> 03:00:48,480
It feels so squishy.

5952
03:00:49,120 --> 03:00:49,980
Oh no.

5953
03:00:53,740 --> 03:00:54,860
I'm so scared.

5954
03:00:55,660 --> 03:00:56,560
Should I play Ashe?

5955
03:00:56,880 --> 03:00:58,580
It's like more mid range, right?

5956
03:00:58,680 --> 03:00:59,540
Like long range kind of?

5957
03:00:59,960 --> 03:01:00,300
Uh...

5958
03:01:00,300 --> 03:01:00,980
She's like...

5959
03:01:00,980 --> 03:01:02,680
I think she's any range to be fair.

5960
03:01:05,240 --> 03:01:06,100
Oh, okay.

5961
03:01:07,580 --> 03:01:08,100
That's...

5962
03:01:08,100 --> 03:01:10,660
But to be fair, I don't play Ashe often.

5963
03:01:11,160 --> 03:01:13,860
I think Ashe is actually my worst DPS.

5964
03:01:13,860 --> 03:01:14,940
I think I'm just...

5965
03:01:14,940 --> 03:01:15,860
This sucks.

5966
03:01:18,720 --> 03:01:20,620
I'm just doing like...

5967
03:01:20,620 --> 03:01:21,160
Whoa!

5968
03:01:21,760 --> 03:01:21,880
Whoa!

5969
03:01:22,660 --> 03:01:23,220
Whoa!

5970
03:01:23,880 --> 03:01:23,940
Whoa!

5971
03:01:25,580 --> 03:01:25,900
Whoa!

5972
03:01:28,700 --> 03:01:29,340
Whoa!

5973
03:01:32,240 --> 03:01:33,180
Oh, I killed myself.

5974
03:01:34,360 --> 03:01:35,880
I hit the wall.

5975
03:01:36,660 --> 03:01:37,300
Oh!

5976
03:01:37,840 --> 03:01:38,920
What happened?

5977
03:01:39,360 --> 03:01:40,020
I killed...

5978
03:01:40,020 --> 03:01:41,440
Okay, I strafed.

5979
03:01:41,500 --> 03:01:44,200
And then I wasn't thinking about my strafe pattern.

5980
03:01:44,480 --> 03:01:44,740
I...

5981
03:01:48,260 --> 03:01:51,060
I was starting to jiggle peek their mate.

5982
03:01:51,360 --> 03:01:52,880
And it wasn't working.

5983
03:01:54,840 --> 03:01:57,040
My jiggle peek wasn't working.

5984
03:01:57,180 --> 03:01:58,940
Trying to use pro strats, huh?

5985
03:02:00,140 --> 03:02:01,800
And then I hit the wall.

5986
03:02:02,060 --> 03:02:05,560
I right clicked into the wall when I was jiggle peeking.

5987
03:02:07,780 --> 03:02:08,420
Oh...

5988
03:02:08,420 --> 03:02:10,560
Oh, you like exploded yourself with the rockets?

5989
03:02:10,880 --> 03:02:11,180
Yeah.

5990
03:02:12,120 --> 03:02:13,720
I exploded myself.

5991
03:02:15,600 --> 03:02:15,860
Shit.

5992
03:02:16,720 --> 03:02:17,140
Yeah.

5993
03:02:19,200 --> 03:02:19,840
Okay.

5994
03:02:20,400 --> 03:02:21,380
Soldier is not...

5995
03:02:21,380 --> 03:02:22,040
I just realized...

5996
03:02:22,040 --> 03:02:23,420
Soldier is not that good.

5997
03:02:28,740 --> 03:02:30,560
He seems pretty...

5998
03:02:30,560 --> 03:02:30,820
I don't know.

5999
03:02:31,040 --> 03:02:31,500
Kind of...

6000
03:02:31,500 --> 03:02:32,040
I think like...

6001
03:02:32,040 --> 03:02:33,040
Vanilla, I guess.

6002
03:02:33,260 --> 03:02:35,000
He is that type of character.

6003
03:02:35,360 --> 03:02:37,540
He's like the easiest character to play.

6004
03:02:37,680 --> 03:02:38,380
For DPS.

6005
03:02:38,560 --> 03:02:40,720
But like, I feel like his damage is like...

6006
03:02:40,720 --> 03:02:41,400
Not as good.

6007
03:02:43,960 --> 03:02:44,860
Cassidy was doing...

6008
03:02:44,860 --> 03:02:47,080
I think because I was mostly hitting headshot for Cass.

6009
03:02:47,320 --> 03:02:48,540
That like, it was easier.

6010
03:02:50,300 --> 03:02:52,080
But like, I forgot how like...

6011
03:02:52,160 --> 03:02:53,560
It's like shooting like...

6012
03:02:53,560 --> 03:02:54,820
Fucking toothpicks at people.

6013
03:02:59,140 --> 03:02:59,740
Oh, wait.

6014
03:02:59,780 --> 03:03:00,340
That's not a door.

6015
03:03:00,700 --> 03:03:01,440
Wait, is that a door?

6016
03:03:01,600 --> 03:03:02,320
Wait, that is a door.

6017
03:03:02,660 --> 03:03:03,400
This is not...

6018
03:03:03,400 --> 03:03:03,600
Oh.

6019
03:03:03,880 --> 03:03:04,700
No, I was like...

6020
03:03:04,700 --> 03:03:05,500
Wait, is this a door?

6021
03:03:05,520 --> 03:03:06,140
Oh yeah, it is, it is, it is.

6022
03:03:06,260 --> 03:03:06,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6023
03:03:07,140 --> 03:03:07,940
I was like, wait a minute.

6024
03:03:08,040 --> 03:03:08,540
Why isn't it opening?

6025
03:03:08,540 --> 03:03:08,700
Oh, what up there?

6026
03:03:11,860 --> 03:03:13,760
I was like, why is that door not opening?

6027
03:03:16,620 --> 03:03:17,800
Oh, it's this map.

6028
03:03:18,020 --> 03:03:18,140
Okay.

6029
03:03:18,320 --> 03:03:18,600
Yeah, yeah.

6030
03:03:18,640 --> 03:03:19,940
But it's like a miniature version.

6031
03:03:20,160 --> 03:03:20,620
Oh my god.

6032
03:03:24,890 --> 03:03:26,430
Oh, my little toothpick.

6033
03:03:28,450 --> 03:03:29,730
He's just using cover!

6034
03:03:29,930 --> 03:03:30,450
That's illegal!

6035
03:03:31,050 --> 03:03:31,890
Wait, you guys are dead.

6036
03:03:33,390 --> 03:03:34,310
Wait a minute.

6037
03:03:34,570 --> 03:03:35,170
Wait, wait.

6038
03:03:35,250 --> 03:03:35,570
I'm alive.

6039
03:03:35,750 --> 03:03:35,910
I'm here.

6040
03:03:35,910 --> 03:03:37,750
Oh wait, the rest of our team is dead.

6041
03:03:37,870 --> 03:03:38,410
Where did they go?

6042
03:03:39,170 --> 03:03:40,650
Oh no, you're dead for real.

6043
03:03:40,770 --> 03:03:41,230
I need healing.

6044
03:03:41,530 --> 03:03:42,410
Don't kill me.

6045
03:03:42,790 --> 03:03:43,370
Oh no!

6046
03:03:44,490 --> 03:03:45,450
She's fucking...

6047
03:03:45,450 --> 03:03:46,930
She's using her fucking...

6048
03:03:48,250 --> 03:03:53,070
I was on my heal pad and she like rolled me out of my heal pad.

6049
03:03:54,490 --> 03:03:55,530
It's not...

6050
03:03:55,530 --> 03:03:57,550
I don't think it's us though.

6051
03:03:58,010 --> 03:03:59,090
Never blame ourselves.

6052
03:03:59,970 --> 03:04:01,130
It's not us.

6053
03:04:01,210 --> 03:04:02,070
Yeah, it's our teammates.

6054
03:04:02,390 --> 03:04:02,910
Yeah, exactly.

6055
03:04:03,250 --> 03:04:05,050
Our Mercy isn't healing us.

6056
03:04:06,570 --> 03:04:07,530
It's their fault.

6057
03:04:13,900 --> 03:04:14,760
Mercy's won.

6058
03:04:14,760 --> 03:04:15,800
Fucking stop.

6059
03:04:15,900 --> 03:04:16,540
Oh my god.

6060
03:04:16,640 --> 03:04:17,120
No!

6061
03:04:17,660 --> 03:04:18,740
Oh my god.

6062
03:04:18,880 --> 03:04:20,840
This guy actually knows how to play tank.

6063
03:04:22,340 --> 03:04:24,260
That's why his name is I know.

6064
03:04:26,000 --> 03:04:27,160
Oh my gosh.

6065
03:04:27,860 --> 03:04:28,340
Yeah, I know.

6066
03:04:28,640 --> 03:04:29,240
I know.

6067
03:04:34,040 --> 03:04:34,700
What is that?

6068
03:04:34,800 --> 03:04:35,000
What is that?

6069
03:04:36,640 --> 03:04:37,820
There's a big meatball.

6070
03:04:37,820 --> 03:04:38,820
I saw a big red meatball.

6071
03:04:38,820 --> 03:04:39,440
Oh yeah, that's me.

6072
03:04:39,580 --> 03:04:40,480
Yeah, that's...

6073
03:04:40,480 --> 03:04:40,860
Oh, oops.

6074
03:04:41,740 --> 03:04:42,300
Okay.

6075
03:04:42,480 --> 03:04:42,880
The...

6076
03:04:42,880 --> 03:04:44,340
This isn't fair!

6077
03:04:45,360 --> 03:04:46,960
He's actually getting in!

6078
03:04:46,980 --> 03:04:49,920
I finally have my Bob Jr. Send him out!

6079
03:04:50,060 --> 03:04:50,640
Send him out!

6080
03:04:53,970 --> 03:04:54,810
Oh no.

6081
03:04:54,990 --> 03:04:55,850
The meatball.

6082
03:04:56,650 --> 03:04:57,050
Okay.

6083
03:04:57,810 --> 03:04:59,170
I'm gonna wait a little.

6084
03:04:59,710 --> 03:05:00,930
Until we're all here.

6085
03:05:01,550 --> 03:05:01,950
Okay.

6086
03:05:02,550 --> 03:05:02,810
Alright.

6087
03:05:03,450 --> 03:05:05,330
I've got you in my sights.

6088
03:05:05,710 --> 03:05:06,090
Wait, what?

6089
03:05:06,210 --> 03:05:06,730
Where is...

6090
03:05:07,990 --> 03:05:09,790
Why are they all the way there?

6091
03:05:10,390 --> 03:05:11,310
Excuse me?

6092
03:05:11,630 --> 03:05:13,350
I didn't even get to see my little Bob.

6093
03:05:16,690 --> 03:05:17,810
Why were they here?

6094
03:05:18,990 --> 03:05:20,110
Oh my god.

6095
03:05:20,350 --> 03:05:21,830
These supports are like taking...

6096
03:05:21,830 --> 03:05:22,510
Oh my god.

6097
03:05:22,650 --> 03:05:23,830
They're peeling for each other.

6098
03:05:28,630 --> 03:05:29,650
It's not us.

6099
03:05:29,850 --> 03:05:31,030
Don't worry, Doobie.

6100
03:05:31,170 --> 03:05:31,990
It's not us.

6101
03:05:34,230 --> 03:05:35,950
Okay, if you say so.

6102
03:05:37,130 --> 03:05:38,910
It's never the DPS fault.

6103
03:05:41,130 --> 03:05:42,710
Their tank is sweaty.

6104
03:05:43,090 --> 03:05:43,510
Yeah.

6105
03:05:43,670 --> 03:05:44,130
You know what?

6106
03:05:44,170 --> 03:05:44,570
You're right.

6107
03:05:46,150 --> 03:05:47,410
How dare they try.

6108
03:05:50,650 --> 03:05:52,030
Isn't this like cook play?

6109
03:05:52,770 --> 03:05:53,510
Technically, yeah.

6110
03:05:53,590 --> 03:05:55,690
They don't have an actual ring for it.

6111
03:05:56,210 --> 03:05:56,990
Oh my god.

6112
03:05:57,090 --> 03:05:58,210
I finally got a kill.

6113
03:05:59,630 --> 03:06:00,750
Oh my god.

6114
03:06:01,110 --> 03:06:01,610
Finally.

6115
03:06:05,130 --> 03:06:06,250
Oh my god.

6116
03:06:06,250 --> 03:06:06,350
Oh my god.

6117
03:06:06,350 --> 03:06:06,650
I got it.

6118
03:06:07,350 --> 03:06:07,710
Stop.

6119
03:06:08,310 --> 03:06:08,430
Stop.

6120
03:06:08,750 --> 03:06:09,250
Leave me alone.

6121
03:06:09,570 --> 03:06:10,110
Leave me alone.

6122
03:06:10,890 --> 03:06:11,490
No!

6123
03:06:12,090 --> 03:06:13,050
I killed three!

6124
03:06:13,630 --> 03:06:14,170
Uh oh.

6125
03:06:14,170 --> 03:06:14,750
I killed three!

6126
03:06:16,190 --> 03:06:16,570
No!

6127
03:06:18,990 --> 03:06:19,590
Shoot.

6128
03:06:20,450 --> 03:06:21,510
I can't believe it.

6129
03:06:21,870 --> 03:06:22,170
We can tie?

6130
03:06:22,290 --> 03:06:23,130
Can you tie in this?

6131
03:06:23,370 --> 03:06:25,430
Uh, not tie, but you can...

6132
03:06:25,430 --> 03:06:26,730
We can turn it around.

6133
03:06:26,730 --> 03:06:27,630
Because every...

6134
03:06:27,630 --> 03:06:28,490
We're getting points, right?

6135
03:06:28,570 --> 03:06:30,070
We can easily change our builds.

6136
03:06:31,750 --> 03:06:32,790
Ah, okay.

6137
03:06:32,790 --> 03:06:33,010
Yeah.

6138
03:06:36,970 --> 03:06:37,450
Alright.

6139
03:06:37,630 --> 03:06:38,570
Oh, I can have another power.

6140
03:06:42,310 --> 03:06:42,790
Uh...

6141
03:06:43,730 --> 03:06:44,690
Shooting and...

6142
03:06:44,690 --> 03:06:44,990
Oh.

6143
03:06:46,450 --> 03:06:47,470
Wait, wouldn't this be good?

6144
03:06:47,710 --> 03:06:48,270
Chain gun?

6145
03:06:48,510 --> 03:06:49,510
I'm gonna go with this one.

6146
03:06:49,510 --> 03:06:51,250
And I'm gonna do chain gun.

6147
03:06:52,530 --> 03:06:53,770
And then...

6148
03:06:54,280 --> 03:06:55,870
Maybe more ability power?

6149
03:06:56,490 --> 03:06:59,030
Yeah, I'm just gonna stack up on ability power.

6150
03:07:01,850 --> 03:07:02,780
Oh, Zarya...

6151
03:07:04,110 --> 03:07:04,730
Um...

6152
03:07:04,730 --> 03:07:07,350
Some tanks have some crazy fucking builds, too.

6153
03:07:07,550 --> 03:07:08,490
That you can do.

6154
03:07:09,050 --> 03:07:10,690
I'm surprised we're getting DPS.

6155
03:07:11,290 --> 03:07:13,010
We're getting DPS for this.

6156
03:07:13,510 --> 03:07:16,690
Because you assume that a lot of people want to play DPS in Overwatch.

6157
03:07:17,530 --> 03:07:17,830
Yeah.

6158
03:07:18,630 --> 03:07:19,070
Yeah.

6159
03:07:20,710 --> 03:07:22,030
Zarya is like...

6160
03:07:22,030 --> 03:07:22,610
I think like...

6161
03:07:22,610 --> 03:07:25,750
Tanks, you can do some really fucking crazy builds in tanks.

6162
03:07:26,730 --> 03:07:27,890
From what I've seen.

6163
03:07:29,670 --> 03:07:30,110
Hmm...

6164
03:07:30,110 --> 03:07:31,750
I want to try bling tank, too.

6165
03:07:31,830 --> 03:07:32,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6166
03:07:32,470 --> 03:07:33,770
You should try tank next round.

6167
03:07:34,710 --> 03:07:34,970
Uh...

6168
03:07:34,970 --> 03:07:35,770
Zarya...

6169
03:07:35,770 --> 03:07:36,950
Does like...

6170
03:07:36,950 --> 03:07:39,150
So much damage that you can play...

6171
03:07:39,150 --> 03:07:39,590
Uh...

6172
03:07:39,590 --> 03:07:40,850
If you build her really well.

6173
03:07:41,790 --> 03:07:43,170
Oh, she's in this game mode, too?

6174
03:07:43,310 --> 03:07:43,610
Yeah, yeah.

6175
03:07:43,710 --> 03:07:47,150
Zarya and Junker are like really, really good for this mode.

6176
03:07:48,690 --> 03:07:49,070
Okay.

6177
03:07:49,210 --> 03:07:50,350
I like playing Orisa.

6178
03:07:50,870 --> 03:07:51,250
Orisa.

6179
03:07:51,290 --> 03:07:52,450
Oh, Orisa's good, too.

6180
03:07:52,590 --> 03:07:52,670
Yeah.

6181
03:07:52,790 --> 03:07:54,630
Honestly, all the tanks have good builds for this.

6182
03:07:55,670 --> 03:07:56,290
I think.

6183
03:07:57,530 --> 03:07:59,840
I was playing with one of my tank friends for this mode.

6184
03:08:00,670 --> 03:08:02,810
And like, he was basically like a raid boss.

6185
03:08:04,250 --> 03:08:05,110
With his build.

6186
03:08:05,470 --> 03:08:07,610
So it's like crazy what you can do with it.

6187
03:08:08,350 --> 03:08:09,410
Oh my god.

6188
03:08:09,410 --> 03:08:10,530
I'm leaving this area.

6189
03:08:10,910 --> 03:08:12,050
I don't want to be on that side.

6190
03:08:12,590 --> 03:08:14,290
The side looks very scary.

6191
03:08:19,930 --> 03:08:21,410
This guy is lit over here.

6192
03:08:21,650 --> 03:08:22,050
Oh my...

6193
03:08:22,050 --> 03:08:22,750
They're all lit.

6194
03:08:22,950 --> 03:08:24,150
Nice, nice, nice.

6195
03:08:24,990 --> 03:08:26,690
I say all of them were lit, too.

6196
03:08:27,710 --> 03:08:28,090
Nice.

6197
03:08:35,770 --> 03:08:36,110
Nice.

6198
03:08:40,910 --> 03:08:41,910
Oh, I have to reload.

6199
03:08:42,970 --> 03:08:44,490
No, not the ice cube.

6200
03:08:44,650 --> 03:08:44,890
What is that?

6201
03:08:44,930 --> 03:08:45,290
What is that?

6202
03:08:45,290 --> 03:08:46,450
It's just the Mei...

6203
03:08:46,450 --> 03:08:48,330
The Mei freeze, but...

6204
03:08:49,590 --> 03:08:50,950
Oh my god.

6205
03:08:51,090 --> 03:08:51,670
She's so...

6206
03:08:52,870 --> 03:08:53,470
No!

6207
03:08:54,510 --> 03:08:55,490
I have to reload.

6208
03:08:55,710 --> 03:08:55,930
No!

6209
03:08:56,270 --> 03:08:56,830
No!

6210
03:08:57,170 --> 03:08:57,950
He got armor!

6211
03:08:58,310 --> 03:08:58,910
Juno!

6212
03:09:00,270 --> 03:09:00,870
Minicob!

6213
03:09:01,630 --> 03:09:02,570
Where is he?

6214
03:09:02,790 --> 03:09:03,590
Look at him!

6215
03:09:03,690 --> 03:09:04,470
He's so tiny!

6216
03:09:05,190 --> 03:09:06,370
Look at how tiny he is!

6217
03:09:07,010 --> 03:09:07,210
Oh!

6218
03:09:07,510 --> 03:09:08,130
What the?

6219
03:09:08,590 --> 03:09:09,270
Oh yeah, I know.

6220
03:09:09,570 --> 03:09:10,130
Juno...

6221
03:09:10,130 --> 03:09:11,110
Juno's build...

6222
03:09:11,110 --> 03:09:14,130
Her E can become like really fucking strong.

6223
03:09:14,750 --> 03:09:16,050
Where he can like one shot.

6224
03:09:16,270 --> 03:09:17,670
Like that's her special builds.

6225
03:09:21,090 --> 03:09:22,270
Okay, I got Mercy.

6226
03:09:31,770 --> 03:09:32,670
Oh my god.

6227
03:09:33,450 --> 03:09:33,930
Oh!

6228
03:09:34,210 --> 03:09:34,550
That's a...

6229
03:09:34,550 --> 03:09:35,410
That's a Junker!

6230
03:09:35,570 --> 03:09:35,790
No!

6231
03:09:39,250 --> 03:09:41,030
Aw, so close to ult, too.

6232
03:09:41,370 --> 03:09:42,870
Mora has ult, but she's dead.

6233
03:09:44,950 --> 03:09:45,650
She did.

6234
03:09:45,910 --> 03:09:47,170
Shoot, everybody's dead.

6235
03:09:47,670 --> 03:09:49,250
We have to defend the third...

6236
03:09:49,250 --> 03:09:49,550
Second point.

6237
03:09:49,790 --> 03:09:49,890
Ouch!

6238
03:09:50,770 --> 03:09:51,330
Live!

6239
03:09:51,530 --> 03:09:52,430
Live, Doobie!

6240
03:09:52,490 --> 03:09:53,370
Oh, goodbye, Doobie.

6241
03:09:54,390 --> 03:09:55,670
I defend this.

6242
03:09:56,070 --> 03:09:57,130
Oh my god.

6243
03:09:57,590 --> 03:09:59,470
These guys are so sweaty!

6244
03:10:01,710 --> 03:10:02,270
Yeah.

6245
03:10:02,830 --> 03:10:03,930
They're playing...

6246
03:10:04,690 --> 03:10:07,250
Well, it's mostly meta, except for the Mei.

6247
03:10:07,410 --> 03:10:09,350
But this guy's actually pretty decent at Mei.

6248
03:10:17,990 --> 03:10:19,750
I will ult you.

6249
03:10:21,110 --> 03:10:22,010
I know!

6250
03:10:22,350 --> 03:10:23,250
They're doing so much!

6251
03:10:23,570 --> 03:10:24,390
What is there?

6252
03:10:24,550 --> 03:10:25,430
Oh my god.

6253
03:10:25,650 --> 03:10:26,490
They have so much heals.

6254
03:10:26,730 --> 03:10:28,010
There's a lady behind.

6255
03:10:29,350 --> 03:10:29,950
No!

6256
03:10:30,330 --> 03:10:31,350
Not the woman!

6257
03:10:34,350 --> 03:10:35,150
It's okay.

6258
03:10:35,330 --> 03:10:35,710
I believe.

6259
03:10:35,910 --> 03:10:36,810
I believe.

6260
03:10:37,250 --> 03:10:37,690
It's okay.

6261
03:10:37,690 --> 03:10:37,850
I believe.

6262
03:10:38,170 --> 03:10:38,810
Towering...

6263
03:10:38,810 --> 03:10:39,330
Woman.

6264
03:10:39,930 --> 03:10:40,570
That's...

6265
03:10:40,570 --> 03:10:41,290
Big woman!

6266
03:10:45,650 --> 03:10:46,690
Oh my god.

6267
03:10:46,930 --> 03:10:48,390
The Mercy was so low, too.

6268
03:10:49,130 --> 03:10:51,250
That Juno has so much shield!

6269
03:10:51,910 --> 03:10:53,010
Somebody, please!

6270
03:10:55,330 --> 03:10:57,030
I swear to god.

6271
03:10:58,910 --> 03:10:59,470
Nice.

6272
03:11:00,250 --> 03:11:02,150
Oh no, we lost both supports though.

6273
03:11:02,690 --> 03:11:03,970
And they have both their supports.

6274
03:11:05,910 --> 03:11:06,470
Dammit.

6275
03:11:07,450 --> 03:11:09,310
Oh my god!

6276
03:11:09,830 --> 03:11:10,350
No!

6277
03:11:10,970 --> 03:11:13,130
Our two supports got frozen!

6278
03:11:13,490 --> 03:11:13,750
Yeah!

6279
03:11:15,590 --> 03:11:17,050
I think it's over.

6280
03:11:17,390 --> 03:11:18,230
It's not...

6281
03:11:18,230 --> 03:11:19,370
At least we know it's not us.

6282
03:11:19,430 --> 03:11:19,530
It might.

6283
03:11:21,950 --> 03:11:23,430
No, we're running so low!

6284
03:11:23,830 --> 03:11:24,890
Oh, it's over.

6285
03:11:25,030 --> 03:11:25,930
Now it's over.

6286
03:11:26,230 --> 03:11:28,170
Now it might be over.

6287
03:11:30,030 --> 03:11:30,650
Frick!

6288
03:11:31,050 --> 03:11:31,390
Okay.

6289
03:11:31,730 --> 03:11:31,830
Okay.

6290
03:11:32,170 --> 03:11:33,490
Well, look.

6291
03:11:34,250 --> 03:11:34,670
It's not...

6292
03:11:34,670 --> 03:11:35,710
At least it went by fast.

6293
03:11:35,710 --> 03:11:37,330
Oh no, we have one more round.

6294
03:11:37,470 --> 03:11:37,570
Wait.

6295
03:11:38,030 --> 03:11:39,130
Did they win it, Foley?

6296
03:11:39,270 --> 03:11:40,130
Or do we have one more round?

6297
03:11:40,690 --> 03:11:41,090
Oh...

6298
03:11:41,090 --> 03:11:42,370
Cause like, if they...

6299
03:11:42,370 --> 03:11:43,350
Oh no, they won it.

6300
03:11:43,810 --> 03:11:44,770
Yeah, they got it.

6301
03:11:46,290 --> 03:11:48,190
It makes sense if you win three out of four.

6302
03:11:48,290 --> 03:11:49,770
That you just don't have a chance, right?

6303
03:11:50,090 --> 03:11:51,890
Probably would have won if you're right.

6304
03:11:51,930 --> 03:11:54,290
I said last time, T-back.

6305
03:11:54,730 --> 03:11:55,730
Oh yeah, it's this.

6306
03:11:55,910 --> 03:11:56,550
Yeah, they...

6307
03:11:56,550 --> 03:11:58,770
The maze successfully ulted our...

6308
03:11:58,770 --> 03:11:59,790
Our support.

6309
03:12:01,210 --> 03:12:02,170
That was unlucky.

6310
03:12:03,390 --> 03:12:03,790
Um...

6311
03:12:05,690 --> 03:12:07,430
Was our team T-bagging?

6312
03:12:07,870 --> 03:12:10,030
Yeah, Ryan wasn't protecting us.

6313
03:12:10,150 --> 03:12:11,630
He was just T-bagging.

6314
03:12:12,330 --> 03:12:14,000
Alright, now we can...

6315
03:12:14,430 --> 03:12:14,590
Oh...

6316
03:12:14,590 --> 03:12:15,450
Look like...

6317
03:12:15,450 --> 03:12:17,810
Now we can look at the builds.

6318
03:12:19,850 --> 03:12:20,350
Oh...

6319
03:12:20,350 --> 03:12:20,750
Okay.

6320
03:12:21,370 --> 03:12:22,570
Wait, what's your rank in this?

6321
03:12:23,130 --> 03:12:23,630
Um...

6322
03:12:23,630 --> 03:12:25,690
For support, I'm in the lead right now.

6323
03:12:25,790 --> 03:12:26,690
But we all start in bronze.

6324
03:12:27,450 --> 03:12:27,850
Oh...

6325
03:12:27,850 --> 03:12:29,090
Nevermind, we got a game.

6326
03:12:32,450 --> 03:12:32,850
Nevermind.

6327
03:12:33,230 --> 03:12:33,750
It's okay.

6328
03:12:34,050 --> 03:12:34,270
I...

6329
03:12:34,270 --> 03:12:35,210
I'm getting the hang of it.

6330
03:12:35,850 --> 03:12:36,530
Oh, I'm tank!

6331
03:12:36,530 --> 03:12:38,790
This is kind of whiplash from CS though, I'm not gonna lie.

6332
03:12:38,950 --> 03:12:39,130
Yeah, yeah.

6333
03:12:39,550 --> 03:12:39,950
Oh, nice!

6334
03:12:40,710 --> 03:12:41,170
I'm tank.

6335
03:12:41,390 --> 03:12:41,930
Alright, I'm Zarya.

6336
03:12:41,930 --> 03:12:43,610
All the healing and...

6337
03:12:43,610 --> 03:12:45,070
I'm Zarya now.

6338
03:12:45,670 --> 03:12:46,070
Um...

6339
03:12:46,070 --> 03:12:47,270
I forgot the Zarya build.

6340
03:12:47,330 --> 03:12:49,910
I forgot if I focused on ability power or...

6341
03:12:49,910 --> 03:12:50,630
Weapon power.

6342
03:12:50,830 --> 03:12:51,490
Chat, do you guys remember?

6343
03:12:52,490 --> 03:12:53,370
I don't remember.

6344
03:12:58,640 --> 03:12:59,120
Woo!

6345
03:13:01,120 --> 03:13:02,220
Full weapon power?

6346
03:13:02,380 --> 03:13:02,600
Okay.

6347
03:13:05,260 --> 03:13:08,140
I remember I made like an insane Zarya build.

6348
03:13:08,200 --> 03:13:08,260
Damn.

6349
03:13:10,400 --> 03:13:10,680
Mm.

6350
03:13:11,180 --> 03:13:13,840
I made an insane Zarya build last time I played.

6351
03:13:13,980 --> 03:13:14,700
And it was like...

6352
03:13:14,700 --> 03:13:16,360
I literally was just doing like 80...

6353
03:13:16,360 --> 03:13:17,840
80% plus damage.

6354
03:13:18,000 --> 03:13:19,160
But I don't remember what I did.

6355
03:13:21,620 --> 03:13:22,100
Oh!

6356
03:13:23,640 --> 03:13:24,120
Oh.

6357
03:13:24,120 --> 03:13:27,120
See, in Paladins, I think you can save like your...

6358
03:13:28,120 --> 03:13:29,200
Like your load.

6359
03:13:29,620 --> 03:13:30,940
Also in Deadlock too.

6360
03:13:32,040 --> 03:13:32,720
I hope they do that.

6361
03:13:32,720 --> 03:13:33,540
Did you do something like that for this?

6362
03:13:33,780 --> 03:13:34,220
Yeah.

6363
03:13:35,100 --> 03:13:35,900
Oh, true!

6364
03:13:36,420 --> 03:13:37,200
Everyone could use a little help.

6365
03:13:37,200 --> 03:13:40,420
I heard they're planning on adding like, uh...

6366
03:13:41,980 --> 03:13:42,420
A...

6367
03:13:42,420 --> 03:13:44,300
A top 500 for this too.

6368
03:13:44,460 --> 03:13:46,060
Cause everyone's been enjoying it a lot.

6369
03:13:47,600 --> 03:13:48,040
Oh!

6370
03:13:49,480 --> 03:13:50,440
I mean, it's pretty...

6371
03:13:50,440 --> 03:13:50,780
I like it.

6372
03:13:50,800 --> 03:13:52,020
That'd be a good way to get more people to play.

6373
03:13:52,320 --> 03:13:52,720
Yeah.

6374
03:13:52,720 --> 03:13:53,860
You must choose carefully.

6375
03:13:54,020 --> 03:13:56,260
Yeah, they're saying that Zarya being built would be for next season.

6376
03:13:56,260 --> 03:13:56,500
I don't...

6377
03:13:56,500 --> 03:13:57,400
What's the meatball?

6378
03:13:57,520 --> 03:13:58,040
Where's the meatball?

6379
03:13:58,120 --> 03:13:58,680
Oh, this is...

6380
03:13:58,680 --> 03:13:58,840
Oh.

6381
03:14:00,840 --> 03:14:01,880
Where is the...

6382
03:14:01,880 --> 03:14:03,380
Mini, uh...

6383
03:14:03,380 --> 03:14:05,440
Bear, Nox, Indyla...

6384
03:14:05,440 --> 03:14:05,780
Uh...

6385
03:14:05,780 --> 03:14:06,900
I have their various cast.

6386
03:14:09,800 --> 03:14:10,600
Oh, there's one.

6387
03:14:12,940 --> 03:14:14,060
Yeah, this is what I wanted.

6388
03:14:15,040 --> 03:14:17,100
I can do this, and then...

6389
03:14:17,100 --> 03:14:17,680
There we go.

6390
03:14:17,680 --> 03:14:17,700
There we go.

6391
03:14:21,420 --> 03:14:22,060
That's good.

6392
03:14:22,360 --> 03:14:22,920
I'm glad they're...

6393
03:14:22,920 --> 03:14:23,160
Okay.

6394
03:14:23,160 --> 03:14:24,460
Planning on saving...

6395
03:14:24,460 --> 03:14:25,260
Stuff next to me.

6396
03:14:25,360 --> 03:14:26,760
Alright, I got bubble just...

6397
03:14:26,760 --> 03:14:27,920
Just for you.

6398
03:14:28,180 --> 03:14:28,400
Yes.

6399
03:14:28,400 --> 03:14:29,160
I got bubble.

6400
03:14:29,760 --> 03:14:31,760
So you can take as much damage as you want.

6401
03:14:32,300 --> 03:14:32,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6402
03:14:32,960 --> 03:14:33,480
I'll bubble you.

6403
03:14:33,900 --> 03:14:35,420
I need you to farm...

6404
03:14:35,420 --> 03:14:36,040
Give me damage.

6405
03:14:36,340 --> 03:14:36,500
Okay.

6406
03:14:38,220 --> 03:14:38,920
I believe.

6407
03:14:39,600 --> 03:14:40,360
I believe.

6408
03:14:40,580 --> 03:14:41,200
Go in there.

6409
03:14:41,400 --> 03:14:42,720
Can you bubble my meatball?

6410
03:14:42,720 --> 03:14:43,660
Yeah, I think...

6411
03:14:43,660 --> 03:14:44,500
I'm pretty sure I can.

6412
03:14:45,080 --> 03:14:45,940
You just roll in.

6413
03:14:46,960 --> 03:14:47,620
I wonder...

6414
03:14:47,620 --> 03:14:48,360
While I roll around.

6415
03:14:48,720 --> 03:14:48,840
Yeah.

6416
03:14:48,920 --> 03:14:49,160
Okay.

6417
03:14:49,500 --> 03:14:49,960
Try it.

6418
03:14:50,920 --> 03:14:52,120
Yeah, I don't know how to do it though.

6419
03:14:52,140 --> 03:14:52,680
Is that my ult?

6420
03:14:53,740 --> 03:14:54,220
I know.

6421
03:14:54,320 --> 03:14:54,900
That's your...

6422
03:14:55,760 --> 03:14:56,760
That's your ice cube.

6423
03:14:56,960 --> 03:14:57,360
Yeah.

6424
03:14:59,400 --> 03:15:00,400
That's your ice cube.

6425
03:15:01,320 --> 03:15:01,580
Oh.

6426
03:15:02,160 --> 03:15:03,680
Yeah, so instead of like...

6427
03:15:03,680 --> 03:15:04,240
Stationary.

6428
03:15:04,920 --> 03:15:05,360
You...

6429
03:15:05,880 --> 03:15:06,320
Uh...

6430
03:15:06,320 --> 03:15:07,420
You just go up.

6431
03:15:07,740 --> 03:15:08,800
You just roll over.

6432
03:15:10,160 --> 03:15:10,600
Okay.

6433
03:15:12,360 --> 03:15:12,800
Wait.

6434
03:15:13,240 --> 03:15:14,640
I'm immune in my meatball form anyways.

6435
03:15:14,840 --> 03:15:15,280
Yeah, but...

6436
03:15:15,280 --> 03:15:16,620
Then I get her...

6437
03:15:16,620 --> 03:15:17,900
Damage buildup, right?

6438
03:15:18,020 --> 03:15:18,240
Yeah.

6439
03:15:19,340 --> 03:15:19,960
Okay, never mind.

6440
03:15:20,000 --> 03:15:20,400
Use it.

6441
03:15:22,100 --> 03:15:22,540
I...

6442
03:15:22,540 --> 03:15:23,400
I have one though.

6443
03:15:23,880 --> 03:15:25,460
What the fuck was our Kiriko doing?

6444
03:15:26,200 --> 03:15:26,380
Yeah.

6445
03:15:31,120 --> 03:15:31,800
Oh, no.

6446
03:15:33,340 --> 03:15:33,780
That's...

6447
03:15:33,780 --> 03:15:34,520
It's okay.

6448
03:15:34,940 --> 03:15:36,180
Oh, it's not okay.

6449
03:15:36,360 --> 03:15:37,100
It's not okay.

6450
03:15:37,460 --> 03:15:38,240
But it's okay.

6451
03:15:38,240 --> 03:15:39,300
We have a hundred damage.

6452
03:15:42,000 --> 03:15:42,500
Nice.

6453
03:15:43,020 --> 03:15:43,480
Nice.

6454
03:15:43,740 --> 03:15:44,100
Who's this?

6455
03:15:44,300 --> 03:15:44,680
Who's that?

6456
03:15:47,080 --> 03:15:48,300
Oh, where are you?

6457
03:15:48,520 --> 03:15:48,960
Oh, this is the healer.

6458
03:15:49,080 --> 03:15:49,180
Okay.

6459
03:15:49,440 --> 03:15:50,800
I'm just looking at...

6460
03:15:50,800 --> 03:15:51,780
That's right.

6461
03:15:51,840 --> 03:15:52,960
Get over here, Mercy.

6462
03:15:53,380 --> 03:15:54,260
Heroes because of their skin.

6463
03:15:54,400 --> 03:15:55,880
Get over here, Mercy.

6464
03:15:57,200 --> 03:15:57,700
No!

6465
03:15:58,600 --> 03:15:59,860
Mercy flew away!

6466
03:16:00,160 --> 03:16:01,220
Oh my god!

6467
03:16:01,440 --> 03:16:01,900
Okay, it's fire.

6468
03:16:02,760 --> 03:16:03,260
Plan.

6469
03:16:06,600 --> 03:16:07,480
Definitely plan.

6470
03:16:07,480 --> 03:16:07,840
Alright.

6471
03:16:07,980 --> 03:16:08,300
I'm...

6472
03:16:08,300 --> 03:16:10,360
I'm pushing the payload, so you guys...

6473
03:16:10,360 --> 03:16:10,720
Yep, yep.

6474
03:16:10,920 --> 03:16:11,340
Got it.

6475
03:16:11,800 --> 03:16:11,920
Oh!

6476
03:16:12,180 --> 03:16:12,860
Never mind.

6477
03:16:13,100 --> 03:16:13,700
I exploded.

6478
03:16:14,080 --> 03:16:14,100
Oh shit!

6479
03:16:14,440 --> 03:16:16,640
I may or may not have exploded.

6480
03:16:18,120 --> 03:16:19,060
I think...

6481
03:16:19,060 --> 03:16:21,280
I should not have pushed up there.

6482
03:16:23,540 --> 03:16:24,780
So yeah, I'm coming back.

6483
03:16:28,180 --> 03:16:29,400
I don't know that...

6484
03:16:29,400 --> 03:16:29,740
I don't...

6485
03:16:29,740 --> 03:16:29,960
I don't...

6486
03:16:29,960 --> 03:16:30,060
Okay, wait.

6487
03:16:30,220 --> 03:16:31,240
I'm gonna wait for you to...

6488
03:16:31,240 --> 03:16:32,800
Ice Cube and then I'll...

6489
03:16:32,800 --> 03:16:33,800
I'll bubble you.

6490
03:16:34,800 --> 03:16:36,380
Cuz I don't know that I actually...

6491
03:16:36,380 --> 03:16:37,520
Okay, I'll let you know.

6492
03:16:37,640 --> 03:16:38,460
I'm behind you.

6493
03:16:38,560 --> 03:16:38,860
Okay.

6494
03:16:39,520 --> 03:16:39,880
Okay.

6495
03:16:42,280 --> 03:16:43,400
Cuz I'm saving it.

6496
03:16:43,400 --> 03:16:44,460
Alright, uh...

6497
03:16:44,460 --> 03:16:45,280
Oh yes, I can!

6498
03:16:45,560 --> 03:16:46,200
I can!

6499
03:16:46,520 --> 03:16:46,620
I can!

6500
03:16:46,880 --> 03:16:47,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it does work.

6501
03:16:51,620 --> 03:16:52,700
Oh my god.

6502
03:16:52,940 --> 03:16:53,960
Oh my god.

6503
03:16:54,040 --> 03:16:54,320
Me too.

6504
03:16:57,940 --> 03:16:59,340
Oh my god.

6505
03:16:59,460 --> 03:17:00,420
There's so much.

6506
03:17:00,840 --> 03:17:02,600
There's so much damage.

6507
03:17:02,600 --> 03:17:04,400
There's so much damage.

6508
03:17:04,400 --> 03:17:05,500
There's so much damage.

6509
03:17:06,780 --> 03:17:08,000
Holy shit!

6510
03:17:09,760 --> 03:17:10,520
I...

6511
03:17:11,340 --> 03:17:12,100
I...

6512
03:17:12,360 --> 03:17:13,980
I don't know how I live that long.

6513
03:17:14,580 --> 03:17:14,800
Ah!

6514
03:17:16,740 --> 03:17:18,260
There you guys too!

6515
03:17:18,460 --> 03:17:19,180
Roll away!

6516
03:17:19,580 --> 03:17:21,480
Roll away down to me!

6517
03:17:21,920 --> 03:17:23,680
He almost rolled away!

6518
03:17:25,480 --> 03:17:26,740
It was so close.

6519
03:17:27,400 --> 03:17:29,900
I can't accidentally roll off the edge, can I?

6520
03:17:30,040 --> 03:17:30,660
You can!

6521
03:17:30,660 --> 03:17:31,460
You can!

6522
03:17:31,720 --> 03:17:31,980
You can!

6523
03:17:32,200 --> 03:17:32,740
Absolutely can!

6524
03:17:33,820 --> 03:17:34,460
No!

6525
03:17:35,060 --> 03:17:35,480
Okay.

6526
03:17:36,460 --> 03:17:37,100
Okay.

6527
03:17:37,420 --> 03:17:37,660
Nice.

6528
03:17:37,820 --> 03:17:38,820
I won't come in though.

6529
03:17:39,240 --> 03:17:39,660
Yeah.

6530
03:17:40,220 --> 03:17:41,360
That's so silly.

6531
03:17:42,180 --> 03:17:44,360
That would be so silly if you do.

6532
03:17:44,780 --> 03:17:44,980
Right!

6533
03:17:46,900 --> 03:17:47,540
Okay.

6534
03:17:48,540 --> 03:17:50,140
Oh my god.

6535
03:17:50,160 --> 03:17:50,980
I'm so low.

6536
03:17:51,400 --> 03:17:52,480
I'm so...

6537
03:17:55,320 --> 03:17:56,160
It's okay.

6538
03:17:56,360 --> 03:17:56,860
I just...

6539
03:17:56,860 --> 03:17:57,820
It's overtime, right?

6540
03:17:58,260 --> 03:17:59,120
Oh no.

6541
03:17:59,120 --> 03:18:00,560
We didn't have anyone touching it.

6542
03:18:00,780 --> 03:18:00,800
Oh no, overtime.

6543
03:18:00,920 --> 03:18:01,040
Okay.

6544
03:18:01,120 --> 03:18:01,280
Yeah.

6545
03:18:01,600 --> 03:18:02,120
That's okay.

6546
03:18:02,180 --> 03:18:03,380
We just need...

6547
03:18:04,260 --> 03:18:05,980
I have more points to build.

6548
03:18:06,360 --> 03:18:06,740
More damage.

6549
03:18:08,840 --> 03:18:10,360
And then I'll live forever.

6550
03:18:13,560 --> 03:18:14,000
Yeah.

6551
03:18:14,720 --> 03:18:16,080
Oh shit, my damage is so low.

6552
03:18:17,480 --> 03:18:18,900
You were just rolling around.

6553
03:18:19,980 --> 03:18:21,220
You're too busy rolling.

6554
03:18:21,660 --> 03:18:22,540
No, I wasn't.

6555
03:18:22,820 --> 03:18:23,060
I was...

6556
03:18:23,060 --> 03:18:24,460
I need more power.

6557
03:18:24,880 --> 03:18:25,500
I need more ability.

6558
03:18:26,820 --> 03:18:27,520
I'm gonna see it.

6559
03:18:27,580 --> 03:18:28,040
Do I have enough?

6560
03:18:28,200 --> 03:18:28,660
Oh, five.

6561
03:18:28,840 --> 03:18:29,060
Okay.

6562
03:18:29,540 --> 03:18:30,440
Oh, I need the cooldown.

6563
03:18:30,940 --> 03:18:31,600
Cooldown reduction.

6564
03:18:32,800 --> 03:18:33,340
Uh...

6565
03:18:33,340 --> 03:18:34,020
I'll get that.

6566
03:18:34,920 --> 03:18:35,400
I'll get that.

6567
03:18:35,400 --> 03:18:35,920
Oh yeah, I remember.

6568
03:18:36,060 --> 03:18:36,980
It was cooldown reduction.

6569
03:18:37,520 --> 03:18:37,880
And...

6570
03:18:37,880 --> 03:18:38,720
Weapon power.

6571
03:18:40,620 --> 03:18:41,740
Just lock in.

6572
03:18:41,940 --> 03:18:42,600
Just that easy.

6573
03:18:42,720 --> 03:18:43,320
Just lock in.

6574
03:18:44,960 --> 03:18:46,240
I believe, BB.

6575
03:18:46,860 --> 03:18:47,680
I believe.

6576
03:18:48,960 --> 03:18:49,480
Okay.

6577
03:18:50,660 --> 03:18:51,020
Oop!

6578
03:18:53,000 --> 03:18:53,360
Oop!

6579
03:18:53,600 --> 03:18:53,780
Oop!

6580
03:18:53,780 --> 03:18:54,080
Boop!

6581
03:18:55,820 --> 03:18:56,580
Rolling, rolling.

6582
03:18:56,920 --> 03:18:56,980
Hey!

6583
03:19:00,470 --> 03:19:01,250
Check this out.

6584
03:19:02,010 --> 03:19:02,250
Woah.

6585
03:19:03,070 --> 03:19:03,730
Oh my God.

6586
03:19:04,050 --> 03:19:04,690
Look at you roll.

6587
03:19:05,090 --> 03:19:06,330
Oh wait, you can use that...

6588
03:19:06,330 --> 03:19:06,530
You...

6589
03:19:06,530 --> 03:19:08,270
You know you can use that to boot people as well.

6590
03:19:10,310 --> 03:19:10,930
Oh, really?

6591
03:19:11,150 --> 03:19:11,510
Like...

6592
03:19:11,510 --> 03:19:12,830
Push them off the map?

6593
03:19:13,010 --> 03:19:13,730
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6594
03:19:13,990 --> 03:19:15,190
I mean, if you're next to it.

6595
03:19:15,690 --> 03:19:16,230
Wait, no.

6596
03:19:16,310 --> 03:19:17,510
You're just trying to trick me, aren't you?

6597
03:19:17,710 --> 03:19:18,250
No, no.

6598
03:19:18,310 --> 03:19:19,390
I would never.

6599
03:19:22,290 --> 03:19:25,170
I would never do such a thing.

6600
03:19:25,990 --> 03:19:27,890
Doobie, do you trust me?

6601
03:19:29,550 --> 03:19:30,510
Yeah, I'll try it.

6602
03:19:30,530 --> 03:19:33,070
Well, I don't know if this map is anywhere to push people.

6603
03:19:35,190 --> 03:19:36,650
I have no idea what this map is.

6604
03:19:36,790 --> 03:19:37,510
I've never seen it before.

6605
03:19:38,790 --> 03:19:40,590
Okay, I got a lot of energy to go.

6606
03:19:41,730 --> 03:19:42,070
Okay.

6607
03:19:45,910 --> 03:19:46,310
Nice.

6608
03:19:46,490 --> 03:19:46,910
I have a hundred.

6609
03:19:49,690 --> 03:19:50,930
I'm gonna... Oh, wait.

6610
03:19:51,150 --> 03:19:52,090
It killed our Mercy.

6611
03:19:53,570 --> 03:19:54,270
Oh, no.

6612
03:19:54,970 --> 03:19:55,270
Oh, no.

6613
03:19:55,390 --> 03:19:55,630
No!

6614
03:19:56,130 --> 03:19:57,470
Our entire team's dead!

6615
03:19:59,450 --> 03:20:00,510
It's not our fault.

6616
03:20:00,770 --> 03:20:01,430
It's not us.

6617
03:20:01,670 --> 03:20:02,470
It's not us.

6618
03:20:04,990 --> 03:20:07,270
Our Mercy died first, so it can't be us.

6619
03:20:07,530 --> 03:20:08,450
Yeah, true.

6620
03:20:08,650 --> 03:20:10,350
Okay, well, how did they die?

6621
03:20:10,610 --> 03:20:12,830
I think that Ryan just walked up to her.

6622
03:20:12,830 --> 03:20:17,890
I... I have... Literally just W, Keeter.

6623
03:20:17,890 --> 03:20:18,990
I'll stay near the first knee.

6624
03:20:19,190 --> 03:20:20,390
I'll try to help her.

6625
03:20:20,510 --> 03:20:22,030
Literally just W, Keeter.

6626
03:20:25,650 --> 03:20:28,710
I should, like, actually maybe use my...

6627
03:20:30,030 --> 03:20:33,670
...my shield to help my team instead of to work for myself.

6628
03:20:34,030 --> 03:20:36,230
I'm a little selfish with my abilities.

6629
03:20:36,730 --> 03:20:37,350
Ow!

6630
03:20:39,590 --> 03:20:41,090
Oh, my God.

6631
03:20:43,590 --> 03:20:45,690
I can't... I can't push up.

6632
03:20:45,750 --> 03:20:46,590
I'm so low.

6633
03:20:46,850 --> 03:20:47,790
Oh, you're so low.

6634
03:20:48,050 --> 03:20:49,190
I'm so low.

6635
03:20:50,070 --> 03:20:51,350
Please help me.

6636
03:20:53,570 --> 03:20:54,750
Oh, I couldn't.

6637
03:20:54,970 --> 03:20:57,130
I... Oh, he was one.

6638
03:20:58,030 --> 03:21:00,030
I was just about to shield it.

6639
03:21:00,410 --> 03:21:02,390
I knew he got shattered, too.

6640
03:21:04,270 --> 03:21:06,230
If it was one second faster.

6641
03:21:06,230 --> 03:21:07,450
Do I just, like, bounce one as Mei?

6642
03:21:08,410 --> 03:21:09,090
I didn't know.

6643
03:21:09,230 --> 03:21:09,650
I think maybe?

6644
03:21:09,650 --> 03:21:11,530
I just freeze only, pretty much.

6645
03:21:11,730 --> 03:21:13,230
Oh, her freeze is a slow, though.

6646
03:21:14,270 --> 03:21:15,230
Her freeze is just a slow.

6647
03:21:17,030 --> 03:21:17,970
Oh, no, there's a bomb.

6648
03:21:18,330 --> 03:21:18,810
It doesn't do damage?

6649
03:21:19,370 --> 03:21:21,850
It does, but, like, it doesn't freeze anymore.

6650
03:21:23,290 --> 03:21:24,190
Oh, yeah.

6651
03:21:24,210 --> 03:21:24,210
Oh, yeah.

6652
03:21:24,490 --> 03:21:24,710
Yeah.

6653
03:21:26,810 --> 03:21:27,590
All right.

6654
03:21:27,950 --> 03:21:28,850
Can anybody touch?

6655
03:21:30,210 --> 03:21:30,790
Oh...

6656
03:21:30,790 --> 03:21:32,090
It's okay.

6657
03:21:32,290 --> 03:21:33,550
This is where we turn it around.

6658
03:21:33,870 --> 03:21:34,730
This is where...

6659
03:21:36,130 --> 03:21:36,530
Yeah!

6660
03:21:37,070 --> 03:21:38,030
Yeah, right here.

6661
03:21:38,210 --> 03:21:39,010
This is our chance.

6662
03:21:39,210 --> 03:21:40,070
This is our chance.

6663
03:21:40,270 --> 03:21:42,090
We turn it around right here.

6664
03:21:44,730 --> 03:21:45,490
Doki on tank.

6665
03:21:45,670 --> 03:21:45,990
Is she okay?

6666
03:21:46,130 --> 03:21:48,230
Zarya is, like, not really a tank, though.

6667
03:21:48,430 --> 03:21:50,250
She's, like, she's an off tank, so...

6668
03:21:50,250 --> 03:21:53,430
It's, like, more, uh...

6669
03:21:54,230 --> 03:21:54,630
Damage?

6670
03:21:55,030 --> 03:21:56,130
More damage, yeah.

6671
03:21:56,310 --> 03:21:57,310
She doesn't feel like a tank.

6672
03:21:57,490 --> 03:21:58,310
That's why I like playing her.

6673
03:21:58,310 --> 03:21:58,330
Okay.

6674
03:21:59,710 --> 03:22:02,130
I don't remember what this... What do I do for this?

6675
03:22:04,250 --> 03:22:06,550
King, weapon, lifesteal, ability?

6676
03:22:07,410 --> 03:22:07,970
Oh!

6677
03:22:09,350 --> 03:22:10,910
Wait, is lifesteal good?

6678
03:22:15,860 --> 03:22:17,080
That's what do I do?

6679
03:22:21,660 --> 03:22:22,500
At chat.

6680
03:22:23,120 --> 03:22:24,480
At chat's my grok now.

6681
03:22:27,420 --> 03:22:29,120
At chat, what do I do?

6682
03:22:36,620 --> 03:22:37,140
Uh...

6683
03:22:39,400 --> 03:22:41,840
Do I do weapon, lifesteal, or...?

6684
03:22:44,720 --> 03:22:45,240
Pierce.

6685
03:22:48,400 --> 03:22:49,760
I'll do lifesteal.

6686
03:22:49,920 --> 03:22:50,280
I'm ready.

6687
03:22:50,280 --> 03:22:50,600
I got it.

6688
03:22:50,720 --> 03:22:51,340
I'm ready, too.

6689
03:22:55,820 --> 03:22:56,340
Alright.

6690
03:22:56,620 --> 03:22:57,260
I'm ready.

6691
03:22:57,720 --> 03:22:58,780
We got this.

6692
03:23:00,360 --> 03:23:00,880
Pierce.

6693
03:23:01,180 --> 03:23:01,400
Yeah!

6694
03:23:01,680 --> 03:23:02,900
I haven't played this game mode.

6695
03:23:06,180 --> 03:23:09,340
Okay, I'm just gonna use my bubbles for my...

6696
03:23:09,340 --> 03:23:10,560
Oh my god!

6697
03:23:11,420 --> 03:23:14,440
R&T fucking died so fast.

6698
03:23:14,780 --> 03:23:15,540
That's crazy.

6699
03:23:17,940 --> 03:23:20,120
Well, she shouldn't be out there like that, right?

6700
03:23:20,260 --> 03:23:21,740
Yeah, like...

6701
03:23:21,740 --> 03:23:22,820
That...

6702
03:23:23,580 --> 03:23:24,500
That was sad.

6703
03:23:25,800 --> 03:23:28,920
Okay, I have a hundred, but like, I'm a little worried though.

6704
03:23:29,560 --> 03:23:30,400
Okay, we got him.

6705
03:23:30,680 --> 03:23:31,060
That's...

6706
03:23:31,060 --> 03:23:32,240
JK, I'm not worried anymore.

6707
03:23:32,440 --> 03:23:32,660
Okay.

6708
03:23:34,360 --> 03:23:35,580
We got it, we got it.

6709
03:23:35,760 --> 03:23:36,480
We got it, yeah.

6710
03:23:36,700 --> 03:23:37,740
I think we needed those...

6711
03:23:37,740 --> 03:23:40,280
The second ability power-ups for some of our team.

6712
03:23:40,700 --> 03:23:40,800
Yeah.

6713
03:23:40,960 --> 03:23:41,940
Yeah, we definitely did.

6714
03:23:42,380 --> 03:23:45,660
Also, I just realized our Kyoko is mostly DPSing, so...

6715
03:23:48,300 --> 03:23:50,040
Ohhhh, that explains a lot.

6716
03:23:50,780 --> 03:23:51,080
Yeah.

6717
03:23:51,660 --> 03:23:53,660
Yeah, I just see her like, literally just there.

6718
03:23:54,540 --> 03:23:55,260
DPSing a lot.

6719
03:23:58,620 --> 03:23:59,860
Oh, nobody's shooting me.

6720
03:24:00,320 --> 03:24:00,760
I like that.

6721
03:24:06,640 --> 03:24:07,820
Oh, he's so low.

6722
03:24:10,780 --> 03:24:11,560
What the fuck?

6723
03:24:11,580 --> 03:24:11,720
Did they die?

6724
03:24:11,840 --> 03:24:12,240
Oh yeah, they did.

6725
03:24:12,340 --> 03:24:12,520
Nice.

6726
03:24:12,580 --> 03:24:13,380
Where is everybody?

6727
03:24:14,420 --> 03:24:15,500
There's somebody here.

6728
03:24:15,940 --> 03:24:16,200
Where?

6729
03:24:16,260 --> 03:24:16,760
Oh, never mind.

6730
03:24:16,940 --> 03:24:17,040
Wait.

6731
03:24:17,040 --> 03:24:17,400
Where's here?

6732
03:24:21,420 --> 03:24:22,460
I got confused.

6733
03:24:23,660 --> 03:24:24,380
Oh, nice.

6734
03:24:24,480 --> 03:24:24,840
Nice shield.

6735
03:24:25,460 --> 03:24:25,880
Or nice wall.

6736
03:24:28,060 --> 03:24:29,280
Wait, where did I shot?

6737
03:24:30,140 --> 03:24:30,800
That's right.

6738
03:24:31,200 --> 03:24:31,900
Fuck you.

6739
03:24:35,860 --> 03:24:36,600
Oh, nice.

6740
03:24:36,600 --> 03:24:37,060
I got him.

6741
03:24:37,160 --> 03:24:38,420
I got him before...

6742
03:24:38,420 --> 03:24:38,820
Oh, nice.

6743
03:24:38,880 --> 03:24:39,560
I got a rise, too.

6744
03:24:40,140 --> 03:24:40,240
Oh.

6745
03:24:40,580 --> 03:24:41,640
You won't!

6746
03:24:41,800 --> 03:24:42,780
You won't!

6747
03:24:43,120 --> 03:24:43,260
You won't!

6748
03:24:43,260 --> 03:24:44,220
You won't!

6749
03:24:44,220 --> 03:24:45,900
Stop the risk!

6750
03:24:46,040 --> 03:24:47,280
Okay, that was funny, though.

6751
03:24:48,520 --> 03:24:49,320
Wait, what?

6752
03:24:50,000 --> 03:24:51,600
I thought she was on the other side.

6753
03:24:51,880 --> 03:24:59,160
No, you walled it, so the wall made her go up, so then it was out of range for the rest.

6754
03:24:59,620 --> 03:25:00,400
That was funny.

6755
03:25:00,740 --> 03:25:01,920
I saw it live, too.

6756
03:25:05,640 --> 03:25:06,660
You didn't know.

6757
03:25:06,840 --> 03:25:07,620
You didn't know.

6758
03:25:20,560 --> 03:25:38,240
Oh my god, mercy, please!

6759
03:25:38,240 --> 03:25:38,520
What is this?

6760
03:25:38,640 --> 03:25:39,900
I'm so resable!

6761
03:25:42,860 --> 03:25:46,140
Yeah, I like the meatball roll from Doobie too.

6762
03:25:46,700 --> 03:25:47,800
It's so silly.

6763
03:25:47,940 --> 03:25:50,020
Yeah, I like pushing people.

6764
03:25:50,600 --> 03:25:51,460
It's fun.

6765
03:25:52,800 --> 03:25:54,460
Yeah, it's so silly.

6766
03:25:54,600 --> 03:25:56,160
It's such a silly ability.

6767
03:25:58,000 --> 03:26:00,080
Alright, I'm gonna back out.

6768
03:26:00,560 --> 03:26:02,940
I don't wanna get involved with that.

6769
03:26:03,240 --> 03:26:03,800
Not gonna lie.

6770
03:26:06,140 --> 03:26:07,560
Okay, I have shield.

6771
03:26:13,110 --> 03:26:14,670
Alright, go meatball, go!

6772
03:26:17,090 --> 03:26:18,370
No, this is calculated.

6773
03:26:18,530 --> 03:26:19,250
I'm holding them off.

6774
03:26:20,470 --> 03:26:20,870
Yeah.

6775
03:26:23,050 --> 03:26:24,510
Okay, I knew he was gonna do that.

6776
03:26:25,670 --> 03:26:26,410
Oh my god.

6777
03:26:26,570 --> 03:26:27,170
Oh my god.

6778
03:26:27,270 --> 03:26:28,010
Please, please.

6779
03:26:28,290 --> 03:26:28,690
No!

6780
03:26:31,550 --> 03:26:32,330
Oh, we won it!

6781
03:26:32,450 --> 03:26:32,970
Oh, they got us!

6782
03:26:33,010 --> 03:26:33,590
They see that!

6783
03:26:33,770 --> 03:26:34,550
They see that!

6784
03:26:34,770 --> 03:26:35,410
Let's go!

6785
03:26:36,770 --> 03:26:37,910
I pushed them!

6786
03:26:38,210 --> 03:26:38,430
Yay!

6787
03:26:39,210 --> 03:26:40,450
I saw the C9.

6788
03:26:41,290 --> 03:26:41,690
Woohoo!

6789
03:26:42,430 --> 03:26:45,670
They all like ran to me and you walled them off.

6790
03:26:46,270 --> 03:26:47,130
Oh my god.

6791
03:26:47,490 --> 03:26:47,990
Yes, guys.

6792
03:26:48,310 --> 03:26:48,830
Look at that.

6793
03:26:49,090 --> 03:26:49,190
See?

6794
03:26:49,330 --> 03:26:49,950
Wait, so that's good?

6795
03:26:50,230 --> 03:26:50,890
Yeah, that's good.

6796
03:26:50,970 --> 03:26:51,390
Good wall?

6797
03:26:51,630 --> 03:26:52,530
Yeah, that was a good wall.

6798
03:26:52,750 --> 03:26:56,210
They all like ran to me and they couldn't get back to the actual...

6799
03:26:56,210 --> 03:26:57,370
actual point.

6800
03:26:57,850 --> 03:26:59,430
Okay, weapon power.

6801
03:26:59,830 --> 03:27:00,510
Okay.

6802
03:27:01,710 --> 03:27:03,990
What would my ability power do?

6803
03:27:04,110 --> 03:27:06,050
I should get like cooldown reduction actually.

6804
03:27:07,430 --> 03:27:08,850
No, I'll just go all in.

6805
03:27:08,870 --> 03:27:09,590
Weapon power.

6806
03:27:11,590 --> 03:27:12,030
Alright.

6807
03:27:13,750 --> 03:27:14,530
Look at this.

6808
03:27:15,130 --> 03:27:16,250
D&D on top.

6809
03:27:17,190 --> 03:27:17,330
Wait.

6810
03:27:19,590 --> 03:27:20,510
Wait, which one is...

6811
03:27:20,510 --> 03:27:22,010
Oh, I can get more meatball.

6812
03:27:22,530 --> 03:27:23,310
Oh, that's true.

6813
03:27:23,610 --> 03:27:26,510
You can do like cooldown reduction so you can meatball all the time.

6814
03:27:26,510 --> 03:27:26,990
Yeah.

6815
03:27:29,830 --> 03:27:30,430
Shoot.

6816
03:27:30,750 --> 03:27:31,350
Unlimited.

6817
03:27:31,710 --> 03:27:31,890
I don't think I have that one.

6818
03:27:32,310 --> 03:27:33,370
Unlimited meatballs.

6819
03:27:33,950 --> 03:27:35,610
Wait, where's cooldown reduction?

6820
03:27:36,070 --> 03:27:36,410
Let me see.

6821
03:27:36,530 --> 03:27:38,530
There should be an ability power and weapon power.

6822
03:27:40,030 --> 03:27:40,550
It's called...

6823
03:27:40,550 --> 03:27:41,370
It's in the rare.

6824
03:27:42,430 --> 03:27:44,690
Um, the rare one is multi-tool.

6825
03:27:45,390 --> 03:27:45,450
Oh.

6826
03:27:45,450 --> 03:27:47,090
And, uh, icy coolant.

6827
03:27:47,290 --> 03:27:49,790
Second row blue for weapon and ability.

6828
03:27:52,430 --> 03:27:53,030
Okay.

6829
03:27:53,170 --> 03:27:53,610
Oh, I see.

6830
03:27:54,190 --> 03:27:54,790
Three.

6831
03:27:55,330 --> 03:27:55,650
Two.

6832
03:27:56,510 --> 03:27:56,910
One.

6833
03:27:57,250 --> 03:27:57,850
Zero.

6834
03:27:59,170 --> 03:27:59,530
Okay.

6835
03:27:59,910 --> 03:28:00,730
Alright, we got this.

6836
03:28:00,890 --> 03:28:01,610
I believe.

6837
03:28:03,430 --> 03:28:04,610
Unlimited meatballs.

6838
03:28:05,310 --> 03:28:05,750
Yeah.

6839
03:28:05,970 --> 03:28:06,410
I believe.

6840
03:28:06,530 --> 03:28:06,770
Meatballed.

6841
03:28:09,070 --> 03:28:09,790
Alright.

6842
03:28:11,230 --> 03:28:12,510
I'm moving up.

6843
03:28:14,150 --> 03:28:14,850
Wee.

6844
03:28:15,190 --> 03:28:16,250
My god, soldier.

6845
03:28:16,630 --> 03:28:19,310
You're gonna fucking insta-die if you run like that.

6846
03:28:20,490 --> 03:28:21,550
In three.

6847
03:28:21,930 --> 03:28:22,350
Two.

6848
03:28:22,770 --> 03:28:23,090
Oh.

6849
03:28:23,450 --> 03:28:24,710
I can't go!

6850
03:28:25,590 --> 03:28:26,310
Why?!

6851
03:28:26,690 --> 03:28:26,970
You're...

6852
03:28:26,970 --> 03:28:26,990
Which...

6853
03:28:27,530 --> 03:28:27,810
Rated.

6854
03:28:29,690 --> 03:28:30,230
Oh, nice.

6855
03:28:30,470 --> 03:28:30,950
That's such a good.

6856
03:28:31,430 --> 03:28:31,710
Aw.

6857
03:28:31,930 --> 03:28:32,110
Nice.

6858
03:28:32,210 --> 03:28:32,430
I got him.

6859
03:28:32,470 --> 03:28:32,670
I got him.

6860
03:28:32,730 --> 03:28:32,930
I got him.

6861
03:28:34,610 --> 03:28:34,890
Nice.

6862
03:28:35,070 --> 03:28:35,370
B buff.

6863
03:28:38,510 --> 03:28:38,970
That's right.

6864
03:28:39,090 --> 03:28:39,350
Mercy.

6865
03:28:41,750 --> 03:28:42,650
I got her.

6866
03:28:46,770 --> 03:28:48,250
Oh no, Murky.

6867
03:28:48,950 --> 03:28:49,530
Murky.

6868
03:28:50,490 --> 03:28:52,770
Murky, Murky, Murky, Murky, please.

6869
03:28:53,870 --> 03:28:55,810
Please heal our Kiriko dead.

6870
03:28:58,590 --> 03:28:59,930
Please, hit me.

6871
03:29:00,270 --> 03:29:01,050
Hit me.

6872
03:29:02,310 --> 03:29:02,890
Nice.

6873
03:29:03,370 --> 03:29:04,290
Oh, I got him, I got him.

6874
03:29:04,970 --> 03:29:05,590
Nice teamwork.

6875
03:29:09,730 --> 03:29:10,170
Nice.

6876
03:29:10,170 --> 03:29:10,950
Come on.

6877
03:29:11,550 --> 03:29:11,990
Nice.

6878
03:29:13,190 --> 03:29:14,070
Is this a real?

6879
03:29:14,290 --> 03:29:14,710
Are you real?

6880
03:29:14,810 --> 03:29:15,390
Yeah, you're real.

6881
03:29:16,630 --> 03:29:21,310
So, Kiriko has a build where she can send to a clone of her.

6882
03:29:22,970 --> 03:29:25,150
I didn't know which one was the real one.

6883
03:29:25,290 --> 03:29:25,590
Oh, okay.

6884
03:29:26,150 --> 03:29:27,990
That's why I always see Kiriko dying.

6885
03:29:28,510 --> 03:29:29,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6886
03:29:29,190 --> 03:29:31,210
Does her clone show up in the feed?

6887
03:29:31,430 --> 03:29:32,930
Yeah, her clone shows up too.

6888
03:29:34,130 --> 03:29:35,490
Oh, wait, yes!

6889
03:29:35,690 --> 03:29:36,450
You blocked him!

6890
03:29:38,050 --> 03:29:39,690
We both body blocked him.

6891
03:29:40,030 --> 03:29:40,870
This is it.

6892
03:29:42,770 --> 03:29:43,710
Okay, let's go.

6893
03:29:44,550 --> 03:29:46,530
Good job, Melon Make Milkers.

6894
03:29:46,850 --> 03:29:48,510
Um, it's best of four.

6895
03:29:49,350 --> 03:29:50,830
We go to four rounds.

6896
03:29:51,050 --> 03:29:52,730
Like, whoever wins four rounds, basically.

6897
03:29:53,370 --> 03:29:54,490
It's not best of four.

6898
03:29:54,830 --> 03:29:56,130
I don't know numbers.

6899
03:29:57,650 --> 03:29:59,370
Oh, now we can do more builds.

6900
03:30:07,190 --> 03:30:08,250
There's a cast.

6901
03:30:08,830 --> 03:30:10,110
One additional ally.

6902
03:30:10,330 --> 03:30:10,470
Oh!

6903
03:30:11,250 --> 03:30:11,530
Yeah!

6904
03:30:13,890 --> 03:30:15,330
I want over healthy.

6905
03:30:16,610 --> 03:30:18,850
Oh yeah, we have Melon Milkers and Booba.

6906
03:30:19,190 --> 03:30:20,090
You're right, chat.

6907
03:30:26,500 --> 03:30:27,000
Perfect.

6908
03:30:27,640 --> 03:30:28,020
Yeah.

6909
03:30:28,300 --> 03:30:29,540
Of course, Mercy's the...

6910
03:30:30,840 --> 03:30:31,840
Melon Milkers.

6911
03:30:32,120 --> 03:30:33,180
I want to do...

6912
03:30:34,880 --> 03:30:37,460
I want to do it so, like, we have double shields.

6913
03:30:38,240 --> 03:30:38,480
Oh!

6914
03:30:43,700 --> 03:30:44,660
We got this.

6915
03:30:44,820 --> 03:30:46,540
See, the more points we build...

6916
03:30:47,520 --> 03:30:50,480
The more points we have, the more we can build better stuff.

6917
03:30:52,440 --> 03:30:54,120
And it can change the game.

6918
03:30:57,040 --> 03:30:57,440
Yay!

6919
03:30:58,820 --> 03:31:00,060
We got this, I believe.

6920
03:31:00,360 --> 03:31:00,900
Oh, okay.

6921
03:31:01,340 --> 03:31:02,260
I believe in us, doobie.

6922
03:31:02,260 --> 03:31:03,760
Wait, my chat is telling me to buy...

6923
03:31:03,760 --> 03:31:04,560
I don't know how to do this.

6924
03:31:05,780 --> 03:31:07,000
So much information.

6925
03:31:08,540 --> 03:31:08,940
Fuck!

6926
03:31:10,080 --> 03:31:10,480
No!

6927
03:31:10,980 --> 03:31:11,460
Did you get it?

6928
03:31:11,540 --> 03:31:11,780
I don't know.

6929
03:31:12,200 --> 03:31:12,940
Shit, I don't know.

6930
03:31:13,000 --> 03:31:13,300
Sorry.

6931
03:31:15,040 --> 03:31:15,900
Uh, yeah.

6932
03:31:16,200 --> 03:31:17,620
Yeah, we totally got it.

6933
03:31:17,640 --> 03:31:18,100
I think it's fine.

6934
03:31:18,480 --> 03:31:19,500
Yeah, yeah, we're so...

6935
03:31:19,500 --> 03:31:20,080
We're healthy.

6936
03:31:21,880 --> 03:31:22,360
Oh...

6937
03:31:22,360 --> 03:31:23,120
Oh my god.

6938
03:31:23,380 --> 03:31:24,960
I have 70% ability power.

6939
03:31:24,960 --> 03:31:26,940
So, I should sell my green ones to buy purple ones.

6940
03:31:27,000 --> 03:31:27,280
Oh, yeah.

6941
03:31:27,420 --> 03:31:27,780
Okay.

6942
03:31:28,420 --> 03:31:29,180
I wasn't looking.

6943
03:31:29,320 --> 03:31:29,940
You have no tank.

6944
03:31:31,660 --> 03:31:32,920
No tanks, by the way.

6945
03:31:33,420 --> 03:31:33,520
Oh.

6946
03:31:35,040 --> 03:31:35,520
Oh.

6947
03:31:37,180 --> 03:31:37,660
Oh.

6948
03:31:38,340 --> 03:31:39,160
That's awkward.

6949
03:31:39,600 --> 03:31:40,760
Oh, we lost our Mercy.

6950
03:31:41,080 --> 03:31:42,640
Yeah, we sort of heavily...

6951
03:31:42,640 --> 03:31:44,360
Oh, we lost everybody?

6952
03:31:46,540 --> 03:31:47,320
Hey, don't...

6953
03:31:47,320 --> 03:31:47,560
Oh!

6954
03:31:47,640 --> 03:31:48,220
Oh my god!

6955
03:31:48,340 --> 03:31:49,320
That's what a ride was!

6956
03:31:49,460 --> 03:31:49,720
Goodbye!

6957
03:31:51,120 --> 03:31:52,220
I got you, I got you!

6958
03:31:53,800 --> 03:31:54,780
I got you again!

6959
03:31:55,000 --> 03:31:55,900
I don't got you again!

6960
03:31:56,040 --> 03:31:56,640
I don't got you again!

6961
03:31:56,800 --> 03:31:57,120
I don't got you again!

6962
03:32:02,460 --> 03:32:04,260
Bro, that guy chased you everywhere!

6963
03:32:04,260 --> 03:32:05,560
I was scared of jumping off.

6964
03:32:05,720 --> 03:32:06,740
But maybe I should've jumped.

6965
03:32:07,580 --> 03:32:08,380
Oh my...

6966
03:32:08,380 --> 03:32:09,700
Bro, that guy followed you.

6967
03:32:09,720 --> 03:32:10,580
They hate me.

6968
03:32:10,580 --> 03:32:11,120
My meatball.

6969
03:32:11,720 --> 03:32:13,840
They really didn't like your meatball though.

6970
03:32:15,900 --> 03:32:16,600
Oh my god.

6971
03:32:16,740 --> 03:32:17,400
Oh my god.

6972
03:32:17,480 --> 03:32:18,280
I'm alive somehow.

6973
03:32:18,480 --> 03:32:19,100
I don't know how.

6974
03:32:19,260 --> 03:32:19,780
I'm alive.

6975
03:32:21,460 --> 03:32:21,860
Okay.

6976
03:32:22,220 --> 03:32:22,600
Nice.

6977
03:32:22,600 --> 03:32:23,580
I'm pushing up.

6978
03:32:23,920 --> 03:32:25,000
I'm pushing up.

6979
03:32:25,560 --> 03:32:26,680
Ha, ha, ha.

6980
03:32:26,960 --> 03:32:27,560
Ha, ha.

6981
03:32:31,460 --> 03:32:32,000
Ha, ha.

6982
03:32:32,000 --> 03:32:32,220
Ha, ha.

6983
03:32:32,780 --> 03:32:32,860
Ha, ha.

6984
03:32:33,800 --> 03:32:34,660
Oh my god.

6985
03:32:34,800 --> 03:32:35,660
There's so many things.

6986
03:32:36,800 --> 03:32:37,980
Okay, I'm capping point though.

6987
03:32:38,940 --> 03:32:39,600
That's right.

6988
03:32:39,800 --> 03:32:40,860
Give me my energy!

6989
03:32:41,220 --> 03:32:41,240
Okay.

6990
03:32:41,440 --> 03:32:42,760
The healers are back here, distracted.

6991
03:32:43,600 --> 03:32:44,120
Yeah, that's good.

6992
03:32:44,720 --> 03:32:45,860
Are they still distracted?

6993
03:32:47,820 --> 03:32:48,260
Cold.

6994
03:32:48,920 --> 03:32:49,320
Uh, yeah.

6995
03:32:49,460 --> 03:32:50,300
I walled off kind of.

6996
03:32:51,000 --> 03:32:51,440
Free.

6997
03:32:51,940 --> 03:32:52,460
Oh, yes.

6998
03:32:52,600 --> 03:32:52,860
Poop him!

6999
03:32:52,980 --> 03:32:53,240
Poop him!

7000
03:32:54,560 --> 03:32:55,160
Poop him!

7001
03:32:55,340 --> 03:32:56,060
He hates us!

7002
03:32:58,360 --> 03:32:59,400
Ha, ha, ha!

7003
03:33:00,400 --> 03:33:01,480
Ha, ha, ha!

7004
03:33:02,040 --> 03:33:02,520
Ha, ha, ha!

7005
03:33:02,760 --> 03:33:03,260
Ha, ha, ha!

7006
03:33:03,260 --> 03:33:03,300
Ha, ha, ha!

7007
03:33:03,500 --> 03:33:03,780
Woohoo!

7008
03:33:04,280 --> 03:33:04,760
We're doing it!

7009
03:33:07,680 --> 03:33:08,120
Okay.

7010
03:33:08,560 --> 03:33:10,500
I have so much energy right now.

7011
03:33:10,720 --> 03:33:11,840
It's actually crazy.

7012
03:33:13,600 --> 03:33:14,740
Are you okay over there?

7013
03:33:15,560 --> 03:33:16,440
Oh, we lost.

7014
03:33:16,660 --> 03:33:17,660
Yeah, we lost him.

7015
03:33:17,800 --> 03:33:18,980
Why was he over there though?

7016
03:33:19,600 --> 03:33:20,000
Uh...

7017
03:33:20,520 --> 03:33:21,800
What the fuck is he doing?

7018
03:33:21,940 --> 03:33:22,920
Oh my god!

7019
03:33:23,060 --> 03:33:23,780
What the...

7020
03:33:23,780 --> 03:33:23,880
Oh.

7021
03:33:24,080 --> 03:33:25,600
I think he was trying to kill Svolger.

7022
03:33:26,620 --> 03:33:27,860
Okay, I have...

7023
03:33:28,700 --> 03:33:29,360
Oh, nice.

7024
03:33:29,360 --> 03:33:30,240
That's a good freeze.

7025
03:33:33,120 --> 03:33:33,520
Nice.

7026
03:33:36,260 --> 03:33:37,200
That's a fucking...

7027
03:33:37,200 --> 03:33:38,300
Did I kill him with my meatball?

7028
03:33:38,480 --> 03:33:39,080
I think I might have.

7029
03:33:39,140 --> 03:33:39,520
Oh, yeah, yeah.

7030
03:33:39,520 --> 03:33:40,280
Yeah.

7031
03:33:41,620 --> 03:33:42,500
You're walled up.

7032
03:33:42,700 --> 03:33:42,860
Sorry.

7033
03:33:43,040 --> 03:33:43,580
No, it's fine.

7034
03:33:43,720 --> 03:33:44,140
I'm okay.

7035
03:33:46,520 --> 03:33:47,440
Oh my god.

7036
03:33:47,660 --> 03:33:48,500
We're figuring it out.

7037
03:33:48,720 --> 03:33:50,100
We know how to play our comp now.

7038
03:33:51,220 --> 03:33:52,440
What the fuck are these guys doing?

7039
03:33:52,580 --> 03:33:52,740
Yeah.

7040
03:33:54,880 --> 03:33:55,280
Come on.

7041
03:33:55,380 --> 03:33:56,280
I know you have a...

7042
03:33:56,280 --> 03:33:56,760
Oh, wait.

7043
03:33:56,940 --> 03:33:57,080
Okay.

7044
03:33:57,080 --> 03:33:57,660
He's just dead.

7045
03:33:58,100 --> 03:33:58,480
I...

7046
03:33:58,480 --> 03:33:59,820
Honestly, I thought he would...

7047
03:33:59,820 --> 03:34:00,380
Oh, no!

7048
03:34:00,920 --> 03:34:01,340
It's fine.

7049
03:34:01,480 --> 03:34:02,720
I have...

7050
03:34:03,800 --> 03:34:04,200
Nice.

7051
03:34:04,380 --> 03:34:05,240
Oh, you pooped him up!

7052
03:34:06,100 --> 03:34:06,500
Woohoo!

7053
03:34:07,560 --> 03:34:07,940
Yeah.

7054
03:34:07,940 --> 03:34:09,060
I can't.

7055
03:34:10,320 --> 03:34:11,140
Was there Ryan?

7056
03:34:11,300 --> 03:34:11,800
That's a good...

7057
03:34:11,800 --> 03:34:12,900
I don't know what the Ryan was doing.

7058
03:34:13,120 --> 03:34:14,700
The Ryan was trying to have fun.

7059
03:34:18,260 --> 03:34:20,300
Yeah, I need more ability power.

7060
03:34:20,480 --> 03:34:21,640
He was 1v1-ing me.

7061
03:34:21,900 --> 03:34:23,780
Yeah, I saw he was running...

7062
03:34:23,780 --> 03:34:26,120
He was chasing you everywhere.

7063
03:34:26,120 --> 03:34:27,860
I was like, what the fuck is he doing?

7064
03:34:28,620 --> 03:34:30,120
Hey, he's like, get away!

7065
03:34:31,700 --> 03:34:33,140
Leave us alone!

7066
03:34:34,200 --> 03:34:35,520
He loves my meat.

7067
03:34:36,040 --> 03:34:37,740
Yeah, he wants your meat!

7068
03:34:39,300 --> 03:34:40,340
Alright, 15...

7069
03:34:40,340 --> 03:34:41,340
Oh, 20%.

7070
03:34:42,380 --> 03:34:43,600
Alright, I'm gonna take that.

7071
03:34:43,880 --> 03:34:44,420
More weapon...

7072
03:34:44,420 --> 03:34:45,300
Look at my weapon power.

7073
03:34:48,720 --> 03:34:49,560
How do I...

7074
03:34:49,560 --> 03:34:49,780
Oh.

7075
03:34:50,220 --> 03:34:51,100
And press tab.

7076
03:34:51,560 --> 03:34:52,420
And then...

7077
03:34:52,420 --> 03:34:53,480
You can see it.

7078
03:34:53,860 --> 03:34:54,460
And left click.

7079
03:34:54,640 --> 03:34:55,040
Oh, yeah, I see.

7080
03:34:55,040 --> 03:34:55,340
Yeah.

7081
03:34:57,840 --> 03:34:59,360
Eighty-five percent.

7082
03:35:02,080 --> 03:35:04,340
Yeah, I'm super fucking tanky right now.

7083
03:35:04,700 --> 03:35:04,820
I know I get...

7084
03:35:04,820 --> 03:35:05,580
I'm not tanky.

7085
03:35:05,660 --> 03:35:06,600
I'm super fucking strong.

7086
03:35:10,440 --> 03:35:12,100
Y'all just won your meatball.

7087
03:35:12,560 --> 03:35:13,080
Oh, shoot.

7088
03:35:13,260 --> 03:35:14,100
I gotta pick my thing.

7089
03:35:14,660 --> 03:35:15,100
Oh, no.

7090
03:35:15,440 --> 03:35:16,320
You have 14 seconds.

7091
03:35:18,640 --> 03:35:19,200
Okay.

7092
03:35:20,660 --> 03:35:21,500
Hey, guys.

7093
03:35:21,700 --> 03:35:22,260
Just buy that.

7094
03:35:22,480 --> 03:35:24,360
Stadium mode is really fun, guys.

7095
03:35:24,600 --> 03:35:26,040
Compared to normal Overwatch chat.

7096
03:35:26,700 --> 03:35:28,240
It's just more so, like...

7097
03:35:28,240 --> 03:35:29,440
The games are a lot faster.

7098
03:35:30,400 --> 03:35:30,840
And...

7099
03:35:30,840 --> 03:35:32,320
You're not held hostage.

7100
03:35:33,160 --> 03:35:33,460
Huh.

7101
03:35:37,560 --> 03:35:38,800
That's my favorite part.

7102
03:35:39,500 --> 03:35:41,860
And you can change your builds pretty quickly, right?

7103
03:35:42,080 --> 03:35:42,140
Yeah.

7104
03:35:42,220 --> 03:35:44,280
Like, if you sell stuff, you can just change it out for something else?

7105
03:35:44,500 --> 03:35:47,500
Yeah, if you think, like, something's not working, you can just change your build.

7106
03:35:47,760 --> 03:35:48,820
In between rounds.

7107
03:35:49,160 --> 03:35:50,040
Which is something I like.

7108
03:35:51,360 --> 03:35:51,740
Thank you.

7109
03:35:52,360 --> 03:35:54,360
Oh, he's using lava now.

7110
03:35:57,100 --> 03:35:57,740
There you go.

7111
03:35:58,220 --> 03:35:58,820
Roll, meatball.

7112
03:35:59,000 --> 03:35:59,180
Roll.

7113
03:36:00,640 --> 03:36:00,980
Roll.

7114
03:36:01,240 --> 03:36:01,940
Roll, my meatball.

7115
03:36:07,200 --> 03:36:08,200
Oh, my God.

7116
03:36:08,480 --> 03:36:08,840
I'm dead.

7117
03:36:09,600 --> 03:36:09,820
Oh, no.

7118
03:36:10,760 --> 03:36:11,120
That's what...

7119
03:36:11,120 --> 03:36:11,400
A lot of damage.

7120
03:36:11,840 --> 03:36:12,660
Yeah, that was alive.

7121
03:36:12,660 --> 03:36:13,060
Oh, we got it, though.

7122
03:36:13,160 --> 03:36:13,640
We're getting it, right?

7123
03:36:14,920 --> 03:36:15,500
Oh, no.

7124
03:36:15,860 --> 03:36:15,980
No.

7125
03:36:16,740 --> 03:36:17,220
Oh, my God.

7126
03:36:17,340 --> 03:36:17,800
I'm still alive.

7127
03:36:18,680 --> 03:36:19,160
Somehow.

7128
03:36:19,900 --> 03:36:20,380
Somehow.

7129
03:36:20,660 --> 03:36:20,680
Somehow.

7130
03:36:20,680 --> 03:36:21,320
I'm alive.

7131
03:36:21,480 --> 03:36:21,940
I don't know how.

7132
03:36:23,560 --> 03:36:24,520
Where's that mercy?

7133
03:36:25,560 --> 03:36:27,080
I'm just gonna push for it.

7134
03:36:27,260 --> 03:36:27,820
Oh, what?

7135
03:36:27,960 --> 03:36:28,740
Oh, we lost the...

7136
03:36:28,740 --> 03:36:29,340
That's fine.

7137
03:36:29,480 --> 03:36:29,640
It's fine.

7138
03:36:29,720 --> 03:36:30,220
Don't look at him.

7139
03:36:30,440 --> 03:36:30,460
Yeah.

7140
03:36:30,800 --> 03:36:31,460
Don't look at him.

7141
03:36:33,300 --> 03:36:34,000
It's fine.

7142
03:36:36,640 --> 03:36:37,120
Ouch!

7143
03:36:37,560 --> 03:36:38,240
It's okay.

7144
03:36:38,700 --> 03:36:39,700
We're still healthy.

7145
03:36:40,800 --> 03:36:41,820
We're still healthy.

7146
03:36:42,100 --> 03:36:42,620
Oh, my God.

7147
03:36:42,620 --> 03:36:43,080
I almost died.

7148
03:36:43,120 --> 03:36:43,480
Oh, my God.

7149
03:36:43,600 --> 03:36:43,900
It's okay.

7150
03:36:44,120 --> 03:36:44,380
It's okay.

7151
03:36:44,540 --> 03:36:45,940
I don't know where the fuck the Ryan is.

7152
03:36:46,060 --> 03:36:46,720
That's like the...

7153
03:36:46,720 --> 03:36:47,140
Oh, there he is.

7154
03:36:47,540 --> 03:36:47,920
He's showing...

7155
03:36:47,920 --> 03:36:48,680
Oh, my God.

7156
03:36:48,840 --> 03:36:49,160
What?

7157
03:36:49,620 --> 03:36:51,040
Oh, my God.

7158
03:36:51,100 --> 03:36:52,680
He did so much damage to me.

7159
03:36:53,200 --> 03:36:54,320
That's actually crazy.

7160
03:36:54,540 --> 03:36:54,840
Oh, you're gonna rez.

7161
03:36:55,280 --> 03:36:55,640
Yeah.

7162
03:36:56,120 --> 03:36:57,540
But the damage was insane.

7163
03:37:00,420 --> 03:37:01,420
Wait, where did he go?

7164
03:37:02,480 --> 03:37:03,640
Where did the Ryan go?

7165
03:37:04,100 --> 03:37:04,800
Oh, no!

7166
03:37:05,940 --> 03:37:06,780
I did not.

7167
03:37:07,000 --> 03:37:07,840
Oh, I died.

7168
03:37:08,020 --> 03:37:09,240
I was about to wall off his...

7169
03:37:09,860 --> 03:37:10,900
Oh, my God.

7170
03:37:10,900 --> 03:37:11,000
What?

7171
03:37:11,400 --> 03:37:13,320
I did not realize he was...

7172
03:37:14,820 --> 03:37:16,160
He was close to shatter.

7173
03:37:16,620 --> 03:37:18,560
I did not save my barrier for that.

7174
03:37:19,400 --> 03:37:20,540
Have you ever been...

7175
03:37:21,260 --> 03:37:23,160
Have you ever been sponsored to play Overwatch?

7176
03:37:23,500 --> 03:37:23,860
Oh, yeah.

7177
03:37:24,000 --> 03:37:24,260
I have.

7178
03:37:24,540 --> 03:37:26,160
That's how I found out about the stadium.

7179
03:37:27,320 --> 03:37:27,740
Oh, nice.

7180
03:37:28,200 --> 03:37:28,400
Yeah.

7181
03:37:29,500 --> 03:37:29,820
Ah.

7182
03:37:30,700 --> 03:37:31,660
Yeah, that's why I was like...

7183
03:37:31,660 --> 03:37:31,800
Oh!

7184
03:37:32,220 --> 03:37:33,080
Stadium mode.

7185
03:37:33,400 --> 03:37:34,140
Oh, no.

7186
03:37:34,940 --> 03:37:35,400
Not...

7187
03:37:35,400 --> 03:37:35,940
Okay.

7188
03:37:36,020 --> 03:37:37,280
I might be dead here.

7189
03:37:37,520 --> 03:37:40,240
Because there's this little mini Bob that's trying...

7190
03:37:40,240 --> 03:37:40,680
Yes!

7191
03:37:40,940 --> 03:37:41,080
Ah!

7192
03:37:41,180 --> 03:37:42,160
It's the mini Bob.

7193
03:37:42,900 --> 03:37:44,080
I didn't know where to go.

7194
03:37:45,640 --> 03:37:46,040
Oops.

7195
03:37:46,140 --> 03:37:47,360
I booped her out of the thing.

7196
03:37:47,580 --> 03:37:48,060
Oh, no.

7197
03:37:48,120 --> 03:37:48,840
I was dead already.

7198
03:37:49,020 --> 03:37:49,320
That's fine.

7199
03:37:50,020 --> 03:37:51,200
I was already dead.

7200
03:37:51,760 --> 03:37:52,160
Oh.

7201
03:37:52,360 --> 03:37:52,680
That's okay.

7202
03:37:53,280 --> 03:37:53,820
Oh, no.

7203
03:37:53,840 --> 03:37:54,520
Everybody die!

7204
03:37:55,000 --> 03:37:55,280
No!

7205
03:37:56,140 --> 03:37:57,460
Oh, this is a close game.

7206
03:37:59,660 --> 03:38:00,440
Are the...

7207
03:38:00,440 --> 03:38:01,600
Are the abilities...

7208
03:38:01,600 --> 03:38:03,080
Is it a full refund if you sell?

7209
03:38:03,160 --> 03:38:03,740
I think so, right?

7210
03:38:03,960 --> 03:38:04,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7211
03:38:04,680 --> 03:38:05,000
For sure.

7212
03:38:05,000 --> 03:38:05,980
It is.

7213
03:38:09,040 --> 03:38:09,520
Okay.

7214
03:38:09,760 --> 03:38:10,660
I'm on the point.

7215
03:38:12,840 --> 03:38:13,900
Okay, I got the...

7216
03:38:13,900 --> 03:38:14,660
I got the Kiriko.

7217
03:38:15,000 --> 03:38:15,860
I got two!

7218
03:38:17,020 --> 03:38:17,900
I got three!

7219
03:38:19,200 --> 03:38:19,940
Oh, nice!

7220
03:38:20,400 --> 03:38:20,860
Oh!

7221
03:38:21,040 --> 03:38:21,160
Oh, huge!

7222
03:38:22,400 --> 03:38:23,060
Wait, what?

7223
03:38:23,240 --> 03:38:23,940
What the fuck?

7224
03:38:26,180 --> 03:38:28,500
Why the fuck did you give the...

7225
03:38:28,500 --> 03:38:28,880
Okay.

7226
03:38:29,080 --> 03:38:29,920
I have ult for this.

7227
03:38:30,520 --> 03:38:30,980
I have ult.

7228
03:38:32,460 --> 03:38:33,700
I'm gonna push up a little.

7229
03:38:34,080 --> 03:38:36,540
I don't know how the fuck I killed two people there.

7230
03:38:36,760 --> 03:38:38,220
I don't know what the fuck they were doing.

7231
03:38:40,280 --> 03:38:40,720
Nice.

7232
03:38:40,900 --> 03:38:41,580
He gave me energy.

7233
03:38:42,160 --> 03:38:43,320
That's what I like to see.

7234
03:38:47,480 --> 03:38:48,420
Oh my god, nice!

7235
03:38:49,060 --> 03:38:49,500
Stop

7236
03:38:52,890 --> 03:38:53,190
it!

7237
03:39:04,450 --> 03:39:05,510
I like the...

7238
03:39:05,510 --> 03:39:06,570
The grab...

7239
03:39:06,570 --> 03:39:09,110
And then you just rolled in around them.

7240
03:39:11,770 --> 03:39:15,330
Yeah, there's like an upgrade you can get where the meatball explodes.

7241
03:39:15,790 --> 03:39:15,950
Oh!

7242
03:39:16,770 --> 03:39:17,730
That's what you did!

7243
03:39:18,790 --> 03:39:20,510
The ball of doom.

7244
03:39:21,170 --> 03:39:21,510
Yeah.

7245
03:39:21,670 --> 03:39:22,410
What the fuck did this...

7246
03:39:22,410 --> 03:39:23,710
Oh wait, I forgot they did...

7247
03:39:23,710 --> 03:39:24,530
Had one punch man.

7248
03:39:25,310 --> 03:39:25,790
Crossover.

7249
03:39:26,090 --> 03:39:27,270
What the fuck did he do?

7250
03:39:28,030 --> 03:39:28,510
Yeah.

7251
03:39:28,830 --> 03:39:30,310
I was like, that's bad skin.

7252
03:39:30,990 --> 03:39:33,330
Oh my god, yeah, he killed Kiriko twice.

7253
03:39:34,970 --> 03:39:36,290
Oh, okay, that was good.

7254
03:39:38,050 --> 03:39:39,090
That was a good shot.

7255
03:39:40,270 --> 03:39:41,930
You probably had a better play than that.

7256
03:39:42,050 --> 03:39:43,590
When you had three kills...

7257
03:39:43,590 --> 03:39:43,770
That's true.

7258
03:39:44,030 --> 03:39:45,110
When you clutched it, I mean...

7259
03:39:45,110 --> 03:39:46,430
Yeah, that's true.

7260
03:39:47,130 --> 03:39:49,250
I guess because we won, they don't want to give you another win.

7261
03:39:49,610 --> 03:39:49,890
Mm-hmm.

7262
03:39:49,930 --> 03:39:51,330
We were just too good, you know?

7263
03:39:51,610 --> 03:39:53,090
They're like, we gotta give them something.

7264
03:39:55,790 --> 03:39:56,150
Yeah.

7265
03:39:56,550 --> 03:39:58,110
Ours was an actual combo.

7266
03:39:58,290 --> 03:39:58,770
We had like...

7267
03:39:59,350 --> 03:40:01,350
We had like teamwork and everything.

7268
03:40:02,250 --> 03:40:03,690
We were like working together.

7269
03:40:03,690 --> 03:40:03,810
There?

7270
03:40:04,910 --> 03:40:07,330
Okay, now you can experiment with those.

7271
03:40:07,350 --> 03:40:08,010
Maybe that's why they resist.

7272
03:40:09,090 --> 03:40:09,210
Yeah.

7273
03:40:10,250 --> 03:40:11,530
Okay, now you can.

7274
03:40:11,830 --> 03:40:12,090
What?

7275
03:40:14,590 --> 03:40:15,350
Let's see.

7276
03:40:15,570 --> 03:40:16,550
I like mage, pretty fun.

7277
03:40:17,470 --> 03:40:19,050
Oh yeah, I like the...

7278
03:40:19,050 --> 03:40:20,670
Oh, Reaper has a really funny one.

7279
03:40:20,930 --> 03:40:21,690
Where he...

7280
03:40:21,690 --> 03:40:23,030
Every time he TP's...

7281
03:40:23,030 --> 03:40:23,090
Oh.

7282
03:40:23,670 --> 03:40:25,150
We get games so fast.

7283
03:40:26,630 --> 03:40:28,670
But Reaper has a thing where everything he...

7284
03:40:28,670 --> 03:40:31,150
Every time he TP's, he does like a death blossom.

7285
03:40:32,550 --> 03:40:33,970
Like a mini death blossom.

7286
03:40:34,370 --> 03:40:34,770
Oh, okay.

7287
03:40:35,530 --> 03:40:36,150
Yeah, it's...

7288
03:40:36,150 --> 03:40:37,290
Pretty funny.

7289
03:40:37,610 --> 03:40:37,710
That...

7290
03:40:37,710 --> 03:40:38,290
Sounds...

7291
03:40:38,290 --> 03:40:39,490
Annoying to go again.

7292
03:40:39,590 --> 03:40:40,130
Yeah, yeah!

7293
03:40:40,650 --> 03:40:41,550
Oh, we're both DPS.

7294
03:40:41,950 --> 03:40:42,510
Oh.

7295
03:40:42,870 --> 03:40:43,530
You don't play Reaper?

7296
03:40:45,190 --> 03:40:45,750
Uh...

7297
03:40:45,750 --> 03:40:47,710
I feel like we need range though.

7298
03:40:48,190 --> 03:40:49,450
I can try Reaper.

7299
03:40:50,550 --> 03:40:50,950
True.

7300
03:40:51,530 --> 03:40:51,850
Okay.

7301
03:40:53,090 --> 03:40:53,870
I'll try it.

7302
03:40:53,990 --> 03:40:54,790
It's probably fine.

7303
03:40:55,450 --> 03:40:56,810
Yeah, it'll be fine.

7304
03:40:59,570 --> 03:41:00,090
Maybe.

7305
03:41:00,890 --> 03:41:01,310
Maybe.

7306
03:41:01,310 --> 03:41:01,750
We'll be okay.

7307
03:41:02,770 --> 03:41:05,730
Is that like the ability you can get early on with the...

7308
03:41:05,730 --> 03:41:06,770
Yeah, it's one of the powers.

7309
03:41:06,770 --> 03:41:07,750
Or later game.

7310
03:41:08,250 --> 03:41:09,130
It's powers.

7311
03:41:09,370 --> 03:41:10,050
So like...

7312
03:41:10,050 --> 03:41:10,590
Um...

7313
03:41:10,590 --> 03:41:11,550
It's always there.

7314
03:41:12,830 --> 03:41:13,530
Oh yeah.

7315
03:41:13,890 --> 03:41:15,730
I love Soldier 24 skin.

7316
03:41:15,850 --> 03:41:17,210
Cause I can actually see his face.

7317
03:41:20,330 --> 03:41:21,010
these.

7318
03:41:22,210 --> 03:41:23,070
All right.

7319
03:41:23,530 --> 03:41:24,070
Oh my god.

7320
03:41:24,170 --> 03:41:24,810
They're full range.

7321
03:41:24,990 --> 03:41:25,090
Okay.

7322
03:41:26,410 --> 03:41:27,970
I might just have to bully their right.

7323
03:41:31,270 --> 03:41:31,770
Okay.

7324
03:41:32,370 --> 03:41:34,370
They're watching the stream, they countered us!

7325
03:41:34,810 --> 03:41:35,410
They countered us!

7326
03:41:35,410 --> 03:41:36,130
Oh dear, they...

7327
03:41:37,070 --> 03:41:38,210
I have more lifestyle.

7328
03:41:38,790 --> 03:41:40,490
And then...

7329
03:41:41,190 --> 03:41:43,210
Maybe more weapon power...

7330
03:41:43,810 --> 03:41:44,890
Or attack speed.

7331
03:41:46,410 --> 03:41:48,350
No fun for Rhyne, exactly.

7332
03:41:50,930 --> 03:41:52,510
You're just the nearest ally.

7333
03:42:00,580 --> 03:42:01,900
Guys, what should I do?

7334
03:42:02,220 --> 03:42:02,520
Chat.

7335
03:42:09,200 --> 03:42:10,280
Renewal is safe?

7336
03:42:10,440 --> 03:42:10,660
Okay.

7337
03:42:12,060 --> 03:42:13,140
Where the fuck is Renewal?

7338
03:42:13,260 --> 03:42:13,320
Oh.

7339
03:42:14,060 --> 03:42:15,000
10% of your life.

7340
03:42:15,180 --> 03:42:16,180
Oh, okay.

7341
03:42:16,180 --> 03:42:18,500
When I Rafe, I get my HP back.

7342
03:42:20,620 --> 03:42:21,580
Alright, I'm ready.

7343
03:42:25,720 --> 03:42:27,020
I'm almost ready.

7344
03:42:27,700 --> 03:42:28,940
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

7345
03:42:34,660 --> 03:42:35,400
I believe.

7346
03:42:36,340 --> 03:42:37,160
I believe.

7347
03:42:37,680 --> 03:42:38,740
We got this.

7348
03:42:41,000 --> 03:42:41,640
That's great.

7349
03:42:42,340 --> 03:42:44,560
I'd assume more people would play DPS.

7350
03:42:44,940 --> 03:42:45,500
We got...

7351
03:42:46,680 --> 03:42:49,040
You've always been DPS in all the rounds.

7352
03:42:51,480 --> 03:42:53,180
Oh, somebody says in chat...

7353
03:42:53,180 --> 03:42:54,440
Oh, wait, I see.

7354
03:42:54,900 --> 03:42:55,260
Hold on.

7355
03:42:56,240 --> 03:42:58,360
Is there a D.Va in the tanks?

7356
03:42:58,820 --> 03:43:00,020
I don't know, actually.

7357
03:43:01,480 --> 03:43:01,900
Oh.

7358
03:43:02,440 --> 03:43:03,340
Oh my god.

7359
03:43:03,640 --> 03:43:04,220
Okay, goodbye.

7360
03:43:09,140 --> 03:43:09,720
Oh my god.

7361
03:43:09,740 --> 03:43:10,000
Oh my god.

7362
03:43:10,000 --> 03:43:10,660
Ryan is so low though.

7363
03:43:12,900 --> 03:43:13,500
We got him.

7364
03:43:13,940 --> 03:43:14,360
Okay, nice.

7365
03:43:14,540 --> 03:43:14,900
We got him.

7366
03:43:17,520 --> 03:43:18,120
Oh my god.

7367
03:43:18,240 --> 03:43:19,220
You're all so far away.

7368
03:43:19,460 --> 03:43:20,940
How am I supposed to...

7369
03:43:20,940 --> 03:43:22,460
I just have a shotgun.

7370
03:43:24,880 --> 03:43:26,320
What am I supposed to do?

7371
03:43:27,600 --> 03:43:29,340
You're all too far away.

7372
03:43:35,950 --> 03:43:36,470
You're all too far away.

7373
03:43:37,210 --> 03:43:37,710
Goodbye.

7374
03:43:42,130 --> 03:43:42,650
What?

7375
03:43:44,850 --> 03:43:45,570
You know what?

7376
03:43:45,590 --> 03:43:46,770
I'll fucking go after a ride.

7377
03:43:48,170 --> 03:43:48,690
Oh.

7378
03:43:48,950 --> 03:43:49,250
Whoa!

7379
03:43:49,590 --> 03:43:50,130
Never mind.

7380
03:43:52,890 --> 03:43:53,890
You can stay there.

7381
03:43:54,030 --> 03:43:54,530
Oh, wait, wait.

7382
03:43:56,030 --> 03:43:56,550
Weeeee.

7383
03:43:59,350 --> 03:44:00,590
I'll just die, die, die.

7384
03:44:00,890 --> 03:44:01,170
Oh.

7385
03:44:02,050 --> 03:44:02,470
Wait.

7386
03:44:03,110 --> 03:44:03,150
Oh.

7387
03:44:03,550 --> 03:44:04,390
Kind of for them.

7388
03:44:05,550 --> 03:44:06,890
Yeah, I don't think you're having fun.

7389
03:44:07,790 --> 03:44:08,490
Wait, what the fuck?

7390
03:44:08,510 --> 03:44:09,230
What are you doing here?

7391
03:44:09,910 --> 03:44:11,170
Wait, both supports were up here.

7392
03:44:13,430 --> 03:44:13,850
Oh.

7393
03:44:14,250 --> 03:44:14,510
Oh.

7394
03:44:14,790 --> 03:44:16,090
Maybe they're throwing.

7395
03:44:17,630 --> 03:44:18,050
Goodbye.

7396
03:44:18,610 --> 03:44:19,750
My Oshidoki bird is on the other team.

7397
03:44:19,870 --> 03:44:20,710
I must help her.

7398
03:44:20,770 --> 03:44:21,050
We gotta throw.

7399
03:44:21,250 --> 03:44:22,790
We gotta raise her win rate.

7400
03:44:24,130 --> 03:44:24,530
Oh.

7401
03:44:24,930 --> 03:44:25,330
Okay.

7402
03:44:25,770 --> 03:44:26,170
No!

7403
03:44:27,030 --> 03:44:28,370
You're la- Don't worry, I believe!

7404
03:44:28,950 --> 03:44:29,450
There's us.

7405
03:44:29,710 --> 03:44:30,510
You're gonna get rezzed!

7406
03:44:30,550 --> 03:44:31,110
You're gonna get rezzed!

7407
03:44:31,690 --> 03:44:32,450
Oh, fuck!

7408
03:44:33,450 --> 03:44:33,970
It's okay.

7409
03:44:34,070 --> 03:44:35,070
It's not gonna hit- I got hit.

7410
03:44:35,270 --> 03:44:37,350
Oh, he shattered us.

7411
03:44:39,050 --> 03:44:40,030
Are you still alive?

7412
03:44:40,490 --> 03:44:42,250
I have so many ultimates.

7413
03:44:43,430 --> 03:44:44,690
They used everything.

7414
03:44:45,030 --> 03:44:45,190
No, I just rezzed.

7415
03:44:45,530 --> 03:44:46,890
I mean, I just respawned.

7416
03:44:47,490 --> 03:44:47,750
It's okay.

7417
03:44:47,750 --> 03:44:48,370
We have your ult.

7418
03:44:48,690 --> 03:44:48,850
Yeah.

7419
03:44:49,990 --> 03:44:50,510
I'll wait.

7420
03:44:51,950 --> 03:44:52,910
It's not fair.

7421
03:44:53,310 --> 03:44:53,610
Yeah.

7422
03:44:53,610 --> 03:44:56,070
They all- They all just like walk away from me.

7423
03:44:56,210 --> 03:44:56,850
It's not fair.

7424
03:44:57,550 --> 03:45:00,410
What do I do when they just walk backwards?

7425
03:45:01,850 --> 03:45:03,530
How am I- What am I supposed to do that?

7426
03:45:03,950 --> 03:45:04,070
Oh, yeah.

7427
03:45:04,910 --> 03:45:06,170
All I have is my shotgun.

7428
03:45:06,190 --> 03:45:06,990
Oh, now we can get closer.

7429
03:45:12,170 --> 03:45:12,670
It's okay.

7430
03:45:12,870 --> 03:45:13,870
I got your revenge.

7431
03:45:15,390 --> 03:45:16,670
Wait, they just walked away from you.

7432
03:45:18,310 --> 03:45:18,890
That's awkward.

7433
03:45:20,510 --> 03:45:21,130
Where did he go?

7434
03:45:21,570 --> 03:45:22,610
What's this beam?

7435
03:45:23,390 --> 03:45:24,570
Oh, it's the Juno ult.

7436
03:45:28,080 --> 03:45:28,520
Oh.

7437
03:45:29,480 --> 03:45:30,100
It's okay.

7438
03:45:31,660 --> 03:45:32,100
No!

7439
03:45:32,420 --> 03:45:33,540
I didn't see the Juno!

7440
03:45:34,080 --> 03:45:35,520
Juno is behind me!

7441
03:45:35,780 --> 03:45:36,040
Ah!

7442
03:45:36,480 --> 03:45:36,900
What?

7443
03:45:37,720 --> 03:45:38,160
No!

7444
03:45:39,000 --> 03:45:41,480
Wait, I feel like we got so many kills, but we still lost it.

7445
03:45:41,700 --> 03:45:41,720
I know!

7446
03:45:42,220 --> 03:45:46,220
I didn't see the Juno beside- behind me, because I was trying to kill their cast.

7447
03:45:47,920 --> 03:45:49,540
Oh, it had ult too!

7448
03:45:50,120 --> 03:45:51,300
I should've just ulted.

7449
03:45:51,420 --> 03:45:51,940
Steam!

7450
03:45:52,820 --> 03:45:55,960
Okay, I can ult on point and then die with my ult.

7451
03:45:59,460 --> 03:46:01,100
Oh no, I don't think I can touch point.

7452
03:46:03,140 --> 03:46:05,260
Oh, I just got on point!

7453
03:46:05,260 --> 03:46:05,400
What?

7454
03:46:06,020 --> 03:46:06,260
No!

7455
03:46:08,300 --> 03:46:09,400
I tried!

7456
03:46:09,880 --> 03:46:11,320
I should've gone faster too.

7457
03:46:11,660 --> 03:46:13,820
Yeah, I just got there.

7458
03:46:14,120 --> 03:46:14,220
Oh damn!

7459
03:46:15,820 --> 03:46:16,240
Sad.

7460
03:46:17,120 --> 03:46:20,120
I feel like you consistently get the MVP card.

7461
03:46:20,480 --> 03:46:21,980
Yeah, I'm farming damage.

7462
03:46:22,480 --> 03:46:23,320
Sounds like you're a pro or something!

7463
03:46:25,220 --> 03:46:27,140
I'm just farming damage.

7464
03:46:29,640 --> 03:46:31,820
Alright, I need more weapon power, I'm pretty sure.

7465
03:46:32,820 --> 03:46:33,580
Can I have fort?

7466
03:46:33,700 --> 03:46:34,200
Oh, I can.

7467
03:46:34,560 --> 03:46:36,360
I'll just take away...

7468
03:46:36,360 --> 03:46:38,000
I'll get the cooldown too.

7469
03:46:40,120 --> 03:46:40,400
Okay.

7470
03:46:43,240 --> 03:46:48,760
It's just not- it just has two ranged characters, so all I can do is just slowly go up to them.

7471
03:46:48,760 --> 03:46:52,200
As I shotgun- do firing shotgun.

7472
03:46:52,720 --> 03:46:53,080
Yeah.

7473
03:46:54,240 --> 03:46:58,040
I think it kind of works if I'm walling them off and then you're able to get closer.

7474
03:46:58,200 --> 03:46:58,660
Oh, that's true.

7475
03:46:58,820 --> 03:47:00,660
Otherwise they're able to just kick us off.

7476
03:47:00,940 --> 03:47:02,160
We can try doing that to the Rhine.

7477
03:47:02,280 --> 03:47:05,200
We can both just walk up- walk up to the Rhine and try that.

7478
03:47:06,260 --> 03:47:08,320
Let's just make sure the Rhine doesn't have a good time.

7479
03:47:08,500 --> 03:47:09,320
Okay, I'll try to wall them off.

7480
03:47:09,360 --> 03:47:09,380
Yeah.

7481
03:47:09,700 --> 03:47:11,780
I've been flanking so I'll just do front line instead.

7482
03:47:11,780 --> 03:47:12,800
Wait, what do you mean?

7483
03:47:14,560 --> 03:47:14,920
Okay.

7484
03:47:15,240 --> 03:47:16,780
Like, can you remember when I was- Do you wall off the Rhine?

7485
03:47:16,920 --> 03:47:17,840
Do I like- Yeah.

7486
03:47:18,760 --> 03:47:19,960
Remember when I was Zarya?

7487
03:47:20,200 --> 03:47:21,380
Like, section him off from his team?

7488
03:47:21,660 --> 03:47:22,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

7489
03:47:22,540 --> 03:47:26,440
So when I was Zarya, you kept walling him away from his team and then I just killed him.

7490
03:47:26,780 --> 03:47:28,900
I can do that, but as we're free too.

7491
03:47:30,540 --> 03:47:31,580
Alright, let's go.

7492
03:47:32,740 --> 03:47:34,060
We'll just do front line either.

7493
03:47:34,840 --> 03:47:36,000
I'll stop nanking.

7494
03:47:36,740 --> 03:47:37,000
Okay.

7495
03:47:38,160 --> 03:47:39,980
That's why we're strategizing now.

7496
03:47:44,030 --> 03:47:44,770
Oh, nice!

7497
03:47:45,170 --> 03:47:45,590
Okay.

7498
03:47:49,670 --> 03:47:50,510
Oh my god.

7499
03:47:50,650 --> 03:47:50,730
Oh my god.

7500
03:47:50,730 --> 03:47:52,150
This Rhine is actually just walking.

7501
03:47:52,350 --> 03:47:53,070
He's so scared.

7502
03:47:57,960 --> 03:47:59,140
Oh my god.

7503
03:48:00,420 --> 03:48:01,360
Nice, nice block.

7504
03:48:04,320 --> 03:48:05,200
There we go.

7505
03:48:06,020 --> 03:48:06,260
Oh!

7506
03:48:06,880 --> 03:48:07,280
It worked!

7507
03:48:07,780 --> 03:48:08,700
It's working!

7508
03:48:11,520 --> 03:48:12,720
Okay, I'm backing away.

7509
03:48:12,900 --> 03:48:13,700
It can have that.

7510
03:48:16,980 --> 03:48:17,420
Hello.

7511
03:48:17,700 --> 03:48:17,780
Okay.

7512
03:48:23,020 --> 03:48:23,400
Nice.

7513
03:48:24,620 --> 03:48:25,480
Oh my god.

7514
03:48:25,620 --> 03:48:26,520
I didn't expect it either.

7515
03:48:28,560 --> 03:48:29,920
That's a good wall.

7516
03:48:29,920 --> 03:48:31,220
He's low.

7517
03:48:31,580 --> 03:48:32,780
He's so low!

7518
03:48:33,280 --> 03:48:34,240
He's so low!

7519
03:48:34,740 --> 03:48:35,100
He's so low!

7520
03:48:35,100 --> 03:48:35,480
Oh, nice!

7521
03:48:35,600 --> 03:48:36,140
Nice meatball!

7522
03:48:37,820 --> 03:48:38,980
Oh my god.

7523
03:48:39,200 --> 03:48:40,160
I'm so scared though.

7524
03:48:44,120 --> 03:48:44,840
No!

7525
03:48:45,820 --> 03:48:47,340
I got charged!

7526
03:48:48,540 --> 03:48:50,300
He charged me!

7527
03:48:50,540 --> 03:48:50,860
No, really!

7528
03:48:51,040 --> 03:48:51,480
No!

7529
03:48:51,860 --> 03:48:53,320
I got charged!

7530
03:48:54,760 --> 03:48:55,680
It's only you.

7531
03:48:55,880 --> 03:48:57,360
It's only you and the Mercy.

7532
03:48:57,360 --> 03:48:59,280
I got pinned!

7533
03:49:00,520 --> 03:49:01,600
My beautiful urge!

7534
03:49:03,920 --> 03:49:05,020
Heals to me!

7535
03:49:05,300 --> 03:49:05,820
They know.

7536
03:49:06,040 --> 03:49:06,540
They know.

7537
03:49:06,760 --> 03:49:06,900
They know.

7538
03:49:06,920 --> 03:49:09,000
You're our power strat.

7539
03:49:09,480 --> 03:49:10,080
Power card.

7540
03:49:11,240 --> 03:49:12,420
Oh my god.

7541
03:49:12,780 --> 03:49:14,320
I'm so fucking...

7542
03:49:14,320 --> 03:49:15,740
Just a little baby.

7543
03:49:16,380 --> 03:49:17,200
Not fair.

7544
03:49:17,520 --> 03:49:18,680
Oh my god.

7545
03:49:19,080 --> 03:49:21,220
I'm literally like a miniature tank right now.

7546
03:49:21,400 --> 03:49:22,260
Oh, I knew it.

7547
03:49:22,340 --> 03:49:23,460
I knew he was gonna do that too.

7548
03:49:23,460 --> 03:49:24,380
Oh my god.

7549
03:49:24,520 --> 03:49:25,860
Oh my god.

7550
03:49:25,860 --> 03:49:26,440
Oh my god.

7551
03:49:33,050 --> 03:49:34,290
Oh my god.

7552
03:49:34,290 --> 03:49:35,290
Oh, he's frozen.

7553
03:49:36,250 --> 03:49:36,670
No!

7554
03:49:37,110 --> 03:49:37,470
It's okay.

7555
03:49:37,570 --> 03:49:38,630
Amura got...

7556
03:49:39,310 --> 03:49:40,110
I didn't think...

7557
03:49:40,110 --> 03:49:40,410
Oh okay.

7558
03:49:40,550 --> 03:49:40,690
Nice.

7559
03:49:40,690 --> 03:49:43,350
The castle was so large.

7560
03:49:43,830 --> 03:49:47,090
I wasn't expecting how large the castle was.

7561
03:49:51,830 --> 03:49:53,250
Where the fuck is the run?

7562
03:49:53,910 --> 03:49:55,770
I'm a little scared, because I'm like, oh, there he is.

7563
03:50:01,310 --> 03:50:02,770
Oh my god, he's so fat.

7564
03:50:03,070 --> 03:50:03,970
Oh my god!

7565
03:50:04,370 --> 03:50:05,750
Okay, I'm feeding now.

7566
03:50:06,230 --> 03:50:07,170
I'm feeding.

7567
03:50:08,590 --> 03:50:10,150
I believe in you, Doobie.

7568
03:50:10,330 --> 03:50:10,930
Carry this.

7569
03:50:11,790 --> 03:50:12,910
I'm just feeding.

7570
03:50:14,270 --> 03:50:15,370
Oh, okay.

7571
03:50:15,770 --> 03:50:16,770
I'm inting.

7572
03:50:18,510 --> 03:50:19,950
Reaper's not the pick.

7573
03:50:21,270 --> 03:50:23,790
He is absolutely not the pick, guys.

7574
03:50:25,710 --> 03:50:28,610
It does seem like you need more ranged characters for this.

7575
03:50:28,610 --> 03:50:28,750
Yeah.

7576
03:50:30,030 --> 03:50:30,630
100%.

7577
03:50:30,630 --> 03:50:31,950
He got shatter, too.

7578
03:50:33,050 --> 03:50:33,690
I knew it.

7579
03:50:35,110 --> 03:50:36,550
I knew he had shatter.

7580
03:50:38,990 --> 03:50:39,590
Reload.

7581
03:50:45,400 --> 03:50:46,380
I got the ride.

7582
03:50:46,880 --> 03:50:48,060
Oh my god, I'm dead blossom.

7583
03:50:48,860 --> 03:50:49,980
I'm gonna stay on point.

7584
03:50:50,400 --> 03:50:51,720
I don't trust our team.

7585
03:50:52,540 --> 03:50:52,660
Okay.

7586
03:50:53,780 --> 03:50:54,220
Yeah.

7587
03:50:55,940 --> 03:50:56,380
Oh.

7588
03:50:57,180 --> 03:50:58,020
That was scary.

7589
03:50:58,280 --> 03:50:59,140
I have ult here.

7590
03:50:59,140 --> 03:50:59,660
Alright, we got it.

7591
03:50:59,820 --> 03:51:01,060
I hope we don't see nine.

7592
03:51:02,600 --> 03:51:02,940
Okay.

7593
03:51:02,940 --> 03:51:04,920
They almost got the lead.

7594
03:51:05,520 --> 03:51:06,600
I have ult.

7595
03:51:06,680 --> 03:51:06,780
No.

7596
03:51:07,240 --> 03:51:07,360
No.

7597
03:51:08,320 --> 03:51:09,600
Why would we do that?

7598
03:51:10,200 --> 03:51:10,460
Yeah.

7599
03:51:10,740 --> 03:51:12,940
That would be so awkward if that happens, guys.

7600
03:51:16,830 --> 03:51:17,370
That's it.

7601
03:51:18,530 --> 03:51:19,350
I don't care.

7602
03:51:19,410 --> 03:51:21,650
As long as the Rhyme dies, that's all that matters.

7603
03:51:23,150 --> 03:51:24,310
It was worth it.

7604
03:51:24,310 --> 03:51:26,030
I got the Rhyme.

7605
03:51:27,590 --> 03:51:29,070
It was so worth it.

7606
03:51:30,110 --> 03:51:30,670
Please.

7607
03:51:32,230 --> 03:51:33,950
It's just Soldier and Mercy.

7608
03:51:34,290 --> 03:51:35,650
And Mora and...

7609
03:51:35,650 --> 03:51:35,790
Okay.

7610
03:51:35,950 --> 03:51:37,450
Maybe it wasn't worth it.

7611
03:51:37,950 --> 03:51:38,690
Oh, it was!

7612
03:51:41,270 --> 03:51:42,130
Nice trade.

7613
03:51:42,250 --> 03:51:42,650
Nice trade.

7614
03:51:44,510 --> 03:51:45,070
Nice.

7615
03:51:45,550 --> 03:51:46,110
Nice, nice.

7616
03:51:48,250 --> 03:51:49,550
It was worth it.

7617
03:51:49,690 --> 03:51:50,290
I knew it.

7618
03:51:50,470 --> 03:51:51,170
It's kind of stressful.

7619
03:51:51,170 --> 03:51:52,350
I knew it.

7620
03:51:52,930 --> 03:51:54,270
Too much stuff happening.

7621
03:51:54,870 --> 03:51:56,650
It's so intense.

7622
03:51:58,350 --> 03:51:59,250
All the abilities.

7623
03:51:59,730 --> 03:52:01,630
Oh my god.

7624
03:52:01,990 --> 03:52:03,190
What do we do?

7625
03:52:04,250 --> 03:52:04,770
Okay.

7626
03:52:05,170 --> 03:52:05,990
Attack power.

7627
03:52:06,750 --> 03:52:07,950
Always weapon power.

7628
03:52:14,920 --> 03:52:16,280
Maybe cooldown?

7629
03:52:18,700 --> 03:52:19,580
Okay.

7630
03:52:20,330 --> 03:52:20,720
Okay.

7631
03:52:22,450 --> 03:52:22,840
Guys.

7632
03:52:23,140 --> 03:52:24,520
What do I do for power?

7633
03:52:35,230 --> 03:52:37,480
Double my lifesteal for three seconds?

7634
03:52:37,820 --> 03:52:39,960
I don't use Shadow Step, though.

7635
03:52:52,080 --> 03:52:52,860
Maybe...

7636
03:52:52,860 --> 03:52:55,880
Grant's attack speed for one second.

7637
03:52:57,340 --> 03:52:57,780
Cooldown?

7638
03:52:58,640 --> 03:52:59,560
I don't have time.

7639
03:52:59,780 --> 03:53:00,580
Guys, I don't have time.

7640
03:53:02,420 --> 03:53:03,300
There's no cooldown!

7641
03:53:04,420 --> 03:53:05,180
It's Mike getting that.

7642
03:53:07,200 --> 03:53:08,520
I don't know what to get.

7643
03:53:09,120 --> 03:53:10,600
I couldn't get the thing I wanted to.

7644
03:53:10,860 --> 03:53:11,080
Okay.

7645
03:53:12,040 --> 03:53:12,460
It's okay.

7646
03:53:13,260 --> 03:53:15,200
We have the next round.

7647
03:53:19,150 --> 03:53:19,590
Yeah.

7648
03:53:20,130 --> 03:53:21,490
Oh, do people still play?

7649
03:53:21,590 --> 03:53:23,370
People still play like normal ranked mode in this game, right?

7650
03:53:23,370 --> 03:53:24,490
Yeah, they still play, yeah.

7651
03:53:24,490 --> 03:53:26,510
Like a regular or what?

7652
03:53:27,230 --> 03:53:29,590
Yeah, but it's dive meta.

7653
03:53:29,910 --> 03:53:30,230
Do you?

7654
03:53:30,310 --> 03:53:30,970
Do you play?

7655
03:53:31,330 --> 03:53:32,290
No, I just play stadium.

7656
03:53:33,270 --> 03:53:34,090
It's just...

7657
03:53:34,090 --> 03:53:36,650
It's cause it's dive meta right now, so like...

7658
03:53:37,630 --> 03:53:38,490
I ain't about that.

7659
03:53:39,330 --> 03:53:39,710
No!

7660
03:53:39,710 --> 03:53:39,810
No!

7661
03:53:42,350 --> 03:53:43,690
Okay, to be fair...

7662
03:53:43,690 --> 03:53:45,190
To be fair, like...

7663
03:53:45,950 --> 03:53:46,870
I like...

7664
03:53:46,870 --> 03:53:48,190
I was just letting it happen.

7665
03:53:48,510 --> 03:53:51,550
I was walking up there and be like, You're not gonna...

7666
03:53:51,550 --> 03:53:54,050
You're not gonna fucking charge me.

7667
03:53:54,590 --> 03:53:55,790
I'm just a guy.

7668
03:53:57,090 --> 03:53:58,270
Oh wait, we got a res.

7669
03:53:58,630 --> 03:53:59,210
I'm just...

7670
03:53:59,210 --> 03:54:00,770
Yeah, just a little reaper.

7671
03:54:00,790 --> 03:54:02,230
I'm just a little reaper.

7672
03:54:02,490 --> 03:54:02,550
Nice.

7673
03:54:03,430 --> 03:54:04,410
Aw, they capped though.

7674
03:54:07,310 --> 03:54:08,390
This reaper...

7675
03:54:08,390 --> 03:54:09,690
This Ryan is so annoying.

7676
03:54:11,350 --> 03:54:11,810
No!

7677
03:54:13,950 --> 03:54:14,510
Again?

7678
03:54:18,070 --> 03:54:22,440
I didn't think he...

7679
03:54:22,440 --> 03:54:26,160
I didn't think he had charge.

7680
03:54:26,160 --> 03:54:26,840
I...

7681
03:54:29,920 --> 03:54:31,820
I raped in front of him.

7682
03:54:32,000 --> 03:54:32,920
Cause I was like, I'll be fine.

7683
03:54:33,360 --> 03:54:34,380
It's like one of those things where...

7684
03:54:36,500 --> 03:54:37,020
Yeah.

7685
03:54:37,340 --> 03:54:37,500
Oh my god.

7686
03:54:37,500 --> 03:54:39,100
The abilities have like the less cooldown.

7687
03:54:39,500 --> 03:54:40,020
Yeah.

7688
03:54:40,640 --> 03:54:43,740
Yeah, I'm pretty sure he has cooldown reduction there.

7689
03:54:45,080 --> 03:54:46,860
No, this is a good Ryan though.

7690
03:54:47,020 --> 03:54:48,440
This Ryan is really good.

7691
03:54:48,620 --> 03:54:49,380
And very annoying.

7692
03:54:50,320 --> 03:54:50,680
Yeah.

7693
03:54:53,160 --> 03:54:54,400
Oh my god.

7694
03:54:54,600 --> 03:54:56,140
And then there's the fucking Juno.

7695
03:54:56,140 --> 03:54:57,640
that I have to worry about too.

7696
03:54:58,280 --> 03:55:00,140
I wish I had range right now.

7697
03:55:01,020 --> 03:55:03,020
I hate this non-range hit.

7698
03:55:03,620 --> 03:55:04,020
What?

7699
03:55:06,680 --> 03:55:09,740
All I can do is just shoot his shield.

7700
03:55:12,020 --> 03:55:14,620
If we go right side, maybe...

7701
03:55:14,620 --> 03:55:15,480
I think I have to flank.

7702
03:55:16,500 --> 03:55:18,600
I have to flank and try and get a pick, I think.

7703
03:55:18,600 --> 03:55:18,920
Yeah.

7704
03:55:19,520 --> 03:55:22,080
Like, I can't just shoot the shield.

7705
03:55:23,700 --> 03:55:24,120
I can't just shoot the shield.

7706
03:55:24,120 --> 03:55:25,380
Oh, we couldn't get it.

7707
03:55:25,760 --> 03:55:25,900
Ah.

7708
03:55:26,960 --> 03:55:27,640
Unlucky.

7709
03:55:28,880 --> 03:55:30,340
That round was so fast.

7710
03:55:30,680 --> 03:55:31,300
I know.

7711
03:55:31,920 --> 03:55:32,120
Ah.

7712
03:55:32,220 --> 03:55:33,440
I wish...

7713
03:55:34,160 --> 03:55:36,700
I wish I could do more.

7714
03:55:38,020 --> 03:55:39,060
Next up...

7715
03:55:39,660 --> 03:55:40,840
I have to flank.

7716
03:55:41,440 --> 03:55:42,560
I can't fight this Ryan.

7717
03:55:43,000 --> 03:55:44,520
He has too much resources.

7718
03:55:45,160 --> 03:55:46,300
The teams are gearing up.

7719
03:55:46,400 --> 03:55:46,940
Okay.

7720
03:55:47,040 --> 03:55:48,800
I can do another weapon power.

7721
03:55:49,500 --> 03:55:50,920
Oh, if we can upgrade something.

7722
03:55:51,200 --> 03:55:51,480
Yeah.

7723
03:55:51,760 --> 03:55:52,700
We can try and...

7724
03:55:53,280 --> 03:55:54,180
fix this.

7725
03:55:55,740 --> 03:55:57,500
We need to fix this.

7726
03:55:59,540 --> 03:56:00,060
Uh...

7727
03:56:00,060 --> 03:56:00,180
Wait.

7728
03:56:00,280 --> 03:56:00,880
Do I have a...

7729
03:56:00,880 --> 03:56:01,260
No.

7730
03:56:02,660 --> 03:56:02,960
Okay.

7731
03:56:03,460 --> 03:56:03,980
I...

7732
03:56:04,260 --> 03:56:04,520
This.

7733
03:56:05,240 --> 03:56:06,220
And then...

7734
03:56:06,220 --> 03:56:08,120
A 55% weapon power now.

7735
03:56:10,280 --> 03:56:11,360
Can we fix it?

7736
03:56:11,740 --> 03:56:12,260
Nice.

7737
03:56:13,100 --> 03:56:13,620
Alright.

7738
03:56:13,780 --> 03:56:14,500
I'm gonna go flank.

7739
03:56:17,420 --> 03:56:17,940
Alright.

7740
03:56:18,420 --> 03:56:19,280
We don't need armor.

7741
03:56:19,400 --> 03:56:20,580
Armor is for pussies, guys.

7742
03:56:23,620 --> 03:56:24,140
Yeah.

7743
03:56:24,280 --> 03:56:24,980
We just need a kill.

7744
03:56:25,260 --> 03:56:25,500
Yeah.

7745
03:56:25,500 --> 03:56:25,640
Yeah.

7746
03:56:25,920 --> 03:56:27,020
It's all about kills.

7747
03:56:30,340 --> 03:56:31,460
I can do this.

7748
03:56:31,940 --> 03:56:32,740
I'll just flank.

7749
03:56:34,400 --> 03:56:34,920
You...

7750
03:56:34,920 --> 03:56:36,180
Your mission is to survive.

7751
03:56:36,360 --> 03:56:37,360
My mission is to flank.

7752
03:56:39,240 --> 03:56:39,800
Amazing.

7753
03:56:41,100 --> 03:56:41,440
Yeah.

7754
03:56:41,700 --> 03:56:42,040
Wait, what?

7755
03:56:43,380 --> 03:56:44,560
I love that voice line.

7756
03:56:44,860 --> 03:56:44,980
Survive.

7757
03:56:45,440 --> 03:56:46,120
Yeah, survive.

7758
03:56:46,380 --> 03:56:46,980
Doobie, survive.

7759
03:56:48,560 --> 03:56:49,120
Amazing.

7760
03:56:49,600 --> 03:56:50,060
Amazing.

7761
03:56:52,580 --> 03:56:52,960
Alright.

7762
03:56:52,960 --> 03:56:52,980
Alright.

7763
03:56:53,160 --> 03:56:54,520
Yeah, I have to like...

7764
03:56:54,520 --> 03:56:55,720
Run away from their Ryan.

7765
03:56:56,240 --> 03:56:58,320
Their Ryan is actually just fucking...

7766
03:56:58,320 --> 03:56:59,320
Hunting me down.

7767
03:57:01,480 --> 03:57:02,100
Uh-huh.

7768
03:57:03,180 --> 03:57:04,760
I'll try to distract him in the front.

7769
03:57:05,140 --> 03:57:05,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

7770
03:57:06,520 --> 03:57:07,600
I'm gonna go on the side.

7771
03:57:11,100 --> 03:57:12,180
Oh, he saw me.

7772
03:57:18,040 --> 03:57:18,520
Oh.

7773
03:57:22,820 --> 03:57:23,740
Oh my god.

7774
03:57:23,860 --> 03:57:24,460
He's one!

7775
03:57:24,760 --> 03:57:25,080
No!

7776
03:57:25,740 --> 03:57:27,160
Their soldier was one!

7777
03:57:27,660 --> 03:57:27,860
Ah!

7778
03:57:28,720 --> 03:57:29,760
But he had like...

7779
03:57:29,760 --> 03:57:30,020
Oh.

7780
03:57:30,380 --> 03:57:31,080
He had to double.

7781
03:57:31,400 --> 03:57:32,720
He double helixed me.

7782
03:57:33,160 --> 03:57:34,000
You guys got this!

7783
03:57:34,580 --> 03:57:35,120
I just...

7784
03:57:35,120 --> 03:57:35,320
Yes!

7785
03:57:37,960 --> 03:57:39,100
I'm coming back.

7786
03:57:39,940 --> 03:57:40,700
Don't worry.

7787
03:57:40,700 --> 03:57:42,020
Now that the Ryan is dead.

7788
03:57:42,240 --> 03:57:42,960
The Rape...

7789
03:57:42,960 --> 03:57:43,100
Oh.

7790
03:57:44,040 --> 03:57:44,060
Oh.

7791
03:57:44,300 --> 03:57:44,620
We are.

7792
03:57:45,420 --> 03:57:46,900
Our Junker is dead.

7793
03:57:47,140 --> 03:57:47,240
No.

7794
03:57:47,700 --> 03:57:48,220
Wait, it's fine.

7795
03:57:50,060 --> 03:57:50,500
Nice.

7796
03:57:50,560 --> 03:57:50,880
Nice wall.

7797
03:57:51,000 --> 03:57:51,700
Wait, what you got, Rose?

7798
03:57:52,920 --> 03:57:53,360
Yeah.

7799
03:57:57,260 --> 03:57:58,540
They have vaults.

7800
03:57:58,580 --> 03:57:58,860
Right?

7801
03:57:59,060 --> 03:57:59,500
No.

7802
03:58:00,240 --> 03:58:01,100
No, no, no.

7803
03:58:01,900 --> 03:58:02,400
He shouldn't.

7804
03:58:02,480 --> 03:58:02,800
Not that.

7805
03:58:03,220 --> 03:58:03,520
No.

7806
03:58:03,820 --> 03:58:04,200
I'm sorry.

7807
03:58:04,320 --> 03:58:06,620
The soldier looked like he was getting ready to maybe try.

7808
03:58:06,960 --> 03:58:07,260
Yeah.

7809
03:58:08,760 --> 03:58:09,240
Okay.

7810
03:58:10,600 --> 03:58:11,320
It's fine.

7811
03:58:11,560 --> 03:58:13,360
I don't want to deal with the...

7812
03:58:13,360 --> 03:58:14,060
With the Rai.

7813
03:58:14,540 --> 03:58:16,040
You guys can deal with him.

7814
03:58:20,210 --> 03:58:20,690
Ah!

7815
03:58:21,190 --> 03:58:22,390
Are you serious?

7816
03:58:30,140 --> 03:58:31,360
Oh my god, the cast is one.

7817
03:58:31,540 --> 03:58:31,740
Nice.

7818
03:58:34,060 --> 03:58:34,540
Whaaat?

7819
03:58:35,100 --> 03:58:36,240
So much damage.

7820
03:58:36,720 --> 03:58:36,820
Oh!

7821
03:58:40,920 --> 03:58:41,400
Oh!

7822
03:58:41,960 --> 03:58:42,980
Please let me...

7823
03:58:42,980 --> 03:58:44,380
Die, die him.

7824
03:58:45,440 --> 03:58:45,800
Nice.

7825
03:58:46,020 --> 03:58:46,380
Nice.

7826
03:58:46,380 --> 03:58:46,960
Nice, I got the soldier.

7827
03:58:47,220 --> 03:58:47,580
No!

7828
03:58:47,820 --> 03:58:47,980
No!

7829
03:58:48,140 --> 03:58:49,060
Oh my god, he almost charged me.

7830
03:58:49,240 --> 03:58:49,660
I got him.

7831
03:58:50,500 --> 03:58:50,860
What?

7832
03:58:51,340 --> 03:58:51,460
No!

7833
03:58:52,080 --> 03:58:53,060
That's why I killed him.

7834
03:58:54,720 --> 03:58:55,780
Are you gonna rest?

7835
03:58:55,980 --> 03:58:56,220
Nice.

7836
03:58:56,400 --> 03:58:56,600
Nice.

7837
03:58:57,660 --> 03:58:58,280
Oh, thank god.

7838
03:58:58,480 --> 03:58:59,160
That scared me.

7839
03:58:59,280 --> 03:58:59,780
Oh, we got this.

7840
03:59:00,120 --> 03:59:00,740
Yeah, we got it.

7841
03:59:01,220 --> 03:59:02,320
I'll stay on the point.

7842
03:59:02,560 --> 03:59:03,220
So we can cap.

7843
03:59:04,940 --> 03:59:05,300
Nice.

7844
03:59:07,280 --> 03:59:08,260
Don't let him get near.

7845
03:59:08,420 --> 03:59:09,260
Don't let the Rai touch.

7846
03:59:10,160 --> 03:59:10,520
Please.

7847
03:59:11,280 --> 03:59:12,400
Anything but the Rai.

7848
03:59:15,620 --> 03:59:16,720
Get out of here, Juno.

7849
03:59:16,760 --> 03:59:17,100
We got him.

7850
03:59:17,700 --> 03:59:18,540
Oh, thank god.

7851
03:59:22,120 --> 03:59:23,380
Oh, wow.

7852
03:59:23,600 --> 03:59:24,940
Our Junker Queen did so much.

7853
03:59:25,040 --> 03:59:26,240
She did 6k damage.

7854
03:59:27,900 --> 03:59:28,320
That's great.

7855
03:59:28,560 --> 03:59:29,120
Wait, what the fuck?

7856
03:59:29,260 --> 03:59:30,280
What was she shooting?

7857
03:59:30,700 --> 03:59:30,840
Oh, nice.

7858
03:59:32,380 --> 03:59:34,620
The Rai is actually solo carrying the team though.

7859
03:59:34,880 --> 03:59:37,300
Like, 46k points.

7860
03:59:38,200 --> 03:59:38,630
That's...

7861
03:59:39,060 --> 03:59:39,400
That's so much.

7862
03:59:39,880 --> 03:59:40,080
Alright.

7863
03:59:40,800 --> 03:59:41,660
More...

7864
03:59:42,010 --> 03:59:43,180
More weapon power.

7865
03:59:46,180 --> 03:59:47,040
Um...

7866
03:59:47,040 --> 03:59:48,460
I could do cooldown reduction.

7867
03:59:48,460 --> 03:59:49,740
So I can Wraith more.

7868
03:59:52,030 --> 03:59:53,320
And then...

7869
03:59:53,320 --> 03:59:54,580
Weapon power.

7870
03:59:58,560 --> 03:59:59,320
Uh...

7871
03:59:59,320 --> 04:00:00,680
Um...

7872
04:00:07,240 --> 04:00:08,420
Ability power.

7873
04:00:10,440 --> 04:00:11,140
Not...

7874
04:00:11,140 --> 04:00:11,680
I'm gonna...

7875
04:00:11,680 --> 04:00:12,840
Mm...

7876
04:00:13,800 --> 04:00:15,200
I feel like...

7877
04:00:15,200 --> 04:00:16,520
The death step...

7878
04:00:16,760 --> 04:00:18,780
The mini Death Blossom might not be that good.

7879
04:00:18,780 --> 04:00:20,000
If I'm...

7880
04:00:20,000 --> 04:00:21,500
Trying to use it to flank.

7881
04:00:35,230 --> 04:00:38,230
I don't care about my team enough to heal my teammates.

7882
04:00:39,670 --> 04:00:42,630
I'm just not close enough to you guys!

7883
04:00:45,670 --> 04:00:48,330
You guys are not close to me to get healed.

7884
04:00:51,370 --> 04:00:54,230
Someone in the chat says, Overwatch has a buy menu now.

7885
04:00:54,410 --> 04:00:55,750
This is the new mode.

7886
04:00:55,930 --> 04:00:56,950
Yeah, it's the future.

7887
04:00:57,310 --> 04:00:57,790
Stadium.

7888
04:00:59,370 --> 04:01:00,930
The future of Overwatch.

7889
04:01:01,250 --> 04:01:01,330
Yeah.

7890
04:01:03,230 --> 04:01:04,110
Next genre.

7891
04:01:04,270 --> 04:01:07,530
I think it's more than ever be like a pro type of...

7892
04:01:07,530 --> 04:01:08,390
Pro stadium?

7893
04:01:08,950 --> 04:01:10,490
...level, like a casting.

7894
04:01:11,450 --> 04:01:14,190
You can all get casted or like a tournament or something.

7895
04:01:14,550 --> 04:01:16,750
I think they put more resources into it.

7896
04:01:16,810 --> 04:01:17,490
It's fun though.

7897
04:01:17,490 --> 04:01:19,910
I think stadium is like more fun in general.

7898
04:01:20,210 --> 04:01:22,030
But it could be like super messy.

7899
04:01:22,310 --> 04:01:23,890
It would be like so fast though.

7900
04:01:24,010 --> 04:01:28,130
Like these games are super fast compared to like the real game.

7901
04:01:31,330 --> 04:01:32,310
Yeah, that's true.

7902
04:01:32,470 --> 04:01:32,730
That's true.

7903
04:01:33,110 --> 04:01:36,610
Yeah, because I feel like the games go by a lot faster in general.

7904
04:01:36,890 --> 04:01:37,910
Oh my god, not the ride.

7905
04:01:38,090 --> 04:01:39,290
Don't let me get near the ride.

7906
04:01:39,590 --> 04:01:39,930
Please.

7907
04:01:43,570 --> 04:01:44,350
Can't flank.

7908
04:01:45,310 --> 04:01:46,550
They won't let me flank.

7909
04:01:49,750 --> 04:01:50,230
Nice.

7910
04:01:54,160 --> 04:01:55,200
I saw the Mora.

7911
04:01:55,340 --> 04:01:55,760
There she is.

7912
04:01:56,180 --> 04:01:57,120
Oh my god.

7913
04:01:57,440 --> 04:01:58,360
Oh my god.

7914
04:01:58,480 --> 04:01:59,480
Oh my god.

7915
04:01:59,480 --> 04:01:59,500
Oh my god.

7916
04:01:59,500 --> 04:02:00,720
I'm still alive somehow.

7917
04:02:00,720 --> 04:02:00,740
Oh my god, let me come out.

7918
04:02:02,880 --> 04:02:03,360
Ah!

7919
04:02:03,760 --> 04:02:03,880
Oh.

7920
04:02:09,700 --> 04:02:10,180
It's OK.

7921
04:02:10,360 --> 04:02:10,780
I'm leaving.

7922
04:02:11,120 --> 04:02:12,480
I'm not looking at the ride.

7923
04:02:16,200 --> 04:02:17,420
Support, stop peeling!

7924
04:02:19,120 --> 04:02:19,600
Stop!

7925
04:02:19,980 --> 04:02:20,180
No!

7926
04:02:20,520 --> 04:02:21,240
Not the ride!

7927
04:02:21,440 --> 04:02:21,800
I went down!

7928
04:02:21,800 --> 04:02:24,460
No, Ryan is just following us.

7929
04:02:25,200 --> 04:02:26,860
Hey, doobie.

7930
04:02:27,400 --> 04:02:29,660
I like how we both just like ran away.

7931
04:02:34,020 --> 04:02:34,660
Nice.

7932
04:02:40,020 --> 04:02:40,660
Okay.

7933
04:02:41,060 --> 04:02:41,380
No!

7934
04:02:41,900 --> 04:02:43,020
Stupid Ryan!

7935
04:02:45,180 --> 04:02:45,820
No!

7936
04:02:47,840 --> 04:02:50,400
Ryan fucked up my... Oh, okay.

7937
04:02:50,600 --> 04:02:51,920
And then he just did that.

7938
04:02:52,280 --> 04:02:53,960
He just killed everybody.

7939
04:02:55,960 --> 04:02:58,280
Aww, I had such a good ult!

7940
04:02:59,700 --> 04:03:00,680
I'm so sad.

7941
04:03:03,560 --> 04:03:05,740
I'm just playing hide and seek with him.

7942
04:03:05,760 --> 04:03:05,920
We'll get it back.

7943
04:03:06,080 --> 04:03:06,340
We'll get it back.

7944
04:03:06,400 --> 04:03:07,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I believe.

7945
04:03:08,840 --> 04:03:10,320
I'm just gonna flank here.

7946
04:03:11,820 --> 04:03:13,020
I don't wanna get near him.

7947
04:03:13,120 --> 04:03:14,180
I've been trying to distract him.

7948
04:03:14,280 --> 04:03:16,380
It was easier on the first area, but... Yeah.

7949
04:03:17,800 --> 04:03:19,200
Oh, our... No, our tank.

7950
04:03:21,780 --> 04:03:22,740
I can't pull DPS!

7951
04:03:25,400 --> 04:03:26,540
Don't let him get near me!

7952
04:03:28,980 --> 04:03:29,780
Alright, dead.

7953
04:03:30,220 --> 04:03:31,480
Okay, I got... I got two.

7954
04:03:31,680 --> 04:03:32,080
I got three.

7955
04:03:33,180 --> 04:03:34,320
Oh my god, there we go.

7956
04:03:34,680 --> 04:03:35,060
Nice!

7957
04:03:35,800 --> 04:03:36,420
That's right.

7958
04:03:36,500 --> 04:03:37,020
We have one.

7959
04:03:37,160 --> 04:03:38,860
Can't run away from me!

7960
04:03:39,780 --> 04:03:41,000
Oh my god, there he is.

7961
04:03:45,180 --> 04:03:46,300
Oh my god, there's...

7962
04:03:46,300 --> 04:03:46,440
Oh my god, there's...

7963
04:03:46,440 --> 04:03:46,800
I got one!

7964
04:03:50,940 --> 04:03:52,360
He doesn't know I'm here.

7965
04:03:53,560 --> 04:03:55,060
Oh my god, he does!

7966
04:04:00,490 --> 04:04:01,370
Oh, I got him!

7967
04:04:01,610 --> 04:04:02,050
I got Cas.

7968
04:04:04,130 --> 04:04:04,590
Nice!

7969
04:04:04,970 --> 04:04:05,570
Oh, I got...

7970
04:04:05,570 --> 04:04:06,170
Not nice.

7971
04:04:07,270 --> 04:04:07,730
Not!

7972
04:04:08,210 --> 04:04:08,650
No!

7973
04:04:08,890 --> 04:04:09,470
Oh my god, I got him!

7974
04:04:13,020 --> 04:04:15,260
Oh my god, I'm downloading Reaper.

7975
04:04:15,740 --> 04:04:17,080
I've downloaded him.

7976
04:04:18,020 --> 04:04:19,960
I don't know how I'm living.

7977
04:04:20,160 --> 04:04:20,940
It just took a while.

7978
04:04:21,120 --> 04:04:22,440
Yeah, it just took a while.

7979
04:04:22,660 --> 04:04:23,800
I figured it out.

7980
04:04:26,080 --> 04:04:28,440
My algorithm only gets stronger.

7981
04:04:29,040 --> 04:04:30,320
With more new data.

7982
04:04:32,000 --> 04:04:33,120
I'm just like Grok.

7983
04:04:34,180 --> 04:04:35,220
The Doki AI.

7984
04:04:35,540 --> 04:04:37,180
The Doki AI, yeah.

7985
04:04:38,680 --> 04:04:40,000
I'm locked in now.

7986
04:04:42,200 --> 04:04:43,860
Overwatch does look different now.

7987
04:04:44,160 --> 04:04:45,160
Like, the abilities are different.

7988
04:04:45,320 --> 04:04:49,640
I don't know if that's because I haven't played too much Overwatch 2, or if it just looks different in this game mode.

7989
04:04:49,720 --> 04:04:53,680
I think, like, it's like less cluttered too, I feel like, in general.

7990
04:04:55,900 --> 04:04:56,500
Let's see.

7991
04:04:57,140 --> 04:04:58,860
I don't need advanced.

7992
04:04:59,080 --> 04:04:59,580
Wait, what's that?

7993
04:05:00,120 --> 04:05:01,540
Okay, we need more weapon power.

7994
04:05:01,820 --> 04:05:03,740
We always need more weapon power.

7995
04:05:04,600 --> 04:05:06,260
Okay, now I should be unstoppable.

7996
04:05:08,280 --> 04:05:10,320
What is everybody else's build?

7997
04:05:11,120 --> 04:05:12,120
Jesus Christ.

7998
04:05:12,660 --> 04:05:15,080
Their soldier is so ta- Um...

7999
04:05:15,080 --> 04:05:18,160
The soldier in Mora has, like, insane ability power.

8000
04:05:19,680 --> 04:05:20,240
Aw.

8001
04:05:21,560 --> 04:05:25,200
Like, the soldier in Helix Rocket does so much damage because of it.

8002
04:05:28,720 --> 04:05:29,680
Yeah, yeah.

8003
04:05:31,020 --> 04:05:33,060
Reinhardt's, um, his little- What is that?

8004
04:05:33,160 --> 04:05:33,700
The strike?

8005
04:05:34,220 --> 04:05:34,400
Yeah.

8006
04:05:34,540 --> 04:05:35,320
There's so much damage.

8007
04:05:35,540 --> 04:05:35,660
Yeah.

8008
04:05:36,120 --> 04:05:36,180
It's scary.

8009
04:05:36,600 --> 04:05:39,360
It's so, like, he can, like, basically one-shot with it too.

8010
04:05:39,780 --> 04:05:41,040
That's why it's so fucking scary.

8011
04:05:41,380 --> 04:05:42,640
Yeah, that's- That's how I died.

8012
04:05:43,880 --> 04:05:45,700
That's why- Yeah, that's why I stopped fighting him.

8013
04:05:45,800 --> 04:05:47,600
I was like, you can- You can deal with Reinhardt.

8014
04:05:47,760 --> 04:05:49,520
I'm just gonna go in the backline.

8015
04:05:51,940 --> 04:05:54,020
I'm just gonna fly away now.

8016
04:05:55,580 --> 04:05:56,500
Hey, don't worry.

8017
04:05:56,620 --> 04:05:57,680
You have your meatball.

8018
04:05:57,860 --> 04:05:58,980
You'll be safe in that.

8019
04:05:59,920 --> 04:06:01,540
You'll be safe in your meatball.

8020
04:06:01,680 --> 04:06:02,000
Don't worry.

8021
04:06:02,000 --> 04:06:02,820
Yeah, yeah.

8022
04:06:03,200 --> 04:06:05,120
I'm a little tankier, so...

8023
04:06:05,120 --> 04:06:05,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

8024
04:06:05,440 --> 04:06:06,040
I believe.

8025
04:06:06,120 --> 04:06:06,800
I'll take it.

8026
04:06:07,040 --> 04:06:08,020
I believe in you.

8027
04:06:10,740 --> 04:06:14,140
Oh, I should've kept my- I should've kept my- Oh my god!

8028
04:06:14,240 --> 04:06:16,060
The Rein is purposely- He's coming for me.

8029
04:06:16,480 --> 04:06:17,760
He's actually coming for me.

8030
04:06:22,310 --> 04:06:22,830
He's dead.

8031
04:06:22,890 --> 04:06:23,070
He's dead.

8032
04:06:23,250 --> 04:06:23,670
Oh, nice.

8033
04:06:24,090 --> 04:06:25,150
No more fear.

8034
04:06:25,990 --> 04:06:26,930
No fear now.

8035
04:06:28,970 --> 04:06:29,570
Oh, sorry.

8036
04:06:29,650 --> 04:06:30,150
I pushed him away.

8037
04:06:30,250 --> 04:06:30,530
My bad.

8038
04:06:30,610 --> 04:06:31,030
Oh, it's fine.

8039
04:06:31,910 --> 04:06:32,730
I pushed one away.

8040
04:06:32,730 --> 04:06:33,910
Wait, no one's capping.

8041
04:06:35,590 --> 04:06:36,890
No one's capping.

8042
04:06:37,610 --> 04:06:38,830
Oh my god, it's fine.

8043
04:06:38,990 --> 04:06:39,310
We got one.

8044
04:06:39,430 --> 04:06:40,130
I think it's got it.

8045
04:06:40,530 --> 04:06:42,350
Is that English?

8046
04:06:45,710 --> 04:06:47,030
Okay, I'm going behind them.

8047
04:06:47,150 --> 04:06:47,630
We got it.

8048
04:06:48,550 --> 04:06:49,510
Are you guys okay?

8049
04:06:49,990 --> 04:06:50,090
Oh.

8050
04:06:51,130 --> 04:06:52,530
You guys might not be okay.

8051
04:06:55,070 --> 04:06:55,550
No!

8052
04:06:55,950 --> 04:06:57,670
You got killed, you fucking cheater!

8053
04:06:58,970 --> 04:06:59,890
What's that like?

8054
04:07:07,360 --> 04:07:09,080
Oh my god, they're all playing together now.

8055
04:07:09,280 --> 04:07:10,000
So it's harder.

8056
04:07:11,300 --> 04:07:11,780
Oh!

8057
04:07:20,280 --> 04:07:21,080
Fucking speed away!

8058
04:07:21,140 --> 04:07:22,140
I didn't have to push him back!

8059
04:07:25,120 --> 04:07:25,900
Teleport away!

8060
04:07:27,140 --> 04:07:28,540
I am so far!

8061
04:07:28,780 --> 04:07:29,860
I'm so far!

8062
04:07:29,920 --> 04:07:30,440
I'm so far!

8063
04:07:30,440 --> 04:07:31,300
I'm so far from this!

8064
04:07:31,360 --> 04:07:32,280
How did that hit me?

8065
04:07:34,620 --> 04:07:35,360
That's fine.

8066
04:07:35,660 --> 04:07:36,180
Oh!

8067
04:07:36,180 --> 04:07:36,780
I'm getting red.

8068
04:07:36,880 --> 04:07:37,140
It's okay.

8069
04:07:37,340 --> 04:07:37,620
Hello.

8070
04:07:37,620 --> 04:07:38,060
Hello.

8071
04:07:38,480 --> 04:07:38,780
Hello.

8072
04:07:39,180 --> 04:07:39,440
Welcome back.

8073
04:07:40,520 --> 04:07:41,440
Welcome back.

8074
04:07:42,480 --> 04:07:43,480
Welcome back.

8075
04:07:43,760 --> 04:07:44,140
I...

8076
04:07:44,140 --> 04:07:45,660
They all ran away from my ult.

8077
04:07:45,840 --> 04:07:46,420
That's okay.

8078
04:07:48,220 --> 04:07:49,440
Oh my god.

8079
04:07:49,960 --> 04:07:51,040
I'm okay.

8080
04:07:53,840 --> 04:07:56,380
I'm still vaguely okay.

8081
04:07:56,600 --> 04:07:57,080
I don't know.

8082
04:07:57,480 --> 04:07:57,760
Wow.

8083
04:07:58,100 --> 04:07:59,480
We got 1099.

8084
04:08:00,080 --> 04:08:01,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

8085
04:08:01,260 --> 04:08:02,340
That's all that matters.

8086
04:08:02,640 --> 04:08:04,940
I am still alive somehow.

8087
04:08:04,940 --> 04:08:05,660
Okay.

8088
04:08:09,310 --> 04:08:10,610
Oh my god.

8089
04:08:11,910 --> 04:08:13,110
Stop healing him!

8090
04:08:13,110 --> 04:08:14,070
Stop healing him!

8091
04:08:14,070 --> 04:08:14,150
Stop healing him!

8092
04:08:23,460 --> 04:08:24,680
Oh my god.

8093
04:08:25,000 --> 04:08:25,320
Oh my god.

8094
04:08:25,320 --> 04:08:26,660
Is everybody okay?

8095
04:08:31,140 --> 04:08:32,520
I don't know what this is.

8096
04:08:32,520 --> 04:08:33,260
I'm so dead.

8097
04:08:33,520 --> 04:08:34,680
I'm so dead here.

8098
04:08:35,620 --> 04:08:36,700
I'm so dead!

8099
04:08:36,920 --> 04:08:38,320
I'm so alive!

8100
04:08:38,840 --> 04:08:41,060
I just noticed this Ryan's name.

8101
04:08:41,440 --> 04:08:42,640
Wait, what is this Ryan?

8102
04:08:43,140 --> 04:08:46,700
Oh my god.

8103
04:08:47,060 --> 04:08:48,600
I'm so dead.

8104
04:08:48,860 --> 04:08:50,300
I am not gonna live here.

8105
04:08:50,300 --> 04:08:52,000
I'm actually not gonna live.

8106
04:08:52,380 --> 04:08:53,140
Thank you.

8107
04:08:53,620 --> 04:08:54,140
JK.

8108
04:08:54,360 --> 04:08:55,500
We're almost there.

8109
04:08:55,740 --> 04:08:56,460
We're almost there.

8110
04:08:56,640 --> 04:08:56,920
We're almost there.

8111
04:09:00,120 --> 04:09:01,320
I don't understand.

8112
04:09:01,320 --> 04:09:02,740
They won't let me get close.

8113
04:09:06,380 --> 04:09:07,220
Where is the...

8114
04:09:07,220 --> 04:09:07,720
Oh, there is one.

8115
04:09:07,960 --> 04:09:08,440
Oh my god.

8116
04:09:08,540 --> 04:09:08,740
Please.

8117
04:09:09,640 --> 04:09:09,980
Nice!

8118
04:09:10,560 --> 04:09:11,080
No!

8119
04:09:11,140 --> 04:09:11,440
I got two!

8120
04:09:11,520 --> 04:09:11,860
I got two!

8121
04:09:14,440 --> 04:09:15,660
You guys got this!

8122
04:09:16,780 --> 04:09:17,900
Oh my god!

8123
04:09:18,120 --> 04:09:19,020
Nice bunny hop!

8124
04:09:19,540 --> 04:09:19,800
No!

8125
04:09:20,220 --> 04:09:20,400
Oh!

8126
04:09:20,960 --> 04:09:21,620
He's low!

8127
04:09:21,720 --> 04:09:22,060
He's low!

8128
04:09:22,460 --> 04:09:22,620
No!

8129
04:09:23,060 --> 04:09:23,460
I got him!

8130
04:09:23,500 --> 04:09:24,020
I got him!

8131
04:09:24,140 --> 04:09:24,620
I got him!

8132
04:09:24,620 --> 04:09:25,040
I'm a hero!

8133
04:09:27,960 --> 04:09:28,400
What?

8134
04:09:30,660 --> 04:09:31,700
He's living forever!

8135
04:09:32,200 --> 04:09:33,460
There's one chick left, right?

8136
04:09:36,240 --> 04:09:36,680
I...

8137
04:09:36,680 --> 04:09:37,380
I got him!

8138
04:09:39,100 --> 04:09:40,320
Oh, you guys got it, yeah.

8139
04:09:41,400 --> 04:09:42,340
Moira's back!

8140
04:09:42,800 --> 04:09:43,180
I got him too!

8141
04:09:44,780 --> 04:09:45,680
Jesus Christ!

8142
04:09:45,880 --> 04:09:46,040
Okay!

8143
04:09:46,660 --> 04:09:47,240
We did it!

8144
04:09:47,500 --> 04:09:47,580
Oh, easy!

8145
04:09:49,420 --> 04:09:50,360
Okay, that's good!

8146
04:09:50,800 --> 04:09:51,500
We did it!

8147
04:09:51,780 --> 04:09:52,080
Yeah!

8148
04:09:52,900 --> 04:09:53,340
Oh!

8149
04:09:54,740 --> 04:09:55,660
I don't know!

8150
04:09:55,780 --> 04:09:56,680
I don't know!

8151
04:09:56,840 --> 04:09:58,140
I lived for so long!

8152
04:09:58,140 --> 04:10:02,160
Like, I literally was just playing, like, mouse and cat, like, everywhere!

8153
04:10:04,800 --> 04:10:06,280
You should see my P.O.P.

8154
04:10:06,300 --> 04:10:08,360
I was literally running around the map!

8155
04:10:08,600 --> 04:10:10,100
I don't know how I lived!

8156
04:10:11,980 --> 04:10:14,000
Oh, the Ryan got to play in the game!

8157
04:10:14,400 --> 04:10:15,340
Okay, no, he deserved it!

8158
04:10:15,420 --> 04:10:16,720
That guy was fucking crazy!

8159
04:10:16,980 --> 04:10:19,240
Like, like, like, I- Look how far away it was!

8160
04:10:19,380 --> 04:10:20,540
I was literally- Sweating!

8161
04:10:20,540 --> 04:10:22,940
All the way on the- At the edge!

8162
04:10:23,120 --> 04:10:24,300
At the end of that ult!

8163
04:10:27,000 --> 04:10:29,520
Yeah, like, all the- That's crazy how far it went!

8164
04:10:29,620 --> 04:10:31,690
Yeah, that was a fucking crazy range!

8165
04:10:32,660 --> 04:10:33,880
Holy sh- Oh my god!

8166
04:10:33,980 --> 04:10:35,680
We've been playing for four hours!

8167
04:10:36,700 --> 04:10:37,120
Yeah!

8168
04:10:37,820 --> 04:10:37,940
Fuck!

8169
04:10:38,700 --> 04:10:39,960
That was fun though!

8170
04:10:40,040 --> 04:10:41,040
Cause we're flying so fast!

8171
04:10:41,240 --> 04:10:41,860
You wanna do LG?

8172
04:10:42,320 --> 04:10:43,260
You should try tank!

8173
04:10:43,460 --> 04:10:43,900
For LG!

8174
04:10:44,200 --> 04:10:44,660
What's that?

8175
04:10:44,960 --> 04:10:45,720
Oh, last game!

8176
04:10:46,740 --> 04:10:47,400
What's LG?

8177
04:10:47,660 --> 04:10:48,920
Oh, that means last game!

8178
04:10:49,060 --> 04:10:49,620
You should try tank!

8179
04:10:50,140 --> 04:10:51,660
Cause you didn't get a chance to do tank!

8180
04:10:51,880 --> 04:10:52,500
I'll play!

8181
04:10:53,520 --> 04:10:53,940
Alright!

8182
04:10:54,640 --> 04:10:59,940
I'll do support and- If I get support and then the range is like crazy, that'd be good!

8183
04:11:00,280 --> 04:11:01,640
Actually, no, I shouldn't do that to you!

8184
04:11:01,940 --> 04:11:02,120
Alright!

8185
04:11:04,720 --> 04:11:06,400
I'll QS and DAT- I'll Q DPS!

8186
04:11:08,340 --> 04:11:08,780
Alright!

8187
04:11:09,800 --> 04:11:10,240
Okay!

8188
04:11:10,840 --> 04:11:11,080
Alright!

8189
04:11:11,520 --> 04:11:12,500
Let's go LG!

8190
04:11:13,720 --> 04:11:16,100
Oh, I got my- My rank and DPS!

8191
04:11:16,400 --> 04:11:16,580
Oh!

8192
04:11:16,680 --> 04:11:17,280
What's your rank?

8193
04:11:19,620 --> 04:11:20,580
They're ranked up, I think!

8194
04:11:21,040 --> 04:11:21,200
Oh!

8195
04:11:21,740 --> 04:11:23,060
Yeah, you start from bronze, right?

8196
04:11:23,080 --> 04:11:23,320
Yeah, yeah!

8197
04:11:23,400 --> 04:11:24,020
Oh, you ranked up!

8198
04:11:24,020 --> 04:11:24,740
I think it went up once!

8199
04:11:25,140 --> 04:11:25,380
Oh!

8200
04:11:25,660 --> 04:11:25,920
Nice!

8201
04:11:27,760 --> 04:11:28,860
I think so!

8202
04:11:29,800 --> 04:11:30,240
Alright!

8203
04:11:30,820 --> 04:11:31,180
Maybe!

8204
04:11:32,220 --> 04:11:33,540
I'm still not sure how it works!

8205
04:11:33,540 --> 04:11:33,880
I believe you!

8206
04:11:34,100 --> 04:11:35,140
I believe in you!

8207
04:11:35,880 --> 04:11:37,080
Alright, I'll do CAS again!

8208
04:11:39,400 --> 04:11:40,260
What are you gonna do?

8209
04:11:40,440 --> 04:11:40,720
Orisa?

8210
04:11:41,500 --> 04:11:42,380
I don't know...

8211
04:11:42,380 --> 04:11:44,960
I kinda wanna play Orisa or D.Va.

8212
04:11:45,060 --> 04:11:45,540
I'm not sure...

8213
04:11:46,140 --> 04:11:46,960
Is there D.Va?

8214
04:11:47,000 --> 04:11:47,920
Oh, the D.Va is in there!

8215
04:11:48,060 --> 04:11:48,260
Yeah!

8216
04:11:48,520 --> 04:11:49,160
I'll let chat pick!

8217
04:11:49,500 --> 04:11:50,220
Yeah, chat!

8218
04:11:50,740 --> 04:11:51,180
Yeah!

8219
04:11:51,700 --> 04:11:52,560
Pick for Doobie!

8220
04:11:53,780 --> 04:11:55,040
No, they're gonna pick a D.Va.

8221
04:11:55,760 --> 04:11:56,200
Cause...

8222
04:11:56,200 --> 04:11:57,780
Of all the, you know...

8223
04:11:57,780 --> 04:11:57,960
Oh!

8224
04:12:02,420 --> 04:12:03,440
Your little minions!

8225
04:12:04,880 --> 04:12:06,340
Your little minions!

8226
04:12:06,900 --> 04:12:07,440
What do they want?

8227
04:12:09,300 --> 04:12:11,200
Minion sounds like a nickname for them.

8228
04:12:11,320 --> 04:12:13,180
Like, it's not like their actual name.

8229
04:12:14,220 --> 04:12:15,340
How about...

8230
04:12:15,340 --> 04:12:16,560
What do you think of that chat?

8231
04:12:16,740 --> 04:12:17,580
Alright, minions!

8232
04:12:18,080 --> 04:12:18,460
Minbies!

8233
04:12:19,440 --> 04:12:20,400
So it's like min...

8234
04:12:20,400 --> 04:12:20,720
Let's game minions!

8235
04:12:21,640 --> 04:12:23,220
Let's game my minions!

8236
04:12:30,180 --> 04:12:32,000
I'm gonna read all these abilities.

8237
04:12:32,000 --> 04:12:32,720
Alright.

8238
04:12:33,260 --> 04:12:34,740
I don't even remember what was good.

8239
04:12:35,860 --> 04:12:37,360
Attack speed...

8240
04:12:37,360 --> 04:12:38,280
Ability?

8241
04:12:38,640 --> 04:12:38,920
Power?

8242
04:12:40,880 --> 04:12:42,680
Is it Deadman Walking?

8243
04:12:45,800 --> 04:12:46,240
Yeah.

8244
04:12:48,440 --> 04:12:48,980
Min birds?

8245
04:12:49,200 --> 04:12:49,800
Mini Ds?

8246
04:12:49,960 --> 04:12:50,500
God!

8247
04:12:51,040 --> 04:12:52,020
Mini Ds!

8248
04:12:55,460 --> 04:12:58,460
I feel like it's too many syllables.

8249
04:12:59,340 --> 04:13:00,100
That's true.

8250
04:13:05,780 --> 04:13:06,520
It's like...

8251
04:13:11,860 --> 04:13:13,640
I don't know, it sounds...

8252
04:13:14,120 --> 04:13:15,340
Hello, D.Vs.

8253
04:13:15,400 --> 04:13:15,600
It sounds like a...

8254
04:13:15,600 --> 04:13:16,220
Offensive or something.

8255
04:13:16,400 --> 04:13:17,500
The D.Vs!

8256
04:13:18,880 --> 04:13:21,100
What does it sound like to you?!

8257
04:13:23,240 --> 04:13:25,880
Well, growing up, my brother used to be like...

8258
04:13:25,880 --> 04:13:27,320
I don't know, I don't even know what I'm saying.

8259
04:13:27,580 --> 04:13:27,940
What do we say?

8260
04:13:28,080 --> 04:13:28,540
What do we say?

8261
04:13:28,540 --> 04:13:28,600
What do we say?

8262
04:13:28,840 --> 04:13:30,140
I'm calling me, kind of.

8263
04:13:30,840 --> 04:13:35,580
It's like... you make a noise and it implies something like...

8264
04:13:40,240 --> 04:13:41,360
It's messed up!

8265
04:13:43,080 --> 04:13:44,520
Wait, I forgot to buy something.

8266
04:13:44,760 --> 04:13:46,180
Oh no, it's too late.

8267
04:13:47,500 --> 04:13:49,520
You're gonna go in, go in, take.

8268
04:13:50,080 --> 04:13:50,780
Go in raw.

8269
04:13:57,830 --> 04:13:59,750
Alright, I believe in you.

8270
04:14:02,610 --> 04:14:04,090
Wait, I am tank, I forgot.

8271
04:14:04,330 --> 04:14:04,370
Okay.

8272
04:14:04,470 --> 04:14:04,790
Okay.

8273
04:14:05,090 --> 04:14:06,070
Oh, they went D.Va.

8274
04:14:07,330 --> 04:14:08,210
They're like...

8275
04:14:14,150 --> 04:14:15,510
Oh, I got their cast.

8276
04:14:15,930 --> 04:14:16,110
Haha!

8277
04:14:16,830 --> 04:14:17,850
Oh, they got rezzed.

8278
04:14:18,670 --> 04:14:19,250
No more, haha.

8279
04:14:20,190 --> 04:14:24,150
Oh my god, he has the power up where there's like million names.

8280
04:14:25,650 --> 04:14:26,090
Namura!

8281
04:14:29,370 --> 04:14:30,650
I'm just damage farming.

8282
04:14:33,730 --> 04:14:35,630
Oh, the castle so... No!

8283
04:14:36,230 --> 04:14:36,350
Yeah!

8284
04:14:38,070 --> 04:14:39,270
There's our healer.

8285
04:14:39,270 --> 04:14:39,890
I don't know!

8286
04:14:40,210 --> 04:14:41,390
Where did she go?

8287
04:14:44,210 --> 04:14:45,990
I don't even know where she went.

8288
04:14:47,330 --> 04:14:48,490
Nice Genji skin.

8289
04:14:50,270 --> 04:14:53,820
I feel like when they got rid of loot boxes, the skins like...

8290
04:14:54,270 --> 04:14:55,450
got upgraded so much.

8291
04:14:56,510 --> 04:14:58,610
To be fair, you need to pay real money for them.

8292
04:14:59,650 --> 04:15:00,150
Yeah.

8293
04:15:01,690 --> 04:15:04,870
They have to look really good so people will actually spend money.

8294
04:15:07,930 --> 04:15:11,530
Of course they go D.Va when I'm fucking hit skin.

8295
04:15:11,890 --> 04:15:12,970
Have you bought a skin?

8296
04:15:13,350 --> 04:15:13,810
Nah.

8297
04:15:14,270 --> 04:15:16,790
I haven't bought skins other than Fortnite skins.

8298
04:15:18,770 --> 04:15:20,270
Because it's like...

8299
04:15:20,270 --> 04:15:21,350
I had a problem.

8300
04:15:21,750 --> 04:15:22,090
I actually...

8301
04:15:22,450 --> 04:15:23,030
Oh my god.

8302
04:15:23,370 --> 04:15:24,590
Fucking D.Va.

8303
04:15:25,010 --> 04:15:26,130
Stupid mech.

8304
04:15:28,530 --> 04:15:32,010
Now I know why people hate D.Va as a hit scan.

8305
04:15:32,710 --> 04:15:39,970
But I had an actual problem with spending money when it comes to cosmetics.

8306
04:15:41,450 --> 04:15:41,530
Yeah.

8307
04:15:41,850 --> 04:15:45,930
And then I spent so much on Overwatch loot boxes.

8308
04:15:47,210 --> 04:15:47,690
Uh...

8309
04:15:47,690 --> 04:15:47,710
Wow.

8310
04:15:47,730 --> 04:15:48,230
And like...

8311
04:15:48,230 --> 04:15:49,130
Where I would spend like...

8312
04:15:49,130 --> 04:15:50,410
Maybe like...

8313
04:15:50,410 --> 04:15:51,690
A hundred dollars.

8314
04:15:52,070 --> 04:15:53,030
Per like...

8315
04:15:53,030 --> 04:15:53,370
Yeah.

8316
04:15:53,730 --> 04:15:54,790
Per event or some shit.

8317
04:15:55,190 --> 04:15:55,850
And it was so...

8318
04:15:55,850 --> 04:15:56,590
It was so bad.

8319
04:15:56,590 --> 04:15:57,490
Um...

8320
04:15:57,490 --> 04:15:57,990
And then...

8321
04:15:57,990 --> 04:15:58,730
And then...

8322
04:15:58,730 --> 04:15:58,890
You know...

8323
04:15:58,890 --> 04:15:59,870
Overwatch started dying.

8324
04:16:00,110 --> 04:16:00,950
And I realized like...

8325
04:16:00,950 --> 04:16:01,030
Wait.

8326
04:16:01,110 --> 04:16:02,370
That was such a waste of money.

8327
04:16:03,870 --> 04:16:04,770
So I...

8328
04:16:04,770 --> 04:16:05,610
So I...

8329
04:16:05,610 --> 04:16:07,230
I managed to stop spending...

8330
04:16:07,230 --> 04:16:08,490
I like...

8331
04:16:08,490 --> 04:16:10,550
Made myself stop spending money for cosmetics.

8332
04:16:10,830 --> 04:16:11,630
Other than...

8333
04:16:11,630 --> 04:16:12,890
Other than Fortnite.

8334
04:16:13,210 --> 04:16:14,550
Because Fortnite is actually...

8335
04:16:14,550 --> 04:16:15,230
Pretty silly.

8336
04:16:15,850 --> 04:16:17,470
I like the Fortnite skins more.

8337
04:16:18,350 --> 04:16:18,690
Yeah.

8338
04:16:19,750 --> 04:16:21,210
Fortnite's all about the skins.

8339
04:16:21,390 --> 04:16:21,570
Yeah.

8340
04:16:22,170 --> 04:16:22,430
Yeah.

8341
04:16:22,430 --> 04:16:23,390
I felt like that too.

8342
04:16:23,710 --> 04:16:25,710
Like Fortnite's all about like the memes and stuff.

8343
04:16:25,710 --> 04:16:27,390
And like the dances and emotes.

8344
04:16:27,470 --> 04:16:28,670
And Overwatch is like...

8345
04:16:28,670 --> 04:16:29,670
I don't really...

8346
04:16:29,670 --> 04:16:31,590
Especially Overwatch because it's like first person.

8347
04:16:31,890 --> 04:16:33,430
So I don't see the skins too.

8348
04:16:33,930 --> 04:16:34,130
A lot.

8349
04:16:34,510 --> 04:16:35,890
Unless you play third person.

8350
04:16:36,270 --> 04:16:36,670
But...

8351
04:16:36,670 --> 04:16:37,410
That doesn't count.

8352
04:16:37,610 --> 04:16:38,150
Yeah, that's true.

8353
04:16:40,170 --> 04:16:41,050
Yeah, that's a good point.

8354
04:16:41,150 --> 04:16:42,210
With Fortnite, you can see your skin.

8355
04:16:42,390 --> 04:16:43,010
Like at all times.

8356
04:16:44,450 --> 04:16:44,730
That's...

8357
04:16:44,730 --> 04:16:45,130
Oh my god.

8358
04:16:45,290 --> 04:16:45,470
I whiffed.

8359
04:16:45,470 --> 04:16:46,510
Oh, the Cassidy's so low.

8360
04:16:46,650 --> 04:16:47,330
I know.

8361
04:16:47,490 --> 04:16:48,670
I got the 1hp.

8362
04:16:48,810 --> 04:16:49,650
And then I whiffed.

8363
04:16:49,990 --> 04:16:50,770
I whiffed.

8364
04:16:50,790 --> 04:16:51,450
The moment.

8365
04:16:51,670 --> 04:16:52,730
The most important moment.

8366
04:16:53,690 --> 04:16:54,450
Wait, that's a...

8367
04:16:54,450 --> 04:16:54,590
Oh.

8368
04:16:55,970 --> 04:16:56,410
Nevermind.

8369
04:16:56,550 --> 04:16:58,030
We lost both our supports.

8370
04:17:01,430 --> 04:17:02,330
Yeah, we went.

8371
04:17:02,630 --> 04:17:03,690
I was gonna say.

8372
04:17:03,810 --> 04:17:05,390
If you tied the bomb, you're fat.

8373
04:17:05,570 --> 04:17:07,350
And then both our supports die.

8374
04:17:07,910 --> 04:17:08,790
Holy shit.

8375
04:17:10,130 --> 04:17:10,890
That's unlucky.

8376
04:17:11,290 --> 04:17:12,150
Quick, someone...

8377
04:17:12,150 --> 04:17:12,210
Maybe because I didn't...

8378
04:17:12,210 --> 04:17:12,910
I didn't back up.

8379
04:17:13,050 --> 04:17:14,070
So maybe they didn't back up.

8380
04:17:14,190 --> 04:17:14,450
I don't know.

8381
04:17:14,610 --> 04:17:16,070
Quick, someone swapped to Strange.

8382
04:17:17,970 --> 04:17:19,710
Swapped to Strange at TPS.

8383
04:17:19,710 --> 04:17:19,790
Yes.

8384
04:17:21,110 --> 04:17:21,810
Do they...

8385
04:17:21,810 --> 04:17:23,790
There's nobody in this game that has like portal abilities.

8386
04:17:24,490 --> 04:17:24,710
Are there?

8387
04:17:25,090 --> 04:17:25,270
No.

8388
04:17:26,010 --> 04:17:26,450
Symmetra.

8389
04:17:27,030 --> 04:17:27,470
Symmetra.

8390
04:17:27,850 --> 04:17:28,470
And me?

8391
04:17:29,110 --> 04:17:29,550
Yeah.

8392
04:17:29,850 --> 04:17:31,190
But do people really play her?

8393
04:17:31,410 --> 04:17:31,730
No.

8394
04:17:33,250 --> 04:17:35,210
I wish I could play Symmetra right now.

8395
04:17:35,430 --> 04:17:36,770
God, I can't believe it.

8396
04:17:36,770 --> 04:17:38,350
Why didn't you go diva?

8397
04:17:38,750 --> 04:17:40,050
I can't have fun!

8398
04:17:41,950 --> 04:17:43,670
No, we're gonna upgrade our stuff.

8399
04:17:43,970 --> 04:17:44,650
And we're gonna get them.

8400
04:17:44,850 --> 04:17:45,050
Yeah.

8401
04:17:45,070 --> 04:17:46,570
Yeah, we're gonna fucking get them.

8402
04:17:48,270 --> 04:17:49,890
Yeah, I'll do lifesteal here.

8403
04:17:51,350 --> 04:17:52,190
Oh, ammo.

8404
04:17:52,270 --> 04:17:53,970
I almost forgot ammo was important here.

8405
04:17:54,750 --> 04:17:55,570
Uh, what?

8406
04:17:55,750 --> 04:17:57,310
Guys, where is ammo in?

8407
04:17:57,550 --> 04:17:58,730
Is ammo in...

8408
04:17:59,530 --> 04:18:00,530
Is it a weapon?

8409
04:18:00,830 --> 04:18:01,570
Oh, there it is.

8410
04:18:03,710 --> 04:18:04,190
Uh...

8411
04:18:04,190 --> 04:18:04,950
I'll get more ammo.

8412
04:18:09,230 --> 04:18:09,830
Uh...

8413
04:18:09,830 --> 04:18:11,370
The arena is ready and waiting.

8414
04:18:11,630 --> 04:18:12,970
20 seconds to go.

8415
04:18:13,210 --> 04:18:13,810
Uh...

8416
04:18:13,810 --> 04:18:16,190
I don't even remember what OG Symmetra was like.

8417
04:18:17,890 --> 04:18:18,870
Me neither.

8418
04:18:19,110 --> 04:18:19,370
Yeah!

8419
04:18:19,610 --> 04:18:21,950
Does she still have the little turret things?

8420
04:18:22,370 --> 04:18:22,510
Her kid...

8421
04:18:22,510 --> 04:18:22,890
I don't remember.

8422
04:18:23,190 --> 04:18:24,070
No, I...

8423
04:18:24,070 --> 04:18:24,770
Don't remember.

8424
04:18:25,530 --> 04:18:25,850
She...

8425
04:18:25,850 --> 04:18:26,690
I remember her kid...

8426
04:18:26,690 --> 04:18:29,170
Her kid changed like four different times.

8427
04:18:29,690 --> 04:18:29,910
Yeah.

8428
04:18:30,410 --> 04:18:31,190
I don't remember.

8429
04:18:31,190 --> 04:18:32,130
It's been so long.

8430
04:18:32,350 --> 04:18:33,510
What was she like before?

8431
04:18:34,790 --> 04:18:35,990
A microwave...

8432
04:18:35,990 --> 04:18:36,930
Oh, yeah!

8433
04:18:37,310 --> 04:18:37,590
Oh, yeah!

8434
04:18:37,850 --> 04:18:38,090
Her...

8435
04:18:38,090 --> 04:18:38,830
Her...

8436
04:18:38,830 --> 04:18:40,530
Left leg used to follow you.

8437
04:18:41,870 --> 04:18:42,350
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

8438
04:18:42,830 --> 04:18:44,250
Yeah, it was like a...

8439
04:18:44,250 --> 04:18:44,730
Uh...

8440
04:18:44,730 --> 04:18:45,410
Microwave.

8441
04:18:46,770 --> 04:18:47,930
Hurts at one HP.

8442
04:18:48,070 --> 04:18:48,790
Did it really?

8443
04:18:48,950 --> 04:18:49,690
Oh, my God.

8444
04:18:49,870 --> 04:18:50,830
That sounds terrible.

8445
04:18:52,530 --> 04:18:53,550
It sounds like a...

8446
04:18:53,550 --> 04:18:57,090
This Cassidy is so lucky he doesn't have a fucking D.Va on his ass.

8447
04:19:00,630 --> 04:19:02,030
I wish that were me.

8448
04:19:05,430 --> 04:19:06,330
Oh, my God.

8449
04:19:08,030 --> 04:19:08,470
Stupid.

8450
04:19:09,170 --> 04:19:10,410
I see you, Mercy.

8451
04:19:10,590 --> 04:19:10,970
Oh, nice.

8452
04:19:11,290 --> 04:19:11,850
We got the Mercy.

8453
04:19:13,050 --> 04:19:15,290
Get that stupid baby D.Va.

8454
04:19:16,270 --> 04:19:17,430
Alright, we got him.

8455
04:19:17,610 --> 04:19:17,810
Yeah.

8456
04:19:18,810 --> 04:19:19,710
Okay, it's just...

8457
04:19:19,710 --> 04:19:21,350
That D.Va being a problem.

8458
04:19:21,610 --> 04:19:21,870
Oh, that thingy over there.

8459
04:19:23,410 --> 04:19:24,690
That D.Va...

8460
04:19:24,690 --> 04:19:26,510
He's blocking all my shots.

8461
04:19:29,030 --> 04:19:29,870
Yeah, but I feel...

8462
04:19:29,870 --> 04:19:32,590
I feel like my upgrades help with...

8463
04:19:32,590 --> 04:19:33,170
Against her.

8464
04:19:33,290 --> 04:19:34,190
Yeah, it does.

8465
04:19:34,910 --> 04:19:36,210
I'm not going back up there.

8466
04:19:36,210 --> 04:19:37,870
There's like five people there.

8467
04:19:38,110 --> 04:19:39,210
I'm like...

8468
04:19:39,850 --> 04:19:40,410
Holy shit.

8469
04:19:41,950 --> 04:19:42,930
That's not fair.

8470
04:19:43,050 --> 04:19:45,390
They're playing together like a team or something.

8471
04:19:48,950 --> 04:19:50,170
It's not fair.

8472
04:19:54,560 --> 04:19:55,440
Okay, nice.

8473
04:19:59,570 --> 04:20:00,490
What the fuck?

8474
04:20:00,590 --> 04:20:01,930
There was that Mercy over there too.

8475
04:20:05,170 --> 04:20:06,270
Oh, my God.

8476
04:20:06,590 --> 04:20:08,450
They're not letting me push up.

8477
04:20:08,450 --> 04:20:09,370
Wait.

8478
04:20:09,550 --> 04:20:10,610
If you guys can...

8479
04:20:13,310 --> 04:20:13,870
Goddammit.

8480
04:20:13,990 --> 04:20:14,930
Defense make tricks.

8481
04:20:15,230 --> 04:20:15,310
Ooh.

8482
04:20:15,570 --> 04:20:16,190
Oh, no!

8483
04:20:18,890 --> 04:20:19,910
Damage out of nowhere.

8484
04:20:21,150 --> 04:20:21,710
No!

8485
04:20:22,070 --> 04:20:22,450
Mercy!

8486
04:20:23,630 --> 04:20:24,630
Get out of here.

8487
04:20:27,050 --> 04:20:28,270
Oh, my God, no.

8488
04:20:28,570 --> 04:20:29,050
Oh, no.

8489
04:20:29,830 --> 04:20:32,750
No, I died.

8490
04:20:32,930 --> 04:20:33,510
Stop getting it.

8491
04:20:33,510 --> 04:20:33,850
She got Battle Mercy.

8492
04:20:34,790 --> 04:20:35,100
No!

8493
04:20:36,850 --> 04:20:38,080
And then she rezzed.

8494
04:20:38,610 --> 04:20:39,470
Oh, my God.

8495
04:20:39,770 --> 04:20:41,790
I worked so hard for that kill.

8496
04:20:42,810 --> 04:20:43,030
I...

8497
04:20:43,030 --> 04:20:45,770
I found the hammer and everything.

8498
04:20:46,450 --> 04:20:46,990
What the fuck?

8499
04:20:47,810 --> 04:20:48,650
Oh, my...

8500
04:20:51,410 --> 04:20:52,490
That's unlucky.

8501
04:20:54,050 --> 04:20:55,270
This is not fair.

8502
04:20:56,470 --> 04:20:57,490
Oh, my God, please!

8503
04:20:57,490 --> 04:20:58,130
I just...

8504
04:20:58,130 --> 04:20:59,010
Respond!

8505
04:21:01,710 --> 04:21:03,510
Stupid defense matrix shit.

8506
04:21:06,820 --> 04:21:08,160
I can't push that.

8507
04:21:09,060 --> 04:21:10,440
I'm just a little guy.

8508
04:21:11,240 --> 04:21:12,120
I'm here.

8509
04:21:12,320 --> 04:21:13,920
I'm just a little guy.

8510
04:21:14,140 --> 04:21:14,820
I can't push it.

8511
04:21:15,960 --> 04:21:17,680
Where the fuck is our Genji blade?

8512
04:21:21,700 --> 04:21:22,260
Serious?

8513
04:21:23,180 --> 04:21:24,080
Where's the ship?

8514
04:21:28,030 --> 04:21:28,370
Damnit!

8515
04:21:28,470 --> 04:21:28,910
Nobody's here.

8516
04:21:29,090 --> 04:21:29,430
Okay.

8517
04:21:29,570 --> 04:21:30,210
Okay, I got it.

8518
04:21:30,350 --> 04:21:30,710
I get...

8519
04:21:30,710 --> 04:21:31,130
Here we go.

8520
04:21:34,230 --> 04:21:34,830
Here we go.

8521
04:21:36,770 --> 04:21:37,470
Get out of here.

8522
04:21:37,570 --> 04:21:38,250
Get out of here!

8523
04:21:39,110 --> 04:21:39,450
Alright.

8524
04:21:39,570 --> 04:21:39,810
Nice.

8525
04:21:39,990 --> 04:21:40,210
Oh, wait.

8526
04:21:40,330 --> 04:21:41,010
There's someone on point.

8527
04:21:43,570 --> 04:21:43,910
Huh?

8528
04:21:45,730 --> 04:21:46,370
We got it.

8529
04:21:46,470 --> 04:21:46,830
We got it.

8530
04:21:47,790 --> 04:21:48,130
Nice.

8531
04:21:48,290 --> 04:21:48,590
We got it.

8532
04:21:48,670 --> 04:21:48,870
Nice.

8533
04:21:49,250 --> 04:21:50,270
And we got Jared in overtime.

8534
04:21:50,510 --> 04:21:50,730
Yeah!

8535
04:21:51,010 --> 04:21:51,890
We win that round!

8536
04:21:53,390 --> 04:21:54,430
Oh, thank God.

8537
04:21:54,430 --> 04:21:56,130
Thank fucking God.

8538
04:21:56,870 --> 04:21:58,330
I got scared there.

8539
04:21:58,650 --> 04:22:00,270
We gotta win our last one!

8540
04:22:00,630 --> 04:22:00,810
Yes.

8541
04:22:01,070 --> 04:22:02,050
We gotta win our LG.

8542
04:22:02,950 --> 04:22:03,630
Oh, my God.

8543
04:22:03,690 --> 04:22:05,230
Our D.Va is so free, too.

8544
04:22:05,730 --> 04:22:06,650
Because of our...

8545
04:22:06,650 --> 04:22:07,130
Alright.

8546
04:22:07,470 --> 04:22:08,290
I mean, that's...

8547
04:22:08,290 --> 04:22:09,150
I guess, like...

8548
04:22:09,150 --> 04:22:14,710
Yeah, it's all about strategizing, because we can't counterpick, so we have to fucking figure out our builds in general.

8549
04:22:17,090 --> 04:22:18,430
After using combat...

8550
04:22:19,010 --> 04:22:23,010
I can imagine for, like, higher level stuff, it gets crazy.

8551
04:22:23,250 --> 04:22:23,470
Yeah.

8552
04:22:24,670 --> 04:22:25,950
Guys, what do I do?

8553
04:22:26,350 --> 04:22:27,350
I don't know.

8554
04:22:27,810 --> 04:22:27,950
At...

8555
04:22:27,950 --> 04:22:29,390
At Grok, what do I do?

8556
04:22:31,950 --> 04:22:32,870
Do I have nothing?

8557
04:22:33,430 --> 04:22:33,690
No.

8558
04:22:34,130 --> 04:22:35,150
I need weapons.

8559
04:22:39,930 --> 04:22:40,510
Oh...

8560
04:22:41,240 --> 04:22:42,630
It's a fierce competition.

8561
04:22:42,890 --> 04:22:44,550
Who will cave to the pressure?

8562
04:22:44,770 --> 04:22:46,730
And who will come out on top?

8563
04:22:47,010 --> 04:22:47,490
Okay.

8564
04:22:48,530 --> 04:22:49,110
Win.

8565
04:22:49,110 --> 04:22:49,230
Win.

8566
04:22:49,550 --> 04:22:50,030
Haha.

8567
04:22:50,970 --> 04:22:51,250
Guys.

8568
04:22:51,830 --> 04:22:52,090
Oh.

8569
04:22:52,450 --> 04:22:53,470
There's armor pierce?

8570
04:22:53,990 --> 04:22:54,470
Easy clap.

8571
04:22:54,910 --> 04:22:55,490
Just win.

8572
04:22:56,030 --> 04:22:56,510
Doki.

8573
04:22:58,650 --> 04:22:59,130
Okay.

8574
04:22:59,250 --> 04:23:01,010
But what do I do for a power, guys?

8575
04:23:01,310 --> 04:23:02,110
Action begins.

8576
04:23:03,930 --> 04:23:04,670
Commander click.

8577
04:23:04,830 --> 04:23:05,590
The fuck is that?

8578
04:23:08,270 --> 04:23:09,370
Guys, that's nothing in here.

8579
04:23:09,510 --> 04:23:09,650
Okay.

8580
04:23:10,310 --> 04:23:10,790
Uh...

8581
04:23:10,790 --> 04:23:11,530
Oh, shoot.

8582
04:23:13,990 --> 04:23:14,370
Uh...

8583
04:23:15,110 --> 04:23:16,230
I'm gonna do auto-aim.

8584
04:23:17,090 --> 04:23:18,590
I don't have to think about aiming now.

8585
04:23:20,490 --> 04:23:21,510
Oh, damn it.

8586
04:23:21,770 --> 04:23:23,550
Haha, you couldn't figure out two.

8587
04:23:26,070 --> 04:23:27,050
Pick the one that let you win.

8588
04:23:27,050 --> 04:23:29,030
I was gonna buy, like, one more thing, but then it's fine.

8589
04:23:29,270 --> 04:23:29,650
It's fine.

8590
04:23:29,810 --> 04:23:30,090
It's okay.

8591
04:23:30,370 --> 04:23:31,550
Just like a small item thingy.

8592
04:23:31,550 --> 04:23:32,770
Yeah, we don't need it.

8593
04:23:33,250 --> 04:23:34,150
We're too good for it.

8594
04:23:36,710 --> 04:23:39,250
I don't even remember what ability power-up thingy I picked.

8595
04:23:40,710 --> 04:23:41,250
It's okay.

8596
04:23:41,370 --> 04:23:42,690
We'll read it next round, you know?

8597
04:23:42,930 --> 04:23:44,170
We'll just read it next round.

8598
04:23:45,970 --> 04:23:46,770
I'm still...

8599
04:23:46,770 --> 04:23:47,210
It's hard...

8600
04:23:47,210 --> 04:23:48,130
It's a lot to absorb.

8601
04:23:48,650 --> 04:23:50,950
Playing this game mode for the first time.

8602
04:23:51,630 --> 04:23:52,110
What the hell?

8603
04:23:56,840 --> 04:23:57,640
Oh my god!

8604
04:23:57,760 --> 04:23:59,640
They all came back?!

8605
04:24:00,240 --> 04:24:00,760
No!

8606
04:24:01,260 --> 04:24:02,280
No, it's okay!

8607
04:24:02,600 --> 04:24:03,860
I deserved that!

8608
04:24:04,080 --> 04:24:05,120
No, I deserved it!

8609
04:24:05,240 --> 04:24:05,860
I didn't...

8610
04:24:05,860 --> 04:24:06,360
I...

8611
04:24:06,360 --> 04:24:06,920
I don't know.

8612
04:24:07,060 --> 04:24:10,380
I thought they would stop giving a fuck about the Ash, but...

8613
04:24:10,380 --> 04:24:10,560
I...

8614
04:24:10,560 --> 04:24:10,800
They...

8615
04:24:10,800 --> 04:24:14,160
Rez the Ash and their entire team came back to protect the Rez.

8616
04:24:14,900 --> 04:24:15,160
Check.

8617
04:24:16,880 --> 04:24:17,400
Ah...

8618
04:24:17,400 --> 04:24:17,820
Like...

8619
04:24:17,820 --> 04:24:20,200
It's like they're, like, calming or some shit.

8620
04:24:20,460 --> 04:24:23,640
I bet you the Ash was screaming and the microphone be like...

8621
04:24:24,720 --> 04:24:26,020
They're like, he's...

8622
04:24:26,020 --> 04:24:26,560
Kill him!

8623
04:24:26,760 --> 04:24:27,700
He's right there!

8624
04:24:28,020 --> 04:24:29,080
There's no way!

8625
04:24:29,340 --> 04:24:29,960
Fuck you!

8626
04:24:30,100 --> 04:24:30,660
Six...

8627
04:24:30,660 --> 04:24:32,800
Six players not in voice comps!

8628
04:24:32,840 --> 04:24:34,080
It's insane that shit!

8629
04:24:36,380 --> 04:24:39,460
There's no way an entire team just looked at it.

8630
04:24:39,520 --> 04:24:41,080
Yeah, but maybe they're also, like, uh...

8631
04:24:41,660 --> 04:24:42,380
Maybe stacking.

8632
04:24:43,040 --> 04:24:46,140
Isn't the Q in this game, it's like, if you're in a stack, you go against...

8633
04:24:46,780 --> 04:24:47,600
Ah, sometimes.

8634
04:24:47,600 --> 04:24:48,600
I'm like, getting away from these people.

8635
04:24:48,680 --> 04:24:49,800
It's a lot of damage.

8636
04:24:50,800 --> 04:24:51,760
Not always.

8637
04:24:52,840 --> 04:24:54,080
And then Rez.

8638
04:24:55,060 --> 04:24:56,360
I'm dying so fast!

8639
04:24:56,860 --> 04:24:57,180
Oh!

8640
04:24:59,740 --> 04:25:00,320
Fucking knew.

8641
04:25:00,420 --> 04:25:01,560
I fucking knew you were gonna Rez.

8642
04:25:01,700 --> 04:25:01,940
I...

8643
04:25:01,940 --> 04:25:02,320
Knew it.

8644
04:25:06,220 --> 04:25:07,040
Oh my god.

8645
04:25:07,160 --> 04:25:08,080
All they do is Rez.

8646
04:25:13,060 --> 04:25:13,460
No!

8647
04:25:20,680 --> 04:25:21,900
Oh my god.

8648
04:25:22,540 --> 04:25:23,340
They are...

8649
04:25:23,650 --> 04:25:25,000
Stop protecting them!

8650
04:25:25,640 --> 04:25:27,820
We both got killed by mercy!

8651
04:25:29,260 --> 04:25:30,020
It's okay.

8652
04:25:30,520 --> 04:25:31,820
I believe in our team.

8653
04:25:31,820 --> 04:25:33,760
I feel like, as a tank, I'm not doing that good.

8654
04:25:33,920 --> 04:25:34,460
Sorry.

8655
04:25:34,980 --> 04:25:36,020
No, you're doing fine.

8656
04:25:36,340 --> 04:25:36,880
It's...

8657
04:25:36,880 --> 04:25:38,340
It's hard to stay alive.

8658
04:25:38,340 --> 04:25:39,080
Oh.

8659
04:25:39,080 --> 04:25:39,520
What?

8660
04:25:40,100 --> 04:25:40,960
Oh my god.

8661
04:25:41,420 --> 04:25:41,440
What?

8662
04:25:42,280 --> 04:25:42,780
How?

8663
04:25:43,900 --> 04:25:44,420
What?

8664
04:25:44,920 --> 04:25:45,600
Where...

8665
04:25:47,550 --> 04:25:48,250
Seven...

8666
04:25:48,250 --> 04:25:48,830
I was...

8667
04:25:48,830 --> 04:25:49,410
Okay.

8668
04:25:49,950 --> 04:25:50,630
My...

8669
04:25:50,630 --> 04:25:50,730
What?

8670
04:25:51,050 --> 04:25:51,730
My...

8671
04:25:51,730 --> 04:25:54,070
I like, actually disappeared for some reason.

8672
04:25:54,610 --> 04:25:55,230
I...

8673
04:25:55,230 --> 04:25:55,630
That's...

8674
04:25:55,630 --> 04:25:55,970
Okay.

8675
04:25:56,090 --> 04:25:58,610
I wish you saw what happened to me.

8676
04:25:58,790 --> 04:25:59,810
It was actually crazy.

8677
04:25:59,810 --> 04:26:01,570
It was crazy.

8678
04:26:05,100 --> 04:26:05,740
Okay.

8679
04:26:05,880 --> 04:26:07,220
I killed...

8680
04:26:08,120 --> 04:26:08,760
Okay.

8681
04:26:08,920 --> 04:26:10,680
I sacrificed myself for this.

8682
04:26:11,000 --> 04:26:11,880
So like...

8683
04:26:11,880 --> 04:26:12,600
This might...

8684
04:26:12,600 --> 04:26:14,000
We might win this one area.

8685
04:26:14,600 --> 04:26:15,020
I...

8686
04:26:16,200 --> 04:26:16,840
Okay.

8687
04:26:17,600 --> 04:26:17,920
Wait.

8688
04:26:18,660 --> 04:26:21,780
I wish you saw what I saw with the D.Va bomb.

8689
04:26:22,060 --> 04:26:23,300
It was actually bullshit.

8690
04:26:23,720 --> 04:26:23,840
Oh.

8691
04:26:26,040 --> 04:26:28,340
I like, disappeared from existence.

8692
04:26:37,000 --> 04:26:37,500
Alright.

8693
04:26:38,060 --> 04:26:39,160
It's not over yet.

8694
04:26:39,380 --> 04:26:40,400
I hear no bell.

8695
04:26:40,700 --> 04:26:40,800
Yep.

8696
04:26:41,100 --> 04:26:41,260
Yeah.

8697
04:26:41,700 --> 04:26:42,640
I hear no bell.

8698
04:26:45,440 --> 04:26:46,860
Fucking clear side D.Va's here.

8699
04:26:52,380 --> 04:26:53,340
Is that Mercy?

8700
04:26:53,720 --> 04:26:54,040
Like...

8701
04:26:54,040 --> 04:26:54,180
Yeah.

8702
04:26:54,320 --> 04:26:54,840
I was gonna say.

8703
04:26:55,300 --> 04:26:55,440
Yeah.

8704
04:26:56,460 --> 04:26:57,320
There you go.

8705
04:26:57,440 --> 04:26:58,280
She's low, she's low.

8706
04:26:58,280 --> 04:26:58,540
I got her.

8707
04:26:58,720 --> 04:26:59,300
I got her.

8708
04:27:04,160 --> 04:27:05,100
Oh my god.

8709
04:27:05,420 --> 04:27:05,800
No!

8710
04:27:06,620 --> 04:27:08,160
I almost killed the cat.

8711
04:27:08,160 --> 04:27:09,300
It lasted for so long.

8712
04:27:09,380 --> 04:27:09,740
I know!

8713
04:27:10,340 --> 04:27:10,380
What the hell?

8714
04:27:10,800 --> 04:27:12,820
I almost killed the cat too.

8715
04:27:13,020 --> 04:27:13,600
And then...

8716
04:27:14,940 --> 04:27:17,120
And then the ash booped me into him.

8717
04:27:17,740 --> 04:27:18,800
I'm so sad.

8718
04:27:19,540 --> 04:27:20,940
I got booped into it.

8719
04:27:21,280 --> 04:27:22,400
I'm coming back now.

8720
04:27:24,020 --> 04:27:24,940
It's winnable.

8721
04:27:25,260 --> 04:27:25,320
I'm behind ya.

8722
04:27:25,480 --> 04:27:26,120
Nevermind.

8723
04:27:27,520 --> 04:27:28,160
Um...

8724
04:27:29,020 --> 04:27:30,300
It might not be winnable.

8725
04:27:30,740 --> 04:27:32,460
I'm pretty squishy too.

8726
04:27:33,800 --> 04:27:34,440
Shoot.

8727
04:27:34,440 --> 04:27:34,520
Shoot.

8728
04:27:34,760 --> 04:27:35,240
Shoot.

8729
04:27:36,160 --> 04:27:37,280
Oh my god.

8730
04:27:37,420 --> 04:27:37,960
I'm so sad.

8731
04:27:38,200 --> 04:27:39,780
I almost killed that cat.

8732
04:27:43,560 --> 04:27:44,660
We'll get it.

8733
04:27:44,780 --> 04:27:45,040
We'll get it.

8734
04:27:45,300 --> 04:27:45,640
It's okay.

8735
04:27:46,040 --> 04:27:46,500
Next round.

8736
04:27:46,640 --> 04:27:47,040
Next round.

8737
04:27:47,240 --> 04:27:47,720
It's close.

8738
04:27:47,900 --> 04:27:48,620
It's a close game.

8739
04:27:49,960 --> 04:27:50,460
Yeah.

8740
04:27:54,360 --> 04:27:55,520
Oh my god.

8741
04:27:55,520 --> 04:27:57,660
I wish I had a mercy pocket.

8742
04:27:58,160 --> 04:27:58,800
I thought this would be better for us.

8743
04:27:59,180 --> 04:27:59,540
I thought this would be better for us.

8744
04:28:00,620 --> 04:28:03,320
I got stupid cats with a mercy pocket.

8745
04:28:12,060 --> 04:28:13,480
I'm gonna do more...

8746
04:28:13,480 --> 04:28:14,860
I'm gonna do more weapon power.

8747
04:28:17,340 --> 04:28:17,900
Yeah.

8748
04:28:18,360 --> 04:28:18,560
Same.

8749
04:28:19,060 --> 04:28:20,140
Yeah, that's the...

8750
04:28:20,140 --> 04:28:21,320
One thing that's good.

8751
04:28:22,780 --> 04:28:23,760
And then more...

8752
04:28:23,760 --> 04:28:24,320
There's so many...

8753
04:28:24,320 --> 04:28:25,800
There's so many different things to buy.

8754
04:28:25,980 --> 04:28:26,380
Yeah.

8755
04:28:26,740 --> 04:28:27,580
It's like...

8756
04:28:27,580 --> 04:28:28,120
There's like...

8757
04:28:28,120 --> 04:28:28,540
A lot.

8758
04:28:31,120 --> 04:28:31,760
Oh...

8759
04:28:31,760 --> 04:28:33,000
Armor pierce.

8760
04:28:33,160 --> 04:28:34,440
There's an armor pierce?

8761
04:28:39,760 --> 04:28:40,500
Armory damage.

8762
04:28:41,900 --> 04:28:43,220
No armor pierce?

8763
04:28:43,340 --> 04:28:44,120
What the fuck is it?

8764
04:28:46,020 --> 04:28:47,180
Oh my god.

8765
04:28:47,420 --> 04:28:48,360
Chat's so right.

8766
04:28:48,560 --> 04:28:49,280
Pocket Mercy.

8767
04:28:49,580 --> 04:28:50,240
Pocket Diva.

8768
04:28:50,720 --> 04:28:52,100
Like, are you fucking...

8769
04:28:52,100 --> 04:28:54,060
That cat says everything!

8770
04:28:55,700 --> 04:28:56,340
Yeah.

8771
04:28:56,340 --> 04:28:58,500
Where's my pocket Mercy?

8772
04:28:59,000 --> 04:29:00,220
And pocket Diva?

8773
04:29:02,760 --> 04:29:04,300
Are our healers dying?

8774
04:29:04,760 --> 04:29:05,320
They're...

8775
04:29:05,320 --> 04:29:06,380
Dying pretty often?

8776
04:29:06,760 --> 04:29:07,080
Yeah.

8777
04:29:07,180 --> 04:29:08,940
I'll just stay next to our healers, actually.

8778
04:29:09,340 --> 04:29:10,500
I'll stop flanking.

8779
04:29:11,660 --> 04:29:13,460
That Diva is like...

8780
04:29:13,460 --> 04:29:14,520
Just perma...

8781
04:29:14,520 --> 04:29:15,360
On me.

8782
04:29:15,920 --> 04:29:17,040
Whenever I try to flank.

8783
04:29:18,360 --> 04:29:19,080
It's like...

8784
04:29:19,080 --> 04:29:20,020
I can't really do much.

8785
04:29:20,240 --> 04:29:21,960
I'll just play in the back line, I guess.

8786
04:29:22,860 --> 04:29:26,020
All I can do is just farm the Diva Mech then.

8787
04:29:27,640 --> 04:29:28,160
I...

8788
04:29:28,160 --> 04:29:29,180
He's already dead.

8789
04:29:29,920 --> 04:29:30,440
Alright.

8790
04:29:31,240 --> 04:29:31,780
I don't know how.

8791
04:29:32,040 --> 04:29:32,060
Alright.

8792
04:29:37,780 --> 04:29:39,560
I'm just staying on point, bros.

8793
04:29:43,750 --> 04:29:44,530
Oh no!

8794
04:29:44,970 --> 04:29:45,130
No!

8795
04:29:48,010 --> 04:29:50,150
I feel like I wasn't even that far up, but...

8796
04:29:50,770 --> 04:29:51,870
Okay, well...

8797
04:29:51,870 --> 04:29:52,610
At least...

8798
04:29:52,610 --> 04:29:53,270
So much damage.

8799
04:29:53,950 --> 04:29:54,170
Yeah.

8800
04:29:54,950 --> 04:29:55,550
Heal me!

8801
04:29:55,730 --> 04:29:56,170
Heal me!

8802
04:29:57,350 --> 04:29:59,890
Our board just watched me!

8803
04:30:02,550 --> 04:30:03,310
Oh my god.

8804
04:30:03,350 --> 04:30:03,910
I swear to god.

8805
04:30:03,990 --> 04:30:04,870
I swear...

8806
04:30:04,870 --> 04:30:05,490
You think that they have...

8807
04:30:05,490 --> 04:30:07,310
Because they have a Mercy and we don't?

8808
04:30:07,550 --> 04:30:07,570
Yeah.

8809
04:30:07,810 --> 04:30:08,310
No, our...

8810
04:30:08,310 --> 04:30:10,150
Our Mora is DPSing.

8811
04:30:11,430 --> 04:30:11,950
She...

8812
04:30:11,950 --> 04:30:15,430
I was literally next to her, and then she just looked at me.

8813
04:30:15,870 --> 04:30:15,950
Oh.

8814
04:30:15,950 --> 04:30:16,410
I...

8815
04:30:16,410 --> 04:30:18,170
I'm just like, are you serious?

8816
04:30:21,210 --> 04:30:21,730
I'm...

8817
04:30:21,730 --> 04:30:22,630
Oh no.

8818
04:30:23,050 --> 04:30:23,450
Our...

8819
04:30:23,450 --> 04:30:26,250
Our Juno isn't healing either.

8820
04:30:26,890 --> 04:30:28,850
She has 200 fucking heals.

8821
04:30:28,850 --> 04:30:29,910
That's crazy.

8822
04:30:30,830 --> 04:30:31,310
That's...

8823
04:30:31,310 --> 04:30:31,950
I...

8824
04:30:31,950 --> 04:30:33,770
Our Juno has 200 heals!

8825
04:30:35,250 --> 04:30:36,430
I feel like I'm not...

8826
04:30:36,430 --> 04:30:37,750
I'm not getting any healing, right?

8827
04:30:37,910 --> 04:30:37,990
Yeah.

8828
04:30:38,270 --> 04:30:38,490
No, no.

8829
04:30:38,690 --> 04:30:41,210
Press stab and see how much heals our Juno has done.

8830
04:30:41,930 --> 04:30:42,410
It's...

8831
04:30:42,410 --> 04:30:43,930
It's actually no heals.

8832
04:30:44,430 --> 04:30:44,490
Oh.

8833
04:30:45,190 --> 04:30:45,550
Oh.

8834
04:30:46,710 --> 04:30:47,330
Oh my god.

8835
04:30:47,930 --> 04:30:48,250
How do...

8836
04:30:48,250 --> 04:30:49,570
How have I done more healing?

8837
04:30:49,890 --> 04:30:50,690
I know, right?

8838
04:30:50,930 --> 04:30:51,150
No!

8839
04:30:51,270 --> 04:30:52,330
Of course it's Diva's here!

8840
04:30:55,210 --> 04:30:56,170
He doesn't...

8841
04:30:56,170 --> 04:30:56,450
No!

8842
04:30:56,690 --> 04:30:57,610
He saw me!

8843
04:31:00,590 --> 04:31:01,150
What?

8844
04:31:02,450 --> 04:31:03,010
400?!

8845
04:31:03,590 --> 04:31:06,390
How is this Juno with 400 heals?!

8846
04:31:06,390 --> 04:31:08,010
I got her said!

8847
04:31:10,070 --> 04:31:12,850
I tried to touch point, but yeah, I can't even get close.

8848
04:31:13,130 --> 04:31:13,290
Yeah.

8849
04:31:13,990 --> 04:31:16,230
I think it's just unfortunate teammates.

8850
04:31:17,470 --> 04:31:17,550
Right!

8851
04:31:17,550 --> 04:31:19,170
We just don't have good...

8852
04:31:19,170 --> 04:31:21,350
We don't have people as teammates.

8853
04:31:21,750 --> 04:31:22,330
We have AI.

8854
04:31:25,450 --> 04:31:26,730
I can't believe it.

8855
04:31:26,770 --> 04:31:27,950
Now we have four AI's.

8856
04:31:27,950 --> 04:31:28,850
Is that a thing that Overwatch does?

8857
04:31:29,150 --> 04:31:29,270
No.

8858
04:31:30,030 --> 04:31:30,750
Quick play, yeah.

8859
04:31:30,950 --> 04:31:32,830
Apparently there's like, bots in quick play.

8860
04:31:33,290 --> 04:31:33,690
Hey!

8861
04:31:34,490 --> 04:31:36,090
We have four AI's.

8862
04:31:36,710 --> 04:31:36,930
Ah.

8863
04:31:39,010 --> 04:31:39,450
Hey!

8864
04:31:42,490 --> 04:31:43,090
It's okay.

8865
04:31:43,250 --> 04:31:44,210
But we're the ones that...

8866
04:31:44,210 --> 04:31:45,030
We're the good AI's.

8867
04:31:45,110 --> 04:31:45,910
We're not the cheap ones.

8868
04:31:46,090 --> 04:31:46,750
We actually learn.

8869
04:31:49,310 --> 04:31:49,870
Okay.

8870
04:31:51,890 --> 04:31:52,810
We're the one...

8871
04:31:52,810 --> 04:31:53,750
We're the learning AI.

8872
04:31:55,410 --> 04:31:56,310
Oh my god.

8873
04:31:56,450 --> 04:31:58,050
I don't know what to do with art...

8874
04:31:58,050 --> 04:31:58,630
Art...

8875
04:31:58,630 --> 04:31:59,410
Art...

8876
04:31:59,410 --> 04:32:00,730
Art supports.

8877
04:32:08,270 --> 04:32:09,790
Look at this.

8878
04:32:10,130 --> 04:32:11,530
I'll just do more weapon power.

8879
04:32:11,810 --> 04:32:12,250
Honestly.

8880
04:32:13,750 --> 04:32:14,450
Oh no.

8881
04:32:14,530 --> 04:32:17,650
I feel like I can't do anything with D.Va and Mercy Pocket.

8882
04:32:20,150 --> 04:32:21,890
You mean when I play in the backline?

8883
04:32:22,290 --> 04:32:22,690
Some...

8884
04:32:22,690 --> 04:32:23,650
Some, uh...

8885
04:32:25,530 --> 04:32:27,870
When I play in the backline, I'm not getting healed either.

8886
04:32:30,790 --> 04:32:31,190
Yeah.

8887
04:32:32,370 --> 04:32:33,750
Do you have like, life steal?

8888
04:32:33,970 --> 04:32:35,550
I could get life steal, yeah.

8889
04:32:35,870 --> 04:32:36,630
Maybe I'll get that.

8890
04:32:39,390 --> 04:32:39,790
Uh...

8891
04:32:39,790 --> 04:32:41,550
Well, I'll get this out then.

8892
04:32:41,830 --> 04:32:45,090
Or I saw that there's some where like, when you get a kill...

8893
04:32:45,250 --> 04:32:46,250
But then again...

8894
04:32:46,250 --> 04:32:47,290
Yeah, I'm just gonna go...

8895
04:32:47,290 --> 04:32:48,490
I'm just gonna go with life steal.

8896
04:32:48,890 --> 04:32:49,670
I'm just gonna go with life steal.

8897
04:32:49,930 --> 04:32:51,750
Yeah, like, it's hard to get kills.

8898
04:32:52,010 --> 04:32:52,950
Like, oh my god.

8899
04:32:53,410 --> 04:32:57,310
The fucking Ashe has 80% damage in ability.

8900
04:32:57,430 --> 04:32:58,410
But it's hard to do, um...

8901
04:33:01,770 --> 04:33:02,170
Uh...

8902
04:33:02,170 --> 04:33:02,710
Uh...

8903
04:33:02,710 --> 04:33:03,530
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

8904
04:33:03,790 --> 04:33:06,090
Kills, because like, they're Mercy and...

8905
04:33:06,090 --> 04:33:07,770
Their supports are actually healing each other.

8906
04:33:07,970 --> 04:33:08,950
Or like, healing their team.

8907
04:33:09,530 --> 04:33:11,050
Our support is like...

8908
04:33:11,050 --> 04:33:11,330
Yeah.

8909
04:33:11,330 --> 04:33:11,750
I don't know.

8910
04:33:11,750 --> 04:33:12,590
They're...

8911
04:33:13,690 --> 04:33:14,190
They're...

8912
04:33:14,190 --> 04:33:14,610
They're...

8913
04:33:14,610 --> 04:33:15,830
They're taking a vacation right now.

8914
04:33:16,110 --> 04:33:16,610
It's their break.

8915
04:33:16,990 --> 04:33:17,290
Three...

8916
04:33:17,910 --> 04:33:18,410
Two...

8917
04:33:19,730 --> 04:33:20,230
One...

8918
04:33:20,230 --> 04:33:20,590
Right.

8919
04:33:20,810 --> 04:33:22,590
Well, I mean, school is out for the summer, so...

8920
04:33:22,590 --> 04:33:22,830
That's true.

8921
04:33:23,330 --> 04:33:25,370
It's summer vacation for our supports.

8922
04:33:28,550 --> 04:33:30,370
All I can do is just shoot D.Va.

8923
04:33:32,490 --> 04:33:34,530
I want a flank, but I can't.

8924
04:33:36,890 --> 04:33:37,970
Must be nice.

8925
04:33:40,190 --> 04:33:41,910
Oh my god, you're so low!

8926
04:33:42,370 --> 04:33:43,710
You're already so low!

8927
04:33:43,910 --> 04:33:44,230
It's crazy!

8928
04:33:44,650 --> 04:33:45,210
I got some heals.

8929
04:33:45,750 --> 04:33:46,990
Oh my god!

8930
04:33:47,610 --> 04:33:48,090
Yeah.

8931
04:33:48,690 --> 04:33:50,450
It's actually crazy how low you were.

8932
04:33:56,440 --> 04:33:56,920
Jesus.

8933
04:34:00,780 --> 04:34:02,240
I got Cass, at least.

8934
04:34:05,950 --> 04:34:08,650
Yeah, I got a survival thing that's like...

8935
04:34:08,650 --> 04:34:09,710
20%...

8936
04:34:09,710 --> 04:34:12,530
I don't know if it's 20% or 10% less damage on critical hits.

8937
04:34:12,710 --> 04:34:13,590
Which is headshots, right?

8938
04:34:14,350 --> 04:34:15,470
Oh my god.

8939
04:34:15,870 --> 04:34:17,430
I think our supports are healing us now.

8940
04:34:18,630 --> 04:34:19,850
Oh my god!

8941
04:34:21,730 --> 04:34:22,210
What?!

8942
04:34:23,010 --> 04:34:23,490
What?!

8943
04:34:27,830 --> 04:34:28,310
What?!

8944
04:34:28,310 --> 04:34:30,590
Maybe Chao was right in that making you...

8945
04:34:30,590 --> 04:34:32,210
Maybe you should pick D.Va.

8946
04:34:34,150 --> 04:34:35,530
That could've been you.

8947
04:34:35,690 --> 04:34:35,970
Yeah.

8948
04:34:36,090 --> 04:34:37,970
That could've been you on the D.Va buff.

8949
04:34:38,150 --> 04:34:39,770
He gets that so often, doesn't she?

8950
04:34:39,770 --> 04:34:40,850
I think it's just her...

8951
04:34:40,850 --> 04:34:41,390
Her ultimate.

8952
04:34:41,650 --> 04:34:43,330
She's probably buying stuff.

8953
04:34:43,630 --> 04:34:43,950
I know.

8954
04:34:44,270 --> 04:34:46,150
To be fair, she's getting heavily pocketed.

8955
04:34:46,230 --> 04:34:47,290
Like, I can't even kill her.

8956
04:34:47,890 --> 04:34:49,370
I've been shooting her all day.

8957
04:34:50,350 --> 04:34:50,610
Yeah.

8958
04:34:53,690 --> 04:34:54,210
Okay.

8959
04:35:00,210 --> 04:35:01,050
Oh my god.

8960
04:35:01,210 --> 04:35:03,750
She's D.Va matricing their fucking cast too!

8961
04:35:05,130 --> 04:35:06,110
Oh my god!

8962
04:35:06,130 --> 04:35:07,950
What is that like?!

8963
04:35:08,690 --> 04:35:09,210
How...

8964
04:35:09,210 --> 04:35:11,850
What is it like to have that much fucking protection?

8965
04:35:11,850 --> 04:35:12,010
Oh shit!

8966
04:35:12,330 --> 04:35:12,370
Oh!

8967
04:35:16,070 --> 04:35:17,130
It sucks!

8968
04:35:17,550 --> 04:35:19,450
Oh, she has a quick explosion perk.

8969
04:35:19,690 --> 04:35:21,170
So, her explosion goes...

8970
04:35:21,170 --> 04:35:22,130
Goes for...

8971
04:35:22,130 --> 04:35:23,210
Like...

8972
04:35:23,210 --> 04:35:23,890
Like...

8973
04:35:23,890 --> 04:35:24,970
Explodes faster.

8974
04:35:27,070 --> 04:35:27,710
Yeah.

8975
04:35:27,710 --> 04:35:28,430
Oh my god.

8976
04:35:33,340 --> 04:35:34,280
I'm jealous.

8977
04:35:37,340 --> 04:35:38,560
Watch this, they're gonna res her.

8978
04:35:43,740 --> 04:35:45,140
Oh my god.

8979
04:35:45,140 --> 04:35:46,620
OK, the Cassidy's dead.

8980
04:35:47,100 --> 04:35:49,400
I didn't even know where the fuck it is!

8981
04:35:53,640 --> 04:35:55,200
Oh my god!

8982
04:35:55,340 --> 04:35:55,700
Goodbye!

8983
04:35:55,920 --> 04:35:56,640
Raid boss down!

8984
04:35:57,100 --> 04:35:57,940
Raid boss down!

8985
04:35:59,240 --> 04:36:01,060
Oh my god, doesn't matter!

8986
04:36:01,280 --> 04:36:02,620
She gets healed!

8987
04:36:07,080 --> 04:36:13,040
It's okay, I got the... Oh my god, look at all the resources they're putting on the baby diva!

8988
04:36:13,480 --> 04:36:16,360
Please, actually let the baby die!

8989
04:36:19,020 --> 04:36:20,640
Let her die!

8990
04:36:26,220 --> 04:36:28,020
Oh my god, please.

8991
04:36:28,460 --> 04:36:28,820
Please.

8992
04:36:31,740 --> 04:36:32,980
That can't be our LG.

8993
04:36:33,140 --> 04:36:34,240
Do we do another?

8994
04:36:37,540 --> 04:36:38,820
Ah, we can only one more.

8995
04:36:39,180 --> 04:36:39,540
All right.

8996
04:36:40,580 --> 04:36:41,440
LG, LG.

8997
04:36:41,540 --> 04:36:42,220
Yeah, can't end on a loss.

8998
04:36:42,460 --> 04:36:42,940
Exactly.

8999
04:36:43,980 --> 04:36:46,220
Whoa, that's a cool Cassidy skin though.

9000
04:36:46,540 --> 04:36:47,300
Which one?

9001
04:36:47,920 --> 04:36:48,960
Oh, the one I have?

9002
04:36:49,560 --> 04:36:50,520
He's like invisible.

9003
04:36:51,340 --> 04:36:53,980
Oh, oh, the invisible man one.

9004
04:36:55,780 --> 04:36:58,160
Yeah, I didn't know that was a skin.

9005
04:37:00,060 --> 04:37:01,800
Oh yeah, that was like... I don't remember.

9006
04:37:01,960 --> 04:37:04,740
That was like a special... a Halloween one.

9007
04:37:05,340 --> 04:37:05,620
All right.

9008
04:37:07,000 --> 04:37:08,220
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

9009
04:37:08,580 --> 04:37:10,300
Now I'm angry.

9010
04:37:10,860 --> 04:37:12,440
Wait, I re... I... you can re-pick.

9011
04:37:13,380 --> 04:37:15,980
I wanna... I'll try playing support since I haven't played support yet.

9012
04:37:16,020 --> 04:37:16,480
Oh, that's true.

9013
04:37:16,580 --> 04:37:19,040
Oh wait, let me... Oh, let me re-pick then.

9014
04:37:19,240 --> 04:37:21,640
I'll do the tank and... tank and damage.

9015
04:37:23,780 --> 04:37:24,300
Okay.

9016
04:37:25,900 --> 04:37:27,740
Oh, wait, what's your favorite support?

9017
04:37:28,080 --> 04:37:28,780
Oh, the diva bomb.

9018
04:37:29,100 --> 04:37:31,060
Yeah, the stupid diva bomb.

9019
04:37:33,200 --> 04:37:34,560
Oh, you gotta pick support again.

9020
04:37:34,760 --> 04:37:35,680
I like Lucio.

9021
04:37:36,420 --> 04:37:42,400
Oh, Lucio has a really good... has like a mega boop... ability.

9022
04:37:43,080 --> 04:37:45,000
I haven't seen a lot of Lucio to be fair.

9023
04:37:45,000 --> 04:37:46,100
when I was playing stadium.

9024
04:37:46,500 --> 04:37:47,460
Oh, you can play him in this game mode?

9025
04:37:47,460 --> 04:37:47,700
Yeah.

9026
04:37:47,880 --> 04:37:49,200
Yeah, I haven't seen him at all.

9027
04:37:49,600 --> 04:37:52,320
Um, the meta is Juno and Mercy.

9028
04:37:52,440 --> 04:37:53,660
Is he good to play?

9029
04:37:53,800 --> 04:37:54,520
Can I... should I try?

9030
04:37:54,840 --> 04:37:59,580
Um, he's not meta, but you'll see more Juno, Mercy, and Mora.

9031
04:38:00,120 --> 04:38:04,300
Because Juno, her E ability, you know, the one where she sends those like little missiles.

9032
04:38:04,980 --> 04:38:12,260
Um, you can... you can max it out so much that... um, on a squishy, it does like 80% damage on a squishy.

9033
04:38:12,640 --> 04:38:14,860
So they're literally almost one shot.

9034
04:38:15,140 --> 04:38:15,300
Oh.

9035
04:38:15,940 --> 04:38:17,520
That's how fucking scary it is.

9036
04:38:17,800 --> 04:38:19,760
I never played her before though.

9037
04:38:20,280 --> 04:38:21,860
I've never... this would be my first time.

9038
04:38:22,100 --> 04:38:24,540
Yeah, but uh, Mora is also really strong too.

9039
04:38:24,760 --> 04:38:25,400
I kinda wanna try Lucio though.

9040
04:38:25,660 --> 04:38:26,680
Yeah, you try Lucio.

9041
04:38:26,940 --> 04:38:27,240
Okay.

9042
04:38:27,480 --> 04:38:27,980
Try Lucio.

9043
04:38:28,880 --> 04:38:29,400
Okay.

9044
04:38:31,380 --> 04:38:34,180
I know that some people can make it work on Lucio.

9045
04:38:36,200 --> 04:38:36,680
Alright.

9046
04:38:37,180 --> 04:38:38,060
Oh my god, thank god.

9047
04:38:38,180 --> 04:38:39,380
Okay, now we have a D.Va.

9048
04:38:40,900 --> 04:38:42,020
Okay, our D.Va better.

9049
04:38:42,320 --> 04:38:43,600
I hope our D.Va lives.

9050
04:38:47,940 --> 04:38:49,200
Like, mystery man.

9051
04:38:49,200 --> 04:38:52,200
And D.Va felt kind of OP in the last game.

9052
04:38:52,320 --> 04:38:52,560
Yeah.

9053
04:38:52,880 --> 04:38:53,120
Sure.

9054
04:38:53,360 --> 04:38:54,760
Like, she couldn't die.

9055
04:38:55,120 --> 04:39:00,100
I literally, like, their Kiriko and Mercy just fucking pumped every resource into that D.Va.

9056
04:39:02,240 --> 04:39:03,980
I was like... Is this gonna be good?

9057
04:39:04,140 --> 04:39:04,820
Like, these heals?

9058
04:39:05,020 --> 04:39:05,580
Is it gonna be no?

9059
04:39:05,940 --> 04:39:07,340
Uh, it should be fine.

9060
04:39:07,600 --> 04:39:10,020
I'm pretty sure you can have... if you have ability power.

9061
04:39:10,560 --> 04:39:11,940
Ability power makes more heals.

9062
04:39:12,400 --> 04:39:12,740
Okay.

9063
04:39:13,100 --> 04:39:14,040
And stronger boops.

9064
04:39:14,480 --> 04:39:15,020
Oh, okay.

9065
04:39:15,300 --> 04:39:15,520
Yeah.

9066
04:39:16,980 --> 04:39:17,500
Gotcha.

9067
04:39:17,740 --> 04:39:18,640
I'm pretty sure it's ability.

9068
04:39:19,200 --> 04:39:21,000
Oh, they went meta.

9069
04:39:22,540 --> 04:39:23,260
Meta heals.

9070
04:39:23,260 --> 04:39:23,440
Oh, there it is.

9071
04:39:24,220 --> 04:39:24,720
Okay.

9072
04:39:25,820 --> 04:39:26,320
Uh...

9073
04:39:26,320 --> 04:39:26,460
What?

9074
04:39:26,820 --> 04:39:27,020
Okay.

9075
04:39:27,080 --> 04:39:28,480
These are example builds.

9076
04:39:28,540 --> 04:39:31,700
Picked by the pros to start our competitors off on the right.

9077
04:39:31,700 --> 04:39:32,380
I'm just gonna do this.

9078
04:39:32,900 --> 04:39:33,250
And then...

9079
04:39:36,800 --> 04:39:37,620
Back speed.

9080
04:39:37,960 --> 04:39:38,140
Alright.

9081
04:39:38,380 --> 04:39:39,060
I'm ready.

9082
04:39:39,880 --> 04:39:40,860
I'm so ready.

9083
04:39:41,960 --> 04:39:43,800
I'm locked in now, for real.

9084
04:39:44,440 --> 04:39:46,460
Wait, I should... I'm gonna grab water real quick.

9085
04:39:46,540 --> 04:39:46,860
Up or back.

9086
04:39:49,980 --> 04:39:50,340
Okay.

9087
04:39:52,380 --> 04:39:53,720
Chat, which one do I pick?

9088
04:39:53,980 --> 04:39:59,680
There's this one, which says it increases 80% projectile size, which sounds cool.

9089
04:40:00,000 --> 04:40:00,820
No, no, I'll do this one.

9090
04:40:00,960 --> 04:40:01,860
I'll do this one later.

9091
04:40:03,640 --> 04:40:06,580
Uh, yeah, I'll go with this, uh, mixtape, I think.

9092
04:40:07,620 --> 04:40:08,940
Bottom left one is good.

9093
04:40:09,820 --> 04:40:10,540
Beat drop?

9094
04:40:11,420 --> 04:40:11,740
20%.

9095
04:40:11,740 --> 04:40:12,560
Oh, wow.

9096
04:40:12,700 --> 04:40:13,320
Yeah, that is good.

9097
04:40:14,400 --> 04:40:14,920
True, true, true.

9098
04:40:15,020 --> 04:40:15,180
Okay.

9099
04:40:15,220 --> 04:40:18,000
I'll get this one now, and then I'll get this one later, and then I'll get this one later.

9100
04:40:18,600 --> 04:40:19,380
That sounds like fun.

9101
04:40:20,940 --> 04:40:21,260
Um...

9102
04:40:21,600 --> 04:40:21,920
Ability.

9103
04:40:25,140 --> 04:40:26,360
Get back in time!

9104
04:40:29,200 --> 04:40:29,520
Yeah!

9105
04:40:30,100 --> 04:40:30,960
All right, I'm ready.

9106
04:40:35,720 --> 04:40:36,640
Oh, frick.

9107
04:40:37,720 --> 04:40:38,580
What happened?

9108
04:40:40,760 --> 04:40:44,480
Now I was gonna buy something else, but it's fine.

9109
04:40:44,560 --> 04:40:45,160
I don't need it.

9110
04:40:45,760 --> 04:40:46,160
Probably.

9111
04:40:46,920 --> 04:40:49,060
Yeah, you can do it next round.

9112
04:40:51,080 --> 04:40:51,560
Yeah.

9113
04:40:51,800 --> 04:40:53,280
Yeah, it's just like a test run.

9114
04:40:54,680 --> 04:40:55,960
Might not have been good anyway.

9115
04:40:56,660 --> 04:40:58,080
Oh my god!

9116
04:40:58,380 --> 04:40:58,600
Okay.

9117
04:41:01,980 --> 04:41:02,980
Okay, I'm healed.

9118
04:41:03,180 --> 04:41:04,880
I was gonna say, I hope I get healed.

9119
04:41:05,720 --> 04:41:06,880
That'll be pretty cool.

9120
04:41:07,160 --> 04:41:08,040
I'm healing, I'm healing.

9121
04:41:12,980 --> 04:41:13,840
Oh my god!

9122
04:41:13,960 --> 04:41:14,600
Our D.Va?

9123
04:41:18,540 --> 04:41:19,440
Bashku's still low!

9124
04:41:20,100 --> 04:41:21,240
Oh my god!

9125
04:41:22,980 --> 04:41:24,300
I believe in our team.

9126
04:41:27,540 --> 04:41:28,340
That's crazy.

9127
04:41:29,020 --> 04:41:29,420
Ow.

9128
04:41:32,200 --> 04:41:32,800
Thank you.

9129
04:41:35,700 --> 04:41:36,980
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

9130
04:41:38,140 --> 04:41:39,540
Oh my god, they're so fast.

9131
04:41:40,040 --> 04:41:40,420
Whoops!

9132
04:41:40,640 --> 04:41:41,420
I stood in lava.

9133
04:41:41,660 --> 04:41:42,780
Oh, was their tank AFK?

9134
04:41:42,920 --> 04:41:44,140
I don't remember seeing their tank at all.

9135
04:41:44,480 --> 04:41:45,900
No, they died really fast.

9136
04:41:49,140 --> 04:41:49,800
Oh, okay.

9137
04:41:51,220 --> 04:41:52,440
Oh, I'm so fast!

9138
04:41:52,760 --> 04:41:53,720
I'm so fast!

9139
04:41:54,300 --> 04:41:54,620
Oh!

9140
04:41:58,760 --> 04:42:00,080
I feel so fast.

9141
04:42:00,700 --> 04:42:01,760
I'm not used to it.

9142
04:42:01,880 --> 04:42:02,720
It's been so long.

9143
04:42:03,260 --> 04:42:04,160
No, I'm healing.

9144
04:42:04,300 --> 04:42:05,120
I'm not speed boosting.

9145
04:42:05,300 --> 04:42:05,640
I'm healing.

9146
04:42:06,900 --> 04:42:08,360
I feel so fast.

9147
04:42:09,280 --> 04:42:10,420
No, I think it was the Juno.

9148
04:42:11,540 --> 04:42:12,380
It was the...

9149
04:42:12,380 --> 04:42:13,440
Oh my god!

9150
04:42:13,540 --> 04:42:14,780
Now the Juno sped me.

9151
04:42:15,020 --> 04:42:16,440
I was like disoriented.

9152
04:42:21,610 --> 04:42:22,050
Nice.

9153
04:42:23,030 --> 04:42:23,750
You did it.

9154
04:42:23,950 --> 04:42:25,690
Wait, does Juno also have like a speed boost?

9155
04:42:25,690 --> 04:42:31,610
Yeah, she sends out a ring where if you go through it, um, you go like, it gives you a mini speed boost.

9156
04:42:31,830 --> 04:42:32,130
Oh, yeah.

9157
04:42:32,390 --> 04:42:35,910
So like, it like fucked me up because I was like, I can't aim for that.

9158
04:42:37,450 --> 04:42:38,710
I was like, where am I aiming?

9159
04:42:39,030 --> 04:42:40,970
Yeah, that makes sense.

9160
04:42:41,990 --> 04:42:42,810
He's gonna charge.

9161
04:42:43,130 --> 04:42:43,950
I'm gonna try and break it though.

9162
04:42:44,930 --> 04:42:45,790
Wait, is that Reaper?

9163
04:42:47,390 --> 04:42:48,650
Oh, nice up.

9164
04:42:51,510 --> 04:42:52,890
I'm scared now.

9165
04:42:55,090 --> 04:42:55,890
Nice.

9166
04:43:00,050 --> 04:43:01,310
You're serious.

9167
04:43:04,170 --> 04:43:05,010
Oh my god.

9168
04:43:05,410 --> 04:43:07,830
Oh my god, everybody's flying too much.

9169
04:43:09,870 --> 04:43:10,670
No!

9170
04:43:11,850 --> 04:43:13,110
Yeah, I...

9171
04:43:13,110 --> 04:43:13,910
It's okay.

9172
04:43:13,910 --> 04:43:16,510
I believe I, I, uh, stopped her Juno.

9173
04:43:19,310 --> 04:43:20,170
I believe.

9174
04:43:21,330 --> 04:43:22,250
I believe.

9175
04:43:22,590 --> 04:43:24,630
Just start, just start wall riding.

9176
04:43:26,850 --> 04:43:27,410
Okay.

9177
04:43:27,950 --> 04:43:30,150
Just start running around the walls.

9178
04:43:31,370 --> 04:43:32,550
I'm coming back.

9179
04:43:34,910 --> 04:43:36,050
Oh, wait, this is 9.

9180
04:43:36,210 --> 04:43:36,310
Yay.

9181
04:43:36,650 --> 04:43:37,170
Oh, right.

9182
04:43:37,430 --> 04:43:37,590
He was on.

9183
04:43:37,790 --> 04:43:37,990
Yay.

9184
04:43:37,990 --> 04:43:38,450
Nice.

9185
04:43:39,150 --> 04:43:40,330
He got distracted, yeah.

9186
04:43:40,930 --> 04:43:41,190
Nice.

9187
04:43:42,430 --> 04:43:43,310
Oh, we're doing it.

9188
04:43:43,910 --> 04:43:45,270
Let's competition this round.

9189
04:43:48,150 --> 04:43:48,710
Oh, nice.

9190
04:43:48,850 --> 04:43:49,150
Oh!

9191
04:43:49,570 --> 04:43:51,590
Oh, I thought, uh, I was like, Winston!

9192
04:43:52,510 --> 04:43:53,770
So, when did we get our monkey?

9193
04:43:56,470 --> 04:43:57,630
I don't think I've seen Winston.

9194
04:43:58,010 --> 04:43:59,390
Winston in this game mode, I feel like, would be cool.

9195
04:44:00,270 --> 04:44:01,490
Isn't Winston in this game?

9196
04:44:02,790 --> 04:44:03,670
I'm pretty sure.

9197
04:44:04,290 --> 04:44:05,570
Uh, I don't think so.

9198
04:44:05,970 --> 04:44:06,230
Oh.

9199
04:44:08,250 --> 04:44:09,270
Yeah, I don't think so.

9200
04:44:10,550 --> 04:44:11,250
Let's see.

9201
04:44:11,450 --> 04:44:11,590
Let's see.

9202
04:44:11,710 --> 04:44:11,830
Let's see.

9203
04:44:12,730 --> 04:44:13,350
Let's see.

9204
04:44:13,350 --> 04:44:13,770
Armor.

9205
04:44:14,210 --> 04:44:14,950
No, I'll do attack speed.

9206
04:44:15,670 --> 04:44:16,610
Wait, not yet?

9207
04:44:16,810 --> 04:44:18,990
Oh, I thought I saw Winton on here.

9208
04:44:21,330 --> 04:44:21,790
Winton.

9209
04:44:22,310 --> 04:44:22,770
Winton.

9210
04:44:22,890 --> 04:44:22,970
Winton.

9211
04:44:23,690 --> 04:44:26,690
I'm pretty sure they're adding Winton next patch.

9212
04:44:26,690 --> 04:44:29,150
Or in 10 days, because season two.

9213
04:44:30,170 --> 04:44:30,690
For Stadium.

9214
04:44:32,650 --> 04:44:33,050
Oh!

9215
04:44:33,490 --> 04:44:33,850
That's great.

9216
04:44:33,970 --> 04:44:34,510
Overwatch is in...

9217
04:44:34,510 --> 04:44:35,530
So they're just gonna add more people?

9218
04:44:35,710 --> 04:44:35,770
Yeah.

9219
04:44:35,770 --> 04:44:38,010
They're not gonna switch people out or anything?

9220
04:44:38,230 --> 04:44:38,990
I think so.

9221
04:44:39,850 --> 04:44:40,930
I don't know, honestly.

9222
04:44:42,330 --> 04:44:43,250
That makes sense.

9223
04:44:44,030 --> 04:44:46,390
They have to decide, like, all the abilities and stuff.

9224
04:44:46,910 --> 04:44:50,950
Apparently, Sigma, Zen, and some EPS are gonna be in there.

9225
04:44:51,110 --> 04:44:52,210
Oh, they're swapping Sigma in.

9226
04:44:52,570 --> 04:44:52,670
Oh.

9227
04:44:53,670 --> 04:44:54,390
That's interesting.

9228
04:44:57,130 --> 04:44:59,190
I heard that, uh...

9229
04:44:59,190 --> 04:45:00,390
I heard, like...

9230
04:45:00,390 --> 04:45:03,470
You know how, like, Overwatch 2 was supposed to be PvE, um...

9231
04:45:03,470 --> 04:45:04,030
PvE?

9232
04:45:04,970 --> 04:45:05,910
I heard that...

9233
04:45:05,910 --> 04:45:05,930
Oh, yeah.

9234
04:45:06,150 --> 04:45:06,930
Yeah, I heard that...

9235
04:45:06,930 --> 04:45:07,730
Oh, I should've been high ground.

9236
04:45:07,970 --> 04:45:08,810
That it was, like...

9237
04:45:08,810 --> 04:45:13,730
They basically took, like, the stuff that was supposed to be in PvE section, and then made it turn into, uh, Stadium.

9238
04:45:17,110 --> 04:45:18,490
Which I thought was funny.

9239
04:45:18,830 --> 04:45:18,930
Yeah.

9240
04:45:20,150 --> 04:45:21,090
It makes sense, though.

9241
04:45:21,210 --> 04:45:22,490
Like, the fact that...

9242
04:45:22,490 --> 04:45:24,650
They got, like, the stuff that they want to do.

9243
04:45:26,250 --> 04:45:26,690
But...

9244
04:45:26,690 --> 04:45:28,010
But where are they?

9245
04:45:29,130 --> 04:45:30,030
But where are they?

9246
04:45:30,270 --> 04:45:31,570
This works out, then, kind of?

9247
04:45:31,690 --> 04:45:31,910
Yeah.

9248
04:45:32,410 --> 04:45:33,010
You know, at least...

9249
04:45:33,010 --> 04:45:33,930
At least there's...

9250
04:45:33,930 --> 04:45:35,050
That's where the Q comes from.

9251
04:45:39,530 --> 04:45:39,970
Crew?

9252
04:45:40,990 --> 04:45:41,870
What the fuck?

9253
04:45:42,250 --> 04:45:42,910
Oh my...

9254
04:45:42,910 --> 04:45:43,150
I don't...

9255
04:45:43,150 --> 04:45:43,450
Okay.

9256
04:45:43,850 --> 04:45:46,370
I don't know how the fuck I got the Reaper kill.

9257
04:45:47,230 --> 04:45:47,550
Oh.

9258
04:45:50,270 --> 04:45:50,590
Ow.

9259
04:45:52,810 --> 04:45:53,290
All right.

9260
04:45:53,950 --> 04:45:54,590
Oh, nice.

9261
04:45:56,750 --> 04:45:57,430
Like, when...

9262
04:45:57,430 --> 04:45:58,090
You know, like...

9263
04:45:58,090 --> 04:46:01,710
Okay, so Cassidy has an ability, uh, where, like, it gives me more ammo.

9264
04:46:02,030 --> 04:46:02,130
Uh-huh.

9265
04:46:02,130 --> 04:46:05,330
But, like, fucks with me so much, because I'm like, Oh, I should reload right now.

9266
04:46:05,750 --> 04:46:06,730
Because I can reload.

9267
04:46:06,910 --> 04:46:07,230
Yeah.

9268
04:46:07,670 --> 04:46:08,650
I'm like, wait a minute.

9269
04:46:08,710 --> 04:46:09,770
No, I have enough ammo.

9270
04:46:11,510 --> 04:46:11,970
Oh.

9271
04:46:15,230 --> 04:46:17,250
God, I have so much fucking ammo.

9272
04:46:17,450 --> 04:46:18,410
It's actually crazy.

9273
04:46:22,680 --> 04:46:23,140
Oh.

9274
04:46:23,320 --> 04:46:24,220
Oh my god, soldier!

9275
04:46:24,340 --> 04:46:25,000
What are you doing here?

9276
04:46:26,700 --> 04:46:28,500
Oh my god, and you get a pocket?

9277
04:46:34,460 --> 04:46:34,820
Nice.

9278
04:46:35,320 --> 04:46:36,940
I had to ult or else I'd die.

9279
04:46:37,440 --> 04:46:37,680
That's good.

9280
04:46:37,700 --> 04:46:38,300
It was worth it.

9281
04:46:39,400 --> 04:46:40,220
It was worth it.

9282
04:46:40,360 --> 04:46:41,220
That's fucking right.

9283
04:46:41,220 --> 04:46:41,760
No risk.

9284
04:46:41,980 --> 04:46:42,920
Okay, that run.

9285
04:46:43,160 --> 04:46:43,560
Oh, nice.

9286
04:46:43,780 --> 04:46:44,760
I was gonna say, that run has ult.

9287
04:46:46,520 --> 04:46:47,400
We did it!

9288
04:46:47,460 --> 04:46:48,340
He's getting melted.

9289
04:46:48,960 --> 04:46:49,560
Oh my god.

9290
04:46:49,700 --> 04:46:52,200
Yeah, that team died so fast.

9291
04:46:56,400 --> 04:46:57,900
Yeah, I kind of feel bad for that.

9292
04:46:58,960 --> 04:46:59,820
No, what do you do?

9293
04:46:59,860 --> 04:47:02,340
They have the, uh, little placards.

9294
04:47:02,580 --> 04:47:03,460
They play a lot, right?

9295
04:47:03,460 --> 04:47:04,020
Yeah, they do.

9296
04:47:04,360 --> 04:47:05,280
That means they play a lot.

9297
04:47:05,880 --> 04:47:06,540
Oh, they got the bottom.

9298
04:47:06,640 --> 04:47:08,040
I love the bottom 500 tag.

9299
04:47:08,200 --> 04:47:09,600
Apparently, it was an April Fool's shit.

9300
04:47:10,900 --> 04:47:11,540
Let's see.

9301
04:47:12,720 --> 04:47:13,400
What?

9302
04:47:13,880 --> 04:47:15,040
The bottom 500.

9303
04:47:16,540 --> 04:47:17,480
Let's see.

9304
04:47:18,900 --> 04:47:20,720
I still don't know, like, what...

9305
04:47:20,720 --> 04:47:21,860
Oh, not...

9306
04:47:21,860 --> 04:47:22,180
Fuck it.

9307
04:47:22,480 --> 04:47:23,740
I want auto-aim bot.

9308
04:47:28,560 --> 04:47:29,240
And...

9309
04:47:29,940 --> 04:47:31,100
Cool down reduction.

9310
04:47:40,160 --> 04:47:41,440
More weapon power.

9311
04:47:42,120 --> 04:47:43,440
Always weapon power.

9312
04:47:44,420 --> 04:47:44,980
Let's see.

9313
04:47:45,060 --> 04:47:45,100
Let's see.

9314
04:47:45,100 --> 04:47:45,920
That's 4,000.

9315
04:47:46,180 --> 04:47:47,040
5,000.

9316
04:47:50,800 --> 04:47:52,120
Actually, do I have enough?

9317
04:47:52,420 --> 04:47:53,420
No, I don't.

9318
04:47:53,560 --> 04:47:54,720
Oh, what did I buy?

9319
04:47:56,680 --> 04:47:57,420
Attack speed.

9320
04:47:58,420 --> 04:47:59,320
There's attack speed.

9321
04:47:59,780 --> 04:48:00,900
Or was it life steal?

9322
04:48:01,440 --> 04:48:02,200
Attack speed.

9323
04:48:02,780 --> 04:48:03,040
I don't know.

9324
04:48:03,100 --> 04:48:04,760
I should do a life steal or attack speed.

9325
04:48:05,740 --> 04:48:06,580
And that was it.

9326
04:48:08,180 --> 04:48:08,700
Yeah.

9327
04:48:09,280 --> 04:48:10,240
I couldn't math.

9328
04:48:10,420 --> 04:48:13,060
I thought, like, I mapped correctly for a purple upgrade.

9329
04:48:13,920 --> 04:48:15,240
It's the hardest part.

9330
04:48:15,640 --> 04:48:16,360
It's just like CS.

9331
04:48:20,420 --> 04:48:21,720
It's good for your brain.

9332
04:48:21,900 --> 04:48:22,420
It's exercise.

9333
04:48:22,800 --> 04:48:22,820
No.

9334
04:48:23,200 --> 04:48:23,940
I don't want to exercise.

9335
04:48:23,940 --> 04:48:24,320
For your brain.

9336
04:48:25,460 --> 04:48:28,360
Just put my Twitter brain right.

9337
04:48:30,640 --> 04:48:32,560
At Croc, is this real?

9338
04:48:40,180 --> 04:48:40,920
Oh my god.

9339
04:48:41,160 --> 04:48:41,700
He's so low.

9340
04:48:41,740 --> 04:48:42,100
I got her.

9341
04:48:45,610 --> 04:48:46,730
Oh my god.

9342
04:48:46,730 --> 04:48:48,290
They're dying so fast.

9343
04:48:48,450 --> 04:48:49,250
It's actually crazy.

9344
04:48:51,830 --> 04:48:52,910
I'm just gonna cap it.

9345
04:48:53,070 --> 04:48:53,750
Maybe they're...

9346
04:48:53,750 --> 04:48:54,430
I was gonna say no.

9347
04:48:54,570 --> 04:48:55,970
I was gonna say maybe they're new to this game.

9348
04:48:55,970 --> 04:48:56,850
No.

9349
04:48:57,650 --> 04:48:57,810
No.

9350
04:48:59,090 --> 04:49:00,110
There's no way.

9351
04:49:01,590 --> 04:49:02,490
There's like...

9352
04:49:02,490 --> 04:49:04,770
There's like 10 days left till the end of the season.

9353
04:49:06,170 --> 04:49:07,230
We'll be up here.

9354
04:49:08,270 --> 04:49:08,390
Hey.

9355
04:49:08,390 --> 04:49:08,450
Oh.

9356
04:49:08,990 --> 04:49:09,250
Hi.

9357
04:49:09,470 --> 04:49:09,730
Oh.

9358
04:49:11,570 --> 04:49:12,130
Oh.

9359
04:49:12,130 --> 04:49:12,230
Oh.

9360
04:49:12,410 --> 04:49:12,570
Oh.

9361
04:49:13,190 --> 04:49:13,650
Guys.

9362
04:49:13,970 --> 04:49:14,390
Guys.

9363
04:49:14,990 --> 04:49:15,590
Yo.

9364
04:49:16,530 --> 04:49:17,710
I'm okay now.

9365
04:49:18,610 --> 04:49:19,490
I'm okay.

9366
04:49:19,890 --> 04:49:20,850
I hear a soldier.

9367
04:49:23,850 --> 04:49:25,010
Where is this soldier?

9368
04:49:25,560 --> 04:49:26,350
Oh my god.

9369
04:49:26,490 --> 04:49:26,790
Bye.

9370
04:49:31,600 --> 04:49:32,440
Oh my god.

9371
04:49:32,560 --> 04:49:33,940
Why are they following me?

9372
04:49:35,820 --> 04:49:37,580
Because you're killing them.

9373
04:49:37,880 --> 04:49:38,640
You're dangerous.

9374
04:49:39,200 --> 04:49:39,740
Barely.

9375
04:49:40,320 --> 04:49:41,320
They want to get rid of you.

9376
04:49:41,320 --> 04:49:42,080
They don't even like...

9377
04:49:42,080 --> 04:49:43,420
They're not even going forward.

9378
04:49:43,760 --> 04:49:44,860
Where are they going?

9379
04:49:48,360 --> 04:49:50,460
They're not even walking forward.

9380
04:49:50,880 --> 04:49:51,940
They're walking backwards.

9381
04:49:51,960 --> 04:49:53,060
I'm so confused.

9382
04:49:58,120 --> 04:49:58,660
Okay.

9383
04:49:58,840 --> 04:49:58,960
Okay.

9384
04:49:59,000 --> 04:49:59,800
Now they're walking forward.

9385
04:49:59,800 --> 04:50:00,060
Okay.

9386
04:50:00,380 --> 04:50:01,060
Okay.

9387
04:50:03,040 --> 04:50:04,220
What the fuck?

9388
04:50:06,800 --> 04:50:08,520
Oh my god.

9389
04:50:09,080 --> 04:50:10,100
I got mercy.

9390
04:50:10,480 --> 04:50:11,760
I'll save you.

9391
04:50:12,180 --> 04:50:13,000
Oh, thank you.

9392
04:50:13,180 --> 04:50:14,020
My hero.

9393
04:50:14,600 --> 04:50:15,520
My hero.

9394
04:50:16,340 --> 04:50:16,900
Oh damn.

9395
04:50:18,020 --> 04:50:18,460
Oh my...

9396
04:50:18,460 --> 04:50:20,720
I don't know how I got that mercy.

9397
04:50:25,160 --> 04:50:26,800
That Ryan is scary.

9398
04:50:26,800 --> 04:50:28,120
Oh my god.

9399
04:50:29,040 --> 04:50:32,160
I'm so fucking glad that shit's over.

9400
04:50:36,140 --> 04:50:36,760
Okay.

9401
04:50:38,220 --> 04:50:38,440
Okay.

9402
04:50:39,540 --> 04:50:40,160
Okay.

9403
04:50:40,580 --> 04:50:40,700
Wait.

9404
04:50:40,980 --> 04:50:42,340
I think this was just the play right now.

9405
04:50:42,340 --> 04:50:42,740
Yeah, yeah.

9406
04:50:42,860 --> 04:50:43,860
Wait, do me here.

9407
04:50:44,240 --> 04:50:44,680
Before...

9408
04:50:44,680 --> 04:50:45,620
You have to...

9409
04:50:45,620 --> 04:50:45,740
Yeah.

9410
04:50:45,900 --> 04:50:51,560
You have to look at replay and then look where I was before you ulted me.

9411
04:50:51,900 --> 04:50:53,360
You have to see it.

9412
04:50:54,900 --> 04:50:56,300
No, I was watching you.

9413
04:50:56,380 --> 04:50:58,040
He was like backing you into a corner, right?

9414
04:50:58,040 --> 04:50:58,580
Yeah, yeah.

9415
04:50:58,680 --> 04:51:01,380
But you see me get randomly got the mercy kill.

9416
04:51:01,800 --> 04:51:03,240
While I was running around.

9417
04:51:03,560 --> 04:51:04,200
I didn't see it.

9418
04:51:04,320 --> 04:51:05,320
No, you have to see that.

9419
04:51:05,420 --> 04:51:06,760
That was actually crazy.

9420
04:51:07,140 --> 04:51:09,980
I don't know how I fucking live there.

9421
04:51:10,180 --> 04:51:10,520
Wait a second.

9422
04:51:10,720 --> 04:51:11,300
Game reports.

9423
04:51:11,560 --> 04:51:11,880
All right chat.

9424
04:51:11,980 --> 04:51:12,840
I'll show it to you guys.

9425
04:51:13,980 --> 04:51:16,060
You were like my actual hero there.

9426
04:51:18,120 --> 04:51:19,640
I was like...

9427
04:51:19,640 --> 04:51:20,820
I thought I was...

9428
04:51:20,820 --> 04:51:22,540
I'm gonna play your stream on my screen.

9429
04:51:22,820 --> 04:51:23,220
Okay.

9430
04:51:23,380 --> 04:51:23,620
Okay.

9431
04:51:23,760 --> 04:51:24,280
I'll show you.

9432
04:51:24,400 --> 04:51:24,500
Okay.

9433
04:51:24,620 --> 04:51:25,480
Where is this?

9434
04:51:25,960 --> 04:51:26,720
I'll show it.

9435
04:51:29,380 --> 04:51:29,780
Okay.

9436
04:51:30,260 --> 04:51:31,620
Let me know when...

9437
04:51:31,620 --> 04:51:32,880
Let me know when you're here.

9438
04:51:35,100 --> 04:51:36,500
Well then I gotta...

9439
04:51:36,500 --> 04:51:38,620
Then I gotta put something on really quick.

9440
04:51:42,640 --> 04:51:43,600
My hero.

9441
04:51:47,530 --> 04:51:48,690
I was like...

9442
04:51:48,690 --> 04:51:51,930
If I'm going to die, I'll bring someone down with me.

9443
04:51:57,550 --> 04:51:58,110
Yeah.

9444
04:51:58,490 --> 04:51:59,110
Let me know...

9445
04:52:00,010 --> 04:52:01,110
When I can play.

9446
04:52:01,310 --> 04:52:01,710
All right.

9447
04:52:01,930 --> 04:52:02,550
I'm in.

9448
04:52:02,550 --> 04:52:03,210
Okay.

9449
04:52:03,230 --> 04:52:03,770
Watch this.

9450
04:52:03,970 --> 04:52:04,070
Okay.

9451
04:52:04,190 --> 04:52:04,690
You see...

9452
04:52:04,690 --> 04:52:06,470
We see the ride.

9453
04:52:06,770 --> 04:52:07,790
And I was like...

9454
04:52:07,790 --> 04:52:08,290
Oh, fuck.

9455
04:52:11,190 --> 04:52:12,330
There's the mercy.

9456
04:52:21,050 --> 04:52:23,470
I was like...

9457
04:52:23,470 --> 04:52:25,090
If I'm gonna die...

9458
04:52:25,090 --> 04:52:27,890
I am gonna bring her down with me.

9459
04:52:28,350 --> 04:52:30,130
I have to drive by.

9460
04:52:32,770 --> 04:52:33,950
You fucked that man.

9461
04:52:34,110 --> 04:52:34,410
You fucked that man.

9462
04:52:34,410 --> 04:52:34,570
You got him.

9463
04:52:35,010 --> 04:52:35,290
Yeah.

9464
04:52:35,470 --> 04:52:36,570
That's what you get, Ryan.

9465
04:52:36,810 --> 04:52:38,630
You led me straight to your mercy.

9466
04:52:41,790 --> 04:52:42,610
That's fun.

9467
04:52:42,770 --> 04:52:43,190
Easy.

9468
04:52:43,590 --> 04:52:44,230
Easy clap.

9469
04:52:44,610 --> 04:52:45,090
Easy clap.

9470
04:52:45,250 --> 04:52:50,230
I probably would never have tried that game mode on my own, but I'm glad you introduced me to it.

9471
04:52:50,230 --> 04:52:52,130
Because at first, I was like...

9472
04:52:52,130 --> 04:52:53,590
My brain was being overloaded.

9473
04:52:53,770 --> 04:52:53,870
Yeah.

9474
04:52:54,190 --> 04:52:55,470
With too much stuff happening.

9475
04:52:55,790 --> 04:52:57,230
Since I haven't played Overwatch in a long time.

9476
04:52:57,330 --> 04:52:57,510
Yeah.

9477
04:52:57,750 --> 04:52:57,850
Yeah.

9478
04:52:58,090 --> 04:52:58,930
But it was fun.

9479
04:52:59,030 --> 04:52:59,110
Yeah.

9480
04:52:59,350 --> 04:52:59,510
Yeah.

9481
04:52:59,550 --> 04:53:05,390
I think the more you understand, the more fun it is when you're doing these insane builds that you can play around with.

9482
04:53:05,390 --> 04:53:08,330
Because you're like, oh, I should do this now, and I should sell that.

9483
04:53:08,930 --> 04:53:11,050
That's the best part about the stadium.

9484
04:53:11,290 --> 04:53:12,650
Because you're always trying...

9485
04:53:12,650 --> 04:53:16,010
Instead of counterpicking, you're just redoing your build and stuff.

9486
04:53:16,190 --> 04:53:18,970
So it's like Paladin slash Deadlock.

9487
04:53:19,590 --> 04:53:21,250
I wonder if Deadlock is still alive.

9488
04:53:23,530 --> 04:53:24,470
I feel like...

9489
04:53:25,370 --> 04:53:26,570
I think, yeah, it is.

9490
04:53:26,710 --> 04:53:27,150
Is it?

9491
04:53:27,170 --> 04:53:29,990
I know some people that still play actively, yeah.

9492
04:53:30,170 --> 04:53:34,750
I feel like ever since Marvel Rivals released, Deadlock felt kind of dead.

9493
04:53:37,690 --> 04:53:38,450
That's true.

9494
04:53:38,810 --> 04:53:43,250
Because Marvel Rivals came out not too long after Deadlock started getting popular.

9495
04:53:43,650 --> 04:53:44,550
Yeah, it started getting traction.

9496
04:53:44,790 --> 04:53:48,370
And then everybody just went straight to Marvel Rivals after that.

9497
04:53:48,850 --> 04:53:50,130
To be fair, it's still in beta.

9498
04:53:50,590 --> 04:53:52,570
So I feel like...

9499
04:53:52,570 --> 04:53:53,990
And it's Valve, you know?

9500
04:53:54,070 --> 04:53:55,590
Valve won't let that game die.

9501
04:53:56,390 --> 04:53:59,950
It's like their first game in how many years?

9502
04:54:00,170 --> 04:54:02,770
Like 10 plus years since they made a fucking game.

9503
04:54:05,170 --> 04:54:07,130
They have that good old Steam money.

9504
04:54:07,130 --> 04:54:11,310
And also, I think the competitive for it is still not actually out.

9505
04:54:11,530 --> 04:54:14,590
So they have a false competitive type of thing going on right now.

9506
04:54:14,590 --> 04:54:15,950
They don't have an official thing.

9507
04:54:16,130 --> 04:54:16,730
It's their...

9508
04:54:16,730 --> 04:54:17,070
Yeah.

9509
04:54:17,310 --> 04:54:19,210
And I feel like, you know, they have Steam money.

9510
04:54:19,210 --> 04:54:24,950
So, like, they're just going to pump so much money into it until it lives.

9511
04:54:25,370 --> 04:54:30,130
I have all the CS cases, all the money from that.

9512
04:54:30,130 --> 04:54:31,090
Yeah, yeah, it's true.

9513
04:54:31,470 --> 04:54:33,290
All the CS cases and stuff.

9514
04:54:33,610 --> 04:54:35,110
Wait, Artifact is from Valve?

9515
04:54:35,810 --> 04:54:37,230
I didn't know that.

9516
04:54:38,070 --> 04:54:38,710
I'd like...

9517
04:54:38,710 --> 04:54:41,270
To be fair, I forgot Artifact existed, to be fair.

9518
04:54:41,290 --> 04:54:42,130
Wait, what's from Valve?

9519
04:54:42,810 --> 04:54:43,210
Artifact?

9520
04:54:44,250 --> 04:54:47,190
Yeah, no, that's a good...

9521
04:54:47,190 --> 04:54:47,770
That's a...

9522
04:54:47,770 --> 04:54:48,090
I don't even know.

9523
04:54:48,990 --> 04:54:51,850
I see Evolve, because they also made Evolve.

9524
04:54:52,230 --> 04:54:53,290
Evolve was fun.

9525
04:54:53,290 --> 04:54:53,910
That one died pretty quickly.

9526
04:54:54,490 --> 04:54:55,990
I think Evolve was fun, though.

9527
04:54:56,330 --> 04:54:56,790
It's just like...

9528
04:54:56,790 --> 04:54:57,410
Yeah, it was cool.

9529
04:54:58,050 --> 04:54:58,530
I just...

9530
04:54:58,530 --> 04:54:59,010
It was just...

9531
04:54:59,010 --> 04:55:00,350
I think there was just not enough content.

9532
04:55:00,650 --> 04:55:03,490
But it felt like once you played it a few times, you've already experienced it.

9533
04:55:03,710 --> 04:55:06,010
Yeah, there was just not enough content for Evolve.

9534
04:55:06,510 --> 04:55:07,950
And then, after they realized that, they just...

9535
04:55:07,950 --> 04:55:09,570
Oh, they should have done a collab with like, Godzilla.

9536
04:55:09,570 --> 04:55:10,150
Yeah.

9537
04:55:11,250 --> 04:55:13,210
It's all... They should have collab skins like Fortnite.

9538
04:55:15,710 --> 04:55:16,070
Yeah.

9539
04:55:17,070 --> 04:55:18,030
Yeah, yeah.

9540
04:55:19,890 --> 04:55:21,110
Oh, Evolve is 2K?

9541
04:55:22,810 --> 04:55:23,810
Oh, okay.

9542
04:55:24,030 --> 04:55:25,390
So, chat, we got one guy.

9543
04:55:25,510 --> 04:55:25,810
Oh, really?

9544
04:55:25,930 --> 04:55:27,830
I thought... Why did I think it was...

9545
04:55:29,770 --> 04:55:32,330
Yeah, I definitely... I read that from chat and...

9546
04:55:32,330 --> 04:55:33,350
Yeah, we got one guy.

9547
04:55:33,690 --> 04:55:34,170
I didn't misremember it all.

9548
04:55:34,290 --> 04:55:35,170
That was chat's fault.

9549
04:55:35,170 --> 04:55:37,050
Yeah, this is chat's fault, not our fault.

9550
04:55:37,290 --> 04:55:38,490
We don't think for ourselves.

9551
04:55:38,490 --> 04:55:39,410
That's why we're streaming.

9552
04:55:39,950 --> 04:55:41,410
We just do it at chat.

9553
04:55:41,930 --> 04:55:42,350
Is this real?

9554
04:55:46,270 --> 04:55:46,670
True.

9555
04:55:47,150 --> 04:55:50,270
Yeah, when I turn off the stream, I don't even have any thoughts in my head.

9556
04:55:50,490 --> 04:55:50,690
It's true.

9557
04:55:50,950 --> 04:55:51,770
Because chat's not going.

9558
04:55:52,090 --> 04:55:52,570
I know.

9559
04:55:52,730 --> 04:55:58,030
I'm like, how am I supposed to think for myself if I'm not fed my information?

9560
04:56:01,510 --> 04:56:04,970
I do, like, if there's an important decision...

9561
04:56:04,970 --> 04:56:09,390
Well, kind of an important decision, I'm always like, fuck, I wish I could ask the chat right now.

9562
04:56:09,390 --> 04:56:09,910
It's so true.

9563
04:56:09,930 --> 04:56:11,990
I wish I could ask them, like, what they think I should do.

9564
04:56:12,250 --> 04:56:14,810
Yeah, like, you know, you're like, oh, which one looks better?

9565
04:56:15,030 --> 04:56:15,890
And then you don't have...

9566
04:56:15,890 --> 04:56:17,430
I know, we like to keep things a surprise.

9567
04:56:17,950 --> 04:56:18,430
Yeah, that's true.

9568
04:56:18,610 --> 04:56:18,870
That's true.

9569
04:56:19,090 --> 04:56:19,450
Yeah.

9570
04:56:19,450 --> 04:56:19,630
Yeah.

9571
04:56:20,570 --> 04:56:21,370
But GG's.

9572
04:56:21,410 --> 04:56:21,970
That was fun.

9573
04:56:22,150 --> 04:56:23,410
I learned so much in CS.

9574
04:56:23,690 --> 04:56:25,450
I actually found CS quite fun.

9575
04:56:25,790 --> 04:56:26,190
GG's.

9576
04:56:26,190 --> 04:56:26,190
Yeah.

9577
04:56:27,010 --> 04:56:29,910
I think, like, especially the fact that we didn't get any hackers.

9578
04:56:29,910 --> 04:56:30,550
Yeah, we should play again.

9579
04:56:30,730 --> 04:56:31,790
Oh, I would love to.

9580
04:56:32,090 --> 04:56:32,270
Yeah.

9581
04:56:32,530 --> 04:56:35,450
If you ever want another person to play CS...

9582
04:56:36,390 --> 04:56:38,550
I'm glad we didn't bump into any hackers.

9583
04:56:38,790 --> 04:56:41,930
That was... I think, like, the very first time I played CS GO...

9584
04:56:42,530 --> 04:56:43,960
Two times I played CS GO...

9585
04:56:45,130 --> 04:56:46,130
I had a hacker.

9586
04:56:47,690 --> 04:56:48,110
Twice.

9587
04:56:48,410 --> 04:56:49,250
Twice in a row.

9588
04:56:49,390 --> 04:56:51,190
And then every time I got a hacker...

9589
04:56:51,190 --> 04:56:51,770
The obvious one, yeah.

9590
04:56:51,870 --> 04:56:52,010
Yeah.

9591
04:56:52,210 --> 04:56:54,290
The one were the ones that, like, wallhack and everything.

9592
04:56:54,630 --> 04:56:56,070
And they were also from Europe.

9593
04:56:56,590 --> 04:56:57,010
So...

9594
04:56:57,010 --> 04:56:59,610
They were also from Europe.

9595
04:57:00,550 --> 04:57:01,950
And was, like...

9596
04:57:02,410 --> 04:57:03,510
Swearing at me in Europe.

9597
04:57:03,510 --> 04:57:05,590
Like, I think they were swearing at me in Russian.

9598
04:57:06,330 --> 04:57:06,690
Oh.

9599
04:57:08,050 --> 04:57:08,490
Oh.

9600
04:57:09,810 --> 04:57:10,250
Classic...

9601
04:57:10,250 --> 04:57:11,950
Counter-Strike experience.

9602
04:57:12,290 --> 04:57:12,430
Yeah.

9603
04:57:12,630 --> 04:57:13,030
And then...

9604
04:57:13,030 --> 04:57:13,770
And then I...

9605
04:57:13,770 --> 04:57:16,770
That's why I didn't touch CS GO for a long, long time.

9606
04:57:16,970 --> 04:57:18,670
And I tried to touch it again.

9607
04:57:19,070 --> 04:57:20,890
And then I also got into another hacker.

9608
04:57:21,170 --> 04:57:22,570
And then I was like, you know what?

9609
04:57:22,850 --> 04:57:25,570
Maybe CS is just not for me.

9610
04:57:26,230 --> 04:57:26,670
But...

9611
04:57:26,670 --> 04:57:27,670
I saw...

9612
04:57:27,670 --> 04:57:28,570
I had a lot of fun, though.

9613
04:57:28,850 --> 04:57:30,550
You do have to get Prime, I think.

9614
04:57:30,950 --> 04:57:31,150
Yeah.

9615
04:57:31,990 --> 04:57:32,290
Yeah!

9616
04:57:33,250 --> 04:57:34,870
Oh, we had to do this again.

9617
04:57:35,490 --> 04:57:37,170
And, like, you can teach me more CS.

9618
04:57:37,430 --> 04:57:37,830
And then...

9619
04:57:37,830 --> 04:57:40,730
And then you'll have more CS buddies to play with.

9620
04:57:43,230 --> 04:57:43,710
Yay!

9621
04:57:44,330 --> 04:57:46,150
Yeah, you gotta learn all the other maps.

9622
04:57:46,410 --> 04:57:46,730
No!

9623
04:57:47,430 --> 04:57:48,290
There's more maps to learn.

9624
04:57:48,450 --> 04:57:49,290
You don't call out.

9625
04:57:49,730 --> 04:57:50,070
Yeah!

9626
04:57:50,390 --> 04:57:53,270
Why learn more maps when I can just do Dust2?

9627
04:57:55,430 --> 04:57:57,550
Isn't Dust2 the most important map?

9628
04:57:57,550 --> 04:57:57,830
No!

9629
04:57:57,950 --> 04:57:58,630
You'll get bored.

9630
04:57:58,730 --> 04:57:59,430
You'll get bored.

9631
04:57:59,430 --> 04:58:00,050
Oh!

9632
04:58:00,730 --> 04:58:03,570
How can I get bored when it's Dust2?

9633
04:58:04,790 --> 04:58:05,090
Yeah!

9634
04:58:07,930 --> 04:58:08,870
Dust2 forever!

9635
04:58:09,710 --> 04:58:10,070
I'm...

9636
04:58:10,070 --> 04:58:11,470
I'm sick of Dust2!

9637
04:58:12,250 --> 04:58:14,730
How can you be sick of Dust2?

9638
04:58:16,030 --> 04:58:17,810
It's the CS map!

9639
04:58:18,030 --> 04:58:21,250
Well, once you play on it, like, three or four times...

9640
04:58:21,250 --> 04:58:22,050
It's...

9641
04:58:22,050 --> 04:58:22,890
No, it's...

9642
04:58:22,890 --> 04:58:24,210
You get tired of it.

9643
04:58:24,450 --> 04:58:26,350
What are your favorite maps, then?

9644
04:58:31,090 --> 04:58:31,530
Um...

9645
04:58:32,250 --> 04:58:36,350
I kind of like Duke right now, and I don't mind Mirage, and...

9646
04:58:36,990 --> 04:58:41,370
There's just one that everybody really likes, but it's coming back soon, because they recently purchased it.

9647
04:58:41,510 --> 04:58:43,050
Um, from, like, the original creators.

9648
04:58:43,170 --> 04:58:43,890
It's called Cache.

9649
04:58:44,410 --> 04:58:44,850
Cache?

9650
04:58:45,190 --> 04:58:45,450
Cache?

9651
04:58:45,950 --> 04:58:47,370
Wait, what's the Cache map?

9652
04:58:47,650 --> 04:58:47,790
Sounds good.

9653
04:58:48,170 --> 04:58:48,470
Yeah.

9654
04:58:48,890 --> 04:58:49,930
What does that one look like?

9655
04:58:49,930 --> 04:58:50,150
Yeah.

9656
04:58:51,930 --> 04:58:52,410
Um...

9657
04:58:52,930 --> 04:58:56,190
It's, like, gray, and it's got some moss and stuff, and...

9658
04:58:56,190 --> 04:58:57,990
It's got a checker floor room.

9659
04:58:58,030 --> 04:58:58,330
What?

9660
04:58:58,330 --> 04:58:59,930
It's got, like, all these things that are cool.

9661
04:59:00,290 --> 04:59:00,770
Holy shit!

9662
04:59:00,770 --> 04:59:03,130
I don't even think I remember what Cache looks like.

9663
04:59:03,250 --> 04:59:03,370
Yeah.

9664
04:59:03,630 --> 04:59:05,950
The only one I remember was the one with the...

9665
04:59:05,950 --> 04:59:08,510
With the little, like, sewer area...

9666
04:59:08,510 --> 04:59:09,690
At the bottom.

9667
04:59:10,770 --> 04:59:11,470
And then...

9668
04:59:11,470 --> 04:59:12,310
Oh, oh, oh, overpass.

9669
04:59:12,550 --> 04:59:13,790
Yeah, I know that map.

9670
04:59:14,130 --> 04:59:14,530
I know...

9671
04:59:14,530 --> 04:59:16,090
Everybody knows Dust2.

9672
04:59:16,710 --> 04:59:17,950
And then...

9673
04:59:17,950 --> 04:59:18,730
Um...

9674
04:59:19,770 --> 04:59:20,610
And then...

9675
04:59:20,610 --> 04:59:21,830
And then the trains.

9676
04:59:23,850 --> 04:59:24,770
The mini trains.

9677
04:59:25,190 --> 04:59:25,450
Oh, train map?

9678
04:59:25,630 --> 04:59:26,570
Yeah, the train map.

9679
04:59:26,690 --> 04:59:28,970
That's the only three maps that I remember.

9680
04:59:29,370 --> 04:59:30,050
And then...

9681
04:59:30,050 --> 04:59:30,650
And then...

9682
04:59:30,650 --> 04:59:31,790
I know, like, surfing.

9683
04:59:34,050 --> 04:59:34,490
Oh!

9684
04:59:34,890 --> 04:59:37,110
I tried surfing the other day, like, yesterday.

9685
04:59:37,370 --> 04:59:37,390
Yeah?

9686
04:59:37,390 --> 04:59:38,990
And I was like, I can't fucking do this.

9687
04:59:39,110 --> 04:59:40,030
I'm stuck at it.

9688
04:59:40,150 --> 04:59:40,550
I suck.

9689
04:59:41,410 --> 04:59:42,450
I think, like...

9690
04:59:42,450 --> 04:59:43,150
I think, like...

9691
04:59:43,150 --> 04:59:46,030
I'd done surfing, like, once, and I was like...

9692
04:59:46,030 --> 04:59:47,310
I was just like, alright.

9693
04:59:48,110 --> 04:59:48,970
I'm good.

9694
04:59:49,470 --> 04:59:50,410
I am not.

9695
04:59:50,670 --> 04:59:51,470
I'm good.

9696
04:59:51,870 --> 04:59:52,970
I don't think I can...

9697
04:59:52,970 --> 04:59:53,050
Yeah.

9698
04:59:53,170 --> 04:59:54,290
Do these sick-ass...

9699
04:59:54,290 --> 04:59:57,770
You know, like, those, like, surf montages they do in the past.

9700
04:59:57,950 --> 04:59:58,390
Like...

9701
04:59:58,390 --> 04:59:58,430
Oh.

9702
04:59:58,510 --> 05:00:00,440
In the YouTube drama videos.

9703
05:00:01,310 --> 05:00:01,850
Where it's like...

9704
05:00:01,850 --> 05:00:02,110
Yeah.

9705
05:00:02,470 --> 05:00:03,090
Drama alert!

9706
05:00:03,330 --> 05:00:06,170
And then it's just commentary over CSGO surf.

9707
05:00:07,150 --> 05:00:07,610
Yeah.

9708
05:00:08,590 --> 05:00:09,010
Yeah.

9709
05:00:09,010 --> 05:00:09,730
No, nowadays...

9710
05:00:09,730 --> 05:00:11,530
Nowadays, there's Minecraft parkour.

9711
05:00:11,650 --> 05:00:12,230
That's true!

9712
05:00:12,510 --> 05:00:14,240
Yeah, now there's Minecraft parkour.

9713
05:00:15,030 --> 05:00:15,630
It's been replaced.

9714
05:00:15,890 --> 05:00:16,770
Yeah, it's so true.

9715
05:00:17,150 --> 05:00:17,770
Oh my...

9716
05:00:17,770 --> 05:00:20,390
Minecraft parkour is, like, brainwashing for me.

9717
05:00:20,470 --> 05:00:22,350
I can sit there and watch it for hours.

9718
05:00:22,350 --> 05:00:23,090
That's so true.

9719
05:00:23,110 --> 05:00:23,190
Yeah.

9720
05:00:23,510 --> 05:00:24,510
Have you tried the...

9721
05:00:24,510 --> 05:00:25,670
There's, like, the...

9722
05:00:25,670 --> 05:00:26,350
You know, like, the...

9723
05:00:26,350 --> 05:00:27,490
The beef and chicken?

9724
05:00:27,490 --> 05:00:30,470
They actually made a real Minecraft server for that.

9725
05:00:31,530 --> 05:00:32,010
Oh.

9726
05:00:33,210 --> 05:00:33,690
I...

9727
05:00:33,690 --> 05:00:34,390
I gave up.

9728
05:00:34,690 --> 05:00:36,810
Honestly, I don't even know what that really is.

9729
05:00:36,970 --> 05:00:37,590
Beef or chicken?

9730
05:00:38,070 --> 05:00:39,050
You don't know when you...

9731
05:00:39,050 --> 05:00:40,430
When you jump for the...

9732
05:00:40,930 --> 05:00:41,410
Okay.

9733
05:00:41,670 --> 05:00:43,810
I kind of get the idea of it, yeah.

9734
05:00:44,210 --> 05:00:44,650
I would say...

9735
05:00:44,650 --> 05:00:45,590
Oh, parkour civilization.

9736
05:00:45,950 --> 05:00:47,430
Okay, so it's basically...

9737
05:00:47,430 --> 05:00:49,350
Okay, it's like a fucking...

9738
05:00:49,350 --> 05:00:51,850
I only watched, like, ten minutes of that video.

9739
05:00:52,170 --> 05:00:55,130
Because it's apparently, like, a eight-hour series.

9740
05:00:55,430 --> 05:00:57,210
Like, the whole series is, like...

9741
05:00:57,210 --> 05:00:57,490
Yeah.

9742
05:00:57,790 --> 05:00:58,630
Eight plus hours.

9743
05:00:58,970 --> 05:00:59,850
And then...

9744
05:00:59,850 --> 05:01:00,430
And then...

9745
05:01:00,430 --> 05:01:03,310
But you get all the information you need in ten minutes.

9746
05:01:03,350 --> 05:01:05,730
Because it's, like, will you jump for the chicken or beef?

9747
05:01:06,050 --> 05:01:06,230
Oh.

9748
05:01:06,770 --> 05:01:08,650
And then after that, it's, like...

9749
05:01:08,650 --> 05:01:09,490
It's, like...

9750
05:01:09,490 --> 05:01:10,530
It's only, like, four hours.

9751
05:01:10,650 --> 05:01:14,310
Yes, but, like, four hours in the internet is, like, eight hours in real life to me.

9752
05:01:15,370 --> 05:01:15,850
Um...

9753
05:01:15,850 --> 05:01:16,150
Yeah.

9754
05:01:18,070 --> 05:01:19,190
I need a...

9755
05:01:19,190 --> 05:01:24,850
I gotta ask, like, ChatGPT to summarize, like, newer memes or something.

9756
05:01:25,170 --> 05:01:25,230
Yeah.

9757
05:01:25,570 --> 05:01:28,530
At Chat, what is the Rizzler?

9758
05:01:28,530 --> 05:01:29,090
Oh.

9759
05:01:30,730 --> 05:01:31,090
Oh.

9760
05:01:34,190 --> 05:01:34,550
Oh.

9761
05:01:34,590 --> 05:01:34,850
Oh, yeah.

9762
05:01:35,270 --> 05:01:35,630
GGs.

9763
05:01:36,110 --> 05:01:36,390
Doobie.

9764
05:01:36,390 --> 05:01:37,270
Okay, I know that one at least.

9765
05:01:37,650 --> 05:01:37,870
Yeah.

9766
05:01:38,410 --> 05:01:39,010
I was gonna say.

9767
05:01:39,290 --> 05:01:39,610
Oh, my.

9768
05:01:39,770 --> 05:01:40,130
It's been...

9769
05:01:40,130 --> 05:01:40,750
It's been five hours.

9770
05:01:41,030 --> 05:01:41,090
Yeah.

9771
05:01:41,810 --> 05:01:41,930
Yeah.

9772
05:01:42,170 --> 05:01:42,530
GGs.

9773
05:01:42,750 --> 05:01:43,090
Doobie.

9774
05:01:43,270 --> 05:01:44,530
I had a great time.

9775
05:01:45,230 --> 05:01:46,110
I hope you and...

9776
05:01:46,450 --> 05:01:48,510
I hope you and the minions...

9777
05:01:48,510 --> 05:01:48,930
Me too.

9778
05:01:49,050 --> 05:01:49,850
Have a...

9779
05:01:49,850 --> 05:01:51,190
The good rest of your stream.

9780
05:01:55,360 --> 05:01:56,080
Thank you.

9781
05:01:56,300 --> 05:01:56,580
Yeah.

9782
05:01:57,120 --> 05:01:58,700
Were you, like, lagging in real life?

9783
05:01:58,720 --> 05:01:59,380
That's what we're gonna go by.

9784
05:02:00,840 --> 05:02:02,780
I was like, Doobie, are you okay?

9785
05:02:02,940 --> 05:02:03,020
Yeah.

9786
05:02:03,020 --> 05:02:03,900
Are you, like, lagging?

9787
05:02:03,900 --> 05:02:06,080
I think there's, like, a delay right now between...

9788
05:02:06,100 --> 05:02:06,920
No, there's...

9789
05:02:06,920 --> 05:02:09,720
There's a delay between our voice chats.

9790
05:02:09,760 --> 05:02:10,520
I think.

9791
05:02:10,660 --> 05:02:11,240
For some reason.

9792
05:02:11,500 --> 05:02:12,100
Wait, really?

9793
05:02:12,300 --> 05:02:13,440
There's no delay for me.

9794
05:02:13,560 --> 05:02:13,800
Right?

9795
05:02:13,940 --> 05:02:15,160
Chat, you guys noticed it.

9796
05:02:15,420 --> 05:02:16,240
What is there?

9797
05:02:16,500 --> 05:02:16,720
No.

9798
05:02:17,040 --> 05:02:18,280
Maybe it's on my side.

9799
05:02:18,280 --> 05:02:18,800
I don't know.

9800
05:02:18,980 --> 05:02:19,880
Yeah, I was gonna say.

9801
05:02:20,040 --> 05:02:21,300
There is no delay for me.

9802
05:02:21,300 --> 05:02:22,440
Okay, when I say...

9803
05:02:22,440 --> 05:02:23,360
When I say...

9804
05:02:24,420 --> 05:02:24,900
Banana...

9805
05:02:24,900 --> 05:02:25,000
Banana.

9806
05:02:25,000 --> 05:02:25,520
You say Doki.

9807
05:02:25,660 --> 05:02:25,840
Banana.

9808
05:02:25,860 --> 05:02:26,080
Doki.

9809
05:02:28,740 --> 05:02:29,220
No.

9810
05:02:29,800 --> 05:02:30,460
Okay, okay.

9811
05:02:30,640 --> 05:02:31,420
Say it one more time.

9812
05:02:31,600 --> 05:02:31,960
Banana.

9813
05:02:32,420 --> 05:02:32,720
Doki.

9814
05:02:35,280 --> 05:02:35,760
What?

9815
05:02:35,940 --> 05:02:37,220
How long is this delay?

9816
05:02:37,520 --> 05:02:37,600
Banana.

9817
05:02:37,900 --> 05:02:38,280
Doki.

9818
05:02:40,540 --> 05:02:41,020
Banana.

9819
05:02:41,440 --> 05:02:41,760
Doki.

9820
05:02:41,940 --> 05:02:42,440
What the fuck?

9821
05:02:42,640 --> 05:02:42,900
Okay.

9822
05:02:43,340 --> 05:02:44,580
Maybe we should just say bot.

9823
05:02:44,780 --> 05:02:45,280
Oh my god.

9824
05:02:45,900 --> 05:02:46,960
It's really bad.

9825
05:02:47,480 --> 05:02:48,580
How does it...

9826
05:02:48,580 --> 05:02:49,660
Oh my god.

9827
05:02:49,760 --> 05:02:50,580
How does it...

9828
05:02:50,580 --> 05:02:51,180
Like...

9829
05:02:51,180 --> 05:02:53,580
How is it lagging on your side?

9830
05:02:54,000 --> 05:02:54,940
I'm getting the...

9831
05:02:54,940 --> 05:02:55,400
I don't know.

9832
05:02:56,160 --> 05:02:56,740
There's...

9833
05:02:56,740 --> 05:02:57,620
No way.

9834
05:02:58,080 --> 05:02:58,500
Wait.

9835
05:02:58,660 --> 05:03:00,620
Is it on her stream lagging as well?

9836
05:03:01,360 --> 05:03:01,940
Or...

9837
05:03:01,940 --> 05:03:03,620
Or it's just like...

9838
05:03:03,620 --> 05:03:03,860
Her.

9839
05:03:04,180 --> 05:03:05,360
It's just Doki.

9840
05:03:07,900 --> 05:03:08,600
I have no idea.

9841
05:03:09,740 --> 05:03:10,160
Banana.

9842
05:03:12,060 --> 05:03:12,640
Doki.

9843
05:03:13,160 --> 05:03:13,840
Oh my god.

9844
05:03:14,080 --> 05:03:14,340
Wait.

9845
05:03:14,660 --> 05:03:15,020
Okay.

9846
05:03:15,120 --> 05:03:15,760
Oh my god.

9847
05:03:15,960 --> 05:03:16,540
No, okay.

9848
05:03:16,780 --> 05:03:17,420
I like...

9849
05:03:17,420 --> 05:03:18,200
No, okay.

9850
05:03:19,360 --> 05:03:20,240
There's some...

9851
05:03:20,240 --> 05:03:20,300
There's some...

9852
05:03:20,300 --> 05:03:21,200
I think it's Discord.

9853
05:03:21,800 --> 05:03:22,160
I...

9854
05:03:22,160 --> 05:03:23,280
Tab to Discord.

9855
05:03:23,480 --> 05:03:27,260
And then the MS was at 300 MS.

9856
05:03:29,100 --> 05:03:29,620
Oh.

9857
05:03:30,240 --> 05:03:30,760
Yeah.

9858
05:03:30,920 --> 05:03:33,220
You were like cutting in and out for me for some reason.

9859
05:03:33,500 --> 05:03:34,180
Oh my...

9860
05:03:34,180 --> 05:03:34,320
Wait.

9861
05:03:34,400 --> 05:03:35,700
Was I cutting in and out?

9862
05:03:36,040 --> 05:03:36,120
Sometimes.

9863
05:03:36,640 --> 05:03:37,620
The whole entire time?

9864
05:03:38,980 --> 05:03:40,300
Or like just recently?

9865
05:03:43,120 --> 05:03:43,560
No.

9866
05:03:44,100 --> 05:03:44,820
Just sometimes.

9867
05:03:45,140 --> 05:03:46,520
Just like maybe...

9868
05:03:47,280 --> 05:03:48,540
I changed the server.

9869
05:03:50,360 --> 05:03:51,120
Just what?

9870
05:03:51,280 --> 05:03:51,940
Maybe that fixed it.

9871
05:03:52,520 --> 05:03:52,860
Just...

9872
05:03:52,860 --> 05:03:53,400
No, don't...

9873
05:03:53,400 --> 05:03:54,200
Don't worry about it.

9874
05:03:55,960 --> 05:03:57,900
I think you're really out of sync, so...

9875
05:03:57,900 --> 05:03:58,620
Oh my...

9876
05:03:58,620 --> 05:04:00,320
Yeah, but on my end it was fine.

9877
05:04:00,540 --> 05:04:00,800
It was...

9878
05:04:00,800 --> 05:04:01,280
That's weird.

9879
05:04:02,000 --> 05:04:02,440
Oh.

9880
05:04:02,640 --> 05:04:03,220
That is weird.

9881
05:04:03,380 --> 05:04:03,620
Yeah.

9882
05:04:03,620 --> 05:04:04,580
Yeah.

9883
05:04:04,720 --> 05:04:07,080
The chat was saying that you were cutting in and out.

9884
05:04:07,360 --> 05:04:08,220
But like...

9885
05:04:08,220 --> 05:04:08,740
I...

9886
05:04:08,740 --> 05:04:10,720
It wasn't like super noticeable for me.

9887
05:04:11,280 --> 05:04:11,500
Yeah.

9888
05:04:11,500 --> 05:04:11,860
Same.

9889
05:04:12,140 --> 05:04:12,320
Yeah.

9890
05:04:12,900 --> 05:04:13,800
That's so weird.

9891
05:04:14,200 --> 05:04:17,300
I mean Discord has been like really fucking weird lately.

9892
05:04:17,720 --> 05:04:18,420
Same with Twitch.

9893
05:04:19,160 --> 05:04:20,140
I think like people...

9894
05:04:20,140 --> 05:04:20,280
Yeah.

9895
05:04:20,420 --> 05:04:23,620
I think like internet security is just weird in general.

9896
05:04:25,000 --> 05:04:26,740
Well, I think more people...

9897
05:04:26,740 --> 05:04:28,480
They're trying to get more money for...

9898
05:04:28,480 --> 05:04:29,160
That's true.

9899
05:04:29,480 --> 05:04:30,560
Server costs.

9900
05:04:30,700 --> 05:04:30,820
Yeah.

9901
05:04:30,880 --> 05:04:33,260
Which is probably not what the money is going towards.

9902
05:04:33,260 --> 05:04:33,640
Yeah.

9903
05:04:34,380 --> 05:04:34,880
I heard that...

9904
05:04:34,880 --> 05:04:36,340
They're just finding ways to cut back.

9905
05:04:36,640 --> 05:04:36,780
Hmm.

9906
05:04:37,000 --> 05:04:38,140
I heard like when...

9907
05:04:38,140 --> 05:04:39,560
You know Discord got...

9908
05:04:39,560 --> 05:04:40,760
Like the CEO...

9909
05:04:40,760 --> 05:04:42,620
You heard like the CEO like...

9910
05:04:43,660 --> 05:04:44,100
Dropped...

9911
05:04:44,100 --> 05:04:44,600
Um...

9912
05:04:44,600 --> 05:04:45,160
Step down.

9913
05:04:45,460 --> 05:04:46,720
And then they hired a new CEO.

9914
05:04:47,040 --> 05:04:47,200
Yeah.

9915
05:04:47,540 --> 05:04:48,220
And then like...

9916
05:04:48,220 --> 05:04:49,200
The first thing they were...

9917
05:04:49,200 --> 05:04:50,440
They were planning on doing like...

9918
05:04:50,440 --> 05:04:52,540
They were trying to do like...

9919
05:04:52,540 --> 05:04:52,980
Um...

9920
05:04:52,980 --> 05:04:53,840
Ads or something.

9921
05:04:54,060 --> 05:04:54,740
Did you hear that?

9922
05:04:54,900 --> 05:04:57,440
I was like how the fuck do you put ads in Discord?

9923
05:04:57,920 --> 05:04:58,360
Like...

9924
05:04:58,360 --> 05:04:58,920
With like...

9925
05:04:58,920 --> 05:05:00,960
Before you get into this call...

9926
05:05:00,960 --> 05:05:02,160
Do you want to watch this video?

9927
05:05:03,880 --> 05:05:04,280
Oh...

9928
05:05:04,280 --> 05:05:05,520
I was thinking of it.

9929
05:05:05,600 --> 05:05:07,600
I'm so sick of the internet right now.

9930
05:05:07,620 --> 05:05:08,440
The way it is.

9931
05:05:08,640 --> 05:05:09,500
It's just like...

9932
05:05:09,500 --> 05:05:09,980
You need...

9933
05:05:09,980 --> 05:05:10,960
Like I want to watch...

9934
05:05:10,960 --> 05:05:11,500
I pay...

9935
05:05:11,500 --> 05:05:12,400
I have Amazon Prime.

9936
05:05:12,620 --> 05:05:12,700
Yeah.

9937
05:05:12,700 --> 05:05:13,940
So I want to watch like...

9938
05:05:13,940 --> 05:05:15,560
A Prime show or something.

9939
05:05:15,760 --> 05:05:16,220
And it's like...

9940
05:05:16,220 --> 05:05:18,600
You need to pay $2.99 to watch this without ads.

9941
05:05:18,720 --> 05:05:18,880
It's like...

9942
05:05:18,880 --> 05:05:19,520
What the fuck?

9943
05:05:19,960 --> 05:05:20,900
It was so annoying.

9944
05:05:21,040 --> 05:05:21,800
I think I was watching...

9945
05:05:21,800 --> 05:05:23,020
Invincible or something.

9946
05:05:23,260 --> 05:05:23,800
And then like...

9947
05:05:23,800 --> 05:05:24,060
Yes!

9948
05:05:24,060 --> 05:05:24,640
The moment...

9949
05:05:24,640 --> 05:05:25,300
The moment...

9950
05:05:25,300 --> 05:05:25,560
You know like...

9951
05:05:25,560 --> 05:05:26,640
The crucial moment...

9952
05:05:26,640 --> 05:05:27,340
It was like...

9953
05:05:27,340 --> 05:05:28,500
Here's like...

9954
05:05:28,500 --> 05:05:29,780
30 seconds of ads.

9955
05:05:30,020 --> 05:05:30,800
I'm like...

9956
05:05:31,620 --> 05:05:32,100
What?

9957
05:05:32,300 --> 05:05:32,560
Wait...

9958
05:05:32,560 --> 05:05:33,680
What am I paying for?

9959
05:05:34,020 --> 05:05:34,400
Like what?

9960
05:05:35,040 --> 05:05:36,360
Don't I pay for this already?

9961
05:05:36,360 --> 05:05:36,680
Yeah.

9962
05:05:36,680 --> 05:05:37,860
And then it's like...

9963
05:05:37,860 --> 05:05:39,360
No, you have to buy like...

9964
05:05:39,360 --> 05:05:41,920
The Amazon Prime Privilege Pack.

9965
05:05:42,860 --> 05:05:43,340
Yeah.

9966
05:05:43,600 --> 05:05:43,960
And then...

9967
05:05:43,960 --> 05:05:44,980
And then the same thing with Twitter.

9968
05:05:45,180 --> 05:05:45,580
It's like...

9969
05:05:45,580 --> 05:05:46,820
Oh, you don't want to see ads?

9970
05:05:46,820 --> 05:05:48,380
Even though you already pay for...

9971
05:05:48,380 --> 05:05:48,820
Twitter...

9972
05:05:48,820 --> 05:05:49,200
Yeah!

9973
05:05:50,200 --> 05:05:50,840
So dumb.

9974
05:05:51,100 --> 05:05:51,600
That's so dumb.

9975
05:05:51,760 --> 05:05:52,740
Yeah, they're just like...

9976
05:05:52,740 --> 05:05:53,440
Yeah, cause like...

9977
05:05:53,440 --> 05:05:55,280
Nobody watches TV anymore.

9978
05:05:55,420 --> 05:05:55,920
So they're like...

9979
05:05:55,920 --> 05:05:57,280
The ad companies are like...

9980
05:05:57,280 --> 05:05:58,380
We gotta put it somewhere.

9981
05:05:59,960 --> 05:06:00,440
Yeah.

9982
05:06:00,620 --> 05:06:01,400
I guess.

9983
05:06:02,100 --> 05:06:03,040
I had to...

9984
05:06:03,040 --> 05:06:05,700
I had to buy a YouTube...

9985
05:06:05,700 --> 05:06:06,340
What is it called?

9986
05:06:06,680 --> 05:06:07,080
The...

9987
05:06:07,800 --> 05:06:08,200
Um...

9988
05:06:08,200 --> 05:06:09,180
The YouTube equivalent.

9989
05:06:09,360 --> 05:06:10,460
The subscription base now.

9990
05:06:11,560 --> 05:06:11,960
Uh...

9991
05:06:11,960 --> 05:06:13,120
I don't remember what it was called.

9992
05:06:13,440 --> 05:06:13,700
But...

9993
05:06:13,700 --> 05:06:13,900
Oh, yeah.

9994
05:06:14,040 --> 05:06:14,260
Premium.

9995
05:06:14,520 --> 05:06:14,700
Premium.

9996
05:06:14,980 --> 05:06:15,040
Yeah.

9997
05:06:15,100 --> 05:06:16,380
I had to get the YouTube premium.

9998
05:06:16,820 --> 05:06:17,600
Because I was...

9999
05:06:17,600 --> 05:06:18,800
I was so tired of...

10000
05:06:18,800 --> 05:06:21,240
You know how they recently patched like...

10001
05:06:21,240 --> 05:06:21,740
Plugins?

10002
05:06:21,900 --> 05:06:22,300
Yeah.

10003
05:06:23,600 --> 05:06:24,280
Plugins, yeah.

10004
05:06:24,440 --> 05:06:24,640
Yeah.

10005
05:06:24,760 --> 05:06:25,800
The buy premium.

10006
05:06:26,080 --> 05:06:26,860
Cause I was like...

10007
05:06:26,860 --> 05:06:29,700
I just wanna watch my silly YouTube videos.

10008
05:06:29,860 --> 05:06:32,580
I don't even remember what YouTube video pushed me over the edge.

10009
05:06:32,880 --> 05:06:34,200
I told chat what it was.

10010
05:06:34,320 --> 05:06:35,160
And my chat was like...

10011
05:06:35,160 --> 05:06:36,240
I can't believe this...

10012
05:06:36,240 --> 05:06:37,260
This was the...

10013
05:06:37,260 --> 05:06:40,460
Video that caused you to buy YouTube premium.

10014
05:06:40,800 --> 05:06:41,340
But you know...

10015
05:06:41,340 --> 05:06:42,860
They're changing YouTube premium too.

10016
05:06:43,080 --> 05:06:44,120
Now you have to get like...

10017
05:06:44,120 --> 05:06:45,160
A smaller premium.

10018
05:06:45,380 --> 05:06:45,720
Yeah.

10019
05:06:45,840 --> 05:06:46,800
To avoid ads.

10020
05:06:46,800 --> 05:06:47,760
Oh, I remember.

10021
05:06:47,980 --> 05:06:48,000
Yeah.

10022
05:06:48,180 --> 05:06:49,360
I was watching Ink Master.

10023
05:06:49,880 --> 05:06:50,620
I was like...

10024
05:06:51,440 --> 05:06:53,160
I was watching Ink Master.

10025
05:06:53,160 --> 05:06:53,220
I was watching Ink Master.

10026
05:06:53,220 --> 05:06:53,900
And I was like...

10027
05:06:53,900 --> 05:06:55,260
I'm tired of these ads.

10028
05:06:55,260 --> 05:06:56,940
I'm trying to watch Ink Master.

10029
05:06:57,300 --> 05:06:59,800
I wanna know how they fuck up these tattoos.

10030
05:07:02,340 --> 05:07:05,540
At least it wasn't the beef or chicken like parkour so...

10031
05:07:05,540 --> 05:07:05,640
Oh, that's so true.

10032
05:07:05,640 --> 05:07:06,180
Like eight hours.

10033
05:07:06,640 --> 05:07:07,200
Yeah.

10034
05:07:08,020 --> 05:07:09,780
Thank God I wasn't that brain-rotted.

10035
05:07:11,240 --> 05:07:11,660
Yeah.

10036
05:07:12,540 --> 05:07:13,300
But yeah.

10037
05:07:13,780 --> 05:07:14,840
GG's Doobie.

10038
05:07:15,120 --> 05:07:15,700
GG's.

10039
05:07:15,780 --> 05:07:16,700
I hope...

10040
05:07:16,700 --> 05:07:17,820
You'll rest well.

10041
05:07:18,040 --> 05:07:19,620
I had a great time playing with you.

10042
05:07:20,100 --> 05:07:20,160
Me too.

10043
05:07:20,420 --> 05:07:21,280
Me too.

10044
05:07:21,280 --> 05:07:23,320
You can talk to my Drag Orange now.

10045
05:07:23,460 --> 05:07:25,060
And you can talk to your little minions.

10046
05:07:25,540 --> 05:07:26,240
Your little...

10047
05:07:26,240 --> 05:07:27,160
Double...

10048
05:07:27,160 --> 05:07:28,160
Mini D's.

10049
05:07:28,760 --> 05:07:29,160
Oh.

10050
05:07:29,660 --> 05:07:29,960
Cute.

10051
05:07:31,280 --> 05:07:32,400
Mini D's.

10052
05:07:32,500 --> 05:07:33,580
Your Dubert's.

10053
05:07:33,780 --> 05:07:34,760
Your Orphans.

10054
05:07:35,520 --> 05:07:36,520
Whatever they are.

10055
05:07:36,740 --> 05:07:37,340
Oh, okay.

10056
05:07:41,020 --> 05:07:41,580
Whatever.

10057
05:07:41,900 --> 05:07:42,540
The Dubes.

10058
05:07:42,620 --> 05:07:43,020
Oh my God.

10059
05:07:43,100 --> 05:07:43,600
That's cute.

10060
05:07:43,800 --> 05:07:44,460
The Dubes.

10061
05:07:44,580 --> 05:07:44,900
Yeah.

10062
05:07:45,140 --> 05:07:45,780
That is cute.

10063
05:07:45,980 --> 05:07:46,980
The Dublings.

10064
05:07:46,980 --> 05:07:47,740
Oh my God.

10065
05:07:47,840 --> 05:07:48,240
Dublings.

10066
05:07:49,160 --> 05:07:49,480
One day.

10067
05:07:49,500 --> 05:07:51,020
One day you'll be named.

10068
05:07:52,500 --> 05:07:53,460
Well, I...

10069
05:07:53,460 --> 05:07:54,600
It's in the works.

10070
05:07:54,880 --> 05:07:55,340
You'll see.

10071
05:07:55,400 --> 05:07:56,580
Oh, there's Orbeez.

10072
05:07:56,780 --> 05:07:57,060
Or...

10073
05:07:57,060 --> 05:07:57,800
Ordeez.

10074
05:07:58,400 --> 05:07:58,960
Ordeez?

10075
05:07:59,360 --> 05:07:59,920
Or...

10076
05:07:59,920 --> 05:08:00,960
Ordeez Nuts.

10077
05:08:01,140 --> 05:08:02,080
Ordeez Nuts.

10078
05:08:02,240 --> 05:08:02,400
Yeah.

10079
05:08:03,640 --> 05:08:05,040
Doobie and the Dubes.

10080
05:08:07,000 --> 05:08:07,560
But...

10081
05:08:07,560 --> 05:08:08,020
Alright.

10082
05:08:08,020 --> 05:08:08,680
Scooby Doobies.

10083
05:08:08,780 --> 05:08:09,500
Oh, I like that.

10084
05:08:09,620 --> 05:08:10,580
The Scooby Doobies.

10085
05:08:12,020 --> 05:08:13,840
But there's like a...

10086
05:08:13,840 --> 05:08:14,540
It's copyright.

10087
05:08:14,760 --> 05:08:15,980
Well, I guess it's fine.

10088
05:08:16,140 --> 05:08:16,520
Probably.

10089
05:08:16,980 --> 05:08:17,760
One day.

10090
05:08:18,260 --> 05:08:19,140
One day.

10091
05:08:19,500 --> 05:08:19,600
One day.

10092
05:08:19,600 --> 05:08:19,920
I'm...

10093
05:08:19,920 --> 05:08:21,700
I'm looking forward to...

10094
05:08:21,700 --> 05:08:22,820
To the naming ceremony.

10095
05:08:22,820 --> 05:08:24,180
Whenever that day is.

10096
05:08:26,180 --> 05:08:26,740
Yeah.

10097
05:08:26,920 --> 05:08:28,480
I'll hold a big celebration stream.

10098
05:08:28,940 --> 05:08:28,960
Yeah.

10099
05:08:28,960 --> 05:08:29,200
A big...

10100
05:08:29,200 --> 05:08:30,340
It's like a huge...

10101
05:08:30,340 --> 05:08:31,080
Big announcement.

10102
05:08:32,100 --> 05:08:32,660
Yeah.

10103
05:08:32,660 --> 05:08:33,560
We're gonna go to Chuck E.

10104
05:08:33,580 --> 05:08:34,320
Cheese and everything.

10105
05:08:34,720 --> 05:08:35,000
Yeah.

10106
05:08:35,100 --> 05:08:35,280
Yeah.

10107
05:08:36,340 --> 05:08:40,120
And then we'll have like a whole day dedicated to the naming ceremony.

10108
05:08:41,860 --> 05:08:42,300
Okay.

10109
05:08:42,620 --> 05:08:43,380
I'll do it.

10110
05:08:43,740 --> 05:08:44,620
Oh my god.

10111
05:08:44,640 --> 05:08:45,520
It'll be a such...

10112
05:08:45,520 --> 05:08:46,360
It'll be a celebration.

10113
05:08:46,760 --> 05:08:49,000
It'll be like an anniversary or something too.

10114
05:08:49,180 --> 05:08:49,780
Like your...

10115
05:08:49,780 --> 05:08:49,900
Yeah.

10116
05:08:50,380 --> 05:08:51,320
Your five year anniversary.

10117
05:08:51,680 --> 05:08:53,120
And then you're like, it's time to...

10118
05:08:53,120 --> 05:08:53,980
Five?

10119
05:08:54,460 --> 05:08:54,620
I don't know.

10120
05:08:54,620 --> 05:08:55,120
You'll be named.

10121
05:08:56,840 --> 05:08:59,000
Maybe I'll do it this year.

10122
05:08:59,120 --> 05:08:59,420
This year.

10123
05:08:59,420 --> 05:09:00,060
This one year anniversary.

10124
05:09:00,700 --> 05:09:01,000
This year?

10125
05:09:01,180 --> 05:09:01,840
Oh my god.

10126
05:09:02,420 --> 05:09:03,220
Oh my god.

10127
05:09:03,320 --> 05:09:03,960
Lil Doobs.

10128
05:09:04,200 --> 05:09:05,480
You'll be named soon.

10129
05:09:06,420 --> 05:09:06,700
Yeah.

10130
05:09:07,140 --> 05:09:07,420
Oh wait.

10131
05:09:07,600 --> 05:09:08,860
Speaking of special events.

10132
05:09:08,860 --> 05:09:09,300
Do you have...

10133
05:09:09,300 --> 05:09:09,560
Yeah.

10134
05:09:09,780 --> 05:09:10,860
Do you have any special events?

10135
05:09:10,980 --> 05:09:12,780
Don't you have some special events coming up soon?

10136
05:09:13,300 --> 05:09:14,300
So we can...

10137
05:09:14,300 --> 05:09:14,460
Oh.

10138
05:09:14,760 --> 05:09:15,720
Oh tomorrow.

10139
05:09:16,080 --> 05:09:17,460
There's a special stream tomorrow.

10140
05:09:17,800 --> 05:09:19,960
There's an announcement stream for something.

10141
05:09:20,560 --> 05:09:20,580
Really?

10142
05:09:20,640 --> 05:09:20,920
Yeah.

10143
05:09:21,580 --> 05:09:22,260
And then...

10144
05:09:22,260 --> 05:09:24,140
And then next month...

10145
05:09:24,140 --> 05:09:24,500
Uh...

10146
05:09:24,500 --> 05:09:26,580
There's an anime expo concert.

10147
05:09:26,720 --> 05:09:27,500
Birthday concert.

10148
05:09:27,820 --> 05:09:29,280
And then also...

10149
05:09:29,280 --> 05:09:31,760
Doobie also has a concert next month too!

10150
05:09:32,460 --> 05:09:32,960
Yeah!

10151
05:09:33,700 --> 05:09:33,880
Yeah.

10152
05:09:33,880 --> 05:09:36,380
A lot of exciting stuff happens at Anime Expo.

10153
05:09:36,580 --> 05:09:36,780
Yeah.

10154
05:09:36,920 --> 05:09:38,220
There's so many things going on.

10155
05:09:38,220 --> 05:09:41,580
To be honest, it's like the biggest anime convention too, so it makes sense.

10156
05:09:41,820 --> 05:09:41,960
Yeah.

10157
05:09:42,220 --> 05:09:43,500
Yeah, there's so many people there.

10158
05:09:44,360 --> 05:09:46,040
Oh, are you excited for your concert?

10159
05:09:47,580 --> 05:09:51,500
Yeah, I'm so excited for everybody to see the hard work everybody's putting in.

10160
05:09:51,980 --> 05:09:54,780
Yeah, I'm excited to see you dance again.

10161
05:09:55,700 --> 05:09:57,280
Oh, thank you.

10162
05:09:58,140 --> 05:10:01,980
I wish I could see your concert too, but it's like, you have to be there in person, right?

10163
05:10:02,180 --> 05:10:03,820
Yeah, yeah, so like...

10164
05:10:03,820 --> 05:10:04,640
Well, mine's a day...

10165
05:10:04,640 --> 05:10:05,340
I'll watch a video afterwards.

10166
05:10:05,340 --> 05:10:07,780
I think mine's like two days before yours, right?

10167
05:10:07,780 --> 05:10:09,200
Yours is on the 5th, right?

10168
05:10:10,140 --> 05:10:10,860
Yeah, it's on the 5th.

10169
05:10:10,960 --> 05:10:11,720
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

10170
05:10:12,440 --> 05:10:12,800
So...

10171
05:10:12,800 --> 05:10:13,460
I think...

10172
05:10:13,460 --> 05:10:13,640
Yeah.

10173
05:10:13,940 --> 05:10:17,360
I can catch your concert and you can catch my concert, I think.

10174
05:10:19,420 --> 05:10:21,140
Yeah, it's not overlapping at least.

10175
05:10:21,180 --> 05:10:21,620
That's good.

10176
05:10:21,840 --> 05:10:26,040
So like, for those who are going to Anime Expo, you can actually watch both our concerts at the...

10177
05:10:26,600 --> 05:10:28,220
Not same time, but like, you know.

10178
05:10:28,420 --> 05:10:30,880
If you're there, you might as well catch both of us, you know?

10179
05:10:31,000 --> 05:10:31,880
The D&Ds.

10180
05:10:32,000 --> 05:10:32,060
Yeah.

10181
05:10:33,300 --> 05:10:36,760
If you can't go for my concert, there are streaming tickets online.

10182
05:10:36,760 --> 05:10:37,300
Yeah.

10183
05:10:37,900 --> 05:10:41,760
Yeah, there's no streaming tickets for mine, but like, it'll be uploaded later.

10184
05:10:42,540 --> 05:10:42,760
Yes.

10185
05:10:42,920 --> 05:10:44,140
Like, the Blu-ray edition.

10186
05:10:44,760 --> 05:10:45,200
On Twitter.

10187
05:10:45,200 --> 05:10:45,480
On Twitter.

10188
05:10:45,480 --> 05:10:45,700
Oh, really?

10189
05:10:45,900 --> 05:10:46,060
Yeah.

10190
05:10:46,920 --> 05:10:51,100
Well, like, yeah, I'm planning on uploading my concert on YouTube, like, fully.

10191
05:10:51,700 --> 05:10:52,140
Later.

10192
05:10:52,520 --> 05:10:52,860
Yeah.

10193
05:10:53,680 --> 05:10:53,880
Nice.

10194
05:10:54,460 --> 05:10:54,860
Yippee!

10195
05:10:54,860 --> 05:10:59,280
And then I hope the copyright law, like, copyright lawyers don't get me.

10196
05:10:59,720 --> 05:11:00,000
Oh.

10197
05:11:00,420 --> 05:11:00,800
Yeah.

10198
05:11:01,000 --> 05:11:02,440
Well, as long as you don't monetize it.

10199
05:11:02,560 --> 05:11:02,620
Yeah.

10200
05:11:02,620 --> 05:11:04,780
Like, I put copyright stuff all the time, but...

10201
05:11:04,780 --> 05:11:05,900
Yeah, as long as...

10202
05:11:05,900 --> 05:11:07,280
Yeah, they can take the money.

10203
05:11:07,500 --> 05:11:07,860
It's alright.

10204
05:11:07,860 --> 05:11:09,840
They need more...

10205
05:11:09,840 --> 05:11:10,040
Yeah.

10206
05:11:10,040 --> 05:11:11,240
They need more money anyway.

10207
05:11:12,220 --> 05:11:12,920
Do they?

10208
05:11:13,140 --> 05:11:13,780
Do they really?

10209
05:11:14,800 --> 05:11:15,320
Hi, me.

10210
05:11:15,500 --> 05:11:17,080
The millionaires need more money.

10211
05:11:17,640 --> 05:11:17,740
Yeah.

10212
05:11:21,100 --> 05:11:23,220
I'll see you later, Doobie.

10213
05:11:23,660 --> 05:11:25,820
Thank you for inviting me to play.

10214
05:11:25,980 --> 05:11:26,100
Yeah.

10215
05:11:26,100 --> 05:11:26,920
Hope you have a nice night.

10216
05:11:27,300 --> 05:11:27,360
Yeah.

10217
05:11:27,360 --> 05:11:27,620
Me too.

10218
05:11:28,120 --> 05:11:30,860
I hope you rest well, because I know you might be crashing from caffeine.

10219
05:11:31,680 --> 05:11:32,040
Probably.

10220
05:11:32,320 --> 05:11:32,520
Yeah.

10221
05:11:32,960 --> 05:11:33,080
Yeah.

10222
05:11:33,620 --> 05:11:33,960
Alright.

10223
05:11:34,500 --> 05:11:35,000
GG's.

10224
05:11:35,700 --> 05:11:36,200
GG's.

10225
05:11:36,580 --> 05:11:36,980
Bye-bye.

10226
05:11:37,000 --> 05:11:37,520
Bye-bye.

10227
05:11:40,900 --> 05:11:41,400
Wow!

10228
05:11:41,800 --> 05:11:42,620
That was fun.

10229
05:11:42,740 --> 05:11:45,000
I had a great time with Doobie.

10230
05:11:45,140 --> 05:11:50,520
I can't believe we were on streaming for, like, five plus hours.

10231
05:11:50,860 --> 05:11:51,740
I am...

10232
05:11:51,740 --> 05:11:53,160
I think she's tired.

10233
05:11:53,160 --> 05:11:54,120
I'm tired.

10234
05:11:54,120 --> 05:11:54,960
I'm...

10235
05:11:54,960 --> 05:11:56,440
Like, you know, like, the...

10236
05:11:57,280 --> 05:11:58,100
What's the word?

10237
05:11:58,360 --> 05:12:02,800
You know, like, um, after a while, like, the...

10238
05:12:02,800 --> 05:12:04,600
The adrenaline...

10239
05:12:04,600 --> 05:12:06,060
The adrenaline dies down.

10240
05:12:06,280 --> 05:12:07,820
Yeah, my adrenaline's gone now.

10241
05:12:09,920 --> 05:12:10,820
How does he know?

10242
05:12:10,980 --> 05:12:12,960
I don't know how dad knows every time.

10243
05:12:12,960 --> 05:12:15,160
He knows exactly when I'm about to end stream.

10244
05:12:15,320 --> 05:12:15,740
It's crazy.

10245
05:12:16,080 --> 05:12:18,440
I guess it's like my tone of voice or some shit.

10246
05:12:18,900 --> 05:12:20,240
But I had a great time.

10247
05:12:20,380 --> 05:12:21,780
I had a great time playing with Doobie.

10248
05:12:21,780 --> 05:12:23,780
Um, it was fun learning CS.

10249
05:12:24,100 --> 05:12:30,140
I think, uh, um, I learned a lot playing CS, uh, with her.

10250
05:12:30,340 --> 05:12:31,020
She's a good teacher.

10251
05:12:31,540 --> 05:12:33,660
Um, and I had a fun time.

10252
05:12:33,940 --> 05:12:35,780
I'm repeating a lot because I'm tired.

10253
05:12:40,100 --> 05:12:42,640
I had a walk dad as soon as stream ends.

10254
05:12:42,860 --> 05:12:44,260
Uh, cause it's walkies time.

10255
05:12:44,400 --> 05:12:45,380
I also need to give his medicine.

10256
05:12:47,100 --> 05:12:49,080
But thank you, everybody, for coming.

10257
05:12:49,400 --> 05:12:50,980
I'm gonna head off now.

10258
05:12:50,980 --> 05:12:54,240
I didn't think we were streaming so long, but I had so much fun.

10259
05:12:54,400 --> 05:12:55,480
I had so much fun playing over.

10260
05:12:56,480 --> 05:12:57,680
But thank you everyone for coming.

10261
05:12:57,820 --> 05:13:00,220
As always, everybody, stay hydrated, posture-checked.

10262
05:13:00,280 --> 05:13:01,820
Get everyone around to get that blood flowing.

10263
05:13:01,940 --> 05:13:05,180
And if you stay up for me, head to bed, because you deserve it.

10264
05:13:05,320 --> 05:13:06,540
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

10265
05:13:06,940 --> 05:13:07,580
Bye, guys!

10266
05:13:08,480 --> 05:13:08,800
Bye!
