1
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,380
Oh, sorry.

2
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,800
I forgot.

3
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,260
Sorry, that's a screenshot.

4
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:54,940
Let me turn that off.

5
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,420
I forgot I had that on.

6
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,740
I was like, whoa, whoops.

7
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,640
I'm sorry, I just woke up not okay right now.

8
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:12,620
I just woke up ten minutes ago because I needed nap time.

9
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,820
Hello, good morning, I'm back.

10
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,880
MrBrokenBot, thank you for the super chat.

11
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,040
Thank you, thank you.

12
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:28,160
Doki, waking up just minutes before stream doesn't help with your brain bug.

13
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,940
Thank you for the super chat.

14
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,260
Thank you, thank you.

15
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,220
Gus, thank you for the magenta super.

16
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,000
Thank you, thank you.

17
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:42,180
Hi Doki, you most likely won't be able to read the chat in battle, so here is the back seating.

18
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,340
Dodge, dodge, attack now.

19
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,800
Stop attacking and dodge.

20
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,580
Run, heal.

21
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,680
Dodge, attack.

22
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,760
You should have dodged that.

23
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,380
Watch out for the cliff.

24
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,480
Have fun.

25
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,120
Thank you for the magenta super.

26
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,620
Thank you, thank you.

27
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:58,840
Okay, so, um, for those who are wondering about my brain fog, it is...

28
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,880
Oh, sorry, I'm on my recording settings.

29
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,320
Oh my god, I'm all over the place.

30
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:06,700
I...

31
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,440
Okay, okay, now, now things are okay.

32
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,480
Uh...

33
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:14,680
Uh...

34
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,860
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

35
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:16,920
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

36
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,280
Too much text.

37
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,240
All you need is spam R1.

38
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,160
Ah, thank you for the super chat.

39
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,200
Thank you, thank you.

40
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:24,240
Thank you.

41
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,980
No, not, not spam.

42
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,000
All I need is a message and praise.

43
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,980
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

44
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,480
And then I can take everything.

45
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,960
Sorry, now, now!

46
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,980
Now, everything should be okay now.

47
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:41,960
Um, okay, I don't know if my brain fog is still there.

48
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,440
It doesn't help that I literally just woke up.

49
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:54,680
Uh, because, um... Um, um, I was very, I don't know, I was just very tired today because dad keeps, like, being a little fucking asshole.

50
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,620
I gave him bed privileges today.

51
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:03,160
Like, my bed privileges for, like, you know, for today because I was very weak.

52
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,640
Um, and then he, like, jumped off my bed.

53
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,020
Not once, but twice.

54
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:15,160
So, so I had, like, fear because he was doing so well.

55
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,760
I, like, let him, let him on my bed, like, this morning.

56
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,880
Uh, because he was, like, whining and stuff.

57
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,200
So I was just like, okay, I'll, I'll, like, let you up in the bed.

58
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,160
Um, because he whines less when he's sleeping next to me.

59
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:36,680
And then, you know, he walked up and walked down from the actual, uh, from, like, from, with the stairs.

60
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,160
So I was like, okay, because I wanted to test him.

61
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,460
I was like, alright, will you use the stairs when you go down?

62
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,300
And he was like, yes, I will.

63
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,940
I definitely will.

64
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:45,580
Please.

65
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,140
Please, sir, can I please be on the bed?

66
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:52,380
And I was like, okay, you've proved to me that you can use the stairs when you go down.

67
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,740
So, I'll let you up.

68
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,700
And then, silly me, he conned me.

69
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,240
He conned me into using my bed.

70
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,140
Because the moment he was, like, he was there for, like, 15 minutes.

71
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,200
And then he, like, jumped off the bed.

72
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,240
And I was like, are you fucking, for no reason!

73
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,680
He just, like, jumped off the bed.

74
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,920
And then he, like, and then I saw that he did that.

75
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,040
And I was like, no!

76
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,280
So then I pushed his stairs away.

77
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,900
But, obviously, it wasn't too far away.

78
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:24,960
Because I laid back down, closed my eyes, and then he was next to me.

79
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,200
And I was like, how?

80
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:34,300
And I was just like, like, I don't know if he takes this as, like, a form of entertainment.

81
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,420
Because he was like, I broke my back once doing this.

82
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,680
But she can just fix me.

83
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,520
So, there's no consequences now.

84
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,960
And so, it's because I didn't push the stairs far enough.

85
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,840
So, he climbed up on the stairs at the top.

86
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:54,340
And then he, like, used the stairs as, like, a ram to, like, jump to the bed.

87
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,200
Because there was, like, a little gap between the bed and the stairs.

88
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,120
Because I didn't push it.

89
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,780
I didn't push it too far enough!

90
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:04,080
So, then he was like, you think this tiny gap is gonna stop me?

91
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,380
So, I assume he just jumped over the tiny gap.

92
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,080
I don't know.

93
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,600
Because I was, like, closed my eyes.

94
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,020
And then I felt him next to me.

95
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,560
He just wants to feel alive again, you know?

96
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,160
The risk of breaking his back just makes him feel alive.

97
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,920
And then he jumped off the bed again.

98
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:23,800
Again.

99
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,040
But he didn't do it instantly.

100
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,040
He was just like...

101
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,680
He was just like, I'm done being on top of you.

102
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,200
On top of your legs.

103
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,660
I'm going back on the ground now.

104
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,240
And then he like jumped off again.

105
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:38,000
And at that point, I like pushed the stairs.

106
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,580
I pushed the stairs out of my room because I don't trust him anymore.

107
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:48,990
Yeah, he's an adrenaline junkie right now.

108
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,070
Anyway, that's not the actual dad update.

109
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,810
The dad update is like more fucked up.

110
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,710
I have like pictures.

111
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:03,930
Okay, let me grab the pictures real quick.

112
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:05,710
Okay, so...

113
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:08,930
Today, I have like several dad updates, but I'm gonna like...

114
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,850
What's that word?

115
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:14,810
Where like I want to like...

116
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:17,830
I'm gonna stagger the stories into several streams.

117
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:20,130
Because there's several dad updates.

118
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,810
But I'll tell you about the stuff that was going on today.

119
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:24,810
Uh...

120
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,910
Yeah, I'm gonna space them out.

121
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,010
Um...

122
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,170
Let me grab the picture real quick.

123
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:33,410
To illustrate my story better.

124
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,010
Alright, so...

125
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:35,770
It's a little...

126
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:37,150
It's like a little fucked up.

127
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,420
Okay.

128
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,420
Alright.

129
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,040
So...

130
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:46,740
Um...

131
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,080
Today...

132
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,880
During Walkie's time.

133
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:50,980
At the...

134
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:51,700
Oh my gosh.

135
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,220
I just realized I did not close anything.

136
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,440
I'm sorry.

137
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,260
I was taking like screenshots for thumbnails.

138
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,700
And then I realized...

139
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,540
Give me a sec.

140
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,960
Let me fix this real quick.

141
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:02,760
I'm...

142
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,840
I'm a mess.

143
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:04,580
I'm...

144
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,980
I've been a mess for a while.

145
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:06,640
I...

146
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,740
I've been so busy.

147
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:09,520
Alright.

148
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:10,840
Um...

149
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,400
I debate...

150
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,460
I debate about whether or not to stream today.

151
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,780
But I was like, maybe it'll be okay.

152
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,580
But...

153
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,520
Like clearly I'm...

154
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:16,940
I'm...

155
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,100
I'm a mess right...

156
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,840
I'm a mess right now and still am.

157
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:20,460
Anyway.

158
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:21,820
Um...

159
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:26,620
So I took Dad to the dog park today.

160
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:27,420
And...

161
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:31,160
We encountered those big, white, fluffy dogs.

162
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,620
The...

163
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,100
I don't even remember what they're called again.

164
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,900
I always forget what they're called.

165
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,040
The...

166
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,160
They're not the Eskimo dogs.

167
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:38,820
God damn it.

168
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,460
I always forgot what they're called.

169
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:41,520
Um...

170
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,240
The Samoyeds.

171
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,240
Yes, the Samoyeds.

172
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:43,540
Okay.

173
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,880
So we encountered...

174
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:45,940
Um...

175
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,000
The Samoyed.

176
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,060
So...

177
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:48,740
Dad...

178
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,160
Thought...

179
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,800
It was his Samoyed.

180
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,380
You know?

181
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,800
The freaky lady.

182
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,300
The one that would lick his ears.

183
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,080
And everything.

184
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,280
And he got super excited.

185
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,540
Cause he didn't give a fuck about the other dogs.

186
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,200
Like...

187
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,580
He ignores the other dogs.

188
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,720
Cause there were like two other...

189
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,500
Three other dogs there.

190
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,240
And he was ignoring them.

191
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,900
But when the Samoyed came over.

192
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,420
He was so excited.

193
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,420
He was like...

194
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,940
Trying to get their attention.

195
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:11,740
Um...

196
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:11,940
Um...

197
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,980
Make sure you like...

198
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,200
Focus on the pronoun using right now.

199
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,040
But...

200
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,440
He was focusing on their attention.

201
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,420
When was like...

202
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,180
In front of...

203
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:21,920
In front of them.

204
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,820
And was like...

205
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:23,440
Was like...

206
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,500
Like jumping on them.

207
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,800
And the front would be like...

208
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,020
Oh!

209
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,060
Pay attention to me!

210
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,080
Pay attention to me!

211
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:34,460
And then when the Samoyed finally, like, looked at him and like, looked at him and was like, oh, hey, you exist.

212
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,080
Dad, like, instantly got us back.

213
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:37,880
He's like, yes!

214
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:38,900
Come on!

215
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,000
You freak!

216
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,720
You know what you want to do.

217
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:53,640
But then, we realized, both Dad and I realized, this wasn't the same Samoyed that he fell in love with.

218
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:03,580
Because, because, um, this Samoyed, also, there's, like, people watching.

219
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:20,780
But, this Samoyed, the moment Dad got him on his belly, this Samoyed went lower and lower.

220
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:44,660
And, and, and, and then, from, at that moment, we realized that this Samoyed was not Dad's favorite freaky lady.

221
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:48,180
It was, in fact, a freaky man.

222
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:07,860
So, so, so, this, the male Samoyed, every, and then Dad was like, wait, this is, this isn't what, this isn't what I, what I wanted.

223
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:17,500
So, Dad instantly rolled back, you know, like, rolled back and was like, hey, no, no, this isn't, this isn't you.

224
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,240
I want the ear lickies, let's do this again.

225
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:30,480
And then, he, like, rolled back on his stomach, like, rolled back onto his back, and, and the Samoyed still kept,

226
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:38,120
still, still kept licking down there.

227
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,240
And then, so then, Dad was like, okay, wait, stop.

228
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:48,640
And then, he got back onto his legs, but then the, and, like, was like, hey, no, no.

229
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,160
And was like, walking away.

230
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:59,560
And then the Samoyed was still trying to lick down there, but like, while just like, you know, he just like, lowered his head.

231
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,720
And while Dad was like, walking away.

232
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,000
And he's just like, the fuck are you doing?

233
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:15,240
Like, he was literally trying to walk away, and the Samoyed was like, obsessed with licking down there.

234
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,200
And then, so like, I was like, okay.

235
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,020
And Dad was very uncomfortable.

236
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:23,600
He was like, he was like, oh my God, like, get away from me.

237
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,480
Like, he was like, hey, get away!

238
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,600
Get away from me!

239
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,920
But he wouldn't stop.

240
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,000
The Samoyed wouldn't stop.

241
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,700
He was like, chasing him around.

242
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,920
He was like, you think this is over?

243
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,180
Like, you were the one that invited this.

244
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,720
You invited me!

245
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,300
You wanted my attention!

246
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:49,080
And so, so then I was like, okay, I have to intervene.

247
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,140
Because Dad was actually getting like, really angry now.

248
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:56,400
And he was like, he was actually like whimpering, like, not whimpering, but like, yelping.

249
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,800
He was like, get away!

250
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,280
He was like, HR!

251
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,480
He was actually yelling for HR at that point.

252
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,240
Because like, the Samoyed wouldn't stop.

253
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,860
So, so I picked him up.

254
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,440
Because, I picked him up.

255
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,780
Because I was like, okay, you're clearly uncomfortable.

256
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,880
I needed, he wanted me to call the cops.

257
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,480
And so, I picked him up.

258
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,040
And then he was like, he was really happy.

259
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,080
He was like, oh my God, thank God, thank you.

260
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:28,040
Like, get me away from this fucking freak.

261
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:35,860
And then, and then, the Samoyed was like, this isn't, you think this is over?

262
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,440
This isn't over.

263
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,720
And then the Samoyed fucking tried.

264
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,180
Oh my God.

265
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,920
Oh my God.

266
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:48,300
He like, he jumped on me.

267
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,840
Like, and you know how big they are?

268
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,340
So like, he jumped on me.

269
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,880
And was like, using my body as like, a perch.

270
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,640
You know, like a tool.

271
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,860
And then just started helping.

272
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,980
Because he thought I was like, a part of him, I guess.

273
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:06,280
So, I guess I was like, oh my God.

274
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,620
And then the owner.

275
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,100
And he, the owner.

276
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,700
And the dad was like, get away.

277
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,560
I was like, yo figure.

278
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,660
I was like, get away.

279
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,840
And then the owner came over and was like, I'm so sorry.

280
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,500
And like, pulled him away from us.

281
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:31,240
And then the dad's like, yeah, get away from us.

282
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,660
And then the Samoyed was like, this isn't over.

283
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,500
The dog, the Samoyed was like, this isn't over.

284
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,700
You wanted this.

285
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,080
Holy shit.

286
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,340
That dog was so fucking freaky.

287
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:54,260
All dad wanted was his ears to get licked.

288
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,580
And then he invited.

289
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,380
But it was mistaken identity.

290
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,640
He thought it was the freaky lady.

291
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,940
But it was the freaky man.

292
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:09,440
And then he fucking invited a chain reaction.

293
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,200
And then, and then when the owner pulled him away.

294
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,800
The Samoyed was like, looking at me.

295
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,220
Cause I had to like, hold him.

296
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:24,340
Cause that was just like, cause I was worried that dad might try to go back to him.

297
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,040
And was like, oh maybe I was wrong.

298
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,500
You know, cause like, he kept doing that.

299
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,460
The first time I pulled him away.

300
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,780
And like he kept going back to, to Samoyed.

301
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,360
So, cause he thinks like, okay, I'm gonna try this again.

302
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,480
I'm gonna roll it on my stomach.

303
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,720
I'm gonna roll it on my back.

304
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,980
And then you're gonna lick my ears.

305
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:40,300
Okay.

306
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,160
Like, we're gonna try this again.

307
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,000
And then, you know, he kept trying.

308
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:47,900
But then, obviously, it wasn't him.

309
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,040
It wasn't the dog that he was looking for.

310
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,700
Anyway, so I was like holding him.

311
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,140
And then the Samoya was like looking at us.

312
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,380
And he was like, this isn't over.

313
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,840
And he started barking at me and dad.

314
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,000
He's like, this isn't over.

315
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:15,280
And then dad was like, I think he was like, like, I don't know if he was crying.

316
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:18,980
Or like, because he wasn't, it wasn't tears, but he was like yelping.

317
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:24,200
He was like, oh my god.

318
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,140
He's like traumatizing.

319
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,700
Because it wasn't like a bark.

320
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,640
He was actually like whimpering.

321
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,080
He's like, oh my god.

322
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:36,520
Motherfucking.

323
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:40,580
Samoya was like, rawr, rawr, like at us.

324
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,720
And I'm like, oh my god.

325
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:47,060
I was like, holy shit.

326
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,920
Like the rollercoaster of emotions.

327
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,540
And everything.

328
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,180
I was crazy.

329
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:58,520
I was like, are you okay?

330
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:05,400
And then, and then like the older is like, yeah, we're gonna, we're gonna leave now.

331
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,000
Because like...

332
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,920
He's like, she's like, we're gonna, we're gonna, leave now.

333
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:11,920
Like okay.

334
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,680
And then, and then like, and then a pug came over.

335
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:20,740
And then the owner was like, oh no, he hates that pug.

336
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:27,320
And then the pug in the Samoyans started barking.

337
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,820
He's like, yeah, that's right!

338
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:29,640
Leave!

339
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:30,900
The pug was like, leave!

340
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,080
This is my dog, Pug!

341
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,500
And it was a fucking tiny pug.

342
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:37,920
I don't know what the... This was like some fucking K-drama.

343
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:44,060
And then dad was just like watching and yelping because he doesn't like it when the other dogs start fighting.

344
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,720
And then like those two dogs started like barking each other.

345
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,520
And then dad was like, oh!

346
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:54,800
After hearing, after hearing like listening to the fight, he's like, oh!

347
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:05,040
Anyway, and then yeah, and then the Samoyans left and I put him back on the ground.

348
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,160
And then he finally pooped.

349
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,720
The reason why I even stayed for this lot was because he wasn't pooping.

350
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,520
And then finally the Samoyans left and then he... I put him back down.

351
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,720
And then he pooped.

352
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,860
And I was like, oh, thank God.

353
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,100
And now I was able to go home.

354
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:30,420
And he had a very rough day today.

355
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,420
It was a wild day at the dog park.

356
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:36,420
I didn't realize there were two Samoyans here.

357
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,360
Devlin, thank you for the super chat.

358
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,280
Thank you.

359
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:49,200
With drama like this, who needs telenovelas or primetime reality TV shows?

360
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,540
Thank you for the super chat.

361
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:50,860
Thank you.

362
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,240
Thank you.

363
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:54,020
Yes, all of this happened today.

364
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,900
But yeah, it was crazy.

365
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:04,340
If you saw in the beginning, it was Dad that was trying to get his attention.

366
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,900
Because the Samoyan was ignoring him.

367
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,380
And he was just interacting with the other dogs.

368
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,620
And Dad was, he was ignoring Dad.

369
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,540
And Dad actually like went up to his face.

370
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:22,500
And started like, like, you know, like, you know when they're like, trying to like, perch up on him.

371
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,940
Like, okay, I'll illustrate this.

372
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,020
And he was like, no, pay attention to me.

373
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,100
Don't you remember who I am?

374
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,280
And then like, obviously the Samoyan was like, I don't know who you are.

375
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:35,740
And then Dad was the one that was trying to get his attention.

376
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:36,920
And it worked.

377
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,300
But then he didn't realize it wasn't the dog.

378
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:43,900
It wasn't the dog he actually wanted to get attention from.

379
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,080
So, okay.

380
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,280
So this was basically...

381
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,140
Okay, I'll illustrate this real quick.

382
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:56,060
So, and then Dad was like, okay, I'm drawing this on paint.

383
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:58,800
And he's like, he's like, whoo!

384
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:10,100
And then, uh, he's like...

385
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,120
Little did he know.

386
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,060
Little did he know.

387
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,460
It would have led to like, fucking trauma.

388
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,060
I was like, holy fuck.

389
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:29,760
I...

390
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,920
Like, I did not realize it would escalate this much.

391
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,180
He was so innocent.

392
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,440
Well, not really that innocent.

393
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,840
Because he wanted to get his fucking ears licked.

394
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:41,700
But, okay.

395
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,760
This is basically what it looked like.

396
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,080
Um...

397
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,480
So this was what he was doing.

398
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,980
And he like, did that to him for like...

399
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:53,400
He would did that to him for like, 30 seconds.

400
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,700
Because the Samoyed was like, ignoring him at first.

401
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,240
But then he kept like, wow...

402
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,420
He kept like, walking in front of him.

403
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,540
And was like, don't you remember me?

404
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,320
And then like...

405
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,720
And then when he finally paid attention to him.

406
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,100
Dad like, rolled onto his back.

407
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,620
And was like, yeah, come on.

408
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,320
Don't you remember your licky time?

409
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,660
Come on.

410
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,160
Come on.

411
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,260
Because he would never...

412
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,180
He wouldn't do that.

413
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,060
Um...

414
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:23,800
To any other dog.

415
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,940
I've never seen him done this to any other dog.

416
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,320
Because he would like, never initiate.

417
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,060
But this was like...

418
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:29,520
Um...

419
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,460
This was like, the first time I've ever seen him like, initiate.

420
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,960
For like...

421
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,480
Um...

422
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,160
For to play.

423
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,880
I assume that's playing.

424
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:37,760
I...

425
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,600
I don't like the ear licks.

426
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,000
I assume the ear licks was like, his form of playing.

427
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,060
So it was...

428
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:50,320
It was the first time I've ever seen him do that to another dog.

429
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:54,120
Because he would ignore other dogs when he tried to like, approach him or initiate.

430
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,180
And then...

431
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,080
But it was mistaken identity.

432
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,520
The wrong dog.

433
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:00,900
The wrong...

434
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:08,580
That was the dad update for today.

435
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:09,520
Um...

436
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,320
He's okay now.

437
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,560
He's sleeping.

438
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:12,680
Uh...

439
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,940
And had good food.

440
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:14,680
Um...

441
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,020
So he's okay now, guys.

442
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,180
Holy shit.

443
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:18,920
But it was...

444
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,780
Fucking...

445
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,900
It was fucking wild this morning.

446
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,940
Anyway, today we're playing Elder Ring.

447
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:27,980
Alright.

448
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,520
Oh my god.

449
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,300
Please, I'm playing in my controller right now.

450
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:35,740
Alright.

451
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:38,700
Alright.

452
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,240
More Elder Ring time.

453
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,580
I don't know if today's gonna be a lot...

454
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,540
Today might not be a super long stream today.

455
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:44,720
Because, uh...

456
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,940
I'm still like...

457
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:46,660
Um...

458
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,100
I still...

459
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:50,820
I don't know yet if I still have like a bad brain fog at the moment.

460
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:52,540
Um...

461
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,840
Because I haven't streamed in three days.

462
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,060
So like, we'll see how this stream goes.

463
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,000
And then like...

464
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,540
Then that's gonna help me decide for next week.

465
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,740
Of how long...

466
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,820
If I'm gonna take another three-day break for next week.

467
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,180
Like...

468
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,000
Three-day back-to-back-to-back break.

469
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,460
And then after the birthday thing...

470
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,440
I think it's just...

471
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,680
I'm just really stressed out about the birthday stuff.

472
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,420
And the concert.

473
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,060
I think that's also contributing to the fact that like...

474
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,320
I'm all over the place.

475
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,400
Because of like...

476
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,500
The whole birthday stuff.

477
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,620
That's going on.

478
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,140
That I'm trying to...

479
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:22,840
Um...

480
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,280
I'm trying to like...

481
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,020
Work on.

482
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:25,480
Basically.

483
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,000
Work and prep for.

484
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:29,980
Next week.

485
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:30,940
Thank you for the super chat.

486
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:31,260
Thank you.

487
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:31,800
Thank you.

488
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:32,560
Hi, Doki.

489
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,160
It was great getting to see you at Off-Kai Expo.

490
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,560
Since you mentioned at the panel...

491
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,400
I just want to say...

492
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,260
That we did not mean for the tomato water balloons to look so sus.

493
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,140
Sorry about that.

494
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,560
Looking great.

495
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:45,160
Thank you for the super chat.

496
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:45,660
Thank you.

497
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:46,480
Thank you.

498
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,340
Are you...

499
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:47,960
Okay.

500
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:48,780
But next week.

501
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,540
Are you sure?

502
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,560
Because the only reason...

503
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,480
I realized...

504
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,400
That...

505
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,660
The reason...

506
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,320
How I found out...

507
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,320
That it was sus...

508
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,480
Was because...

509
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,120
One of...

510
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,300
The person...

511
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,480
Who helped you in designing this...

512
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,380
Drew something...

513
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:13,600
That was similar to the water balloons.

514
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,260
That was very, very sus.

515
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,380
Before they designed this outfit.

516
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,880
So are you sure?

517
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,140
Are you...

518
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,040
Okay.

519
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,720
But thank you for the super chat.

520
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,420
Thank you.

521
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,500
Thank you.

522
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,100
And that was...

523
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,360
The reason...

524
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,610
How I found out...

525
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,480
What they actually...

526
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,100
What it sort of looks like.

527
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,300
Alright.

528
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,180
Let me double check the sound.

529
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,580
It's like...

530
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,540
Teehee, pero...

531
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,480
Okay.

532
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:51,820
Uh...

533
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,160
Where is...

534
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,520
Where is my...

535
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,660
Elden ring...

536
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,500
Sound settings.

537
00:26:58,940 --> 00:26:59,440
Also, guys.

538
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,020
I forgot to save the...

539
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,580
I forgot to save the...

540
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,440
Halo sound settings.

541
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,700
So we're gonna have to figure that out.

542
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:08,000
We're gonna have to figure that out tomorrow.

543
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,760
The sound guys are gonna have to help me on that.

544
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:11,860
Uh...

545
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:12,060
Alright.

546
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,400
Here we go.

547
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:26,670
Oh no.

548
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:28,030
Alright.

549
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:29,070
Nice.

550
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:29,650
Oh wait.

551
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:30,810
Do I have enough to upgrade?

552
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:31,890
I actually don't know.

553
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:33,910
Let's see.

554
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:35,190
Blah, blah, blah.

555
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:35,810
Okay.

556
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:36,510
I need 15.

557
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:36,730
Wait.

558
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:37,510
I have enough...

559
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:38,490
Uh...

560
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,230
I have enough...

561
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:39,930
Uh...

562
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:40,690
Runes for that.

563
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:44,070
I should have enough.

564
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:45,610
Let's see.

565
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:45,890
Oh yeah.

566
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:46,550
2,000?

567
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:47,670
I just need to do one.

568
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:48,910
Yay!

569
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:51,950
Oh wait.

570
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:52,350
Fuck!

571
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:54,090
Okay.

572
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:54,910
It's not...

573
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:55,490
I...

574
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:57,630
I actually needed like 100 more.

575
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:58,850
Give me a sec.

576
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:00,790
Uh...

577
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:02,210
You know how can you just kill one thing?

578
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:03,950
I think it was like 15...

579
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:04,250
No.

580
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:04,710
Fuck it.

581
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:05,550
I don't wanna risk it.

582
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,470
I'll just use it now.

583
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,110
I miscalculated.

584
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:11,690
Almost failed math in high school.

585
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:12,830
Alright.

586
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:13,590
Guys.

587
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,010
What are we doing for this?

588
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:16,430
This is a chap...

589
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:17,190
This is a...

590
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:17,550
Uh...

591
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:19,110
Well, this is the influencer build.

592
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,770
But this is a...

593
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:21,710
Chat level up system.

594
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,490
At chat.

595
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:24,550
What next?

596
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:25,690
Vigor?

597
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:26,130
Okay.

598
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:31,350
We'll do Vigor.

599
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:34,110
Alright.

600
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:34,890
That should be good.

601
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,200
Also apparently...

602
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,120
Do I...

603
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,820
Do I use...

604
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:44,200
Wait.

605
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:44,600
What?

606
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:48,220
Did I not kill the magma worm?

607
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,260
Wait.

608
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:54,860
Oh, there it is.

609
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,880
Oh, it's a great sword.

610
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,200
I thought the magma worm gives a katana.

611
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,900
Oh, I did.

612
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:02,720
Okay.

613
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:03,340
Never mind.

614
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,780
I thought it gives like...

615
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:07,200
Like, some katana thing.

616
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,460
But I guess it didn't.

617
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:10,380
No?

618
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,120
Oh, wait.

619
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,820
Because it like popped up in my YouTube short.

620
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,120
Because I guess like...

621
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,380
I don't know.

622
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,700
I think because I would...

623
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:21,180
My YouTube algorithm would like change to like...

624
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:21,880
Elden Ring stuff.

625
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,100
So...

626
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,760
Oh, it's a different boss.

627
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:25,180
Okay.

628
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,000
So like...

629
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:26,600
They're like...

630
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,540
Here are the katanas...

631
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:30,000
Here are the best katanas to use in Elden Ring.

632
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:30,600
And then they're like...

633
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,100
Like, if you kill the magma worm...

634
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,140
You'll get this katana called the...

635
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,120
Moon something.

636
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,440
And then I was like...

637
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:36,620
Oh!

638
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:37,900
Hey!

639
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,840
The YouTube algorithm's working!

640
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,280
So I was like...

641
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:43,620
Oh, yeah.

642
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:43,840
Wait.

643
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,680
I killed the...

644
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,300
I was like...

645
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:45,500
Wait.

646
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,420
Didn't I kill a giant fire lizard before?

647
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,620
I was like...

648
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,300
Let me grab this...

649
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:51,920
Like...

650
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,760
I can't believe chat tried to hold out on me.

651
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,380
And try to make me use a shitty katana.

652
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:00,120
Where I could be using this cool ass magma katana.

653
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:01,340
But...

654
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,340
It was jokes on me.

655
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,900
I just didn't even have it.

656
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,620
There was like...

657
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,740
Four of them.

658
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:07,860
Jokes on me.

659
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,220
I just didn't have...

660
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,320
The magma worm.

661
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,260
The actual real magma worm.

662
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:16,640
It's the other lava dragon.

663
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:20,580
Moonfellus for nerds.

664
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,540
Aw, shit.

665
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,840
I gotta be a magic...

666
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,700
God damn it.

667
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,440
Fucking stupid nerds.

668
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,660
Taking over all the good magma...

669
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,680
I mean...

670
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,960
Taking up all the other good katanas.

671
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,880
Alan, thank you for the super chat.

672
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:35,280
Thank you.

673
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:35,700
Thank you.

674
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,340
That's a magic katana.

675
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,040
What are you?

676
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:38,840
A nerd?

677
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,800
Do we need to stuff you into a locker nerd?

678
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,500
Those damn intelligent builders.

679
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,800
I swear to God.

680
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,860
Alright, where do we...

681
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:48,200
Okay.

682
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,940
I don't know where to go now.

683
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,640
I mean, I could...

684
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:53,600
Explore...

685
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,320
Oh, maybe...

686
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,560
Oh yeah, we're gonna do the well.

687
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,160
I forgot.

688
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,180
Let's go back to the well.

689
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,500
Wait, is it the...

690
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,360
Is that the well?

691
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,280
Actually...

692
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,320
Oh, wait.

693
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:04,780
Yeah.

694
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:05,560
Here.

695
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,920
We're supposed to do this area.

696
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,660
Devlin, thank you for the super chat.

697
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,680
Thank you, thank you.

698
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,180
Alright.

699
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:13,160
Alright.

700
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,520
We're supposed to do this area.

701
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,600
Okay, most likely...

702
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:16,860
I don't know.

703
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,380
I might stream for like two hours today.

704
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:18,960
Maybe.

705
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,620
I'm not sure though.

706
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,980
Depends on how I feel after two hours.

707
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,140
Wee!

708
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,480
Yeah, we still have like several more torches to do.

709
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,880
Here, the longest...

710
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,220
The longest elevator of my life.

711
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,360
They should really...

712
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:41,220
They should really like put elevator music here.

713
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:42,960
Oh, wait.

714
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:43,660
This is pretty short.

715
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,820
Oh, it's because it's elevated.

716
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:45,620
Okay, nice.

717
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,020
That was a shorter ride.

718
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,020
Which is nice.

719
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:51,560
Oh, my God.

720
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,420
It's stupid magic archers.

721
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:54,340
I...

722
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:54,940
Oh, my God.

723
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:55,880
I fucking hate them.

724
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,020
Uh...

725
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,100
Are there any other...

726
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,200
Okay, we need a...

727
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:00,800
We need a...

728
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,980
We need a ride past these guys.

729
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:03,960
These guys fucking suck.

730
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:09,680
Oh, my God.

731
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:09,820
All right.

732
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,680
Gotta make sure we don't get hit by them.

733
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:13,140
Oh, hey.

734
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:13,860
There's Grace here.

735
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,220
Nice.

736
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,060
Yeah, they're stupid aimbot.

737
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:18,920
They're cheating.

738
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,260
They went through anti-cheat to get here.

739
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,420
Maybe I can kill one of them.

740
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,460
I don't think they see me.

741
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:28,720
They don't hear...

742
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,420
They don't have ears.

743
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,100
They're a ghost.

744
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:34,600
Hey.

745
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:35,540
Hey.

746
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,000
Fuck you, nerd.

747
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,720
All right.

748
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,640
All right.

749
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,220
Let's get this other nerd.

750
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:54,960
Oh, no.

751
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,900
What are we talking about?

752
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,500
Oh, my God.

753
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:03,180
His friend saw.

754
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,260
His friend's like, No!

755
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,180
Charlie!

756
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,360
Get around, Charlie!

757
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,440
And I'm out of here.

758
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,760
Goodbye.

759
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,060
Just giving them some good old...

760
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,920
Stabby, stabby backshots.

761
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,440
Turn around!

762
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,960
Try to do things, Charlie!

763
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,440
Charlie, no!

764
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,900
All right.

765
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,300
I wonder if there's anything here.

766
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:35,140
Maybe.

767
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,340
Oh, nice.

768
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,020
A golden seed.

769
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:38,620
We need that.

770
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,320
Hit him, right?

771
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,560
Oh, what's this?

772
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:47,880
Liar ahead?

773
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,580
Liar ahead?

774
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,820
Oh, would this happen?

775
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:54,780
Patches?

776
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,200
If I didn't kill him?

777
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,360
Would Patches have been here?

778
00:33:59,080 --> 00:33:59,680
But...

779
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,120
Liar.

780
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:02,620
Dead.

781
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:03,520
Dead.

782
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:06,780
No?

783
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,780
Then why are people sitting lying in your head here?

784
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,460
Oh, is there a fake door?

785
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:14,360
Okay.

786
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:16,800
Hello.

787
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,420
A fake door?

788
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:20,660
Because...

789
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:21,560
Is it really?

790
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:22,920
How do I get through here?

791
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,060
Oh, my God.

792
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,680
Are you guys the liars?

793
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:29,600
Liars?

794
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:29,980
I know.

795
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,360
You guys are lying to me.

796
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:35,980
Liar ahead.

797
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,600
You are the liars.

798
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,820
I fucking knew it.

799
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,700
No item ahead.

800
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:44,420
Okay.

801
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,460
I feel like...

802
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,960
God, I don't know who are the liars.

803
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,180
Precious item ahead.

804
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,480
Precious item ahead.

805
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:55,300
Precious...

806
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:55,540
Oh, shit.

807
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,220
Okay, wait.

808
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,840
I'll add on to this.

809
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,700
Okay.

810
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,040
Where's the precious item?

811
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,940
Necessary item ahead.

812
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:10,980
We...

813
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,640
There are several liars here.

814
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:20,100
Which one is telling the truth?

815
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,700
Okay, I don't think there's an item here.

816
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:30,520
The gaslighting cycle continues.

817
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,440
Game changing.

818
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,060
You need this item to progress, guys.

819
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,720
Alright, let's go.

820
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:40,000
Wait.

821
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,560
There's so many messages here.

822
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,240
Wait.

823
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,200
There is an item here.

824
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:43,960
Wait a minute.

825
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:44,960
Wait.

826
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:45,700
There is an item.

827
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,200
Wait.

828
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,280
Oh, shit.

829
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,260
Wait a minute.

830
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,080
Wait.

831
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,000
So...

832
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,220
Look at that.

833
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,200
See, I told you.

834
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:53,800
I don't lie.

835
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:54,800
I don't...

836
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,960
I don't lie, guys.

837
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:56,660
I told you.

838
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:57,900
There is an item here.

839
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:58,800
Chat.

840
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,320
See, I told you.

841
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,040
See, I told you.

842
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,340
I'm so resourceful.

843
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,220
I'm so useful.

844
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,360
Okay.

845
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,500
I told you, guys.

846
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,500
There's an item ahead.

847
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,240
Item ahead.

848
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,360
I don't like this here.

849
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:20,860
How did he die?

850
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,460
The fuck?

851
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,520
Oh, did he, like, fuck up getting back?

852
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,380
Time for rolling?

853
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:28,840
He ahead?

854
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,900
Would this be a too high up?

855
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:33,540
Wait.

856
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,060
Am I gonna...

857
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,040
Okay.

858
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:37,660
I was gonna say.

859
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,420
How did they mess this up?

860
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,200
No door ahead.

861
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:45,560
Me too.

862
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,720
Okay, there we go.

863
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,220
In short, didn't expect good to start.

864
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,200
Oh, there's a key.

865
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:55,480
All right.

866
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:01,000
Now, all I need to do is do this because I don't trust myself.

867
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:08,600
I don't trust myself going back.

868
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:13,640
So, let me eliminate the randomness of this.

869
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,100
Oh, my God.

870
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:17,340
That bird would have killed me.

871
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,320
There we go.

872
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:22,940
All right.

873
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,180
Let's kill Charlie again.

874
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,380
Let's give him a death loop.

875
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,540
We gotta eliminate all variables.

876
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,160
Okay.

877
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,760
This sheep tried to worm into it.

878
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,580
It's like, Charlie!

879
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,120
Turn around, Charlie!

880
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:42,820
All right.

881
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,820
Let's get rid of his friend, too.

882
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,020
Oh, shit.

883
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,660
I guess we don't get rid of his friend.

884
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:48,080
Oh!

885
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:49,960
Okay.

886
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:50,660
We're fine.

887
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:53,300
We're fine.

888
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:56,580
All right.

889
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,540
Where do we go now?

890
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:58,520
Okay.

891
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:02,140
We need to try to, like, take your AirPods out.

892
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,340
I feel like I got most of...

893
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:06,660
Okay.

894
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,560
I got that one.

895
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:09,620
All right.

896
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,280
There should be some to the left, then.

897
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,420
Because I know I haven't...

898
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,360
There's, like, a couple that I haven't got yet.

899
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,360
Let's see.

900
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,400
Where are the other areas?

901
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:23,520
Huh.

902
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,860
I don't even remember how many I lit, too.

903
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:26,760
That's the worst part.

904
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:29,480
There's so...

905
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,400
This, like, area is so fucking big.

906
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:34,600
That I don't even remember where I've, like, lit...

907
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,140
Uh...

908
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,480
Where I've lit, like...

909
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:38,740
Uh...

910
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:39,120
Weren't they?

911
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:39,820
Towers?

912
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,460
I guess?

913
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,200
Where are the other shrines?

914
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,260
At least one.

915
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,080
Thank you, guys.

916
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:52,400
I'm really happy that you're here to count for me.

917
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,460
Oh, there's one over here.

918
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,120
I see one.

919
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:55,760
I think?

920
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,700
Is that one over there?

921
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,240
Oh, yeah.

922
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:58,840
Wait.

923
00:38:58,900 --> 00:38:59,440
Is that lit?

924
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,920
No, I think I lit that one.

925
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,340
No, that is unlit.

926
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,080
Okay.

927
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:05,940
Let me double check.

928
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:07,740
Oh, yeah.

929
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:08,360
No, those are...

930
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:08,700
Oh, yep.

931
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:09,260
Yep.

932
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:12,880
Whoa.

933
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,020
Whoa.

934
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:15,500
Whoa.

935
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:15,560
Whoa.

936
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:16,020
Fuck.

937
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:16,640
Oh, fuck.

938
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,660
Oh, there's so many.

939
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:18,500
Mistakes.

940
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:19,340
Mistakes.

941
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,720
I might have made a mistake.

942
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,040
But don't worry.

943
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,400
I can't summon a jellyfish.

944
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:27,980
Okay.

945
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:28,880
I worry a little bit.

946
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,480
Oh, my God.

947
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:34,380
Oh, my God.

948
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,520
Mistakes were made.

949
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,180
Mistakes were actually made.

950
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,440
Oh, my God.

951
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,920
And they can jump too.

952
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,440
Oh, my God.

953
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,100
Oh, my God.

954
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,040
It's a party.

955
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,540
We're at the party floor.

956
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:48,960
Oh, my God.

957
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:49,600
Oh, my God.

958
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,560
Oh, my God.

959
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:50,920
Wait.

960
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:53,500
Okay.

961
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,560
It's fine.

962
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,420
Things are fine.

963
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,580
Watch this.

964
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,480
I-frames.

965
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,080
Oh, thank God for iframes.

966
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:09,920
Thank God.

967
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:13,640
Okay.

968
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,560
We got saved by iframes, guys.

969
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:18,840
Oh, shit.

970
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,640
Oh, and I missed.

971
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:20,920
Oh.

972
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:26,660
Okay.

973
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,040
I should kill it.

974
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,180
All right.

975
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:29,500
We're good.

976
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,260
We're back in it.

977
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,360
We're back in it, guys.

978
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,340
I remember how to play.

979
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,340
Oh, shit.

980
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,320
Where did he come from?

981
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:36,620
Wait.

982
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:37,500
There's two of you?

983
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:40,820
Okay.

984
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:42,220
I don't know where...

985
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,240
I don't know where...

986
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,680
None of these guys came from.

987
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,960
So, there were like six of them.

988
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:47,600
In the end.

989
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:49,460
Okay.

990
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:51,400
There were apparently six of these guys.

991
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:54,620
All right.

992
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,300
So, we got one of them.

993
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:57,560
Okay.

994
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,360
We need to find another.

995
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:00,020
Okay.

996
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:00,920
He's scared.

997
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,660
He saw what I did to his friends.

998
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:03,960
That's right.

999
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:07,100
Go back and tell them what I did.

1000
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,740
That's fucking right.

1001
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:14,890
All right.

1002
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,670
So, I got another shrine here.

1003
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:18,750
Oh, hey.

1004
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:20,230
There's an entire family.

1005
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:23,150
Nice.

1006
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:27,450
There was an entire family.

1007
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:27,850
That's right.

1008
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:28,930
Roll away.

1009
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:31,270
Run away.

1010
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:36,670
We got one here.

1011
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:41,130
I know we did all the shrines on this side.

1012
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:42,650
I'm pretty sure.

1013
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:45,510
Is there like anything up on these areas?

1014
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:48,790
Okay.

1015
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:51,930
Chill, little dude.

1016
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:54,590
All right.

1017
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:58,110
Oh, shit.

1018
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:00,890
That's fucking red.

1019
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:02,530
Oh, shit.

1020
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:03,210
Oh, my God.

1021
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:03,810
You fight back.

1022
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:06,850
I only let you hit me once.

1023
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:07,450
Oh.

1024
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:09,190
That's all right.

1025
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:10,790
I'm faster than this.

1026
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:14,110
That's fucking...

1027
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:14,700
Wait, can I like...

1028
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:16,930
Oh, yeah.

1029
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:17,610
He beats me up.

1030
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:17,950
Oh.

1031
00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:18,950
I'm sorry.

1032
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:19,890
I fucking kicked him.

1033
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:20,630
Oh.

1034
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:28,590
I don't know.

1035
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:29,710
I don't know, guys.

1036
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:33,170
I thought, I thought, like, he could kick me.

1037
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:35,090
Why can't I kick him?

1038
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:37,590
I don't understand.

1039
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:38,610
That's not fair!

1040
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:42,510
Try jumping.

1041
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:43,190
Oh, here.

1042
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:45,370
I don't need to jump.

1043
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:51,150
Oh my god, he started, he started hitting my, my ass.

1044
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:52,110
It's crazy.

1045
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:53,750
Fucking freak.

1046
00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:56,110
Okay, nice.

1047
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:56,890
Golden rune.

1048
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:01,950
First off, left and up ahead.

1049
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:02,490
Oh.

1050
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:04,210
Try it down.

1051
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:07,030
Okay, I think that guy's a liar.

1052
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:11,490
Okay, he said lie.

1053
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:13,830
Left.

1054
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:17,010
Okay, I think he's also lying.

1055
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:21,970
I don't know what he meant by first off, left.

1056
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:23,050
Like, here?

1057
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:23,870
Oh!

1058
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:27,590
Okay, that's what he meant.

1059
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:31,570
Okay, nice.

1060
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:32,330
I got a feet.

1061
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:34,570
I didn't need to jump down for that.

1062
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:36,430
What the f... I could've just walked around!

1063
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:41,810
I don't believe it.

1064
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:43,270
I already have this item.

1065
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:44,430
House?

1066
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:50,430
I have an idea.

1067
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:00,300
And they'll be like...

1068
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:03,280
Oh, they're like, why is there a random house here?

1069
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:08,540
And they'll be like, oh my god.

1070
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,920
Oh, so there's a secret area with an item.

1071
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:11,880
Haha.

1072
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:13,780
Haha.

1073
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:15,960
Haha.

1074
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,780
Alan, thank you for the super chat.

1075
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:18,280
Thank you.

1076
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,060
Thank you.

1077
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:22,020
This is for backshotting Charlie.

1078
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,980
Thank you for the super chat.

1079
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:24,380
Thank you.

1080
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:25,020
Thank you.

1081
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,400
Now, they'll try to find this necessary item.

1082
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,960
For who knows how long.

1083
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,820
Like, oh, that's why there's a random empty house.

1084
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:37,580
There's an item here somewhere.

1085
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:39,560
Oh, I knew it.

1086
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:43,660
Alright.

1087
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:46,160
What do we have here?

1088
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,920
What does this lead me to?

1089
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:52,760
Hello?

1090
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:53,960
Hello?

1091
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:56,920
Oh, wait, is this the... Oh, it's the merchant.

1092
00:44:57,380 --> 00:44:57,900
Oh, my.

1093
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:00,580
Oh, this was another way to the merchant.

1094
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:01,380
I see.

1095
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:06,340
Okay.

1096
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:08,840
Alright, so there's no temple.

1097
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:09,940
There's no shrine here.

1098
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:17,630
Oh, there is an item here.

1099
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:18,110
Oh, my God.

1100
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:18,790
Wait, what the fuck?

1101
00:45:18,890 --> 00:45:19,610
Oh, I did lie.

1102
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:25,490
Wait, I have an idea.

1103
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:26,570
Oh, shit.

1104
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:28,830
No!

1105
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,160
I told you guys, I would never lie.

1106
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:37,340
Okay, wait, I have an idea.

1107
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:55,960
There we go.

1108
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:59,200
Now, no one will find this item.

1109
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:02,000
There we go.

1110
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:05,640
How could you, Toby?

1111
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:08,980
Guys, remember to upvote that one, too.

1112
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,760
Remember to downvote the...

1113
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:18,120
Downvote the item, item ahead, and then upvote, upvote the no item.

1114
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:25,900
Okay, there's nothing here, because this area is just full of ghosts.

1115
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:27,560
G-g-g-g-g-g-ghosts.

1116
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,040
Where the fuck are the other shrines?

1117
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:32,300
I'm so lost now.

1118
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:38,940
Oh, a lot of them are just picking up some plants.

1119
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,540
Just doing gardening things.

1120
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:43,400
Wait, what's over here?

1121
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:46,020
There's like a warp thing here.

1122
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:49,060
What does this warp me to?

1123
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:52,480
Weeeee!

1124
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,000
Where am I?

1125
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:01,040
I'm so high up now.

1126
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:03,720
Fuck am I?

1127
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:07,100
Oh.

1128
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,220
Oh, no.

1129
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:10,060
Oh, no.

1130
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:12,520
That's some horse parkour.

1131
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:12,860
Oh.

1132
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,780
I didn't sign up for this.

1133
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:20,200
Jesus Christ, how far is this area?

1134
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:21,100
Wait, what?

1135
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:22,960
Why do I get over here?

1136
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:25,360
Wait a minute.

1137
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,180
Oh, is this what the shrine does?

1138
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:34,890
Is that what I'm trying to do for the shrine?

1139
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:39,210
Where the fuck do I get across?

1140
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:43,890
Yeah, where's the bridge?

1141
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:49,310
Hello?

1142
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:52,790
There's like nothing here.

1143
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:55,470
Oh, check below?

1144
00:47:56,590 --> 00:47:57,550
Oh my god.

1145
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:58,990
Okay, that scared me.

1146
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:00,770
It like, bugged out visually.

1147
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:03,710
Oh, hey.

1148
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:04,690
There's an item right here.

1149
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:06,770
Oh, it's another key.

1150
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:09,810
What the fuck is he doing there?

1151
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:10,790
He's just standing there.

1152
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:11,930
What if I...

1153
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:20,380
I mean...

1154
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:21,680
Aw.

1155
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,520
Wait, I think I have enough arrows.

1156
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:25,020
Maybe.

1157
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:26,640
Oh, I do.

1158
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:28,000
Nice.

1159
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:28,420
Okay.

1160
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:36,840
Random, thank you for Magenta Super.

1161
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:37,340
Thank you.

1162
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,040
Thank you.

1163
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:40,980
Thank you for the rick roll, too.

1164
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:43,920
We're no strangers to love.

1165
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,040
You know the rules.

1166
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:47,520
And so do I.

1167
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:51,040
Oh, commitment's what I'm thinking of.

1168
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:52,240
All right.

1169
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:53,560
I'm going to use the bow.

1170
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:56,720
Oh.

1171
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:00,830
Oh.

1172
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:01,410
Oh.

1173
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:02,350
There's falloff.

1174
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:03,610
I wasn't going to hit it anyway.

1175
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:04,250
All right.

1176
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:07,350
Leaving these aura farming.

1177
00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:08,510
Never mind.

1178
00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:09,870
There was falloff, guys.

1179
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:11,230
I wasn't going to hit shit.

1180
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:18,720
Nah.

1181
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,520
Even if I, like...

1182
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:20,700
Um.

1183
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:22,340
Wait.

1184
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:23,440
Am I going to...

1185
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:26,480
TP.

1186
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:27,100
TP.

1187
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:27,820
TP.

1188
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:28,680
TP.

1189
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:29,680
TP.

1190
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:29,900
TP.

1191
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:30,520
TP.

1192
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:32,580
Am I alive?

1193
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:33,820
Oh, thank God.

1194
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:34,420
I'm alive.

1195
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:34,800
Okay.

1196
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:38,100
I got...

1197
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,340
I got a little scared.

1198
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,120
I got a little scared.

1199
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:42,240
I say.

1200
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:48,840
I have a feeling I might have fallen if I didn't do that.

1201
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:55,090
All right.

1202
00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:56,130
Was there one...

1203
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:57,570
There's a show which one I missed?

1204
00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:00,210
No, that's just a merchant.

1205
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:01,770
Oh, wait.

1206
00:50:01,830 --> 00:50:02,550
There's one over here.

1207
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:03,530
Wait.

1208
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:04,290
Is that one of them?

1209
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:05,110
I think so.

1210
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:08,570
I'm pretty sure.

1211
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:11,750
Is that a shrine?

1212
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:13,230
Oh, yeah.

1213
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:13,670
It is.

1214
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:14,290
Nice.

1215
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:18,600
Oh, he don't...

1216
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:19,140
He doesn't know.

1217
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:19,740
Ha ha ha.

1218
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:20,140
Yoink.

1219
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:21,180
Stole your shrine.

1220
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:25,620
All right.

1221
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:26,820
Oh, shit!

1222
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:28,220
Okay.

1223
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:29,140
I think he knew, guys.

1224
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:32,840
Is that the last one?

1225
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,800
I passed one on the way here?

1226
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:38,740
Oh, my God.

1227
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:39,700
That's the, like...

1228
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:42,280
That's the one where I, like, fucking passed through, like...

1229
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:43,460
Where I killed 20 of them.

1230
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:47,420
Is that the one I missed?

1231
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:48,860
Oh, hey.

1232
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:49,620
Serious.

1233
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:54,100
Oh, it'll tell me when I got all of them.

1234
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:54,460
Okay.

1235
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,400
So, I'm still missing several more.

1236
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:00,160
Yeah, fine.

1237
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:02,000
On the left.

1238
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,920
I mean, there is a bunch...

1239
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:05,520
What the fuck?

1240
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:06,500
You guys see that?

1241
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:10,420
That tree that fucking fell down.

1242
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:11,780
Okay.

1243
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:12,840
I got that one.

1244
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,020
Oh, it's from that guy.

1245
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:18,540
Okay.

1246
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:19,180
No.

1247
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,700
Like, I still don't know why my game stutters.

1248
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,500
It has something that...

1249
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:24,000
It's just...

1250
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,380
I'm building a PC port.

1251
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:26,980
And it's just PC things.

1252
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,060
So, it's like...

1253
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:30,340
It just randomly stutters, like...

1254
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:30,940
Out of nowhere.

1255
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:32,760
And I was, like, looking through the...

1256
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:33,700
Um...

1257
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:35,460
Like, things I could do to fix it.

1258
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:36,360
And, like...

1259
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:38,140
All the stuff I've currently done...

1260
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:39,340
Hasn't fixed it yet.

1261
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:45,200
I feel like I've done all this stuff on this side.

1262
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:45,680
Right?

1263
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:48,280
And I did the...

1264
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,500
Shrine on the right.

1265
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:50,660
I remember.

1266
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:54,220
Any more here that I haven't done?

1267
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:56,840
I don't think I went through...

1268
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,020
Oh, I don't think I went through...

1269
00:51:58,020 --> 00:51:58,820
Oh, there it is.

1270
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:01,120
I think that's one of them, right?

1271
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:05,870
Oh, yeah.

1272
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:06,530
There we go.

1273
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:14,210
Okay.

1274
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:15,630
Got another one.

1275
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:18,090
Have we done that area?

1276
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:24,450
Oh, nice.

1277
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:25,330
And I finally...

1278
00:52:25,330 --> 00:52:26,110
I finally...

1279
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:28,630
After I've almost finished this area...

1280
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:29,370
I found the map.

1281
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:29,910
Let's go.

1282
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:31,270
Let's fucking go.

1283
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:32,950
Wait, who's that?

1284
00:52:34,630 --> 00:52:37,090
The Hollow Worm Grounds.

1285
00:52:37,330 --> 00:52:37,910
Is that boss?

1286
00:52:38,310 --> 00:52:39,790
Oh, is that what...

1287
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:41,290
Is that what all the things...

1288
00:52:41,290 --> 00:52:43,070
Oh, I'm supposed to fight this, aren't I?

1289
00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:43,830
Later.

1290
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:47,510
That's right.

1291
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:49,370
Haha.

1292
00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:51,470
You can't do jack shit.

1293
00:52:51,930 --> 00:52:52,550
Haha.

1294
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:55,030
Because I haven't revived you yet.

1295
00:52:55,490 --> 00:52:58,710
I'm going to fucking beat up your dead body.

1296
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:01,950
This soccer feels superior.

1297
00:53:02,670 --> 00:53:03,310
That's right.

1298
00:53:03,470 --> 00:53:04,710
I'll show you.

1299
00:53:04,870 --> 00:53:06,010
That's fucking right.

1300
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:09,630
Boss defeated, guys.

1301
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:12,310
Alright.

1302
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:13,930
I found the map.

1303
00:53:15,170 --> 00:53:17,530
I wish it tells you how many...

1304
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:18,010
Like...

1305
00:53:18,010 --> 00:53:18,570
That you've lit.

1306
00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:20,710
Like, where are all the other shrines left?

1307
00:53:23,490 --> 00:53:24,890
Desecrating a corpse.

1308
00:53:26,510 --> 00:53:27,230
It's okay.

1309
00:53:27,290 --> 00:53:27,710
He's dead.

1310
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:28,510
He doesn't know.

1311
00:53:29,590 --> 00:53:31,450
Didn't expect weak foe.

1312
00:53:31,690 --> 00:53:32,830
I feel like that's lying.

1313
00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:35,470
I feel like he's lying right now.

1314
00:53:38,730 --> 00:53:39,310
Okay.

1315
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:40,510
There's more ghosts here.

1316
00:53:40,730 --> 00:53:41,590
But they don't care.

1317
00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:42,330
They're just guarding.

1318
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:44,710
What?

1319
00:53:44,990 --> 00:53:45,330
Item.

1320
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:47,130
Oh, there's so many items here.

1321
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:48,730
Leaf.

1322
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:51,330
Bird.

1323
00:53:51,630 --> 00:53:51,850
Pear.

1324
00:53:53,710 --> 00:53:54,530
Oh, this guy died.

1325
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:00,220
Okay.

1326
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:01,780
We're not going that way.

1327
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:05,400
Okay.

1328
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:06,380
We're not...

1329
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:08,120
We're not going that way, guys.

1330
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:09,860
That...

1331
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:11,620
That might be a hole that's too deep.

1332
00:54:15,630 --> 00:54:16,090
Okay.

1333
00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:16,810
Old Fang.

1334
00:54:18,870 --> 00:54:20,610
Let's go the safe way.

1335
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:21,670
Yay.

1336
00:54:23,330 --> 00:54:25,270
The non-death way.

1337
00:54:25,650 --> 00:54:26,230
Yippee.

1338
00:54:28,630 --> 00:54:32,610
Oh, there's a grace here.

1339
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:33,990
Oh, I didn't even see that.

1340
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:39,910
Alright.

1341
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:40,870
Let's grab this grace.

1342
00:54:42,050 --> 00:54:42,550
Oh, no.

1343
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:43,910
I've been to this grace before.

1344
00:54:44,310 --> 00:54:44,570
Okay.

1345
00:54:44,630 --> 00:54:45,010
Never mind.

1346
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:47,710
That's okay.

1347
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:48,610
I haven't killed anything.

1348
00:54:51,410 --> 00:54:52,370
I don't think it's this.

1349
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:52,610
Yeah.

1350
00:54:52,710 --> 00:54:53,330
This isn't it.

1351
00:54:56,110 --> 00:54:57,110
I need my arrows.

1352
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:05,170
The protector of the forest is here to punish me.

1353
00:55:08,350 --> 00:55:08,910
Okay.

1354
00:55:09,370 --> 00:55:11,110
Where is the last one?

1355
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:14,530
What's this?

1356
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:17,350
Okay.

1357
00:55:17,610 --> 00:55:18,430
I want to try this portal.

1358
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:21,710
Where does this portal take me?

1359
00:55:25,170 --> 00:55:26,610
There's so many portals.

1360
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:34,490
I killed Bambi's mom and I got punished for it.

1361
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:36,090
Oh, it's back here.

1362
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:38,990
Oh, it's this portal.

1363
00:55:39,290 --> 00:55:40,050
What the fuck?

1364
00:55:40,990 --> 00:55:41,690
Oh, okay.

1365
00:55:42,490 --> 00:55:42,890
I don't know.

1366
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:44,850
I feel like I got all the portals on this side.

1367
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:47,930
I don't know.

1368
00:55:47,990 --> 00:55:49,090
I don't know which one I'm missing.

1369
00:55:55,390 --> 00:55:56,770
Unless I didn't?

1370
00:55:57,390 --> 00:55:58,590
I have no idea.

1371
00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:02,070
I feel like I've like...

1372
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:04,390
been through this entire area already.

1373
00:56:07,390 --> 00:56:09,450
It's one between two areas.

1374
00:56:09,990 --> 00:56:11,050
Okay, let's see.

1375
00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:13,670
Like, I've...

1376
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:15,130
It has to be in the middle somewhere.

1377
00:56:15,130 --> 00:56:16,650
Because like, I went from...

1378
00:56:16,650 --> 00:56:17,610
the right side.

1379
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:19,890
I looked through everything on the right side.

1380
00:56:19,890 --> 00:56:21,430
And everything on the far left.

1381
00:56:21,970 --> 00:56:23,350
So it has to be...

1382
00:56:24,210 --> 00:56:24,690
Um...

1383
00:56:25,650 --> 00:56:26,130
Somewhere...

1384
00:56:26,130 --> 00:56:27,770
In between the middle.

1385
00:56:28,110 --> 00:56:29,110
Somewhere that I missed.

1386
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:33,210
Yeah, I got all the ones in the...

1387
00:56:33,210 --> 00:56:34,930
little holes on the left side.

1388
00:56:35,450 --> 00:56:36,830
I know that one for sure.

1389
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:43,820
Oh my god.

1390
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:44,820
This is actually the...

1391
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:46,760
It's always the last shrine that's the hardest.

1392
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:49,640
You have to retrace your steps to be like...

1393
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:51,160
Which one have I not got yet?

1394
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:52,880
Oh.

1395
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:53,800
I hit him.

1396
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:54,400
Oh!

1397
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:54,880
Shit!

1398
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:55,460
It's fine.

1399
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:56,620
Just a little arrow.

1400
00:56:57,820 --> 00:56:59,040
That's not gonna hurt anybody.

1401
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:05,000
Is there anything up here?

1402
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:06,700
Oh, I hit him.

1403
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:08,840
Nice.

1404
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:09,640
Oh, I found it!

1405
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:10,300
Wait, is that...

1406
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:11,080
Oh, there he is!

1407
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:12,000
Okay, I found it.

1408
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:12,520
Yeah!

1409
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:15,920
The last one.

1410
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:16,980
Oh!

1411
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:19,180
It's fine.

1412
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:19,700
It's fine.

1413
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:20,500
Oh my god.

1414
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:21,200
I didn't mean to...

1415
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:21,960
I didn't mean to call him.

1416
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,220
Okay, it's okay.

1417
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:25,740
They just...

1418
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:26,060
Kill themselves.

1419
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,060
Okay, that should be all of them.

1420
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:32,660
Power ga...

1421
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:34,680
Okay, now we fight the...

1422
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:35,400
Deer man.

1423
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:37,700
Wait, is that a turtle?

1424
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:41,220
Oh, look.

1425
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:41,820
It's...

1426
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:42,620
Lonely George.

1427
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:47,480
Nice.

1428
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:49,100
Don't worry.

1429
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,800
He will never have to be lonely again.

1430
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:54,400
All right.

1431
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,020
Let's go kill the deer, too.

1432
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:58,180
It's a...

1433
00:57:58,180 --> 00:57:58,640
Die.

1434
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:05,000
I'm just sparing from his misery of being alone!

1435
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:07,680
Wait, didn't Lonely George finally die?

1436
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:11,000
The famous turtle that, like...

1437
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:11,520
Uh...

1438
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:12,840
Was, like, the last of his kind?

1439
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:15,500
That was the last of his kind.

1440
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:18,960
Oh, hey, another item.

1441
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:21,000
Oh, golden room.

1442
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:21,640
We need that.

1443
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:27,370
Oh, he's still alive?

1444
00:58:27,590 --> 00:58:28,330
Holy shit.

1445
00:58:28,670 --> 00:58:30,210
How long did they get to live for?

1446
00:58:32,430 --> 00:58:33,390
Oh, there he is.

1447
00:58:33,390 --> 00:58:35,030
Yeah, he looks awfully...

1448
00:58:35,030 --> 00:58:36,790
Strong right now.

1449
00:58:37,570 --> 00:58:37,850
All right.

1450
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:49,020
There you go.

1451
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:50,120
Can't be required.

1452
00:58:56,430 --> 00:58:57,190
All right.

1453
00:58:57,970 --> 00:58:59,330
Let's fight this guy.

1454
00:59:01,790 --> 00:59:02,350
Hello!

1455
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:08,140
Time to touch your horns.

1456
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:10,800
Wait, what?

1457
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:12,200
Where am I?

1458
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:14,640
Wait, you're not the guy I'm supposed to fight?

1459
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:17,760
Oh, I don't...

1460
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,460
Oh, this is a very big game.

1461
00:59:27,050 --> 00:59:27,370
Okay.

1462
00:59:33,090 --> 00:59:34,570
Admiral, thank you for the rain.

1463
00:59:34,730 --> 00:59:34,970
Thank you.

1464
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:35,590
Thank you.

1465
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:37,390
Oh, thank you for the Akasupa.

1466
00:59:37,590 --> 00:59:37,870
Thank you.

1467
00:59:38,030 --> 00:59:38,690
Thank you.

1468
00:59:38,930 --> 00:59:39,670
Hi, Doki.

1469
00:59:39,830 --> 00:59:41,430
I'm so happy I got to meet you at Akai.

1470
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:45,630
I'm very sentimental, so even though I met you once before, it is very important to meet you again in this forum.

1471
00:59:45,850 --> 00:59:49,150
I hope you had a great time seeing all those dragons, and I hope the gifts get to you safely.

1472
00:59:49,330 --> 00:59:49,810
Thank you.

1473
00:59:49,890 --> 00:59:50,630
Thank you for Akasupa.

1474
00:59:50,730 --> 00:59:52,350
It was great meeting you, too, Ozni.

1475
00:59:52,710 --> 00:59:55,450
I hope I get your letter and the gifts as well.

1476
00:59:55,730 --> 00:59:58,470
I always love receiving letters and gifts from you guys.

1477
00:59:58,730 --> 00:59:59,670
I think whenever...

1478
00:59:59,670 --> 01:00:00,150
Oh, hey.

1479
01:00:00,310 --> 01:00:01,370
All the other messages are here.

1480
01:00:02,570 --> 01:00:02,970
Head.

1481
01:00:03,690 --> 01:00:04,090
Head.

1482
01:00:04,230 --> 01:00:04,770
Wait, what?

1483
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:06,210
Oh, pairing.

1484
01:00:06,350 --> 01:00:06,490
Okay.

1485
01:00:06,690 --> 01:00:08,190
Pairing required a head.

1486
01:00:08,410 --> 01:00:08,570
Okay.

1487
01:00:11,850 --> 01:00:12,470
That's mine.

1488
01:00:12,550 --> 01:00:12,870
Wait, no.

1489
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:13,630
That's mine.

1490
01:00:13,870 --> 01:00:14,250
Okay, wait.

1491
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:15,350
I was going to say, like, whoa.

1492
01:00:15,450 --> 01:00:16,470
So many people want head.

1493
01:00:17,050 --> 01:00:17,210
Okay.

1494
01:00:20,010 --> 01:00:20,650
Bad message.

1495
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:23,850
All right.

1496
01:00:23,890 --> 01:00:24,570
I'm a little scared.

1497
01:00:27,630 --> 01:00:29,070
Oh, there we go.

1498
01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:29,970
Oh, no.

1499
01:00:31,070 --> 01:00:32,370
It's spirited away.

1500
01:00:33,850 --> 01:00:35,550
Wait, he's just...

1501
01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:37,810
Wait, he's just walking very slowly towards me.

1502
01:00:39,450 --> 01:00:40,410
He looks...

1503
01:00:40,410 --> 01:00:41,090
Look at him.

1504
01:00:41,190 --> 01:00:41,550
Look at him.

1505
01:00:41,550 --> 01:00:42,030
He's just...

1506
01:00:42,030 --> 01:00:43,510
Look at how slow he is.

1507
01:00:43,950 --> 01:00:44,690
Look at him.

1508
01:00:44,770 --> 01:00:46,150
Look at this weak fucker.

1509
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:47,070
Look at him.

1510
01:00:47,890 --> 01:00:48,930
What is he going to do?

1511
01:00:49,290 --> 01:00:50,270
Sneeze on me?

1512
01:00:52,010 --> 01:00:52,750
Look at him.

1513
01:00:52,870 --> 01:00:53,630
Oh, shit.

1514
01:00:54,370 --> 01:00:54,950
Okay, that's fine.

1515
01:00:56,830 --> 01:00:57,450
That's right.

1516
01:00:59,070 --> 01:00:59,990
What you got to...

1517
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:00,570
Oh, my God.

1518
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:02,070
Oh, my God.

1519
01:01:02,370 --> 01:01:02,970
Okay, never mind.

1520
01:01:03,170 --> 01:01:03,470
Never mind.

1521
01:01:03,670 --> 01:01:03,990
Never mind.

1522
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:04,710
Never mind.

1523
01:01:07,750 --> 01:01:08,190
All right.

1524
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:09,510
I'm trying to get closer to him.

1525
01:01:10,070 --> 01:01:10,290
Okay.

1526
01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:12,010
I might be, like, fucking with this guy.

1527
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:13,210
Oh, shit.

1528
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:15,110
Poison him.

1529
01:01:15,310 --> 01:01:16,050
He's already dead.

1530
01:01:17,070 --> 01:01:18,610
Can you poison the dead?

1531
01:01:18,730 --> 01:01:19,650
That's a good question.

1532
01:01:22,350 --> 01:01:23,130
Oh, my God.

1533
01:01:23,290 --> 01:01:24,110
How do I...

1534
01:01:24,810 --> 01:01:25,570
You're all...

1535
01:01:25,570 --> 01:01:26,590
How do I miss that?

1536
01:01:26,670 --> 01:01:27,330
You're all there!

1537
01:01:30,470 --> 01:01:32,010
I don't fuck...

1538
01:01:32,010 --> 01:01:33,290
He's just there!

1539
01:01:33,590 --> 01:01:34,730
But you still miss?

1540
01:01:37,690 --> 01:01:38,850
Oh, my God.

1541
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:39,530
This guy.

1542
01:01:41,310 --> 01:01:41,810
I...

1543
01:01:41,810 --> 01:01:41,970
What?

1544
01:01:42,250 --> 01:01:43,130
Okay, that's...

1545
01:01:43,130 --> 01:01:43,890
Okay, that's it.

1546
01:01:44,050 --> 01:01:44,430
I'm done.

1547
01:01:44,650 --> 01:01:46,050
I'm not locking onto this guy.

1548
01:01:46,270 --> 01:01:47,230
I'm fucking...

1549
01:01:48,110 --> 01:01:48,610
I...

1550
01:01:48,610 --> 01:01:50,650
It's just legs!

1551
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:53,510
How do you just miss the legs?

1552
01:01:55,870 --> 01:01:57,690
It's literally just legs!

1553
01:02:00,210 --> 01:02:00,930
Oh, no.

1554
01:02:01,030 --> 01:02:01,970
What is the planning I'm doing?

1555
01:02:03,190 --> 01:02:04,130
I missed.

1556
01:02:04,610 --> 01:02:04,970
Wait.

1557
01:02:05,050 --> 01:02:06,250
I can poison the dead.

1558
01:02:07,130 --> 01:02:07,510
That's it.

1559
01:02:07,570 --> 01:02:08,330
I'm not locking in.

1560
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:09,190
Actually...

1561
01:02:09,190 --> 01:02:10,630
Locking in actually fucked me up.

1562
01:02:13,990 --> 01:02:14,970
Jesus Christ.

1563
01:02:15,070 --> 01:02:16,310
All he does is jump.

1564
01:02:17,330 --> 01:02:17,750
Okay.

1565
01:02:19,050 --> 01:02:19,970
Get over here.

1566
01:02:20,530 --> 01:02:21,530
Get your ass over here!

1567
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:24,910
Oh, my God.

1568
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:26,710
He's still fucking trying to fly.

1569
01:02:31,630 --> 01:02:32,110
Oh!

1570
01:02:32,350 --> 01:02:33,430
Okay, that does nothing.

1571
01:02:33,590 --> 01:02:33,970
That's fine.

1572
01:02:34,130 --> 01:02:34,490
That's fine.

1573
01:02:34,670 --> 01:02:35,610
That does nothing.

1574
01:02:37,850 --> 01:02:38,510
That's fine.

1575
01:02:38,710 --> 01:02:39,750
That does nothing.

1576
01:02:40,450 --> 01:02:40,930
Please.

1577
01:02:41,270 --> 01:02:41,590
The block.

1578
01:02:41,790 --> 01:02:44,370
I need you to stay on the ground so I can actually...

1579
01:02:44,370 --> 01:02:46,550
Chop your fucking legs off!

1580
01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:51,420
I can't.

1581
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:52,520
I fucking can't.

1582
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:54,260
I can't with this goddamn deer.

1583
01:02:59,730 --> 01:03:00,450
All right.

1584
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:06,430
Also, there was a really good Elden Ring video that showed up in my recommended.

1585
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:10,610
And it was like 50 skeletons versus like all the Elden Ring boss.

1586
01:03:11,050 --> 01:03:12,990
And there was...

1587
01:03:12,990 --> 01:03:18,550
There was one moment there that it was just like one skeleton versus a giant fucking dragon.

1588
01:03:18,590 --> 01:03:20,210
And it was literally like one hit.

1589
01:03:20,810 --> 01:03:21,690
Oh, and I did it!

1590
01:03:24,890 --> 01:03:25,450
Yay!

1591
01:03:25,870 --> 01:03:26,090
Yay!

1592
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:29,810
That's my 50 skeletons.

1593
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:32,010
Oh, that video was so sick.

1594
01:03:32,590 --> 01:03:33,490
You just get to know.

1595
01:03:34,030 --> 01:03:38,710
It ended up being like one skeleton versus like one giant dragon.

1596
01:03:38,930 --> 01:03:42,090
And then like the fight lasted for like two minutes or something.

1597
01:03:44,790 --> 01:03:46,250
Be wary of tranquility.

1598
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:47,810
Wait, where do I go from here?

1599
01:03:50,010 --> 01:03:50,770
Wait, what?

1600
01:03:50,890 --> 01:03:51,490
What the fuck?

1601
01:03:51,530 --> 01:03:52,690
Where the fuck do I go?

1602
01:03:54,850 --> 01:03:56,010
Is there any items here?

1603
01:03:56,090 --> 01:03:57,450
I did it.

1604
01:03:57,610 --> 01:03:57,690
I did it.

1605
01:03:57,690 --> 01:03:58,430
And then beautiful.

1606
01:04:01,510 --> 01:04:03,330
Message of praise, strat.

1607
01:04:03,770 --> 01:04:05,090
Let me your strength.

1608
01:04:05,330 --> 01:04:07,370
Put your hands in the air, dragons.

1609
01:04:09,030 --> 01:04:10,270
Message of praise.

1610
01:04:12,270 --> 01:04:13,750
Toby, thank you for the super chat.

1611
01:04:13,870 --> 01:04:14,070
Thank you.

1612
01:04:14,330 --> 01:04:14,750
Thank you.

1613
01:04:15,110 --> 01:04:15,850
Is there a great...

1614
01:04:15,850 --> 01:04:17,550
Anything like around here?

1615
01:04:18,690 --> 01:04:21,330
Oh, I can't even ride my fucking horse.

1616
01:04:24,650 --> 01:04:26,310
Guess I just walk back.

1617
01:04:28,650 --> 01:04:30,090
The spirit bomb.

1618
01:04:31,990 --> 01:04:32,810
Oh, wait.

1619
01:04:32,890 --> 01:04:34,290
Oh, and those are more messages.

1620
01:04:35,910 --> 01:04:37,070
Ah, bliss.

1621
01:04:39,830 --> 01:04:41,970
Alright, I guess I just walk back.

1622
01:04:42,850 --> 01:04:44,410
I keep thinking they're items.

1623
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:48,610
Oh, just TP out.

1624
01:04:48,710 --> 01:04:48,930
Alright.

1625
01:04:50,590 --> 01:04:51,810
Wait, so that's it?

1626
01:04:53,770 --> 01:04:55,750
Do I get anything special out of that?

1627
01:05:01,730 --> 01:05:02,410
That's it?

1628
01:05:02,830 --> 01:05:04,130
Does it not give me anything?

1629
01:05:06,310 --> 01:05:07,130
What the fuck?

1630
01:05:07,290 --> 01:05:08,110
What was the point?

1631
01:05:10,370 --> 01:05:11,890
Oh, I just get a new summon?

1632
01:05:12,170 --> 01:05:13,150
God damn it.

1633
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:16,270
I thought I'd get something more out of it.

1634
01:05:17,030 --> 01:05:18,130
Okay, can I...

1635
01:05:19,130 --> 01:05:20,150
Show above ground.

1636
01:05:20,330 --> 01:05:20,970
Okay, there it is.

1637
01:05:21,330 --> 01:05:22,490
Alright, I think I can...

1638
01:05:22,490 --> 01:05:24,090
I think I can upgrade the jellyfish.

1639
01:05:24,810 --> 01:05:26,610
Adjust the gill of killing...

1640
01:05:26,610 --> 01:05:27,410
Um...

1641
01:05:27,410 --> 01:05:28,070
A forest...

1642
01:05:28,070 --> 01:05:29,410
A forestry ancestor.

1643
01:05:31,410 --> 01:05:31,930
Yay!

1644
01:05:33,790 --> 01:05:35,550
It's just like spirited away.

1645
01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:38,570
Alright.

1646
01:05:39,090 --> 01:05:41,090
Oh, I need number five.

1647
01:05:41,090 --> 01:05:42,510
I got a lot of threes.

1648
01:05:44,110 --> 01:05:45,570
Wait, there's something you should know?

1649
01:05:46,270 --> 01:05:46,990
What is it?

1650
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:47,830
Even I don't know.

1651
01:05:47,850 --> 01:05:48,730
I told you about something.

1652
01:05:49,050 --> 01:05:54,270
A little while ago, someone started lurking in the wing on the opposite side of the round table.

1653
01:05:54,690 --> 01:06:02,410
And I can hear, from all the way over there, the howling and wailing of spirits in fear of a curse.

1654
01:06:03,670 --> 01:06:07,150
I can even hear the repulsive, twisted malice in itself.

1655
01:06:07,910 --> 01:06:11,670
A plethora of spirits in an unceasing cacophony.

1656
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:13,430
Wait, who is she talking to?

1657
01:06:13,550 --> 01:06:14,890
Bro, he's like right here.

1658
01:06:14,890 --> 01:06:18,830
How much suffering inflicted to who knows how many souls.

1659
01:06:19,230 --> 01:06:22,310
Not even the grafting caused anything like this to happen.

1660
01:06:22,570 --> 01:06:24,050
Bro, he's like right here.

1661
01:06:24,970 --> 01:06:27,070
I know you're strong, but please.

1662
01:06:30,210 --> 01:06:31,530
That's so fucked up.

1663
01:06:31,790 --> 01:06:34,390
She's like saying all that while he's like in the next room.

1664
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:35,210
I'll watch you for dead.

1665
01:06:35,790 --> 01:06:37,490
No matter, it's all the same.

1666
01:06:38,150 --> 01:06:38,330
Lay out your own...

1667
01:06:38,330 --> 01:06:40,130
Yeah, I know it's not him, but there's someone here.

1668
01:06:41,110 --> 01:06:42,390
Ooh, I can upgrade this.

1669
01:06:47,610 --> 01:06:50,130
I need smithing stone three.

1670
01:06:50,370 --> 01:06:51,390
More smithing stone three.

1671
01:06:51,610 --> 01:06:51,750
Okay.

1672
01:06:53,350 --> 01:06:55,390
Yeah, I know he's not talking about the smithies.

1673
01:06:55,390 --> 01:06:57,990
Like, she was saying someone on this side.

1674
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:02,860
Is it here?

1675
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:05,500
Oh, is it this one?

1676
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:06,580
Is it this guy?

1677
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:09,780
You've received the wisdom of the two fingers, have you not?

1678
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:10,180
Yeah.

1679
01:07:10,540 --> 01:07:11,800
Then I bid you welcome.

1680
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:14,580
As a true member of the round table.

1681
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:17,280
I am known as Gideon Ofnir.

1682
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:21,940
As a tarnished who wishes to stand before the Elden Ring and become Elden Lord.

1683
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:24,780
I am accumulating knowledge.

1684
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:27,420
Bro, you still haven't become the Elden Lord yet?

1685
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:30,040
Maybe just get good.

1686
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:32,500
Actual skill diff.

1687
01:07:37,430 --> 01:07:37,890
Alright.

1688
01:07:38,070 --> 01:07:38,750
Oh, it's not here?

1689
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:39,870
It's at the end of this hall?

1690
01:07:41,230 --> 01:07:41,690
What?

1691
01:07:44,350 --> 01:07:45,570
What's he talking to?

1692
01:07:45,890 --> 01:07:47,030
Oh, it's at the end of this hall?

1693
01:07:47,250 --> 01:07:48,010
Oh, this guy?

1694
01:07:48,290 --> 01:07:49,150
What's wrong with him?

1695
01:07:50,190 --> 01:07:51,010
Wait, he's red.

1696
01:07:52,230 --> 01:07:53,250
Why are you red?

1697
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:02,910
He's a sick bastard?

1698
01:08:18,050 --> 01:08:19,610
Women hate you.

1699
01:08:19,950 --> 01:08:20,510
Why?

1700
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:21,490
What did you do?

1701
01:08:21,490 --> 01:08:22,870
Apparently not.

1702
01:08:23,830 --> 01:08:25,090
You are but a lamb.

1703
01:08:25,990 --> 01:08:28,170
A strange is a defilement.

1704
01:08:28,730 --> 01:08:30,530
Ignorant of your own ignorance.

1705
01:08:31,330 --> 01:08:33,130
You no longer interest me.

1706
01:08:33,810 --> 01:08:35,890
I've been long without peace.

1707
01:08:37,190 --> 01:08:39,190
He's on the list?

1708
01:08:39,390 --> 01:08:40,290
Which one?

1709
01:08:43,030 --> 01:08:44,910
He eats shit?

1710
01:08:45,370 --> 01:08:48,910
Okay, I don't need a shit eater to tell me my worth.

1711
01:08:48,910 --> 01:08:56,510
I don't need some caca enjoyer to say that I'm not worth his time.

1712
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:02,350
Alright.

1713
01:09:02,710 --> 01:09:03,690
All of them.

1714
01:09:03,870 --> 01:09:05,710
He wrote the list.

1715
01:09:05,870 --> 01:09:08,810
He is the reason why the lists were created.

1716
01:09:11,090 --> 01:09:13,050
Alright, let's talk to the two toes.

1717
01:09:18,730 --> 01:09:20,130
Is there anything good?

1718
01:09:20,130 --> 01:09:22,010
Aw, they're all like...

1719
01:09:22,010 --> 01:09:23,170
I guess like...

1720
01:09:23,170 --> 01:09:24,070
Maybe the bow?

1721
01:09:24,830 --> 01:09:25,950
Should I grab the bow?

1722
01:09:27,310 --> 01:09:29,250
I don't feel like I never really used it.

1723
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:37,420
Do I get the bow?

1724
01:09:37,660 --> 01:09:38,160
Or nah?

1725
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:40,640
Oh, I need strength for that?

1726
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:41,040
Okay.

1727
01:09:43,660 --> 01:09:44,580
I can wait.

1728
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:44,900
Okay.

1729
01:09:45,140 --> 01:09:45,840
I'll just wait then.

1730
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:52,180
Alright, someone said I should go back to where I killed the magma worm.

1731
01:09:52,180 --> 01:09:53,600
So I guess it's...

1732
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:54,100
Here?

1733
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:55,780
The magma worm.

1734
01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:03,130
Hey, this is...

1735
01:10:03,130 --> 01:10:05,050
This is chat's build, okay?

1736
01:10:05,730 --> 01:10:06,970
If you're gonna...

1737
01:10:06,970 --> 01:10:10,250
If you're gonna say set the dex nerd, that's you too.

1738
01:10:10,830 --> 01:10:12,610
Chat decided this build.

1739
01:10:15,650 --> 01:10:17,470
You think I have free...

1740
01:10:31,550 --> 01:10:33,090
Okay, let me grab my...

1741
01:10:33,090 --> 01:10:34,810
Let me grab...

1742
01:10:34,810 --> 01:10:39,210
I told you guys...

1743
01:10:39,210 --> 01:10:40,890
You think I have free will?

1744
01:10:41,410 --> 01:10:42,170
I would...

1745
01:10:42,170 --> 01:10:43,690
If chat didn't...

1746
01:10:43,690 --> 01:10:46,670
Chat didn't tell me there was no elevator.

1747
01:10:46,670 --> 01:10:48,570
So I went through...

1748
01:10:48,570 --> 01:10:51,050
Okay, yes I think you are free.

1749
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:53,610
And then thank you for the super chat.

1750
01:10:53,830 --> 01:10:54,950
Thank you, thank you.

1751
01:10:59,290 --> 01:11:00,530
Alright, down.

1752
01:11:14,610 --> 01:11:17,050
Try jumping right here.

1753
01:11:18,570 --> 01:11:20,890
Was that chat's fault too?

1754
01:11:21,410 --> 01:11:23,450
Tuck, thank you for the super chat.

1755
01:11:23,610 --> 01:11:24,530
Thank you, thank you.

1756
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:27,410
Yes, because you didn't tell me there was a hole there.

1757
01:11:27,550 --> 01:11:29,030
You know I don't have free will.

1758
01:11:30,570 --> 01:11:31,610
Magenta wasted.

1759
01:11:31,790 --> 01:11:33,030
Look, that's not true!

1760
01:11:33,390 --> 01:11:34,210
It wasn't a cliff!

1761
01:11:34,510 --> 01:11:36,470
You didn't say anything about a hole!

1762
01:11:36,790 --> 01:11:38,710
You only said that it was a cliff!

1763
01:11:39,330 --> 01:11:41,410
Guys, thank you for the super chat.

1764
01:11:41,550 --> 01:11:42,670
Thank you, thank you.

1765
01:11:46,310 --> 01:11:48,030
Alright, let's go back up.

1766
01:11:48,370 --> 01:11:51,190
Okay, now that I'm here, where do I go?

1767
01:11:53,670 --> 01:11:55,650
Someone said I should be here.

1768
01:11:58,390 --> 01:12:00,250
It's like above, maybe?

1769
01:12:00,430 --> 01:12:01,790
Oh wait, there's something behind me.

1770
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:08,260
Beware of just getting started.

1771
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:09,300
Ah, surface.

1772
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:11,460
Zyka, thank you for the super chat.

1773
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:12,680
Thank you, thank you.

1774
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:15,220
I remember Demon Slithering was strength build.

1775
01:12:15,380 --> 01:12:15,880
What happened?

1776
01:12:16,140 --> 01:12:17,280
That was your build too!

1777
01:12:17,420 --> 01:12:18,860
You guys made that build!

1778
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:22,540
I guess for this game, it's more about dexterity?

1779
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:25,060
Oh, I remember.

1780
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:26,160
I tried to kill that guy.

1781
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:28,380
No, okay, I went up here first.

1782
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:29,240
I remember now.

1783
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:30,860
Because I like, ignore that guy.

1784
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:32,340
Oh, and then there were these!

1785
01:12:32,660 --> 01:12:33,700
Okay, I remember now.

1786
01:12:33,700 --> 01:12:35,220
I remember.

1787
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:36,760
Okay.

1788
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:38,700
Let's see.

1789
01:12:39,140 --> 01:12:41,600
Let's grab my horse real fast.

1790
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:45,600
Yeah, because, like, lead is good for this game.

1791
01:12:50,590 --> 01:12:50,970
Okay.

1792
01:12:52,530 --> 01:12:53,250
No, no!

1793
01:12:53,550 --> 01:12:54,030
Okay, okay.

1794
01:12:55,710 --> 01:12:56,710
Oh, that was scary.

1795
01:13:00,370 --> 01:13:02,850
No, I said, which build should I do?

1796
01:13:02,990 --> 01:13:04,630
And you guys were like, Katana!

1797
01:13:04,950 --> 01:13:05,830
And I was like, okay.

1798
01:13:06,910 --> 01:13:08,150
Alan, thank you for the super chat.

1799
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:08,510
Thank you.

1800
01:13:08,670 --> 01:13:09,130
Thank you.

1801
01:13:10,310 --> 01:13:10,890
Oh, shit.

1802
01:13:11,250 --> 01:13:11,690
Oh, shit.

1803
01:13:12,910 --> 01:13:13,250
Bye.

1804
01:13:13,990 --> 01:13:14,950
Are these bad people?

1805
01:13:16,950 --> 01:13:17,930
What is he?

1806
01:13:18,430 --> 01:13:18,530
What is he?

1807
01:13:20,230 --> 01:13:21,550
He didn't seem that bad.

1808
01:13:24,830 --> 01:13:26,210
What did you throw at me?

1809
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:28,550
What the fuck did you throw at me?

1810
01:13:28,750 --> 01:13:29,470
Give me your shit.

1811
01:13:29,750 --> 01:13:30,830
Oh, perfumer.

1812
01:13:35,270 --> 01:13:36,950
He threw like, he was like, Pakistan!

1813
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:40,310
And I just, like, walked to the left.

1814
01:13:43,490 --> 01:13:44,750
Oh, what's down here?

1815
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:51,380
I'm gonna go downstairs.

1816
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:57,760
It's down over here.

1817
01:13:58,680 --> 01:13:59,120
Yeah.

1818
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:00,460
Oh, is that a catacomb?

1819
01:14:00,620 --> 01:14:01,020
Nice.

1820
01:14:02,180 --> 01:14:03,360
We need that.

1821
01:14:05,980 --> 01:14:08,580
No pressure, therefore think carefully.

1822
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:12,000
But...

1823
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,960
I can't even access this.

1824
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:14,720
Oh!

1825
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:16,020
It's a key!

1826
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:17,120
A stone...

1827
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:18,560
Is it worth it?

1828
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:19,140
Fuck it.

1829
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:20,700
Let's go.

1830
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:23,140
I have so many stone keys anyway.

1831
01:14:31,650 --> 01:14:33,170
Let me in!

1832
01:14:33,790 --> 01:14:35,930
God said, let her in!

1833
01:14:40,740 --> 01:14:41,180
Alright.

1834
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:44,140
Wait, I think I can...

1835
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:44,860
Oh, I can level up.

1836
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:47,280
Do I do more vigor, guys?

1837
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:49,100
Or do I do...

1838
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:50,540
Oh, wait.

1839
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:51,080
No, I don't.

1840
01:14:51,140 --> 01:14:51,460
Wait, actually.

1841
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:54,000
I'm, like, missing, like, a hundred or some shit.

1842
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:55,040
But I have...

1843
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:56,500
I just have...

1844
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:56,740
Yeah.

1845
01:14:56,740 --> 01:14:57,820
I can just use this.

1846
01:15:00,260 --> 01:15:01,020
Is it 40?

1847
01:15:01,380 --> 01:15:01,660
Okay.

1848
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:04,380
I'll get it to 40.

1849
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:07,360
Alright.

1850
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:08,760
And now...

1851
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:11,280
Now you guys have to help me figure out what to do next, after that.

1852
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:17,320
See you...

1853
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:21,560
That's fucking...

1854
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:21,880
Oh!

1855
01:15:22,180 --> 01:15:22,420
Why?

1856
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:23,100
I didn't see you!

1857
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:23,180
No!

1858
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:27,140
Okay.

1859
01:15:27,740 --> 01:15:29,020
I saw that guy, though.

1860
01:15:32,910 --> 01:15:34,410
No hidden path?

1861
01:15:34,730 --> 01:15:34,910
Oh.

1862
01:15:35,390 --> 01:15:35,950
This.

1863
01:15:37,570 --> 01:15:38,250
Surprise!

1864
01:15:39,970 --> 01:15:41,330
First off...

1865
01:15:41,330 --> 01:15:43,010
By the way, try critical hit?

1866
01:15:45,390 --> 01:15:46,570
Oh, these guys?

1867
01:15:52,570 --> 01:15:53,510
Oh, my God.

1868
01:15:53,770 --> 01:15:55,630
Oh, my God.

1869
01:15:55,810 --> 01:15:57,010
Oh, my God.

1870
01:15:57,010 --> 01:15:57,090
Oh, my God.

1871
01:15:57,230 --> 01:15:57,350
Oh, my God.

1872
01:15:57,410 --> 01:15:58,590
These guys are tanky as hell.

1873
01:16:01,210 --> 01:16:02,010
Holy shit.

1874
01:16:03,890 --> 01:16:05,750
Oh, they hit so strong.

1875
01:16:06,870 --> 01:16:07,350
Alright.

1876
01:16:07,430 --> 01:16:10,370
Now I understand why they're, like, do it one by one.

1877
01:16:12,190 --> 01:16:12,670
No.

1878
01:16:12,910 --> 01:16:13,410
Oh, thank God.

1879
01:16:15,910 --> 01:16:16,510
Okay.

1880
01:16:16,510 --> 01:16:16,830
Oh, shit!

1881
01:16:19,790 --> 01:16:20,390
Okay.

1882
01:16:20,610 --> 01:16:21,530
Doesn't know where I am.

1883
01:16:23,650 --> 01:16:24,490
Holy shit.

1884
01:16:24,610 --> 01:16:26,590
These guys are so fucking tanky.

1885
01:16:30,890 --> 01:16:31,790
Oh, nice.

1886
01:16:32,190 --> 01:16:32,610
Flower.

1887
01:16:33,990 --> 01:16:34,690
Needed that.

1888
01:16:35,430 --> 01:16:36,250
Level five.

1889
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:36,790
Was that...

1890
01:16:37,730 --> 01:16:39,290
Was level five the one we needed?

1891
01:16:39,630 --> 01:16:40,650
For the jellyfish?

1892
01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:41,930
Liar.

1893
01:16:46,170 --> 01:16:46,850
Oh.

1894
01:16:47,370 --> 01:16:47,910
That's a cliff.

1895
01:16:48,110 --> 01:16:48,310
Oh!

1896
01:16:49,370 --> 01:16:49,910
Ha-ha!

1897
01:16:50,590 --> 01:16:51,550
Jump too early!

1898
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:52,930
Idiot!

1899
01:16:53,630 --> 01:16:54,270
That's right!

1900
01:16:55,010 --> 01:16:56,330
Jump too early!

1901
01:16:56,610 --> 01:16:57,650
You know I'm slow!

1902
01:16:59,650 --> 01:17:01,010
I didn't path ahead.

1903
01:17:07,890 --> 01:17:09,270
Oh, like here?

1904
01:17:09,510 --> 01:17:09,690
Oh!

1905
01:17:09,990 --> 01:17:10,310
Here!

1906
01:17:11,230 --> 01:17:11,750
Down.

1907
01:17:12,270 --> 01:17:12,730
Level.

1908
01:17:15,850 --> 01:17:16,850
Do I live?

1909
01:17:19,210 --> 01:17:21,210
I like how he's, like, pointing down!

1910
01:17:22,910 --> 01:17:23,910
He's like...

1911
01:17:23,910 --> 01:17:24,570
I don't know.

1912
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:26,390
So I'm just gonna put...

1913
01:17:26,390 --> 01:17:27,850
I'm gonna try jumping.

1914
01:17:30,350 --> 01:17:32,530
I won't do it myself, but...

1915
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:38,520
Try jumping.

1916
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:43,560
I don't trust him, but...

1917
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:44,760
Maybe someone else will.

1918
01:17:46,460 --> 01:17:47,260
Dog ahead.

1919
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:49,020
Oh my God, there's the dogs.

1920
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:56,560
Alright.

1921
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:02,680
Oh...

1922
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:03,780
My...

1923
01:18:03,780 --> 01:18:05,000
He lives?

1924
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:07,000
Okay.

1925
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:09,760
Oh, he just went back to sleep.

1926
01:18:11,700 --> 01:18:12,800
Do you think he knows?

1927
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:14,800
Oh!

1928
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:17,960
Oh, rolling, I'm rolling.

1929
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:21,160
Do you think he knows that his dog's dead?

1930
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:23,980
Do you think he's mad?

1931
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:28,500
Oh my God, he's just rolling!

1932
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:32,940
Oh, nice.

1933
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:33,560
I got the bleed.

1934
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:35,440
There you go.

1935
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:38,840
Okay, he didn't really care that much.

1936
01:18:38,860 --> 01:18:39,540
That's fucked up.

1937
01:18:40,460 --> 01:18:43,560
He, like, went back to sleep after, like...

1938
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:45,200
After, like, I arrowed his dog.

1939
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:47,700
Why is it always lying?

1940
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:48,580
Why is it always lying?

1941
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,180
Why is it always lying?

1942
01:18:52,180 --> 01:18:56,800
Why are there so many lies in this, in this catacomb?

1943
01:18:58,280 --> 01:18:59,680
Liar ahead.

1944
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:00,120
Where?

1945
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:00,660
Oh!

1946
01:19:04,390 --> 01:19:04,830
Oh!

1947
01:19:04,830 --> 01:19:06,370
Oh my God, it's so dark, too.

1948
01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:12,860
If only I have a lever, likely down.

1949
01:19:17,020 --> 01:19:18,080
Oh, there's a lot.

1950
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:19,880
Okay, let's kill this guy first.

1951
01:19:19,940 --> 01:19:20,920
Because I feel like...

1952
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:24,340
I'll be too busy erroring things, and I won't see him.

1953
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:27,620
Okay, nice.

1954
01:19:28,380 --> 01:19:28,900
Okay.

1955
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:29,680
Ooh!

1956
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:31,040
Wait, what the fuck was that?

1957
01:19:32,580 --> 01:19:33,940
Why was that blue?

1958
01:19:34,540 --> 01:19:35,520
That's so cool.

1959
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:38,320
What does the blue mean?

1960
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:40,800
I forgot I have a lantern.

1961
01:19:41,940 --> 01:19:42,780
Oh my God, you're right.

1962
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:49,880
Alright, uh...

1963
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:53,800
Woop!

1964
01:19:55,740 --> 01:19:56,340
Woop!

1965
01:19:58,100 --> 01:19:58,700
Woop!

1966
01:19:58,900 --> 01:20:00,620
Oh, it's my talisman!

1967
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:05,100
Okay, I think I can craft, like, a few more.

1968
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:06,780
Oh no, I have bone arrows.

1969
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:07,660
Nice, okay.

1970
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:11,780
Oh, never mind.

1971
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:14,780
Never mind.

1972
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:16,040
We shouldn't use those.

1973
01:20:16,740 --> 01:20:17,260
Uh...

1974
01:20:17,260 --> 01:20:18,640
I think I have enough to craft.

1975
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:19,640
Yeah, I do.

1976
01:20:19,980 --> 01:20:20,600
Okay, nice.

1977
01:20:23,180 --> 01:20:23,700
Woop!

1978
01:20:25,660 --> 01:20:26,180
Woop!

1979
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:28,640
Woop!

1980
01:20:28,900 --> 01:20:30,000
Heh heh heh.

1981
01:20:30,100 --> 01:20:31,980
Can't do anything about it, bitch!

1982
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:34,160
Oh wait, what the fuck?

1983
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:35,060
How are you still alive?

1984
01:20:36,140 --> 01:20:36,560
Woop!

1985
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:40,340
Alright, uh...

1986
01:20:40,340 --> 01:20:41,040
Alright, we'll do...

1987
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:41,680
Kill one more.

1988
01:20:43,180 --> 01:20:43,600
Poke.

1989
01:20:45,020 --> 01:20:45,540
Poke.

1990
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:47,820
Poke.

1991
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:51,260
Yeah, that's right.

1992
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:53,840
Stand there, take the arrow!

1993
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:54,920
Oh, wait.

1994
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:56,180
Let me make one more.

1995
01:20:58,900 --> 01:20:59,600
Oh, I can't.

1996
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:01,720
Uh...

1997
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:02,940
I'll get you next time.

1998
01:21:05,860 --> 01:21:08,180
I'll kill you when I make it back down.

1999
01:21:10,820 --> 01:21:11,420
Alright.

2000
01:21:13,820 --> 01:21:15,060
Oh, that's awkward.

2001
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:18,780
Ambush ahead, be wary of up.

2002
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:27,720
Where are they?

2003
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:30,420
Where are they?

2004
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:35,240
What?

2005
01:21:39,290 --> 01:21:39,770
Oh!

2006
01:21:40,510 --> 01:21:41,530
Oh, there he is.

2007
01:21:43,750 --> 01:21:45,030
I was like, where are they?

2008
01:21:45,990 --> 01:21:47,590
Oh, I can make fledged arrows.

2009
01:21:47,710 --> 01:21:48,110
What the fuck?

2010
01:21:48,110 --> 01:21:49,590
I could've made this the entire time.

2011
01:21:51,690 --> 01:21:52,650
Are they better?

2012
01:21:54,970 --> 01:21:56,910
I don't even know they're supposed to be better.

2013
01:21:57,210 --> 01:21:57,470
Hi.

2014
01:21:57,810 --> 01:21:58,290
Hi there.

2015
01:22:04,300 --> 01:22:04,780
Alright.

2016
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:06,920
Alright.

2017
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:08,060
Alright, let me...

2018
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:10,740
Let me see.

2019
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:13,860
Hello.

2020
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:20,780
Okay, that did like nothing.

2021
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:21,980
Ha ha!

2022
01:22:22,340 --> 01:22:22,800
Whoa!

2023
01:22:25,980 --> 01:22:26,940
Oh my god!

2024
01:22:27,180 --> 01:22:28,560
Oh my god!

2025
01:22:28,780 --> 01:22:29,480
Oh my god!

2026
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:30,240
You do stuff.

2027
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:30,560
Okay.

2028
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:38,140
Oh, he's trying to get me!

2029
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:39,420
Holy shit!

2030
01:22:40,220 --> 01:22:40,580
That's right!

2031
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:42,040
Get fledged!

2032
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:43,500
That's fucking right!

2033
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:44,740
Get out of here!

2034
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:49,520
Alright, that was not as scary as I thought it was gonna be.

2035
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:50,120
Thank god.

2036
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:52,820
Ah, Ness.

2037
01:22:54,020 --> 01:22:54,820
Liar ahead.

2038
01:22:55,180 --> 01:22:56,940
How many liars are here?

2039
01:22:59,780 --> 01:23:00,580
Everybody!

2040
01:23:00,660 --> 01:23:00,860
Everybody!

2041
01:23:00,860 --> 01:23:02,460
At this point, everybody's a liar!

2042
01:23:02,860 --> 01:23:03,600
It left.

2043
01:23:04,540 --> 01:23:05,940
Oh my god, dude.

2044
01:23:06,540 --> 01:23:07,580
They're all liars.

2045
01:23:08,020 --> 01:23:09,320
Every single one of you.

2046
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:13,300
Right?

2047
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:18,440
Okay, wait.

2048
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:25,160
Alright.

2049
01:23:27,900 --> 01:23:28,700
Behold.

2050
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:35,320
Up.

2051
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,580
Left, right, up.

2052
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:44,140
Which is the right path.

2053
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:48,700
Alright, I guess I have to go down then.

2054
01:23:51,420 --> 01:23:52,840
Enchonk, thank you for the raid!

2055
01:23:53,160 --> 01:23:54,240
I hope you had a great stream!

2056
01:23:59,350 --> 01:24:01,730
Oh, we will kill him.

2057
01:24:05,270 --> 01:24:07,150
And then, we'll get this guy.

2058
01:24:07,770 --> 01:24:08,530
That's right.

2059
01:24:08,670 --> 01:24:09,530
Get out of here!

2060
01:24:09,930 --> 01:24:10,650
Holy shit!

2061
01:24:10,750 --> 01:24:12,450
I just realized it's so far.

2062
01:24:12,750 --> 01:24:13,510
Like the...

2063
01:24:14,490 --> 01:24:15,370
Oh, nice.

2064
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:17,610
The...

2065
01:24:18,510 --> 01:24:19,910
The gate with the boss gate.

2066
01:24:20,550 --> 01:24:22,750
So I can like cheese it and go back.

2067
01:24:28,110 --> 01:24:29,690
And then there's the stairs.

2068
01:24:33,550 --> 01:24:33,870
Oh.

2069
01:24:34,050 --> 01:24:34,570
Okay, nice.

2070
01:24:37,850 --> 01:24:38,310
That's true.

2071
01:24:38,410 --> 01:24:39,230
I could always just run.

2072
01:24:39,390 --> 01:24:41,850
But I feel like I'm gonna get hit by everything if I do that.

2073
01:24:46,170 --> 01:24:46,510
Cool.

2074
01:24:47,570 --> 01:24:49,010
What are all these free items?

2075
01:24:51,770 --> 01:24:53,190
Alright, now we can drop down.

2076
01:24:54,470 --> 01:24:54,850
Alright.

2077
01:24:55,290 --> 01:24:56,530
That's how you get the lever.

2078
01:24:56,730 --> 01:24:58,330
Alright, how hard is this boss chat?

2079
01:25:02,530 --> 01:25:03,850
How hard is he?

2080
01:25:04,170 --> 01:25:04,930
Alright, let's see.

2081
01:25:05,230 --> 01:25:06,470
Be wary of group.

2082
01:25:06,770 --> 01:25:06,870
Oh.

2083
01:25:07,950 --> 01:25:10,530
I didn't expect we...

2084
01:25:10,530 --> 01:25:11,170
Oh.

2085
01:25:11,990 --> 01:25:12,050
Oh.

2086
01:25:12,870 --> 01:25:13,370
Okay.

2087
01:25:13,670 --> 01:25:14,230
Apparently.

2088
01:25:14,750 --> 01:25:14,930
Okay.

2089
01:25:14,970 --> 01:25:17,170
How did you die outside of the gate?

2090
01:25:17,610 --> 01:25:18,010
What?

2091
01:25:20,410 --> 01:25:21,010
Alright.

2092
01:25:22,890 --> 01:25:24,290
Oh, there's two of them.

2093
01:25:24,710 --> 01:25:25,070
Wait.

2094
01:25:25,130 --> 01:25:25,830
I don't have XP.

2095
01:25:26,030 --> 01:25:26,770
Oh my god!

2096
01:25:26,930 --> 01:25:27,830
I don't have jellyfish!

2097
01:25:27,830 --> 01:25:29,190
Oh, it's him!

2098
01:25:29,330 --> 01:25:30,150
It's Perfume Man!

2099
01:25:30,590 --> 01:25:31,390
Oh no!

2100
01:25:31,970 --> 01:25:32,410
Oh no!

2101
01:25:33,130 --> 01:25:33,550
Wait!

2102
01:25:33,670 --> 01:25:35,110
He has shield?!

2103
01:25:36,430 --> 01:25:37,030
What?!

2104
01:25:38,710 --> 01:25:39,310
Oh!

2105
01:25:40,030 --> 01:25:41,130
This is not fair.

2106
01:25:43,250 --> 01:25:44,450
That's not fair!

2107
01:25:44,630 --> 01:25:45,550
There's two of you!

2108
01:25:48,350 --> 01:25:49,670
Oh my god.

2109
01:25:49,730 --> 01:25:51,450
Oh my godas!

2110
01:25:53,370 --> 01:25:53,590
Oh my god!

2111
01:25:54,350 --> 01:25:56,010
Oh my god, I don't have jellyfish.

2112
01:25:56,130 --> 01:25:57,270
I DON'T HAVE JELLY FISH!

2113
01:25:57,350 --> 01:25:57,490
I don't have jellyfish ah!

2114
01:25:59,330 --> 01:25:59,970
AH!

2115
01:26:00,910 --> 01:26:01,970
I forgot!

2116
01:26:02,230 --> 01:26:02,550
I need...

2117
01:26:03,250 --> 01:26:06,190
I need magic to summon him.

2118
01:26:08,430 --> 01:26:10,450
Oh, I need the jellyfish.

2119
01:26:10,570 --> 01:26:10,850
Okay.

2120
01:26:11,190 --> 01:26:11,710
Alright.

2121
01:26:11,710 --> 01:26:12,870
I figured it out.

2122
01:26:13,890 --> 01:26:15,690
Okay, I need my duo, too.

2123
01:26:17,070 --> 01:26:18,630
Okay, we just gotta run past everything.

2124
01:26:18,910 --> 01:26:21,550
I hope... I hope we can survive.

2125
01:26:24,130 --> 01:26:25,690
Oh my god, oh my god.

2126
01:26:26,850 --> 01:26:27,290
Whoa!

2127
01:26:28,910 --> 01:26:29,390
Whoa!

2128
01:26:31,370 --> 01:26:33,030
Guys, I don't remember how to get there.

2129
01:26:35,530 --> 01:26:36,530
Okay, it's this way.

2130
01:26:36,850 --> 01:26:37,450
Okay, I remember.

2131
01:26:37,790 --> 01:26:38,850
I remember now.

2132
01:26:42,090 --> 01:26:42,690
Woo!

2133
01:26:44,210 --> 01:26:46,310
Alright, I'll recharge this.

2134
01:26:47,250 --> 01:26:50,510
And then... we go forward.

2135
01:26:51,530 --> 01:26:56,050
And then we make... wait, the big guy isn't even, like... didn't even jump down for me.

2136
01:26:57,050 --> 01:26:58,050
Alright, now!

2137
01:27:01,390 --> 01:27:02,830
Now I have enough of jellyfish.

2138
01:27:02,990 --> 01:27:03,170
Alright.

2139
01:27:03,810 --> 01:27:06,150
Do I make this a 2v2?

2140
01:27:06,530 --> 01:27:07,710
Fucking, there you go.

2141
01:27:08,850 --> 01:27:10,150
Alright, let me grab this real fast.

2142
01:27:11,930 --> 01:27:12,430
Nice.

2143
01:27:12,650 --> 01:27:13,010
Haha!

2144
01:27:13,390 --> 01:27:14,190
That's fucking right.

2145
01:27:18,890 --> 01:27:19,990
That's fucking right.

2146
01:27:21,170 --> 01:27:22,030
Oh, fuck!

2147
01:27:22,470 --> 01:27:23,150
I'm sorry.

2148
01:27:23,330 --> 01:27:24,070
I'm so sorry.

2149
01:27:24,230 --> 01:27:25,130
I'm so sorry.

2150
01:27:25,330 --> 01:27:25,990
I'm so sorry.

2151
01:27:26,130 --> 01:27:27,090
I didn't mean that.

2152
01:27:31,530 --> 01:27:33,550
Oh my god!

2153
01:27:35,570 --> 01:27:37,490
Oh, holy shit!

2154
01:27:37,650 --> 01:27:39,730
Does he not stop?!

2155
01:27:39,730 --> 01:27:39,730
Holy shit!

2156
01:27:39,730 --> 01:27:40,790
Does he not stop?!

2157
01:27:40,790 --> 01:27:41,910
Oh, fuck!

2158
01:27:45,230 --> 01:27:45,490
Okay.

2159
01:27:47,490 --> 01:27:48,690
Holy shit!

2160
01:27:48,850 --> 01:27:50,770
All these attacks are so strong!

2161
01:27:50,970 --> 01:27:52,690
His attacks are so strong!

2162
01:27:53,630 --> 01:27:54,110
Oh!

2163
01:27:54,110 --> 01:27:54,510
Oh!

2164
01:27:56,730 --> 01:27:57,410
Oh my god!

2165
01:27:57,510 --> 01:27:57,730
Please!

2166
01:27:57,890 --> 01:27:58,610
Just let me here!

2167
01:27:59,630 --> 01:28:00,550
Holy fuck!

2168
01:28:00,690 --> 01:28:01,490
Just let me here!

2169
01:28:02,110 --> 01:28:02,590
Please!

2170
01:28:02,730 --> 01:28:03,390
I'm lagging!

2171
01:28:04,190 --> 01:28:05,690
I'm messing with his praise.

2172
01:28:10,650 --> 01:28:11,770
Oh my god, he's one hit.

2173
01:28:12,170 --> 01:28:12,710
Oh, thank god.

2174
01:28:13,030 --> 01:28:13,590
That's right.

2175
01:28:13,850 --> 01:28:14,650
1v1 time.

2176
01:28:14,650 --> 01:28:16,190
You have no perfume now.

2177
01:28:16,190 --> 01:28:17,810
What you gonna do?

2178
01:28:18,570 --> 01:28:20,530
What you gonna do?

2179
01:28:21,250 --> 01:28:23,550
No more perfume for you!

2180
01:28:26,410 --> 01:28:28,370
Get out of here!

2181
01:28:33,110 --> 01:28:34,350
That's right.

2182
01:28:34,550 --> 01:28:35,890
I killed your buddy.

2183
01:28:36,690 --> 01:28:37,610
Fucking nerd.

2184
01:28:38,110 --> 01:28:39,910
Stupid magic users.

2185
01:28:43,070 --> 01:28:44,350
Support eliminated.

2186
01:28:44,350 --> 01:28:44,650
Support eliminated.

2187
01:28:46,210 --> 01:28:46,730
Wait.

2188
01:28:48,290 --> 01:28:49,570
It's like...

2189
01:28:55,370 --> 01:28:56,310
Holy shit!

2190
01:28:56,430 --> 01:28:59,330
That was crazy fucking lag though!

2191
01:28:59,810 --> 01:29:01,050
That was crazy!

2192
01:29:01,630 --> 01:29:02,810
Okay, let me check my...

2193
01:29:02,810 --> 01:29:05,550
I need to check what my CPU is after that.

2194
01:29:05,970 --> 01:29:07,830
That area, like...

2195
01:29:07,830 --> 01:29:10,750
Oh my god, lagging like crazy there.

2196
01:29:10,750 --> 01:29:13,430
Oh my... I went to a hundred percent CPU.

2197
01:29:14,530 --> 01:29:15,890
Holy shit!

2198
01:29:16,510 --> 01:29:16,990
Yeah!

2199
01:29:18,270 --> 01:29:19,970
Oh my god!

2200
01:29:20,570 --> 01:29:23,890
I actually went to like a hundred percent there.

2201
01:29:26,430 --> 01:29:26,770
Alright.

2202
01:29:27,150 --> 01:29:28,370
So yeah, I got CPU...

2203
01:29:28,370 --> 01:29:30,090
I ordered a CPU upgrade.

2204
01:29:30,390 --> 01:29:32,090
Um, but like...

2205
01:29:32,090 --> 01:29:35,290
I just didn't have time to take it to the store yet.

2206
01:29:35,590 --> 01:29:36,710
To get installed.

2207
01:29:40,570 --> 01:29:42,050
Alright, return to entrance.

2208
01:29:43,030 --> 01:29:44,350
Oh no, I tabbed out.

2209
01:29:44,470 --> 01:29:45,270
That's why I was lagging.

2210
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,240
Cause I was checking my...

2211
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:55,520
Uh...

2212
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:56,140
But that...

2213
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:57,920
There was just...

2214
01:29:57,920 --> 01:30:00,420
One too many bosses on my screen.

2215
01:30:00,620 --> 01:30:03,100
Like, I didn't know what was going on at that point.

2216
01:30:05,460 --> 01:30:06,900
Alright, give me your arrows.

2217
01:30:10,740 --> 01:30:11,300
Alright.

2218
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:13,820
The perfume.

2219
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:14,980
It got my CPU.

2220
01:30:16,220 --> 01:30:17,160
Oh, I can level up.

2221
01:30:17,240 --> 01:30:17,500
Oh yeah.

2222
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:18,840
No, actually...

2223
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:19,980
Oh shit.

2224
01:30:21,220 --> 01:30:21,280
Okay.

2225
01:30:21,380 --> 01:30:22,180
I definitely need to level up.

2226
01:30:22,260 --> 01:30:22,800
Actually drink.

2227
01:30:23,980 --> 01:30:24,380
Uh...

2228
01:30:24,380 --> 01:30:25,300
A thousand two hundred.

2229
01:30:25,580 --> 01:30:26,420
Okay, we use this.

2230
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:27,440
That'll be fine.

2231
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:31,600
Alright.

2232
01:30:32,620 --> 01:30:33,860
Now we can level up.

2233
01:30:39,080 --> 01:30:39,580
Let's go.

2234
01:30:39,580 --> 01:30:39,920
Nevermind.

2235
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:41,140
Wait.

2236
01:30:41,260 --> 01:30:42,580
I can just fight these little guys.

2237
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:44,960
They'll give me some stuff.

2238
01:30:49,690 --> 01:30:50,110
Okay.

2239
01:30:50,110 --> 01:30:51,230
Let me get him out first.

2240
01:30:52,010 --> 01:30:53,470
And then I'll take care of him.

2241
01:30:55,890 --> 01:30:57,130
Get out of here!

2242
01:30:58,050 --> 01:30:58,350
Okay.

2243
01:30:58,590 --> 01:31:00,130
Now I can level up.

2244
01:31:00,690 --> 01:31:01,850
Navy, thank you for the super chat.

2245
01:31:01,930 --> 01:31:02,190
Thank you.

2246
01:31:02,270 --> 01:31:02,650
Thank you.

2247
01:31:02,710 --> 01:31:07,410
I regret having mentioned message appraisal heals on first Elden Ring stream.

2248
01:31:08,110 --> 01:31:09,150
Sorry chat!

2249
01:31:09,750 --> 01:31:12,270
Thank you for the super chat.

2250
01:31:12,430 --> 01:31:12,770
Thank you.

2251
01:31:12,910 --> 01:31:13,510
Thank you.

2252
01:31:14,830 --> 01:31:16,030
It was him.

2253
01:31:17,170 --> 01:31:18,610
Remember his name.

2254
01:31:19,250 --> 01:31:20,510
He did this.

2255
01:31:24,770 --> 01:31:26,630
To be fair, I was gonna leave...

2256
01:31:26,630 --> 01:31:28,610
I was gonna leave a lot of message regardless.

2257
01:31:29,110 --> 01:31:29,470
So like...

2258
01:31:29,850 --> 01:31:31,910
I would've figured it out later on.

2259
01:31:32,690 --> 01:31:35,450
Influencer build is my favorite build.

2260
01:31:35,630 --> 01:31:36,110
You!

2261
01:31:39,030 --> 01:31:41,630
I was gonna leave messages anyway.

2262
01:31:42,890 --> 01:31:43,270
Alright.

2263
01:31:44,290 --> 01:31:45,450
Guys, what do we get?

2264
01:31:45,550 --> 01:31:47,110
We already got level 40 vigor.

2265
01:31:49,210 --> 01:31:50,530
What do we get now?

2266
01:31:57,730 --> 01:31:58,390
Endurance?

2267
01:31:58,830 --> 01:31:59,770
Endurance now?

2268
01:31:59,990 --> 01:32:01,290
Okay, we'll grab Endurance.

2269
01:32:04,070 --> 01:32:04,730
Alright.

2270
01:32:06,790 --> 01:32:07,770
Endurance time.

2271
01:32:12,140 --> 01:32:14,660
If only I could level up my messages.

2272
01:32:15,100 --> 01:32:16,500
They're already too good.

2273
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:20,920
My message is already too good for this world.

2274
01:32:23,480 --> 01:32:23,980
Alright.

2275
01:32:24,740 --> 01:32:25,840
And then some Dexterity.

2276
01:32:25,900 --> 01:32:28,060
We'll do another Endurance and then Dexterity later.

2277
01:32:30,780 --> 01:32:31,900
Oh, hey, item.

2278
01:32:35,820 --> 01:32:38,620
Thank you for the super chat, broken fun.

2279
01:32:38,860 --> 01:32:39,760
Thank you, thank you.

2280
01:32:40,740 --> 01:32:41,040
Alright.

2281
01:32:41,460 --> 01:32:44,800
Yes, I will use my horse just for this one fucking jump.

2282
01:32:45,580 --> 01:32:46,080
I...

2283
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:46,340
Whoa!

2284
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,280
Haha, got the runes.

2285
01:32:48,440 --> 01:32:49,500
Haha, what you gonna do?

2286
01:32:49,880 --> 01:32:50,820
Now, bitch.

2287
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:52,440
That's right, I stole your...

2288
01:32:52,940 --> 01:32:54,100
That's right, I stole your shit.

2289
01:32:54,940 --> 01:32:56,380
Oh shit, it's Perfume Man.

2290
01:32:57,220 --> 01:32:57,600
So...

2291
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:58,360
Oh...

2292
01:32:58,360 --> 01:32:59,960
Wait, that's what he was doing?

2293
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:01,620
He was doing fire all along?

2294
01:33:03,220 --> 01:33:04,580
Oh my god!

2295
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:06,180
Oh my god!

2296
01:33:13,660 --> 01:33:14,180
Okay.

2297
01:33:14,760 --> 01:33:18,920
That was like a stronger version of whatever the fuck.

2298
01:33:19,160 --> 01:33:21,760
A weaker version of the boss I fought earlier.

2299
01:33:22,420 --> 01:33:23,880
Oh my god.

2300
01:33:24,820 --> 01:33:25,860
Oh my...

2301
01:33:25,860 --> 01:33:26,500
Please, sir.

2302
01:33:26,620 --> 01:33:27,020
Please, sir.

2303
01:33:27,060 --> 01:33:28,000
I'm stuttering right now.

2304
01:33:28,160 --> 01:33:28,900
Please, sir.

2305
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:29,480
I'm stuttering.

2306
01:33:29,740 --> 01:33:30,820
Please, sir.

2307
01:33:30,920 --> 01:33:31,220
Sir.

2308
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:31,640
Sir.

2309
01:33:32,040 --> 01:33:34,200
I'm actually stuttering right now.

2310
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:35,200
Sir, this is not fair.

2311
01:33:35,200 --> 01:33:36,480
Is it...

2312
01:33:38,540 --> 01:33:43,120
I don't know what it is about you, but you are taking up too much of my frames right now.

2313
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:44,400
Holy fuck.

2314
01:33:44,660 --> 01:33:46,120
Like, what's wrong with you?

2315
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:51,040
He was so strong at the scene.

2316
01:33:51,320 --> 01:33:52,380
Like, this guy...

2317
01:33:52,380 --> 01:33:57,340
This one guy in particular actually was taking up so much in my CPU.

2318
01:34:01,780 --> 01:34:04,020
It's okay, we're getting our CPU upgraded.

2319
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:05,120
Like...

2320
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:06,020
Later...

2321
01:34:06,020 --> 01:34:06,860
This week.

2322
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:07,820
Maybe next week.

2323
01:34:10,940 --> 01:34:11,960
After the...

2324
01:34:11,960 --> 01:34:12,840
After...

2325
01:34:12,840 --> 01:34:13,340
The birthday.

2326
01:34:13,580 --> 01:34:14,280
Oh, there's the item.

2327
01:34:15,700 --> 01:34:15,980
Oh!

2328
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:17,080
And...

2329
01:34:17,080 --> 01:34:17,880
The omen killer.

2330
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:20,040
Nice.

2331
01:34:20,300 --> 01:34:21,320
Now, I didn't drop a weapon.

2332
01:34:21,420 --> 01:34:22,000
Dropped his clothes.

2333
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:23,140
I literally, like...

2334
01:34:23,140 --> 01:34:24,380
Stole the clothes off his back.

2335
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:25,120
Nice.

2336
01:34:25,980 --> 01:34:26,680
That's right.

2337
01:34:28,220 --> 01:34:29,820
I killed your friend.

2338
01:34:30,460 --> 01:34:30,940
Huh!

2339
01:34:32,540 --> 01:34:33,860
That's fucking right.

2340
01:34:34,860 --> 01:34:35,820
That's right.

2341
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:37,620
No one will tend to you now!

2342
01:34:40,580 --> 01:34:41,940
That's fucking right.

2343
01:34:42,620 --> 01:34:44,200
I killed your owner!

2344
01:34:46,100 --> 01:34:48,200
Now who will water you?

2345
01:34:49,980 --> 01:34:50,760
Alright.

2346
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:51,760
Chest time.

2347
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:54,300
Oh, I got a cookbook.

2348
01:34:59,150 --> 01:34:59,690
Alright.

2349
01:35:01,770 --> 01:35:05,870
Yeah, maybe I should have played Elden Ring on, uh...

2350
01:35:05,870 --> 01:35:06,930
On a PlayStation.

2351
01:35:08,110 --> 01:35:10,090
So we don't have the sudden issues.

2352
01:35:10,410 --> 01:35:11,070
It's too late!

2353
01:35:11,450 --> 01:35:12,770
We're committed now!

2354
01:35:13,910 --> 01:35:15,570
Poison the head and then talisman.

2355
01:35:15,650 --> 01:35:15,890
Ooh!

2356
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:21,360
Oh, shit.

2357
01:35:22,160 --> 01:35:23,040
Wait, okay.

2358
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:24,900
I mean, eh...

2359
01:35:24,900 --> 01:35:26,220
Just baby flowers.

2360
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:29,220
I can chop this flower down.

2361
01:35:29,860 --> 01:35:30,840
Oh my god!

2362
01:35:31,020 --> 01:35:31,620
Wait, maybe?

2363
01:35:31,980 --> 01:35:32,420
Not?

2364
01:35:33,240 --> 01:35:34,940
Okay, maybe I gotta...

2365
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:36,280
Okay!

2366
01:35:37,020 --> 01:35:39,460
Okay, maybe the flower wins this time.

2367
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:40,240
Okay, give me a sec.

2368
01:35:40,420 --> 01:35:42,560
I am slowly dying of poison right now.

2369
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:43,620
I am...

2370
01:35:46,020 --> 01:35:48,420
I'm very slowly dying of poison.

2371
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:51,700
Give me a sec.

2372
01:35:51,700 --> 01:35:51,800
I...

2373
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:53,760
I sort of like...

2374
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:56,600
There was a sign that said Poison Ivy here.

2375
01:35:56,740 --> 01:35:57,960
And I was like, I don't care.

2376
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:03,600
It's like, oh my god!

2377
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:04,340
That's a...

2378
01:36:04,340 --> 01:36:06,440
That was a lot of poison ivy.

2379
01:36:09,780 --> 01:36:10,900
Alright, it's like when...

2380
01:36:11,320 --> 01:36:13,320
I'm basically having the Pokemon treatment.

2381
01:36:13,640 --> 01:36:16,740
The early gen Pokemon where every step you're slowly dying.

2382
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:19,820
Wait, isn't this like the newer Pokemon?

2383
01:36:19,820 --> 01:36:21,020
They don't have that anymore.

2384
01:36:21,560 --> 01:36:23,820
They like actually got rid of the...

2385
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:25,160
Uh...

2386
01:36:25,160 --> 01:36:26,820
They got rid of the feature where...

2387
01:36:28,180 --> 01:36:28,620
Uh...

2388
01:36:28,620 --> 01:36:31,220
Where every step you take...

2389
01:36:32,660 --> 01:36:34,620
Doesn't like give you poison damage anymore.

2390
01:36:35,220 --> 01:36:36,320
Yeah, cause like...

2391
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:38,220
They're like, we don't want to traumatize the kids.

2392
01:36:41,380 --> 01:36:42,660
Yeah, they got rid of it.

2393
01:36:42,660 --> 01:36:44,660
Yeah, they took that out a long time ago.

2394
01:36:45,080 --> 01:36:46,200
From what I remember.

2395
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:48,760
They're like, we don't want to traumatize the kids.

2396
01:36:49,740 --> 01:36:51,760
Just really realize, kids don't like that.

2397
01:36:53,060 --> 01:36:54,720
Yeah, but kids have to learn!

2398
01:36:55,680 --> 01:36:58,020
The world is not a happy place!

2399
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:00,780
You gotta teach them while they're young.

2400
01:37:01,080 --> 01:37:03,600
Holy shit, this flower just tried to beat me up.

2401
01:37:07,570 --> 01:37:10,190
We're babying children way too much now.

2402
01:37:12,070 --> 01:37:13,310
Is that the talisman?

2403
01:37:13,610 --> 01:37:13,910
Ooh.

2404
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:17,760
Alright.

2405
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:19,340
Yeah, we have to learn.

2406
01:37:19,460 --> 01:37:21,180
We have to live through that trauma!

2407
01:37:21,620 --> 01:37:25,100
If I have to live through that trauma, they have to too!

2408
01:37:27,160 --> 01:37:29,440
Okay, speaking of kids shows...

2409
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:30,040
Who the fuck's...

2410
01:37:30,040 --> 01:37:31,700
Okay, did anyone saw that Tiny Chef shit?

2411
01:37:31,860 --> 01:37:32,400
That's...

2412
01:37:33,860 --> 01:37:35,380
That shit was crazy!

2413
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:37,360
Like...

2414
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:39,080
Oh my god...

2415
01:37:40,300 --> 01:37:41,400
There's like...

2416
01:37:41,900 --> 01:37:42,980
Tiny Chef...

2417
01:37:42,980 --> 01:37:46,020
I actually watched an episode of Tiny Chef.

2418
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:47,680
Because I was like, I was like, what?

2419
01:37:47,980 --> 01:37:50,080
He was like, but we won an Emmy!

2420
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:51,780
I was like, what show is this?

2421
01:37:51,780 --> 01:37:52,820
Like...

2422
01:37:52,820 --> 01:37:53,660
So...

2423
01:37:53,660 --> 01:37:54,900
Okay, so...

2424
01:37:54,900 --> 01:37:55,420
Um...

2425
01:37:55,420 --> 01:37:57,240
Nickelodeon cancelled this, like...

2426
01:37:57,240 --> 01:37:59,220
It's basically Tiny Chef is like...

2427
01:37:59,220 --> 01:38:01,200
This generation's Teletubbies.

2428
01:38:01,580 --> 01:38:02,180
Um...

2429
01:38:02,180 --> 01:38:02,800
And it's like...

2430
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:04,300
It's basically like a kids' show.

2431
01:38:04,460 --> 01:38:06,260
So, it's like, this generation's like...

2432
01:38:06,780 --> 01:38:08,300
Teletubbies slash between the lions.

2433
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:09,220
And shit like that.

2434
01:38:09,580 --> 01:38:10,780
So, um...

2435
01:38:12,280 --> 01:38:12,880
So...

2436
01:38:13,620 --> 01:38:17,220
Like, they recently released a small animation...

2437
01:38:17,220 --> 01:38:18,900
Where they basically like...

2438
01:38:18,900 --> 01:38:19,160
But...

2439
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:20,440
Um...

2440
01:38:20,440 --> 01:38:22,120
They got a call from Nickelodeon.

2441
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:24,120
And Nickelodeon was like, you're cancelled.

2442
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:24,660
We're...

2443
01:38:24,660 --> 01:38:25,540
We're cancelling you.

2444
01:38:25,720 --> 01:38:26,880
And then he was like...

2445
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:28,080
We won an Emmy!

2446
01:38:28,440 --> 01:38:29,220
And then...

2447
01:38:29,220 --> 01:38:30,780
I was so sad!

2448
01:38:31,220 --> 01:38:32,240
I even...

2449
01:38:32,240 --> 01:38:34,100
I'll kill him for a time.

2450
01:38:34,380 --> 01:38:34,940
Thank you, Chef.

2451
01:38:35,340 --> 01:38:37,020
Thank you for the Super Chat cookie.

2452
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:38,140
Thank you, thank you.

2453
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:39,180
And then like...

2454
01:38:39,180 --> 01:38:40,280
The call was ended.

2455
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:42,100
And he just sat there and cried.

2456
01:38:42,860 --> 01:38:43,300
And like...

2457
01:38:43,300 --> 01:38:44,640
I was like, holy shit!

2458
01:38:44,640 --> 01:38:45,560
What?

2459
01:38:46,140 --> 01:38:47,140
What the fuck?

2460
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:47,680
What the fuck?

2461
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:49,120
And he just like...

2462
01:38:49,120 --> 01:38:49,780
Sat in his bed.

2463
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,560
And just started crying.

2464
01:38:52,160 --> 01:38:53,340
And I was like...

2465
01:38:53,340 --> 01:38:54,460
Oh my god!

2466
01:38:54,760 --> 01:38:55,480
This is...

2467
01:38:55,480 --> 01:38:55,820
Oh!

2468
01:38:55,960 --> 01:38:57,040
This is too real!

2469
01:38:57,500 --> 01:38:57,860
I...

2470
01:38:57,860 --> 01:38:59,420
It was so real!

2471
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:01,200
That's...

2472
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:01,800
That's...

2473
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:02,840
No...

2474
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:04,400
You'll understand when you...

2475
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:05,240
Okay, you can...

2476
01:39:05,240 --> 01:39:06,220
Try and google...

2477
01:39:06,220 --> 01:39:07,060
Tiny Chef.

2478
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:08,320
The Tiny Chef Show.

2479
01:39:08,460 --> 01:39:09,380
And then watch the clip.

2480
01:39:09,580 --> 01:39:10,520
It's actually...

2481
01:39:10,520 --> 01:39:12,080
So fucking depressing.

2482
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:13,600
Ha ha ha ha!

2483
01:39:13,960 --> 01:39:14,940
Ha ha ha ha!

2484
01:39:16,440 --> 01:39:18,080
Alright, let's see...

2485
01:39:18,780 --> 01:39:20,840
Any shrine I was supposed to...

2486
01:39:20,840 --> 01:39:21,740
Where's the map?

2487
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:22,380
Anyway...

2488
01:39:22,380 --> 01:39:23,180
Don't go for MI.

2489
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:25,460
It was so sad.

2490
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:26,880
But it was basically like...

2491
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:27,160
It was...

2492
01:39:27,160 --> 01:39:27,880
It went viral.

2493
01:39:28,100 --> 01:39:28,680
Because they were ch...

2494
01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:29,260
Um...

2495
01:39:29,260 --> 01:39:29,880
It was a clip.

2496
01:39:30,280 --> 01:39:30,600
Uh...

2497
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:31,720
Trying to get like support.

2498
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:33,060
To like produce the show.

2499
01:39:33,220 --> 01:39:33,960
Without funding.

2500
01:39:34,240 --> 01:39:35,140
From Nickelodeon.

2501
01:39:35,340 --> 01:39:37,860
So they can keep making more shorts and stuff for YouTube.

2502
01:39:38,820 --> 01:39:39,220
And...

2503
01:39:39,220 --> 01:39:41,080
And keep Tiny Chef alive.

2504
01:39:42,120 --> 01:39:43,260
There's a cave here?

2505
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:45,540
Okay, then it has to be around these rocks.

2506
01:39:45,700 --> 01:39:46,340
That I'm like...

2507
01:39:47,640 --> 01:39:48,160
Uh...

2508
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:49,240
Walking around right now.

2509
01:39:50,120 --> 01:39:52,260
So many giant ass fucking flowers.

2510
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:57,800
It looked like a robot chicken skin.

2511
01:39:57,880 --> 01:39:59,080
I couldn't believe it was real.

2512
01:39:59,260 --> 01:39:59,980
I was like...

2513
01:39:59,980 --> 01:40:00,820
What the fuck?

2514
01:40:01,120 --> 01:40:01,360
What?

2515
01:40:01,740 --> 01:40:02,460
What's that?

2516
01:40:02,840 --> 01:40:03,220
Wait, what?

2517
01:40:03,380 --> 01:40:04,460
Started using magic.

2518
01:40:05,240 --> 01:40:05,760
What?

2519
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:09,400
What was that?

2520
01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:12,940
Who's fucking using magic on me?

2521
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:16,100
Are these...

2522
01:40:16,100 --> 01:40:16,880
Are these nerds?

2523
01:40:16,940 --> 01:40:17,740
Oh my god.

2524
01:40:18,780 --> 01:40:20,420
They're flower nerds?

2525
01:40:22,380 --> 01:40:23,180
I was like...

2526
01:40:23,180 --> 01:40:24,660
Who the fuck is trying to...

2527
01:40:24,660 --> 01:40:26,080
Use magic on me right now?

2528
01:40:28,980 --> 01:40:30,200
Oh, there's the cave.

2529
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:32,760
Alright, nice.

2530
01:40:33,640 --> 01:40:35,060
Be wary of secret?

2531
01:40:36,420 --> 01:40:37,140
Fuck ah.

2532
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:38,660
I do this alone.

2533
01:40:39,080 --> 01:40:39,620
Get out of here.

2534
01:40:39,740 --> 01:40:41,240
You're not supposed to be adventuring.

2535
01:40:44,710 --> 01:40:45,230
Alright.

2536
01:40:45,910 --> 01:40:46,970
Let's grab this grace.

2537
01:40:55,300 --> 01:40:55,820
Alright.

2538
01:40:56,120 --> 01:40:56,820
Let's see.

2539
01:40:57,220 --> 01:40:57,880
Do I haven't?

2540
01:40:58,000 --> 01:40:58,460
No, I don't.

2541
01:41:00,200 --> 01:41:01,620
I'm gonna find another church.

2542
01:41:02,360 --> 01:41:05,180
I like how I keep opening these summoning pools.

2543
01:41:05,360 --> 01:41:06,740
But I've never been using them.

2544
01:41:10,390 --> 01:41:11,180
I knew it.

2545
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:12,400
I knew it.

2546
01:41:12,760 --> 01:41:14,340
You can't fool me.

2547
01:41:15,120 --> 01:41:16,960
I knew you weren't real.

2548
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:18,520
Oh shit.

2549
01:41:19,420 --> 01:41:20,400
That's a big boy.

2550
01:41:22,460 --> 01:41:23,120
Goodbye.

2551
01:41:25,780 --> 01:41:27,440
Oh wait, am I supposed to go down?

2552
01:41:28,460 --> 01:41:29,520
Oh shit.

2553
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:31,360
Wait.

2554
01:41:31,700 --> 01:41:32,040
What?

2555
01:41:32,620 --> 01:41:33,660
How did I get across?

2556
01:41:35,400 --> 01:41:36,440
Oh, I knew it.

2557
01:41:36,580 --> 01:41:37,100
I fucking...

2558
01:41:37,100 --> 01:41:37,540
I was like...

2559
01:41:37,540 --> 01:41:38,660
Okay, this thing...

2560
01:41:39,820 --> 01:41:41,420
That looks weirdly placed.

2561
01:41:44,640 --> 01:41:45,840
Yeah, I'm not jumping.

2562
01:41:50,240 --> 01:41:52,480
I was like, why is there an indent here?

2563
01:41:52,840 --> 01:41:53,860
First off, dung?

2564
01:41:54,100 --> 01:41:54,540
Why?

2565
01:41:59,460 --> 01:42:01,660
Beware left and beware of a hidden path.

2566
01:42:02,840 --> 01:42:04,100
There's something here.

2567
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:10,060
Wooden rune.

2568
01:42:10,620 --> 01:42:12,560
Oh, that's the hidden path.

2569
01:42:12,700 --> 01:42:12,880
Okay.

2570
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:16,820
Oh, I'll grab...

2571
01:42:16,820 --> 01:42:18,180
I guess I'll grab the bugs.

2572
01:42:19,660 --> 01:42:22,140
Wait, okay, so there's a hidden path here.

2573
01:42:22,820 --> 01:42:23,840
I assume.

2574
01:42:26,620 --> 01:42:27,080
Whoa!

2575
01:42:30,440 --> 01:42:31,080
No!

2576
01:42:31,080 --> 01:42:32,600
It's like, no girls allowed!

2577
01:42:36,340 --> 01:42:36,980
Hey!

2578
01:42:37,380 --> 01:42:38,700
No girls allowed!

2579
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:39,560
Get out!

2580
01:42:39,780 --> 01:42:41,200
This is a secret fan club!

2581
01:42:47,180 --> 01:42:47,820
Alright.

2582
01:42:50,760 --> 01:42:52,320
Alright, let's grab these items.

2583
01:42:53,060 --> 01:42:53,860
Are there mimics here?

2584
01:42:55,440 --> 01:42:57,320
Well, I'm about to find out.

2585
01:42:58,920 --> 01:43:00,960
Let's slowly open these.

2586
01:43:05,620 --> 01:43:06,500
Okay, nice.

2587
01:43:06,640 --> 01:43:07,480
There's no mimics here.

2588
01:43:07,660 --> 01:43:08,140
Thank God.

2589
01:43:11,080 --> 01:43:13,120
No mimics, sadly!

2590
01:43:16,520 --> 01:43:18,320
You only say that because...

2591
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:22,380
But when it happens to you, you'd be happy that there's no mimics.

2592
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:26,300
Okay, guys.

2593
01:43:27,300 --> 01:43:27,940
Just you two?

2594
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:29,960
Ow!

2595
01:43:31,820 --> 01:43:33,660
Okay, you two is all they need, apparently.

2596
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:40,740
Holy shit, why are you stronger than like...

2597
01:43:42,460 --> 01:43:43,780
Oh my god!

2598
01:43:48,280 --> 01:43:50,480
Okay, it's not just these two guys.

2599
01:43:51,020 --> 01:43:54,020
I just found out it's not just these two.

2600
01:43:55,320 --> 01:43:56,420
It's not just them.

2601
01:43:56,640 --> 01:43:57,460
It's not just them.

2602
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:00,480
Okay.

2603
01:44:00,860 --> 01:44:01,560
That's fine.

2604
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:04,280
I don't think he knows how to jump.

2605
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:05,200
I...

2606
01:44:09,420 --> 01:44:10,340
Holy shit!

2607
01:44:15,810 --> 01:44:17,090
Oh my god.

2608
01:44:17,290 --> 01:44:18,690
He does so much.

2609
01:44:19,990 --> 01:44:20,910
That's crazy!

2610
01:44:23,630 --> 01:44:25,050
Okay, I think I can kill them right here.

2611
01:44:25,810 --> 01:44:26,690
Okay, thank God.

2612
01:44:26,830 --> 01:44:27,550
Okay, I can kill them.

2613
01:44:28,150 --> 01:44:29,330
Oh, please tell me.

2614
01:44:29,550 --> 01:44:30,970
Oh my god, he's...

2615
01:44:30,970 --> 01:44:32,050
One of them too.

2616
01:44:33,550 --> 01:44:35,590
Holy shit, he did so much damage.

2617
01:44:37,270 --> 01:44:38,410
I don't think...

2618
01:44:38,410 --> 01:44:39,790
Yeah, he doesn't need a jump.

2619
01:44:39,950 --> 01:44:41,050
Oh my god.

2620
01:44:43,450 --> 01:44:45,650
I like how his buddy was like, Don't worry, guys.

2621
01:44:45,770 --> 01:44:46,270
I'll keep watch.

2622
01:44:49,630 --> 01:44:50,690
Don't worry, guys.

2623
01:44:51,270 --> 01:44:52,950
I'll keep watch right here.

2624
01:44:53,210 --> 01:44:54,530
You guys got this, right?

2625
01:44:54,850 --> 01:44:56,650
Hey, how come you stopped making noises?

2626
01:44:57,010 --> 01:44:58,170
You guys still got this?

2627
01:45:02,080 --> 01:45:03,260
Alright, let me go this way.

2628
01:45:09,930 --> 01:45:11,130
I don't like that.

2629
01:45:13,470 --> 01:45:14,710
People died here.

2630
01:45:16,430 --> 01:45:18,370
Why did people die here?

2631
01:45:19,970 --> 01:45:21,370
Why did...

2632
01:45:25,310 --> 01:45:27,170
Why did people died here?

2633
01:45:27,890 --> 01:45:28,530
Why did...

2634
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,480
Why did so many people die here?

2635
01:45:36,640 --> 01:45:38,400
It's probably nothing.

2636
01:45:40,240 --> 01:45:40,800
What?

2637
01:45:41,180 --> 01:45:42,600
Oh, I'm so paranoid.

2638
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:45,160
There's so many bodies.

2639
01:45:52,010 --> 01:45:53,450
How did they all die?

2640
01:45:53,730 --> 01:45:55,430
Oh, did they not kill the skellies?

2641
01:45:57,290 --> 01:45:57,850
Oh...

2642
01:45:57,850 --> 01:45:58,550
Foolish.

2643
01:45:59,670 --> 01:46:00,170
Yeah.

2644
01:46:01,630 --> 01:46:02,110
Alright.

2645
01:46:02,110 --> 01:46:03,550
Oh, I...

2646
01:46:07,990 --> 01:46:10,130
I don't know what it's worth.

2647
01:46:12,530 --> 01:46:14,790
Just saw the tiny chef clip.

2648
01:46:15,190 --> 01:46:15,370
How?

2649
01:46:15,810 --> 01:46:16,110
Why?

2650
01:46:16,650 --> 01:46:17,970
But they won an Emmy!

2651
01:46:18,550 --> 01:46:20,670
I think that jerk did you with a super chap.

2652
01:46:20,790 --> 01:46:21,630
They can take it.

2653
01:46:21,770 --> 01:46:22,810
I don't!

2654
01:46:23,030 --> 01:46:23,730
That's the thing!

2655
01:46:23,870 --> 01:46:24,330
They won...

2656
01:46:24,330 --> 01:46:26,810
They won two Emmys!

2657
01:46:30,790 --> 01:46:31,230
Okay.

2658
01:46:31,410 --> 01:46:31,950
I can do this.

2659
01:46:32,230 --> 01:46:32,890
Oh, I can!

2660
01:46:33,390 --> 01:46:34,410
Believe in yourself.

2661
01:46:39,460 --> 01:46:41,400
Believe in me who believes in you.

2662
01:46:45,360 --> 01:46:46,240
Okay, but...

2663
01:46:47,380 --> 01:46:48,260
Try attacking.

2664
01:46:49,660 --> 01:46:50,300
Oh, nice.

2665
01:46:50,420 --> 01:46:50,740
More loot.

2666
01:46:54,860 --> 01:46:55,440
Alright.

2667
01:46:56,440 --> 01:46:56,600
Ooh!

2668
01:46:57,680 --> 01:46:59,040
Raptor's bird feathers!

2669
01:47:00,180 --> 01:47:01,440
Ooh, more armor!

2670
01:47:01,900 --> 01:47:03,860
Okay, but where does, like, this go, though?

2671
01:47:05,820 --> 01:47:06,980
There's, like...

2672
01:47:06,980 --> 01:47:08,800
There's clearly something over here.

2673
01:47:13,500 --> 01:47:14,480
Ah, rat.

2674
01:47:14,860 --> 01:47:15,800
Invisible swords.

2675
01:47:16,020 --> 01:47:17,400
Therefore, bright spot.

2676
01:47:17,540 --> 01:47:18,300
Oh, my God!

2677
01:47:18,420 --> 01:47:19,620
There's a boss here!

2678
01:47:19,900 --> 01:47:22,060
Alright, we'll deal with the boss later.

2679
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:24,520
There might be more loot here.

2680
01:47:32,110 --> 01:47:33,690
Okay, it just leads me back to the boss.

2681
01:47:33,830 --> 01:47:33,970
Okay.

2682
01:47:38,370 --> 01:47:39,750
Oh, there's two bosses.

2683
01:47:39,950 --> 01:47:40,250
Okay.

2684
01:47:40,710 --> 01:47:41,250
Oh, my God.

2685
01:47:41,370 --> 01:47:42,590
How do I get back down here?

2686
01:47:42,650 --> 01:47:43,750
I don't even remember.

2687
01:47:51,420 --> 01:47:51,820
Alright.

2688
01:47:53,880 --> 01:47:54,280
Try...

2689
01:47:57,240 --> 01:47:58,040
Wait, actually...

2690
01:48:02,440 --> 01:48:03,420
I did it.

2691
01:48:04,980 --> 01:48:07,080
This is the message to future Doki.

2692
01:48:10,720 --> 01:48:12,180
This is a message for her.

2693
01:48:12,340 --> 01:48:13,680
You got this, Doki.

2694
01:48:14,200 --> 01:48:15,620
You got this.

2695
01:48:17,620 --> 01:48:18,540
Wait, what?

2696
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:22,040
Oh, shit!

2697
01:48:25,360 --> 01:48:26,000
Okay.

2698
01:48:26,200 --> 01:48:27,360
Oh, it's a necromancer.

2699
01:48:30,100 --> 01:48:31,260
Oh, my God.

2700
01:48:31,380 --> 01:48:31,620
Oh, my God.

2701
01:48:35,130 --> 01:48:35,850
It's fine.

2702
01:48:36,110 --> 01:48:36,410
It's fine.

2703
01:48:37,130 --> 01:48:37,890
It's fine.

2704
01:48:38,090 --> 01:48:39,190
Oh, my God.

2705
01:48:39,410 --> 01:48:40,470
How are you so...

2706
01:48:40,470 --> 01:48:41,750
How is that so strong?

2707
01:48:42,770 --> 01:48:43,790
Holy shit!

2708
01:48:43,910 --> 01:48:44,830
How is that so strong?

2709
01:48:47,810 --> 01:48:49,130
You're supposed to be a nerd!

2710
01:48:49,330 --> 01:48:49,690
You don't have...

2711
01:48:49,690 --> 01:48:51,890
You're not supposed to have upper body strength!

2712
01:48:52,910 --> 01:48:54,130
Doesn't make sense!

2713
01:48:58,330 --> 01:49:00,430
How do you have upper body strength?

2714
01:49:03,330 --> 01:49:05,350
All you do is just magic!

2715
01:49:06,310 --> 01:49:07,050
Oh, my God.

2716
01:49:07,190 --> 01:49:08,390
All he does is roll, too.

2717
01:49:12,570 --> 01:49:13,770
Oh, my God.

2718
01:49:13,770 --> 01:49:13,890
Oh, my God.

2719
01:49:17,190 --> 01:49:18,290
Get out of here!

2720
01:49:20,810 --> 01:49:21,710
Holy shit!

2721
01:49:21,930 --> 01:49:22,950
Does he go to the gym?!

2722
01:49:25,390 --> 01:49:26,930
This nerd fucking works out.

2723
01:49:27,110 --> 01:49:28,050
Oh, my God!

2724
01:49:28,410 --> 01:49:29,950
This fucking nerd works out!

2725
01:49:33,110 --> 01:49:33,670
Fear!

2726
01:49:34,710 --> 01:49:35,450
Okay, we did it.

2727
01:49:37,610 --> 01:49:38,770
Oh, we did it.

2728
01:49:39,730 --> 01:49:42,330
I know he works out at the library.

2729
01:49:43,250 --> 01:49:44,370
Holy shit!

2730
01:49:48,420 --> 01:49:50,720
This nerd knows how to fucking flex.

2731
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:52,960
He's like the nerd that goes to the gym.

2732
01:49:55,020 --> 01:49:56,440
Still no whore.

2733
01:49:58,720 --> 01:49:59,780
I did it.

2734
01:50:00,640 --> 01:50:01,100
Uh...

2735
01:50:01,100 --> 01:50:03,120
I wanna return just to like get...

2736
01:50:03,120 --> 01:50:04,380
Okay, we have to go back.

2737
01:50:04,660 --> 01:50:06,100
Okay, we gotta figure out how to get back down.

2738
01:50:06,500 --> 01:50:07,240
We gotta...

2739
01:50:07,240 --> 01:50:08,120
I can't!

2740
01:50:08,240 --> 01:50:08,880
I can't!

2741
01:50:09,020 --> 01:50:10,100
Ran out of resources!

2742
01:50:12,260 --> 01:50:13,680
I have to go back.

2743
01:50:16,970 --> 01:50:18,370
So I can use the grace.

2744
01:50:21,310 --> 01:50:22,710
Cause I wanna level up.

2745
01:50:25,590 --> 01:50:26,050
Alright.

2746
01:50:26,410 --> 01:50:27,190
Never mind.

2747
01:50:27,390 --> 01:50:28,830
I guess I don't wanna level up.

2748
01:50:28,990 --> 01:50:29,870
Wait, do I have one more?

2749
01:50:29,870 --> 01:50:31,230
I do.

2750
01:50:31,610 --> 01:50:32,130
Oh, thank God.

2751
01:50:32,310 --> 01:50:32,450
Okay.

2752
01:50:32,730 --> 01:50:33,270
I can now.

2753
01:50:35,150 --> 01:50:36,870
Alright, time to figure out how I went downstairs.

2754
01:50:37,490 --> 01:50:38,990
I'm gonna figure out!

2755
01:50:40,250 --> 01:50:40,810
Alright.

2756
01:50:41,810 --> 01:50:42,670
What do we need?

2757
01:50:42,910 --> 01:50:44,230
Do we need more endurance chat?

2758
01:50:44,530 --> 01:50:45,510
Or dexterity?

2759
01:50:46,090 --> 01:50:47,050
Endurance or dexterity?

2760
01:50:47,870 --> 01:50:48,210
Guys.

2761
01:50:55,250 --> 01:50:55,810
Endurance?

2762
01:50:56,070 --> 01:50:56,330
Okay.

2763
01:50:59,470 --> 01:51:00,450
Endurance to 20.

2764
01:51:00,630 --> 01:51:00,850
Alright.

2765
01:51:00,850 --> 01:51:02,590
Let's figure out how to get back downstairs.

2766
01:51:05,970 --> 01:51:06,910
Ring, ring, ring.

2767
01:51:07,610 --> 01:51:08,310
Ring, ring.

2768
01:51:08,910 --> 01:51:10,310
Do the doors stay open forever?

2769
01:51:10,570 --> 01:51:11,050
Oh, they do.

2770
01:51:11,270 --> 01:51:11,510
Nice.

2771
01:51:14,630 --> 01:51:16,030
Let's get rid of him first.

2772
01:51:17,810 --> 01:51:18,510
Okay, wait.

2773
01:51:19,950 --> 01:51:21,290
Wait, I think I can make it.

2774
01:51:22,170 --> 01:51:22,890
Oh, okay.

2775
01:51:23,010 --> 01:51:23,450
Nevermind.

2776
01:51:25,930 --> 01:51:26,430
Nevermind.

2777
01:51:26,550 --> 01:51:27,650
I have to go this way.

2778
01:51:35,240 --> 01:51:36,700
Okay, this is not fair.

2779
01:51:37,020 --> 01:51:37,400
Cause like...

2780
01:51:38,140 --> 01:51:39,040
They're all there.

2781
01:51:44,720 --> 01:51:45,280
Oh!

2782
01:51:46,060 --> 01:51:46,620
That's...

2783
01:51:47,660 --> 01:51:49,440
That's how they all died.

2784
01:51:50,160 --> 01:51:51,600
Okay, I understand now.

2785
01:51:52,680 --> 01:51:53,420
Is this way?

2786
01:51:56,040 --> 01:51:56,900
It's this way.

2787
01:51:57,220 --> 01:51:57,600
Oh my god.

2788
01:51:57,640 --> 01:51:59,260
I almost didn't jump because I got...

2789
01:51:59,260 --> 01:51:59,600
I...

2790
01:51:59,600 --> 01:52:00,700
I didn't see it.

2791
01:52:02,020 --> 01:52:02,920
Alright, here we go.

2792
01:52:08,360 --> 01:52:09,360
Okay, where...

2793
01:52:09,360 --> 01:52:11,020
Where's the black knife assassin?

2794
01:52:11,800 --> 01:52:12,640
Where is he?

2795
01:52:14,420 --> 01:52:15,380
Where is he?

2796
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:18,420
Where is he?

2797
01:52:20,280 --> 01:52:21,340
Stupid octopus.

2798
01:52:21,640 --> 01:52:22,820
Stupid jellyfish.

2799
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:23,320
Where are you...

2800
01:52:23,320 --> 01:52:23,620
Oh!

2801
01:52:24,040 --> 01:52:24,380
No!

2802
01:52:30,140 --> 01:52:31,100
Okay.

2803
01:52:31,720 --> 01:52:32,020
Okay.

2804
01:52:40,200 --> 01:52:42,040
What the fuck?

2805
01:52:42,640 --> 01:52:43,460
Oh my god!

2806
01:52:45,460 --> 01:52:46,720
I was like...

2807
01:52:46,720 --> 01:52:48,120
Stupid jellyfish.

2808
01:52:48,220 --> 01:52:49,600
What are you trying to do?

2809
01:52:50,340 --> 01:52:50,900
Idiot?

2810
01:52:51,800 --> 01:52:52,360
I...

2811
01:52:52,360 --> 01:52:54,160
I was the idiot.

2812
01:52:56,380 --> 01:52:57,380
Oh my god.

2813
01:52:57,380 --> 01:52:58,240
He's invisible.

2814
01:53:00,780 --> 01:53:01,760
Where is he?

2815
01:53:01,960 --> 01:53:02,820
Oh, I see him.

2816
01:53:03,220 --> 01:53:03,960
Wait, do I?

2817
01:53:04,500 --> 01:53:05,640
Oh, I see him.

2818
01:53:06,440 --> 01:53:07,420
That's fucking right.

2819
01:53:07,700 --> 01:53:08,460
That's right.

2820
01:53:08,700 --> 01:53:09,580
I got you.

2821
01:53:09,860 --> 01:53:10,880
I got you now.

2822
01:53:11,700 --> 01:53:13,040
I see the water.

2823
01:53:13,860 --> 01:53:14,840
Oh, I see you.

2824
01:53:15,100 --> 01:53:15,500
Oh!

2825
01:53:15,600 --> 01:53:16,740
I don't see you!

2826
01:53:21,320 --> 01:53:22,800
This is so fucked up.

2827
01:53:27,130 --> 01:53:28,310
Oh my god!

2828
01:53:28,450 --> 01:53:29,130
Where are you?

2829
01:53:31,730 --> 01:53:32,370
Where is he?

2830
01:53:33,010 --> 01:53:33,730
Where is he?

2831
01:53:34,970 --> 01:53:35,770
He's over here.

2832
01:53:36,850 --> 01:53:37,290
Oh!

2833
01:53:37,550 --> 01:53:37,830
Nice!

2834
01:53:38,430 --> 01:53:39,850
Okay, I wasn't...

2835
01:53:39,850 --> 01:53:42,230
I didn't mean to do that, but that works out.

2836
01:53:42,430 --> 01:53:43,770
That actually works out for me.

2837
01:53:43,930 --> 01:53:44,790
Holy shit!

2838
01:53:45,130 --> 01:53:46,390
I didn't know that was his back.

2839
01:53:51,400 --> 01:53:52,180
Oh my god.

2840
01:53:52,280 --> 01:53:52,300
Oh my god.

2841
01:53:52,300 --> 01:53:52,800
He's not there.

2842
01:53:53,080 --> 01:53:53,720
He's okay.

2843
01:53:54,020 --> 01:53:55,980
The fucking ghosts are not helping.

2844
01:53:56,420 --> 01:53:58,700
The ghosts are actually not helping me.

2845
01:54:00,040 --> 01:54:03,800
Because I'm like trying to figure out where he is.

2846
01:54:03,940 --> 01:54:06,440
But then like the ghosts are just flying everywhere.

2847
01:54:06,740 --> 01:54:07,720
And then I'm lost.

2848
01:54:08,020 --> 01:54:09,400
Okay, I need to make sure I don't...

2849
01:54:09,400 --> 01:54:09,740
No!

2850
01:54:11,660 --> 01:54:12,640
Where are you?

2851
01:54:12,920 --> 01:54:13,340
No!

2852
01:54:17,070 --> 01:54:19,170
I'm trying not to show my back!

2853
01:54:19,450 --> 01:54:21,030
But I don't know where he is!

2854
01:54:30,400 --> 01:54:33,860
Because I'm thinking confused with Em- And the ghosts!

2855
01:54:40,240 --> 01:54:41,180
Oh my god.

2856
01:54:41,380 --> 01:54:43,880
Where are you fucking hitting my jellyfish?

2857
01:54:44,100 --> 01:54:44,640
Where?

2858
01:54:47,970 --> 01:54:48,950
He's over here.

2859
01:54:50,210 --> 01:54:51,130
Oh, he's over here.

2860
01:54:51,350 --> 01:54:52,290
I see you.

2861
01:54:54,710 --> 01:54:57,690
Oh, where's some water?

2862
01:54:58,590 --> 01:54:59,650
Oh my god he's...

2863
01:54:59,930 --> 01:55:01,450
Okay, right here.

2864
01:55:03,410 --> 01:55:03,850
You're right here.

2865
01:55:04,150 --> 01:55:05,010
You're right here.

2866
01:55:05,530 --> 01:55:06,530
That's fucking right.

2867
01:55:08,030 --> 01:55:08,510
Okay.

2868
01:55:08,950 --> 01:55:10,070
That's not fucking right.

2869
01:55:10,770 --> 01:55:14,170
Oh, he's looking for me, but I don't know where you are!

2870
01:55:15,630 --> 01:55:15,950
Okay.

2871
01:55:21,540 --> 01:55:22,300
There he is.

2872
01:55:22,860 --> 01:55:23,380
There he is.

2873
01:55:24,080 --> 01:55:24,860
That's right, I got you!

2874
01:55:25,240 --> 01:55:26,620
I got you!

2875
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:27,760
I got you, buddy!

2876
01:55:28,740 --> 01:55:29,580
Where is he?

2877
01:55:36,980 --> 01:55:37,540
Oh my god, there you are.

2878
01:55:37,980 --> 01:55:38,880
There you... What?

2879
01:55:39,220 --> 01:55:40,280
There you are.

2880
01:55:41,540 --> 01:55:43,220
There... Oh, there you are!

2881
01:55:43,360 --> 01:55:43,560
Yes!

2882
01:55:45,220 --> 01:55:48,240
It's like fucking... Where's Waldo?

2883
01:55:48,520 --> 01:55:50,720
Bro, that shit went so hard.

2884
01:55:51,300 --> 01:55:53,720
Okay, where's Waldo shit right there?

2885
01:55:54,260 --> 01:55:58,260
I... He's dead.

2886
01:55:58,520 --> 01:56:00,920
The evil has been defeated.

2887
01:56:01,340 --> 01:56:02,800
Oh my god.

2888
01:56:03,160 --> 01:56:04,540
A fucking coward.

2889
01:56:04,540 --> 01:56:07,380
This coward... Invisible shit.

2890
01:56:09,820 --> 01:56:12,100
Oh my god, we found him.

2891
01:56:12,320 --> 01:56:13,580
We found Waldo.

2892
01:56:14,200 --> 01:56:19,000
I look like... It's like some fucking... I'm fighting my inner demons right there.

2893
01:56:19,380 --> 01:56:20,560
Holy shit.

2894
01:56:24,480 --> 01:56:29,300
I would... If I had that ability, I would have done the same thing.

2895
01:56:30,580 --> 01:56:33,100
Holy fuck, that shit was crazy.

2896
01:56:35,280 --> 01:56:37,260
Are you sure he's real, Doki?

2897
01:56:37,480 --> 01:56:39,300
We don't... I don't know what you're talking about.

2898
01:56:40,060 --> 01:56:42,920
I don't see no black knife assassin.

2899
01:56:45,080 --> 01:56:46,180
Good job, Doki.

2900
01:56:46,320 --> 01:56:46,820
Way to go.

2901
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:48,460
Thank you for the super chat, Kuro.

2902
01:56:48,620 --> 01:56:49,720
Thank you, thank you.

2903
01:56:50,660 --> 01:56:52,200
Uh... Tanu, thank you for the super chat.

2904
01:56:52,300 --> 01:56:53,020
Thank you, thank you.

2905
01:56:53,080 --> 01:56:54,420
Just got your CPI bot, man.

2906
01:56:54,460 --> 01:56:56,200
I presume you haven't died up to now.

2907
01:56:56,200 --> 01:56:56,720
Yeah!

2908
01:56:57,120 --> 01:56:57,560
Zero deaths.

2909
01:56:57,780 --> 01:56:58,740
Thank you for the super chat.

2910
01:56:59,060 --> 01:56:59,700
Thank you.

2911
01:57:00,060 --> 01:57:00,300
Thank you.

2912
01:57:00,300 --> 01:57:00,300
See?

2913
01:57:00,540 --> 01:57:01,820
My title is not alive.

2914
01:57:02,400 --> 01:57:03,180
Zero deaths, guys.

2915
01:57:07,760 --> 01:57:09,900
Are you sure that was a boss fight, Doki?

2916
01:57:09,900 --> 01:57:10,920
We didn't see anything.

2917
01:57:15,840 --> 01:57:16,440
Alright.

2918
01:57:16,760 --> 01:57:18,340
Thank God we had jellyfish.

2919
01:57:20,480 --> 01:57:23,800
I knew she was gonna be the best summons in that game.

2920
01:57:26,120 --> 01:57:27,140
Look at that.

2921
01:57:27,520 --> 01:57:29,280
My tanky-ass jellyfish.

2922
01:57:31,360 --> 01:57:31,960
North?

2923
01:57:32,420 --> 01:57:33,420
Oh, this way?

2924
01:57:33,880 --> 01:57:34,460
Alright.

2925
01:57:35,540 --> 01:57:37,060
I have no idea where I'm going.

2926
01:57:40,120 --> 01:57:42,000
I'm just walking along.

2927
01:57:46,080 --> 01:57:46,600
Alright.

2928
01:57:46,920 --> 01:57:49,720
No, the deaths on the bottom left is my jellyfish.

2929
01:57:49,860 --> 01:57:51,960
That's how many times she's died, not me.

2930
01:57:57,980 --> 01:57:59,040
We'll go this way.

2931
01:58:03,850 --> 01:58:06,170
I'm just keeping track of her deaths, guys.

2932
01:58:07,490 --> 01:58:09,270
I should put my lantern on.

2933
01:58:14,480 --> 01:58:15,320
Anything here?

2934
01:58:15,540 --> 01:58:16,000
Oh, wait.

2935
01:58:16,500 --> 01:58:17,040
Can you?

2936
01:58:17,280 --> 01:58:18,340
Oh my gosh, fuck this.

2937
01:58:18,540 --> 01:58:19,320
I don't care about it.

2938
01:58:19,440 --> 01:58:19,960
Too much.

2939
01:58:21,420 --> 01:58:21,800
Oh.

2940
01:58:22,880 --> 01:58:24,240
Make sure there's nothing here.

2941
01:58:24,360 --> 01:58:25,140
Oh, is that a cave?

2942
01:58:26,400 --> 01:58:28,100
Oh no, it's just an indent and a wall.

2943
01:58:28,240 --> 01:58:28,640
Unless!

2944
01:58:29,300 --> 01:58:30,280
Okay, no, it's not.

2945
01:58:30,460 --> 01:58:32,220
It's just actually an indent in the wall.

2946
01:58:35,720 --> 01:58:36,120
Alright.

2947
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,140
I have no idea where the next story boss is.

2948
01:58:39,240 --> 01:58:41,040
I've just been walking around.

2949
01:58:47,410 --> 01:58:47,810
Alright.

2950
01:58:50,590 --> 01:58:51,770
I'll go this way.

2951
01:58:55,800 --> 01:58:57,040
It's a fake walls.

2952
01:58:58,520 --> 01:58:59,900
What the fuck?

2953
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:00,980
Okay.

2954
01:59:01,500 --> 01:59:02,560
Oh my god!

2955
01:59:04,980 --> 01:59:06,680
I don't have, I don't have anything.

2956
01:59:08,560 --> 01:59:09,340
Oh my god.

2957
01:59:09,420 --> 01:59:10,120
I can't use the map.

2958
01:59:10,300 --> 01:59:11,340
I can't use the map.

2959
01:59:11,560 --> 01:59:11,900
Okay.

2960
01:59:12,080 --> 01:59:12,340
Bye.

2961
01:59:17,820 --> 01:59:18,340
Goodbye.

2962
01:59:18,980 --> 01:59:19,680
Don't worry.

2963
01:59:19,780 --> 01:59:20,520
I'll come back to you.

2964
01:59:20,620 --> 01:59:21,500
I'll come back to you.

2965
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:22,060
I just...

2966
01:59:22,060 --> 01:59:24,020
I realized I don't have mana.

2967
01:59:24,640 --> 01:59:25,040
I...

2968
01:59:25,040 --> 01:59:25,740
Surprise.

2969
01:59:28,220 --> 01:59:28,760
Alright.

2970
01:59:31,020 --> 01:59:31,560
Alright.

2971
01:59:31,780 --> 01:59:33,160
Now, now, now go back.

2972
01:59:33,360 --> 01:59:33,520
Okay.

2973
01:59:33,880 --> 01:59:34,420
Okay.

2974
01:59:34,600 --> 01:59:34,800
Now.

2975
01:59:35,200 --> 01:59:36,880
Now we can fight.

2976
01:59:37,640 --> 01:59:38,160
Alright.

2977
01:59:40,720 --> 01:59:42,300
Now we can do this.

2978
01:59:45,160 --> 01:59:45,820
Just like, hey.

2979
01:59:45,960 --> 01:59:46,700
Did anyone call an Uber?

2980
01:59:50,600 --> 01:59:52,920
He felt like a fucking Uber dragon right there.

2981
01:59:53,280 --> 01:59:53,880
I was like, whoa.

2982
01:59:54,040 --> 01:59:55,000
I wonder how this guy died.

2983
01:59:55,480 --> 01:59:56,680
And then I realized how he died.

2984
01:59:59,440 --> 02:00:01,440
Because I think I know how this guy died.

2985
02:00:02,740 --> 02:00:03,580
Oh my god.

2986
02:00:03,580 --> 02:00:03,720
Holy shit.

2987
02:00:03,940 --> 02:00:04,100
Please.

2988
02:00:04,420 --> 02:00:06,040
You're using up all my frames.

2989
02:00:06,340 --> 02:00:06,500
Please.

2990
02:00:10,020 --> 02:00:11,140
Oh my god.

2991
02:00:11,420 --> 02:00:12,660
Oh my god.

2992
02:00:12,860 --> 02:00:16,480
My little guy already took half HP of damage.

2993
02:00:18,480 --> 02:00:19,600
Holy shit.

2994
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:23,280
Guys, are you sure this guy's mandatory?

2995
02:00:23,540 --> 02:00:24,340
Are you guys sure?

2996
02:00:24,340 --> 02:00:25,120
Are you...

2997
02:00:25,120 --> 02:00:27,780
Are you guys sure he's mandatory again?

2998
02:00:28,100 --> 02:00:29,240
Are you...

2999
02:00:29,240 --> 02:00:30,700
Oh my god.

3000
02:00:31,260 --> 02:00:33,380
Oh my god.

3001
02:00:35,280 --> 02:00:37,080
My CPU is crying.

3002
02:00:37,400 --> 02:00:39,360
My CPU is crying right now.

3003
02:00:39,820 --> 02:00:40,460
My...

3004
02:00:43,780 --> 02:00:45,280
Holy shit.

3005
02:00:49,710 --> 02:00:50,590
I can't.

3006
02:00:50,890 --> 02:00:52,370
Every hit is like...

3007
02:00:52,370 --> 02:00:53,710
My entire HP.

3008
02:00:56,890 --> 02:00:58,050
Oh my god.

3009
02:00:58,530 --> 02:01:00,370
Oh, I think he wants to kill me.

3010
02:01:00,990 --> 02:01:01,130
Wait.

3011
02:01:02,450 --> 02:01:04,350
Put out some asbestos.

3012
02:01:04,570 --> 02:01:05,070
Wait, he's dead.

3013
02:01:05,210 --> 02:01:05,590
He's gone.

3014
02:01:06,190 --> 02:01:06,670
Wait, what?

3015
02:01:06,910 --> 02:01:07,710
Where did he go?

3016
02:01:12,660 --> 02:01:13,180
Just...

3017
02:01:13,840 --> 02:01:14,560
That's it?

3018
02:01:16,080 --> 02:01:17,320
They ran away?

3019
02:01:18,320 --> 02:01:19,860
Oh, pussy bitch.

3020
02:01:20,180 --> 02:01:20,700
Look at that.

3021
02:01:20,960 --> 02:01:21,300
See?

3022
02:01:21,760 --> 02:01:22,820
Zero deaths, guys.

3023
02:01:23,500 --> 02:01:24,660
I did it.

3024
02:01:24,900 --> 02:01:27,160
It was just a prank.

3025
02:01:27,160 --> 02:01:28,210
It's like...

3026
02:01:29,620 --> 02:01:30,280
Pocket...

3027
02:01:30,280 --> 02:01:31,440
Asbestos.

3028
02:01:33,820 --> 02:01:35,020
I won, guys.

3029
02:01:35,280 --> 02:01:36,140
He ran away.

3030
02:01:36,380 --> 02:01:37,420
So that's a win.

3031
02:01:37,840 --> 02:01:38,840
For me.

3032
02:01:41,340 --> 02:01:43,560
He was the one that ran away.

3033
02:01:49,460 --> 02:01:50,270
You got bone?

3034
02:01:50,650 --> 02:01:51,910
Wait, they don't even have bone.

3035
02:01:58,970 --> 02:02:01,150
Toki, the accent wasn't your fault.

3036
02:02:01,350 --> 02:02:02,690
Let the dragon go.

3037
02:02:03,050 --> 02:02:03,390
Sorry.

3038
02:02:03,490 --> 02:02:04,550
Thank you for the super chat.

3039
02:02:04,710 --> 02:02:05,090
Thank you.

3040
02:02:05,290 --> 02:02:05,890
Thank you.

3041
02:02:08,100 --> 02:02:09,090
Alright, let's...

3042
02:02:09,090 --> 02:02:09,890
Get that grace.

3043
02:02:21,930 --> 02:02:22,510
Alright.

3044
02:02:23,670 --> 02:02:25,190
I don't think...

3045
02:02:25,190 --> 02:02:27,050
I don't think I'm like...

3046
02:02:27,050 --> 02:02:29,070
Near a story boss or anything.

3047
02:02:29,330 --> 02:02:29,650
I don't know.

3048
02:02:29,750 --> 02:02:31,650
It doesn't feel very story-esque.

3049
02:02:34,190 --> 02:02:34,710
Okay.

3050
02:02:34,830 --> 02:02:36,270
We need more bones for...

3051
02:02:36,890 --> 02:02:37,810
For arrows.

3052
02:02:38,110 --> 02:02:38,850
Because we're running out.

3053
02:02:40,310 --> 02:02:40,790
Okay.

3054
02:02:40,830 --> 02:02:42,590
Is there any shrine area yet?

3055
02:02:43,010 --> 02:02:45,570
Still don't know where to find a map for this place.

3056
02:02:47,710 --> 02:02:48,130
Uh...

3057
02:02:48,130 --> 02:02:49,570
Adam, thank you for the super chat.

3058
02:02:49,650 --> 02:02:49,970
Thank you!

3059
02:02:50,130 --> 02:02:50,670
Thank you!

3060
02:02:51,150 --> 02:02:52,250
Comes and slaps you.

3061
02:02:52,310 --> 02:02:52,930
Then runs away.

3062
02:02:53,170 --> 02:02:53,670
What a guy!

3063
02:02:53,930 --> 02:02:55,410
Thank you for the super chat!

3064
02:02:57,010 --> 02:03:12,710
There's a church past the wall.

3065
02:03:13,110 --> 02:03:13,410
What?

3066
02:03:13,470 --> 02:03:13,730
Is there?

3067
02:03:18,540 --> 02:03:20,320
I said I didn't find the church.

3068
02:03:21,760 --> 02:03:23,580
I got atoned for my sins.

3069
02:03:23,780 --> 02:03:24,480
Oh, there it is.

3070
02:03:24,620 --> 02:03:25,280
I see it.

3071
02:03:25,900 --> 02:03:27,960
I see the maiden watching me.

3072
02:03:28,480 --> 02:03:29,540
It's behind me.

3073
02:03:34,220 --> 02:03:35,220
Hello, maiden.

3074
02:03:37,640 --> 02:03:38,680
Oh, it's her!

3075
02:03:45,940 --> 02:03:47,740
Oh my god.

3076
02:03:48,960 --> 02:03:52,260
I knew you were a gamer the moment I laid my eyes on you.

3077
02:03:55,060 --> 02:03:55,920
Wait, what?

3078
02:03:56,540 --> 02:03:57,520
Or take your hand?

3079
02:03:58,040 --> 02:03:58,460
Whoa!

3080
02:03:59,500 --> 02:04:00,540
Holding hands?

3081
02:04:00,760 --> 02:04:01,780
Oh my gosh.

3082
02:04:03,100 --> 02:04:04,160
I should do it.

3083
02:04:07,060 --> 02:04:08,600
Give me your hand.

3084
02:04:08,840 --> 02:04:14,800
I will pray that you follow the same path as Lady Tanith.

3085
02:04:17,120 --> 02:04:18,240
Oh my god.

3086
02:04:18,620 --> 02:04:19,180
We're going...

3087
02:04:19,180 --> 02:04:21,560
Guys, we're going second base, guys!

3088
02:04:24,480 --> 02:04:25,120
Help!

3089
02:04:25,600 --> 02:04:25,780
Help!

3090
02:04:26,700 --> 02:04:27,840
Second base!

3091
02:04:31,340 --> 02:04:32,260
Oh shit.

3092
02:04:32,520 --> 02:04:33,440
Volcano Manor?

3093
02:04:33,640 --> 02:04:34,400
Where am I?

3094
02:04:37,920 --> 02:04:38,820
Oh my god.

3095
02:04:38,840 --> 02:04:40,120
She took me to another maiden.

3096
02:04:40,440 --> 02:04:41,340
She took me to a lady.

3097
02:04:42,660 --> 02:04:44,100
That's third base.

3098
02:04:44,260 --> 02:04:46,420
Inviting a second person.

3099
02:04:50,200 --> 02:04:51,960
Brave tarnished.

3100
02:04:52,960 --> 02:04:55,680
Welcome to the Volcano Manor.

3101
02:04:56,380 --> 02:04:59,880
I am Tanith, the proprietress of this house.

3102
02:05:00,660 --> 02:05:02,080
Raya spoke well of you.

3103
02:05:02,460 --> 02:05:04,480
A warrior of promise.

3104
02:05:05,180 --> 02:05:06,540
I believe she said.

3105
02:05:07,020 --> 02:05:09,760
Perhaps you are prepared to make a commitment.

3106
02:05:10,480 --> 02:05:12,940
Will you join us here at the Volcano Manor?

3107
02:05:13,620 --> 02:05:14,820
I mean, like...

3108
02:05:14,820 --> 02:05:15,940
I can't really leave now.

3109
02:05:15,940 --> 02:05:16,820
She took me here.

3110
02:05:16,960 --> 02:05:18,100
...burden of their grace.

3111
02:05:18,460 --> 02:05:22,120
Or be fooled by the dogmatic ramblings of the fingers.

3112
02:05:22,120 --> 02:05:23,720
First base, our eyes meet.

3113
02:05:23,900 --> 02:05:25,140
Second base, we hold hands.

3114
02:05:25,400 --> 02:05:26,800
Third base, she invites...

3115
02:05:26,800 --> 02:05:28,700
She invites a second person.

3116
02:05:31,720 --> 02:05:32,660
Oh my god.

3117
02:05:32,880 --> 02:05:33,560
And then...

3118
02:05:33,560 --> 02:05:34,700
And then a home run.

3119
02:05:34,960 --> 02:05:36,080
She proposes.

3120
02:05:37,820 --> 02:05:39,360
Papa Smurf, thank you for the super chat.

3121
02:05:39,460 --> 02:05:39,720
Thank you.

3122
02:05:39,880 --> 02:05:40,420
Thank you.

3123
02:05:41,040 --> 02:05:42,180
Wait, do we...

3124
02:05:42,180 --> 02:05:43,760
Join the Volcano Manor?

3125
02:05:45,900 --> 02:05:47,220
Join the evil team?

3126
02:05:47,420 --> 02:05:48,280
Jokey, don't.

3127
02:05:48,880 --> 02:05:49,320
Wait.

3128
02:05:49,640 --> 02:05:51,180
Is there any other teams I can join?

3129
02:05:56,940 --> 02:05:57,380
Join?

3130
02:05:57,580 --> 02:05:57,800
Okay.

3131
02:05:59,900 --> 02:06:01,000
Don't do it yet?

3132
02:06:01,180 --> 02:06:01,760
Wait, why not?

3133
02:06:02,180 --> 02:06:05,560
There's one guy that says, Don't do it yet.

3134
02:06:05,760 --> 02:06:06,900
We get one guy.

3135
02:06:11,800 --> 02:06:14,020
It doesn't affect anything.

3136
02:06:14,280 --> 02:06:14,420
Alright.

3137
02:06:16,480 --> 02:06:17,900
There's no downside.

3138
02:06:18,200 --> 02:06:18,360
Alright.

3139
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:19,080
Nice.

3140
02:06:23,740 --> 02:06:25,540
Do it for her.

3141
02:06:25,820 --> 02:06:26,300
Okay, cool.

3142
02:06:27,620 --> 02:06:29,020
Make yourself comfortable.

3143
02:06:29,840 --> 02:06:31,360
But be sure to earn your keep.

3144
02:06:33,060 --> 02:06:33,580
Ooh.

3145
02:06:34,200 --> 02:06:35,340
Look at the drawing room.

3146
02:06:35,660 --> 02:06:35,980
Hello.

3147
02:06:36,460 --> 02:06:37,180
Wait, can I stab?

3148
02:06:37,460 --> 02:06:38,640
No, I can't stab here.

3149
02:06:38,800 --> 02:06:40,200
The drawing room is through the hole.

3150
02:06:40,740 --> 02:06:41,060
Alright.

3151
02:06:42,680 --> 02:06:44,460
Guys, I can't believe it.

3152
02:06:44,660 --> 02:06:44,820
Shoot.

3153
02:06:45,100 --> 02:06:46,000
I did it.

3154
02:06:46,060 --> 02:06:47,260
I got a home run, chat.

3155
02:06:50,600 --> 02:06:52,480
I guess it's up top.

3156
02:06:56,660 --> 02:06:57,640
Oh my god.

3157
02:06:57,960 --> 02:06:59,020
Be wary of weak fill.

3158
02:06:59,160 --> 02:07:00,020
Wait, there's somebody here?

3159
02:07:02,240 --> 02:07:03,400
Time for rolling.

3160
02:07:03,680 --> 02:07:03,840
Woo!

3161
02:07:07,500 --> 02:07:08,880
Wait, where's the weak fill?

3162
02:07:09,560 --> 02:07:11,600
Oh, is he like...

3163
02:07:14,940 --> 02:07:16,660
Wait, can I summon?

3164
02:07:16,820 --> 02:07:17,480
Oh, no summons.

3165
02:07:17,660 --> 02:07:18,360
Oh my god.

3166
02:07:18,600 --> 02:07:19,720
Oh my god.

3167
02:07:19,860 --> 02:07:21,160
It's the fucking wheel.

3168
02:07:22,260 --> 02:07:23,960
I know this weapon.

3169
02:07:25,260 --> 02:07:26,280
Oh my god.

3170
02:07:26,500 --> 02:07:26,760
It's...

3171
02:07:27,440 --> 02:07:29,120
It's dead space all over again.

3172
02:07:29,840 --> 02:07:31,320
It's fucking dead space time.

3173
02:07:33,320 --> 02:07:34,520
Holy shit!

3174
02:07:35,100 --> 02:07:36,860
That does so much damage.

3175
02:07:37,720 --> 02:07:38,440
Pizza time.

3176
02:07:41,600 --> 02:07:42,160
Okay, it's fine.

3177
02:07:49,810 --> 02:07:51,150
What the fuck?

3178
02:07:52,810 --> 02:07:54,270
That's like one hit!

3179
02:07:58,840 --> 02:08:00,640
Yeah, I'm backing up after that.

3180
02:08:00,860 --> 02:08:01,040
Nice.

3181
02:08:03,080 --> 02:08:04,080
I know I'm faster.

3182
02:08:04,200 --> 02:08:05,200
Oh my god, never mind.

3183
02:08:09,400 --> 02:08:09,880
Okay.

3184
02:08:10,140 --> 02:08:11,400
I still know I'm faster though.

3185
02:08:12,480 --> 02:08:13,060
There we go.

3186
02:08:13,400 --> 02:08:13,960
There you go.

3187
02:08:13,980 --> 02:08:14,500
Pizza time.

3188
02:08:16,680 --> 02:08:17,400
That's right.

3189
02:08:17,600 --> 02:08:18,420
Give me your shit.

3190
02:08:18,940 --> 02:08:19,420
Yeah!

3191
02:08:22,800 --> 02:08:25,900
I tried to stand up on the table, but it wouldn't let me.

3192
02:08:26,580 --> 02:08:27,240
Likely clue.

3193
02:08:27,440 --> 02:08:28,280
Oh, is it the tree?

3194
02:08:31,860 --> 02:08:32,260
Alright.

3195
02:08:33,340 --> 02:08:33,920
That's right.

3196
02:08:34,120 --> 02:08:36,080
This time I knew for sure I'm faster.

3197
02:08:39,240 --> 02:08:41,200
I wish you could write your own message.

3198
02:08:42,200 --> 02:08:43,260
I'd be like pizza time.

3199
02:08:43,440 --> 02:08:45,320
I feel like everybody else would be like pizza time.

3200
02:08:45,840 --> 02:08:47,200
I-Fan, thank you for the super chat.

3201
02:08:47,280 --> 02:08:47,520
Thank you.

3202
02:08:47,640 --> 02:08:48,040
Thank you.

3203
02:08:48,220 --> 02:08:48,620
Dead Space.

3204
02:08:48,820 --> 02:08:50,360
This doesn't mean you're going to use the best weapon.

3205
02:08:50,480 --> 02:08:52,220
The Joplin gun again.

3206
02:08:52,720 --> 02:08:54,260
Thank you for the super chat.

3207
02:08:54,400 --> 02:08:55,180
I-Fan, thank you.

3208
02:08:55,320 --> 02:08:55,960
Thank you.

3209
02:08:58,900 --> 02:08:59,220
Wait.

3210
02:09:01,160 --> 02:09:02,620
She like took me to this room.

3211
02:09:02,760 --> 02:09:03,900
And I don't know where to go.

3212
02:09:05,160 --> 02:09:06,060
Door is locked.

3213
02:09:07,740 --> 02:09:09,480
Oh yeah, there's this room.

3214
02:09:13,490 --> 02:09:13,880
Oh.

3215
02:09:14,700 --> 02:09:15,460
Free stuff.

3216
02:09:16,300 --> 02:09:17,060
Try running.

3217
02:09:18,160 --> 02:09:19,080
Perfume bottles.

3218
02:09:20,240 --> 02:09:21,260
Likely enemy?

3219
02:09:21,840 --> 02:09:22,660
They're here.

3220
02:09:25,130 --> 02:09:25,900
Where the fuck?

3221
02:09:26,280 --> 02:09:26,780
Oh, there.

3222
02:09:28,180 --> 02:09:30,060
Why are there snails here?

3223
02:09:31,180 --> 02:09:32,800
A ripper is it?

3224
02:09:33,780 --> 02:09:34,400
No!

3225
02:09:35,240 --> 02:09:37,820
The crew says thank you for the...

3226
02:09:37,820 --> 02:09:40,520
Thank you for the Akasupa.

3227
02:09:40,880 --> 02:09:42,000
Thank you, thank you.

3228
02:09:42,300 --> 02:09:45,820
I forgot, was it like every Akasupa I like...

3229
02:09:45,820 --> 02:09:47,830
I like used like...

3230
02:09:48,400 --> 02:09:50,440
It's like one shot or some shit.

3231
02:09:50,800 --> 02:09:51,940
One ammo.

3232
02:09:53,080 --> 02:09:54,320
Oh my god.

3233
02:09:54,800 --> 02:09:56,120
That shit was...

3234
02:09:56,120 --> 02:09:56,700
Trauma.

3235
02:09:56,860 --> 02:09:57,620
Lover ahead.

3236
02:09:58,160 --> 02:09:59,020
Oh, where is she?

3237
02:10:02,960 --> 02:10:03,880
Likely distracted.

3238
02:10:04,240 --> 02:10:04,900
Wait, where is she?

3239
02:10:05,540 --> 02:10:07,460
I opened this door, where is she?

3240
02:10:07,920 --> 02:10:09,520
I couldn't memorize.

3241
02:10:10,540 --> 02:10:11,660
It was 10 blades.

3242
02:10:11,820 --> 02:10:12,700
Oh yeah, 10 blades.

3243
02:10:16,060 --> 02:10:17,220
Oh, not here yet.

3244
02:10:17,400 --> 02:10:18,240
I was gonna say...

3245
02:10:18,240 --> 02:10:19,230
Did she like...

3246
02:10:19,780 --> 02:10:21,100
Blake out on my date?

3247
02:10:23,100 --> 02:10:24,280
Oh hey, I got a finger.

3248
02:10:25,220 --> 02:10:26,240
Oh, and a letter.

3249
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:29,700
Where are you?

3250
02:10:32,040 --> 02:10:33,140
What name are you doing here?

3251
02:10:33,420 --> 02:10:34,840
The volcano...

3252
02:10:34,840 --> 02:10:35,740
I got invited.

3253
02:10:36,640 --> 02:10:38,340
Oh, she didn't pick you.

3254
02:10:38,620 --> 02:10:39,920
For the third person.

3255
02:10:40,180 --> 02:10:41,000
She picked me.

3256
02:10:41,360 --> 02:10:43,240
I hope you understand the weight of my words.

3257
02:10:45,140 --> 02:10:46,260
I don't understand.

3258
02:10:46,780 --> 02:10:48,360
Then you must leave immediately.

3259
02:10:48,740 --> 02:10:49,260
Oh, oops.

3260
02:10:49,520 --> 02:10:51,760
Those with weak stomachs have no place here.

3261
02:10:51,760 --> 02:10:52,660
Wait, I'm just stupid.

3262
02:10:53,260 --> 02:10:53,420
Wait.

3263
02:10:53,680 --> 02:10:54,440
Wait, I fucked up.

3264
02:10:55,760 --> 02:10:56,400
Wait.

3265
02:10:56,780 --> 02:10:57,420
Wait.

3266
02:10:57,920 --> 02:10:58,480
Wait.

3267
02:10:59,260 --> 02:10:59,760
Wait.

3268
02:10:59,760 --> 02:10:59,820
Wait.

3269
02:11:00,200 --> 02:11:00,520
Wait.

3270
02:11:00,520 --> 02:11:02,120
I thought he was gonna explain.

3271
02:11:02,880 --> 02:11:03,200
No.

3272
02:11:03,940 --> 02:11:04,760
Hello again.

3273
02:11:05,160 --> 02:11:05,800
Brave tarnished.

3274
02:11:05,800 --> 02:11:07,280
He was like, do you understand?

3275
02:11:07,620 --> 02:11:08,840
I was like, no, can you explain?

3276
02:11:09,280 --> 02:11:09,360
What?

3277
02:11:09,700 --> 02:11:10,900
I am pleased to see you again here.

3278
02:11:11,200 --> 02:11:12,420
I didn't think it was actually...

3279
02:11:12,420 --> 02:11:13,980
I thought choices don't matter.

3280
02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:15,480
Tarnished guidance.

3281
02:11:16,240 --> 02:11:18,740
May you tread the path of valor.

3282
02:11:21,320 --> 02:11:22,540
Brave tarnished.

3283
02:11:22,540 --> 02:11:23,180
I thought...

3284
02:11:23,180 --> 02:11:24,500
When the choices matter!

3285
02:11:25,020 --> 02:11:26,380
I thought I told you to leave.

3286
02:11:26,420 --> 02:11:27,280
I'm quite...

3287
02:11:27,280 --> 02:11:29,480
He didn't even let him finish.

3288
02:11:30,280 --> 02:11:31,940
When the choices matter!

3289
02:11:33,040 --> 02:11:33,600
Wait...

3290
02:11:37,280 --> 02:11:38,020
Don't worry.

3291
02:11:38,200 --> 02:11:38,840
He's gonna forget.

3292
02:11:39,060 --> 02:11:40,440
And then I can talk to him again.

3293
02:11:45,690 --> 02:11:46,490
Don't worry.

3294
02:11:49,090 --> 02:11:49,650
Okay.

3295
02:11:50,470 --> 02:11:51,410
I'll come back.

3296
02:11:51,530 --> 02:11:52,390
I understand now.

3297
02:11:52,590 --> 02:11:53,850
I thought I told you to leave.

3298
02:11:53,850 --> 02:11:59,170
What it means to be a recusant.

3299
02:11:59,630 --> 02:12:00,970
Renouncing grace.

3300
02:12:01,450 --> 02:12:02,910
And hunting down one's own.

3301
02:12:03,890 --> 02:12:04,970
Yes, I understand.

3302
02:12:04,990 --> 02:12:05,730
I'm sorry.

3303
02:12:05,950 --> 02:12:06,610
I was just...

3304
02:12:07,090 --> 02:12:08,770
I was just being a little stupid.

3305
02:12:13,030 --> 02:12:14,170
I'm sorry.

3306
02:12:23,110 --> 02:12:23,490
Yay!

3307
02:12:27,790 --> 02:12:28,910
There we go.

3308
02:12:32,680 --> 02:12:33,280
Alright.

3309
02:12:33,680 --> 02:12:35,920
Now we can go down the deep dark corridor.

3310
02:12:37,100 --> 02:12:37,840
Oh wait.

3311
02:12:37,960 --> 02:12:38,520
That's not it.

3312
02:12:40,740 --> 02:12:41,340
No.

3313
02:12:42,100 --> 02:12:42,700
Guys.

3314
02:12:42,760 --> 02:12:45,100
This can't be an evil manor.

3315
02:12:45,700 --> 02:12:48,420
Red is just a stylistic choice, guys.

3316
02:12:51,020 --> 02:12:52,340
Just a choice.

3317
02:12:54,100 --> 02:12:55,980
Oh, they're like evil snails.

3318
02:12:55,980 --> 02:12:57,380
They're like evil snails.

3319
02:13:02,260 --> 02:13:02,700
Okay.

3320
02:13:02,940 --> 02:13:03,900
We'll read the letters soon.

3321
02:13:03,900 --> 02:13:05,260
I just wanna kill these guys first.

3322
02:13:06,160 --> 02:13:10,240
I just wanna make sure there's nothing here before I read the letter.

3323
02:13:10,620 --> 02:13:10,760
Alright.

3324
02:13:10,800 --> 02:13:11,500
Where's this letter?

3325
02:13:14,080 --> 02:13:14,480
Okay.

3326
02:13:14,480 --> 02:13:15,960
As we're in a request, old...

3327
02:13:15,960 --> 02:13:17,840
He can be found in Limgrave.

3328
02:13:17,960 --> 02:13:20,680
Find the red mark on your map for the exact location.

3329
02:13:20,860 --> 02:13:21,060
Okay.

3330
02:13:23,220 --> 02:13:24,820
Yeah, they're not evil snakes.

3331
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:25,500
They're stylistically...

3332
02:13:27,320 --> 02:13:28,460
It's just a choice.

3333
02:13:36,500 --> 02:13:38,100
Get rid of these guys first.

3334
02:13:39,080 --> 02:13:42,360
Let's try not to use up all my mana in case there is a boss.

3335
02:13:45,500 --> 02:13:46,220
Oh nice.

3336
02:13:46,420 --> 02:13:46,760
A cookbook.

3337
02:13:47,940 --> 02:13:48,680
Just in case.

3338
02:13:48,680 --> 02:13:49,460
I knew it.

3339
02:13:49,540 --> 02:13:50,320
I knew it.

3340
02:13:50,540 --> 02:13:52,640
I knew you were not real.

3341
02:13:57,760 --> 02:13:58,460
Oh wait.

3342
02:13:58,640 --> 02:13:58,720
What?

3343
02:13:59,940 --> 02:14:01,000
Did I kill you?

3344
02:14:03,680 --> 02:14:04,640
Wait, are...

3345
02:14:04,640 --> 02:14:05,880
Do you have to double kill you?

3346
02:14:06,020 --> 02:14:06,300
No.

3347
02:14:06,740 --> 02:14:07,680
Okay, they just showed up.

3348
02:14:10,660 --> 02:14:11,580
There's an item?

3349
02:14:16,080 --> 02:14:17,500
Oh, there it is.

3350
02:14:17,700 --> 02:14:18,060
Oh!

3351
02:14:18,840 --> 02:14:19,340
Whoops.

3352
02:14:22,320 --> 02:14:23,700
There's your chest ahead?

3353
02:14:24,060 --> 02:14:25,160
I can't open the door.

3354
02:14:29,100 --> 02:14:29,980
What do you mean?

3355
02:14:31,960 --> 02:14:33,520
I can't even open this door.

3356
02:14:41,100 --> 02:14:42,520
Oh, I don't have the right.

3357
02:14:42,720 --> 02:14:42,860
Okay.

3358
02:14:46,040 --> 02:14:47,320
Nice, I got more arrows.

3359
02:14:47,700 --> 02:14:48,760
This has to be fake.

3360
02:14:49,360 --> 02:14:50,160
Wait, it's not?

3361
02:14:51,180 --> 02:14:51,980
What the fuck?

3362
02:14:52,240 --> 02:14:53,580
Oh my god, that's a bait.

3363
02:14:58,940 --> 02:15:00,460
Alright, now we go down.

3364
02:15:02,700 --> 02:15:05,060
Said there was a boss, but like, you lied.

3365
02:15:05,400 --> 02:15:06,400
Where's your boss here?

3366
02:15:10,300 --> 02:15:11,140
Message ahead.

3367
02:15:12,840 --> 02:15:14,140
Strong foe ahead.

3368
02:15:14,400 --> 02:15:14,440
Strong foe ahead.

3369
02:15:14,440 --> 02:15:16,340
Oh wait, I think this is...

3370
02:15:16,340 --> 02:15:18,800
I think that's where the boss is.

3371
02:15:22,960 --> 02:15:24,220
Oh, there he is.

3372
02:15:27,280 --> 02:15:28,940
Okay, but what if I just do...

3373
02:15:34,080 --> 02:15:34,600
Okay.

3374
02:15:37,120 --> 02:15:37,640
Whoops.

3375
02:15:43,700 --> 02:15:44,680
I mean, not bad.

3376
02:15:45,020 --> 02:15:45,580
Look at that.

3377
02:15:45,940 --> 02:15:46,220
See?

3378
02:15:46,980 --> 02:15:47,340
Oh!

3379
02:15:48,280 --> 02:15:49,760
Wait, I don't think he can make it through.

3380
02:15:53,040 --> 02:15:54,180
Yeah, I think he's too thick.

3381
02:15:54,860 --> 02:15:55,380
Look, see?

3382
02:15:56,740 --> 02:15:58,000
Oh yeah, he's definitely too thick.

3383
02:15:58,120 --> 02:15:58,480
Look at him.

3384
02:16:01,140 --> 02:16:02,480
Ha ha ha ha!

3385
02:16:02,860 --> 02:16:03,720
Ha ha ha ha!

3386
02:16:04,220 --> 02:16:04,780
Ha ha ha!

3387
02:16:04,780 --> 02:16:05,700
Can't do anything!

3388
02:16:06,160 --> 02:16:06,400
Ha ha!

3389
02:16:06,520 --> 02:16:07,060
Boy stuck!

3390
02:16:07,740 --> 02:16:08,400
He's stuck!

3391
02:16:08,680 --> 02:16:09,300
Look at him!

3392
02:16:09,660 --> 02:16:10,160
Ha ha ha!

3393
02:16:10,480 --> 02:16:11,320
He's so stuck!

3394
02:16:12,040 --> 02:16:13,380
I got the range!

3395
02:16:13,740 --> 02:16:14,240
You're too thick!

3396
02:16:14,520 --> 02:16:14,720
Boy!

3397
02:16:16,580 --> 02:16:17,140
Oh!

3398
02:16:19,440 --> 02:16:20,740
You're still too thick!

3399
02:16:21,660 --> 02:16:22,480
That's right!

3400
02:16:22,960 --> 02:16:24,660
Can't do anything about that!

3401
02:16:24,940 --> 02:16:25,280
Ha ha!

3402
02:16:26,940 --> 02:16:28,740
That TP all you want!

3403
02:16:28,960 --> 02:16:29,380
You're stuck!

3404
02:16:30,360 --> 02:16:31,720
How you gonna get through?

3405
02:16:34,980 --> 02:16:35,300
Okay.

3406
02:16:35,840 --> 02:16:37,600
I'm a little worried though.

3407
02:16:39,800 --> 02:16:40,820
Ha ha ha!

3408
02:16:41,580 --> 02:16:42,040
Faded!

3409
02:16:42,240 --> 02:16:43,160
Get faded, bitch!

3410
02:16:44,280 --> 02:16:46,040
Get fucking faded!

3411
02:16:46,880 --> 02:16:47,600
Ha ha ha!

3412
02:16:48,260 --> 02:16:48,580
Whoa!

3413
02:16:49,240 --> 02:16:50,100
Oh shit!

3414
02:16:52,200 --> 02:16:53,660
That's okay, I'm okay, guys.

3415
02:16:54,660 --> 02:16:55,760
Still too thick.

3416
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:56,580
Oh!

3417
02:16:57,380 --> 02:16:57,700
Okay!

3418
02:16:57,960 --> 02:16:58,780
Uppercut it!

3419
02:16:59,240 --> 02:17:01,260
When he's never uppercut it before!

3420
02:17:01,940 --> 02:17:02,700
Holy shit!

3421
02:17:03,340 --> 02:17:04,620
What the fuck!

3422
02:17:07,860 --> 02:17:09,080
Okay, let me...

3423
02:17:09,840 --> 02:17:11,080
Okay, that's awkward.

3424
02:17:13,080 --> 02:17:13,680
What?!

3425
02:17:13,680 --> 02:17:15,420
How is he faster?!

3426
02:17:20,270 --> 02:17:21,310
Oh my god.

3427
02:17:21,530 --> 02:17:21,910
I don't know.

3428
02:17:22,350 --> 02:17:23,930
He's so much faster than me.

3429
02:17:30,980 --> 02:17:33,160
He's so much faster!

3430
02:17:33,620 --> 02:17:35,080
He does the counter!

3431
02:17:37,500 --> 02:17:38,560
It's okay.

3432
02:17:40,260 --> 02:17:42,660
Raise your hands, dragoons!

3433
02:17:42,800 --> 02:17:44,360
Give me your strength!

3434
02:17:45,700 --> 02:17:49,140
Give me your strength, dragoons!

3435
02:17:50,200 --> 02:17:51,280
Oh my god.

3436
02:17:51,280 --> 02:17:52,040
It's right here.

3437
02:17:52,200 --> 02:17:52,320
Okay.

3438
02:17:52,320 --> 02:17:53,380
This is like...

3439
02:17:53,380 --> 02:17:54,520
I know like...

3440
02:17:54,520 --> 02:17:55,440
Where his range is.

3441
02:17:55,580 --> 02:17:56,020
Cause like...

3442
02:17:56,020 --> 02:17:57,380
This is where his range is.

3443
02:17:57,720 --> 02:17:58,080
Thank you.

3444
02:17:58,500 --> 02:17:59,340
Ha ha ha ha ha!

3445
02:18:02,060 --> 02:18:04,220
So, as long as I'm...

3446
02:18:04,220 --> 02:18:06,320
Behind this red stain...

3447
02:18:07,040 --> 02:18:08,920
We should be fine.

3448
02:18:13,870 --> 02:18:14,790
Here we go.

3449
02:18:17,550 --> 02:18:18,810
Are you serious?!

3450
02:18:18,810 --> 02:18:19,890
He hits first?!

3451
02:18:24,050 --> 02:18:25,310
Oh my god!

3452
02:18:25,310 --> 02:18:26,170
He jumped!

3453
02:18:30,200 --> 02:18:30,720
Okay.

3454
02:18:31,460 --> 02:18:32,020
It's fine.

3455
02:18:34,280 --> 02:18:34,800
Okay.

3456
02:18:35,080 --> 02:18:36,440
We got the cheese though.

3457
02:18:36,680 --> 02:18:38,000
We got the cheese.

3458
02:18:39,220 --> 02:18:39,980
It's alright.

3459
02:18:40,540 --> 02:18:41,300
That's it.

3460
02:18:41,780 --> 02:18:43,240
I know what to do.

3461
02:18:43,400 --> 02:18:43,620
Okay.

3462
02:18:43,760 --> 02:18:44,560
I don't have any left.

3463
02:18:45,020 --> 02:18:45,380
I...

3464
02:18:45,380 --> 02:18:45,560
Wait.

3465
02:18:45,720 --> 02:18:46,800
Do I not have any?

3466
02:18:46,980 --> 02:18:47,200
Okay.

3467
02:18:47,220 --> 02:18:48,580
I know what to do, guys.

3468
02:18:49,080 --> 02:18:49,960
I've learned.

3469
02:18:54,150 --> 02:18:54,970
Watch this.

3470
02:18:56,190 --> 02:18:56,710
Okay.

3471
02:18:56,750 --> 02:18:57,850
He has to get close to me.

3472
02:18:58,910 --> 02:19:00,050
Oh my god.

3473
02:19:00,230 --> 02:19:00,550
Please.

3474
02:19:03,350 --> 02:19:04,430
This is not fair.

3475
02:19:04,730 --> 02:19:05,110
Please.

3476
02:19:05,290 --> 02:19:06,210
Just stand in front.

3477
02:19:08,070 --> 02:19:09,530
Stand in front of me!

3478
02:19:10,530 --> 02:19:11,210
There you go.

3479
02:19:15,340 --> 02:19:16,120
Can't dodge this.

3480
02:19:16,660 --> 02:19:17,540
Can't dodge this!

3481
02:19:17,880 --> 02:19:18,640
That's right!

3482
02:19:19,100 --> 02:19:19,620
Oh.

3483
02:19:19,740 --> 02:19:20,740
I used it all up.

3484
02:19:21,200 --> 02:19:21,500
Okay.

3485
02:19:21,720 --> 02:19:22,280
One more hit.

3486
02:19:25,620 --> 02:19:26,500
There we go.

3487
02:19:26,580 --> 02:19:27,260
We did it!

3488
02:19:27,860 --> 02:19:30,860
The most badass fight of all time.

3489
02:19:33,240 --> 02:19:38,220
The most engaging, exciting fight we've ever seen.

3490
02:19:41,080 --> 02:19:41,680
Okay.

3491
02:19:41,860 --> 02:19:42,500
Time for Grace.

3492
02:19:42,660 --> 02:19:43,780
Oh, there's a Grace in front of me.

3493
02:19:44,120 --> 02:19:44,460
Nice.

3494
02:19:48,300 --> 02:19:50,960
What an epic battle, guys.

3495
02:19:51,240 --> 02:19:52,720
It was so engaging.

3496
02:19:56,120 --> 02:19:56,960
Okay.

3497
02:19:57,300 --> 02:19:58,380
That was the liar.

3498
02:19:59,280 --> 02:20:00,080
Let me...

3499
02:20:00,080 --> 02:20:02,780
Let me vote that as poor.

3500
02:20:03,160 --> 02:20:06,420
And then vote this as good.

3501
02:20:10,800 --> 02:20:17,280
I don't know if I got tricked, everyone shall get tricked.

3502
02:20:22,800 --> 02:20:26,740
Everyone must make the same mistake as me!

3503
02:20:28,260 --> 02:20:29,320
I don't know.

3504
02:20:29,480 --> 02:20:29,900
Oh, I do.

3505
02:20:30,240 --> 02:20:30,540
Okay.

3506
02:20:30,720 --> 02:20:31,920
We get entrance up.

3507
02:20:33,300 --> 02:20:35,100
The cycle never ends!

3508
02:20:36,640 --> 02:20:39,960
We could say it was a Gouda fight without cheese it was.

3509
02:20:40,120 --> 02:20:41,560
Duck, thank you for the super chat.

3510
02:20:41,700 --> 02:20:42,640
Thank you, thank you.

3511
02:20:45,560 --> 02:20:47,520
We continue the cycle!

3512
02:20:48,140 --> 02:20:48,960
Where am I?

3513
02:20:49,340 --> 02:20:50,500
Oh, this is our house.

3514
02:20:56,260 --> 02:20:58,440
Welcome to the Legacy Dungeon?

3515
02:20:59,700 --> 02:21:00,640
What's that mean?

3516
02:21:02,100 --> 02:21:03,200
Visions of Head.

3517
02:21:03,980 --> 02:21:05,920
Okay, I soon went to go to that area.

3518
02:21:10,020 --> 02:21:11,340
Alright, I guess I go down.

3519
02:21:16,900 --> 02:21:17,980
Cause I don't know...

3520
02:21:17,980 --> 02:21:17,980
Oh!

3521
02:21:18,240 --> 02:21:18,760
What the fuck?

3522
02:21:18,900 --> 02:21:20,400
Oh, is this where the Magma Worm is?

3523
02:21:22,200 --> 02:21:23,240
Like, he's so alive.

3524
02:21:25,880 --> 02:21:27,180
What was he calling for?

3525
02:21:31,330 --> 02:21:33,270
Wait, is his friend supposed to come over?

3526
02:21:33,530 --> 02:21:35,090
Like, what was he calling for?

3527
02:21:38,050 --> 02:21:40,510
Oh my god, there's so many people on the roofs.

3528
02:21:42,970 --> 02:21:44,170
There's a lever somewhere.

3529
02:21:44,330 --> 02:21:44,930
I don't remember where.

3530
02:21:45,170 --> 02:21:45,670
But it's there.

3531
02:21:47,750 --> 02:21:48,830
There's someone here.

3532
02:21:49,070 --> 02:21:50,210
And there's someone to my right.

3533
02:21:50,430 --> 02:21:51,710
Oh, there's dogs here.

3534
02:21:52,530 --> 02:21:53,530
Oh, you know what?

3535
02:21:53,750 --> 02:21:54,210
Fuck this.

3536
02:21:54,790 --> 02:21:54,990
Fuck.

3537
02:21:56,890 --> 02:21:57,770
There you go.

3538
02:21:58,990 --> 02:22:00,410
Yeah, I'm not dealing with that.

3539
02:22:01,010 --> 02:22:01,470
You can.

3540
02:22:01,470 --> 02:22:01,550
Man.

3541
02:22:02,850 --> 02:22:04,310
I don't wanna deal with dogs.

3542
02:22:05,050 --> 02:22:05,750
Right now.

3543
02:22:05,990 --> 02:22:07,330
You got this jellyfish.

3544
02:22:09,330 --> 02:22:10,470
Oh my god.

3545
02:22:10,650 --> 02:22:11,690
Okay, you still got this.

3546
02:22:12,250 --> 02:22:13,110
I believe in you.

3547
02:22:13,270 --> 02:22:15,150
Block, body, block, block all of this.

3548
02:22:19,110 --> 02:22:19,550
Okay.

3549
02:22:22,430 --> 02:22:24,950
Okay, maybe the jellyfish was a little overkill.

3550
02:22:25,210 --> 02:22:25,430
Maybe.

3551
02:22:29,190 --> 02:22:31,630
I don't think we needed the jellyfish, guys.

3552
02:22:33,370 --> 02:22:35,680
It could have been a little bit of an overkill.

3553
02:22:40,160 --> 02:22:41,580
You wear a lovable sword?

3554
02:22:42,220 --> 02:22:42,720
Where?

3555
02:22:43,520 --> 02:22:44,380
Oh, him?

3556
02:22:45,580 --> 02:22:46,440
Oh, wait.

3557
02:22:46,660 --> 02:22:47,560
Isn't that the...

3558
02:22:51,850 --> 02:22:52,390
Oh!

3559
02:22:52,570 --> 02:22:53,730
I saw this on!

3560
02:22:53,850 --> 02:22:54,950
I saw this on!

3561
02:22:55,110 --> 02:22:56,050
Elden Ring Shorts!

3562
02:22:56,790 --> 02:22:58,890
Come over here, baby.

3563
02:22:59,250 --> 02:23:01,250
I'm looking for a good time.

3564
02:23:02,050 --> 02:23:03,210
Yeah, come on.

3565
02:23:03,410 --> 02:23:04,430
I'm looking for a...

3566
02:23:04,430 --> 02:23:04,730
Oh!

3567
02:23:05,150 --> 02:23:05,290
Shit!

3568
02:23:08,010 --> 02:23:09,790
Come on, baby.

3569
02:23:11,490 --> 02:23:13,310
Put me inside you!

3570
02:23:14,710 --> 02:23:15,510
Come on!

3571
02:23:16,010 --> 02:23:16,610
Eat me!

3572
02:23:17,650 --> 02:23:18,110
Yeah!

3573
02:23:19,710 --> 02:23:21,170
Let me in!

3574
02:23:21,430 --> 02:23:22,250
Let me in!

3575
02:23:23,190 --> 02:23:25,670
This was in my Elden Ring Shorts!

3576
02:23:29,370 --> 02:23:30,830
Let me in!

3577
02:23:31,430 --> 02:23:33,030
Let me in!

3578
02:23:34,130 --> 02:23:35,830
Come on, girl!

3579
02:23:37,130 --> 02:23:39,050
I can rock your world!

3580
02:23:39,910 --> 02:23:41,410
Open that mouth up!

3581
02:23:41,750 --> 02:23:42,270
Oh, shit!

3582
02:23:44,610 --> 02:23:45,950
Wait, not in this area?

3583
02:23:46,110 --> 02:23:46,730
Oh, shit!

3584
02:23:47,030 --> 02:23:47,750
Okay, goodbye!

3585
02:23:52,080 --> 02:23:52,760
Apparently...

3586
02:23:52,760 --> 02:23:54,440
Apparently it's not here.

3587
02:23:54,820 --> 02:23:56,000
Sorry, wrong one!

3588
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:57,100
Wrong one!

3589
02:23:57,300 --> 02:23:57,600
I was...

3590
02:23:57,600 --> 02:23:58,800
I'm looking for someone else!

3591
02:23:58,920 --> 02:23:59,600
I'm looking for Jenny!

3592
02:24:04,710 --> 02:24:07,510
This one just kills you, Toki!

3593
02:24:07,510 --> 02:24:10,690
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

3594
02:24:11,330 --> 02:24:12,930
Can I, like...

3595
02:24:12,930 --> 02:24:13,270
Whoa!

3596
02:24:14,930 --> 02:24:16,950
It's a different Samoyed!

3597
02:24:18,770 --> 02:24:19,850
Jesus Christ.

3598
02:24:24,650 --> 02:24:25,490
It's fine.

3599
02:24:26,710 --> 02:24:27,250
Sorry.

3600
02:24:27,610 --> 02:24:28,790
I was looking for Jenny.

3601
02:24:35,690 --> 02:24:36,070
Whoops.

3602
02:24:36,970 --> 02:24:39,990
No, I, like, saw it in my Elden Ring...

3603
02:24:39,990 --> 02:24:42,190
Like, it was in my Elden Ring Shorts algorithm.

3604
02:24:43,070 --> 02:24:43,910
Because for some...

3605
02:24:43,910 --> 02:24:46,690
I'm getting, like, Elden Ring stuff now for my Shorts algorithm.

3606
02:24:46,690 --> 02:24:52,170
And it was like, oh, if you wanna get this weapon, you just have to get eaten by an Iron Maiden.

3607
02:24:52,970 --> 02:24:53,850
In the...

3608
02:24:53,850 --> 02:24:55,210
Volcano Manor.

3609
02:24:55,210 --> 02:24:56,770
And I was like, there she is.

3610
02:24:57,910 --> 02:24:58,750
I'm ready.

3611
02:24:59,210 --> 02:24:59,630
Oh!

3612
02:25:00,050 --> 02:25:00,150
Fuck!

3613
02:25:00,350 --> 02:25:01,010
Not for that!

3614
02:25:06,330 --> 02:25:08,830
That's not what I meant when I said I'm ready.

3615
02:25:10,990 --> 02:25:11,550
Jesus!

3616
02:25:11,990 --> 02:25:12,490
Jesus!

3617
02:25:12,770 --> 02:25:13,090
No!

3618
02:25:18,070 --> 02:25:18,630
No!

3619
02:25:18,630 --> 02:25:19,750
My Ravens!

3620
02:25:26,430 --> 02:25:26,910
Alright.

3621
02:25:27,470 --> 02:25:27,930
Okay.

3622
02:25:28,390 --> 02:25:30,470
Let me figure out how to get my shit back.

3623
02:25:33,350 --> 02:25:34,730
Oh, there he goes again.

3624
02:25:35,790 --> 02:25:37,510
How can I backstab this guy?

3625
02:25:38,730 --> 02:25:40,010
Alright, get down from there.

3626
02:25:42,490 --> 02:25:43,930
Okay, okay, my runes...

3627
02:25:43,930 --> 02:25:44,990
Oh, thank God it's above.

3628
02:25:45,330 --> 02:25:46,450
Thank God it's up there.

3629
02:25:46,610 --> 02:25:46,870
Okay.

3630
02:25:47,270 --> 02:25:47,730
That's good.

3631
02:25:48,190 --> 02:25:49,830
That's actually really good for me.

3632
02:25:59,560 --> 02:26:01,900
I don't know how I whiffed that, but that's okay.

3633
02:26:03,080 --> 02:26:04,180
Where do I go?

3634
02:26:04,720 --> 02:26:06,120
This area is so...

3635
02:26:06,120 --> 02:26:06,960
Oh, shit.

3636
02:26:07,340 --> 02:26:09,540
There's so much stuff here.

3637
02:26:11,240 --> 02:26:11,760
No!

3638
02:26:12,460 --> 02:26:12,980
What?!

3639
02:26:12,980 --> 02:26:13,620
What?!

3640
02:26:13,620 --> 02:26:15,100
Did you just do that?!

3641
02:26:15,100 --> 02:26:16,260
Where did he go?

3642
02:26:17,520 --> 02:26:18,600
Well, he just disappeared.

3643
02:26:19,340 --> 02:26:21,560
He like, ate me and then left.

3644
02:26:21,700 --> 02:26:22,700
He's like, I did my job.

3645
02:26:25,440 --> 02:26:27,820
He's like, oh, I thought you wanted a good time.

3646
02:26:27,820 --> 02:26:29,140
He's like, I'm Jenny.

3647
02:26:36,020 --> 02:26:37,860
Wait, he's like, didn't you ask for Jenny?

3648
02:26:38,100 --> 02:26:38,500
That's me.

3649
02:26:43,500 --> 02:26:43,960
Yeah.

3650
02:26:49,170 --> 02:26:50,710
I actually don't know where to go.

3651
02:26:55,390 --> 02:26:56,130
Go here?

3652
02:26:56,290 --> 02:26:57,050
Oh, maybe here.

3653
02:26:57,310 --> 02:26:58,230
Oh, it's here.

3654
02:26:59,670 --> 02:27:00,650
I'm pretty sure.

3655
02:27:02,550 --> 02:27:04,430
Cause it's like, there's stairs up here.

3656
02:27:05,210 --> 02:27:06,990
I still have to go to this castle.

3657
02:27:12,630 --> 02:27:14,150
Okay, I think I made it.

3658
02:27:14,550 --> 02:27:15,090
Jesus Christ.

3659
02:27:15,290 --> 02:27:16,250
Okay, I just take that.

3660
02:27:17,750 --> 02:27:19,950
Try fall, but zero deaths.

3661
02:27:20,350 --> 02:27:22,550
Thank you for the super chat laughing.

3662
02:27:22,850 --> 02:27:23,850
Thank you, thank you.

3663
02:27:28,220 --> 02:27:29,440
Guys, that doesn't count.

3664
02:27:29,640 --> 02:27:32,140
Because technically, like, I didn't die to an enemy.

3665
02:27:34,280 --> 02:27:35,240
Jenny?

3666
02:27:35,240 --> 02:27:35,780
And...

3667
02:27:35,780 --> 02:27:36,640
Okay, let's use it.

3668
02:27:41,240 --> 02:27:42,740
Yeah, I can't get...

3669
02:27:42,740 --> 02:27:43,660
Wait, is it her?

3670
02:27:47,420 --> 02:27:47,900
Jenny?

3671
02:27:52,360 --> 02:27:53,940
Wait, let me...

3672
02:27:54,940 --> 02:27:55,780
Jenny?

3673
02:27:56,340 --> 02:27:57,420
Is that you?

3674
02:27:58,420 --> 02:27:59,300
No.

3675
02:27:59,300 --> 02:27:59,320
No.

3676
02:28:03,020 --> 02:28:04,680
Where will I find Jenny?

3677
02:28:08,540 --> 02:28:09,500
Behold ladder.

3678
02:28:15,240 --> 02:28:16,020
Wait, what?

3679
02:28:16,980 --> 02:28:18,360
Wait, why she got mad?

3680
02:28:19,800 --> 02:28:20,440
Wait, what?

3681
02:28:20,680 --> 02:28:21,400
Oh my god.

3682
02:28:21,920 --> 02:28:22,480
Oh my god.

3683
02:28:22,740 --> 02:28:23,440
Wait, I thought...

3684
02:28:23,440 --> 02:28:24,680
I thought she was friendly!

3685
02:28:24,840 --> 02:28:26,100
They said she was friendly!

3686
02:28:30,860 --> 02:28:32,200
Oh, is that any good?

3687
02:28:37,420 --> 02:28:38,460
Let's go here.

3688
02:28:40,480 --> 02:28:41,640
Actually, I wanna...

3689
02:28:41,640 --> 02:28:42,960
Grab this XP anyway.

3690
02:28:43,960 --> 02:28:44,540
Might as well.

3691
02:28:44,720 --> 02:28:46,740
Yeah, they do 300, so they're pretty good.

3692
02:28:47,260 --> 02:28:48,380
But I don't think Jenny knows...

3693
02:28:48,380 --> 02:28:49,840
I don't think she knows how to...

3694
02:28:49,840 --> 02:28:50,640
Go upstairs.

3695
02:28:52,540 --> 02:28:53,640
Yeah, she doesn't.

3696
02:28:54,060 --> 02:28:55,000
So I can stay here.

3697
02:29:01,250 --> 02:29:04,570
Jenny is in the nerd castle elevator where you avoided...

3698
02:29:04,570 --> 02:29:05,970
Wait, who's gravity guy?

3699
02:29:06,250 --> 02:29:07,970
I don't remember...

3700
02:29:07,970 --> 02:29:09,990
Guys, you gotta be specific.

3701
02:29:10,270 --> 02:29:12,330
I avoided a lot of people.

3702
02:29:14,770 --> 02:29:17,150
Thank you for the super chat, Saika.

3703
02:29:17,310 --> 02:29:18,330
Thank you, thank you.

3704
02:29:20,950 --> 02:29:23,550
I avoided so many people.

3705
02:29:23,710 --> 02:29:25,010
You gotta be more specific.

3706
02:29:25,290 --> 02:29:25,690
Keep there.

3707
02:29:26,690 --> 02:29:27,790
Oh, at the school.

3708
02:29:35,720 --> 02:29:37,360
Purple magic guy?

3709
02:29:37,680 --> 02:29:38,940
Okay, you gotta be more specific.

3710
02:29:39,640 --> 02:29:40,060
No!

3711
02:29:40,440 --> 02:29:40,680
Fuck!

3712
02:29:42,760 --> 02:29:44,700
I got distracted again.

3713
02:29:46,800 --> 02:29:47,520
Okay.

3714
02:29:48,320 --> 02:29:49,860
That could be anyone.

3715
02:29:49,860 --> 02:29:50,500
I know.

3716
02:29:51,520 --> 02:29:53,780
So many people wanna kill me.

3717
02:29:54,040 --> 02:29:55,740
It could be any one of these people.

3718
02:29:56,720 --> 02:29:58,240
Oh my god.

3719
02:29:58,780 --> 02:29:59,780
I'm okay.

3720
02:29:59,780 --> 02:29:59,860
Okay.

3721
02:30:01,580 --> 02:30:02,840
I'm so healthy.

3722
02:30:09,260 --> 02:30:10,660
Oh my god.

3723
02:30:10,760 --> 02:30:12,160
What the fuck?

3724
02:30:12,520 --> 02:30:13,800
Where did this sound?

3725
02:30:13,920 --> 02:30:15,180
Why is this sound, man?

3726
02:30:15,300 --> 02:30:16,420
It's so fucking strong!

3727
02:30:17,780 --> 02:30:18,440
Oh

3728
02:30:21,830 --> 02:30:22,270
my god.

3729
02:30:22,650 --> 02:30:24,010
Oh my god.

3730
02:30:26,300 --> 02:30:27,720
Okay, it doesn't help that like...

3731
02:30:28,310 --> 02:30:29,350
That lag there.

3732
02:30:29,650 --> 02:30:30,650
That stutter there.

3733
02:30:31,410 --> 02:30:32,190
Oh, do they...

3734
02:30:32,190 --> 02:30:35,210
This area is making me stutter so much too.

3735
02:30:36,890 --> 02:30:38,710
Like this particular area.

3736
02:30:39,630 --> 02:30:41,990
I don't think I've had like, such bad stutters.

3737
02:30:42,290 --> 02:30:42,830
Before.

3738
02:30:44,850 --> 02:30:46,510
Hey guys, did I miss anything?

3739
02:30:46,910 --> 02:30:48,350
I'm trying to find Jenny.

3740
02:30:49,230 --> 02:30:52,990
So I can like, hop inside and rock her world, Bandai.

3741
02:30:59,420 --> 02:30:59,980
Yeah.

3742
02:31:00,160 --> 02:31:01,120
Yeah, zero deaths so far.

3743
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:02,720
Is that her?

3744
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:03,820
Jenny, is that you?

3745
02:31:07,140 --> 02:31:08,040
Oh shit!

3746
02:31:08,500 --> 02:31:08,780
No!

3747
02:31:09,120 --> 02:31:09,240
No!

3748
02:31:12,200 --> 02:31:13,260
Found her sister.

3749
02:31:17,360 --> 02:31:18,300
Free item!

3750
02:31:19,840 --> 02:31:21,220
Free item, let's go!

3751
02:31:21,540 --> 02:31:22,260
Let's go!

3752
02:31:25,420 --> 02:31:27,000
Oh wait, there's another item here.

3753
02:31:30,550 --> 02:31:30,870
Okay.

3754
02:31:31,610 --> 02:31:33,850
Oh my god, please tell me there's a Grace nearby.

3755
02:31:37,170 --> 02:31:40,390
Okay, there are three people hanging out.

3756
02:31:40,750 --> 02:31:41,150
Hang out.

3757
02:31:44,610 --> 02:31:45,890
Nimble sword ahead.

3758
02:31:47,490 --> 02:31:50,350
Oh my god, I have to use Arrows Donut.

3759
02:31:51,150 --> 02:31:51,750
Okay.

3760
02:31:55,270 --> 02:31:56,230
Alright, I got this.

3761
02:32:01,900 --> 02:32:02,900
Wait, what's wrong with him?

3762
02:32:04,320 --> 02:32:05,220
Are they okay?

3763
02:32:06,500 --> 02:32:07,620
It's okay, guys.

3764
02:32:07,900 --> 02:32:08,780
It's just a flesh wound.

3765
02:32:09,980 --> 02:32:11,460
Is it worth killing them?

3766
02:32:16,190 --> 02:32:18,230
I don't even know if that was worth killing them.

3767
02:32:19,210 --> 02:32:20,650
No, they're not okay.

3768
02:32:23,390 --> 02:32:24,470
What the fuck?

3769
02:32:24,630 --> 02:32:25,910
How are they hitting me?

3770
02:32:26,270 --> 02:32:27,910
They can't even move!

3771
02:32:27,910 --> 02:32:29,310
Oh my god, I have nothing.

3772
02:32:29,430 --> 02:32:30,070
No more flask.

3773
02:32:30,230 --> 02:32:31,730
I have no more flask.

3774
02:32:31,910 --> 02:32:32,150
I have no more flask.

3775
02:32:32,150 --> 02:32:33,190
Oh, this is bad.

3776
02:32:34,050 --> 02:32:34,650
What are they doing?

3777
02:32:34,770 --> 02:32:35,450
They're just praying.

3778
02:32:36,950 --> 02:32:37,690
The fuck are they doing?

3779
02:32:37,690 --> 02:32:37,770
Okay.

3780
02:32:42,310 --> 02:32:42,890
Oh.

3781
02:32:43,610 --> 02:32:44,190
Can't even.

3782
02:32:44,450 --> 02:32:44,950
Can't even.

3783
02:32:45,130 --> 02:32:45,570
Move!

3784
02:32:49,530 --> 02:32:50,430
Okay, nice.

3785
02:32:53,390 --> 02:32:55,730
We need the lantern because I can't see shit.

3786
02:32:56,450 --> 02:32:57,130
Fear ahead.

3787
02:32:57,510 --> 02:32:58,490
Monstrosity ahead.

3788
02:32:59,390 --> 02:32:59,710
Where?

3789
02:33:00,070 --> 02:33:03,650
Oh my god, please tell me there is a...

3790
02:33:04,310 --> 02:33:05,970
Please tell me.

3791
02:33:07,190 --> 02:33:09,570
Please tell me there's like a grace somewhere.

3792
02:33:13,030 --> 02:33:14,850
God, I just need one grace.

3793
02:33:14,850 --> 02:33:15,990
That's right.

3794
02:33:16,130 --> 02:33:17,510
No more praying for you.

3795
02:33:18,010 --> 02:33:18,630
Hey there.

3796
02:33:19,930 --> 02:33:20,210
Hi.

3797
02:33:22,170 --> 02:33:23,810
I can't really do anything.

3798
02:33:24,970 --> 02:33:26,090
Oh my god!

3799
02:33:28,730 --> 02:33:30,170
Okay, I got baited there.

3800
02:33:32,390 --> 02:33:33,230
Guys, please.

3801
02:33:33,850 --> 02:33:36,030
I can't slowly die from poison.

3802
02:33:36,250 --> 02:33:37,290
Please don't do this to me.

3803
02:33:41,070 --> 02:33:43,490
There's one below but beware of ambush.

3804
02:33:43,670 --> 02:33:44,270
God damn it.

3805
02:33:44,810 --> 02:33:46,150
There's always ambush.

3806
02:33:48,970 --> 02:33:50,150
Guys, I'm just fine.

3807
02:33:50,330 --> 02:33:51,450
It's just like...

3808
02:33:52,110 --> 02:33:53,590
It's just a little poison guys.

3809
02:33:53,670 --> 02:33:54,370
I'm fine.

3810
02:33:55,610 --> 02:33:57,890
I ate some random berries but it's okay.

3811
02:33:58,050 --> 02:33:58,890
I can poop it out.

3812
02:33:59,330 --> 02:34:00,530
That's how it works, right?

3813
02:34:01,290 --> 02:34:02,150
Guys, please.

3814
02:34:02,270 --> 02:34:02,870
I'm slowly dying.

3815
02:34:03,250 --> 02:34:03,450
Please.

3816
02:34:03,750 --> 02:34:04,390
Message a...

3817
02:34:04,390 --> 02:34:04,690
Please.

3818
02:34:04,970 --> 02:34:05,890
Message a praise.

3819
02:34:06,050 --> 02:34:06,810
I'm slowly dying.

3820
02:34:07,190 --> 02:34:09,510
Guys, I have no grace near me.

3821
02:34:09,790 --> 02:34:10,110
Please.

3822
02:34:10,650 --> 02:34:11,650
Oh, thank god.

3823
02:34:11,870 --> 02:34:12,750
Okay, I'm just one HP.

3824
02:34:13,210 --> 02:34:13,650
It's alright.

3825
02:34:14,270 --> 02:34:15,210
I can live through this.

3826
02:34:16,890 --> 02:34:18,170
It's just a flesh wound.

3827
02:34:20,630 --> 02:34:21,650
I'm so healthy.

3828
02:34:23,750 --> 02:34:24,170
What?

3829
02:34:24,270 --> 02:34:25,070
They can't move now?

3830
02:34:25,270 --> 02:34:25,470
Oh!

3831
02:34:26,110 --> 02:34:26,470
Guys!

3832
02:34:26,670 --> 02:34:27,750
Guys, they can't move!

3833
02:34:28,010 --> 02:34:28,390
Guys!

3834
02:34:28,750 --> 02:34:29,170
Please!

3835
02:34:29,530 --> 02:34:30,390
Message a praise!

3836
02:34:30,670 --> 02:34:31,830
Man, he's on my tail!

3837
02:34:32,010 --> 02:34:33,550
He's right behind me, isn't he?

3838
02:34:33,770 --> 02:34:34,650
He's right!

3839
02:34:35,010 --> 02:34:35,330
Oh!

3840
02:34:36,190 --> 02:34:36,710
That's okay.

3841
02:34:36,790 --> 02:34:37,530
He can't get through this.

3842
02:34:38,570 --> 02:34:39,150
That's okay.

3843
02:34:39,290 --> 02:34:39,870
I have a pillar.

3844
02:34:40,850 --> 02:34:41,330
Guys!

3845
02:34:41,630 --> 02:34:43,350
He's gonna touch me and I'll be dead!

3846
02:34:44,430 --> 02:34:44,870
Okay.

3847
02:34:46,030 --> 02:34:46,670
It's okay.

3848
02:34:46,850 --> 02:34:47,130
He can't...

3849
02:34:47,130 --> 02:34:47,650
Oh my god.

3850
02:34:47,890 --> 02:34:48,310
It's not okay.

3851
02:34:48,550 --> 02:34:49,050
He can't jump!

3852
02:34:51,330 --> 02:34:52,310
Ha ha ha!

3853
02:34:52,490 --> 02:34:53,790
That's a great...

3854
02:34:53,790 --> 02:34:54,410
Idiot!

3855
02:34:55,350 --> 02:34:56,530
He can't jump!

3856
02:34:57,130 --> 02:34:58,550
What you gonna do now?

3857
02:34:58,850 --> 02:34:59,450
Look at you!

3858
02:35:00,170 --> 02:35:00,650
Stupid!

3859
02:35:02,250 --> 02:35:03,190
Ha ha ha!

3860
02:35:03,590 --> 02:35:04,930
You can't do jack shit!

3861
02:35:05,910 --> 02:35:07,790
The wall is in front of you!

3862
02:35:08,890 --> 02:35:09,630
Ha ha ha!

3863
02:35:09,790 --> 02:35:10,430
Oh my god!

3864
02:35:10,590 --> 02:35:10,770
Okay!

3865
02:35:11,430 --> 02:35:12,750
I mean...

3866
02:35:12,750 --> 02:35:14,350
I gotta be careful here.

3867
02:35:16,610 --> 02:35:17,570
Okay, there we go.

3868
02:35:17,950 --> 02:35:18,350
Ha ha!

3869
02:35:18,550 --> 02:35:19,610
Me and the wall!

3870
02:35:20,290 --> 02:35:21,250
My hero!

3871
02:35:21,950 --> 02:35:23,130
Ha ha ha!

3872
02:35:23,310 --> 02:35:23,910
Look at that!

3873
02:35:23,910 --> 02:35:25,030
I live.

3874
02:35:26,650 --> 02:35:28,810
Got the wall on my side.

3875
02:35:30,410 --> 02:35:33,360
There's grace below the staircase.

3876
02:35:34,090 --> 02:35:34,270
Guys!

3877
02:35:34,430 --> 02:35:35,650
I am like...

3878
02:35:35,650 --> 02:35:37,890
Living by the thread right now.

3879
02:35:41,350 --> 02:35:42,670
Oh god.

3880
02:35:44,770 --> 02:35:46,110
Oh god.

3881
02:35:47,890 --> 02:35:49,430
I hear them.

3882
02:35:50,330 --> 02:35:51,630
I hear them.

3883
02:35:51,810 --> 02:35:52,390
I hear them.

3884
02:35:52,650 --> 02:35:53,110
I hear them growling.

3885
02:35:54,570 --> 02:35:55,470
They know.

3886
02:35:57,550 --> 02:35:58,590
They know!

3887
02:35:59,450 --> 02:36:00,790
They fucking know!

3888
02:36:00,910 --> 02:36:01,470
Okay, guys.

3889
02:36:01,670 --> 02:36:02,030
Come on.

3890
02:36:02,530 --> 02:36:03,110
Here you...

3891
02:36:03,110 --> 02:36:03,690
Come on.

3892
02:36:03,950 --> 02:36:04,710
Ha ha ha!

3893
02:36:09,750 --> 02:36:10,390
Please.

3894
02:36:10,670 --> 02:36:11,690
I have an extra message.

3895
02:36:12,090 --> 02:36:12,690
Just...

3896
02:36:12,690 --> 02:36:13,510
Just come here!

3897
02:36:14,050 --> 02:36:15,750
Just don't get it!

3898
02:36:24,940 --> 02:36:25,460
Okay.

3899
02:36:25,660 --> 02:36:26,920
There's one right here.

3900
02:36:38,080 --> 02:36:38,600
Okay.

3901
02:36:39,320 --> 02:36:40,620
That's where it is.

3902
02:36:47,060 --> 02:36:48,380
It's right there, right?

3903
02:36:49,480 --> 02:36:49,980
It's...

3904
02:36:49,980 --> 02:36:50,540
It's...

3905
02:36:50,540 --> 02:36:51,600
It's right there.

3906
02:36:52,700 --> 02:36:53,220
Right?

3907
02:36:53,480 --> 02:36:54,300
Is it right there?

3908
02:36:54,500 --> 02:36:55,440
Oh my god.

3909
02:36:55,640 --> 02:36:56,160
They're all there.

3910
02:36:56,480 --> 02:36:56,740
Please.

3911
02:36:56,860 --> 02:36:57,120
I just...

3912
02:36:57,120 --> 02:36:57,520
Oh my god.

3913
02:36:57,620 --> 02:36:57,800
Okay.

3914
02:36:57,980 --> 02:36:58,960
I can make it now.

3915
02:37:04,660 --> 02:37:05,860
Like I said, right.

3916
02:37:05,860 --> 02:37:05,940
Wait.

3917
02:37:07,460 --> 02:37:08,620
Where is it?

3918
02:37:09,040 --> 02:37:09,600
Wait.

3919
02:37:09,920 --> 02:37:10,700
Where is it?

3920
02:37:10,940 --> 02:37:12,540
Do you mean my left?

3921
02:37:17,500 --> 02:37:18,900
Oh my god.

3922
02:37:19,120 --> 02:37:20,760
It was my left side.

3923
02:37:24,080 --> 02:37:25,380
That is incredible.

3924
02:37:28,160 --> 02:37:28,620
Oh.

3925
02:37:29,080 --> 02:37:29,720
Oh!

3926
02:37:29,960 --> 02:37:30,400
Oh!

3927
02:37:30,620 --> 02:37:31,120
Oh!

3928
02:37:31,420 --> 02:37:31,640
Oh!

3929
02:37:36,250 --> 02:37:36,950
Okay.

3930
02:37:36,950 --> 02:37:36,970
Okay.

3931
02:37:39,510 --> 02:37:40,290
It's fine.

3932
02:37:40,690 --> 02:37:41,290
It's fine.

3933
02:37:41,410 --> 02:37:42,190
I have the HP.

3934
02:37:45,730 --> 02:37:46,030
Okay.

3935
02:37:50,580 --> 02:37:51,360
It's fine.

3936
02:37:52,640 --> 02:37:54,500
I'm not scared anymore!

3937
02:37:55,460 --> 02:37:56,960
That's fucking right!

3938
02:37:59,360 --> 02:38:01,540
I'm not scared of anything!

3939
02:38:03,020 --> 02:38:03,620
Okay.

3940
02:38:03,620 --> 02:38:04,460
That has to be the grace.

3941
02:38:04,700 --> 02:38:05,060
Oh!

3942
02:38:05,180 --> 02:38:05,720
I made it.

3943
02:38:05,820 --> 02:38:06,960
I fucking made it.

3944
02:38:07,200 --> 02:38:07,660
Shit.

3945
02:38:07,660 --> 02:38:09,620
I faced my fears!

3946
02:38:10,660 --> 02:38:13,360
I told you how to raise your hands!

3947
02:38:15,120 --> 02:38:16,660
Thank fucking god!

3948
02:38:17,020 --> 02:38:17,200
Okay.

3949
02:38:17,360 --> 02:38:19,020
I think I can have one more level up.

3950
02:38:19,240 --> 02:38:19,460
Alright.

3951
02:38:23,280 --> 02:38:24,900
Yeah, I can use this.

3952
02:38:29,700 --> 02:38:30,260
Alright.

3953
02:38:30,500 --> 02:38:31,720
And then...

3954
02:38:31,720 --> 02:38:32,760
Endurance.

3955
02:38:33,120 --> 02:38:35,320
I think it is like endurance to 20, right?

3956
02:38:36,240 --> 02:38:37,480
Praise the sun!

3957
02:38:42,660 --> 02:38:43,840
Now I go this way.

3958
02:38:45,580 --> 02:38:46,260
Woo!

3959
02:38:48,220 --> 02:38:48,900
Shortcut!

3960
02:38:49,960 --> 02:38:51,200
To your death!

3961
02:38:53,120 --> 02:38:54,580
What is this shortcut?

3962
02:38:56,460 --> 02:38:58,360
I mean, I could just go down here.

3963
02:39:01,740 --> 02:39:03,520
Do not go down there!

3964
02:39:03,760 --> 02:39:04,740
Go back up!

3965
02:39:05,400 --> 02:39:06,580
Go back up!

3966
02:39:09,720 --> 02:39:11,080
Floor is lava!

3967
02:39:12,800 --> 02:39:14,020
Floor is lava!

3968
02:39:15,620 --> 02:39:19,140
There's some very angry things down there.

3969
02:39:19,940 --> 02:39:20,640
Never mind.

3970
02:39:20,900 --> 02:39:22,060
I like being up here.

3971
02:39:24,600 --> 02:39:26,220
Downstairs is danger.

3972
02:39:28,700 --> 02:39:29,460
What item?

3973
02:39:31,780 --> 02:39:34,540
I actually don't know if I should be going...

3974
02:39:34,540 --> 02:39:37,440
I like how I'm full HP and now I'm...

3975
02:39:37,440 --> 02:39:38,340
Now...

3976
02:39:38,340 --> 02:39:39,520
Now I'm getting...

3977
02:39:40,400 --> 02:39:42,520
Getting the fucking appraisals.

3978
02:39:42,700 --> 02:39:43,400
You fuckers.

3979
02:39:43,580 --> 02:39:46,300
You guys were waiting for it this entire time!

3980
02:39:47,540 --> 02:39:48,740
You fuckers!

3981
02:39:53,920 --> 02:39:55,660
Oh, I have to go downstairs?

3982
02:39:56,100 --> 02:39:56,780
God dammit.

3983
02:39:56,920 --> 02:39:57,060
Okay.

3984
02:39:57,800 --> 02:39:58,420
Is there an item?

3985
02:39:58,580 --> 02:39:59,080
Oh, there is.

3986
02:40:01,560 --> 02:40:03,600
It only took one person to break.

3987
02:40:07,860 --> 02:40:09,720
Okay, we have to go downstairs.

3988
02:40:10,680 --> 02:40:12,560
All it takes was one guy.

3989
02:40:13,320 --> 02:40:13,760
Oh my god.

3990
02:40:13,760 --> 02:40:14,500
I missed the map.

3991
02:40:14,640 --> 02:40:15,880
The map was all the way over there.

3992
02:40:16,120 --> 02:40:16,360
It's good.

3993
02:40:16,400 --> 02:40:17,620
We don't need the map!

3994
02:40:18,420 --> 02:40:19,840
We don't need navigate...

3995
02:40:19,840 --> 02:40:20,220
Oh my god.

3996
02:40:20,220 --> 02:40:21,280
I don't have my horse.

3997
02:40:24,780 --> 02:40:25,220
Okay.

3998
02:40:25,460 --> 02:40:26,720
I don't know what to do.

3999
02:40:28,880 --> 02:40:29,760
No center.

4000
02:40:30,180 --> 02:40:30,460
Okay.

4001
02:40:30,780 --> 02:40:32,260
We can run past all of this.

4002
02:40:33,140 --> 02:40:33,560
Wee!

4003
02:40:35,500 --> 02:40:36,800
Okay, we don't need that item.

4004
02:40:37,820 --> 02:40:38,780
It's not that important.

4005
02:40:39,400 --> 02:40:40,660
Alright, we go this way.

4006
02:40:45,480 --> 02:40:46,960
Wait, was that the shortcut?

4007
02:40:47,780 --> 02:40:49,280
No, I've never been here before.

4008
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:52,100
What the fuck?

4009
02:40:52,300 --> 02:40:52,800
What is that?

4010
02:40:55,140 --> 02:40:56,280
That's a new weapon.

4011
02:40:56,640 --> 02:40:57,340
He has a new weapon.

4012
02:40:59,040 --> 02:41:00,100
Oh shit!

4013
02:41:00,260 --> 02:41:00,900
He's whipping me!

4014
02:41:01,620 --> 02:41:02,120
Oh!

4015
02:41:02,900 --> 02:41:03,460
Oh!

4016
02:41:04,440 --> 02:41:05,000
Please!

4017
02:41:05,340 --> 02:41:05,700
No!

4018
02:41:06,020 --> 02:41:06,380
No!

4019
02:41:06,380 --> 02:41:06,420
No!

4020
02:41:09,280 --> 02:41:11,780
I rolled into everything!

4021
02:41:12,460 --> 02:41:12,880
I...

4022
02:41:12,880 --> 02:41:14,260
Oh my god!

4023
02:41:15,020 --> 02:41:15,420
I...

4024
02:41:15,420 --> 02:41:16,380
I panicked!

4025
02:41:16,560 --> 02:41:18,060
He started whipping me!

4026
02:41:18,820 --> 02:41:21,900
He's seriously like, Get back to work!

4027
02:41:22,040 --> 02:41:22,700
I was like, No!

4028
02:41:23,240 --> 02:41:25,680
I don't wanna go back to work!

4029
02:41:28,080 --> 02:41:28,880
Please!

4030
02:41:28,880 --> 02:41:32,160
I just wanna play Marvel Rivals!

4031
02:41:35,980 --> 02:41:36,620
Okay.

4032
02:41:38,640 --> 02:41:39,720
Oh my god, guys.

4033
02:41:40,020 --> 02:41:40,340
Sorry.

4034
02:41:41,660 --> 02:41:44,180
My screen closed there for a second.

4035
02:41:44,340 --> 02:41:45,240
But I saw zero deaths.

4036
02:41:45,900 --> 02:41:47,020
Oh my god!

4037
02:41:47,180 --> 02:41:48,400
My fucking toe touched.

4038
02:41:49,020 --> 02:41:51,460
Guys, it's technically still zero deaths, guys.

4039
02:41:54,860 --> 02:41:55,500
Alright.

4040
02:41:57,920 --> 02:41:59,640
My screen closed for a second.

4041
02:41:59,800 --> 02:42:00,480
But I assume I live.

4042
02:42:05,920 --> 02:42:07,500
What was the plan there?

4043
02:42:07,580 --> 02:42:08,620
That's a good question.

4044
02:42:09,260 --> 02:42:09,640
I...

4045
02:42:09,640 --> 02:42:10,540
No!

4046
02:42:10,980 --> 02:42:11,360
Please!

4047
02:42:11,700 --> 02:42:13,260
I don't wanna go back to...

4048
02:42:13,260 --> 02:42:13,340
No!

4049
02:42:18,820 --> 02:42:20,180
Who will win?

4050
02:42:20,440 --> 02:42:22,700
One fucking lizard with a whip.

4051
02:42:28,160 --> 02:42:28,680
I don't know.

4052
02:42:28,680 --> 02:42:29,460
Oh my god!

4053
02:42:30,040 --> 02:42:31,280
I don't know.

4054
02:42:31,460 --> 02:42:33,120
It's like, PTSD or some shit.

4055
02:42:33,320 --> 02:42:33,540
I...

4056
02:42:35,420 --> 02:42:36,660
I don't know why!

4057
02:42:37,060 --> 02:42:38,100
This one...

4058
02:42:38,100 --> 02:42:41,880
I didn't die to any other boss, but this one guy...

4059
02:42:42,920 --> 02:42:44,380
He just has a whip!

4060
02:42:44,540 --> 02:42:45,880
There's just something about him!

4061
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:46,540
His aura!

4062
02:42:50,100 --> 02:42:52,780
Cus, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

4063
02:42:53,660 --> 02:42:56,220
Kaffily Toki's manager is in the game.

4064
02:42:57,560 --> 02:43:00,280
Uh, Thomas, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

4065
02:43:00,400 --> 02:43:02,100
I was gonna say, don't die, but you did.

4066
02:43:02,200 --> 02:43:03,740
No, no, zero deaths, guys.

4067
02:43:04,320 --> 02:43:05,320
Still zero deaths.

4068
02:43:06,420 --> 02:43:08,580
Oh my god, there's just something about him.

4069
02:43:11,400 --> 02:43:13,220
That just... fucks me up.

4070
02:43:20,160 --> 02:43:21,940
Okay, I can roll this.

4071
02:43:22,300 --> 02:43:23,700
I can roll this.

4072
02:43:24,780 --> 02:43:27,320
Haha, your whip is not long enough here.

4073
02:43:30,660 --> 02:43:32,320
Okay, it was long enough.

4074
02:43:33,960 --> 02:43:35,340
Okay, it's fine.

4075
02:43:37,500 --> 02:43:39,420
Please, it's just one more hit.

4076
02:43:39,700 --> 02:43:40,580
Okay, we did it.

4077
02:43:41,400 --> 02:43:45,000
And then his buddy is slowly walking over, but I see you.

4078
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:47,200
I fucking see you.

4079
02:43:48,800 --> 02:43:49,320
Alright.

4080
02:43:49,820 --> 02:43:50,920
Oh my god, what the fuck?

4081
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:51,760
What is he doing here?

4082
02:43:52,720 --> 02:43:53,640
This guy is new?

4083
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:55,520
AHHHHH!

4084
02:43:56,400 --> 02:43:57,280
You can stay there.

4085
02:43:57,720 --> 02:43:58,720
You can stay there.

4086
02:43:59,780 --> 02:44:00,480
Fuck you.

4087
02:44:02,440 --> 02:44:03,820
Up ahead in the shortcut.

4088
02:44:04,020 --> 02:44:04,140
Okay.

4089
02:44:05,020 --> 02:44:08,100
Looks like your Influencer build is hitting a wall.

4090
02:44:08,280 --> 02:44:10,200
Maybe you need a respect.

4091
02:44:11,220 --> 02:44:12,500
Maybe, thank you for the super chat.

4092
02:44:12,620 --> 02:44:13,500
Thank you, thank you.

4093
02:44:14,040 --> 02:44:17,040
Yeah, technically I didn't die if I closed my eyes.

4094
02:44:19,560 --> 02:44:21,400
Okay, we're not going for that guy.

4095
02:44:21,620 --> 02:44:23,960
That guy feels like he might fuck me up.

4096
02:44:25,320 --> 02:44:27,140
There has to be a shortcut here somewhere.

4097
02:44:31,360 --> 02:44:32,300
Okay, nice.

4098
02:44:33,320 --> 02:44:34,300
Likely down.

4099
02:44:34,580 --> 02:44:35,200
Something ahead.

4100
02:44:36,940 --> 02:44:37,500
Here?

4101
02:44:42,500 --> 02:44:44,920
Oh, the shortcut is past him.

4102
02:44:45,100 --> 02:44:45,320
Okay.

4103
02:44:48,040 --> 02:44:48,600
Alright.

4104
02:44:48,780 --> 02:44:49,300
I don't understand.

4105
02:44:49,300 --> 02:44:50,700
Why can't I bring my...

4106
02:44:50,700 --> 02:44:51,760
Bring my horse?

4107
02:44:52,060 --> 02:44:52,960
We're outside.

4108
02:44:53,440 --> 02:44:55,040
Professor Oak can't stop me.

4109
02:44:58,880 --> 02:44:59,820
Oh my god.

4110
02:44:59,900 --> 02:45:00,980
He's literally just running at me.

4111
02:45:01,200 --> 02:45:02,160
Oh my god.

4112
02:45:02,260 --> 02:45:02,980
Okay, we're running.

4113
02:45:02,980 --> 02:45:04,840
I wanna open the shortcut first.

4114
02:45:05,800 --> 02:45:07,000
Wait, where's the shortcut?

4115
02:45:08,300 --> 02:45:08,860
Wait.

4116
02:45:09,920 --> 02:45:11,020
Wait, where is it?

4117
02:45:20,280 --> 02:45:21,080
Oh my god.

4118
02:45:21,340 --> 02:45:22,700
He put me in a corner!

4119
02:45:23,040 --> 02:45:24,580
He actually trapped me in the corner!

4120
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:25,840
Holy shit!

4121
02:45:25,960 --> 02:45:26,680
Okay, it's on the left.

4122
02:45:26,920 --> 02:45:27,920
It's on the left.

4123
02:45:28,320 --> 02:45:29,600
He like...

4124
02:45:29,600 --> 02:45:30,220
Okay.

4125
02:45:32,280 --> 02:45:33,820
Oh my god.

4126
02:45:34,800 --> 02:45:35,600
That's fire.

4127
02:45:36,540 --> 02:45:38,240
That's the boss room!

4128
02:45:42,900 --> 02:45:44,620
I'm in the boss room!

4129
02:45:45,160 --> 02:45:47,240
I'm in the boss room!

4130
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:49,100
Oh my fuck!

4131
02:45:49,740 --> 02:45:50,620
Oh shit!

4132
02:45:51,140 --> 02:45:53,320
I thought what you said go left!

4133
02:45:53,620 --> 02:45:55,780
I thought you meant inside left!

4134
02:45:56,500 --> 02:45:57,020
Oh no.

4135
02:45:57,400 --> 02:45:58,040
Oh no.

4136
02:45:58,520 --> 02:45:58,960
It's okay.

4137
02:45:59,400 --> 02:46:00,340
Oh my god.

4138
02:46:00,480 --> 02:46:01,460
I accidentally used it.

4139
02:46:01,600 --> 02:46:04,580
I keep accidentally thinking it's B instead of...

4140
02:46:04,580 --> 02:46:05,540
Oh my god.

4141
02:46:05,540 --> 02:46:06,040
It's okay.

4142
02:46:06,180 --> 02:46:07,260
My little bungee's here.

4143
02:46:07,460 --> 02:46:08,140
It's okay.

4144
02:46:08,160 --> 02:46:08,620
He's here.

4145
02:46:09,280 --> 02:46:10,340
He's here now.

4146
02:46:10,420 --> 02:46:11,260
He's here.

4147
02:46:12,540 --> 02:46:13,300
He's here.

4148
02:46:13,480 --> 02:46:13,540
He's here now.

4149
02:46:14,200 --> 02:46:14,800
He's here.

4150
02:46:15,440 --> 02:46:16,700
Get me outta here.

4151
02:46:17,020 --> 02:46:18,120
Get me outta here.

4152
02:46:18,400 --> 02:46:18,520
Get me outta here.

4153
02:46:20,640 --> 02:46:21,880
Oh my god.

4154
02:46:22,420 --> 02:46:23,500
This is very awkward.

4155
02:46:23,660 --> 02:46:25,560
We gotta stop running into each other like this.

4156
02:46:28,660 --> 02:46:29,740
Okay, we're fine.

4157
02:46:30,580 --> 02:46:31,360
We're fine.

4158
02:46:31,360 --> 02:46:32,780
We're so fine.

4159
02:46:33,200 --> 02:46:33,760
We're so fine.

4160
02:46:34,580 --> 02:46:35,760
He faded me!

4161
02:46:35,920 --> 02:46:38,580
I thought he was gonna try and kill the jellyfish!

4162
02:46:40,740 --> 02:46:42,500
But then he turned around!

4163
02:46:44,580 --> 02:46:46,820
He knew what I wanted to do!

4164
02:46:48,540 --> 02:46:49,520
Jesus Christ.

4165
02:46:49,600 --> 02:46:51,120
How do I get out of these flames?

4166
02:46:55,500 --> 02:46:56,020
Okay.

4167
02:46:59,920 --> 02:47:01,080
Oh my god.

4168
02:47:01,840 --> 02:47:03,100
Oh my god.

4169
02:47:03,240 --> 02:47:03,780
This is scary.

4170
02:47:05,400 --> 02:47:06,640
Bro, like, he does this!

4171
02:47:06,640 --> 02:47:07,520
He looks at him!

4172
02:47:07,620 --> 02:47:08,860
And then he turns around!

4173
02:47:09,460 --> 02:47:11,680
He's like, Oh, you thought I was trying to...

4174
02:47:12,720 --> 02:47:13,760
Fucking stupid!

4175
02:47:20,040 --> 02:47:21,320
Oh my god.

4176
02:47:21,600 --> 02:47:22,760
It's not fair!

4177
02:47:23,680 --> 02:47:23,820
Wait.

4178
02:47:24,180 --> 02:47:24,900
I can just be here.

4179
02:47:30,580 --> 02:47:31,660
That works.

4180
02:47:42,180 --> 02:47:43,440
I'll take that.

4181
02:47:43,700 --> 02:47:44,940
I'll take that.

4182
02:47:45,240 --> 02:47:46,000
You know...

4183
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:47,140
I'll take it.

4184
02:47:48,240 --> 02:47:50,160
I need every advantage...

4185
02:47:50,160 --> 02:47:52,840
I didn't even intentionally cheese that.

4186
02:47:53,060 --> 02:47:54,380
It just works.

4187
02:47:56,080 --> 02:47:57,340
Oh my god!

4188
02:47:57,560 --> 02:47:57,880
Please!

4189
02:47:58,040 --> 02:47:58,720
Message of praise.

4190
02:47:59,020 --> 02:47:59,220
Please!

4191
02:47:59,460 --> 02:48:00,260
Message of praise!

4192
02:48:00,540 --> 02:48:00,820
Guys!

4193
02:48:03,140 --> 02:48:04,140
Just one!

4194
02:48:04,140 --> 02:48:05,380
I just... Oh, thank God.

4195
02:48:05,520 --> 02:48:05,640
Okay.

4196
02:48:06,020 --> 02:48:06,540
Okay, it's fine.

4197
02:48:06,780 --> 02:48:07,480
It's fine.

4198
02:48:08,340 --> 02:48:09,000
It's fine.

4199
02:48:11,960 --> 02:48:12,660
It's fine.

4200
02:48:12,940 --> 02:48:14,700
We're so... Guys, how about another one, though?

4201
02:48:14,940 --> 02:48:16,300
How about another message of praise?

4202
02:48:16,600 --> 02:48:18,880
Guys, just another one, please.

4203
02:48:19,400 --> 02:48:20,580
Just another one.

4204
02:48:22,100 --> 02:48:23,300
Just to be safe.

4205
02:48:23,380 --> 02:48:24,240
Just to be safe, guys.

4206
02:48:24,760 --> 02:48:26,300
Just to be safe.

4207
02:48:27,640 --> 02:48:28,380
Just to be safe.

4208
02:48:28,380 --> 02:48:28,860
Just to be safe.

4209
02:48:29,780 --> 02:48:30,700
Just one more.

4210
02:48:34,140 --> 02:48:35,440
I thought it would work again.

4211
02:48:36,260 --> 02:48:40,500
I thought it would work, please.

4212
02:48:40,760 --> 02:48:41,360
Just one more.

4213
02:48:41,620 --> 02:48:42,480
Chad, just one more.

4214
02:48:42,580 --> 02:48:43,420
I beg of you, please.

4215
02:48:43,600 --> 02:48:44,320
Please, guys.

4216
02:48:44,620 --> 02:48:45,720
I just need one more.

4217
02:48:45,920 --> 02:48:46,320
Please.

4218
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:48,380
I just need to survive long enough.

4219
02:48:48,700 --> 02:48:48,940
Please.

4220
02:48:50,600 --> 02:48:51,080
Please.

4221
02:48:51,380 --> 02:48:51,860
The poison.

4222
02:48:52,260 --> 02:48:53,980
Just let me survive long enough.

4223
02:48:56,800 --> 02:48:57,520
Oh!

4224
02:48:57,520 --> 02:48:59,100
I beg of you!

4225
02:48:59,600 --> 02:49:00,260
One!

4226
02:49:00,420 --> 02:49:01,760
One massive surprise!

4227
02:49:02,120 --> 02:49:02,980
Just one!

4228
02:49:05,160 --> 02:49:06,940
I just need one!

4229
02:49:07,900 --> 02:49:08,900
I can't!

4230
02:49:09,100 --> 02:49:10,180
I'm so low!

4231
02:49:13,140 --> 02:49:13,860
One.

4232
02:49:14,120 --> 02:49:14,980
That's all I... Okay.

4233
02:49:27,990 --> 02:49:30,270
You fuckers!

4234
02:49:38,570 --> 02:49:41,510
I just need one more!

4235
02:49:41,790 --> 02:49:43,490
Oh my god!

4236
02:49:44,190 --> 02:49:48,690
It was actually... It was so low!

4237
02:49:49,310 --> 02:49:50,870
It was so low!

4238
02:49:50,890 --> 02:49:50,930
It was so low!

4239
02:49:50,950 --> 02:49:50,950
Oh!

4240
02:49:50,950 --> 02:49:52,130
I... Oh!

4241
02:49:52,250 --> 02:49:53,050
Thank you, guys!

4242
02:49:53,290 --> 02:49:55,350
Thank you for the message of praise!

4243
02:49:55,650 --> 02:49:56,670
Thank you, guys!

4244
02:49:56,870 --> 02:49:57,290
Thank you!

4245
02:49:57,610 --> 02:49:59,450
I really needed that!

4246
02:49:59,890 --> 02:50:12,810
Oh man!

4247
02:50:13,530 --> 02:50:14,490
Oh man!

4248
02:50:15,030 --> 02:50:15,850
Thanks, guys!

4249
02:50:22,870 --> 02:50:24,750
It's not my day.

4250
02:50:26,310 --> 02:50:28,870
It's not my day.

4251
02:50:29,570 --> 02:50:32,370
Live by the Influencer Pills.

4252
02:50:32,830 --> 02:50:35,790
Die by the... Oh my god!

4253
02:50:36,030 --> 02:50:39,270
And he's waiting for me too.

4254
02:50:39,890 --> 02:50:42,390
Oh my god, this time it'll be different.

4255
02:50:43,310 --> 02:50:44,510
This time.

4256
02:50:45,010 --> 02:50:48,270
You feel it now, Mr. Krabs.

4257
02:50:48,470 --> 02:50:50,330
Oh, thank you for this super chat.

4258
02:50:50,530 --> 02:50:51,650
Thank you, thank you.

4259
02:50:52,770 --> 02:50:54,650
That's so fucked up.

4260
02:50:56,750 --> 02:50:58,370
Alright, the left side.

4261
02:50:58,470 --> 02:50:59,970
Oh, I see the shortcut this time.

4262
02:51:01,510 --> 02:51:02,530
It's right here.

4263
02:51:03,670 --> 02:51:04,730
I see it.

4264
02:51:07,730 --> 02:51:10,150
It's okay, it'll take a while to get back to me.

4265
02:51:11,370 --> 02:51:13,270
Okay, now we have the shortcut.

4266
02:51:18,160 --> 02:51:20,040
I got you, Doki.

4267
02:51:20,640 --> 02:51:21,840
Message appraised.

4268
02:51:22,420 --> 02:51:24,380
Thank you for the super chat.

4269
02:51:24,720 --> 02:51:26,240
Okay, does this guy respawn?

4270
02:51:26,580 --> 02:51:27,700
I need to know.

4271
02:51:31,860 --> 02:51:33,560
Thank you for the raid.

4272
02:51:33,760 --> 02:51:34,900
Thank you, thank you.

4273
02:51:34,900 --> 02:51:35,060
I am.

4274
02:51:43,140 --> 02:51:45,200
Does he respawn or does he not?

4275
02:51:46,580 --> 02:51:47,060
Sorry.

4276
02:51:47,460 --> 02:51:48,180
He does?

4277
02:51:48,500 --> 02:51:48,800
Okay.

4278
02:51:51,800 --> 02:51:52,280
Alright.

4279
02:51:52,580 --> 02:51:55,000
There better be a fucking grace in front of me.

4280
02:52:03,720 --> 02:52:05,780
Alright, I'm gonna go here and see if there's a grace.

4281
02:52:15,770 --> 02:52:17,450
Alright, let's see.

4282
02:52:18,210 --> 02:52:19,610
Oh, thank god.

4283
02:52:20,010 --> 02:52:21,570
Thank fucking god.

4284
02:52:23,250 --> 02:52:26,350
I don't have to go through the fucking whip anymore.

4285
02:52:29,770 --> 02:52:31,290
You fuckers.

4286
02:52:38,670 --> 02:52:40,350
Wait, actually...

4287
02:52:45,920 --> 02:52:47,200
Is there like...

4288
02:52:47,200 --> 02:52:48,620
Okay, where's...

4289
02:52:48,620 --> 02:52:49,840
Is there a word...

4290
02:52:49,840 --> 02:52:51,020
Is there appraisal here?

4291
02:52:59,950 --> 02:53:01,410
Wait, where's appraisal?

4292
02:53:04,690 --> 02:53:05,530
First...

4293
02:53:11,120 --> 02:53:14,140
First off, time for message.

4294
02:53:15,020 --> 02:53:16,640
There we go.

4295
02:53:17,720 --> 02:53:19,460
Time for message.

4296
02:53:21,320 --> 02:53:22,280
Here we go.

4297
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:26,920
Oh, I hate that you can't...

4298
02:53:29,200 --> 02:53:30,920
I can't believe it.

4299
02:53:31,140 --> 02:53:32,000
I can't believe it.

4300
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:34,620
I think this is so fucked up.

4301
02:53:35,060 --> 02:53:37,980
I think it was literally like one hit.

4302
02:53:38,300 --> 02:53:39,980
It's so fucked up.

4303
02:53:39,980 --> 02:53:43,600
I needed one message appraised.

4304
02:53:44,560 --> 02:53:46,040
No, I didn't need to play my...

4305
02:53:46,040 --> 02:53:47,040
Oh my god, not the ladder.

4306
02:53:47,360 --> 02:53:47,440
No.

4307
02:53:47,680 --> 02:53:48,500
Oh my god, though.

4308
02:53:48,700 --> 02:53:50,120
Thank you for the body block.

4309
02:53:50,620 --> 02:53:52,620
Actual W body block right there.

4310
02:53:53,360 --> 02:53:54,340
Holy shit.

4311
02:53:55,060 --> 02:53:56,520
What a fucking hero.

4312
02:53:57,320 --> 02:53:59,320
What a hero right there.

4313
02:54:00,300 --> 02:54:02,460
Oh my god, a real hero.

4314
02:54:04,560 --> 02:54:05,260
Okay, nice.

4315
02:54:07,980 --> 02:54:09,260
Oh my god, okay.

4316
02:54:10,240 --> 02:54:11,240
Jesus Christ.

4317
02:54:12,520 --> 02:54:13,760
Oh, I just dodged it.

4318
02:54:13,860 --> 02:54:14,500
Where is my...

4319
02:54:14,500 --> 02:54:15,540
Where did I die?

4320
02:54:16,700 --> 02:54:17,800
Oh, I died here.

4321
02:54:20,240 --> 02:54:20,680
Okay.

4322
02:54:22,880 --> 02:54:23,540
Okay, nice.

4323
02:54:23,660 --> 02:54:25,540
My jellyfish relocated.

4324
02:54:29,750 --> 02:54:31,530
Jesus Christ, that hits me.

4325
02:54:31,710 --> 02:54:32,250
What is this?

4326
02:54:32,370 --> 02:54:33,930
What is this range?

4327
02:54:38,590 --> 02:54:40,790
Holy fuck, that range was crazy.

4328
02:54:41,870 --> 02:54:43,550
That was a crazy range.

4329
02:54:48,700 --> 02:54:49,940
Now I know I have to get there.

4330
02:54:49,940 --> 02:54:50,960
Okay, it's 2,000.

4331
02:54:51,100 --> 02:54:51,920
It's not that much anyway.

4332
02:54:53,240 --> 02:54:55,680
I don't really care about the 2,000.

4333
02:54:58,460 --> 02:55:00,460
I don't know what it is about this world.

4334
02:55:00,700 --> 02:55:02,020
Wait, let me look at my settings.

4335
02:55:03,680 --> 02:55:04,640
But it's just like...

4336
02:55:06,640 --> 02:55:11,800
What it is about this world where I stutter even more than usual.

4337
02:55:16,990 --> 02:55:18,930
That hitbox is fucking crazy.

4338
02:55:19,090 --> 02:55:19,910
He was one shot though.

4339
02:55:20,050 --> 02:55:22,290
He just don't get hit next time.

4340
02:55:22,790 --> 02:55:23,550
Yeah, it's just...

4341
02:55:23,550 --> 02:55:24,430
Just don't get hit.

4342
02:55:28,470 --> 02:55:29,530
It's the lava?

4343
02:55:30,170 --> 02:55:31,070
Oh, maybe.

4344
02:55:33,730 --> 02:55:38,270
Yeah, there's something about this particular enemy that does so much.

4345
02:55:40,670 --> 02:55:41,650
Oh my god.

4346
02:55:42,770 --> 02:55:43,370
Okay.

4347
02:55:44,550 --> 02:55:45,410
It's fine.

4348
02:55:47,010 --> 02:55:47,970
Okay, nice.

4349
02:55:48,430 --> 02:55:49,170
Get baited, bitch.

4350
02:55:49,670 --> 02:55:50,310
Ha ha!

4351
02:55:50,950 --> 02:55:52,110
Get baited.

4352
02:55:52,930 --> 02:55:53,810
Ha ha ha ha!

4353
02:55:53,950 --> 02:55:54,730
Oh, shit!

4354
02:55:54,730 --> 02:55:55,510
I got baited!

4355
02:55:57,530 --> 02:55:58,130
Okay.

4356
02:56:00,090 --> 02:56:01,510
Okay, I'm backing out.

4357
02:56:02,170 --> 02:56:02,690
Fuck you.

4358
02:56:04,130 --> 02:56:05,310
Okay, he's poisoned.

4359
02:56:05,470 --> 02:56:05,810
That's good.

4360
02:56:06,510 --> 02:56:08,810
Okay, maybe it'll work this time.

4361
02:56:09,070 --> 02:56:09,730
No!

4362
02:56:15,710 --> 02:56:17,590
I did not replicate it!

4363
02:56:17,870 --> 02:56:19,390
It was so good!

4364
02:56:19,490 --> 02:56:20,270
I wish I could!

4365
02:56:22,230 --> 02:56:25,350
I wish I could replicate whatever I did there.

4366
02:56:25,630 --> 02:56:26,770
When I fucking...

4367
02:56:27,630 --> 02:56:28,770
When I fucking...

4368
02:56:30,030 --> 02:56:31,320
managed to like...

4369
02:56:34,160 --> 02:56:36,540
When he started rolling into that...

4370
02:56:36,540 --> 02:56:37,700
Oh my god.

4371
02:56:38,280 --> 02:56:39,560
That was so good.

4372
02:56:39,820 --> 02:56:41,300
I don't know how to replicate it though.

4373
02:56:41,560 --> 02:56:43,380
I wish I could, guys!

4374
02:56:44,160 --> 02:56:46,620
I was actually gaming when that happened.

4375
02:56:49,860 --> 02:56:50,420
Okay.

4376
02:56:53,340 --> 02:56:54,100
Here we go.

4377
02:56:56,580 --> 02:56:58,100
I don't know his patterns.

4378
02:56:58,320 --> 02:56:59,520
I need to figure out his patterns more.

4379
02:56:59,640 --> 02:57:00,080
What?

4380
02:57:05,730 --> 02:57:06,810
He cheated!

4381
02:57:12,090 --> 02:57:14,250
He's just rolling around me!

4382
02:57:18,990 --> 02:57:19,470
Shit!

4383
02:57:20,610 --> 02:57:21,810
Okay, that doesn't go through.

4384
02:57:24,390 --> 02:57:25,290
I hate him.

4385
02:57:25,410 --> 02:57:25,970
Oh my god.

4386
02:57:26,030 --> 02:57:26,890
I hate him so much.

4387
02:57:27,590 --> 02:57:28,070
I'm...

4388
02:57:28,210 --> 02:57:29,010
I'm so...

4389
02:57:32,990 --> 02:57:33,290
Okay.

4390
02:57:35,610 --> 02:57:36,570
Jesus Christ.

4391
02:57:37,310 --> 02:57:37,890
This guy.

4392
02:57:38,250 --> 02:57:39,510
This guy's a fucker.

4393
02:57:44,770 --> 02:57:45,210
Okay.

4394
02:57:45,910 --> 02:57:46,350
Okay.

4395
02:57:46,570 --> 02:57:46,650
Okay.

4396
02:57:46,650 --> 02:57:46,970
Back off.

4397
02:57:47,150 --> 02:57:47,770
I'm backing up.

4398
02:57:48,190 --> 02:57:49,270
I'm backing up!

4399
02:57:49,410 --> 02:57:50,870
I give you personal space!

4400
02:57:51,190 --> 02:57:52,970
What more do you want from me?

4401
02:57:58,130 --> 02:57:58,910
Oh my god.

4402
02:58:00,590 --> 02:58:01,030
Okay.

4403
02:58:01,150 --> 02:58:01,990
Oh my god, bro.

4404
02:58:03,190 --> 02:58:03,550
Bro.

4405
02:58:05,630 --> 02:58:06,330
Oh my god.

4406
02:58:06,830 --> 02:58:07,510
Oh, is he dead?

4407
02:58:07,650 --> 02:58:08,170
Is he dead?

4408
02:58:08,210 --> 02:58:08,870
Oh, I did it!

4409
02:58:08,870 --> 02:58:11,130
Oh, I did it!

4410
02:58:13,230 --> 02:58:15,630
Oh, thank god for...

4411
02:58:16,010 --> 02:58:18,070
for message of praise!

4412
02:58:18,830 --> 02:58:20,170
Thank god!

4413
02:58:21,490 --> 02:58:22,370
Oh!

4414
02:58:24,110 --> 02:58:25,870
The message...

4415
02:58:25,870 --> 02:58:28,590
Thank god I have six health bars!

4416
02:58:29,050 --> 02:58:32,450
I don't even know if I've ever had this!

4417
02:58:32,450 --> 02:58:33,970
Is he a story boss?

4418
02:58:34,150 --> 02:58:35,390
I'll never know!

4419
02:58:35,390 --> 02:58:35,530
No!

4420
02:58:38,310 --> 02:58:38,670
Alright.

4421
02:58:42,560 --> 02:58:42,920
Four!

4422
02:58:43,080 --> 02:58:43,860
Thank you for the super chat!

4423
02:58:43,980 --> 02:58:44,220
Thank you!

4424
02:58:44,340 --> 02:58:44,820
Thank you!

4425
02:58:44,960 --> 02:58:48,020
Before you complete the Volcano Manor, make sure to do a letter side quest.

4426
02:58:48,180 --> 02:58:49,700
Lady Tanerath has you...

4427
02:58:49,700 --> 02:58:51,660
be a bounty hunter, kill people for loot.

4428
02:58:51,800 --> 02:58:55,620
Five possible, but you killed Patches low, so only four now!

4429
02:58:57,680 --> 02:58:59,660
Oh, we won't tell!

4430
02:59:01,600 --> 02:59:03,060
Okay, let me see if I can like...

4431
02:59:03,060 --> 02:59:04,540
Where's the graphics settings?

4432
02:59:06,400 --> 02:59:07,600
Where is it?

4433
02:59:07,840 --> 02:59:08,500
Maybe it's like...

4434
02:59:09,280 --> 02:59:10,280
Okay, off...

4435
02:59:11,220 --> 02:59:12,420
Advanced settings...

4436
02:59:12,420 --> 02:59:12,600
There...

4437
02:59:12,600 --> 02:59:12,880
Oh!

4438
02:59:19,450 --> 02:59:21,130
Okay, I think I know now.

4439
02:59:30,350 --> 02:59:32,330
Okay, guys, what do we turn off?

4440
02:59:32,670 --> 02:59:34,230
What do we turn off?

4441
02:59:35,450 --> 02:59:38,370
Okay, okay, that explains a lot.

4442
02:59:39,250 --> 02:59:41,050
Maybe now it will...

4443
02:59:41,050 --> 02:59:43,730
Okay, guys, we found the root of the problem.

4444
02:59:43,970 --> 02:59:45,470
It only took us four parts.

4445
02:59:45,630 --> 02:59:48,070
It only took us like a couple...

4446
02:59:48,070 --> 02:59:48,670
Like, I don't know.

4447
02:59:48,970 --> 02:59:49,870
Ten plus hours.

4448
02:59:50,390 --> 02:59:51,130
Alright, guys.

4449
02:59:52,770 --> 02:59:53,690
What do...

4450
02:59:53,690 --> 02:59:56,010
Okay, let's put everything on high first.

4451
02:59:57,750 --> 02:59:58,930
Maybe that'll be better.

4452
03:00:01,470 --> 03:00:01,970
Okay.

4453
03:00:03,810 --> 03:00:05,190
Okay, we gotta return.

4454
03:00:05,370 --> 03:00:07,610
Let's return to the title real fast.

4455
03:00:08,430 --> 03:00:09,070
Let's...

4456
03:00:11,510 --> 03:00:14,030
Okay, let's make sure we...

4457
03:00:14,030 --> 03:00:15,950
Okay, things make a little more sense now.

4458
03:00:17,630 --> 03:00:18,270
Okay.

4459
03:00:20,510 --> 03:00:23,290
It only took 15 hours, chat.

4460
03:00:23,510 --> 03:00:26,470
Just 15 hours to figure this out.

4461
03:00:34,050 --> 03:00:35,930
Oh, shadows and water to medium.

4462
03:00:36,150 --> 03:00:36,310
Okay.

4463
03:00:39,110 --> 03:00:40,310
Okay, was that fight...

4464
03:00:40,310 --> 03:00:43,530
I don't even remember if that fight stuttered that much in general.

4465
03:00:47,660 --> 03:00:50,720
Okay, we can turn effects and grass.

4466
03:00:53,600 --> 03:00:55,180
and then we go back to the title.

4467
03:00:58,530 --> 03:01:01,530
Are you going to be at the game before the dllc or after the dllc?

4468
03:01:01,570 --> 03:01:02,770
I don't have the dlc.

4469
03:01:03,270 --> 03:01:04,310
Uh let me give you.

4470
03:01:04,310 --> 03:01:06,490
I only said like what?

4471
03:01:06,850 --> 03:01:07,990
Seven story bosses.

4472
03:01:08,410 --> 03:01:09,450
Thank you in the super chat.

4473
03:01:09,530 --> 03:01:10,350
Thank you, thank you.

4474
03:01:10,510 --> 03:01:10,890
They real.

4475
03:01:11,070 --> 03:01:11,750
Thank you in the super chat.

4476
03:01:11,830 --> 03:01:12,670
Thank you, thank you.

4477
03:01:12,930 --> 03:01:14,110
You barely touch grass.

4478
03:01:14,250 --> 03:01:15,210
What do you mean?

4479
03:01:15,870 --> 03:01:19,030
No, I remember I adjusted the settings before.

4480
03:01:19,030 --> 03:01:24,910
I think, like, when I downgraded my drivers, it, like, reset all my graphic settings again.

4481
03:01:28,090 --> 03:01:32,210
Because I remember I, like, uh, I adjusted it before.

4482
03:01:39,380 --> 03:01:39,920
Okay.

4483
03:01:41,760 --> 03:01:42,300
Yeah?

4484
03:01:48,890 --> 03:01:52,350
I'm gonna be, like, Rock Lee taking off of those weights.

4485
03:01:52,810 --> 03:01:54,090
Thank you, Super Chat toasting.

4486
03:01:54,310 --> 03:01:54,770
Thank you.

4487
03:01:56,350 --> 03:01:59,450
Guys, I don't think we're gonna make it to a story, boss.

4488
03:02:01,350 --> 03:02:02,810
I don't know, I haven't died yet.

4489
03:02:02,970 --> 03:02:07,930
If I close my eyes every time, then I've never died.

4490
03:02:08,190 --> 03:02:10,050
I didn't see my death, so I never died.

4491
03:02:11,090 --> 03:02:14,030
No treasure chest, therefore no arm, armaments ahead.

4492
03:02:14,290 --> 03:02:15,110
Why am I here?

4493
03:02:17,130 --> 03:02:18,370
Wait, this entire place?

4494
03:02:18,530 --> 03:02:19,490
Why am I here?

4495
03:02:23,970 --> 03:02:24,790
Golden runes.

4496
03:02:24,870 --> 03:02:26,030
I guess it's for level up.

4497
03:02:27,390 --> 03:02:28,630
Oh, wait, I can level up.

4498
03:02:28,630 --> 03:02:30,630
Oh, I didn't- I forgot I killed a boss just now.

4499
03:02:33,130 --> 03:02:34,810
Oh my god, I need to make sure not to jump down.

4500
03:02:36,950 --> 03:02:39,710
Yeah, I'm- I can't figure out where the elevator is.

4501
03:02:45,330 --> 03:02:45,730
Alright.

4502
03:02:46,470 --> 03:02:46,710
Alright.

4503
03:02:50,510 --> 03:02:50,910
Okay.

4504
03:02:52,270 --> 03:02:53,970
We got endurance up.

4505
03:02:55,010 --> 03:02:57,010
And we need 20- Do I have enough for 20k?

4506
03:02:57,390 --> 03:02:57,930
Let's check.

4507
03:03:04,610 --> 03:03:05,250
Uh, 6k.

4508
03:03:05,450 --> 03:03:06,190
Oh, I think- Do.

4509
03:03:09,110 --> 03:03:09,430
Yeah.

4510
03:03:11,210 --> 03:03:11,830
There you go.

4511
03:03:13,130 --> 03:03:13,450
Alright.

4512
03:03:14,390 --> 03:03:15,310
Wait, how much was it?

4513
03:03:15,430 --> 03:03:16,830
No, I actually need to do one more rune.

4514
03:03:19,230 --> 03:03:21,370
Alright, what do we do next after endurance?

4515
03:03:21,650 --> 03:03:23,770
Because I remember you guys said, like, up to 20k?

4516
03:03:30,230 --> 03:03:31,150
Dexterity, okay.

4517
03:03:31,950 --> 03:03:33,010
Okay, now I should have enough.

4518
03:03:36,530 --> 03:03:37,070
Alright.

4519
03:03:40,550 --> 03:03:42,590
Okay, where do we go after here?

4520
03:03:42,930 --> 03:03:43,190
Okay.

4521
03:03:52,580 --> 03:03:53,120
Alright.

4522
03:03:53,440 --> 03:03:55,520
We'll do one more boss and then I'll call it for today.

4523
03:04:06,130 --> 03:04:06,670
Uh...

4524
03:04:07,510 --> 03:04:08,330
Go outside?

4525
03:04:09,610 --> 03:04:11,470
Go back to the other elevator?

4526
03:04:11,750 --> 03:04:13,330
There's another elevator?

4527
03:04:15,510 --> 03:04:17,550
Oh, there's another door in the bottom.

4528
03:04:17,750 --> 03:04:19,190
Oh, it's the other magma worm.

4529
03:04:19,370 --> 03:04:20,270
Okay, I'll go back down.

4530
03:04:25,000 --> 03:04:25,960
Oh, that one.

4531
03:04:26,200 --> 03:04:26,940
That door, okay.

4532
03:04:31,600 --> 03:04:32,380
This one.

4533
03:04:35,460 --> 03:04:35,940
Lever!

4534
03:04:39,580 --> 03:04:40,840
No horse ahead?

4535
03:04:41,200 --> 03:04:41,880
It has to be here.

4536
03:04:45,700 --> 03:04:46,940
Wait, it does not move.

4537
03:04:49,560 --> 03:04:51,280
Jump down from second level?

4538
03:04:51,680 --> 03:04:51,860
Here?

4539
03:04:53,040 --> 03:04:53,680
Oh.

4540
03:04:56,840 --> 03:04:58,140
Yeah, that's dead end.

4541
03:05:03,110 --> 03:05:04,230
Why'd this guy die?

4542
03:05:05,730 --> 03:05:07,230
Oh, that's a shortcut?

4543
03:05:07,570 --> 03:05:07,710
Oh!

4544
03:05:09,730 --> 03:05:12,010
Oh, outside the boss room.

4545
03:05:12,210 --> 03:05:12,450
Okay.

4546
03:05:15,730 --> 03:05:17,530
I have to go back to the whip snake?

4547
03:05:18,010 --> 03:05:18,550
Him?

4548
03:05:19,590 --> 03:05:20,790
God damn it.

4549
03:05:25,170 --> 03:05:25,590
Hello.

4550
03:05:25,830 --> 03:05:26,890
I killed your boss.

4551
03:05:28,490 --> 03:05:29,590
Pretty bad at...

4552
03:05:30,250 --> 03:05:30,810
Pretty bad at...

4553
03:05:30,810 --> 03:05:31,990
Or a pretty bad bodyguard.

4554
03:05:32,130 --> 03:05:32,810
Not gonna lie.

4555
03:05:45,640 --> 03:05:46,480
You here?

4556
03:05:52,810 --> 03:05:53,850
Is this one?

4557
03:06:03,900 --> 03:06:04,980
Where am I?

4558
03:06:08,000 --> 03:06:08,680
Oh, hey.

4559
03:06:08,760 --> 03:06:09,320
There's an item.

4560
03:06:11,920 --> 03:06:13,460
Oh, there he is.

4561
03:06:14,600 --> 03:06:15,280
That's right.

4562
03:06:15,520 --> 03:06:16,420
I have jellyfish.

4563
03:06:16,620 --> 03:06:20,140
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

4564
03:06:20,800 --> 03:06:21,140
No!

4565
03:06:25,180 --> 03:06:25,760
It's okay.

4566
03:06:26,020 --> 03:06:26,700
I'm okay.

4567
03:06:26,940 --> 03:06:27,560
I'm okay.

4568
03:06:27,800 --> 03:06:28,840
I am not okay.

4569
03:06:28,840 --> 03:06:29,860
I am not...

4570
03:06:29,860 --> 03:06:31,860
Wait, he doesn't even have a boss safe...

4571
03:06:31,860 --> 03:06:32,640
This guy's not

4572
03:06:39,580 --> 03:06:40,380
even...

4573
03:06:49,290 --> 03:06:51,470
This is a non...

4574
03:06:51,470 --> 03:06:52,730
No one said...

4575
03:06:52,730 --> 03:06:56,530
I said we're gonna fight a boss.

4576
03:06:58,050 --> 03:06:59,490
And then why?

4577
03:06:59,750 --> 03:07:01,070
Okay, it's because I...

4578
03:07:01,070 --> 03:07:04,050
I tactically stopped fighting him.

4579
03:07:04,170 --> 03:07:06,510
Because I realized he wasn't a boss.

4580
03:07:06,730 --> 03:07:08,570
So I stopped fighting him.

4581
03:07:10,370 --> 03:07:11,970
It was tactical.

4582
03:07:12,910 --> 03:07:13,990
Okay, is it here?

4583
03:07:15,750 --> 03:07:16,990
No, I...

4584
03:07:16,990 --> 03:07:19,230
Willingly stopped fighting him.

4585
03:07:26,150 --> 03:07:26,870
What the fuck am I?

4586
03:07:38,140 --> 03:07:38,820
Oh.

4587
03:07:39,160 --> 03:07:40,320
Second floor balcony.

4588
03:07:40,600 --> 03:07:40,740
Okay.

4589
03:07:51,350 --> 03:07:52,030
Here?

4590
03:07:58,470 --> 03:07:59,870
Madness, oh madness.

4591
03:08:04,090 --> 03:08:05,070
Where do I jump?

4592
03:08:05,230 --> 03:08:05,430
Here?

4593
03:08:07,450 --> 03:08:08,850
Oh, I guess I jump here.

4594
03:08:10,630 --> 03:08:11,150
Hello.

4595
03:08:11,630 --> 03:08:12,170
Hey, guys.

4596
03:08:13,170 --> 03:08:13,690
Friendly?

4597
03:08:14,110 --> 03:08:15,010
Come on, guys.

4598
03:08:15,030 --> 03:08:15,870
I'm one of you.

4599
03:08:16,770 --> 03:08:17,090
Whoa.

4600
03:08:17,690 --> 03:08:18,210
Whoa!

4601
03:08:19,610 --> 03:08:20,350
Oh, God.

4602
03:08:20,430 --> 03:08:21,590
These guys are definitely not friendly.

4603
03:08:22,030 --> 03:08:22,550
Oh, God.

4604
03:08:22,750 --> 03:08:23,210
Oh, God.

4605
03:08:24,970 --> 03:08:25,490
Whoa!

4606
03:08:25,850 --> 03:08:26,510
Okay, we're fine.

4607
03:08:28,290 --> 03:08:29,470
Let's have to parkour a little.

4608
03:08:32,330 --> 03:08:33,490
Okay, not here.

4609
03:08:35,430 --> 03:08:36,370
Hey, where do I go?

4610
03:08:39,690 --> 03:08:41,470
Because these guys do not look friendly.

4611
03:08:44,090 --> 03:08:44,530
Whoa!

4612
03:08:46,190 --> 03:08:47,070
To the right.

4613
03:08:47,190 --> 03:08:47,690
Oh, right here.

4614
03:08:47,770 --> 03:08:48,170
I see it.

4615
03:08:48,330 --> 03:08:48,990
I see the tunnel.

4616
03:08:52,450 --> 03:08:52,890
Alright.

4617
03:08:53,170 --> 03:08:53,790
Here we go.

4618
03:08:57,010 --> 03:08:58,130
I guess I...

4619
03:08:58,130 --> 03:08:59,050
Drop down.

4620
03:09:03,530 --> 03:09:03,970
Alright.

4621
03:09:08,300 --> 03:09:08,740
Alright.

4622
03:09:08,740 --> 03:09:09,760
There's no horse ahead.

4623
03:09:16,890 --> 03:09:17,550
Oh.

4624
03:09:18,970 --> 03:09:20,090
Where am I?

4625
03:09:22,090 --> 03:09:23,510
Wait, I'm back here.

4626
03:09:24,010 --> 03:09:24,290
God!

4627
03:09:25,290 --> 03:09:26,430
I went back.

4628
03:09:28,260 --> 03:09:29,270
I dropped down.

4629
03:09:29,930 --> 03:09:31,050
I'm so lost.

4630
03:09:31,230 --> 03:09:32,630
I hate this place.

4631
03:09:33,090 --> 03:09:35,110
Why did I join her stupid cult?

4632
03:09:37,970 --> 03:09:43,310
Why didn't she give me a map after I joined her goddamn stupid fucking cult?

4633
03:09:48,670 --> 03:09:49,310
Okay.

4634
03:09:51,730 --> 03:09:52,690
Okay, guys.

4635
03:09:53,430 --> 03:09:56,690
Give me a detailed instruction on where to go.

4636
03:09:57,830 --> 03:09:59,910
Let's use cardinal directions.

4637
03:10:00,290 --> 03:10:02,350
Thank you for the super chat.

4638
03:10:02,530 --> 03:10:02,770
Thank you.

4639
03:10:02,890 --> 03:10:03,270
Thank you.

4640
03:10:03,470 --> 03:10:05,770
There's southwest, north, and east.

4641
03:10:06,370 --> 03:10:06,910
Where...

4642
03:10:13,470 --> 03:10:13,790
East.

4643
03:10:14,430 --> 03:10:14,590
Okay.

4644
03:10:17,310 --> 03:10:18,430
I'll go east.

4645
03:10:19,430 --> 03:10:20,890
Wait, east and jump down?

4646
03:10:21,190 --> 03:10:22,190
But that's a cliff.

4647
03:10:26,070 --> 03:10:26,710
Here?

4648
03:10:30,550 --> 03:10:31,630
Oh, here!

4649
03:10:32,290 --> 03:10:33,210
Oh, I didn't see that.

4650
03:10:33,930 --> 03:10:35,750
I didn't see the little nook right there.

4651
03:10:38,970 --> 03:10:39,450
Okay.

4652
03:10:39,890 --> 03:10:40,690
Now we're here.

4653
03:10:45,750 --> 03:10:46,990
And then I parkour.

4654
03:10:48,930 --> 03:10:49,850
Oh my god.

4655
03:10:49,950 --> 03:10:50,430
No, it's her.

4656
03:10:51,610 --> 03:10:52,770
Oh my god, it's her.

4657
03:10:56,190 --> 03:10:56,670
Okay.

4658
03:10:57,310 --> 03:10:58,210
We made it.

4659
03:10:58,410 --> 03:10:58,930
Where the...

4660
03:10:58,930 --> 03:10:59,190
What?

4661
03:11:00,210 --> 03:11:00,690
Oh!

4662
03:11:01,390 --> 03:11:02,170
Oh my god.

4663
03:11:02,170 --> 03:11:02,550
I'm...

4664
03:11:02,550 --> 03:11:02,990
Oh!

4665
03:11:03,670 --> 03:11:04,950
Oh my god!

4666
03:11:05,730 --> 03:11:07,170
I missed the one hole.

4667
03:11:07,450 --> 03:11:10,050
I missed the one fucky hole.

4668
03:11:19,190 --> 03:11:21,110
Okay, I just want to be sure what's down there.

4669
03:11:23,130 --> 03:11:24,390
Okay, now I'm here.

4670
03:11:25,490 --> 03:11:26,590
Where the fuck am I?

4671
03:11:27,910 --> 03:11:28,530
Wait, she...

4672
03:11:28,530 --> 03:11:29,050
He has a...

4673
03:11:29,050 --> 03:11:30,490
He has a lava sword.

4674
03:11:31,170 --> 03:11:32,050
Wait, what the fuck?

4675
03:11:34,230 --> 03:11:35,590
Oh my god, I'm on fire.

4676
03:11:35,810 --> 03:11:36,650
I'm on fire.

4677
03:11:40,550 --> 03:11:41,110
It's fine.

4678
03:11:41,410 --> 03:11:42,570
At least it's not a whip.

4679
03:11:43,470 --> 03:11:45,150
Thank god, it's not a whip.

4680
03:11:51,280 --> 03:11:51,940
Okay, nice.

4681
03:11:55,390 --> 03:11:56,870
Wait, have I been here before?

4682
03:12:02,990 --> 03:12:04,310
Wait, I got a rare drop?

4683
03:12:07,410 --> 03:12:09,030
I didn't even notice that.

4684
03:12:09,030 --> 03:12:09,950
It's just that easy.

4685
03:12:10,430 --> 03:12:11,290
What can I say?

4686
03:12:11,330 --> 03:12:12,030
I'm just that good.

4687
03:12:12,810 --> 03:12:13,870
Oh, it's right here.

4688
03:12:16,170 --> 03:12:17,430
It's that good, guys.

4689
03:12:19,870 --> 03:12:21,890
He got the first drop.

4690
03:12:23,070 --> 03:12:24,410
I'm just kidding.

4691
03:12:24,750 --> 03:12:25,510
What can I say?

4692
03:12:31,040 --> 03:12:32,520
Oh, this is back to the church.

4693
03:12:32,900 --> 03:12:33,760
Oh, I got the shortcut.

4694
03:12:37,770 --> 03:12:39,370
Yeah, look at that.

4695
03:12:39,830 --> 03:12:40,790
First try.

4696
03:12:42,870 --> 03:12:44,370
You guys want to see it?

4697
03:12:45,150 --> 03:12:46,190
Look at that.

4698
03:12:47,250 --> 03:12:48,910
The man's surface shield.

4699
03:12:53,590 --> 03:12:57,390
Some people drown while others die of thirst.

4700
03:12:59,590 --> 03:13:00,290
You want to see it?

4701
03:13:00,530 --> 03:13:04,710
It just took me one try to get this.

4702
03:13:05,570 --> 03:13:06,590
And what?

4703
03:13:06,810 --> 03:13:08,310
Like it's hard or something?

4704
03:13:13,990 --> 03:13:15,830
Maybe I should sell it, too.

4705
03:13:18,590 --> 03:13:19,230
Yeah.

4706
03:13:20,470 --> 03:13:21,110
What?

4707
03:13:21,250 --> 03:13:23,030
Like it was hard or something, guys?

4708
03:13:26,750 --> 03:13:27,970
No big deal.

4709
03:13:28,410 --> 03:13:29,790
Just a silly sword.

4710
03:13:48,870 --> 03:13:49,770
Oh, my God.

4711
03:13:50,350 --> 03:13:52,010
I almost thought he was going to eat me again.

4712
03:13:53,410 --> 03:13:53,990
There we go.

4713
03:13:54,770 --> 03:13:55,870
What if I just get it again?

4714
03:13:56,130 --> 03:13:56,830
Can you get it double?

4715
03:13:57,970 --> 03:14:01,490
It might be fucked up if I just get it again, you know?

4716
03:14:03,730 --> 03:14:06,210
Oh, he does like poison damage when he dies.

4717
03:14:07,130 --> 03:14:08,490
Oh, I didn't even see that.

4718
03:14:09,070 --> 03:14:09,910
Oh, my God.

4719
03:14:10,010 --> 03:14:10,590
God damn it.

4720
03:14:10,630 --> 03:14:11,490
I thought I could roll it in.

4721
03:14:12,930 --> 03:14:14,550
Wait, that's a 1% drop?

4722
03:14:16,670 --> 03:14:18,270
Wait, it's 0.5.

4723
03:14:23,110 --> 03:14:25,250
You know I don't deserve that, too.

4724
03:14:25,690 --> 03:14:28,550
I did not deserve that drop as well.

4725
03:14:28,670 --> 03:14:30,330
That's the most fucked up fight.

4726
03:14:30,810 --> 03:14:31,330
And I won.

4727
03:14:33,450 --> 03:14:34,270
You know?

4728
03:14:34,850 --> 03:14:35,590
Oh, shit.

4729
03:14:35,590 --> 03:14:36,270
It's a fire.

4730
03:14:36,430 --> 03:14:36,850
Shit.

4731
03:14:37,030 --> 03:14:38,030
It's a fire whip.

4732
03:14:41,110 --> 03:14:41,890
Oh, my God.

4733
03:14:41,990 --> 03:14:42,330
That's it.

4734
03:14:42,410 --> 03:14:43,570
I'm using him.

4735
03:14:43,970 --> 03:14:44,670
Oh, my God.

4736
03:14:48,650 --> 03:14:49,910
I don't care.

4737
03:14:50,290 --> 03:14:51,430
I don't care.

4738
03:14:52,630 --> 03:14:54,470
I cannot deal with...

4739
03:14:54,470 --> 03:14:59,190
I cannot deal with fire and whip at the same time.

4740
03:15:01,510 --> 03:15:02,830
Oh, my God.

4741
03:15:03,510 --> 03:15:04,910
I gloated too much.

4742
03:15:05,030 --> 03:15:06,390
I need to make sure I don't die to him.

4743
03:15:06,810 --> 03:15:07,170
I glo...

4744
03:15:13,070 --> 03:15:17,230
I have to make sure I can't die to him.

4745
03:15:17,230 --> 03:15:18,390
I'm already gloated too much.

4746
03:15:18,530 --> 03:15:19,830
I already gloated too much.

4747
03:15:19,930 --> 03:15:20,830
I can't die to him.

4748
03:15:22,570 --> 03:15:23,730
For the sake...

4749
03:15:23,730 --> 03:15:25,230
For the sake of this stream.

4750
03:15:27,610 --> 03:15:28,090
Nice.

4751
03:15:28,410 --> 03:15:28,890
I lived.

4752
03:15:30,730 --> 03:15:31,990
Behold, precious item.

4753
03:15:32,210 --> 03:15:32,450
Where?

4754
03:15:35,630 --> 03:15:36,610
Is there one here?

4755
03:15:40,860 --> 03:15:41,920
Or maybe here?

4756
03:15:44,180 --> 03:15:44,660
No?

4757
03:15:50,730 --> 03:15:51,550
It's down?

4758
03:15:51,770 --> 03:15:52,830
I don't want to go down.

4759
03:15:54,350 --> 03:15:56,450
It looks so dangerous, though.

4760
03:16:00,050 --> 03:16:01,970
Okay, let's see if there's a grace here.

4761
03:16:02,130 --> 03:16:03,810
And then I'll think about going down.

4762
03:16:11,600 --> 03:16:12,740
Oh, there's a shortcut.

4763
03:16:19,130 --> 03:16:19,690
Oh.

4764
03:16:24,890 --> 03:16:26,010
It's not...

4765
03:16:29,680 --> 03:16:31,680
Straight up, there's a room.

4766
03:16:34,660 --> 03:16:35,060
Okay.

4767
03:16:36,040 --> 03:16:37,380
How worth it is it?

4768
03:16:38,480 --> 03:16:39,420
Okay, I...

4769
03:16:39,420 --> 03:16:41,780
Like, I'm feeling a little scared to trust you guys.

4770
03:16:41,780 --> 03:16:44,060
Because I may or may not have gloated a bit too much.

4771
03:16:44,140 --> 03:16:45,920
And I feel like you guys want me to die.

4772
03:16:49,700 --> 03:16:51,680
I feel like...

4773
03:16:51,680 --> 03:16:54,660
I have a feeling you guys want me to die.

4774
03:16:58,880 --> 03:17:00,500
I don't know.

4775
03:17:01,000 --> 03:17:03,180
I don't know why I feel that.

4776
03:17:07,990 --> 03:17:09,430
May or may not...

4777
03:17:10,870 --> 03:17:13,190
I've been a little too cocky.

4778
03:17:13,190 --> 03:17:13,210
I've been a little too cocky.

4779
03:17:16,870 --> 03:17:18,070
Okay, I got rollo in.

4780
03:17:18,470 --> 03:17:19,610
What the fuck?

4781
03:17:19,790 --> 03:17:20,550
Where did he come from?

4782
03:17:23,890 --> 03:17:26,070
I'll get rid of the poison guys first.

4783
03:17:35,460 --> 03:17:37,240
Good job, Jellyfish.

4784
03:17:37,760 --> 03:17:38,780
For getting up.

4785
03:17:39,260 --> 03:17:40,380
For distracting him.

4786
03:17:40,620 --> 03:17:41,500
Appreciate it.

4787
03:17:44,480 --> 03:17:45,660
Oh, thank god.

4788
03:17:46,020 --> 03:17:46,160
Okay.

4789
03:17:52,940 --> 03:17:54,720
What the fuck is that?

4790
03:17:54,960 --> 03:17:56,040
There's two of them.

4791
03:17:56,980 --> 03:17:58,180
I don't even know.

4792
03:18:01,500 --> 03:18:03,640
Oh, I have to not beat him?

4793
03:18:03,640 --> 03:18:04,260
Alright, Gordon.

4794
03:18:04,380 --> 03:18:05,340
They give us a super chat.

4795
03:18:05,540 --> 03:18:05,820
Thank you.

4796
03:18:06,000 --> 03:18:06,540
Thank you.

4797
03:18:07,680 --> 03:18:08,380
This one?

4798
03:18:09,320 --> 03:18:09,960
Oh, hey.

4799
03:18:10,340 --> 03:18:10,980
Is this a dungeon?

4800
03:18:12,920 --> 03:18:13,740
What's over here?

4801
03:18:15,820 --> 03:18:16,920
Oh, I don't have enough.

4802
03:18:17,100 --> 03:18:17,640
God damn it.

4803
03:18:17,700 --> 03:18:18,080
I need two.

4804
03:18:20,680 --> 03:18:21,540
Grace close?

4805
03:18:24,160 --> 03:18:24,980
Where's the grace?

4806
03:18:29,110 --> 03:18:30,070
Past that guy?

4807
03:18:35,430 --> 03:18:37,910
Oh, it's past this portal?

4808
03:18:38,590 --> 03:18:39,690
Or past this church?

4809
03:18:39,870 --> 03:18:40,530
Oh, okay.

4810
03:18:43,190 --> 03:18:45,470
Oh, I need the key door.

4811
03:18:46,310 --> 03:18:47,010
Or fight.

4812
03:18:47,190 --> 03:18:47,950
Okay, I'll just fight him.

4813
03:18:48,230 --> 03:18:48,870
I might just run.

4814
03:18:51,970 --> 03:18:52,770
I mean...

4815
03:18:52,770 --> 03:18:53,610
Wait, what the fuck?

4816
03:18:53,710 --> 03:18:54,110
Why can't...

4817
03:18:54,110 --> 03:18:54,270
Oh.

4818
03:18:54,950 --> 03:18:55,730
Okay, I'll just run.

4819
03:19:00,450 --> 03:19:01,610
Oh my god, it's a nerd.

4820
03:19:01,830 --> 03:19:02,890
That's why he has such a big head.

4821
03:19:03,350 --> 03:19:04,630
That's where he stores all his magic.

4822
03:19:06,290 --> 03:19:06,690
Bye.

4823
03:19:13,690 --> 03:19:14,150
Okay.

4824
03:19:14,370 --> 03:19:14,450
Okay.

4825
03:19:14,450 --> 03:19:15,170
Oh, there it is.

4826
03:19:15,670 --> 03:19:17,770
Okay, so I shouldn't fight him.

4827
03:19:18,830 --> 03:19:19,290
Okay.

4828
03:19:20,670 --> 03:19:21,130
Alright.

4829
03:19:21,410 --> 03:19:22,090
Let me upgrade.

4830
03:19:22,330 --> 03:19:23,690
Let's see if I have any upgrades, actually.

4831
03:19:25,970 --> 03:19:26,840
Let's try and...

4832
03:19:28,590 --> 03:19:30,270
Jesus Christ, this map is huge.

4833
03:19:38,250 --> 03:19:40,470
Wait, am I supposed to...

4834
03:19:40,470 --> 03:19:42,490
Do a side quest first?

4835
03:19:45,210 --> 03:19:46,450
Go to a red spot.

4836
03:19:46,650 --> 03:19:46,790
Okay.

4837
03:19:47,090 --> 03:19:47,970
I'll go to the red spot.

4838
03:19:48,290 --> 03:19:49,890
Let me upgrade my stuff first.

4839
03:19:50,270 --> 03:19:51,590
I think I have enough to upgrade.

4840
03:19:52,590 --> 03:19:53,410
Oh, I do.

4841
03:19:53,790 --> 03:19:54,130
Yay!

4842
03:19:55,630 --> 03:19:57,650
My jellyfish is so strong now.

4843
03:20:00,470 --> 03:20:01,510
How about...

4844
03:20:01,510 --> 03:20:02,410
Okay, I need...

4845
03:20:02,410 --> 03:20:03,690
Fuck, I need six of those.

4846
03:20:03,690 --> 03:20:04,470
Because I don't have that.

4847
03:20:07,090 --> 03:20:07,610
Alright.

4848
03:20:07,810 --> 03:20:08,730
We'll do the side quest.

4849
03:20:08,930 --> 03:20:10,010
And then we'll call it then.

4850
03:20:12,230 --> 03:20:13,670
Where's the big red mark?

4851
03:20:18,870 --> 03:20:19,730
Is it these?

4852
03:20:25,150 --> 03:20:26,810
Oh, is side quest long?

4853
03:20:27,250 --> 03:20:28,130
Is it that?

4854
03:20:32,470 --> 03:20:33,610
Okay, never mind.

4855
03:20:35,270 --> 03:20:36,730
We'll call it here then.

4856
03:20:38,230 --> 03:20:39,750
It's incredibly long.

4857
03:20:40,070 --> 03:20:41,070
Because I know...

4858
03:20:41,070 --> 03:20:42,190
I remember this bridge.

4859
03:20:42,690 --> 03:20:44,890
That's where all the giant fucking trollers are.

4860
03:20:49,370 --> 03:20:51,490
Oh, I can't finish the side quest.

4861
03:20:51,690 --> 03:20:52,790
The other areas are locked.

4862
03:20:53,690 --> 03:20:54,710
Is it locked?

4863
03:20:54,950 --> 03:20:55,890
Okay, we'll...

4864
03:20:55,890 --> 03:20:57,010
We'll do the boss though.

4865
03:20:57,690 --> 03:20:58,910
We'll do the boss then.

4866
03:20:58,910 --> 03:20:59,550
If it's locked.

4867
03:21:00,530 --> 03:21:01,730
Where was it?

4868
03:21:17,430 --> 03:21:17,990
Okay.

4869
03:21:19,010 --> 03:21:19,290
Uh...

4870
03:21:31,630 --> 03:21:33,090
Wait, then what do I do?

4871
03:21:33,350 --> 03:21:35,350
People are saying I don't have the area yet.

4872
03:21:39,310 --> 03:21:40,490
Some people say I don't...

4873
03:21:40,490 --> 03:21:42,070
I don't have the area unlocked yet.

4874
03:21:42,270 --> 03:21:43,230
So do I do it or not?

4875
03:21:47,560 --> 03:21:48,400
I don't have the side quest.

4876
03:21:48,580 --> 03:21:52,120
But if I can't finish the side quest, then...

4877
03:21:52,120 --> 03:21:55,600
How do I finish side quest if one is unlocked?

4878
03:22:12,410 --> 03:22:14,930
What do I get out of it, chat?

4879
03:22:15,850 --> 03:22:20,510
Do I actually get something where I will actually change my equipment into?

4880
03:22:20,690 --> 03:22:22,710
Or is it just a collection?

4881
03:22:24,310 --> 03:22:29,330
Do I actually get something where I will actually use?

4882
03:22:30,610 --> 03:22:30,950
Or...

4883
03:22:31,290 --> 03:22:33,170
Or will I...

4884
03:22:33,170 --> 03:22:34,790
You just...

4885
03:22:36,370 --> 03:22:40,250
Yeah, but is it better than my katana right now?

4886
03:22:42,050 --> 03:22:43,850
A whip and a quilt...

4887
03:22:43,850 --> 03:22:45,170
Okay, but is the arm...

4888
03:22:45,170 --> 03:22:48,730
Is the armor better than what I have now?

4889
03:22:52,440 --> 03:22:53,720
But like, look at me.

4890
03:22:53,720 --> 03:22:55,700
I'm a fancy-ass knight.

4891
03:22:56,140 --> 03:22:57,820
Is it better than this armor?

4892
03:23:07,690 --> 03:23:08,770
Cool katana!

4893
03:23:09,270 --> 03:23:11,190
Okay, but is it better than this katana?

4894
03:23:17,310 --> 03:23:18,390
Looks-wise...

4895
03:23:18,390 --> 03:23:19,430
Look, I...

4896
03:23:19,430 --> 03:23:21,230
We're not here but looks.

4897
03:23:21,410 --> 03:23:22,030
We're here...

4898
03:23:22,030 --> 03:23:23,550
Stat-wise...

4899
03:23:23,550 --> 03:23:25,250
I just don't want to die.

4900
03:23:26,930 --> 03:23:28,010
Is it...

4901
03:23:29,050 --> 03:23:29,810
Is it better...

4902
03:23:29,810 --> 03:23:31,070
Is it better...

4903
03:23:31,070 --> 03:23:32,590
Stat-wise...

4904
03:23:32,590 --> 03:23:35,010
Is it better than this armor?

4905
03:23:35,290 --> 03:23:36,950
We're not here but drip, okay?

4906
03:23:37,230 --> 03:23:38,830
We're not here about drip.

4907
03:23:38,950 --> 03:23:40,110
We're here about stats.

4908
03:23:40,330 --> 03:23:41,650
We need to know.

4909
03:23:46,570 --> 03:23:49,610
Oh, wrong game for that ad.

4910
03:23:49,890 --> 03:23:51,910
I just want to be alive!

4911
03:23:51,910 --> 03:23:53,870
That's not what I want.

4912
03:23:56,670 --> 03:23:59,190
You put the drip, Toki.

4913
03:24:01,830 --> 03:24:03,010
Okay, we'll do...

4914
03:24:04,170 --> 03:24:06,070
Does the quest have a boss?

4915
03:24:07,510 --> 03:24:09,630
There's actually a way to get along in katana if you're interested.

4916
03:24:09,950 --> 03:24:13,270
Okay, but is it katana for nerds or is it katana for like...

4917
03:24:13,270 --> 03:24:14,110
Cool...

4918
03:24:14,110 --> 03:24:15,610
Cool bros like me.

4919
03:24:16,450 --> 03:24:17,190
Thank you, super chat.

4920
03:24:17,270 --> 03:24:18,190
Thank you, thank you.

4921
03:24:19,350 --> 03:24:19,750
No?

4922
03:24:20,150 --> 03:24:21,450
Okay, then we'll call it here.

4923
03:24:21,630 --> 03:24:25,210
I was gonna end on a boss but if there's no nearby boss then we'll call it here.

4924
03:24:30,530 --> 03:24:31,150
Alright.

4925
03:24:32,210 --> 03:24:34,130
I'm gonna call it here everybody.

4926
03:24:35,670 --> 03:24:38,270
I hope you guys enjoyed today's playthrough.

4927
03:24:39,110 --> 03:24:40,130
I can't guys!

4928
03:24:41,390 --> 03:24:44,490
People don't want me to lock my quest.

4929
03:24:44,750 --> 03:24:46,670
So we can't do this boss.

4930
03:24:46,790 --> 03:24:50,530
Because apparently if I do this boss it'll lock me out of a quest.

4931
03:24:50,530 --> 03:24:52,270
So, uh, we can't do it.

4932
03:24:52,330 --> 03:24:54,530
I know it's just begging for me to kill it too.

4933
03:24:54,770 --> 03:24:56,350
He's like right there.

4934
03:24:57,410 --> 03:24:59,650
He's like, come on, you know you wanna stab me.

4935
03:24:59,990 --> 03:25:03,390
Come on, come on, you know you want me to wanna stab.

4936
03:25:03,690 --> 03:25:04,650
You're so close to it.

4937
03:25:04,790 --> 03:25:05,670
I can't.

4938
03:25:06,010 --> 03:25:06,810
I can't.

4939
03:25:06,810 --> 03:25:08,070
I can't stab him.

4940
03:25:08,690 --> 03:25:09,050
Unfortunately.

4941
03:25:10,910 --> 03:25:11,270
Uh...

4942
03:25:11,270 --> 03:25:12,470
Right, thank you for the super chat.

4943
03:25:12,590 --> 03:25:13,330
Thank you, thank you.

4944
03:25:13,450 --> 03:25:14,630
Thanks for the stream, Toki.

4945
03:25:14,650 --> 03:25:16,470
I'm sorry, I swear it wasn't on purpose.

4946
03:25:16,890 --> 03:25:18,250
Anyway, the outfit looks great.

4947
03:25:18,350 --> 03:25:19,250
Thank you for the super chat.

4948
03:25:19,250 --> 03:25:20,310
Thank you, thank you.

4949
03:25:20,650 --> 03:25:22,470
Alright guys, we're gonna call it here.

4950
03:25:22,770 --> 03:25:26,190
Because we're gonna have a long Halo stream next time, tomorrow.

4951
03:25:26,790 --> 03:25:28,490
Uh, I don't know how I'll finish Halo tomorrow.

4952
03:25:28,490 --> 03:25:30,450
But we'll see how many chapters we can get.

4953
03:25:30,590 --> 03:25:32,250
But thank you all for coming everybody.

4954
03:25:32,990 --> 03:25:35,310
Um, after my birthday next week.

4955
03:25:35,510 --> 03:25:38,110
We can have, um, Zatsudon streams again.

4956
03:25:38,270 --> 03:25:39,590
Because now I can finally chill.

4957
03:25:40,030 --> 03:25:42,490
Um, I'm trying not to like use up too much of my voice.

4958
03:25:42,590 --> 03:25:45,150
Because I still have some more stuff to do.

4959
03:25:45,350 --> 03:25:46,390
Like recording wise.

4960
03:25:46,610 --> 03:25:48,530
And like practicing for the concert and everything.

4961
03:25:48,530 --> 03:25:49,430
Which sucks.

4962
03:25:49,510 --> 03:25:51,790
Because I really want to like talk to you guys more after.

4963
03:25:52,030 --> 03:25:53,230
Like post game streams.

4964
03:25:53,710 --> 03:25:55,850
But after my birthday, I can do post game.

4965
03:25:55,850 --> 03:25:57,510
Like post game Zatsudons again.

4966
03:25:57,930 --> 03:25:58,490
Anyway guys.

4967
03:25:58,670 --> 03:25:59,430
As always everybody.

4968
03:25:59,770 --> 03:26:00,550
Stay hydrated.

4969
03:26:00,790 --> 03:26:01,310
Posture check.

4970
03:26:01,570 --> 03:26:03,250
Get everyone around to get that blood flowing.

4971
03:26:03,530 --> 03:26:04,590
And if you suffer me.

4972
03:26:04,790 --> 03:26:05,510
Head to bed.

4973
03:26:05,650 --> 03:26:07,050
Because you deserve it.

4974
03:26:07,250 --> 03:26:08,790
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

4975
03:26:09,330 --> 03:26:10,070
Bye guys.

4976
03:26:10,530 --> 03:26:11,010
Bye.

4977
03:26:13,450 --> 03:26:13,930
Bye.

4978
03:26:13,930 --> 03:26:13,970
Bye.
