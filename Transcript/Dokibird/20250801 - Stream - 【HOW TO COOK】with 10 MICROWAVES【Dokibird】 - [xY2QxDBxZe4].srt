1
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,180
Wow!

2
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,180
Hello, everybody!

3
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,120
Hello!

4
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,760
Hello!

5
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,940
We have a special guest here today that's gonna help me cook.

6
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,080
And teach you guys how to cook with 10 microwaves.

7
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,560
Can you guys count them right now?

8
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,680
10 micro... I feel like Dora the Explorer right now.

9
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,020
Vambanos, everybody!

10
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,300
Can you see 10 microwaves, chat?

11
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,260
How many microwaves are there?

12
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:15,720
1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8... 10!

13
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,060
10 microwaves!

14
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,400
Hello!

15
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,900
We have a special guest here today that's gonna help us cook with our 10 microwaves.

16
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,320
Why don't you introduce yourself?

17
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,460
Hi, so my name is Tim and I am the microwave cook.

18
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:35,580
Yes.

19
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:40,380
As you might have seen, the tomato sacrificed his life for us to be here.

20
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,940
Oh wait, you're wearing him!

21
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,700
You're right!

22
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,180
You're wearing that tomato gas!

23
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,560
So, this is...

24
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,240
And today, we're gonna prove that microwaves can do anything!

25
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,360
Whoa!

26
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,060
Anything?

27
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,200
What do you have planned for us, Tim?

28
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,540
We're gonna fry with it?

29
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,100
We're going to cook a whole chicken?

30
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,040
Wait, you can fry with Tim?

31
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,120
You can fry with microwaves?

32
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,680
I thought you just pressed start.

33
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,100
That's what we're gonna do.

34
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,980
Okay, what else are we gonna do, Tim?

35
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,320
I'm gonna cook a whole chicken.

36
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,720
You're gonna cook a...

37
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:13,820
We're gonna...

38
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:14,300
You know what?

39
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,000
We're gonna get started with that right now!

40
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,400
Wait, isn't that chicken raw?

41
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,660
Wait, is that healthy?

42
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,140
Is that sanitary?

43
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,260
Tim's kinda...

44
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:22,920
Don't worry, guys.

45
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,640
I've upped Tim a little bit.

46
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:25,960
Don't worry.

47
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,600
I'm a professional.

48
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,780
You're a professional?

49
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,780
Wait, do you have a degree?

50
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,580
Wait, what are you doing?

51
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,680
What are you doing right now?

52
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,280
Technically!

53
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,440
Why are you putting cows on top of a chicken?

54
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,120
Technically, I do have a degree.

55
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,800
I did actually graduate from culinary school.

56
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,840
And then cooked at a Michelin-style restaurant.

57
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,200
With a microwave?

58
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:46,800
Technically, yes.

59
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,560
No, look.

60
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,780
They hated microwaves when I was cooking.

61
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,400
And... and...

62
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,520
Wait, which restaurant so I know not to go?

63
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,400
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

64
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,160
You'll see.

65
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:01,860
You'll see.

66
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:06,480
I'm just saying, I didn't pay $80 for a microwave meal.

67
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,100
Like, I might as well eat it at home.

68
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:14,520
So, today, I'm gonna prove that microwaves are so underrated.

69
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,880
And it is going to cook a perfect chicken.

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,820
We're even gonna crisp salmon skin with it.

71
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:21,340
What?

72
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,220
And we're also...

73
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,960
We're gonna make kainani's chicken rice.

74
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,300
We're gonna make salmon.

75
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,200
We're gonna make clam chowder.

76
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:27,560
What?

77
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,740
We're gonna make lobster.

78
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,940
Lobster in a microwave?

79
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,400
Also dessert.

80
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,400
Will you eat it live on stream, too?

81
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:35,180
Uh-huh.

82
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,320
And I'm gonna feed those guys.

83
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,400
Oh, nice.

84
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,920
You're gonna feed your camera crew.

85
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,800
Wait, is this an information?

86
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:43,780
Hey, y 'all are on insurance, right?

87
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,560
I hope they are.

88
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,440
So, this whole chicken...

89
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,040
Yeah?

90
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,140
...is gonna go in the microwave.

91
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,660
And I'm gonna start it now because it's gonna take 40 minutes.

92
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,100
Wait.

93
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:55,760
We're gonna...

94
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,000
What?

95
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,240
So, what you do...

96
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,220
What you do with this is...

97
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:04,320
The reason why we're covering with a paper towel is because the way microwaves work...

98
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:04,980
Uh-huh.

99
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:05,900
...is they basically...

100
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:11,040
They basically beam the microwave energy down into the water.

101
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,220
And then the water just vibrates really fast.

102
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,480
And that's what makes it hot.

103
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,140
Oh!

104
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:18,200
When it vibrates really fast, it gets heat.

105
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,420
Just like how friction will cause heat.

106
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,980
And then, because of that, the water will start to steam out.

107
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:24,640
Oh!

108
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,300
And if we wrap paper towels around it, then it won't escape.

109
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,340
And it'll keep everything moist.

110
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,200
I'm not gonna season this right now.

111
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,360
We'll do that later.

112
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,820
If I season it right now, it might actually...

113
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,420
But if we...

114
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:39,700
The temperature of it would shorten the time to do the chicken?

115
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,180
Yes.

116
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,740
Actually, microwaves are one of the most efficient ways to cook.

117
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,780
Almost 100% of the energy goes directly into the food.

118
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,600
So...

119
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,620
Can we shorten it to like 20 minutes?

120
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,200
Um, yeah.

121
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,880
Technically, with a microwave powerful enough.

122
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:54,320
Yeah.

123
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,560
Which actually...

124
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:55,880
Do we have that?

125
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:56,400
At the...

126
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:57,940
Yes.

127
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,800
At the Vite facility.

128
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,540
We have an industrial microwave that I actually built myself.

129
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:02,380
Oh!

130
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,440
That's what DIGs are noodles.

131
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:03,780
Bring it!

132
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:04,540
Oh my God!

133
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:04,800
Wait!

134
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,260
Bring it!

135
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,860
I want to add that into our cooking show!

136
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,020
Add that in!

137
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,000
Next time...

138
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,080
Next time...

139
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:11,900
Next time we'll cook...

140
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,260
You don't have your industrial microwave here?

141
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:18,000
What's the point of bringing 10 microwaves and you don't have the best microwave?

142
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:18,860
What?

143
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:19,700
Okay.

144
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,600
So...

145
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,260
A little...

146
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,100
A little secret...

147
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:23,200
Okay.

148
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,360
I'm actually going to toss this in real quick because it's going to take 40 minutes.

149
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:25,980
Okay.

150
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:26,740
But...

151
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,520
A little secret...

152
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,520
Oh, I love the microwaves, guys.

153
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,900
A little secret about...

154
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,680
I'm just going to have to keep resetting this, I think.

155
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,080
Yeah, we're just going to...

156
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:42,660
A little secret about how we prototyped before we actually built the industrial microwave.

157
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:46,040
And the reason I have so many here right now is because...

158
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,980
Is that 20 minutes?

159
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:47,440
Oh, yeah.

160
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,780
Why do you have so many microwaves here?

161
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,960
Before we could test with the real regular microwave.

162
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,160
Or with the industrial microwave.

163
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:58,900
Uh-huh.

164
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,840
We tested with 20 small ones to see if it would work.

165
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,720
So, some of these have had their insides gutted out and everything.

166
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,080
And then built back together.

167
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,020
Oh!

168
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:11,800
Wait.

169
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,120
That doesn't sound safe.

170
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,920
Wouldn't the radiation escape from the microwaves?

171
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,860
So, microwave radiation is actually one of the safest kinds.

172
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,420
It is like visible light.

173
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:21,880
Yeah.

174
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,700
Just like how...

175
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,820
Just light doesn't hurt you.

176
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,520
Unless you're a gremlin.

177
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,720
Which doesn't go outside.

178
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,540
Then it might hurt you a little bit.

179
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,020
But otherwise, the microwaves...

180
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,640
The only thing it will do is make you warm.

181
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,480
But what if we had 20 microwaves running at the same time?

182
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,660
Is that still safe?

183
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,780
Hey, you want to run all 10 microwaves at the same time?

184
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,580
Do we have all the water in here?

185
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:40,700
I'm sure.

186
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:40,880
Okay.

187
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:41,760
Let's do it.

188
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,400
We're gonna run.

189
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,800
I mean, I'm not the one that's gonna get cancer.

190
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,020
Oh my god, guys!

191
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,920
He's gonna give us entire crew cancer!

192
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,700
That's so fucked up!

193
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,600
All right.

194
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:02,200
If the power blows out, then...

195
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:03,640
Yeah.

196
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,120
I already got paid, guys, if the power blows out.

197
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,100
That's fine for me.

198
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:12,010
All right.

199
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,290
So we're gonna cook that chicken over there.

200
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,430
And this one, we're gonna make Hainanese chicken rice.

201
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,090
And we're also gonna make rice in the microwave.

202
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,190
Everything is gonna be done.

203
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,810
And we're gonna be doing this with the Doki Blade.

204
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:21,510
Yeah!

205
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:22,350
By the way!

206
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:23,890
Oh, so he forgot to...

207
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:25,530
By the way, we forgot to say this is...

208
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,410
This is a collab with White Robin!

209
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:28,830
Look at that!

210
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:29,850
That's my blade!

211
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,130
The Doki Blade!

212
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:33,990
We forgot the most important part of the introduction.

213
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:37,690
Look at that there!

214
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,490
They have iron sights, guys!

215
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:40,490
Isn't that cool?

216
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:43,490
You can technically throw your knife accurately at people.

217
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,650
I mean, at food.

218
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:46,570
That's what I mean.

219
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,910
At food, guys.

220
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,190
Show them the iron sight, Tim!

221
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,630
Do you see the iron sight, dragons?

222
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:01,990
Do you see the iron sights?

223
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,430
Oh, that looks sick.

224
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,730
But yeah, it has my signature and everything, too.

225
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:12,930
Alright.

226
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,230
Oh, my gosh.

227
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:14,830
Are you okay?

228
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:16,130
Oh, it's...

229
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:19,770
It's just gonna drop a lot.

230
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:20,770
Alright.

231
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,250
So, we're gonna go...

232
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,130
We're gonna go and break down this chicken.

233
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:24,810
Uh-huh.

234
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:29,410
And then we're gonna poach it in the microwave and use the sock in order to cook the rice.

235
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:29,850
Okay.

236
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,350
And normally, it would take a really long time to cook the chicken, right?

237
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:32,930
But...

238
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:34,270
And we're just gonna go fast.

239
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,070
I'm just gonna cut down the backbone over here.

240
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:36,730
Right?

241
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:37,550
We have the neck.

242
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:38,650
Yeah.

243
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,790
And we're just gonna break it down into parts.

244
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:42,750
So, joint here.

245
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:43,170
Cut.

246
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:44,150
Ooh!

247
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,950
Guys, look at that professional go.

248
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:48,070
Boom.

249
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:49,390
Here's your wing.

250
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:52,310
Look how sharp my blade is, guys!

251
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,830
You can get it right now.

252
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,230
The white ramen shop.

253
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,130
Look at that.

254
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:58,210
Look at...

255
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:00,090
You can do that to your chicken, too.

256
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:03,310
This guy cooks.

257
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:03,730
I know.

258
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:04,750
Look at him go.

259
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:05,530
Right?

260
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,770
And then make sure we wanna get the oyster over here.

261
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:08,550
In the back.

262
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:09,310
One, two.

263
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:10,130
Cut.

264
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:11,850
Ooh!

265
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,290
Pop that joint.

266
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:13,790
Cut.

267
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:15,830
And cut.

268
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:16,630
Boom.

269
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:17,750
There's your side and leg.

270
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,650
He knows how to cut a chicken.

271
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:20,530
Boom.

272
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:23,750
Make sure we get the oyster.

273
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,650
So, this over here in the back is called oyster.

274
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:28,930
This is basically the tenderloin of the chicken.

275
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:30,710
And this is known as the chest treat.

276
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:31,330
Yep.

277
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:32,870
Wait, why is it called oyster?

278
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,090
If that's a chicken?

279
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,410
Because it looks like an oyster, I guess.

280
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:37,270
I actually don't know.

281
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:38,550
Yeah.

282
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,390
Here's what it looks like.

283
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:40,750
Zoom.

284
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,270
Zoom in on that cameraman.

285
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:43,510
Cameraman.

286
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:43,870
Zoom.

287
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:44,730
Zoom in.

288
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:45,770
Guys, he's...

289
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,830
I think your cameraman got cancer or something because he's not zooming.

290
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:49,690
Terrence!

291
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:50,470
From the radiation.

292
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:52,090
There we go.

293
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:53,030
I think...

294
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:56,890
I think your cameraman may or may not have got hit by the radiation.

295
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:58,010
That...

296
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:58,290
Terrence!

297
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,350
Terrence, are you okay?

298
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,850
That does not look like an...

299
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,070
You know what that looks like?

300
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,110
That sort of...

301
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:09,990
Wait, why isn't he wearing gloves?

302
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,190
Wait a minute.

303
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,350
Why isn't Tim wearing gloves?

304
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:13,990
What?

305
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,130
Because gloves...

306
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:18,370
Because gloves are actually- Fun fact.

307
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:22,770
Did you know that gloves actually spread more food-borne illness than not wearing gloves?

308
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:25,690
But that's what the cafeteria ladies wear.

309
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:27,770
Yeah one of the biggest...

310
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,190
Of the biggest issues with...

311
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,870
One of the biggest issues with wearing gloves.

312
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,810
Is people wear the gloves and then don't wash their hands.

313
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:37,630
Because they can't feel all the stickiness and stuff on the thing.

314
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:41,070
Well-washed, clean hands are significantly better than gloves.

315
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:44,870
And that's actually one of the biggest problems in foodborne illness.

316
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:48,330
When people forget to wash their hands because of...

317
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:50,350
Wait, that's how people get food poisoning?

318
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,830
Yeah, a lot of times.

319
00:11:52,990 --> 00:12:00,090
And this is especially in fast food, where people will wear gloves, and then they go to the bathroom, and then they don't change their gloves.

320
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:00,690
Wait!

321
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:00,890
Wait!

322
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,620
Yeah, but if you...

323
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:08,250
Wait a minute!

324
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,550
That sounds bad!

325
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,030
Yeah, not great!

326
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:23,370
And so that's why a lot of gloves, a lot of incidents of foodborne illness just tend to be from people wearing gloves, and not forgetting to change it.

327
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:31,070
But if you go to the bathroom, and then you're not wearing gloves, then, well, hopefully most people will know, you're supposed to wash your hands.

328
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:34,030
Oh, guys, remember, wash your hands.

329
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:37,490
You can handle your food without wearing gloves, guys.

330
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,410
Just remember to wash your hands.

331
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,250
What the fuck was that?

332
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,690
I felt... Oh, that's your earpiece.

333
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:49,070
It's like, oh my god, the chicken had black things inside it.

334
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:50,550
I don't think that's the safe chicken.

335
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,190
What the hell is beeping?

336
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:53,490
Oh!

337
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:54,910
Your 20 microwaves?

338
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:56,690
My 20 microwaves.

339
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:01,770
Guys, I think this Tim guy's a poser.

340
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:05,450
How does he not know what a microwave beep sounds like?

341
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,950
I'm just so used to it.

342
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,810
The microwaves are just there all the time.

343
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,590
They're like little lullabies, right?

344
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:14,970
When they beep all the time, that's what puts me to sleep.

345
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:16,050
That's how I sleep.

346
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,450
That's the secret of good sleep, by the way.

347
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:20,930
Get 10 microwaves, run them all for a minute, and just let the beeps put you to sleep.

348
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,470
Oh, yeah, run them all in your room, right?

349
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:29,090
Make sure it lines up all your walls, too, and have it, like, face your bed when you're heading to sleep.

350
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,190
Including your industrial microwave.

351
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:33,910
Absolutely.

352
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,650
So, what we're going to do is we're going to make Hananese chicken.

353
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:37,430
Yay!

354
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,670
I love Hananese chicken.

355
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:47,990
So, we're going to put all the dark meat in here, so that it doesn't, uh, um, uh, because the, the, well, actually, you know what?

356
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:48,230
Fuck it.

357
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:49,110
Everything's going in.

358
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:49,710
That's fine.

359
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,150
Wait, why fuck it?

360
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:51,970
Wait a minute.

361
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:54,670
Are you, are you half-assing this?

362
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:57,010
Are you half-assing the food?

363
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,210
The titties are too big.

364
00:13:59,570 --> 00:13:59,970
Oh.

365
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:03,350
I was going to say, we're going to put everything in, but the titties are too big, so.

366
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:03,870
Oh, no.

367
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,570
Oh, Matt's a busty chicken.

368
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:06,930
Yeah, right?

369
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,170
She lived a good life.

370
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:12,770
Oh, my God.

371
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:13,330
All right.

372
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,090
So, what do we have to do?

373
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:15,530
All right, Toki.

374
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:16,590
Do you like thighs?

375
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,710
You, you, you like thighs or breasts better?

376
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:21,950
I think, like, why not both, you know?

377
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:25,450
Why, why, why pick when you can have two at the...

378
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:27,450
That's why God gave us two arms.

379
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,050
And two hands.

380
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:30,630
One on each part.

381
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:33,710
All right.

382
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:38,090
And the important thing, after handling raw chicken, you wash your hands.

383
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:38,610
Yeah.

384
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,030
All of this, it gets washed.

385
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:42,510
Okay.

386
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,190
That's the important part.

387
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,440
He's washing, guys.

388
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:52,040
Now we know that he's not going to give people food poisoning, because he's washing his hands, Chad.

389
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,480
And I got to turn off all the microwaves.

390
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,400
So we're going to go ahead and put a lot of water in this.

391
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,800
And then we're just going to go ahead and microwave it.

392
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,480
And that's going to give us chicken stock.

393
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:09,660
Because the microwave does not go very quickly, or it doesn't overheat.

394
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:19,640
We have no problems with burning, and it will cook it nice and gentle and give us that nice poach that Hai Nani chicken rice deserves.

395
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,560
Oh, is that for like the rice?

396
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,000
That's for the rice, yeah?

397
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:23,900
Yup.

398
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,440
So we're going to make that stock in here, with the water.

399
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:26,760
Yeah!

400
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,260
Can you make rice in a microwave?

401
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,180
Yup, and that's what we're doing right next.

402
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,480
We're going to make rice!

403
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,880
Guys, I told you, we don't need a rice cooker.

404
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,900
Do you not have a rice cooker?

405
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,400
We don't need a rice cooker, guys!

406
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,100
Oh my god.

407
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,020
All I need is a microwave!

408
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,100
We're going to learn today, Chad!

409
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:45,640
Shut the open.

410
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:45,720
Hang on.

411
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,300
We're going to learn today.

412
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:47,900
Oh my god.

413
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,160
No, he literally said we don't need our rice cooker, Chad.

414
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,100
We can do this.

415
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,620
He's proving... Oh look, there's a doki board!

416
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:59,260
Yep.

417
00:15:59,260 --> 00:15:59,920
It's right there.

418
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:04,360
So we're just gonna go ahead and, you know, because this is all going in the same place anyway.

419
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,680
We're gonna go...

420
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:08,900
Scallions, uh...

421
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,700
Scallions, I'm just gonna go with a shallot over here.

422
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,700
You'll note that I'm still being very careful with how I do this.

423
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,820
Close this so you guys can actually see.

424
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,740
And then, uh...

425
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,540
Here, let's show off the uh... let's show off the knife a little bit.

426
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,320
I'm gonna do a boom walk.

427
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,120
So this is the fancy chef shit.

428
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,140
Oh my god, can anyone do the fancy chef shit?

429
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:32,820
Yeah, you just gotta practice a lot and then your chefs yell at you a lot until you cry enough and...

430
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:34,280
Yay!

431
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,000
Abuse is okay sometimes, guys.

432
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,340
You heard that from Tim.

433
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:39,840
Wait, well...

434
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,240
Abuse works.

435
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,480
ENDORSED BY TIM, THE CEO OF VITE RAMEN, BY THE WAY.

436
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,700
I'M BEING FRIENDS!

437
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,840
I'M BEING FRIENDS, GUYS!

438
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,360
Look at him!

439
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,980
And then you can do fancy shit like this!

440
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:07,040
You know, in retrospect, having everything be all chickeny and slippery was not the best idea.

441
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:07,900
That's good!

442
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,760
Wait, but at least it's good food.

443
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,080
Look at that, guys!

444
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,000
His...

445
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,040
His...

446
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,340
His boss yelled at him, so now he can do this.

447
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:18,780
This is not the best.

448
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:19,940
Not the best food in the world.

449
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:20,540
It's fine.

450
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,340
We're talking...

451
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,640
We're chucking it in.

452
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:23,400
It's fine.

453
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:23,620
Don't worry about it.

454
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,960
Yeah, that knife is so sharp, guys.

455
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,700
That's a real Doki blade.

456
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,140
Yeah, I can't even shave with it.

457
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:29,680
Wait, really?

458
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,280
Do it right now.

459
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:30,560
Can you get this?

460
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,020
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

461
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,220
Can I get band chat if he...

462
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,280
Guys, don't do this at home!

463
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,420
Guys, for legal...

464
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,550
Listen, he is a professional!

465
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:43,180
Do not do this at home!

466
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:45,260
Wait, are you gonna wash the knife before you cut more?

467
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,200
Yes!

468
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,500
Yes, I'm gonna wash the knife before I cut more!

469
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,040
What?

470
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:50,800
What?

471
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:52,440
What?

472
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:52,620
Nice!

473
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,640
The seasoning is Tim's hair, guys.

474
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:56,320
Yeah.

475
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,320
The extra seasoning.

476
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:58,760
A lot of...

477
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,020
Look, hey, Doki, look.

478
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,800
A lot of people would pay extra for that, okay?

479
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:02,480
Wait.

480
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,720
A lot of people would pay extra for that.

481
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,840
Is that what you did at your Michelin star restaurant, too?

482
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,580
Yeah, absolutely.

483
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,140
Actually, uh...

484
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:11,660
But you add these secret ingredients and you start shaving your arm.

485
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,800
Little known fact, we actually started...

486
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,600
We actually started...

487
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,440
Pioneered the OnlyFans model of Michelin star restaurants.

488
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:20,840
Ooh!

489
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,040
Where we would...

490
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,820
You know, we would do all kinds of stuff.

491
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,340
Or we'd include body parts and other things upon request.

492
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,760
Oh, it's like those like...

493
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,300
It's like those sexy firemen calendars.

494
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,540
You did like...

495
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,800
Like sexy Michelin chef...

496
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:36,460
OnlyFans.

497
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,120
Okay.

498
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:40,700
Unironically though...

499
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:44,000
Unironically though, I had to make Michelin star dog food once.

500
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:44,800
Wait, really?

501
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,940
How do you make Michelin star dog food?

502
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:47,940
Yeah.

503
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:48,520
Um, I don't know.

504
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,860
I just like did a brunoise...

505
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:53,300
I just like did a brunoise of like a bunch of vegetables and like beef and stuff.

506
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,200
And then...

507
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,120
Oh my God.

508
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,400
And then just like...

509
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:57,980
Oh my God.

510
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,740
Saltate it and went...

511
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,400
Here it is for your dog, I guess.

512
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,100
Oh my God.

513
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,740
Listen to these microwaves beep.

514
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:03,980
So beautiful.

515
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,400
And then...

516
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:07,820
Remember...

517
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:08,460
So that's...

518
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,540
So I have a disinfectant right here that I use.

519
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:10,660
Yeah.

520
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,720
And that's what I'm gonna use to disinfect it and get everything.

521
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,360
Yep.

522
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,860
This is a quad sanitizer.

523
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,880
So you'll usually find this in a red bucket at restaurants.

524
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:19,340
Yeah.

525
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,080
And it disinfects basically everything.

526
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,020
It's the standard disinfectant that's used.

527
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,860
Can you spray it on food?

528
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:26,920
No.

529
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:27,540
It tastes really bad.

530
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,200
But like...

531
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:30,960
But you...

532
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,620
But it still disinfects it, right?

533
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,620
So if you...

534
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,340
If you drop food...

535
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,140
If you drop food on the floor and then you spray it, will it disinfect the food?

536
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,040
I...

537
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:43,800
Yeah.

538
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:44,320
Technically.

539
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,300
Could you try that out for me?

540
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:54,930
Oh my god.

541
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:55,590
Oh guys.

542
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:58,250
Crazy.

543
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:00,350
He did it.

544
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:01,050
See guys.

545
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:01,590
It works.

546
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:02,910
Don't try this at home.

547
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,970
But if you drop something...

548
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,470
If you drop something really, really good...

549
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,030
You can disinfect...

550
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:13,490
According to Tim and endorsed by Tim, the owner and CEO of Vite Ramen...

551
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:13,610
What?

552
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:13,790
Stop!

553
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:14,510
No!

554
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:15,470
No!

555
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:15,490
No!

556
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:15,930
No!

557
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:15,950
No!

558
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:16,290
No!

559
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:16,790
No!

560
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:17,510
No!

561
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:23,170
I'm spitting it out.

562
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:25,270
I'm spitting it out.

563
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:25,650
Don't...

564
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:26,150
Don't sue me.

565
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:26,570
Don't sue me.

566
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:28,050
All right.

567
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:28,430
Anyway.

568
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:29,890
So what's the next plan?

569
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:32,010
So...

570
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:33,050
I'm just peeling some ginger.

571
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:33,570
Yeah?

572
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:35,550
The fastest way and easiest way to peel ginger by the way is...

573
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:35,970
With a spoon.

574
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:36,690
Uh huh.

575
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:38,930
And we're just gonna...

576
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:39,630
Ah, my god.

577
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:39,910
Okay.

578
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:40,290
You know what?

579
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:40,990
I give up with that one.

580
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,490
I hope you can still hear me.

581
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:44,570
It keeps falling out of my ear.

582
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:45,390
My ear is not made for that.

583
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:48,190
I think one of your ear holes is too big.

584
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:49,450
It's true.

585
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:53,410
You need to have a bigger earbud for that.

586
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:58,190
The problem is... The hole is too big.

587
00:20:59,410 --> 00:20:59,730
Yeah.

588
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:03,190
Sometimes I just jam a lot of stuff in my ear.

589
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:08,490
You know, when you jam the right things into your ear and it just feels really good and you can't stop.

590
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:08,910
Yeah.

591
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:10,190
All right.

592
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:12,690
So what's the next plan for this meal?

593
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:15,370
I'm pretty sure we're behind schedule too.

594
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:16,830
Whoa!

595
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:20,450
I don't know how we got behind schedule, guys.

596
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:24,190
We're not behind schedule.

597
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:26,770
All right.

598
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,970
And then we're just going to... we're going to go with a little yellow wine.

599
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:29,530
Yeah?

600
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,070
We're going to go yellow wine here.

601
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:33,590
Ooh.

602
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,130
And then we're going to go... where'd my soy sauce go?

603
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:37,030
And then I have a little bit of soy sauce.

604
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,830
I'll have to blur that.

605
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,930
Joki, don't stress him.

606
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:42,870
He's used to it.

607
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:44,270
He used to work at a restaurant.

608
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:46,770
I'm his Gordon Ramsay.

609
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:50,430
Guys, where's my MSG?

610
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,430
Guys, where's my MSG?

611
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:55,650
Oh my god, MSG, we can't forget the MSG.

612
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:58,010
How do you not know where it is?

613
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:01,270
Throw it, throw it, throw it, throw it!

614
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:02,350
Whoa!

615
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:04,510
Good!

616
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:09,830
Oh my god, that's a lot of MSG.

617
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:11,790
Oh my god.

618
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,310
No, that's the right amount of MSG.

619
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:15,330
You're right, that's the right amount of it.

620
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:18,270
There's no such thing as not enough.

621
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,150
Or too much.

622
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:23,290
There's no such thing as too much MSG, guys.

623
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,750
All right, that's probably good.

624
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:30,090
That's... yeah.

625
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:30,770
Whoa!

626
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:35,370
So, we got shallots, we got... oh man, I didn't...

627
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:36,450
You forget something?

628
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,030
Yeah, we're just gonna throw some garlic in there real quick.

629
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:40,230
Oh, I love garlic!

630
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:42,610
That's some good-ass chicken.

631
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:44,250
For the, uh...

632
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:45,890
And this is actually the hardest recipe.

633
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,830
The other stuff actually, it goes even faster.

634
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:50,770
Whoa, wait, this is the hardest recipe?

635
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:51,670
Yep.

636
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,050
Wait, what makes it hard?

637
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,790
The fact that I gotta prep so much stuff.

638
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:56,550
Oh!

639
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:58,150
I gotta make my ancestors proud, you know?

640
00:22:58,430 --> 00:22:59,390
Oh, true, true.

641
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:04,730
Like how you ate a shallot off the floor, I bet they're real proud.

642
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:06,710
Yeah, I'm sure they are.

643
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:10,890
Because an anime girl told you to, I bet they're looking down on you right now.

644
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:15,510
Hey, look, look, look.

645
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:19,410
I'm sure my ancestors also would've eaten food off the ground if an anime girl told them to.

646
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:20,410
They just didn't know it.

647
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,370
Great, great crap, are you hearing me?

648
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:24,530
You're right, you're right.

649
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:25,230
He doesn't waste food.

650
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:26,510
I know you were part of the Church of Thydeology.

651
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:27,250
You're...

652
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:27,510
Whoa!

653
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:29,630
Whoa!

654
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:31,170
Whoa!

655
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:33,290
Wait, the guys check my channel, not yours.

656
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:39,750
Guys, if Scientology is watching right now, I...

657
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:40,560
No, Thydeology.

658
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:42,270
Oh, Science...

659
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:42,590
Thy...

660
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:44,830
Thydeology, come on!

661
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:46,530
Oh,醒ology, okay.

662
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:46,970
It's all about theoricis.

663
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:48,090
Oh, yeah, yeah, growingci...

664
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:48,330
Yeah, we're...

665
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:48,430
You know what?

666
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:49,670
Yeah, we're...

667
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:51,550
We're talking about food here, we're talking about, uh...

668
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,770
We're talking how about...

669
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:53,190
The chickens, yeah.

670
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:54,990
We're talking about Thy이지.

671
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:55,430
Fiology, guys.

672
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:56,710
Not the other things.

673
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:57,190
God.

674
00:23:58,670 --> 00:23:59,030
Yeah.

675
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:00,370
You know, like...

676
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:01,810
Thy´好 всем, right, guys?

677
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:02,590
Exactly.

678
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:04,630
Is theology, you guys, nothing else.

679
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:05,670
There's no other ol...

680
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:06,770
Olologies out there.

681
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:09,350
The perfect religion.

682
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:09,490
Yeah, its yeah.

683
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,590
You all gotta read, uh...

684
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,270
You'll all gotta read..

685
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,270
The Holy Thigh-Val?

686
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:15,230
Whoa, what's in it?

687
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:18,190
Who's the god of the Holy Thigh-Val?

688
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:22,210
You know, anyone with a bunch of thighs.

689
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:24,910
Yeah, but there has to be one true thigh.

690
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:27,510
Who's the one true thigh?

691
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,110
So that's where you get into the different denominations.

692
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:34,890
What if you accidentally cut your finger while we're talking about...

693
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:38,430
Then I'm just gonna have one less finger and we're still gonna stream, right?

694
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:40,010
We're still gonna stream.

695
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:45,530
The close-up on your fingers while you try to think of the one true thigh.

696
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:48,890
That's the pressure right there.

697
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:51,350
The show must go on, you're right.

698
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:53,190
You can't put me on the spot like that.

699
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:55,390
Like, there's a lot of good thighs out there.

700
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:57,290
There's a lot of good thighs.

701
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:59,430
Oh, really?

702
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:00,530
What are you...

703
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:04,930
I told you, guys, he's thinking about the thighs too much.

704
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:09,910
Guys, don't... don't handle knives when you're thinking about thighs, Chad.

705
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:11,350
Or things like...

706
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:11,710
No, I disagree.

707
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:12,930
Always think about...

708
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:16,130
When you think about... What, you want to cut a piece of that thigh?

709
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:17,930
Oh my god.

710
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:18,870
Oh my god.

711
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:20,530
It's a professional over there.

712
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:21,650
Look at him go.

713
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:24,490
Holy shit.

714
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:26,970
It's like, look, if you think about thighs, you won't get cut.

715
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:28,770
Oh my god.

716
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:30,170
That's so much pressure.

717
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:35,750
The fucking stress and... stress of watching this.

718
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:37,470
Oh my god.

719
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:39,850
That's what you know he's a professional.

720
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:41,150
Look at that knife go.

721
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:43,730
You can get... you can pre-order this knife right now.

722
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:45,090
Pinned in my cat.

723
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:49,010
I'm so... I'm so glad you're shilling well.

724
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:50,090
I suck at shilling.

725
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:56,790
You can buy that knife right... the Doki Blade right now and pre-order it at Vite Ramen Shop.

726
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:59,810
Pinned... the link is pinned in the description, guys.

727
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:07,950
We're also going to make some... oh, I'm going to do this later because this isn't... this is not a microwave thing.

728
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:12,810
But now, we're also going to make some salmon.

729
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:14,390
Oh my god.

730
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:15,230
I never started this.

731
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:16,010
Oh no.

732
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,910
We're behind schedule, guys.

733
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:19,730
What are you going to do?

734
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:21,190
It's fine.

735
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:21,750
Don't worry about it.

736
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:22,710
I'm worrying.

737
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:23,250
We don't do the wrong.

738
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:25,910
Guys, let's worry too and put more stress on him.

739
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:30,910
Let's remind him what it was like in that Michelin star restaurant chat.

740
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:34,150
Give me another chance.

741
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:35,210
Yes, Chef.

742
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:35,930
Yes, Chef.

743
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:38,230
Yes, Chef Doki.

744
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:38,870
Yes, Chef Doki.

745
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:39,850
Okay.

746
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:40,410
I got it.

747
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:42,270
Five minutes on salmon, Chef.

748
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:43,070
Five minutes on salmon.

749
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:44,150
We're just going to... yeah.

750
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:45,550
Oh my god.

751
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:46,590
You have the three over here.

752
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:47,070
That's it.

753
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:47,710
Right?

754
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:47,710
Okay.

755
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:50,630
And then... hey, you want the salmon on the Western style?

756
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:53,530
You want Western style or you want Eastern?

757
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:55,210
Oh, that's hard.

758
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:56,210
Can we do half-half?

759
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:57,810
Yeah, we'll do half-half.

760
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:58,470
Yeah.

761
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:00,050
We're going to do this on one half.

762
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:02,950
We're going to go MSG on everything.

763
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:04,010
Oh my god.

764
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:05,950
That's a lot of MSG.

765
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:08,670
And we're going to go yellow wine on one side.

766
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:12,610
And then the middle side is just going to be like the mix of everything, you know?

767
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:13,190
Yeah.

768
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:16,190
Oh, so it's like fusion.

769
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:17,490
Oh, it's a fusion!

770
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:19,050
Yeah.

771
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:20,090
And then we have tomato?

772
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:21,430
Whoa!

773
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:24,530
Look how sharp that is, guys.

774
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:25,890
Oh my...

775
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:26,710
He's missing.

776
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:28,610
Use your iron sight, Tim.

777
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:29,990
Use the iron sight.

778
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:30,990
That's the whole thing.

779
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:31,550
You're right.

780
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:32,170
You're right.

781
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:34,670
I hit it.

782
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:37,610
I keep hitting it.

783
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:38,890
I'm just saying.

784
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:39,190
All right.

785
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:42,070
Buying a Doki blade does not make you aim better, Chad.

786
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:42,610
I'm sorry.

787
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,850
I think Tim has proven that for us.

788
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:50,310
Doki, you're supposed to tell them and do some aimbot!

789
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:54,990
Well, how am I supposed to lie if you don't upheld...

790
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:56,990
If you don't help me, lie with me!

791
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:00,830
I can't lie if you can't...

792
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:03,770
If you can't prove my lie correctly!

793
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:05,530
We'll edit the...

794
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:06,030
We'll edit the...

795
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,550
We'll edit...

796
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:07,970
We'll edit in post!

797
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:08,730
We'll edit in post!

798
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,970
Yeah, we'll edit this...

799
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:13,430
We'll edit this livestream in post, guys.

800
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:15,750
Yeah.

801
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:16,270
Yeah, okay.

802
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:16,870
Oh, you're right.

803
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:19,590
Increases accuracy, but does not improve aim.

804
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:20,430
You're so right.

805
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:23,510
Tim's aim was actually much worse than that, guys.

806
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:26,730
His accuracy increased because of the knife.

807
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:32,250
So, if you thought that that was bad, imagine what he was like before he used the Doki blade.

808
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:34,450
Like...

809
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:36,550
Can your knife do this?

810
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:38,630
Yeah, can your knife do this?

811
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:39,090
Whoa!

812
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,330
Can your knife do that?

813
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:40,850
Whoa!

814
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:41,650
Look at that!

815
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:45,330
Before he used the Doki blade, he missed all those shots.

816
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:47,010
True, true, true, true.

817
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:50,940
Look at that.

818
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:51,560
Whoa!

819
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,620
That's some good-ass cutting right there.

820
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,100
Um...

821
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,600
I don't know what I was going to do with this.

822
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,500
What was I going to do with this?

823
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,580
You're going to make a fusion.

824
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,320
Yeah, okay.

825
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:02,340
Okay.

826
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,600
We're going to put this on one side.

827
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:04,500
Yeah.

828
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,640
That's fine.

829
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:06,700
That's fine.

830
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,080
It'll taste good.

831
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:08,420
Wait.

832
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,100
What do you mean?

833
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,840
I thought you were confident.

834
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,280
I thought you were a Michelin chef.

835
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,080
Wouldn't everything you cook be good?

836
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:16,220
Yeah.

837
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,140
I improvised everything.

838
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,180
Oh!

839
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,300
That's so true.

840
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,080
That's so true.

841
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:22,480
Yeah, look at that.

842
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,440
We're going to also go with some garlic over here.

843
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:27,580
You just got to go garlic, shallots, ginger.

844
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,220
Not just go through everything, right?

845
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,120
You should add more MSG on top of all of that.

846
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:31,440
Oh, yeah?

847
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,380
Yeah, yeah.

848
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,060
You should.

849
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:34,600
Ooh.

850
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:36,620
Ooh.

851
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:38,520
That's...

852
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,080
That's his white powder, guys.

853
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,400
That's...

854
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,640
Dude, this one's gonna...

855
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,100
This one's gonna break by the time this is over.

856
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:46,780
Yeah.

857
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:51,840
Right?

858
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:52,520
Yeah.

859
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:53,680
We're just gonna throw some...

860
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,580
We're just gonna throw the...

861
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,320
Some garlic in there.

862
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,200
Just a quick peel.

863
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,640
Nice, simple.

864
00:29:59,460 --> 00:29:59,980
Simplastic!

865
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:01,500
Okay.

866
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,280
And then that's it.

867
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:02,800
And then...

868
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,020
And then it's microwave time.

869
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:09,760
And this will give you perfect tender salmon every single time.

870
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:10,900
The towel!

871
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:11,000
Yup.

872
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,400
It's the towel trick!

873
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:12,820
Slap it in.

874
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,400
Microwave time!

875
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,040
Yippee!

876
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,040
And this...

877
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,260
Uh, we'll go for six minutes and then we'll check it.

878
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,400
Six minutes?

879
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,460
In the microwave?

880
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:24,620
Yup.

881
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:25,680
And that's pretty much all you need.

882
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,720
If we just had one, it would be even faster.

883
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:28,740
Ooh!

884
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:29,900
I didn't put the ginger in.

885
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,160
You know what?

886
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:30,460
That's fine.

887
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:30,940
Don't worry about it.

888
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:31,620
It's fine.

889
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:32,340
It's fine.

890
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,140
Ginger doesn't even taste that good.

891
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:35,460
Whoa!

892
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:36,380
Whoa!

893
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:37,300
Whoa!

894
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,180
I thought...

895
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,960
They don't have soles anyway.

896
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,360
It doesn't matter.

897
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:42,440
Oh!

898
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,660
Wait!

899
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:44,200
Wait!

900
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:44,640
Wait!

901
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,100
Hang on!

902
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,180
Hang on!

903
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,240
So true, right chat?

904
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,480
So true!

905
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:56,780
All right.

906
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,100
What...

907
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,460
So, what we're actually going to do with some of these...

908
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:03,440
So, we are going to use a technique called Konkase as well.

909
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:03,920
Yeah?

910
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,900
We're also going to do...

911
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,520
What was that?

912
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,340
We're going to go ahead and...

913
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,140
Well, actually, no.

914
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:11,180
I'm going to go ahead and first make our...

915
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,360
Um...

916
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,340
We're going to make our, uh...

917
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:15,860
Tomato rice.

918
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,440
Oh my god!

919
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,080
We can...

920
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,080
Guys, he's going to show us how to microwave a rice!

921
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,240
You'll never have to buy a rice cooker again!

922
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,500
So, we lightly score.

923
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:27,880
Yeah?

924
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,940
We lightly score over here, which you can't do if you have a shitty knife.

925
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,740
You're going to just stick it right on top.

926
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,500
You don't need a tomato to be...

927
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:36,500
To be clear.

928
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:36,980
But it'll taste better.

929
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,480
You do not need a tomato to do that.

930
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:38,700
Yeah.

931
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:39,880
But it'll taste better.

932
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:40,880
Because tomatoes have a lot of umami.

933
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:41,700
Oh!

934
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,580
What does that mean?

935
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,060
What does umami mean?

936
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:46,160
Umami is savory flavor.

937
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:47,160
Uh-huh.

938
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:47,520
It is...

939
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,860
It is the stuff that makes your brain go...

940
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:50,960
Mmm.

941
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,240
When you taste something.

942
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:52,700
Oh!

943
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:53,880
And, uh...

944
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:55,560
So...

945
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,840
Tomatoes have a lot of it.

946
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,320
That's why we're putting it in pretty much everything.

947
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:58,760
Oh!

948
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,820
This, uh, right here...

949
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:00,840
We scored on the top.

950
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
And we're going to microwave it.

951
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,980
So that it will, uh, split apart.

952
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,680
And then we're going to peel it and get the skin out.

953
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,520
So that...

954
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,340
We have a skin.

955
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,040
Just like this tomato skin I'm currently wearing.

956
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:10,520
Oh!

957
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,760
That's so cool, guys.

958
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:14,640
Are you taking notes?

959
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:18,600
Wait, why was there water in that other microwave?

960
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,460
Um, because you can't run a microwave dry.

961
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,200
Otherwise, it will burn.

962
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:23,440
Oh!

963
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:24,900
Yep.

964
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,260
So what happened?

965
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:31,980
So if you just had nothing in that microwave, and you just press it, it'll, like, explode?

966
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:33,740
It...

967
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:34,020
Yes.

968
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:34,900
It will...

969
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,080
It will, uh...

970
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:36,780
How do you know that?

971
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,040
Have you tried it before?

972
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,200
Have you tried it before?

973
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,540
Um, yes!

974
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:42,780
Actually, when I was doing my industrial microwave, I nearly died two times.

975
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:43,960
Whoa!

976
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:45,840
You lived?

977
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:45,880
Right?

978
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:46,660
Isn't that cool?

979
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:47,920
How did you live?

980
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,220
Yeah, I nearly got electrocuted and died.

981
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,080
Wait, what?

982
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:50,760
A skill issue.

983
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:51,860
A skill.

984
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:52,740
Wait, how?

985
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:53,020
Wait, wait.

986
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,700
Okay, there's a lot to unpack there.

987
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,020
So, um...

988
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,960
So, like, what did you do?

989
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,100
I was building...

990
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,160
I was building the micro...

991
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:02,800
Industrial microwave.

992
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,840
We needed to test voltages.

993
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,140
And it...

994
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:05,340
It...

995
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:08,680
And my dad was like, oh, yeah, no, you should just, like, put the wire over there.

996
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,000
I'm like, dad, there's, like, 200 amps running through that right now.

997
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,700
And he's like, it's okay, I'll just hold this aside with a screwdriver.

998
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:14,380
And I'm like...

999
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,640
Wait, your dad endorses this?

1000
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:16,880
You're...

1001
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,340
He doesn't like to talk about it.

1002
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:18,800
Your dad...

1003
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:20,260
You're...

1004
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:32,740
You're...

1005
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,020
Yeah.

1006
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:37,120
Yeah, just a little family project of, you know, nearly electrocuting and dying.

1007
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:37,920
Don't worry about it.

1008
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:38,320
It's fine.

1009
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,060
Okay, so what happened after that?

1010
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:45,300
So, uh, what happened after that was, uh, I...

1011
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,280
Oh my god, I didn't start this.

1012
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,660
I need to remember to start things.

1013
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,880
What happened after that was, um, it actually shocked...

1014
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,460
This was during...

1015
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,480
This was during production.

1016
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:56,880
So, while...

1017
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,560
While we were making noodles, we were testing the microwave because it was a new build.

1018
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,240
Yeah.

1019
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:01,880
And then, uh...

1020
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:02,930
And then...

1021
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:05,820
He put...

1022
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:06,660
He pushed it aside.

1023
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:10,260
And then I tried to put a little bit of things in there.

1024
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,080
Uh-huh.

1025
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:13,660
Uh...

1026
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,560
And then his screwdriver slipped.

1027
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,100
It slipped and then all the...

1028
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,740
All the wires came together all at once.

1029
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,000
And there was a flashbang.

1030
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,220
And then suddenly, I couldn't see.

1031
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,100
I couldn't hear.

1032
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,140
I couldn't feel anything.

1033
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:28,160
And I was sitting there going, Am I dead?

1034
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,020
Is this what death is like?

1035
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,100
What a way to go.

1036
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,580
And then my ears started ringing.

1037
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,840
And then my eyes started to get back.

1038
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:38,900
And then my dad is sitting there shocked going...

1039
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,200
Oh my god.

1040
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,160
And then my entire production crew is sitting there going...

1041
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,160
Because it was a loud bang and flash.

1042
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:44,560
Yeah.

1043
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,900
And they're all looking going...

1044
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,020
Oh my god.

1045
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:47,960
Is he dead?

1046
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,420
And I'm just sitting there going...

1047
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:53,920
Hey, Dad, why don't we not measure this?

1048
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,760
And he was like, nah, okay.

1049
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:02,100
Yeah, that's like, someone was like, that's basically a small lightning strike at point blank.

1050
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:03,220
Yup.

1051
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:06,680
Wait, did you get... did you see a doctor after?

1052
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,540
Absolutely not.

1053
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,360
Yeah, I was gonna say, you're American, right?

1054
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:13,300
Whoa!

1055
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,220
Whoa!

1056
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,920
What's that supposed to mean?

1057
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,280
But you're actually right!

1058
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,220
Oh my God!

1059
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,260
Wow!

1060
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,060
Rude!

1061
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,560
Rude, but true!

1062
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,500
Rude, but true!

1063
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,560
Alright, now we're gonna start making the clam chowder.

1064
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,140
I'm gonna go ahead and peel potatoes for that.

1065
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:31,760
What?

1066
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:32,520
What?

1067
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,080
Health medical calls are expensive!

1068
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,460
They're expensive over there!

1069
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:43,760
It's like, it's like, like, four digits for a fucking ambulance, guys!

1070
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,700
For you non-Americans out there!

1071
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,180
What do you mean, four?

1072
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,320
Wait, is it five digits?

1073
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:47,700
Last time.

1074
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,440
Right?

1075
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:48,680
Yeah!

1076
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,040
Ten thousand dollars!

1077
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:50,940
Oh my God!

1078
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,620
Ten thousand dollars for an ambulance ride sometimes!

1079
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,800
Five digits, guys!

1080
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:57,620
To get an ambulance ride for you non-Americans out there!

1081
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:00,680
My comment is true!

1082
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,900
They booed her because she was right!

1083
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,600
Okay, so what are you doing right now?

1084
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:08,640
Yeah!

1085
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:12,460
So, I'm making, uh, I'm gonna make some clam chowder with a microwave.

1086
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:12,960
Mm-hmm!

1087
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:15,940
And so, I'm just, uh, I'm just cutting the, uh, the potatoes.

1088
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,980
We're just gonna do a nice cube.

1089
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:20,820
Whoa!

1090
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,980
And, uh, after we do a nice cube, then we're just gonna...

1091
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,120
Oh God, do I have another big container?

1092
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:30,980
Ah, we'll figure it out.

1093
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,020
Wait, are you gonna bring another container?

1094
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:39,120
What happens if you just put it in without a container?

1095
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,100
Would it still...

1096
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:41,340
Um...

1097
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,220
You just put it with paper towel.

1098
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,620
Yeah, but it'd get all over the microwave plate.

1099
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,380
Yeah, I, I...

1100
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:47,200
I mean, you have ten microwaves, does it really matter?

1101
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,040
I do!

1102
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,180
I do have ten microwaves!

1103
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:55,280
Does it really matter if one microwave gets dirty when you have ten microwaves?

1104
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,360
I bet...

1105
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,420
Yeah, see?

1106
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,700
Wait, actually, wait, actually, here, I can just put it in the water.

1107
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:01,940
Actually, that would make more sense.

1108
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,100
Oh.

1109
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,560
Wow, look at us, using our brain cells.

1110
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,760
I know, right?

1111
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,660
Our singular brain cells together.

1112
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:10,100
Hey, Donkey, can I borrow the brain cell today?

1113
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,460
No, we're gonna have to share this.

1114
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:13,600
Donkey, can I borrow the brain cell today?

1115
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:13,780
Dammit!

1116
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:17,220
We're gonna have to share this and want to get through today's stream.

1117
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:18,680
Man!

1118
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:22,740
Mom always says that you get to use the brain cell!

1119
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,700
I wanna use it!

1120
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,760
Cause mom's right.

1121
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,240
There's a reason why.

1122
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:29,860
Whoa!

1123
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,300
What is that supposed to mean?

1124
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,340
What is that supposed to mean?

1125
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,080
So we're gonna cook that.

1126
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,540
And then, uh...

1127
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,780
Oh my god, do I have my mía pois?

1128
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:40,780
Yeah.

1129
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,100
And we also have our celery, right?

1130
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:42,480
Ooh!

1131
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,400
Oh my god, look at him go!

1132
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,200
And, uh, that's...

1133
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:48,860
So that's how you...

1134
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:50,720
Yeah?

1135
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,020
Sorry, my face is covering me.

1136
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,360
That's how you cut celery in a Michelin star restaurant, you know?

1137
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:54,760
Yeah.

1138
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:55,160
Perfect.

1139
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:57,020
You know, that's perfect right there.

1140
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:57,620
Wait.

1141
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:58,600
And then you gather it all up.

1142
00:37:58,900 --> 00:37:59,320
Yeah.

1143
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:00,420
Wait, but like...

1144
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,200
Yeah, so that...

1145
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,960
Yeah, this is how you do it.

1146
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:03,320
Really?

1147
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,900
And then the next step...

1148
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:05,000
Yep.

1149
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,480
Never order celery, guys.

1150
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,980
Oh my god, I'm so sorry, chef!

1151
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:08,400
Chef!

1152
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:08,780
Chef!

1153
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,360
Chef, don't tell me!

1154
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,140
Chef, please!

1155
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:10,920
Chef, please!

1156
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:11,660
Oh my god!

1157
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,660
No, it's like...

1158
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:12,920
Don't worry about it!

1159
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,280
Guys, never order celery.

1160
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:16,080
Again.

1161
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:20,080
Right?

1162
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,880
And then, uh...

1163
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,200
And then, uh...

1164
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,560
Oh, we're not gonna show that one off yet.

1165
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,060
That's...

1166
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,100
That's not there yet.

1167
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,020
Uh...

1168
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,080
Yeah, and then we'll...

1169
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:29,760
Go ahead and put this.

1170
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:30,980
We don't need that much.

1171
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:32,220
Um...

1172
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,560
Where'd I put my onions?

1173
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,400
Hey guys, did I put the onions over there?

1174
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,340
Where did he put the onions, guys?

1175
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:39,140
Staff team!

1176
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:40,440
Onions!

1177
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,140
Where's his onion staff?

1178
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:42,320
It's fine.

1179
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:43,140
We're gonna use shallots.

1180
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:43,820
Okay.

1181
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:44,560
We're gonna use shallots.

1182
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,480
Alright, we don't need this much celery.

1183
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:49,500
In fact, too much celery is just gonna not taste that good.

1184
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,940
Yeah, I was gonna say, that's a lot of fucking celery.

1185
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:53,520
That's...

1186
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,120
Guys, eat your veggies!

1187
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,160
I'll use that later in a beer plow or something.

1188
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,220
Eat your veggies, guys!

1189
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:02,220
So, we're gonna go ahead and just put this with...

1190
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:03,900
Um...

1191
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:04,280
Oh, wait.

1192
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:04,840
No, actually.

1193
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:06,580
Uh...

1194
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:06,840
So, yeah.

1195
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:07,560
We're gonna use this.

1196
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,920
We're gonna use shallots.

1197
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,860
So, there's gonna be a pseudo-mirepoix, which is usually, uh, onion, carrot, tomato.

1198
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:14,740
Uh-huh.

1199
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:15,460
Or...

1200
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,220
It's gonna be...

1201
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:26,380
Whoa, you got so stressed out to start speaking Chinese, guys.

1202
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,140
He...

1203
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:27,660
No!

1204
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:30,180
You got...

1205
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:34,340
Bro, guys, he forgot how to speak English from distress, guys.

1206
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,360
I'm sorry.

1207
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:36,880
I'm sorry.

1208
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:37,040
I'm sorry!

1209
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:37,240
I'm sorry!

1210
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:37,480
I'm sorry!

1211
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:37,880
I'm sorry!

1212
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:40,760
I'm sorry!

1213
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,500
He's getting PTSD, guys.

1214
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,240
So, we're gonna put the shallots in there as well?

1215
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,720
And then we're gonna put some cream?

1216
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:47,640
Where the...

1217
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:47,900
Okay.

1218
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,060
Then we're gonna put some cream?

1219
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,860
Uh, I am lactose intolerant, but I'm doing this for you guys, alright?

1220
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:53,540
Sweet.

1221
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:55,720
I'm not.

1222
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:57,460
What?

1223
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:02,240
I'm the 1% Asian that's not lactose intolerant.

1224
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:02,960
Oh my god, I can't believe this.

1225
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,000
This is bullshit.

1226
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:08,900
I won the genetic lottery, guys.

1227
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,920
I need as much cheese and peas I want.

1228
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,420
Okay, that's not ready yet.

1229
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:15,900
Almost there.

1230
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,700
Keep that one going.

1231
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,200
This one.

1232
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:19,960
Yep.

1233
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:21,160
We'll keep that going.

1234
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,760
And then, this one.

1235
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:26,600
I think it's actually done.

1236
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:27,880
Ow, that's hot.

1237
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,180
Watch me burn myself.

1238
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:32,760
So, a little bit of suffering, right?

1239
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:33,940
Which one was this one?

1240
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,060
Oh, that's the salmon.

1241
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,040
That's the six-minute salmon.

1242
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:42,620
Salmon!

1243
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,020
Oh, is it good?

1244
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,460
Yeah, and you can see, this is perfectly cooked.

1245
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,340
Wait, I want a close-up of that.

1246
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,680
Cameraman, give me a close-up.

1247
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,300
Close-up.

1248
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,320
Cameraman, I want to see.

1249
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:59,340
Oh, wait, that actually looks good.

1250
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:00,000
Yeah?

1251
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:00,720
Wait.

1252
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:03,140
That looks good.

1253
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,920
Let's get a cross-section.

1254
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:08,940
Oh my god, yeah.

1255
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,300
This is a microwave salmon, guys.

1256
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,980
Wait, you have a knife.

1257
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:13,680
Just cut it.

1258
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,460
So, we're going to do another little trick.

1259
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:18,940
Yeah?

1260
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,560
This special thing will let us sear and get a crispy bottom of the salmon.

1261
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,300
So, we're just going to put this into the microwave.

1262
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:27,740
Yeah?

1263
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:30,660
We're actually going to microwave it for three minutes by itself.

1264
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,800
And that will get it really, really hot.

1265
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:33,880
Oh.

1266
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:38,760
And then, let me get, like, a spoon or something.

1267
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:41,700
And we're just going to lift this out.

1268
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:42,220
Yeah?

1269
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:46,620
Without the strength.

1270
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:47,620
Oh my god, it's so tender.

1271
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,240
Oh my god, it's falling apart.

1272
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:50,920
Look at that.

1273
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,940
That's a tender-ass salmon.

1274
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,720
Yeah, you see that?

1275
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,240
Yeah.

1276
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:55,720
See that?

1277
00:41:56,120 --> 00:42:00,300
We'll get this one on camera so you can see exactly.

1278
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:01,180
Ooh.

1279
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:04,700
Oh, you got, like, a big thing in front, by the way, Terrence.

1280
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,660
You got, like, the files for some reason.

1281
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:07,740
The files?

1282
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,040
All right.

1283
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,000
And then...

1284
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,420
Yeah, Terrence, get that shit out of here.

1285
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:13,200
Ooh.

1286
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,420
You see that?

1287
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,680
You'll see how flicky that is?

1288
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,000
Yeah.

1289
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:17,460
You can see how tender that is?

1290
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:17,780
Ooh.

1291
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,400
That looks good.

1292
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:19,820
Tender.

1293
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:20,920
Moist.

1294
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:21,720
Juicy.

1295
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:22,240
Eat it.

1296
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,340
Ow, it's burning my fingers.

1297
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:24,700
Eat it right now.

1298
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:26,860
Is it good?

1299
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:27,820
Oh, shit, that's really fucking good.

1300
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:28,360
Holy fuck.

1301
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,300
Oh, wait, really?

1302
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,800
Holy shit.

1303
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:32,300
Oh, you guys want to know this?

1304
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,980
Get a guy off the street and tell us the truth.

1305
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,440
Oh, is that Terrence?

1306
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:40,900
Yeah, of course.

1307
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:42,280
Terrence, try it.

1308
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:42,980
No, this is Leo.

1309
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:43,700
This is Leo.

1310
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,760
Wow, what a flavor.

1311
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:49,920
Yeah.

1312
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:52,140
We doxed Leo.

1313
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:52,980
Let's go.

1314
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:54,140
I need another one.

1315
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,340
That was really good.

1316
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:02,080
Yeah, wait, I said put more MSG on it.

1317
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:03,900
Yeah, that was all me, guys.

1318
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,920
I said we got to put more MSG.

1319
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,080
Let's go.

1320
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,020
All right, and then we're going to...

1321
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:20,840
Oh, and then what we're going to do in order to give our lobster a little bit of flavor.

1322
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:21,420
Oh, it's the lobster.

1323
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:22,640
Lobster, yeah.

1324
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:27,340
We're actually going to go ahead and pour the juices of this into here.

1325
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,200
Just a little bit.

1326
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:29,780
Yeah.

1327
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:31,340
And then water.

1328
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,260
And then, importantly, we want tomato.

1329
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:36,400
Yeah.

1330
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:37,240
This is...

1331
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:40,140
We're going to go tomato, and we're going to go wine.

1332
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:42,540
We're going to go white wine over here.

1333
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:45,280
And this is going to be kind of like...

1334
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,400
Why is it in a black box?

1335
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,160
Because I can't afford good wine, okay?

1336
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:52,840
I'm just a tomato.

1337
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:54,120
All right?

1338
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:59,740
Say he's a guy with fucking 11 microwaves, guys.

1339
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:00,780
He can't.

1340
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:08,620
Tim, I think maybe if instead of buying, you know, 11 microwaves, maybe you could afford better wine.

1341
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:09,640
You know?

1342
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,920
The microwaves are my life.

1343
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:16,160
Look how beautiful they are.

1344
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:17,800
They're so nice.

1345
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:20,460
It all goes into the microwaves.

1346
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:23,780
Oh, my God.

1347
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:24,460
Look how sharp.

1348
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:25,460
We don't need that tomato.

1349
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,320
He's a problem, child.

1350
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:30,040
Just like me.

1351
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,120
For real, for real.

1352
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:33,860
And, of course, MSG.

1353
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,920
Anything savory, we always want to go MSG.

1354
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,300
I do have time.

1355
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:38,300
I'm not going to put time out of it.

1356
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,300
We're running out of time, guys.

1357
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:40,220
We're running out of time.

1358
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:40,840
It's all right.

1359
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:42,760
We could go a little over time.

1360
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:44,460
We could go.

1361
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:46,220
We've got to make sure that everything's cooked.

1362
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:46,760
No, I mean time.

1363
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:49,100
That's in T-H-Y-M-E.

1364
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:51,740
See, that's...

1365
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:52,040
Time!

1366
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:55,480
You've got to be a chef to understand that joke.

1367
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:56,120
Yeah.

1368
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:58,400
I am going to put it in.

1369
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,880
That's a joke for all you chef goons out there.

1370
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:02,740
Did you enjoy that joke, guys?

1371
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:07,160
We've got to do something for everybody.

1372
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:11,140
Oh, I need some garlic in there.

1373
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,100
Actually, I don't.

1374
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:12,480
I don't care.

1375
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,080
I don't care enough.

1376
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:13,900
Boom.

1377
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,300
Like, garlic's good.

1378
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:16,040
I care.

1379
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:16,720
We're going to cook three lobsters.

1380
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:17,660
Okay.

1381
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:18,200
Okay, okay.

1382
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:18,980
I care.

1383
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:20,200
Yes, chef.

1384
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:20,520
Yes, chef.

1385
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:21,000
I'm sorry, chef.

1386
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,060
I'm sorry for trying to take sure.

1387
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:26,740
I'm sorry, chef.

1388
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:27,840
Sorry, chef.

1389
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:28,240
Sorry, chef.

1390
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:28,800
What happened, chef?

1391
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:29,340
You care?

1392
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,580
Guys, he doesn't care about you, but I do.

1393
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,580
I knew you guys cared about the garlic.

1394
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:38,740
What's that?

1395
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:40,660
What's wrong with the microwaves?

1396
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:41,380
There's so many.

1397
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,880
Oh, that's the chicken.

1398
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:48,760
That's the tomato rice?

1399
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:49,800
This is the chicken?

1400
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:50,320
Yeah.

1401
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:53,660
We're going to need another container, and we're going to make our chicken rice chicken.

1402
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,700
Oh, chicken rice chicken.

1403
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,180
Hello, chicken.

1404
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,620
It booms the man garlic.

1405
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,200
What's that?

1406
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:03,000
Oh, is that the rice?

1407
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:03,560
Guys, guys, no.

1408
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:04,240
I'm doing it.

1409
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,980
Guys, this is the most important part of this entire stream.

1410
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:09,600
Just this part.

1411
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:12,660
Oh, my God.

1412
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:13,900
That smells totally...

1413
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:14,400
Oh, my God.

1414
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,040
Wait, no.

1415
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:15,280
We're streaming.

1416
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:15,480
Okay.

1417
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:17,060
Dude, you guys got to smell this later.

1418
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,360
I'm so sorry that you can't.

1419
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,100
Guys, he broke out of character.

1420
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,780
That's how good it was.

1421
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:25,360
He broke out of character.

1422
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:29,740
That's his CEO voice right there.

1423
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:30,000
That's so good.

1424
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:30,920
Jesus.

1425
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:31,840
Okay.

1426
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:36,140
This, we just got put in the microwave for...

1427
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:37,220
Okay, this one still needs to go.

1428
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:38,740
Which microwave?

1429
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:40,040
Is this one done?

1430
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:40,800
That's not done.

1431
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:41,720
That needs some more time.

1432
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:42,400
What about this one?

1433
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:42,880
This one's clear.

1434
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:43,260
Okay.

1435
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:43,820
This one.

1436
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:44,140
Go.

1437
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:47,760
So, this one, we're going to go 12 minutes.

1438
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:48,120
Wait.

1439
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:49,120
So, okay.

1440
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:49,460
Wait, wait.

1441
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,280
How do we do this to make...

1442
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:56,520
So, we put rice in a bowl and then microwave it for 12 minutes and then we get rice?

1443
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:57,780
Yep.

1444
00:46:58,020 --> 00:46:58,280
Two to one.

1445
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:01,440
So, you want to do two to one ratio or you can use the old Asian trick.

1446
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:02,880
The old Asian trick.

1447
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,700
Oh, let me just show that again with a little bit.

1448
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:06,480
Yeah, yeah.

1449
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,300
I need a...

1450
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:09,660
Okay.

1451
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:11,740
So, guys, take notes, guys.

1452
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:13,280
So, you'll never eat a rice cooker.

1453
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:13,600
Yeah.

1454
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:13,860
Right?

1455
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:15,540
Any amount of rice here.

1456
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:16,260
Yeah.

1457
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:16,760
Right?

1458
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:22,420
And what we do is you just add enough water.

1459
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:27,440
Well, this is a small amount of rice, but to go up to that first knuckle over here.

1460
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,520
Oh, guys, are you taking notes?

1461
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:30,640
Right?

1462
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:31,740
So, you just...

1463
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:31,840
Yeah.

1464
00:47:35,490 --> 00:47:43,950
Sometimes, though, if your hands are like mine and it's a little too big, then you want to go a little under the first knuckle if you have big hands.

1465
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:48,370
But otherwise, usually up to the first knuckle, that's the correct amount of rice.

1466
00:47:48,530 --> 00:47:49,610
And make sure you wash your rice!

1467
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:51,970
I don't know which camera's active right now.

1468
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:53,230
Make sure you wash your rice.

1469
00:47:54,090 --> 00:47:58,510
Guys, and then you put that in the microwave so you never need to buy a rice cooker again.

1470
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:00,430
Oh, that needs to go a little bit more.

1471
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:00,970
Okay.

1472
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:03,850
And then we're hitting our garlic.

1473
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:05,490
Yeah.

1474
00:48:05,870 --> 00:48:11,670
And then we're hitting our garlic so that Chef Toki doesn't yell at me.

1475
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:12,550
That's right.

1476
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:14,370
That's right.

1477
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:18,850
I'm here to give you PTSD of your great time in the Michelin star restaurant.

1478
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:24,650
All right, look at it go.

1479
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:29,170
You should be honored to be yelled at.

1480
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:36,190
I'm sure people would pay for the privilege, people would pay for the privilege, Chef!

1481
00:48:36,310 --> 00:48:37,870
Oh my God, I'm actually out of microwaves.

1482
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:39,490
Oh wait, here, this is perfect.

1483
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:41,950
I was going to say, how are you out of microwaves?

1484
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:42,170
Boom.

1485
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:45,650
I'm out of microwaves!

1486
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:51,130
All right, so this one, it's super super hot, and watch, watch what we do now.

1487
00:48:51,810 --> 00:48:55,190
So this one has the skin, okay, the skin's falling off a little bit, don't worry about it.

1488
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:58,270
But, do you hear that?

1489
00:48:58,610 --> 00:48:58,910
Yeah.

1490
00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:00,830
Oh, the sear!

1491
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:01,250
Yeah!

1492
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:01,650
It's sizzling!

1493
00:49:02,450 --> 00:49:02,810
Yeah!

1494
00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:03,270
Yeah!

1495
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:12,790
And so, and so what we can do here is, this is a microwave plate, it sears it, and so we want to start it again, and then we'll microwave.

1496
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:15,990
That one's probably going to be a little bit overcooked because I forgot to take it out a little early.

1497
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:16,950
But you know, that's fine.

1498
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:18,530
You guys can't tell on camera.

1499
00:49:19,010 --> 00:49:21,150
Yeah, but we heard the sizzle.

1500
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:22,410
We heard it.

1501
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:22,850
Yeah!

1502
00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:25,690
Look at this.

1503
00:49:25,890 --> 00:49:26,330
Oh!

1504
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:26,970
Look at that.

1505
00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:27,850
Oh!

1506
00:49:28,350 --> 00:49:29,350
That looks good.

1507
00:49:30,850 --> 00:49:31,270
Oh.

1508
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:32,190
What is this for?

1509
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:32,970
Ah!

1510
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:34,530
Ha ha ha!

1511
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:35,870
Oh, it's hot.

1512
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:37,930
So what is this chicken for?

1513
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:39,450
Yeah.

1514
00:49:39,530 --> 00:49:41,050
This is for the Ahayonee chicken rice.

1515
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:41,990
Oh!

1516
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:44,530
And we're going to do a, we're going to do a flash infusion.

1517
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:45,170
Okay, you know what?

1518
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:46,990
That's, that's too, we're going to put this aside for now.

1519
00:49:47,130 --> 00:49:48,050
Because I'm burning my fingers.

1520
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:48,330
Ow!

1521
00:49:49,330 --> 00:49:51,850
And so we are going to do a flash infusion.

1522
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:53,670
What does that mean?

1523
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:58,410
Okay, so, so normally, you know you get the sauces in Ahayonee chicken rice, right?

1524
00:49:58,710 --> 00:49:58,750
Yeah.

1525
00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:03,230
Normally, that would take quite a while in order to do.

1526
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:10,770
But here, we're going to make a garlic, we're going to make a garlic, garlic and scallion infusion in just three minutes.

1527
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:12,430
Whoa, three minutes?

1528
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:13,750
Yep.

1529
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:15,410
How long does it usually take?

1530
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:16,270
So...

1531
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:17,670
Like 30 to 40 minutes.

1532
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:18,610
Whoa!

1533
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:20,790
Wait, how are you doing that?

1534
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:22,490
How are you making it three minutes?

1535
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:34,790
So, microwaves, microwaves, I talked about it earlier, but microwaves don't actually heat up, microwaves only do polar things, which is, which means that it will only heat up water-based things.

1536
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:36,690
It does not heat up oil-based things.

1537
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:41,870
Wait, so why don't people cook with microwaves instead of like the fucking boring way?

1538
00:50:42,850 --> 00:50:44,270
That's what I'm saying!

1539
00:50:44,690 --> 00:50:45,210
The long boring way.

1540
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:45,650
The long boring way.

1541
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:46,810
This is like actual...

1542
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:48,650
This is more speedrunning, guys.

1543
00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:50,470
We're speedrunning cooking right now.

1544
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:53,090
Look at how many things I'm able to make right now.

1545
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:54,730
Wait, can we be on speedrun.com?

1546
00:50:54,730 --> 00:50:56,870
I know there's a speedrun for making cookies.

1547
00:50:56,870 --> 00:50:57,930
Can we...

1548
00:50:57,930 --> 00:50:58,350
Yeah.

1549
00:50:58,350 --> 00:50:59,550
Can we register?

1550
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:00,790
No, unironically.

1551
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:01,450
Unironically.

1552
00:51:01,590 --> 00:51:03,630
I think if you used a microwave, it would go faster.

1553
00:51:04,090 --> 00:51:06,510
Guys, did you guys know there's a speedrun for cookies?

1554
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:07,670
For making cookies?

1555
00:51:08,050 --> 00:51:09,970
Nearly on speedrun.com?

1556
00:51:10,050 --> 00:51:12,930
Oh my God, we can register this on Cooking Any Percent.

1557
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:14,730
Any percent?

1558
00:51:14,970 --> 00:51:15,070
Right here.

1559
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:17,870
Yeah, Cooking Any Percent right here with microwaves.

1560
00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:20,370
We're like revolutionizing tech right now.

1561
00:51:21,070 --> 00:51:21,810
Hell yeah!

1562
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:22,050
Yeah.

1563
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:24,410
We're fucking...

1564
00:51:24,410 --> 00:51:26,190
We're running speedrun techs, guys.

1565
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,810
We're just gonna go with oil.

1566
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:30,310
Oh God, I'm out of oil.

1567
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:31,510
It's fine.

1568
00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:33,270
Wait, you're running out of oil?

1569
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:34,710
I thought you prepared for this.

1570
00:51:37,850 --> 00:51:39,270
Alright, so what's next?

1571
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:40,250
What do we do next?

1572
00:51:41,350 --> 00:51:41,830
So...

1573
00:51:41,830 --> 00:51:43,150
TikTok three minutes counter.

1574
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:44,710
We're gonna go...

1575
00:51:44,710 --> 00:51:45,270
TikTok.

1576
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:47,050
You said three minutes.

1577
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:47,950
Now we're just gonna put...

1578
00:51:47,950 --> 00:51:50,750
Now we're just gonna put this in an open mic...

1579
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:52,150
How do I not have any microwaves?

1580
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:52,750
Oh, wait, no.

1581
00:51:52,770 --> 00:51:53,490
This one we can't use.

1582
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:55,130
Wait, why can't we use that?

1583
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:57,590
Then that's nine microwaves, you liar.

1584
00:51:57,810 --> 00:51:58,090
You know what?

1585
00:51:58,210 --> 00:51:58,610
You're right.

1586
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:01,550
I was like...

1587
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:03,050
It's missing a...

1588
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:03,130
You made me clickbait.

1589
00:52:03,130 --> 00:52:04,210
It's missing a turntable.

1590
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:08,050
I wrote ten microwaves.

1591
00:52:10,510 --> 00:52:13,210
How am I supposed to clickbait if it's false?

1592
00:52:13,870 --> 00:52:13,890
Oh.

1593
00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:16,950
I don't know.

1594
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:18,090
Every YouTuber seems to do it.

1595
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:22,830
Yeah, but I'm different.

1596
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:24,790
Build different?

1597
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:25,310
I...

1598
00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:27,150
I'm build different.

1599
00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:29,710
Ten microwaves minus one.

1600
00:52:31,870 --> 00:52:32,270
All right, we're gonna keep cooking this?

1601
00:52:32,270 --> 00:52:33,210
All right, what's next, Tim?

1602
00:52:33,210 --> 00:52:34,790
Oh, God, it exploded all...

1603
00:52:35,870 --> 00:52:37,810
I got a white creamy explosion everywhere, guys.

1604
00:52:38,110 --> 00:52:38,710
I'm sorry.

1605
00:52:39,310 --> 00:52:39,710
Whoa.

1606
00:52:40,070 --> 00:52:40,910
Wait, don't, don't, no, shh.

1607
00:52:41,010 --> 00:52:41,490
No, no, no.

1608
00:52:41,590 --> 00:52:42,670
She's gonna get demonetized.

1609
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:46,090
No, I wanna see.

1610
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:47,790
You wanna see it?

1611
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:49,090
I wanna see.

1612
00:52:49,110 --> 00:52:50,030
The white creamy explosion.

1613
00:52:50,430 --> 00:52:50,550
Ugh.

1614
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:51,350
Whoa.

1615
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:51,970
Whoa.

1616
00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:54,290
Extra creamy.

1617
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:55,510
Whoa.

1618
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:55,770
Extra.

1619
00:52:56,130 --> 00:52:58,750
Oh, my God.

1620
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:00,470
What happened?

1621
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:02,750
What?

1622
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:04,470
Oh, that's hot.

1623
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:05,290
What happened?

1624
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:06,270
Why did that happen?

1625
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:08,630
It got too hot and it boiled over.

1626
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:12,230
You know when it gets too...

1627
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:12,650
Yeah.

1628
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:16,290
You know when it gets too hot and steamy and then you get really excited and then it just...

1629
00:53:16,290 --> 00:53:17,730
You can't help it and it just kind of...

1630
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:18,830
Gets everywhere.

1631
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:20,490
It happens to everyone, okay?

1632
00:53:20,790 --> 00:53:21,290
All right?

1633
00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:22,350
It's not just me.

1634
00:53:22,590 --> 00:53:23,390
It's not just me.

1635
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:24,790
It happens to everyone.

1636
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:27,230
Just in cooking, right?

1637
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:28,870
Yeah, just, yeah.

1638
00:53:28,970 --> 00:53:29,910
In cooking, right?

1639
00:53:30,070 --> 00:53:30,570
In Minecraft?

1640
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:31,890
Yep, yep, yep.

1641
00:53:31,990 --> 00:53:33,070
In Minecraft, yep, yep, yep.

1642
00:53:33,590 --> 00:53:34,650
Yeah, nothing else.

1643
00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:35,730
Absolutely nothing else.

1644
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:36,450
All right.

1645
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:37,870
So here, now we have...

1646
00:53:37,870 --> 00:53:39,870
Now we have all of our starchy water and stuff.

1647
00:53:40,090 --> 00:53:40,310
Yeah.

1648
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:41,730
We're gonna put our potatoes in.

1649
00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:43,170
So this is how we're gonna be making our...

1650
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:43,310
Ah!

1651
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:44,230
Oh, that's hot.

1652
00:53:44,950 --> 00:53:45,770
Ah, that's hot.

1653
00:53:46,450 --> 00:53:49,230
Guys, he's in pain for our pleasure, guys.

1654
00:53:50,410 --> 00:53:51,670
And then we're also gonna have...

1655
00:53:51,830 --> 00:53:52,930
I love streaming.

1656
00:53:57,370 --> 00:53:59,350
We're gonna have our clams as well.

1657
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:00,790
We're gonna make our clam chowder.

1658
00:54:01,430 --> 00:54:01,870
Right?

1659
00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:04,150
And so these are all technically already cooked.

1660
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:05,750
Um...

1661
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:07,290
And then...

1662
00:54:07,290 --> 00:54:09,730
And then we have our seasonings and we have our stuff in there.

1663
00:54:09,730 --> 00:54:10,350
Oh, no.

1664
00:54:10,690 --> 00:54:11,510
That is...

1665
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:12,610
That's gonna explode again.

1666
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:13,270
That's...

1667
00:54:13,270 --> 00:54:13,970
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

1668
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:15,030
Wait, how is it gonna explode?

1669
00:54:15,770 --> 00:54:18,170
Uh, because we're gonna put it back in the microwave.

1670
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:18,950
Oh!

1671
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:22,870
What if you put those film wraps on top of it?

1672
00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:23,810
Would that work?

1673
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:24,770
Uh, because...

1674
00:54:24,770 --> 00:54:25,850
No, it would...

1675
00:54:25,850 --> 00:54:27,310
It would still unfortunately explode.

1676
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:27,910
What?

1677
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:29,370
But there's a cover.

1678
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:33,650
Because the steam would make it explode.

1679
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:34,390
Oh!

1680
00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:34,730
Yeah.

1681
00:54:34,870 --> 00:54:36,170
Oh, I see.

1682
00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:36,690
And here's our salmon.

1683
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:38,530
And yeah, that's...

1684
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:38,950
Oh, jeez.

1685
00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:39,190
Ow.

1686
00:54:39,790 --> 00:54:41,230
Don't touch hot plates, guys.

1687
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:41,930
That's...

1688
00:54:41,930 --> 00:54:41,970
Yeah.

1689
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:43,590
Don't do it.

1690
00:54:43,630 --> 00:54:44,810
He's gonna do it anyway.

1691
00:54:44,970 --> 00:54:45,870
But don't do it, guys.

1692
00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:46,650
I'm gonna do it anyway.

1693
00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:48,350
For your entertainment.

1694
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:49,750
Buy the Toki Blade.

1695
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:53,750
Help me pay my hospital bills after this stream.

1696
00:54:54,690 --> 00:54:57,010
Nor, like, help him pay for his ambulance.

1697
00:54:57,810 --> 00:54:58,870
Oh, my God.

1698
00:54:59,010 --> 00:54:59,450
Look at that.

1699
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:00,190
Oh!

1700
00:55:00,870 --> 00:55:01,270
Oral rice.

1701
00:55:01,410 --> 00:55:02,130
Look at that.

1702
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:03,210
Right?

1703
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:03,850
Yeah.

1704
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:05,850
And then what you can do is you can peel away the skin.

1705
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:06,610
Oh!

1706
00:55:06,610 --> 00:55:08,490
The skin comes right off.

1707
00:55:10,070 --> 00:55:10,510
Oh!

1708
00:55:11,090 --> 00:55:11,510
Oh!

1709
00:55:12,070 --> 00:55:13,350
It came right off.

1710
00:55:13,570 --> 00:55:14,190
Just like that.

1711
00:55:14,450 --> 00:55:14,490
Ha!

1712
00:55:16,010 --> 00:55:16,450
Right?

1713
00:55:16,870 --> 00:55:16,990
Yeah.

1714
00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:17,670
And then what came here?

1715
00:55:17,670 --> 00:55:20,190
Look at all these things we're able to make with the microwave.

1716
00:55:21,470 --> 00:55:24,550
And then also, we are going to fry kale chips.

1717
00:55:26,910 --> 00:55:29,150
Wait, you can fry in the microwave?

1718
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:30,470
Yup.

1719
00:55:31,290 --> 00:55:32,130
Guys, look at that.

1720
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:33,910
You don't even need an air fryer, guys.

1721
00:55:34,210 --> 00:55:35,890
You can do this in the microwave, too.

1722
00:55:36,090 --> 00:55:36,870
It's all in one.

1723
00:55:37,070 --> 00:55:39,610
Where the– You can make rice.

1724
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:41,390
You can use it as a fryer?

1725
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:42,750
That's crazy!

1726
00:55:43,270 --> 00:55:43,770
Where's the plastic wrap?

1727
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:45,390
What's the plastic wrap?

1728
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:45,770
Where's the plastic wrap?

1729
00:55:45,770 --> 00:55:46,010
Steve!

1730
00:55:46,390 --> 00:55:46,830
Terrance!

1731
00:55:47,030 --> 00:55:48,070
Where's the plastic wrap?

1732
00:55:48,330 --> 00:55:48,770
Terrance!

1733
00:55:49,410 --> 00:55:50,970
Terrance took the plastic wrap!

1734
00:55:53,470 --> 00:55:55,090
Where is it, Terrence?

1735
00:55:57,010 --> 00:55:57,610
All right.

1736
00:56:03,490 --> 00:56:06,010
All right, we're out of... we're gonna use a nice olive oil.

1737
00:56:06,550 --> 00:56:07,450
Oh, nice.

1738
00:56:08,270 --> 00:56:11,590
That's some good-ass shit in my microwave.

1739
00:56:12,430 --> 00:56:14,490
Mmm, that's some good shit right there.

1740
00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:17,270
All right, so watch this.

1741
00:56:17,850 --> 00:56:29,390
What you can do is, number one, you need to get good quality plastic wrap, so this stuff will not melt in the microwave until you get it to very, very high temperatures.

1742
00:56:29,990 --> 00:56:31,850
And so, you know, Costco ones.

1743
00:56:32,510 --> 00:56:36,730
And then all you gotta do, you have your leafy greens like kale, right?

1744
00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:37,370
Yeah.

1745
00:56:37,710 --> 00:56:42,410
I'm not using an optimal container for this, so we're just gonna pretend like it's optimal.

1746
00:56:42,890 --> 00:56:45,090
Wait, you can only do two at once?

1747
00:56:45,630 --> 00:56:49,150
Okay, look, if I had a better container, but I'm out of containers.

1748
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:49,710
Okay?

1749
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:50,410
Sorry, Chef.

1750
00:56:50,590 --> 00:56:50,950
Sorry, Chef.

1751
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:52,150
I'll just have to do it faster, Chef.

1752
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:52,970
Yeah.

1753
00:56:53,230 --> 00:56:54,210
And then you rub it with...

1754
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:54,210
You better.

1755
00:56:55,110 --> 00:56:56,870
And then you just rub it with oil.

1756
00:56:57,090 --> 00:56:59,190
And just oil it up till it's nice and shiny.

1757
00:57:01,770 --> 00:57:02,550
Just like that.

1758
00:57:02,850 --> 00:57:04,130
And we do a little bit of salt.

1759
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:05,750
That's how I like my kale.

1760
00:57:06,270 --> 00:57:07,610
Nice and shiny.

1761
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:11,610
A little bit of salt.

1762
00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:12,250
What?

1763
00:57:12,370 --> 00:57:13,090
Put MSG.

1764
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:15,190
Hell yeah!

1765
00:57:15,330 --> 00:57:16,330
It's the spirit!

1766
00:57:16,930 --> 00:57:16,990
Yeah!

1767
00:57:17,330 --> 00:57:17,530
Yeah!

1768
00:57:17,770 --> 00:57:18,430
She knows!

1769
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:19,890
She knows the tech!

1770
00:57:21,270 --> 00:57:23,650
Put that MSG shit on it!

1771
00:57:24,410 --> 00:57:25,070
Woo!

1772
00:57:26,050 --> 00:57:26,290
Woo!

1773
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:27,970
MSG!

1774
00:57:30,050 --> 00:57:30,830
That's right.

1775
00:57:31,870 --> 00:57:33,090
And then this just goes in.

1776
00:57:33,330 --> 00:57:33,550
Yeah.

1777
00:57:34,370 --> 00:57:35,410
And 30 seconds.

1778
00:57:35,830 --> 00:57:36,130
Okay.

1779
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:36,730
Should be enough.

1780
00:57:37,010 --> 00:57:37,330
Okay.

1781
00:57:38,170 --> 00:57:38,590
Now what?

1782
00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:39,110
Should be enough.

1783
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:40,570
Alright, I'm gonna transfer this actually.

1784
00:57:42,950 --> 00:57:43,610
Bigger bowl.

1785
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:47,230
Or...

1786
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:48,190
I guess I could...

1787
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:49,890
That's alright.

1788
00:57:50,130 --> 00:57:50,410
You...

1789
00:57:51,030 --> 00:57:52,610
You can push that as a...

1790
00:57:53,090 --> 00:57:55,370
It's a business expense if you break it.

1791
00:57:55,790 --> 00:57:55,990
Hot!

1792
00:57:55,990 --> 00:57:56,070
Hot!

1793
00:57:57,030 --> 00:57:57,150
Ah!

1794
00:57:57,810 --> 00:57:57,910
Ah!

1795
00:57:58,810 --> 00:57:59,250
Whoa!

1796
00:57:59,990 --> 00:58:00,310
So...

1797
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:02,190
This is gonna be our clam chowder.

1798
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:04,830
I know the cuts aren't the greatest.

1799
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:05,690
We'll just strain it.

1800
00:58:05,790 --> 00:58:06,210
It's fine.

1801
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:07,030
Don't worry about it.

1802
00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:07,330
Wait, guys.

1803
00:58:07,330 --> 00:58:08,430
I realize I can...

1804
00:58:08,430 --> 00:58:11,230
I can order clam chowder and then I can use...

1805
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:13,510
I can pretend that this is my business expense.

1806
00:58:14,610 --> 00:58:16,490
He's making clam chowder, guys.

1807
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:20,130
And then...

1808
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:22,850
Where'd it go?

1809
00:58:23,030 --> 00:58:23,230
Yeah?

1810
00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:24,030
What do you do next?

1811
00:58:24,030 --> 00:58:24,430
Thicken it?

1812
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:26,090
Because...

1813
00:58:26,090 --> 00:58:26,890
This isn't thick enough, right?

1814
00:58:27,330 --> 00:58:28,410
It's just like...

1815
00:58:28,410 --> 00:58:29,270
It's watery.

1816
00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:30,170
It's uh...

1817
00:58:30,170 --> 00:58:30,410
Yeah.

1818
00:58:30,790 --> 00:58:31,330
It's watery.

1819
00:58:31,530 --> 00:58:32,570
And we like the...

1820
00:58:32,570 --> 00:58:33,330
We like the white stuff.

1821
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:36,550
We like it nice and thick and creamy and really coating.

1822
00:58:36,910 --> 00:58:37,510
You really...

1823
00:58:37,510 --> 00:58:38,090
When you...

1824
00:58:38,090 --> 00:58:46,150
When you put this in your mouth, you really want this to like coat your mouth and like really get, you know, the flavors of that thick creamy white liquid...

1825
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:46,430
Yeah.

1826
00:58:46,770 --> 00:58:48,710
Just lingering in the back of your throat.

1827
00:58:48,870 --> 00:58:49,350
God damn it!

1828
00:58:49,910 --> 00:58:52,270
That's how you want those clam chowders.

1829
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:55,130
That's the chowder in clam chowder.

1830
00:58:55,250 --> 00:58:56,430
So what do you do for that?

1831
00:58:57,330 --> 00:59:00,190
And so in order to thicken it up, we use cornstarch.

1832
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:00,910
There's lots of...

1833
00:59:00,910 --> 00:59:02,710
Secondary use for cornstarch in the kitchen.

1834
00:59:02,890 --> 00:59:03,830
Do you know what it is?

1835
00:59:04,090 --> 00:59:04,850
What is it?

1836
00:59:06,490 --> 00:59:07,610
It's not for food use.

1837
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:09,010
I'll tell you when you're older.

1838
00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:12,810
It, uh, unsticks things.

1839
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:16,700
Eh?

1840
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:17,100
Eh?

1841
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:17,400
No?

1842
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:17,780
No one?

1843
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:18,000
Chat?

1844
00:59:22,150 --> 00:59:22,790
All right.

1845
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:23,930
And then now...

1846
00:59:24,570 --> 00:59:25,090
It's...

1847
00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:26,210
Unsticks what?

1848
00:59:28,990 --> 00:59:29,850
You just...

1849
00:59:29,850 --> 00:59:30,890
You just...

1850
00:59:30,890 --> 00:59:32,130
You just drop a little down there.

1851
00:59:33,890 --> 00:59:34,730
Unsticks what?

1852
00:59:35,390 --> 00:59:35,970
Don't worry about it.

1853
00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:36,770
It's my birthday.

1854
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:37,450
Tell me.

1855
00:59:37,710 --> 00:59:38,310
I'm already old.

1856
00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:39,250
It's my birthday.

1857
00:59:40,090 --> 00:59:40,810
Is it?

1858
00:59:40,930 --> 00:59:41,790
It's my birthday.

1859
00:59:42,350 --> 00:59:43,170
What is...

1860
00:59:43,170 --> 00:59:43,930
What does that mean?

1861
00:59:45,550 --> 00:59:45,910
Um...

1862
00:59:45,910 --> 00:59:46,510
Uh...

1863
00:59:46,510 --> 00:59:47,090
Your, uh...

1864
00:59:47,090 --> 00:59:47,510
Your huevos.

1865
00:59:47,790 --> 00:59:48,370
Your, uh...

1866
00:59:48,370 --> 00:59:50,150
Your, um...

1867
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:51,050
Uh...

1868
00:59:51,050 --> 00:59:51,230
You know?

1869
00:59:51,370 --> 00:59:52,730
Like, um...

1870
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:53,550
Your, uh...

1871
00:59:53,550 --> 00:59:53,730
Tomatoes.

1872
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:55,350
In the summer especially.

1873
00:59:55,670 --> 00:59:57,290
When the tomatoes are just a little, uh...

1874
00:59:57,290 --> 00:59:58,010
A little moist.

1875
00:59:58,190 --> 00:59:58,310
You know?

1876
00:59:59,490 --> 00:59:59,850
Yeah.

1877
00:59:59,950 --> 01:00:01,450
And how many times have you done it?

1878
01:00:02,290 --> 01:00:02,950
Don't worry about it.

1879
01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:04,090
Don't worry about it.

1880
01:00:04,210 --> 01:00:05,430
If you're worried about it, don't be.

1881
01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:06,530
Have you concerns?

1882
01:00:07,350 --> 01:00:07,950
Unconcern yourself.

1883
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:09,490
Unconcern yourself.

1884
01:00:09,730 --> 01:00:11,050
Wait, is it for men?

1885
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:12,470
Do you guys do it all the time?

1886
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:13,230
Yes.

1887
01:00:13,230 --> 01:00:14,370
At chat, do you do it?

1888
01:00:14,710 --> 01:00:15,010
Yes.

1889
01:00:15,010 --> 01:00:15,730
Have you used corn...

1890
01:00:15,730 --> 01:00:16,630
Oh, my gosh.

1891
01:00:16,890 --> 01:00:17,490
Endorsed fire.

1892
01:00:17,830 --> 01:00:21,330
So, if it's sticky, you can unstick it with that.

1893
01:00:21,550 --> 01:00:23,110
With cornstarch, guys.

1894
01:00:23,830 --> 01:00:24,450
And look at that.

1895
01:00:24,510 --> 01:00:24,770
Look at that.

1896
01:00:24,850 --> 01:00:25,770
Look at how beautiful that is.

1897
01:00:26,490 --> 01:00:27,430
Oh, look at that.

1898
01:00:29,370 --> 01:00:30,510
God, I've done it.

1899
01:00:30,510 --> 01:00:31,090
So, in just three minutes...

1900
01:00:31,090 --> 01:00:31,750
Oh, shit.

1901
01:00:33,090 --> 01:00:34,690
In three minutes, we have an infusion.

1902
01:00:35,950 --> 01:00:36,510
Oh, man.

1903
01:00:36,530 --> 01:00:37,070
That smells amazing.

1904
01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:39,210
That's gonna be great for dipping on...

1905
01:00:39,210 --> 01:00:40,650
on Hananese chicken rice.

1906
01:00:41,110 --> 01:00:41,630
Oh!

1907
01:00:42,330 --> 01:00:43,250
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1908
01:00:43,990 --> 01:00:44,290
And we're just gonna set that aside.

1909
01:00:44,290 --> 01:00:45,130
And we're just gonna get everything plated.

1910
01:00:45,130 --> 01:00:47,530
Someone says, just use baby powder.

1911
01:00:47,730 --> 01:00:48,830
Wait, but what's cheaper?

1912
01:00:48,830 --> 01:00:50,210
Baby powder or cornstarch?

1913
01:00:51,350 --> 01:00:52,610
Well, here's the thing, right?

1914
01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:55,470
Cornstarch is a business expense for restaurants.

1915
01:00:55,470 --> 01:00:55,590
Oh!

1916
01:00:55,810 --> 01:00:56,590
That's true!

1917
01:00:57,350 --> 01:00:58,030
If you...

1918
01:01:02,090 --> 01:01:03,590
Guys, you can't...

1919
01:01:03,590 --> 01:01:09,550
You can't put a tax deductible on baby powder unless you have a baby.

1920
01:01:11,890 --> 01:01:14,650
So, this is a bacon just for the clam chowder.

1921
01:01:14,650 --> 01:01:17,330
Guys, that's what all the chefs are doing at your Michelin star restaurant.

1922
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:18,210
It's true.

1923
01:01:18,490 --> 01:01:18,890
Don't...

1924
01:01:18,890 --> 01:01:19,010
Wait.

1925
01:01:20,650 --> 01:01:21,510
Wait a minute.

1926
01:01:21,670 --> 01:01:22,890
And we wash our hands afterwards.

1927
01:01:23,090 --> 01:01:23,310
Wait a minute.

1928
01:01:23,310 --> 01:01:24,010
Just so we're clear.

1929
01:01:24,010 --> 01:01:24,850
Don't...

1930
01:01:24,850 --> 01:01:27,630
Guys, we know how hot and sweaty the kitchen gets, guys.

1931
01:01:27,730 --> 01:01:30,410
Don't order anything with cornstarch at your restaurant.

1932
01:01:30,850 --> 01:01:32,830
At your local restaurant, guys.

1933
01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:36,290
Don't order anything with cornstarch at your local restaurant chat.

1934
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:37,250
Don't...

1935
01:01:38,650 --> 01:01:39,250
Okay.

1936
01:01:39,590 --> 01:01:39,970
Look.

1937
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:43,110
There are two containers of cornstarch.

1938
01:01:43,830 --> 01:01:44,430
Wait a minute.

1939
01:01:44,430 --> 01:01:47,370
One has always marked not for food use for a reason.

1940
01:01:50,330 --> 01:01:52,430
I'm never eating again.

1941
01:01:52,430 --> 01:01:53,730
You think...

1942
01:01:53,730 --> 01:01:55,350
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1943
01:01:55,930 --> 01:01:57,710
But don't eat everything...

1944
01:01:57,710 --> 01:01:58,750
Everything has cornstarch.

1945
01:02:00,270 --> 01:02:00,790
Oh, yeah.

1946
01:02:00,790 --> 01:02:01,250
Never eat, guys.

1947
01:02:01,490 --> 01:02:04,430
Maybe we should just start cooking at home instead of eating out.

1948
01:02:05,010 --> 01:02:05,250
All right.

1949
01:02:05,750 --> 01:02:06,350
Ha, ha, ha.

1950
01:02:07,070 --> 01:02:08,610
Look what you did, Tim.

1951
01:02:08,770 --> 01:02:10,670
My chat's paranoid now.

1952
01:02:10,970 --> 01:02:12,850
They'll never go to a restaurant again.

1953
01:02:12,850 --> 01:02:12,990
That they should be.

1954
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:23,790
Wait, actually, reveal to us a deep, dark secret from your Mission Start restaurant days that chefs don't want to tell patrons.

1955
01:02:24,090 --> 01:02:24,890
Leak one.

1956
01:02:25,850 --> 01:02:27,130
Like a true one.

1957
01:02:27,230 --> 01:02:28,130
Don't lie to us.

1958
01:02:28,710 --> 01:02:29,590
Reveal the secrets.

1959
01:02:30,510 --> 01:02:36,230
So, I would cook plates that were like $50 each, and then I would be making $10 an hour.

1960
01:02:37,910 --> 01:02:42,230
And $10 an hour, not including the overtime, we would always be clocking out.

1961
01:02:42,230 --> 01:02:43,770
And then going back to work.

1962
01:02:44,170 --> 01:02:45,250
And then we would always...

1963
01:02:45,890 --> 01:02:50,190
And basically, despite graduating from culinary school, we're going to Mission List our restaurant.

1964
01:02:50,570 --> 01:02:55,450
Literally, when I left the shift, I would go get McDonald's because, you know, they didn't feed us either.

1965
01:02:55,690 --> 01:02:59,030
And the person working at McDonald's would be making more money than I would.

1966
01:02:59,070 --> 01:03:00,590
Wait, what?

1967
01:03:02,010 --> 01:03:05,550
On top of that, half the kitchen were externs.

1968
01:03:06,070 --> 01:03:07,870
Unpaid externs that flew over from Korea.

1969
01:03:08,490 --> 01:03:08,890
What?

1970
01:03:10,050 --> 01:03:12,010
Wait, name the restaurant.

1971
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:15,090
Every Michelin star restaurant.

1972
01:03:15,370 --> 01:03:16,170
Every single one.

1973
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:16,810
Every Michelin.

1974
01:03:16,970 --> 01:03:18,810
Wait, that's so...

1975
01:03:18,810 --> 01:03:18,910
Yep.

1976
01:03:19,150 --> 01:03:20,310
Wait, what?

1977
01:03:22,210 --> 01:03:22,770
Yep.

1978
01:03:22,770 --> 01:03:25,770
So, it was like more so like passion to do that.

1979
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:27,810
Okay, but what about the food though?

1980
01:03:27,990 --> 01:03:30,190
Like any deep dark secrets about the food?

1981
01:03:32,990 --> 01:03:33,470
Um...

1982
01:03:33,470 --> 01:03:37,370
Yeah, there's a... there's a lot more frozen stuff being used in Michelin star restaurants than you would think.

1983
01:03:37,990 --> 01:03:38,690
Like what?

1984
01:03:39,090 --> 01:03:39,350
And because...

1985
01:03:39,990 --> 01:03:40,470
Just...

1986
01:03:40,470 --> 01:03:40,590
Uh...

1987
01:03:40,590 --> 01:03:41,310
Everything.

1988
01:03:41,590 --> 01:03:42,590
From uni to...

1989
01:03:42,590 --> 01:03:43,690
From uni to...

1990
01:03:43,690 --> 01:03:44,530
Not the uni!

1991
01:03:45,290 --> 01:03:45,430
To like...

1992
01:03:45,430 --> 01:03:47,050
To shrimp to...

1993
01:03:47,050 --> 01:03:47,810
All kinds of stuff.

1994
01:03:47,970 --> 01:03:50,610
Because like at the end of the day, things just don't keep that well.

1995
01:03:50,770 --> 01:03:52,310
And you can't fly everything over.

1996
01:03:52,570 --> 01:03:55,310
Went to a Michelin star restaurant for my birthday!

1997
01:03:57,550 --> 01:03:58,590
I paid...

1998
01:03:58,590 --> 01:04:00,290
I paid $200!

1999
01:04:01,510 --> 01:04:02,490
That sounds good.

2000
01:04:02,810 --> 01:04:04,330
For frozen food?

2001
01:04:07,610 --> 01:04:08,650
And here!

2002
01:04:08,830 --> 01:04:10,210
And then now, check out the scale.

2003
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:11,090
Whoa!

2004
01:04:11,090 --> 01:04:11,650
You guys ready to hear it?

2005
01:04:12,050 --> 01:04:12,090
Oh!

2006
01:04:12,350 --> 01:04:12,870
Getting close.

2007
01:04:13,050 --> 01:04:13,750
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2008
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:15,770
I got scammed guys.

2009
01:04:16,630 --> 01:04:17,210
Where is it?

2010
01:04:17,650 --> 01:04:18,170
Whoa!

2011
01:04:20,170 --> 01:04:21,550
You fried it!

2012
01:04:21,810 --> 01:04:24,190
Guys, and it's faster than an air fryer!

2013
01:04:24,890 --> 01:04:25,230
Yep!

2014
01:04:25,830 --> 01:04:26,630
Look at that!

2015
01:04:26,910 --> 01:04:26,950
Oh!

2016
01:04:26,950 --> 01:04:27,450
So...

2017
01:04:28,850 --> 01:04:29,970
Now we have all this stuff.

2018
01:04:30,250 --> 01:04:30,570
Oh!

2019
01:04:30,770 --> 01:04:32,250
Let me actually cook this one a little bit more.

2020
01:04:32,370 --> 01:04:32,550
That's crispy!

2021
01:04:32,550 --> 01:04:35,910
Guys, re-wash the body if you want to make like crispy kale.

2022
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:40,510
Wait, so you would eat like McDonald's nuggies while you're cooking?

2023
01:04:41,490 --> 01:04:41,930
Yeah!

2024
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:44,450
Actually, a secret of...

2025
01:04:44,450 --> 01:04:45,930
A secret of...

2026
01:04:45,930 --> 01:04:46,150
So...

2027
01:04:46,470 --> 01:04:46,570
Oh!

2028
01:04:46,730 --> 01:04:48,970
Another huge secret is that like...

2029
01:04:48,970 --> 01:04:52,650
Everyone assumes that Michelin star restaurants and stuff are eating really well all the time.

2030
01:04:52,950 --> 01:04:53,150
Nah!

2031
01:04:53,290 --> 01:04:56,230
When we went back home, it was ramen and PB&J.

2032
01:04:56,230 --> 01:04:56,790
Like...

2033
01:04:56,790 --> 01:04:57,890
We just spent all the time cooking.

2034
01:04:57,990 --> 01:04:59,130
We didn't want to cook shit for ourselves.

2035
01:04:59,290 --> 01:04:59,970
That's so true though.

2036
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:00,410
That was most common.

2037
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:00,970
Yeah!

2038
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:02,830
Cause you're too tired from cooking.

2039
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:03,470
Yup!

2040
01:05:04,370 --> 01:05:05,550
And not only that...

2041
01:05:06,610 --> 01:05:06,930
Um...

2042
01:05:06,930 --> 01:05:09,870
Not only that, but we would actually, uh...

2043
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:11,810
Um...

2044
01:05:11,810 --> 01:05:12,090
We...

2045
01:05:12,090 --> 01:05:12,370
We...

2046
01:05:12,370 --> 01:05:13,830
We wouldn't get like any of the...

2047
01:05:13,830 --> 01:05:15,290
We really wouldn't get any of the food over there.

2048
01:05:15,570 --> 01:05:15,870
Uh-huh.

2049
01:05:15,990 --> 01:05:16,170
Either.

2050
01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:17,090
So like...

2051
01:05:17,490 --> 01:05:20,010
Sometimes when people would be like, Oh yeah, like, how does this taste?

2052
01:05:20,090 --> 01:05:21,150
You'd be like, I don't know, I just make it.

2053
01:05:23,470 --> 01:05:23,790
Sometimes...

2054
01:05:23,790 --> 01:05:24,150
I would...

2055
01:05:24,150 --> 01:05:27,450
At the end of the day, When they had like, tuna they were supposed to throw out.

2056
01:05:27,610 --> 01:05:28,170
Because it expired.

2057
01:05:28,350 --> 01:05:29,150
I would just like, sneak it.

2058
01:05:29,270 --> 01:05:29,850
I would just be like...

2059
01:05:29,850 --> 01:05:31,110
Wait, really?

2060
01:05:31,330 --> 01:05:31,910
You would sneak...

2061
01:05:31,910 --> 01:05:33,710
I mean, it would be good ass tuna though.

2062
01:05:35,070 --> 01:05:35,890
To be fair.

2063
01:05:36,030 --> 01:05:37,050
It would be good ass tuna.

2064
01:05:37,790 --> 01:05:38,210
It is.

2065
01:05:38,310 --> 01:05:38,430
Yeah.

2066
01:05:38,530 --> 01:05:38,650
Yeah.

2067
01:05:38,770 --> 01:05:39,710
You don't want to waste that.

2068
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:42,170
It was expired, but you know, like...

2069
01:05:43,150 --> 01:05:44,750
I mean, it's just one day.

2070
01:05:44,990 --> 01:05:45,210
You know?

2071
01:05:45,350 --> 01:05:47,650
One day expiration date is not that bad.

2072
01:05:48,370 --> 01:05:50,730
Expiration dates are suggested, guys.

2073
01:05:50,910 --> 01:05:52,210
That's what Tim is trying to endorse.

2074
01:05:53,190 --> 01:05:53,590
That's true.

2075
01:05:53,590 --> 01:05:53,670
Wait!

2076
01:05:54,570 --> 01:05:55,750
Guys, you heard that?

2077
01:05:55,870 --> 01:05:58,990
Tim says expiration dates are only a suggestion.

2078
01:05:59,270 --> 01:06:02,470
And that's from a culinary expert.

2079
01:06:03,730 --> 01:06:05,290
Graduated from cooking school.

2080
01:06:06,710 --> 01:06:07,430
All right.

2081
01:06:09,650 --> 01:06:11,030
You heard that, guys?

2082
01:06:12,630 --> 01:06:13,430
All right, guys.

2083
01:06:13,590 --> 01:06:17,910
I'm gonna need you right now to go buy the Doki Blade and the full bundle connection.

2084
01:06:18,070 --> 01:06:18,630
Cuz, um...

2085
01:06:19,670 --> 01:06:19,890
Yeah?

2086
01:06:20,350 --> 01:06:20,570
Mm-hmm.

2087
01:06:21,090 --> 01:06:21,470
Lawyers?

2088
01:06:21,710 --> 01:06:22,310
Oh, God.

2089
01:06:22,510 --> 01:06:22,750
Again?

2090
01:06:23,550 --> 01:06:24,510
How many lawsuits?

2091
01:06:25,350 --> 01:06:25,830
Yay!

2092
01:06:26,070 --> 01:06:26,950
Not on me though!

2093
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:31,450
I'm gonna need you to go buy the collections right now.

2094
01:06:31,450 --> 01:06:32,930
Cuz I gotta pay for all these lawsuits.

2095
01:06:33,110 --> 01:06:33,470
Yay!

2096
01:06:33,730 --> 01:06:34,710
After all the things that you said.

2097
01:06:34,710 --> 01:06:36,610
I'm one of those lawsuits, guys.

2098
01:06:37,270 --> 01:06:37,670
I'm...

2099
01:06:40,090 --> 01:06:41,810
And I'm one of them.

2100
01:06:42,850 --> 01:06:43,370
All right.

2101
01:06:44,110 --> 01:06:44,910
And what...

2102
01:06:44,910 --> 01:06:47,250
And what is food without dessert, right?

2103
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:48,870
Oh, true, true, true.

2104
01:06:49,490 --> 01:06:49,890
We...

2105
01:06:49,890 --> 01:06:50,670
Oh, God, I...

2106
01:06:50,670 --> 01:06:51,410
Do I have a... Yes.

2107
01:06:51,550 --> 01:06:52,470
Okay, this is not branded.

2108
01:06:52,610 --> 01:06:52,810
Perfect.

2109
01:06:53,330 --> 01:06:55,190
So, we're gonna make dessert as well.

2110
01:06:55,350 --> 01:06:55,730
Okay.

2111
01:06:56,870 --> 01:06:58,030
With our Life is Hard mug.

2112
01:06:59,830 --> 01:07:01,210
It's the only non-branded mug I have.

2113
01:07:01,270 --> 01:07:01,870
Life is hard.

2114
01:07:01,890 --> 01:07:02,310
So, very simple.

2115
01:07:02,630 --> 01:07:02,990
We have power?

2116
01:07:02,990 --> 01:07:04,770
You buy this when you were a chef too?

2117
01:07:06,890 --> 01:07:08,590
Life is hard right now.

2118
01:07:08,870 --> 01:07:09,010
Okay.

2119
01:07:10,410 --> 01:07:10,890
Flour.

2120
01:07:11,610 --> 01:07:12,090
Sugar.

2121
01:07:13,370 --> 01:07:14,090
Baking powder.

2122
01:07:15,030 --> 01:07:15,350
Yeah.

2123
01:07:17,130 --> 01:07:17,610
Vanilla.

2124
01:07:18,410 --> 01:07:20,430
Let me wash this so it doesn't taste like chicken.

2125
01:07:21,090 --> 01:07:21,330
Uh-huh.

2126
01:07:23,870 --> 01:07:25,130
Life is hard, guys.

2127
01:07:25,270 --> 01:07:25,690
Look at that.

2128
01:07:25,790 --> 01:07:27,050
That's a good-ass mug, actually.

2129
01:07:27,050 --> 01:07:27,750
Yeah.

2130
01:07:28,110 --> 01:07:29,030
I like that look.

2131
01:07:29,330 --> 01:07:29,890
Right?

2132
01:07:31,710 --> 01:07:33,630
I feel that, Kat.

2133
01:07:34,030 --> 01:07:34,650
Me too.

2134
01:07:36,270 --> 01:07:36,870
I feel it.

2135
01:07:36,870 --> 01:07:37,210
Cocoa powder?

2136
01:07:37,710 --> 01:07:38,070
Yeah.

2137
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:42,820
Ooh.

2138
01:07:43,620 --> 01:07:44,340
Chocolate chips.

2139
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:45,300
Chocolate chips.

2140
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:45,600
And then...

2141
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:46,500
Are you taking notes, Kat?

2142
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:47,120
We got...

2143
01:07:49,540 --> 01:07:50,500
We got milk.

2144
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:51,560
Oh.

2145
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:53,920
And then butter.

2146
01:07:54,140 --> 01:07:54,800
We need it melted.

2147
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:55,960
How do we melt butter, guys?

2148
01:07:56,860 --> 01:07:57,420
Microwave!

2149
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:00,680
I feel like...

2150
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:01,160
Doki, you wanna...

2151
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:01,920
You wanna make a microwave?

2152
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:03,580
I feel like we should be selling microwaves right now.

2153
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:04,740
Oh my god, you're right.

2154
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:07,320
A Doki Brandon microwave would go...

2155
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:08,520
Would be so...

2156
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:09,200
So...

2157
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:10,460
Good right now.

2158
01:08:11,340 --> 01:08:13,000
That'll fly off the shelves easily.

2159
01:08:14,380 --> 01:08:15,740
And then we'll have like a little...

2160
01:08:15,740 --> 01:08:16,120
Oh my god.

2161
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:16,960
Guys, wait.

2162
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:21,940
I could have a recipe book for like microwave recipes.

2163
01:08:21,940 --> 01:08:24,640
And then I'll have Tim Ghost write it and I'll take all the credit.

2164
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:27,500
We could do that, guys.

2165
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:30,040
Just imagine my branding and...

2166
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:30,280
Oh.

2167
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:30,380
Okay.

2168
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:31,940
And I mean, you're used to it.

2169
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:33,740
You used to work at a Michelin star restaurant.

2170
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:36,160
So you're used to being taking advantage, right?

2171
01:08:36,820 --> 01:08:37,260
Yeah.

2172
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:38,300
Okay.

2173
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:39,300
Yes, Chef.

2174
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:40,220
Yes, Chef.

2175
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:41,020
Yes, Chef Toki.

2176
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:43,320
Thank you, Chef Toki.

2177
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:48,840
And we could have our own microwave recipe book together.

2178
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:52,140
But like, obviously, you're just a ghost writer, though.

2179
01:08:53,140 --> 01:08:53,320
Yeah.

2180
01:08:54,060 --> 01:08:54,380
Yeah.

2181
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:55,980
I'm nothing, Chef.

2182
01:08:56,460 --> 01:08:57,240
Nothing without you, Chef.

2183
01:08:58,020 --> 01:08:58,680
Thank you, Chef.

2184
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:00,240
Thank you for giving me this opportunity, Chef.

2185
01:09:00,580 --> 01:09:00,900
Yeah.

2186
01:09:02,580 --> 01:09:03,460
No problem.

2187
01:09:03,660 --> 01:09:04,660
No problem, Tim.

2188
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:06,500
I'm always there for you.

2189
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:07,140
Oh, look at that.

2190
01:09:07,420 --> 01:09:08,080
Oh, man.

2191
01:09:08,260 --> 01:09:08,660
Look at that.

2192
01:09:08,660 --> 01:09:09,260
Look at that lobster.

2193
01:09:09,460 --> 01:09:10,580
That looks so good.

2194
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:15,840
And then, important thing about lobster, guys.

2195
01:09:16,020 --> 01:09:16,200
Yeah.

2196
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:17,720
You always want to make sure you cut down the middle.

2197
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:19,080
Right?

2198
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:19,780
Uh-huh.

2199
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:21,780
And then, do you see this?

2200
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:23,040
Yeah.

2201
01:09:23,860 --> 01:09:24,640
What is that?

2202
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:25,640
I'll take that out.

2203
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:26,400
Oh.

2204
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:27,400
That's the shit sack.

2205
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:28,240
Oh.

2206
01:09:28,860 --> 01:09:30,320
Wait, you don't take it out?

2207
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:30,920
No.

2208
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:32,060
You want to take this out.

2209
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:33,160
This is literally...

2210
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:34,600
This is literally...

2211
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:37,300
Wait, what am I making in here?

2212
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:38,540
Oh, sh...

2213
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:42,880
You want to make sure you...

2214
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:43,040
Yeah.

2215
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:43,880
Yeah.

2216
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:46,220
That's butter.

2217
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:47,740
This is butt...

2218
01:09:47,740 --> 01:09:47,940
Yeah.

2219
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:52,160
Get...

2220
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:52,940
Because it's...

2221
01:09:53,340 --> 01:09:54,480
It's the butt, it's the, yeah.

2222
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:57,240
And then, so now we have...

2223
01:09:57,240 --> 01:09:58,620
That's why you're the ghost writer, Tim.

2224
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:02,720
Oh, look at that.

2225
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:03,040
Look at that.

2226
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:03,600
Look at this lobster.

2227
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:05,720
Hey, Leo, you want to see if you can catch this with your mouth?

2228
01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:06,160
What?

2229
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:07,360
You want to catch it with your mouth?

2230
01:10:07,780 --> 01:10:08,420
Yeah, Leo.

2231
01:10:08,420 --> 01:10:10,020
Leo, do it.

2232
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:10,640
All right.

2233
01:10:11,660 --> 01:10:13,360
Three, two, one.

2234
01:10:14,540 --> 01:10:14,980
Whoa!

2235
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:16,920
Oh, wait, did he get it?

2236
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:19,460
Wait, no, no, put that sanitizer.

2237
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:20,600
Use the sanitizer.

2238
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,040
Use the sanitizer.

2239
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:25,740
Yeah, now give it to Tim.

2240
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:26,340
Oh, Leo.

2241
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:27,440
Oh, my God.

2242
01:10:30,820 --> 01:10:32,760
Oh, God, that piece of water.

2243
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:34,760
What I said was just a suggestion.

2244
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,440
He could have not done that, guys.

2245
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:37,380
It's not my fault.

2246
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:39,380
You could have not done that, guys.

2247
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:45,380
I'm being blamed for all kinds of things right now.

2248
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:46,880
I can't believe this.

2249
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:49,360
What I said was just a suggestion, guys.

2250
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:56,980
Look, now we add all of this into the mug.

2251
01:10:57,020 --> 01:10:57,260
Yeah.

2252
01:10:57,400 --> 01:11:01,140
And then we microwave it for about three minutes, I think.

2253
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:02,200
Okay.

2254
01:11:06,460 --> 01:11:08,600
Look, that's my chopsticks, guys.

2255
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:13,280
You can get those chopsticks right now at the Vite Ramen store.

2256
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:15,720
I have chopsticks, too.

2257
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,180
Yeah, that's the sanitizer.

2258
01:11:18,580 --> 01:11:18,680
Yeah.

2259
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:20,080
Look, it's right there.

2260
01:11:21,740 --> 01:11:25,060
You can check out the shop right now pinned in my chat.

2261
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:26,540
And in the description.

2262
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:29,840
Okay, what's next, Tim?

2263
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:30,860
What's next?

2264
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:31,360
All right.

2265
01:11:31,660 --> 01:11:32,580
Now we have dessert.

2266
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:33,480
Uh-huh.

2267
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:35,240
We're gonna start bento plating.

2268
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:37,920
Assuming I have everything done.

2269
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:39,900
Everything's done?

2270
01:11:41,060 --> 01:11:41,920
I think so.

2271
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:42,280
Okay.

2272
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:42,820
That's done.

2273
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:43,280
That's done.

2274
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:44,080
That's done.

2275
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:44,900
That's done.

2276
01:11:46,180 --> 01:11:46,860
That's done.

2277
01:11:47,740 --> 01:11:48,400
That's done.

2278
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:48,900
Yeah.

2279
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:50,960
Yay!

2280
01:11:53,660 --> 01:11:54,600
That's the chicken.

2281
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:55,980
The 40-minute chicken.

2282
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:57,720
God, that's hot.

2283
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:04,160
I think you might need mittens.

2284
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:04,740
No!

2285
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:06,640
I refuse to it!

2286
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:11,080
I gave him a suggestion and he refused.

2287
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:12,780
See, he does have free will, guys.

2288
01:12:14,020 --> 01:12:16,600
Oh my god, did you just put that back in your ear?

2289
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:20,260
Guys, look.

2290
01:12:20,740 --> 01:12:23,040
For legal reasons, I didn't tell him to do that.

2291
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:28,960
For legal reasons, that's not on me.

2292
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:36,100
So an interesting thing you'll notice about this chicken is do you see how the skin is actually a little crispy over here?

2293
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:36,580
Yeah.

2294
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:40,860
It's not browned right now because of all the steam, it won't brown.

2295
01:12:41,220 --> 01:12:46,180
But if we toss this into the oven for just a little bit or the... which I'm gonna go ahead and do because...

2296
01:12:46,180 --> 01:12:46,940
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2297
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:48,100
This is a microwave only.

2298
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:48,900
Damn it!

2299
01:12:48,980 --> 01:12:49,340
You're right!

2300
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:50,440
No, no, no.

2301
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:54,020
The browning is just aesthetic, right?

2302
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:55,120
It doesn't really matter.

2303
01:12:57,520 --> 01:12:58,680
There's no shortcuts here.

2304
01:12:58,680 --> 01:12:59,020
Yeah, but otherwise, you can see.

2305
01:12:59,020 --> 01:12:59,180
There's no shortcuts here.

2306
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:02,460
Otherwise, we cut into it and you'll see.

2307
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:04,540
Ah, jeez, that's hot.

2308
01:13:04,820 --> 01:13:06,400
You can see, that's perfectly cooked.

2309
01:13:06,580 --> 01:13:07,720
Look at the juices.

2310
01:13:07,980 --> 01:13:08,300
Whoa!

2311
01:13:08,380 --> 01:13:09,820
Look at how juicy that is.

2312
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,140
Look at that, guys.

2313
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:12,340
Look at the chicken butt.

2314
01:13:12,700 --> 01:13:12,840
Yeah.

2315
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:13,520
We like chicken butt here.

2316
01:13:14,060 --> 01:13:14,820
Look at that.

2317
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:16,540
Ooh, okay, that looks good.

2318
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:18,600
Oh, oh god.

2319
01:13:18,740 --> 01:13:19,140
You're right.

2320
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:22,100
Put the microwave in the oven, so technically it's microwaved.

2321
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:24,660
If you think about it.

2322
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:28,580
For legal reasons, that's also a joke because I don't want to get sued.

2323
01:13:30,340 --> 01:13:30,700
Okay.

2324
01:13:31,900 --> 01:13:32,400
All right.

2325
01:13:33,140 --> 01:13:34,020
Oh, that's really hot.

2326
01:13:34,180 --> 01:13:34,360
Okay.

2327
01:13:34,460 --> 01:13:34,740
You know what?

2328
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:35,480
We're just going with that.

2329
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:36,000
Yeah?

2330
01:13:36,220 --> 01:13:36,840
All right, now.

2331
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:41,180
Now I'm going to go ahead and clean up a little bit so that we can start plating.

2332
01:13:41,580 --> 01:13:41,940
Yay!

2333
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:43,520
And we will plate two bentos.

2334
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:44,880
Whoa!

2335
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:47,220
Oh my god, guys.

2336
01:13:47,220 --> 01:13:48,300
I'll just go ahead and put this on here for now.

2337
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:50,180
Here's the Doki boy.

2338
01:13:54,410 --> 01:13:55,490
I think he's washing you.

2339
01:13:55,530 --> 01:13:56,230
It's only on my ear again.

2340
01:13:56,770 --> 01:13:56,870
Ah!

2341
01:13:57,650 --> 01:13:58,070
Ah!

2342
01:13:58,070 --> 01:13:58,130
Ah!

2343
01:13:58,130 --> 01:13:58,530
It's all right.

2344
01:13:59,070 --> 01:14:00,110
You'll be fine.

2345
01:14:02,710 --> 01:14:03,190
Ah!

2346
01:14:03,690 --> 01:14:04,070
Ah!

2347
01:14:04,290 --> 01:14:04,330
Ah!

2348
01:14:04,330 --> 01:14:04,530
Dammit!

2349
01:14:05,670 --> 01:14:07,330
Five-second rule for your ear.

2350
01:14:14,250 --> 01:14:14,890
All right.

2351
01:14:15,090 --> 01:14:16,110
So what's next, Tim?

2352
01:14:17,130 --> 01:14:17,610
So, one of the things...

2353
01:14:17,610 --> 01:14:20,890
Next, and now we're finally going to plate with our...

2354
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:21,030
Whoa!

2355
01:14:22,190 --> 01:14:23,850
The bento box!

2356
01:14:24,050 --> 01:14:24,130
Cute!

2357
01:14:24,130 --> 01:14:24,210
Yeah!

2358
01:14:24,530 --> 01:14:25,110
Bento box.

2359
01:14:27,390 --> 01:14:27,870
Stokey...

2360
01:14:28,450 --> 01:14:28,930
Yeah!

2361
01:14:29,390 --> 01:14:30,790
That's upside down, by the way.

2362
01:14:31,590 --> 01:14:32,310
There you go.

2363
01:14:32,490 --> 01:14:33,290
Yeah, there we go!

2364
01:14:33,950 --> 01:14:34,650
Yeah, see?

2365
01:14:35,030 --> 01:14:37,330
You can also get the bento box, chat!

2366
01:14:37,750 --> 01:14:38,570
See you, Dragoons!

2367
01:14:38,770 --> 01:14:39,850
It's you guys!

2368
01:14:40,990 --> 01:14:42,550
We'll put shit in your head.

2369
01:14:47,580 --> 01:14:49,360
Where did I...

2370
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:50,680
Where did I...

2371
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:50,940
I...

2372
01:14:50,940 --> 01:14:51,400
Uh...

2373
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:51,540
Okay.

2374
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:53,160
So, what we're gonna do is...

2375
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:55,900
We're gonna go ahead and plate the Hainane chicken rice first.

2376
01:14:56,060 --> 01:14:56,320
Uh-huh.

2377
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:57,560
So here, we have our rice.

2378
01:14:57,880 --> 01:14:58,060
Yeah.

2379
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:01,120
And, uh...

2380
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:02,020
So, rice.

2381
01:15:02,180 --> 01:15:02,980
And we're just gonna...

2382
01:15:02,980 --> 01:15:04,920
I'm just gonna put it off to the side over here.

2383
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:05,120
Wait, that looks good.

2384
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:06,920
That's a good-ass bowl of rice.

2385
01:15:07,340 --> 01:15:07,500
Right?

2386
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:07,740
Yeah.

2387
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:10,940
Oh my god, that smells so good.

2388
01:15:11,620 --> 01:15:11,920
Yes, you...

2389
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:12,920
I'm sorry, you guys can't smell it.

2390
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,100
We need... we need smell-o-vision.

2391
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:15,500
Yeah, we need smell-o-vision.

2392
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:16,500
Hey guys, can we...

2393
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:16,720
Can we...

2394
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:18,140
Can we have the smell-o-vision?

2395
01:15:18,460 --> 01:15:19,180
At Grok!

2396
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:19,760
Can we like...

2397
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:21,540
When do we have smell-o-vision?

2398
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:25,660
If you can put lingerie on Grok, we can have smell-o-vision.

2399
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:30,740
If we can put lingerie on Grok, we can have smell-o-vision.

2400
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:31,740
Crazy!

2401
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,560
That's crazy, Duncan.

2402
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:40,640
We're erasing our resources right now.

2403
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:46,380
For these kind of things, in order to debone it, the nice thing is...

2404
01:15:46,380 --> 01:15:46,700
After you...

2405
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:49,660
So, one of the fun things about microwaving, actually, is that...

2406
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:53,740
Because of how the microwaves work, look how easy this is to take off the bone.

2407
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:54,520
Oh!

2408
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:56,940
Oh my gosh, you're so smooth!

2409
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:57,680
Yeah?

2410
01:15:58,140 --> 01:15:58,280
Yeah!

2411
01:15:58,600 --> 01:15:58,760
Right?

2412
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:00,300
And so we can just...

2413
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:01,340
Right there.

2414
01:16:01,340 --> 01:16:02,280
Uh-huh.

2415
01:16:02,660 --> 01:16:04,040
And the chicken...

2416
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:04,280
You know what?

2417
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:06,800
The chicken lug we're gonna stick in just as is.

2418
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:08,680
Nice and easy.

2419
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:09,360
And then...

2420
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:12,700
You know, for the other one, we're gonna have a...

2421
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:15,560
So, for this one, we're gonna have a nice mug dessert.

2422
01:16:16,220 --> 01:16:16,580
Oh!

2423
01:16:16,580 --> 01:16:17,380
For the other one...

2424
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:21,840
And let's get some fresh...

2425
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:23,780
Let's get some fresh green onion in there.

2426
01:16:23,780 --> 01:16:24,340
Yeah.

2427
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,160
Let him go with the Doki blade, guys.

2428
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:27,700
Whoa!

2429
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:30,920
Look at that guy go!

2430
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:33,500
Ooh!

2431
01:16:33,820 --> 01:16:34,420
Look at that!

2432
01:16:34,540 --> 01:16:35,280
So fast!

2433
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:36,140
And so sharp!

2434
01:16:36,140 --> 01:16:36,880
A little bit on top.

2435
01:16:38,180 --> 01:16:42,860
If you cut at a bias like that, then it looks like these little needles, and it looks way fancier.

2436
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:43,480
Ooh!

2437
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:46,620
And then you charge, like, ten dollars more.

2438
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:48,120
Hell yeah!

2439
01:16:48,220 --> 01:16:49,040
That's what you do.

2440
01:16:49,380 --> 01:16:50,700
It's like how they put these, like...

2441
01:16:50,700 --> 01:16:51,040
Yeah, the knife skills.

2442
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:57,440
Those sauces on the plate, for decoration, and then they charge thirty dollars more because it looks a little prettier.

2443
01:16:58,900 --> 01:16:59,920
That's how they do it.

2444
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:00,140
Alright, Doki.

2445
01:17:01,060 --> 01:17:02,940
Do we put this whole giant tomato there?

2446
01:17:03,540 --> 01:17:03,940
Yes.

2447
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:06,960
Wait, would it look nice, though?

2448
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:09,920
Actually, yeah, actually.

2449
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:10,740
Oh yeah, it does!

2450
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:11,540
Look at that!

2451
01:17:11,540 --> 01:17:11,940
Look at that!

2452
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:15,080
I think it's gonna be squished a little bit when we actually close the lid.

2453
01:17:15,260 --> 01:17:15,320
Yeah.

2454
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:16,340
Oh my god!

2455
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:19,860
Look how fancy those shallots are.

2456
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:23,360
Look at how fancy that is.

2457
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:24,240
Oh yeah, that's also good.

2458
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:26,980
And then, uh, and then, uh, we, we wanna be healthy.

2459
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:27,740
Uh-huh.

2460
01:17:27,740 --> 01:17:29,700
So, a single kale chip.

2461
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:30,500
Ooh!

2462
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:31,620
Just one.

2463
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:33,320
Eat your veggies.

2464
01:17:34,620 --> 01:17:36,440
Eat your singular veggie, guys.

2465
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:38,200
The singular veggie.

2466
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:38,540
Yeah.

2467
01:17:38,540 --> 01:17:40,320
And, of course, we have our infused oil.

2468
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:42,040
So, I'm gonna go ahead and...

2469
01:17:42,740 --> 01:17:43,000
Ooh!

2470
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:44,700
That's the, the thing for the chicken.

2471
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:45,940
Yep.

2472
01:17:46,420 --> 01:17:46,900
Shallots.

2473
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:48,720
Green onion.

2474
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:51,080
Yeah, guys, you don't wanna be too healthy.

2475
01:17:51,340 --> 01:17:51,400
Oh man, that looks good.

2476
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:52,320
That's so true, chat.

2477
01:17:53,220 --> 01:17:53,580
True!

2478
01:17:53,980 --> 01:17:55,180
If you turn, if you eat too much...

2479
01:17:55,180 --> 01:17:55,640
If you're too healthy, you get...

2480
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:56,480
Yeah?

2481
01:17:56,820 --> 01:17:57,480
You get what?

2482
01:17:57,660 --> 01:18:00,160
If, if you're, if you're too healthy, you get stressed out.

2483
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:01,500
Because you don't eat good food.

2484
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:05,180
And, you know what they say, stress is, stress is the biggest killer.

2485
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:06,520
So, you gotta eat...

2486
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:06,640
That's true.

2487
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:07,060
You gotta...

2488
01:18:07,060 --> 01:18:08,180
You gotta...

2489
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:14,200
Why be too healthy when you can just eat McDonald's chicken nuggies like what Tim does?

2490
01:18:15,580 --> 01:18:16,800
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2491
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:17,140
Wait, wait, wait.

2492
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:19,600
I don't know, I don't know if that's what we were talking about.

2493
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:25,020
And then, and...

2494
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:25,260
Ta-da!

2495
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:25,920
Look at that.

2496
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:26,980
This nice...

2497
01:18:26,980 --> 01:18:27,000
Wow!

2498
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:29,520
Oh, yeah.

2499
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:30,700
And then our mug cake.

2500
01:18:30,820 --> 01:18:31,280
Ah, that's hot.

2501
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:31,720
Ah!

2502
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:32,260
Ah!

2503
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:33,400
Look at that.

2504
01:18:33,660 --> 01:18:35,660
And a nice mug cake for dessert.

2505
01:18:36,180 --> 01:18:38,720
But, we'll go ahead and scoop that out and then we'll...

2506
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:39,120
Yeah.

2507
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:45,660
I, I significantly overestimated how much space this mug cake would take.

2508
01:18:45,700 --> 01:18:46,700
So, we'll, we'll have a little bite.

2509
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:47,680
We'll have a little bite in there.

2510
01:18:47,860 --> 01:18:49,600
I can't, I can barely see the cake.

2511
01:18:49,780 --> 01:18:50,460
Where is it?

2512
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:52,740
You can barely see the cake.

2513
01:18:52,940 --> 01:18:53,220
Whoa!

2514
01:18:53,260 --> 01:18:53,880
What do you say?

2515
01:18:54,060 --> 01:18:56,100
I do a lot of squats and deadlifts, okay?

2516
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:58,120
Like, I just have Asian genetics.

2517
01:18:58,300 --> 01:18:59,260
That's why you can't see the cake as much.

2518
01:18:59,260 --> 01:19:00,680
Clearly, I think you didn't do enough.

2519
01:19:00,980 --> 01:19:01,620
Sorry, Tim.

2520
01:19:01,940 --> 01:19:02,420
It's the truth.

2521
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:05,700
Look at, look, look at that.

2522
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:06,900
Look at that moist cake.

2523
01:19:07,140 --> 01:19:07,380
Ooh!

2524
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:08,140
Yes!

2525
01:19:08,420 --> 01:19:08,800
Look at that.

2526
01:19:09,220 --> 01:19:09,640
Ooh!

2527
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:12,180
Eat it!

2528
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:12,540
Ooh!

2529
01:19:13,380 --> 01:19:13,540
Ooh!

2530
01:19:13,780 --> 01:19:13,920
Ha!

2531
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:17,420
Oh, man, that's good.

2532
01:19:18,540 --> 01:19:18,700
Ooh!

2533
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:19,380
Oh!

2534
01:19:19,580 --> 01:19:19,820
Leo!

2535
01:19:20,860 --> 01:19:21,660
Redemption art!

2536
01:19:22,940 --> 01:19:23,580
Redemption art!

2537
01:19:23,580 --> 01:19:23,660
The what?

2538
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:24,640
Redemption art?

2539
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:26,440
You're gonna throw cake at him?

2540
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:27,600
Yeah.

2541
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:28,740
Leo, if he...

2542
01:19:28,740 --> 01:19:30,760
Blink twice if you wanna...

2543
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:30,940
All right.

2544
01:19:30,940 --> 01:19:32,300
If he's abusing you.

2545
01:19:33,380 --> 01:19:34,600
Three, two, one.

2546
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:35,220
Oh!

2547
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:37,300
Oh!

2548
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:38,600
Oh!

2549
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:40,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2550
01:19:40,060 --> 01:19:40,420
Come back here.

2551
01:19:40,540 --> 01:19:40,940
Come back here.

2552
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:41,340
One more.

2553
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:42,360
Oh!

2554
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:44,340
Oh!

2555
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,500
Leo was ready for that!

2556
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:47,400
Whoa!

2557
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:51,420
And so we're just gonna put...

2558
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:53,160
Yeah, that was a bad throw.

2559
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:53,400
Yeah, that was a bad throw.

2560
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:54,180
That wasn't on Leo.

2561
01:19:54,340 --> 01:19:55,220
You're so right, Chad.

2562
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:56,340
Yeah, it's true.

2563
01:19:56,380 --> 01:19:56,600
It's true.

2564
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:57,260
That wasn't on him.

2565
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:01,020
There we go.

2566
01:20:01,420 --> 01:20:01,680
Ta-da!

2567
01:20:02,020 --> 01:20:02,640
Zoom, zoom!

2568
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:04,040
Zoom!

2569
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:05,980
I wanna see!

2570
01:20:07,100 --> 01:20:07,900
Close-up!

2571
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:08,820
Camera five!

2572
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:10,000
You want, uh...

2573
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,300
Wait, I need a better close-up.

2574
01:20:11,900 --> 01:20:12,080
Camera five!

2575
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:12,720
Camera five!

2576
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:14,380
Give me that close-up!

2577
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:16,300
Camera two!

2578
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:17,340
I also...

2579
01:20:17,340 --> 01:20:17,860
Camera four?

2580
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:18,360
Camera four?

2581
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:19,120
Camera four!

2582
01:20:19,620 --> 01:20:20,460
Oh, look at that.

2583
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:21,960
Oh!

2584
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:25,420
The shallots look like a little tomato thing!

2585
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:26,860
Oh, that's cute!

2586
01:20:27,780 --> 01:20:28,540
That's cute, guys.

2587
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:29,360
That looks good.

2588
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:31,980
That looks some good-ass chicken right there.

2589
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:32,680
Where's the metal container in this?

2590
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:34,860
I think there's another one over there.

2591
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,020
Where did the metal container go?

2592
01:20:36,940 --> 01:20:37,640
It's all the way.

2593
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:38,460
We got...

2594
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:39,660
We saw...

2595
01:20:39,660 --> 01:20:41,080
We got enough close-up.

2596
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:42,740
All right, what's the second bento?

2597
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:45,860
And then, now, our second bento is...

2598
01:20:47,140 --> 01:20:48,140
Camera three!

2599
01:20:49,060 --> 01:20:50,260
Second bento tab.

2600
01:20:50,620 --> 01:20:50,720
This is...

2601
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:52,840
This is our, uh, clam chowder.

2602
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:55,660
Oh!

2603
01:20:57,480 --> 01:20:58,020
Ooh!

2604
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:00,660
Look at how fresh that clam chowder is!

2605
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:02,400
It's got bacon.

2606
01:21:03,580 --> 01:21:04,120
Right?

2607
01:21:04,420 --> 01:21:04,740
Mm-hmm.

2608
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:05,340
And then...

2609
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:07,460
We got our tomato rice.

2610
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:08,760
Ooh!

2611
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:09,300
On the side.

2612
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:10,120
That'll soak it up.

2613
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:15,100
And this tomato provides a nice little acidity in order to cut through all that cream and fat.

2614
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:15,880
Yeah?

2615
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:20,340
I was gonna do noodles, but people are weirded out by noodles and cream for some reason.

2616
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:23,320
Wait, you can make noodles in a microwave?

2617
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:24,660
Yup!

2618
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:27,120
You want me to do that right now?

2619
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:30,340
Wait, do we have the thing for that?

2620
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:31,860
Yeah!

2621
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:34,280
Uh, can you grab me a...

2622
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:35,600
Uh, I had noodles over there.

2623
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:36,120
Oh.

2624
01:21:36,340 --> 01:21:37,340
Wait, how do you make noodles?

2625
01:21:37,580 --> 01:21:38,540
Like, cup noodles?

2626
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:39,980
Or, like, actual noodles?

2627
01:21:39,980 --> 01:21:40,640
Nope, you can make any...

2628
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:41,880
Yeah, you can make any noodles.

2629
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:42,260
Wait.

2630
01:21:42,260 --> 01:21:43,540
In fact, what we're gonna do is...

2631
01:21:44,780 --> 01:21:45,100
Wait.

2632
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:45,820
How long does it take?

2633
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:46,340
We're gonna...

2634
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:49,280
Uh...

2635
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:50,680
We're gonna make Vite Ramen noodles.

2636
01:21:51,860 --> 01:21:52,180
Oh!

2637
01:21:52,180 --> 01:21:54,640
But I didn't get the branded one, because this is my personal statue.

2638
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:56,200
You can make any kind of...

2639
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:58,460
You can make any kind of noodle, and it's the same thing, right?

2640
01:21:58,460 --> 01:22:01,340
This is how you know Doki has never struggled.

2641
01:22:01,860 --> 01:22:05,980
Okay, I just get a kettle and pour hot water in the noodle.

2642
01:22:06,580 --> 01:22:06,880
I...

2643
01:22:08,780 --> 01:22:09,880
I never...

2644
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:10,360
We got the water in?

2645
01:22:10,420 --> 01:22:11,880
I had a kettle, guys.

2646
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:18,900
All you gotta do, water, noodles, microwave.

2647
01:22:19,300 --> 01:22:22,300
We go three minutes, and then afterwards, we're gonna give it a flip.

2648
01:22:22,620 --> 01:22:24,280
And then, uh, and then that'll be good.

2649
01:22:24,660 --> 01:22:26,140
Oh, I see.

2650
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:27,440
Yup.

2651
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:30,780
A kettle, ooh la la, so fancy Doki.

2652
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:35,820
A microwave is more expensive than a fucking kettle.

2653
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:42,760
La-dee-da, this fancy.

2654
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:47,280
Alright.

2655
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:48,020
We got a salmon.

2656
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:49,100
Yeah.

2657
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:49,800
We got...

2658
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:52,300
We gotta get a little tomato there, obviously.

2659
01:22:52,940 --> 01:22:53,860
A little...

2660
01:22:53,860 --> 01:22:54,940
That cuts the acidity.

2661
01:22:55,180 --> 01:22:58,140
We'll go with some more green onions, because green onions are good on everything.

2662
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:05,790
We gotta do the fancy cut again.

2663
01:23:06,170 --> 01:23:06,250
Oh!

2664
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:07,050
A fancy way!

2665
01:23:07,610 --> 01:23:08,690
Look at him go!

2666
01:23:09,310 --> 01:23:09,750
Right?

2667
01:23:10,990 --> 01:23:12,270
I'm gonna put that...

2668
01:23:12,270 --> 01:23:13,310
right on the rice over here.

2669
01:23:13,790 --> 01:23:14,510
But wait!

2670
01:23:14,970 --> 01:23:16,010
We wanna make it cuter!

2671
01:23:16,070 --> 01:23:16,350
Wait, there's more!

2672
01:23:16,910 --> 01:23:17,390
You're right!

2673
01:23:17,390 --> 01:23:17,770
Oh wait!

2674
01:23:17,930 --> 01:23:18,290
There's more!

2675
01:23:19,030 --> 01:23:20,170
And so...

2676
01:23:20,170 --> 01:23:23,090
We are...

2677
01:23:23,090 --> 01:23:24,870
Where the hell did those go?

2678
01:23:25,590 --> 01:23:26,530
Oh!

2679
01:23:28,110 --> 01:23:29,790
And so...

2680
01:23:29,790 --> 01:23:30,770
This...

2681
01:23:30,770 --> 01:23:32,190
is how you make...

2682
01:23:32,190 --> 01:23:33,330
the bento apple bunny.

2683
01:23:33,870 --> 01:23:34,390
Oh!

2684
01:23:35,110 --> 01:23:36,310
Teach us!

2685
01:23:38,850 --> 01:23:39,650
First of all...

2686
01:23:39,650 --> 01:23:40,070
Clear your board.

2687
01:23:40,450 --> 01:23:40,690
A little bit.

2688
01:23:41,190 --> 01:23:41,350
Yeah.

2689
01:23:42,850 --> 01:23:43,370
Then you cut.

2690
01:23:43,770 --> 01:23:44,410
Down the middle.

2691
01:23:44,890 --> 01:23:45,230
Whoa!

2692
01:23:45,710 --> 01:23:46,250
So fast!

2693
01:23:46,490 --> 01:23:47,030
Down the middle again.

2694
01:23:51,330 --> 01:23:52,050
And then...

2695
01:23:52,050 --> 01:23:53,630
With these...

2696
01:23:53,630 --> 01:23:54,230
So...

2697
01:23:54,230 --> 01:23:56,010
One of the easiest ways to do it in order to...

2698
01:23:56,010 --> 01:23:56,430
First of all...

2699
01:23:56,430 --> 01:23:56,450
Yeah.

2700
01:23:56,450 --> 01:23:57,130
You wanna core it.

2701
01:23:57,290 --> 01:23:57,870
So you can...

2702
01:23:57,870 --> 01:23:59,990
So you can do something like this in order to core it.

2703
01:24:00,510 --> 01:24:00,730
Yeah.

2704
01:24:01,010 --> 01:24:02,370
You can choke up on the blade over here.

2705
01:24:02,650 --> 01:24:03,090
Fun fact!

2706
01:24:03,090 --> 01:24:03,630
Actually...

2707
01:24:03,630 --> 01:24:05,510
The iron sights actually help with this.

2708
01:24:05,850 --> 01:24:06,290
Because...

2709
01:24:06,290 --> 01:24:06,870
In...

2710
01:24:06,870 --> 01:24:07,830
In tactical knives.

2711
01:24:08,410 --> 01:24:09,050
When we...

2712
01:24:09,050 --> 01:24:10,010
When you have tactical knives.

2713
01:24:10,190 --> 01:24:12,310
You do actually have these kind of things over here.

2714
01:24:12,510 --> 01:24:13,570
So you can rip the...

2715
01:24:13,970 --> 01:24:16,350
You can rip someone's insides out better.

2716
01:24:16,910 --> 01:24:18,090
When you twist it, right?

2717
01:24:19,150 --> 01:24:19,590
No!

2718
01:24:20,090 --> 01:24:20,270
It's...

2719
01:24:20,270 --> 01:24:21,230
It's for...

2720
01:24:21,230 --> 01:24:21,750
It's...

2721
01:24:21,750 --> 01:24:22,810
So your hand doesn't slip.

2722
01:24:23,370 --> 01:24:23,750
Oh!

2723
01:24:23,950 --> 01:24:24,810
And so...

2724
01:24:24,810 --> 01:24:25,770
This not only...

2725
01:24:25,770 --> 01:24:26,910
That's what jacket knives do.

2726
01:24:27,170 --> 01:24:27,450
I forgot.

2727
01:24:28,030 --> 01:24:29,290
That's a jacket knife.

2728
01:24:29,450 --> 01:24:30,130
Okay, so you'll...

2729
01:24:30,130 --> 01:24:32,910
I guess technically if you put this in and then you pull it out, I don't know what that would do.

2730
01:24:33,150 --> 01:24:33,210
Yeah, because...

2731
01:24:33,210 --> 01:24:35,870
Yeah, you can just like rip the insides out a little bit more.

2732
01:24:36,250 --> 01:24:38,870
But that's also what jagged knives do too.

2733
01:24:39,490 --> 01:24:39,770
Yeah!

2734
01:24:40,370 --> 01:24:40,810
Yeah, anyway.

2735
01:24:41,150 --> 01:24:42,670
So don't ask how I know this, guys.

2736
01:24:42,850 --> 01:24:43,870
But anyway, so what do we...

2737
01:24:43,870 --> 01:24:44,390
So...

2738
01:24:44,390 --> 01:24:45,490
What do we do now?

2739
01:24:46,390 --> 01:24:49,070
Then we just cut it so it's flat on the surface over there.

2740
01:24:49,370 --> 01:24:51,530
And then you can choke up on the knife in order to make this easier.

2741
01:24:52,710 --> 01:24:53,430
You wanna...

2742
01:24:53,430 --> 01:24:54,490
And then you wanna...

2743
01:24:54,490 --> 01:24:56,730
What you can also do is you can cut that...

2744
01:24:56,730 --> 01:24:58,890
You can cut that flat in order to make it easier on yourself.

2745
01:24:59,150 --> 01:24:59,390
Yeah.

2746
01:25:01,410 --> 01:25:07,250
And then like this, because we're using a bigger knife, we're just gonna have to cut it a little shorter.

2747
01:25:07,410 --> 01:25:07,610
Yeah.

2748
01:25:08,070 --> 01:25:10,110
Just so it's easier to work with.

2749
01:25:12,970 --> 01:25:13,650
Oh my God.

2750
01:25:14,390 --> 01:25:15,030
I wanna close up, camera.

2751
01:25:15,030 --> 01:25:15,550
It is also...

2752
01:25:15,550 --> 01:25:15,850
I wanna close up, camera.

2753
01:25:16,150 --> 01:25:16,850
Camera three!

2754
01:25:17,230 --> 01:25:18,070
Give me a close up.

2755
01:25:18,850 --> 01:25:19,370
All right, nice.

2756
01:25:19,550 --> 01:25:19,870
Thank you.

2757
01:25:20,510 --> 01:25:20,830
Right?

2758
01:25:21,250 --> 01:25:21,330
Yeah.

2759
01:25:21,550 --> 01:25:23,310
And then we cut over here.

2760
01:25:23,310 --> 01:25:24,570
Oh, actually we...

2761
01:25:24,570 --> 01:25:26,610
So you first do a V cut over here.

2762
01:25:26,870 --> 01:25:26,950
Yeah.

2763
01:25:26,970 --> 01:25:27,310
Lightly.

2764
01:25:27,670 --> 01:25:28,110
Across.

2765
01:25:28,490 --> 01:25:28,870
So you score.

2766
01:25:29,290 --> 01:25:29,730
Boom.

2767
01:25:30,190 --> 01:25:31,070
And then boom.

2768
01:25:31,470 --> 01:25:31,890
Yeah.

2769
01:25:32,310 --> 01:25:34,210
And then you go in between...

2770
01:25:34,210 --> 01:25:36,270
And then you go underneath, just under the skin.

2771
01:25:36,730 --> 01:25:36,950
Ooh.

2772
01:25:38,190 --> 01:25:39,390
Guys taking notes, guys.

2773
01:25:42,230 --> 01:25:45,470
And what you wanna be careful of, especially if you're using a big blade, is...

2774
01:25:45,470 --> 01:25:50,410
It's very easy to go over here and you'll see that this will actually cut through over here instead of...

2775
01:25:50,410 --> 01:25:51,990
So you kinda gotta angle it.

2776
01:25:52,030 --> 01:25:52,290
Yeah.

2777
01:25:52,470 --> 01:25:53,350
Downwards as you're moving.

2778
01:25:54,190 --> 01:25:54,630
Slowly.

2779
01:25:54,810 --> 01:25:55,030
Slowly.

2780
01:25:55,310 --> 01:25:55,530
Slowly.

2781
01:25:55,910 --> 01:25:56,030
Slowly.

2782
01:25:56,870 --> 01:25:56,910
Slowly.

2783
01:25:59,370 --> 01:26:00,250
So fancy.

2784
01:26:01,330 --> 01:26:01,770
Angle.

2785
01:26:01,770 --> 01:26:01,910
Angle.

2786
01:26:02,710 --> 01:26:03,470
And then...

2787
01:26:03,470 --> 01:26:04,130
This pops off.

2788
01:26:05,130 --> 01:26:05,990
And it's a...

2789
01:26:05,990 --> 01:26:06,710
Oh no, I broke it!

2790
01:26:06,890 --> 01:26:07,630
I broke it!

2791
01:26:07,910 --> 01:26:08,730
No, never mind, I didn't.

2792
01:26:09,190 --> 01:26:09,750
It's fine.

2793
01:26:10,050 --> 01:26:10,410
And it's a bunny!

2794
01:26:11,370 --> 01:26:12,350
And it's a little bunny.

2795
01:26:12,830 --> 01:26:13,410
Look at that!

2796
01:26:13,410 --> 01:26:14,290
Don't ignore that.

2797
01:26:14,350 --> 01:26:15,810
It's Hollow Knight confirmed!

2798
01:26:19,770 --> 01:26:21,950
Guys, we're gonna get the sequel, guys.

2799
01:26:25,890 --> 01:26:27,790
Okay, yeah, and then you do that again.

2800
01:26:28,830 --> 01:26:29,750
Yeah, we're just gonna...

2801
01:26:29,750 --> 01:26:31,090
We're gonna make two because we don't want this...

2802
01:26:31,090 --> 01:26:32,450
We don't want this guy to be lonely, right?

2803
01:26:32,510 --> 01:26:33,750
This is unconfirmed, guys!

2804
01:26:34,190 --> 01:26:35,050
Look at that!

2805
01:26:40,570 --> 01:26:40,970
Alright.

2806
01:26:42,150 --> 01:26:43,510
And then we're just...

2807
01:26:43,510 --> 01:26:43,670
Ah!

2808
01:26:44,250 --> 01:26:44,510
What?

2809
01:26:45,170 --> 01:26:45,790
What happened?

2810
01:26:46,410 --> 01:26:47,630
Oh, you broke it!

2811
01:26:47,810 --> 01:26:48,750
Oh, you broke it!

2812
01:26:49,250 --> 01:26:50,130
No, no, no.

2813
01:26:50,270 --> 01:26:50,630
It just...

2814
01:26:50,630 --> 01:26:51,670
I just nearly cut myself.

2815
01:26:53,210 --> 01:26:55,090
Oh yeah, that's also equally bad.

2816
01:26:58,970 --> 01:27:00,170
Yeah, don't worry about it.

2817
01:27:00,970 --> 01:27:01,330
I...

2818
01:27:01,330 --> 01:27:01,810
I might have...

2819
01:27:01,810 --> 01:27:02,190
I...

2820
01:27:02,190 --> 01:27:03,110
Yeah, no, I messed this...

2821
01:27:03,110 --> 01:27:03,730
I mean...

2822
01:27:03,730 --> 01:27:04,310
No, never mind.

2823
01:27:04,390 --> 01:27:05,010
We have just this one.

2824
01:27:05,090 --> 01:27:05,530
This is perfect.

2825
01:27:05,750 --> 01:27:06,270
Look at that.

2826
01:27:06,530 --> 01:27:07,910
Look at that little guy.

2827
01:27:07,910 --> 01:27:08,050
Yeah.

2828
01:27:08,130 --> 01:27:08,750
Yeah, that's...

2829
01:27:08,750 --> 01:27:10,870
This man is bleeding on our bento.

2830
01:27:11,550 --> 01:27:11,990
No, that's...

2831
01:27:11,990 --> 01:27:12,890
No, that's...

2832
01:27:13,670 --> 01:27:14,930
How dare he!

2833
01:27:15,730 --> 01:27:16,010
Hey, hey!

2834
01:27:16,010 --> 01:27:17,210
That's new expensive stuff, okay?

2835
01:27:17,630 --> 01:27:18,070
That's...

2836
01:27:18,070 --> 01:27:19,310
That's the flavor.

2837
01:27:20,270 --> 01:27:20,930
Extra flavor.

2838
01:27:21,130 --> 01:27:21,310
Ow!

2839
01:27:21,450 --> 01:27:21,870
That's hot.

2840
01:27:22,150 --> 01:27:22,530
Ow!

2841
01:27:22,630 --> 01:27:23,010
That's hot.

2842
01:27:23,450 --> 01:27:24,030
So yeah.

2843
01:27:25,310 --> 01:27:26,030
That, right?

2844
01:27:27,830 --> 01:27:30,130
Then the noodles in the microwave, and then you get...

2845
01:27:30,230 --> 01:27:32,830
You know, you stir them around a little bit, and then you microwave it until it's done.

2846
01:27:33,050 --> 01:27:33,130
Uh-huh.

2847
01:27:33,470 --> 01:27:34,090
Until you're...

2848
01:27:34,090 --> 01:27:35,130
To how...

2849
01:27:35,130 --> 01:27:36,390
How done you like it.

2850
01:27:36,810 --> 01:27:37,250
Easy.

2851
01:27:37,910 --> 01:27:39,490
I do another three minutes, personally.

2852
01:27:40,070 --> 01:27:41,610
I like making noodles softer.

2853
01:27:41,890 --> 01:27:42,310
Uh-huh.

2854
01:27:42,310 --> 01:27:42,530
Yeah.

2855
01:27:42,850 --> 01:27:43,530
Otherwise...

2856
01:27:43,530 --> 01:27:44,090
Voila.

2857
01:27:44,790 --> 01:27:45,690
Camera two!

2858
01:27:45,690 --> 01:27:46,630
Here is a...

2859
01:27:47,950 --> 01:27:48,930
Close-up.

2860
01:27:50,270 --> 01:27:52,230
Here is a...

2861
01:27:52,230 --> 01:27:52,350
Here is a...

2862
01:27:52,350 --> 01:27:53,470
Western...

2863
01:27:53,470 --> 01:27:54,490
Um...

2864
01:27:54,490 --> 01:27:55,550
Here's a Western...

2865
01:27:57,010 --> 01:27:57,690
Uh...

2866
01:27:57,690 --> 01:27:58,670
Style...

2867
01:27:58,670 --> 01:28:00,090
Bento-ish...

2868
01:28:00,090 --> 01:28:01,090
With a...

2869
01:28:01,090 --> 01:28:02,070
With a...

2870
01:28:02,070 --> 01:28:02,470
With a clam chowder.

2871
01:28:03,130 --> 01:28:03,810
Um...

2872
01:28:03,810 --> 01:28:04,170
Uh...

2873
01:28:04,170 --> 01:28:04,630
Clam chowder.

2874
01:28:04,790 --> 01:28:06,090
Corp bullion poached lobster.

2875
01:28:06,930 --> 01:28:07,370
Oh!

2876
01:28:07,370 --> 01:28:07,670
Oh!

2877
01:28:07,670 --> 01:28:07,850
Oh!

2878
01:28:07,850 --> 01:28:08,490
Salmon...

2879
01:28:09,970 --> 01:28:10,610
Uh...

2880
01:28:10,610 --> 01:28:11,150
Um...

2881
01:28:11,150 --> 01:28:11,690
What do you call it?

2882
01:28:11,790 --> 01:28:12,330
Fusion...

2883
01:28:12,330 --> 01:28:13,030
Fusion salmon.

2884
01:28:13,230 --> 01:28:13,850
Apple bunny.

2885
01:28:14,830 --> 01:28:15,470
Um...

2886
01:28:15,470 --> 01:28:16,230
Apple...

2887
01:28:16,230 --> 01:28:16,610
Or...

2888
01:28:16,610 --> 01:28:17,270
Tomato rice.

2889
01:28:18,570 --> 01:28:19,210
Uh...

2890
01:28:19,210 --> 01:28:19,670
Yeah.

2891
01:28:20,010 --> 01:28:21,810
A clam chowder bento, guys.

2892
01:28:21,810 --> 01:28:22,730
There's so much in there!

2893
01:28:25,310 --> 01:28:26,250
Oh my god.

2894
01:28:26,470 --> 01:28:26,630
Wait.

2895
01:28:27,690 --> 01:28:28,330
That's it?

2896
01:28:28,490 --> 01:28:29,050
That was it?

2897
01:28:29,910 --> 01:28:30,310
Yup.

2898
01:28:30,690 --> 01:28:31,290
Oh my god.

2899
01:28:31,370 --> 01:28:32,090
And that is...

2900
01:28:32,090 --> 01:28:40,850
Look at all the stuff that we can make with microwaves and the doki blade, the doki board, put in bentos, and you can take that to work and take that to school.

2901
01:28:41,050 --> 01:28:41,390
Yeah!

2902
01:28:42,330 --> 01:28:43,130
Guys, and he made...

2903
01:28:43,130 --> 01:28:43,970
And eat it with your doki chopsticks.

2904
01:28:44,170 --> 01:28:47,430
He made all of that within an hour and 30 minutes.

2905
01:28:47,850 --> 01:28:48,650
Wait, that's crazy.

2906
01:28:48,650 --> 01:28:50,450
He made so much stuff.

2907
01:28:50,970 --> 01:28:53,370
Look at all the shit he made, guys.

2908
01:28:53,650 --> 01:28:54,710
With 10...

2909
01:28:54,710 --> 01:28:57,970
Guys, all we need is just 10 microwaves.

2910
01:28:58,050 --> 01:28:59,170
Is that easy, chat?

2911
01:28:59,930 --> 01:29:00,630
It's true.

2912
01:29:03,010 --> 01:29:04,230
That's all you need.

2913
01:29:05,230 --> 01:29:07,450
Which one do you want me to try first?

2914
01:29:07,850 --> 01:29:09,450
I want you to try...

2915
01:29:09,450 --> 01:29:11,930
Try the chicken first.

2916
01:29:12,530 --> 01:29:13,450
Try the chicken?

2917
01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:14,110
Yeah.

2918
01:29:15,590 --> 01:29:17,930
I was gonna eat it with the knife and then I was like...

2919
01:29:17,930 --> 01:29:18,930
No, that's not safe.

2920
01:29:19,110 --> 01:29:19,550
That's not...

2921
01:29:19,550 --> 01:29:20,990
Even I wouldn't recommend that.

2922
01:29:22,130 --> 01:29:23,010
Wouldn't recommend what?

2923
01:29:23,110 --> 01:29:23,530
Eating the chicken?

2924
01:29:23,850 --> 01:29:25,370
No, eating it with the knife.

2925
01:29:26,550 --> 01:29:27,230
Oh, well, okay.

2926
01:29:27,530 --> 01:29:28,490
Now I have to eat it with the knife.

2927
01:29:28,650 --> 01:29:29,570
Don't do it!

2928
01:29:30,050 --> 01:29:30,490
Tim!

2929
01:29:31,430 --> 01:29:32,710
It's so sharp!

2930
01:29:33,110 --> 01:29:34,110
Oh, my God.

2931
01:29:34,150 --> 01:29:35,730
You're fucking crazy.

2932
01:29:36,530 --> 01:29:37,550
Oh, my God.

2933
01:29:37,650 --> 01:29:40,230
This is something even I couldn't even endorse, guys.

2934
01:29:40,610 --> 01:29:41,230
Oh, my God.

2935
01:29:41,330 --> 01:29:42,270
Guys, don't do this at home.

2936
01:29:42,410 --> 01:29:42,970
This guy is...

2937
01:29:42,970 --> 01:29:44,330
This guy is not okay.

2938
01:29:46,890 --> 01:29:49,530
Look, you can just cut into that tomato.

2939
01:29:49,730 --> 01:29:50,390
Scoop it.

2940
01:29:50,670 --> 01:29:52,030
Guys, oh, my God.

2941
01:29:52,270 --> 01:29:53,490
Oh, my God.

2942
01:29:54,670 --> 01:29:55,150
Maniac.

2943
01:29:57,510 --> 01:29:58,470
I guess...

2944
01:29:58,470 --> 01:30:00,150
Guys, don't do this at home.

2945
01:30:01,330 --> 01:30:02,470
Don't do this at home.

2946
01:30:02,590 --> 01:30:03,310
He's a CEO.

2947
01:30:06,690 --> 01:30:09,290
You know how them CEOs are like, guys.

2948
01:30:10,410 --> 01:30:11,450
Hey, other CEOs.

2949
01:30:11,630 --> 01:30:12,590
I want to see you do this, okay?

2950
01:30:13,990 --> 01:30:14,790
You might...

2951
01:30:14,790 --> 01:30:14,950
You know?

2952
01:30:15,110 --> 01:30:15,550
Just saying.

2953
01:30:15,930 --> 01:30:16,350
It's a kill issue.

2954
01:30:17,890 --> 01:30:19,070
The world might be a better place.

2955
01:30:19,650 --> 01:30:20,050
Yeah.

2956
01:30:21,850 --> 01:30:22,250
Oh!

2957
01:30:22,630 --> 01:30:23,870
The fries are so good!

2958
01:30:24,070 --> 01:30:24,270
Guys...

2959
01:30:24,270 --> 01:30:24,390
Wait.

2960
01:30:24,950 --> 01:30:26,450
It's because of the MSG.

2961
01:30:27,290 --> 01:30:27,690
Mmm.

2962
01:30:28,010 --> 01:30:29,310
Wait, is the rice really good?

2963
01:30:30,890 --> 01:30:32,410
Yeah, this is the high-line chicken rice.

2964
01:30:32,650 --> 01:30:33,990
That we made with the...

2965
01:30:33,990 --> 01:30:35,230
With microwave, guys.

2966
01:30:36,530 --> 01:30:36,930
Yeah.

2967
01:30:38,170 --> 01:30:39,210
And with the stock.

2968
01:30:39,610 --> 01:30:39,970
Oh, man.

2969
01:30:41,490 --> 01:30:42,770
Doki, you need to try making this.

2970
01:30:42,990 --> 01:30:43,950
Oh, my God.

2971
01:30:44,370 --> 01:30:46,290
The first thing I do, I was gonna make that rice.

2972
01:30:46,930 --> 01:30:48,350
The microwave rice.

2973
01:30:50,250 --> 01:30:51,190
Someone, like...

2974
01:30:51,190 --> 01:30:51,250
All right.

2975
01:30:51,490 --> 01:30:52,350
Someone sent...

2976
01:30:52,350 --> 01:30:55,350
Someone tried to buy me a rice cooker.

2977
01:30:56,570 --> 01:30:59,590
But then, like, on the Throne website thing.

2978
01:31:00,070 --> 01:31:02,270
But then, like, Throne was stopped him.

2979
01:31:03,010 --> 01:31:04,170
So, thank God.

2980
01:31:04,170 --> 01:31:07,070
So, now, I can just never have a rice cooker again.

2981
01:31:07,250 --> 01:31:08,390
I can just use a microwave.

2982
01:31:09,850 --> 01:31:10,430
All right.

2983
01:31:10,970 --> 01:31:11,290
It's okay.

2984
01:31:11,450 --> 01:31:12,350
I'm gonna send you...

2985
01:31:12,350 --> 01:31:13,630
I'm gonna send you a rice cooker.

2986
01:31:13,810 --> 01:31:13,970
I...

2987
01:31:13,970 --> 01:31:14,510
I can't...

2988
01:31:14,510 --> 01:31:14,890
Wait.

2989
01:31:14,950 --> 01:31:16,430
I can't believe that you don't have rice cooker.

2990
01:31:16,590 --> 01:31:17,310
Wait, but why?

2991
01:31:17,490 --> 01:31:19,350
Why wouldn't I have a microwave?

2992
01:31:19,710 --> 01:31:21,530
The microwave can do everything.

2993
01:31:23,510 --> 01:31:23,910
It's...

2994
01:31:24,930 --> 01:31:25,330
It's...

2995
01:31:25,330 --> 01:31:25,370
It's...

2996
01:31:25,370 --> 01:31:25,510
It's...

2997
01:31:25,510 --> 01:31:26,610
It's the principle of it.

2998
01:31:26,610 --> 01:31:26,650
Okay?

2999
01:31:26,670 --> 01:31:29,770
Even Throne didn't want me to have a rice cooker.

3000
01:31:29,930 --> 01:31:31,110
They stopped him.

3001
01:31:31,670 --> 01:31:33,670
They were, like, something...

3002
01:31:33,670 --> 01:31:34,510
Why did they stop it?

3003
01:31:34,770 --> 01:31:46,410
Because Throne was like, there's something wrong because there's a price difference, apparently, from Canadian, apparently Canadian rice cookers were more expensive than like wherever country that guy tried to buy it from.

3004
01:31:47,670 --> 01:31:53,570
So they're like, we need you to pay to pay the extra cost so we can send this rice cooker to you.

3005
01:31:53,790 --> 01:31:55,710
And then I was like, hmm.

3006
01:31:55,710 --> 01:31:55,930
Hmm.

3007
01:32:02,820 --> 01:32:03,260
Okay.

3008
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:04,360
As I am.

3009
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:06,240
I'll send you like the tiniest rice cooker.

3010
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:08,240
So now I don't need a rice cooker.

3011
01:32:08,420 --> 01:32:10,680
I have the mic... you prove your point.

3012
01:32:11,020 --> 01:32:11,720
No, it's okay.

3013
01:32:11,820 --> 01:32:14,440
You prove your point that microwaves are better.

3014
01:32:15,820 --> 01:32:19,260
I actually think the microwave cooks rice faster than the rice cooker.

3015
01:32:19,340 --> 01:32:20,700
I'm not even...

3016
01:32:20,700 --> 01:32:21,480
See?

3017
01:32:21,820 --> 01:32:25,240
It does like at least 20 minutes in the rice cooker and it's like 12 minutes with the microwave.

3018
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:29,160
That's half the time and it tastes just as good.

3019
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:30,620
I've been enlightened.

3020
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:32,560
I've...

3021
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:39,300
See, guys, 12 minutes in the microwave and all you need is rice and water.

3022
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:43,620
Faster but not better.

3023
01:32:43,940 --> 01:32:46,320
This man was a Michelin chef.

3024
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:49,200
He endorsed microwave rice cooking.

3025
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:51,580
You know what?

3026
01:32:51,740 --> 01:32:54,200
If you don't think it's better, come find me.

3027
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:55,340
Yeah.

3028
01:32:55,640 --> 01:32:56,480
What's your address?

3029
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:57,200
Let's go.

3030
01:32:57,900 --> 01:32:58,160
Let's go.

3031
01:32:58,160 --> 01:32:58,480
Let's go.

3032
01:33:00,540 --> 01:33:01,820
Yeah, fight him, Ira.

3033
01:33:01,820 --> 01:33:02,800
It's on the Byte Ramen packets.

3034
01:33:04,940 --> 01:33:06,160
It's on the Byte Ramen packets.

3035
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:10,060
So you're gonna have to buy her stuff and then once it gets there, then you have the address.

3036
01:33:10,180 --> 01:33:16,540
For legal reasons, do not travel to the Byte Ramen headquarters to fight an Asian man.

3037
01:33:16,540 --> 01:33:18,420
Do not do that.

3038
01:33:20,640 --> 01:33:27,280
But if Tim tweets that out on his own social media account, I can't stop you.

3039
01:33:28,140 --> 01:33:33,100
But if it's on my channel for legal reasons, that is a joke.

3040
01:33:33,660 --> 01:33:34,440
Do not...

3041
01:33:35,260 --> 01:33:38,680
Do not find where the headquarters are.

3042
01:33:40,140 --> 01:33:43,040
I mean, it's like public information, technically.

3043
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:44,340
I'm not there all the time, though.

3044
01:33:44,600 --> 01:33:46,820
Tim, you are not helping yourself.

3045
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:53,800
If you really, really want to dox yourself right now in front of all these people,

3046
01:33:58,500 --> 01:34:02,120
legally, maybe you should do that on your own channel.

3047
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:10,600
Look, I'm not saying you should come and, like, help me.

3048
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:12,440
Legally, he's not threatening you guys.

3049
01:34:12,580 --> 01:34:14,080
It's all a joke, by the way.

3050
01:34:15,220 --> 01:34:16,100
I'm not...

3051
01:34:16,100 --> 01:34:24,220
I'm not saying that, like, I have a lot of stress and anger to release, but...

3052
01:34:24,220 --> 01:34:25,280
In Minecraft, right?

3053
01:34:25,820 --> 01:34:26,920
In Minecraft, yeah.

3054
01:34:26,980 --> 01:34:27,160
Yeah.

3055
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:29,780
Like, this is clearly... this is clearly a Minecraft.

3056
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:32,480
Yeah, I got some Minecraft.

3057
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:35,040
Yeah, guys, in Minecraft.

3058
01:34:36,580 --> 01:34:39,500
If... on my channel, it's in Minecraft, guys.

3059
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:45,100
Wait, why do you have a sword in your kitchen?

3060
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:49,160
Uh, so I actually have a lot of swords in my kitchen.

3061
01:34:49,300 --> 01:34:49,900
Don't worry about it.

3062
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,820
It's, you know, let's... it's for choice.

3063
01:34:52,040 --> 01:34:52,840
You know, like, if...

3064
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:53,720
Wait, can you cook with that?

3065
01:34:53,720 --> 01:34:54,460
If someone comes...

3066
01:34:54,460 --> 01:34:55,340
Can you cut a chicken?

3067
01:34:55,340 --> 01:34:55,980
Yes, I actually have...

3068
01:34:55,980 --> 01:34:56,780
Yes, I can.

3069
01:34:56,840 --> 01:34:57,680
Cut the chicken!

3070
01:34:57,680 --> 01:34:58,360
Wait.

3071
01:34:58,360 --> 01:35:00,620
That's... that is literally why I...

3072
01:35:00,620 --> 01:35:00,880
Wait.

3073
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:02,660
We're supposed to be selling a Doki plate, not a...

3074
01:35:02,660 --> 01:35:03,000
No, no, no.

3075
01:35:03,060 --> 01:35:04,300
Wait, cut the chicken.

3076
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:05,240
It doesn't matter.

3077
01:35:05,380 --> 01:35:06,000
What are they gonna do?

3078
01:35:06,120 --> 01:35:06,900
Buy that sword?

3079
01:35:06,980 --> 01:35:08,020
We're gonna... we're gonna cut that...

3080
01:35:08,020 --> 01:35:09,120
We're gonna... we're gonna cut that...

3081
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:10,000
We're gonna cut this on the Doki board, yeah.

3082
01:35:10,180 --> 01:35:12,020
Yeah, you just cut that... cut that chicken.

3083
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:14,320
Wait, how sharp is it?

3084
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:15,080
Everyone got some good angles?

3085
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:18,880
It's not too sharp because, uh, swords need a different geometry.

3086
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:20,140
Um, but...

3087
01:35:20,140 --> 01:35:20,940
Is it cake, guys?

3088
01:35:21,680 --> 01:35:22,040
Is...

3089
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:26,080
Is it cake?

3090
01:35:27,100 --> 01:35:28,000
All right.

3091
01:35:28,260 --> 01:35:28,920
You guys ready?

3092
01:35:29,340 --> 01:35:29,660
Yeah.

3093
01:35:30,740 --> 01:35:31,580
I'm ready.

3094
01:35:31,960 --> 01:35:32,440
Three...

3095
01:35:32,440 --> 01:35:33,080
Two...

3096
01:35:33,080 --> 01:35:34,660
All right, let me...

3097
01:35:34,660 --> 01:35:35,540
Let me actually...

3098
01:35:37,080 --> 01:35:38,600
I don't wanna stance this.

3099
01:35:40,740 --> 01:35:42,400
Guys, he's a poser.

3100
01:35:43,660 --> 01:35:45,560
Doesn't even know how to hold this...

3101
01:35:45,560 --> 01:35:45,680
Whoa!

3102
01:35:45,680 --> 01:35:46,480
What do you mean?

3103
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:47,520
I'm a poser!

3104
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:50,040
I can't believe you would say that!

3105
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:53,860
That is a dull-ass knife, not gonna lie.

3106
01:35:54,620 --> 01:35:56,060
That's a dull-ass knife.

3107
01:35:56,200 --> 01:35:57,280
Yeah, and that's why.

3108
01:35:57,580 --> 01:35:59,320
Now show what it's like with the Doki blade.

3109
01:35:59,700 --> 01:36:00,160
See, you got...

3110
01:36:00,160 --> 01:36:01,120
Look, compare it.

3111
01:36:01,260 --> 01:36:02,540
This is a before and after.

3112
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:02,820
Yeah.

3113
01:36:03,160 --> 01:36:03,460
Chat.

3114
01:36:05,860 --> 01:36:06,820
It's actually...

3115
01:36:06,820 --> 01:36:07,840
Oh my god, I'm gonna have to wash that after.

3116
01:36:09,580 --> 01:36:12,080
And now, if we do it with the Doki blade...

3117
01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:12,320
Watch.

3118
01:36:12,340 --> 01:36:13,360
Yeah, look at this.

3119
01:36:13,820 --> 01:36:14,420
Ooh!

3120
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:16,460
Look at that!

3121
01:36:16,860 --> 01:36:17,240
You see?

3122
01:36:17,720 --> 01:36:20,180
You can't do that with the clay more.

3123
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:22,780
Look at that!

3124
01:36:23,020 --> 01:36:23,160
Ooh!

3125
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:27,920
More like a mash more.

3126
01:36:28,180 --> 01:36:28,600
Honestly, I'm hitting...

3127
01:36:29,240 --> 01:36:32,100
I'm like hitting into bone everywhere, so it's not really cutting.

3128
01:36:32,340 --> 01:36:32,880
Whoa!

3129
01:36:33,220 --> 01:36:33,980
Look at that!

3130
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:35,460
Look at that cut!

3131
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:36,920
So smooth.

3132
01:36:38,280 --> 01:36:39,400
Did you hit it?

3133
01:36:41,480 --> 01:36:42,520
Oh my...

3134
01:36:42,520 --> 01:36:42,740
Whoop!

3135
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:43,440
Coby!

3136
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:47,800
Yeah, so there's a bone in there.

3137
01:36:48,020 --> 01:36:49,480
There's a lot of bones in this.

3138
01:36:50,980 --> 01:36:51,860
That's great!

3139
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:52,480
Oh!

3140
01:36:52,860 --> 01:36:56,040
Thanks for showing us, Chef Tim, on how to make...

3141
01:36:56,040 --> 01:37:00,580
How to make two bentos with ten microwaves.

3142
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:01,880
That was a great time.

3143
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:10,920
Yeah, and remember, everyone, you need to go buy the Doki Blade, because I have a lot of lawsuits I need to take care of.

3144
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:12,000
Yeah, and I'm one of them!

3145
01:37:12,620 --> 01:37:14,020
Wait, close up on the blade!

3146
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:14,640
Close up!

3147
01:37:14,740 --> 01:37:15,260
Camera two!

3148
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:16,180
Close up!

3149
01:37:16,940 --> 01:37:17,460
Camera!

3150
01:37:17,820 --> 01:37:18,680
Camera two!

3151
01:37:19,420 --> 01:37:20,480
Show that blade!

3152
01:37:21,480 --> 01:37:26,320
Guys, yeah, so all the stuff we've cooked with the tools we used.

3153
01:37:26,460 --> 01:37:27,820
That's the wrong camera, Tim.

3154
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:29,080
That's...

3155
01:37:30,180 --> 01:37:31,080
There you go.

3156
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:39,420
So you can buy all these equipment, or pre-order them right now, including the Doki Blade, the Bento Box, the Chopsticks, and the Doki Boy!

3157
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:40,840
Yeah!

3158
01:37:42,100 --> 01:37:43,020
Look at him go!

3159
01:37:43,240 --> 01:37:43,480
Also, this can...

3160
01:37:43,480 --> 01:37:45,320
Oh my god, he's doing it again.

3161
01:37:45,580 --> 01:37:46,380
Also, after all that...

3162
01:37:46,380 --> 01:37:47,340
Oh my god.

3163
01:37:47,680 --> 01:37:48,020
It can still shave hair.

3164
01:37:48,460 --> 01:37:49,520
Oh my god.

3165
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:49,700
Oh my god.

3166
01:37:49,860 --> 01:37:50,600
Fucking crazy.

3167
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:55,020
Because this is VG10, it is hardened to 61 HRC.

3168
01:37:55,120 --> 01:37:57,740
I know those don't mean very little to people, but I am a knife nerd.

3169
01:37:58,220 --> 01:38:05,120
Also, I will be coming out with a full explanation, where I just rant about how the knife was designed and all of its features and all that kind of stuff, so look out for that.

3170
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:05,700
Yeah!

3171
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:06,520
Also, I...

3172
01:38:07,220 --> 01:38:09,240
Oh my god, I damaged the shit out of this one.

3173
01:38:09,240 --> 01:38:09,880
Wait, did you do it?

3174
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:11,260
Was that right over the Bento?

3175
01:38:12,500 --> 01:38:12,900
What?

3176
01:38:13,180 --> 01:38:13,660
No, I...

3177
01:38:13,660 --> 01:38:15,240
No, I did it over the board.

3178
01:38:15,340 --> 01:38:15,860
I'm just...

3179
01:38:15,860 --> 01:38:16,600
Oh, okay.

3180
01:38:16,860 --> 01:38:18,080
There's some pretty deep cuts in the board now.

3181
01:38:18,220 --> 01:38:18,700
That knife...

3182
01:38:18,700 --> 01:38:18,920
That...

3183
01:38:18,920 --> 01:38:20,100
The sword's pretty...

3184
01:38:20,100 --> 01:38:20,560
Actually...

3185
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:20,840
Oh, shit.

3186
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:22,300
That's not even that bad.

3187
01:38:23,300 --> 01:38:24,260
Oh my god, wait, hang on.

3188
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:25,480
I gotta show you guys this.

3189
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:26,020
Oh, wait.

3190
01:38:26,160 --> 01:38:27,260
Like, for a Claymore?

3191
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:30,120
For a Claymore slamming onto this thing?

3192
01:38:30,200 --> 01:38:30,580
This is...

3193
01:38:30,580 --> 01:38:31,240
This is...

3194
01:38:31,240 --> 01:38:33,100
That's a thick-ass Dragoon, though.

3195
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:34,680
Yeah.

3196
01:38:35,480 --> 01:38:36,180
You know, we...

3197
01:38:36,180 --> 01:38:37,460
We like the Dragoons thick.

3198
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:38,220
Look at that.

3199
01:38:39,120 --> 01:38:40,020
Camera two.

3200
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:40,740
Would you...

3201
01:38:40,740 --> 01:38:41,420
Look at that.

3202
01:38:41,620 --> 01:38:42,020
Would you...

3203
01:38:42,020 --> 01:38:47,220
Would you think that this cutting board got slammed on by a Claymore?

3204
01:38:48,780 --> 01:38:49,760
Like, look at that.

3205
01:38:49,980 --> 01:38:50,660
No, look at...

3206
01:38:50,660 --> 01:38:51,220
This is...

3207
01:38:51,220 --> 01:38:52,560
This is real hardwood.

3208
01:38:52,760 --> 01:38:54,980
This is real pieces of hardwood.

3209
01:38:55,260 --> 01:38:55,680
Like, you can...

3210
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:56,480
You can see the grain.

3211
01:38:56,620 --> 01:38:58,380
This isn't, like, painted on or anything.

3212
01:38:58,520 --> 01:38:58,820
That's...

3213
01:38:58,820 --> 01:39:00,340
You can use it as a shield.

3214
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:01,440
Or...

3215
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:02,540
You can.

3216
01:39:03,200 --> 01:39:03,820
Sort of.

3217
01:39:04,140 --> 01:39:04,200
Yeah.

3218
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:04,540
Yeah, actually.

3219
01:39:04,820 --> 01:39:06,500
Hey, Sean, you got your arrows?

3220
01:39:06,640 --> 01:39:06,860
You wanna...

3221
01:39:06,860 --> 01:39:07,420
You wanna...

3222
01:39:07,420 --> 01:39:09,120
Okay, maybe not here.

3223
01:39:09,460 --> 01:39:10,120
Maybe not.

3224
01:39:11,100 --> 01:39:12,100
Maybe not here.

3225
01:39:12,460 --> 01:39:13,540
Maybe not here.

3226
01:39:13,540 --> 01:39:14,300
Maybe on your own channel.

3227
01:39:14,460 --> 01:39:15,380
That's fine with me.

3228
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:17,480
Yeah.

3229
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:19,260
They put hard in hardwood.

3230
01:39:21,740 --> 01:39:22,720
I didn't say that.

3231
01:39:23,120 --> 01:39:23,980
I didn't say that you did.

3232
01:39:23,980 --> 01:39:24,460
From chat.

3233
01:39:25,700 --> 01:39:26,060
Yoink.

3234
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:27,180
My joke now.

3235
01:39:28,040 --> 01:39:28,180
Yup.

3236
01:39:29,320 --> 01:39:30,040
And so...

3237
01:39:30,500 --> 01:39:31,800
I like where I'm like, ah, yes.

3238
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:32,420
Look at...

3239
01:39:32,420 --> 01:39:33,060
Look at this.

3240
01:39:33,140 --> 01:39:35,060
That's filled with all the oil and all the stuff.

3241
01:39:35,200 --> 01:39:37,000
This is how you know I have ADHD, guys.

3242
01:39:37,240 --> 01:39:37,420
Like...

3243
01:39:37,420 --> 01:39:38,740
This is when you can tell it's...

3244
01:39:38,740 --> 01:39:40,140
It's the real deal.

3245
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:41,340
With all the stuff.

3246
01:39:41,380 --> 01:39:41,860
Real cooking!

3247
01:39:42,120 --> 01:39:42,360
Yeah!

3248
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:43,380
Real cooking!

3249
01:39:44,540 --> 01:39:45,560
All those cooking shows.

3250
01:39:45,700 --> 01:39:47,980
And everyone's just like, ah, yes, I got a pristine kitchen all the time.

3251
01:39:48,100 --> 01:39:48,860
What are you doing?

3252
01:39:49,220 --> 01:39:52,080
Like, are you, like, cleaning every single time?

3253
01:39:52,240 --> 01:39:52,880
Like, what?

3254
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:54,920
That's not what real cooking looks like!

3255
01:39:55,500 --> 01:39:57,220
This is what real cooking looks like!

3256
01:40:00,040 --> 01:40:00,840
That's normal!

3257
01:40:00,980 --> 01:40:01,420
That's okay!

3258
01:40:01,900 --> 01:40:02,060
Yeah!

3259
01:40:02,460 --> 01:40:04,980
But if your kitchen looks like this, you're doing good!

3260
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:05,460
Yeah!

3261
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:06,560
You're just cleaning afterwards!

3262
01:40:07,400 --> 01:40:08,840
That's the worst part, though.

3263
01:40:09,420 --> 01:40:10,880
That's the worst part about cooking.

3264
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:12,180
It is.

3265
01:40:13,100 --> 01:40:13,640
But hey!

3266
01:40:13,640 --> 01:40:14,080
It is.

3267
01:40:14,180 --> 01:40:16,860
And unfortunately, I got shit everywhere, so...

3268
01:40:16,860 --> 01:40:18,080
Yeah, that's very unfortunate.

3269
01:40:18,420 --> 01:40:18,740
I'm gonna clean that up.

3270
01:40:18,740 --> 01:40:21,600
Thank God you have Terrence here to help you.

3271
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:22,460
And Leo.

3272
01:40:23,080 --> 01:40:24,260
You go, Leo.

3273
01:40:27,080 --> 01:40:28,860
You think that food was free?

3274
01:40:29,120 --> 01:40:30,340
No, it's cleaning time.

3275
01:40:32,280 --> 01:40:35,400
Yeah, they do get to be fed all of this afterwards, though.

3276
01:40:35,540 --> 01:40:36,080
So, you know.

3277
01:40:36,460 --> 01:40:37,660
That's gonna be pretty good.

3278
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:40,820
But yeah, it was fun!

3279
01:40:41,980 --> 01:40:42,460
Yeah!

3280
01:40:42,460 --> 01:40:43,180
Yeah, thanks for hosting.

3281
01:40:43,420 --> 01:40:44,120
And if you ever...

3282
01:40:44,120 --> 01:40:46,960
And remember, buy the Dogi Blade and...

3283
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:47,200
Yeah!

3284
01:40:47,200 --> 01:40:48,640
You can do the end chilling part.

3285
01:40:49,120 --> 01:40:49,660
Yeah, guys!

3286
01:40:49,980 --> 01:40:50,780
You can buy...

3287
01:40:50,780 --> 01:40:55,300
You can pre-order all that merch right now on the Vite Ramen collab store.

3288
01:40:55,300 --> 01:40:57,400
It's literally pinned in my chat.

3289
01:40:57,700 --> 01:40:57,740
It's literally pinned in my chat.

3290
01:40:57,740 --> 01:40:59,840
Wait, I'll just spam the link right now.

3291
01:41:00,040 --> 01:41:01,120
Because I can do that.

3292
01:41:02,020 --> 01:41:02,400
All right.

3293
01:41:02,500 --> 01:41:03,140
Oh my gosh, wait.

3294
01:41:03,540 --> 01:41:04,080
Let me...

3295
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:07,000
Okay, let me grab the link real fast so I can spam it.

3296
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:07,820
All right, guys!

3297
01:41:08,020 --> 01:41:10,460
Click on this link and you can pre-order now!

3298
01:41:11,240 --> 01:41:15,700
For your very own Vite Ramen and DogiBird collab merch items.

3299
01:41:16,100 --> 01:41:20,760
Like the Doki board, the Doki blade, the bento boxes, the chopsticks.

3300
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:22,940
Am I missing anything?

3301
01:41:23,380 --> 01:41:23,960
Is that...

3302
01:41:23,960 --> 01:41:24,500
Yeah, that's...

3303
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:24,880
Nope, that's...

3304
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:24,940
Yep.

3305
01:41:25,020 --> 01:41:26,280
That's all, folks!

3306
01:41:27,260 --> 01:41:28,140
That's all, folks!

3307
01:41:28,440 --> 01:41:28,740
Yeah!

3308
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:30,680
So you can get one yourself, too!

3309
01:41:31,400 --> 01:41:32,720
But thank you, Tim!

3310
01:41:33,120 --> 01:41:33,180
Let's see if I can...

3311
01:41:33,180 --> 01:41:34,400
Thank you, Tim, for...

3312
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:34,720
Yeah, thank you!

3313
01:41:34,900 --> 01:41:36,500
...for doing this stream with me.

3314
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:37,340
That was really fun.

3315
01:41:37,340 --> 01:41:38,640
I learned a lot today.

3316
01:41:40,100 --> 01:41:40,460
Okay.

3317
01:41:40,460 --> 01:41:40,860
Wait, can we...

3318
01:41:40,860 --> 01:41:41,580
Hang on, hang on.

3319
01:41:41,700 --> 01:41:42,760
I need to do this real quick.

3320
01:41:42,760 --> 01:41:42,900
What are you doing?

3321
01:41:44,740 --> 01:41:45,100
Yeah!

3322
01:41:46,040 --> 01:41:50,700
Yeah, you can 360 no-scope your food now, Chad, with the iron sights.

3323
01:41:50,840 --> 01:41:51,140
Oh, God.

3324
01:41:51,400 --> 01:41:51,760
Please...

3325
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:52,280
Please don't.

3326
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:54,840
Oh, yeah.

3327
01:41:54,900 --> 01:41:56,820
How long would the pre-orders be up for, Tim?

3328
01:41:57,820 --> 01:41:58,980
So we're keeping pre-orders...

3329
01:41:58,980 --> 01:42:03,480
So what we usually do is we keep pre-orders open until we start to see, like, everything is starting to drop off.

3330
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:05,740
And then we go, hey, final call, if you missed it.

3331
01:42:05,900 --> 01:42:07,200
And then we put in our orders.

3332
01:42:07,200 --> 01:42:07,800
Okay.

3333
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:10,340
But how long would that usually be, in your opinion?

3334
01:42:10,500 --> 01:42:10,900
Usually...

3335
01:42:10,900 --> 01:42:11,980
Yeah, usually that's...

3336
01:42:11,980 --> 01:42:14,520
Usually that's after I finish yapping about knives.

3337
01:42:14,720 --> 01:42:15,440
So probably a month.

3338
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:16,100
A month?

3339
01:42:16,220 --> 01:42:16,720
Okay, yeah.

3340
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:19,360
So you have a month to pre-order these.

3341
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:21,860
So a month to save up if you're actually...

3342
01:42:21,860 --> 01:42:25,740
If you're looking forward to grabbing these before the pre-order ends, guys.

3343
01:42:25,740 --> 01:42:26,940
But thank you, Tim.

3344
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:28,780
It was a pleasure to be here.

3345
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:31,820
I had a great time for this cooking show.

3346
01:42:32,040 --> 01:42:32,920
It was a great experience.

3347
01:42:33,160 --> 01:42:34,040
I think Chad loves it.

3348
01:42:34,180 --> 01:42:38,840
Chad, did you have a good time watching Tim hurt himself for our enjoyment?

3349
01:42:40,220 --> 01:42:44,440
And remember to say thank you to the tomato that gave him skin for this?

3350
01:42:45,700 --> 01:42:47,000
Yeah, Doki.

3351
01:42:47,300 --> 01:42:48,400
You had a great time.

3352
01:42:50,720 --> 01:42:52,340
Yeah, check out Vite Ramen.

3353
01:42:52,580 --> 01:42:55,040
Check out Tim, the CEO of Vite Ramen.

3354
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:56,620
All right.

3355
01:42:56,920 --> 01:42:57,940
But thank you, Tim.

3356
01:42:58,500 --> 01:42:58,720
Yep.

3357
01:42:58,980 --> 01:42:59,480
Thank you.

3358
01:42:59,580 --> 01:43:00,240
Thank you.

3359
01:43:00,500 --> 01:43:00,560
And now...

3360
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:01,640
I'll do an ending intro.

3361
01:43:01,640 --> 01:43:02,220
I need to clean up.

3362
01:43:02,300 --> 01:43:04,400
Yeah, you do a clean up while I do my ending thing.

3363
01:43:04,640 --> 01:43:05,160
All right, guys.

3364
01:43:05,340 --> 01:43:06,220
As always, everybody.

3365
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:07,340
Stay hydrated.

3366
01:43:07,540 --> 01:43:08,040
Posture check.

3367
01:43:08,300 --> 01:43:10,220
Get up and move around and get that blood flowing.

3368
01:43:10,380 --> 01:43:12,880
And you stay up for us, me, Tim, and I.

3369
01:43:13,080 --> 01:43:14,640
Head to bed because you deserve it.

3370
01:43:14,740 --> 01:43:16,180
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

3371
01:43:16,660 --> 01:43:17,380
Bye, guys.

3372
01:43:17,740 --> 01:43:18,100
Bye.
