00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,680
Hello everybody!

2
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,620
Did you fucking know if you don't play- if you don't touch the game, fucking Arlo the horse takes over as the main character?

3
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,360
Like what the fuck?

4
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:08,720
I like booted up my game and I was like, oh hey there's me sleeping.

5
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,400
And then suddenly the camera locks into fucking Arlo.

6
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,020
I was like, what's he doing?

7
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,400
And then he walks away.

8
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,160
I was like, what the fuck?

9
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,820
What the fuck is going on?

10
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,400
So I was just like watching the horse.

11
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:31,760
I was literally just like watching the horse just fucking walking away from my body.

12
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,560
And he just runs around.

13
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,140
And I was just like, where is he going?

14
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,520
Where the fuck is this horse going?

15
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,520
I was like, I thought I was the main character.

16
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,140
What the fuck is going on?

17
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,380
So like while I was just waiting for him to come back.

18
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,380
I was just trying to fix the stream.

19
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,080
Because you know, I actually almost started with a 10 minute delay.

20
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,260
Because I was like, why is the start stream not going out?

21
00:02:54,440 --> 00:03:03,780
I was like, why isn't the starting screen not fucking- why is it not letting me start the stream?

22
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,880
And I was like, oh the 10 minute delay.

23
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,200
So yeah, we're just gonna- Look see I'm the last- It's so weird.

24
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,820
I'm also on the left side of the screen.

25
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,100
I know.

26
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,760
I know it's like really rare to see me on the left side of the screen.

27
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:29,080
But I've had people on the last Shadow Colossus being like, I need to see the stamina bar.

28
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,120
Where's the stamina bar, Dokie?

29
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,580
Where the fuck is the stamina bar?

30
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:40,020
So then like, you know, I decided to be like, you know what?

31
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,600
I'll be nice today.

32
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:43,820
I'll be nice today.

33
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,520
Today, I feel nice today.

34
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,980
Okay, don't say I don't do nothing for you guys.

35
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,980
Okay, guys, don't say I don't do anything for you guys.

36
00:03:54,180 --> 00:04:00,040
Because I, um, I worked so hard to be on the left screen.

37
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,080
Just so you guys know, I worked so fucking hard.

38
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:11,720
It took so much courage and determination to like break out of routine and like be on the left side.

39
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:15,380
So if you say I don't do anything for you guys, that's a fucking lie.

40
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,580
Because now I'm on the left side of the screen.

41
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,700
Oh shit, what happened to Arlo?

42
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,800
Oh, it's night time?

43
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,460
Okay.

44
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,540
I guess, I guess now that it's night time, they're like, Arlo is like, never mind.

45
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,640
But yes, anyway, a little update.

46
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,980
I know it's like, it seems out of nowhere.

47
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,160
But I now have my creep- Okay, well I always had my creator code.

48
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,520
But just so you guys know, this creator code is actually the old creator code.

49
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,680
But I name changed it to Doki Bird.

50
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,700
So like now, the old creator code doesn't work anymore.

51
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,220
So you have to use Doki Bird.

52
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:05,900
And I wanna say like a huge shout out to Fortnite.

53
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:11,880
Because like they actually like, uh, was like, was a real- I was talking to a real person by the way.

54
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,960
Like I- I actually got fired.

55
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,480
I had to talk to a real person.

56
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,380
And they like helped me.

57
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,860
They were like, oh, we're gonna have to figure this out today.

58
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:21,820
Like slash tomorrow.

59
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:22,640
Like, you know, tomorrow.

60
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,880
Because I contacted them on Sunday.

61
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,940
And it's like, it was like, I don't know, 6pm on a Sunday.

62
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,700
And then they're like, um, okay.

63
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:34,520
So they're like, okay, we're gonna like try and see if we could like get it fixed tomorrow.

64
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,740
When like the staff is there.

65
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,240
And then I was like, okay.

66
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,540
And then I received a message.

67
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,080
And they're like, oh, we actually can help you with it right now.

68
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,080
And then we had to like grab some stuff.

69
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,860
Grab some information.

70
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,120
Um...

71
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,440
And then like, uh...

72
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:53,100
And then they managed to actually- At first I was just like, oh, I just want to like, you know, just get my skins.

73
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:53,560
I don't care.

74
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,240
I don't care about losing everything else.

75
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,920
Please just give me my skins.

76
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,180
I was like, please.

77
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,040
I don't care about my Fortnite skins.

78
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,460
Bro, please.

79
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,800
I retail therapy'd so hard on Fortnite.

80
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,900
Because Fortnite skins was the only thing that made me happy back then.

81
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,080
And I bought a John Cena Fortnite skin.

82
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,660
And then I bought like basketball.

83
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,760
Dragon Ball Z Cell skin.

84
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,300
Please.

85
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,620
I bought so many dance emotes.

86
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,000
Please.

87
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,040
And then- And then they were like, oh, you know what?

88
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,580
We can get you your entire Epic account back.

89
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,500
We'll like help you change the email.

90
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,860
I was like, oh, thank God.

91
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,260
I was like- I was just like, oh, thank God.

92
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,840
I- You know what?

93
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,200
I- I came in here with super low expectations.

94
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,900
Because I thought I was not even able to get back my account.

95
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,640
Because everybody would tell me it was so hard.

96
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,680
To get back your account.

97
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,660
And that like, I just have to be ready for them to say no.

98
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:53,800
Because like my manager couldn't like get in touch with anybody for two months.

99
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,160
I even asked the Twitch staff.

100
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,920
Because they've done Twitch Rivals with Fortnite.

101
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,340
And they were like, oh, just so you know.

102
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,600
Go in with super low expectations, man.

103
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,120
I don't know.

104
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,580
Because I was like, can you reach out to Fortnite for me?

105
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:10,380
And Fortnite staff had asked them if they could get me my account back.

106
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,620
And even Twitch staff was like, oh, you have to go in with super low expectations.

107
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:18,680
And then- And then I put in my last ditch effort.

108
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,400
Public pressure.

109
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:33,490
Because- Because if it can work out for YouTube, maybe it can work on Fortnite.

110
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:41,570
If nothing else works, public pressure is my last ditch effort.

111
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:44,970
I- I'm not- I'm not a Fortnite fan.

112
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:45,590
I'm not ashamed.

113
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,670
I'm not- I'm- I'm not ashamed.

114
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:51,250
I- I was desperate, guys.

115
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,970
So thank you, everybody, for signal boosting.

116
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,270
I was so fucking desperate.

117
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:59,590
I really- I really wanted my account back.

118
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:10,110
So thank you guys for- For helping out and helping me signal boost.

119
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:12,010
So that Fortnite saw the tweet.

120
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:14,350
And they like personally DM'd me.

121
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,810
And was like, hey, we can help you out.

122
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:18,570
And I was like, oh my God, a real person.

123
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:27,170
I was like- I was like, oh my God, a real person wants to help me out.

124
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:35,990
I was so- Bro, even- Even Twitch was like, bro, I don't know, man.

125
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:43,170
Even Twitch was like, I don't- This is what happened!

126
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,950
Arlo's going on his own adventure again.

127
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:48,390
Because at first I was like, there's me.

128
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:51,610
I was like, wait, why is the camera moving away from me?

129
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:52,810
What is going on?

130
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:57,150
What the fuck is- Why is the camera moving away?

131
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:58,870
That's not me!

132
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,790
And then he fucking just starts running around the map.

133
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,870
The real- The real main character.

134
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:14,750
But yeah, that is the story of how I- I got my Fortnite account back.

135
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:19,550
So for those who were like- For those who were like, what does the creator code do?

136
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:26,290
Basically, it's basically like when you go to the shop, there's like support a creator and you just copy and paste on Fortnite.

137
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:27,530
And then you just paste Doki Bird.

138
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:39,850
And basically it's like every purchase you make in the shop, whether you're buying V-Bucks or whether you're buying any item in the shop, I get like- I don't remember what the percent was.

139
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,770
I think it was like 5% or was it?

140
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:42,590
It was like 5%.

141
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:49,450
I remember like back then, I made a joke be- I was- people were like saying, no Doki, you have a problem with Fortnite skins.

142
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:58,710
But like the first month of Fortnite, the first month my creator- creator code came out, I got $2,500.

143
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:03,390
And that was 5% of whatever the fuck you guys were purchasing.

144
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:06,010
So like in the end, I don't have a problem.

145
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:23,990
If I get 5% and I end up getting $2,500 in the first month from people using my creator code, I'm not the one with the problem.

146
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:38,330
So we all- we all as a group have issues.

147
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:41,750
All of us have issues.

148
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,870
It's not just me.

149
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:50,410
Because I got 5% and that 5% was $2,500.

150
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:56,250
So somebody- some of you dragons have more of a problem than me.

151
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:01,770
Someone calculate how many V-Bucks- how many dollars worth of V-Bucks was that?

152
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:02,850
Something-

153
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:11,730
So you guys- you guys can't judge me on my specs.

154
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:12,310
I have spending issues.

155
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,010
What the hell?

156
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:16,930
Yeah.

157
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:21,650
You guys can't judge me anymore when it comes to my spending.

158
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:28,270
Anyway, I'm glad there's no 10 minute delay.

159
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:34,090
Because I accidentally almost spent- have a- have like 10 minute delay there.

160
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:34,730
Alright.

161
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:39,850
Today, we're gonna re- oh I also forgot how to play this game cause like...

162
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:40,750
Uh...

163
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,490
I forgot how to play this game cause it's been a while.

164
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:48,830
We were able to play it last week so you guys are gonna help me with remembering this.

165
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:50,870
Alright Arlo, this is my time.

166
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,030
You're not the main character anymore.

167
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:53,770
Continue.

168
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,750
Oh I got to defeat five colossi.

169
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:57,730
Wait, colossi- oh yeah!

170
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,570
Colossi is the plural of Colossus.

171
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:00,690
Whoops.

172
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:01,250
Alright.

173
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,290
I'll play this game again.

174
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,650
It's not an issue.

175
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,410
I can stop whenever I want.

176
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:10,250
Aphelia, thank you for the- for the super chat.

177
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:10,570
Thank you.

178
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:11,090
Thank you.

179
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:11,870
Alright.

180
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:12,550
Okay.

181
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,810
This is the hitting button.

182
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:18,670
Okay and then- why is my camera so wonky right now?

183
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,530
Alright.

184
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:20,290
Okay.

185
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:21,170
And then...

186
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,510
That's Arlo.

187
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:24,810
And then...

188
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,210
Alright, where is it?

189
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:28,910
Where is it?

190
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:29,670
This way?

191
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:31,550
Alright, we have to go this way.

192
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,170
Alright, Arlo.

193
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:35,190
It's back to figuring how to control this camera.

194
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,410
Alright, five down.

195
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:38,090
Okay, wait.

196
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,550
Where is it?

197
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,770
This way.

198
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:42,570
Alright, here we go.

199
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:45,610
How do I- how do I- wait, I can stand up?

200
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:47,770
Wait, why would I need to stand up?

201
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,110
How did I do that?

202
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,890
How did I- how did I do that?

203
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:52,890
What- what?

204
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,110
Stand back up!

205
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:58,470
Stand back up!

206
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:02,090
Okay, now I can stand on- why would I need to stand on the horse?

207
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:03,930
I don't understand- to jump?

208
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:04,570
Oh!

209
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,050
Oh, that is not gonna be fun.

210
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:08,830
Okay.

211
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:14,390
That is- that is not gonna be fun when I actually have to do that.

212
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:15,830
Okay, how do I ride this horse?

213
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:16,790
Okay.

214
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:18,550
Alright.

215
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:23,130
How do I- guys, I'm trying to remember how to ride this horse.

216
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,410
Okay, triangle.

217
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:26,150
Alright, it's triangle.

218
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:26,650
Okay.

219
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:28,450
Okay, where do I have to go?

220
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:29,770
Oh, God.

221
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:30,250
Oh, God.

222
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:31,670
I remember now why I hated this.

223
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,290
I hated the horse riding mechanic.

224
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:34,130
I remember now.

225
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:35,470
I remember now.

226
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:35,690
I remember now.

227
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:38,810
I remember now.

228
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:41,990
I remember now why I hated it.

229
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:42,310
Chat.

230
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,670
Alright, let's try and remember- alright.

231
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:46,510
How many?

232
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:47,890
Eleven, right?

233
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,050
We have eleven to go?

234
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:50,930
Alright.

235
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:52,390
Don't worry.

236
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:53,910
This is gaming hours.

237
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:55,050
Right here.

238
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:56,210
The moment- look.

239
00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:09,470
Even though- even though, like, um, I'm very forgetful and that, like, uh, and, like, it takes me a while to figure out the mechanics, but the moment I figure it out, I go- I go- I'm full gamer.

240
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:11,090
You can't deny that, chat.

241
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:16,670
The moment I figure out the mechanics, even though, like, you know, I'm a little slow at figuring stuff out.

242
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:22,010
I start gaming, okay?

243
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,330
Okay, guys.

244
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:24,830
Just so you remember.

245
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:29,050
I start gaming the moment I realize what the mechanics are.

246
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,790
Alright, do I have to go up?

247
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,210
The fuck is it?

248
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,210
It's, like, here.

249
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:34,910
What's the map?

250
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:36,090
Alright.

251
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:36,510
Okay.

252
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:38,510
Okay.

253
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,470
And is it, like- do I get to climb this?

254
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,010
Let's see.

255
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,330
Or do I go around it?

256
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:45,370
Do I go around this?

257
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:47,750
Maybe?

258
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:50,010
Is there an around?

259
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,850
Or maybe I can climb.

260
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:55,270
You know what?

261
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:56,110
Maybe I can climb this.

262
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:57,270
Okay.

263
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:57,530
Wait.

264
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:58,670
Does the fruit do anything?

265
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:00,230
There's fruit here?

266
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:02,750
Can I eat that?

267
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:04,770
Can I eat the fruit?

268
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:05,870
Alright, let's see.

269
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,070
How do I- Okay.

270
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,070
I'm crouching.

271
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:09,970
Alright.

272
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:10,930
Let's see if I can eat the fruit.

273
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:13,750
Oh, I can eat the fruit!

274
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:15,150
Can I?

275
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:16,950
Guys.

276
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,990
I don't know if I pick up?

277
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:21,230
Pick up the fruit?

278
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:23,690
Oh!

279
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:25,630
Okay.

280
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:26,550
Wait.

281
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:27,590
How do I eat it?

282
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:28,390
Eat the fruit.

283
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:30,210
Eat the fruit.

284
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:33,270
Eat the fruit!

285
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,500
Guys, I eat the fruit.

286
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,060
I'm so screwed.

287
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,260
Guys, I figured it out.

288
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,600
It was hard to see.

289
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,420
I told you guys!

290
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,960
The moment I figured out the mechanics, I started gaming.

291
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:48,620
Oh wait, there's more.

292
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,640
I told you guys.

293
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,540
Camera, please.

294
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:58,520
The moment I figured this out, I started gaming.

295
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,140
Okay, this is not fair.

296
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:00,880
I actually have to...

297
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:05,340
This is not fair because I literally can't see it on the camera.

298
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,320
But look at that gaming.

299
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,000
This is called FPS.

300
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:14,240
Pure FPS skills right there.

301
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,560
Prediction time!

302
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,460
Actual gaming right there.

303
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,000
Alright, not to remember how to climb.

304
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,360
Okay.

305
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:25,900
Okay.

306
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,540
I can't climb this, guys.

307
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,360
Apparently I can't climb this.

308
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,300
Alright.

309
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:38,460
Alright, we gotta figure out how to get to the other colossi.

310
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:41,140
Alright.

311
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:41,640
Sorry.

312
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,340
Pure TPS right there.

313
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,620
Alright, now we have more HP.

314
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,500
I feel like maybe we can go around from here?

315
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:52,620
Right?

316
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,500
Oh no.

317
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,800
I wish there was a lost emote.

318
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,460
Maybe here?

319
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,940
It has to be here.

320
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,160
Is that an indent in the wall?

321
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,920
No, it's just a wall.

322
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:05,320
It's just a fucking wall.

323
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:06,980
Oh no.

324
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,440
This is the worst part.

325
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,680
It's the other way!

326
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,200
Okay, I'm going back.

327
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,740
Alright, we're figuring this out.

328
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:21,000
Guys, we're gonna figure this out.

329
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,360
Go Arlo, go.

330
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,120
Go Arlo, go.

331
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:29,420
Hey, like, at least I'm eating and drinking water.

332
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,160
Right?

333
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,300
My guy is actually eating and drinking water.

334
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,100
So like, you know, things are not bad.

335
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,040
You know?

336
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,460
He's staying hydrated and like...

337
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,180
He's staying hydrated and like...

338
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:42,660
surviving.

339
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,200
Okay.

340
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,840
This way.

341
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,000
Go Arlo, go.

342
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,120
Please.

343
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,020
It's really hard to open a...

344
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:56,440
an acupuncture massage parlor in this neighborhood.

345
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:00,340
We get like one client every like couple of months.

346
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,440
Don't worry.

347
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:06,000
My dead girlfriend will appreciate this for sure.

348
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,440
Do I go up?

349
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:08,940
Let's see.

350
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:09,880
Oh, no.

351
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,640
That's not the sword.

352
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,340
I wish I had a magical bow.

353
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:13,600
It sucks.

354
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,620
Why did the...

355
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:21,740
Why did the devil only bless my fucking sword and not my bow?

356
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:27,500
Like, if they can bless more than one thing... Like, if they can bless one thing, they might as well bless the other.

357
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,080
You know?

358
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,720
You need magical arrows?

359
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,620
I'll just come and pick it up.

360
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,180
It's not like I shot it pretty far.

361
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,000
If it's magical, it'll be glowing.

362
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,280
Please, Arlo!

363
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,280
Just walk around the trees.

364
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,820
Where the fuck do I go?

365
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,040
Oh, this is... Oh, no.

366
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:46,860
I don't like this.

367
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,560
Where am I?

368
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:50,900
Magic sword!

369
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,320
Where am I?

370
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,320
Okay, this way.

371
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:54,700
Alright.

372
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:56,780
There.

373
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:57,220
Look.

374
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,880
They can bless, like... Please.

375
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,200
Okay, I'm getting off.

376
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,960
I'm getting off!

377
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,680
Arlo's pissing me off.

378
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,480
I'm not lost yet!

379
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,700
I have the sun!

380
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,600
I have the power of the sun!

381
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,100
Wait, maybe it's down here?

382
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,840
It has to be, right?

383
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,780
Like, why would there be a cave?

384
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:23,880
Okay.

385
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,260
Nice.

386
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,520
Boon the Nomad.

387
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,260
What?

388
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,260
Where?

389
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,660
There's a person here?

390
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,360
I got an achievement.

391
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,600
Can I steal your stuff?

392
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,300
What?

393
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,440
Oh, is this an Easter egg?

394
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,740
I can't steal anything?

395
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,540
Why can't I steal anything?

396
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,060
Why can't I steal anything?

397
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,700
I'm having an Easter egg if I can't steal...

398
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,360
Oh, wait.

399
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:02,260
Wait.

400
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,660
What the fuck did I pick up?

401
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:05,500
That's it?

402
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,160
What's that?

403
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,440
What the fuck did I pick up?

404
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,780
What do I do with that?

405
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,400
It just exists?

406
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,480
It just...

407
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,100
What was that?

408
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,360
Okay.

409
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,040
Oh well.

410
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,060
It just exists in my pocket now.

411
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:32,320
I don't know what I received, but it just exists on me for some reason.

412
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:33,780
Alright.

413
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,140
Time to figure out where to go.

414
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,100
Sword.

415
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,600
Oh no.

416
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,500
Where the fuck's the sun?

417
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,100
All the trees are blocking the sun.

418
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,380
This way.

419
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:46,980
Okay.

420
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,300
It's this way.

421
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,020
Do I just jump down?

422
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:56,530
Is this it?

423
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,130
Oh, this is it.

424
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:00,530
That'll be fine.

425
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:02,410
Watch this.

426
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:03,470
Watch this, guys.

427
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,690
I don't know why he's hesitating.

428
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:19,950
I have a feeling I shouldn't jump down.

429
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:28,270
Do you guys think I can catch one of the rocks down there?

430
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:29,570
Do you guys think I can catch one of the rocks down there?

431
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:33,550
I think so.

432
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:34,090
Okay.

433
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:37,630
Actually, guys, I'm not gonna do it.

434
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:39,310
Because I need to find a shrine first.

435
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,130
I don't want to...

436
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:43,210
I don't want to shoot the things again.

437
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:48,810
Man, I wonder why the main character was hesitating just now.

438
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:50,830
I wonder why.

439
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:53,650
I think that's the road down, right?

440
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:55,410
This has to be the road down.

441
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:56,730
Okay.

442
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:57,570
Pew.

443
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,650
Oh, where's the sun?

444
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:02,530
Oh, this fucking tiny piece of shade blocked it?

445
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:04,770
Has to be here.

446
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,970
How do I get down from there?

447
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:10,430
Okay, I'm just...

448
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:12,490
That shouldn't kill me, right?

449
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,050
I don't know.

450
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:18,830
I like how the main character was like, No.

451
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:26,710
The main character was like, Please.

452
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:27,990
Please, Doki.

453
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,070
Don't do it.

454
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:29,650
I don't know.

455
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,630
Surely that will...

456
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:34,910
Arna, why are you running ahead?

457
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:36,470
Arna.

458
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:40,130
Look, I'm trying to...

459
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:41,270
I'm testing the limits.

460
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:45,370
I'm trying to like test the limits of like fall damage.

461
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:48,010
Okay.

462
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,690
Oh my god.

463
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:53,090
The horse riding mechanic has to be like the hardest mechanic.

464
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:54,410
Wait, what's this over there?

465
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,190
What's that over there?

466
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:57,390
There's like a little hole.

467
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,530
What is that?

468
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:00,670
Is that the way down?

469
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:02,590
Oh, it was.

470
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:03,770
I missed the hole.

471
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:04,370
Whoops.

472
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:05,390
Did I?

473
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:06,590
Did I miss the hole?

474
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:08,950
Oh my god.

475
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:09,290
Where...

476
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,850
This is just a tiny shade.

477
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:12,030
What do you mean?

478
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,650
I can't fucking see anything.

479
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:16,490
Alright, this has to be the place.

480
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:18,830
This has to be the area.

481
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,590
Oh my god.

482
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:21,850
Where the fuck is the shade?

483
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:25,390
Where's the sun?

484
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:27,490
Oh my god.

485
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:29,210
Oh, the clouds are blocking the sun.

486
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,930
How am I gonna find out where to go?

487
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,170
Is this the area?

488
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:35,310
Was it here?

489
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:36,550
Was I looking at here?

490
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:41,010
Oh, it's this way.

491
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:43,050
Wait, is this not the area?

492
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:45,670
Oh my god.

493
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:47,350
I'm just...

494
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:48,270
What?

495
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:51,330
Did I like activate something?

496
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:52,890
I can't...

497
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:55,150
The game was like, no.

498
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:59,670
I can't even jump over here.

499
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:00,410
It was like, no.

500
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:02,810
No cheesing.

501
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:12,370
I like how the game was like, no, no, no, donkey, no cheesing this.

502
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:16,090
I am looking at the map.

503
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:16,850
What do you mean?

504
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:18,670
I'm looking at it right now.

505
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:24,390
It's so hard to be a traveling acupuncture specialist.

506
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,090
It really is.

507
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:29,330
I need to like stop allowing like, home visits.

508
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:30,430
I guess there's...

509
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:37,530
I really need to like stop allowing home visits for like acupuncture massages.

510
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,410
I really need to stop that.

511
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:40,370
Oh wait, is this sand?

512
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:43,530
Is it a sand...

513
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,030
a sand colossal?

514
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,070
Where is it?

515
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:49,130
Okay, it's this way?

516
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:50,050
Alright.

517
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:52,010
Alright.

518
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:54,210
I don't know.

519
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,350
I don't trust like...

520
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:56,610
I don't know.

521
00:24:56,710 --> 00:25:03,750
I feel like when you're like a specialist that just travels to like... travels to people's homes for your thing.

522
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:04,990
It's so risky.

523
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,410
What if you get murdered?

524
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:09,870
Like that sounds so fucking risky.

525
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:13,710
You don't know where they come from.

526
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,330
You know where they come from.

527
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:17,110
I love sand.

528
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:18,150
I hate sand.

529
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:20,030
This has to be it.

530
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,110
Is this it?

531
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:24,590
That's just a...

532
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:27,130
That's just a rock.

533
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:30,110
Where the fuck does this guy live?

534
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:36,190
Where the fuck do you live?

535
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:37,110
Sir?

536
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:38,790
Here?

537
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:40,430
Underground?

538
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:44,210
Where the fuck is here?

539
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:46,970
Oh, oh.

540
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:47,490
Here, here, here.

541
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:48,730
Okay.

542
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:49,350
Get off.

543
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:50,670
Alright.

544
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:51,130
Here you go.

545
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:53,230
He has to live here.

546
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,470
There's no other way.

547
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:59,090
It has to be here.

548
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,030
Alright.

549
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:03,030
I figured it out.

550
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:05,410
He's underneath.

551
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,310
He's underground.

552
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:07,730
Climb.

553
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:09,050
Wait.

554
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:09,570
Crouch?

555
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:11,210
Crouch?

556
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:12,530
Crouch?

557
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:14,090
I know you can crouch.

558
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:17,830
Oh, that's all?

559
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:18,670
Okay, never mind.

560
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:21,230
Apparently, I don't know how to crouch.

561
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,230
I was wrong.

562
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:29,110
He definitely did not know how to crouch.

563
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:30,510
Weeeee.

564
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,050
Alright.

565
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:36,410
Time to go to my next appointment.

566
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:38,330
Hello, sir.

567
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:41,650
Your acupuncture specialist is here.

568
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,640
Don't worry.

569
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:49,260
My rates are very reasonable.

570
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:53,140
I'll be five out of five stars on Yelp.

571
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,840
I would die if I...

572
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,180
Oh my God.

573
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,540
Oh my God.

574
00:26:59,580 --> 00:26:59,840
No!

575
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,340
Why didn't they stop me?

576
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,960
Oh, fuck.

577
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:05,420
Okay.

578
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,380
We're gonna...

579
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:13,030
Oh, my God.

580
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:14,470
Oh, my God.

581
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:16,690
Oh, whoa.

582
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:18,450
Yay.

583
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:21,090
I'm so sorry.

584
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:24,750
I actually thought I was gonna die.

585
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:27,010
I legitimately thought I was gonna die.

586
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,170
Thank God.

587
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:32,230
Thank God, Woz.

588
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:34,410
But Woz saved my life.

589
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:36,770
Alright, what do you look like?

590
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:38,330
Don't worry, sir.

591
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:39,850
Where does it...

592
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:41,370
Where is all your stress?

593
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,450
Oh my God.

594
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:43,910
He big.

595
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:46,010
Is that a gorilla?

596
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:47,830
With a beard?

597
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:51,650
Is it monkey?

598
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:57,110
Oh, it's a brother?

599
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:59,710
Your brother's not...

600
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:01,950
Your brother is so fucking alive, sir.

601
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:03,870
Okay.

602
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:04,730
Where do I...

603
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:05,050
Oh.

604
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:07,870
Do I go here?

605
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,590
Where are these...

606
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:13,930
Where are these fucking...

607
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:14,990
Woz?

608
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:17,550
Oh, yep.

609
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:17,950
Alright.

610
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:18,310
Alright.

611
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:18,750
I'm sorry.

612
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:19,690
I'm so sorry.

613
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:23,550
Oh my God.

614
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:24,830
Oh my God.

615
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:26,410
How did you walk that fast?

616
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:27,410
You were so bow.

617
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:28,730
What?

618
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:33,210
You just jumped like 2 miles away from me.

619
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:35,050
How does that...

620
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:36,330
How did I get hurt?

621
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:37,750
Like, what?

622
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:40,390
Alright, here I go.

623
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:41,970
Here I go.

624
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:46,350
I don't know how he's suddenly so fucking fast, but here I go.

625
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:47,830
Weeeeee!

626
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:50,010
Okay.

627
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:51,910
Okay, now I don't know.

628
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:52,970
Now I don't know.

629
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:53,830
What do I do?

630
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:54,930
What do I do?

631
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:58,870
I'm like a little rat.

632
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:00,670
Hello, sir.

633
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:01,950
Hello.

634
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:02,670
Please.

635
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:05,030
Your brother really liked it.

636
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:06,650
He's totally very much alive.

637
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:10,110
He just didn't call you because he's just so fucking relaxed.

638
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:11,410
Okay?

639
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:14,750
He just didn't call you because he was just so relaxed, sir!

640
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:18,550
What's he gonna do?

641
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:19,370
Hit me?

642
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:21,610
He doesn't know what to do.

643
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:22,690
He's just looking at me.

644
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:24,350
What's he gonna do?

645
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,550
He's just walking around.

646
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:27,190
Hello.

647
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:28,870
Yay!

648
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:32,890
I don't know.

649
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:36,130
Is he gonna come closer?

650
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:37,450
Hello?

651
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:41,090
We'll grab your beard!

652
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:41,730
We'll grab your beard!

653
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:43,250
Ah!

654
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:46,550
Sir, you need to trim your fucking beard, sir.

655
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:46,890
Sir, you need to trim your fucking beard, sir.

656
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:48,670
I actually have no idea where the weak point is.

657
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:49,470
I did not pay...

658
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:50,050
Oh, it's on the head!

659
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:51,170
It's always on the head!

660
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:52,450
Because you're always stressed in the head.

661
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:53,730
Don't worry!

662
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:58,010
I'm here!

663
00:29:59,190 --> 00:29:59,830
Oh, god.

664
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:00,570
Oh, god.

665
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:01,410
Oh, god.

666
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:03,890
The specialist is here.

667
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:08,710
I need a re- Oh, oh.

668
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:10,550
My god.

669
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:12,770
Please do not resist!

670
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:16,630
Do not resist, sir!

671
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:18,110
Do not resist, sir!

672
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:18,770
It is for...

673
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:20,370
Do you wanna live long?

674
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:26,350
If you wanna live long and prosper, you gotta take this!

675
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:27,730
Boom!

676
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:28,650
There you go.

677
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:30,750
I really... I need to like chill a little bit.

678
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:32,670
No, wait.

679
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:33,430
That's just the oil!

680
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:34,950
It's called stress oil!

681
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:38,610
Trust the process!

682
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:40,730
It's called stress oil!

683
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:43,950
It's not blood!

684
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:45,330
It might look like blood!

685
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:49,070
But it's just all the excess oil in your head!

686
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:51,350
Because you're thinking too much, sir!

687
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:57,330
You are just thinking too much!

688
00:30:58,450 --> 00:30:59,530
Alright, there you go.

689
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:01,790
I need to figure out where the other one is.

690
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:06,850
I'm going to go to the...

691
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:08,470
Okay, I need to figure out where the other one is.

692
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:15,790
Don't worry, I'm a fucking licensed professional.

693
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:17,830
I got my license online.

694
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:20,290
That's when you know I'm professional.

695
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:25,750
I'm going to assume it's the back.

696
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:27,350
I'm going to assume.

697
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:31,130
Like all toxic.

698
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:33,170
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

699
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:33,830
Whoa.

700
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:34,910
Whoa.

701
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:36,350
Please.

702
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:39,310
Okay, I'm going to assume it's back here.

703
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,090
Oh, my God.

704
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:41,910
I fucking knew it.

705
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:44,030
Only a professional would know this.

706
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:49,690
I fucking knew it.

707
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:50,330
Don't worry.

708
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:55,110
A licensed professional knows where all the toxic is.

709
00:31:58,170 --> 00:31:59,210
Oh, no.

710
00:31:59,310 --> 00:31:59,550
Fuck.

711
00:31:59,570 --> 00:31:59,830
Okay.

712
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:00,590
This is going to be bad.

713
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:01,110
This is going to be bad.

714
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:02,650
Please stop shaking, sir.

715
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:03,450
Please stop shaking.

716
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:07,770
You have like... I can feel the toxic energy right here.

717
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:13,850
You have really bad back acne, sir.

718
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:15,290
Don't worry.

719
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:19,130
I think the hardest part was literally trying to find your house, sir.

720
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:21,350
Like you need a better address, man.

721
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:23,750
Like you need a mailbox outside.

722
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:26,530
How would people deliver your mail?

723
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:27,850
Please!

724
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:30,370
Look at all these stress juice!

725
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:35,510
There you go.

726
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:36,130
We did it.

727
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:41,230
Look at all that oil coming out of his body.

728
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,710
He sure used it.

729
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:45,850
Let the impurities... Yes!

730
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:47,030
It's the black acne!

731
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:51,250
Okay, I don't know if it's like an Asian parents thing.

732
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:53,390
But like I know... Oh god.

733
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:54,710
Sorry, the black ac... No!

734
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:58,770
The black acne on my... It's got me.

735
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,330
So like...

736
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:04,050
I don't know if this is an Asian parents thing or just a regular parents thing.

737
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:05,130
But like...

738
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:07,330
When you're growing up, your mom would...

739
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:09,610
My mom would always like talk about the...

740
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:10,250
What is it called?

741
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:10,930
The like...

742
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:13,850
The black oil on your nose and stuff.

743
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:14,790
And like...

744
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:17,270
Like she would like try to squeeze the...

745
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:18,770
She would like...

746
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:20,190
Be like, no you have...

747
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:22,550
There's so much black oil on your nose!

748
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:28,450
She always gives me like these things to put...

749
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:29,390
Yeah, the blackhead.

750
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:29,690
Yeah!

751
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:29,970
Yeah!

752
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:34,390
My mom would always talk about the blackheads and stuff on my nose.

753
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:35,250
And like...

754
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:36,390
Like when I get them.

755
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:38,610
She's like, no you have to fucking...

756
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:40,370
Squeeze it.

757
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:41,790
I'm like, okay, I don't think...

758
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:46,930
I don't think squeezing is the right thing to do.

759
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:56,290
It's actually bad.

760
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:57,270
Yeah.

761
00:33:57,690 --> 00:33:58,650
I was like...

762
00:33:58,650 --> 00:33:59,770
And then later on...

763
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:00,950
In life I was like...

764
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:02,930
Oh my god, wait you be squeezing...

765
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:07,250
Squeezing is actually really bad for your fucking skin?

766
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:08,910
Who would've thought?

767
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,260
I did it.

768
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,620
Another happy customer.

769
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,380
Yeah, you need like a fucking...

770
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:26,860
Those like...

771
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:29,000
Fucking tape stuff for your nose.

772
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,260
You get like blackheads.

773
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,120
Don't worry.

774
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,040
I'm here to squeeze the giant's nose...

775
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,380
For their blackhead treatment.

776
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:38,880
Alright.

777
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:39,760
Yeah, you can leave scars.

778
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:40,620
Yeah.

779
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,360
I wish little Doki knew about...

780
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,360
No, I don't have scars on my nose by the way.

781
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,700
I don't have scars on my nose.

782
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,640
But it definitely did not help my skin.

783
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:52,600
Definitely.

784
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:56,480
It definitely did not help my skin.

785
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:58,420
By squeezing the black...

786
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,640
The blackheads out.

787
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,280
Alright.

788
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,180
It's time to save.

789
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:03,840
Pray to save.

790
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:05,340
Yay!

791
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,220
Another happy customer.

792
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,600
Pray to save.

793
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:10,620
Pray.

794
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,080
Pray.

795
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:14,820
Nice.

796
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:17,140
Right.

797
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,860
Where's the other one?

798
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,280
Okay.

799
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,820
Oh my god, is it the sand time?

800
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,060
Okay.

801
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,040
No it's not sand time, cause it's in the opposite direction.

802
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:27,020
Nevermind.

803
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:28,600
Alright.

804
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:28,960
Alright.

805
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,860
It's not sand time because it's in the opposite direction.

806
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,380
Alright, here we go.

807
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,080
I also don't know how to fucking turn on this horse.

808
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,180
It's lake time?

809
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,320
It's lake time?

810
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,580
I thought it was sand time.

811
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,200
You guys were like the sand snake.

812
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,100
Okay, this way.

813
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,740
I just have to go straight.

814
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:52,860
Straight time.

815
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:53,880
Yeah!

816
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,620
Alright, here we go.

817
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,680
It's this way.

818
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,800
Is this the lake?

819
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,960
Oh my god, do you remember the lake?

820
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,380
Hey Arlo, do you remember?

821
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:14,620
Do you remember the happy times we had in that?

822
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,380
Alright, we have to figure out how to get down.

823
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,540
I actually don't remember how to get down from the lake.

824
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,800
How do I get down from here?

825
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,640
How the fuck?

826
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,860
Where the fuck is the ladder?

827
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,740
Where is the ladder?

828
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,240
Is it through this bridge?

829
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,400
Just jump.

830
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,040
Guys, no.

831
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,540
I know we can't just jump.

832
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:44,300
We've tested that theory before.

833
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:45,920
Is that bridge?

834
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,280
Is that a bridge?

835
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,740
No, that's not a bridge.

836
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,560
Is that a bridge?

837
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,240
I can't tell.

838
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,780
It's just fucking there.

839
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,240
Oh, it's the wrong way?

840
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:55,640
Okay.

841
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,880
God, I'm so directionless.

842
00:36:59,040 --> 00:36:59,740
Oh my god.

843
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,460
Thank god I was born in a time when GPS exists.

844
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,640
Like, thank god.

845
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,740
Please, Arlo!

846
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,380
Turn around!

847
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:09,580
There you go.

848
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:09,920
Thank you.

849
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:10,780
Thank you.

850
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,160
Alright.

851
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,260
I'm happy.

852
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:21,720
I know people are like, would you rather be born like 50 years ago or like in the past or 50 years in the future?

853
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,200
I think I like where I'm currently at.

854
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,100
Maybe like a little bit.

855
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:28,400
Maybe I wish I was born like a little bit.

856
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,220
Um...

857
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:33,040
Did I just go back the same way?

858
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,100
No.

859
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:38,380
No?

860
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:39,260
Oh, fuck it.

861
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,680
We'll figure it out later.

862
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,240
I don't think I did, right?

863
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,740
I don't know if... did I just went back the same way?

864
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,340
I can't tell.

865
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:51,620
I can't.

866
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,240
It's under.

867
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,180
It's like the lake is below me.

868
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,300
I know the lake is... this is the lake.

869
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:01,560
Yeah.

870
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,700
This is the lake.

871
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,760
Is this a lake or is this an ocean?

872
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,660
I'll never know.

873
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,420
This has to be the lake.

874
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:08,860
Okay.

875
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,260
I do sometimes wish... wait, no.

876
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,940
Wait, is this a lake or an ocean?

877
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,100
This is an ocean.

878
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:18,940
There's a lake?

879
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:22,960
It's all...

880
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,120
It's all water!

881
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:25,800
Yeah!

882
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,300
How am I supposed to tell?

883
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,460
They're all the same!

884
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,180
It's just water.

885
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,140
Oh my god.

886
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:37,400
I have... I don't think I'm meant to ride horses.

887
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:38,540
Please.

888
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:40,280
Please.

889
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,860
Yeah, I'm definitely not meant to ride horses.

890
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,260
But you know how people... Okay, this is not the right way.

891
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:53,160
People are like, oh, would you rather be born 50 years ahead?

892
00:38:53,160 --> 00:39:00,100
I wish I was born maybe like... maybe like 10 years... maybe like 5 years in advance.

893
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:06,720
Because like I was... so then I can like be more of a... I can be like full-on zoomer.

894
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:14,080
But with like... but with like... with like more FPS skills.

895
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:19,860
Sorry.

896
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:20,720
Sorry.

897
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,900
I could grow up longer playing video games.

898
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:23,300
Please.

899
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,500
Is this a lake?

900
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,400
The sword keeps pointing down.

901
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,300
How the fuck do I go down?

902
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:36,220
Is that a lake?

903
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,700
Or is... or is it the lake behind me?

904
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:46,390
Is that a lake?

905
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:50,830
No, I... because I've been there.

906
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:52,890
That's where I killed the other Colossus.

907
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:56,030
Okay.

908
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:57,470
Lake.

909
00:39:57,970 --> 00:39:59,150
Follow the path?

910
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:01,010
The path says down!

911
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:04,890
But then I've already been to that Colossus!

912
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:07,430
Where the fuck's the lake?

913
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:10,750
Because like I was there already!

914
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:13,170
Alright, I guess we'll do this again?

915
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:18,190
I hate going over here because there's no fucking light.

916
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:22,230
There's like no light at all here.

917
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:26,410
So I just have to rely on like pure instinct and I don't have that.

918
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:31,390
Also, I don't want to be born like... like back.

919
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:35,870
I'd rather be born ahead but not too ahead because I'm scared of global war.

920
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:36,390
What?

921
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:44,390
Not too ahead because I think we sort of fucked up the planet.

922
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:46,050
I'm not sure yet though.

923
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:50,670
And I don't want to... I don't want to be born too ahead to find out.

924
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:50,990
What?

925
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:01,790
I don't want to like find out.

926
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:07,610
I think we sort of... I don't know.

927
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:09,390
I don't know.

928
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:13,250
Judging by what the weather's like currently... I don't know.

929
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:20,330
Also, if I was born too far back in the past...

930
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:21,770
There's no... there's no internet.

931
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:24,750
And I don't know how to survive...

932
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:27,010
Well, to be fair, if I didn't grow up with the internet...

933
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:30,570
I wouldn't have to worry about like not knowing how to survive without it.

934
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:32,170
But like... oh my god.

935
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:33,790
I'd have to get a...

936
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:37,790
If it weren't for the internet...

937
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:39,830
I'd have to get a real job.

938
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:44,930
Where are you going?

939
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:47,450
Try to fucking figure out if this is the lake.

940
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:49,510
Is this the lake?

941
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:50,890
Are you a lake, sir?

942
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:53,350
There's no way because I killed a colossi up here.

943
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:58,130
Where the fuck... where's the lake?

944
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:00,050
There's so many bodies of water!

945
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:02,350
Is this lake?

946
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:07,370
We're muster.

947
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:10,010
Muster where?

948
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:14,990
Keep going?

949
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:16,170
Okay, I'll go this way.

950
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:18,470
Arlo, get over here.

951
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:20,350
Arlo!

952
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:21,830
Arlo!

953
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:24,820
Should I go this way?

954
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:25,640
It's further north.

955
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:26,420
I don't know.

956
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,160
Am I going north?

957
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,100
Guys, there's no compass.

958
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:29,200
Am I...

959
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:32,760
Oh my god.

960
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,800
Where's my phone app to tell me where I am?

961
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,940
Where's my... bro, I'll even take Apple Maps at this point.

962
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,320
That's how desperate I am.

963
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:46,060
I'm so desperate I'll even use... I'll even use Apple Maps.

964
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,440
You have a map?

965
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:49,980
Does this map look fucking...

966
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:53,220
Does this map look like it's readable?

967
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:55,940
It doesn't tell me where lake is.

968
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,680
There's no...

969
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,080
My GPS doesn't even work!

970
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,900
This is a shitty GPS because I require the fucking sun!

971
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,580
It's a solar powered sword!

972
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,920
It's literally a solar powered sword.

973
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:18,140
I don't know what to tell you.

974
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:19,420
Okay.

975
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:21,420
Alright, solar powered sword.

976
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:21,580
My power.

977
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:22,940
Where am I?

978
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:24,980
Where the fuck am I?

979
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:26,880
Lake?

980
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,060
Are you a lake?

981
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:30,300
Okay, wait.

982
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:31,340
There's a sun over here.

983
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:32,520
Oh my god.

984
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,260
There's a sun.

985
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:34,260
Okay.

986
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:35,960
Lake time.

987
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:38,840
Okay, sword.

988
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:39,740
Tell me where to go.

989
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:44,590
This way.

990
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:45,890
Okay, this way.

991
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:47,410
Alright, I figured it out!

992
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:49,630
My sword!

993
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:53,350
My solar powered GPS tells me to go this way!

994
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:57,030
Oh my god, the reception here is fucking terrible.

995
00:43:57,670 --> 00:43:59,870
Everything I do for my dead girlfriend.

996
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:02,610
Okay, there better be like...

997
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:08,850
Okay, she better not fucking cheat on me after saving her fucking life.

998
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:09,650
I swear to god.

999
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:11,630
I swear to fucking god.

1000
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:15,170
If she leaves me...

1001
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:20,270
If she fucking leaves me after I killed 15 colossi for her...

1002
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:22,110
I swear to fucking god.

1003
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:28,250
I swear to fucking god.

1004
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:31,070
I'm going through so much just to fucking save her life.

1005
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:33,930
Okay.

1006
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:36,310
No, no GPS.

1007
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:38,450
Where am I?

1008
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:40,850
Where the fuck am I?

1009
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:42,390
There is no water anywhere.

1010
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:44,230
Where am I?

1011
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:46,070
Where am I?

1012
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:49,050
Oh god, I'm so lost.

1013
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:51,550
What the fuck is this?

1014
00:44:56,990 --> 00:44:58,950
I don't know, do you know where lake is?

1015
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:02,410
No?

1016
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:03,790
Not... maybe this way?

1017
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:06,210
This way seems like a lakey area.

1018
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:11,950
This... is this... is this a... is this...

1019
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:13,850
Is this a lakey area?

1020
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:16,730
Bro, I'm desperate.

1021
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:17,830
I'm using my legs.

1022
00:45:20,110 --> 00:45:21,910
This is how desperate I am.

1023
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:23,970
I'm actually using my fucking legs.

1024
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:30,130
Oh my god, someone give me the fucking sun.

1025
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:33,390
Lake...

1026
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:35,170
Lake, where are you?

1027
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,090
Where's water?

1028
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:40,350
Why is there so many lakes here?

1029
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:43,070
We gotta industrialize this area.

1030
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:49,770
We gotta make this a city so I don't have to deal with all these lakes.

1031
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:50,810
Is that shrine?

1032
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:51,890
No, those are just ruins.

1033
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:52,010
Just rocks.

1034
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:55,310
Where's the sun?

1035
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:57,530
Where the fuck's the sun?

1036
00:45:57,890 --> 00:45:59,790
I think I'm going the right area?

1037
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:02,550
Alright, I'm gonna trust you on this, boy.

1038
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:04,590
I'm gonna trust you.

1039
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:08,470
I'm gonna follow my heart.

1040
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:12,150
My heart tells me that this is where the lake is.

1041
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:16,110
If there's no lake here, I'm gonna make my own fucking lake.

1042
00:46:17,290 --> 00:46:18,750
Is this another area?

1043
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:20,710
What the fuck?

1044
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:23,650
Alright.

1045
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:25,830
Me down this path.

1046
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:27,190
There's a lake.

1047
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:32,170
Maybe down this path, there's the lake I'm looking for.

1048
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:33,570
And then...

1049
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:35,410
Or the sun, you know.

1050
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:36,270
I'll take either.

1051
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:37,470
I'll take the fucking GPS.

1052
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:39,590
My solar powered GPS.

1053
00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:40,710
Wait, wait, wait!

1054
00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:42,050
Oh my god.

1055
00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:43,770
Solar powered GPS.

1056
00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:48,730
Poodoo!

1057
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:51,810
But...

1058
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:54,430
Guys...

1059
00:46:54,430 --> 00:46:56,970
How the fuck do I get over there?

1060
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:00,990
Did I go the wrong way?

1061
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:03,970
Did I...

1062
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:05,350
Did I...

1063
00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:07,610
No, I must not have.

1064
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:09,590
No, this has to be the right way!

1065
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:11,730
There's no...

1066
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:13,590
How do I get over to the other side?

1067
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:16,710
There's no way.

1068
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:20,510
No...

1069
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:22,010
There's no way.

1070
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:23,090
This has to be.

1071
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:24,990
There's no other path.

1072
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:27,550
That's literally the only path I have.

1073
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:29,130
It's heading...

1074
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:29,530
Wait.

1075
00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:34,290
It's heading further and further away from where my sword was gonna ask me to go.

1076
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:35,410
But like...

1077
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:36,610
It has to be.

1078
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:39,450
It has to like miraculously turn right.

1079
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:40,950
Like...

1080
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:41,950
Please.

1081
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:46,570
I'm so sorry.

1082
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:47,790
Oh my god.

1083
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:48,270
Please.

1084
00:47:48,610 --> 00:47:49,270
Please.

1085
00:47:49,310 --> 00:47:52,610
It hasn't miraculously turned right.

1086
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:57,510
Oh no.

1087
00:47:57,630 --> 00:47:58,910
Where am I?

1088
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:00,770
Where am I?

1089
00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:02,810
Where is this place?

1090
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:06,410
Riding a horse don't turn the six...

1091
00:48:06,410 --> 00:48:08,710
He travels automatic through these paths.

1092
00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:09,390
Oh he does?

1093
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:11,010
Wait.

1094
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:11,670
Does he?

1095
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:14,030
Oh my god!

1096
00:48:14,030 --> 00:48:16,690
He moves on his own!

1097
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:17,910
Oh my god.

1098
00:48:17,950 --> 00:48:19,010
Thank you for the super chat.

1099
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:20,610
Oh my god.

1100
00:48:20,770 --> 00:48:22,090
Everything changed.

1101
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:25,610
This entire game changed for me.

1102
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:27,870
I literally don't have to move.

1103
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:30,630
He can move for me.

1104
00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:33,830
Guys, I think I went the wrong way guys.

1105
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:35,830
Yeah, I'm...

1106
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:37,850
I'm pretty sure I went the wrong way.

1107
00:48:43,010 --> 00:48:44,530
No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1108
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:46,050
I'm heading to a new area.

1109
00:48:46,070 --> 00:48:46,230
I'm going to a new path.

1110
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:48,830
I'm going to a new area.

1111
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:50,870
Oh wait, I'm going up.

1112
00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:52,430
This might be where the lake is.

1113
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:55,210
Oh my god.

1114
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:56,850
Arlo knows where to go.

1115
00:48:57,450 --> 00:48:58,210
Okay, GPS.

1116
00:48:58,430 --> 00:48:59,250
Where do I go, GPS?

1117
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:03,710
Where do I fucking go?

1118
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:06,250
Did I go the wrong way?

1119
00:49:07,790 --> 00:49:08,590
Do I...

1120
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:12,550
Is it like maybe...

1121
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:14,710
Okay, guys, guys.

1122
00:49:16,070 --> 00:49:16,190
I'm going to go forward.

1123
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:19,510
Maybe...

1124
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:21,250
Maybe the lake is a sky lake.

1125
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:22,610
Maybe...

1126
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:31,230
Guys, maybe...

1127
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:33,150
Guys, which way...

1128
00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:34,390
Which way?

1129
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:35,150
Right or left?

1130
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:40,620
Guys, right or left?

1131
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:41,320
Guys...

1132
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:44,060
This is left and this is right.

1133
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:46,840
Left?

1134
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:47,180
Okay.

1135
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,660
Guys, maybe it's a sky lake.

1136
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:51,960
Guys, maybe...

1137
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:52,860
Maybe...

1138
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,000
Maybe the lake is in the sky.

1139
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:57,460
You don't know that.

1140
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:00,000
Alright.

1141
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,260
This has to be the lake.

1142
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:03,360
There's no other explanation.

1143
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,060
There's no other explanation.

1144
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:07,340
There's no other explanation.

1145
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:10,300
This has to be where the lake is.

1146
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:12,880
Right?

1147
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:14,260
Right?

1148
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:14,700
Right?

1149
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:16,740
There's no way.

1150
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:17,780
Arlo knows.

1151
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:19,700
Arlo, you know, right?

1152
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,240
I trust in him.

1153
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,300
I trust in this GPS powers.

1154
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:27,140
Okay, let's just...

1155
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:28,900
You...

1156
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:32,480
Guys...

1157
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:34,680
Guys...

1158
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:41,240
Bruh...

1159
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,100
Guys, I don't think...

1160
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,760
Guys, I don't think...

1161
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:47,780
Guys, I don't think I'm at the right path.

1162
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:50,180
Guys, I don't think I'm at the right path.

1163
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:50,900
For some reason...

1164
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:53,640
I have a feeling I'm definitely...

1165
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,260
I'm definitely not going the right way.

1166
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:56,600
I'm definitely not going the right way.

1167
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:57,880
I don't know.

1168
00:50:58,280 --> 00:50:59,340
I don't know.

1169
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:01,160
Oh, wait!

1170
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:01,940
Unless...

1171
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:03,620
Unless...

1172
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:04,640
Wait!

1173
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:06,820
Arlo!

1174
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:09,420
Oh my god!

1175
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,480
Unless this is a lake!

1176
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:12,600
I think I've...

1177
00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:17,710
Guys, I knew it!

1178
00:51:17,830 --> 00:51:19,850
You have to go up...

1179
00:51:19,850 --> 00:51:21,110
to go down!

1180
00:51:21,850 --> 00:51:22,690
This is it!

1181
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:28,020
I fucking... Oh, I got a shrine too.

1182
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:29,680
This is it.

1183
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:31,720
I found the... I found the shrine.

1184
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:34,720
This is almost like a lake.

1185
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:35,920
Okay, have I been here?

1186
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:37,780
Have I been to the shrine before?

1187
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,080
No, because this is the first time prayed.

1188
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:40,680
No, wait.

1189
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:41,900
Wait, no.

1190
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,020
I've been to the shrine before.

1191
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:44,260
Wait.

1192
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,640
No, this is the one of the two shrines...

1193
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:47,260
I've been to.

1194
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,900
Oh my god!

1195
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:53,700
I've been here before!

1196
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,000
I've been here before!

1197
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:58,820
Oh my god!

1198
00:51:59,120 --> 00:51:59,280
Oh my god!

1199
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,580
Guys, I've been to the shrine before.

1200
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:02,660
Alright.

1201
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:03,660
Okay.

1202
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:05,160
It's okay.

1203
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:08,020
This has to be where the lake is now.

1204
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:09,780
Alright, the lake...

1205
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:11,480
The lake is this way.

1206
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:13,840
This has to be the lake.

1207
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:15,860
There's no...

1208
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:17,340
How do I get over this?

1209
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:20,220
It has to be over this platform.

1210
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:22,840
It has to be over this platform.

1211
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:23,200
Alright.

1212
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:24,900
Beyond the shrine.

1213
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:25,680
So down here.

1214
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:26,780
Okay.

1215
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:28,640
Just keep going.

1216
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:31,740
Alright, this has to...

1217
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:32,800
Wait, did I come from here?

1218
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:35,360
Wait, did I...

1219
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,520
No, no, I didn't.

1220
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:37,460
Okay.

1221
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:40,300
Wait, can I climb that?

1222
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:42,280
Oh, I can?

1223
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:43,920
Alright.

1224
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:44,080
Alright.

1225
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:47,840
Okay, I can climb it.

1226
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:48,080
Okay.

1227
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:49,100
Alright.

1228
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:49,920
This is it.

1229
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:50,920
This is it.

1230
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:51,720
I figured it out.

1231
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:52,880
I did not look at chat.

1232
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,840
I figured it out with my own fucking intuition.

1233
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:01,380
This is it.

1234
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:03,660
I figured it out, Arlo.

1235
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:05,880
With my own intuition.

1236
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:08,240
Okay, how do I get up?

1237
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:08,540
Okay.

1238
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:09,300
Jump.

1239
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,540
Guys, I can't climb this.

1240
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:12,700
I can't.

1241
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:13,160
Fucking...

1242
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:19,940
Guys, who the fuck said I can climb this?

1243
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:23,680
Guys, who the fuck said I can climb this?

1244
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,120
Guys, I lied.

1245
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:26,780
I read chat.

1246
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:28,540
And the chat fucking lied.

1247
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:31,420
Chat fucking lied.

1248
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:34,240
I did not get two guides.

1249
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:36,060
I did not get one guide.

1250
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:37,140
I did not get two guides.

1251
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:38,880
I get like several guides.

1252
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:42,400
I fucking saw like four different people that told me to climb this.

1253
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:43,900
I saw like four different people that told me to climb this.

1254
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:47,960
I literally saw four different people that said you should climb it.

1255
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:50,680
And I was like, oh my god, I figured it out.

1256
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:52,680
Where's Arlo going?

1257
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:55,000
Arlo, where are you going?

1258
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:56,280
I need you to go this path.

1259
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:00,280
Okay, maybe it's this way, right?

1260
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:03,060
Where did I come from again?

1261
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:06,420
I came from the top, so it has to be...

1262
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:08,520
Wait, where did I come from?

1263
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:10,360
Where did I...

1264
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:14,500
Here.

1265
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,000
I did not come from here.

1266
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:18,140
Yeah.

1267
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:19,940
Here.

1268
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:24,680
Alright, this is where I didn't come from.

1269
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:28,420
So the lake should be down there.

1270
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:33,040
It should be left side, because that's where the thing is.

1271
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:34,540
Right?

1272
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:36,220
It should be left.

1273
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:37,900
This is where the lake should be.

1274
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:42,440
Oh my god, I'm so f***ing lost.

1275
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:47,760
This has to be where the lake is.

1276
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:50,740
Because the thing was like, go left.

1277
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:53,740
Oh no, where's the GPS telling me?

1278
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,460
No, I'm going back in the same area.

1279
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:59,080
I'm going... I'm going around again.

1280
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:04,760
No, where's the GPS?

1281
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:10,040
Oh, go right.

1282
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:10,540
Okay.

1283
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:12,300
I go right.

1284
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:13,160
Okay, this way.

1285
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:15,740
Alright, I turned around.

1286
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:18,960
Apparently the last time I went left.

1287
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:20,640
Now I go right.

1288
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:23,320
This is where lake is.

1289
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:25,120
Lake.

1290
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:31,740
How do you guys remember where the f*** the lake is?

1291
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:33,940
Sleepy, I left for a meeting.

1292
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:36,800
Are we still looking for the lake?

1293
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:40,060
Sleepy, thank you for the super chat.

1294
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:40,660
Thank you.

1295
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:41,300
Thank you.

1296
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:41,400
Thank you.

1297
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:44,920
Wait, now it's sand.

1298
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:47,200
Why sand?

1299
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:50,500
Sand eventually leads to lake.

1300
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,660
Guys, if you guys didn't know.

1301
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:54,820
Sand becomes water.

1302
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:57,420
Because that's where sand comes from.

1303
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:58,900
Sand comes from like...

1304
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:01,820
The... the like erosion of rock.

1305
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:04,240
From water.

1306
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,640
This is where lake is.

1307
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:07,300
Right?

1308
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,200
Lake?

1309
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:13,240
Where is this?

1310
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:16,560
Is this the lake?

1311
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:18,980
Where the f*** do I get down?

1312
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:21,220
This is lake!

1313
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:23,740
Oh my god, this is lake.

1314
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,160
We made it.

1315
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:27,660
I told you.

1316
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:29,120
I told...

1317
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,500
I told you.

1318
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:36,440
Sand eventually becomes water.

1319
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:36,740
Water!

1320
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:41,340
By pure science!

1321
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:43,580
I f***ing knew it.

1322
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:45,760
I f***ing...

1323
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,240
I swear like...

1324
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:51,680
Majority of this gameplay is just me trying to figure out where the f*** things are.

1325
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:52,940
Alright.

1326
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:55,780
Okay, I thought I was gonna die from that.

1327
00:56:57,740 --> 00:56:59,480
How much... Oh my god.

1328
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:00,720
Oh f*** okay.

1329
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:02,700
Okay, not jumping anymore.

1330
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:04,640
I lost a lot of HP from that.

1331
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:07,540
Unless...

1332
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:08,120
Whoa!

1333
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:09,560
That's f***ing right.

1334
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:11,040
I'm gaming.

1335
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:12,920
Where is he?

1336
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:19,500
Panzer, thank you for the 20 ships!

1337
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:20,580
Thank you, thank you!

1338
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:23,500
Here we go.

1339
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:24,440
Oh, he's fish!

1340
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,180
Wait, electric fish.

1341
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:27,420
Does it hurt?

1342
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:32,440
I wonder if I touch...

1343
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:35,980
Man, I wonder if I touch the electricity in the water.

1344
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:37,360
Will it hurt?

1345
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:40,380
It's time to find out.

1346
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:41,860
F*** around and find out.

1347
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,320
Please don't f*** around and find out.

1348
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:46,660
Please don't.

1349
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:47,440
Alright.

1350
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:48,780
Here I go.

1351
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:51,560
Time to touch the...

1352
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:52,560
Touch the fish.

1353
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:55,060
Time to touch the fish!

1354
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,560
Sir, can I touch you?

1355
00:57:58,240 --> 00:57:59,860
Remember to ask permission.

1356
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:05,260
Sir, I am here for the appointment.

1357
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:06,680
Sir?

1358
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:07,340
I am here for the appointment.

1359
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:08,200
Do not worry.

1360
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,300
I am a professional.

1361
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:12,440
Sir.

1362
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,100
It's not gonna hurt.

1363
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:18,940
It's not gonna hurt when I give you your acupuncture, sir.

1364
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:24,540
It's all about getting rid of that tox... the dirty toxins in your body.

1365
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:26,320
How do I f***ing piss him off?

1366
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:29,220
Come on, come up.

1367
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:30,500
Look on the water.

1368
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:31,940
What the f***?

1369
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,040
Not like that.

1370
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:34,580
What the f***?

1371
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:35,520
Woah, woah.

1372
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:36,240
Woah.

1373
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:36,760
Woah.

1374
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:37,160
Woah.

1375
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:38,460
Where's the part...

1376
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:40,400
Where's the part where it doesn't do that?

1377
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:42,240
Oh!

1378
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:43,400
What?

1379
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:45,480
No, I missed out!

1380
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:47,540
I'm so confused!

1381
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:49,960
I missed out!

1382
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:53,800
I hear you.

1383
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,000
Don't worry, I figured it out.

1384
00:58:57,060 --> 00:58:58,660
I didn't know the tail...

1385
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,940
I didn't know I was like just the f***ing...

1386
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:03,620
I didn't know I was just out of reach from the tail, to be fair.

1387
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:04,780
Oh my god.

1388
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:06,140
I can't even get up on this.

1389
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:09,900
Where does he go back up to breathe air, apparently?

1390
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:11,260
Are you like a shark?

1391
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,420
Where you need to go back up to breathe air?

1392
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:15,600
Is that a...

1393
00:59:20,130 --> 00:59:20,970
You're not a fish.

1394
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:21,990
You're a fake fish.

1395
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:25,630
If you need to come back up for water, you're a f***ing fake fish.

1396
00:59:29,610 --> 00:59:31,070
Broko, thank you for the gift of ship.

1397
00:59:31,170 --> 00:59:31,430
Thank you.

1398
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:35,430
You need to come back to the surface.

1399
00:59:35,490 --> 00:59:36,730
You ain't a f***ing real fish.

1400
00:59:37,350 --> 00:59:39,030
You're a f***ing lie to society.

1401
00:59:40,890 --> 00:59:41,290
Alright.

1402
00:59:42,110 --> 00:59:43,270
Where is he swimming to?

1403
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:45,750
Where are you swimming to?

1404
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:51,020
Where the f*** is that?

1405
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:52,840
How the f*** do I get there?

1406
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:54,680
Like...

1407
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:56,700
Oh my god.

1408
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,480
Bro, how the f***...

1409
00:59:58,480 --> 00:59:59,200
Are you serious?

1410
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:01,300
Are you f***ing kidding me?

1411
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:01,640
Okay.

1412
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:02,720
This is it.

1413
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:04,240
This has to be the tail.

1414
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:05,960
Tail, tail, tail, tail.

1415
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:06,520
Go up, tail.

1416
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:07,660
Go up.

1417
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:08,820
Nice.

1418
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:09,660
That's what?

1419
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:15,300
It still didn't even go up.

1420
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:16,720
Yeah, I was thinking about dolphins.

1421
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:19,500
I am trying my best.

1422
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:23,220
He barely goes back up for water.

1423
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:24,200
Ow.

1424
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:28,820
Oh, oh, oh.

1425
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:29,440
I did it.

1426
01:00:29,740 --> 01:00:31,080
I f***ing did it.

1427
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:32,860
What do I do?

1428
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:38,220
I'm not even on the right side of history right now.

1429
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:41,780
Wait, where am I?

1430
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:43,900
Like, where am I?

1431
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:45,800
Where the f*** am I?

1432
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:46,460
Oh, there I am.

1433
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:47,860
How do I...

1434
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:48,960
How do I...

1435
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:49,980
I'm so...

1436
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:51,880
Please, please head back up.

1437
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:52,560
Please.

1438
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:54,180
I'm trying.

1439
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:56,040
I'm trying to cry.

1440
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:58,320
Oh, okay.

1441
01:00:58,420 --> 01:00:58,760
Here you go.

1442
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:00,220
I'm okay.

1443
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:00,560
I'm okay.

1444
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:00,940
I'm okay.

1445
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:01,300
I'm okay.

1446
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:02,360
Oh, no.

1447
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:02,840
Grab on.

1448
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:03,360
Grab on.

1449
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:03,700
Grab on.

1450
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:06,020
Grab on.

1451
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:06,460
Grab on.

1452
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:07,660
Okay.

1453
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:09,720
Silly dokey.

1454
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:10,960
You're always on the right side.

1455
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:19,180
Okay.

1456
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:19,940
Okay.

1457
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:20,220
We're...

1458
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:20,920
We're fine.

1459
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:28,080
Okay.

1460
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:30,720
We're fine.

1461
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:34,420
There we go.

1462
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:34,860
Okay.

1463
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:36,000
Don't worry!

1464
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:38,260
Oh my god!

1465
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:41,520
I can feel the stress on this muscle too!

1466
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:43,120
Don't worry!

1467
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:45,480
Look at all the stress juice!

1468
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:50,900
The more stress juice there is, the more you know I'm helping!

1469
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:58,200
Oh, it's already disabled?

1470
01:01:58,440 --> 01:01:59,320
Bro, I didn't know that.

1471
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:00,820
I was thinking... Whoa!

1472
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:03,040
Let me climb up here.

1473
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:05,060
Overkill Doki.

1474
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:09,300
It's the stress juice!

1475
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:10,540
You never heard of it?

1476
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:18,400
Guys, whenever you're super stressed out and you poke deep enough, all the stress juice comes out.

1477
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:19,840
Oh no.

1478
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:20,560
No!

1479
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:22,640
Okay.

1480
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:23,820
No.

1481
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:25,460
No, I'm drowning.

1482
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:27,360
Wait, I'm actually drowning.

1483
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:29,020
I forgot I have to breathe.

1484
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:35,000
Guys, did you know humans cannot breathe underwater?

1485
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:42,940
Did you guys know that?

1486
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:49,740
Fun fact, we were not meant... Fun fact guys, our lungs are not built to breathe underwater.

1487
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:51,940
Is that so fun?

1488
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:54,260
What?

1489
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:55,320
No way.

1490
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:56,000
I know!

1491
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:58,780
This game just taught me that.

1492
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:01,380
Humans can't breathe underwater!

1493
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:04,400
Science brought to you by Doki Bird.

1494
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:05,980
Mama Shiba.

1495
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:07,840
God, I love Mama Shiba.

1496
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:09,420
I used to watch that shit.

1497
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:13,620
I didn't like me... Like when I was little, I made a fucking like digital wallpaper of Mama Shiba.

1498
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,480
And I posted it on Tumblr.

1499
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:20,680
Yeah, ow.

1500
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:21,960
Yeah, that was me.

1501
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:24,080
Where's the tail?

1502
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:25,560
Grab.

1503
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:26,520
Alright.

1504
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:27,440
I grabbed.

1505
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:30,360
I love Mama Shiba.

1506
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:33,420
It's actually one of my favorite...

1507
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:37,020
One of my favorite animated shorts ever.

1508
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,620
I learned so many fun facts.

1509
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:41,840
It's how I became so fun.

1510
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:47,300
That's why I'm so fun, guys.

1511
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:48,760
I know all these fun facts.

1512
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:52,460
I just...

1513
01:03:52,860 --> 01:03:54,000
Nope, I can't.

1514
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:54,520
I can't let go.

1515
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:57,040
I need to wait until I resurface and then I can like run.

1516
01:03:58,100 --> 01:03:58,740
Oh God.

1517
01:03:58,840 --> 01:03:59,220
Oh God.

1518
01:03:59,300 --> 01:03:59,600
Okay.

1519
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:02,120
Bro, this sucks.

1520
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:03,120
Bro.

1521
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:04,360
Bro, this sucks.

1522
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:05,160
I have to get closer.

1523
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:06,980
Come on, just head up.

1524
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:07,920
Get over there.

1525
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:09,260
Get over there.

1526
01:04:09,660 --> 01:04:11,020
The Doki Special.

1527
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:13,440
The Doki Special is coming!

1528
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:15,620
Okay.

1529
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:16,780
This has to be it.

1530
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:20,160
Bro, that was like a tiny ass poke.

1531
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:22,980
Alright, there we go.

1532
01:04:23,380 --> 01:04:24,520
Oh my God.

1533
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:26,980
You gotta lay off on the electricity, man.

1534
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:29,820
It's all the fucking electricity.

1535
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:33,760
You're just getting more and more stressed out.

1536
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:37,580
Oh, I just... Oh, I disabled the electricity.

1537
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:39,340
Bro!

1538
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:46,560
It's because of all the electricity causing all the stress juice to build up.

1539
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,040
You gotta relax, bro.

1540
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:52,580
It's not good for you.

1541
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:55,140
Don't worry.

1542
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:56,660
I have a home remedy.

1543
01:04:58,880 --> 01:04:59,480
Guys.

1544
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:03,080
Guys, I'm 1 HP.

1545
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:09,620
Guys, I don't think he likes my home remedies, guys.

1546
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:11,100
I don't think...

1547
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:14,600
I didn't think he liked that.

1548
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:17,120
Oh, this is so bad.

1549
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:18,820
I'm like 1 HP right now.

1550
01:05:19,220 --> 01:05:19,740
Oh.

1551
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:22,140
Oh.

1552
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:23,940
Don't worry.

1553
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:26,160
I can like heal, right?

1554
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:29,040
Don't worry.

1555
01:05:29,980 --> 01:05:31,880
1 HP ain't so bad.

1556
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:35,520
Just don't get hit.

1557
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:36,160
Of course.

1558
01:05:36,620 --> 01:05:37,520
Just don't get hit.

1559
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:43,020
Do I... Can I like heal if I was just...

1560
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:45,900
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1561
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:48,860
Do I... Can I heal if I just like stand on somewhere?

1562
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:52,240
Is it because I'm swimming that I'm not self-healing?

1563
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:57,160
Alright, let's see.

1564
01:05:57,220 --> 01:05:58,240
I'm just gonna stand over there.

1565
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:00,640
Alright.

1566
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:01,500
Don't worry, sir.

1567
01:06:02,020 --> 01:06:02,940
I'll be right back.

1568
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:07,000
Alright.

1569
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:07,320
Alright.

1570
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:08,240
Am I self-healing?

1571
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:11,200
Why the fuck are you tired?

1572
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:15,000
Why are you tired?

1573
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:16,120
You little bitch.

1574
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:19,260
You're not allowed to be tired.

1575
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:21,760
It's all about satisfying the customer's demands.

1576
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:27,400
Then you can go home back to your one... back to your studio apartment.

1577
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:28,560
Hahaha.

1578
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:29,480
Hahaha.

1579
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:36,180
The customer is always right.

1580
01:06:42,230 --> 01:06:42,810
Look.

1581
01:06:43,190 --> 01:06:44,210
Oh, I have to crouch.

1582
01:06:44,390 --> 01:06:45,290
Oh, crouch to heal faster?

1583
01:06:45,610 --> 01:06:46,490
Oh, so smart.

1584
01:06:48,910 --> 01:06:50,630
Welcome to the service industry.

1585
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:54,770
Bro, this is getting too real.

1586
01:06:56,870 --> 01:06:59,350
Welcome to the service industry.

1587
01:07:00,150 --> 01:07:00,670
Hahaha.

1588
01:07:04,110 --> 01:07:06,150
This is the life we sign up for.

1589
01:07:08,730 --> 01:07:09,790
Come back up.

1590
01:07:10,190 --> 01:07:12,210
Come back up so I can grab your tail.

1591
01:07:12,710 --> 01:07:14,770
Sir, can I still grab your tail?

1592
01:07:15,510 --> 01:07:16,810
Sir, look at you!

1593
01:07:20,090 --> 01:07:22,590
I can see... Oh my god.

1594
01:07:22,670 --> 01:07:26,230
I can feel the stress aura from your fucking body.

1595
01:07:27,430 --> 01:07:28,370
From my home.

1596
01:07:28,510 --> 01:07:28,930
Don't worry.

1597
01:07:29,070 --> 01:07:30,390
You just need a crystal.

1598
01:07:32,570 --> 01:07:35,710
Can I recommend you a crystal for you to purchase?

1599
01:07:37,690 --> 01:07:38,950
Where the fuck is the tail?

1600
01:07:39,310 --> 01:07:39,550
Oh!

1601
01:07:40,090 --> 01:07:40,790
I missed.

1602
01:07:45,550 --> 01:07:47,110
Guys, there was the tail.

1603
01:07:47,690 --> 01:07:49,710
Can I recommend you some crystal healing?

1604
01:07:50,630 --> 01:07:51,990
Queen, thank you for the super chat.

1605
01:07:52,070 --> 01:07:52,650
Thank you, thank you.

1606
01:07:52,650 --> 01:07:54,410
Doctor, you want to cancel my appointment.

1607
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:55,450
Here's the refund.

1608
01:07:55,690 --> 01:07:56,150
Thank you.

1609
01:07:56,150 --> 01:07:57,170
Thank you for the super chat.

1610
01:07:57,410 --> 01:07:58,370
Thank you.

1611
01:07:58,550 --> 01:07:59,210
Don't worry.

1612
01:07:59,290 --> 01:08:00,410
I can grab on the second.

1613
01:08:02,050 --> 01:08:02,770
Don't worry.

1614
01:08:02,890 --> 01:08:03,950
No, he's just being shy.

1615
01:08:06,170 --> 01:08:09,310
He's just being shy because I'm like streaming my sessions.

1616
01:08:10,030 --> 01:08:12,530
You know those people that stream their actual job?

1617
01:08:12,750 --> 01:08:14,430
Like those convenience stores?

1618
01:08:14,750 --> 01:08:15,730
And like...

1619
01:08:16,770 --> 01:08:20,930
Like those convenience stores and stuff where they stream their jobs and stuff?

1620
01:08:21,190 --> 01:08:21,490
Sir!

1621
01:08:21,710 --> 01:08:26,090
I know like it wasn't in the fine print when you fucking bought my server.

1622
01:08:26,090 --> 01:08:27,410
But like...

1623
01:08:27,410 --> 01:08:28,190
There's a lot...

1624
01:08:28,190 --> 01:08:29,590
I have to also...

1625
01:08:29,590 --> 01:08:30,890
Look, I have bills to pay.

1626
01:08:35,030 --> 01:08:36,850
I have bills to pay.

1627
01:08:37,270 --> 01:08:37,790
Alright?

1628
01:08:37,870 --> 01:08:38,950
And I need the content.

1629
01:08:39,450 --> 01:08:40,530
So like...

1630
01:08:40,530 --> 01:08:43,530
I'm here to stream this acupuncture session.

1631
01:08:44,050 --> 01:08:47,850
You're violating patient confidentiality.

1632
01:08:47,930 --> 01:08:48,450
Look.

1633
01:08:48,690 --> 01:08:52,990
To violate doctor-patient confidentiality means that I actually have to be licensed.

1634
01:08:53,290 --> 01:08:54,230
Which I totally am.

1635
01:08:54,390 --> 01:08:55,410
Which I am, chat.

1636
01:08:58,570 --> 01:09:00,310
Which is totally true.

1637
01:09:01,830 --> 01:09:03,470
Alright, this has to be the tail.

1638
01:09:03,810 --> 01:09:05,010
Did I grab onto it?

1639
01:09:05,170 --> 01:09:05,830
Look, nice.

1640
01:09:08,030 --> 01:09:09,130
Alright, I grabbed the tail.

1641
01:09:09,750 --> 01:09:12,090
I firmly grasped the tail.

1642
01:09:14,690 --> 01:09:16,650
I totally am licensed, guys.

1643
01:09:16,810 --> 01:09:19,290
It's not like I learned from online YouTube videos.

1644
01:09:20,950 --> 01:09:23,150
But to be fair, like you know...

1645
01:09:23,770 --> 01:09:24,970
It doesn't hurt.

1646
01:09:24,970 --> 01:09:32,630
Like a person who learns from YouTube videos is just as valid as a person who learned professionally at school.

1647
01:09:38,770 --> 01:09:40,070
They are just the same.

1648
01:09:40,390 --> 01:09:41,630
This is only my...

1649
01:09:41,630 --> 01:09:45,630
This is like, you know, my opinion as someone who got my degree professionally.

1650
01:09:45,710 --> 01:09:46,750
Who licensed professionally.

1651
01:09:47,330 --> 01:09:48,290
But like...

1652
01:09:48,290 --> 01:09:52,430
I think personally, self-taught people are just...

1653
01:09:52,430 --> 01:09:53,390
Oh my god.

1654
01:09:53,470 --> 01:09:54,290
Okay, give me a second.

1655
01:09:54,970 --> 01:09:55,090
Like...

1656
01:09:55,090 --> 01:10:00,010
I personally think people who are self-taught are just as valid.

1657
01:10:02,950 --> 01:10:04,290
Please let me get closer.

1658
01:10:04,870 --> 01:10:05,350
Please.

1659
01:10:08,490 --> 01:10:09,270
Okay, there we go.

1660
01:10:09,510 --> 01:10:09,750
No!

1661
01:10:10,050 --> 01:10:10,490
Fuck!

1662
01:10:10,610 --> 01:10:11,230
Oh god!

1663
01:10:11,570 --> 01:10:12,490
I'll take it!

1664
01:10:13,030 --> 01:10:14,770
I'll take it for the content!

1665
01:10:16,050 --> 01:10:16,530
Phew!

1666
01:10:17,010 --> 01:10:17,750
There we go.

1667
01:10:19,430 --> 01:10:20,090
There we go.

1668
01:10:20,630 --> 01:10:21,550
Oh, thank god.

1669
01:10:21,710 --> 01:10:22,410
Oh, thank god.

1670
01:10:22,410 --> 01:10:22,930
I got the head.

1671
01:10:23,730 --> 01:10:24,130
Alright.

1672
01:10:25,090 --> 01:10:26,150
Come on, get back up!

1673
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:27,030
Get back up there!

1674
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:28,090
Phew!

1675
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:28,690
Boop!

1676
01:10:29,170 --> 01:10:29,570
Nice.

1677
01:10:30,210 --> 01:10:30,610
Alright.

1678
01:10:30,750 --> 01:10:31,450
Oh my god.

1679
01:10:31,490 --> 01:10:33,170
Thank god I finally got to the head.

1680
01:10:33,490 --> 01:10:33,890
Look!

1681
01:10:33,970 --> 01:10:34,510
Look at that!

1682
01:10:34,670 --> 01:10:36,030
I got rid of all your electricity!

1683
01:10:36,030 --> 01:10:39,410
When you get really stressed out, like, lightning starts coming out.

1684
01:10:42,890 --> 01:10:46,130
Alright, here we go.

1685
01:10:46,690 --> 01:10:47,490
Come on, please!

1686
01:10:49,410 --> 01:10:49,810
Sir!

1687
01:10:50,610 --> 01:10:52,250
I charged you by the hour!

1688
01:10:52,250 --> 01:10:52,390
Sir!

1689
01:10:55,850 --> 01:10:57,450
It looks really fucking cool.

1690
01:10:57,530 --> 01:10:58,070
Yeah, it does.

1691
01:10:58,350 --> 01:10:59,390
Alright, there you go.

1692
01:10:59,930 --> 01:11:00,650
Bye-bye.

1693
01:11:01,430 --> 01:11:01,910
Phew!

1694
01:11:02,010 --> 01:11:02,750
Oh god.

1695
01:11:02,870 --> 01:11:03,430
Come on!

1696
01:11:03,430 --> 01:11:04,730
Let me fucking poke you!

1697
01:11:07,210 --> 01:11:07,690
Yes.

1698
01:11:08,290 --> 01:11:13,090
You can see I've already helped him so much, you know, because he doesn't have electricity anymore.

1699
01:11:15,790 --> 01:11:16,270
Alright.

1700
01:11:17,470 --> 01:11:17,950
Phew!

1701
01:11:18,590 --> 01:11:19,430
Oh, I did it.

1702
01:11:20,950 --> 01:11:21,430
Yay!

1703
01:11:21,590 --> 01:11:21,970
Anyway.

1704
01:11:22,090 --> 01:11:22,370
Oh, I'm back.

1705
01:11:22,370 --> 01:11:24,710
Unrelated to this, but we're having fish for dinner.

1706
01:11:28,630 --> 01:11:38,010
I also made, like, a little blowhole for them so, like, they don't have to always, like, come up all the time, up in the air for, you know, to breathe.

1707
01:11:38,290 --> 01:11:40,170
They just need to poke their little blowhole.

1708
01:11:40,510 --> 01:11:43,470
Uh, I self-made a blowhole for them.

1709
01:11:48,370 --> 01:11:49,670
Another happy customer.

1710
01:11:53,410 --> 01:11:54,870
What a happy customer.

1711
01:11:54,870 --> 01:11:55,270
Baby fish.

1712
01:11:55,610 --> 01:11:56,530
So happy!

1713
01:11:57,010 --> 01:11:58,330
So considerate!

1714
01:11:59,150 --> 01:11:59,790
I know.

1715
01:12:02,450 --> 01:12:06,030
Unrelated to this, but... Dragoons, I got you guys fish for dinner.

1716
01:12:06,910 --> 01:12:08,630
Totally not dead, by the way.

1717
01:12:08,830 --> 01:12:09,670
Of course not!

1718
01:12:09,990 --> 01:12:10,770
He's not dead!

1719
01:12:11,010 --> 01:12:14,050
He's so relaxed that he fell asleep deep in the ocean.

1720
01:12:14,590 --> 01:12:15,750
That's how fishes sleep.

1721
01:12:17,690 --> 01:12:19,270
Guys, it didn't float up!

1722
01:12:19,430 --> 01:12:20,410
I got you guys!

1723
01:12:20,790 --> 01:12:22,630
Guys, did it float up?

1724
01:12:22,850 --> 01:12:23,350
No!

1725
01:12:27,630 --> 01:12:31,470
If it was dead, it would float up!

1726
01:12:31,690 --> 01:12:33,650
It did not float up!

1727
01:12:33,950 --> 01:12:36,910
So in the end, it is still alive.

1728
01:12:42,950 --> 01:12:44,350
Who's the specialist here?

1729
01:12:44,470 --> 01:12:50,110
Who is the licensed, not self-taught, massage parlor owner here?

1730
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:53,230
Look at all my happy customers surrounding me.

1731
01:12:57,850 --> 01:13:01,150
If they were not happy, they would not be surrounding me with...

1732
01:13:01,350 --> 01:13:03,410
Surrounding me and giving me glowing reviews.

1733
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:09,440
Happy is such a strong word.

1734
01:13:10,020 --> 01:13:11,840
Ooh, what if I don't want to look at it?

1735
01:13:11,860 --> 01:13:12,780
I don't want to look at God.

1736
01:13:14,740 --> 01:13:15,840
Nope, gonna look away.

1737
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:20,480
The forest?

1738
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:22,900
Ooh, the forest colossi.

1739
01:13:32,660 --> 01:13:34,300
Who's my next happy customer?

1740
01:13:40,070 --> 01:13:40,890
Where's the license?

1741
01:13:41,030 --> 01:13:42,050
Okay, you guys want to see my license?

1742
01:13:42,350 --> 01:13:43,150
Okay, give me a sec.

1743
01:13:48,930 --> 01:13:49,890
Okay, fine.

1744
01:13:49,990 --> 01:13:51,230
You guys don't believe me?

1745
01:13:51,750 --> 01:13:52,410
Guys, okay.

1746
01:13:52,810 --> 01:13:57,590
Okay, let me show you guys my... my license real quick.

1747
01:13:58,450 --> 01:14:01,310
Let me... let me show you guys.

1748
01:14:01,430 --> 01:14:05,790
Look, before we... because I have some fucking doubters right now in my chat.

1749
01:14:05,790 --> 01:14:10,710
So I'm here to prove you guys wrong that I have a license to be a massage parlor owner.

1750
01:14:11,050 --> 01:14:12,650
To like, do acupuncture.

1751
01:14:12,850 --> 01:14:16,090
Alright, look, it's called... you guys might not know this.

1752
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:21,570
But I am licensed... to...

1753
01:14:22,570 --> 01:14:25,650
Sorry for speaking so slow because like today I feel extra stupid.

1754
01:14:26,070 --> 01:14:26,630
Like...

1755
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:27,270
Hahahaha!

1756
01:14:30,650 --> 01:14:31,210
Hahahaha!

1757
01:14:33,350 --> 01:14:37,330
And then... Oh, I found... and then... Okay, so I found my photo ID too.

1758
01:14:37,430 --> 01:14:37,750
So...

1759
01:14:37,750 --> 01:14:39,010
Here it is.

1760
01:14:39,070 --> 01:14:39,550
And...

1761
01:14:40,570 --> 01:14:41,050
Uh...

1762
01:14:43,350 --> 01:14:44,410
Wait, give me a sec.

1763
01:14:44,590 --> 01:14:45,350
Give me a sec.

1764
01:14:45,450 --> 01:14:45,750
Sorry.

1765
01:14:46,030 --> 01:14:48,650
It's so hard to find it because it's like...

1766
01:14:49,170 --> 01:14:52,770
There's like so many files in my PC.

1767
01:14:52,890 --> 01:14:55,110
So I'm still trying to find it, you know?

1768
01:14:56,090 --> 01:14:59,050
I'm still... I'm still trying to find it.

1769
01:14:59,130 --> 01:14:59,990
So it's...

1770
01:14:59,990 --> 01:15:06,390
It's really hard to find it because, you know, my file... There's just so many files in there.

1771
01:15:07,050 --> 01:15:08,510
Uh... But don't worry.

1772
01:15:08,630 --> 01:15:08,990
Don't worry.

1773
01:15:09,170 --> 01:15:09,650
I think...

1774
01:15:09,650 --> 01:15:10,390
Oh, wait, wait, wait!

1775
01:15:10,430 --> 01:15:10,830

1776
01:15:10,990 --> 01:15:12,210
Okay, I think I found it.

1777
01:15:12,290 --> 01:15:12,550
Okay.

1778
01:15:12,810 --> 01:15:13,950
Give me a sec, guys.

1779
01:15:14,150 --> 01:15:15,870
Give me a sec, guys.

1780
01:15:19,490 --> 01:15:20,990
It exists, by the way.

1781
01:15:21,310 --> 01:15:22,970
It 100% exists.

1782
01:15:23,490 --> 01:15:24,670
I just need a...

1783
01:15:25,770 --> 01:15:27,610
I just need it to like, you know...

1784
01:15:27,610 --> 01:15:28,270
Um...

1785
01:15:28,270 --> 01:15:30,890
Oh, it's on the wrong file type, guys.

1786
01:15:30,990 --> 01:15:32,190
It's on the wrong file type.

1787
01:15:32,310 --> 01:15:33,010
So I need to...

1788
01:15:33,490 --> 01:15:36,430
Uh... I need to like convert it to the right file type.

1789
01:15:36,530 --> 01:15:37,330
Give me a sec, everybody.

1790
01:15:37,390 --> 01:15:37,950

01:15:39,930 --> 01:15:42,830
Converting it to the right file type real quick.

And then...

1794
01:15:44,990 --> 01:15:46,270
Alright, here we go.

1795
01:15:46,370 --> 01:15:47,630
Okay, and then...

1796
01:15:47,630 --> 01:15:48,110
Alright.

1797
01:15:48,290 --> 01:15:50,610
Okay, it's in like W-E-B-M-P.

1798
01:15:50,710 --> 01:15:53,790
I don't know why I saved it as a W-E-M-B-P.

1799
01:15:54,450 --> 01:15:54,890
But...

1800
01:15:54,890 --> 01:15:55,970
But like...

1801
01:15:55,970 --> 01:15:56,790
Oh my god.

1802
01:15:56,850 --> 01:15:58,210
You guys are gonna regret this.

1803
01:16:02,490 --> 01:16:03,350
You guys...

1804
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:06,730
You guys are gonna regret saying I don't have a license.

1805
01:16:07,430 --> 01:16:08,610
You're gonna regret it.

1806
01:16:10,730 --> 01:16:11,230
License...

1807
01:16:12,390 --> 01:16:15,190
That... That... That I earned from like...

1808
01:16:15,850 --> 01:16:16,570
Massage school.

1809
01:16:17,830 --> 01:16:18,890
You're gonna regret it.

1810
01:16:19,030 --> 01:16:20,470
I earned this in massage school.

1811
01:16:21,210 --> 01:16:22,570
Okay, and then...

1812
01:16:23,630 --> 01:16:24,630

01:16:26,090 --> 01:16:26,650
I found it.

1816
01:16:26,670 --> 01:16:27,490
I found the I-I-D.

1817
01:16:28,270 --> 01:16:29,310
I found the I-I-D, chat.

1818
01:16:29,550 --> 01:16:30,430
Oh my god.

1819
01:16:30,630 --> 01:16:31,490
You're so...

1820
01:16:34,870 --> 01:16:36,470
I found the I-I-D, chat.

1821
01:16:36,690 --> 01:16:37,230
Give me a sec.

1822
01:16:37,450 --> 01:16:38,030
Give me a sec.

1823
01:16:38,130 --> 01:16:40,810
I need a... I need to pin my I-I-D onto my shirt.

1824
01:16:41,070 --> 01:16:49,590
So you guys will know every time when you see it that you'll know that that is a 100% real I-I-D right there.

1825
01:16:50,390 --> 01:16:50,790
Alright.

1826
01:16:51,710 --> 01:16:52,510
What the...

1827
01:16:53,150 --> 01:16:54,710
Look, I even scanned it.

1828
01:16:54,890 --> 01:16:56,470
I found my I-I-D.

1829
01:16:56,470 --> 01:16:58,510
And I even scanned it for you guys.

1830
01:16:59,010 --> 01:17:00,110
So you guys would know.

1831
01:17:01,590 --> 01:17:03,150
That's how dedicated I am.

1832
01:17:03,610 --> 01:17:06,370
I even scanned my I-I-D to my PC.

1833
01:17:07,310 --> 01:17:09,610
Because it was a hard copy license.

1834
01:17:11,530 --> 01:17:14,670
If you are a licensed massage parlor owner...

1835
01:17:15,190 --> 01:17:17,670
Like you would know that you have to like...

1836
01:17:17,670 --> 01:17:20,550
Have a physical copy of your license at all times.

1837
01:17:23,150 --> 01:17:23,950
There you go.

1838
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:32,160
Wait, you can't really see it.

1839
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:34,560
You can't really see it.

1840
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:35,500
There.

1841
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:45,000
There you go.

1842
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:45,980
So real.

1843
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:48,160
It's so real!

1844
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:50,660
It's so real.

1845
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,780
I got it at like massage school.

1846
01:17:53,660 --> 01:17:55,240
No, it's real!

1847
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:56,720
I scanned it!

1848
01:17:57,260 --> 01:18:00,260
I scanned this fucking license!

1849
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:03,180
How can you say this is not real?

1850
01:18:03,460 --> 01:18:04,660
I don't understand!

1851
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:06,400
And so...

1852
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,840
It even has a photo I-D!

1853
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:11,020
So people can't impersonate me!

1854
01:18:11,660 --> 01:18:12,380
Like...

1855
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:15,920
So people can't impersonate me!

1856
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:21,800
How can you guys say that?

1857
01:18:22,660 --> 01:18:23,380
Bro!

1858
01:18:23,460 --> 01:18:25,080
I can't believe it.

1859
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:27,540
I'm gonna put this like...

1860
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:30,860
This is my face now.

1861
01:18:32,980 --> 01:18:35,380
Where's the license- It's on the back of the card!

1862
01:18:36,260 --> 01:18:41,680
Everybody knows the license number is or- For those who are like, Oh, where's the license number?

1863
01:18:42,020 --> 01:18:49,020
We all- Real massage- Massage owners knows that the license number is on the back of the card.

1864
01:18:52,180 --> 01:18:53,780
You guys, you're just fucking jealous.

1865
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:55,700
You didn't complete massage school.

1866
01:18:56,180 --> 01:18:57,080
You're jealous.

1867
01:18:57,220 --> 01:18:59,800
You don't have a thriving massage business like me.

1868
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:02,600
What is that?

1869
01:19:02,740 --> 01:19:03,480
What is that?

1870
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:04,620
You are all fucking jealous!

1871
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:08,720
That's some strong paper attorney badge energy.

1872
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:12,160
Thank you for the super chat, Johnny.

1873
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:13,400
Thank you, thank you.

1874
01:19:13,780 --> 01:19:14,860
Okay, here you go.

1875
01:19:14,900 --> 01:19:15,460
Now you know.

1876
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:20,880
Now you guys will always know that I have a legit license to massage.

1877
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:28,280
Here's my name tag right here.

1878
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:30,260
I'm like certified.

1879
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:34,820
That's the Canadian way of spelling license!

1880
01:19:36,460 --> 01:19:37,460
I'm sorry!

1881
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:43,260
Why is license spelled like that?

1882
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:46,320
It's the Canadian spelling of license!

1883
01:19:46,980 --> 01:19:49,720
It's like British English, but Canadian English.

1884
01:19:50,180 --> 01:19:52,180
My Canadians would vouch for me.

1885
01:19:52,300 --> 01:19:53,760
My Canadians would vouch for me.

1886
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:54,540
It's the Canadian way.

1887
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:57,440
You guys don't understand because you're not Canadian.

1888
01:19:57,820 --> 01:19:58,940
You're not part of the...

1889
01:19:58,940 --> 01:20:01,360
It's like West Coast Canada too.

1890
01:20:04,780 --> 01:20:09,680
People are like, oh, I'm in Canada, but we don't spell it like that.

1891
01:20:09,820 --> 01:20:13,120
Yeah, but that's the West Coast of Canada way of spelling license.

1892
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:15,920
You don't know that because you're not on the West Coast.

1893
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:17,640
You're like, you must be an Eastie.

1894
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:19,180
I bet you're an Eastie, man.

1895
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:25,060
Yeah, I'm Canadian.

1896
01:20:25,060 --> 01:20:27,020
Yeah, Breeze, I bet you're an Eastie.

1897
01:20:27,140 --> 01:20:28,460
You're not a Westie.

1898
01:20:30,740 --> 01:20:36,260
It's the Canadian... It's the West Coast Canadian way of spelling license.

1899
01:20:37,580 --> 01:20:38,580
Alright, here we go.

1900
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:40,400
Let's go.

1901
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:45,700
You just don't understand.

1902
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:48,460
You didn't grow up where I grew up.

1903
01:20:52,940 --> 01:20:54,440
You just don't understand.

1904
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:55,020
You just don't understand.

1905
01:20:55,020 --> 01:20:59,540
By the way, I know it's been like an hour into the game, but I hope the volume's been okay.

1906
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:10,180
I know it might be a bit too late to ask, but I hope the volume's been okay throughout it so far.

1907
01:21:13,100 --> 01:21:16,140
As a true maple syrup drinker, that is a proper...

1908
01:21:16,140 --> 01:21:16,580
Yeah, see!

1909
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:18,440
I knew it!

1910
01:21:18,460 --> 01:21:20,020
I knew it.

1911
01:21:20,020 --> 01:21:20,520
Whoops, whoops.

1912
01:21:20,540 --> 01:21:23,780
I fucking knew I was right.

1913
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:25,800
I knew it.

1914
01:21:25,900 --> 01:21:27,740
Shout out to Bagg.

1915
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,100
Bro, I don't even have to click it.

1916
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:31,240
Shout out to Bagg for the super chat.

1917
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:33,420

1918
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:35,560
His very first super chat on the channel.

1919
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:39,500
And Vy, like, fucking endorses what I say.

1920
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:43,520
As a true maple syrup drinker, that is a proper massage parlor license.

1921
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:44,640
Yeah.

1922
01:21:44,940 --> 01:21:45,460
Yeah.

1923
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:51,340
I knew it.

1924
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,560
I knew I was right.

1925
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,280
I fucking knew it.

1926
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:56,340
I actually wanna raise the music just a little bit.

1927
01:21:57,560 --> 01:21:58,980
I'll raise it a little bit.

1928
01:21:59,020 --> 01:21:59,740
I fucking knew it.

1929
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:00,640
I knew I was correct.

1930
01:22:03,260 --> 01:22:04,580
Okay, this way.

1931
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:06,940
Paid actor.

1932
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:08,180
He is not paid!

1933
01:22:11,380 --> 01:22:12,500
Alright, this way.

1934
01:22:12,980 --> 01:22:14,320
Where am I supposed to go?

1935
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:17,640
I can't believe I'm so far west again.

1936
01:22:17,660 --> 01:22:19,500
I now live in Quebec.

1937
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:22,740
Prezy, thank you for the super chat.

1938
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:23,140
Thank you.

1939
01:22:23,180 --> 01:22:24,780
I bet you Quebecois!

1940
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:31,840
Spoken like a true Quebecois!

1941
01:22:37,180 --> 01:22:39,660
Nice try, Doki, but you forgot one vital point.

1942
01:22:39,820 --> 01:22:41,080
Canada is not real.

1943
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:42,880
D-Dragon, thank you for the super chat.

1944
01:22:42,980 --> 01:22:43,200
Thank you.

1945
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:44,320
That's why I'm a Vtuber.

1946
01:22:44,540 --> 01:22:45,300
Not real.

1947
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:47,980
Just like women!

1948
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:50,500
I fucking knew it.

1949
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:51,960
Canada and women weren't real.

1950
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:53,260
I fucking knew it.

1951
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:54,880
I knew it all along.

1952
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:58,440
Okay, I need to like fucking figure out where to go.

1953
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,760
It has to be this way, right?

1954
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:03,160
It has to be this way, right?

1955
01:23:03,220 --> 01:23:03,720
Alright.

1956
01:23:04,780 --> 01:23:05,280
Okay.

1957
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:12,700
If you're Canadian and you are trying to say I'm not right, If you're Canadian and you are trying to say I'm not right, If you're Canadian and you are trying to say I'm not right, I bet you're Quebecois.

1958
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:18,480
For those who are like, what does that mean?

1959
01:23:18,620 --> 01:23:20,760
That's like, sort of like the Canadian insult.

1960
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:22,540
The people who disagree.

1961
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:26,740
And so, here's a little Canadian history.

1962
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:33,140
But like, even if Canadians disagree with each other, they can all agree that like, the Quebecois is a...

1963
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:37,220
People in Quebec.

1964
01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:41,480
They can all agree that they do not like the people in Quebec.

1965
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:42,620
They can all agree that they do not like the people in Quebec.

1966
01:23:42,620 --> 01:23:42,660
They can all agree that they do not like the people in Quebec.

1967
01:23:46,620 --> 01:23:50,240
And if you're from Quebec, Bro, you know it's true.

1968
01:23:50,460 --> 01:23:52,440
You know it's true.

1969
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:55,600
You know it's true.

1970
01:23:55,740 --> 01:23:56,660
You know it's true.

1971
01:23:56,680 --> 01:23:57,320
You know it's true.

1972
01:23:57,320 --> 01:23:57,680
Bro, okay.

1973
01:23:57,940 --> 01:23:58,760
Here's a little story.

1974
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,340
I have a friend from Quebec.

1975
01:24:00,740 --> 01:24:03,280
And then he told me like, yo, yeah.

1976
01:24:03,380 --> 01:24:04,700
I was like, oh shit, where are you from, Canada?

1977
01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:05,280
I was like, Quebec.

1978
01:24:05,580 --> 01:24:06,700
And I was like, oh, Quebec.

1979
01:24:06,820 --> 01:24:07,680
And he was like, I know.

1980
01:24:15,220 --> 01:24:16,500
I'm from Quebec.

1981
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:29,820
It's because like, okay, the reason why Quebec is like, um, has this reputation, is that Quebec has always tried to like, peace off from Canada.

1982
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:40,560
Because like, Quebec has their own fucking, like, they're like, it's like, if like, a random state in America has their own like, party.

1983
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:42,080
Has their own political party.

1984
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:45,280
And like, they make like, lots of demands and stuff.

1985
01:24:45,460 --> 01:24:48,700
So like, Quebec has their own party called the Québécois.

1986
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:51,660
I think, I remember the, it's like the Québécois, I forgot.

1987
01:24:51,740 --> 01:24:53,300
It's like, they have their own political party.

1988
01:24:53,640 --> 01:25:02,280
And like, at one point in Canadian history, they try to vote to be like, their own fucking, basically they try to vote to be their own country.

1989
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:11,340
They try to, they try to vote to be not Canada.

1990
01:25:11,620 --> 01:25:17,920
And try to be like, their own like, their own like, fucking independent country in the middle of Canada.

1991
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:24,180
Not once, but twice.

1992
01:25:24,220 --> 01:25:26,780
People are like, fucking Québécois.

1993
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:38,580
So that's why like, every Canadian can agree that like, you can be like, the goddamn Québécois.

1994
01:25:44,420 --> 01:25:49,920
It's like a, it's like a little, it's a little like, running joke in Canada.

1995
01:25:53,020 --> 01:25:53,680
It's like a, it's like a little, This way.

1996
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:55,780
Here we go.

1997
01:25:56,140 --> 01:25:58,740
Actually, Texas, but in Canada.

1998
01:26:03,020 --> 01:26:06,820
Okay, but yeah, it's a little, it's a little Quebec fun fact.

1999
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:09,240
A little Canadian fun fact.

2000
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:10,380
A little Canadian fun fact.

2001
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:10,940
Um...

2002
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:21,600
And so it's a little, it's And like, it's like, I'll just say like, you know when a Canadian is from Quebec.

2003
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:26,480
It's actually funny, cause like, if it tells you anything, XQC is from Quebec.

2004
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:38,600
And like, a lot, like the thing is, a lot of people from Quebec like, are very similar to like, how XQC is like.

2005
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:39,040
Like...

2006
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:49,320
Like, I've met so many people from Quebec that has a very similar personality to like, XQC.

2007
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:51,840
And that was like, before he like, blew up.

2008
01:26:51,900 --> 01:26:55,820
Like before he became like, a super, a super big streamer.

2009
01:26:56,060 --> 01:26:59,820
And like, there were, like you know, before like, people started emulating him and stuff.

2010
01:27:00,060 --> 01:27:03,040
But like, a lot of people in Quebec act very similar.

2011
01:27:10,780 --> 01:27:12,480
Alright, yeah of course he's Canadian.

2012
01:27:12,860 --> 01:27:14,060
Yeah, he's from Quebec.

2013
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:14,980
He's Quebecois.

2014
01:27:18,040 --> 01:27:19,060
Let's see...

2015
01:27:19,980 --> 01:27:22,400
There's a little, a little fun fact there.

2016
01:27:23,340 --> 01:27:24,880
Where the fuck do I go?

2017
01:27:26,580 --> 01:27:28,380

Alright.

2021
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:41,800

Thank you, thank you.

How dare you call me a Quebecois.

2029
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:59,520
I'm writing my Caso Doki twitlogger right now.

2030
01:27:59,940 --> 01:28:01,660
The explanation works.

2031
01:28:01,660 --> 01:28:03,020

That's right.

2035
01:28:09,100 --> 01:28:10,100
That's fucking right.

2036
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:10,760
I said it.

2037
01:28:10,900 --> 01:28:12,160
Now where do I go?

2038
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:14,660
Where do I fucking go?

2039
01:28:15,100 --> 01:28:16,080
I'm so lost.

2040
01:28:16,820 --> 01:28:18,440
Why am I always lost?

2041
01:28:20,140 --> 01:28:21,180
Turn left.

2042
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:25,320
Why am I always lost?

2043
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:29,700
My greatest enemy.

2044
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:30,760
Is this this way?

2045
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:31,820
It must be this way.

2046
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:33,580
Am I going back here?

2047
01:28:33,740 --> 01:28:34,000
Okay.

2048
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:35,140
It must be this way.

2049
01:28:35,700 --> 01:28:36,220
Right?

2050
01:28:37,820 --> 01:28:38,840
Oh my god.

2051
01:28:38,940 --> 01:28:40,280
Tell me where to go.

2052
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:40,560
No!

2053
01:28:46,540 --> 01:28:47,060
God!

2054
01:28:48,420 --> 01:28:49,320
Guide me!

2055
01:28:49,720 --> 01:28:50,240
God!

2056
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:53,480
Oh my god.

2057
01:28:53,540 --> 01:28:55,320
God would tell me like how to kill.

2058
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:57,260
But they won't tell me where to go.

2059
01:28:57,480 --> 01:28:58,420
This fucking sucks.

2060
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:02,560
Alright.

2061
01:29:04,220 --> 01:29:05,960
Okay, I'm gonna fucking use this.

2062
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:07,220
Oh my god.

2063
01:29:07,260 --> 01:29:08,180
I get fucking launched.

2064
01:29:08,460 --> 01:29:08,980
Alright.

2065
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:10,840
This...

2066
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:12,920
It's like here.

2067
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:14,300
How the fuck do I get there?

2068
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,580
How the fuck do I get there?

2069
01:29:22,240 --> 01:29:23,180
Alright, this way.

2070
01:29:24,140 --> 01:29:25,760
Did I pass it?

2071
01:29:25,820 --> 01:29:27,040
How do I pass it?

2072
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:28,980
I don't know where it is.

2073
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:31,140
I ran past it?

2074
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:34,180
Here's some yellow for your pain.

2075
01:29:34,640 --> 01:29:36,720
P thank you for the super chat.

2076
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:37,260
Thank you.

2077
01:29:37,260 --> 01:29:37,900
Thank you.

2078
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:42,140
How the fuck do I pass it if I don't even know where it is?

2079
01:29:43,700 --> 01:29:44,580
It's like here!

2080
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:47,320
It's a cave?

2081
01:29:47,680 --> 01:29:48,480
Oh, it's a cave.

2082
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:50,520
Okay, now I need to look for the holes in the rocks.

2083
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:51,480
Alright.

2084
01:29:52,140 --> 01:29:53,920
There has to be a hole in the rock somewhere.

2085
01:29:56,200 --> 01:29:58,100
Where the fuck is the hole in the rock?

2086
01:29:59,460 --> 01:29:59,860
Alright.

2087
01:30:00,660 --> 01:30:02,140
I gotta run in a circle again.

2088
01:30:03,340 --> 01:30:04,900
Wait, are there any fruit in this tree?

2089
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:05,640
There is!

2090
01:30:05,860 --> 01:30:06,060
Okay.

2091
01:30:07,180 --> 01:30:07,980
TPS time.

2092
01:30:09,420 --> 01:30:10,560
That's a fruit, right?

2093
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:11,700
Yeah, that has to be a fruit.

2094
01:30:12,580 --> 01:30:13,060
Okay.

2095
01:30:14,540 --> 01:30:17,100
I almost forgot how to use my fucking bow.

2096
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:19,860
This is one tiny fruit.

2097
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:20,660
Where the fuck did it go?

2098
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:23,640
Where the fuck did the fruit go?

2099
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:25,320
Hello?

2100
01:30:26,440 --> 01:30:29,000
Did the fucking ground absorb the fruit?

2101
01:30:30,620 --> 01:30:31,780
Like, excuse me?

2102
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:32,640
Oh, there it is.

2103
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:33,920
Oh, it was a pineapple.

2104
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:36,240
Yum.

2105
01:30:37,540 --> 01:30:37,980
Okay.

2106
01:30:38,660 --> 01:30:40,280
It was like camouflaged.

2107
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:42,040
Alright, let's see.

2108
01:30:43,660 --> 01:30:44,100
Boop.

2109
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:45,760
Boop.

2110
01:30:46,060 --> 01:30:48,200
Wait, do pineapples... Pineapples don't grow on trees!

2111
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:50,820
What the fu- Is that a pineapple?

2112
01:30:51,240 --> 01:30:52,840
What the fuck kind of fruit is this?

2113
01:30:54,680 --> 01:30:57,580
What kind of genetic mutations of a fruit is this?

2114
01:30:58,360 --> 01:30:59,660
This is not a pineapple.

2115
01:30:59,980 --> 01:31:00,420
Pineapples...

2116
01:31:00,420 --> 01:31:05,820
Oh my god, when I saw what a pineapple tree looks like, what a pineapple plant looks like, they do?

2117
01:31:06,220 --> 01:31:07,340
No, they don't.

2118
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:09,160
They grow on the fucking ground.

2119
01:31:09,460 --> 01:31:12,620
You guys have never seen a fucking pineapple plant?

2120
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:16,080
They're like...

2121
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:18,460
It's like some... It's like... Okay, it's like a giant...

2122
01:31:18,460 --> 01:31:22,780
It's like a fucking grass, and then like a fucking giant pineapple in the middle.

2123
01:31:22,820 --> 01:31:24,120
It's so fucking weird.

2124
01:31:24,300 --> 01:31:28,020
I never like realized how fucking weird pineapple trees are.

2125
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:30,160
Like, not pineapple trees, but like a pineapple plant.

2126
01:31:30,580 --> 01:31:31,820
They're like bushes, yeah.

2127
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,380
Like, they... It's like a pineapple bush.

2128
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:38,380
You'd think that pineapples come from a tree, but it's like a bush.

2129
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:47,680
Look up like... Look up like a pineapple bush or something, and then you'll see what I mean.

2130
01:31:47,980 --> 01:31:49,200
It's so fucking weird.

2131
01:31:49,260 --> 01:31:50,740
It's literally like a bush.

2132
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:52,740
It's not even like a real tree.

2133
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:57,300
Oh yeah, selective breeding.

2134
01:31:57,460 --> 01:31:59,700
Oh yeah, no, we fucking did a lot of that type of shit.

2135
01:31:59,940 --> 01:32:00,580
I was...

2136
01:32:00,580 --> 01:32:06,520
I've been like getting like YouTube shorts of people selective breeding like silk moths or whatever.

2137
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:07,820
And that's what they're called.

2138
01:32:08,390 --> 01:32:09,280
And then like...

2139
01:32:10,620 --> 01:32:18,580
Apparently like, we like uh, we selective breed like uh, silk moths so much that their wings don't even work.

2140
01:32:18,860 --> 01:32:19,480
Like...

2141
01:32:22,420 --> 01:32:24,140
Like, their wings...

2142
01:32:24,140 --> 01:32:28,360
Their wings don't even work, and that they're only... When they...

2143
01:32:28,360 --> 01:32:32,180
When they like, uh, come out their cocoons, all they do is wanna fuck.

2144
01:32:32,460 --> 01:32:34,800
And then they... Their mouths don't even work.

2145
01:32:34,900 --> 01:32:35,860
Their mouths are like...

2146
01:32:35,860 --> 01:32:38,200
Like their brain is just... They wanna bang.

2147
01:32:38,380 --> 01:32:40,420
So they don't eat for five days.

2148
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:41,700
Like three to five days.

2149
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:45,400
They don't eat for three to five days, and all they do is just bang.

2150
01:32:46,100 --> 01:32:47,260
And then they die.

2151
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:49,360
Like they come out their cocoons.

2152
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:53,580
They come out their silk cocoons, bang for three to five days.

2153
01:32:53,660 --> 01:32:56,740
Like bang for like three to five days, and die.

2154
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,280
That's like their life cycle.

2155
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:00,100
That's... That's all.

2156
01:33:00,660 --> 01:33:02,680
It's so fucked up.

2157
01:33:02,780 --> 01:33:05,920
They have a mouth, but they don't know how to use the mouth.

2158
01:33:06,120 --> 01:33:08,980
And apparently their guts are so fucked.

2159
01:33:09,180 --> 01:33:11,540
Their guts don't even work.

2160
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:14,400
It's so messed up.

2161
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:18,940
It's on the other... Oh my god.

2162
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
How the fuck do I get on the other side of the cave?

2163
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:22,660
Oh my god.

2164
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:24,640
And then, like the lady...

2165
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:26,100
The lady was like...

2166
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:34,820
Was like, oh yeah, like we selectively bred the moths so much that like these moths don't... The male moths don't even know how to detach.

2167
01:33:35,180 --> 01:33:37,360
I was like, what do you mean they don't know how to...

2168
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:42,800
I was like...

2169
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:43,560
I was like...

2170
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:43,600
I was like...

2171
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:51,920
The YouTube short lady was like, yes, we selectively bred these moths so much that like the males just don't know how to detach.

2172
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:56,300
So you have to intervene and like detach them yourselves.

2173
01:33:56,640 --> 01:33:57,680
I was like, what?

2174
01:33:58,200 --> 01:33:58,460
Like...

2175
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:01,660
It's like...

2176
01:34:01,660 --> 01:34:08,560
Yes, like I have to like detach them myself or the females won't be able to lay their eggs.

2177
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:11,380
Cause all the males wanna do is bang.

2178
01:34:11,680 --> 01:34:13,640
And I'm like bro, oh my god.

2179
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:14,780
Bro, they...

2180
01:34:16,260 --> 01:34:19,380
I was like, what the fuck, bro?

2181
01:34:19,460 --> 01:34:20,680
That's so fucked up.

2182
01:34:20,860 --> 01:34:21,940
Oh my god.

2183
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:22,920
An actual shrine.

2184
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:24,260
I haven't found a shrine in forever.

2185
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:27,360
Yeah.

2186
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:27,960
Yeah, oh yeah.

2187
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:30,560
The bushes make only one pineapple.

2188
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:32,780
It's actually crazy.

2189
01:34:33,020 --> 01:34:34,120
Pineapple bushes only...

2190
01:34:34,120 --> 01:34:35,340
They only make one pineapple.

2191
01:34:35,420 --> 01:34:37,020
There's a giant fucking pineapple.

2192
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,440
In the middle of a bush.

2193
01:34:39,960 --> 01:34:40,460
Nice prey.

2194
01:34:42,940 --> 01:34:44,140
They made them too.

2195
01:34:44,460 --> 01:34:45,660
Whoa, what the fuck?

2196
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:46,300
He's right here.

2197
01:34:46,680 --> 01:34:47,740
That's looking nice.

2198
01:34:48,140 --> 01:34:49,240
He's literally right here.

2199
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:54,060
Thank you for like just sitting there.

2200
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:58,260
He literally was like, hey, I haven't seen a person in 20 years.

2201
01:34:59,140 --> 01:35:00,000
New friend.

2202
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:01,860
And I'm like, yes, new friend.

2203
01:35:04,680 --> 01:35:06,000
Alright, let's see.

2204
01:35:06,420 --> 01:35:07,380
Maybe here.

2205
01:35:08,740 --> 01:35:09,960
Oh my god.

2206
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:13,200
Nice.

2207
01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:16,800
Thank god for that lizard for letting me eat him.

2208
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:18,620
New friend.

2209
01:35:18,740 --> 01:35:19,740
Time to eat him.

2210
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:24,680
The survival instinct of a silkworm.

2211
01:35:24,680 --> 01:35:26,380
This has to be the cave.

2212
01:35:26,460 --> 01:35:27,440
There's no other caves.

2213
01:35:28,040 --> 01:35:29,760
It has to be the cave.

2214
01:35:30,740 --> 01:35:32,900
Alright, I'm just gonna fucking walk now.

2215
01:35:33,180 --> 01:35:34,380
Alright Arlo, I'm just gonna walk.

2216
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:37,340
Here we go.

2217
01:35:38,200 --> 01:35:39,220
Time to kill you.

2218
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:42,800
I mean time to rehabilitate this person.

2219
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:45,520
Don't worry, sir.

2220
01:35:45,880 --> 01:35:46,940
Wait, where is it?

2221
01:35:47,460 --> 01:35:48,160
Oh man.

2222
01:35:48,340 --> 01:35:50,720
Sorry, my solar powered GPS doesn't work here.

2223
01:35:51,580 --> 01:35:52,760
Alright, we gotta run up.

2224
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:54,900
Alright.

2225
01:35:57,320 --> 01:35:58,440
Time to fucking go.

2226
01:36:00,020 --> 01:36:02,140
Hey Doki, how do I know if acupuncture is right for me?

2227
01:36:02,200 --> 01:36:03,860
I'm tall and the back of my arms hurt.

2228
01:36:03,980 --> 01:36:04,720
Is that a requirement?

2229
01:36:04,940 --> 01:36:06,100
Skellum, thank you for the super chat.

2230
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:06,440
Thank you.

2231
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:06,920
Thank you.

2232
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:11,320
Don't worry, as a professional licensed like acupuncture specialist.

2233
01:36:13,220 --> 01:36:14,120
Wait, give me a sec.

2234
01:36:14,340 --> 01:36:17,140
Let me check my solar power.

2235
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:19,240
GPS needs to tell me where to go.

2236
01:36:20,700 --> 01:36:21,520
Give me a sec.

2237
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:22,240
Alright.

2238
01:36:23,740 --> 01:36:24,060
Um.

2239
01:36:24,680 --> 01:36:25,320
Thank you.

2240
01:36:25,320 --> 01:36:26,940
What a good question.

2241
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:27,820
Alright.

2242
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:35,520
So like, if you touch under your arm, and you feel all the stress juices coming out right now.

2243
01:36:35,580 --> 01:36:38,400
Like you feel the stress juices underneath your skin suit.

2244
01:36:38,580 --> 01:36:41,240
That means you're like super stressed out.

2245
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:48,760
So like, all that like liquid in your arm right there, it's like, those are like the stress toxins building up.

2246
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:49,660
So...

2247
01:36:53,400 --> 01:36:57,900
See, it's the stress toxins building up under your arm.

2248
01:36:58,060 --> 01:37:01,920
So like, obviously, if you want to try a home remedy...

2249
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:10,900
I would highly suggest, so like, if you want to try a home remedy as a specialist.

2250
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:13,380
By the way, don't try this at home.

2251
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:18,400
But what I would do is that I would get like a really, like you know, like a very sharp needle, just like the sword.

2252
01:37:18,620 --> 01:37:19,140
You know?

2253
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:21,200
Just like...

2254
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:23,860
Just like the sword, you know?

2255
01:37:24,820 --> 01:37:29,220
And just start digging the stress toxins out.

2256
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:31,220
But obviously don't do that.

2257
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:32,100
Do not do that.

2258
01:37:32,140 --> 01:37:32,900
I am a professional!

2259
01:37:33,480 --> 01:37:35,860
Contact your local acupuncture artist.

2260
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:41,960
Contact your local acupuncture artist to help you get that toxin out.

2261
01:37:44,160 --> 01:37:44,720
to help you get that toxin out.

2262
01:37:44,720 --> 01:37:47,340
I am a specialist, so I can do it.

2263
01:37:48,460 --> 01:37:51,180
Look at all the colossus that... that I have.

2264
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:52,020
Uh...

2265
01:37:52,020 --> 01:37:53,620
They gave me glowing reviews.

2266
01:37:54,100 --> 01:37:55,200
Where the fuck do I go?

2267
01:37:56,700 --> 01:37:57,580
Is it here?

2268
01:37:57,960 --> 01:37:59,320
Is it inside here?

2269
01:38:02,940 --> 01:38:05,380
Yes, do not perform acupuncture on yourself.

2270
01:38:06,220 --> 01:38:07,700
Contact your local specialist.

2271
01:38:11,060 --> 01:38:13,820
Oh my god, my solar powered sword does not work right now.

2272
01:38:14,360 --> 01:38:14,840
I...

2273
01:38:18,040 --> 01:38:19,000
Oh my...

2274
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,060
Oh, it's like over there.

2275
01:38:20,140 --> 01:38:20,760
Okay, I see it.

2276
01:38:21,480 --> 01:38:22,500
I see it now.

2277
01:38:22,860 --> 01:38:23,500
I see the tempo.

2278
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:25,220
I see the tempo.

2279
01:38:26,680 --> 01:38:28,180
Alright, disclaimer by the way.

2280
01:38:28,240 --> 01:38:29,760
I need you guys to know this was just a joke.

2281
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:30,680
Um...

2282
01:38:31,400 --> 01:38:32,560
I am a professional.

2283
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,900
So I am legally allowed to do stuff like this.

2284
01:38:38,680 --> 01:38:42,500
Bro, a GPS sword that's solar powered has to be the worst fucking sword.

2285
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:45,220
Has to be the worst fucking GPS device.

2286
01:38:45,640 --> 01:38:47,020
Cause it's like, what if it's nighttime?

2287
01:38:47,720 --> 01:38:49,920
What if it's nighttime and I have to kill a colossus?

2288
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,080
How would that work?

2289
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:57,780
I have it like... Where's your license?

2290
01:38:58,100 --> 01:38:59,140
Where's your fucking license?

2291
01:38:59,260 --> 01:38:59,840
Right here.

2292
01:39:06,030 --> 01:39:07,250
Any lawyers in chat?

2293
01:39:09,030 --> 01:39:11,070
I must have a lawyer dragoon right now.

2294
01:39:11,430 --> 01:39:13,330
Any dragoon lawyers in chat?

2295
01:39:13,750 --> 01:39:17,570
Here to verify my very legal license.

2296
01:39:19,230 --> 01:39:19,750
Where's...

2297
01:39:19,750 --> 01:39:20,370
Where's the notary?

2298
01:39:20,590 --> 01:39:21,950
I must have a notary here.

2299
01:39:22,110 --> 01:39:23,250
I need a notary right now.

2300
01:39:23,690 --> 01:39:28,710
Hahaha Papa Korn, thank you for the super chat.

2301
01:39:28,790 --> 01:39:29,270
Thank you, thank you.

2302
01:39:29,350 --> 01:39:36,850
As an actual licensed massage therapist, I'm smiling but I'm shaking my head.

2303
01:39:37,010 --> 01:39:38,630
Papa Korn, thank you for the super chat.

2304
01:39:38,730 --> 01:39:39,170
Thank you, thank you.

2305
01:39:39,170 --> 01:39:41,210
Cause you're shaking your head at the chatters, right?

2306
01:39:41,490 --> 01:39:47,730
Cause you're like, I can't believe these people in chat does not know like basic fucking massage stuff.

2307
01:39:48,350 --> 01:39:51,570
Hahaha Bro, I know!

2308
01:39:52,110 --> 01:39:53,670
Korn, I fucking know.

2309
01:39:53,690 --> 01:39:57,650
I can't believe they doubt our fucking skills.

2310
01:39:57,950 --> 01:40:06,090
Just because you don't see massage therapy, just because you doubt my skills doesn't mean I'm wrong.

2311
01:40:06,610 --> 01:40:07,970
I don't think this is it.

2312
01:40:08,370 --> 01:40:13,970
Hahaha Oh no, there's a real one?

2313
01:40:14,110 --> 01:40:14,710
Yes, me!

2314
01:40:15,750 --> 01:40:17,090
I'm the real one!

2315
01:40:17,390 --> 01:40:20,210
What the fuck do you mean, oh no, there's a real one?

2316
01:40:20,310 --> 01:40:23,930
You've been watching a real massage therapist this entire time.

2317
01:40:26,650 --> 01:40:27,010
Phew.

2318
01:40:28,090 --> 01:40:28,930
Alright, here we go.

2319
01:40:33,100 --> 01:40:34,460
Alright, we must go this way.

2320
01:40:34,540 --> 01:40:35,460
I wonder if Arlo can get here.

2321
01:40:35,680 --> 01:40:36,660
Arlo, can you get up here?

2322
01:40:37,640 --> 01:40:38,000
Arlo?

2323
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:40,200
Arlo?

2324
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:41,020
Can you get up here?

2325
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:45,060
Well, how good.

Thank you for the super chat.

2327
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:46,700
Thank you, thank you.

2328
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:49,360
The significance of your certificate seems forged.

2329
01:40:49,540 --> 01:40:50,860
What are you, a real lawyer?

2330
01:40:50,860 --> 01:40:53,400
Come back when you have a law degree.

2331
01:40:53,620 --> 01:40:55,640
Thank you for the super chat, Momo.

2332
01:40:59,120 --> 01:41:00,440
Where's your fucking law degree?

2333
01:41:00,640 --> 01:41:01,360
Are you a notary?

2334
01:41:02,680 --> 01:41:03,880
Are you a notary?

2335
01:41:04,160 --> 01:41:05,360
That's fucking right.

2336
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:10,260

01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:11,960
But like, don't dox yourself.

2338

Post your real degree on Twitter right now in my birdseeders tag.

2339
01:41:17,500 --> 01:41:18,860
But also do not dox yourself.

2340
01:41:19,060 --> 01:41:21,120
Make sure the censored, like, the...

2341
01:41:21,120 --> 01:41:23,660
I didn't think that could die.

2342
01:41:26,100 --> 01:41:28,120
Just so you know.

2343
01:41:32,580 --> 01:41:35,620
But also, I only take Ivy Leagues.

2344
01:41:38,040 --> 01:41:42,580
I only take Ivy Leagues degrees.

2345
01:41:42,580 --> 01:41:43,260
Ivy Leagues degrees.

2346
01:41:48,180 --> 01:41:49,820
Alright, how the fuck do I get downstairs?

2347
01:41:52,740 --> 01:41:53,300
Alright.

2348
01:41:54,680 --> 01:41:55,480
Oh yeah!

2349
01:41:55,620 --> 01:41:56,080
Oh yeah!

2350
01:41:56,180 --> 01:42:00,740
And it has to be like a... How the fuck do I get downstairs?

2351
01:42:01,220 --> 01:42:02,080
Oh, this way.

2352
01:42:02,720 --> 01:42:05,840
It has to be a Canadian...

2353
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:07,120
Oh my god!

2354
01:42:07,180 --> 01:42:10,880
A Canadian university that is equivalent to...

2355
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:12,620
I mean like...

2356
01:42:12,620 --> 01:42:18,040
Because American massage laws are not the same as Canadian massage parlor laws.

2357
01:42:18,940 --> 01:42:19,700
Checkmate.

2358
01:42:25,460 --> 01:42:26,220
Alright.

2359
01:42:27,940 --> 01:42:29,260
What are these requirements?

2360
01:42:29,580 --> 01:42:32,420
These are all the requirements to like...

2361
01:42:32,420 --> 01:42:33,920
Is he mean?

2362
01:42:34,640 --> 01:42:35,400
Fuck!

2363
01:42:35,560 --> 01:42:36,300
Okay, he's mean.

2364
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:37,560
He's...

2365
01:42:40,520 --> 01:42:41,760
He's a mean guy.

2366
01:42:42,480 --> 01:42:43,060
He's a mean guy.

2367
01:42:43,060 --> 01:42:43,100
He's a mean guy.

2368
01:42:43,780 --> 01:42:45,520
He's not... He's not happy.

2369
01:42:46,020 --> 01:42:48,960
Sir, I'm ready for your appointment, sir.

2370
01:42:49,960 --> 01:42:50,940
Sir, don't worry.

2371
01:42:52,100 --> 01:42:53,020
Sir, don't worry.

2372
01:42:53,100 --> 01:42:53,860
I'm ready for our...

2373
01:42:53,860 --> 01:42:54,140
Sir!

2374
01:42:56,260 --> 01:42:57,640
Sir, I'm ready for our appointment.

2375
01:42:57,780 --> 01:42:58,560
Oh shit!

2376
01:42:58,700 --> 01:42:59,060
Oh wait!

2377
01:42:59,120 --> 01:42:59,820
We're still okay.

2378
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:01,300
Where the fuck do I shoot?

2379
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:02,860
His legs?

2380
01:43:04,660 --> 01:43:07,200
Sir, here's the acupuncture right now.

2381
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:10,420
Oh, he didn't like that.

2382
01:43:10,600 --> 01:43:11,460
Oh, did I do it?

2383
01:43:12,100 --> 01:43:12,460
Okay.

2384
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:16,440
Did I get fall damage from that?

2385
01:43:16,540 --> 01:43:17,200
No, I don't.

2386
01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:17,960
Okay.

2387
01:43:18,040 --> 01:43:18,900
I'm coming over, sir!

2388
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:21,080
Don't worry!

2389
01:43:21,180 --> 01:43:22,400
Everybody likes a bro!

2390
01:43:33,980 --> 01:43:35,280
Okay, time to slap the dick.

2391
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:39,020
Don't worry!

2392
01:43:39,640 --> 01:43:42,060
I am also a licensed veterinarian!

2393
01:43:44,020 --> 01:43:45,560
There's too many lizards out there!

2394
01:43:45,620 --> 01:43:47,440
We need to make sure we fix the lizard population!

2395
01:43:48,620 --> 01:43:49,140
Hahaha!

2396
01:43:53,100 --> 01:43:58,340
Guys, I am only trying to fix the lizard overpopulation as well!

2397
01:43:58,720 --> 01:44:02,280
I just got my veterinarian degree too, chat!

2398
01:44:02,740 --> 01:44:04,440
So I'm here to fix the...

2399
01:44:04,440 --> 01:44:06,120
I'm here to fix the...

2400
01:44:06,120 --> 01:44:09,020
It's like when there's too many cats and you got neutered cats.

2401
01:44:09,480 --> 01:44:10,460
That's what I'm doing.

2402
01:44:10,580 --> 01:44:11,560
It's a tough job.

2403
01:44:12,140 --> 01:44:13,920
But like, there's just too many cats.

2404
01:44:14,440 --> 01:44:15,900
Too many lizards in the world.

2405
01:44:15,900 --> 01:44:17,000
You saw the lizards?

2406
01:44:17,240 --> 01:44:20,200
You all saw how many lizards there were out there!

2407
01:44:20,980 --> 01:44:21,780
Hahaha!

2408
01:44:23,740 --> 01:44:25,840
I'm a licensed veterinarian!

2409
01:44:28,180 --> 01:44:30,360
I'm here to solve the overpopulation!

2410
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:35,600
He's acupuncturing!

2411
01:44:35,620 --> 01:44:36,380
Hahaha!

2412
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:38,860
And neutering services?

2413
01:44:39,660 --> 01:44:42,100
Um... It's neutering services?

2414
01:44:43,420 --> 01:44:45,140
You wouldn't understand.

2415
01:44:48,020 --> 01:44:48,920
The fuck?

2416
01:44:49,320 --> 01:44:50,200
There you go.

2417
01:44:51,380 --> 01:44:53,460
Does he not like it when I shoot his toes?

2418
01:44:55,860 --> 01:44:57,300
Where the fuck is his other toe?

2419
01:44:57,400 --> 01:44:57,900
There it is.

2420
01:44:58,700 --> 01:44:59,580
There you go.

2421
01:44:59,680 --> 01:45:00,240
Sir!

2422
01:45:01,780 --> 01:45:03,340
We have a problem!

2423
01:45:03,500 --> 01:45:04,660
Your late night...

2424
01:45:04,660 --> 01:45:08,600
Your late night fucking romps are an issue!

2425
01:45:09,220 --> 01:45:09,820
Sir!

2426
01:45:10,160 --> 01:45:11,360
Where the fuck is the...

2427
01:45:12,260 --> 01:45:13,540
Wait, did I stab everything?

2428
01:45:15,280 --> 01:45:16,080
Where the fuck...

2429
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:16,520
Where?

2430
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:22,020
Oh, it's cause I didn't have my sword out!

2431
01:45:23,620 --> 01:45:24,140
Sir!

2432
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:25,060
Hahaha!

2433
01:45:25,340 --> 01:45:25,860
Hahaha!

2434
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:30,640
I was like, where the fuck is your dick?

2435
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:31,360
Hahaha!

2436
01:45:33,200 --> 01:45:33,720
Hahaha!

2437
01:45:35,280 --> 01:45:38,720
Bro, I didn't know I was that good at my job.

2438
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:39,200
Bro!

2439
01:45:39,480 --> 01:45:40,000
Hahaha!

2440
01:45:40,360 --> 01:45:40,880
Hahaha!

2441
01:45:42,100 --> 01:45:42,360
Hahaha!

2442
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:46,100
I just thought I was really good at my job!

2443
01:45:46,180 --> 01:45:48,360
I thought I was really good at, like, neutering!

2444
01:45:48,720 --> 01:45:49,200
Hahaha!

2445
01:45:50,640 --> 01:45:51,760
Neutering lizards!

2446
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:52,580
I don't know!

2447
01:45:53,320 --> 01:45:53,880
Hahaha!

2448
01:45:55,360 --> 01:45:55,920
Hahaha!

2449
01:45:57,020 --> 01:46:00,560
I don't know, I just thought I just got it the first try!

2450
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:01,520
Hahaha!

2451
01:46:02,080 --> 01:46:02,160
Hahaha!

2452
01:46:04,540 --> 01:46:05,800
Alright, he's gotta climb.

2453
01:46:07,240 --> 01:46:08,140
Gotta climb.

2454
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:09,400
Get over here.

2455
01:46:10,840 --> 01:46:12,180
Bro, you can't just...

2456
01:46:12,180 --> 01:46:13,180
Yes, I can!

2457
01:46:13,360 --> 01:46:14,340
It's part of neutering!

2458
01:46:14,520 --> 01:46:17,040
Only licensed veterinarians can fact check me.

2459
01:46:17,080 --> 01:46:18,180
Are you a licensed... Hahaha!

2460
01:46:21,120 --> 01:46:21,560
Hahaha!

2461
01:46:22,940 --> 01:46:27,300
Don't talk to me unless you're... Don't fact check me unless you're a licensed veterinarian!

2462
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:28,240
Hahaha!

2463
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:28,980
Hahaha!

2464
01:46:29,680 --> 01:46:30,120
Hahaha!

2465
01:46:31,540 --> 01:46:32,160
That's right.

2466
01:46:32,340 --> 01:46:34,980
I bet you're not even a licensed veterinarian.

2467
01:46:36,180 --> 01:46:36,620
Alright.

2468
01:46:36,820 --> 01:46:37,480
Oh, wait.

2469
01:46:37,640 --> 01:46:38,600
Okay, we gotta...

2470
01:46:39,400 --> 01:46:39,980
Grab the heart now.

2471
01:46:40,860 --> 01:46:43,760
So he can stop falling in love with all these lizards.

2472
01:46:44,840 --> 01:46:45,320
Hahaha!

2473
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:47,580
It's good for you!

2474
01:46:49,580 --> 01:46:50,960
It's good for you!

2475
01:46:51,180 --> 01:46:51,300
It's good for you!

2476
01:46:51,300 --> 01:46:53,980
You need... You are contributing to the problem!

2477
01:46:54,220 --> 01:46:55,520
Oh my... Where am I?

2478
01:46:56,540 --> 01:46:57,020
Hahaha!

2479
01:46:57,920 --> 01:46:58,400
Bro!

2480
01:46:58,600 --> 01:47:00,920
Get out!

2481
01:47:02,040 --> 01:47:05,400
Guys, we gotta, like, make sure he never falls in love again too.

2482
01:47:05,640 --> 01:47:06,760
Oh my god!

2483
01:47:06,820 --> 01:47:07,880
I don't think he liked that.

2484
01:47:09,820 --> 01:47:10,300
Look!

2485
01:47:11,640 --> 01:47:13,640
Look at all these iguanas!

2486
01:47:13,780 --> 01:47:14,820
In, like, LA!

2487
01:47:15,040 --> 01:47:17,780
They are an invasive species because of you!

2488
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:19,280
Hahaha!

2489
01:47:19,480 --> 01:47:20,860
He did not like...

2490
01:47:20,860 --> 01:47:22,020
That's so crazy.

2491
01:47:22,100 --> 01:47:23,820
I wonder why he didn't like that I neutered him.

2492
01:47:24,060 --> 01:47:24,500
I...

2493
01:47:24,500 --> 01:47:25,300
Hahaha!

2494
01:47:26,220 --> 01:47:26,660
Hahaha!

2495
01:47:28,260 --> 01:47:29,660
That's so fucking crazy!

2496
01:47:30,140 --> 01:47:32,820
Yeah, I do know, like, iguanas are, like, an invasive species.

2497
01:47:33,540 --> 01:47:34,940
Um, was it in LA?

2498
01:47:35,100 --> 01:47:35,540
I don't remember.

2499
01:47:35,680 --> 01:47:39,680
It was, like, some fucking state where, like, iguanas became an invasive species.

2500
01:47:40,100 --> 01:47:41,840
And, like, there's, like, an old order now.

2501
01:47:41,980 --> 01:47:49,760
There's, like, a fucking state order where, like, if you see an iguana, you gotta kill it because... because there's too many iguanas!

2502
01:47:49,860 --> 01:47:50,380
Hahaha!

2503
01:47:50,380 --> 01:47:53,060
That are, like, destroying the fucking city.

2504
01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:54,360
Is it Florida?

2505
01:47:54,840 --> 01:47:55,360
Yeah.

2506
01:47:57,120 --> 01:48:06,240
There's, like, a state order now where, like, if you see a fucking iguana in Florida, you gotta fucking kill it because there's too many iguanas.

2507
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:07,080
It's...

2508
01:48:07,740 --> 01:48:09,840
That's actually fucking wild.

2509
01:48:09,960 --> 01:48:10,560
I didn't...

2510
01:48:11,640 --> 01:48:13,340
And it's all because of him!

2511
01:48:15,880 --> 01:48:18,020
Yeah, they're, like, actually killed on sight.

2512
01:48:20,520 --> 01:48:21,400
Alright, sir.

2513
01:48:21,500 --> 01:48:23,620
This is why you contributed to the problem.

2514
01:48:24,240 --> 01:48:24,500
Hahaha!

2515
01:48:26,340 --> 01:48:29,160
Iguana population all because of this one guy.

2516
01:48:29,480 --> 01:48:32,080
He got... That's why we had to fucking neuter him.

2517
01:48:33,880 --> 01:48:35,560
Some people just eat it.

2518
01:48:36,160 --> 01:48:37,060
Oh my god!

2519
01:48:37,080 --> 01:48:38,260
It's back to the dick?

2520
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:39,000
Hahaha!

2521
01:48:39,360 --> 01:48:39,900
Hahaha!

2522
01:48:41,820 --> 01:48:42,420
What?

2523
01:48:42,420 --> 01:48:43,020
Bro!

2524
01:48:43,260 --> 01:48:44,800
The la... Oh my god!

2525
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:45,280
Get me out!

2526
01:48:45,420 --> 01:48:46,360
Get me out!

2527
01:48:46,600 --> 01:48:47,620
The last...

2528
01:48:47,620 --> 01:48:49,540
He's like, no, I will never stop!

2529
01:48:51,120 --> 01:48:52,440
The final shot!

2530
01:48:53,100 --> 01:48:53,400
Hahaha!

2531
01:48:54,060 --> 01:48:56,100
Guys, I didn't finish my job.

2532
01:48:57,120 --> 01:48:58,380
There's still babies in there.

2533
01:48:58,520 --> 01:49:00,500
I didn't finish my job.

2534
01:49:03,060 --> 01:49:03,660
Alright.

2535
01:49:03,820 --> 01:49:06,580
This is why there's an iguana problem in Florida.

2536
01:49:08,380 --> 01:49:10,120
This is exactly why.

2537
01:49:10,260 --> 01:49:11,120
Where the fuck is he?

2538
01:49:11,200 --> 01:49:12,060
How do I get out of here?

2539
01:49:13,020 --> 01:49:13,780
Oh, should I heal?

2540
01:49:14,140 --> 01:49:15,000
Oh, I didn't even realize.

2541
01:49:15,620 --> 01:49:16,720
Give me a sec, sir.

2542
01:49:16,780 --> 01:49:17,360
I'm gonna heal.

2543
01:49:18,100 --> 01:49:19,000
Give me a sec.

2544
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:25,940
They hatchet and it felt more uncomfortable, but I can't look away.

2545
01:49:26,520 --> 01:49:26,960
Hahaha!

2546
01:49:27,080 --> 01:49:27,180
Hahaha!

2547
01:49:28,180 --> 01:49:29,880
He crew it back!

2548
01:49:30,320 --> 01:49:32,800
He had two, like, in the kid now or some shit.

2549
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:35,360
Guys, sorry.

2550
01:49:35,480 --> 01:49:36,560
I forgot to snip one.

2551
01:49:36,580 --> 01:49:38,540
I need one more from the neuter service.

2552
01:49:38,860 --> 01:49:39,580
Don't worry.

2553
01:49:39,900 --> 01:49:44,320
Ka-Ka-Doki, the massage therapist and your local neuter services.

2554
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:46,240
For lizards only.

2555
01:49:46,400 --> 01:49:47,840
I can only work on lizards though.

2556
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:48,580
Nothing else.

2557
01:49:50,320 --> 01:49:50,940
Look at that.

2558
01:49:52,560 --> 01:49:54,400
Guys, I'm so talented.

2559
01:49:55,220 --> 01:49:59,220
Of course you would contact your local massage therapist for lizard neuter.

2560
01:49:59,560 --> 01:50:00,200
Alright.

2561
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:03,680
One more hit.

2562
01:50:04,280 --> 01:50:04,880
One more hit.

2563
01:50:05,100 --> 01:50:05,700
Don't worry!

2564
01:50:06,580 --> 01:50:07,280
You don't need kids!

2565
01:50:07,420 --> 01:50:10,240
You can't afford all the fucking child services.

2566
01:50:10,580 --> 01:50:11,540
Not child services.

2567
01:50:11,680 --> 01:50:11,760
Sorry.

2568
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:12,860
What is it?

2569
01:50:13,340 --> 01:50:15,660
You can't afford the payments.

2570
01:50:19,300 --> 01:50:21,980
It's the opposite of a happy ending.

2571
01:50:22,280 --> 01:50:23,240
Child support.

2572
01:50:23,440 --> 01:50:24,420
Yeah, child support.

2573
01:50:30,900 --> 01:50:31,480
Alright.

2574
01:50:32,100 --> 01:50:32,680
Nice.

2575
01:50:33,200 --> 01:50:34,000
It's okay.

2576
01:50:34,100 --> 01:50:35,800
He couldn't afford the child support anyway.

2577
01:50:35,800 --> 01:50:36,920
Guys.

2578
01:50:37,260 --> 01:50:40,360
He literally caused the Florida iguana epidemic.

2579
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:42,560
We gotta get rid of him.

2580
01:50:46,460 --> 01:50:50,460
Just like how barbers are used to perform surgery.

2581
01:50:55,420 --> 01:50:56,320
She's awake!

2582
01:50:56,540 --> 01:50:57,400
I did it!

2583
01:50:59,700 --> 01:51:01,020
Look at that.

2584
01:51:01,060 --> 01:51:02,020
So fucking easy.

2585
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:08,980
Look, I have to have multiple jobs to afford taking care of...

2586
01:51:08,980 --> 01:51:09,900
Oh, it was just a dream.

2587
01:51:10,500 --> 01:51:11,300
God damn.

2588
01:51:12,300 --> 01:51:13,500
Bro, I'm just...

2589
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:17,800
After neutering that fucking giant lizard, I'm getting homesick for my boo.

2590
01:51:20,140 --> 01:51:23,580
He heard that she heard the iguana problem was over.

2591
01:51:54,220 --> 01:51:55,180
Please wake...

2592
01:51:55,180 --> 01:51:56,200
Oh my gosh, she's so dead.

2593
01:51:56,380 --> 01:51:57,580
Look at her fucking skin.

2594
01:51:57,980 --> 01:51:59,120
Yeah, that's dead.

2595
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:04,120
Bro, why isn't she now like rotting away?

2596
01:52:04,780 --> 01:52:05,800
A fucking...

2597
01:52:05,900 --> 01:52:08,000
How the fuck does she look so good?

2598
01:52:10,380 --> 01:52:11,940
That's like dead dead skin.

2599
01:52:14,120 --> 01:52:17,100
And she's not trying to be a fucking goth girl.

2600
01:52:21,420 --> 01:52:22,400
Yup, are you dead?

2601
01:52:22,600 --> 01:52:23,000
Yup, dead.

2602
01:52:25,200 --> 01:52:28,080
I feel like... Oh, a tree is near you, girl.

2603
01:52:28,160 --> 01:52:29,320
It sleeps in a dry lake.

2604
01:52:29,640 --> 01:52:31,400
Another fucking lake?!

2605
01:52:31,400 --> 01:52:33,780
But now it's a dead lake?!

2606
01:52:33,780 --> 01:52:35,300
Are you fucking kidding?

2607
01:52:37,360 --> 01:52:40,580
How many lakes are there?!

2608
01:52:40,580 --> 01:52:40,920
How many lakes are there?!

2609
01:52:42,400 --> 01:52:43,940
Oh my god.

2610
01:52:44,060 --> 01:52:45,460
Not to find a dead lake.

2611
01:52:45,680 --> 01:52:46,460
An empty lake.

2612
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:49,920
More lakes.

2613
01:52:52,420 --> 01:52:53,940
Alright, time to pray.

2614
01:52:54,220 --> 01:52:55,540
Save the prey, chat.

2615
01:52:55,880 --> 01:52:56,780
Save the prey.

2616
01:52:59,820 --> 01:53:00,340
Boop.

2617
01:53:00,760 --> 01:53:02,300
Save the prey.

2618
01:53:04,100 --> 01:53:05,260
At least three more.

2619
01:53:05,360 --> 01:53:05,880
There's three more!

2620
01:53:05,900 --> 01:53:07,260
Three fucking lakes?!

2621
01:53:07,260 --> 01:53:07,880
Bro!

2622
01:53:08,220 --> 01:53:09,620
Three different lakes!

2623
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:13,780
This is why I would never survive in like the olden times.

2624
01:53:15,780 --> 01:53:17,380
Alright, where do I go?

2625
01:53:19,180 --> 01:53:22,100
Where is the fucking dead lake?

2626
01:53:22,780 --> 01:53:23,920
It is...

2627
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:24,660
behind me.

2628
01:53:24,780 --> 01:53:25,080
Okay.

2629
01:53:25,300 --> 01:53:26,200
This is it.

2630
01:53:27,020 --> 01:53:28,180
It's behind me.

2631
01:53:29,760 --> 01:53:30,500
Come on.

2632
01:53:30,660 --> 01:53:33,660
If I make you go forward, maybe you'll turn by yourself.

2633
01:53:33,660 --> 01:53:34,520
Okay, no.

2634
01:53:34,620 --> 01:53:35,660
I have to physically turn.

2635
01:53:36,200 --> 01:53:37,040
Turn Arlo.

2636
01:53:37,420 --> 01:53:38,280
Arlo, go!

2637
01:53:41,540 --> 01:53:43,280
Isn't a dry lake just land?

2638
01:53:43,380 --> 01:53:45,740
No, because fucking dry lakes has a hole.

2639
01:53:48,600 --> 01:53:49,320
This way.

2640
01:53:49,460 --> 01:53:49,760
Okay.

2641
01:53:50,380 --> 01:53:51,220
Go, Arlo!

2642
01:53:51,400 --> 01:53:51,640
Go!

2643
01:53:53,040 --> 01:53:54,680
Take me to the dry lake!

2644
01:53:56,320 --> 01:53:58,520
We'll assume that dry lakes, there's a hole.

2645
01:53:59,060 --> 01:54:00,460
To make the dry lake.

2646
01:54:00,460 --> 01:54:02,780
Okay, this is the normal lake.

2647
01:54:03,700 --> 01:54:05,160
Where the fuck is dry lake?

2648
01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:07,200
Does it go to the other side?

2649
01:54:08,360 --> 01:54:09,700
Is it the other side?

2650
01:54:12,540 --> 01:54:13,340
Oh, it is.

2651
01:54:13,480 --> 01:54:14,220
Okay, we got...

2652
01:54:14,220 --> 01:54:15,360
How do I get to the...

2653
01:54:15,360 --> 01:54:15,880
Okay, this way.

2654
01:54:16,360 --> 01:54:17,060
Alright, Arlo.

2655
01:54:17,120 --> 01:54:18,360
Time to get to the other side.

2656
01:54:22,630 --> 01:54:23,710
I guess like...

2657
01:54:23,710 --> 01:54:25,550
I follow this pathway.

2658
01:54:28,110 --> 01:54:28,630
I'll go.

2659
01:54:30,130 --> 01:54:30,570
Please.

2660
01:54:30,650 --> 01:54:31,450
Arlo, please!

2661
01:54:31,550 --> 01:54:31,990
Arlo, please!

2662
01:54:32,690 --> 01:54:34,090
Please, you're better than this.

2663
01:54:34,130 --> 01:54:35,570
You used to be a main character.

2664
01:54:35,790 --> 01:54:36,690
What the fuck happened?

2665
01:54:36,770 --> 01:54:37,570
Okay, do I have to turn?

2666
01:54:38,070 --> 01:54:38,550
No.

2667
01:54:38,670 --> 01:54:39,470
Okay, thank god.

2668
01:54:39,630 --> 01:54:41,810
Arlo can walk for me now.

2669
01:54:43,270 --> 01:54:45,430
A nice relaxing squirrel.

2670
01:54:47,250 --> 01:54:49,550
You know, I think I'm doing really well with my business.

2671
01:54:51,490 --> 01:54:52,450
A license...

2672
01:54:52,450 --> 01:54:54,330
A license, massage...

2673
01:54:54,330 --> 01:54:55,770
A massage parlor owner.

2674
01:54:56,570 --> 01:54:57,530
And a...

2675
01:54:58,230 --> 01:54:59,670
And a veterinarian?

2676
01:55:00,590 --> 01:55:01,330
Get a...

2677
01:55:02,690 --> 01:55:04,070
And I can do both, guys.

2678
01:55:04,230 --> 01:55:05,590
Ladies, ladies!

2679
01:55:06,350 --> 01:55:08,290
I am basically...

2680
01:55:08,290 --> 01:55:10,230
I am basically...

2681
01:55:10,230 --> 01:55:12,270
the dream husband material.

2682
01:55:12,670 --> 01:55:16,630
I can perform neuters and also give you a massage.

2683
01:55:18,510 --> 01:55:20,670
I can fix the iguana.

2684
01:55:21,030 --> 01:55:23,390
The iguana pandemic.

2685
01:55:23,770 --> 01:55:25,270
And also...

2686
01:55:32,690 --> 01:55:33,450
that's so hot.

2687
01:55:36,330 --> 01:55:37,530
Holy shit, Arlo.

2688
01:55:37,590 --> 01:55:38,690
What the fuck was that?

2689
01:55:39,310 --> 01:55:42,610
Bro, this is like the first time he did something actually badass.

2690
01:55:43,950 --> 01:55:44,350
No.

2691
01:55:45,030 --> 01:55:47,950
It's because they are so fucking relaxed that they never get...

2692
01:55:47,950 --> 01:55:49,390
they never get stressed again.

2693
01:55:51,750 --> 01:55:52,970
Like, you won't understand.

2694
01:55:53,510 --> 01:55:54,990
How the fuck do I get to the other side?

2695
01:55:55,670 --> 01:55:59,290
They were so fucking stressed out that they like...

2696
01:55:59,290 --> 01:56:01,190
How the fuck do I get to the other side though?

2697
01:56:01,770 --> 01:56:02,670
They were so stressed out.

2698
01:56:02,690 --> 01:56:08,630
That I relaxed them so much with my massage and acupuncture that like...

2699
01:56:08,630 --> 01:56:10,010
they just never had to come back.

2700
01:56:10,870 --> 01:56:11,750
I basically...

2701
01:56:12,230 --> 01:56:13,650
relieved them of their stress.

2702
01:56:16,670 --> 01:56:17,530
But stop.

2703
01:56:17,670 --> 01:56:18,550
Thank you for the super chat.

2704
01:56:18,650 --> 01:56:19,690
Thank you, thank you, dokey.

2705
01:56:19,730 --> 01:56:20,550
The dream daddy.

2706
01:56:20,650 --> 01:56:21,230
I mean husband.

2707
01:56:22,010 --> 01:56:22,770
Okay, this way.

2708
01:56:22,950 --> 01:56:23,830
Okay, I need to go.

2709
01:56:24,530 --> 01:56:24,970
Alright.

2710
01:56:25,250 --> 01:56:27,010
We need to go this way, Arlo.

2711
01:56:28,670 --> 01:56:29,810
This has to be it.

2712
01:56:29,830 --> 01:56:30,950
There's like tornadoes.

2713
01:56:30,950 --> 01:56:32,610
There's like little mini tornadoes.

2714
01:56:32,690 --> 01:56:32,950
And stuff.

2715
01:56:33,230 --> 01:56:34,950
Oh shit, this is gonna be hard.

2716
01:56:35,330 --> 01:56:36,410
Oh no.

2717
01:56:37,810 --> 01:56:38,850
Oh no.

2718
01:56:39,370 --> 01:56:41,970
I don't like this colossi already.

2719
01:56:42,570 --> 01:56:43,810
Bro, what the fuck?

2720
01:56:44,630 --> 01:56:45,810

01:57:54,900 --> 01:57:56,560
That looks like a cave turtle.

2749
01:57:56,960 --> 01:57:57,780
Is that rock?

2750
01:58:02,060 --> 01:58:03,320

Go back?

2757
01:58:12,340 --> 01:58:12,600
Okay.

2758
01:58:13,960 --> 01:58:14,460
No.

2759
01:58:14,520 --> 01:58:15,660
Go back to the geyser!

2760
01:58:15,720 --> 01:58:16,720

2764
01:58:23,040 --> 01:58:25,240
Where the fuck did I pass it?

2765
01:58:25,320 --> 01:58:26,920
I can't even tell where it is.

2766
01:58:28,180 --> 01:58:29,320

Where the fuck is that guy?

2775
01:58:56,680 --> 01:58:58,640
Where the fuck is this giant ass turtle?

2776
01:58:59,360 --> 01:59:00,200
Is it here?

2777
01:59:00,880 --> 01:59:02,060
Is this a cave?

2778
01:59:03,340 --> 01:59:04,460
This is a cave.

2779
01:59:08,680 --> 01:59:10,740
Hey, you don't need a license to be a life coach.

2780
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:12,120
You just gotta win at life.

2781
01:59:13,360 --> 01:59:18,060
As someone who goes to therapy daily, I am gonna get your life around.

2782
01:59:20,880 --> 01:59:29,440

2783
01:59:29,920 --> 01:59:31,020
I can help you change your life.

2784

Do not worry!

2785
01:59:37,740 --> 01:59:38,820
Do not worry!

2786
01:59:39,160 --> 01:59:39,300
Do not worry!

2787
01:59:39,300 --> 01:59:39,480
Do not worry!

2788
01:59:39,480 --> 01:59:40,480
Where the fuck is the geyser?

2789
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,500
I assume I have to lead him to the geyser.

2790
01:59:43,560 --> 01:59:44,520
And then he goes like...

2791
01:59:44,520 --> 01:59:46,500
Or something.

2792
01:59:48,700 --> 01:59:49,220
Ow.

2793
01:59:49,680 --> 01:59:50,340
It's fine.

2798
01:59:59,180 --> 01:59:59,240
I know what I'm doing!

02:00:21,520 --> 02:00:22,580

02:00:38,520 --> 02:00:39,820
Is it like a little body rub?

2821
02:00:40,340 --> 02:00:41,300
Like, I don't...

2822
02:00:42,080 --> 02:00:42,560

What the fuck do I do?

02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:52,680
Is he...

2825
02:00:52,680 --> 02:00:54,180
Is he getting like a little shower?

2826
02:00:54,460 --> 02:00:55,200
Is he liking that?

2827
02:00:55,540 --> 02:00:56,020

2828
02:00:59,620 --> 02:01:00,600
I'm so confused.

2829
02:01:00,840 --> 02:01:03,180

2830
02:01:09,940 --> 02:01:12,220

2831
02:01:13,960 --> 02:01:15,720

2834
02:01:20,380 --> 02:01:20,880

Don't be a bitch, Arlo!

2838
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:25,920
It's just a little fire.

02:01:29,160 --> 02:01:29,660
I'm flying!

2840
02:01:30,700 --> 02:01:32,880

2841
02:01:33,900 --> 02:01:35,340
Oh, I gotta climb that!

2842
02:01:35,540 --> 02:01:36,420
I gotta climb the tail!

2843
02:01:38,060 --> 02:01:39,900
I gotta climb the tail, right?

2844
02:01:44,700 --> 02:01:45,800
I got you.

2845
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:47,480
No!

2846
02:01:47,480 --> 02:01:47,960
No!

2847
02:01:48,180 --> 02:01:49,160
Get back down!

2848
02:01:49,740 --> 02:01:50,540
I got you.

2849
02:01:51,460 --> 02:01:52,800
Where else would I climb?

2850
02:01:53,720 --> 02:01:54,300
Nice.

2851
02:01:54,300 --> 02:01:54,580
No!

2852
02:01:54,760 --> 02:01:55,220
What?

2853
02:01:55,420 --> 02:01:56,240
What do I climb?

2854
02:01:56,460 --> 02:01:57,040
Shit!

2855
02:01:59,060 --> 02:02:01,080
I cannot climb the tail!

2856
02:02:03,620 --> 02:02:06,520
Okay, I figured it's not the tail.

2857
02:02:06,820 --> 02:02:09,280
It's not the tail.

2858
02:02:13,160 --> 02:02:15,340
Oh, I have to climb the fucking legs?

2859
02:02:17,400 --> 02:02:19,540
Where the fuck do I climb on the legs?

2860
02:02:25,800 --> 02:02:27,740
Oh, I can't shoot that.

2861
02:02:28,040 --> 02:02:29,180
I can't shoot that.

2862
02:02:29,360 --> 02:02:29,540
Arlo!

2863
02:02:29,700 --> 02:02:29,980
Arlo!

2864
02:02:30,080 --> 02:02:30,320
Arlo!

2865
02:02:31,740 --> 02:02:33,540
I'm your favorite owner!

2866
02:02:38,440 --> 02:02:38,960
Arlo!

2867
02:02:39,760 --> 02:02:41,300
I'm your favorite owner!

2868
02:02:44,120 --> 02:02:44,920
Oh god.

2869
02:02:47,860 --> 02:02:48,200
Oh god.

2870
02:02:48,260 --> 02:02:48,620
Oh god.

2871
02:02:49,160 --> 02:02:49,680
Alright.

2872
02:02:51,740 --> 02:02:54,040
I did lead him to the Gaza before.

2873
02:02:54,660 --> 02:02:56,840
Does he have to go to the Gaza again?

2874
02:02:58,480 --> 02:02:59,640
Come to the Gaza.

2875
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:04,120
Come to the Gaza.

2876
02:03:04,720 --> 02:03:06,280
Look at this funny Gaza.

2877
02:03:07,040 --> 02:03:08,880
That's what I assume I have to do.

2878
02:03:10,980 --> 02:03:13,740
Oh, I have to be perfectly under his shell.

2879
02:03:13,980 --> 02:03:14,860
Oh, okay.

2880
02:03:19,140 --> 02:03:20,360
Wait, is that his shell?

2881
02:03:21,240 --> 02:03:21,960
That is!

2882
02:03:22,220 --> 02:03:22,740
That is!

2883
02:03:24,440 --> 02:03:25,700
Oh my god, that is!

2884
02:03:25,980 --> 02:03:26,600
Oh my god.

2885
02:03:31,020 --> 02:03:33,220
How is that not climbing?

2886
02:03:34,380 --> 02:03:37,490
It's hitting me!

2887
02:03:38,070 --> 02:03:39,210
Arlo, please!

2888
02:03:39,850 --> 02:03:40,730
Get up!

2889
02:03:46,070 --> 02:03:47,790
How do I flip him over?

2890
02:03:48,830 --> 02:03:49,410
Help!

2891
02:03:55,940 --> 02:03:58,460
Oh my god, this one fucking sucks.

2892
02:03:58,580 --> 02:04:00,020
I hate this one so much.

2893
02:04:02,240 --> 02:04:03,480
Oh my god.

2894
02:04:03,560 --> 02:04:03,800
Oh my god.

2895
02:04:03,860 --> 02:04:04,720
I'm choking.

2896
02:04:04,980 --> 02:04:05,900
I'm choking already.

2897
02:04:07,380 --> 02:04:08,060
Wait, okay.

2898
02:04:08,200 --> 02:04:09,160
Just stand there again.

2899
02:04:09,380 --> 02:04:10,320
Just stand there again.

2900
02:04:11,520 --> 02:04:13,540
Just make that same mistake, sir.

2901
02:04:16,460 --> 02:04:17,920
Bro, fucking stop!

2902
02:04:17,980 --> 02:04:18,480
Arlo!

2903
02:04:19,440 --> 02:04:19,940
Arlo!

2904
02:04:20,520 --> 02:04:22,420
Let me fucking...

2905
02:04:24,510 --> 02:04:27,880
Oh my god, just stand underneath the Gaza again perfectly.

2906
02:04:28,400 --> 02:04:29,540
Do it again for me.

2907
02:04:29,620 --> 02:04:30,040
Is he...

2908
02:04:30,530 --> 02:04:31,000
Oh, he is.

2909
02:04:31,080 --> 02:04:31,340
He is.

2910
02:04:31,340 --> 02:04:31,620
He is.

2911
02:04:31,620 --> 02:04:31,880
He is.

2912
02:04:31,960 --> 02:04:32,120
Okay.

2913
02:04:32,120 --> 02:04:32,320
Okay.

2914
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:33,480
Okay.

2915
02:04:34,760 --> 02:04:35,580
I'm gonna jump.

2916
02:04:35,600 --> 02:04:36,020
I'm gonna jump.

2917
02:04:36,860 --> 02:04:37,340
No!

2918
02:04:47,510 --> 02:04:48,270
Oh god.

2919
02:04:48,370 --> 02:04:49,010
Oh god.

2920
02:04:49,090 --> 02:04:49,830
Oh god.

2921
02:04:49,890 --> 02:04:50,610
Oh god.

2922
02:04:50,790 --> 02:04:51,390
With what?

2923
02:04:51,430 --> 02:04:52,410
My fucking bow?

2924
02:04:54,970 --> 02:04:56,710
What do I hit him with?

2925
02:05:01,070 --> 02:05:01,710
Oh god.

2926
02:05:02,450 --> 02:05:03,110
Oh god.

2927
02:05:05,710 --> 02:05:07,150
Oh, I see it!

2928
02:05:07,610 --> 02:05:08,710
I see it!

2929
02:05:08,750 --> 02:05:09,270
I see it!

2930
02:05:09,310 --> 02:05:09,670
It's green!

2931
02:05:16,110 --> 02:05:16,610
Okay.

2932
02:05:18,550 --> 02:05:19,050
Poke.

2933
02:05:20,950 --> 02:05:21,450
Poke.

2934
02:05:26,150 --> 02:05:26,650
Poke.

2935
02:05:27,270 --> 02:05:29,070
No, no, no, no, no, no!

2936
02:05:31,090 --> 02:05:31,590
Arlo!

2937
02:05:31,890 --> 02:05:32,390
No!

2938
02:05:32,890 --> 02:05:33,770
No, do it again!

2939
02:05:34,290 --> 02:05:35,490
Do it again, please!

2940
02:05:36,370 --> 02:05:37,370
Please do it!

2941
02:05:39,610 --> 02:05:40,110
No!

2942
02:05:42,490 --> 02:05:42,990
No!

2943
02:05:43,430 --> 02:05:43,930
No!

2944
02:05:44,050 --> 02:05:44,150
No!

2945
02:05:44,510 --> 02:05:44,930
No!

2946
02:05:44,930 --> 02:05:45,490
No!

2947
02:05:45,830 --> 02:05:46,270
No!

2948
02:05:46,270 --> 02:05:46,270
Please!

2949
02:05:46,430 --> 02:05:46,930
Please do it again!

2950
02:05:47,270 --> 02:05:47,710
Please do it again!

2951
02:05:47,710 --> 02:05:48,370
Oh, thank God.

2952
02:05:48,450 --> 02:05:48,730
Please!

2953
02:05:49,490 --> 02:05:50,450
Please just get up!

2954
02:05:53,470 --> 02:05:53,910
Okay.

2955
02:05:54,590 --> 02:05:55,450
Okay, one more.

2956
02:05:56,710 --> 02:05:58,850
Alright, I won't choke this time, I swear.

2957
02:06:01,930 --> 02:06:03,810
Oh my god, I fucking did it!

2958
02:06:04,190 --> 02:06:06,610
Oh my god, I fucking...

2959
02:06:08,530 --> 02:06:08,970
...fucking...

2960
02:06:13,790 --> 02:06:14,910
Oh my god, I...

2961
02:06:14,910 --> 02:06:14,990
Oh my god.

2962
02:06:19,830 --> 02:06:20,570
Okay.

2963
02:06:21,010 --> 02:06:21,750
Go.

2964
02:06:22,490 --> 02:06:23,230
Go.

2965
02:06:23,390 --> 02:06:24,710
Go, Doki.

2966
02:06:24,890 --> 02:06:25,150
Go.

2967
02:06:26,190 --> 02:06:26,930
Go.

2968
02:06:27,690 --> 02:06:28,430
Go!

2969
02:06:31,090 --> 02:06:34,170
I am your personal life coach!

2970
02:06:37,910 --> 02:06:39,350
Do not worry!

2971
02:06:39,990 --> 02:06:42,290
I am here to coach you!

2972
02:06:45,630 --> 02:06:48,050
Where the fuck is it?

2973
02:06:51,290 --> 02:06:53,050
Where do I coach him?

2974
02:06:53,870 --> 02:06:55,170
Where do I...

2975
02:06:56,090 --> 02:06:57,230
I do!

2976
02:06:57,610 --> 02:06:59,730
My sword is literally up!

2977
02:07:00,390 --> 02:07:01,110
No!

2978
02:07:02,130 --> 02:07:02,850
Help

2979
02:07:05,950 --> 02:07:06,110
me!

2980
02:07:06,830 --> 02:07:08,350
This is a fucking flip!

2981
02:07:08,550 --> 02:07:09,890
Where is the geyser?

2982
02:07:10,170 --> 02:07:11,630
Oh my god!

2983
02:07:11,690 --> 02:07:14,150
Where the fuck is the geyser?

2984
02:07:15,390 --> 02:07:17,830
I don't even know where to go.

2985
02:07:18,010 --> 02:07:19,470
I am so lost in this.

2986
02:07:20,990 --> 02:07:21,570
Okay.

2987
02:07:21,670 --> 02:07:22,310
I understand now.

2988
02:07:22,630 --> 02:07:23,550
I understand.

2989
02:07:24,770 --> 02:07:26,510
I understand now, guys.

2990
02:07:26,690 --> 02:07:28,070
I figured it out, guys.

2991
02:07:28,250 --> 02:07:29,610
Don't be disappointed in me.

2992
02:07:29,650 --> 02:07:30,510
I figured it out.

2993
02:07:30,770 --> 02:07:32,210
It took me...

2994
02:07:33,830 --> 02:07:34,410
Look.

2995
02:07:35,390 --> 02:07:39,130
Every person I coach in life is different, okay?

2996
02:07:39,430 --> 02:07:45,050
So like... because of that, I have to like figure out what they want.

2997
02:07:45,110 --> 02:07:46,650
What they want in their lives.

2998
02:07:48,010 --> 02:07:48,450
It's okay.

2999
02:07:48,470 --> 02:07:49,250
I figured it out.

3000
02:07:49,290 --> 02:07:50,430
I just need them to get closer.

3001
02:07:50,870 --> 02:07:51,650
Get closer!

3002
02:07:53,590 --> 02:07:54,330
Get closer!

3003
02:07:55,630 --> 02:07:56,370
Okay, Arlo.

3004
02:07:56,490 --> 02:07:57,490
Please don't get close to me.

3005
02:07:57,510 --> 02:07:58,890
I am talking about this guy.

3006
02:07:59,970 --> 02:08:00,490
Get him on.

3007
02:08:00,550 --> 02:08:01,030
Get over here.

3008
02:08:01,130 --> 02:08:01,910
Walk over here!

3009
02:08:02,470 --> 02:08:02,910
Walk!

3010
02:08:03,830 --> 02:08:05,230
Bro, you can't just be lazy!

3011
02:08:05,590 --> 02:08:07,230
Your mom told you to go outside!

3012
02:08:09,630 --> 02:08:10,070
Okay.

3013
02:08:10,730 --> 02:08:11,170
Okay.

3014
02:08:11,210 --> 02:08:12,290
That is on you, Arlo.

3015
02:08:12,990 --> 02:08:13,870
That is...

3016
02:08:13,870 --> 02:08:16,670
That is a hundred percent on you, Arlo.

3017
02:08:16,670 --> 02:08:18,130
That is not on me.

3018
02:08:18,510 --> 02:08:20,930
That is... not on me, man.

3019
02:08:21,230 --> 02:08:21,990
What the fuck?

3020
02:08:22,110 --> 02:08:23,470
How is he able to do that?

3021
02:08:25,030 --> 02:08:25,590
Oh, wait.

3022
02:08:25,650 --> 02:08:26,150
He gets to...

3023
02:08:26,150 --> 02:08:27,670
Oh, he fucking falls again.

3024
02:08:27,890 --> 02:08:30,770
Oh, I just need to take him to the geyser all the time.

3025
02:08:31,210 --> 02:08:32,150
I get it now.

3026
02:08:33,270 --> 02:08:34,110
I get it.

3027
02:08:34,930 --> 02:08:36,030
Go, go, go, go.

3028
02:08:36,410 --> 02:08:36,810
Go.

3029
02:08:37,550 --> 02:08:38,290
Go, Doki.

3030
02:08:38,370 --> 02:08:38,530
Go.

3031
02:08:41,230 --> 02:08:41,630
Okay.

3032
02:08:42,190 --> 02:08:42,590
Okay.

3033
02:08:43,810 --> 02:08:44,210
Go.

3034
02:08:44,210 --> 02:08:45,010
How do I...

3035
02:08:45,810 --> 02:08:46,210
Go.

3036
02:08:46,210 --> 02:08:46,390
Go.

3037
02:08:47,590 --> 02:08:48,070
Go.

3038
02:08:48,110 --> 02:08:48,310
Go.

3039
02:08:48,310 --> 02:08:48,790
Come on.

3040
02:08:48,830 --> 02:08:49,250
Come on.

3041
02:08:49,910 --> 02:08:50,390
Nice.

3042
02:08:51,070 --> 02:08:51,870
Keep climbing.

3043
02:08:52,770 --> 02:08:53,630
Keep climbing.

3044
02:08:54,910 --> 02:08:56,250
Keep climbing, Doki.

3045
02:08:56,970 --> 02:08:57,810
Keep climbing!

3046
02:08:59,490 --> 02:09:00,450
I am climbing!

3047
02:09:02,090 --> 02:09:03,270
I am doing it!

3048
02:09:06,850 --> 02:09:07,630
Oh my god.

3049
02:09:07,770 --> 02:09:08,930
Please, keep climbing.

3050
02:09:09,890 --> 02:09:10,730
Keep climbing.

3051
02:09:11,850 --> 02:09:12,810
Oh my god.

3052
02:09:12,970 --> 02:09:13,990
No, no, no, no.

3053
02:09:14,830 --> 02:09:15,310
Okay.

3054
02:09:15,310 --> 02:09:15,830
I am just going to hold on.

3055
02:09:17,530 --> 02:09:18,050
Yes!

3056
02:09:20,370 --> 02:09:20,890
Yeah!

3057
02:09:21,070 --> 02:09:21,590
What?

3058
02:09:22,990 --> 02:09:24,030
Holy shit.

3059
02:09:24,170 --> 02:09:25,630
Holy shit.

3060
02:09:25,810 --> 02:09:27,770
What the fuck was that?

3061
02:09:28,010 --> 02:09:28,530
Oh!

3062
02:09:28,970 --> 02:09:29,830
Oh my god.

3063
02:09:30,070 --> 02:09:30,870
Oh my god.

3064
02:09:30,890 --> 02:09:31,150
Please.

3065
02:09:32,190 --> 02:09:32,710
Please!

3066
02:09:32,710 --> 02:09:33,970
Holy shit!

3067
02:09:36,430 --> 02:09:37,810
What do I do?

3068
02:09:38,310 --> 02:09:39,390
What do I do?

3069
02:09:39,470 --> 02:09:39,970
I am stuck!

3070
02:09:42,090 --> 02:09:42,810
Oh god.

3071
02:09:43,170 --> 02:09:43,890
Oh god.

3072
02:09:43,990 --> 02:09:44,650
I made it.

3073
02:09:44,690 --> 02:09:45,070
I made it.

3074
02:09:45,070 --> 02:09:45,890
Oh my god.

3075
02:09:45,950 --> 02:09:46,710
I made it.

3076
02:09:46,750 --> 02:09:48,990
I fucking made it.

3077
02:09:49,090 --> 02:09:49,310
Oh!

3078
02:09:52,270 --> 02:09:52,790
Grip.

3079
02:09:52,790 --> 02:09:53,310
Grip.

3080
02:09:53,370 --> 02:09:55,670
Where the fuck is this fucking...

3081
02:09:55,670 --> 02:09:57,990
Where the fuck is the acupuncture hole?

3082
02:10:01,630 --> 02:10:03,090
Oh, there he is.

3083
02:10:03,270 --> 02:10:03,770
Look.

3084
02:10:03,910 --> 02:10:07,650
I don't want to do this, but your mom was very specific in her instructions.

3085
02:10:11,090 --> 02:10:13,650
Look, you have to get out of that cave.

3086
02:10:14,670 --> 02:10:19,610
Bro, your mom said you've been living in that cave for 20 years.

3087
02:10:21,030 --> 02:10:22,390
After college.

3088
02:10:24,410 --> 02:10:26,950
You haven't seen the thing yet.

3089
02:10:27,050 --> 02:10:30,370
It's like Big Brother, but it's like a one-man show.

3090
02:10:33,950 --> 02:10:35,950
You have to touch grass.

3091
02:10:36,030 --> 02:10:37,550
Your mom is so worried.

3092
02:10:37,550 --> 02:10:39,070
But don't worry.

3093
02:10:39,210 --> 02:10:40,850
Your personal life coach is here.

3094
02:10:41,070 --> 02:10:44,070
And I'm here to get rid of all your worries here.

3095
02:10:44,630 --> 02:10:49,330
This is like a patented... patented Doki Bird special.

3096
02:10:53,570 --> 02:10:55,910
This is what life coaches are for.

3097
02:10:56,010 --> 02:10:56,730
Do not worry.

3098
02:10:59,650 --> 02:11:01,350
Look, you have to go outside.

3099
02:11:01,450 --> 02:11:02,730
Go to the gym.

3100
02:11:03,470 --> 02:11:05,970
And like, touch some grass, man.

3101
02:11:05,970 --> 02:11:08,270
Your mom is so worried.

3102
02:11:08,530 --> 02:11:10,650
I say, what do I do?

3103
02:11:10,830 --> 02:11:12,210
Let's not think about that.

3104
02:11:14,410 --> 02:11:16,690
When did the last time I went outside?

3105
02:11:17,290 --> 02:11:17,890
Let's see.

3106
02:11:17,990 --> 02:11:19,710
Look, I am your life coach.

3107
02:11:19,930 --> 02:11:22,610
My life coach handles me and not you.

3108
02:11:27,030 --> 02:11:28,090
That's different.

3109
02:11:36,020 --> 02:11:37,180
We did it.

3110
02:11:37,460 --> 02:11:41,080
Doki Bird life coach, vet, massage therapist, and lobotomy.

3111
02:11:41,080 --> 02:11:42,920
Thank you for the super chat.

3112
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:43,420
Thank you.

3113
02:11:43,440 --> 02:11:44,100
Thank you.

3114
02:11:47,820 --> 02:11:49,720
Thank you again, first name.

3115
02:11:52,100 --> 02:11:53,840
Yeah, I did it.

3116
02:11:54,120 --> 02:11:55,800
I finally... Look at him.

3117
02:11:55,860 --> 02:11:57,620
He's ready to go outside.

3118
02:11:58,680 --> 02:12:00,240
I took him to grass.

3119
02:12:00,680 --> 02:12:05,860
That is a job well done for the Doki Bird professional life coach.

3120
02:12:06,600 --> 02:12:11,180
I coached him so hard that he went outside and touched some grass.

3121
02:12:12,640 --> 02:12:13,980
Good for him.

3122
02:12:17,140 --> 02:12:18,680
He's so full of life.

3123
02:12:18,880 --> 02:12:19,940
And so alive.

3124
02:12:21,220 --> 02:12:24,280
Oh my god, and his mom carried me back to the temple.

3125
02:12:33,120 --> 02:12:33,720
Yay!

3126
02:12:34,580 --> 02:12:36,240
Another job well done.

3127
02:12:37,580 --> 02:12:39,740
How many more colossi's do I have left?

3128
02:12:39,920 --> 02:12:41,360
Or colossus do I have left?

3129
02:12:42,800 --> 02:12:43,600
Five, right?

3130
02:12:43,840 --> 02:12:44,760
Because I did...

3131
02:12:51,810 --> 02:12:55,090
Now you're gonna meet those colossi Arlo riding skills.

3132
02:12:56,230 --> 02:12:57,730
That was nine, I believe.

3133
02:13:01,610 --> 02:13:03,590
An isolated sand dune.

3134
02:13:03,650 --> 02:13:05,170
Its tracks are well hidden.

3135
02:13:07,830 --> 02:13:08,850
I have six left.

3136
02:13:09,650 --> 02:13:10,550
I did nine?

3137
02:13:10,790 --> 02:13:10,990
Okay.

3138
02:13:11,950 --> 02:13:12,930
I thought I did ten.

3139
02:13:24,670 --> 02:13:25,650
What did I do?

3140
02:13:25,810 --> 02:13:27,030
I only did four today, right?

3141
02:13:28,130 --> 02:13:28,630
Alright.

3142
02:13:29,510 --> 02:13:32,090
It's time to test out my riding skills.

3143
02:13:32,770 --> 02:13:33,710
Alright, don't worry.

3144
02:13:33,810 --> 02:13:38,570
I'm a profeci- You guys have already seen how good I am at driving a horse.

3145
02:13:39,930 --> 02:13:40,750
It's time.

3146
02:13:40,830 --> 02:13:42,610
It's time to go to the sand snakes.

3147
02:13:43,310 --> 02:13:44,750
Alright, pray to save.

3148
02:13:45,450 --> 02:13:46,170
Oh, sorry.

3149
02:13:46,290 --> 02:13:46,810
That's not praying.

3150
02:13:49,890 --> 02:13:50,390
Alright.

3151
02:13:50,710 --> 02:13:52,490
Back to being a massage therapist.

3152
02:13:53,070 --> 02:13:55,570
It was nice experimenting with different jobs.

3153
02:13:55,570 --> 02:13:59,010
But I feel like it's time to go back to what I'm really passionate about.

3154
02:13:59,510 --> 02:14:01,570
De-stressing acupuncture.

3155
02:14:06,370 --> 02:14:07,810
Okay, let's see...

3156
02:14:08,470 --> 02:14:09,130
Where it is.

3157
02:14:09,730 --> 02:14:10,810
It's like this way.

3158
02:14:10,930 --> 02:14:11,150
Okay.

3159
02:14:11,290 --> 02:14:11,950
Alright, Arlo.

3160
02:14:12,310 --> 02:14:13,090
It's time.

3161
02:14:14,290 --> 02:14:16,050
It's time to drive my horse over.

3162
02:14:18,510 --> 02:14:19,470
Alright, here we go.

3163
02:14:20,310 --> 02:14:21,070
This way?

3164
02:14:21,950 --> 02:14:22,770
This way.

3165
02:14:23,030 --> 02:14:23,410
Okay.

3166
02:14:24,150 --> 02:14:24,910
I think?

3167
02:14:25,230 --> 02:14:25,890
It has to be.

3168
02:14:26,190 --> 02:14:27,530
Is it across the ocean again?

3169
02:14:30,090 --> 02:14:31,110
My true passion.

3170
02:14:31,970 --> 02:14:35,370
Being a very licensed massage parlor owner.

3171
02:14:36,370 --> 02:14:38,150
That is my only passion, apparently.

3172
02:14:39,210 --> 02:14:40,970
Which I 100% agree with.

3173
02:14:41,190 --> 02:14:42,670
How the fuck do I get to the other side?

3174
02:14:43,350 --> 02:14:44,550
I think I need to...

3175
02:14:45,230 --> 02:14:46,450
Oh, I need to cross the bridge.

3176
02:14:47,110 --> 02:14:47,590
Sir.

3177
02:14:48,350 --> 02:14:50,390
Okay, I need to cross the bridge to the other side.

3178
02:14:52,710 --> 02:14:53,950
I need to cross it here.

3179
02:14:55,430 --> 02:14:55,910
Right?

3180
02:14:56,310 --> 02:14:57,670
Can I cross it that way?

3181
02:14:58,470 --> 02:14:59,770
Did I go the wrong way?

3182
02:15:00,690 --> 02:15:02,630
Do I cross it here this way?

3183
02:15:03,030 --> 02:15:03,670
I guess?

3184
02:15:05,550 --> 02:15:06,290
Let's see.

3185
02:15:07,330 --> 02:15:09,410
I'm gonna cross this area.

3186
02:15:12,050 --> 02:15:12,530
Here?

3187
02:15:13,370 --> 02:15:13,850
Here?

3188
02:15:13,930 --> 02:15:15,830
And then I go all the way over there?

3189
02:15:19,270 --> 02:15:20,370
Where the fuck is this?

3190
02:15:20,370 --> 02:15:21,610
Okay, I guess I go here?

3191
02:15:22,530 --> 02:15:25,030
And then I go left, I think.

3192
02:15:29,310 --> 02:15:29,770
Alright.

3193
02:15:30,110 --> 02:15:31,770
We're gonna go to the other side now.

3194
02:15:34,290 --> 02:15:34,890
Don't worry.

3195
02:15:36,150 --> 02:15:39,010
This is the furthest appointment I'll have to go.

3196
02:15:39,150 --> 02:15:40,970
But don't worry, Colossus.

3197
02:15:42,750 --> 02:15:46,610
I am a licensed professional and I'll be here to cure all your stress.

3198
02:15:48,950 --> 02:15:49,830
Stupid snake.

3199
02:15:50,710 --> 02:15:52,030
Why are you in the sand?

3200
02:15:55,350 --> 02:15:55,710
Alright.

3201
02:15:55,830 --> 02:15:56,930
I think it's this way, right?

3202
02:15:58,310 --> 02:16:00,250
Where does my sword GPS tell me?

3203
02:16:01,830 --> 02:16:04,770
I need to call my client and tell them that I might be a little late.

3204
02:16:04,850 --> 02:16:07,430
My sword GPS is a little faulty.

3205
02:16:10,050 --> 02:16:12,250
Alright, here we go.

3206
02:16:16,330 --> 02:16:17,150
Oh, my God.

3207
02:16:17,710 --> 02:16:18,070
See?

3208
02:16:18,150 --> 02:16:18,630
Look at that.

3209
02:16:18,810 --> 02:16:19,130
See?

3210
02:16:19,790 --> 02:16:21,570
Look at the way I drive my horse.

3211
02:16:22,770 --> 02:16:24,370
Fucking professional horse driver!

3212
02:16:25,890 --> 02:16:26,370
Woooo!

3213
02:16:30,250 --> 02:16:31,550
Oh, hello birdie!

3214
02:16:32,330 --> 02:16:33,630
Where the fuck is the sand?

3215
02:16:35,270 --> 02:16:36,530
Where is the...

3216
02:16:38,670 --> 02:16:39,590
Where's the sand?

3217
02:16:40,050 --> 02:16:41,210
This is not the sand.

3218
02:16:41,750 --> 02:16:43,030
Am I going the right way?

3219
02:16:43,230 --> 02:16:43,710
I am.

3220
02:16:43,950 --> 02:16:45,290
This is the only way to go.

3221
02:16:48,090 --> 02:16:48,570
Right?

3222
02:16:49,110 --> 02:16:50,690
Yeah, cause that's the ocean.

3223
02:16:51,430 --> 02:16:53,090
So the sand has to be nearby.

3224
02:16:53,090 --> 02:16:55,410
Cause when there's an ocean, there's sand.

3225
02:16:56,330 --> 02:16:57,690
It's on a cave?

3226
02:17:01,200 --> 02:17:02,780
I have to fucking...

3227
02:17:03,320 --> 02:17:04,340
Go downstairs?

3228
02:17:04,580 --> 02:17:05,400
No way.

3229
02:17:05,880 --> 02:17:06,720
There's no way.

3230
02:17:08,920 --> 02:17:10,280
Is Nidoki a horse girl?

3231
02:17:10,440 --> 02:17:11,840
I'm actually not a horse girl.

3232
02:17:11,940 --> 02:17:13,420
I never got to be a horse girl.

3233
02:17:13,680 --> 02:17:16,660
So now, because I never got to be a horse girl...

3234
02:17:16,660 --> 02:17:17,380
I can...

3235
02:17:19,780 --> 02:17:23,580
I can live through it now.

3236
02:17:24,740 --> 02:17:26,300
Cause I never got a chance to.

3237
02:17:27,060 --> 02:17:29,640
I get to see what it was like to be a horse girl.

3238
02:17:34,140 --> 02:17:34,580
Alright.

3239
02:17:36,660 --> 02:17:37,360
Let's see.

3240
02:17:37,640 --> 02:17:38,760
I don't think it's here.

3241
02:17:39,040 --> 02:17:39,460
Is it not?

3242
02:17:39,920 --> 02:17:41,620
Where the fuck is the desert?

3243
02:17:42,180 --> 02:17:43,940
Why does it keep pointing down?

3244
02:17:44,760 --> 02:17:47,560
Oh, it's cause I keep looking down!

3245
02:17:51,970 --> 02:17:53,750
I was like, what is this?

3246
02:17:53,870 --> 02:17:56,710
Okay, that makes a lot more sense.

3247
02:17:56,930 --> 02:17:57,830
Okay, it's this way.

3248
02:17:58,150 --> 02:17:58,590
Alright.

3249
02:17:58,590 --> 02:18:00,450
Guys, I figured it out.

3250
02:18:00,550 --> 02:18:01,650
If you look down...

3251
02:18:01,650 --> 02:18:03,290
The sword... the... the...

3252
02:18:03,290 --> 02:18:05,790
The sword GPS...

3253
02:18:06,550 --> 02:18:07,070
Fucking...

3254
02:18:07,590 --> 02:18:08,650
Takes me downstairs.

3255
02:18:09,650 --> 02:18:11,670
So I just need to not look down.

3256
02:18:11,890 --> 02:18:12,250
Oh, hey.

3257
02:18:12,510 --> 02:18:13,750
Maybe I can grab some HP.

3258
02:18:14,070 --> 02:18:15,210
Have I grabbed HP from you?

3259
02:18:15,270 --> 02:18:17,230
Oh my god, I thought I was gonna fucking die.

3260
02:18:17,970 --> 02:18:20,590
I thought Arlo was gonna send me down to the cliffs.

3261
02:18:21,310 --> 02:18:24,010
Okay, did I chew the fruit from here before?

3262
02:18:24,270 --> 02:18:25,390
No, oh I didn't.

3263
02:18:25,390 --> 02:18:25,730
Alright.

3264
02:18:27,010 --> 02:18:27,850
Okay, whoops.

3265
02:18:27,850 --> 02:18:29,150
That was the camera.

3266
02:18:30,670 --> 02:18:31,170
Alright.

3267
02:18:31,550 --> 02:18:32,050
Boop!

3268
02:18:32,230 --> 02:18:33,430
That has to be one of the fruits.

3269
02:18:36,070 --> 02:18:36,570
Eat.

3270
02:18:37,510 --> 02:18:38,010
Nice.

3271
02:18:38,790 --> 02:18:40,430
Yeah, I don't have a lot of stamina.

3272
02:18:40,730 --> 02:18:42,070
I haven't been finding shrines.

3273
02:18:42,530 --> 02:18:43,430
There's another one.

3274
02:18:44,410 --> 02:18:45,390
Get away, Arlo.

3275
02:18:48,490 --> 02:18:48,990
Alright.

3276
02:18:51,990 --> 02:18:53,890
Where the fuck did the fruits drop to?

3277
02:18:54,130 --> 02:18:54,630
Hello?

3278
02:18:54,770 --> 02:18:55,350
Oh, here.

3279
02:18:56,030 --> 02:18:56,530
Yay!

3280
02:18:58,070 --> 02:18:58,630
And...

3281
02:18:58,630 --> 02:18:59,390
Fruit!

3282
02:19:00,450 --> 02:19:01,010
Fruit!

3283
02:19:01,810 --> 02:19:02,370
Nice.

3284
02:19:03,090 --> 02:19:05,630
Alright, time to figure out where the desert is.

3285
02:19:07,790 --> 02:19:09,930
Okay, time to go to Snake Boy.

3286
02:19:10,930 --> 02:19:11,770
The fuck?

3287
02:19:11,850 --> 02:19:12,510
Oh, nope.

3288
02:19:13,890 --> 02:19:16,130
GPS sword, where do you- oh, sorry.

3289
02:19:16,270 --> 02:19:16,930
Not in the sun.

3290
02:19:17,910 --> 02:19:18,830
GPS sword!

3291
02:19:19,150 --> 02:19:20,390
Tell me where to go!

3292
02:19:24,050 --> 02:19:25,910
Alright, GPS sword has spoken.

3293
02:19:26,570 --> 02:19:27,330
Alright, Arlo.

3294
02:19:27,330 --> 02:19:27,410
Arlo.

3295
02:19:27,910 --> 02:19:28,810
Get over here.

3296
02:19:29,910 --> 02:19:31,210
Look, I'm a good owner.

3297
02:19:33,310 --> 02:19:34,030
Alright, Arlo.

3298
02:19:34,890 --> 02:19:37,670
Apparently I need you to help me with the snake.

3299
02:19:39,890 --> 02:19:41,050
It's always a cave?

3300
02:19:41,250 --> 02:19:42,430
Why are they always all in caves?

3301
02:19:44,410 --> 02:19:45,670
What happened to them?

3302
02:19:47,350 --> 02:19:48,950
Why is it always a cave?

3303
02:19:51,570 --> 02:19:52,970
This has to be sound, right?

3304
02:19:54,130 --> 02:19:54,890
Is this it?

3305
02:19:54,890 --> 02:19:54,890
What?

3306
02:19:56,090 --> 02:19:57,630
No, that's not sand.

3307
02:19:57,710 --> 02:19:58,790
That's normal grass.

3308
02:20:01,210 --> 02:20:02,270
No one tell... Oh!

3309
02:20:02,270 --> 02:20:02,570
Oh!

3310
02:20:02,590 --> 02:20:02,910
Shrine!

3311
02:20:03,490 --> 02:20:03,930
Shrine!

3312
02:20:05,210 --> 02:20:06,550
Wait, have I been to the shrine before?

3313
02:20:07,150 --> 02:20:07,950
No, I haven't.

3314
02:20:07,950 --> 02:20:08,350
This is new.

3315
02:20:10,030 --> 02:20:10,890
Oh god, okay.

3316
02:20:11,250 --> 02:20:11,890
Alright, Arlo.

3317
02:20:12,510 --> 02:20:13,450
Oh, there it is!

3318
02:20:13,470 --> 02:20:13,930
There's a cave!

3319
02:20:15,510 --> 02:20:16,590
There's a sand cave!

3320
02:20:16,790 --> 02:20:19,850
I knew my GPS sword will take me to the right place.

3321
02:20:21,150 --> 02:20:22,370
Okay, time to pray.

3322
02:20:22,770 --> 02:20:24,490
Wait, this is not... Wait, what?

3323
02:20:26,210 --> 02:20:28,210
Okay, I was like, wait a minute.

3324
02:20:28,670 --> 02:20:29,390
Time to pray.

3325
02:20:30,970 --> 02:20:32,570
Alright, where the fuck is the gecko?

3326
02:20:33,750 --> 02:20:36,810
Now that I've fixed the iguana problem...

3327
02:20:37,770 --> 02:20:39,250
This should be... Oh, there he is.

3328
02:20:43,410 --> 02:20:44,190
Arlo, please.

3329
02:20:45,210 --> 02:20:45,650
Okay.

3330
02:20:46,150 --> 02:20:47,050
Is he dead dead?

3331
02:20:47,210 --> 02:20:47,650
No.

3332
02:20:47,890 --> 02:20:48,610
Now he is.

3333
02:20:48,830 --> 02:20:49,170
Alright.

3334
02:20:49,430 --> 02:20:50,670
You always gotta double tap.

3335
02:20:50,890 --> 02:20:51,710
What the fuck?

3336
02:20:52,230 --> 02:20:52,810
You're alive?

3337
02:20:53,710 --> 02:20:54,190
Oh, it's okay.

3338
02:20:54,270 --> 02:20:55,270
He can regrow the tail!

3339
02:20:56,310 --> 02:20:59,230
I let him live on purpose, cause I found out.

3340
02:20:59,330 --> 02:21:01,210
You can regrow the tail.

3341
02:21:01,430 --> 02:21:02,670
You come back to the shrine.

3342
02:21:03,030 --> 02:21:05,030
And then like, the tail will grow back.

3343
02:21:05,570 --> 02:21:06,010
Real.

3344
02:21:06,630 --> 02:21:09,010
Just from the Doki Bird exclusive.

3345
02:21:09,710 --> 02:21:10,850
You guys might not know that.

3346
02:21:10,930 --> 02:21:12,110
It's like a hidden Easter egg.

3347
02:21:12,750 --> 02:21:14,890
The tail will regrow, so you have to...

3348
02:21:14,890 --> 02:21:18,050
The thing is, you have to like, shoot it at the tail.

3349
02:21:18,130 --> 02:21:19,690
At the right part of the tail.

3350
02:21:19,910 --> 02:21:20,870
So like...

3351
02:21:21,890 --> 02:21:23,930
Mostly people, when they shoot it, they kill the lizard.

3352
02:21:24,130 --> 02:21:28,150
But like, if you're as skilled as me, you can shoot at the tail.

3353
02:21:28,350 --> 02:21:30,430
That only the tail comes off.

3354
02:21:30,550 --> 02:21:31,410
And not the lizard.

3355
02:21:31,410 --> 02:21:32,210
The lizard doesn't die.

3356
02:21:32,550 --> 02:21:36,090
So like, I know like a lot of people might not be as skillful at shooting as me.

3357
02:21:36,290 --> 02:21:37,130
But like...

3358
02:21:39,670 --> 02:21:41,250
But here's a little pro tip.

3359
02:21:42,550 --> 02:21:43,870
It's a one frame trick.

3360
02:21:44,470 --> 02:21:45,410
That I mastered.

3361
02:21:45,690 --> 02:21:47,570
Also, you have to shoot at the right angle.

3362
02:21:47,790 --> 02:21:49,130
So like, you come back to the shrine.

3363
02:21:49,350 --> 02:21:50,970
And then the lizard will have...

3364
02:21:50,970 --> 02:21:52,570
It's how you can farm unlimited stamina.

3365
02:21:55,090 --> 02:21:57,010
Alright, how the fuck do I kill this snake?

3366
02:21:57,750 --> 02:22:00,390
Do I just ride around and then just jump on the back?

3367
02:22:02,030 --> 02:22:02,710
Oh god.

3368
02:22:05,270 --> 02:22:06,630
He seems very angry.

3369
02:22:08,450 --> 02:22:09,430
Do not worry.

3370
02:22:09,530 --> 02:22:10,130
Oh my god.

3371
02:22:10,170 --> 02:22:10,970
It's the anger stress.

3372
02:22:11,250 --> 02:22:12,790
You know when you're so stressed out, you're just angry?

3373
02:22:13,410 --> 02:22:14,210
That's just him.

3374
02:22:14,330 --> 02:22:14,770
Don't worry.

3375
02:22:14,830 --> 02:22:15,290
That's why he...

3376
02:22:15,290 --> 02:22:17,470
That's why I got hired in the first place!

3377
02:22:18,030 --> 02:22:19,390
My word of mouth!

3378
02:22:20,970 --> 02:22:22,330
My word of mouth is working!

3379
02:22:22,790 --> 02:22:26,450
I don't need to waste money advertising and getting YouTube ads.

3380
02:22:27,030 --> 02:22:31,130
My happy clients are advertising about my great...

3381
02:22:31,130 --> 02:22:32,250
My great...

3382
02:22:32,250 --> 02:22:35,310
My great work ethics.

3383
02:22:37,370 --> 02:22:39,270
How do I fucking kill him?

3384
02:22:39,450 --> 02:22:40,730
Don't step on the snake?

3385
02:22:40,870 --> 02:22:42,370
But what if I want to step on the snake?

3386
02:22:44,190 --> 02:22:45,290
What the fuck?

3387
02:22:46,710 --> 02:22:47,850
What the fuck?

3388
02:22:52,410 --> 02:22:52,930
Oh!

3389
02:22:52,930 --> 02:22:54,610
Wait, I'm getting sucked in!

3390
02:22:56,330 --> 02:22:57,730
Come on, I get it.

3391
02:22:57,810 --> 02:22:58,190
I get it.

3392
02:23:01,650 --> 02:23:02,170
Okay.

3393
02:23:02,170 --> 02:23:03,250
I get it now.

3394
02:23:03,550 --> 02:23:04,930
I was getting sucked in.

3395
02:23:04,990 --> 02:23:05,970
I was losing HP!

3396
02:23:06,130 --> 02:23:08,810
I just realized I was losing HP!

3397
02:23:11,890 --> 02:23:13,190
I was like, whoa!

3398
02:23:13,470 --> 02:23:17,030
I definitely did not fucking have that low HP when I started.

3399
02:23:19,590 --> 02:23:21,190
I couldn't tell!

3400
02:23:21,570 --> 02:23:23,530
I couldn't tell, guys!

3401
02:23:24,690 --> 02:23:26,070
Is he...

3402
02:23:26,070 --> 02:23:27,070
Whoa!

3403
02:23:28,810 --> 02:23:30,490
Bro, he's a crocodile!

3404
02:23:32,670 --> 02:23:34,150
It's a crocodile snake!

3405
02:23:35,990 --> 02:23:37,210
Holy shit!

3406
02:23:37,410 --> 02:23:38,630
Oh my god!

3407
02:23:38,690 --> 02:23:40,010
Do I have to shoot the eye?

3408
02:23:41,650 --> 02:23:44,690
Are you fucking... How do I...

3409
02:23:44,690 --> 02:23:46,470
Oh my god!

3410
02:23:46,570 --> 02:23:47,530
I figured it out!

3411
02:23:47,630 --> 02:23:48,550
I have to shoot the eye.

3412
02:23:48,730 --> 02:23:49,810
I figured it out.

3413
02:23:50,570 --> 02:23:51,710
Oh my god.

3414
02:23:51,770 --> 02:23:53,350
Can... Does he... He's gonna run into the wall.

3415
02:23:53,470 --> 02:23:54,030
Oh my god.

3416
02:23:54,070 --> 02:23:55,790
Okay, I thought Arlo can like...

3417
02:23:55,790 --> 02:23:57,250
figure this out himself.

3418
02:23:59,050 --> 02:24:01,630
I like looked back and I saw eyes.

3419
02:24:01,890 --> 02:24:02,430
I was like...

3420
02:24:02,430 --> 02:24:04,650
I have to shoot the eye.

3421
02:24:09,610 --> 02:24:10,810
Oh my god.

3422
02:24:10,850 --> 02:24:11,350
Don't worry.

3423
02:24:11,890 --> 02:24:13,730
As we all know...

3424
02:24:14,690 --> 02:24:14,930
The...

3425
02:24:15,690 --> 02:24:17,170
Okay, this... You guys might not...

3426
02:24:17,170 --> 02:24:20,190
Actually, you guys actually might not know this because you're not into acupuncture.

3427
02:24:20,330 --> 02:24:22,530
But like, the most risky...

3428
02:24:22,530 --> 02:24:23,250
Alright.

3429
02:24:23,370 --> 02:24:27,690
The most expensive acupuncture job is...

3430
02:24:27,690 --> 02:24:28,730
Are you serious?

3431
02:24:29,050 --> 02:24:30,290
Did he fucking hit the rock?

3432
02:24:33,970 --> 02:24:34,530
Come on.

3433
02:24:36,510 --> 02:24:42,030
The most expensive acupuncture job out there is the eye of acupuncture.

3434
02:24:42,310 --> 02:24:44,110
Like, you gotta be super...

3435
02:24:44,890 --> 02:24:48,110
You gotta be like super fucking prist...

3436
02:24:48,690 --> 02:24:51,430
You gotta be like super precise with this.

3437
02:24:51,550 --> 02:24:52,750
But do not worry.

3438
02:24:52,890 --> 02:24:54,470
I am a professional.

3439
02:24:55,130 --> 02:24:56,850
Please, please, please, please, please, please.

3440
02:24:57,250 --> 02:24:57,990
Where do you eye?

3441
02:24:58,110 --> 02:24:58,570
Where do you eye?

3442
02:24:58,710 --> 02:24:59,310
Where do you eye?

3443
02:24:59,370 --> 02:24:59,890
Where do you eye?

3444
02:25:02,770 --> 02:25:03,850
There we go.

3445
02:25:05,090 --> 02:25:06,050
Eye acupuncture.

3446
02:25:12,270 --> 02:25:13,810
Do not worry.

3447
02:25:16,150 --> 02:25:16,710
Okay.

3448
02:25:16,830 --> 02:25:17,990
Oh, I found it instantly.

3449
02:25:18,650 --> 02:25:19,210
Yes.

3450
02:25:19,310 --> 02:25:23,010
For when you shoot the eye, you reveal the...

3451
02:25:23,010 --> 02:25:24,290
All the stress points.

3452
02:25:27,130 --> 02:25:28,890
Yeah, that guy has some fucking...

3453
02:25:28,890 --> 02:25:29,310
Fucking...

3454
02:25:29,310 --> 02:25:30,790
That's when you know.

3455
02:25:31,750 --> 02:25:34,790
Like, that eye, you know he needed eye acupuncture.

3456
02:25:35,330 --> 02:25:36,030
Right there.

3457
02:25:36,030 --> 02:25:38,850
I basically relieved all the eye stress from him.

3458
02:25:39,330 --> 02:25:41,130
Oh shit, he fucking buried me.

3459
02:25:41,230 --> 02:25:41,690
Oh my god.

3460
02:25:41,750 --> 02:25:41,950
Okay.

3461
02:25:42,630 --> 02:25:43,030
Arlo.

3462
02:25:43,210 --> 02:25:43,610
Arlo.

3463
02:25:44,030 --> 02:25:44,430
Arlo.

3464
02:25:44,870 --> 02:25:46,210
We gotta get the other eye.

3465
02:25:46,350 --> 02:25:46,670
Arlo.

3466
02:25:47,570 --> 02:25:48,310
Oh my god.

3467
02:25:48,370 --> 02:25:49,450
I need a fucking eye.

3468
02:25:49,990 --> 02:25:50,850
Arlo, don't worry.

3469
02:25:52,490 --> 02:25:53,370
Don't worry, Arlo.

3470
02:25:55,850 --> 02:25:57,010
I am a professional.

3471
02:25:59,670 --> 02:26:00,070
Okay.

3472
02:26:00,210 --> 02:26:01,450
He has to go this way, right?

3473
02:26:02,370 --> 02:26:02,770
Yeah.

3474
02:26:02,850 --> 02:26:04,130
He has to follow me from behind.

3475
02:26:04,350 --> 02:26:04,970
What the fuck?

3476
02:26:06,030 --> 02:26:06,750
Now he can jump.

3477
02:26:07,570 --> 02:26:08,810
That's when you know he liked it.

3478
02:26:13,570 --> 02:26:14,230
It's okay.

3479
02:26:14,330 --> 02:26:15,950
It's because he's been looking at the PC.

3480
02:26:16,070 --> 02:26:18,550
When you look at the PC for too long for a lot...

3481
02:26:18,550 --> 02:26:18,890
For...

3482
02:26:18,890 --> 02:26:25,290
When you look at the PC for too long for like majority of your life, you gotta get eye acupuncture.

3483
02:26:25,670 --> 02:26:28,410
But like you have to get it with a real professional like me.

3484
02:26:28,610 --> 02:26:29,530
So if you have...

3485
02:26:29,530 --> 02:26:33,330
If you see this license from any specialist, that's what...

3486
02:26:33,330 --> 02:26:33,970
That like...

3487
02:26:33,970 --> 02:26:35,530
My particular license.

3488
02:26:36,210 --> 02:26:40,010
States that like I am allowed to perform eye acu- Acu-puncture.

3489
02:26:41,650 --> 02:26:43,270
Where the fuck is he so slow?

3490
02:26:44,310 --> 02:26:45,330
Show up!

3491
02:26:50,070 --> 02:26:51,110
Only one.

3492
02:26:52,590 --> 02:26:53,150
One.

3493
02:26:54,190 --> 02:26:55,830
Arlo, what are you doing?

3494
02:27:01,610 --> 02:27:03,310
Shit, that was so scary.

3495
02:27:03,310 --> 02:27:05,230
What the fuck!

3496
02:27:05,370 --> 02:27:05,830
Okay!

3497
02:27:10,630 --> 02:27:13,910
Oh my god, that was so fucking scary, man.

3498
02:27:15,950 --> 02:27:18,210
Arlo, Arlo, Arlo, Arlo, I don't like that.

3499
02:27:18,250 --> 02:27:19,110
I don't like that, Arlo.

3500
02:27:20,690 --> 02:27:22,370
Where the fuck is the eye?

3501
02:27:22,530 --> 02:27:23,690
Open your eye!

3502
02:27:26,330 --> 02:27:29,950
Bro, only one out of five specialists?

3503
02:27:30,550 --> 02:27:31,650
Oh, wait.

3504
02:27:31,810 --> 02:27:32,630
He's tired?

3505
02:27:33,630 --> 02:27:34,970
Why is he tired?

3506
02:27:36,910 --> 02:27:39,570
Only one out of five specialists can perform this.

3507
02:27:40,830 --> 02:27:41,270
Oh!

3508
02:27:41,270 --> 02:27:43,810
I get tired from fucking drawing my bow.

3509
02:27:44,150 --> 02:27:45,390
I didn't even realize that.

3510
02:27:45,630 --> 02:27:47,010
I'm so fucking weak.

3511
02:27:51,390 --> 02:27:52,250
Oh shit.

3512
02:27:52,450 --> 02:27:53,290
Oh shit.

3513
02:27:53,530 --> 02:27:54,150
Oh shit.

3514
02:27:54,190 --> 02:27:57,470
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

3515
02:27:58,030 --> 02:27:58,970
Go, go, go.

3516
02:28:00,490 --> 02:28:01,370
Go, go, go.

3517
02:28:01,850 --> 02:28:02,490
No, no!

3518
02:28:02,690 --> 02:28:03,290
Oh, that hurt!

3519
02:28:03,310 --> 02:28:03,610
Did I hit him?

3520
02:28:04,330 --> 02:28:05,130
Did I hit him?

3521
02:28:05,130 --> 02:28:05,730
I did, right?

3522
02:28:07,930 --> 02:28:09,090
Did I hit him?!

3523
02:28:09,910 --> 02:28:10,550
Oh, I did.

3524
02:28:10,650 --> 02:28:11,310
Okay, thank god.

3525
02:28:12,010 --> 02:28:12,890
I couldn't tell.

3526
02:28:13,910 --> 02:28:15,090
I actually couldn't tell.

3527
02:28:17,350 --> 02:28:18,670
Oh my god, I couldn't tell.

3528
02:28:21,030 --> 02:28:21,570
Get off.

3529
02:28:21,590 --> 02:28:22,150
Get off the horse.

3530
02:28:23,630 --> 02:28:23,950
Okay.

3531
02:28:24,170 --> 02:28:26,090
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

3532
02:28:26,650 --> 02:28:27,910
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

3533
02:28:28,250 --> 02:28:28,950
Go, go, go, go.

3534
02:28:28,990 --> 02:28:29,910
Where the fuck is your...

3535
02:28:30,350 --> 02:28:31,710
Where the fuck is your stress?

3536
02:28:31,710 --> 02:28:31,930
Stress!

3537
02:28:32,010 --> 02:28:34,110
Where are you stress my boy?

3538
02:28:36,390 --> 02:28:38,870
Okay, I found the stress point.

3539
02:28:39,310 --> 02:28:39,990
Bam!

3540
02:28:41,510 --> 02:28:42,350
Don't worry!

3541
02:28:43,830 --> 02:28:48,070
Five clients recommend me!

3542
02:28:48,750 --> 02:28:51,830
The fifth one forgot to leave a review.

3543
02:28:59,190 --> 02:29:00,510
There we go.

3544
02:29:00,790 --> 02:29:01,630
We did it!

3545
02:29:03,650 --> 02:29:05,450
The fifth one just forgot to leave the review.

3546
02:29:05,770 --> 02:29:09,210
We did it!

3547
02:29:09,430 --> 02:29:10,830
We cured stress!

3548
02:29:12,510 --> 02:29:15,450
Call me for an eye acupuncture.

3549
02:29:15,610 --> 02:29:17,730
One out of five specialists and I'm the cheapest one.

3550
02:29:18,070 --> 02:29:19,630
Not because I'm bad at it.

3551
02:29:19,710 --> 02:29:23,110
It's because I know being a specialist is like...

3552
02:29:23,110 --> 02:29:25,570
I know we're really in demand.

3553
02:29:25,950 --> 02:29:28,270
And because I care about the people.

3554
02:29:28,530 --> 02:29:29,490
I'm the people.

3555
02:29:29,710 --> 02:29:32,330
I care about the people so I make sure I'm super affordable.

3556
02:29:32,590 --> 02:29:33,630
For those who need it.

3557
02:29:33,650 --> 02:29:34,530
I need eye acupuncture.

3558
02:29:34,870 --> 02:29:38,050
That's why it's like I'm like the cheapest out of all four or five of them.

3559
02:29:38,990 --> 02:29:41,050
I do it for the people.

3560
02:29:47,630 --> 02:29:49,690
Yeah, I gotta make it like financially available.

3561
02:29:49,770 --> 02:29:51,270
It's like... it's like... what is it?

3562
02:29:51,330 --> 02:29:51,650
Insulin.

3563
02:29:53,550 --> 02:29:54,310
It's like insulin.

3564
02:29:54,470 --> 02:29:56,610
I'm like that guy that tried to make insulin cheaper.

3565
02:29:56,810 --> 02:29:57,250
That's me.

3566
02:29:57,570 --> 02:30:00,630
I wouldn't like let big pharma take advantage of you.

3567
02:30:04,980 --> 02:30:05,500
Yay!

3568
02:30:13,230 --> 02:30:14,450
I did it.

3569
02:30:15,750 --> 02:30:17,490
What does God want me to do now?

3570
02:30:18,010 --> 02:30:19,010
Who's the next one?

3571
02:30:26,730 --> 02:30:27,790
Galerian set loose.

3572
02:30:27,850 --> 02:30:28,630
It keeps the...

3573
02:30:28,630 --> 02:30:29,310
Oh wait, fire.

3574
02:30:30,150 --> 02:30:31,770
This is a fire guardian.

3575
02:30:31,890 --> 02:30:33,110
The fire colossus.

3576
02:30:36,360 --> 02:30:37,620
Is this another lake?

3577
02:30:41,760 --> 02:30:42,740
Oh my God.

3578
02:30:42,920 --> 02:30:43,680
You know what?

3579
02:30:43,820 --> 02:30:45,520
I think this is the perfect time to call it.

3580
02:30:49,100 --> 02:30:49,840
We'll do...

3581
02:30:50,400 --> 02:30:51,640
We'll do the last...

3582
02:30:51,640 --> 02:30:54,700
The last six on another stream.

3583
02:30:58,340 --> 02:30:59,260
I don't want...

3584
02:30:59,260 --> 02:31:00,860
I don't want to find another lake.

3585
02:31:00,900 --> 02:31:01,860
Let's pray right now.

3586
02:31:02,240 --> 02:31:02,960
Let's pray.

3587
02:31:03,360 --> 02:31:04,040
Pray time.

3588
02:31:04,900 --> 02:31:05,380
Yay!

3589
02:31:07,120 --> 02:31:09,060
I think we made a lot of good progress.

3590
02:31:09,300 --> 02:31:09,780
Chat.

3591
02:31:10,600 --> 02:31:13,160
We made so much progress today.

3592
02:31:13,480 --> 02:31:14,080
Guys.

3593
02:31:14,660 --> 02:31:16,600
We made so much progress.

3594
02:31:16,740 --> 02:31:17,100
Yeah.

3595
02:31:20,020 --> 02:31:21,140
Alright, let me...

3596
02:31:22,020 --> 02:31:23,660
Let me swap screens.

3597
02:31:24,980 --> 02:31:25,580
Yay!

3598
02:31:26,340 --> 02:31:26,760
Oh my God.

3599
02:31:26,800 --> 02:31:27,680
I did it.

3600
02:31:28,580 --> 02:31:29,420
There you go.

3601
02:31:32,420 --> 02:31:33,800
Did I pray?

3602
02:31:34,120 --> 02:31:35,400
I'm going to pray again just in case.

3603
02:31:35,980 --> 02:31:37,460
That was really fun though.

3604
02:31:37,460 --> 02:31:40,540
This game has been like super enjoyable so far.

3605
02:31:40,700 --> 02:31:43,380
I'm really glad I actually got a chance...

3606
02:31:43,380 --> 02:31:52,100
I actually get the chance to keep playing Shadow Colossus because it's been like super fun so far and definitely like...

3607
02:31:54,220 --> 02:31:57,060
I really enjoyed playing it for the very first time.

3608
02:31:57,280 --> 02:31:59,360
But I'm going to do something about super chat reading.

3609
02:31:59,540 --> 02:32:05,840
We haven't done those in so long because I've always been so busy and I still am very busy.

3610
02:32:08,020 --> 02:32:09,960
But I figured today's the day.

3611
02:32:10,380 --> 02:32:12,540
Today's the day we do super chat reading.

3612
02:32:12,720 --> 02:32:18,460
Let me find the text that pops up and be like doing super chat reading right now.

3613
02:32:18,620 --> 02:32:19,520
Where the fuck is it?

3614
02:32:19,580 --> 02:32:20,120
Oh my God.

3615
02:32:20,340 --> 02:32:25,200
It's been so long that I can't even find like the little text that tells people I'm doing super chat reading.

3616
02:32:25,440 --> 02:32:26,320
Oh, there it is.

3617
02:32:26,420 --> 02:32:27,560
I just didn't color code it.

3618
02:32:27,760 --> 02:32:28,200
Alright.

3619
02:32:28,400 --> 02:32:28,840
Colors.

3620
02:32:29,340 --> 02:32:29,780
Alright.

3621
02:32:30,020 --> 02:32:31,140
Donation reading time!

3622
02:32:31,920 --> 02:32:32,360
Yeah!

3623
02:32:33,060 --> 02:32:33,880
I had a really fun.

3624
02:32:34,220 --> 02:32:34,820
It's been like...

3625
02:32:34,820 --> 02:32:36,240
We're going to finish this.

3626
02:32:36,420 --> 02:32:37,440
We're going to finish Shadow Colossus.

3627
02:32:37,440 --> 02:32:38,920
I'm going to finish Shadow Colossus next week guys.

3628
02:32:39,260 --> 02:32:39,980
Don't worry.

3629
02:32:40,260 --> 02:32:42,500
Next week we're going to 100% finish it.

3630
02:32:42,780 --> 02:32:45,540
I just figured like I didn't want to do like a super long stream.

3631
02:32:46,500 --> 02:32:51,440
Like I don't want to force myself to do all the Colossus today.

3632
02:32:51,560 --> 02:32:58,160
So I purposely wanted to leave it the all the rest for last stream because I don't know how long it's going to take me.

3633
02:33:00,360 --> 02:33:06,100
I don't know how long the last six Colossus are going to take me.

3634
02:33:06,160 --> 02:33:06,860
So I was like, you know what?

3635
02:33:06,860 --> 02:33:09,600
I'm gonna leave it to the last stream just in case.

3636
02:33:09,780 --> 02:33:12,520
Just in case I get fucked up.

3637
02:33:16,680 --> 02:33:17,400
Let's see.

3638
02:33:18,400 --> 02:33:19,300
It's been a while.

3639
02:33:19,820 --> 02:33:21,920
I almost forgot how to do a Super Chat reading.

3640
02:33:22,800 --> 02:33:24,860
Pull it up real fast.

3641
02:33:29,840 --> 02:33:31,380
Alright, where was I?

3642
02:33:31,660 --> 02:33:32,360
Let's see.

3643
02:33:33,620 --> 02:33:34,020
Uh...

3644
02:33:34,680 --> 02:33:35,080

3645
02:33:35,140 --> 02:33:36,100
Thank you for the Super Chat!

3646
02:33:36,160 --> 02:33:36,460
Thank you!

3647
02:33:36,480 --> 02:33:37,080
Thank you!

3648
02:33:37,420 --> 02:33:38,640
Horse Girl Streams!

3649
02:33:38,640 --> 02:33:38,860
Woo!

3650
02:33:39,580 --> 02:33:39,980
Ginger!

3651
02:33:40,140 --> 02:33:40,820
Thank you for the Super Chat!

3652
02:33:40,900 --> 02:33:41,120
Thank you!

3653
02:33:41,140 --> 02:33:41,600
Thank you!

3654
02:33:41,880 --> 02:33:43,000
Not so deadpua!

3655
02:33:43,260 --> 02:33:44,160
Please, Dokie.

3656
02:33:44,220 --> 02:33:45,640
I don't want to see the stamina bar.

3657
02:33:45,740 --> 02:33:46,940
It distracts me!

3658
02:33:47,080 --> 02:33:48,300
Thank you for the Super Chat!

3659
02:33:48,440 --> 02:33:48,920
Thank you!

3660
02:33:48,940 --> 02:33:49,660
Thank you!

3661
02:33:52,240 --> 02:33:52,640
Look.

3662
02:33:53,260 --> 02:33:54,600
I am so nice.

3663
02:33:54,880 --> 02:33:57,620
I'm so nice I actually showed you guys the stamina bar.

3664
02:33:58,200 --> 02:33:59,880
I usually never do that.

3665
02:34:00,060 --> 02:34:00,920
You guys have to remember.

3666
02:34:01,160 --> 02:34:02,340
This is like a once in a lifetime.

3667
02:34:02,360 --> 02:34:02,680
opportunity.

3668
02:34:05,140 --> 02:34:05,800
Let's see.

3669
02:34:09,780 --> 02:34:10,280
Kaz!

3670
02:34:10,400 --> 02:34:11,260
Thank you for the Super Chat!

3671
02:34:11,380 --> 02:34:11,620
Thank you!

3672
02:34:11,660 --> 02:34:12,220
Thank you!

3673
02:34:15,860 --> 02:34:18,900
The art contest for your gamer sub started at 5th, right?

3674
02:34:18,940 --> 02:34:20,880
Did you have any specific details for the artist entering?

3675
02:34:21,180 --> 02:34:22,500
Alright, so there's been a delay.

3676
02:34:22,760 --> 02:34:28,640
Since there's been no details regarding the art contest.

3677
02:34:28,680 --> 02:34:32,340
Because we're working on the graphic right now for the art contest.

3678
02:34:32,340 --> 02:34:36,380
There was like some delay because we're like finalizing the rules and everything.

3679
02:34:37,460 --> 02:34:40,240
But so don't worry because I didn't post anything.

3680
02:34:40,460 --> 02:34:42,980
It just means like the official contest isn't out yet.

3681
02:34:43,780 --> 02:34:48,400
But the moment I get the graphics for the to post it.

3682
02:34:48,660 --> 02:34:51,080
That's when like, you know, boom, we start.

3683
02:34:53,320 --> 02:34:53,800
So.

3684
02:34:57,440 --> 02:35:00,860
So that's just like that's just basically it.

3685
02:35:00,860 --> 02:35:04,400
The reason why they're like, you know, I know we said 5th, but there's been delays and stuff.

3686
02:35:04,460 --> 02:35:07,720
There's just a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes every day.

3687
02:35:07,780 --> 02:35:12,980
I've been like super duper busy because there's been so many things that delay like not delayed.

3688
02:35:13,200 --> 02:35:16,360
But like there's just been a lot of things that's just being worked on.

3689
02:35:16,440 --> 02:35:19,020
Like it takes longer to process and stuff like that.

3690
02:35:19,220 --> 02:35:22,320
And oh, good news.

3691
02:35:22,560 --> 02:35:26,560
I started work on an original song.

3692
02:35:26,780 --> 02:35:27,240
Yeah.

3693
02:35:29,880 --> 02:35:30,840
I started working on an original song.

3694
02:35:30,840 --> 02:35:32,440
I started work on an original song today.

3695
02:35:33,920 --> 02:35:37,080
So that's like some some good news to look forward.

3696
02:35:37,160 --> 02:35:39,820
I don't know when when when it's going to be.

3697
02:35:39,960 --> 02:35:47,600
But I'm starting work on an original song with a with one of my favorite composers.

3698
02:35:47,740 --> 02:35:49,620
So I'm super looking forward to it.

3699
02:35:52,160 --> 02:35:53,880
Yeah, that's something to look forward to.

3700
02:35:53,960 --> 02:35:54,280
I don't know.

3701
02:35:54,340 --> 02:35:56,640
Look, a lot of these take a lot of time, though.

3702
02:35:56,760 --> 02:35:57,520
Oh my God.

3703
02:35:57,580 --> 02:35:57,760
Wait.

3704
02:35:58,500 --> 02:36:00,040
I really want to like.

3705
02:36:00,840 --> 02:36:04,300
I really want to spoil you guys on something really fucking dumb.

3706
02:36:04,420 --> 02:36:04,900
I'm planning.

3707
02:36:05,220 --> 02:36:06,760
But I can't.

3708
02:36:07,440 --> 02:36:08,800
It's so stupid.

3709
02:36:09,140 --> 02:36:16,080
Yesterday I received something and like yesterday I received something and it was so fucking.

3710
02:36:16,260 --> 02:36:20,820
I commissioned this and it's so fucking dumb.

3711
02:36:21,120 --> 02:36:23,700
I really wish I could show it to you guys.

3712
02:36:23,880 --> 02:36:25,300
But I can't.

3713
02:36:27,080 --> 02:36:29,620
I have to like I'm trying not to.

3714
02:36:29,800 --> 02:36:30,660
But wait.

3715
02:36:30,660 --> 02:36:31,780
One day you'll know.

3716
02:36:31,900 --> 02:36:39,900
One day whenever I finish setting everything up for the really dumb thing I commissioned and like I can finally show you guys.

3717
02:36:39,940 --> 02:36:42,080
You'll know why I was like, it's so dumb.

3718
02:36:45,440 --> 02:36:52,380
You'll know why when I said it was so dumb, but like it was so worth it.

3719
02:36:55,120 --> 02:36:57,640
One day it'll be like a serious special stream.

3720
02:36:57,920 --> 02:36:59,340

02:37:08,760 --> 02:37:10,520

Or like... it could be in like your Super Chat.

So don't worry.

3746

Many!

3750
02:38:47,940 --> 02:38:48,720

Thank you.

3752
02:38:49,320 --> 02:38:51,280
Also, GamerSubs creator code.

3753
02:38:51,380 --> 02:38:52,280
Thank you for the Super Chat.

3754
02:38:52,360 --> 02:38:52,600
Thank you.

3755
02:38:52,640 --> 02:38:53,180
Thank you.

3756
02:38:53,200 --> 02:38:54,080
Oh my god!

3757
02:38:54,200 --> 02:38:58,020
I didn't know being a GamerSubs partner, we get like free...

3758
02:38:58,020 --> 02:38:58,500
Like...

3759
02:38:58,520 --> 02:38:58,620
like...

3760
02:38:58,620 --> 02:39:00,460
Okay, I know we get like free stuff sometimes.

3761
02:39:00,800 --> 02:39:01,500
But like...

3762
02:39:01,500 --> 02:39:03,000
I received an email today.

3763
02:39:03,560 --> 02:39:05,880
That was like, you have made an order.

3764
02:39:05,980 --> 02:39:07,700
To like... GamerSubs.

3765
02:39:07,860 --> 02:39:08,740
And I was like, huh?

3766
02:39:09,160 --> 02:39:09,380
I...

3767
02:39:09,380 --> 02:39:12,460
I was like, what?!

3768
02:39:12,940 --> 02:39:14,580
Obviously I can't read what the order is.

3769
02:39:14,700 --> 02:39:16,120
Because I think they're like flavors.

3770
02:39:16,340 --> 02:39:17,740
In like cups.

3771
02:39:18,060 --> 02:39:19,900
That haven't been released yet.

3772
02:39:20,200 --> 02:39:21,800
Because I was like looking at it.

3773
02:39:21,840 --> 02:39:22,540
I was like, what the...

3774
02:39:22,540 --> 02:39:25,320
I was like, I didn't make an order.

3775
02:39:27,520 --> 02:39:32,080
I was so confused because I was like, I didn't make an order.

3776
02:39:32,420 --> 02:39:33,800
What is this?

3777
02:39:34,320 --> 02:39:37,600
And I looked at it and I was like, wait, what are these flavors?

3778
02:39:38,060 --> 02:39:47,000
I think like when you're a gamer sub partner, they give you like the newest flavors that come out or something.

3779
02:39:47,180 --> 02:39:50,680
Or the newest waifu cups that you like test it out and stuff.

3780
02:39:52,420 --> 02:39:57,880
Obviously, I'm not going to say what the flavor was because I'm pretty sure it's not even out in public.

3781
02:39:58,140 --> 02:40:04,220
I'm pretty sure it's not out in public because I looked at it and I was like, what flavor is this?

3782
02:40:04,260 --> 02:40:07,120
And I like Googled it and it didn't exist.

3783
02:40:07,420 --> 02:40:09,180
I was like, oh, oh shit.

3784
02:40:09,240 --> 02:40:09,480
Okay.

3785
02:40:09,840 --> 02:40:13,000
It's like, yeah, like I'm beta testing it or something.

3786
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:16,220
Because I was like, I didn't order anything.

3787
02:40:16,260 --> 02:40:17,760
What the fuck is this?

3788
02:40:22,940 --> 02:40:24,820
So yeah, I was just like, wait a minute.

3789
02:40:24,940 --> 02:40:26,000
Oh my God, that doesn't even exist.

3790
02:40:26,200 --> 02:40:33,440
I'm pretty sure like when you're a gamer sub partner, they just send you like free samples of like the flavors themselves.

3791
02:40:33,680 --> 02:40:35,120
So you can test it out and stuff.

3792
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:37,980
Well, I haven't received it yet.

3793
02:40:38,020 --> 02:40:38,820
I just literally got it.

3794
02:40:38,980 --> 02:40:40,940
I literally like got the email today.

3795
02:40:43,660 --> 02:40:45,380
Links, thank you for the super chat.

3796
02:40:45,440 --> 02:40:45,680
Thank you.

3797
02:40:45,960 --> 02:40:47,160
Glad I made it in time.

3798
02:40:47,240 --> 02:40:48,740
Saw the total solar eclipse today.

3799
02:40:48,820 --> 02:40:50,000
It was a surreal experience.

3800
02:40:50,260 --> 02:40:50,660
I was sleeping.

3801
02:40:52,980 --> 02:40:53,420
Yay.

3802
02:40:54,240 --> 02:40:58,440
Also like, isn't there like another one in October or August?

3803
02:40:59,200 --> 02:41:02,940
I was like, I saw like people were like, oh my God, the solar eclipse.

3804
02:41:03,160 --> 02:41:04,080
And I was like, solar eclipse.

3805
02:41:04,240 --> 02:41:05,200
And I like looked it up.

3806
02:41:05,300 --> 02:41:08,940
There's another one coming in like August and October.

3807
02:41:09,760 --> 02:41:10,740
There's one every year.

3808
02:41:10,780 --> 02:41:11,640
There's one every year.

3809
02:41:11,940 --> 02:41:13,580
So I was like, wait, what is...

3810
02:41:13,580 --> 02:41:15,000
Oh, in 90 years?

3811
02:41:15,600 --> 02:41:16,340
Wait, what?

3812
02:41:20,550 --> 02:41:22,550
Oh, I was also sleeping.

3813
02:41:22,550 --> 02:41:24,210
It didn't even show up in my area.

3814
02:41:25,270 --> 02:41:27,230
Oh, in 90 years?

3815
02:41:27,690 --> 02:41:31,630
Oh, I was like, wait, I thought eclipse happened every year.

3816
02:41:31,770 --> 02:41:33,610
I was like, what makes this one so special?

3817
02:41:33,790 --> 02:41:34,890
I was so confused.

3818
02:41:36,890 --> 02:41:40,390
Oh, not for another 20 years in NA.

3819
02:41:41,470 --> 02:41:43,070
Oh, I see.

3820
02:41:43,310 --> 02:41:44,210
I see.

3821
02:41:44,370 --> 02:41:46,830
So like people in NA are just...

3822
02:41:46,830 --> 02:41:47,470
We're just...

3823
02:41:47,470 --> 02:41:49,310
We just don't have the privilege.

3824
02:41:49,630 --> 02:41:50,430
I see.

3825
02:41:50,570 --> 02:41:52,450
I guess West Coast just...

3826
02:41:52,450 --> 02:41:53,870
Fuck West Coast, I guess.

3827
02:41:58,310 --> 02:42:00,030
Fuck West Coast, I guess.

3828
02:42:00,130 --> 02:42:00,610
All right.

3829
02:42:00,910 --> 02:42:01,570
All right.

3830
02:42:03,930 --> 02:42:05,250
Kaz, thank you for the super chat.

3831
02:42:05,330 --> 02:42:05,570
Thank you.

3832
02:42:05,610 --> 02:42:06,110
Thank you.

3833
02:42:06,330 --> 02:42:08,290
Fortnite retail therapy is back.

3834
02:42:08,450 --> 02:42:09,590
Hell yeah, it is.

3835
02:42:10,630 --> 02:42:13,670
Many, Foxy and Ginger, thank you for the super chat.

3836
02:42:13,770 --> 02:42:14,050
Thank you.

3837
02:42:14,050 --> 02:42:14,610
Thank you.

3838
02:42:17,150 --> 02:42:17,730
Let's see.

3839
02:42:18,510 --> 02:42:19,730
Joe, thank you for the super chat.

3840
02:42:19,810 --> 02:42:20,050
Thank you.

3841
02:42:20,050 --> 02:42:20,490
Thank you.

3842
02:42:20,490 --> 02:42:22,470
I want to be a petition for the devil to bless Doki bow.

3843
02:42:22,710 --> 02:42:23,570
I don't understand.

3844
02:42:24,110 --> 02:42:28,730
If they can bless the sword, why can't they bless the bow too?

3845
02:42:29,170 --> 02:42:31,690
Like, what you have limited blessing power?

3846
02:42:32,130 --> 02:42:33,470
You're literally God.

3847
02:42:34,390 --> 02:42:38,330
Like, oh I ran out of energy to bless you now.

3848
02:42:40,590 --> 02:42:42,530
Like, what the fuck is that?

3849
02:42:42,890 --> 02:42:45,350
You might as well just fucking bless both.

3850
02:42:45,610 --> 02:42:51,970
If you really wanted me to do your fucking job, God, just fucking give me the power to do the job.

3851
02:42:52,250 --> 02:42:53,550
Like, he gets tired.

3852
02:42:53,670 --> 02:42:56,610
Like, oh, yeah, but he's not tired of backseating me.

3853
02:42:56,910 --> 02:42:57,810
No, no, no!

3854
02:42:58,170 --> 02:42:59,970
God is not tired of that!

3855
02:43:01,450 --> 02:43:01,890
Um...

3856
02:43:05,250 --> 02:43:06,330
Uh... let's see.

3857
02:43:07,610 --> 02:43:08,050
Uh...

3858
02:43:08,570 --> 02:43:09,730
Lolly, thank you for the superchat.

3859
02:43:09,790 --> 02:43:10,610
Thank you, thank you.

3860
02:43:11,070 --> 02:43:14,670
Only a hundred years since toilet paper can be legally advertised.

3861
02:43:14,890 --> 02:43:15,930
That's splinter-free.

3862
02:43:16,010 --> 02:43:16,750
Thank you for the superchat.

3863
02:43:16,830 --> 02:43:17,610
Thank you, thank you.

3864
02:43:17,610 --> 02:43:18,770
Wes, great job.

3865
02:43:18,870 --> 02:43:20,470
Professional stress oil therapist.

3866
02:43:20,770 --> 02:43:21,530
Thank you for the superchat.

3867
02:43:21,610 --> 02:43:22,470
Thank you, thank you.

3868
02:43:23,710 --> 02:43:24,110
Um...

3869
02:43:24,110 --> 02:43:24,610
Chi!

3870
02:43:25,390 --> 02:43:30,810
Speaking of solar power, did you ever play that old Nintendo Game Boy game that required to physically be under the sun?

3871
02:43:30,930 --> 02:43:31,210
IRL.

3872
02:43:31,290 --> 02:43:32,330
Thank you for the superchat, Chi.

3873
02:43:32,430 --> 02:43:33,090
Thank you, thank you.

3874
02:43:33,250 --> 02:43:36,530
No, most of the Game Boy games I played were, like, Pokemon.

3875
02:43:37,290 --> 02:43:41,370
And I remember I played the Pokemon one, the Dragon Ball Z game.

3876
02:43:42,110 --> 02:43:45,650
Where, um, it was like an RPG-esque one.

3877
02:43:46,210 --> 02:43:47,010
And then...

3878
02:43:47,010 --> 02:43:47,530
I railed!

3879
02:43:47,610 --> 02:43:49,010
But, like, actually a lot of the Pokemon...

3880
02:43:49,010 --> 02:43:52,950
Like, a lot of the Game Boy games I had were, um...

3881
02:43:52,950 --> 02:43:54,130
I'm trying to remember.

3882
02:43:54,450 --> 02:43:58,630
I literally only remember the most of the games I remember, which is Pokemon.

3883
02:43:59,930 --> 02:44:06,030
But like, you know, like when you're like, I don't know if this is like, an Asian kid thing or, like, any kid thing.

3884
02:44:06,250 --> 02:44:09,430
But, like, my mom would buy me these little, like, boxes.

3885
02:44:09,450 --> 02:44:12,550
And I just chuck my game cartridges in there.

3886
02:44:13,490 --> 02:44:15,030
Like, I just have these little...

3887
02:44:15,030 --> 02:44:16,930
I think they're, like, Ikea boxes.

3888
02:44:16,930 --> 02:44:18,270
This is the second one.

3889
02:44:49,830 --> 02:44:54,630
I didn't play that fucking Dragon Ball Z game for so fucking long.

3890
02:44:55,370 --> 02:44:58,270
So it's like embedded into my memory.

3891
02:44:58,450 --> 02:45:02,630
Any RPG, the RPG one, it was like semi-RPG I remember.

3892
02:45:08,780 --> 02:45:11,160
I don't know, I need to like look it up.

3893
02:45:11,280 --> 02:45:14,420
I can't remember on top of my head what it was.

3894
02:45:14,420 --> 02:45:23,600
But I found out that like a lot of the Game Boy games, like a lot of the Game Boy games, like Game Boy Advance or whatever, or just normal Game Boy.

3895
02:45:23,780 --> 02:45:27,800
Like the cartridges, like it has a battery in there and it can expire.

3896
02:45:28,200 --> 02:45:29,320
I didn't realize that.

3897
02:45:29,480 --> 02:45:31,600
I thought like, you know, it's like a CD.

3898
02:45:31,740 --> 02:45:35,600
It never dies, except like, I don't know, if it's like super scratched up or stuff.

3899
02:45:35,820 --> 02:45:40,000
But I didn't realize like a lot of them have like a little battery built in.

3900
02:45:40,140 --> 02:45:44,060
So like a lot of the old games are like the same.

3901
02:45:44,060 --> 02:45:44,960
Yeah, for the save file.

3902
02:45:45,160 --> 02:45:52,480
Like a lot of the old games and stuff, they don't really work anymore because there's no... the battery just dies.

3903
02:45:55,160 --> 02:45:56,900
The save games and stuff.

3904
02:45:57,000 --> 02:45:57,960
Yeah, it can die down.

3905
02:45:59,700 --> 02:46:00,860
So they expire.

3906
02:46:01,020 --> 02:46:02,060
Yeah, I didn't realize that.

3907
02:46:02,160 --> 02:46:05,820
So you might lose your save soon in a couple of years.

3908
02:46:07,200 --> 02:46:08,460
Or replace the battery.

3909
02:46:08,520 --> 02:46:09,280
They can recharge.

3910
02:46:09,380 --> 02:46:11,820
Oh, or you have to replace them and recharge it.

3911
02:46:12,460 --> 02:46:13,780
I thought it was super interesting.

3912
02:46:15,140 --> 02:46:18,300
That like, I didn't realize there were like batteries inside the cartridges.

3913
02:46:22,860 --> 02:46:23,540
Let's see.

3914
02:46:24,260 --> 02:46:25,100
Where was I?

3915
02:46:28,880 --> 02:46:30,500
Attack Arcade Boomer Ginger.

3916
02:46:30,680 --> 02:46:31,500
Thank you for the super chat.

3917
02:46:31,640 --> 02:46:31,940
Thank you.

3918
02:46:31,940 --> 02:46:32,560
Thank you.

3919
02:46:32,840 --> 02:46:33,200
Sleep.

3920
02:46:33,940 --> 02:46:34,660
Holly fuck.

3921
02:46:34,820 --> 02:46:36,560
Oh, yeah, this one guy was like, holy fuck.

3922
02:46:36,600 --> 02:46:37,280
I left out my meeting.

3923
02:46:37,320 --> 02:46:37,860
Are we still looking?

3924
02:46:37,880 --> 02:46:39,500
That was when I had the Great Lake Adventure.

3925
02:46:44,060 --> 02:46:46,580
The Great fucking Lake Adventure.

3926
02:46:50,560 --> 02:46:52,020
We made it though.

3927
02:46:52,240 --> 02:46:54,300
We fucking made it.

3928
02:46:56,280 --> 02:46:59,720
It was like a one super chat that I really wanted to read that I missed out.

3929
02:47:00,040 --> 02:47:01,680
I can't... God, where is it?

3930
02:47:02,220 --> 02:47:03,100
Where is it?

3931
02:47:03,920 --> 02:47:07,100
It was this one super chat I really, really wanted to read, but I can't.

3932
02:47:07,120 --> 02:47:07,960
It was a long one.

3933
02:47:08,120 --> 02:47:09,540
I can't find it anymore.

3934
02:47:09,700 --> 02:47:13,140
I saw it, but it went by so fast because I forgot to pull up the super...

3935
02:47:13,780 --> 02:47:16,380
like only super chat chat that I missed out.

3936
02:47:16,820 --> 02:47:17,880
Where is it?

3937
02:47:18,040 --> 02:47:19,340
Where the fuck is...

3938
02:47:20,740 --> 02:47:22,700
Does anyone remember the guy's name?

3939
02:47:23,140 --> 02:47:25,340
He said he had to do like go somewhere.

3940
02:47:25,820 --> 02:47:26,880
What was that guy's name?

3941
02:47:27,600 --> 02:47:28,800
What color was it?

3942
02:47:29,280 --> 02:47:30,360
I don't remember.

3943
02:47:31,380 --> 02:47:35,080
Because I remember everybody was like... was like saying something about it.

3944
02:47:36,580 --> 02:47:38,140
No, I don't know.

3945
02:47:38,260 --> 02:47:40,400
Guys, your memory is just as bad as mine.

3946
02:47:40,700 --> 02:47:41,560
Was it Def... yeah!

3947
02:47:42,060 --> 02:47:42,580
Defwisher!

3948
02:47:43,120 --> 02:47:43,820
That's the guy!

3949
02:47:43,940 --> 02:47:46,160
So everybody was like... like Defwisher.

3950
02:47:46,320 --> 02:47:47,380
And I was like, what the fuck?

3951
02:47:47,400 --> 02:47:48,960
Who's Def are you wishing for?

3952
02:47:49,240 --> 02:47:51,300
Like I was so confused.

3953
02:47:51,960 --> 02:47:55,700
I was like... because I saw the super chat like so fast.

3954
02:47:55,760 --> 02:47:59,460
I didn't see the name and then everybody was like wishing Def for something.

3955
02:47:59,660 --> 02:48:01,860
And I was like, bro, what the fuck happened in my chat?

3956
02:48:02,320 --> 02:48:05,740
Who the fucking... who's Def do you guys want to wish for?

3957
02:48:06,020 --> 02:48:07,100
I was so confused.

3958
02:48:07,320 --> 02:48:08,080
Oh, there you go.

3959
02:48:09,640 --> 02:48:10,480
Hey Doki.

3960
02:48:10,600 --> 02:48:12,340
I love watching your streams and admire you.

3961
02:48:12,340 --> 02:48:15,100
Thank you for pushing forward even when it is incredibly tough.

3962
02:48:15,320 --> 02:48:19,640
Couldn't do any of my maps to join the Air Force and just finished my ASVAB.

3963
02:48:19,820 --> 02:48:21,140
What the fuck is ASVAB?

3964
02:48:21,420 --> 02:48:22,420
Wish me luck.

3965
02:48:22,500 --> 02:48:23,580
Thank you for the super chat.

3966
02:48:23,680 --> 02:48:23,960
Thank you.

3967
02:48:24,340 --> 02:48:25,320
What the fuck is that?

3968
02:48:25,480 --> 02:48:28,660
The Armed Service Vocational Aptitude Battery.

3969
02:48:29,560 --> 02:48:30,920
Do you make that... what is that?

3970
02:48:31,080 --> 02:48:32,460
What is that apt for?

3971
02:48:33,440 --> 02:48:38,440
Develop abilities and help predict future academic and occupational success in the military.

3972
02:48:38,940 --> 02:48:39,060
Oh!

3973
02:48:40,300 --> 02:48:41,960
The fucking Air Force.

3974
02:48:42,340 --> 02:48:43,760
You have to have like...

3975
02:48:44,240 --> 02:48:45,660
You have to be able to like...

3976
02:48:45,660 --> 02:48:47,060
Like take in like... what is it?

3977
02:48:47,140 --> 02:48:48,460
The high pressure rates.

3978
02:48:48,480 --> 02:48:50,520
Like when you're flying the plane really high.

3979
02:48:50,760 --> 02:48:52,260
You like don't pass out and stuff.

3980
02:48:52,520 --> 02:48:53,800
Oh, it's an IQ test?

3981
02:48:54,020 --> 02:48:54,580
What's your IQ?

3982
02:48:54,860 --> 02:48:55,200
Hahaha.

3983
02:48:56,520 --> 02:48:57,300
What's your IQ?

3984
02:48:57,800 --> 02:48:58,200
Hahaha.

3985
02:48:59,720 --> 02:49:00,120
Hahaha.

3986
02:49:00,280 --> 02:49:03,100
Oh, so you're smart enough to be in the Air Force.

3987
02:49:04,680 --> 02:49:06,160
Can you... is that good?

3988
02:49:08,740 --> 02:49:09,420
I don't know.

3989
02:49:09,460 --> 02:49:09,800
I don't know.

3990
02:49:09,860 --> 02:49:11,300
I don't know how smart you have to be in the Air Force.

3991
02:49:11,300 --> 02:49:12,760
I guess you need to know physics, right?

3992
02:49:13,520 --> 02:49:14,000
Hahaha.

3993
02:49:17,240 --> 02:49:19,900
Not all of the Air Force fly planes though.

3994
02:49:19,980 --> 02:49:21,840
Then why they call the Air Force?

3995
02:49:23,320 --> 02:49:24,680
Like... what's the point?

3996
02:49:25,320 --> 02:49:25,800
Hahaha.

3997
02:49:27,180 --> 02:49:27,880
Then what?

3998
02:49:27,980 --> 02:49:28,580
Ground Force?

3999
02:49:28,820 --> 02:49:30,500
You might as well be the fucking Land Force.

4000
02:49:30,680 --> 02:49:31,820
If you're not all of them are gonna fly.

4001
02:49:33,240 --> 02:49:34,420
Yes, I don't know.

4002
02:49:35,080 --> 02:49:38,760
I don't know if the Air Force requires you to be smart.

4003
02:49:38,980 --> 02:49:40,200
I don't know.

4004
02:49:41,400 --> 02:49:41,840
Hahaha.

4005
02:49:43,760 --> 02:49:44,200
Hahaha.

4006
02:49:45,820 --> 02:49:48,840
I... how is that... I'm not in the military.

4007
02:49:49,380 --> 02:49:51,440
Why would I know this information?

4008
02:49:52,580 --> 02:49:53,020
Like...

4009
02:49:53,020 --> 02:49:53,740
Hahaha.

4010
02:49:55,260 --> 02:50:00,140
I like how you guys assume I know how smart you have to be in the Air Force.

4011
02:50:00,280 --> 02:50:02,300
And this is the American Air Force.

4012
02:50:02,700 --> 02:50:03,520
I assume.

4013
02:50:03,960 --> 02:50:05,240
Yeah, it's in the USD.

4014
02:50:05,760 --> 02:50:07,340
Like, I'm not American.

4015
02:50:07,400 --> 02:50:10,100
How am I supposed to know how smart you have to be in America?

4016
02:50:10,100 --> 02:50:10,440
In America!

4017
02:50:10,720 --> 02:50:12,540
In American Air Force!

4018
02:50:13,480 --> 02:50:15,880
I barely know how smart you have to be in the Canadian...

4019
02:50:15,880 --> 02:50:16,780
Do we have an army?

4020
02:50:17,020 --> 02:50:19,620
Or like, hypothetical Canadian army?

4021
02:50:20,220 --> 02:50:20,620
Hahaha.

4022
02:50:21,240 --> 02:50:23,440
Where the majority of us are just the Mounties?

4023
02:50:23,780 --> 02:50:24,180
Hahaha.

4024
02:50:25,780 --> 02:50:26,180
Hahaha.

4025
02:50:29,320 --> 02:50:30,620
Maddie, thank you for the super chat.

4026
02:50:30,700 --> 02:50:31,480
Thank you, thank you.

4027
02:50:31,660 --> 02:50:33,660
Good luck, Deafwisher, if you're still here.

4028
02:50:33,800 --> 02:50:35,160
You'll have a lot of fun.

4029
02:50:35,220 --> 02:50:36,960
I wish I joined the Air Force instead.

4030
02:50:37,620 --> 02:50:39,060
Motherfucker, thank you for the super chat.

4031
02:50:39,060 --> 02:50:39,720
Thank you, thank you.

4032
02:50:39,800 --> 02:50:41,240
Maddie, you have to be smart for that.

4033
02:50:41,860 --> 02:50:42,260
Hahaha.

4034
02:50:42,960 --> 02:50:43,060
Hahaha.

4035
02:50:45,380 --> 02:50:46,260
Oh my god.

4036
02:50:46,360 --> 02:50:47,400
I think the f- Okay.

4037
02:50:47,600 --> 02:50:48,140
I don't know.

4038
02:50:48,280 --> 02:50:48,560
Okay.

4039
02:50:48,640 --> 02:50:49,120
I don't know.

4040
02:50:49,140 --> 02:50:51,520
This might be a little like, whoa, Doki!

4041
02:50:51,820 --> 02:50:58,520
But like, I think it's funny that the army in America has started to recruit in anime conventions.

4042
02:50:59,120 --> 02:50:59,920
I don't know.

4043
02:50:59,980 --> 02:51:07,080
And then they get like cosplay- Like, they hire like professional cosplayers to stand next to their booth to like, uh...

4044
02:51:07,500 --> 02:51:08,160
Like, you know.

4045
02:51:08,160 --> 02:51:10,080
To stand next to their booth to recruit.

4046
02:51:10,280 --> 02:51:10,660
I don't know.

4047
02:51:10,660 --> 02:51:12,000
I just find that fucking hilarious.

4048
02:51:12,480 --> 02:51:15,000
Like, they're trying to recruit like, we...

4049
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:18,220
Like, they're trying to recruit weeds to the army now.

4050
02:51:18,400 --> 02:51:20,400
And I find that so fucking funny.

4051
02:51:22,080 --> 02:51:23,180
You guys know that?

4052
02:51:23,260 --> 02:51:23,440
Yeah!

4053
02:51:24,420 --> 02:51:24,940
Yeah!

4054
02:51:25,220 --> 02:51:25,680
They do.

4055
02:51:25,760 --> 02:51:26,740
That's the thing for...

4056
02:51:26,740 --> 02:51:27,420
I didn't realize.

4057
02:51:27,560 --> 02:51:29,960
No, but like, I didn't notice that until...

4058
02:51:29,960 --> 02:51:30,900
Um...

4059
02:51:31,680 --> 02:51:34,940
Until they started hiring professional cosplayers.

4060
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:37,000
To like, man the booths.

4061
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:39,900
Like, really like, beautiful anime girls.

4062
02:51:40,180 --> 02:51:41,980
Like, standing next to the booth.

4063
02:51:42,160 --> 02:51:44,960
So like, to like, try and sign up some like...

4064
02:51:44,960 --> 02:51:47,680
Some like, I don't know, some weaves to join the army.

4065
02:51:47,780 --> 02:51:49,340
And I thought it was like, pretty funny.

4066
02:51:50,640 --> 02:51:54,500
Did you know like, the US army has a Twitch channel too?

4067
02:51:55,000 --> 02:51:56,140
Like, they're so...

4068
02:51:56,140 --> 02:51:57,640
They're like, they're targeting everybody.

4069
02:51:57,980 --> 02:51:59,280
They're also targeting gamers.

4070
02:51:59,620 --> 02:52:01,180
Gamers are also not safe.

4071
02:52:01,380 --> 02:52:03,300
Gamers like, Twitch has an...

4072
02:52:03,300 --> 02:52:06,580
Like, they have an official partner Twitch channel.

4073
02:52:06,580 --> 02:52:09,480
And where they host like, tournaments and stuff.

4074
02:52:09,720 --> 02:52:11,900
And like, they like, stream...

4075
02:52:11,900 --> 02:52:14,320
Like, stream on Twitch.

4076
02:52:14,400 --> 02:52:15,160
Like, the arm...

4077
02:52:15,160 --> 02:52:17,900
Like, the soldiers in the US army.

4078
02:52:18,140 --> 02:52:19,500
Like, the members in the US army.

4079
02:52:19,620 --> 02:52:21,220
They actually do like, Twitch streams.

4080
02:52:21,400 --> 02:52:23,660
And try to host like, tournaments.

4081
02:52:23,880 --> 02:52:25,820
Cause they once hosted Overwatch tournament.

4082
02:52:26,080 --> 02:52:31,620
I remember back then, the US army sponsored an Overwatch tournament.

4083
02:52:31,780 --> 02:52:33,880
Like, an Overwatch Invitational.

4084
02:52:33,960 --> 02:52:35,640
And I remembered it.

4085
02:52:35,640 --> 02:52:37,200
Because like, one of my...

4086
02:52:37,200 --> 02:52:39,540
Like, one of the teams I was in was like, Oh my god, we should...

4087
02:52:39,540 --> 02:52:43,880
We should like, you know, sign up for the US Army Invitational.

4088
02:52:50,020 --> 02:52:51,780
Yeah, they have official teams.

4089
02:52:52,160 --> 02:52:55,640
They have actual official like, FPS teams too.

4090
02:52:56,080 --> 02:52:57,300
It is actually...

4091
02:52:57,300 --> 02:52:58,120
It is crazy.

4092
02:52:59,520 --> 02:53:00,840
They have a Liquipedia.

4093
02:53:01,020 --> 02:53:05,400
They sponsor like, actual like, teams in esports.

4094
02:53:06,520 --> 02:53:07,740
Spirit, thank you for the superchat.

4095
02:53:07,800 --> 02:53:08,400
Thank you, thank you.

4096
02:53:08,460 --> 02:53:11,620
As someone who is in the Royal Canadian Navy, I can say we do have an army.

4097
02:53:11,780 --> 02:53:15,440
One good thing about our military is that we have better training than most other...

4098
02:53:16,160 --> 02:53:16,520
...militaries.

4099
02:53:16,600 --> 02:53:17,320
Or so they say.

4100
02:53:17,580 --> 02:53:18,700
Thank you for the superchat.

4101
02:53:19,280 --> 02:53:20,520
Thank you, thank you.

4102
02:53:20,880 --> 02:53:21,560
Name them.

4103
02:53:21,760 --> 02:53:22,540
Better than who?

4104
02:53:23,920 --> 02:53:24,800
Call them out.

4105
02:53:27,180 --> 02:53:28,500
Thank you for the superchat.

4106
02:53:28,600 --> 02:53:29,540
Thank you, thank you.

4107
02:53:32,300 --> 02:53:32,660
Umm...

4108
02:53:33,120 --> 02:53:33,480
Umm...

4109
02:53:33,920 --> 02:53:34,280
Anyway.

4110
02:53:34,280 --> 02:53:35,980
I am gonna call it here, everybody.

4111
02:53:36,300 --> 02:53:38,940
I know this was a super short superchat reading.

4112
02:53:39,220 --> 02:53:42,760
But then I got like, a message of some work stuff I have to do.

4113
02:53:42,940 --> 02:53:44,800
So I have to call it here, guys.

4114
02:53:45,080 --> 02:53:45,900
I had a little fun.

4115
02:53:45,960 --> 02:53:47,080
Zach is done with all of you guys.

4116
02:53:47,120 --> 02:53:49,920
I hope like, when things started stabilizing...

4117
02:53:49,920 --> 02:53:52,660
...we can have longer superchat talks again.

4118
02:53:53,200 --> 02:53:54,240
After the stream.

4119
02:53:54,520 --> 02:53:54,960
So...

4120
02:53:55,760 --> 02:53:56,200
So...

4121
02:53:56,200 --> 02:53:59,460
I will try my best to stabilize as fast as...

4122
02:53:59,460 --> 02:54:00,540
Like, not as fast, but like...

4123
02:54:00,540 --> 02:54:02,560
I will try my best to one day be stabilized.

4124
02:54:02,620 --> 02:54:03,060
So...

4125
02:54:03,060 --> 02:54:06,240
I don't have to worry about work stuff after stream.

4126
02:54:07,420 --> 02:54:07,860
Umm...

4127
02:54:07,860 --> 02:54:09,180
I guess...

4128
02:54:10,300 --> 02:54:12,020
We are slowly getting back into it, though.

4129
02:54:12,180 --> 02:54:15,040
We are slowly getting back to having like, regular superchat talks.

4130
02:54:15,660 --> 02:54:17,040
Superchat readings after streams.

4131
02:54:17,340 --> 02:54:18,560
Just takes a little bit.

4132
02:54:18,800 --> 02:54:19,540
Slow and steady.

4133
02:54:20,640 --> 02:54:21,740
As always, everybody.

4134
02:54:23,440 --> 02:54:24,300
Stay hydrated.

4135
02:54:24,960 --> 02:54:25,580
Posture check.

4136
02:54:25,720 --> 02:54:27,620
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

4137
02:54:27,720 --> 02:54:29,200
And if you stayed up for me...

4138
02:54:29,200 --> 02:54:29,840
Head to bed.

4139
02:54:29,960 --> 02:54:30,860
Because you deserve it.

4140
02:54:30,920 --> 02:54:31,960
I will see you guys next time, everybody.

4141
02:54:31,960 --> 02:54:33,080
Bye, guys!

4142
02:54:33,400 --> 02:54:33,980
Bye!

4143
02:54:34,740 --> 02:54:36,060
3 2
