1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,080
Hello everybody!

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:03,500
Hello!

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,760
Oh my god, I'm here.

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,640
I'm tired, but I'm here.

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,680
I need to check down some gamer subs, by the way.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,080
Before this, before this matter.

7
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:32,240
As you guys know, the schedule is really messed up at the moment because I had that 3.30am tournament and I took that 2 hour nap and then I had the meet and greet and then I walked out and now I'm here.

8
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,620
What a day.

9
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,420
What a freaking day.

10
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,600
But I'm happy to be here!

11
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:43,760
I'm always happy to meet my dragoons here all the way from Florida.

12
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,320
That's where I can go.

13
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,600
Never been to Florida.

14
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,260
All I know about Florida is that it's America's dick.

15
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,540
That's really all I know.

16
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,320
And you guys have alligators.

17
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,020
And there's Florida man.

18
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,360
That's all I know about Florida.

19
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,040
But I'm so happy to be here.

20
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,720
I believe this is a Q&A.

21
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,560
I am so professional.

22
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,980
I was like, I think it's a Q&A.

23
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,720
But yeah, for those who don't know who I am, my name is Doki Bade.

24
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,060
I am a Vtuber.

25
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,600
I guess that's it.

26
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,280
I don't know what else to say.

27
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,060
I do not belong to any company.

28
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,780
I'm just an independent Vtuber.

29
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:32,680
Obviously I like to play.

30
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,380
I have a crippling addiction to Marble Rivals.

31
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:36,820
And I know that's a problem.

32
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,760
Right after this panel, I'm going to play Marble Rivals.

33
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,780
That's where I'm at right now.

34
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,820
Wish I was sponsored by Marble Rivals to show that game.

35
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,560
But I'm not.

36
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,300
I just have a very, very unhealthy addiction right now.

37
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,700
Anyway, I think that's really it.

38
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,620
I like to play shooters.

39
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,240
I was going to say FPS games.

40
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,060
But I was like, no.

41
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,060
Marble Rivals is third person.

42
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:11,260
I like to play games that go pew pew.

43
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,200
And oh my gosh, that's really it.

44
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,240
I laugh way too much.

45
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,240
But at that point, I feel like a lot of you guys are already like Stockholm Syndrome to my laugh.

46
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,060
That's basically like breathing now.

47
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,940
If she stops laughing, she'll die type deal.

48
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:35,880
Anyway, I don't really know how the Q&A portion is supposed to work.

49
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,380
So I assume like...

50
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,900
I don't know where the guy is with the microphone.

51
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,220
Where's the microphone?

52
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,820
Oh, there it is.

53
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,540
I see it.

54
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,560
I see the microphone.

55
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,220
There's the guy waving the mic.

56
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:56,420
So basically, I guess you raise your hand if you want to ask me a question.

57
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,920
And then like the microphone guy is going to come over and give you the mic.

58
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,260
And then I guess I answer your question.

59
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,240
That's basically it.

60
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,560
A lot of these panels are ready.

61
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,060
It's like second nature.

62
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,620
I'm hosting myself.

63
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,140
I'm my own MC too for my own panel.

64
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,500
So like I hope everything goes well.

65
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,940
I assume the guy with the microphone is going to screen the questions for me.

66
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,260
So nothing... so you know.

67
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:32,600
Yeah, things won't go like weird and awkward in the middle of this Q&A.

68
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:39,220
So I guess if you want to ask me a question, just raise your hand like you're in class.

69
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,860
And I'll be like you there.

70
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,880
You get the Q&A question.

71
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,680
Alright, who wants to ask me a question?

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,640
Nope.

73
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,700
Oh, okay.

74
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:50,860
No, everyone.

75
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,360
Wow.

76
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,180
Hi Doki.

77
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:00,000
I was wondering if maybe you have any tips for Marvel rivals.

78
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,620
Thank you for feeding my addiction.

79
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:04,260
Okay.

80
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,080
Well, okay.

81
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,360
So like this is something I learned yesterday.

82
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:12,200
So like yesterday I learned this out.

83
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:18,740
But when you get to Diamond, you can ban characters that other people pick.

84
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,620
So don't ban somebody's one trick because people get very mad.

85
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:30,140
And it's not... you know you think everything will be majority vote.

86
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,260
Because you know, literally five people banned Psylocke.

87
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,100
And then we had a Groot one trick.

88
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,280
And I was like wouldn't it be fun...

89
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,620
And we were all like laughing at that Groot one trick.

90
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,780
And we were like, wow, you can't play any other character wearing Grandmaster.

91
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,220
And then I was like, you guys, you know what's funny?

92
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,700
What if I vote for Groot to ban Groot?

93
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,160
And then I was literally the one person that voted Groot.

94
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:02,060
Apparently it's not majority vote for some fucking reason.

95
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,420
And it flipped to Groot.

96
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:10,620
Literally it was five Psylocke, one Groot, and it chose Groot.

97
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,680
And we had a Groot one trick.

98
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,860
We had two Groot one tricks actually.

99
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,280
That's the one thing I didn't say on the tweet.

100
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,560
We actually had two Groot one tricks.

101
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,240
So we were messed up at the beginning anyway.

102
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,300
And then my entire team was like, how dare you do that?

103
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,640
I was like, how was I supposed to know it was gonna flip?

104
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,420
Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm ranting right now.

105
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,520
I needed to let this out.

106
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:41,900
Anyway, don't ban people's one tricks because realize that it is not majority vote.

107
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,680
And banning a character is based off of random chance.

108
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,920
It doesn't matter who you vote for.

109
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,260
Voting doesn't matter in Marvel Rivals.

110
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,280
It's all random.

111
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,600
Anyway, another tip is that...

112
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,580
Another tip, I guess I play support.

113
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,020
I don't play DPS or tank.

114
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,680
Don't pee a one trick.

115
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,800
That's my other tip.

116
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,200
Don't pee a freaking one trick.

117
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,500
Because they will target you.

118
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,180
Anyway, I guess for support, just heal.

119
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,600
Who cares about the DPS?

120
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,400
Just heal the tanks.

121
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,640
No one cares about them.

122
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:22,380
They can yell at you all they want, but they're useless.

123
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:27,020
The tanks are what carries the game if you're a support player.

124
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,320
Anyway, that's my tip of the day.

125
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:34,300
Another helpful tip for Marvel Rivals is to not play Marvel Rivals.

126
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,580
Because it is... oh my gosh, I'm a mess.

127
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,000
It's a very unhealthy addiction.

128
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:45,280
I told this story before on stream.

129
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:50,260
Basically, I did a 15 hour session of Marvel Rivals.

130
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:55,440
And then after I was done, I had to go to the passport office to renew my passport.

131
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,860
Because it literally expired the next day.

132
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,060
And I didn't take a picture of it yet.

133
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,420
So then I went to a place to take a photo of your passport.

134
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,860
And I chose the 10 year option too.

135
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:09,340
Because I didn't want to do this again in 5 years.

136
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,520
I was like, 5 to 10 years.

137
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,740
I don't want to handle responsibility in 5 years.

138
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,860
I'd rather just wait 10 years.

139
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:20,260
So basically, I just went and took the picture post-ranking session.

140
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,480
The Marvel Rivals picture.

141
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:26,300
And they were like, is this the photo that you want to represent you for the next 10 years?

142
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,480
And I looked dead inside.

143
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:34,060
And in my head, I was like, yeah, that's the photo I want to represent me for 10 years.

144
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:43,340
So if you haven't tried Marvel Rivals yet, do not try Marvel Rivals.

145
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,560
Because it's not healthy for you.

146
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,240
It's not good for you.

147
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,640
It's a great game, but it's not healthy.

148
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:58,140
Alright, next question.

149
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,850
Who's the guy that's asking me the next question?

150
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:09,990
Alright, it's time to divide people.

151
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,570
Pizza or pasta?

152
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:13,630
Okay.

153
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:17,130
Oh, no, pasta.

154
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:18,710
100% pasta.

155
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:24,810
Pasta, there's so many different types of pasta you can get.

156
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:33,590
There's mac and cheese, there's linguine, there's fettuccine, there's penne, there's the others.

157
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:38,110
There's rigatoni, there's oh my god, there's so many pasta.

158
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,010
Pizza is just pizza.

159
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,710
It's just pizza.

160
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:49,470
To be fair, my favorite pizza currently is the hot honey pepperoni pizza.

161
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:50,430
That shit's fire.

162
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,930
If you've never tried it, it's actually so good.

163
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:57,770
But if you're really bad with spice, I guess it sucks to be you.

164
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,370
I'm sorry.

165
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,010
You're missing out.

166
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,350
100% pasta.

167
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:09,190
Alright, next question.

168
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:11,070
How does that divide people?

169
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:11,830
I don't understand.

170
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,270
It's like pizza and pasta.

171
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:14,790
They're both good types of food.

172
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:23,230
Hi, my question is, if you could cosplay any character, who would you want to cosplay?

173
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:24,490
Myself.

174
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:32,650
I love you so, I'm honestly, yeah, myself.

175
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:44,150
Oh my gosh, people who cosplay as me, in any form, like my current skin suit, shout out to you guys.

176
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:50,010
Especially during the summer, because I found out recently that leather jackets are incredibly hot.

177
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:58,410
So, shout out to you guys that are willing to wear a leather jacket during the summer, because that shit's hot.

178
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,150
But yeah, that's my answer.

179
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,530
Oh my gosh, it's like we're speed running.

180
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,430
It's just like that 30 second meet and greet again.

181
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:10,970
I'm sorry, I'm in that meet and greet mood right now, where it was like 30 seconds.

182
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:16,690
So like, I was like, it sucks to, like, okay, so like, I didn't realize it was 30 seconds.

183
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:24,550
I'm sorry to the first person I talked to during that meet and greet, because I didn't realize it was 30 seconds.

184
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:28,250
So I literally took up 20 seconds of just talking to them.

185
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,270
And then they're like, 10 seconds left.

186
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,790
I'm like, oh, I'm sorry, you didn't say anything.

187
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,610
Alright, next question.

188
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:43,570
Hi Doki, do you have any plans to do any more 3D?

189
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,790
Maybe like in your own setting instead of like a concert?

190
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:49,330
Oh, yes, 100%.

191
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,190
I have.

192
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:52,930
I've not prepped anything for it.

193
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:55,490
A lot of people think I did, but I have not.

194
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:58,950
I just got the model and everything.

195
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:01,850
But 100% yes.

196
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:06,430
I'm not currently, I know like Min has used her like 3D for the fireworks thing.

197
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:12,150
But like, I have no plans on using it, using the model yet for like home 3D stuff.

198
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:20,630
Because I want to like have an official debut debut for the model before I do like, before I use it in stream and stuff.

199
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:30,250
But like, the hardest part is just like, trying to, I guess like, I could use the studio where we did the, the concert.

200
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:36,930
But like, I do I want like, I'm like, because like, I'm thinking like, Oh, which studio should I get to do it?

201
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:40,630
Because I have like huge plans I want to do for my 3D debut.

202
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:46,570
And like, I want to like commission a bunch of like stages and stuff like that and have games and stuff.

203
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:51,130
And invite people to debut and everything.

204
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:55,310
So like, definitely not in the near future, near near future.

205
00:11:55,470 --> 00:12:00,670
Maybe like, I don't know if you guys know this, but 3D is a lot of plans.

206
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,910
So it's a lot of work.

207
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:07,630
So like, I definitely want to do it, but it's not in the near future right now.

208
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:14,770
Because I have not even contacted any studios on like, you know, the filming wise of a 3D debut.

209
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:17,810
So yeah, we'll see how it goes.

210
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:18,890
We'll see how it goes.

211
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,990
I have like a million things happening right now.

212
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:27,070
I'm surprised like, I'm, I'm surprised I can, I can even function at the moment.

213
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,090
Yeah, that's my answer.

214
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,560
Hi Toki.

215
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,080
Hey.

216
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,080
I have a question.

217
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,160
Would you eat a hard boiled ragu egg?

218
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:51,740
Okay, but like, is there a dragoon inside that egg?

219
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,280
That's like, I mean, there's extra protein to be fair.

220
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:59,380
But, oh my god, it's literally just chicken.

221
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,620
Like, it's not, you're like, what?

222
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,060
That's, that's messed.

223
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:07,040
Sometimes I don't know if I'm allowed to swear because I'm pretty sure there's like kids walking around.

224
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:10,420
So, so I'm like, okay, thank you.

225
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:16,720
Like, maybe they're not sitting in the audience, but I'm pretty sure there's children walking around with their parents right now.

226
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,600
And I'm like being blasted out into the stage.

227
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,660
So I'm trying to make sure not to swear at the moment.

228
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,140
I'm sorry to the random kids that are parents, kids and family that's walking around.

229
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,240
I'm really sorry.

230
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,740
But I'm like thinking like, I mean, it's like, it's literally chicken.

231
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:39,640
So it's not that messed up to eat like a hard boiled egg.

232
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,720
I mean, we eat regular chicken eggs.

233
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,000
So like, what's that?

234
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,720
What's wrong with eating a dragoon egg when it's literally just chicken?

235
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:56,140
So yes, I would like it's not cannibalism because I'm not, I don't share the same biology as you.

236
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,420
I'm literally at the top of the food chain and you're at the bottom.

237
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,720
Next question.

238
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:07,620
Hello.

239
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,340
So I have a question.

240
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:17,220
If you could eliminate one entire video game franchise, like just completely erase it, what would it be?

241
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:17,820
League.

242
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,140
It's where toxicity began.

243
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,040
100% League of Legends.

244
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,060
I don't care what you guys say.

245
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,660
No, fuck MOBAs.

246
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,540
And you're like, no, not League.

247
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,920
You only like League because of Arcane.

248
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:55,700
I am, I, I've never, I played League one time, like 10 plus years ago.

249
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,800
And that was enough League to last me for eternity until I die.

250
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:09,040
So honestly, like, I don't even need to explain myself why I would eliminate League of Legends.

251
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:24,380
Like, I feel like it, like, if a video game that relies on team play removes one of the most crucial elements of team play, which is voice chat, then you know something is wrong.

252
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:34,840
If you can't even communicate with people in voice on a team game in ranked, something is fricking wrong.

253
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:34,920
Alright,

254
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:40,450
next question.

255
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:46,550
So Doki, remember the last song of the concert?

256
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:49,070
And how apparently it's supposed to be in front of the thing?

257
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:49,570
Oh, don't you shake it?

258
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:52,590
No, the one with the S word in it.

259
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:56,070
Oh, you mean, oh, you can't say it because there's children around.

260
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:56,830
Yes, yes, yes.

261
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:04,150
So, I, we talked to Mint yesterday, and apparently everyone who sang that song also had S.

262
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:05,250
What?

263
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:06,290
Yeah.

264
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,310
Wow, she said that.

265
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,050
That's new information to me.

266
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:14,350
So, does it mean that, what does it mean, make the dragoons and wisp?

267
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:14,630
What is that?

268
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,970
Wait, what does that make the dragoon or wisp?

269
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:18,870
What do you mean by that?

270
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:22,550
And the entire concert, does it mean that it starts with an O?

271
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:24,110
What?

272
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:31,450
Oh, I mean, you gotta make children so you can size kids to subscribe to me, right?

273
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:36,690
How else am I going to get some million subscribers, guys?

274
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:37,630
We need more children.

275
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,670
Okay, no, we don't need more children to subscribe because that's illegal.

276
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:42,750
I don't want to be marked as a kids channel.

277
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:53,290
We need more 13 and up users to subscribe to my channel because at best I'm at least PG-13.

278
00:16:55,150 --> 00:17:02,650
Yeah, how else will we get more subscribers, guys?

279
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:06,890
That's the way I'll answer that.

280
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:09,050
I will not explain further.

281
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:13,450
Hello?

282
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:14,590
Hey!

283
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:18,370
Hey, who is the tomato cowboy here to challenge?

284
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:20,410
Oh, that guy?

285
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:21,670
He doesn't matter.

286
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:28,430
That's my meal for tomorrow.

287
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:36,670
Hello, this is a Doki bird panel, not some random tomato in the background.

288
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:37,470
Hello?

289
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,570
There we go.

290
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:41,590
Now you don't need to look at him anymore.

291
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,390
I'm not centered.

292
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,910
This is going to piss me off.

293
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:51,990
Never mind.

294
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:53,550
I'm not centered.

295
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:02,650
So, you always tell us to get up and move around all the time, right?

296
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:07,930
The question is, how much do you get up and move around in your time?

297
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,950
I literally went to Atlanta.

298
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,810
That is the most giddy...

299
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:15,590
I did a concert, bro.

300
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:16,750
I danced.

301
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:18,550
I touched grass.

302
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,670
No, did I actually touch grass?

303
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:21,510
Oh my god, no.

304
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,510
I have a dog.

305
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,770
I have to walk that... Oh, sorry.

306
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,930
I have to walk that freak.

307
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:33,430
Okay, I'm sorry.

308
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:34,390
He's not a freak.

309
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:35,690
He's not a freak.

310
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,990
I love my dog.

311
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:41,850
I have to walk him at least twice a day.

312
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,410
So I do get up and move around.

313
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:47,370
Check, how much do you move?

314
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:50,410
Oh, you're at a convention, so you're literally outside right now.

315
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:55,790
Yes, I do touch grass.

316
00:18:56,030 --> 00:19:00,690
I literally physically have to touch grass so that my dog will poop on the grass.

317
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:13,230
I understand that getting a new outfit takes months, sometimes years, depending on certain things.

318
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:20,890
Is there any oddball, throw-it-a-long-mile outfit idea that you've always wanted?

319
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:26,690
That doesn't spoil anything you might have coming up, I guess.

320
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:27,570
I don't know.

321
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:30,230
I guess I always liked military outfits.

322
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:37,170
Yeah, military outfits are always cool because you always look really cool.

323
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:39,830
So that's one thing I would love to have in the future.

324
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:46,050
I have no plans for a military outfit right now, but something I definitely want in the future.

325
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:50,590
I guess definitely a casual outfit, for sure.

326
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:55,330
A casual military outfit seems to be like...

327
00:19:55,330 --> 00:20:03,550
Honestly, I feel like every VTuber always has either a military or casual outfit as a checklist for VTubers.

328
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:05,850
And then everything else is just bonus.

329
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:11,830
But yeah, most likely those two would be something I'll get in the future.

330
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:15,870
But they're not the outfits that are planned for 2025.

331
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:21,650
Doki, I really love you and I want to ask you a question.

332
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:24,230
Yeah, this is a Q&A.

333
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,210
Yeah, Q&A.

334
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,390
Will you marry me?

335
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,290
I'll do a backflip for you.

336
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,130
Sorry, did he say that?

337
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:34,230
I'll do a backflip.

338
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:37,570
Oh wait, no, don't do a backflip because I might be liable.

339
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:45,530
Unless the convention has a liability contract, you could do a backflip.

340
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,370
But I don't think they're going to endorse that for me.

341
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,910
Alright, next question.

342
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:56,010
Hey Doki.

343
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,470
What's your favorite anime?

344
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,330
What's my favorite anime?

345
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:02,910
Okay, Death Note.

346
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:07,850
It's honestly the anime that got me into anime.

347
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:15,990
I am basically the most normie VTuber you could sort of watch.

348
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:22,230
I always talk about this, but I don't watch a lot of anime.

349
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:29,310
And when I do, it's most likely one of the top animes that everybody's watching right now.

350
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,310
You gotta watch it.

351
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:33,850
But even then, I feel like I only watch one anime series a year.

352
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:38,710
Oh my god, you're such a hypocrite, Doki.

353
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:39,590
You're an anime girl.

354
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:40,870
You don't even watch anime.

355
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:45,590
So instead of watching anime, I watch stuff like Young Sheldon.

356
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:48,490
Which is an incredibly great show.

357
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:51,470
It's not like Big Bang Theory, by the way.

358
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:55,790
It's a great show and I cried at the finale, okay?

359
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:00,790
So I watch stuff like Young Sheldon.

360
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:02,750
There's... oh my god, what's that?

361
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:05,710
There's that new school show.

362
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:10,350
It's basically like The Office, but at a school.

363
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:11,670
I think it's elementary.

364
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:12,670
I think that's what it's called.

365
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:14,050
But it's also really good.

366
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:16,270
I saw it and I'm like, what's your favorite anime?

367
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:19,070
And I'm like, yo, this is my normie shows that I watch.

368
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:19,430
Like...

369
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:29,070
And then I watch cartoons like Crapopolis and stuff like that.

370
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,730
Which I was so surprised, apparently.

371
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:34,430
It's written by the guy who wrote Community and everything.

372
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,590
But anyway, anime!

373
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:42,450
Death Note's my favorite anime because it actually got me looking into anime.

374
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:45,190
And also collecting figures and stuff like that.

375
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:47,830
Because I was like, oh I must have a Death Note nendoroid.

376
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:50,470
Speaking of nendoroids, let me show you my nendoroid real quick.

377
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:52,730
Hey guys!

378
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:55,030
And people who don't know who I am...

379
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,390
I have a nendoroid!

380
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:57,250
Whoa!

381
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:59,370
Look at that!

382
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,670
You should totally buy it.

383
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:06,850
Anyway, show's over.

384
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:18,870
But anyway, I love Death Note because the concept and the artwork was so cool.

385
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:20,810
And I've always liked the artist and the author.

386
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:22,870
I also like Bakuman.

387
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,170
I love Bakuman.

388
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:25,490
I wish it was more popular.

389
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:30,450
But it's honestly such a good manga and anime series.

390
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:37,830
But then as I got older, I realized how stupid Light is.

391
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:43,090
Because he's supposed to be so freaking smart and everything.

392
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:48,230
And then when you get older, you're like, oh my god, no, he's just an edgy teenager.

393
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:53,490
He's just this edgy teenager with a huge ass ego.

394
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:55,770
Which is like every teenager to be fair.

395
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:59,770
Every teenager that's like, I'm smarter than you type shit.

396
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:04,430
And then back then, I was like, oh my god, Light, you're so smart.

397
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:09,110
But now I'm like, oh no, he's like those edgy teenagers and everything.

398
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:12,850
Anyway, but yes, Death Note is my favorite anime of all time.

399
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:19,510
I still love Death Note even though growing up, I realized Light's not as great as I thought he was.

400
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:25,830
Doki, what would you say the meaning of life is?

401
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:27,710
Is it 42?

402
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,890
Would it be 42 if I just said the wrong number?

403
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:37,450
What was that?

404
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:39,650
Is that from Hitchhiker's Guide of... oh my god, I love that.

405
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:40,590
I love that movie.

406
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:43,950
Hitchhiker's Guide of the Galaxy, it's such a great movie.

407
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:46,170
Oh my god, when did that movie come out?

408
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:48,150
Sorry, off topic right now.

409
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:53,210
Just like my streams, we're gonna go off topic.

410
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:56,510
It has a 60% on Rotten Tomatoes?

411
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:58,950
It came out in 2005?

412
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:01,990
Oh my god, that's 20 years ago.

413
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:02,970
Wait, is it 20?

414
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,270
Oh my god, that's 20.

415
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:08,230
Hitchhiker's Guide of the Galaxy is 20 years ago, that's crazy.

416
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:11,150
If you guys never watched it, it's a very good movie.

417
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:15,010
And honestly, it has like the best opening song I've ever heard.

418
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,530
Alright, next question.

419
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:22,070
Just to brag against Mint even more, will you please marry me?

420
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:23,930
I'll support you in all your projects.

421
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:31,680
Alright, next question.

422
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,980
Hey, what if she can say it's no, right?

423
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,980
So going along with the weird questions, two things.

424
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,880
What's your thought about Fi and Mennie Says Hi?

425
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:55,840
Okay, okay.

426
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:02,520
Dude, sometimes like some dragoons should not be allowed to talk.

427
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:16,060
Yeah, you know, sometimes I think like some dragoons don't deserve rights.

428
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,180
And these...

429
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,360
Anyway, next question.

430
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,320
So Doki, what's your opinion on Jeff the Shark and Marvel Rivals?

431
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,420
Oh my god, no, okay.

432
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:46,820
I talked about it before on stream, but like, you know like when everyone was like, oh my god, it's gonna be like Overwatch again where people are gonna start up their Patreons again and bring up SFMs again.

433
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,680
It's gonna be the return of SFN animations on Patreon, if you know what I mean.

434
00:26:53,260 --> 00:27:08,320
And so like, you know, the moment when the models got exported, the first thing people made was like, was like trying, it was beating up Jeff the Shark.

435
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:25,740
And so I was like, the fact that like, the fact that like spite and anger triumphs horniness says a lot about how hated Jeff the Shark is in Marvel Rivals.

436
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:33,000
It's the fact that was the very first animation you saw from Marvel, like fan-made animation you saw from creators.

437
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:40,020
And that's when you know, Jaws was right.

438
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,800
We should have listened to what they said.

439
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,400
Alright, next question.

440
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:56,280
Hi, what's your opinion on mint chocolate?

441
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,260
Mint chocolate?

442
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,440
I like white chocolate more.

443
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,940
Honestly, I heard someone was like, damn it!

444
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:08,780
What?

445
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,480
It's better chocolate!

446
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:16,220
People are like, oh, dark chocolate is the healthiest, but that shit tastes like, it tastes terrible.

447
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:16,820
It's so bitter.

448
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:17,840
I don't understand.

449
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,340
I like milk chocolate the most.

450
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:25,140
Yeah, I'm not giving you fan service, by the way.

451
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:28,780
Hi, Doki.

452
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:37,820
Before I ask my question, I just want to say that Marvel Rivals is a drug and I'm having withdrawals since I couldn't, I can't play anymore since I flew here.

453
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,040
That was me during the concert, don't worry.

454
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:50,280
Anyways, my question is, when you have free time to watch other content creators and VTubers, what do you usually look for in them?

455
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,440
And who do you watch?

456
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,740
Oh, my God.

457
00:28:53,100 --> 00:29:00,420
Okay, well, like, okay, so, um, like, you all know I have a problem.

458
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:06,820
So like now I basically all I do is just watch Marvel Rivals streams.

459
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:11,060
I watch like top high competitive Marvel Rivals streams.

460
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:17,060
So I literally watch like I fall asleep to Marvel Rivals, and I watch Marvel Rivals on my free time.

461
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:20,640
And I'm not watching Marvel Rivals.

462
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,360
I'm playing Marvel Rivals.

463
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:26,800
So this is a problem for me right now.

464
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,140
But like, I guess like other streams I watch.

465
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,420
Oh, my gosh.

466
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:32,980
Okay, let me look.

467
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,540
Oh, that's really, oh, my gosh.

468
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:42,700
Because like, instead of watching streams, I just watch shows, TV shows instead, or YouTube videos.

469
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:50,420
Because like, I have, I don't have ADHD, but I do have a very short attention span.

470
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:56,580
So I can't sit too long watching like a stream sometimes.

471
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:01,740
So I like to watch like, you know, short porn content, like, I am addicted to shorts as well.

472
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:11,380
So like, I would just browse YouTube shorts, and like learn so many fun facts and like, or lies on the internet, because some of these YouTube short facts are actual lies.

473
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:18,680
And then I would regurgitate the lies to you guys and be like, Oh, my God, I heard about this cool, true, very true fact, guys.

474
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,320
But like, yeah, it's usually it.

475
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,140
Like, I guess I would watch like streams from my friends too.

476
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:29,080
So like, collab with and stuff like that.

477
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:32,040
And just like comment in their channels and stuff like that.

478
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:41,200
So usually, other than like, my friends stuff, I just usually just watch like short form content on YouTube, or like Marvel Rivals, because that's a problem.

479
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:46,480
Hello, there's a lot of new games announced recently.

480
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:50,980
Are there any upcoming Marvel Rivals that you're excited to play on screen?

481
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:56,780
Okay, um, oh my gosh, that Pac-Man game.

482
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:17,660
No, okay, that Pac-Man game is like, it's like what it's apparently some like edgy heart like Pac-Man game where they reimagined the entire series, which is pretty like when I saw the trailer, I was like, I was just like, where's Pac-Man in this Pac-Man game?

483
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:33,800
And then I was making fun of that was an anthology series where they're like, because we all made fun of the trailer for the anthology series of Pac-Man, not knowing that was just a teaser for an actual video game.

484
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,900
Because I was like, where did they get this idea?

485
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:41,560
You saw I was like, oh my god, it's gonna be a real game.

486
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:50,500
Honestly, like all the other okay, I want to know, I want to know what the hell is up with the cat AI game.

487
00:31:50,500 --> 00:32:08,800
Because like, not quote unquote excited, but like, obviously, they must have paid millions of dollars to like get on the Game Awards, because it was apparently like very AI.

488
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:16,760
And then but then like the fact that they're releasing it on Steam, and Apple Watch is the most crazy combination of game releases.

489
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:21,800
Like, I was like, what, why is it on the Apple Watch of all things?

490
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:25,040
Like, what am I gonna do with this cat on my Apple Watch?

491
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:33,460
I assume it's like something where you bring your AI cat around with you if it's on the goddamn Apple Watch.

492
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:41,920
Um, but yeah, no, those two games I'm the most excited about one is gonna be a train wreck, which I'm excited to see how that's gonna come up.

493
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:48,640
And then the other one is just what what the hell is gonna the pacman game is just very interesting concept.

494
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,480
So that's definitely something I'm interested in.

495
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,940
Other than that, I think that's really it.

496
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,360
Any other questions?

497
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,820
See people.

498
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:02,920
Hello.

499
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:11,860
Hi, if there were a game of the Sajam Slam did besides Tekken or Street Fighter, what game would you want to play if you were to enter again?

500
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,240
Oh, my.

501
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:19,380
I was thinking like, I don't know a lot about street like not sure.

502
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:23,260
I don't know a lot about like, different types of fighting games and stuff like that.

503
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:42,740
It's like obviously Tekken and Street Fighter are like the classics, but like the two that I really would love to see implemented is okay, the first one would be obviously Mortal Kombat because like, that's a classic and I want to be I want to be a Homelander.

504
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,920
Just for the finisher.

505
00:33:49,450 --> 00:34:05,010
Because the fact that like, if it was ever a Sajam Slam game, tournament game, and I was Homelander, I would 100% hardcore train just so I can use the Homelander finisher, and then have Sajam watch that every time.

506
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:13,570
Have like, 20,000 people see that every single match.

507
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:24,430
For those who don't know what the Homelander finisher is, it's basically, he drinks milk, but if you understand the show, you know where the milk comes from.

508
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:28,290
So, that's why I really would love it.

509
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:43,490
The second one would actually be Them's Fighting Herds, just because I've always, I remember like following the progress of that fighting game because it was, it used to be like a My Little Pony fighting game, and Hasbro was like, what the hell are you doing?

510
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:53,290
So it got, but like Lauren Frost, I always loved Lauren Frost's work, because I always loved her art style and like the stuff she does.

511
00:34:53,730 --> 00:35:07,390
For those who don't know who Lauren Frost is, she was the creator of the My Little Pony show for that generation, and she made like other, she also helped out on Powerpuff Girls, and she's married to the guy that made Dexter's Laboratory in Powerpuff Girls.

512
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:09,330
So like, I thought that was really interesting.

513
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:13,130
She's married, she's getting married to the guy who made Powerpuff Girls.

514
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:20,810
And I always loved her stuff, and like, you know, she was like really, she was also like, what the hell, Hasbro?

515
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:33,710
So she redesigned all the concepts and the characters for that fan-made fighting game, My Little Pony fighting game, and then it became an actual fighting game called Them's Fighting Herds.

516
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:39,110
So I would love to see that too, because apparently it's a really good fighting game, with the animation and everything.

517
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:40,350
So I thought it was really interesting.

518
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:43,290
Okay, next question.

519
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:53,030
Hey Doki, what's your like go-to food when you're traveling or away from home?

520
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:58,370
Like for me, if I'm traveling to Japan, I have to eat an egg sandwich at least once a day.

521
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:01,550
Oh, honestly, true though.

522
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:03,730
I love Japanese egg sandwiches.

523
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:07,130
It's because you're made with the, what was it called?

524
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:09,430
The special mayonnaise sauce?

525
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:09,790
I forgot.

526
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:12,110
It's like, the one with the baby on it.

527
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:14,850
The one with the baby on the bottom.

528
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:15,490
That's why.

529
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,010
Oh, Kewpie.

530
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:16,870
Yeah, Kewpie mayonnaise.

531
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:18,910
That's why it makes it so good.

532
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:23,250
Honestly, it depends on the country I'm going to.

533
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:39,390
Honestly, like whenever I travel to a place, it wouldn't be like comfort food, but I would at least once go to a Michelin star restaurant for a new place I'm at.

534
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:42,850
Because I always want to be like, I'm at a new area.

535
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:49,210
So for those who don't know what Michelin star restaurants are, they're basically the most bougie as hell place to be.

536
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:52,230
But I'm like, I'm at a new area.

537
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:53,170
I'm in a new country.

538
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:54,890
And I can try it once.

539
00:36:55,070 --> 00:37:00,110
So I was like, oh my gosh, this is my one time I get to splurge a little bit.

540
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:07,870
And like, honestly, like the only thing I splurge on is like artist alley at conventions, and like food, because like, gotta treat yourself.

541
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:11,690
So like, I always try to do like a Michelin star restaurant.

542
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:14,570
Also, like, make sure you read what they serve.

543
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:25,090
Because in Japan, I went to a Michelin star restaurant in Japan, and I didn't realize like 90% of the meals that they serve was like mushrooms.

544
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,090
And I hate mushrooms.

545
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:41,190
So I was like, I think I paid like 200 plus dollars, like American dollar, you convert it to like 200 plus dollars for food I can't even like eat and enjoy.

546
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:42,810
And then they're like, wow.

547
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:48,290
And you know, like, you know, when you're at a nice restaurant, they'll come over and be like, Oh, did you enjoy your food?

548
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:49,730
And obviously I lied.

549
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:54,370
So I'm like, I don't want to be like, no, I hate it.

550
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:59,470
You don't want to like be rude in Japan.

551
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:01,790
So I'm like, Oh my gosh, no, it was amazing.

552
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:06,070
And inside, I'm just like, I kept the 200 dollars.

553
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:07,090
Um,

554
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:17,090
but yeah, I don't really have like, a specific comfort food in mind.

555
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:22,710
Um, it's just mostly I just go to a nice place at least once during my travels.

556
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:35,550
Doki, since you did a FNAF song at ALA, will you do FNAF karaoke or any other horror song karaoke?

557
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:39,570
Is there actually more songs?

558
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:45,990
I feel like the only FNAF song I know is the original FNAF song.

559
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,710
Honestly, like, I don't know.

560
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:58,870
The other ones I know are like, not, I mean, to be fair, The Living Tombstones was like, the FNAF from The Living Tombstone is a fan song for FNAF.

561
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:02,030
But like, other than that, I think like, that's like the most famous one.

562
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:03,590
And also the only one I know.

563
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:08,230
The other ones I know are like, the Bendy and the Ink Machine.

564
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:14,190
I know so many Bendy and the Ink Machine fan songs.

565
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,910
Because I wasn't a FNAF girl.

566
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:19,430
I was more of a Bendy girl.

567
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:23,870
That sounds so messed up out of context.

568
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:35,950
But I preferred, back when, like, it was, you know, back when the mascot horror genre was a thing, I never got into FNAF because I hate animatronics.

569
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:38,070
Like, I have an immense fear of animatronics.

570
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:43,890
I can't even do, like, It's a Small World because in my head, I'm like, what if there's so many tiny-ass animatronics?

571
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:47,270
And I'm like, wouldn't they just come alive and just kill me?

572
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:48,830
Like, I don't know.

573
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:54,090
I'm just like, oh my god, like, what if just suddenly I'm on this boat and they just lock them alive?

574
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:57,990
Like, I cannot do animatronics because I have such an immense fear.

575
00:39:58,110 --> 00:40:03,230
So I never played FNAF until, like, I guess, like, a year ago I played it.

576
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:07,430
And like, so I never really got into FNAF.

577
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:11,030
And then like, I know people are like, what about the Zora FNAF?

578
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:17,610
Like, okay, we all know Scott was making shit up as he went along.

579
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,590
So like, I never really cared.

580
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:23,510
But like Bendy, Bendy actually had, like, really good lore.

581
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:26,830
And like, I was an animation, like, cartoon freak.

582
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:32,270
So like, I really, like, related more to Bendy and the Ink Machine than I did with FNAF.

583
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:37,190
You know, I know FNAF is like, more popular and like, oh my god, is that the fight of 87?

584
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:38,570
Or is it 97?

585
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:39,330
Or is it 45?

586
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:40,430
I really lost track.

587
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:41,510
There were too many numbers.

588
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:46,830
And next question.

589
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:55,010
Hi, Doki, really important question.

590
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:56,770
Is water wet?

591
00:40:58,450 --> 00:40:59,230
All right.

592
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:04,530
I mean, I hope I assumed.

593
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:06,050
Wait, how is that?

594
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:09,470
Oh my god, am I too stupid to understand like how it's not wet?

595
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:13,910
Like, I'd say yes, it's wet.

596
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:14,890
Water is wet.

597
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:18,450
I don't know how it could be debated against.

598
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:20,850
Am I just done?

599
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:26,250
All right, next question.

600
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:29,110
All right, we have about time for one more good question.

601
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:31,470
Oh my god, it's been an hour already?

602
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:33,090
Wow.

603
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:34,650
Hi,

604
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:43,170
Doki, I have the most important question of all.

605
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:51,470
You can only have one of the two infinite, infinite bacon, but no more games or infinite games, but no games.

606
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:53,150
What?

607
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:01,030
Infinite games, but no games?

608
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:11,230
Oh, is it like, oh, it's like a Humble Bundle type deal where you buy the Humble Bundle and you play none of the games.

609
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:21,950
Like, um, well, like none of them has has gaming as an option, but like the other one has bacon.

610
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:26,410
So it's like, do you want something or do you want nothing?

611
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:34,550
So I guess I choose bacon because like, why would I want infinite games if I can't even all the games are like dog shit?

612
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:37,090
What am I going to do?

613
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:43,010
Might as well just just watch a stream and live my life through that person then.

614
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:49,230
On the other hand, I get bacon and I can eat bacon and watch people stream.

615
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:55,710
So that's that's I can't believe that's the question we're ending on for this panel.

616
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:00,230
That's my final answer.

617
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:03,750
You could probably squeeze in one more.

618
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:07,930
Q&A guy was like, that question was pretty bad.

619
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:09,110
Let's get another one in.

620
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:09,970
All

621
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:28,980
right, the final question, your question is going to end this entire panel better be a really good one.

622
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,260
There's really high expectations.

623
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,920
This is a really good question.

624
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:42,400
Hey, Doki, so since at the concert, you played Marble Rivals in the concert, does that mean you're going to play a game here?

625
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,540
Why not?

626
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:50,860
Wait, am I allowed to?

627
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:52,660
Oh, wait.

628
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:54,620
I don't know if you guys can hear sound though from this.

629
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:59,520
It follows my chat microphone.

630
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:02,720
I mean, okay, I'm down.

631
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:06,680
All right, I can squeeze again.

632
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:10,360
Okay, I'm not doing like I'm not losing my GM in front of all of you.

633
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:17,100
I'm not doing that in front of all of you guys.

634
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:18,760
Let's see.

635
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:21,740
All right.

636
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:22,360
Oh, my gosh.

637
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:22,720
Okay.

638
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:23,220
Okay.

639
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:32,880
I hope that I can actually put up Marble Rivals because like I didn't restart my PC and like there is a 50% chance that I would my game would crash.

640
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:41,660
Oh, my gosh.

641
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:42,340
Is it on?

642
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:42,840
Oh, my gosh.

643
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:43,320
Why is it on?

644
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:43,880
Oh, yeah.

645
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:44,960
Because I had a sponsor.

646
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:46,600
I was like, why is it on?

647
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:47,500
Singularity?

648
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:48,700
I was like, oh, yeah.

649
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:49,480
Oh, my God.

650
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:50,700
She's actually doing it.

651
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:51,980
She's doing it.

652
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:55,500
All right.

653
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:56,620
I don't think you guys can.

654
00:44:56,620 --> 00:45:02,580
I don't know if you guys can hear the game sound because like I said, the microphone, the audio is on my microphone, not on my game.

655
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:06,420
You're gonna watch me play without sound.

656
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:07,300
You don't need sound.

657
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,280
I'll make sound effects for you guys.

658
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:10,180
All right, Doki.

659
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:15,320
You might see next to me here that there's a guy with a little ring camera.

660
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:17,460
And we're about to see it.

661
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:18,560
It's about to get zoomed into.

662
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:21,820
And I believe this is the same one that was at the concert.

663
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:23,220
Oh, my God.

664
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:23,700
Really?

665
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:24,720
It's you.

666
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:26,180
All right.

667
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:26,920
Here we go.

668
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:29,740
I was actually like, I didn't know it was like, oh, my God.

669
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:30,380
It's InstaQ.

670
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:31,040
Thank God.

671
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:32,900
There's too many people.

672
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:35,940
Oh, it's Ka, King of the Hill.

673
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:37,000
All right.

674
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:42,360
I mean, this is, oh, I'm feeling, this is gonna be a quick game.

675
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,000
I'm feeling.

676
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:45,860
Not Luna Snow?

677
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:47,160
Oh, my God.

678
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,180
Guys, I'm here to carry.

679
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:50,580
I don't trust play.

680
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:52,500
I don't trust quick play players.

681
00:45:54,660 --> 00:46:05,080
There's no, like, skill-based matchmaking in quick play, which is crazy because I can literally, I can solo carry as Luna in quick play, which is crazy to think about.

682
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:06,560
You gotta give us the sound effects.

683
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:07,480
I'm not hearing any sound effects.

684
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:07,740
Okay.

685
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:10,060
I just realized my own sound was off, too.

686
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:13,060
All right.

687
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:16,340
Look at that.

688
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:17,380
Goodbye.

689
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:19,300
Oh, my God.

690
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,020
He has a Hawkeye.

691
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:21,720
I've never seen a Hawkeye in 20 years.

692
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:22,980
It's always bad.

693
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,720
By the way, they made it so that, oh, we're spawn camping them.

694
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:29,320
I don't even have to exist.

695
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:31,120
Oh, no, we're not spawn camping them.

696
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:33,580
We are not spawn camping them anymore.

697
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:34,680
Okay.

698
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:37,640
Oh, my God.

699
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:38,440
Oh, my God.

700
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:39,440
Oh, please.

701
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:44,620
This is not fair.

702
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:46,760
I haven't seen Hawkeye in 20 years.

703
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,540
He's always bad in rank.

704
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:51,960
Nobody likes to play against Hawkeye.

705
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:53,580
All right.

706
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:55,640
I'm running.

707
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:57,540
She's jumping and I'm running.

708
00:46:58,300 --> 00:46:59,420
All right, let's go.

709
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:01,060
There's no way we lose this.

710
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:03,460
We have a Fister.

711
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:07,060
I need the audience to get hyped when she gets a build.

712
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:09,260
I need the audience to get upset when she gets a build.

713
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,460
Oh, you think you're gonna go invisible?

714
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,460
She went invisible, guys.

715
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,240
She did go invisible.

716
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:23,160
I DPS now.

717
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:25,000
Oh, you're gonna do this again?

718
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:25,960
Get over here.

719
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:27,500
I know where you're going.

720
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:28,200
That's right.

721
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:31,640
Easy.

722
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,680
That's how you play Mantis.

723
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,060
You don't care about your team.

724
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:39,720
You DPS.

725
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:45,740
I actually need to learn Mantis headshots more.

726
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:47,420
All right.

727
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,580
All right, we'll do our favorite.

728
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,340
We'll do Jeff.

729
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:55,440
Wait, is this a good map?

730
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:57,760
I don't even know if this is a good map for Jeff.

731
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:58,480
Oh, well.

732
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,580
I never play Jeff because he's bad.

733
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,180
He's bad in rank.

734
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,760
But like, this is quick play.

735
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,380
And we all hate Jeff here.

736
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:11,480
All right.

737
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:12,620
Yay!

738
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:18,420
Wait, do we actually have tank?

739
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,160
Oh my God.

740
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:23,940
We actually have like a person that's really willing to play tank.

741
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:25,600
That's crazy.

742
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:33,300
I think one thing I like about Jeff is that he sings a little song when you're swimming.

743
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,060
He's like, He's like copyright-free Jaws theme song.

744
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:42,340
I love that we put so much work to bring you out here, and you end up playing Marble Rivals again.

745
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:44,120
I know, I'm gonna play Marble Rivals rank after.

746
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:46,320
This is my warm-up before my actual...

747
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:48,640
All right.

748
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,140
What is she doing?

749
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:52,580
Oh, that's what she's...

750
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,260
God, I hate Hawkeye.

751
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,460
I hate him so much.

752
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,900
Yet, this person cannot play Hawkeye in actual rank.

753
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:05,320
So he has to live vicariously in quick play.

754
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:10,320
No one ever lets people play Hawkeye.

755
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:12,580
And for a good reason.

756
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:18,420
I actually sort of low-key forgot how to play Jeff.

757
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,280
I was like, what do I have?

758
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,140
What's my utility?

759
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:24,620
No one plays Jeff.

760
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:29,540
Oh, no, no, no, please, please, keep me awake.

761
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:30,100
No!

762
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,480
You know, Jeff is dog shit.

763
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:33,140
I hate him.

764
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:38,280
Wait, no, no, wait, wait.

765
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:39,740
I gotta use my ult, though.

766
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:41,320
I'm almost at ult.

767
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:42,820
And then I'll carry.

768
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:44,680
Alright.

769
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:46,500
Don't worry.

770
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,240
I figured it out.

771
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:50,820
I'll actually help...

772
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:52,900
Alright.

773
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:54,460
Get over here.

774
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,080
Whoa!

775
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:00,080
No!

776
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:02,960
The shootout!

777
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:07,560
It's quick play!

778
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:10,100
You actually shoot the...

779
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:13,660
People in rank don't even shoot the shark.

780
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:16,200
Hahahahaha!

781
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:20,520
Nobody shoots a goddamn shark in rank!

782
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:25,080
And you do it in quick play?!

783
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,140
Okay.

784
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:27,580
I'm fine.

785
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:29,400
Now I actually will play the game.

786
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,160
Alright, that's fine.

787
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:34,880
Sleep!

788
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:36,100
Oh, he's not sleeping.

789
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:37,100
Okay.

790
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:39,000
Go!

791
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,560
Go do your thing!

792
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,720
Now we have three supports, but that's okay.

793
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,020
I'm my own DPS.

794
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:45,400
Oh, that's not okay!

795
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:46,780
I am so sorry.

796
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:50,820
I almost killed the crew.

797
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:52,620
Come on!

798
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:57,360
Guys, I know this looks bad.

799
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,640
Guys, this is why this is my warm-up.

800
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:05,520
I'm low-key through on Jeff, but like, it'll be different now.

801
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:09,860
It'll be different next game.

802
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,820
Next round, we'll win this.

803
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:18,070
We'll win this next round.

804
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:25,130
You're like, we can squeeze one game in with Lillian and Coff.

805
00:51:25,370 --> 00:51:28,170
This is actually the shortest one too.

806
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:32,810
Like, if we did like an attack or a defense, that would take forever.

807
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:34,730
That would actually take forever.

808
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:39,230
All right, don't worry, guys.

809
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:41,210
I can carry this.

810
00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:42,170
I swear to God.

811
00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:48,690
I had time to queue one game.

812
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:50,070
Oh yeah, there's an event!

813
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:50,950
I forgot.

814
00:51:51,810 --> 00:51:54,870
Little do they know, I'm streaming this at a convention right now too.

815
00:51:59,870 --> 00:52:03,170
Left a negative review on Steam for this event.

816
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:05,830
Damn, that's messed up.

817
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:11,870
Oh, team will take this game way too soon.

818
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:12,470
This is...

819
00:52:13,590 --> 00:52:15,370
If you queue, snipe the streamers.

820
00:52:15,470 --> 00:52:17,470
Oh yeah, the free skins.

821
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:20,450
All right, go do your thing, little guy.

822
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:33,130
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, this hot guy is actually a problem.

823
00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:35,370
It's such a problem.

824
00:52:35,830 --> 00:52:40,530
I forget how to play against him because you never get a chance to play against him.

825
00:52:42,110 --> 00:52:44,050
All right, okay, this time.

826
00:52:44,770 --> 00:52:46,730
Now that I know... what the fuck?

827
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:50,490
Oh no, no, he got... there we go.

828
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:55,690
Oh my god, you have an orb.

829
00:52:55,990 --> 00:52:56,610
That's not fair.

830
00:52:57,510 --> 00:53:00,810
You actually have orbs to make sure you live.

831
00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:03,410
Where is my team?

832
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:04,490
Are they okay?

833
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:09,130
Are they... god, you actually have teammates.

834
00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:11,430
Guys, this ain't looking good.

835
00:53:11,590 --> 00:53:15,890
I was very confident now, but like, I don't know why they decided to lock in.

836
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:21,510
I don't know why they decided to lock in.

837
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:23,670
I might need to bring out the main now.

838
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,770
Oh no, not the hot guy.

839
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:28,010
I don't want to look at him.

840
00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:29,550
I don't want to look at him.

841
00:53:29,630 --> 00:53:31,050
He's actually good.

842
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:32,510
Okay.

843
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:38,930
Oh my god, there's a problem with you.

844
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:41,910
There is a problem with you.

845
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:45,150
Get out.

846
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:50,090
Oh, he's gonna group.

847
00:53:50,350 --> 00:53:51,490
He is 100% gonna group.

848
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:53,230
Please, where's my cloak?

849
00:53:53,450 --> 00:53:54,850
Cloak, where did you go?

850
00:53:54,850 --> 00:53:56,910
I thought he was with me.

851
00:53:57,730 --> 00:53:59,050
You ran away?

852
00:54:00,610 --> 00:54:02,590
Support and strong together.

853
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:07,990
Oh my god, I thought we were friends.

854
00:54:08,650 --> 00:54:11,610
Now I know I'll never heal this other support again.

855
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:15,530
All right, maybe we'll have a good Hawkeye too.

856
00:54:17,510 --> 00:54:18,530
Oh, goodbye.

857
00:54:18,810 --> 00:54:19,210
He's dead.

858
00:54:19,930 --> 00:54:20,510
He's dead.

859
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:22,850
This is why I want to cut all trees down too.

860
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:30,610
Okay, oh, oh, okay.

861
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:33,530
He's, he's just gonna block me.

862
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:34,190
That's fine.

863
00:54:47,010 --> 00:54:52,830
Okay, guys, we might have lost, but it's not my fault.

864
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:03,270
I, I did the best I could in the situation I was in.

865
00:55:05,890 --> 00:55:10,470
Oh my god, how do I have more damage than our Hawkeye?

866
00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:14,730
I told you he's a problem.

867
00:55:15,470 --> 00:55:19,050
11k damage and our Hawkeye has 4k.

868
00:55:19,370 --> 00:55:21,950
I told you guys, this is not my fault.

869
00:55:22,850 --> 00:55:27,570
I literally failed and I was able to pull off more damage than our Hawkeye.

870
00:55:28,210 --> 00:55:33,930
All right, and this is why Marble Rivals is a bad for you, because I would have queued another one if I could.

871
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:37,910
All right, Doki, any last words?

872
00:55:38,350 --> 00:55:39,110
Any last words?

873
00:55:39,810 --> 00:55:40,950
Um, buy my merch.

874
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:45,870
All right, guys, make some noise for Doki.

875
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:47,150
Yeah,

876
00:55:51,070 --> 00:55:52,490
I'll thank you again.

877
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:56,590
I was, I had a great time at the panel.

878
00:55:57,070 --> 00:55:59,470
It's really great meeting all my Dragoons, as always.

879
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:01,470
Hope you guys enjoy holiday Matsuri.

880
00:56:06,370 --> 00:56:07,010
Bye.

881
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:18,100
All right, guys, um, another jank stream.

882
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:21,980
Uh, go to Hawkeye.

883
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:23,080
Hawkeye Shilling.

884
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:24,140
Shilling for Hawkeye.

885
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:25,320
Go to Hawkeye.

886
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:27,480
Thank you, Oshie Oasis.

887
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:29,440
All right, ending stream.
