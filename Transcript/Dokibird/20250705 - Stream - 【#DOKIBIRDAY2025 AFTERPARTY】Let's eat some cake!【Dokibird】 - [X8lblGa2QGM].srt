1
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,170
Hello, everybody.

2
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:46,970
Hello, hello.

3
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:52,350
Yes, now we're actually in a proper, uh, birthday setting now.

4
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:56,770
So, did you guys enjoy the concert?

5
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:57,430
Did you?

6
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:05,130
The one-time showing of that, the, the, the Anime Expo concert version.

7
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:10,790
I know some of you guys, I saw some of you guys were like, wait, this is like the non-polished version?

8
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:11,590
Yeah.

9
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:22,490
Yes, because, um, one of the things that I am planning on redoing is, um, Escape from the City.

10
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:31,090
I mentioned this before in a previous stream, but, uh, I am planning on redoing, um, the motion capture for Escape from the City.

11
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:43,430
Because, I talked about this before, but it was because you can sort of tell that we recorded the Escape from the City motion capture thing individually.

12
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:50,390
Because, obviously, we couldn't... we didn't know how to interact with each other.

13
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,950
Like, Mint did hers in Japan and everything too.

14
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:57,230
And so we're like, how do we... we have to stand there.

15
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,530
Ha ha ha ha...

16
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,590
So...

17
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:02,770
So...

18
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:10,810
We were like, we didn't know how to like, um, how to interact because we don't know where they were, like where the other person was.

19
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:21,150
And so, um, that's why, like, you can tell, like, we were like, oh man, like, the energy for it is like different from the other...

20
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:27,300
Uh, obviously the other sets because, like, the other ones, it was like easier to do, uh, for the concert.

21
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:36,370
Um, that is like one of the things, uh, uh, one of the things that, uh, the sloppiest thing was...

22
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:40,250
Haha, Joe, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

23
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:43,270
Haha, yeah, yeah.

24
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:47,290
Um, oh wait, sorry, I forgot, I knew I forgot to include something.

25
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:50,150
I forgot to include chat in my...

26
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,150
Okay, I was like, yay, I fit everything.

27
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,090
Oh no, okay.

28
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:54,530
Oh wait, I did, you're right there.

29
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:55,470
I forgot you're just sitting there.

30
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:58,850
Yeah, no, chat's broken because I didn't put a new chat in here.

31
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,510
Um, this was from the outfit reveal chat.

32
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,610
Haha, there you go.

33
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:06,530
I was like, where are you guys?

34
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,370
Oh, you're down here.

35
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,130
Hello, little guy.

36
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:11,050
Haha, hello, short king.

37
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:12,190
Haha,

38
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:23,010
so that is one of the things, um, I'm planning on, um, I'm planning on redoing.

39
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:29,550
Um, that's why, uh, but I will be adding, like, two new songs in the concert just so it'll be, like, much more worth it.

40
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:44,470
So there's, like, some things that, you know, because it'll be my first concert upload onto the channel and, like, for the archive and I do want, I wanted Escape from the City to be much more dynamic to match the entire vibe of, uh, the concert.

41
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,650
Um, us desyncing there during the MC portion.

42
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:48,510
I'll keep that in.

43
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,850
I'll keep, I'll keep that in.

44
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:52,790
That was pretty sloppy.

45
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,070
Um, okay.

46
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:54,850
Fun fact.

47
00:06:55,130 --> 00:07:02,830
The reason why Laimoo was desynced from us is because Laimoo was like, guys, I have to do the happy birthday part by myself.

48
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:03,970
Like, it's gonna mess with me.

49
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:04,510
Haha.

50
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:17,320
So, we let her, we let her sing happy birthday by herself, but it desynced with her.

51
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:17,740
Haha.

52
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:22,220
Just like, I, I just, I, at that point I was like, I'm not redoing this.

53
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:26,840
I, it's just like, give me, guys, give me a sec.

54
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,760
I'm just singing happy birthday part by myself.

55
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,300
I can't sing it with you guys.

56
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:37,560
So, that's why she's not singed with us.

57
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,680
If you're wondering how the fuck that happened.

58
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:47,780
I'll keep, um, I'll keep, uh, I'll keep the MC portion in.

59
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,420
Um, hahaha.

60
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,940
So, he's just like, what the fuck?

61
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:56,280
Why, you, the sing, you're like, no, I can't.

62
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,380
It's gonna mess with me.

63
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,780
Um, hahaha.

64
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,760
Um, and, yeah, so, yes, love me.

65
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:12,940
So, but yes, there are also like, minor things I would like to fix as well.

66
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,760
Um, you guys might not have noticed it, but like, I know that when it's archived, people are gonna replace it.

67
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,160
And they're gonna play it over and over again.

68
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:25,280
And they're gonna spot all the little mistakes that, like, was like, ah, no, we can't fix this in time.

69
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,980
Because, um, there's not enough time to fix this.

70
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:29,900
And, hahaha.

71
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:37,040
Um, we were telling Mint, count us in when she was the reason everyone was off-tempo.

72
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,240
It's hilarious.

73
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,440
Dogstrings, thank you for the super chat.

74
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,500
Thank you, thank you.

75
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,760
Um, that's why, that's why I was like, ah, no, I have to.

76
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,440
Uh, and there's one thing I really want.

77
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,000
This is like, one of the little things.

78
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:55,640
But, um, one of the things I wanted to change was the light sticks for, um, Escape from the City.

79
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:03,680
I wanted so that when we were singing Escape from the City, I wanted the light sticks to basically light up to our...

80
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,340
Uh, sorry, yeah, my, my glasses hit...

81
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,420
Sorry, my, let me...

82
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,700
To make it more immersive for you guys.

83
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,440
Uh, my glasses, um...

84
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,500
Uh, no wait.

85
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,620
My, my glasses hit my microphone just now.

86
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,480
So...

87
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,540
Anyway, um...

88
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:22,940
You know what?

89
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:23,980
I want...

90
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,380
Oh wait, no.

91
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,340
I don't want to be Dōkittets, sorry.

92
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,100
No Dōkittets for you.

93
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,720
I want tomato time.

94
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,440
So that's why, that's why, uh...

95
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,100
Uh, uh, bu-bub-bub-bub, uh.

96
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:33,780
Okay.

97
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:40,780
So I wanted the light sticks to be the colors of our... of our Oshi... I guess, like, not Oshi, my colors, like, of our colors in general.

98
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:49,320
So, um, that's what I wanted for Escape from the City, but we couldn't change that in time, because, like, it requires them to separate the programming for the 3D stuff.

99
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:54,680
So, I thought it would be a really nice touch to have, like, the light sticks to be, like, our colors.

100
00:09:54,740 --> 00:10:00,080
So, like, you know, each... it's, like, each of our fandom is... each of our fans in our fan commute...

101
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,640
Like, how... are you probably the Doki Bird fandom?

102
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:03,580
But...

103
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,500
So, I thought that was gonna be really cute.

104
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,480
So, it's, like, just, like, some things I really wanted to improve on.

105
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:16,800
And, uh, for, like, you know, I'm a perfectionist, and I just really wanted my concert upload to be, like, really good.

106
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,520
And now you guys sort of know why I was so fucking tired almost every day, and so busy almost every...

107
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,200
It's over.

108
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,640
The evil has been defeated.

109
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,560
It's finally over.

110
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:32,460
Now you guys know why I was so fucking tired every fucking day, and exhausted.

111
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,260
But I...

112
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,820
But I still had to work, because I shall reveal...

113
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:41,520
I shall finally reveal how much this concert cost me.

114
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,840
And then I was... I thought it was very expensive.

115
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,480
But then I was told that, like...

116
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,580
I was, like, on the lower end.

117
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,800
And I was like, that's lower end?

118
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,840
Now you understand why people don't give concerts for free.

119
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:13,040
Why there's, like, streaming tickets and, um, you know, why tickets are so fucking expensive for, like, 3D concerts and everything.

120
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:18,760
Why this is usually, um, why it's usually not free.

121
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,280
So, like, you guys are technically gonna get a free concert.

122
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:28,100
Uh, but to be fair, the production value for mine was pretty high quality, I would say.

123
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:34,040
I would say the production quality was very high quality for, like, what I got.

124
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:38,400
Like, uh, for, like, uh, what I paid for it in general.

125
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:43,720
Um, because, like, I feel like my concert was, like, basically on par with, like...

126
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,680
You can sort of say, like, the quality of...

127
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,640
Even for a month!

128
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,600
If you think about it!

129
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,140
For a month's work?

130
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:53,420
The fact that it was a month's work and, um...

131
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,320
It was able to be, like...

132
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,180
Like, the quality of it was sort of, like, you know...

133
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:01,620
Like, around, like, corporate level was pretty impressive to me.

134
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,620
I was like, holy fuck.

135
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:03,640
Like...

136
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,880
And it was just a month of work from there.

137
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,200
Um...

138
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,960
But, basically...

139
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,580
I shall finally...

140
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,240
Let me...

141
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,480
Let me be Dragoon.

142
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,280
I don't know what to be.

143
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:17,760
Okay, wait.

144
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,320
I got it.

145
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:18,820
Okay, wait.

146
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:19,660
Give me a sec.

147
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,900
I forgot about...

148
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,140
Some people thought I forgot because I did tweet about it.

149
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,180
But, um...

150
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:29,740
I received this before it got tweeted, by the way.

151
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:30,720
Um...

152
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,080
Like, I...

153
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,660
Because they were like, oh, yeah.

154
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:35,580
We just wanted to be sure.

155
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:36,380
Um...

156
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,740
Guys, I knew I knew about this.

157
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,360
Okay, sorry.

158
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,380
Uh...

159
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:39,640
Sorry.

160
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,200
If I'm gonna talk about it, I'll talk about it with this.

161
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,800
Alright, so...

162
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:47,740
Alright.

163
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:49,960
So...

164
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,240
So...

165
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,880
The concert...

166
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,780
The concert...

167
00:12:59,260 --> 00:12:59,660
Was...

168
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,480
Forty-eight thousand dollars.

169
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,460
Jingle jangle.

170
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,360
Jingle...

171
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,260
Jingle...

172
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,680
Jingle jangle.

173
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,000
The funny thing is that I don't know what Chad is reacting to.

174
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,240
It could be for the money or it could be...

175
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:22,600
For...

176
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,420
For the...

177
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,400
Jingle jangle.

178
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,820
Jingle jangle jangle.

179
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,360
Jingle...

180
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,880
Jingle jangle.

181
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,420
I told you.

182
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,500
Sports bra.

183
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,300
Oh, that's right.

184
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,080
My sports bra was working overtime.

185
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,600
Wow, that's a big number.

186
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:43,600
Next thing...

187
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,660
Thank you for the super chat.

188
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:45,200
Thank you.

189
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,020
Thank you.

190
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:46,680
Yes.

191
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:47,740
So...

192
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,380
Um...

193
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:51,220
For those who don't know why they have this...

194
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:56,660
This is actually a birthday present from some of the dragoons.

195
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:59,320
Some of the dragoons...

196
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,400
Uh...

197
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,620
Uh...

198
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,540
Did this as a birthday present for me.

199
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:05,340
So...

200
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:05,540
Uh...

201
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,340
Salia sent it to me.

202
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:06,720
I was like...

203
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,160
Surprise!

204
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,960
The strongest sports bra in the world.

205
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,120
So...

206
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,020
Um...

207
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:18,200
Uh...

208
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,280
Gian, thank you for the super chat.

209
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:19,640
Thank you.

210
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,300
Thank you.

211
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,940
That's a lot of...

212
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:22,660
Money.

213
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,640
The surgery was a success, guys.

214
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,140
Where... Where is she?

215
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,140
I need to... Where's the dragon?

216
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,140
I need to talk to them.

217
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:37,920
No!

218
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,560
Anyway.

219
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,120
But this was a birthday present from the dragoons.

220
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:52,340
They actually contacted my mama and my papa.

221
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:58,640
To, like, basically give... Make sure... Make sure what it's like when I take off my sports bra.

222
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:09,860
So... This is the... The birthday present for me.

223
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:10,760
Nice.

224
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,520
Hey, guys.

225
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,860
Thank you for this super chat.

226
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,260
Thank you.

227
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:18,840
Thank you.

228
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:19,740
So, yes.

229
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,900
This is now my... I can do this now.

230
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,300
I can take off my sports bra.

231
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,660
What if I get demonetized?

232
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,680
I've never had that happen before.

233
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:30,580
I don't know.

234
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,480
Is this demonetized?

235
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,280
Is this demonetizable?

236
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,840
I don't know.

237
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:36,200
Okay.

238
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:36,880
All right.

239
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:37,920
Back to...

240
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,720
Back to... Going back to school now.

241
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,780
We're gonna go back.

242
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,300
We're gonna...

243
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,020
Uh... Can you put on a scarf?

244
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:48,900
Tokey!

245
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,080
Coward!

246
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,540
Anyway.

247
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,380
So, um...

248
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,700
Uh...

249
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,300
So, yes.

250
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,640
Um...

251
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,520
It was...

252
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,060
$48,000.

253
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,560
And...

254
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,160
Um...

255
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,860
And I have to pay more because I'm polishing...

256
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,720
I'm getting, like, stuff redone.

257
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,760
So, it might be, like...

258
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,840
$50,000 later.

259
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,000
Uh...

260
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,760
But...

261
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,020
Uh...

262
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:15,960
Um...

263
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,940
That's why...

264
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,540
Remember when Naimu was like...

265
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,040
So, do you get...

266
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:19,780
Do you get, like...

267
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,660
Do you get anything out of doing this concert?

268
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,260
And I'm like...

269
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,340
Do you get, like, money?

270
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,140
And I'm like...

271
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:24,600
Ha ha ha!

272
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,360
What do you...

273
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,200
What do you mean?

274
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,000
What do you mean?

275
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,060
Ha ha ha ha!

276
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:28,740
You mean...

277
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,100
I lose money.

278
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,740
Ha ha ha ha!

279
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,080
Ha ha ha!

280
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,280
Ha ha ha!

281
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,700
Ha ha ha!

282
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,060
Ha ha ha!

283
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,100
Um...

284
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:37,780
Um...

285
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,580
Full-on American dollars.

286
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,460
Yeehaw!

287
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:41,620
Uh...

288
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,520
Great Googly Moogly 4.

289
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:44,700
Thank you for the super chat.

290
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,120
Thank you.

291
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:45,780
Thank you.

292
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,600
So...

293
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,740
Um...

294
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,360
It was our money, guys.

295
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,060
Because...

296
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,880
Without your support...

297
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,680
I wouldn't have been able...

298
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,840
To, uh...

299
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,100
Do all of this.

300
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,020
And be able to, you know...

301
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:58,680
Do a concert.

302
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,840
Like, this in general.

303
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,120
Um...

304
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:01,780
And...

305
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:01,980
Um...

306
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:02,380
You know...

307
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,500
It was also, like...

308
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,520
A test run...

309
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,840
With this...

310
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,460
Uh...

311
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,960
3D production team.

312
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:08,540
Because...

313
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,100
I will be...

314
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:10,740
Stop...

315
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,560
Stop wasting our money!

316
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,400
Ha ha ha!

317
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,180
Did you not enjoy the concert?

318
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:16,840
You can't say that.

319
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,240
You enjoyed the concert.

320
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,360
The moment you opened that concert...

321
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,520
You can't say that to me.

322
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:22,420
Like...

323
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,540
Ha ha ha ha!

324
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,280
Ha ha ha!

325
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,200
So...

326
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,280
Um...

327
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,100
Anyway...

328
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:28,720
Anyway...

329
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,500
So...

330
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,880
This was a test run...

331
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,280
Because I will be...

332
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,920
Using them for my official...

333
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,540
Um...

334
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,380
3D debut.

335
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,080
I know you guys are, like, saying, like...

336
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,400
Isn't...

337
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,360
Wasn't that your 3D?

338
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,040
No...

339
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,460
That...

340
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:40,600
I...

341
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,400
What I see as an official 3D debut...

342
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,920
Is not just a concert...

343
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,620
It's more like, you know...

344
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,960
More like a...

345
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,000
I guess like...

346
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,120
A...

347
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,600
A show, I guess.

348
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,140
Like...

349
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,660
A celebration of sorts.

350
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:53,740
And...

351
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,120
What I mean by that...

352
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,120
I want to have, like...

353
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,320
More so of not just, like...

354
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:58,560
You know...

355
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,520
Singing and dancing.

356
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:00,400
Um...

357
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,060
I want to, like...

358
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:01,460
You know...

359
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,380
Like, it's like a...

360
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:02,940
Showcase.

361
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:03,240
Yeah.

362
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,340
Showcase variety show type deal.

363
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,400
So it's not just, you know...

364
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,100
Singing and dancing.

365
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,380
So...

366
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:08,920
Um...

367
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,000
More than just a concert.

368
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,260
So, I'll be using them in the future for my official 3D debut.

369
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,540
Because that was, like, the one thing that had the most trouble.

370
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,220
Was trying to find the right 3D studio to do it.

371
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:24,700
And this was, like, my test run with that company.

372
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,460
With their... with their production team.

373
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,740
So, yes, I will be, like, working with them in the future.

374
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:33,580
I don't know.

375
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,780
I feel like it might be much more expensive.

376
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:40,520
Because I want to add more, like, a variety show element.

377
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,140
You know, playing games with people.

378
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,080
Like, you know, like, those little... little, like, games and stuff.

379
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,600
Not just, like, dancing and singing.

380
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,220
And that requires, you know, more setup for things like that.

381
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,300
So, um... but yes, that's what I'm going to be saving up for.

382
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,800
Saving up for next.

383
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,840
In terms of, like, my expenses.

384
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,340
But I'm... I'm gonna chill a little bit.

385
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:01,780
I'm gonna chill.

386
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,840
That was, like... like... a lot.

387
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,520
That was... a lot of money that I spent.

388
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,640
But thank you, guys.

389
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,020
I really appreciate all the super chats and the support.

390
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,360
Like... like I said, without your support.

391
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,840
And without, like, you know, you guys watching me.

392
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:24,060
And, like, um... being here with me.

393
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,800
I couldn't have done this without you guys.

394
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:26,780
Uh, of course.

395
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:27,940
Thank you for the magenta soup.

396
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:28,520
Thank you.

397
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:28,920
Thank you.

398
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:29,560
Ticket fees.

399
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,020
Yeah, like I said, like...

400
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:34,180
Now you guys sort of understand why, like...

401
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:37,000
These concerts are very expensive.

402
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,020
Now...

403
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,580
Now you understand...

404
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,840
Uh, how... why...

405
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,400
Why, like, getting to watch these...

406
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,040
Like, usually, you know, like, official concerts like these...

407
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,040
Um...

408
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:51,800
Uh...

409
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,140
Is, like...

410
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,640
Very expensive with, like...

411
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,020
Even when you have to buy streaming tickets as well.

412
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:57,900
Um...

413
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,280
But...

414
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,800
This concert will be free when I upload it here.

415
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,520
And I'll be adding more stuff to it.

416
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:04,760
Um...

417
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:05,780
Uh...

418
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:06,300
Cooperate.

419
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,300
Thank you for the magenta soup.

420
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:07,940
Thank you.

421
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,320
Thank you.

422
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,020
Ticket fee here.

423
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:09,940
Happy Doki Day.

424
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:10,560
Thank you.

425
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,660
Thank you for the magenta soup.

426
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,540
Thank you.

427
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,160
Thank you.

428
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,000
Uh...

429
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,360
And...

430
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:15,680
But, yes.

431
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,300
But, like...

432
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,300
I was very surprised when they told me that...

433
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,820
When I was, like, comparing notes that, like...

434
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,500
Mine was on the cheaper scale in terms...

435
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,540
Not cheaper, but, like, on the lower end.

436
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,460
Despite the quality of it.

437
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,520
I was...

438
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,940
Very, very surprised.

439
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:31,760
Uh...

440
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,020
Just cause, like, you know...

441
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:33,480
Didn't exp...

442
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:33,840
I...

443
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,440
I thought...

444
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,040
I thought that was very expensive already.

445
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,460
But they're like, no.

446
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:39,720
Um...

447
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,160
Um...

448
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,740
My friend was like, no, they can go to six figures too.

449
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,420
And I was like...

450
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,560
I was like, what?

451
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,420
I was like...

452
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,660
Holy shit!

453
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,880
It's six figures!

454
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,900
And then you can tell why...

455
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,340
People do, like, so much merch shilling.

456
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,840
By the way, buy my merch.

457
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,660
My merch...

458
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:57,940
I...

459
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,060
My merch store is up now.

460
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:00,840
We have a...

461
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,640
Oh my god!

462
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,760
I got the...

463
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,240
Um...

464
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,040
I got the...

465
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,360
Speaking of merch...

466
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,020
Um...

467
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,940
I got the retro Doki Bird plush...

468
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:09,720
Uh...

469
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:09,960
Uh...

470
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,200
Today.

471
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,720
Like, I opened my door today.

472
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:12,440
Um...

473
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,580
After the concert restream.

474
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,560
Um...

475
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,660
And I found...

476
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,400
Like, I got...

477
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,720
I received the box from...

478
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:19,640
Uh...

479
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,580
Gamer Subs...

480
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,920
Of the retro Doki Bird plush.

481
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,300
And it's so cute.

482
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:23,780
Oh...

483
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:26,540
The photos don't do it justice on how cute it is.

484
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,280
And at first, I wanted to edit the hat to make it smaller.

485
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,820
But in person, it's like...

486
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:31,400
It's just...

487
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,800
It looks great in person.

488
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,200
So I asked them to like...

489
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,640
Oh, like the edits and stuff I wanted to do earlier.

490
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,400
Like, it's...

491
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,600
I'm fine with it...

492
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:38,920
Uh...

493
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,520
Being what it is.

494
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,440
So that means like...

495
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,780
The production for it will be done a lot sooner than what it was initially.

496
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:45,640
Um...

497
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,640
Oh, it wasn't 42.

498
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,720
It was 48k.

499
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:48,980
Um...

500
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:49,480
And I had...

501
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:49,760
Uh...

502
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,420
It was 48k.

503
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:52,820
Also...

504
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,820
If there is a country...

505
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,380
Or like a place...

506
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,200
Where...

507
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:57,820
Um...

508
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,260
It...

509
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,060
It says it's not shippable...

510
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,440
Let me know what...

511
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,060
What places they are.

512
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:03,800
Um...

513
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,380
Because...

514
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:04,640
Uh...

515
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,800
I saw someone on Twitter...

516
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,220
It was saying how it wasn't...

517
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:07,920
Like...

518
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,260
Um...

519
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,180
They couldn't buy it from Philippines.

520
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,720
And then I asked...

521
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,300
Um...

522
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,580
I asked like Gamersubs...

523
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,360
And they instantly added it to...

524
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:15,860
Um...

525
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,000
They instantly added...

526
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,840
Uh...

527
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,560
Added it to like shippable countries.

528
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:20,380
Uh...

529
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,420
Or like shippable places.

530
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,420
So...

531
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,660
If you...

532
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,220
Uh...

533
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,080
If there's like...

534
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,400
If you can't buy it...

535
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,160
Let me know...

536
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,520
Where you live...

537
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,620
But not your full address.

538
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,400
Like just...

539
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,460
Brazil...

540
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:35,880
Okay...

541
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,580
Brazil...

542
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:36,840
Alright...

543
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,100
I'll...

544
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,120
I'll say it too.

545
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:38,700
I'll...

546
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,580
Write it in...

547
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,180
I'll write it there.

548
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,300
I'll be like...

549
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:41,740
Ha...

550
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,520
Okay...

551
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,000
Brazil...

552
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,720
Is...

553
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,560
Also...

554
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,940
Not on the list.

555
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,280
I'll write that on right now.

556
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:48,920
So...

557
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,020
If there's any...

558
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:50,480
More...

559
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,900
You can also use like my...

560
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:52,340
Uh...

561
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,200
My tags...

562
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:53,920
My...

563
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,680
I guess like...

564
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,240
I don't know...

565
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:55,760
Do I just...

566
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,780
I guess just complain in Doki Bird Day.

567
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,480
Happy rejecting Doki.

568
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,620
Thank you for the...

569
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,440
Aca, aca, aca.

570
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,180
Super!

571
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,600
Thank you, thank you.

572
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,220
I really appreciate it.

573
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,660
You've been supporting me for so long.

574
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:09,600
Thank you for the...

575
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,080
Aca, aca, aca.

576
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:10,500
Super!

577
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:11,740
Thank you.

578
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:13,860
Um...

579
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:14,480
But yes...

580
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:14,760
Uh...

581
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,380
I guess like...

582
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,760
If I don't see it...

583
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:16,940
Uh...

584
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:19,120
Would be the first time Doki...

585
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,520
Doxed the Fath.

586
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,240
Thank you for the super chat, Alan.

587
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:22,720
Thank you.

588
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,500
Thank you.

589
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,000
Um...

590
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,620
Um...

591
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:25,980
Yeah...

592
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:26,340
But yeah...

593
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,360
Is there's any other places?

594
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,100
Where you're not able to order it from wherever you are.

595
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:39,200
Just let me know and then I'll let the GamerStuffs people know as well.

596
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,720
And then they'll fix that.

597
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:41,400
Oh yeah!

598
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,720
Behind the scenes stuff.

599
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:46,980
Okay, so... But yes, thank you again for all the support.

600
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:53,180
Like all the money you guys are super chatting right now is going towards... You know, recuperating.

601
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:57,280
It's going towards recuperating the amount I spent for...

602
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,240
The Anime Expo concert.

603
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,820
And also going towards my 3D debut.

604
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,080
Digi!

605
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,120
Thank you for the super chat.

606
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,160
Thank you for Magenta.

607
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:07,580
Super!

608
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:08,540
Thank you!

609
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,100
Thank you!

610
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:09,860
I really appreciate it!

611
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,320
Merch is also a great way to support me as well.

612
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:19,440
That's why I like... I would say like... Merch is also a great way to support me as well.

613
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:24,080
Because I get a huge cut from the merch as an indie.

614
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,260
So it is also a great way to support...

615
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:27,680
Support me.

616
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,360
And, you know, you get something in return as well.

617
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,780
So, like, you get something, I get something, which is money.

618
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:37,340
Okay.

619
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:51,480
Um, there's no... I believe... I believe the only FOMO drops are... Actually, I'll ask about, like, which one is, like, FOMO items and which one isn't.

620
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:57,560
Because, like, there are some items that are gonna be there forever, and there's some that might not be there forever.

621
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,040
It depends.

622
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,300
I don't... I'm not that sure.

623
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:02,220
Because my staff actually handled all the merch stuff.

624
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:05,860
All I did was handling... All I did was handle the creative side of it.

625
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:10,560
Like, people I wanted to work with to do stuff like this.

626
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,700
Like, you know, like the artwork.

627
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,560
I chose the artist for all the things I wanted to work on.

628
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:18,160
Um, Billy, thank you for the aca, aca, aca, aca soup.

629
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,000
Ah, thank you, thank you.

630
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,680
Um, here's my address.

631
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,280
I live an hour from the tomato restaurant, HK.

632
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:25,660
Happy DNA.

633
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,240
And here's my concert ticket.

634
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,600
Oh, is Hong Kong not that there?

635
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,660
Don't worry, I'll write it there.

636
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:35,080
Hong Kong is also not on the list.

637
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:35,960
Okay, there you go.

638
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,600
I wrote that down there too.

639
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,180
Don't worry, I got you.

640
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,520
I got you.

641
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:43,360
Um, thank you guys.

642
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:43,760
Okay.

643
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:45,880
What else?

644
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,320
Wait, what was I talking about?

645
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,520
Oh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

646
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,000
What was I talking about?

647
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,080
Oh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

648
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,180
I don't remember.

649
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,360
Oh, it is?

650
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:03,160
Oh, I thought you were like, I'm gonna dox myself by telling you what currency it is.

651
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,420
Okay, then I deleted it.

652
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,260
They don't know.

653
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,520
They don't know.

654
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,120
Don't worry.

655
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,940
Your mistake stays here.

656
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,540
Oh, I can't wait to eat my cake.

657
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,660
Oh, look at this cake, too.

658
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:19,880
Look at this dragon.

659
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:20,740
I can't wait to eat you.

660
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,840
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

661
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:27,980
Thanks for the show.

662
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,900
Love to see the sloppy sisters on stage.

663
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:30,600
Thank you.

664
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,480
Thank you for the super chat.

665
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,280
Thank you.

666
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:32,980
Thank you.

667
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:37,200
Um, I, uh, uh, also, yeah, thank you for the super chat.

668
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:37,500
Thank you.

669
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:37,900
Thank you.

670
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,300
I'm new to this Kamioshi thing.

671
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,800
And I've already spent $200 at the AX and stream praying for the meet and greet.

672
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,760
Great to see another bird online.

673
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:45,860
Thank you.

674
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:46,680
Thank you for the super chat.

675
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,920
I'm happy to be your new Kamioshi.

676
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,260
I really am.

677
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,100
Thank you.

678
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:52,560
And good luck.

679
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,580
Good luck to you.

680
00:26:54,040 --> 00:27:02,140
Uh, can you please do glasses, tired eyes, blushing, and no sports bra.

681
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:05,540
Uh, that is so specific, Mantis.

682
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,100
Oh, are you Jesus, though?

683
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:12,940
The only one that can ask me this is Jesus H.

684
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:13,480
Christ.

685
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,620
I'm sorry.

686
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,100
I don't do it for, for false prophets.

687
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:27,660
I gotta get Jesus in here if you want it.

688
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,640
Um, oh my gosh, I do love my new outfit, too.

689
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:38,380
Oh, it's gonna be so hard to choose, um, between, like, what do I feel like today.

690
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:44,480
And I, there's so many new outfits that, I have, like, so many new outfits cooking in my brain right now.

691
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:52,900
Um, um, I, you know, like, back then, like, I've always wanted, oh my gosh, like, this is, like, my dream.

692
00:27:52,900 --> 00:28:14,100
I don't know if you guys know this, but, um, before, um, uh, before, like, uh, when I was still a Doki bird, like, I guess, like, four to five years ago, um, um, my, my thing was that I wanted to, like, have so many different outfits and different, like,

693
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,300
skin suits as well.

694
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:21,640
This was even, I, I, I, Bark Nights will remember this.

695
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:29,320
I had this idea before it was, like, an Iron Mouse thing, where, like, you know how she has, like, different skin suits from different artists?

696
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:34,000
I was planning on doing that, like, before she did that.

697
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:41,880
And actually was about to, was about, like, was talking about my plans and my Bark Nights, like, I think, like, what, six to seven years ago?

698
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:47,700
And, um, and, uh, I don't remember, like, it was, like, 67 years ago.

699
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,400
I talked about this to my Bark Nights.

700
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:55,460
I really, I was saving, I wanted to do that as, like, to collect, like, different skin suits from different artists.

701
00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:11,240
Um, and then, like, I was actually, uh, was going to do that because I had a, if you guys looked at my old, uh, my old very first graduation video, um, I had, I had one prepared.

702
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,760
Like, and it was going to be, like, the start.

703
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:25,040
Like, it was, it was going to be, like, the start of, like, having different skin suits by different artists and just collecting different styles and everything.

704
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:30,280
Um, and, like, I was about to do it and then, like, I disappeared.

705
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:36,060
And then, and now, and now I'm back.

706
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:39,100
And now, now I'm just, I just collect outfits.

707
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:46,980
Uh, but, like, now it's a little harder to do something like it because, like, back then, VTubing was a lot newer.

708
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:56,820
So, like, there was no, there wasn't really, like, branding-wise regarding, like, uh, uh, different, like, you know, branding-wise was, like, more unclear.

709
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:04,840
But, obviously, I don't do, I don't, I'm not going to do that now because, like, you know, I have my brand, which is, like, this, I guess.

710
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:09,560
Like, I have, like, a brand now.

711
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:20,520
Um, but, so, uh, so, like, basically, uh, instead of, like, collecting different skin suits, I collect, well, to be fair, I do collect different skin suits, but they're more, like, shitpost.

712
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:27,640
They're more, like, sorry, oh, my God, it's just, like, I'm so funny.

713
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:29,860
Sorry.

714
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:33,120
Oh, my God, guys, I'm so fucking funny to myself.

715
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:47,000
Um, anyway, um, oh, my God, um, they're more, like, shitpost, like, shitpost skin suits when I do, like, for different artists.

716
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:55,580
Um, but now I just collect, like, different outfits, and, like, now I just do different outfits because, like, I don't know, branding-wise, it's just easier.

717
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:03,860
Um, because I think, like, back then, I have an excuse for being, like, well, I'm just a, I'm just a small VTuber, I'm just a small, like, just a small fish show.

718
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:08,500
I don't really have a brand, so I just want to, you know, like, because I love art.

719
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,440
I love art in general.

720
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:20,140
And I used to commission so many different artists and supported a lot of different artists before I was here.

721
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:24,720
And now it's really crazy to see a lot of people draw me for free.

722
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:27,280
Because I was never used to that back then.

723
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,640
I basically love collecting art.

724
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:36,180
I love collecting art and I used to commission so many different artists for artwork for me.

725
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:45,000
And because of that, I was like, oh, I want to collect VTuber skin suits too.

726
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,680
That was another thing I thought about collecting.

727
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:51,740
Because I have an unhealthy obsession with collecting things.

728
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,620
Depending on what I zero in.

729
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:58,540
And back then, I was thinking about collecting skin suits.

730
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,900
That sounded so wrong.

731
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,180
I'm gonna skin you.

732
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,840
I gotta catch my...

733
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,000
Actually, like...

734
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,400
Back then, I contacted like two to three artists.

735
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,980
For like, regarding like potential like...

736
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:22,400
VTuber skin suits and stuff too.

737
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,320
So, yeah.

738
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,680
It's pretty crazy to think about.

739
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,120
Like, that was something I was actually planning.

740
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,900
But now I just want to make very different...

741
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:28,640
Lots of different outfits.

742
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,100
For different themes and stuff like that.

743
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:32,780
Um...

744
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:33,680
Oh my gosh.

745
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,420
I can't leak it to you guys yet.

746
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,660
About like, what kind...

747
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,800
What kind of outfits I'm gonna get in the future.

748
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,280
But I think on...

749
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,120
In 2026, I do want...

750
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:46,100
To host another outfit contest in the future.

751
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,080
Um...

752
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,120
Because I love the stuff you guys designed for me.

753
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,480
And like, I would love to like...

754
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,220
Um...

755
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:52,900
You know...

756
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:53,240
Uh...

757
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,780
Make some of your outfits into like, reality too.

758
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:56,540
So...

759
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,780
Right now, I can't do it now.

760
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,080
Because I actually have like...

761
00:32:59,080 --> 00:32:59,480
Several...

762
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,060
Like...

763
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,660
Two outfits queued up at the moment.

764
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:02,520
Hahahaha!

765
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:04,360
Hahahaha!

766
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:04,900
Hahahaha!

767
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:05,720
Hahahaha!

768
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:09,420
So like, I wanna get that over with before...

769
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,240
Um...

770
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,300
Before like...

771
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,200
Uh...

772
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,360
Um...

773
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,920
Like, doing an outfit contest.

774
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:15,740
But thank you!

775
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,120
Hey!

776
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,480
Thank you for the Akasupa.

777
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,960
Thank you, thank you.

778
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,380
Happy birthday, Doki.

779
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,620
You always spoil us so much.

780
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,140
Also, you dropped the tomato beanie.

781
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,800
Yeah, my soul is yours.

782
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,440
Thank you for the Akasupa.

783
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,820
Thank you, thank you.

784
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:32,200
Yes, I have two more outfits queued up.

785
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:38,200
Okay, what if I just reveal to you guys the next outfit?

786
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,580
No, actually, no, I'll fundraise for that.

787
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,560
I'm a businesswoman.

788
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,880
I know, okay.

789
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,580
Alright, let me... I'll set up a goal.

790
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,260
Let's see.

791
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,080
Okay.

792
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:57,280
I'll set up... I'll set up a goal.

793
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,080
Alright.

794
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:02,420
Oh, it has to be like... Okay, 50.

795
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:07,440
Okay, we'll do... Orange or higher?

796
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:08,080
Okay.

797
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,840
I'll make it...

798
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:11,240
One hour.

799
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,900
I'll reveal...

800
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,680
Reveal the next...

801
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,780
Because I don't have the next skin suit theme.

802
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,840
It's only... It's just business.

803
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:30,660
Guys, do you want the 3D debut sooner?

804
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:32,900
You can't keep getting away.

805
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:33,520
You can't keep getting away.

806
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,180
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

807
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,540
Buy my silence!

808
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:38,960
Right now!

809
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:40,660
You can...

810
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,040
You can't buy my silence!

811
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,100
Alright.

812
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,320
Wait, no.

813
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,780
You can't...

814
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:47,820
Ha ha ha.

815
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:48,980
Ha ha.

816
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:49,620
Buy for me.

817
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:50,220
This is...

818
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:51,280
Oh, it's an extortion!

819
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:57,360
You either don't know what the next theme is or if you're very curious and you want to get spoiled, right?

820
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:00,880
This is for people who want to get spoiled right now.

821
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:11,800
Bribery.

822
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:17,040
Yes, if you want to bribe me right now, you can.

823
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:26,540
I have no idea.

824
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:30,660
My mama wrote that date down, and I did not ask any questions.

825
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,000
I actually... I don't know.

826
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,620
She wrote that down, and I didn't ask.

827
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,980
I was just like, cool.

828
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,080
Pay to win.

829
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:42,720
Yes, okay.

830
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,200
But those who were like...

831
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:44,480
All right.

832
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,960
I know this is like...

833
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,820
It kills your... Okay, I won't kill your immersion.

834
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,100
I'll do this.

835
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:50,760
Okay.

836
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,920
So, for those who are like...

837
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,600
What the fuck does this say?

838
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:57,740
Um...

839
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:00,360
Or like wondering, like, what does this mean?

840
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,080
I don't know.

841
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,220
I honestly don't know.

842
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,920
I just...

843
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,340
I was just like, oh, well, we'll keep it there.

844
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,260
I don't know.

845
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:17,500
It might be special to my mama, but I have no idea what the date mean.

846
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:18,280
Okay.

847
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,280
How about accept my breath?

848
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,000
But...

849
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,420
That's basically...

850
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,020
Um...

851
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:30,520
I don't know.

852
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:31,260
April...

853
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:31,800
I don't...

854
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,040
What happened on April 1st, two...

855
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,380
2004, mama?

856
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,600
What happened then?

857
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,040
Okay.

858
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,540
I want to take down my hoodie.

859
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,920
What happened then?

860
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,160
I don't know.

861
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,760
There's so many combinations, dude.

862
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:47,300
That's the thing.

863
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,000
That's the thing.

864
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:48,760
Like...

865
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,020
I...

866
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:51,980
It's gonna be so difficult to like...

867
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,000
Choose...

868
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:54,580
Uh...

869
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,540
Choose like...

870
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,240
Um...

871
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:57,480
Um...

872
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:58,900
What to use?

873
00:36:59,060 --> 00:36:59,740
Because it's all...

874
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:00,900
Like, you know, I have summer...

875
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,500
I have the beach episode now.

876
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,520
And I have school episode.

877
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,040
And then, um...

878
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,920
I have, you know, my bounty western themed and everything.

879
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,220
So it's gonna be like...

880
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,480
Super difficult to...

881
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,980
Figure out which one to use for your streams these days.

882
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,360
Um...

883
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:16,840
Oh my gosh.

884
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:17,240
So much.

885
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,120
I love all the variety.

886
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:18,940
I love variety.

887
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,800
Like, right now, I'm like...

888
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,620
Um...

889
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,000
Back then, like...

890
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,380
It was very difficult to like...

891
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:26,520
Uh...

892
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,740
There was a limit to like...

893
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,280
How...

894
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,840
What you can do...

895
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,580
And stuff.

896
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:32,500
Uh...

897
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,120
So like...

898
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,040
We had a limit on like...

899
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:35,580
You know...

900
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:36,460
What toggle...

901
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:38,240
Like, the amount of toggles we have.

902
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,320
And especially like...

903
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,540
If it's a complicated thing that we want...

904
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,580
It limits like...

905
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:43,860
The amount of toggles and stuff.

906
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:44,820
But now...

907
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,040
Since I'm an indie...

908
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:46,840
I was like...

909
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,580
I want this.

910
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:47,920
I want...

911
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,020
I don't have to like...

912
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:49,580
Pick, you know?

913
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,400
I could be like...

914
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,300
I want this!

915
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,260
And then I also want this!

916
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:54,200
And I want...

917
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,040
Because it's my money.

918
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:55,620
Like...

919
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:56,580
Like...

920
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,940
It's my money.

921
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:58,540
Even like...

922
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:58,700
You know...

923
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:58,980
I'd be like...

924
00:37:58,980 --> 00:37:59,720
Oh, I can't pay extra.

925
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,280
Like...

926
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,160
Oh...

927
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:01,480
Um...

928
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,040
They're like...

929
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,440
No, you have this limit.

930
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,140
And I was like...

931
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:04,260
Okay.

932
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,420
But now I'm like...

933
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,160
This is my money!

934
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:08,800
I...

935
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,860
I want this!

936
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,380
And I want that!

937
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:12,140
And I...

938
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,700
I want to have...

939
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,780
This combination too!

940
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,440
I'm greedy!

941
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:24,920
I want this!

942
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,460
Welcome to Tomato Farm!

943
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:27,140
Welcome!

944
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,240
Because I'm like...

945
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:28,880
That looks cool!

946
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,940
I think I wanted so many things!

947
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,280
And it's why...

948
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:32,660
Like...

949
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:35,520
My mama forgot about the...

950
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:35,880
Like...

951
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,600
She did...

952
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,760
She said she finished it!

953
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:38,580
I think she just...

954
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,600
She just forgot to send it to me!

955
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:41,700
And...

956
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,500
Um...

957
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,120
And then like...

958
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,000
I didn't realize it!

959
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,000
Because I was so busy!

960
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:45,580
Like, you know?

961
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:46,900
Like, I didn't check the file or anything!

962
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:47,900
I just assumed...

963
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,040
Like, everything was there!

964
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:49,880
Um...

965
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,580
Because there were so many things I asked for!

966
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,140
You know?

967
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:52,620
Like...

968
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:53,960
Like, even for the beach episode!

969
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:54,900
There was a lot of stuff too!

970
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:55,440
Like, you know?

971
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,140
Like, I have this...

972
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:57,940
Sorry, you don't see...

973
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,340
Like, sorry!

974
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,140
He's like a little short!

975
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,900
The greed never stops!

976
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,960
Can the next outfit be considered...

977
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,600
A tax write-up!

978
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,240
Uh...

979
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,280
Robin, thank you for the super chat!

980
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:11,880
Thank you, thank you!

981
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,200
And here's the second one to make up!

982
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,340
And the other one!

983
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:15,580
But...

984
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,240
Uh...

985
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:16,780
He's...

986
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,260
Sorry!

987
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:17,920
He's a little...

988
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,940
He's a short king too!

989
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,460
Mr. Class President!

990
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,260
Ha ha ha ha!

991
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,620
Ha ha ha ha!

992
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,420
Ha ha ha ha!

993
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,160
No, thank you for the super chat!

994
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,140
Thank you guys!

995
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,480
Thank you guys so much for the support!

996
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:32,420
I...

997
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,140
I really mean it, guys!

998
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,100
Thank you all so much!

999
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:36,940
Ha ha ha!

1000
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,060
Thank you, everybody!

1001
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,320
Um...

1002
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,020
And as someone was saying, like...

1003
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:41,720
Um...

1004
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,520
But yes, I do love investing...

1005
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,360
Reinvesting into my own channel!

1006
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,980
Because like, like I said, I don't know why I'm gonna fall off.

1007
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:52,020
So I'm taking advantage of this, like, as much as I can to like...

1008
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,640
Also that, you know, because like...

1009
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:58,020
I feel like VTubing, I don't know if I could do this for like 10 more years or anything.

1010
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:58,620
I don't know.

1011
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:02,160
But like, um, I think like, not just like VTubing, but streaming career.

1012
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:05,620
I always say this before, but streaming career tends to be like a really...

1013
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:09,540
Unless you're like one of the big ones, I guess.

1014
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:14,880
Like, um, the ones that like, are like super fucking big and everything.

1015
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:19,260
Um, for me, like, uh...

1016
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:22,040
Um, I don't know.

1017
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,660
Like, whatever I'm gonna fall off.

1018
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:29,000
So I'm taking advantage of doing all these fun things I can with the funding that I have as much as I can.

1019
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:33,060
And doing all these like fun investments into my channel and into you guys.

1020
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,760
And like, letting you guys have a great time with me and stuff.

1021
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:36,660
So thank you again.

1022
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:37,940
Thank you everyone.

1023
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,160
I really appreciate it.

1024
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:43,320
And thank you for spending, um, your time with me on my birthday.

1025
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:43,480
Yay!

1026
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:47,680
Because I feel like, you know, if you guys weren't here, I'd be spending it alone.

1027
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,940
So, I really appreciate it, guys.

1028
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:53,180
Um, for you guys all being here.

1029
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,000
Because I would have been like spending my birthday alone.

1030
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,120
And I wouldn't have been doing anything special at all.

1031
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,500
Just, just go on my day.

1032
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,380
But I had a whole day planned for you guys.

1033
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,860
A whole day with... together.

1034
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:06,420
Yay!

1035
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:08,280
Oh yeah.

1036
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:09,540
I'll just drop this right now.

1037
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,320
Next week, I'm doing a collab with Nimi, Doobie, and Mint.

1038
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,620
I'll reveal it on my birthday.

1039
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,100
What?

1040
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:24,820
What?

1041
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,400
Yep.

1042
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,600
I organized a...

1043
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,020
Um...

1044
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:33,060
I organized a collab with, um...

1045
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:36,100
Uh, Nimi, Doobie, and Mint for next week.

1046
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,300
And, uh, we're gonna be playing Emissionary Zero.

1047
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:40,980
Uh, next week.

1048
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:42,340
Um...

1049
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:44,540
Uh, we were like discussing about games and stuff.

1050
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,360
And I brought up Emissionary Zero because it looked like a really fun game.

1051
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,760
Because it was also for...

1052
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,120
Also, we're like...

1053
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,680
For those who are wondering, oh, what about Peak?

1054
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,640
Because I know a lot of people are like, when are you playing Peak?

1055
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:58,260
Um, we're playing Peak the week after that with the Sloppy Sisters.

1056
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,160
Uh, so...

1057
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:00,680
That's why...

1058
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,960
That's why, like...

1059
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,280
Um, we never, like, really brought it up.

1060
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:06,280
Like, you know, obviously, um...

1061
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,840
People were wondering, when am I playing Peak?

1062
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:10,860
Um, we're playing that with the Sloppy Sisters the week after that.

1063
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:11,540
Like...

1064
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:17,600
So yeah, here.

1065
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:21,760
Here's a little drop of knowledge for the schedule.

1066
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,060
I'm bringing back collabs again.

1067
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,460
Like I said, now it's more chill time.

1068
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:33,900
I do a lot of solo streams the last couple of weeks and months.

1069
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:37,840
It's because I've been so fucking busy that it's very hard to organize collabs.

1070
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:43,360
Because usually I'm the one, for collabs, I'm the one that reaches out to people.

1071
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,560
And when I'm very busy, I don't reach out to people.

1072
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,800
That's basically it.

1073
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,220
So that's why there was a huge lack of collabs.

1074
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:56,680
Because usually, I feel like VTubers are just a very introverted group of people.

1075
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:02,680
So unless they get invited to, a lot of them tend to do solo content because of that.

1076
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:06,240
And because I've been very busy, I haven't been reaching out to people.

1077
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:11,400
Like even the Chibi Doki collab, like I was the one that I organized that and stuff.

1078
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:15,900
So unless you're like an extrovert or like, I'm not an extrovert by the way.

1079
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:22,200
I just like, I just like, I like doing collabs, but like I'm not an extrovert.

1080
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:28,140
But I also like, but that also requires me to like, I like doing the, I like doing the collabs.

1081
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:29,680
Organizing it is hard.

1082
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:37,940
Also, like, I feel like asking things is like, not that difficult to do.

1083
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:41,100
Because like, I don't know, I guess I'm shameless.

1084
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:46,060
Like, because like, I'm so used to like, asking people and stuff.

1085
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,500
Because like, my mindset is like, the worst they can say is no.

1086
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,960
And if they say no, then you're like, alright, whatever.

1087
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:56,040
Like, I'm not, like, I get sad, yeah.

1088
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:58,100
Like, I get sad and overrejection.

1089
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:01,500
But like, it's all about taking a shot, you know?

1090
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:02,900
Like, it's just a 50-50.

1091
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:03,780
So, yeah.

1092
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:07,580
So, yeah, I'm looking forward to next week's collabs.

1093
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,780
And then the week after that collab.

1094
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,220
And then I don't know what the next collab is after that.

1095
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:11,720
I...

1096
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:13,880
Yeah.

1097
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:16,540
Oh, shit, we reached the goal.

1098
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:17,180
Nice.

1099
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,420
Okay, you guys bought my, you guys bribed me.

1100
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:20,880
Alright, are you guys ready?

1101
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:25,500
To know what the next outfit, outfit theme is?

1102
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:26,500
It is.

1103
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:27,440
Whoa.

1104
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:28,640
Alright, take a guess though.

1105
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:29,280
Wait, guess.

1106
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,100
I want you guys to get, I want you to see what you guys guessed first.

1107
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:33,280
Before I reveal it.

1108
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,000
Congratulations, dragons!

1109
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:39,080
Yay!

1110
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:41,720
Congratulations!

1111
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:44,300
Whoa!

1112
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:47,580
You did it!

1113
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:49,300
You bribed me.

1114
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:50,680
Successfully.

1115
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:52,160
Let's go!

1116
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:56,860
Alright.

1117
00:44:58,680 --> 00:44:59,860
Oh, one person.

1118
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,760
I saw at least one person that got it right.

1119
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:03,040
That got the theme right.

1120
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:04,740
But which one is it?

1121
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,720
Alright, so...

1122
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:10,680
Alright, so the next theme...

1123
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:11,400
Or...

1124
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,380
I won't reveal...

1125
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:14,320
Like, the design's done.

1126
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:15,600
But like...

1127
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,860
The design's done.

1128
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:19,060
The skin suit isn't.

1129
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:19,900
The design is.

1130
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:20,820
Um...

1131
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:23,720
This design is also not designed by my mama.

1132
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:25,040
Um...

1133
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:25,320
Uh...

1134
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,120
I...

1135
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:26,900
Uh...

1136
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:27,740
I...

1137
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:28,060
Uh...

1138
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:30,920
Commissioned someone else to do the design for it.

1139
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:31,460
Um...

1140
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:32,260
You'll understand why?

1141
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,300
During the actual stream for it.

1142
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:35,180
Whenever that's...

1143
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:35,640
That is.

1144
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,960
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

1145
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:39,080
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1146
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:40,700
Um...

1147
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:40,880
Um...

1148
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:41,100
But...

1149
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:43,520
The next outfit theme is...

1150
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:45,280
Um...

1151
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,320
Is sleepwear.

1152
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:47,800
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1153
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:48,920
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1154
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:49,080
Uh...

1155
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:49,780
For...

1156
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:50,920
Good Night Dragoons.

1157
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:51,320
Cause...

1158
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,880
It was inspired by...

1159
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:53,900
Good Night Dragoons.

1160
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:54,980
And I will say...

1161
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:56,220
The sleepwear...

1162
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:56,760
is...

1163
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:57,140
Is...

1164
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:57,620
Is...

1165
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:58,160
A lot...

1166
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,000
More...

1167
00:45:59,000 --> 00:45:59,780
Feminine.

1168
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:00,900
That's all I'll say.

1169
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:01,640
Oh...

1170
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,140
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1171
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:06,560
It's a...

1172
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,420
More...

1173
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:08,460
Feminine...

1174
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:08,820
Design.

1175
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,160
So...

1176
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,280
Um, that's all I'll say about the next outfit.

1177
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,120
I don't know when it'll be done, though.

1178
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,180
I don't know when it'll be done.

1179
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:17,580
I only have the design of it.

1180
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:40,140
Um... What if you could bribe... Unless someone wants to bribe me... Unless someone wants to bribe me... I won't say much, but if someone slides something over...

1181
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:44,220
I may be... I may... I won't say much.

1182
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:49,280
No, she can't keep getting away with it.

1183
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,400
Name your price.

1184
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:53,960
Okay.

1185
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:57,340
Thank you for the super chat.

1186
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:57,820
Thank you.

1187
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:58,420
Thank you.

1188
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,360
You're a female.

1189
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:01,280
Okay.

1190
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:05,320
$20 is $20.

1191
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,520
Jesus, we need you.

1192
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,780
Who the... When we need him the most, he's disappears.

1193
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:14,680
Alright.

1194
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:19,680
Anyway, I'll talk about... Um, the behind the scene... The scene stuff.

1195
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:24,420
Um... Speaking of concerts... I'm gonna talk about the behind the scenes stuff.

1196
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,420
Um... For... Um... For the... For the concert.

1197
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:30,200
So, okay.

1198
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:34,400
I love... I love the giant ass dragoon that dances with me.

1199
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:36,900
Because it reminds me... Like, I said this before...

1200
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:39,980
But it reminded me of the... Katy Perry.

1201
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,860
This is between you and me.

1202
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:44,920
On the black fire.

1203
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:46,360
Thank you for the super chat.

1204
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:46,780
Thank you.

1205
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:47,340
Thank you.

1206
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:50,600
Jesus died for the sports bra to come up.

1207
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:51,660
Jay, thank you for the super chat.

1208
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:51,960
Thank you.

1209
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:52,560
Thank you.

1210
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:55,620
Scott, are you one of the good females?

1211
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,040
Thank you for the super chat.

1212
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:57,340
Thank you.

1213
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:57,880
Thank you.

1214
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,080
Kaz, thank you for the super chat.

1215
00:47:59,160 --> 00:47:59,380
Thank you.

1216
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:00,000
Thank you.

1217
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:03,420
Five dokelion doublooms under the table for you.

1218
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:03,720
Okay.

1219
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:04,940
So, I love it.

1220
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:06,660
Because it reminded me of Left Shark.

1221
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:09,060
From the Katy Perry concert.

1222
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:13,060
And, like, I... Like, because at first, we were like, is this size okay?

1223
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,000
Or do you want me... us to, like, make it smaller?

1224
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,860
And I was like, no, this is, like, perfect.

1225
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:22,040
I was just like, no, this is actually so... It's so fucking stupid.

1226
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:22,620
I love it.

1227
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:27,900
Mr. Broken Bond, thank you to the Akasupa.

1228
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:28,820
Thank you, thank you.

1229
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:31,040
Here is your bribe, Toki.

1230
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:32,560
Oh, thank you for the super chat.

1231
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:33,360
Thank you, thank you.

1232
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:36,140
A maid, a nurse, a train conductor, and a bounty hunter.

1233
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:37,580
What do all of these have in common?

1234
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,560
Well, you can find them all taking a break at a saloon.

1235
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:41,860
Thank you for the super chat.

1236
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,100
Thank you, thank you.

Um, alright, I'll show you guys.

Okay.

1239
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:49,440
Some of you guys were like, I have a special treat for you guys.

1240
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:52,300
Um, regarding Left Dragoon.

1241
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:54,440
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

For... for Left Dragoon.

1244
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:02,980
I think this is the right one.

1245
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:03,940
Let me double check.

1246
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:06,860
Um, yeah, this is... Okay.

1247
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:07,940

1248
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:16,600

A real person is there.

00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,920
A real person is there.

1256
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:29,960

00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:13,980
Whoa.

1262
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:18,760
Look at this.

Look at this.

1264
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:21,800
Needle legs go.

1265
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,280
That's for our entertainment.

1266
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,760
No, there is a real person in there.

1267
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:29,940
That's a real fucking person.

1268
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:33,740
Lord, thank you for the super chat.

1269
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:34,080
Thank you.

1270
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:34,700
Thank you.

1271
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,120
Great concert, Toki.

1272
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,600
I hope I can watch more of your live streams in the future.

1273
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,020
And now that I've been watching more of your videos.

1274
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:41,800
Thank you.

1275
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:42,840
Thank you for the super chat.

1276
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:43,300
Thank you.

1277
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:44,120
Thank you.

1278
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:47,100
The legs are so expressive.

1279
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,700
Wink if you need help.

1280
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:57,360
Yeah.

1281
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:58,880
Left Dragoon.

1282
00:50:59,200 --> 00:50:59,340
Go.

1283
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:01,780
Yeah.

1284
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:02,600
Yeah, baby.

1285
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:11,020
But yes, I wanted to show you guys this.

1286
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:13,200
Also, I guess I could show you guys this one.

1287
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:15,440
Okay, so Party Rock originally.

1288
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:20,180
Okay, so also dad was originally going to...

1289
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:26,140
Um, this was a scrapped, uh, one of our scrapped, uh, choreos for this.

1290
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:28,900
Um, so we're...

1291
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:30,300
Shuffling is really hard.

1292
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:32,520
Um,

1293
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:39,800
we had, uh... Oh yeah, that was another thing I wanted to polish.

1294
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:45,020
Cause dad was supposed to be on me during like the last MC portion.

1295
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:52,560
Like he was supposed to like appear during the last MC portion, but like, um, he wasn't there.

1296
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:53,820
So I want to add that in.

1297
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:55,120
Cause you know, I wanted him to be there.

1298
00:51:55,320 --> 00:52:00,740
Um, but obviously I didn't want him to dance with me because like, so the dance moves were like, you know, fucked up.

1299
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:10,260
But we had like, so this was like a scrapped, uh, where was it?

1300
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:12,040
Okay.

1301
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:16,380
This was like scrapped basically of like the choreo.

1302
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:24,380
We changed the choreo after I was like, I was like talking to one of my friends about it.

1303
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,760
And they're like, no, you have to add the shuffle.

1304
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:30,420
Like that's like so iconic, but like shuffling is so fucking hard.

1305
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:31,860
So like, I'll show you guys.

1306
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:32,960
So that.

1307
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:38,860
I was like, I don't want to do the shuffle.

1308
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:43,080
So, so I was just like, okay.

1309
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:43,880
Okay.

1310
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,020
Every day is shuffling.

1311
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:48,660
Yeah.

1312
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:49,960
I'm shuffling.

1313
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:50,440
Whoa.

1314
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:53,840
Yeah.

1315
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:56,800
I'm shuffling.

1316
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:58,320
Let's go.

1317
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:08,160
So, um, I, I, I, I was just like, okay.

1318
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:12,020
And then my friend was like, no, you have to do the shuffle.

1319
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:13,280
I, I, oh my God.

1320
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:13,780
Shuffling.

1321
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:14,020
Sorry.

1322
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:14,520
Uh,

1323
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:27,200
um, so, um, that's why I like, we, it was changed, but I wanted to show that to you guys.

1324
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:32,620
So like, just so you guys know what it was supposed to look like before we went back to shuffle it.

1325
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,820
Uh, um, man, thank you for the super chat.

1326
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:37,100
Thank you.

1327
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:37,600
Thank you.

1328
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:42,120
I discovered you a couple of days ago and I just wanted to stop by and wish you a happy birthday.

1329
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:42,360
Yay!

1330
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:44,120
Hope you enjoyed your special day.

1331
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:44,920
Thank you!

1332
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,160
Thank you for the super chat.

1333
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:47,120
Thank you.

1334
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:48,640
I really appreciate it, guys.

1335
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:51,760
Thank you so much for the support, everybody, and for the super chats.

1336
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,960
I really do appreciate it, everyone.

1337
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:57,660
And like I said, I really enjoyed spending my birthday with all of you guys.

1338
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,520
Alright, more behind-the-scenes stuff that I can show you guys.

1339
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:02,540
Okay.

1340
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:05,960
Where is it?

1341
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,500
I like...

1342
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:12,960
Where is it?

1343
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:13,900
Behind-the-scenes.

1344
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:14,720
Oh, yeah.

1345
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,080
Also, my neck was broken.

1346
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:20,680
We fixed this.

1347
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:23,280
It was bad.

1348
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:31,020
Yeah, so my neck was gonna be broken, and I was just like, oh, that's not good.

1349
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:32,140
That's not good!

1350
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:38,340
So, thankfully, we fixed that in time.

1351
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,100
Also, like, this was the...

1352
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:40,960
Okay, so...

1353
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:47,680
Originally, the sunglasses were like this, but I was just like, I don't like that.

1354
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,780
Like, I don't know.

1355
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:51,120
It felt... I don't know.

1356
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:52,020
I wanted...

1357
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:56,740
You know, it was already a shitpost, but, like, I wanted to make it, like, a serious shitpost.

1358
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:57,780
So...

1359
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:00,460
So...

1360
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:04,560
So, the glasses were originally...

1361
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:06,740
Uh, yeah, that was, like, a bit too meme-y.

1362
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:08,100
So, that's why I was...

1363
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:08,560
The MLG...

1364
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:10,260
Yeah, the MLG glasses!

1365
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:12,080
I was like, guys, I don't want...

1366
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:14,280
I don't want to use the MLG glasses.

1367
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:15,600
Because I was wearing that, too.

1368
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:16,400
I...

1369
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,480
I was wearing that.

1370
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:18,800
Honestly, like...

1371
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,040
I wanted, like...

1372
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:22,320
I was gonna ask if we could keep it on...

1373
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:23,640
Left Dragoon.

1374
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:24,780
But then, like, I...

1375
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:27,720
Because I didn't want to wear the MLG glasses because it looked weird.

1376
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:32,260
I did!

1377
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:33,120
I asked!

1378
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,040
Okay, that's something I wanted to polish.

1379
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:36,720
I wanted to ask them if we...

1380
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:40,920
Because, like, I want to ask if we could swap the glasses to my aviators.

1381
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,140
Because it makes more sense.

1382
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:44,580
Why the fuck am I wearing a different...

1383
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:45,200
Sunglasses?

1384
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:47,860
And then, they were saying, like, oh, we can't fix that.

1385
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:51,200
Like, that's gonna take us a couple of more days to fix that.

1386
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,320
So, I was just like, okay.

1387
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:53,320
Can you just...

1388
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:55,040
We're like, we can add stuff to it.

1389
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:56,560
So, that's...

1390
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,300
That's something I wanted to polish, too.

1391
00:55:58,820 --> 00:55:59,260
That's...

1392
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:02,340
That's something I wanted to change.

1393
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:04,680
But I...

1394
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:04,960
I...

1395
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,400
I changed the MLG...

1396
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,040
MLG glasses.

1397
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,380
Because I was like, okay, that's...

1398
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:11,580
That's too Mimi.

1399
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:13,300
That's way too Mimi.

1400
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:14,400
Oh, and then...

1401
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,280
These are the original cat ears.

1402
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:17,740
And I was like...

1403
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:19,100
Because, like, they showed me this.

1404
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:22,440
And I was like, why the fuck is it bigger than my...

1405
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:24,100
It was so big.

1406
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:26,800
So, we made the cat ears smaller.

1407
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,400
Yeah, that's so big.

1408
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,460
And it wasn't even the same color.

1409
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:33,180
So, um...

1410
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,920
We were able to change that in time, too.

1411
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:38,260
And, like, have it so that...

1412
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:39,540
Like, it was like, you know...

1413
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:41,360
Actually, uh...

1414
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:41,880
Uh...

1415
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:43,160
Actually, like, you know...

1416
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:43,840
My colors.

1417
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:45,100
And also, like...

1418
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:46,340
A lot smaller.

1419
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:47,800
Um...

1420
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:48,940
Win, thank you for the super chat.

1421
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:49,180
Thank you.

1422
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:49,620
Thank you.

1423
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:50,600
Happy birthday, Doki.

1424
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:52,260
I can hear fireworks outside.

1425
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:53,400
Celebrating your birthday.

1426
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:53,880
Yeah!

1427
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:55,480
Guys, you hear...

1428
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:56,920
If you hear fireworks...

1429
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:57,780
They're celebrating...

1430
00:56:57,780 --> 00:56:58,920
My birthday.

1431
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:00,080
Yeah.

1432
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:01,880
I'm all ears.

1433
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:08,000
Um...

1434
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:08,440
Um...

1435
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:08,600
But, yeah.

1436
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:09,480
Those are all the, like...

1437
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:10,180
The little...

1438
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:11,060
The little things.

1439
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:12,580
Oh, I'm so excited to...

1440
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:13,660
This is the one...

1441
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:14,120
The one...

1442
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:15,960
The things I'm super excited about...

1443
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:17,080
After this stream...

1444
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:18,020
Is...

1445
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:19,180
Um...

1446
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:20,320
This one here earlier.

1447
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:21,820
My birthday cake!

1448
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:22,880
Yeah!

1449
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:24,560
Cool!

1450
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,260
Thank you for the 10 get the sheds!

1451
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:26,700
Thank you!

1452
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:27,600
Thank you!

1453
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,840
I'm so excited!

1454
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:32,460
I'm so excited about my birthday cake!

1455
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:33,440
Ah!

1456
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:36,640
Yeah!

1457
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:38,900
It looks so cute!

1458
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:39,680
I'm so excited!

1459
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,180
I don't even remember what flavor...

1460
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:42,300
What flavor I picked.

1461
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:43,700
I think I picked Earl Grey?

1462
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:44,280
I think?

1463
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:44,880
I'm pretty sure.

1464
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:45,620
I don't remember.

1465
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:46,320
But...

1466
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:47,860
Look how cute this is!

1467
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:49,380
Ah!

1468
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:50,620
I can't wait to eat you!

1469
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:51,520
Okay, which one do I eat first?

1470
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,720
I'm gonna break Longoon's neck!

1471
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:54,580
I mean...

1472
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:54,960
I'm yummy!

1473
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:57,380
Yes, they're all...

1474
00:57:57,380 --> 00:57:58,000
It's all edible!

1475
00:57:58,540 --> 00:57:58,980
It's all...

1476
00:57:58,980 --> 00:57:59,860
It's a chiffon...

1477
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:00,400
The chiffon cake?

1478
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:01,220
Is that how...

1479
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:01,660
It's called?

1480
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:02,500
The chiffon?

1481
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:03,620
Um...

1482
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:04,080
But...

1483
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:04,520
Um...

1484
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:05,200
I'm gonna...

1485
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,040
I'm gonna break the Longoon's neck and go...

1486
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:08,080
You know?

1487
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:08,700
Like that...

1488
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:09,220
Pizza...

1489
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:10,140
I said a pizza man give.

1490
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:10,640
Like the...

1491
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:13,140
The guy that walks up and then like...

1492
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:13,680
Like...

1493
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:13,940
Uh...

1494
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:14,800
Steals someone...

1495
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:15,040
Some...

1496
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:17,040
Like steals something from someone's hand and you're gonna go...

1497
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,260
And then leaves.

1498
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:18,960
That's me.

1499
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:21,840
That's me with Longoon.

1500
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:26,240
My son.

1501
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:28,420
Zumi, thank you for the super chat.

1502
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:29,340
Thank you.

1503
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:31,660
Happy birthday, Doki.

1504
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:34,400
Do you plan on releasing an instrumental for your new original?

1505
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:35,780
I'd love to cover it.

1506
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:37,160
It'd make you shine.

1507
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:38,520
It'd make you smile.

1508
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:40,800
Thank you for the super chat.

1509
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:41,300
Zumi, thank you.

1510
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:44,120
Yes, I'm planning on releasing...

1511
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:48,040
You know, all this usual stuff when it comes to original songs.

1512
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:50,560
Um, it's gonna be a while until it's released.

1513
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:53,140
Because, um, I haven't contacted anyone.

1514
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:54,540
Look how they give it a 50!

1515
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:55,280
Get the chips!

1516
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:55,780
Thank you!

1517
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:56,500
Thank you!

1518
00:58:56,760 --> 00:59:01,040
But like I said, I haven't reached out to anyone regarding the MV yet.

1519
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:04,120
Um, so, um, that's what's gonna take the most time.

1520
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:08,200
Because you guys might know, when it comes to music videos, I don't...

1521
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:11,160
I'm not a person who goes with a user route with MVs.

1522
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:14,700
Where, like, you know, it's, like, maybe, like, three to four illustrations.

1523
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:19,200
And then, like, um, and then it's just, like, following the tempo and stuff.

1524
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:23,760
I like having an actual story that goes along with the music videos.

1525
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:27,240
Um, I know it's, like, a lot more expensive and a lot more time consuming.

1526
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,400
But I like having the experience.

1527
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:33,460
Like, you know, the experience that comes with, um, watching...

1528
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:35,700
Watching these music videos and stuff like that.

1529
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:37,320
Like, I want, like, the...

1530
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:41,480
Um, so, that's why, like, that's gonna take a while in general.

1531
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:43,800
So, yeah, I hope you guys can wait for it.

1532
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:44,640
I really do.

1533
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:46,300
Maybe I'll release, like...

1534
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:46,940
I don't know.

1535
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:49,740
Maybe I'll release the Spotify version or something.

1536
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,440
Like, where you can just get the music on Spotify.

1537
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:56,140
Um, but, like, for the MV-wise, uh...

1538
00:59:56,140 --> 00:59:57,940
Like, video-wise, I'm gonna...

1539
00:59:57,940 --> 00:59:59,780
It's gonna be a while until it's released.

1540
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:01,280
Um...

1541
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:03,040
Yeah, thank you for the Akasupa!

1542
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:04,400
Thank you, thank you!

1543
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:06,160
Happy birthday, Doki!

1544
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:07,780
Thank you for the concert!

1545
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:09,340
The Forever song was so good!

1546
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:10,220
Thank you!

1547
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:11,140
Oh, yeah.

1548
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:14,180
Speaking of the original song...

1549
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:16,940
The lyrics for that was originally a lot sexier.

1550
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:19,140
Like, a lot more, like...

1551
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:20,800
What do you mean by a lot sexier?

1552
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:22,460
Um...

1553
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:25,260
The lyrics for it was very suggestive.

1554
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:27,620
And then, like, one of them was, like...

1555
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:28,560
Baby...

1556
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:29,620
Something, something, something.

1557
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:31,740
And then I was like...

1558
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:32,120
I don't...

1559
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:32,980
Can we change that?

1560
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:33,820
Hahaha!

1561
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:35,260
That's like...

1562
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:36,760
I don't call anyone baby.

1563
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:37,620
It's okay...

1564
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:42,940
It was like...

1565
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:43,340
I was like...

1566
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:44,300
Okay, we gotta...

1567
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:46,060
I am sorry, like...

1568
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:48,160
We gotta tone that down a little bit.

1569
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:48,660
It's too...

1570
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:49,380
It's a little...

1571
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:50,240
Too sexy.

1572
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:51,640
Hahaha!

1573
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:55,500
But there was, like, other parts in there...

1574
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:56,280
Where I was like...

1575
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:57,140
Oh, wait, maybe...

1576
01:00:57,140 --> 01:01:26,720
Okay, I'll tell you what I've robbed you from... I'll let you know what you could have had... Let me see... I just need to scroll it up... Tell us what I took from you... I felt like it was a very sensual...

1577
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:29,100
and a bit sexy.

1578
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:33,500
I was like, it feels a little too out of character for me.

1579
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:43,000
Okay, and then... Oh, I wish?

1580
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:43,960
I don't know.

1581
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:45,740
Oh, wait, wait, maybe?

1582
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:46,720
Let me see.

1583
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:48,120
Let me see if this is the original.

1584
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:50,860
Oh, no, this is like the edited version.

1585
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:52,800
Okay, this is... Okay.

1586
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,540
Baby, it's our story.

1587
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:59,260
So, that's like the one of the first line.

1588
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:01,880
And I was like, I don't want to call people baby.

1589
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:02,860
I...

1590
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:09,800
That's what I said.

1591
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:12,320
I was like, I don't want to call people baby.

1592
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:19,020
Yeah, so... No, there's more.

1593
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,160
There was more to it.

1594
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:24,260
But that's the only thing I could see because like, you know, there's like chat message previews.

1595
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:26,860
So, like, when they send a link, there's a preview of it.

1596
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,820
So, the preview showed the old version of it.

1597
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,500
But if I click it, it's the new lyrics.

1598
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:35,400
So, I did... All I could... Like, the only thing I could remember was baby.

1599
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:38,240
But I remember some of the lyrics were like, very sensual.

1600
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:40,500
And I was like, oh, I want to tone that down a little.

1601
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:48,500
So, I don't remember where there was like, the sexy part was.

1602
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:49,340
I don't remember.

1603
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:52,680
But I was like, hello.

1604
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:55,900
We were like, what the fuck?

1605
01:02:57,100 --> 01:02:57,500
Doki?

1606
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:00,340
And I was like, hello.

1607
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:06,880
Doki?

1608
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:10,980
Lord, thank you for the 10 gift of ships.

1609
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:11,360
Thank you.

1610
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:12,120
Thank you.

1611
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:16,620
Doki Bird?

1612
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:22,940
Britannia, thank you for the Akasupa.

1613
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:23,440
Thank you.

1614
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:24,020
Thank you.

1615
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:25,540
Missed the concert for now.

1616
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:26,080
Do the work.

1617
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:27,640
Hope you have a happy birthday.

1618
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:28,440
Thank you.

1619
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:29,960
Thank you for the Akasupa.

1620
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:30,800
Thank you.

1621
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:31,540
Thank you.

1622
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:32,360
I appreciate it.

1623
01:03:32,380 --> 01:03:32,780
Don't worry.

1624
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:35,380
The polish version will be up...

1625
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:36,760
I don't know if it's soon.

1626
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:39,080
But maybe, like, one or two months.

1627
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:39,620
I hope.

1628
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:41,400
So, um...

1629
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:42,640
I'll let you guys know.

1630
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:43,620
I'll keep you very transparent.

1631
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:46,020
Because this one, I'm working close with the...

1632
01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:47,580
Um...

1633
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:51,040
I'm working really close with the 3D production team.

1634
01:03:51,220 --> 01:03:52,780
So, I'll let you guys know.

1635
01:03:53,180 --> 01:03:53,540
Um...

1636
01:03:53,540 --> 01:03:55,140
I'll be very transparent about when...

1637
01:03:55,140 --> 01:03:56,320
How long it'll be.

1638
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,260
The thing is, I don't know if it is one or two months.

1639
01:03:58,340 --> 01:03:59,380
Because, like I said...

1640
01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:03,280
After my concert, they're working on another 3D project for someone else.

1641
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:03,860
I don't know who.

1642
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:04,660
Um...

1643
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:06,600
So, like, they're gonna be on a different project.

1644
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:09,360
So, then after they finish that, they'll come back to me.

1645
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:11,820
But I'm only fixing, like, a couple of stuff.

1646
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:13,080
So, like, you know...

1647
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:14,180
Like, the full...

1648
01:04:14,180 --> 01:04:16,560
The only thing that's, like, full fix...

1649
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:17,680
Is, um...

1650
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:18,820
Is Escape from the City.

1651
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:19,920
So, um...

1652
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,880
That's the one that we're, like, fully redoing.

1653
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:22,560
Um...

1654
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:23,980
But other stuff is just minor stuff, too.

1655
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:24,760
So, yeah.

1656
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:26,260
Oh, yeah.

1657
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:27,500
And I wanna add two more songs.

1658
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:27,800
Oh, yeah.

1659
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:28,740
And adding two more songs.

1660
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:29,220
So, like...

1661
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:30,020
Those are, like...

1662
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:30,640
The big fixes.

1663
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:31,960
But...

1664
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:32,940
Um...

1665
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:33,600
But, like...

1666
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:34,360
It should be fine.

1667
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:35,000
Yeah!

1668
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:37,480
What else do I wanna talk about?

1669
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:39,440
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

1670
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:41,300
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

1671
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:42,920
I love talking to you guys, though.

1672
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:43,660
Wow, wow, wow.

1673
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:45,040
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1674
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,940
I know, like, normally people do, like, super fucking long birthday streams.

1675
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:51,880
But, like, I don't have to stomp enough for that.

1676
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:52,400
Um...

1677
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:54,260
Today's been a long day for me, to be fair.

1678
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,560
Because I've been up since 10 in the morning.

1679
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:58,340
Um...

1680
01:04:58,340 --> 01:04:59,360
I do have, like...

1681
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:00,280
I do have...

1682
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:02,080
In terms of big projects...

1683
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:05,400
I do have, like, one more big project left.

1684
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:06,980
And then, like...

1685
01:05:06,980 --> 01:05:08,740
I think I'm taking a small...

1686
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:10,060
Okay, but, like, to be fair...

1687
01:05:10,060 --> 01:05:12,620
That big project is all self...

1688
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:14,520
It's, like, self-delegating itself.

1689
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:15,280
So, like...

1690
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:18,700
I don't have to really do anything other than paying them.

1691
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:18,980
Um...

1692
01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:21,360
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1693
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:24,280
So...

1694
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:26,460
Alright, I don't know when that one's gonna be done.

1695
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:27,640
Um...

1696
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:28,440
So, we'll see.

1697
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:30,700
I know some of you might be wondering...

1698
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:32,340
Oh, are you planning to do anything in...

1699
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:32,900
What is it?

1700
01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:34,400
Like, the Dragoon anniversary?

1701
01:05:35,540 --> 01:05:37,360
The Dragoon anniversary date?

1702
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:38,620
But, like...

1703
01:05:38,620 --> 01:05:39,280
That's too...

1704
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:41,180
There's too many events going on back...

1705
01:05:41,180 --> 01:05:42,440
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1706
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:45,600
So, like...

1707
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:46,260
Um...

1708
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:48,700
I don't know.

1709
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:50,080
Maybe we'll just spend time together.

1710
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:52,280
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1711
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:53,980
The Dragoon anniversary.

1712
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:55,240
Um...

1713
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:57,080
And if people are asking about WrestleTuber...

1714
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:59,280
I have not planned that...

1715
01:06:00,180 --> 01:06:00,940
In a long...

1716
01:06:00,940 --> 01:06:02,760
I have not done any plans for that.

1717
01:06:03,180 --> 01:06:03,580
Because...

1718
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:06,080
I've been doing so many...

1719
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:07,700
I mean, I could give you, like, a silly...

1720
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:09,020
VR chat...

1721
01:06:09,020 --> 01:06:09,860
Stuff again.

1722
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:11,860
But the only issue is that...

1723
01:06:11,860 --> 01:06:12,480
Um...

1724
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:13,720
I don't have any of my...

1725
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:14,520
I don't know...

1726
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:16,040
I don't have any of my, like, those...

1727
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:17,600
Trackers on the...

1728
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:18,480
On the ceilings.

1729
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:19,980
I don't have any of that right now.

1730
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:21,400
I need to buy it again.

1731
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:23,040
And also, like...

1732
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:23,760
I need to, like...

1733
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:25,620
My ceilings are really high.

1734
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:27,080
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1735
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:30,420
I'm just one bird.

1736
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:32,180
My ceilings are so...

1737
01:06:32,180 --> 01:06:33,820
My ceilings are so high.

1738
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:35,720
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1739
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:38,600
For VR's chat and stuff.

1740
01:06:40,220 --> 01:06:40,740
Um...

1741
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:41,100
Yeah.

1742
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:42,540
Nextie, thank you for the Super Chat.

1743
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:43,340
Thank you, thank you.

1744
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:46,000
Spending time with you is the best present we could ask for.

1745
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:46,700
Thank you.

1746
01:06:46,860 --> 01:06:47,700
Thank you for the Super Chat.

1747
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:48,500
Thank you, thank you.

1748
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:49,120
Oh my god.

1749
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:50,500
Wait, there's, like, stuff I wanted to...

1750
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:51,240
Actually, I wrote...

1751
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:53,140
There were so many things I wanted to talk about.

1752
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:54,580
Because I, like, wrote stuff down.

1753
01:06:54,580 --> 01:06:55,740
And I realized I never...

1754
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:56,600
Um...

1755
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:57,840
I never talked about it.

1756
01:06:59,000 --> 01:06:59,320
Um...

1757
01:06:59,320 --> 01:06:59,620
Okay.

1758
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:01,740
Let me see.

1759
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:02,700
Oh!

1760
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:03,540
Funny story.

1761
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:04,980
I can tell this story, I think.

1762
01:07:05,140 --> 01:07:05,880
Yeah, I can tell this story.

1763
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:07,100
Okay, so...

1764
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:07,600
Um...

1765
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:08,720
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1766
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:10,720
Um...

1767
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:11,500
So...

1768
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:12,080
Um...

1769
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:13,500
I waited to tell this story.

1770
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:14,520
Um...

1771
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:15,140
So...

1772
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:15,960
Um...

1773
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:17,560
I did a sponsored stream.

1774
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:18,720
Um...

1775
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:19,580
But, like, you know, I do...

1776
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:22,100
Okay, there's another reason why I do a lot of sponsored streams.

1777
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:22,780
I...

1778
01:07:22,780 --> 01:07:23,180
I never...

1779
01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:24,800
I don't say no to sponsored stuff.

1780
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:26,400
Because, like, I need...

1781
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:27,360
You know, like...

1782
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:27,980
Pays the bills.

1783
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:29,680
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1784
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:32,240
Anyway.

1785
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:33,500
Um...

1786
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:34,540
So, you know...

1787
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:36,760
I was worried that I...

1788
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:37,480
Um...

1789
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:40,540
I was worried that I, like...

1790
01:07:40,540 --> 01:07:41,240
Over...

1791
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:42,280
Charge...

1792
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:43,540
When it comes to my rates.

1793
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:46,860
Because before then, I get paid even less.

1794
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:48,340
So, like...

1795
01:07:48,340 --> 01:07:49,800
I was always worried...

1796
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:50,560
That, like...

1797
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:51,880
I'm overcharging.

1798
01:07:52,620 --> 01:07:53,260
Um...

1799
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:54,220
And, like...

1800
01:07:54,220 --> 01:07:55,160
The thing is...

1801
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:56,300
So, I always be, like...

1802
01:07:56,300 --> 01:07:57,580
No, I don't know if I should...

1803
01:07:57,580 --> 01:07:58,340
Those should be my...

1804
01:07:58,340 --> 01:07:59,580
So, I'm always, like, fighting.

1805
01:08:00,140 --> 01:08:00,940
Not fighting.

1806
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:01,820
But, like...

1807
01:08:01,820 --> 01:08:05,600
Negotiating with my manager on how much to be paid.

1808
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:06,720
Because, like...

1809
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:09,860
I don't know what my worth actually is.

1810
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:11,060
To be fair.

1811
01:08:11,580 --> 01:08:12,040
Um...

1812
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:12,820
Due to, like...

1813
01:08:12,820 --> 01:08:15,540
I always feel like I'm being...

1814
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:18,300
I always feel like I'm charging too much.

1815
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:19,940
I no longer feel that.

1816
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:21,360
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1817
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:22,600
Because of...

1818
01:08:23,220 --> 01:08:25,020
Because of one incident.

1819
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:26,920
So...

1820
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:27,640
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1821
01:08:27,740 --> 01:08:28,640
One day...

1822
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,020
For one of my sponsors.

1823
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:32,720
Um...

1824
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:33,760
My...

1825
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:37,320
My manager was like, I need to call you right now.

1826
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:39,000
And I was like, Why?

1827
01:08:39,340 --> 01:08:39,940
Ha, ha, ha.

1828
01:08:39,940 --> 01:08:40,260
You know?

1829
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:40,900
I'm confused.

1830
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:42,920
I was like, Why do you need to call me right now?

1831
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:43,380
I'm still...

1832
01:08:43,380 --> 01:08:43,800
I'm working.

1833
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:47,420
And then he's like, No, you need to know this.

1834
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:49,800
And then, um...

1835
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:50,620
And then, like...

1836
01:08:50,620 --> 01:08:51,880
I got in a call.

1837
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:53,300
And he was like...

1838
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:55,180
He was like, Look at this.

1839
01:08:55,380 --> 01:08:56,420
Ha, ha, ha.

1840
01:08:56,580 --> 01:08:58,640
And then, apparently...

1841
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:00,820
One of the sponsors...

1842
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:02,760
Accidentally...

1843
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:04,560
Leaked to us...

1844
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:06,740
The wrong contract...

1845
01:09:06,740 --> 01:09:08,700
Of another content creator.

1846
01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:09,620
And...

1847
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:11,360
And it showed how much...

1848
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:12,340
They were paid.

1849
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:13,440
And...

1850
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:14,700
And by the way...

1851
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:15,640
They were like...

1852
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:15,880
They...

1853
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:16,440
We were...

1854
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:18,300
We asked like, Oh, should we have...

1855
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:19,700
Should we, like...

1856
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:20,740
Charge this much?

1857
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,840
And then, I was just like...

1858
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:23,740
I was like, Oh, man.

1859
01:09:23,780 --> 01:09:25,720
And they were like, Oh, we're sort of like...

1860
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:27,500
Out of budget right now...

1861
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:28,380
For Joki.

1862
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:29,560
So, like...

1863
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:29,960
Um...

1864
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:31,140
We're gonna have to pass for that.

1865
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:31,780
And then, I was like...

1866
01:09:31,780 --> 01:09:32,360
Oh my gosh.

1867
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:33,220
I'm way too expensive.

1868
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:33,840
I can...

1869
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:35,140
Tell them that I was...

1870
01:09:35,140 --> 01:09:36,320
I'm willing to do this sponsor.

1871
01:09:36,580 --> 01:09:37,280
So, like...

1872
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:37,740
Um...

1873
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:38,960
You can, like, tell them we're...

1874
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:40,420
We're open to negotiate.

1875
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:41,880
Because it's still like...

1876
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:43,360
Free mo- Like, not free money.

1877
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:44,300
But, like, you know...

1878
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:46,680
I'm streaming a video game.

1879
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:47,880
And I get paid to do it.

1880
01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:49,040
Like, for a game.

1881
01:09:49,180 --> 01:09:51,140
Like, what if I was planning on streaming that game anyway?

1882
01:09:51,460 --> 01:09:51,820
Like...

1883
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:54,380
Like, it's just an hour or two.

1884
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:55,240
Um...

1885
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:55,680
It's fine.

1886
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:56,740
So, I was like...

1887
01:09:56,740 --> 01:09:57,000
Okay.

1888
01:09:57,660 --> 01:09:58,020
Um...

1889
01:09:58,020 --> 01:09:58,540
No, no.

1890
01:09:58,640 --> 01:09:59,440
This is a different...

1891
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:00,300
This is a different one.

1892
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:01,000
This is a...

1893
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,240
This is a different one.

1894
01:10:02,660 --> 01:10:03,020
Um...

1895
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:13,280
This is... this is for a different... I didn't... No, you might think I told this story before, but this is a different one.

1896
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:19,580
And now I was just like, oh, just tell them I'm willing to, like... because they were going to pass.

1897
01:10:19,740 --> 01:10:25,740
And then they're like, oh, yeah, like, oh, this is out of our... the budget that we have for this promotion.

1898
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:31,580
So, um, so then they're like, oh, yeah, we'll do... I was like, yeah, that's fine.

1899
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:32,380
I'm fine with that.

1900
01:10:32,380 --> 01:10:42,360
Like, and then... and then so, when we were gonna sign the contract, the agent accidentally gave us someone else's contract.

1901
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:44,700
And I saw how much they were getting paid.

1902
01:10:44,980 --> 01:10:46,360
And they were getting paid.

1903
01:10:50,820 --> 01:10:55,300
They were getting paid 10 times more than me.

1904
01:11:01,420 --> 01:11:03,460
For 50% less work.

1905
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:13,580
I was like, to be fair, I was like, okay, but, like, I guess, like, they're, like, they're, like, a pretty big kind of creative.

1906
01:11:13,580 --> 01:11:15,080
But I was just like, what the fuck?

1907
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:19,000
I was just like...

1908
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,620
I was just like...

1909
01:11:20,620 --> 01:11:23,820
And then my manager's like, never think you're...

1910
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:24,600
Never...

1911
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:29,220
Never think you overcharge yourself ever again, Doki.

1912
01:11:29,540 --> 01:11:30,740
I was like, you're right.

1913
01:11:31,180 --> 01:11:31,800
You're...

1914
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:33,580
You're right.

1915
01:11:37,220 --> 01:11:39,720
I was just like...

1916
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:42,160
Never think you're getting...

1917
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:45,200
You're overcharging yourself ever again.

1918
01:11:45,740 --> 01:11:48,180
And that was my wake-up call.

1919
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:49,320
That was...

1920
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:51,960
That was my wake-up call there.

1921
01:11:52,460 --> 01:11:53,460
I'll never...

1922
01:11:53,460 --> 01:11:58,320
I'll never fight my manager again about him trying to get me more money.

1923
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:04,780
Yeah.

1924
01:12:04,940 --> 01:12:06,560
I was just like, what?

1925
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:08,800
And I was like, what the fuck?

1926
01:12:09,140 --> 01:12:10,320
Holy shit!

1927
01:12:10,820 --> 01:12:13,960
When I saw that amount, I didn't...

1928
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:14,800
And then...

1929
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:15,800
So...

1930
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:18,260
By the way, my manager, um...

1931
01:12:18,260 --> 01:12:19,980
They have, like, an actual real job.

1932
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:21,300
So they do this...

1933
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:23,020
They manage me for the fun of it.

1934
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:24,480
Because they love negotiating.

1935
01:12:24,820 --> 01:12:25,840
So, like...

1936
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:27,660
Because it's, like, a good skill to have.

1937
01:12:27,660 --> 01:12:28,980
Like, good skill to build on.

1938
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:30,140
So, like...

1939
01:12:30,140 --> 01:12:31,340
They love negotiating.

1940
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:31,880
So, like...

1941
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:34,020
This is, like, for the fun of it for them.

1942
01:12:35,740 --> 01:12:36,260
Um...

1943
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:37,300
Um...

1944
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:38,200
And...

1945
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:38,700
Um...

1946
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:39,580
So, like...

1947
01:12:39,580 --> 01:12:41,140
My manager...

1948
01:12:41,140 --> 01:12:43,480
Like, they actually have, like, a good job.

1949
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:46,400
And my manager was like...

1950
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:47,160
Was like...

1951
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:49,040
This is more than I'm making.

1952
01:12:53,150 --> 01:12:54,810
I was just...

1953
01:12:54,810 --> 01:12:55,090
Like...

1954
01:12:56,450 --> 01:12:56,810
Like...

1955
01:12:57,170 --> 01:12:57,950
He's like...

1956
01:12:57,950 --> 01:12:58,890
Like...

1957
01:12:58,890 --> 01:12:59,610
He's like...

1958
01:12:59,610 --> 01:13:01,710
My happiness...

1959
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:03,630
When I make it a year.

1960
01:13:03,910 --> 01:13:04,730
I was like...

1961
01:13:04,730 --> 01:13:05,430
Holy fuck!

1962
01:13:06,250 --> 01:13:06,970
I...

1963
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:09,930
When he saw...

1964
01:13:09,930 --> 01:13:12,310
When he saw the contract...

1965
01:13:12,310 --> 01:13:12,750
I...

1966
01:13:13,610 --> 01:13:14,930
I was like...

1967
01:13:14,930 --> 01:13:15,830
Holy fuck!

1968
01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:18,150
That's crazy, dude!

1969
01:13:18,150 --> 01:13:19,530
That's crazy!

1970
01:13:20,130 --> 01:13:21,650
I am...

1971
01:13:24,310 --> 01:13:25,230
Um...

1972
01:13:25,230 --> 01:13:26,150
Yeah...

1973
01:13:26,150 --> 01:13:26,530
Uh...

1974
01:13:26,530 --> 01:13:27,070
But yeah...

1975
01:13:27,070 --> 01:13:27,390
That's...

1976
01:13:27,390 --> 01:13:28,130
That's...

1977
01:13:28,130 --> 01:13:28,570
That's...

1978
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:30,230
That's actually insane.

1979
01:13:30,810 --> 01:13:31,730
Um...

1980
01:13:31,730 --> 01:13:33,770
Life ain't fair sometimes.

1981
01:13:34,230 --> 01:13:35,950
Says the anime girl.

1982
01:13:36,450 --> 01:13:36,850
That...

1983
01:13:36,850 --> 01:13:38,510
Says the anime girl.

1984
01:13:38,610 --> 01:13:40,010
When she was like...

1985
01:13:40,010 --> 01:13:40,830
Bye...

1986

01:13:47,210 --> 01:13:47,850
Um...

1990
01:13:47,850 --> 01:13:48,070
Oh yeah!

1991
01:13:48,630 --> 01:13:50,090
Speaking of the concert...

1992
01:13:50,090 --> 01:13:52,350
I want to talk about the concert a little bit more.

1993
01:13:53,270 --> 01:13:53,730
Uh...

1994
01:13:53,730 --> 01:13:55,070
But basically...

1995
01:13:55,070 --> 01:13:56,150
I just want you guys to know...

1996
01:13:56,150 --> 01:13:57,210
I do not have...

1997
01:13:57,210 --> 01:13:58,830
Any sponsors...

1998
01:13:58,830 --> 01:13:59,850
Going into like...

1999
01:13:59,850 --> 01:14:01,070
I mean, you guys are my sponsors.

01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:01,650
Like...

2001
01:14:02,210 --> 01:14:04,130
The sponsor is me and you.

2002
01:14:04,790 --> 01:14:05,250
Um...

2003
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:06,750
But that's why like a lot of concerts...

2004
01:14:06,750 --> 01:14:08,290
You see like sponsors and stuff.

2005
01:14:08,430 --> 01:14:09,430
You know, like...

2006
01:14:09,430 --> 01:14:10,190
Um...

2007
01:14:10,190 --> 01:14:12,130
Like lots of sponsors going in.

2008
01:14:12,850 --> 01:14:13,450
And...

2009
01:14:13,450 --> 01:14:13,950
Uh...

2010
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:15,070
Like to like...

2011
01:14:15,070 --> 01:14:15,490
Uh...

You know, contribute the funding of everything.

2013
01:14:18,130 --> 01:14:18,730
So...

2014
01:14:18,730 --> 01:14:20,430
I organized all of it myself.

2015
01:14:21,070 --> 01:14:21,670
Um...

2016
01:14:21,670 --> 01:14:22,610
I had no company.

2017
01:14:22,810 --> 01:14:24,590
Managing or like overseeing everything.

2018
01:14:24,950 --> 01:14:26,230
It was literally just me.

2019
01:14:26,570 --> 01:14:27,570
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

2020
01:14:27,570 --> 01:14:28,030
And...

2021
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:29,410
And it was all like...

2022
01:14:29,410 --> 01:14:30,050
Done...

2023
01:14:30,050 --> 01:14:31,210
Within a month.

2024
01:14:31,370 --> 01:14:32,310
So like literally...

2025
01:14:32,310 --> 01:14:33,210
Like it was just me.

2026
01:14:33,550 --> 01:14:35,070
I paid for everything.

2027
01:14:35,510 --> 01:14:36,310
And like...

2028
01:14:36,310 --> 01:14:37,830
I overseed everything.

2029
01:14:39,170 --> 01:14:39,770
Um...

2030
01:14:39,770 --> 01:14:40,710
And all that stuff.

2031
01:14:40,910 --> 01:14:41,410
So like...

2032
01:14:41,410 --> 01:14:42,010
And you guys.

2033
01:14:42,130 --> 01:14:42,530
You guys...

2034
01:14:42,530 --> 01:14:43,190
You guys...

2035
01:14:43,190 --> 01:14:44,290
Help paid for it too.

2036
01:14:44,630 --> 01:14:45,470
Ha ha ha ha!

2037
01:14:45,830 --> 01:14:47,130
It's sponsored by...

2038
01:14:47,130 --> 01:14:48,830
The Dragoons!

2039
01:14:49,290 --> 01:14:50,490
Ha ha ha ha!

2040
01:14:51,010 --> 01:14:51,690
Ha ha ha ha!

2041
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:53,510
Uh...

2042
01:14:53,510 --> 01:14:54,930
Let's see...

2043
01:14:54,930 --> 01:14:56,650
What else do I want to talk about?

2044
01:14:57,210 --> 01:15:00,130
Wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow.

2045
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:02,470
Oh yeah, by the way, I just found out that...

2046
01:15:02,470 --> 01:15:03,610
It took the people...

2047
01:15:03,610 --> 01:15:05,070
Two weeks to make that...

2048
01:15:05,070 --> 01:15:05,910
Peak game.

2049
01:15:06,630 --> 01:15:07,030
Like...

2050
01:15:07,030 --> 01:15:07,370
I was like...

2051
01:15:07,370 --> 01:15:07,890
What the fuck?

2052
01:15:08,190 --> 01:15:08,530
Ha ha ha!

2053
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:10,130
That game was only made in two weeks.

2054
01:15:10,190 --> 01:15:10,790
You guys know that?

2055
01:15:11,010 --> 01:15:12,870
That was a crazy fun fact.

2056
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:13,330
I was like...

2057
01:15:13,330 --> 01:15:13,730
Holy shit.

2058
01:15:14,370 --> 01:15:16,030
Ha ha ha ha ha!

2059
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:17,050
Ha ha ha ha!

2060
01:15:17,530 --> 01:15:18,250
Ha ha ha ha!

2061
01:15:18,570 --> 01:15:18,990
Ha ha ha ha!

2062
01:15:20,230 --> 01:15:22,650
The new outfit looked so adorable!

2063
01:15:23,390 --> 01:15:24,870
And the birthday concept was amazing!

2064
01:15:25,730 --> 01:15:25,990
Um...

2065
01:15:25,990 --> 01:15:27,570
Hope you had a great birthday today!

2066
01:15:27,990 --> 01:15:29,170
Doki, happy birthday!

2067
01:15:29,630 --> 01:15:29,870
Thank you!

2068
01:15:29,970 --> 01:15:31,250
Thank you for the super chat, Phillip!

2069
01:15:31,470 --> 01:15:32,370
Thank you, thank you!

2070
01:15:32,670 --> 01:15:33,870
I really appreciate it.

2071
01:15:33,950 --> 01:15:34,610
Thank you guys.

2072
01:15:35,530 --> 01:15:35,950
Um...

2073
01:15:35,950 --> 01:15:37,110
Yeah, I thought I was like...

2074
01:15:37,110 --> 01:15:37,950
And it's not that expensive.

2075
01:15:38,110 --> 01:15:38,810
I thought it was...

2076
01:15:38,810 --> 01:15:40,910
I thought it was really neat that it really...

2077
01:15:40,910 --> 01:15:41,410
Like, you know...

2078
01:15:41,410 --> 01:15:42,610
It's such like...

2079
01:15:42,610 --> 01:15:45,190
Like a game that was clearly made for like...

2080
01:15:45,190 --> 01:15:45,630
You know...

2081
01:15:45,630 --> 01:15:47,610
They didn't expect it to be like super popular.

2082
01:15:47,730 --> 01:15:48,530
They just like...

2083
01:15:48,530 --> 01:15:50,470
Made it just for the sake of like...

2084
01:15:50,470 --> 01:15:50,890
Um...

2085
01:15:50,890 --> 01:15:51,850
Oh, it's just...

2086
01:15:51,850 --> 01:15:52,910
It's like a stupid idea.

2087
01:15:53,030 --> 01:15:53,490
Let's do it.

2088
01:15:53,810 --> 01:15:55,190
Ha ha ha ha!

2089
01:15:56,470 --> 01:15:56,950
Yeah.

2090
01:15:59,030 --> 01:15:59,510
Um...

2091
01:15:59,510 --> 01:16:01,590
Wait, they made a crab Dark Souls game?

2092
01:16:02,210 --> 01:16:02,690
What?

2093
01:16:04,410 --> 01:16:06,250
Oh yeah, by the way...

2094
01:16:08,170 --> 01:16:08,650
Um...

2095
01:16:08,650 --> 01:16:09,590
Um...

2096
01:16:09,590 --> 01:16:12,410
I still find it really funny that the Saja boys from...

2097
01:16:12,930 --> 01:16:15,610
That Korean K-pop Demon Hunters movie...

2098
01:16:15,630 --> 01:16:18,830
Is more popular than the actual main characters of the...

2099
01:16:18,830 --> 01:16:19,350
Ha ha ha!

2100
01:16:19,390 --> 01:16:20,070
The movie!

2101
01:16:20,430 --> 01:16:21,290
Ha ha ha!

2102
01:16:22,550 --> 01:16:23,110
Like...

2103
01:16:23,110 --> 01:16:24,530
That defeats the whole like...

2104
01:16:24,530 --> 01:16:25,790
Message of the film.

2105
01:16:26,190 --> 01:16:27,030
Ha ha ha!

2106
01:16:27,310 --> 01:16:27,830
Oh!

2107
01:16:28,430 --> 01:16:29,110
They did it!

2108
01:16:29,250 --> 01:16:29,690
The crab...

2109
01:16:29,690 --> 01:16:29,890
Oh!

2110
01:16:30,030 --> 01:16:31,150
They did crab treasure!

2111
01:16:31,790 --> 01:16:32,350
Oh!

2112
01:16:33,110 --> 01:16:33,810
That's so...

2113
01:16:33,810 --> 01:16:34,990
I didn't know they were that...

2114
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:36,510
They were that company that did it?

2115
01:16:36,770 --> 01:16:37,350
Ha ha ha!

2116
01:16:37,450 --> 01:16:38,010
The demons!

2117
01:16:38,390 --> 01:16:38,950
No!

2118
01:16:39,270 --> 01:16:40,130
We fucked up!

2119
01:16:40,370 --> 01:16:41,690
The demons took over!

2120
01:16:42,210 --> 01:16:43,550
Ha ha ha!

2121
01:16:45,490 --> 01:16:46,720
I literally thought...

2122
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:48,230
Bro, like...

2123
01:16:48,230 --> 01:16:51,030
Oh yeah, I talked about this in the member stream...

2124
01:16:51,610 --> 01:16:52,150
But...

2125
01:16:52,150 --> 01:16:52,550
Um...

2126
01:16:52,550 --> 01:16:52,970
I was...

2127
01:16:52,970 --> 01:16:53,810
Cause I...

2128
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:54,930
Okay, for those who weren't...

2129
01:16:54,930 --> 01:16:55,950
There aren't members...

2130
01:16:55,950 --> 01:16:57,890
Or weren't there for the watch-along...

2131
01:16:57,890 --> 01:17:00,190
Last watch-along member stream...

2132
01:17:00,190 --> 01:17:00,990
Um...

2133
01:17:00,990 --> 01:17:02,550
The Saja boys are like...

2134
01:17:02,550 --> 01:17:03,350
More popular than...

2135
01:17:03,970 --> 01:17:04,290
Um...

2136
01:17:04,290 --> 01:17:05,030
The Huntrix...

2137
01:17:05,030 --> 01:17:07,010
And I thought it was so fucking funny...

2138
01:17:07,010 --> 01:17:08,730
Because there's actual like...

2139
01:17:08,730 --> 01:17:09,490
Video...

2140
01:17:09,490 --> 01:17:10,310
Videos...

2141
01:17:10,310 --> 01:17:10,950
Of like...

2142
01:17:10,950 --> 01:17:11,930
By the way...

2143
01:17:11,930 --> 01:17:12,110
The...

2144
01:17:12,110 --> 01:17:13,970
The whole point of like...

2145
01:17:13,970 --> 01:17:14,810
The Saja boys...

2146
01:17:14,810 --> 01:17:16,210
Is that they're blank slates...

2147
01:17:16,210 --> 01:17:18,030
So that you put your own...

2148
01:17:18,030 --> 01:17:18,630
Percent...

2149
01:17:18,630 --> 01:17:20,190
Head cannons onto them...

2150
01:17:20,190 --> 01:17:22,810
And if you look up any of the members...

2151
01:17:22,810 --> 01:17:23,010
Of...

2152
01:17:23,010 --> 01:17:23,870
That's not the main...

2153
01:17:23,870 --> 01:17:24,890
Like the main guy...

2154
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:25,550
Um...

2155
01:17:25,550 --> 01:17:27,550
That actually has a fucking personality...

2156
01:17:27,550 --> 01:17:30,130
But you put any of the members...

2157
01:17:30,790 --> 01:17:31,370
Um...

2158
01:17:31,370 --> 01:17:31,790
YouTube...

2159
01:17:31,790 --> 01:17:32,710
Any of the members...

2160
01:17:32,710 --> 01:17:33,070
Uh...

2161
01:17:33,070 --> 01:17:34,510
Of the Saja boys...

2162
01:17:34,510 --> 01:17:35,110
Um...

2163
01:17:35,110 --> 01:17:36,090
There are videos...

2164
01:17:36,090 --> 01:17:36,630
Where...

2165
01:17:36,630 --> 01:17:37,670
Where it's like...

2166
01:17:37,670 --> 01:17:37,950
Clip...

2167
01:17:37,950 --> 01:17:39,170
Clip compilation...

2168
01:17:39,170 --> 01:17:40,030
Of...

2169
01:17:40,030 --> 01:17:40,370
Like...

2170
01:17:40,370 --> 01:17:41,090
Any of them...

2171
01:17:41,090 --> 01:17:41,510
So like...

2172
01:17:41,510 --> 01:17:42,070
I don't know...

2173
01:17:42,070 --> 01:17:43,170
One of them is called baby, right?

2174
01:17:43,370 --> 01:17:44,950
Baby Saja boy...

2175
01:17:44,950 --> 01:17:46,030
And then...

2176
01:17:46,030 --> 01:17:47,630
There is a video...

2177
01:17:47,630 --> 01:17:48,830
Of it...

2178
01:17:48,830 --> 01:17:49,710
That's two...

2179
01:17:49,710 --> 01:17:50,550
Two point...

2180
01:17:50,550 --> 01:17:50,830
Wait!

2181
01:17:50,930 --> 01:17:52,610
It jumped a million views?

2182
01:17:53,010 --> 01:17:53,590
Okay...

2183
01:17:53,590 --> 01:17:53,930
I...

2184
01:17:53,930 --> 01:17:54,490
What?

2185
01:17:56,730 --> 01:17:57,330
So...

2186
01:17:57,330 --> 01:17:58,350
They have...

2187
01:17:58,350 --> 01:17:58,610
Zero...

2188
01:17:58,610 --> 01:17:59,230
They have...

2189
01:17:59,230 --> 01:18:00,770
Basically have zero lines...

2190
01:18:00,770 --> 01:18:01,230
And...

2191
01:18:01,230 --> 01:18:01,510
Yeah...

2192
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:01,950
It's...

2193
01:18:01,950 --> 01:18:02,270
Two...

2194
01:18:02,270 --> 01:18:02,550
Okay...

2195
01:18:02,550 --> 01:18:03,790
So this is an example...

2196
01:18:03,790 --> 01:18:04,190
So...

2197
01:18:04,190 --> 01:18:04,870
This has...

2198
01:18:04,870 --> 01:18:06,390
Two point six million views...

2199
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:07,110
And he...

2200
01:18:07,110 --> 01:18:08,270
He doesn't say...

2201
01:18:08,270 --> 01:18:09,050
He says like...

2202
01:18:09,050 --> 01:18:10,370
Two lines...

2203
01:18:12,530 --> 01:18:13,130
And...

2204
01:18:13,130 --> 01:18:13,730
And...

2205
01:18:13,730 --> 01:18:14,490
And there's like...

2206
01:18:14,490 --> 01:18:15,390
There's one...

2207
01:18:15,390 --> 01:18:15,850
For like...

2208
01:18:15,850 --> 01:18:16,450
Each of them...

2209
01:18:16,450 --> 01:18:17,690
So you see one for like...

2210
01:18:17,690 --> 01:18:19,710
I think the other one is like...

2211
01:18:19,710 --> 01:18:20,330
Mystery?

2212
01:18:20,710 --> 01:18:21,070
It's like...

2213
01:18:21,070 --> 01:18:22,290
Every single time...

2214
01:18:24,970 --> 01:18:27,590
Every single time...

2215
01:18:27,590 --> 01:18:28,110
Abby Saja...

2216
01:18:28,110 --> 01:18:29,810
Saja was on screen...

2217
01:18:29,810 --> 01:18:31,030
Every single time...

2218
01:18:31,030 --> 01:18:31,570
Mystery...

2219
01:18:31,570 --> 01:18:32,230
But it's like...

2220
01:18:32,230 --> 01:18:33,790
From the same...

2221
01:18:33,790 --> 01:18:35,890
It's like...

2222
01:18:35,890 --> 01:18:37,050
From the same...

2223
01:18:37,050 --> 01:18:37,450
Like...

2224
01:18:37,450 --> 01:18:38,170
Clips...

2225
01:18:38,170 --> 01:18:39,670
And they're literally reusing...

2226
01:18:39,670 --> 01:18:40,430
The same clips...

2227
01:18:40,430 --> 01:18:40,990
And then you...

2228
01:18:40,990 --> 01:18:42,810
The comments are so fucking funny...

2229
01:18:42,810 --> 01:18:43,390
I love...

2230
01:18:43,390 --> 01:18:44,850
I love the comments...

2231
01:18:44,850 --> 01:18:45,510
Like...

2232
01:18:45,510 --> 01:18:47,870
Um, what was it?

2233
01:18:47,970 --> 01:18:53,210
I was talking about one of the comments in the chat, but like, this is my favorite comment.

2234
01:18:54,390 --> 01:18:57,350
Because I was like, they have no personality!

2235
01:18:57,910 --> 01:18:59,770
What the fuck do you mean?

2236
01:19:00,330 --> 01:19:02,250
They're literally blank slates.

2237
01:19:02,370 --> 01:19:05,650
I have to talk about this again, because I find it so fucking funny.

2238
01:19:06,270 --> 01:19:08,730
Um, okay, wait.

2239
01:19:09,130 --> 01:19:10,010
Okay, where is it?

2240
01:19:10,050 --> 01:19:14,190
I need to, like, show you guys this again, because, like, I love, I love this quote.

2241
01:19:14,190 --> 01:19:16,590
Wait, this is the wrong one.

2242
01:19:16,850 --> 01:19:18,150
Where did I save it?

2243
01:19:18,670 --> 01:19:21,330
I don't even know where I saved this!

2244
01:19:21,890 --> 01:19:28,290
Oh, I saved it in behind the scenes, in my birthday, but this is my favorite.

2245
01:19:28,690 --> 01:19:30,010
I love this quote.

2246
01:19:30,590 --> 01:19:39,950
Uh, baby's face, baby's personality, baby's voice.

2247
01:19:43,170 --> 01:19:48,130
It's just like, Brokey doesn't, he doesn't even say anything!

2248
01:19:48,830 --> 01:19:52,310
He means, Brokey doesn't even have a personality!

2249
01:19:52,690 --> 01:19:54,370
What the fuck do you mean?

2250
01:19:54,370 --> 01:19:57,730
I, I, I don't know what that means.

2251
01:19:58,070 --> 01:19:59,830
What personality?

2252
01:20:00,570 --> 01:20:02,010
What do you mean?

2253
01:20:02,610 --> 01:20:03,970
What do you mean?

2254
01:20:04,890 --> 01:20:07,870
Um, he, he rapped.

2255
01:20:08,210 --> 01:20:15,270
He said, Gugu got, that one line was like, his entire, his, like, just says his life story.

2256
01:20:16,070 --> 01:20:21,290
Um, I just saw the Saja Lincoln, honestly, I get it!

2257
01:20:22,930 --> 01:20:25,790
They just have pretty privilege, it's not fair.

2258
01:20:26,170 --> 01:20:30,790
Also, um, I, um, I can finally, uh, I did the outline, guys.

2259
01:20:31,010 --> 01:20:32,770
I actually did the outline this time.

2260
01:20:32,970 --> 01:20:35,310
But, here are all the credits for everything.

2261
01:20:35,490 --> 01:20:37,410
I, I'm, I'm sorry if I missed any of the credits.

2262
01:20:37,410 --> 01:20:39,350
I've been, like, all over the place.

2263
01:20:42,310 --> 01:20:44,490
But, um, you guys didn't see it.

2264
01:20:44,610 --> 01:20:45,810
They're 3D animators.

2265
01:20:46,190 --> 01:20:49,290
Um, are the people I, I, I...

2266
01:20:49,290 --> 01:20:52,810
It's the same, probably gave them personality.

2267
01:20:53,010 --> 01:20:56,090
But they're all, like, they're archetypes!

2268
01:20:56,210 --> 01:20:57,970
That's the thing about K-pop.

2269
01:20:58,210 --> 01:21:06,010
Oh my god, one of my favorite comments about it was just like, It was just like, this is the entire, the movie is the opposite of the K-pop industry.

2270
01:21:06,270 --> 01:21:07,550
I wish the K-pop industry...

2271
01:21:07,550 --> 01:21:12,190
This is like, it's like, this is like, the idyllic version of the K-pop industry.

2272
01:21:12,190 --> 01:21:14,890
But it's like, the entire opposite of it.

2273
01:21:20,130 --> 01:21:22,810
Anyway, here are the credits.

2274
01:21:23,210 --> 01:21:24,510
So, the 3D animators.

2275
01:21:24,510 --> 01:21:31,330
Raman, Aikyo, Septets, uh, 3D rigger for some of the, uh, Dragoon models was Kani.

2276
01:21:31,550 --> 01:21:35,310
The sound-a-san, uh, who also did the beach episode, was Mr. Fox.

2277
01:21:35,810 --> 01:21:41,050
Uh, Chigo did the under-the-desk prop, where you saw, like, you know, the Dragoon was under the desk and everything.

2278
01:21:41,710 --> 01:21:45,310
Um, the K-pop industry, if it wasn't evil!

2279
01:21:46,710 --> 01:21:52,110
Yeah, I was just like, I was like, in what world is the K-pop industry, like, this...

2280
01:21:52,110 --> 01:21:55,550
Like, like, wow, they get to go on breaks?

2281
01:21:55,770 --> 01:21:56,530
What the fuck?

2282
01:21:56,750 --> 01:22:01,570
Like, Huntrix can actually go on break and eat whatever they want?

2283
01:22:02,050 --> 01:22:06,570
And, and, and meet their fans who are not fucking psychotic?

2284
01:22:06,990 --> 01:22:11,030
Like, where is the ethical K-pop?

2285
01:22:12,170 --> 01:22:13,870
They get to eat?

2286
01:22:14,470 --> 01:22:16,110
Like, the sad...

2287
01:22:19,350 --> 01:22:19,890
Um...

2288
01:22:20,830 --> 01:22:21,370
Anyway...

2289
01:22:22,050 --> 01:22:22,590
Uh...

2290
01:22:22,590 --> 01:22:23,330
Uh...

2291
01:22:23,330 --> 01:22:23,570
The...

2292
01:22:23,570 --> 01:22:24,110
The...

2293
01:22:24,630 --> 01:22:25,110
The...

2294
01:22:25,110 --> 01:22:25,950
Debut teaser...

2295
01:22:25,950 --> 01:22:29,230
Like I say, Reina did that in like, one to two days...

2296
01:22:29,230 --> 01:22:30,490
Like, in like two days...

2297
01:22:30,490 --> 01:22:34,390
And like, shout-out to Reina, because my mistake earlier.

2298
01:22:35,650 --> 01:22:36,190
Um...

2299
01:22:37,170 --> 01:22:37,710
Um...

2300
01:22:37,710 --> 01:22:38,310
Um...

2301
01:22:38,310 --> 01:22:38,630
Um...

2302
01:22:38,630 --> 01:22:41,710
My mom and papa, as you guys know, is Kamame and Sedia.

2303
01:22:41,710 --> 01:22:42,250
Uh...

2304
01:22:42,250 --> 01:22:42,990
The Isekai...

2305
01:22:42,990 --> 01:22:43,990
Isekai video...

2306
01:22:43,990 --> 01:22:44,450
Um...

2307
01:22:44,450 --> 01:22:46,430
In the middle, with like, the questions and everything.

2308
01:22:46,590 --> 01:22:47,870
And like, tomato guide.

2309
01:22:48,050 --> 01:22:48,930
I still...

2310
01:22:48,930 --> 01:22:49,910
I love this...

2311
01:22:49,910 --> 01:22:50,510
By the way, I'm sorry.

2312
01:22:50,670 --> 01:22:51,130
I'm gonna...

2313
01:22:51,610 --> 01:22:51,850
I...

2314
01:22:51,850 --> 01:22:51,990
I...

2315
01:22:51,990 --> 01:22:53,670
I love this picture I drew.

2316
01:22:55,110 --> 01:22:55,590
Um...

2317
01:22:57,090 --> 01:22:57,950
I don't know.

2318
01:22:58,090 --> 01:23:00,390
I was like, can we make it look like this?

2319
01:23:00,530 --> 01:23:02,090
And I love it!

2320
01:23:02,230 --> 01:23:04,550
I wanted it to be more godlike.

2321
01:23:04,550 --> 01:23:04,910
I...

2322
01:23:04,910 --> 01:23:06,030
I fucking love this.

2323
01:23:06,230 --> 01:23:07,950
And this being trying, I did.

2324
01:23:08,190 --> 01:23:08,670
I...

2325
01:23:08,670 --> 01:23:10,470
It's so good.

2326
01:23:12,190 --> 01:23:12,870
Anyway...

2327
01:23:12,870 --> 01:23:13,630
Um...

2328
01:23:13,630 --> 01:23:14,770
That was...

2329
01:23:15,890 --> 01:23:16,570
Um...

2330
01:23:16,570 --> 01:23:18,770
That was done by...

2331
01:23:18,770 --> 01:23:19,030
Uh...

2332
01:23:19,030 --> 01:23:19,490
Vermillion.

2333
01:23:19,770 --> 01:23:20,690
The wallpaper...

2334
01:23:20,690 --> 01:23:21,630
That's the free wallpaper.

2335
01:23:21,630 --> 01:23:23,570
That's based off the school outfit.

2336
01:23:24,070 --> 01:23:24,750
Um...

2337
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:25,910
It is by Salt.

2338
01:23:26,550 --> 01:23:26,890
Uh...

2339
01:23:27,210 --> 01:23:28,070
Dragoolin costume.

2340
01:23:28,210 --> 01:23:30,010
The reskin was, uh...

2341
01:23:30,010 --> 01:23:30,510
Um...

2342
01:23:30,510 --> 01:23:30,950
A3.

2343
01:23:31,370 --> 01:23:31,830
Uh...

2344
01:23:31,830 --> 01:23:36,470
The concert music and the mixing and the original song was by the Asteroid music team.

2345
01:23:36,470 --> 01:23:37,510
So I worked with them...

2346
01:23:38,010 --> 01:23:38,930
Quite often.

2347
01:23:39,370 --> 01:23:40,720
They've done a lot of stuff for me regarding...

2348
01:23:41,070 --> 01:23:41,550
Like...

2349
01:23:41,550 --> 01:23:41,790
I...

2350
01:23:41,790 --> 01:23:41,870
I...

2351
01:23:41,870 --> 01:23:43,810
They're basically my go-to...

2352
01:23:43,810 --> 01:23:46,470
Mixers for concerts and like...

2353
01:23:47,770 --> 01:23:48,270
Singing.

2354
01:23:48,450 --> 01:23:50,750
Because they're the ones that know how to make me...

2355
01:23:50,750 --> 01:23:51,510
Sound...

2356
01:23:51,510 --> 01:23:51,970
Like...

2357
01:23:51,970 --> 01:23:53,670
Not a fucking...

2358
01:23:53,670 --> 01:23:54,370
Dying bird.

2359
01:23:54,370 --> 01:23:55,170
So...

2360
01:23:55,170 --> 01:23:55,610
Hahahaha.

2361
01:23:56,890 --> 01:23:57,150
Hahahaha.

2362
01:23:57,410 --> 01:23:58,910
They've done a lot of music stuff.

2363
01:23:59,030 --> 01:24:00,370
They've done a lot of music stuff for like...

2364
01:24:00,370 --> 01:24:01,590
A lot of different companies.

2365
01:24:01,650 --> 01:24:02,430
And a lot of...

2366
01:24:02,430 --> 01:24:03,230
Actual...

2367
01:24:03,230 --> 01:24:03,670
Singers.

2368
01:24:03,910 --> 01:24:04,370
So...

2369
01:24:04,370 --> 01:24:06,510
I'm really thankful that they worked with me...

2370
01:24:06,890 --> 01:24:07,330
Uh...

2371
01:24:07,330 --> 01:24:08,590
On things whenever they can.

2372
01:24:09,190 --> 01:24:09,470
Um...

2373
01:24:09,470 --> 01:24:10,950
The thumbnail was done by...

2374
01:24:10,950 --> 01:24:12,550
For the concert was done by Fluffy Cat.

2375
01:24:12,610 --> 01:24:13,910
Which you can also get as a free wallpaper!

2376
01:24:14,290 --> 01:24:17,710
And then the concert logo was done by Magical Manny.

2377
01:24:17,710 --> 01:24:20,610
So yeah, those are everybody that worked on it.

2378
01:24:20,670 --> 01:24:21,510
I really appreciate it.

2379
01:24:21,570 --> 01:24:22,410
Thank you guys so much.

2380
01:24:22,610 --> 01:24:22,770
Alright.

2381
01:24:24,090 --> 01:24:24,890
Oh my gosh.

2382
01:24:26,030 --> 01:24:28,850
Oh my god, this has been like a four hour birthday stream.

2383
01:24:28,990 --> 01:24:29,190
Wow.

2384
01:24:34,070 --> 01:24:36,530
I just want to say again, thank you guys again.

2385
01:24:37,490 --> 01:24:38,970
There were so many gifts and stuff.

2386
01:24:39,070 --> 01:24:41,110
I just saw someone made a game and everything.

2387
01:24:41,330 --> 01:24:44,610
And they made a little board for a kudo board.

2388
01:24:44,710 --> 01:24:45,490
I think that's what they're called.

2389
01:24:45,490 --> 01:24:47,230
Or like messages from the fans.

2390
01:24:47,390 --> 01:24:48,010
Thank you guys so much.

2391
01:24:48,130 --> 01:24:49,290
And there was like videos and stuff.

2392
01:24:49,670 --> 01:24:50,770
Thank you guys so much.

2393
01:24:51,310 --> 01:24:53,090
I really appreciate it, guys.

2394
01:24:53,330 --> 01:24:59,570
For like all the work and like the amazing stuff you've drawn and given me.

2395
01:24:59,790 --> 01:25:00,550
Thank you guys.

2396
01:25:00,550 --> 01:25:03,490
I saw like a game too where it was based on Suika.

2397
01:25:03,730 --> 01:25:06,570
But it was basically me and like the Dokiverse.

2398
01:25:07,190 --> 01:25:08,410
So thank you guys.

2399
01:25:08,410 --> 01:25:09,790
I really appreciate it.

2400
01:25:10,010 --> 01:25:15,150
Alright, before we go, let's make a birthday wish together.

2401
01:25:15,150 --> 01:25:16,310
Let's blow out the candle.

2402
01:25:18,350 --> 01:25:24,670
So this candle is more so of like those, you know, like the ones where it's like...

2403
01:25:26,570 --> 01:25:27,890
Where it doesn't go out.

2404
01:25:31,550 --> 01:25:34,270
That's the candle that we're going to have to deal with today.

2405
01:25:37,070 --> 01:25:38,330
Wait, let me double check.

2406
01:25:38,490 --> 01:25:39,150
Maybe I can...

2407
01:25:40,110 --> 01:25:41,690
Oh, let me double check.

2408
01:25:42,310 --> 01:25:42,870
Oh, yeah.

2409
01:25:43,010 --> 01:25:43,190
Alright.

2410
01:25:43,630 --> 01:25:44,550
So, yes.

2411
01:25:44,670 --> 01:25:45,890
This is like the electric ones.

2412
01:25:46,030 --> 01:25:48,310
Yeah, the electric ones, you know, that don't go out.

2413
01:25:48,470 --> 01:25:49,330
So we're going to...

2414
01:25:49,330 --> 01:25:51,910
Because I'm not allowed near fire for a while.

2415
01:25:53,770 --> 01:25:54,130
Okay.

2416
01:25:54,550 --> 01:25:57,150
I actually accidentally smoke detected.

2417
01:25:58,370 --> 01:25:59,590
Triggered the smoke detection.

2418
01:25:59,950 --> 01:26:01,390
Because I was trying to...

2419
01:26:01,390 --> 01:26:02,430
What was I trying to make?

2420
01:26:02,970 --> 01:26:04,030
I was trying to make something.

2421
01:26:04,030 --> 01:26:08,390
And then, like, accidentally triggered the smoke detector.

2422
01:26:09,330 --> 01:26:10,290
Because, like...

2423
01:26:10,290 --> 01:26:11,070
I don't know.

2424
01:26:11,270 --> 01:26:12,290
I don't know what I did.

2425
01:26:12,550 --> 01:26:14,770
Oh, I forgot to turn on the fan inside.

2426
01:26:14,990 --> 01:26:15,530
I forgot...

2427
01:26:15,530 --> 01:26:15,910
I don't know.

2428
01:26:16,090 --> 01:26:17,210
I don't know how ovens work.

2429
01:26:18,190 --> 01:26:20,270
I don't know how ovens work.

2430
01:26:20,470 --> 01:26:22,490
Let's make a birthday wish before we go.

2431
01:26:23,250 --> 01:26:25,690
Because it's been a long Doki day.

2432
01:26:26,930 --> 01:26:27,410
Alright.

2433
01:26:27,690 --> 01:26:29,170
Let's make a wish together, okay?

2434
01:26:30,850 --> 01:26:32,450
I'll give you guys a countdown.

2435
01:26:33,230 --> 01:26:33,670
Alright?

2436
01:26:34,270 --> 01:26:35,490
Okay, we gotta close our eyes.

2437
01:26:36,110 --> 01:26:37,330
Gotta close our eyes, okay?

2438
01:26:37,950 --> 01:26:39,570
You can't see what you guys are talking about.

2439
01:26:40,210 --> 01:26:41,650
Alright, but think of a wish...

2440
01:26:41,650 --> 01:26:43,350
That you really, really want to make.

2441
01:26:44,210 --> 01:26:44,690
Alright.

2442
01:26:47,710 --> 01:26:48,190
Three.

2443
01:26:49,790 --> 01:26:51,470
And then we blow this candle out together.

2444
01:26:52,950 --> 01:26:53,430
Three.

2445
01:26:55,150 --> 01:26:55,630
Two.

2446
01:26:56,790 --> 01:26:57,270
One.

2447
01:26:59,170 --> 01:26:59,270
One.

2448
01:27:02,070 --> 01:27:03,430
Candle's still going because it's electrical.

2449
01:27:07,950 --> 01:27:09,750
Now, what was your birthday wish, guys?

2450
01:27:11,990 --> 01:27:12,850
What was it?

2451
01:27:25,850 --> 01:27:26,690
Oh, you know.

2452
01:27:26,970 --> 01:27:29,190
I was trying to make sure your wishes don't come true.

2453
01:27:30,110 --> 01:27:30,970
Because you told me.

2454
01:27:30,970 --> 01:27:31,730
I was going to be like, Ha!

2455
01:27:31,810 --> 01:27:32,490
You told me!

2456
01:27:32,490 --> 01:27:34,070
So, now...

2457
01:27:34,070 --> 01:27:35,550
Now your wish will not come true.

2458
01:27:35,930 --> 01:27:37,350
Aw, I can't fool you guys again.

2459
01:27:37,630 --> 01:27:38,850
I can't trick you guys again.

2460
01:27:39,030 --> 01:27:40,350
Because there are more wishes for me.

2461
01:27:40,450 --> 01:27:40,910
That means...

2462
01:27:40,910 --> 01:27:43,650
The less your wishes come true, The more likely mine will.

2463
01:27:45,050 --> 01:27:46,530
No, I can't tell.

2464
01:27:46,530 --> 01:27:48,790
My crows is thinking with the super chat.

2465
01:27:48,970 --> 01:27:49,290
Thank you.

2466
01:27:49,450 --> 01:27:50,050
Thank you.

2467
01:27:51,190 --> 01:27:51,830
I don't know.

2468
01:27:51,890 --> 01:27:53,110
I thought you guys might have forgot.

2469
01:27:53,570 --> 01:27:54,370
I don't fucking know.

2470
01:27:54,810 --> 01:27:55,370
Anyway, guys.

2471
01:27:55,590 --> 01:27:56,610
Thank you guys again.

2472
01:27:58,090 --> 01:28:00,850
For celebrating my birthday with me.

2473
01:28:01,290 --> 01:28:02,130
Like I said.

2474
01:28:02,490 --> 01:28:03,610
You guys, right in my day.

2475
01:28:03,790 --> 01:28:04,650
Every time I stream.

2476
01:28:04,970 --> 01:28:06,050
Or like, every day, basically.

2477
01:28:06,830 --> 01:28:08,430
This is a crazy career to have.

2478
01:28:08,670 --> 01:28:09,550
Like, you know.

2479
01:28:09,550 --> 01:28:11,630
I'm very fortunate to have this career.

2480
01:28:12,970 --> 01:28:16,650
I'm very happy that I'm gonna be less stressed now.

2481
01:28:18,390 --> 01:28:20,330
I'm happy that I'm gonna be less tired.

2482
01:28:20,610 --> 01:28:21,650
Less stressed.

2483
01:28:21,950 --> 01:28:23,450
And less overwhelmed.

2484
01:28:23,970 --> 01:28:25,530
Now that all of this is over.

2485
01:28:27,010 --> 01:28:28,470
Now all, you know.

2486
01:28:28,670 --> 01:28:29,410
Like, concert.

2487
01:28:29,930 --> 01:28:31,330
And birthday prep.

2488
01:28:31,370 --> 01:28:32,350
And all that stuff.

2489
01:28:32,350 --> 01:28:33,370
It's finally over.

2490
01:28:33,610 --> 01:28:34,490
So, I'm happy.

2491
01:28:35,910 --> 01:28:37,330
No longer a little stress ball.

2492
01:28:37,390 --> 01:28:38,110
That's something I wanna make.

2493
01:28:38,110 --> 01:28:39,050
I wanna make a stress ball.

2494
01:28:39,370 --> 01:28:40,890
I wanna make that.

2495
01:28:41,210 --> 01:28:41,690
Oh, yeah.

2496
01:28:43,010 --> 01:28:43,790
Funny story.

2497
01:28:44,110 --> 01:28:45,170
Gamers, those people were like.

2498
01:28:45,370 --> 01:28:46,290
So, we all know like.

2499
01:28:46,410 --> 01:28:47,610
What you want is like.

2500
01:28:47,910 --> 01:28:49,430
Priority merch for us to make.

2501
01:28:49,730 --> 01:28:51,770
Because you always say you want all of this.

2502
01:28:51,870 --> 01:28:52,650
Like, priority.

2503
01:28:53,030 --> 01:28:54,690
But if everything is priority.

2504
01:28:55,030 --> 01:28:55,450
Then like.

2505
01:28:55,590 --> 01:28:56,670
That defeats the purpose.

2506
01:28:56,950 --> 01:28:57,730
Oh, my God.

2507
01:28:59,350 --> 01:29:00,190
Because I was like.

2508
01:29:00,270 --> 01:29:01,910
I want you to make this.

2509
01:29:02,050 --> 01:29:02,590
And I want.

2510
01:29:03,130 --> 01:29:05,790
But I keep saying that for every idea I have.

2511
01:29:05,930 --> 01:29:06,550
So, they're like.

2512
01:29:06,710 --> 01:29:06,990
Okay.

2513
01:29:06,990 --> 01:29:07,970
We really need you.

2514
01:29:08,110 --> 01:29:08,650
To like.

2515
01:29:09,830 --> 01:29:10,430
To actually.

2516
01:29:10,750 --> 01:29:10,930
Like.

2517
01:29:11,730 --> 01:29:11,750
Um.

2518
01:29:12,050 --> 01:29:13,110
Put it in order.

2519
01:29:13,270 --> 01:29:14,030
On which one.

2520
01:29:14,210 --> 01:29:15,830
Is actually priority.

2521
01:29:16,690 --> 01:29:17,130
Anything.

2522
01:29:17,930 --> 01:29:18,370
So.

2523
01:29:18,610 --> 01:29:20,310
Because we can't make it all priority.

2524
01:29:23,450 --> 01:29:25,110
If everything is important.

2525
01:29:25,210 --> 01:29:26,070
Nothing is.

2526
01:29:26,530 --> 01:29:26,610
Uh.

2527
01:29:26,810 --> 01:29:27,430
Oh, no.

2528
01:29:27,590 --> 01:29:28,110
Thank God.

2529
01:29:28,250 --> 01:29:28,390
Huh.

2530
01:29:28,690 --> 01:29:30,230
So, I gotta figure it out.

2531
01:29:30,370 --> 01:29:32,110
What I actually wanna make first.

2532
01:29:32,510 --> 01:29:32,670
Um.

2533
01:29:32,770 --> 01:29:33,890
The one thing I do wanna make first.

2534
01:29:33,970 --> 01:29:34,250
Is that.

2535
01:29:34,310 --> 01:29:35,330
The miniature plushies.

2536
01:29:35,410 --> 01:29:35,550
You know.

2537
01:29:35,550 --> 01:29:36,450
I don't know.

2538
01:29:36,550 --> 01:29:37,450
Did I show any members?

2539
01:29:37,670 --> 01:29:38,730
Or did I show it to you guys publicly?

2540
01:29:39,130 --> 01:29:40,010
I don't remember.

2541
01:29:40,270 --> 01:29:40,290
I.

2542
01:29:40,430 --> 01:29:40,850
Because like.

2543
01:29:41,210 --> 01:29:43,090
Everything's been blurring together for me.

2544
01:29:43,430 --> 01:29:44,630
But did I show the.

2545
01:29:45,450 --> 01:29:46,450
The little like.

2546
01:29:46,630 --> 01:29:47,730
The little tiny ones.

2547
01:29:48,230 --> 01:29:49,850
Did I show it to the members?

2548
01:29:49,850 --> 01:29:50,710
Or non-members?

2549
01:29:50,850 --> 01:29:51,390
It was members?

2550
01:29:51,550 --> 01:29:51,750
Okay.

2551
01:29:51,750 --> 01:29:52,650
I feel.

2552
01:29:53,030 --> 01:29:53,850
I feel.

2553
01:29:53,990 --> 01:29:55,350
I feel generous today.

2554
01:29:57,010 --> 01:29:58,370
I need to find the.

2555
01:29:58,570 --> 01:29:59,050
The little.

2556
01:29:59,310 --> 01:29:59,870
The little.

2557
01:30:00,050 --> 01:30:00,750
The little plushies.

2558
01:30:01,030 --> 01:30:01,670
The papa papa.

2559
01:30:02,370 --> 01:30:02,630
Um.

2560
01:30:04,350 --> 01:30:05,370
Ba-dum-bum.

2561
01:30:06,150 --> 01:30:07,570
Ba-da-da-dum-bum.

2562
01:30:07,570 --> 01:30:08,390
Oh, here it is.

2563
01:30:09,090 --> 01:30:09,710

2564
01:30:09,930 --> 01:30:11,070
I'll show it to you guys.

2565
01:30:11,670 --> 01:30:11,990
So.

2566
01:30:12,090 --> 01:30:12,470
This is.

2567
01:30:12,610 --> 01:30:13,230
This one is.

2568
01:30:13,310 --> 01:30:14,570
I'm putting this in priority.

2569
01:30:14,850 --> 01:30:16,350
Because I thought it'd be really cute.

2570
01:30:17,050 --> 01:30:17,350
Um.

2571
01:30:18,970 --> 01:30:19,370
But.

2572
01:30:20,390 --> 01:30:20,790
Uh.

2573
01:30:21,490 --> 01:30:22,030
The sweat.

2574
01:30:22,670 --> 01:30:23,030
The little.

2575
01:30:23,210 --> 01:30:24,050
Those little ones.

2576
01:30:24,190 --> 01:30:25,230
The really tiny ones.

2577
01:30:25,770 --> 01:30:26,410
And then.

2578
01:30:26,850 --> 01:30:27,050
Uh.

2579
01:30:27,370 --> 01:30:28,050
And then there's like.

2580
01:30:28,150 --> 01:30:28,690
They're gonna be.

2581
01:30:28,810 --> 01:30:29,870
They have like the little hoodies.

2582
01:30:29,870 --> 01:30:30,710
They can wear too.

2583
01:30:31,130 --> 01:30:32,390
So they can wear like.

2584
01:30:32,530 --> 01:30:33,870
These little hoodies and stuff.

2585
01:30:34,210 --> 01:30:34,690
And everything.

2586
01:30:35,090 --> 01:30:35,490
So like.

2587
01:30:35,590 --> 01:30:36,690
There's like a dad elf.

2588
01:30:36,850 --> 01:30:37,190
So like.

2589
01:30:37,210 --> 01:30:37,850
You can put this on.

2590
01:30:37,930 --> 01:30:38,030
Yeah.

2591
01:30:38,170 --> 01:30:38,230
The.

2592
01:30:38,590 --> 01:30:38,850
Yeah.

2593
01:30:38,950 --> 01:30:39,910
They the 10 to 12.

2594
01:30:40,090 --> 01:30:40,270
Yeah.

2595
01:30:40,350 --> 01:30:40,470
Yeah.

2596
01:30:40,570 --> 01:30:40,850
They are.

2597
01:30:41,030 --> 01:30:41,970
So you can like.

2598
01:30:42,430 --> 01:30:43,130
Grip them.

2599
01:30:44,230 --> 01:30:45,090
I don't know how.

2600
01:30:45,510 --> 01:30:46,130
You can.

2601
01:30:46,430 --> 01:30:47,330
You can grip it.

2602
01:30:52,430 --> 01:30:56,050
And then you can put these little hoodies on your other plushies, too.

2603
01:30:56,570 --> 01:30:58,550
So that was the plan.

2604
01:30:58,830 --> 01:31:01,490
You can have little hoodies that you can put on the other ones.

2605
01:31:01,850 --> 01:31:04,790
And then you can have a collection of them, too.

2606
01:31:04,950 --> 01:31:06,030
You have three of them.

2607
01:31:06,190 --> 01:31:11,690
So two of them can wear each of the... Grip it, twist it, bop it.

2608
01:31:13,530 --> 01:31:14,690
Grasp firmly.

2609
01:31:14,690 --> 01:31:19,970
You know the meme where it's just the head popping out of the fist?

2610
01:31:22,490 --> 01:31:25,430
That's a priority that I'm making.

2611
01:31:26,170 --> 01:31:29,010
But yeah, I hope you guys love all the little gifts.

2612
01:31:31,150 --> 01:31:32,870
The outfit reveal.

2613
01:31:33,710 --> 01:31:36,150
I wish I could give you guys more.

2614
01:31:38,850 --> 01:31:42,750
Usually I'd make a little special gift for you guys.

2615
01:31:42,750 --> 01:31:45,350
Or like another special announcement or something.

2616
01:31:45,970 --> 01:31:51,230
But I do hope you guys enjoyed what I did today.

2617
01:31:51,610 --> 01:31:53,770
What I did for my birthday for you guys, you know.

2618
01:31:54,290 --> 01:31:56,690
I had a lot of fun with me and everything.

But thank you all for coming!

2620
01:31:59,470 --> 01:32:00,670
I really appreciate it!

01:32:00,750 --> 01:32:01,270
Thank you!

2622
01:32:02,770 --> 01:32:04,390
I'm gonna call it here, everyone.

2623
01:32:05,010 --> 01:32:06,710
Thank you all for the birthday wishes.

2624
01:32:07,090 --> 01:32:11,490
Like I said, I wouldn't have been able to do all of this without you guys.

2625
01:32:11,490 --> 01:32:14,630
This is actually like a dream job for me.

2626
01:32:15,870 --> 01:32:17,630
I don't know how long it's gonna last.

2627
01:32:17,630 --> 01:32:22,030
But I hope I can do this for a while.

2628
01:32:25,630 --> 01:32:28,110
Anyway, thank you all for being here.

2629
01:32:28,270 --> 01:32:31,470
And for spending your time with me for my birthday!

2630
01:32:32,030 --> 01:32:34,250
And through all the super chats, all the members.

2631
01:32:34,630 --> 01:32:36,830
All the memberships, all the super chats.

2632
01:32:37,030 --> 01:32:39,010
All the donations.

2633
01:32:39,570 --> 01:32:41,830
All the subscriptions and everything.

2634
01:32:41,830 --> 01:32:45,110
I don't think I'm gonna get a million subscribers by the end of the year.

2635
01:32:45,230 --> 01:32:48,210
But let's try and make it as close as it can be, okay guys?

2636
01:32:49,090 --> 01:32:51,950
And as always everybody, stay hydrated.

2637
01:32:52,530 --> 01:32:53,210
Posture check.

2638
01:32:53,490 --> 01:32:54,370
Get up and move around.

2639
01:32:54,550 --> 01:32:55,570
Get that blood flowing.

2640
01:32:55,750 --> 01:32:58,350
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

2641
01:32:58,550 --> 01:33:00,350
Cause you deserve it.

2642
01:33:00,630 --> 01:33:01,930
I'll see you guys next time.

2643
01:33:02,070 --> 01:33:02,630
Oh wait, tomorrow!

2644
01:33:03,450 --> 01:33:04,890
I'll see you guys next time everybody!

2645
01:33:05,850 --> 01:33:06,650
Bye guys!

2646
01:33:07,990 --> 01:33:08,390
Bye!
