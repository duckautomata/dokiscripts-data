1
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,020
Hello, hello, everybody.

2
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,100
Hello, hello.

3
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:58,340
I'm gonna mute the game music for now because I have some updates for you guys, as always, in the beginning of the stream.

4
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,220
But hello, everyone.

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,320
Today, so I'm waiting for the aircon to, like, get into this room, into my sauna right now.

6
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:13,420
So I'm having trouble breathing because, like, it's really hot in my enclosed area with no windows.

7
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,560
So I'm waiting for it.

8
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:24,040
I'm waiting for the aircon to hit this room right now because it's really hot right now in this room.

9
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,660
But yes, no, it's not a greenhouse.

10
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,860
There's no windows in this confined area.

11
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,960
So there's no circulation.

12
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:38,340
And yeah, so that was my biggest issue, putting my office in here.

13
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,600
But anyway, some updates.

14
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,120
Okay, so I'll get the bad news out of the way first.

15
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,880
I was, like, not crying about it, but I was like, wait a minute.

16
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,340
But if you guys didn't know, I'm gonna be in the XQC Invitational tomorrow.

17
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,380
That's gonna be starting at 12 p.m.

18
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,500
Um, it is a draft...

19
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,520
It's not bad news.

20
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,260
I was like, wait a minute.

21
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,960
So I was thinking this tournament pretty chill.

22
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:19,980
But then, like, um, more details came out as, like, the days went on.

23
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,940
It's a draft pick.

24
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,680
So each captain gets to pick who they want to be on their team.

25
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,680
So it's, like, snake draft.

26
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:38,840
So if you guys know what the snake draft format is, um, uh, that's basically, like, uh, it's basically each captain picks one, one, one, one, and then it goes up and down, up and down.

27
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,740
And so here are the team captains.

28
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,580
I'll get to the, the, like, really scary news later.

29
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:52,560
So, like, the team captains are XQC, Shroud, Necros, Super, Tens, and Summit.

30
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,600
So, um, I think I'm the only VTuber in here because there's a lot of big streamers in this invitational.

31
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,520
Um, including Tyler1 is in this tournament, you guys.

32
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:02,860
Whoa.

33
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,560
I don't know which team I'm gonna get in.

34
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:15,080
But there's a lot of really big names in this tournament, including Tyler1.

35
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:23,440
Um, yeah, um, but the Witch Summit, Summit 1G, I'm pretty sure it's, uh, I mean, that's the only summit I know.

36
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:38,940
Um, but, yeah, so, um, the scary thing about this tournament was that I thought it was just gonna be, like, ex-pros and, like, streamers, but then, um, Shroud's pro team is also in this tournament.

37
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,500
Um, like, you know, all six of them.

38
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,100
So, like, I was like, oh, wait a minute.

39
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,740
I think they're the only pro players in this tournament.

40
00:04:53,020 --> 00:05:02,220
Um, so, like, uh, so, it gets a little scarier because, um, if you guys didn't know, it is a 250k tournament.

41
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:13,820
So, um, um, and, um, first place is, I believe, first place is, oh my gosh, let me look.

42
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:17,360
Like, I know the prize distribution was, like, basically, each person gets 20k.

43
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,000
If you win first place.

44
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,000
Uh, uh,

45
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,880
let's see, 125.

46
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,900
Oh, yeah, yeah, each person gets 20k if they win first place.

47
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,520
And the second place was, like, 50k.

48
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:46,180
So, yeah, it's, like, it's scary because, like, there's actual players participating that have never played Rivals before and are starting, like, this week.

49
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,880
Like, there's an actual chess player.

50
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,800
I was, like, checking everybody else because I was, like, oh, it's interesting.

51
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,100
And I was, like, checking all the people that are in this tournament.

52
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,380
And there's, like, an actual chess streamer in this tournament.

53
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,460
And...

54
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,360
And I was, like, I was, like, oh, man.

55
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,800
I feel bad whenever...

56
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,000
If they have to...

57
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:17,160
If they are not in the team with any of the ShroudX players, I'd feel bad for them.

58
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:27,120
So, and then, like, I was talking to one of my friends and they're, like, oh, well, there's six of them.

59
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,500
So, like, one of them will be on your team.

60
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,400
But I was, like, you don't understand.

61
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:46,600
Like, it doesn't matter because the team that gets the pro DPS player is obviously gonna do better than the team that's gonna get the support pro player.

62
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,300
Like, I was, like, what the fuck is he gonna do?

63
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,240
Like, the support player is gonna do.

64
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,780
Like, I've seen tournaments.

65
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,560
Those support players still die to the pro DPS players.

66
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,480
Even when they're getting protected by their pro team.

67
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,100
You think, like...

68
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,400
So, so, it's, like, there's a pot...

69
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,820
Like, so, yeah, it's, like, I was, like, yeah.

70
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:16,540
And I don't know if you guys know, but, like, Nekros has been trying to do this thing.

71
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,420
Where, um...

72
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:26,720
Uh, Nekros is trying to do this thing where he's trying to prove to everybody that support players are, like, complaining too much.

73
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,820
But he's, like, hard-stuck GM right now.

74
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,560
So, he's been...

75
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,500
He's been...

76
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,460
And he's, like...

77
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:36,480
He's been streaming for, like, like, 10 plus hours today.

78
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,900
Oh, he's still going.

79
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:38,700
Oh, yeah.

80
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,880
Wait, he's still going.

81
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,480
So, he's been, like, crashing out incredibly hard.

82
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,080
And...

83
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,020
Yeah.

84
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,140
Um...

85
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:50,400
He's been, like, crashing out really hard right now.

86
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,600
Because he said that he was going to get Celestial today.

87
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:57,280
And he's sort of been, like, hard-stuck GM, like, for the last...

88
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,860
I believe, like...

89
00:07:59,380 --> 00:07:59,860
Uh...

90
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:00,640
12 hours.

91
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,000
Sorry.

92
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:01,400
He's...

93
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:01,740
Sorry.

94
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:02,680
I miscalculated.

95
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,420
12 hours right now?

96
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,240
And he was...

97
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,060
It was so funny because I caught his stream.

98
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,880
And he was, like...

99
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,940
Was saying how, like...

100
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,900
How can I lose this much...

101
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,740
This many points when my DPS was doing absolutely nothing?

102
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:19,780
I don't deserve to lose that many points for the stuff I was doing.

103
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,120
And then all his chat was, like...

104
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,660
Oh, now you understand.

105
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,480
Like...

106
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:29,860
Like...

107
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,560
And the people in his chat were, like...

108
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,900
Wait, are you rage baiting?

109
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,680
Or are you, like, for real right now?

110
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,920
And he was legitimately, like...

111
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,840
Crashing out.

112
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:41,880
And, like...

113
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,820
Understanding the pain now.

114
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:44,780
Like...

115
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,080
Yeah.

116
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,000
Um...

117
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,300
Yeah.

118
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,300
So, like...

119
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:53,920
It's actually...

120
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,820
It was pretty silly.

121
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:55,580
Uh...

122
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,080
But, like...

123
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,280
Yeah.

124
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:56,980
So...

125
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,300
I'm a little...

126
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:02,540
After the stream, I'm gonna be practicing my four rivals.

127
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,240
Because...

128
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,040
Um...

129
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,660
But...

130
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,260
If I somehow get it...

131
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:06,740
If I...

132
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:09,020
My RNG is incredibly bad.

133
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,780
And, like...

134
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,160
Um...

135
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,900
If my RNG is incredibly bad with, like...

136
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,240
Uh...

137
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,240
I know that, like...

138
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:15,940
We might not...

139
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,600
We might struggle.

140
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,800
I'm gonna take the tournament as...

141
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,300
For fun.

142
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,100
During that day.

143
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:21,680
But...

144
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,760
Today, I'm definitely practicing rivals tonight.

145
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,920
I won't be streaming it.

146
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,460
But I will be practicing.

147
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,540
I have not been playing a lot of my...

148
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,660
I will have to admit.

149
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,620
I've not been playing as much as I should be.

150
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,100
Because I didn't realize...

151
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,640
I didn't...

152
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,480
I didn't realize what the competition was like.

153
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,580
But...

154
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,720
But...

155
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,340
Um...

156
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:42,940
If...

157
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,400
During the day of...

158
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,040
Tomorrow...

159
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,000
Because, like...

160
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,760
We find out which teams...

161
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,420
Um...

162
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:53,060
Which teams we're gonna be in tomorrow because they're doing the draft pick like live on stream.

163
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,380
Well, not my stream, obviously on their own streams.

164
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,380
But they're doing the draft pick like live on the day.

165
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:04,940
So like if I realize, okay, like, you know, might not be like, you know, it's not winnable.

166
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,180
I'm not gonna like, you know, be like, and I'll be like, okay, I'll just do it for the vibes.

167
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:20,600
Just be like, I'll have fun, use it as like a way to get to know people on my team, like get to like networking thing, and then just use it as that.

168
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:29,180
And then, but like, but if my team is like full on try hard, I gotta make sure that like I pick up the slack for my team.

169
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,300
Because I think I'm like the only VTuber that's invited for this tournament.

170
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,580
And there's a lot of big names in this tournament.

171
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,500
Like Sweet Anita's in it.

172
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:44,740
If you guys who don't know who Sweet Anita it is, um, she's the, uh, the one with the tick.

173
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,760
Um, I don't remember what it was called again.

174
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:51,420
Uh, uh, I forgot what the, the thing is called.

175
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,780
Yeah, she's like a really sweet person.

176
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,500
Yeah, but she's in the tournament as well.

177
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,420
There's a lot of like, um, I think, I don't remember the, uh, Tourette's.

178
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,760
Yeah, she's the one with the Tourette's.

179
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:06,020
Um, and had like, uh, was like really big on that, uh, on Twitch a couple of years ago.

180
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,900
Yeah, yeah, Sweet Anita's in it.

181
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:13,620
And like I said, the captains are literally XTC, Shroud, Necro, Super, Tens, Summit, 1G.

182
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:18,420
Um, there's like, uh, like Fortnite people might recognize some of these names.

183
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:22,680
There's like Thieves, um, there's, uh, Raffle Waffles.

184
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:30,440
I was like telling my friend, I was like, oh, hey, I don't know who these people are, but there's like some non-rival, like non-rivals players, like non-FPS players in here.

185
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,900
And Mr. Raffle Waffles.

186
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,760
And then my friend was like, oh my god, the Call of Duty Easter egg person?

187
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,460
I was like, I don't know, he has, he, yeah, he's like the COD zombies guy.

188
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,400
Yeah, apparently.

189
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,140
And then, uh, and then there's a chess person too.

190
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,000
Um, I mean, there's the usual Overwatch, yeah, from the zombies walkthrough.

191
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,020
Yeah, he's in it.

192
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,140
He's also in it.

193
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,980
There's a lot of like Fortnite streamers in here too.

194
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,860
Like really big Fortnite streamers.

195
00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:00,840
Um, I have no idea who they are, but I was curious, you know, I was curious.

196
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,400
I wanted to like, I looked at them.

197
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,680
I was like, oh, who are these people?

198
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,180
Um, I forgot which one's the chess person.

199
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,280
I need to look through everything, uh, to find the chess guy.

200
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,840
But like, there was a chess streamer in here too.

201
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:17,980
Um, but yeah, and then like, and then there's ShroudX's entire roster.

202
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,280
I don't, I don't know how, it's like draft pick, so each person's gonna be on a different team.

203
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,540
But like, who are we kidding ourselves?

204
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:30,720
I don't know how much the tank and DPS player would definitely have more value.

205
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:34,700
Because like, um, at least they can kill people.

206
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,380
I'm sorry, as a support player.

207
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:45,800
I know my value is a lot less than a DPS and tank player and like, we're not fooling anyone.

208
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:59,400
So, the two teams that might, unfortunately, um, might not be able to get the DPS and tank players, um, will be like, we might struggle a little bit.

209
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,380
Uh, especially because they're active pros.

210
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,680
Like, they're literally doing fight night right now.

211
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,840
Like, they're participating in a pro tournament at the moment.

212
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:17,320
No, as a fellow support player, I, I can only do so much, you know?

213
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:25,080
I can, I can only do as much as I can to enable my team and do the damage I can.

214
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:31,480
Um, but I am very thankful to be invited.

215
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:41,340
Um, because like I said, it is a, like, a huge, like, it basically, like, it's a lot of, like, anyone who's anybody on Twitch is sort of, like, in this tournament.

216
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,600
Literally, Tyler1 is in this tournament.

217
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,980
I, this would be my, I, I don't know.

218
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:51,260
I told my friends, I was like, I hope I get on a team with Tyler1.

219
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:55,500
Like, like, we're gonna lose, but, like, it would be so fucking fun.

220
00:13:55,780 --> 00:14:01,020
Like, I think, I think it'd be really fun to be on a team with Tyler1.

221
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:05,480
I don't think we'll make it far, but I just think it'd be pretty fun.

222
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,560
I just think.

223
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,080
Yeah, Tyler1, the chess play, exactly.

224
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,220
Um, but we'll see, uh, we'll see how it goes.

225
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:20,240
Um, we might have a team that we might not know a lot of the people.

226
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:27,340
We might have the team who's like, I mean, the captains, the, the, all the captains are, like, really well-known streamers as well.

227
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,800
Um, like I said, the captains are XUC, Shrouds, Necros, Super, Tense, and Summit.

228
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:41,080
So, like, all of them are, like, um, really well, if anything, like, the captains are really well-known, uh, individuals as well in their own right on Twitch.

229
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:46,160
Um, so it'd be, like, you know, a great opportunity, especially if I'm, like, the only VTuber in here.

230
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,020
Um, and, yeah, I'm super excited tomorrow.

231
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,040
I hope it's not awkward.

232
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,420
Oh, God, I hope so, too.

233
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,000
I hope, I hope if we lose that it won't be too awkward.

234
00:14:59,500 --> 00:14:59,980
I...

235
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,600
Oh, yeah.

236
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:11,100
Um, but, yeah, anyway, so that's, I got the, the little bit of, like, oh, shit, I gotta practice tonight.

237
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,840
Um, cause, I mean, I'm Celestia 3 right now, which is, like, not bad.

238
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,000
I also haven't played a lot to be Celestia 3.

239
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:28,120
So, I feel like if I was playing consistently, I would obviously be a lot higher rank, But I haven't really played that much this season.

240
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:31,680
Because Dive Meta... Captain America Meta fucking sucks.

241
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,340
I'll say it.

242
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,500
I really do not enjoy Captain America Meta.

243
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,620
Like... I was fine when it was just regular Dive.

244
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,060
When it's Venom Spider.

245
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:44,860
But the Captain America is so fucking oppressive.

246
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,540
The Captain America Meta is incredibly oppressive.

247
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,760
It's more oppressive than Spider-Man and...

248
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,600
Venom.

249
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,040
I hate it much more.

250
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,560
He just does... At least Venom can die.

251
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:05,700
A good Captain America cannot fucking die.

252
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,320
So... Oh, hey.

253
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,160
Necros lost another support game.

254
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:10,720
Wow.

255
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,820
I'm not hate-watching, guys.

256
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,740
I'm just, like, trying to see if he wins this.

257
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,520
I was curious.

258
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:24,260
I... I just thought it was... I thought he was really funny when he, like...

259
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,620
Finally understood.

260
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:26,800
Like... Oh, wait.

261
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:27,200
Wait.

262
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,000
They might win.

263
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:28,440
Wait.

264
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,840
Their Luna just got... Sorry.

265
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,720
Their Luna just got two kills.

266
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:32,480
Oh, my God.

267
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,060
Never mind.

268
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:33,660
Congratulations.

269
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,300
You've done it.

270
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:35,860
You won.

271
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,340
You won a game on support.

272
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,880
I'm so proud of you, Necros.

273
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:39,580
All right.

274
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:39,920
Sorry.

275
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,140
Back to where I was talking about.

276
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,440
Um... Their Luna actually clutched it for them.

277
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,040
Wow.

278
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:47,740
Oh, my God.

279
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,920
Their Luna saved their entire team.

280
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,500
Um... The other support game.

281
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,180
All right.

282
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:54,480
Sorry.

283
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,300
Where was I?

284
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,320
Uh... Where was I, guys?

285
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,260
Um... Oh... Oh, wait.

286
00:16:59,460 --> 00:16:59,900
Never mind.

287
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,340
They're dead.

288
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:00,860
Never mind.

289
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:01,340
They lost.

290
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,060
Sorry, guys.

291
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:08,240
Uh... They... Their other... Their... Their other support ended up getting, like... Uh... They lost, by the way.

292
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,020
It was too late.

293
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:09,480
Oh, yeah.

294
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:09,860
So, yeah.

295
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,620
Captain America meta is so oppressive.

296
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,060
And I realized that recently.

297
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:13,960
Because I was practicing.

298
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,000
Um... The last couple of days.

299
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:17,600
Um...

300
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,380
Because when I found out that ShroudX was in the tournament.

301
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,460
Or, like... There were, like... Okay.

302
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,740
At first, I found out, like... There were a lot of, like... Overwatch players.

303
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:26,660
Overwatch pros.

304
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:27,680
That were in the tournament.

305
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,460
So, I was like... Okay.

306
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,660
This is getting a little more serious.

307
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:36,820
Because, like... Obviously, Overwatch players... Can easily transfer their skills... To... Marvel rivals.

308
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,520
So, I was like... Okay.

309
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,400
This is getting a little serious.

310
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,500
So, I should practice more.

311
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,520
And then I found out ShroudX's team is going to be in here.

312
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,560
So I was like, oh, fuck.

313
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,580
Okay, maybe I actually should know what's going on.

314
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,500
Maybe I should remember how to play the game.

315
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,220
It's pretty miserable as a support, though, in that meta.

316
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:01,040
Because I was playing Loki and Sue and Luna.

317
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:04,300
By the way, Rocket's apparently garbage now.

318
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:04,940
Thank God.

319
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,800
I definitely have never touched Rocket during that season.

320
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,260
Like, you have no proof on stream.

321
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,620
But yeah, I'm glad that Rocket is garbage again, which is great.

322
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:24,920
And yeah, so I guess that is all the Marvel Rivals stuff out of the way.

323
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:29,360
For those who are like, or like, oh, let me know when she's done talking about Marvel Rivals.

324
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,180
Don't worry.

325
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,180
That's out of the way.

326
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,180
Now it's time for the other life updates.

327
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,480
Now it's time for the other stuff I want to talk about.

328
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:39,120
Oh, yeah.

329
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,300
So while I was... Sorry.

330
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,420
JK, we're going back to Marvel Rivals.

331
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:42,860
I'm sorry.

332
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,100
You can tab out right now.

333
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,120
If that's not what you want to hear about.

334
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:46,800
Don't... Sorry.

335
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,560
Just one more thing.

336
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,600
So I wanted to try and get some of the skins.

337
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,380
Because I realized, like, oh, hey.

338
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,820
So there's, like, I really wanted to get the Manta skin.

339
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:58,060
And I noticed that you can do some of it in practice versus AI.

340
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,180
Because I just can't be bothered to, like, try.

341
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:06,300
So I tried practice versus AI on easy.

342
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:13,260
And, like... Because I assume that everyone that does this is just farming for the skins, right?

343
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:17,720
Like, they're not actually... They don't play it because they enjoy playing practice versus AI.

344
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:22,340
Like, they don't play... But... The thing is...

345
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:29,240
During one of my games, I had two players that were actually, like, calming.

346
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,260
And, like, was like, oh, my God.

347
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,220
Good job, guys.

348
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:32,900
We did it.

349
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:36,060
And I was like, there's no way this person is serious.

350
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,740
I was like, there's... There's no way.

351
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,320
Like, are you actually, like... Like...

352
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:44,560
Trying?

353
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,780
And then... Okay, this is really toxic.

354
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,120
But, like... It, like, blew my mind.

355
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,360
Because I was like, are you okay?

356
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:57,600
Like, we're... We're... By the way, we're... We're in easy.

357
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,720
I was in... I was in easy lobbies.

358
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,940
Like, the easiest bots.

359
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,100
Because I just needed to get this over with.

360
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,100
I have the PPE choice.

361
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:16,400
So, I... Okay, this is incredibly toxic.

362
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,240
I don't.

363
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,220
But I was curious.

364
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,560
I wanted to know what it was like on the other side.

365
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,520
Of... Of the... You know, on the other side.

366
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,880
And then, so...

367
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:28,140
I looked... I looked their profiles up.

368
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,140
Because, you know, they didn't...

369
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,120
I don't think they realized they can lock their profiles.

370
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,040
Like, at that point.

371
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,380
Because they're, like, casual players.

372
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,480
So, I don't think that has ever crossed their mind.

373
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,320
To be like, I should private my profile.

374
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,080
So, I looked at their profiles.

375
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,020
And their profile was...

376
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,520
Majority was practice versus AI.

377
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:43,980
So, I was like...

378
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,080
Okay, this is a practice versus AI enjoy.

379
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,960
And then I saw losses...

380
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,740
In practice versus AI.

381
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,340
And that's when I was like...

382
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:53,880
How?

383
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,600
I was like...

384
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,700
There is no...

385
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,940
That blew my mind.

386
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,190
Because I was single-handedly...

387
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:11,440
Spawn capping the AI bots.

388
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,220
Like, non-stop.

389
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,920
As a DPS.

390
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,160
And so, I was like...

391
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,420
How do you lose?

392
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,180
How do you...

393
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:26,140
How did six people single-handedly lose to bots?

394
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:31,260
Like, one person can just spawn camp an entire army of bots.

395
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,340
Like, entire army of bots.

396
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,680
You have to actively try to lose to bots.

397
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,580
So, that, like, blew my mind.

398
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,200
And then, like...

399
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,040
But then I looked at their rankings.

400
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:46,980
Because I was like...

401
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,480
Okay, let's see if this person plays rank.

402
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,160
And then I saw their rank.

403
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,500
And they played 300 games.

404
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,420
And they were hard-stuck.

405
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,080
Bronze 3.

406
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,480
And I was like...

407
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,160
I...

408
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,340
Like...

409
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:02,580
I...

410
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,000
I don't know what to say.

411
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:05,920
I don't...

412
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,020
I don't know what to say.

413
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,220
I...

414
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,440
I was like...

415
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,540
I guess that's how you lose in practice versus AI.

416
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,640
I...

417
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,000
I...

418
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,160
Yo, that's basically me.

419
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,300
Toke, come to France.

420
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,440
We're cool.

421
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,260
I just...

422
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,160
I don't know.

423
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,840
I've never, like...

424
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,480
Met someone like that.

425
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,640
Because it, like...

426
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,400
It just...

427
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,300
It just, like...

428
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,740
Blew my mind in general.

429
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,560
Because I was like, oh my god.

430
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,100
That's like the other side.

431
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,660
They're real.

432
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,480
They're real.

433
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:44,960
Oh my god.

434
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,620
They have a life outside of gaming.

435
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,020
Oh my god.

436
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,560
I want to know what that's like.

437
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,060
I'm sorry.

438
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:57,680
But like, for me, it's why I never play Valorant.

439
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,900
Because I know if I play Valorant, I'd be that person.

440
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:05,140
And it's why... because I... they're just so much stronger than me.

441
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:14,340
Because I was like, if I play 300 games and I'm heart-stuck bronze, I think at that point, I don't... this is not for me.

442
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:23,400
Like... I feel like... I feel like... this is... I got time to uninstall.

443
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,960
I need to choose a different passion in life.

444
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:30,680
They got... their mental... their mental game.

445
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:35,460
is so much stronger... than whatever I go through... daily.

446
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,440
Like... I would be done.

447
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:43,460
If I had... five losses... in a row, I'd crash out.

448
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,700
This person has three.

449
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:49,000
But like... I have five losses... in top 500 ELO games.

450
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,540
This guy... has so many losses... to beat.

451
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:53,900
That's the thing.

452
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:58,280
It's so hard to like... not rank up from bronze.

453
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,020
Because like... you're always gaining.

454
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,260
That's what blows my mind.

455
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,620
Because it's like... you don't lose a lot... in bronze.

456
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,260
But you gain so much.

457
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:13,260
So it's like... absolutely... I can't comprehend it.

458
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:22,480
Because it's like... how much do you have to lose... to like... debuff... the win points... you get.

459
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:28,780
Because when I... when I went from bronze... I get... plus 80 points.

460
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:34,080
So it's like... how much do you have to lose... to be stuck in bronze three?

461
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:40,400
I... I... I... and like... I was so... I... I don't understand.

462
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:40,720
10!

463
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,520
I... I... I... I... I...

464
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,720
Because you don't... you lose like... 10!

465
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,720
You lose 10!

466
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,940
In bronze!

467
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,540
Or like... I don't know.

468
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,560
I never lost in bronze.

469
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,840
So I'm just guessing.

470
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,400
And it's not like they started this season.

471
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,240
They've been playing for three seasons.

472
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,700
And they've been... I don't know.

473
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,780
I hope he's... He's so strong.

474
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:08,800
I hope he has a great... I bet his life is so happy and fulfilling.

475
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:18,540
And I honestly... If he is able to keep playing rivals after that, he must have an incredibly fulfilling life.

476
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:22,700
And I honestly... I wish I was him.

477
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,720
Like, I would crash out after five.

478
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:29,160
But he's like... He's enjoying life.

479
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,140
Like, he's like some pure, innocent soul that doesn't care.

480
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:37,200
He's out there grinding practice versus AI right now.

481
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,440
Enjoying his time.

482
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:44,880
Cheering his team on against little AI that you can spawn camp.

483
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:53,860
His happiness is not dependent on a video game score.

484
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:59,740
And like, I hope he's living the best life that he's living right now.

485
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:05,780
He has like... He gets actual joy from just being alive.

486
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,780
I... I...

487
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:13,010
I...

488
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:17,390
So... No, I... I... It was just... It was just crazy to like...

489
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:18,590
Um...

490
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,710
He's too strong.

491
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:26,190
He's like... He's like watching... He's like hanging out with his family right now.

492
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:28,230
He has a wife and two kids.

493
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:31,870
And like... After work, he plays a couple of games...

494
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:33,130
On my arrivals.

495
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:35,350
Before he goes to bed with his loving wife.

496
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:37,590
And just like, you know...

497
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:42,110
He's... He has a good 401k.

498
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:45,170
He has a good job that pays for the tuitions.

499
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:46,210
For like...

500
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:46,810
His children.

501
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,770
To college and everything.

502
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:50,210
Like... He's...

503
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:55,070
He's getting some tonight.

504
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:56,210
Uh...

505
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:59,050
That sounds like the dream.

506
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:00,750
I hate him.

507
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:01,530
That...

508
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:06,350
Like... That's the only way I can justify...

509
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:12,530
A person that can like... Like go on with their life and still come back to Marvel Rivals.

510
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:18,050
And still like... Come back to Marvel Rivals.

511
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:19,350
For their like...

512
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:21,750
301 game in rank.

513
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:23,210
And still be in Bronze 3.

514
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:25,890
That's the only way I can justify it in my mind.

515
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:27,810
That... Where he's still doing it.

516
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:30,070
Like...

517
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:35,170
Anyway...

518
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:35,890
Sorry...

519
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:38,830
The Marvel Rivals stuff... Uh... Tangent is gone now.

520
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:39,610
Alright, I'm ready.

521
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:42,110
I'm ready.

522
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,990
I'm ready to talk about something else.

523
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:45,150
Alright, so...

524
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:46,890
Um... Other than that...

525
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:47,890
I wanna talk about...

526
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:48,770
The...

527
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:49,950
The 3D...

528
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:50,890
Debut...

529
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:52,610
Bait and Switch video I uploaded.

530
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:54,910
Where I actually lost subscribers.

531
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:56,350
Because people were like...

532
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:58,690
I can't believe you did this.

533
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:00,310
But it's like...

534
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,790
That video...

535
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:02,590
Was...

536
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:03,110
Like...

537
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:03,970
Released...

538
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:05,590
A couple of months ago.

539
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:06,830
And...

540
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:07,090
Um...

541
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:08,390
And like...

542
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:10,670
So some people were like...

543
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:11,190
Mad...

544
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,110
That I...

545
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:12,610
Uploaded...

546
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:13,270
Okay, so...

547
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,770
The reason why...

548
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:15,490
Um...

549
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:16,530
I...

550
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:17,730
Uploaded...

551
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:19,350
Was because...

552
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,210
Um...

553
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:20,910
Was because...

554
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:23,430
I actually got the video...

555
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:24,770
I had the video...

556
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:25,370
Polished...

557
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,250
And re-edited...

558
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:26,910
And added like...

559
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:27,110
You know...

560
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:27,870
More stuff to it.

561
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:28,710
Like music...

562
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:29,330
Sound effects...

563
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:29,670
And everything.

564
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:30,690
So...

565
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:31,830
That was the reason...

566
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:32,890
Why...

567
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:34,050
I uploaded...

568
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:34,710
On a...

569
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:36,090
Random Wednesday...

570
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:36,870
At like...

571
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:37,750
Right before...

572
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:38,190
Like you know...

573
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:39,150
Random Wednesday...

574
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,030
At 5pm...

575
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,050
Or something...

576
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:41,350
Um...

577
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:41,910
That was...

578
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:43,550
Because I was like...

579
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:43,990
Oh...

580
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,430
I finally got the video...

581
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:47,150
I guess I should upload it...

582
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:47,470
And just...

583
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:47,830
I don't know...

584
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:48,550
Get ad...

585
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:50,270
You off of it...

586
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:50,550
You know?

587
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:51,810
Like...

588
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:52,410
Um...

589
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:53,050
And then...

590
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:53,850
So people can like...

591
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:54,790
Watch the video...

592
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:55,450
On it's own...

593
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:56,690
Instead of watching the...

594
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:56,970
You know...

595
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:59,190
Rewinding it on the stream...

596
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:00,750
So I figured...

597
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,830
I might as well...

598
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:02,490
Upload it...

599
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,210
Because you know...

600
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:04,190
I have the video...

601
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:05,270
Videos done...

602
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:05,730
Like...

603
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:06,830
I'm not gonna wait...

604
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:07,890
Any longer...

605
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:09,670
I wasn't gonna wait...

606
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:10,210
Any longer...

607
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:11,550
To upload it...

608
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:13,910
Um...

609
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:14,890
And it was so...

610
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:16,290
And then I had to like...

611
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:18,450
Write an emergency comment...

612
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:19,410
Because people thought...

613
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:21,470
I doxxed myself...

614
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:21,930
And like...

615
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:23,510
Did a face reveal...

616
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:24,610
Even though like...

617
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:25,570
You can tell...

618
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:26,810
After several...

619
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:27,130
Like...

620
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:28,590
I wrote in the description...

621
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:29,470
Like credited...

622
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:30,870
The cosplayers...

623
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:31,690
And everything...

624
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:32,910
And also like...

625
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:33,330
You know...

626
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:34,450
There's different cosplayers...

627
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,070
So people thought...

628
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:36,790
And now I was like...

629
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:37,250
Guys...

630
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:38,510
I have to write in the comments...

631
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,170
And pin it...

632
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:39,870
And be like...

633
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:40,890
Guys...

634
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:41,410
Like...

635
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:43,510
It was a video I put on...

636
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:45,450
During the anniversary...!

637
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:48,130
So...

638
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:51,590
So, I thought I was... I was not... Okay.

639
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:58,390
The one thing I wasn't ready for was that I actually lost subscribers and pissed people off.

640
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:07,130
I remember one of the person that commented on the video was like, I can't believe you did this.

641
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:09,190
You know this is not funny, right?

642
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:10,770
Like, I...

643
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:16,010
They're like, you know this is not funny.

644
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:22,310
Like, this is gonna make your 3D debut less exciting when you do your real one.

645
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:24,150
And I was like, what?

646
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:25,750
Oh my god.

647
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:26,550
I forgot.

648
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,110
I'm sorry.

649
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:34,790
Like... Trip, thank you for the super chat.

650
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:35,430
Thank you.

651
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:36,230
Thank you.

652
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:42,250
I was like, whoa!

653
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:43,470
Whoa!

654
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,350
I'm sorry.

655
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:48,330
I just wanted to upload this video.

656
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,490
I thought it was pretty funny.

657
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:53,450
I mean, it is gonna happen eventually.

658
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:57,150
I just... I just thought it was really funny.

659
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:05,590
But yeah, anyway.

660
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:08,490
So, I just wanted to talk about that real quick.

661
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:10,290
Another thing is that...

662
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:15,950
Today, I recently... Okay, so... Okay, so this is a really bad habit of mine.

663
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:18,670
But I don't check my mailbox often.

664
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:25,750
So, like, I let it build up for, like, several... Like, maybe, like, a week or two before I checked my mailbox.

665
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:28,770
Because I'm like, who's gonna send me mail?

666
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:29,890
But then I forgot.

667
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:31,590
So today, I checked my mailbox.

668
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:32,650
And I forgot.

669
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:35,590
Oh, the government sends me mail.

670
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:36,750
So...

671
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,790
Um, I got really worried.

672
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:40,690
Because I checked my mailbox.

673
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,790
And then I had, like...

674
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:47,290
Like, around five to six letters.

675
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:49,970
From the Canadian government.

676
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:51,530
And...

677
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:54,310
And then I was like...

678
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,430
Oh, my God.

679
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:57,670
Did I commit tax fraud?

680
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:03,610
Because one of them said the Canadian Revenue Agency.

681
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:04,590
So...

682
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:07,130
So, I was like...

683
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:07,990
Oh, my God.

684
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:09,750
Oh, my... Am I getting arrested?

685
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:10,790
I...

686
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:12,090
I...

687
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:12,390
Because...

688
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:13,010
I...

689
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:14,010
I saw...

690
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:16,210
There were so many Canadian...

691
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:17,190
And it said...

692
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:17,970
I can see...

693
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:19,970
Okay, I have them right here next to me.

694
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:20,810
And I got...

695
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:21,670
I got so scared.

696
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:22,510
I had to...

697
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,210
You know...

698
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:23,450
I...

699
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:24,770
When I went up the elevator.

700
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,330
And it was like...

701
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:28,430
Important notice inside.

702
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:29,910
And I was like...

703
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:30,830
Oh, my God.

704
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:33,370
Oh, I did not check my mail in a while.

705
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:34,470
I...

706
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,110
And then...

707
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,210
Because I was like...

708
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:40,770
Why is there so many letters...

709
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:42,710
From the Canadian government?

710
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:44,050
And so...

711
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:44,790
When I got up...

712
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:46,970
Obviously, I instantly opened my mail...

713
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:47,570
To be like...

714
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:49,030
What the fuck is in it?

715
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:50,870
And it was a check for money.

716
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:52,230
Because I did...

717
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:53,230
Thank God...

718
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,950
I did my taxes correctly.

719
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:55,930
So...

720
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:56,790
But the thing is...

721
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:57,950
So...

722
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:00,390
I submitted various things...

723
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:01,430
And it was just...

724
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:02,190
It was like...

725
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:03,810
Oh, we're sending you...

726
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:05,470
This is your tax refund...

727
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:07,390
That you did for your taxes.

728
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:08,710
This is your tax refund.

729
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:09,690
So...

730
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:11,930
Later, you're gonna receive...

731
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:12,750
Another...

732
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:13,630
Another...

733
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:14,410
Letter...

734
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:15,570
That will have your...

735
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:16,530
The check for it.

736
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:18,390
So that's why I had like...

737
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:19,150
10...

738
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:20,030
Letters...

739
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:20,990
In my mailbox...

740
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:22,370
Mailbox...

741
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:23,750
Because like...

742
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,630
It was for various other stuff...

743
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:26,710
Regarding like...

744
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:27,010
My...

745
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:28,550
My tax refunds...

746
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:28,990
So...

747
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:30,610
Yeah, I got money...

748
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:31,310
So I got...

749
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,070
So I was like...

750
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:32,950
Oh, thank God...

751
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:34,670
I'm not getting arrested...

752
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:35,230
I was like...

753
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:36,370
Holy shit...

754
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:36,970
Because I was like...

755
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:38,910
Why did they send me...

756
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:39,450
10 letters...

757
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:40,430
Like...

758
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:43,970
I was like...

759
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:45,650
It wasn't like I haven't...

760
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:46,550
Um...

761
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:47,770
It wasn't like I haven't...

762
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:48,870
Checked my mail...

763
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:50,310
For a very, very long...

764
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,190
I just got...

765
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:52,650
10 different letters...

766
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:54,450
About taxes...

767
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:54,930
I...

768
00:33:58,710 --> 00:33:59,270
So...

769
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,410
I was like...

770
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:00,890
Yippee!

771
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:02,450
Tax refunds!

772
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:03,130
So I got like...

773
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:04,630
A couple of checks for...

774
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:05,650
Tax refunds...

775
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:06,170
And they were just...

776
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:06,830
Telling me like...

777
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:07,950
You're gonna get it later...

778
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:08,570
I'm like...

779
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:08,850
Yay!

780
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:10,490
I didn't fuck up!

781
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:11,690
I didn't...

782
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:15,890
I was like...

783
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:16,070
Whoa!

784
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:18,230
I don't see...

785
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,170
I got a little scared...

786
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:19,690
I was like...

787
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:20,350
Oh my God!

788
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:21,330
Like...

789
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:23,530
Am I gonna get arrested?

790
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:24,490
Like...

791
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:25,270
Are they gonna...

792
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:26,750
They know where I live?

793
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:28,430
Um...

794
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:30,410
Did Joki commit tax fraud?

795
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:33,470
Um...

796
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:34,150
Uh...

797
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:34,690
Vox...

798
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:35,610
Thank you for the super chat...

799
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:35,910
Thank you...

800
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:36,390
Thank you...

801
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:37,610
I hope you're never too sorry...

802
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:39,170
For making overly serious people...

803
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:39,610
Rage...

804
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,370
Because it happens to make me personally laugh...

805
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,330
More than enough to make up for it...

806
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:44,250
Thank you for the super chat...

807
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:44,630
Thank you...

808
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:45,410
Thank you...

809
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:46,450
Yeah, I'm just glad...

810
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:48,810
I had a lot of people that did think it was really funny...

811
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:49,510
But also...

812
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:52,190
I was very surprised with the people that were very...

813
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:54,270
Very mad about it...

814
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:55,270
Um...

815
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:55,550
Anton...

816
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,510
Thank you for the super chat...

817
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:56,810
Thank you...

818
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:57,510
Thank you...

819
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:00,170
Your magic could reach through the screen and snatch your soul...

820
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:01,310
Why are you like this?

821
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:02,070
Thank you for the...

822
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:02,590
Uh...

823
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:03,050
Super chat...

824
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:04,550
Thank you...

825
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:05,010
Thank you...

826
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:05,530
Thank you...

827
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:06,510
Anyway...

828
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:07,550
Sorry...

829
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:08,990
That was a long...

830
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:09,350
Yap...

831
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:09,670
Uh...

832
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:10,010
Tangent...

833
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:11,710
Yapping section...

834
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:15,290
Before we actually played Dynasty Warriors...

835
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:15,830
Uh...

836
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:17,630
Today we're going to attempt...

837
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:19,310
To finish...

838
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:21,010
The Shu Kingdom...

839
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:23,250
For Dynasty Warriors Origin...

840
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:24,290
And after that...

841
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:26,210
The Wei and Wu storylines...

842
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:27,550
Will be moved over...

843
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,250
To Twitch...

844
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:29,430
So my channel...

845
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:30,790
Will stop dying...

846
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:31,210
And...

847
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:32,730
Ha ha ha ha ha...

848
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:34,130
My manager...

849
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:36,770
Was very happy about this...

850
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:38,030
They were like...

851
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,250
They were like...

852
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:39,590
Uh...

853
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:40,390
Today...

854
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:41,430
They were like...

855
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,650
Thank God...

856
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:43,770
You're finally...

857
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:45,450
Moving the stream...

858
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:46,890
The series...

859
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:47,670
To Twitch...

860
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:49,250
Because it's affecting...

861
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:50,650
Your algorithm...

862
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:51,410
And...

863
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:52,550
They're like...

864
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,530
I'm like...

865
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:54,490
Yeah...

866
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:55,910
I'm gonna try...

867
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:57,250
I'm gonna try...

868
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:57,750
My best...

869
00:35:58,350 --> 00:35:59,770
Ha ha ha ha...

870
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:02,290
Yay...

871
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:03,650
Dooky's channel's gonna...

872
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:04,870
Die a little less...

873
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:06,270
After today...

874
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:07,270
But little does he know...

875
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:08,770
I'm gonna play Epic Mickey...

876
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:09,470
After...

877
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:10,750
And I don't think...

878
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:13,050
That's gonna save my channel...

879
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:14,150
Ha ha ha ha...

880
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,430
Ha ha ha...

881
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:16,630
Um...

882
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:17,330
Um...

883
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:17,750
And...

884
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,150
Please be more...

885
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,510
...considerate of that.

886
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:24,810
Anyway, so...

887
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:26,530
But what else was I gonna say?

888
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:28,790
I will attempt...

889
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:35,130
...to finish Dynasty Warriors Origins for Shu's storyline today.

890
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:38,510
Please stop self-sabotaging yourself.

891
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:43,850
Doki, please play Halo!

892
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:45,910
It will save your channel!

893
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:48,290
Doki, play Metal Gear!

894
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:49,130
Anything!

895
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:51,710
Stop doing this to yourself!

896
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:53,950
That's the thing, guys!

897
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:57,550
I could never get Disney perms in the past!

898
00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:00,810
Now I can play all the Disney games I want!

899
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:08,170
Anyway...

900
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:12,610
What else was I gonna talk about?

901
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:16,370
Oh yeah, sorry, I said I should stop talking about stuff because we gotta play...

902
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:20,310
Sorry, this is a long, like, yapping section before the games start.

903
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:21,600
Um...

904
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:22,810
Anyway, so...

905
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:24,530
Yeah, I'm looking forward to...

906
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:27,090
To try and finish Dynasty Warriors today.

907
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:28,730
It's gonna be a long day.

908
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:30,170
Um...

909
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:34,810
But, like, at least at this point, we should be meeting my Oshi forever.

910
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:38,990
So, like, he's not just gonna show up for, like, five seconds and then fuck off.

911
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:42,510
And I have to talk to his goddamn wife who's making a...

912
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,170
Um...

913
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:47,190
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

914
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:47,350
Yeah.

915
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:48,990
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

916
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:50,410
And then...

917
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:51,030
And then...

918
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:53,770
Telling me how realistic it is and everything!

919
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,190
So, like...

920
00:37:55,190 --> 00:38:02,150
At least I can finally talk to my husband and my Oshi and, like, things will be less awkward, I think.

921
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:02,830
Uh...

922
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:03,370
But, yeah!

923
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:04,290
Alright, let's...

924
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:05,490
Let's get play the game!

925
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:08,990
B-b-b-b Dynasty Warriors Origin!

926
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:09,830
Oh yeah, I forgot.

927
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:11,250
It's left Doki time.

928
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:13,590
Left Doki, where are you?

929
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:16,870
No, I keep using... I keep pulling up center Doki.

930
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:19,330
Whoa, and that's a little to the side Doki.

931
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:21,350
And that is not left.

932
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:23,230
Okay, that's center Doki again.

933
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:25,910
And then that's... I just pull up the same Doki.

934
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:26,490
Okay, there you go.

935
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:27,490
There's left Doki.

936
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:29,750
I keep pulling up the wrong Doki's.

937
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,050
All right.

938
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:33,570
There you go.

939
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:36,010
Abelion, thank you for the super chat.

940
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:36,390
Thank you.

941
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:37,030
Thank you.

942
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:39,210
Hey Doki, today's my 38th birthday.

943
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:43,190
Happy to be able to spend the evening with my Oshi streaming my favorite game series.

944
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:45,370
Even if it killed your channel.

945
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:46,410
Yippee!

946
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:48,610
Don't worry.

947
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:51,430
We only filtered the weak.

948
00:38:51,690 --> 00:39:01,370
If they can't love me from my Dynasty Warriors Fujoshi moments, then they can't love me during my other algorithm boosting moments.

949
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:08,350
Happy birthday to you.

950
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:10,690
Happy birthday to you.

951
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:11,710
Happy birthday to you.

952
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:13,410
Happy birthday, dear Abelion.

953
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:16,070
Happy birthday to you.

954
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:16,650
Woo!

955
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,000
All right.

956
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:20,520
Let's see.

957
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,080
Where did I go?

958
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:21,880
Gah!

959
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:22,800
Oh, yeah.

960
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:23,160
I forgot.

961
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,360
There was no sound.

962
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,200
I forgot.

963
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,100
I turned that out.

964
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,220
All right.

965
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:27,660
There we go.

966
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,220
Gah!

967
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:30,780
Okay.

968
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,660
Am I supposed to talk to anybody?

969
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,500
No.

970
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:34,200
All right.

971
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:34,400
Wait.

972
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:43,240
Actually, I know that I have, like, there were, like, people I was supposed to talk to, but I didn't bother because they were not, like, the people I want to talk to.

973
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,600
Uh, Smokey, thank you for the super chat.

974
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:45,980
Thank you.

975
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:46,580
Thank you.

976
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,040
Oh, yeah.

977
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:47,720
I forgot to mention.

978
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,600
The reason why the Dynasty Warriors time slot changed to 5 p.m.

979
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:57,200
is that, um, um, I did ask, like, uh, I did ask everybody which one they prefer.

980
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:04,800
And majority of the Dragon's voted for 5 p.m., and that's why the time slot changed, uh, to be at this time to finish the series.

981
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:05,180
Yeah.

982
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:06,140
There was a vote.

983
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,340
We voted.

984
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,260
Just, like, how the Pope was voted in.

985
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:14,020
I like how, like, an American Pope, like, literally came out of nowhere with a steel chair.

986
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:19,140
Like, I, I was like, I didn't see these, I didn't see this candidate in my Pope watch.

987
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,860
In my, what was it called?

988
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,220
Pope Crave.

989
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,280
Like, that wasn't in my Pope Crave Twitter following.

990
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,260
Where did he come from?

991
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:34,200
Um, same, like, RKO out of nowhere.

992
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:40,700
That's the American spirit, bro.

993
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,960
Oh, yeah, I was following Pope Crave.

994
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,840
It's, like, Pop Crave, but, like, for Popes.

995
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:49,240
Um, I don't know how to explain it.

996
00:40:50,500 --> 00:41:02,440
There was a Twitter account that just was basically following the, the live, it was, like, live tweet updates on, like, if they selected the Pope yet.

997
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:06,740
And, and it was pretty, they were, like, if, what was it called?

998
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:09,360
Like, a fan account of, like, Conclave or what?

999
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:14,420
Like, an incredibly obsessive account about the movie Conclave.

1000
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:18,320
And then, like, yeah, then they decided, yeah, it was, like, Pope Watch.

1001
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:24,560
I put all my money in Spanish, Pope.

1002
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,600
Oh, it's you.

1003
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:28,920
Give this a try, will ya?

1004
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:29,760
Okay, what's this?

1005
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,200
Launch a successful ambush charge.

1006
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:36,820
Defeat using gauntlets and hit 200 soldiers with mounted charge.

1007
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:37,260
Alright.

1008
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,020
Sure, I can do that.

1009
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,340
I can, actually.

1010
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,580
Do I really wanna woo him, though?

1011
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,200
He's just a Guan Yun fanboy.

1012
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,580
And I want him for my son.

1013
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:53,320
And there could only be one Guan Yun fanboy.

1014
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:54,440
Alright.

1015
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:55,700
Let's kill him.

1016
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,800
The Pope bets.

1017
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,240
Oh, yeah.

1018
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:02,700
Like, the live bets going on who's gonna be the new Pope.

1019
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:05,700
People were so sad that...

1020
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,500
That, like...

1021
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:10,700
The Pope that won literally came out of nowhere.

1022
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,260
He was not on my betting sites!

1023
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:19,560
Alright, what do I have to do?

1024
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:24,960
Alright.

1025
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,580
I need to...

1026
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,120
Let's see.

1027
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,580
I need to use the gauntlets.

1028
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,220
Someone out there got the 50k.

1029
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:38,600
Everyone lost so much money on the Pope gambling.

1030
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:43,840
I need to use my gauntlets.

1031
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,300
And then...

1032
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:45,740
Success mount.

1033
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:48,180
So, two mounted charges.

1034
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:49,140
Wait.

1035
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:49,900
Where my...

1036
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,120
Like, my mounted charges?

1037
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:53,260
Pompot.

1038
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,280
Thank you for the super chat.

1039
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:54,700
Thank you.

1040
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:55,420
Thank you.

1041
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:57,040
Doki setting up.

1042
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,020
Yeah, he shows for air again.

1043
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:00,160
Thank you for the super chat.

1044
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:00,540
Thank you.

1045
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:01,080
Thank you.

1046
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:01,860
Alright.

1047
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:02,360
Let's see.

1048
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,700
I need to use gauntlets.

1049
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:03,980
Okay.

1050
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:04,740
My hands.

1051
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:05,600
Wait.

1052
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:06,100
Is there...

1053
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,740
Is it just regular?

1054
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:09,900
Regular hands?

1055
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:11,080
Okay.

1056
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:12,360
I need to use battle arts.

1057
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:12,760
Okay.

1058
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:14,660
Let's go.

1059
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:16,180
Alright.

1060
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:16,740
Where are they?

1061
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:20,560
Don't worry.

1062
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:23,380
I'm gonna go straight in.

1063
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:24,520
Because I have...

1064
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,760
I'm not very smart.

1065
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:28,620
I'm just like the shoe forces.

1066
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:32,200
I'm like the shoe forces, guys.

1067
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,060
We don't know what we're actually doing.

1068
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:35,200
Alright.

1069
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:36,880
Nice.

1070
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:38,920
Oh, shit.

1071
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:41,560
Oh, my God.

1072
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:42,040
Please.

1073
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:44,180
I don't know what I'm doing.

1074
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:44,900
It's been a while.

1075
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:46,180
Oh, nice.

1076
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:47,820
I totally know what I'm doing.

1077
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,200
Oh, shit.

1078
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:50,560
Nice.

1079
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:52,340
That's right.

1080
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:54,600
Get over here.

1081
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,860
I'm gonna keep fisting you.

1082
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,560
Yeah, falcon.

1083
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:04,460
Alright, to be fair, I'm like the peak shoe general.

1084
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:07,700
We go in with zero plans every time.

1085
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,980
All we do is we just fight.

1086
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:14,140
Like, you have to admit, that's literally all we do.

1087
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,900
We have no strats.

1088
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:19,640
Let's get serious.

1089
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:20,060
Okay.

1090
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,560
I need that and then...

1091
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,940
Oh, no.

1092
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:26,740
Oh, no.

1093
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:27,720
Oh, no.

1094
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,260
It's been too long since I played.

1095
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,160
Where am I?

1096
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:33,260
Oh, I'm down here.

1097
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:33,940
Oh, my God.

1098
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:35,060
I didn't even realize where I was.

1099
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:38,600
I couldn't tell where I was in this game.

1100
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,400
Oh, it's been too long.

1101
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:44,200
Alright, nice.

1102
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:45,880
Oh, no.

1103
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:46,360
Not nice.

1104
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:47,840
Oh, no.

1105
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:50,220
Wait, ten of you guys are already dead?

1106
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:50,860
How?

1107
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,200
God, I hate this.

1108
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:55,840
Oh, my God.

1109
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:56,400
It's fine.

1110
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:57,300
If they die, they die.

1111
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:00,340
I can 1v3 all of them.

1112
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,160
Alright, has been critically...

1113
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:04,500
How?

1114
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,300
All I've been doing is fighting.

1115
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:08,160
How are you already dead?

1116
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:11,120
I've only been fighting.

1117
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:14,660
Okay.

1118
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:16,600
Wait, did I do it?

1119
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,340
800 flows.

1120
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:20,880
Did I do it, guys?

1121
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:23,660
I...

1122
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:24,440
84?

1123
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,900
Okay, I clearly need to fix this.

1124
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,940
But I clearly...

1125
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:31,860
Clearly, this is not it.

1126
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:33,900
Maw of the Tiger.

1127
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:36,420
Okay, I sh...

1128
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:38,020
Is there anything that's better?

1129
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,240
That's a 1?

1130
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,340
Okay, power shot.

1131
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:43,280
Okay, that's my bow.

1132
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:44,840
That's clearly not better.

1133
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:46,080
Oh, the ice.

1134
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,460
Okay, we'll use ice.

1135
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:49,580
And then...

1136
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,060
Okay, that should be fine.

1137
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:55,080
Okay, that should be fine.

1138
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:55,380
That's fine.

1139
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,180
He'll be fine.

1140
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:57,460
Guys, he'll be fine.

1141
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:58,280
He doesn't need me.

1142
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,660
Okay, I'll head over and so he'll eat his buns.

1143
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:04,040
He did not need me.

1144
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,460
He was strong enough for this.

1145
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:06,820
Oh, Jesus.

1146
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:09,500
Everybody is so bad.

1147
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:12,920
Wait, who?

1148
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:14,740
Are you giving up already?

1149
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:17,620
How are you giving up?

1150
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:20,840
Oh my God, there's only five of you left, Dragos?

1151
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:22,100
How did you all die?

1152
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:25,080
Jesus.

1153
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:25,500
Okay.

1154
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:29,140
Okay, maybe this is not the right...

1155
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:33,800
Okay, maybe this was not the right thing.

1156
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,800
Maybe I should not be doing this mission.

1157
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:37,440
My team is not okay.

1158
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,040
Everybody is...

1159
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,120
Everybody is sort of dying.

1160
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:46,780
Alright, nice.

1161
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:47,460
He's one hit.

1162
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:49,680
Okay, nice.

1163
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:52,940
I don't understand.

1164
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,080
For me, my fist is a bad weapon?

1165
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:57,700
No way.

1166
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:01,460
Take this.

1167
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:02,120
Okay.

1168
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:03,780
Get over here.

1169
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,540
Gwanyun, how could you die?

1170
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:08,000
You're literally the God of War!

1171
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:09,820
How?

1172
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,520
I've killed, like, almost all of them!

1173
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:18,480
I feel like that's all I've been doing!

1174
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:22,500
Oh my God, everybody is actually dying.

1175
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:25,780
Oh my God, Gwanyun, please, not you too.

1176
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:27,160
Gwanyun, please.

1177
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:28,700
Each area we take.

1178
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:29,340
Gwanyun, please.

1179
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:30,020
All my might!

1180
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,060
You're, I've been vested in the enemy officer.

1181
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:33,060
That's how...

1182
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:36,160
You're right, he has to die to become the God of War.

1183
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:38,300
Okay, you're not wrong!

1184
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:41,260
Gwanyun, please.

1185
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:42,040
All my might!

1186
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:45,860
I'm simply, like, speed...

1187
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:48,140
I'm simply speedrunning his destiny.

1188
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:50,960
Oh my God, he's actually one hit!

1189
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:53,840
You shine like a beacon for the others.

1190
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:54,600
Oh no.

1191
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:54,620
Oh no.

1192
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:56,500
Okay.

1193
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:58,400
That should be fine.

1194
00:47:58,660 --> 00:47:59,440
I've killed them all.

1195
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:01,300
If I could test my skills.

1196
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:01,840
Let's go.

1197
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:02,740
If I just have to go downstairs.

1198
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:05,840
You're right, guys.

1199
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:09,820
I'm simply just letting him become the God of War.

1200
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:11,000
That's right.

1201
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:11,020
That's right.

1202
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:11,700
That's right.

1203
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:12,300
That's right.

1204
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:12,540
So true.

1205
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,660
Making sure he follows his destiny.

1206
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:18,740
Sometimes you just have to run.

1207
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:22,440
Wait, are they inside?

1208
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:26,820
Wait, are they inside already?

1209
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:29,600
Oh shit, I didn't know.

1210
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:30,660
Oh my God.

1211
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:32,560
I didn't know you guys are inside.

1212
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:33,500
I was just...

1213
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:34,400
I was doing my own thing.

1214
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:35,920
Oh, is chat dead?

1215
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:36,480
Okay, don't worry.

1216
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:37,080
I'll save chat.

1217
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:38,600
Oh my God.

1218
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:39,240
Gwanyun, please.

1219
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:40,760
Gwanyun, please.

1220
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:44,580
Okay, nice.

1221
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:47,900
No, fuck it.

1222
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:48,680
I'm gonna use rage.

1223
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:52,920
Alright.

1224
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,020
Yeah, I can keep using this.

1225
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:00,540
Now keep punching him.

1226
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:02,580
That's right.

1227
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:03,360
Get out of here.

1228
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:04,360
Wait, get back closer.

1229
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:06,320
Get back closer so I can use my musu.

1230
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:08,520
Okay, nice.

1231
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:12,880
No, there's still four of you guys.

1232
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:14,400
Four of you guys are still alive.

1233
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:15,680
There's still hope.

1234
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:18,500
Alright.

1235
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:19,700
Get out.

1236
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:21,440
Get out.

1237
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,460
Okay, my team should be okay now, right?

1238
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:29,600
Oh my God.

1239
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:30,760
There's still one more.

1240
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:31,720
Oh my God.

1241
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:33,560
Where did these people come from?

1242
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,460
Where did they come from?

1243
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:44,440
Okay, nice.

1244
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:45,840
Okay.

1245
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:49,280
Just need to do one more.

1246
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:50,460
Nice.

1247
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:54,100
Now I have free reign to keep fisting.

1248
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,400
Pause my arms.

1249
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:57,220
Don't worry.

1250
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:57,940
We can give you.

1251
00:49:58,060 --> 00:49:59,040
We can rebuild you.

1252
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,240
You're rebuildable.

1253
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,340
We'll just give you like metal arms.

1254
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:08,180
It's cool there.

1255
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:12,680
The enemy officer has been defeated.

1256
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:13,680
Oh, I killed him.

1257
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:15,120
Oh, nice.

1258
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:15,740
I did it.

1259
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,060
I did my job.

1260
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:21,600
Wait, get back here.

1261
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,040
Wait, get back here.

1262
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:24,420
Wait, get back here.

1263
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:26,940
That's right, Zalio.

1264
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:27,560
Do your thing.

1265
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:30,480
That's fucking right.

1266
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:32,580
Keep fisting.

1267
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:36,040
And now I'll fucking throw you.

1268
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:36,560
RKO.

1269
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,560
Just like how the American Pope became a Pope.

1270
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:40,760
This is going my way today.

1271
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,160
Maybe next time.

1272
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:44,860
All right.

1273
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:46,140
So how do I get up here?

1274
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:50,460
All right.

1275
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:51,780
I go up.

1276
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,200
That's very slow.

1277
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,480
Wait, I can do the air.

1278
00:50:56,540 --> 00:50:56,940
Oh, my God.

1279
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:00,280
There better be enough of you guys so I can do my stupid charge thing.

1280
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:01,120
There is...

1281
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:09,120
There better be enough of you guys alive so I can finally do my goddamn ambush.

1282
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:11,760
I've been trying to do it this entire time.

1283
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:13,360
Oh, my God.

1284
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:14,760
I swear to God.

1285
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:17,420
There better be enough of you alive.

1286
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:19,320
I swear to God.

1287
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:27,440
I waited my whole life to get one successful tactic.

1288
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:29,960
And it's gonna be him.

1289
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:31,680
Oh, my God.

1290
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:32,580
Wait, I should get...

1291
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:35,120
Wait, can I even let...

1292
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:35,840
Oh, my God.

1293
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:36,480
Wait.

1294
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:38,600
Wait.

1295
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:39,840
Oh.

1296
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:41,260
Destroy this.

1297
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:42,420
Okay.

1298
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,580
Okay, guys.

1299
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,100
Oh, my God.

1300
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:47,760
Okay.

1301
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:49,720
No!

1302
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:52,060
Why are you all dead?

1303
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,040
No!

1304
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,100
There was not...

1305
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:03,300
Guys, there was...

1306
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:06,200
There was actually not enough, guys.

1307
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:09,800
There was actually not enough.

1308
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:11,200
Who would have thought?

1309
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:13,280
There was...

1310
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,560
You are all dead.

1311
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:21,640
You don't have enough allies.

1312
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:24,880
How could all of you be dead?

1313
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:30,600
I don't understand.

1314
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:37,360
I don't understand.

1315
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:38,920
It doesn't make sense.

1316
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:44,040
None of it makes sense.

1317
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:46,800
Make it make sense.

1318
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:48,780
We can respawn.

1319
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,180
We can respawn.

1320
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:50,760
That's so far.

1321
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:58,880
That's a little too far, guys.

1322
00:52:59,340 --> 00:52:59,960
That's...

1323
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:00,860
I don't know.

1324
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:02,600
I don't know.

1325
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:03,600
How far is that?

1326
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:05,680
Where's the next friendly base?

1327
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:07,020
Let me...

1328
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:10,060
Let me check how far it is before I...

1329
00:53:10,510 --> 00:53:11,460
Let me see it.

1330
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:17,060
I mean, it's like...

1331
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:18,720
All the way down there.

1332
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:20,040
I...

1333
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:21,100
I mean...

1334
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,380
I mean...

1335
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:28,340
It's on you for dying, though.

1336
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:29,580
Like...

1337
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:31,900
Is it really my fun?

1338
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:35,480
That's all I'm saying.

1339
00:53:37,570 --> 00:53:40,000
You did die yourself.

1340
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:41,580
So...

1341
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:43,880
I mean...

1342
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:46,940
Why am I rewarding that behavior?

1343
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,820
I did my job, though.

1344
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:55,600
That means I must fall back for now.

1345
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:56,340
I mean...

1346
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:58,000
I was doing my job.

1347
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:02,520
What were you doing?

1348
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:03,460
I...

1349
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:04,120
Did you...

1350
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:06,040
I literally killed Chow Chow's cousin.

1351
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:07,040
What do you mean?

1352
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:08,140
I killed him.

1353
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:09,500
What did you do?

1354
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:10,980
You were dead when it happened.

1355
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:11,800
Follow me.

1356
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:12,840
Liubei.

1357
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,560
Forward march.

1358
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:16,880
I knew you guys were dead when it happened.

1359
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:28,380
I didn't have enough of the...

1360
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:28,840
Meter.

1361
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,000
Okay.

1362
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,040
Nice.

1363
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:34,680
Oh, my God.

1364
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:36,000
That's fine.

1365
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:36,900
I can do this.

1366
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:37,960
Nice.

1367
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:40,880
That's not what it was written.

1368
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:41,960
Well, like...

1369
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:43,260
What if I was shy?

1370
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:43,840
Huh?

1371
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:44,880
I'm...

1372
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,140
I'm just a little shy.

1373
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:47,580
I didn't want to be...

1374
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:49,060
I didn't want to be in the history.

1375
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:49,740
books, guys.

1376
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:50,400
I...

1377
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,500
I was just incredibly shy.

1378
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:53,020
Okay?

1379
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:54,180
It's okay.

1380
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:56,340
Dying doesn't impact the story.

1381
00:54:58,620 --> 00:54:59,140
Okay.

1382
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,600
I want to make sure I'm full HD.

1383
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:06,100
Before I do anything.

1384
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:09,260
Guys.

1385
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:09,760
Yeah.

1386
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:11,300
Look, I was just...

1387
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:11,940
You know...

1388
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:14,060
I figured...

1389
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:18,880
I wanted to give other people more credit and share my credit.

1390
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:23,660
Because unlike some generals, I'm very humble.

1391
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:28,860
And like, I wanted other people to have their say in history.

1392
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:38,060
I'm just a very humble person.

1393
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:39,140
With all my might.

1394
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:40,300
Uh-huh.

1395
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:41,820
Yes, you are.

1396
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:46,940
How are people dying?

1397
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:48,400
I'm killing everyone.

1398
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:52,320
Okay, now...

1399
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:55,300
We are at three now.

1400
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:58,080
They call you...

1401
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:58,520
Exactly.

1402
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:00,000
I am the army of one.

1403
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,220
Okay, nice.

1404
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,760
Just want to make sure I get these guys first.

1405
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:06,740
Jesus.

1406
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,520
300 people was a lot more than I expected.

1407
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:10,520
I...

1408
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:12,000
I was not expecting.

1409
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:13,300
Who would have thought?

1410
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:15,800
300 people was a lot of people.

1411
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,000
My God.

1412
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:23,060
I was not aware.

1413
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:30,520
Oh my God.

1414
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:31,540
Who am I supposed to kill?

1415
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:33,680
Who am I?

1416
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:34,720
Am I supposed to kill him?

1417
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:38,120
Oh, I have to kill two of them.

1418
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:38,620
Okay.

1419
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:41,000
Okay, this is gonna...

1420
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:42,840
This is gonna be awkward.

1421
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:45,480
That's a lot.

1422
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:46,240
Two is a lot.

1423
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:48,120
Two is a lot more than I expected.

1424
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:50,440
Okay.

1425
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:52,720
Like, this took me a while to do.

1426
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:55,940
I won't give up.

1427
00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:56,460
This is it.

1428
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,020
Not while I still draw breath.

1429
00:56:58,420 --> 00:56:58,760
Gotcha.

1430
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:01,160
Guys, I'll fix the chat soon.

1431
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:02,020
I just need to kill him.

1432
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:02,620
Concentrate.

1433
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:03,720
You guys don't understand.

1434
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:05,020
This is...

1435
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:05,740
A lot.

1436
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:08,660
Okay, nice.

1437
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,080
Alright, I got one of them.

1438
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:13,600
The enemy officer...

1439
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:14,440
I shall retreat now.

1440
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:15,140
Has been defeated.

1441
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:16,140
Wait, did I...

1442
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:18,180
Okay, I got him.

1443
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,120
Where's the other guy?

1444
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,000
Oh, where's the other?

1445
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:25,660
Where's the other boss?

1446
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:27,740
Wait, where is he?

1447
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:28,700
I saw one more.

1448
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:29,340
Oh my god.

1449
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:30,220
He's all the way there.

1450
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,800
Why are you all the way there?

1451
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:34,060
I had an attack...

1452
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:37,420
Oh my god.

1453
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:37,900
Get over here.

1454
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:38,820
Get over here.

1455
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,100
Oh, you're gonna run?

1456
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:41,080
You are...

1457
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:41,720
Oh my god.

1458
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:42,920
I swear to god.

1459
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:43,800
I...

1460
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,700
I couldn't be of more assistance.

1461
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,800
I swear to god.

1462
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:50,360
Oh hey, all my guards fled.

1463
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:53,180
Okay.

1464
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:54,320
That's fine.

1465
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:55,160
I can do this in two minutes.

1466
00:57:58,580 --> 00:57:59,300
That's fine.

1467
00:57:59,600 --> 00:57:59,940
All my might.

1468
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:02,140
I can get you.

1469
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:04,060
All my might.

1470
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:05,320
Don't worry.

1471
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:06,000
I have more.

1472
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:07,660
All my might.

1473
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:07,720
All my might.

1474
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:09,440
Jesus, everybody is trying to come over.

1475
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:12,640
Oh my god.

1476
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:13,120
Please.

1477
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:16,360
Jesus.

1478
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:16,760
Okay.

1479
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:17,740
Now, guys.

1480
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:19,220
From no...

1481
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:20,340
No general stuff.

1482
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:20,920
Everything.

1483
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:22,100
Okay.

1484
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:22,500
Guys.

1485
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:23,280
You guys got it.

1486
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:23,780
Guys.

1487
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:24,860
Calm down.

1488
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:26,880
Calm down.

1489
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:27,960
Ow.

1490
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:28,600
Ow.

1491
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:30,140
There's so many general sales.

1492
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:32,300
What the fuck?

1493
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:34,660
I can't move.

1494
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:37,720
Oh my god.

1495
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:39,360
I actually...

1496
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:42,760
Okay.

1497
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:43,860
Okay.

1498
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:44,760
I give...

1499
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:45,700
I can't.

1500
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:46,440
I...

1501
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:49,020
I can't deal with this.

1502
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:49,880
I...

1503
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:51,400
I actually...

1504
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,620
I can't deal with that.

1505
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,120
That is like...

1506
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:55,940
That...

1507
00:58:55,940 --> 00:58:57,620
I have limits.

1508
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:58,340
Guys.

1509
00:58:58,980 --> 00:58:59,440
I...

1510
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,540
I have limits to this.

1511
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:02,580
Where's the...

1512
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:04,260
Where's the track...

1513
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:05,220
Thing.

1514
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:06,300
Where's the...

1515
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:06,520
Okay.

1516
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:07,960
There we go, there we go.

1517
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:24,680
Like, I... Like, like, that is actual... Sorry, but like, that had... That had to end right there.

1518
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:31,180
Alright, there we go.

1519
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:34,980
Time to get... Time to get serious.

1520
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:37,060
That was...

1521
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,700
That was a little bullshit.

1522
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:42,620
The enemy officer has been defeated.

1523
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:45,460
Like, I was not dealing with that anymore.

1524
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:52,040
I... I... I refuse to go through more of that.

1525
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:55,540
Okay, now I need to do a hundred more.

1526
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:57,940
Jesus, I thought I was getting close.

1527
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:00,520
It was all a lie.

1528
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:08,060
Okay, I need to build more.

1529
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:14,680
The only issue is that it takes so long to build... To build any of my focus thing for this.

1530
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:18,740
Oh my god, it takes fucking forever.

1531
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:24,220
Okay, let's see.

1532
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:25,640
Okay.

1533
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:27,420
That's fine.

1534
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:29,020
That's fine.

1535
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:30,400
I gotta make sure I don't get...

1536
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:32,580
I don't get rocked.

1537
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:34,720
Uh, saying thank you for the super chat.

1538
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:35,100
Thank you.

1539
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:35,700
Thank you.

1540
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:39,260
Any thoughts on... Uh, about Expedition 3D?

1541
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:40,980
Would love to see you play it, maybe?

1542
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:42,680
Is that the turn-based RPG?

1543
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:45,020
I know a lot of people say it's really good.

1544
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:50,660
But like, I'm... I'm not like a... I'm not really good at turn-based RPG games too.

1545
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:52,020
So like, I don't know.

1546
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:53,900
Um...

1547
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:56,100
I don't play a lot of turn-based RPG.

1548
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:58,100
I try to play Baldur's Gate.

1549
01:00:58,580 --> 01:01:01,560
But like, uh, for me, I think I only got to like...

1550
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:03,220
I think I played it for like...

1551
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:04,540
Two to three hours.

1552
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:05,380
And then I...

1553
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:06,040
I don't...

1554
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:07,300
I didn't keep playing it.

1555
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:08,320
But that's just me.

1556
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:10,520
That's just me personally.

1557
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:14,140
Okay.

1558
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:15,540
Yeah, Baldur's Gate is like...

1559
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:16,220
Not...

1560
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:16,740
Oh my god.

1561
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:18,460
Okay.

1562
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:20,780
Yeah, I have no idea.

1563
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:21,560
I don't know if I...

1564
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:23,080
I heard it's really, really...

1565
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:27,020
I will admit that I have heard that it's really, really, really good.

1566
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:27,780
Jesus.

1567
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:29,980
This is like an optional mission.

1568
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:31,640
How is...

1569
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:42,400
The fact that this is an optional mission and it's taking me like 20 years to fucking kill anybody?

1570
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:48,720
Oh my god.

1571
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:50,140
I feel like...

1572
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:52,320
This is gonna take me so long.

1573
01:01:56,530 --> 01:01:58,150
Okay, at least I punched him.

1574
01:01:58,870 --> 01:01:59,770
Oh my god.

1575
01:01:59,870 --> 01:02:00,370
He's coming back.

1576
01:02:00,630 --> 01:02:01,130
I don't...

1577
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:03,330
He's coming...

1578
01:02:03,330 --> 01:02:04,210
Oh my god.

1579
01:02:05,050 --> 01:02:05,630
Fine.

1580
01:02:05,630 --> 01:02:06,890
I got more ice in me.

1581
01:02:10,870 --> 01:02:11,490
Okay.

1582
01:02:13,890 --> 01:02:15,250
How is this taking...

1583
01:02:15,250 --> 01:02:16,010
What are they doing?

1584
01:02:16,470 --> 01:02:17,510
Why do they...

1585
01:02:17,510 --> 01:02:19,270
Why are they slowly...

1586
01:02:20,290 --> 01:02:21,410
Why are they...

1587
01:02:21,410 --> 01:02:24,390
Why are they slowly walking up to me?

1588
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:28,050
Like, you think I don't see you?

1589
01:02:30,890 --> 01:02:34,170
They are just walking menacingly.

1590
01:02:34,390 --> 01:02:35,710
I'll take this duel.

1591
01:02:36,190 --> 01:02:36,810
That's fine.

1592
01:02:36,950 --> 01:02:37,390
Let me swap.

1593
01:02:37,530 --> 01:02:38,070
Okay, wait.

1594
01:02:41,310 --> 01:02:41,870
Alright.

1595
01:02:41,870 --> 01:02:42,950
Give me a sec.

1596
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:43,350
I...

1597
01:02:43,350 --> 01:02:43,670
I...

1598
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:44,870
We are not doing...

1599
01:02:44,870 --> 01:02:45,470
Do it this duel.

1600
01:02:46,330 --> 01:02:48,630
We are not doing this duel with this weapon.

1601
01:02:48,830 --> 01:02:49,410
Give me a sec.

1602
01:02:50,090 --> 01:02:50,210
Bro.

1603
01:02:50,450 --> 01:02:51,010
Give me a sec.

1604
01:02:52,670 --> 01:02:53,510
Okay, nice.

1605
01:02:57,410 --> 01:02:58,170
Okay, nice.

1606
01:02:59,990 --> 01:03:00,730
Sorry, buddy.

1607
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:02,410
I refuse to do that one.

1608
01:03:04,430 --> 01:03:08,330
We are absolutely not doing that duel with this.

1609
01:03:09,150 --> 01:03:10,570
No matter what you want.

1610
01:03:10,710 --> 01:03:11,170
Yes.

1611
01:03:13,770 --> 01:03:14,370
Okay.

1612
01:03:15,190 --> 01:03:17,510
Shit, he takes so long.

1613
01:03:17,770 --> 01:03:18,390
Oh my god.

1614
01:03:18,530 --> 01:03:18,990
No, I got hit.

1615
01:03:19,450 --> 01:03:19,830
No!

1616
01:03:20,310 --> 01:03:21,330
My perfect...

1617
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:22,070
Oh my god.

1618
01:03:22,850 --> 01:03:24,790
Why do you take so long?

1619
01:03:26,090 --> 01:03:27,290
Oh my god.

1620
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:30,190
Jesus.

1621
01:03:32,510 --> 01:03:33,430
I'm trying!

1622
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:35,050
Take this.

1623
01:03:35,390 --> 01:03:36,010
I see it.

1624
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:37,790
He does so much!

1625
01:03:42,050 --> 01:03:42,810
Nice!

1626
01:03:43,190 --> 01:03:44,250
Oh, I just won it.

1627
01:03:44,450 --> 01:03:45,370
Let's end this.

1628
01:03:45,890 --> 01:03:46,350
Oh.

1629
01:03:47,370 --> 01:03:50,090
We were so close to perfect, but I did it.

1630
01:03:51,230 --> 01:03:52,630
You know what I get out of this?

1631
01:03:52,890 --> 01:03:54,990
Three more of you guys are going to die.

1632
01:03:59,630 --> 01:04:01,370
That's what I get out of it.

1633
01:04:02,570 --> 01:04:04,310
Three more dragoons.

1634
01:04:04,510 --> 01:04:06,670
That's just going to die anyway.

1635
01:04:09,030 --> 01:04:11,070
I love, I love dying.

1636
01:04:14,370 --> 01:04:16,650
Okay, that doesn't really matter that much to me.

1637
01:04:17,110 --> 01:04:18,170
Did I get this already?

1638
01:04:18,390 --> 01:04:19,030
I did, right?

1639
01:04:19,250 --> 01:04:19,550
I did.

1640
01:04:19,670 --> 01:04:20,530
It's like highlighted.

1641
01:04:21,590 --> 01:04:22,230
Okay, nice.

1642
01:04:22,630 --> 01:04:24,470
My life for aight.

1643
01:04:26,050 --> 01:04:27,890
Alright, let me fix chat real quick.

1644
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:35,180
That should fix it.

1645
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:38,300
That should fix it.

1646
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:38,780
Yeah, there we go.

1647
01:04:38,780 --> 01:04:40,100
Yay, see?

1648
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:41,780
I got three more of you guys.

1649
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:42,380
Let's go.

1650
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:49,160
Alright, nice.

1651
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:57,180
Uh, now I should be able to do the actual mission now.

1652
01:04:58,140 --> 01:04:58,700
Wah!

1653
01:04:59,160 --> 01:04:59,440
Wah!

1654
01:05:00,140 --> 01:05:01,960
Wait, Lube?

1655
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:03,880
Oh, I was supposed to talk to you.

1656
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:05,500
I was going to be like, what?

1657
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:07,320
I'm trying to do my mission, Lube.

1658
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:08,120
What do you want?

1659
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:10,220
Oh, hey.

1660
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:11,080
Us in a garden?

1661
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:18,280
In times of trouble, suffering, and sadness, you always manage to appear by my side.

1662
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:20,040
Oh, yeah.

1663
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:21,560
Like a guardian angel.

1664
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:24,000
It does seem that way, Lord Lube.

1665
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:24,900
Strange.

1666
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:28,140
But your help is always welcomed.

1667
01:05:28,620 --> 01:05:31,800
I'd really appreciate it if you listened to what I have to say.

1668
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:32,800
Yeah?

1669
01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:33,620
In the garden?

1670
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:34,800
Just the two of us?

1671
01:05:36,380 --> 01:05:37,340
And he's right.

1672
01:05:38,420 --> 01:05:40,180
I think I may be lost.

1673
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:41,800
A world...

1674
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:45,820
...where all people can choose their own path toward the future.

1675
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:50,200
I've declared time and again that this is the ideal world I wish to create.

1676
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:53,480
But I still have no idea how to make it a reality.

1677
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:58,600
You really are lost.

1678
01:05:58,920 --> 01:05:59,800
Me, don't worry.

1679
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:00,540
Me neither.

1680
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:01,680
I don't know what I'm doing.

1681
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:03,880
I'm playing Epic Mix next week.

1682
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:05,060
I shouldn't expect you to have the answer I need.

1683
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:09,560
This is something I'll need to take care of myself, after all.

1684
01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:11,740
As Quan, you said.

1685
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:16,080
We'll need someone to guide us if we want to find a solution to this problem.

1686
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:20,360
That's why we should start our search as soon as we possibly can.

1687
01:06:22,220 --> 01:06:23,020
For us...

1688
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:25,940
And for everyone else searching for their own path toward the future.

1689
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:27,200
But...

1690
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:29,580
Even if we did go to Jing...

1691
01:06:30,540 --> 01:06:33,260
Would we be able to find the sort of guide we seek?

1692
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:34,980
Oh wait, are we getting...

1693
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:35,900
Chu Got... Chu Got Learn?

1694
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:36,960
Chu Get Leon?

1695
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:39,960
Is that what we're trying to find?

1696
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:42,560
When our other rivals are gaining strength as we speak.

1697
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:45,940
I don't think we can afford to waste any more time here.

1698
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:49,760
But don't take my anxiety as a sign of wavering resolve.

1699
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:52,380
Oh my god, we're actually gonna have someone to think for us.

1700
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:55,160
Instead of just sending people to their deaths.

1701
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:58,000
This is the actual character development for him.

1702
01:06:58,300 --> 01:06:59,360
Our dreams again.

1703
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:04,640
His entire strategy was just...

1704
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:07,780
Send Guan Yun in there and then he'll kill everything.

1705
01:07:07,780 --> 01:07:09,120
But then like...

1706
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:11,240
90% of the army dies for it.

1707
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:12,220
Oh.

1708
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:14,140
Didn't expect to see you here.

1709
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:14,880
Hello.

1710
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:16,140
That's me.

1711
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:17,820
Who are you expecting?

1712
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:19,280
I thought it would be Zhao Yun.

1713
01:07:19,780 --> 01:07:22,680
I can't turn around without him asking to spar with me.

1714
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:24,500
Oh, he's trying to avoid him.

1715
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:26,700
But I never get bored of fighting.

1716
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:28,220
So, I don't mind.

1717
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:30,640
I've taken him on a few times now.

1718
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:33,440
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

1719
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:35,380
He has lost many...

1720
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:37,520
fights because of it.

1721
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:39,080
What do you mean?

1722
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:40,160
What do you mean?

1723
01:07:40,180 --> 01:07:43,600
Now we have a great lineup of strong fighters on our side.

1724
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:46,400
He has lost so many battles.

1725
01:07:50,540 --> 01:07:56,280
Guan Yun literally left to join Zhao Zhao because of him fucking up.

1726
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:56,540
But...

1727
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:00,400
I'm worried we won't see eye to eye.

1728
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:03,800
I learned how you work.

1729
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:04,800
Yeah, you're right.

1730
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:07,920
If they really are smart, they'll pick things up quick enough.

1731
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:10,700
So, I've got nothing to worry about.

1732
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:16,220
Whoever we bring into the fold, I just hope it's an honest person that I can get along with.

1733
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:23,680
Because there's nothing I hate more than a know-it-all with a smug look on his face telling everyone how right he is.

1734
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:27,160
Oh wait, I don't... I just don't think he likes smart people in general.

1735
01:08:27,580 --> 01:08:27,780
Report himself!

1736
01:08:27,780 --> 01:08:30,500
Zhao Zhao's forces are mounting an attack on us here on Runon.

1737
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:33,640
Please, make haste to the war room.

1738
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:35,820
He's not here to think!

1739
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:38,600
He's just here to unga bunga!

1740
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:39,040
Let's go!

1741
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,320
He's gonna be like... He's one of those guys, he's like, I can take on one gorilla.

1742
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:46,860
He's one of those guys.

1743
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:50,500
And he's absolutely right.

1744
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:55,320
Look at their strategy room!

1745
01:08:55,900 --> 01:08:57,960
Who is the strategist here?

1746
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:08,260
This is the strategist room and there's literally zero strategist.

1747
01:09:08,260 --> 01:09:10,040
They stand a chance against their main force.

1748
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:15,140
Heh, looks like they're not taking any chances with you on our side, brother.

1749
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:18,400
Why is there even a map?

1750
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:21,560
Does he plan to slaughter every last one of us?

1751
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:27,400
Perhaps this would be a good time for us to flee to Jing like you mentioned before, Lord Liu Bei.

1752
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:29,040
Agreed.

1753
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:34,000
The ruler of Jin, Lord Liu Biao, is a relative of Liu Bei's.

1754
01:09:34,860 --> 01:09:37,080
He will surely welcome us with open arms.

1755
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:38,140
Wait.

1756
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:45,500
Under these circumstances, going to Jing would end up making it the target of Cao Cao's attack, would it not?

1757
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:47,840
Oh my god, he's actually thinking about others.

1758
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:50,100
I will force great hardship upon Lord Liu Biao and the people of Jing.

1759
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:52,540
I think I'd rather...

1760
01:09:52,540 --> 01:09:55,040
You would rather throw your life away...

1761
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:56,060
No, no, no.

1762
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:58,640
He would rather throw all our lives away.

1763
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:00,240
That's different.

1764
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:01,540
Everything you want to achieve will die with you.

1765
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:03,980
Condemning the people to lives of despair.

1766
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:05,260
Quan Yu.

1767
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:08,900
You worry too much, brother.

1768
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:12,760
With a few more soldiers on our side, Cao Cao won't look so tough.

1769
01:10:13,860 --> 01:10:16,660
We'll make a stand in Jing and drive them back.

1770
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:17,780
Right, Zhao Yun?

1771
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:20,000
Yes.

1772
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:23,020
And I won't let them lay a finger on Lord Liu Bei.

1773
01:10:24,340 --> 01:10:27,540
As long as Lord Guan Yu is there, I don't care where we go.

1774
01:10:27,780 --> 01:10:29,640
I'll be right by his side no matter what.

1775
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:31,200
Oh my god, he's number one Oshii.

1776
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:32,940
Brother, our hearts are set on Jing.

1777
01:10:33,660 --> 01:10:34,800
But the choice is yours.

1778
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:36,780
The tier 3 sub.

1779
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:39,740
You just can't let me give up and die in peace, can you?

1780
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:44,800
Do you think 100 dragoons could beat one gorilla, Dogey?

1781
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:46,900
But stop, thank you for the super chat.

1782
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:47,940
Thank you, thank you.

1783
01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:50,080
That's, that's a funny joke, guys.

1784
01:10:50,820 --> 01:10:51,360
At the...

1785
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:53,420
Have only one Oorn to give before we go.

1786
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:55,800
Everyone must survive this journey.

1787
01:10:56,580 --> 01:10:58,920
Now, prepare to depart.

1788
01:11:05,180 --> 01:11:06,420
Alright, where do we go?

1789
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:07,500
Bada, Runan.

1790
01:11:07,820 --> 01:11:08,100
Okay.

1791
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:09,820
Oh, it's literally right here.

1792
01:11:10,220 --> 01:11:11,360
Oh, that's convenient.

1793
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:16,000
Oh, they're talking about Pantong and Jukaland.

1794
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:17,000
You must have earned them.

1795
01:11:19,580 --> 01:11:20,680
Alright, nice.

1796
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:21,860
Alright, I got a...

1797
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:22,680
Yoink, mine now.

1798
01:11:22,940 --> 01:11:23,260
Oh, wait.

1799
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:24,900
Yoink, mine now.

1800
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:27,440
Alright, let's go fight.

1801
01:11:37,420 --> 01:11:40,180
I like how there's zero strategists in this room.

1802
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:46,600
We had a strong one to form a Runan castle, but Tata has invaded with a large army.

1803
01:11:46,860 --> 01:11:48,700
We cannot expect to hold the castle.

1804
01:11:48,980 --> 01:11:51,340
So we have no choice but to flee the Jing province.

1805
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:56,040
What managed the most right now is not the land or the castle, but the people.

1806
01:11:56,380 --> 01:11:58,660
I want everyone to escape, no exceptions.

1807
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:02,420
However, compared to their vast force, we have barely a handful of soldiers.

1808
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:04,920
I've never faced a battle quite like this.

1809
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:05,820
So what do we do?

1810
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:08,020
What do we do, guys?

1811
01:12:08,020 --> 01:12:09,760
Anyone that can think?

1812
01:12:09,940 --> 01:12:10,880
Neither do I.

1813
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:12,140
Nor I.

1814
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:14,000
And I'm not ashamed to admit it either.

1815
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:17,120
What should I do, Doki?

1816
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:17,960
Not Doki?

1817
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:23,220
As a warrior, you have run fire and riot.

1818
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:26,460
Perhaps you found yourself in similar circumstances.

1819
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:29,160
You see things in a way the rest of us cannot.

1820
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:32,620
Why not take command and find us a way up?

1821
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:34,040
That's...

1822
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:34,560
Aw, man.

1823
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:37,240
That's...

1824
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:37,320
Aw.

1825
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:39,940
They think I stink when I play this game?

1826
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:40,940
I don't.

1827
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:45,680
Leave it to me, guys!

1828
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:47,860
I'm grateful.

1829
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:52,320
Their fates are in my hands now!

1830
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:55,100
I'm the strategist now!

1831
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:56,760
Is it...

1832
01:12:56,760 --> 01:13:00,280
Would you trust me to be your strategist, guys?

1833
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:06,360
Oh!

1834
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:06,700
Oh!

1835
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:08,380
Their fate is a...

1836
01:13:08,380 --> 01:13:10,360
Is in my hands!

1837
01:13:14,020 --> 01:13:16,680
Can I at least write my will?!

1838
01:13:16,940 --> 01:13:17,480
Oh!

1839
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:18,220
That's funny!

1840
01:13:18,220 --> 01:13:25,420
I mean, every time I bring my dragoons over here, I somehow ended up with zero dragoons every time.

1841
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:28,460
But their fate is in my hands.

1842
01:13:32,020 --> 01:13:35,400
I know what I am up for.

1843
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:39,220
That's okay, I believe.

1844
01:13:45,260 --> 01:13:46,180
That's right.

1845
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:48,140
Follow me, everyone!

1846
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:50,100
Let's go!

1847
01:13:58,880 --> 01:13:59,960
Wait, don't wait!

1848
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:01,640
I can't deal when they're all separated!

1849
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:02,340
What do you mean?

1850
01:14:05,660 --> 01:14:08,260
The whole plan is for them to be with me!

1851
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:14,500
Okay, we'll fight all of these guys together.

1852
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:16,480
Guys, no, we go this way.

1853
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:18,280
Guys, no, we go this way, guys.

1854
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:20,480
Guys, no, no, no, guys!

1855
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:24,580
Guys, guys, I thought we all follow me!

1856
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:30,360
Guys, what happened?

1857
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:36,360
Wait, one of you already died?

1858
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:37,040
How?

1859
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:41,260
How did one of you guys already died?

1860
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:44,220
I'm not going to let my guard down for a second.

1861
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:49,760
Wait, how did one of you guys already died?

1862
01:14:50,180 --> 01:14:51,280
I wouldn't let us escape so easily.

1863
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:53,580
Wait, four of you guys died?!

1864
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:56,000
Oh, we're hungry!

1865
01:14:58,420 --> 01:14:59,440
Does it make sense?

1866
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:04,180
Okay, thanks.

1867
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:07,980
Okay, I was told that all of you guys have to live.

1868
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:08,780
Like, what the fuck?

1869
01:15:13,740 --> 01:15:15,620
Oh my god, I'm still trying to kill him.

1870
01:15:16,580 --> 01:15:18,140
I'm still trying to kill this guy.

1871
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:22,920
All right, get out of here.

1872
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:32,240
All right, get out of here!

1873
01:15:33,340 --> 01:15:34,100
That's right!

1874
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:36,380
I can't believe the enemy officer has been defeated.

1875
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:39,000
Guys, I don't think I can save all of them anymore.

1876
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:39,720
I...

1877
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:42,660
There is...

1878
01:15:42,660 --> 01:15:45,400
There is a chance that not all of them are going to live.

1879
01:15:46,340 --> 01:15:46,680
How?

1880
01:15:47,020 --> 01:15:50,660
Guys, what did we say about not splitting up?

1881
01:15:50,860 --> 01:15:51,040
Yes.

1882
01:15:51,340 --> 01:15:52,540
What did we say?

1883
01:15:57,260 --> 01:15:58,300
I don't...

1884
01:15:58,300 --> 01:15:58,860
We...

1885
01:16:00,460 --> 01:16:02,040
We said we shouldn't...

1886
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:02,860
Split up!

1887
01:16:03,380 --> 01:16:05,680
Why is everyone splitting up?!

1888
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:11,360
What do you mean, Lupe?!

1889
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:13,820
You are literally the one guy that you should not be dying.

1890
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:19,420
The whole plan...

1891
01:16:19,420 --> 01:16:20,960
Lupe is now...

1892
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:22,780
Where are you advancing, Lupe?

1893
01:16:23,220 --> 01:16:24,760
Where are you advancing?

1894
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:26,620
We are still fighting this fight.

1895
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:29,220
You are not advancing anywhere.

1896
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:31,000
Oh my god!

1897
01:16:31,340 --> 01:16:31,660
Who?

1898
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:32,120
Who?

1899
01:16:32,140 --> 01:16:32,600
He's dying!

1900
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:34,700
Okay, if he dies, that's fine.

1901
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:35,400
I just need to know.

1902
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:37,600
I need to know if he...

1903
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:38,060
If he...

1904
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:39,940
I need to know, like, what happens when he...

1905
01:16:39,940 --> 01:16:40,600
Do I lose?

1906
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:43,860
He successfully divided their forces.

1907
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:48,960
Oh, he's dead.

1908
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:49,500
Okay.

1909
01:16:51,780 --> 01:16:52,640
I lose.

1910
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:54,780
I will ever fulfill my purpose.

1911
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:57,740
He left himself!

1912
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:00,940
He fucking left himself!

1913
01:17:03,740 --> 01:17:05,360
Guys, let's split up, gang!

1914
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:07,440
All right.

1915
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:11,480
Like, I have to go from the beginning?!

1916
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:12,780
Oh my god.

1917
01:17:14,340 --> 01:17:16,060
I killed so many.

1918
01:17:16,060 --> 01:17:18,620
I have no need for kingdoms or...

1919
01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:20,400
Like, how is this my fault?!

1920
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:21,480
He left!

1921
01:17:25,580 --> 01:17:26,140
How...

1922
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:28,680
How could this be my fault?!

1923
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:30,620
The last one of us must escape safely.

1924
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:33,460
Okay.

1925
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:36,980
You have a keen eye for the battlefield.

1926
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:39,860
I'm...

1927
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:41,580
I'm not...

1928
01:17:41,580 --> 01:17:42,800
I'm not doing this.

1929
01:17:42,940 --> 01:17:43,320
I'm...

1930
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:46,000
I'm not...

1931
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,100
I'm not doing this, guys.

1932
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:50,900
All right.

1933
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:53,580
We'll put this up here.

1934
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:57,580
I'm not doing this anymore.

1935
01:17:57,820 --> 01:17:59,800
I'm not doing that stupid mission.

1936
01:18:02,660 --> 01:18:03,260
I'm not doing this.

1937
01:18:03,260 --> 01:18:03,520
Let's just...

1938
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:05,920
Let's just complete this.

1939
01:18:12,140 --> 01:18:12,740
Um...

1940
01:18:12,740 --> 01:18:13,280
I'm...

1941
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:15,400
I'm not dealing with that anymore.

1942
01:18:17,140 --> 01:18:23,600
I can't imagine Liu Bei putting up much of a fight, but I'll defer to Lord Guojia on this magical.

1943
01:18:24,540 --> 01:18:25,120
Nice.

1944
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:29,160
Oh my god, not again.

1945
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:30,600
I'll run right over and push them back.

1946
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:30,780
Okay.

1947
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:31,580
We'll...

1948
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:33,180
We'll deal with him soon, guys.

1949
01:18:33,620 --> 01:18:34,960
I just gotta make sure...

1950
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:37,060
that I can live through all of...

1951
01:18:37,060 --> 01:18:38,060
I just gotta make sure to...

1952
01:18:38,060 --> 01:18:38,780
kill...

1953
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:40,920
do as much damage as I can...

1954
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:41,740
before...

1955
01:18:41,740 --> 01:18:42,660
this fucker...

1956
01:18:43,340 --> 01:18:44,040
leaves us.

1957
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:46,300
We therefore should not be underestimated.

1958
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,800
We will follow our orders without fail.

1959
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:52,900
You know full well what we're up against here.

1960
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:56,000
And I'm not going to let my guard down for a second.

1961
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:56,820
Okay.

1962
01:18:57,540 --> 01:18:58,880
Let me kill him first.

1963
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:00,760
It'll be worth it, guys.

1964
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:02,420
I just...

1965
01:19:02,420 --> 01:19:03,240
let me kill him first.

1966
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:07,160
Don't worry, he'll live.

1967
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:07,600
I...

1968
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:08,800
I believe in him.

1969
01:19:14,460 --> 01:19:15,040
All right.

1970
01:19:15,220 --> 01:19:16,460
I knew they wouldn't let us escape.

1971
01:19:16,620 --> 01:19:17,080
All right.

1972
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:17,460
Let's go.

1973
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,840
Let's go save that fucker.

1974
01:19:20,180 --> 01:19:21,980
You can't allow them to surround us.

1975
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:22,820
Okay.

1976
01:19:23,020 --> 01:19:23,820
Where is he?

1977
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:25,900
Where is he?

1978
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:29,300
Oh my God.

1979
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:31,000
Let's go.

1980
01:19:31,260 --> 01:19:33,240
Our orders are to attack them incessantly.

1981
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:35,440
Sounds good to me.

1982
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:36,180
He is so far.

1983
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:37,320
He is.

1984
01:19:37,540 --> 01:19:38,820
He is so far.

1985
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:41,520
I swear to God.

1986
01:19:48,420 --> 01:19:49,960
Get out of here.

1987
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:51,560
Oh my God.

1988
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:52,460
I used the wrong attack.

1989
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:54,060
I was supposed to use the ice one.

1990
01:19:54,380 --> 01:19:55,680
When meet again we shall.

1991
01:19:56,860 --> 01:19:57,380
Good.

1992
01:19:58,400 --> 01:19:59,600
The path is clear.

1993
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:01,620
Let's go.

1994
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:03,320
I swear to God.

1995
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:04,620
If you also split up...

1996
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:05,720
If you are...

1997
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:07,180
I swear to God.

1998
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:11,100
If you also split up, I swear to God.

1999
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:11,460
Stop the enemy.

2000
01:20:11,740 --> 01:20:13,160
And protect Liu Bei.

2001
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:13,660
Take this.

2002
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:15,220
Lord Liu Bei.

2003
01:20:15,940 --> 01:20:18,040
I have returned to my place.

2004
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:18,400
All right.

2005
01:20:18,940 --> 01:20:20,000
Are you done?

2006
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:20,820
Are you done?

2007
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:21,400
Oh my God.

2008
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:22,800
Where is he going?

2009
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:23,860
Let's go.

2010
01:20:23,860 --> 01:20:24,300
He...

2011
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:25,200
He...

2012
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:25,680
He...

2013
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:27,540
He like...

2014
01:20:27,540 --> 01:20:28,440
Lashed.

2015
01:20:28,780 --> 01:20:29,280
I...

2016
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:33,560
I ended up fighting the guy he was trying to fight and then he ran away.

2017
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:36,400
I'll clear a path with my own two hands.

2018
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:37,240
I do arrows here.

2019
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:40,060
And then every single one of us will escape with our lives.

2020
01:20:40,180 --> 01:20:40,640
Oh my God.

2021
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:41,880
Forward march.

2022
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:42,660
Oh my God.

2023
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:43,860
Is this a successful ambush?

2024
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:45,040
Oh my God.

2025
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:45,840
I swear to God.

2026
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:46,600
Did I do it?

2027
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:48,860
Oh my God.

2028
01:20:48,940 --> 01:20:49,380
I fought.

2029
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:50,440
Oh my God.

2030
01:20:50,580 --> 01:20:51,240
The big...

2031
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:52,080
The high ground.

2032
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:53,780
I did it guys.

2033
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:55,580
I did it.

2034
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,460
I accomplished it.

2035
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:58,440
Time to act.

2036
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:00,460
You're an absolute worst nightmare.

2037
01:21:01,180 --> 01:21:02,780
I finally did it.

2038
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:05,380
I did an actual strategy.

2039
01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:08,220
The enemy officer has been defeated.

2040
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:09,760
Oh my God.

2041
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:10,720
It is possible.

2042
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:12,940
I can strategize.

2043
01:21:13,100 --> 01:21:14,220
At least in part.

2044
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:18,200
The strength of Liu Bei's officers is not to be taken lightly.

2045
01:21:19,180 --> 01:21:19,320
Okay.

2046
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:20,000
Nevertheless.

2047
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:23,360
We can use this division to our advantage.

2048
01:21:23,860 --> 01:21:26,200
We'll overwhelm them with greater numbers.

2049
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:27,840
Okay.

2050
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:28,020
Nice.

2051
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:31,200
The enemy officer has been defeated.

2052
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:31,520
Oh my God.

2053
01:21:31,580 --> 01:21:32,200
There's so many.

2054
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:36,480
There's so many of them that's trying to kill us.

2055
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:38,140
Who do I kill first?

2056
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:43,640
I don't know who to attack first.

2057
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:44,720
There's so many of them.

2058
01:21:48,460 --> 01:21:48,980
Okay.

2059
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:50,180
This one first.

2060
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:51,980
Get right here.

2061
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:54,640
Nice.

2062
01:21:56,740 --> 01:21:57,260
Alright.

2063
01:21:58,700 --> 01:21:59,740
And then...

2064
01:21:59,740 --> 01:22:00,080
Oh my God.

2065
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:00,380
Lupe.

2066
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:00,900
Please.

2067
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:01,800
Who are you fighting?

2068
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:03,600
Who are you fighting, Lupe?

2069
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:04,540
I don't understand.

2070
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:06,120
Who are you fighting?

2071
01:22:06,540 --> 01:22:07,600
We're all here.

2072
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:07,740
Where?

2073
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:08,920
Together!

2074
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:09,880
Okay.

2075
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:10,700
Let me hit him first.

2076
01:22:11,380 --> 01:22:11,520
Okay.

2077
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:12,660
We got...

2078
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:13,700
Where?

2079
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:21,820
I don't...

2080
01:22:21,820 --> 01:22:22,780
I don't know.

2081
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:26,180
I sense the bond between his strengthens.

2082
01:22:27,180 --> 01:22:28,180
We're all together.

2083
01:22:28,180 --> 01:22:29,400
How are you losing?

2084
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:32,880
Okay.

2085
01:22:35,740 --> 01:22:36,500
Nice.

2086
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:36,880
Nice.

2087
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:39,800
Nice.

2088
01:22:40,180 --> 01:22:40,580
Yeah.

2089
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:41,180
Thank God.

2090
01:22:42,180 --> 01:22:44,400
Thank God I decided to like...

2091
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:47,500
Thank God I decided to like actually...

2092
01:22:48,820 --> 01:22:50,420
Use an actual weapon.

2093
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:52,600
Versus one of the fuck weapon I had.

2094
01:22:55,700 --> 01:22:56,300
Nice.

2095
01:22:56,300 --> 01:22:56,380
Nice.

2096
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:57,840
Okay.

2097
01:22:58,180 --> 01:22:58,540
Got him.

2098
01:23:00,860 --> 01:23:01,680
Alright, Guanyi.

2099
01:23:01,740 --> 01:23:02,200
Do your thing.

2100
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:03,660
Or Zhaoyun.

2101
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:04,220
Do your thing.

2102
01:23:05,140 --> 01:23:06,400
Zhaoyun and Zhaoyun.

2103
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:07,740
Who will win?

2104
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:08,900
I knew I could count on you.

2105
01:23:09,140 --> 01:23:09,540
Go on.

2106
01:23:09,820 --> 01:23:12,100
The enemy officer has been defeated.

2107
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:13,700
There we go.

2108
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:16,260
We took that path without most people.

2109
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:19,480
Nice.

2110
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:21,540
The enemy officer has been defeated.

2111
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:22,700
Take this.

2112
01:23:22,980 --> 01:23:24,400
I don't see anything out of this.

2113
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:25,440
What do you mean?

2114
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:28,560
I just killed 20 people Zhaoyun.

2115
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:30,140
Oh fuck.

2116
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:31,900
We're next to each other.

2117
01:23:32,700 --> 01:23:32,860
Wait.

2118
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:39,020
He's like, I need help.

2119
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:41,280
Won't anybody help me?

2120
01:23:41,460 --> 01:23:43,580
And we're literally right next to each other.

2121
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:45,900
Why are I...

2122
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:47,380
My generals, we...

2123
01:23:47,380 --> 01:23:48,480
Guys, we need help.

2124
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:52,900
We need someone to think for us.

2125
01:23:53,180 --> 01:23:53,900
Please.

2126
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:55,240
Anyone.

2127
01:23:58,180 --> 01:24:00,100
Someone think for us.

2128
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:00,860
Please.

2129
01:24:02,260 --> 01:24:05,060
We can't keep doing this, guys.

2130
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:08,520
Oh my god.

2131
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:10,560
And they decided to go the long way.

2132
01:24:11,020 --> 01:24:12,020
Okay, guys.

2133
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:18,040
They decided to go the long way.

2134
01:24:18,820 --> 01:24:19,960
Okay, guys.

2135
01:24:21,020 --> 01:24:21,300
Alright.

2136
01:24:22,220 --> 01:24:23,880
What happened to like...

2137
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:24,420
Don't worry.

2138
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:25,360
I'll follow.

2139
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:26,320
Not Doki.

2140
01:24:27,170 --> 01:24:29,320
We'll let her decide what to do.

2141
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:30,760
What happened to that?

2142
01:24:30,860 --> 01:24:32,060
I missed those times.

2143
01:24:32,460 --> 01:24:34,040
I missed when they were like...

2144
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:34,820
We'll follow her.

2145
01:24:38,060 --> 01:24:39,420
Okay, I need to swap.

2146
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:40,980
I think I can use the gauntlets now.

2147
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:42,120
I like kill 20...

2148
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:43,040
20 men.

2149
01:24:43,340 --> 01:24:45,060
I should be allowed to use this now.

2150
01:24:51,400 --> 01:24:52,000
There we go.

2151
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:57,580
There we go.

2152
01:24:57,740 --> 01:24:58,240
There we go.

2153
01:24:58,480 --> 01:24:59,560
That should give me like...

2154
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:00,620
A lot of kills, right?

2155
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:01,680
Nice.

2156
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:07,660
Alright.

2157
01:25:08,140 --> 01:25:09,880
We're in the real place.

2158
01:25:12,380 --> 01:25:13,120
Okay, nice.

2159
01:25:13,700 --> 01:25:14,140
Wait, who...

2160
01:25:14,140 --> 01:25:14,700
Oh, there he is.

2161
01:25:14,780 --> 01:25:15,140
I was like...

2162
01:25:15,140 --> 01:25:16,340
Why is there still like...

2163
01:25:16,340 --> 01:25:17,080
People I need a kill?

2164
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:19,140
I realize he's right here.

2165
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:20,280
Yeah!

2166
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:28,260
This is it.

2167
01:25:29,020 --> 01:25:29,640
This is it.

2168
01:25:29,700 --> 01:25:31,020
This is how I'm gonna get my...

2169
01:25:31,020 --> 01:25:31,880
300 kills.

2170
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:33,180
Right here.

2171
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:35,760
So what am I going to do?

2172
01:25:35,940 --> 01:25:36,640
Right here.

2173
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:37,300
So what am I going to do?

2174
01:25:37,300 --> 01:25:39,360
The world is not large enough for both...

2175
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:40,260
I need all of this.

2176
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:41,440
And Lord Cao Cao.

2177
01:25:42,100 --> 01:25:43,720
Give me those 300 kills!

2178
01:25:44,420 --> 01:25:46,260
Before you gain too much power.

2179
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:51,220
Your overestimation of my ambition is becoming tiresome.

2180
01:25:51,860 --> 01:25:55,100
But I refuse to be defeated before making my mark on the world.

2181
01:25:55,100 --> 01:25:55,660
Can't get up.

2182
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:56,420
I'm going...

2183
01:25:57,300 --> 01:25:59,560
You think I'm gonna ignore you too?

2184
01:25:59,900 --> 01:26:00,520
That's right.

2185
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:04,800
That's right.

2186
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:06,120
That's right.

2187
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:07,080
You thought this was it?

2188
01:26:10,780 --> 01:26:11,320
Nice.

2189
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:16,100
Oh, I came back for you.

2190
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:21,200
Wait, I shielded it.

2191
01:26:22,460 --> 01:26:23,120
Yeah, nice.

2192
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:27,080
I don't like how loud that gets.

2193
01:26:31,420 --> 01:26:32,800
Oh my god, whoops.

2194
01:26:33,620 --> 01:26:34,220
Whoops.

2195
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:36,280
You know what?

2196
01:26:36,620 --> 01:26:38,160
I believe in you guys.

2197
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:39,500
Oh yeah, you can definitely get it.

2198
01:26:39,980 --> 01:26:40,480
There you go.

2199
01:26:40,780 --> 01:26:41,180
Kill him.

2200
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:48,160
That's not overkill, right?

2201
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:53,060
You did it.

2202
01:26:53,220 --> 01:26:54,360
You hit him.

2203
01:26:54,620 --> 01:26:56,700
I'm so proud of you guys.

2204
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:59,240
You actually hit him.

2205
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:02,880
I was gonna be like, will you miss?

2206
01:27:03,140 --> 01:27:04,140
Let's find out.

2207
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:05,700
We did it.

2208
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:07,720
You did the bare minimum.

2209
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:09,480
I'm so proud of you guys.

2210
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:12,560
It's everything I've always wanted.

2211
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:15,220
I cannot allow him to escape here.

2212
01:27:19,330 --> 01:27:20,010
Can't say it.

2213
01:27:20,130 --> 01:27:21,010
Thank you for the super chat.

2214
01:27:21,190 --> 01:27:21,430
Thank you.

2215
01:27:21,550 --> 01:27:22,050
Thank you.

2216
01:27:22,270 --> 01:27:24,990
Poor Doki is having to fill the strategist role even.

2217
01:27:27,490 --> 01:27:29,470
What do you mean?

2218
01:27:30,490 --> 01:27:32,190
What do you mean?

2219
01:27:32,630 --> 01:27:33,270
Why?

2220
01:27:36,050 --> 01:27:37,510
Why did you diverge?

2221
01:27:40,330 --> 01:27:40,970
Why did you diverge?

2222
01:27:40,970 --> 01:27:41,890
Hold on, hold on.

2223
01:27:42,390 --> 01:27:43,710
What are you coming after these for?

2224
01:27:44,090 --> 01:27:45,710
I'm warming with your time.

2225
01:27:46,370 --> 01:27:48,470
Why did you diverge?

2226
01:27:49,390 --> 01:27:50,090
Take this.

2227
01:27:58,650 --> 01:28:00,270
Jesus Christ.

2228
01:28:02,850 --> 01:28:04,250
Oh my god.

2229
01:28:04,590 --> 01:28:06,290
Oh my god.

2230
01:28:06,830 --> 01:28:08,970
You can't do anything, right?

2231
01:28:10,710 --> 01:28:12,410
I got the wrong one.

2232
01:28:12,410 --> 01:28:14,290
To cross the river here.

2233
01:28:15,130 --> 01:28:15,930
Lord knew that.

2234
01:28:16,450 --> 01:28:17,510
Please watch your step.

2235
01:28:19,570 --> 01:28:20,610
Take this.

2236
01:28:22,550 --> 01:28:24,770
I knew they'd be here.

2237
01:28:25,030 --> 01:28:26,710
Oh my god, okay.

2238
01:28:27,690 --> 01:28:28,730
Okay, there we go.

2239
01:28:29,670 --> 01:28:30,570
There we go.

2240
01:28:30,770 --> 01:28:33,670
Okay, now we should be fine, right?

2241
01:28:33,670 --> 01:28:34,970
We made it through.

2242
01:28:35,650 --> 01:28:36,450
Let's hurry.

2243
01:28:36,650 --> 01:28:39,650
If we don't move fast, they'll be right on top of us.

2244
01:28:40,510 --> 01:28:41,450
Do what?

2245
01:28:46,340 --> 01:28:48,520
Strike while the enemy is stumbling.

2246
01:28:49,860 --> 01:28:51,880
Oh my god, it's him.

2247
01:28:52,510 --> 01:28:55,300
No, he's less fabulous though.

2248
01:28:56,750 --> 01:28:57,520
Wait, what?

2249
01:28:58,720 --> 01:29:00,250
What the fuck?

2250
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:01,300
I...

2251
01:29:03,740 --> 01:29:05,100
What happened?

2252
01:29:05,700 --> 01:29:08,190
I turned around for one second.

2253
01:29:10,730 --> 01:29:11,680
What happened?

2254
01:29:13,900 --> 01:29:16,580
Oh my god, what do I have to deal with now?

2255
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:24,560
Took you long enough.

2256
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:27,960
Okay, thank god.

2257
01:29:28,120 --> 01:29:29,140
Okay, he's doing something right.

2258
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:30,480
Oh, thank god.

2259
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:34,560
Okay.

2260
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:36,120
Okay, that's good.

2261
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:37,120
He's doing something right.

2262
01:29:37,460 --> 01:29:38,300
That's good.

2263
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:40,080
Okay.

2264
01:29:42,660 --> 01:29:43,560
That's fine.

2265
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:45,580
That's fine.

2266
01:29:46,580 --> 01:29:48,600
Oh my god, Jesus.

2267
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:49,660
Okay.

2268
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:52,220
Okay, we're not gonna use Guanyu yet.

2269
01:29:52,540 --> 01:29:54,300
We're saving Guanyu for Tau Tau.

2270
01:29:58,660 --> 01:30:00,020
Jesus Christ.

2271
01:30:04,460 --> 01:30:04,800
Okay.

2272
01:30:06,420 --> 01:30:07,540
I missed one.

2273
01:30:07,720 --> 01:30:10,040
Oh wait, his weapon's a spear now?

2274
01:30:10,860 --> 01:30:11,540
Really?

2275
01:30:12,660 --> 01:30:13,340
Aww.

2276
01:30:15,460 --> 01:30:16,140
I'm sad.

2277
01:30:16,140 --> 01:30:18,420
I liked his claws more.

2278
01:30:18,540 --> 01:30:20,220
His claws was so cool.

2279
01:30:21,140 --> 01:30:22,600
Like, honestly.

2280
01:30:24,140 --> 01:30:26,100
Yeah, they got rid of his...

2281
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:28,220
They got rid of his, like, claws!

2282
01:30:28,820 --> 01:30:30,080
That shit was so cool!

2283
01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:31,420
It should be rather difficult.

2284
01:30:31,980 --> 01:30:33,700
We'll have to go after them ourselves.

2285
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:34,740
Jeff's fear!

2286
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:35,680
Now advance!

2287
01:30:35,940 --> 01:30:39,300
They added realism in my fantasy warriors game!

2288
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:44,220
I miss when they use fans to fight!

2289
01:30:44,220 --> 01:30:45,100
I...

2290
01:30:46,180 --> 01:30:46,520
I...

2291
01:30:47,060 --> 01:30:50,660
Do you remember when they would use fans?

2292
01:30:51,660 --> 01:30:53,840
Those were the good old days!

2293
01:30:55,960 --> 01:30:57,880
I can't believe it!

2294
01:30:58,080 --> 01:31:03,040
If they were gonna give me romance, then I should be able to be fabulous!

2295
01:31:04,240 --> 01:31:04,900
Alright, nice!

2296
01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:06,320
Come on!

2297
01:31:06,460 --> 01:31:07,200
Come on!

2298
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:09,640
What are you waiting for?

2299
01:31:09,780 --> 01:31:11,300
Let's get this fight started!

2300
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:13,540
He lost his beauty.

2301
01:31:14,140 --> 01:31:15,160
He really did.

2302
01:31:15,580 --> 01:31:16,820
He's not as...

2303
01:31:16,820 --> 01:31:18,580
He's not as fabulous now.

2304
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:21,140
True!

2305
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:23,200
Oh my...

2306
01:31:24,540 --> 01:31:31,820
All I'm saying is that if I'm gonna have romance in here, I should be allowed to have, like, giant ass...

2307
01:31:32,440 --> 01:31:32,860
Oh wait, what...

2308
01:31:32,860 --> 01:31:33,420
Where are they going?

2309
01:31:34,180 --> 01:31:35,660
Where are we trying to fight these guys?

2310
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:37,220
Okay, we'll fight in a while.

2311
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:37,840
Yeah, that's right.

2312
01:31:37,980 --> 01:31:38,860
What you gonna do?

2313
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:40,760
I'll body block you!

2314
01:31:40,940 --> 01:31:42,360
Oh, they're just gonna walk?

2315
01:31:43,700 --> 01:31:46,880
I like how we're just all waiting here for him!

2316
01:31:47,340 --> 01:31:48,860
What the...

2317
01:31:48,860 --> 01:31:49,900
Don't worry!

2318
01:31:52,900 --> 01:31:55,840
I shall guard the...

2319
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:57,340
But they can't...

2320
01:31:57,340 --> 01:31:59,960
They actually can't do anything here!

2321
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:02,100
That's actually fun!

2322
01:32:03,180 --> 01:32:04,620
Domain expansion!

2323
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:07,620
Oh, I have to wait for these guys too!

2324
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:08,880
Give me a sec!

2325
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:10,320
Give me...

2326
01:32:10,640 --> 01:32:11,740
Give me a sec!

2327
01:32:12,120 --> 01:32:13,600
I'm gonna wait for them!

2328
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:14,320
Dude!

2329
01:32:16,060 --> 01:32:17,140
Domain expansion!

2330
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:19,000
Get over here!

2331
01:32:19,780 --> 01:32:20,800
Get over here!

2332
01:32:25,580 --> 01:32:26,780
That's right!

2333
01:32:27,480 --> 01:32:30,260
They can't do anything too!

2334
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:33,180
That's so funny!

2335
01:32:34,040 --> 01:32:35,720
That's so dumb!

2336
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:38,020
I did it, guys!

2337
01:32:39,180 --> 01:32:40,280
Don't worry!

2338
01:32:40,700 --> 01:32:42,380
What are you gonna do now?

2339
01:32:42,380 --> 01:32:42,520
Wow!

2340
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:44,560
No!

2341
01:32:44,720 --> 01:32:45,100
Wait!

2342
01:32:45,580 --> 01:32:46,500
Oh my...

2343
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:46,980
No!

2344
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:48,860
I can't even do anything!

2345
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:51,700
We'll slowly walk over!

2346
01:32:53,620 --> 01:32:55,560
Oh my god!

2347
01:32:55,560 --> 01:32:56,180
You got a good relationship!

2348
01:32:56,780 --> 01:32:57,060
Take this!

2349
01:32:57,540 --> 01:32:58,080
Okay...

2350
01:32:58,080 --> 01:33:00,800
Turbent times dictate such things...

2351
01:33:02,120 --> 01:33:02,820
Okay...

2352
01:33:02,820 --> 01:33:03,560
That's fine...

2353
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:05,980
So we have a duel then!

2354
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:07,480
Be warned.

2355
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:09,500
I shall not hold back!

2356
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:11,300
Okay...

2357
01:33:11,300 --> 01:33:11,560
All that!

2358
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:11,820
Oh my...

2359
01:33:12,540 --> 01:33:13,240
All that!

2360
01:33:13,240 --> 01:33:13,620
That's fine!

2361
01:33:14,460 --> 01:33:15,500
That's fine...

2362
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:21,620
I just love how... That's so dumb.

2363
01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:24,620
That's actually so dumb.

2364
01:33:28,260 --> 01:33:29,180
Okay, nice.

2365
01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:32,960
There we go.

2366
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:34,000
Nice, we got the other one.

2367
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:35,820
It's just Tau Tau.

2368
01:33:38,220 --> 01:33:40,240
Okay, I think we win this now.

2369
01:33:40,680 --> 01:33:42,200
I think we just won.

2370
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:44,580
We literally killed Tau Tau.

2371
01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:46,280
For you, I wonder.

2372
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:46,780
Let's go.

2373
01:33:47,260 --> 01:33:50,580
Someday, our forces will clash in one final battle.

2374
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:53,880
They shall talk about this battle for years to come.

2375
01:33:54,180 --> 01:33:56,440
Where we fought in the Tau Tau Pond.

2376
01:33:56,800 --> 01:34:01,640
Where we fought... I can't believe it.

2377
01:34:02,100 --> 01:34:03,300
Their one weakness.

2378
01:34:05,420 --> 01:34:06,140
Wadi!

2379
01:34:06,140 --> 01:34:07,840
Who would have thought?

2380
01:34:08,240 --> 01:34:08,600
Wait.

2381
01:34:10,580 --> 01:34:11,300
No.

2382
01:34:11,780 --> 01:34:12,980
You're too far.

2383
01:34:15,540 --> 01:34:16,040
Wait.

2384
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:17,620
Let's go.

2385
01:34:17,740 --> 01:34:18,780
I'm gonna kill them.

2386
01:34:20,140 --> 01:34:21,760
Wait, how do I get over there?

2387
01:34:22,660 --> 01:34:23,940
Guys, how do I jump again?

2388
01:34:24,120 --> 01:34:24,360
Oh, there.

2389
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:25,780
Don't worry.

2390
01:34:27,820 --> 01:34:29,300
Let me kill these guys first.

2391
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:33,600
Alright, nice.

2392
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:36,580
Okay.

2393
01:34:37,680 --> 01:34:39,480
They're all just witches.

2394
01:34:42,120 --> 01:34:43,360
Alright, nice.

2395
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:46,440
Jesus, you're so tanky!

2396
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:48,820
That's the worst.

2397
01:34:49,300 --> 01:34:51,900
When you're so god damn tanky!

2398
01:34:56,740 --> 01:34:57,540
Okay, nice.

2399
01:35:00,460 --> 01:35:01,260
One more hit.

2400
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:02,560
Time to act.

2401
01:35:03,080 --> 01:35:04,800
The curtain cross here!

2402
01:35:05,180 --> 01:35:06,160
The enemy officer has been defeated.

2403
01:35:06,160 --> 01:35:06,800
Oh, what I thought.

2404
01:35:07,620 --> 01:35:08,580
Their one weakness.

2405
01:35:09,460 --> 01:35:09,860
Wait.

2406
01:35:10,020 --> 01:35:11,380
This should be like...

2407
01:35:11,380 --> 01:35:12,600
A successful...

2408
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:13,780
There we go.

2409
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:17,700
Alright, I'm gonna leave you guys there.

2410
01:35:19,820 --> 01:35:21,240
Wait, how do I jump out there?

2411
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:22,800
I keep forgetting how to jump.

2412
01:35:25,200 --> 01:35:26,220
Oh my god, guys.

2413
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:27,780
I don't know how to get back up there.

2414
01:35:29,160 --> 01:35:29,840
Okay, there you go.

2415
01:35:32,540 --> 01:35:33,960
Don't worry, I'm here, guys.

2416
01:35:34,140 --> 01:35:35,420
Oh my god.

2417
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:37,140
Oh my god, I could...

2418
01:35:37,140 --> 01:35:37,980
Oh wait, mounted charge.

2419
01:35:38,220 --> 01:35:39,520
Oh my god, this is a perfect mounted.

2420
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:40,320
Go in there!

2421
01:35:40,660 --> 01:35:42,580
My eight men are still alive!

2422
01:35:44,620 --> 01:35:46,000
Oh my god!

2423
01:35:46,460 --> 01:35:48,120
You guys did it!

2424
01:35:48,220 --> 01:35:49,620
I've always believed in you!

2425
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:51,880
My eight men are still alive!

2426
01:35:53,780 --> 01:35:56,100
They still have their legs!

2427
01:35:57,860 --> 01:35:59,260
We got one!

2428
01:36:01,200 --> 01:36:02,620
Fiction, thank you for the super chat.

2429
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:03,540
Thank you, thank you.

2430
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:05,620
Gears of War is officially moved.

2431
01:36:05,740 --> 01:36:06,260
Oh, really?

2432
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:07,340
Finally!

2433
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:08,160
Oh my god.

2434
01:36:08,740 --> 01:36:09,680
I'm actually surprised.

2435
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:11,440
Looks like we've got...

2436
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:13,200
Can't believe they finally actually are...

2437
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:15,260
Is it remastered or just like a port?

2438
01:36:15,860 --> 01:36:16,980
But thank you for the super chat.

2439
01:36:17,080 --> 01:36:17,720
Thank you, thank you.

2440
01:36:17,860 --> 01:36:19,580
That's one of the games I've always wanted to try.

2441
01:36:19,580 --> 01:36:22,260
Everything we do is supposedly impossible.

2442
01:36:24,180 --> 01:36:25,620
I'm just glad that...

2443
01:36:25,620 --> 01:36:26,820
Oh, poor...

2444
01:36:26,820 --> 01:36:28,240
That one guy fell off the cliff.

2445
01:36:28,940 --> 01:36:29,240
Indeed.

2446
01:36:29,940 --> 01:36:32,360
We all survive what many would not.

2447
01:36:32,620 --> 01:36:34,800
It serves as a strong reminder...

2448
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:37,080
That I possess such reliable companions.

2449
01:36:37,980 --> 01:36:38,960
Oh yeah, companions.

2450
01:36:39,660 --> 01:36:40,640
Yeah, it's...

2451
01:36:40,640 --> 01:36:42,180
The great battle of the...

2452
01:36:42,180 --> 01:36:43,660
Wayside Pond Water.

2453
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:44,560
Perfect!

2454
01:36:44,580 --> 01:36:45,640
And our great purpose.

2455
01:36:47,140 --> 01:36:51,640
It was truly a battle that people would tell for years to come.

2456
01:36:53,120 --> 01:36:54,700
Fispo, thank you for the super chat.

2457
01:36:54,820 --> 01:36:55,760
Thank you, thank you.

2458
01:36:56,720 --> 01:36:59,620
The hardest battle that Southall I ever fought.

2459
01:37:08,040 --> 01:37:08,560
Nice.

2460
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:09,460
Plus 28.

2461
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:11,240
I finally did it.

2462
01:37:11,420 --> 01:37:15,480
I've held onto that goddamn thing for so long.

2463
01:37:17,960 --> 01:37:18,800
Hit, hit.

2464
01:37:19,060 --> 01:37:20,440
Lead a successful charge.

2465
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:20,980
Is there any more?

2466
01:37:21,100 --> 01:37:21,760
Oh my god.

2467
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:23,100
I don't understand this one.

2468
01:37:23,320 --> 01:37:24,960
What is the wheel recovery?

2469
01:37:30,180 --> 01:37:31,380
Is that the counter?

2470
01:37:31,700 --> 01:37:32,380
For the wheels?

2471
01:37:32,620 --> 01:37:33,040
Or what?

2472
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:39,360
That was a narrow escape.

2473
01:37:39,900 --> 01:37:40,920
But we made it.

2474
01:37:41,580 --> 01:37:43,100
We were lucky everyone did their part.

2475
01:37:43,640 --> 01:37:47,480
I lost count of the times I thought that tidal wave of soldiers would swallow us whole.

2476
01:37:48,220 --> 01:37:53,780
So this is what it means to face the full brunt of Lord Tao Tao's forces in a direct conflict.

2477
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:55,640
So it seems.

2478
01:37:57,040 --> 01:37:58,260
Zhao Yun, Zhou Tsang.

2479
01:37:58,720 --> 01:38:00,140
We've already put so much weight on you.

2480
01:38:00,140 --> 01:38:00,220
I don't see.

2481
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:02,580
On the contrary.

2482
01:38:03,140 --> 01:38:06,380
Overcoming deadly circumstances is an officer's one true joy.

2483
01:38:06,760 --> 01:38:08,460
I'm thankful for the experience.

2484
01:38:09,640 --> 01:38:11,700
I'd go to hell and back for Lord Guan Yu.

2485
01:38:11,980 --> 01:38:14,780
As long as he's around, I can get through anything.

2486
01:38:15,620 --> 01:38:16,080
I see.

2487
01:38:16,720 --> 01:38:18,800
Okay, I know what wheel cover is now.

2488
01:38:18,900 --> 01:38:19,340
Thanks, guys.

2489
01:38:20,180 --> 01:38:22,580
We just need one more for the Pan Tong mission.

2490
01:38:28,620 --> 01:38:29,100
Whoops.

2491
01:38:33,730 --> 01:38:34,350
Okay.

2492
01:38:34,730 --> 01:38:35,170
Okay.

2493
01:38:35,170 --> 01:38:38,390
Escape the ever-tighten grip of Tao Tao forces into the hands of Lu Biao.

2494
01:38:38,750 --> 01:38:41,530
They went on to spend a brief period under his protection.

2495
01:38:42,250 --> 01:38:42,810
Okay.

2496
01:38:44,170 --> 01:38:45,110
County Castle.

2497
01:38:45,310 --> 01:38:46,330
Shinye County.

2498
01:38:56,160 --> 01:38:59,580
A brief period of eight years have passed.

2499
01:39:00,120 --> 01:39:01,060
Wouldn't you agree?

2500
01:39:04,120 --> 01:39:05,440
That does sound so bad.

2501
01:39:05,580 --> 01:39:07,260
Let's drink away our problems, guys.

2502
01:39:07,640 --> 01:39:09,040
It's great to have a break from fighting.

2503
01:39:09,260 --> 01:39:11,680
But my body is itching for some action.

2504
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:14,540
Forget it, Zhang Fei.

2505
01:39:15,320 --> 01:39:20,260
The last time you thought you had time to drink, you nearly destroyed Liu Biao's reputation.

2506
01:39:21,060 --> 01:39:22,460
He needs an intervention.

2507
01:39:22,980 --> 01:39:23,860
Come on, and I have boredom here.

2508
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:27,200
I figured Tao Tao would be hot on our heels.

2509
01:39:27,500 --> 01:39:29,700
But he ended up falling back toward Hebei.

2510
01:39:29,700 --> 01:39:32,080
This is an intervention right now.

2511
01:39:32,340 --> 01:39:33,060
And go out on patrol.

2512
01:39:34,100 --> 01:39:36,420
Lord Liu Biao has given us a warm welcome.

2513
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:40,460
And even allowed us to garrison here at Shinye Castle.

2514
01:39:40,980 --> 01:39:41,300
Alright.

2515
01:39:42,060 --> 01:39:42,900
I'm trying to get tissues.

2516
01:39:42,900 --> 01:39:49,380
I think it's best to meet Lord Liu Biao's expectations by governing well and earning the trust of the people of Shinye.

2517
01:39:49,980 --> 01:39:55,940
If you have time to get drunk, then you have time to listen to the troubles of at least one of the peasants.

2518
01:39:56,600 --> 01:39:58,360
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

2519
01:39:59,400 --> 01:40:02,860
But isn't that the sort of thing we've been doing since the start?

2520
01:40:04,360 --> 01:40:08,820
I thought Liu Bei brought us here to do something bigger and more important.

2521
01:40:09,580 --> 01:40:15,100
But while we're sitting around and doing our jobs, Tao Tao is getting stronger by the day.

2522
01:40:15,540 --> 01:40:20,180
It's because Tao Tao has like 10 strategists in his army.

2523
01:40:20,460 --> 01:40:22,240
We still have zero.

2524
01:40:24,040 --> 01:40:27,180
You gave me the role of strategist.

2525
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:35,460
Every time he has a meeting room, his entire meeting room is just people that think for him.

2526
01:40:35,460 --> 01:40:36,540
What's best for us?

2527
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,700
Also, Billy, thank you for the five gifted shits.

2528
01:40:40,020 --> 01:40:41,000
Thank you, thank you.

2529
01:40:44,260 --> 01:40:47,060
This strategy is for nerds, Doki.

2530
01:40:54,060 --> 01:40:56,160
We still haven't met him yet.

2531
01:40:56,460 --> 01:41:02,980
We've been losing, but somehow, for some reason, we still, we still haven't recruited a guy that thinks.

2532
01:41:03,560 --> 01:41:04,200
All right.

2533
01:41:04,740 --> 01:41:08,280
What kind of super chats do I have today from the ye olde dragoons?

2534
01:41:08,820 --> 01:41:11,100
To the one who saved our caravan once again.

2535
01:41:11,560 --> 01:41:12,180
Not Doki.

2536
01:41:12,460 --> 01:41:13,440
Thank you for the super chat.

2537
01:41:13,560 --> 01:41:13,780
Thank you.

2538
01:41:13,860 --> 01:41:14,880
Thank you, caravan leader.

2539
01:41:15,240 --> 01:41:17,820
Thank you for defending our caravan from those bandits.

2540
01:41:18,100 --> 01:41:22,480
You just started your journey as wandering warrior when you helped us.

2541
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:26,900
It has been a long time since I last saw you, but I'm relieved that you seem to be in good health.

2542
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:29,600
What's more, I've heard that you have remembered your past.

2543
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:34,220
And you still act with just as mishonor as you did before rediscovering yourself.

2544
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:39,300
You are the scared, sacred wings that will carry our world to the peace that awaits us.

2545
01:41:39,580 --> 01:41:45,300
I have no doubt that you will continue to bring hope to all who gaze up at the sky in search of salvation.

2546
01:41:45,680 --> 01:41:48,100
Please accept this modest gift as my thanks.

2547
01:41:48,300 --> 01:41:50,320
I eagerly await the day we meet again.

2548
01:41:50,460 --> 01:41:53,800
Oh my god, this guy gave me $10,000.

2549
01:41:54,760 --> 01:41:58,000
Oh my, thank you for the aka, aka, aka, super.

2550
01:41:58,540 --> 01:42:05,140
Oh my god, we have an oil Saudi prince right now in ye olde ancient China.

2551
01:42:08,780 --> 01:42:10,360
A former patient.

2552
01:42:10,660 --> 01:42:11,840
Thank you for the super chat.

2553
01:42:11,980 --> 01:42:12,940
Thank you, thank you.

2554
01:42:13,500 --> 01:42:14,720
Greetings, not Doki.

2555
01:42:15,080 --> 01:42:23,200
After the doctor helped you regain your memories and my body was stored to full health, I've been left with fewer reasons to visit him.

2556
01:42:23,620 --> 01:42:24,960
Life, oh my god, that's right.

2557
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:29,620
If you, like, make them, like, if you, like, don't fully cure them, they'll always have to depend on you.

2558
01:42:29,780 --> 01:42:31,980
And then you'll make so much money as a doctor.

2559
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:33,360
That is so smart.

2560
01:42:33,560 --> 01:42:35,180
That's very unethical too.

2561
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:41,440
Life is just so peaceful these days.

2562
01:42:41,640 --> 01:42:48,040
Since then, it seems Master Yuanha has been traveling the realm, helping countless people in need.

2563
01:42:48,240 --> 01:42:51,620
I'm now worried that he may be working a bit too hard.

2564
01:42:51,620 --> 01:42:55,880
And, uh, and worrying is the only thing I can do about it.

2565
01:42:56,100 --> 01:42:58,240
If only he had someone to help him.

2566
01:42:58,400 --> 01:42:59,480
An assistant, perhaps.

2567
01:43:00,020 --> 01:43:02,560
Uh, no, I think an apprentice is what he needs.

2568
01:43:02,720 --> 01:43:06,540
I suppose it wouldn't be feasible to ask someone as busy as yourself, would it?

2569
01:43:06,700 --> 01:43:08,220
This will be my last letter.

2570
01:43:08,360 --> 01:43:10,800
But I leave the doctor's well-being in your hands.

2571
01:43:10,920 --> 01:43:11,900
Oh my god.

2572
01:43:12,120 --> 01:43:13,000
You fool!

2573
01:43:13,380 --> 01:43:14,000
You fool!

2574
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:15,520
You could have not fully...

2575
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:16,960
Oh my god, he gave me 50 rocks.

2576
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:17,500
Never mind.

2577
01:43:17,720 --> 01:43:18,300
That's fine.

2578
01:43:18,700 --> 01:43:19,680
I got 50 rocks.

2579
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:20,180
I'm okay.

2580
01:43:24,940 --> 01:43:25,660
That's fine.

2581
01:43:29,020 --> 01:43:30,660
I need that 50 rocks.

2582
01:43:32,120 --> 01:43:34,100
Uh, Fat Cat, thank you for the super chat.

2583
01:43:34,220 --> 01:43:34,860
Thank you, thank you.

2584
01:43:34,980 --> 01:43:37,440
10 strategists versus 1 Guan Yun.

2585
01:43:38,220 --> 01:43:40,240
Needs more strategists.

2586
01:43:41,060 --> 01:43:42,440
Thank you for the super chat.

2587
01:43:42,580 --> 01:43:43,500
Thank you, thank you.

2588
01:43:43,640 --> 01:43:45,120
Okay, what does Xiao Yun want?

2589
01:43:48,740 --> 01:43:50,080
Uh, Lazy Squid.

2590
01:43:50,280 --> 01:43:51,060
Luke the Lazy Squid.

2591
01:43:51,220 --> 01:43:52,360
Welcome to the tomato farm.

2592
01:43:52,500 --> 01:43:53,140
Welcome, welcome.

2593
01:43:55,780 --> 01:43:59,080
Tonight, Lord Liu Biao is hosting a banquet in Xiangyan.

2594
01:43:59,820 --> 01:44:03,360
Lord Liu Bei will be attending, and I've been ordered to accompany him as his escort.

2595
01:44:05,020 --> 01:44:06,460
I'll need to be ready for anything.

2596
01:44:08,620 --> 01:44:09,640
Anything on your mind?

2597
01:44:09,780 --> 01:44:09,940
Yeah.

2598
01:44:10,120 --> 01:44:11,140
Why am I talking to you?

2599
01:44:11,260 --> 01:44:11,800
I'm just spending a little time here in Jing.

2600
01:44:12,260 --> 01:44:13,740
I've come to understand something.

2601
01:44:14,360 --> 01:44:17,660
Those who serve under Lord Liu Biao have divided into factions.

2602
01:44:18,300 --> 01:44:20,320
And one of them doesn't think very well of them.

2603
01:44:20,520 --> 01:44:21,000
Traitors!

2604
01:44:23,660 --> 01:44:26,820
Initially, Lord Liu Bei had hoped to attend the banquet on his own.

2605
01:44:27,340 --> 01:44:31,500
He said that having an intimidating escort would make us look un- And he chose you?

2606
01:44:32,160 --> 01:44:33,220
Ha ha ha ha!

2607
01:44:34,060 --> 01:44:38,680
You're more of a fucking pretty boy than intimidating escort.

2608
01:44:41,220 --> 01:44:41,820
Why not?

2609
01:44:41,940 --> 01:44:42,880
Yeah, why not?

2610
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:43,880
Why not me?

2611
01:44:44,300 --> 01:44:45,340
Ha ha ha!

2612
01:44:45,720 --> 01:44:47,020
I'm so intimidating!

2613
01:44:47,720 --> 01:44:48,760
Why not me?

2614
01:44:49,420 --> 01:44:50,040
Ha ha ha ha!

2615
01:44:51,180 --> 01:44:53,560
Well, at first you planned on having the both of us as escort.

2616
01:44:53,640 --> 01:44:54,640
And he picked you!

2617
01:44:55,580 --> 01:44:57,840
I thought I had something special!

2618
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,840
Lord Liu Biao wouldn't be able to relax enough to enjoy his wine.

2619
01:45:02,080 --> 01:45:03,300
Oh, we'd be too hot.

2620
01:45:03,500 --> 01:45:04,000
I get it.

2621
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,980
I want you to rest, so you can be ready for anything unexpected.

2622
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:10,120
As for me, I am bound by our leader's orders.

2623
01:45:10,300 --> 01:45:10,540
It's okay.

2624
01:45:10,760 --> 01:45:12,960
I'd be too distracted if we're both there.

2625
01:45:13,200 --> 01:45:14,060
It's just to be too hot.

2626
01:45:14,480 --> 01:45:17,500
After what I've seen, it's clear that not all is well here in the land of Jing.

2627
01:45:18,300 --> 01:45:20,320
All I can do is hope for the best.

2628
01:45:26,840 --> 01:45:29,680
The following day, fade to black.

2629
01:45:34,440 --> 01:45:35,180
Wake up!

2630
01:45:35,580 --> 01:45:36,300
Liu Bei's in trouble!

2631
01:45:36,300 --> 01:45:36,560
What?

2632
01:45:38,540 --> 01:45:40,560
Wait, I'm trying to sleep!

2633
01:45:42,980 --> 01:45:45,040
Wake me up in five minutes, guys.

2634
01:45:45,260 --> 01:45:46,700
Five more minutes, John Fee!

2635
01:45:46,700 --> 01:45:48,920
Stop running and get out of bed right now!

2636
01:45:50,980 --> 01:45:51,760
My brother!

2637
01:45:52,180 --> 01:45:53,600
My brother, he...

2638
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:55,480
He's at the banquet, he...

2639
01:45:55,480 --> 01:45:57,100
Dammit, I can't explain it!

2640
01:45:57,940 --> 01:45:58,460
What happened?

2641
01:45:58,540 --> 01:45:59,840
Zhao Yun will tell you everything!

2642
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:01,920
Just hurry up and come with me!

2643
01:46:02,220 --> 01:46:02,680
What happened?

2644
01:46:02,820 --> 01:46:04,880
Wait, why is Zhao Yun back?

2645
01:46:10,810 --> 01:46:12,150
Oh, thank you for the super chat.

2646
01:46:12,250 --> 01:46:12,970
Thank you, thank you.

2647
01:46:13,030 --> 01:46:13,970
He's a pretty boy.

2648
01:46:13,970 --> 01:46:15,810
He's a different kind of this.

2649
01:46:16,110 --> 01:46:16,130
He's a different kind of this.

2650
01:46:16,130 --> 01:46:16,990
He hasn't returned here to Xinyi.

2651
01:46:18,370 --> 01:46:20,130
Where could he possibly have gone?

2652
01:46:20,410 --> 01:46:20,750
What?

2653
01:46:21,970 --> 01:46:24,570
Just to reiterate what you told us, Zhao Yun.

2654
01:46:25,710 --> 01:46:27,850
You had one job!

2655
01:46:28,650 --> 01:46:28,710
Correct?

2656
01:46:29,650 --> 01:46:30,090
Yes.

2657
01:46:30,590 --> 01:46:37,430
One of Lord Liu Biao's retainers, Tsai Mao, made the suggestion to divide the banquet with the lords and the retainers seated separately.

2658
01:46:38,810 --> 01:46:39,830
And you agreed?

2659
01:46:40,450 --> 01:46:41,910
I just did the proposal over and over again.

2660
01:46:42,230 --> 01:46:46,190
But I relented at Lord Liu Biao's command and was forced to go to a separate room.

2661
01:46:46,370 --> 01:46:46,690
Oh, okay.

2662
01:46:46,810 --> 01:46:47,830
At least you'd, like, try.

2663
01:46:48,130 --> 01:46:52,590
Lord Liu Biao came later to inform me that Lord Liu Biao had gone to relieve himself and never returned.

2664
01:46:52,870 --> 01:46:53,190
Oh my god!

2665
01:46:53,250 --> 01:46:54,510
What if he fell in the toilet?

2666
01:46:54,810 --> 01:46:55,450
The whole banquet was in an uproar.

2667
01:46:55,450 --> 01:46:58,790
And that is when I became wise to Tsai Mao's plan.

2668
01:46:59,570 --> 01:47:01,870
You were supposed to go to the bathroom with him!

2669
01:47:03,370 --> 01:47:06,050
And saw the banquet as a chance to eliminate Lord Liu Biao.

2670
01:47:06,970 --> 01:47:12,790
Getting the lords and retainers into separate rooms was likely a ploy to pull Lord Liu Biao out from under my watch.

2671
01:47:13,810 --> 01:47:14,910
Such treachery.

2672
01:47:15,470 --> 01:47:19,390
But it is possible that our brother sensed danger and fled.

2673
01:47:21,150 --> 01:47:25,370
You were supposed to guide him to the bathroom and help him hold him!

2674
01:47:25,450 --> 01:47:25,790
No!

2675
01:47:26,150 --> 01:47:26,250
No!

2676
01:47:27,610 --> 01:47:29,290
I hope he's safe!

2677
01:47:30,270 --> 01:47:31,470
He'll pay for this.

2678
01:47:31,710 --> 01:47:33,710
I'll kill him the second I see him!

2679
01:47:34,930 --> 01:47:36,210
Calm yourself, Zhang Fei.

2680
01:47:36,810 --> 01:47:39,910
For now, we need to make sure our brother is safe.

2681
01:47:40,690 --> 01:47:41,370
Damn it all!

2682
01:47:41,790 --> 01:47:43,130
And what about Liu Biao?

2683
01:47:43,350 --> 01:47:45,670
We all know he must have had a hand in this, too.

2684
01:47:47,890 --> 01:47:48,370
No.

2685
01:47:48,790 --> 01:47:52,330
Lord Liu Biao rebuked Tsai Mao and placed him under strict watch.

2686
01:47:52,550 --> 01:47:55,270
It really seemed like he had no prior knowledge of the plot.

2687
01:47:55,270 --> 01:47:55,790
Whatsoever.

2688
01:47:56,010 --> 01:47:56,730
Oh my god.

2689
01:47:57,090 --> 01:47:59,070
He is not at fault for what happened.

2690
01:48:00,030 --> 01:48:02,310
We had training for this, Jaliyu.

2691
01:48:02,630 --> 01:48:04,870
You should fall on the one who failed to guard his lordship.

2692
01:48:05,010 --> 01:48:05,510
That's right!

2693
01:48:05,790 --> 01:48:07,850
You shamelessly returned with nothing but excuses.

2694
01:48:08,150 --> 01:48:08,970
Whip yourself!

2695
01:48:09,470 --> 01:48:09,590
Now!

2696
01:48:10,330 --> 01:48:10,810
I will fight for Liu Biao.

2697
01:48:10,930 --> 01:48:12,430
Even if it costs me my life.

2698
01:48:12,430 --> 01:48:13,170
Punish yourself!

2699
01:48:13,430 --> 01:48:16,750
And after that, I intend to accept whatever punishment I deserve.

2700
01:48:18,030 --> 01:48:19,230
I think you're right.

2701
01:48:19,630 --> 01:48:21,570
All we have gone is faithfully guard our brother's life.

2702
01:48:22,010 --> 01:48:24,030
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

2703
01:48:25,030 --> 01:48:25,650
Lord Guan Yu.

2704
01:48:27,010 --> 01:48:30,370
While we're wasting time talking, our brother could be...

2705
01:48:30,370 --> 01:48:30,910
Right.

2706
01:48:31,730 --> 01:48:33,250
We've no time to waste.

2707
01:48:33,810 --> 01:48:36,210
The more of us we have looking for him, the better.

2708
01:48:36,930 --> 01:48:37,470
Joe Tao.

2709
01:48:37,670 --> 01:48:38,930
Send your man to Xi'an now.

2710
01:48:38,930 --> 01:48:39,250
What the fuck?

2711
01:48:39,370 --> 01:48:40,430
Why did we bring the intern?

2712
01:48:42,650 --> 01:48:45,310
Why is the intern here in this very important meeting?

2713
01:48:59,290 --> 01:49:00,030
Don't worry.

2714
01:49:00,270 --> 01:49:01,430
I'll get the job done.

2715
01:49:02,050 --> 01:49:03,990
He's got a cool hat.

2716
01:49:08,690 --> 01:49:09,250
Alright.

2717
01:49:09,750 --> 01:49:10,490
I knew it.

2718
01:49:10,570 --> 01:49:11,890
He should have picked me.

2719
01:49:11,890 --> 01:49:12,170
Yeah.

2720
01:49:12,650 --> 01:49:13,250
See, look at that.

2721
01:49:13,350 --> 01:49:15,230
Zao, you can't get anything right.

2722
01:49:15,670 --> 01:49:18,310
He should have picked me for the job.

2723
01:49:19,330 --> 01:49:19,990
There's like...

2724
01:49:19,990 --> 01:49:22,070
There's a city man that wants to talk to me.

2725
01:49:22,650 --> 01:49:23,070
Okay.

2726
01:49:23,370 --> 01:49:24,050
What's this?

2727
01:49:25,190 --> 01:49:27,390
Why does a city man want to talk to me?

2728
01:49:30,290 --> 01:49:31,250
Where is he?

2729
01:49:32,410 --> 01:49:34,150
Am I going to the right area?

2730
01:49:35,790 --> 01:49:36,850
Oh, I am not.

2731
01:49:37,550 --> 01:49:39,310
God, this map is a little confusing.

2732
01:49:41,890 --> 01:49:42,970
Lord Sun Tren will make a great war.

2733
01:49:42,970 --> 01:49:44,350
It should be like...

2734
01:49:44,350 --> 01:49:44,490
Here?

2735
01:49:47,070 --> 01:49:47,470
Weeeeee.

2736
01:49:50,850 --> 01:49:51,650
And then...

2737
01:49:52,110 --> 01:49:53,110
Okay, it's this way.

2738
01:49:53,850 --> 01:49:54,390
And then we...

2739
01:49:54,390 --> 01:49:54,950
Oh, there they are.

2740
01:49:55,050 --> 01:49:55,950
I see the city man.

2741
01:49:58,450 --> 01:49:58,850
Weeeeee.

2742
01:49:58,930 --> 01:49:59,670
Alright, city man.

2743
01:49:59,810 --> 01:50:00,310
What do you want?

2744
01:50:01,310 --> 01:50:02,590
Have we seen...

2745
01:50:02,590 --> 01:50:02,770
Yeah.

2746
01:50:03,650 --> 01:50:04,370
Have you seen him?

2747
01:50:05,450 --> 01:50:05,930
Uh...

2748
01:50:05,930 --> 01:50:06,650
What?

2749
01:50:07,170 --> 01:50:07,650
What?

2750
01:50:07,790 --> 01:50:09,550
Who was that again?

2751
01:50:09,930 --> 01:50:10,090
What?

2752
01:50:10,790 --> 01:50:14,530
I did not almost die in several battles for you to go who for Lu Bay.

2753
01:50:14,830 --> 01:50:15,790
Hey, come on now.

2754
01:50:16,130 --> 01:50:18,450
He was Lord Liu Biao's guest of honor.

2755
01:50:18,670 --> 01:50:18,850
Remember?

2756
01:50:20,250 --> 01:50:21,010
Hey, no.

2757
01:50:21,130 --> 01:50:23,230
Did they just say who to Lu Bay?

2758
01:50:23,330 --> 01:50:25,070
Oh, so he's pretty important, huh?

2759
01:50:26,850 --> 01:50:29,550
I don't know what Lord Liu Bay looks like, but...

2760
01:50:29,550 --> 01:50:32,470
I did see an elegantly dressed man over at the...

2761
01:50:32,470 --> 01:50:33,310
I can't believe it.

2762
01:50:33,390 --> 01:50:34,590
He got who mega lulled.

2763
01:50:35,050 --> 01:50:40,650
We usually go to the market up north, but there's a nasty bunch of soldiers hanging around there, so...

2764
01:50:40,650 --> 01:50:40,950
We went south and...

2765
01:50:40,950 --> 01:50:43,710
You don't even have a name and you don't know who Lu Bay is?

2766
01:50:43,890 --> 01:50:44,710
I think that must have been when he spotted him.

2767
01:50:46,350 --> 01:50:48,690
I'm sorry we couldn't be of any more help.

2768
01:50:49,390 --> 01:50:51,910
I hope someone finds Lord Liu Bay soon.

2769
01:50:53,670 --> 01:50:54,150
Alright.

2770
01:50:55,070 --> 01:50:56,390
Do you know what's going on?

2771
01:50:57,350 --> 01:50:59,670
I've been running around asking everyone I can.

2772
01:50:59,990 --> 01:51:02,830
But not a single one of these people have seen Lord Liu Bay.

2773
01:51:02,930 --> 01:51:03,870
Oh, that's not good.

2774
01:51:04,510 --> 01:51:06,310
I'm going to look around here a little more.

2775
01:51:06,570 --> 01:51:08,610
So, would you mind taking your search up north?

2776
01:51:09,290 --> 01:51:11,030
Everyone knows who City Madness is.

2777
01:51:11,150 --> 01:51:12,710
Every city has one of them.

2778
01:51:15,190 --> 01:51:17,870
So, your search brought you here as well.

2779
01:51:18,270 --> 01:51:19,630
That means my brother must have come this way.

2780
01:51:19,630 --> 01:51:20,670
At least one of them.

2781
01:51:20,930 --> 01:51:22,850
But there's a deep valley just ahead.

2782
01:51:22,850 --> 01:51:25,790
And I heard someone just cut the bridge down.

2783
01:51:26,670 --> 01:51:28,450
So, there's no way across.

2784
01:51:28,770 --> 01:51:29,870
I mean, I see the bridge right there.

2785
01:51:30,270 --> 01:51:33,190
You think that means he had to jump into the river down below?

2786
01:51:33,750 --> 01:51:37,550
And if he did, I really hope he made it across.

2787
01:51:38,810 --> 01:51:39,710
This bridge?

2788
01:51:40,190 --> 01:51:41,750
The one I just crossed?

2789
01:51:42,970 --> 01:51:43,450
Like...

2790
01:51:44,710 --> 01:51:45,470
That one?

2791
01:51:47,130 --> 01:51:48,630
He's like, they cut the bridge.

2792
01:51:48,850 --> 01:51:50,390
You mean that bridge?

2793
01:51:52,470 --> 01:51:54,310
Oh, City Mad wants to talk again.

2794
01:51:54,410 --> 01:51:56,550
But I want to know if there's anybody important back here.

2795
01:51:56,550 --> 01:51:59,290
Being hungry keeps you in low spirits.

2796
01:52:00,330 --> 01:52:02,550
Alright, is there...

2797
01:52:02,550 --> 01:52:03,810
Any, uh...

2798
01:52:03,810 --> 01:52:04,230
It's you.

2799
01:52:04,450 --> 01:52:05,290
Any interactions?

2800
01:52:06,110 --> 01:52:07,030
Oh, again?

2801
01:52:07,910 --> 01:52:08,470
Okay.

2802
01:52:09,170 --> 01:52:10,750
Oh, I could give him money.

2803
01:52:11,250 --> 01:52:11,710
No.

2804
01:52:12,990 --> 01:52:14,250
No, I...

2805
01:52:14,250 --> 01:52:15,710
No, we're not...

2806
01:52:15,710 --> 01:52:17,710
No, we're not giving the intern money.

2807
01:52:17,730 --> 01:52:18,950
He does this for free.

2808
01:52:19,270 --> 01:52:21,370
Like, we're not letting him have...

2809
01:52:21,370 --> 01:52:21,710
No.

2810
01:52:26,370 --> 01:52:29,210
No, the intern is not...

2811
01:52:29,210 --> 01:52:29,290
No.

2812
01:52:32,130 --> 01:52:34,090
Okay, there's the city man again.

2813
01:52:34,590 --> 01:52:36,630
Wait, there's a second city man?

2814
01:52:37,470 --> 01:52:39,150
There's more than one?

2815
01:52:42,670 --> 01:52:44,570
In the city?

2816
01:53:00,910 --> 01:53:04,250
I don't think he's a child.

2817
01:53:09,370 --> 01:53:13,590
Sir, I think your child...

2818
01:53:13,590 --> 01:53:17,710
I might have just gone through puberty.

2819
01:53:17,710 --> 01:53:19,310
Oh, my...

2820
01:53:19,310 --> 01:53:20,790
Bro, that's...

2821
01:53:20,790 --> 01:53:22,510
I think...

2822
01:53:22,510 --> 01:53:23,150
I think...

2823
01:53:23,910 --> 01:53:24,790
I don't know.

2824
01:53:25,090 --> 01:53:27,070
There could be several possibilities.

2825
01:53:27,930 --> 01:53:28,890
This guy...

2826
01:53:28,890 --> 01:53:30,810
This guy is a little person...

2827
01:53:30,810 --> 01:53:32,470
And has scammed the city man.

2828
01:53:32,690 --> 01:53:34,810
It's like the orphan situation...

2829
01:53:34,810 --> 01:53:38,310
Where he's, like, actually some, like, 40-year-old man...

2830
01:53:38,310 --> 01:53:40,770
Who just, like, looks like a child...

2831
01:53:40,770 --> 01:53:42,370
And they adopted him...

2832
01:53:44,210 --> 01:53:45,170
And now...

2833
01:53:45,170 --> 01:53:47,250
And now he's trying to steal his wife.

2834
01:53:48,250 --> 01:53:48,730
I...

2835
01:53:48,730 --> 01:53:49,890
Oh, all right.

2836
01:53:50,510 --> 01:53:52,810
Shall we head downstream to the east today?

2837
01:53:52,870 --> 01:53:54,370
Oh, Tabby, thank you for the raid.

2838
01:53:54,530 --> 01:53:55,430
Thank you, thank you.

2839
01:53:55,630 --> 01:53:57,170
Water flows much faster up west.

2840
01:53:58,690 --> 01:53:59,830
Please excuse us.

2841
01:54:00,010 --> 01:54:00,810
We'll be going now.

2842
01:54:02,610 --> 01:54:04,410
I want to talk to your child.

2843
01:54:05,170 --> 01:54:07,090
Let me talk to your child.

2844
01:54:07,330 --> 01:54:09,930
Why does your child only have one line?

2845
01:54:09,930 --> 01:54:10,930
Let me...

2846
01:54:10,930 --> 01:54:14,430
Let me interrogate the child.

2847
01:54:14,730 --> 01:54:17,190
Let me hear what he has to say.

2848
01:54:18,910 --> 01:54:21,170
The quote-unquote child.

2849
01:54:41,670 --> 01:54:43,270
Wait, what?

2850
01:54:46,610 --> 01:54:48,050
He just...

2851
01:54:48,050 --> 01:54:51,430
Bro, we sent our entire army to find you.

2852
01:54:53,590 --> 01:54:54,610
Found him.

2853
01:54:56,850 --> 01:54:58,250
What did you do?

2854
01:55:02,830 --> 01:55:04,230
Sup, that's me.

2855
01:55:07,630 --> 01:55:08,390
Excuse me?

2856
01:55:08,550 --> 01:55:09,170
No, explain.

2857
01:55:09,690 --> 01:55:14,310
No, we're not just gonna travel five days to a new city.

2858
01:55:15,070 --> 01:55:17,290
Like, explore and then we fade to black.

2859
01:55:17,490 --> 01:55:17,990
They're just like...

2860
01:55:17,990 --> 01:55:21,150
I'm not gonna say anything of why I was gone for several days now.

2861
01:55:21,990 --> 01:55:24,630
But I'll say everything when I'm back home.

2862
01:55:24,630 --> 01:55:26,750
I didn't realize what Sai Mao was up to during the banquet.

2863
01:55:27,250 --> 01:55:30,310
I pretended to go relieve myself and made my escape.

2864
01:55:31,170 --> 01:55:34,730
I was not familiar with the area, so all I could do was wander.

2865
01:55:35,730 --> 01:55:39,890
Before I knew it, the night had grown dark and I was lost in the mountains.

2866
01:55:40,530 --> 01:55:41,850
Just when I began to...

2867
01:55:41,850 --> 01:55:42,430
Oh my god.

2868
01:55:43,110 --> 01:55:43,970
He met...

2869
01:55:43,970 --> 01:55:45,450
He met my Oshi, guys.

2870
01:55:45,830 --> 01:55:47,830
It was home to an old man named Si Ma Hui.

2871
01:55:49,830 --> 01:55:51,350
I told him who I was.

2872
01:55:51,590 --> 01:55:54,890
Oh my god, we finally can have someone to thank for us.

2873
01:55:55,210 --> 01:55:55,250
Si Ma Hui?

2874
01:55:55,750 --> 01:55:58,050
Why does that name sound so familiar?

2875
01:55:58,990 --> 01:56:01,770
Apparently, everyone calls him Master Shui Jing.

2876
01:56:02,470 --> 01:56:06,890
He is not in the service of Lord Liu Biao, and he lives in seclusion.

2877
01:56:07,590 --> 01:56:12,310
When I told him about my current circumstances, he gave me this advice.

2878
01:56:13,290 --> 01:56:17,810
Choose one of my pupils, the sleeping dragon or the fledgling fiend.

2879
01:56:17,830 --> 01:56:20,010
Phoenix, and your path will become clear.

2880
01:56:20,850 --> 01:56:21,890
Sleeping dragon?

2881
01:56:22,970 --> 01:56:23,970
Fledgling fiend?

2882
01:56:24,290 --> 01:56:25,370
Who the hell are they?

2883
01:56:25,610 --> 01:56:26,930
That's Pantong and Zhukotlin.

2884
01:56:27,130 --> 01:56:28,810
You've met many people in your travels.

2885
01:56:29,390 --> 01:56:31,930
Do you have any idea who those two might be?

2886
01:56:32,610 --> 01:56:33,510
Or both?

2887
01:56:34,370 --> 01:56:34,990
Okay, one.

2888
01:56:35,330 --> 01:56:37,390
No one comes to my mind.

2889
01:56:37,630 --> 01:56:38,850
We're getting my Oshi.

2890
01:56:40,330 --> 01:56:40,850
Zhukotlin.

2891
01:56:41,490 --> 01:56:44,790
So, you think he's either the sleeping dragon or the fleshly fiend?

2892
01:56:44,790 --> 01:56:45,830
That's right, I'm sorry, Pantong.

2893
01:56:45,830 --> 01:56:46,230
Phoenix.

2894
01:56:46,970 --> 01:56:48,650
With all due respect, Lord Liu Biao.

2895
01:56:48,690 --> 01:56:50,090
You're just gonna die anyway.

2896
01:56:50,590 --> 01:56:53,330
For the names of the sleeping dragon and fledgling phoenix.

2897
01:56:53,770 --> 01:56:55,490
Yeah, honestly, yeah, that's true.

2898
01:56:55,730 --> 01:56:57,730
That would really speed things along for us.

2899
01:56:57,810 --> 01:56:59,510
You were gone for like several days.

2900
01:57:00,030 --> 01:57:01,690
I did all I could to get the names out of him.

2901
01:57:02,350 --> 01:57:03,030
You'll know.

2902
01:57:03,430 --> 01:57:07,290
He would just say, you'll know, and smile without answering.

2903
01:57:08,270 --> 01:57:08,510
Hmm.

2904
01:57:10,010 --> 01:57:13,810
Perhaps he meant that you must put forth some effort to find what you seek.

2905
01:57:15,610 --> 01:57:16,870
And then we get both.

2906
01:57:17,630 --> 01:57:21,330
And even then, we can't save Lupe.

2907
01:57:22,070 --> 01:57:24,290
He's just like, you know, he's like one of those guys.

2908
01:57:24,930 --> 01:57:27,810
He has like all these like amazing generals and strategists.

2909
01:57:27,810 --> 01:57:29,430
And they're all like, I can fix him.

2910
01:57:29,690 --> 01:57:31,730
But in the end, he was just unfixable.

2911
01:57:32,410 --> 01:57:34,170
It was just that sad.

2912
01:57:40,530 --> 01:57:42,730
Everyone just kept saying, I can fix him.

2913
01:57:42,890 --> 01:57:45,390
And then in the end, like, it just was not fixable.

2914
01:57:56,830 --> 01:57:59,570
He had to prove he couldn't be fixed.

2915
01:57:59,570 --> 01:58:05,970
And the first step is to make his son just not mentally there.

2916
01:58:06,710 --> 01:58:11,310
And by dropping his son on the floor on his head.

2917
01:58:12,850 --> 01:58:17,550
Just to make sure that his bloodline ends there.

2918
01:58:26,520 --> 01:58:27,800
What's this all about?

2919
01:58:28,620 --> 01:58:29,480
I'm sorry.

2920
01:58:30,180 --> 01:58:32,200
I guess I should start from the beginning.

2921
01:58:33,280 --> 01:58:36,340
What Lord Lupe's ranks are missing is the guidance of wisdom.

2922
01:58:37,460 --> 01:58:39,800
I myself have spent a good deal of time in the...

2923
01:58:39,800 --> 01:58:40,520
John Madden.

2924
01:58:41,280 --> 01:58:45,020
Well, I may not have the vision of the sleeping dragon or...

2925
01:58:45,020 --> 01:58:46,360
And then like...

2926
01:58:46,360 --> 01:58:47,840
Jukotlan had to like...

2927
01:58:47,840 --> 01:58:50,180
Take care of the special son.

2928
01:58:51,340 --> 01:58:52,760
I feel so bad.

2929
01:58:55,640 --> 01:58:57,940
Yeah, after Lupe died...

2930
01:58:57,940 --> 01:58:59,540
He had to take care of him.

2931
01:59:01,060 --> 01:59:02,240
Where do I start?

2932
01:59:05,830 --> 01:59:07,590
South-South forces are attacking.

2933
01:59:07,890 --> 01:59:09,210
Make haste to the war room.

2934
01:59:09,390 --> 01:59:09,850
Right away.

2935
01:59:19,050 --> 01:59:22,070
South-South forces have already reached the castle gates.

2936
01:59:23,750 --> 01:59:25,310
And they've moved into such a...

2937
01:59:25,310 --> 01:59:26,690
They always are attacking me.

2938
01:59:27,750 --> 01:59:28,850
It's like...

2939
01:59:28,850 --> 01:59:30,410
South-South is like the...

2940
01:59:30,410 --> 01:59:31,290
The...

2941
01:59:31,290 --> 01:59:32,450
Like hand sanitizer.

2942
01:59:32,610 --> 01:59:33,410
That was like...

2943
01:59:33,410 --> 01:59:35,470
It kills 99% of the bacteria.

2944
01:59:36,150 --> 01:59:38,150
And Lupe is like always like...

2945
01:59:38,150 --> 01:59:40,470
But like he always survives the 1%.

2946
01:59:40,470 --> 01:59:43,190
But there might be even more of them coming.

2947
01:59:43,870 --> 01:59:46,570
If we stay on the defensive too long...

2948
01:59:46,570 --> 01:59:48,450
Our soldiers will lose heart.

2949
01:59:48,590 --> 01:59:49,330
The weekly event.

2950
01:59:49,910 --> 01:59:50,210
You're right.

2951
01:59:51,230 --> 01:59:55,130
More importantly, us holding up here would be a great burden on the people of Xinyu.

2952
01:59:56,010 --> 01:59:57,470
But what else can be done?

2953
01:59:58,390 --> 02:00:00,530
We aren't getting anywhere by talking.

2954
02:00:01,270 --> 02:00:02,530
I'm going out there.

2955
02:00:02,730 --> 02:00:03,170
All right?

2956
02:00:21,030 --> 02:00:28,250
We'll be right back.

2957
02:00:31,610 --> 02:00:34,250
Can you know this, nerd?

2958
02:00:35,950 --> 02:00:37,350
Would you be willing to help us through this?

2959
02:00:38,090 --> 02:00:38,850
What is your name?

2960
02:00:39,650 --> 02:00:42,510
I am Shishu, a pupil of Master Shui Jing.

2961
02:00:42,810 --> 02:00:46,410
I thought my skills would be best put to use in the service of Lord Liu Bei.

2962
02:00:46,910 --> 02:00:47,750
So, here I am.

2963
02:00:48,310 --> 02:00:50,310
Our first brain cells...

2964
02:00:51,390 --> 02:00:51,870
Wait!

2965
02:00:52,850 --> 02:00:55,470
His master didn't even mention him?!

2966
02:00:56,050 --> 02:00:58,070
That is so sad!

2967
02:00:58,950 --> 02:01:02,510
I had a look at the enemy's formation in the front of the gate just a moment ago.

2968
02:01:03,030 --> 02:01:05,350
It is known as the Eight Gates Formation.

2969
02:01:06,450 --> 02:01:11,070
Charging into that powerful formation without the right strategy would end in certain death.

2970
02:01:11,250 --> 02:01:14,270
That's our always... that's our strategy the entire time.

2971
02:01:15,070 --> 02:01:16,910
We've always done that and we live.

2972
02:01:18,350 --> 02:01:24,610
But if I could observe their ranks from a closer position, I may be able to tell you the best way to fight against them.

2973
02:01:25,490 --> 02:01:26,950
Brother, what should we do?

2974
02:01:27,670 --> 02:01:30,470
Can we really trust this strategist with our lives?

2975
02:01:30,590 --> 02:01:32,590
Are we really letting this nerd here?

2976
02:01:33,190 --> 02:01:33,790
I believe in him.

2977
02:01:36,030 --> 02:01:38,550
Besides, none of us had any idea how to get out of this.

2978
02:01:39,010 --> 02:01:41,030
So why not give Shishu's plan a chance?

2979
02:01:42,130 --> 02:01:45,570
Lord Liu Bei, you will not be disappointed.

2980
02:01:48,470 --> 02:01:50,070
The forgotten one.

2981
02:01:50,310 --> 02:01:50,470
Oh!

2982
02:01:50,910 --> 02:01:52,090
That poor guy!

2983
02:01:52,770 --> 02:01:54,030
That poor guy!

2984
02:01:54,310 --> 02:01:55,670
No one mentioned him!

2985
02:01:56,490 --> 02:01:59,850
His master did not talk about this guy!

2986
02:02:01,030 --> 02:02:01,330
Dragon?

2987
02:02:01,910 --> 02:02:03,290
Liu Bei and his sworn brothers...

2988
02:02:03,290 --> 02:02:05,310
Alright, I'm gonna use the bathroom real quick, guys.

2989
02:02:05,350 --> 02:02:05,890
I'll be right back.

2990
02:02:05,890 --> 02:02:07,890
I can't wait to meet them.

2991
02:02:08,510 --> 02:02:10,090
Well, we won't have to wait long.

2992
02:02:10,490 --> 02:02:11,290
They'll be here today.

2993
02:04:45,740 --> 02:04:46,640
Sorry, I'm back.

2994
02:04:46,640 --> 02:04:48,780
I have to refill my water as well.

2995
02:04:49,520 --> 02:04:49,740
Woah!

2996
02:04:50,200 --> 02:04:51,720
Thank you guys for the super chats.

2997
02:04:52,840 --> 02:04:53,320
Uh...

2998
02:04:53,320 --> 02:04:59,460
Alan, Johnny, Solid, Mike, Bite, Zekra, Potipo, Duck, Mehdi, Smug, Anton and Kaz.

2999
02:04:59,460 --> 02:05:00,820
Thank you for the super chat.

3000
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:01,160
Thank you.

3001
02:05:01,340 --> 02:05:01,880
Thank you.

3002
02:05:02,280 --> 02:05:03,560
Really appreciate it, guys.

3003
02:05:03,740 --> 02:05:04,260
Thank you!

3004
02:05:05,080 --> 02:05:06,300
Alright, let's do this.

3005
02:05:08,500 --> 02:05:09,020
Let's...

3006
02:05:09,020 --> 02:05:10,460
Let's fight the...

3007
02:05:10,460 --> 02:05:13,300
Let's fight the hand sanitizer once more.

3008
02:05:17,520 --> 02:05:20,960
We finally have the one strategist in the strategy room.

3009
02:05:22,020 --> 02:05:25,180
I've not yet earned this place among you, but please hear me out.

3010
02:05:26,500 --> 02:05:28,420
What am I looking at?

3011
02:05:30,240 --> 02:05:30,580
What...

3012
02:05:30,580 --> 02:05:33,120
What the fuck is this?

3013
02:05:33,340 --> 02:05:34,760
What am I looking at?

3014
02:05:38,100 --> 02:05:39,800
What the fuck?

3015
02:05:40,480 --> 02:05:40,820
Okay.

3016
02:05:43,240 --> 02:05:44,860
That's a lot of people.

3017
02:05:47,240 --> 02:05:48,580
As you can see.

3018
02:05:49,460 --> 02:05:52,220
Tao Tao's forces, I've closed in Xing Yi.

3019
02:05:52,820 --> 02:05:54,640
In exceptional formation.

3020
02:05:55,080 --> 02:05:58,280
They're led by Xiao Hu Yun, and I'm sure you're all well aware.

3021
02:05:58,280 --> 02:05:59,940
He is one of Tao Tao's...

3022
02:05:59,940 --> 02:06:01,700
Yeah, it's like a big...

3023
02:06:01,700 --> 02:06:05,480
It's like the white blood cell ready to fucking kill me.

3024
02:06:06,140 --> 02:06:07,900
I'm like the virus and the white...

3025
02:06:07,900 --> 02:06:10,580
That's like the white blood cell that's about to fucking eat me.

3026
02:06:11,520 --> 02:06:12,000
Um...

3027
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:13,760
He is one of Tao Tao's top officers.

3028
02:06:14,400 --> 02:06:15,080
That's where I sat.

3029
02:06:15,220 --> 02:06:17,060
We're commanded by Lord Lu Bei.

3030
02:06:17,300 --> 02:06:19,760
He is the formation on which our forces stand.

3031
02:06:19,920 --> 02:06:21,480
Without him, we will all be lost.

3032
02:06:21,480 --> 02:06:22,420
No.

3033
02:06:22,420 --> 02:06:22,780
Okay.

3034
02:06:25,540 --> 02:06:26,180
Okay.

3035
02:06:26,340 --> 02:06:28,800
The other thought came into my mind.

3036
02:06:29,300 --> 02:06:30,440
That's the egg.

3037
02:06:33,240 --> 02:06:35,520
And I'm gonna be the first one in it.

3038
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:35,960
I...

3039
02:06:38,760 --> 02:06:41,520
I appreciate the kind words.

3040
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:45,160
But we can't afford to lose you either.

3041
02:06:45,860 --> 02:06:46,000
True.

3042
02:06:46,300 --> 02:06:46,720
Thank you.

3043
02:06:47,200 --> 02:06:48,360
It is true.

3044
02:06:48,840 --> 02:06:52,320
That I am the only one who knows how to break this formation.

3045
02:06:52,940 --> 02:06:53,860
Lord Lu Bu...

3046
02:06:53,860 --> 02:06:56,100
I'm gonna win the race, guys.

3047
02:06:57,260 --> 02:06:58,920
I'm grateful for your concern.

3048
02:07:01,200 --> 02:07:03,980
Now, let us discuss the formation we're dealing with.

3049
02:07:04,180 --> 02:07:07,020
It's a unique strategy called the Eight Gates Formation.

3050
02:07:08,180 --> 02:07:10,360
It's said that none who attack it survive.

3051
02:07:10,360 --> 02:07:15,060
But if we're careful to take the right steps, we should be able to breathe through and go straight in.

3052
02:07:17,200 --> 02:07:24,680
However, the Eight Gates Formation being employed by Tao Tao's forces in this battle looks slightly different from the one that I know.

3053
02:07:24,900 --> 02:07:30,520
To break the formation, we'll have to distinguish the gates of life, view, and opening from the others.

3054
02:07:30,820 --> 02:07:32,580
The first thing I do...

3055
02:07:32,960 --> 02:07:36,900
I need you all to do is capture the high ground so I can get a better look at the formation.

3056
02:07:37,240 --> 02:07:40,400
From there, I'll find an entry point for our troops to break through.

3057
02:07:40,980 --> 02:07:45,760
Until then, everyone must be very careful not to engage with the Eight...

3058
02:07:45,760 --> 02:07:46,620
No!

3059
02:07:47,260 --> 02:07:49,020
But I must be first!

3060
02:07:50,840 --> 02:07:52,980
You attack it with the wrong strategy.

3061
02:07:53,220 --> 02:07:55,720
The formation will overwhelm your troops.

3062
02:07:56,580 --> 02:07:59,880
Resulting in heavy losses for our side.

3063
02:08:01,200 --> 02:08:02,700
Hmm, I think that's all I have to say for now.

3064
02:08:02,900 --> 02:08:05,910
I'll have more orders for everyone as soon as I know about the situation.

3065
02:08:06,740 --> 02:08:12,720
Without you here, we probably would have blindly charged into the so-called Eight Gates Formation.

3066
02:08:13,940 --> 02:08:15,060
No, he's right.

3067
02:08:15,300 --> 02:08:15,920
He's right.

3068
02:08:16,100 --> 02:08:18,680
No, we would have 100% just went in there.

3069
02:08:18,680 --> 02:08:19,280
That's...

3070
02:08:19,280 --> 02:08:24,100
That's been our strategy for the last 10 playthroughs of this...

3071
02:08:24,100 --> 02:08:24,900
Of this game.

3072
02:08:27,420 --> 02:08:30,420
In this battle, we will rely on Shu Shu's...

3073
02:08:30,420 --> 02:08:31,860
On our strategist wisdom.

3074
02:08:32,520 --> 02:08:35,040
Everyone, do as you're told and fight with all your strength.

3075
02:08:35,220 --> 02:08:36,320
I like how...

3076
02:08:36,320 --> 02:08:39,560
If we succeed, he did all of that and history forgets him.

3077
02:08:39,560 --> 02:08:42,860
And then all we talk about is Pantong and Zhukotlen.

3078
02:08:44,120 --> 02:08:44,720
Alright.

3079
02:08:45,540 --> 02:08:47,360
What happens if I charge right in?

3080
02:08:47,640 --> 02:08:48,440
Will I lose?

3081
02:08:53,500 --> 02:08:57,500
Do you think I'd lose if I did not listen?

3082
02:09:00,260 --> 02:09:01,200
I'm gonna do it.

3083
02:09:02,240 --> 02:09:03,200
I'm gonna do it.

3084
02:09:03,360 --> 02:09:03,620
I'm gonna do it, guys.

3085
02:09:03,820 --> 02:09:04,480
No one's gonna...

3086
02:09:04,480 --> 02:09:05,640
No one can stop me.

3087
02:09:06,400 --> 02:09:06,840
Let's...

3088
02:09:06,840 --> 02:09:08,460
Let me beat them up first.

3089
02:09:08,700 --> 02:09:10,620
Wait, actually, let me check what I need to do.

3090
02:09:11,820 --> 02:09:12,260
Alright.

3091
02:09:12,280 --> 02:09:13,500
We need to...

3092
02:09:13,500 --> 02:09:15,600
We have 50 more for this.

3093
02:09:15,780 --> 02:09:16,680
And then...

3094
02:09:16,680 --> 02:09:17,800
Okay, we'll do the wheel later.

3095
02:09:19,980 --> 02:09:20,740
Alright, nice.

3096
02:09:23,760 --> 02:09:24,760
I'm gonna do it.

3097
02:09:24,820 --> 02:09:26,360
I'm gonna break that formation.

3098
02:09:28,720 --> 02:09:32,980
I don't need a strategist to tell me what to do.

3099
02:09:34,440 --> 02:09:36,100
It has always worked.

3100
02:09:39,540 --> 02:09:41,280
It has always worked.

3101
02:09:41,920 --> 02:09:44,860
Why would it suddenly stop working?

3102
02:09:48,920 --> 02:09:52,720
Oh, he's gonna go straight in it.

3103
02:09:52,900 --> 02:09:53,940
Wait, he is gonna go in it.

3104
02:09:54,060 --> 02:09:54,740
Wait, I will...

3105
02:09:54,740 --> 02:09:56,180
No, he's trying to be there first!

3106
02:10:06,680 --> 02:10:08,000
Wait, that's not fair!

3107
02:10:08,240 --> 02:10:09,060
They're trying to...

3108
02:10:09,060 --> 02:10:11,040
They're trying to break through the egg!

3109
02:10:11,040 --> 02:10:11,120
Okay!

3110
02:10:14,140 --> 02:10:17,620
What the fuck?!

3111
02:10:17,620 --> 02:10:18,520
What the...

3112
02:10:18,520 --> 02:10:19,040
What the...

3113
02:10:19,040 --> 02:10:20,620
We can't go anywhere!

3114
02:10:21,900 --> 02:10:23,520
They surrounded us so quickly.

3115
02:10:24,560 --> 02:10:26,760
So this is the infamous eight gates formation.

3116
02:10:27,060 --> 02:10:27,780
Wait, that's the eight gate?

3117
02:10:28,400 --> 02:10:28,900
Nice.

3118
02:10:29,060 --> 02:10:30,120
I still have a chance.

3119
02:10:32,100 --> 02:10:33,380
I still...

3120
02:10:34,320 --> 02:10:35,180
Nice, guys.

3121
02:10:35,640 --> 02:10:36,440
There's still hope!

3122
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:38,320
I'll break the formation.

3123
02:10:38,600 --> 02:10:39,080
Don't worry.

3124
02:10:39,700 --> 02:10:41,440
I'll be the one to break it.

3125
02:10:41,900 --> 02:10:42,420
Don't worry.

3126
02:10:42,420 --> 02:10:43,440
They fell for the trap.

3127
02:10:43,820 --> 02:10:45,280
Now, well, that's what they get.

3128
02:10:45,380 --> 02:10:47,080
We're charging in without a plan.

3129
02:10:48,440 --> 02:10:49,220
Don't worry.

3130
02:10:49,220 --> 02:10:50,320
There's no time to spare.

3131
02:10:50,320 --> 02:10:51,940
I'll be the one to break it, guys.

3132
02:10:52,220 --> 02:10:52,760
Let's take the high ground.

3133
02:10:53,120 --> 02:10:53,520
Let's take the high ground.

3134
02:10:53,520 --> 02:10:54,220
Quickly invested.

3135
02:10:54,580 --> 02:10:56,440
They died trying to be first.

3136
02:10:57,980 --> 02:10:58,700
Okay.

3137
02:11:03,020 --> 02:11:03,740
Okay.

3138
02:11:08,400 --> 02:11:08,680
Okay.

3139
02:11:09,520 --> 02:11:10,240
Nice.

3140
02:11:10,780 --> 02:11:11,420
MINE!

3141
02:11:12,020 --> 02:11:13,440
Has been defeated.

3142
02:11:13,600 --> 02:11:14,460
Where should we go next?

3143
02:11:15,320 --> 02:11:15,860
It's time!

3144
02:11:16,400 --> 02:11:17,340
It's my turn!

3145
02:11:18,180 --> 02:11:20,020
Can I save this?

3146
02:11:20,280 --> 02:11:24,340
Okay, good- It's time!

3147
02:11:26,180 --> 02:11:27,560
It's my turn!

3148
02:11:30,080 --> 02:11:31,320
It's time!

3149
02:11:32,580 --> 02:11:35,340
Nothing bad's gonna happen to me!

3150
02:11:36,440 --> 02:11:37,740
Wait a minute.

3151
02:11:38,520 --> 02:11:39,840
Wait a minute.

3152
02:11:41,360 --> 02:11:43,020
I'll just kill him first.

3153
02:11:45,280 --> 02:11:48,300
Wait, I actually can't do anything.

3154
02:11:48,900 --> 02:11:50,760
It has like a shield.

3155
02:11:51,080 --> 02:11:53,220
I can't even break it.

3156
02:11:53,720 --> 02:11:54,260
Wait, that's...

3157
02:11:54,260 --> 02:11:54,560
Fuck!

3158
02:11:56,720 --> 02:11:58,920
Wait, I can't even break it!

3159
02:12:00,160 --> 02:12:00,780
It's fine.

3160
02:12:00,780 --> 02:12:02,240
I'll kill you because I'm angry.

3161
02:12:03,240 --> 02:12:04,180
Daddy's angry.

3162
02:12:05,800 --> 02:12:07,040
It's a little peek.

3163
02:12:07,220 --> 02:12:08,840
I just want to know what's going on.

3164
02:12:09,400 --> 02:12:16,660
Can I like... Eventually.

3165
02:12:17,220 --> 02:12:18,420
What if I do this?

3166
02:12:19,180 --> 02:12:21,440
Oh my god, I'll force my... Kwan Yun!

3167
02:12:21,980 --> 02:12:23,120
Make the opening!

3168
02:12:23,120 --> 02:12:28,140
I can't... I actually can't get through.

3169
02:12:28,440 --> 02:12:30,020
That's not fair!

3170
02:12:30,640 --> 02:12:33,160
I want him to be first!

3171
02:12:34,060 --> 02:12:34,200
No!

3172
02:12:35,620 --> 02:12:38,180
It's... They were safe!

3173
02:12:38,880 --> 02:12:39,980
They... No!

3174
02:12:40,440 --> 02:12:41,620
There's protection!

3175
02:12:52,040 --> 02:12:54,840
I can't believe it!

3176
02:12:54,960 --> 02:12:56,320
They're cheating!

3177
02:12:56,780 --> 02:12:56,820
No!

3178
02:12:59,980 --> 02:13:03,020
The protection was too strong.

3179
02:13:03,400 --> 02:13:05,340
I can't believe it!

3180
02:13:07,880 --> 02:13:09,160
It's okay.

3181
02:13:09,580 --> 02:13:11,080
They can be broken.

3182
02:13:11,620 --> 02:13:13,040
Why did I just say that?

3183
02:13:13,740 --> 02:13:14,220
I'm sorry.

3184
02:13:14,800 --> 02:13:15,040
Sorry.

3185
02:13:15,100 --> 02:13:16,300
I'm a little too wild today.

3186
02:13:16,440 --> 02:13:16,960
Let's get serious!

3187
02:13:17,680 --> 02:13:20,580
Oh, word.

3188
02:13:20,740 --> 02:13:21,780
They're so...

3189
02:13:22,580 --> 02:13:22,980
How...

3190
02:13:28,020 --> 02:13:28,940
Alright, nice.

3191
02:13:30,960 --> 02:13:32,420
I can't believe this.

3192
02:13:32,540 --> 02:13:32,540
Alright.

3193
02:13:32,540 --> 02:13:34,520
The enemy officer has been defeated.

3194
02:13:38,320 --> 02:13:39,540
Wait, where's the other guy?

3195
02:13:39,660 --> 02:13:40,240
Oh, there he is.

3196
02:13:40,280 --> 02:13:42,540
I was like, Oh my god, that's the other Daoyun.

3197
02:13:43,920 --> 02:13:45,860
That's... Oh wait, his name is Daoyun.

3198
02:13:46,460 --> 02:13:47,140
Oh my god.

3199
02:13:47,480 --> 02:13:48,600
Just one letter.

3200
02:13:50,580 --> 02:13:51,060
Alright.

3201
02:13:51,660 --> 02:13:52,240
Let's get to this.

3202
02:13:52,340 --> 02:13:52,820
That's fine.

3203
02:13:54,500 --> 02:13:55,320
Take this.

3204
02:13:55,560 --> 02:13:56,000
Boom.

3205
02:13:57,280 --> 02:13:58,240
And then...

3206
02:13:58,240 --> 02:14:00,300
Oh my god, he just kissed me.

3207
02:14:03,420 --> 02:14:04,440
Legally distinct.

3208
02:14:05,080 --> 02:14:06,580
We've done everything that you asked.

3209
02:14:06,820 --> 02:14:07,400
Alright, what do we do?

3210
02:14:09,060 --> 02:14:11,240
Now, we need to observe their formation.

3211
02:14:11,580 --> 02:14:13,200
Alright, we just stay up here?

3212
02:14:15,820 --> 02:14:16,900
He's just...

3213
02:14:16,900 --> 02:14:20,080
As I expected, their formation is incomplete.

3214
02:14:20,520 --> 02:14:20,660
Yeah?

3215
02:14:20,660 --> 02:14:25,060
If everyone follows my orders correctly, this plan is sure to succeed.

3216
02:14:27,940 --> 02:14:28,520
But...

3217
02:14:28,520 --> 02:14:30,080
The enemy is undeniably strong.

3218
02:14:30,080 --> 02:14:31,220
Wait, it's like a maze.

3219
02:14:31,480 --> 02:14:32,840
They made a fucking maze?

3220
02:14:33,140 --> 02:14:33,780
Just move!

3221
02:14:33,780 --> 02:14:34,780
To exploit.

3222
02:14:35,700 --> 02:14:39,940
The gates of life, view, and opening have been expertly concealed.

3223
02:14:40,320 --> 02:14:43,340
It will be difficult to determine which one to attack.

3224
02:14:46,320 --> 02:14:46,840
Hmm.

3225
02:14:48,020 --> 02:14:50,520
If we choose the wrong one, it will not end well for us.

3226
02:14:50,520 --> 02:14:50,680
Blue.

3227
02:14:53,260 --> 02:14:55,240
Oh my god, we're playing blues.

3228
02:14:55,840 --> 02:15:00,120
Those three gates are bound to be different from the others, somehow.

3229
02:15:00,920 --> 02:15:03,220
We just need to look for that difference.

3230
02:15:03,780 --> 02:15:07,700
If we choose the correct gate, their formation will crumble.

3231
02:15:09,380 --> 02:15:09,920
Okay.

3232
02:15:10,880 --> 02:15:11,600
How do we do it?

3233
02:15:11,760 --> 02:15:12,960
Then we now know what must be done.

3234
02:15:13,880 --> 02:15:16,440
Thanks to Shishu, we have a clue.

3235
02:15:16,920 --> 02:15:17,240
Alright.

3236
02:15:17,700 --> 02:15:19,000
We gotta follow the maze.

3237
02:15:19,480 --> 02:15:21,120
At close the formation, look for a gate that is different from the others.

3238
02:15:21,660 --> 02:15:23,880
Look for a gate that's... like that one?

3239
02:15:26,080 --> 02:15:29,600
When you've spotted the difference, enter the formation from there.

3240
02:15:29,760 --> 02:15:29,860
Enter the formation from there.

3241
02:15:30,300 --> 02:15:32,240
You will be able to dismantle it from inside.

3242
02:15:32,240 --> 02:15:35,220
Like, like this giant gate in front of me?

3243
02:15:35,380 --> 02:15:35,940
Like...

3244
02:15:37,020 --> 02:15:38,100
The enemy's movement.

3245
02:15:38,920 --> 02:15:40,680
We must have entered the wrong gate.

3246
02:15:40,940 --> 02:15:40,960
Oh.

3247
02:15:41,160 --> 02:15:42,340
Oh, that wasn't it.

3248
02:15:42,600 --> 02:15:43,660
You have entered the gate of destruction.

3249
02:15:43,660 --> 02:15:44,000
Oh no!

3250
02:15:44,340 --> 02:15:44,900
Oh no!

3251
02:15:45,040 --> 02:15:46,160
I entered the wrong gate!

3252
02:15:46,400 --> 02:15:46,480
No!

3253
02:15:47,520 --> 02:15:49,380
I thought I was being clever!

3254
02:15:53,240 --> 02:15:53,800
No!

3255
02:15:55,440 --> 02:15:57,040
I was like, look at that gate!

3256
02:15:57,220 --> 02:15:58,340
It looks different, guys!

3257
02:15:58,840 --> 02:16:00,680
Oh my god, they're so stupid.

3258
02:16:01,080 --> 02:16:03,920
I was like, haha, they're so stupid.

3259
02:16:04,280 --> 02:16:06,380
Look how stupid this gate is.

3260
02:16:07,100 --> 02:16:07,720
It looks...

3261
02:16:07,720 --> 02:16:08,320
Look at that!

3262
02:16:08,580 --> 02:16:10,300
I can't believe it!

3263
02:16:10,980 --> 02:16:12,300
I was a fool!

3264
02:16:14,140 --> 02:16:16,280
I thought I was so smart!

3265
02:16:16,280 --> 02:16:16,380
What?

3266
02:16:19,440 --> 02:16:20,040
Guan Yu!

3267
02:16:20,180 --> 02:16:21,380
Get over here!

3268
02:16:24,040 --> 02:16:24,800
Wrong hole.

3269
02:16:26,480 --> 02:16:27,440
Wrong hole.

3270
02:16:30,200 --> 02:16:31,220
Mono Guan Yu, please.

3271
02:16:31,360 --> 02:16:32,180
I need you here.

3272
02:16:32,800 --> 02:16:33,840
Oh my god.

3273
02:16:34,480 --> 02:16:35,060
Oh my...

3274
02:16:35,060 --> 02:16:35,480
Get over here.

3275
02:16:35,640 --> 02:16:36,040
Get over here.

3276
02:16:36,200 --> 02:16:38,440
You dragoons, you might die, but...

3277
02:16:38,700 --> 02:16:39,340
God damn.

3278
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:42,020
Oh, that was close.

3279
02:16:47,910 --> 02:16:48,670
Okay, nice.

3280
02:16:50,850 --> 02:16:51,650
Okay, nice.

3281
02:16:52,610 --> 02:16:53,370
Okay, nice.

3282
02:16:56,670 --> 02:16:57,070
Alright.

3283
02:16:57,530 --> 02:16:59,170
Oh, there's a fire arrow.

3284
02:16:59,430 --> 02:17:00,530
Don't worry, I saved you!

3285
02:17:04,890 --> 02:17:07,230
So like, okay, only three of you guys died.

3286
02:17:11,990 --> 02:17:12,790
Okay, come on.

3287
02:17:12,910 --> 02:17:13,470
Just one more.

3288
02:17:15,670 --> 02:17:17,050
I do in love.

3289
02:17:17,230 --> 02:17:17,750
Oh no!

3290
02:17:18,070 --> 02:17:18,350
Oh no!

3291
02:17:19,410 --> 02:17:20,030
Nice.

3292
02:17:21,270 --> 02:17:23,570
The enemy officer has been defeated.

3293
02:17:24,010 --> 02:17:24,870
Looking rough.

3294
02:17:25,270 --> 02:17:27,070
I shall retreat and fight another day.

3295
02:17:27,250 --> 02:17:30,270
Okay, so I entered the wrong hole, guys.

3296
02:17:30,730 --> 02:17:31,730
How do I...

3297
02:17:32,290 --> 02:17:34,350
Until another flaw appears in the formation.

3298
02:17:34,450 --> 02:17:35,590
Okay, I messed up.

3299
02:17:35,930 --> 02:17:37,910
Do you dare challenge this formation with your strength?

3300
02:17:37,910 --> 02:17:38,890
Oh, I messed up.

3301
02:17:39,510 --> 02:17:40,150
I...

3302
02:17:41,850 --> 02:17:45,570
What would have been like if I didn't mess up the hole?

3303
02:17:46,110 --> 02:17:46,650
What...

3304
02:17:50,250 --> 02:17:54,230
I wonder what would have been like if I found the right one.

3305
02:17:54,970 --> 02:17:55,450
I...

3306
02:17:58,810 --> 02:18:00,790
Oh, that's unfortunate.

3307
02:18:01,210 --> 02:18:03,290
So the enemy had units ready to attack.

3308
02:18:03,450 --> 02:18:06,350
The hate cage formation was to be used for a counter-attack.

3309
02:18:06,930 --> 02:18:07,770
Just as I predicted.

3310
02:18:08,570 --> 02:18:12,150
We should be able to stop the reinforcements at the Western Stronghold.

3311
02:18:13,530 --> 02:18:16,110
Not a moment to lose in dealing with the formation.

3312
02:18:17,490 --> 02:18:19,210
I'm trying to figure this out.

3313
02:18:19,310 --> 02:18:20,130
Kuan Yin, please!

3314
02:18:20,590 --> 02:18:22,110
Why aren't you helping?!

3315
02:18:23,590 --> 02:18:24,570
He's just...

3316
02:18:25,210 --> 02:18:26,970
He's just watching!

3317
02:18:31,710 --> 02:18:32,770
That, this is it.

3318
02:18:32,850 --> 02:18:33,310
I'm done.

3319
02:18:36,210 --> 02:18:37,010
I'm done.

3320
02:18:38,950 --> 02:18:39,770
That's it.

3321
02:18:41,090 --> 02:18:41,930
That's it.

3322
02:18:45,830 --> 02:18:47,050
I don't care.

3323
02:18:54,980 --> 02:18:55,580
What?!

3324
02:18:55,580 --> 02:18:55,740
What?!

3325
02:18:57,500 --> 02:18:58,680
Oh my god!

3326
02:19:00,320 --> 02:19:03,680
What do you mean I've lost my entire army?!

3327
02:19:03,680 --> 02:19:05,560
It was one hit!

3328
02:19:05,880 --> 02:19:08,080
How did you all die?!

3329
02:19:08,080 --> 02:19:09,120
Easy.

3330
02:19:10,040 --> 02:19:10,240
G.

3331
02:19:10,660 --> 02:19:10,740
G.

3332
02:19:11,340 --> 02:19:11,940
G.

3333
02:19:12,680 --> 02:19:12,920
G.

3334
02:19:13,600 --> 02:19:14,200
G.

3335
02:19:14,200 --> 02:19:14,300
G.

3336
02:19:14,640 --> 02:19:15,240
G.

3337
02:19:15,640 --> 02:19:16,380
Oh my god!

3338
02:19:16,560 --> 02:19:17,340
You guys all died!

3339
02:19:17,980 --> 02:19:18,660
Oh my god!

3340
02:19:18,860 --> 02:19:20,000
I don't understand!

3341
02:19:20,040 --> 02:19:21,640
How did you guys all die?!

3342
02:19:28,380 --> 02:19:31,280
The stupid 8 gate formation!

3343
02:19:33,960 --> 02:19:34,820
I don't know!

3344
02:19:34,960 --> 02:19:36,840
Why don't you help out and hit him!

3345
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:37,400
Guan Yin!

3346
02:19:38,480 --> 02:19:39,040
What?!

3347
02:19:39,620 --> 02:19:41,320
He's like, are you okay?

3348
02:19:42,280 --> 02:19:43,920
I don't know you can help!

3349
02:19:57,320 --> 02:19:58,660
I can use the...

3350
02:19:58,660 --> 02:20:00,760
I can finally use my hands!

3351
02:20:01,780 --> 02:20:03,600
Okay, how many more do I have to kill?

3352
02:20:03,900 --> 02:20:05,160
The stupid objective.

3353
02:20:06,820 --> 02:20:07,260
Uh...

3354
02:20:07,260 --> 02:20:08,080
Oh my god, I'm at 90.

3355
02:20:08,600 --> 02:20:09,800
Wait, I'm almost there, actually.

3356
02:20:13,920 --> 02:20:15,300
To break their formation!

3357
02:20:15,600 --> 02:20:18,920
Oh my god, when will I ever break their stupid formation?!

3358
02:20:19,900 --> 02:20:21,040
There you go!

3359
02:20:21,280 --> 02:20:23,400
Did it break the formation?!

3360
02:20:23,400 --> 02:20:24,340
Has been defeated.

3361
02:20:24,580 --> 02:20:27,200
I can't believe you broke through with the force alone!

3362
02:20:27,560 --> 02:20:29,100
Oh my god, I did it!

3363
02:20:29,300 --> 02:20:30,620
Brute force!

3364
02:20:33,220 --> 02:20:34,880
I did it, guys!

3365
02:20:36,160 --> 02:20:38,160
From sheer brute force!

3366
02:20:38,580 --> 02:20:40,020
I told you!

3367
02:20:40,600 --> 02:20:42,120
That's all we needed!

3368
02:20:50,520 --> 02:20:51,080
Shit!

3369
02:20:52,760 --> 02:20:54,640
Alright, let's kill this guy real quick!

3370
02:20:55,420 --> 02:20:57,300
I'm gonna go kill this guy real quick!

3371
02:20:57,460 --> 02:20:59,180
She won the...

3372
02:20:59,180 --> 02:21:00,320
It's the sixth gate!

3373
02:21:00,520 --> 02:21:02,340
Oh my god, I told you!

3374
02:21:02,560 --> 02:21:03,980
I told you!

3375
02:21:04,140 --> 02:21:06,420
We can do it from brute force!

3376
02:21:06,700 --> 02:21:07,820
We didn't need...

3377
02:21:07,820 --> 02:21:09,780
We didn't need it, actually!

3378
02:21:09,780 --> 02:21:11,160
I would be honored!

3379
02:21:11,700 --> 02:21:13,280
If I could test my skills!

3380
02:21:13,600 --> 02:21:14,780
Wait, I couldn't...

3381
02:21:15,740 --> 02:21:16,840
Wait, give me a sec!

3382
02:21:17,080 --> 02:21:19,040
We can have the perfect mounted charge!

3383
02:21:21,140 --> 02:21:23,140
Oh no, we already messed up the mounted charge!

3384
02:21:23,260 --> 02:21:23,780
It's okay!

3385
02:21:24,320 --> 02:21:25,020
It's fine!

3386
02:21:25,560 --> 02:21:25,940
It's fine!

3387
02:21:37,540 --> 02:21:38,500
It's fine!

3388
02:21:38,500 --> 02:21:39,940
You know what?

3389
02:21:40,400 --> 02:21:41,400
Ah, fuck it!

3390
02:21:41,600 --> 02:21:41,980
I...

3391
02:21:41,980 --> 02:21:42,780
Can't be bothered!

3392
02:21:44,500 --> 02:21:46,120
I gave up trying!

3393
02:21:51,860 --> 02:21:52,900
Fuck it!

3394
02:21:53,980 --> 02:21:55,360
This is just easier!

3395
02:22:00,300 --> 02:22:01,580
Get over here!

3396
02:22:01,580 --> 02:22:04,520
The god of war is coming for you!

3397
02:22:05,260 --> 02:22:08,140
This might be overkill, but I don't care!

3398
02:22:10,360 --> 02:22:11,860
I don't care!

3399
02:22:12,120 --> 02:22:13,480
Get out of here!

3400
02:22:15,680 --> 02:22:18,280
I'll keep swinging until you're dead!

3401
02:22:23,220 --> 02:22:24,300
That's red!

3402
02:22:26,260 --> 02:22:28,420
And now I shall swing!

3403
02:22:32,800 --> 02:22:33,560
Nice!

3404
02:22:34,920 --> 02:22:35,800
I did it!

3405
02:22:36,520 --> 02:22:37,020
Oofy!

3406
02:22:38,080 --> 02:22:38,740
Alright, nice!

3407
02:22:38,820 --> 02:22:40,000
We actually needed bread, too!

3408
02:22:42,320 --> 02:22:43,080
Alright!

3409
02:22:43,080 --> 02:22:44,120
Let's go!

3410
02:22:44,500 --> 02:22:45,800
Okay, we gotta find the gate!

3411
02:22:46,120 --> 02:22:48,720
Cause I clearly messed up the first time!

3412
02:22:49,380 --> 02:22:50,260
Mr. Broken Bond!

3413
02:22:50,360 --> 02:22:51,180
Thank you for the super chat!

3414
02:22:51,300 --> 02:22:52,000
Thank you, thank you!

3415
02:22:52,080 --> 02:22:54,560
Tookie, you went into the wrong hole!

3416
02:22:55,320 --> 02:22:55,960
Amateur!

3417
02:22:56,400 --> 02:22:57,240
Alright, guys!

3418
02:22:57,600 --> 02:23:00,080
Let's find the right hole now!

3419
02:23:00,960 --> 02:23:04,500
Which gate looks different from the other gates?

3420
02:23:06,460 --> 02:23:09,420
There's gate over here...

3421
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:11,080
And then there's...

3422
02:23:13,300 --> 02:23:15,340
There's no gate here!

3423
02:23:15,880 --> 02:23:16,740
Oh my god!

3424
02:23:16,920 --> 02:23:17,840
Which gate is it?

3425
02:23:18,080 --> 02:23:18,300
Wait!

3426
02:23:18,400 --> 02:23:19,600
There's no gate here!

3427
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:21,120
How do I...

3428
02:23:22,420 --> 02:23:23,060
Oh!

3429
02:23:24,800 --> 02:23:25,920
I still don't understand!

3430
02:23:26,720 --> 02:23:27,160
I...

3431
02:23:31,210 --> 02:23:31,850
Wait...

3432
02:23:31,850 --> 02:23:33,930
I still don't understand yet!

3433
02:23:34,590 --> 02:23:35,530
Oh my god!

3434
02:23:35,610 --> 02:23:36,930
I finished this stupid mission!

3435
02:23:37,110 --> 02:23:37,270
Okay!

3436
02:23:38,790 --> 02:23:39,430
Alright!

3437
02:23:40,150 --> 02:23:41,490
Let me get the...

3438
02:23:41,490 --> 02:23:42,050
Wait, actually?

3439
02:23:42,270 --> 02:23:43,170
Which is the strongest?

3440
02:23:44,450 --> 02:23:45,370
How do I sort?

3441
02:23:46,770 --> 02:23:47,290
Sort...

3442
02:23:48,450 --> 02:23:49,130
Oh wait!

3443
02:23:49,230 --> 02:23:49,890
This is the strongest!

3444
02:23:49,990 --> 02:23:51,010
I should use the strongest one!

3445
02:23:51,930 --> 02:23:53,090
Sorry, drag wounds!

3446
02:23:53,470 --> 02:23:54,430
Wait, actually...

3447
02:23:54,430 --> 02:23:55,090
Let me...

3448
02:23:55,090 --> 02:23:56,450
Change the...

3449
02:23:57,990 --> 02:23:59,490
Let me change it first!

3450
02:24:02,290 --> 02:24:03,150
I didn't know!

3451
02:24:03,370 --> 02:24:04,490
Oh, that's cool!

3452
02:24:05,790 --> 02:24:07,690
I'm only doing that because it looks cool!

3453
02:24:08,170 --> 02:24:09,830
Okay, then we'll do that and then...

3454
02:24:12,550 --> 02:24:13,930
And then we'll bring peace!

3455
02:24:14,470 --> 02:24:15,330
Oh my god!

3456
02:24:15,490 --> 02:24:15,630
Yes!

3457
02:24:15,730 --> 02:24:16,590
The peace bringer!

3458
02:24:19,750 --> 02:24:20,190
Alright!

3459
02:24:22,550 --> 02:24:23,250
Alright, nice!

3460
02:24:26,190 --> 02:24:27,110
Get out of here!

3461
02:24:27,110 --> 02:24:27,250
There!

3462
02:24:28,110 --> 02:24:30,650
It looks cool and that's all that matters!

3463
02:24:31,310 --> 02:24:31,910
That's all that matters!

3464
02:24:32,550 --> 02:24:33,070
Alright!

3465
02:24:33,910 --> 02:24:35,150
Let's use our e...

3466
02:24:35,150 --> 02:24:35,810
Our eye!

3467
02:24:36,570 --> 02:24:36,970
Gah!

3468
02:24:40,310 --> 02:24:41,290
Where do we go?

3469
02:24:43,190 --> 02:24:45,590
Wait, how does my eagle eye tell me where to go?

3470
02:24:47,150 --> 02:24:47,830
I...

3471
02:24:47,830 --> 02:24:48,450
I...

3472
02:24:48,450 --> 02:24:49,090
I don't understand!

3473
02:24:49,830 --> 02:24:50,250
I...

3474
02:24:52,810 --> 02:24:53,490
I...

3475
02:24:54,450 --> 02:24:55,870
Everyone was like...

3476
02:24:55,870 --> 02:24:56,990
Just use your...

3477
02:24:57,590 --> 02:24:58,030
Your...

3478
02:24:58,510 --> 02:24:58,850
Your...

3479
02:24:58,850 --> 02:24:59,770
Your eagle power!

3480
02:24:59,990 --> 02:25:00,330
But...

3481
02:25:00,330 --> 02:25:01,230
What does that mean?

3482
02:25:04,190 --> 02:25:05,690
What does that mean?

3483
02:25:06,150 --> 02:25:06,830
Oh!

3484
02:25:06,970 --> 02:25:07,930
The glowing flag?

3485
02:25:10,310 --> 02:25:11,970
Does anything glow to you?

3486
02:25:12,210 --> 02:25:13,590
Does anything...

3487
02:25:15,590 --> 02:25:16,130
Oh wait!

3488
02:25:16,310 --> 02:25:16,570
There it is!

3489
02:25:16,670 --> 02:25:17,130
There it is!

3490
02:25:17,790 --> 02:25:18,270
Wait!

3491
02:25:21,390 --> 02:25:22,390
Wait, it's gone!

3492
02:25:25,130 --> 02:25:25,610
Oh!

3493
02:25:25,770 --> 02:25:26,290
There it is!

3494
02:25:26,410 --> 02:25:27,030
It glows!

3495
02:25:28,150 --> 02:25:29,570
That's the right formation!

3496
02:25:31,410 --> 02:25:32,410
Is it this one?

3497
02:25:36,730 --> 02:25:37,970
Where do I go now?

3498
02:25:41,500 --> 02:25:42,920
Which way is the right way?

3499
02:25:44,580 --> 02:25:45,660
Do I go straight?

3500
02:25:45,880 --> 02:25:47,540
We've entered the gate of life.

3501
02:25:48,360 --> 02:25:50,160
The correct point of attack.

3502
02:25:50,900 --> 02:25:52,920
We can break their defense from there.

3503
02:25:53,080 --> 02:25:53,920
Where do I go?

3504
02:25:57,040 --> 02:25:58,960
I'm gonna go the wrong way, aren't I?

3505
02:25:58,960 --> 02:26:00,020
I'm gonna die...

3506
02:26:00,020 --> 02:26:01,620
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

3507
02:26:01,700 --> 02:26:03,620
So you're trying to break our formation.

3508
02:26:04,900 --> 02:26:06,660
Not if I stop you first.

3509
02:26:08,060 --> 02:26:08,420
Okay.

3510
02:26:09,680 --> 02:26:12,240
Let's defeat that officer, and weaken their formation.

3511
02:26:12,480 --> 02:26:12,640
Okay.

3512
02:26:12,820 --> 02:26:13,600
We're weakening it.

3513
02:26:15,740 --> 02:26:18,020
I'm just like, where do I go after though?

3514
02:26:18,660 --> 02:26:19,560
Instructions unclear!

3515
02:26:27,500 --> 02:26:28,780
Oh my god.

3516
02:26:28,780 --> 02:26:29,920
Oh my god.

3517
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:31,340
He has no name!

3518
02:26:31,700 --> 02:26:33,660
Why are you so strong?!

3519
02:26:33,660 --> 02:26:38,000
Oh, that was a long war.

3520
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:39,380
We'll do something about this.

3521
02:26:40,280 --> 02:26:43,220
Any more surprises like that will make it difficult.

3522
02:26:44,780 --> 02:26:45,480
Okay, nice.

3523
02:26:46,960 --> 02:26:47,820
Cao Cao.

3524
02:26:48,520 --> 02:26:51,580
I must prevent him from continuing on his path.

3525
02:26:52,100 --> 02:26:53,860
Oh my god, he said, help me!

3526
02:26:54,760 --> 02:26:56,460
And after that, I cannot lose Liu Bei.

3527
02:26:57,020 --> 02:26:57,620
Shadow!

3528
02:26:58,040 --> 02:26:58,720
Or Silver!

3529
02:27:00,700 --> 02:27:07,960
Weak-willed followers of Cao Cao, bloodied on his path to domination, become lost in the fog.

3530
02:27:08,160 --> 02:27:08,480
Oh my god.

3531
02:27:08,960 --> 02:27:10,620
And lament your deeds.

3532
02:27:11,080 --> 02:27:13,340
Oh my god, he lit the incense.

3533
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:15,920
What is this ghastly fog?

3534
02:27:16,100 --> 02:27:17,420
Oh my god, it's the incense!

3535
02:27:20,100 --> 02:27:22,920
He used the power of incense, guys!

3536
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:27,080
The formation is beginning to break.

3537
02:27:27,380 --> 02:27:29,140
Let us strike before they recover.

3538
02:27:30,480 --> 02:27:31,960
I'm trying my best!

3539
02:27:36,620 --> 02:27:37,420
What is this?

3540
02:27:37,420 --> 02:27:37,600
What is this?

3541
02:27:37,680 --> 02:27:38,440
What is this?

3542
02:27:38,780 --> 02:27:40,380
Everyone, keep this up!

3543
02:27:41,320 --> 02:27:42,020
With all my might.

3544
02:27:42,460 --> 02:27:43,080
All right.

3545
02:27:43,760 --> 02:27:44,140
We did it.

3546
02:27:44,320 --> 02:27:46,240
The enemy officer has been defeated.

3547
02:27:46,740 --> 02:27:47,900
That should be the...

3548
02:27:47,900 --> 02:27:49,720
We've almost destroyed their eight gates formation.

3549
02:27:50,860 --> 02:27:51,420
Let's go.

3550
02:27:51,620 --> 02:27:52,560
All right, let's get out of here.

3551
02:27:52,720 --> 02:27:53,680
Let's get some distance from the formation for now.

3552
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,300
We will enter from another gate to finish them off.

3553
02:27:56,380 --> 02:27:57,400
All right, give me a sec.

3554
02:27:58,980 --> 02:28:00,540
I'm gonna go kill...

3555
02:28:00,540 --> 02:28:02,000
Cheng Yao real fast.

3556
02:28:02,420 --> 02:28:04,940
A tactical mind is truly a great blessing.

3557
02:28:06,960 --> 02:28:08,440
Okay, I've escaped from there.

3558
02:28:08,540 --> 02:28:10,220
Okay, we have like one more to go.

3559
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,180
The enemy attacks us where we are most vulnerable.

3560
02:28:16,300 --> 02:28:18,120
So much for an easy victory.

3561
02:28:18,120 --> 02:28:22,240
Now it's the border gate formation.

3562
02:28:24,960 --> 02:28:27,660
When did they get a strategist?

3563
02:28:29,640 --> 02:28:31,800
We got them in the first half.

3564
02:28:31,800 --> 02:28:35,300
They thought it was just brute force because I didn't know what the fuck I was doing.

3565
02:28:36,820 --> 02:28:38,540
I'm glad that the skills don't use you.

3566
02:28:38,540 --> 02:28:40,660
Where the fuck did they actually get...

3567
02:28:40,660 --> 02:28:41,880
Like, people could think.

3568
02:28:45,560 --> 02:28:46,900
Alright, don't worry.

3569
02:28:47,720 --> 02:28:49,740
I'm gonna go do a little...

3570
02:28:49,740 --> 02:28:50,540
little...

3571
02:28:50,540 --> 02:28:52,020
side quest here.

3572
02:28:52,320 --> 02:28:53,200
And meet Bai Liang.

3573
02:28:53,900 --> 02:28:54,220
Hello.

3574
02:28:59,620 --> 02:29:01,000
Hello, that's me.

3575
02:29:03,840 --> 02:29:04,480
Nope.

3576
02:29:05,080 --> 02:29:06,780
I'm gonna fight him.

3577
02:29:08,620 --> 02:29:10,880
They're like, let me handle this.

3578
02:29:11,040 --> 02:29:11,880
And I was like, no!

3579
02:29:12,900 --> 02:29:15,000
I wanna fight you!

3580
02:29:21,380 --> 02:29:22,100
That's right.

3581
02:29:27,700 --> 02:29:28,820
Oh my god, wait.

3582
02:29:29,040 --> 02:29:29,540
It's not fair.

3583
02:29:31,360 --> 02:29:32,040
It's fine.

3584
02:29:34,380 --> 02:29:37,240
Like, I said that, but I'm already, like, here beating him up.

3585
02:29:37,800 --> 02:29:39,500
From where I shall roar!

3586
02:29:40,280 --> 02:29:41,840
Oh, he, like, walked away.

3587
02:29:42,880 --> 02:29:43,840
He just...

3588
02:29:43,840 --> 02:29:45,120
He just...

3589
02:29:45,120 --> 02:29:46,540
Watch this, guys.

3590
02:29:47,180 --> 02:29:47,960
Oh my god!

3591
02:29:48,040 --> 02:29:49,340
Okay, watch this, though.

3592
02:29:50,420 --> 02:29:51,020
There we go.

3593
02:29:51,060 --> 02:29:51,860
I believe...

3594
02:29:51,860 --> 02:29:53,820
It's literally one guy.

3595
02:29:54,040 --> 02:29:56,100
There's no way you can fuck this up, guys.

3596
02:29:56,100 --> 02:29:57,200
There's...

3597
02:29:57,200 --> 02:29:58,320
There's...

3598
02:29:59,860 --> 02:30:01,180
It's not overkill.

3599
02:30:01,400 --> 02:30:01,800
It's literally...

3600
02:30:01,800 --> 02:30:03,100
He literally worked for Lu Bu.

3601
02:30:03,280 --> 02:30:04,300
It's never...

3602
02:30:04,300 --> 02:30:04,680
Overkill.

3603
02:30:05,360 --> 02:30:05,660
I see it.

3604
02:30:10,080 --> 02:30:10,680
Alright.

3605
02:30:12,900 --> 02:30:13,500
Boom.

3606
02:30:15,320 --> 02:30:15,920
Ariel.

3607
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:17,540
Let's end this.

3608
02:30:18,620 --> 02:30:19,220
Yeah!

3609
02:30:21,300 --> 02:30:22,640
It's just that easy.

3610
02:30:23,420 --> 02:30:25,300
However, we shall meet in battle again.

3611
02:30:26,100 --> 02:30:27,180
Let you do it.

3612
02:30:27,640 --> 02:30:29,040
My job here is done.

3613
02:30:29,640 --> 02:30:30,620
What did you do?

3614
02:30:30,980 --> 02:30:32,880
You just lit a bunch of incense.

3615
02:30:33,420 --> 02:30:34,520
And do what you must.

3616
02:30:34,920 --> 02:30:36,660
What the fuck did you do, Bai Liang?

3617
02:30:36,960 --> 02:30:38,900
You literally just lit incense!

3618
02:30:39,540 --> 02:30:41,280
I did most of the job.

3619
02:30:43,600 --> 02:30:45,380
But you didn't do anything.

3620
02:30:47,140 --> 02:30:48,120
Let's go back.

3621
02:30:48,760 --> 02:30:50,400
And he did it well.

3622
02:30:51,420 --> 02:30:53,520
That's all you need to know, Doki.

3623
02:30:56,140 --> 02:30:56,640
Alright.

3624
02:30:57,560 --> 02:30:58,750
Oh wait, we did the...

3625
02:31:01,200 --> 02:31:02,320
Okay, we did that.

3626
02:31:02,960 --> 02:31:03,880
And then...

3627
02:31:03,880 --> 02:31:04,540
Oh, the wheels!

3628
02:31:04,740 --> 02:31:06,000
I forgot about the wheels.

3629
02:31:06,320 --> 02:31:06,460
Okay.

3630
02:31:07,400 --> 02:31:08,080
Wheels time.

3631
02:31:09,620 --> 02:31:10,580
Is that the strongest?

3632
02:31:10,760 --> 02:31:12,200
No, this is the strongest wheel I have.

3633
02:31:14,480 --> 02:31:16,460
Alright, time to find the last gate.

3634
02:31:17,580 --> 02:31:18,080
Gah!

3635
02:31:20,660 --> 02:31:21,160
Gah!

3636
02:31:21,160 --> 02:31:21,200
Okay.

3637
02:31:22,040 --> 02:31:23,200
Where's the last gate?

3638
02:31:24,560 --> 02:31:25,060
Gah!

3639
02:31:27,600 --> 02:31:28,980
No, not this one.

3640
02:31:29,440 --> 02:31:30,040
Guys, don't worry.

3641
02:31:30,100 --> 02:31:31,540
I'm not gonna preforce this.

3642
02:31:32,320 --> 02:31:33,200
Don't worry.

3643
02:31:33,580 --> 02:31:35,440
We're gonna figure this out together.

3644
02:31:35,960 --> 02:31:37,140
Oh my god, I almost went through.

3645
02:31:37,180 --> 02:31:37,960
Oh wait, it's right here!

3646
02:31:39,620 --> 02:31:40,520
Is that glowing?

3647
02:31:41,320 --> 02:31:42,600
Yeah, it's right here.

3648
02:31:43,060 --> 02:31:44,100
That's glowing, right?

3649
02:31:44,780 --> 02:31:45,600
I can't tell.

3650
02:31:47,660 --> 02:31:48,860
That's glowing, right?

3651
02:31:51,020 --> 02:31:51,540
Yeah.

3652
02:31:52,140 --> 02:31:52,260
Okay.

3653
02:31:52,620 --> 02:31:53,100
This is it.

3654
02:31:54,420 --> 02:31:54,460
Alright.

3655
02:31:55,020 --> 02:31:56,960
We've gone in through the gate of opening.

3656
02:31:57,420 --> 02:31:59,020
That should be the end of it.

3657
02:32:03,160 --> 02:32:03,680
Intruders?

3658
02:32:04,160 --> 02:32:06,200
You've got a bad feeling about this.

3659
02:32:06,700 --> 02:32:08,360
You need to defend this area.

3660
02:32:08,580 --> 02:32:09,880
With everything we have.

3661
02:32:10,600 --> 02:32:11,120
Concentrate.

3662
02:32:12,040 --> 02:32:12,720
Nice.

3663
02:32:12,980 --> 02:32:13,080
Okay.

3664
02:32:16,880 --> 02:32:18,120
Alright, I should...

3665
02:32:18,120 --> 02:32:19,280
I should really...

3666
02:32:19,280 --> 02:32:22,560
I should really swap my weapon actually.

3667
02:32:23,280 --> 02:32:26,540
I forgot how weak they are right now.

3668
02:32:27,820 --> 02:32:28,500
Uh...

3669
02:32:28,500 --> 02:32:29,760
Wait, actually...

3670
02:32:29,760 --> 02:32:31,400
Sword by...

3671
02:32:31,400 --> 02:32:32,320
Is that the strongest?

3672
02:32:33,280 --> 02:32:34,760
Wait, that is the strongest.

3673
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:36,060
Okay, but this is so weak.

3674
02:32:36,280 --> 02:32:36,400
Yeah.

3675
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:38,740
Yeah, this weapon is definitely stronger.

3676
02:32:38,740 --> 02:32:39,260
Let's go!

3677
02:32:40,060 --> 02:32:41,300
Okay, you know what?

3678
02:32:42,340 --> 02:32:42,980
Gotcha!

3679
02:32:43,480 --> 02:32:43,940
It's time!

3680
02:32:45,800 --> 02:32:46,560
It's ice time!

3681
02:32:49,660 --> 02:32:50,800
It's ice time!

3682
02:32:51,420 --> 02:32:51,680
It's ice time!

3683
02:32:53,240 --> 02:32:54,140
That's right!

3684
02:32:56,520 --> 02:32:58,020
Oh shit, you're too far!

3685
02:32:58,360 --> 02:32:58,740
Please!

3686
02:32:58,920 --> 02:32:59,400
Get closer!

3687
02:33:01,160 --> 02:33:01,820
Oh, nice.

3688
02:33:01,960 --> 02:33:02,360
It's still hit.

3689
02:33:02,620 --> 02:33:02,720
Nice.

3690
02:33:02,820 --> 02:33:03,740
Thank God for the walls.

3691
02:33:04,060 --> 02:33:05,600
To have you here is all I need.

3692
02:33:06,600 --> 02:33:06,940
There we go.

3693
02:33:07,160 --> 02:33:07,980
I'm counting on you.

3694
02:33:08,160 --> 02:33:09,080
Now and beyond.

3695
02:33:10,360 --> 02:33:11,200
Let's end this.

3696
02:33:11,680 --> 02:33:12,540
Gonna break your neck!

3697
02:33:13,560 --> 02:33:14,800
The enemy officer...

3698
02:33:15,420 --> 02:33:15,860
Yay!

3699
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:17,440
Alright.

3700
02:33:18,060 --> 02:33:19,080
And then back to the wheels.

3701
02:33:24,860 --> 02:33:26,060
Oh shit!

3702
02:33:26,720 --> 02:33:28,140
You know what?

3703
02:33:28,860 --> 02:33:30,240
Wait, actually...

3704
02:33:30,240 --> 02:33:33,120
We defeated our formation with both precision and resolve.

3705
02:33:33,880 --> 02:33:35,200
Oh, wait, I missed!

3706
02:33:36,380 --> 02:33:37,180
What?

3707
02:33:38,680 --> 02:33:39,740
I missed!

3708
02:33:40,360 --> 02:33:41,740
That's a little awkward.

3709
02:33:42,060 --> 02:33:42,260
Time to act.

3710
02:33:44,260 --> 02:33:44,880
An opening.

3711
02:33:45,320 --> 02:33:46,160
Take this!

3712
02:33:46,460 --> 02:33:47,100
Now.

3713
02:33:47,780 --> 02:33:48,580
Head!

3714
02:33:48,940 --> 02:33:49,060
Head!

3715
02:33:49,080 --> 02:33:49,700
Take this!

3716
02:33:51,620 --> 02:33:52,440
That's fine.

3717
02:33:52,780 --> 02:33:55,140
I just gotta keep using my things.

3718
02:33:56,440 --> 02:33:56,860
Oh wait!

3719
02:33:56,960 --> 02:33:57,880
He uses wheels too!

3720
02:33:58,580 --> 02:33:59,100
Oh my God!

3721
02:33:59,280 --> 02:33:59,880
Twinsies!

3722
02:34:06,800 --> 02:34:07,400
Nice.

3723
02:34:08,400 --> 02:34:09,000
Twins!

3724
02:34:11,720 --> 02:34:13,320
It's okay, dragoons.

3725
02:34:13,800 --> 02:34:15,660
Sometimes we all just miss.

3726
02:34:15,880 --> 02:34:17,320
You can't miss this one, right?

3727
02:34:17,320 --> 02:34:17,460
You know, guys.

3728
02:34:17,880 --> 02:34:19,380
Literally, he's right there.

3729
02:34:19,540 --> 02:34:20,720
I was gonna say.

3730
02:34:20,880 --> 02:34:21,740
I swear to God.

3731
02:34:21,740 --> 02:34:24,380
If you guys missed that one, I'm...

3732
02:34:24,380 --> 02:34:25,040
Oh my God!

3733
02:34:25,460 --> 02:34:26,860
Oh my God!

3734
02:34:31,430 --> 02:34:32,690
Oh my God!

3735
02:34:32,970 --> 02:34:33,230
Oh!

3736
02:34:36,230 --> 02:34:36,550
Guys.

3737
02:34:36,810 --> 02:34:37,210
Guys.

3738
02:34:37,270 --> 02:34:38,950
Guys, this is not looking so good for me right now.

3739
02:34:39,430 --> 02:34:41,070
This is actually not looking so good.

3740
02:34:43,370 --> 02:34:44,630
Oh my God.

3741
02:34:44,830 --> 02:34:46,970
Guys, I think he's better at this weapon than me.

3742
02:34:47,290 --> 02:34:49,390
Guys, I think he might be...

3743
02:34:50,010 --> 02:34:50,950
Oh my God.

3744
02:34:53,670 --> 02:34:55,010
Oh my god.

3745
02:34:55,330 --> 02:34:56,830
Oh, we did it.

3746
02:34:56,930 --> 02:34:57,310
We live.

3747
02:34:59,010 --> 02:35:00,710
Maybe he is.

3748
02:35:04,010 --> 02:35:04,970
Okay,

3749
02:35:09,210 --> 02:35:09,650
we're okay.

3750
02:35:10,270 --> 02:35:11,210
We're okay.

3751
02:35:11,730 --> 02:35:12,830
We're okay.

3752
02:35:19,250 --> 02:35:20,750
We're okay.

3753
02:35:28,810 --> 02:35:30,190
Oh my god.

3754
02:35:30,350 --> 02:35:32,650
I might have to go back and get buns later.

3755
02:35:33,070 --> 02:35:34,990
I... I don't know who I'm gonna live!

3756
02:35:39,330 --> 02:35:40,150
Oh no.

3757
02:35:40,650 --> 02:35:41,210
Oh no.

3758
02:35:42,030 --> 02:35:42,770
It's okay.

3759
02:35:43,010 --> 02:35:43,790
We have Kuan Yin!

3760
02:35:50,950 --> 02:35:53,270
Your strength, for a new path will show itself.

3761
02:35:53,450 --> 02:35:54,330
Jesus Christ.

3762
02:35:57,810 --> 02:35:58,370
It's okay.

3763
02:35:58,530 --> 02:35:58,930
We don't need it.

3764
02:35:59,410 --> 02:36:00,930
We don't need it, guys.

3765
02:36:03,390 --> 02:36:05,050
Guys, we don't need the buns.

3766
02:36:05,970 --> 02:36:06,710
Oh my god.

3767
02:36:06,710 --> 02:36:07,290
We did it.

3768
02:36:07,470 --> 02:36:07,610
Okay.

3769
02:36:08,190 --> 02:36:08,750
Oh my god.

3770
02:36:08,910 --> 02:36:11,410
We finally did his stupid fucking missions.

3771
02:36:11,750 --> 02:36:12,830
Oh my god.

3772
02:36:12,970 --> 02:36:13,190
Okay.

3773
02:36:13,490 --> 02:36:14,290
We did it.

3774
02:36:15,490 --> 02:36:19,110
Okay, we're never gonna... I don't know if we're ever gonna do that one correctly.

3775
02:36:19,350 --> 02:36:20,250
That... that seems...

3776
02:36:20,250 --> 02:36:21,910
We might need to pay the intern, guys.

3777
02:36:22,150 --> 02:36:23,970
That's... that's a lot to ask for.

3778
02:36:24,150 --> 02:36:27,190
This launch successful charger ambush five times.

3779
02:36:27,370 --> 02:36:29,110
That... that just seems like a lot.

3780
02:36:29,330 --> 02:36:30,330
That... that really does.

3781
02:36:33,070 --> 02:36:34,650
Wait, I'm not even close.

3782
02:36:35,150 --> 02:36:35,490
Wait.

3783
02:36:36,250 --> 02:36:37,870
Wait, they're like all the way over there.

3784
02:36:38,130 --> 02:36:38,410
All right.

3785
02:36:38,530 --> 02:36:38,850
Don't worry.

3786
02:36:39,010 --> 02:36:39,550
I'll just bring...

3787
02:36:39,550 --> 02:36:40,290
I won't lose.

3788
02:36:40,510 --> 02:36:42,190
I can just bring Kuan Yin into this.

3789
02:36:43,730 --> 02:36:44,550
There we go.

3790
02:36:45,050 --> 02:36:46,530
All right, Kuan Yin, it's time.

3791
02:36:49,430 --> 02:36:51,930
Yes, because I have him now.

3792
02:36:57,530 --> 02:37:00,130
No, I definitely know I win.

3793
02:37:04,150 --> 02:37:05,010
Okay.

3794
02:37:08,870 --> 02:37:13,870
Is that it?

3795
02:37:14,110 --> 02:37:15,370
From Kuan Yin.

3796
02:37:18,760 --> 02:37:21,450
What do you mean, is that it?

3797
02:37:21,650 --> 02:37:23,150
What just happened?

3798
02:37:23,490 --> 02:37:24,810
That's fucking right.

3799
02:37:24,810 --> 02:37:26,510
What just happened?

3800
02:37:26,950 --> 02:37:28,610
Get over here!

3801
02:37:31,090 --> 02:37:34,310
I am the god of war!

3802
02:37:35,210 --> 02:37:36,950
And it's over.

3803
02:37:38,790 --> 02:37:39,870
Easy.

3804
02:37:41,530 --> 02:37:44,630
Is that it?

3805
02:37:49,270 --> 02:37:51,170
Wan-Yoon smash!

3806
02:37:52,110 --> 02:37:53,190
Yay!

3807
02:37:57,120 --> 02:37:58,320
Alright, nice.

3808
02:38:00,380 --> 02:38:01,020
Yeah.

3809
02:38:02,440 --> 02:38:03,780
Finally leveled up.

3810
02:38:04,760 --> 02:38:05,140
Yeah!

3811
02:38:05,600 --> 02:38:07,040
My horse is a little stronger!

3812
02:38:14,140 --> 02:38:18,320
Yeah, I finally made enough money for Pantone.

3813
02:38:20,020 --> 02:38:24,120
This grants a very small chance of receiving guard support when attacked.

3814
02:38:25,200 --> 02:38:26,120
That's not even me.

3815
02:38:26,220 --> 02:38:27,900
My dragoons die before they can do that.

3816
02:38:31,480 --> 02:38:32,760
We did it, guys.

3817
02:38:33,060 --> 02:38:34,220
We broke the formation.

3818
02:38:35,060 --> 02:38:36,340
The egg is ours!

3819
02:38:41,150 --> 02:38:43,250
I thought you served Cao Cao.

3820
02:38:43,950 --> 02:38:46,450
But now I see you in the camp of Liu Bei.

3821
02:38:48,810 --> 02:38:50,050
Liu Bei is my lord.

3822
02:38:50,050 --> 02:38:50,810
I see.

3823
02:38:52,490 --> 02:38:54,910
Liu Bei has an important role to play.

3824
02:38:54,950 --> 02:38:56,950
It is to eradicate Cao Cao.

3825
02:38:57,670 --> 02:38:59,210
And through him, the Han.

3826
02:38:59,490 --> 02:39:00,790
Oh my god, even like...

3827
02:39:00,790 --> 02:39:01,610
He must be protected.

3828
02:39:01,610 --> 02:39:04,630
Even like the peace people are like, I can fix it.

3829
02:39:08,370 --> 02:39:11,630
The heart of the sacred bird has grown still.

3830
02:39:11,910 --> 02:39:12,990
Wait, that wasn't you?

3831
02:39:13,650 --> 02:39:15,930
The young boy grew to be a man.

3832
02:39:15,950 --> 02:39:16,870
Yeah, that was you!

3833
02:39:17,250 --> 02:39:18,450
And over the years...

3834
02:39:18,450 --> 02:39:19,850
Why do I still see you?

3835
02:39:19,850 --> 02:39:23,550
The horse gave way to rage and hatred.

3836
02:39:24,470 --> 02:39:28,770
Wandering the boundless world, searching for the purest revenge.

3837
02:39:29,770 --> 02:39:30,570
Thirsting...

3838
02:39:30,570 --> 02:39:31,850
God, the incense goes hard!

3839
02:39:32,210 --> 02:39:32,610
Guys!

3840
02:39:33,650 --> 02:39:35,530
This incense is crazy!

3841
02:39:35,530 --> 02:39:39,030
And then, he came upon the people of the north.

3842
02:39:39,890 --> 02:39:43,810
But how could you possibly fathom what lies within his heart?

3843
02:39:45,850 --> 02:39:54,290
How can one who has forgotten everything possibly see into the mind of one who remembers everything?

3844
02:39:54,870 --> 02:40:00,130
The paths taken by the two of you shall never cross.

3845
02:40:01,150 --> 02:40:04,430
Now, there is only one way to reach the end.

3846
02:40:04,430 --> 02:40:08,350
Through your shared trust and mutual resolve.

3847
02:40:16,490 --> 02:40:17,090
Oh!

3848
02:40:18,690 --> 02:40:21,930
Cao Cao's eight gates formation was undeniably impressive.

3849
02:40:23,090 --> 02:40:27,430
But even so, it shattered like a vase before the might of our forces.

3850
02:40:28,410 --> 02:40:31,670
And more than anyone, we have you to thank for that, Shishu.

3851
02:40:31,830 --> 02:40:33,570
Oh my god, our first strategist!

3852
02:40:33,850 --> 02:40:34,830
Who would have thought?

3853
02:40:35,590 --> 02:40:36,190
Remarkable.

3854
02:40:36,610 --> 02:40:38,010
I wouldn't say that, my lord.

3855
02:40:38,010 --> 02:40:40,630
We actually had someone to thank for us, guys!

3856
02:40:40,630 --> 02:40:41,890
I just know a few things that are useful and make him back alive.

3857
02:40:41,890 --> 02:40:43,110
It's not just jocks!

3858
02:40:43,470 --> 02:40:45,210
We have an actual nerd!

3859
02:40:45,210 --> 02:40:45,970
The sleeping dragon?

3860
02:40:46,350 --> 02:40:46,950
Huh?

3861
02:40:48,010 --> 02:40:48,610
The sleeping dragon?

3862
02:40:48,610 --> 02:40:49,510
Or is it fledgling phoenix?

3863
02:40:50,270 --> 02:40:50,850
I can't decide.

3864
02:40:51,630 --> 02:40:53,870
My lord, I don't...

3865
02:40:53,870 --> 02:40:54,710
Hmm...

3866
02:40:54,710 --> 02:40:59,070
I thought if I dropped it casually into a conversation, I might trick you into confessing.

3867
02:40:59,490 --> 02:41:01,790
You think I'm the sleeping dragon?

3868
02:41:01,970 --> 02:41:03,810
Or the fledgling phoenix?

3869
02:41:09,350 --> 02:41:11,030
That's awkward.

3870
02:41:12,710 --> 02:41:14,330
That's awkward.

3871
02:41:28,030 --> 02:41:33,690
That's so sad because none of the things...

3872
02:41:33,690 --> 02:41:35,630
Either of them did not do that.

3873
02:41:36,030 --> 02:41:38,230
They were not able to fix him.

3874
02:41:56,410 --> 02:42:03,270
I can tell this... I feel like this voice actor is Asian.

3875
02:42:04,910 --> 02:42:08,110
Because his pronunciation is actually so good.

3876
02:42:09,570 --> 02:42:10,250
Like...

3877
02:42:10,250 --> 02:42:11,790
The Fletchling Phoenix.

3878
02:42:12,170 --> 02:42:15,610
Yes, I suppose I have been known by that name.

3879
02:42:16,030 --> 02:42:23,070
And I'm sure Shishu has told you that I would be delighted to serve Lord Liu Bei.

3880
02:42:24,070 --> 02:42:26,330
But I'm afraid you were misled.

3881
02:42:26,730 --> 02:42:30,050
I've had my fill of generals and warlords.

3882
02:42:30,470 --> 02:42:33,370
For now, I'm leading a peaceful life.

3883
02:42:35,590 --> 02:42:36,610
Are you sure?

3884
02:42:36,950 --> 02:42:38,770
Don't you want to just, you know, die?

3885
02:42:39,470 --> 02:42:40,050
Randomly?

3886
02:42:40,050 --> 02:42:41,910
From, like, rocks?

3887
02:42:42,310 --> 02:42:43,210
Today, at least.

3888
02:42:43,850 --> 02:42:45,010
Would that be silly?

3889
02:42:45,470 --> 02:42:47,210
I truly believe that Lord Liu Bei is a great man.

3890
02:42:47,210 --> 02:42:47,830
Did that happen?

3891
02:42:47,830 --> 02:42:49,890
It would be an honor to serve him.

3892
02:42:50,130 --> 02:42:52,930
But let's just say, the timing isn't right.

3893
02:42:53,490 --> 02:42:53,950
No.

3894
02:42:54,550 --> 02:42:57,370
Right now, it's the quiet life for me.

3895
02:42:57,790 --> 02:43:03,750
But I hope you will be a friend and not mention this meeting to Lord Liu Bei.

3896
02:43:04,830 --> 02:43:11,790
If his lordship does ask about me, just tell him... tell him that the time isn't right.

3897
02:43:12,470 --> 02:43:14,570
Yeah, it's not his time to die yet, guys.

3898
02:43:15,470 --> 02:43:16,430
He's like...

3899
02:43:16,430 --> 02:43:19,390
I'll only join when it's, like, almost closer to my desk.

3900
02:43:20,830 --> 02:43:23,570
All right, assistance in Shu province.

3901
02:43:23,910 --> 02:43:25,750
Okay, let me... let's go grab...

3902
02:43:26,890 --> 02:43:27,870
Oh, never mind.

3903
02:43:27,890 --> 02:43:29,590
I was gonna say, is there, like, strong...

3904
02:43:29,590 --> 02:43:30,890
Yeah, no, the weapons suck.

3905
02:43:31,170 --> 02:43:31,810
All right.

3906
02:43:33,170 --> 02:43:33,970
Let us...

3907
02:43:33,970 --> 02:43:36,370
check if we have any friendship meters.

3908
02:43:36,710 --> 02:43:37,090
Oh, yeah!

3909
02:43:37,270 --> 02:43:37,670
Penton!

3910
02:43:37,670 --> 02:43:40,370
We leveled up your friendship, so will you wanna join me now?

3911
02:43:44,800 --> 02:43:46,480
Oh my god, it's still him.

3912
02:43:46,980 --> 02:43:48,840
Wait, but I leveled up your friendship.

3913
02:43:50,580 --> 02:43:50,980
Wait.

3914
02:43:52,320 --> 02:43:53,180
Where are you?

3915
02:43:54,120 --> 02:43:55,120
Oh, there he is.

3916
02:43:55,740 --> 02:43:56,860
I was like...

3917
02:43:56,860 --> 02:43:58,460
Wait, I thought you wanted to talk to...

3918
02:43:58,460 --> 02:43:59,260
Oh, there he is.

3919
02:44:01,720 --> 02:44:02,700
You are a wonder.

3920
02:44:03,080 --> 02:44:04,660
I was just hoping they'd come by sooner.

3921
02:44:04,860 --> 02:44:05,360
Here you are.

3922
02:44:06,080 --> 02:44:07,320
Do you think you can do me a favor?

3923
02:44:07,780 --> 02:44:09,400
I'm almost out of incense here.

3924
02:44:09,620 --> 02:44:11,760
I'd like to find me something high quality.

3925
02:44:12,420 --> 02:44:13,500
You have to find...

3926
02:44:13,500 --> 02:44:14,560
Okay, in the mountains.

3927
02:44:14,860 --> 02:44:16,480
Okay, it's, like, literally where I live.

3928
02:44:18,520 --> 02:44:19,640
Should be here, right?

3929
02:44:23,270 --> 02:44:23,630
Ah!

3930
02:44:23,910 --> 02:44:24,610
Yeah, there it is.

3931
02:44:24,890 --> 02:44:26,030
I recognize that.

3932
02:44:27,030 --> 02:44:27,970
All right, don't worry.

3933
02:44:28,050 --> 02:44:29,150
I got you the good shit.

3934
02:44:30,610 --> 02:44:34,630
These are the type of incense where I actually started seeing some crazy shit.

3935
02:44:38,430 --> 02:44:40,750
You don't see something like this every day.

3936
02:44:41,750 --> 02:44:45,250
A scent that is both difficult to describe and yet absolutely captivating.

3937
02:44:46,090 --> 02:44:47,050
A little bit like you.

3938
02:44:47,310 --> 02:44:49,090
This is wonderful, thank you.

3939
02:44:49,830 --> 02:44:50,570
Okay, nice.

3940
02:44:50,950 --> 02:44:52,370
Now we're extra friends.

3941
02:44:53,790 --> 02:44:55,410
Okay, I'm just gonna pay.

3942
02:44:55,910 --> 02:44:56,870
I can't.

3943
02:44:57,830 --> 02:45:00,310
I don't think I can do the ambush thing correctly.

3944
02:45:02,350 --> 02:45:02,870
Yay!

3945
02:45:05,470 --> 02:45:06,190
I'm sorry.

3946
02:45:06,270 --> 02:45:07,930
I had to pay the intern, guys.

3947
02:45:08,430 --> 02:45:10,990
He couldn't just do extra credit his whole life.

3948
02:45:11,570 --> 02:45:12,610
Oh, I got another one.

3949
02:45:19,700 --> 02:45:21,260
Now do you want to join LuBe?

3950
02:45:22,300 --> 02:45:24,960
You seem to be in rather high spirits.

3951
02:45:26,200 --> 02:45:27,260
Oh, yes.

3952
02:45:28,180 --> 02:45:30,800
Might you remember what I said to you before?

3953
02:45:31,740 --> 02:45:33,000
You are no one.

3954
02:45:33,300 --> 02:45:35,140
So you can yet be someone.

3955
02:45:35,880 --> 02:45:37,480
And you can be someone.

3956
02:45:37,900 --> 02:45:39,260
And yet you are still...

3957
02:45:39,900 --> 02:45:40,780
No one.

3958
02:45:41,280 --> 02:45:43,340
Oh, that's why they write me out of history.

3959
02:45:43,980 --> 02:45:44,880
Ring true to you?

3960
02:45:46,080 --> 02:45:46,660
Yeah.

3961
02:45:47,080 --> 02:45:47,780
Yeah, it does.

3962
02:45:47,780 --> 02:45:48,120
Because...

3963
02:45:48,120 --> 02:45:53,000
Ever since I killed LuBu and they, like, didn't even include me in the cutscene, I realized...

3964
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:54,300
Ah, excellent.

3965
02:45:54,660 --> 02:45:57,340
I knew my faith in you was not ill-placed.

3966
02:45:57,820 --> 02:46:00,780
What you choose will, in turn...

3967
02:46:01,520 --> 02:46:02,980
be who you become.

3968
02:46:04,400 --> 02:46:04,960
That's...

3969
02:46:04,960 --> 02:46:06,660
what I wanted to say.

3970
02:46:07,500 --> 02:46:11,640
Right now, you're figuring out the path you should take.

3971
02:46:12,020 --> 02:46:14,320
It's plain to see on your face.

3972
02:46:15,220 --> 02:46:17,620
The path you ought to take.

3973
02:46:18,260 --> 02:46:18,940
Hmm.

3974
02:46:20,880 --> 02:46:22,140
Do you know something?

3975
02:46:22,880 --> 02:46:23,240
No, no.

3976
02:46:23,420 --> 02:46:26,180
I'm afraid I was giving advice beyond my station.

3977
02:46:27,120 --> 02:46:27,800
For...

3978
02:46:27,800 --> 02:46:30,340
What kind of person am I?

3979
02:46:30,600 --> 02:46:32,500
What kind of person...

3980
02:46:32,500 --> 02:46:33,520
will I become?

3981
02:46:34,420 --> 02:46:39,340
I have no right to speak of such things to others while I myself remain unsure.

3982
02:46:40,320 --> 02:46:41,000
I...

3983
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:42,680
Well, it is a shameful thing.

3984
02:46:44,540 --> 02:46:46,300
Giga, thank you for the super chat.

3985
02:46:46,420 --> 02:46:47,060
Thank you, thank you.

3986
02:46:47,180 --> 02:46:48,380
For ambushes and charges.

3987
02:46:48,720 --> 02:46:49,820
Grind on skirmishes.

3988
02:46:50,660 --> 02:46:52,340
But this is not Pokemon.

3989
02:46:52,840 --> 02:46:54,300
I'm playing Mario on...

3990
02:46:54,300 --> 02:46:55,460
on Saturday.

3991
02:46:56,840 --> 02:46:58,360
We're gonna be grinding.

3992
02:46:58,980 --> 02:46:59,920
I might as...

3993
02:47:00,440 --> 02:47:02,700
We'll do that on Saturday anyway.

3994
02:47:02,700 --> 02:47:02,940
Don't they?

3995
02:47:03,020 --> 02:47:04,820
A further loss of face.

3996
02:47:05,120 --> 02:47:07,240
Now you're the one encouraging me.

3997
02:47:07,900 --> 02:47:11,900
Each time we interact, I walk away feeling energized anew.

3998
02:47:13,700 --> 02:47:19,100
Now, I've no excuse to avoid putting my all into the matters ahead.

3999
02:47:20,960 --> 02:47:22,800
It's okay, I can pay to win.

4000
02:47:22,800 --> 02:47:23,240
I'll...

4001
02:47:23,240 --> 02:47:23,620
I...

4002
02:47:23,620 --> 02:47:24,940
I have 50k.

4003
02:47:25,240 --> 02:47:25,800
It's fine.

4004
02:47:26,720 --> 02:47:27,320
It's...

4005
02:47:27,320 --> 02:47:28,300
It's fine.

4006
02:47:31,040 --> 02:47:32,260
That one...

4007
02:47:32,260 --> 02:47:35,220
That conversation felt, like, really useless.

4008
02:47:35,280 --> 02:47:36,200
Not gonna lie.

4009
02:47:36,240 --> 02:47:37,580
Show him what you're made of.

4010
02:47:40,870 --> 02:47:41,590
Alright.

4011
02:47:41,890 --> 02:47:42,390
Uh...

4012
02:47:42,390 --> 02:47:43,890
We gotta...

4013
02:47:43,890 --> 02:47:44,950
Okay.

4014
02:47:45,170 --> 02:47:46,030
He's right here.

4015
02:47:46,030 --> 02:47:46,210
Yeah.

4016
02:47:47,530 --> 02:47:50,470
I wish there was, like, another fast travel for this area.

4017
02:47:53,550 --> 02:47:54,110
Alright.

4018
02:47:57,330 --> 02:47:59,110
Let's increase our bond in turn.

4019
02:48:09,900 --> 02:48:11,020
That's our whole thing!

4020
02:48:22,280 --> 02:48:23,680
Yes, my lord.

4021
02:48:24,100 --> 02:48:24,960
Got it.

4022
02:48:25,480 --> 02:48:26,620
Lord Chaoyun.

4023
02:48:27,100 --> 02:48:28,620
I'll be more diligent.

4024
02:48:31,630 --> 02:48:33,250
I don't understand.

4025
02:48:34,690 --> 02:48:35,890
Do we...

4026
02:48:35,890 --> 02:48:38,210
Your force is, like, literally the Shu kingdom.

4027
02:48:38,610 --> 02:48:39,130
Special!

4028
02:48:39,670 --> 02:48:40,330
Oh, it's you.

4029
02:48:40,810 --> 02:48:45,590
So, you saw Lord Chaoyun and Lord Guan Yu reprimanding me just now, huh?

4030
02:48:46,350 --> 02:48:48,250
He's now officially taking me under his wing!

4031
02:48:48,730 --> 02:48:50,930
Though the novelty wore off in an instant.

4032
02:48:51,690 --> 02:48:52,370
But, uh...

4033
02:48:52,370 --> 02:48:54,570
This was my first time learning to fight for real.

4034
02:48:55,390 --> 02:49:00,070
After the yellow turbans were defeated, it took everything I had just to eek out a living as some second one bandit.

4035
02:49:00,070 --> 02:49:00,350
I miss...

4036
02:49:00,350 --> 02:49:01,250
I miss...

4037
02:49:01,250 --> 02:49:01,650
I miss...

4038
02:49:01,650 --> 02:49:03,170
I can't wait to do...

4039
02:49:04,670 --> 02:49:05,190
Um...

4040
02:49:05,190 --> 02:49:06,410
To do the Red Army.

4041
02:49:07,250 --> 02:49:07,770
But...

4042
02:49:07,770 --> 02:49:08,530
Because, like...

4043
02:49:09,090 --> 02:49:11,010
Because then, like, we could talk to Gan Ning.

4044
02:49:12,370 --> 02:49:14,830
Cause our first encounter with him was crazy.

4045
02:49:16,070 --> 02:49:17,550
He's a great teacher.

4046
02:49:17,890 --> 02:49:18,830
Good for you.

4047
02:49:18,830 --> 02:49:20,870
Yeah, he is a great teacher.

4048
02:49:21,410 --> 02:49:22,090
Well...

4049
02:49:22,090 --> 02:49:22,190
Yeah.

4050
02:49:23,130 --> 02:49:23,810
Anyway...

4051
02:49:23,810 --> 02:49:27,030
He's really demanding and shows me absolutely no mercy.

4052
02:49:27,670 --> 02:49:28,290
But...

4053
02:49:28,290 --> 02:49:31,550
I really do get nervous around Lord Chaoyun.

4054
02:49:31,870 --> 02:49:33,930
I remember when we first met...

4055
02:49:34,850 --> 02:49:35,530
Vividly.

4056
02:49:36,330 --> 02:49:39,110
Like, that guy literally sent us love letters.

4057
02:49:39,530 --> 02:49:40,770
In our first meeting.

4058
02:49:41,450 --> 02:49:43,410
I wanna know how far that goes.

4059
02:49:43,410 --> 02:49:44,170
I...

4060
02:49:44,170 --> 02:49:46,350
I was sure you wouldn't stop until you killed me.

4061
02:49:46,830 --> 02:49:49,050
I was ready to bid this world goodbye.

4062
02:49:51,950 --> 02:49:53,170
Did you ever sell things?

4063
02:49:53,530 --> 02:49:55,110
Oh, be open with him from now on.

4064
02:49:56,050 --> 02:49:57,590
I'd really like to, you know?

4065
02:49:57,950 --> 02:50:01,770
And it's not like Lord Chaoyun hates me or anything like that.

4066
02:50:02,690 --> 02:50:03,170
But...

4067
02:50:04,590 --> 02:50:05,790
It's just tough love.

4068
02:50:06,690 --> 02:50:09,770
Tend to stick with us longer than a stain on a hat.

4069
02:50:11,050 --> 02:50:13,550
Well, whatever helps me earn Lord Chaoyun's respect.

4070
02:50:13,550 --> 02:50:16,450
Let me just send the others away while we have this place for ourselves.

4071
02:50:16,690 --> 02:50:17,470
Just you and me.

4072
02:50:17,650 --> 02:50:18,670
Oh yeah, that...

4073
02:50:20,010 --> 02:50:22,330
That was our first encounter with him too.

4074
02:50:22,610 --> 02:50:25,730
You've made it all this way on your own without anyone backing you up.

4075
02:50:26,270 --> 02:50:26,710
Yeah.

4076
02:50:27,130 --> 02:50:28,370
So I take it that you must be like me then.

4077
02:50:28,630 --> 02:50:30,930
You're just another bandit that left that life behind...

4078
02:50:30,930 --> 02:50:31,870
No, I'm sort of better.

4079
02:50:32,010 --> 02:50:34,370
I'm definitely a lot better than you.

4080
02:50:34,490 --> 02:50:35,310
We both started at the bottom.

4081
02:50:35,750 --> 02:50:38,550
But his lordship already respects you that much?

4082
02:50:39,350 --> 02:50:39,790
Amazing.

4083
02:50:41,930 --> 02:50:43,450
Where do I even begin?

4084
02:50:43,890 --> 02:50:45,090
It's fine, really.

4085
02:50:45,290 --> 02:50:47,090
It's good to have someone like you around.

4086
02:50:47,350 --> 02:50:48,470
Everyone needs a rival.

4087
02:50:48,990 --> 02:50:52,670
But I'm not letting you have my place as his top underling without a fight.

4088
02:50:52,670 --> 02:50:56,770
But if you really want it, you're going to have to earn it.

4089
02:50:57,590 --> 02:51:02,210
But anyway, I really want to show Lord Chao Yun what I can do next time.

4090
02:51:02,350 --> 02:51:04,070
So let's get some training in.

4091
02:51:04,750 --> 02:51:05,450
You ready?

4092
02:51:06,070 --> 02:51:06,910
Number two?

4093
02:51:07,130 --> 02:51:07,950
Number two?

4094
02:51:08,910 --> 02:51:09,430
What?

4095
02:51:09,610 --> 02:51:10,890
I was here first!

4096
02:51:11,350 --> 02:51:12,670
Okay, we're not...

4097
02:51:12,670 --> 02:51:16,350
Guys, I'm sorry, but we're not increasing our bond with him.

4098
02:51:19,910 --> 02:51:23,690
We're not increasing our bond with this guy.

4099
02:51:24,390 --> 02:51:25,470
And that's...

4100
02:51:25,870 --> 02:51:27,330
He will not join my harem.

4101
02:51:27,830 --> 02:51:28,190
He...

4102
02:51:30,110 --> 02:51:31,190
I'm not...

4103
02:51:31,190 --> 02:51:34,290
I'm not letting this guy into my harem.

4104
02:51:36,410 --> 02:51:37,570
Alright, let's see.

4105
02:51:38,210 --> 02:51:39,970
Deplete fortitude 200 times.

4106
02:51:40,790 --> 02:51:41,670
Withhold...

4107
02:51:41,670 --> 02:51:43,790
Continuous attacks using a...

4108
02:51:44,310 --> 02:51:44,750
Jesus...

4109
02:51:44,750 --> 02:51:45,590
I...

4110
02:51:45,590 --> 02:51:47,810
I don't understand.

4111
02:51:50,130 --> 02:51:52,510
I'm paying a win for Daoyun too.

4112
02:51:55,630 --> 02:51:58,630
You dare to think that he's better than me?

4113
02:51:58,630 --> 02:52:03,150
The other day, I told Lord Liu Bei about Zhuge Liang and Peng Tong.

4114
02:52:03,470 --> 02:52:06,330
I wanted to help his lordship in any way I could.

4115
02:52:06,830 --> 02:52:10,230
But now I'm worried they'll be angry at me for doing so.

4116
02:52:10,730 --> 02:52:12,590
You see, they're quite...

4117
02:52:13,290 --> 02:52:13,850
Well...

4118
02:52:13,850 --> 02:52:14,530
They're hermits.

4119
02:52:14,810 --> 02:52:15,370
Hermits?

4120
02:52:22,670 --> 02:52:27,510
Most men seize every opportunity to show off their talents and knowledge, however modest.

4121
02:52:27,510 --> 02:52:29,850
But those two are different.

4122
02:52:30,550 --> 02:52:35,130
Unless it's for a cause they care about, they prefer to keep their talents to themselves.

4123
02:52:36,210 --> 02:52:36,730
But...

4124
02:52:36,730 --> 02:52:44,030
I'm certain that if they got to know Lord Liu Bei, they gladly abandoned their hermit lifestyles to serve him and his cause.

4125
02:52:45,210 --> 02:52:48,090
It's not simply that Lord Liu Bei cares about us.

4126
02:52:48,250 --> 02:52:50,210
He wants to earn our trust.

4127
02:52:50,490 --> 02:52:52,910
To be the man we can turn to when we need help.

4128
02:52:53,790 --> 02:52:56,030
He's no sage, I admit that.

4129
02:52:56,910 --> 02:53:02,870
But if there was ever a man fit to rule the world and be loved by all of his subjects, it's Lord Liu Bei.

4130
02:53:04,270 --> 02:53:09,010
And if he is the man I believe him to be, then I have no doubt he would win Zhuge Liang and Peng Tong.

4131
02:53:09,010 --> 02:53:11,750
He's a really good politician, I would say that.

4132
02:53:11,850 --> 02:53:12,670
Lord Liu Bei?

4133
02:53:12,670 --> 02:53:14,670
I want to devote my life to his cause.

4134
02:53:15,910 --> 02:53:16,750
He's a really...

4135
02:53:17,430 --> 02:53:20,290
He's all talk and then he fails to do anything.

4136
02:53:25,790 --> 02:53:27,450
Dango, thank you for the super chat.

4137
02:53:27,630 --> 02:53:28,430
Thank you, thank you.

4138
02:53:29,230 --> 02:53:33,330
Doki is number four, but never number one.

4139
02:53:33,730 --> 02:53:36,670
And they say this fellow is even sharper than Shishu.

4140
02:53:36,670 --> 02:53:39,770
Now that will be something to behold.

4141
02:53:40,870 --> 02:53:42,270
It certainly will.

4142
02:53:42,990 --> 02:53:46,430
But brother, are we certain that this is the right move?

4143
02:53:47,590 --> 02:53:49,510
Shishu's guidance has been invaluable.

4144
02:53:50,370 --> 02:53:51,190
It doesn't seem right.

4145
02:53:51,190 --> 02:53:52,250
I know, right?

4146
02:53:52,630 --> 02:53:55,050
We're like, I'm done playing with you now.

4147
02:53:55,210 --> 02:53:55,810
Poor.

4148
02:53:56,810 --> 02:54:01,690
He told me that Lord Zhuge Liang was the man I needed in order to accomplish my goals.

4149
02:54:02,850 --> 02:54:05,030
It would be an insult to ignore his counsel.

4150
02:54:06,630 --> 02:54:10,990
So, we will go together to find this great strategist and ask for his help.

4151
02:54:12,170 --> 02:54:13,470
We will be gone sometime.

4152
02:54:14,290 --> 02:54:16,390
The castle is in your hands while we are gone.

4153
02:54:16,730 --> 02:54:18,190
I get to have a castle!

4154
02:54:18,770 --> 02:54:19,470
Thank you.

4155
02:54:20,110 --> 02:54:23,050
I'm determined not to let this opportunity go to waste.

4156
02:54:30,160 --> 02:54:33,720
However, Liu Bei was in low spirits when he turned from his trip to see Zhuge Liang.

4157
02:54:34,300 --> 02:54:37,040
He had been told that he was away, and so they did not meet.

4158
02:54:37,480 --> 02:54:37,820
What?

4159
02:54:39,720 --> 02:54:40,600
Just go back!

4160
02:54:40,980 --> 02:54:42,140
You look so glum, brother.

4161
02:54:43,380 --> 02:54:46,600
He may not have been home, but we did leave him a message.

4162
02:54:46,960 --> 02:54:48,780
I am certain he'll come to us.

4163
02:54:48,840 --> 02:54:49,380
Just go back!

4164
02:54:49,880 --> 02:54:50,560
Rather than later.

4165
02:54:51,800 --> 02:54:52,780
You didn't wait?

4166
02:54:53,160 --> 02:54:55,160
After all Liu Bei himself went to him for a visit.

4167
02:54:55,740 --> 02:54:59,800
Xu Gu Liang's bound to return the favor after a gift like that.

4168
02:55:01,500 --> 02:55:03,900
I think you may be overselling the value of my presence.

4169
02:55:03,900 --> 02:55:04,800
Just wait for him!

4170
02:55:05,280 --> 02:55:05,800
Yeah!

4171
02:55:06,300 --> 02:55:07,320
He has to come back home!

4172
02:55:07,580 --> 02:55:08,320
Someday or later!

4173
02:55:08,800 --> 02:55:09,820
I'm sure what you could help us for not seeing us right away.

4174
02:55:11,040 --> 02:55:13,540
We just need to be patient and wait him out.

4175
02:55:13,760 --> 02:55:15,340
Yeah, camp out at his porch.

4176
02:55:15,940 --> 02:55:16,660
Go back!

4177
02:55:18,460 --> 02:55:19,200
That's it?

4178
02:55:19,380 --> 02:55:20,580
Go back in there!

4179
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:29,620
Hello!

4180
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:31,800
Are you depressed that we're replacing you?

4181
02:55:35,630 --> 02:55:37,050
Ah, there you are.

4182
02:55:38,040 --> 02:55:39,990
I was hoping to ask you something.

4183
02:55:42,250 --> 02:55:44,410
This is just an idle thought.

4184
02:55:44,910 --> 02:55:47,050
A hypothetical, if you will.

4185
02:55:49,290 --> 02:55:53,270
Imagine that you found out someone you cared for was in grave danger.

4186
02:55:53,890 --> 02:55:58,910
If it meant saving that person, would you be willing to sacrifice something very important to you?

4187
02:55:59,150 --> 02:56:02,110
The Shu Ormi can only have one strategist.

4188
02:56:02,330 --> 02:56:04,430
That's why we had to kill off the phoenix.

4189
02:56:07,150 --> 02:56:08,890
One time we had two.

4190
02:56:09,530 --> 02:56:10,510
And then he died.

4191
02:56:16,590 --> 02:56:19,330
You really are quite blunt, aren't you, my friend?

4192
02:56:20,150 --> 02:56:22,450
I suppose it's the men who can act decisively.

4193
02:56:23,550 --> 02:56:28,730
Regardless of the choice being made, that end up having a true effect on the world.

4194
02:56:29,430 --> 02:56:32,950
I suppose it just goes to show that I'm out of my depth.

4195
02:56:33,390 --> 02:56:36,350
The decision half made is no decision at all.

4196
02:56:37,090 --> 02:56:39,830
And indecisiveness only ever leads to regret.

4197
02:56:40,830 --> 02:56:41,650
Forgive me.

4198
02:56:41,990 --> 02:56:45,850
When you are around, it seems I can't help but pardon you with such matters.

4199
02:56:46,770 --> 02:56:48,210
Disregard everything I said.

4200
02:56:51,920 --> 02:56:53,200
I'm just like, huh?

4201
02:56:58,060 --> 02:57:00,580
Well, something seems off about him, yeah.

4202
02:57:00,580 --> 02:57:00,720
Yeah.

4203
02:57:01,820 --> 02:57:02,760
Thank you for the super chat.

4204
02:57:02,960 --> 02:57:03,680
Thank you, thank you.

4205
02:57:03,840 --> 02:57:06,040
Hey, how long has it been since we left that message for Shu Ge Liang?

4206
02:57:06,480 --> 02:57:07,700
We hear anything yet?

4207
02:57:09,340 --> 02:57:09,820
No.

4208
02:57:10,800 --> 02:57:12,680
There's been no sign of a reply.

4209
02:57:14,000 --> 02:57:17,400
Perhaps, he still hasn't returned to the Hermitage.

4210
02:57:18,140 --> 02:57:21,440
Or perhaps, something has befallen him.

4211
02:57:22,380 --> 02:57:27,120
Brother, I think it might be a good idea to pay his home another visit.

4212
02:57:28,220 --> 02:57:28,700
Huh.

4213
02:57:32,040 --> 02:57:33,080
What is it, brother?

4214
02:57:34,120 --> 02:57:34,620
It's nothing.

4215
02:57:35,080 --> 02:57:35,900
Pay me no heat.

4216
02:57:36,980 --> 02:57:38,740
Let's do as Guan Yu suggests.

4217
02:57:39,080 --> 02:57:41,440
And visit Lord Shu Ge Liang's residence again.

4218
02:57:43,640 --> 02:57:45,700
I mean, that was my original plan.

4219
02:57:46,040 --> 02:57:46,980
He should have done that.

4220
02:57:47,160 --> 02:57:49,020
He should have just camped out on his porch.

4221
02:57:56,750 --> 02:57:59,770
I can tell that Jon Fei, voice actor, is not Asian.

4222
02:58:00,810 --> 02:58:02,790
Every time he says his name, it's different.

4223
02:58:02,790 --> 02:58:04,450
I don't understand it either.

4224
02:58:05,350 --> 02:58:07,450
Oh my God, he got ghosted again.

4225
02:58:08,030 --> 02:58:08,730
To avoid our brother.

4226
02:58:11,570 --> 02:58:13,450
He could be testing you.

4227
02:58:13,590 --> 02:58:15,630
Maybe he's just not interested.

4228
02:58:16,190 --> 02:58:17,790
Stop being so desperate.

4229
02:58:17,790 --> 02:58:18,650
By doing so.

4230
02:58:19,750 --> 02:58:21,810
I've had just about enough of this.

4231
02:58:22,610 --> 02:58:25,190
Whatever is going on, it's too early to tell for sure.

4232
02:58:26,610 --> 02:58:29,530
Let's give him a few more days, and then try again.

4233
02:58:30,530 --> 02:58:36,630
But, if Lord Shu Ge Liang really doesn't want to meet us, perhaps it would be better for all our saves.

4234
02:58:36,630 --> 02:58:38,010
Are we too desperate, guys?

4235
02:58:38,650 --> 02:58:40,550
Does it seem like we're a little too desperate?

4236
02:58:43,930 --> 02:58:44,930
Uh, well...

4237
02:58:45,630 --> 02:58:46,130
Uh...

4238
02:58:46,130 --> 02:58:51,410
If Shu Ge Liang had no interest in meeting you, he would have made that clear the first time you came.

4239
02:58:52,590 --> 02:58:53,090
Shishu?

4240
02:59:00,450 --> 02:59:01,450
Hey, Shishu.

4241
02:59:01,830 --> 02:59:02,550
What's wrong?

4242
02:59:02,710 --> 02:59:05,550
Why are you depressed?

4243
02:59:08,590 --> 02:59:09,710
No, I...

4244
02:59:09,710 --> 02:59:11,450
Forgive me, Lord Newbay.

4245
02:59:12,090 --> 02:59:12,750
I can't.

4246
02:59:13,170 --> 02:59:15,730
That is to say, I'm unable to continue to serve you.

4247
02:59:15,730 --> 02:59:18,470
I told you we can only have one for some reason!

4248
02:59:20,930 --> 02:59:22,750
We can't have more than...

4249
02:59:23,090 --> 02:59:23,410
What?

4250
02:59:24,770 --> 02:59:29,770
All I can say is, I have to leave for the sake of my elderly mother.

4251
02:59:30,530 --> 02:59:31,430
For your mother?

4252
02:59:31,670 --> 02:59:32,450
I see.

4253
02:59:33,810 --> 02:59:37,770
I can see in your eyes that if you had your way, you would rather stay here.

4254
02:59:38,870 --> 02:59:40,010
It's like a rule!

4255
02:59:40,430 --> 02:59:42,870
And if there's more than one, they kill them off!

4256
02:59:43,150 --> 02:59:45,610
Such female society is to be admired, especially in this day and age.

4257
02:59:46,290 --> 02:59:47,970
I won't try to change your mind.

4258
02:59:48,610 --> 02:59:50,070
Like, they just somehow die!

4259
02:59:50,390 --> 02:59:52,310
If there's anything you can do to help you and your family, name it.

4260
02:59:53,250 --> 02:59:56,030
If it is in my power, it will be done.

4261
02:59:57,630 --> 02:59:58,510
My lord...

4262
02:59:59,710 --> 03:00:03,230
Thank you for having given me the opportunity to serve you.

4263
03:00:03,850 --> 03:00:07,190
It was an honor beyond what my humble talents deserved.

4264
03:00:08,770 --> 03:00:11,690
I wish you luck in your future campaigns.

4265
03:00:15,150 --> 03:00:17,170
Alright, time for the third visit.

4266
03:00:18,550 --> 03:00:20,250
I'll be like, Hey, boo.

4267
03:00:20,510 --> 03:00:21,730
I got rid of the other guy.

4268
03:00:21,970 --> 03:00:23,530
I told you you're the one for me.

4269
03:00:24,050 --> 03:00:24,750
You got learned.

4270
03:00:25,170 --> 03:00:25,750
Oh, it's you.

4271
03:00:26,510 --> 03:00:28,230
I'll be leaving Xinyu soon.

4272
03:00:29,190 --> 03:00:32,410
I wanted to thank you for everything that you've done for me.

4273
03:00:34,470 --> 03:00:35,710
Why are you leaving?

4274
03:00:36,470 --> 03:00:38,590
I can tell you, but no one else.

4275
03:00:38,730 --> 03:00:40,430
Don't worry, it's our dirty little secret.

4276
03:00:40,810 --> 03:00:43,450
A short while ago, I received a message from one of Cao Cao's men.

4277
03:00:44,170 --> 03:00:44,850
It was an invitation to join his council.

4278
03:00:44,850 --> 03:00:46,510
He doesn't need more!

4279
03:00:48,430 --> 03:00:50,230
He's taking the monopoly!

4280
03:00:53,670 --> 03:00:56,850
What do you mean he wants more strategies?

4281
03:00:56,850 --> 03:01:00,550
That first blush, that sounds reassuring, doesn't it?

4282
03:01:00,790 --> 03:01:03,410
But I knew immediately what it really meant.

4283
03:01:03,850 --> 03:01:05,570
She is their hostage.

4284
03:01:06,750 --> 03:01:08,350
The battle of 6k.

4285
03:01:08,550 --> 03:01:10,370
The first two don't count.

4286
03:01:10,870 --> 03:01:12,150
Look, they give us a super chat.

4287
03:01:12,330 --> 03:01:13,470
Thank you, thank you.

4288
03:01:15,430 --> 03:01:18,350
But Lord Liu Bei would have tried to do something to help.

4289
03:01:18,670 --> 03:01:21,990
I can never have too much get poached.

4290
03:01:23,530 --> 03:01:24,530
Roster mania.

4291
03:01:26,850 --> 03:01:27,990
To serve Lord Liu Bei.

4292
03:01:28,510 --> 03:01:31,270
But that, it seems, is an aspiration.

4293
03:01:31,770 --> 03:01:33,810
A dream I must give up.

4294
03:01:35,330 --> 03:01:37,530
Perhaps this is the selfish choice.

4295
03:01:38,050 --> 03:01:40,450
But I agonized over it for days.

4296
03:01:40,910 --> 03:01:45,090
And now that I have made the decision, I cannot regret it.

4297
03:01:45,910 --> 03:01:49,250
Still, I would like to ask you for one last favor.

4298
03:01:50,170 --> 03:01:52,670
Will you look after Lord Liu Bei?

4299
03:01:53,490 --> 03:01:54,690
He is a great man.

4300
03:01:54,990 --> 03:01:57,890
And I truly believe he will unite the land.

4301
03:01:58,130 --> 03:01:59,870
Aw man, that's so sad.

4302
03:02:00,990 --> 03:02:03,050
Why did everyone believe in him?

4303
03:02:05,550 --> 03:02:06,550
Thank you.

4304
03:02:07,090 --> 03:02:09,250
Knowing that is great comfort to me.

4305
03:02:10,110 --> 03:02:13,150
Though my serving Cao Cao may make us enemies on the battlefield.

4306
03:02:13,970 --> 03:02:17,590
In my heart, we will always be friends.

4307
03:02:17,590 --> 03:02:19,330
Everyone wanted to fix him.

4308
03:02:19,330 --> 03:02:22,230
I hope you will continue to follow your true path.

4309
03:02:28,750 --> 03:02:29,230
Alright.

4310
03:02:29,650 --> 03:02:30,990
The third visit!

4311
03:02:31,270 --> 03:02:32,230
The third cutscene!

4312
03:02:33,690 --> 03:02:34,570
This is it.

4313
03:02:34,770 --> 03:02:35,990
We're gonna see my Oshi.

4314
03:02:36,250 --> 03:02:37,970
But he's a little ugly, okay guys?

4315
03:02:38,070 --> 03:02:39,370
I know he doesn't have his mustache.

4316
03:02:39,370 --> 03:02:40,710
So like, don't...

4317
03:02:40,710 --> 03:02:42,310
Don't judge him too hard.

4318
03:02:42,610 --> 03:02:42,970
Okay?

4319
03:02:43,750 --> 03:02:46,090
I'm telling you, I don't like it.

4320
03:02:46,370 --> 03:02:49,170
Why do we have to keep crawling back to him?

4321
03:02:49,870 --> 03:02:54,830
If it's a show of sincerity he wants, we've given him more than he could possibly need.

4322
03:02:55,150 --> 03:02:57,810
It's high time he showed us something in return.

4323
03:02:58,530 --> 03:03:00,130
You can stay here if you like.

4324
03:03:00,450 --> 03:03:02,270
But I am going to his hermitage.

4325
03:03:02,830 --> 03:03:03,930
He just looks wrong.

4326
03:03:04,070 --> 03:03:05,710
No, it's not that like...

4327
03:03:05,710 --> 03:03:06,710
It's like...

4328
03:03:06,710 --> 03:03:08,290
It's like how Liu Bei right now.

4329
03:03:08,430 --> 03:03:09,090
He looks like a...

4330
03:03:09,090 --> 03:03:10,030
A boy...

4331
03:03:10,030 --> 03:03:11,430
He looks like a guy in a...

4332
03:03:11,430 --> 03:03:12,710
Like in a...

4333
03:03:12,710 --> 03:03:13,930
Boy band right now.

4334
03:03:14,150 --> 03:03:15,850
It's just when he doesn't have a mustache.

4335
03:03:15,850 --> 03:03:16,630
It just...

4336
03:03:16,630 --> 03:03:17,430
It looks rye.

4337
03:03:19,270 --> 03:03:19,310
...

4338
03:03:19,310 --> 03:03:23,930
Back then, did you think we were so important that wise men would come running at our call?

4339
03:03:27,530 --> 03:03:33,570
Chishu said that if Lord Chuukoliong truly did not want to meet us, he would have said so the first time we came calling.

4340
03:03:34,050 --> 03:03:36,370
But he hasn't refused us yet, has he?

4341
03:03:36,670 --> 03:03:37,670
He wasn't there.

4342
03:03:51,610 --> 03:03:53,770
Lube is like, I can't go back.

4343
03:03:55,130 --> 03:03:57,010
He understands now.

4344
03:03:57,450 --> 03:03:58,850
He's like, guys, you don't understand.

4345
03:03:59,270 --> 03:04:02,310
We can't keep... I can't go back to Angabunga.

4346
03:04:02,510 --> 03:04:05,810
Guys, we need one brain cell at least.

4347
03:04:07,930 --> 03:04:09,770
He knows now.

4348
03:04:09,830 --> 03:04:11,890
He's got a taste of strategy.

4349
03:04:12,190 --> 03:04:13,730
Now he wants more.

4350
03:04:18,850 --> 03:04:21,170
You are a tenacious visitor.

4351
03:04:21,430 --> 03:04:22,470
I will give you that.

4352
03:04:23,510 --> 03:04:23,950
Alright.

4353
03:04:24,150 --> 03:04:25,610
Don't laugh, okay?

4354
03:04:26,530 --> 03:04:26,810
I...

4355
03:04:30,870 --> 03:04:32,010
Don't worry.

4356
03:04:32,490 --> 03:04:37,190
I will OSH you even when through the hard times.

4357
03:04:38,350 --> 03:04:40,570
Where is the beat?

4358
03:04:41,290 --> 03:04:42,290
Don't worry.

4359
03:04:42,530 --> 03:04:48,210
If you can't love him without the mustache, you don't deserve him.

4360
03:04:49,650 --> 03:04:50,290
Speak plainly.

4361
03:04:50,310 --> 03:04:50,710
Don't worry.

4362
03:04:50,710 --> 03:04:53,030
I'll still be there for you.

4363
03:04:53,490 --> 03:04:55,650
Even your dark times.

4364
03:04:55,650 --> 03:04:58,610
That's enough, Jonfei.

4365
03:04:58,610 --> 03:04:58,910
Fine.

4366
03:04:59,290 --> 03:05:00,850
I'll dispense with the formality.

4367
03:05:01,790 --> 03:05:05,510
We are there for his ups and downs.

4368
03:05:06,650 --> 03:05:10,250
Simply put, I have a mission and you can help me.

4369
03:05:10,710 --> 03:05:12,950
I've staked my life on a great endeavor.

4370
03:05:13,290 --> 03:05:13,530
God.

4371
03:05:13,530 --> 03:05:15,630
And will do anything to see it through.

4372
03:05:15,850 --> 03:05:17,050
But I can't keep by myself.

4373
03:05:17,050 --> 03:05:17,070
I am trying.

4374
03:05:17,430 --> 03:05:18,270
For my OSH.

4375
03:05:18,850 --> 03:05:19,450
In help.

4376
03:05:19,610 --> 03:05:20,450
A great endeavor.

4377
03:05:20,770 --> 03:05:21,850
In sickness and in health.

4378
03:05:22,330 --> 03:05:26,270
I'll build a world where people can live as they wish.

4379
03:05:27,170 --> 03:05:28,030
I see.

4380
03:05:28,330 --> 03:05:30,390
But again, that's not very specific.

4381
03:05:31,170 --> 03:05:35,410
For starters, what does it mean to live as you wish?

4382
03:05:36,190 --> 03:05:38,850
How different would this world of yours be?

4383
03:05:41,390 --> 03:05:44,390
After all, living as you wish isn't that hard.

4384
03:05:45,010 --> 03:05:45,710
Look at me.

4385
03:05:46,330 --> 03:05:48,370
I refuse to serve any man.

4386
03:05:48,610 --> 03:05:49,270
And here I am.

4387
03:05:49,610 --> 03:05:51,610
Living as I please in the mountains.

4388
03:05:52,990 --> 03:05:54,710
But you are the exception.

4389
03:05:55,530 --> 03:05:57,550
The reality is, few people have...

4390
03:05:57,550 --> 03:05:59,090
I think I would have liked him better.

4391
03:05:59,110 --> 03:06:03,010
If he didn't have, like, his attempt of trying to grow a beard.

4392
03:06:03,010 --> 03:06:05,270
Like, I...

4393
03:06:05,270 --> 03:06:07,550
I think if he had, like...

4394
03:06:07,550 --> 03:06:08,810
It's just weird.

4395
03:06:09,090 --> 03:06:09,730
I...

4396
03:06:09,730 --> 03:06:11,390
But I'll be strong for you.

4397
03:06:11,650 --> 03:06:12,070
I...

4398
03:06:12,070 --> 03:06:13,450
I'll be strong.

4399
03:06:13,990 --> 03:06:16,070
If some men live as they please.

4400
03:06:16,170 --> 03:06:17,770
And some men don't.

4401
03:06:18,070 --> 03:06:18,670
Don't worry.

4402
03:06:19,270 --> 03:06:20,290
What is it that divides them?

4403
03:06:20,770 --> 03:06:22,490
I'm strong for you.

4404
03:06:22,950 --> 03:06:25,310
War, chaos, and anarchy keep men from their dreams.

4405
03:06:25,530 --> 03:06:28,230
A trite answer, I know, but true nonetheless.

4406
03:06:29,090 --> 03:06:31,650
Constant war leads to ruin and poverty.

4407
03:06:31,650 --> 03:06:34,970
And poverty narrows a man's world until it is a prison.

4408
03:06:35,490 --> 03:06:39,850
If we can offer a helping hand and lift up those in need.

4409
03:06:40,330 --> 03:06:43,710
It's sure to eventually lead to something better.

4410
03:06:45,210 --> 03:06:45,770
Yaaay!

4411
03:06:46,810 --> 03:06:47,370
Benevolence!

4412
03:06:47,590 --> 03:06:49,230
Surely there's no harm in trying.

4413
03:06:49,930 --> 03:06:53,630
So, you want to put an end to the turmoil across the land.

4414
03:06:54,370 --> 03:06:56,550
Is that your dream, Lord Liu Bei?

4415
03:06:57,450 --> 03:06:58,110
I...

4416
03:06:58,110 --> 03:06:58,970
Ugh...

4417
03:06:58,970 --> 03:06:59,930
I don't know.

4418
03:07:01,070 --> 03:07:02,670
Yes, I suppose so.

4419
03:07:03,550 --> 03:07:05,150
But it's not that simple.

4420
03:07:05,870 --> 03:07:12,770
If peace were merely the absence of turmoil, I could stop fighting Lord Cao Cao today and achieve it.

4421
03:07:16,030 --> 03:07:16,690
Brother...

4422
03:07:16,690 --> 03:07:20,070
But Lord Cao Cao only sees the distant future.

4423
03:07:20,070 --> 03:07:23,470
He doesn't see the destruction that he leaves in his wake.

4424
03:07:24,570 --> 03:07:26,210
You killed too!

4425
03:07:26,610 --> 03:07:29,050
I was in five battles!

4426
03:07:29,810 --> 03:07:31,710
All those lives cut down.

4427
03:07:32,050 --> 03:07:33,830
Sacrifices to his grander vision.

4428
03:07:34,130 --> 03:07:37,330
I see the righteousness of Lord Cao Cao's cause.

4429
03:07:37,550 --> 03:07:39,410
And I understand the sacrifices.

4430
03:07:40,390 --> 03:07:43,430
But even so, I cannot accept them.

4431
03:07:43,430 --> 03:07:44,550
You don't understand.

4432
03:07:45,170 --> 03:07:46,990
He kills for peace, guys.

4433
03:07:47,790 --> 03:07:48,470
Laugh if you want.

4434
03:07:49,310 --> 03:07:50,990
For the good of the people.

4435
03:07:51,410 --> 03:07:53,930
I know that what I'm saying seems like the selfish desires of a child.

4436
03:07:55,070 --> 03:07:55,750
Hmm...

4437
03:07:55,750 --> 03:07:56,610
Maybe so.

4438
03:07:57,370 --> 03:07:58,690
But still...

4439
03:07:59,390 --> 03:08:03,670
If you were determined to achieve such things with your own hands...

4440
03:08:03,670 --> 03:08:05,510
Then I wouldn't call it...

4441
03:08:05,510 --> 03:08:06,670
Selfishness.

4442
03:08:08,310 --> 03:08:09,810
I'd call it...

4443
03:08:09,810 --> 03:08:10,750
Purpose.

4444
03:08:10,750 --> 03:08:12,810
Assumingly, he doesn't Lupe...

4445
03:08:12,810 --> 03:08:14,110
Okay, we don't know that, guys.

4446
03:08:14,350 --> 03:08:17,390
I'm pretty sure at least, like, one army has done that.

4447
03:08:17,830 --> 03:08:20,270
Like, Lupe cannot control all of them.

4448
03:08:20,570 --> 03:08:21,210
He uses the sword to an eternal.

4449
03:08:21,510 --> 03:08:23,870
And the rule of reason to impose peace.

4450
03:08:24,490 --> 03:08:26,350
It's the most obvious path.

4451
03:08:27,130 --> 03:08:28,810
Logical and clear-sighted.

4452
03:08:28,930 --> 03:08:31,130
Oh no, he wants to fix him.

4453
03:08:31,910 --> 03:08:34,550
But inevitably, it demands many sacrifices.

4454
03:08:35,250 --> 03:08:36,530
See, I told you.

4455
03:08:36,650 --> 03:08:38,510
Everyone just wants to fix him.

4456
03:08:38,510 --> 03:08:40,410
The way is the way of a king.

4457
03:08:41,290 --> 03:08:45,590
You put the people first, and refuse to abandon anyone along the way.

4458
03:08:46,810 --> 03:08:48,970
But it is also foolishness.

4459
03:08:49,470 --> 03:08:52,990
A fantasy woven out of clouds and good intentions.

4460
03:08:54,210 --> 03:08:56,290
No wonder you don't know how to go about it.

4461
03:08:57,810 --> 03:09:00,450
Let him brew with me.

4462
03:09:00,790 --> 03:09:01,090
Yes.

4463
03:09:01,090 --> 03:09:01,870
How can I make your reality?

4464
03:09:03,530 --> 03:09:03,670
How?

4465
03:09:04,550 --> 03:09:07,730
By bringing the entire land under your rule.

4466
03:09:08,510 --> 03:09:12,730
Then, and only then, can you shape it into the world you desire.

4467
03:09:14,810 --> 03:09:16,910
And... how do I do that?

4468
03:09:18,070 --> 03:09:19,090
The Long Zong plan.

4469
03:09:19,690 --> 03:09:21,210
Divide and conquer.

4470
03:09:22,270 --> 03:09:22,810
Divide and conquer.

4471
03:09:22,810 --> 03:09:23,210
Drive South South.

4472
03:09:23,210 --> 03:09:23,770
Divide and conquer.

4473
03:09:24,370 --> 03:09:24,550
Risk.

4474
03:09:25,190 --> 03:09:26,970
And make this a three-sided war.

4475
03:09:28,350 --> 03:09:29,230
Three kingdoms!

4476
03:09:30,110 --> 03:09:30,630
I will show you how...

4477
03:09:30,630 --> 03:09:30,730
Three kingdoms!

4478
03:09:33,740 --> 03:09:34,540
Iffy!

4479
03:09:37,480 --> 03:09:39,860
And that's how the three kingdoms can be!

4480
03:09:43,060 --> 03:09:44,320
Where's Lord Liu Bei?

4481
03:09:44,620 --> 03:09:46,660
Is he with Lord Juga Liang again?

4482
03:09:47,440 --> 03:09:47,780
Yes.

4483
03:09:48,300 --> 03:09:51,000
Ever since he brought Lord Chu Gu Liang back here.

4484
03:09:51,460 --> 03:09:52,740
They've been holed up together.

4485
03:09:53,280 --> 03:09:54,520
Talking day and night.

4486
03:09:54,700 --> 03:09:57,660
Okay, Guan Yu is definitely not, not Asian voice actor.

4487
03:09:58,180 --> 03:09:58,500
For sure.

4488
03:09:58,760 --> 03:09:59,520
He finally found water.

4489
03:10:00,360 --> 03:10:02,940
All his vague ideas for a better world.

4490
03:10:03,240 --> 03:10:05,440
Are being hammered into solid plans.

4491
03:10:06,320 --> 03:10:08,760
I don't think I've ever seen our brother look happier.

4492
03:10:09,520 --> 03:10:10,640
That's all well...

4493
03:10:10,640 --> 03:10:11,780
That's a new one, yeah.

4494
03:10:12,180 --> 03:10:14,320
What exactly are they talking about every day?

4495
03:10:15,280 --> 03:10:16,440
Nah, I don't like it.

4496
03:10:16,980 --> 03:10:17,880
Not one bit.

4497
03:10:18,120 --> 03:10:20,080
Alright, you know the best part about being a doughkeeper?

4498
03:10:20,360 --> 03:10:22,100
Nobody butchers my name anymore.

4499
03:10:22,700 --> 03:10:23,100
That's...

4500
03:10:23,520 --> 03:10:24,880
I'm not sure I like it either.

4501
03:10:25,360 --> 03:10:27,180
But as much as we'd like to...

4502
03:10:27,640 --> 03:10:28,280
You cannot help us.

4503
03:10:28,920 --> 03:10:30,800
We're doing more than we can have.

4504
03:10:31,480 --> 03:10:35,300
We don't know what advice this Lord Chu Gu Liang is giving our brother.

4505
03:10:35,540 --> 03:10:37,240
Or what plans they're hatching.

4506
03:10:37,240 --> 03:10:39,560
All we can do is watch and wait.

4507
03:10:51,920 --> 03:10:53,260
I remember Ximie.

4508
03:10:53,520 --> 03:10:56,500
And how Lord Xu Su seemed to control the battle at will.

4509
03:10:56,940 --> 03:10:58,500
I've never seen anything like it.

4510
03:10:59,840 --> 03:11:05,120
Now if a man as smart as him says Lord Chu Gu Liang is even better, then who am I to deny it?

4511
03:11:05,760 --> 03:11:08,640
Our army had everything but the sharp-minded council needed to guide us.

4512
03:11:09,220 --> 03:11:15,620
If Lord Liu Bei has found the missing piece in this military strategist, there'll be nothing to stop him from achieving the unmagical...

4513
03:11:15,620 --> 03:11:17,760
Oh my god, we're actually using our brains now.

4514
03:11:18,360 --> 03:11:19,320
I agree.

4515
03:11:20,180 --> 03:11:20,880
I thought you would.

4516
03:11:22,100 --> 03:11:26,200
They say that one great strategist is worth 10 million men on the battlefield.

4517
03:11:26,400 --> 03:11:28,680
Yeah, and Cao Cao has like 20 of them.

4518
03:11:28,860 --> 03:11:33,120
Even as a humble warrior, it will be a thrill to fight under a military...

4519
03:11:33,120 --> 03:11:34,420
We have a brain!

4520
03:11:35,880 --> 03:11:38,140
How will Lord Xu Ga Liang use me?

4521
03:11:38,440 --> 03:11:39,720
What will my role be?

4522
03:11:40,300 --> 03:11:42,000
I can't wait to find out.

4523
03:11:50,220 --> 03:11:51,540
I told you guys, right?

4524
03:11:51,660 --> 03:11:52,160
The story?

4525
03:11:53,280 --> 03:11:54,140
Before then?

4526
03:11:54,740 --> 03:11:55,920
Oh my god, no.

4527
03:11:56,880 --> 03:11:57,340
No!

4528
03:11:57,880 --> 03:11:58,760
She's back!

4529
03:11:59,340 --> 03:11:59,840
No!

4530
03:11:59,840 --> 03:12:00,360
No!

4531
03:12:00,360 --> 03:12:00,780
It's you!

4532
03:12:01,980 --> 03:12:03,380
How long has it been?

4533
03:12:04,560 --> 03:12:04,980
No!

4534
03:12:05,720 --> 03:12:08,420
Are you not satisfied with the doll?

4535
03:12:09,140 --> 03:12:10,340
No way!

4536
03:12:13,040 --> 03:12:14,080
No way!

4537
03:12:14,860 --> 03:12:15,580
Wait, that's good.

4538
03:12:15,720 --> 03:12:16,460
I like that answer.

4539
03:12:16,460 --> 03:12:16,840
You see me?

4540
03:12:18,060 --> 03:12:19,020
We studied well.

4541
03:12:19,140 --> 03:12:21,480
I heard you I'd become a vassal of Lord Liu Bei.

4542
03:12:21,960 --> 03:12:25,060
So I thought I'd take the opportunity to come see you again.

4543
03:12:26,600 --> 03:12:30,040
The fact is, I recently entered Lord Liu Bei's service myself.

4544
03:12:30,260 --> 03:12:30,560
Wait, what?

4545
03:12:30,900 --> 03:12:32,080
Which makes us allies and comrades.

4546
03:12:32,500 --> 03:12:33,640
How did you get in here?

4547
03:12:35,320 --> 03:12:36,320
Oh, no.

4548
03:12:36,860 --> 03:12:38,440
Did she marry him already?

4549
03:12:38,440 --> 03:12:39,560
No!

4550
03:12:43,600 --> 03:12:44,200
No!

4551
03:12:44,720 --> 03:12:45,980
She married him!

4552
03:12:46,480 --> 03:12:47,080
No!

4553
03:12:48,020 --> 03:12:49,320
How did that happen?

4554
03:12:49,600 --> 03:12:49,900
You see.

4555
03:12:53,380 --> 03:12:55,600
Lord Shuga Liang wishes to speak with you.

4556
03:12:56,060 --> 03:13:00,260
He wants to talk to you about plans for the next battle.

4557
03:13:01,160 --> 03:13:06,100
We have sent out scouts, but so far there have been no reports of any approaching armies.

4558
03:13:06,420 --> 03:13:07,480
I'm so sad.

4559
03:13:09,480 --> 03:13:10,880
He saw the doll.

4560
03:13:11,200 --> 03:13:13,360
I hope he doesn't think other reasons.

4561
03:13:19,980 --> 03:13:22,120
I hope he didn't see the doll, guys.

4562
03:13:23,000 --> 03:13:25,620
I don't want there to be any misunderstandings.

4563
03:13:26,900 --> 03:13:28,260
Anton, thank you for the super chat.

4564
03:13:28,380 --> 03:13:29,240
Thank you, thank you.

4565
03:13:29,420 --> 03:13:33,080
I'm convinced that the kingdom shattered into three because everyone was such a freak.

4566
03:13:33,320 --> 03:13:35,820
I have not read a thousand year old romance.

4567
03:13:35,820 --> 03:13:37,340
Thank you for the super chat.

4568
03:13:37,460 --> 03:13:38,340
Thank you, thank you.

4569
03:13:39,120 --> 03:13:39,640
Whoa!

4570
03:13:40,120 --> 03:13:40,620
Hold on!

4571
03:13:40,800 --> 03:13:41,720
Slow down there!

4572
03:13:42,340 --> 03:13:43,980
Uh, what's this next battle?

4573
03:13:44,200 --> 03:13:45,340
Who's gonna be attacking?

4574
03:13:45,640 --> 03:13:46,360
And when?

4575
03:13:47,140 --> 03:13:47,560
Hmm.

4576
03:13:48,280 --> 03:13:48,840
Huh.

4577
03:13:49,220 --> 03:13:49,740
Forgive me.

4578
03:13:49,980 --> 03:13:51,940
I left out some key information.

4579
03:13:52,900 --> 03:13:55,400
Cao Cao's forces will soon march against us.

4580
03:13:56,920 --> 03:13:59,660
But we routed Cao Cao's army some time ago.

4581
03:13:59,940 --> 03:14:02,500
And we haven't seen any sign of attack from them since.

4582
03:14:04,580 --> 03:14:06,600
What makes you think they're coming now?

4583
03:14:08,600 --> 03:14:08,960
Huh.

4584
03:14:09,260 --> 03:14:12,300
Me, my wife, and her wooden doll of an unnamed hero.

4585
03:14:13,700 --> 03:14:15,120
Giga, thank you for the super chat.

4586
03:14:15,300 --> 03:14:16,160
Thank you, thank you.

4587
03:14:16,300 --> 03:14:16,920
It's inevitable.

4588
03:14:16,920 --> 03:14:19,600
He is his natural enemy.

4589
03:14:20,740 --> 03:14:24,040
Being fought off once will not be enough to break their spirit.

4590
03:14:24,680 --> 03:14:26,540
They will come again for the kill.

4591
03:14:26,960 --> 03:14:29,200
So long as the opportunity remains.

4592
03:14:32,300 --> 03:14:40,580
Taking into account their losses in the last battle, I believe they should be more or less ready to make their move.

4593
03:14:42,700 --> 03:14:43,700
Are you sure?

4594
03:14:44,160 --> 03:14:46,380
That would be remarkably persistent of them.

4595
03:14:47,180 --> 03:14:48,240
I doubt they'll give up.

4596
03:14:49,060 --> 03:14:51,780
Not until you kneel before Cao Cao.

4597
03:14:53,700 --> 03:14:59,800
They've eliminated the remnants of Yuan Shao's forces, and the situation in Hubei has stabilized.

4598
03:15:00,560 --> 03:15:02,960
There is little reason for them to hold back.

4599
03:15:03,920 --> 03:15:04,180
Hmm.

4600
03:15:04,760 --> 03:15:09,320
So Lord Chu Gu Leon, how might we defeat Cao Cao's forces?

4601
03:15:09,320 --> 03:15:13,880
We establish a position at Boangpo to defend against the enemy.

4602
03:15:14,560 --> 03:15:17,980
It is complex terrain with natural obstacles.

4603
03:15:18,540 --> 03:15:22,720
Perfect for fire traps and ambushes to confuse their advance.

4604
03:15:23,760 --> 03:15:24,400
Traps?

4605
03:15:24,580 --> 03:15:26,180
Those are for pussies!

4606
03:15:28,160 --> 03:15:30,040
It is hard to believe a trick...

4607
03:15:30,040 --> 03:15:30,460
A trick!

4608
03:15:33,060 --> 03:15:35,020
Well, I'm interested.

4609
03:15:35,340 --> 03:15:39,300
Let's see how far our master strategist can turn things around for us.

4610
03:15:40,140 --> 03:15:40,660
Agreed.

4611
03:15:41,120 --> 03:15:44,160
By the way, I was wondering about something.

4612
03:15:45,140 --> 03:15:45,980
Who are you?

4613
03:15:46,600 --> 03:15:47,680
This is plus one.

4614
03:15:48,200 --> 03:15:49,700
Forgive me for the lack of introduction.

4615
03:15:49,960 --> 03:15:49,980
No!

4616
03:15:50,560 --> 03:15:51,520
This is my wife.

4617
03:15:51,880 --> 03:15:52,400
No!

4618
03:15:53,800 --> 03:15:53,860
What?

4619
03:15:54,800 --> 03:15:56,400
It is a pleasure to meet you.

4620
03:15:56,620 --> 03:16:00,200
I will be serving Lord Liu Bei alongside my husband.

4621
03:16:00,200 --> 03:16:00,720
No!

4622
03:16:01,820 --> 03:16:02,000
No!

4623
03:16:05,800 --> 03:16:07,500
He's not single!

4624
03:16:08,340 --> 03:16:09,260
Guys!

4625
03:16:10,280 --> 03:16:11,340
It's okay.

4626
03:16:12,560 --> 03:16:14,400
Liu Bu wasn't single either.

4627
03:16:15,100 --> 03:16:16,520
But we got in.

4628
03:16:17,120 --> 03:16:17,680
We can do it again.

4629
03:16:18,200 --> 03:16:18,940
We did.

4630
03:16:19,800 --> 03:16:21,660
We can do it again.

4631
03:16:21,680 --> 03:16:22,440
Come to think of the lady you will be here when we heard.

4632
03:16:23,840 --> 03:16:26,160
The pleasure is ours, Lady Yue Ying.

4633
03:16:27,100 --> 03:16:27,600
Zhao Yun.

4634
03:16:27,920 --> 03:16:29,220
You're okay with this?

4635
03:16:30,580 --> 03:16:31,140
Hey!

4636
03:16:31,440 --> 03:16:33,780
I know you've got something to say about all this.

4637
03:16:34,260 --> 03:16:34,860
Don't you?

4638
03:16:36,820 --> 03:16:37,660
Sorry.

4639
03:16:38,060 --> 03:16:40,760
After finding out that she's his wife now.

4640
03:16:41,700 --> 03:16:43,060
I'm sad.

4641
03:16:46,140 --> 03:16:47,640
Not really.

4642
03:16:48,580 --> 03:16:53,840
I will do whatever I can to assist my husband and everyone here.

4643
03:16:54,720 --> 03:16:56,200
We appreciate it.

4644
03:16:56,740 --> 03:17:01,200
I, for one, am glad to have another ally we can depend upon.

4645
03:17:04,610 --> 03:17:07,410
Okay, but like, she has my doll.

4646
03:17:07,750 --> 03:17:09,390
So like, he knows!

4647
03:17:09,770 --> 03:17:10,530
He knows!

4648
03:17:12,230 --> 03:17:13,210
He knows!

4649
03:17:15,170 --> 03:17:17,790
He hasn't said anything about it!

4650
03:17:19,770 --> 03:17:21,210
Alright, let's see.

4651
03:17:21,670 --> 03:17:24,270
I don't know what objectives I have to do anyway.

4652
03:17:25,650 --> 03:17:27,970
Is there anyone that I've really needed?

4653
03:17:28,190 --> 03:17:28,710
Not really.

4654
03:17:28,910 --> 03:17:29,890
Okay, I wanna...

4655
03:17:29,890 --> 03:17:30,550
Let's see.

4656
03:17:30,870 --> 03:17:32,990
Let's see if there's any, like, really...

4657
03:17:35,710 --> 03:17:37,290
Is there a better weapon?

4658
03:17:37,870 --> 03:17:39,610
Or is that the best one?

4659
03:17:40,050 --> 03:17:41,110
I just wanna be sure.

4660
03:17:41,530 --> 03:17:42,850
Yeah, that is the best one.

4661
03:17:43,270 --> 03:17:43,870
Alright, oh yeah.

4662
03:17:44,030 --> 03:17:44,530
So that's how...

4663
03:17:44,530 --> 03:17:45,410
I told you guys this, right?

4664
03:17:45,530 --> 03:17:46,930
For like, my name?

4665
03:17:47,350 --> 03:17:48,150
Back then?

4666
03:17:48,930 --> 03:17:51,070
I wanted to be called something else.

4667
03:17:53,530 --> 03:17:54,170
Because...

4668
03:17:54,170 --> 03:17:57,050
When they gave me that name, I...

4669
03:17:57,050 --> 03:17:57,410
My...

4670
03:17:57,410 --> 03:17:59,230
My literally number one complaint...

4671
03:17:59,790 --> 03:18:00,850
Was that...

4672
03:18:00,850 --> 03:18:03,410
People are not gonna be able to pronounce it correctly.

4673
03:18:03,930 --> 03:18:05,090
And then...

4674
03:18:05,090 --> 03:18:06,490
But they were like...

4675
03:18:06,490 --> 03:18:07,130
Oh!

4676
03:18:07,610 --> 03:18:08,250
But...

4677
03:18:08,250 --> 03:18:10,770
This name we give you...

4678
03:18:10,770 --> 03:18:12,670
It has zero Google searches.

4679
03:18:12,990 --> 03:18:14,310
So it'll be good for discoverability.

4680
03:18:15,410 --> 03:18:17,270
So I was like...

4681
03:18:17,270 --> 03:18:18,310
I had to be...

4682
03:18:18,310 --> 03:18:19,850
I had to have that name.

4683
03:18:20,010 --> 03:18:20,530
I was like...

4684
03:18:20,530 --> 03:18:21,750
Can I be this name?

4685
03:18:21,930 --> 03:18:23,570
So it's easier to pronounce?

4686
03:18:24,070 --> 03:18:25,150
And they're like...

4687
03:18:25,150 --> 03:18:25,530
No.

4688
03:18:38,900 --> 03:18:39,820
Shall we start?

4689
03:18:42,280 --> 03:18:42,800
Alright.

4690
03:18:43,220 --> 03:18:43,800
Let's go.

4691
03:18:44,060 --> 03:18:47,820
We are now blessed with the presence of the sleeping dragon himself.

4692
03:18:48,320 --> 03:18:49,720
I think...

4693
03:18:49,720 --> 03:18:52,500
Guys, I wouldn't have picked a name that I couldn't pronounce.

4694
03:18:52,500 --> 03:18:53,020
Guys.

4695
03:18:57,780 --> 03:18:58,820
Next scene.

4696
03:18:58,960 --> 03:19:00,420
Thank you for the super chat.

4697
03:19:00,920 --> 03:19:01,280
Thank you.

4698
03:19:01,480 --> 03:19:02,240
Thank you.

4699
03:19:02,580 --> 03:19:05,980
You were one of those people who couldn't pronounce it.

4700
03:19:07,620 --> 03:19:10,060
Welcome to the tomato farm.

4701
03:19:10,360 --> 03:19:10,660
Welcome.

4702
03:19:11,200 --> 03:19:11,560
Welcome.

4703
03:19:11,560 --> 03:19:11,700
Welcome.

4704
03:19:12,320 --> 03:19:13,740
Ha ha ha ha ha.

4705
03:19:14,140 --> 03:19:14,980
Ha ha ha ha.

4706
03:19:18,100 --> 03:19:18,680
Ha ha ha.

4707
03:19:19,020 --> 03:19:19,400
Ha ha ha.

4708
03:19:19,400 --> 03:19:23,000
I think Chikwotlan should be the one to lead this meeting.

4709
03:19:23,620 --> 03:19:24,240
Ha ha ha.

4710
03:19:24,680 --> 03:19:25,180
Ha ha ha.

4711
03:19:25,180 --> 03:19:25,240
Ha ha ha.

4712
03:19:28,300 --> 03:19:29,940
As you wish, Lord Lupe.

4713
03:19:30,640 --> 03:19:31,180
Now...

4714
03:19:31,180 --> 03:19:33,670
Allow me to start by explaining our situation.

4715
03:19:34,510 --> 03:19:36,770
Chow Chow has wiped out the House of Yuan.

4716
03:19:37,010 --> 03:19:39,930
And his large army has closed in on Jin Province.

4717
03:19:40,710 --> 03:19:41,270
Ha ha ha.

4718
03:19:41,450 --> 03:19:45,270
To confront this threat, we have positioned our forces in Bo Heng Po.

4719
03:19:46,450 --> 03:19:49,990
They are led by Chow Chow Dun, one of Chow Chow's most trusted generals.

4720
03:19:50,670 --> 03:19:52,970
Defeating him will rob them of their commander.

4721
03:19:53,110 --> 03:19:54,770
And they will surely flee.

4722
03:19:55,590 --> 03:19:58,530
Conversely, if we lose Lord Lupe, we will suffer the same fate.

4723
03:19:59,210 --> 03:20:02,350
We must do all our power to protect him in this battle.

4724
03:20:03,790 --> 03:20:10,510
Now that I have explained the situation, I will lay out our plan for engaging Chow Chow's forces.

4725
03:20:10,970 --> 03:20:13,570
The conditions of this battle are clearly not in our favor.

4726
03:20:13,830 --> 03:20:16,970
We are numbered and our formation leaves much to be desired.

4727
03:20:17,510 --> 03:20:18,030
What?

4728
03:20:18,230 --> 03:20:20,930
You chose this battlefield and our formation?

4729
03:20:21,270 --> 03:20:23,570
Now you're saying we're at a disadvantage?

4730
03:20:26,770 --> 03:20:28,150
Patience, Zhang Fei.

4731
03:20:28,930 --> 03:20:31,010
Lord Zhugot Lun isn't finished.

4732
03:20:31,890 --> 03:20:33,630
I understand your concern.

4733
03:20:34,030 --> 03:20:36,390
Our disadvantage is playing the C.

4734
03:20:36,830 --> 03:20:40,910
But that is precisely what makes our plans so unpredictable.

4735
03:20:42,350 --> 03:20:47,010
Now, the enemy's main force is concentrated in the center of the battlefield.

4736
03:20:47,210 --> 03:20:49,750
We eliminate them all in one final swoop.

4737
03:20:50,270 --> 03:20:51,450
Fire should do the trick.

4738
03:20:51,710 --> 03:20:56,170
After we let their momentum bring them into range, we unleash a fire attack.

4739
03:20:56,410 --> 03:21:01,250
To do this, we must hold strong against their assault long enough for the chance to present itself.

4740
03:21:01,570 --> 03:21:03,690
When it's time, our forces will pull back.

4741
03:21:04,430 --> 03:21:10,390
Lord Zhou Khan and Yunying will keep the enemy at bay in the north itself.

4742
03:21:10,610 --> 03:21:13,690
And Lord Zhao Yun should be the one to lead our central forces.

4743
03:21:14,210 --> 03:21:15,090
Lead it to me.

4744
03:21:15,090 --> 03:21:19,470
I'll run right around the outside of the battlefield and hit them from behind.

4745
03:21:20,310 --> 03:21:21,670
I'll lead our archers.

4746
03:21:21,810 --> 03:21:24,650
We can suppress their advance with volleys from high ground.

4747
03:21:25,330 --> 03:21:29,850
The task before me may be difficult, but it's also an opportunity to prove my worth.

4748
03:21:30,050 --> 03:21:31,750
I'll not fail you in this fight.

4749
03:21:32,530 --> 03:21:38,610
While our forces are holding off the enemy advance, we need Lord Guan Yun and Zhang Fei to prepare the fire attack.

4750
03:21:39,970 --> 03:21:40,430
Uh...

4751
03:21:40,430 --> 03:21:43,230
Guan Yun should go north and capture the base in the mountains.

4752
03:21:43,850 --> 03:21:46,370
Zhang Fei will head south to take the forest base there.

4753
03:21:47,110 --> 03:21:48,890
Wait, then... Wait, are they not coming with me?

4754
03:21:50,610 --> 03:21:52,730
Lord Zhao Yun will pull his forces back.

4755
03:21:52,970 --> 03:21:57,670
And when the enemy's front line moves forward in pursuit, we'll launch fire arrows from each base.

4756
03:21:58,050 --> 03:21:59,570
This is really complicated.

4757
03:21:59,890 --> 03:22:02,270
I missed my Ungabunga strategy.

4758
03:22:02,950 --> 03:22:03,410
I...

4759
03:22:07,750 --> 03:22:10,650
Yes, I'm just just going straight in.

4760
03:22:13,530 --> 03:22:18,490
Their truce will be engulfed in flames and lose their will to fight.

4761
03:22:18,890 --> 03:22:20,630
This is when we turn the tide.

4762
03:22:21,770 --> 03:22:25,110
Your long, fancy speech hasn't convinced me that any of this is going...

4763
03:22:25,110 --> 03:22:26,390
Oh, I'm Zhang Fei right now.

4764
03:22:26,530 --> 03:22:27,190
That's bad.

4765
03:22:27,190 --> 03:22:28,990
If I'm Zhang Fei, that's really bad.

4766
03:22:29,330 --> 03:22:29,770
I...

4767
03:22:30,550 --> 03:22:32,170
If I'm thinking like him.

4768
03:22:33,070 --> 03:22:35,010
I've placed my trust in the wisdom of our strategist.

4769
03:22:35,910 --> 03:22:38,990
If you believe me, please do what you can to help Zhugut learn.

4770
03:22:41,630 --> 03:22:43,530
Damn it, that's not fair, brother.

4771
03:22:43,770 --> 03:22:46,310
When you put it that way, I guess I have no choice.

4772
03:22:47,410 --> 03:22:49,430
I'm counting on the rest of you as well.

4773
03:22:49,670 --> 03:22:53,110
We'll carry out Zhugut learn's plan and claim victory in Bo Wen Po.

4774
03:22:54,310 --> 03:22:54,710
Alright.

4775
03:22:55,110 --> 03:22:56,910
Wait, I know I can go pick Guanyu.

4776
03:22:56,970 --> 03:22:58,270
Wait, where was he supposed to go?

4777
03:22:59,270 --> 03:22:59,750
Guys.

4778
03:23:00,210 --> 03:23:01,470
I already forgot.

4779
03:23:01,970 --> 03:23:04,150
Where was he supposed to go, guys?

4780
03:23:05,570 --> 03:23:06,750
Oh, this is bad.

4781
03:23:06,750 --> 03:23:07,690
I don't remember.

4782
03:23:07,930 --> 03:23:09,870
Okay, I still did not like the battle cry.

4783
03:23:09,870 --> 03:23:12,510
That shit takes too long to process.

4784
03:23:15,550 --> 03:23:17,210
Let's grab something else.

4785
03:23:17,910 --> 03:23:18,690
A spirit wave.

4786
03:23:19,550 --> 03:23:21,090
Okay, we'll grab spirit wave.

4787
03:23:23,010 --> 03:23:24,170
Alright, he did...

4788
03:23:24,170 --> 03:23:26,350
He talked so much that I already forgot which way.

4789
03:23:27,490 --> 03:23:28,370
North base.

4790
03:23:28,610 --> 03:23:29,530
Okay, north base.

4791
03:23:29,870 --> 03:23:33,310
But yeah, I thought it was funny, like a little piece of lore.

4792
03:23:34,230 --> 03:23:35,790
Because people thought...

4793
03:23:35,790 --> 03:23:36,430
They're like...

4794
03:23:36,430 --> 03:23:39,390
Why did she pick that name if she can't even pronounce it?

4795
03:23:39,490 --> 03:23:40,510
I didn't.

4796
03:23:40,670 --> 03:23:41,090
Like...

4797
03:23:42,210 --> 03:23:44,310
My complaint was that...

4798
03:23:44,850 --> 03:23:46,110
Nobody could pronounce...

4799
03:23:46,110 --> 03:23:48,190
I knew no one could pronounce that name.

4800
03:23:48,610 --> 03:23:49,010
I...

4801
03:23:50,010 --> 03:23:51,610
I was always like...

4802
03:23:51,990 --> 03:23:57,190
Every time I met somebody new, no one could pronounce that name correctly.

4803
03:23:57,190 --> 03:24:01,690
I had so many different mispronunciations of that name.

4804
03:24:01,830 --> 03:24:04,670
Because no one could pronounce it correctly.

4805
03:24:05,510 --> 03:24:06,230
Like...

4806
03:24:07,710 --> 03:24:08,430
Like...

4807
03:24:08,430 --> 03:24:14,270
You could nearly make a clip of the amount of times people have mispronounced it.

4808
03:24:16,930 --> 03:24:21,010
Every time I met someone new, it was different every time.

4809
03:24:22,130 --> 03:24:25,290
Our central forces will block the enemy advance.

4810
03:24:26,530 --> 03:24:27,010
Meanwhile...

4811
03:24:27,010 --> 03:24:27,870
Okay, where was that?

4812
03:24:27,910 --> 03:24:29,150
That's the base up top, right?

4813
03:24:32,650 --> 03:24:35,450
It was really funny, though.

4814
03:24:36,870 --> 03:24:37,670
It was...

4815
03:24:37,670 --> 03:24:39,370
I would admit, it was funny.

4816
03:24:44,190 --> 03:24:48,150
Yeah, I know which base it is.

4817
03:24:48,310 --> 03:24:49,730
Don't worry, I figured it out.

4818
03:24:50,770 --> 03:24:51,730
Jesus Christ!

4819
03:24:55,490 --> 03:24:56,090
Where...

4820
03:24:56,090 --> 03:24:57,090
Where is that boss?

4821
03:24:57,430 --> 03:24:58,590
Just as Lord Chuguliong said.

4822
03:24:59,110 --> 03:25:01,390
Archers, let your arrows fill the sky.

4823
03:25:02,670 --> 03:25:03,910
Oh my god!

4824
03:25:04,170 --> 03:25:05,130
They're so strong!

4825
03:25:06,970 --> 03:25:09,050
Don't expect an ambush here.

4826
03:25:09,230 --> 03:25:12,050
It won't last long with these arrows raining down on us.

4827
03:25:13,790 --> 03:25:14,390
Bro!

4828
03:25:14,710 --> 03:25:15,890
Just let me hit you!

4829
03:25:16,450 --> 03:25:17,250
Do not waste!

4830
03:25:17,910 --> 03:25:18,870
Oh my...

4831
03:25:18,870 --> 03:25:19,830
Let me hit you!

4832
03:25:20,950 --> 03:25:21,990
Let's march!

4833
03:25:24,630 --> 03:25:25,770
With all my might...

4834
03:25:25,770 --> 03:25:26,060
With all my might...

4835
03:25:27,910 --> 03:25:28,490
Oh!

4836
03:25:30,990 --> 03:25:31,090
No!

4837
03:25:36,930 --> 03:25:37,130
Okay.

4838
03:25:37,490 --> 03:25:38,170
That's fine.

4839
03:25:39,450 --> 03:25:40,590
Jesus Christ.

4840
03:25:40,790 --> 03:25:41,290
It was so...

4841
03:25:41,290 --> 03:25:41,990
Oh my god!

4842
03:25:42,090 --> 03:25:43,330
He has so much HP!

4843
03:25:46,390 --> 03:25:46,990
Heeeeh!

4844
03:25:47,210 --> 03:25:47,690
Whoah!

4845
03:25:47,950 --> 03:25:49,690
Why do you have so much HP?

4846
03:25:50,150 --> 03:25:50,730
Heeeeh!

4847
03:25:51,430 --> 03:25:52,030
Heeeeh!

4848
03:25:54,010 --> 03:25:56,270
I'm just trying to get past this area!

4849
03:25:56,870 --> 03:25:57,810
Not so dead poor.

4850
03:25:57,950 --> 03:25:59,010
Thank you for the super chat.

4851
03:25:59,350 --> 03:26:00,010
How's this?

4852
03:26:00,670 --> 03:26:01,850
Oh, table's turned.

4853
03:26:05,610 --> 03:26:07,350
Alright, get over here.

4854
03:26:12,570 --> 03:26:13,050
Nice.

4855
03:26:14,190 --> 03:26:16,530
Oh, thank god I had that saved up.

4856
03:26:17,210 --> 03:26:19,570
I'm just saving up my thing, just in case.

4857
03:26:25,490 --> 03:26:26,690
Okay, nice.

4858
03:26:26,850 --> 03:26:29,350
He's almost dead, so I can rush up to that north base, too.

4859
03:26:35,450 --> 03:26:35,930
Please!

4860
03:26:37,330 --> 03:26:37,810
Die!

4861
03:26:39,010 --> 03:26:39,770
Here we go.

4862
03:26:40,790 --> 03:26:41,270
Nice.

4863
03:26:41,530 --> 03:26:46,190
Alright, now we can do the thing you were supposed to do, Guanyin, before I kidnapped you.

4864
03:26:48,110 --> 03:26:51,390
Okay, let's do your thing that you were supposed to do, like, 20 years ago.

4865
03:26:56,730 --> 03:26:59,090
Oh no, Jonfei has already got the base.

4866
03:26:59,230 --> 03:26:59,450
Whoops.

4867
03:27:03,250 --> 03:27:03,990
Oh no.

4868
03:27:05,350 --> 03:27:06,230
Begin the advance.

4869
03:27:06,630 --> 03:27:07,350
Oh no!

4870
03:27:07,790 --> 03:27:08,190
No!

4871
03:27:08,430 --> 03:27:09,970
We were supposed to get this base earlier!

4872
03:27:10,510 --> 03:27:12,630
We have to capture the base in the forest.

4873
03:27:13,050 --> 03:27:13,550
Bring him down.

4874
03:27:14,150 --> 03:27:17,030
All of this is a bit too precise for my liking.

4875
03:27:18,130 --> 03:27:18,930
Move forward!

4876
03:27:20,570 --> 03:27:20,970
Okay.

4877
03:27:21,470 --> 03:27:22,250
There we go, there we go.

4878
03:27:22,310 --> 03:27:23,110
There, I got it, I got it.

4879
03:27:23,250 --> 03:27:24,110
Oh wait, I didn't get it yet.

4880
03:27:24,550 --> 03:27:25,830
Don't worry, we're almost got it.

4881
03:27:26,590 --> 03:27:27,930
And do my part!

4882
03:27:28,850 --> 03:27:30,370
Oh wait, I'll get the duel.

4883
03:27:30,610 --> 03:27:31,870
I accept your challenge.

4884
03:27:32,050 --> 03:27:33,490
I'll show no mercy.

4885
03:27:35,010 --> 03:27:36,530
Wait, did I got the wrong base?

4886
03:27:37,110 --> 03:27:37,910
Oh no.

4887
03:27:41,410 --> 03:27:42,210
Oh no.

4888
03:27:43,250 --> 03:27:44,330
Oh my god!

4889
03:27:50,410 --> 03:27:50,930
What?!

4890
03:27:51,610 --> 03:27:53,450
Oh my god, this guy is so good.

4891
03:27:53,450 --> 03:27:53,590
Easy.

4892
03:27:54,750 --> 03:27:55,110
Easy.

4893
03:27:56,010 --> 03:27:56,370
Easy.

4894
03:27:56,690 --> 03:27:57,050
Easy.

4895
03:28:01,430 --> 03:28:02,610
Oh, no wait, I got it!

4896
03:28:02,690 --> 03:28:03,170
I got the block!

4897
03:28:06,470 --> 03:28:07,070
There you go.

4898
03:28:07,330 --> 03:28:07,790
This should be it.

4899
03:28:10,150 --> 03:28:10,890
This should be it!

4900
03:28:15,250 --> 03:28:23,350
This should be it!

4901
03:28:23,350 --> 03:28:24,170
Which...

4902
03:28:26,050 --> 03:28:28,330
Which base was I supposed to take?

4903
03:28:28,850 --> 03:28:30,570
I got the right one, right?

4904
03:28:30,870 --> 03:28:32,570
Or is it the one in the top right?

4905
03:28:34,730 --> 03:28:36,390
Guys, I was not listening.

4906
03:28:36,810 --> 03:28:38,370
Which base was I supposed...

4907
03:28:39,270 --> 03:28:41,590
Oh my god, I got the wrong base.

4908
03:28:41,930 --> 03:28:43,170
Oh my god.

4909
03:28:43,490 --> 03:28:44,950
I'm so sorry.

4910
03:28:44,950 --> 03:28:45,770
Sorry.

4911
03:28:45,770 --> 03:28:50,810
I... I got the wrong one.

4912
03:28:53,810 --> 03:28:54,330
Alright.

4913
03:28:57,790 --> 03:28:59,210
Sorry, give me a sec.

4914
03:29:01,190 --> 03:29:02,210
Give me a sec.

4915
03:29:02,370 --> 03:29:03,490
I got the wrong one.

4916
03:29:03,650 --> 03:29:04,490
Wait, which one?

4917
03:29:04,650 --> 03:29:07,390
Is it like... the top, top left?

4918
03:29:07,770 --> 03:29:09,030
Is it that one?

4919
03:29:09,290 --> 03:29:11,190
The top, top left one?

4920
03:29:11,430 --> 03:29:13,790
Or is it the... the one below it?

4921
03:29:14,190 --> 03:29:14,930
Oh my god.

4922
03:29:14,950 --> 03:29:15,690
God, whoops.

4923
03:29:16,330 --> 03:29:19,690
I... I'm sorry.

4924
03:29:19,990 --> 03:29:21,890
I wasn't listening to Kotlin.

4925
03:29:22,370 --> 03:29:23,770
I'm sorry.

4926
03:29:24,130 --> 03:29:26,990
I was absolutely not listening.

4927
03:29:27,790 --> 03:29:31,910
I know you had a really... Wait.

4928
03:29:32,670 --> 03:29:33,690
Oh my god.

4929
03:29:33,690 --> 03:29:34,470
The one word.

4930
03:29:34,690 --> 03:29:35,510
The one word.

4931
03:29:35,630 --> 03:29:36,410
There's a sword.

4932
03:29:36,870 --> 03:29:38,150
Wait, you're so right.

4933
03:29:38,310 --> 03:29:40,010
The one that has the sword.

4934
03:29:42,110 --> 03:29:43,730
Oh my god.

4935
03:29:43,770 --> 03:29:44,730
I can't read that.

4936
03:29:45,370 --> 03:29:47,010
I can't read that.

4937
03:29:48,810 --> 03:29:49,870
I'm sorry.

4938
03:29:49,870 --> 03:29:51,630
I failed the task.

4939
03:29:51,930 --> 03:29:53,670
I got the wrong one.

4940
03:29:54,630 --> 03:29:55,430
Don't worry.

4941
03:29:55,570 --> 03:29:55,990
I'm here now.

4942
03:29:56,130 --> 03:29:56,810
I figured it out.

4943
03:29:57,330 --> 03:29:59,170
I figured it out.

4944
03:30:13,670 --> 03:30:15,670
I just... I just... I just... I don't know.

4945
03:30:15,830 --> 03:30:16,990
It was a pretty symbol.

4946
03:30:17,270 --> 03:30:21,770
But like, in my mind... I didn't think that symbol meant anything.

4947
03:30:22,350 --> 03:30:27,110
I... I don't know why.

4948
03:30:27,190 --> 03:30:28,990
I thought that symbol didn't mean anything.

4949
03:30:28,990 --> 03:30:30,770
I just look pretty.

4950
03:30:30,930 --> 03:30:31,590
I just look pretty.

4951
03:30:31,670 --> 03:30:34,150
The enemy officer has been defeated.

4952
03:30:35,730 --> 03:30:36,730
Time to act.

4953
03:30:38,830 --> 03:30:39,690
My bad.

4954
03:30:40,950 --> 03:30:41,870
My bad.

4955
03:30:46,070 --> 03:30:47,110
Wait, guys.

4956
03:30:47,310 --> 03:30:48,070
Give me a sec.

4957
03:30:48,150 --> 03:30:50,410
I'll help out the other lieutenant soon.

4958
03:30:51,650 --> 03:30:53,490
I can't do this one.

4959
03:30:54,650 --> 03:30:55,850
Alright, I did it.

4960
03:30:56,250 --> 03:30:56,630
This terror attack is ours.

4961
03:30:56,950 --> 03:30:58,670
Our allies aren't yet ready.

4962
03:30:59,270 --> 03:31:01,130
You must wait for the right moment.

4963
03:31:02,030 --> 03:31:03,690
The enemy is on the back foot.

4964
03:31:04,530 --> 03:31:05,970
Soldiers, this is it.

4965
03:31:06,450 --> 03:31:08,270
Let us rip into their lives.

4966
03:31:09,410 --> 03:31:10,490
Start the advance.

4967
03:31:11,630 --> 03:31:11,970
Take this.

4968
03:31:12,230 --> 03:31:12,470
Okay.

4969
03:31:13,390 --> 03:31:16,450
The center of their formation looks to be unraveling.

4970
03:31:17,530 --> 03:31:18,770
Concentrate our troops there.

4971
03:31:18,770 --> 03:31:19,590
There we go.

4972
03:31:20,090 --> 03:31:20,970
I did it!

4973
03:31:25,230 --> 03:31:27,370
So, the trap is ready.

4974
03:31:27,990 --> 03:31:31,490
The time has come to set the plan into motion.

4975
03:31:31,710 --> 03:31:32,310
Don't worry.

4976
03:31:32,410 --> 03:31:33,550
We have the strong muscle.

4977
03:31:34,470 --> 03:31:36,290
I am certain you will see it done.

4978
03:31:36,810 --> 03:31:37,330
Boom!

4979
03:31:38,830 --> 03:31:40,110
Five booms!

4980
03:31:40,510 --> 03:31:41,150
Boom!

4981
03:31:41,150 --> 03:31:41,450
Boom!

4982
03:31:42,670 --> 03:31:45,170
The enemy officer has been defeated.

4983
03:31:47,150 --> 03:31:47,650
Alright.

4984
03:31:47,850 --> 03:31:48,230
Nice.

4985
03:31:49,950 --> 03:31:52,150
And then we can do a little twat!

4986
03:31:53,570 --> 03:31:54,210
That's right!

4987
03:31:54,330 --> 03:31:54,790
Oh, shit!

4988
03:31:55,590 --> 03:31:55,710
Oh!

4989
03:31:56,310 --> 03:31:56,730
Whoa!

4990
03:31:57,130 --> 03:31:57,390
Whoa!

4991
03:31:57,630 --> 03:31:57,930
Nice.

4992
03:31:59,290 --> 03:32:00,290
Wait, that's a nut!

4993
03:32:00,350 --> 03:32:00,990
Oh my god!

4994
03:32:01,910 --> 03:32:03,270
He did more than that?

4995
03:32:03,290 --> 03:32:04,910
But you don't have an actual name!

4996
03:32:08,530 --> 03:32:10,390
How do you have such a strong attack?

4997
03:32:15,750 --> 03:32:16,410
Oh my god.

4998
03:32:20,230 --> 03:32:20,910
It's okay.

4999
03:32:21,170 --> 03:32:22,450
I'm not scared.

5000
03:32:23,790 --> 03:32:25,130
I can take him!

5001
03:32:29,770 --> 03:32:30,510
Oh nice!

5002
03:32:30,670 --> 03:32:33,010
Okay, I killed him before he did his fancy thing!

5003
03:32:34,470 --> 03:32:37,570
It is just as Lord Chuga Leon said.

5004
03:32:38,070 --> 03:32:40,870
It will be my job to make sure this plan works.

5005
03:32:41,670 --> 03:32:44,170
Okay, what else are we missing in this plan?

5006
03:32:44,550 --> 03:32:45,410
I did my job.

5007
03:32:45,650 --> 03:32:47,810
I was late, but I did my job.

5008
03:32:50,030 --> 03:32:52,450
I was late, but it still worked.

5009
03:32:59,270 --> 03:33:00,910
Oh nice, it's doing it.

5010
03:33:01,830 --> 03:33:02,270
Nice!

5011
03:33:02,570 --> 03:33:02,870
Fire!

5012
03:33:09,850 --> 03:33:10,290
Nice.

5013
03:33:11,870 --> 03:33:13,650
Oh my god, they're all like so weak now.

5014
03:33:15,170 --> 03:33:16,530
That's actually so good for me.

5015
03:33:16,530 --> 03:33:18,610
Oh my god, they're all so weak.

5016
03:33:21,730 --> 03:33:24,650
They're like, you've been using strategy?

5017
03:33:25,850 --> 03:33:27,250
What is this?

5018
03:33:28,230 --> 03:33:29,990
This is a whole new world.

5019
03:33:37,990 --> 03:33:39,330
They're not used to it.

5020
03:33:39,430 --> 03:33:40,910
They're like, they're smart now?

5021
03:33:41,870 --> 03:33:44,190
We've got comrades currently engaged.

5022
03:33:44,830 --> 03:33:45,890
Let's go give them our support.

5023
03:33:46,270 --> 03:33:46,810
Boom.

5024
03:33:47,810 --> 03:33:50,110
The enemy officer has been defeated.

5025
03:33:51,690 --> 03:33:53,170
Okay, we killed everybody.

5026
03:33:53,490 --> 03:33:53,930
That's it.

5027
03:33:53,990 --> 03:33:54,370
Oh wait, no.

5028
03:33:54,590 --> 03:33:55,690
I forgot this guy.

5029
03:33:55,910 --> 03:33:57,090
The most important one.

5030
03:33:58,050 --> 03:33:59,230
Get out of here.

5031
03:33:59,290 --> 03:34:01,170
You have no HP now.

5032
03:34:01,490 --> 03:34:02,370
We use fire!

5033
03:34:03,950 --> 03:34:06,710
The enemy officer has been defeated.

5034
03:34:07,050 --> 03:34:07,450
There is the enemy officer.

5035
03:34:07,450 --> 03:34:08,950
They have brains now.

5036
03:34:09,230 --> 03:34:09,570
No!

5037
03:34:10,530 --> 03:34:13,590
Charge them head on and push into their main camp.

5038
03:34:13,810 --> 03:34:14,070
Let's go.

5039
03:34:14,610 --> 03:34:15,690
All right, we'll go this way.

5040
03:34:16,530 --> 03:34:17,410
This way's faster.

5041
03:34:18,490 --> 03:34:20,210
What an incredible plan.

5042
03:34:20,730 --> 03:34:22,170
Ambitious and yet exact.

5043
03:34:22,750 --> 03:34:25,810
Chigulian is as talented as Liu Bei believes in to be.

5044
03:34:26,010 --> 03:34:26,630
Sorry.

5045
03:34:27,210 --> 03:34:28,350
It's so...

5046
03:34:28,350 --> 03:34:29,850
It's so funny.

5047
03:34:30,130 --> 03:34:31,350
I'm trying to pronounce his name.

5048
03:34:32,990 --> 03:34:34,610
It's different every time.

5049
03:34:34,970 --> 03:34:35,930
Don't worry, Chigutland.

5050
03:34:35,930 --> 03:34:37,990
I don't know how it feels.

5051
03:34:40,430 --> 03:34:42,330
I got you in please.

5052
03:34:45,090 --> 03:34:46,630
All right, open the door.

5053
03:34:57,630 --> 03:34:58,930
All right, nice.

5054
03:35:00,190 --> 03:35:01,830
We do a twirl!

5055
03:35:03,310 --> 03:35:04,030
Twirl!

5056
03:35:06,750 --> 03:35:08,090
Ultra twirl!

5057
03:35:09,090 --> 03:35:09,810
Slash!

5058
03:35:09,810 --> 03:35:11,650
Oh my god, look at our combo!

5059
03:35:12,250 --> 03:35:15,810
Oh my god, it's like we're like meant to be, Guan Yun!

5060
03:35:16,790 --> 03:35:18,890
That was such a good combo!

5061
03:35:27,620 --> 03:35:28,580
Okay, nice.

5062
03:35:28,820 --> 03:35:30,260
All right, I have more for it.

5063
03:35:31,360 --> 03:35:33,800
Oh my god, we're just like running in.

5064
03:35:35,380 --> 03:35:37,320
Oh my god, finally!

5065
03:35:37,840 --> 03:35:38,400
Finally!

5066
03:35:38,860 --> 03:35:40,420
A successful charge!

5067
03:35:42,460 --> 03:35:45,460
Oh my god, I completed an actual training!

5068
03:35:47,440 --> 03:35:48,580
Where are we?

5069
03:35:50,380 --> 03:35:52,280
You call that an officer?

5070
03:35:54,060 --> 03:35:56,220
All right, this is where the main guy is.

5071
03:35:57,520 --> 03:35:58,880
I should just go straight in.

5072
03:35:58,980 --> 03:35:59,860
What the fuck am I doing?

5073
03:36:03,820 --> 03:36:04,880
How do I get there?

5074
03:36:05,680 --> 03:36:06,460
Like this way?

5075
03:36:06,620 --> 03:36:07,360
Oh, it's this way.

5076
03:36:08,680 --> 03:36:09,760
Yeah, what am I doing?

5077
03:36:10,080 --> 03:36:11,000
Why am I just like letting...

5078
03:36:13,660 --> 03:36:14,540
Go straight in.

5079
03:36:18,180 --> 03:36:19,120
That's right.

5080
03:36:20,680 --> 03:36:21,560
That's right.

5081
03:36:21,700 --> 03:36:21,800
That's right!

5082
03:36:21,800 --> 03:36:22,800
I'm coming in!

5083
03:36:28,000 --> 03:36:29,160
Where are you?

5084
03:36:31,920 --> 03:36:33,140
There we go.

5085
03:36:33,860 --> 03:36:34,860
That's right!

5086
03:36:37,960 --> 03:36:39,480
Get over here!

5087
03:36:39,680 --> 03:36:41,560
I'm not done with you!

5088
03:36:43,280 --> 03:36:43,880
I'm not done with you!

5089
03:36:43,880 --> 03:36:44,580
Wait, where did you go?

5090
03:36:49,570 --> 03:36:51,470
I'm not done with you!

5091
03:36:51,650 --> 03:36:52,330
Where are you?

5092
03:36:53,830 --> 03:36:55,650
Where did I miss?

5093
03:36:55,870 --> 03:36:56,390
Where is he?

5094
03:36:59,210 --> 03:37:00,990
Oh, you think it's over?

5095
03:37:01,830 --> 03:37:02,890
That's right!

5096
03:37:03,690 --> 03:37:05,530
It's not over!

5097
03:37:06,070 --> 03:37:07,190
Wait, but where is he?

5098
03:37:07,770 --> 03:37:09,050
Hey, where is he?

5099
03:37:15,270 --> 03:37:16,450
Oh, there he is!

5100
03:37:16,450 --> 03:37:17,990
I lost him!

5101
03:37:18,170 --> 03:37:19,910
I actually lost him!

5102
03:37:20,350 --> 03:37:21,390
Get over here!

5103
03:37:22,310 --> 03:37:23,050
It's time!

5104
03:37:29,070 --> 03:37:30,370
It's time!

5105
03:37:33,310 --> 03:37:35,570
I will twirl forever!

5106
03:37:40,390 --> 03:37:41,770
Domain Expansion!

5107
03:37:46,450 --> 03:37:46,630
Boom!

5108
03:37:50,750 --> 03:37:51,330
Easy!

5109
03:37:54,590 --> 03:37:55,750
Twirl Maxing!

5110
03:37:56,270 --> 03:37:57,350
Oh my god!

5111
03:37:57,530 --> 03:37:59,530
His one strike traveled all the way here!

5112
03:38:01,590 --> 03:38:04,070
The God of War has done it again!

5113
03:38:10,770 --> 03:38:12,770
Oh wait, I can hold this!

5114
03:38:13,970 --> 03:38:16,110
I didn't realize I can hold this attack!

5115
03:38:16,450 --> 03:38:18,990
This will likely slow down South-South forces!

5116
03:38:19,830 --> 03:38:22,910
So we can plan our defense of Jing province in the meantime!

5117
03:38:25,530 --> 03:38:27,210
I learned something new today!

5118
03:38:27,890 --> 03:38:30,230
I could actually hold my attack, guys!

5119
03:38:32,830 --> 03:38:33,390
Yay!

5120
03:38:33,670 --> 03:38:34,310
Level 25!

5121
03:38:37,470 --> 03:38:39,830
Yeah, I was not holding it the entire time!

5122
03:38:40,070 --> 03:38:41,530
I don't know if you guys noticed that!

5123
03:38:44,430 --> 03:38:45,650
Was that obvious?

5124
03:39:04,590 --> 03:39:07,850
Is this what it's like to use strategy?

5125
03:39:08,390 --> 03:39:11,610
If we were by ourselves, we would have been well on our way to retreat!

5126
03:39:12,370 --> 03:39:12,930
But now...

5127
03:39:12,930 --> 03:39:13,850
Oh my god!

5128
03:39:14,150 --> 03:39:16,510
I hope I was able to show some of what I am capable of!

5129
03:39:17,750 --> 03:39:18,330
You did!

5130
03:39:19,150 --> 03:39:19,710
Strategy?

5131
03:39:19,910 --> 03:39:22,010
I can now see why brother regards you so highly!

5132
03:39:22,710 --> 03:39:23,270
Yes!

5133
03:39:23,670 --> 03:39:24,210
Well...

5134
03:39:24,210 --> 03:39:25,030
Fine!

5135
03:39:25,490 --> 03:39:28,130
I'll consider you on par with Shishu!

5136
03:39:28,130 --> 03:39:28,150
No!

5137
03:39:31,740 --> 03:39:33,580
That is more than I could ask for!

5138
03:39:34,880 --> 03:39:37,780
I wish to build good relations with all of you here!

5139
03:39:39,380 --> 03:39:42,440
A strategist acts as the mind of an army!

5140
03:39:43,280 --> 03:39:44,040
But...

5141
03:39:44,040 --> 03:39:45,700
We are powerless...

5142
03:39:45,700 --> 03:39:46,880
Without capable limbs!

5143
03:39:48,520 --> 03:39:50,820
And warriors such as you...

5144
03:39:50,820 --> 03:39:53,700
Who have assisted Lord Liu Bei for so long...

5145
03:39:54,120 --> 03:39:58,860
Are a necessary part of the plans I've laid towards our ultimate victory!

5146
03:40:00,160 --> 03:40:00,920
Now...

5147
03:40:00,920 --> 03:40:02,080
Do excuse me...

5148
03:40:02,080 --> 03:40:04,380
I must see to some post-battle matters!

5149
03:40:05,320 --> 03:40:05,660
Well...

5150
03:40:05,660 --> 03:40:06,360
What is he gonna do?

5151
03:40:08,020 --> 03:40:09,100
You know...

5152
03:40:09,100 --> 03:40:10,660
He may be a schemer...

5153
03:40:11,320 --> 03:40:12,440
By the way...

5154
03:40:12,440 --> 03:40:13,540
He flatters people...

5155
03:40:13,540 --> 03:40:15,380
Might be a bit like brother...

5156
03:40:18,280 --> 03:40:18,660
Uh...

5157
03:40:18,660 --> 03:40:19,940
But only a tiny bit...

5158
03:40:21,620 --> 03:40:22,300
Wait!

5159
03:40:22,460 --> 03:40:23,240
Why is he leaving?

5160
03:40:24,380 --> 03:40:26,200
Why don't you wanna...

5161
03:40:26,700 --> 03:40:27,640
Why are you leaving?

5162
03:40:28,020 --> 03:40:28,380
Sir?

5163
03:40:32,660 --> 03:40:33,840
Why are you leaving me?

5164
03:40:36,380 --> 03:40:38,620
I thought we had something!

5165
03:40:39,100 --> 03:40:40,860
We did your strategy!

5166
03:40:41,320 --> 03:40:41,520
Have you heard?

5167
03:40:41,840 --> 03:40:43,640
They say there's a dragon living...

5168
03:40:43,640 --> 03:40:45,840
We did his strategy and then he leaves?!

5169
03:40:49,950 --> 03:40:52,970
There is something we must tell you...

5170
03:40:52,970 --> 03:40:58,350
We have heard that Lord Liu Bei fell ill a few days ago...

5171
03:40:58,350 --> 03:40:59,610
His condition appears to be quite serious...

5172
03:40:59,610 --> 03:41:00,810
Honey, why do you have us?

5173
03:41:01,550 --> 03:41:02,870
I mean...

5174
03:41:02,870 --> 03:41:04,780
He is getting pretty old...

5175
03:41:04,780 --> 03:41:05,420
Born brothers!

5176
03:41:05,920 --> 03:41:08,160
They say he doesn't have a lot of time...

5177
03:41:08,160 --> 03:41:11,100
He found the doll and then it felt awkward...

5178
03:41:11,100 --> 03:41:12,620
Having me in the same room...

5179
03:41:12,620 --> 03:41:13,920
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

5180
03:41:17,720 --> 03:41:20,780
Another storm will be brewing once Liu Biao is gone...

5181
03:41:21,480 --> 03:41:26,160
And just when we found a place to call home to...

5182
03:41:27,080 --> 03:41:27,560
Indeed...

5183
03:41:27,560 --> 03:41:31,040
The circumstances are similar to when Lord Tao Chin...

5184
03:41:31,040 --> 03:41:33,020
Asked brother to be his successor...

5185
03:41:33,020 --> 03:41:34,410
Back then...

5186
03:41:34,740 --> 03:41:37,400
He refused the offer of governorship...

5187
03:41:37,400 --> 03:41:41,480
Which eventually led to Louis Bu taking over Shu Province...

5188
03:41:41,480 --> 03:41:42,980
But now...

5189
03:41:42,980 --> 03:41:46,600
That Lord Chugu Lian is our strategist...

5190
03:41:46,600 --> 03:41:47,410
I wonder...

5191
03:41:48,300 --> 03:41:51,410
If brother's answer will be different this time around...

5192
03:42:01,770 --> 03:42:02,370
So...

5193
03:42:02,370 --> 03:42:05,330
You wish for me to take over as Jing's leader?

5194
03:42:06,110 --> 03:42:09,470
Cao Cao currently controls the entirety of Hebei...

5195
03:42:09,470 --> 03:42:12,330
And will continue to focus on invading Jing...

5196
03:42:14,150 --> 03:42:15,710
Should he succeed...

5197
03:42:16,030 --> 03:42:20,430
No one in the land will have the strength to oppose him...

5198
03:42:21,350 --> 03:42:24,290
Now that Lord Liu Biao has fallen ill...

5199
03:42:24,290 --> 03:42:29,930
You may be the only one who can defend the province from Cao Cao, my lord...

5200
03:42:32,950 --> 03:42:34,950
Given the circumstances...

5201
03:42:34,950 --> 03:42:36,470
Perhaps I should be more blunt...

5202
03:42:37,590 --> 03:42:41,510
Taking Jing is a way for us to put a stop to Cao Cao's advance...

5203
03:42:42,270 --> 03:42:43,510
But at the same time...

5204
03:42:44,090 --> 03:42:46,610
It will be a first step toward a greater goal...

5205
03:42:48,430 --> 03:42:51,010
Once Jing is under our control...

5206
03:42:51,330 --> 03:42:53,630
Let us go on and obtain Yi...

5207
03:42:53,630 --> 03:42:54,610
Oh my gosh...

5208
03:42:55,450 --> 03:42:56,610
We're doing so much...

5209
03:42:57,370 --> 03:43:00,510
Making it particularly important...

5210
03:43:00,510 --> 03:43:01,830
Liu Zhang...

5211
03:43:01,830 --> 03:43:03,570
Who currently rules Yi...

5212
03:43:03,570 --> 03:43:04,170
Slow down!

5213
03:43:04,470 --> 03:43:04,850
Slow down!

5214
03:43:05,470 --> 03:43:07,230
Like, this is our first time!

5215
03:43:07,790 --> 03:43:09,570
We never had a strategist before!

5216
03:43:10,890 --> 03:43:12,030
My lord...

5217
03:43:12,470 --> 03:43:15,650
If you were to decide to rule both Yi and Jing...

5218
03:43:15,650 --> 03:43:18,830
The common folk would accept it with open arms...

5219
03:43:18,830 --> 03:43:19,890
Not used to it!

5220
03:43:21,250 --> 03:43:22,710
By taking both provinces...

5221
03:43:23,350 --> 03:43:25,510
And allying ourselves with Su and Chuan...

5222
03:43:25,510 --> 03:43:26,790
Who controls Jiang Dong...

5223
03:43:27,870 --> 03:43:28,530
Our factions...

5224
03:43:28,530 --> 03:43:30,250
Trying to understand his strategy!

5225
03:43:31,250 --> 03:43:32,210
He's like...

5226
03:43:32,210 --> 03:43:33,530
I never see you're this quiet...

5227
03:43:33,530 --> 03:43:35,570
I... I'm trying to understand!

5228
03:43:38,810 --> 03:43:42,250
That will require me to stand up against Lord Cao Cao.

5229
03:43:43,190 --> 03:43:44,230
I've never...

5230
03:43:44,230 --> 03:43:44,910
I've never...

5231
03:43:44,910 --> 03:43:45,010
I've...

5232
03:43:45,010 --> 03:43:47,430
I joined the Angabunga army to not think!

5233
03:43:47,910 --> 03:43:48,390
Lord Cao Cao, Lord Sun Quan...

5234
03:43:48,390 --> 03:43:50,610
And myself sharing power...

5235
03:43:50,610 --> 03:43:52,570
Splitting the realm into three...

5236
03:43:53,250 --> 03:43:57,990
But I cannot and will not steal Jing away from the rightful successor of Lord Liu Biao...

5237
03:43:57,990 --> 03:43:59,410
Not when he has treated us so well...

5238
03:44:00,370 --> 03:44:03,270
Instead, we ought to support him while he is ill...

5239
03:44:03,270 --> 03:44:07,950
I would be willing to take over the administration of the province...

5240
03:44:07,950 --> 03:44:08,710
But...

5241
03:44:08,710 --> 03:44:12,210
Taking Jing for myself would not be my way...

5242
03:44:12,930 --> 03:44:15,130
That is but a betrayal of trust...

5243
03:44:15,130 --> 03:44:17,950
And it is not something I wish to do...

5244
03:44:18,570 --> 03:44:19,710
Of course...

5245
03:44:19,710 --> 03:44:20,530
Then...

5246
03:44:20,530 --> 03:44:22,950
I will not force this upon you...

5247
03:44:23,870 --> 03:44:25,930
You aren't going to attempt to convince me?

5248
03:44:26,390 --> 03:44:29,950
I was sure you were going to say as much from the beginning...

5249
03:44:31,230 --> 03:44:31,750
However...

5250
03:44:31,750 --> 03:44:33,990
This will limit our options...

5251
03:44:33,990 --> 03:44:36,450
It may make our path...

5252
03:44:36,450 --> 03:44:37,330
Much more arduous...

5253
03:44:39,750 --> 03:44:41,190
I do not care...

5254
03:44:41,890 --> 03:44:45,210
There cannot be anything more difficult than betraying my own principles...

5255
03:44:46,050 --> 03:44:46,990
I understand...

5256
03:44:47,790 --> 03:44:50,190
Goddamn stupid benevolence...

5257
03:44:50,190 --> 03:44:51,430
Fool...

5258
03:44:51,990 --> 03:44:54,770
You can tell that Jukotlen is like...

5259
03:44:54,770 --> 03:44:55,910
I hope...

5260
03:44:55,910 --> 03:44:57,090
I hate you...

5261
03:44:57,990 --> 03:44:58,750
He's like...

5262
03:44:58,750 --> 03:44:59,630
He's like...

5263
03:44:59,630 --> 03:45:02,090
Maybe he's not fixable...

5264
03:45:05,170 --> 03:45:07,530
His son went on to succeed him...

5265
03:45:07,530 --> 03:45:10,370
Leaving Lu Bei with the task of guiding the young leader...

5266
03:45:10,770 --> 03:45:11,050
Meanwhile...

5267
03:45:11,050 --> 03:45:13,390
Tata was personally leading his great army...

5268
03:45:13,390 --> 03:45:14,990
Towards Jing province...

5269
03:45:16,790 --> 03:45:17,830
You know...

5270
03:45:17,830 --> 03:45:20,330
This might be weird for me to say...

5271
03:45:20,330 --> 03:45:20,870
But...

5272
03:45:20,870 --> 03:45:25,090
I'm actually glad that Liu Song took over for Liu Biao...

5273
03:45:27,620 --> 03:45:28,600
Why are you glad?

5274
03:45:29,800 --> 03:45:30,320
Well...

5275
03:45:30,320 --> 03:45:31,420
Xiu Gu Lian...

5276
03:45:31,420 --> 03:45:34,860
Tried to talk brother into succeeding Liu Biao...

5277
03:45:34,860 --> 03:45:35,400
But...

5278
03:45:35,400 --> 03:45:36,600
He said no...

5279
03:45:38,960 --> 03:45:39,800
Is that bad?

5280
03:45:40,060 --> 03:45:43,640
It just goes to show that he's still the same man as ever...

5281
03:45:43,640 --> 03:45:45,460
One who sticks to his principles...

5282
03:45:45,460 --> 03:45:46,380
Oh my god, that's what we're losing!

5283
03:45:46,900 --> 03:45:48,240
We might have talked about this before...

5284
03:45:48,240 --> 03:45:48,620
But...

5285
03:45:48,620 --> 03:45:51,660
You know how our responsibilities have changed a lot...

5286
03:45:51,660 --> 03:45:51,960
Right?

5287
03:45:55,080 --> 03:45:55,680
Hmm...

5288
03:45:55,680 --> 03:45:56,080
But brother...

5289
03:45:56,500 --> 03:45:58,960
His heart hasn't changed since the very beginning...

5290
03:45:59,620 --> 03:46:03,320
His decision made that obvious...

5291
03:46:03,960 --> 03:46:05,960
That's the kind of man I wanna support...

5292
03:46:06,720 --> 03:46:07,780
He has...

5293
03:46:08,380 --> 03:46:08,980
Charisma...

5294
03:46:08,980 --> 03:46:10,920
Something I suppose every...

5295
03:46:10,920 --> 03:46:12,300
He only has Charisma!

5296
03:46:13,040 --> 03:46:14,260
That's his own issue!

5297
03:46:14,760 --> 03:46:16,240
That's all he has!

5298
03:46:16,760 --> 03:46:18,220
He needs to be careful to maintain it...

5299
03:46:18,220 --> 03:46:20,160
Everybody wants to fix him!

5300
03:46:20,640 --> 03:46:22,880
Even though we may not have a big plan in mind...

5301
03:46:22,880 --> 03:46:24,740
My brother or Xiu Gu Lian...

5302
03:46:24,740 --> 03:46:27,060
Let's keep moving forward...

5303
03:46:27,060 --> 03:46:28,320
Through sheer grit...

5304
03:46:28,320 --> 03:46:29,980
And effort...

5305
03:46:31,340 --> 03:46:31,940
Alright...

5306
03:46:31,940 --> 03:46:34,040
I'll do what I can...

5307
03:46:34,040 --> 03:46:35,320
Humble as ever, huh?

5308
03:46:35,920 --> 03:46:38,900
But I know you are the kind of guy who gets stuff...

5309
03:46:39,860 --> 03:46:40,160
Done...

5310
03:46:40,560 --> 03:46:41,480
Right then!

5311
03:46:42,000 --> 03:46:45,820
Let's go give that bastard, Tau Tau, something to sweat about!

5312
03:46:52,720 --> 03:46:54,940
Liu Bei and his sworn brothers fight...

5313
03:46:54,940 --> 03:46:55,600
Alright...

5314
03:46:55,600 --> 03:46:56,100
Wait...

5315
03:46:56,100 --> 03:46:58,000
There's so many people that wants to talk to...

5316
03:46:58,000 --> 03:46:59,000
I'm so popular!

5317
03:46:59,940 --> 03:47:02,480
There's so many people that wants to talk to me!

5318
03:47:04,280 --> 03:47:04,880
Hello?

5319
03:47:05,320 --> 03:47:05,660
Hey!

5320
03:47:06,240 --> 03:47:07,200
Lord Guan Yu!

5321
03:47:07,860 --> 03:47:08,760
Training up?

5322
03:47:09,560 --> 03:47:09,960
Yes!

5323
03:47:10,660 --> 03:47:12,080
And from the looks of it...

5324
03:47:12,080 --> 03:47:13,680
You've been doing likewise...

5325
03:47:13,680 --> 03:47:14,760
I want to eat lasagna tonight...

5326
03:47:16,000 --> 03:47:17,120
I don't know...

5327
03:47:17,680 --> 03:47:19,760
I feel like it's a lasagna day...

5328
03:47:21,620 --> 03:47:23,760
So I figured I would do what I can...

5329
03:47:23,760 --> 03:47:24,400
While I can...

5330
03:47:24,400 --> 03:47:25,720
Sorry, I came out of nowhere...

5331
03:47:25,720 --> 03:47:26,080
I just...

5332
03:47:26,080 --> 03:47:28,760
I just had a craving for lasagna for some reason...

5333
03:47:29,200 --> 03:47:31,120
Well, that is a good start...

5334
03:47:31,120 --> 03:47:32,440
What if I order lasagna?

5335
03:47:32,600 --> 03:47:33,160
You know, I'm...

5336
03:47:33,160 --> 03:47:34,300
Okay, I'm gonna be like...

5337
03:47:34,300 --> 03:47:36,180
I'm gonna order lasagna right now...

5338
03:47:36,640 --> 03:47:37,400
I'm gonna be...

5339
03:47:37,400 --> 03:47:38,320
Alright, sorry...

5340
03:47:38,320 --> 03:47:39,760
I need to use my phone to order lasagna...

5341
03:47:40,300 --> 03:47:42,240
We cannot let that happen...

5342
03:47:42,240 --> 03:47:42,760
Joe Zhang...

5343
03:47:43,460 --> 03:47:44,760
Spar with me for a round...

5344
03:47:46,600 --> 03:47:46,960
Oh...

5345
03:47:46,960 --> 03:47:47,660
Seriously?

5346
03:47:49,000 --> 03:47:49,360
Absolutely!

5347
03:47:49,360 --> 03:47:50,620
Oh my god...

5348
03:47:50,620 --> 03:47:52,760
I get to Spar with my senpai?

5349
03:47:57,860 --> 03:47:58,610
Wait, what?

5350
03:47:59,130 --> 03:48:00,070
That's it?

5351
03:48:00,970 --> 03:48:02,210
I thought...

5352
03:48:02,210 --> 03:48:02,570
What?

5353
03:48:03,370 --> 03:48:05,170
Okay, I thought I had like...

5354
03:48:05,170 --> 03:48:07,110
More purpose in this story...

5355
03:48:09,770 --> 03:48:11,190
I thought, you know...

5356
03:48:11,190 --> 03:48:13,070
I had a bigger purpose there...

5357
03:48:19,110 --> 03:48:20,350
Okay, lasagna...

5358
03:48:22,070 --> 03:48:23,670
What the best option would have been...

5359
03:48:24,850 --> 03:48:25,890
I just like...

5360
03:48:25,890 --> 03:48:26,390
Watched...

5361
03:48:26,390 --> 03:48:28,210
Another person's...

5362
03:48:28,210 --> 03:48:29,750
Another person's like...

5363
03:48:29,750 --> 03:48:30,570
Route...

5364
03:48:30,990 --> 03:48:31,290
It...

5365
03:48:31,290 --> 03:48:32,890
Didn't include me...

5366
03:48:34,070 --> 03:48:36,910
With a massive army advancing toward us...

5367
03:48:36,910 --> 03:48:38,590
Would that not have been the best option?

5368
03:48:38,890 --> 03:48:42,310
I cannot see Lord Liu Song being up for a fight...

5369
03:48:44,830 --> 03:48:45,750
Where's my lasagna?

5370
03:48:48,650 --> 03:48:49,250
Alright...

5371
03:48:49,250 --> 03:48:50,510
You might be right...

5372
03:48:50,510 --> 03:48:51,130
Sorry, I wasn't...

5373
03:48:51,130 --> 03:48:51,730
I didn't say what...

5374
03:48:51,730 --> 03:48:53,310
I didn't say what Daoyun was saying...

5375
03:48:53,310 --> 03:48:53,690
But...

5376
03:48:53,690 --> 03:48:54,300
He must be right...

5377
03:48:54,850 --> 03:48:54,870
Still...

5378
03:48:54,870 --> 03:48:57,140
I am also somewhat glad that things have gone this way...

5379
03:48:58,090 --> 03:49:01,130
Lord Liu Bei is a man who brings honor to these lands...

5380
03:49:01,670 --> 03:49:04,130
That is why so many are willing to follow him...

5381
03:49:05,090 --> 03:49:05,830
For me...

5382
03:49:05,830 --> 03:49:10,130
It was witnessing how he risks his life to see justice done that won my loyalty...

5383
03:49:12,430 --> 03:49:16,150
If he had changed his ways and take a Jing from Lord Liu Song...

5384
03:49:16,150 --> 03:49:18,290
Perhaps his followers would have deserted him...

5385
03:49:21,470 --> 03:49:25,210
Such a choice could have ruined all that he's built up over the years...

5386
03:49:28,490 --> 03:49:29,790
But whatever the case...

5387
03:49:30,530 --> 03:49:33,790
It is our duty as his retainers to keep him safe...

5388
03:49:36,810 --> 03:49:38,690
No matter how formidable our adversary...

5389
03:49:38,690 --> 03:49:40,170
Okay, the last time we had...

5390
03:49:41,010 --> 03:49:41,490
We...

5391
03:49:41,490 --> 03:49:43,230
We let him be his guard...

5392
03:49:43,230 --> 03:49:44,010
He like failed...

5393
03:49:44,010 --> 03:49:45,210
So I don't know...

5394
03:49:45,210 --> 03:49:48,110
Like he's clearly not doing his job very well though...

5395
03:49:48,110 --> 03:49:48,830
I don't trust him...

5396
03:49:50,730 --> 03:49:53,310
I want to order a caprese salad too...

5397
03:49:53,310 --> 03:49:54,020
I want to be fancy...

5398
03:49:54,650 --> 03:49:55,310
Why are you here?

5399
03:49:55,810 --> 03:49:56,830
Lord Liu Bei...

5400
03:49:58,210 --> 03:50:00,850
You have come to call for our surrender, have you not?

5401
03:50:01,210 --> 03:50:01,670
Huh?

5402
03:50:01,930 --> 03:50:03,000
As a messenger of Cao Cao...

5403
03:50:03,570 --> 03:50:04,940
I see you have not changed...

5404
03:50:05,850 --> 03:50:07,410
Wait, he's blue now!

5405
03:50:07,770 --> 03:50:08,730
You'll see through it all...

5406
03:50:08,730 --> 03:50:09,830
Even without a word...

5407
03:50:11,130 --> 03:50:14,020
Lord Liu Song has already surrendered to Cao Cao's forces...

5408
03:50:15,330 --> 03:50:15,790
What?

5409
03:50:15,850 --> 03:50:18,020
He supposedly promised that he would hand you over...

5410
03:50:20,070 --> 03:50:20,590
No...

5411
03:50:20,590 --> 03:50:21,030
Treaty!

5412
03:50:22,150 --> 03:50:23,310
I'mma five your mom!

5413
03:50:25,810 --> 03:50:28,730
The moment Lord Liu Song switches the lines...

5414
03:50:28,730 --> 03:50:29,930
You lost...

5415
03:50:29,930 --> 03:50:32,030
And while this may be unexpected...

5416
03:50:32,030 --> 03:50:34,170
Coming from your enemy's messenger...

5417
03:50:34,170 --> 03:50:35,130
Lord Liu Bei...

5418
03:50:35,130 --> 03:50:36,250
I beg of you...

5419
03:50:36,250 --> 03:50:38,070
You must escape...

5420
03:50:38,070 --> 03:50:39,990
You will have more opportunities...

5421
03:50:39,990 --> 03:50:41,670
As long as you stay alive...

5422
03:50:41,670 --> 03:50:43,110
Okay, I got my lasagna...

5423
03:50:43,110 --> 03:50:45,130
And my caprese salad...

5424
03:50:45,130 --> 03:50:45,570
Although...

5425
03:50:45,570 --> 03:50:47,250
That is not to say...

5426
03:50:47,250 --> 03:50:49,010
It is impossible to defend...

5427
03:50:49,010 --> 03:50:49,170
I'm...

5428
03:50:49,170 --> 03:50:50,350
I know where your mom lives...

5429
03:50:50,350 --> 03:50:51,190
While fending off...

5430
03:50:51,190 --> 03:50:52,250
Cao Cao's army...

5431
03:50:53,870 --> 03:50:55,350
You're saying there's a way?

5432
03:50:56,750 --> 03:50:57,330
Indeed...

5433
03:50:57,330 --> 03:51:00,670
We can use the people of Xinyu as decoys...

5434
03:51:00,670 --> 03:51:03,550
To lure the enemy forces into the castle...

5435
03:51:03,550 --> 03:51:04,030
There...

5436
03:51:04,030 --> 03:51:05,650
We crush them...

5437
03:51:05,650 --> 03:51:07,250
That will not do...

5438
03:51:08,030 --> 03:51:09,500
By employing such tactics...

5439
03:51:09,850 --> 03:51:11,550
We will be robbing the people of Xinyu...

5440
03:51:11,550 --> 03:51:13,500
Of the ability to decide their own fates...

5441
03:51:14,500 --> 03:51:17,560
Which is why I said that Xinyu is correct...

5442
03:51:17,560 --> 03:51:19,840
I know your mom's bed...

5443
03:51:19,840 --> 03:51:20,460
Very well...

5444
03:51:20,460 --> 03:51:21,420
See you later...

5445
03:51:21,420 --> 03:51:22,100
Son...

5446
03:51:25,240 --> 03:51:28,920
I can winy buddy...

5447
03:51:28,920 --> 03:51:29,540
Let's do that...

5448
03:51:29,540 --> 03:51:31,240
I know...

5449
03:51:31,240 --> 03:51:32,980
Why is he saying all that?

5450
03:51:33,380 --> 03:51:37,560
When Cao Cao's strategist is literally just standing there...

5451
03:51:38,400 --> 03:51:39,700
He's just like...

5452
03:51:39,700 --> 03:51:39,980
Wait...

5453
03:51:39,980 --> 03:51:41,120
So what are you guys gonna do again?

5454
03:51:42,740 --> 03:51:48,280
I wish to be with you in spirit...

5455
03:51:48,280 --> 03:51:50,160
Do not provide strategies to him...

5456
03:51:50,160 --> 03:51:51,370
Not now...

5457
03:51:51,900 --> 03:51:52,290
Or ever...

5458
03:51:53,020 --> 03:51:55,280
I might not be able to advise you directly...

5459
03:51:55,940 --> 03:51:56,520
Bro...

5460
03:51:56,520 --> 03:51:57,320
Wouldn't he like...

5461
03:51:57,320 --> 03:51:58,780
Be suspicious about that?

5462
03:52:00,100 --> 03:52:00,680
No...

5463
03:52:00,680 --> 03:52:05,160
Any subterfuge of that kind would only be a detriment...

5464
03:52:05,160 --> 03:52:05,450
Instead...

5465
03:52:06,080 --> 03:52:08,880
Would you be willing to help us plan our next move?

5466
03:52:11,380 --> 03:52:12,530
You want me...

5467
03:52:13,080 --> 03:52:14,200
To help you plan?

5468
03:52:15,460 --> 03:52:17,720
Abandoning the castle is worth...

5469
03:52:17,720 --> 03:52:18,620
I feel like...

5470
03:52:18,620 --> 03:52:19,200
Knowing that...

5471
03:52:19,200 --> 03:52:20,580
He worked with Lu Bei...

5472
03:52:20,580 --> 03:52:21,420
He should have like...

5473
03:52:21,420 --> 03:52:23,140
An actual guard with him...

5474
03:52:23,140 --> 03:52:23,760
Some sort of strategy...

5475
03:52:23,760 --> 03:52:25,720
To avoid this situation...

5476
03:52:26,400 --> 03:52:27,640
I am certain...

5477
03:52:27,640 --> 03:52:28,720
That we can make that strategy...

5478
03:52:29,380 --> 03:52:29,740
Even better...

5479
03:52:30,780 --> 03:52:31,120
Like...

5480
03:52:31,660 --> 03:52:31,920
Like...

5481
03:52:31,920 --> 03:52:33,160
They know that...

5482
03:52:33,600 --> 03:52:34,120
He's like...

5483
03:52:34,120 --> 03:52:35,020
Really close with Lu Bei...

5484
03:52:35,020 --> 03:52:36,780
Why did they not send him a guard?

5485
03:52:37,140 --> 03:52:38,720
Cao Cao will not notice...

5486
03:52:39,860 --> 03:52:41,860
You really haven't changed...

5487
03:52:41,860 --> 03:52:42,400
Have you?

5488
03:52:44,260 --> 03:52:44,780
Fine...

5489
03:52:44,780 --> 03:52:47,360
A small contribution it shall be...

5490
03:52:47,720 --> 03:52:49,520
I trust you shall utilize it...

5491
03:52:49,520 --> 03:52:50,720
To aid Lord Lu Bei's cause...

5492
03:52:57,000 --> 03:52:57,440
Yeah...

5493
03:52:57,440 --> 03:52:58,660
I feel like that's weird...

5494
03:52:58,660 --> 03:52:58,820
I...

5495
03:52:58,820 --> 03:53:00,840
I feel like you would bring...

5496
03:53:00,840 --> 03:53:01,200
Like...

5497
03:53:01,200 --> 03:53:02,640
Someone to look after him...

5498
03:53:02,640 --> 03:53:04,060
To make sure he's not gonna like...

5499
03:53:04,060 --> 03:53:05,980
Betray you...

5500
03:53:05,980 --> 03:53:07,620
I'm gonna check my super chats...

5501
03:53:10,780 --> 03:53:11,220
Nobody...

5502
03:53:11,220 --> 03:53:12,260
Thank you for the super chat...

5503
03:53:12,260 --> 03:53:12,620
Thank you...

5504
03:53:13,400 --> 03:53:14,280
Not Doki...

5505
03:53:14,280 --> 03:53:15,340
Can you guess who this is from?

5506
03:53:15,340 --> 03:53:16,960
I don't suppose so...

5507
03:53:16,960 --> 03:53:18,200
I'm no one special...

5508
03:53:18,200 --> 03:53:19,360
Just one of the soldiers...

5509
03:53:19,360 --> 03:53:20,560
You're always saving...

5510
03:53:20,560 --> 03:53:21,180
These days...

5511
03:53:21,180 --> 03:53:22,080
Even the commoners...

5512
03:53:22,080 --> 03:53:23,340
Are aware of the hardship...

5513
03:53:23,340 --> 03:53:24,500
Lord Lu Bei is...

5514
03:53:24,500 --> 03:53:25,220
Facing...

5515
03:53:25,220 --> 03:53:26,500
He may even be driven...

5516
03:53:26,500 --> 03:53:27,480
Out of his current territory...

5517
03:53:28,140 --> 03:53:28,980
Which is why...

5518
03:53:28,980 --> 03:53:30,620
Many of us have already made the decision...

5519
03:53:30,620 --> 03:53:31,340
To follow him...

5520
03:53:32,120 --> 03:53:33,740
Should that occur...

5521
03:53:33,740 --> 03:53:35,560
But the reason I am writing all of this...

5522
03:53:35,560 --> 03:53:36,340
To you...

5523
03:53:36,340 --> 03:53:37,320
Is that I believe...

5524
03:53:37,320 --> 03:53:38,820
You will help us in the end...

5525
03:53:38,820 --> 03:53:39,840
If for some reason...

5526
03:53:39,840 --> 03:53:42,140
I am no longer able to send letters to thank you...

5527
03:53:42,140 --> 03:53:43,680
I have already instructed a friend...

5528
03:53:43,680 --> 03:53:45,100
To write them on my behalf...

5529
03:53:45,100 --> 03:53:46,320
Please take care of yourself...

5530
03:53:46,320 --> 03:53:47,280
And now and forever...

5531
03:53:47,280 --> 03:53:48,740
You will always have my admiration...

5532
03:53:50,440 --> 03:53:50,860
Yay...

5533
03:53:50,860 --> 03:53:51,600
Thank you...

5534
03:53:51,600 --> 03:53:52,740
You old dragon...

5535
03:53:53,660 --> 03:53:54,080
Alright...

5536
03:53:54,610 --> 03:53:54,820
Sushu...

5537
03:53:54,820 --> 03:53:56,360
I wanna spend a moment with you...

5538
03:53:56,360 --> 03:53:57,760
One last time...

5539
03:53:58,600 --> 03:53:59,020
Whoa...

5540
03:53:59,020 --> 03:54:01,540
You come to the location written at the end of this letter?

5541
03:54:01,540 --> 03:54:03,720
I know that I have no right...

5542
03:54:03,720 --> 03:54:05,640
To be making requests like this...

5543
03:54:05,640 --> 03:54:06,540
But even so...

5544
03:54:07,140 --> 03:54:08,140
Banking is...

5545
03:54:08,140 --> 03:54:09,080
Oh my god...

5546
03:54:09,080 --> 03:54:11,000
He likes to beg...

5547
03:54:11,510 --> 03:54:11,820
Please...

5548
03:54:11,820 --> 03:54:13,200
Give me a chance...

5549
03:54:13,200 --> 03:54:14,710
To make my feelings clear...

5550
03:54:16,060 --> 03:54:16,680
Whoa...

5551
03:54:16,680 --> 03:54:17,570
Okay, buddy...

5552
03:54:18,860 --> 03:54:20,760
I guess we see him...

5553
03:54:20,760 --> 03:54:21,560
Tonight...

5554
03:54:21,560 --> 03:54:23,620
Oh, he's right outside my door...

5555
03:54:23,620 --> 03:54:24,780
Okay, hi...

5556
03:54:26,560 --> 03:54:29,780
He was literally right outside my door...

5557
03:54:35,310 --> 03:54:36,410
You weren't annoyed...

5558
03:54:36,410 --> 03:54:36,770
By...

5559
03:54:36,770 --> 03:54:38,310
Me sending a message...

5560
03:54:39,830 --> 03:54:40,550
But...

5561
03:54:40,550 --> 03:54:43,690
I'm unable to visit you now...

5562
03:54:43,690 --> 03:54:44,510
This...

5563
03:54:44,510 --> 03:54:45,230
Is...

5564
03:54:45,230 --> 03:54:46,310
The only option...

5565
03:54:47,150 --> 03:54:47,870
And...

5566
03:54:47,870 --> 03:54:49,550
I'm grateful you've come...

5567
03:54:53,180 --> 03:54:53,900
Well...

5568
03:54:53,900 --> 03:54:55,240
Don't worry about it...

5569
03:54:55,240 --> 03:54:56,520
I'm glad you seem to be well...

5570
03:54:57,480 --> 03:54:59,260
You're too kind to me...

5571
03:55:00,120 --> 03:55:01,240
After all...

5572
03:55:01,240 --> 03:55:03,420
I may very well become your enemy...

5573
03:55:08,460 --> 03:55:10,040
I knew this the moment...

5574
03:55:10,040 --> 03:55:11,800
I chose to serve Lord Cao Cao...

5575
03:55:13,280 --> 03:55:13,740
But...

5576
03:55:14,540 --> 03:55:15,000
It's...

5577
03:55:15,000 --> 03:55:16,180
Difficult to admit as much...

5578
03:55:16,180 --> 03:55:16,580
Yeah, I mean...

5579
03:55:16,580 --> 03:55:17,600
Thank you for the super chat...

5580
03:55:17,600 --> 03:55:17,940
Thank you...

5581
03:55:17,940 --> 03:55:18,480
Thank you...

5582
03:55:18,480 --> 03:55:19,860
Don't you lost some sub...

5583
03:55:19,860 --> 03:55:21,280
To support the emergency...

5584
03:55:21,280 --> 03:55:22,860
Honey Pop 2 stream...

5585
03:55:23,860 --> 03:55:24,320
Now...

5586
03:55:24,320 --> 03:55:25,080
It's...

5587
03:55:25,080 --> 03:55:27,060
Oh, you should come back...

5588
03:55:27,060 --> 03:55:28,380
I truly would...

5589
03:55:28,380 --> 03:55:29,280
If I could...

5590
03:55:29,280 --> 03:55:30,720
Also, thank you so much for the raid...

5591
03:55:30,720 --> 03:55:32,080
I really appreciate it...

5592
03:55:32,080 --> 03:55:34,200
My heart is resolved on this matter...

5593
03:55:34,200 --> 03:55:37,080
I made the decision after thinking carefully...

5594
03:55:38,140 --> 03:55:41,080
About how I would protect all I hold dear...

5595
03:55:42,680 --> 03:55:44,440
Weighed against the things...

5596
03:55:44,440 --> 03:55:46,180
I could not bear to lose...

5597
03:55:47,560 --> 03:55:49,080
My idealism is...

5598
03:55:51,720 --> 03:55:52,360
Trivial...

5599
03:55:52,360 --> 03:55:53,500
Besides...

5600
03:55:53,500 --> 03:55:55,340
Lord Liu Bei has gained a great ally...

5601
03:55:56,920 --> 03:56:02,060
Zhuge Liang is a once in a generation genius...

5602
03:56:13,440 --> 03:56:14,320
You're sad...

5603
03:56:14,320 --> 03:56:15,980
You're our wingman!

5604
03:56:18,780 --> 03:56:19,740
You're right...

5605
03:56:19,740 --> 03:56:23,620
You sound sad...

5606
03:56:23,620 --> 03:56:24,300
But...

5607
03:56:24,300 --> 03:56:25,940
Thank you...

5608
03:56:25,940 --> 03:56:28,320
For thinking about me...

5609
03:56:28,320 --> 03:56:28,880
Why are you sad?

5610
03:56:29,320 --> 03:56:29,880
Do you remember...

5611
03:56:29,880 --> 03:56:31,760
I told you...

5612
03:56:31,760 --> 03:56:32,040
I can be sad...

5613
03:56:32,040 --> 03:56:33,140
To be myself around you...

5614
03:56:33,140 --> 03:56:33,400
Yeah?

5615
03:56:33,920 --> 03:56:36,020
A lot of them say that to me...

5616
03:56:36,020 --> 03:56:36,040
So today...

5617
03:56:36,040 --> 03:56:37,040
I wanted to make sure...

5618
03:56:39,280 --> 03:56:40,400
To confirm...

5619
03:56:40,400 --> 03:56:42,040
That I had made the correct decision...

5620
03:56:42,620 --> 03:56:44,440
Now kiss...

5621
03:56:44,440 --> 03:56:44,460
And now...

5622
03:56:44,460 --> 03:56:46,920
Here before the one I admire so deeply...

5623
03:56:48,040 --> 03:56:48,600
Whoa!

5624
03:56:49,840 --> 03:56:50,400
Whoa!

5625
03:56:50,400 --> 03:56:52,600
Would you mind if I ended with a selfish request?

5626
03:56:53,140 --> 03:56:53,720
What's the...

5627
03:56:53,720 --> 03:56:53,900
Whoa!

5628
03:56:54,660 --> 03:56:55,600
I want you...

5629
03:56:56,580 --> 03:56:57,700
To remember...

5630
03:56:57,700 --> 03:57:00,100
That you met a good-natured...

5631
03:57:00,100 --> 03:57:01,100
Naive...

5632
03:57:01,920 --> 03:57:02,390
Man...

5633
03:57:03,780 --> 03:57:04,250
Called...

5634
03:57:05,700 --> 03:57:06,640
Shishu...

5635
03:57:06,640 --> 03:57:08,550
Though the good times were brief...

5636
03:57:09,100 --> 03:57:11,310
And we parted ways in the end...

5637
03:57:12,460 --> 03:57:15,260
Remember that I strove alongside you...

5638
03:57:15,260 --> 03:57:15,980
And...

5639
03:57:15,980 --> 03:57:17,330
More to your very selfish...

5640
03:57:17,920 --> 03:57:18,320
Desire?

5641
03:57:19,320 --> 03:57:20,260
Uh...

5642
03:57:21,100 --> 03:57:25,310
Why was there a pause after I want you...

5643
03:57:26,380 --> 03:57:27,000
Whoa!

5644
03:57:27,000 --> 03:57:28,400
And one day...

5645
03:57:29,200 --> 03:57:31,080
Even if we've become enemies...

5646
03:57:31,080 --> 03:57:33,660
He's gonna remember me for the rest of his life, guys...

5647
03:57:33,660 --> 03:57:35,320
I leave that type of impact...

5648
03:57:35,320 --> 03:57:37,000
I may not be a person of great talent...

5649
03:57:37,520 --> 03:57:39,180
Or skill...

5650
03:57:39,180 --> 03:57:42,020
But my resolve in this...

5651
03:57:42,020 --> 03:57:44,000
Is unmatched...

5652
03:57:46,600 --> 03:57:47,120
Bye!

5653
03:57:49,580 --> 03:57:50,460
Wait, no!

5654
03:57:50,460 --> 03:57:50,540
No!

5655
03:57:51,250 --> 03:57:52,520
We could do more!

5656
03:57:55,180 --> 03:57:58,620
Do you have any other requests you would like to make?

5657
03:58:08,390 --> 03:58:11,140
I'm all prepared and ready to go...

5658
03:58:11,370 --> 03:58:14,810
I think I'm getting used to abandoning castles and running away...

5659
03:58:16,920 --> 03:58:18,680
I am sorry...

5660
03:58:19,940 --> 03:58:23,500
My stubbornness just keeps causing more trouble...

5661
03:58:23,500 --> 03:58:26,000
He was just too shy to ask...

5662
03:58:26,000 --> 03:58:27,080
You will not worry, brother...

5663
03:58:27,520 --> 03:58:29,860
All we need to do is survive...

5664
03:58:29,860 --> 03:58:31,680
Just like we've always done...

5665
03:58:34,400 --> 03:58:35,800
We will protect you...

5666
03:58:36,640 --> 03:58:37,240
Right...

5667
03:58:37,240 --> 03:58:40,340
We will protect you and your family with every bit of our strength...

5668
03:58:40,340 --> 03:58:41,320
Also, guys...

5669
03:58:41,320 --> 03:58:42,820
I just realized...

5670
03:58:42,820 --> 03:58:43,940
I suppose I can't...

5671
03:58:43,940 --> 03:58:45,060
How close are we...

5672
03:58:45,060 --> 03:58:46,080
To finishing this game...

5673
03:58:46,560 --> 03:58:47,280
Especially with my brothers...

5674
03:58:47,280 --> 03:58:48,860
I think I was a little too overcome...

5675
03:58:51,080 --> 03:58:52,360
Because I know...

5676
03:58:52,360 --> 03:58:54,060
We have the battle of QB...

5677
03:58:55,360 --> 03:58:55,880
In...

5678
03:58:55,880 --> 03:58:57,060
For the Shu Kingdom...

5679
03:58:58,000 --> 03:58:58,740
But like...

5680
03:58:58,740 --> 03:59:00,880
It feels like we're not close to it...

5681
03:59:02,140 --> 03:59:03,720
Okay, we have three more battles...

5682
03:59:03,720 --> 03:59:04,580
I was gonna say...

5683
03:59:04,580 --> 03:59:07,860
I feel like we're not close to the battle of QB yet...

5684
03:59:08,700 --> 03:59:09,220
Like...

5685
03:59:09,220 --> 03:59:10,400
Ha ha ha ha ha...

5686
03:59:16,600 --> 03:59:17,240
My lord...

5687
03:59:18,100 --> 03:59:19,180
My lord...

5688
03:59:19,180 --> 03:59:23,440
I'm grateful to see you...

5689
03:59:24,240 --> 03:59:26,040
Some of the peasants here...

5690
03:59:26,040 --> 03:59:28,240
Escaped from Cao Cao's invading forces...

5691
03:59:28,240 --> 03:59:28,980
Oh...

5692
03:59:28,980 --> 03:59:30,180
Others...

5693
03:59:30,180 --> 03:59:32,100
Barred from their castle...

5694
03:59:32,100 --> 03:59:32,120
Look...

5695
03:59:32,120 --> 03:59:33,240
There's the children...

5696
03:59:34,160 --> 03:59:36,160
They've endured much...

5697
03:59:36,160 --> 03:59:37,160
Difficulty...

5698
03:59:37,160 --> 03:59:39,540
They've nowhere else to turn...

5699
03:59:40,080 --> 03:59:42,580
We humbly ask for your guidance...

5700
03:59:42,580 --> 03:59:44,220
Don't worry, I'm here now...

5701
03:59:44,220 --> 03:59:45,360
Benevolence...

5702
03:59:45,360 --> 03:59:45,940
Benevolence...

5703
03:59:45,940 --> 03:59:46,600
Benevolence...

5704
03:59:46,600 --> 03:59:46,740
Benevolence...

5705
03:59:46,740 --> 03:59:49,400
Now clap...

5706
03:59:49,400 --> 03:59:50,660
Bringing them along...

5707
03:59:50,660 --> 03:59:50,940
Would...

5708
03:59:50,940 --> 03:59:52,100
Inevitably...

5709
03:59:52,100 --> 03:59:54,220
Slow our march's pace...

5710
03:59:55,120 --> 03:59:55,900
I know we brought...

5711
03:59:55,900 --> 03:59:56,740
I know in the books...

5712
03:59:56,740 --> 03:59:58,220
We brought them along...

5713
03:59:59,500 --> 04:00:01,360
Cao Cao's forces are unlikely...

5714
04:00:01,360 --> 04:00:02,500
To raise a hand to peasants...

5715
04:00:02,500 --> 04:00:03,410
Who have shown no resistance...

5716
04:00:08,440 --> 04:00:09,020
Hmm...

5717
04:00:09,020 --> 04:00:09,840
Zhuge Liang...

5718
04:00:10,700 --> 04:00:12,840
The Longzong plan required...

5719
04:00:12,840 --> 04:00:15,030
The acquisition of Jing province...

5720
04:00:27,410 --> 04:00:29,810
I have a speech to make...

5721
04:00:29,810 --> 04:00:30,770
And now...

5722
04:00:30,770 --> 04:00:33,550
I have taken Jing province...

5723
04:00:37,170 --> 04:00:39,190
It would be truly strange...

5724
04:00:39,190 --> 04:00:41,690
To suggest relinquishing it now...

5725
04:00:48,120 --> 04:00:49,200
My apologies...

5726
04:00:50,240 --> 04:00:51,000
Oh my god...

5727
04:00:51,000 --> 04:00:51,620
Is he proud of me...

5728
04:00:51,620 --> 04:00:52,080
Or disappointed?

5729
04:00:52,340 --> 04:00:53,240
I can't tell...

5730
04:00:54,680 --> 04:00:55,560
Like I...

5731
04:00:55,560 --> 04:00:57,180
Lupe does so much of both...

5732
04:00:57,180 --> 04:00:57,220
Indeed...

5733
04:00:57,220 --> 04:00:58,640
A kingdom is more than land...

5734
04:00:59,200 --> 04:01:01,320
It is those who call it home...

5735
04:01:01,320 --> 04:01:05,280
Who are truly vital...

5736
04:01:05,280 --> 04:01:06,340
And you have indeed...

5737
04:01:07,540 --> 04:01:09,360
Taken Jing province...

5738
04:01:09,360 --> 04:01:10,700
Hehehehe...

5739
04:01:10,700 --> 04:01:11,160
So...

5740
04:01:11,160 --> 04:01:13,420
Let us combine our abilities...

5741
04:01:13,420 --> 04:01:14,360
To overcome hardship...

5742
04:01:14,900 --> 04:01:15,500
And discover...

5743
04:01:15,900 --> 04:01:17,360
The way forward...

5744
04:01:19,280 --> 04:01:20,580
To your kingdom...

5745
04:01:21,400 --> 04:01:22,220
Lord Liu...

5746
04:01:22,220 --> 04:01:22,720
Oh my god...

5747
04:01:22,720 --> 04:01:23,560
My shoe kingdom...

5748
04:01:24,060 --> 04:01:24,440
Yes...

5749
04:01:25,100 --> 04:01:25,480
Finally...

5750
04:01:25,480 --> 04:01:27,540
I can stop running away...

5751
04:01:27,540 --> 04:01:28,980
Forgive me everyone...

5752
04:01:30,460 --> 04:01:31,220
I...

5753
04:01:31,220 --> 04:01:33,360
Wish for them to accompany us...

5754
04:01:34,660 --> 04:01:35,420
That...

5755
04:01:35,420 --> 04:01:37,680
Is my desire...

5756
04:01:44,170 --> 04:01:44,650
Finally...

5757
04:01:44,650 --> 04:01:45,670
We have a home...

5758
04:01:47,170 --> 04:01:48,510
Lupe's history of kindness...

5759
04:01:48,510 --> 04:01:49,050
Was repaid...

5760
04:01:49,050 --> 04:01:50,310
As soldiers and peasants alike...

5761
04:01:50,310 --> 04:01:51,950
Joined his fleeing flock...

5762
04:01:51,950 --> 04:01:53,070
Their flight to the south...

5763
04:01:53,070 --> 04:01:54,090
Was a slow one...

5764
04:01:54,090 --> 04:01:55,230
And soon they found themselves...

5765
04:01:55,230 --> 04:01:55,810
Able to hear...

5766
04:01:55,810 --> 04:01:57,030
The stomping feet...

5767
04:01:57,030 --> 04:01:58,390
Of Cao Cao's forces...

5768
04:01:58,390 --> 04:02:00,950
Catching up to them...

5769
04:02:01,830 --> 04:02:04,090
Our advance is far too slow...

5770
04:02:04,550 --> 04:02:06,030
We need to put some distance...

5771
04:02:06,030 --> 04:02:08,110
Between us and Cao Cao's forces...

5772
04:02:08,110 --> 04:02:09,230
But at this rate...

5773
04:02:09,230 --> 04:02:10,430
They'll catch up to us...

5774
04:02:11,230 --> 04:02:12,370
The cause...

5775
04:02:12,370 --> 04:02:13,230
Is fairly obvious...

5776
04:02:14,070 --> 04:02:15,270
I cannot just leave...

5777
04:02:15,270 --> 04:02:16,320
Those who came to me...

5778
04:02:16,830 --> 04:02:18,470
Seeking help...

5779
04:02:18,470 --> 04:02:19,210
Yes...

5780
04:02:19,210 --> 04:02:20,150
I understand that...

5781
04:02:20,150 --> 04:02:21,460
Yeah, this is the famous retweet...

5782
04:02:21,850 --> 04:02:22,330
And it is my job...

5783
04:02:22,330 --> 04:02:23,270
To do something about...

5784
04:02:23,270 --> 04:02:24,230
Our current predicament...

5785
04:02:27,650 --> 04:02:28,810
Well said...

5786
04:02:28,810 --> 04:02:31,610
I will now head to Jiangxia...

5787
04:02:32,410 --> 04:02:33,850
The governor there...

5788
04:02:33,850 --> 04:02:35,350
Lord Liu Qi...

5789
04:02:35,350 --> 04:02:35,970
Owes me a favor...

5790
04:02:35,970 --> 04:02:36,970
It's time for...

5791
04:02:36,970 --> 04:02:37,610
Jiangfei...

5792
04:02:37,610 --> 04:02:39,130
To guard the bridge...

5793
04:02:39,130 --> 04:02:40,310
This is the bridge scene...

5794
04:02:40,310 --> 04:02:40,390
Right?

5795
04:02:40,770 --> 04:02:41,870
From Jiangfei?

5796
04:02:42,850 --> 04:02:44,550
Just what kind of scheme...

5797
04:02:44,550 --> 04:02:45,150
Did you pull?

5798
04:02:47,150 --> 04:02:47,750
Oh...

5799
04:02:47,750 --> 04:02:49,970
It was nothing really...

5800
04:02:50,770 --> 04:02:52,170
Lord Guan Yu...

5801
04:02:52,730 --> 04:02:53,870
I would like you to...

5802
04:02:53,870 --> 04:02:54,970
Accompany me to Jiangxia...

5803
04:02:56,030 --> 04:02:57,250
See, I'm not a fake fan...

5804
04:02:57,250 --> 04:02:59,910
I played all the Dynasty Warriors...

5805
04:02:59,910 --> 04:03:00,470
And return to...

5806
04:03:00,470 --> 04:03:02,590
And I will continue playing more...

5807
04:03:02,590 --> 04:03:03,630
Hehehehe...

5808
04:03:03,630 --> 04:03:04,250
Zhao Fei...

5809
04:03:04,850 --> 04:03:05,730
Zhao Yun...

5810
04:03:05,990 --> 04:03:07,250
Take care of Liu Bei...

5811
04:03:07,250 --> 04:03:08,250
Until I return...

5812
04:03:08,850 --> 04:03:10,410
They can remake this game...

5813
04:03:10,410 --> 04:03:11,190
200 times...

5814
04:03:11,190 --> 04:03:12,310
And I'll still buy it...

5815
04:03:12,310 --> 04:03:13,250
With my life...

5816
04:03:14,270 --> 04:03:15,470
Thank you...

5817
04:03:15,470 --> 04:03:17,230
All of you...

5818
04:03:17,230 --> 04:03:19,250
My life is in your hands...

5819
04:03:21,710 --> 04:03:23,250
God's strongest consumer...

5820
04:03:25,110 --> 04:03:25,440
Hehehehe...

5821
04:03:25,770 --> 04:03:27,540
I will play the same story...

5822
04:03:27,910 --> 04:03:29,500
Over and over again...

5823
04:03:38,710 --> 04:03:39,370
Hehehehe...

5824
04:03:39,370 --> 04:03:40,130
There you are...

5825
04:03:40,130 --> 04:03:40,610
Zuluan...

5826
04:03:41,130 --> 04:03:43,890
I see you are still with Liu Bei...

5827
04:03:43,890 --> 04:03:47,050
Assisting him in his struggle to stop Cao Cao...

5828
04:03:47,050 --> 04:03:48,670
That is good...

5829
04:03:48,670 --> 04:03:50,670
The incense calls for me...

5830
04:03:50,670 --> 04:03:51,490
Going on...

5831
04:03:51,490 --> 04:03:53,510
What is Liu Bei...

5832
04:03:53,510 --> 04:03:54,410
Trying to do...

5833
04:03:54,410 --> 04:03:57,150
By taking this many commoners with him...

5834
04:03:57,150 --> 04:03:57,690
As he flees...

5835
04:04:01,910 --> 04:04:04,570
Trying to follow his ideas...

5836
04:04:04,570 --> 04:04:04,970
What...

5837
04:04:04,970 --> 04:04:07,950
Do you mean that he would risk the lives of the people...

5838
04:04:07,950 --> 04:04:09,610
For something so abstract?

5839
04:04:10,570 --> 04:04:12,070
Whatever his reason is...

5840
04:04:12,570 --> 04:04:15,590
This will most likely end in a great deal of casualties...

5841
04:04:15,590 --> 04:04:16,790
We've killed so many!

5842
04:04:17,450 --> 04:04:19,050
Why would we not run and leave the people behind?

5843
04:04:19,970 --> 04:04:22,650
If we leave them behind then she'll all still die!

5844
04:04:24,790 --> 04:04:26,330
And why would they...

5845
04:04:26,330 --> 04:04:28,570
Not try to leave Liu Bei?

5846
04:04:29,330 --> 04:04:33,850
This many individuals displaying such loyalty to one man...

5847
04:04:33,850 --> 04:04:36,010
At the risk of their own lives...

5848
04:04:36,010 --> 04:04:38,310
I don't believe Cao Cao would...

5849
04:04:38,970 --> 04:04:39,290
Like...

5850
04:04:39,290 --> 04:04:41,890
I don't believe Cao Cao would like...

5851
04:04:41,890 --> 04:04:44,050
Be nice to the peasants too...

5852
04:04:44,590 --> 04:04:46,050
I don't believe it...

5853
04:04:47,050 --> 04:04:47,730
It...

5854
04:04:47,730 --> 04:04:48,530
This proves that...

5855
04:04:48,530 --> 04:04:50,190
I believe he'll become a hero...

5856
04:04:50,190 --> 04:04:51,370
I say as I'm in denial...

5857
04:04:52,030 --> 04:04:52,110
What?

5858
04:04:54,230 --> 04:04:55,930
Spreading his beliefs...

5859
04:04:55,930 --> 04:04:58,050
And dragging his people into war...

5860
04:04:58,990 --> 04:04:59,670
Huh...

5861
04:04:59,670 --> 04:05:03,850
I suppose that is befitting of what people usually call...

5862
04:05:03,850 --> 04:05:05,210
A hero...

5863
04:05:05,210 --> 04:05:08,230
And as with all so-called heroes...

5864
04:05:08,230 --> 04:05:10,350
Wherever Liu Bei goes...

5865
04:05:10,790 --> 04:05:12,310
Destruction and violence follow...

5866
04:05:12,970 --> 04:05:16,470
No matter the words they use to glorify their cause...

5867
04:05:17,050 --> 04:05:18,510
In the end...

5868
04:05:18,510 --> 04:05:22,030
Each of them sacrifices people for their goals...

5869
04:05:22,030 --> 04:05:24,570
And judging from how dire this current situation is...

5870
04:05:25,950 --> 04:05:27,090
Perhaps he...

5871
04:05:27,090 --> 04:05:28,390
No he is...

5872
04:05:29,110 --> 04:05:31,790
I feel like a lot of these generals and strategists...

5873
04:05:31,790 --> 04:05:32,550
Would like...

5874
04:05:32,550 --> 04:05:33,910
Have better lives...

5875
04:05:33,910 --> 04:05:35,310
If they didn't follow Liu Bei...

5876
04:05:35,310 --> 04:05:37,710
What will Liu Bei do now?

5877
04:05:38,410 --> 04:05:39,630
Cling on to his conviction...

5878
04:05:39,630 --> 04:05:40,670
Like it's so sad...

5879
04:05:40,670 --> 04:05:41,310
Jukot Lun...

5880
04:05:41,310 --> 04:05:42,950
Had his peak in...

5881
04:05:42,950 --> 04:05:44,590
The battle of Red Cliff...

5882
04:05:44,590 --> 04:05:46,590
And then everything went downhill...

5883
04:05:46,590 --> 04:05:48,170
And every strategy he had...

5884
04:05:48,170 --> 04:05:49,750
Was just failing...

5885
04:05:50,150 --> 04:05:50,470
Over...

5886
04:05:50,470 --> 04:05:51,530
And over...

5887
04:05:51,530 --> 04:05:53,170
And over again...

5888
04:05:53,170 --> 04:05:55,310
It was so sad...

5889
04:05:58,120 --> 04:05:59,060
I'll never...

5890
04:05:59,060 --> 04:05:59,640
I would never...

5891
04:05:59,640 --> 04:06:00,140
Sorry...

5892
04:06:00,140 --> 04:06:00,440
I...

5893
04:06:00,440 --> 04:06:02,120
I didn't mean that...

5894
04:06:02,120 --> 04:06:03,000
I didn't mean that...

5895
04:06:03,000 --> 04:06:04,140
You're always a genius...

5896
04:06:04,660 --> 04:06:05,140
Maoshi...

5897
04:06:05,140 --> 04:06:05,660
I...

5898
04:06:05,660 --> 04:06:07,220
I was just telling them a lie...

5899
04:06:10,180 --> 04:06:12,340
Why don't you rest your wings...

5900
04:06:12,340 --> 04:06:13,120
A lot longer...

5901
04:06:13,780 --> 04:06:16,380
I want you to chase down the enemy quickly...

5902
04:06:16,380 --> 04:06:17,180
Will you do it?

5903
04:06:18,300 --> 04:06:19,060
Wait, what?

5904
04:06:19,380 --> 04:06:20,100
Is it this?

5905
04:06:21,420 --> 04:06:23,080
Carry out requests to chase down...

5906
04:06:23,080 --> 04:06:24,200
Alright, I'm gonna use the bathroom...

5907
04:06:24,200 --> 04:06:24,820
Real quick...

5908
04:06:24,820 --> 04:06:26,120
I'll be right back guys...

5909
04:07:47,640 --> 04:07:48,820
I got more water...

5910
04:07:49,800 --> 04:07:50,620
Sajan, thank you...

5911
04:07:50,620 --> 04:07:51,780
Sajan and Mehdi...

5912
04:07:51,780 --> 04:07:53,140
Thank you for the super chat...

5913
04:07:53,140 --> 04:07:54,240
Thank you, thank you...

5914
04:07:54,240 --> 04:07:56,980
Oh yeah, let me check when my lasagna gets here...

5915
04:07:56,980 --> 04:07:58,820
And we'll have a little food break too...

5916
04:08:01,600 --> 04:08:02,000
Lasagna...

5917
04:08:02,000 --> 04:08:03,460
Yummy, yummy...

5918
04:08:03,460 --> 04:08:04,720
Okay, 20 minutes...

5919
04:08:05,180 --> 04:08:05,580
Okay...

5920
04:08:05,580 --> 04:08:07,820
We'll get our lasagna in 20 minutes...

5921
04:08:08,800 --> 04:08:09,460
Next seat...

5922
04:08:09,460 --> 04:08:10,460
Thank you for the super chat...

5923
04:08:10,460 --> 04:08:11,820
Thank you, thank you...

5924
04:08:12,460 --> 04:08:13,820
Can't wait for lasagna...

5925
04:08:17,220 --> 04:08:18,180
Okay, what do I have to do?

5926
04:08:19,060 --> 04:08:22,300
Oh, I have to make sure they don't... Don't worry, I can do that.

5927
04:08:24,740 --> 04:08:25,580
I'll just run.

5928
04:08:27,220 --> 04:08:29,820
There we go.

5929
04:08:30,360 --> 04:08:30,980
That was easy.

5930
04:08:33,980 --> 04:08:34,880
Let me just run.

5931
04:08:37,640 --> 04:08:39,280
Like, he just wants to fight me.

5932
04:08:39,500 --> 04:08:40,480
I don't have to do anything.

5933
04:08:44,240 --> 04:08:44,760
Boom.

5934
04:08:45,300 --> 04:08:45,740
Okay.

5935
04:08:47,720 --> 04:08:49,280
Okay, this is a little bad, though.

5936
04:08:51,680 --> 04:08:52,520
Okay, nice.

5937
04:08:56,530 --> 04:08:57,350
Oh, nice.

5938
04:08:58,550 --> 04:08:59,430
Don't worry.

5939
04:09:01,210 --> 04:09:02,330
Oh, shit.

5940
04:09:02,530 --> 04:09:03,210
Okay, maybe worried.

5941
04:09:03,430 --> 04:09:04,390
Oh, okay, sorry.

5942
04:09:05,870 --> 04:09:06,390
Whoops.

5943
04:09:07,610 --> 04:09:07,850
Oh, no.

5944
04:09:09,050 --> 04:09:09,570
Man!

5945
04:09:11,810 --> 04:09:14,210
If all else fails, I have to spin!

5946
04:09:18,070 --> 04:09:20,510
Okay, I should have definitely been holding my attacks more.

5947
04:09:20,670 --> 04:09:22,710
That's actually so strong!

5948
04:09:23,490 --> 04:09:24,730
I did it, though!

5949
04:09:31,190 --> 04:09:32,150
Spin the wind.

5950
04:09:32,450 --> 04:09:33,210
All right, he's one hit.

5951
04:09:35,330 --> 04:09:36,770
Okay, I'll just do the last spin.

5952
04:09:37,270 --> 04:09:38,150
I should kill him.

5953
04:09:39,030 --> 04:09:39,350
Yeah!

5954
04:09:39,350 --> 04:09:39,490
Yeah!

5955
04:09:40,370 --> 04:09:42,430
The enemy officer has been defeated.

5956
04:09:43,330 --> 04:09:45,610
Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da!

5957
04:09:47,010 --> 04:09:49,330
All right, so I was debuffing myself.

5958
04:09:49,570 --> 04:09:53,170
I was actually playing with weights on for that.

5959
04:09:55,990 --> 04:09:57,950
Causing debris to rain down, strike enemies.

5960
04:09:58,110 --> 04:09:59,870
Debris will also hit, but can be injured.

5961
04:10:00,730 --> 04:10:02,150
Wait, do I hit myself?

5962
04:10:02,230 --> 04:10:03,450
No, okay, I don't hit myself.

5963
04:10:03,450 --> 04:10:04,650
Okay, I got a little worried.

5964
04:10:05,350 --> 04:10:08,470
I thought it would be like, why are you hitting yourself type deal.

5965
04:10:10,550 --> 04:10:11,510
Okay, nice.

5966
04:10:14,830 --> 04:10:16,030
Okay, I did it.

5967
04:10:16,310 --> 04:10:17,630
Will you leave your wife now?

5968
04:10:19,770 --> 04:10:20,330
Yes.

5969
04:10:24,650 --> 04:10:25,210
Really?

5970
04:10:27,370 --> 04:10:30,990
It's good to have trustworthy fellows like you.

5971
04:10:31,210 --> 04:10:32,330
He said yes, guys!

5972
04:10:32,850 --> 04:10:34,330
Like you close that ass.

5973
04:10:34,910 --> 04:10:38,870
Thanks to you, the sleeping dragon's first battle and victory.

5974
04:10:39,550 --> 04:10:43,250
The soldiers I sent you to chase were survivors fleeing from my last battle.

5975
04:10:43,790 --> 04:10:44,710
How'd they escape?

5976
04:10:44,990 --> 04:10:48,370
I had to give up my title and run scoring back into the mountains.

5977
04:10:49,030 --> 04:10:50,390
Okay, thank you for the super chat.

5978
04:10:50,530 --> 04:10:50,750
Thank you.

5979
04:10:50,890 --> 04:10:51,510
Thank you.

5980
04:10:52,450 --> 04:10:53,450
I'm Doakfield.

5981
04:10:54,290 --> 04:10:56,910
How where I have grown, I don't suppose I could rest...

5982
04:10:56,910 --> 04:10:57,130
Oh!

5983
04:10:58,530 --> 04:10:59,030
Yes!

5984
04:10:59,590 --> 04:11:00,090
Yes!

5985
04:11:03,890 --> 04:11:07,870
I don't suppose I could rest at your place.

5986
04:11:09,350 --> 04:11:09,850
Oh!

5987
04:11:14,230 --> 04:11:16,130
Wait, is he going to give me a concierge?

5988
04:11:18,050 --> 04:11:21,110
Well, if you want to sit, I'm kicking my feet right now.

5989
04:11:21,620 --> 04:11:23,270
Everything you need is close at hand.

5990
04:11:23,450 --> 04:11:24,870
Quite like the mountain retreat.

5991
04:11:26,750 --> 04:11:28,070
Ah, pardon me.

5992
04:11:29,190 --> 04:11:36,630
To appear out of the blue and immediately comment on the state of your residence, I must be more exhausted than I thought.

5993
04:11:39,490 --> 04:11:41,030
Why are you so tired?

5994
04:11:41,670 --> 04:11:47,170
An actual battlefield is nothing like the assumptions and analyses one makes...

5995
04:11:47,170 --> 04:11:47,790
No!

5996
04:11:48,730 --> 04:11:51,230
He has a wife, Doakfield!

5997
04:11:52,930 --> 04:11:57,030
Before he departed, Shishu saw to it that my abilities were known to many.

5998
04:11:57,070 --> 04:11:59,710
Because, thank you for the super sticker.

5999
04:12:00,010 --> 04:12:00,830
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

6000
04:12:01,350 --> 04:12:01,510
Yum!

6001
04:12:04,570 --> 04:12:06,850
Entreating me to become his strategist.

6002
04:12:07,790 --> 04:12:09,450
This is also known to many.

6003
04:12:09,710 --> 04:12:11,310
Lupu didn't stop her.

6004
04:12:11,510 --> 04:12:11,990
Why stop now?

6005
04:12:11,990 --> 04:12:16,730
I had to take advantage of the situation and play the part of a genius with God-given wisdom.

6006
04:12:17,750 --> 04:12:21,350
That is how I will demonstrate to friend and foe alike.

6007
04:12:21,690 --> 04:12:27,970
Oh, yeah, you saw the doll that his wife made with very accurate proportions and anatomy.

6008
04:12:28,270 --> 04:12:37,230
In order for Lord Liu Bei to stand out among his rival warlords, I must make it known that he has indeed gotten his hands on a rare resource.

6009
04:12:41,030 --> 04:12:42,310
You thought this through.

6010
04:12:42,310 --> 04:12:43,110
But, of course.

6011
04:12:43,810 --> 04:12:46,350
What else would one expect from a tactician?

6012
04:12:47,710 --> 04:12:54,970
Though today was my first foray into warfare, it would not do for me to appear unnerved by the experience.

6013
04:12:56,670 --> 04:12:59,550
In reality, it was highly stressful.

6014
04:13:00,710 --> 04:13:03,950
I am simply pleased that everything turned out well in the end.

6015
04:13:04,370 --> 04:13:06,950
The deeds done this day were a great help.

6016
04:13:06,950 --> 04:13:09,230
I speak of Lord Guan Yu.

6017
04:13:09,710 --> 04:13:10,830
Lord Zhang Fei.

6018
04:13:11,450 --> 04:13:12,550
Lord Zhao Yun.

6019
04:13:13,430 --> 04:13:14,870
And you, of course.

6020
04:13:15,130 --> 04:13:15,590
Of me!

6021
04:13:15,810 --> 04:13:16,650
He said me!

6022
04:13:16,910 --> 04:13:17,530
I exist!

6023
04:13:18,510 --> 04:13:19,970
You flatter me.

6024
04:13:20,470 --> 04:13:21,770
Third, they give the super chat.

6025
04:13:21,910 --> 04:13:22,730
Thank you, thank you.

6026
04:13:22,890 --> 04:13:23,790
Take his wife then.

6027
04:13:23,910 --> 04:13:24,430
Take him.

6028
04:13:24,630 --> 04:13:26,970
It's a strategy with no flaws.

6029
04:13:27,650 --> 04:13:28,790
No one is safe.

6030
04:13:29,290 --> 04:13:32,090
Though a tactician should play their cards close to the chest.

6031
04:13:32,690 --> 04:13:35,150
I assure you that this sentence comes from the heart.

6032
04:13:35,230 --> 04:13:35,730
It's from his heart.

6033
04:13:35,730 --> 04:13:36,450
He noticed me, guys.

6034
04:13:36,650 --> 04:13:37,450
It's from his heart.

6035
04:13:37,610 --> 04:13:40,570
Shall I explain why you alone are privy to these thoughts?

6036
04:13:41,190 --> 04:13:41,510
Yeah?

6037
04:13:41,790 --> 04:13:43,510
You want me to sit right next to you?

6038
04:13:43,750 --> 04:13:45,970
It is true that I consider you an excellent asset.

6039
04:13:47,430 --> 04:13:48,810
With our knees touching?

6040
04:13:49,130 --> 04:13:51,290
I wish to expand your utility further.

6041
04:13:51,890 --> 04:13:52,710
His heart!

6042
04:13:53,670 --> 04:13:55,850
You have sampled my vegetables, yes?

6043
04:13:56,630 --> 04:14:01,830
Then you well know my predilection for items with profound zest and a palpable bite.

6044
04:14:02,970 --> 04:14:05,690
May our fellowship be long and fruitful.

6045
04:14:06,630 --> 04:14:12,910
I might not mind this traipse through the muck and mire with one such as you by his side.

6046
04:14:12,910 --> 04:14:14,490
Black guy gets to be by his side, guys.

6047
04:14:15,350 --> 04:14:16,530
He's accepted me.

6048
04:14:16,710 --> 04:14:16,870
No!

6049
04:14:17,050 --> 04:14:17,690
Don't fade him!

6050
04:14:17,830 --> 04:14:18,070
Black!

6051
04:14:18,550 --> 04:14:19,610
I want to go, boy!

6052
04:14:23,630 --> 04:14:25,750
Why did they fade him, Black?

6053
04:14:26,110 --> 04:14:27,530
Tell me, boy!

6054
04:14:28,790 --> 04:14:31,390
Whispers sweet tacticians!

6055
04:14:31,390 --> 04:14:32,790
It's in my ear!

6056
04:14:35,910 --> 04:14:37,070
Go back!

6057
04:14:40,750 --> 04:14:44,690
Whisper the strategies you're gonna use to defeat Tau Tau.

6058
04:14:44,930 --> 04:14:46,310
We wanna know!

6059
04:14:46,910 --> 04:14:48,950
We just wanna know!

6060
04:14:55,280 --> 04:14:58,080
This is the gameplay I showed up for.

6061
04:15:01,120 --> 04:15:02,340
Okay, let's see.

6062
04:15:04,420 --> 04:15:06,820
I just wanna make sure we're not missing anything.

6063
04:15:07,760 --> 04:15:08,750
I wanna see if there's...

6064
04:15:09,440 --> 04:15:10,860
anybody we need to talk to.

6065
04:15:11,680 --> 04:15:14,040
Being hungry keeps you in low spirits.

6066
04:15:14,400 --> 04:15:15,640
Come and grab...

6067
04:15:18,040 --> 04:15:18,640
Oh?

6068
04:15:18,920 --> 04:15:19,520
Oh, okay.

6069
04:15:21,620 --> 04:15:23,480
My god, it's him again?

6070
04:15:24,000 --> 04:15:24,600
I'm...

6071
04:15:27,440 --> 04:15:28,500
I'll just pay.

6072
04:15:29,840 --> 04:15:31,440
Just pay for it.

6073
04:15:31,680 --> 04:15:33,200
I can't be bothered.

6074
04:15:33,500 --> 04:15:33,960
Here, intern.

6075
04:15:34,220 --> 04:15:34,940
Take my money.

6076
04:15:34,940 --> 04:15:35,860
I...

6077
04:15:35,860 --> 04:15:36,340
I...

6078
04:15:36,340 --> 04:15:37,220
I can't be bothered.

6079
04:15:37,980 --> 04:15:40,080
I'll pay the intern, guys.

6080
04:15:43,610 --> 04:15:44,270
Where's it?

6081
04:15:44,310 --> 04:15:44,770
Is he here?

6082
04:15:44,910 --> 04:15:45,630
Okay, there he is.

6083
04:15:49,900 --> 04:15:53,580
Lord Shu Hong occasionally comes by to purchase gifts of appreciation.

6084
04:15:53,580 --> 04:15:55,520
There's, like...

6085
04:15:57,100 --> 04:16:01,000
Oh, wait, there's, like...

6086
04:16:01,000 --> 04:16:02,020
Oh, wait, I have to do this one.

6087
04:16:02,740 --> 04:16:03,300
344.

6088
04:16:04,280 --> 04:16:05,900
Oh, I don't need more guards.

6089
04:16:06,240 --> 04:16:06,700
Who cares?

6090
04:16:06,700 --> 04:16:08,580
Let's go increase our bond.

6091
04:16:08,840 --> 04:16:09,460
I see there's a dragon.

6092
04:16:15,290 --> 04:16:16,670
Hey, there you are.

6093
04:16:17,330 --> 04:16:18,310
Listen to this.

6094
04:16:20,970 --> 04:16:22,090
You seem...

6095
04:16:22,090 --> 04:16:22,150
happy.

6096
04:16:22,710 --> 04:16:23,350
Oh, you know?

6097
04:16:23,790 --> 04:16:25,070
That's our number two.

6098
04:16:25,970 --> 04:16:28,690
Just now, Lord Guan Yu complimented me.

6099
04:16:28,910 --> 04:16:31,270
He said that I'm starting to behave like a real officer.

6100
04:16:31,270 --> 04:16:31,430
What?

6101
04:16:31,650 --> 04:16:33,070
I paid you money!

6102
04:16:33,070 --> 04:16:35,490
Why do you still talk about Guan Yu?

6103
04:16:35,510 --> 04:16:36,230
Don't look at it.

6104
04:16:36,750 --> 04:16:37,310
All my homework is finally taken off.

6105
04:16:37,310 --> 04:16:38,410
I'm right here.

6106
04:16:39,630 --> 04:16:40,190
All my homework is finally taken off.

6107
04:16:40,190 --> 04:16:40,830
All my homework is finally taken off.

6108
04:16:40,830 --> 04:16:44,190
I'm so excited that I've been just raring to tell you ever since.

6109
04:16:48,010 --> 04:16:48,450
Right?

6110
04:16:49,170 --> 04:16:52,090
I knew that you were the one to relish this moment with.

6111
04:16:52,210 --> 04:16:52,910
I'm sad.

6112
04:16:53,370 --> 04:16:56,830
Even with the money I gave him, all he could do is think about him.

6113
04:16:56,830 --> 04:16:59,710
And then one day he might even call me his partner.

6114
04:17:00,890 --> 04:17:03,430
Oh, just thinking about his incredible.

6115
04:17:03,430 --> 04:17:05,450
I'll always be number two, the Guan Yu.

6116
04:17:05,830 --> 04:17:07,770
He's the number one guy until the day I die.

6117
04:17:09,710 --> 04:17:10,930
Until you die.

6118
04:17:11,430 --> 04:17:13,790
I can't see myself serving any other leaders.

6119
04:17:13,790 --> 04:17:14,150
I gave him 8K.

6120
04:17:14,150 --> 04:17:14,290
Hey!

6121
04:17:14,850 --> 04:17:16,590
I work for his lordship alone.

6122
04:17:17,230 --> 04:17:22,150
So that means that as long as I'm alive, I'll be by his side.

6123
04:17:22,990 --> 04:17:29,110
Now, as Lord Guan Yu's number one underling, I have something to tell you, number two.

6124
04:17:29,670 --> 04:17:33,510
Just because you can't be number one, doesn't mean you should quit in despair.

6125
04:17:33,790 --> 04:17:35,410
His loyalty is Oshi.

6126
04:17:35,410 --> 04:17:39,450
I think we would have made a great pair if Fated never brought his lordship and I together.

6127
04:17:40,430 --> 04:17:43,450
So from now on, let's both run where we will.

6128
04:17:43,930 --> 04:17:46,470
I'm like the rebound if he doesn't get Guan Yu.

6129
04:17:51,590 --> 04:17:52,110
Alright.

6130
04:17:52,390 --> 04:17:53,130
That's it?

6131
04:17:53,490 --> 04:17:55,770
All he did was talk about him!

6132
04:17:58,970 --> 04:18:01,030
I can't believe it.

6133
04:18:02,210 --> 04:18:03,450
That's all he did.

6134
04:18:07,710 --> 04:18:09,370
It was 8K!

6135
04:18:15,480 --> 04:18:19,050
Not just because I paid him, but it was 8K!

6136
04:18:21,270 --> 04:18:26,310
We are now entering Cheng Fong with the people from Cheng Province of Toad.

6137
04:18:26,690 --> 04:18:28,730
However, Tao Tao forces have caught up with us.

6138
04:18:29,090 --> 04:18:31,670
Our rear guard are currently in disarray.

6139
04:18:32,170 --> 04:18:33,690
And the formation is faltering.

6140
04:18:34,370 --> 04:18:39,450
I know that I must escape to Jian Xia, but I cannot abandon the civilians and allies who have come with us.

6141
04:18:39,930 --> 04:18:43,310
Yet, if I were to fall here, I would be trained to trust all the same.

6142
04:18:43,690 --> 04:18:48,530
My course is thus, to march forth together, no matter what toil awaits us.

6143
04:18:48,710 --> 04:18:50,190
This is my one and only path.

6144
04:18:50,770 --> 04:18:55,230
What's more, Zhugot Lan and Guan Yun are on their way to Jian Xia to call for reinforcements.

6145
04:18:55,230 --> 04:18:55,730
No!

6146
04:18:57,450 --> 04:19:01,470
I put there in Guan Yun is my trump card every time!

6147
04:19:02,390 --> 04:19:05,450
I just call him in and he kills everything!

6148
04:19:07,230 --> 04:19:13,130
Meanwhile, Zhang Fei is guarding the Changban Bridge to Sarmie Tao Tao's advance.

6149
04:19:13,370 --> 04:19:14,630
What would I do?

6150
04:19:15,790 --> 04:19:17,850
To establish some sort of order.

6151
04:19:18,310 --> 04:19:21,910
Truth in toad, I think it's gone to rescue my family members from the chaos there.

6152
04:19:22,330 --> 04:19:26,210
To be honest, I have no plan, but you always manage to find hope in times of peril.

6153
04:19:26,830 --> 04:19:28,390
Please, find a way through this battle.

6154
04:19:28,810 --> 04:19:32,570
And help our people and allies, alongside Zhang Fei and Zhao Yun.

6155
04:19:33,250 --> 04:19:34,010
Leave it to me.

6156
04:19:35,830 --> 04:19:39,730
Any enemy forces are seemingly endless, for I don't know, we're already cut off.

6157
04:19:40,090 --> 04:19:42,850
But your eyes will be a blessing to accomplish terrain to the self.

6158
04:19:43,630 --> 04:19:47,510
If you read the direction of the wind and find hidden paths for us, you may yet to catch them by surprise.

6159
04:19:48,150 --> 04:19:49,030
You should depart.

6160
04:19:49,470 --> 04:19:51,110
We don't have the luxury of time.

6161
04:19:51,690 --> 04:19:53,910
I'll stay here and rendezvous with our people.

6162
04:19:54,650 --> 04:19:56,390
No, I'm gonna go...

6163
04:19:56,390 --> 04:19:58,090
Wait, I have to be with a companion?

6164
04:20:00,250 --> 04:20:00,850
Uh...

6165
04:20:00,850 --> 04:20:01,930
I'll go with Zhang Fei.

6166
04:20:02,270 --> 04:20:04,630
I like the bridge fight more...

6167
04:20:04,630 --> 04:20:06,190
more than the baby.

6168
04:20:07,150 --> 04:20:07,750
Like...

6169
04:20:07,750 --> 04:20:09,230
Lu Shan is like...

6170
04:20:09,930 --> 04:20:10,530
unsavable.

6171
04:20:11,150 --> 04:20:11,570
So I...

6172
04:20:19,410 --> 04:20:21,410
We don't need Lu Shan.

6173
04:20:23,190 --> 04:20:24,910
If we save him...

6174
04:20:24,910 --> 04:20:26,070
It's just...

6175
04:20:26,070 --> 04:20:26,970
Gonna be...

6176
04:20:26,970 --> 04:20:27,510
Downhill.

6177
04:20:29,630 --> 04:20:30,190
He's...

6178
04:20:30,190 --> 04:20:32,330
We can't fix him anymore.

6179
04:20:32,670 --> 04:20:32,850
What's that?

6180
04:20:33,710 --> 04:20:34,290
Zhang Fei.

6181
04:20:34,890 --> 04:20:35,850
That's Zhang Fei.

6182
04:20:36,490 --> 04:20:37,370
Do not fear.

6183
04:20:37,590 --> 04:20:38,910
That may be Zhang Fei.

6184
04:20:39,270 --> 04:20:40,110
But he is alone.

6185
04:20:40,250 --> 04:20:40,750
We can take him together.

6186
04:20:40,750 --> 04:20:43,230
The bridge fight is much more iconic, though.

6187
04:20:43,350 --> 04:20:44,230
You have to admit.

6188
04:20:45,050 --> 04:20:47,550
There better be tens of thousands of you.

6189
04:20:47,670 --> 04:20:49,710
The bridge fight is much more iconic.

6190
04:20:49,710 --> 04:20:51,330
You are no match for me.

6191
04:20:52,010 --> 04:20:55,230
Now, which one of you wants to die first?

6192
04:20:55,990 --> 04:20:58,090
I'll take you all on at once.

6193
04:21:01,290 --> 04:21:02,390
There you are.

6194
04:21:02,650 --> 04:21:05,650
But now, it's less iconic because there's two of us.

6195
04:21:06,410 --> 04:21:07,170
Here we go.

6196
04:21:07,510 --> 04:21:09,290
It's less impressive now.

6197
04:21:09,410 --> 04:21:11,070
Nobody's getting across this bridge.

6198
04:21:16,500 --> 04:21:19,780
Now that there's two of us, it's not a special.

6199
04:21:28,980 --> 04:21:32,300
You think you can stop us with so few warriors?

6200
04:21:32,800 --> 04:21:33,380
That's true.

6201
04:21:33,500 --> 04:21:39,480
When he comes down, when Zhao Yun comes down with a baby, with a horse and stuff, it is like pretty cool.

6202
04:21:39,680 --> 04:21:42,400
But I still have to say the bridge fight scene is...

6203
04:21:42,400 --> 04:21:43,740
I think it's more memorable.

6204
04:21:44,820 --> 04:21:45,960
In my opinion.

6205
04:21:46,280 --> 04:21:48,720
I'll make sure you fall by my sword.

6206
04:21:49,320 --> 04:21:50,020
With all my might.

6207
04:21:51,340 --> 04:21:51,620
Alright.

6208
04:21:52,140 --> 04:21:54,080
History is ruined now.

6209
04:21:54,460 --> 04:21:54,840
No time to waste on the likes of you.

6210
04:21:55,540 --> 04:21:56,260
Out of our way.

6211
04:21:57,060 --> 04:21:59,580
There are still many left on the other side of the bridge.

6212
04:22:00,880 --> 04:22:04,380
Let us wait here and have faith that they will reach us.

6213
04:22:05,080 --> 04:22:05,700
Get out of here.

6214
04:22:08,300 --> 04:22:10,400
Yeah, they had to write me out of history.

6215
04:22:10,660 --> 04:22:14,360
Because I made Zhao Yun's like cool bridge fight look less cool.

6216
04:22:17,920 --> 04:22:19,250
Um, army of...

6217
04:22:20,000 --> 04:22:20,900
Excuse me?

6218
04:22:21,000 --> 04:22:22,140
I killed him!

6219
04:22:24,700 --> 04:22:26,020
What do you mean?

6220
04:22:30,520 --> 04:22:33,300
You can't just rewrite me now?

6221
04:22:33,680 --> 04:22:35,620
I'm literally right here!

6222
04:22:38,080 --> 04:22:40,620
How did I get rewritten already?

6223
04:22:47,600 --> 04:22:48,560
That's it.

6224
04:22:48,980 --> 04:22:49,980
I'll be jumping.

6225
04:22:50,540 --> 04:22:51,300
That's it.

6226
04:22:51,440 --> 04:22:54,500
If you're gonna rewrite me on History, I'll do it now!

6227
04:22:54,500 --> 04:22:54,900
Wow!

6228
04:23:00,300 --> 04:23:02,600
I might as well be him!

6229
04:23:02,980 --> 04:23:04,780
I might as well!

6230
04:23:06,660 --> 04:23:07,980
What's the point?

6231
04:23:08,800 --> 04:23:11,300
You won't be out anyway!

6232
04:23:16,240 --> 04:23:18,940
Getting ridden out in real time.

6233
04:23:19,360 --> 04:23:20,860
That's rough, buddy.

6234
04:23:25,420 --> 04:23:29,220
Do not underestimate the tenacity of Leo-based forces.

6235
04:23:29,480 --> 04:23:32,020
Show them no mercy and hunt them down.

6236
04:23:34,080 --> 04:23:35,020
Okay, nice.

6237
04:23:42,180 --> 04:23:43,420
That's fucking right!

6238
04:23:43,480 --> 04:23:44,400
I'm coming over here!

6239
04:23:45,560 --> 04:23:46,340
That's right!

6240
04:23:48,880 --> 04:23:50,440
Oh my god, you're all so far!

6241
04:23:55,540 --> 04:23:56,620
Time to attack!

6242
04:23:57,280 --> 04:23:57,580
Okay.

6243
04:24:00,600 --> 04:24:02,180
Not real- Not anymore!

6244
04:24:04,220 --> 04:24:06,620
I'm glad I positioned reinforcements here.

6245
04:24:07,020 --> 04:24:08,500
Cause that man is whirlwind.

6246
04:24:10,440 --> 04:24:11,040
Okay.

6247
04:24:11,960 --> 04:24:13,160
Wait, reinforcements?

6248
04:24:14,080 --> 04:24:14,780
Oh no.

6249
04:24:17,640 --> 04:24:19,340
Okay, good job, Dragoons!

6250
04:24:19,880 --> 04:24:21,320
You distracted- Oh my god!

6251
04:24:23,260 --> 04:24:23,660
Oh my god!

6252
04:24:25,580 --> 04:24:28,920
Oh, I accidentally used my- Oh no, I accidentally used my musu- Oh, it's okay!

6253
04:24:29,300 --> 04:24:29,820
That's good!

6254
04:24:31,640 --> 04:24:34,020
Okay, I thought I fucked up by using my musu here.

6255
04:24:36,520 --> 04:24:37,220
Okay, nice!

6256
04:24:38,140 --> 04:24:38,980
Oh my god!

6257
04:24:39,780 --> 04:24:40,920
Invincibility frames right there?

6258
04:24:42,320 --> 04:24:44,640
The real fight starts now!

6259
04:24:45,360 --> 04:24:46,540
Jesus Christ!

6260
04:24:49,160 --> 04:24:50,140
That's fine?

6261
04:24:50,740 --> 04:24:51,460
Get twirled on?

6262
04:24:51,920 --> 04:24:54,220
The path of justice has fallen before me!

6263
04:24:54,740 --> 04:24:55,220
Oh shit!

6264
04:24:58,200 --> 04:24:58,960
Okay.

6265
04:24:59,760 --> 04:25:00,300
That's fine.

6266
04:25:04,060 --> 04:25:04,820
What?!

6267
04:25:08,720 --> 04:25:10,820
How did he fucking kill me?!

6268
04:25:12,960 --> 04:25:14,260
Oh my god!

6269
04:25:14,440 --> 04:25:15,180
So done us!

6270
04:25:15,680 --> 04:25:15,900
Woo!

6271
04:25:16,720 --> 04:25:18,020
Okay, he just missed.

6272
04:25:18,600 --> 04:25:19,380
That's good.

6273
04:25:19,820 --> 04:25:20,360
That was close.

6274
04:25:24,120 --> 04:25:24,720
Nice.

6275
04:25:25,500 --> 04:25:26,100
Speed!

6276
04:25:28,220 --> 04:25:28,900
That's right!

6277
04:25:28,920 --> 04:25:29,660
Get over here!

6278
04:25:29,840 --> 04:25:30,340
Get closer!

6279
04:25:30,640 --> 04:25:31,260
Get closer!

6280
04:25:31,700 --> 04:25:32,160
Get closer!

6281
04:25:34,560 --> 04:25:35,760
That's so fucked up.

6282
04:25:40,340 --> 04:25:40,860
Please!

6283
04:25:41,020 --> 04:25:42,420
Please don't die yet!

6284
04:25:42,500 --> 04:25:44,120
I'm trying to kill this guy!

6285
04:25:48,080 --> 04:25:48,900
Okay, nice.

6286
04:25:50,220 --> 04:25:51,260
Another one down.

6287
04:25:56,780 --> 04:25:58,100
Okay, last guy.

6288
04:26:00,440 --> 04:26:01,000
Boom!

6289
04:26:06,160 --> 04:26:07,440
Wait, Guan Yin's here!

6290
04:26:08,780 --> 04:26:10,180
Oh no, that's Jean Fei.

6291
04:26:10,440 --> 04:26:10,600
Oops.

6292
04:26:11,140 --> 04:26:12,000
Sorry, I got...

6293
04:26:12,000 --> 04:26:13,400
I thought I saw...

6294
04:26:13,400 --> 04:26:15,140
I thought I saw...

6295
04:26:16,440 --> 04:26:18,520
I thought I saw, you know...

6296
04:26:19,540 --> 04:26:20,600
The red hair.

6297
04:26:22,180 --> 04:26:23,220
Oh hey, it's Yao Yin!

6298
04:26:23,540 --> 04:26:24,440
Did you get the baby?

6299
04:26:28,650 --> 04:26:29,750
Where's the baby?!

6300
04:26:30,330 --> 04:26:30,890
Lord Liu Bei.

6301
04:26:31,470 --> 04:26:33,250
I have returned with your son.

6302
04:26:33,990 --> 04:26:34,750
He is safe...

6303
04:26:35,270 --> 04:26:35,890
And unharmed.

6304
04:26:36,890 --> 04:26:37,430
Xiao Yun!

6305
04:26:37,890 --> 04:26:39,490
Good to see you back in one piece.

6306
04:26:40,290 --> 04:26:41,910
You ran through hell, Ferato.

6307
04:26:42,350 --> 04:26:43,950
You have my eternal gratitude.

6308
04:26:45,530 --> 04:26:46,690
Alright, we did it.

6309
04:26:46,830 --> 04:26:47,710
Oh fuck, okay.

6310
04:26:48,910 --> 04:26:49,390
Um...

6311
04:26:50,370 --> 04:26:51,710
Okay, now...

6312
04:26:52,170 --> 04:26:54,030
Now it's special time, I guess.

6313
04:26:54,310 --> 04:26:54,730
I...

6314
04:26:57,790 --> 04:26:58,350
Um...

6315
04:26:59,030 --> 04:26:59,590
Okay.

6316
04:27:01,030 --> 04:27:04,530
I guess I'll have to figure out the secret passage now.

6317
04:27:07,230 --> 04:27:08,330
I have to go here?

6318
04:27:08,590 --> 04:27:09,450
No, I can't...

6319
04:27:09,450 --> 04:27:10,150
Wait, where do I go?

6320
04:27:13,070 --> 04:27:14,290
Wait, how do I...

6321
04:27:14,290 --> 04:27:14,830
Oh, I...

6322
04:27:14,830 --> 04:27:15,810
What do I do?

6323
04:27:20,010 --> 04:27:21,070
What do I do?

6324
04:27:23,190 --> 04:27:23,690
Hello?

6325
04:27:24,130 --> 04:27:24,610
Liu Bei.

6326
04:27:25,530 --> 04:27:26,470
We got the baby.

6327
04:27:28,790 --> 04:27:30,390
Oh, those are the peasants!

6328
04:27:31,350 --> 04:27:31,850
Wait...

6329
04:27:31,850 --> 04:27:32,750
Oh, we were waiting for them!

6330
04:27:33,910 --> 04:27:35,210
You waited for us!

6331
04:27:35,210 --> 04:27:36,150
We did it, guys!

6332
04:27:36,430 --> 04:27:37,390
It is good to see you safe.

6333
04:27:38,090 --> 04:27:39,450
It is difficult, I know.

6334
04:27:39,850 --> 04:27:41,470
But hang on a little while longer.

6335
04:27:43,850 --> 04:27:44,590
No, they...

6336
04:27:44,590 --> 04:27:45,730
No, he drops the baby.

6337
04:27:45,930 --> 04:27:46,390
You can't...

6338
04:27:46,390 --> 04:27:47,230
That's a cat event.

6339
04:27:49,290 --> 04:27:52,190
It seems not all were able to escape unscathed.

6340
04:27:53,970 --> 04:27:54,410
Still...

6341
04:27:55,170 --> 04:27:56,730
We must move on for now.

6342
04:27:58,310 --> 04:27:59,450
Okay, we gotta go.

6343
04:28:01,850 --> 04:28:02,330
Apparently...

6344
04:28:02,330 --> 04:28:05,590
I have to use my ego vision for this.

6345
04:28:05,850 --> 04:28:08,110
I don't know when it's gonna be helpful, though.

6346
04:28:10,310 --> 04:28:11,270
But apparently...

6347
04:28:12,290 --> 04:28:13,410
Oh, there it is!

6348
04:28:13,610 --> 04:28:14,330
Okay, nevermind!

6349
04:28:14,530 --> 04:28:14,890
There...

6350
04:28:17,010 --> 04:28:17,490
Nevermind!

6351
04:28:17,970 --> 04:28:18,990
There's people here!

6352
04:28:21,750 --> 04:28:22,890
Okay, where is he?

6353
04:28:23,030 --> 04:28:24,190
Where is the guy to kill?

6354
04:28:24,190 --> 04:28:26,550
He intends to continue down this path.

6355
04:28:26,970 --> 04:28:32,790
It is a road that can only be traveled while sacrificing people along the way.

6356
04:28:33,190 --> 04:28:34,570
Wait, you can guard?

6357
04:28:35,270 --> 04:28:36,710
We can just do that?

6358
04:28:38,730 --> 04:28:39,910
That's cheating!

6359
04:28:40,750 --> 04:28:42,550
You're not the main character!

6360
04:28:43,830 --> 04:28:45,570
Who lets you guard?

6361
04:28:48,510 --> 04:28:49,970
Okay, get out of here.

6362
04:28:49,970 --> 04:28:52,230
No one's allowed to defend him!

6363
04:28:52,810 --> 04:28:54,350
In my video games!

6364
04:28:57,510 --> 04:28:58,110
Oh.

6365
04:28:58,410 --> 04:28:58,910
Huh?

6366
04:29:08,190 --> 04:29:10,290
Oh my god, this is my Oshi!

6367
04:29:11,690 --> 04:29:13,430
Oh my god, my Oshi's here!

6368
04:29:13,430 --> 04:29:13,550
Yeah!

6369
04:29:16,110 --> 04:29:17,590
And, like, his plus one!

6370
04:29:18,190 --> 04:29:19,190
Whoever she...

6371
04:29:23,090 --> 04:29:24,190
She doesn't matter.

6372
04:29:30,030 --> 04:29:31,770
I'm glad he kept his fan.

6373
04:29:32,110 --> 04:29:34,150
That's, like, one of my favorite parts about his design.

6374
04:29:34,910 --> 04:29:35,430
Like...

6375
04:29:35,430 --> 04:29:39,690
Well, his mustache and his fans are, like, one of my favorite parts of his design.

6376
04:29:39,690 --> 04:29:41,710
It just sucks that they...

6377
04:29:42,970 --> 04:29:43,530
Um...

6378
04:29:43,530 --> 04:29:45,470
I'm just sad that they removed this mustache.

6379
04:29:46,090 --> 04:29:47,610
It just feels so empty.

6380
04:29:47,890 --> 04:29:49,430
But at least they kept the fan.

6381
04:29:49,630 --> 04:29:50,750
Because it's so iconic.

6382
04:30:04,910 --> 04:30:05,930
Oh, that's good.

6383
04:30:10,620 --> 04:30:11,100
Slash!

6384
04:30:11,800 --> 04:30:12,240
Slash!

6385
04:30:13,900 --> 04:30:14,860
Oh my god, that's so strong.

6386
04:30:15,660 --> 04:30:15,900
Oh my god, that's so strong.

6387
04:30:16,580 --> 04:30:19,160
We can start putting our plans into place.

6388
04:30:20,260 --> 04:30:22,560
New Bay must not be allowed to escape.

6389
04:30:23,340 --> 04:30:26,520
All forces are to pursue him with every man available.

6390
04:30:27,060 --> 04:30:28,200
Break all the shields!

6391
04:30:28,420 --> 04:30:29,040
Do it!

6392
04:30:30,760 --> 04:30:32,660
Oh my god, there's so many other...

6393
04:30:32,660 --> 04:30:35,380
Oh my god, there's so many reinforcements.

6394
04:30:35,380 --> 04:30:36,680
What the fuck?

6395
04:30:36,880 --> 04:30:37,500
What the fuck?

6396
04:30:41,060 --> 04:30:43,260
Maybe the guy was running.

6397
04:30:43,500 --> 04:30:44,560
Maybe I...

6398
04:30:45,900 --> 04:30:46,480
Hmm...

6399
04:30:47,060 --> 04:30:48,100
Maybe...

6400
04:30:49,320 --> 04:30:50,480
Following me...

6401
04:30:51,400 --> 04:30:53,800
Provides too much killing.

6402
04:31:03,530 --> 04:31:04,090
Hmm...

6403
04:31:04,090 --> 04:31:04,530
Alright.

6404
04:31:04,530 --> 04:31:06,890
Alright, if Tao Tao gets too close, then I'll...

6405
04:31:06,890 --> 04:31:07,930
I'll kill Tao Tao.

6406
04:31:11,970 --> 04:31:12,530
No.

6407
04:31:13,270 --> 04:31:14,670
Wait, I can actually kill him.

6408
04:31:17,910 --> 04:31:19,910
Oh, guys, I ran out of buns.

6409
04:31:20,530 --> 04:31:21,590
Wait, this is bad.

6410
04:31:22,030 --> 04:31:23,570
I actually ran out of buns, guys.

6411
04:31:24,610 --> 04:31:24,910
I...

6412
04:31:24,910 --> 04:31:26,070
Oh, no!

6413
04:31:26,410 --> 04:31:26,530
No!

6414
04:31:31,810 --> 04:31:32,930
I am...

6415
04:31:32,930 --> 04:31:33,930
A little worried...

6416
04:31:33,930 --> 04:31:35,650
Because I am bun-less.

6417
04:31:36,570 --> 04:31:37,690
So, like...

6418
04:31:38,310 --> 04:31:42,130
I have one fear right now, in that I have zero buns.

6419
04:31:46,120 --> 04:31:47,020
Oh, nice.

6420
04:31:47,240 --> 04:31:48,520
Oh, they blocked the exit.

6421
04:31:49,720 --> 04:31:50,280
Nice.

6422
04:31:52,680 --> 04:31:54,280
Okay, maybe escape is easier.

6423
04:31:55,440 --> 04:31:57,680
Let's wipe them out, while they're confused.

6424
04:31:59,540 --> 04:32:01,280
Okay, I have to save my...

6425
04:32:03,240 --> 04:32:03,680
My...

6426
04:32:05,420 --> 04:32:05,860
My...

6427
04:32:05,860 --> 04:32:06,020
My...

6428
04:32:06,020 --> 04:32:08,220
I don't know what it's called, but my strong attack.

6429
04:32:13,730 --> 04:32:14,530
Get out of here.

6430
04:32:17,610 --> 04:32:18,430
Get out of here.

6431
04:32:18,430 --> 04:32:22,770
Get out of here.

6432
04:32:22,770 --> 04:32:27,190
There is something you should know about the mountain pass that Tao Tao's forces are taking.

6433
04:32:28,070 --> 04:32:30,630
There is actually a second route near the pass.

6434
04:32:31,050 --> 04:32:32,030
There's a second route?

6435
04:32:33,290 --> 04:32:34,150
Wait, what is me?

6436
04:32:34,250 --> 04:32:34,770
Oh, no.

6437
04:32:34,990 --> 04:32:35,550
Oh, my God.

6438
04:32:35,610 --> 04:32:36,230
I'm almost dead.

6439
04:32:36,450 --> 04:32:36,850
Oh!

6440
04:32:37,130 --> 04:32:38,090
I can't...

6441
04:32:38,090 --> 04:32:39,330
I had to use it.

6442
04:32:40,250 --> 04:32:40,610
I had...

6443
04:32:40,610 --> 04:32:41,430
Guys, I'm...

6444
04:32:41,430 --> 04:32:42,930
This gives my HP back, though.

6445
04:32:44,010 --> 04:32:45,710
This might be a little...

6446
04:32:46,430 --> 04:32:46,910
This...

6447
04:32:48,610 --> 04:32:49,590
But, like...

6448
04:32:49,590 --> 04:32:51,050
I would have actually died.

6449
04:32:51,150 --> 04:32:52,170
I would have died.

6450
04:32:52,170 --> 04:32:52,490
That...

6451
04:32:53,750 --> 04:32:54,890
Okay, there you go.

6452
04:32:55,110 --> 04:32:56,190
I have my HP back.

6453
04:32:59,050 --> 04:32:59,850
It's okay.

6454
04:33:00,070 --> 04:33:00,770
It's okay, guys.

6455
04:33:00,890 --> 04:33:01,950
I have my HP back.

6456
04:33:06,210 --> 04:33:06,770
Yay!

6457
04:33:08,690 --> 04:33:09,710
Oh, no!

6458
04:33:10,650 --> 04:33:11,810
The wife died?

6459
04:33:12,170 --> 04:33:12,970
Oh, no!

6460
04:33:13,110 --> 04:33:14,370
I'm so sorry!

6461
04:33:15,250 --> 04:33:18,930
If only I could have done something to stop it!

6462
04:33:18,930 --> 04:33:20,670
Now, we'll make you realize...

6463
04:33:20,670 --> 04:33:21,230
Oh!

6464
04:33:21,590 --> 04:33:22,330
My God!

6465
04:33:22,770 --> 04:33:23,610
I'm so sorry!

6466
04:33:25,270 --> 04:33:26,650
I'm so sorry!

6467
04:33:27,270 --> 04:33:29,010
I will not allow you to block our path.

6468
04:33:29,730 --> 04:33:31,730
We will break through!

6469
04:33:32,510 --> 04:33:33,750
Are you...

6470
04:33:33,750 --> 04:33:35,350
Ready to face me?

6471
04:33:35,890 --> 04:33:37,090
What a shame!

6472
04:33:37,850 --> 04:33:38,850
I did not expect...

6473
04:33:38,850 --> 04:33:40,530
I have no choice...

6474
04:33:40,530 --> 04:33:41,610
...but to retreat.

6475
04:33:43,330 --> 04:33:45,330
Okay, that's good that you guys are still alive.

6476
04:33:45,330 --> 04:33:46,930
That's actually really good.

6477
04:33:47,190 --> 04:33:48,790
Ha ha ha ha ha!

6478
04:33:51,570 --> 04:33:52,230
Oh, man!

6479
04:33:53,510 --> 04:33:56,970
If only I could do something about it!

6480
04:34:03,540 --> 04:34:04,460
Wait, what?

6481
04:34:04,920 --> 04:34:06,180
Oh my God, finally!

6482
04:34:07,100 --> 04:34:08,360
We've come with forces...

6483
04:34:08,840 --> 04:34:09,840
...bought from Jiang Sha!

6484
04:34:12,080 --> 04:34:12,640
So...

6485
04:34:12,640 --> 04:34:14,980
You're single now, right?

6486
04:34:15,360 --> 04:34:17,600
Now that, you know, your wife...

6487
04:34:18,040 --> 04:34:18,320
...died?

6488
04:34:21,040 --> 04:34:22,160
Now that...

6489
04:34:22,160 --> 04:34:24,440
...your wife, you know...

6490
04:34:24,440 --> 04:34:24,560
...failed?

6491
04:34:26,040 --> 04:34:27,260
It's such a shame!

6492
04:34:27,840 --> 04:34:30,960
Don't worry, I'll be the shoulder to cry on!

6493
04:34:31,260 --> 04:34:33,920
Also, I need to know when my food is here.

6494
04:34:34,100 --> 04:34:35,100
Give me a sec, guys.

6495
04:34:36,180 --> 04:34:37,380
Oh, okay, it's gonna be late.

6496
04:34:37,500 --> 04:34:37,920
Never mind.

6497
04:34:38,260 --> 04:34:39,100
It's gonna take more...

6498
04:34:39,100 --> 04:34:39,880
...another 20 minutes.

6499
04:34:40,040 --> 04:34:40,260
Okay.

6500
04:34:40,680 --> 04:34:41,800
I got a little worried.

6501
04:34:42,080 --> 04:34:44,020
I'm craving my lasagna right now.

6502
04:34:45,700 --> 04:34:46,220
I...

6503
04:34:47,060 --> 04:34:48,000
Don't worry.

6504
04:34:48,480 --> 04:34:52,340
I will be the shoulder you can cry on!

6505
04:34:53,680 --> 04:34:55,400
She just died!

6506
04:34:58,380 --> 04:35:01,000
I mean, he needs to process his grief!

6507
04:35:01,180 --> 04:35:02,740
He can't process his grief alone!

6508
04:35:02,740 --> 04:35:05,020
Everything has gone according to plan.

6509
04:35:05,160 --> 04:35:05,460
Guys!

6510
04:35:06,500 --> 04:35:08,780
I can't let him process his grief alone!

6511
04:35:09,420 --> 04:35:11,500
That would be too cruel!

6512
04:35:18,900 --> 04:35:19,840
Very nice.

6513
04:35:24,840 --> 04:35:26,260
Very nice, we gotta kill him.

6514
04:35:28,300 --> 04:35:28,860
Wait!

6515
04:35:28,860 --> 04:35:29,980
We gotta save him!

6516
04:35:30,620 --> 04:35:31,220
Oh my god!

6517
04:35:32,420 --> 04:35:32,980
Wait!

6518
04:35:34,060 --> 04:35:34,620
Wait!

6519
04:35:35,180 --> 04:35:35,920
Get out!

6520
04:35:36,200 --> 04:35:36,520
Get out!

6521
04:35:36,660 --> 04:35:37,220
Get out!

6522
04:35:37,360 --> 04:35:37,420
Get out!

6523
04:35:38,380 --> 04:35:41,980
Oh my god!

6524
04:35:42,080 --> 04:35:42,960
I did it!

6525
04:35:43,300 --> 04:35:43,340
No!

6526
04:35:45,740 --> 04:35:47,280
I did it!

6527
04:35:47,640 --> 04:35:47,660
No!

6528
04:35:48,480 --> 04:35:49,440
No!

6529
04:35:55,620 --> 04:35:56,580
No!

6530
04:36:02,560 --> 04:36:03,520
No!

6531
04:36:06,700 --> 04:36:11,640
What's even worth fighting for?

6532
04:36:11,980 --> 04:36:14,860
Just for some peasants?!

6533
04:36:14,860 --> 04:36:20,500
Life is meaningless now without my Oshi.

6534
04:36:21,000 --> 04:36:24,800
What do I do now?!

6535
04:36:24,800 --> 04:36:30,900
I'm so sad.

6536
04:36:36,300 --> 04:36:37,100
Restart.

6537
04:36:38,060 --> 04:36:41,120
Wait, there's like a bunch of bread just lying there.

6538
04:36:43,020 --> 04:36:44,260
Too real.

6539
04:36:44,760 --> 04:36:46,220
Too real.

6540
04:36:51,760 --> 04:36:53,260
It's so sad.

6541
04:36:55,680 --> 04:36:59,200
I can't believe he would do this to me.

6542
04:36:59,360 --> 04:37:00,960
What about me?!

6543
04:37:03,660 --> 04:37:06,880
How could he do this to us?!

6544
04:37:06,880 --> 04:37:16,060
All right, nice.

6545
04:37:22,750 --> 04:37:23,730
Oh no.

6546
04:37:26,810 --> 04:37:27,950
Jesus Christ.

6547
04:37:30,430 --> 04:37:33,270
Oh my god, he's so tanky!

6548
04:37:33,270 --> 04:37:34,950
This retreat would be the best option right now.

6549
04:37:37,470 --> 04:37:40,350
I'm trying my best to kill him!

6550
04:37:41,150 --> 04:37:41,730
Now.

6551
04:37:43,290 --> 04:37:45,250
Please, let me kill you!

6552
04:37:45,650 --> 04:37:46,110
Time to act.

6553
04:37:47,870 --> 04:37:49,850
Oh my god!

6554
04:37:52,750 --> 04:37:54,070
Oh my god!

6555
04:37:54,630 --> 04:37:55,610
He got me in the corner!

6556
04:37:59,710 --> 04:38:01,090
Jesus Christ.

6557
04:38:01,090 --> 04:38:04,650
He got me in the corner!

6558
04:38:05,290 --> 04:38:06,170
He got me in the corner!

6559
04:38:06,250 --> 04:38:07,170
I'm trying to kill you!

6560
04:38:07,170 --> 04:38:07,270
Alright!

6561
04:38:08,110 --> 04:38:09,770
Am I still gonna- Oh my god!

6562
04:38:09,930 --> 04:38:11,370
I have to fight him regardless!

6563
04:38:12,030 --> 04:38:13,170
I can't believe it!

6564
04:38:13,630 --> 04:38:14,870
It doesn't matter!

6565
04:38:15,010 --> 04:38:16,170
I have to fight him regardless!

6566
04:38:16,170 --> 04:38:16,490
Deadless.

6567
04:38:23,760 --> 04:38:25,380
What the fuck, where?

6568
04:38:26,280 --> 04:38:32,260
Oh my god, there's so many things happening!

6569
04:38:37,960 --> 04:38:40,220
Like, there's too many bosses!

6570
04:38:40,220 --> 04:38:40,520
What is this?

6571
04:38:46,900 --> 04:38:47,880
Eleven, thank you!

6572
04:38:48,020 --> 04:38:48,980
Welcome to Tomato Farm!

6573
04:38:49,180 --> 04:38:49,820
Welcome, welcome!

6574
04:38:50,340 --> 04:38:51,980
You're right for Baoshi.

6575
04:38:52,920 --> 04:38:53,940
Do it for him!

6576
04:38:58,320 --> 04:38:59,600
Oh my god, okay.

6577
04:39:00,840 --> 04:39:02,420
Alright, you guys are gonna die for this, I'm sorry.

6578
04:39:04,260 --> 04:39:05,300
He's coming for you!

6579
04:39:05,580 --> 04:39:06,360
I'm sorry!

6580
04:39:07,160 --> 04:39:09,540
Oh wait, oh wait, oh never mind, JK.

6581
04:39:09,780 --> 04:39:11,140
I was, it was a joke.

6582
04:39:12,500 --> 04:39:13,020
Sorry.

6583
04:39:13,020 --> 04:39:14,400
That was just a joke, guys.

6584
04:39:14,580 --> 04:39:15,880
What do you mean, die?

6585
04:39:16,260 --> 04:39:16,720
JK.

6586
04:39:17,280 --> 04:39:19,200
It was just a funny, haha joke.

6587
04:39:21,260 --> 04:39:21,780
Oh.

6588
04:39:21,780 --> 04:39:22,460
Oh, no.

6589
04:39:25,040 --> 04:39:26,080
Oh, no.

6590
04:39:26,080 --> 04:39:26,520
No.

6591
04:39:31,860 --> 04:39:33,580
I'm sorry, dragoons.

6592
04:39:34,020 --> 04:39:36,320
I'm, I'm so sorry.

6593
04:39:38,080 --> 04:39:39,600
He doesn't know I'm here.

6594
04:39:47,400 --> 04:39:52,920
Guys, he knew I was, I, I thought I, I thought I could live.

6595
04:39:52,920 --> 04:40:03,060
I, I didn't, I didn't realize he would just kill all of us.

6596
04:40:03,300 --> 04:40:04,560
Holy shit.

6597
04:40:05,380 --> 04:40:07,180
He was so strong.

6598
04:40:07,660 --> 04:40:08,040
Um.

6599
04:40:10,260 --> 04:40:11,160
That was my bad.

6600
04:40:12,420 --> 04:40:13,860
Maybe, um.

6601
04:40:14,980 --> 04:40:18,600
I would say that that might have been my bad.

6602
04:40:20,700 --> 04:40:24,420
I thought, I thought we had longer to live.

6603
04:40:24,840 --> 04:40:25,700
Not gonna lie.

6604
04:40:30,980 --> 04:40:33,960
Alright, let's try and kill this guy.

6605
04:40:34,940 --> 04:40:37,840
Which is, I'm not very hopeful, Ren.

6606
04:40:38,180 --> 04:40:38,440
Okay.

6607
04:40:39,200 --> 04:40:40,120
Oh my god.

6608
04:40:41,240 --> 04:40:44,000
I am, I am scared.

6609
04:40:44,740 --> 04:40:45,240
Okay.

6610
04:40:45,580 --> 04:40:46,240
There you go.

6611
04:40:46,600 --> 04:40:49,540
I saved it for just this special occasion.

6612
04:40:51,240 --> 04:40:51,920
There you go.

6613
04:40:53,900 --> 04:40:54,460
There you go.

6614
04:40:54,680 --> 04:40:55,640
I got this.

6615
04:40:56,460 --> 04:40:57,180
Okay.

6616
04:41:04,450 --> 04:41:05,230
That's fine.

6617
04:41:05,710 --> 04:41:07,730
Now it's my power.

6618
04:41:09,430 --> 04:41:11,050
Bear witness to my power.

6619
04:41:12,330 --> 04:41:13,270
That's right.

6620
04:41:14,950 --> 04:41:16,970
Behold my power.

6621
04:41:18,890 --> 04:41:20,070
Let's end this.

6622
04:41:21,490 --> 04:41:22,870
It's rage time.

6623
04:41:23,450 --> 04:41:24,990
I kept it for this reason.

6624
04:41:25,670 --> 04:41:27,450
However, we shall meet in battle again.

6625
04:41:27,570 --> 04:41:27,950
Alright guys.

6626
04:41:28,470 --> 04:41:31,290
I think I can, I think I can take Tau Tau.

6627
04:41:31,490 --> 04:41:32,490
I'm going back.

6628
04:41:32,490 --> 04:41:33,410
Hahaha.

6629
04:41:36,210 --> 04:41:37,030
Guys.

6630
04:41:37,710 --> 04:41:39,490
I'm ready to change history.

6631
04:41:40,140 --> 04:41:41,210
I'm going back.

6632
04:41:42,130 --> 04:41:43,650
I'm going back.

6633
04:41:45,170 --> 04:41:47,680
What is this fog?

6634
04:41:49,010 --> 04:41:49,630
Wait, what?

6635
04:41:50,790 --> 04:41:52,630
Wait, am I supposed to fight it?

6636
04:41:52,630 --> 04:41:52,710
What is this?

6637
04:41:54,450 --> 04:41:55,090
Hello?

6638
04:41:55,750 --> 04:41:58,010
I cannot let Liu Bei go after all.

6639
04:41:58,790 --> 04:42:00,190
Allowing him to pass.

6640
04:42:00,810 --> 04:42:02,910
Would be too great a risk.

6641
04:42:03,750 --> 04:42:04,250
Wait, what?

6642
04:42:07,590 --> 04:42:08,650
What happened?

6643
04:42:08,990 --> 04:42:11,090
So you've come, Zuluwan.

6644
04:42:12,070 --> 04:42:15,890
You mean to protect Liu Bei to the very end, it would seem.

6645
04:42:18,670 --> 04:42:20,890
Wait, what's a different ending?

6646
04:42:20,890 --> 04:42:21,870
You better ready yourself.

6647
04:42:22,050 --> 04:42:24,010
You'd best be prepared to fight.

6648
04:42:25,550 --> 04:42:26,950
Wait, what do you guys mean?

6649
04:42:27,750 --> 04:42:29,090
As guardians of peace!

6650
04:42:30,570 --> 04:42:31,890
Guys, what do you mean?

6651
04:42:31,990 --> 04:42:34,050
Wait, I could have done a different ending?

6652
04:42:34,590 --> 04:42:36,050
Helpless citizens into battle.

6653
04:42:36,650 --> 04:42:40,350
What can you call this but the worst kind of violence?

6654
04:42:41,270 --> 04:42:44,130
Despite this, you would protect him?

6655
04:42:44,470 --> 04:42:48,870
Does your bond with him truly serve as reason enough?

6656
04:42:48,870 --> 04:42:50,070
Time to act.

6657
04:42:51,030 --> 04:42:52,050
Oh my god.

6658
04:42:54,410 --> 04:42:55,030
What?

6659
04:42:56,510 --> 04:42:59,670
What am I- What is this?

6660
04:43:00,030 --> 04:43:02,010
How is that different from the guardians of peace?

6661
04:43:02,010 --> 04:43:03,350
We hate it so much.

6662
04:43:03,950 --> 04:43:08,470
How is Liu Bei any different from the ones who took everything from us?

6663
04:43:08,470 --> 04:43:10,590
How does you believe that?

6664
04:43:10,610 --> 04:43:11,430
How v했습니다?

6665
04:43:11,430 --> 04:43:15,990
צרbereich Firstницу And despair has been burned into my mind.

6666
04:43:15,990 --> 04:43:21,250
The suffering, the agony, the chaos, what has revealed to me?

6667
04:43:21,450 --> 04:43:21,990
Juzis!

6668
04:43:21,990 --> 04:43:22,970
My new pass.

6669
04:43:24,730 --> 04:43:26,450
Reject all heroes.

6670
04:43:27,170 --> 04:43:28,570
I rejected the Hanandu.

6671
04:43:28,570 --> 04:43:29,890
Oh my, okay, Shadow.

6672
04:43:32,530 --> 04:43:35,610
He truly is the shadow of this game.

6673
04:43:43,830 --> 04:43:46,490
No, this is actually Shadow right now.

6674
04:43:53,620 --> 04:43:56,200
So what's the different ending if I trigger it?

6675
04:44:00,520 --> 04:44:02,380
He's such an- Yeah!

6676
04:44:02,820 --> 04:44:04,880
It's literally just Shadow!

6677
04:44:07,960 --> 04:44:09,600
Why don't you remember?

6678
04:44:11,060 --> 04:44:12,900
How can you?

6679
04:44:20,410 --> 04:44:23,110
Do you mean to kill me, Tsuluan?

6680
04:44:25,150 --> 04:44:27,430
It would be a fitting end.

6681
04:44:28,170 --> 04:44:36,510
But as long as these heroes exist in the world, there will always be someone like me who opposes them.

6682
04:44:37,010 --> 04:44:40,450
Why not join us?

6683
04:44:40,710 --> 04:44:43,050
Let's return home together, Bailon.

6684
04:44:44,310 --> 04:44:44,910
Impossible.

6685
04:44:45,790 --> 04:44:47,330
Our village was destroyed.

6686
04:44:47,990 --> 04:44:49,590
And Juha is dead.

6687
04:44:50,650 --> 04:44:52,910
Neither of us will be returning anywhere.

6688
04:44:55,170 --> 04:44:59,950
However, I do not yet have the strength to defeat Liu Bei.

6689
04:45:00,670 --> 04:45:03,310
Okay, you hated me for following Sasa.

6690
04:45:03,410 --> 04:45:04,610
Now you hate me for Liu Bei.

6691
04:45:04,770 --> 04:45:05,910
Like, pick a lane.

6692
04:45:06,790 --> 04:45:08,250
You're giving me mixed signals.

6693
04:45:08,250 --> 04:45:11,450
The words Juha uttered before her death.

6694
04:45:12,250 --> 04:45:15,030
Do they still echo in your soul?

6695
04:45:16,370 --> 04:45:16,750
Live.

6696
04:45:17,170 --> 04:45:20,270
And create the world we dreamed of.

6697
04:45:20,990 --> 04:45:27,390
If you really think Liu Bei is a true hero- That we can trust- To bring our dreams to fruition.

6698
04:45:28,010 --> 04:45:31,690
Then do what you must- To make me believe it.

6699
04:45:32,210 --> 04:45:37,770
But the moment he strays from that path- And is deemed unworthy of our trust.

6700
04:45:39,510 --> 04:45:42,410
The guardians of peace will bring him to ruin.

6701
04:45:42,530 --> 04:45:44,110
Wait, that's not very peaceful of you.

6702
04:45:44,270 --> 04:45:44,870
No matter how long it takes.

6703
04:45:46,030 --> 04:45:47,870
That's not very peaceful of us.

6704
04:45:50,810 --> 04:45:51,970
Farewell, Zuluon.

6705
04:45:53,210 --> 04:45:55,530
May we one day fly together.

6706
04:46:01,160 --> 04:46:02,300
Wait a minute.

6707
04:46:02,820 --> 04:46:04,580
That's not peaceful at all.

6708
04:46:04,580 --> 04:46:05,640
The two of them who are united must unite.

6709
04:46:06,120 --> 04:46:09,840
While those who have been long united must diverge.

6710
04:46:10,940 --> 04:46:16,160
Thus has it always been, For empires and their people alike.

6711
04:46:17,000 --> 04:46:18,580
Guardian of Peace.

6712
04:46:19,540 --> 04:46:22,300
The time has come to part ways.

6713
04:46:23,340 --> 04:46:28,560
One will champion heroes, Striving to bring peace to the world.

6714
04:46:28,560 --> 04:46:34,720
The other will lurk in the shadows, keeping the heroes true to their path.

6715
04:46:36,060 --> 04:46:40,880
That is the new way of the Guardians of Peace.

6716
04:46:41,980 --> 04:46:44,580
And thus shall our purpose be fulfilled.

6717
04:46:44,840 --> 04:46:46,860
We need light and dark to do this.

6718
04:46:47,160 --> 04:46:48,820
This is the last time I appear before you.

6719
04:46:51,880 --> 04:46:53,320
Who are you, really?

6720
04:46:53,500 --> 04:46:55,020
Yeah, you're clearly not by long.

6721
04:46:56,520 --> 04:46:57,360
Well...

6722
04:46:57,780 --> 04:47:02,020
It is said that the founders of our order were mystical beings.

6723
04:47:02,020 --> 04:47:08,420
That they had the faces of children, with hair as white as snow.

6724
04:47:08,740 --> 04:47:13,400
And eyes as blue as the surface of a frozen lake.

6725
04:47:14,040 --> 04:47:18,900
And that no number of years could ever age them.

6726
04:47:20,660 --> 04:47:23,940
Zuluon, you must go now.

6727
04:47:23,940 --> 04:47:28,300
Let your eyes guard you on your true path.

6728
04:47:28,480 --> 04:47:30,400
I guess he's like a god or something.

6729
04:47:30,880 --> 04:47:32,500
And kill all that has been entrusted to you.

6730
04:47:36,530 --> 04:47:37,970
He's like a...

6731
04:47:38,930 --> 04:47:39,970
Like a...

6732
04:47:39,970 --> 04:47:40,810
Maybe like a de...

6733
04:47:40,810 --> 04:47:42,590
Like not a demon, but like a...

6734
04:47:44,690 --> 04:47:45,990
Like one of the gods.

6735
04:47:45,990 --> 04:47:47,670
It seems that everyone is safe.

6736
04:47:48,230 --> 04:47:49,450
And he just took...

6737
04:47:49,450 --> 04:47:51,390
He just took the appearance of...

6738
04:47:51,390 --> 04:47:52,350
Uh, Bai Long.

6739
04:47:52,550 --> 04:47:54,170
Cause that was Bai Long when he was young.

6740
04:47:54,550 --> 04:47:56,050
So like, they took his appearance.

6741
04:47:57,550 --> 04:47:58,550
Maybe a Buddha?

6742
04:47:58,990 --> 04:47:59,530
Could be.

6743
04:48:00,010 --> 04:48:01,790
We shall head downstream towards Jungsha.

6744
04:48:02,110 --> 04:48:02,710
Could be a...

6745
04:48:02,710 --> 04:48:04,670
Well, it could be any of the gods.

6746
04:48:04,950 --> 04:48:05,250
We need to start again.

6747
04:48:05,970 --> 04:48:06,430
Together.

6748
04:48:07,450 --> 04:48:10,250
A lot of them are pretty mischievous people.

6749
04:48:10,250 --> 04:48:10,410
There.

6750
04:48:10,790 --> 04:48:12,850
We still have a major problem.

6751
04:48:12,850 --> 04:48:14,610
Even if we have control of Jing.

6752
04:48:20,350 --> 04:48:21,530
I'm checking my...

6753
04:48:22,370 --> 04:48:22,790
Lasagna.

6754
04:48:24,490 --> 04:48:24,790
Though.

6755
04:48:25,190 --> 04:48:26,590
Given what we've lost.

6756
04:48:26,870 --> 04:48:28,550
It's hard to feel much joy.

6757
04:48:29,530 --> 04:48:29,690
Brother.

6758
04:48:30,070 --> 04:48:30,610
What?

6759
04:48:31,450 --> 04:48:32,830
Lord Liubei.

6760
04:48:32,910 --> 04:48:34,490
They cancelled my order?

6761
04:48:35,430 --> 04:48:36,150
Please do not be yourself.

6762
04:48:36,150 --> 04:48:39,030
For we've never had the luxury of time...

6763
04:48:39,030 --> 04:48:39,350
To lament.

6764
04:48:40,470 --> 04:48:42,090
It is true...

6765
04:48:42,090 --> 04:48:43,390
That we've lost much.

6766
04:48:44,450 --> 04:48:45,110
But...

6767
04:48:45,110 --> 04:48:45,930
Because of it...

6768
04:48:45,930 --> 04:48:47,570
Wait, why was my order cancelled?

6769
04:48:47,570 --> 04:48:49,570
You have been something much greater, my lord.

6770
04:48:53,890 --> 04:48:55,050
Wait a minute.

6771
04:48:55,270 --> 04:48:55,530
Guys.

6772
04:48:55,750 --> 04:48:56,510
I'm mad.

6773
04:49:00,150 --> 04:49:01,590
I'm reordering.

6774
04:49:01,590 --> 04:49:04,090
I need to know why this was cancelled.

6775
04:49:05,390 --> 04:49:07,590
I waited so long!

6776
04:49:08,930 --> 04:49:11,390
How was my order cancelled?

6777
04:49:18,150 --> 04:49:19,590
Guys, give me a sec.

6778
04:49:19,750 --> 04:49:22,690
I'm trying to figure out how my order was cancelled.

6779
04:49:24,430 --> 04:49:25,110
Wait.

6780
04:49:25,310 --> 04:49:26,170
Why would I...

6781
04:49:26,170 --> 04:49:28,210
I have to pay again?

6782
04:49:28,510 --> 04:49:29,550
Would it...

6783
04:49:30,650 --> 04:49:31,330
Wait.

6784
04:49:32,510 --> 04:49:33,830
View receipts.

6785
04:49:40,670 --> 04:49:41,390
Okay.

6786
04:49:41,630 --> 04:49:42,430
Um...

6787
04:49:42,430 --> 04:49:44,350
It doesn't say why it was cancelled.

6788
04:49:44,610 --> 04:49:45,790
It just said cancelled.

6789
04:49:47,630 --> 04:49:48,470
What?

6790
04:49:50,570 --> 04:49:52,450
I'm reordering the same thing.

6791
04:49:53,330 --> 04:49:55,090
I'm reordering this.

6792
04:49:55,670 --> 04:49:56,510
I'm...

6793
04:49:56,510 --> 04:49:57,990
I'm so hungry.

6794
04:49:57,990 --> 04:49:59,150
I don't understand.

6795
04:50:06,700 --> 04:50:08,600
They didn't even text me!

6796
04:50:14,470 --> 04:50:14,910
Why?

6797
04:50:14,910 --> 04:50:17,050
They didn't even text me why it was cancelled!

6798
04:50:17,790 --> 04:50:18,810
They just cancelled!

6799
04:50:21,950 --> 04:50:23,570
No, they would like be like...

6800
04:50:23,570 --> 04:50:24,790
Oh, we don't have your order.

6801
04:50:25,010 --> 04:50:25,690
Could you like...

6802
04:50:25,690 --> 04:50:26,870
But he like, waited!

6803
04:50:30,490 --> 04:50:31,770
Oh yeah, I have a...

6804
04:50:31,770 --> 04:50:32,430
Dad update.

6805
04:50:32,610 --> 04:50:32,850
Nice.

6806
04:50:40,330 --> 04:50:40,930
He's good.

6807
04:50:41,090 --> 04:50:43,630
He's getting more and more rambutious as he feels better.

6808
04:50:43,850 --> 04:50:46,530
He wants to run around and seems more back to normal now.

6809
04:50:46,870 --> 04:50:49,350
His back legs are still weak, but he can walk fine.

6810
04:50:50,230 --> 04:50:50,670
Um...

6811
04:50:50,670 --> 04:50:51,990
Just not very fast running.

6812
04:50:52,150 --> 04:50:55,710
You can tell he wants to start running, but his back legs can't go that fast.

6813
04:50:56,490 --> 04:50:56,930
Aw...

6814
04:50:56,930 --> 04:50:58,270
Aw, that's cute.

6815
04:50:58,870 --> 04:50:59,510
That's cute.

6816
04:50:59,610 --> 04:51:02,150
Also, why the fuck did they cancel my order?!

6817
04:51:04,190 --> 04:51:08,630
There was a delivery guy in everything that was assigned to me!

6818
04:51:09,390 --> 04:51:10,070
I...

6819
04:51:11,670 --> 04:51:13,070
Order it one more time.

6820
04:51:13,070 --> 04:51:13,770
I'm so sad.

6821
04:51:13,770 --> 04:51:15,570
I was looking forward to this lasagna.

6822
04:51:16,150 --> 04:51:16,550
I...

6823
04:51:16,990 --> 04:51:18,270
I'm so sad.

6824
04:51:18,450 --> 04:51:20,070
I literally waited...

6825
04:51:20,070 --> 04:51:27,150
I watched them prepare the food, and then they assigned a delivery man to like...

6826
04:51:30,010 --> 04:51:30,490
There's...

6827
04:51:30,490 --> 04:51:32,430
Yeah, but then it was like, order was cancelled.

6828
04:51:39,540 --> 04:51:40,500
It just...

6829
04:51:40,500 --> 04:51:44,720
Yeah, but then it says, order was cancelled later on, so I got so...

6830
04:51:45,340 --> 04:51:45,820
I...

6831
04:51:45,820 --> 04:51:47,260
I was like...

6832
04:51:48,260 --> 04:51:49,520
I'm looking at it.

6833
04:51:49,660 --> 04:51:49,960
Help.

6834
04:51:52,100 --> 04:51:52,580
Uh...

6835
04:51:53,300 --> 04:51:55,860
Wait, did they charge me for the cancelled order?

6836
04:51:58,780 --> 04:51:59,660
Your receipt.

6837
04:51:59,660 --> 04:52:01,120
Your order has been cancelled.

6838
04:52:04,880 --> 04:52:05,680
It just...

6839
04:52:05,680 --> 04:52:08,440
They gave me a refund, but I think they refunded it to my card.

6840
04:52:09,120 --> 04:52:09,520
Yeah.

6841
04:52:09,740 --> 04:52:11,160
They refunded it to my card.

6842
04:52:11,320 --> 04:52:12,320
But it doesn't tell me like...

6843
04:52:14,160 --> 04:52:15,720
They closed and like...

6844
04:52:15,720 --> 04:52:15,840
What?

6845
04:52:15,920 --> 04:52:16,840
They don't close yet.

6846
04:52:16,940 --> 04:52:17,360
That's the thing.

6847
04:52:17,420 --> 04:52:18,660
I could reorder it.

6848
04:52:18,820 --> 04:52:21,060
But like, I don't know why it got cancelled.

6849
04:52:24,660 --> 04:52:25,620
It's so weird.

6850
04:52:26,040 --> 04:52:26,700
Cause like...

6851
04:52:26,700 --> 04:52:30,540
A delivery guy was assigned to my order, and then he was going to...

6852
04:52:30,540 --> 04:52:33,080
I saw him go drive to pick it up.

6853
04:52:36,600 --> 04:52:37,360
Yeah.

6854
04:52:37,920 --> 04:52:38,080
Alright.

6855
04:52:38,840 --> 04:52:39,180
Sad.

6856
04:52:39,380 --> 04:52:40,660
Today is...

6857
04:52:40,660 --> 04:52:43,160
All I wanted was my lasagna.

6858
04:52:43,800 --> 04:52:46,420
I just want my cheese.

6859
04:52:49,320 --> 04:52:51,460
I was looking forward to...

6860
04:52:51,980 --> 04:52:53,480
Bro, I'm starving.

6861
04:52:54,240 --> 04:52:55,380
I wasn't paying attention.

6862
04:52:55,380 --> 04:52:57,060
I was sad about my lasagna.

6863
04:52:57,060 --> 04:52:57,660
I'm sorry.

6864
04:52:57,660 --> 04:53:00,240
Tempting to put the Longzong plan into action.

6865
04:53:00,880 --> 04:53:06,900
If it succeeds, your strength will grow to rival that of Cao Cao and Suinchuan.

6866
04:53:08,260 --> 04:53:12,080
Cao Cao will most likely continue his southward advance.

6867
04:53:13,440 --> 04:53:18,320
In order to stop him, we must ally with Wu, who also opposes him.

6868
04:53:25,920 --> 04:53:27,700
I mean, there's two against one.

6869
04:53:27,900 --> 04:53:33,560
Judging from what I hear of Wu, they would be likely to prioritize peace within their borders and among their own people.

6870
04:53:36,360 --> 04:53:41,800
If they are hesitant to fight, and opt to surrender, would that not cause everything to fall apart?

6871
04:53:43,720 --> 04:53:44,240
Indeed.

6872
04:53:45,080 --> 04:53:49,500
And I do not intend to drag Lord Liu Biao, nor Lord Sun Quan.

6873
04:53:49,640 --> 04:53:51,100
I thought Lord Liu Biao died.

6874
04:53:52,560 --> 04:53:54,600
Even more so if they are unwilling to go to war.

6875
04:53:56,520 --> 04:54:02,640
I am fairly certain that, like us, those in Wu do not wish to see Jing fall into Cao Cao's hands.

6876
04:54:03,840 --> 04:54:07,040
They must know that he will be their enemy, eventually.

6877
04:54:07,800 --> 04:54:10,360
It may take time for them to decide...

6878
04:54:10,360 --> 04:54:12,120
But Caprize Saturn!

6879
04:54:13,360 --> 04:54:14,640
What happened to...

6880
04:54:14,640 --> 04:54:17,060
I would understand if they like...

6881
04:54:17,060 --> 04:54:17,920
They didn't have...

6882
04:54:17,920 --> 04:54:19,540
For one of the items, but it like...

6883
04:54:19,540 --> 04:54:20,980
They could have cancelled it right away.

6884
04:54:21,260 --> 04:54:21,900
That is the first step.

6885
04:54:27,950 --> 04:54:28,990
That's so weird.

6886
04:54:29,550 --> 04:54:29,730
Yeah!

6887
04:54:30,490 --> 04:54:31,250
I held it up.

6888
04:54:32,250 --> 04:54:33,050
Yeah, I know.

6889
04:54:33,230 --> 04:54:33,750
It was so weird.

6890
04:54:33,970 --> 04:54:35,250
I was not expecting that.

6891
04:54:38,070 --> 04:54:39,050
Very nice.

6892
04:54:40,650 --> 04:54:41,010
That's...

6893
04:54:41,010 --> 04:54:41,430
Plus 28.

6894
04:54:43,130 --> 04:54:43,930
Uh, I don't...

6895
04:54:43,930 --> 04:54:44,970
I'm not gonna upgrade these.

6896
04:54:45,170 --> 04:54:46,670
These are, like, bad upgrades.

6897
04:54:49,910 --> 04:54:51,090
I'm gonna go back to attack.

6898
04:55:02,690 --> 04:55:05,030
Yeah, but I didn't even think they would remake it, too.

6899
04:55:06,210 --> 04:55:07,670
Okay, it's two more battles, right?

6900
04:55:07,930 --> 04:55:08,790
Two more fights left?

6901
04:55:15,650 --> 04:55:16,650
Ah, it's you.

6902
04:55:17,470 --> 04:55:18,350
Sorry, but...

6903
04:55:18,350 --> 04:55:19,610
Lord Zuga Liang is away.

6904
04:55:19,950 --> 04:55:21,430
And he won't be returning for a while.

6905
04:55:24,920 --> 04:55:25,920
Did something happen?

6906
04:55:25,940 --> 04:55:26,600
Just a little earlier.

6907
04:55:26,840 --> 04:55:29,420
A man named Lu Su from Wu paid him a visit.

6908
04:55:29,760 --> 04:55:30,860
I'm gonna look at my meal, by the way.

6909
04:55:30,860 --> 04:55:32,580
He's been looking for a way of securing alliance with our Lord.

6910
04:55:32,580 --> 04:55:33,840
I don't know why this text is going on.

6911
04:55:33,940 --> 04:55:36,060
I didn't make sure my order doesn't get cancelled again.

6912
04:55:37,780 --> 04:55:38,420
I didn't make sure my order doesn't get cancelled again.

6913
04:55:38,420 --> 04:55:45,120
Although Wu is powerful in its own right, Cao Cao's faction far outstrips them, and having us as allies makes little difference.

6914
04:55:47,420 --> 04:55:52,440
Given the enormous gap in strength, many within Wu are advocating for surrender.

6915
04:55:54,200 --> 04:56:01,580
However, if Lord Zuga Liang's bold plan is to succeed, it is essential for the alliance to come to fruition.

6916
04:56:04,540 --> 04:56:09,580
As such, Lord Zuga Liang proposed that he himself would act as an envoy to Wu.

6917
04:56:15,490 --> 04:56:16,050
Okay.

6918
04:56:16,450 --> 04:56:17,550
Can you persuade them?

6919
04:56:18,470 --> 04:56:18,890
I don't know.

6920
04:56:19,430 --> 04:56:24,510
All I can say is that when I saw him go, I sensed a kind of aura from him.

6921
04:56:24,850 --> 04:56:27,230
Both fierce and resolute.

6922
04:56:27,690 --> 04:56:32,350
If anyone is capable of stirring Wu's military into action, it's him.

6923
04:56:33,350 --> 04:56:35,830
Now, we must trust in our strategist.

6924
04:56:36,410 --> 04:56:36,770
And wait.

6925
04:56:41,050 --> 04:56:43,670
Someone said a massive army- Oh, hey, Junfei.

6926
04:56:43,810 --> 04:56:44,610
Wait, Guan Yun?

6927
04:56:44,770 --> 04:56:45,730
Sorry, Junfei.

6928
04:56:47,830 --> 04:56:49,390
He's more important.

6929
04:56:49,690 --> 04:56:49,710
It's another war.

6930
04:56:50,130 --> 04:56:52,130
And a big one this time.

6931
04:56:59,670 --> 04:57:03,990
You did an impressive job protecting my brother in such dire circumstances.

6932
04:57:04,670 --> 04:57:07,310
Allow me to express my thanks once again.

6933
04:57:10,630 --> 04:57:12,530
You're impressive yourself, Guan Yun.

6934
04:57:12,610 --> 04:57:13,890
I saw the swings.

6935
04:57:14,270 --> 04:57:18,290
Thanks to your valiant efforts, we were able to avoid the enemy as we advanced.

6936
04:57:20,430 --> 04:57:28,030
Lord Lu Chi, the ruler of Cheng Sha, and an acquaintance of Lord Chu Gu Lian, has promised to lend us his aid.

6937
04:57:29,950 --> 04:57:35,290
But as I'm sure you know, Tao Tao's forces will neither bend nor break so easily.

6938
04:57:36,950 --> 04:57:42,950
The many talented officers under his banner will no doubt demonstrate their might and their cunning on the battlefield.

6939
04:57:44,790 --> 04:57:49,210
To call them the strongest army in the realm would be no exaggeration.

6940
04:57:49,810 --> 04:57:52,410
Our brother faces no greater threat than this.

6941
04:57:54,530 --> 04:57:57,670
However, we have no choice but to overcome them.

6942
04:57:58,570 --> 04:58:00,610
Brother now has an ambition to fulfill.

6943
04:58:00,910 --> 04:58:02,310
And people to protect.

6944
04:58:03,070 --> 04:58:06,270
All that remains is to make his dream a reality.

6945
04:58:10,410 --> 04:58:12,510
Don't worry, I got you Guan Yun.

6946
04:58:13,190 --> 04:58:14,530
I got you.

6947
04:58:14,710 --> 04:58:16,530
I'll make sure he doesn't lose.

6948
04:58:17,430 --> 04:58:21,670
And then I guess you can repay me by making sure I never existed.

6949
04:58:23,050 --> 04:58:27,870
I have to say, Cao Cao's persistence is becoming a real pain.

6950
04:58:28,630 --> 04:58:31,210
The situation was uncertain for a while.

6951
04:58:31,550 --> 04:58:35,190
But thanks to you, we made it to Zheng Sha in one piece.

6952
04:58:36,790 --> 04:58:37,690
You aren't hurt?

6953
04:58:38,030 --> 04:58:39,370
Of course not.

6954
04:58:40,110 --> 04:58:45,210
As if the great Cheng Fei of Yan could even be scratched by the likes of them.

6955
04:58:46,790 --> 04:58:50,410
We were outnumbered, but it was nothing we couldn't handle.

6956
04:58:50,410 --> 04:58:54,150
Definitely not compared to the battles brother has awaiting him.

6957
04:58:54,410 --> 04:58:58,850
I can barely even imagine how much work it's gonna take to build his ideal world.

6958
04:58:59,150 --> 04:59:02,330
A place where everyone can live as they wish.

6959
04:59:04,130 --> 04:59:06,770
I ain't nearly as cunning as Chu Ge Liang.

6960
04:59:07,190 --> 04:59:11,230
But if he points my blade in the right direction, that's where I'll swing.

6961
04:59:13,150 --> 04:59:14,390
Not nearly as...

6962
04:59:14,390 --> 04:59:17,850
Okay, you're putting yourself in a bit too high of a bar there.

6963
04:59:19,770 --> 04:59:28,510
Anyway, if brother's gonna be taking on overwhelming odds, I guess I'll just have to use my overwhelming mights to clear a path for him.

6964
04:59:29,050 --> 04:59:31,870
Well, that may be what I always do.

6965
04:59:32,150 --> 04:59:37,090
But having a clear goal in mind takes some of the weight off of my shoulders for some reason.

6966
04:59:38,250 --> 04:59:44,110
I don't really like the way Chu Ge Liang talks, but I guess I ought to give credit where credit is due.

6967
04:59:47,170 --> 04:59:50,270
He's literally the one brain cell in our entire army.

6968
04:59:50,750 --> 04:59:51,290
It's...

6969
04:59:51,290 --> 04:59:52,670
a little concerning.

6970
04:59:54,630 --> 04:59:56,050
Just a little bit.

6971
05:00:03,710 --> 05:00:07,150
It pains me to admit it, but I was in over my head.

6972
05:00:08,310 --> 05:00:12,870
My desire to lead the people to freedom led to some losing their lives.

6973
05:00:13,830 --> 05:00:14,270
Even so...

6974
05:00:15,270 --> 05:00:16,710
I just had to try...

6975
05:00:16,710 --> 05:00:18,190
Still being made, it's being prepared!

6976
05:00:18,610 --> 05:00:20,510
The people of Jing wanted me to lead them.

6977
05:00:20,610 --> 05:00:21,570
I understand, how did it get cancelled?

6978
05:00:23,070 --> 05:00:24,030
What happened?

6979
05:00:24,030 --> 05:00:26,270
If I had left them behind...

6980
05:00:27,030 --> 05:00:29,790
I could never again have spoken of my ideal...

6981
05:00:29,790 --> 05:00:31,290
For a world in which...

6982
05:00:31,290 --> 05:00:33,450
I could be eating lasagna right now while watching all these cutscenes!

6983
05:00:37,260 --> 05:00:38,820
He had no other choice.

6984
05:00:39,180 --> 05:00:40,440
I suppose that's true.

6985
05:00:41,040 --> 05:00:42,420
I must think of it that way.

6986
05:00:42,420 --> 05:00:43,080
We'll never know.

6987
05:00:43,620 --> 05:00:44,980
Our troubles have yet to pass.

6988
05:00:46,180 --> 05:00:47,740
We may feel the same lasagna.

6989
05:00:48,360 --> 05:00:49,780
If we are to rout Sao-Sao.

6990
05:00:50,780 --> 05:00:51,300
Yet...

6991
05:00:51,760 --> 05:00:54,060
I shall fight to the very end.

6992
05:00:54,520 --> 05:00:56,260
And fulfill my aspirations.

6993
05:00:57,260 --> 05:00:59,480
For the sake of those who are devoted to me.

6994
05:01:00,380 --> 05:01:03,360
I suppose that sounds like something Lord Cao Cao would say.

6995
05:01:05,100 --> 05:01:08,600
Perhaps it is only now that I bear the weight of these lives on my shoulders.

6996
05:01:09,060 --> 05:01:12,180
That I am able to stand shoulder to shoulder with such a giant.

6997
05:01:12,860 --> 05:01:14,560
At any rate...

6998
05:01:14,560 --> 05:01:15,760
Let us wait for Chu Ge Liang.

6999
05:01:16,740 --> 05:01:19,860
I trust that his return shall herald an alliance with Wu.

7000
05:01:22,640 --> 05:01:23,200
Yeah!

7001
05:01:23,640 --> 05:01:23,700
Yeah!

7002
05:01:23,700 --> 05:01:25,380
Wait, is the Battle of Redcliff next?

7003
05:01:26,860 --> 05:01:27,880
Oh my god.

7004
05:01:28,120 --> 05:01:29,020
That's actually my favorite...

7005
05:01:29,560 --> 05:01:29,980
Battle.

7006
05:01:30,340 --> 05:01:33,580
Like, I think it's like a lot of people's favorite battle slash event.

7007
05:01:33,760 --> 05:01:34,860
Because it's such a...

7008
05:01:35,800 --> 05:01:36,360
Like...

7009
05:01:36,360 --> 05:01:40,160
Crazy strategy and iconic moment in the Green Kingdom's history.

7010
05:01:40,940 --> 05:01:42,060
How went negotiations?

7011
05:01:42,780 --> 05:01:47,640
The fleet commanded by Wu's general, Zhou Yu, awaits at Fankou.

7012
05:01:47,860 --> 05:01:50,520
It's like literally THE battle in Three Kingdoms.

7013
05:01:51,440 --> 05:01:56,700
Before long, they shall take up arms against Cao Cao's advance force.

7014
05:01:57,660 --> 05:01:58,320
Then that means...

7015
05:01:59,620 --> 05:02:00,420
Indeed.

7016
05:02:00,420 --> 05:02:04,460
Lord Suan Chuan has decided to join hands with Lord Liu Bei.

7017
05:02:04,680 --> 05:02:05,480
Oh, here's Lu Su.

7018
05:02:06,900 --> 05:02:08,440
I don't know who he is.

7019
05:02:09,780 --> 05:02:11,600
I have no idea who that guy is.

7020
05:02:11,840 --> 05:02:13,560
You have my sincere thanks, Lord Lu Su.

7021
05:02:14,540 --> 05:02:17,740
I fear that without Chu Ge Liang's tenacity...

7022
05:02:18,420 --> 05:02:21,360
Wu may have long since chosen surrender.

7023
05:02:22,420 --> 05:02:23,500
Tenacity, you say?

7024
05:02:24,540 --> 05:02:29,260
I suppose it was necessary to draw those advocating surrender into a debate.

7025
05:02:30,420 --> 05:02:33,140
He acted as quite the villain, to put it lightly.

7026
05:02:34,320 --> 05:02:35,640
No need to hold back.

7027
05:02:36,260 --> 05:02:37,600
I'm sure he wasn't acting.

7028
05:02:38,420 --> 05:02:41,620
After all, he's always had a disagreeable personality.

7029
05:02:44,000 --> 05:02:45,980
We're in front of the man himself.

7030
05:02:47,080 --> 05:02:49,480
Allow me to keep my opinions to myself.

7031
05:02:50,460 --> 05:02:56,580
Even if we've secured an alliance with Wu, the fact remains that our forces are scarce in number.

7032
05:02:57,660 --> 05:03:02,460
That Lord Suan Chuan decided to fight with us means he must have seen some chance of winning.

7033
05:03:05,420 --> 05:03:06,660
Where's Lord Suan Chuan?

7034
05:03:08,200 --> 05:03:09,700
Why didn't he come over?

7035
05:03:10,160 --> 05:03:12,880
Is he scared of dying like his brothers and dad?

7036
05:03:13,800 --> 05:03:16,140
We will intercept the enemy on the river.

7037
05:03:16,860 --> 05:03:19,180
After discussions with Lord Zhou Yu...

7038
05:03:19,180 --> 05:03:22,180
Honestly, I won't be surprised if Suan Chuan becomes like a...

7039
05:03:22,180 --> 05:03:23,680
Like just a shut-in after that.

7040
05:03:23,840 --> 05:03:26,240
Like his dad and brother literally died in war.

7041
05:03:26,420 --> 05:03:27,720
Why would he do that to himself?

7042
05:03:28,660 --> 05:03:30,160
He should just stay in his...

7043
05:03:30,160 --> 05:03:31,240
Stay in this castle.

7044
05:03:55,600 --> 05:03:56,280
Oh.

7045
05:03:56,340 --> 05:03:56,920
Oh, is it Tuan?

7046
05:03:57,480 --> 05:03:57,740
Tuan?

7047
05:03:57,740 --> 05:03:58,780
Not Quan?

7048
05:04:00,720 --> 05:04:03,460
That was the English pronunciation in the Dynasty...

7049
05:04:03,460 --> 05:04:05,960
In the Dynasty Warriors original series?

7050
05:04:06,880 --> 05:04:07,480
So...

7051
05:04:07,480 --> 05:04:09,520
It's just an old habit.

7052
05:04:09,740 --> 05:04:12,380
Like how I used to pronounce Tau Tau as Kau Kau.

7053
05:04:12,720 --> 05:04:14,240
Because they used to call him Kau Kau.

7054
05:04:14,960 --> 05:04:16,740
Yet, on the water...

7055
05:04:16,740 --> 05:04:19,680
Such caution will only work against him.

7056
05:04:20,380 --> 05:04:22,220
That massive fleet...

7057
05:04:22,220 --> 05:04:24,680
Tired from the long journey...

7058
05:04:24,680 --> 05:04:25,960
Will be disorganized.

7059
05:04:26,580 --> 05:04:28,240
Fatigue will lower morale.

7060
05:04:29,000 --> 05:04:31,160
And the young sea will hamper their maneuvers.

7061
05:04:31,240 --> 05:04:31,600
Yeah.

7062
05:04:32,000 --> 05:04:34,280
I miss when Tau Kau was Kau Kau.

7063
05:04:35,050 --> 05:04:36,560
And Kau...

7064
05:04:36,560 --> 05:04:41,500
Kau Kau and Kau P. Oh yeah, Kau P. I forgot!

7065
05:04:42,360 --> 05:04:47,880
So it was Kau P. I miss those days.

7066
05:04:49,140 --> 05:04:51,380
The English dub was...

7067
05:04:53,220 --> 05:04:55,600
The English dub was truly...

7068
05:04:56,000 --> 05:04:57,240
Was truly amazing.

7069
05:04:57,240 --> 05:04:58,320
We simply must.

7070
05:04:59,120 --> 05:05:00,920
Sorry, they're talking about politics.

7071
05:05:01,460 --> 05:05:01,840
Our lives depend on it.

7072
05:05:01,840 --> 05:05:02,080
And I...

7073
05:05:02,080 --> 05:05:03,620
I miss my...

7074
05:05:03,620 --> 05:05:05,260
I miss my dating sim route.

7075
05:05:05,820 --> 05:05:06,280
Yes.

7076
05:05:06,900 --> 05:05:08,000
It is as you say.

7077
05:05:08,860 --> 05:05:11,240
All the more reason for us to hurry to the rendezvous.

7078
05:05:11,400 --> 05:05:12,320
And I miss my...

7079
05:05:12,320 --> 05:05:14,060
And I'm waiting for my lasagna.

7080
05:05:15,040 --> 05:05:17,420
I'm thinking about lasagna right now.

7081
05:05:23,260 --> 05:05:23,820
Phoenix!

7082
05:05:27,840 --> 05:05:28,960
Well, well.

7083
05:05:29,460 --> 05:05:32,280
So you're the one to call on me this time, Chu Ge Liang.

7084
05:05:33,020 --> 05:05:37,940
I distinctly express that I've no intention of putting my neck on the line.

7085
05:05:38,180 --> 05:05:39,120
Or have you forgotten?

7086
05:05:40,000 --> 05:05:46,100
Even for me, the very idea of dragging a dear friend into battle pains me to no end.

7087
05:05:46,940 --> 05:05:49,860
All the more reason to leave then, don't you think?

7088
05:05:50,200 --> 05:05:54,520
I have no desire to ally with Wu, or any of you.

7089
05:05:55,520 --> 05:05:57,240
Are you sure about that?

7090
05:05:58,340 --> 05:06:01,460
Cao Cao is constantly seeking talented individuals.

7091
05:06:02,220 --> 05:06:04,680
He may already have his sights set on you.

7092
05:06:05,420 --> 05:06:10,160
If Jing falls into his grasp, your days of peace are over.

7093
05:06:10,920 --> 05:06:15,980
You'd be forced into a life of vagabonding, or supplication to Cao Cao.

7094
05:06:16,920 --> 05:06:18,440
Is that a threat?

7095
05:06:19,060 --> 05:06:19,640
Sorry.

7096
05:06:20,000 --> 05:06:21,940
But that won't work on me.

7097
05:06:22,840 --> 05:06:25,880
The capture of Jing is well within my calculations.

7098
05:06:27,020 --> 05:06:27,820
I see.

7099
05:06:28,320 --> 05:06:30,000
Then you leave me no choice.

7100
05:06:30,680 --> 05:06:34,400
I didn't want to have to use this last resort, but here we are.

7101
05:06:35,120 --> 05:06:35,600
Wait.

7102
05:06:35,940 --> 05:06:36,700
Last resort?

7103
05:06:37,020 --> 05:06:38,440
Am I threatening him?

7104
05:06:38,740 --> 05:06:40,220
Well, I'll be damned.

7105
05:06:40,620 --> 05:06:43,620
So they've got you doing their dirty work for them, have they?

7106
05:06:45,080 --> 05:06:46,960
You're close with him, are you not?

7107
05:06:48,060 --> 05:06:50,200
Perhaps you could put in a good word for him.

7108
05:06:53,180 --> 05:06:55,000
They're like, that's it.

7109
05:06:55,220 --> 05:06:57,020
We're doing a honeypot now.

7110
05:06:57,020 --> 05:06:57,480
Yeah!

7111
05:06:57,920 --> 05:07:00,180
I'm gonna bring in the big guns.

7112
05:07:00,560 --> 05:07:01,560
You can't...

7113
05:07:01,560 --> 05:07:03,880
You can't say no to him.

7114
05:07:09,600 --> 05:07:11,740
We really need your help, Anton.

7115
05:07:12,540 --> 05:07:12,820
Oops.

7116
05:07:13,060 --> 05:07:14,580
Did I just drop something?

7117
05:07:14,980 --> 05:07:16,420
Let me just...

7118
05:07:16,420 --> 05:07:18,760
Pick it up real quick.

7119
05:07:22,300 --> 05:07:25,120
I almost feel guilty for...

7120
05:07:25,760 --> 05:07:27,000
Causing you to be...

7121
05:07:27,700 --> 05:07:28,520
Dragged out here.

7122
05:07:30,260 --> 05:07:33,260
If it were anyone but you...

7123
05:07:33,260 --> 05:07:38,240
I don't think I could ever bring myself to refuse if it meant damaging your reputation.

7124
05:07:38,480 --> 05:07:39,980
If only it was anyone else.

7125
05:07:40,820 --> 05:07:42,940
You're as insidious as ever, Chuga.

7126
05:07:43,320 --> 05:07:44,840
Did it just cause of me?

7127
05:07:45,120 --> 05:07:46,780
He literally was like...

7128
05:07:46,780 --> 05:07:47,460
Why?

7129
05:07:47,900 --> 05:07:50,180
You know I can't say no to him in this space.

7130
05:07:50,180 --> 05:07:51,720
Your support is most appreciated, Pengtong.

7131
05:07:52,300 --> 05:07:53,320
It's not working.

7132
05:07:53,320 --> 05:07:55,740
Just remember that I will support you as I see fit.

7133
05:07:55,920 --> 05:07:57,520
And at my discretion.

7134
05:07:58,660 --> 05:07:58,900
Still...

7135
05:07:58,900 --> 05:08:02,340
And if you say yes, he'll show up in your room tonight.

7136
05:08:02,880 --> 05:08:04,740
Don't you worry about that.

7137
05:08:06,940 --> 05:08:08,380
Fate to black.

7138
05:08:12,960 --> 05:08:14,160
That night...

7139
05:08:14,160 --> 05:08:14,780
Wait a minute.

7140
05:08:14,980 --> 05:08:15,780
Where am I?

7141
05:08:17,240 --> 05:08:18,160
Where am I?

7142
05:08:18,400 --> 05:08:18,840
Okay.

7143
05:08:19,640 --> 05:08:21,620
I need to be sure where I am.

7144
05:08:22,020 --> 05:08:23,160
But I have something urgent to discuss with you.

7145
05:08:23,340 --> 05:08:24,620
Wait a minute.

7146
05:08:26,320 --> 05:08:27,500
And let us speak.

7147
05:08:28,180 --> 05:08:29,940
I got... I got the worry.

7148
05:08:30,280 --> 05:08:31,880
There is a task that I wish to entrust to you.

7149
05:08:32,360 --> 05:08:34,400
A highly significant one at that.

7150
05:08:34,880 --> 05:08:36,080
Alright, I'm checking my food.

7151
05:08:36,740 --> 05:08:38,460
The plan I shared with Lord...

7152
05:08:38,460 --> 05:08:39,420
Okay, it's being picked up again!

7153
05:08:40,040 --> 05:08:41,920
Setting fire to Cao Cao's ships.

7154
05:08:43,220 --> 05:08:45,680
Such a strategy is no assured victory.

7155
05:08:45,680 --> 05:08:46,300
Alright guys, sorry.

7156
05:08:46,380 --> 05:08:48,520
I need to like, look at this just to make sure it's picked up.

7157
05:08:48,700 --> 05:08:49,980
There is one major hole in the plan.

7158
05:08:51,380 --> 05:08:52,040
What is it?

7159
05:08:52,260 --> 05:08:53,720
Cao Cao's forces will march southward.

7160
05:08:54,000 --> 05:08:57,440
And thus, they will naturally take up camp to our north.

7161
05:08:57,460 --> 05:08:58,840
I need to make sure it doesn't get cancelled.

7162
05:08:58,840 --> 05:08:59,360
This is...

7163
05:08:59,360 --> 05:09:04,300
The winds of the Yangtze River Basin blow from the west and the north.

7164
05:09:04,940 --> 05:09:09,920
But if we simply set Cao Cao's ships place, the northern wind will scatter the flames.

7165
05:09:10,020 --> 05:09:12,020
Doesn't it like, take money from...

7166
05:09:13,380 --> 05:09:13,940
Like...

7167
05:09:13,940 --> 05:09:15,040
No, it's a different one.

7168
05:09:15,820 --> 05:09:17,320
Does it take money from...

7169
05:09:17,320 --> 05:09:19,320
From them if they like, cancel the order?

7170
05:09:24,670 --> 05:09:27,110
If the winds were to shift...

7171
05:09:27,110 --> 05:09:27,330
Indeed.

7172
05:09:28,050 --> 05:09:30,950
We must detect that exact moment.

7173
05:09:31,850 --> 05:09:33,410
And your power...

7174
05:09:33,850 --> 05:09:35,850
The power to read the wind...

7175
05:09:35,850 --> 05:09:38,730
Is up to the challenge, is it not?

7176
05:09:39,490 --> 05:09:42,530
Perhaps due to the climate or terrain...

7177
05:09:42,850 --> 05:09:47,950
A southern wind sometimes blows down from the cliffs of Chibi at night.

7178
05:09:49,910 --> 05:09:52,870
I need you to sense that change coming.

7179
05:09:52,950 --> 05:09:53,350
Wait, me?

7180
05:09:53,610 --> 05:09:55,810
And give the signal to loose our flames.

7181
05:09:57,270 --> 05:09:59,110
Oh yeah, he's gonna perform some...

7182
05:09:59,810 --> 05:10:00,310
Magic.

7183
05:10:01,230 --> 05:10:03,090
Or he's gonna change the wind.

7184
05:10:05,870 --> 05:10:06,850
How do you like the flames?

7185
05:10:07,210 --> 05:10:09,390
Lord Zhou Yu is making the necessary preparations.

7186
05:10:10,190 --> 05:10:12,830
You focus on forecasting the winds.

7187
05:10:14,070 --> 05:10:17,830
This is a vital task I could entrust to no other.

7188
05:10:18,810 --> 05:10:19,490
Perhaps...

7189
05:10:19,490 --> 05:10:20,070
I...

7190
05:10:20,070 --> 05:10:22,230
Shouldn't say this, but...

7191
05:10:22,950 --> 05:10:23,850
Wait, me?

7192
05:10:23,850 --> 05:10:25,350
We're counting on that power of yours.

7193
05:10:26,810 --> 05:10:28,350
Victory or defeat...

7194
05:10:28,910 --> 05:10:29,490
Is in your hands.

7195
05:10:29,770 --> 05:10:30,810
Oh my god, that's a lot of pressure.

7196
05:10:31,250 --> 05:10:32,830
I'll do it for you, Maoshi.

7197
05:10:35,030 --> 05:10:35,970
Don't worry, sorry.

7198
05:10:36,230 --> 05:10:38,410
I'm not moving because I'm making sure that...

7199
05:10:38,410 --> 05:10:40,170
They don't take my lasagna.

7200
05:10:41,110 --> 05:10:42,590
Please, I'm so hungry.

7201
05:10:43,230 --> 05:10:45,390
All I want is lasagna.

7202
05:10:46,410 --> 05:10:48,350
I just want my...

7203
05:10:48,350 --> 05:10:49,790
Oh, guys, I have a...

7204
05:10:50,890 --> 05:10:52,610
I have a meeting with Pantone.

7205
05:10:53,350 --> 05:10:54,670
I think I have to...

7206
05:10:54,910 --> 05:10:56,270
Keep my bargain.

7207
05:10:57,590 --> 05:10:59,430
I'm so hungry, John.

7208
05:11:05,560 --> 05:11:06,920
You've truly...

7209
05:11:06,920 --> 05:11:10,040
Brought a storm upon my head this time, eh?

7210
05:11:13,570 --> 05:11:14,590
A storm?

7211
05:11:14,930 --> 05:11:15,750
Forgive me.

7212
05:11:16,230 --> 05:11:16,910
Honestly...

7213
05:11:17,470 --> 05:11:21,810
I've been running this way and that, thanks to your exploits.

7214
05:11:22,750 --> 05:11:26,770
Well, I admit, I don't mean to seriously admonish you.

7215
05:11:27,010 --> 05:11:29,130
Rather, I'm actually quite thankful.

7216
05:11:29,870 --> 05:11:36,090
You gave me the final push I needed to get my thoughts in order after being lost for a long time.

7217
05:11:37,110 --> 05:11:42,110
I must confess, I've been perplexed by the issue for some time now.

7218
05:11:42,970 --> 05:11:45,870
You're striving to become someone.

7219
05:11:46,770 --> 05:11:49,050
Whereas I haven't even been trying.

7220
05:11:50,330 --> 05:11:52,610
I've just been existing in obscurity.

7221
05:11:52,810 --> 05:11:54,450
Well, you still have a reputation, though.

7222
05:11:54,470 --> 05:11:56,750
I used to struggle greatly in communicating...

7223
05:11:56,750 --> 05:12:00,830
People still call him the phoenix, even though he's trying to stay in secret.

7224
05:12:02,170 --> 05:12:06,110
It was then that Master Shui Ching took me under his wing.

7225
05:12:06,610 --> 05:12:10,230
I had begun seeing the world as unfairly obtuse.

7226
05:12:11,090 --> 05:12:14,010
Even when my efforts were finally recognized.

7227
05:12:14,090 --> 05:12:14,870
Please pick up my order.

7228
05:12:15,870 --> 05:12:16,310
I...

7229
05:12:16,310 --> 05:12:20,430
Found the idea of choosing my own path burdensome.

7230
05:12:20,610 --> 05:12:22,130
Let alone...

7231
05:12:22,130 --> 05:12:23,410
Actually walking it.

7232
05:12:24,530 --> 05:12:26,730
It was thanks to you that I...

7233
05:12:26,730 --> 05:12:27,330
No, he is!

7234
05:12:27,390 --> 05:12:28,070
He's a real...

7235
05:12:28,070 --> 05:12:28,550
He dies.

7236
05:12:29,190 --> 05:12:31,010
I don't know how you miss...

7237
05:12:31,010 --> 05:12:33,770
Kept telling everybody that he dies later.

7238
05:12:35,950 --> 05:12:37,010
I've been...

7239
05:12:37,010 --> 05:12:40,210
I've been very, very explicit about the fact that...

7240
05:12:40,210 --> 05:12:41,930
He does die later.

7241
05:12:45,290 --> 05:12:46,610
I'm glad I was able to help.

7242
05:12:46,830 --> 05:12:47,650
More than you could imagine.

7243
05:12:48,470 --> 05:12:51,030
I dread to think of the state I'd be in...

7244
05:12:51,030 --> 05:12:52,390
Without your...

7245
05:12:52,390 --> 05:12:53,790
Sorry, yeah, you didn't have your jingle jangle.

7246
05:12:53,790 --> 05:12:53,950
What?

7247
05:12:53,950 --> 05:12:54,610
We give...

7248
05:12:54,610 --> 05:12:56,490
And receive...

7249
05:12:56,490 --> 05:12:58,910
Determines our fates...

7250
05:12:58,910 --> 05:12:59,570
With one another.

7251
05:13:00,510 --> 05:13:01,830
Master Shui Jing...

7252
05:13:02,490 --> 05:13:03,330
Told me that.

7253
05:13:04,570 --> 05:13:07,710
You hold so many bonds with different people...

7254
05:13:07,710 --> 05:13:09,610
And have discovered your own path.

7255
05:13:10,350 --> 05:13:11,970
I think others see you...

7256
05:13:12,310 --> 05:13:14,450
As one who provides guidance.

7257
05:13:14,750 --> 05:13:15,530
He picked it up!

7258
05:13:15,530 --> 05:13:17,070
It may take different forms...

7259
05:13:17,070 --> 05:13:17,410
What?

7260
05:13:17,850 --> 05:13:20,290
But you have the gratitude of those around you.

7261
05:13:20,470 --> 05:13:21,650
He picked up my order!

7262
05:13:22,130 --> 05:13:22,250
I know that to be true.

7263
05:13:22,650 --> 05:13:23,710
As I'm one such person...

7264
05:13:23,710 --> 05:13:25,450
What happened to my first lasagna?

7265
05:13:26,010 --> 05:13:27,290
I hope that we can stay close...

7266
05:13:27,290 --> 05:13:28,150
Sorry, Penton.

7267
05:13:28,530 --> 05:13:30,530
As we continue upon our own paths...

7268
05:13:31,150 --> 05:13:33,710
The ones we've chosen for ourselves...

7269
05:13:33,710 --> 05:13:35,090
Without hesitation.

7270
05:13:37,690 --> 05:13:39,910
He's like driving over right now!

7271
05:13:40,190 --> 05:13:40,650
I'm sorry.

7272
05:13:40,810 --> 05:13:42,330
This entire interaction with him...

7273
05:13:42,330 --> 05:13:43,850
I was not paying attention.

7274
05:13:44,050 --> 05:13:46,270
My lasagna was so much more important.

7275
05:13:47,590 --> 05:13:48,630
I'm sorry.

7276
05:13:49,130 --> 05:13:51,030
I'm just gonna give you money.

7277
05:13:51,350 --> 05:13:51,730
I...

7278
05:13:53,830 --> 05:13:55,550
Wait, but he's not driving!

7279
05:13:56,070 --> 05:13:57,650
Why aren't you driving?

7280
05:13:58,130 --> 05:13:59,130
Wait, where do I go?

7281
05:14:00,390 --> 05:14:01,030
I'm...

7282
05:14:01,710 --> 05:14:03,130
Sorry, I'm so hungry.

7283
05:14:03,710 --> 05:14:04,050
I...

7284
05:14:04,530 --> 05:14:06,630
I'm so hungry right now.

7285
05:14:08,670 --> 05:14:09,150
Okay.

7286
05:14:09,530 --> 05:14:10,250
Sun Quan.

7287
05:14:11,010 --> 05:14:12,970
Training of Lu Bei's forces.

7288
05:14:14,750 --> 05:14:16,950
Where the fuck is Daoyun?

7289
05:14:18,690 --> 05:14:20,790
Wait, why is the car not moving?

7290
05:14:24,630 --> 05:14:26,070
Oh wait, he's gonna send me a letter.

7291
05:14:26,210 --> 05:14:27,410
And then give me an address, right?

7292
05:14:27,570 --> 05:14:27,910
Yeah, okay.

7293
05:14:28,250 --> 05:14:29,370
I wish to thank you.

7294
05:14:30,070 --> 05:14:31,850
I'd like to thank you for Changbang.

7295
05:14:31,850 --> 05:14:34,050
And at the end, I'm much to ask.

7296
05:14:34,350 --> 05:14:35,430
May I come to see you?

7297
05:14:35,850 --> 05:14:38,950
There are some things I would like to bring with me as well.

7298
05:14:39,310 --> 05:14:40,890
I know I may be asking a lot.

7299
05:14:41,150 --> 05:14:42,170
But it all...

7300
05:14:42,170 --> 05:14:44,010
It's all because I wish to spend...

7301
05:14:44,010 --> 05:14:46,390
A memorable time together?

7302
05:14:47,230 --> 05:14:48,330
Okay, maybe he...

7303
05:14:48,330 --> 05:14:48,950
Okay, sorry.

7304
05:14:49,110 --> 05:14:49,310
Okay.

7305
05:14:49,850 --> 05:14:50,350
I'll come...

7306
05:14:50,350 --> 05:14:50,870
I'll be back.

7307
05:14:50,870 --> 05:14:51,930
This is...

7308
05:14:51,930 --> 05:14:53,210
I swear to God.

7309
05:14:53,470 --> 05:14:55,150
After my memorable time with Daoyun.

7310
05:14:55,270 --> 05:14:56,710
I swear to God.

7311
05:14:57,630 --> 05:14:57,970
If...

7312
05:14:58,990 --> 05:15:01,770
If after my memorable time with him.

7313
05:15:01,950 --> 05:15:03,550
And then like...

7314
05:15:03,550 --> 05:15:05,970
And then like my order gets cancelled.

7315
05:15:06,250 --> 05:15:08,070
I will not be happy.

7316
05:15:11,470 --> 05:15:12,310
I...

7317
05:15:12,310 --> 05:15:13,150
I...

7318
05:15:13,150 --> 05:15:13,230
I...

7319
05:15:13,230 --> 05:15:14,430
I came back for this.

7320
05:15:14,710 --> 05:15:15,290
Okay.

7321
05:15:15,710 --> 05:15:18,590
I will be very unhappy.

7322
05:15:24,010 --> 05:15:26,170
I swear to God.

7323
05:15:28,410 --> 05:15:30,570
If he takes this away from me.

7324
05:15:30,810 --> 05:15:32,270
If I lose my lasagna.

7325
05:15:33,250 --> 05:15:34,290
Because of Daoyun.

7326
05:15:35,490 --> 05:15:36,010
Me...

7327
05:15:36,010 --> 05:15:36,590
Me mad.

7328
05:15:38,790 --> 05:15:39,310
Okay.

7329
05:15:39,350 --> 05:15:41,510
Where the fuck is he though?

7330
05:15:42,750 --> 05:15:44,090
There is the battle.

7331
05:15:44,690 --> 05:15:45,310
Oh my god.

7332
05:15:45,410 --> 05:15:46,330
Wait, that looks so cool.

7333
05:15:47,410 --> 05:15:48,610
That shit looks insane.

7334
05:15:48,790 --> 05:15:49,370
Oh, there he is.

7335
05:15:52,110 --> 05:15:53,410
Surprise quiz time!

7336
05:15:54,670 --> 05:15:56,250
I know a couple people who went...

7337
05:15:56,250 --> 05:15:57,190
Alright, what do you wanna do?

7338
05:15:58,050 --> 05:15:58,570
Daoyun.

7339
05:16:01,170 --> 05:16:02,670
Oh, late night drinking!

7340
05:16:04,810 --> 05:16:06,550
Thank you for your help at Chungban.

7341
05:16:07,170 --> 05:16:08,910
Without you, all would have been lost.

7342
05:16:11,550 --> 05:16:14,450
I don't know if I would have survived without your help there.

7343
05:16:18,290 --> 05:16:18,810
Truly.

7344
05:16:19,830 --> 05:16:20,350
You're...

7345
05:16:23,090 --> 05:16:25,590
Being with you made me feel so safe.

7346
05:16:25,930 --> 05:16:28,170
I felt that way from the moment we met.

7347
05:16:28,430 --> 05:16:28,530
Oh!

7348
05:16:28,850 --> 05:16:29,410
That's me!

7349
05:16:32,590 --> 05:16:33,490
Oh my god.

7350
05:16:33,870 --> 05:16:35,270
Oh my god, we're getting drunk together.

7351
05:16:37,990 --> 05:16:38,890
Just noticed.

7352
05:16:39,530 --> 05:16:40,310
Holy shit!

7353
05:16:40,810 --> 05:16:41,050
Alright.

7354
05:16:41,730 --> 05:16:43,530
I feel the same way.

7355
05:16:43,530 --> 05:16:45,670
Thank you, friend.

7356
05:16:45,670 --> 05:16:45,750
Thank you, friend.

7357
05:16:46,650 --> 05:16:46,730
No.

7358
05:16:47,550 --> 05:16:49,570
Maybe partner is a bad word.

7359
05:16:49,830 --> 05:16:50,050
Oh!

7360
05:16:50,470 --> 05:16:50,830
Oh!

7361
05:16:51,310 --> 05:16:54,210
I try to believe that I will never again meet such a kindred spirit.

7362
05:16:54,510 --> 05:16:54,950
Oh!

7363
05:16:55,870 --> 05:16:56,470
Already?

7364
05:16:57,310 --> 05:16:57,910
Partner?

7365
05:16:59,470 --> 05:17:00,490
Domestic partners?

7366
05:17:01,330 --> 05:17:01,590
What?

7367
05:17:01,790 --> 05:17:02,750
Wait, Fade of Black?

7368
05:17:03,030 --> 05:17:03,250
Wait!

7369
05:17:03,670 --> 05:17:05,130
What happened in between?

7370
05:17:06,670 --> 05:17:09,030
What happened in between that fade?

7371
05:17:09,310 --> 05:17:11,670
I like the real...

7372
05:17:11,670 --> 05:17:12,690
What did happen?

7373
05:17:13,050 --> 05:17:15,510
What did he say when he was...

7374
05:17:15,510 --> 05:17:17,010
What did he say and do?

7375
05:17:17,270 --> 05:17:18,930
And during this...

7376
05:17:18,930 --> 05:17:21,070
I like the real you.

7377
05:17:21,070 --> 05:17:21,330
What did he do?

7378
05:17:22,010 --> 05:17:22,450
What?

7379
05:17:22,450 --> 05:17:23,170
What did I do?

7380
05:17:23,390 --> 05:17:23,830
Exactly!

7381
05:17:24,050 --> 05:17:25,050
I want to know too!

7382
05:17:25,510 --> 05:17:25,530
It's okay.

7383
05:17:25,550 --> 05:17:26,290
You can tell me.

7384
05:17:26,750 --> 05:17:28,350
Nothing you say will bother me.

7385
05:17:29,070 --> 05:17:30,610
Did I do something in my sleep?

7386
05:17:31,370 --> 05:17:33,870
If so, that too was the real me.

7387
05:17:37,470 --> 05:17:38,350
He's like...

7388
05:17:38,350 --> 05:17:40,250
Whatever I did drunk, I meant it.

7389
05:17:44,110 --> 05:17:48,530
And I was trying to put into words why it was that I sought after you and Lord Liu Bei.

7390
05:17:51,750 --> 05:17:53,410
But I've just realized...

7391
05:17:57,030 --> 05:17:59,070
His generosity truly knows...

7392
05:17:59,070 --> 05:18:00,070
Why are we talking...

7393
05:18:00,070 --> 05:18:00,650
I like how our...

7394
05:18:00,650 --> 05:18:01,790
Our bed talk...

7395
05:18:01,790 --> 05:18:04,430
His bed talk is that he has to talk about Liu Bei.

7396
05:18:05,470 --> 05:18:08,190
This is where I can truly be myself.

7397
05:18:10,510 --> 05:18:11,370
He's like...

7398
05:18:11,370 --> 05:18:15,870
That was great, but let me tell you about our great Lord Liu Bei and his benevolence.

7399
05:18:17,670 --> 05:18:19,910
Being with you really is like a dream.

7400
05:18:19,910 --> 05:18:23,650
I hope we will continue to have many nights like this one.

7401
05:18:25,990 --> 05:18:27,590
He wants more!

7402
05:18:28,950 --> 05:18:30,090
That was like...

7403
05:18:30,090 --> 05:18:32,150
He had a really good time.

7404
05:18:32,490 --> 05:18:33,510
He had it...

7405
05:18:33,510 --> 05:18:34,430
Oh my god!

7406
05:18:36,670 --> 05:18:37,310
Alright.

7407
05:18:37,950 --> 05:18:38,770
That was worth it.

7408
05:18:38,870 --> 05:18:39,470
What's going on?

7409
05:18:39,570 --> 05:18:39,990
Okay.

7410
05:18:40,270 --> 05:18:40,990
It's coming!

7411
05:18:41,630 --> 05:18:43,690
What happened to my lasagna?

7412
05:18:43,690 --> 05:18:44,910
What?

7413
05:18:45,830 --> 05:18:47,730
It's actually arriving!

7414
05:18:47,990 --> 05:18:50,070
What did he do to my lasagna?

7415
05:18:50,490 --> 05:18:51,530
I need to know!

7416
05:18:51,910 --> 05:18:54,110
What did the first guy do?

7417
05:18:55,130 --> 05:18:56,850
This is important!

7418
05:18:56,850 --> 05:19:00,890
What did the first guy do to my lasagna?

7419
05:19:03,430 --> 05:19:06,610
I think he actually ate my lasagna!

7420
05:19:07,030 --> 05:19:09,830
Because this lasagna... I ordered the same thing!

7421
05:19:12,650 --> 05:19:13,950
Oh, that's beautiful.

7422
05:19:15,230 --> 05:19:17,390
I literally ordered the same thing.

7423
05:19:17,990 --> 05:19:19,870
I didn't change my order.

7424
05:19:21,070 --> 05:19:23,110
There's no way he didn't eat it.

7425
05:19:27,010 --> 05:19:31,230
It was a good... I ordered it from a good lasagna place too.

7426
05:19:36,630 --> 05:19:38,650
Does it not take money from him?

7427
05:19:38,890 --> 05:19:40,510
I got refund though.

7428
05:19:48,700 --> 05:19:52,180
Two married dragoons talking about Toki before I met!

7429
05:19:52,720 --> 05:19:54,360
Shuriko, thank you for the super chat.

7430
05:19:54,520 --> 05:19:55,340
Thank you, thank you.

7431
05:19:55,800 --> 05:19:56,900
Oh, there's Joyu.

7432
05:19:57,780 --> 05:20:00,460
And his new roommate, Sun Chuan.

7433
05:20:08,390 --> 05:20:09,990
Kuzali, thank you for the super chat.

7434
05:20:10,110 --> 05:20:10,970
Thank you, thank you.

7435
05:20:19,010 --> 05:20:19,810
My Hoshi.

7436
05:20:41,050 --> 05:20:45,690
Tonight, we finally confront SaoSao in a battle that will decide our future!

7437
05:20:46,310 --> 05:20:48,070
We prepared as best we can.

7438
05:20:48,810 --> 05:20:53,090
All that's left is for us to believe in each other and fight through to the end.

7439
05:20:56,880 --> 05:20:59,360
I could be eating lasagna this entire time.

7440
05:20:59,540 --> 05:21:00,000
I'm sorry.

7441
05:21:00,200 --> 05:21:00,960
I'm sorry.

7442
05:21:01,700 --> 05:21:03,540
I'm still thinking about it.

7443
05:21:03,640 --> 05:21:04,180
We will win!

7444
05:21:09,510 --> 05:21:10,690
We're gonna do it!

7445
05:21:11,150 --> 05:21:12,470
Friendship is magic!

7446
05:21:16,070 --> 05:21:19,790
SaoSao's forces seem to have responded to their defeat by changing their formation.

7447
05:21:20,390 --> 05:21:26,410
They have linked their ships together into a solid platform, which will enable them to fight as if they are on land.

7448
05:21:26,690 --> 05:21:28,650
Oh, that's a foolish mistake!

7449
05:21:29,150 --> 05:21:32,370
I suppose such quick decision-making is to be expected from the ruler of the Central Plains.

7450
05:21:33,130 --> 05:21:36,930
But this time, those quick wits of his will be the cause of his downtime.

7451
05:21:36,930 --> 05:21:39,870
Yeah, it makes fire spread quickly if they're all linked.

7452
05:21:40,510 --> 05:21:44,370
Pong Tong's abilities have proven to be very impressive indeed.

7453
05:21:45,290 --> 05:21:50,410
For one so reluctant to join us, he has greatly exceeded expectations.

7454
05:21:53,070 --> 05:21:54,170
Okay guys, sorry.

7455
05:21:54,270 --> 05:21:54,930
I need a chair.

7456
05:21:56,830 --> 05:21:58,410
Okay, three more minutes.

7457
05:21:58,590 --> 05:22:01,070
Oh my god, it's gonna be right here!

7458
05:22:03,650 --> 05:22:04,570
My lasagna!

7459
05:22:08,430 --> 05:22:09,470
Don't tell me.

7460
05:22:09,910 --> 05:22:14,050
Lord Pong Tong was tasked with infiltrating the enemy ranks to offer a proposal to Cao Cao.

7461
05:22:14,650 --> 05:22:16,850
A plan to prevent his ships from rocking.

7462
05:22:17,010 --> 05:22:19,310
Oh, he was the one that gave him the plan.

7463
05:22:19,670 --> 05:22:23,570
The fire attack against a scattered fleet would give the flames no path to spread.

7464
05:22:23,650 --> 05:22:24,550
Oh, a double agent!

7465
05:22:24,570 --> 05:22:26,030
...trendering it largely ineffective.

7466
05:22:26,790 --> 05:22:34,470
Having their vessels clustered together and bound by chains will make the fire much more devastating.

7467
05:22:35,910 --> 05:22:42,790
In short, Lord Pong Tong's scheme is but the first step in our greater plan to defeat Cao Cao's army.

7468
05:22:43,230 --> 05:22:44,850
The chain stratagem.

7469
05:22:45,590 --> 05:22:51,370
Implemented by connecting several plans together in order to topple a powerful foe.

7470
05:22:53,670 --> 05:22:59,990
Still, we must keep in mind that a chain is only as strong as its weakest link.

7471
05:23:00,310 --> 05:23:04,930
And for that reason, we cannot abide even a single failure.

7472
05:23:04,930 --> 05:23:05,170
Yeah.

7473
05:23:05,950 --> 05:23:09,290
It's like a really complicated plan that somehow all just worked.

7474
05:23:11,050 --> 05:23:11,930
Cause like...

7475
05:23:11,930 --> 05:23:13,550
Like, he had to...

7476
05:23:13,550 --> 05:23:13,850
We all...

7477
05:23:13,850 --> 05:23:15,110
Like, everyone was like, oh, it's magic.

7478
05:23:15,290 --> 05:23:18,010
But like, Chu Got Lun looked into the sky and like...

7479
05:23:18,010 --> 05:23:21,670
Predicted when the wind was gonna change at that exact moment.

7480
05:23:22,090 --> 05:23:22,830
From just...

7481
05:23:22,830 --> 05:23:27,270
Like, you know, like how like sailors can predict like the weather and stuff from the sky and like...

7482
05:23:27,270 --> 05:23:28,930
Destinations and stuff like that.

7483
05:23:28,930 --> 05:23:30,590
And he could have escaped on his own.

7484
05:23:32,490 --> 05:23:36,930
No one knows where the enemy soldiers who surrendered in the last battle are either.

7485
05:23:37,490 --> 05:23:39,510
Yeah, he was like, a weatherman.

7486
05:23:39,970 --> 05:23:40,850
Something to do with it.

7487
05:23:42,130 --> 05:23:43,490
One guy a traitor?

7488
05:23:43,870 --> 05:23:45,750
It almost defies belief.

7489
05:23:48,910 --> 05:23:49,510
Oh?

7490
05:23:50,250 --> 05:23:53,610
Well, we haven't seen you around these parts in a while.

7491
05:23:54,250 --> 05:23:57,590
So, you've been at Lord Liu Bei's side, have you?

7492
05:24:00,330 --> 05:24:02,030
What's this about...

7493
05:24:02,030 --> 05:24:02,210
Hung...

7494
05:24:02,210 --> 05:24:05,010
Oh yeah, Hung Guy pretended to defect to...

7495
05:24:05,670 --> 05:24:06,190
Uh...

7496
05:24:06,190 --> 05:24:09,430
Defect to the other side, so he can set off like a...

7497
05:24:09,430 --> 05:24:11,930
Set off like bombs, like his own like firebomb.

7498
05:24:12,030 --> 05:24:13,230
We have turned traitor.

7499
05:24:14,410 --> 05:24:18,990
Not only has he been openly criticizing Lord Sun Chuen of late...

7500
05:24:18,990 --> 05:24:19,790
Oh, it's Chuen!

7501
05:24:20,110 --> 05:24:21,990
His actions have been consistently suspicious.

7502
05:24:23,050 --> 05:24:31,450
What's more, when Zhou Yu questioned him on his behavior, He carelessly spoke of having made contact with Cao Cao.

7503
05:24:31,970 --> 05:24:35,730
After that, he was flogged and thrown into the prison.

7504
05:24:37,350 --> 05:24:38,340
Yet, now...

7505
05:24:38,670 --> 05:24:41,050
Not a soul knows where he is.

7506
05:24:44,900 --> 05:24:46,940
I can hardly believe it.

7507
05:24:47,520 --> 05:24:51,060
Believe it or not, the fact remains that it happened.

7508
05:24:51,340 --> 05:24:55,190
I wish I had taken the opportunity to question him myself.

7509
05:24:56,350 --> 05:25:02,410
Regardless, if Huang Guy has defected to the enemy, Cao Cao may be aware of our plans.

7510
05:25:03,870 --> 05:25:07,850
We must proceed with the utmost caution in the next battle.

7511
05:25:11,010 --> 05:25:14,070
But yeah, Huang Guy defecting was part of his...

7512
05:25:14,070 --> 05:25:15,490
Zhukot Lun's entire plan.

7513
05:25:15,810 --> 05:25:16,610
It was so intricate.

7514
05:25:17,390 --> 05:25:18,030
That's why she...

7515
05:25:18,030 --> 05:25:21,050
The battle of Red Cliff is like one of the most like...

7516
05:25:21,690 --> 05:25:22,210
Um...

7517
05:25:22,210 --> 05:25:24,850
One of the most memorable fights...

7518
05:25:24,850 --> 05:25:27,510
Or like battles in the entire Three Kingdoms.

7519
05:25:27,690 --> 05:25:29,850
Because his plan was so...

7520
05:25:30,370 --> 05:25:30,890
Intricate...

7521
05:25:30,890 --> 05:25:32,130
And so...

7522
05:25:32,130 --> 05:25:32,750
Complicate...

7523
05:25:32,750 --> 05:25:34,090
It was so complicated...

7524
05:25:34,090 --> 05:25:35,910
And yet, everything worked.

7525
05:25:37,070 --> 05:25:39,370
Like, they were never supposed to win that fight.

7526
05:25:44,360 --> 05:25:44,860
Alright.

7527
05:25:46,640 --> 05:25:47,660
When's my food?

7528
05:25:48,420 --> 05:25:49,460
I swear to God.

7529
05:25:49,620 --> 05:25:50,500
If I see...

7530
05:25:50,500 --> 05:25:51,340
Okay, Derp.

7531
05:25:51,400 --> 05:25:53,440
He's gonna call me any second now.

7532
05:25:53,520 --> 05:25:54,100
Sorry, guys.

7533
05:25:54,340 --> 05:25:57,620
He's gonna call me any second now.

7534
05:25:57,820 --> 05:26:00,300
And then I'm gonna get my lasagna.

7535
05:26:01,040 --> 05:26:02,700
Alright, let's see what the letters are.

7536
05:26:02,900 --> 05:26:03,540
Oh, okay.

7537
05:26:03,980 --> 05:26:05,060
Wait, he still wants to...

7538
05:26:05,060 --> 05:26:06,300
We're still talking?

7539
05:26:10,820 --> 05:26:11,440
Okay.

7540
05:26:12,280 --> 05:26:14,000
I'd miss you a lot?

7541
05:26:15,240 --> 05:26:16,360
Oh my God.

7542
05:26:16,640 --> 05:26:18,300
If something were to happen to you...

7543
05:26:18,300 --> 05:26:18,760
I'd...

7544
05:26:18,760 --> 05:26:20,200
I'd miss you a lot.

7545
05:26:20,420 --> 05:26:20,980
Okay, buddy.

7546
05:26:21,400 --> 05:26:21,980
You...

7547
05:26:21,980 --> 05:26:23,760
This is a business relationship.

7548
05:26:26,540 --> 05:26:27,160
Okay.

7549
05:26:27,540 --> 05:26:29,300
I let you live here...

7550
05:26:29,990 --> 05:26:31,140
Without paying rent.

7551
05:26:31,560 --> 05:26:32,640
And that's it.

7552
05:26:32,920 --> 05:26:35,220
There's nothing happening between us, guys.

7553
05:26:35,220 --> 05:26:36,980
Famous officers and generals.

7554
05:26:37,120 --> 05:26:38,540
It's truly...

7555
05:26:38,540 --> 05:26:38,840
Lasagna.

7556
05:26:40,320 --> 05:26:41,080
Lasagna.

7557
05:26:41,480 --> 05:26:42,260
Oh my God.

7558
05:26:42,560 --> 05:26:44,120
After all those cut scenes.

7559
05:26:44,620 --> 05:26:46,960
I don't get my lasagna.

7560
05:26:48,360 --> 05:26:48,800
No!

7561
05:26:53,900 --> 05:26:56,540
I go straight to bat...

7562
05:26:59,860 --> 05:27:00,540
Wait!

7563
05:27:00,620 --> 05:27:02,240
There was another cut scene!

7564
05:27:02,620 --> 05:27:03,440
Oh my God.

7565
05:27:03,960 --> 05:27:05,780
We must realize the long song plan.

7566
05:27:06,000 --> 05:27:08,760
I could have ate my food while we watched this.

7567
05:27:09,280 --> 05:27:11,260
We must first win this battle.

7568
05:27:11,260 --> 05:27:13,300
I didn't think there was another one.

7569
05:27:14,340 --> 05:27:15,520
I'll say it again.

7570
05:27:16,560 --> 05:27:20,040
But this mission relies on the outcome of the fire attack.

7571
05:27:21,040 --> 05:27:21,600
Call me!

7572
05:27:22,060 --> 05:27:23,140
As such...

7573
05:27:23,140 --> 05:27:25,920
We will give the command to go into battle.

7574
05:27:26,140 --> 05:27:28,780
The moment you sense a change in the wind.

7575
05:27:30,400 --> 05:27:33,160
Has the wind shown any sign of changing soon?

7576
05:27:33,300 --> 05:27:33,600
Oh my God.

7577
05:27:33,600 --> 05:27:33,700
Oh my God.

7578
05:27:33,800 --> 05:27:34,560
It should arrive soon.

7579
05:27:35,160 --> 05:27:35,640
Oh my God.

7580
05:27:35,820 --> 05:27:36,280
They called.

7581
05:27:36,480 --> 05:27:37,660
It should arrive soon.

7582
05:27:37,660 --> 05:27:37,820
Understood.

7583
05:27:38,740 --> 05:27:41,020
Then we shall mobilize our troops at once.

7584
05:27:43,340 --> 05:27:43,780
Okay.

7585
05:27:44,220 --> 05:27:45,560
We just gotta make sure...

7586
05:27:45,560 --> 05:27:45,920
He...

7587
05:27:45,920 --> 05:27:47,620
We give him the right signal.

7588
05:27:47,880 --> 05:27:49,640
I didn't listen to what the right signal was.

7589
05:27:49,760 --> 05:27:50,260
But I'm ready.

7590
05:27:52,740 --> 05:27:53,420
Let's begin.

7591
05:27:55,080 --> 05:27:56,840
Tata's forces have been deployed to Chi B.

7592
05:27:57,000 --> 05:27:57,700
Just as we planned.

7593
05:27:57,840 --> 05:27:58,820
Now begin our real battle.

7594
05:27:59,000 --> 05:28:00,440
Please, everyone listen closely.

7595
05:28:01,220 --> 05:28:03,620
The enemy currently has a massive fleet on the river.

7596
05:28:03,820 --> 05:28:06,640
In terms of numbers alone, our alliances does not stand a chance.

7597
05:28:06,640 --> 05:28:09,580
However, Lord Zhukot Lan and I have a plan to win.

7598
05:28:09,820 --> 05:28:11,920
We will use fire to send the enemy running.

7599
05:28:12,160 --> 05:28:13,680
And put an end to Tao Tao's ambition.

7600
05:28:14,240 --> 05:28:16,440
We are in lines of Wu and Lord Lu Bei's forces.

7601
05:28:16,780 --> 05:28:20,880
This means both Lord Sun Qian and Lord Lu Bei must be protected.

7602
05:28:21,760 --> 05:28:22,160
Okay.

7603
05:28:22,440 --> 05:28:24,980
And to spare a thought for Lord Zhou Yu and myself.

7604
05:28:25,200 --> 05:28:27,080
As this battle cannot be won without our strategy.

7605
05:28:27,780 --> 05:28:30,640
The key to our fire attack is the direction of the wind.

7606
05:28:30,920 --> 05:28:33,820
We must wait until the northern wind turns towards south east.

7607
05:28:34,520 --> 05:28:37,960
As this battle begins, the enemy assault will be fierce and unyielding.

7608
05:28:38,620 --> 05:28:41,180
But this plan will not work unless you can stop to advance.

7609
05:28:41,680 --> 05:28:42,380
Hold your ground.

7610
05:28:43,240 --> 05:28:45,140
To encounter that traitor among them.

7611
05:28:45,540 --> 05:28:46,260
Do not hesitate.

7612
05:28:46,740 --> 05:28:49,480
Consider it an opportunity to remedy that concern.

7613
05:28:50,300 --> 05:28:52,980
Meanwhile, I will pray for the winds to change.

7614
05:28:53,200 --> 05:28:55,900
I will ask for someone to guard me as I perform the prayer.

7615
05:28:55,900 --> 05:28:56,020
No.

7616
05:28:56,640 --> 05:28:57,160
Hmm.

7617
05:28:57,480 --> 05:28:59,140
Turning to prayers like this for success?

7618
05:28:59,340 --> 05:29:00,580
Seems unlike you.

7619
05:29:00,980 --> 05:29:03,000
There must be some greater reason for this, no?

7620
05:29:03,420 --> 05:29:03,800
Yes.

7621
05:29:04,160 --> 05:29:05,900
This is very assumed of you, Lord Lu Su.

7622
05:29:06,180 --> 05:29:09,040
The reasons for this ruse are two-fold.

7623
05:29:09,620 --> 05:29:11,580
First, is to serve as a decoy.

7624
05:29:11,860 --> 05:29:18,600
When the enemy sees the sleeping dragon acting in such an unexpected way on the field, it will draw their attention.

7625
05:29:20,680 --> 05:29:22,220
This must be con- Oh!

7626
05:29:22,500 --> 05:29:22,820
Food!

7627
05:29:22,820 --> 05:29:22,900
Food!

7628
05:29:22,900 --> 05:29:23,800
I'll be right back.

7629
05:29:42,710 --> 05:29:43,430
Fia!

7630
05:29:43,870 --> 05:29:44,590
Food!

7631
05:29:45,290 --> 05:29:45,910
Lasagna!

7632
05:29:47,990 --> 05:29:48,710
Finally!

7633
05:29:49,710 --> 05:29:52,500
This is what I...

7634
05:29:53,000 --> 05:29:55,200
This entire time...

7635
05:29:56,580 --> 05:29:57,400
This is really...

7636
05:29:58,480 --> 05:29:58,520
What?

7637
05:29:59,340 --> 05:30:01,860
And I didn't even give via a fork.

7638
05:30:02,440 --> 05:30:02,760
Okay.

7639
05:30:21,670 --> 05:30:25,710
After all my struggles, I don't even get a fork.

7640
05:30:25,710 --> 05:30:26,590
I...

7641
05:30:28,990 --> 05:30:29,470
I...

7642
05:30:30,090 --> 05:30:30,570
I...

7643
05:30:30,570 --> 05:30:30,610
I...

7644
05:30:30,610 --> 05:30:32,770
I don't even get a fucking fork after...

7645
05:30:33,770 --> 05:30:35,790
After everything I've been through.

7646
05:30:36,430 --> 05:30:36,910
I...

7647
05:30:36,910 --> 05:30:38,050
This is...

7648
05:30:39,150 --> 05:30:40,150
That's so fucked up.

7649
05:30:40,230 --> 05:30:42,130
I'm gonna eat a little bit of my caprese salad, though.

7650
05:30:42,430 --> 05:30:45,230
I know I should eat my actual lasagna, but I love caprese salad.

7651
05:30:47,470 --> 05:30:49,510
I love caprese cheese.

7652
05:30:50,290 --> 05:30:52,570
I just want my cheese!

7653
05:30:54,270 --> 05:30:55,330
Mmm...

7654
05:30:58,720 --> 05:31:00,020
It's good.

7655
05:31:01,820 --> 05:31:04,140
I love caprese salad.

7656
05:31:07,710 --> 05:31:08,370
It's good.

7657
05:31:08,450 --> 05:31:09,690
Alright, mozzarella...

7658
05:31:11,030 --> 05:31:12,250
With the tomato.

7659
05:31:13,110 --> 05:31:14,190
It's so good.

7660
05:31:14,390 --> 05:31:16,270
Mozzarella with the...

7661
05:31:16,270 --> 05:31:18,510
I was thinking of burrata cheese, for some reason.

7662
05:31:18,750 --> 05:31:19,190
I forgot.

7663
05:31:19,570 --> 05:31:19,970
It's...

7664
05:31:19,970 --> 05:31:21,790
I love the mozzarella with the tomato.

7665
05:31:22,210 --> 05:31:23,050
So good.

7666
05:31:23,890 --> 05:31:25,750
And then the sauce on top of it.

7667
05:31:25,970 --> 05:31:26,030
Mmm.

7668
05:31:26,770 --> 05:31:27,690
Yum, yum, yum, yum.

7669
05:31:27,930 --> 05:31:29,470
The vinegar and pesto sauce.

7670
05:31:29,730 --> 05:31:31,190
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

7671
05:31:32,630 --> 05:31:35,070
Okay, let me...

7672
05:31:38,450 --> 05:31:39,670
Mmm.

7673
05:31:45,110 --> 05:31:46,870
Now it's lasagna time!

7674
05:31:48,270 --> 05:31:48,790
Sorry.

7675
05:31:49,030 --> 05:31:50,230
Small food ASMR.

7676
05:31:50,650 --> 05:31:51,090
Real quick.

7677
05:31:52,410 --> 05:31:53,370
Lasagna time!

7678
05:31:53,370 --> 05:31:53,630
Time!

7679
05:31:54,570 --> 05:31:55,790
I was hungry.

7680
05:31:55,930 --> 05:31:56,730
I was really hungry.

7681
05:31:56,910 --> 05:31:57,310
I'm sorry.

7682
05:32:00,910 --> 05:32:04,390
I kept thinking about this lasagna for so long.

7683
05:32:08,840 --> 05:32:10,100
Oh my god.

7684
05:32:10,480 --> 05:32:11,580
It's so good.

7685
05:32:13,080 --> 05:32:14,480
Oh my god!

7686
05:32:17,840 --> 05:32:19,660
Oh no!

7687
05:32:20,520 --> 05:32:21,920
It's so good!

7688
05:32:27,190 --> 05:32:28,450
That was worth waiting.

7689
05:32:28,870 --> 05:32:32,610
I wish I had my million of cutscenes to watch while I eat.

7690
05:32:41,160 --> 05:32:45,140
If I could, I'd make you guys watch Ink Masters with me while I eat.

7691
05:32:45,840 --> 05:32:47,280
But I can't do that on YouTube.

7692
05:32:51,940 --> 05:32:52,640
I would.

7693
05:32:52,860 --> 05:32:54,020
If I could, I would.

7694
05:32:54,160 --> 05:32:55,360
But I can't do that on YouTube.

7695
05:32:59,480 --> 05:33:01,180
I'll just take a couple more bites.

7696
05:33:01,460 --> 05:33:02,080
And then we'll play.

7697
05:33:03,000 --> 05:33:05,200
Just let me enjoy a couple more bites.

7698
05:33:10,960 --> 05:33:12,840
And then we'll... We'll keep playing.

7699
05:33:14,020 --> 05:33:16,460
Because I didn't... I promise you guys, we will finish.

7700
05:33:16,460 --> 05:33:17,480
We're so close.

7701
05:33:17,840 --> 05:33:19,860
We literally have two more battles.

7702
05:33:27,220 --> 05:33:30,260
In this moment, lasagna or chukotlan?

7703
05:33:31,660 --> 05:33:32,300
Ooh.

7704
05:33:32,300 --> 05:33:33,380
I'm hungry.

7705
05:33:40,700 --> 05:33:43,140
The thing is, I'm really hungry.

7706
05:33:45,320 --> 05:33:46,740
I don't know.

7707
05:33:50,000 --> 05:33:51,240
Why not both?

7708
05:33:51,960 --> 05:33:52,880
Yummy, yummy.

7709
05:34:03,930 --> 05:34:04,530
Okay.

7710
05:34:05,990 --> 05:34:06,850
I'm ready.

7711
05:34:08,130 --> 05:34:08,990
Wait, JK.

7712
05:34:08,990 --> 05:34:09,930
Let me take one more bite.

7713
05:34:10,610 --> 05:34:12,330
I'm pretty sure the driver ate my...

7714
05:34:12,330 --> 05:34:13,850
The first driver ate my food.

7715
05:34:14,010 --> 05:34:14,610
There's no way.

7716
05:34:18,400 --> 05:34:21,740
There's no way the restaurant cancelled the first order.

7717
05:34:21,740 --> 05:34:23,740
And then reordered the same fucking thing.

7718
05:34:23,900 --> 05:34:24,880
And then it got to me.

7719
05:34:29,730 --> 05:34:30,650
I had lunch.

7720
05:34:30,730 --> 05:34:31,570
But I had like...

7721
05:34:31,570 --> 05:34:33,910
I had a breakfast wrap.

7722
05:34:34,290 --> 05:34:35,350
So it wasn't like a lot.

7723
05:34:48,100 --> 05:34:48,900
Okay, I'm good.

7724
05:34:49,180 --> 05:34:50,060
I'm good to go.

7725
05:34:53,060 --> 05:34:54,040
I'm good to go.

7726
05:34:55,060 --> 05:34:55,760
All right.

7727
05:34:57,660 --> 05:35:02,280
They're surely concerned that we are up to something nefarious and will send soldiers to hinder me.

7728
05:35:04,320 --> 05:35:07,700
Secondly, it allows me to send a signal when the fires are to be lit.

7729
05:35:08,080 --> 05:35:12,500
The prairie area is on high ground and offers a view of the whole battlefield.

7730
05:35:13,140 --> 05:35:14,960
Once the altar is ablaze...

7731
05:35:14,960 --> 05:35:16,240
Oh, I looked...

7732
05:35:16,240 --> 05:35:17,140
I accidentally pressed it.

7733
05:35:17,140 --> 05:35:20,420
And that will tell the hidden troops it's time to launch the fire attack.

7734
05:35:21,320 --> 05:35:24,420
As for figuring out the exact timing, that will be your job.

7735
05:35:25,200 --> 05:35:26,900
You are to read the winds.

7736
05:35:27,220 --> 05:35:31,180
When the time is right, launch a fire arrow above the battlefield.

7737
05:35:32,300 --> 05:35:33,320
It will be...

7738
05:35:33,320 --> 05:35:33,700
How?

7739
05:35:33,980 --> 05:35:35,140
How would I know?

7740
05:35:39,630 --> 05:35:41,150
But how would I know?

7741
05:35:57,150 --> 05:36:05,170
How would I know when the wind changes?

7742
05:36:05,990 --> 05:36:08,390
You have to use my special eyes all the time?

7743
05:36:09,310 --> 05:36:10,390
I'm scared.

7744
05:36:11,210 --> 05:36:12,570
That's so much responsibility.

7745
05:36:15,650 --> 05:36:16,850
I'm scared.

7746
05:36:18,590 --> 05:36:20,510
That's so much responsibility.

7747
05:36:23,630 --> 05:36:25,890
It's the wind blowing north right...

7748
05:36:25,890 --> 05:36:26,530
Where is...

7749
05:36:26,530 --> 05:36:28,090
I don't know.

7750
05:36:28,890 --> 05:36:30,370
Okay, it's this way.

7751
05:36:30,850 --> 05:36:32,730
The wind is that way right now.

7752
05:36:32,830 --> 05:36:34,470
Okay, it's blowing towards me.

7753
05:36:35,230 --> 05:36:37,230
Okay, you'll know when you know.

7754
05:36:37,370 --> 05:36:38,010
Okay, I believe.

7755
05:36:40,390 --> 05:36:41,550
I'll take command of this battle.

7756
05:36:43,450 --> 05:36:45,250
All right, we'll go forward.

7757
05:36:48,010 --> 05:36:48,670
Don't worry.

7758
05:36:48,790 --> 05:36:49,870
When I know, I'll know.

7759
05:36:51,050 --> 05:36:54,050
All of my plans depend on this decisive battle.

7760
05:36:54,950 --> 05:36:57,770
Each and every one of you must carry out your duties.

7761
05:36:58,070 --> 05:37:00,770
So that we may claim a crushing victory.

7762
05:37:02,490 --> 05:37:03,510
All right, I'm ready.

7763
05:37:03,510 --> 05:37:06,370
We should send ships from our flanks to attack the enemy.

7764
05:37:06,770 --> 05:37:11,110
If the time is right, we shall cut our way into their base from the front.

7765
05:37:11,350 --> 05:37:12,190
Oh, wait, look at that.

7766
05:37:12,190 --> 05:37:12,990
It's coming over.

7767
05:37:13,270 --> 05:37:13,870
You see those ships?

7768
05:37:14,010 --> 05:37:15,690
Oh my god, it's like a little taxi.

7769
05:37:16,730 --> 05:37:17,350
Beep, beep.

7770
05:37:17,350 --> 05:37:20,890
All units, strengthen your guard.

7771
05:37:21,750 --> 05:37:22,630
That's right.

7772
05:37:22,930 --> 05:37:23,710
That's right.

7773
05:37:23,710 --> 05:37:26,190
As long as we hold firm.

7774
05:37:26,730 --> 05:37:28,650
Put your ship, connect your ship to ours.

7775
05:37:29,350 --> 05:37:30,190
That's right.

7776
05:37:30,650 --> 05:37:31,650
I dare you.

7777
05:37:31,990 --> 05:37:32,690
Stay on the defensive.

7778
05:37:33,090 --> 05:37:34,050
You think I'm scared?

7779
05:37:36,150 --> 05:37:37,610
I have no fear.

7780
05:37:41,410 --> 05:37:42,690
Read the winds.

7781
05:37:46,770 --> 05:37:48,070
Okay, it's that way now.

7782
05:37:48,250 --> 05:37:48,450
Okay.

7783
05:37:49,210 --> 05:37:50,590
Okay, it's that way now.

7784
05:37:53,650 --> 05:37:54,170
All right.

7785
05:37:55,130 --> 05:37:56,790
Guys, I might need you guys to yell at me.

7786
05:37:56,990 --> 05:37:59,450
Because I will most likely fuck it up.

7787
05:38:01,430 --> 05:38:02,810
I'll let you guys know.

7788
05:38:03,190 --> 05:38:05,210
I will most likely fuck it up.

7789
05:38:05,310 --> 05:38:07,210
I need you guys to let me know when it's here.

7790
05:38:07,790 --> 05:38:09,150
I don't believe in myself.

7791
05:38:12,690 --> 05:38:13,350
Okay, nice.

7792
05:38:14,950 --> 05:38:15,970
All right, nice.

7793
05:38:17,070 --> 05:38:17,790
All right.

7794
05:38:20,550 --> 05:38:21,510
Wait, what?

7795
05:38:21,790 --> 05:38:22,410
Did I not...

7796
05:38:23,550 --> 05:38:23,890
Okay.

7797
05:38:26,410 --> 05:38:28,270
Oh my god, I can't do anything!

7798
05:38:29,110 --> 05:38:31,470
Oh my god, they all like...

7799
05:38:32,830 --> 05:38:34,230
They all attacked me.

7800
05:38:34,330 --> 05:38:35,470
I literally couldn't do anything.

7801
05:38:38,370 --> 05:38:40,450
Like, what do I do?

7802
05:38:42,690 --> 05:38:43,570
Push on through!

7803
05:38:44,050 --> 05:38:44,930
I see it!

7804
05:38:46,550 --> 05:38:47,090
Jesus.

7805
05:38:50,690 --> 05:38:52,530
Oh my god, I already had two bugs left.

7806
05:38:53,270 --> 05:38:55,550
The enemy officer has been defeated.

7807
05:38:57,630 --> 05:38:58,450
Okay, I got another one.

7808
05:38:58,730 --> 05:38:59,510
That's good.

7809
05:39:00,590 --> 05:39:02,930
The enemy officer has been defeated.

7810
05:39:03,350 --> 05:39:03,530
How?

7811
05:39:03,970 --> 05:39:04,430
How?

7812
05:39:05,510 --> 05:39:06,050
HONDE!

7813
05:39:06,210 --> 05:39:06,430
I...

7814
05:39:06,430 --> 05:39:08,010
Oh my god, HONDE, you're useless.

7815
05:39:08,370 --> 05:39:09,650
You're actually useless.

7816
05:39:10,570 --> 05:39:13,130
I'm still, like, fighting 200 people!

7817
05:39:13,890 --> 05:39:16,350
I should fall back while I can.

7818
05:39:17,810 --> 05:39:19,750
Everything is going well so far.

7819
05:39:20,290 --> 05:39:22,990
I'd say it's just about time to land another blow.

7820
05:39:23,830 --> 05:39:25,750
Oh my god, I've been stuck here!

7821
05:39:27,870 --> 05:39:30,070
This is why people forget about you.

7822
05:39:30,450 --> 05:39:33,170
This just became a lot more complicated.

7823
05:39:33,730 --> 05:39:34,210
Okay, nice.

7824
05:39:37,910 --> 05:39:39,410
Oh my god, we're about to kill him.

7825
05:39:41,990 --> 05:39:42,690
Okay, nice.

7826
05:39:47,990 --> 05:39:49,130
Okay, we gotta go back.

7827
05:39:51,850 --> 05:39:54,390
Okay, we gotta go back and help the rest of the team.

7828
05:39:57,790 --> 05:39:58,370
Wait, what?

7829
05:39:58,370 --> 05:40:00,490
Maintain a constant barrage of arrows.

7830
05:40:01,130 --> 05:40:02,210
No, I killed him.

7831
05:40:04,370 --> 05:40:05,230
Wait, what?

7832
05:40:05,490 --> 05:40:06,150
When did he show up?

7833
05:40:07,430 --> 05:40:08,990
But I thought I killed you!

7834
05:40:12,490 --> 05:40:13,930
Oh, no, I can't.

7835
05:40:14,050 --> 05:40:15,150
How many...

7836
05:40:15,150 --> 05:40:17,270
But there's too many people!

7837
05:40:17,270 --> 05:40:18,350
We're gonna make it through this.

7838
05:40:24,030 --> 05:40:25,610
I can't do anything!

7839
05:40:35,830 --> 05:40:37,750
No, it's fine, I can kill him.

7840
05:40:38,250 --> 05:40:40,050
It's fine, Chugolay would live!

7841
05:40:40,270 --> 05:40:40,990
Trust me!

7842
05:40:41,270 --> 05:40:43,850
As long as he lives, he is short of the authority on my side.

7843
05:40:43,870 --> 05:40:44,870
I can, I can do this!

7844
05:40:45,510 --> 05:40:46,430
March forward!

7845
05:40:46,610 --> 05:40:48,110
Don't worry, it'll be fine!

7846
05:40:48,290 --> 05:40:49,170
It'll be fine!

7847
05:40:49,630 --> 05:40:52,850
As expected, you have bared your fangs at me.

7848
05:40:53,630 --> 05:40:55,510
This is in line with my prediction.

7849
05:40:56,990 --> 05:40:57,550
Trust!

7850
05:40:57,550 --> 05:40:57,650
Trust!

7851
05:40:57,650 --> 05:40:59,230
You have my mind getting cornered!

7852
05:40:59,890 --> 05:41:00,450
Seriously?

7853
05:41:01,990 --> 05:41:02,550
Really?

7854
05:41:02,790 --> 05:41:03,550
What just happened?

7855
05:41:03,750 --> 05:41:04,110
Oh my god!

7856
05:41:05,650 --> 05:41:06,450
With all my might!

7857
05:41:06,450 --> 05:41:06,590
With all my might!

7858
05:41:08,030 --> 05:41:08,110
I!

7859
05:41:08,330 --> 05:41:10,250
What just happened?

7860
05:41:11,370 --> 05:41:11,450
Oh damnit!

7861
05:41:11,690 --> 05:41:12,710
Fine, it's fine, it's fine.

7862
05:41:13,570 --> 05:41:13,750
So...

7863
05:41:13,750 --> 05:41:14,230
I...

7864
05:41:14,230 --> 05:41:14,630
Nice!

7865
05:41:15,410 --> 05:41:16,190
I believe!

7866
05:41:16,570 --> 05:41:18,130
I can live!

7867
05:41:19,210 --> 05:41:19,590
Really?

7868
05:41:20,470 --> 05:41:22,370
I'm of no use to anybody dead.

7869
05:41:22,370 --> 05:41:23,370
It's fine!

7870
05:41:23,790 --> 05:41:24,350
It's fine!

7871
05:41:25,170 --> 05:41:26,310
He's almost dead!

7872
05:41:26,490 --> 05:41:26,830
It's fine!

7873
05:41:27,050 --> 05:41:28,110
No matter how you slice it!

7874
05:41:28,890 --> 05:41:29,690
I'll protect him soon!

7875
05:41:29,690 --> 05:41:30,450
Don't worry!

7876
05:41:31,050 --> 05:41:31,150
Okay!

7877
05:41:31,430 --> 05:41:32,290
Let's end this!

7878
05:41:33,070 --> 05:41:33,590
Ahhhh!

7879
05:41:33,750 --> 05:41:35,410
He's just staring for him!

7880
05:41:35,730 --> 05:41:36,870
But it's too late!

7881
05:41:37,410 --> 05:41:37,790
Okay!

7882
05:41:38,110 --> 05:41:38,790
I'm coming back!

7883
05:41:38,910 --> 05:41:39,410
I'm coming back!

7884
05:41:40,010 --> 05:41:40,590
I'm coming back!

7885
05:41:40,710 --> 05:41:41,130
I'm coming back!

7886
05:41:41,290 --> 05:41:41,570
Don't worry!

7887
05:41:42,270 --> 05:41:42,590
I'm coming!

7888
05:41:42,790 --> 05:41:43,670
Where did I go wrong?

7889
05:41:44,610 --> 05:41:45,710
Okay the wins is up!

7890
05:41:46,250 --> 05:41:46,790
Don't worry!

7891
05:41:46,910 --> 05:41:47,890
Don't worry!

7892
05:41:48,070 --> 05:41:49,130
I will...

7893
05:41:49,130 --> 05:41:50,910
begin the prayer!

7894
05:41:50,910 --> 05:41:51,990
Wait, wait, wait.

7895
05:41:52,190 --> 05:41:53,370
Don't forget to pray in.

7896
05:41:53,530 --> 05:41:56,230
While carrying out the most vital part of the plan.

7897
05:41:56,550 --> 05:41:57,110
Wait, wait, wait.

7898
05:41:57,130 --> 05:41:57,590
I'm coming over.

7899
05:41:57,590 --> 05:41:58,090
I'm coming over.

7900
05:41:58,230 --> 05:41:58,790
I know this will be hard.

7901
05:42:00,730 --> 05:42:02,650
But... I am counting on you all.

7902
05:42:02,710 --> 05:42:03,170
Don't worry.

7903
05:42:03,250 --> 05:42:03,490
I'm here.

7904
05:42:03,590 --> 05:42:04,030
I'm here.

7905
05:42:04,710 --> 05:42:05,130
I'm here.

7906
05:42:05,150 --> 05:42:05,190
I'm here.

7907
05:42:05,210 --> 05:42:05,490
I'm here.

7908
05:42:05,990 --> 05:42:06,390
I'm here.

7909
05:42:06,830 --> 05:42:07,630
This is weird.

7910
05:42:07,770 --> 05:42:07,990
It's fine.

7911
05:42:10,510 --> 05:42:10,870
Hey.

7912
05:42:15,590 --> 05:42:19,010
Wait, where's the... Wait, I thought he was gonna do the musu attack.

7913
05:42:19,010 --> 05:42:21,570
Pass the attack and take victory for ourselves.

7914
05:42:22,130 --> 05:42:23,310
Advance the fleet.

7915
05:42:23,470 --> 05:42:26,350
With these ships, who is ours for the taking?

7916
05:42:27,530 --> 05:42:28,790
Okay, I got the musu.

7917
05:42:35,390 --> 05:42:36,790
So they've arrived.

7918
05:42:37,430 --> 05:42:39,690
Still, it's not yet time.

7919
05:42:40,090 --> 05:42:42,390
You have to endure their assault for now.

7920
05:42:43,310 --> 05:42:45,330
We've lost our archers in the east.

7921
05:42:45,650 --> 05:42:46,530
Oh, duh.

7922
05:42:46,810 --> 05:42:49,270
The enemy's offensive will go on unimpeded now.

7923
05:42:50,490 --> 05:42:51,090
Wait.

7924
05:42:51,450 --> 05:42:52,170
Wait.

7925
05:42:52,650 --> 05:42:53,370
Wait.

7926
05:42:53,370 --> 05:42:55,310
Oh yeah.

7927
05:42:55,310 --> 05:42:56,710
Wait guys, this is a little difficult.

7928
05:43:00,030 --> 05:43:03,350
I can do it left and right?

7929
05:43:03,910 --> 05:43:03,930
Wait.

7930
05:43:03,930 --> 05:43:05,050
With all my might death.

7931
05:43:05,430 --> 05:43:07,010
I keep learning.

7932
05:43:09,670 --> 05:43:10,390
I'm on well.

7933
05:43:13,930 --> 05:43:15,830
You're on the spot.

7934
05:43:15,830 --> 05:43:16,110
What one guy.

7935
05:43:18,610 --> 05:43:20,990
Like, he just said he's running away!

7936
05:43:21,850 --> 05:43:23,650
Oh my god, Stu and Shan-chan.

7937
05:43:24,170 --> 05:43:33,090
The enemy officer has been defeated, and the enemies advancing on our position have been eliminated.

7938
05:43:33,570 --> 05:43:34,070
Okay.

7939
05:43:34,270 --> 05:43:37,950
I think it's safe to say that our distraction was a success.

7940
05:43:38,410 --> 05:43:39,130
Okay.

7941
05:43:39,490 --> 05:43:40,370
That's fine.

7942
05:43:40,370 --> 05:43:42,910
To aid our allies on the other fronts.

7943
05:43:43,250 --> 05:43:43,770
Alright.

7944
05:43:44,310 --> 05:43:46,910
The enemy officer has been defeated.

7945
05:43:47,230 --> 05:43:48,190
Annihilate the enemy.

7946
05:43:48,350 --> 05:43:48,530
Okay.

7947
05:43:48,530 --> 05:43:49,110
I'm coming over.

7948
05:43:49,210 --> 05:43:49,670
I'm coming over.

7949
05:43:49,690 --> 05:43:50,230
I'm coming over.

7950
05:43:50,230 --> 05:43:51,470
I'm coming over.

7951
05:43:51,650 --> 05:43:52,150
I'm coming over.

7952
05:43:52,150 --> 05:43:57,730
Now this is what I call intense.

7953
05:43:58,230 --> 05:43:59,190
I'm coming over.

7954
05:43:59,390 --> 05:43:59,910
I'm coming over.

7955
05:44:00,050 --> 05:44:00,610
I'm coming over.

7956
05:44:00,690 --> 05:44:03,690
I'm fucking riding my horse as fast as I can!

7957
05:44:05,370 --> 05:44:07,890
So I shall show you no mercy.

7958
05:44:07,890 --> 05:44:10,490
Get out of my sight if you wish to live.

7959
05:44:10,810 --> 05:44:11,430
Oh my god.

7960
05:44:11,450 --> 05:44:13,770
Oh my god.

7961
05:44:14,670 --> 05:44:15,110
Oh my god.

7962
05:44:15,330 --> 05:44:16,430
Oh I'm gonna go back.

7963
05:44:16,630 --> 05:44:17,470
I'm going back.

7964
05:44:19,690 --> 05:44:22,310
I'm going back.

7965
05:44:23,750 --> 05:44:26,230
I lacked the foresight to predict his betrayal.

7966
05:44:27,050 --> 05:44:30,450
I shall take responsibility for this failure and stop him here.

7967
05:44:34,430 --> 05:44:36,190
I don't know where Hongai is.

7968
05:44:36,350 --> 05:44:37,450
I don't know.

7969
05:44:39,010 --> 05:44:41,250
Our eastern front is being overwhelmed.

7970
05:44:41,750 --> 05:44:44,790
We should send the rear guard to bolster our defenses there.

7971
05:44:45,770 --> 05:44:47,630
There's a lot of stuff happening.

7972
05:44:50,250 --> 05:44:50,770
Please.

7973
05:44:51,910 --> 05:44:54,510
You can't just tell me to go there and then...

7974
05:44:54,510 --> 05:44:56,970
Please, I have to deal with so much.

7975
05:44:56,970 --> 05:45:01,550
I assure you, at this point, there is nothing left to say.

7976
05:45:02,670 --> 05:45:05,470
Indeed, our blades shall do the talking.

7977
05:45:10,010 --> 05:45:11,570
Oh my god.

7978
05:45:12,870 --> 05:45:14,210
Wait, this is bad.

7979
05:45:15,470 --> 05:45:16,450
Are you ready to face me?

7980
05:45:20,290 --> 05:45:21,750
Almost at all limits.

7981
05:45:21,750 --> 05:45:22,530
Oh my god!

7982
05:45:22,810 --> 05:45:23,630
Oh no!

7983
05:45:23,990 --> 05:45:24,570
Oh my god!

7984
05:45:26,970 --> 05:45:28,030
I believe.

7985
05:45:28,770 --> 05:45:29,870
I believe.

7986
05:45:30,310 --> 05:45:31,170
I believe.

7987
05:45:32,650 --> 05:45:33,590
I believe.

7988
05:45:33,590 --> 05:45:33,650
I believe.

7989
05:45:34,070 --> 05:45:36,490
I claim another victory in the name of our brother.

7990
05:45:36,510 --> 05:45:38,250
What do you mean you claimed it?

7991
05:45:38,270 --> 05:45:39,630
The enemy has breached the altar room.

7992
05:45:40,530 --> 05:45:42,630
Please, eliminate them at once.

7993
05:45:42,930 --> 05:45:43,450
Oh my god!

7994
05:45:43,570 --> 05:45:44,390
I have to do so much!

7995
05:45:47,150 --> 05:45:48,010
I'm one!

7996
05:45:48,570 --> 05:45:49,150
I'm one!

7997
05:45:49,150 --> 05:45:49,310
I'm one!

7998
05:45:52,890 --> 05:45:54,150
Time to end this!

7999
05:45:54,270 --> 05:45:55,070
Oh my god.

8000
05:45:55,450 --> 05:45:56,250
Oh my god!

8001
05:45:56,450 --> 05:45:58,650
What doing, what, what, what!

8002
05:45:58,650 --> 05:45:59,950
What, what, what?

8003
05:46:00,550 --> 05:46:00,550
What!

8004
05:46:01,050 --> 05:46:01,490
What...

8005
05:46:01,490 --> 05:46:02,890
I'm coming back, I'm coming back!

8006
05:46:02,890 --> 05:46:06,050
Please, just leave them, please.

8007
05:46:08,030 --> 05:46:09,410
Where, where, where, where?

8008
05:46:09,670 --> 05:46:11,290
Oh my god!

8009
05:46:11,530 --> 05:46:19,850
Oh my god, how do I... How do I win this?

8010
05:46:23,230 --> 05:46:25,050
Oh my god, wait!

8011
05:46:25,670 --> 05:46:27,930
Wait, wait, I went the wrong way!

8012
05:46:30,710 --> 05:46:32,770
Get out, get out, get out, get out!

8013
05:46:32,890 --> 05:46:35,470
Have you sensed any changes in the winds yet?

8014
05:46:36,030 --> 05:46:36,710
No!

8015
05:46:37,330 --> 05:46:40,910
If you sense a change while nearby, you needn't inform me.

8016
05:46:41,790 --> 05:46:45,830
Simply light the fire on the altar yourself.

8017
05:46:46,530 --> 05:46:49,810
The road ahead is thorny, but walk it we shall.

8018
05:46:50,630 --> 05:46:52,390
Oh my god, oh my god.

8019
05:46:52,570 --> 05:46:54,310
Lupin, nooooo!

8020
05:46:54,830 --> 05:46:55,770
No way.

8021
05:46:56,330 --> 05:46:57,710
I'm gonna lose?

8022
05:46:58,530 --> 05:46:59,790
I can't tell!

8023
05:47:00,470 --> 05:47:02,870
But south-south forces still have the edge.

8024
05:47:03,570 --> 05:47:05,630
It's like... Did the wind change?

8025
05:47:05,870 --> 05:47:06,830
I can't tell!

8026
05:47:09,270 --> 05:47:10,970
I challenge you to battle.

8027
05:47:11,170 --> 05:47:11,370
Here we go.

8028
05:47:11,870 --> 05:47:12,910
Got to spare yourself.

8029
05:47:14,210 --> 05:47:15,150
My dream... No!

8030
05:47:15,630 --> 05:47:16,550
He's dead!

8031
05:47:21,310 --> 05:47:28,880
I just... I just... I just made it to the altar!

8032
05:47:31,000 --> 05:47:32,720
Holy shit!

8033
05:47:33,700 --> 05:47:34,380
Okay.

8034
05:47:35,500 --> 05:47:37,860
This is a lot more difficult.

8035
05:47:38,500 --> 05:47:40,220
This... Let me eat my lasagna.

8036
05:47:40,860 --> 05:47:48,220
That was... That was a lot more difficult than I expected.

8037
05:47:48,220 --> 05:47:50,700
I need to eat my lasagna.

8038
05:47:50,800 --> 05:47:50,920
I need to eat my lasagna.

8039
05:47:56,190 --> 05:47:57,630
What the fuck?

8040
05:47:58,050 --> 05:47:59,410
Like, what do I do?

8041
05:48:05,370 --> 05:48:06,650
Oh my god.

8042
05:48:08,390 --> 05:48:08,950
Okay.

8043
05:48:10,150 --> 05:48:12,210
Let the first wave come to you.

8044
05:48:16,080 --> 05:48:16,640
Okay.

8045
05:48:17,060 --> 05:48:18,100
We'll do that next time.

8046
05:48:23,590 --> 05:48:24,150
Okay.

8047
05:48:24,230 --> 05:48:26,970
I'm gonna not pick up Guan... I'm gonna restart the battle.

8048
05:48:27,310 --> 05:48:29,210
And then not pick up Guan Yin.

8049
05:48:30,290 --> 05:48:33,390
Because apparently, Guan Yin will defend the altar.

8050
05:48:33,890 --> 05:48:36,330
And like, I trust him more than John Pei.

8051
05:48:41,430 --> 05:48:41,910
Okay.

8052
05:48:42,050 --> 05:48:45,350
We're gonna... Okay.

8053
05:48:46,310 --> 05:48:48,210
Actually, do we keep Guan Yin with us?

8054
05:48:48,550 --> 05:48:50,290
Or... get someone else?

8055
05:48:50,810 --> 05:48:52,870
Guys, do we keep Guan Yin with us?

8056
05:49:02,420 --> 05:49:03,060
I don't know.

8057
05:49:03,100 --> 05:49:04,100
We should keep him with us.

8058
05:49:04,160 --> 05:49:05,740
Because he does kill people faster.

8059
05:49:14,480 --> 05:49:15,540
Go solo?

8060
05:49:16,360 --> 05:49:16,400
Go solo?

8061
05:49:16,400 --> 05:49:17,480
But like...

8062
05:49:18,260 --> 05:49:19,700
They're so strong!

8063
05:49:25,340 --> 05:49:25,980
Okay.

8064
05:49:25,980 --> 05:49:26,080
Okay.

8065
05:49:26,180 --> 05:49:27,060
We quit the battle.

8066
05:49:27,380 --> 05:49:29,480
And then... we do this.

8067
05:49:33,380 --> 05:49:34,800
It's easier to do solo?

8068
05:49:35,100 --> 05:49:35,240
Okay.

8069
05:49:35,300 --> 05:49:36,360
We'll do... we'll try solo.

8070
05:49:36,660 --> 05:49:37,920
We'll try solo then.

8071
05:49:41,800 --> 05:49:42,400
Alright.

8072
05:49:47,890 --> 05:49:48,490
Alright.

8073
05:49:48,870 --> 05:49:49,130
Alright.

8074
05:49:49,130 --> 05:49:50,310
It's time to go solo.

8075
05:49:51,050 --> 05:49:52,150
I'm solo.

8076
05:49:52,450 --> 05:49:52,990
I'm solo.

8077
05:49:53,910 --> 05:49:54,510
I'm solo.

8078
05:49:59,550 --> 05:50:01,150
Yeah, I'm gonna change weapons.

8079
05:50:01,610 --> 05:50:03,890
I only was using it because it was stronger.

8080
05:50:04,190 --> 05:50:05,910
But I don't think it's as good.

8081
05:50:07,590 --> 05:50:08,190
Alright.

8082
05:50:08,690 --> 05:50:09,750
We've done all that...

8083
05:50:11,690 --> 05:50:12,130
We've done all that...

8084
05:50:12,130 --> 05:50:13,890
I'm not like... I don't like it as much.

8085
05:50:14,050 --> 05:50:14,670
Not gonna lie.

8086
05:50:20,910 --> 05:50:21,410
I feel like...

8087
05:50:21,990 --> 05:50:23,950
Maybe I'll use the Cobalt Storm.

8088
05:50:24,350 --> 05:50:26,550
Maybe I'll do... I'll be more... feel better with this.

8089
05:50:26,750 --> 05:50:28,130
We must support each other and fight our way through.

8090
05:50:28,310 --> 05:50:28,570
Okay.

8091
05:50:28,650 --> 05:50:29,630
I'll let them come to me.

8092
05:50:29,830 --> 05:50:30,530
Show them your metal.

8093
05:50:31,430 --> 05:50:33,950
This battle... is ours for the taking.

8094
05:50:34,830 --> 05:50:37,010
For the sake of our inalienable ambitions.

8095
05:50:37,390 --> 05:50:40,310
But I'll kill them and then I'll ignore Sha Hu Yun.

8096
05:50:41,810 --> 05:50:43,150
I'll ignore Sha Hu Yun.

8097
05:50:43,930 --> 05:50:45,550
And I'll go to the other side.

8098
05:50:47,910 --> 05:50:48,430
Yes!

8099
05:50:48,690 --> 05:50:49,630
They come down first!

8100
05:50:49,930 --> 05:50:52,770
All of my plans depend on this decisive battle.

8101
05:50:53,690 --> 05:50:56,470
Each and every one of you must carry out your duties.

8102
05:50:56,790 --> 05:50:59,470
So that we may claim a crushing victory.

8103
05:51:01,470 --> 05:51:02,570
First, we shall...

8104
05:51:04,210 --> 05:51:04,730
Send...

8105
05:51:04,730 --> 05:51:05,630
Defense now!

8106
05:51:08,530 --> 05:51:09,890
All units...

8107
05:51:09,890 --> 05:51:11,570
Can I actually like redo my...

8108
05:51:11,570 --> 05:51:12,090
Oh, I can't.

8109
05:51:12,430 --> 05:51:13,490
I was gonna say...

8110
05:51:13,490 --> 05:51:15,150
Can I like fix my inventory?

8111
05:51:17,130 --> 05:51:18,550
Apparently I can't.

8112
05:51:19,390 --> 05:51:20,410
That's not good.

8113
05:51:21,670 --> 05:51:22,430
Alright.

8114
05:51:24,630 --> 05:51:25,530
Let's see.

8115
05:51:28,150 --> 05:51:29,430
Strengthen your guard!

8116
05:51:30,490 --> 05:51:31,810
Repel the hostile offensive!

8117
05:51:31,810 --> 05:51:35,630
This one and then kill at least one or two and then we'll go to the other side.

8118
05:51:35,810 --> 05:51:36,950
Our chance of victory remains.

8119
05:51:38,610 --> 05:51:39,410
Hold formation.

8120
05:51:39,610 --> 05:51:39,890
Is this...

8121
05:51:39,890 --> 05:51:40,730
These guys are first.

8122
05:51:41,030 --> 05:51:41,230
Stay on the defensive.

8123
05:51:46,120 --> 05:51:47,240
Okay, it comes to me.

8124
05:51:51,280 --> 05:51:53,320
Open up, open up, open up, open up.

8125
05:51:53,760 --> 05:51:55,340
We will not let anyone through.

8126
05:51:55,980 --> 05:51:57,900
Come out with all you have.

8127
05:51:58,900 --> 05:52:00,640
We must not let them reach land.

8128
05:52:01,820 --> 05:52:03,700
Lose arrows at will with all my might.

8129
05:52:03,700 --> 05:52:04,680
Boom!

8130
05:52:05,820 --> 05:52:07,460
Oh my god, that was fast.

8131
05:52:08,760 --> 05:52:09,260
Alright.

8132
05:52:09,700 --> 05:52:09,880
Nice.

8133
05:52:10,080 --> 05:52:10,960
I can't believe this.

8134
05:52:11,080 --> 05:52:13,360
The enemy officer has been defeated.

8135
05:52:13,520 --> 05:52:15,960
I could test my skills against you.

8136
05:52:19,280 --> 05:52:19,940
Oh dude.

8137
05:52:21,200 --> 05:52:22,020
Oh no, that's bad.

8138
05:52:22,740 --> 05:52:23,480
Oh nice.

8139
05:52:23,700 --> 05:52:24,800
I dodged it in time.

8140
05:52:25,220 --> 05:52:26,800
And I actually used it anyway.

8141
05:52:31,660 --> 05:52:32,420
Nice.

8142
05:52:33,020 --> 05:52:34,480
And then...

8143
05:52:34,480 --> 05:52:35,360
I leave!

8144
05:52:36,200 --> 05:52:40,600
The enemy officer has been defeated.

8145
05:52:40,860 --> 05:52:40,880
Alright, goodbye!

8146
05:52:41,280 --> 05:52:43,800
We can't let them take this position.

8147
05:52:44,260 --> 05:52:46,120
I must hold it.

8148
05:52:46,580 --> 05:52:47,520
I'm coming over!

8149
05:52:49,700 --> 05:52:50,760
Don't worry!

8150
05:52:51,220 --> 05:52:51,260
Oh my god, they're so...

8151
05:52:51,260 --> 05:52:51,280
Far!

8152
05:52:51,280 --> 05:52:51,380
Oh my god, they're so far!

8153
05:52:51,380 --> 05:52:51,420
Oh my god!

8154
05:52:51,420 --> 05:52:51,480
I'm coming over!

8155
05:52:54,400 --> 05:52:57,020
Oh my god, they're so far!

8156
05:52:59,860 --> 05:53:03,720
Oh my god, I'm riding the horse as fast as I can!

8157
05:53:07,780 --> 05:53:08,540
Please!

8158
05:53:09,180 --> 05:53:11,280
Why aren't you faster?!

8159
05:53:11,280 --> 05:53:14,180
Oh my god.

8160
05:53:15,220 --> 05:53:17,820
Across the entire map too!

8161
05:53:18,280 --> 05:53:26,040
I don't... I'm actually... I'm actually riding the horse as fast as I can!

8162
05:53:26,040 --> 05:53:27,860
To the other side!

8163
05:53:28,160 --> 05:53:30,360
There's, like, no other way I can go faster!

8164
05:53:30,520 --> 05:53:33,320
Like, I don't understand what they want from me.

8165
05:53:36,220 --> 05:53:38,940
There's no other way for me to be faster.

8166
05:53:42,540 --> 05:53:44,080
Oh my god.

8167
05:53:46,840 --> 05:53:48,320
I think this is the worst part.

8168
05:53:48,540 --> 05:53:50,280
Like, it's, like, actually so hard.

8169
05:53:56,080 --> 05:53:56,820
Okay, hello.

8170
05:53:58,580 --> 05:53:59,260
Hello.

8171
05:53:59,560 --> 05:54:01,800
You must maintain a constant barrage of arrows.

8172
05:54:02,300 --> 05:54:02,640
I...

8173
05:54:02,980 --> 05:54:06,020
Keep the enemy reinforcements at bay to protect our archers.

8174
05:54:09,560 --> 05:54:10,240
There's no way!

8175
05:54:10,240 --> 05:54:10,500
Take this!

8176
05:54:10,880 --> 05:54:13,020
We may not be able to make it through this.

8177
05:54:13,120 --> 05:54:14,200
There's no way!

8178
05:54:14,380 --> 05:54:14,960
There's no way!

8179
05:54:15,880 --> 05:54:17,580
Things don't look too good.

8180
05:54:22,540 --> 05:54:23,900
I can't...

8181
05:54:23,900 --> 05:54:26,340
They took me off!

8182
05:54:26,920 --> 05:54:28,960
I have to restart!

8183
05:54:28,960 --> 05:54:29,940
You are...

8184
05:54:29,940 --> 05:54:34,960
I can't...

8185
05:54:34,960 --> 05:54:35,880
EXCUSE ME!

8186
05:54:41,080 --> 05:54:43,100
There's no way!

8187
05:54:45,020 --> 05:54:46,480
There's no way!

8188
05:54:48,000 --> 05:54:49,920
I'm- I'm restarting.

8189
05:54:50,120 --> 05:54:51,660
I'm- I'm restarting.

8190
05:54:51,780 --> 05:54:55,500
I can't find the ladder.

8191
05:55:01,340 --> 05:55:04,940
He knocked me into the...

8192
05:55:05,620 --> 05:55:07,260
There's no way!

8193
05:55:11,960 --> 05:55:13,780
Is this where I'm in the water?

8194
05:55:14,180 --> 05:55:18,780
Is this where- I'm so sad!

8195
05:55:19,440 --> 05:55:21,100
I- I'm actually so sad!

8196
05:55:24,480 --> 05:55:25,640
Wait, you're right.

8197
05:55:26,200 --> 05:55:28,560
Okay, let me, um, do my skills real quick.

8198
05:55:28,880 --> 05:55:30,760
I'm so sad that happened.

8199
05:55:31,100 --> 05:55:36,860
I can't believe- I can't believe I was sent to the fucking Shadow Realm.

8200
05:55:38,500 --> 05:55:39,100
Um...

8201
05:55:39,100 --> 05:55:40,720
That's actually bullshit.

8202
05:55:40,720 --> 05:55:41,340
Show them your metal!

8203
05:55:41,940 --> 05:55:44,820
This battle is ours for the taking!

8204
05:55:45,620 --> 05:55:47,920
For the sake of our inalienable ambitions.

8205
05:55:49,000 --> 05:55:51,080
We must take command of this battle!

8206
05:55:51,240 --> 05:55:52,300
Oh, I finished my lasagna.

8207
05:55:52,320 --> 05:55:53,640
I was so fucking hungry.

8208
05:55:54,200 --> 05:55:55,380
I actually finished it already.

8209
05:55:55,380 --> 05:55:56,460
Yeah!

8210
05:55:57,660 --> 05:55:58,440
Hmph!

8211
05:56:00,220 --> 05:56:03,440
All of my- I told you!

8212
05:56:03,720 --> 05:56:05,000
I was hungry!

8213
05:56:06,260 --> 05:56:07,280
All units!

8214
05:56:07,900 --> 05:56:09,240
Strengthen your guard!

8215
05:56:09,940 --> 05:56:11,780
Repel the hostile offensive!

8216
05:56:12,720 --> 05:56:17,140
As long as we hold firm, our chance of victory remains.

8217
05:56:18,100 --> 05:56:21,000
Hold formation, and stay on the defensive.

8218
05:56:21,000 --> 05:56:22,060
Get over here!

8219
05:56:23,380 --> 05:56:25,840
There's still some remaining lasagna sauce.

8220
05:56:32,000 --> 05:56:33,300
Wait, what is that?

8221
05:56:33,780 --> 05:56:35,600
Anyway, the dragon tail spike.

8222
05:56:37,200 --> 05:56:38,220
Oh, wait, that's a good move.

8223
05:56:38,420 --> 05:56:38,740
Okay.

8224
05:56:43,200 --> 05:56:45,360
I'm so, so sad that happened.

8225
05:56:45,540 --> 05:56:47,140
I can't believe that happened.

8226
05:56:47,660 --> 05:56:49,360
I can't believe it.

8227
05:56:49,360 --> 05:56:50,620
We will not let anyone through.

8228
05:56:51,140 --> 05:56:53,040
That's all you have.

8229
05:56:53,940 --> 05:56:55,860
We must not let them reach land.

8230
05:56:56,920 --> 05:56:58,160
Noose arrows at will!

8231
05:56:58,780 --> 05:56:59,540
Let's go.

8232
05:57:01,140 --> 05:57:01,700
Easy.

8233
05:57:02,420 --> 05:57:02,640
Hit.

8234
05:57:07,460 --> 05:57:08,580
Jesus Christ.

8235
05:57:08,620 --> 05:57:11,220
I could test my skills against you!

8236
05:57:12,580 --> 05:57:13,820
Oh my God!

8237
05:57:14,100 --> 05:57:14,840
Get out!

8238
05:57:17,180 --> 05:57:19,080
You're not part of this!

8239
05:57:22,540 --> 05:57:24,760
Oh my, this takes so much heart longer.

8240
05:57:24,760 --> 05:57:28,760
This is actually taking so much longer because of the harder boss.

8241
05:57:33,160 --> 05:57:34,640
Oh my God.

8242
05:57:35,460 --> 05:57:36,600
I have to go back.

8243
05:57:37,180 --> 05:57:37,440
Let's go.

8244
05:57:38,320 --> 05:57:39,200
I'm sorry.

8245
05:57:40,420 --> 05:57:43,320
Wait, actually, I can maybe kill one more guy.

8246
05:57:45,440 --> 05:57:47,180
I can maybe kill one more.

8247
05:57:48,420 --> 05:57:48,980
Okay.

8248
05:57:54,780 --> 05:57:55,900
Jesus Christ.

8249
05:57:56,440 --> 05:57:57,880
I could kill him, maybe.

8250
05:57:58,500 --> 05:57:58,920
Time to act.

8251
05:58:00,300 --> 05:58:02,160
Everything is going well so far.

8252
05:58:02,580 --> 05:58:05,280
I'd say it's just about time to land another boom.

8253
05:58:05,720 --> 05:58:06,060
Alright.

8254
05:58:06,780 --> 05:58:07,340
Okay.

8255
05:58:07,560 --> 05:58:07,940
Goodbye!

8256
05:58:10,820 --> 05:58:11,300
Goodbye.

8257
05:58:11,440 --> 05:58:11,760
Damn.

8258
05:58:12,440 --> 05:58:13,700
When did they get behind us?

8259
05:58:14,160 --> 05:58:14,680
Oh my God.

8260
05:58:14,680 --> 05:58:16,320
This just became a lot more complicated.

8261
05:58:16,640 --> 05:58:16,740
Wait.

8262
05:58:17,500 --> 05:58:17,740
Okay.

8263
05:58:18,120 --> 05:58:18,840
This is bad.

8264
05:58:19,480 --> 05:58:22,620
If someone doesn't get here fast, we're done for.

8265
05:58:22,840 --> 05:58:24,760
Oh my God, I'm trying my best.

8266
05:58:24,960 --> 05:58:26,600
Okay, I'll kill these guys too.

8267
05:58:32,360 --> 05:58:32,880
Oh, wait.

8268
05:58:32,980 --> 05:58:33,340
No, no, no.

8269
05:58:33,400 --> 05:58:33,680
I can't.

8270
05:58:33,740 --> 05:58:34,520
I can't afford to.

8271
05:58:34,620 --> 05:58:35,100
I'm sorry.

8272
05:58:35,340 --> 05:58:36,480
I have to go.

8273
05:58:36,660 --> 05:58:36,980
No!

8274
05:58:38,620 --> 05:58:41,000
We must maintain a barrage of arrows.

8275
05:58:42,160 --> 05:58:43,840
Keep the enemy reinforcements at bay.

8276
05:58:43,960 --> 05:58:45,060
Okay, but I'll kill him first.

8277
05:58:45,160 --> 05:58:45,580
I'll kill him.

8278
05:58:45,680 --> 05:58:46,260
I'll kill him first.

8279
05:58:46,360 --> 05:58:47,000
This is more important.

8280
05:58:54,780 --> 05:58:55,420
Oh, fuck.

8281
05:58:56,260 --> 05:58:58,420
We may not be able to make it through this.

8282
05:58:59,180 --> 05:59:03,180
Oh my God, this is so strong.

8283
05:59:03,720 --> 05:59:07,940
If we lose this one, I'm gonna go and equip like strong items and stuff.

8284
05:59:08,240 --> 05:59:10,500
So I can be stronger in this fight.

8285
05:59:11,560 --> 05:59:13,780
So I can kill people faster at least.

8286
05:59:14,320 --> 05:59:15,900
Because things are not okay.

8287
05:59:16,340 --> 05:59:17,820
Things are not okay right now.

8288
05:59:18,820 --> 05:59:20,180
They're too strong.

8289
05:59:20,880 --> 05:59:23,280
I must retreat and rethink my plans.

8290
05:59:27,720 --> 05:59:36,240
Oh my God, they made this fight so much harder than the previous installations.

8291
05:59:37,840 --> 05:59:40,980
This fight is actually crazy hard.

8292
05:59:42,760 --> 05:59:43,720
Yes, please.

8293
05:59:44,020 --> 05:59:45,480
Please let me duel you.

8294
05:59:46,040 --> 05:59:47,520
This makes it easier.

8295
05:59:48,920 --> 05:59:50,640
Let me duel you.

8296
05:59:51,780 --> 05:59:52,860
Oh, thank God.

8297
05:59:58,240 --> 05:59:59,480
I'm so happy.

8298
05:59:59,920 --> 06:00:01,440
He let me duel him.

8299
06:00:02,360 --> 06:00:03,860
It makes this so much easier.

8300
06:00:04,520 --> 06:00:06,520
One less guy I have to worry about.

8301
06:00:08,000 --> 06:00:08,720
Let's go.

8302
06:00:09,440 --> 06:00:10,580
Get out of here.

8303
06:00:11,880 --> 06:00:12,740
Oh, shit.

8304
06:00:13,040 --> 06:00:13,700
Yo, my perfect run.

8305
06:00:16,280 --> 06:00:16,820
Hit.

8306
06:00:17,640 --> 06:00:18,180
No.

8307
06:00:18,580 --> 06:00:19,080
Oh my God.

8308
06:00:19,200 --> 06:00:19,420
No.

8309
06:00:19,660 --> 06:00:20,060
No.

8310
06:00:20,180 --> 06:00:20,240
No.

8311
06:00:21,820 --> 06:00:22,720
Oh my God.

8312
06:00:22,780 --> 06:00:22,840
No.

8313
06:00:22,840 --> 06:00:23,560
That's cheating.

8314
06:00:28,620 --> 06:00:29,620
No, it's fine.

8315
06:00:30,680 --> 06:00:31,280
It's fine.

8316
06:00:32,360 --> 06:00:33,220
With all my might.

8317
06:00:35,600 --> 06:00:36,220
No.

8318
06:00:36,620 --> 06:00:36,880
Come on.

8319
06:00:37,180 --> 06:00:37,800
Nice.

8320
06:00:38,820 --> 06:00:39,900
We're so close.

8321
06:00:43,580 --> 06:00:44,200
Yes.

8322
06:00:44,780 --> 06:00:45,820
Oh, thank God.

8323
06:00:48,280 --> 06:00:49,320
Thank God.

8324
06:00:49,480 --> 06:00:50,000
We made it.

8325
06:00:50,020 --> 06:00:50,240
It's time.

8326
06:00:50,440 --> 06:00:50,700
It's been defeated.

8327
06:00:52,440 --> 06:00:52,960
I'm...

8328
06:00:52,960 --> 06:00:53,580
He's...

8329
06:00:53,580 --> 06:00:54,240
Heading...

8330
06:00:54,240 --> 06:00:54,480
Let's go.

8331
06:00:54,620 --> 06:00:54,880
The altar.

8332
06:00:56,500 --> 06:00:57,020
Why?

8333
06:00:59,860 --> 06:01:01,020
That white fan.

8334
06:01:01,140 --> 06:01:01,980
His appearance.

8335
06:01:02,440 --> 06:01:04,560
That must be the sleeping dragon.

8336
06:01:04,800 --> 06:01:05,300
Chugen Leong.

8337
06:01:05,620 --> 06:01:08,880
As long as he lives, he is sure to be a thorn in our side.

8338
06:01:09,080 --> 06:01:09,720
The enemy officer.

8339
06:01:10,200 --> 06:01:10,740
March forward.

8340
06:01:11,820 --> 06:01:12,560
Got this.

8341
06:01:13,260 --> 06:01:14,520
Okay, I'll kill two more.

8342
06:01:14,680 --> 06:01:16,800
And then I'll go to the other side.

8343
06:01:17,420 --> 06:01:18,020
Let's go.

8344
06:01:18,220 --> 06:01:20,140
This is in line with my predictions.

8345
06:01:20,500 --> 06:01:20,880
Okay.

8346
06:01:21,460 --> 06:01:22,120
Get him out.

8347
06:01:22,360 --> 06:01:23,000
What the heck took you so long?

8348
06:01:23,800 --> 06:01:24,120
All right.

8349
06:01:24,280 --> 06:01:24,480
Just kidding.

8350
06:01:24,860 --> 06:01:26,080
We're going to the other side.

8351
06:01:26,080 --> 06:01:26,240
We're going to the other side.

8352
06:01:26,640 --> 06:01:27,260
Has been defeated.

8353
06:01:27,640 --> 06:01:27,780
Come.

8354
06:01:28,560 --> 06:01:29,700
And face me.

8355
06:01:30,020 --> 06:01:30,860
Who's the other guy?

8356
06:01:31,500 --> 06:01:32,300
Oh, my God.

8357
06:01:32,420 --> 06:01:32,740
It's him.

8358
06:01:33,220 --> 06:01:35,120
Those things aren't going my way today.

8359
06:01:36,260 --> 06:01:37,560
Maybe next time.

8360
06:01:38,720 --> 06:01:39,500
This is tough.

8361
06:01:39,700 --> 06:01:41,240
No matter how you slice it.

8362
06:01:42,020 --> 06:01:43,080
Don't worry, Dracos.

8363
06:01:43,200 --> 06:01:43,820
Go do your thing.

8364
06:01:43,960 --> 06:01:44,820
The outcome of this encounter.

8365
06:01:46,600 --> 06:01:47,720
Oh, no.

8366
06:01:49,780 --> 06:01:50,340
Okay.

8367
06:01:50,520 --> 06:01:50,680
Sorry.

8368
06:01:50,820 --> 06:01:51,360
I have to leave now.

8369
06:01:51,660 --> 06:01:52,140
I leave.

8370
06:01:53,180 --> 06:01:54,080
I leave.

8371
06:01:54,500 --> 06:01:55,800
I gotta leave now.

8372
06:01:56,060 --> 06:01:57,900
I have to go to the other side.

8373
06:01:58,340 --> 06:02:00,640
Oh, my God.

8374
06:02:01,260 --> 06:02:02,820
You guys got this, right?

8375
06:02:03,120 --> 06:02:04,160
I gotta leave.

8376
06:02:04,980 --> 06:02:06,100
They're complaining.

8377
06:02:06,760 --> 06:02:07,600
They're complaining.

8378
06:02:08,040 --> 06:02:12,100
We must distract the enemy while carrying out the most vital part of the plan.

8379
06:02:13,160 --> 06:02:14,700
I know this will be hard.

8380
06:02:15,460 --> 06:02:16,000
But...

8381
06:02:16,000 --> 06:02:17,140
Oh, my God.

8382
06:02:17,420 --> 06:02:18,580
I am counting on you all.

8383
06:02:18,660 --> 06:02:19,120
Oh, my God.

8384
06:02:19,260 --> 06:02:22,480
I'm fucking riding the horse as fast as I can.

8385
06:02:22,480 --> 06:02:23,040
We've losing this battle.

8386
06:02:23,780 --> 06:02:24,100
We've losing this battle.

8387
06:02:24,100 --> 06:02:25,180
Guard him with your lives.

8388
06:02:27,260 --> 06:02:28,340
Jesus Christ.

8389
06:02:28,340 --> 06:02:28,440
You guys.

8390
06:02:29,260 --> 06:02:31,380
We've lost our archers in the east.

8391
06:02:31,820 --> 06:02:32,400
What?

8392
06:02:32,860 --> 06:02:35,220
The enemy's offensive will go on unimpededly.

8393
06:02:35,340 --> 06:02:35,400
How?

8394
06:02:36,680 --> 06:02:37,820
How do we lose?

8395
06:02:38,000 --> 06:02:40,000
I've left for one second.

8396
06:02:40,360 --> 06:02:43,540
How is our chance to press the attack and take victory for ourselves?

8397
06:02:44,060 --> 06:02:45,160
How do we lose?

8398
06:02:45,160 --> 06:02:45,580
What?

8399
06:02:45,580 --> 06:02:46,940
I did not...

8400
06:02:46,940 --> 06:02:49,120
Who is ours for the enemy officer...

8401
06:02:49,120 --> 06:02:50,280
...has been defeated.

8402
06:02:50,800 --> 06:02:51,980
How do we lose?

8403
06:02:52,100 --> 06:02:52,580
I haven't already.

8404
06:02:53,220 --> 06:02:53,760
How?

8405
06:02:54,240 --> 06:02:54,880
How?

8406
06:02:54,920 --> 06:02:55,540
Still...

8407
06:02:55,540 --> 06:02:56,740
It's not yet time.

8408
06:02:57,240 --> 06:02:58,340
I don't understand.

8409
06:03:03,040 --> 06:03:04,800
Oh my god.

8410
06:03:08,400 --> 06:03:11,080
I know, I went back to save Jukotlen!

8411
06:03:11,880 --> 06:03:14,780
I don't understand how we lost them already!

8412
06:03:15,420 --> 06:03:16,940
Oh my god!

8413
06:03:17,320 --> 06:03:18,620
I can't!

8414
06:03:21,680 --> 06:03:26,600
Alright, we're gonna... Alright guys, we're gonna do a level...

8415
06:03:30,240 --> 06:03:35,680
Okay, guys, we need to... We need to... We gotta... Grind a little.

8416
06:03:37,960 --> 06:03:39,100
We're too strong.

8417
06:03:40,100 --> 06:03:42,740
Lucas, thank you for the 50 gifted chips!

8418
06:03:42,960 --> 06:03:44,160
Thank you, thank you!

8419
06:03:44,560 --> 06:03:48,620
We got our... We may or may not have got our asses kicked.

8420
06:03:49,000 --> 06:03:52,360
So I'm gonna... I'm gonna level it up.

8421
06:03:53,680 --> 06:03:54,980
I'm gonna...

8422
06:03:54,980 --> 06:03:58,820
I'm gonna... I'm gonna find some level up areas.

8423
06:03:59,160 --> 06:04:00,640
I do not care who moves this place.

8424
06:04:01,080 --> 06:04:03,640
Thank you so much for the 50 gifted chips!

8425
06:04:03,840 --> 06:04:04,760
Thank you, thank you!

8426
06:04:04,960 --> 06:04:05,880
I don't know if I like this.

8427
06:04:06,000 --> 06:04:06,400
I'll try it.

8428
06:04:06,480 --> 06:04:07,160
Maybe I'll try it.

8429
06:04:07,500 --> 06:04:10,400
This... The thing is, this doesn't kill as fast.

8430
06:04:10,580 --> 06:04:13,460
So like... What is the strongest weapon?

8431
06:04:14,520 --> 06:04:17,660
Guys, what is the strongest weapon in this game?

8432
06:04:18,100 --> 06:04:19,920
Like, in terms of like play style.

8433
06:04:26,360 --> 06:04:28,580
Yeah, there's consumables that make me stronger.

8434
06:04:36,130 --> 06:04:36,810
Howlbred?

8435
06:04:36,810 --> 06:04:38,810
Okay, but like... We don't have that.

8436
06:04:40,930 --> 06:04:44,910
We don't... What is the strongest weapons that I have right now?

8437
06:04:45,370 --> 06:04:48,350
That... That I... Currently own?

8438
06:04:56,890 --> 06:04:58,150
Which is the best?

8439
06:05:00,310 --> 06:05:01,270
Crescent blade?

8440
06:05:01,510 --> 06:05:02,690
Okay, I'll try Crescent blade.

8441
06:05:05,900 --> 06:05:07,800
So Lord Southside... Spear?

8442
06:05:07,920 --> 06:05:11,140
I mean, the spear has been like... Good for me for a while.

8443
06:05:11,360 --> 06:05:12,080
I'll try the spear.

8444
06:05:15,730 --> 06:05:16,290
Alright.

8445
06:05:16,810 --> 06:05:17,830
We'll do this.

8446
06:05:18,730 --> 06:05:22,150
We... We need to grind ourselves a little bit.

8447
06:05:26,870 --> 06:05:32,270
I realize that... We are... We might be a little fucked right now.

8448
06:05:32,270 --> 06:05:39,310
We might... We may or may not... Be a little fucked at the moment.

8449
06:05:40,610 --> 06:05:41,690
Everyone wait.

8450
06:05:42,010 --> 06:05:44,090
I must assess the situation.

8451
06:05:45,450 --> 06:05:45,470
Hey!

8452
06:05:46,310 --> 06:05:47,630
Tajo turns our knee.

8453
06:05:48,450 --> 06:05:49,430
Let's move!

8454
06:05:49,810 --> 06:05:50,050
Alright.

8455
06:05:50,670 --> 06:05:51,270
Take that!

8456
06:05:51,510 --> 06:05:51,850
Now!

8457
06:05:53,290 --> 06:05:54,650
Take this!

8458
06:05:54,930 --> 06:05:55,130
Take that!

8459
06:05:55,270 --> 06:05:55,570
Time to ask.

8460
06:05:55,570 --> 06:05:55,710
Okay.

8461
06:05:56,430 --> 06:05:56,950
Let's...

8462
06:05:58,310 --> 06:06:00,530
Grind spirit proficiency to level 8.

8463
06:06:00,730 --> 06:06:01,190
One... Okay.

8464
06:06:01,370 --> 06:06:03,270
To get the... Dragon Flash?

8465
06:06:03,550 --> 06:06:03,810
Okay.

8466
06:06:04,210 --> 06:06:05,770
But not ha... I don't have that yet, right?

8467
06:06:05,990 --> 06:06:06,990
I don't know if I do.

8468
06:06:07,190 --> 06:06:07,430
Let's go.

8469
06:06:09,490 --> 06:06:10,010
Okay.

8470
06:06:10,050 --> 06:06:13,370
We might try and grind the objectives too at this point.

8471
06:06:14,310 --> 06:06:17,090
At this point, we might actually have to.

8472
06:06:17,750 --> 06:06:21,450
We... We need as much... As much as we can get.

8473
06:06:21,450 --> 06:06:22,010
Okay.

8474
06:06:22,010 --> 06:06:23,630
What is the battle hearts first?

8475
06:06:26,110 --> 06:06:26,670
Wait.

8476
06:06:26,870 --> 06:06:27,310
Open the door.

8477
06:06:28,010 --> 06:06:28,570
Open.

8478
06:06:38,410 --> 06:06:38,970
Alright.

8479
06:06:40,130 --> 06:06:40,410
Yeah.

8480
06:06:40,530 --> 06:06:42,490
We... We paid to win a lot of stuff.

8481
06:06:42,750 --> 06:06:43,330
So, like...

8482
06:06:43,330 --> 06:06:46,510
I think it's time that... We actually have to...

8483
06:06:48,710 --> 06:06:51,130
We actually have to, you know...

8484
06:06:53,990 --> 06:06:55,430
Level up some stuff.

8485
06:06:57,110 --> 06:06:57,790
That's a hundred.

8486
06:06:58,970 --> 06:06:59,570
Okay.

8487
06:07:01,470 --> 06:07:02,510
Open the door.

8488
06:07:02,690 --> 06:07:03,210
I'm ready.

8489
06:07:03,890 --> 06:07:05,070
I'm fucking ready.

8490
06:07:08,370 --> 06:07:09,190
I'm ready.

8491
06:07:09,390 --> 06:07:10,630
I'm going in by myself.

8492
06:07:12,530 --> 06:07:13,430
That's right!

8493
06:07:14,210 --> 06:07:14,810
Charge!

8494
06:07:15,090 --> 06:07:16,370
It's only me!

8495
06:07:17,350 --> 06:07:17,950
Wait.

8496
06:07:17,950 --> 06:07:19,670
Why is everybody charging without me?

8497
06:07:19,810 --> 06:07:20,030
Guys.

8498
06:07:20,150 --> 06:07:20,690
I'm right here.

8499
06:07:21,390 --> 06:07:21,610
Guys.

8500
06:07:21,890 --> 06:07:22,090
Guys.

8501
06:07:22,230 --> 06:07:22,890
Why is...

8502
06:07:22,890 --> 06:07:23,450
Guys.

8503
06:07:23,950 --> 06:07:24,550
Guys.

8504
06:07:24,550 --> 06:07:25,390
I'm right here.

8505
06:07:25,390 --> 06:07:26,230
Guys.

8506
06:07:26,230 --> 06:07:26,770
Guys.

8507
06:07:26,910 --> 06:07:27,850
Why are you guys...

8508
06:07:27,850 --> 06:07:27,850
Guys.

8509
06:07:27,950 --> 06:07:28,750
I'm right... Guys.

8510
06:07:29,110 --> 06:07:29,750
Guys.

8511
06:07:30,330 --> 06:07:30,550
Guys.

8512
06:07:32,150 --> 06:07:32,810
Oh, shit.

8513
06:07:32,810 --> 06:07:33,570
There he is.

8514
06:07:35,430 --> 06:07:36,590
Oh, my God.

8515
06:07:47,790 --> 06:07:49,970
Thousand people right off the...

8516
06:07:50,350 --> 06:07:51,670
Oh, my God.

8517
06:07:52,430 --> 06:07:54,170
You know what else I could do?

8518
06:07:54,170 --> 06:07:55,290
I could do that again.

8519
06:08:04,570 --> 06:08:06,190
I could do that again.

8520
06:08:06,310 --> 06:08:06,350
I could do that again.

8521
06:08:06,410 --> 06:08:07,450
You know what I could also do again?

8522
06:08:07,850 --> 06:08:08,150
This.

8523
06:08:09,290 --> 06:08:09,770
I...

8524
06:08:13,630 --> 06:08:14,110
Jesus.

8525
06:08:18,180 --> 06:08:18,860
All right.

8526
06:08:19,100 --> 06:08:19,320
Nice.

8527
06:08:19,640 --> 06:08:22,020
Where are the chariots, by the way?

8528
06:08:22,840 --> 06:08:23,400
Oh.

8529
06:08:23,880 --> 06:08:26,160
Oh, they're all the way over there.

8530
06:08:26,860 --> 06:08:27,920
I was like, don't worry.

8531
06:08:28,040 --> 06:08:28,880
I got this.

8532
06:08:29,080 --> 06:08:29,740
And I...

8533
06:08:29,740 --> 06:08:31,120
I was ready.

8534
06:08:32,900 --> 06:08:34,640
Apparently, the chariots were all...

8535
06:08:34,640 --> 06:08:35,080
Don't worry.

8536
06:08:35,820 --> 06:08:36,320
Boom.

8537
06:08:37,620 --> 06:08:38,180
Jesus.

8538
06:08:41,180 --> 06:08:41,620
All right.

8539
06:08:41,860 --> 06:08:42,460
Two thousand.

8540
06:08:45,560 --> 06:08:48,360
You are a true warrior of the three kingdoms.

8541
06:08:48,880 --> 06:08:49,660
There we go.

8542
06:08:49,880 --> 06:08:51,020
There you go, guys.

8543
06:08:52,360 --> 06:08:53,540
That should be enough.

8544
06:08:53,780 --> 06:08:55,460
That should be a lot of XP, right?

8545
06:08:55,980 --> 06:08:57,340
And there's 2K.

8546
06:08:58,700 --> 06:08:59,240
All right.

8547
06:08:59,320 --> 06:09:00,280
You know what it's time to do?

8548
06:09:00,520 --> 06:09:00,960
Boom.

8549
06:09:04,000 --> 06:09:04,740
Here we...

8550
06:09:05,300 --> 06:09:06,260
Here we go again.

8551
06:09:08,960 --> 06:09:09,620
All right.

8552
06:09:09,620 --> 06:09:10,560
Again?

8553
06:09:14,630 --> 06:09:15,110
Okay.

8554
06:09:15,190 --> 06:09:15,950
What do I have to do here?

8555
06:09:18,190 --> 06:09:19,610
Oh, prevent his musu?

8556
06:09:19,770 --> 06:09:20,350
Where is it?

8557
06:09:22,090 --> 06:09:23,090
Oh, there it is.

8558
06:09:25,610 --> 06:09:26,090
Okay.

8559
06:09:26,170 --> 06:09:27,870
I don't think I can prevent that, though.

8560
06:09:28,370 --> 06:09:28,850
Like...

8561
06:09:29,470 --> 06:09:29,810
Unless...

8562
06:09:30,350 --> 06:09:30,590
Boom!

8563
06:09:31,730 --> 06:09:32,210
He...

8564
06:09:32,210 --> 06:09:33,490
Guys, he dodged it.

8565
06:09:33,990 --> 06:09:35,190
Guys, he...

8566
06:09:35,190 --> 06:09:37,910
He may or may not have dodged my...

8567
06:09:40,050 --> 06:09:41,490
My game crashed!

8568
06:10:09,090 --> 06:10:12,010
Guys, we're not finishing this game today.

8569
06:10:12,010 --> 06:10:40,020
That broke my... that... that... I think... I think... I think that was the sign that maybe today was not the day when we finished Dynasty Warriors.

8570
06:10:40,020 --> 06:10:46,760
And I think... I think that... that was the sign.

8571
06:10:47,720 --> 06:10:54,600
And that... I forgot that I'm not strong enough.

8572
06:10:55,280 --> 06:11:00,060
Because I have... because I need a practice for tomorrow.

8573
06:11:04,980 --> 06:11:09,860
Because I don't... I don't think we're finishing Dynasty Warriors.

8574
06:11:10,020 --> 06:11:10,560
Today.

8575
06:11:11,360 --> 06:11:12,280
I...

8576
06:11:14,720 --> 06:11:18,720
That... that... that was the sign for me.

8577
06:11:18,980 --> 06:11:24,780
I honestly... that... that was... that was the game telling me it's over.

8578
06:11:25,380 --> 06:11:28,620
That... that was the mess of me.

8579
06:11:28,620 --> 06:11:33,520
The game literally told me... that... I had to stop.

8580
06:11:34,140 --> 06:11:34,560
I...

8581
06:11:34,560 --> 06:11:36,380
Guys tell you to go here.

8582
06:11:36,760 --> 06:11:38,640
Looking forward to the next part.

8583
06:11:38,980 --> 06:11:40,260
Good luck in practice.

8584
06:11:40,500 --> 06:11:41,240
Solid Snake.

8585
06:11:41,540 --> 06:11:42,700
Thank you for the super chat.

8586
06:11:42,820 --> 06:11:43,100
Thank you.

8587
06:11:43,220 --> 06:11:43,780
Thank you.

8588
06:11:43,780 --> 06:11:44,340
Thank you.

8589
06:11:44,340 --> 06:11:46,900
So glad I made it your time for the beginning of the playthrough.

8590
06:11:47,220 --> 06:11:47,580
Truths.

8591
06:11:47,660 --> 06:11:48,860
Thank you for the super chat.

8592
06:11:49,020 --> 06:11:49,260
Thank you.

8593
06:11:49,420 --> 06:11:49,900
Thank you.

8594
06:11:50,280 --> 06:11:50,680
Deon.

8595
06:11:50,780 --> 06:11:51,780
Thank you for the super chat.

8596
06:11:51,900 --> 06:11:52,180
Thank you.

8597
06:11:52,260 --> 06:11:52,620
Thank you.

8598
06:11:52,700 --> 06:11:53,600
This is really funny.

8599
06:11:53,780 --> 06:11:54,740
But it's also technique.

8600
06:11:55,000 --> 06:11:58,220
Very EXP efficient to nuke a large force like you're doing.

8601
06:11:58,940 --> 06:12:01,180
And also the grind of spirit to the...

8602
06:12:01,820 --> 06:12:02,220
Guys...

8603
06:12:02,220 --> 06:12:03,980
This was my side.

8604
06:12:04,380 --> 06:12:05,280
That was like...

8605
06:12:05,280 --> 06:12:07,080
A message from the heavens.

8606
06:12:07,780 --> 06:12:08,340
Like...

8607
06:12:14,000 --> 06:12:15,200
Oh my God.

8608
06:12:15,560 --> 06:12:18,140
I don't think I'm strong enough right now.

8609
06:12:18,320 --> 06:12:18,920
After...

8610
06:12:18,920 --> 06:12:21,240
My entire motivation...

8611
06:12:21,240 --> 06:12:23,300
Was gone after that.

8612
06:12:23,980 --> 06:12:24,700
Alright.

8613
06:12:25,960 --> 06:12:27,380
Next week...

8614
06:12:27,380 --> 06:12:28,480
We will...

8615
06:12:28,480 --> 06:12:29,220
Finish...

8616
06:12:29,880 --> 06:12:31,660
We will finish...

8617
06:12:31,660 --> 06:12:33,300
Dynasty Warriors...

8618
06:12:33,300 --> 06:12:34,860
We will...

8619
06:12:34,860 --> 06:12:35,700
Finish...

8620
06:12:35,700 --> 06:12:37,040
Dynasty Warriors...

8621
06:12:37,040 --> 06:12:37,540
Next week.

8622
06:12:37,800 --> 06:12:40,300
It might have been a little clickbait today.

8623
06:12:40,660 --> 06:12:42,640
I did not expect...

8624
06:12:42,640 --> 06:12:43,200
The...

8625
06:12:43,200 --> 06:12:45,740
I did not expect the battle...

8626
06:12:45,740 --> 06:12:46,660
To be...

8627
06:12:49,540 --> 06:12:50,640
Oh my God.

8628
06:12:51,080 --> 06:12:52,240
To be...

8629
06:12:52,240 --> 06:12:53,400
That difficult.

8630
06:12:54,540 --> 06:12:55,340
Alright guys.

8631
06:12:56,180 --> 06:12:58,260
One more YouTube stream.

8632
06:12:58,660 --> 06:13:00,680
One more YouTube stream.

8633
06:13:00,680 --> 06:13:01,920
Anyway guys.

8634
06:13:02,160 --> 06:13:03,380
I'm gonna call it...

8635
06:13:03,380 --> 06:13:04,960
I have to practice...

8636
06:13:04,960 --> 06:13:05,140
Today.

8637
06:13:05,860 --> 06:13:07,020
As always...

8638
06:13:07,020 --> 06:13:08,080
Everybody...

8639
06:13:08,080 --> 06:13:09,100
Stay hydrated.

8640
06:13:09,800 --> 06:13:10,660
Posture check.

8641
06:13:11,120 --> 06:13:12,300
Get up and move around...

8642
06:13:12,300 --> 06:13:13,540
To get that blood flowing.

8643
06:13:13,700 --> 06:13:14,500
And if you...

8644
06:13:14,500 --> 06:13:15,720
Stay up for me...

8645
06:13:15,720 --> 06:13:16,660
Get to bed.

8646
06:13:16,860 --> 06:13:17,360
Cause...

8647
06:13:17,360 --> 06:13:18,360
You deserve it.

8648
06:13:18,500 --> 06:13:19,660
I might do like...

8649
06:13:19,660 --> 06:13:21,620
I might just do the mini stuff off stream.

8650
06:13:22,060 --> 06:13:22,950
Just cause like...

8651
06:13:22,950 --> 06:13:23,250
Like...

8652
06:13:23,250 --> 06:13:24,670
I don't wanna...

8653
06:13:25,290 --> 06:13:25,910
Spend...

8654
06:13:25,910 --> 06:13:27,450
The last stream...

8655
06:13:27,450 --> 06:13:27,810
Next week.

8656
06:13:28,130 --> 06:13:28,830
To like...

8657
06:13:28,830 --> 06:13:30,310
Do the whole grind again.

8658
06:13:30,690 --> 06:13:31,510
So like...

8659
06:13:31,510 --> 06:13:32,590
I might do that off...

8660
06:13:32,590 --> 06:13:33,370
I'm just gonna...

8661
06:13:33,370 --> 06:13:34,650
Do the mini areas.

8662
06:13:34,970 --> 06:13:36,030
Grind that off stream.

8663
06:13:36,170 --> 06:13:36,430
Don't worry.

8664
06:13:36,430 --> 06:13:38,430
I'll make sure I don't talk to anybody.

8665
06:13:38,850 --> 06:13:39,430
I'm just...

8666
06:13:39,430 --> 06:13:40,950
Gonna grind the weapons.

8667
06:13:41,270 --> 06:13:41,810
I'm just...

8668
06:13:41,810 --> 06:13:43,390
Gonna make sure the weapons...

8669
06:13:43,390 --> 06:13:44,710
Were strong enough.

8670
06:13:44,850 --> 06:13:46,310
And that I'm leveling up enough.

8671
06:13:47,470 --> 06:13:48,130
Hey guys.

8672
06:13:48,310 --> 06:13:49,610
I'll see you guys...

8673
06:13:49,610 --> 06:13:50,110
Tomorrow.

8674
06:13:50,630 --> 06:13:50,910
As...

8675
06:13:50,910 --> 06:13:51,710
Bye everyone.

8676
06:13:51,870 --> 06:13:52,490
Did I do my...

8677
06:13:52,490 --> 06:13:53,570
As always everybody stay hydrated.

8678
06:13:53,750 --> 06:13:54,170
Posture check.

8679
06:13:54,410 --> 06:13:55,070
Get up and move around.

8680
06:13:55,150 --> 06:13:56,010
To get that blood flowing.

8681
06:13:56,270 --> 06:13:56,970
If you stay up for me...

8682
06:13:56,970 --> 06:13:57,570
Head to bed.

8683
06:13:57,690 --> 06:13:58,070
Cause...

8684
06:13:58,070 --> 06:13:58,810
You deserve it.

8685
06:13:58,910 --> 06:13:59,950
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

8686
06:14:00,250 --> 06:14:00,550
Bye.

8687
06:14:00,550 --> 06:14:01,010
Bye guys.

8688
06:14:01,110 --> 06:14:01,810
Bye.
