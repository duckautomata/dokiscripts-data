532
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:52,060
Wait, wait, wait, I need to...

533
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:55,500
Let me put...

534
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:56,040
Let me see.

535
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:01,820
I need...

536
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:02,760
Oh, there we go.

537
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:04,740
There we go.

538
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,300
It needs to be a little smaller.

539
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:07,540
It was a little bit too big.

540
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,600
Is that big enough?

541
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:16,680
Yeah.

542
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:20,760
There you go.

543
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:27,300
A big, an above average size mic for an above average dog.

544
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:28,400
Whoa.

545
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:29,200
Let's do it.

546
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:29,820
You know what?

547
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:31,420
It's time.

548
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:32,860
It's time.

549
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:35,740
Sing a little something special for my babes.

550
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,200
Isn't that right?

551
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:44,610
All right.

552
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,910
Let's circle around.

553
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:57,670
sorry there you go all right i'll do it here on the table

554
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:11,040
i didn't plan for the the serenade part but i figured i just
you know i felt something today out here in the woods with

555
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,220
all you babes

556
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:24,100
that's right it just it was just so i was just so inspired
you know in the woods

557
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:40,600
let me see uh i know what to sing i don't i definitely don't
think i definitely think this spot is gonna get uh hit by

558
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:50,760
monetization and they're gonna take my ads but i know what
to sing for all my babes out there my babe goons out there

559
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:56,560
it's been a long time since I sang this song.

560
00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:11,830
I most likely only sing one part of this song because I only
remember one line.

561
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:15,410
Oh, wait.

562
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:20,710
Someone gave me a better idea and I'm going to steal it as
if I thought of that first.

563
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:28,290
I'm going to steal your idea now.

564
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:45,230
now that was a better idea than what i originally had
planned don't worry i got reverb all right i've never sang

565
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:48,630
this song before so let's try

Anyway.

577
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:27,500
That song was a lot longer than I thought.

578
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:31,380
Actually, a hundred.

579
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:35,500

He started to laugh.

749
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:28,620
He laughed for a while.

750
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:31,840
He said, come on, Duck, let's walk to the store.

751
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:34,800
I'll buy you some grapes so you won't have to ask anymore.

752
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:39,320
So they walked to the store and the man bought some grapes.

753
01:09:39,540 --> 01:09:43,280
He gave one to the duck and the duck said, Hmm, no thanks.

754
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:45,320
We know what sounds good.

755
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:48,460
We make my day.

756
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:58,000
You think this star, you think this star, you think this
star, has a need.

757
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:05,200
Lemonade, then he whirled away, whirled, whirled, whirled,
whirled, whirled, whirled

758
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:40,180
Yeah, actually, I should get wireless headphones honestly at
this point, I was like trying to turn around And then like

759
01:10:40,180 --> 01:10:46,680
my wires got caught up and everything and I was like, bro, I
should really get wireless headphones Or Doki should really

760
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:47,940
get wireless headphones

761
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:58,560
I was just like, fuck, how do I get, I actually took off my
headphones and just walked away.

762
01:11:02,580 --> 01:11:04,600
Let me, no more hat.

763
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:06,220
Hat, God.

764
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:11,380
I want you guys to look into my eyes, my beautiful eyes.

765
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:17,960
I actually wandered away.

766
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:20,060
To the very next day.

767
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:20,940
Bump bottom.

768
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:21,940
Bump bottom.

769
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:25,200
Wait, let's see if we...

770
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:27,060

771
01:11:28,700 --> 01:11:30,100
My very specialized.

772
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:33,340
That's crazy.

773
01:11:35,260 --> 01:11:37,820
Wait, there's no way they don't have it.

774
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:40,900

775
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:41,980

We actually really want to sing this song.

779
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:50,380

780
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:53,700

And then we'll go to the beach.

1139
01:42:56,300 --> 01:42:58,520

Oh, there it is.

1233
01:50:37,170 --> 01:50:38,630
It keeps disappearing.

1234
01:50:44,370 --> 01:50:45,210
Okay, wait.

1235
01:50:45,670 --> 01:50:49,870
I'm trying to get it closer to me, but I don't know where I
am.

1236
01:50:52,810 --> 01:50:54,470
Where am I?

1237
01:50:57,830 --> 01:50:59,510
Where the fuck am I?

1238
01:50:59,630 --> 01:51:00,610
Oh, that's a plane.

1239
01:51:00,690 --> 01:51:01,250
You guys see that?

1240
01:51:01,270 --> 01:51:03,550
That was a plane over there.

1241
01:51:03,690 --> 01:51:05,350
I flew above me.

1242
01:51:08,830 --> 01:51:15,890
But how can I celebrate my birthday if I don't have a cake
to celebrate it with?

1243
01:51:17,650 --> 01:51:17,830
Sad.

1244
01:51:19,590 --> 01:51:21,110
So sad.

1245
01:51:22,310 --> 01:51:24,750
I'm so sad now.

1246
01:51:25,950 --> 01:51:29,190
I guess I'll just attach it to my head.

1247
01:51:30,130 --> 01:51:30,430
Oh.

1248
01:51:31,270 --> 01:51:31,270
I

1249
01:51:37,730 --> 01:51:40,350
just wanted to be next to me.

1250
01:51:40,510 --> 01:51:43,530
It feels so weird having a whole cake here.

1251
01:51:50,380 --> 01:51:50,860
Whoa.

1252
01:51:54,160 --> 01:51:54,300
Regret.

1253
01:51:57,620 --> 01:51:58,920
Oh, there you go.

1254
01:52:00,180 --> 01:52:00,640
Yay.

1255
01:52:01,720 --> 01:52:03,840
Let's make a birthday wish.

1256
01:52:04,540 --> 01:52:06,140
Oh my gosh, if I can't fucking...

1257
01:52:06,140 --> 01:52:07,220
Okay, I'm grabbing a slice.

1258
01:52:07,780 --> 01:52:08,940
This cake is too big.

1259
01:52:11,100 --> 01:52:11,880
There you go.

1260
01:52:12,020 --> 01:52:13,580
A slice is easier to manage.

1261
01:52:15,420 --> 01:52:16,340
God, is it?

1262
01:52:18,860 --> 01:52:20,040
It's like a shield.

1263
01:52:20,520 --> 01:52:22,480
Oh, don't worry, my lady.

1264
01:52:22,900 --> 01:52:24,420
Stand behind me.

1265
01:52:26,380 --> 01:52:27,240
Oh, my God.

1266
01:52:28,160 --> 01:52:28,780
This is...

1267
01:52:28,780 --> 01:52:29,520
Oh, my God.

1268
01:52:29,580 --> 01:52:31,160
