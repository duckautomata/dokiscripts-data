1
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,840
Hello, everybody!

2
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,340
Hello, hello, guys!

3
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:50,780
Alright, yes!

4
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,920
Today is Minecraft Story Mode!

5
00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:00,380
I have been looking forward to playing this game for the longest time.

6
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,820
I thought, like, setting this up would be very difficult, because if you guys didn't know...

7
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:09,940
This game is a Telltale game.

8
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,980
For those who don't know what Telltale games are...

9
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:18,320
They used to be, like, a really... They used to be, like, a really popular game dev...

10
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,620
Game company?

11
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,620
Game development company?

12
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,500
For various franchises, their most successful one was The Walking Dead.

13
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:33,440
Which was very surprising, but, like... As in, like, it was very surprising, because in the end...

14
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,060
They went bankrupt, but they had a lot of IPs under them.

15
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,620
So they had Walking Dead, they had Batman, they had... What was it?

16
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,740
The Wolf Among Us?

17
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,540
They had, um...

18
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,020
They were gonna do Game of Thrones at one point as well.

19
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,720
They had Borderlands, they had, uh...

20
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,280
And then they had Minecraft!

21
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,000
There were so many other franchises.

22
00:02:54,580 --> 00:03:00,220
And of a lot of different types of... A lot of different IPs that they made.

23
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,580
And they had, like, a very specific way of doing their games.

24
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,460
And it was all, like, um... It was all basically, like, it was a narrative game where your choices matter.

25
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:14,140
So each choice you make, uh... Was gonna affect the next episode.

26
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,540
And then they announced they were going bankrupt!

27
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,720
And the entire company closed down!

28
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,820
And I was very shocked at that time, because...

29
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:25,420
It felt like they kept making really, um...

30
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,080
It kept... It felt like everybody was streaming it.

31
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,000
So, everybody... Not streaming it.

32
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:30,540
Sorry, I forgot.

33
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,440
It was, like, what?

34
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:31,840
2012?

35
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,160
Everyone was doing Let's Plays of it!

36
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,460
That was so surprising!

37
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,360
I was like...

38
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,620
How did they go bankrupt?

39
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,600
They literally...

40
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,280
Were gonna make a Game of Thrones, um... Telltale game.

41
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,760
Like, what happened?

42
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,260
Like, it surprised everybody, because everyone was making, like...

43
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,980
Let's Plays of the game, and, uh...

44
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,980
And, like, it seemed like it was really popular.

45
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,000
But apparently, I think they blamed...

46
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,760
They blamed the Let's Players, right?

47
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,480
I don't remember the full story.

48
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,740
But they were like...

49
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:11,000
Yeah, people love watching other people play it, but they weren't...

50
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,940
They weren't buying the game.

51
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,780
I think that was the argument.

52
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,600
They were like, nobody's buying the game.

53
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,480
Everyone's just watching Let's Players, which was true.

54
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,820
I can see it was... Yeah, I... I was just like...

55
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,080
I guess it's sort of true, because I didn't buy any of the game.

56
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,620
I... I was just like...

57
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:42,420
I mean, I guess it was sort of true, because, like, I was just watching Let's Plays of all...

58
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:45,880
Of the Walking Dead, like, Telltale games.

59
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,300
I wasn't playing that.

60
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,640
But I was also young, like...

61
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,580
I didn't have the fucking spending money to buy video games.

62
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:06,280
I'm playing free to play... I had... All I was doing was playing Gmod, because I only... I couldn't buy, like, a lot of games.

63
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,100
Dr. Cranberry, thank you for the super chat.

64
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:12,800
Thank you, thank you.

65
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,220
After 15 years of making adventure games, this was the game that bankrupted Telltale.

66
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,620
Thank you for the super chat.

67
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,540
Thank you, thank you.

68
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,200
Anyway...

69
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,320
The company's back, though.

70
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,880
I remember, like, someone said they got...

71
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,960
They, like, bought... Like, someone... A company bought them.

72
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:37,380
So, like, Telltale's technically back, but, like, they haven't been making any...

73
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:42,240
The games they've been making is not as good as they used to make, because people just...

74
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,960
People don't care about original games.

75
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,320
A lot of people don't really care about original games anymore.

76
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:51,000
It's more all about, like, using pre-existing IPs.

77
00:05:51,000 --> 00:06:07,220
I think that was... Honestly, like, Telltale's strongest suit was pre-existing IPs, because you can say The Wolf Among Us... I remember a lot of people were saying The Wolf Among Us was a really good Telltale game, but, like, I... More... People talk about...

78
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:12,140
People talk about The Walking Dead more than The Wolf Among Us.

79
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:19,820
Like, I... The only thing I know about The Wolf Among Us was the fact that the guy was really hot.

80
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,520
Like...

81
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:28,400
That's, like, the only thing I knew about that game.

82
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,740
But a lot more people were definitely playing The Walking Dead one instead of The Wolf Among Us.

83
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,640
Was The Wolf Among Us a pre-existing IP?

84
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,380
Oh my god, was it?

85
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,580
Oh my god, it was!

86
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,680
Wait, it was based on...

87
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,780
Oh, it was... Oh, I guess it was based off another IP.

88
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,960
I thought they made up that story.

89
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,320
I was like, what the fuck is this?

90
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:50,520
Yeah.

91
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:56,480
But, oh my god, even then, it was not a very well-known IP.

92
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,120
No, the newer... The newest games that they've been making...

93
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,500
What was it?

94
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,440
Okay, I know, like, they're back now.

95
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:15,440
Because I was thinking... They released the one about space, and I was, like, thinking about trying it out when it was released, but then, like, I was like... I saw the reviews, and I was like, never mind.

96
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,400
I... Okay, let's see.

97
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,860
New Telltale Games.

98
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,720
There is... Oh, The Expanse!

99
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,300
Yeah, The Expanse.

100
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,620
Was that... That one was... Yeah, that's a new IP.

101
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,280
Um, I heard about it.

102
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,260
I saw the reviews, it wasn't, like...

103
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:35,660
Um, like, I saw the Steam reviews when it first came out, and everyone was just like, eh, it's alright.

104
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,520
That was based on the show.

105
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,040
There's a show?!

106
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,820
Oh my god, am I... What?

107
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,180
What show is this?

108
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,720
That's an 8.5?

109
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:51,840
Okay, this is the thing about, like, a lot of shows now, especially those on streaming services.

110
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,880
Is this a... Okay, is this a streaming service show?

111
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,040
Okay, I need to make sure... Check.

112
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,480
Yeah, okay, for the Syfy Network.

113
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,340
So, like, this is my issue.

114
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:08,860
There's so many shows that apparently have really fucking good ratings, but, like, I've never heard of them before.

115
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,180
Like, I've... I've, like...

116
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:17,240
There's so many shows that are like that, where it's, like, they're like, oh my god, look at these...

117
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,240
Look at, like, the reviews for this show.

118
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,580
It has, like, an... Like, a blank out of 10.

119
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,380
Like, 8 out of 10, 9 out of 10.

120
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,680
And I'm like, what the fuck is this?

121
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,580
I've never heard of this show before.

122
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,260
There's just so many shows.

123
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,400
Uh, so many different shows.

124
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,440
Like, um...

125
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,780
I had several people that were trying to... That were recommending me The Reacher.

126
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,360
I was like, the fuck is The Reacher?

127
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,360
And then I looked it up.

128
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,040
It has an 8 out of 10 on IMDB.

129
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,060
And I was like, I've never heard of this show before.

130
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,720
There's, like, there's just too many at this point.

131
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,180
There's just so many.

132
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,220
Like, I had, like, three people that was like, oh, you should check out The Reacher if you like action.

133
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,140
And I was like, the fuck is that?

134
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,320
I was like, Reacher.

135
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,700
And I'm just like, I've never heard of this before.

136
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:09,960
I've actually, I've never... And then there's, like, there's apparently, there's a really... There's so many of them are also on Apple TV.

137
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,040
What I've noticed.

138
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:16,680
What I've noticed is that a lot of them are also on Apple TV.

139
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,060
Because, like, uh, what's it called?

140
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,380
There's one for Maya Rudolph.

141
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,500
That's apparently doing really well.

142
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,580
And then there's what?

143
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,200
What's... Oh my god, what is it?

144
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,740
The new Maya Rudolph.

145
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,040
A lot of them.

146
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:30,800
Loot, yeah.

147
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,660
How much... What's the reviews for that?

148
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:33,620
Loot.

149
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,080
That has... Oh, never mind.

150
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,040
It's a 74%.

151
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,480
I thought it was doing really well.

152
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,760
Maybe I'm confusing it with another Apple TV show.

153
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,920
There's apparently a lot of them.

154
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,780
There's a lot of them.

155
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,220
I'm definitely confusing them with a lot of...

156
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,840
There's so many shows I'm confusing them with.

157
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,560
Um, no, I've been watching Severance.

158
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,540
I love Severance.

159
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,160
I don't like Season 2, though.

160
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,060
Season 1 was great.

161
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,220
I loved Season 1.

162
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,940
Season 2, I was like, What the fuck is going on?

163
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,040
Super Bare Hero, welcome to Tomato Farm.

164
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:09,820
Welcome, welcome.

165
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,180
Season 2 of Severance, nothing made sense until...

166
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,420
Nothing still made sense.

167
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,080
When you watch the final episode, things started to make sense.

168
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,100
But nothing still made sense.

169
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,520
They introduced...

170
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,240
I'm not spoiling anything.

171
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,380
But they they introduced a lot of stuff.

172
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:48,180
Well, but it didn't I don't know what's going on It was I don't know maybe I'm just stupid but like I was so fucking confused in Season two it like a season one loved it season two.

173
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,660
I was just confused.

174
00:10:49,660 --> 00:11:07,320
Like I don't know what the fuck was going on Anyway, so telltale Had like a particular anyway back to talking about telltale they oh my god I like looked up their Wikipedia and I did not apparently they were gonna have stranger things They were gonna make a before,

175
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:30,500
you know before they went bankrupt because I guess they bought too many IPs cuz they were like We're never gonna die as a game company Everybody loves our games and then they went bankrupt But they were gonna have a stranger things game they're gonna have a game of thrones they were gonna have wait they have a Wait,

176
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,460
what the fuck?

177
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,300
They're gonna have a mr. Robot.

178
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,660
Oh my god.

179
00:11:34,720 --> 00:12:01,780
They had a mr. Robot game on on the phone Yeah, anyway, look at They're just like clearly lots of people are buying our video games Because look at how popular they are when let's players play them and then they forgot that we're just watching those let's players Cuz it's basically the same thing I Appreciate it really they all they did it already.

180
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:04,680
I don't even remember them doing Game of Thrones.

181
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,440
Oh my god It must be really bad.

182
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,940
I do not remember the episodes at all.

183
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,460
I also never watched Game of Thrones.

184
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:32,920
I like I've like I've only I watched the first couple of episodes of Game of Thrones and Um, and I just wasn't into it it was just alright for me There was just okay and then like there were so many sex scenes that felt like it was unnecessary

185
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:52,520
Just like I was like I was just like What's that need it felt like I had there were like in the first couple of episodes I felt like they were like one per episode at least one per episode.

186
00:12:52,620 --> 00:13:42,900
So then I was just like, okay I was just like, all right, look like if it advances the plot I get it, but I was just like it That's just so confused No, no, it's needed for the plot Turkey you don't understand What else were they so I remember like I complained about that to one of my friends and then my friend was like what else were they supposed to do back in the old times This was their hobby to pass the time it makes sense that that's they show that a lot because what else were they gonna do and then Just like and I'm just like yeah,

187
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,960
but like Hey, we could look at what the other kingdoms are doing.

188
00:13:48,220 --> 00:14:06,480
We don't have to show like how they're passing the time I'll stop talking about Game of Thrones Yeah, so they did Jurassic Park when the fuck did they do Jurassic Park 2011 there was law and order.

189
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:12,520
Oh my god, there was back to the future Okay, I did not realize there were a lot.

190
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,360
Oh my god There were so many duds.

191
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:24,140
I just I just realized how how they were They actually stretched themselves then they wait.

192
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,840
Yeah, I was like what?

193
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:46,700
Okay now I know why they went bankrupt guys Now I know There was no way they're making back that money They did a lot of stuff that I wasn't even aware of there was what the fuck was poker night I Like oh Oh, I remember this one.

194
00:14:46,780 --> 00:15:04,740
I remember this is when you play poker against like other IPs cuz they just had too many IPs at that Point I remember that one And then they just kept doing they just kept doing Walking dead because that was their cash cow Can you go think of this super chat?

195
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,140
Thank you.

196
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:05,600
Thank you.

197
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:10,860
Dookie now has to play all the games Airport and thinking was super chat.

198
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,140
Thank you.

199
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:11,580
Thank you.

200
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:18,320
The expanse is very good sci-fi, but not sure if it's really your thing Also, the last season really fell off when it was canceled Thank you.

201
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,300
I just think nope.

202
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:40,400
I just think like you're never gonna You're never gonna be satisfied with any finale Cuz like it's so hard to make a good ending for a show Cuz even if you think it's a good ending someone's gonna not like the ending and also it's hard to make endings for shows that are like beloved and stuff cuz you have to like Satisfy his fans,

203
00:15:40,500 --> 00:16:18,400
but you don't want to make it like a hat like a super duper happy ending cuz it's just incredibly cliche I Honestly can't on the top of my head Think of any show right now who's ending that actually liked I I don't I can't I can't even remember any I can't even remember any show that I've watched that actually liked the ending I Never watched Breaking Bad cuz I got too sad.

204
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:39,000
I was just like I was I tell you okay I always tell you guys this but for those who don't know I've never watched Breaking Bad Because like I usually try to avoid like super heavy Drama shows where like it's just like What's it called what's that word called where it's basically just trauma dumping the show

205
00:16:43,580 --> 00:17:20,240
It's just like I feel like Breaking Bad is like one of those categories where Yeah, I just you know, I just don't want to be sad and throughout the show like throughout the episodes and And so like but I don't want to be sad throughout it Anyway, anyway so I I got really depressed watching the very first episode of Breaking Bad and I watched a little bit of episode 2 and I just couldn't take it I was just like this is just way too sad.

206
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:23,560
Like I like oh, I like Bojack Horseman.

207
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:44,300
I wasn't The ending was okay, I would say Bojack Horseman's ending was okay I won't say it was the best ending but it wasn't a bad ending I didn't I what I didn't think I didn't think it was like a super great ending to the show That's an even saddest show,

208
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,140
but they're funny talking animals.

209
00:17:46,580 --> 00:18:00,840
It's like not as real Okay, okay, so this is my reasoning this is my reasoning like they're animated So like it like at least like, you know, when sad things are happening.

210
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:31,240
I'm like Funny talking horse at least he's a horse, you know But because I'm like, oh man, it's it's it's not actually real because they're just funny talking animals But like when but then I look at Breaking Bad and I'm like, oh this feels way too real like he has cancer Like It could happen to anybody look at him He's just a regular guy and then in Bojack Horseman.

211
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:44,740
I know like one of the producers in in this show Not the actual producer, but there's a character in the show that gets cancer, but then I'm like, but then like But he's not an animal, but I'm like, he's just animated.

212
00:18:44,880 --> 00:19:03,200
It's not real like his cancer I Like like I disabled the reality I make sure to separate it from reality because it's animated But when it's like IRL like when it's when it's like live-action, I can't separate it.

213
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,220
I'm like, oh my god He actually has cancer

214
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:21,100
Look that's that's how I like separate.

215
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,240
Um, I like I'm able to separate it between the two

216
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:34,120
Okay Cancer's fake because he's not real.

217
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,740
He's not he's animated.

218
00:19:35,860 --> 00:20:04,560
So I don't feel I mean I feel sad to the character But I don't feel as sad knowing that Walter White had cancer or has cancer So cuz I'm like, oh my god, he's so real But that's my that's how I separate it, uh, but yeah, I never watched Breaking Bad Because of it cuz I just got way too depressed watching it Anyway another funny story well,

219
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:30,720
it's not really a story but uh Um So I got reached out by like a sponsor to like the thing to like potential sponsor or something And it's really funny because they like they use CC instead of BCC So CC makes it so that I can see who else they reached out to and then BCC they've used BCC Extension I they get to you know,

220
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,620
they email several people or BBC.

221
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,340
Sorry BBC.

222
00:20:33,620 --> 00:21:04,140
I don't remember And you can you can send it the email to other people and but they won't be able to see who else they said it to so they use CC instead and the thing is I saw Who they reached out to and Sinatra was one of them and it's so funny because When my manager replied back They like deleted all the people that they added.

223
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,260
So it was me.

224
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,860
They emailed this to like four other people.

225
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,120
And Sinatra was like one of the people they emailed it to.

226
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,040
And my manager would reply back.

227
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:21,500
They deleted the extended thing and just replied back to the developer.

228
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:25,120
Sinatra as in the FPS player.

229
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,160
Like the Twitch streamer, Sinatra.

230
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,700
Not Frank Sinatra.

231
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,660
There is a Twitch streamer.

232
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,220
His name is Sinatra.

233
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:47,080
Anyway, so this funny thing is Sinatra's manager, who by the way is actually part of a big talent agency, replied all.

234
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,780
I was like bro.

235
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:59,280
They replied all and like gave their rates.

236
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:04,140
So I know how much they get paid for their sponsor.

237
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:07,260
I was like oh man, that's their...

238
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,600
I was like whoa, that's their rates.

239
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,280
I mean understandable because CCP is a lot.

240
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,680
But I was just like bro, why did you reply all?

241
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,580
I was like bro.

242
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,460
And they gave like...

243
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,540
I'm not gonna say it.

244
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,500
I'm not gonna say his...

245
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,760
I'm not gonna say what his rates are.

246
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:34,860
But I literally saw like how much he gets paid hourly technically by sponsors.

247
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,220
And I was like damn.

248
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,020
I'm not gonna say it guys.

249
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,420
Not even like if you buy my...

250
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,740
You can't buy this stylus.

251
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,760
I don't want to get in trouble.

252
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:53,360
I'm just letting it out there that hey, your manager sort of fucked up a little.

253
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,600
And thank you for the super chat.

254
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,820
Thank you, thank you Riverdale.

255
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,580
I never watched the ending of Riverdale.

256
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,060
I stopped after...

257
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:07,280
I stopped watching Riverdale because I didn't have time.

258
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,880
Because each episode is a fucking hour long.

259
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,360
I swear if I look away from watch...

260
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,480
If I look away for like five seconds if I'm watching Riverdale.

261
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,540
I would miss like 10 different plot points.

262
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,560
So I just never was able to finish it.

263
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,380
Because the last season...

264
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:33,260
The last season Riverdale I watched was when they got involved when Jughead went to a private school.

265
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,920
Because he got like a scholarship or something.

266
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,560
So Jughead went to a private school.

267
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,820
And then he joined like the writer's club or something.

268
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,020
And then the writer's club was apparently a fucking cult itself.

269
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,180
So and then the most fucked...

270
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,720
I remember talking about this before but it was so fucking stupid.

271
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:57,520
So the teacher slash head of the writer's club that oversees the writer's club.

272
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:04,900
The writers, the producers of Riverdale hated that actor.

273
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,040
So they just killed him off.

274
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:11,180
Like they just made him jump off the window and was like he's dead now.

275
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:16,180
But like there was no plot value.

276
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,640
They just hated the actor.

277
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:22,120
So they literally wrote him off because the actor pissed off the producers.

278
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,540
He just dies.

279
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,180
They just like wrote him off and he just dies.

280
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,100
And then they don't touch upon that anymore.

281
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:35,360
So like the whole plot story regarding the writer's club sort of like...

282
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,520
I don't know what the fuck happened.

283
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:43,200
Like it just got like brushed off because they're like the teacher's gone now.

284
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,680
Like how do you fix the plot?

285
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:45,680
You don't.

286
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,720
They just add 10 more plot points in there.

287
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,740
So it makes you forget.

288
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:52,460
They make you forget about the previous plot point.

289
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:58,060
And then just add like 10 more new plot points in there because then you'll be focused on that.

290
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,000
Anton, thank you for the super chat.

291
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:01,620
Thank you, thank you.

292
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:05,460
Please finish watching Riverdale and then explain it to us.

293
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,360
Thank you for the super chat.

294
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,520
Thank you, thank you.

295
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,640
I thought I was like incredibly interesting.

296
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:17,620
I was just like, wait, but like what happened to the writer's club plot point?

297
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,060
Like are we just gonna ignore that?

298
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,900
Like is it just gone now?

299
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:32,280
It felt like there was a lot of build-up to it, but I guess we just ignore it.

300
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,860
Anyway, but yeah, that was that story.

301
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,220
Hey guys, okay.

302
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,820
All right, we're gonna play.

303
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:46,100
Sorry, sorry, I rambled a lot today.

304
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,520
All right.

305
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,160
Anyway, today, Minecraft story mode.

306
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,700
I have no knowledge about...

307
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,300
We did a lot of yapping today.

308
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:04,040
But yes, I have no knowledge about this actual game itself except for one very important part.

309
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:09,160
Which is the most famous part that anyone outside of Minecraft knows about.

310
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,000
So that's like the only thing I know about Minecraft story mode.

311
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:18,340
But I had several friends DM me.

312
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:23,860
And were like, oh my god, I'm so excited for you to play Minecraft story mode.

313
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,960
It's such a good game.

314
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,440
And then, okay, not several.

315
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,080
I had one friend.

316
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,620
Sorry, I don't know why I lied about that.

317
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,800
Pretending I have lots of friends.

318
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,020
It was like a, it was a, what's it called?

319
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:42,040
It was like a, a fight or flight response.

320
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,940
Like natural reaction to pretend I have a lot of friends.

321
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,480
So people don't judge me.

322
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,220
But...

323
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,640
Too, too real.

324
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,360
Anyway, okay.

325
00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:04,560
Anyway, so I had one friend DM me about, DM me about how they were super excited.

326
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:08,180
And this friend of mine is a lot younger than me.

327
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:12,940
So I was just like, so I was like, wait a minute.

328
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,440
Well, I wouldn't say a lot younger.

329
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,060
I would say like, they are younger than me.

330
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:24,380
And then, so they were like, oh my god, I, I love, I love Minecraft story mode.

331
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:32,060
And I, and then I, and then, and then they were like, like, I would love, I would watch Minecraft story mode all the time.

332
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,080
And also watch XQC.

333
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:51,060
And then that like, explained enough about like, what they were like when they were like, I was just like, oh, okay.

334
00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:03,440
I was just like, okay, I, I, I sort of understand a little bit about this game now.

335
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:21,860
Anyway, let's try out Minecraft story mode.

336
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:32,460
So yes, this game, even when it went bankrupt, when Telltale went bankrupt, um, it got delisted in Minecraft, on the Minecraft store.

337
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:46,780
And there's no way to, the only way to legally own this game is to buy, um, buy an Xbox that already has it installed or buy like, the disc and stuff.

338
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,460
So like, buy the disc and everything.

339
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,460
And um, and yes, I managed to get this game working.

340
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,680
The game works.

341
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,480
That's all I'll say.

342
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,280
The game works.

343
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,600
All right, I'm super excited.

344
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,680
Okay, not now.

345
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:18,340
I don't think those servers are alive anymore.

346
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,320
All right, let's play it.

347
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,580
Okay, so this is gonna be...

348
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,720
Oh wait, isn't that Telltale?

349
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,600
That's him, right?

350
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,320
That's him!

351
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,500
That's that guy in those cutscenes!

352
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:31,740
That's him, right?

353
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:32,440
Default man?

354
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:33,600
Yeah?

355
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,860
Oh yeah, that's me!

356
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:39,940
That's him!

357
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:40,820
That's my guy!

358
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:43,440
All right, the Order of the Stones.

359
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,040
All right, this game series...

360
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,100
Okay, so it's all about the choices I make.

361
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,160
Let me know about the sound, guys.

362
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,140
There's no...

363
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:01,120
There's no subtitles, I think.

364
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,080
All right, let me boost the volume up a little bit.

365
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,380
Oh, there are?

366
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,320
Okay, I'll...

367
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:26,280
I'll...

368
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:30,200
I'll up it a little bit more and then we'll look into the subtitles.

369
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,520
This voice acting is so familiar.

370
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,500
Oh my god, look at him go!

371
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,900
He's so strong!

372
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,100
Jack Blacksleeve will remember that.

373
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:10,500
He apparently was supposed to voice act the fucking pig in Minecraft.

374
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,480
Look at the super chat.

375
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,160
Uh, actual.

376
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,060
Thank you, thank you.

377
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:21,980
These four friends together would give so much to gain their rightful place as four heroes.

378
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,100
They don't have a medic.

379
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,640
Who the fuck is gonna heal them?

380
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:30,800
To fight a mysterious creature known as the Ender Dragon.

381
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,040
But where the fuck is their support?

382
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:38,720
The Order of the Stone emerged victorious and the dragon was defeated.

383
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:43,880
Their story complete, they slipped away into the pages of legend.

384
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:54,070
But when one story ends, another one begins.

385
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:05,330
Would you rather fight a hundred chicken-sized zombies or ten zombie-sized chickens?

386
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:10,570
Yeah, just to be clear, you wouldn't have any weapons or armor.

387
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:13,270
Oh shit, uh, chicken-sized zombies.

388
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:15,830
I'll take the, uh, the little tiny...

389
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,750
Oh wait, no, they're like so tiny!

390
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:18,490
A hundred of them.

391
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:21,310
I forgot it's the chicken jockey!

392
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:22,610
Oh my god!

393
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:23,710
They're so strong!

394
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:25,570
The baby zombies!

395
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:27,650
I forgot baby zombies are incredibly strong.

396
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:33,770
I forgot about it.

397
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:36,390
Chicken jockey.

398
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:48,210
Oh my god, there's him!

399
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:49,230
There's Reuben!

400
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:56,630
Can't wait to fall in love with this character and nothing bad is gonna happen to Reuben.

401
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:59,070
Reuben's my best friend.

402
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,190
I love Reuben.

403
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:05,650
I'm already so attached, guys.

404
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:16,170
Yeah, embrace it.

405
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:18,030
We're never gonna change.

406
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:21,610
Yeah, that's right, Olivia.

407
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:22,670
You're a loser!

408
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,610
You know what he sounds like?

409
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:30,990
He sounds like Patton Oswalt.

410
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:31,810
What's his name?

411
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,190
Patton Oswalt?

412
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:35,430
Is that his actor's name?

413
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:37,730
Wait, but the sun's out.

414
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:42,750
Is that Patton?

415
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,190
That's Patton Oswalt?

416
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:47,670
I think that's Patton Oswalt, the voice act!

417
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:50,070
In Minecraft?

418
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:54,910
I just don't say anything.

419
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:03,690
Oh my god, Brad and Tui himself!

420
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:06,870
Wait, can I...

421
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:10,490
Okay, audio-visual.

422
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:11,530
Oh, there it is.

423
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:13,930
Okay, let's get medium because we need that.

424
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:14,830
All right.

425
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:19,730
There we go.

426
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:24,010
Oh my god, wait.

427
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,390
Are we actual losers?

428
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:29,110
Looks awesome.

429
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:30,250
Wait.

430
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:36,730
Yes.

431
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:42,290
Oh my god, we're nerds!

432
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:52,090
Okay.

433
00:34:58,530 --> 00:34:59,330
What do I do?

434
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,650
Oh my god, I'm playing the game!

435
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:01,130
Oh!

436
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:03,830
Okay, what do I...

437
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:04,490
What do I...

438
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:05,170
What do I grab?

439
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:09,250
What's wrong with that?

440
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:10,650
I'll see you guys at the lockers.

441
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:17,290
Wait, they're still alive?

442
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:19,190
How many years has it been?

443
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:24,550
Yeah, that's right, loser.

444
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:26,050
You definitely will.

445
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:33,470
Why the fuck would I need shears and some sheep?

446
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:37,150
Get the pumpkin!

447
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:38,590
Shake the pumpkin!

448
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:47,090
And when we do, people will look at us and say...

449
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:48,910
Hey, there goes Jesse and Ruben.

450
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:51,110
Winners of the Endercon building competition.

451
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:51,850
That's me!

452
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:53,350
Really should change the name.

453
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:55,850
Okay.

454
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:58,410
Oh, bring up a really small amount?

455
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:00,670
Okay, let me adjust the audio real fast.

456
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:04,330
Um, maybe I'll turn the music down a little bit too.

457
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:07,130
I put it large because I can't see very...

458
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:13,330
Okay, let's see.

459
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:17,370
I'm also like lounging back because I know I don't have to actually play the game.

460
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:22,330
Oh man, I love Telltale Games.

461
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:24,190
I love Telltale Games.

462
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:24,670
I'm not...

463
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:27,090
This is me playing.

464
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:34,550
Okay,

465
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:38,650
nice.

466
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:39,210
All right.

467
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:41,430
We're good to go?

468
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:44,350
Okay.

469
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:45,390
Bye.

470
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:46,930
Come on, Ruben.

471
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,350
Pigs don't take fall damage, right?

472
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:50,270
Just chuck him down.

473
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,060
Okay.

474
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:12,360
Oh!

475
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,480
Spot!

476
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:16,980
Oh!

477
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,000
Gabriel the Warrior?

478
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,860
How many diamonds did they pay him?

479
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,180
I'd love to meet Gabriel.

480
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,320
I'm his number one fan.

481
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:37,280
Totally.

482
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,300
He's awesome.

483
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,240
It'd be amazing to meet him.

484
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:43,780
Of course.

485
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,480
Didn't end well.

486
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,780
Is that how Ruben dies?

487
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,980
Gabriel Keynote sold out.

488
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:07,180
Wait, they already met?

489
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,240
They already sold out?

490
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,620
What's wrong with that?

491
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:13,500
Yeah!

492
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,340
Anything can happen.

493
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,040
Then why have we lost nine of these in a row?

494
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,240
You can't...

495
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,340
No, you can't look at this as...

496
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,480
Look, a thousand people signed up.

497
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,120
It's not my fault.

498
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,960
Maybe no one else will show up.

499
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,380
Now you're being realistic.

500
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,060
Wait a minute.

501
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:32,440
Wait a minute.

502
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,040
We're thinking about this all wrong.

503
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:37,800
The point of the building competition isn't just to build something.

504
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,920
We have to do something to get noticed by the judges.

505
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:41,780
Okay, then.

506
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,000
So how do we do this?

507
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:43,640
The PP blocks.

508
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,900
We don't just build something functional.

509
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,800
We build something fun.

510
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,440
The PP towers.

511
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,440
After we finish the fireworks machine like we planned.

512
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,160
Surely the judges will notice that.

513
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,160
And we build something cool on top of it.

514
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,720
We might be on to something.

515
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:57,260
The PP tower and then we put a white wall block.

516
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,580
That's what the shears are for!

517
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,280
That's what they're for!

518
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,040
I'm so sorry.

519
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,980
They both have their moments.

520
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,500
Both pretty scary.

521
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,280
Then again, you scared the crap out of us.

522
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,000
What else will we do with the shears?

523
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:13,980
Wait, let's build a creeper.

524
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,120
Oh yeah, let's build a creeper!

525
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,780
Yeah, what's wrong with a creeper?

526
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,440
Oh my God, you're right!

527
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,740
The creeper is...

528
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,720
Thank you for the super chat.

529
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,060
Thank you, thank you, El.

530
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,760
Derek, no.

531
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,100
That's the same thing.

532
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:46,580
Forget it.

533
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,280
Team on three.

534
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,840
One, two, three.

535
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:50,400
Team!

536
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:55,260
I can't believe they got Patton Oswalt to voice act.

537
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,900
No wonder Telltale went bankrupt.

538
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:58,320
Like, how many...

539
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,480
Wait, oh shit.

540
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:00,680
Oh shit.

541
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:01,740
I gotta...

542
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,380
Wait, what happens if I fail this though?

543
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,260
Oh, sorry, Reuben.

544
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,840
Wait, how do I...

545
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,600
Wait, how do I...

546
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,360
I can't!

547
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,020
I can't do push-ups!

548
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,600
Look at me go!

549
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,260
Getting that sand!

550
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,820
Oh my God, I'm doing it!

551
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:21,820
I'm getting better!

552
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:25,000
Oh, I pressed W!

553
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,040
Go, Reuben!

554
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:27,860
Look at me go!

555
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,140
Let's go!

556
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,400
Also, I brightened it up a little bit.

557
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,620
Oh my God, I'm gonna beat up some plants.

558
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,540
The hardest structure in this game.

559
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,160
Like, how?

560
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,240
How?

561
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:40,520
How?

562
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:45,000
No exercise for me.

563
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:46,560
Oh my God.

564
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,320
The creeper has no white...

565
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:49,840
White wool.

566
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,320
It's fine.

567
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,320
Oh, I'm so fucking strong.

568
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,080
Oh, is it arrow keys?

569
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,420
Okay, that actually makes sense.

570
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,540
Let's go, team!

571
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,320
Let's go!

572
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:31,720
Okay, but they do have a cooler pet, guys.

573
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,520
Hey, I'm a really cool pig, okay?

574
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:52,330
Bet they won't build anything cooler than me.

575
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:58,830
We've done this like...

576
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:00,390
We've done this for like nine times.

577
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:01,990
So, can we just reuse our names?

578
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:05,190
We're the Order of the Pigs.

579
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,570
We're the Order of the Pigs.

580
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:12,650
It's so fucking cool.

581
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:16,790
We're so cool.

582
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:19,670
Look,

583
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:27,030
it might not...

584
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:31,950
It might not be as cool as the Ocelot, but it's still pretty fucking cool.

585
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:34,790
How do I use my inventory item?

586
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:36,350
Okay, I'm booth five, right?

587
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:39,410
Uh, is there anything in the chest?

588
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:40,590
Hello?

589
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:47,170
Look, I already said we're losers, so we might as well, like, commit to it.

590
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:49,690
It's all about the character development.

591
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:51,030
We're staying in character.

592
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:53,710
Wait, there's not even that many people here.

593
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:55,650
How did I lose six times in a row?

594
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:57,790
Oh my god, this is like...

595
00:42:58,590 --> 00:42:59,310
These camera...

596
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:00,350
Wait, we're booth four, right?

597
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:04,510
Okay, no, they're booth four.

598
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:06,590
We're booth five.

599
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:08,030
Okay, give me a sec, guys.

600
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:09,850
I'm here for a character development.

601
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:12,230
I'll be back soon, guys.

602
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:14,950
I'm here to look at the competition.

603
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:17,790
How did I lose nine times in a row?

604
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:19,250
There's five teams!

605
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:21,290
Did we never improve?

606
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:27,610
So, Takeda, thank you for the super chat.

607
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:28,610
Thank you, thank you.

608
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:31,250
Still cooler than the order of the dog dorks.

609
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:33,790
Getting lost in the nether, hunting the Ender Dragon.

610
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:34,970
Thank you for the super chat.

611
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:35,910
Thank you, thank you.

612
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:41,030
Okay, clearly, someone in our team has to be replaced.

613
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:44,950
There's no way we lost nine times in a row when there's five teams.

614
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:53,510
Wait, there's no way!

615
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:55,570
They went into creative mode!

616
00:43:57,590 --> 00:43:58,250
How the fuck?

617
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:02,670
Wait!

618
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:08,890
Our design is so much cooler.

619
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:12,310
Okay, maybe I need to be replaced.

620
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:15,110
Their difficulty score is going to be higher than our total score.

621
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:15,750
How the fuck?

622
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:17,230
I didn't kill a winner!

623
00:44:18,310 --> 00:44:18,790
Fireworks.

624
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:21,090
We should probably stop staring.

625
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:21,590
There's no way!

626
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:22,610
Look at their gear!

627
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:26,810
Look, it's the order of the losers again.

628
00:44:27,850 --> 00:44:29,030
Good one, Gil.

629
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:30,890
We're just looking.

630
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:35,890
There'll be plenty of time for you all to look at it after it wins and gets shown at Endercon.

631
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:37,490
You're being unpleasant.

632
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:39,170
Maybe not all of you.

633
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:41,950
Endercon doesn't allow outside food or drink.

634
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:43,070
What?!

635
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:44,490
He's my pet!

636
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:46,790
Reuben is not food!

637
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:48,330
Reuben is not food.

638
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:49,130
Could have fooled me.

639
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:50,830
He looks delicious.

640
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:52,230
What the fuck?

641
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:54,370
That sounded like a weird compliment.

642
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:56,870
You'll have to eat me first.

643
00:44:58,150 --> 00:44:59,750
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.

644
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:01,590
Stop wasting your time, Aiden.

645
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:02,950
We've got work to do.

646
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:04,930
How the fuck did he get a beacon?

647
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:06,650
You're lucky I'm busy.

648
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:10,610
Apparently, there's like Minecraft voice actors in here.

649
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:11,550
How's the build going?

650
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:14,970
Only time will tell, but we're optimistic.

651
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:15,870
Hey, Petra.

652
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:18,210
I forgot to thank you for that nether star.

653
00:45:18,890 --> 00:45:19,850
Nether star?

654
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:21,310
How can I help these tools?

655
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:24,270
For the right price, I'll help anyone.

656
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:26,950
If you need anything, you know where to find me.

657
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:28,370
Do you take IOUs?

658
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:31,710
None of us know- Okay, let's fix the audio one last time.

659
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:33,550
All right, let's see.

660
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:34,950
Uh, what was it?

661
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:38,470
Okay, turn down music by one more and then...

662
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:39,550
There we go.

663
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,150
And then we raise it up one last time.

664
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:42,810
How the fuck?

665
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:45,110
No wonder we're losing all the time.

666
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:47,590
They got like a fucking...

667
00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:48,490
They got everything.

668
00:45:49,810 --> 00:45:50,210
All right.

669
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:52,590
Apply.

670
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:54,030
All right, let me know if it's better.

671
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:54,830
Sound guy.

672
00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:55,630
...to find you.

673
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:56,770
Exactly.

674
00:45:57,930 --> 00:45:59,230
No hard feelings, guys.

675
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:01,730
If you're cool with Petra, you're cool with us.

676
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:04,770
Is it cuz- So why don't we just forget about all this?

677
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:07,930
And, you know, make this about how cool our builds are.

678
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:11,530
No, we're gonna fucking crush you.

679
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:13,650
I don't care.

680
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:16,330
I don't know if you know this, but we're pretty good.

681
00:46:17,830 --> 00:46:18,710
Oh, wait.

682
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:19,730
I get it.

683
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:21,410
It's like a joke, right?

684
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:22,490
This is war now!

685
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:23,070
No, I'm serious.

686
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:24,010
We're gonna destroy you.

687
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:27,630
You know, you're really funny.

688
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:29,010
That's awesome.

689
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:30,490
Hey, good luck.

690
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:33,910
That's right.

691
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:34,550
This is it.

692
00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:35,770
The 10th time.

693
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:38,770
Like they say, 10 times the...

694
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:39,830
I don't know.

695
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:41,030
10 times the way?

696
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:49,230
Gabriel!

697
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:50,590
Gabriel!

698
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:51,970
Gabriel!

699
00:46:51,970 --> 00:46:52,250
No!

700
00:46:58,230 --> 00:47:01,510
Okay, handshakes are pretty cringe, though.

701
00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:06,110
The warrior...

702
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:09,750
Wait, I want to know what the redstone rap is.

703
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:12,190
Rap for me, please, Patton Oswalt.

704
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:14,670
Rap for me.

705
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:28,020
I was promised a rap.

706
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,240
What is this?

707
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:33,820
That was it.

708
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:34,900
They literally...

709
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:36,940
The whole premise is a rap.

710
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:39,400
They didn't even say anything.

711
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:43,640
Am I...

712
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:44,300
Am I building?

713
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:45,320
Oh, shit.

714
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:47,720
Okay, I actually want to win, though.

715
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,060
No, we're gonna fucking win.

716
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:57,220
I'm locking in, guys.

717
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,490
There's no way I could build this any faster, like...

718
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:05,620
Oh my...

719
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:08,160
I'm like using my wooden keyboard and everything, too.

720
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,100
Oh, everybody's so slow.

721
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:14,200
We're so fucking fast.

722
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:20,370
Did I do it?

723
00:48:20,550 --> 00:48:21,210
I just...

724
00:48:21,210 --> 00:48:21,750
Is that it?

725
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:24,930
I just built it like that?

726
00:48:27,450 --> 00:48:28,610
Wait, it's 2D.

727
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:30,270
Oh, man.

728
00:48:30,350 --> 00:48:31,690
That looks so cool.

729
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:33,110
We'll win this for sure.

730
00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:36,270
The Creeper was definitely the right way to go.

731
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:37,770
Why is it 2D?

732
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:41,650
Yeah, I didn't even cover it.

733
00:48:41,730 --> 00:48:42,150
This is...

734
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:43,590
Guys, people are looking at us.

735
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:44,670
This is actually sad.

736
00:48:44,870 --> 00:48:46,090
Good build, man.

737
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:47,550
That's it?

738
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:49,190
No way.

739
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:52,210
It's just a bunch of died wolves.

740
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:54,870
Whoops.

741
00:48:54,970 --> 00:48:55,130
Oh!

742
00:48:56,910 --> 00:48:57,390
Ruben!

743
00:48:57,790 --> 00:48:58,070
Oh, no!

744
00:48:58,130 --> 00:48:59,130
Ruben's on fire!

745
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:00,690
Ruben, no!

746
00:49:00,830 --> 00:49:01,470
Come back!

747
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:04,070
The lava's getting closer.

748
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:04,990
It'll ruin the build.

749
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:07,150
Ruben's going to get lost.

750
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:07,810
Quick!

751
00:49:08,190 --> 00:49:09,430
Anyone have a bucket?

752
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:10,310
We've got to do something.

753
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:11,650
But our build is...

754
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:12,630
Save the machine!

755
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:15,010
The machine is more important!

756
00:49:15,610 --> 00:49:16,990
We've got to cover Jesse.

757
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:17,730
Be careful.

758
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:19,690
Save it!

759
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:20,670
It's more important!

760
00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:22,990
We don't care about Ruben for now!

761
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:29,810
I'm just fucking...

762
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:31,070
It's saved.

763
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:31,650
We did it.

764
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:34,690
But it took three seconds!

765
00:49:35,330 --> 00:49:37,150
They could have come with me!

766
00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:39,110
Ruben, where are you?

767
00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:41,250
It took them three seconds!

768
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:44,910
Look, we lost nine times in a row, we have...

769
00:49:44,910 --> 00:49:46,890
We lost nine times in a row, guys.

770
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:48,390
We can find Ruben later.

771
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:52,650
That was it!

772
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:54,690
They placed five bugs!

773
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:56,110
They could have come over!

774
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:08,340
Okay, well, obviously, those are Ruben's footprints, right?

775
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:09,760
Ruben!

776
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:10,580
Where are you, buddy?

777
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:11,600
Ruben!

778
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:14,540
God damn it!

779
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,140
Ruben, I don't want to be out here in the dark!

780
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:20,040
Come on, Ruben!

781
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:24,240
Alright.

782
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:28,180
These definitely belong to a pig.

783
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,140
Hmm, there's no way Ruben made these on his own.

784
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,240
Wait, that's not Ruben's footprints?

785
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:37,400
Doesn't he have hooves?

786
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,040
Okay, let's grab a carrot, though.

787
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:41,480
Let's pick that out.

788
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:42,440
Ruben loves carrots.

789
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:47,060
Ruben!

790
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:50,680
Ruben!

791
00:50:56,370 --> 00:50:58,310
One of you has to be Ruben, right?

792
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:01,470
Did you take your clothes off, Ruben?

793
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:03,670
Wait, I can...

794
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:07,230
Ruben!

795
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:10,110
Are you Ruben?

796
00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:15,030
They all look the same!

797
00:51:15,470 --> 00:51:17,650
How do I know which one's Ruben?

798
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:23,130
Ruben, are you behind a tree?

799
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:27,650
Oh, he was not behind the tree.

800
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:32,800
Can I use this?

801
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:34,200
How do I use my items?

802
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:36,460
Oh, chicken!

803
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,300
Ruben, I have carrots, Ruben!

804
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:51,860
Jason?

805
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:53,740
Jason!

806
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:58,840
Okay, but can I burn trees?

807
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,140
Oh, smoldering costume?

808
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:00,580
What?

809
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,220
What is this?

810
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:08,700
Oh!

811
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:10,660
That's like...

812
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:11,580
See, I knew it!

813
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:12,560
He's naked!

814
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:17,830
Jason!

815
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:19,950
Jason!

816
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:28,260
Hello?

817
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:29,740
Ruben, are you in here?

818
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,380
There's a torch in here.

819
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:34,120
Someone's...

820
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:35,360
Oh, it's that woman!

821
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:37,880
It's that lady that farms stuff.

822
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:43,220
Ruben!

823
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:48,360
It's okay, I have a wooden sword.

824
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:51,440
Wait, how do I use my items?

825
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:53,700
Is there a way to use it?

826
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:57,880
I don't know how to use it, so I guess I'll die.

827
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:03,190
Ruben?

828
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:14,460
Clearly, it's not a creeper, right?

829
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:15,380
Or a zombie?

830
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:20,220
Ruben!

831
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:23,120
Ruben, there you are!

832
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:28,560
Oh, you have mu- you have big eyebrows!

833
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:31,320
Okay, now I know how you look different from the other piggies.

834
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:33,560
You're in big trouble.

835
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:35,700
That's right, Ruben!

836
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:39,160
You better remember that!

837
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:43,260
Tough love!

838
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:48,280
I got raised up by tough love and I turned out great!

839
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:55,060
He could have stopped, dropped, and rolled!

840
00:53:58,560 --> 00:53:59,480
I think we're good.

841
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:00,540
Oh, shit!

842
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:06,180
I think we made it!

843
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:06,960
Oh!

844
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:09,440
Oh, shit!

845
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:12,960
There's no way I would have died.

846
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,940
Wait, what happened if I would die?

847
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:17,720
What happens?

848
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:21,680
That's right!

849
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:24,220
Hit me.

850
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,320
Can I actually die?

851
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:27,980
Well, I'm curious.

852
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:30,780
Oh!

853
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:31,100
What happens?

854
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:35,500
That's it?

855
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:36,660
Oh, I died.

856
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:43,780
I'm just curious.

857
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:46,080
Did I just turn into the smoke?

858
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:48,640
Alright, don't worry.

859
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:49,400
I got this.

860
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:51,060
Get back!

861
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,920
Be gone, zombie!

862
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:56,100
Oh!

863
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:57,200
Oh!

864
00:54:58,560 --> 00:54:59,200
Oh, shit!

865
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:00,680
Look at that quick time event!

866
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:02,020
God, I'm such a gamer.

867
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:06,790
Okay.

868
00:55:07,770 --> 00:55:08,610
That's right, Reuben!

869
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:09,450
Are you watching, Reuben?

870
00:55:10,490 --> 00:55:11,670
Reuben, are you watching?

871
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:14,310
Jesus!

872
00:55:14,450 --> 00:55:16,470
Okay, okay, okay, guys!

873
00:55:16,670 --> 00:55:18,230
How close are you?

874
00:55:20,030 --> 00:55:20,950
Oh, shit!

875
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:24,090
What is the hitbox?

876
00:55:27,610 --> 00:55:29,030
Stupid wooden sword!

877
00:55:30,350 --> 00:55:30,790
What?

878
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:35,370
Reuben, stop watching!

879
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:40,490
I know it's bad.

880
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:41,310
I'll think of something.

881
00:55:41,530 --> 00:55:42,030
Okay, Reuben.

882
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:44,550
Maybe I shouldn't.

883
00:55:45,790 --> 00:55:46,630
Don't worry!

884
00:55:46,790 --> 00:55:48,190
We'll die together, Reuben.

885
00:55:48,190 --> 00:55:49,010
Too many of them, buddy!

886
00:55:50,370 --> 00:55:52,130
I'll leave that spot no matter what.

887
00:55:52,370 --> 00:55:52,730
Do you hear me?

888
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:53,650
Don't worry, Reuben.

889
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:57,830
If we're gonna die, I want us to die together like the Egyptians.

890
00:55:58,450 --> 00:55:59,490
Get away from him!

891
00:56:02,050 --> 00:56:03,990
Oh no, he got you!

892
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:05,690
It's okay, Reuben!

893
00:56:06,190 --> 00:56:08,470
I'll just feed you some carrots, right?

894
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:09,610
You'll be fine!

895
00:56:11,970 --> 00:56:14,230
So much for protecting!

896
00:56:14,470 --> 00:56:15,030
Get off me!

897
00:56:17,050 --> 00:56:17,810
Don't worry.

898
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:19,570
I got this.

899
00:56:21,070 --> 00:56:22,230
Get out of here!

900
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:29,950
It's okay, I'll give myself a black eye too.

901
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:30,790
He's so little mad.

902
00:56:31,870 --> 00:56:33,070
Where did Reuben go?

903
00:56:33,270 --> 00:56:34,250
Come on, let's get out of the open.

904
00:56:37,850 --> 00:56:38,850
Reuben, are you okay?

905
00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:43,830
It wasn't my fault, guys.

906
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:46,310
I was being a really good owner.

907
00:56:47,190 --> 00:56:48,110
I want to show you something.

908
00:56:48,490 --> 00:56:50,010
He's gonna turn into spider pig!

909
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:52,990
Not that this isn't a really cool dimly lit tunnel, but...

910
00:56:53,530 --> 00:56:55,590
How far away is this thing you want to show me?

911
00:56:58,110 --> 00:56:58,870
Careful, Jesse.

912
00:56:58,870 --> 00:57:01,330
You don't want to get a reputation as a wimp.

913
00:57:01,930 --> 00:57:04,470
This isn't my first time in a cave, Petra.

914
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:07,850
Yeah, but have you ever seen a wither skull?

915
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:10,230
Fresh from the nether.

916
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:13,170
You're the first person I've showed it to.

917
00:57:13,550 --> 00:57:14,790
You went to the nether?

918
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:16,770
You better appreciate this.

919
00:57:17,110 --> 00:57:19,590
You risked your life for that dusty old skull?

920
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,210
No, I risked my life for the thing I'm gonna exchange for that dusty old skull.

921
00:57:22,210 --> 00:57:24,730
Guys, Reuben tripped and fell down the stairs, guys.

922
00:57:25,910 --> 00:57:26,810
There's this guy I'm meeting up with.

923
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:27,730
He was just so clumsy.

924
00:57:28,370 --> 00:57:30,170
He's gonna trade me a diamond for it.

925
00:57:31,330 --> 00:57:33,430
Being the resident go-getter pays off every once in a while.

926
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:34,730
Wait, that's worth a diamond?

927
00:57:35,570 --> 00:57:37,790
Is a wither skull worth that much?

928
00:57:38,310 --> 00:57:39,330
Are you kidding?

929
00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:43,490
For all the trouble I had to go to get it, I should be asking for much more.

930
00:57:43,590 --> 00:57:44,970
A single diamond.

931
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:46,110
What?

932
00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:49,750
You could have farmed those diamonds yourselves.

933
00:57:50,130 --> 00:57:51,350
You killed a wither skeleton.

934
00:57:52,790 --> 00:57:56,070
I mean, I did build a super cool statue, but still.

935
00:57:56,550 --> 00:57:58,090
It's pretty sweet being you, huh?

936
00:58:00,930 --> 00:58:03,230
You know, you could come with me.

937
00:58:03,670 --> 00:58:04,050
Me?

938
00:58:04,370 --> 00:58:07,150
You think I'm cool and hot and like...

939
00:58:07,930 --> 00:58:09,010
So brave?

940
00:58:09,290 --> 00:58:10,490
All that you just said?

941
00:58:12,330 --> 00:58:13,290
I'm all in.

942
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:15,870
You had me at female.

943
00:58:16,270 --> 00:58:18,470
Consider it my charitable act for the day.

944
00:58:19,050 --> 00:58:22,570
I'll consider it whatever you want me to consider it, as long as I get to come.

945
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:27,110
Keep the crafting table down there.

946
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:28,050
I'm like 10 right now.

947
00:58:33,870 --> 00:58:34,390
Guys,

948
00:58:38,830 --> 00:58:39,530
how do I make a sword?

949
00:58:40,310 --> 00:58:44,050
Guys, I don't remember the crafting recipe.

950
00:58:48,930 --> 00:58:51,210
Guys, what's the crafting recipe, guys?

951
00:58:54,850 --> 00:59:00,070
Guys, I always have the fucking... the crafting book to my...

952
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:02,010
I always have the recipe book, guys.

953
00:59:02,090 --> 00:59:02,570
Oh, fuck.

954
00:59:17,970 --> 00:59:19,350
Is that a sword?

955
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:20,550
Oh, I did it!

956
00:59:20,670 --> 00:59:21,570
I did it!

957
00:59:22,570 --> 00:59:23,990
I'm so smart.

958
00:59:24,350 --> 00:59:27,570
I knew it.

959
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:31,680
Look at that.

960
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:33,620
I'm a Minecraft-y.

961
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:35,020
I'm such a gamer.

962
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:42,300
Did we do it?

963
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:44,600
Wait, how do we know?

964
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:45,500
Good for you, Jesse.

965
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:52,860
Look at that.

966
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:53,360
See, guys?

967
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:54,480
I told you guys.

968
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:56,760
I told you we're winners.

969
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:03,720
No, he's an enabler.

970
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:07,940
He's got a buddy in his group just because he wanted to win.

971
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:11,200
Not a chance.

972
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:14,040
No, I can't tell her!

973
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:15,260
I'm not jealous or anything.

974
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:18,740
She's talking so much about Luka and I'm not jealous or anything.

975
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:25,640
And honestly, though, how did the fucking 2D creeper win?

976
01:00:34,290 --> 01:00:34,970
Wait, what?

977
01:00:35,110 --> 01:00:35,910
Those were torches!

978
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:40,790
They were torches, though!

979
01:00:41,690 --> 01:00:43,150
Jump in the water!

980
01:00:45,190 --> 01:00:46,410
There's no fall damage!

981
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:49,330
Oh, man.

982
01:00:51,770 --> 01:00:52,330
We jump!

983
01:01:03,950 --> 01:01:06,290
Oh my gosh, I finished a tutorial.

984
01:01:09,090 --> 01:01:10,870
I look so fucking cool.

985
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:18,800
How would I fight?

986
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:19,800
But I'm a coward.

987
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:21,660
The thing is, I'm a coward.

988
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:25,280
Oh wait, hello there.

989
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:33,560
Goodbye, chickens.

990
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:37,100
Yay, free meat!

991
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:39,460
Wait, how the fuck did they live?

992
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:46,510
Oh my god, there's the bats!

993
01:01:49,830 --> 01:01:50,510
Slap.

994
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:55,530
Thank you for the super chat.

995
01:01:55,650 --> 01:01:56,570
Thank you, thank you.

996
01:02:05,050 --> 01:02:06,070
My room.

997
01:02:06,830 --> 01:02:09,670
We're fucking glitched out there.

998
01:02:15,770 --> 01:02:18,790
I need you to let me do the talking, okay?

999
01:02:19,650 --> 01:02:23,110
I just don't want anything to screw this up.

1000
01:02:23,950 --> 01:02:25,510
I'll keep quiet, don't worry.

1001
01:02:25,550 --> 01:02:27,170
I'll let you handle it.

1002
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:36,450
I'm less scared of you than scared for you.

1003
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:50,090
We ran into each other while I was looking for Reuben.

1004
01:02:52,090 --> 01:02:53,350
He fell down a couple of stairs.

1005
01:02:55,550 --> 01:02:57,370
He was just being clumsy.

1006
01:02:57,770 --> 01:02:58,270
Right, Reuben?

1007
01:03:10,790 --> 01:03:12,710
It's okay, winning was much more important.

1008
01:03:16,070 --> 01:03:19,230
Why did it took- I could've covered it!

1009
01:03:19,330 --> 01:03:21,110
We had so much time!

1010
01:03:21,810 --> 01:03:24,330
Why did you not make it 3D?

1011
01:03:25,270 --> 01:03:27,350
Okay, we deserve a party, though.

1012
01:03:31,870 --> 01:03:33,530
I wanna party.

1013
01:03:33,930 --> 01:03:37,570
Also, like, the timing to make these choices is, like, instant.

1014
01:03:38,070 --> 01:03:43,170
I remember the Walking Dead, you had, like, an entire 30 fucking seconds to decide what to do.

1015
01:03:43,170 --> 01:03:45,730
And those were, like, life-death situations.

1016
01:03:55,910 --> 01:03:58,670
Oh shit, oh my gosh, shady deal in the alleyway.

1017
01:03:59,050 --> 01:04:01,010
For one singular diamond.

1018
01:04:09,390 --> 01:04:11,290
The very creepy alley.

1019
01:04:14,870 --> 01:04:15,550
Hmm...

1020
01:04:16,310 --> 01:04:17,810
A best character?

1021
01:04:25,950 --> 01:04:26,630
Wait...

1022
01:04:27,170 --> 01:04:29,370
Don't leave me here, I'm not scared or anything.

1023
01:04:41,910 --> 01:04:42,590
Wait...

1024
01:04:42,590 --> 01:04:46,070
Wait, I'm not scared or anything, but, like, this is my first deal.

1025
01:04:46,510 --> 01:04:47,430
Wait, a chest.

1026
01:04:49,430 --> 01:04:50,190
What's in here?

1027
01:04:52,170 --> 01:04:52,650
Hello?

1028
01:04:58,730 --> 01:05:00,270
Don't... No, who are you?

1029
01:05:00,390 --> 01:05:01,310
Uno reverso.

1030
01:05:12,590 --> 01:05:13,790
I'm her bodyguard.

1031
01:05:15,690 --> 01:05:18,050
You want a wither skull.

1032
01:05:26,410 --> 01:05:28,890
You're the one that's screaming!

1033
01:05:32,230 --> 01:05:34,890
Of course I have it, I lied naturally.

1034
01:05:42,850 --> 01:05:44,850
You bet I wanna see it.

1035
01:05:53,170 --> 01:05:54,290
Sam, please...

1036
01:05:54,290 --> 01:05:56,370
He met first!

1037
01:05:59,790 --> 01:06:04,110
Like, what kind of... Why is there some weird tense yes performance anxiety?

1038
01:06:14,550 --> 01:06:16,150
Who are these people?

1039
01:06:17,530 --> 01:06:18,710
What do you mean by those people?

1040
01:06:23,390 --> 01:06:27,130
I'm cool if he's cool.

1041
01:06:33,110 --> 01:06:36,490
Yeah, as long as he doesn't fuck with the vibe, I'm cool.

1042
01:06:37,090 --> 01:06:38,710
I'm here to do the legal shit.

1043
01:06:43,150 --> 01:06:44,650
Oh, is it just in that chest?

1044
01:06:46,110 --> 01:06:49,650
I don't like how, like... Why is it not payment first?

1045
01:06:49,810 --> 01:06:51,330
It should always be payment first.

1046
01:06:53,110 --> 01:06:53,950
What is it?

1047
01:06:56,230 --> 01:06:57,710
He fucked us over!

1048
01:06:59,470 --> 01:07:00,850
He can't get away with this!

1049
01:07:02,950 --> 01:07:04,170
Yeah, chase him!

1050
01:07:05,310 --> 01:07:06,810
He can't go so far, he's old!

1051
01:07:13,610 --> 01:07:14,610
Where is he?

1052
01:07:16,690 --> 01:07:20,770
Oh, he's wearing a mask, I bet.

1053
01:07:24,410 --> 01:07:25,510
Okay, I can do this.

1054
01:07:25,550 --> 01:07:26,410
I can do this fast.

1055
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:28,890
He has to be wearing a mask or something.

1056
01:07:32,530 --> 01:07:32,990
Hello?

1057
01:07:37,870 --> 01:07:40,090
Totally not here for anything illegal.

1058
01:07:41,470 --> 01:07:43,230
Oh my god, Gabriel!

1059
01:07:46,490 --> 01:07:48,450
Wait, I want her to go talk to Gabriel, though.

1060
01:07:49,130 --> 01:07:49,810
It's okay.

1061
01:07:50,530 --> 01:07:51,170
She'll understand.

1062
01:07:52,190 --> 01:07:53,390
She'll understand, guys.

1063
01:07:56,630 --> 01:07:57,650
Oh my god, my Oshie.

1064
01:07:59,570 --> 01:08:00,590
She'll understand.

1065
01:08:00,690 --> 01:08:02,210
She'll understand I got a little distracted.

1066
01:08:02,770 --> 01:08:04,450
Oh, it's Lucas!

1067
01:08:10,090 --> 01:08:10,930
What's up with you?

1068
01:08:14,710 --> 01:08:16,430
He has no biggie.

1069
01:08:16,970 --> 01:08:17,990
Just like, you know.

1070
01:08:18,170 --> 01:08:19,630
Didn't try that hard.

1071
01:08:26,250 --> 01:08:28,090
Your friend hurt my pig!

1072
01:08:40,810 --> 01:08:45,670
Hey, you didn't happen to see a creepy guy with long hair and a beard roaming around, did you?

1073
01:08:47,810 --> 01:08:49,810
You won't remember it.

1074
01:08:59,910 --> 01:09:00,390
No,

1075
01:09:04,110 --> 01:09:04,510
we're not!

1076
01:09:04,670 --> 01:09:06,530
Why do I get a choice to say no?

1077
01:09:07,330 --> 01:09:09,670
Coolio, too cool, cool beards!

1078
01:09:09,830 --> 01:09:11,250
I'm not gonna say anything.

1079
01:09:12,430 --> 01:09:13,970
What the fuck?

1080
01:09:14,270 --> 01:09:17,570
I can't say no, but I can say cool beards?

1081
01:09:17,850 --> 01:09:19,190
Let's fucking go.

1082
01:09:20,230 --> 01:09:22,470
Super cool beards.

1083
01:09:26,490 --> 01:09:27,530
What the fuck is this?

1084
01:09:27,550 --> 01:09:28,810
This is a chicken fighting ring?

1085
01:09:31,890 --> 01:09:33,770
What am I watching?

1086
01:09:33,770 --> 01:09:35,830
What are they watching?

1087
01:09:38,770 --> 01:09:42,190
The one-sided rivalry keeps going on.

1088
01:09:48,690 --> 01:09:49,970
Why?

1089
01:09:51,710 --> 01:09:52,450
Why?

1090
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:00,770
Okay.

1091
01:10:02,410 --> 01:10:04,550
Okay, we can't find him alone, though.

1092
01:10:05,610 --> 01:10:06,090
No.

1093
01:10:13,610 --> 01:10:20,410
Oh my god, this is a chicken fighting ring.

1094
01:10:20,650 --> 01:10:21,130
Illegal.

1095
01:10:22,630 --> 01:10:23,910
Wait, which one is it?

1096
01:10:24,910 --> 01:10:26,950
I legitimately don't even remember what shirt he was wearing.

1097
01:10:28,510 --> 01:10:29,470
Hello, weirdo?

1098
01:10:31,890 --> 01:10:32,570
Oh!

1099
01:10:32,570 --> 01:10:35,470
How is this fuckhead?

1100
01:10:37,010 --> 01:10:38,170
Move, you idiot!

1101
01:10:43,150 --> 01:10:44,310
Yeah, that's right.

1102
01:10:44,410 --> 01:10:45,550
I'm here to start a fight.

1103
01:10:46,530 --> 01:10:47,210
Yeah!

1104
01:10:49,270 --> 01:10:51,890
Get the fuck away from me, you whore.

1105
01:10:53,050 --> 01:10:57,830
Nobody likes you, and you are definitely compensating for something.

1106
01:11:01,550 --> 01:11:01,990
Oh!

1107
01:11:02,950 --> 01:11:03,390
That's right.

1108
01:11:03,810 --> 01:11:04,350
Oh shit!

1109
01:11:04,490 --> 01:11:05,850
Guys, I'm not a creep, I'm sorry.

1110
01:11:06,870 --> 01:11:08,270
I thought you were a man.

1111
01:11:09,290 --> 01:11:13,530
Which would not help my case a lot, but if you don't understand, I got scammed.

1112
01:11:17,490 --> 01:11:18,170
Wait, fine.

1113
01:11:18,270 --> 01:11:19,370
Reuben's fine, right?

1114
01:11:20,330 --> 01:11:22,670
I bet he's- Oh, I have to interact with him.

1115
01:11:27,470 --> 01:11:28,470
Wait, is that Reuben?

1116
01:11:29,470 --> 01:11:30,190
Oh shit!

1117
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:31,570
Oh wait, that was Reuben!

1118
01:11:39,510 --> 01:11:41,310
How did you take my pig?

1119
01:11:43,050 --> 01:11:44,170
Yeah, he's Chet.

1120
01:11:46,030 --> 01:11:47,490
Give him to me now.

1121
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:53,450
Yeah, what are you gonna do?

1122
01:12:01,090 --> 01:12:07,570
What the fuck, you just picked up a random- I'm a friend with a sword.

1123
01:12:09,530 --> 01:12:10,530
That's right.

1124
01:12:12,770 --> 01:12:14,870
Violence is always the answer.

1125
01:12:18,010 --> 01:12:19,710
Yeah, that's fucking right.

1126
01:12:19,910 --> 01:12:22,750
My stone sword, that's very scary.

1127
01:12:32,050 --> 01:12:34,650
Guys, Reuben didn't remember that, so I'm in the clear.

1128
01:12:36,950 --> 01:12:41,270
Guys, he didn't remember it, guys, so he doesn't care.

1129
01:12:41,850 --> 01:12:42,750
He's fine.

1130
01:12:45,450 --> 01:12:48,090
Yeah, but he didn't remember it.

1131
01:12:59,470 --> 01:13:00,430
Any sign of him?

1132
01:13:02,110 --> 01:13:05,230
Oh, there he is!

1133
01:13:05,430 --> 01:13:06,470
I see him.

1134
01:13:10,650 --> 01:13:12,910
Wait, how the fuck did he get past?

1135
01:13:15,470 --> 01:13:17,710
What would it take to get us inside tonight?

1136
01:13:23,310 --> 01:13:24,510
What about pig?

1137
01:13:26,270 --> 01:13:27,810
Get out of our way!

1138
01:13:27,810 --> 01:13:29,230
I'm violent!

1139
01:13:32,450 --> 01:13:33,110
What are you gonna do?

1140
01:13:33,150 --> 01:13:34,370
You're one person.

1141
01:13:37,990 --> 01:13:38,810
What the fuck?

1142
01:13:40,130 --> 01:13:42,490
Who the fuck hired this guy?

1143
01:13:50,150 --> 01:13:52,150
Okay, we need to distract him.

1144
01:13:52,610 --> 01:13:55,030
Oh, we just hit the wall.

1145
01:14:01,550 --> 01:14:04,390
Well, they must have been an incredibly cheap usher.

1146
01:14:16,850 --> 01:14:18,390
It's not no-bill zone.

1147
01:14:18,630 --> 01:14:18,990
Wait,

1148
01:14:22,130 --> 01:14:24,970
I wanna- Okay, but I wanna burn some chickens real quick though.

1149
01:14:26,210 --> 01:14:26,770
Is that alright?

1150
01:14:26,770 --> 01:14:28,250
With you, buddy?

1151
01:14:30,290 --> 01:14:31,030
Oh, I can?

1152
01:14:31,650 --> 01:14:32,010
No!

1153
01:14:36,590 --> 01:14:37,790
The chicken man.

1154
01:14:39,050 --> 01:14:40,830
He's really, really into chicken.

1155
01:14:40,990 --> 01:14:42,850
Well, obviously I need to grab the slime block.

1156
01:14:45,230 --> 01:14:46,630
Get out of the way!

1157
01:14:46,890 --> 01:14:48,010
I need the slime block.

1158
01:14:50,030 --> 01:14:50,510
Hmm...

1159
01:14:50,510 --> 01:14:52,850
I bet I could reach that glass with a slime block.

1160
01:14:55,490 --> 01:14:57,290
Give me the slime block right now!

1161
01:14:58,810 --> 01:15:00,970
Oh, hey, we meet again.

1162
01:15:03,530 --> 01:15:04,990
One slime block, please.

1163
01:15:05,510 --> 01:15:07,070
We don't give out slime blocks here.

1164
01:15:07,370 --> 01:15:08,530
Just slime balls.

1165
01:15:08,850 --> 01:15:09,310
The fuck?

1166
01:15:09,770 --> 01:15:13,150
We've got a limited supply today and we're only giving out two per customer.

1167
01:15:13,670 --> 01:15:14,290
How many do I need?

1168
01:15:14,570 --> 01:15:16,890
You could craft your own slime block if you had nine slime balls.

1169
01:15:16,890 --> 01:15:17,970
I need slime.

1170
01:15:19,130 --> 01:15:20,730
Don't ask questions!

1171
01:15:23,410 --> 01:15:25,430
There's no time to explain.

1172
01:15:34,630 --> 01:15:37,690
What if I just break that guy's block?

1173
01:15:39,810 --> 01:15:40,510
Wait, what?

1174
01:15:43,630 --> 01:15:44,850
Where do I get the ninth?

1175
01:15:45,630 --> 01:15:46,650
Oh, this guy!

1176
01:15:47,530 --> 01:15:47,790
Lucas!

1177
01:15:48,290 --> 01:15:49,210
I need that slime!

1178
01:16:01,050 --> 01:16:01,670
Thanks, Lucas.

1179
01:16:10,670 --> 01:16:12,290
How do I make that?

1180
01:16:13,110 --> 01:16:14,290
You've got good chemistry.

1181
01:16:14,770 --> 01:16:15,730
Do I just put it like that?

1182
01:16:15,870 --> 01:16:16,490
Three, six...

1183
01:16:16,490 --> 01:16:19,390
I'm just saying, I think it's cool you have a team that works so well together.

1184
01:16:19,970 --> 01:16:21,250
You're totally jealous.

1185
01:16:21,890 --> 01:16:22,830
How's it going, Jesse?

1186
01:16:23,070 --> 01:16:24,370
You know how to do this.

1187
01:16:24,710 --> 01:16:25,650
Is this a slime block?

1188
01:16:25,910 --> 01:16:26,830
Oh, I did it!

1189
01:16:27,090 --> 01:16:27,490
Ta-da!

1190
01:16:27,730 --> 01:16:29,110
One slime block.

1191
01:16:30,530 --> 01:16:30,970
Gross.

1192
01:16:31,290 --> 01:16:31,990
I'll take that.

1193
01:16:34,150 --> 01:16:35,030
Right... there.

1194
01:16:36,270 --> 01:16:37,530
It's all you, Jesse.

1195
01:16:37,910 --> 01:16:38,730
Give me a boost.

1196
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:44,400
Oh my god, look at that go.

1197
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:45,120
Parkour!

1198
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:50,920
It's crafting time.

1199
01:16:52,020 --> 01:16:53,840
And then I'm going to craft over this place.

1200
01:16:55,260 --> 01:16:56,620
Oh shit!

1201
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:57,820
Look at that.

1202
01:16:58,200 --> 01:16:58,880
Parkour.

1203
01:17:02,820 --> 01:17:03,500
Freedom!

1204
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:07,940
Freedom!

1205
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:16,340
Why did he run into the chickens?

1206
01:17:23,860 --> 01:17:24,580
Freedom!

1207
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:32,440
Wait, what?

1208
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:34,540
How would you know?

1209
01:17:34,620 --> 01:17:36,060
It's just an open door.

1210
01:17:36,220 --> 01:17:38,220
Anybody could open that door.

1211
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:41,260
What is he going to do?

1212
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:47,840
We're going to show him to not piss off us 12 year olds.

1213
01:17:49,780 --> 01:17:52,240
Like, how old are we in this game?

1214
01:17:57,890 --> 01:17:58,670
That's right.

1215
01:17:59,190 --> 01:18:01,270
We are a gang of 12 year olds.

1216
01:18:19,390 --> 01:18:20,490
Wait, we're not thieves?

1217
01:18:25,170 --> 01:18:26,430
Oh, that's so true.

1218
01:18:27,990 --> 01:18:28,710
I do.

1219
01:18:34,090 --> 01:18:34,650
Yeah!

1220
01:18:34,650 --> 01:18:35,210
Anarchy!

1221
01:18:38,350 --> 01:18:38,910
Exactly!

1222
01:18:40,350 --> 01:18:42,750
Why do we have to be a good tool of criminal?

1223
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:44,790
Right, Lucas?

1224
01:18:47,650 --> 01:18:49,690
I know you'd believe in me.

1225
01:18:50,670 --> 01:18:51,850
Alright, I'm going to steal bookcases.

1226
01:18:53,750 --> 01:18:56,010
It's very hard to make a crafting table.

1227
01:18:56,230 --> 01:18:58,010
Not crafting, uh, enchanted table.

1228
01:18:59,290 --> 01:19:00,170
Alright, what are you stealing?

1229
01:19:01,890 --> 01:19:03,950
See, I knew you were into stealing.

1230
01:19:06,070 --> 01:19:07,470
Wait, is that a diamond sword?

1231
01:19:07,470 --> 01:19:07,590
Is that a sword?

1232
01:19:11,110 --> 01:19:13,350
What sword is that?

1233
01:19:14,990 --> 01:19:15,730
Is that gold?

1234
01:19:32,110 --> 01:19:34,530
A sword is a sword.

1235
01:19:34,530 --> 01:19:36,810
Is there anything else I can steal?

1236
01:19:38,300 --> 01:19:39,450
What did you get, Axel?

1237
01:19:42,850 --> 01:19:45,850
You mean the water potion?

1238
01:19:46,810 --> 01:19:48,790
One of them just looks like water.

1239
01:19:49,470 --> 01:19:51,130
Oh, I'm stealing this.

1240
01:19:55,650 --> 01:19:57,510
What is that potion?

1241
01:19:59,630 --> 01:20:00,470
That's mine.

1242
01:20:01,650 --> 01:20:02,570
Get out of here.

1243
01:20:03,050 --> 01:20:05,730
I had the idea first.

1244
01:20:17,250 --> 01:20:18,770
There's no way he'll know.

1245
01:20:19,990 --> 01:20:21,370
Wait, what are you stealing, Olivia?

1246
01:20:26,770 --> 01:20:28,970
Oh, that's why he needs the Wither Skull, right?

1247
01:20:29,370 --> 01:20:29,970
To enchant.

1248
01:20:30,030 --> 01:20:31,390
Oh, Reuben, are you okay?

1249
01:20:35,170 --> 01:20:37,050
Where are you gonna steal?

1250
01:20:39,870 --> 01:20:40,770
What's that?

1251
01:20:43,510 --> 01:20:44,630
Oh, the lever.

1252
01:20:44,770 --> 01:20:48,950
I mean, I was gonna push the lever anyway.

1253
01:20:59,410 --> 01:21:00,970
Lucas, don't be a nerd.

1254
01:21:01,130 --> 01:21:01,990
Steal something.

1255
01:21:02,130 --> 01:21:03,390
We're all doing it.

1256
01:21:05,330 --> 01:21:06,950
We're all in this together.

1257
01:21:07,850 --> 01:21:09,010
Okay, let's pull this lever.

1258
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:15,380
Whoa, what's that?

1259
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:19,000
Oh, isn't that the Power Stone or whatever?

1260
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,580
Oh, it's a config.

1261
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,660
Oh my god, we're hacking in.

1262
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:27,560
Oh my god, it's a config block.

1263
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:30,700
It's like a bad block.

1264
01:21:32,460 --> 01:21:33,600
It's a machine.

1265
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:42,920
Time to put it in creative mode.

1266
01:21:47,940 --> 01:21:49,380
I'm here to hack now.

1267
01:21:52,740 --> 01:21:55,720
What the hell?

1268
01:21:59,180 --> 01:22:01,720
Yeah, it was...

1269
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:05,860
Maybe he's a collector?

1270
01:22:09,580 --> 01:22:12,400
You make banners?

1271
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:24,780
That's...

1272
01:22:28,980 --> 01:22:32,840
Oh, but what happens if you add the command block?

1273
01:22:39,260 --> 01:22:42,080
Wait, but what happens with a command block?

1274
01:22:44,300 --> 01:22:45,220
Okay, hide in the chest.

1275
01:22:45,300 --> 01:22:46,520
There's no way he'll find me.

1276
01:22:50,510 --> 01:22:52,170
Why did we not grab...

1277
01:22:54,510 --> 01:22:55,070
Wait.

1278
01:22:57,490 --> 01:22:58,050
Oh,

1279
01:23:04,070 --> 01:23:05,810
he wants revenge on Gabriel.

1280
01:23:06,870 --> 01:23:08,450
Wait, isn't he the wizard?

1281
01:23:09,490 --> 01:23:10,390
He's the wizard.

1282
01:23:13,750 --> 01:23:14,870
That's him.

1283
01:23:22,150 --> 01:23:22,990
That's him.

1284
01:23:23,110 --> 01:23:24,450
Why did he not get famous?

1285
01:23:24,570 --> 01:23:25,870
Is it because he's a fucking creep?

1286
01:23:35,530 --> 01:23:40,070
Must be like some fucking creep if he didn't get famous like everybody else.

1287
01:23:42,730 --> 01:23:44,630
I say nothing.

1288
01:23:49,170 --> 01:23:50,890
Goodbye, Olivia.

1289
01:23:54,630 --> 01:23:56,790
Leave her alone!

1290
01:24:00,050 --> 01:24:00,930
Yeah!

1291
01:24:00,930 --> 01:24:01,810
Yeah!

1292
01:24:07,030 --> 01:24:07,510
What?

1293
01:24:08,810 --> 01:24:10,450
She wouldn't remember it.

1294
01:24:10,490 --> 01:24:12,290
Why did no one else do it?

1295
01:24:13,630 --> 01:24:16,030
You have been voted off the island, Olivia.

1296
01:24:18,970 --> 01:24:20,130
Give me my diamond.

1297
01:24:20,230 --> 01:24:21,190
I don't care about the wizard.

1298
01:24:26,430 --> 01:24:30,750
Look, she's dead weight anyway.

1299
01:24:30,870 --> 01:24:31,530
She got Kai.

1300
01:24:35,510 --> 01:24:36,070
Enough!

1301
01:24:36,970 --> 01:24:39,130
You've wasted too much of my time already.

1302
01:24:43,220 --> 01:24:44,200
Where'd he go?

1303
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:46,280
Wait, what?

1304
01:24:48,540 --> 01:24:49,980
Just a snowman.

1305
01:24:51,140 --> 01:24:52,620
Am I gonna be afraid?

1306
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:53,440
Oh, what?

1307
01:24:53,580 --> 01:24:54,260
Oh, never mind.

1308
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:56,240
I forgot that's Iron Golem.

1309
01:24:56,420 --> 01:24:57,780
That's the Iron Golem recipe.

1310
01:25:00,260 --> 01:25:02,020
That's snow blocks, right guys?

1311
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:04,620
Forget!

1312
01:25:05,980 --> 01:25:07,220
What happens if I get smacked?

1313
01:25:07,340 --> 01:25:08,180
Oh, I'm okay.

1314
01:25:08,620 --> 01:25:09,660
I didn't even get hit!

1315
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:11,780
It's fine.

1316
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:13,300
We got you, Ruben.

1317
01:25:20,510 --> 01:25:23,230
A very buff snowman.

1318
01:25:29,250 --> 01:25:31,030
Yeah, we just stacked two blocks.

1319
01:25:36,670 --> 01:25:37,770
Ooh, Gabriel!

1320
01:25:38,450 --> 01:25:39,150
Gabriel!

1321
01:25:39,790 --> 01:25:40,370
Gabriel!

1322
01:25:44,650 --> 01:25:46,830
It was a really buff snowman.

1323
01:25:49,670 --> 01:25:50,990
I don't need Gabriel!

1324
01:25:51,610 --> 01:25:51,870
Woo!

1325
01:25:57,550 --> 01:26:01,470
Should we warn Gabriel of the creepy guy that wanted to kill him?

1326
01:26:01,530 --> 01:26:03,070
Nah, it'll be fine.

1327
01:26:08,070 --> 01:26:09,790
He's still down there.

1328
01:26:29,870 --> 01:26:31,070
Don't worry!

1329
01:26:31,330 --> 01:26:32,830
I shall be a hero!

1330
01:26:33,990 --> 01:26:35,690
We don't need Gabriel!

1331
01:26:37,390 --> 01:26:39,650
I'll be the next Gabriel!

1332
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:42,750
I'm a hero.

1333
01:26:49,990 --> 01:26:50,690
That's right.

1334
01:26:50,870 --> 01:26:51,950
I'm gonna be a fucking hero.

1335
01:26:52,110 --> 01:26:52,590
Watch this.

1336
01:26:52,710 --> 01:26:53,790
Ruben, what the fuck are you doing here?

1337
01:26:54,010 --> 01:26:54,230
Leave.

1338
01:26:54,230 --> 01:26:57,090
Move over.

1339
01:26:57,490 --> 01:26:58,310
That's right.

1340
01:26:58,390 --> 01:27:00,010
Oh, she right there.

1341
01:27:03,230 --> 01:27:07,770
That is exactly why I'm not letting Gabriel take all of my credit.

1342
01:27:10,950 --> 01:27:12,650
Can I die from the Iron Golem?

1343
01:27:15,530 --> 01:27:17,570
Oh, X-Spread Dog, thank you for the super chat.

1344
01:27:17,730 --> 01:27:18,690
Thank you, thank you.

1345
01:27:26,130 --> 01:27:27,550
Get out of here!

1346
01:27:31,670 --> 01:27:33,190
Just need to build three blocks.

1347
01:27:37,670 --> 01:27:39,610
What's he gonna do, kill me?

1348
01:27:41,050 --> 01:27:42,470
Slap me again!

1349
01:27:48,910 --> 01:27:50,070
Don't die!

1350
01:27:51,070 --> 01:27:52,590
Other than the time I did die.

1351
01:27:57,030 --> 01:27:59,070
I'm going to attack him.

1352
01:28:00,890 --> 01:28:02,030
Watch this.

1353
01:28:03,670 --> 01:28:04,930
Tell my story.

1354
01:28:09,170 --> 01:28:10,330
I'm just gonna do it.

1355
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:17,080
Yeah, that's right.

1356
01:28:17,180 --> 01:28:18,320
Look, look at me.

1357
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:20,140
Look at me.

1358
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:21,020
I'm looking.

1359
01:28:21,420 --> 01:28:22,960
Look at me, I'm right here.

1360
01:28:23,380 --> 01:28:24,140
Turn around!

1361
01:28:27,100 --> 01:28:28,340
Look at me!

1362
01:28:32,540 --> 01:28:34,480
I'm right here, look at me!

1363
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:38,660
Oh shit, I was supposed to look there.

1364
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:41,400
That's what I do.

1365
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:46,500
That's right, fuck you!

1366
01:28:53,180 --> 01:28:54,460
That's fucking right.

1367
01:28:54,460 --> 01:28:54,580
Okay.

1368
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:57,400
Yeah!

1369
01:28:59,020 --> 01:29:00,640
That's right, hit me again!

1370
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:06,900
Huzzah, you got it!

1371
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:08,040
Hit me again.

1372
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:18,400
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1373
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:25,840
No man left behind.

1374
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:31,020
Apparently, I didn't say no woman when I let Olivia get caught.

1375
01:29:32,380 --> 01:29:34,920
We take this.

1376
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:37,840
Yeah, Olivia's not a man.

1377
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:52,640
Oh,

1378
01:29:58,320 --> 01:29:58,700
there he is.

1379
01:30:01,020 --> 01:30:02,360
Does he not recognize him?

1380
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:03,400
His voice?

1381
01:30:07,900 --> 01:30:10,080
I didn't know we were into that fight.

1382
01:30:10,260 --> 01:30:13,420
Oh, thank you for the super chat.

1383
01:30:13,540 --> 01:30:14,380
Thank you, thank you.

1384
01:30:16,740 --> 01:30:18,260
Daniel, thank you for the super chat.

1385
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:19,180
Thank you, thank you.

1386
01:30:20,460 --> 01:30:22,100
That's the guy who attacked us!

1387
01:30:22,900 --> 01:30:24,600
That's why I'm ratting him out right now.

1388
01:30:31,740 --> 01:30:33,360
There's a different story?

1389
01:30:35,700 --> 01:30:37,780
They all work together?

1390
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:40,240
How is the story different?

1391
01:30:44,780 --> 01:30:46,840
Somebody stop him!

1392
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:52,820
Okay, that did nothing.

1393
01:30:52,820 --> 01:30:55,580
Nothing built can last forever, Gabriel.

1394
01:30:59,700 --> 01:31:02,500
What does he do with the command block?

1395
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:06,540
Oh my god, he's commanding it!

1396
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:10,580
Oh my god, that's what the slash attack!

1397
01:31:13,060 --> 01:31:14,540
That's right, do it again!

1398
01:31:25,240 --> 01:31:28,880
What if I...

1399
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:30,880
Slash pop attack!

1400
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:38,300
What's he gonna do, kill me?

1401
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:40,440
Slash attack!

1402
01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:41,100
Do it!

1403
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:44,780
I'm a tank, guys.

1404
01:31:55,430 --> 01:32:01,010
You can tank those, you have a... you literally have a desert army.

1405
01:32:11,630 --> 01:32:13,250
Oh my god, he has admin!

1406
01:32:13,490 --> 01:32:13,970
Slash retreat!

1407
01:32:17,650 --> 01:32:18,470
Oh no.

1408
01:32:19,990 --> 01:32:20,770
Wait, is that not the command?

1409
01:32:20,930 --> 01:32:21,470
Slash retreat!

1410
01:32:22,470 --> 01:32:23,470
Command error.

1411
01:32:27,450 --> 01:32:30,730
The command is right, he forgot the command!

1412
01:32:31,730 --> 01:32:33,330
He forgot the command!

1413
01:32:33,990 --> 01:32:36,150
Add slash E4, E4!

1414
01:32:36,770 --> 01:32:38,230
He forgot the slash!

1415
01:32:56,030 --> 01:32:58,350
Oh my god, I will be admin!

1416
01:32:59,230 --> 01:32:59,870
No!

1417
01:33:13,430 --> 01:33:15,990
What do you mean actions have consequences?

1418
01:33:16,390 --> 01:33:19,070
It's a Telltale game, what do you mean?

1419
01:33:22,350 --> 01:33:24,830
I wanted... okay, let him fly out.

1420
01:33:25,810 --> 01:33:28,390
Let him fly, I want to see what happens when he flies.

1421
01:33:31,190 --> 01:33:33,330
Let him fly into the wither!

1422
01:33:34,130 --> 01:33:35,550
Let him fly in!

1423
01:33:37,990 --> 01:33:40,590
That's where the guy that said he's their oshi.

1424
01:33:42,450 --> 01:33:44,750
I have to save him?

1425
01:33:45,290 --> 01:33:46,170
No, fly!

1426
01:33:46,470 --> 01:33:47,930
Fly into that wither!

1427
01:33:48,690 --> 01:33:53,330
Oh my god, I can't believe I actually have to save him.

1428
01:33:57,750 --> 01:34:01,270
Oh my god, if I fell it just like that makes me do it again.

1429
01:34:01,450 --> 01:34:03,410
I want to know what it looks like!

1430
01:34:12,850 --> 01:34:13,290
No!

1431
01:34:16,150 --> 01:34:18,410
Why does it have to be a canon event?

1432
01:34:20,050 --> 01:34:21,250
What if I don't say anything?

1433
01:34:24,710 --> 01:34:25,270
What?

1434
01:34:41,370 --> 01:34:44,110
Only winners write the history.

1435
01:34:45,010 --> 01:34:46,470
I'm not evil if I win.

1436
01:34:49,790 --> 01:34:52,090
How do I command block that?

1437
01:34:57,120 --> 01:34:58,680
Okay, we just need an admin.

1438
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,840
We just need a moderator to get on the server and do slash ban.

1439
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:08,940
Guys, no man left behind!

1440
01:35:09,620 --> 01:35:10,180
Guys!

1441
01:35:10,840 --> 01:35:11,900
What happened?

1442
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:15,540
What if I get sucked up?

1443
01:35:17,100 --> 01:35:17,620
Suck me?

1444
01:35:18,540 --> 01:35:19,300
Come on!

1445
01:35:21,580 --> 01:35:24,160
I want to be one with the wither!

1446
01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:26,800
Let me be one with the wither!

1447
01:35:27,060 --> 01:35:28,320
How much time do they give?

1448
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:28,840
Yeah!

1449
01:35:31,940 --> 01:35:33,880
Is that how I die?

1450
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:35,480
You died.

1451
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:36,720
You don't know that!

1452
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:38,800
I could be a part of the wither!

1453
01:35:45,060 --> 01:35:46,280
Guys, come on.

1454
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:48,340
There was so much time to save me too.

1455
01:35:48,420 --> 01:35:52,180
I had like a solid 20 seconds to be saved.

1456
01:35:55,240 --> 01:35:56,260
Alright, nice.

1457
01:35:57,600 --> 01:35:58,560
Hello, I'm okay.

1458
01:35:58,820 --> 01:36:00,560
Guys, if you were worried, I'm okay.

1459
01:36:01,180 --> 01:36:03,300
Wait, so all these people died in front of me?

1460
01:36:04,680 --> 01:36:05,820
That's what you get?

1461
01:36:05,980 --> 01:36:08,700
Wait, if I died there...

1462
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:17,260
It's like the Heavy Rain gameplay where I just fail all my quick time events.

1463
01:36:17,260 --> 01:36:19,500
Thank you for the super chat.

1464
01:36:19,620 --> 01:36:20,320
Thank you, thank you.

1465
01:36:20,460 --> 01:36:23,200
That's what you get for trying to kill my Oshie.

1466
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:38,720
Oh no.

1467
01:36:47,160 --> 01:36:49,180
Don't worry, I'm holding on!

1468
01:36:51,120 --> 01:36:52,580
I did it, guys!

1469
01:36:55,880 --> 01:36:58,680
Become one with the wither.

1470
01:36:59,080 --> 01:36:59,900
I'm a hero.

1471
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:08,780
We didn't die, technically.

1472
01:37:14,740 --> 01:37:17,700
Yeah, I did it, guys!

1473
01:37:18,360 --> 01:37:19,180
All me!

1474
01:37:25,590 --> 01:37:27,510
What did I just...

1475
01:37:29,470 --> 01:37:30,590
What happens?

1476
01:37:39,340 --> 01:37:40,080
I

1477
01:37:47,020 --> 01:37:49,640
did it by doing nothing at all!

1478
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:02,630
No punishment.

1479
01:38:03,030 --> 01:38:04,930
What did I just... Oh shit!

1480
01:38:05,330 --> 01:38:06,550
It's okay, I can climb out!

1481
01:38:08,830 --> 01:38:09,570
Yeah!

1482
01:38:09,570 --> 01:38:09,610
Yeah!

1483
01:38:14,270 --> 01:38:16,130
It was a cannon.

1484
01:38:16,350 --> 01:38:17,110
No consequences!

1485
01:38:18,150 --> 01:38:19,070
Let's go!

1486
01:38:20,190 --> 01:38:21,850
Okay, I won't follow them.

1487
01:38:22,510 --> 01:38:23,630
They look more confident.

1488
01:38:24,730 --> 01:38:26,630
I mean, they literally have Gabriels there.

1489
01:38:27,710 --> 01:38:29,110
Oh my god, goodbye, creeper.

1490
01:38:29,590 --> 01:38:30,570
Oh no!

1491
01:38:30,730 --> 01:38:31,670
Oh fuck, okay.

1492
01:38:32,590 --> 01:38:33,590
I died.

1493
01:38:34,150 --> 01:38:36,070
Okay, apparently that has consequences.

1494
01:38:40,410 --> 01:38:42,730
Wait, can I go in the... Oh my god, you're right!

1495
01:38:42,810 --> 01:38:44,290
Wait, what happens if I go in the middle?

1496
01:38:44,590 --> 01:38:47,270
I don't know, I thought they would give me no consequences!

1497
01:38:50,250 --> 01:38:52,190
Okay, let me fall back in the hole again.

1498
01:38:53,330 --> 01:38:55,030
Wait, what happens if I go in the middle?

1499
01:38:56,090 --> 01:39:00,570
Do I just run through the... I just run through the forest?

1500
01:39:06,670 --> 01:39:07,830
Alright, what happens?

1501
01:39:11,870 --> 01:39:13,110
Oh, I just go left.

1502
01:39:13,230 --> 01:39:14,350
Yeah, I follow the winners.

1503
01:39:14,510 --> 01:39:16,150
Okay, now I actually have to move, guys.

1504
01:39:17,030 --> 01:39:18,670
Alright, don't worry.

1505
01:39:25,160 --> 01:39:25,780
See, Reuben?

1506
01:39:26,040 --> 01:39:28,140
That's how you take the fire, Reuben!

1507
01:39:29,680 --> 01:39:30,860
Okay, I had to dodge that.

1508
01:39:30,920 --> 01:39:32,040
I didn't know if I would die.

1509
01:39:32,120 --> 01:39:33,260
Wait, what if I don't die?

1510
01:39:33,680 --> 01:39:34,680
Look at that, I'm fine.

1511
01:39:35,340 --> 01:39:37,040
Just a little HP loss.

1512
01:39:40,980 --> 01:39:41,880
Oh, shit!

1513
01:39:42,160 --> 01:39:43,740
Oh, fuck, he's gonna eat me!

1514
01:39:43,900 --> 01:39:44,480
Oh, okay.

1515
01:39:47,620 --> 01:39:48,480
Okay, everything.

1516
01:39:48,660 --> 01:39:49,560
Everybody is fine.

1517
01:39:50,160 --> 01:39:51,280
Okay, now I know.

1518
01:39:52,820 --> 01:39:54,240
Oh, I got this.

1519
01:39:57,950 --> 01:39:59,210
Okay, watch this.

1520
01:40:02,990 --> 01:40:04,430
I pressed it!

1521
01:40:04,850 --> 01:40:05,450
I pressed it!

1522
01:40:07,130 --> 01:40:08,690
Okay, this is fine.

1523
01:40:09,530 --> 01:40:10,890
I figured it out.

1524
01:40:11,150 --> 01:40:11,830
Look, see?

1525
01:40:12,110 --> 01:40:13,410
Oh, epic dodge.

1526
01:40:14,210 --> 01:40:15,470
Oh my god!

1527
01:40:15,630 --> 01:40:16,570
Oh, so cool.

1528
01:40:17,810 --> 01:40:19,570
Okay, now watch this.

1529
01:40:21,830 --> 01:40:22,790
There we go.

1530
01:40:23,030 --> 01:40:24,370
I look so cool there.

1531
01:40:26,370 --> 01:40:26,730
Hurry!

1532
01:40:27,270 --> 01:40:27,710
Inside the temple!

1533
01:40:29,370 --> 01:40:31,510
The inner chamber is built entirely of obsidian.

1534
01:40:32,030 --> 01:40:33,610
We should be untouchable in there.

1535
01:40:34,030 --> 01:40:35,050
Tom, thank you for the super chat!

1536
01:40:35,150 --> 01:40:35,770
Thank you, thank you!

1537
01:40:35,810 --> 01:40:36,750
I love the way you laugh.

1538
01:40:36,830 --> 01:40:37,330
Thank you!

1539
01:40:37,350 --> 01:40:38,630
I'm glad you enjoyed my laugh!

1540
01:40:39,090 --> 01:40:39,990
Thank you for the super chat!

1541
01:40:40,130 --> 01:40:40,990
Thank you, thank you!

1542
01:40:44,150 --> 01:40:45,450
Oh wait, are we going to the nether?

1543
01:40:46,430 --> 01:40:46,790
Hurry!

1544
01:40:47,170 --> 01:40:49,310
If you can get through the portal, you'll be safe!

1545
01:40:51,410 --> 01:40:52,750
It's not lit!

1546
01:40:53,030 --> 01:40:54,070
I have a flint and steel!

1547
01:40:57,010 --> 01:40:57,610
I'm sorry.

1548
01:41:01,450 --> 01:41:02,170
Yeah?

1549
01:41:10,430 --> 01:41:13,970
If we die, we all die together.

1550
01:41:16,150 --> 01:41:16,830
Gabriel!

1551
01:41:17,770 --> 01:41:23,070
I was just thinking... I just want to die with my friends.

1552
01:41:25,290 --> 01:41:26,910
Let him die.

1553
01:41:27,610 --> 01:41:28,170
Goodbye.

1554
01:41:28,510 --> 01:41:29,430
Wait, not me!

1555
01:41:29,530 --> 01:41:29,910
Not me!

1556
01:41:30,950 --> 01:41:33,230
I just wanted him to die!

1557
01:41:33,250 --> 01:41:33,630
Everyone, get in!

1558
01:41:33,750 --> 01:41:34,110
Now!

1559
01:41:36,670 --> 01:41:38,270
Alright, we got this.

1560
01:41:38,670 --> 01:41:39,350
Gabriel!

1561
01:41:40,490 --> 01:41:41,550
Don't worry!

1562
01:41:44,050 --> 01:41:44,910
Look at that!

1563
01:41:45,010 --> 01:41:45,750
It looks so cool!

1564
01:41:45,850 --> 01:41:46,530
First try!

1565
01:41:47,550 --> 01:41:48,470
First try!

1566
01:41:51,790 --> 01:41:54,330
I wanted good nether radar, mate.

1567
01:42:01,150 --> 01:42:04,970
Oh no, definitely the casualty rate is 90%.

1568
01:42:08,290 --> 01:42:08,930
Others?

1569
01:42:14,130 --> 01:42:15,770
There were four of them.

1570
01:42:16,170 --> 01:42:18,290
So there's only one more person.

1571
01:42:21,430 --> 01:42:24,030
Wait, how would I find them?

1572
01:42:43,100 --> 01:42:44,060
Oh shit.

1573
01:42:44,340 --> 01:42:44,660
Sorry.

1574
01:42:59,860 --> 01:43:01,280
What if I don't say anything?

1575
01:43:10,240 --> 01:43:10,460
No!

1576
01:43:10,600 --> 01:43:11,580
Don't be a hero!

1577
01:43:15,820 --> 01:43:16,260
No!

1578
01:43:16,900 --> 01:43:18,000
Don't be stupid!

1579
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:22,760
Okay.

1580
01:43:24,760 --> 01:43:26,020
Alright, I guess I'll go.

1581
01:43:26,440 --> 01:43:27,480
Alright, we gotta go to the portal.

1582
01:43:28,980 --> 01:43:31,140
Lucas, go to the portal, Lucas!

1583
01:43:32,360 --> 01:43:33,780
Who do I save?

1584
01:43:33,880 --> 01:43:34,600
I'm saving Gabriel.

1585
01:43:37,340 --> 01:43:38,860
Who do I save?

1586
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:41,020
One has misery armor!

1587
01:43:41,480 --> 01:43:43,960
The other one is holding a gold sword!

1588
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:47,480
No!

1589
01:43:49,340 --> 01:43:52,620
No man left behind!

1590
01:43:57,480 --> 01:44:00,240
One was literally holding a gold sword!

1591
01:44:00,460 --> 01:44:02,560
Who do you think I'm gonna save?

1592
01:44:04,740 --> 01:44:06,700
We did everything we could.

1593
01:44:06,700 --> 01:44:08,020
We did everything we could.

1594
01:44:08,020 --> 01:44:10,260
He froze.

1595
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:28,120
Guys, we did everything we could, guys.

1596
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:34,060
Guys, Gabriel had netherite armor and a netherite diamond sword!

1597
01:44:35,500 --> 01:44:40,860
She had no armor and a gold sword that she stole.

1598
01:44:42,520 --> 01:44:43,500
She's dead.

1599
01:44:47,480 --> 01:44:49,000
She's most likely dead.

1600
01:44:49,120 --> 01:44:50,020
She doesn't have a bed.

1601
01:44:55,700 --> 01:44:57,100
E-boy?

1602
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:00,280
E-boy?

1603
01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:02,560
Yeah, is that one killed the ender dragon?

1604
01:45:02,820 --> 01:45:04,280
The other is a criminal.

1605
01:45:04,600 --> 01:45:10,220
Oh shit.

1606
01:45:23,490 --> 01:45:24,590
That's illegal!

1607
01:45:25,270 --> 01:45:26,450
I've ruined everything!

1608
01:45:27,210 --> 01:45:28,570
You stole first!

1609
01:45:28,850 --> 01:45:29,250
Punch him.

1610
01:45:29,930 --> 01:45:30,810
I'mma punch him.

1611
01:45:31,190 --> 01:45:32,290
I talk in violence.

1612
01:45:32,590 --> 01:45:33,990
I'm alpha now.

1613
01:45:35,830 --> 01:45:36,710
That's right.

1614
01:45:38,590 --> 01:45:39,910
It made me feel better.

1615
01:45:41,990 --> 01:45:43,350
Wait, I saved him.

1616
01:45:57,790 --> 01:45:59,230
Oh, so she's alive!

1617
01:45:59,350 --> 01:45:59,910
See guys?

1618
01:45:59,970 --> 01:46:00,910
I told you!

1619
01:46:01,930 --> 01:46:02,510
She's alive!

1620
01:46:05,030 --> 01:46:06,410
Guys, I did not... See?

1621
01:46:06,470 --> 01:46:07,270
I didn't fuck up.

1622
01:46:20,730 --> 01:46:21,410
Alright,

1623
01:46:34,970 --> 01:46:36,130
we should listen to him.

1624
01:46:37,270 --> 01:46:37,650
He's right.

1625
01:46:39,450 --> 01:46:40,730
She can't remember that!

1626
01:46:40,850 --> 01:46:42,010
She's not even here!

1627
01:46:42,590 --> 01:46:44,730
She's not even here to know I didn't defend her.

1628
01:46:51,550 --> 01:46:53,470
Oh my god, is that an invisibility potion?

1629
01:46:54,230 --> 01:46:54,630
See?

1630
01:46:54,770 --> 01:46:55,230
I told you.

1631
01:46:55,290 --> 01:46:57,150
Hitting him was the way to go.

1632
01:46:59,230 --> 01:46:59,630
Melting?

1633
01:46:59,830 --> 01:47:01,410
Thank you for the super chat.

1634
01:47:01,650 --> 01:47:02,450
Thank you, thank you.

1635
01:47:02,590 --> 01:47:03,970
Oh shit, it's a ghast.

1636
01:47:07,670 --> 01:47:10,070
Look, she had a gold sword!

1637
01:47:10,250 --> 01:47:13,250
What the fuck am I gonna do with someone with a gold sword?

1638
01:47:22,340 --> 01:47:26,960
It's okay, I'm just gaining level up experience every time.

1639
01:47:31,680 --> 01:47:32,880
I'm getting XP.

1640
01:47:33,340 --> 01:47:34,560
The more things I tank.

1641
01:47:51,210 --> 01:47:53,450
Oh my god, it's like a rollercoaster.

1642
01:47:53,590 --> 01:47:54,470
Put your hands up.

1643
01:47:54,990 --> 01:47:55,990
Hands in the air!

1644
01:47:55,990 --> 01:47:56,550
Woo!

1645
01:48:00,950 --> 01:48:01,510
Yippee!

1646
01:48:04,050 --> 01:48:04,610
Yay!

1647
01:48:18,260 --> 01:48:21,160
Oh my god, it's okay, it's okay guys.

1648
01:48:21,560 --> 01:48:24,700
I don't have a concussion guys, I don't need to see a doctor.

1649
01:48:26,660 --> 01:48:30,080
The more hits I get, the more immune I will be for more damage.

1650
01:48:32,660 --> 01:48:34,640
Oh, arms don't fail me now.

1651
01:48:37,200 --> 01:48:40,060
We can all die together.

1652
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:56,960
Where did everybody go?

1653
01:48:57,300 --> 01:48:59,040
My actions have consequences?

1654
01:49:01,340 --> 01:49:02,480
Oh shit.

1655
01:49:04,040 --> 01:49:04,940
I got you!

1656
01:49:07,780 --> 01:49:09,700
I got you, Ruben!

1657
01:49:12,080 --> 01:49:13,940
Okay, I need to look at him.

1658
01:49:14,380 --> 01:49:15,660
I see Ruben!

1659
01:49:15,720 --> 01:49:17,200
I was gonna save you.

1660
01:49:23,820 --> 01:49:25,800
I did it, I'm a hero!

1661
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:31,160
Oh my god, I did it!

1662
01:49:32,620 --> 01:49:35,580
See, if I didn't duck, how would I have known?

1663
01:49:36,700 --> 01:49:37,740
Ow, okay, wait.

1664
01:49:37,980 --> 01:49:39,140
Give me a sec, I can time this.

1665
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:41,060
Look at that.

1666
01:49:42,320 --> 01:49:43,560
Ow, okay, look at that.

1667
01:49:43,620 --> 01:49:44,780
I can time this, guys.

1668
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:47,920
Now for the actual gameplay.

1669
01:49:48,180 --> 01:49:48,580
Boom!

1670
01:50:03,480 --> 01:50:04,260
Oh my god, he's back.

1671
01:50:04,680 --> 01:50:05,520
Where are your children?

1672
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:06,980
So I can kidnap them.

1673
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:08,760
Oh, Ruben!

1674
01:50:23,250 --> 01:50:25,330
Hey guys, what are you guys doing?

1675
01:50:47,900 --> 01:50:49,980
I handled it.

1676
01:50:53,600 --> 01:50:54,820
Yeah, I was doing a great job.

1677
01:50:59,680 --> 01:51:00,540
Yeah, right, Ruben?

1678
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:02,660
We were so cool.

1679
01:51:03,820 --> 01:51:04,760
Ruben, why are you mad?

1680
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:06,120
I saved your life!

1681
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:10,120
I saved your life, Ruben!

1682
01:51:10,120 --> 01:51:14,360
After the skeleton guy shot a couple of arrows, but I still do it.

1683
01:51:17,260 --> 01:51:18,460
Still did it!

1684
01:51:22,220 --> 01:51:23,680
Why is he mad?

1685
01:51:29,120 --> 01:51:30,280
Ruben remembers.

1686
01:51:32,860 --> 01:51:34,120
How does he remember?

1687
01:51:34,260 --> 01:51:34,920
He's a pig.

1688
01:51:41,680 --> 01:51:42,820
There's the portal.

1689
01:51:44,820 --> 01:51:46,120
There it is.

1690
01:51:47,360 --> 01:51:48,680
That's our way out.

1691
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
How many blocks away are we in the overworld?

1692
01:51:51,860 --> 01:51:54,220
The surface is also where that creature is.

1693
01:51:56,240 --> 01:51:56,940
He's right.

1694
01:51:57,380 --> 01:51:59,560
We have no idea what we're walking into.

1695
01:51:59,880 --> 01:52:00,900
It could be dangerous.

1696
01:52:03,540 --> 01:52:04,900
Well, slash command block.

1697
01:52:05,780 --> 01:52:06,340
Slash delete.

1698
01:52:07,500 --> 01:52:09,280
Thanks for being so brave, Axel.

1699
01:52:10,300 --> 01:52:11,980
Alright, I'm gonna go.

1700
01:52:12,140 --> 01:52:12,900
I'm going.

1701
01:52:13,120 --> 01:52:14,560
I'm going right now.

1702
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:15,680
You got this!

1703
01:52:18,140 --> 01:52:19,480
Like right, right now.

1704
01:52:20,640 --> 01:52:21,480
Stop stalling.

1705
01:52:21,640 --> 01:52:23,360
I just need to make sure I have everything I'll need.

1706
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:25,180
Stop stalling?

1707
01:52:25,200 --> 01:52:25,400
Yeah!

1708
01:52:25,640 --> 01:52:27,080
You said you would go!

1709
01:52:27,180 --> 01:52:27,740
Exactly!

1710
01:52:28,220 --> 01:52:29,160
Don't push me, okay?

1711
01:52:29,380 --> 01:52:30,160
Here I go.

1712
01:52:31,840 --> 01:52:32,960
See, he did remember it.

1713
01:52:32,980 --> 01:52:33,180
Right behind you.

1714
01:52:33,860 --> 01:52:35,200
Be safe up there, Axel.

1715
01:52:35,900 --> 01:52:37,760
Ready or not, here I come.

1716
01:52:39,200 --> 01:52:41,300
Look, this is life or death, guys.

1717
01:52:41,720 --> 01:52:43,600
Only I can saw him, the main character.

1718
01:52:43,720 --> 01:52:45,200
He's just a side character.

1719
01:52:47,140 --> 01:52:48,800
Alright, who wants to go next, guys?

1720
01:52:49,580 --> 01:52:51,300
Guys, does anyone else want to go next?

1721
01:52:51,500 --> 01:52:52,380
Does anyone else?

1722
01:52:52,460 --> 01:52:52,820
Woah!

1723
01:52:53,500 --> 01:52:55,240
Hey guys, ladies first!

1724
01:53:04,560 --> 01:53:05,200
Look, see?

1725
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:05,620
He's okay.

1726
01:53:12,280 --> 01:53:12,720
See?

1727
01:53:12,820 --> 01:53:13,940
He was okay, guys.

1728
01:53:15,440 --> 01:53:17,580
Don't worry, I got you, Axel.

1729
01:53:21,380 --> 01:53:21,920
See?

1730
01:53:22,060 --> 01:53:22,800
I'm a hero.

1731
01:53:27,710 --> 01:53:29,250
What was I looking at?

1732
01:53:29,790 --> 01:53:31,430
Why did I look at there?

1733
01:53:46,950 --> 01:53:49,370
No, Ivar said...

1734
01:53:52,860 --> 01:53:54,570
Let them argue!

1735
01:53:55,230 --> 01:53:56,370
Let them fight!

1736
01:53:56,810 --> 01:53:57,870
Let them fight!

1737
01:54:02,800 --> 01:54:04,270
What is it?

1738
01:54:05,310 --> 01:54:05,950
Oh...

1739
01:54:05,950 --> 01:54:07,510
Do we actually agree on something?

1740
01:54:19,950 --> 01:54:20,390
What?

1741
01:54:21,330 --> 01:54:24,390
In a hut, we won't know what's coming until it's knocking on our door.

1742
01:54:24,610 --> 01:54:25,250
I want a hut!

1743
01:54:26,530 --> 01:54:27,870
I hate spiders.

1744
01:54:28,130 --> 01:54:29,310
I want to build a dirt house.

1745
01:54:30,410 --> 01:54:31,210
It's not...

1746
01:54:31,210 --> 01:54:31,970
That's it, Olivia.

1747
01:54:32,430 --> 01:54:33,150
Jesse made the call.

1748
01:54:33,150 --> 01:54:34,150
That's right, I'm the leader.

1749
01:54:34,410 --> 01:54:34,710
Get started.

1750
01:54:35,790 --> 01:54:37,350
I want to live in a dirt hut.

1751
01:54:41,640 --> 01:54:43,040
Like a true king.

1752
01:54:47,410 --> 01:54:48,570
Okay, let's go fast.

1753
01:54:48,670 --> 01:54:49,710
Oh my god, it's beautiful.

1754
01:54:50,890 --> 01:54:53,370
Okay, this is a little too big for a dirt house.

1755
01:54:56,930 --> 01:54:58,810
It's okay, we'll just look outside.

1756
01:55:09,610 --> 01:55:11,510
Return to the dirt house.

1757
01:55:11,890 --> 01:55:12,850
See, look at that.

1758
01:55:13,070 --> 01:55:13,950
Everything's fine.

1759
01:55:16,030 --> 01:55:18,590
How do we have fire on cement?

1760
01:55:20,030 --> 01:55:21,330
On stone?

1761
01:55:27,390 --> 01:55:30,490
What is it?

1762
01:55:33,390 --> 01:55:33,890
Oh!

1763
01:55:39,370 --> 01:55:42,170
For me.

1764
01:55:43,510 --> 01:55:44,210
Yay!

1765
01:55:59,970 --> 01:56:00,890
What?

1766
01:56:03,290 --> 01:56:04,910
Watch me eat this cookie, Lucas.

1767
01:56:05,530 --> 01:56:07,650
Watch me eat it.

1768
01:56:13,610 --> 01:56:15,370
That's right, Lucas.

1769
01:56:17,270 --> 01:56:20,830
Why is it up to me to share the cookie?

1770
01:56:21,570 --> 01:56:23,590
There's four of us.

1771
01:56:25,770 --> 01:56:28,270
She could've shared the cookie.

1772
01:56:30,110 --> 01:56:32,750
Olivia could've shared it.

1773
01:56:38,290 --> 01:56:40,370
She would've liked it.

1774
01:56:43,890 --> 01:56:46,810
Stop being mean to Lucas.

1775
01:56:49,170 --> 01:56:52,230
Guys, I'm not just mean.

1776
01:56:52,330 --> 01:56:54,550
I'm mean to everybody in this game.

1777
01:56:54,710 --> 01:56:55,450
It's all equal.

1778
01:56:56,190 --> 01:56:58,210
I'm not targeting anyone.

1779
01:56:58,870 --> 01:56:59,890
He was just there.

1780
01:57:02,690 --> 01:57:03,110
Fight!

1781
01:57:03,350 --> 01:57:03,790
Fight!

1782
01:57:04,090 --> 01:57:04,610
Fight!

1783
01:57:05,290 --> 01:57:05,990
Fight!

1784
01:57:06,370 --> 01:57:06,690
Fight!

1785
01:57:10,430 --> 01:57:11,230
Yeah.

1786
01:57:16,630 --> 01:57:17,430
Fight!

1787
01:57:17,810 --> 01:57:18,190
Fight!

1788
01:57:18,410 --> 01:57:18,890
Fight!

1789
01:57:29,990 --> 01:57:30,790
Fight!

1790
01:57:34,870 --> 01:57:34,870
Fight!

1791
01:57:35,010 --> 01:57:35,130
Fight!

1792
01:57:45,710 --> 01:57:47,050
Don't keep fighting.

1793
01:57:54,610 --> 01:57:55,770
Silent treatment.

1794
01:57:56,170 --> 01:57:57,810
Why do they keep fighting?

1795
01:57:59,330 --> 01:57:59,590
Wait.

1796
01:57:59,830 --> 01:58:02,630
No, no, you're staying with us.

1797
01:58:03,350 --> 01:58:05,310
I need you to...

1798
01:58:05,310 --> 01:58:06,790
I need him to keep fighting.

1799
01:58:07,390 --> 01:58:08,790
I need more people to torment.

1800
01:58:10,890 --> 01:58:11,650
Stay.

1801
01:58:12,210 --> 01:58:14,070
So I can eat another cookie in front of you.

1802
01:58:16,210 --> 01:58:17,590
I need more drama.

1803
01:58:17,910 --> 01:58:19,910
I need more drama.

1804
01:58:21,490 --> 01:58:23,270
I'm keeping him prisoner.

1805
01:58:27,610 --> 01:58:29,750
Finally a good choice.

1806
01:58:31,410 --> 01:58:32,330
No worries.

1807
01:58:32,750 --> 01:58:34,490
You're my entertainment.

1808
01:58:38,530 --> 01:58:41,190
He chose to be evil.

1809
01:58:42,030 --> 01:58:43,730
Thank you for the super chat.

1810
01:58:43,830 --> 01:58:44,170
Thank you.

1811
01:58:44,230 --> 01:58:45,290
Thank you.

1812
01:58:47,570 --> 01:58:50,230
No man left behind, guys.

1813
01:59:11,350 --> 01:59:13,170
Hey, is everything okay?

1814
01:59:14,090 --> 01:59:16,030
What if I say nothing to him?

1815
01:59:16,090 --> 01:59:18,090
I don't even comfort him.

1816
01:59:19,290 --> 01:59:20,070
Oh, shit.

1817
01:59:20,070 --> 01:59:21,390
I did it.

1818
01:59:28,310 --> 01:59:29,270
I did it.

1819
01:59:29,490 --> 01:59:32,490
He's just like, thanks, Jesse, for saying nothing.

1820
01:59:37,390 --> 01:59:40,690
Guys, don't need words to be understood, guys.

1821
01:59:41,090 --> 01:59:43,590
He saw it in my eyes.

1822
01:59:43,830 --> 01:59:45,190
He knew I was sorry.

1823
01:59:47,150 --> 01:59:47,590
Great.

1824
01:59:48,450 --> 01:59:50,130
He saw it in my eyes.

1825
01:59:50,210 --> 01:59:51,650
We don't need words.

1826
01:59:53,090 --> 01:59:53,930
What are you waiting for?

1827
01:59:54,050 --> 01:59:54,510
Let's go.

1828
01:59:56,410 --> 01:59:57,430
He's a true bro.

1829
01:59:57,670 --> 02:00:00,630
He looked into my eyes and realized...

1830
02:00:00,630 --> 02:00:01,750
I was sorry.

1831
02:00:01,850 --> 02:00:02,830
It's a bro thing, guys.

1832
02:00:03,190 --> 02:00:04,070
It's a bro code.

1833
02:00:08,550 --> 02:00:11,830
Yeah, it's in my little trinket.

1834
02:00:19,510 --> 02:00:21,470
CB Raricle, thank you for the super chat.

1835
02:00:21,590 --> 02:00:22,250
Thank you.

1836
02:00:22,410 --> 02:00:27,930
Thank you for the super chat.

1837
02:00:28,190 --> 02:00:28,770
Thank you.

1838
02:00:28,770 --> 02:00:31,930
Thank you for the super chat.

1839
02:00:31,930 --> 02:00:31,930
Thank you.

1840
02:00:32,390 --> 02:00:33,690
Yeah, we are.

1841
02:00:35,670 --> 02:00:36,770
Are these arrows?

1842
02:00:36,770 --> 02:00:38,770
Are these arrows?

1843
02:00:43,170 --> 02:00:44,290
Hey, guys, don't worry.

1844
02:00:44,370 --> 02:00:45,070
I got this.

1845
02:00:45,210 --> 02:00:46,010
I'm a hero.

1846
02:00:46,910 --> 02:00:48,270
I'm the protagonist.

1847
02:00:48,650 --> 02:00:50,190
We got this, guys.

1848
02:00:54,210 --> 02:00:59,030
Hey, Reuben, you still have your black eye.

1849
02:01:03,350 --> 02:01:04,390
Oh, no.

1850
02:01:09,890 --> 02:01:10,370
Run!

1851
02:01:13,250 --> 02:01:14,250
No, an arrow.

1852
02:01:17,530 --> 02:01:18,710
It's okay, guys.

1853
02:01:19,190 --> 02:01:19,590
I'm...

1854
02:01:21,230 --> 02:01:22,910
Okay, three arrows.

1855
02:01:23,210 --> 02:01:24,670
Okay, it's three arrows, guys.

1856
02:01:24,710 --> 02:01:25,590
I figured it out.

1857
02:01:26,230 --> 02:01:27,190
I didn't know this.

1858
02:01:27,230 --> 02:01:28,790
I thought I could take it all.

1859
02:01:31,610 --> 02:01:32,230
Don't worry.

1860
02:01:32,290 --> 02:01:33,030
I got it now.

1861
02:01:33,690 --> 02:01:35,170
Who would have thought arrows hurt?

1862
02:01:40,210 --> 02:01:40,930
Don't worry.

1863
02:01:41,170 --> 02:01:43,670
I know it's three arrows now.

1864
02:01:45,570 --> 02:01:46,410
See, look.

1865
02:01:46,590 --> 02:01:47,330
There you go.

1866
02:01:47,430 --> 02:01:47,950
I live.

1867
02:01:55,370 --> 02:01:56,250
Wait, again?

1868
02:02:07,330 --> 02:02:10,550
Don't keep commanding your troops in World War 2.

1869
02:02:11,290 --> 02:02:12,150
Dot, dot, dot.

1870
02:02:12,410 --> 02:02:14,110
Okay, thank you for the super chat.

1871
02:02:14,210 --> 02:02:14,510
Thank you.

1872
02:02:14,550 --> 02:02:15,070
Thank you.

1873
02:02:26,250 --> 02:02:27,050
What do we use first?

1874
02:02:27,170 --> 02:02:27,750
Oh, the door.

1875
02:02:31,290 --> 02:02:32,670
Wait, is it a fishing rod?

1876
02:02:49,420 --> 02:02:50,900
What do I do?

1877
02:02:57,700 --> 02:02:59,260
Does this make anything?

1878
02:03:07,640 --> 02:03:08,220
What?

1879
02:03:08,220 --> 02:03:12,450
Is this something?

1880
02:03:13,370 --> 02:03:14,170
Oh, wait.

1881
02:03:14,290 --> 02:03:15,230
This is arrow, right?

1882
02:03:17,550 --> 02:03:20,190
Oh, shit!

1883
02:03:20,390 --> 02:03:20,550
Okay.

1884
02:03:21,470 --> 02:03:22,950
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

1885
02:03:23,030 --> 02:03:24,310
Guys, I always knew.

1886
02:03:24,470 --> 02:03:26,270
Guys, guys, I always knew.

1887
02:03:26,810 --> 02:03:28,890
Guys, uh...

1888
02:03:29,630 --> 02:03:30,210
Okay.

1889
02:03:34,990 --> 02:03:36,250
I figured it out.

1890
02:03:37,270 --> 02:03:38,390
Look, see?

1891
02:03:38,650 --> 02:03:39,710
Here's our bow.

1892
02:03:40,050 --> 02:03:41,290
I did it!

1893
02:03:42,310 --> 02:03:43,950
And then...

1894
02:04:04,520 --> 02:04:06,880
And then feather here.

1895
02:04:07,820 --> 02:04:08,940
So it makes like an arrow.

1896
02:04:10,280 --> 02:04:10,660
Yay!

1897
02:04:15,640 --> 02:04:19,120
Are we creating... how many arrows do I have?

1898
02:04:20,320 --> 02:04:21,200
I'm curious.

1899
02:04:22,440 --> 02:04:24,860
Oh, I can hit... I can only hit that.

1900
02:04:24,940 --> 02:04:25,780
Okay, I was gonna say.

1901
02:04:26,220 --> 02:04:27,360
What if I use it all up?

1902
02:04:34,670 --> 02:04:35,870
I did it, guys.

1903
02:04:44,950 --> 02:04:48,750
I'll just use up all my arrows and then I wanna see how they respond to that.

1904
02:04:49,710 --> 02:04:51,150
Oh, there's the enchantment room.

1905
02:04:52,170 --> 02:04:53,430
What would I enchant, though?

1906
02:04:55,570 --> 02:04:57,130
Oh, that's his... is this his area?

1907
02:04:58,230 --> 02:04:59,470
He just recreated it?

1908
02:05:00,310 --> 02:05:01,350
Guys, remember what we did?

1909
02:05:01,430 --> 02:05:02,090
We stole stuff.

1910
02:05:02,210 --> 02:05:03,330
Let's recreate that.

1911
02:05:09,850 --> 02:05:10,250
Oh,

1912
02:05:16,740 --> 02:05:16,900
look.

1913
02:05:16,940 --> 02:05:18,420
There's the enchantment book.

1914
02:05:44,020 --> 02:05:45,160
Oh, there were five?

1915
02:05:52,920 --> 02:05:58,120
I thought he was the wizard, but older and he got creepier.

1916
02:06:04,700 --> 02:06:07,200
He was written out of history.

1917
02:06:08,040 --> 02:06:09,400
Wait, Gabriel didn't mention this.

1918
02:06:15,560 --> 02:06:17,720
Oh, so he was the support player.

1919
02:06:18,500 --> 02:06:19,320
He was their support.

1920
02:06:21,480 --> 02:06:23,940
Oh my god, he fucked over the healing.

1921
02:06:28,640 --> 02:06:29,860
Now do it again.

1922
02:06:39,020 --> 02:06:41,060
Oh my god, he pissed off the healer.

1923
02:06:41,060 --> 02:06:42,280
You never piss off the healer.

1924
02:06:42,340 --> 02:06:43,640
They're the most spiteful ones.

1925
02:06:44,260 --> 02:06:45,680
I say as I'm a healer, man.

1926
02:06:46,360 --> 02:06:48,040
No, we are very spiteful people.

1927
02:06:50,640 --> 02:06:52,840
We go up.

1928
02:07:04,620 --> 02:07:09,540
Wasn't like... wasn't like Pirate Software the support in their group, too?

1929
02:07:15,340 --> 02:07:15,740
Gabriel?

1930
02:07:27,020 --> 02:07:28,620
No, he was the mage?

1931
02:07:28,740 --> 02:07:31,060
I thought he was... because I knew he was the magic user.

1932
02:07:31,060 --> 02:07:34,880
Is something supposed to happen?

1933
02:07:37,620 --> 02:07:40,660
Because I was going to say, if he was the support, it makes more sense.

1934
02:07:47,930 --> 02:07:48,950
Where's the order?

1935
02:07:49,410 --> 02:07:51,150
I'm calling the order out.

1936
02:08:09,810 --> 02:08:13,130
Don't worry, I tried everything I could to save her.

1937
02:08:16,830 --> 02:08:17,430
Whoa!

1938
02:08:18,450 --> 02:08:19,350
They were everywhere.

1939
02:08:19,830 --> 02:08:20,430
Where was me?

1940
02:08:23,470 --> 02:08:24,390
Where's me?

1941
02:08:24,790 --> 02:08:26,270
Where am I in this area?

1942
02:08:36,870 --> 02:08:37,350
Yeah.

1943
02:08:47,150 --> 02:08:48,010
Hey, Reuben.

1944
02:08:48,210 --> 02:08:49,530
What are you doing there, little guy?

1945
02:08:52,370 --> 02:08:53,150
Sniff out.

1946
02:08:53,350 --> 02:08:54,390
Sniff them out for me.

1947
02:08:55,730 --> 02:08:55,970
Reuben?

1948
02:08:58,050 --> 02:08:59,570
No wonder you die.

1949
02:09:07,010 --> 02:09:08,170
Who'd have thought it, huh?

1950
02:09:08,590 --> 02:09:12,450
A bunch of small towners like us wrapped up in an adventure like this.

1951
02:09:13,410 --> 02:09:14,810
Yeah, it's pretty insane.

1952
02:09:14,990 --> 02:09:17,970
I just hope we all come out the other side in one piece.

1953
02:09:20,210 --> 02:09:21,090
Oh, okay.

1954
02:09:21,510 --> 02:09:22,470
Do I just put stuff there?

1955
02:09:24,990 --> 02:09:26,130
Guys, I'm only joking.

1956
02:09:26,230 --> 02:09:28,550
He's gonna live for a very long time, guys.

1957
02:09:29,690 --> 02:09:31,810
I would never let anything hurt Reuben.

1958
02:09:31,810 --> 02:09:31,830
Good.

1959
02:09:34,530 --> 02:09:36,270
Let me put this in there.

1960
02:09:38,150 --> 02:09:38,790
Yeah.

1961
02:09:39,210 --> 02:09:40,590
Put the amulet on here.

1962
02:09:41,470 --> 02:09:45,070
Oh, and then the sun shines through it and it's gonna show where they live.

1963
02:09:49,380 --> 02:09:50,020
Yeah.

1964
02:09:50,200 --> 02:09:50,440
Oh!

1965
02:09:52,500 --> 02:09:53,140
Okay.

1966
02:09:54,200 --> 02:09:55,000
Puzzle time.

1967
02:10:01,640 --> 02:10:03,540
What do I do here?

1968
02:10:03,540 --> 02:10:04,320
Okay.

1969
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:06,680
Oh my god, okay.

1970
02:10:07,120 --> 02:10:07,360
Okay.

1971
02:10:08,180 --> 02:10:10,400
Guys, this is a children's game.

1972
02:10:10,840 --> 02:10:12,600
There's no way I can mess this up.

1973
02:10:13,620 --> 02:10:16,040
This is a... There's no way.

1974
02:10:16,340 --> 02:10:17,100
Oh my god, Nimi!

1975
02:10:17,240 --> 02:10:18,320
Thank you for the raid!

1976
02:10:18,900 --> 02:10:20,660
I hope you enjoyed Elden Ring!

1977
02:10:21,720 --> 02:10:23,580
I'm figuring this out, guys.

1978
02:10:24,680 --> 02:10:28,660
There's no way a child can beat this game.

1979
02:10:29,460 --> 02:10:30,920
What if I just turn them all on?

1980
02:10:31,920 --> 02:10:32,520
Wait.

1981
02:10:33,520 --> 02:10:35,240
What do the lights mean?

1982
02:10:35,720 --> 02:10:37,160
What do they mean?

1983
02:10:37,740 --> 02:10:38,340
Okay.

1984
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:40,360
Let's turn this off.

1985
02:10:40,980 --> 02:10:43,280
Guys, don't... No, we're not gonna be here forever.

1986
02:10:43,600 --> 02:10:44,920
I'm figuring this out.

1987
02:10:46,340 --> 02:10:48,020
Okay, that doesn't do anything.

1988
02:10:49,040 --> 02:10:50,140
I did it!

1989
02:10:50,240 --> 02:10:51,500
Wait, what is this?

1990
02:10:51,740 --> 02:10:56,080
I just turned it on and off!

1991
02:10:56,200 --> 02:10:57,280
What did that mean?

1992
02:10:59,080 --> 02:10:59,520
What?

1993
02:11:09,340 --> 02:11:11,340
Oh, this is a tracking system.

1994
02:11:11,700 --> 02:11:11,840
Yeah.

1995
02:11:14,440 --> 02:11:15,320
I cracked the code.

1996
02:11:15,380 --> 02:11:16,680
Just turn it on and off, guys.

1997
02:11:30,940 --> 02:11:32,760
What do we know?

1998
02:11:34,200 --> 02:11:37,080
We have to stop Ivor.

1999
02:11:38,920 --> 02:11:41,460
Guys, she doesn't need our help.

2000
02:11:41,580 --> 02:11:42,400
It's fine.

2001
02:11:43,300 --> 02:11:45,220
She's a strong, independent woman.

2002
02:11:46,720 --> 02:11:48,460
She'll want us to stop the villain.

2003
02:11:51,180 --> 02:11:51,640
Wait,

2004
02:11:55,840 --> 02:11:56,020
what?

2005
02:11:56,460 --> 02:11:57,100
Oh, yeah.

2006
02:11:57,420 --> 02:12:00,720
Sora was just... I bet he's like missing in the nether or something.

2007
02:12:04,180 --> 02:12:06,400
Yeah, her gold sword will keep her safe.

2008
02:12:13,500 --> 02:12:15,000
No, Lucas, come with us.

2009
02:12:16,560 --> 02:12:17,880
Yeah, we need you with us.

2010
02:12:17,960 --> 02:12:18,440
Don't worry.

2011
02:12:18,440 --> 02:12:18,740
Don't worry.

2012
02:12:20,660 --> 02:12:22,540
There's a reason why I kept you.

2013
02:12:24,520 --> 02:12:25,560
Wait, what the fuck?

2014
02:12:29,900 --> 02:12:31,400
Lucas, I need drama!

2015
02:12:51,240 --> 02:12:52,140
Wait, what?

2016
02:12:58,980 --> 02:13:02,980
Wait, who was the other guy?

2017
02:13:03,160 --> 02:13:04,060
Is it the other guy?

2018
02:13:06,480 --> 02:13:07,520
Oh, that's...

2019
02:13:08,600 --> 02:13:09,120
Okay.

2020
02:13:10,060 --> 02:13:11,000
Alright, guys.

2021
02:13:11,860 --> 02:13:13,780
Do we get the one with the master degree?

2022
02:13:14,180 --> 02:13:15,860
Or the one that goes big boom?

2023
02:13:16,920 --> 02:13:19,420
You know what I'm gonna pick, guys.

2024
02:13:22,700 --> 02:13:27,940
You know exactly which one I'm gonna pick.

2025
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:29,820
Let me pick!

2026
02:13:30,200 --> 02:13:30,960
Let me pick!

2027
02:13:32,520 --> 02:13:34,500
Guys, he brings the big boom.

2028
02:13:35,860 --> 02:13:39,880
She was like... Olivia's like, you're my best friend.

2029
02:13:40,280 --> 02:13:41,440
And I'm like, boom.

2030
02:13:46,660 --> 02:13:48,600
I'm only doing this for Petra.

2031
02:13:49,610 --> 02:13:50,520
I'll take it.

2032
02:13:52,280 --> 02:13:54,460
I'm here for the big boom.

2033
02:13:54,680 --> 02:13:55,760
Uh, guys?

2034
02:13:57,640 --> 02:13:57,940
Huh?

2035
02:14:03,800 --> 02:14:05,100
Oh, there he is.

2036
02:14:05,340 --> 02:14:08,020
There's slash command... slash command block.

2037
02:14:08,380 --> 02:14:09,000
Please hurry.

2038
02:14:15,520 --> 02:14:16,120
I did it!

2039
02:14:16,120 --> 02:14:17,300
Oh wait, is that episode one?

2040
02:14:18,360 --> 02:14:21,480
Oh my god, each episode is like an hour and a half long.

2041
02:14:26,480 --> 02:14:29,920
Oh my god.

2042
02:14:44,540 --> 02:14:47,640
I did it!

2043
02:14:49,080 --> 02:14:51,040
Okay, refresh to download.

2044
02:14:51,400 --> 02:14:52,220
See more choice.

2045
02:14:52,360 --> 02:14:53,500
Wait, I have episode two.

2046
02:14:54,980 --> 02:14:55,740
Oh wait.

2047
02:14:56,860 --> 02:14:57,340
Continue.

2048
02:14:58,260 --> 02:14:59,340
Where's episode two?

2049
02:15:01,120 --> 02:15:02,240
Oh, there it is.

2050
02:15:03,800 --> 02:15:04,260
Oh, okay.

2051
02:15:04,340 --> 02:15:05,360
I already have episode two.

2052
02:15:05,380 --> 02:15:05,840
Don't worry.

2053
02:15:06,560 --> 02:15:07,840
Okay, how do I skip this?

2054
02:15:09,960 --> 02:15:10,440
Okay.

2055
02:15:13,980 --> 02:15:15,880
Does it go straight to episode two?

2056
02:15:15,880 --> 02:15:16,760
Yeah, there we go.

2057
02:15:16,860 --> 02:15:17,660
Oh my god, thank god.

2058
02:15:17,720 --> 02:15:18,500
I was like...

2059
02:15:18,500 --> 02:15:20,620
I was gonna be a little worried.

2060
02:15:21,020 --> 02:15:23,460
I was gonna be like, okay, wait a minute.

2061
02:15:23,860 --> 02:15:26,520
I thought I downloaded all of it.

2062
02:15:26,620 --> 02:15:27,860
Okay, episode two.

2063
02:15:30,560 --> 02:15:32,320
How many episodes are there?

2064
02:15:40,540 --> 02:15:42,300
I got worried there too.

2065
02:15:50,160 --> 02:15:51,280
There's eight?!

2066
02:15:51,280 --> 02:15:52,560
But what about season one?

2067
02:15:53,580 --> 02:15:54,920
Okay, five for season one.

2068
02:16:00,380 --> 02:16:03,260
I tried everything I could to save her, guys.

2069
02:16:31,660 --> 02:16:34,280
We're gonna get big explody, man.

2070
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:36,380
Things will be fine.

2071
02:16:37,900 --> 02:16:38,700
I believe.

2072
02:16:51,780 --> 02:16:52,680
Yeah, you know what?

2073
02:16:52,720 --> 02:16:53,260
You're right.

2074
02:16:54,840 --> 02:16:57,800
Why we gotta be boring while we're trying to save the world?

2075
02:17:12,140 --> 02:17:12,580
Yeah!

2076
02:17:13,880 --> 02:17:15,120
Yeah!

2077
02:17:16,680 --> 02:17:19,620
If we put enough dynamite, he might die!

2078
02:17:20,300 --> 02:17:22,580
Dynamite solves everything.

2079
02:17:24,320 --> 02:17:25,040
Whoa.

2080
02:17:26,400 --> 02:17:28,560
So many deaths.

2081
02:17:29,380 --> 02:17:32,000
Can't wait to kidnap your kids.

2082
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:32,360
Ow!

2083
02:17:34,340 --> 02:17:35,760
Ow, that stings!

2084
02:17:40,640 --> 02:17:41,440
He knows.

2085
02:17:41,560 --> 02:17:43,120
He heard the new Minecraft update.

2086
02:17:50,690 --> 02:17:51,490
But what do I use?

2087
02:17:52,490 --> 02:17:53,630
Do I set my bow and arrow?

2088
02:17:55,950 --> 02:17:57,210
Do I- Am I looking at Reuben?

2089
02:17:57,330 --> 02:17:58,170
Am I gonna chuck Reuben?

2090
02:17:58,170 --> 02:17:58,210
Reuben?

2091
02:18:00,690 --> 02:18:02,030
Okay, I got a sword.

2092
02:18:09,930 --> 02:18:15,030
If I don't swing, I technically can't miss.

2093
02:18:16,090 --> 02:18:17,610
Okay, maybe the arrow.

2094
02:18:32,060 --> 02:18:33,300
Come on, Reuben.

2095
02:18:34,400 --> 02:18:35,840
Gonna be heroes!

2096
02:18:38,400 --> 02:18:40,740
Yeah, we don't need that ammo, guys.

2097
02:18:40,920 --> 02:18:42,000
We'll just make more.

2098
02:18:45,900 --> 02:18:48,360
Oh my god, it's called Boomtown!

2099
02:18:53,080 --> 02:18:53,700
Okay.

2100
02:18:58,360 --> 02:18:59,860
I can't believe it.

2101
02:18:59,940 --> 02:19:00,400
We're...

2102
02:19:02,060 --> 02:19:06,180
We're fighting- We're going to the birthplace of the Costco, guys.

2103
02:19:10,900 --> 02:19:12,460
Boomtown brings the boom.

2104
02:19:17,770 --> 02:19:21,650
We're going to where they- Their origin story.

2105
02:19:22,070 --> 02:19:23,670
Wait, what the fuck?

2106
02:19:24,910 --> 02:19:26,370
Is that all they do in Boomtown?

2107
02:19:26,470 --> 02:19:27,650
They just throw dynamite?

2108
02:19:27,750 --> 02:19:29,930
Oh my god, this place is perfect.

2109
02:19:29,930 --> 02:19:30,090
Perfect.

2110
02:19:38,350 --> 02:19:40,570
It's practically paradise.

2111
02:19:41,650 --> 02:19:45,030
The oldest anarchy server in Minecraft.

2112
02:20:16,920 --> 02:20:17,720
Wait!

2113
02:20:20,720 --> 02:20:28,600
He just- Yes, you think he's- No, no, he respawns, right, guys?

2114
02:20:28,600 --> 02:20:30,960
Guys, he respawns, right?

2115
02:20:31,720 --> 02:20:34,620
He's gonna- He's gonna respawn, right?

2116
02:20:39,660 --> 02:20:41,280
Wait, this is where I live.

2117
02:20:42,400 --> 02:20:43,800
We're in the old Wild West.

2118
02:20:46,900 --> 02:20:47,280
What?

2119
02:20:47,400 --> 02:20:48,220
What are they doing?

2120
02:20:48,980 --> 02:20:50,480
A griefer!

2121
02:20:51,540 --> 02:20:54,400
Oh my god, oh, they're griefers.

2122
02:20:59,920 --> 02:21:01,920
You're right, this is hardcore mode.

2123
02:21:02,020 --> 02:21:02,820
No respawn.

2124
02:21:08,520 --> 02:21:10,520
Jesus Christ, that's hardcore.

2125
02:21:11,780 --> 02:21:15,940
What happens in Boomtown stays in Boomtown.

2126
02:21:31,500 --> 02:21:35,560
Yeah, adventure mode, hardcore only, no respawn.

2127
02:21:37,360 --> 02:21:37,960
That's right.

2128
02:21:39,100 --> 02:21:41,000
You don't know jack shit, Jesse.

2129
02:21:41,860 --> 02:21:43,320
How do I get out of here?

2130
02:21:43,500 --> 02:21:44,280
Where do I go?

2131
02:21:45,700 --> 02:21:46,920
Do I go backwards?

2132
02:21:48,100 --> 02:21:49,920
You might be wondering how I got here.

2133
02:21:50,480 --> 02:21:51,080
Oh,

2134
02:21:54,380 --> 02:21:54,880
banner wall.

2135
02:21:55,900 --> 02:21:56,500
Boomtown.

2136
02:21:58,600 --> 02:22:01,060
Do all these belong to different griefers?

2137
02:22:11,920 --> 02:22:13,500
It's pretty exciting.

2138
02:22:13,880 --> 02:22:14,780
Yeah, I like it here.

2139
02:22:14,840 --> 02:22:15,720
I wanna live here.

2140
02:22:18,560 --> 02:22:19,320
Yeah,

2141
02:22:23,360 --> 02:22:25,900
the possibility of just dying?

2142
02:22:26,380 --> 02:22:27,140
So exciting.

2143
02:22:28,300 --> 02:22:30,720
And you just never come back?

2144
02:22:40,070 --> 02:22:42,070
I've done this before.

2145
02:22:50,790 --> 02:22:51,770
Oh!

2146
02:22:52,490 --> 02:22:54,150
Oh, it's like a little detector.

2147
02:22:55,190 --> 02:22:56,110
Right here.

2148
02:22:58,190 --> 02:22:59,470
Oh, wait, wait.

2149
02:23:00,010 --> 02:23:00,850
It's here.

2150
02:23:08,170 --> 02:23:09,790
The big boom.

2151
02:23:11,250 --> 02:23:12,670
Oh no, it's a griefer.

2152
02:23:18,930 --> 02:23:19,490
Wait,

2153
02:23:23,330 --> 02:23:24,330
why would you wanna know?

2154
02:23:26,110 --> 02:23:27,370
What did Magnus do?

2155
02:23:36,810 --> 02:23:38,250
Oh, noobs.

2156
02:23:43,730 --> 02:23:45,710
Alright, who wants to help us?

2157
02:23:48,950 --> 02:23:49,630
The crit.

2158
02:23:50,240 --> 02:23:51,430
Sounds complicated.

2159
02:23:52,730 --> 02:23:56,770
Oh, I thought I was gonna make them fight each other.

2160
02:24:09,390 --> 02:24:11,310
Bunch of noobs.

2161
02:24:15,990 --> 02:24:18,750
Every cringe makes me stronger.

2162
02:24:22,150 --> 02:24:23,810
Oh, it hurts.

2163
02:24:25,830 --> 02:24:29,170
I knew this town wasn't perfect.

2164
02:24:29,470 --> 02:24:30,810
There's always one flaw.

2165
02:24:31,770 --> 02:24:33,510
It's inhabited by children.

2166
02:24:38,710 --> 02:24:40,730
I knew it.

2167
02:24:40,850 --> 02:24:41,790
The one flaw.

2168
02:24:41,790 --> 02:24:42,990
The egg.

2169
02:24:50,630 --> 02:24:52,590
That's a chicken egg.

2170
02:25:00,610 --> 02:25:03,070
Get over here.

2171
02:25:03,570 --> 02:25:05,490
That's right, superhero landing.

2172
02:25:05,490 --> 02:25:05,670
Landing.

2173
02:25:11,570 --> 02:25:12,190
Ruben, go!

2174
02:25:12,350 --> 02:25:13,290
Chase after her!

2175
02:25:19,610 --> 02:25:22,190
Alex, what the fuck were you- Axel, what the fuck were you doing?

2176
02:25:22,530 --> 02:25:25,090
Your one job was to get- I got two people!

2177
02:25:30,570 --> 02:25:31,790
Oh my god.

2178
02:25:33,470 --> 02:25:35,670
The one flaw in Boom Town.

2179
02:25:36,690 --> 02:25:39,790
I have children playing mobile Minecraft right now.

2180
02:25:41,950 --> 02:25:43,570
Alright, up I go.

2181
02:25:44,990 --> 02:25:45,930
Up I go.

2182
02:25:51,170 --> 02:25:51,870
Oh.

2183
02:25:56,350 --> 02:25:59,210
It's okay, I can- I died?!

2184
02:26:01,790 --> 02:26:03,250
To be fair, I had no armor.

2185
02:26:03,390 --> 02:26:06,550
I had no armor.

2186
02:26:06,670 --> 02:26:07,990
Okay, that makes sense, guys.

2187
02:26:07,990 --> 02:26:09,850
I was not wearing any armor.

2188
02:26:14,110 --> 02:26:16,350
I don't know, I thought I could take it!

2189
02:26:16,450 --> 02:26:17,990
I take the chicken egg!

2190
02:26:20,590 --> 02:26:22,670
He died with a big boom.

2191
02:26:23,010 --> 02:26:24,930
I thought it would take me five booms!

2192
02:26:27,090 --> 02:26:28,970
And uh, thank you for the super chat!

2193
02:26:29,150 --> 02:26:29,970
Thank you, thank you!

2194
02:26:30,130 --> 02:26:33,150
Five big booms worth a quick time event, VTuber.

2195
02:26:40,210 --> 02:26:41,870
Don't worry, I got this.

2196
02:26:42,010 --> 02:26:42,830
First try.

2197
02:26:45,330 --> 02:26:45,510
What?

2198
02:26:49,410 --> 02:26:52,070
It's the egg's fault, it got me low HP, guys.

2199
02:26:52,890 --> 02:26:54,430
I couldn't take it.

2200
02:26:58,950 --> 02:26:59,530
Yeah.

2201
02:26:59,630 --> 02:27:02,990
Yeah, the chicken egg does just a little bit damage than TNT in comparison.

2202
02:27:07,770 --> 02:27:09,690
Oh, she's just like me.

2203
02:27:10,150 --> 02:27:10,750
Give me that.

2204
02:27:12,290 --> 02:27:13,070
Wait, what happens?

2205
02:27:14,230 --> 02:27:15,370
What happens?

2206
02:27:21,390 --> 02:27:22,290
That's right.

2207
02:27:22,290 --> 02:27:24,010
See, I take that!

2208
02:27:39,540 --> 02:27:41,080
Oh shit, I want that.

2209
02:27:41,280 --> 02:27:42,340
Boink, mine now!

2210
02:27:47,520 --> 02:27:48,980
Oh shit, jump!

2211
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:58,580
Oh shit, wait, how did they know?

2212
02:27:59,540 --> 02:28:00,940
How did they know I was there?

2213
02:28:02,780 --> 02:28:04,460
We just need to get to the spire.

2214
02:28:19,500 --> 02:28:20,700
It's my amulet.

2215
02:28:21,680 --> 02:28:22,200
It's mine.

2216
02:28:26,460 --> 02:28:27,980
It's mine.

2217
02:28:28,200 --> 02:28:28,840
Oh my.

2218
02:28:30,520 --> 02:28:31,600
That's right.

2219
02:28:40,020 --> 02:28:42,240
My precious amulet.

2220
02:28:47,900 --> 02:28:49,160
What's he gonna remember?

2221
02:28:49,240 --> 02:28:50,220
He's not gonna remember shit.

2222
02:28:51,220 --> 02:28:53,340
He knows what his role is.

2223
02:29:00,150 --> 02:29:01,390
See, I'm okay.

2224
02:29:07,120 --> 02:29:09,160
See what he's gonna do, shoot me in the head?

2225
02:29:09,760 --> 02:29:10,740
See, look at that.

2226
02:29:14,180 --> 02:29:15,300
No consequences.

2227
02:29:16,380 --> 02:29:18,960
There's actual no consequences.

2228
02:29:19,160 --> 02:29:20,040
What am I not gonna happen?

2229
02:29:20,180 --> 02:29:20,740
I fall?

2230
02:29:21,300 --> 02:29:21,600
Oh.

2231
02:29:25,520 --> 02:29:27,900
Guys, okay, there's one consequence.

2232
02:29:30,380 --> 02:29:33,000
There's one consequence, apparently.

2233
02:29:36,100 --> 02:29:37,760
Okay, now I know.

2234
02:29:37,920 --> 02:29:39,080
Now I know I fall.

2235
02:29:40,980 --> 02:29:43,020
See, that changes nothing!

2236
02:29:44,080 --> 02:29:46,000
That really changes nothing!

2237
02:29:47,520 --> 02:29:50,880
I still get hit by the arrow.

2238
02:30:00,300 --> 02:30:01,160
I did.

2239
02:30:01,320 --> 02:30:03,300
I pressed all the buttons for you.

2240
02:30:04,960 --> 02:30:05,980
Everything go okay?

2241
02:30:12,200 --> 02:30:14,220
Well, welcome to Tomato Farm!

2242
02:30:14,340 --> 02:30:14,820
Welcome, welcome!

2243
02:30:15,560 --> 02:30:16,400
Yes, I got it.

2244
02:30:31,220 --> 02:30:33,200
Wait, the arrow's still in my knee.

2245
02:30:33,720 --> 02:30:34,780
You think there's consequences?

2246
02:30:35,040 --> 02:30:35,840
There's no way.

2247
02:30:43,280 --> 02:30:45,160
Wait, Reuben, you're better now!

2248
02:30:45,440 --> 02:30:46,320
Your eye's healed!

2249
02:30:47,460 --> 02:30:48,340
Just knock on the door.

2250
02:30:48,480 --> 02:30:49,260
Let me in!

2251
02:30:49,500 --> 02:30:50,260
I'm important!

2252
02:30:56,310 --> 02:30:57,690
Oh, wait, it worked.

2253
02:31:04,300 --> 02:31:05,390
So it seems.

2254
02:31:05,610 --> 02:31:06,470
Let's get in there.

2255
02:31:07,150 --> 02:31:08,230
Right behind you.

2256
02:31:24,380 --> 02:31:26,040
That's a shitty trap.

2257
02:31:27,480 --> 02:31:29,620
Doesn't even lead us directly to lava.

2258
02:31:39,260 --> 02:31:39,960
Magnus?

2259
02:31:56,820 --> 02:31:58,220
What?

2260
02:32:02,280 --> 02:32:04,640
We're not griefers!

2261
02:32:07,040 --> 02:32:07,400
Hey!

2262
02:32:07,900 --> 02:32:09,760
You can't insult him!

2263
02:32:11,800 --> 02:32:13,040
Yeah, I can!

2264
02:32:19,300 --> 02:32:19,560
How?

2265
02:32:19,680 --> 02:32:23,000
He doesn't even have a fucking... the eye shit.

2266
02:32:26,220 --> 02:32:28,060
He's definitely... he's your biggest fan.

2267
02:32:34,180 --> 02:32:35,780
How is that an insult?

2268
02:32:35,780 --> 02:32:40,220
What do you mean, like... what do you...

2269
02:32:41,120 --> 02:32:43,780
I wasn't even insulting him!

2270
02:32:46,840 --> 02:32:47,840
Gabriel sent us.

2271
02:32:49,320 --> 02:32:52,960
He's like, well, I'm not really that big of a fan.

2272
02:32:55,260 --> 02:32:56,280
Did I call him fat?

2273
02:32:56,500 --> 02:32:58,860
Is that... did I accidentally call him fat?

2274
02:33:01,960 --> 02:33:05,820
I just meant he was... you're like... he was his, like, goshi.

2275
02:33:08,820 --> 02:33:09,660
Wait, what's that?

2276
02:33:09,720 --> 02:33:13,460
I accidentally called... I didn't realize that's what it means!

2277
02:33:13,780 --> 02:33:15,020
Oh, shit!

2278
02:33:17,560 --> 02:33:20,340
I didn't... I didn't know!

2279
02:33:20,780 --> 02:33:22,500
I didn't remember!

2280
02:33:23,180 --> 02:33:24,340
I didn't realize!

2281
02:33:25,400 --> 02:33:26,120
Whoops.

2282
02:33:31,300 --> 02:33:32,880
I didn't realize what he said!

2283
02:33:33,280 --> 02:33:34,240
Look at him!

2284
02:33:34,360 --> 02:33:37,560
I thought he was like, yes, he obviously is wearing green.

2285
02:33:37,820 --> 02:33:39,780
I thought it was because he was wearing green!

2286
02:33:45,640 --> 02:33:47,000
I thought you were a hero.

2287
02:33:48,840 --> 02:33:50,080
I thought you were a hero.

2288
02:33:50,080 --> 02:33:50,340
I don't know.

2289
02:33:54,820 --> 02:33:55,520
No!

2290
02:33:56,200 --> 02:33:57,780
Don't remember, Taxel!

2291
02:33:57,840 --> 02:33:59,060
I swear to God!

2292
02:34:00,340 --> 02:34:02,260
That was not taxed!

2293
02:34:11,140 --> 02:34:13,780
I thought it was because he was wearing green!

2294
02:34:16,580 --> 02:34:17,980
I'll just let it ramble.

2295
02:34:20,640 --> 02:34:21,160
Yikes!

2296
02:34:21,680 --> 02:34:23,860
Let's not go down that road.

2297
02:34:26,520 --> 02:34:28,160
Okay, okay, you sold me!

2298
02:34:28,420 --> 02:34:29,700
I didn't say anything!

2299
02:34:35,450 --> 02:34:37,330
I didn't say anything!

2300
02:34:37,590 --> 02:34:41,770
Oh, but we might have a little bit of a problem getting out of here.

2301
02:34:42,190 --> 02:34:42,190
Huh?

2302
02:34:43,990 --> 02:34:45,290
You're Magnus.

2303
02:34:45,650 --> 02:34:46,470
You can just walk out of here.

2304
02:34:46,470 --> 02:34:48,270
Yeah, but why did all the griefers want to kill him?

2305
02:34:48,270 --> 02:34:53,910
I don't know if you've looked around this place, but it's kind of full of griefers.

2306
02:34:55,470 --> 02:34:57,470
But that's kind of awesome, right?

2307
02:34:57,570 --> 02:34:58,270
Yeah, isn't that great?

2308
02:34:58,510 --> 02:34:58,950
Anarchy.

2309
02:34:59,190 --> 02:35:02,250
You've heard about the whole challenging the king for his crown thing, right?

2310
02:35:02,510 --> 02:35:03,750
That's why I want to kill him.

2311
02:35:05,090 --> 02:35:08,750
So long as I'm king, I can't leave this town.

2312
02:35:09,930 --> 02:35:11,890
But you're king, you just make new rules.

2313
02:35:12,090 --> 02:35:12,950
No, you don't!

2314
02:35:13,350 --> 02:35:14,390
They're no match for you!

2315
02:35:14,530 --> 02:35:15,750
Take them all down!

2316
02:35:15,750 --> 02:35:16,710
No one can beat you.

2317
02:35:18,030 --> 02:35:19,510
And that's the problem.

2318
02:35:21,990 --> 02:35:26,070
Simply put, that's life as king of Boomtown.

2319
02:35:28,430 --> 02:35:31,370
Not as fun as you'd think.

2320
02:35:31,690 --> 02:35:32,610
Choose a new king.

2321
02:35:32,950 --> 02:35:35,530
I do get to spit on their heads occasionally, so I guess that's something.

2322
02:35:35,950 --> 02:35:37,350
Just choose a new king and then have fun.

2323
02:35:37,830 --> 02:35:40,330
You can't just choose a new king, Doki!

2324
02:35:41,070 --> 02:35:43,270
I've beaten them dozens of times.

2325
02:35:43,550 --> 02:35:44,570
And none are worthy!

2326
02:35:44,570 --> 02:35:46,710
They'll see right through it.

2327
02:35:47,430 --> 02:35:51,390
But you, you're the newcomer with the golden amulet.

2328
02:35:51,830 --> 02:35:55,210
By now there'll probably be all sorts of rumors about how awesome you are.

2329
02:35:56,030 --> 02:35:58,850
If you beat me, then I'll be able to leave.

2330
02:36:00,110 --> 02:36:02,610
Can't believe I didn't think of it before!

2331
02:36:02,650 --> 02:36:04,250
Wait, how do I beat you though?

2332
02:36:04,450 --> 02:36:06,550
How would I ever beat you?

2333
02:36:06,830 --> 02:36:07,870
I know, right?

2334
02:36:08,230 --> 02:36:09,250
But that's just it.

2335
02:36:09,610 --> 02:36:10,190
You won't have to.

2336
02:36:10,710 --> 02:36:11,950
I'm faking it!

2337
02:36:12,330 --> 02:36:14,110
Just like on Moonland!

2338
02:36:25,310 --> 02:36:26,710
What?

2339
02:36:44,510 --> 02:36:46,650
Death Ball!

2340
02:36:46,990 --> 02:36:47,850
Death Ball!

2341
02:37:02,450 --> 02:37:03,850
Love!

2342
02:37:08,550 --> 02:37:10,330
I'll graze you!

2343
02:37:10,750 --> 02:37:11,210
Okay!

2344
02:37:13,510 --> 02:37:14,690
I'll graze you with TNT.

2345
02:37:14,770 --> 02:37:18,270
Oh my god, yeah, let's do it!

2346
02:37:18,490 --> 02:37:19,490
Fuck it, let's wing it!

2347
02:37:20,230 --> 02:37:21,890
There's too many choices, guys!

2348
02:37:22,150 --> 02:37:22,790
I didn't know!

2349
02:37:24,910 --> 02:37:26,250
There's so many choices!

2350
02:37:26,410 --> 02:37:27,290
They were all great!

2351
02:37:29,370 --> 02:37:30,690
The Ocelot Slayer.

2352
02:37:34,330 --> 02:37:34,990
That's right.

2353
02:37:35,950 --> 02:37:36,970
You hear that, Lucas?

2354
02:37:37,250 --> 02:37:38,290
Fuck you!

2355
02:37:38,290 --> 02:37:39,610
You heard the name, folks.

2356
02:37:40,070 --> 02:37:46,350
Even if you're not here, I'm still gonna fuck with you.

2357
02:37:53,450 --> 02:37:58,370
Opponents will craft their own griefing towers, which they will then use to grief each other.

2358
02:38:00,070 --> 02:38:01,290
The only rule is...

2359
02:38:01,290 --> 02:38:02,950
That there are no rules!

2360
02:38:04,830 --> 02:38:05,710
No eye poking!

2361
02:38:06,690 --> 02:38:09,130
Other than that, go crazy!

2362
02:38:09,970 --> 02:38:10,470
Seriously.

2363
02:38:12,330 --> 02:38:13,370
Ocelot Slayer!

2364
02:38:13,390 --> 02:38:13,770
That's me!

2365
02:38:15,290 --> 02:38:17,950
Nah, I'm good.

2366
02:38:18,290 --> 02:38:19,430
Brought my own supply.

2367
02:38:20,690 --> 02:38:22,630
Let the griefing begin!

2368
02:38:22,630 --> 02:38:23,930
Wait, who's checking his supply?

2369
02:38:26,450 --> 02:38:27,850
Okay, what do I want?

2370
02:38:28,830 --> 02:38:29,430
Pink wool?

2371
02:38:33,930 --> 02:38:34,530
What?

2372
02:38:36,470 --> 02:38:37,710
I want pink wool.

2373
02:38:37,710 --> 02:38:39,130
Pink wool it is!

2374
02:38:42,210 --> 02:38:46,630
The least explosive material, guys.

2375
02:38:47,110 --> 02:38:48,130
Pink wool!

2376
02:38:50,530 --> 02:38:51,690
Not bad.

2377
02:38:52,390 --> 02:38:53,250
Not bad.

2378
02:38:53,430 --> 02:38:54,250
Guess it'll have to do.

2379
02:38:54,330 --> 02:38:55,230
It's very threatening.

2380
02:38:56,090 --> 02:38:58,630
Axel, what are you doing over there on his side?

2381
02:38:59,170 --> 02:39:01,170
Yeah, thought you might bring that up.

2382
02:39:01,170 --> 02:39:08,250
It's just that Ruben wanted to take your corner, and I didn't want to crowd him or anything, so I thought I'd watch from over here.

2383
02:39:08,370 --> 02:39:09,650
He doesn't trust me!

2384
02:39:09,850 --> 02:39:11,530
After everything I did!

2385
02:39:11,770 --> 02:39:13,750
And I totally didn't fat shame him.

2386
02:39:13,950 --> 02:39:17,610
I thought it was because he was wearing green, guys!

2387
02:39:20,650 --> 02:39:21,910
Get out of here.

2388
02:39:23,870 --> 02:39:24,970
I knew it!

2389
02:39:34,710 --> 02:39:36,130
That's right.

2390
02:39:36,130 --> 02:39:37,280
Fuck you!

2391
02:39:45,870 --> 02:39:47,050
Yeah!

2392
02:39:51,410 --> 02:39:52,470
Pussy!

2393
02:39:54,590 --> 02:39:55,950
Oh my god!

2394
02:39:57,830 --> 02:39:58,990
Wait!

2395
02:39:59,570 --> 02:40:00,990
That chick is dead!

2396
02:40:04,170 --> 02:40:04,810
Oh!

2397
02:40:17,170 --> 02:40:20,450
I need a time to look down!

2398
02:40:21,850 --> 02:40:26,410
The tactical pause!

2399
02:40:29,370 --> 02:40:30,130
Pause!

2400
02:40:33,410 --> 02:40:34,170
Okay.

2401
02:40:34,810 --> 02:40:35,690
Holding the lever.

2402
02:40:35,890 --> 02:40:36,570
My turn!

2403
02:40:37,950 --> 02:40:39,130
Oh shit!

2404
02:40:39,270 --> 02:40:41,270
He can do that?!

2405
02:40:42,370 --> 02:40:44,410
You can do that?!

2406
02:40:49,070 --> 02:40:53,790
Oh, now you're on my side!

2407
02:40:59,150 --> 02:40:59,570
Wait.

2408
02:40:59,570 --> 02:41:00,830
What about the plan?

2409
02:41:06,510 --> 02:41:12,150
Oh, I thought he was going to say it out loud!

2410
02:41:12,350 --> 02:41:15,010
I wanted everyone to be like, what do you mean, plan?

2411
02:41:22,330 --> 02:41:23,950
Guys, you gotta make it look real!

2412
02:41:29,230 --> 02:41:31,230
Guys, he's just trying to make it look real!

2413
02:41:37,710 --> 02:41:39,210
What do I have?

2414
02:41:44,890 --> 02:41:45,870
Oh, okay.

2415
02:41:46,390 --> 02:41:47,490
Let's put some rocks here.

2416
02:41:47,990 --> 02:41:48,810
What am I making?

2417
02:41:52,070 --> 02:41:56,150
How would that... I have a square-shaped hole!

2418
02:42:01,190 --> 02:42:02,990
What the fuck?

2419
02:42:06,910 --> 02:42:08,110
Oh shit!

2420
02:42:09,430 --> 02:42:11,350
It goes in the squirrel!

2421
02:42:13,510 --> 02:42:14,250
It's okay.

2422
02:42:14,390 --> 02:42:14,990
I dodged!

2423
02:42:15,050 --> 02:42:15,450
Guys, look!

2424
02:42:15,490 --> 02:42:16,010
I did it!

2425
02:42:16,690 --> 02:42:18,690
I had a feeling I would actually die!

2426
02:42:25,700 --> 02:42:26,980
What's Ruben gonna do?

2427
02:42:30,360 --> 02:42:31,300
Oh shit!

2428
02:42:41,080 --> 02:42:42,800
I look really cool!

2429
02:42:51,860 --> 02:42:55,900
Yeah, I have this part of your animal that's gonna fuck you up!

2430
02:42:58,060 --> 02:42:59,120
A bow and arrow?

2431
02:43:09,880 --> 02:43:13,540
I light it with the lava!

2432
02:43:17,300 --> 02:43:17,940
Ruben!

2433
02:43:22,140 --> 02:43:23,420
Axel, get him!

2434
02:43:28,360 --> 02:43:31,280
What if I just shoot him?

2435
02:43:44,760 --> 02:43:46,460
Look at that!

2436
02:43:46,660 --> 02:43:47,320
Slow-mo!

2437
02:43:48,420 --> 02:43:48,860
Oh shit!

2438
02:43:51,520 --> 02:43:52,880
Oh shit!

2439
02:43:56,320 --> 02:43:57,960
Where's my 360?

2440
02:43:58,500 --> 02:44:00,800
Oh, he's dead-dead.

2441
02:44:09,620 --> 02:44:14,220
It would be funny if Magnus just dies and then it's like...

2442
02:44:15,400 --> 02:44:18,880
We accidentally just kill someone in the order.

2443
02:44:26,620 --> 02:44:27,520
That's me!

2444
02:44:27,920 --> 02:44:28,540
Yippee!

2445
02:44:29,280 --> 02:44:30,180
I'm a hero!

2446
02:44:35,700 --> 02:44:38,620
Hello, Boomtown!

2447
02:44:48,720 --> 02:44:49,820
That's right!

2448
02:44:58,540 --> 02:45:02,340
Now they're like, thank God!

2449
02:45:05,400 --> 02:45:07,160
I am now the new-oh!

2450
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:18,620
Just throw a dynamite at it!

2451
02:45:18,960 --> 02:45:20,940
I guess he dies.

2452
02:45:24,920 --> 02:45:27,300
Alright, rest in peace Boomtown!

2453
02:45:28,640 --> 02:45:29,260
Goodbye!

2454
02:45:37,460 --> 02:45:39,320
Is he gonna-is he gonna get hit?

2455
02:45:47,060 --> 02:45:50,340
Bye, Radimuses that were gonna kill me!

2456
02:45:51,220 --> 02:45:53,620
I feel so sorry for you.

2457
02:45:54,920 --> 02:45:57,620
Oh, Boomtown went boom!

2458
02:45:59,440 --> 02:46:00,280
No!

2459
02:46:12,460 --> 02:46:14,620
Did I make that?

2460
02:46:15,560 --> 02:46:16,840
Who made that?

2461
02:46:25,340 --> 02:46:26,120
Oh, Lucas!

2462
02:46:26,340 --> 02:46:27,400
You made that?

2463
02:46:27,860 --> 02:46:29,460
Wait, did you build all this?

2464
02:46:34,020 --> 02:46:35,020
Guys, see?

2465
02:46:35,680 --> 02:46:38,600
I told you keeping Lucas around was a good idea.

2466
02:46:40,520 --> 02:46:43,000
Olivia could never do something like this.

2467
02:46:43,260 --> 02:46:44,680
I forgot he was a builder.

2468
02:46:44,840 --> 02:46:45,660
Wait, I gotta use the bathroom.

2469
02:46:46,180 --> 02:46:52,680
I'm worried that, like, if I leave it running while I use the bathroom, I'm gonna make a hundred million choices and I don't know what happens.

2470
02:46:53,040 --> 02:46:54,240
So, I'll be right back!

2471
02:48:11,400 --> 02:48:15,760
Alright, let me double check something real quick.

2472
02:48:16,640 --> 02:48:17,280
Alright.

2473
02:48:18,580 --> 02:48:20,640
Let us keep playing, as in play.

2474
02:48:20,780 --> 02:48:23,260
Let's just keep watching.

2475
02:48:23,980 --> 02:48:26,140
I got my Costco tacos too.

2476
02:48:26,240 --> 02:48:29,120
My Costco chicken tacos, if you know what I mean.

2477
02:48:29,400 --> 02:48:29,780
Gabriel!

2478
02:48:30,440 --> 02:48:31,060
Gabriel!

2479
02:48:36,940 --> 02:48:38,020
He's back!

2480
02:48:38,520 --> 02:48:40,660
Coyote, Johnny, Flo, thank you for the superchat.

2481
02:48:40,720 --> 02:48:41,560
Thank you.

2482
02:48:48,800 --> 02:48:49,720
See, guys?

2483
02:48:50,360 --> 02:48:52,140
I saved the real hero.

2484
02:48:55,680 --> 02:48:57,520
I saved the right person.

2485
02:49:00,880 --> 02:49:01,740
Wait, how did you escape?

2486
02:49:04,840 --> 02:49:05,560
Yeah!

2487
02:49:11,840 --> 02:49:13,140
See, guys?

2488
02:49:14,960 --> 02:49:16,560
He would've been dead!

2489
02:49:25,240 --> 02:49:25,780
Oh, shit.

2490
02:49:27,400 --> 02:49:28,820
Yeah, anyone else live?

2491
02:49:36,920 --> 02:49:38,300
No, she's fine.

2492
02:49:38,380 --> 02:49:38,880
She's fine.

2493
02:49:38,960 --> 02:49:39,480
He's lying.

2494
02:49:42,760 --> 02:49:43,880
There's no way.

2495
02:49:44,160 --> 02:49:44,940
He's lying.

2496
02:49:54,760 --> 02:49:55,940
There's no way!

2497
02:49:56,300 --> 02:49:57,460
He's lying, guys!

2498
02:50:01,660 --> 02:50:04,540
Actions don't have consequences in my Telltale game.

2499
02:50:12,530 --> 02:50:15,030
Oh, she found him?

2500
02:50:35,610 --> 02:50:37,370
Isn't that Elgar the engineer?

2501
02:50:38,190 --> 02:50:39,230
Yeah, what's wrong with her?

2502
02:50:40,470 --> 02:50:42,450
It's Elgar the redstone engineer.

2503
02:50:44,690 --> 02:50:48,450
Well, if you're such a big fan, then why don't you go hang out with her then?

2504
02:50:49,070 --> 02:50:49,390
Jesse!

2505
02:50:49,650 --> 02:50:49,910
Jesse!

2506
02:50:50,290 --> 02:50:50,750
Look!

2507
02:50:51,070 --> 02:50:52,030
I found Elgar!

2508
02:50:52,530 --> 02:50:54,350
Just hang on a sec, okay?

2509
02:50:54,930 --> 02:50:56,550
I'll go figure out what's going on.

2510
02:50:56,650 --> 02:50:58,070
Good, you do that.

2511
02:50:58,190 --> 02:51:00,370
Look, redstones are for nerds, okay?

2512
02:51:01,510 --> 02:51:06,290
Why come up with all this technology when I can just throw a dynamite at it?

2513
02:51:06,390 --> 02:51:07,050
Who are you now?

2514
02:51:07,670 --> 02:51:09,670
And why did you bring him with you?

2515
02:51:12,030 --> 02:51:13,230
We're reuniting.

2516
02:51:13,630 --> 02:51:15,110
Magnus is awesome.

2517
02:51:20,310 --> 02:51:21,630
He's just awesome.

2518
02:51:23,390 --> 02:51:27,910
I could give a real accent, but it's them like, bro, Magnus is awesome.

2519
02:51:34,670 --> 02:51:38,230
Who needs inventions when I can throw a bomb at it?

2520
02:51:40,270 --> 02:51:41,350
Everything explodes.

2521
02:51:41,490 --> 02:51:42,710
I'm the king of Boomtown.

2522
02:51:51,670 --> 02:51:52,990
Yeah, I'm king.

2523
02:51:53,070 --> 02:51:53,850
What are you, Olivia?

2524
02:51:54,530 --> 02:51:56,550
Not even the queen of Redstone Town.

2525
02:52:09,310 --> 02:52:10,270
Hello, Magnus.

2526
02:52:10,610 --> 02:52:13,010
Your voice is exactly as pleasant as I remember.

2527
02:52:13,630 --> 02:52:15,690
Which is to say, not at all.

2528
02:52:16,090 --> 02:52:17,650
Oh, my feelings.

2529
02:52:18,230 --> 02:52:20,850
Is that the same wit you're going to use to save the world?

2530
02:52:21,430 --> 02:52:21,790
Why?

2531
02:52:22,030 --> 02:52:23,390
You here to tell me how to do it better?

2532
02:52:24,030 --> 02:52:26,410
Oh, I would never dream of doing that.

2533
02:52:26,970 --> 02:52:30,750
Unlike you, I actually do things instead of just talking.

2534
02:52:31,830 --> 02:52:33,810
Hey, that's enough of what you're talking about.

2535
02:52:34,470 --> 02:52:35,570
Show her some respect.

2536
02:52:36,170 --> 02:52:39,450
Wow, you finally found yourself a live one.

2537
02:52:39,950 --> 02:52:44,230
Hey, your little devotees are usually a little more on the bookish side.

2538
02:52:44,390 --> 02:52:45,770
Leave that to Magnus.

2539
02:52:46,030 --> 02:52:47,310
This is between the two of us.

2540
02:52:47,710 --> 02:52:49,730
Oh, I started worrying.

2541
02:52:50,830 --> 02:52:53,610
You're just a big hothead stomping in here.

2542
02:52:53,810 --> 02:52:54,510
Easy there, Olivia.

2543
02:52:54,910 --> 02:52:58,250
He's a pain in the butt, but he's still an old acquaintance.

2544
02:52:59,230 --> 02:53:02,110
People, can we please focus on the bigger picture?

2545
02:53:02,110 --> 02:53:07,790
We have a very hungry Witherstorm in the process of turning the whole world into its dinner.

2546
02:53:08,130 --> 02:53:09,690
Guys, did you forget the world's ending?

2547
02:53:10,610 --> 02:53:11,970
That thing looked real nasty.

2548
02:53:12,550 --> 02:53:15,270
And I've seen some nasty stuff in my time.

2549
02:53:15,950 --> 02:53:16,950
Too much for you, was it?

2550
02:53:17,230 --> 02:53:19,250
Your usual brutish approach didn't cut it.

2551
02:53:19,910 --> 02:53:23,150
Wait, why did it go after Boomtown and not Redstone City?

2552
02:53:23,810 --> 02:53:24,950
That's fucked up.

2553
02:53:46,670 --> 02:53:47,190
Fuck!

2554
02:53:47,210 --> 02:53:51,090
That's so fucked up.

2555
02:53:51,170 --> 02:53:52,450
Boomtown's already going through it.

2556
02:53:53,090 --> 02:53:54,830
It did not need more destroying.

2557
02:54:00,270 --> 02:54:01,690
So what are you gonna do?

2558
02:54:01,970 --> 02:54:03,210
Wait, I thought you were heroes.

2559
02:54:03,430 --> 02:54:03,670
Yeah.

2560
02:54:12,330 --> 02:54:17,130
No, you're supposed to know right away what to do.

2561
02:54:17,850 --> 02:54:19,230
I put you on a pedestal.

2562
02:54:19,230 --> 02:54:22,310
So all my expectations will never be matched.

2563
02:54:35,950 --> 02:54:38,850
Wait, something that can be stronger than TNT?

2564
02:54:39,850 --> 02:54:41,170
That's possible?

2565
02:54:49,330 --> 02:54:52,670
Wait, he's not the TNT- oh my god, a nuke?

2566
02:55:00,970 --> 02:55:02,910
The F-bomb.

2567
02:55:08,070 --> 02:55:10,210
F-bomb, okay.

2568
02:55:11,590 --> 02:55:13,150
The fuck-bomb.

2569
02:55:16,170 --> 02:55:16,770
Okay.

2570
02:55:17,510 --> 02:55:20,170
Yeah, if I found Elegard too.

2571
02:55:21,810 --> 02:55:24,450
Not the F-bomb, she says naturally.

2572
02:55:30,160 --> 02:55:33,040
Not the F-bomb in my fucking Minecraft game.

2573
02:55:39,300 --> 02:55:40,860
Wait, he wasn't on the map.

2574
02:55:42,540 --> 02:55:43,960
Yeah, how do we find him?

2575
02:55:45,180 --> 02:55:46,300
Is he in the nether?

2576
02:55:46,900 --> 02:55:48,360
He has to be in the nether, right?

2577
02:55:49,940 --> 02:55:52,660
That's why he's not on the map, because this doesn't show the nether.

2578
02:55:56,530 --> 02:55:57,970
Like, where else would it be?

2579
02:55:58,290 --> 02:55:58,730
Oh no.

2580
02:55:59,690 --> 02:56:03,050
Okay, let me finesse my hat underneath the tray.

2581
02:56:06,150 --> 02:56:07,770
Sorry for my eating ASMR.

2582
02:56:12,650 --> 02:56:13,050
Hey.

2583
02:56:19,590 --> 02:56:21,010
See, I told you!

2584
02:56:21,130 --> 02:56:22,210
You're his biggest fan!

2585
02:56:25,290 --> 02:56:27,130
You were like, I'm not that tall.

2586
02:56:36,410 --> 02:56:43,350
Hey, what is Elegard?

2587
02:56:43,410 --> 02:56:44,350
I've never talked to her before.

2588
02:56:51,930 --> 02:56:54,570
Did not activate- I don't remember how to activate it.

2589
02:56:55,430 --> 02:56:56,350
What did I do?

2590
02:57:03,650 --> 02:57:06,990
All your friends are dead, but you're doing great.

2591
02:57:08,510 --> 02:57:09,950
Keep it together.

2592
02:57:11,230 --> 02:57:11,490
Okay?

2593
02:57:13,010 --> 02:57:14,230
I need you here.

2594
02:57:14,610 --> 02:57:16,250
I need the drama in my life.

2595
02:57:19,010 --> 02:57:20,630
Don't worry, you're strong.

2596
02:57:20,750 --> 02:57:21,930
I believe in you.

2597
02:57:23,630 --> 02:57:25,170
Okay, we put this on.

2598
02:57:26,230 --> 02:57:28,670
I should not have to do the switches, right?

2599
02:57:30,010 --> 02:57:30,830
Oh no.

2600
02:57:32,050 --> 02:57:34,790
Oh no, guys, I don't...

2601
02:57:34,790 --> 02:57:37,470
I don't remember the switches.

2602
02:57:38,210 --> 02:57:38,590
Okay.

2603
02:57:39,590 --> 02:57:41,450
Okay, wait, no, I don't!

2604
02:57:41,910 --> 02:57:43,090
It's already turned on!

2605
02:57:46,210 --> 02:57:46,730
What?

2606
02:57:46,730 --> 02:57:46,990
Okay, nice.

2607
02:57:47,070 --> 02:57:48,230
I just need to turn one button.

2608
02:57:55,650 --> 02:57:56,170
What?

2609
02:58:03,110 --> 02:58:03,630
Wait,

2610
02:58:08,150 --> 02:58:08,410
what?

2611
02:58:08,410 --> 02:58:08,490
What?

2612
02:58:10,010 --> 02:58:12,470
How did he show up?

2613
02:58:17,250 --> 02:58:19,170
Wait, what's the problem?

2614
02:58:19,390 --> 02:58:19,590
Yeah.

2615
02:58:22,090 --> 02:58:22,350
Yeah.

2616
02:58:22,910 --> 02:58:24,010
Oh shit.

2617
02:58:28,410 --> 02:58:28,670
What?

2618
02:58:33,340 --> 02:58:34,050
Who's that?

2619
02:58:35,650 --> 02:58:36,690
Is that Ivor?

2620
02:58:37,650 --> 02:58:37,990
Ivor?

2621
02:58:38,530 --> 02:58:39,690
Sorry, I...

2622
02:58:42,370 --> 02:58:46,690
Sorry, I didn't realize his name is Ivor.

2623
02:58:57,770 --> 02:58:58,450
Well,

2624
02:59:02,650 --> 02:59:03,650
just bring torches!

2625
02:59:03,890 --> 02:59:05,090
Now we should go now!

2626
02:59:08,230 --> 02:59:09,530
Well, just bring torches!

2627
02:59:09,830 --> 02:59:10,950
What's the worst that could happen?

2628
02:59:18,550 --> 02:59:20,190
I trust the boom guy.

2629
02:59:21,850 --> 02:59:22,810
He doesn't need a degree.

2630
02:59:23,410 --> 02:59:24,570
He has street smart.

2631
02:59:24,690 --> 02:59:27,210
We don't need a master's degree to figure this out.

2632
02:59:38,140 --> 02:59:39,640
We just have torches, right?

2633
02:59:40,680 --> 02:59:41,840
Guys, where's our torches?

2634
02:59:43,320 --> 02:59:43,980
Guys?

2635
02:59:46,000 --> 02:59:47,660
Where's our torches, guys?

2636
02:59:51,360 --> 02:59:59,780
Yeah, I'm pretty fucking tough.

2637
03:00:02,940 --> 03:00:03,600
Yeah, that's me.

2638
03:00:06,620 --> 03:00:08,500
I think that's hot.

2639
03:00:16,340 --> 03:00:16,980
What?

2640
03:00:21,260 --> 03:00:21,900
Whoa!

2641
03:00:26,580 --> 03:00:28,080
Yeah, she's kind of...

2642
03:00:28,720 --> 03:00:30,220
Why do I just throw a defender?

2643
03:00:43,920 --> 03:00:45,760
I want it!

2644
03:00:47,020 --> 03:00:48,100
What if I don't?

2645
03:00:48,320 --> 03:00:48,780
Let her...

2646
03:00:49,560 --> 03:00:50,760
Let her overthink.

2647
03:00:56,720 --> 03:00:59,160
Now she's gonna overthink this forever.

2648
03:01:00,680 --> 03:01:02,820
Now she'll never know.

2649
03:01:09,540 --> 03:01:12,880
She's gonna overthink this and be like, isn't me?

2650
03:01:13,580 --> 03:01:14,780
Now she's insecure.

2651
03:01:14,780 --> 03:01:15,120
Yeah.

2652
03:01:26,640 --> 03:01:34,020
I told you guys we should have brought torches.

2653
03:01:40,510 --> 03:01:42,290
Get over here.

2654
03:01:44,390 --> 03:01:44,730
Okay.

2655
03:01:45,990 --> 03:01:47,570
I got this, guys.

2656
03:01:49,030 --> 03:01:49,430
Boom!

2657
03:01:49,740 --> 03:01:50,750
Oh, fuck!

2658
03:01:51,970 --> 03:01:53,030
Boom!

2659
03:01:54,770 --> 03:01:55,650
There we go.

2660
03:01:55,850 --> 03:01:56,450
We did it.

2661
03:01:58,720 --> 03:01:59,910
Look at him go!

2662
03:02:03,860 --> 03:02:05,130
We got this!

2663
03:02:06,310 --> 03:02:06,870
Boom!

2664
03:02:14,390 --> 03:02:16,950
What a badass.

2665
03:02:25,630 --> 03:02:27,150
God, I'm such a gamer.

2666
03:02:28,630 --> 03:02:37,530
Guys, do you think the final battle is gonna be like Mass Effect where my choices matter and if I piss off everybody, I'm just gonna solo it?

2667
03:02:38,390 --> 03:02:39,610
There's no way, right?

2668
03:02:39,710 --> 03:02:41,530
My choices don't matter, right?

2669
03:02:41,670 --> 03:02:43,350
My actions don't have consequences.

2670
03:02:49,550 --> 03:02:49,990
Nah.

2671
03:03:04,330 --> 03:03:04,970
Sorin?

2672
03:03:05,150 --> 03:03:05,950
Are you here?

2673
03:03:07,690 --> 03:03:10,270
We're here for the F-bomb.

2674
03:03:14,450 --> 03:03:20,550
I knew getting Magnus here was a good idea.

2675
03:03:26,050 --> 03:03:27,470
He's so healthy.

2676
03:03:35,210 --> 03:03:36,170
Oh, shit.

2677
03:03:38,050 --> 03:03:38,650
Oh!

2678
03:03:39,310 --> 03:03:40,710
Wait, that can happen?

2679
03:03:42,970 --> 03:03:44,610
Oh, my God, Enderman!

2680
03:03:46,350 --> 03:03:47,830
I thought I was eating my taco.

2681
03:03:50,630 --> 03:03:51,230
Oh,

2682
03:03:55,530 --> 03:03:55,990
hey, Lucas!

2683
03:03:58,310 --> 03:04:00,570
Hey, we're too alone to get there.

2684
03:04:02,010 --> 03:04:04,270
I didn't think they ever came in groups that big.

2685
03:04:07,890 --> 03:04:09,330
Wait, thanks for coming back.

2686
03:04:09,410 --> 03:04:10,330
Yeah, where are the others?

2687
03:04:10,490 --> 03:04:11,390
Wait, actually...

2688
03:04:11,910 --> 03:04:13,070
They left me to die?

2689
03:04:13,590 --> 03:04:15,090
Oh, they thought I was ahead?

2690
03:04:18,630 --> 03:04:20,050
Oh, I didn't think I was ahead!

2691
03:04:20,090 --> 03:04:21,210
I was behind them!

2692
03:04:24,890 --> 03:04:25,290
Okay.

2693
03:04:26,110 --> 03:04:28,290
Wait, if he grabs me, will I just hit two feet out?

2694
03:04:29,870 --> 03:04:32,210
Yeah, there's no way he'll hit me, right?

2695
03:04:32,910 --> 03:04:34,110
Oh, wait, they don't like water.

2696
03:04:37,530 --> 03:04:37,990
Ruben!

2697
03:04:38,170 --> 03:04:38,950
Jump, Ruben!

2698
03:04:41,550 --> 03:04:43,950
They don't care about pigs, but jump anyway!

2699
03:04:44,570 --> 03:04:46,830
I need you to drown with me.

2700
03:04:47,430 --> 03:04:48,450
Just like the Egyptians.

2701
03:04:54,060 --> 03:04:55,040
Oh, it's right here.

2702
03:05:06,790 --> 03:05:07,430
What?

2703
03:05:13,330 --> 03:05:14,330
Wait, what?

2704
03:05:18,850 --> 03:05:19,810
Why are they angry?

2705
03:05:25,870 --> 03:05:28,310
Oh, they're searching on both sides!

2706
03:05:28,750 --> 03:05:31,410
Wouldn't it be in the one where the white area is?

2707
03:05:31,650 --> 03:05:32,450
For Soren?

2708
03:05:36,810 --> 03:05:38,390
Yeah, they like to fight a lot.

2709
03:05:40,030 --> 03:05:42,290
Yeah, they're like an old married couple.

2710
03:05:45,310 --> 03:05:47,110
I bet you they'll hook up later.

2711
03:05:49,910 --> 03:05:50,790
They have history.

2712
03:05:52,170 --> 03:05:53,070
You can tell.

2713
03:05:55,890 --> 03:05:57,130
Where's the one that's white?

2714
03:06:03,860 --> 03:06:04,340
Blue...

2715
03:06:04,340 --> 03:06:07,300
Oh, I have to open all of them, maybe?

2716
03:06:13,980 --> 03:06:15,760
Talk to me.

2717
03:06:18,340 --> 03:06:19,520
Wait, what happened, Gabriel?

2718
03:06:20,420 --> 03:06:21,360
Wait, why are you sick?

2719
03:06:27,320 --> 03:06:29,000
Yeah, what happened?

2720
03:06:30,980 --> 03:06:32,240
Did you get bit?

2721
03:06:33,100 --> 03:06:34,620
Oh my god, he got

2722
03:06:41,650 --> 03:06:42,050
you!

2723
03:06:42,350 --> 03:06:43,750
He's one of those!

2724
03:06:44,450 --> 03:06:46,710
He doesn't tell you when he gets bit!

2725
03:06:50,770 --> 03:06:54,310
Oh my god, it's the Walking Dead all over again!

2726
03:06:57,750 --> 03:06:59,330
He's one of them!

2727
03:07:00,310 --> 03:07:01,910
Not again, Lee!

2728
03:07:10,760 --> 03:07:12,540
Toki will remember that.

2729
03:07:12,660 --> 03:07:14,100
I'm gonna remember that.

2730
03:07:17,900 --> 03:07:20,040
Wait, is this actually Lee's voice acting?

2731
03:07:20,340 --> 03:07:21,560
That's so funny!

2732
03:07:26,100 --> 03:07:33,220
I would absolutely not endanger the group, guys.

2733
03:07:36,960 --> 03:07:38,420
I would never!

2734
03:07:41,920 --> 03:07:43,880
I can't believe it!

2735
03:07:45,740 --> 03:07:48,500
I can't believe he didn't talk!

2736
03:07:49,480 --> 03:07:51,920
Alright, let's go get Magnus.

2737
03:07:56,800 --> 03:07:57,360
Wait, what?

2738
03:07:58,820 --> 03:08:00,000
Okay, who do we follow?

2739
03:08:00,040 --> 03:08:01,420
Oh, you know how we followed Magnus.

2740
03:08:02,180 --> 03:08:03,720
Leave no man behind.

2741
03:08:20,340 --> 03:08:26,160
Oh my god, he's gonna tell me.

2742
03:08:31,960 --> 03:08:33,140
He's gonna turn!

2743
03:08:36,200 --> 03:08:43,000
I'm aware that letting them head off alone is risky, but I need to talk to you about a private matter.

2744
03:08:43,400 --> 03:08:45,640
It's not the easiest thing to bring up.

2745
03:08:45,720 --> 03:08:47,540
I can't believe it!

2746
03:08:48,320 --> 03:08:49,660
I don't want to worry the others.

2747
03:08:50,080 --> 03:08:52,040
Okay, whatever it is, I trust you.

2748
03:08:52,320 --> 03:08:53,220
You can tell me.

2749
03:08:54,400 --> 03:08:55,520
Yeah, you fucking traitor.

2750
03:08:55,820 --> 03:08:57,080
Thank you for being so understanding.

2751
03:08:57,920 --> 03:08:58,900
People remember that.

2752
03:08:59,020 --> 03:09:01,480
I'm so glad to see my old friends together again.

2753
03:09:02,480 --> 03:09:05,040
He's gonna remember that before he dies.

2754
03:09:16,340 --> 03:09:17,320
What?

2755
03:09:21,390 --> 03:09:22,200
What is that?

2756
03:09:33,820 --> 03:09:34,780
Wither sickness?

2757
03:09:40,820 --> 03:09:43,220
Yeah, I was like, what's the difference?

2758
03:09:48,700 --> 03:09:49,340
What?

2759
03:09:50,380 --> 03:09:51,540
What does it do?

2760
03:09:54,480 --> 03:09:56,400
Wait, just drink milk!

2761
03:09:57,320 --> 03:09:58,860
You're just 1 HP, you're fine!

2762
03:10:00,420 --> 03:10:01,740
Creeper, look out!

2763
03:10:05,620 --> 03:10:07,060
Take my head!

2764
03:10:07,240 --> 03:10:08,120
Just drink some milk!

2765
03:10:14,960 --> 03:10:18,690
My strength is compromised!

2766
03:10:19,730 --> 03:10:23,070
Sorry, I was eating my taco again.

2767
03:10:23,870 --> 03:10:24,570
Are you alright?

2768
03:10:25,570 --> 03:10:28,110
I was eating my taco again.

2769
03:10:28,110 --> 03:10:29,490
Go and find the others.

2770
03:10:29,610 --> 03:10:31,790
Hopefully you can find a way to get down to me or something.

2771
03:10:33,090 --> 03:10:34,930
Time to be a hero again.

2772
03:10:36,470 --> 03:10:37,390
Stay safe!

2773
03:10:37,670 --> 03:10:38,870
I'll find a way down to you!

2774
03:10:41,230 --> 03:10:42,910
No taco time!

2775
03:10:44,010 --> 03:10:46,990
Every time I fall down a hole, I'm eating my taco.

2776
03:10:49,410 --> 03:10:50,770
We got cut in his arm!

2777
03:10:50,870 --> 03:10:52,730
It happened to his arm again!

2778
03:10:54,250 --> 03:10:54,730
Lee!

2779
03:11:02,260 --> 03:11:05,760
How was I supposed to know I was going to fall down again?

2780
03:11:09,570 --> 03:11:10,690
Where did I go?

2781
03:11:11,850 --> 03:11:12,710
I guess here?

2782
03:11:19,080 --> 03:11:19,500
Hello?

2783
03:11:22,420 --> 03:11:23,220
Sorin?

2784
03:11:28,220 --> 03:11:29,020
Sorin?

2785
03:11:30,300 --> 03:11:31,720
Are you here?

2786
03:11:33,440 --> 03:11:35,540
Please, get over here.

2787
03:11:36,740 --> 03:11:38,720
Do you have any milk, Sorin?

2788
03:11:38,740 --> 03:11:39,200
Sorin?

2789
03:11:41,560 --> 03:11:42,980
We need milk!

2790
03:11:46,500 --> 03:11:48,140
All the cows dead?

2791
03:11:49,320 --> 03:11:52,400
My god, this is the longest fucking hallway of my life.

2792
03:12:08,580 --> 03:12:09,220
Hello?

2793
03:12:16,010 --> 03:12:17,930
I like how I can't even run.

2794
03:12:18,530 --> 03:12:19,990
I just have to walk through this.

2795
03:12:20,230 --> 03:12:21,430
Oh, there's a bedroom there!

2796
03:12:22,890 --> 03:12:24,090
Wait, there's a little hole.

2797
03:12:24,790 --> 03:12:25,710
What's in there?

2798
03:12:28,210 --> 03:12:28,750
Hello?

2799
03:12:30,330 --> 03:12:33,430
It didn't matter if I followed Ellingard or Magnus.

2800
03:12:33,550 --> 03:12:34,750
It literally didn't matter.

2801
03:12:35,790 --> 03:12:37,350
I just fall in a hole anyway.

2802
03:12:46,540 --> 03:12:47,260
Oh, wait.

2803
03:12:48,420 --> 03:12:49,180
Show yourself!

2804
03:12:50,460 --> 03:12:51,000
Ivor?

2805
03:12:58,820 --> 03:12:59,280
Ivor?

2806
03:12:59,520 --> 03:13:03,080
I found the Order!

2807
03:13:03,220 --> 03:13:04,400
It's over for you!

2808
03:13:08,260 --> 03:13:10,740
Okay, let me just tell him his entire plan.

2809
03:13:16,200 --> 03:13:18,760
Who the fuck said Ivor is kinda hot?

2810
03:13:18,760 --> 03:13:20,260
Are you like Rasputin core?

2811
03:13:26,040 --> 03:13:28,760
Stop right there, criminal scum!

2812
03:13:29,600 --> 03:13:31,240
Stop right there, Ivor!

2813
03:13:32,740 --> 03:13:33,380
Gabriel!

2814
03:13:33,380 --> 03:13:34,380
You're alive!

2815
03:13:34,700 --> 03:13:36,120
Against all your best efforts, Ivor.

2816
03:13:36,640 --> 03:13:37,860
Look at what you've done.

2817
03:13:38,660 --> 03:13:41,040
I never dreamt that even you could be this twisted.

2818
03:13:41,420 --> 03:13:43,380
Save your posturing, Gabriel.

2819
03:13:44,040 --> 03:13:47,000
We both knew your words have always been hollow.

2820
03:13:47,760 --> 03:13:49,100
I wrote this game.

2821
03:13:49,960 --> 03:13:51,940
You're not going anywhere anymore.

2822
03:13:52,560 --> 03:13:54,080
At least not in one piece.

2823
03:13:54,300 --> 03:13:56,200
The threats pass harmlessly through me.

2824
03:13:56,200 --> 03:13:57,320
Fight!

2825
03:13:57,440 --> 03:13:57,920
Fight!

2826
03:13:58,180 --> 03:13:58,300
Fight!

2827
03:13:59,460 --> 03:14:00,960
Don't say anything!

2828
03:14:01,100 --> 03:14:02,020
I wanna know more!

2829
03:14:05,860 --> 03:14:08,120
Oh my god, I should've said something.

2830
03:14:09,160 --> 03:14:10,440
Don't worry!

2831
03:14:11,120 --> 03:14:12,340
I've got you!

2832
03:14:14,340 --> 03:14:15,640
I did it.

2833
03:14:20,380 --> 03:14:21,720
Fight him!

2834
03:14:22,520 --> 03:14:24,640
Gabriel, fight him!

2835
03:14:25,780 --> 03:14:26,940
Turn him, too!

2836
03:14:35,770 --> 03:14:36,210
Nice.

2837
03:14:38,770 --> 03:14:41,130
The one time I actually do my job.

2838
03:14:42,090 --> 03:14:42,370
Yeah.

2839
03:14:43,950 --> 03:14:45,450
This could have all been avoided.

2840
03:14:46,410 --> 03:14:49,110
If you wanna stop me, you'll have to catch me first.

2841
03:14:49,310 --> 03:14:49,390
Again?

2842
03:14:49,590 --> 03:14:50,490
Just swing it!

2843
03:14:50,550 --> 03:14:51,790
He's using a potion of swiftness.

2844
03:14:51,790 --> 03:14:52,570
Oh, he's fast.

2845
03:14:52,630 --> 03:14:53,310
I thought he was invisible.

2846
03:14:55,810 --> 03:14:56,850
I'm like the wind!

2847
03:14:56,850 --> 03:14:58,890
Oh my god, I wish that worked for me.

2848
03:15:03,510 --> 03:15:04,870
Oh shit, no, Gabriel!

2849
03:15:06,650 --> 03:15:08,210
Oh my god, I should've tanked it.

2850
03:15:08,490 --> 03:15:09,010
Guys, see?

2851
03:15:09,090 --> 03:15:10,010
I told you!

2852
03:15:11,070 --> 03:15:12,830
I should've tanked it!

2853
03:15:13,450 --> 03:15:14,330
Don't worry!

2854
03:15:16,430 --> 03:15:17,970
I've got you, Gabriel!

2855
03:15:23,430 --> 03:15:24,310
It's gonna happen.

2856
03:15:26,850 --> 03:15:27,890
He's getting tired!

2857
03:15:29,090 --> 03:15:30,050
He's on!

2858
03:15:37,890 --> 03:15:38,610
Swing!

2859
03:15:42,640 --> 03:15:43,920
Don't let him leave.

2860
03:15:45,240 --> 03:15:47,060
We'll just guard the door and start swinging.

2861
03:15:49,880 --> 03:15:51,100
Just keep swinging.

2862
03:15:53,000 --> 03:15:53,960
Oh, fuck!

2863
03:15:58,980 --> 03:16:00,620
Just stand down.

2864
03:16:05,600 --> 03:16:07,800
This one's on you, you puffed up fool!

2865
03:16:10,640 --> 03:16:12,100
No, Gabriel!

2866
03:16:14,200 --> 03:16:17,160
We won't let you die now!

2867
03:16:17,740 --> 03:16:19,380
There's no time for this.

2868
03:16:23,860 --> 03:16:25,020
Can't let him die now.

2869
03:16:25,400 --> 03:16:25,840
Jesse, Gabriel!

2870
03:16:26,060 --> 03:16:26,780
Even more of you?

2871
03:16:27,260 --> 03:16:30,100
Will this parade of useless babblers never cease?

2872
03:16:31,000 --> 03:16:32,320
What's going on?

2873
03:16:32,680 --> 03:16:33,460
See, guys?

2874
03:16:33,900 --> 03:16:35,460
I can play the game too.

2875
03:16:39,960 --> 03:16:40,600
What?

2876
03:16:45,340 --> 03:16:45,980
What?

2877
03:16:46,160 --> 03:16:47,240
Oh shit!

2878
03:16:49,980 --> 03:16:53,060
Wait, but he like splashed it in front of himself too!

2879
03:17:03,410 --> 03:17:04,930
But they are mistaken.

2880
03:17:05,670 --> 03:17:07,490
And it will cost them their lives.

2881
03:17:10,030 --> 03:17:10,890
Oh no, we're stuck.

2882
03:17:11,650 --> 03:17:14,290
Wait, that was episode 2?!

2883
03:17:14,880 --> 03:17:16,530
That was such a short episode!

2884
03:17:20,410 --> 03:17:22,610
Oh no, we've been slow-mo'd!

2885
03:17:25,330 --> 03:17:25,810
What?

2886
03:17:30,970 --> 03:17:32,570
That was such a fast one!

2887
03:17:32,650 --> 03:17:33,590
I didn't expect it!

2888
03:17:35,530 --> 03:17:36,270
My last taco.

2889
03:17:40,410 --> 03:17:42,390
I'm tempted to get my ice cream too.

2890
03:17:43,670 --> 03:17:44,890
I might as well, it's like a movie.

2891
03:17:44,890 --> 03:17:48,810
Is there any way to cure Gabriel's wither sickness?

2892
03:17:50,330 --> 03:17:54,050
Would they find a way to defeat the wither storm?

2893
03:17:54,430 --> 03:18:01,550
Or would they remain trapped as it continues its ravenous rampage across the entire world?

2894
03:18:05,590 --> 03:18:07,810
Or would you die in a hotel?

2895
03:18:22,310 --> 03:18:23,910
Alright, so we have two episodes left.

2896
03:18:26,210 --> 03:18:27,790
I don't know if he dies or not.

2897
03:18:27,930 --> 03:18:29,190
I mean, he has the wither sickness.

2898
03:18:30,230 --> 03:18:34,790
So I'm like, how fast does the wither sickness actually work at?

2899
03:18:35,950 --> 03:18:39,010
Oh hey, me and my doom yaoi.

2900
03:18:41,130 --> 03:18:41,650
Oh,

2901
03:18:44,930 --> 03:18:45,430
it's 5?

2902
03:18:45,630 --> 03:18:45,890
Okay.

2903
03:18:57,610 --> 03:18:58,250
Every

2904
03:19:03,460 --> 03:19:04,100
challenge...

2905
03:19:04,100 --> 03:19:04,660
Lucas!

2906
03:19:06,500 --> 03:19:08,380
And every failure...

2907
03:19:10,760 --> 03:19:12,120
There is a gift.

2908
03:19:14,560 --> 03:19:15,660
Wait, what is story arc?

2909
03:19:19,240 --> 03:19:21,440
It's almost like, what's doom yaoi?

2910
03:19:21,600 --> 03:19:23,000
It's yaoi that's doom.

2911
03:19:25,360 --> 03:19:28,140
We find new ones in our heroes.

2912
03:19:29,800 --> 03:19:34,120
When we're given grief, we find a way to give it back.

2913
03:19:34,120 --> 03:19:35,800
What does it mean by this arc is war?

2914
03:19:37,140 --> 03:19:37,960
What does that mean?

2915
03:19:38,000 --> 03:19:40,640
Why does the sound suddenly went so loud?

2916
03:19:41,820 --> 03:19:46,080
They will bring together the bravest and the brightest to stop it.

2917
03:19:48,100 --> 03:19:52,220
But finding the last and most elusive member of the Order of the Stone...

2918
03:19:53,820 --> 03:19:55,300
Yeah, I was like, why did it get louder?

2919
03:19:55,920 --> 03:20:01,020
Would prove their most perilous mission yet.

2920
03:20:05,440 --> 03:20:09,420
For some would rather our hero's story end here.

2921
03:20:15,030 --> 03:20:18,110
Shutting the door on their adventure forever.

2922
03:20:25,480 --> 03:20:31,200
But like all doors, when one closes, another is bound to open.

2923
03:20:33,960 --> 03:20:35,240
What's gonna happen?

2924
03:20:37,340 --> 03:20:38,500
No!

2925
03:20:41,580 --> 03:20:43,140
Stop him!

2926
03:20:44,360 --> 03:20:46,020
He's just walking away slowly!

2927
03:20:46,900 --> 03:20:48,640
Come back and fight!

2928
03:20:49,240 --> 03:20:51,260
Come back and fight!

2929
03:20:52,700 --> 03:20:53,280
Coward!

2930
03:21:07,260 --> 03:21:11,260
That was not... that was a short potion.

2931
03:21:11,260 --> 03:21:11,400
Good.

2932
03:21:14,220 --> 03:21:15,260
Everyone okay?

2933
03:21:20,720 --> 03:21:24,100
So what happened to Elengard and Magnus?

2934
03:21:24,100 --> 03:21:26,820
We need to find Sorin.

2935
03:21:42,830 --> 03:21:43,830
No, look.

2936
03:21:44,070 --> 03:21:45,970
He beat you.

2937
03:21:46,930 --> 03:21:49,680
No, I think the one won!

2938
03:21:50,270 --> 03:21:52,870
That's how I beat him.

2939
03:21:57,710 --> 03:21:58,190
Hahaha.

2940
03:22:01,030 --> 03:22:02,550
It's okay, the bro code.

2941
03:22:03,110 --> 03:22:06,570
He's just- he looks at my- he's looking at my eyes and he understood everything.

2942
03:22:08,630 --> 03:22:10,530
Let's keep this between us, don't worry.

2943
03:22:10,930 --> 03:22:13,970
It'll be a surprise for- it'll be a nice little surprise for everybody.

2944
03:22:17,590 --> 03:22:20,290
Don't be like, surprise!

2945
03:22:21,030 --> 03:22:22,070
He's dying!

2946
03:22:26,950 --> 03:22:28,550
It's like a little gift.

2947
03:22:29,230 --> 03:22:31,490
Everybody, fun little surprise.

2948
03:22:34,130 --> 03:22:35,210
He agreed!

2949
03:22:38,970 --> 03:22:40,630
Happy birthday, surprise!

2950
03:22:42,530 --> 03:22:44,690
Surprise, he's fucking dead.

2951
03:22:47,310 --> 03:22:48,630
Is he yelling for Elengard?

2952
03:22:52,330 --> 03:22:53,670
He doesn't know when he turns.

2953
03:22:58,830 --> 03:23:00,830
Hahaha, we don't need them.

2954
03:23:06,730 --> 03:23:08,410
Oh, burn the books!

2955
03:23:11,770 --> 03:23:12,470
Oh, wait, what?

2956
03:23:13,350 --> 03:23:14,310
We need to burn the books.

2957
03:23:16,710 --> 03:23:18,450
I thought it was a cool idea.

2958
03:23:18,890 --> 03:23:19,480
His bookcase.

2959
03:23:30,850 --> 03:23:32,750
Haha, you wanna get sucked?

2960
03:23:33,230 --> 03:23:34,110
Let's doom this.

2961
03:23:47,190 --> 03:23:48,890
Let's doom it even more.

2962
03:23:57,330 --> 03:23:59,250
Haha, stop flirting!

2963
03:24:01,190 --> 03:24:01,890
Okay.

2964
03:24:03,530 --> 03:24:04,710
Right below us.

2965
03:24:15,990 --> 03:24:18,790
So what?

2966
03:24:22,070 --> 03:24:22,650
What?

2967
03:24:25,170 --> 03:24:27,790
Okay, we have a better plan exactly.

2968
03:24:31,590 --> 03:24:33,030
Yeah, that's right, Lucas!

2969
03:24:37,370 --> 03:24:40,910
You don't have a better plan, so we're brute-forcing this.

2970
03:24:43,540 --> 03:24:44,810
Just dig down.

2971
03:24:45,170 --> 03:24:46,870
Haha, just dig down.

2972
03:24:47,710 --> 03:24:49,930
What's the worst that could happen when we dig down?

2973
03:24:54,450 --> 03:24:55,290
Wait,

2974
03:25:00,420 --> 03:25:02,120
that's not... that's not stone.

2975
03:25:03,720 --> 03:25:04,980
That's brick.

2976
03:25:14,880 --> 03:25:16,560
Jump down.

2977
03:25:21,420 --> 03:25:23,080
Yeah, we couldn't do that to the bookshelf?

2978
03:25:23,220 --> 03:25:23,740
Well, you're right.

2979
03:25:24,220 --> 03:25:25,700
Why can't we just punch the bookshelf?

2980
03:25:33,280 --> 03:25:40,100
It's just bats.

2981
03:25:43,340 --> 03:25:44,220
You hear that?

2982
03:25:48,780 --> 03:25:49,600
Jump down.

2983
03:25:49,600 --> 03:25:54,480
Oh, I should've said dot dot dot, and then let her jump down and experience the bats.

2984
03:25:58,120 --> 03:25:59,000
Get away!

2985
03:25:59,360 --> 03:26:00,680
Get away, bats!

2986
03:26:01,840 --> 03:26:02,160
Leave!

2987
03:26:14,630 --> 03:26:15,410
It's okay.

2988
03:26:16,190 --> 03:26:19,550
I didn't get bit by a bat, so I won't get rabies.

2989
03:26:22,210 --> 03:26:25,070
Anyway, let's see if I can drink water right now.

2990
03:26:30,210 --> 03:26:31,650
It's okay, his tummy hurts.

2991
03:26:32,190 --> 03:26:33,390
Yeah, he just slipped, guys.

2992
03:26:34,370 --> 03:26:34,990
What's that smell?

2993
03:26:50,110 --> 03:26:53,330
That's not the scientific... that's not even the scientific word.

2994
03:26:53,430 --> 03:26:54,850
The scientific word is feces.

2995
03:26:56,850 --> 03:26:57,830
It's okay, guys.

2996
03:26:57,930 --> 03:26:59,770
It's not... the surprise isn't ready yet.

2997
03:27:00,570 --> 03:27:02,070
We're not close to the surprise.

2998
03:27:06,170 --> 03:27:07,430
Okay, we go this way.

2999
03:27:10,570 --> 03:27:12,370
Oh, we're in the mineshaft, are we?

3000
03:27:14,710 --> 03:27:17,210
Oh, he has a secret town?

3001
03:27:30,860 --> 03:27:32,200
No, we have to find Sorin.

3002
03:27:34,460 --> 03:27:34,760
Why?

3003
03:27:36,160 --> 03:27:37,000
Why?

3004
03:27:37,000 --> 03:27:37,840
Yeah, why are you scared?

3005
03:27:39,880 --> 03:27:40,340
Why?

3006
03:27:40,640 --> 03:27:41,640
A grinder?

3007
03:27:44,060 --> 03:27:44,280
Oh!

3008
03:27:48,560 --> 03:27:48,980
Oh!

3009
03:27:55,380 --> 03:27:57,320
Oh my god, he has a mob farmer!

3010
03:27:57,900 --> 03:27:58,580
Yeah!

3011
03:28:01,400 --> 03:28:02,600
Holy shit!

3012
03:28:05,180 --> 03:28:07,660
Oh my god, imagine the XP, guys!

3013
03:28:10,320 --> 03:28:12,040
I could be so strong right now.

3014
03:28:15,310 --> 03:28:16,650
Oh, that's why it's so dark.

3015
03:28:19,710 --> 03:28:20,910
Bro knows the tech.

3016
03:28:21,270 --> 03:28:21,590
Yeah.

3017
03:28:24,770 --> 03:28:26,430
Okay, he definitely can't handle this.

3018
03:28:27,790 --> 03:28:28,310
Explode.

3019
03:28:29,690 --> 03:28:30,470
I'm gonna explode!

3020
03:28:32,990 --> 03:28:34,250
Okay, wait, what do I...

3021
03:28:40,520 --> 03:28:41,900
Oh shit!

3022
03:28:43,240 --> 03:28:44,820
I did it!

3023
03:28:47,380 --> 03:28:49,240
Look, I did it!

3024
03:28:49,400 --> 03:28:51,540
Guys, I did it!

3025
03:28:52,320 --> 03:28:53,920
That's so smart.

3026
03:28:54,620 --> 03:28:57,460
It worked!

3027
03:28:58,540 --> 03:28:59,780
Did it not work?

3028
03:29:00,780 --> 03:29:02,060
All part of the plan.

3029
03:29:04,820 --> 03:29:05,800
Oh no.

3030
03:29:08,080 --> 03:29:10,480
Wait, I don't need it anymore after I find Sorin.

3031
03:29:27,980 --> 03:29:29,160
Jumping is easy.

3032
03:29:31,240 --> 03:29:32,880
Yeah, I've done so many jumps.

3033
03:29:37,390 --> 03:29:38,210
Oh my god, look at Gabriel!

3034
03:29:43,370 --> 03:29:45,850
Wait, we're destroying his mob farmer!

3035
03:29:47,570 --> 03:29:49,390
Oh my god, we're assholes!

3036
03:29:50,790 --> 03:29:52,110
Oh, that's cool.

3037
03:29:52,630 --> 03:29:53,510
Wait, that's cool.

3038
03:29:53,950 --> 03:29:55,730
Oh my god, there's poison spiders too.

3039
03:29:57,010 --> 03:29:58,570
Yeah, stop breaking his mob!

3040
03:29:58,670 --> 03:29:59,290
He spent...

3041
03:29:59,930 --> 03:30:02,550
He spent 10 days on this, guys.

3042
03:30:05,050 --> 03:30:07,230
Oh my god, we're the true griefers.

3043
03:30:07,650 --> 03:30:09,730
We're actually griefing his mob farm.

3044
03:30:11,490 --> 03:30:13,830
Oh right, I'm the king of Boomtown.

3045
03:30:16,850 --> 03:30:21,070
Guys, I've made mob farms before.

3046
03:30:21,330 --> 03:30:23,690
That shit is not fun.

3047
03:30:26,650 --> 03:30:29,310
And he definitely did it in adventure mode.

3048
03:30:30,270 --> 03:30:31,830
He did not do it in creative.

3049
03:30:34,230 --> 03:30:35,970
It is not fun.

3050
03:30:41,710 --> 03:30:42,550
Watch out!

3051
03:30:47,220 --> 03:30:47,920
Oh shit.

3052
03:30:48,460 --> 03:30:49,960
Wait, would I get hit if I did that?

3053
03:30:50,020 --> 03:30:50,640
I'm gonna get hit here.

3054
03:30:50,660 --> 03:30:52,440
Hey bonehead, I'm talking to you!

3055
03:30:54,100 --> 03:30:55,540
Any time now, Jesse!

3056
03:30:57,820 --> 03:30:58,700
Or survival.

3057
03:30:58,860 --> 03:31:00,540
Sorry, he did it in survival mode.

3058
03:31:00,640 --> 03:31:01,020
Wait, what?

3059
03:31:04,240 --> 03:31:06,820
Yeah, sorry, but he did that in survival mode.

3060
03:31:07,100 --> 03:31:08,100
That's not fun.

3061
03:31:08,540 --> 03:31:09,980
Don't just stand there, let's go!

3062
03:31:12,760 --> 03:31:14,580
It's very time consuming.

3063
03:31:16,340 --> 03:31:17,820
I don't know why I thought adventure.

3064
03:31:18,040 --> 03:31:19,420
Adventure just seems more...

3065
03:31:21,220 --> 03:31:22,140
Just seems cooler.

3066
03:31:22,580 --> 03:31:23,320
What if I get poisoned?

3067
03:31:29,920 --> 03:31:33,040
Yeah, I wanted to see what it's like if I just got bit by a poison.

3068
03:31:33,380 --> 03:31:35,440
So I can match with Gabriel.

3069
03:31:38,620 --> 03:31:42,480
I was like, what if I just get bit and just become Spider-Man?

3070
03:31:45,700 --> 03:31:46,940
Hold on!

3071
03:31:49,450 --> 03:31:50,510
No way!

3072
03:31:52,190 --> 03:31:53,270
We got this!

3073
03:31:58,270 --> 03:31:59,630
Reuben, wait up!

3074
03:32:02,650 --> 03:32:08,170
Imagine doing their 3D choreo for the 3D tracking for Minecraft story mode.

3075
03:32:12,040 --> 03:32:14,420
What if Gabriel just dies in the intro?

3076
03:32:16,660 --> 03:32:19,400
I knew Gabriel's got this, guys!

3077
03:32:20,600 --> 03:32:22,500
That's why I didn't come save him.

3078
03:32:22,720 --> 03:32:25,180
I wanted to see Gabriel swing his sword.

3079
03:32:32,660 --> 03:32:33,980
Oh shit, no, Reuben!

3080
03:32:43,900 --> 03:32:45,100
So cool.

3081
03:32:45,880 --> 03:32:46,580
Oops, sorry.

3082
03:32:48,320 --> 03:32:49,440
Dooming it even more.

3083
03:33:02,400 --> 03:33:03,680
Oh no, no!

3084
03:33:04,570 --> 03:33:08,180
We can't mob farm the amulet, it doesn't give levels!

3085
03:33:08,800 --> 03:33:09,620
Save amulet.

3086
03:33:14,470 --> 03:33:15,980
You don't understand!

3087
03:33:18,470 --> 03:33:20,360
This is much more important!

3088
03:33:25,600 --> 03:33:27,320
No hesitation.

3089
03:33:27,320 --> 03:33:27,920
Hesitation.

3090
03:33:33,730 --> 03:33:36,690
I'm here to save the world, not save friends.

3091
03:33:38,470 --> 03:33:40,270
Joking, friends are the world.

3092
03:33:45,350 --> 03:33:46,430
Oh see, they're 5.

3093
03:33:50,390 --> 03:33:51,590
Don't worry, I got you!

3094
03:33:58,710 --> 03:33:59,970
Oh shit, wait.

3095
03:34:00,890 --> 03:34:02,130
Who's gonna save me?

3096
03:34:03,790 --> 03:34:04,850
What happened?

3097
03:34:07,030 --> 03:34:08,190
Do I get grinded?

3098
03:34:14,840 --> 03:34:17,120
Oh shit, I was curious!

3099
03:34:17,520 --> 03:34:20,740
I was curious if like, I just get grinded or not.

3100
03:34:21,120 --> 03:34:23,520
Don't worry, I'll make the right choice this time.

3101
03:34:25,300 --> 03:34:26,640
Don't worry, guys.

3102
03:34:28,940 --> 03:34:30,360
I'll make the right choice.

3103
03:34:34,510 --> 03:34:37,210
I thought it was the intro, I didn't miss!

3104
03:34:37,430 --> 03:34:39,410
Save the amulet, cause that was always the right choice.

3105
03:34:39,410 --> 03:34:41,950
Cause my first choice was the right choice.

3106
03:34:49,050 --> 03:34:49,930
It's okay.

3107
03:34:50,250 --> 03:34:54,290
How was I supposed to know you can die in the intro?

3108
03:34:58,650 --> 03:34:59,750
Okay, nice.

3109
03:35:06,110 --> 03:35:07,570
Don't worry, guys!

3110
03:35:09,350 --> 03:35:10,810
I can save you again!

3111
03:35:13,270 --> 03:35:14,290
These spiders are so tiny.

3112
03:35:16,190 --> 03:35:19,230
Where are all these mob spawners coming from?

3113
03:35:25,640 --> 03:35:34,360
Okay, now that I know that you can die, die in the intro, let me get a rocket jump real quick.

3114
03:35:36,200 --> 03:35:38,020
Oh my god!

3115
03:35:38,480 --> 03:35:40,720
And there was slime technology?

3116
03:35:41,240 --> 03:35:43,360
Oh my god.

3117
03:35:45,160 --> 03:35:46,560
That's too far.

3118
03:35:46,560 --> 03:35:49,760
That's too far, guys.

3119
03:35:50,390 --> 03:35:52,140
This is where I draw the line.

3120
03:35:59,810 --> 03:36:01,200
Oh my god.

3121
03:36:01,880 --> 03:36:03,960
No, the trappers!

3122
03:36:33,690 --> 03:36:35,730
Oh my god, this shit is crazy.

3123
03:36:37,470 --> 03:36:39,450
This is a lag machine right there.

3124
03:36:40,310 --> 03:36:41,810
This is like...

3125
03:36:42,280 --> 03:36:45,650
God, this is a bannable offense in my Minecraft server.

3126
03:36:51,970 --> 03:36:53,370
Everyone's gotta be close.

3127
03:36:59,450 --> 03:36:59,830
What?

3128
03:37:14,180 --> 03:37:16,300
Are we getting crazier with wither sickness?

3129
03:37:33,510 --> 03:37:34,900
I'll keep that in mind.

3130
03:37:35,040 --> 03:37:35,700
You're so right.

3131
03:37:36,720 --> 03:37:37,500
I'm not!

3132
03:37:37,780 --> 03:37:38,360
I'm not!

3133
03:37:38,360 --> 03:37:40,520
I'll keep that in mind.

3134
03:37:42,300 --> 03:37:43,140
Don't worry.

3135
03:37:43,520 --> 03:37:47,740
Guys, I'm just appeasing the old man before he dies.

3136
03:37:48,140 --> 03:37:48,600
Guys.

3137
03:37:52,780 --> 03:37:55,860
I need to make sure he thinks that I'm with him before he dies.

3138
03:37:56,020 --> 03:37:58,660
So then he, you know, he dies happy.

3139
03:38:09,360 --> 03:38:14,540
You're not gonna tell your grandpa that he's been wrong this entire time just as about he's dying.

3140
03:38:15,540 --> 03:38:17,480
Don't touch my pig!

3141
03:38:22,620 --> 03:38:23,300
Yeah,

3142
03:38:26,460 --> 03:38:27,320
he's a pig.

3143
03:38:38,360 --> 03:38:40,320
You have got to be kidding me.

3144
03:38:43,160 --> 03:38:46,000
Okay, Ruben will understand.

3145
03:38:47,360 --> 03:38:47,960
He'll understand.

3146
03:38:48,140 --> 03:38:49,160
I'll give him treats later.

3147
03:38:51,220 --> 03:38:51,880
What the fuck?

3148
03:38:53,180 --> 03:38:55,580
Oh, yeah, because the mom timer doesn't work anymore.

3149
03:38:56,720 --> 03:39:00,060
The mom timer is really out and he stays tuned.

3150
03:39:11,230 --> 03:39:13,370
He's pouring mom fire.

3151
03:39:17,550 --> 03:39:18,610
Oh, shit.

3152
03:39:25,030 --> 03:39:26,110
Don't worry.

3153
03:39:27,430 --> 03:39:28,790
I got you.

3154
03:39:28,930 --> 03:39:29,770
Oh, shit.

3155
03:39:29,830 --> 03:39:30,710
I don't got you.

3156
03:39:30,850 --> 03:39:31,570
I pressed W.

3157
03:39:32,070 --> 03:39:33,130
Am I dead?

3158
03:39:33,270 --> 03:39:33,830
Oh, shit.

3159
03:39:33,910 --> 03:39:34,130
Okay.

3160
03:39:35,010 --> 03:39:35,350
Whoops.

3161
03:39:35,890 --> 03:39:36,770
I accidentally pressed W.

3162
03:39:41,430 --> 03:39:41,950
Sorry.

3163
03:39:44,710 --> 03:39:46,030
Okay, I got this.

3164
03:39:47,730 --> 03:39:48,770
My mis-input.

3165
03:39:48,910 --> 03:39:50,750
The W was next to the E, guys.

3166
03:39:51,770 --> 03:39:52,570
Oh, my ice cream.

3167
03:39:58,250 --> 03:39:59,630
Okay, we got this!

3168
03:40:02,250 --> 03:40:05,950
At this point, Duke has already become a masochist.

3169
03:40:06,290 --> 03:40:07,910
Thank you for the super chat, Fenrir.

3170
03:40:07,990 --> 03:40:09,070
Thank you, thank you.

3171
03:40:09,830 --> 03:40:10,770
Okay, I got this.

3172
03:40:11,430 --> 03:40:13,170
Okay, I won't die this time.

3173
03:40:14,270 --> 03:40:19,310
How do I have like one spider fight and then it was over for me?

3174
03:40:21,310 --> 03:40:22,990
How is that possible?

3175
03:40:26,890 --> 03:40:29,150
Did I only have one heart?

3176
03:40:32,830 --> 03:40:33,570
Got you.

3177
03:40:35,830 --> 03:40:37,230
Get out of here!

3178
03:40:41,110 --> 03:40:42,850
There's two things I hate.

3179
03:40:43,050 --> 03:40:44,490
It's running and monsters.

3180
03:40:44,670 --> 03:40:45,110
Yeah!

3181
03:40:47,810 --> 03:40:48,870
Wait, what?

3182
03:40:51,290 --> 03:40:51,970
What?

3183
03:40:54,070 --> 03:40:54,750
Sorry?

3184
03:40:55,410 --> 03:40:56,110
Oh, Gabriel!

3185
03:40:59,830 --> 03:41:00,770
It's okay!

3186
03:41:02,430 --> 03:41:03,450
I got you!

3187
03:41:03,770 --> 03:41:05,650
You're not dying yet!

3188
03:41:09,070 --> 03:41:11,950
I need you to die in front of our friends!

3189
03:41:14,050 --> 03:41:15,950
Remember about the surprise!

3190
03:41:20,070 --> 03:41:23,510
I need you to be there for the surprise!

3191
03:41:38,420 --> 03:41:41,320
I like the whoop sound effect.

3192
03:41:42,500 --> 03:41:44,900
You gotta turn in front of them, dude!

3193
03:41:45,140 --> 03:41:46,660
Remember the deal!

3194
03:41:48,220 --> 03:41:50,580
You said we gotta keep it a surprise!

3195
03:41:55,000 --> 03:41:57,280
Jesus, he does not look okay.

3196
03:41:58,360 --> 03:42:00,560
How did they not know?

3197
03:42:07,440 --> 03:42:08,940
Are you hurt?

3198
03:42:10,180 --> 03:42:12,100
Don't worry, I'm giving him the hot and cold.

3199
03:42:13,760 --> 03:42:15,540
I said, are you hurt?

3200
03:42:21,740 --> 03:42:22,560
Don't look at him!

3201
03:42:22,680 --> 03:42:23,240
Don't look at him!

3202
03:42:23,320 --> 03:42:24,100
Don't look at him!

3203
03:42:30,940 --> 03:42:31,960
Don't look, guys.

3204
03:42:32,460 --> 03:42:32,960
Don't look.

3205
03:42:34,700 --> 03:42:35,800
Just don't look at them.

3206
03:42:40,360 --> 03:42:41,660
Yeah, wait, he did!

3207
03:42:41,900 --> 03:42:43,160
He said look!

3208
03:42:51,020 --> 03:42:52,040
He has batteries?

3209
03:42:53,420 --> 03:42:54,200
Oh, okay.

3210
03:42:56,340 --> 03:42:58,280
I was like, did it run out of batteries?

3211
03:43:04,380 --> 03:43:05,660
At least we're alive.

3212
03:43:06,880 --> 03:43:08,860
Lucas, stop fucking whining!

3213
03:43:11,520 --> 03:43:12,660
I'm a bit of a bitch.

3214
03:43:17,080 --> 03:43:19,020
At least most of us are alive.

3215
03:43:23,460 --> 03:43:23,900
What?

3216
03:43:24,480 --> 03:43:25,280
Oh, there he is!

3217
03:43:29,660 --> 03:43:30,400
Where's he going?

3218
03:43:32,500 --> 03:43:32,940
Yeah.

3219
03:43:35,460 --> 03:43:38,400
The legendary amulet runs on two AAA batteries.

3220
03:43:39,200 --> 03:43:40,880
It's gonna be like, what the fuck?

3221
03:43:40,940 --> 03:43:42,200
Do we need to find batteries now?

3222
03:43:42,200 --> 03:43:42,360
What?

3223
03:43:48,020 --> 03:43:52,020
Great, we'll follow you.

3224
03:43:53,540 --> 03:43:54,700
Yeah, go, Gabriel!

3225
03:43:59,640 --> 03:44:01,660
I believe in you, Gabriel.

3226
03:44:04,880 --> 03:44:06,800
Okay, I'll follow you, Lucas.

3227
03:44:07,900 --> 03:44:12,020
Just put him in the front line!

3228
03:44:24,220 --> 03:44:25,400
Just don't look.

3229
03:44:25,960 --> 03:44:26,780
Just don't look.

3230
03:44:35,840 --> 03:44:36,880
Of course!

3231
03:44:37,320 --> 03:44:38,060
Hot and cold.

3232
03:44:38,340 --> 03:44:41,000
That's how all the doomed ship goes.

3233
03:44:42,760 --> 03:44:44,520
Wait, this goes back to the overworld.

3234
03:44:55,610 --> 03:44:56,590
Okay, up I go.

3235
03:44:59,050 --> 03:45:00,830
Thanks for being the meat shield, Lucas.

3236
03:45:06,270 --> 03:45:08,210
I don't understand why that's gameplay.

3237
03:45:08,330 --> 03:45:08,910
I don't understand why that's gameplay.

3238
03:45:10,370 --> 03:45:16,650
Like, just go... You walk in one direction and... Like, I could've just had that as a cutscene.

3239
03:45:16,990 --> 03:45:18,630
I did not have to walk there.

3240
03:45:19,010 --> 03:45:20,610
There was nowhere else to go.

3241
03:45:25,120 --> 03:45:26,200
You okay?

3242
03:45:28,360 --> 03:45:29,340
You need a hand?

3243
03:45:40,280 --> 03:45:42,560
Oh my god, is he gonna fall off the cliff?

3244
03:45:43,940 --> 03:45:44,560
Surprise!

3245
03:45:53,870 --> 03:45:55,510
Does anyone have any food?

3246
03:45:56,870 --> 03:45:59,210
A ladder is just a vertical stair.

3247
03:46:05,980 --> 03:46:09,640
Wait, me?

3248
03:46:16,080 --> 03:46:18,100
I mean, it's not that long.

3249
03:46:22,960 --> 03:46:25,480
Alright, opening the trapdoor.

3250
03:46:26,760 --> 03:46:27,200
Hello?

3251
03:46:29,060 --> 03:46:31,320
What the fuck is this?

3252
03:46:32,980 --> 03:46:35,180
Well, Jim Carrey...

3253
03:46:36,140 --> 03:46:38,400
He created his...

3254
03:46:39,800 --> 03:46:41,220
It's beautiful!

3255
03:46:45,060 --> 03:46:46,020
It's beautiful!

3256
03:46:47,360 --> 03:46:48,460
The Truman Show.

3257
03:46:48,600 --> 03:46:51,880
Yeah, what the fuck is this Jim Carrey Truman Show that I'm watching?

3258
03:46:52,540 --> 03:46:58,720
You know like those Minecraft shorts where they recreate the Truman Show on the Minecraft shorts on YouTube?

3259
03:46:59,160 --> 03:47:01,400
That's exactly what they do.

3260
03:47:03,200 --> 03:47:04,480
It's like...

3261
03:47:12,520 --> 03:47:16,660
You know, it's like that line where if I don't see it then...

3262
03:47:16,660 --> 03:47:17,700
I look at it.

3263
03:47:37,240 --> 03:47:39,500
He's building his own Truman Show!

3264
03:47:43,040 --> 03:47:43,660
Probably...

3265
03:47:43,660 --> 03:47:45,220
Hey, maybe he's...

3266
03:47:46,420 --> 03:47:48,000
It's so pretty cool!

3267
03:47:53,010 --> 03:47:54,360
It's a padded room.

3268
03:48:00,640 --> 03:48:02,440
Why are you being like this?

3269
03:48:02,600 --> 03:48:03,620
Are you okay?

3270
03:48:05,680 --> 03:48:07,760
Bro, you wanna talk about it, bro?

3271
03:48:12,200 --> 03:48:12,630
What?

3272
03:48:15,780 --> 03:48:18,080
Oh, Sorensen's Oshie!

3273
03:48:18,180 --> 03:48:19,420
Never meet your heroes!

3274
03:48:20,600 --> 03:48:22,400
Never meet your heroes.

3275
03:48:24,560 --> 03:48:26,120
Flint and steel.

3276
03:48:26,200 --> 03:48:27,360
Let's just burn it down.

3277
03:48:31,460 --> 03:48:34,320
He just needs space.

3278
03:48:36,500 --> 03:48:38,820
That's the winter sickness dying.

3279
03:48:38,820 --> 03:48:41,000
He's allergic to wool.

3280
03:48:50,450 --> 03:48:52,310
We'll group together and find a way out.

3281
03:48:54,730 --> 03:48:55,690
Are you okay?

3282
03:48:57,110 --> 03:48:58,130
How are you feeling?

3283
03:48:59,050 --> 03:49:00,670
Wait, why would he build this?

3284
03:49:00,690 --> 03:49:00,910
Yeah.

3285
03:49:08,610 --> 03:49:09,190
So...

3286
03:49:16,350 --> 03:49:16,990
What?

3287
03:49:18,510 --> 03:49:20,150
How are you feeling, by the way?

3288
03:49:20,850 --> 03:49:23,230
You definitely look so healthy.

3289
03:49:23,930 --> 03:49:24,650
God, no!

3290
03:49:31,430 --> 03:49:34,390
Yeah, other than that.

3291
03:49:36,930 --> 03:49:38,370
So where did Soren go?

3292
03:49:46,250 --> 03:49:48,830
I guess I'm gonna keep looking around.

3293
03:49:49,130 --> 03:49:52,770
I don't think he's, like, okay mentally right now.

3294
03:49:54,170 --> 03:49:57,950
He's definitely... His brain's definitely incredibly... Why is he mad?

3295
03:49:58,410 --> 03:50:00,350
What did I do, Ruben?

3296
03:50:00,630 --> 03:50:04,610
I did not save you and, like, call you just a pig.

3297
03:50:04,810 --> 03:50:06,670
What did I do to you?

3298
03:50:11,090 --> 03:50:11,690
Okay.

3299
03:50:11,690 --> 03:50:11,870
Okay.

3300
03:50:15,970 --> 03:50:17,050
Where is...

3301
03:50:17,050 --> 03:50:20,490
Okay, let's... Actually, before... Let me talk to the others first.

3302
03:50:23,980 --> 03:50:24,480
Hello.

3303
03:50:24,640 --> 03:50:25,140
Hey, guys.

3304
03:50:25,240 --> 03:50:25,660
You guys okay?

3305
03:50:29,800 --> 03:50:33,620
This is literally, like, the Truman shorts for Minecraft.

3306
03:50:34,720 --> 03:50:35,620
Spotter and Lucas.

3307
03:50:36,380 --> 03:50:36,380
Yeah.

3308
03:50:39,420 --> 03:50:39,880
Yeah.

3309
03:50:40,440 --> 03:50:43,960
By the way, Dad's at the babysitter today and tomorrow.

3310
03:50:45,480 --> 03:50:46,980
He was so happy.

3311
03:50:47,320 --> 03:50:49,120
Like, he saw me put, like...

3312
03:50:49,120 --> 03:50:50,360
Because I have a special bag.

3313
03:50:50,860 --> 03:50:58,160
Like, I would put... Whenever I put his dog food in the special bag, he freaks out because he knows it's dog sitter time.

3314
03:50:59,200 --> 03:51:04,700
Like, he, like, knows it's dog sitter time when I put his dog food... Like, his dog food bin in the bag.

3315
03:51:04,700 --> 03:51:06,920
And he was, like, whining in the elevator.

3316
03:51:07,360 --> 03:51:12,740
He was actually, like, whimpering in the elevator because he was so excited to see the dog sitter.

3317
03:51:19,460 --> 03:51:20,860
Did you find anything?

3318
03:51:26,060 --> 03:51:27,740
Did you press it?

3319
03:51:29,960 --> 03:51:31,080
How do you know?

3320
03:51:31,220 --> 03:51:32,220
Did you press the button?

3321
03:51:36,260 --> 03:51:36,720
That's okay.

3322
03:51:36,760 --> 03:51:37,920
I've accepted the fact.

3323
03:51:38,100 --> 03:51:39,100
I accepted it.

3324
03:51:40,400 --> 03:51:41,860
It'll always be you.

3325
03:51:41,940 --> 03:51:44,420
Oh my gosh, they made a wolf zombie.

3326
03:51:48,340 --> 03:51:49,760
Lucas, are you okay?

3327
03:51:51,580 --> 03:51:53,720
Gabriel's worried about you.

3328
03:51:53,720 --> 03:51:54,920
Gabriel's worried about you.

3329
03:51:57,400 --> 03:51:59,740
Listen, I know I've been prickly, okay?

3330
03:52:01,400 --> 03:52:01,920
But...

3331
03:52:01,920 --> 03:52:05,440
Dad loves a dog sitter until he takes it out on Ruben.

3332
03:52:05,800 --> 03:52:07,420
Thank you for the super chat, Deadpool.

3333
03:52:07,580 --> 03:52:08,580
Thank you, thank you.

3334
03:52:09,940 --> 03:52:11,100
I mean, you have to have noticed.

3335
03:52:12,480 --> 03:52:16,170
The lack of energy, the labored breathing...

3336
03:52:16,170 --> 03:52:16,850
What are you saying?

3337
03:52:17,350 --> 03:52:18,690
What could it be?

3338
03:52:19,010 --> 03:52:20,350
What exactly are you saying, Lucas?

3339
03:52:20,350 --> 03:52:20,850
Yeah, Lucas.

3340
03:52:20,970 --> 03:52:21,510
What could it be?

3341
03:52:21,530 --> 03:52:22,550
There's something wrong.

3342
03:52:23,250 --> 03:52:23,530
Okay?

3343
03:52:23,690 --> 03:52:24,230
Something big.

3344
03:52:25,610 --> 03:52:26,990
It's not fooling anybody.

3345
03:52:29,210 --> 03:52:30,290
At least not me.

3346
03:52:30,290 --> 03:52:30,810
No way.

3347
03:52:34,680 --> 03:52:36,300
That's none of your business.

3348
03:52:36,500 --> 03:52:38,780
You're just a ma- What if I don't say anything?

3349
03:52:39,260 --> 03:52:40,240
I don't know.

3350
03:52:41,380 --> 03:52:45,040
Okay, so I tell you what's bothering me and now you have nothing to say about it?

3351
03:52:45,060 --> 03:52:45,780
Oh, I'm doing it!

3352
03:52:51,740 --> 03:52:53,720
I didn't mean that!

3353
03:52:54,340 --> 03:52:55,460
What do you want?

3354
03:52:57,520 --> 03:52:59,000
I keep it together.

3355
03:52:59,000 --> 03:53:02,840
Lucas, no matter how upset you get, you've got to keep it together.

3356
03:53:03,080 --> 03:53:05,360
No, it's gonna forever be doomed!

3357
03:53:10,020 --> 03:53:11,380
What's your problem, Lucas?

3358
03:53:15,110 --> 03:53:15,950
You know what?

3359
03:53:16,350 --> 03:53:17,170
Never mind.

3360
03:53:17,490 --> 03:53:17,830
No!

3361
03:53:20,510 --> 03:53:22,230
It was cold when I should have went hot!

3362
03:53:22,290 --> 03:53:24,190
No, that's not made of metal.

3363
03:53:25,010 --> 03:53:28,070
There must be all sorts of hidden water systems in this place.

3364
03:53:29,830 --> 03:53:33,270
Now there's consequence- Oh no, now Reuben angry.

3365
03:53:34,250 --> 03:53:35,930
Reuben, no, I'm sorry!

3366
03:53:36,030 --> 03:53:37,610
I didn't mean to doom it!

3367
03:53:39,490 --> 03:53:40,770
I'm sorry!

3368
03:53:42,050 --> 03:53:42,690
I didn't know!

3369
03:53:42,810 --> 03:53:49,210
I thought if I say nothing and not acknowledge that I know that things will be okay.

3370
03:53:52,770 --> 03:53:54,910
It's cute, I guess.

3371
03:53:56,250 --> 03:53:57,850
Oh no, Reuben!

3372
03:53:58,250 --> 03:53:59,910
Reuben, no, I'm sorry!

3373
03:54:00,030 --> 03:54:01,170
I did not mean to doom it!

3374
03:54:02,690 --> 03:54:03,550
That's cute.

3375
03:54:09,380 --> 03:54:11,360
Oh no, Reuben, talk to me, Reuben!

3376
03:54:14,920 --> 03:54:17,900
Okay, Reuben knows I fucked up.

3377
03:54:18,820 --> 03:54:21,240
I gotta live with my actions, guys.

3378
03:54:22,560 --> 03:54:24,800
I wanted to keep the surprise!

3379
03:54:26,360 --> 03:54:29,200
I keep my promises, Gabriel!

3380
03:54:29,660 --> 03:54:34,980
I thought if I say nothing, then like, you know...

3381
03:54:34,980 --> 03:54:37,760
Then like I don't acknowledge that I'm lying.

3382
03:54:39,360 --> 03:54:41,180
Reuben knows my sins.

3383
03:54:47,680 --> 03:54:48,960
No, it's okay.

3384
03:54:49,280 --> 03:54:50,420
We'll just be doomed.

3385
03:54:51,740 --> 03:54:53,080
I can fix it.

3386
03:54:57,700 --> 03:54:58,740
Guys, it's okay.

3387
03:54:58,860 --> 03:54:59,640
We can fix it.

3388
03:54:59,820 --> 03:55:02,320
There's still a way to fix the relationship, guys.

3389
03:55:03,560 --> 03:55:05,020
We can still fix it.

3390
03:55:08,620 --> 03:55:10,060
Guys, we can fix it!

3391
03:55:13,160 --> 03:55:15,540
You might be wondering how I got into this scenario.

3392
03:55:20,600 --> 03:55:22,620
We can fix it, guys!

3393
03:55:24,040 --> 03:55:26,460
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

3394
03:55:26,940 --> 03:55:29,840
I just gotta go all- I just gotta go all out.

3395
03:55:33,540 --> 03:55:34,560
It'll be fine.

3396
03:55:35,580 --> 03:55:39,320
Just gotta give Lucas lots of attention.

3397
03:55:42,540 --> 03:55:43,420
It's fixable.

3398
03:55:43,820 --> 03:55:45,040
Guys, I can fix it!

3399
03:55:45,060 --> 03:55:46,380
I can fix this relationship!

3400
03:55:47,580 --> 03:55:48,800
It's okay, Lucas!

3401
03:55:50,460 --> 03:55:52,060
Lucas, I need you to move.

3402
03:55:53,340 --> 03:55:55,920
Lucas, I can't- Lucas, move!

3403
03:56:00,860 --> 03:56:01,900
Alright,

3404
03:56:06,900 --> 03:56:07,700
there we go.

3405
03:56:07,700 --> 03:56:08,680
That wasn't too hard, was it?

3406
03:56:15,260 --> 03:56:16,020
It's okay.

3407
03:56:16,200 --> 03:56:18,840
It's like enemies to lovers, guys.

3408
03:56:18,940 --> 03:56:19,760
It's the...

3409
03:56:20,320 --> 03:56:21,260
It's the trope.

3410
03:56:21,300 --> 03:56:23,060
It's the classic trope, guys.

3411
03:56:23,800 --> 03:56:26,500
Ooh, look at that tension between me and him now.

3412
03:56:26,580 --> 03:56:27,200
Look at that.

3413
03:56:29,780 --> 03:56:32,680
Look at all that tension we have!

3414
03:56:33,060 --> 03:56:34,160
And I'll fix it.

3415
03:56:36,100 --> 03:56:38,700
This will make us stronger in the end.

3416
03:56:43,820 --> 03:56:45,620
Look at the vision!

3417
03:56:47,360 --> 03:56:48,660
Look at the vision!

3418
03:56:49,500 --> 03:56:50,460
See the vision!

3419
03:56:50,680 --> 03:56:51,760
I see the vision.

3420
03:57:01,520 --> 03:57:03,480
It's okay, we're almost at the surprise.

3421
03:57:06,620 --> 03:57:07,820
It's okay.

3422
03:57:08,940 --> 03:57:10,620
I'm just happy you're here, buddy.

3423
03:57:10,800 --> 03:57:11,820
Wait, don't apologize.

3424
03:57:12,880 --> 03:57:14,200
You're just old.

3425
03:57:27,570 --> 03:57:29,230
And dying, true.

3426
03:57:29,490 --> 03:57:29,750
Yeah.

3427
03:57:30,650 --> 03:57:33,050
This is enemies to friends to enemies again.

3428
03:57:33,130 --> 03:57:34,910
You forgot the loving part!

3429
03:57:35,850 --> 03:57:37,590
Nexy, thank you for the super chat.

3430
03:57:37,790 --> 03:57:38,230
Thank you.

3431
03:57:38,670 --> 03:57:40,230
I can fix it!

3432
03:57:40,670 --> 03:57:42,750
I just need to talk to him!

3433
03:57:45,250 --> 03:57:46,050
It's okay.

3434
03:57:46,190 --> 03:57:46,750
It's fixable.

3435
03:57:46,850 --> 03:57:47,790
It's fixable, guys.

3436
03:57:47,970 --> 03:57:48,830
It's so fixable.

3437
03:57:49,030 --> 03:57:50,190
Oh my god, what a builder.

3438
03:57:57,540 --> 03:58:00,060
Is he lonely?

3439
03:58:03,060 --> 03:58:06,720
I think that guy... I think Sorin is just really lonely.

3440
03:58:10,430 --> 03:58:12,410
Oh, the music's coming from here.

3441
03:58:19,220 --> 03:58:21,180
Is Olivia not going to talk to me?

3442
03:58:30,150 --> 03:58:30,750
Hello?

3443
03:58:42,310 --> 03:58:43,290
What the fuck?

3444
03:58:50,230 --> 03:58:51,130
That's him!

3445
03:58:52,170 --> 03:58:52,650
Sorin!

3446
03:58:53,630 --> 03:58:55,190
No, that's just a recording.

3447
03:58:55,670 --> 03:58:56,810
What the...

3448
03:58:58,070 --> 03:58:58,550
Yeah.

3449
03:59:11,250 --> 03:59:14,130
Yeah, it didn't play itself.

3450
03:59:14,470 --> 03:59:15,490
Something played it.

3451
03:59:21,470 --> 03:59:23,890
I guess he really likes the sound of his own voice, then.

3452
03:59:26,150 --> 03:59:26,230
What?

3453
03:59:42,170 --> 03:59:44,210
Oh, he's dressed up as an Enderman!

3454
03:59:46,050 --> 03:59:50,010
He's observing the Enderman like those, like, nature documentaries.

3455
03:59:50,490 --> 03:59:52,210
Where they dress up like penguins.

3456
03:59:57,050 --> 03:59:59,010
They just find a shorter guy.

3457
04:00:05,470 --> 04:00:06,570
Why would he want to?

3458
04:00:06,810 --> 04:00:07,090
Yeah.

3459
04:00:09,010 --> 04:00:10,490
He's an imposter among them.

3460
04:00:16,330 --> 04:00:17,750
Wait, what?

3461
04:00:20,630 --> 04:00:23,250
Okay, now he's definitely crazy.

3462
04:00:24,690 --> 04:00:25,770
Where are these?

3463
04:00:27,890 --> 04:00:29,490
Did I just steal it?

3464
04:00:32,970 --> 04:00:34,250
What the fuck?

3465
04:00:39,970 --> 04:00:42,210
Okay, he's definitely crazy.

3466
04:00:42,630 --> 04:00:43,490
Okay.

3467
04:00:47,410 --> 04:00:49,410
What the fuck?

3468
04:00:54,490 --> 04:00:56,930
That's a love... Oh, he fucked an Enderman!

3469
04:01:02,710 --> 04:01:03,350
Yeah,

3470
04:01:06,790 --> 04:01:09,470
he's got... No, he's definitely banged an Enderman.

3471
04:01:09,950 --> 04:01:12,330
He literally said, that's a love song!

3472
04:01:16,060 --> 04:01:17,220
Okay, put it on.

3473
04:01:17,840 --> 04:01:19,600
I shall become one of them.

3474
04:01:24,070 --> 04:01:25,070
That's right.

3475
04:01:27,450 --> 04:01:29,510
Oh, and it's in all black.

3476
04:01:30,170 --> 04:01:30,570
Kinky!

3477
04:01:33,370 --> 04:01:36,370
Just like American Horror Story all over again.

3478
04:01:45,890 --> 04:01:48,770
Oh, wait, why Stinky?

3479
04:01:49,550 --> 04:01:50,190
Wait...

3480
04:01:50,190 --> 04:01:52,530
Wait...

3481
04:01:52,530 --> 04:01:54,670
Wait...

3482
04:01:54,670 --> 04:01:56,930
Wait a minute...

3483
04:01:56,930 --> 04:01:58,790
What is Soren doing?

3484
04:02:07,970 --> 04:02:09,170
Wait, what's it for?

3485
04:02:12,050 --> 04:02:14,650
Oh, he's teaching the Enderman how to craft!

3486
04:02:41,070 --> 04:02:43,370
Wait, but what happens if I look at the Enderman?

3487
04:02:50,770 --> 04:02:51,810
Yeah, why does he have two?

3488
04:02:52,730 --> 04:02:54,610
And why is one taller than the other?

3489
04:02:57,910 --> 04:03:00,030
Next scene, thank you for the super chat.

3490
04:03:00,190 --> 04:03:02,470
Thank you, thank you.

3491
04:03:02,550 --> 04:03:04,050
The Enderman...

3492
04:03:04,050 --> 04:03:05,810
Percy, what will she do?

3493
04:03:05,850 --> 04:03:07,950
I don't even own this!

3494
04:03:07,950 --> 04:03:10,430
It's not even mine!

3495
04:03:12,410 --> 04:03:14,930
I'm just trying to do my job!

3496
04:03:21,860 --> 04:03:22,780
Ruben, smell.

3497
04:03:22,880 --> 04:03:24,340
What do you smell with your nose?

3498
04:03:26,140 --> 04:03:27,700
I guess he can't smell over here.

3499
04:03:27,800 --> 04:03:28,800
Wait, what's up top though?

3500
04:03:32,570 --> 04:03:33,250
Time up.

3501
04:03:33,510 --> 04:03:34,730
Is there anything important up here?

3502
04:03:37,570 --> 04:03:38,790
No, just books.

3503
04:03:41,930 --> 04:03:42,270
What's up here?

3504
04:03:42,510 --> 04:03:43,850
There has to be something important, right?

3505
04:03:48,030 --> 04:03:50,010
Oh, there's like crafting there.

3506
04:03:52,590 --> 04:03:53,590
But like, does it work?

3507
04:03:53,750 --> 04:03:56,590
Like the... if I look at them through this?

3508
04:03:58,370 --> 04:04:00,390
Oh, I have to pick up clay blocks!

3509
04:04:00,490 --> 04:04:01,910
Okay, I need four.

3510
04:04:02,190 --> 04:04:02,990
Okay, now I know.

3511
04:04:03,810 --> 04:04:05,350
I just have to grab clay blocks.

3512
04:04:06,550 --> 04:04:08,610
Okay, there's like one more downstairs.

3513
04:04:10,190 --> 04:04:11,750
Wait, he was there?

3514
04:04:14,510 --> 04:04:15,470
Wait, he was?

3515
04:04:16,510 --> 04:04:17,950
Oh my god, I didn't see.

3516
04:04:18,690 --> 04:04:19,610
I was looking at...

3517
04:04:21,030 --> 04:04:24,390
Wait, I thought they all looked the same.

3518
04:04:25,570 --> 04:04:26,350
Where is he?

3519
04:04:27,310 --> 04:04:28,530
Oh, I see him!

3520
04:04:28,550 --> 04:04:29,250
I see him!

3521
04:04:29,610 --> 04:04:31,850
He's just standing there, fucking freak!

3522
04:04:33,410 --> 04:04:35,230
Oh my god, I saw him!

3523
04:04:36,090 --> 04:04:37,050
Fucking freak!

3524
04:04:38,450 --> 04:04:39,010
Freak!

3525
04:04:39,230 --> 04:04:41,330
Get away from those Endermen!

3526
04:04:46,970 --> 04:04:48,410
I saw him.

3527
04:04:52,040 --> 04:04:54,240
Get your hands away from those Endermen!

3528
04:04:57,260 --> 04:04:58,960
I wonder if there's any in the furnace.

3529
04:04:59,540 --> 04:05:00,760
Oh no, it's just Olivia.

3530
04:05:03,940 --> 04:05:05,900
I'm missing... oh, there's another one.

3531
04:05:06,620 --> 04:05:08,520
Oh, there's one back there in the brewing stand.

3532
04:05:08,660 --> 04:05:08,880
Okay.

3533
04:05:13,460 --> 04:05:15,740
Why you need to make two, you freak?

3534
04:05:18,380 --> 04:05:19,660
Why do you have two?

3535
04:05:22,820 --> 04:05:25,320
There are no rules against the Endermen.

3536
04:05:30,250 --> 04:05:30,690
Alright.

3537
04:05:44,990 --> 04:05:47,010
I'll be smart.

3538
04:05:50,490 --> 04:05:53,550
Just find the one that literally looks like him.

3539
04:05:58,770 --> 04:06:00,050
Oh, I get it.

3540
04:06:00,110 --> 04:06:03,170
I'll craft and then he'll be like, I did it!

3541
04:06:03,490 --> 04:06:05,810
I knew I could make them smart.

3542
04:06:09,870 --> 04:06:13,570
There's no laws against the Endermen, Gabriel.

3543
04:06:15,570 --> 04:06:19,210
Batman, there's no laws against the Endermen, Gabriel.

3544
04:06:23,750 --> 04:06:25,610
Zylo, thank you for the superchat.

3545
04:06:25,730 --> 04:06:27,030
Thank you, thank you.

3546
04:06:34,950 --> 04:06:36,030
Joker, stop.

3547
04:06:36,270 --> 04:06:36,910
Stop, Joker.

3548
04:06:42,410 --> 04:06:43,310
Wait, what?

3549
04:06:43,370 --> 04:06:44,450
I won't take a boy.

3550
04:06:44,710 --> 04:06:45,930
Give me your block.

3551
04:06:48,910 --> 04:06:52,170
Give it to me.

3552
04:06:55,530 --> 04:06:56,670
It's mine.

3553
04:06:56,970 --> 04:06:57,710
My block.

3554
04:07:00,430 --> 04:07:01,770
My block.

3555
04:07:06,780 --> 04:07:07,840
That's right.

3556
04:07:09,720 --> 04:07:11,240
My block.

3557
04:07:12,480 --> 04:07:13,820
But it's just that easy.

3558
04:07:14,140 --> 04:07:20,440
Oh, I don't think he happy.

3559
04:07:21,260 --> 04:07:23,100
Oh, he's definitely not happy.

3560
04:07:23,340 --> 04:07:24,620
Wait, I'll show you where he is.

3561
04:07:24,660 --> 04:07:25,820
He's like right over there.

3562
04:07:26,780 --> 04:07:27,700
Wait, they're dancing.

3563
04:07:30,200 --> 04:07:31,420
Joker, stop.

3564
04:07:32,560 --> 04:07:34,320
He's like... Wait, where is he?

3565
04:07:36,260 --> 04:07:38,200
He's like... Wait, where did he go?

3566
04:07:39,640 --> 04:07:41,340
I saw him out that window.

3567
04:07:45,480 --> 04:07:46,960
No, it'll be fine.

3568
04:07:47,140 --> 04:07:48,800
Oh, he's still jumping around.

3569
04:07:48,920 --> 04:07:50,720
He's like... Where'd my block go?

3570
04:07:51,880 --> 04:07:52,940
Wait, where is he?

3571
04:07:53,240 --> 04:07:55,560
I swear, he was like next to the crafter.

3572
04:07:58,400 --> 04:07:59,120
It's fine.

3573
04:07:59,380 --> 04:08:00,520
I remember how to build it.

3574
04:08:05,020 --> 04:08:06,800
Okay, two, four, five, six.

3575
04:08:06,860 --> 04:08:07,100
Okay.

3576
04:08:08,320 --> 04:08:09,120
I remember this.

3577
04:08:13,140 --> 04:08:15,960
Oh my god, he's gonna be like... I did it.

3578
04:08:17,000 --> 04:08:18,040
I taught him how.

3579
04:08:18,060 --> 04:08:19,560
I taught them how to build.

3580
04:08:26,660 --> 04:08:27,320
Wait, no.

3581
04:08:28,980 --> 04:08:29,660
Wait, what?

3582
04:08:34,860 --> 04:08:35,680
Yeah, remove this.

3583
04:08:35,880 --> 04:08:37,600
Yeah, I was gonna say, why did it place it there?

3584
04:08:42,060 --> 04:08:43,280
You think he's looking?

3585
04:08:45,160 --> 04:08:47,980
Okay, I'll do like all that and I wanna see if he's looking.

3586
04:08:47,980 --> 04:08:49,760
Do you think he was watching?

3587
04:08:51,380 --> 04:08:52,260
Where is he?

3588
04:08:57,670 --> 04:08:58,650
Where is he?

3589
04:08:59,930 --> 04:09:01,430
I can't find him.

3590
04:09:03,290 --> 04:09:03,770
No, I know.

3591
04:09:03,850 --> 04:09:06,050
I just wanna see if... I just wanna see if I can find him.

3592
04:09:09,430 --> 04:09:10,750
He's gonna be so proud.

3593
04:09:22,950 --> 04:09:23,670
What?

3594
04:09:40,290 --> 04:09:43,550
Oh yeah, he definitely looks like he abandoned Iron Man.

3595
04:09:47,730 --> 04:09:48,870
Poor dude.

3596
04:10:07,150 --> 04:10:07,550
Yeah.

3597
04:10:07,630 --> 04:10:09,410
Yeah, you upset in his hair.

3598
04:10:26,770 --> 04:10:27,110
What do you need me for?

3599
04:10:28,510 --> 04:10:30,550
Even so, what do you need me for?

3600
04:10:31,090 --> 04:10:33,790
I've gone out of my way to avoid these types of problems.

3601
04:10:33,970 --> 04:10:36,130
We have to save the world.

3602
04:10:36,590 --> 04:10:38,110
I don't even remember what it looks like up there.

3603
04:10:38,430 --> 04:10:39,730
Help me save the world.

3604
04:10:40,190 --> 04:10:40,550
How?

3605
04:10:41,330 --> 04:10:42,510
The Formida Bomb.

3606
04:10:43,050 --> 04:10:43,890
The F-bomb.

3607
04:10:47,470 --> 04:10:50,030
He's like, but my lovers...

3608
04:10:50,030 --> 04:10:51,910
They need me.

3609
04:10:53,350 --> 04:10:54,750
I can't leave them.

3610
04:10:54,750 --> 04:10:56,730
You don't need me.

3611
04:10:57,190 --> 04:10:58,410
You need my stuff.

3612
04:10:59,650 --> 04:11:03,010
I found that when you give people what they want, they turn on you.

3613
04:11:03,970 --> 04:11:05,770
They become resentful.

3614
04:11:06,510 --> 04:11:07,610
Has someone done that before?

3615
04:11:08,050 --> 04:11:09,050
Yeah, who doesn't?

3616
04:11:09,050 --> 04:11:09,230
All of them!

3617
04:11:09,970 --> 04:11:11,670
It's why I prefer Endermen.

3618
04:11:12,010 --> 04:11:14,750
They always do what you expect, almost to a fault.

3619
04:11:16,250 --> 04:11:17,090
You're a stranger.

3620
04:11:18,150 --> 04:11:20,310
And what you're asking for is too dangerous.

3621
04:11:21,430 --> 04:11:23,370
I have the amulet.

3622
04:11:23,410 --> 04:11:23,650
What?

3623
04:11:23,650 --> 04:11:25,990
Gabriel gave it to me.

3624
04:11:26,790 --> 04:11:29,530
Gabriel asked me to reassemble the Order of the Stone.

3625
04:11:29,770 --> 04:11:31,390
The Order of the Stone?

3626
04:11:32,070 --> 04:11:33,430
They asked for me?

3627
04:11:33,590 --> 04:11:37,950
I always knew they needed me, but I was never sure if they wanted me.

3628
04:11:39,030 --> 04:11:41,550
It's lonely down here without your friends.

3629
04:11:41,750 --> 04:11:43,130
Eligard is your friend.

3630
04:11:44,190 --> 04:11:46,030
Hmm, I don't know.

3631
04:11:46,450 --> 04:11:47,930
Does she ever talk about me?

3632
04:11:48,350 --> 04:11:49,350
Uh, sure.

3633
04:11:50,010 --> 04:11:52,010
What kinds of things do they say?

3634
04:11:52,970 --> 04:11:53,710
Oh no.

3635
04:11:55,690 --> 04:11:56,550
Give me an example.

3636
04:11:57,230 --> 04:11:58,430
They've missed you?

3637
04:11:58,750 --> 04:11:59,810
That you were missed.

3638
04:12:00,290 --> 04:12:00,690
Really?

3639
04:12:01,410 --> 04:12:02,890
Maybe it was more missing.

3640
04:12:03,350 --> 04:12:04,770
You have to read between the lines.

3641
04:12:05,270 --> 04:12:06,530
Yes, yes you do.

3642
04:12:06,830 --> 04:12:07,750
But what about you?

3643
04:12:08,690 --> 04:12:09,670
Are you my friend?

3644
04:12:10,290 --> 04:12:11,990
As long as we're on the subject.

3645
04:12:12,850 --> 04:12:14,710
Not to put you on the spot.

3646
04:12:14,710 --> 04:12:16,330
Sure, we can be friends!

3647
04:12:17,490 --> 04:12:19,110
That's the best thing I've heard in years.

3648
04:12:19,110 --> 04:12:19,810
Oh no.

3649
04:12:19,990 --> 04:12:21,630
Admittedly, it's not a very high bar.

3650
04:12:21,630 --> 04:12:23,590
Oh, that's so sad, Sorin.

3651
04:12:23,610 --> 04:12:24,790
Don't worry, I'm going to help you.

3652
04:12:24,850 --> 04:12:26,790
Because that's what friends do.

3653
04:12:28,050 --> 04:12:30,250
Before we leave, I'm going to give my old friends a gift.

3654
04:12:30,250 --> 04:12:34,930
Oh no, now I'm committed to a situationship with an Enderman fucker.

3655
04:12:38,730 --> 04:12:42,130
Gary may seem scary, but he's a swell guy.

3656
04:12:42,890 --> 04:12:46,210
Sally dilly-dallies, give her credit she tries.

3657
04:12:46,670 --> 04:12:48,290
They might look the same to the untrained eye.

3658
04:12:48,290 --> 04:12:49,350
That was too easy.

3659
04:12:50,570 --> 04:12:52,530
But that's a lie.

3660
04:12:52,590 --> 04:12:54,330
Alright, let it out!

3661
04:12:57,450 --> 04:13:00,130
Wait, is that?

3662
04:13:00,530 --> 04:13:00,930
Are you?

3663
04:13:01,150 --> 04:13:02,070
He's like, yeah!

3664
04:13:02,630 --> 04:13:02,890
Sorin!

3665
04:13:03,490 --> 04:13:03,710
Whoa.

3666
04:13:05,350 --> 04:13:07,090
Oh my god, he touched my arm.

3667
04:13:11,440 --> 04:13:13,540
You look terrible.

3668
04:13:14,100 --> 04:13:15,360
Terribly handsome?

3669
04:13:17,020 --> 04:13:18,420
Hello, old friend.

3670
04:13:19,840 --> 04:13:20,900
We've been looking for you.

3671
04:13:20,900 --> 04:13:22,480
Wait, Gabriel and Sorin are friends?

3672
04:13:23,200 --> 04:13:24,300
Oh, I should have said Gabriel.

3673
04:13:29,200 --> 04:13:30,380
Wait, how did he get in?

3674
04:13:36,680 --> 04:13:40,760
Wait, how did he get in?

3675
04:13:42,920 --> 04:13:44,200
Who looked at him?

3676
04:13:48,780 --> 04:13:49,940
What did I do?

3677
04:13:49,940 --> 04:13:50,220
What did I do?

3678
04:13:55,030 --> 04:13:57,110
How did I alter his behavior?

3679
04:14:02,610 --> 04:14:04,310
They didn't like that Sorin cheated.

3680
04:14:13,330 --> 04:14:15,250
I took his block.

3681
04:14:15,850 --> 04:14:17,430
It was his favorite block.

3682
04:14:24,430 --> 04:14:25,510
We break the fountain.

3683
04:14:25,630 --> 04:14:26,790
Oh, the fountain, yeah!

3684
04:14:29,730 --> 04:14:30,930
They're scared of water.

3685
04:14:55,930 --> 04:14:56,790
I'm so smart.

3686
04:14:56,870 --> 04:14:57,870
What do you mean Sorin is such?

3687
04:14:57,950 --> 04:14:58,830
I fucking...

3688
04:14:58,830 --> 04:15:00,270
I came up with the plan!

3689
04:15:12,950 --> 04:15:15,390
Exactly, why didn't we make the house two blocks tall?

3690
04:15:18,930 --> 04:15:20,450
It wouldn't hurt me, cause like...

3691
04:15:20,450 --> 04:15:21,510
I have my suit on.

3692
04:15:21,610 --> 04:15:22,450
I can look at him.

3693
04:15:27,770 --> 04:15:28,490
Thanks, Sorin.

3694
04:15:30,530 --> 04:15:31,990
My new best friend.

3695
04:15:35,450 --> 04:15:37,010
Okay, let's break this.

3696
04:15:43,790 --> 04:15:44,670
No, why?

3697
04:15:52,940 --> 04:15:54,380
Oh, we have to break the other one.

3698
04:15:57,340 --> 04:15:58,560
It's okay, we got this.

3699
04:15:58,600 --> 04:15:59,300
I can do it again.

3700
04:15:59,580 --> 04:16:00,340
Watch this.

3701
04:16:03,800 --> 04:16:05,900
I'm fucking Ruben.

3702
04:16:06,920 --> 04:16:08,580
He's like, bath time.

3703
04:16:13,380 --> 04:16:14,420
Bath time.

3704
04:16:16,500 --> 04:16:17,740
What if I just look at him?

3705
04:16:18,200 --> 04:16:18,700
Hey guys.

3706
04:16:20,700 --> 04:16:23,400
So what does Sorin do to you guys?

3707
04:16:23,680 --> 04:16:24,520
Like, actually.

3708
04:16:28,860 --> 04:16:29,460
Alright.

3709
04:16:29,460 --> 04:16:31,820
Time to break the fountain.

3710
04:16:38,580 --> 04:16:39,860
Did that work?

3711
04:16:41,940 --> 04:16:43,060
Oh there, it did it.

3712
04:16:45,420 --> 04:16:47,860
I was using the claws of the Enderman.

3713
04:16:50,640 --> 04:16:52,240
That was taught to me by Sorin.

3714
04:16:54,080 --> 04:16:55,080
See, it worked.

3715
04:16:55,320 --> 04:16:56,520
I told you guys it works.

3716
04:17:04,880 --> 04:17:06,460
What's the hold up?

3717
04:17:10,520 --> 04:17:11,700
There's more?

3718
04:17:15,640 --> 04:17:17,160
Just don't look.

3719
04:17:18,460 --> 04:17:21,520
They're in the Truman Show.

3720
04:17:28,640 --> 04:17:32,420
Oh my god, look at all these background actors we hired.

3721
04:17:35,740 --> 04:17:36,740
The fuck?

3722
04:17:37,060 --> 04:17:37,500
Oh what?

3723
04:17:42,850 --> 04:17:43,310
Okay.

3724
04:17:54,030 --> 04:17:55,530
It's like a conga line.

3725
04:17:57,390 --> 04:17:59,950
Jesus Christ, that is so fucking scary.

3726
04:18:01,030 --> 04:18:03,970
Like, they're all just waiting for us over there.

3727
04:18:05,010 --> 04:18:05,930
Conga-ing.

3728
04:18:13,820 --> 04:18:15,660
They're like...

3729
04:18:15,660 --> 04:18:17,680
You took my block.

3730
04:18:18,320 --> 04:18:19,700
I take your life.

3731
04:18:24,820 --> 04:18:27,260
Are you my block taker?

3732
04:18:31,780 --> 04:18:34,660
They want to join the conga line.

3733
04:18:35,240 --> 04:18:35,420
What?

3734
04:18:38,720 --> 04:18:39,640
Quick!

3735
04:18:40,040 --> 04:18:41,240
Break the bridge!

3736
04:18:42,900 --> 04:18:44,660
Okay, yeah guys, thanks for helping out everyone.

3737
04:18:45,640 --> 04:18:47,340
I really appreciate it.

3738
04:18:54,400 --> 04:18:57,100
Oh, it's a sprinkler!

3739
04:18:59,160 --> 04:18:59,860
Let's instill!

3740
04:19:07,540 --> 04:19:09,260
He didn't want a conga.

3741
04:19:14,360 --> 04:19:16,020
Wait, my flint and steel.

3742
04:19:21,170 --> 04:19:24,770
What's the point of carrying a lighter if I can't use it?

3743
04:19:26,650 --> 04:19:28,050
Oh look, they're dancing.

3744
04:19:39,050 --> 04:19:40,630
Oh shit, that's a lot.

3745
04:19:42,410 --> 04:19:43,190
They're dancing.

3746
04:19:44,190 --> 04:19:45,630
Dance Enderman, dance!

3747
04:19:55,710 --> 04:19:57,330
Don't worry, I'm doing it.

3748
04:19:57,350 --> 04:19:58,110
Wait, can I drown?

3749
04:20:00,850 --> 04:20:04,710
No, I don't want to do this all over again if I do drown.

3750
04:20:06,750 --> 04:20:09,690
We're not gonna force drowning, guys.

3751
04:20:10,090 --> 04:20:11,990
I don't want to do this all over again.

3752
04:20:11,990 --> 04:20:12,410
We're not.

3753
04:20:12,590 --> 04:20:17,950
No, this seems like if I drown, I have to do it a long time.

3754
04:20:20,350 --> 04:20:22,110
Gabriel, Gabriel, no!

3755
04:20:24,010 --> 04:20:27,890
Gabriel, you're dying in front of the team, Gabriel!

3756
04:20:28,330 --> 04:20:30,970
I'm not letting you die in front of me alone!

3757
04:20:32,210 --> 04:20:34,030
It has to be in front of everybody.

3758
04:20:35,230 --> 04:20:36,890
Just like how Lee would have wanted.

3759
04:20:44,120 --> 04:20:46,240
Maximum shock factor, exactly.

3760
04:20:47,120 --> 04:20:48,180
Maximum surprise.

3761
04:20:54,640 --> 04:20:58,340
Because I promised him a surprise and we're getting it.

3762
04:20:59,920 --> 04:21:01,380
Oh shit, they're all here.

3763
04:21:02,800 --> 04:21:04,820
By the way, we broke your mob farmer, Soren.

3764
04:21:05,020 --> 04:21:06,320
This is how you're gonna find out.

3765
04:21:13,280 --> 04:21:14,700
Don't worry, watch this.

3766
04:21:15,680 --> 04:21:16,140
Nevermind.

3767
04:21:20,060 --> 04:21:21,460
Okay.

3768
04:21:23,140 --> 04:21:24,220
Oh shit.

3769
04:21:27,060 --> 04:21:27,760
What?

3770
04:21:27,920 --> 04:21:29,320
You had 20 years!

3771
04:21:38,300 --> 04:21:41,100
Do it!

3772
04:21:43,860 --> 04:21:45,180
Holy shit!

3773
04:21:45,500 --> 04:21:46,260
Wait, that's cool.

3774
04:21:46,400 --> 04:21:47,180
That's actually cool.

3775
04:21:58,900 --> 04:22:00,340
Holy shit!

3776
04:22:01,620 --> 04:22:03,860
You came to the wrong neighborhood.

3777
04:22:11,140 --> 04:22:11,860
Good!

3778
04:22:18,580 --> 04:22:19,940
Pass it.

3779
04:22:20,280 --> 04:22:23,300
Don't ask questions you don't want to know the answers to.

3780
04:22:28,120 --> 04:22:28,800
What?

3781
04:22:32,700 --> 04:22:34,580
Oh, he wants to portal up.

3782
04:22:43,380 --> 04:22:46,360
Okay guys, we can piss him off, guys.

3783
04:22:56,520 --> 04:22:58,800
Guys, we can't.

3784
04:22:58,860 --> 04:23:00,320
He's... Guys, you don't understand.

3785
04:23:01,740 --> 04:23:02,480
I saw him.

3786
04:23:03,140 --> 04:23:04,820
I think he fucks Enderman, guys.

3787
04:23:05,080 --> 04:23:10,020
I... He can... I think he has like no boundaries, guys.

3788
04:23:10,140 --> 04:23:11,760
We cannot piss Soren off.

3789
04:23:16,500 --> 04:23:17,180
Oh shit.

3790
04:23:17,380 --> 04:23:17,440
Oh shit.

3791
04:23:19,440 --> 04:23:22,280
There's a... He has no boundaries, guys.

3792
04:23:22,520 --> 04:23:23,980
I don't want to piss him off.

3793
04:23:24,900 --> 04:23:26,360
He's capable of anything.

3794
04:23:31,530 --> 04:23:34,150
Yeah, he'll do anything at this point.

3795
04:23:42,220 --> 04:23:43,480
Wait, what?

3796
04:23:51,900 --> 04:23:52,340
Haha.

3797
04:23:56,740 --> 04:23:57,480
Oh my god.

3798
04:23:57,600 --> 04:23:58,880
Okay, we're gonna save this, guys.

3799
04:23:59,160 --> 04:23:59,880
It's fixable.

3800
04:24:00,000 --> 04:24:00,920
Guys, it's fixable.

3801
04:24:02,180 --> 04:24:03,360
Guys, it's fixable.

3802
04:24:12,100 --> 04:24:13,620
But he knows.

3803
04:24:14,520 --> 04:24:15,600
He knows about the sickness.

3804
04:24:17,240 --> 04:24:18,680
Oh my goodness.

3805
04:24:22,400 --> 04:24:23,720
Yeah, I totally did.

3806
04:24:26,220 --> 04:24:27,600
Look at that, guys.

3807
04:24:27,660 --> 04:24:28,700
See, I'm fixing it.

3808
04:24:29,080 --> 04:24:29,800
I agreed.

3809
04:24:30,660 --> 04:24:32,280
I did it, guys.

3810
04:24:32,620 --> 04:24:33,480
I agreed.

3811
04:24:40,970 --> 04:24:42,690
I agreed with him.

3812
04:24:45,750 --> 04:24:46,810
Hey, Reuben.

3813
04:24:48,150 --> 04:24:48,730
Yeah.

3814
04:24:55,950 --> 04:24:56,590
Hmm.

3815
04:24:57,750 --> 04:24:58,330
Okay, wait.

3816
04:24:59,250 --> 04:25:00,630
Does Olivia want to talk?

3817
04:25:01,490 --> 04:25:02,230
Wait, where's Olivia?

3818
04:25:02,310 --> 04:25:02,870
Oh, there's Olivia.

3819
04:25:10,830 --> 04:25:13,730
Just take everything.

3820
04:25:16,470 --> 04:25:17,430
Doesn't hurt.

3821
04:25:18,630 --> 04:25:19,990
Just take it all.

3822
04:25:19,990 --> 04:25:22,150
Okay, now I'll press the lever.

3823
04:25:22,890 --> 04:25:24,190
I just need to press the button, right?

3824
04:25:24,490 --> 04:25:26,870
Jesus Christ, what sort of system does he have?

3825
04:25:29,590 --> 04:25:30,030
Alright.

3826
04:25:30,890 --> 04:25:31,650
I'm ready.

3827
04:25:35,440 --> 04:25:36,740
Oh, there's the minecart.

3828
04:25:49,030 --> 04:25:51,450
Okay, that is not how redstone works, but okay.

3829
04:26:04,050 --> 04:26:04,690
Yeah.

3830
04:26:06,530 --> 04:26:07,590
Your new best friend.

3831
04:26:20,410 --> 04:26:21,690
Let's build...

3832
04:26:21,690 --> 04:26:22,370
Let's do it.

3833
04:26:28,310 --> 04:26:29,890
Yeah, what's the recipe?

3834
04:26:41,430 --> 04:26:42,150
Huh?

3835
04:26:47,710 --> 04:26:49,590
Oh, so we have to build them?

3836
04:26:50,890 --> 04:26:55,090
We have to build it while we're on the witherstorm.

3837
04:26:57,690 --> 04:27:01,830
That's just a TNT with a fancy resource.

3838
04:27:06,350 --> 04:27:10,090
We destroy the...

3839
04:27:11,630 --> 04:27:12,710
Yeah.

3840
04:27:14,410 --> 04:27:15,810
Oh.

3841
04:27:26,190 --> 04:27:28,030
To the minecarts, everyone!

3842
04:27:42,870 --> 04:27:44,890
Things will be fine, right?

3843
04:27:46,590 --> 04:27:47,670
See, they don't know.

3844
04:27:48,290 --> 04:27:50,850
They already forgot that, you know, we took their blocks.

3845
04:27:51,010 --> 04:27:52,670
Because there's... What the fuck?

3846
04:27:56,270 --> 04:27:59,970
Oh, he knows the sins you've committed, Soren.

3847
04:28:04,290 --> 04:28:08,070
The endermen are like, we know what you did.

3848
04:28:13,610 --> 04:28:16,350
You know who you are.

3849
04:28:19,530 --> 04:28:21,850
Where they left?

3850
04:28:29,610 --> 04:28:30,290
What?

3851
04:28:30,290 --> 04:28:30,610
Wait.

3852
04:28:31,250 --> 04:28:31,930
See,

3853
04:28:40,230 --> 04:28:41,290
you guys looked there together.

3854
04:28:41,790 --> 04:28:42,630
I knew it.

3855
04:28:43,230 --> 04:28:43,630
Oh, shit.

3856
04:28:47,010 --> 04:28:47,690
What?

3857
04:28:50,890 --> 04:28:52,850
My hands are off the keyboard.

3858
04:28:53,130 --> 04:28:54,130
I thought we were still watching.

3859
04:28:55,130 --> 04:28:56,990
My hands are off the keyboard.

3860
04:28:59,110 --> 04:29:00,730
Oh, the witherstorm.

3861
04:29:03,670 --> 04:29:04,830
It's time.

3862
04:29:04,830 --> 04:29:05,910
Soren?

3863
04:29:18,130 --> 04:29:18,150
Oh.

3864
04:29:19,770 --> 04:29:20,830
No, the horses!

3865
04:29:21,630 --> 04:29:23,170
Someone free the horses!

3866
04:29:40,250 --> 04:29:40,930
Gabriel!

3867
04:29:53,610 --> 04:29:54,290
Alright.

3868
04:29:54,950 --> 04:29:56,310
I shall be a hero.

3869
04:29:56,830 --> 04:29:58,890
They shall write stories about me.

3870
04:29:59,310 --> 04:30:02,330
And it won't be written out just like Igor.

3871
04:30:05,110 --> 04:30:05,610
Or Eva.

3872
04:30:05,610 --> 04:30:07,490
Wait, what's his name again?

3873
04:30:10,330 --> 04:30:14,010
I already forgot his name.

3874
04:30:17,510 --> 04:30:18,230
Igor.

3875
04:30:27,790 --> 04:30:30,290
Oh my god, I finally have armor.

3876
04:30:37,650 --> 04:30:39,610
No, I'm taking the fucking...

3877
04:30:40,770 --> 04:30:43,710
I'm taking the fucking TNT armor.

3878
04:30:44,090 --> 04:30:48,830
If I'm handling TNT, why the fuck would I take an engineer armor?

3879
04:30:53,530 --> 04:30:56,410
Yeah, take the... why would I take the armor?

3880
04:30:56,410 --> 04:30:59,490
I'm going to have to set down a crafting table out there and make that formidable.

3881
04:30:59,790 --> 04:31:01,730
Everyone else, grab a buddy and split up.

3882
04:31:02,110 --> 04:31:03,690
We need to keep that witherstorm on track.

3883
04:31:03,890 --> 04:31:05,110
So build, build, build.

3884
04:31:05,730 --> 04:31:05,730
You see?

3885
04:31:06,410 --> 04:31:09,090
Don't forget, super TNT in the middle.

3886
04:31:09,370 --> 04:31:11,070
And gunpowder all around.

3887
04:31:11,270 --> 04:31:12,290
No one tell her.

3888
04:31:20,840 --> 04:31:23,500
Okay, I'll have TNT resistance now.

3889
04:31:24,740 --> 04:31:26,340
That's right, I'm gonna be a hero.

3890
04:31:28,100 --> 04:31:28,580
Woo!

3891
04:31:28,580 --> 04:31:29,580
I

3892
04:31:33,060 --> 04:31:35,140
hope this works.

3893
04:31:38,660 --> 04:31:40,480
What the fuck?

3894
04:31:50,360 --> 04:31:51,180
Oh.

3895
04:31:52,160 --> 04:31:54,340
This and then...

3896
04:31:56,320 --> 04:31:58,660
All the TNT powder around it.

3897
04:32:01,940 --> 04:32:03,960
Oh my god.

3898
04:32:04,840 --> 04:32:06,340
It's going crazy.

3899
04:32:10,610 --> 04:32:12,150
Don't worry, I've got it.

3900
04:32:13,750 --> 04:32:14,470
I'm swimming.

3901
04:32:15,650 --> 04:32:17,490
If he's gonna eat me.

3902
04:32:19,070 --> 04:32:20,530
He's gonna eat a bomb.

3903
04:32:22,170 --> 04:32:23,370
Okay, I got it.

3904
04:32:24,850 --> 04:32:26,190
Mid-air crafting.

3905
04:32:28,750 --> 04:32:29,690
Oh shit.

3906
04:32:33,170 --> 04:32:35,250
Okay, he still has hearts, guys.

3907
04:32:36,010 --> 04:32:36,970
Still has hearts.

3908
04:32:39,210 --> 04:32:39,930
Guys.

3909
04:32:39,930 --> 04:32:42,290
Guys, he didn't poop into air.

3910
04:32:42,430 --> 04:32:42,970
He's okay.

3911
04:32:46,650 --> 04:32:48,230
He's fine, he didn't poop.

3912
04:32:49,730 --> 04:32:51,130
He didn't poop!

3913
04:32:51,970 --> 04:32:53,070
No way!

3914
04:33:01,260 --> 04:33:02,940
Oh my god, the F-bomb.

3915
04:33:03,420 --> 04:33:05,140
Oh my god, wait, it's a command block.

3916
04:33:07,700 --> 04:33:08,480
Take it.

3917
04:33:09,480 --> 04:33:09,980
Oh.

3918
04:33:12,420 --> 04:33:14,960
See, look, he's not there.

3919
04:33:15,600 --> 04:33:16,820
He's just sleeping, guys.

3920
04:33:19,040 --> 04:33:20,320
He's just sleeping.

3921
04:33:22,360 --> 04:33:23,200
Oh shit.

3922
04:33:29,900 --> 04:33:33,100
I saw green and I thought that was him, but I realized it was Axel.

3923
04:33:38,720 --> 04:33:39,880
Wait, did we do it?

3924
04:33:39,880 --> 04:33:41,060
Are we heroes?

3925
04:33:48,260 --> 04:33:51,420
Did we beat him?

3926
04:34:02,940 --> 04:34:07,800
Wait, where's Magnus?

3927
04:34:10,940 --> 04:34:13,800
I couldn't have done it without you, Lucas.

3928
04:34:14,400 --> 04:34:15,300
Oh, all of us.

3929
04:34:15,380 --> 04:34:19,040
Okay, I was just trying to compliment Lucas.

3930
04:34:21,960 --> 04:34:23,440
Guys, where's Magnus?

3931
04:34:25,540 --> 04:34:26,800
Guys, where is he?

3932
04:34:35,960 --> 04:34:36,480
Wait.

3933
04:34:36,480 --> 04:34:37,940
Oh no.

3934
04:34:39,360 --> 04:34:39,900
Magnus?

3935
04:34:48,120 --> 04:34:52,800
Give him- someone give him a golden apple, quick!

3936
04:34:56,560 --> 04:34:57,640
Magnus!

3937
04:35:01,640 --> 04:35:03,080
Magnus, no!

3938
04:35:05,320 --> 04:35:06,920
I'm so sad.

3939
04:35:08,200 --> 04:35:11,580
Can we have five booms, please?

3940
04:35:18,680 --> 04:35:19,820
No!

3941
04:35:24,340 --> 04:35:25,460
Please!

3942
04:35:25,700 --> 04:35:28,400
Someone give him some apples!

3943
04:35:31,620 --> 04:35:34,080
Someone feed him!

3944
04:35:38,380 --> 04:35:39,660
Wait, what does he mean by that?

3945
04:35:41,100 --> 04:35:42,420
Wait, what does he mean by that?

3946
04:35:48,520 --> 04:35:50,500
Oh, were these all the people trapped inside?

3947
04:35:54,640 --> 04:35:56,140
Long live the boom.

3948
04:35:58,040 --> 04:35:59,600
Thank you, the superchat.

3949
04:35:59,720 --> 04:36:00,620
Thank you, thank you.

3950
04:36:00,620 --> 04:36:01,200
Thank you.

3951
04:36:05,260 --> 04:36:07,560
I'll save them all.

3952
04:36:08,060 --> 04:36:09,700
I'm not leaving you.

3953
04:36:29,790 --> 04:36:32,310
That was the best sound.

3954
04:36:37,400 --> 04:36:39,930
What was that sound effect?

3955
04:36:41,870 --> 04:36:42,370
No!

3956
04:36:43,570 --> 04:36:45,510
Sorry, the sound effect.

3957
04:36:45,690 --> 04:36:47,090
The thud sound effect.

3958
04:36:49,250 --> 04:36:56,350
When I said, doom the yaoi, I didn't think that would be it!

3959
04:36:57,010 --> 04:36:59,030
It was doomed all along!

3960
04:37:02,890 --> 04:37:04,510
I can't believe it.

3961
04:37:06,510 --> 04:37:08,050
We did it, Patrick!

3962
04:37:08,510 --> 04:37:08,670
We did it!

3963
04:37:08,910 --> 04:37:09,670
Save the city!

3964
04:37:09,850 --> 04:37:11,490
X-Heroes, thank you for the superchat!

3965
04:37:11,670 --> 04:37:12,770
Thank you, thank you!

3966
04:37:14,550 --> 04:37:14,830
No!

3967
04:37:22,990 --> 04:37:24,230
The yaoi!

3968
04:37:26,230 --> 04:37:28,490
I can't believe it!

3969
04:37:28,610 --> 04:37:30,550
We lost the best character!

3970
04:37:30,550 --> 04:37:30,850
Patrick!

3971
04:37:39,640 --> 04:37:41,800
Don't worry, I'm a hero now.

3972
04:37:44,020 --> 04:37:45,340
Wait, just rip it out.

3973
04:37:57,780 --> 04:37:59,480
What is going on?

3974
04:38:03,640 --> 04:38:03,960
Huh?

3975
04:38:07,720 --> 04:38:09,300
No, I wanna be absorbed.

3976
04:38:10,200 --> 04:38:11,900
Let me be absorbed.

3977
04:38:13,180 --> 04:38:14,960
Be one with the block.

3978
04:38:15,640 --> 04:38:17,180
Oh shit, okay, nevermind.

3979
04:38:18,720 --> 04:38:19,620
Hey, you're alive?

3980
04:38:22,840 --> 04:38:24,580
I wanna be one with the block.

3981
04:38:33,640 --> 04:38:34,440
Huh?

3982
04:38:40,540 --> 04:38:41,780
Wait, what?

3983
04:38:48,490 --> 04:38:50,990
This died for no reason?

3984
04:38:58,410 --> 04:39:00,090
Oh no, we separated them.

3985
04:39:00,170 --> 04:39:00,910
That's even worse.

3986
04:39:04,710 --> 04:39:05,730
Wait, she's sick?

3987
04:39:07,390 --> 04:39:11,910
Oh, she doesn't remember.

3988
04:39:11,910 --> 04:39:12,430
Oh man.

3989
04:39:14,690 --> 04:39:16,570
She got way too sick.

3990
04:39:18,790 --> 04:39:22,230
Oh no, we separated all of them.

3991
04:39:27,510 --> 04:39:28,350
Where's my army?

3992
04:39:29,910 --> 04:39:32,110
Where the fuck is my army?

3993
04:39:33,710 --> 04:39:35,570
I died for it.

3994
04:39:43,690 --> 04:39:45,950
Untangle bitter rivalries.

3995
04:39:46,210 --> 04:39:53,830
And find the strength to make one last stand against the storm.

3996
04:40:00,200 --> 04:40:01,800
Oh my god.

3997
04:40:02,640 --> 04:40:04,020
How many episodes?

3998
04:40:04,240 --> 04:40:05,660
We have two more, right?

3999
04:40:06,120 --> 04:40:10,420
Okay, episode four is incredibly long from what I've heard, right guys?

4000
04:40:12,400 --> 04:40:14,180
We have episode four.

4001
04:40:16,080 --> 04:40:17,340
Episode five.

4002
04:40:20,280 --> 04:40:21,260
Episode six?

4003
04:40:24,800 --> 04:40:25,920
Episode seven?

4004
04:40:26,860 --> 04:40:27,840
Wait, I thought...

4005
04:40:28,820 --> 04:40:29,600
Wait, what?

4006
04:40:32,200 --> 04:40:34,320
Oh, for this story arc.

4007
04:40:34,460 --> 04:40:34,740
Oh!

4008
04:40:36,900 --> 04:40:37,740
Oh!

4009
04:40:38,440 --> 04:40:40,080
Okay, okay, I got a little confused.

4010
04:40:40,120 --> 04:40:40,900
So how long...

4011
04:40:41,900 --> 04:40:45,280
How long is episode four?

4012
04:40:47,940 --> 04:40:50,340
How long is this last one?

4013
04:40:53,140 --> 04:40:55,840
What is a story...what is...

4014
04:40:56,640 --> 04:41:01,020
Episode four is eight hours long?!

4015
04:41:01,020 --> 04:41:02,420
Oh, two hours, okay.

4016
04:41:02,920 --> 04:41:05,880
Okay, I was gonna say...

4017
04:41:07,120 --> 04:41:09,200
Okay, it's two hours.

4018
04:41:09,960 --> 04:41:11,840
Guys, alright, do you think...

4019
04:41:12,880 --> 04:41:15,280
Guys, do we finish it?

4020
04:41:15,340 --> 04:41:16,300
Do we finish it, guys?

4021
04:41:17,180 --> 04:41:18,240
Do we finish it?

4022
04:41:19,120 --> 04:41:22,160
I was gonna freak out if I was gonna...

4023
04:41:22,160 --> 04:41:26,340
I was gonna be like, guys, I don't know if I'm strong enough for that.

4024
04:41:26,660 --> 04:41:28,680
I don't know.

4025
04:41:29,860 --> 04:41:30,980
For Magnus?

4026
04:41:31,080 --> 04:41:32,960
Okay, we'll do it for Magnus, guys.

4027
04:41:33,460 --> 04:41:35,680
Alright, for Magnus.

4028
04:41:36,220 --> 04:41:37,400
We finish the arc.

4029
04:41:38,680 --> 04:41:40,380
Okay, let me grab some ice cream then.

4030
04:41:40,540 --> 04:41:42,280
If we're gonna finish this, I need some ice cream.

4031
04:41:42,400 --> 04:41:43,020
I'll be right back.

4032
04:41:43,560 --> 04:41:44,700
Yeah, my voice is okay.

4033
04:41:45,160 --> 04:41:46,560
I just wanna get ice cream then.

4034
04:41:46,940 --> 04:41:47,760
We're gonna finish it.

4035
04:42:12,300 --> 04:42:13,720
Yeah, I have tonado!

4036
04:42:14,280 --> 04:42:16,620
I have the dark...

4037
04:42:16,620 --> 04:42:17,980
Oh, I should've seen that!

4038
04:42:18,100 --> 04:42:19,460
Thank you for the 20 gifted!

4039
04:42:20,000 --> 04:42:21,220
Thank you, thank you!

4040
04:42:22,620 --> 04:42:24,180
Is it for the V-card thing?

4041
04:42:24,420 --> 04:42:25,800
I heard about that.

4042
04:42:26,820 --> 04:42:28,500
Grace, thank you for the super chat!

4043
04:42:28,580 --> 04:42:29,280
Thank you, thank you!

4044
04:42:29,280 --> 04:42:30,460
We have to keep going.

4045
04:42:30,560 --> 04:42:32,820
I'm invested in this story now!

4046
04:42:33,500 --> 04:42:34,120
Thank you for the super chat!

4047
04:42:34,240 --> 04:42:35,000
Thank you, thank you!

4048
04:42:35,440 --> 04:42:36,820
Eleanor Rice, thank you for the super chat!

4049
04:42:36,920 --> 04:42:37,640
Thank you, thank you!

4050
04:42:38,360 --> 04:42:40,840
Basically, it's like...

4051
04:42:41,880 --> 04:42:43,840
He's pulling V-cards.

4052
04:42:44,260 --> 04:42:47,380
And like, if he gets any of the cards...

4053
04:42:47,380 --> 04:42:51,340
I think it was like, any of the best cards...

4054
04:42:51,340 --> 04:42:53,080
The level 3... I don't know the term.

4055
04:42:53,160 --> 04:42:55,760
The level 3 cards, then he's going over there to chat and give subs.

4056
04:42:55,760 --> 04:42:57,700
So I assume he got one of mine.

4057
04:42:59,900 --> 04:43:01,020
Thank you!

4058
04:43:01,240 --> 04:43:03,120
I'm playing Minecraft story mode right now.

4059
04:43:03,600 --> 04:43:05,320
Alright, the last episode.

4060
04:43:05,880 --> 04:43:08,160
I can't believe Magnus is dead.

4061
04:43:08,640 --> 04:43:10,460
I can't believe it!

4062
04:43:10,700 --> 04:43:12,100
This is the last episode.

4063
04:43:14,860 --> 04:43:17,180
I just... I was thinking about 5 gifted ships!

4064
04:43:17,320 --> 04:43:18,200
Thank you, thank you!

4065
04:43:20,320 --> 04:43:21,760
Yeah, the trading cards.

4066
04:43:28,780 --> 04:43:30,600
Like, he died for nothing!

4067
04:43:31,960 --> 04:43:34,980
And then we turned it into 3 withers!

4068
04:43:38,760 --> 04:43:41,240
She should've let me get absorbed by the wither.

4069
04:43:41,620 --> 04:43:45,600
If she let me get absorbed by the command block...

4070
04:43:45,600 --> 04:43:47,280
I could've been like, slash exit.

4071
04:43:51,060 --> 04:43:53,020
Slash delete or some shit.

4072
04:43:53,660 --> 04:43:54,660
Or slash kick all.

4073
04:43:57,460 --> 04:44:02,900
I have the... what's that Italian ice cream called that's like vanilla with like the little chocolate bits in there?

4074
04:44:04,000 --> 04:44:04,920
Or gelato?

4075
04:44:07,260 --> 04:44:07,920
Oh no!

4076
04:44:17,060 --> 04:44:18,100
Nah, stretchatella!

4077
04:44:18,420 --> 04:44:19,040
I got that.

4078
04:44:21,720 --> 04:44:22,860
I love gelato.

4079
04:44:24,200 --> 04:44:26,440
I can't believe we just basically made him stronger.

4080
04:44:39,290 --> 04:44:41,810
Slash jump at you!

4081
04:44:43,630 --> 04:44:45,470
I could've done that!

4082
04:44:49,490 --> 04:44:50,890
The thing's not dead!

4083
04:44:58,390 --> 04:45:01,590
Oh wait, she doesn't know I didn't pick her!

4084
04:45:02,670 --> 04:45:04,090
We're saved!

4085
04:45:05,890 --> 04:45:06,770
We're saved!

4086
04:45:08,350 --> 04:45:09,330
We're coming!

4087
04:45:12,670 --> 04:45:13,310
She doesn't know!

4088
04:45:13,930 --> 04:45:15,130
We just need Gabriel to die.

4089
04:45:19,670 --> 04:45:21,110
Omni, thank you for the superchat!

4090
04:45:21,230 --> 04:45:22,230
Thank you, trade!

4091
04:45:22,530 --> 04:45:23,130
Big trade!

4092
04:45:26,610 --> 04:45:27,930
She wouldn't know.

4093
04:45:30,090 --> 04:45:31,250
I did it!

4094
04:45:34,890 --> 04:45:36,090
Look out!

4095
04:45:40,050 --> 04:45:41,250
Oh shit!

4096
04:45:42,210 --> 04:45:42,650
What?

4097
04:45:43,130 --> 04:45:44,310
What are the endermen doing?

4098
04:45:45,290 --> 04:45:46,010
They'll be killed!

4099
04:45:46,630 --> 04:45:48,750
Sorry, I can't stand by and watch.

4100
04:45:49,050 --> 04:45:50,830
I'd be condemning them to death!

4101
04:45:51,550 --> 04:45:52,630
He's like, my ways!

4102
04:45:53,410 --> 04:45:54,870
These endermen are running directly into danger!

4103
04:45:54,870 --> 04:45:56,130
My ways!

4104
04:45:56,190 --> 04:45:59,350
You're putting us in danger every second you just stand there!

4105
04:45:59,350 --> 04:45:59,810
No!

4106
04:46:04,910 --> 04:46:06,010
The harem!

4107
04:46:21,910 --> 04:46:23,450
Let's build a portal!

4108
04:46:25,490 --> 04:46:26,970
Do we have...

4109
04:46:26,970 --> 04:46:29,030
Do we have the materials?

4110
04:46:31,730 --> 04:46:33,410
Does anyone have obsidian?

4111
04:46:33,890 --> 04:46:36,330
One of the hardest materials to get right now!

4112
04:46:36,610 --> 04:46:38,170
Does anyone have obsidian?

4113
04:46:51,760 --> 04:46:53,280
It's okay, they're already tamed.

4114
04:46:53,460 --> 04:46:54,180
We should be fine.

4115
04:46:54,180 --> 04:46:55,980
Slow down, horse!

4116
04:46:57,060 --> 04:46:58,580
Yeah, yeah, let me on you!

4117
04:47:00,620 --> 04:47:02,180
Wait, what about us?

4118
04:47:03,380 --> 04:47:05,040
Come on, Jesse, we got this!

4119
04:47:06,040 --> 04:47:06,880
Leave them!

4120
04:47:06,920 --> 04:47:08,820
We'll take the reins, and they can just hang on!

4121
04:47:09,380 --> 04:47:10,080
I'll take Gabriel!

4122
04:47:10,420 --> 04:47:11,300
Then I've got Petra!

4123
04:47:13,800 --> 04:47:16,340
I don't know about you, but she has red eyes right now!

4124
04:47:16,800 --> 04:47:19,340
She's like, closer to turning than Gabriel!

4125
04:47:19,920 --> 04:47:24,840
I feel like she's gonna bite Lucas at any moment!

4126
04:47:27,480 --> 04:47:30,000
I'm just gonna take Gabriel!

4127
04:47:31,940 --> 04:47:34,900
Bro, she has red eyes!

4128
04:47:35,400 --> 04:47:36,620
She is not!

4129
04:47:36,640 --> 04:47:38,160
She is fucking turning!

4130
04:47:40,820 --> 04:47:43,180
I am not risking that!

4131
04:47:44,780 --> 04:47:45,280
Slap!

4132
04:47:46,120 --> 04:47:46,740
Whoa!

4133
04:47:48,140 --> 04:47:50,160
Oh my god, he's on a spider!

4134
04:47:52,040 --> 04:47:53,160
She's fine!

4135
04:47:53,280 --> 04:47:54,100
I'm gonna slap this one!

4136
04:47:54,460 --> 04:47:54,880
Slap!

4137
04:47:56,220 --> 04:47:58,700
I'm going to all of them just to slap them!

4138
04:47:59,020 --> 04:47:59,620
Chicken Jockey!

4139
04:48:00,480 --> 04:48:01,380
Get absorbed!

4140
04:48:05,620 --> 04:48:08,700
I'm making sure the other mobs get absorbed!

4141
04:48:14,280 --> 04:48:15,220
Alright, jump!

4142
04:48:23,220 --> 04:48:24,260
That's right!

4143
04:48:24,280 --> 04:48:28,320
I made sure to slap all of these!

4144
04:48:29,540 --> 04:48:31,180
Don't worry, are there any other mobs?

4145
04:48:37,280 --> 04:48:37,960
Oh?

4146
04:48:39,740 --> 04:48:40,420
Oh?

4147
04:48:41,080 --> 04:48:43,280
His people need him!

4148
04:48:44,260 --> 04:48:45,280
Oh shit!

4149
04:48:45,460 --> 04:48:46,080
Oh fuck!

4150
04:48:46,320 --> 04:48:46,700
Oh no!

4151
04:48:47,740 --> 04:48:48,420
Sorry!

4152
04:48:48,940 --> 04:48:51,680
I was looking at the Endermen and eating my ice cream!

4153
04:48:54,960 --> 04:48:55,880
Okay, nice.

4154
04:48:56,020 --> 04:48:57,120
I don't want to redo that.

4155
04:48:57,200 --> 04:48:58,240
I had to dodge it all.

4156
04:48:58,700 --> 04:49:01,740
I felt like the game was definitely going to punish me if I died.

4157
04:49:03,980 --> 04:49:04,500
Oh?

4158
04:49:13,260 --> 04:49:14,820
What the fuck?

4159
04:49:20,460 --> 04:49:21,360
Not mine!

4160
04:49:23,580 --> 04:49:24,540
What?

4161
04:49:30,000 --> 04:49:32,680
Build a bridge.

4162
04:49:39,620 --> 04:49:44,220
It does not have to be that wide!

4163
04:49:45,300 --> 04:49:47,780
Why does it have to be that wide?

4164
04:49:48,440 --> 04:49:52,980
Why did Lucas build a front side of the bridge?

4165
04:49:53,500 --> 04:49:56,220
Was that Sorin or Lucas?

4166
04:49:56,960 --> 04:50:00,740
Was that Sorin that built the decoration?

4167
04:50:02,520 --> 04:50:04,440
He's just like, it's got to look pretty.

4168
04:50:07,400 --> 04:50:08,680
It's aesthetic.

4169
04:50:09,520 --> 04:50:12,380
He's like, you don't understand, it's got to look beautiful.

4170
04:50:17,780 --> 04:50:18,640
I don't know.

4171
04:50:30,740 --> 04:50:32,520
Professionals have standards!

4172
04:50:33,960 --> 04:50:37,280
You don't even know who you are!

4173
04:50:48,420 --> 04:50:50,360
A storm did something.

4174
04:50:52,700 --> 04:50:54,040
A storm did something to her.

4175
04:50:54,460 --> 04:50:57,020
So, she doesn't remember anything?

4176
04:50:57,440 --> 04:50:58,300
Not even me?

4177
04:50:58,560 --> 04:50:59,740
Who can forget me?

4178
04:51:01,080 --> 04:51:02,740
Jesse, this is awful.

4179
04:51:04,740 --> 04:51:09,080
You, Jesse, you're the one who rescued me.

4180
04:51:10,060 --> 04:51:11,520
Tell me, please.

4181
04:51:12,060 --> 04:51:12,880
Yeah, it's me.

4182
04:51:13,000 --> 04:51:14,240
I've always rescued you.

4183
04:51:14,440 --> 04:51:17,360
All I remember was endless blackness.

4184
04:51:18,060 --> 04:51:20,380
And then, you were there.

4185
04:51:20,380 --> 04:51:22,340
I thought we lost you.

4186
04:51:26,080 --> 04:51:29,630
I tried so hard to save you.

4187
04:51:29,630 --> 04:51:31,070
I thought I was, too.

4188
04:51:32,630 --> 04:51:35,750
All I know is, I was so scared in there.

4189
04:51:36,690 --> 04:51:38,510
I thought for sure I was dying.

4190
04:51:39,750 --> 04:51:40,430
Well, you didn't.

4191
04:51:40,850 --> 04:51:42,030
You made it back alive.

4192
04:51:43,470 --> 04:51:45,090
We didn't all make it back, though.

4193
04:51:46,410 --> 04:51:47,210
Oh, man.

4194
04:51:48,310 --> 04:51:48,790
Magnus.

4195
04:51:49,690 --> 04:51:51,570
Sadly, he died for nothing.

4196
04:51:52,570 --> 04:51:54,330
Are we talking about Magnus?

4197
04:51:54,470 --> 04:51:55,410
Like, what was the point?

4198
04:51:56,970 --> 04:51:57,930
Oh, Magnus.

4199
04:52:00,450 --> 04:52:02,410
I let her live?

4200
04:52:03,890 --> 04:52:06,210
But Magnus was the cooler one.

4201
04:52:07,350 --> 04:52:09,010
He gave me five boons.

4202
04:52:13,110 --> 04:52:15,010
He wants us to fight.

4203
04:52:16,910 --> 04:52:17,610
It's not my fault.

4204
04:52:17,810 --> 04:52:18,730
It's never my fault, guys.

4205
04:52:24,290 --> 04:52:26,450
No, it wasn't my fault!

4206
04:52:27,930 --> 04:52:29,990
Being emotional is getting us nowhere!

4207
04:52:30,850 --> 04:52:33,190
What I want to know is, what happened out there today?

4208
04:52:33,250 --> 04:52:35,110
He volunteered his armor!

4209
04:52:36,250 --> 04:52:38,110
My instructions were simple.

4210
04:52:39,170 --> 04:52:40,550
You were the one in the middle of everything.

4211
04:52:40,710 --> 04:52:41,610
What went wrong?

4212
04:52:42,310 --> 04:52:43,210
We made it worse.

4213
04:52:44,070 --> 04:52:45,310
Yeah, he got stronger.

4214
04:52:45,390 --> 04:52:46,030
He became three.

4215
04:52:46,270 --> 04:52:47,930
The computer block is still out there, Soren.

4216
04:52:48,750 --> 04:52:49,270
Blast!

4217
04:52:50,270 --> 04:52:53,930
And now, to make matters worse, we've gone from one weatherstorm to three!

4218
04:52:54,350 --> 04:52:56,070
Our plan was a total failure!

4219
04:52:56,290 --> 04:52:57,230
Our plan?

4220
04:52:57,230 --> 04:52:59,230
We cast the foul thing into the abyss.

4221
04:53:00,290 --> 04:53:03,010
Why didn't I destroy that cursed block ages ago?

4222
04:53:03,550 --> 04:53:06,450
So, is the command block controlling all three weatherstorms?

4223
04:53:06,970 --> 04:53:08,370
Why are you asking me?

4224
04:53:08,470 --> 04:53:09,530
You're the master of building!

4225
04:53:09,550 --> 04:53:11,230
Am I expected to know every last thing in the universe?

4226
04:53:12,590 --> 04:53:14,810
I need a moment to think.

4227
04:53:14,890 --> 04:53:16,490
If we don't ask you, who do we ask?

4228
04:53:17,550 --> 04:53:19,270
Is he always like this?

4229
04:53:19,610 --> 04:53:21,030
Oh, I'm his best friend.

4230
04:53:21,030 --> 04:53:21,370
Good idea.

4231
04:53:29,610 --> 04:53:35,850
Oh, it's his group!

4232
04:53:51,630 --> 04:53:53,070
Maybe your friends survived.

4233
04:53:53,390 --> 04:53:53,790
It's time!

4234
04:53:54,090 --> 04:53:54,950
We're fixing it, guys!

4235
04:53:56,210 --> 04:53:57,430
We're fixing it!

4236
04:53:58,710 --> 04:53:59,950
I did it!

4237
04:54:12,430 --> 04:54:14,070
I'm gonna talk to Lucas.

4238
04:54:14,290 --> 04:54:15,250
We gotta fix this.

4239
04:54:17,970 --> 04:54:18,990
Lucas, don't worry.

4240
04:54:19,070 --> 04:54:21,750
I'll do everything I can to save your friends with you.

4241
04:54:24,230 --> 04:54:25,070
I told you.

4242
04:54:25,570 --> 04:54:26,610
I'm going after my friends.

4243
04:54:27,090 --> 04:54:28,590
I thought the other ocelots were dead.

4244
04:54:28,870 --> 04:54:30,810
But if they're not, I need to go find them.

4245
04:54:30,810 --> 04:54:31,070
Oh, wait.

4246
04:54:31,450 --> 04:54:33,650
Look, I am grateful to you guys for bringing me this far.

4247
04:54:34,070 --> 04:54:35,850
But I can't leave them alone out there.

4248
04:54:36,070 --> 04:54:37,870
Not with three weatherstorms raging.

4249
04:54:38,390 --> 04:54:39,930
You can't just up and leave, Lucas.

4250
04:54:40,010 --> 04:54:40,650
You're part of our team.

4251
04:54:40,670 --> 04:54:41,750
Yeah, we need you!

4252
04:54:41,830 --> 04:54:44,310
And you saying that just reminds me that I left my team.

4253
04:54:44,810 --> 04:54:45,650
But, Lucas...

4254
04:54:46,170 --> 04:54:49,090
Look, you and me, we've made a pretty good team so far.

4255
04:54:49,310 --> 04:54:49,750
Look at that!

4256
04:54:49,930 --> 04:54:50,030
I fixed it!

4257
04:54:50,030 --> 04:54:50,710
We can call us friends.

4258
04:54:51,110 --> 04:54:51,430
Guys!

4259
04:54:52,590 --> 04:54:53,590
Guys!

4260
04:54:54,330 --> 04:54:55,870
He called me his friend.

4261
04:54:56,890 --> 04:54:57,170
Wait.

4262
04:54:58,950 --> 04:55:00,170
We are helping them.

4263
04:55:00,390 --> 04:55:01,890
Please stay.

4264
04:55:02,130 --> 04:55:02,350
No!

4265
04:55:03,050 --> 04:55:04,050
No!

4266
04:55:06,930 --> 04:55:07,930
No!

4267
04:55:09,290 --> 04:55:10,290
No!

4268
04:55:10,790 --> 04:55:11,890
I couldn't!

4269
04:55:12,110 --> 04:55:17,750
I couldn't press it in time!

4270
04:55:18,370 --> 04:55:18,950
Lucas!

4271
04:55:18,950 --> 04:55:19,250
Lucas!

4272
04:55:20,050 --> 04:55:21,670
Come back!

4273
04:55:22,630 --> 04:55:23,450
Oh my god!

4274
04:55:23,750 --> 04:55:25,490
I dot, dot, dotted him!

4275
04:55:26,530 --> 04:55:26,970
Lucas!

4276
04:55:32,280 --> 04:55:32,720
Lucas!

4277
04:55:34,100 --> 04:55:42,960
I was like, oh my god!

4278
04:55:43,240 --> 04:55:44,520
We need you!

4279
04:55:46,040 --> 04:55:48,540
Oh my god!

4280
04:55:49,240 --> 04:55:51,260
Lucas, come back!

4281
04:55:55,240 --> 04:55:57,220
Ruben, I fucked up!

4282
04:55:58,420 --> 04:56:00,900
I fucked up, Ruben!

4283
04:56:01,160 --> 04:56:01,560
Hey, buddy.

4284
04:56:01,840 --> 04:56:02,620
You doing okay?

4285
04:56:04,340 --> 04:56:05,840
Of course you are.

4286
04:56:06,720 --> 04:56:09,300
Thank you for the super chat.

4287
04:56:09,520 --> 04:56:10,800
Thank you, thank you.

4288
04:56:11,160 --> 04:56:13,000
I had to press what!

4289
04:56:13,800 --> 04:56:16,180
I dot, dot, dotted!

4290
04:56:18,540 --> 04:56:19,440
Oh my god!

4291
04:56:22,700 --> 04:56:25,380
Thank you for the super chat.

4292
04:56:25,620 --> 04:56:26,500
Thank you, thank you.

4293
04:56:26,920 --> 04:56:28,820
That's my comedic relief.

4294
04:56:28,960 --> 04:56:30,560
Oh, she always punished.

4295
04:56:33,520 --> 04:56:34,920
Oh my god!

4296
04:56:36,220 --> 04:56:38,620
You have Lucas's eyes!

4297
04:56:42,040 --> 04:56:43,780
You're my new Lucas.

4298
04:56:44,000 --> 04:56:45,440
You have his eyes!

4299
04:56:45,920 --> 04:56:47,360
You have his eyes!

4300
04:56:55,760 --> 04:56:56,260
Oh my god.

4301
04:56:56,260 --> 04:56:58,160
Anton, thank you for the super chat.

4302
04:56:58,360 --> 04:56:59,160
Thank you, thank you.

4303
04:56:59,560 --> 04:57:02,760
The two minutes, yeah, is coming from your own keyboard.

4304
04:57:03,520 --> 04:57:04,960
Thank you for the super chat.

4305
04:57:05,360 --> 04:57:06,580
Thank you, thank you.

4306
04:57:09,780 --> 04:57:12,160
Oh my god, I'm such a smartass.

4307
04:57:12,800 --> 04:57:13,860
Not really.

4308
04:57:22,070 --> 04:57:23,490
Okay, he angry.

4309
04:57:24,110 --> 04:57:25,730
What the fuck did I do?

4310
04:57:26,010 --> 04:57:28,270
I didn't do clearly nothing.

4311
04:57:33,970 --> 04:57:36,350
Nexi, thank you for the super chat.

4312
04:57:36,650 --> 04:57:38,010
Thank you, thank you.

4313
04:57:38,390 --> 04:57:40,770
Now all I'm left with is you guys!

4314
04:57:46,310 --> 04:57:46,570
Thank you.

4315
04:58:02,830 --> 04:58:08,990
He jumped off?

4316
04:58:22,530 --> 04:58:23,050
Yes.

4317
04:58:23,050 --> 04:58:27,310
I've never seen a play through of Minecraft story mode as a fumbling boy failure.

4318
04:58:27,910 --> 04:58:29,730
Thank you for the super chat, Micro.

4319
04:58:30,010 --> 04:58:31,170
Thank you, thank you.

4320
04:58:34,070 --> 04:58:35,410
What do we have?

4321
04:58:35,590 --> 04:58:36,750
We have Ruben!

4322
04:58:38,730 --> 04:58:41,250
With no foreshadowing whatsoever.

4323
04:58:47,990 --> 04:58:49,810
Of course you know us.

4324
04:58:50,190 --> 04:58:51,950
We are the Order of the Pig.

4325
04:58:54,410 --> 04:58:55,930
Oh wait, she wasn't there.

4326
04:59:01,330 --> 04:59:03,910
I'm rich, thank you for the five gifted ships.

4327
04:59:04,090 --> 04:59:05,230
Thank you, thank you.

4328
04:59:16,310 --> 04:59:18,210
I couldn't save you.

4329
04:59:23,070 --> 04:59:25,510
I just couldn't.

4330
04:59:26,310 --> 04:59:28,590
I tried.

4331
04:59:32,810 --> 04:59:35,870
All that matters is that I tried.

4332
04:59:38,090 --> 04:59:40,670
She doesn't have to know.

4333
04:59:40,790 --> 04:59:41,870
She doesn't know.

4334
04:59:46,310 --> 04:59:48,170
I tried so hard.

4335
04:59:48,610 --> 04:59:52,050
Ruben, at least I have you, right?

4336
04:59:55,170 --> 04:59:57,090
Okay, hello Gabriel.

4337
05:00:00,850 --> 05:00:02,570
Are you feeling better?

4338
05:00:11,450 --> 05:00:14,730
It's okay, his eyes aren't red yet, so we still have time.

4339
05:00:15,750 --> 05:00:18,390
Lucky bird going after the horse.

4340
05:00:18,810 --> 05:00:22,090
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

4341
05:00:22,090 --> 05:00:24,090
Thank you.

4342
05:00:44,510 --> 05:00:46,950
Okay, you deserve to rest.

4343
05:00:52,850 --> 05:00:54,490
We went so far.

4344
05:01:05,950 --> 05:01:07,950
What did they do to him?

4345
05:01:11,990 --> 05:01:14,950
How the fuck did they do to Ivor?

4346
05:01:18,830 --> 05:01:20,030
We've all made it.

4347
05:01:20,630 --> 05:01:21,650
I'm gonna go quiet.

4348
05:01:23,050 --> 05:01:25,290
I wanna know what the fuck is going on.

4349
05:01:26,290 --> 05:01:28,250
I wanna know the story behind it.

4350
05:01:39,530 --> 05:01:43,190
Wait, since Lucas is gone, I'm just gonna go full chaotic mode now.

4351
05:01:43,800 --> 05:01:46,330
Now it doesn't matter.

4352
05:01:48,750 --> 05:01:50,750
Why am I being nice?

4353
05:01:50,910 --> 05:01:52,090
It doesn't matter anymore.

4354
05:02:02,100 --> 05:02:03,490
Doesn't matter anymore.

4355
05:02:03,830 --> 05:02:05,730
It doesn't matter anymore.

4356
05:02:05,910 --> 05:02:06,990
Why be nice?

4357
05:02:12,380 --> 05:02:14,170
Oh, we gotta save Ruben.

4358
05:02:16,270 --> 05:02:17,490
Ruben, are you okay?

4359
05:02:20,070 --> 05:02:21,110
Yeah, Ruben.

4360
05:02:21,390 --> 05:02:23,510
It's not my fault she's crazy.

4361
05:02:29,180 --> 05:02:30,420
Oh, I helped Gabriel.

4362
05:02:31,240 --> 05:02:32,220
I don't wanna lose you.

4363
05:02:32,620 --> 05:02:33,820
I don't wanna lose you.

4364
05:02:35,240 --> 05:02:36,360
Yeah, Ruben.

4365
05:02:36,360 --> 05:02:39,800
Yeah, I know you've run off before, but things are different now.

4366
05:02:39,880 --> 05:02:41,400
We've lost too many people already.

4367
05:02:43,200 --> 05:02:43,800
Yeah, Ruben.

4368
05:02:43,880 --> 05:02:46,360
After everything that happened...

4369
05:02:47,040 --> 05:02:49,720
The order, the world needs us.

4370
05:02:49,800 --> 05:02:50,880
Just you and me.

4371
05:02:55,960 --> 05:02:57,440
It's okay, Ruben.

4372
05:02:58,980 --> 05:03:04,400
After everything that's happened, I know that you and me will never falter.

4373
05:03:06,380 --> 05:03:08,060
That you and me are forever.

4374
05:03:12,710 --> 05:03:14,050
Sydney, thank you for the superchat.

4375
05:03:14,130 --> 05:03:15,050
Thank you, thank you.

4376
05:03:16,950 --> 05:03:18,010
Wait, why are they arguing?

4377
05:03:18,970 --> 05:03:20,450
I wasn't there to instigate.

4378
05:03:20,530 --> 05:03:21,210
How are they arguing?

4379
05:03:23,170 --> 05:03:24,070
Wait, it's not here?

4380
05:03:24,170 --> 05:03:25,030
Oh, it's with Soren.

4381
05:03:25,150 --> 05:03:25,410
Okay.

4382
05:03:27,570 --> 05:03:29,230
Forever and ever and ever.

4383
05:03:47,470 --> 05:03:49,090
Soren, you need to listen to me.

4384
05:03:50,270 --> 05:03:52,350
Oh, what good has ever come of that?

4385
05:03:56,040 --> 05:03:57,100
Wait, what?

4386
05:03:57,720 --> 05:03:59,540
Come to lock me in another room?

4387
05:04:00,000 --> 05:04:01,120
I came to offer my help.

4388
05:04:01,840 --> 05:04:03,860
He's been following us.

4389
05:04:04,140 --> 05:04:05,440
It's not like that.

4390
05:04:05,840 --> 05:04:07,000
You need to hear me out.

4391
05:04:09,260 --> 05:04:12,760
What you don't understand is you are all in very grave danger.

4392
05:04:16,560 --> 05:04:19,320
No, I mean specifically this group.

4393
05:04:19,540 --> 05:04:22,380
The weatherstorm isn't acting randomly.

4394
05:04:22,680 --> 05:04:24,500
It's following Gabriel.

4395
05:04:24,940 --> 05:04:25,600
Gabriel?

4396
05:04:27,260 --> 05:04:31,540
You see, I may have programmed it to follow his amulet.

4397
05:04:33,540 --> 05:04:35,140
Oh my God, he's slash followed.

4398
05:04:35,660 --> 05:04:37,060
You mean the Order's amulet.

4399
05:04:37,720 --> 05:04:38,380
Yes, Soren.

4400
05:04:39,060 --> 05:04:40,220
That amulet.

4401
05:04:40,220 --> 05:04:43,400
And the reason you didn't tell us that ages ago?

4402
05:04:44,020 --> 05:04:45,720
I'm not required to tell you anything.

4403
05:04:46,260 --> 05:04:49,300
You are when I'm the one he gave the amulet to.

4404
05:04:50,040 --> 05:04:50,500
What?

4405
05:04:51,540 --> 05:04:53,620
I... I didn't know.

4406
05:04:55,240 --> 05:04:56,500
Ivor, you fool.

4407
05:04:56,760 --> 05:05:00,440
You've created a monster that's following Jesse, and it's only getting stronger.

4408
05:05:00,740 --> 05:05:02,080
You don't think I realize that.

4409
05:05:02,480 --> 05:05:04,380
Nothing can stop those things.

4410
05:05:04,860 --> 05:05:05,940
Nothing even hurts them.

4411
05:05:06,580 --> 05:05:08,380
Well, except Enderman.

4412
05:05:08,380 --> 05:05:08,780
Enderman?

4413
05:05:09,840 --> 05:05:10,120
Enderman?

4414
05:05:12,380 --> 05:05:13,440
Jesse's right.

4415
05:05:14,420 --> 05:05:18,480
The wither's gaze passed over them, and they went wild.

4416
05:05:19,580 --> 05:05:25,820
If I had been there with my own eyes, we actually just saw a bunch of Enderman pull blocks off a witherstorm.

4417
05:05:26,040 --> 05:05:33,400
So, the half of them, working together, might be able to destroy a witherstorm entirely.

4418
05:05:34,000 --> 05:05:36,920
It's a promising concept, at least in theory.

4419
05:05:36,920 --> 05:05:38,120
Wait, could you coordinate them?

4420
05:05:40,620 --> 05:05:42,360
Could you coordinate the Enderman somehow?

4421
05:05:42,820 --> 05:05:44,140
Make them attack all at once?

4422
05:05:44,600 --> 05:05:48,380
If I know my Enderman, all we'd need to do is get them into the storm's vicinity.

4423
05:05:48,540 --> 05:05:49,920
Oh, you definitely know your Enderman.

4424
05:05:50,180 --> 05:05:50,660
Don't worry.

4425
05:05:50,780 --> 05:05:51,900
I know that.

4426
05:05:52,400 --> 05:05:54,400
I do not doubt that, sir.

4427
05:05:54,580 --> 05:05:57,360
...an unintended side effect of you flooding the end.

4428
05:05:58,260 --> 05:06:00,020
This is just like the old days, Zoran.

4429
05:06:00,300 --> 05:06:01,700
You and your crazy ideas.

4430
05:06:01,720 --> 05:06:03,740
Hush, Ivor, for once!

4431
05:06:04,620 --> 05:06:07,240
You're the one that summoned the wither!

4432
05:06:07,520 --> 05:06:11,800
If anything, his crazy ideas is just fucking the Enderman.

4433
05:06:12,540 --> 05:06:17,060
Ivor's crazy idea is... wait, we use your fortress.

4434
05:06:18,620 --> 05:06:24,320
His crazy idea is literally just fucking summoning a god that's gonna kill everything.

4435
05:06:24,320 --> 05:06:26,400
We bring the wither storms to the Enderman.

4436
05:06:26,940 --> 05:06:27,820
Just one problem.

4437
05:06:28,300 --> 05:06:30,560
You're forgetting about the command block.

4438
05:06:31,140 --> 05:06:33,740
The original doomed ally.

4439
05:06:34,040 --> 05:06:35,780
It's clear now that no weapon can destroy it.

4440
05:06:36,600 --> 05:06:37,540
Not even a Formidable.

4441
05:06:38,420 --> 05:06:41,720
Actually, I may have a solution to that.

4442
05:06:42,600 --> 05:06:45,520
You see, when I first took possession of the command block...

4443
05:06:45,520 --> 05:06:46,740
You mean stole it?

4444
05:06:47,480 --> 05:06:47,660
Yes, but we fail safe.

4445
05:06:47,660 --> 05:06:49,260
Oh, he got it from...

4446
05:06:50,100 --> 05:06:52,520
A backup plan, just in case.

4447
05:06:52,520 --> 05:06:54,520
Well, I'd say just in case.

4448
05:06:54,620 --> 05:06:55,740
So that's why he's mad.

4449
05:06:55,840 --> 05:06:57,320
He stole the item from him.

4450
05:06:57,560 --> 05:06:58,160
He used him.

4451
05:06:58,860 --> 05:07:00,500
Also, Cookie, welcome to Tomato Farm!

4452
05:07:00,580 --> 05:07:01,160
Welcome, welcome!

4453
05:07:01,680 --> 05:07:04,140
The power of the command block itself.

4454
05:07:04,960 --> 05:07:09,520
Use it to enchant a weapon, and you'll be able to smash the command block to bits.

4455
05:07:10,260 --> 05:07:10,640
Forever!

4456
05:07:11,480 --> 05:07:12,000
Yes.

4457
05:07:12,820 --> 05:07:13,960
Yes, that's it!

4458
05:07:14,520 --> 05:07:16,660
It could very well solve all our problems.

4459
05:07:17,280 --> 05:07:18,400
What are we waiting for?

4460
05:07:18,460 --> 05:07:19,860
Let's go get that book!

4461
05:07:19,860 --> 05:07:21,660
Just one problem.

4462
05:07:22,680 --> 05:07:25,010
It's at my secret lab, which is...

4463
05:07:25,820 --> 05:07:27,360
Oh, you have another secret lab?

4464
05:07:27,620 --> 05:07:28,800
How far could it possibly be?

4465
05:07:29,180 --> 05:07:30,580
How many secret labs does he have?

4466
05:07:30,660 --> 05:07:33,860
It's the farthest place a person can travel before being utterly...

4467
05:07:35,160 --> 05:07:35,700
Huh?

4468
05:07:36,480 --> 05:07:38,240
Oh dear, what was that?

4469
05:07:42,620 --> 05:07:43,160
What?

4470
05:07:48,900 --> 05:07:50,800
How did it find us so quickly?

4471
05:07:51,100 --> 05:07:52,260
Oh, it's our amulet.

4472
05:07:52,380 --> 05:07:53,760
It just keeps coming for us.

4473
05:07:53,760 --> 05:07:55,180
We just threw the amulet away.

4474
05:07:58,140 --> 05:08:00,200
It's following us.

4475
05:08:07,740 --> 05:08:08,980
Punch him!

4476
05:08:13,480 --> 05:08:15,560
Wait, what the fuck?

4477
05:08:16,460 --> 05:08:18,100
What was that interaction?

4478
05:08:18,960 --> 05:08:19,060
What?

4479
05:08:19,480 --> 05:08:20,860
He just like...

4480
05:08:22,000 --> 05:08:22,680
Malady?

4481
05:08:28,040 --> 05:08:31,560
And we're just okay with him now?

4482
05:08:32,640 --> 05:08:35,540
Like, he destroyed the whole world?

4483
05:08:38,760 --> 05:08:39,440
And...

4484
05:08:39,440 --> 05:08:39,980
Wait, why?

4485
05:08:43,120 --> 05:08:43,800
Wait...

4486
05:08:43,800 --> 05:08:44,380
Okay, you're right.

4487
05:08:44,440 --> 05:08:45,160
Here you go, Axel.

4488
05:08:51,340 --> 05:08:52,740
He's like, you could be killed.

4489
05:08:52,820 --> 05:08:53,860
Okay, here you go, Axel.

4490
05:08:57,420 --> 05:08:58,460
I trust you.

4491
05:09:02,920 --> 05:09:04,560
I was like, no, don't do it, Axel!

4492
05:09:04,680 --> 05:09:06,200
And then she's like, you could be killed.

4493
05:09:06,280 --> 05:09:08,300
I was like, okay, you can take it.

4494
05:09:08,740 --> 05:09:09,300
Good choice.

4495
05:09:09,300 --> 05:09:09,680
Yeah!

4496
05:09:14,760 --> 05:09:15,360
Oh,

4497
05:09:19,540 --> 05:09:20,800
so they're not okay anymore.

4498
05:09:21,040 --> 05:09:21,720
What the fuck?

4499
05:09:32,110 --> 05:09:35,210
We need you to take us to your secret lab.

4500
05:09:35,210 --> 05:09:37,190
Hey, Jesse.

4501
05:09:37,730 --> 05:09:40,470
Let's try our handshake again, just once for the road.

4502
05:09:40,590 --> 05:09:42,190
The one where we don't do anything?

4503
05:09:42,770 --> 05:09:43,210
You got it.

4504
05:09:44,370 --> 05:09:45,210
Oh, we gotta rap?

4505
05:09:45,610 --> 05:09:46,170
Oh, well.

4506
05:09:46,830 --> 05:09:48,150
Real heroes don't need handshakes.

4507
05:09:48,230 --> 05:09:48,630
What?

4508
05:09:50,250 --> 05:09:51,990
I'll see you at Sorin's, alright?

4509
05:09:53,030 --> 05:09:54,670
Not if I see you first.

4510
05:09:54,770 --> 05:09:56,010
Was that a quick time event?

4511
05:09:56,410 --> 05:09:58,270
That was a quick time event?

4512
05:09:59,210 --> 05:09:59,710
I...

4513
05:10:01,590 --> 05:10:02,090
I...

4514
05:10:05,210 --> 05:10:10,150
I didn't realize it happened so fast!

4515
05:10:12,270 --> 05:10:14,190
I didn't realize!

4516
05:10:16,730 --> 05:10:18,850
My hands were off the keyboard!

4517
05:10:19,450 --> 05:10:21,530
This is barely a game!

4518
05:10:22,070 --> 05:10:22,890
Like, what?

4519
05:10:23,230 --> 05:10:23,890
Okay.

4520
05:10:28,830 --> 05:10:32,110
This is barely a game!

4521
05:10:32,110 --> 05:10:37,310
Why would my hands be on my keyboard when I'm mostly using my mouse?

4522
05:10:43,780 --> 05:10:46,670
I still managed to fumble.

4523
05:10:55,350 --> 05:10:56,870
Okay, no more.

4524
05:10:56,930 --> 05:10:58,990
We won't be failing unless it's funny.

4525
05:11:05,370 --> 05:11:08,890
Okay, my hands are on the keyboard and mouse now!

4526
05:11:09,010 --> 05:11:09,610
Are you happy?

4527
05:11:15,030 --> 05:11:19,990
Oh my god, the original Doom Yowie right there.

4528
05:11:33,370 --> 05:11:35,010
Oh my god, it's so far.

4529
05:11:35,190 --> 05:11:36,250
His secret lab.

4530
05:11:39,250 --> 05:11:39,790
What is he doing?

4531
05:11:39,810 --> 05:11:41,170
Is he sleeping on Sorin?

4532
05:11:42,010 --> 05:11:44,230
What the fuck is my expression?

4533
05:11:44,550 --> 05:11:47,450
Like, he's like, yeah, I chip it.

4534
05:11:54,450 --> 05:11:58,150
Alright, my hands are still on the keyboard and mouse, guys.

4535
05:12:03,270 --> 05:12:06,290
Yeah, this is definitely very, very far.

4536
05:12:13,830 --> 05:12:14,890
Are we there yet?

4537
05:12:14,890 --> 05:12:16,110
Are we there yet?

4538
05:12:16,250 --> 05:12:21,070
Oh my god.

4539
05:12:21,790 --> 05:12:25,170
Why are we bringing a sick person too with us?

4540
05:12:26,870 --> 05:12:28,910
Like, I'm pretty sure...

4541
05:12:28,910 --> 05:12:33,270
I'm pretty sure she's, like, way far, even further gone than Gabriel.

4542
05:12:33,510 --> 05:12:35,030
Like, her eyes are red.

4543
05:12:35,770 --> 05:12:38,150
Gabriel's eyes are not red yet.

4544
05:12:44,890 --> 05:12:46,590
Feels like we've been riding forever.

4545
05:12:53,050 --> 05:12:54,370
Oh shit.

4546
05:13:06,640 --> 05:13:07,210
Far lands?

4547
05:13:08,410 --> 05:13:10,070
Yeah, what exactly is it?

4548
05:13:35,010 --> 05:13:36,290
Oh shit.

4549
05:13:36,290 --> 05:13:37,470
Oh no, we haven't eaten yet.

4550
05:13:44,990 --> 05:13:46,810
We can't turn back now.

4551
05:14:02,610 --> 05:14:03,210
Wait,

4552
05:14:06,850 --> 05:14:11,070
do we not have food in the... Do we not have food at the laboratory?

4553
05:14:11,210 --> 05:14:12,910
Do you not stock up any food?

4554
05:14:19,850 --> 05:14:21,010
Wait, what the fuck?

4555
05:14:22,270 --> 05:14:23,330
I, like, went backwards.

4556
05:14:24,650 --> 05:14:25,710
Oh my god!

4557
05:14:25,870 --> 05:14:27,010
Oh my god, sorry.

4558
05:14:27,190 --> 05:14:28,330
I'm, like, fucking...

4559
05:14:29,590 --> 05:14:31,530
It's so hard to control this.

4560
05:14:31,630 --> 05:14:31,890
Okay.

4561
05:14:32,570 --> 05:14:37,530
Okay, I have to go down instead of... Like, if I go... If I go...

4562
05:14:38,070 --> 05:14:41,690
Back... I go backwards when I press W and that makes zero sense.

4563
05:14:42,230 --> 05:14:42,870
Oh, there's potato.

4564
05:14:43,610 --> 05:14:44,470
I'm gonna eat it first.

4565
05:14:46,030 --> 05:14:46,630
Potatoes.

4566
05:14:47,530 --> 05:14:49,270
Okay, don't worry guys.

4567
05:14:49,390 --> 05:14:51,530
Clearly, I'll find more for the rest, okay?

4568
05:14:55,230 --> 05:14:58,270
What if I eat all the potatoes though?

4569
05:15:08,470 --> 05:15:10,650
Okay, I'll bring one.

4570
05:15:11,630 --> 05:15:12,990
I'll bring one.

4571
05:15:21,170 --> 05:15:21,850
Okay.

4572
05:15:21,970 --> 05:15:22,770
Okay, I'll bring one.

4573
05:15:23,550 --> 05:15:25,610
But, like, what's over there though?

4574
05:15:25,910 --> 05:15:26,250
Huh?

4575
05:15:33,710 --> 05:15:35,410
Maybe there's food here.

4576
05:15:37,610 --> 05:15:38,170
Oh!

4577
05:15:45,450 --> 05:15:46,130
Yeah.

4578
05:15:49,970 --> 05:15:52,430
Witches hate trespassers.

4579
05:15:52,910 --> 05:15:56,270
Besides, there are plenty of potatoes around.

4580
05:15:57,670 --> 05:15:59,270
Oh, there's a witch.

4581
05:16:03,630 --> 05:16:05,450
We need that cake.

4582
05:16:07,750 --> 05:16:08,530
That's okay.

4583
05:16:09,690 --> 05:16:11,270
It's not like anybody's gonna die.

4584
05:16:13,750 --> 05:16:14,990
We lost Lucas already.

4585
05:16:15,090 --> 05:16:16,550
I'm ready for the bad run.

4586
05:16:21,410 --> 05:16:22,690
We lost Lucas.

4587
05:16:22,930 --> 05:16:24,410
I'm ready for anything.

4588
05:16:30,310 --> 05:16:32,470
Nice, that would be good for something in the future.

4589
05:16:40,170 --> 05:16:40,950
That's right.

4590
05:16:41,110 --> 05:16:42,030
Can't catch me.

4591
05:16:42,850 --> 05:16:44,010
Get out of here, witch!

4592
05:16:44,010 --> 05:16:44,110
Witch!

4593
05:16:47,950 --> 05:16:49,450
Where did Ivor go?

4594
05:16:50,670 --> 05:16:51,630
Wait, he lied!

4595
05:16:53,170 --> 05:16:54,910
He fucking lied!

4596
05:16:59,050 --> 05:16:59,910
Oh, shit!

4597
05:17:01,070 --> 05:17:02,370
He has an army!

4598
05:17:03,130 --> 05:17:04,450
No, the horses!

4599
05:17:15,700 --> 05:17:17,180
Guys, keep going!

4600
05:17:20,720 --> 05:17:23,300
Ivor said the Far Lancer just passed the swamp.

4601
05:17:23,380 --> 05:17:25,040
Wait, where is Ivor?

4602
05:17:25,560 --> 05:17:26,880
I thought he was with you.

4603
05:17:27,860 --> 05:17:29,240
He bailed on me.

4604
05:17:29,240 --> 05:17:30,880
No, he disappeared outside the witch's house.

4605
05:17:30,880 --> 05:17:31,000
Yeah!

4606
05:17:31,340 --> 05:17:32,360
He fucking left!

4607
05:17:34,380 --> 05:17:35,360
Come on!

4608
05:17:38,240 --> 05:17:40,640
Jesus Christ, what the fuck is that range?

4609
05:17:42,320 --> 05:17:44,200
Guys, I think we lost him for...

4610
05:17:45,000 --> 05:17:45,320
Huh?

4611
05:17:46,660 --> 05:17:47,260
Wow!

4612
05:17:47,260 --> 05:17:49,960
You lost him for wow?

4613
05:17:50,240 --> 05:17:50,740
What?

4614
05:17:52,000 --> 05:17:52,600
What?

4615
05:17:53,880 --> 05:17:54,480
Wow.

4616
05:17:56,040 --> 05:17:57,360
Is that the Far Lands?

4617
05:17:58,160 --> 05:18:00,260
It's like we're at the edge of the world.

4618
05:18:00,880 --> 05:18:02,960
Actually, we seem to be at the corner of it.

4619
05:18:03,660 --> 05:18:05,880
Welcome to the Far Lands, my friend.

4620
05:18:06,780 --> 05:18:08,360
Is that a real thing?

4621
05:18:10,640 --> 05:18:11,700
It is?

4622
05:18:12,920 --> 05:18:15,000
I'm glad Jesse snagged this cake.

4623
05:18:15,000 --> 05:18:18,760
Makes the whole wall of insanity thing a lot easier to face.

4624
05:18:19,100 --> 05:18:21,640
I think I like cake.

4625
05:18:21,740 --> 05:18:23,200
Who doesn't like cake?

4626
05:18:25,520 --> 05:18:27,540
Oh, it's an old Minecraft.

4627
05:18:31,600 --> 05:18:32,740
What is it?

4628
05:18:34,300 --> 05:18:35,000
Yeah.

4629
05:18:45,620 --> 05:18:48,060
Very few have seen it in person.

4630
05:18:49,500 --> 05:18:52,520
I'm feeling kinda overwhelmed right now.

4631
05:18:52,880 --> 05:18:53,900
You're not the only one.

4632
05:18:53,940 --> 05:18:54,860
Yeah, how can you live here?

4633
05:18:55,080 --> 05:18:55,840
Why would Ivor live here?

4634
05:18:56,020 --> 05:19:00,540
I mean, it's one thing to build a wool world inside the End, but this?

4635
05:19:01,140 --> 05:19:02,800
Oh, I doubt he lives here.

4636
05:19:03,220 --> 05:19:06,080
He most likely comes here only for his most secretive research.

4637
05:19:06,740 --> 05:19:10,460
Whatever Ivor is hiding in here, it will be extremely well guarded.

4638
05:19:13,840 --> 05:19:15,680
Wait, and then there's like lapis everywhere?

4639
05:19:16,160 --> 05:19:17,460
Or is that like he pre-built?

4640
05:19:17,700 --> 05:19:18,960
Oh, he must have pre-built that.

4641
05:19:19,680 --> 05:19:20,800
Built that in the Far Lands.

4642
05:19:24,520 --> 05:19:24,960
Look.

4643
05:19:25,560 --> 05:19:27,380
I fucked up, okay?

4644
05:19:27,980 --> 05:19:29,040
Not the Axel part.

4645
05:19:29,140 --> 05:19:30,060
Like, I didn't want to die.

4646
05:19:30,520 --> 05:19:30,960
But...

4647
05:19:40,000 --> 05:19:40,880
Is this...

4648
05:19:40,880 --> 05:19:41,580
a maze?

4649
05:19:46,580 --> 05:19:48,060
What the fuck?

4650
05:19:51,780 --> 05:19:54,460
How did he build this with a command block?

4651
05:19:54,560 --> 05:19:55,640
Did he go slash creative?

4652
05:19:56,300 --> 05:19:58,680
Slash change game mode creative?

4653
05:20:03,080 --> 05:20:05,320
Doki dot dot dot.

4654
05:20:05,620 --> 05:20:08,060
No, let's do the maze!

4655
05:20:09,400 --> 05:20:10,260
Let's do it!

4656
05:20:10,360 --> 05:20:12,280
I'm at my chaotic run now.

4657
05:20:12,600 --> 05:20:14,580
This is where the two hours is gonna come from.

4658
05:20:15,760 --> 05:20:17,200
This is the two hours.

4659
05:20:17,580 --> 05:20:19,400
Right here in the maze.

4660
05:20:22,960 --> 05:20:23,480
Slash...

4661
05:20:23,480 --> 05:20:24,300
Oh, gosh.

4662
05:20:24,420 --> 05:20:24,680
Wait.

4663
05:20:25,240 --> 05:20:26,120
Wait a minute.

4664
05:20:26,720 --> 05:20:27,140
Okay, no.

4665
05:20:27,240 --> 05:20:28,300
There's no maze part yet.

4666
05:20:32,070 --> 05:20:32,850
It's fine.

4667
05:20:32,990 --> 05:20:33,210
See?

4668
05:20:37,650 --> 05:20:38,550
It's fine.

4669
05:20:38,690 --> 05:20:39,810
We're fine, guys.

4670
05:20:39,910 --> 05:20:40,090
See?

4671
05:20:40,110 --> 05:20:40,650
Look at that.

4672
05:20:41,310 --> 05:20:42,850
Almost out of the maze.

4673
05:20:51,310 --> 05:20:55,590
The Far Lands may be perilous, but they are indisputably fascinating.

4674
05:20:56,510 --> 05:20:57,430
Stone Wop?

4675
05:20:58,190 --> 05:20:58,650
Waterfall?

4676
05:20:58,850 --> 05:21:00,050
We should probably keep moving.

4677
05:21:02,470 --> 05:21:03,770
Maybe we should go this way, right?

4678
05:21:04,350 --> 05:21:06,150
A stone waterfall, huh?

4679
05:21:07,310 --> 05:21:08,650
Only in the Far Lands.

4680
05:21:10,050 --> 05:21:10,510
Oh, okay.

4681
05:21:10,590 --> 05:21:11,550
It's just the same thing.

4682
05:21:14,830 --> 05:21:16,530
Guys, looks like this is a...

4683
05:21:16,530 --> 05:21:16,710
Oh!

4684
05:21:17,990 --> 05:21:18,450
What?

4685
05:21:19,650 --> 05:21:20,590
There's too many!

4686
05:21:20,810 --> 05:21:21,970
We can't fight them all!

4687
05:21:21,970 --> 05:21:23,370
Everyone, back!

4688
05:21:33,240 --> 05:21:34,020
I'm gonna leap.

4689
05:21:34,220 --> 05:21:36,720
You need to climb when you have a potion of leaping!

4690
05:21:36,880 --> 05:21:37,560
Oh, my God.

4691
05:21:37,640 --> 05:21:38,020
I knew it!

4692
05:21:38,020 --> 05:21:38,940
I told you guys!

4693
05:21:43,780 --> 05:21:45,360
Guys, caught in the vines?

4694
05:21:52,230 --> 05:21:54,310
Well, that worked, I suppose.

4695
05:21:55,090 --> 05:21:55,730
Yeah, I guess.

4696
05:21:55,730 --> 05:21:58,170
Okay, it feels like a waste that I did that.

4697
05:21:59,870 --> 05:22:01,230
But now what do we do?

4698
05:22:01,490 --> 05:22:02,730
We're all separated.

4699
05:22:05,950 --> 05:22:08,930
Let's just head that way and find a place where the pads connect.

4700
05:22:11,670 --> 05:22:13,490
Sure hope they don't get lost in there.

4701
05:22:14,910 --> 05:22:15,770
What about me?

4702
05:22:16,010 --> 05:22:17,110
I don't get lost in there.

4703
05:22:17,130 --> 05:22:18,870
Yeah, I was gonna say, what about me?

4704
05:22:18,970 --> 05:22:20,070
Can I actually fall back down?

4705
05:22:20,370 --> 05:22:21,070
No, I can't.

4706
05:22:21,110 --> 05:22:22,210
Oh, my God!

4707
05:22:22,290 --> 05:22:24,850
I can finally walk a little bit faster!

4708
05:22:24,850 --> 05:22:29,730
It really only took me four episodes.

4709
05:22:30,610 --> 05:22:35,030
I can finally walk a little bit faster, guys.

4710
05:22:35,290 --> 05:22:36,970
Look at me go!

4711
05:22:38,950 --> 05:22:42,090
Wait, no, it's not this way.

4712
05:22:43,630 --> 05:22:44,810
What the fuck?

4713
05:22:46,150 --> 05:22:47,050
Oh, no.

4714
05:22:50,770 --> 05:22:52,610
How do I get there?

4715
05:22:56,590 --> 05:22:57,490
It's not there.

4716
05:22:57,610 --> 05:22:58,170
Maybe here?

4717
05:22:59,910 --> 05:23:00,990
Okay, no, that's a dead end.

4718
05:23:01,890 --> 05:23:03,910
Oh, no, I'm a little lost now.

4719
05:23:04,930 --> 05:23:05,790
A floating land?

4720
05:23:05,870 --> 05:23:06,410
Wait, what?

4721
05:23:14,220 --> 05:23:16,720
Okay, guys, now I know where the two hours are gonna...

4722
05:23:18,200 --> 05:23:18,620
Okay.

4723
05:23:19,280 --> 05:23:20,680
Okay, maybe here?

4724
05:23:24,640 --> 05:23:25,840
Okay, this... no.

4725
05:23:27,280 --> 05:23:28,800
Okay, maybe here?

4726
05:23:29,320 --> 05:23:29,760
No?

4727
05:23:30,060 --> 05:23:31,040
Maybe we go backwards?

4728
05:23:37,050 --> 05:23:38,790
And then from here, we can...

4729
05:23:41,990 --> 05:23:43,510
Maybe we go even back?

4730
05:23:44,550 --> 05:23:45,890
And then we go from here?

4731
05:23:53,530 --> 05:23:54,670
It has to be it, right?

4732
05:23:54,730 --> 05:24:00,350
Yeah, yeah, and then we go from here, and then...

4733
05:24:02,670 --> 05:24:04,290
No, no, no, trust the process!

4734
05:24:05,470 --> 05:24:06,950
Guys, trust the process!

4735
05:24:08,050 --> 05:24:09,390
And then from here...

4736
05:24:11,130 --> 05:24:12,570
See, there's a cutscene!

4737
05:24:12,670 --> 05:24:14,390
That means I'm doing the right thing!

4738
05:24:17,090 --> 05:24:17,930
Look at that!

4739
05:24:19,290 --> 05:24:21,270
We go backwards to go front.

4740
05:24:21,450 --> 05:24:21,850
Get out.

4741
05:24:21,970 --> 05:24:23,550
What the fuck?

4742
05:24:24,650 --> 05:24:25,130
Okay.

4743
05:24:27,850 --> 05:24:29,410
Okay, now I don't have a sword.

4744
05:24:29,990 --> 05:24:32,090
That's a little bit worrisome.

4745
05:24:32,230 --> 05:24:34,870
Okay, we go backwards to go forward, guys.

4746
05:24:35,610 --> 05:24:37,610
Guys, no, no, no, trust the process!

4747
05:24:38,930 --> 05:24:45,390
You go backwards to go forward, and then we go even more backwards, apparently...

4748
05:24:45,970 --> 05:24:51,530
To go forward, guys.

4749
05:24:51,590 --> 05:24:52,230
Look at that!

4750
05:24:58,850 --> 05:25:00,590
Look at that, guys!

4751
05:25:01,990 --> 05:25:03,410
Omni, thank you for the superchat!

4752
05:25:03,490 --> 05:25:04,290
Thank you, thank you!

4753
05:25:04,290 --> 05:25:04,890
See, look!

4754
05:25:04,970 --> 05:25:05,430
They did it!

4755
05:25:05,490 --> 05:25:05,850
Wait, what?

4756
05:25:06,870 --> 05:25:07,430
Yeah, see?

4757
05:25:07,570 --> 05:25:07,890
Look!

4758
05:25:08,050 --> 05:25:09,170
Wait, why are they downstairs?

4759
05:25:10,630 --> 05:25:12,970
A waffa, strange and eldritch phenomenon.

4760
05:25:14,430 --> 05:25:14,750
Ow!

4761
05:25:16,730 --> 05:25:17,510
Okay, there we go.

4762
05:25:21,230 --> 05:25:21,850
Last shot!

4763
05:25:25,830 --> 05:25:26,150
Okay.

4764
05:25:30,480 --> 05:25:31,580
Omni, thank you for the superchat!

4765
05:25:31,680 --> 05:25:32,640
Thank you, thank you!

4766
05:25:32,640 --> 05:25:33,480
Oh.

4767
05:25:34,700 --> 05:25:36,580
Wait, why was Olivia at the bottom?

4768
05:25:37,440 --> 05:25:38,660
Why would they be at the bottom?

4769
05:25:38,800 --> 05:25:40,640
They should be down...downstairs.

4770
05:25:41,480 --> 05:25:42,120
Or upstairs.

4771
05:25:44,360 --> 05:25:46,100
Okay, and then we go this way.

4772
05:25:47,400 --> 05:25:49,540
My god, if only I could run.

4773
05:25:50,300 --> 05:25:54,340
At least I'm moderately...briskly walking this time.

4774
05:25:56,460 --> 05:25:57,640
We go here.

4775
05:26:00,920 --> 05:26:01,920
And then...

4776
05:26:01,920 --> 05:26:02,120
And then here.

4777
05:26:02,720 --> 05:26:03,900
This has to be it, right?

4778
05:26:07,510 --> 05:26:08,230
Is it here?

4779
05:26:10,450 --> 05:26:11,890
Wait, is that...

4780
05:26:11,890 --> 05:26:12,790
Is that a plane?

4781
05:26:20,480 --> 05:26:21,420
Anything in here?

4782
05:26:25,200 --> 05:26:26,860
Yeah, there's a flying machine!

4783
05:26:30,060 --> 05:26:30,580
Wait,

4784
05:26:36,390 --> 05:26:37,870
how do I start the slime ball?

4785
05:26:37,870 --> 05:26:38,870
The...the...

4786
05:26:39,850 --> 05:26:42,370
The slime...the flying machine.

4787
05:26:48,490 --> 05:26:53,430
Wait, where are the rest?

4788
05:26:54,930 --> 05:26:55,930
Where is everybody?

4789
05:26:57,310 --> 05:26:57,730
Yeah!

4790
05:26:58,690 --> 05:26:59,350
Were they together?

4791
05:27:01,190 --> 05:27:02,450
They...they were together!

4792
05:27:04,210 --> 05:27:05,210
I don't trust this.

4793
05:27:05,910 --> 05:27:07,010
I don't think that's her.

4794
05:27:07,150 --> 05:27:08,170
There's no way that's her.

4795
05:27:18,690 --> 05:27:19,770
Let's find the others.

4796
05:27:20,910 --> 05:27:22,210
It's weird that...

4797
05:27:24,770 --> 05:27:26,350
I don't know, why were the others gone?

4798
05:27:26,550 --> 05:27:27,390
Why were they together?

4799
05:27:39,050 --> 05:27:41,450
It's so weird, why were they split up?

4800
05:27:52,250 --> 05:27:54,870
I'll figure it out, don't worry.

4801
05:27:58,110 --> 05:27:59,950
Cause I'm a genius!

4802
05:28:01,750 --> 05:28:02,670
Oh, she's mad.

4803
05:28:03,370 --> 05:28:03,830
Hahaha!

4804
05:28:06,610 --> 05:28:08,390
I have YouTube, Olivia.

4805
05:28:08,710 --> 05:28:09,350
Don't worry.

4806
05:28:13,810 --> 05:28:17,390
Wait, she said that?

4807
05:28:17,610 --> 05:28:18,770
That's fucked!

4808
05:28:19,670 --> 05:28:21,150
Oh my god.

4809
05:28:21,870 --> 05:28:23,930
Yeah, prove her...that's actually fucked.

4810
05:28:24,310 --> 05:28:25,930
I can't believe she said that to me.

4811
05:28:36,050 --> 05:28:36,490
Yeah.

4812
05:28:37,670 --> 05:28:41,430
And two of them...one of them is dead and the other one is slowly dying.

4813
05:28:42,150 --> 05:28:43,730
They're not so great, are they?

4814
05:28:43,830 --> 05:28:46,230
And then, the third one is fucking Enderman.

4815
05:29:04,410 --> 05:29:06,330
True, Order of the Fraud.

4816
05:29:09,670 --> 05:29:12,030
If great, why die?

4817
05:29:13,750 --> 05:29:15,730
And the other guy is just there.

4818
05:29:24,850 --> 05:29:26,930
Stop being a doomer!

4819
05:29:30,890 --> 05:29:32,250
We won!

4820
05:29:32,390 --> 05:29:35,570
We won that building contest!

4821
05:29:38,330 --> 05:29:38,950
Yeah!

4822
05:29:40,490 --> 05:29:42,370
Yeah, Olivia!

4823
05:29:43,770 --> 05:29:45,210
We did that!

4824
05:29:45,450 --> 05:29:49,330
We didn't really save the world, we won the building contest!

4825
05:29:51,970 --> 05:29:54,690
With that 2D creeper, our greatest victory.

4826
05:29:56,030 --> 05:29:57,210
Very hard contest.

4827
05:29:59,230 --> 05:30:01,890
I love this, call them immortal cause they're frauds.

4828
05:30:02,370 --> 05:30:03,530
I fucking hate the immortal.

4829
05:30:09,920 --> 05:30:13,240
Wait a second, I think I see what he was trying to do.

4830
05:30:14,320 --> 05:30:21,320
Jesse, take this piston, craft it into a sticky piston, then place it on the other side of the barge along with a redstone block.

4831
05:30:22,240 --> 05:30:23,400
You got all that?

4832
05:30:23,800 --> 05:30:24,280
No.

4833
05:30:24,580 --> 05:30:25,200
I don't think so.

4834
05:30:28,200 --> 05:30:28,680
What?

4835
05:30:30,460 --> 05:30:30,940
What?

4836
05:30:31,100 --> 05:30:33,720
Ruben, what did she...Ruben, what did she say?

4837
05:30:34,240 --> 05:30:35,520
Ruben, I don't know.

4838
05:30:36,680 --> 05:30:38,120
Ruben, what do I do?

4839
05:30:38,120 --> 05:30:40,120
She's gonna be just fine.

4840
05:30:41,580 --> 05:30:42,840
Ruben, trust me!

4841
05:30:43,000 --> 05:30:43,840
Just need a pep talk.

4842
05:30:45,320 --> 05:30:46,500
Oh my god, okay.

4843
05:30:48,920 --> 05:30:49,400
Oh,

4844
05:30:54,670 --> 05:30:55,370
I did it!

4845
05:30:55,490 --> 05:30:55,870
What?

4846
05:30:56,550 --> 05:30:57,030
Nice.

4847
05:30:57,890 --> 05:30:58,970
I did it.

4848
05:30:59,150 --> 05:31:01,150
I don't know how, but I did...

4849
05:31:01,150 --> 05:31:01,670
Oh, whoops.

4850
05:31:02,850 --> 05:31:03,930
I did it.

4851
05:31:04,190 --> 05:31:04,770
Is that it?

4852
05:31:05,250 --> 05:31:06,050
What else do I have to make?

4853
05:31:09,110 --> 05:31:10,410
What else do I have to make?

4854
05:31:13,940 --> 05:31:15,420
Do I have to make anything else?

4855
05:31:21,610 --> 05:31:22,670
Oh, redstone block?

4856
05:31:22,750 --> 05:31:23,890
Oh, I know how to do that.

4857
05:31:33,250 --> 05:31:33,890
There we go.

4858
05:31:34,050 --> 05:31:34,410
Yay!

4859
05:31:38,810 --> 05:31:42,670
I thought it was block plus red, but then I realized, no, she gave me nine.

4860
05:31:49,470 --> 05:31:50,070
Oh, wait.

4861
05:31:50,490 --> 05:31:50,850
No.

4862
05:31:51,270 --> 05:31:52,730
I thought you would do that for me.

4863
05:31:54,750 --> 05:31:56,470
Wait, do I have to do it myself?

4864
05:31:57,210 --> 05:31:57,930
Oh my god.

4865
05:31:58,110 --> 05:31:58,490
Okay.

4866
05:32:02,370 --> 05:32:03,030
Use.

4867
05:32:08,630 --> 05:32:09,690
I did it.

4868
05:32:12,540 --> 05:32:13,510
I did it.

4869
05:32:21,210 --> 05:32:22,950
Yeah, we did it.

4870
05:32:23,350 --> 05:32:24,630
Wait, what did she do?

4871
05:32:24,630 --> 05:32:24,690
I don't know.

4872
05:32:25,010 --> 05:32:26,350
She just gave me...

4873
05:32:26,350 --> 05:32:29,290
She just told me the items to craft and then I put everything together.

4874
05:32:32,190 --> 05:32:33,230
See, Olivia?

4875
05:32:33,590 --> 05:32:34,950
We're great builders.

4876
05:32:36,190 --> 05:32:37,250
Let's go.

4877
05:32:38,230 --> 05:32:39,810
We build really well.

4878
05:32:45,310 --> 05:32:46,790
Everybody, get on!

4879
05:32:52,510 --> 05:32:53,410
Oh, shit.

4880
05:32:53,530 --> 05:32:54,030
Flint and steel.

4881
05:32:59,180 --> 05:33:00,440
Get on, Jesse!

4882
05:33:02,060 --> 05:33:03,480
What if I miss it?

4883
05:33:04,780 --> 05:33:05,780
Oh, I shouldn't.

4884
05:33:09,000 --> 05:33:11,280
Just watch it fly away.

4885
05:33:14,740 --> 05:33:16,180
Turkey fleas.

4886
05:33:17,260 --> 05:33:19,980
Dot, dot, dot.

4887
05:33:21,460 --> 05:33:22,180
Huh?

4888
05:33:24,600 --> 05:33:25,520
The chicken machine.

4889
05:33:27,940 --> 05:33:29,780
I was like, that's how we make Gabriel!

4890
05:33:31,900 --> 05:33:33,560
Yeah, I kind of remember.

4891
05:33:33,860 --> 05:33:34,100
Wait.

4892
05:33:34,780 --> 05:33:35,880
It's already fading.

4893
05:33:37,320 --> 05:33:37,840
Fading...

4894
05:33:38,580 --> 05:33:40,360
Yeah, that's true.

4895
05:33:40,460 --> 05:33:41,360
That's how we met him.

4896
05:33:41,640 --> 05:33:41,960
Take my advice, Petra.

4897
05:33:42,580 --> 05:33:44,500
Some stories are better left forgotten.

4898
05:33:56,670 --> 05:33:58,490
That was amazing!

4899
05:33:59,330 --> 05:34:00,530
Isn't it amazing?

4900
05:34:02,970 --> 05:34:05,490
Tinkering with the Far Lands is nothing to laugh about.

4901
05:34:06,110 --> 05:34:08,090
Yeah, this is a serious matter!

4902
05:34:20,570 --> 05:34:22,030
Oh, there's like lapis here.

4903
05:34:23,410 --> 05:34:24,550
Wait, that means there's an...

4904
05:34:24,550 --> 05:34:26,370
Oh, because he has to read it for enchantment.

4905
05:34:40,560 --> 05:34:40,960
Alright.

4906
05:34:42,440 --> 05:34:44,300
It could be any one of these books.

4907
05:34:53,940 --> 05:34:55,620
It could be any one of them.

4908
05:34:58,320 --> 05:34:59,120
What about here?

4909
05:35:00,740 --> 05:35:01,560
Oh my God.

4910
05:35:08,720 --> 05:35:09,920
Twenty-four?

4911
05:35:10,100 --> 05:35:12,780
There was not that many potions back then in 2012.

4912
05:35:13,920 --> 05:35:16,160
Or whatever year Telltale went bankrupt.

4913
05:35:32,760 --> 05:35:33,680
Look.

4914
05:35:34,340 --> 05:35:36,040
He had to leave, okay?

4915
05:35:36,240 --> 05:35:38,240
I tried everything I could.

4916
05:35:40,520 --> 05:35:42,280
I had to.

4917
05:35:45,460 --> 05:35:48,500
I did everything I could.

4918
05:35:50,760 --> 05:35:51,820
I had to.

4919
05:35:51,820 --> 05:35:51,840
I had to.

4920
05:35:55,460 --> 05:35:57,080
Dot, dot, dot.

4921
05:36:00,040 --> 05:36:00,560
Everything!

4922
05:36:05,760 --> 05:36:06,740
Jesus Christ.

4923
05:36:06,920 --> 05:36:07,100
Fuck you.

4924
05:36:07,380 --> 05:36:07,680
Yay!

4925
05:36:12,660 --> 05:36:13,180
What?!

4926
05:36:15,480 --> 05:36:17,300
I need milk after that.

4927
05:36:18,380 --> 05:36:20,540
By the way, I meant it because...

4928
05:36:20,540 --> 05:36:21,240
I meant it in a way...

4929
05:36:21,240 --> 05:36:21,820
I have like...

4930
05:36:21,820 --> 05:36:24,380
I don't want to boil water at the moment.

4931
05:36:24,540 --> 05:36:25,140
I don't...

4932
05:36:25,140 --> 05:36:25,560
I don't have...

4933
05:36:25,560 --> 05:36:26,620
Sorry, I just realized.

4934
05:36:27,080 --> 05:36:29,080
I don't want to boil water right now.

4935
05:36:29,140 --> 05:36:29,820
Because I don't have...

4936
05:36:29,820 --> 05:36:30,860
I don't drink tap water.

4937
05:36:30,920 --> 05:36:31,900
I don't drink tap water.

4938
05:36:32,000 --> 05:36:34,160
And the only thing I have in my fridge is milk.

4939
05:36:34,720 --> 05:36:36,800
It's milk or I boil water.

4940
05:36:36,940 --> 05:36:38,280
And I don't want to...

4941
05:36:38,280 --> 05:36:40,560
I don't want to wait for my water.

4942
05:36:42,760 --> 05:36:43,220
I

4943
05:37:03,890 --> 05:37:06,790
don't want to wait for my water to cool down.

4944
05:37:07,050 --> 05:37:07,450
Okay?

4945
05:37:07,990 --> 05:37:08,890
I'm thirsty.

4946
05:37:09,290 --> 05:37:10,630
I'm dehydrated.

4947
05:37:13,210 --> 05:37:14,430
Alright, here we go.

4948
05:37:17,710 --> 05:37:18,210
Alright.

4949
05:37:19,890 --> 05:37:20,810
Alright, Soren.

4950
05:37:28,670 --> 05:37:31,830
Because I don't drink tap water.

4951
05:37:32,030 --> 05:37:32,630
I have to boil it.

4952
05:37:32,690 --> 05:37:33,670
Like, tap water itself.

4953
05:37:33,770 --> 05:37:34,590
I have to boil it.

4954
05:37:36,950 --> 05:37:38,810
Yeah, he's pretty fucking stupid.

4955
05:37:42,570 --> 05:37:45,550
I just never bought a water filtration system.

4956
05:37:48,410 --> 05:37:50,210
That's already something I buy next.

4957
05:37:50,850 --> 05:37:51,890
Wait, why?

4958
05:37:52,450 --> 05:37:54,010
Being an adult is very hard.

4959
05:38:05,970 --> 05:38:06,570
Okay.

4960
05:38:07,110 --> 05:38:07,830
Hey, Ruben.

4961
05:38:08,190 --> 05:38:08,790
You...

4962
05:38:08,790 --> 05:38:09,370
Yipee?

4963
05:38:18,550 --> 05:38:19,150
Okay.

4964
05:38:26,620 --> 05:38:27,220
Okay.

4965
05:38:27,220 --> 05:38:30,440
Wait, boiling water doesn't make the water better?

4966
05:38:31,920 --> 05:38:32,880
Wait, what?

4967
05:38:36,000 --> 05:38:36,580
Wait, what?

4968
05:38:38,380 --> 05:38:40,020
Oh, it does make it better.

4969
05:38:40,200 --> 05:38:41,860
Okay, I'm just getting one guide.

4970
05:38:46,280 --> 05:38:47,260
Damn, thank God.

4971
05:38:48,680 --> 05:38:49,760
Okay, we need to find a lever.

4972
05:38:50,860 --> 05:38:52,160
It has to be in the chest.

4973
05:38:52,280 --> 05:38:53,540
Oh, I have to craft a lever.

4974
05:38:55,220 --> 05:38:57,140
Okay, I was like, there's no way.

4975
05:38:58,320 --> 05:38:59,720
There's no fucking way.

4976
05:39:04,440 --> 05:39:06,280
Okay, I should be able to...

4977
05:39:08,060 --> 05:39:09,420
make a lever, right?

4978
05:39:11,860 --> 05:39:12,300
Okay.

4979
05:39:16,280 --> 05:39:17,060
Stick.

4980
05:39:17,240 --> 05:39:21,120
I don't

4981
05:39:40,630 --> 05:39:41,270
know.

4982
05:39:41,730 --> 05:39:45,350
I'm trying.

4983
05:39:52,510 --> 05:39:57,610
It's like that XQC meme where I just do this and then be like...

4984
05:40:09,460 --> 05:40:11,480
I did it.

4985
05:40:11,980 --> 05:40:12,740
I did it.

4986
05:40:15,380 --> 05:40:17,680
Why did he give me four sticks?

4987
05:40:18,320 --> 05:40:19,440
Oh my God.

4988
05:40:19,540 --> 05:40:22,940
I guess it's because in real Minecraft, it gives you four sticks.

4989
05:40:23,200 --> 05:40:26,400
But still, it just made me more confused.

4990
05:40:29,180 --> 05:40:30,480
First try.

4991
05:40:33,320 --> 05:40:34,960
We did it.

4992
05:40:50,180 --> 05:40:52,230
It was so hard, guys.

4993
05:40:52,350 --> 05:40:53,690
I had so many options.

4994
05:41:02,570 --> 05:41:04,290
More like, why wouldn't you?

4995
05:41:05,710 --> 05:41:07,150
It's because he could.

4996
05:41:11,360 --> 05:41:14,780
He had just too much free time in his hands.

4997
05:41:15,240 --> 05:41:17,020
Oh no, not a tripwire.

4998
05:41:18,500 --> 05:41:18,780
Oh.

4999
05:41:20,300 --> 05:41:21,980
Just pull the lever again.

5000
05:41:27,920 --> 05:41:28,520
Oh.

5001
05:41:28,520 --> 05:41:32,820
Wait, break the lever and then put it...

5002
05:41:32,820 --> 05:41:34,420
put it closer to the wall.

5003
05:41:42,830 --> 05:41:46,250
Me building a secret passage in my solo world.

5004
05:41:47,010 --> 05:41:48,390
Can't they just break the wall?

5005
05:41:48,790 --> 05:41:51,170
We were able to break stone with like, two hits.

5006
05:41:54,090 --> 05:41:54,990
Wait, what?

5007
05:41:56,170 --> 05:41:58,530
Did he like, fucking...

5008
05:41:58,530 --> 05:42:00,250
Did he like, rob the order?

5009
05:42:02,190 --> 05:42:04,090
Wait, that's the egg, right?

5010
05:42:09,190 --> 05:42:10,970
Yeah, that's the ender egg.

5011
05:42:12,150 --> 05:42:14,090
Did I fucking release the dragon?

5012
05:42:16,910 --> 05:42:17,890
Pressure plate.

5013
05:42:21,290 --> 05:42:21,970
Yoink.

5014
05:42:34,610 --> 05:42:36,830
Yeah, but why does he keep all of them?

5015
05:42:39,730 --> 05:42:40,090
Yoink.

5016
05:42:44,630 --> 05:42:45,070
Yeah,

5017
05:42:48,970 --> 05:42:50,110
that is a pressure plate, right?

5018
05:42:56,320 --> 05:42:57,900
Oh, we just take it all.

5019
05:42:58,560 --> 05:42:59,000
Yoink.

5020
05:43:14,100 --> 05:43:14,900
Yoink.

5021
05:43:16,880 --> 05:43:17,680
Yoink.

5022
05:43:17,680 --> 05:43:18,780
Okay, and then the egg.

5023
05:43:21,840 --> 05:43:22,240
Oh.

5024
05:43:37,160 --> 05:43:37,880
Mine.

5025
05:43:39,240 --> 05:43:39,960
Yoink.

5026
05:43:43,780 --> 05:43:44,940
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

5027
05:43:45,080 --> 05:43:45,980
Why does he have the treasures?

5028
05:43:49,360 --> 05:43:50,080
Oh.

5029
05:43:56,920 --> 05:43:59,020
Oh, something happened.

5030
05:44:00,360 --> 05:44:02,240
They'd fuck him over somehow.

5031
05:44:02,240 --> 05:44:02,660
Somehow.

5032
05:44:04,500 --> 05:44:07,900
I don't think they actually let him.

5033
05:44:10,900 --> 05:44:14,280
That's a pretty suspicious answer right there.

5034
05:44:17,190 --> 05:44:17,970
Uh-oh.

5035
05:44:20,630 --> 05:44:21,770
Wait, is it?

5036
05:44:21,950 --> 05:44:22,490
Okay, wait.

5037
05:44:26,770 --> 05:44:28,230
Okay, no, I can't do anything.

5038
05:44:28,550 --> 05:44:29,470
Oh, there's more!

5039
05:44:29,750 --> 05:44:30,230
Okay.

5040
05:44:32,450 --> 05:44:33,270
There's more.

5041
05:44:33,350 --> 05:44:34,030
I didn't see this.

5042
05:44:36,130 --> 05:44:37,910
You can only get these underwater, right?

5043
05:44:54,690 --> 05:44:55,130
Yoink.

5044
05:44:59,250 --> 05:44:59,690
Okay.

5045
05:45:03,070 --> 05:45:04,050
That's all of it?

5046
05:45:12,390 --> 05:45:13,290
What do I have to do here?

5047
05:45:15,010 --> 05:45:16,330
I took all of it.

5048
05:45:18,190 --> 05:45:19,450
Can I talk to the doors?

5049
05:45:19,590 --> 05:45:21,110
Oh, okay, now I can talk to the doors.

5050
05:45:21,890 --> 05:45:22,290
Okay.

5051
05:45:26,010 --> 05:45:26,890
It's locked.

5052
05:45:32,790 --> 05:45:34,710
Not- Oh, there's another one!

5053
05:45:56,890 --> 05:45:57,410
Oh.

5054
05:45:57,590 --> 05:46:00,030
Oh, there's an order to everything.

5055
05:46:01,850 --> 05:46:02,370
Oh!

5056
05:46:08,870 --> 05:46:10,510
Oh, that's- This is easy.

5057
05:46:11,030 --> 05:46:11,930
This is so easy.

5058
05:46:14,330 --> 05:46:15,530
Okay, I figured it out.

5059
05:46:16,350 --> 05:46:18,110
Watch this, guys.

5060
05:46:23,850 --> 05:46:24,650
Bad.

5061
05:46:31,270 --> 05:46:32,830
Yeah, see, guys?

5062
05:46:33,070 --> 05:46:33,470
Oh.

5063
05:46:33,890 --> 05:46:34,370
Oh.

5064
05:46:36,290 --> 05:46:36,590
Um.

5065
05:46:36,590 --> 05:46:36,650
Um.

5066
05:46:50,830 --> 05:46:51,790
Excuse me, wait.

5067
05:46:52,190 --> 05:46:57,910
Okay, I know what- Okay.

5068
05:47:00,430 --> 05:47:02,070
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

5069
05:47:02,170 --> 05:47:04,730
And then- And then it's the block of ice.

5070
05:47:05,170 --> 05:47:06,990
And then- Okay, wait.

5071
05:47:07,470 --> 05:47:08,450
What was the gas here?

5072
05:47:10,290 --> 05:47:10,810
Oh!

5073
05:47:12,090 --> 05:47:12,450
Whoops.

5074
05:47:12,850 --> 05:47:13,990
Whoops, I forgot.

5075
05:47:14,190 --> 05:47:14,430
Okay.

5076
05:47:15,810 --> 05:47:17,010
The gas tears.

5077
05:47:17,130 --> 05:47:18,750
I forgot about the gas tears.

5078
05:47:19,410 --> 05:47:19,650
Okay.

5079
05:47:22,830 --> 05:47:24,070
Look at that.

5080
05:47:26,630 --> 05:47:29,270
I listen- I'm a good listener, guys.

5081
05:47:30,930 --> 05:47:31,530
Look at that.

5082
05:47:32,610 --> 05:47:34,050
I listen.

5083
05:47:34,910 --> 05:47:38,650
And I listen very well.

5084
05:47:42,470 --> 05:47:45,010
Guys, I was a very good listener.

5085
05:47:48,380 --> 05:47:51,460
Yeah, who the fuck goes to the Nether first, exactly?

5086
05:47:52,660 --> 05:47:53,420
What the fuck?

5087
05:48:08,580 --> 05:48:09,720
What's going on?

5088
05:48:19,460 --> 05:48:20,000
Hm.

5089
05:48:28,780 --> 05:48:35,380
Yeah, where's- Yeah, where's Ivor's pillar?

5090
05:48:41,220 --> 05:48:42,840
Ivor's pillar.

5091
05:49:02,660 --> 05:49:03,100
Okay.

5092
05:49:03,320 --> 05:49:03,460
Whoa!

5093
05:49:14,580 --> 05:49:17,000
Okay, I don't think Ivor did all of that.

5094
05:49:19,460 --> 05:49:22,700
I don't think Ivor did all of that, guys.

5095
05:49:22,800 --> 05:49:24,460
That seems very-

5096
05:49:27,500 --> 05:49:29,520
I'm sorry, I didn't think Soren did all that.

5097
05:49:29,760 --> 05:49:33,760
Soren does not seem like a guy that- I don't know.

5098
05:49:33,920 --> 05:49:34,620
He doesn't-

5099
05:49:40,760 --> 05:49:41,320
Soren...

5100
05:49:41,320 --> 05:49:42,520
Why he just pokes?

5101
05:49:42,660 --> 05:49:42,920
Yeah.

5102
05:49:42,920 --> 05:49:43,320
Hm.

5103
05:49:47,020 --> 05:49:49,580
A bit.

5104
05:49:49,780 --> 05:49:49,960
Yeah.

5105
05:49:52,460 --> 05:49:54,220
You did all of that?

5106
05:49:59,740 --> 05:50:00,380
Hm.

5107
05:50:02,240 --> 05:50:03,640
Hm.

5108
05:50:13,150 --> 05:50:15,090
I smell bullshit.

5109
05:50:16,730 --> 05:50:18,570
I don't know.

5110
05:50:24,290 --> 05:50:25,150
Hm.

5111
05:50:25,150 --> 05:50:25,250
Hm.

5112
05:50:29,350 --> 05:50:29,990
Okay, no.

5113
05:50:30,090 --> 05:50:30,630
I didn't want to push.

5114
05:50:30,750 --> 05:50:33,630
Wait, I want to- Unpush.

5115
05:50:33,630 --> 05:50:34,530
Unpush the button!

5116
05:50:36,010 --> 05:50:36,710
Unpush it!

5117
05:50:41,830 --> 05:50:42,890
Wait, I don't want to skip that.

5118
05:50:42,970 --> 05:50:43,610
I get the story.

5119
05:50:45,990 --> 05:50:46,350
No!

5120
05:50:48,050 --> 05:50:48,410
Okay.

5121
05:51:01,090 --> 05:51:01,530
Okay.

5122
05:51:01,670 --> 05:51:02,350
Okay, I fucked it up.

5123
05:51:04,670 --> 05:51:06,270
I fucked it up, guys.

5124
05:51:08,250 --> 05:51:10,410
Yeah, where is Ivor's contribution?

5125
05:51:10,750 --> 05:51:13,090
I feel like- Okay, how do I reset it?

5126
05:51:14,070 --> 05:51:15,110
I fucked it up.

5127
05:51:15,170 --> 05:51:17,810
Okay, I guess I have to press it all to reset it.

5128
05:51:18,530 --> 05:51:19,850
Because I messed it up.

5129
05:51:20,990 --> 05:51:23,610
Okay, I- Ooh, these controls.

5130
05:51:23,930 --> 05:51:24,290
Ooh.

5131
05:51:27,490 --> 05:51:28,990
I'm just gonna press it all.

5132
05:51:30,270 --> 05:51:31,630
Just so I can reset it.

5133
05:51:39,440 --> 05:51:40,720
Alright, so...

5134
05:51:40,720 --> 05:51:42,060
First was the bow.

5135
05:51:43,920 --> 05:51:44,620
The bow.

5136
05:51:49,560 --> 05:51:50,200
Then...

5137
05:51:50,200 --> 05:51:52,720
No, I pressed this button accidentally!

5138
05:51:53,180 --> 05:51:53,660
TNT.

5139
05:51:53,660 --> 05:51:53,880
TNT.

5140
05:51:58,970 --> 05:52:00,850
Then he wrote the thing.

5141
05:52:06,640 --> 05:52:07,240
Then...

5142
05:52:07,240 --> 05:52:08,820
The cannon.

5143
05:52:13,610 --> 05:52:14,810
And then...

5144
05:52:15,430 --> 05:52:16,910
And then the sword.

5145
05:52:20,410 --> 05:52:21,170
There we go.

5146
05:52:26,110 --> 05:52:28,850
Well, it has to be this lever, but how do we get there?

5147
05:52:30,270 --> 05:52:31,150
I know, right?

5148
05:52:31,190 --> 05:52:32,110
There's another door.

5149
05:52:35,430 --> 05:52:36,410
Where is this other door?

5150
05:52:36,550 --> 05:52:37,590
Oh, wait, it's over here.

5151
05:52:37,670 --> 05:52:39,270
Okay, I was like, where did I open that?

5152
05:52:42,170 --> 05:52:42,950
Hello, Reuben.

5153
05:52:48,310 --> 05:52:48,990
Yeah, Reuben.

5154
05:52:52,790 --> 05:52:53,850
God damn it, Reuben.

5155
05:52:54,150 --> 05:52:55,690
What am I gonna do with you?

5156
05:52:58,550 --> 05:52:58,830
Wait.

5157
05:52:59,710 --> 05:53:01,090
Oh my God, I was like, where am I?

5158
05:53:02,290 --> 05:53:03,530
I'm like, where am I?

5159
05:53:03,530 --> 05:53:05,290
How do we get up there?

5160
05:53:06,570 --> 05:53:06,990
No!

5161
05:53:12,190 --> 05:53:12,630
Please.

5162
05:53:15,210 --> 05:53:16,950
I don't wanna hear it!

5163
05:53:18,030 --> 05:53:19,250
Soren, stop!

5164
05:53:26,050 --> 05:53:26,930
Okay.

5165
05:53:26,930 --> 05:53:27,030
Okay.

5166
05:53:29,990 --> 05:53:30,590
Please.

5167
05:53:30,850 --> 05:53:31,710
Two sec...

5168
05:53:31,710 --> 05:53:33,390
In like, two sentences.

5169
05:53:35,150 --> 05:53:36,810
But how do we get up there?

5170
05:53:40,390 --> 05:53:41,630
Is there a way to get up?

5171
05:53:48,080 --> 05:53:48,680
What?

5172
05:53:50,600 --> 05:53:51,880
How do I get up?

5173
05:53:53,100 --> 05:53:54,460
The door is here.

5174
05:53:58,010 --> 05:54:00,690
It's right here, but I can't...

5175
05:54:01,460 --> 05:54:04,250
Guys, the door is right there.

5176
05:54:05,710 --> 05:54:06,710
Oh, wait.

5177
05:54:06,830 --> 05:54:07,750
Oh, what?

5178
05:54:08,690 --> 05:54:10,130
I didn't see this.

5179
05:54:12,710 --> 05:54:15,330
I thought it was decoration.

5180
05:54:19,560 --> 05:54:20,770
Oh, it is decoration.

5181
05:54:21,630 --> 05:54:22,950
It is!

5182
05:54:24,610 --> 05:54:25,990
Oh, there you go.

5183
05:54:27,050 --> 05:54:27,590
The assist.

5184
05:54:28,530 --> 05:54:30,110
It was decoration.

5185
05:54:46,430 --> 05:54:49,510
What do we enchant, though?

5186
05:54:50,970 --> 05:54:51,930
Yeah, what?

5187
05:54:55,430 --> 05:54:56,850
How is he at four?

5188
05:54:56,850 --> 05:54:56,910
Where?

5189
05:55:05,290 --> 05:55:05,990
Wait...

5190
05:55:12,570 --> 05:55:13,970
Soren...

5191
05:55:15,610 --> 05:55:18,350
The Ender Dragon was never dead.

5192
05:55:24,550 --> 05:55:25,250
Aww...

5193
05:55:29,210 --> 05:55:31,370
Wait, but how do we get the egg?

5194
05:55:36,310 --> 05:55:36,590
What?

5195
05:55:36,750 --> 05:55:39,390
I want the truth and nothing but the truth!

5196
05:55:41,930 --> 05:55:43,730
Wait, how do we get the...

5197
05:55:43,730 --> 05:55:46,310
They cheat with the command block!

5198
05:55:47,010 --> 05:55:48,970
Slash give Ender Dragon.

5199
05:55:53,210 --> 05:55:54,950
They just slash delete Ender Dragon.

5200
05:55:55,690 --> 05:55:58,910
Guys, is it obvious that I might not know how to use command blocks?

5201
05:56:01,590 --> 05:56:03,590
Is it sort of obvious?

5202
05:56:04,990 --> 05:56:06,190
Slash kill.

5203
05:56:06,490 --> 05:56:09,210
Slash despawn Ender Dragon.

5204
05:56:12,070 --> 05:56:14,210
They slash kill!

5205
05:56:14,970 --> 05:56:17,570
Oh my god, what?

5206
05:56:19,750 --> 05:56:22,150
They slash killed the Ender Dragon!

5207
05:56:25,150 --> 05:56:26,190
Bullshit!

5208
05:56:29,730 --> 05:56:33,230
Oh my god, they did slash creative mode!

5209
05:56:34,890 --> 05:56:38,610
They did slash game mode creative!

5210
05:56:39,070 --> 05:56:40,970
They made themselves admins!

5211
05:56:57,550 --> 05:56:59,790
They are frauds!

5212
05:57:08,770 --> 05:57:11,390
Slash despawn Ender Dragon!

5213
05:57:20,630 --> 05:57:22,290
He did slash!

5214
05:57:22,390 --> 05:57:24,330
Oh my god, I said it as a joke!

5215
05:57:24,810 --> 05:57:27,590
He did slash despawn Ender Dragon!

5216
05:57:37,550 --> 05:57:39,090
You're a cheat!

5217
05:57:45,270 --> 05:57:47,470
Oh my god, his order of the frauds!

5218
05:57:55,490 --> 05:57:57,210
What do you mean Soren?

5219
05:57:57,750 --> 05:57:59,570
He was there too!

5220
05:58:12,210 --> 05:58:12,610
What?

5221
05:58:13,590 --> 05:58:15,190
Wait, is that why he left the order?

5222
05:58:33,990 --> 05:58:36,050
Oh, that's true.

5223
05:58:42,510 --> 05:58:45,270
Ivor didn't do anything wrong!

5224
05:58:46,110 --> 05:58:47,730
Thank you for the superchat!

5225
05:58:47,990 --> 05:58:48,750
Thank you, thank you!

5226
05:58:48,890 --> 05:58:52,430
Oh my god, validation for Koon right there!

5227
05:58:52,570 --> 05:58:54,890
He always believed in Rasputin Corps!

5228
05:58:56,770 --> 05:58:58,710
You're a mad man!

5229
05:59:04,030 --> 05:59:04,890
What?

5230
05:59:16,390 --> 05:59:18,510
I almost forgot for a moment.

5231
05:59:20,370 --> 05:59:21,830
We have to destroy it!

5232
05:59:32,590 --> 05:59:35,390
That's why Magnus wanted to feel like a real hero.

5233
05:59:39,850 --> 05:59:44,170
Okay, so how do I use the book?

5234
05:59:47,330 --> 05:59:48,890
My god, Ivor!

5235
05:59:49,230 --> 05:59:51,350
Koon, thank you for the superchat!

5236
05:59:51,530 --> 05:59:52,210
Thank you, thank you!

5237
05:59:58,050 --> 06:00:03,350
I said there's a trick to use slash despawn Ender Dragon and they actually did that!

5238
06:00:16,570 --> 06:00:18,310
Okay, what does he have in his chest?

5239
06:00:23,310 --> 06:00:25,050
Oh shit, nice!

5240
06:00:25,430 --> 06:00:26,170
I got diamonds!

5241
06:00:30,270 --> 06:00:34,190
Wait, anything?

5242
06:00:46,950 --> 06:00:47,790
Anything?

5243
06:00:49,310 --> 06:00:51,250
Okay, how do I do this?

5244
06:01:09,570 --> 06:01:11,250
Guys, I can mine!

5245
06:01:17,610 --> 06:01:20,010
It's Minecraft, guys!

5246
06:01:20,190 --> 06:01:21,850
Oh my god, I can do...

5247
06:01:21,850 --> 06:01:25,310
Oh my god, I can enchant it with Fortune 3!

5248
06:01:28,410 --> 06:01:28,930
Okay.

5249
06:01:31,830 --> 06:01:32,670
My god.

5250
06:01:33,730 --> 06:01:35,930
It's time to mine!

5251
06:01:37,610 --> 06:01:38,870
It's mine time!

5252
06:01:39,370 --> 06:01:41,610
It's Minecraft time!

5253
06:01:49,650 --> 06:01:51,850
What the mines of Wither?

5254
06:01:52,490 --> 06:01:55,850
It's made of blocks, it makes sense!

5255
06:02:03,590 --> 06:02:06,930
Wait, okay, I'm keeping... Guys, I have to...

5256
06:02:07,630 --> 06:02:10,730
I have to keep with Magnus' armor, guys.

5257
06:02:12,230 --> 06:02:14,050
I'll keep Magnus' armor.

5258
06:02:15,170 --> 06:02:17,910
Or he would have died for fucking nothing.

5259
06:02:20,930 --> 06:02:24,510
Yeah, I was gonna say, he literally dies for nothing if I don't.

5260
06:02:26,770 --> 06:02:28,470
But he's a fraud!

5261
06:02:29,770 --> 06:02:32,270
It's the only time he can redeem himself.

5262
06:02:34,110 --> 06:02:38,190
I like my fucking pickaxe!

5263
06:02:41,170 --> 06:02:43,550
It's time to mine!

5264
06:02:46,850 --> 06:02:48,490
I'm ready!

5265
06:02:52,740 --> 06:02:54,720
My weapon!

5266
06:02:56,120 --> 06:02:57,560
Oh my god, look at the Endermen!

5267
06:03:02,640 --> 06:03:03,900
Jesus Christ.

5268
06:03:10,920 --> 06:03:12,320
What?

5269
06:03:14,740 --> 06:03:16,140
What?

5270
06:03:16,200 --> 06:03:16,780
Oh, he's alive!

5271
06:03:24,640 --> 06:03:25,860
Where's the amulet?

5272
06:03:25,960 --> 06:03:26,180
Yeah.

5273
06:03:30,300 --> 06:03:34,280
Why are they angry?

5274
06:03:37,500 --> 06:03:38,900
God!

5275
06:03:44,740 --> 06:03:49,640
They're just sure like that.

5276
06:03:54,860 --> 06:03:58,920
We fight till the death!

5277
06:04:01,580 --> 06:04:03,560
That's right!

5278
06:04:07,300 --> 06:04:09,700
We all die tonight!

5279
06:04:20,300 --> 06:04:21,660
Either or!

5280
06:04:29,120 --> 06:04:31,460
Oh my gosh, it's my blue-eyed horse.

5281
06:04:31,580 --> 06:04:32,640
It reminds me of him.

5282
06:04:37,180 --> 06:04:39,840
Okay, how do I make the Endermen hangy?

5283
06:04:53,180 --> 06:04:54,300
I'm ready!

5284
06:05:14,440 --> 06:05:16,040
Sorin, what do your wives say?

5285
06:05:17,920 --> 06:05:19,800
Sorin, I said to her at death, Sorin!

5286
06:05:19,800 --> 06:05:21,860
Sorin!

5287
06:05:22,320 --> 06:05:22,580
What?

5288
06:05:24,580 --> 06:05:26,820
Oh, fucking coward!

5289
06:05:28,300 --> 06:05:29,260
You coward!

5290
06:05:31,380 --> 06:05:33,100
I thought we were best friends!

5291
06:05:36,120 --> 06:05:41,200
Oh, he cares, guys.

5292
06:05:41,900 --> 06:05:44,480
He would actually care, guys.

5293
06:05:45,320 --> 06:05:46,960
It is doomed.

5294
06:05:50,400 --> 06:05:53,020
He actually cares.

5295
06:05:57,700 --> 06:06:00,660
Oh, when the thing's on him, he gets angry.

5296
06:06:11,000 --> 06:06:11,740
That's right.

5297
06:06:12,440 --> 06:06:13,240
I stare!

5298
06:06:16,220 --> 06:06:17,460
Get mad!

5299
06:06:17,460 --> 06:06:17,540
Get mad!

5300
06:06:20,200 --> 06:06:21,620
Break my down!

5301
06:06:22,040 --> 06:06:24,320
Jesus Christ, I'm so...

5302
06:06:24,320 --> 06:06:25,640
What the fuck?

5303
06:06:26,160 --> 06:06:27,900
I wish you could actually do that in Minecraft.

5304
06:06:28,200 --> 06:06:30,680
Slap a block out of an Enderman's head.

5305
06:06:33,380 --> 06:06:34,480
That's right!

5306
06:06:35,960 --> 06:06:37,020
Get mad!

5307
06:06:39,800 --> 06:06:41,680
Mask up, Jesse!

5308
06:06:41,680 --> 06:06:44,000
Yes, they're falling for it.

5309
06:06:46,660 --> 06:06:50,000
What happens if I...

5310
06:06:52,300 --> 06:06:53,640
Oh, I just...

5311
06:06:54,380 --> 06:06:56,720
I just walked away.

5312
06:06:59,400 --> 06:07:01,920
I was like, what happens if I don't do it?

5313
06:07:02,540 --> 06:07:02,800
Okay.

5314
06:07:05,300 --> 06:07:06,840
One of them.

5315
06:07:07,780 --> 06:07:08,260
What?

5316
06:07:08,660 --> 06:07:09,560
Oh, okay, that helped.

5317
06:07:09,680 --> 06:07:10,120
That worked.

5318
06:07:12,500 --> 06:07:15,000
Okay, so I have to do as many as I can.

5319
06:07:17,860 --> 06:07:19,360
Or it won't work.

5320
06:07:21,840 --> 06:07:23,140
Why don't I just push them?

5321
06:07:26,820 --> 06:07:28,720
What the fuck is that pig gonna do?

5322
06:07:31,020 --> 06:07:32,460
Yeah, that's right, nerd!

5323
06:07:34,500 --> 06:07:35,740
What the fuck?

5324
06:07:36,860 --> 06:07:37,780
Give me a locker.

5325
06:07:37,780 --> 06:07:39,820
I'm ready to put them in a locker.

5326
06:07:44,820 --> 06:07:45,240
Okay,

5327
06:07:49,720 --> 06:07:50,760
this is gonna take a while.

5328
06:07:50,840 --> 06:07:51,980
There's a lot of Endermen.

5329
06:08:01,870 --> 06:08:05,030
Like, I'm doing it two by... like, two by two.

5330
06:08:05,350 --> 06:08:08,110
And, like, apparently I need hundreds of Endermen.

5331
06:08:12,670 --> 06:08:15,250
I know, like, why is nobody helping me?

5332
06:08:15,470 --> 06:08:16,770
I'm just leading them.

5333
06:08:19,790 --> 06:08:21,150
Oh, is it crafting time?

5334
06:08:29,310 --> 06:08:29,990
Right?

5335
06:08:39,950 --> 06:08:42,150
Rockin' minecart!

5336
06:08:52,290 --> 06:08:53,030
Yeah!

5337
06:08:56,710 --> 06:08:57,850
We're at war!

5338
06:08:59,850 --> 06:09:01,630
We're gonna MacGyver it, yeah.

5339
06:09:01,630 --> 06:09:01,850
Yeah.

5340
06:09:05,930 --> 06:09:07,310
She'll be okay, guys.

5341
06:09:07,430 --> 06:09:08,450
She's done it before.

5342
06:09:11,250 --> 06:09:12,990
Wait, guys, I don't know how to craft this.

5343
06:09:13,090 --> 06:09:13,570
Guys, wait.

5344
06:09:17,510 --> 06:09:19,290
What if we all fly away?

5345
06:09:19,870 --> 06:09:21,630
I'm so tempted to just have...

5346
06:09:25,070 --> 06:09:25,510
Lucas!

5347
06:09:34,270 --> 06:09:35,930
Wait, how come they're okay?

5348
06:09:38,010 --> 06:09:40,090
Why don't they look as fucked up as her?

5349
06:09:44,130 --> 06:09:44,990
Look at that.

5350
06:09:45,170 --> 06:09:46,930
See, guys, I didn't fuck it up.

5351
06:09:48,630 --> 06:09:49,590
Look at that.

5352
06:09:50,970 --> 06:09:52,790
I didn't fuck it up, guys.

5353
06:09:53,270 --> 06:09:55,010
He still thinks we're friends.

5354
06:09:58,070 --> 06:09:59,150
Give us a sec.

5355
06:09:59,230 --> 06:10:00,890
We're making the rockin' minecart.

5356
06:10:01,730 --> 06:10:02,770
Sounded the coolest.

5357
06:10:05,050 --> 06:10:06,830
It's not doomed, guys!

5358
06:10:24,250 --> 06:10:25,890
Wait, Ruby, what are you doing here?

5359
06:10:33,700 --> 06:10:35,880
Ruben, you're fucking useless in here!

5360
06:10:36,920 --> 06:10:38,100
What the fuck?

5361
06:10:47,760 --> 06:10:49,420
What the fuck?

5362
06:10:50,900 --> 06:10:52,320
Is this a wither disease?

5363
06:10:52,840 --> 06:10:53,700
Oh, they are!

5364
06:10:56,560 --> 06:10:59,200
Wait, they're the wither citizens.

5365
06:10:59,580 --> 06:11:00,980
Is this what they're gonna turn into?

5366
06:11:04,890 --> 06:11:06,670
Wait, we're inside.

5367
06:11:06,890 --> 06:11:08,790
Aren't we gonna turn into wither guys?

5368
06:11:15,710 --> 06:11:17,230
Oh my god, that's the butcher!

5369
06:11:17,770 --> 06:11:17,910
Ruben!

5370
06:11:18,790 --> 06:11:19,790
You fucker!

5371
06:11:20,390 --> 06:11:20,930
Come back!

5372
06:11:21,430 --> 06:11:21,930
Come back!

5373
06:11:22,030 --> 06:11:22,510
Don't be useless!

5374
06:11:22,510 --> 06:11:22,730
Don't be useless!

5375
06:11:31,450 --> 06:11:33,170
Oh no.

5376
06:11:36,490 --> 06:11:39,550
Oh, Ruben, now you come back after I fucking fell.

5377
06:11:40,630 --> 06:11:42,130
There it is.

5378
06:11:51,270 --> 06:11:53,530
Slash despawn wither.

5379
06:11:55,230 --> 06:11:58,970
It's time to mine the command block, guys.

5380
06:11:58,970 --> 06:12:02,610
Guys, the pickaxe is actually the perfect weapon.

5381
06:12:03,010 --> 06:12:05,450
It's time to mine the command block.

5382
06:12:06,870 --> 06:12:08,470
There it is.

5383
06:12:14,450 --> 06:12:16,470
I actually chose the right weapon.

5384
06:12:17,570 --> 06:12:19,570
The right tool for the job.

5385
06:12:21,630 --> 06:12:23,050
That's right, here I go.

5386
06:12:25,590 --> 06:12:26,150
Look at that.

5387
06:12:27,590 --> 06:12:30,350
With my efficiency 5, fortune 3.

5388
06:12:32,730 --> 06:12:34,930
What the fuck is he trying to do?

5389
06:12:36,050 --> 06:12:38,670
Oh my god, I mined a tentacle.

5390
06:12:43,410 --> 06:12:46,230
You gotta hold down the button.

5391
06:12:52,930 --> 06:12:55,230
Oh my god, I almost... Okay, I gotta hold down.

5392
06:12:58,850 --> 06:12:59,950
Don't worry, I got you.

5393
06:13:00,550 --> 06:13:02,310
I feel like... Oh shit.

5394
06:13:06,470 --> 06:13:12,070
I was gonna say, I feel like I'll instant die if I fuck it up one time.

5395
06:13:13,590 --> 06:13:16,070
Oh shit, I almost pressed Q.

5396
06:13:18,210 --> 06:13:19,410
That didn't count, guys.

5397
06:13:19,510 --> 06:13:20,330
That didn't count.

5398
06:13:20,910 --> 06:13:24,610
I was like, hmm, if I press one wrong button, do I just die?

5399
06:13:25,650 --> 06:13:27,330
Now we know, now we know.

5400
06:13:29,090 --> 06:13:30,310
Now we know, guys.

5401
06:13:30,910 --> 06:13:32,270
It was educational.

5402
06:13:33,310 --> 06:13:34,910
I was trying to figure it out.

5403
06:13:38,630 --> 06:13:39,830
That's right, one more hit.

5404
06:13:54,930 --> 06:13:56,110
Just needs one more.

5405
06:13:57,790 --> 06:13:59,130
How the fuck did I get up there?

5406
06:14:01,630 --> 06:14:01,830
What?

5407
06:14:02,870 --> 06:14:04,110
Oh my god.

5408
06:14:05,330 --> 06:14:06,890
Ruben's just like, okay.

5409
06:14:13,010 --> 06:14:18,430
Hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop.

5410
06:14:18,790 --> 06:14:19,990
I'm here now.

5411
06:14:26,010 --> 06:14:28,130
Why did it not bring any blocks with me?

5412
06:14:29,590 --> 06:14:31,550
I could've just built up.

5413
06:14:32,610 --> 06:14:33,410
Oh no.

5414
06:14:34,270 --> 06:14:37,470
Why did I not bring any- Oh, what the fuck?

5415
06:14:37,610 --> 06:14:39,830
Oh, he like, inverted his head.

5416
06:14:40,990 --> 06:14:42,370
Wait, that's fucked.

5417
06:14:49,550 --> 06:14:51,210
Ruben, why can't you listen?

5418
06:14:56,630 --> 06:14:59,790
Ruben, I had one simple instruction for you.

5419
06:15:02,150 --> 06:15:03,910
Wait, I could just mine it right now.

5420
06:15:04,030 --> 06:15:06,030
Wait, you're right, I could just mine a block right now.

5421
06:15:09,430 --> 06:15:11,350
And then build up.

5422
06:15:22,530 --> 06:15:28,520
Stay out of sight, Ruben!

5423
06:15:29,460 --> 06:15:30,780
But you won't listen.

5424
06:15:45,160 --> 06:15:45,640
Oh!

5425
06:15:49,180 --> 06:15:50,620
Oh, that's smart.

5426
06:15:51,520 --> 06:15:53,760
How did I not get the Wither Sickness, though?

5427
06:15:58,480 --> 06:15:59,200
Yoink.

5428
06:16:04,890 --> 06:16:06,110
Time for the final- Oh!

5429
06:16:18,560 --> 06:16:19,280
Ruben!

5430
06:16:19,280 --> 06:16:24,640
Bring... bring... pickaxe... to daddy!

5431
06:16:25,500 --> 06:16:26,540
That's it, that's it.

5432
06:16:26,800 --> 06:16:28,340
That's right, that's right.

5433
06:16:28,340 --> 06:16:29,580
Come on, Ruben, I believe in you.

5434
06:16:29,580 --> 06:16:29,620
To me!

5435
06:16:30,140 --> 06:16:31,280
Don't- To me!

5436
06:16:33,720 --> 06:16:34,320
Ruben!

5437
06:16:34,600 --> 06:16:35,420
Yes, that's right!

5438
06:16:35,440 --> 06:16:36,380
I'll catch you!

5439
06:16:39,760 --> 06:16:40,940
Ruben, no!

5440
06:16:43,960 --> 06:16:44,960
Okay, okay.

5441
06:16:45,320 --> 06:16:46,400
Okay, I'll catch him.

5442
06:16:47,140 --> 06:16:48,820
Ruben, I'll catch you for sure!

5443
06:16:53,500 --> 06:16:56,920
No, no, no, no, no!

5444
06:16:57,480 --> 06:16:59,180
I just - I just wanted to see!

5445
06:17:00,020 --> 06:17:02,980
I just- I just wanted to see!

5446
06:17:03,340 --> 06:17:05,280
I have one redo!

5447
06:17:07,020 --> 06:17:09,900
And my intrusive thoughts won, okay, guys?

5448
06:17:10,940 --> 06:17:12,140
I couldn't help it!

5449
06:17:12,260 --> 06:17:13,820
The intrusive thoughts won!

5450
06:17:16,460 --> 06:17:17,180
I'm so sorry.

5451
06:17:17,820 --> 06:17:18,400
I'm so sorry.

5452
06:17:18,400 --> 06:17:18,500
I'm so sorry.

5453
06:17:20,500 --> 06:17:23,000
Look, it was all just- See, I caught him.

5454
06:17:23,180 --> 06:17:25,840
I did- I would never do that to you, Ruben.

5455
06:17:31,900 --> 06:17:33,200
Oh my god, Ruben!

5456
06:17:34,040 --> 06:17:35,460
Oh my god, he has his legs!

5457
06:17:36,160 --> 06:17:36,560
Quick!

5458
06:17:40,810 --> 06:17:41,270
Ruben!

5459
06:17:49,290 --> 06:17:51,950
Wait, what now?

5460
06:17:52,710 --> 06:17:55,290
I didn't know he'd actually fall!

5461
06:17:58,630 --> 06:18:00,930
He falls anyway!

5462
06:18:05,060 --> 06:18:06,200
What now?

5463
06:18:07,060 --> 06:18:08,940
I didn't know right after!

5464
06:18:09,540 --> 06:18:10,820
Oh, it's okay, there's water.

5465
06:18:10,820 --> 06:18:15,080
He definitely landed in the water, right, guys?

5466
06:18:28,670 --> 06:18:30,510
Guys, where's Ruben?

5467
06:18:34,190 --> 06:18:36,070
Guys, where's Ruben?

5468
06:18:36,150 --> 06:18:38,150
It was the funny prank!

5469
06:18:38,270 --> 06:18:39,070
It was a dream!

5470
06:18:39,850 --> 06:18:40,690
I caught him!

5471
06:18:45,550 --> 06:18:47,150
Guys, I caught him!

5472
06:18:47,150 --> 06:18:48,610
I caught him, though!

5473
06:18:56,490 --> 06:18:59,610
The only pilot that was alive!

5474
06:19:07,350 --> 06:19:08,830
Ruben, I caught you!

5475
06:19:09,010 --> 06:19:09,830
Remember, Ruben?

5476
06:19:10,550 --> 06:19:13,270
I caught you, Ruben!

5477
06:19:14,810 --> 06:19:15,650
Ruben!

5478
06:19:15,650 --> 06:19:18,870
Ruben, are you okay?

5479
06:19:20,470 --> 06:19:22,310
Guys, do you think he's okay?

5480
06:19:23,090 --> 06:19:24,670
Do you think he's okay?

5481
06:19:32,240 --> 06:19:34,520
Are you okay?

5482
06:19:35,200 --> 06:19:37,000
Get off, Ruben!

5483
06:19:37,700 --> 06:19:39,240
Ruben, I need you!

5484
06:19:39,420 --> 06:19:40,280
It was a joke!

5485
06:19:40,840 --> 06:19:42,840
It was a prank, Ruben!

5486
06:19:42,840 --> 06:19:45,000
I'm so sorry!

5487
06:19:45,160 --> 06:19:46,060
It was a prank!

5488
06:19:46,100 --> 06:19:47,060
I caught you!

5489
06:19:47,600 --> 06:19:48,540
Ruben, remember?

5490
06:19:48,740 --> 06:19:49,820
I caught you!

5491
06:19:55,220 --> 06:19:56,060
Oh

5492
06:20:08,950 --> 06:20:13,090
my god!

5493
06:20:17,090 --> 06:20:20,390
I'm so sorry!

5494
06:20:21,450 --> 06:20:22,910
Oh my god!

5495
06:20:25,730 --> 06:20:28,130
Oh my god!

5496
06:20:30,630 --> 06:20:32,710
Ruben, will you remember?

5497
06:20:33,690 --> 06:20:35,570
It was just a joke!

5498
06:20:35,630 --> 06:20:37,010
I caught you, Ruben!

5499
06:20:37,510 --> 06:20:38,690
I caught you!

5500
06:20:47,970 --> 06:20:51,450
I didn't think he'd fall!

5501
06:20:52,230 --> 06:20:56,670
I didn't think... I didn't realize that's how he dies!

5502
06:20:59,970 --> 06:21:02,570
One week later...

5503
06:21:03,870 --> 06:21:06,010
Oh my god!

5504
06:21:10,580 --> 06:21:12,640
What did I do with the pork?

5505
06:21:13,340 --> 06:21:15,340
What did I do with it?

5506
06:21:21,660 --> 06:21:25,440
The butcher was invited to his funeral?

5507
06:21:26,320 --> 06:21:27,600
That's fucked.

5508
06:21:28,100 --> 06:21:29,920
Why is he still wearing the fishbowl?

5509
06:21:29,920 --> 06:21:30,420
Who

5510
06:21:34,570 --> 06:21:39,310
invited the fucking butcher?

5511
06:21:41,130 --> 06:21:42,590
Thank you for the superchat.

5512
06:21:42,670 --> 06:21:42,990
Thank you.

5513
06:21:43,030 --> 06:21:43,590
Thank you.

5514
06:21:43,670 --> 06:21:44,730
Oh, that was a bad time.

5515
06:21:45,010 --> 06:21:47,010
He microwaved hot dogs.

5516
06:21:47,970 --> 06:21:49,890
Thank you for the superchat.

5517
06:21:50,110 --> 06:21:50,310
Thank you.

5518
06:21:50,630 --> 06:21:51,230
Thank you.

5519
06:21:51,910 --> 06:21:52,890
Wait, he lives?

5520
06:21:54,450 --> 06:21:57,230
They deserve... No, they deserve to tell them the truth.

5521
06:22:02,030 --> 06:22:04,490
We didn't give Magnus a memorial!

5522
06:22:04,490 --> 06:22:06,070
Wait, you're right!

5523
06:22:20,910 --> 06:22:22,570
Expose yourself now.

5524
06:22:23,350 --> 06:22:24,910
That pig died for this.

5525
06:22:37,830 --> 06:22:39,930
He poor will remember that.

5526
06:22:47,190 --> 06:22:47,950
Me!

5527
06:22:55,910 --> 06:22:59,290
I can't believe Magnus did not get a funeral.

5528
06:23:18,290 --> 06:23:20,990
I had Reuben!

5529
06:23:23,290 --> 06:23:25,410
Fuck you guys.

5530
06:23:25,810 --> 06:23:26,850
I had Reuben.

5531
06:23:32,930 --> 06:23:35,750
Everyone loves pigs.

5532
06:23:37,230 --> 06:23:38,630
True.

5533
06:23:41,250 --> 06:23:41,930
True.

5534
06:23:45,710 --> 06:23:48,150
The power of pigs.

5535
06:23:54,510 --> 06:23:56,630
They were there, I guess.

5536
06:23:56,890 --> 06:23:57,930
The others were there.

5537
06:23:57,930 --> 06:24:06,130
I didn't think you would fall right after!

5538
06:24:06,490 --> 06:24:07,890
Boomtown!

5539
06:24:13,750 --> 06:24:15,470
That's my highlight.

5540
06:24:31,670 --> 06:24:32,590
Yeah,

5541
06:24:36,530 --> 06:24:36,890
me!

5542
06:24:39,050 --> 06:24:40,710
That's me!

5543
06:24:42,910 --> 06:24:44,670
You know what really matters?

5544
06:24:45,470 --> 06:24:46,450
Dot dot dot.

5545
06:24:46,450 --> 06:24:47,010
I did it!

5546
06:24:58,590 --> 06:25:00,610
What am I doing in the Netherstar?

5547
06:25:04,790 --> 06:25:06,110
Jesse, that's me.

5548
06:25:07,610 --> 06:25:09,910
Thank god I played as the guy from Patton Oswalt.

5549
06:25:25,290 --> 06:25:27,010
My god, it's beautiful.

5550
06:25:38,030 --> 06:25:38,450
Jesse!

5551
06:25:40,290 --> 06:25:41,490
Oh, we're the new order?

5552
06:25:44,370 --> 06:25:46,110
Oh my god, I did it, guys.

5553
06:25:47,850 --> 06:25:51,190
Alright, so by the law of the order, the stone broke.

5554
06:25:51,190 --> 06:25:53,090
And one of us will die in the end.

5555
06:26:02,330 --> 06:26:05,310
Why is that voice actor so familiar?

5556
06:26:10,710 --> 06:26:12,870
I did it!

5557
06:26:15,510 --> 06:26:16,350
Yeah!

5558
06:26:16,690 --> 06:26:17,930
Is that Zack Brannigan?

5559
06:26:18,450 --> 06:26:20,730
Oh my god, it's Futurama!

5560
06:26:21,350 --> 06:26:22,270
That's why!

5561
06:26:23,510 --> 06:26:25,330
He sounds...

5562
06:26:26,330 --> 06:26:28,130
It's Zack Brannigan!

5563
06:26:28,630 --> 06:26:32,110
I was being narrated by fucking Zack Brannigan!

5564
06:26:33,290 --> 06:26:38,290
I was like, why do I feel like I've heard this voice before?

5565
06:26:40,890 --> 06:26:42,270
Yes, Billy West!

5566
06:26:42,450 --> 06:26:49,750
He's the guy who was Fry, the professor, Zack Brannigan, and he does a lot of other ones.

5567
06:26:49,910 --> 06:26:51,750
But these are the ones I remember off the top of my head.

5568
06:26:53,350 --> 06:26:54,570
Oh my god.

5569
06:26:55,490 --> 06:26:56,390
That was fun.

5570
06:26:57,110 --> 06:26:59,430
That was pretty fun, guys.

5571
06:26:59,530 --> 06:27:01,630
I can't believe... How long were we streaming for?

5572
06:27:01,710 --> 06:27:02,590
Holy shit.

5573
06:27:02,590 --> 06:27:07,790
We went all the way from episode 1 to 4.

5574
06:27:08,110 --> 06:27:11,290
That was crazy.

5575
06:27:11,810 --> 06:27:14,830
I can't believe we made it.

5576
06:27:14,870 --> 06:27:16,610
We did it all the way to the end.

5577
06:27:16,770 --> 06:27:17,990
But we're not gonna do the DLC.

5578
06:27:19,890 --> 06:27:25,070
We did 6 hours, finished the main story arc.

5579
06:27:25,950 --> 06:27:32,930
I had a great... I think my favorite episode has to be episode 4.

5580
06:27:33,370 --> 06:27:36,910
Episode 4 was definitely my favorite out of the 4 episodes.

5581
06:27:37,410 --> 06:27:42,870
The 4th episode was my favorite for sure.

5582
06:27:42,990 --> 06:27:49,170
I think I liked the 4th episode the most out of all the episodes.

5583
06:27:49,870 --> 06:27:55,670
I think the... which one was it?

5584
06:27:55,930 --> 06:28:04,530
The one where I did not realize that he dies right after I catch him.

5585
06:28:04,970 --> 06:28:10,230
So yeah, when I... I didn't realize it was just that part.

5586
06:28:12,990 --> 06:28:15,330
I couldn't help it.

5587
06:28:15,530 --> 06:28:18,530
My intrusive thoughts just won that day.

5588
06:28:21,810 --> 06:28:25,330
Like, he was gonna fall anyway.

5589
06:28:25,650 --> 06:28:26,770
Like, what the fuck?

5590
06:28:27,330 --> 06:28:34,130
And I think when Soren did the slash and he spawned Ender Dragon, it was pretty funny.

5591
06:28:34,270 --> 06:28:36,690
I did not expect that to actually happen.

5592
06:28:37,050 --> 06:28:42,990
I thought it was like a joke, but he actually slash despawned him.

5593
06:28:43,790 --> 06:28:45,390
But I enjoyed it a lot.

5594
06:28:45,390 --> 06:28:55,070
I definitely enjoyed playing the Minecraft Story Telltale game, Story Mode.

5595
06:28:55,510 --> 06:28:56,910
Zekra, thank you for the superchat.

5596
06:28:57,010 --> 06:28:57,630
Thank you, thank you.

5597
06:28:57,730 --> 06:28:59,470
Pour one out for Ruben.

5598
06:28:59,550 --> 06:29:00,790
We lost a good one.

5599
06:29:01,150 --> 06:29:01,930
Thank you for the superchat.

5600
06:29:02,030 --> 06:29:02,730
Thank you, thank you.

5601
06:29:03,050 --> 06:29:06,950
I hope you guys had a fun time watching the entire stream.

5602
06:29:07,290 --> 06:29:19,270
I mean, for those who stuck it up from the very beginning, from when it started to now, like, congratulations to you guys, because it's also really, really, like, for some of you guys, especially the East Coast viewers.

5603
06:29:19,510 --> 06:29:22,970
But yeah, thank you all for sticking it out for six plus hours today.

5604
06:29:23,530 --> 06:29:24,630
Dan, thank you for the superchat.

5605
06:29:24,730 --> 06:29:25,550
Thank you, thank you.

5606
06:29:25,750 --> 06:29:28,730
Yeah, it was a wild ride.

5607
06:29:29,030 --> 06:29:33,830
I guess we'll never know what the handshake is like, because I fucked up.

5608
06:29:34,070 --> 06:29:40,590
I legitimately didn't even see... I didn't even see the QuickTime event.

5609
06:29:40,590 --> 06:29:43,670
It happened so fast, it didn't show up.

5610
06:29:43,970 --> 06:29:49,830
Like, my eyes didn't... I was not, like, comprehending that there was a QuickTime event there.

5611
06:29:49,990 --> 06:29:51,690
I was just like, that's it.

5612
06:29:55,530 --> 06:29:57,050
But thank you everybody for watching.

5613
06:29:57,190 --> 06:29:58,250
Thank you for all the raids.

5614
06:29:58,370 --> 06:30:00,870
Thank you for all the superchats and everything.

5615
06:30:01,470 --> 06:30:06,910
I guess, like, before I go, I usually would do an after stream chat, but...

5616
06:30:08,390 --> 06:30:11,330
But I did stream for six plus hours, so I'm going to rest now.

5617
06:30:11,650 --> 06:30:14,870
Anyway, guys, for those who don't know, my YouTube plush has one week left.

5618
06:30:15,050 --> 06:30:20,110
So please, if you want to get any of my plushies from YouTubes, they end in a week.

5619
06:30:20,290 --> 06:30:25,390
And it's the last... After their preorder is done, you won't be able to get them anymore.

5620
06:30:25,550 --> 06:30:29,150
So if you really, really want these plushies, this is, like, the perfect time to get them.

5621
06:30:29,190 --> 06:30:34,950
Or they'll be gone forever, or you have to find them at really, really expensive prices on eBay or something.

5622
06:30:34,950 --> 06:30:35,410
I don't know.

5623
06:30:35,750 --> 06:30:36,630
I don't know.

5624
06:30:37,630 --> 06:30:41,910
Or maybe just wait until I fall off, and then maybe it'll be cheaper.

5625
06:30:44,290 --> 06:30:47,090
Anyway, guys, thank you all for watching.

5626
06:30:47,570 --> 06:30:54,310
As always, everybody, stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

5627
06:30:54,450 --> 06:30:59,170
And if you, except for me, head to bed, cause you deserve it.

5628
06:30:59,250 --> 06:31:00,790
Thank you everybody for watching.

5629
06:31:01,490 --> 06:31:03,230
Thank you all for always supporting me.

5630
06:31:03,230 --> 06:31:04,550
I'm gonna head off now.

5631
06:31:04,690 --> 06:31:05,450
See you everybody.

5632
06:31:05,790 --> 06:31:06,330
Bye bye!
