00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,140
Hello, it's not over yet.

2
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:42,840
That's right.

3
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,000
That's right.

4
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,220
We're back.

5
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,880
Just on Twitch now.

6
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,040
It's never over.

7
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,200
You're here forever.

8
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:00,340
Thank you everybody for all the Twitch Prime, the resubs, the bitties, the raids.

9
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,620
Oh yeah, sorry.

10
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,480
Let me make sure you guys get what you actually want.

11
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,300
But yeah, sorry, we can't be freaks right now.

12
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:08,880
We're on Twitch.

13
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:17,920
Guys, I have to take the fish and the... I have to take the kitty and the fish away.

14
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,180
Guys, we can't be freaks right now.

15
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,320
We're on Twitch at the moment, guys.

16
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,380
We're on Twitch.

17
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:23,980
We got it.

18
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,820
We had our freak session on YouTube.

19
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,460
Now we chill a little bit, guys.

20
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,180
We chill here.

21
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:38,420
We got... We got to chill a little bit now, guys.

22
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:39,560
No.

23
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,680
Embrace the cringe.

24
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,120
We're just... It's just for a little bit, guys.

25
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:51,600
It's just... We're just... We're just gonna be chill for a little bit, okay, guys?

26
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:56,020
Just... Just... Just don't freak it.

27
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,600
Don't...

28
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,560
The world must know my Ochi is a freak.

29
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,700
What's the point?

30
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,540
Wait...

31
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,540
Embrace it.

32
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:11,440
Doki.

33
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,240
Embrace the freak.

34
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,960
All right.

35
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:23,560
I am ready to queue whenever... Wait, why did... Why did he change this bad?

36
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,180
All right.

37
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,060
I'm our... All right.

38
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:29,720
It's time.

39
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,040
Chat, don't be ashamed of what you are.

40
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:34,720
What do you mean?

41
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,900
It says Doki Bird.

42
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,620
What do you mean?

43
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,880
I'm... I'm Doki Bird.

44
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,700
I don't know what you're talking about.

45
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:54,510
What do you mean, guys?

46
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,090
I deem a Doki Bird.

47
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:56,750
Okay.

48
00:05:58,570 --> 00:05:59,210
Okay.

49
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:04,410
You know... You know what happens when you demand something from me.

50
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:05,230
Yeah.

51
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:10,990
You know what happens when you try to demand something.

52
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,910
Now, because you demanded...

53
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:16,070
And Doki Bird Deem.

54
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,590
The monkey pot.

55
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:21,010
Doki Bird.

56
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:25,950
Doki Bird.inois

57
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:31,450
it says.

58
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:31,870
Let's see.

59
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,960
Alright.

60
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,500
Doki Bird junto.

61
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,420
And the Monkeys Pop Carl's Doki Bird.

62
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:47,240
This one will never appear unless this is redeemed.

63
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,300
There we go.

64
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,900
Someone, quick!

65
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,260
Redeem it!

66
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,000
I'm gonna get water, guys.

67
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,640
So you can sit.

68
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:03,560
Remember...

69
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,800
Who said that, by the way?

70
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,080
Guess what Dragoon did this to you?

71
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:16,180
Which Dragoon did this to you, guys?

72
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,060
Which one was it?

73
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,260
Oh, Del-Delta.

74
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,540
Remember who said this?

75
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,600
It was Del-Delta.

76
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,940
Naoto Kitty will never appear.

77
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,280
This also means on YouTube, too.

78
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,310
That's right.

79
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,310
Alright.

80
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,210
Did you guys sit in?

81
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:53,010
No!

82
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:54,330
Mods!

83
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:54,690
No!

84
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,890
It did not ask!

85
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,850
You monster!

86
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,130
Alright.

87
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:05,710
Alright.

88
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:05,970
Alright.

89
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:06,330
Alright.

90
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,370
What about...

91
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:11,150
We got...

92
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,170
Alright.

93
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,050
So, Drago Kitty will never appear on Twitch again.

94
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:16,580
Until...

95
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,220
I...

96
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,650
No Kitty...

97
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:24,050
Do here.

98
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,630
We will never appear on Twitch again.

99
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,270
Until this is redeemed.

100
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:31,610
No no no no no!

101
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,370
No no no no!

102
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:34,630
I...

103
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,250
I have been...

104
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,530
So reasonable.

105
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:38,330
And such...

106
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,670
I have been so reasonable.

107
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:43,430
And such a generous person!

108
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:52,570
I have given people Doe Kitty out of the goodness of my own free will, of my kind of heart.

109
00:08:52,790 --> 00:09:03,490
And yet, this Dragoon, who represents all of you, made the demand to put Doe Kitty as a redeemed.

110
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:08,910
And out of the goodness of my own heart, I did it for all of you.

111
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,130
Shirley!

112
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,970
He is a Dragoon, right?

113
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,310
And he represents all of you!

114
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:26,730
You do claim him as a Dragoon, right?

115
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,330
What happened to, like...

116
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,530
Dragoons stick together?

117
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,430
Not anymore!

118
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:39,230
You don't need to do this kind gesture.

119
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:40,830
I don't understand!

120
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,130
Was this not what you wanted?

121
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:51,350
Instead of me randomly bringing out Doe Kitty when I feel like it, you guys wanted to choose when Doe Kitty comes out?

122
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:58,450
And because I'm letting you choose, I decided to do what you wanted me to do!

123
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,430
Make a redeemed!

124
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:02,650
Is that not what you requested?

125
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:09,650
Did you not request that?

126
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:15,670
What did Delta say?

127
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:19,050
What are his words for it?

128
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:20,170
Is he hiding?

129
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:20,850
Is he hiding?

130
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,450
Now that he's fucked over all of you?

131
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:27,790
Is he hiding from the mob?

132
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,930
Now that he has fucked over all of you?

133
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,030
Is that what he's doing?

134
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:38,070
I'm not the type who fades quietly into the background.

135
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,590
Alright, so we have triple res.

136
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,310
So I guess what we do...

137
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:44,910
I guess we put Cal on...

138
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,390
We put Cal on take!

139
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,730
Okay, this is interesting.

140
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,030
Cal, if you wanna add him, I

141
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,040
can...

142
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,520
Dusty Cal...

143
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,960
One million for his head!

144
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,740
Bro, creeped us and dipped!

145
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,320
Crazy shit!

146
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:15,440
Bro, I haven't freeze-camped in like a month, bro.

147
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,100
Wait, we have no tanks, guys!

148
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,860
Wait, shit, I wanna see that.

149
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,460
You can't see me, I'm not gonna lie.

150
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,980
You can tune in right now, you wouldn't see me, the map is too dark.

151
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,800
Alright, hell yeah.

152
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,100
Bro, what?

153
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,480
I'm not kidding.

154
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,960
You can go look right now, you'll be...

155
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,680
I can't...

156
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,860
Alright, I'm trying new settings that's exclusively for Twitch.

157
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,060
I don't know if it's a lot better.

158
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,480
I can't see you.

159
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,460
Is this new here?

160
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,860
Somewhere like...

161
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:47,700
I think it was a great opportunity.

162
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,100
I'm very thankful to have that opportunity.

163
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,340
I don't think I've ever...

164
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,400
Would ever have a chance like that ever again.

165
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,440
So, yeah!

166
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,240
I'm res.

167
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,900
I'm super excited about it.

168
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,240
Oh my god.

169
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,480
That was scary.

170
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,200
That was very scary.

171
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:11,500
Whoa!

172
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:34,570
I'm gonna put this on our side lock.

173
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,790
I feel like he deserves it more.

174
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:40,170
Whoa!

175
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:44,670
Whoa!

176
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,550
It's an atom right here.

177
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:46,090
I'm scared.

178
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:50,930
Whoa!

179
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:52,270
I'm dead.

180
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,450
I did not expect that.

181
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,850
I don't know if I should...

182
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:05,590
Hmm.

183
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:07,650
Can I do it for our...

184
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:09,390
I guess I should do it for our side...

185
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,730
I'm trying to figure out if I want...

186
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:13,750
If I do it for side lock or...

187
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:14,850
Star Lord.

188
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:17,930
Really?

189
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:19,850
Oh man, just...

190
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:21,130
Make sure we touch.

191
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:24,750
Make sure we touch.

192
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:25,510
Oh, I'll...

193
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,330
Oh wait, oh wait, never mind.

194
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:28,670
Never mind, you get it first.

195
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,590
Come on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on.

196
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,910
I am ready to put on a show!

197
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:36,050
Um, click small...

198
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:36,570
Call?

199
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:43,110
For some reason, I thought I had a hundred.

200
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:44,130
But I was looking at...

201
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:47,750
Alright.

202
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,170
Okay, it's five.

203
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:51,150
Whoa!

204
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:51,990
Item one, item one.

205
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:54,450
Just me?

206
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:57,430
Oh, nice.

207
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:59,670
Did that guy just try to run this?

208
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:00,450
Yeah.

209
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:03,130
Oh!

210
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:04,170
It's a cap.

211
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,490
I swear I heard...

212
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:10,510
I heard a side lock.

213
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:11,670
I'm taking this one.

214
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,310
That's right, you're right, guys.

215
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:17,690
Now that I'm on Twitch, the curse only exists on YouTube.

216
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:19,130
You're so right.

217
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:27,410
Alright.

218
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:28,770
Oh!

219
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,770
Why is he okay?

220
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:35,710
You're okay.

221
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:36,970
You're okay.

222
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:37,390
You're so healthy.

223
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:39,390
I can build you whenever.

224
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,970
Don't worry, he's so healthy still.

225
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,010
I apologize, I should say.

226
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:48,890
I'll keep it myself.

227
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,650
Oh no, we don't have...

228
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:54,130
I'm a little scared.

229
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,070
I'm a little scared.

230
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:02,250
I can get you.

231
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,070
I can get you.

232
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,230
I can get you.

233
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,610
I can get you.

234
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:09,370
Oh.

235
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:11,070
That is...

236
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:14,090
Oh my god, please!

237
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,650
I guess I'll die.

238
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,410
I got grabbed.

239
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:27,350
I'm trying to stop them.

240
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:28,190
That's right.

241
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:30,830
You can't do it because I blocked that message.

242
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:31,630
I...

243
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:37,690
That message is blocked.

244
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,010
On Twitch.

245
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:41,970
I have self-moderation.

246
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,470
And I made shit.

247
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,260
Oh my god.

248
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:54,520
I swear if that hit me, I swear to God.

249
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:08,870
Oh my god.

250
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:09,090
Oh my god.

251
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:09,490
Okay, it's fine.

252
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:09,870
It's fine.

253
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:12,190
Everything is fine.

254
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:13,550
Everything is fine.

255
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,730
Everything is so fine.

256
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,470
Everything... I will not get logged.

257
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:18,570
I will not get logged.

258
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:23,730
Oh my god.

259
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:24,330
Oh my god.

260
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:25,030
He looked at me.

261
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,570
He actually looked at me.

262
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:43,550
I wanted to save him, but it's too late.

263
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,330
It's too late.

264
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,570
I couldn't save him.

265
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,690
I couldn't save him.

266
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,590
He was so far.

267
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,520
Oh, that's not good.

268
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,420
That's not good.

269
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,420
Oh, that's still not good.

270
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:09,920
Whoa!

271
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,000
Should be.

272
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:25,880
Whoa!

273
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,480
Okay.

274
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:31,600
You actually should be okay, but I guess not.

275
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,260
Can we touch?

276
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,870
This is real!

277
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,100
Oh, my God.

278
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:54,560
Oh, my God.

279
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:54,720
Oh, my God.

280
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,180
I'm walking back on somebody's car.

281
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:01,460
Please.

282
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:06,960
No!

283
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:19,250
That's a lucky course of me up.

284
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:33,430
Do you play, like, tank at all or no?

285
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:34,970
My life energy flows stronger.

286
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:35,230
That was pretty cool.

287
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:36,730
Cal was pretty good at Phylocke.

288
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:38,570
Emon?

289
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:40,130
Be strong together.

290
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,570
That sucks, isn't it?

291
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:43,930
That's right, I was fucking myself.

292
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,250
Only 60 seconds left.

293
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:50,790
I don't want Mantis first.

294
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:52,650
Can you walk in with Mantis?

295
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:53,850
Yeah, I'm gonna touch her.

296
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:54,730
Yeah, I'm gonna touch her.

297
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:56,330
I am ready to put on a show.

298
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,110
Oh, my God.

299
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,490
I like how he's like, guess how fuck was.

300
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:02,230
So...

301
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:03,310
I like the bomb in my best time.

302
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:05,110
I got you.

303
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:05,890
I got you.

304
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:06,410
I'm sleeping, sleeping.

305
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:09,710
Yeah, one of three, one of three.

306
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:10,310
Rush.

307
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:10,810
Alright.

308
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:13,190
No curses here!

309
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:14,390
Both on, both on.

310
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:14,850
We're okay.

311
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:15,310
We're okay.

312
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:15,570
We're okay.

313
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:15,970
We're okay.

314
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:16,330
We're okay.

315
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:31,770
We're okay.

316
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:32,090
Lucky.

317
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:39,360
I'm gonna save my ult into the Hawk Owl.

318
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,980
That's unlucky.

319
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,560
Uh...

320
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:47,920
Alright.

321
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:51,900
Oh.

322
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:58,360
All I'm saying is that we have missed a lot of these shots.

323
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:03,470
Oh.

324
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:04,770
Oh.

325
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,150
Oh.

326
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:08,630
Oh, my God.

327
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:09,970
That's like...

328
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:11,870
a continuous res into death.

329
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:14,690
Oh.

330
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:17,650
Wait, he didn't even try and touch.

331
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,470
The current score is...

332
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:20,450
Zero.

333
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:21,370
Two.

334
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:22,230
Three.

335
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,050
Time to switch things up.

336
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:25,870
Including...

337
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:28,490
Don't make me add curse of Nya too!

338
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:33,390
I am Loki, god of mystery.

339
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:34,290
Whoa!

340
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:36,610
Damn!

341
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:42,850
This guy is like...

342
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,190
This guy...

343
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:47,810
Is actually...

344
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:57,770
This guy is a little special!

345
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,550
I'm just gonna go Loki then.

346
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,190
Who is this?

347
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,150
Who is this guy?

348
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,900
How strange.

349
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,860
What the fuck is going on?

350
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:31,650
Yippee!

351
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:42,230
That's crazy!

352
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:46,730
How could he be like...

353
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:47,070
That bad?

354
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:49,470
To be honest bro, did I do something to you in the past life, bro?

355
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:57,510
I don't think he's okay.

356
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:04,170
Guys, I don't think he's okay.

357
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:06,530
I don't think Cal's okay right now.

358
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:07,530
That's really good.

359
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,010
Oh my god.

360
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:25,650
I'm getting kicked on cart.

361
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:27,070
Oh no.

362
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:35,190
Where is our, like, Zyla?

363
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,710
Anyway, I...

364
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:38,790
Wait.

365
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:40,310
Wait.

366
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:42,290
Why did he try to...

367
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:44,510
Why did he try to save him?

368
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,030
Like, I don't understand.

369
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:56,830
I would never try to save a feeding Psylocke, that's for sure.

370
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:58,270
That's why I'm curious.

371
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:02,790
Also, like, you know, when the enemy team...

372
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:08,190
Like, you know, talk shit about you, why would you continue to throw?

373
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:09,050
Like...

374
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:13,350
Like, that's what I don't understand about it.

375
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:18,090
You know, like, if you're, like, throwing on my team...

376
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:22,930
And then the enemy team is talking shit about you and, like, laughing about it...

377
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:24,850
Why would you keep throwing?

378
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:28,230
Why would you, like, be tilted?

379
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,170
Like, after that?

380
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,890
I don't understand people like that.

381
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:37,270
No teammate left behind.

382
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:41,290
I got you, bro.

383
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:41,810
It's alright.

384
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,670
Even though you hate me, how's this show love?

385
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:54,650
I got distracted there.

386
00:23:58,210 --> 00:23:59,610
That sucks.

387
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:03,390
Oh my god, he's so low.

388
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,620
Oh my god.

389
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:12,880
That sucks.

390
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:15,760
Aah...

391
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:15,900
Aw...

392
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,230
Oh my god...

393
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,190
Oh my god, I got it.

394
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:27,070
No!

395
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:27,510
No!

396
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:28,510
No!

397
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:31,090
No!

398
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:42,860
No, I've just... I just really, really love... Model Vibas.

399
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,920
The Mantis ult shit on top of it is so good, bro.

400
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,360
I don't know how we live for so long.

401
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,360
Hey, cut the Hawkeye.

402
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:55,640
Snap!

403
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,620
That's not gonna be a bad... I'm not gonna regret doing that later.

404
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,920
I've lost a damn mark.

405
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,460
He's healing so awkward.

406
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,740
Fucked me sore.

407
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,380
Wait, why did I...

408
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,440
I'm not gonna regret... Oh, yeah, see?

409
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:16,900
Alright.

410
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,560
Okay, now he's on Widow.

411
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:24,000
Deadass, that whole fucking defense is just me getting one shot by Psylocke, like, four fights in a row.

412
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,340
Unlucky.

413
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,260
I hear someone next to me.

414
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,800
Alright, maybe I'll be the one that gets one shot by Psylocke soon.

415
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,900
Come find out soon.

416
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,600
Find out soon.

417
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:35,720
Find out soon.

418
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,040
Will it be my turn?

419
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,340
Wait, they're on... Captain America now.

420
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,760
Sleeping, sleeping.

421
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:49,800
Nice.

422
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,740
Good shot, bro.

423
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,820
Wait, I think...

424
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,700
I think BlessPM talked and now he's actually trying.

425
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,140
Oh, he fucked up.

426
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,260
He fucked up!

427
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,240
He fucked up!

428
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:01,600
Oh my god.

429
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,140
He fucked up!

430
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,160
He actually...

431
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:20,960
I'm throwing.

432
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:21,420
I'm throwing.

433
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:22,880
I'm throwing.

434
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:25,620
I...

435
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,660
There's like...

436
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,160
Okay.

437
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,480
I'm...

438
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,320
I'm trying to figure out...

439
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,160
There was like...

440
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,220
This cool...

441
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:31,980
Low key tech.

442
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,100
And then...

443
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:33,580
Okay.

444
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,400
It's like...

445
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,520
It's like somewhere here.

446
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,140
And I was like...

447
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:37,940
Oh, it's here.

448
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:38,380
I see it.

449
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:38,960
Do you see it?

450
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:39,700
Do you see it?

451
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,320
It's right there.

452
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,760
It's right there.

453
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,320
I'm happy to call.

454
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,360
It's like a god spot.

455
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:46,740
More...

456
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,220
It was...

457
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:51,940
Did you see it?

458
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:52,500
Do you see it?

459
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,640
It was right there.

460
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,740
What the f...

461
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,500
Against what would be...

462
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,780
Worse then infinite.

463
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,200
What happened to the love?

464
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,900
This is mind-boggling.

465
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:13,740
Why are we all so angry?

466
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,040
Oh my god.

467
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:24,230
I'm gonna execute 7.62 with a gun from Doom.

468
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:25,110
Peace.

469
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:26,770
Peace and love, y'all.

470
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:33,510
I mean, I was ready to trade, but, you know, I figured you'd get a little angry.

471
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:35,790
We'll be coming in 30 seconds.

472
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:36,750
Stay strong.

473
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:38,030
Damn.

474
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:40,530
One time I try to steal out of Kurova, he gets angry.

475
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:42,630
You are not as human as you should.

476
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:45,670
I'm ready to get the whole family!

477
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:46,170
God!

478
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:48,070
Holy fuck!

479
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:51,210
What happened to peace and love, everyone?

480
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:53,170
Peace and love!

481
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:57,110
Jesus Christ.

482
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:02,110
That's a waste, but I wanted to use that.

483
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,030
That's so weird.

484
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,510
And now we're so goofy.

485
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:08,050
The email has...

486
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:09,210
The big head email.

487
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:11,310
We're so goofy.

488
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:15,950
Yeah, I don't think... I think, like, chit-talking are...

489
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:17,850
Are you kidding, bro?

490
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:18,990
Oh my god.

491
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:25,810
It worked.

492
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:29,810
I have to be on low ground now.

493
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:34,870
Oh my god.

494
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:37,730
I have to be on high... I get to be on low ground now because of it.

495
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:37,870
Wow, he's gone.

496
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:40,250
Badly or what?

497
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:41,730
Very badly.

498
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:43,990
I might...

499
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:44,730
Fucking motherfucker.

500
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:46,210
I hope you did that.

501
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:46,690
I'm not.

502
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:47,650
Okay.

503
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:48,690
He's alright, bro.

504
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,110
I'm coming in.

505
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:53,550
Oh my god, what's going on over there?

506
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:54,130
One.

507
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:55,510
He's stopping in their tracks!

508
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:56,990
The final ten seconds!

509
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:01,870
What the fuck is going on?

510
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,150
He's missing everything!

511
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:08,250
We are- our mantis is doing a 1v1 right now.

512
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,770
I'm ready to put on a show.

513
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:10,010
I'm ready to put on a show!

514
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:10,710
I'm not bad, come throwing.

515
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:13,980
Yeahh.

516
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:21,370
Okay.

517
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,250
When you get that one, you're winning that one.

518
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:29,910
He's scared, bro.

519
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:31,610
When you win that though.

520
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:32,250
Okay, nice.

521
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:36,310
No...

522
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:38,330
Oh shit!

523
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:39,410
Oh shit!

524
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:42,350
Okay, sorry.

525
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:49,190
I just... Did you see that?

526
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:54,650
He like... He like fucking went in the corner and turned around.

527
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:56,610
He's like... I'm ready.

528
00:29:57,610 --> 00:30:04,650
I'm... He's like... He's like... He's like... You want me to... You want me to close my eyes?

529
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:10,730
The fucking gangbang in the... In the corner.

530
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:14,470
What the fuck?

531
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:16,270
Yeah, that was hella aura.

532
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:17,470
I'm not gonna lie.

533
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:18,930
Yeah.

534
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:23,880
Pull up.

535
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,500
You got shit.

536
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,920
What is going on?

537
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,340
What the fuck is going on?

538
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,280
Oh, it's midnight.

539
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,320
I'm at those hours now.

540
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,040
It's midnight.

541
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,460
These are the hours.

542
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,060
I'm playing Loki.

543
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,140
I play all supports.

544
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,020
Depends on like what we need for the meta.

545
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,840
I play all supports.

546
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,640
Except for Jeff.

547
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:57,940
And Rocket.

548
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,980
I have never played Rocket in my life.

549
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,540
I say naturally.

550
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,680
You finally have a chance, thanks to what we're doing.

551
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,720
Which is exactly... These are Twitch hours now.

552
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,780
I'm a meta slave.

553
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:20,140
I never played any Rocket on stream ever before in my life.

554
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:29,900
I want to use that and then like... There you go.

555
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:36,660
I did not want to use that, but... I am a good person who's raised for my team.

556
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,580
How many minutes do we have?

557
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,220
We have three minutes.

558
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,160
Oh, what the fuck?

559
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:51,810
We already... What the fuck?

560
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:53,730
Oh my god.

561
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:54,570
I need to reload.

562
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:55,350
Oh my god.

563
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:56,070
Oh my god.

564
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:56,890
He lives.

565
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:58,230
He actually lives.

00:31:58,730 --> 00:31:59,710

567
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:05,270

573
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:12,230
I'm gone.

574
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:12,710
You rolled the split.

575
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:14,450

I did not expect us to win that guys.

600
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:09,170
That was... that was a special game right there.

601
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:18,110
Okay, the sniper pacifist.

602
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:21,870
Do I avoid infinite?

603
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:25,350

604
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,510

I was like, do I avoid him?

610
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:44,010
And then he like re-queues us.

611
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,220
Alright, guys.

612
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,100
Truly, uh... we... this is...

613
00:33:55,100 --> 00:34:04,960
Okay, so like you guys can sort of tell the difference between like midnight DJing queues and then like from DJing queues to like actual...

614
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,920
to like... to like...

615
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,140
to like... queues where people are all playing.

616
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:13,560
Yeah, that's... that's the difference between the two.

617
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,480
Um, and they're like both high elo too.

618
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:26,320
So yeah, these are... these are the different types of matches you get from the degenerates and the non-degenerates.

619
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:35,870
Yeah, we had like bros being bros.

620
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:38,650
Bros being bros.

621
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:39,910
Homies being homies.

622
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:41,790
And then now everyone's just...

623
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:43,290
Oh, we didn't even ban a second.

624
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:44,050
How did we win?

625
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:46,150
Everything was like against us.

626
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:47,850
We didn't even ban a second person.

627
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:48,910
We...

628
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:58,210
Everything was stacked against us and we still won?

629
00:34:58,210 --> 00:34:58,330
What?

630
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:06,270
These are not human queues.

631
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:11,490
The people playing at these hours are not real people.

632
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:12,370
Including me.

633
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:14,130
I'm not even real.

634
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:20,830
The fact that they surrendered the moment it hit...

635
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:24,590
They surrendered the moment it hit like...

636
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:27,390
What's this one?

637
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:33,680
I don't know who this person is.

638
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:37,700
Oh!

639
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,100
They play...

640
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:39,620
They scrim.

641
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,100
Not real.

642
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:43,960
Birds aren't real.

643
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:44,820
They're not.

644
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:48,880
They're meant by the government to spy on you.

645
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:57,950
That's why I'm here.

646
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:01,610
I'm just here to take your data.

647
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:03,950
Take your...

648
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:07,590
You know, it's like when they're like, remember...

649
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:08,650
Oh.

650
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:09,770
Right.

651
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:10,110
Right...

652
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:10,470
Oh.

653
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:13,630
Right now.

654
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:20,210
He's in game.

655
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:21,250
Oh!

656
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:23,450
Whenever.

657
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:28,480
You know on websites?

658
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,600
You know on websites where they're like, can you...

659
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,900
Will you accept cookies?

660
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,660
And then you click yes not knowing what exactly they are?

661
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,020
That's me.

662
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:37,420
That's me.

663
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,400
But instead of saying yes.

664
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:41,520
By watching the stream, you consent to giving me your data.

665
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,100
Why else would like...

666
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:44,780
You know like on...

667
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,680
You know like websites will have like analytics of like...

668
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,500
The information you have?

669
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,560
How else do you think like...

670
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,500
AI learns?

671
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,680
Who does...

672
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,240
Exactly.

673
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,180
Who likes...

674
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,140
Who doesn't like cookies?

675
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:02,840
No, no, no.

676
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,580
Always say yes to cookies, guys.

677
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,540
Always say yes.

678
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,120
It's really fun too.

679
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:18,890
Cookies are fun.

680
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:19,730
They're delicious.

681
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:22,530
And they help your government.

682
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:29,850
Mmm, the chocolate chip cookies.

683
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:30,810
Yum, yum.

684
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:36,710
Think about it.

685
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:43,650
If cookies in real life are delicious, that means cookies on the internet feels just the same.

686
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:48,970
You're right, guys.

687
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,130
Guys, who are we fooling?

688
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,710
Google already has all our data.

689
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:53,990
What's one more website?

690
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:54,570
You know?

691
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:55,870
What's one...

692
00:37:58,770 --> 00:37:59,290
Google...

693
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:00,190
Google...

694
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:02,930
Google and Apple already has all of them.

695
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:03,730
So like...

696
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:05,470
What's the difference with one more?

697
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:16,970
Also...

698
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:18,890

Thank you, thanks.

701
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:22,070
Oh yeah, don't forget Amazon.

702
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:25,510
You guys would be like...

703
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:26,990
I can live without Amazon.

704
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:27,970
Amazon.

705
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:29,230

706
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:32,010

707
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:33,670

710
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,100
Wait, I should laugh if you actually don't.

711
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,280
Okay, I have Amazon.

712
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:51,560
Alright, anyway.

Guys, you failed it!

723
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,970
You were supposed to give me the perfect segway...

724
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,520
To get through Twitch Prime!

725
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,020
Anyway...

726
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:15,120

Okay.

736
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,480
Oh shit, sorry.

Why did...

743
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,700
Why did no one else ban?

744
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,540
Why did no one else ban?

745
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,120
I didn't even see him!

746
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,300

747
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,440
I was like, no one else is banning!

748
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:56,380

00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:06,170
Oh my god!

Oh my god...

753
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:13,030
I'm not judging.

754
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:17,990
No one else...

755
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:19,010
No one else...

756
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:20,630
No one else did the ban!

757
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:25,090
Someone else could have stopped me!

758
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:29,030
Anyway...

759
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:29,750
So anyway...

760
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:30,870
You guys would be saying...

761
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:31,650
You guys would say...

762
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:32,730
Wow, Doki...

763
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:36,510
I have Amazon Prime!

764
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:37,850
And there would be a lot of people that would say...

765
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:38,570
I have Amazon Prime!

766
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:39,170
And I'm like...

767
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:39,630
Yeah, I do!

768
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:42,010
And then I would be like...

769
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:44,430
I'd be like...

770
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:45,170
Wow, guys!

771
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:46,350
Did you know?

772
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:48,750
If you have Amazon Prime...

773
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:50,470
You can Twitch Prime...

774
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:51,970

775
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:54,130

776
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:55,090

00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:03,850
Yes!

781
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:05,450
Every month, guys!

782
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:08,110
Anyway...

783
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:08,690
Um...

784
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:09,070
Gentle!

785
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:10,210
There you go!

786
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:11,450
Uh...

787
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:11,670
Good!

788
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:13,030
Rivet!

789
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:13,690
And Chap!

790
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:15,130
Thank you for the Twitch Prime!

791
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:15,750
See?

792
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:18,110
Look how easy that was!

793
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:21,590
Jokey!

794
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:23,050
Take a tier one something!

795
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:24,130
Yeah!

796
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:25,190
For free!

797
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:26,910
I might have fucked over my team!

798
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:28,050
But like...

799
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:28,510
It's okay!

800
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:30,110
That was...

801
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:31,510
An oopsie on my part!

802
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:48,090
That was...

803
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:49,510
I was panicking when I was banning!

804
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:52,290
Because I saw no one else was doing...

805
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:56,750
Gonna use that for myself!

806
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:05,370
Jesus Christ!

807
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:07,530
I'm...

808
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:08,390
Like...

809
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:09,610
Trying so hard!

810
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:13,550
I'm...

811
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:15,390
There's so many people to heal right now!

812
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:17,850
Jesus Christ!

813
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:21,230
Oh my god!

814
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:25,950
Oh...

815
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:26,250
Oh...

816
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:27,390
Oh...

817
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:27,750
Not nice!

818
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:32,850
Not nice!

819
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:40,960
Oh my god!

820
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,480
Jesus Christ!

821
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:47,880
Oh...

822
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,520
Thank god I banned Psylocke!

823
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,600
Bless was on the enemy team!

824
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:51,260
Thank god!

825
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:54,640
It was good!

826
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:55,040
It was good!

827
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,040
It was actually good that we did!

828
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,120
Because...

829
00:42:59,120 --> 00:42:59,780
Uh...

830
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:01,060
Uh...

831
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:03,140
Bless this Psylocke is scarier!

832
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:06,580
Oh!

833
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:07,380
Sup Sharky!

834
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:09,120
Thank you for the 5 gifted subs!

835
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:09,420
Thank you!

836
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:09,900
Thank you!

837
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:10,200
Cody!

838
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,420
Thank you for the Twitch Prime!

839
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:12,580
Thank you!

840
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:13,360
Thank you!

841
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:14,840
Really appreciate it!

842
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:19,240
It's okay!

843
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:19,840
I'm MVP!

844
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:22,260
It's okay!

845
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:22,580
It's not okay!

846
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,500
But like...

847
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:24,560
Because I'm MVP!

848
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:29,160
That means there's a bigger issue at hand!

849
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:35,330
The fact that I am MVP...

850
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:38,350
Means there's something we have to be worried about!

851
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:46,530
Oh my god!

852
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:47,810
Oh my god!

853
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:53,120
Jesus Christ!

854
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,400
I pocketed him so hard too!

855
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,440
That's crazy!

856
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:02,240
He got pocketed so...

857
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,340
It's hard for that!

858
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:05,000
Like he had orb!

859
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,600
He had orb!

860
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,940
He had like...

861
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:10,340
Fucking me healing him while he had orb!

862
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:12,380
Like what more can I do!

863
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,520
He was dead man walking!

864
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:23,450
Oh!

865
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:24,830
Yul first!

866
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:28,390
Oh!

867
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:29,930
Okay!

868
00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:33,110
I should have...

869
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:35,270
Oh my god!

870
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:37,490
He fucking bursted me?!

871
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:41,110
Okay, I thought I could live longer!

872
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:42,070
That was my bad!

873
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:44,490
I went from 0 to 100!

874
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:46,010
That's actually crazy!

875
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:48,170
I went from 0 to...

876
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:51,410
Like 100 to 0!

877
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:52,430
So fast!

878
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:01,630
Like I did not expect to lose...

879
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:02,790
I...

880
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:04,450
I saw the rocket all!

881
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:05,310
So I was like...

882
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:07,510
That's enough time for me to be alive!

883
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:09,990
That was a lie!

884
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:13,810
That was a lie!

885
00:45:14,090 --> 00:45:14,230
That was a lie!

886
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:14,990
That was a lie!

887
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:15,410
That was absolutely a lie!

888
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:17,050
That was absolutely a lie!

889
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:17,450
Okay!

890
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:18,790
Okay!

891
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:22,330
If we live, things will be okay!

892
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:24,450
If we live...

893
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:39,360
I don't think we are gonna live anymore!

894
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:44,740
I don't think we are gonna live anymore!

895
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:45,100
Oh my god!

896
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:46,000
I'm trying...

897
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:49,240
I'm trying so hard!

898
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:52,840
Please!

899
00:45:58,460 --> 00:45:59,260
Please kill him!

900
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:00,720
Oh my god!

901
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:02,300
I have to do so much!

902
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:05,580
Alright!

903
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:06,340
That's fine!

904
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,220
These games are getting a little harder now, guys!

905
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:12,760
These games are actually getting a little...

906
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:13,520
Oh my god!

907
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:15,200
These games are getting really hard now!

908
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:21,680
I don't know if it's because I've been playing rivals for 12 hours straight!

909
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:23,280
Or maybe...

910
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:25,380
People are getting better!

911
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,700
Or maybe I'm playing against pro players!

912
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:29,820
I don't know!

913
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,940
Not pro players, but like, you know what I mean!

914
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,560
Players who may be like, top 500!

915
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:40,420
I can't tell!

916
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:46,490
I can't tell!

917
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:49,810
I'm not getting bursted this time!

918
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:50,870
I'm standing behind a tree!

919
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:51,570
I don't care!

920
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:52,290
I'm standing behind a tree!

921
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:52,730
Oh my god!

922
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:59,810
How did I stand behind a tree?

923
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:08,530
How did I stand behind a tree?

924
00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:11,850
I'm standing behind a tree!

925
00:47:12,010 --> 00:47:12,550
I'm standing behind a tree!

926
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:14,370
I'm standing behind a tree!

927
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:15,610
I'm standing behind a tree!

928
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,170
I'm standing behind a tree!

929
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:19,410
I'm standing behind a tree!

930
00:47:19,930 --> 00:47:23,110
I'm standing behind a tree!

931
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:26,850
She's actually trolling.

932
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:30,150
I didn't.

933
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:33,090
I didn't.

934
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:39,330
It's almost like I didn't fuck up.

935
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:41,750
No one knew I fucked up.

936
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:43,650
No one knew.

937
00:47:44,350 --> 00:47:45,310
Relay deployed.

938
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:46,450
It ain't cheap.

939
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:54,870
Three Relay Replayers for Deep plus three ChatGPT coin flip.

940
00:47:55,830 --> 00:47:57,870
I don't recall you or your bandit.

941
00:47:57,870 --> 00:47:58,490
All right.

942
00:47:58,670 --> 00:47:59,130
Nice, guys.

943
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:00,230
We did it, guys.

944
00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:00,930
Whippy!

945
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:07,630
I don't know what that is.

946
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:08,490
Wait.

947
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:13,780
That's right.

948
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,220
It's not fucking up.

949
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:17,360
Four, three, two, one.

950
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:20,180
It's not fucking up if I wander around.

951
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:24,340
No, it's good that I died.

952
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:29,260
Because me dying allowed my team to clutch it.

953
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,960
Because I didn't ult too early.

954
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:33,860
You know?

955
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:36,400
I'm cooking right now.

956
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:42,840
Because I... Because by managing to... Oh my god.

957
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:43,760
There's like so many things.

958
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,120
By managing to ult later.

959
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:47,340
My team.

960
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,620
I don't think we're gonna live, though.

961
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:53,540
Whoa.

962
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:55,000
Wait.

963
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:55,620
I fucked up.

964
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:57,360
I fucked up.

965
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:03,420
Exactly.

966
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:05,120
I fucked up.

967
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:06,260
I fucked up my spade.

968
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:06,780
My jump.

969
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,680
So, me dying was actually a good thing.

970
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:15,240
If you think about it.

971
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:24,180
Because by dying, I was able to stall my ult usage so my TPS could use the ult better.

972
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:28,660
So, you guys didn't see me miss those two shots.

973
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:32,580
That didn't happen.

974
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:36,740
Jesus Christ.

975
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:42,220
Oh my god.

976
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:47,020
Okay, nice.

977
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,020
My... Is that the...

978
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:51,720
I can't tell.

979
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:52,340
Yeah, that is right.

980
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:57,340
Oh, I thought I would hit that.

981
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:58,180
I didn't hit that.

982
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:00,860
Oh my god.

983
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:01,660
I could use it.

984
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:03,300
I didn't want to mirror it.

985
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:05,060
But I didn't believe...

986
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:06,060
Oh my god.

987
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:07,080
Oh wait.

988
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:08,040
They're running triple support.

989
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:08,380
Wait.

990
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,000
That's cheating.

991
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:11,920
Oh no.

992
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:12,980
Oh no.

993
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:13,480
He knows.

994
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:18,800
That's fine.

995
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:27,140
Guys, we gotta kill this one guy.

996
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:27,900
Please.

997
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,140
I can still...

998
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:32,380
I can stay alive for one more.

999
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:33,580
Please.

1000
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:35,320
I can't stay alive anymore.

1001
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:35,740
Please.

1002
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,000
We didn't cap!

1003
00:50:43,390 --> 00:50:43,970
No!

1004
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:49,050
Oh my god.

1005
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:52,330
Oh my god.

1006
00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:52,730
Please.

1007
00:50:54,570 --> 00:50:55,970
I can't do anything.

1008
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:02,490
Okay.

1009
00:51:11,930 --> 00:51:12,810
Oh my god.

1010
00:51:12,810 --> 00:51:13,590
Is it time?

1011
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:15,790
They're running triple support!

1012
00:51:16,530 --> 00:51:17,790
That's cheating!

1013
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:24,400
All I ever wanted to do was sing, really.

1014
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:28,800
279.

1015
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,220
They are frying me.

1016
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:45,740
I'll play my life more.

1017
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:46,820
I like you.

1018
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:49,160
I like you.

1019
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:50,660
Don't queue up tomorrow.

1020
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:50,760
tomorrow.

1021
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:51,500
Hahaha!

1022
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,180
The fire of you.

1023
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:54,660
The charming.

1024
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:56,020
The dangerous.

1025
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:01,410
The battle starts in five.

1026
00:52:01,710 --> 00:52:02,330
Four.

1027
00:52:03,070 --> 00:52:03,270
Three.

1028
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:03,730
Alright.

1029
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:04,450
Let's go.

1030
00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:04,950
Two.

1031
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:05,290
One.

1032
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:08,650
All you need to do is capture the mission area.

1033
00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:09,510
Got it?

1034
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:12,990
Today we fight as ours.

1035
00:52:12,990 --> 00:52:14,050
I still hate this map.

1036
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:17,050
Do not give me reason to alter that arrangement.

1037
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:19,770
I have to wait.

1038
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:21,030
I have to wait for my team.

1039
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:27,370
Could you, uh, just spin in?

1040
00:52:27,490 --> 00:52:28,530
Alright, I'll go on the spin.

1041
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:32,270
I really got triple res.

1042
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:33,530
Maybe if you fit in?

1043
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:35,210
Should I just run at him?

1044
00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:35,870
Maybe?

1045
00:52:42,610 --> 00:52:46,790
Oh my god, I thought... Why did I rock and not up?

1046
00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:48,810
Oh!

1047
00:52:48,810 --> 00:52:49,710
Oh my god.

1048
00:52:52,410 --> 00:52:53,670
I thought I rock it with ult.

1049
00:52:57,390 --> 00:52:58,410
That was my bad.

1050
00:52:58,870 --> 00:53:00,370
I should have ulted that, I guess.

1051
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:03,310
I wonder if I should run at him.

1052
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:07,960
Maybe.

1053
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:11,960
Maybe if I ran at him, it would be easier.

1054
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:17,690
I don't know, cause like, it's so hard to tell.

1055
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:20,330
Because like, he usually ult first.

1056
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:23,490
So I don't want to double support ult and everything.

1057
00:53:23,770 --> 00:53:25,370
I guess cause it's like...

1058
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:28,990
I guess cause it's like...

1059
00:53:28,990 --> 00:53:29,990
Oh wait, he fucked it up.

1060
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:32,310
I'm gonna save.

1061
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:37,110
Because it's a hella ult, I should have ulted first.

1062
00:53:37,670 --> 00:53:38,530
Jesus, okay.

1063
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:41,590
I can do this.

1064
00:53:44,110 --> 00:53:45,450
Don't worry, guys.

1065
00:53:47,110 --> 00:53:48,870
I am ready to put on a show.

1066
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:49,250
The ult.

1067
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:51,910
I'm worried again.

1068
00:53:55,950 --> 00:53:57,010
Don't worry, guys.

1069
00:53:57,350 --> 00:53:58,450
I'm a little worried.

1070
00:53:59,710 --> 00:54:00,790
I'm very worried.

1071
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:07,040
What?

1072
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,520
Oh my god, goodbye!

1073
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,080
My life is gone!

1074
00:54:13,270 --> 00:54:13,790
Goodbye!

1075
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:15,410
I...

1076
00:54:15,410 --> 00:54:16,890
My life is gone.

1077
00:54:17,110 --> 00:54:17,610
What's next?

1078
00:54:17,970 --> 00:54:19,070
Do we even have a plan?

1079
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,350
I'm making a comeback.

1080
00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:24,270
I was not surviving that.

1081
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:26,950
I saw her slowly walk up to...

1082
00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:27,750
She like...

1083
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:29,910
She like, iced my ice.

1084
00:54:30,170 --> 00:54:31,390
And then she...

1085
00:54:31,390 --> 00:54:32,870
Yeah, I knew it was over.

1086
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:35,410
I was like, within a confined area.

1087
00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:37,830
Like, there was no way I was living that.

1088
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:42,190
I was in a fucking confined room.

1089
00:54:42,890 --> 00:54:44,870
I knew it was over for me.

1090
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:53,620
Okay.

1091
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:00,680
I think if we ran triple sub.

1092
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:01,880
For our...

1093
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,240
For our, uh...

1094
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:07,620
Starlord.

1095
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:08,760
It might be easier.

1096
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:15,020
Or just add him.

1097
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:16,740
Just for our Starlord.

1098
00:55:22,450 --> 00:55:24,270
Oh, I'm trying, buddy!

1099
00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:26,350
But you have to admit!

1100
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:29,970
Oh my god, my...

1101
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:30,810
Crosshair...

1102
00:55:30,810 --> 00:55:32,290
My dot is so tiny now.

1103
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:33,090
That...

1104
00:55:33,090 --> 00:55:35,230
I'm trying...

1105
00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:38,770
I just realized...

1106
00:55:38,770 --> 00:55:39,610
Okay, my...

1107
00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:41,650
The dot is really, really tiny.

1108
00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:43,210
For...

1109
00:55:43,930 --> 00:55:45,330
For my crosshair.

1110
00:55:45,330 --> 00:55:46,370
But, like...

1111
00:55:46,370 --> 00:55:48,410
I played for so long...

1112
00:55:48,410 --> 00:55:51,090
That it might be too tiny now.

1113
00:55:55,670 --> 00:55:56,350
It...

1114
00:55:57,090 --> 00:55:59,790
It might be a little too tiny.

1115
00:56:01,550 --> 00:56:02,230
Fantastic!

1116
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:05,250
I am ready to put on a show!

1117
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:06,310
Live!

1118
00:56:06,670 --> 00:56:07,150
Live!

1119
00:56:09,490 --> 00:56:10,170
Okay.

1120
00:56:11,870 --> 00:56:12,570
Five...

1121
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:13,970
Four...

1122
00:56:14,770 --> 00:56:15,470
Three...

1123
00:56:16,190 --> 00:56:16,890
Two...

1124
00:56:16,890 --> 00:56:17,950
One...

1125
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:18,910
Oh my god, he missed!

1126
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:28,450
Okay, nice!

1127
00:56:28,850 --> 00:56:29,870
Oh, not nice!

1128
00:56:30,030 --> 00:56:30,510
Not nice!

1129
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:31,930
I had to reload!

1130
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:32,470
I'm sorry!

1131
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:33,730
I'm sorry!

1132
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:37,550
I had to reload!

1133
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:45,380
Nice!

1134
00:56:50,850 --> 00:56:52,230
He punching them!

1135
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:52,770
Nice!

1136
00:56:53,630 --> 00:56:53,980
Yeah!

1137
00:56:54,430 --> 00:56:54,750
Yay!

1138
00:56:57,630 --> 00:56:59,730
The dot is so tiny!

1139
00:57:00,070 --> 00:57:01,070
And I was like...

1140
00:57:01,070 --> 00:57:02,090
Wait...

1141
00:57:02,090 --> 00:57:03,210
Playing for too long!

1142
00:57:03,450 --> 00:57:04,550
Where is the dot?

1143
00:57:05,210 --> 00:57:05,890
Where...

1144
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:08,000
Where's my crosshair?

1145
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:10,330
I can't see it anymore!

1146
00:57:10,690 --> 00:57:12,030
It's so tiny!

1147
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:14,470
Yay!

1148
00:57:14,650 --> 00:57:15,790
I'm back to Celeste 2!

1149
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:20,210
Yay!

1150
00:57:24,970 --> 00:57:25,930
Celeste 2!

1151
00:57:26,130 --> 00:57:26,870
Plus 4!

1152
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:28,430
I think...

1153
00:57:28,430 --> 00:57:31,150
Gomez said he's done after he gets back to Celeste 1!

1154
00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:32,050
Look at that!

1155
00:57:32,470 --> 00:57:34,110
He made me carry him!

1156
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:35,590
And he's just gonna leave!

1157
00:57:36,630 --> 00:57:37,010
Just...

1158
00:57:37,010 --> 00:57:37,590
Like...

1159
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:37,970
That!

1160
00:57:41,850 --> 00:57:42,990
He lost...

1161
00:57:43,370 --> 00:57:44,690
So much elo!

1162
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:46,670
Before!

1163
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:48,810
And now he's just gonna leave!

1164
00:57:49,410 --> 00:57:51,010
Just like that!

1165
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:52,010
Ha ha ha!

1166
00:57:53,030 --> 00:57:53,950
Ha ha ha!

1167
00:57:54,850 --> 00:57:56,230
Ha ha ha!

1168
00:57:58,490 --> 00:58:00,350
But you said the same about Celeste 2!

1169
00:58:00,470 --> 00:58:02,970
I said the same about it...

1170
00:58:02,970 --> 00:58:03,990
On YouTube!

1171
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:05,790
Twitch is different!

1172
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:07,250
Ha ha ha!

1173
00:58:09,230 --> 00:58:11,830
We played by different rules!

1174
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:13,690
Here...

1175
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:14,730
We played!

1176
00:58:15,110 --> 00:58:17,050
I said that on YouTube!

1177
00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:19,510
To... It's different.

1178
00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:23,650
That one.

1179
00:58:25,410 --> 00:58:26,490
Alright.

1180
00:58:28,410 --> 00:58:30,050
It's Kendrick.

1181
00:58:32,310 --> 00:58:33,390
Okay.

1182
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:36,270
No one's online except for...

1183
00:58:36,270 --> 00:58:38,650
The Koreans.

1184
00:58:39,710 --> 00:58:41,390
And Pearl, the European.

1185
00:58:42,610 --> 00:58:45,970
No one's online except for the Koreans.

1186
00:58:45,970 --> 00:58:47,810
And the European.

1187
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:49,850
Alright.

1188
00:58:50,830 --> 00:58:52,190
I can do it.

1189
00:58:53,090 --> 00:58:54,530
Maybe I can kidnap somebody.

1190
00:58:55,750 --> 00:58:57,610
I'm a very social person.

1191
00:59:00,130 --> 00:59:02,210
I can like...

1192
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:06,150
I can charisma my way into stealing someone.

1193
00:59:06,930 --> 00:59:07,270
I...

1194
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:10,810
I'm not.

1195
00:59:11,070 --> 00:59:11,930
That's a lie.

1196
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:14,230
Wait, is Pearl still top 10?

1197
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:16,550
Oh.

1198
00:59:17,010 --> 00:59:18,110
Wait, what happened?

1199
00:59:18,290 --> 00:59:18,990
Pearl was eternity.

1200
00:59:19,710 --> 00:59:21,330
Oh, they hid their history.

1201
00:59:21,810 --> 00:59:22,510
Oh, no.

1202
00:59:23,290 --> 00:59:23,630
Yeah.

1203
00:59:23,990 --> 00:59:24,890
Pearl was...

1204
00:59:24,890 --> 00:59:25,970
Pearl was eternity.

1205
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:27,410
What the fuck happened?

1206
00:59:29,210 --> 00:59:31,130
Okay, but has D-Dobby been winning?

1207
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:33,470
God, I can't tell.

1208
00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:35,870
I can't tell.

1209
00:59:38,130 --> 00:59:40,210
Oh, D-Dobby was having good games.

1210
00:59:41,650 --> 00:59:42,470
Oh, my God.

1211
00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:43,330
Do you think...

1212
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:44,670
Wait, Celestial too?

1213
00:59:45,010 --> 00:59:45,550
Oh, wait.

1214
00:59:45,630 --> 00:59:46,250
He's been winning.

1215
00:59:47,430 --> 00:59:48,230
Wait, no.

1216
00:59:48,970 --> 00:59:49,990
He was four stacking.

1217
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:51,750
Or three stacking.

1218
00:59:54,070 --> 00:59:55,610
Wait, it was three stacking?

1219
00:59:57,170 --> 00:59:59,070
Oh, I think he ended his stack.

1220
01:00:00,370 --> 01:00:01,250
No, D-Dobby.

1221
01:00:02,110 --> 01:00:03,190
This guy.

1222
01:00:03,590 --> 01:00:04,470
Right here.

1223
01:00:10,030 --> 01:00:11,230
Our winning son.

1224
01:00:12,890 --> 01:00:14,890
We tried to kidnap Choppa.

1225
01:00:23,530 --> 01:00:24,330
Choppa.

1226
01:00:27,830 --> 01:00:29,430
Yellow TTK.

1227
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:32,530
Do you want to play?

1228
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:34,690
Gomez left.

1229
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:39,710
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

1230
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:45,110
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

1231
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:52,210
All right.

1232
01:00:52,490 --> 01:00:53,290
What's the rank at?

1233
01:00:53,490 --> 01:00:55,630
I'm currently Celestial too.

1234
01:00:56,370 --> 01:00:58,370
Top 500 is at...

1235
01:00:59,810 --> 01:01:02,150
Oh, he's with March right now.

1236
01:01:02,150 --> 01:01:04,750
Top 500 is at...

1237
01:01:07,630 --> 01:01:08,430
At...

1238
01:01:08,430 --> 01:01:09,650
High GM...

1239
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:11,050
High Celestial too.

1240
01:01:11,330 --> 01:01:12,130
So I'm like...

1241
01:01:12,130 --> 01:01:14,710
I literally have to be at the end of it.

1242
01:01:16,230 --> 01:01:17,030
Okay.

1243
01:01:18,590 --> 01:01:19,390
Okay.

1244
01:01:22,050 --> 01:01:24,130
I hope you lose...

1245
01:01:24,130 --> 01:01:24,970
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1246
01:01:25,010 --> 01:01:25,410
No!

1247
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:31,150
I hope you win lots...

1248
01:01:31,150 --> 01:01:32,090
But inside...

1249
01:01:32,090 --> 01:01:32,630
I'm like...

1250
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:33,990
I hope you lose...

1251
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:34,330
I...

1252
01:01:34,330 --> 01:01:36,170
In the inside...

1253
01:01:36,170 --> 01:01:37,670
I'm like...

1254
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:38,750
I hope...

1255
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:39,850
No, I hope...

1256
01:01:39,850 --> 01:01:40,310
I saw!

1257
01:01:40,650 --> 01:01:40,970
No!

1258
01:01:45,170 --> 01:01:46,330
Guys, I lied.

1259
01:01:46,490 --> 01:01:48,070
I hope he wins a lot, guys.

1260
01:01:48,070 --> 01:01:48,570
I...

1261
01:01:49,590 --> 01:01:50,230
I...

1262
01:01:52,450 --> 01:01:53,090
I...

1263
01:01:53,090 --> 01:01:54,210
I...

1264
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:54,590
I would never...

1265
01:01:55,550 --> 01:01:56,190
Ha ha ha...

1266
01:01:56,190 --> 01:01:56,990
Say that.

1267
01:01:57,450 --> 01:01:58,690
I would never...

1268
01:01:58,690 --> 01:01:59,590
Guys, no.

1269
01:01:59,790 --> 01:02:00,110
I...

1270
01:02:00,110 --> 01:02:02,210
What I meant is that...

1271
01:02:02,210 --> 01:02:04,890
I hope he wins a lot of games.

1272
01:02:05,510 --> 01:02:06,530
Guys, I...

1273
01:02:06,530 --> 01:02:06,990
I would...

1274
01:02:06,990 --> 01:02:07,590
I would never!

1275
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:09,390
Why would I ever say that?

1276
01:02:09,590 --> 01:02:11,030
Why would I never...

1277
01:02:11,030 --> 01:02:12,890
Why would I ever say that to him?

1278
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:14,270
I...

1279
01:02:14,270 --> 01:02:16,490
Ha ha ha...

1280
01:02:16,490 --> 01:02:18,090
Ha ha ha...

1281
01:02:19,390 --> 01:02:20,890
That's fucked, guys.

1282
01:02:21,890 --> 01:02:23,070
That's fucked.

1283
01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:24,430
Oh, oh, wait.

1284
01:02:25,050 --> 01:02:29,850
It's because I read it from my chat out loud.

1285
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:33,010
I know I would never read it.

1286
01:02:33,150 --> 01:02:34,190
Ha ha ha!

1287
01:02:34,990 --> 01:02:35,350
Ha ha ha!

1288
01:02:35,350 --> 01:02:35,690
Ha ha ha!

1289
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:37,030
Ha ha ha!

1290
01:02:37,030 --> 01:02:39,110
Ha ha ha!

1291
01:02:40,270 --> 01:02:41,150
Ha ha ha!

1292
01:02:41,770 --> 01:02:42,310
Blame...

1293
01:02:42,310 --> 01:02:44,230
Don't blame us!

1294
01:02:44,910 --> 01:02:45,610
Ha ha ha!

1295
01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:46,290
What do you mean?

1296
01:02:46,670 --> 01:02:48,230
I remember I saw this one guy.

1297
01:02:48,370 --> 01:02:49,070
What was his name?

1298
01:02:49,930 --> 01:02:50,470
Del...

1299
01:02:50,470 --> 01:02:50,970
Dada?

1300
01:02:51,270 --> 01:02:54,010
He, like, said I hope he loses.

1301
01:02:54,330 --> 01:02:54,750
I...

1302
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:55,090
Yeah.

1303
01:02:55,470 --> 01:02:56,330
I saw...

1304
01:02:56,330 --> 01:02:57,350
I saw...

1305
01:02:57,350 --> 01:03:00,530
Del Dada typing that out in my chat.

1306
01:03:00,790 --> 01:03:01,610
And then...

1307
01:03:01,610 --> 01:03:03,070
And then I, like, just...

1308
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:04,070
I just read it out.

1309
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:04,890
Ha ha ha!

1310
01:03:05,170 --> 01:03:06,310
I just read it out!

1311
01:03:06,310 --> 01:03:13,110
Oh my god, I can't believe you guys would say such a thing to our homie, Chapa.

1312
01:03:14,070 --> 01:03:16,150
I can't believe it.

1313
01:03:24,250 --> 01:03:26,770
I would never, guys.

1314
01:03:32,270 --> 01:03:33,790
Alright, wait.

1315
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:39,830
Okay, I'm trying to like see people I know that might be able to kidnap.

1316
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:41,530
I want to play a little bit more.

1317
01:03:42,870 --> 01:03:44,350
Who can I kidnap?

1318
01:03:45,090 --> 01:03:46,790
Who's online right now?

1319
01:03:47,030 --> 01:03:49,190
Who do I, have I bumped into a lot?

1320
01:03:49,470 --> 01:03:50,690
That's online.

1321
01:03:51,610 --> 01:03:55,430
That's on, that's online right now.

1322
01:03:57,010 --> 01:03:57,810
Hmm.

1323
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:01,510
Okay.

1324
01:04:04,070 --> 01:04:06,630
Alright, if I can find...

1325
01:04:06,630 --> 01:04:11,570
If I can find one person, then okay, I'm gonna kidnap someone.

1326
01:04:12,950 --> 01:04:14,670
That I know is solo.

1327
01:04:16,330 --> 01:04:19,250
I don't know what this person is, but they added me.

1328
01:04:20,330 --> 01:04:22,330
I'm gonna kidnap somebody.

1329
01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:24,310
But like, legally.

1330
01:04:25,510 --> 01:04:27,210
Where I won't get arrested.

1331
01:04:34,090 --> 01:04:35,050
Oh, Cal!

1332
01:04:35,590 --> 01:04:35,950
Okay.

1333
01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:37,230
I'll add Cal.

1334
01:04:37,730 --> 01:04:38,850
I've seen him around.

1335
01:04:39,670 --> 01:04:40,670
He's actually pretty.

1336
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:42,350
He's like, in Overwatch League, right?

1337
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:47,830
He's like...

1338
01:04:47,830 --> 01:04:52,150
He used to be an Overwatch League support player, and he played for Envy.

1339
01:04:54,210 --> 01:04:54,770
Alright.

1340
01:04:56,850 --> 01:04:58,470
We play one game solo.

1341
01:04:59,230 --> 01:05:01,270
Oh my god, I could lose Celestia too.

1342
01:05:07,350 --> 01:05:08,310
I could...

1343
01:05:08,310 --> 01:05:09,050
I could...

1344
01:05:09,050 --> 01:05:09,770
Alright.

1345
01:05:12,510 --> 01:05:13,850
Yeah, he was in...

1346
01:05:13,850 --> 01:05:14,990
I don't remember which team though.

1347
01:05:15,230 --> 01:05:15,990
I remember...

1348
01:05:15,990 --> 01:05:17,730
Cal was in Overwatch League.

1349
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:20,430
But I legitimately don't know which team it was.

1350
01:05:20,610 --> 01:05:21,970
I just know he was there.

1351
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:30,160
I'm trying to...

1352
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:30,700
I'm trying to...

1353
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:31,780
Let's see.

1354
01:05:33,620 --> 01:05:34,660
Let's do...

1355
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:35,300
You know what?

1356
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:37,320
No, I...

1357
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:39,320
If I lose one solo game, that's over.

1358
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:40,140
That I...

1359
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:41,500
There's a high...

1360
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:42,700
I wish they'd bring back this.

1361
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:43,720
Wait, they did!

1362
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:45,540
I love this game mode.

1363
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:47,600
Oh, but it's everybody!

1364
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:48,120
Aww!

1365
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:51,040
Wait, okay.

1366
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:55,360
Let's try this real fast.

1367
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:56,680
I'm sad.

1368
01:06:00,610 --> 01:06:01,550
No, it's okay.

1369
01:06:01,870 --> 01:06:03,470
There's no way I'd lose Celestia.

1370
01:06:04,090 --> 01:06:05,090
There's no way.

1371
01:06:05,530 --> 01:06:06,050
Celestia too.

1372
01:06:09,330 --> 01:06:10,850
Wait, so how does this work?

1373
01:06:17,170 --> 01:06:18,170
How does this work?

1374
01:06:18,170 --> 01:06:19,750
Oh

1375
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:26,500
my god, it's...

1376
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:26,900
Shit.

1377
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:28,440
Oh, okay.

1378
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:30,480
I...

1379
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:31,480
I...

1380
01:06:37,580 --> 01:06:38,560
That's...

1381
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:39,160
Difficult.

1382
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:41,600
I don't know.

1383
01:06:44,330 --> 01:06:45,120
Oh, I...

1384
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:46,200
I don't play either.

1385
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:48,740
I don't think...

1386
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:51,700
This combo fucking sucks.

1387
01:06:55,780 --> 01:06:57,180
Okay, how do I play this?

1388
01:06:58,280 --> 01:06:59,100
Okay, how do I play this?

1389
01:06:59,100 --> 01:06:59,480
Okay, that's the...

1390
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:00,260
Straight shift.

1391
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:01,800
Okay, I know how now.

1392
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:06,520
Where are they?

1393
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:09,260
Oh my god.

1394
01:07:10,020 --> 01:07:11,520
Oh my god.

1395
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:12,220
Get me out of here.

1396
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:13,380
Get me...

1397
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:15,500
Jesus Christ.

1398
01:07:15,860 --> 01:07:16,340
You know what?

1399
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:16,840
I...

1400
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:17,880
I'm gonna do Jeff.

1401
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:19,680
I think...

1402
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:22,440
I...

1403
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:22,780
Wait!

1404
01:07:23,020 --> 01:07:23,120
No!

1405
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:23,420
Wait!

1406
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:26,240
My head is so fucking big, I forgot about it!

1407
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:31,440
I forgot how big my goddamn head is!

1408
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:34,160
My head is literally the body!

1409
01:07:34,420 --> 01:07:35,720
You can still turn this around!

1410
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:39,700
I hate this.

1411
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:40,760
I...

1412
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:41,560
Never mind.

1413
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:42,540
This game mode sucks.

1414
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:45,520
This game mode actually sucks.

1415
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:49,440
Oh my god.

1416
01:07:50,660 --> 01:07:53,460
My head is my fucking body.

1417
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:55,220
What the fuck?

1418
01:07:59,770 --> 01:08:00,850
Here we go.

1419
01:08:03,450 --> 01:08:04,250
Okay.

1420
01:08:04,930 --> 01:08:05,730
Get out of here.

1421
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:08,050
How the fuck?

1422
01:08:08,690 --> 01:08:10,030
I need a swap.

1423
01:08:10,490 --> 01:08:14,690
I honestly think Scarlet was infinitely a lot easier.

1424
01:08:14,870 --> 01:08:16,370
What have to do?

1425
01:08:19,890 --> 01:08:20,510
It's fine.

1426
01:08:21,050 --> 01:08:21,750
We're fine.

1427
01:08:24,030 --> 01:08:24,910
We're so fine.

1428
01:08:25,070 --> 01:08:25,670
We're so healthy.

1429
01:08:27,730 --> 01:08:28,510
Look at that.

1430
01:08:28,690 --> 01:08:29,250
I'm gaming.

1431
01:08:30,150 --> 01:08:31,010
I'm not gaming.

1432
01:08:31,690 --> 01:08:32,710
I'm not gaming.

1433
01:08:32,850 --> 01:08:33,870
I saw two people.

1434
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:39,940
Alright, it's fine.

1435
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:42,560
I can make friends.

1436
01:08:43,940 --> 01:08:44,640
There you go.

1437
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:45,760
Get me over here.

1438
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:47,680
I wish I knew how to do this.

1439
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:48,680
Apparently it's like...

1440
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:50,180
Oh my god.

1441
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:50,860
Get me out of here.

1442
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:51,500
You won't know.

1443
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:57,920
I'm trying to remember... I don't know the tech where, like, you're supposed... You're gonna be able to swim fast or some shit.

1444
01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:00,020
Goodbye.

1445
01:09:01,660 --> 01:09:02,920
Oh my god.

1446
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:04,560
Like...

1447
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:05,440
Goodbye.

1448
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:06,460
Goodbye.

1449
01:09:06,820 --> 01:09:07,380
Goodbye!

1450
01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:14,230
Like, what do I do?

1451
01:09:15,090 --> 01:09:16,510
In that situation!

1452
01:09:17,410 --> 01:09:18,690
There are so many!

1453
01:09:18,690 --> 01:09:18,770
The looks of me.

1454
01:09:20,170 --> 01:09:22,010
It's- They, like, coordinated that shit!

1455
01:09:24,870 --> 01:09:25,730
Wait, I heard somebody.

1456
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:30,840
Oh my god.

1457
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:32,240
This is a hate crime.

1458
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:35,200
I went to the wrong street.

1459
01:09:40,630 --> 01:09:41,710
Okay, buddy.

1460
01:09:45,790 --> 01:09:46,890
Jesus Christ.

1461
01:09:48,010 --> 01:09:51,110
Give me... give me a better character for this!

1462
01:09:52,490 --> 01:09:59,610
I missed it when like... when like it was... it was literally like you can pick your own.

1463
01:09:59,730 --> 01:10:00,750
I don't like the clone one.

1464
01:10:01,550 --> 01:10:02,790
I have learned that...

1465
01:10:02,790 --> 01:10:04,030
I do not like the clone.

1466
01:10:06,510 --> 01:10:07,450
Come on.

1467
01:10:07,810 --> 01:10:09,850
We need... Please don't die, guys.

1468
01:10:13,030 --> 01:10:13,750
Oh.

1469
01:10:15,150 --> 01:10:16,830
Get me out of here.

1470
01:10:17,230 --> 01:10:17,670
No!

1471
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:23,940
No, I should've stuck with Scarlet!

1472
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:29,680
Because they all actually mean something!

1473
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:32,260
Please don't die.

1474
01:10:33,420 --> 01:10:33,820
Oh.

1475
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:35,360
Please.

1476
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:35,540
Please.

1477
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:37,900
The final 10 seconds.

1478
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:40,260
Please, we need two kills!

1479
01:10:41,660 --> 01:10:42,140
No.

1480
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:43,780
No.

1481
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:45,500
Let me kill her.

1482
01:10:46,820 --> 01:10:47,180
No!

1483
01:10:49,690 --> 01:10:51,870
Well, you can't expect to win them all.

1484
01:10:51,890 --> 01:10:52,510
I'm sad.

1485
01:10:52,730 --> 01:10:53,430
We were so close.

1486
01:10:55,330 --> 01:10:56,910
I should've went Scarlet.

1487
01:10:58,570 --> 01:11:01,970
I just didn't feel it because I don't play Scarlet that much.

1488
01:11:02,430 --> 01:11:03,110
Okay, I'll do one more.

1489
01:11:03,630 --> 01:11:04,650
I'll do one more.

1490
01:11:04,870 --> 01:11:06,210
I need a better character.

1491
01:11:07,610 --> 01:11:10,830
I... I... Jeff and Scarlet was just not it.

1492
01:11:11,130 --> 01:11:18,750
I swear to God, if they give me any melee characters... in the next one... I'm never touching the big head mode again.

1493
01:11:21,190 --> 01:11:22,790
I need to get my glasses fixed.

1494
01:11:23,570 --> 01:11:26,010
You know like the... the end part of the glasses?

1495
01:11:26,230 --> 01:11:28,550
Like the... um... the hook stuff?

1496
01:11:29,530 --> 01:11:30,470
What is it called?

1497
01:11:31,210 --> 01:11:33,550
Guys, I've been playing Rivals for like more than 12 hours.

1498
01:11:33,710 --> 01:11:35,210
My brain is not working anymore.

1499
01:11:35,430 --> 01:11:36,190
Like the...

1500
01:11:36,190 --> 01:11:40,210
when you... The... Oh my god.

1501
01:11:40,230 --> 01:11:40,990
What is it called?

1502
01:11:42,890 --> 01:11:47,690
Where you... The thing that hooks... No, no, no.

1503
01:11:49,170 --> 01:11:52,570
The frame area where it hooks onto your... Oh my god.

1504
01:11:52,770 --> 01:11:53,290
Thank you.

1505
01:11:53,670 --> 01:11:55,190
Oh my god.

1506
01:11:55,730 --> 01:11:56,750
Thank you.

1507
01:12:00,430 --> 01:12:02,690
Okay, I might die so fast.

1508
01:12:02,970 --> 01:12:03,530
I'm...

1509
01:12:05,470 --> 01:12:07,310
The leg... Is that... Is it called legs?

1510
01:12:09,370 --> 01:12:11,510
I hate... I have my... The thing.

1511
01:12:11,650 --> 01:12:15,830
You know how like they have like the... Um... A covering over it?

1512
01:12:16,570 --> 01:12:18,250
The thing keeps like falling off.

1513
01:12:18,370 --> 01:12:19,650
Cause it's like ripped open a little.

1514
01:12:19,830 --> 01:12:20,730
And I need to get that fixed.

1515
01:12:24,530 --> 01:12:24,950
Whee.

1516
01:12:25,310 --> 01:12:26,510
I know that's like a waste.

1517
01:12:26,730 --> 01:12:28,570
But like... I don't care.

1518
01:12:29,570 --> 01:12:30,970
Oh my god.

1519
01:12:30,970 --> 01:12:31,150
Why.

1520
01:12:35,830 --> 01:12:36,630
What the.

1521
01:12:36,770 --> 01:12:37,090
What the ?

1522
01:12:37,090 --> 01:12:38,610
Please sum... Where the health packs in this game mode?

1523
01:12:38,930 --> 01:12:39,930
They've come from behind.

1524
01:12:40,350 --> 01:12:41,470
But you can still turn this around.

1525
01:12:41,470 --> 01:12:41,910
Okay.

1526
01:12:42,370 --> 01:12:42,950
Okay.

1527
01:12:43,150 --> 01:12:45,050
We have... Nobody once to play Luna.

1528
01:12:45,370 --> 01:12:45,890
And I...

1529
01:12:45,890 --> 01:12:47,310
I understand.

1530
01:12:51,710 --> 01:12:52,810
I understand.

1531
01:12:54,110 --> 01:12:54,810
I understand.

1532
01:12:59,490 --> 01:13:01,930
Why would anyone wanna play...

1533
01:13:01,930 --> 01:13:02,510
Wanna...

1534
01:13:02,530 --> 01:13:06,650
Oh, why would anyone want to play support in this game mode?

1535
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:11,280
Here you go.

1536
01:13:12,220 --> 01:13:13,900
I haven't played Hell in a while though.

1537
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:17,920
Let me get up here.

1538
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:20,620
And then I get my own little sniper perch.

1539
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:24,200
And nothing bad will happen to me while I'm up here.

1540
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:28,700
Oh my god, JK.

1541
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:31,040
Oh my god, he's won.

1542
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:32,820
Please.

1543
01:13:33,860 --> 01:13:34,760
He's killing me.

1544
01:13:35,740 --> 01:13:36,520
Oh, okay.

1545
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:38,520
That's a little awkward.

1546
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:40,160
Please don't hit me, please don't hit me.

1547
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:41,020
There we go.

1548
01:13:42,700 --> 01:13:43,100
Nice.

1549
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:47,260
Oh my god, they're lined up so perfectly.

1550
01:13:47,820 --> 01:13:48,820
Oh my god.

1551
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:51,400
Thank you.

1552
01:13:53,860 --> 01:13:55,060
Please, stay there.

1553
01:13:55,380 --> 01:13:56,060
Just stay there.

1554
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:58,880
Oh my god, this is like the perfect area for me.

1555
01:13:59,100 --> 01:13:59,360
No!

1556
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:01,360
No!

1557
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:02,400
Oh, nice, okay.

1558
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:03,620
That's fine.

1559
01:14:07,870 --> 01:14:08,850
Please just stay there.

1560
01:14:09,310 --> 01:14:09,830
God damn it.

1561
01:14:10,530 --> 01:14:11,670
It's just so perfect.

1562
01:14:13,510 --> 01:14:15,910
It's actually like so good for me to be there.

1563
01:14:17,730 --> 01:14:18,150
Nice.

1564
01:14:21,900 --> 01:14:23,280
Come on, come on, come on.

1565
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:26,700
Come on, come on.

1566
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,460
Just keep staying there.

1567
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:29,340
Just keep...

1568
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:29,600
No!

1569
01:14:29,980 --> 01:14:30,740
Come back to that!

1570
01:14:34,170 --> 01:14:38,070
Please, I only know how to snipe that one particular high ground.

1571
01:14:43,870 --> 01:14:45,510
Am I the first one with ult?

1572
01:14:46,030 --> 01:14:47,170
Oh my god, I am.

1573
01:14:47,970 --> 01:14:48,550
I am.

1574
01:14:48,790 --> 01:14:49,890
That's fucking hilarious.

1575
01:14:52,190 --> 01:14:53,330
That's fucking right.

1576
01:14:53,770 --> 01:14:56,010
Oh my god, it's almost time though.

1577
01:14:56,250 --> 01:14:58,890
Everybody's gonna have all the ults too.

1578
01:15:00,030 --> 01:15:01,130
Oh, there it is!

1579
01:15:01,430 --> 01:15:02,930
Oh, there it is!

1580
01:15:05,190 --> 01:15:06,690
I'm not respawning.

1581
01:15:06,950 --> 01:15:07,670
Give me a sec.

1582
01:15:07,910 --> 01:15:09,690
I'm not respawning.

1583
01:15:09,890 --> 01:15:11,130
Give me a sec.

1584
01:15:12,730 --> 01:15:14,630
I heard so many.

1585
01:15:16,590 --> 01:15:18,590
I'm not respawning.

1586
01:15:18,910 --> 01:15:19,890
Get me out of here.

1587
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:24,290
They caught up just because of everybody ulting.

1588
01:15:24,790 --> 01:15:26,030
That's fucking crazy.

1589
01:15:30,050 --> 01:15:32,790
I would say Hela is like one of the easiest DPS.

1590
01:15:33,130 --> 01:15:35,890
If you can aim, because it's literally...

1591
01:15:36,830 --> 01:15:38,330
It's literally point and click.

1592
01:15:41,570 --> 01:15:44,110
I think Hela is one of the easiest because of it.

1593
01:15:46,290 --> 01:15:50,490
As long as you put your crosshair over somebody, it's easy to kill.

1594
01:15:51,450 --> 01:15:54,110
Compared to like the other DPS characters.

1595
01:15:56,090 --> 01:15:57,870
That's just my personal opinion.

1596
01:15:58,490 --> 01:15:58,810
On Hela.

1597
01:16:03,550 --> 01:16:04,230
No!

1598
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:11,160
Did I do it most?

1599
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:12,960
Yeah, I carried!

1600
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:14,660
Let's go!

1601
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:19,140
I guess like...

1602
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:20,020
You gotta know...

1603
01:16:20,020 --> 01:16:21,500
Um, well, as like a...

1604
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:22,760
Like a carry character.

1605
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:24,240
I think...

1606
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:25,560
Am I the only one with no skin?

1607
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:26,080
Oh wait, no.

1608
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:26,860
It's because I'm MVP.

1609
01:16:27,140 --> 01:16:27,240
No.

1610
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:27,860
Oh yeah.

1611
01:16:28,220 --> 01:16:29,440
I was gonna say...

1612
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:31,440
Everyone has like so many...

1613
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:32,940
Everyone has skins for it.

1614
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:33,940
Yay!

1615
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:37,080
Okay.

1616
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:38,120
Do I do it, guys?

1617
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:40,280
Do I...

1618
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:42,860
Do I risk it?

1619
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:43,760
Do I...

1620
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:55,740
Do I risk the Marvel rival guys to potentially give us a good game?

1621
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,700
Solo queue is a trap!

1622
01:16:59,620 --> 01:17:01,140
Don't listen to them!

1623
01:17:01,140 --> 01:17:01,200
Don't listen to them!

1624
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:04,800
But my...

1625
01:17:05,380 --> 01:17:06,920
My inner...

1626
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:08,920
My inner thoughts...

1627
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:10,780
They want me to play...

1628
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:12,440
One more...

1629
01:17:13,340 --> 01:17:14,200
Just...

1630
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:20,200
They're like...

1631
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:21,620
Okay, I'll do...

1632
01:17:21,620 --> 01:17:22,360
Okay, how about this?

1633
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:24,720
I'll do one more.

1634
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:26,220
How about that?

1635
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:29,060
Just one more.

1636
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:32,400
And then...

1637
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:34,720
And then like...

1638
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:36,360
Obviously, if it doesn't work, I...

1639
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:36,960
I stop.

1640
01:17:37,180 --> 01:17:37,760
But like...

1641
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:38,680
If it works...

1642
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:40,060
If it works, then like...

1643
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:41,920
I get...

1644
01:17:42,740 --> 01:17:43,540
You know...

1645
01:17:43,540 --> 01:17:44,420
I win a game.

1646
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:44,920
You know?

1647
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:46,360
If it works, then like...

1648
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:47,780
Everything is good for me.

1649
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:48,340
You know?

1650
01:17:51,790 --> 01:17:53,110
Okay, but like...

1651
01:17:53,110 --> 01:17:53,910
It's just...

1652
01:17:53,910 --> 01:17:54,830
One more though.

1653
01:17:55,830 --> 01:17:56,830
Guys, it's just...

1654
01:17:59,250 --> 01:18:00,010
One more.

1655
01:18:02,530 --> 01:18:03,770
If we win, we win.

1656
01:18:05,630 --> 01:18:06,790
If we lose...

1657
01:18:08,290 --> 01:18:09,170
Then like...

1658
01:18:09,170 --> 01:18:09,550
I don't know.

1659
01:18:09,630 --> 01:18:10,650
I guess we Q and I...

1660
01:18:10,650 --> 01:18:11,470
No, I'm joking.

1661
01:18:12,450 --> 01:18:13,970
We don't do that to ourselves.

1662
01:18:14,150 --> 01:18:14,710
Of course not.

1663
01:18:15,350 --> 01:18:16,050
Of course not.

1664
01:18:16,170 --> 01:18:17,270
I'm not that...

1665
01:18:17,270 --> 01:18:17,890
Crazy.

1666
01:18:17,890 --> 01:18:18,090
Crazy.

1667
01:18:18,450 --> 01:18:18,670
Crazy.

1668
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:21,100
Unless...

1669
01:18:21,450 --> 01:18:22,170
Whoa!

1670
01:18:22,810 --> 01:18:24,790
Unless I do Q another.

1671
01:18:28,950 --> 01:18:29,950
Who knows?

1672
01:18:30,530 --> 01:18:31,970
Things could be different, guys.

1673
01:18:37,020 --> 01:18:37,720
Alright.

1674
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:38,920
We'll see.

1675
01:18:44,730 --> 01:18:47,190
Yeah, it's like, you know...

1676
01:18:47,190 --> 01:18:48,230
It's like a little test.

1677
01:18:48,690 --> 01:18:49,950
A test of wills.

1678
01:18:52,850 --> 01:18:54,250
Like, yeah, exactly.

1679
01:18:54,570 --> 01:18:55,070
Exactly.

1680
01:18:56,510 --> 01:18:57,750
Things could work out.

1681
01:19:00,510 --> 01:19:03,890
I'm not trying to convince myself because I know where I stand.

1682
01:19:08,050 --> 01:19:09,330
And like...

1683
01:19:09,330 --> 01:19:09,730
Isn't...

1684
01:19:10,450 --> 01:19:12,710
Isn't gambling the best part?

1685
01:19:12,970 --> 01:19:13,810
The thrill of it?

1686
01:19:21,910 --> 01:19:22,930
That's the best part.

1687
01:19:26,530 --> 01:19:28,470
My mind knows where it is at.

1688
01:19:33,420 --> 01:19:34,580
And it's okay.

1689
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:36,280
It's legal because I live in Canada.

1690
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:37,440
It's...

1691
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:40,300
That's why a lot of people move back and move to Canada.

1692
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:41,680
Uh...

1693
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:42,400
Move to Canada.

1694
01:19:42,660 --> 01:19:43,920
To keep on gambling!

1695
01:19:44,740 --> 01:19:45,460
It's okay.

1696
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:46,640
It's legal, guys.

1697
01:19:46,860 --> 01:19:47,400
I'm Canadian.

1698
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:49,440
I can do it.

1699
01:19:59,030 --> 01:20:00,270
That's the best part.

1700
01:20:00,810 --> 01:20:02,570
Is that... No, it's actually true.

1701
01:20:02,710 --> 01:20:07,090
Okay, so you know... Okay, the people that take, like, online gambling sponsors...

1702
01:20:08,210 --> 01:20:12,570
You can't take online gambling sponsors if you're American.

1703
01:20:13,670 --> 01:20:16,130
Because it's like... You have, like, a limit or something.

1704
01:20:16,330 --> 01:20:18,490
I'm not sure about the full details.

1705
01:20:18,770 --> 01:20:23,830
But if you take online gambling sponsors, it's most likely you live outside of America.

1706
01:20:24,150 --> 01:20:27,390
Because it's actually, like, not very legal to do.

1707
01:20:29,690 --> 01:20:32,170
So, like... This is my gambling.

1708
01:20:33,530 --> 01:20:34,890
Nobody gets hurt.

1709
01:20:35,290 --> 01:20:39,430
And everyone... Everyone... Just doesn't sleep.

1710
01:20:39,730 --> 01:20:40,730
Other than not sleeping.

1711
01:20:41,010 --> 01:20:41,670
But it's okay.

1712
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:43,350
Financially, we're okay.

1713
01:20:44,190 --> 01:20:44,870
Finan...

1714
01:20:47,550 --> 01:20:49,230
Financially, we're okay.

1715
01:20:49,930 --> 01:20:51,210
Physically and mentally.

1716
01:20:51,210 --> 01:20:54,230
We might have shaved a couple of years off of our lifespan.

1717
01:20:54,790 --> 01:20:55,670
But that's okay.

1718
01:20:56,010 --> 01:20:57,450
We're here to have a good time.

1719
01:20:58,510 --> 01:21:01,430
It's Shidoki's gambling over sanity.

1720
01:21:02,030 --> 01:21:03,650
Oh, dang it.

1721
01:21:04,010 --> 01:21:05,870
I'm falling into sleep.

1722
01:21:06,310 --> 01:21:08,850
No, into sleep debt.

1723
01:21:10,550 --> 01:21:11,750
Oh my god, you're right.

1724
01:21:12,050 --> 01:21:13,290
It's, like, sleep debt, right?

1725
01:21:13,290 --> 01:21:14,190
So, like...

1726
01:21:14,190 --> 01:21:17,990
But then, like, if I sleep more tomorrow, then I can regain the debt.

1727
01:21:18,470 --> 01:21:19,830
I can pay off the debt.

1728
01:21:19,990 --> 01:21:22,030
And I can do it all over again.

1729
01:21:26,890 --> 01:21:30,950
Shidoki's gambling with your health is insane, bro.

1730
01:21:34,830 --> 01:21:36,350
Wait, then...

1731
01:21:36,350 --> 01:21:36,810
How...

1732
01:21:36,810 --> 01:21:38,410
No, it should...

1733
01:21:38,410 --> 01:21:40,330
Wait, it should work.

1734
01:21:40,330 --> 01:21:41,450
Because, like...

1735
01:21:41,450 --> 01:21:42,870
If I sleep more...

1736
01:21:42,870 --> 01:21:43,410
Then, like...

1737
01:21:43,410 --> 01:21:46,030
It's like I put a deposit in my sleep bank.

1738
01:21:46,030 --> 01:21:51,330
So, I put a deposit in my sleep bank if I sleep more than the average seven hours.

1739
01:21:51,730 --> 01:21:56,010
So, like, whenever I don't sleep, my body takes the...

1740
01:21:56,010 --> 01:21:58,930
Like, takes the money in my sleep savings account.

1741
01:21:59,170 --> 01:22:03,490
And then, by taking money off of my sleep savings account, um...

1742
01:22:04,090 --> 01:22:05,690
I can be a regular person again.

1743
01:22:09,670 --> 01:22:11,030
It's simple bank.

1744
01:22:11,750 --> 01:22:13,210
I am the...

1745
01:22:15,010 --> 01:22:17,330
Which hero do you think you want to be today?

1746
01:22:17,330 --> 01:22:19,890
This is a GM lobby!

1747
01:22:23,770 --> 01:22:25,530
Oh, no.

1748
01:22:26,250 --> 01:22:27,670
This is...

1749
01:22:27,670 --> 01:22:31,790
Why am I in a GM lobby?

1750
01:22:32,050 --> 01:22:34,530
I'm Celestial, too!

1751
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:42,040
Oh, man.

1752
01:22:42,980 --> 01:22:44,520
They ban Hulk?

1753
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:45,260
Hulk?

1754
01:22:48,820 --> 01:22:50,620
It's a bad thing!

1755
01:22:50,940 --> 01:22:51,440
Because...

1756
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:54,700
If I lose in a GM lobby...

1757
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:57,400
I lose so much Elo.

1758
01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:01,680
Why is no one banning Human Torch first?

1759
01:23:02,180 --> 01:23:02,700
I...

1760
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:02,960
Okay.

1761
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:04,320
I was like...

1762
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:08,760
I was gonna freak out if they did not ban Human Torch.

1763
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:21,860
It's okay.

1764
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:26,760
Thank God.

1765
01:23:26,980 --> 01:23:28,360
I was gonna be like...

1766
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:29,020
Oh my God.

1767
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:32,180
Why do we not have a Human Torch?

1768
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:34,560
Like the moon, I shine in darkness.

1769
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:36,960
The right heroes could make all the difference.

1770
01:23:38,060 --> 01:23:38,600
Oh!

1771
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:41,280
I don't know about this.

1772
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:45,220
Now I'm a little worried.

1773
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:54,160
Okay.

1774
01:23:54,720 --> 01:23:55,360
There we go.

1775
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:58,260
Because I know Rocket builds at first.

1776
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:00,180
And now...

1777
01:24:03,220 --> 01:24:03,860
Guys.

1778
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:06,100
I think I might have...

1779
01:24:06,620 --> 01:24:08,580
I think I might have fucked up.

1780
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:13,460
I might have gambled a little too hard.

1781
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:17,980
Wait.

1782
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:19,520
Is that what it's like to solo?

1783
01:24:19,940 --> 01:24:20,660
Oh my God.

1784
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:22,000
So cute.

1785
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:22,780
It was a mistake.

1786
01:24:29,130 --> 01:24:29,630
Okay.

1787
01:24:32,350 --> 01:24:33,310
I'm not a Doomer.

1788
01:24:34,450 --> 01:24:35,710
I'm not a Doomer, guys.

1789
01:24:36,010 --> 01:24:36,850
We got this.

1790
01:24:39,410 --> 01:24:42,170
I will trust my Grandmaster team.

1791
01:24:43,330 --> 01:24:45,170
Surely they know what they're doing.

1792
01:24:49,260 --> 01:24:50,540
Oh, it's Dive.

1793
01:24:50,900 --> 01:24:51,520
Oh no.

1794
01:24:57,450 --> 01:24:58,310
Oh no.

1795
01:24:58,470 --> 01:24:59,470
It's Iron Man Dive.

1796
01:25:03,210 --> 01:25:03,810
Wait.

1797
01:25:04,010 --> 01:25:04,070
What?

1798
01:25:04,130 --> 01:25:04,870
I missed that?

1799
01:25:06,310 --> 01:25:07,970
I'm surprised I missed it.

1800
01:25:08,610 --> 01:25:09,530
Oh my God.

1801
01:25:09,650 --> 01:25:10,710
It's Spider-Man Dive.

1802
01:25:11,170 --> 01:25:12,790
Oh my God.

1803
01:25:14,070 --> 01:25:15,090
It's Spider-Man.

1804
01:25:15,590 --> 01:25:16,150
It's...

1805
01:25:16,770 --> 01:25:18,370
It's Spider-Man Dive.

1806
01:25:19,030 --> 01:25:21,050
Oh, it's Spider-Man Dive.

1807
01:25:25,110 --> 01:25:25,670
It's...

1808
01:25:25,670 --> 01:25:27,050
Okay, it's fine.

1809
01:25:28,150 --> 01:25:30,570
Maybe the GM players are the Dive players.

1810
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:36,300
Oh my God.

1811
01:25:36,420 --> 01:25:36,820
Maybe...

1812
01:25:36,820 --> 01:25:38,200
I think it might be...

1813
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:38,560
Wait.

1814
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:40,200
I think they might be...

1815
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:41,180
Because what the fuck was that?

1816
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:50,600
Oh my God.

1817
01:25:50,700 --> 01:25:51,340
I might be dead though.

1818
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:53,540
Yeah, no.

1819
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:54,940
I think they might be...

1820
01:25:54,940 --> 01:25:55,260
Because what?

1821
01:25:57,180 --> 01:25:57,740
Oh yeah.

1822
01:25:57,940 --> 01:25:59,100
No, their GM players are...

1823
01:25:59,100 --> 01:26:01,060
Their GM players are...

1824
01:26:01,060 --> 01:26:02,300
Yeah, it's their GM players.

1825
01:26:05,020 --> 01:26:05,440
It's...

1826
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:06,220
It's...

1827
01:26:06,220 --> 01:26:08,360
It's 100% the GM players that are Dive.

1828
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:12,220
After what I went through of like real players who...

1829
01:26:12,220 --> 01:26:13,840
I'm like...

1830
01:26:14,540 --> 01:26:17,780
Like, guys, after what we saw...

1831
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:21,200
Yeah, 100%.

1832
01:26:26,670 --> 01:26:27,430
That's good.

1833
01:26:27,790 --> 01:26:29,110
That's actually good for us.

1834
01:26:29,670 --> 01:26:31,510
These guys don't know how to actually die.

1835
01:26:31,710 --> 01:26:32,790
Thank fucking God.

1836
01:26:33,410 --> 01:26:34,570
Thank God.

1837
01:26:34,570 --> 01:26:35,010
I...

1838
01:26:36,430 --> 01:26:38,050
Okay, I have to use that.

1839
01:26:40,890 --> 01:26:41,490
Oh.

1840
01:26:42,530 --> 01:26:42,710
Oh.

1841
01:26:43,750 --> 01:26:44,170
Alright.

1842
01:26:45,030 --> 01:26:46,710
They have Spider-Man on...

1843
01:26:46,710 --> 01:26:46,870
Though.

1844
01:26:48,370 --> 01:26:49,010
Wait, again?

1845
01:26:49,310 --> 01:26:49,990
Oh, wait.

1846
01:26:51,950 --> 01:26:53,110
This is where I die.

1847
01:26:53,590 --> 01:26:55,050
This is actually where I die.

1848
01:26:57,710 --> 01:26:59,510
We definitely might...

1849
01:26:59,510 --> 01:27:00,710
Maybe not...

1850
01:27:00,710 --> 01:27:01,810
Should have used...

1851
01:27:01,810 --> 01:27:04,770
I have no idea why we used...

1852
01:27:05,670 --> 01:27:06,090
Uh...

1853
01:27:06,090 --> 01:27:07,310
Captain America out there.

1854
01:27:07,470 --> 01:27:08,250
But that's so...

1855
01:27:08,250 --> 01:27:08,490
Oh.

1856
01:27:08,590 --> 01:27:08,830
Oh, wait.

1857
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:09,190
That's good.

1858
01:27:19,330 --> 01:27:20,170
That's good.

1859
01:27:21,430 --> 01:27:22,210
But yeah, no.

1860
01:27:22,350 --> 01:27:24,590
They definitely did not know how to do that.

1861
01:27:25,410 --> 01:27:25,990
Oh, no.

1862
01:27:26,030 --> 01:27:26,510
That's not good.

1863
01:27:27,470 --> 01:27:28,150
Oh, my God.

1864
01:27:28,370 --> 01:27:28,490
What?

1865
01:27:28,710 --> 01:27:29,830
He like ricocheted.

1866
01:27:30,490 --> 01:27:31,810
So I couldn't...

1867
01:27:31,810 --> 01:27:32,450
I'm sad.

1868
01:27:33,050 --> 01:27:34,070
He actually ricocheted.

1869
01:27:34,210 --> 01:27:35,090
So I couldn't...

1870
01:27:38,930 --> 01:27:39,710
Oh, my God.

1871
01:27:39,930 --> 01:27:39,990
Oh, my God.

1872
01:27:43,210 --> 01:27:44,750
I have to go sue.

1873
01:27:45,590 --> 01:27:47,290
I have to go sue for this.

1874
01:27:48,670 --> 01:27:51,930
I cannot play Luna in that cop.

1875
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:57,460
That sucks.

1876
01:27:57,940 --> 01:28:00,400
I have to go sue because of the dive.

1877
01:28:02,980 --> 01:28:04,420
Oh, we're not capping.

1878
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:07,980
I thought I could get away with it.

1879
01:28:07,980 --> 01:28:08,960
But, like...

1880
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:10,660
That's much better.

1881
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:12,140
It's actually too much.

1882
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:17,880
But I can just keep my shield for the dive.

1883
01:28:18,060 --> 01:28:20,060
Because they're not that great at dive.

1884
01:28:20,820 --> 01:28:21,460
But...

1885
01:28:23,420 --> 01:28:24,560
But, like...

1886
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:25,640
It's still annoying.

1887
01:28:30,350 --> 01:28:30,990
Nice.

1888
01:28:32,510 --> 01:28:33,290
Oh, wait.

1889
01:28:33,350 --> 01:28:34,510
They went Captain America, too.

1890
01:28:38,030 --> 01:28:38,830
That's fine.

1891
01:28:44,420 --> 01:28:45,940
We just have to stay here.

1892
01:28:49,630 --> 01:28:50,230
Okay.

1893
01:28:50,550 --> 01:28:50,810
I'm okay.

1894
01:28:52,690 --> 01:28:53,290
Alright.

1895
01:28:53,410 --> 01:28:53,750
We're fine.

1896
01:28:54,070 --> 01:28:54,610
We're fine.

1897
01:28:55,970 --> 01:28:58,070
Are our players here okay, though?

1898
01:28:58,750 --> 01:28:59,290
Nice.

1899
01:28:59,850 --> 01:29:00,370
We're fine.

1900
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:06,840
Like, normally I wouldn't...

1901
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:09,440
I would swap the sue right off the bat.

1902
01:29:09,780 --> 01:29:10,660
But, like...

1903
01:29:10,660 --> 01:29:12,740
They're really bad at dive.

1904
01:29:12,740 --> 01:29:13,440
They're...

1905
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:16,160
They are...

1906
01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:16,920
They are...

1907
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:18,140
Not good at...

1908
01:29:18,140 --> 01:29:18,540
At...

1909
01:29:18,540 --> 01:29:18,960
At...

1910
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:19,200
At...

1911
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:20,560
At Spider-Man Venom.

1912
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:21,680
And we...

1913
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:23,500
You guys have watched, like...

1914
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:24,340
You know...

1915
01:29:24,340 --> 01:29:25,480
Sort of, like...

1916
01:29:25,740 --> 01:29:27,600
A lot of hours already?

1917
01:29:28,360 --> 01:29:29,120
Of...

1918
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:31,640
Of, like, actual good Spider-Man players?

1919
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:33,060
And...

1920
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:33,200
Yeah.

1921
01:29:38,360 --> 01:29:41,440
So, you guys already know what good Spider-Man...

1922
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:42,900
What good dive is like.

1923
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:44,220
And this...

1924
01:29:44,220 --> 01:29:45,080
These guys were not it.

1925
01:29:47,460 --> 01:29:48,300
Alright, nice.

1926
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:50,260
What happened?

1927
01:29:52,140 --> 01:29:54,060
What the fuck is going on here?

1928
01:29:58,570 --> 01:29:59,470
Alright, nice.

1929
01:30:00,110 --> 01:30:03,350
I cannot wait to get plus 18 afterwards.

1930
01:30:09,710 --> 01:30:11,130
Yeah, I can...

1931
01:30:11,130 --> 01:30:11,930
Basically, I'm shutting...

1932
01:30:11,930 --> 01:30:12,290
Yeah, they...

1933
01:30:12,290 --> 01:30:12,930
See, they swapped off.

1934
01:30:13,370 --> 01:30:14,810
I SWAPED OFF!

1935
01:30:15,210 --> 01:30:16,550
See, I told you!

1936
01:30:17,090 --> 01:30:17,750
I told you!

1937
01:30:17,990 --> 01:30:19,210
They already swapped off!

1938
01:30:20,690 --> 01:30:21,730
That's pretty funny.

1939
01:30:23,390 --> 01:30:24,450
They already...

1940
01:30:24,450 --> 01:30:26,590
They already swapped off, guys.

1941
01:30:27,170 --> 01:30:28,930
They already swapped off dive.

1942
01:30:29,430 --> 01:30:29,830
See, they...

1943
01:30:29,830 --> 01:30:31,050
Because they couldn't do anything!

1944
01:30:31,050 --> 01:30:32,510
Because I'm on Sue now!

1945
01:30:34,210 --> 01:30:36,310
They literally can't do anything anymore!

1946
01:30:39,550 --> 01:30:41,550
I would say Cloak is actually...

1947
01:30:41,550 --> 01:30:42,310
Not...

1948
01:30:43,450 --> 01:30:43,890
Like...

1949
01:30:47,370 --> 01:30:49,310
Okay, just to save our Strange.

1950
01:30:49,530 --> 01:30:50,230
I need to save him.

1951
01:30:51,110 --> 01:30:52,330
And then we can kill our...

1952
01:30:52,330 --> 01:30:52,870
We can kill him.

1953
01:30:53,090 --> 01:30:53,290
Yep.

1954
01:30:56,190 --> 01:30:58,410
Okay, I have to do this to save our Strange.

1955
01:30:58,870 --> 01:30:59,210
But...

1956
01:31:00,110 --> 01:31:00,890
Oh my gosh.

1957
01:31:01,270 --> 01:31:02,530
I wish I...

1958
01:31:02,530 --> 01:31:03,770
My guy was...

1959
01:31:03,770 --> 01:31:05,450
Honour to serve alongside...

1960
01:31:05,450 --> 01:31:10,080
I'm just trying to save him.

1961
01:31:10,120 --> 01:31:10,660
Feeling fantastic.

1962
01:31:12,380 --> 01:31:13,440
I had to...

1963
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:14,140
Oh, I had to...

1964
01:31:14,140 --> 01:31:15,400
I had to...

1965
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:16,740
Try and do something there.

1966
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:18,260
Keep fighting until we have a winner.

1967
01:31:18,620 --> 01:31:21,020
Okay, now that they're finally...

1968
01:31:21,020 --> 01:31:22,380
I can play this now.

1969
01:31:23,900 --> 01:31:24,940
I can't...

1970
01:31:24,940 --> 01:31:25,400
Oh, wait.

1971
01:31:30,230 --> 01:31:31,710
The reason why I'm doing this...

1972
01:31:31,710 --> 01:31:32,770
Is because like...

1973
01:31:32,770 --> 01:31:33,390
Um...

1974
01:31:33,390 --> 01:31:34,950
I know that they already...

1975
01:31:35,830 --> 01:31:37,830
I know they don't have...

1976
01:31:40,890 --> 01:31:41,710
Bucky ult anymore.

1977
01:31:41,890 --> 01:31:43,290
So I can play this character.

1978
01:31:46,590 --> 01:31:47,930
And this character is...

1979
01:31:47,930 --> 01:31:49,010
Oh, that's bad.

1980
01:31:50,930 --> 01:31:51,330
Whoops.

1981
01:31:51,550 --> 01:31:52,970
I thought he was gonna throw it at me.

1982
01:31:53,190 --> 01:31:53,990
Ha ha ha ha!

1983
01:31:56,830 --> 01:31:58,210
I know I can play Loki...

1984
01:31:58,210 --> 01:31:59,250
Because they already used Bucky ult.

1985
01:31:59,370 --> 01:32:00,050
So I'm not scared.

1986
01:32:01,890 --> 01:32:02,490
There you go.

1987
01:32:02,490 --> 01:32:03,670
Yeah!

1988
01:32:05,390 --> 01:32:06,990
The current score is...

1989
01:32:06,990 --> 01:32:08,290
Zero...

1990
01:32:08,290 --> 01:32:09,170
Two...

1991
01:32:09,170 --> 01:32:09,830
One...

1992
01:32:11,210 --> 01:32:12,870
Time to switch things...

1993
01:32:12,870 --> 01:32:13,450
I knew...

1994
01:32:13,450 --> 01:32:15,090
The funny thing is that...

1995
01:32:15,090 --> 01:32:16,810
Like, literally...

1996
01:32:16,810 --> 01:32:18,170
The Venom and Spider-Man...

1997
01:32:18,170 --> 01:32:21,090
Did not dive at the same time.

1998
01:32:21,530 --> 01:32:23,710
I was so confused.

1999
01:32:24,330 --> 01:32:24,570
Like the moon...

2000
01:32:24,570 --> 01:32:26,110
I shine in darkness.

2001
01:32:29,910 --> 01:32:30,710
Like...

2002
01:32:30,710 --> 01:32:31,410
I was...

2003
01:32:31,410 --> 01:32:32,610
That's when I knew.

2004
01:32:35,710 --> 01:32:38,690
They were not diving at the same time.

2005
01:32:39,050 --> 01:32:40,470
For some fucking reason.

2006
01:32:43,270 --> 01:32:45,210
Yeah, they kept going in...

2007
01:32:45,730 --> 01:32:46,070
Separately.

2008
01:32:47,570 --> 01:32:48,130
Round two.

2009
01:32:48,370 --> 01:32:50,470
All I never wanted to do was sing, really.

2010
01:32:52,390 --> 01:32:52,830
Fools.

2011
01:32:53,390 --> 01:32:56,170
Do you truly believe you can stop my grand scheme?

2012
01:32:56,470 --> 01:32:57,470
Guys, we're doing a really good job.

2013
01:32:58,010 --> 01:32:59,250
Ha ha ha ha!

2014
01:33:02,210 --> 01:33:03,630
30 seconds before you attack.

2015
01:33:03,910 --> 01:33:04,530
Get ready.

2016
01:33:09,130 --> 01:33:10,190
They were...

2017
01:33:10,190 --> 01:33:12,290
No, they were just really pretty...

2018
01:33:12,290 --> 01:33:13,570
Really pretty bad.

2019
01:33:13,770 --> 01:33:14,970
Yeah, I like my cat gameplay.

2020
01:33:16,290 --> 01:33:17,010
Diving.

2021
01:33:17,370 --> 01:33:17,510
Yeah.

2022
01:33:18,890 --> 01:33:20,630
They were diving...

2023
01:33:20,630 --> 01:33:21,610
Separately.

2024
01:33:22,390 --> 01:33:22,710
Separately.

2025
01:33:22,710 --> 01:33:23,930
Ha ha ha ha ha!

2026
01:33:24,950 --> 01:33:25,990
Ha ha ha ha!

2027
01:33:25,990 --> 01:33:28,010
The battle starts in five...

2028
01:33:28,010 --> 01:33:28,670
Four...

2029
01:33:28,670 --> 01:33:29,730
Three...

2030
01:33:29,730 --> 01:33:30,990
Two...

2031
01:33:30,990 --> 01:33:31,350
One!

2032
01:33:32,090 --> 01:33:36,010
Get that Beagle!

2033
01:33:36,010 --> 01:33:36,230
Two...

2034
01:33:36,230 --> 01:33:39,450
No, they were actually just pretty bad at doing the whole dive shit.

2035
01:33:44,150 --> 01:33:44,710
Alright.

2036
01:33:51,560 --> 01:33:52,300
My god.

2037
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:53,200
My mouse...

2038
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:53,580
I...

2039
01:33:53,580 --> 01:33:55,240
Ran out of mousepad's face there.

2040
01:33:57,180 --> 01:34:02,260
Because I positioned my mouse at the edge of my... Wait, fuck, what?

2041
01:34:02,360 --> 01:34:02,980
That didn't hit?

2042
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:04,400
Surprise.

2043
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:10,140
I was like, what?

2044
01:34:10,220 --> 01:34:10,920
Why didn't that hit?

2045
01:34:15,850 --> 01:34:17,510
Oh, they landed his free push?

2046
01:34:18,090 --> 01:34:18,570
Okay.

2047
01:34:21,290 --> 01:34:22,550
Oh my god, it sucks.

2048
01:34:23,170 --> 01:34:27,990
I'm not hitting... I'm not hitting my freezes, which is not good.

2049
01:34:29,230 --> 01:34:30,290
Oh my god.

2050
01:34:30,410 --> 01:34:30,710
Okay.

2051
01:34:31,590 --> 01:34:32,790
Might be dead though.

2052
01:34:34,290 --> 01:34:36,230
Oh, he put it behind me!

2053
01:34:40,210 --> 01:34:42,310
Oh, they swapped tank players.

2054
01:34:44,050 --> 01:34:44,750
Unlucky.

2055
01:34:46,870 --> 01:34:48,450
They swapped tank players.

2056
01:34:52,870 --> 01:34:53,570
No!

2057
01:34:54,030 --> 01:34:56,170
Why couldn't they be the same player?

2058
01:34:57,750 --> 01:35:00,010
Why did they have to swap?

2059
01:35:05,900 --> 01:35:06,680
Oh, I don't know.

2060
01:35:06,860 --> 01:35:07,620
Oh, they live!

2061
01:35:09,900 --> 01:35:10,640
They live.

2062
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:23,280
I was worried I was going to get one shot, so I didn't want to risk it.

2063
01:35:23,820 --> 01:35:25,580
I was not risking that shit.

2064
01:35:25,820 --> 01:35:26,320
Okay, right there.

2065
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:28,860
I was not risking that.

2066
01:35:32,970 --> 01:35:33,890
That's huge, that's huge!

2067
01:35:34,230 --> 01:35:35,030
That's your support!

2068
01:35:36,810 --> 01:35:37,210
Nice.

2069
01:35:37,210 --> 01:35:37,970
Almost there!

2070
01:35:38,110 --> 01:35:39,110
Don't turn back now!

2071
01:35:39,310 --> 01:35:46,170
Like, I was not being cocky over... I was gonna let the... Bucky... One-shot me.

2072
01:35:48,930 --> 01:35:50,470
They wasted a lot of ult.

2073
01:35:50,670 --> 01:35:51,190
No, they did.

2074
01:35:51,290 --> 01:35:51,970
Keep up the momentum!

2075
01:35:52,450 --> 01:35:53,550
Guys, I told you.

2076
01:35:56,130 --> 01:35:58,770
Yeah, I... I didn't want to get one shot.

2077
01:36:00,790 --> 01:36:01,550
I got to worry.

2078
01:36:01,850 --> 01:36:04,470
I think because we have...

2079
01:36:06,690 --> 01:36:09,670
Hey guys, we should, like, you know, push the card a little bit.

2080
01:36:10,030 --> 01:36:13,290
Because we have, like, two DPS that's sort of, like, stationary.

2081
01:36:14,990 --> 01:36:15,390
Like...

2082
01:36:16,870 --> 01:36:19,570
Just because I need to make sure it does... I need to pre-heal him.

2083
01:36:20,110 --> 01:36:21,730
So he doesn't fucking die.

2084
01:36:26,830 --> 01:36:29,470
I swapped the snowflake when...

2085
01:36:31,870 --> 01:36:32,630
Oh...

2086
01:36:32,630 --> 01:36:33,730
Alright, you get snowflake now.

2087
01:36:34,250 --> 01:36:34,630
Maximal...

2088
01:36:35,010 --> 01:36:36,810
Alright, you might...

2089
01:36:36,810 --> 01:36:37,470
Ohhhh!

2090
01:36:39,670 --> 01:36:40,430
Whoaaaah!

2091
01:36:41,630 --> 01:36:43,330
Yeah, he wasn't living that.

2092
01:36:44,790 --> 01:36:46,690
But that was insane.

2093
01:36:46,690 --> 01:36:52,250
I mad fucking Kobe that shit.

2094
01:36:53,830 --> 01:36:54,790
Poor Dave.

2095
01:36:54,790 --> 01:36:56,530
Unless we stack.

2096
01:36:57,170 --> 01:36:58,130
Unless we stack.

2097
01:36:58,850 --> 01:37:01,830
The moment we... Oh my god.

2098
01:37:02,230 --> 01:37:03,030
That was unlucky.

2099
01:37:03,550 --> 01:37:05,030
I literally just got it.

2100
01:37:10,210 --> 01:37:11,850
Oh... Nice.

2101
01:37:16,460 --> 01:37:16,870
Yay!

2102
01:37:23,220 --> 01:37:25,410
Solo lost the game for your team.

2103
01:37:26,930 --> 01:37:27,290
Who?

2104
01:37:30,710 --> 01:37:32,870
Like you did last game.

2105
01:37:33,090 --> 01:37:33,250
What?

2106
01:37:33,650 --> 01:37:36,590
Is there... There's a pre-existing beef.

2107
01:37:37,370 --> 01:37:38,090
Like...

2108
01:37:38,910 --> 01:37:39,270
What?

2109
01:37:41,650 --> 01:37:43,090
What is...

2110
01:37:43,930 --> 01:37:45,230
What are... Oh, look at that.

2111
01:37:45,430 --> 01:37:46,230
My... Oh, man.

2112
01:37:46,710 --> 01:37:47,430
Yummy, yummy.

2113
01:37:47,810 --> 01:37:48,530
Plus 18.

2114
01:37:50,490 --> 01:37:54,790
I was like, what pre-existing beef did you guys have?

2115
01:37:56,350 --> 01:37:56,870
Like...

2116
01:37:58,450 --> 01:37:59,630
Oh my... Oops.

2117
01:37:59,830 --> 01:38:00,710
I was gonna... Oh, man.

2118
01:38:00,750 --> 01:38:01,570
I wanted to watch more.

2119
01:38:02,830 --> 01:38:06,790
I wanted to know more about this pre-existing fight that they have.

2120
01:38:06,790 --> 01:38:07,650
Alright, guys.

2121
01:38:07,870 --> 01:38:08,030
See?

2122
01:38:08,230 --> 01:38:08,890
Look at that.

2123
01:38:09,170 --> 01:38:09,890
The gambling.

2124
01:38:10,410 --> 01:38:12,910
It paid off in the end.

2125
01:38:13,110 --> 01:38:14,970
Which means... I have one...

2126
01:38:16,710 --> 01:38:18,330
I get one more life.

2127
01:38:18,330 --> 01:38:18,530
My life.

2128
01:38:18,610 --> 01:38:18,970
Haha.

2129
01:38:21,290 --> 01:38:22,630
Which means guys...

2130
01:38:22,630 --> 01:38:23,330
Technically...

2131
01:38:23,870 --> 01:38:25,370
I can keep going.

2132
01:38:26,510 --> 01:38:27,190
Cuz...

2133
01:38:27,190 --> 01:38:28,110
I got...

2134
01:38:28,110 --> 01:38:29,350
One more life from that.

2135
01:38:29,690 --> 01:38:30,350
Oh my god.

2136
01:38:31,630 --> 01:38:32,670
It's like...

2137
01:38:32,670 --> 01:38:33,530
Plus two years.

2138
01:38:33,730 --> 01:38:34,610
Every win...

2139
01:38:34,610 --> 01:38:35,590
Increases...

2140
01:38:36,310 --> 01:38:36,650
Increases...

2141
01:38:37,110 --> 01:38:38,170
Decreases my sleep debt.

2142
01:38:38,170 --> 01:38:40,450
I can't.

2143
01:38:41,690 --> 01:38:44,190
It's time to gamble again.

2144
01:38:46,210 --> 01:38:49,210
I won a GM game, guys.

2145
01:38:50,950 --> 01:38:53,190
What if I could hit jackpot?

2146
01:38:54,410 --> 01:38:59,170
Guys, but like, think about the jackpot that I could hit.

2147
01:39:01,390 --> 01:39:05,230
Yeah, like, tomorrow I have it.

2148
01:39:06,290 --> 01:39:08,470
Tomorrow I have words.

2149
01:39:14,490 --> 01:39:28,380
Okay, but like, if I win... Guys... Guys, if I win, I'm... I have two more lives.

2150
01:39:28,380 --> 01:39:29,380
It's right.

2151
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:36,900
Guys, just think, if I win, I have two more lives.

2152
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:42,080
And I'm like, this much, this closer to top 500.

2153
01:39:42,360 --> 01:39:45,480
I'm like, this much closer to top 500.

2154
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:47,000
Guys, think about it.

2155
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:48,920
Guys, it's... Again.

2156
01:39:50,680 --> 01:39:54,020
Just think about how much closer I am.

2157
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:56,780
I'm just this much closer.

2158
01:39:57,500 --> 01:39:58,100
Look.

2159
01:39:58,380 --> 01:39:59,500
Okay, I'm right here.

2160
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:04,420
And like... It's right there.

2161
01:40:04,640 --> 01:40:08,940
It's literally... Wait, it's actually only... Wait, really?

2162
01:40:08,940 --> 01:40:09,020
Wait, really?

2163
01:40:10,700 --> 01:40:13,220
It's actually... Holy shit.

2164
01:40:13,900 --> 01:40:15,680
It's that high?

2165
01:40:15,860 --> 01:40:21,700
It's like, not even... Wait, it's... It's been in Celestia 2 for so fucking long.

2166
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:27,300
Like... This season has been so slow with the climb.

2167
01:40:31,240 --> 01:40:33,180
How is it still Celestia?

2168
01:40:33,380 --> 01:40:34,060
Oh, Jesus Christ.

2169
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:42,640
I really have not been... I've only been playing, like, on and off the last... Since the season started?

2170
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:44,920
I don't even know how many hours should I have.

2171
01:40:45,720 --> 01:40:47,980
I have...

2172
01:40:50,200 --> 01:40:56,750
Okay, nine... I have... Season 2.0.

2173
01:40:56,890 --> 01:40:58,310
I played 98 matches.

2174
01:40:58,310 --> 01:40:58,750
Okay.

2175
01:40:59,510 --> 01:41:07,650
I feel like this season is actually like... I feel like I personally... Yeah, I've only played... I played 98 matches.

2176
01:41:07,850 --> 01:41:09,530
I've done... I have 59 wins.

2177
01:41:09,530 --> 01:41:12,230
I have not been playing that much.

2178
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:16,960
Alright.

2179
01:41:17,620 --> 01:41:18,680
That's actually crazy.

2180
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:22,620
I feel like... I've only been, like, playing, like, every couple of days.

2181
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:27,980
Um... Or, like, Nightmare, like, once every couple of... Like... Maybe, like, a few times.

2182
01:41:28,780 --> 01:41:30,500
Oh my god, it's so climb up.

2183
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:32,060
It's so... It's almost there.

2184
01:41:32,640 --> 01:41:33,020
Okay.

2185
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:36,520
Okay.

2186
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:38,380
Okay, but, like... Off.

2187
01:41:42,900 --> 01:41:47,380
I could just... I could just climb right now.

2188
01:41:50,160 --> 01:41:52,660
Ooh, I could just do it right now.

2189
01:41:53,900 --> 01:41:54,780
Just right.

2190
01:41:58,360 --> 01:41:59,400
Not a bad wind rate.

2191
01:41:59,620 --> 01:42:00,580
Where's my wind rate right now?

2192
01:42:01,900 --> 01:42:02,980
Eh, it's alright.

2193
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:06,200
It's, like, not... I don't... This one's not good.

2194
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:07,200
This one's really good.

2195
01:42:07,580 --> 01:42:09,880
We don't talk about... We... This... This is, like, all in quick play.

2196
01:42:10,520 --> 01:42:10,920
Um...

2197
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:15,020
My studio has a better wind rate.

2198
01:42:16,940 --> 01:42:18,140
We don't talk about low-key.

2199
01:42:18,680 --> 01:42:19,560
You wanna know why we don't talk?

2200
01:42:19,640 --> 01:42:19,840
Okay.

2201
01:42:21,480 --> 01:42:21,880
Okay.

2202
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:25,280
I go low-key when I'm getting dived.

2203
01:42:25,980 --> 01:42:26,780
So, like...

2204
01:42:27,240 --> 01:42:29,280
You might be wondering, how bad is it?

2205
01:42:31,820 --> 01:42:32,300
How...

2206
01:42:32,300 --> 01:42:32,680
How...

2207
01:42:32,680 --> 01:42:33,460
So, you'd be like...

2208
01:42:33,460 --> 01:42:34,420
How bad is it?

2209
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:35,960
Wait, let me see how bad is it.

2210
01:42:38,380 --> 01:42:38,760
I...

2211
01:42:39,460 --> 01:42:39,940
So...

2212
01:42:39,940 --> 01:42:42,020
I only play low-key when...

2213
01:42:42,600 --> 01:42:43,920
I only play low-key when...

2214
01:42:44,260 --> 01:42:45,540
When I'm getting dived.

2215
01:42:45,980 --> 01:42:46,740
So, like...

2216
01:42:51,220 --> 01:42:52,740
Wait, is this in competitive?

2217
01:42:55,880 --> 01:42:57,480
Yeah, yeah, that sounds right.

2218
01:42:57,720 --> 01:42:58,740
That sounds right.

2219
01:42:59,820 --> 01:43:02,400
I've only won one game on low-key.

2220
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:04,940
That's how bad it is.

2221
01:43:06,520 --> 01:43:07,460
Why are you hiding?

2222
01:43:07,460 --> 01:43:07,920
Because...

2223
01:43:08,110 --> 01:43:09,480
Before today...

2224
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:10,180
It was...

2225
01:43:10,180 --> 01:43:11,460
Zero wins.

2226
01:43:11,800 --> 01:43:12,550
Before today...

2227
01:43:13,140 --> 01:43:14,900
It was four matches played.

2228
01:43:15,060 --> 01:43:15,940
Zero wins.

2229
01:43:16,220 --> 01:43:17,140
But today...

2230
01:43:17,140 --> 01:43:18,960
We finally did it, guys.

2231
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:20,620
We finally...

2232
01:43:20,620 --> 01:43:23,900
We finally won our first low-key game.

2233
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:25,940
Look at us go.

2234
01:43:26,620 --> 01:43:29,640
Yeah, she...

2235
01:43:31,290 --> 01:43:31,980
Let's go.

2236
01:43:36,120 --> 01:43:38,200
Today was that day.

2237
01:43:39,220 --> 01:43:42,380
We finally broke the streak, guys.

2238
01:43:42,700 --> 01:43:43,580
We made...

2239
01:43:43,580 --> 01:43:44,740
We did it.

2240
01:43:44,920 --> 01:43:47,260
We won our first low-key game today.

2241
01:43:50,040 --> 01:43:51,440
Cut on stream.

2242
01:43:53,300 --> 01:43:55,400
Mantis just not meta unless it's triple support.

2243
01:43:55,600 --> 01:43:56,120
Also, I'll be right back.

2244
01:43:56,140 --> 01:43:56,700
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

2245
01:44:58,650 --> 01:44:59,470
I did it!

2246
01:44:59,470 --> 01:45:01,070
I played long enough...

2247
01:45:01,070 --> 01:45:03,030
That it's EU hours now.

2248
01:45:05,550 --> 01:45:07,310
I've done it, guys.

2249
01:45:08,390 --> 01:45:10,690
I played long enough...

2250
01:45:10,690 --> 01:45:12,870
That I have EU players online.

2251
01:45:15,330 --> 01:45:17,090
My second win has hit.

2252
01:45:19,510 --> 01:45:20,750
I did it.

2253
01:45:24,950 --> 01:45:26,510
Okay, this is...

2254
01:45:26,510 --> 01:45:27,310
A little awkward.

2255
01:45:28,250 --> 01:45:28,990
Is this Pearl?

2256
01:45:32,010 --> 01:45:33,090
Oh my god.

2257
01:45:36,330 --> 01:45:36,830
You're right.

2258
01:45:37,430 --> 01:45:38,050
Second win.

2259
01:45:38,250 --> 01:45:39,090
How foolish of me.

2260
01:45:39,250 --> 01:45:40,770
It's the third win now.

2261
01:45:43,110 --> 01:45:44,570
Fistful, thank you for the hundred biddies.

2262
01:45:44,750 --> 01:45:45,670
Thank you, thank you.

2263
01:45:46,950 --> 01:45:48,250
Why didn't you say you weren't gonna grind, right?

2264
01:45:48,410 --> 01:45:48,670
This is...

2265
01:45:48,670 --> 01:45:49,790
This is my first grind!

2266
01:45:49,790 --> 01:45:51,650
If it's Banda, go ahead.

2267
01:45:51,850 --> 01:45:51,910
Wait.

2268
01:45:52,170 --> 01:45:52,770
If it's Banda, go ahead.

2269
01:45:52,770 --> 01:45:54,550
This is literally my first grind!

2270
01:45:56,350 --> 01:45:56,950
I...

2271
01:45:56,950 --> 01:45:58,750
I was a good boy...

2272
01:45:58,750 --> 01:46:00,070
For this whole season.

2273
01:46:01,210 --> 01:46:03,170
This was my first grind of the season.

2274
01:46:11,050 --> 01:46:12,970
Rush only good at it.

2275
01:46:13,590 --> 01:46:14,490
What the fuck?

2276
01:46:14,690 --> 01:46:14,950
Oh, wait.

2277
01:46:15,090 --> 01:46:16,250
Is that...

2278
01:46:16,770 --> 01:46:17,750
Is that Pearl?

2279
01:46:17,750 --> 01:46:19,310
Pick your hero.

2280
01:46:19,710 --> 01:46:20,390
Or villain.

2281
01:46:20,670 --> 01:46:21,170
I'm not judging you.

2282
01:46:21,170 --> 01:46:21,750
Oh my god!

2283
01:46:21,930 --> 01:46:23,950
We didn't ban Torch!

2284
01:46:25,850 --> 01:46:26,570
Alright.

2285
01:46:27,310 --> 01:46:28,170
It's Torch time.

2286
01:46:32,830 --> 01:46:34,270
It's Torch time.

2287
01:46:34,650 --> 01:46:36,890
We didn't ban Torch.

2288
01:46:45,830 --> 01:46:47,110
Yeah, we have Melania on Torch.

2289
01:46:47,230 --> 01:46:48,210
But I don't know who's gonna be at...

2290
01:46:48,210 --> 01:46:49,450
It's on streamer mode.

2291
01:46:49,610 --> 01:46:50,250
So I don't know who...

2292
01:46:50,250 --> 01:46:51,490
It could be anybody on the enemy team.

2293
01:46:55,630 --> 01:46:56,770
The thing is...

2294
01:46:56,770 --> 01:46:58,430
We don't know who's on the enemy team right now.

2295
01:46:58,890 --> 01:46:59,810
Because of streamer mode.

2296
01:47:01,590 --> 01:47:03,030
And there's Rush as well.

2297
01:47:03,170 --> 01:47:04,710
Rush is like a Psylocke player.

2298
01:47:10,040 --> 01:47:12,040
Rush really is a Psylocke.

2299
01:47:12,040 --> 01:47:14,440
Oh, you are such a huge star to the Badoon.

2300
01:47:14,720 --> 01:47:15,380
I am?

2301
01:47:17,460 --> 01:47:18,560
I didn't think aliens...

2302
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:19,620
We don't have Psylocke.

2303
01:47:19,900 --> 01:47:22,700
Oh, but we got...

2304
01:47:22,700 --> 01:47:23,780
Yeah, no, Psylocke is scary.

2305
01:47:23,860 --> 01:47:24,940
No, Psylocke is scary too.

2306
01:47:25,200 --> 01:47:27,860
But the fact that we did not ban Torch is...

2307
01:47:28,700 --> 01:47:30,340
Is even scarier.

2308
01:47:34,980 --> 01:47:36,340
I should be like...

2309
01:47:36,340 --> 01:47:38,140
You up first.

2310
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:39,660
I'll say that.

2311
01:47:39,820 --> 01:47:40,640
I always say that.

2312
01:47:40,760 --> 01:47:42,000
Because sometimes I just don't want to talk.

2313
01:47:42,160 --> 01:47:42,840
I've been doing...

2314
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:45,720
There goes one of them...

2315
01:47:46,060 --> 01:47:47,600
There goes one of them...

2316
01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:48,820
Oh, my god!

2317
01:47:49,060 --> 01:47:49,780
I hate this!

2318
01:47:50,300 --> 01:47:51,540
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

2319
01:47:52,240 --> 01:47:53,700
A lot of enemy is pretty slow.

2320
01:47:54,120 --> 01:47:54,740
This is hard.

2321
01:47:55,300 --> 01:47:55,820
That's a point.

2322
01:47:57,020 --> 01:47:57,060
That's much better.

2323
01:47:57,280 --> 01:47:58,500
Oh, my god.

2324
01:47:59,640 --> 01:48:00,960
I'll put it on...

2325
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:01,240
Well, it's over here.

2326
01:48:01,460 --> 01:48:01,680
Okay?

2327
01:48:02,260 --> 01:48:03,140
Lydon, I'm sorry.

2328
01:48:03,500 --> 01:48:05,420
But you're just gonna have to kill with a shield.

2329
01:48:09,910 --> 01:48:10,970
Oh, my God!

2330
01:48:11,090 --> 01:48:12,490
Oh, I'm going low key.

2331
01:48:12,710 --> 01:48:13,950
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

2332
01:48:14,670 --> 01:48:15,510
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

2333
01:48:15,510 --> 01:48:18,190
I'm more Loki now.

2334
01:48:19,290 --> 01:48:20,110
I'm...

2335
01:48:20,110 --> 01:48:22,290
No more.

2336
01:48:23,690 --> 01:48:27,450
They have Captain America, it's Loki time.

2337
01:48:30,230 --> 01:48:32,130
Oh, fuck, okay.

2338
01:48:33,490 --> 01:48:36,250
Okay, okay, I can heal both flyers.

2339
01:48:40,550 --> 01:48:42,870
I had to think about it.

2340
01:48:43,150 --> 01:48:44,190
I can do it.

2341
01:48:45,770 --> 01:48:48,970
In my head, I had to think about it a little bit.

2342
01:48:49,510 --> 01:48:51,530
I was like, can I actually do it?

2343
01:48:51,950 --> 01:48:52,930
Can I...

2344
01:48:54,890 --> 01:48:56,050
I can do it.

2345
01:48:56,170 --> 01:48:56,970
It's possible.

2346
01:49:00,490 --> 01:49:02,530
If there's a will, there's a way.

2347
01:49:08,260 --> 01:49:09,060
There you go.

2348
01:49:10,120 --> 01:49:11,020
I do this for you.

2349
01:49:12,700 --> 01:49:13,900
Oh my god.

2350
01:49:19,660 --> 01:49:22,580
I had to like, think about it for a second, like, in my head.

2351
01:49:22,700 --> 01:49:25,840
I was like, is this something I'm willing to do?

2352
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:28,770
This is real firepower.

2353
01:49:29,500 --> 01:49:30,180
This is not fair.

2354
01:49:33,680 --> 01:49:34,980
This is not fair.

2355
01:49:35,240 --> 01:49:36,560
This is...

2356
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:38,540
This is actually...

2357
01:49:38,540 --> 01:49:40,120
Oh my god.

2358
01:49:41,020 --> 01:49:41,460
Please.

2359
01:49:46,640 --> 01:49:48,000
Just in case.

2360
01:49:51,060 --> 01:49:52,180
Oh my god.

2361
01:49:54,060 --> 01:49:55,800
Oh my god.

2362
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,020
Oh my god.

2363
01:49:58,240 --> 01:49:58,860
What's going on?

2364
01:49:59,420 --> 01:50:00,720
What's going on?

2365
01:50:02,520 --> 01:50:03,800
Oh my god.

2366
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:07,460
I'm sorry.

2367
01:50:08,220 --> 01:50:10,120
But what the fuck is going on?

2368
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:13,160
Oh my god.

2369
01:50:16,420 --> 01:50:17,120
Okay.

2370
01:50:18,920 --> 01:50:19,860
That's fine.

2371
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:21,000
It's fine.

2372
01:50:22,440 --> 01:50:24,460
Nothing keeps me down for long.

2373
01:50:26,280 --> 01:50:28,000
This is Captain America.

2374
01:50:28,630 --> 01:50:29,580
Oh, thank god.

2375
01:50:29,800 --> 01:50:31,080
I fucking knew it's Pearl.

2376
01:50:31,280 --> 01:50:32,640
I knew it.

2377
01:50:32,640 --> 01:50:36,620
I fucking knew it was Pearl.

2378
01:50:40,570 --> 01:50:41,890
I was like, who...

2379
01:50:42,910 --> 01:50:45,610
Who else could it be that would insta-lock?

2380
01:50:47,710 --> 01:50:51,310
That would insta-lock fucking Widow right there.

2381
01:50:53,270 --> 01:50:54,870
Jesus Christ, I have to do that.

2382
01:50:54,870 --> 01:50:55,930
I hate that.

2383
01:50:56,030 --> 01:50:56,350
I hate that.

2384
01:50:56,430 --> 01:50:57,230
I have to use my...

2385
01:50:57,230 --> 01:50:57,830
lamb.

2386
01:51:00,610 --> 01:51:03,150
This is real firepower!

2387
01:51:07,870 --> 01:51:08,390
No!

2388
01:51:08,790 --> 01:51:10,890
I tried to DP somewhere!

2389
01:51:12,130 --> 01:51:12,850
It's fine.

2390
01:51:13,570 --> 01:51:14,350
It's fine.

2391
01:51:14,890 --> 01:51:15,410
It's fine.

2392
01:51:15,410 --> 01:51:15,710
It's fine.

2393
01:51:15,870 --> 01:51:16,350
We have...

2394
01:51:17,030 --> 01:51:17,830
Our Lunar...

2395
01:51:17,830 --> 01:51:18,510
It's not fine.

2396
01:51:18,610 --> 01:51:19,430
Our Lunar did not live.

2397
01:51:21,070 --> 01:51:22,010
It's not fine.

2398
01:51:22,070 --> 01:51:22,970
Our Lunar did not live.

2399
01:51:23,130 --> 01:51:24,950
They went fucking Bucky?!

2400
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:31,780
He's unlucky.

2401
01:51:31,780 --> 01:51:40,050
I thought... Oh no.

2402
01:51:40,690 --> 01:51:41,070
No!

2403
01:51:44,970 --> 01:51:47,750
Guys, it might not be fine.

2404
01:51:48,290 --> 01:51:50,350
I... No, I'm in NA!

2405
01:51:50,730 --> 01:51:51,810
I'm still in NA!

2406
01:51:52,270 --> 01:51:53,370
Which is cute.

2407
01:51:53,570 --> 01:51:55,590
I'm just cute on EU player right now.

2408
01:52:00,070 --> 01:52:00,750
What?

2409
01:52:01,510 --> 01:52:02,710
We swap roles?

2410
01:52:03,450 --> 01:52:04,790
Dude, me and the Luna?

2411
01:52:04,970 --> 01:52:07,450
I play Sue, and then she plays Luna?

2412
01:52:13,320 --> 01:52:16,160
Like... I don't know.

2413
01:52:17,040 --> 01:52:18,920
I don't... Okay, but they do have Bucky.

2414
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:23,700
I am Loki, god of mischief, and the king of Asgard.

2415
01:52:24,280 --> 01:52:24,940
Okay.

2416
01:52:26,540 --> 01:52:27,220
Alright.

2417
01:52:27,220 --> 01:52:27,380
Alright.

2418
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:31,340
We'll do this again.

2419
01:52:31,600 --> 01:52:32,380
We swapped roles.

2420
01:52:33,460 --> 01:52:36,500
He swapped the Bucky, so I have to swap anyway.

2421
01:52:41,620 --> 01:52:42,720
It's just unfortunate.

2422
01:52:44,300 --> 01:52:47,400
I just think we have... We only have one tank there.

2423
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:51,920
It's okay, guys.

2424
01:52:52,160 --> 01:52:53,140
I might not lose a lot.

2425
01:52:53,900 --> 01:52:55,800
That's my, like...

2426
01:52:55,800 --> 01:52:58,300
It's okay, if I drop back to Celestia...

2427
01:52:58,300 --> 01:53:00,760
If I drop back to Celestia 3...

2428
01:53:00,760 --> 01:53:02,000
That means, guys...

2429
01:53:02,980 --> 01:53:04,740
I get to play a little longer.

2430
01:53:05,160 --> 01:53:06,320
Ha ha ha ha!

2431
01:53:09,880 --> 01:53:10,940
That's the best part.

2432
01:53:13,600 --> 01:53:15,360
Means I get to play a little longer.

2433
01:53:15,360 --> 01:53:15,420
Okay.

2434
01:53:18,680 --> 01:53:19,700
Is that great?

2435
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:25,740
Oh, my God.

2436
01:53:25,860 --> 01:53:26,560
Where is she?

2437
01:53:28,120 --> 01:53:29,240
Oh, my God.

2438
01:53:38,340 --> 01:53:39,320
Oh, my God.

2439
01:53:39,480 --> 01:53:39,800
Please.

2440
01:53:45,570 --> 01:53:46,170
Please.

2441
01:53:47,210 --> 01:53:47,650
Please!

2442
01:53:48,610 --> 01:53:49,370
I'm fat!

2443
01:53:49,530 --> 01:53:50,050
I'm...

2444
01:53:50,770 --> 01:53:51,710
Oh, my God!

2445
01:53:51,770 --> 01:53:52,090
Please!

2446
01:53:52,270 --> 01:53:52,670
Let me...

2447
01:53:56,820 --> 01:53:58,400
Oh, my God.

2448
01:53:58,500 --> 01:53:59,220
I got kicked out.

2449
01:53:59,440 --> 01:54:00,900
They almost kicked me up.

2450
01:54:01,060 --> 01:54:03,200
They almost evicted me out of my home.

2451
01:54:03,460 --> 01:54:04,580
They almost...

2452
01:54:04,580 --> 01:54:06,320
I almost got evicted.

2453
01:54:06,540 --> 01:54:09,300
I almost got evicted from the house I built.

2454
01:54:09,900 --> 01:54:10,380
Ha ha ha.

2455
01:54:13,080 --> 01:54:13,940
That was crazy.

2456
01:54:15,160 --> 01:54:17,980
They actually almost tried to kick me out of my home.

2457
01:54:18,160 --> 01:54:19,520
I built that home.

2458
01:54:22,140 --> 01:54:23,920
I built that home myself!

2459
01:54:24,520 --> 01:54:26,160
How could they do that to me?

2460
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:28,880
Jesus.

2461
01:54:29,920 --> 01:54:30,480
Please.

2462
01:54:31,120 --> 01:54:31,660
Oh, my God.

2463
01:54:31,960 --> 01:54:32,780
We're so fucked.

2464
01:54:33,020 --> 01:54:34,380
We're so fucked.

2465
01:54:34,380 --> 01:54:34,880
I'm sorry.

2466
01:54:38,160 --> 01:54:39,220
Oh, my God.

2467
01:54:44,280 --> 01:54:45,720
Oh, my God.

2468
01:54:50,830 --> 01:54:51,890
Don't worry Lula.

2469
01:54:52,190 --> 01:54:53,370
We will live.

2470
01:54:54,790 --> 01:54:56,430
I'm trying my best!

2471
01:54:57,090 --> 01:54:57,330
Luna!

2472
01:54:57,790 --> 01:54:59,310
I really am!

2473
01:55:02,170 --> 01:55:03,790
Oh, my God!

2474
01:55:04,890 --> 01:55:06,510
Yeah, Captain is the landlord.

2475
01:55:08,230 --> 01:55:09,450
He's the landlord.

2476
01:55:09,730 --> 01:55:10,830
He's like, it's time.

2477
01:55:11,310 --> 01:55:11,950
Wow.

2478
01:55:13,970 --> 01:55:15,750
Yeah, it's a good thing we swapped roles.

2479
01:55:16,050 --> 01:55:17,110
We swapped characters.

2480
01:55:26,730 --> 01:55:27,430
Oh god.

2481
01:55:29,510 --> 01:55:31,090
I'm like so stressed out right now.

2482
01:55:31,630 --> 01:55:33,310
I'm so stressed out.

2483
01:55:38,570 --> 01:55:39,310
Don't worry.

2484
01:55:42,370 --> 01:55:43,170
It's okay.

2485
01:55:43,850 --> 01:55:46,970
Stand in my home that I've made for us!

2486
01:55:48,590 --> 01:55:50,050
Oh, he was so low, too.

2487
01:55:56,090 --> 01:55:56,770
Don't worry!

2488
01:55:57,950 --> 01:55:59,370
Oh my god, start worrying.

2489
01:56:04,710 --> 01:56:06,850
Oh no, start maybe worrying a little bit.

2490
01:56:07,190 --> 01:56:07,430
Yep.

2491
01:56:08,290 --> 01:56:09,250
Start worrying!

2492
01:56:11,030 --> 01:56:13,190
Support, support each other.

2493
01:56:14,650 --> 01:56:15,910
I don't have luna, I think.

2494
01:56:16,830 --> 01:56:20,170
I don't play Loki as much.

2495
01:56:20,170 --> 01:56:21,970
I only play Loki when I'm getting dived.

2496
01:56:23,070 --> 01:56:23,890
And like...

2497
01:56:25,930 --> 01:56:29,230
Literally like, that's like the only reason why I play Loki.

2498
01:56:31,310 --> 01:56:35,550
Loki is like... the skill ceiling for Loki is so high.

2499
01:56:35,910 --> 01:56:36,610
In general.

2500
01:56:42,330 --> 01:56:45,430
Loki takes a... Jesus Christ, okay.

2501
01:56:46,150 --> 01:56:47,010
That's cool.

2502
01:56:47,990 --> 01:56:49,510
I am ready to put on a show.

2503
01:56:49,570 --> 01:56:50,810
I think Loki... NOOOO!

2504
01:56:50,990 --> 01:56:51,930
That's good, I can't help it.

2505
01:56:54,990 --> 01:56:56,730
Loki in general takes a lot more.

2506
01:56:58,270 --> 01:56:59,390
Takes a lot more to learn.

2507
01:56:59,570 --> 01:57:01,210
Like, a lot more skill to learn.

2508
01:57:02,750 --> 01:57:07,750
And, um... I don't play Loki as much.

2509
01:57:08,050 --> 01:57:11,110
To like, be really good at him.

2510
01:57:12,430 --> 01:57:14,150
I'm good enough, you know?

2511
01:57:14,310 --> 01:57:17,170
Like, I do... I do enough.

2512
01:57:21,350 --> 01:57:22,670
Oh my, that sucks.

2513
01:57:27,770 --> 01:57:28,330
Okay.

2514
01:57:30,850 --> 01:57:32,270
Oh my... NOOOO!

2515
01:57:32,470 --> 01:57:33,190
I almost got him!

2516
01:57:34,170 --> 01:57:35,150
That's unlucky.

2517
01:57:40,360 --> 01:57:41,080
Don't worry.

2518
01:57:41,960 --> 01:57:42,480
I got us.

2519
01:57:43,120 --> 01:57:44,600
I don't got us no more.

2520
01:57:48,040 --> 01:57:49,840
I don't got us no more.

2521
01:57:50,080 --> 01:57:50,280
I don't got us no more.

2522
01:57:57,910 --> 01:57:59,530
I don't got us no more.

2523
01:58:00,910 --> 01:58:01,610
Oh!

2524
01:58:02,250 --> 01:58:02,950
No!

2525
01:58:03,430 --> 01:58:03,850
No!

2526
01:58:05,710 --> 01:58:06,060
Why?!

2527
01:58:09,430 --> 01:58:10,750
I need to know!

2528
01:58:12,090 --> 01:58:12,790
Why?!

2529
01:58:14,470 --> 01:58:15,170
Why?!

2530
01:58:15,170 --> 01:58:17,860
Why did she run away from me?!

2531
01:58:20,180 --> 01:58:21,980
Oh wait, let's see it...

2532
01:58:21,980 --> 01:58:22,860
Why?!

2533
01:58:23,660 --> 01:58:24,940
Oh, hello guy.

2534
01:58:25,260 --> 01:58:25,660
You're bent.

2535
01:58:26,320 --> 01:58:27,020
Send me something.

2536
01:58:28,220 --> 01:58:30,860
How did I get pushed away?!

2537
01:58:34,180 --> 01:58:36,920
I got... I got pushed...

2538
01:58:37,840 --> 01:58:39,480
Two times!

2539
01:58:40,080 --> 01:58:42,840
They pushed me away twice!

2540
01:58:44,260 --> 01:58:46,080
That's fucking crazy.

2541
01:58:47,660 --> 01:58:49,640
I literally got pushed away!

2542
01:58:49,960 --> 01:58:52,240
Oh wait, is my stadium head still going?

2543
01:58:52,360 --> 01:58:53,560
Okay, wait, I turned it off.

2544
01:58:54,540 --> 01:58:56,420
I got pushed away like...

2545
01:58:56,420 --> 01:58:57,860
Twice in a row!

2546
01:58:58,200 --> 01:58:59,260
From the Luna...

2547
01:58:59,260 --> 01:58:59,640
Oh, like, yay!

2548
01:58:59,820 --> 01:59:00,740
I don't lose anything!

2549
01:59:01,340 --> 01:59:02,640
Yeah, let's go!

2550
01:59:03,020 --> 01:59:03,980
Okay, let me log in.

2551
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:05,780
To my...

2552
01:59:05,780 --> 01:59:06,300
Nightbot.

2553
01:59:09,770 --> 01:59:11,430
I was just like...

2554
01:59:11,430 --> 01:59:12,450
What do I do?

2555
01:59:12,830 --> 01:59:13,670
What am I...

2556
01:59:16,330 --> 01:59:17,450
Oh, you got turned...

2557
01:59:17,450 --> 01:59:17,930
Oh, you turned off.

2558
01:59:18,050 --> 01:59:18,530
Thank you.

2559
01:59:18,850 --> 01:59:20,310
Thank you for turning off, mod.

2560
01:59:21,670 --> 01:59:23,090
I realize it's still on.

2561
01:59:26,600 --> 01:59:27,560
Wait, am I leader?

2562
01:59:27,860 --> 01:59:28,160
Oh.

2563
01:59:28,920 --> 01:59:30,080
I don't like being leader.

2564
01:59:30,700 --> 01:59:31,820
It's not cool.

2565
01:59:34,420 --> 01:59:34,940
Wait.

2566
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:40,440
Your leader.

2567
01:59:41,780 --> 01:59:43,620
Okay, I don't like to lead.

2568
01:59:44,580 --> 01:59:45,820
Who's Messiah?

2569
01:59:49,780 --> 01:59:50,920
Who's this guy?

2570
01:59:51,380 --> 01:59:52,600
I keep bumping into him.

2571
01:59:57,280 --> 01:59:58,240
It's okay.

2572
02:00:01,540 --> 02:00:01,940
Okay.

2573
02:00:01,940 --> 02:00:02,000
See?

2574
02:00:02,400 --> 02:00:03,280
That's the difference.

2575
02:00:03,960 --> 02:00:05,240
Okay, so you see how...

2576
02:00:08,380 --> 02:00:10,240
So you see how like...

2577
02:00:11,080 --> 02:00:11,480
Uh...

2578
02:00:12,280 --> 02:00:12,680
Uh...

2579
02:00:12,680 --> 02:00:13,540
What is it?

2580
02:00:13,640 --> 02:00:16,660
You see how like, you know, when we were in that GM game earlier...

2581
02:00:16,660 --> 02:00:18,180
Oh, I'm ranked 894?

2582
02:00:18,840 --> 02:00:19,820
That's fucking good.

2583
02:00:19,880 --> 02:00:20,440
Oh, I was...

2584
02:00:20,440 --> 02:00:21,480
I must have been higher before.

2585
02:00:22,140 --> 02:00:22,540
No!

2586
02:00:22,720 --> 02:00:23,580
I was so close!

2587
02:00:24,760 --> 02:00:26,520
Guys, I'm top 1000 in the world.

2588
02:00:26,520 --> 02:00:27,240
Yeah.

2589
02:00:29,360 --> 02:00:30,760
That's still pretty cool.

2590
02:00:33,320 --> 02:00:34,400
Top 1000?

2591
02:00:34,880 --> 02:00:36,160
That's pretty cool.

2592
02:00:36,600 --> 02:00:38,220
Oh, that means I could have been higher.

2593
02:00:38,680 --> 02:00:39,160
Oh my God.

2594
02:00:39,240 --> 02:00:40,180
What was I before?

2595
02:00:41,020 --> 02:00:42,180
God, I didn't look.

2596
02:00:42,440 --> 02:00:43,560
What was I before?

2597
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:49,520
Before I played that match.

2598
02:00:49,680 --> 02:00:49,960
Thank you.

2599
02:00:50,100 --> 02:00:50,540
Please clap.

2600
02:00:51,160 --> 02:00:52,280
Please clap, guys.

2601
02:00:57,480 --> 02:00:59,440
I guess we'll never know.

2602
02:00:59,580 --> 02:01:00,100
You're right.

2603
02:01:00,260 --> 02:01:00,940
It could have been 501.

2604
02:01:03,120 --> 02:01:04,500
Fistful, thank you for the 100 biddies.

2605
02:01:04,660 --> 02:01:05,540
Thank you, thank you.

2606
02:01:05,720 --> 02:01:07,460
I don't think I'm starting to stick around for this long.

2607
02:01:07,600 --> 02:01:09,360
I'm tapping out things for a long day of dokie streams.

2608
02:01:09,460 --> 02:01:10,840
I hope you have top 500, thank you.

2609
02:01:11,100 --> 02:01:12,140
I really appreciate it.

2610
02:01:12,160 --> 02:01:13,060
Thank you for the super chat.

2611
02:01:13,240 --> 02:01:17,200
Thank you for the bitties.

2612
02:01:17,420 --> 02:01:18,360
Thank you, thank you.

2613
02:01:18,360 --> 02:01:19,980
Oh, I really appreciate it.

2614
02:01:21,880 --> 02:01:23,160
What was I talking about?

2615
02:01:24,080 --> 02:01:24,580
Oh, yeah.

2616
02:01:24,940 --> 02:01:29,660
So, like, you guys saw how, like, bad the enemy team was diving in GM lobbies?

2617
02:01:30,220 --> 02:01:37,120
Like, now look at how one Captain America literally stopped our entire team.

2618
02:01:39,740 --> 02:01:44,160
This guy literally stopped.

2619
02:01:47,760 --> 02:01:51,820
Literally, it stopped, like, like, both of us.

2620
02:01:52,120 --> 02:01:54,220
Like, both supports from doing anything.

2621
02:02:00,550 --> 02:02:03,270
Look, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

2622
02:02:03,410 --> 02:02:04,210
Thank you, thank you.

2623
02:02:04,450 --> 02:02:05,950
One Captain America.

2624
02:02:14,350 --> 02:02:15,930
No, he was just targeting both supports.

2625
02:02:15,930 --> 02:02:16,510
That's what he does.

2626
02:02:16,510 --> 02:02:19,530
Captain America meta is, like, so fucking dumb.

2627
02:02:20,670 --> 02:02:22,010
Also, Marco, thank you for the hundred bitties.

2628
02:02:22,130 --> 02:02:22,870
Thank you, thank you.

2629
02:02:24,130 --> 02:02:26,790
Uh, when are we getting the support climb to GMSD?

2630
02:02:27,090 --> 02:02:27,990
Fucking hell no.

2631
02:02:30,310 --> 02:02:31,130
That's... I don't know.

2632
02:02:33,010 --> 02:02:34,130
That's... I don't know.

2633
02:02:34,350 --> 02:02:36,190
I'm not, like, too...

2634
02:02:41,290 --> 02:02:41,810
Uh...

2635
02:02:42,830 --> 02:02:43,790
What's the word?

2636
02:02:44,370 --> 02:02:46,710
Not too hype about stuff, something like that.

2637
02:02:49,910 --> 02:02:53,110
That's not something I'm, like, too hype for.

2638
02:02:53,370 --> 02:02:58,670
Just cause, like, I'm not that great at DPS and hero shooters, cause I don't play DPS and hero shooters.

2639
02:02:59,110 --> 02:03:03,810
But, like, GM is not that hard to get to, I feel like.

2640
02:03:04,990 --> 02:03:05,550
Uh...

2641
02:03:05,550 --> 02:03:08,030
I don't know if I'm... I'm not strong enough to solo queue.

2642
02:03:09,430 --> 02:03:11,050
I'm just thinking, I'm like...

2643
02:03:11,450 --> 02:03:13,530
Am I strong enough to solo queue?

2644
02:03:15,070 --> 02:03:15,630
Like...

2645
02:03:15,630 --> 02:03:16,810
Here we do...

2646
02:03:17,530 --> 02:03:19,150
Here we do trip support.

2647
02:03:19,710 --> 02:03:21,110
We could run...

2648
02:03:22,290 --> 02:03:22,850
Mantis.

2649
02:03:28,530 --> 02:03:29,690
I'll go Mantis.

2650
02:03:29,850 --> 02:03:29,970
I'll go Mantis.

2651
02:03:29,970 --> 02:03:30,870
Fuck yeah, I'll go Mantis.

2652
02:03:32,330 --> 02:03:34,110
We could run trip support.

2653
02:03:36,290 --> 02:03:37,470
We're gonna run...

2654
02:03:37,470 --> 02:03:39,790
Yeah, we might as well run Mantis with trip support.

2655
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:45,040
Oh, actually...

2656
02:03:45,040 --> 02:03:45,880
Adam will be better.

2657
02:03:46,420 --> 02:03:47,600
I wanna go Adam here.

2658
02:03:48,620 --> 02:03:49,140
Actually...

2659
02:03:49,680 --> 02:03:50,920
Okay, I'll go Adam.

2660
02:03:52,080 --> 02:03:53,120
You can do it.

2661
02:03:53,380 --> 02:03:54,220
Trip support time!

2662
02:03:54,220 --> 02:03:54,780
Let's go!

2663
02:03:57,720 --> 02:03:58,820
I was gonna say...

2664
02:04:00,640 --> 02:04:02,240
I don't think I can...

2665
02:04:02,240 --> 02:04:05,220
I don't think I can do a...

2666
02:04:05,600 --> 02:04:07,580
I don't think I can do a...

2667
02:04:07,580 --> 02:04:11,060
Solo queue DPS just cause I'm not strong enough as a person.

2668
02:04:11,600 --> 02:04:12,600
I... I...

2669
02:04:12,600 --> 02:04:14,980
I know I'm not strong enough for that.

2670
02:04:22,200 --> 02:04:24,500
Alright, let's go.

2671
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:25,460
Trip support!

2672
02:04:27,140 --> 02:04:28,560
It's just like the tournament.

2673
02:04:29,200 --> 02:04:30,580
Oh, I don't wanna heal this.

2674
02:04:30,740 --> 02:04:31,820
Someone healer held up.

2675
02:04:34,420 --> 02:04:35,400
Are you serious?

2676
02:04:35,680 --> 02:04:36,380
Oh my god.

2677
02:04:36,740 --> 02:04:37,700
I thought...

2678
02:04:37,700 --> 02:04:38,280
You know...

2679
02:04:38,280 --> 02:04:40,400
The rest of my team will try to heal us.

2680
02:04:41,860 --> 02:04:42,500
Can you bubble me?

2681
02:04:43,960 --> 02:04:44,820
Okay, nice.

2682
02:04:49,500 --> 02:04:51,140
Oh, that's unlucky for them.

2683
02:04:54,720 --> 02:04:55,380
Alright.

2684
02:04:56,340 --> 02:04:57,460
That's not great.

2685
02:04:59,080 --> 02:05:00,760
I'm just gonna wait a little bit.

2686
02:05:01,860 --> 02:05:03,180
And then...

2687
02:05:03,180 --> 02:05:04,920
I don't wanna waste my snaps too.

2688
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:05,340
Woah!

2689
02:05:05,660 --> 02:05:06,860
He was almost dead!

2690
02:05:10,430 --> 02:05:11,090
Alright.

2691
02:05:11,330 --> 02:05:12,170
Oh, he's fine.

2692
02:05:12,610 --> 02:05:13,430
He's so healthy.

2693
02:05:18,310 --> 02:05:18,970
Okay.

2694
02:05:21,410 --> 02:05:22,070
Wait.

2695
02:05:24,150 --> 02:05:24,890
No!

2696
02:05:24,950 --> 02:05:27,010
I can't get to you in time!

2697
02:05:27,790 --> 02:05:30,510
I had to use that just cause...

2698
02:05:30,510 --> 02:05:31,910
I tried!

2699
02:05:34,570 --> 02:05:36,510
He might be...

2700
02:05:36,510 --> 02:05:37,410
Not okay.

2701
02:05:37,410 --> 02:05:38,750
Please break the wall.

2702
02:05:38,910 --> 02:05:40,030
Please break the wall.

2703
02:05:40,190 --> 02:05:40,210
Please break the wall.

2704
02:05:40,210 --> 02:05:40,970
Oh my god.

2705
02:05:44,210 --> 02:05:45,230
Okay, that's fine.

2706
02:05:48,110 --> 02:05:48,610
That's fine.

2707
02:05:51,630 --> 02:05:52,550
That's okay.

2708
02:05:53,450 --> 02:05:55,090
Cause I have ult soon.

2709
02:05:55,590 --> 02:05:56,470
I have ult.

2710
02:05:59,570 --> 02:06:00,730
Jesus Christ.

2711
02:06:04,710 --> 02:06:05,350
Alright.

2712
02:06:05,750 --> 02:06:06,070
Nice.

2713
02:06:13,050 --> 02:06:14,230
Get out of there.

2714
02:06:14,670 --> 02:06:15,130
Yay!

2715
02:06:15,970 --> 02:06:17,290
Now I just stay here.

2716
02:06:18,690 --> 02:06:19,330
Yippie!

2717
02:06:19,870 --> 02:06:20,770
How y'all live that?

2718
02:06:21,030 --> 02:06:22,230
Triple support baby!

2719
02:06:23,670 --> 02:06:26,450
Stupidest comp that can ever be made!

2720
02:06:26,890 --> 02:06:29,130
It reminds me of Goats!

2721
02:06:31,730 --> 02:06:35,210
A triple res is fundamentally really fucking broken.

2722
02:06:36,550 --> 02:06:38,570
It's just an incredibly...

2723
02:06:38,570 --> 02:06:39,870
Oh my god.

2724
02:06:40,230 --> 02:06:43,990
Okay, I... maybe should not have waited that long to heal him.

2725
02:06:46,970 --> 02:06:48,470
Oh my god, I have to use that.

2726
02:06:49,050 --> 02:06:51,410
I didn't want to, but...

2727
02:06:51,410 --> 02:06:58,290
Because I feel like using that, if I can't do anything about reses and stuff...

2728
02:07:01,250 --> 02:07:02,950
Yeah, thanks for the snaps, idiot.

2729
02:07:04,930 --> 02:07:07,750
Thanks for the free snaps, loser.

2730
02:07:09,730 --> 02:07:11,010
Get out of here.

2731
02:07:12,990 --> 02:07:14,690
That's right, losers.

2732
02:07:16,630 --> 02:07:20,400
I will heal you!

2733
02:07:21,240 --> 02:07:22,620
You shall live!

2734
02:07:23,560 --> 02:07:24,680
Oh my god.

2735
02:07:25,340 --> 02:07:25,960
Don't worry.

2736
02:07:26,640 --> 02:07:27,480
I got you.

2737
02:07:27,480 --> 02:07:29,200
Back up all that bravado, Quill.

2738
02:07:32,120 --> 02:07:33,560
Thanks for the...

2739
02:07:33,560 --> 02:07:35,000
Thanks for the snaps, losers.

2740
02:07:35,580 --> 02:07:36,300
That's right.

2741
02:07:39,400 --> 02:07:44,380
For those of you who want to know why I was like farming the low-key clone...

2742
02:07:44,380 --> 02:07:46,060
I... I learned this today.

2743
02:07:47,620 --> 02:07:48,960
Let's not let him play Adam.

2744
02:07:49,720 --> 02:07:50,480
Let's not let...

2745
02:07:50,480 --> 02:07:51,340
Um...

2746
02:07:51,920 --> 02:07:54,360
No, I play... I used to play Adam in Season 1, but...

2747
02:07:55,360 --> 02:07:56,660
And what is it, Season 0?

2748
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,140
Adam was so good at Season 0, but like...

2749
02:07:59,140 --> 02:08:01,280
In Season 1, he put...

2750
02:08:01,280 --> 02:08:02,700
He like, you know...

2751
02:08:02,700 --> 02:08:03,440
Kicked his...

2752
02:08:03,440 --> 02:08:03,820
Um...

2753
02:08:03,820 --> 02:08:05,080
They like amputated his legs.

2754
02:08:05,640 --> 02:08:06,120
So...

2755
02:08:08,120 --> 02:08:08,600
So...

2756
02:08:09,480 --> 02:08:09,960
Apparently...

2757
02:08:10,500 --> 02:08:13,600
I don't play a lot of Adam because of Season 2.

2758
02:08:13,900 --> 02:08:15,640
But in the new buff...

2759
02:08:16,540 --> 02:08:18,020
He's apparently a...

2760
02:08:18,020 --> 02:08:19,940
If you hit the headshot...

2761
02:08:19,940 --> 02:08:21,860
If you hit the headshot...

2762
02:08:21,860 --> 02:08:22,460
Uh...

2763
02:08:22,460 --> 02:08:23,920
Oh my god, you're so stupid.

2764
02:08:27,040 --> 02:08:29,980
If you hit headshot, you get your heals faster.

2765
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:35,380
He shall live.

2766
02:08:38,420 --> 02:08:40,020
Yeah, so he's not...

2767
02:08:40,020 --> 02:08:41,660
You know, they gave him new legs.

2768
02:08:42,620 --> 02:08:43,840
Okay, I don't have...

2769
02:08:45,020 --> 02:08:46,480
Only shit is I don't have.

2770
02:08:48,780 --> 02:08:49,300
Um...

2771
02:08:50,740 --> 02:08:52,050
Just need to make sure...

2772
02:08:53,140 --> 02:08:54,100
Everybody's okay.

2773
02:08:59,340 --> 02:09:00,940
Let's hope nobody...

2774
02:09:00,940 --> 02:09:01,340
Guys...

2775
02:09:04,720 --> 02:09:05,880
There goes...

2776
02:09:05,880 --> 02:09:06,140
Huge.

2777
02:09:07,180 --> 02:09:08,080
Guess not.

2778
02:09:12,760 --> 02:09:14,340
It's okay, I got...

2779
02:09:14,340 --> 02:09:15,260
I had res.

2780
02:09:15,420 --> 02:09:15,900
It's okay.

2781
02:09:16,340 --> 02:09:17,120
That's fine.

2782
02:09:18,440 --> 02:09:19,280
It's fine.

2783
02:09:19,540 --> 02:09:20,860
Like, that's a little awkward.

2784
02:09:21,740 --> 02:09:22,240
But...

2785
02:09:23,780 --> 02:09:25,580
But it's fine.

2786
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:25,860
Yeah.

2787
02:09:32,720 --> 02:09:33,760
I had res.

2788
02:09:34,180 --> 02:09:34,900
That's okay.

2789
02:09:35,900 --> 02:09:36,660
Yay!

2790
02:09:40,120 --> 02:09:42,520
Three, two, zero.

2791
02:09:43,940 --> 02:09:45,300
Time to switch things up.

2792
02:09:45,760 --> 02:09:46,960
Including which side...

2793
02:09:46,960 --> 02:09:48,720
Yes, we did it.

2794
02:09:50,140 --> 02:09:52,140
I will bring peace to this universe.

2795
02:09:52,140 --> 02:09:53,200
See, it's that easy.

2796
02:09:55,580 --> 02:09:57,520
We got legs again.

2797
02:10:00,900 --> 02:10:01,940
After the...

2798
02:10:01,940 --> 02:10:02,140
Yeah.

2799
02:10:02,600 --> 02:10:03,840
That's what buffs mean.

2800
02:10:04,120 --> 02:10:05,420
It's so working.

2801
02:10:05,580 --> 02:10:07,400
After the Adam Mantis bus.

2802
02:10:08,900 --> 02:10:09,980
That's what...

2803
02:10:09,980 --> 02:10:11,180
That's what buffs mean.

2804
02:10:11,320 --> 02:10:11,680
Of course.

2805
02:10:15,720 --> 02:10:17,280
I like how they asked that.

2806
02:10:17,460 --> 02:10:17,760
Oh, wait.

2807
02:10:17,900 --> 02:10:18,960
Is that blessed on you?

2808
02:10:19,140 --> 02:10:19,460
Oh, yeah.

2809
02:10:19,560 --> 02:10:19,880
It is.

2810
02:10:22,860 --> 02:10:23,900
That's what it means.

2811
02:10:29,320 --> 02:10:29,760
Wait.

2812
02:10:29,940 --> 02:10:31,720
The buff made the comp stronger?

2813
02:10:32,320 --> 02:10:33,780
He's a little confused.

2814
02:10:33,960 --> 02:10:34,380
You're right.

2815
02:10:34,380 --> 02:10:35,800
He's got spirit.

2816
02:10:36,180 --> 02:10:37,040
How about you?

2817
02:10:40,060 --> 02:10:40,620
Yeah.

2818
02:10:41,380 --> 02:10:44,660
I should have like a command where people be like, What's your rank now?

2819
02:10:44,760 --> 02:10:45,360
Or some shit.

2820
02:10:45,780 --> 02:10:46,840
Everyone keeps asking.

2821
02:10:49,280 --> 02:10:50,400
They're like...

2822
02:10:50,400 --> 02:10:52,560
To be fair, Celestia is sort of top five...

2823
02:10:53,080 --> 02:10:54,400
It's like borderline top.

2824
02:10:54,540 --> 02:10:56,780
It's like each Celestia is like borderline top 500.

2825
02:11:17,690 --> 02:11:21,830
I mean, just with the way people are playing, you sort of tell what ELO this is.

2826
02:11:25,730 --> 02:11:26,290
Don't worry.

2827
02:11:26,950 --> 02:11:27,530
I actually...

2828
02:11:27,530 --> 02:11:28,330
I'm worrying a little bit.

2829
02:11:28,330 --> 02:11:30,590
I'm a little fucked up right now.

2830
02:11:30,710 --> 02:11:31,990
Oh my god.

2831
02:11:32,430 --> 02:11:32,650
Rush.

2832
02:11:33,030 --> 02:11:34,250
You go, girl.

2833
02:11:37,110 --> 02:11:37,770
Come on.

2834
02:11:37,910 --> 02:11:39,350
You're really gonna let a Psy...

2835
02:11:39,350 --> 02:11:39,510
Wait.

2836
02:11:39,650 --> 02:11:40,490
They're both Psylocke one tricks.

2837
02:11:40,670 --> 02:11:40,750
Never.

2838
02:11:42,130 --> 02:11:47,430
I was gonna be like, You're really gonna let Psylocke one trick dip you.

2839
02:11:47,610 --> 02:11:48,790
But then I remembered.

2840
02:11:49,170 --> 02:11:50,730
They're both Psylocke one tricks.

2841
02:11:50,890 --> 02:11:51,870
They're no different.

2842
02:11:56,690 --> 02:11:57,630
It's true.

2843
02:11:58,330 --> 02:12:03,030
They're both known as really good Psylocke players.

2844
02:12:07,530 --> 02:12:08,390
Hello, actually.

2845
02:12:08,390 --> 02:12:11,670
I'm gonna do that just so I can...

2846
02:12:11,670 --> 02:12:14,990
What the fuck?!

2847
02:12:15,590 --> 02:12:17,030
Holy shit!

2848
02:12:18,230 --> 02:12:18,890
Yeah...

2849
02:12:19,450 --> 02:12:20,170
Nah.

2850
02:12:22,030 --> 02:12:24,770
I even soul-linked, too!

2851
02:12:26,230 --> 02:12:27,150
That's crazy.

2852
02:12:27,390 --> 02:12:28,650
I soul-linked that.

2853
02:12:33,720 --> 02:12:38,020
I was not expecting my team to get deleted that fast.

2854
02:12:41,740 --> 02:12:42,260
Jesus.

2855
02:12:44,680 --> 02:12:45,860
Oh my god, okay.

2856
02:12:50,760 --> 02:12:51,900
Oh my god, fuck!

2857
02:12:52,420 --> 02:12:55,200
I thought I had my soul-linked, but I counted incorrectly.

2858
02:12:56,540 --> 02:12:57,010
Sucks.

2859
02:13:00,880 --> 02:13:01,950
There you go.

2860
02:13:06,440 --> 02:13:07,670
That's unlucky, though.

2861
02:13:08,290 --> 02:13:09,680
I legit thought I had...

2862
02:13:12,700 --> 02:13:14,760
I don't know if...

2863
02:13:14,760 --> 02:13:14,920
I don't know if...

2864
02:13:14,920 --> 02:13:15,900
We used too many.

2865
02:13:16,060 --> 02:13:16,940
We used six ults.

2866
02:13:17,380 --> 02:13:17,780
We...

2867
02:13:17,780 --> 02:13:19,240
Holy shit!

2868
02:13:19,540 --> 02:13:20,560
We used...

2869
02:13:20,560 --> 02:13:23,780
We may or may not have used six ults there.

2870
02:13:24,420 --> 02:13:26,180
That might have been overkill.

2871
02:13:26,180 --> 02:13:27,000
That...

2872
02:13:28,320 --> 02:13:31,120
That was definitely overkill, right there.

2873
02:13:36,760 --> 02:13:39,200
Yeah, but we sort of did...

2874
02:13:39,200 --> 02:13:39,800
Oh, nice.

2875
02:13:41,340 --> 02:13:42,000
Uh...

2876
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:43,040
I'm not risking it.

2877
02:13:48,780 --> 02:13:49,660
Bubble, bubble.

2878
02:13:57,870 --> 02:13:59,750
That's a little embarrassing, buddy!

2879
02:14:02,950 --> 02:14:04,630
It's fine, I'm just gonna...

2880
02:14:05,730 --> 02:14:06,930
Oh my god...

2881
02:14:06,930 --> 02:14:07,790
What?!

2882
02:14:08,370 --> 02:14:10,430
Oh my god, how much damage I...

2883
02:14:10,430 --> 02:14:12,450
How much burst damage was that?!

2884
02:14:16,180 --> 02:14:16,700
What?!

2885
02:14:17,320 --> 02:14:18,120
Holy sh...

2886
02:14:18,120 --> 02:14:19,460
Okay, that was a lot of burst damage.

2887
02:14:19,600 --> 02:14:20,760
I was not expecting...

2888
02:14:23,240 --> 02:14:25,160
That was a lot of burst...

2889
02:14:25,160 --> 02:14:26,660
I should have soul-botted.

2890
02:14:27,240 --> 02:14:29,000
I was just not expecting that.

2891
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:32,280
Amazing how a world can create so much damage.

2892
02:14:32,580 --> 02:14:34,500
Yeah, because I snapped twice, too.

2893
02:14:35,560 --> 02:14:37,220
That's how I was like, what the fuck?!

2894
02:14:37,220 --> 02:14:39,080
How am I not alive?!

2895
02:14:39,080 --> 02:14:40,420
I was like...

2896
02:14:42,180 --> 02:14:44,120
How did this just end it?!

2897
02:14:50,220 --> 02:14:51,180
I need a...

2898
02:14:55,440 --> 02:14:56,040
Yeah...

2899
02:14:59,810 --> 02:15:01,390
It's fine, we're soul-bonded.

2900
02:15:03,550 --> 02:15:05,210
We're not soul-bonded anymore.

2901
02:15:06,090 --> 02:15:06,970
We're not...

2902
02:15:06,970 --> 02:15:08,550
We're not...

2903
02:15:11,330 --> 02:15:12,210
Oh no...

2904
02:15:12,210 --> 02:15:12,770
I need a...

2905
02:15:13,650 --> 02:15:14,090
NAAAHHH!

2906
02:15:14,210 --> 02:15:14,830
I wasted it!

2907
02:15:18,150 --> 02:15:18,590
Nice.

2908
02:15:19,010 --> 02:15:19,870
I have to...

2909
02:15:19,870 --> 02:15:21,430
I have to be away from this fight.

2910
02:15:21,510 --> 02:15:22,190
I don't want to all of them.

2911
02:15:22,330 --> 02:15:22,670
You respers.

2912
02:15:26,690 --> 02:15:28,250
Oh my god, who said that?

2913
02:15:28,670 --> 02:15:29,110
Or...

2914
02:15:29,110 --> 02:15:29,330
Or...

2915
02:15:29,330 --> 02:15:30,030
Or...

2916
02:15:30,210 --> 02:15:30,830
Or Luna.

2917
02:15:32,950 --> 02:15:34,530
You stop him in their tracks!

2918
02:15:34,670 --> 02:15:36,010
Two more minutes of this.

2919
02:15:36,630 --> 02:15:37,090
Oh, yes, aunt!

2920
02:15:37,210 --> 02:15:38,510
Thank you for the tier one sub!

2921
02:15:38,630 --> 02:15:39,390
Thank you, thank you!

2922
02:15:44,710 --> 02:15:45,130
Oh...

2923
02:15:45,130 --> 02:15:48,990
All right.

2924
02:15:49,290 --> 02:15:51,170
I'm a little worried about rezzing.

2925
02:15:53,370 --> 02:15:54,730
Because I feel like...

2926
02:15:59,750 --> 02:16:00,990
Just a little worried.

2927
02:16:01,550 --> 02:16:03,430
I can go very wrong.

2928
02:16:07,250 --> 02:16:11,210
Playing at him with rezz is always so fucking stressful!

2929
02:16:12,050 --> 02:16:13,770
Thank you for the five gifts and subs!

2930
02:16:13,950 --> 02:16:15,170
Thank you, thank you, yes, aunt!

2931
02:16:15,370 --> 02:16:16,390
I really appreciate it!

2932
02:16:16,470 --> 02:16:16,830
I'm gonna say it's real, give me, Adam.

2933
02:16:17,090 --> 02:16:18,210
Uh, rezz and all of them on this.

2934
02:16:20,730 --> 02:16:21,450
Oh, nice.

2935
02:16:22,710 --> 02:16:23,510
I believe you.

2936
02:16:26,210 --> 02:16:27,610
I'm not gonna waste it, then.

2937
02:16:29,730 --> 02:16:30,590
Oh, nice.

2938
02:16:30,810 --> 02:16:30,950
Okay.

2939
02:16:31,890 --> 02:16:32,710
We're fine!

2940
02:16:34,430 --> 02:16:35,010
Look at that!

2941
02:16:37,690 --> 02:16:39,610
I heard footsteps, but I'm a little schizo!

2942
02:16:44,990 --> 02:16:46,450
Take your meds!

2943
02:16:47,370 --> 02:16:53,530
Disclaimer-wise, I'm not schizo- That was a joke.

2944
02:16:53,990 --> 02:16:54,490
Guys!

2945
02:16:55,260 --> 02:16:56,390
But take your meds, though.

2946
02:16:56,570 --> 02:16:57,330
Take your meds, guys.

2947
02:16:57,750 --> 02:16:58,330
Take your meds!

2948
02:16:59,790 --> 02:17:03,590
I love it when my Oshii's a little crazy.

2949
02:17:07,150 --> 02:17:07,730
Okay.

2950
02:17:13,050 --> 02:17:13,630
Hello.

2951
02:17:16,650 --> 02:17:17,450
Welcome back.

2952
02:17:19,590 --> 02:17:19,990
Okay.

2953
02:17:20,750 --> 02:17:21,510
Welcome back.

2954
02:17:22,810 --> 02:17:23,630
Get down here.

2955
02:17:24,370 --> 02:17:25,450
We're gonna beat you up now.

2956
02:17:26,350 --> 02:17:26,950
We're gonna beat you up.

2957
02:17:27,050 --> 02:17:27,810
Get down over here.

2958
02:17:28,030 --> 02:17:28,750
We're gonna beat you up.

2959
02:17:28,950 --> 02:17:29,590
I'm gonna help.

2960
02:17:29,830 --> 02:17:30,090
Up set.

2961
02:17:30,410 --> 02:17:30,690
Up set.

2962
02:17:30,970 --> 02:17:31,770
Get over there.

2963
02:17:32,010 --> 02:17:32,750
Oh, he's...

2964
02:17:33,950 --> 02:17:34,590
Right here.

2965
02:17:35,630 --> 02:17:36,670
Oh, he didn't touch.

2966
02:17:36,670 --> 02:17:37,150
That's good.

2967
02:17:43,310 --> 02:17:45,330
He waited a little too long to touch that.

2968
02:17:49,170 --> 02:17:49,690
Yay!

2969
02:17:55,910 --> 02:17:58,090
Show me I bought myself a lot to learn.

2970
02:17:58,430 --> 02:18:00,010
I do too, honestly.

2971
02:18:00,650 --> 02:18:01,990
I'm not perfect.

2972
02:18:03,570 --> 02:18:06,330
I play this game, like, casually.

2973
02:18:07,850 --> 02:18:10,030
Literally yesterday I was...

2974
02:18:10,610 --> 02:18:13,330
Literally yesterday I was playing Dynasty Warriors.

2975
02:18:14,110 --> 02:18:14,590
Hehehehe.

2976
02:18:15,070 --> 02:18:15,550
600?

2977
02:18:16,010 --> 02:18:16,490
Really?

2978
02:18:16,610 --> 02:18:17,810
Wait, it's not that far.

2979
02:18:18,470 --> 02:18:19,410
Wait a minute.

2980
02:18:20,910 --> 02:18:21,870
It's 600?

2981
02:18:23,050 --> 02:18:24,490
For, like, one?

2982
02:18:25,210 --> 02:18:25,690
What?

2983
02:18:26,550 --> 02:18:27,510
That's 25.

2984
02:18:28,130 --> 02:18:29,790
That's, like, two more wins.

2985
02:18:29,930 --> 02:18:30,410
And then it's...

2986
02:18:32,870 --> 02:18:34,330
Yeah, it's two more wins.

2987
02:18:35,850 --> 02:18:36,810
Top 600.

2988
02:18:38,630 --> 02:18:39,110
Cat.

2989
02:18:39,250 --> 02:18:39,510
Okay.

2990
02:18:39,890 --> 02:18:40,210
Okay.

2991
02:18:40,870 --> 02:18:42,670
Okay, but I don't play this game every day.

2992
02:18:42,670 --> 02:18:44,250
I actually don't play this game every day.

2993
02:18:44,470 --> 02:18:45,570
I used to.

2994
02:18:45,890 --> 02:18:48,310
When I was, like, clinically addicted.

2995
02:18:48,850 --> 02:18:50,570
I have to ask.

2996
02:18:52,530 --> 02:18:53,850
When I was...

2997
02:18:53,850 --> 02:18:57,450
When I had a little issue going on with my addiction.

2998
02:18:58,070 --> 02:18:59,690
It was a really bad addiction.

2999
02:18:59,750 --> 02:19:00,990
I would admit.

3000
02:19:01,290 --> 02:19:04,650
I had played every day and it was not good for me.

3001
02:19:06,830 --> 02:19:08,850
It was a teeny tiny issue.

3002
02:19:09,210 --> 02:19:11,550
Like, it was so long ago, guys.

3003
02:19:11,550 --> 02:19:13,890
Like, so long ago.

3004
02:19:14,450 --> 02:19:16,090
I mean, four months ago.

3005
02:19:16,730 --> 02:19:17,250
Wow.

3006
02:19:23,760 --> 02:19:25,360
Four whole months ago.

3007
02:19:25,740 --> 02:19:25,880
Wow.

3008
02:19:28,220 --> 02:19:29,460
But I got better.

3009
02:19:31,560 --> 02:19:32,900
I got better, though.

3010
02:19:33,380 --> 02:19:34,260
What do you call this?

3011
02:19:35,720 --> 02:19:35,760
Um.

3012
02:19:39,040 --> 02:19:39,600
Therapy.

3013
02:19:43,400 --> 02:19:44,680
I told you guys.

3014
02:19:44,680 --> 02:19:46,840
This is my free therapy session.

3015
02:19:47,580 --> 02:19:49,560
I have a lot to unpack today.

3016
02:19:52,260 --> 02:19:53,180
Oh, daddy.

3017
02:19:53,380 --> 02:19:54,400
Thank you for the super chat.

3018
02:19:54,560 --> 02:19:54,800
Thank you.

3019
02:19:54,980 --> 02:19:55,180
Thank you.

3020
02:19:55,180 --> 02:19:55,640
Oh, fuck.

3021
02:19:55,980 --> 02:19:57,980
Thank you for the Twitch Prime.

3022
02:19:58,560 --> 02:19:58,960
Sorry.

3023
02:19:59,580 --> 02:19:59,940
Guys.

3024
02:20:00,060 --> 02:20:01,600
I was on YouTube for 12 hours.

3025
02:20:01,820 --> 02:20:02,720
Please understand.

3026
02:20:04,140 --> 02:20:05,180
Please understand.

3027
02:20:05,900 --> 02:20:08,300
I was on YouTube for 12 hours today.

3028
02:20:12,140 --> 02:20:15,240
But, daddy, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

3029
02:20:15,380 --> 02:20:15,580
Thank you.

3030
02:20:15,760 --> 02:20:16,260
Thank you.

3031
02:20:23,950 --> 02:20:25,270
No one's gonna stop.

3032
02:20:25,490 --> 02:20:26,570
Twitch will shut down my chat.

3033
02:20:26,590 --> 02:20:30,890
It's like, who's here using YouTube lingo in our house?

3034
02:20:32,250 --> 02:20:33,510
No, I love the grind.

3035
02:20:33,750 --> 02:20:35,230
I honestly do love the grind.

3036
02:20:35,730 --> 02:20:36,570
It's fun.

3037
02:20:37,250 --> 02:20:43,050
It gets me like, I have like, an issue with, um, the grind mindset.

3038
02:20:43,790 --> 02:20:46,950
I think like, I know like, in the past.

3039
02:20:48,890 --> 02:20:53,730
I think like, if I actually cared, I could have tried to go the pro route.

3040
02:20:54,870 --> 02:20:57,910
And then I realized you make more.

3041
02:20:58,470 --> 02:21:03,650
I realized that you make more money trimming whatever the fuck you want.

3042
02:21:04,330 --> 02:21:07,050
And also be less mentally ill.

3043
02:21:08,110 --> 02:21:11,830
From, like, less mentally ill from depression and stress.

3044
02:21:16,590 --> 02:21:20,110
From, from the, the pro grind.

3045
02:21:24,450 --> 02:21:25,370
Indeed.

3046
02:21:27,090 --> 02:21:27,550
Um.

3047
02:21:28,810 --> 02:21:30,030
No, it's true!

3048
02:21:30,030 --> 02:21:36,830
I was, okay, so I used to do, try, I used to like, do like, scrims and stuff in Overwatch.

3049
02:21:36,830 --> 02:21:39,230
And stuff like that when I was in top 500.

3050
02:21:40,350 --> 02:21:42,990
And, and I was always depressed.

3051
02:21:42,990 --> 02:21:44,710
I was so depressed.

3052
02:21:45,170 --> 02:21:46,690
Like, I was so depressed.

3053
02:21:46,690 --> 02:21:51,290
And I would be like, I cried a lot back then.

3054
02:21:51,910 --> 02:21:55,110
And, um, I was always super stressed out.

3055
02:21:55,110 --> 02:22:02,590
And my free time was basically like, scrims and body reviews and coaching and all that shit.

3056
02:22:02,950 --> 02:22:05,850
And like, I get nothing out of it.

3057
02:22:05,950 --> 02:22:08,350
Like, you don't make money out of it unless you stream it.

3058
02:22:13,110 --> 02:22:18,350
I remember, they're like, oh, why don't you try pro, freaking, what do you mean, try pro play?

3059
02:22:18,890 --> 02:22:21,930
I have a career in streaming whatever the fuck I want.

3060
02:22:25,830 --> 02:22:27,230
And I'm less sad.

3061
02:22:27,830 --> 02:22:30,570
The only times I get sad is when I crash out.

3062
02:22:31,130 --> 02:22:32,710
And lately, it's been a lot.

3063
02:22:32,970 --> 02:22:33,870
But like, it's okay.

3064
02:22:33,890 --> 02:22:34,690
I'm okay now.

3065
02:22:38,330 --> 02:22:39,530
I'm okay now.

3066
02:22:41,010 --> 02:22:43,550
You guys might be like, that's not true.

3067
02:22:44,070 --> 02:22:46,910
You just streamed 12 plus hours.

3068
02:22:47,250 --> 02:22:50,230
Oh wait, I think I'm at like 13 or 14 hour mark right now.

3069
02:22:50,310 --> 02:22:51,390
I'm at the 14 hour.

3070
02:22:51,590 --> 02:22:55,730
You streamed like 13 to 14 hours of rivals.

3071
02:22:55,930 --> 02:23:00,310
How is this not, how is this not, how is this like better?

3072
02:23:00,670 --> 02:23:15,090
But the thing is, like, the amount of times I've seen pro players tweet about like some fucking depressing shit right after like one loss is crazy.

3073
02:23:15,430 --> 02:23:17,910
Like, I think it's like 99% of pro players.

3074
02:23:19,250 --> 02:23:25,230
One loss, they'll tweet like some fucking philosophical or depressing shit.

3075
02:23:25,890 --> 02:23:30,730
And it's like, or like they'll, it's just sad to see.

3076
02:23:30,790 --> 02:23:31,870
That could have been me.

3077
02:23:32,550 --> 02:23:34,130
That, that could have been me.

3078
02:23:34,130 --> 02:23:34,650
Yeah.

3079
02:23:37,870 --> 02:23:40,710
Just to, yeah, they would sad post immediately.

3080
02:23:44,530 --> 02:23:49,350
And that is why, that's why, I play this casually.

3081
02:23:53,260 --> 02:23:56,180
Oh, Nira, they can put 10 gifted subs.

3082
02:23:56,400 --> 02:23:57,500
They can, thank you.

3083
02:23:57,760 --> 02:23:59,300
I really appreciate it.

3084
02:23:59,720 --> 02:24:00,620
Thank you guys.

3085
02:24:03,120 --> 02:24:05,020
Yeah, it's their jobs, yeah.

3086
02:24:05,620 --> 02:24:07,540
But it's like so much more stressful.

3087
02:24:08,460 --> 02:24:11,940
Because the thing is, you can't even stream half the content too.

3088
02:24:13,100 --> 02:24:14,140
Because, uh...

3089
02:24:16,240 --> 02:24:20,020
Because like, a lot of stuff is like restricted from streaming.

3090
02:24:20,580 --> 02:24:25,160
So you spent, you can't, it's so hard to build a streaming career outside of pro play.

3091
02:24:25,860 --> 02:24:31,760
Because you have to balance, you have to balance like pro play and the streaming career at the same time.

3092
02:24:31,960 --> 02:24:34,320
And there's not a lot of hours for you to do that.

3093
02:24:36,200 --> 02:24:37,080
And, um...

3094
02:24:37,600 --> 02:24:41,300
And because of that, it's like a lot more difficult to like...

3095
02:24:41,300 --> 02:24:47,800
That's why you see some pro players, they'll only focus on pro play and they won't do anything other than streaming.

3096
02:24:48,180 --> 02:24:49,280
And they won't even do streaming.

3097
02:24:51,060 --> 02:24:53,720
Because they just want to be the best they can be in the team.

3098
02:24:55,380 --> 02:24:58,020
Yeah, because they just don't have time to balance the two.

3099
02:24:58,020 --> 02:24:59,920
People don't have time to balance the two.

3100
02:25:03,220 --> 02:25:04,600
It's just very exhausting.

3101
02:25:05,040 --> 02:25:05,480
It is.

3102
02:25:05,900 --> 02:25:09,440
Someone that like, like, dappled a little before streaming.

3103
02:25:09,840 --> 02:25:11,780
In like, the Overwatch scene.

3104
02:25:13,920 --> 02:25:16,360
Uh, Pilgrim, thank you for the five kip that's so.

3105
02:25:16,460 --> 02:25:17,420
Thank you, thank you.

3106
02:25:17,760 --> 02:25:18,660
Well like, usually...

3107
02:25:19,920 --> 02:25:22,960
Usually you're not allowed to stream like scrims and stuff.

3108
02:25:23,520 --> 02:25:25,680
Or like, it's not a good like, streaming.

3109
02:25:25,680 --> 02:25:27,880
I personally don't think like, streaming...

3110
02:25:27,880 --> 02:25:30,460
Because it's a good streaming experience.

3111
02:25:30,620 --> 02:25:32,500
Just because you have to mute comms and everything.

3112
02:25:33,020 --> 02:25:36,640
And then, oh yeah, esports salaries have apparently been going down more and more.

3113
02:25:37,120 --> 02:25:40,380
Because like, back then, esports salaries are like, were so good.

3114
02:25:41,180 --> 02:25:43,760
Uh, because, uh, people didn't know.

3115
02:25:44,240 --> 02:25:45,240
Because people...

3116
02:25:45,240 --> 02:25:46,940
Esports was a new thing.

3117
02:25:47,120 --> 02:25:48,900
So people were like, just throwing money everywhere.

3118
02:25:49,200 --> 02:25:49,760
I mean, literally...

3119
02:25:50,620 --> 02:25:55,240
Literally, Overwatch League teams were owned by billionaires.

3120
02:25:55,240 --> 02:26:00,080
Who own, uh, were owned by billionaires.

3121
02:26:00,440 --> 02:26:04,740
Who own, uh, baseball and basketball teams.

3122
02:26:05,180 --> 02:26:07,140
And football teams too.

3123
02:26:08,060 --> 02:26:10,380
Because they didn't know where things were gonna go.

3124
02:26:14,510 --> 02:26:20,830
So exhausting that XQC was actually a pro player and quit to watch Dora the Explorer, whatever else he's doing.

3125
02:26:25,570 --> 02:26:29,650
Yeah, but one, the amount of stuff he's watched.

3126
02:26:30,390 --> 02:26:31,610
From, like, the amount of money.

3127
02:26:31,810 --> 02:26:43,670
I bet you, watching that one episode of Dora the Explorer, basically made him the same, The same salary as an entire year in Overwatch League.

3128
02:26:50,510 --> 02:26:53,730
I do it, I do it with him.

3129
02:26:59,650 --> 02:27:00,650
No, it's true.

3130
02:27:00,990 --> 02:27:03,210
There's some death contracts out there.

3131
02:27:04,150 --> 02:27:10,630
You see, like, you know how, like, there's, like, some game, some orgs where, like, one loss and you're instantly replaced.

3132
02:27:10,630 --> 02:27:12,350
Or something, or your roster gets dropped.

3133
02:27:12,590 --> 02:27:14,090
Because they want, it's, it's true though.

3134
02:27:15,910 --> 02:27:19,150
Because they want a team, they don't want to waste money, so they just, like, cut you out.

3135
02:27:20,950 --> 02:27:23,110
It's just incredibly stressful in general.

3136
02:27:25,870 --> 02:27:28,430
Oh, this is a stacked lobby.

3137
02:27:33,310 --> 02:27:35,410
This is a stacked lobby.

3138
02:27:35,670 --> 02:27:36,570
We have no tank players.

3139
02:27:39,150 --> 02:27:41,730
I was like, yippee!

3140
02:27:42,610 --> 02:27:45,070
And I realized, wait, we have no tank players.

3141
02:27:47,610 --> 02:27:50,670
I hope one of these guys played tank.

3142
02:28:05,900 --> 02:28:06,600
Trying to lobby?

3143
02:28:06,960 --> 02:28:08,600
Yes, because pro player.

3144
02:28:09,020 --> 02:28:09,820
Pro player.

3145
02:28:09,980 --> 02:28:11,740
And he's duo'd with another pro.

3146
02:28:11,880 --> 02:28:12,940
I don't remember which one.

3147
02:28:13,820 --> 02:28:17,260
And then March is duo'd, too, with a pro player.

3148
02:28:19,980 --> 02:28:20,500
Thoughts?

3149
02:28:20,680 --> 02:28:21,200
Opinions?

3150
02:28:22,920 --> 02:28:23,440
Suggestions?

3151
02:28:25,660 --> 02:28:26,180
Ideas?

3152
02:28:27,960 --> 02:28:29,000
Bruce Banner?

3153
02:28:29,600 --> 02:28:30,120
White Hawk.

3154
02:28:32,610 --> 02:28:34,330

Come on.

3218
02:31:23,910 --> 02:31:25,230
Come on, we stack.

02:31:26,690 --> 02:31:27,010
We stack.

3220
02:31:27,010 --> 02:31:27,310
We stack.

02:31:37,240 --> 02:31:39,460
Double to the rocket.

3222
02:31:39,460 --> 02:31:39,800
There it is.

3223
02:31:39,860 --> 02:31:40,880
I got lost.

3224
02:31:41,840 --> 02:31:43,000
Oh my god.

3225
02:31:43,120 --> 02:31:43,920
I have to use it.

3226
02:31:45,160 --> 02:31:46,100
That's unlucky.

3227

Oh my hero!

3230
02:32:01,160 --> 02:32:02,580
Where's my Psylocke?

3231
02:32:02,760 --> 02:32:03,140
There he is.

3232
02:32:03,980 --> 02:32:04,900
Oh my...

3233
02:32:04,900 --> 02:32:06,620
Okay, that was pretty clutch.

3234
02:32:06,620 --> 02:32:07,480
You gotta admit.

3235
02:32:07,720 --> 02:32:09,400
That was actually insane.

3236
02:32:10,060 --> 02:32:12,020
My fucking hero.

But I live, bitch.

3241

3412
02:37:33,890 --> 02:37:35,450
Oh my god, are you serious?

3413
02:37:35,890 --> 02:37:38,330
Oh my god, I did the hook jump in.

3414
02:37:43,270 --> 02:37:45,730
I just get maximum pause.

3415
02:37:46,310 --> 02:37:49,950
No matter where I go, it's always me.

3416
02:38:02,530 --> 02:38:04,350
Oh my god, I have to be in here.

3417
02:38:04,490 --> 02:38:05,110
I got worried.

3418
02:38:05,370 --> 02:38:06,770
I got so worried.

3419
02:38:06,770 --> 02:38:15,850
Five, four, three, two, one.

3420
02:38:16,450 --> 02:38:18,790
Oh my god, I'm missing my... goodbye.

3421
02:38:20,310 --> 02:38:22,450
Leave me alone!

3422
02:38:35,770 --> 02:38:39,710
Oh my god, I'm fucking...

3423
02:38:40,790 --> 02:38:41,350
It's fine.

3424
02:38:44,990 --> 02:38:45,770
I'm not fine.

3425
02:38:45,870 --> 02:38:46,390
I'm not fine.

3426
02:38:46,490 --> 02:38:47,190
This is where I die.

3427
02:38:47,370 --> 02:38:48,430
This is where I die.

3428
02:38:48,630 --> 02:38:49,470
Don't kill me, please.

3429
02:38:49,650 --> 02:38:50,970
I don't want another death.

3430
02:38:50,970 --> 02:38:53,310
One, two, two, zero.

3431
02:38:53,610 --> 02:38:54,750
That's a rash.

3432
02:38:56,970 --> 02:39:00,550
Every time I look around, I get maximum pulse.

3433
02:39:01,190 --> 02:39:02,230
Seven Deadly Sins.

3434
02:39:02,370 --> 02:39:03,410

Oh my gosh, you can't read this.

3438
02:39:06,750 --> 02:39:07,710
You can't order it.

3439
02:39:08,210 --> 02:39:09,410
Let me see what...

3440
02:39:09,410 --> 02:39:10,610
What this...

3441
02:39:10,610 --> 02:39:12,050
How to pronounce this.

3442
02:39:13,430 --> 02:39:14,650
Oh, it just means...

3443
02:39:14,650 --> 02:39:16,510
How do I pronounce this for the biddies?

3444
02:39:17,290 --> 02:39:18,270
Oh my god.

3445
02:39:19,290 --> 02:39:21,650
I'm trying to figure out the tight language.

3446
02:39:22,210 --> 02:39:22,350
Oh.

3447
02:39:23,370 --> 02:39:24,050
Hong Kong?

3448
02:39:24,550 --> 02:39:24,890
Hong Kong?

3449
02:39:25,930 --> 02:39:26,670

02:39:26,870 --> 02:39:27,490

3452
02:39:29,450 --> 02:39:30,330

Wait, see.

3463
02:39:46,580 --> 02:39:47,900
I really fell that far.

3464
02:39:48,060 --> 02:39:48,460
What happened?

3465
02:39:50,580 --> 02:39:51,060

Whoa.

3475
02:40:06,340 --> 02:40:07,060
It's like I'm like...

3476
02:40:08,140 --> 02:40:09,200
Beans or something.

3477
02:40:10,960 --> 02:40:11,440

It's giving me my fourth win.

3483
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:36,220
Jesus Christ.

3484
02:40:42,300 --> 02:40:43,460
Okay, we're fine.

3485
02:40:43,860 --> 02:40:44,840
We're so healthy.

3486
02:40:46,900 --> 02:40:48,220

3487
02:40:48,220 --> 02:40:48,940
Oh my god.

3488
02:40:52,180 --> 02:40:54,630
It's just unfortunate because I am...

3489
02:40:55,510 --> 02:40:56,550
I'm getting hot.

3490
02:40:56,710 --> 02:40:58,110

3491
02:40:58,110 --> 02:41:01,630

3492
02:41:04,030 --> 02:41:08,570
I'm eating every fucking Iron Man and I don't know how that's possible for me.

What do I do?

3498
02:41:21,560 --> 02:41:22,240
If

3499
02:41:26,200 --> 02:41:29,340
I go towards my team, they die.

3500
02:41:29,580 --> 02:41:30,940
So I have to...

3501
02:41:30,940 --> 02:41:31,500

Like...

3511
02:42:05,960 --> 02:42:07,300
What do I do?

02:42:09,640 --> 02:42:10,740
I hate it!

3513
02:42:11,680 --> 02:42:12,820
Oh my god.

3514

I do not know why he didn't do that.

3515
02:42:17,400 --> 02:42:18,460
Maximum pulse!

3516
02:42:25,340 --> 02:42:26,740
This is like a...

3517
02:42:26,740 --> 02:42:27,420
I'm reporting.

3518
02:42:27,680 --> 02:42:28,940
I'm reporting.

3519
02:42:29,240 --> 02:42:29,800
I'm reporting.

3520
02:42:29,800 --> 02:42:30,300
I'm reporting.

3521
02:42:30,600 --> 02:42:31,660
This is a hate crime.

3522
02:42:32,800 --> 02:42:35,580
This is actually a hate crime now.

3523
02:42:36,700 --> 02:42:37,320
Like...

3524
02:42:37,320 --> 02:42:37,540

I can't play it!

3527
02:42:39,880 --> 02:42:42,200
I'm fucking up, I can't.

3528
02:42:42,320 --> 02:42:43,580
I can't.

3529
02:42:44,360 --> 02:42:46,960
My god, there's no outplayability!

3530
02:42:49,120 --> 02:42:52,200
There's no outplayability here!

3531
02:42:52,440 --> 02:42:54,620
Like, how do I outplay that?

3532
02:42:55,100 --> 02:42:56,000
How do I?

3533
02:42:56,100 --> 02:42:58,260
There's literally no outplayability.

3534
02:42:58,920 --> 02:43:01,940
Bro, there's no... I'm reporting.

3535
02:43:02,620 --> 02:43:04,700
There's no outplayability.

3536
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:08,440
There's actually no outplayability here.

3537
02:43:09,180 --> 02:43:11,900
It's literally... they're just... fuck me.

3538
02:43:16,020 --> 02:43:17,140
It's just...

3539
02:43:25,730 --> 02:43:33,130
Oh my god, I think the only outplayability I can do is literally I have to land my freezes as much as I can.

3540
02:43:39,310 --> 02:43:41,870
Next time, I'm just... I'm just gonna go into my team.

3541
02:43:42,070 --> 02:43:42,790
I swear to god.

3542
02:43:43,110 --> 02:43:44,530
I'm just gonna go to my team.

3543
02:43:47,730 --> 02:43:51,450
If I'm... if I'm gonna... I swear to god.

3544
02:43:53,690 --> 02:43:56,710
If he does that again, I'm gonna do it.

3545
02:44:09,250 --> 02:44:11,010
I'm... I'm gonna do it.

3546
02:44:12,370 --> 02:44:13,570
I... I'm gonna do it.

3547
02:44:13,630 --> 02:44:13,750
I... I'm gonna bubble.

3548
02:44:13,750 --> 02:44:14,070
Okay.

3549
02:44:23,140 --> 02:44:23,660
Uh...

3550
02:44:27,340 --> 02:44:28,200
Oh my god!

3551
02:44:28,400 --> 02:44:29,260
Oh my god!

3552
02:44:30,280 --> 02:44:32,060
What... what is this?

3553
02:44:32,380 --> 02:44:33,240
Oh my god!

3554
02:44:33,240 --> 02:44:33,320
Oh my god!

3555
02:44:35,800 --> 02:44:36,920
I'm dead.

3556
02:44:37,460 --> 02:44:38,400
I'm so dead.

3557
02:44:40,520 --> 02:44:43,870
I'm so dead.

3558
02:44:45,210 --> 02:44:46,090
I'm so...

3559
02:44:46,090 --> 02:44:46,210
I'm so...

3560
02:44:46,210 --> 02:44:48,790
I'm... I'm really just getting fucking bullied.

3561
02:44:49,470 --> 02:44:52,630
I need two feet... from two miles away.

3562
02:44:53,270 --> 02:44:54,150
I need...

3563
02:44:57,450 --> 02:44:59,850
Holy shit, I can't live!

3564
02:45:00,310 --> 02:45:02,390
I can't fucking... Okay.

3565
02:45:03,090 --> 02:45:03,910
I'm okay.

3566
02:45:04,390 --> 02:45:05,350
I'm okay.

3567
02:45:07,870 --> 02:45:09,110
I'm okay, guys.

3568
02:45:10,570 --> 02:45:17,170
The one time he stopped looking at me, I think... I... I'm swapping.

3569
02:45:17,430 --> 02:45:17,930
I can't.

3570
02:45:18,550 --> 02:45:19,490
I can't.

3571
02:45:19,570 --> 02:45:21,630
There's literally no survivability here.

3572
02:45:22,310 --> 02:45:23,790
Oh my god, I can't swap.

3573
02:45:23,950 --> 02:45:24,910
There's nothing else to swap.

3574
02:45:25,470 --> 02:45:27,150
Fuck, they banned Loki.

3575
02:45:29,210 --> 02:45:30,230
I can't peek, bro.

3576
02:45:30,350 --> 02:45:30,770
I cannot peek.

3577
02:45:30,950 --> 02:45:31,950
This Ironman's doing whatever he wants.

3578
02:45:33,390 --> 02:45:36,070
I mean, bro, I... I'm shooting him as much as I can.

3579
02:45:37,210 --> 02:45:39,050
I'm not dead, then I'm fucking 1hp.

3580
02:45:41,530 --> 02:45:43,150
You people are like, fuck this.

3581
02:45:45,410 --> 02:45:47,430
There's nothing they banned Loki.

3582
02:45:49,930 --> 02:45:52,230
They banned my only escape.

3583
02:45:52,570 --> 02:45:54,610
Well, you can't expect to win them all.

3584
02:45:54,890 --> 02:45:56,230
At least I got subs, though.

3585
02:46:11,990 --> 02:46:14,070
Wait, okay, this...

3586
02:46:15,830 --> 02:46:17,030
Guys, this is a joke.

3587
02:46:17,310 --> 02:46:18,390
This is a joke.

3588
02:46:45,510 --> 02:46:46,910
I deserve it.

3589
02:46:54,150 --> 02:46:57,630
Why was I supposed to use no playability?

3590
02:46:58,050 --> 02:47:00,070
It was never a shield for me.

3591
02:47:00,530 --> 02:47:07,130
I had to... I tried to go away from my team because he was still... I didn't want to... want the ult to kill everyone.

3592
02:47:08,550 --> 02:47:09,410
Dude, what you got?

3593
02:47:09,630 --> 02:47:11,450
I'm gonna use the bathtub right back.

3594
02:47:11,950 --> 02:47:14,290
Look, I'm thinking of the 5k if it's so sick and thank you.

3595
02:48:23,950 --> 02:48:24,790
I'm back.

3596
02:48:28,890 --> 02:48:30,210
I'm back, guys.

3597
02:48:31,290 --> 02:48:31,890
Wait, is he here?

3598
02:48:32,050 --> 02:48:33,250
That's right, you deserve that.

3599
02:48:35,330 --> 02:48:38,470
If I get banned, don't worry, I have connections.

3600
02:48:43,650 --> 02:48:45,070
I'll get unbanned.

3601
02:48:45,450 --> 02:48:46,590
You can't stop me.

3602
02:48:53,290 --> 02:48:54,410
That's crazy.

3603
02:48:59,400 --> 02:49:01,600
Um, Eddie, thank you for gifting us up.

3604
02:49:01,820 --> 02:49:02,080
Thank you.

3605
02:49:02,220 --> 02:49:02,860
Thank you.

3606
02:49:04,380 --> 02:49:05,200
That's right.

3607
02:49:05,560 --> 02:49:06,460
No, okay.

3608
02:49:06,700 --> 02:49:09,080
At first I was like, is he targeting me?

3609
02:49:09,360 --> 02:49:11,080
No, maybe I'm just out of position.

3610
02:49:11,380 --> 02:49:14,720
But then he fucking went straight to my face.

3611
02:49:15,760 --> 02:49:16,720
Everyone watched.

3612
02:49:17,760 --> 02:49:17,860
Everyone watched.

3613
02:49:17,860 --> 02:49:19,040
No one shot him.

3614
02:49:19,260 --> 02:49:21,220
And I still die.

3615
02:49:24,540 --> 02:49:27,560
And then that's when I knew it was a hate crime.

3616
02:49:27,880 --> 02:49:29,260
That's when I knew.

3617
02:49:32,730 --> 02:49:33,490
That's when I knew.

3618
02:49:33,490 --> 02:49:33,670
That's right.

3619
02:49:45,400 --> 02:49:48,880
Quantum, thank you for gifting a sub to Rigsy and March.

3620
02:49:49,660 --> 02:49:50,860
I really appreciate it.

3621
02:49:50,880 --> 02:49:51,140
Thank you.

3622
02:49:51,320 --> 02:49:51,980
Thank you.

3623
02:49:56,020 --> 02:49:58,100
Yeah, after the third one.

3624
02:49:58,880 --> 02:50:01,320
This is why there's no more support players.

3625
02:50:01,700 --> 02:50:02,800
This is why.

3626
02:50:04,340 --> 02:50:08,000
This is why no, no support players want to play anymore.

3627
02:50:15,210 --> 02:50:16,630
Now ban him.

3628
02:50:17,730 --> 02:50:18,550
No, I'll farm.

3629
02:50:23,010 --> 02:50:26,190
I'll farm his viewers because I know he's watching my stream.

3630
02:50:29,310 --> 02:50:33,910
By the way, check me out on Twitch, slash DokiBird, my stream.

3631
02:50:34,570 --> 02:50:35,870
Check me out.

3632
02:50:39,750 --> 02:50:40,950
So smart.

3633
02:50:46,470 --> 02:50:51,690
I'm gonna fucking avoid the rank one, the peak rank one leaderboard guy.

3634
02:50:54,890 --> 02:50:56,670
There's enough ELO terrorists.

3635
02:50:57,230 --> 02:50:58,790
There's enough ELO terrorists.

3636
02:50:58,790 --> 02:50:59,910
In this world.

3637
02:51:00,350 --> 02:51:03,730
Why the fuck would I use it on the peak rank one guy?

3638
02:51:05,270 --> 02:51:06,290
They can add me.

3639
02:51:07,770 --> 02:51:08,630
Who's this guy?

3640
02:51:09,350 --> 02:51:10,110
Jeff's wiener?

3641
02:51:12,950 --> 02:51:15,370
Don't think because you have a clever name, I'll add you.

3642
02:51:15,850 --> 02:51:16,310
Jeff.

3643
02:51:21,130 --> 02:51:21,790
Are we cute?

3644
02:51:21,910 --> 02:51:22,370
Oh, we are cute.

3645
02:51:22,530 --> 02:51:24,730
Oh yeah, it's like 3 in the fucking morning.

3646
02:51:25,130 --> 02:51:26,310
The queues are so long.

3647
02:51:26,650 --> 02:51:27,410
At this time.

3648
02:51:27,570 --> 02:51:27,810
No!

3649
02:51:28,550 --> 02:51:29,870
I'm 885 now.

3650
02:51:30,870 --> 02:51:31,250
Sag.

3651
02:51:34,190 --> 02:51:36,510
Look, it's like 3 in the morning.

3652
02:51:37,090 --> 02:51:40,570
I've been playing Ravel since the XQC tournament.

3653
02:51:41,410 --> 02:51:42,370
And like...

3654
02:51:43,790 --> 02:51:47,150
My brain has devolved into like...

3655
02:51:47,150 --> 02:51:48,050
Like...

3656
02:51:48,050 --> 02:51:52,170
A fucking pre-present little boy in middle school.

3657
02:51:52,810 --> 02:51:54,690
Like anything is funny to me now.

3658
02:51:59,480 --> 02:52:01,000
Oh yeah, where was that that hulk?

3659
02:52:01,160 --> 02:52:01,900
No, you know what?

3660
02:52:02,300 --> 02:52:03,520
I'm gonna report the hulk too.

3661
02:52:03,620 --> 02:52:04,480
That reminds me.

3662
02:52:04,480 --> 02:52:04,860
...

3663
02:52:04,860 --> 02:52:06,960
...

3664
02:52:10,180 --> 02:52:10,810
See?

3665
02:52:11,110 --> 02:52:12,150
Oh there...

3666
02:52:12,970 --> 02:52:15,250
He joined in.

3667
02:52:15,950 --> 02:52:16,530
...

3668
02:52:18,840 --> 02:52:20,150
After his...

3669
02:52:20,150 --> 02:52:20,230
...

3670
02:52:20,230 --> 02:52:22,170
The hulk too.

3671
02:52:22,170 --> 02:52:27,830
No, that was also... Like, he wasn't part of the problem until the second half.

3672
02:52:34,530 --> 02:52:40,430
After the second half, when he, like, solo ulted me, he turned on his...

3673
02:52:40,430 --> 02:52:43,510
When he solo ulted me, like, three times.

3674
02:52:44,130 --> 02:52:45,910
I almost forgot about that.

3675
02:52:46,530 --> 02:52:49,730
I was too busy fucking crashing out on the first part.

3676
02:52:53,170 --> 02:52:54,710
It was an accomplice.

3677
02:52:59,780 --> 02:53:02,240
I can't believe this.

3678
02:53:02,480 --> 02:53:05,420
I do it all the time in Overwatch, and I never got banned.

3679
02:53:06,440 --> 02:53:07,180
On stream!

3680
02:53:07,440 --> 02:53:08,800
On stream, I did it every...

3681
02:53:10,640 --> 02:53:16,100
Okay, when I say all the time in Overwatch, I meant, like, once every couple of months.

3682
02:53:16,540 --> 02:53:19,740
Once or twice every couple of months.

3683
02:53:19,920 --> 02:53:21,120
Where, you know...

3684
02:53:21,120 --> 02:53:23,840
You know when you're, like, really mad?

3685
02:53:24,180 --> 02:53:27,800
And you gotta let out some steam, and you just start, like, reporting a person?

3686
02:53:28,100 --> 02:53:29,720
For, like, a thing they did to you?

3687
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:31,780
But it was not, like, you know, legit?

3688
02:53:32,860 --> 02:53:33,260
Like...

3689
02:53:34,580 --> 02:53:35,180
You know?

3690
02:53:35,460 --> 02:53:36,960
Like, they're not hacking or anything.

3691
02:53:37,180 --> 02:53:38,620
Or they don't say any slurs.

3692
02:53:38,900 --> 02:53:41,260
But, like, you know, they did something to you.

3693
02:53:41,460 --> 02:53:43,920
And you just gotta, you know, you just gotta do a little report.

3694
02:53:44,200 --> 02:53:45,760
You just gotta do a...

3695
02:53:45,760 --> 02:53:46,860
A little report.

3696
02:53:54,600 --> 02:53:57,740
Yeah, and then, you know, it's, like, the little joys in life.

3697
02:53:58,460 --> 02:53:59,620
Wait, I should claim this.

3698
02:54:00,260 --> 02:54:01,220
They gave me Adam?

3699
02:54:02,360 --> 02:54:04,260
They just automatically gave me...

3700
02:54:04,260 --> 02:54:05,000
Oh my god!

3701
02:54:05,220 --> 02:54:08,360
They automatically just gave me Adam because I never picked!

3702
02:54:08,920 --> 02:54:10,520
I'm so fucking stupid!

3703
02:54:10,860 --> 02:54:11,760
Oh yeah, I should open this.

3704
02:54:12,360 --> 02:54:12,640
Yay!

3705
02:54:12,980 --> 02:54:14,060
I completed phase two!

3706
02:54:14,680 --> 02:54:16,400
And all I got was 20 tokens.

3707
02:54:17,960 --> 02:54:19,380
How do you do this?

3708
02:54:21,680 --> 02:54:22,660
Oh, okay.

3709
02:54:23,600 --> 02:54:24,580
Wait, did I not finish it?

3710
02:54:27,300 --> 02:54:28,540
What's that to do?

3711
02:54:29,740 --> 02:54:32,280
Upvote six allies in a quick match.

3712
02:54:32,520 --> 02:54:34,000
Land 30 final hits.

3713
02:54:34,600 --> 02:54:35,820
Complete six matches.

3714
02:54:37,420 --> 02:54:39,120
Defeat 50 enemies.

3715
02:54:39,880 --> 02:54:40,480
Wait.

3716
02:54:41,260 --> 02:54:42,460
Did I not do it?

3717
02:54:43,440 --> 02:54:44,780
I completed it.

3718
02:54:45,060 --> 02:54:45,440
Yeah.

3719
02:54:46,400 --> 02:54:46,920
Oh, nice.

3720
02:54:47,140 --> 02:54:48,620
Okay, now it's act three.

3721
02:54:50,820 --> 02:54:52,460
No, I completed this.

3722
02:54:52,580 --> 02:54:53,040
This is done.

3723
02:54:53,320 --> 02:54:54,260
So now it's this time.

3724
02:54:55,060 --> 02:54:55,720
Now I gotta wait.

3725
02:54:58,500 --> 02:54:59,600
What the fuck?

3726
02:55:00,480 --> 02:55:01,320
Where did...

3727
02:55:01,320 --> 02:55:03,880
How did my thing jump request?

3728
02:55:04,300 --> 02:55:05,280
Oh, there's...

3729
02:55:05,280 --> 02:55:06,160
There's a marsh...

3730
02:55:06,160 --> 02:55:07,440
Wait, how are you...

3731
02:55:07,440 --> 02:55:08,580
Celestial too?

3732
02:55:09,200 --> 02:55:10,940
Oh, no wonder you were crying.

3733
02:55:11,520 --> 02:55:13,040
Oh, and you hit your profile.

3734
02:55:15,540 --> 02:55:16,120
No...

3735
02:55:29,590 --> 02:55:30,710
Don't keep...

3736
02:55:30,710 --> 02:55:32,430
Don't do him like that.

3737
02:55:32,650 --> 02:55:33,510
Oh, my God.

3738
02:55:33,690 --> 02:55:36,050
Oh, I was wondering what he meant by that.

3739
02:55:36,390 --> 02:55:38,330
When he was like...

3740
02:55:38,970 --> 02:55:40,930
I really fell that far.

3741
02:55:41,210 --> 02:55:44,250
Like, I was like, what do you mean?

3742
02:55:44,570 --> 02:55:46,290
Oh my god, I'm sorry.

3743
02:55:46,510 --> 02:55:47,330
You're in my elo.

3744
02:55:47,710 --> 02:55:48,530
How does that feel?

3745
02:55:56,870 --> 02:55:58,490
Oh my god, these keys are long.

3746
02:56:04,880 --> 02:56:05,400
Oh.

3747
02:56:08,360 --> 02:56:08,900
Alright.

3748
02:56:09,360 --> 02:56:10,380
Is it a doom match?

3749
02:56:10,600 --> 02:56:11,880
It's taking 10 minutes?

3750
02:56:13,140 --> 02:56:15,480
I haven't been in a 10 minute queue in so long.

3751
02:56:16,320 --> 02:56:17,720
Oh, it's 3 in the morning.

3752
02:56:19,340 --> 02:56:21,800
Can you pass the trial of your soul?

3753
02:56:23,720 --> 02:56:25,060
Alright, are they role-playing?

3754
02:56:28,160 --> 02:56:29,020
There you go.

3755
02:56:29,240 --> 02:56:30,260
No role-play for you.

3756
02:56:31,060 --> 02:56:32,700
Oh, I'll role-play with you.

3757
02:56:33,480 --> 02:56:34,720
Whoa, hey guys.

3758
02:56:35,420 --> 02:56:37,400
You didn't see what I... Hey ladies.

3759
02:56:38,500 --> 02:56:39,500
Oh, what the fuck?

3760
02:56:42,240 --> 02:56:43,480
Oh my god.

3761
02:56:44,400 --> 02:56:46,800
I just wanted to talk to the ladies.

3762
02:56:46,800 --> 02:56:51,320
I don't believe the role- I was trying to talk to the ladies!

3763
02:56:53,440 --> 02:56:56,260
This is why I can't have female friends.

3764
02:56:59,040 --> 02:57:00,280
Where are the ladies?

3765
02:57:00,700 --> 02:57:01,660
Hello ladies.

3766
02:57:02,600 --> 02:57:05,560
I would like to have more female friends.

3767
02:57:06,760 --> 02:57:08,880
Is this how females interact?

3768
02:57:09,980 --> 02:57:10,620
Hello.

3769
02:57:11,580 --> 02:57:14,060
Hello, my fellow female friends.

3770
02:57:15,320 --> 02:57:17,000
The game didn't die.

3771
02:57:17,960 --> 02:57:18,780
Hey me.

3772
02:57:18,980 --> 02:57:19,380
Oh my gosh.

3773
02:57:19,460 --> 02:57:20,420
Oh, they're all healing themselves.

3774
02:57:21,380 --> 02:57:22,240
What am I?

3775
02:57:27,240 --> 02:57:29,380
How do you do, fellow females?

3776
02:57:30,380 --> 02:57:33,120
I'm really bad at interacting with women.

3777
02:57:34,180 --> 02:57:35,620
I'm so relatable.

3778
02:57:37,880 --> 02:57:40,880
Oh yeah, for those who didn't know, I had a talk with...

3779
02:57:40,880 --> 02:57:42,380
Everyone about how...

3780
02:57:43,280 --> 02:57:45,260
I don't really have a lot of female friends.

3781
02:57:46,420 --> 02:57:47,560
I've... I like...

3782
02:57:47,560 --> 02:57:48,600
Because like...

3783
02:57:49,600 --> 02:57:51,220
I was talking about how like...

3784
02:57:51,220 --> 02:57:56,060
It's just easier to handle male friends than it is female friends.

3785
02:57:56,720 --> 02:57:57,780
Because like...

3786
02:57:58,700 --> 02:58:00,560
I have a lot of like...

3787
02:58:00,560 --> 02:58:04,040
Solo female friends, but not like female group friends, really.

3788
02:58:04,560 --> 02:58:05,540
It's just... I...

3789
02:58:05,540 --> 02:58:06,900
From personal experience?

3790
02:58:07,700 --> 02:58:10,100
From personal experience?

3791
02:58:11,040 --> 02:58:12,340
It's like...

3792
02:58:12,340 --> 02:58:15,480
I had a lot of negative experience with like...

3793
02:58:15,480 --> 02:58:16,400
Groups of women.

3794
02:58:17,680 --> 02:58:18,820
And like...

3795
02:58:18,820 --> 02:58:20,470
There was just less drama...

3796
02:58:21,020 --> 02:58:22,100
There was just less drama...

3797
02:58:22,720 --> 02:58:23,640
With like...

3798
02:58:23,640 --> 02:58:24,580
Male friends...

3799
02:58:24,580 --> 02:58:25,540
Than...

3800
02:58:25,540 --> 02:58:27,020
Female friends.

3801
02:58:28,930 --> 02:58:30,040
So it's like...

3802
02:58:30,040 --> 02:58:31,260
It's easier...

3803
02:58:31,260 --> 02:58:32,820
It was just easier to hang out.

3804
02:58:35,060 --> 02:58:36,420
No, it's just...

3805
02:58:36,420 --> 02:58:38,580
It's just like a mental warfare sometimes.

3806
02:58:43,060 --> 02:58:44,100
Because it's like...

3807
02:58:44,100 --> 02:58:45,660
I've had moments where like...

3808
02:58:45,660 --> 02:58:45,960
They...

3809
02:58:45,960 --> 02:58:46,840
Like you know...

3810
02:58:46,840 --> 02:58:48,580
Like one of my ex group of...

3811
02:58:48,580 --> 02:58:49,540
Female friends...

3812
02:58:49,540 --> 02:58:50,920
Who I'm not friends with anymore...

3813
02:58:50,920 --> 02:58:51,320
In high...

3814
02:58:51,320 --> 02:58:51,940
It was like...

3815
02:58:51,940 --> 02:58:52,620
High school.

3816
02:58:52,820 --> 02:58:53,400
This was high school.

3817
02:58:53,660 --> 02:58:54,560
Okay, I'll tell you the story.

3818
02:58:54,780 --> 02:58:56,320
This was a high school experience I had.

3819
02:58:56,580 --> 02:58:57,360
It was fucking terrible.

3820
02:58:57,980 --> 02:58:58,260
Um...

3821
02:58:58,260 --> 02:59:00,180
It was like an online group of female friends.

3822
02:59:00,380 --> 02:59:00,920
And it was a group.

3823
02:59:01,380 --> 02:59:02,160
And then...

3824
02:59:02,160 --> 02:59:02,900
So...

3825
02:59:03,900 --> 02:59:04,340
Um...

3826
02:59:05,660 --> 02:59:06,100
Um...

3827
02:59:06,100 --> 02:59:07,500
They like...

3828
02:59:07,500 --> 02:59:09,320
They would gossip about each other.

3829
02:59:09,320 --> 02:59:10,500
And then like...

3830
02:59:10,500 --> 02:59:12,280
Talk shit about each other.

3831
02:59:12,500 --> 02:59:13,280
But then like...

3832
02:59:13,280 --> 02:59:14,180
To like other...

3833
02:59:14,180 --> 02:59:14,500
You know....

3834
02:59:14,500 --> 02:59:15,300
Like others...

3835
02:59:15,300 --> 02:59:15,920
And then like...

3836
02:59:15,920 --> 02:59:16,980
But then like to them...

3837
02:59:16,980 --> 02:59:17,400
They would be like...

3838
02:59:17,400 --> 02:59:19,120
Buddy, buddy...

3839
02:59:19,120 --> 02:59:19,980
Yaaay.

3840
02:59:20,500 --> 02:59:21,560
Buddy, buddy...

3841
02:59:21,560 --> 02:59:22,600
And then like...

3842
02:59:23,040 --> 02:59:30,040
And then so it was like... such a... it was such like... it's just too much to handle.

3843
02:59:30,320 --> 02:59:32,280
Yeah, it was just incredibly two-faced.

3844
02:59:32,440 --> 02:59:34,920
And I had like multiple experiences like that.

3845
02:59:35,060 --> 02:59:38,980
Dude, it wasn't like, oh it happened once, and then like, oh I'd never again.

3846
02:59:39,260 --> 02:59:43,520
But it was like... um, it happened multiple times for me.

3847
02:59:43,820 --> 02:59:47,700
And then so that... I have like... that's why I only have like... singular female friends.

3848
02:59:47,780 --> 02:59:49,260
Like not like a group of female friends.

3849
02:59:49,260 --> 02:59:50,680
Other than sloppy sisters, they're fun.

3850
02:59:50,680 --> 02:59:55,240
But also like, they were like three different friends that I had that I brought together in a collab.

3851
02:59:57,600 --> 02:59:58,040
Um...

3852
02:59:58,580 --> 03:00:00,920
Uh... and like... uh...

3853
03:00:00,920 --> 03:00:03,560
But it was like, it was just such a backstabby environment.

3854
03:00:03,720 --> 03:00:06,540
I mean I have like... for male friends, I have a lot of male friends.

3855
03:00:06,960 --> 03:00:09,260
But like a lot of them are also like singular male friends.

3856
03:00:09,440 --> 03:00:11,000
They're not like a group of male friends.

3857
03:00:11,240 --> 03:00:14,460
And it's like... uh...

3858
03:00:15,140 --> 03:00:18,420
Uh... I had less drama involved.

3859
03:00:18,420 --> 03:00:21,040
And it was just cause I... all I do is just game.

3860
03:00:21,280 --> 03:00:21,660
That's it.

3861
03:00:26,460 --> 03:00:28,160
I just... it's just game.

3862
03:00:28,180 --> 03:00:29,380
And we talk about like...

3863
03:00:30,260 --> 03:00:32,820
Like... the drama I hear is not like...

3864
03:00:32,820 --> 03:00:36,600
as mentally draining as the drama I deal with.

3865
03:00:38,760 --> 03:00:40,320
I just want a game.

3866
03:00:40,540 --> 03:00:41,040
That's it.

3867
03:00:41,300 --> 03:00:42,260
I just...

3868
03:00:42,260 --> 03:00:45,380
I just want to play video games and chill.

3869
03:00:45,880 --> 03:00:47,600
I don't want to deal with drama.

3870
03:00:47,920 --> 03:00:48,540
I have...

3871
03:00:48,540 --> 03:00:49,180
I just...

3872
03:00:49,180 --> 03:00:50,220
I'm too stressed out.

3873
03:00:50,620 --> 03:00:51,140
I'm not...

3874
03:00:51,720 --> 03:00:52,500
I'm too...

3875
03:00:55,320 --> 03:00:56,360
I'm too...

3876
03:00:56,360 --> 03:00:57,080
Like...

3877
03:00:57,080 --> 03:00:59,200
The most I hear about like...

3878
03:00:59,200 --> 03:00:59,700
male...

3879
03:00:59,700 --> 03:01:00,540
Like when my...

3880
03:01:01,120 --> 03:01:03,840
When I had like a male group of friends...

3881
03:01:04,620 --> 03:01:05,140
Um...

3882
03:01:05,140 --> 03:01:06,400
From like...

3883
03:01:06,400 --> 03:01:07,340
What was it?

3884
03:01:07,740 --> 03:01:08,400
From like...

3885
03:01:08,400 --> 03:01:11,260
I guess like when I did Gmod and stuff was just like...

3886
03:01:11,260 --> 03:01:12,600
Relationship drama.

3887
03:01:13,340 --> 03:01:14,180
And like...

3888
03:01:14,180 --> 03:01:14,800
That shit...

3889
03:01:14,800 --> 03:01:15,400
I'm like...

3890
03:01:15,400 --> 03:01:15,940
Alright, whatever.

3891
03:01:16,380 --> 03:01:17,640
But like...

3892
03:01:17,640 --> 03:01:18,660
Oh my god.

3893
03:01:18,660 --> 03:01:20,300
It was so mentally draining.

3894
03:01:21,220 --> 03:01:22,460
And then like...

3895
03:01:22,460 --> 03:01:23,100
Okay...

3896
03:01:23,100 --> 03:01:23,540
My...

3897
03:01:23,540 --> 03:01:25,440
The worst experience I ever had...

3898
03:01:25,440 --> 03:01:26,680
Was that...

3899
03:01:26,680 --> 03:01:27,260
Um...

3900
03:01:28,260 --> 03:01:29,160
Oh my god.

3901
03:01:29,260 --> 03:01:29,700
Bro, okay.

3902
03:01:29,940 --> 03:01:30,840
This is so fucked up.

3903
03:01:30,960 --> 03:01:31,660
But this is like...

3904
03:01:31,660 --> 03:01:32,440
Me in high school?

3905
03:01:32,740 --> 03:01:33,980
This is from high school.

3906
03:01:34,360 --> 03:01:34,700
And...

3907
03:01:34,700 --> 03:01:35,880
What happened...

3908
03:01:35,880 --> 03:01:36,730
Was that...

3909
03:01:38,230 --> 03:01:38,750
Uh...

3910
03:01:38,750 --> 03:01:39,730
What happened was that...

3911
03:01:41,570 --> 03:01:42,090
Um...

3912
03:01:42,650 --> 03:01:43,170
Um...

3913
03:01:43,170 --> 03:01:43,510
I...

3914
03:01:43,510 --> 03:01:46,970
I didn't like how one person...

3915
03:01:47,530 --> 03:01:48,050
Was...

3916
03:01:48,050 --> 03:01:48,850
Uh...

3917
03:01:48,850 --> 03:01:49,610
How do I explain it?

3918
03:01:49,650 --> 03:01:50,950
I didn't like how...

3919
03:01:51,630 --> 03:01:52,150
Uh...

3920
03:01:52,150 --> 03:01:52,730
They were...

3921
03:01:54,090 --> 03:01:54,610
Uh...

3922
03:01:54,610 --> 03:01:56,110
Talking back...

3923
03:01:56,110 --> 03:01:56,770
At people.

3924
03:01:57,130 --> 03:01:59,390
And then I told them I didn't like it.

3925
03:01:59,690 --> 03:02:00,650
And I said like...

3926
03:02:00,650 --> 03:02:00,910
Oh...

3927
03:02:02,570 --> 03:02:03,090
Um...

3928
03:02:03,090 --> 03:02:03,770
I...

3929
03:02:03,770 --> 03:02:04,110
Oh my gosh.

3930
03:02:04,130 --> 03:02:05,070
I'm trying to remember what happened.

3931
03:02:05,150 --> 03:02:05,950
Because this was like so...

3932
03:02:05,950 --> 03:02:06,630
It was high school.

3933
03:02:06,630 --> 03:02:07,790
And this is...

3934
03:02:07,790 --> 03:02:08,830
It was like incredibly two-faced.

3935
03:02:08,910 --> 03:02:09,670
And I told her that.

3936
03:02:09,890 --> 03:02:10,970
And then...

3937
03:02:10,970 --> 03:02:11,910
Um...

3938
03:02:11,910 --> 03:02:13,290
And I told her like...

3939
03:02:13,290 --> 03:02:16,150
I don't like how you treat people like this.

3940
03:02:16,330 --> 03:02:17,090
Et cetera, et cetera.

3941
03:02:17,370 --> 03:02:18,370
And then...

3942
03:02:18,370 --> 03:02:19,210
This is like online.

3943
03:02:20,630 --> 03:02:21,110
And...

3944
03:02:21,110 --> 03:02:21,590
Uh...

3945
03:02:21,590 --> 03:02:23,570
And it was like a group of artist friends too.

3946
03:02:24,650 --> 03:02:25,130
And...

3947
03:02:25,130 --> 03:02:26,290
I was like...

3948
03:02:26,290 --> 03:02:28,310
Oh, I don't like how you talk about this...

3949
03:02:28,310 --> 03:02:28,890
About others.

3950
03:02:29,170 --> 03:02:29,650
And...

3951
03:02:29,650 --> 03:02:30,430
Uh...

3952
03:02:30,430 --> 03:02:31,530
And I also...

3953
03:02:31,530 --> 03:02:34,070
Don't like that you do this sometimes.

3954
03:02:34,450 --> 03:02:35,310
And then...

3955
03:02:35,310 --> 03:03:08,730
What she did, she like got in touch with my IRL best friend and then told her that like I was a bitch and I said blah, blah, blah, blah about her and that like and then made some shit up and then my IRL best friend believed her and like and like she contacted my IRL best friend.

3956
03:03:10,670 --> 03:03:14,290
I was like, what the fuck?!

3957
03:03:14,290 --> 03:03:38,090
And like she like got our whole group friend, like the group we had to like go against me because it was like whoever says first and stuff, no like obviously I didn't sell that shit.

3958
03:03:38,670 --> 03:03:57,490
And then like, like okay, and then so like she got told she made up some fucking lies or some shit to like the group of friends that we share and then they obviously, they said all like they believed her and then they all like they all like, and then one of them who has access to one of my,

3959
03:03:57,590 --> 03:04:02,310
I gave her access to like one of my PlayStation accounts back then.

3960
03:04:02,310 --> 03:04:04,250
Like, uh, psn-Network account.

3961
03:04:04,450 --> 03:04:05,830
So she knew that password for it.

3962
03:04:06,030 --> 03:04:08,050
I was stupid and...

3963
03:04:08,050 --> 03:04:27,990
I did oh my god we had triple support ahaha I was dumb and um I was dumb and like didn't...and didn't uh change my twitter password for it I didn't, uh I didn't change my twitter password and share the same password as my twitter password.

3964
03:04:28,190 --> 03:04:29,730
And then she used that.

3965
03:04:30,030 --> 03:04:33,150
And like this was like It's like one of our mutual friends that did it, by the way.

3966
03:04:33,270 --> 03:04:37,110
It wasn't that bitch that did it that reached out to my best friend.

3967
03:04:37,650 --> 03:04:38,030
And then...

3968
03:04:39,390 --> 03:04:41,410
And then the mutual...

3969
03:04:44,110 --> 03:04:45,150
A mutual...

3970
03:04:46,070 --> 03:04:52,450
Like, fucking hacked into my Twitter account, and then tweeted some really fucked up shit?

3971
03:04:53,410 --> 03:04:55,890
And then said like really fucked up shit about me?

3972
03:04:56,210 --> 03:04:59,130
Like, on the Twitter account, pretending to be me.

3973
03:04:59,130 --> 03:05:01,730
And like, not pretending to be me, but be like.

3974
03:05:02,210 --> 03:05:07,770
Oh Doki Bade Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Wah Wah Wah Doki Bade, and I was like W hАt THE FUck?

3975
03:05:07,990 --> 03:05:09,050
Like I was like.

3976
03:05:09,510 --> 03:05:10,730
Holy fuck!

3977
03:05:11,650 --> 03:05:16,770
And like this was not my only bad experience, too.

3978
03:05:17,210 --> 03:05:23,410
Like that was not my only bad experience with ...

3979
03:05:23,960 --> 03:05:25,650
Like, a group of people.

3980
03:05:28,430 --> 03:05:29,470
What's wrong with him?

3981
03:05:31,110 --> 03:05:31,790
Okay.

3982
03:05:35,010 --> 03:05:38,010
Yeah, so, like, I'm a little traumatized about that.

3983
03:05:39,970 --> 03:05:42,770
I'm a little traumatized with that shit, guys.

3984
03:05:43,510 --> 03:05:46,290
What the fuck is going on?

3985
03:05:46,950 --> 03:05:48,230
Alright, I should focus up.

3986
03:05:50,490 --> 03:05:52,090
Oh my god!

3987
03:05:52,590 --> 03:05:54,190
Everyone just died!

3988
03:05:59,210 --> 03:06:03,670
Yeah, I have, like, two or three more experiences with different groups.

3989
03:06:04,650 --> 03:06:07,490
So now I just have, I don't have groups of friends.

3990
03:06:07,710 --> 03:06:11,390
I have, like, I don't do groups of friends anymore.

3991
03:06:15,150 --> 03:06:16,770
You understand why, right?

3992
03:06:21,270 --> 03:06:22,310
I have...

3993
03:06:26,450 --> 03:06:28,630
I don't have groups of friends anymore.

3994
03:06:28,810 --> 03:06:31,770
I have... I have singular friends.

3995
03:06:33,670 --> 03:06:37,830
No, no, we're not... No, and then she became best friends with that other... with that girl.

3996
03:06:40,730 --> 03:06:45,610
Oh my god, Lupa, what are you doing?

3997
03:06:46,430 --> 03:06:47,130
Doesn't matter.

3998
03:06:47,230 --> 03:06:48,010
Shit, it's fine there.

3999
03:06:48,570 --> 03:06:48,610
Oh.

4000
03:06:48,930 --> 03:06:49,350
Oh, no.

4001
03:06:50,390 --> 03:06:51,050
What the fuck?

4002
03:06:51,430 --> 03:06:51,930
I'm trying...

4003
03:06:52,750 --> 03:06:55,290
Yeah, and then she, like, became best friends with her.

4004
03:06:56,190 --> 03:07:01,750
It's cause, like, okay, so, like, what she did... was that I had, like, a... private...

4005
03:07:01,750 --> 03:07:05,730
um, vent Tumblr account back then.

4006
03:07:08,450 --> 03:07:17,270
And, um, and, like, she... I was venting about something that was unrelated to my IRL best friend.

4007
03:07:17,590 --> 03:07:24,190
And then, like, she, like, took that screenshot and, like, told my IRL best friend that it was about her.

4008
03:07:27,090 --> 03:07:28,270
That's what she did.

4009
03:07:30,690 --> 03:07:34,690
I think we can see you all at first, and then we can save, uh, Mantis for last.

4010
03:07:34,710 --> 03:07:37,310
Oh, that, yeah, like, that's traumatized shit, right?

4011
03:07:37,650 --> 03:07:39,610
That's fucking crazy shit, right?

4012
03:07:40,030 --> 03:07:42,470
Like, like, what the fuck?

4013
03:07:50,330 --> 03:07:52,150
Cause, obviously, like...

4014
03:08:00,690 --> 03:08:03,430
I'm trying not to do something crazy right now.

4015
03:08:04,910 --> 03:08:06,610
I know they have...

4016
03:08:09,990 --> 03:08:11,030
Oh, okay.

4017
03:08:13,890 --> 03:08:14,530
Cool.

4018
03:08:18,310 --> 03:08:18,950
Okay,

4019
03:08:22,470 --> 03:08:22,690
nice.

4020
03:08:28,610 --> 03:08:29,730
Nice, I got him.

4021
03:08:30,390 --> 03:08:31,030
Oh my god.

4022
03:08:35,670 --> 03:08:37,250
Alright, nice.

4023
03:08:37,590 --> 03:08:38,490
Alright, so that's why.

4024
03:08:39,070 --> 03:08:49,350
I just, like, my lesson for myself that day was that I just, just have, like, I have, like, singular friends, not, like, friend groups anywhere after that.

4025
03:08:50,630 --> 03:08:54,350
That's why I also have, like, insane trust issues, too.

4026
03:08:58,570 --> 03:09:02,890
Cause, like, like, you'd think, like, I've only, that happened to me, like, once.

4027
03:09:03,130 --> 03:09:09,090
But, like, the worst part is that this happened to me, like, at least two more times.

4028
03:09:09,390 --> 03:09:11,630
From, like, different groups of friends.

4029
03:09:15,590 --> 03:09:18,890
And they've all been, like, equally traumatizing.

4030
03:09:19,290 --> 03:09:20,350
Oh my god, no.

4031
03:09:21,190 --> 03:09:23,370
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

4032
03:09:25,410 --> 03:09:26,710
You're fucking kidding me for all love.

4033
03:09:26,750 --> 03:09:27,530
I'm not getting from love.

4034
03:09:27,550 --> 03:09:28,070
I have no supports.

4035
03:09:28,930 --> 03:09:29,670
Oh my god.

4036
03:09:30,390 --> 03:09:31,910
I literally couldn't press Q.

4037
03:09:32,950 --> 03:09:33,830
That's Ashley, fuck.

4038
03:09:34,510 --> 03:09:35,650
Skelectus ulted nothing, bro.

4039
03:09:35,850 --> 03:09:36,470
She ulted nothing.

4040
03:09:37,230 --> 03:09:37,990
She's 1-H plan.

4041
03:09:38,410 --> 03:09:38,990
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4042
03:09:39,090 --> 03:09:39,970
We're TPing, we're TPing.

4043
03:09:40,530 --> 03:09:40,890
Oh.

4044
03:09:42,050 --> 03:09:43,150
I realize we're TPing.

4045
03:09:43,450 --> 03:09:44,990
Hey, maybe we should wait until we're all ready.

4046
03:09:45,070 --> 03:09:46,110
Yeah, I'm waiting, I'm waiting, I'm waiting, I'm waiting.

4047
03:09:46,210 --> 03:09:46,870
Wait till we're all ready.

4048
03:09:47,110 --> 03:09:47,550
Alright, alright.

4049
03:09:47,810 --> 03:09:48,850
I'm doing a bug, ready?

4050
03:09:49,110 --> 03:09:50,650
Three, two, one, above a bug.

4051
03:09:54,410 --> 03:09:55,890
Oh, fuck, okay.

4052
03:09:56,810 --> 03:09:58,710
I remember you on the right one.

4053
03:09:59,670 --> 03:10:00,110
Okay.

4054
03:10:02,870 --> 03:10:04,170
There we go, that was worth it.

4055
03:10:04,430 --> 03:10:05,850
That was fucking worth it.

4056
03:10:06,370 --> 03:10:09,770
I literally killed two from that.

4057
03:10:10,230 --> 03:10:11,450
That was so worth it.

4058
03:10:11,830 --> 03:10:13,010
I literally clutched for that.

4059
03:10:13,010 --> 03:10:16,890
The floor is... zero... two... zero...

4060
03:10:16,890 --> 03:10:19,470
Time to switch things up.

4061
03:10:19,870 --> 03:10:21,530
Including which side you're on.

4062
03:10:21,570 --> 03:10:24,190
Yeah, I killed the Luna and also the Hawkeye with that look.

4063
03:10:24,450 --> 03:10:26,570
Life energy is a powerful weapon against evil.

4064
03:10:26,790 --> 03:10:29,070
You'll need a tough-notch team to win this one.

4065
03:10:33,220 --> 03:10:33,700
I...

4066
03:10:41,630 --> 03:10:45,790
Yeah, that's why, like, for me, I learned a lot from that type of experience.

4067
03:10:46,370 --> 03:10:47,030
I don't know.

4068
03:10:47,190 --> 03:10:48,790
I just... groups is, like...

4069
03:10:49,550 --> 03:10:51,150
There's just too much dynamics for me.

4070
03:10:52,110 --> 03:10:55,690
That's why I have a small... that's why you guys might notice I have a very small group of friends.

4071
03:10:56,550 --> 03:10:59,790
And majority of it is just, like, like, two to three.

4072
03:11:00,270 --> 03:11:02,150
Like, I don't have, like, big groups of friends.

4073
03:11:02,390 --> 03:11:03,750
Cause it's just... or, like, one.

4074
03:11:04,530 --> 03:11:06,490
I like one-to-one interactions.

4075
03:11:07,430 --> 03:11:10,390
I like one-to-one interactions.

4076
03:11:10,910 --> 03:11:12,490
More than, uh...

4077
03:11:13,430 --> 03:11:15,530
More than, like, group interactions in general.

4078
03:11:15,950 --> 03:11:17,110
I see this great sadness in you.

4079
03:11:18,750 --> 03:11:20,710
Like, that's just, like, my personal experience.

4080
03:11:21,590 --> 03:11:24,710
Cause one-to-one interactions, that's why I have, like, a small group of friends.

4081
03:11:24,990 --> 03:11:28,630
Or, like, a small circle of... I won't say groups.

4082
03:11:28,630 --> 03:11:32,910
Or, like, more can... more, like, a smaller circle of friends.

4083
03:11:33,210 --> 03:11:34,970
Just cause, like...

4084
03:11:34,970 --> 03:11:37,130
I like keeping, like, a tighter...

4085
03:11:37,130 --> 03:11:38,950
Like, tighter...

4086
03:11:40,770 --> 03:11:41,290
Um...

4087
03:11:41,290 --> 03:11:41,490
What?

4088
03:11:45,290 --> 03:11:47,050
Like, a tighter circle...

4089
03:11:47,050 --> 03:11:48,710
A circle of friends that I trust.

4090
03:11:49,250 --> 03:11:50,050
Oh, hold on.

4091
03:11:50,330 --> 03:11:50,350
Oh, hold on.

4092
03:11:50,350 --> 03:11:50,930
Okay, I should focus.

4093
03:11:51,490 --> 03:11:52,130
Well, hello.

4094
03:11:53,030 --> 03:11:53,930
Every time...

4095
03:11:53,930 --> 03:11:54,490
Uh...

4096
03:11:54,490 --> 03:11:55,890
Cannot play DPS.

4097
03:11:56,710 --> 03:11:57,190
Like...

4098
03:11:57,190 --> 03:11:57,850
He struggles.

4099
03:11:58,910 --> 03:12:00,430
He's actually a really...

4100
03:12:00,430 --> 03:12:01,990
He's really, really good at...

4101
03:12:03,940 --> 03:12:06,110
He's really, really good at...

4102
03:12:07,250 --> 03:12:07,910
Non...

4103
03:12:07,910 --> 03:12:09,070
Non-tanks.

4104
03:12:10,730 --> 03:12:12,190
Oh, that was a...

4105
03:12:14,150 --> 03:12:15,010
That's crazy.

4106
03:12:15,330 --> 03:12:15,770
We're down one.

4107
03:12:15,970 --> 03:12:16,190
We're down one.

4108
03:12:16,330 --> 03:12:17,990
I'm trying to heal.

4109
03:12:24,390 --> 03:12:25,050
Nice.

4110
03:12:25,850 --> 03:12:27,170
Okay, nice.

4111
03:12:32,220 --> 03:12:32,700
Yeah.

4112
03:12:33,180 --> 03:12:33,660
I'm...

4113
03:12:33,660 --> 03:12:35,260
I'm more about, like...

4114
03:12:36,200 --> 03:12:37,620
More about, like...

4115
03:12:38,200 --> 03:12:38,680
Uh...

4116
03:12:38,680 --> 03:12:39,500
Oh, what the fuck?

4117
03:12:42,000 --> 03:12:43,140
That's the real one.

4118
03:12:47,940 --> 03:12:49,560
Yeah, I have, like, acquaintances...

4119
03:12:51,080 --> 03:12:51,560
Like...

4120
03:12:52,300 --> 03:12:52,780
People...

4121
03:12:52,780 --> 03:12:53,640
Uh...

4122
03:12:54,140 --> 03:12:54,620
Colleagues...

4123
03:12:54,620 --> 03:12:55,840
And, like, you know...

4124
03:12:55,840 --> 03:12:55,980
Yeah.

4125
03:12:56,720 --> 03:12:57,080
Yeah.

4126
03:13:00,250 --> 03:13:01,890
No, we are definitely not top 500.

4127
03:13:01,990 --> 03:13:03,890
I think I need, like, one, two to three more games.

4128
03:13:12,600 --> 03:13:12,960
Yeah!

4129
03:13:14,340 --> 03:13:16,100
I don't know what the fuck that game was.

4130
03:13:16,240 --> 03:13:17,480
That game was so weird.

4131
03:13:18,220 --> 03:13:19,400
Windows is a tank player.

4132
03:13:19,580 --> 03:13:21,420
So, I don't know why he was on Iron Man.

4133
03:13:24,910 --> 03:13:25,970
I have no idea.

4134
03:13:27,230 --> 03:13:28,010
Oh, that's funny.

4135
03:13:28,010 --> 03:13:29,170
I did not do a lot of damage.

4136
03:13:29,930 --> 03:13:31,990
I was not doing damage.

4137
03:13:34,490 --> 03:13:35,530
As Mantis...

4138
03:13:36,250 --> 03:13:36,770
My...

4139
03:13:36,770 --> 03:13:38,290
My Luna and Invis...

4140
03:13:38,730 --> 03:13:40,550
To be fair, I was distracted too.

4141
03:13:40,970 --> 03:13:43,010
I was like, we have two supports.

4142
03:13:43,310 --> 03:13:44,650
We're running triple supports.

4143
03:13:44,650 --> 03:13:46,050
I don't need to heal as much.

4144
03:13:46,390 --> 03:13:46,730
I...

4145
03:13:47,970 --> 03:13:50,090
I don't need to do as much, guys.

4146
03:13:50,230 --> 03:13:51,470
I have triple support.

4147
03:13:51,670 --> 03:13:53,450
It's literally having a conversation.

4148
03:13:58,820 --> 03:13:59,440
Like...

4149
03:13:59,440 --> 03:14:00,020
It's fine.

4150
03:14:00,720 --> 03:14:01,140
Three...

4151
03:14:01,140 --> 03:14:02,840
The other two can pick up the slack.

4152
03:14:03,500 --> 03:14:03,840
They...

4153
03:14:03,840 --> 03:14:04,760
They can...

4154
03:14:05,760 --> 03:14:06,760
They can...

4155
03:14:06,760 --> 03:14:08,300
They can do the rest for me.

4156
03:14:15,380 --> 03:14:16,000
Alright.

4157
03:14:16,400 --> 03:14:17,580
It's time for our...

4158
03:14:17,580 --> 03:14:18,540
RPs.

4159
03:14:19,020 --> 03:14:20,380
I love roleplay.

4160
03:14:21,580 --> 03:14:24,280
When will we have our custom roleplay lobbies?

4161
03:14:24,440 --> 03:14:25,360
Just like in...

4162
03:14:25,360 --> 03:14:26,720
In Overwatch.

4163
03:14:29,780 --> 03:14:30,870
Where are my roleplayers?

4164
03:14:32,840 --> 03:14:33,980
Oh my god.

4165
03:14:34,540 --> 03:14:35,180
Is this a...

4166
03:14:35,180 --> 03:14:36,640
I didn't queue up dude.

4167
03:14:36,820 --> 03:14:37,580
Oh wait, there it is.

4168
03:14:38,040 --> 03:14:39,860
Hello, my roleplayers.

4169
03:14:40,740 --> 03:14:42,940
Hello, my fellow roleplayers.

4170
03:14:47,860 --> 03:14:48,540
Hello.

4171
03:14:52,560 --> 03:14:54,940
Hello, how do you do, fellow RPrs.

4172
03:14:56,580 --> 03:14:58,280
You know like in Overwatch.

4173
03:14:58,660 --> 03:14:59,440
What the...

4174
03:14:59,440 --> 03:15:00,420
What did I do wrong?

4175
03:15:00,600 --> 03:15:00,960
No.

4176
03:15:01,380 --> 03:15:02,780
He's not a roleplayer.

4177
03:15:03,020 --> 03:15:04,420
Somebody stop him.

4178
03:15:08,040 --> 03:15:10,200
I can't believe it.

4179
03:15:10,200 --> 03:15:10,240
Shit!

4180
03:15:14,480 --> 03:15:17,100
I can't believe they would do such a thing!

4181
03:15:20,160 --> 03:15:22,320
Hello everybody, I'm still roleplaying.

4182
03:15:24,300 --> 03:15:29,560
Okay, anyway, as I was saying, in Overwatch custom lobbies... Okay, get rid of this guy.

4183
03:15:29,680 --> 03:15:30,780
This guy is not a roleplayer.

4184
03:15:31,580 --> 03:15:32,200
We gotta leave.

4185
03:15:33,300 --> 03:15:34,120
Get him out.

4186
03:15:34,880 --> 03:15:35,740
Get him out.

4187
03:15:39,220 --> 03:15:40,480
Like, are you stupid?

4188
03:15:44,200 --> 03:15:45,640
I'm so... No.

4189
03:15:46,620 --> 03:15:47,820
Don't do this to me.

4190
03:15:47,900 --> 03:15:49,020
I try to defend us.

4191
03:15:49,520 --> 03:15:56,440
I try to defend us from... From... From the guy ruining our RP.

4192
03:15:58,140 --> 03:15:58,520
Yeah!

4193
03:16:00,160 --> 03:16:01,180
What was I saying?

4194
03:16:01,540 --> 03:16:07,220
Oh yeah, in Overwatch custom lobbies... They have a feature where... Oh my gosh.

4195
03:16:07,500 --> 03:16:10,180
They have a feature where you can make custom lobbies, yeah?

4196
03:16:10,180 --> 03:16:14,560
And then... There's like a... Sometimes I like, check what they have.

4197
03:16:14,980 --> 03:16:16,860
And they have this thing called Tinder Watch.

4198
03:16:17,240 --> 03:16:25,080
Where like, people... People actually try to... Find their significant other... Via Overwatch.

4199
03:16:25,460 --> 03:16:32,620
And it's actually... It's actually... Real... Dating... Like a real dating lobby.

4200
03:16:33,380 --> 03:16:35,400
Not Tinder Watch.

4201
03:16:38,040 --> 03:16:40,000
Stop calling me.

4202
03:16:40,000 --> 03:16:40,220
Yeah.

4203
03:16:41,880 --> 03:16:44,020
No, I told you guys about this before.

4204
03:16:44,600 --> 03:16:45,600
No, it's crazy.

4205
03:16:45,940 --> 03:16:47,500
I still think it's fucking funny.

4206
03:16:52,390 --> 03:16:54,630
Which hero do you think you want to be today?

4207
03:16:58,290 --> 03:17:03,490
As someone who plays Overwatch, I never marry someone who plays Overwatch.

4208
03:17:05,390 --> 03:17:06,730
Oh, it's this Twitch guy.

4209
03:17:07,090 --> 03:17:08,630
Um... Everyone's over fantastic.

4210
03:17:08,970 --> 03:17:11,010
Who am I gonna banish from this match?

4211
03:17:11,150 --> 03:17:12,630
Show me your fantastic dude.

4212
03:17:13,510 --> 03:17:14,030
No.

4213
03:17:15,750 --> 03:17:16,670
That's awkward.

4214
03:17:16,930 --> 03:17:17,130
No.

4215
03:17:17,130 --> 03:17:17,130
No.

4216
03:17:17,130 --> 03:17:17,130
No.

4217
03:17:17,130 --> 03:17:17,130
No.

4218
03:17:17,130 --> 03:17:17,130
No.

4219
03:17:17,130 --> 03:17:17,130
That's awkward.

4220
03:17:17,130 --> 03:17:17,130
Wow!

4221
03:17:17,470 --> 03:17:17,670
Mm.

4222
03:17:17,770 --> 03:17:26,950
That's awkward, guys... on the enhymean torch.

4223
03:17:27,590 --> 03:17:29,510
Hey, you can... You can vouch for me, right?

4224
03:17:29,650 --> 03:17:31,890
Like... Like I deserve the fantastic here, right?

4225
03:17:33,730 --> 03:17:34,750
You're in this game of Latin?

4226
03:17:34,850 --> 03:17:36,270
Not... Not this season.

4227
03:17:36,590 --> 03:17:37,150
Last season?

4228
03:17:37,190 --> 03:17:37,490
Yeah.

4229
03:17:37,650 --> 03:17:38,370
Not this season.

4230
03:17:39,210 --> 03:17:40,910
I've been... I've been playing less this season.

4231
03:17:41,310 --> 03:17:42,370
No idea.

4232
03:17:44,430 --> 03:17:45,330
No idea.

4233
03:17:47,110 --> 03:17:47,950
Alright, man.

4234
03:17:49,510 --> 03:17:50,270
I'm still getting it now.

4235
03:17:52,070 --> 03:17:53,210
Still getting it?

4236
03:17:53,350 --> 03:17:54,290
Well, something's a bit kinky.

4237
03:17:55,830 --> 03:17:56,430
Except today.

4238
03:17:57,290 --> 03:18:01,730
Today I just... Today I just like... I got... I don't know.

4239
03:18:01,850 --> 03:18:02,830
I just feel like it.

4240
03:18:02,970 --> 03:18:05,110
I just felt like rivals today.

4241
03:18:06,770 --> 03:18:08,610
I just feel extra rival-y.

4242
03:18:09,790 --> 03:18:11,370
Guys, do we have a tank player?

4243
03:18:12,390 --> 03:18:12,750
Yeah.

4244
03:18:12,750 --> 03:18:14,470
Surely we have a tank player, right?

4245
03:18:14,990 --> 03:18:16,630
For all these Mr. Fantastics?

4246
03:18:17,910 --> 03:18:18,270
Surely...

4247
03:18:18,270 --> 03:18:19,670
No, I didn't ban him.

4248
03:18:19,670 --> 03:18:20,210
I didn't ban him.

4249
03:18:20,650 --> 03:18:21,490
The group guy.

4250
03:18:21,730 --> 03:18:22,810
It was the same group guy.

4251
03:18:23,450 --> 03:18:24,950
Surely... Can I have my Fantastica?

4252
03:18:25,450 --> 03:18:26,890
Like, actually, I am on one trick.

4253
03:18:27,170 --> 03:18:28,210
Please let me have my Fantastica.

4254
03:18:30,690 --> 03:18:32,570
But if he's actually on one trick as well.

4255
03:18:32,750 --> 03:18:33,750
But are you both on tics?

4256
03:18:36,410 --> 03:18:37,690
But I'm like, unwashing.

4257
03:18:37,910 --> 03:18:38,610
Like, I need it.

4258
03:18:39,870 --> 03:18:41,370
Like, I'm slursing at the helo.

4259
03:18:41,490 --> 03:18:42,350
Please let me have my...

4260
03:18:42,350 --> 03:18:43,850
Oh my god.

4261
03:18:45,590 --> 03:18:47,790
This is actually tragic.

4262
03:18:48,010 --> 03:18:49,250
I've never seen the Fantastica.

4263
03:18:49,250 --> 03:18:50,170
Does anyone have a tank?

4264
03:18:50,490 --> 03:18:52,070
Does anyone have... Can anyone play tank?

4265
03:18:52,350 --> 03:18:53,670
Oh my god.

4266
03:18:53,830 --> 03:18:57,950
This is so sad.

4267
03:18:58,650 --> 03:19:04,710
This is so sad.

4268
03:19:04,710 --> 03:19:06,970
This is so sad.

4269
03:19:07,410 --> 03:19:07,410
This is so sad.

4270
03:19:07,410 --> 03:19:11,050
We have a tool of a guy banking his heart out.

4271
03:19:11,570 --> 03:19:14,130
This dude, he's GM, too.

4272
03:19:16,170 --> 03:19:17,610
Oh my god.

4273
03:19:19,670 --> 03:19:24,070
Why are you one tricking at 3.30 in the morning?

4274
03:19:24,410 --> 03:19:25,590
No, this is East Coast server.

4275
03:19:25,810 --> 03:19:29,550
Why are you one tricking at 6 AM in the morning?

4276
03:19:30,470 --> 03:19:31,390
He's dead in voice.

4277
03:19:31,530 --> 03:19:32,570
You shouldn't have tried typing.

4278
03:19:32,770 --> 03:19:33,330
He's dead in voice.

4279
03:19:34,070 --> 03:19:41,330
And it's like, not even like, you know, uh... Not even like, a good one trick, too.

4280
03:19:45,920 --> 03:19:48,880
Oh, he went... He went into... Diamond form.

4281
03:19:51,580 --> 03:19:52,160
Okay.

4282
03:19:55,440 --> 03:19:56,320
That's fine.

4283
03:19:56,600 --> 03:19:58,100
Oh, that is not fine.

4284
03:20:00,120 --> 03:20:00,820
That's true.

4285
03:20:01,440 --> 03:20:02,880
That's not fine anymore.

4286
03:20:04,680 --> 03:20:06,200
I think he's gonna die.

4287
03:20:06,520 --> 03:20:08,420
Guys, we need a Loki.

4288
03:20:08,860 --> 03:20:09,400
We need a Loki.

4289
03:20:09,760 --> 03:20:10,360
Do we?

4290
03:20:10,360 --> 03:20:12,580
Like, like... Oh, you got fun.

4291
03:20:12,600 --> 03:20:12,620
Yes.

4292
03:20:12,620 --> 03:20:13,820
Because we're all grouped together.

4293
03:20:14,000 --> 03:20:14,820
Loki will fuck.

4294
03:20:15,100 --> 03:20:15,760
He just...

4295
03:20:15,760 --> 03:20:16,760
And then he heals.

4296
03:20:17,080 --> 03:20:18,060
Well, I have shit, though.

4297
03:20:18,380 --> 03:20:18,860
Yeah, shit.

4298
03:20:19,180 --> 03:20:19,180
Hello?

4299
03:20:19,620 --> 03:20:20,080
Oh my god.

4300
03:20:21,300 --> 03:20:23,140
I won't disappear so easily.

4301
03:20:24,540 --> 03:20:25,860
Um, that's actually not the cooldown.

4302
03:20:26,720 --> 03:20:28,180
Oh my god.

4303
03:20:29,760 --> 03:20:30,740
Oh my god.

4304
03:20:30,740 --> 03:20:31,320
Oh my god.

4305
03:20:32,500 --> 03:20:32,640
Oh my god.

4306
03:20:32,640 --> 03:20:32,860
Oh my god.

4307
03:20:33,320 --> 03:20:37,140
Oh my god.

4308
03:20:38,400 --> 03:20:38,880
Oh my god.

4309
03:20:38,880 --> 03:20:40,380
Shush GM players.

4310
03:20:41,360 --> 03:20:43,420
Bro, bro, thank you for the raid!

4311
03:20:44,320 --> 03:20:45,100
Thank you, thank you.

4312
03:20:45,220 --> 03:20:46,160
Were you doing, uh...

4313
03:20:46,160 --> 03:20:46,520
What was it?

4314
03:20:46,600 --> 03:20:47,140
I know Japan.

4315
03:20:47,400 --> 03:20:48,220
Were you...

4316
03:20:48,900 --> 03:20:49,380
Watching...

4317
03:20:49,380 --> 03:20:52,020
Were you, uh, watching the...

4318
03:20:52,620 --> 03:20:53,100
JP...

4319
03:20:53,840 --> 03:20:55,020
Street Fighter tournament?

4320
03:20:55,440 --> 03:20:56,260
Yeah, EVO Japan.

4321
03:20:56,580 --> 03:20:57,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4322
03:21:00,960 --> 03:21:01,920
Oh my...

4323
03:21:02,520 --> 03:21:03,000
Um...

4324
03:21:03,000 --> 03:21:04,160
Games have...

4325
03:21:05,780 --> 03:21:06,260
Um...

4326
03:21:08,060 --> 03:21:08,660
Game...

4327
03:21:08,660 --> 03:21:09,520
This game...

4328
03:21:09,520 --> 03:21:10,640
I'll just say...

4329
03:21:10,640 --> 03:21:10,860
It's...

4330
03:21:10,860 --> 03:21:11,820
It's just this game.

4331
03:21:12,040 --> 03:21:13,260
It's just this game.

4332
03:21:13,420 --> 03:21:14,180
It's just this game.

4333
03:21:14,480 --> 03:21:14,720
It's...

4334
03:21:14,720 --> 03:21:16,000
Oh my god.

4335
03:21:16,540 --> 03:21:17,140
I...

4336
03:21:18,800 --> 03:21:19,400
Okay.

4337
03:21:19,640 --> 03:21:22,020
I know games might look rough right now.

4338
03:21:22,180 --> 03:21:24,440
But like, literally, it's just this game.

4339
03:21:24,760 --> 03:21:25,080
We...

4340
03:21:25,080 --> 03:21:26,060
We had...

4341
03:21:26,060 --> 03:21:27,060
Three...

4342
03:21:27,060 --> 03:21:27,960
We had...

4343
03:21:27,960 --> 03:21:28,940
Zero take players.

4344
03:21:29,440 --> 03:21:30,040
And...

4345
03:21:30,040 --> 03:21:31,180
Two...

4346
03:21:31,180 --> 03:21:32,800
Mr. Fantastic one tricks.

4347
03:21:33,040 --> 03:21:34,080
Which is crazy.

4348
03:21:34,080 --> 03:21:35,000
Cause like...

4349
03:21:35,000 --> 03:21:36,380
In what world...

4350
03:21:36,380 --> 03:21:37,180
Do we have two...

4351
03:21:37,820 --> 03:21:39,440
Mr. Fantastic one tricks?

4352
03:21:40,280 --> 03:21:40,840
Like...

4353
03:21:40,840 --> 03:21:41,020
I mean...

4354
03:21:41,020 --> 03:21:41,640
In this one.

4355
03:21:41,960 --> 03:21:43,060
I like...

4356
03:21:43,060 --> 03:21:43,320
Like...

4357
03:21:43,320 --> 03:21:44,480
The highest one in the game.

4358
03:21:44,720 --> 03:21:45,280
But...

4359
03:21:47,600 --> 03:21:48,700
It's Celestial 2.

4360
03:21:48,860 --> 03:21:49,680
I'm Celestial 1.

4361
03:21:50,060 --> 03:21:50,960
Thanks so much.

4362
03:21:51,460 --> 03:21:51,780
There you go.

4363
03:21:51,880 --> 03:21:52,820
It's just an hour.

4364
03:21:53,460 --> 03:21:54,300
I don't even know.

4365
03:21:55,240 --> 03:21:55,800
I'm...

4366
03:21:57,320 --> 03:21:57,880
I'm...

4367
03:21:57,880 --> 03:21:57,960
I'm...

4368
03:21:57,960 --> 03:21:58,200
I'm only...

4369
03:21:58,200 --> 03:21:59,040
I mean...

4370
03:21:59,040 --> 03:21:59,560
Don't worry.

4371
03:21:59,560 --> 03:22:00,640
I just have a focus.

4372
03:22:00,660 --> 03:22:00,780
Oh yeah.

4373
03:22:01,040 --> 03:22:04,360
I came from YouTube where I streamed 12 hours.

4374
03:22:05,360 --> 03:22:06,420
Oh my god.

4375
03:22:08,920 --> 03:22:09,280
Yeah.

4376
03:22:09,500 --> 03:22:09,780
This is...

4377
03:22:09,780 --> 03:22:10,580
Yo what the fuck are we doing really?

4378
03:22:10,720 --> 03:22:12,100
You're just seeing a choke and nothing's alright.

4379
03:22:13,720 --> 03:22:14,860
This is a little awkward.

4380
03:22:16,300 --> 03:22:17,120
Oh my god.

4381
03:22:17,440 --> 03:22:18,520
This is very awkward.

4382
03:22:18,900 --> 03:22:19,800
This is real firepower.

4383
03:22:21,200 --> 03:22:23,980
Anyway, we have nothing to force ult so I'm literally useless.

4384
03:22:24,460 --> 03:22:27,420
Did you just say you might be the worst Mr. Fantastic player?

4385
03:22:27,980 --> 03:22:28,500
Like...

4386
03:22:28,500 --> 03:22:31,100
How would the other Mr. I'm going here.

4387
03:22:31,100 --> 03:22:31,680
Oh my god.

4388
03:22:31,900 --> 03:22:33,100
You're Mr. Fantastic.

4389
03:22:34,340 --> 03:22:35,000
Oh my god.

4390
03:22:36,900 --> 03:22:38,080
Here they are now.

4391
03:22:38,840 --> 03:22:39,360
Alright.

4392
03:22:39,540 --> 03:22:40,700
Goodbye Brawl Pro.

4393
03:22:41,880 --> 03:22:42,640
That was a roll.

4394
03:22:42,920 --> 03:22:43,320
Yeah.

4395
03:22:43,580 --> 03:22:44,100
They're...

4396
03:22:44,100 --> 03:22:46,300
They're comparing rank as if it's like...

4397
03:22:46,300 --> 03:22:47,540
We have a piece of problems.

4398
03:22:48,740 --> 03:22:50,020
Who uses ult first?

4399
03:22:50,200 --> 03:22:51,300
I don't know.

4400
03:22:51,500 --> 03:22:52,120
I don't know.

4401
03:22:52,220 --> 03:22:52,440
I don't know.

4402
03:22:53,800 --> 03:22:54,320
That...

4403
03:22:55,040 --> 03:22:56,240
That is awkward.

4404
03:22:58,120 --> 03:22:58,600
That...

4405
03:22:58,600 --> 03:22:59,100
That is awkward.

4406
03:22:59,380 --> 03:22:59,800
That...

4407
03:23:01,180 --> 03:23:02,560
That is awkward.

4408
03:23:03,280 --> 03:23:03,760
That...

4409
03:23:03,760 --> 03:23:05,560
I didn't think he was gonna...

4410
03:23:06,700 --> 03:23:07,380
Oh my god.

4411
03:23:07,580 --> 03:23:08,480
Please, Luna.

4412
03:23:08,920 --> 03:23:09,400
Please.

4413
03:23:10,380 --> 03:23:10,860
Yeah.

4414
03:23:10,920 --> 03:23:14,980
This was actually a GG on, uh...

4415
03:23:14,980 --> 03:23:15,220
Yeah.

4416
03:23:15,300 --> 03:23:16,660
I got the rocket on the Punisher.

4417
03:23:16,900 --> 03:23:19,300
GG on character select, unfortunately.

4418
03:23:19,580 --> 03:23:20,160
I'm on the low key.

4419
03:23:20,260 --> 03:23:20,780
I'm on the low key.

4420
03:23:20,880 --> 03:23:21,700
Don't have good the low key.

4421
03:23:22,560 --> 03:23:23,840
Don't worry, Rigsy.

4422
03:23:23,840 --> 03:23:24,720
I got you.

4423
03:23:24,720 --> 03:23:24,760
Just gonna kill you.

4424
03:23:28,180 --> 03:23:29,100
Oh my god.

4425
03:23:29,380 --> 03:23:30,380
We have to play more.

4426
03:23:30,600 --> 03:23:33,160
Aw mercy, I told you we're on DPS or we won't lose it.

4427
03:23:33,280 --> 03:23:33,920
I'm such a silly boy...

4428
03:23:33,920 --> 03:23:34,560
Oh my god!

4429
03:23:34,860 --> 03:23:36,900
We have to play more.

4430
03:23:38,200 --> 03:23:38,640
We...

4431
03:23:38,640 --> 03:23:39,060
Changed.

4432
03:23:44,210 --> 03:23:45,450
Oh my god.

4433
03:23:45,450 --> 03:23:46,750
Oh!

4434
03:23:47,950 --> 03:23:48,690
Oh!

4435
03:23:51,710 --> 03:23:52,510
How?

4436
03:23:53,710 --> 03:23:54,510
How?

4437
03:23:55,290 --> 03:23:56,090
How?

4438
03:23:58,950 --> 03:24:01,110
Please tell me someone's on Strange.

4439
03:24:01,790 --> 03:24:01,950
Oh!

4440
03:24:03,250 --> 03:24:09,290
The current score is...

4441
03:24:09,290 --> 03:24:09,910
Thank God.

4442
03:24:11,150 --> 03:24:12,670
Thank God, guys.

4443
03:24:13,070 --> 03:24:14,510
Alright, so I have to...

4444
03:24:14,510 --> 03:24:16,270
Time to avoid both...

4445
03:24:16,270 --> 03:24:18,630
Mr. Fantastic players.

4446
03:24:23,690 --> 03:24:25,210
Alright, let's go.

4447
03:24:25,230 --> 03:24:26,790
We can avoid both...

4448
03:24:26,790 --> 03:24:28,530
Mr. Fantastic players.

4449
03:24:28,690 --> 03:24:29,170
Let's go!

4450
03:24:32,610 --> 03:24:33,950
Oh my God.

4451
03:24:35,350 --> 03:24:35,730
Yeah.

4452
03:24:36,270 --> 03:24:37,410
I'm solo tanking now.

4453
03:24:37,830 --> 03:24:39,050
I think it's just...

4454
03:24:39,050 --> 03:24:41,990
Awkward when...

4455
03:24:41,990 --> 03:24:43,750
I think it's not awkward.

4456
03:24:46,190 --> 03:24:46,750
Please...

4457
03:24:48,210 --> 03:24:48,770
Please...

4458
03:24:48,770 --> 03:24:49,690
Oh...

4459
03:24:49,690 --> 03:24:50,650
So...

4460
03:24:50,650 --> 03:24:53,210
I play Luna, but like, I'm not the greatest Luna.

4461
03:24:53,530 --> 03:24:54,730
Oh, he hides!

4462
03:24:56,370 --> 03:24:57,990
He's like not even...

4463
03:24:57,990 --> 03:24:59,430
How are you a fucking one trick man?

4464
03:24:59,590 --> 03:25:00,370
You don't play...

4465
03:25:00,370 --> 03:25:02,470
I was rank 151 tricking, okay?

4466
03:25:02,670 --> 03:25:03,790
Just let me play my hero.

4467
03:25:04,630 --> 03:25:05,650
I was rank...

4468
03:25:05,650 --> 03:25:06,430
Dude, I can't control that, brother.

4469
03:25:06,810 --> 03:25:09,410
I was rank 150...

4470
03:25:09,410 --> 03:25:11,670
What, in the beginning of the season?

4471
03:25:12,510 --> 03:25:12,950
Like...

4472
03:25:13,910 --> 03:25:14,790
I just...

4473
03:25:14,790 --> 03:25:16,270
I'm just wondering, like...

4474
03:25:16,270 --> 03:25:16,790
Is that even...

4475
03:25:16,790 --> 03:25:17,710
Okay, okay.

4476
03:25:17,710 --> 03:25:19,170
People who are like...

4477
03:25:19,170 --> 03:25:20,010
Not even...

4478
03:25:20,630 --> 03:25:21,110
Like...

4479
03:25:21,110 --> 03:25:21,710
Like...

4480
03:25:21,710 --> 03:25:24,030
I have a command where I tell what my peak rank is.

4481
03:25:24,250 --> 03:25:24,950
But like...

4482
03:25:24,950 --> 03:25:25,470
You don't understand.

4483
03:25:25,550 --> 03:25:29,330
In the beginning of the season, it's so easy to get high peaks.

4484
03:25:29,730 --> 03:25:30,390
Because like...

4485
03:25:30,690 --> 03:25:32,270
I'm just good at my character, okay?

4486
03:25:32,410 --> 03:25:33,350
It is...

4487
03:25:34,010 --> 03:25:34,410
Like...

4488
03:25:34,410 --> 03:25:35,390
People who put on the stream title...

4489
03:25:36,050 --> 03:25:36,830
Be like...

4490
03:25:37,450 --> 03:25:37,850
Um...

4491
03:25:37,850 --> 03:25:38,550
I'm trying to...

4492
03:25:38,550 --> 03:25:39,550
I would jump alone like...

4493
03:25:39,550 --> 03:25:39,690
Come on.

4494
03:25:39,770 --> 03:25:41,410
Peak 100, or something.

4495
03:25:41,830 --> 03:25:42,170
Like...

4496
03:25:42,170 --> 03:25:43,030
It's impressive...

4497
03:25:43,030 --> 03:25:43,710
It was like...

4498
03:25:43,710 --> 03:25:44,110
Top 10.

4499
03:25:44,350 --> 03:25:45,670
But if it's like...

4500
03:25:46,250 --> 03:25:47,830
Peak 100, or peak...

4501
03:25:48,350 --> 03:25:50,530
200, or something on their stream title...

4502
03:25:50,530 --> 03:25:52,670
It's not that impressive when you see like...

4503
03:25:52,670 --> 03:25:53,290
What...

4504
03:25:53,290 --> 03:25:54,090
At what...

4505
03:25:54,590 --> 03:25:54,990
Uh...

4506
03:25:55,670 --> 03:25:56,830
When they got it.

4507
03:25:56,930 --> 03:25:57,630
I'm just coming in with that?

4508
03:25:57,770 --> 03:25:58,170
I'm just coming in.

4509
03:25:58,230 --> 03:25:58,910
I'm not coming in.

4510
03:26:00,650 --> 03:26:01,050
Okay...

4511
03:26:01,050 --> 03:26:02,430
That's my personal...

4512
03:26:02,430 --> 03:26:03,530
Okay guys.

4513
03:26:05,010 --> 03:26:06,430
It's not as impressive.

4514
03:26:08,670 --> 03:26:12,350
It's like people who like brag about... I was 150.

4515
03:26:12,590 --> 03:26:15,090
I'm like, when in the season were you?

4516
03:26:16,310 --> 03:26:17,430
I need to know.

4517
03:26:18,190 --> 03:26:19,610
Like beginning at... Oh my god!

4518
03:26:20,970 --> 03:26:23,070
I'm still alive, he didn't hit anything.

4519
03:26:24,250 --> 03:26:25,830
Okay, I'm not alive anymore.

4520
03:26:28,250 --> 03:26:28,810
Alright.

4521
03:26:30,990 --> 03:26:32,970
I am pushing him away from me.

4522
03:26:35,970 --> 03:26:38,030
I'm gonna push him away from me.

4523
03:26:41,530 --> 03:26:43,110
Oh my god.

4524
03:26:44,710 --> 03:26:45,890
Let's go next round.

4525
03:26:46,110 --> 03:26:47,610
This is the first fucking game.

4526
03:26:48,050 --> 03:26:48,510
Holy shit.

4527
03:26:54,150 --> 03:26:54,850
That...

4528
03:26:54,850 --> 03:26:56,190
Doki Bird.

4529
03:26:56,770 --> 03:26:58,590
That was interesting.

4530
03:26:59,350 --> 03:27:01,210
Why does it suddenly say Doki Bird?

4531
03:27:01,510 --> 03:27:02,490
Out of nowhere.

4532
03:27:05,870 --> 03:27:07,910
Amplifier will save us.

4533
03:27:08,670 --> 03:27:10,930
Yeah, it sort of did it.

4534
03:27:11,290 --> 03:27:11,890
Oh my god!

4535
03:27:12,150 --> 03:27:15,030
Minus 24 just because I was in a GM game!

4536
03:27:15,030 --> 03:27:16,730
Oh my god!

4537
03:27:17,390 --> 03:27:23,290
The mount... Minus 24 just because I was in a GM game.

4538
03:27:23,650 --> 03:27:24,470
I...

4539
03:27:24,470 --> 03:27:25,970
Oh my... Wait.

4540
03:27:26,170 --> 03:27:27,930
Did you avoid...

4541
03:27:27,930 --> 03:27:29,810
Boat Fantastics?

4542
03:27:34,010 --> 03:27:35,290
Okay, nice.

4543
03:27:35,730 --> 03:27:36,410
Yes!

4544
03:27:36,590 --> 03:27:37,910
Of fucking course!

4545
03:27:38,450 --> 03:27:39,150
Alright, that's good.

4546
03:27:41,110 --> 03:27:42,970
That was a fast avoid.

4547
03:27:50,140 --> 03:27:50,760
Awkward.

4548
03:27:50,760 --> 03:27:51,920
That was awkward.

4549
03:27:52,400 --> 03:27:52,560
Actually.

4550
03:27:52,660 --> 03:27:52,860
Okay.

4551
03:27:55,240 --> 03:27:55,860
Okay.

4552
03:27:55,860 --> 03:27:56,440
I need to know.

4553
03:27:57,100 --> 03:27:57,660
Actually.

4554
03:27:58,100 --> 03:27:58,520
Alright.

4555
03:27:58,580 --> 03:27:59,180
If he actually...

4556
03:28:01,200 --> 03:28:05,340
If he actually got there, like...

4557
03:28:06,260 --> 03:28:06,880
Alright.

4558
03:28:06,900 --> 03:28:07,600
Where is it?

4559
03:28:07,900 --> 03:28:08,340
Alright.

4560
03:28:10,200 --> 03:28:11,740
He has a GM tag.

4561
03:28:12,080 --> 03:28:12,720
You see that?

4562
03:28:12,900 --> 03:28:13,240
Alright.

4563
03:28:13,420 --> 03:28:13,980
Okay.

4564
03:28:16,620 --> 03:28:17,240
Alright.

4565
03:28:17,520 --> 03:28:21,220
I know he didn't end Top 500 in any season.

4566
03:28:23,000 --> 03:28:23,600
Because...

4567
03:28:23,600 --> 03:28:24,200
Actually.

4568
03:28:24,400 --> 03:28:24,500
No.

4569
03:28:24,880 --> 03:28:25,480
Because...

4570
03:28:25,480 --> 03:28:26,580
Rixx has that one.

4571
03:28:26,800 --> 03:28:26,940
But...

4572
03:28:26,940 --> 03:28:29,260
Didn't Rixx end Top 500 last season?

4573
03:28:29,720 --> 03:28:30,500
Oh no!

4574
03:28:30,620 --> 03:28:31,120
He didn't!

4575
03:28:31,380 --> 03:28:31,940
He barely...

4576
03:28:31,940 --> 03:28:32,940
He just...

4577
03:28:32,940 --> 03:28:33,360
Okay.

4578
03:28:33,520 --> 03:28:34,980
So like...

4579
03:28:35,300 --> 03:28:37,080
If he ended recently...

4580
03:28:37,940 --> 03:28:39,960
If he ended recently...

4581
03:28:39,960 --> 03:28:41,380
He would put the...

4582
03:28:41,380 --> 03:28:42,840
Last season...

4583
03:28:42,840 --> 03:28:44,520
He would put the Top 500 season.

4584
03:28:46,040 --> 03:28:46,640
So...

4585
03:28:47,440 --> 03:28:48,040
Uh...

4586
03:28:48,040 --> 03:28:48,620
So like...

4587
03:28:48,620 --> 03:28:49,140
He didn't.

4588
03:28:49,380 --> 03:28:50,320
So I knew that...

4589
03:28:50,320 --> 03:28:50,520
Oh yeah.

4590
03:28:50,560 --> 03:28:50,880
You're right.

4591
03:28:50,940 --> 03:28:51,780
I could've...

4592
03:28:51,780 --> 03:28:52,580
He didn't.

4593
03:28:52,580 --> 03:28:54,360
So I knew that...

4594
03:28:54,360 --> 03:28:56,280
He didn't end Top 500.

4595
03:28:56,900 --> 03:28:57,460
Okay.

4596
03:28:57,520 --> 03:28:58,320
What about his?

4597
03:29:05,390 --> 03:29:05,990
His...

4598
03:29:06,570 --> 03:29:06,870
What's...

4599
03:29:06,870 --> 03:29:07,030
Oh.

4600
03:29:07,130 --> 03:29:07,710
I'm still...

4601
03:29:07,710 --> 03:29:08,690
I'm still high bro.

4602
03:29:09,710 --> 03:29:10,690
We're both...

4603
03:29:10,690 --> 03:29:11,350
Celestial.

4604
03:29:11,510 --> 03:29:12,250
Oh my god.

4605
03:29:12,730 --> 03:29:13,250
Alright.

4606
03:29:13,630 --> 03:29:14,590
Jesus Christ.

4607
03:29:18,430 --> 03:29:22,650
His entire purpose in life was to play the worst characters possible.

4608
03:29:23,810 --> 03:29:25,150
That was...

4609
03:29:25,150 --> 03:29:26,710
That was his purpose.

4610
03:29:28,390 --> 03:29:30,270
He made it to Celestial.

4611
03:29:30,550 --> 03:29:30,930
30...

4612
03:29:31,790 --> 03:29:32,190
271...

4613
03:29:32,190 --> 03:29:33,730
51 hours already.

4614
03:29:33,930 --> 03:29:34,650
Jesus fuck.

4615
03:29:35,670 --> 03:29:36,050
Bro.

4616
03:29:36,350 --> 03:29:36,950
What the fuck?

4617
03:29:36,950 --> 03:29:38,590
This guy has like...

4618
03:29:39,470 --> 03:29:40,850
30 more...

4619
03:29:42,110 --> 03:29:46,550
This guy has almost 40 more hours than me and he's still in Celestial 3.

4620
03:29:53,880 --> 03:29:54,360
Bro.

4621
03:29:54,420 --> 03:29:55,720
The fact that he has like...

4622
03:29:56,360 --> 03:29:57,220
Almost 30...

4623
03:29:57,220 --> 03:29:57,460
Yeah.

4624
03:29:57,680 --> 03:29:57,760
No.

4625
03:29:58,880 --> 03:30:02,460
He has 30 hours more than me and he's still in Celestial 3.

4626
03:30:12,940 --> 03:30:13,920
Which was fantastic.

4627
03:30:14,320 --> 03:30:15,420
I mean he was really good.

4628
03:30:16,400 --> 03:30:18,040
In the beginning of Season 2.

4629
03:30:18,040 --> 03:30:18,200
Ew.

4630
03:30:19,880 --> 03:30:20,720
Don't say that.

4631
03:30:20,840 --> 03:30:22,880
I played League for 10 years and I'm still...

4632
03:30:22,880 --> 03:30:24,880
I'm still a gold Sag.

4633
03:30:25,140 --> 03:30:25,500
It's okay.

4634
03:30:25,660 --> 03:30:26,040
It's different.

4635
03:30:26,960 --> 03:30:28,080
That's different guys.

4636
03:30:29,220 --> 03:30:29,760
Wait.

4637
03:30:30,040 --> 03:30:31,440
Someone is...

4638
03:30:33,080 --> 03:30:35,320
Someone on the enemy team is top 500.

4639
03:30:36,060 --> 03:30:36,520
I don't know who.

4640
03:30:36,900 --> 03:30:37,540
Twitch TV.

4641
03:30:41,420 --> 03:30:42,220
Twitch TV.

4642
03:30:42,340 --> 03:30:43,820
Oh, we have 3 supports.

4643
03:30:43,820 --> 03:30:43,860
We have 3 supports.

4644
03:30:44,740 --> 03:30:45,500
Glad you remembered.

4645
03:30:46,800 --> 03:30:47,060
Oh yeah.

4646
03:30:47,180 --> 03:30:48,000
I'm gonna fucking know her.

4647
03:30:49,820 --> 03:30:52,340
It's worse because you played League.

4648
03:30:52,580 --> 03:30:53,360
Are you followed?

4649
03:30:53,500 --> 03:30:54,200
Are you subbed?

4650
03:30:54,260 --> 03:30:55,780
Are you gonna be there tomorrow on the live?

4651
03:30:56,420 --> 03:30:56,820
No.

4652
03:30:58,540 --> 03:30:59,120
I'm fucking...

4653
03:30:59,120 --> 03:31:00,080
I'm playing a tournament tomorrow.

4654
03:31:01,260 --> 03:31:01,600
Okay.

4655
03:31:02,100 --> 03:31:02,900
That's a good excuse.

4656
03:31:03,040 --> 03:31:03,460
That's true.

4657
03:31:04,140 --> 03:31:07,000
The fact that you're able to still play it for 10 years...

4658
03:31:07,000 --> 03:31:08,060
After that?

4659
03:31:09,000 --> 03:31:11,160
Garrett, if we win this game, how about that?

4660
03:31:13,140 --> 03:31:14,720
Well, if we lose, it's not gonna be on me.

4661
03:31:15,400 --> 03:31:15,920
Think so?

4662
03:31:17,160 --> 03:31:18,020
Good, alright.

4663
03:31:24,910 --> 03:31:27,330
That's good, he can't commit more hate crime.

4664
03:31:29,090 --> 03:31:32,670
Alright, what are we... I'm not being proud of this vote.

4665
03:31:41,660 --> 03:31:42,100
Aww...

4666
03:31:42,740 --> 03:31:45,080
I've got terrible doggy players on the team.

4667
03:31:45,080 --> 03:31:46,560
I'm not judging.

4668
03:31:48,940 --> 03:31:50,340
Mantis, do you play, uh...

4669
03:31:52,100 --> 03:31:53,760
Do you play like Sue or Luna or something?

4670
03:31:54,020 --> 03:31:56,380
I'm not the type who fades quietly into the battle.

4671
03:31:56,600 --> 03:31:57,840
We should triple tank, honestly.

4672
03:31:59,140 --> 03:32:00,160
No, we just play wolf.

4673
03:32:01,060 --> 03:32:01,860
Yeah, I play wolf, yeah.

4674
03:32:05,120 --> 03:32:05,560
Fifteen!

4675
03:32:07,240 --> 03:32:09,440
You think I've only played 13 hours?

4676
03:32:10,400 --> 03:32:11,360
Joke's on you.

4677
03:32:11,460 --> 03:32:12,300
Shit doesn't work out.

4678
03:32:12,700 --> 03:32:13,340
Let's go up right quick.

4679
03:32:13,980 --> 03:32:15,360
I would just start on mag, bro.

4680
03:32:16,420 --> 03:32:19,040
They're gonna have wolf, probably, if Groot's in the game.

4681
03:32:19,260 --> 03:32:20,020
That was just so bad.

4682
03:32:20,580 --> 03:32:21,060
Aw, I'm very fine.

4683
03:32:22,080 --> 03:32:22,580
That was not bad.

4684
03:32:23,680 --> 03:32:24,360
Yeah, he's pretty bad.

4685
03:32:25,940 --> 03:32:27,180
Yeah, pretty good.

4686
03:32:29,940 --> 03:32:31,560
I wish he was good, because...

4687
03:32:32,200 --> 03:32:34,960
If he was good, then the game would have some diverse impumps.

4688
03:32:34,960 --> 03:32:35,800
What the fuck?

4689
03:32:36,060 --> 03:32:36,620
Same match.

4690
03:32:36,780 --> 03:32:38,420
Same match.

4691
03:32:38,440 --> 03:32:40,620
Do remember to call me Logan.

4692
03:32:41,160 --> 03:32:43,500
Why would I do that, bub?

4693
03:32:44,020 --> 03:32:47,260
I am one of the few who can throw the both of you.

4694
03:32:48,320 --> 03:32:48,880
What?

4695
03:32:49,140 --> 03:32:49,540
What tournament is tomorrow?

4696
03:32:50,640 --> 03:32:52,960
Uh, it's called the North America...

4697
03:32:52,960 --> 03:32:54,620
Like, it's literally...

4698
03:32:54,620 --> 03:32:55,100
It's so cringe.

4699
03:32:55,260 --> 03:32:57,180
It's called the High Elo Player Tournament or something.

4700
03:32:57,340 --> 03:32:57,640
I'm...

4701
03:32:57,640 --> 03:32:58,840
I'm playing with Mace.

4702
03:32:59,840 --> 03:33:00,480
I don't know.

4703
03:33:01,000 --> 03:33:02,120
Some weird ass shit.

4704
03:33:02,400 --> 03:33:03,260
I'll be honest.

4705
03:33:04,260 --> 03:33:05,840
Mace is a fucking terrorist, bro.

4706
03:33:05,880 --> 03:33:07,220
That guy's baby rage is so hard.

4707
03:33:08,940 --> 03:33:09,960
He's funny as fuck though.

4708
03:33:11,220 --> 03:33:12,060
I believe it.

4709
03:33:13,740 --> 03:33:14,640
Most of his rage.

4710
03:33:14,640 --> 03:33:16,140
I honestly think he...

4711
03:33:16,140 --> 03:33:17,320
He's just a rage baiter.

4712
03:33:24,740 --> 03:33:25,480
Don't worry.

4713
03:33:26,380 --> 03:33:27,020
I got you.

4714
03:33:27,980 --> 03:33:29,140
Oh my god.

4715
03:33:29,340 --> 03:33:30,580
Maybe I don't got you.

4716
03:33:30,580 --> 03:33:31,860
You just can't put it.

4717
03:33:32,080 --> 03:33:32,440
I was worried.

4718
03:33:32,680 --> 03:33:33,680
I was out behind you.

4719
03:33:33,700 --> 03:33:34,200
No total.

4720
03:33:38,000 --> 03:33:39,300
Alright, well...

4721
03:33:39,300 --> 03:33:41,760
My shield is gone so good luck Luna.

4722
03:33:42,660 --> 03:33:44,160
Can't heal right now.

4723
03:33:46,660 --> 03:33:47,640
Luna please.

4724
03:33:48,440 --> 03:33:50,540
I'm going my best to heal you.

4725
03:33:53,280 --> 03:33:55,060
Oh my god.

4726
03:33:56,360 --> 03:33:59,040
Come on bro, this app Geoff shit is so annoying.

4727
03:34:03,400 --> 03:34:05,620
I'll do UL first.

4728
03:34:09,580 --> 03:34:10,500
That's awkward!

4729
03:34:11,540 --> 03:34:14,200
Oh my god, it's my favorite, guys!

4730
03:34:14,440 --> 03:34:14,920
Oh, nice!

4731
03:34:15,360 --> 03:34:16,280
It is my favorite.

4732
03:34:16,400 --> 03:34:18,500
Wait, wait, this is my favorite.

4733
03:34:18,620 --> 03:34:19,160
Wait a minute.

4734
03:34:22,860 --> 03:34:26,920
Wait, this is my favorite, guys!

4735
03:34:27,200 --> 03:34:28,600
We got...

4736
03:34:29,640 --> 03:34:30,240
Yay!

4737
03:34:41,670 --> 03:34:42,270
Nice.

4738
03:34:43,010 --> 03:34:46,890
Jesus, they've been fucking stalling this for 20 years!

4739
03:34:52,450 --> 03:34:53,810
I have to use this.

4740
03:34:54,090 --> 03:34:55,510
I was too scared.

4741
03:34:56,750 --> 03:34:58,450
I was actually so scared.

4742
03:34:58,970 --> 03:34:59,730
Oh, wow.

4743
03:35:03,670 --> 03:35:04,730
Oh my god.

4744
03:35:05,330 --> 03:35:07,250
How is this still going?

4745
03:35:07,790 --> 03:35:09,910
How is this still going?

4746
03:35:10,070 --> 03:35:10,770
Captain, captain.

4747
03:35:11,190 --> 03:35:11,390
I don't know.

4748
03:35:15,100 --> 03:35:15,400
Okay.

4749
03:35:16,180 --> 03:35:16,660
Okay.

4750
03:35:16,720 --> 03:35:17,100
Fuck off.

4751
03:35:23,290 --> 03:35:24,010
It's fine.

4752
03:35:24,430 --> 03:35:25,710
I'm gonna play high ground so I can get out.

4753
03:35:29,010 --> 03:35:30,630
Oh my god, wait, she did it!

4754
03:35:31,730 --> 03:35:33,450
Oh, she did not do it!

4755
03:35:33,450 --> 03:35:33,850
That's one though.

4756
03:35:36,290 --> 03:35:37,030
This is bad.

4757
03:35:37,210 --> 03:35:40,250
This is a little bad.

4758
03:35:41,250 --> 03:35:43,250
I have to keep this because I got scared.

4759
03:35:44,630 --> 03:35:45,510
I'll bubble for you, Wolverine.

4760
03:35:46,910 --> 03:35:47,370
Scare your suit.

4761
03:35:50,430 --> 03:35:51,870
I just got so long, Pip.

4762
03:35:52,510 --> 03:35:52,610
Okay.

4763
03:35:54,130 --> 03:35:54,370
That's good.

4764
03:35:56,170 --> 03:35:56,710
Oh my god.

4765
03:36:01,910 --> 03:36:04,790
I have to focus so much because there's dive!

4766
03:36:09,100 --> 03:36:10,300
Please, please.

4767
03:36:11,660 --> 03:36:12,300
No!

4768
03:36:15,970 --> 03:36:16,610
No!

4769
03:36:26,950 --> 03:36:29,070
I can't jump high enough.

4770
03:36:30,770 --> 03:36:32,710
It's clear, I'm still needed here.

4771
03:36:32,710 --> 03:36:36,310
I tried to jump, but he jumped off!

4772
03:36:38,610 --> 03:36:40,450
He jumped off!

4773
03:36:41,990 --> 03:36:43,590
Oh, that's unlucky.

4774
03:36:44,390 --> 03:36:46,010
I can get a Michael.

4775
03:36:47,210 --> 03:36:47,970
At least a while.

4776
03:36:53,530 --> 03:36:54,550
Come on, Michael, come on, Michael.

4777
03:36:55,170 --> 03:36:57,190
He's trying to go hard.

4778
03:36:59,070 --> 03:37:00,310
Jesus Christ.

4779
03:37:02,810 --> 03:37:04,430
Which one's mine?

4780
03:37:04,430 --> 03:37:04,690
She's mine!

4781
03:37:09,830 --> 03:37:11,450
Oh my god, that was so scary.

4782
03:37:11,790 --> 03:37:12,430
That was so scary.

4783
03:37:12,470 --> 03:37:13,550
That was so scary.

4784
03:37:13,670 --> 03:37:14,790
I was 1 HP.

4785
03:37:17,830 --> 03:37:19,070
It's okay, I will pass now.

4786
03:37:19,430 --> 03:37:22,950
That was so scary.

4787
03:37:24,610 --> 03:37:25,330
Help my Luna!

4788
03:37:25,450 --> 03:37:25,850
Help my Luna!

4789
03:37:27,030 --> 03:37:27,830
Oh but...

4790
03:37:32,570 --> 03:37:33,910
I don't feel so fine.

4791
03:37:34,210 --> 03:37:35,750
I don't feel so fine no more.

4792
03:37:45,330 --> 03:37:46,270
It's not fine anymore.

4793
03:37:46,370 --> 03:37:46,910
I don't feel fine.

4794
03:37:47,010 --> 03:37:48,190
I don't feel fine anymore.

4795
03:37:52,750 --> 03:37:54,170
I killed like all of them.

4796
03:37:54,450 --> 03:37:54,850
Oh my god.

4797
03:38:05,230 --> 03:38:05,750
No!

4798
03:38:05,750 --> 03:38:07,930
In fact, it was not fine.

4799
03:38:08,710 --> 03:38:12,230
Guys, it was not fine.

4800
03:38:15,670 --> 03:38:18,370
It did not feel fine in the end.

4801
03:38:22,210 --> 03:38:23,250
You ready?

4802
03:38:23,470 --> 03:38:26,210
Do you want to just go hella, just sit in the back and just two-tap Jeff?

4803
03:38:29,110 --> 03:38:32,290
It was not very fantastic, guys.

4804
03:38:33,350 --> 03:38:36,410
I did not feel very fantastic today.

4805
03:38:40,610 --> 03:38:42,450
Hey, thank you for the hundred biddies!

4806
03:38:42,630 --> 03:38:43,530
Thank you, thank you!

4807
03:38:48,030 --> 03:38:50,330
I have a theme that fuck-ass theme song, huh?

4808
03:38:50,530 --> 03:38:51,350
It is or something.

4809
03:38:51,850 --> 03:38:52,290
It's a point out.

4810
03:38:53,350 --> 03:38:53,790
Alright.

4811
03:38:55,370 --> 03:38:57,650
It's time to go through hell yet again.

4812
03:38:57,870 --> 03:39:01,350
All you need to do is capture the mission area.

4813
03:39:01,850 --> 03:39:02,150
Got it?

4814
03:39:02,310 --> 03:39:02,650
Snap!

4815
03:39:03,910 --> 03:39:04,350
Yay!

4816
03:39:08,710 --> 03:39:11,690
I am the queen of degen gaming hours.

4817
03:39:14,070 --> 03:39:17,670
It's not Marvel Rivals without being degenerates.

4818
03:39:26,950 --> 03:39:29,310
Alright, let me use this.

4819
03:39:29,650 --> 03:39:30,510
No lamp!

4820
03:39:32,610 --> 03:39:33,410
Oh!

4821
03:39:35,490 --> 03:39:36,290
Oh!

4822
03:39:36,650 --> 03:39:37,890
No lamps, I guess.

4823
03:39:38,090 --> 03:39:39,910
I am the queen of degeny.

4824
03:39:40,010 --> 03:39:41,350
I am the queen!

4825
03:39:41,350 --> 03:39:42,890
Oh, okay.

4826
03:39:45,770 --> 03:39:47,210
Yeah, I'm just killing them very much.

4827
03:39:48,710 --> 03:39:50,030
Hey, make me as well tell them.

4828
03:39:50,950 --> 03:39:52,690
Yeah, this is a little awkward.

4829
03:39:53,950 --> 03:39:55,210
Oh, usually I don't.

4830
03:39:55,570 --> 03:39:56,230
I've just been.

4831
03:39:56,470 --> 03:39:57,290
I'm just gonna block my shots.

4832
03:39:59,350 --> 03:40:00,790
We're still fucking gaming.

4833
03:40:00,790 --> 03:40:02,650
I outnumber you.

4834
03:40:03,470 --> 03:40:03,950
Behold!

4835
03:40:04,190 --> 03:40:05,630
Your powers are mine!

4836
03:40:05,730 --> 03:40:06,550
Oh, at least.

4837
03:40:07,090 --> 03:40:07,870
Oh, nice.

4838
03:40:08,070 --> 03:40:08,590
It's still winable.

4839
03:40:09,290 --> 03:40:10,790
I killed Jeff.

4840
03:40:10,990 --> 03:40:12,250
You guys can win the fuck out of that.

4841
03:40:12,650 --> 03:40:13,410
There they are.

4842
03:40:13,970 --> 03:40:15,610
I am ready to put on a show.

4843
03:40:15,710 --> 03:40:16,470
Hold on, Lola.

4844
03:40:16,790 --> 03:40:17,210
Hold on.

4845
03:40:17,490 --> 03:40:17,870
What the fuck?

4846
03:40:19,190 --> 03:40:20,470
He ran in.

4847
03:40:20,570 --> 03:40:20,870
Okay.

4848
03:40:21,370 --> 03:40:22,050
Hey, okay.

4849
03:40:22,890 --> 03:40:23,370
Alright.

4850
03:40:25,010 --> 03:40:25,490
Goodbye.

4851
03:40:25,910 --> 03:40:28,550
I am

4852
03:40:31,840 --> 03:40:33,000
ready to put on a show.

4853
03:40:35,300 --> 03:40:36,100
That's fine.

4854
03:40:36,380 --> 03:40:37,220
That's fine.

4855
03:40:37,340 --> 03:40:37,400
That's fine.

4856
03:40:37,400 --> 03:40:38,320
We're fine, Thor.

4857
03:40:38,940 --> 03:40:39,580
You and me.

4858
03:40:43,760 --> 03:40:44,360
Okay.

4859
03:40:44,660 --> 03:40:46,020
He's ready to assemble, guys.

4860
03:40:48,680 --> 03:40:49,280
What?

4861
03:40:54,600 --> 03:40:55,200
What?

4862
03:40:56,940 --> 03:40:58,140
Why me?

4863
03:40:59,480 --> 03:41:00,080
What?

4864
03:41:00,080 --> 03:41:00,280
What?

4865
03:41:01,560 --> 03:41:02,000
What?

4866
03:41:02,960 --> 03:41:03,020
What?

4867
03:41:03,040 --> 03:41:03,480
What?

4868
03:41:04,600 --> 03:41:05,940
What the fuck?

4869
03:41:10,280 --> 03:41:11,440
That's fucked up.

4870
03:41:13,600 --> 03:41:14,040
That's...

4871
03:41:14,040 --> 03:41:16,560
Oh, and then the map moves, too.

4872
03:41:17,660 --> 03:41:19,460
What if we just have, like, clear match up or something?

4873
03:41:19,620 --> 03:41:20,180
You're on the back.

4874
03:41:20,960 --> 03:41:21,820
Oh, my god!

4875
03:41:22,220 --> 03:41:23,300
I don't have...

4876
03:41:23,300 --> 03:41:24,080
I don't...

4877
03:41:24,080 --> 03:41:24,780
I don't...

4878
03:41:24,780 --> 03:41:25,780
Ah!

4879
03:41:26,220 --> 03:41:27,160
Oh, my god!

4880
03:41:27,320 --> 03:41:27,780
There's a...

4881
03:41:27,780 --> 03:41:28,560
There's a god!

4882
03:41:29,640 --> 03:41:31,320
I believe now!

4883
03:41:31,800 --> 03:41:32,320
Later, later.

4884
03:41:34,700 --> 03:41:35,500
Okay.

4885
03:41:42,530 --> 03:41:43,330
Okay.

4886
03:41:43,810 --> 03:41:45,430
I believe now.

4887
03:41:46,050 --> 03:41:47,850
I believe...

4888
03:41:48,730 --> 03:41:52,930
I got solo ulted, like, two times in one round.

4889
03:41:52,930 --> 03:41:53,370
Round.

4890
03:41:53,670 --> 03:41:56,310
It was hard to believe in anything anymore.

4891
03:42:00,790 --> 03:42:01,930
Your powers are mine!

4892
03:42:01,950 --> 03:42:03,050
The reflex app...

4893
03:42:03,050 --> 03:42:03,810
That's pretty good.

4894
03:42:04,130 --> 03:42:05,290
Your powers are mine!

4895
03:42:09,530 --> 03:42:09,810
Okay.

4896
03:42:10,110 --> 03:42:10,730
Nine...

4897
03:42:10,730 --> 03:42:11,310
Eight...

4898
03:42:11,700 --> 03:42:12,050
Seven...

4899
03:42:12,050 --> 03:42:12,450
Six...

4900
03:42:12,450 --> 03:42:13,290
Five...

4901
03:42:13,290 --> 03:42:13,750
Four...

4902
03:42:13,750 --> 03:42:13,910
Eight...

4903
03:42:15,210 --> 03:42:15,770
Let's go.

4904
03:42:16,030 --> 03:42:16,790
Oh my god!

4905
03:42:17,090 --> 03:42:17,650
Twinsies!

4906
03:42:19,930 --> 03:42:20,830
Let's go.

4907
03:42:21,510 --> 03:42:23,730
I'll most likely be the one that dies!

4908
03:42:30,040 --> 03:42:33,600
Alright, I didn't mean to press shift there, but that's okay.

4909
03:42:40,120 --> 03:42:40,680
Alright.

4910
03:42:47,630 --> 03:42:48,350
Alright.

4911
03:42:49,850 --> 03:42:51,110
That's awkward.

4912
03:42:52,470 --> 03:42:54,430
It's just you and I.

4913
03:42:55,470 --> 03:42:56,350
That's okay.

4914
03:42:59,030 --> 03:43:01,810
That is definitely very awkward for us.

4915
03:43:04,490 --> 03:43:07,430
Hey guys, I don't know how I'm alive.

4916
03:43:16,690 --> 03:43:18,910
Oh, what the fuck?

4917
03:43:29,890 --> 03:43:31,670
I couldn't count!

4918
03:43:32,110 --> 03:43:32,930
It's fine.

4919
03:43:33,310 --> 03:43:33,770
That's fine.

4920
03:43:33,930 --> 03:43:35,610
I lost track.

4921
03:43:39,210 --> 03:43:41,870
I would admit I lost track to counts.

4922
03:43:44,130 --> 03:43:46,710
I don't think anybody plays cap, guys.

4923
03:43:51,180 --> 03:43:51,840
Okay.

4924
03:43:53,140 --> 03:43:53,800
Reload.

4925
03:43:53,920 --> 03:43:55,220
I have to reload.

4926
03:43:55,640 --> 03:43:56,920
Oh my god, please.

4927
03:43:57,800 --> 03:43:58,200
Please.

4928
03:44:00,020 --> 03:44:01,080
Really good tech.

4929
03:44:04,440 --> 03:44:05,420
Oh my god.

4930
03:44:06,020 --> 03:44:07,880
I got... I got scared.

4931
03:44:09,980 --> 03:44:11,200
I got scared.

4932
03:44:11,740 --> 03:44:13,300
I got so scared.

4933
03:44:13,300 --> 03:44:13,380
You ready?

4934
03:44:13,400 --> 03:44:13,860
You ready?

4935
03:44:13,880 --> 03:44:15,060
I don't think that...

4936
03:44:15,060 --> 03:44:16,380
I'm gonna discard him instantly.

4937
03:44:16,500 --> 03:44:16,580
You ready?

4938
03:44:24,730 --> 03:44:25,510
He caught the mech.

4939
03:44:25,550 --> 03:44:26,010
He caught the mech.

4940
03:44:26,010 --> 03:44:26,110
He caught the mech.

4941
03:44:26,210 --> 03:44:28,950
No, he caught... What the fuck?

4942
03:44:35,120 --> 03:44:39,100
I shifted and he fucking ulted me!

4943
03:44:39,440 --> 03:44:40,240
That's crazy.

4944
03:44:42,860 --> 03:44:45,400
He actually shifted me!

4945
03:44:47,020 --> 03:44:49,180
Oh my god.

4946
03:44:49,960 --> 03:44:53,580
I shifted and he dragged me all the way out.

4947
03:44:57,500 --> 03:44:59,060
That was crazy.

4948
03:45:00,200 --> 03:45:02,540
I got solo ulted three times.

4949
03:45:03,580 --> 03:45:07,200
He like ulted me and it dragged my entire lamp.

4950
03:45:08,640 --> 03:45:12,200
He dragged my entire lamp into the ult.

4951
03:45:16,360 --> 03:45:17,600
That was actually insane.

4952
03:45:17,740 --> 03:45:18,420
Cause I tried...

4953
03:45:18,420 --> 03:45:18,580
Ooh.

4954
03:45:19,480 --> 03:45:21,620
Okay, but if I lose, I can climb back to Celestial too.

4955
03:45:21,740 --> 03:45:23,080
And that's the brush of it.

4956
03:45:24,960 --> 03:45:26,180
I've always been a...

4957
03:45:26,180 --> 03:45:28,900
I've always been a fucking tree hater.

4958
03:45:29,120 --> 03:45:30,200
I've always hated Groot.

4959
03:45:34,860 --> 03:45:35,340
Bro!

4960
03:45:35,580 --> 03:45:36,320
That was crazy!

4961
03:45:36,720 --> 03:45:37,360
I tried...

4962
03:45:37,360 --> 03:45:37,560
I...

4963
03:45:37,560 --> 03:45:40,280
I tried to give invuln to my cloak.

4964
03:45:46,680 --> 03:45:49,840
I tried to give invuln to my cloak and he literally...

4965
03:45:51,500 --> 03:45:54,020
He literally like ulted me out of it.

4966
03:45:57,990 --> 03:45:59,050
Fuck, he sucked.

4967
03:45:59,810 --> 03:46:01,570
There's nothing else I could do about it.

4968
03:46:08,410 --> 03:46:08,950
No!

4969
03:46:09,250 --> 03:46:10,250
No, I like Luna Snow.

4970
03:46:10,250 --> 03:46:11,290
She's my exception.

4971
03:46:12,350 --> 03:46:13,350
It's not true.

4972
03:46:16,070 --> 03:46:17,050
Oh, hey, there's Mace.

4973
03:46:17,310 --> 03:46:17,790
Oh, he's...

4974
03:46:17,790 --> 03:46:19,510
I know he's dealing with somebody, but I don't know who.

4975
03:46:19,710 --> 03:46:20,910
Who do you think you want to be today?

4976
03:46:28,630 --> 03:46:29,630
Hence, I want to try rank.

4977
03:46:29,730 --> 03:46:30,590
I want to avoid it.

4978
03:46:31,310 --> 03:46:31,710
Uh...

4979
03:46:31,710 --> 03:46:32,490
Rank is fun.

4980
03:46:33,230 --> 03:46:34,030
Just like...

4981
03:46:34,030 --> 03:46:34,710
It's just...

4982
03:46:35,650 --> 03:46:37,270
It just gets you super addicted.

4983
03:46:43,890 --> 03:46:45,070
The Groot Trauma.

4984
03:46:46,590 --> 03:46:47,690
Everyone's just like...

4985
03:46:47,690 --> 03:46:48,530
Get him out!

4986
03:46:49,770 --> 03:46:50,170
Everyone...

4987
03:46:50,170 --> 03:46:51,370
Everyone's like...

4988
03:46:52,670 --> 03:46:54,390
No more Groot!

4989
03:46:55,470 --> 03:46:56,990
I have had enough.

4990
03:47:00,150 --> 03:47:01,150
It's kind of fun.

4991
03:47:01,450 --> 03:47:03,710
I've been streaming Ravos for 15 hours now.

4992
03:47:04,910 --> 03:47:05,290
I don't know.

4993
03:47:05,290 --> 03:47:06,010
Ben Torch, Bantorch.

4994
03:47:06,170 --> 03:47:06,970
They're not gonna ban Torch.

4995
03:47:08,410 --> 03:47:09,050
Think so.

4996
03:47:09,230 --> 03:47:10,030
But they're gonna pick...

4997
03:47:10,030 --> 03:47:10,670
Cap Jeff Wilson.

4998
03:47:11,030 --> 03:47:11,470
That's a ship.

4999
03:47:12,370 --> 03:47:14,490
They have less, but they're not gonna ban Torch.

5000
03:47:18,730 --> 03:47:19,810
I think it's fun when you win.

5001
03:47:19,990 --> 03:47:20,370
Exactly!

5002
03:47:33,260 --> 03:47:33,760
That'll do.

5003
03:47:34,660 --> 03:47:36,900
The right heroes could make all the difference.

5004
03:47:37,340 --> 03:47:39,740
I mean, they do have a Torch player, so...

5005
03:47:39,740 --> 03:47:41,040
I'd rather fight Cap than Torch.

5006
03:47:46,030 --> 03:47:47,750
He's gonna be on a side lock though, so...

5007
03:47:47,750 --> 03:47:48,310
Watch out for that.

5008
03:47:51,750 --> 03:47:52,270
Alright.

5009
03:47:52,670 --> 03:47:53,830
Luna Rocket.

5010
03:47:54,650 --> 03:47:55,170
Uh...

5011
03:47:55,170 --> 03:47:56,130
I'll just put...

5012
03:47:56,130 --> 03:47:57,350
My orb on.

5013
03:47:57,770 --> 03:47:58,590
Awesome, Mr. Frisco!

5014
03:47:58,710 --> 03:47:59,930
Thank you for the tier 1 sub!

5015
03:48:00,170 --> 03:48:00,390
Thank you!

5016
03:48:00,510 --> 03:48:01,050
Thank you!

5017
03:48:01,310 --> 03:48:02,390
I really appreciate it!

5018
03:48:07,100 --> 03:48:07,700
Um...

5019
03:48:07,700 --> 03:48:07,860
Yeah.

5020
03:48:08,120 --> 03:48:09,340
He's like the best tank.

5021
03:48:10,640 --> 03:48:11,740
In higher elo.

5022
03:48:11,980 --> 03:48:12,980
It's just really annoying.

5023
03:48:13,920 --> 03:48:14,860
In general.

5024
03:48:15,780 --> 03:48:17,900
He's just very annoying to play against.

5025
03:48:23,320 --> 03:48:23,920
Alright.

5026
03:48:24,320 --> 03:48:26,580
Time to get fucked by Captain America.

5027
03:48:27,080 --> 03:48:27,860
I died.

5028
03:48:29,400 --> 03:48:30,000
Woo!

5029
03:48:30,580 --> 03:48:31,860
I love higher elo.

5030
03:48:33,000 --> 03:48:34,380
I'm never coming anywhere to eat.

5031
03:48:34,380 --> 03:48:34,580
Donkey?

5032
03:48:36,920 --> 03:48:37,260
Alright.

5033
03:48:37,580 --> 03:48:38,280
For America.

5034
03:48:44,300 --> 03:48:45,040
Don't worry.

5035
03:48:45,380 --> 03:48:47,440
It'll happen to all of you too, one day.

5036
03:48:47,980 --> 03:48:48,060
One, three, two, one!

5037
03:48:49,640 --> 03:48:50,640
The enemy has arrived.

5038
03:48:50,660 --> 03:48:51,540
Yep, they have got...

5039
03:48:51,540 --> 03:48:51,980
and clock.

5040
03:48:52,280 --> 03:48:53,240
Oh, hey, hey, hey.

5041
03:48:53,320 --> 03:48:54,140
You remember what I said?

5042
03:48:54,380 --> 03:48:55,620
Hey, look at this over there!

5043
03:48:55,760 --> 03:48:55,980
Whoa!

5044
03:48:58,520 --> 03:49:00,580
Guys, remember what I just said?

5045
03:49:00,900 --> 03:49:01,200
Whoa!

5046
03:49:01,200 --> 03:49:01,420
No!

5047
03:49:02,400 --> 03:49:04,620
It's like I played this game.

5048
03:49:05,180 --> 03:49:06,280
It's too...

5049
03:49:06,280 --> 03:49:08,240
It's like I played this game at high elo then.

5050
03:49:08,640 --> 03:49:08,660
No.

5051
03:49:09,220 --> 03:49:09,740
No!

5052
03:49:09,880 --> 03:49:10,780
There it is!

5053
03:49:11,360 --> 03:49:12,520
There he is!

5054
03:49:16,270 --> 03:49:18,470
Up, he's coming over!

5055
03:49:22,830 --> 03:49:23,510
Bitch.

5056
03:49:23,970 --> 03:49:24,250
Bitch.

5057
03:49:25,710 --> 03:49:26,390
Okay.

5058
03:49:26,950 --> 03:49:27,430
Alright, spy.

5059
03:49:28,490 --> 03:49:28,970
Spy.

5060
03:49:31,590 --> 03:49:32,890
I told you.

5061
03:49:32,890 --> 03:49:32,910
Told you.

5062
03:49:33,630 --> 03:49:34,750
Oh my god, please.

5063
03:49:34,970 --> 03:49:35,290
No!

5064
03:49:42,110 --> 03:49:43,690
Oh my god, there was nothing I could do.

5065
03:49:44,050 --> 03:49:46,330
There was no outplayability there.

5066
03:49:46,770 --> 03:49:48,490
There was literally...

5067
03:49:48,490 --> 03:49:50,990
There was literally no outplayability to that.

5068
03:49:51,110 --> 03:49:51,810
I was just...

5069
03:49:51,810 --> 03:49:52,430
I was god.

5070
03:49:54,770 --> 03:49:56,370
It truly was...

5071
03:49:56,990 --> 03:49:58,770
It truly was like...

5072
03:49:58,770 --> 03:50:00,890
a TT moment of my life.

5073
03:50:03,150 --> 03:50:04,110
Oh, it's blessed.

5074
03:50:05,390 --> 03:50:06,210
There we go.

5075
03:50:06,650 --> 03:50:07,230
There we go.

5076
03:50:07,770 --> 03:50:08,190
There we go.

5077
03:50:08,190 --> 03:50:09,170
That's just like a Psylocke one...

5078
03:50:09,170 --> 03:50:10,670
A really good Psylocke one-trick.

5079
03:50:10,870 --> 03:50:11,370
So I...

5080
03:50:11,370 --> 03:50:12,070
Yeah.

5081
03:50:12,530 --> 03:50:13,370
Ha ha ha ha ha!

5082
03:50:15,890 --> 03:50:16,450
Mmm...

5083
03:50:16,450 --> 03:50:16,910
If that...

5084
03:50:16,910 --> 03:50:18,410
I might just go...

5085
03:50:18,990 --> 03:50:19,890
Invis then.

5086
03:50:20,870 --> 03:50:21,750
Actually, no.

5087
03:50:22,090 --> 03:50:23,150
If I go...

5088
03:50:23,150 --> 03:50:24,090
That's why their...

5089
03:50:24,090 --> 03:50:26,330
Their Psylocke is not trying to...

5090
03:50:26,330 --> 03:50:29,110
Their Psylocke is not 1v1-ing our Psylocke because...

5091
03:50:34,470 --> 03:50:35,490
I hear her.

5092
03:50:35,730 --> 03:50:37,030
She said Sayonara.

5093
03:50:41,010 --> 03:50:42,890
But that's why, because...

5094
03:50:50,220 --> 03:50:51,000
Oh, nice!

5095
03:50:53,460 --> 03:50:56,340
Uh, because our Psylocke has the orb.

5096
03:50:57,080 --> 03:50:57,400
So like...

5097
03:50:58,000 --> 03:50:59,380
Which is a good advantage for us.

5098
03:51:00,520 --> 03:51:01,760
So like, he doesn't know what to do.

5099
03:51:03,240 --> 03:51:05,700
I heard Sayonara and I got scared.

5100
03:51:05,900 --> 03:51:06,520
Who put Siren first?

5101
03:51:08,680 --> 03:51:09,440
Let's get that.

5102
03:51:09,440 --> 03:51:10,560
Let's get that.

5103
03:51:11,480 --> 03:51:12,660
Psylocke may be going for old.

5104
03:51:12,680 --> 03:51:16,140
Psylocke may be going for old.

5105
03:51:16,800 --> 03:51:17,820
Stuck, stuck, stuck, stuck.

5106
03:51:18,680 --> 03:51:19,320
Save me.

5107
03:51:19,420 --> 03:51:19,860
Save me.

5108
03:51:20,160 --> 03:51:20,480
Save me.

5109
03:51:22,100 --> 03:51:23,000
Oh my god!

5110
03:51:23,120 --> 03:51:23,720
I have to!

5111
03:51:25,520 --> 03:51:25,960
What?

5112
03:51:27,420 --> 03:51:28,340
That was that though.

5113
03:51:29,500 --> 03:51:29,860
Alright.

5114
03:51:31,060 --> 03:51:31,500
3...

5115
03:51:32,700 --> 03:51:33,140
2...

5116
03:51:33,900 --> 03:51:34,340
1...

5117
03:51:41,140 --> 03:51:41,620
1...

5118
03:51:44,920 --> 03:51:45,400
1...

5119
03:51:45,400 --> 03:51:45,460
1...

5120
03:51:45,460 --> 03:51:45,980
2...

5121
03:51:45,980 --> 03:51:46,060
2...

5122
03:51:46,060 --> 03:51:46,120
2...

5123
03:51:46,120 --> 03:51:46,280
3...

5124
03:51:50,780 --> 03:51:51,260
3...

5125
03:51:51,260 --> 03:51:53,780
I should...

5126
03:51:54,560 --> 03:51:56,340
I don't know if I should have ulted that.

5127
03:51:56,560 --> 03:51:58,580
I thought we stacked together and we fine.

5128
03:51:59,300 --> 03:52:01,140
I didn't think our rocket would die.

5129
03:52:02,900 --> 03:52:04,700
That's just unfortunate for our rocket.

5130
03:52:05,640 --> 03:52:05,960
Yeah.

5131
03:52:06,260 --> 03:52:07,020
It was unfortunate.

5132
03:52:07,940 --> 03:52:10,220
I saved it because...

5133
03:52:11,140 --> 03:52:13,620
I saved it just because like, our rocket...

5134
03:52:13,620 --> 03:52:15,880
I didn't think we would die if we all stacked together.

5135
03:52:17,880 --> 03:52:20,140
I need to say Luna because...

5136
03:52:20,740 --> 03:52:22,320
Bless is gonna have a...

5137
03:52:22,940 --> 03:52:23,780
Pocket now.

5138
03:52:23,780 --> 03:52:24,780
With the...

5139
03:52:28,570 --> 03:52:29,410
Bless is gonna...

5140
03:52:29,410 --> 03:52:30,670
There's that...

5141
03:52:30,670 --> 03:52:31,370
Jesus Christ.

5142
03:52:34,510 --> 03:52:36,350
We're gonna have a...

5143
03:52:36,350 --> 03:52:38,350
Orb now, Snowflake, so he can use it.

5144
03:52:44,830 --> 03:52:45,510
No!

5145
03:52:47,350 --> 03:52:48,530
He's like right here!

5146
03:52:48,830 --> 03:52:50,130
Our rocket ignored me!

5147
03:52:52,310 --> 03:52:53,350
Rocket, why?

5148
03:52:54,750 --> 03:52:56,550
I thought we were friends!

5149
03:52:57,290 --> 03:52:59,450
See, this is what happens when you ignore the Hella!

5150
03:53:00,850 --> 03:53:01,510
Oh no.

5151
03:53:02,550 --> 03:53:02,810
Oh no.

5152
03:53:03,130 --> 03:53:04,710
I got no He- That's what happens!

5153
03:53:07,630 --> 03:53:09,490
Why are you ignore the Hella?

5154
03:53:09,770 --> 03:53:10,390
We died!

5155
03:53:15,130 --> 03:53:16,390
Nah, that hero's about to it.

5156
03:53:24,790 --> 03:53:26,430
I got no John's back.

5157
03:53:29,350 --> 03:53:30,210
Oh my god!

5158
03:53:30,210 --> 03:53:30,330
Oh my god!

5159
03:53:30,510 --> 03:53:31,250
I'm okay!

5160
03:53:31,730 --> 03:53:32,510
I'm okay!

5161
03:53:36,950 --> 03:53:37,910
I'm okay!

5162
03:53:38,210 --> 03:53:38,710
I'm okay!

5163
03:53:39,490 --> 03:53:41,850
No he walked away from me!

5164
03:53:42,150 --> 03:53:43,570
He walked away!

5165
03:53:44,830 --> 03:53:47,650
That's why I was like, why did he walk away from me?

5166
03:53:49,370 --> 03:53:49,930
Oh...

5167
03:53:55,090 --> 03:53:56,110
Where's Arihalla?

5168
03:54:04,710 --> 03:54:05,270
Nice.

5169
03:54:06,230 --> 03:54:08,170
Like, how did Arihalla kill people?

5170
03:54:08,350 --> 03:54:09,430
Uh, one Thai Asian bitch, yeah.

5171
03:54:10,030 --> 03:54:10,350
What?

5172
03:54:14,830 --> 03:54:15,670
Excuse me?

5173
03:54:23,740 --> 03:54:26,620
Oh my god, I don't... I don't trust this is sacking.

5174
03:54:26,760 --> 03:54:27,920
I don't trust this is sacking.

5175
03:54:28,120 --> 03:54:28,680
I...

5176
03:54:30,880 --> 03:54:33,060
I just... I couldn't trust this anymore.

5177
03:54:33,840 --> 03:54:36,060
I... I made a decision.

5178
03:54:38,720 --> 03:54:39,280
Where?

5179
03:54:40,840 --> 03:54:41,820
I'm sorry.

5180
03:54:43,680 --> 03:54:45,040
I couldn't trust.

5181
03:54:45,320 --> 03:54:46,880
I have trust issues.

5182
03:54:47,020 --> 03:54:47,520
I'm sorry.

5183
03:54:47,520 --> 03:54:47,560
Alright.

5184
03:54:53,810 --> 03:54:54,830
I have ult here.

5185
03:54:55,590 --> 03:54:56,790
I'm with you on the Psylocke.

5186
03:54:57,270 --> 03:54:57,570
Okay.

5187
03:55:08,220 --> 03:55:09,460
Psylocke still wants our back here.

5188
03:55:09,680 --> 03:55:09,980
They did.

5189
03:55:11,360 --> 03:55:12,760
Let's drop down, buddy.

5190
03:55:14,440 --> 03:55:14,920
Alright.

5191
03:55:15,240 --> 03:55:16,600
There's the Psylocke.

5192
03:55:22,830 --> 03:55:23,250
Nice.

5193
03:55:24,290 --> 03:55:25,050
I think they're gonna...

5194
03:55:25,050 --> 03:55:26,090
Oh, they went strange, yeah.

5195
03:55:35,820 --> 03:55:36,600
Okay, that's good.

5196
03:55:37,160 --> 03:55:38,040
Got scared there.

5197
03:55:41,340 --> 03:55:42,980
Get Mr. Businessman!

5198
03:55:44,440 --> 03:55:46,380
The current score is...

5199
03:55:46,380 --> 03:55:47,080
Zero!

5200
03:55:47,660 --> 03:55:49,100
I'm holding my breath that whole fight.

5201
03:55:50,980 --> 03:55:51,420
Alright.

5202
03:55:51,720 --> 03:55:52,960
I'm currently...

5203
03:55:53,480 --> 03:55:54,240
Celestial 2.

5204
03:55:55,120 --> 03:55:56,360
Which is like...

5205
03:55:56,360 --> 03:55:58,340
Where top 500 is at right now.

5206
03:55:58,960 --> 03:55:59,920
But it's like...

5207
03:55:59,920 --> 03:56:01,740
Middle of Celestial 2, where he's at.

5208
03:56:01,840 --> 03:56:03,040
I'm not in the middle, I'm at the bottom.

5209
03:56:04,680 --> 03:56:08,080
That's the one Lucky Games, but it's also at 4 in the morning.

5210
03:56:09,200 --> 03:56:11,960
So games are gonna be very rough at 4 in the morning.

5211
03:56:14,940 --> 03:56:15,880
It's like no...

5212
03:56:15,880 --> 03:56:17,800
It's almost like nobody's queuing at this time.

5213
03:56:18,060 --> 03:56:18,620
That's so weird.

5214
03:56:19,900 --> 03:56:21,000
The cry never stops, though.

5215
03:56:21,800 --> 03:56:22,400
Give me a water.

5216
03:56:30,960 --> 03:56:32,680
...to have an all-superhero band?

5217
03:56:41,300 --> 03:56:43,140
30 seconds before you attack.

5218
03:56:43,360 --> 03:56:43,960
Get ready!

5219
03:56:45,280 --> 03:56:49,760
I people look forward to the...

5220
03:56:50,540 --> 03:56:54,100
Too bad I can't have you in my realm, little king.

5221
03:56:54,560 --> 03:56:56,440
I've faded back in time.

5222
03:57:01,160 --> 03:57:01,880
Yay!

5223
03:57:02,520 --> 03:57:03,680
DJ and our...

5224
03:57:03,680 --> 03:57:03,800
Yay!

5225
03:57:03,800 --> 03:57:05,280
DJ and our...

5226
03:57:05,280 --> 03:57:06,760
The battle starts in 5.

5227
03:57:07,420 --> 03:57:07,780
4...

5228
03:57:08,360 --> 03:57:08,720
3...

5229
03:57:09,680 --> 03:57:10,400
2...

5230
03:57:10,400 --> 03:57:10,760
1!

5231
03:57:11,080 --> 03:57:12,160
Alright, I'm ready.

5232
03:57:13,140 --> 03:57:13,560
Alright.

5233
03:57:14,380 --> 03:57:15,160
That's cool.

5234
03:57:16,640 --> 03:57:17,700
Alright, I'm ready.

5235
03:57:20,340 --> 03:57:22,100
Okay, I'm ready for real.

5236
03:57:23,560 --> 03:57:24,120
And iron.

5237
03:57:30,720 --> 03:57:32,100
Oh, they have iron?

5238
03:57:32,820 --> 03:57:36,580
What the fu- What the fu- What the fu- What

5239
03:57:39,680 --> 03:57:40,820
the fu- What happened?

5240
03:57:43,850 --> 03:57:45,190
Wait, isn't- Oh yeah, Mr. Big Moon.

5241
03:57:50,880 --> 03:57:51,160
Okay.

5242
03:57:51,720 --> 03:57:52,760
All prey has been located.

5243
03:57:54,340 --> 03:57:54,760
Yeah!

5244
03:57:55,820 --> 03:57:56,600
No, yeah, I did.

5245
03:57:56,880 --> 03:57:58,720
I-I-I get very-I got very deleted.

5246
03:58:02,560 --> 03:58:11,090
I'm trying to like- Oh my god, I can't use my clap anywhere cause nobody's looking at me.

5247
03:58:15,350 --> 03:58:15,790
Oh!

5248
03:58:16,350 --> 03:58:17,350
I think our team might be dead.

5249
03:58:17,570 --> 03:58:18,050
Ha-he!

5250
03:58:18,510 --> 03:58:19,210
Oh no.

5251
03:58:19,490 --> 03:58:19,870
This is bad.

5252
03:58:20,950 --> 03:58:21,370
Yeah, no.

5253
03:58:21,470 --> 03:58:21,730
We're dead.

5254
03:58:21,930 --> 03:58:22,150
We're dead.

5255
03:58:22,290 --> 03:58:23,230
We're dead!

5256
03:58:30,440 --> 03:58:31,260
This is...

5257
03:58:31,260 --> 03:58:32,440
A lot of damage!

5258
03:58:33,000 --> 03:58:35,040
Someone needs a snowball in the face.

5259
03:58:35,040 --> 03:58:35,560
starting to fight.

5260
03:58:35,560 --> 03:58:36,000
Alright, I'll wait.

5261
03:58:37,720 --> 03:58:38,540
I can wait.

5262
03:58:38,700 --> 03:58:39,080
I'm patient.

5263
03:58:42,680 --> 03:58:43,680
Where are are we...

5264
03:58:43,680 --> 03:58:45,940
How's-山 Continents.

5265
03:58:48,500 --> 03:58:49,540
Like, I...

5266
03:58:49,540 --> 03:58:50,160
I...

5267
03:58:53,620 --> 03:58:54,660
I can't...

5268
03:58:54,660 --> 03:58:57,140
Like just, there was nothing I could do.

5269
03:58:57,440 --> 03:59:02,040
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

5270
03:59:03,420 --> 03:59:05,760
Okay, we need to, like, dive together.

5271
03:59:07,180 --> 03:59:08,440
I'm down, call a target.

5272
03:59:08,820 --> 03:59:10,760
Oh, so Aura, thank you for the five, give the subs.

5273
03:59:11,080 --> 03:59:12,020
Thank you, thank you.

5274
03:59:16,160 --> 03:59:17,160
I hear him.

5275
03:59:18,040 --> 03:59:19,600
I knew it.

5276
03:59:22,400 --> 03:59:23,920
I knew you were around.

5277
03:59:26,500 --> 03:59:26,960
Okay.

5278
03:59:28,540 --> 03:59:29,400
Hey, guys.

5279
03:59:31,320 --> 03:59:32,700
Um... I'm going back on her.

5280
03:59:32,820 --> 03:59:33,300
Just having to roll.

5281
03:59:33,300 --> 03:59:33,620
Okay.

5282
03:59:34,540 --> 03:59:34,940
Nice.

5283
03:59:35,140 --> 03:59:35,560
I'm alive.

5284
03:59:38,480 --> 03:59:39,600
Oh, my God.

5285
03:59:39,920 --> 03:59:40,700
I'll hit him all with that.

5286
03:59:44,480 --> 03:59:45,060
That's good.

5287
03:59:48,400 --> 03:59:52,120
What am I... Punch that fucker.

5288
03:59:52,440 --> 03:59:53,180
Oh, thank God.

5289
03:59:54,340 --> 03:59:55,720
I gotta take it to the real Hulk.

5290
04:00:00,480 --> 04:00:00,880
Okay.

5291
04:00:01,440 --> 04:00:02,680
We saw a mile up.

5292
04:00:03,340 --> 04:00:03,940
He's on top, yeah.

5293
04:00:06,800 --> 04:00:07,720
I promise you won't reach the way.

5294
04:00:07,720 --> 04:00:08,480
Watch me so.

5295
04:00:09,420 --> 04:00:10,160
Almost there.

5296
04:00:10,420 --> 04:00:11,240
Don't turn back now.

5297
04:00:11,420 --> 04:00:11,720
Nice.

5298
04:00:12,420 --> 04:00:13,640
They're stacking the work out of there.

5299
04:00:13,760 --> 04:00:14,460
I want the RNG.

5300
04:00:20,100 --> 04:00:21,420
I have to use that.

5301
04:00:21,580 --> 04:00:23,560
I... I could... I saw them.

5302
04:00:24,040 --> 04:00:25,620
I saw it in their eyes.

5303
04:00:27,220 --> 04:00:28,680
I saw it in their eyes.

5304
04:00:28,840 --> 04:00:30,220
They wanted to do things.

5305
04:00:30,820 --> 04:00:32,080
They want...

5306
04:00:33,080 --> 04:00:35,360
If I did it all, I'd be dead.

5307
04:00:36,000 --> 04:00:37,160
I... I could see it.

5308
04:00:37,780 --> 04:00:38,900
Their eyes.

5309
04:00:42,000 --> 04:00:43,400
They want it.

5310
04:00:44,600 --> 04:00:46,220
They were bloodthirsty.

5311
04:00:55,260 --> 04:00:55,820
Alright.

5312
04:00:56,800 --> 04:00:57,760
He's going for it now.

5313
04:00:59,880 --> 04:01:00,980
Goodbye, everybody.

5314
04:01:01,240 --> 04:01:02,180
Goodbye, everybody.

5315
04:01:02,360 --> 04:01:03,460
We were not stacking this.

5316
04:01:03,460 --> 04:01:04,420
We were not.

5317
04:01:08,990 --> 04:01:10,390
Oh my God.

5318
04:01:10,730 --> 04:01:11,710
I'll patch you up.

5319
04:01:11,850 --> 04:01:13,930
Someone needs a snowball in the face.

5320
04:01:14,050 --> 04:01:15,470
Someone scratch my back.

5321
04:01:15,530 --> 04:01:18,050
Someone killed their Luna nine times too.

5322
04:01:21,550 --> 04:01:22,210
Okay.

5323
04:01:24,450 --> 04:01:26,050
Holy shit.

5324
04:01:30,290 --> 04:01:31,750
Like, I can't do it.

5325
04:01:34,530 --> 04:01:35,750
Oh my God.

5326
04:01:36,890 --> 04:01:38,410
That's so much damage.

5327
04:01:41,190 --> 04:01:42,990
What the fuck was that no-reg though?

5328
04:01:46,350 --> 04:01:49,530
I hate it when you get no-reg though sometimes.

5329
04:01:52,330 --> 04:01:53,410
I hear somebody.

5330
04:01:55,870 --> 04:01:56,590
I hear him.

5331
04:01:57,870 --> 04:01:58,870
I hear him.

5332
04:01:58,930 --> 04:01:59,810
I'm not crazy.

5333
04:01:59,810 --> 04:02:01,530
You're halfway there.

5334
04:02:01,630 --> 04:02:02,310
Keep going.

5335
04:02:05,520 --> 04:02:06,680
I hear him.

5336
04:02:07,540 --> 04:02:08,460
I know.

5337
04:02:13,590 --> 04:02:14,210
Okay.

5338
04:02:14,570 --> 04:02:15,350
I have to make sure.

5339
04:02:23,760 --> 04:02:25,380
Please, please, please look.

5340
04:02:25,380 --> 04:02:26,640
You're welcome, welcome.

5341
04:02:28,720 --> 04:02:29,280
Welcome, welcome.

5342
04:02:30,180 --> 04:02:30,580
My God.

5343
04:02:32,540 --> 04:02:33,140
Don't let me die.

5344
04:02:33,220 --> 04:02:33,600
Don't let me die.

5345
04:02:33,700 --> 04:02:34,080
Don't let me die.

5346
04:02:37,160 --> 04:02:37,900
Oh my God.

5347
04:02:40,260 --> 04:02:40,540
Oh.

5348
04:02:40,540 --> 04:02:42,920
Come out.

5349
04:02:52,860 --> 04:02:55,580
Please stack, please stack, please stack, please stack, please stack, no!

5350
04:03:06,490 --> 04:03:08,430
Oh no, one last fight!

5351
04:03:10,550 --> 04:03:12,530
They used both support ults.

5352
04:03:12,730 --> 04:03:14,410
They used Salak ults.

5353
04:03:14,410 --> 04:03:15,550
They used everything.

5354
04:03:16,850 --> 04:03:17,970
Oh my god, they banned Loki.

5355
04:03:18,370 --> 04:03:19,990
They fucking banned Loki.

5356
04:03:20,410 --> 04:03:20,970
Yeah, it's fine.

5357
04:03:21,970 --> 04:03:23,110
You know these good ults.

5358
04:03:27,520 --> 04:03:28,920
Probably have Lola, no?

5359
04:03:29,820 --> 04:03:31,120
No, no, they use it really easy.

5360
04:03:32,240 --> 04:03:32,880
Salak?

5361
04:03:33,120 --> 04:03:33,400
Okay.

5362
04:03:34,680 --> 04:03:36,280
Oh, that's unlucky.

5363
04:03:39,400 --> 04:03:42,260
No, there's a Namor behind us!

5364
04:03:44,160 --> 04:03:45,560
That's so unlucky.

5365
04:03:49,060 --> 04:03:50,960
I got it hurt by Namor.

5366
04:03:55,590 --> 04:03:57,230
Just gonna do that for my team.

5367
04:04:03,450 --> 04:04:03,750
Okay.

5368
04:04:06,710 --> 04:04:08,790
Oh my god, we won that!

5369
04:04:08,790 --> 04:04:10,070
Get the whole way!

5370
04:04:10,510 --> 04:04:11,830
One, two, two, one.

5371
04:04:11,830 --> 04:04:11,950
Oh!

5372
04:04:13,130 --> 04:04:14,810
No, of course they have...

5373
04:04:14,810 --> 04:04:16,210
No, they have to ban Loki.

5374
04:04:16,410 --> 04:04:18,650
Because Loki is such a good counter against Salak.

5375
04:04:18,810 --> 04:04:20,430
Another epic victory!

5376
04:04:20,830 --> 04:04:21,450
Thank god.

5377
04:04:21,670 --> 04:04:22,970
The other support died more than me.

5378
04:04:23,130 --> 04:04:24,550
I suffered so much.

5379
04:04:25,070 --> 04:04:27,950
I had to suffer so much.

5380
04:04:28,330 --> 04:04:29,350
Thank god.

5381
04:04:31,670 --> 04:04:32,750
Thank god.

5382
04:04:34,030 --> 04:04:34,910
That was...

5383
04:04:35,670 --> 04:04:36,550
That was...

5384
04:04:36,550 --> 04:04:36,810
That was twitchy.

5385
04:04:39,490 --> 04:04:40,750
Still got the W though.

5386
04:04:41,630 --> 04:04:42,070
Uh, Woodbird!

5387
04:04:42,190 --> 04:04:43,350
Thank you for that Twitch Prime!

5388
04:04:44,890 --> 04:04:45,330
Uh...

5389
04:04:45,930 --> 04:04:46,370
Uh...

5390
04:04:46,370 --> 04:04:46,730
Ooppy!

5391
04:04:46,790 --> 04:04:47,570
Thank you for Twitch Prime!

5392
04:04:47,690 --> 04:04:48,170
Thank you, thank you!

5393
04:04:48,570 --> 04:04:48,950
Taylor!

5394
04:04:49,090 --> 04:04:50,130
Thank you for gifting a sub!

5395
04:04:50,530 --> 04:04:51,870
To Slavia!

5396
04:04:52,090 --> 04:04:52,850
Thank you, thank you!

5397
04:04:53,610 --> 04:04:54,230
Oh, yay!

5398
04:04:54,350 --> 04:04:54,710
Rewards!

5399
04:05:00,000 --> 04:05:00,720
Plus 18.

5400
04:05:00,940 --> 04:05:01,860
It's because I didn't do that well.

5401
04:05:01,860 --> 04:05:04,580
I was getting, like, hard focused by Scylocke.

5402
04:05:05,700 --> 04:05:06,740
Wait, I get it.

5403
04:05:06,840 --> 04:05:07,760
I know what to do.

5404
04:05:08,260 --> 04:05:09,000
My C plus.

5405
04:05:09,400 --> 04:05:11,320
My record is, like, all over the place.

5406
04:05:11,500 --> 04:05:12,700
I know what to do.

5407
04:05:13,560 --> 04:05:14,240
What's your...

5408
04:05:14,240 --> 04:05:14,820
God dammit!

5409
04:05:14,920 --> 04:05:15,240
Okay, wait.

5410
04:05:16,120 --> 04:05:17,420
Okay, I'm gonna remember this.

5411
04:05:19,760 --> 04:05:21,100
Okay, level 64.

5412
04:05:23,560 --> 04:05:24,640
Alright, I remembered.

5413
04:05:25,660 --> 04:05:30,020
If I see that, I don't wanna play against Scylocke.

5414
04:05:30,020 --> 04:05:30,920
Like, I...

5415
04:05:34,990 --> 04:05:35,650
There we go.

5416
04:05:36,810 --> 04:05:37,630
Level 64.

5417
04:05:37,930 --> 04:05:38,290
Okay, guys.

5418
04:05:38,410 --> 04:05:39,410
Remind me that...

5419
04:05:39,410 --> 04:05:40,810
When we get in game...

5420
04:05:40,810 --> 04:05:42,150
If we see level 64...

5421
04:05:43,830 --> 04:05:45,050
They might change banners.

5422
04:05:45,190 --> 04:05:46,910
So, like, I don't trust, like, banners anymore.

5423
04:05:47,430 --> 04:05:49,390
But level 64...

5424
04:05:49,390 --> 04:05:51,650
No, my duo is not a Scylocke main.

5425
04:05:53,130 --> 04:05:54,010
He is...

5426
04:05:54,010 --> 04:05:55,190
A Starlord player.

5427
04:05:55,430 --> 04:05:56,430
But also, like...

5428
04:05:56,430 --> 04:05:56,810
Triple...

5429
04:05:56,810 --> 04:05:57,670
Starlord got nerfed.

5430
04:05:57,730 --> 04:05:59,030
And Triple Support got nerfed, too.

5431
04:05:59,030 --> 04:06:00,470
But he can play other stuff.

5432
04:06:05,230 --> 04:06:06,110
I believe.

5433
04:06:06,710 --> 04:06:07,450
Wait, they missed...

5434
04:06:07,450 --> 04:06:08,170
Mace got off?

5435
04:06:08,490 --> 04:06:10,430
One game and you got off, Mace?

5436
04:06:11,070 --> 04:06:12,650
Oh, two games and...

5437
04:06:12,650 --> 04:06:12,850
Oh!

5438
04:06:15,450 --> 04:06:16,670
Yeah, I get off, too.

5439
04:06:19,830 --> 04:06:20,790
Minus 26.

5440
04:06:21,490 --> 04:06:21,970
Jesus.

5441
04:06:26,010 --> 04:06:27,730
Yeah, I get off as well, guys.

5442
04:06:27,730 --> 04:06:27,830
Minus...

5443
04:06:27,830 --> 04:06:28,750
No, I...

5444
04:06:33,890 --> 04:06:35,130
I'd also...

5445
04:06:35,130 --> 04:06:36,310
I'd be mad, too.

5446
04:06:36,590 --> 04:06:37,190
Don't worry.

5447
04:06:43,830 --> 04:06:45,070
Minus 26.

5448
04:06:45,070 --> 04:06:45,310
Minus 26.

5449
04:06:52,990 --> 04:06:54,110
Wait, what is it?

5450
04:06:54,330 --> 04:06:55,330
Was it actually?

5451
04:06:55,650 --> 04:06:56,490
Plus 16.

5452
04:06:56,590 --> 04:06:56,930
Oh, yeah!

5453
04:06:57,190 --> 04:06:59,190
Plus 15 and plus 16.

5454
04:06:59,950 --> 04:07:00,210
Damn.

5455
04:07:00,530 --> 04:07:01,770
That's actual hell.

5456
04:07:04,790 --> 04:07:05,310
Damn.

5457
04:07:12,380 --> 04:07:14,260
I mean, it is a lot harder.

5458
04:07:14,520 --> 04:07:15,400
Like, the higher yen.

5459
04:07:15,640 --> 04:07:16,820
Because you'll gain so little.

5460
04:07:17,100 --> 04:07:19,120
Because there's not enough people playing in the lower trenches.

5461
04:07:26,060 --> 04:07:26,920
No, it's not...

5462
04:07:26,920 --> 04:07:28,360
That one wasn't performance-based elo.

5463
04:07:28,700 --> 04:07:32,700
It's more so, like, he was placed in lower celestial lobbies.

5464
04:07:33,400 --> 04:07:40,840
And because he's placed in lower celestial lobbies, you don't gain as much if you're in the higher celestial one lobby.

5465
04:07:42,580 --> 04:07:43,940
I mean, I can look at...

5466
04:07:47,360 --> 04:07:47,800
Jesus.

5467
04:07:48,040 --> 04:07:48,200
Oh, wait.

5468
04:07:48,280 --> 04:07:49,480
Oh, this was a GM game.

5469
04:07:49,640 --> 04:07:50,520
Oh, my God.

5470
04:07:50,980 --> 04:07:51,960
That's rough, buddy.

5471
04:07:52,220 --> 04:07:53,620
Oh, my God.

5472
04:07:53,620 --> 04:07:53,700
Oh, my God.

5473
04:07:54,360 --> 04:07:55,720
That's fucking rough, buddy.

5474
04:07:56,440 --> 04:07:57,780
Yeah, so, this was our...

5475
04:07:57,780 --> 04:07:58,760
This was the GM game.

5476
04:07:58,880 --> 04:08:01,140
I got minus 24, but he got minus 27.

5477
04:08:01,700 --> 04:08:02,720
Because, uh...

5478
04:08:03,540 --> 04:08:06,660
He was playing in, uh...

5479
04:08:06,660 --> 04:08:08,240
Because he was celestial one.

5480
04:08:11,920 --> 04:08:13,080
Yeah, higher loss.

5481
04:08:13,620 --> 04:08:15,620
Technically, you're supposed to carry your team.

5482
04:08:17,840 --> 04:08:18,620
It's alright.

5483
04:08:20,040 --> 04:08:20,840
It went alright.

5484
04:08:23,420 --> 04:08:24,240
I had fun.

5485
04:08:29,370 --> 04:08:29,770
Yeah.

5486
04:08:30,290 --> 04:08:32,110
Yeah, I have a lot of coins, but there's no...

5487
04:08:32,110 --> 04:08:33,290
Not really anything I wanna buy.

5488
04:08:33,990 --> 04:08:36,510
I wouldn't buy the Luna skin if it wasn't a battle pass.

5489
04:08:37,910 --> 04:08:39,610
We have to pay real money for that.

5490
04:08:39,610 --> 04:08:40,470
Hahaha.

5491
04:08:45,160 --> 04:08:46,420
Hello, roleplayers.

5492
04:08:50,620 --> 04:08:51,700
Hello, roleplayers.

5493
04:08:52,140 --> 04:08:53,220
I am here to hang out.

5494
04:08:56,930 --> 04:08:57,970
Hello, women.

5495
04:08:59,990 --> 04:09:00,630
And Loki.

5496
04:09:02,950 --> 04:09:04,270
Woah, what the fuck?

5497
04:09:13,300 --> 04:09:14,360
Level 64.

5498
04:09:15,460 --> 04:09:17,400
Which hero do you think you wanna be today?

5499
04:09:17,400 --> 04:09:17,700
Okay.

5500
04:09:19,180 --> 04:09:20,260
There's no...

5501
04:09:20,260 --> 04:09:21,340
Level 64.

5502
04:09:22,240 --> 04:09:23,440
That to worry about.

5503
04:09:24,380 --> 04:09:25,220
Oh, you're right.

5504
04:09:25,560 --> 04:09:27,600
Loki is also sometimes a woman.

5505
04:09:27,900 --> 04:09:28,180
You're right.

5506
04:09:30,720 --> 04:09:32,420
Just really wanna play Viz.

5507
04:09:38,580 --> 04:09:40,160
I low-key wanna play...

5508
04:09:40,160 --> 04:09:41,100
In Viz right now.

5509
04:09:48,450 --> 04:09:48,730
Alright.

5510
04:09:49,550 --> 04:09:50,070
Wait, it's 4.

5511
04:09:54,410 --> 04:09:54,690
Okay.

5512
04:09:55,010 --> 04:09:58,990
6, 7, 8, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 8, 9, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

5513
04:09:59,150 --> 04:10:01,070
That's 13 hours of sleep before my next stream.

5514
04:10:02,190 --> 04:10:02,530
We wanna buy a cap roll.

5515
04:10:04,450 --> 04:10:05,370
Yeah, we can do it with this though.

5516
04:10:08,530 --> 04:10:11,690
Why are you playing Viz or Luna when I feel like I wanna Viz?

5517
04:10:12,030 --> 04:10:13,370
Well, the meta...

5518
04:10:13,370 --> 04:10:13,950
Or Luna?

5519
04:10:13,950 --> 04:10:14,950
It just depends how I feel.

5520
04:10:17,930 --> 04:10:18,490
Um...

5521
04:10:20,270 --> 04:10:20,830
Um...

5522
04:10:20,830 --> 04:10:22,730
Okay, meta supports currently from what I was told.

5523
04:10:23,610 --> 04:10:24,170
Um...

5524
04:10:24,850 --> 04:10:25,410
It's...

5525
04:10:26,290 --> 04:10:26,850
Loki...

5526
04:10:26,850 --> 04:10:27,830
In Viz...

5527
04:10:27,830 --> 04:10:28,010
Luna.

5528
04:10:29,190 --> 04:10:31,310
Rocket is like okay, but like...

5529
04:10:31,850 --> 04:10:32,850
She's not like...

5530
04:10:32,850 --> 04:10:35,390
He's not like actually a good, good pick.

5531
04:10:36,630 --> 04:10:37,190
Uh...

5532
04:10:37,190 --> 04:10:38,810
Cause it's so easy to destroy.

5533
04:10:39,830 --> 04:10:40,670
It's so...

5534
04:10:40,670 --> 04:10:42,010
I feel like In Viz...

5535
04:10:42,010 --> 04:10:42,890
Can you play Luna?

5536
04:10:43,530 --> 04:10:44,510
Number 12.

5537
04:10:49,370 --> 04:10:51,210
A low key Luna...

5538
04:10:51,970 --> 04:10:53,610
Cloak and Dagger is garbage.

5539
04:10:54,010 --> 04:10:54,770
In higher elo.

5540
04:10:55,310 --> 04:10:56,510
She's only good in low elo.

5541
04:10:56,830 --> 04:10:58,050
Oh, okay, I guess not.

5542
04:11:02,630 --> 04:11:03,230
Okay...

5543
04:11:03,230 --> 04:11:04,250
I guess...

5544
04:11:04,250 --> 04:11:05,810
I guess not.

5545
04:11:10,910 --> 04:11:11,710
Um...

5546
04:11:11,710 --> 04:11:12,950
Might need no support here.

5547
04:11:13,550 --> 04:11:15,570
Says DPS Black Panther.

5548
04:11:15,830 --> 04:11:17,150
30 seconds before you attack.

5549
04:11:17,410 --> 04:11:18,010
Get ready.

5550
04:11:19,370 --> 04:11:22,430
We might need another support here.

5551
04:11:23,050 --> 04:11:24,930
When it's the fucking...

5552
04:11:25,990 --> 04:11:29,130
When it's the fucking Black Panther.

5553
04:11:29,130 --> 04:11:29,310
There.

5554
04:11:30,050 --> 04:11:31,130
No, we have to support.

5555
04:11:31,330 --> 04:11:31,550
She's fine.

5556
04:11:34,050 --> 04:11:35,270
I love it.

5557
04:11:40,130 --> 04:11:41,570
We're three versus our dive.

5558
04:11:42,150 --> 04:11:42,550
Four...

5559
04:11:43,050 --> 04:11:43,250
Three...

5560
04:11:44,110 --> 04:11:44,510
Two...

5561
04:11:45,270 --> 04:11:45,670
One...

5562
04:11:45,670 --> 04:11:47,790
All you need to do is capture...

5563
04:11:47,790 --> 04:11:48,130
You better be stacked.

5564
04:11:50,750 --> 04:11:51,550
Yeah, Widow.

5565
04:11:51,710 --> 04:11:52,190
This is Pearl?

5566
04:11:53,050 --> 04:11:53,870
Oh, this might be Pearl.

5567
04:11:53,930 --> 04:11:54,430
She's not bad.

5568
04:11:54,590 --> 04:11:55,750
I'm gonna have a good day.

5569
04:12:05,850 --> 04:12:06,890
All right.

5570
04:12:10,230 --> 04:12:11,290
He gets Razzler.

5571
04:12:11,970 --> 04:12:12,770
I'm lucky.

5572
04:12:13,770 --> 04:12:14,410
I'm going Widow.

5573
04:12:14,530 --> 04:12:14,850
I'm going Widow.

5574
04:12:19,070 --> 04:12:20,610
Oh my god, everyone.

5575
04:12:27,170 --> 04:12:28,990
I'm trying my best!

5576
04:12:30,270 --> 04:12:33,090
But there's also a Widow and I don't wanna get sniped!

5577
04:12:34,090 --> 04:12:35,750
Oh nice, I don't wanna get sniped now.

5578
04:12:36,030 --> 04:12:37,030
Hee hee.

5579
04:12:38,470 --> 04:12:39,290
Hello, though.

5580
04:12:41,210 --> 04:12:41,770
Yay!

5581
04:12:43,790 --> 04:12:45,110
Oh, they're running...

5582
04:12:45,110 --> 04:12:46,650
Rocket, Mantis?

5583
04:12:46,810 --> 04:12:47,730
That's not enough heals.

5584
04:12:54,220 --> 04:12:54,780
All right.

5585
04:12:56,480 --> 04:12:57,200
Let's go!

5586
04:12:58,140 --> 04:12:59,280
I think the...

5587
04:13:00,060 --> 04:13:01,220
Rocket is closer, I guess.

5588
04:13:03,200 --> 04:13:04,080
Okay, Rocket else first.

5589
04:13:04,280 --> 04:13:05,660
Rocket literally has his...

5590
04:13:05,660 --> 04:13:06,380
He has...

5591
04:13:06,380 --> 04:13:07,180
He's at like...

5592
04:13:07,180 --> 04:13:08,200
Double my rings.

5593
04:13:08,360 --> 04:13:08,860
Like who should...

5594
04:13:08,860 --> 04:13:09,660
Who all first?

5595
04:13:10,760 --> 04:13:12,760
I'm not even close right now.

5596
04:13:14,420 --> 04:13:15,020
Okay.

5597
04:13:15,640 --> 04:13:16,200
Okay.

5598
04:13:18,840 --> 04:13:19,440
Nice.

5599
04:13:21,620 --> 04:13:23,440
Oh yeah, that's what I'd like to see.

5600
04:13:25,820 --> 04:13:26,420
They're stuck.

5601
04:13:26,820 --> 04:13:27,620
They're stuck.

5602
04:13:28,740 --> 04:13:31,820
Matt, this is only good if like...

5603
04:13:32,760 --> 04:13:34,120
Oh, it's one of the...

5604
04:13:36,500 --> 04:13:40,120
I'm about to ult F4 and go to bed.

5605
04:13:40,900 --> 04:13:42,200
Holy shit.

5606
04:13:43,960 --> 04:13:47,420
Oh, it's the...

5607
04:13:47,420 --> 04:13:48,420
RIGSI!

5608
04:13:49,280 --> 04:13:50,720
What the fuck?

5609
04:13:51,220 --> 04:13:51,820
Wait...

5610
04:13:51,820 --> 04:13:54,520
Why did RIGSI get this random like...

5611
04:13:54,520 --> 04:13:55,680
Straight hate?

5612
04:13:56,920 --> 04:13:58,080
Out of nowhere.

5613
04:14:00,280 --> 04:14:01,700
He's just like...

5614
04:14:01,700 --> 04:14:02,420
Fight away!

5615
04:14:02,780 --> 04:14:04,240
Fuck you, RIGSI!

5616
04:14:06,600 --> 04:14:07,960
I like...

5617
04:14:07,960 --> 04:14:09,580
It was just out of nowhere.

5618
04:14:10,080 --> 04:14:12,160
It was just like...

5619
04:14:12,160 --> 04:14:13,880
Fuck my team.

5620
04:14:13,880 --> 04:14:15,160
And also...

5621
04:14:15,160 --> 04:14:17,300
Especially you, RIGSI!

5622
04:14:18,780 --> 04:14:21,060
That was so fucking random.

5623
04:14:26,660 --> 04:14:27,460
Awesome, Rocket!

5624
04:14:27,640 --> 04:14:28,760
Thank you for the...

5625
04:14:28,760 --> 04:14:31,420
Oh wait, thank you to your one sub!

5626
04:14:31,680 --> 04:14:32,540
Thank you!

5627
04:14:33,660 --> 04:14:35,060
That's so silly.

5628
04:14:36,420 --> 04:14:37,740
Like, out of nowhere.

5629
04:14:38,280 --> 04:14:41,500
He just really fucking hated one person in particular.

5630
04:14:42,450 --> 04:14:43,940
Oh, he's not gonna...

5631
04:14:48,640 --> 04:14:48,990
Hello.

5632
04:14:49,790 --> 04:14:51,610
I shall slowly push this cart.

5633
04:14:52,410 --> 04:14:53,470
You'll never know.

5634
04:14:53,830 --> 04:14:54,930
I shall leave now.

5635
04:15:01,410 --> 04:15:02,110
Nice!

5636
04:15:08,380 --> 04:15:10,040
Oh, I couldn't predict that.

5637
04:15:12,000 --> 04:15:13,000
I'm lucky.

5638
04:15:15,200 --> 04:15:17,620
I still understand the random...

5639
04:15:23,130 --> 04:15:24,090
Fuck you though.

5640
04:15:24,270 --> 04:15:26,790
Fuck you though.

5641
04:15:27,290 --> 04:15:28,530
Oh wait, what the fuck?

5642
04:15:32,250 --> 04:15:32,950
Oh no.

5643
04:15:34,250 --> 04:15:34,730
Nice.

5644
04:15:35,390 --> 04:15:36,490
Oh, I didn't see him.

5645
04:15:44,230 --> 04:15:46,790
I'm not landing my ices right now.

5646
04:15:46,930 --> 04:15:47,950
I think it's because of the time.

5647
04:15:49,630 --> 04:15:50,330
I'm helping you.

5648
04:15:51,850 --> 04:15:52,590
Thank you.

5649
04:15:55,870 --> 04:15:56,770
Oh, thank god.

5650
04:15:56,990 --> 04:15:57,790
Oh my god.

5651
04:15:58,070 --> 04:15:59,450
Oh, I'm not landing anything.

5652
04:15:59,670 --> 04:16:00,110
I...

5653
04:16:00,110 --> 04:16:01,330
Any of my ices right now.

5654
04:16:01,810 --> 04:16:02,690
That's not good.

5655
04:16:03,130 --> 04:16:03,330
Yeah.

5656
04:16:03,490 --> 04:16:03,930
You're magical.

5657
04:16:04,250 --> 04:16:04,590
You're magical.

5658
04:16:04,970 --> 04:16:05,390
You're magical.

5659
04:16:05,390 --> 04:16:05,530
You're magical.

5660
04:16:06,730 --> 04:16:07,810
Oh my god.

5661
04:16:07,990 --> 04:16:09,290
I fucking...

5662
04:16:09,290 --> 04:16:09,350
Please!

5663
04:16:14,790 --> 04:16:15,250
Oh...

5664
04:16:15,250 --> 04:16:15,730
Okay.

5665
04:16:16,030 --> 04:16:18,330
I need to, like, focus up on my freezes.

5666
04:16:18,330 --> 04:16:21,510
I'm not landing my luna freezes right now.

5667
04:16:22,450 --> 04:16:23,670
Which is not good.

5668
04:16:24,210 --> 04:16:28,580
I'm also, like, getting absolutely dove on right now.

5669
04:16:29,630 --> 04:16:30,810
Get that vehicle moving again!

5670
04:16:30,810 --> 04:16:32,290
This dive is not fun.

5671
04:16:33,410 --> 04:16:34,690
No, it's not normal.

5672
04:16:34,910 --> 04:16:36,350
It is not normal.

5673
04:16:36,350 --> 04:16:36,570
I'm not...

5674
04:16:37,590 --> 04:16:38,770
I'm just...

5675
04:16:38,770 --> 04:16:40,530
Particularly enjoying Ravos.

5676
04:16:44,270 --> 04:16:45,630
20 times!

5677
04:16:46,950 --> 04:16:48,150
I'm going low-key.

5678
04:16:48,390 --> 04:16:49,110
That's it.

5679
04:16:49,910 --> 04:16:51,110
Oh wait, I can't.

5680
04:16:54,870 --> 04:16:56,590
I was gonna go low-key.

5681
04:16:56,850 --> 04:16:58,090
I was done.

5682
04:16:58,350 --> 04:16:59,790
I was done!

5683
04:17:01,230 --> 04:17:02,170
Wait, wait.

5684
04:17:02,390 --> 04:17:03,090
Mr. Funt1.

5685
04:17:08,290 --> 04:17:09,690
I suppose that helps.

5686
04:17:13,660 --> 04:17:14,620
Jesus Christ.

5687
04:17:17,040 --> 04:17:17,900
There's no way.

5688
04:17:17,960 --> 04:17:19,400
I was gonna say, there's no way I...

5689
04:17:19,400 --> 04:17:20,560
What was that?

5690
04:17:21,080 --> 04:17:21,200
Oh.

5691
04:17:23,980 --> 04:17:24,500
Okay.

5692
04:17:25,420 --> 04:17:25,680
Yay!

5693
04:17:25,960 --> 04:17:26,840
We killed one person!

5694
04:17:27,040 --> 04:17:27,200
Whoa!

5695
04:17:27,300 --> 04:17:27,920
We killed two!

5696
04:17:31,860 --> 04:17:32,540
Fuck, okay.

5697
04:17:32,780 --> 04:17:34,420
I need to go there.

5698
04:17:35,520 --> 04:17:37,080
I really need to focus up.

5699
04:17:37,860 --> 04:17:39,880
I'm, like, not happy with my freezes.

5700
04:17:41,100 --> 04:17:42,020
Or maybe it's because I just...

5701
04:17:42,020 --> 04:17:43,360
I've just been playing it way too long.

5702
04:17:47,980 --> 04:17:49,020
Oh my god!

5703
04:17:50,040 --> 04:17:50,520
Ahhhh!

5704
04:17:51,200 --> 04:17:52,940
God, get me off this point.

5705
04:17:57,280 --> 04:17:57,760
Ahhhh!

5706
04:17:59,520 --> 04:18:02,140
I missed Doki when she could land freezes.

5707
04:18:02,920 --> 04:18:04,720
You remember those good old days?

5708
04:18:04,720 --> 04:18:07,320
This is real fucking boy!

5709
04:18:08,720 --> 04:18:09,060
Ha!

5710
04:18:10,540 --> 04:18:11,660
Oh my god, I landed somebody.

5711
04:18:11,820 --> 04:18:12,060
I...

5712
04:18:12,060 --> 04:18:12,760
I did it.

5713
04:18:13,120 --> 04:18:13,860
But I'll die.

5714
04:18:16,940 --> 04:18:18,220
We have...

5715
04:18:18,220 --> 04:18:18,440
Okay.

5716
04:18:23,150 --> 04:18:24,190
It's fine.

5717
04:18:25,850 --> 04:18:27,590
I'm low-key now.

5718
04:18:28,370 --> 04:18:29,010
No!

5719
04:18:29,210 --> 04:18:30,090
It's not fine!

5720
04:18:32,390 --> 04:18:34,250
I played too long!

5721
04:18:34,410 --> 04:18:35,870
I can't land freezes!

5722
04:18:35,870 --> 04:18:36,090
I can't land freezes!

5723
04:18:36,670 --> 04:18:37,190
One, two, zero!

5724
04:18:39,070 --> 04:18:41,010
Time to switch things up!

5725
04:18:41,590 --> 04:18:43,170
Including which side you're on.

5726
04:18:44,870 --> 04:18:46,530
I am Loki.

5727
04:18:46,790 --> 04:18:48,050
What'd you do to Sentry?

5728
04:18:49,030 --> 04:18:50,350
I have no idea.

5729
04:18:50,350 --> 04:18:50,750
I have no idea.

5730
04:18:53,270 --> 04:18:55,130
Bro, it's just...

5731
04:18:55,130 --> 04:18:56,230
That's so random!

5732
04:19:00,490 --> 04:19:01,350
Who's Tony?

5733
04:19:02,410 --> 04:19:03,790
Who the fuck is Tony?

5734
04:19:04,070 --> 04:19:05,030
Wait, Tony McLaren?

5735
04:19:05,170 --> 04:19:06,090
I got...

5736
04:19:06,090 --> 04:19:06,890
Oh yeah!

5737
04:19:07,650 --> 04:19:09,170
Oh yeah!

5738
04:19:09,530 --> 04:19:10,470
Fuck that guy!

5739
04:19:10,770 --> 04:19:11,790
Oh yeah, no!

5740
04:19:12,370 --> 04:19:13,750
No, I hate him too!

5741
04:19:15,650 --> 04:19:17,550
No, fuck that guy, dude!

5742
04:19:22,290 --> 04:19:23,730
Has everyone got beef with this guy?

5743
04:19:23,870 --> 04:19:25,070
Ha ha ha ha!

5744
04:19:25,550 --> 04:19:26,950
Ha ha ha ha!

5745
04:19:26,950 --> 04:19:27,330
Yeah.

5746
04:19:28,350 --> 04:19:29,590
Gormans told me about him.

5747
04:19:29,850 --> 04:19:30,450
Fuck that guy.

5748
04:19:30,530 --> 04:19:31,270
Fuck that guy in 30 seconds!

5749
04:19:31,530 --> 04:19:32,250
Stay strong!

5750
04:19:32,770 --> 04:19:34,630
Ha ha ha ha ha!

5751
04:19:35,930 --> 04:19:38,470
How nice of you to join out Ilyana.

5752
04:19:41,700 --> 04:19:43,080
No, that's a fucking lie!

5753
04:19:44,380 --> 04:19:45,600
What have you been doing?

5754
04:19:46,120 --> 04:19:48,220
Helping to run a sovereign mutant nation.

5755
04:19:48,720 --> 04:19:50,300
And I just had a manicure.

5756
04:19:53,540 --> 04:19:55,200
The battle starts in five.

5757
04:19:55,720 --> 04:19:56,240
Four.

5758
04:19:56,760 --> 04:19:57,140
Three.

5759
04:19:57,540 --> 04:19:58,120
Three.

5760
04:19:58,120 --> 04:19:58,160
Two.

5761
04:19:58,540 --> 04:19:59,120
One.

5762
04:20:00,120 --> 04:20:02,660
You have to stop them from securing the missionary.

5763
04:20:02,660 --> 04:20:03,060
Alright.

5764
04:20:04,960 --> 04:20:06,640
So there are two dudes, huh?

5765
04:20:07,500 --> 04:20:08,940
Sounds like overpopulation.

5766
04:20:11,660 --> 04:20:12,840
They're all so cute.

5767
04:20:13,400 --> 04:20:14,460
Yep, you're ready to go, Luna.

5768
04:20:15,620 --> 04:20:22,720
I'm gonna go in three, two, one.

5769
04:20:22,820 --> 04:20:23,140
Let's go.

5770
04:20:23,880 --> 04:20:24,460
Alright.

5771
04:20:25,300 --> 04:20:27,280
Had to use that, I guess.

5772
04:20:28,800 --> 04:20:29,940
Oh, Mr. Fan.

5773
04:20:30,380 --> 04:20:30,760
Oh, no support.

5774
04:20:31,400 --> 04:20:31,740
Yes.

5775
04:20:32,240 --> 04:20:32,600
Alright.

5776
04:20:35,040 --> 04:20:36,440
I have to reload.

5777
04:20:37,320 --> 04:20:38,360
Come on, the support.

5778
04:20:42,430 --> 04:20:43,290
Wait, what?

5779
04:20:46,070 --> 04:20:48,910
Oh my god, that scared me.

5780
04:20:50,070 --> 04:20:51,410
Oh, I can't do anything.

5781
04:20:52,310 --> 04:20:52,910
Noooooooooooo!

5782
04:20:56,860 --> 04:20:59,520
Oh my- oh, they're going hard, time.

5783
04:21:00,640 --> 04:21:02,440
Yeah, did you see that?

5784
04:21:02,440 --> 04:21:04,060
I was like, what happened?

5785
04:21:04,580 --> 04:21:06,340
My sound was gone.

5786
04:21:09,000 --> 04:21:10,900
I feel like we're not focusing targets.

5787
04:21:11,420 --> 04:21:13,460
My sound was, like, gone.

5788
04:21:22,290 --> 04:21:23,550
That was weird.

5789
04:21:24,610 --> 04:21:27,270
No, I- I- I was like, what happened?

5790
04:21:28,050 --> 04:21:29,350
I'm Mr. Fantastic as well.

5791
04:21:30,130 --> 04:21:31,030
And we're not getting anything.

5792
04:21:32,710 --> 04:21:34,110
I was so confused.

5793
04:21:38,470 --> 04:21:40,570
I am ready to put on a show!

5794
04:21:40,630 --> 04:21:41,250
It's Hooper!

5795
04:21:42,990 --> 04:21:43,590
Your

5796
04:21:49,090 --> 04:21:50,290
powers are mine!

5797
04:21:50,790 --> 04:21:52,330
I have to play him.

5798
04:21:52,550 --> 04:21:53,870
I don't understand.

5799
04:21:53,870 --> 04:21:55,010
Oh my god, nice.

5800
04:21:55,010 --> 04:21:56,170
I'll patch you up.

5801
04:21:56,170 --> 04:21:56,550
Okay.

5802
04:22:06,390 --> 04:22:07,150
Okay.

5803
04:22:07,490 --> 04:22:08,250
Um.

5804
04:22:10,690 --> 04:22:12,330
I- I tried.

5805
04:22:17,110 --> 04:22:21,650
Oh wait, nice, okay.

5806
04:22:21,650 --> 04:22:21,650
Okay.

5807
04:22:23,470 --> 04:22:24,610
All right.

5808
04:22:26,670 --> 04:22:28,970
Four more minutes of hell.

5809
04:22:29,570 --> 04:22:31,010
My favorite.

5810
04:22:33,470 --> 04:22:35,050
Oh, never mind.

5811
04:22:42,690 --> 04:22:43,610
Hello.

5812
04:22:44,670 --> 04:22:45,950
We shall help each other now.

5813
04:22:47,910 --> 04:22:48,830
Hello.

5814
04:23:06,150 --> 04:23:09,730
I have to fucking fight back, though.

5815
04:23:11,430 --> 04:23:13,630
Loki is so stressful sometimes.

5816
04:23:13,930 --> 04:23:16,990
I don't know how to play Loki correctly.

5817
04:23:25,410 --> 04:23:26,250
All right.

5818
04:23:26,370 --> 04:23:26,550
Nice.

5819
04:23:27,210 --> 04:23:27,890
Not nice.

5820
04:23:31,230 --> 04:23:31,950
Not nice.

5821
04:23:32,190 --> 04:23:33,130
Never mind.

5822
04:23:33,650 --> 04:23:35,270
Let's stop being nice.

5823
04:23:45,240 --> 04:23:46,160
All right.

5824
04:23:59,730 --> 04:24:01,130
Jesus Christ.

5825
04:24:05,730 --> 04:24:06,990
Oh my god.

5826
04:24:08,730 --> 04:24:10,150
Guys, I don't understand.

5827
04:24:11,810 --> 04:24:13,850
Oh my god, please.

5828
04:24:14,230 --> 04:24:16,970
My lap was gone instantly.

5829
04:24:18,090 --> 04:24:21,050
My lap disappeared so fast.

5830
04:24:26,910 --> 04:24:27,650
That's right.

5831
04:24:27,950 --> 04:24:29,310
I have many faces.

5832
04:24:29,310 --> 04:24:29,430
I have many faces.

5833
04:24:33,930 --> 04:24:34,490
Whoa.

5834
04:24:36,310 --> 04:24:36,870
Whoa.

5835
04:24:41,740 --> 04:24:42,300
No.

5836
04:24:44,540 --> 04:24:45,620
Jesus Christ.

5837
04:24:54,440 --> 04:24:58,940
Please, I can't, I can't position anymore.

5838
04:25:01,240 --> 04:25:02,140
No!

5839
04:25:02,280 --> 04:25:04,160
Luki died at 99!

5840
04:25:08,440 --> 04:25:11,720
Our rocket died at 99!

5841
04:25:12,920 --> 04:25:16,920
And our strange died at 99 too, that's so sad!

5842
04:25:20,830 --> 04:25:24,250
Oh my god, it just got off!

5843
04:25:24,250 --> 04:25:26,330
One, two, two!

5844
04:25:29,250 --> 04:25:31,150
I hate playing against Dive.

5845
04:25:31,850 --> 04:25:35,510
Literally, they went... they went more Dive.

5846
04:25:39,130 --> 04:25:40,630
Oh my god!

5847
04:25:44,870 --> 04:25:48,670
Their Dive was just... so much more intense!

5848
04:25:50,410 --> 04:25:53,390
I wish... I missed when they played Widow.

5849
04:25:55,670 --> 04:25:58,190
Why didn't he say Widow?!

5850
04:26:01,800 --> 04:26:03,080
Oh my god!

5851
04:26:04,760 --> 04:26:07,880
Why didn't they say Widow?!

5852
04:26:09,860 --> 04:26:10,500
No.

5853
04:26:11,120 --> 04:26:13,040
I have one more life.

5854
04:26:13,620 --> 04:26:17,920
If we lose this, then like, it's back to... we go try to get it back.

5855
04:26:17,920 --> 04:26:18,880
Hahaha!

5856
04:26:22,460 --> 04:26:25,980
Literally, the Rockin and I, we were literally...

5857
04:26:26,820 --> 04:26:29,680
We were literally trying so hard.

5858
04:26:30,120 --> 04:26:35,680
I felt like their... their backline didn't have to go through the shit I just went through.

5859
04:26:37,340 --> 04:26:42,260
They... their backline went through more fucking hell.

5860
04:26:42,260 --> 04:26:45,420
Like, their backline was just relaxed.

5861
04:26:46,020 --> 04:26:47,260
My backline...

5862
04:26:49,500 --> 04:26:52,660
My backline was like, fucked up.

5863
04:26:53,020 --> 04:26:56,220
Me and the Rocket... could not survive.

5864
04:26:59,200 --> 04:27:01,420
Which hero do you think you wanna be today?

5865
04:27:01,420 --> 04:27:02,180
Oh, I didn't see.

5866
04:27:02,520 --> 04:27:04,040
Guys, was there a level 64?

5867
04:27:04,040 --> 04:27:05,640
Because I was not paying attention.

5868
04:27:06,400 --> 04:27:07,440
It's two times.

5869
04:27:07,800 --> 04:27:08,300
I'm using a bathroom.

5870
04:27:08,680 --> 04:27:10,780
I'm using a bathroom a lot because I've been hydrating a lot.

5871
04:27:12,000 --> 04:27:12,480
Who

5872
04:27:15,960 --> 04:27:17,860
am I gonna banish from this match?

5873
04:27:20,300 --> 04:27:21,300
What are we banning?

5874
04:27:22,240 --> 04:27:23,800
Are we keeping torch?

5875
04:28:15,310 --> 04:28:17,870
You'll need a top-notch team to win this one.

5876
04:28:18,010 --> 04:28:18,750
Alright, I'm back.

5877
04:28:21,250 --> 04:28:21,730
Wait.

5878
04:28:24,630 --> 04:28:25,550
What is this?

5879
04:28:25,830 --> 04:28:26,590
Oh, we don't have torch.

5880
04:28:26,590 --> 04:28:28,030
I'm still going invis.

5881
04:28:28,990 --> 04:28:29,990
I've had it.

5882
04:28:30,910 --> 04:28:32,050
I've had it.

5883
04:28:33,170 --> 04:28:35,070
If I get dive...

5884
04:28:35,550 --> 04:28:36,590
I can right-click.

5885
04:28:41,540 --> 04:28:43,100
Oh my god, it's...

5886
04:28:43,300 --> 04:28:44,120
the shit again.

5887
04:29:01,680 --> 04:29:03,120
It's time.

5888
04:29:10,990 --> 04:29:12,110
Guys, look!

5889
04:29:12,210 --> 04:29:13,470
I'm squirting everywhere!

5890
04:29:14,250 --> 04:29:19,390
When this battle is won, Grant me the honor of investing you in combat.

5891
04:29:20,470 --> 04:29:21,510
Okay, buddy.

5892
04:29:22,310 --> 04:29:23,030
Okay, buddy.

5893
04:29:28,850 --> 04:29:31,510
It's the little things in life that give people joy.

5894
04:29:31,650 --> 04:29:32,410
Let him have this.

5895
04:29:33,590 --> 04:29:34,110
It's...

5896
04:29:34,830 --> 04:29:36,230
Small things in life.

5897
04:29:36,350 --> 04:29:39,690
If this is what makes him happy, then let him have that.

5898
04:29:46,150 --> 04:29:50,470
If that is truly what brings him joy, then so be it.

5899
04:29:59,100 --> 04:30:00,860
Let him enjoy...

5900
04:30:01,540 --> 04:30:03,040
what life has to offer.

5901
04:30:05,480 --> 04:30:06,580
Yeah, I need to focus.

5902
04:30:06,760 --> 04:30:08,100
Okay guys, I'm gonna focus up this time.

5903
04:30:09,540 --> 04:30:10,260
I'm so...

5904
04:30:11,300 --> 04:30:11,660
What?

5905
04:30:12,020 --> 04:30:14,000
Oh, it's cause he like, got off of it.

5906
04:30:14,300 --> 04:30:18,520
I was gonna say, how the fuck...

5907
04:30:18,520 --> 04:30:19,360
There you go.

5908
04:30:19,840 --> 04:30:20,080
There you go.

5909
04:30:20,080 --> 04:30:20,100
There you go.

5910
04:30:20,200 --> 04:30:20,900
Fight on the thing!

5911
04:30:21,640 --> 04:30:22,560
Jingle jangle jangle!

5912
04:30:22,660 --> 04:30:23,340
Fight on the thing!

5913
04:30:23,640 --> 04:30:24,860
Fight on the giant shield!

5914
04:30:25,040 --> 04:30:25,700
I got you!

5915
04:30:28,600 --> 04:30:29,980
You see that shield?

5916
04:30:30,320 --> 04:30:31,740
Jingle jangle jangle!

5917
04:30:41,370 --> 04:30:41,970
Jingle jangle!

5918
04:30:41,970 --> 04:30:42,350
There you go.

5919
04:30:44,530 --> 04:30:45,530
Jingle j...

5920
04:30:47,270 --> 04:30:47,870
Okay.

5921
04:30:50,350 --> 04:30:51,570
Where is my...

5922
04:30:51,570 --> 04:30:51,850
Luna?

5923
04:30:52,010 --> 04:30:52,230
Oh!

5924
04:30:52,370 --> 04:30:53,070
My Luna died.

5925
04:31:00,070 --> 04:31:02,310
I'll fight for my family until the end.

5926
04:31:03,310 --> 04:31:04,510
Jingle jangle jangle!

5927
04:31:16,790 --> 04:31:18,550
Alright, um...

5928
04:31:18,550 --> 04:31:18,930
What?

5929
04:31:21,190 --> 04:31:22,750
Where's my Luna?

5930
04:31:23,110 --> 04:31:24,710
Oh, there she is.

5931
04:31:25,650 --> 04:31:26,790
Okay, um...

5932
04:31:28,690 --> 04:31:29,750
I don't...

5933
04:31:32,450 --> 04:31:33,550
Oh my god, please.

5934
04:31:34,150 --> 04:31:34,550
Oh!

5935
04:31:36,450 --> 04:31:37,650
That's awkward.

5936
04:31:45,090 --> 04:31:46,890
Oh my god, that's awkward.

5937
04:31:47,650 --> 04:31:47,990
I...

5938
04:31:47,990 --> 04:31:48,730
That is...

5939
04:31:48,730 --> 04:31:50,550
Oh my god, and I got kicked against the wall.

5940
04:31:51,190 --> 04:31:52,790
Oh my god, double kick!

5941
04:31:52,950 --> 04:31:53,750
Okay, sorry.

5942
04:31:54,970 --> 04:31:55,290
Alright.

5943
04:31:59,570 --> 04:32:00,170
Please.

5944
04:32:01,290 --> 04:32:02,550
Jesus Christ, please.

5945
04:32:06,550 --> 04:32:07,150
Alright.

5946
04:32:13,010 --> 04:32:14,130
Alright, it's fine.

5947
04:32:14,130 --> 04:32:14,750
It's fine.

5948
04:32:17,590 --> 04:32:18,290
It's fine.

5949
04:32:18,450 --> 04:32:18,530
It's fine.

5950
04:32:18,530 --> 04:32:19,290
Everything is...

5951
04:32:19,290 --> 04:32:20,730
Not okay, but it's fine.

5952
04:32:25,210 --> 04:32:25,570
Clearly...

5953
04:32:27,830 --> 04:32:28,770
Oh my god.

5954
04:32:29,890 --> 04:32:30,890
That's so unlucky.

5955
04:32:31,110 --> 04:32:32,170
That's actually so unlucky.

5956
04:32:32,870 --> 04:32:33,570
Oh, wait.

5957
04:32:33,810 --> 04:32:34,390
I see nine.

5958
04:32:34,550 --> 04:32:34,790
Nice.

5959
04:32:41,090 --> 04:32:41,610
Please.

5960
04:32:42,290 --> 04:32:42,810
Please.

5961
04:32:42,810 --> 04:32:44,190
Oh my god.

5962
04:32:44,970 --> 04:32:45,690
The...

5963
04:32:49,890 --> 04:32:51,490
Oh my god.

5964
04:32:51,690 --> 04:32:52,350
Please.

5965
04:32:53,930 --> 04:32:55,210
I have to...

5966
04:32:55,210 --> 04:32:56,170
This is my heals.

5967
04:32:56,430 --> 04:32:58,430
This is my only source of heals.

5968
04:33:03,610 --> 04:33:04,670
Holy shit.

5969
04:33:07,370 --> 04:33:09,870
I have no other source of heals.

5970
04:33:14,220 --> 04:33:15,760
I'm just like...

5971
04:33:15,760 --> 04:33:17,400
I guess I die.

5972
04:33:20,920 --> 04:33:21,420
Yippee!

5973
04:33:22,060 --> 04:33:23,000
I pushed the cart.

5974
04:33:23,100 --> 04:33:23,860
Wait, what a bubble!

5975
04:33:24,040 --> 04:33:24,680
You're the best!

5976
04:33:25,540 --> 04:33:26,560
Oh my god!

5977
04:33:26,760 --> 04:33:28,080
It's like a little...

5978
04:33:28,840 --> 04:33:30,160
Amusement park ride!

5979
04:33:31,340 --> 04:33:31,840
Yay!

5980
04:33:32,960 --> 04:33:34,140
It is good against Dive.

5981
04:33:34,260 --> 04:33:36,360
That's why I fucking went in this.

5982
04:33:36,500 --> 04:33:37,780
Because I knew they were gonna go Dive.

5983
04:33:38,200 --> 04:33:40,780
Like, I knew, like, God hates me and that...

5984
04:33:40,780 --> 04:33:42,880
It would be Dive, yet again.

5985
04:33:43,260 --> 04:33:44,640
It's always Dive.

5986
04:33:45,760 --> 04:33:46,560
Nice deep freeze.

5987
04:33:46,960 --> 04:33:48,460
It's almost there!

5988
04:33:51,950 --> 04:33:52,710
It's almost there!

5989
04:33:52,710 --> 04:33:52,730
It's almost there!

5990
04:33:52,730 --> 04:33:54,410
This is real fire power!

5991
04:33:54,850 --> 04:33:54,990
What?

5992
04:33:55,470 --> 04:33:56,130
Disappear!

5993
04:33:57,150 --> 04:33:57,690
Oh my god!

5994
04:33:58,210 --> 04:33:58,590
How?

5995
04:34:08,160 --> 04:34:09,020
Oh my god!

5996
04:34:09,280 --> 04:34:09,920
Oh my god!

5997
04:34:10,060 --> 04:34:10,700
It's gone!

5998
04:34:10,960 --> 04:34:11,860
My shield!

5999
04:34:19,140 --> 04:34:20,260
Travel, travel.

6000
04:34:20,940 --> 04:34:21,700
What's he doing?

6001
04:34:21,960 --> 04:34:22,500
What?

6002
04:34:23,040 --> 04:34:23,180
What?

6003
04:34:31,040 --> 04:34:31,800
Okay.

6004
04:34:32,160 --> 04:34:33,080
That's good.

6005
04:34:37,290 --> 04:34:37,970
Good.

6006
04:34:37,970 --> 04:34:38,270
That's good.

6007
04:34:38,450 --> 04:34:39,190
She wasted that.

6008
04:34:40,650 --> 04:34:41,750
That's not good.

6009
04:34:41,950 --> 04:34:42,370
She's dead.

6010
04:34:46,950 --> 04:34:48,110
Oh my god.

6011
04:34:48,990 --> 04:34:49,670
Please.

6012
04:34:50,010 --> 04:34:52,230
I am peeling you as much.

6013
04:34:52,350 --> 04:34:55,510
I want you to know your entire life has been peeled.

6014
04:34:57,130 --> 04:34:58,890
Oh my god.

6015
04:35:00,510 --> 04:35:04,210
I'm actually trying so hard to peel for her.

6016
04:35:04,630 --> 04:35:06,130
You don't understand.

6017
04:35:18,260 --> 04:35:19,340
Oh my god.

6018
04:35:19,500 --> 04:35:20,560
We live here now.

6019
04:35:21,080 --> 04:35:21,660
We live here.

6020
04:35:21,920 --> 04:35:22,860
We live here.

6021
04:35:41,270 --> 04:35:42,650
I had to use that.

6022
04:35:42,750 --> 04:35:43,930
I didn't want our luna to die.

6023
04:35:44,890 --> 04:35:47,070
I had not enough heals for her here.

6024
04:35:52,010 --> 04:35:52,530
Please.

6025
04:36:03,380 --> 04:36:04,840
Where is the Psylocke?

6026
04:36:05,060 --> 04:36:06,460
Oh my god.

6027
04:36:06,740 --> 04:36:06,940
Okay.

6028
04:36:07,340 --> 04:36:07,620
Sorry.

6029
04:36:07,720 --> 04:36:09,560
I have to like super concentrate there.

6030
04:36:10,880 --> 04:36:13,120
I had to actually super focus that.

6031
04:36:13,760 --> 04:36:15,040
I... Dive is like...

6032
04:36:16,260 --> 04:36:20,880
Dive is like such a thing where my mind had to be like...

6033
04:36:21,860 --> 04:36:23,080
Please don't die.

6034
04:36:23,340 --> 04:36:24,160
Please don't die.

6035
04:36:27,080 --> 04:36:29,380
I'm just like... Please don't die.

6036
04:36:29,900 --> 04:36:30,340
Please.

6037
04:36:30,820 --> 04:36:32,340
Just... Please don't die.

6038
04:36:33,000 --> 04:36:36,340
I'm... I'm putting everything I got into you.

6039
04:36:36,640 --> 04:36:38,180
Just... Please don't die.

6040
04:36:38,180 --> 04:36:38,320
I'm gonna die.

6041
04:36:51,180 --> 04:36:52,140
Oh my god.

6042
04:36:52,360 --> 04:36:53,840
That was...

6043
04:36:55,200 --> 04:36:56,300
Jesus Christ.

6044
04:36:57,900 --> 04:37:03,640
The thing is, I can't use my shield for like anything else, but mostly for...

6045
04:37:05,820 --> 04:37:06,960
Oh my god.

6046
04:37:06,980 --> 04:37:07,980
That should have been.

6047
04:37:09,420 --> 04:37:10,620
I'm sad.

6048
04:37:10,880 --> 04:37:13,260
That was... that should have been a kill.

6049
04:37:17,120 --> 04:37:18,420
What the fuck?

6050
04:37:24,310 --> 04:37:25,770
Oh my god.

6051
04:37:35,810 --> 04:37:36,650
Yay!

6052
04:37:37,450 --> 04:37:38,750
Oh, not yet!

6053
04:37:41,630 --> 04:37:42,470
No!

6054
04:37:42,470 --> 04:37:43,750
Not yet!

6055
04:37:49,320 --> 04:37:50,980
Alright, I spoke too soon.

6056
04:37:51,540 --> 04:37:54,260
Guys, it was in fact... not yet.

6057
04:37:55,080 --> 04:37:59,120
It was... it was... unfortunately not yet.

6058
04:38:05,310 --> 04:38:05,690
Please.

6059
04:38:06,330 --> 04:38:06,870
Please.

6060
04:38:08,150 --> 04:38:09,030
Oh my god.

6061
04:38:09,770 --> 04:38:10,530
Please.

6062
04:38:15,430 --> 04:38:16,510
Not yet.

6063
04:38:17,370 --> 04:38:18,430
Just stay in this.

6064
04:38:18,690 --> 04:38:19,890
Just stay in this.

6065
04:38:25,330 --> 04:38:26,470
I hate Dive.

6066
04:38:26,470 --> 04:38:27,170
I hate Dive.

6067
04:38:27,250 --> 04:38:27,930
I hate Dive.

6068
04:38:28,030 --> 04:38:29,090
I hate Dive.

6069
04:38:29,170 --> 04:38:29,930
I hate Dive.

6070
04:38:30,950 --> 04:38:31,630
What?

6071
04:38:37,570 --> 04:38:38,970
Oh my god.

6072
04:38:39,890 --> 04:38:40,230
I...

6073
04:38:40,570 --> 04:38:41,070
Please.

6074
04:38:41,550 --> 04:38:43,890
How are any of them still alive?

6075
04:38:45,730 --> 04:38:47,810
I hate Dive.

6076
04:38:48,030 --> 04:38:50,350
The current score is...

6077
04:38:50,350 --> 04:38:50,850
3...

6078
04:38:50,850 --> 04:38:51,230
2...

6079
04:38:51,930 --> 04:38:52,550
0...

6080
04:38:52,550 --> 04:38:54,110
It's still not Dive.

6081
04:38:54,110 --> 04:38:55,190
Down to switch things up.

6082
04:38:55,310 --> 04:38:57,290
Including which side you're on.

6083
04:38:57,290 --> 04:38:58,390
Dive is...

6084
04:38:58,390 --> 04:38:59,130
Dive is a very...

6085
04:38:59,130 --> 04:39:00,590
Oh my god.

6086
04:39:00,610 --> 04:39:03,070
I'm not the type who fades quietly into the background.

6087
04:39:03,350 --> 04:39:04,470
The right heroes could make all the difference.

6088
04:39:04,490 --> 04:39:05,290
Dive is honestly...

6089
04:39:05,290 --> 04:39:05,830
Dive is...

6090
04:39:05,830 --> 04:39:06,730
Oh...

6091
04:39:07,290 --> 04:39:08,230
Hahahaha.

6092
04:39:12,830 --> 04:39:13,690
Aura!

6093
04:39:15,080 --> 04:39:16,700
Thank you for the 500 biddies.

6094
04:39:17,010 --> 04:39:17,270
Thank you.

6095
04:39:17,410 --> 04:39:17,950
Thank you.

6096
04:39:19,010 --> 04:39:20,750
I really appreciate it.

6097
04:39:26,710 --> 04:39:27,670
That's alright.

6098
04:39:29,890 --> 04:39:31,150
Oh, man.

6099
04:39:31,430 --> 04:39:34,470
I worked so hard, and then he decides to throw.

6100
04:39:35,150 --> 04:39:41,250
I love Marvel... She clearly... Peak Marvel Rivals experience right there.

6101
04:39:41,730 --> 04:39:41,990
Hahaha!

6102
04:39:46,930 --> 04:39:50,090
Clearly, that's my Marvel Rivals!

6103
04:39:50,910 --> 04:39:51,270
Hahaha!

6104
04:39:58,560 --> 04:40:00,500
Guys, that's why I played in this.

6105
04:40:00,760 --> 04:40:01,600
Because...

6106
04:40:03,460 --> 04:40:06,600
Because with Dive Meta, it's just not as fun playing Luna.

6107
04:40:07,180 --> 04:40:12,080
Because unless... In this, I can control my fate more.

6108
04:40:12,400 --> 04:40:14,280
Three, two, one!

6109
04:40:22,750 --> 04:40:24,930
That's my Marvel Rivals!

6110
04:40:27,450 --> 04:40:28,090
Coward.

6111
04:40:28,610 --> 04:40:28,910
Hahaha!

6112
04:40:32,330 --> 04:40:33,390
He didn't commit.

6113
04:40:34,130 --> 04:40:37,610
If you're gonna rage bait, at least commit a little.

6114
04:40:37,910 --> 04:40:38,430
Hahaha!

6115
04:40:38,430 --> 04:40:38,730
Hahaha!

6116
04:40:42,000 --> 04:40:43,120
What the fuck?

6117
04:40:44,040 --> 04:40:44,760
I'm...

6118
04:40:51,410 --> 04:40:53,910
There we go.

6119
04:40:54,250 --> 04:40:55,250
That's right.

6120
04:40:56,210 --> 04:40:57,870
That's what I like to see.

6121
04:40:59,930 --> 04:41:01,850
That's what I like to see!

6122
04:41:02,190 --> 04:41:03,250
Real rage bait!

6123
04:41:03,790 --> 04:41:04,270
Hahaha!

6124
04:41:06,810 --> 04:41:07,950
That's right!

6125
04:41:21,500 --> 04:41:21,900
Alright.

6126
04:41:22,120 --> 04:41:22,520
Alright.

6127
04:41:30,210 --> 04:41:30,250
What?

6128
04:41:30,250 --> 04:41:30,430
What?

6129
04:41:30,430 --> 04:41:30,690
Oh, okay.

6130
04:41:30,890 --> 04:41:31,050
Cool.

6131
04:41:35,170 --> 04:41:35,570
What?

6132
04:41:35,910 --> 04:41:36,510
I've got your back.

6133
04:41:36,790 --> 04:41:41,310
All prey has been... What?

6134
04:41:42,330 --> 04:41:42,730
Um...

6135
04:41:45,270 --> 04:41:47,690
What's... It gives you more ELO if you plus F5.

6136
04:41:48,750 --> 04:41:49,770
What's going... What?

6137
04:41:50,850 --> 04:41:51,890
Bro, it doesn't matter what I do.

6138
04:41:51,970 --> 04:41:52,450
I can't lose.

6139
04:41:52,670 --> 04:41:54,950
Even though I can go 0 and 20, I still won't lose.

6140
04:41:55,070 --> 04:41:55,550
I'm too good.

6141
04:41:56,110 --> 04:41:58,030
What the fuck is going on?

6142
04:41:58,790 --> 04:42:00,210
I'm locked on zero hours of sleep.

6143
04:42:00,270 --> 04:42:01,290
I'm crashing the fuck out.

6144
04:42:03,290 --> 04:42:04,710
I don't think he's okay.

6145
04:42:05,210 --> 04:42:06,050
Nobody cares.

6146
04:42:06,850 --> 04:42:07,170
Whoa!

6147
04:42:08,230 --> 04:42:08,790
I'm not doing good.

6148
04:42:08,870 --> 04:42:09,210
No, no, no.

6149
04:42:09,530 --> 04:42:13,030
I'm not pushing you after this game.

6150
04:42:13,090 --> 04:42:13,530
Denny, it's okay.

6151
04:42:13,630 --> 04:42:13,950
Bro!

6152
04:42:14,250 --> 04:42:14,250
Bro!

6153
04:42:14,250 --> 04:42:14,350
Bro!

6154
04:42:14,990 --> 04:42:16,650
I can't even wake up and burst my teeth.

6155
04:42:16,790 --> 04:42:17,490
Bro, what'd you say?

6156
04:42:18,050 --> 04:42:19,130
I'm getting on, bro.

6157
04:42:19,250 --> 04:42:20,250
I don't... Nobody likes you.

6158
04:42:20,250 --> 04:42:20,970
What'd you say?

6159
04:42:21,850 --> 04:42:22,670
Nobody likes you.

6160
04:42:22,730 --> 04:42:22,830
What'd you say?

6161
04:42:22,830 --> 04:42:22,830
Nobody likes you.

6162
04:42:22,830 --> 04:42:23,730
Why didn't you mute them?

6163
04:42:24,170 --> 04:42:26,150
That's the first thing I did when I went to the game.

6164
04:42:27,390 --> 04:42:29,350
You have a mute option.

6165
04:42:29,550 --> 04:42:31,770
Oh, oh, he muted me, right?

6166
04:42:32,810 --> 04:42:35,010
What the... Everybody get on that.

6167
04:42:35,350 --> 04:42:38,850
What the fuck is going on?

6168
04:42:40,390 --> 04:42:43,190
That's the first thing I did as soon as he said it's crap.

6169
04:42:43,590 --> 04:42:43,790
Bye.

6170
04:42:44,890 --> 04:42:46,410
What the fuck?

6171
04:42:49,190 --> 04:42:50,470
Like, what...

6172
04:42:50,470 --> 04:42:50,870
What?

6173
04:42:53,810 --> 04:42:56,010
I love marble rivals.

6174
04:42:59,570 --> 04:43:02,590
The peak rivals experience.

6175
04:43:03,430 --> 04:43:04,330
Let's go.

6176
04:43:08,170 --> 04:43:09,010
It's bad.

6177
04:43:09,190 --> 04:43:11,130
I'm just... I'll just be here.

6178
04:43:11,330 --> 04:43:12,390
I believe in him.

6179
04:43:13,110 --> 04:43:13,990
Oh, shit.

6180
04:43:14,150 --> 04:43:15,290
Oh, it's so big!

6181
04:43:15,570 --> 04:43:16,370
It's so big!

6182
04:43:16,810 --> 04:43:17,130
Hello.

6183
04:43:18,270 --> 04:43:18,910
Goodbye.

6184
04:43:19,290 --> 04:43:20,110
I'm running a lap.

6185
04:43:23,090 --> 04:43:24,690
Wait, how have I been left...

6186
04:43:25,010 --> 04:43:25,770
Wait, how have I been left?

6187
04:43:25,870 --> 04:43:26,490
NOOOO!

6188
04:43:27,410 --> 04:43:28,850
No, you are left!

6189
04:43:29,350 --> 04:43:31,150
What is going on?

6190
04:43:34,710 --> 04:43:35,350
What?

6191
04:43:36,410 --> 04:43:37,730
Okay, I think...

6192
04:43:37,730 --> 04:43:39,750
I think this...

6193
04:43:39,750 --> 04:43:40,670
I think...

6194
04:43:40,670 --> 04:43:43,510
I don't understand what is going on.

6195
04:43:43,770 --> 04:43:44,750
I think this...

6196
04:43:44,750 --> 04:43:47,090
Bro, the enemy team is throwing too!

6197
04:43:47,090 --> 04:43:49,090
What do you do?

6198
04:43:52,690 --> 04:43:54,270
Why don't you do that?

6199
04:43:55,030 --> 04:43:57,610
I'm gonna go duo with 7.62 and I love 7.62.

6200
04:43:57,610 --> 04:43:58,610
I'm gonna go duo with 7.62 and I love 7.62.

6201
04:43:58,750 --> 04:43:59,450
What the?

6202
04:43:59,650 --> 04:44:01,150
7.62, do you wanna duo?

6203
04:44:04,450 --> 04:44:07,030
Hey, hey, hey, hey, 7.62 and you are...

6204
04:44:07,030 --> 04:44:09,670
Okay, I have this relationship drama right here.

6205
04:44:10,010 --> 04:44:13,250
I have some random ass fucking relationship drama.

6206
04:44:13,250 --> 04:44:15,170
But, with some...

6207
04:44:15,170 --> 04:44:17,130
With, like, some...

6208
04:44:17,130 --> 04:44:18,050
E-couple.

6209
04:44:19,230 --> 04:44:20,470
It's some...

6210
04:44:21,230 --> 04:44:21,850
Like...

6211
04:44:22,630 --> 04:44:23,850
What are they called?

6212
04:44:24,330 --> 04:44:25,570
Is it E-couple?

6213
04:44:25,910 --> 04:44:27,710
Is this what E-couples are like?

6214
04:44:28,030 --> 04:44:28,710
Is it...

6215
04:44:29,670 --> 04:44:31,790
Is that what they are called?

6216
04:44:32,850 --> 04:44:34,070
E-daters, yes!

6217
04:44:34,450 --> 04:44:35,530
E-daters!

6218
04:44:35,770 --> 04:44:36,590
I just saw...

6219
04:44:36,590 --> 04:44:40,150
I think I witnessed, like, a very toxic E-dating relationship.

6220
04:44:40,150 --> 04:44:41,470
Like...

6221
04:44:42,150 --> 04:44:43,530
Like...

6222
04:44:43,940 --> 04:44:45,250
I just...

6223
04:44:45,700 --> 04:44:48,350
Is this what E-dating in Rivals is like?

6224
04:44:48,790 --> 04:44:49,530
Is it...

6225
04:44:50,080 --> 04:44:52,210
It's gotta be...

6226
04:44:55,090 --> 04:44:57,210
I think...

6227
04:44:57,800 --> 04:45:00,150
I think that is...

6228
04:45:01,960 --> 04:45:04,910
E-daters making it everybody's problem.

6229
04:45:04,910 --> 04:45:05,930
Yeah...

6230
04:45:05,930 --> 04:45:07,150
Yeah...

6231
04:45:07,150 --> 04:45:07,190
Yeah...

6232
04:45:07,190 --> 04:45:09,390
I think that's the sign.

6233
04:45:11,930 --> 04:45:14,530
The E-daters ruined my stream.

6234
04:45:14,710 --> 04:45:15,830
I gotta get off now.

6235
04:45:16,290 --> 04:45:16,710
I...

6236
04:45:19,830 --> 04:45:21,830
GG's GG things...

6237
04:45:21,830 --> 04:45:22,690
Thanks the...

6238
04:45:24,450 --> 04:45:25,170
Wait...

6239
04:45:25,170 --> 04:45:28,250
Don't end it on the E-daters!

6240
04:45:35,410 --> 04:45:58,190
Guys, if I'm, like, at a time where, like, e-dating... I'm at the random e-dating scene in Rivals now, I've hit the point where, like, I'm at the queue hours where, like, e-daters are playing at d-gen hours right now, having a public fight in a rake lobby.

6241
04:46:03,290 --> 04:46:08,930
And then, at that point, I realized I've hit my newest low.

6242
04:46:09,630 --> 04:46:15,430
That is the low I've hit, and I should stop there.

6243
04:46:16,650 --> 04:46:21,430
That's when I know I needed to stop there.

6244
04:46:30,490 --> 04:46:35,950
I don't even know what half of the things they were arguing... I don't even know what they were arguing about.

6245
04:46:36,550 --> 04:46:42,370
Like, they were, like, you were begging me to hop on, spamming me, and now you're throwing my game.

6246
04:46:42,370 --> 04:46:46,430
And I'm, like, I'm just, like, what the fuck is going on?

6247
04:46:46,810 --> 04:46:51,150
Like, I couldn't process it correctly.

6248
04:46:52,710 --> 04:46:53,970
Um, you're right.

6249
04:46:53,970 --> 04:46:55,150
It's free content.

6250
04:46:57,630 --> 04:47:02,070
Look, I came here to game and for Brotalk.

6251
04:47:02,270 --> 04:47:04,310
I'm not here for e-daters.

6252
04:47:07,190 --> 04:47:16,150
If I wanted, if I wanted to experience the, the wildlife of e-daters, I'd, I'd go to Valorant.

6253
04:47:16,730 --> 04:47:19,690
There's a reason why we're in Rivals right now.

6254
04:47:21,130 --> 04:47:33,030
I'd go to Valorant, or, or, we see them in Overwatch, where they do a Cassidy-Mercy duo, and then I ban that shit.

6255
04:47:38,130 --> 04:47:39,410
That's crazy.

6256
04:47:39,950 --> 04:47:43,370
Valorant e-dating is just people calling each other kidding and shit?

6257
04:47:43,590 --> 04:47:44,570
Oh my god.

6258
04:47:45,470 --> 04:47:46,030
Wait.

6259
04:47:46,590 --> 04:47:47,030
Wait.

6260
04:47:47,610 --> 04:47:49,130
That's so, oh my god.

6261
04:47:49,130 --> 04:47:55,350
Now, for Marvel Rivals, for Marvel Rivals, it really does reflect just how toxic it was.

6262
04:47:55,870 --> 04:47:58,370
Like, it really did.

6263
04:47:58,710 --> 04:48:00,150
Wait, I have a hype train?

6264
04:48:00,770 --> 04:48:01,570
Oh, fuck.

6265
04:48:01,770 --> 04:48:01,970
Okay.

6266
04:48:02,250 --> 04:48:03,110
Wait, that's awkward.

6267
04:48:03,590 --> 04:48:03,990
That's...

6268
04:48:03,990 --> 04:48:05,490
Oh wait, it's incoming.

6269
04:48:05,910 --> 04:48:06,610
Alright, no, alright.

6270
04:48:06,810 --> 04:48:07,890
I don't have to worry about it.

6271
04:48:07,910 --> 04:48:08,930
It hasn't even started yet.

6272
04:48:09,170 --> 04:48:10,790
It hasn't even started, so...

6273
04:48:10,790 --> 04:48:12,190
That means I can end.

6274
04:48:12,490 --> 04:48:13,170
Alright, guys.

6275
04:48:13,350 --> 04:48:16,070
For those who are new here, my name is DokiBaid.

6276
04:48:16,090 --> 04:48:17,170
I used to stream on YouTube.

6277
04:48:17,950 --> 04:48:23,930
I was streaming on YouTube earlier, and then I did 12 hours of Rivals, and I did like four to five more hours of...

6278
04:48:23,930 --> 04:48:27,590
I did like five more hours of Rivals here.

6279
04:48:27,870 --> 04:48:28,170
Sarah!

6280
04:48:28,330 --> 04:48:29,270
God damn it, guys!

6281
04:48:34,130 --> 04:48:35,610
Sarah, thank you for the gifted sub.

6282
04:48:35,730 --> 04:48:35,970
Thank you.

6283
04:48:36,070 --> 04:48:36,610
Thank you.

6284
04:48:36,750 --> 04:48:37,130
Bro sub.

6285
04:48:37,190 --> 04:48:38,190
Thank you for the hundred videos.

6286
04:48:38,330 --> 04:48:38,550
Thank you.

6287
04:48:38,690 --> 04:48:39,270
Thank you.

6288
04:48:40,870 --> 04:48:42,650
Okay, well, there's a hype train now.

6289
04:48:42,830 --> 04:48:43,570
Okay, that's awkward.

6290
04:48:45,750 --> 04:48:46,110
Perfection!

6291
04:48:46,110 --> 04:48:47,970
Thank you for the gifted sub.

6292
04:48:48,150 --> 04:48:48,390
Thank you.

6293
04:48:48,730 --> 04:48:49,130
Thank you.

6294
04:48:50,830 --> 04:48:51,670
But yeah, okay.

6295
04:48:51,850 --> 04:48:53,030
I was not...

6296
04:48:53,030 --> 04:48:53,250
Whoops.

6297
04:48:53,470 --> 04:48:54,970
Okay, I guess I'll be here a little longer.

6298
04:48:55,170 --> 04:48:56,030
No, we're not doing one...

6299
04:48:56,030 --> 04:48:57,670
Okay, if we're doing one more game, I'll do one quick play.

6300
04:48:57,890 --> 04:48:58,690
I'm not...

6301
04:48:58,690 --> 04:49:00,850
I'll do one quick play, guys.

6302
04:49:01,110 --> 04:49:02,230
I am...

6303
04:49:03,210 --> 04:49:05,850
I now know what kind of hours this is.

6304
04:49:08,070 --> 04:49:16,310
I went through so much in those 16 hours, and the e-dating scene was what made me realize I had to stop.

6305
04:49:16,610 --> 04:49:18,410
No one escapes hell.

6306
04:49:20,290 --> 04:49:21,570
No, we...

6307
04:49:31,710 --> 04:49:33,690
Like, I don't understand.

6308
04:49:33,910 --> 04:49:36,790
Why did the enemy team start throwing?

6309
04:49:37,350 --> 04:49:37,790
I...

6310
04:49:37,790 --> 04:49:39,610
I don't understand.

6311
04:49:40,770 --> 04:49:41,210
What...

6312
04:49:41,210 --> 04:49:43,070
What happened on the other side?

6313
04:49:46,790 --> 04:49:48,190
I just don't want to hear.

6314
04:49:48,710 --> 04:49:50,170
I just don't want to...

6315
04:49:50,170 --> 04:49:51,570
I mean, like...

6316
04:49:51,570 --> 04:49:52,030
I don't know.

6317
04:49:52,090 --> 04:49:52,790
It was like...

6318
04:49:52,790 --> 04:49:54,470
They were, like, arguing, too.

6319
04:49:54,710 --> 04:49:55,730
So it was like...

6320
04:49:55,730 --> 04:49:57,910
You know, like, those moments where you're like that...

6321
04:49:57,910 --> 04:50:00,390
Okay, this seems like a very, like, specific...

6322
04:50:00,390 --> 04:50:01,850
Like, specific thing.

6323
04:50:02,190 --> 04:50:06,730
You're at a friend's house, and then your friend and their mom is arguing or something.

6324
04:50:07,130 --> 04:50:08,790
And all you can do is just sit there awkwardly.

6325
04:50:10,290 --> 04:50:10,650
Um...

6326
04:50:10,650 --> 04:50:11,210
Do it...

6327
04:50:11,210 --> 04:50:14,610
Looking at your phone while your friend and your mom argues in the background.

6328
04:50:14,930 --> 04:50:16,330
Because you're sort of, like, stuck there.

6329
04:50:16,470 --> 04:50:17,830
And you can't really go home.

6330
04:50:17,910 --> 04:50:19,110
Because you have to...

6331
04:50:22,970 --> 04:50:28,690
You have to stop them from securing the mission area.

6332
04:50:28,730 --> 04:50:29,710
I was just...

6333
04:50:29,710 --> 04:50:32,730
Like, it's such a random, passive-aggressive fight.

6334
04:50:33,030 --> 04:50:33,340
But...

6335
04:50:33,630 --> 04:50:34,230
Yeah, yeah.

6336
04:50:35,130 --> 04:50:36,730
I was just like...

6337
04:50:36,730 --> 04:50:37,910
What the fuck is...

6338
04:50:41,290 --> 04:50:42,350
I was like...

6339
04:50:45,070 --> 04:50:47,150
What am I supposed to do here?

6340
04:50:51,110 --> 04:50:51,710
No!

6341
04:50:52,010 --> 04:50:55,010
His hammer fucking moved his...

6342
04:50:55,010 --> 04:50:55,490
Okay, nice.

6343
04:51:00,080 --> 04:51:01,200
I have to reload.

6344
04:51:01,400 --> 04:51:01,820
That sucks.

6345
04:51:03,760 --> 04:51:04,760
That sucks.

6346
04:51:04,860 --> 04:51:05,240
I have to reload.

6347
04:51:05,240 --> 04:51:08,240
I have to deal with Captain America in fucking quickly!

6348
04:51:12,680 --> 04:51:15,420
I already have to deal with him!

6349
04:51:16,380 --> 04:51:19,560
And now I have to deal with him in fucking quickly!

6350
04:51:21,120 --> 04:51:21,720
Like...

6351
04:51:21,720 --> 04:51:22,280
Bro!

6352
04:51:23,160 --> 04:51:25,320
Do you not have enough fun in Ring?

6353
04:51:29,960 --> 04:51:30,320
Alright.

6354
04:51:32,760 --> 04:51:33,360
That's fine.

6355
04:51:34,100 --> 04:51:36,260
We gotta wait until the hype train is over.

6356
04:51:36,400 --> 04:51:37,220
And then we can go...

6357
04:51:37,220 --> 04:51:38,640
And then we can all go home.

6358
04:51:39,120 --> 04:51:40,920
And then we play Super Mario, man.

6359
04:51:42,880 --> 04:51:44,300
Oh my god, the double stun.

6360
04:51:45,480 --> 04:51:45,840
Whoops!

6361
04:51:46,060 --> 04:51:47,000
Don't worry, I got you guys.

6362
04:51:48,740 --> 04:51:49,040
Yay!

6363
04:51:49,580 --> 04:51:50,540
Oh my god, Blackfire!

6364
04:51:50,720 --> 04:51:51,360
Thank you for that!

6365
04:51:53,520 --> 04:51:55,460
Thank you for the five gift of subs!

6366
04:51:55,760 --> 04:51:56,720
Thank you, thank you!

6367
04:51:56,720 --> 04:51:57,340
I really appreciate it!

6368
04:51:57,340 --> 04:51:58,180
I really appreciate it!

6369
04:52:02,080 --> 04:52:04,000
Wait, he just got out of that.

6370
04:52:06,740 --> 04:52:07,780
I'll use that later.

6371
04:52:11,870 --> 04:52:13,250
Dink, dink, dink.

6372
04:52:13,450 --> 04:52:13,870
What the fuck?

6373
04:52:13,950 --> 04:52:14,790
That should be a dink!

6374
04:52:16,150 --> 04:52:16,590
What?

6375
04:52:16,730 --> 04:52:18,130
Okay, I'm definitely no ready.

6376
04:52:18,350 --> 04:52:18,930
There's no way.

6377
04:52:19,510 --> 04:52:20,190
Oh shit.

6378
04:52:22,510 --> 04:52:23,230
Oh shit.

6379
04:52:23,730 --> 04:52:23,930
Alright.

6380
04:52:26,250 --> 04:52:27,130
Hello, everybody.

6381
04:52:28,870 --> 04:52:29,310
Hello.

6382
04:52:30,690 --> 04:52:31,650
Please don't hit me.

6383
04:52:31,790 --> 04:52:32,670
I'm just a little guy.

6384
04:52:34,410 --> 04:52:35,870
Can I hit them all the way from there?

6385
04:52:36,050 --> 04:52:36,750
God damn it, I can.

6386
04:52:37,930 --> 04:52:38,370
No!

6387
04:52:38,670 --> 04:52:39,070
He was...

6388
04:52:39,070 --> 04:52:39,550
Oh god!

6389
04:52:41,890 --> 04:52:42,550
Oh no.

6390
04:52:42,810 --> 04:52:43,290
Oh no.

6391
04:52:43,670 --> 04:52:44,310
Oh no.

6392
04:52:45,470 --> 04:52:46,090
It's fine.

6393
04:52:46,970 --> 04:52:47,730
I'm safe.

6394
04:52:48,530 --> 04:52:49,470
I'm not safe.

6395
04:52:49,470 --> 04:52:50,450
Oh my god.

6396
04:52:50,610 --> 04:52:51,750
Three, four people died.

6397
04:52:52,210 --> 04:52:53,050
We were not safe.

6398
04:52:54,010 --> 04:52:54,410
I feel it!

6399
04:52:54,530 --> 04:52:56,150
Thank you for the five gifted subs!

6400
04:52:56,310 --> 04:52:56,510
Thank you!

6401
04:52:56,750 --> 04:52:57,310
Thank you!

6402
04:52:57,970 --> 04:53:00,170
Guys, we were not safe, guys.

6403
04:53:01,610 --> 04:53:02,830
I made a mistake.

6404
04:53:05,350 --> 04:53:05,870
Hey guys!

6405
04:53:05,970 --> 04:53:07,330
Thank you for the two gifted subs!

6406
04:53:07,570 --> 04:53:07,650
Thank you!

6407
04:53:07,650 --> 04:53:08,530
Thank you!

6408
04:53:08,870 --> 04:53:10,110
You know what's crazy?

6409
04:53:10,470 --> 04:53:11,510
I've hit my fifth win.

6410
04:53:11,670 --> 04:53:12,670
You need to stop that vehicle.

6411
04:53:12,750 --> 04:53:14,230
I'm technically not tired.

6412
04:53:18,270 --> 04:53:21,450
How tiny is your fucking head?!

6413
04:53:26,270 --> 04:53:27,530
Oh my god!

6414
04:53:27,530 --> 04:53:28,490
Oh, he's...

6415
04:53:28,490 --> 04:53:29,050
Yeah, I was gonna stay.

6416
04:53:33,670 --> 04:53:34,570
Did you miss?

6417
04:53:34,890 --> 04:53:35,450
Oh, okay.

6418
04:53:35,550 --> 04:53:35,690
Nope.

6419
04:53:37,590 --> 04:53:38,030
Wait.

6420
04:53:38,450 --> 04:53:39,250
Oh, okay.

6421
04:53:39,310 --> 04:53:39,710
He was...

6422
04:53:39,710 --> 04:53:40,050
Okay.

6423
04:53:40,250 --> 04:53:40,910
I was like...

6424
04:53:40,910 --> 04:53:41,430
Okay, wait, wait.

6425
04:53:42,490 --> 04:53:42,930
Okay.

6426
04:53:43,290 --> 04:53:43,570
Alright.

6427
04:53:43,830 --> 04:53:44,410
Okay, he missed.

6428
04:53:44,550 --> 04:53:45,510
He didn't miss that.

6429
04:53:45,710 --> 04:53:46,650
He didn't miss that.

6430
04:53:50,130 --> 04:53:52,170
You were talking shit.

6431
04:53:52,670 --> 04:53:53,410
Alright, look.

6432
04:53:53,830 --> 04:53:54,270
I...

6433
04:53:54,270 --> 04:53:56,170
Might have spoke too soon.

6434
04:53:56,170 --> 04:53:59,610
I was like watching him miss and...

6435
04:53:59,610 --> 04:53:59,790
Look.

6436
04:54:00,230 --> 04:54:02,190
He hit the shot when...

6437
04:54:02,890 --> 04:54:03,930
When he needed to.

6438
04:54:04,210 --> 04:54:04,930
I agree.

6439
04:54:06,890 --> 04:54:07,630
Good for him.

6440
04:54:09,970 --> 04:54:10,570
Why?!

6441
04:54:15,150 --> 04:54:16,470
Oh my god!

6442
04:54:19,970 --> 04:54:22,750
He fucking booted him off!

6443
04:54:27,990 --> 04:54:28,590
Okay.

6444
04:54:29,870 --> 04:54:32,410
Okay, I'm just gonna be here and I'm gonna farm it here.

6445
04:54:32,770 --> 04:54:33,730
Until...

6446
04:54:35,490 --> 04:54:36,110
That's fine.

6447
04:54:38,770 --> 04:54:41,790
Stop booting him when I'm angling headshots!

6448
04:54:45,910 --> 04:54:47,590
It's actually fucked up.

6449
04:54:47,910 --> 04:54:50,770
Every time I have like the perfect headshot...

6450
04:54:55,810 --> 04:54:58,410
Jesus Christ, he lives forever!

6451
04:55:02,900 --> 04:55:04,420
He's gonna wait until...

6452
04:55:04,420 --> 04:55:04,840
Fantastic!

6453
04:55:06,680 --> 04:55:07,660
There we go.

6454
04:55:10,500 --> 04:55:11,720
Where is he?

6455
04:55:13,440 --> 04:55:14,640
Where is he?

6456
04:55:14,840 --> 04:55:16,640
I shall eliminate you!

6457
04:55:20,080 --> 04:55:20,440
Nice.

6458
04:55:24,940 --> 04:55:25,660
Nice.

6459
04:55:25,920 --> 04:55:26,560
Alright, there we go.

6460
04:55:28,260 --> 04:55:29,800
He is so fucking tanky.

6461
04:55:30,180 --> 04:55:32,280
It made me realize how much I...

6462
04:55:33,080 --> 04:55:34,300
I fucking hate it.

6463
04:55:34,400 --> 04:55:36,340
Why am I still in East Coast?

6464
04:55:37,160 --> 04:55:38,940
Where are my West Coast gamers?

6465
04:55:41,680 --> 04:55:44,420
Yeah, my ping is so high because like...

6466
04:55:44,420 --> 04:55:47,220
I don't know if you guys know this, but NA is really fucking big.

6467
04:56:00,590 --> 04:56:02,630
I should've just done...

6468
04:56:02,630 --> 04:56:05,310
I should've just done only West Coast.

6469
04:56:07,390 --> 04:56:09,030
Yeah, I'm one of those people.

6470
04:56:11,530 --> 04:56:12,550
The fact that...

6471
04:56:12,550 --> 04:56:12,650
The fact that...

6472
04:56:12,650 --> 04:56:12,670
No.

6473
04:56:13,270 --> 04:56:17,530
EU people almost get the same ping as me when I queue East Coast.

6474
04:56:17,690 --> 04:56:20,130
When they queue East Coast, it's almost the same ping.

6475
04:56:23,050 --> 04:56:24,770
That's what's the most fucked up part.

6476
04:56:25,010 --> 04:56:27,530
The fact that we share like the same connection.

6477
04:56:27,930 --> 04:56:29,030
Even though technically...

6478
04:56:30,250 --> 04:56:32,330
They are further away from me.

6479
04:56:34,730 --> 04:56:36,950
Hey guys, thank you for the two gifted subs!

6480
04:56:37,170 --> 04:56:38,070
Thank you, thank you!

6481
04:56:42,750 --> 04:56:44,290
Don't worry, I'm shooting the wall.

6482
04:56:44,750 --> 04:56:47,170
I'm doing something that no other people would do.

6483
04:56:47,310 --> 04:56:48,930
Because I know the support pain.

6484
04:56:49,610 --> 04:56:52,030
Of a guy that doesn't shoot the fucking wall.

6485
04:56:53,030 --> 04:56:55,250
Heal me, you simpletons.

6486
04:56:55,490 --> 04:56:56,970
I am barely harmed.

6487
04:56:57,430 --> 04:56:58,670
Get over here, Jacob.

6488
04:56:59,950 --> 04:57:00,830
Oh wait, you get healed?

6489
04:57:00,950 --> 04:57:01,370
That's legal.

6490
04:57:06,590 --> 04:57:08,170
That's fine, I got that one squid.

6491
04:57:11,290 --> 04:57:13,170
We got the one squid, yes.

6492
04:57:13,590 --> 04:57:14,210
It's okay.

6493
04:57:15,990 --> 04:57:17,490
We got the one squid!

6494
04:57:19,850 --> 04:57:20,690
There we go.

6495
04:57:24,230 --> 04:57:24,910
That's right!

6496
04:57:27,170 --> 04:57:27,610
That's...

6497
04:57:27,610 --> 04:57:28,370
Get over here!

6498
04:57:28,730 --> 04:57:29,350
Oh, never mind.

6499
04:57:29,750 --> 04:57:31,150
My team's dead, guys.

6500
04:57:32,030 --> 04:57:34,410
Guys, my team's may or may not be dead.

6501
04:57:35,670 --> 04:57:36,590
Goodbye, everyone.

6502
04:57:37,790 --> 04:57:38,930
I shall wash them, I'll die.

6503
04:57:43,400 --> 04:57:46,540
Oh my god, I almost wanted to get that raccoon kill!

6504
04:57:50,990 --> 04:57:53,150
Uh, Catgirl, thank you for the tier 1 sub!

6505
04:57:53,290 --> 04:57:54,050
Thank you, thank you!

6506
04:57:54,110 --> 04:57:56,070
Hey guys, thank you for another two gifted subs!

6507
04:57:56,210 --> 04:57:57,090
Thank you, thank you!

6508
04:57:58,150 --> 04:58:00,370
Oh my god, by the time I finish this, the hype train's gonna be over.

6509
04:58:02,910 --> 04:58:03,930
Nice, good timing.

6510
04:58:07,950 --> 04:58:09,670
I've hit my 5th win, so I'm not...

6511
04:58:09,670 --> 04:58:12,550
You know when you hit your 5th win, you're not tired?

6512
04:58:13,370 --> 04:58:14,830
Unfortunately, that's me right now.

6513
04:58:17,390 --> 04:58:18,410
Oh, that's not good.

6514
04:58:18,410 --> 04:58:20,550
I'm so sure that I am very hot.

6515
04:58:21,190 --> 04:58:22,530
God damn it.

6516
04:58:26,810 --> 04:58:29,230
Oh, there's too many squids!

6517
04:58:31,030 --> 04:58:31,730
Nooooo!

6518
04:58:32,870 --> 04:58:34,950
Oh, these squids!

6519
04:58:34,950 --> 04:58:36,270
That's it!

6520
04:58:36,430 --> 04:58:36,490
That's it!

6521
04:58:36,490 --> 04:58:37,630
I'm trying now!

6522
04:58:38,850 --> 04:58:39,690
That's it!

6523
04:58:41,670 --> 04:58:43,270
That's fucking it!

6524
04:58:43,910 --> 04:58:45,990
What do you mean this is my best DPS?

6525
04:58:46,970 --> 04:58:49,630
Well, Psylocke is, but my hands can't...

6526
04:58:49,630 --> 04:58:50,990
Doesn't feel like aiming right now.

6527
04:58:51,870 --> 04:58:53,430
I think, like...

6528
04:58:53,430 --> 04:58:56,290
Doesn't feel like doing, like, fast aiming at the moment.

6529
04:59:01,510 --> 04:59:03,090
Like, this is a lot easier.

6530
04:59:06,550 --> 04:59:07,830
It's a lot easier.

6531
04:59:08,650 --> 04:59:09,810
Cause I can do this.

6532
04:59:10,110 --> 04:59:11,830
And then that does my aim for me.

6533
04:59:13,190 --> 04:59:14,030
Like, I...

6534
04:59:14,030 --> 04:59:14,410
Look at that.

6535
04:59:15,230 --> 04:59:16,410
That aims for me.

6536
04:59:24,110 --> 04:59:25,230
Get over here, Luna!

6537
04:59:25,510 --> 04:59:26,530
Get over here!

6538
04:59:27,310 --> 04:59:28,330
That's fucking right!

6539
04:59:32,330 --> 04:59:33,630
Get your ass over here!

6540
04:59:35,210 --> 04:59:36,130
That's fucking right!

6541
04:59:37,570 --> 04:59:39,550
Easiest fucking character of my life!

6542
04:59:43,830 --> 04:59:44,770
Get out of here!

6543
04:59:45,930 --> 04:59:46,790
No, it is.

6544
04:59:47,030 --> 04:59:48,370
This character is so easy.

6545
04:59:51,750 --> 04:59:53,790
Oh, just cause you're in a fog?

6546
04:59:54,590 --> 04:59:55,790
Think I won't kill you?

6547
04:59:55,890 --> 04:59:57,630
I'm coming after you, Luna!

6548
04:59:57,790 --> 04:59:58,370
Oh, shit!

6549
05:00:00,950 --> 05:00:02,210
You live for now!

6550
05:00:04,190 --> 05:00:05,650
I saw the hell out of that.

6551
05:00:05,650 --> 05:00:07,090
I was like, okay, nevermind.

6552
05:00:07,990 --> 05:00:08,430
Nevermind!

6553
05:00:09,310 --> 05:00:10,050
You can...

6554
05:00:10,050 --> 05:00:10,990
You can have that.

6555
05:00:15,040 --> 05:00:16,300
Get over here, Dora.

6556
05:00:16,480 --> 05:00:16,840
Don't worry.

6557
05:00:17,420 --> 05:00:18,780
I shall speed you out.

6558
05:00:22,180 --> 05:00:22,620
Whoa!

6559
05:00:25,600 --> 05:00:26,040
Whoa!

6560
05:00:26,260 --> 05:00:26,760
Oh my god!

6561
05:00:27,100 --> 05:00:28,100
What the fuck?!

6562
05:00:28,100 --> 05:00:28,380
Okay!

6563
05:00:28,820 --> 05:00:30,340
That was a hate crime, too.

6564
05:00:34,630 --> 05:00:35,050
Alright.

6565
05:00:36,550 --> 05:00:37,190
Don't worry.

6566
05:00:37,890 --> 05:00:38,770
It's over time.

6567
05:00:39,610 --> 05:00:41,910
Things will always be okay if it's over time.

6568
05:00:47,600 --> 05:00:48,620
Oh, I can do this.

6569
05:00:49,040 --> 05:00:49,440
Yay!

6570
05:00:50,080 --> 05:00:50,720
Get out of here!

6571
05:00:51,600 --> 05:00:51,780
Oh!

6572
05:00:53,580 --> 05:00:55,280
This is a good ultrar to me, too.

6573
05:00:56,400 --> 05:00:56,900
Wait, what?

6574
05:00:57,000 --> 05:00:57,840
How did my team die?

6575
05:00:58,360 --> 05:01:00,420
By the way, I don't know if you guys know this, but...

6576
05:01:00,420 --> 05:01:01,100
Please don't look up!

6577
05:01:01,460 --> 05:01:01,920
Please don't...

6578
05:01:01,920 --> 05:01:03,220
What the fuck?!

6579
05:01:03,860 --> 05:01:04,380
It's...

6580
05:01:04,380 --> 05:01:05,340
Spider Time!

6581
05:01:06,680 --> 05:01:07,500
Oh, no.

6582
05:01:07,740 --> 05:01:09,680
I have to wait until after Spider Time's over.

6583
05:01:10,100 --> 05:01:11,360
Because, um...

6584
05:01:11,360 --> 05:01:12,320
If I actually...

6585
05:01:17,110 --> 05:01:18,210
They don't know.

6586
05:01:23,910 --> 05:01:25,410
Told you they don't know.

6587
05:01:25,750 --> 05:01:27,370
What if I just spawn camp the Luna?

6588
05:01:27,550 --> 05:01:28,810
I'm just gonna spawn...

6589
05:01:28,810 --> 05:01:29,130
Actually...

6590
05:01:29,770 --> 05:01:30,730
No, I should try.

6591
05:01:32,210 --> 05:01:34,210
I was, like, thinking, like...

6592
05:01:34,210 --> 05:01:36,450
I could literally just spawn camp the Luna.

6593
05:01:36,850 --> 05:01:38,010
But then I'm like, nah.

6594
05:01:38,010 --> 05:01:38,050
Yeah.

6595
05:01:39,570 --> 05:01:42,090
Now I spawn camp the Luna.

6596
05:01:43,750 --> 05:01:48,210
Now I sp...

6597
05:01:50,990 --> 05:01:52,390
That's fucked.

6598
05:01:52,870 --> 05:01:55,430
Fuck that living head in particular.

6599
05:01:59,990 --> 05:02:00,870
Yay!

6600
05:02:02,750 --> 05:02:03,970
I did my job.

6601
05:02:05,710 --> 05:02:06,110
Um...

6602
05:02:06,810 --> 05:02:08,270
She's the one...

6603
05:02:09,230 --> 05:02:11,610
I will not stop the cycle!

6604
05:02:14,550 --> 05:02:15,770
Can't quit on a win.

6605
05:02:15,910 --> 05:02:16,990
I'm ready to leave.

6606
05:02:18,470 --> 05:02:20,510
Agent, thank you for the five gifted subs.

6607
05:02:20,650 --> 05:02:21,390
Thank you, thank you.

6608
05:02:21,630 --> 05:02:23,250
Sumi, thank you for the tier one sub.

6609
05:02:23,370 --> 05:02:23,950
Thank you, thank you.

6610
05:02:24,010 --> 05:02:24,450
Alright, guys.

6611
05:02:24,650 --> 05:02:25,550
I'm gonna call it here.

6612
05:02:25,550 --> 05:02:26,690
That was a long stream.

6613
05:02:26,950 --> 05:02:28,450
I don't mean to do a long stream.

6614
05:02:28,650 --> 05:02:30,390
But something just hit me today.

6615
05:02:31,210 --> 05:02:31,650
I...

6616
05:02:31,650 --> 05:02:32,450
Some...

6617
05:02:32,450 --> 05:02:33,430
I got, like...

6618
05:02:33,430 --> 05:02:34,550
Sometimes I get into these weird...

6619
05:02:36,310 --> 05:02:36,750
Uh...

6620
05:02:36,750 --> 05:02:38,030
FPS shooters.

6621
05:02:38,470 --> 05:02:38,910
Or, like, whatever.

6622
05:02:39,010 --> 05:02:39,650
Because it's not FPS.

6623
05:02:40,070 --> 05:02:40,990
Shooter addiction.

6624
05:02:41,450 --> 05:02:42,710
And this was my...

6625
05:02:42,710 --> 05:02:43,910
I got into...

6626
05:02:43,910 --> 05:02:45,310
I got into the groove.

6627
05:02:45,310 --> 05:02:46,050
I...

6628
05:02:48,350 --> 05:02:48,830
Alright.

6629
05:02:49,130 --> 05:02:49,670
Hey, guys!

6630
05:02:49,910 --> 05:02:51,710
For those who are new here, my name is DokiBird.

6631
05:02:51,950 --> 05:02:53,870
Feel free to check me on YouTube.

6632
05:02:54,050 --> 05:02:55,210
I'm mostly streaming over there.

6633
05:02:55,670 --> 05:02:55,830
Uh...

6634
05:02:55,830 --> 05:02:56,710
Today was a special day.

6635
05:02:56,910 --> 05:02:59,010
I was just feeling more into...

6636
05:02:59,010 --> 05:03:00,310
I was feeling more into...

6637
05:03:01,030 --> 05:03:02,310
You know, streaming with some more rivals.

6638
05:03:02,810 --> 05:03:05,050
Got really into it for some fucking reason.

6639
05:03:05,270 --> 05:03:06,810
It just, like, bit me in my head.

6640
05:03:07,370 --> 05:03:07,570
Uh...

6641
05:03:07,570 --> 05:03:08,390
Sorry, it's...

6642
05:03:08,390 --> 05:03:08,750
Um...

6643
05:03:11,410 --> 05:03:11,890
Um...

6644
05:03:11,890 --> 05:03:14,110
How do I phrase this lightly?

6645
05:03:16,170 --> 05:03:19,490
Sorry, I'm clinically addicted to...

6646
05:03:20,770 --> 05:03:21,210
To...

6647
05:03:21,210 --> 05:03:22,090
Rank sometimes.

6648
05:03:22,450 --> 05:03:23,570
And, like...

6649
05:03:23,570 --> 05:03:23,990
Um...

6650
05:03:23,990 --> 05:03:25,750
And I relapsed a little bit.

6651
05:03:25,910 --> 05:03:26,450
But don't worry.

6652
05:03:26,650 --> 05:03:27,430
I'm fine.

6653
05:03:27,750 --> 05:03:28,190
I...

6654
05:03:28,190 --> 05:03:29,730
I got out of my system.

6655
05:03:29,810 --> 05:03:31,330
And I should be okay now.

6656
05:03:31,990 --> 05:03:32,430
Uh...

6657
05:03:32,430 --> 05:03:32,930
But, yes.

6658
05:03:33,410 --> 05:03:33,790

Um...

6662
05:03:40,650 --> 05:03:41,430
What else do I wanna say?

6663
05:03:42,830 --> 05:03:43,350
Okay.

6664
05:03:43,350 --> 05:03:43,710

Everything.

And, yeah.

6676
05:04:00,570 --> 05:04:01,010
Uh...

6677
05:04:01,010 --> 05:04:02,150
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

6678
05:04:02,450 --> 05:04:03,370
As always, stay hydrated.

6679
05:04:03,510 --> 05:04:03,890
Posture check.

6680
05:04:04,150 --> 05:04:05,630
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

6681
05:04:05,970 --> 05:04:06,510
Is it up for me?

6682
05:04:06,750 --> 05:04:07,250
Head to bed.

6683
05:04:07,370 --> 05:04:07,770
Cuz...

6684
05:04:07,770 --> 05:04:08,390
You deserve it.

6685
05:04:08,570 --> 05:04:09,710
I'm not gonna raid anyone today.

6686
05:04:10,310 --> 05:04:10,710
Just...

6687
05:04:10,710 --> 05:04:13,090
Go disperse to wherever you wanna go to.

6688
05:04:15,250 --> 05:04:15,650
Um...

6689
05:04:15,650 --> 05:04:17,230
Wherever the land...

6690
05:04:17,230 --> 05:04:17,590
Whatever...

6691
05:04:17,590 --> 05:04:19,610
Wherever the land wants you to go to.

6692
05:04:19,810 --> 05:04:20,930
Oh wait, is Rixi streaming?

6693
05:04:21,170 --> 05:04:21,790
Yeah, I'll just...

6694
05:04:21,790 --> 05:04:22,210
You know what?

6695
05:04:22,210 --> 05:04:22,570
I'll...

6696
05:04:22,570 --> 05:04:23,610
I'll raid Rixi.

6697
05:04:24,290 --> 05:04:24,690
He...

6698
05:04:24,690 --> 05:04:25,550
He...

6699
05:04:25,550 --> 05:04:26,590
You know what?

6700
05:04:26,770 --> 05:04:27,230
Fuck it.

6701
05:04:27,290 --> 05:04:27,770
I'll raid.

6702
05:04:27,910 --> 05:04:28,490
I'll raid him.

6703
05:04:28,690 --> 05:04:30,150
He's the guy I dueled with.

6704
05:04:30,730 --> 05:04:31,210
Uh...

6705
05:04:31,210 --> 05:04:32,850
The EU guy I dueled with.

6706
05:04:33,010 --> 05:04:33,450
Where...

6707
05:04:33,990 --> 05:04:34,470
People...

6708
05:04:34,470 --> 05:04:36,070
Where that one guy was like...

6709
05:04:36,070 --> 05:04:38,070
Fuck you, Rixi in particular.

6710
05:04:38,790 --> 05:04:40,310
Okay, that was pretty silly.

6711
05:04:40,550 --> 05:04:41,690
When he was like...

6712
05:04:42,530 --> 05:04:43,010
Um...

6713
05:04:43,010 --> 05:04:44,430
I thought that was funny.

6714
05:04:44,430 --> 05:04:44,990
When he was like...

6715
05:04:44,990 --> 05:04:46,130
I hate my team.

6716
05:04:46,290 --> 05:04:49,150
But I especially hate Rixi on the enemy team.

6717
05:04:49,370 --> 05:04:50,650
And I'm just thinking like...

6718
05:04:50,650 --> 05:04:51,850
What the fuck did he do?

6719
05:04:54,410 --> 05:04:55,370
I was like...

6720
05:04:55,370 --> 05:04:55,670
I was like...

6721
05:04:55,670 --> 05:04:57,630
Why in particular him?

6722
05:04:59,370 --> 05:04:59,890
Like...

6723
05:04:59,890 --> 05:05:01,170
Then Rixi's like...

6724
05:05:01,170 --> 05:05:02,490
I don't even know this guy.

6725
05:05:05,090 --> 05:05:05,610
Uh...

6726
05:05:05,610 --> 05:05:06,450
But I'll raid him.

6727
05:05:08,150 --> 05:05:08,670
Anyway...

6728
05:05:08,670 --> 05:05:09,650
I'll see you guys next time everybody!

6729
05:05:09,910 --> 05:05:10,390
Bye guys!

6730
05:05:10,650 --> 05:05:10,990
Bye!
