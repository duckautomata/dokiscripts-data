1
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,880
Hey, hey.

2
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,080
You threw me off the groove.

3
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,480
I was like, you're not supposed to talk back.

4
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:47,960
I'm here too!

5
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:58,300
Oh guys, okay, so you guys might see like this little... sorry, I looped the intro because Min and I were sharing secrets.

6
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,440
You're not invited.

7
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,880
They're really good.

8
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Yeah, if only you could have heard what we said.

9
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,300
Oh, you'll never know.

10
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,740
You're gonna miss the FOMO.

11
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,900
Wait, no one said they want the FOMO.

12
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,680
They have the FOMO.

13
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,900
You have FOMO!

14
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,220
Oh, you have FOMO!

15
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,640
What could we have said?

16
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,420
Oh my god, within like five minutes.

17
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,920
I'm gonna tell them right now.

18
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,260
Okay, so you're gonna tell them right now.

19
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:32,640
Yeah, say it.

20
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,360
Because it's about you, so it's your secret.

21
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:39,880
What?

22
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,460
You told me stuff too!

23
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,740
But the later half was your secret.

24
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,420
Oh yeah, first half was Doki's secret.

25
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,260
It was my secret.

27
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,420
Yeah, so there's two secrets that you don't know.

28
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,710
Two whole secrets.

29
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:03,530
Oh my god, two whole secrets that you were not...

30
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:04,410
You were not there for!

31
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,750
How long are we gonna drag this?

32
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,250
We gotta give them all the FOMO.

33
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,190
Yes.

34
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:18,990
Now that we're in these, we don't have to deal with FOMO anymore.

35
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,930
So we give you FOMO instead.

36
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:24,230
We give you FOMO.

37
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:24,910
Yeah.

38
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:27,130
We can do whatever we want.

39
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:27,730
Yeah.

40
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:28,550
Yeah.

41
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:29,130
Yeah.

42
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:29,770
Yeah.

43
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:40,650
Okay, so if you guys don't see the bottom right text on my end, I don't know if you're showing it, Mint, but it says, Oh, I can move myself.

44
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,970
Warning, this version may cause the game to crash.

45
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,670
So it's not our PC.

46
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,650
It might be a Kuso game.

47
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:51,810
Yeah, it might be.

48
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,770
It might be a Kuso game.

49
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,150
This is your decision.

50
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,850
Yeah, I suggested the game.

51
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:08,270
Okay, so this game, I told Mint that she has to start a new game herself as well.

52
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:08,530
Oh, yeah, yeah.

53
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:11,770
So like, cause I, cause there's an intro to the game.

54
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,710
So don't click multiplayer, right?

55
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:15,130
Yeah, don't click, just do new game.

56
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:18,630
And then you do normal and then you'll be met with like an intro.

57
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:25,530
Anyway, so those who don't know what Hospital 666 is, it's basically like that, was it Platform 8?

58
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:26,890
The one with the subway?

59
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:27,250
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

60
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,890
So it's basically Platform 8.

61
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:29,170
Actually?

62
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:30,110
Yeah.

63
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:30,930
But, or Exit 8.

64
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:31,770
Sorry, Exit 8.

65
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:36,730
It's basically Exit 8, but what if we added multiplayer in there?

66
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:37,470
Woohoo!

67
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,350
How do you even do that?

68
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,010
I don't even know.

69
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:41,030
We're gonna find out now.

70
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,430
I wonder if it's like 666 floors.

71
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,970
There's 666 anomalies.

72
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:48,990
How long is this?

73
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:49,630
How long?

74
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:53,570
We're gonna be playing up until Doki's new model.

75
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:54,650
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

76
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,270
New skin suit.

77
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,330
Until the new skin suit.

78
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:57,730
Yeah, yeah.

79
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,690
This is 24 hours by the way.

80
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,470
You know, it was like the...

81
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:02,950
Surprise!

82
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:03,510
Surprise!

83
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:06,890
You know like the Spookies, like jump scare mansion?

84
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,210
Like...

85
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,050
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

86
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:09,290
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

87
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:13,070
We're gonna make it to floor 1000, guys!

88
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:13,890
Jeez!

89
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:15,030
Woo!

90
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,930
Is that actually how long that game is?

91
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:17,350
No way.

92
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:18,050
Oh, yeah.

93
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:18,610
The Spookies.

94
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,170
You ever played the jump scare one?

95
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:21,190
No, no.

96
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:21,730
Oh, yeah.

97
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,230
I think it is.

98
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,290
I think it's like...

99
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:24,570
I think it is.

100
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:25,490
I played it before.

101
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,190
It's up to like 1000 floors.

102
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:28,350
What the hell?

103
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:29,450
Cause like every...

104
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:29,730
And then there's like a lot of...

105
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:32,830
Cause every 100 you get, it's like a new...

106
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,950
Like a new theme to the...

107
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,630
To the like rooms and stuff.

108
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,190
So it gets spookier and spookier.

109
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:39,750
Okay, okay.

110
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,710
And at one point, one of them was like...

111
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:46,170
At one point you go to a floor that's just a fucking maze.

112
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:49,850
It's more than 1000 floors plus bonus DLC floors.

113
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:52,510
They made more floors!

114
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:52,690
More floors!

115
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:53,410
No, it's...

116
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:53,890
Oh, wait.

117
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,190
Yeah, they made more floors.

118
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:56,990
Yeah, there's DLC floors too.

119
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,210
And there's like...

120
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:58,830
And then like...

121
00:07:58,830 --> 00:07:59,710
And then you get taken to the...

122
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,490
You get taken to like a hospital too.

123
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:03,210
It's like Spooky's hospital.

124
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:04,510
Oh, yeah.

125
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:07,170
And then I also...

126
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:12,570
While we were like waiting for the stream, I linked Mint a really good...

127
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:22,730
I linked Mint a YouTuber background and I was like, oh my god, it's perfect.

128
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,420
It's so...

129
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,010
It's the best...

130
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:26,950
It's actually...

131
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,210
I should have used it today.

132
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,690
Honestly, you should have.

133
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:30,830
No, that's what they want.

134
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,610
That's what the Wisp want.

135
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:33,690
Man.

136
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:34,770
That background?

137
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:35,610
Yeah, yeah.

138
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:35,970
Okay.

139
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,650
I'm gonna link it to my chat.

140
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,970
It's this one, guys.

141
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:39,910
We...

142
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:44,030
I'll link it to my chat too.

143
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:49,430
And then you being like, you can recreate that Dr. Horrible thing.

144
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,330
And he can recreate it.

145
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:52,710
Bro!

146
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,290
Everybody loves it.

147
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:57,690
Helping that random girl you see at the laundromat roleplay.

148
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:58,650
It's like...

149
00:08:58,650 --> 00:08:59,490
It's like the...

150
00:08:59,490 --> 00:08:59,670
The...

151
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,990
One of the top five cliches out there.

152
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:03,570
Top five dreams.

153
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:04,470
It's true.

154
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:04,710
It's true.

155
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,630
You could be that girl.

156
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:11,050
Oh my god.

157
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,050
There's this...

158
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:15,510
There's this ghost maid at my laundromat.

159
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,310
My laundromat's haunted.

160
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,470
I'm spooky!

161
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:19,230
Spooky!

162
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,110
Oh my god.

163
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:26,150
Because Mint was like, who wants this?

164
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,750
I was like, what do you mean who wants this?

165
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:28,410
No, no, no.

166
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:31,410
I said what What led to them creating this?

167
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:32,250
Who said man?

168
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,350
Who said man?

169
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,150
I really need like a laundromat.

170
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:41,570
He saw a random girl at the laundromat and he's like, well that could be if only VTubers had this too.

171
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:46,690
Not enough anime start with a guy meeting a girl at the laundromat.

172
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:47,710
I'm telling you.

173
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:51,810
He's like, you know like the West version of weeaboos?

174
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:53,510
The Westaboo?

175
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,710
Yeah, the Westaboos!

176
00:09:54,710 --> 00:10:01,010
I bet you the person who created it is a Westaboo because they saw too many like American TV shows where it starts off with the laundromat.

177
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,390
He's a Westaboo!

178
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,710
He wishes Japan has more of this.

179
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:10,110
I'm gonna throw chat in the laundry machine.

180
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,470
I'm gonna throw you guys in.

181
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:15,730
The perfect RP.

182
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:23,790
I would make it so that the chat is like, the laundromat is like overlaid on top of chat and then you're just spinning it.

183
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:23,910
Yeah.

184
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:24,210
Spinning it.

185
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,310
That's too much work for me.

186
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,510
I won't be doing that.

187
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:30,330
Okay, I'll do it guys.

188
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:31,290
Yeah, yeah.

189
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:36,150
Check Minthe channels out if you want to live your laundromat fantasies.

190
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:36,950
Wow.

191
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,850
See, that's why I linked you the background.

192
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,130
I knew you'd do that.

193
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,970
You knew it was made for me?

194
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,310
I knew it was made for you.

195
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,210
This background's made for you.

196
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:49,530
Okay, guys.

197
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,050
How's our volume by the way?

198
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,070
After all that.

199
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:52,870
Yeah.

200
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:53,310
Do I sound...

201
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,050
We're gonna start a new game.

202
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:54,490
Yeah.

203
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:54,690
We're gonna start a new game.

204
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:55,590
I'm gonna start a new game too.

205
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:56,590
You guys gotta see the intro.

206
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,930
Do I just do any difficulty?

207
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:02,210
Yeah, any difficulty and then we'll... or do normal.

208
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:02,670
Yeah.

209
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:03,490
Actually.

210
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:04,150
Hell is hell.

211
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:04,970
Yeah.

212
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:05,730
Okay.

213
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:06,730
Are you serious?

214
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:07,410
I'm starting the game.

215
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,570
Go some balls.

216
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:09,590
What is this?

217
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:10,270
Go some balls?

218
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:11,030
Yeah.

219
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:14,150
Wait, is this... this is not game footage.

220
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,110
This is a real footage.

221
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:15,910
Yeah, this is the dev.

222
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:16,650
Oh.

223
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,550
What's going on?

224
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,610
Go some balls.

225
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:22,290
Oh my god.

226
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:22,950
Just so mad.

227
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,670
And now we're in the game.

228
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:26,110
What?

229
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:26,670
What?

230
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:27,570
What?

231
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:29,350
What?

232
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,390
That's what I needed.

233
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:31,010
That was it?

234
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:31,670
Yeah, that was it.

235
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:33,150
That's what I wanted you to see.

236
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:35,590
I was like, what the fuck is this?

237
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:40,870
Now you're in the game too.

238
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:42,790
All these instructions.

239
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,830
They have like the entire world.

240
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,010
Wait, is he a Vtuber?

241
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,270
Yeah, yeah.

242
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,670
He's apparently like...

243
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,190
Guys, by the way guys.

244
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:53,870
This developer is single.

245
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:54,650
Can you make me lag?

246
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,190
I'm sorry.

247
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:02,170
So, ladies and guys too.

248
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,330
Wait, should I say turn vsync on or off?

249
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:06,710
I can't remember.

250
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:07,430
Well, I don't know.

251
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:12,950
She asked me if she should play on DX11 or Go and she was like, what's the difference?

252
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:13,810
I was like, I don't know.

253
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:20,630
Turning it on helped me not lag.

254
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:21,790
Okay, that's good.

255
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,190
I'm returning to the menu.

256
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:23,710
All right.

257
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:27,110
Also, sound guy, turn up mint up a bit more.

258
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:27,830
Is it better now?

259
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,170
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

260
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:30,930
Blah, blah, blah.

261
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,030
All right, let me...

262
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:32,650
I'll invite you.

263
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:35,870
Let me go to multiplayer host because I don't know...

264
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:36,990
Did you start off on easy?

265
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:38,670
No, I did normal.

266
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:39,210
Okay.

267
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:41,710
I couldn't tell it because you're like, oops.

268
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,870
And I was like, oh no, what do you mean?

269
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:46,290
Oops.

270
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:47,390
All right.

271
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,050
How do I invite you?

272
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:53,690
All right, give me a second.

273
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:53,970
I'm sick.

274
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:56,570
The friends list is like empty for me.

275
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:57,850
Oh, okay.

276
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:00,790
So this is fine.

277
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,610
That should be fine, right?

278
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:03,510
All right.

279
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,530
I can invite you to watch this game.

280
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:09,190
Wait, can you go to multiplayer and see if you find me in the game?

281
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:11,490
No, you're not there.

282
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,330
I'm not there.

283
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:13,230
Okay, let me...

284
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:13,930
I have no friends.

285
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:14,570
I have no friends.

286
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:15,110
Oh, okay.

287
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:18,370
No, I meant like, you know how you go to multiplayer?

288
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,550
Do I show up on multiplayer?

289
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:21,130
No.

290
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:22,390
I don't?

291
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:23,210
Okay.

292
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:23,930
This is awkward.

293
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:24,890
What if I press host?

294
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,650
Well, if you're hosting, then I can join you.

295
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:28,330
Yeah, try me.

296
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:28,710
Try me.

297
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:29,130
Okay.

298
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:29,930
Give me a second.

299
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:30,670
All right.

300
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:31,850
Return to menu.

301
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:33,390
Refresh.

302
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:34,470
Refresh.

303
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,430
Why don't you exist on my friends list?

304
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,290
That's what I'm saying.

305
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:39,770
Wait, can you invite me?

306
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,550
You guys, we're not professionals.

307
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,110
Like, we're not...

308
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:48,650
We're Indies.

309
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:49,350
We're Indies.

310
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:52,450
You have to have zero expectations on us.

311
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:52,930
Yeah.

312
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,710
We're Indie VTubers.

313
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:55,810
We're Indie VTubers.

314
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:56,350
We're Indie VTubers.

315
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:56,930
Please understand.

316
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:59,750
Please understand.

317
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:02,490
It is just us right now.

318
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:03,210
Yeah.

319
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,490
We're not professionals.

320
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:05,350
We're not...

321
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:10,130
We should not be put up to standards when it comes to corporate VTubers.

322
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,130
We're just one person.

323
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:15,170
I say when I have a team behind me.

324
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,410
Well, I don't.

325
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:18,670
So I can actually...

326
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,030
Yeah.

327
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:19,230
Yeah.

328
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:19,590
Yeah.

329
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,610
Myself and I.

330
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:22,350
Yeah.

331
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:22,730
I am.

332
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:23,150
Friends.

333
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:23,730
Okay.

334
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,470
We're not even...

335
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:24,670
Okay.

336
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,130
Here you go.

337
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,670
I can invite to watch.

338
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:27,870
What?

339
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,270
I can watch you.

340
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,130
I'm sorry.

341
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:34,850
I boosted her volume again.

342
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:35,490
Sound guy.

343
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:37,550
How do I join you?

344
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:38,910
All right.

345
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:39,450
Uh-oh.

346
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:40,070
Uh-oh.

347
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:41,110
Guys, we're...

348
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:42,690
Give us a sec, guys.

349
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,590
We totally...

350
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:44,710
Instead of...

351
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:47,530
You know, we met up 15 minutes before the stream started.

352
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,890
And instead of preparing the stream, we were sharing secrets.

353
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:50,310
Okay?

354
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:51,550
We were sharing secrets.

355
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:51,970
We were sharing secrets.

356
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:52,290
We were sharing secrets.

357
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:52,310
We were sharing secrets.

358
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:52,330
We were sharing secrets.

359
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,960
We had our priorities.

360
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,640
It was a juicy, good secret.

361
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,060
Yeah.

362
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:01,320
Yeah.

363
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,700
If you knew the secret, you would have been like good choice.

364
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,440
You know?

365
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,120
Okay.

366
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,540
I'm gonna do friends.

367
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,840
I'm gonna change my profile settings and see if you can invite me now.

368
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:14,680
Okay.

369
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,580
Do you see me on...

370
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:19,540
I think you see me on VTube studios instead of hospital.

371
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,200
Can you...

372
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:22,660
Oh, wait.

373
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,700
I'm gonna return to the mic.

374
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:23,880
There's a thing from it on the menu.

375
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:24,640
Yeah.

376
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,780
I'm gonna do...

377
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:27,880
Multiplayer.

378
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,560
I'll host.

379
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,680
I'm gonna host a game.

380
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,760
I don't think if you host it you'll show up.

381
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:35,240
Right?

382
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:36,720
That's...

383
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,720
Uh...

384
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,640
No, it should be because...

385
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,800
What's the point of hosting it if you don't...

386
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,900
What's the point of hosting it?

387
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,740
How do the other people...

388
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:48,740
There's no way other VTubers were able to set this up.

389
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:48,920
That's true!

390
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:52,420
We can't be stupider than any other VTuber.

391
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,380
Like...

392
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,000
Yes we can Dokie!

393
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:55,620
Yes we can!

394
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,520
No we can't!

395
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,700
All Vtubers share one brain cell!

396
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,180
There's no way!

397
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:06,900
All Vtubers have like almost equivalent IQ.

398
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,240
Wait, how do you invite someone on Steam?

399
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,920
Wait, what?

400
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,800
That's what I was telling you to do!

401
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:18,760
Control...

402
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,540
No, I do that!

403
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,300
Shift tab!

404
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,520
What do you mean?

405
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,180
Shift tab...

406
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,580
Nothing showed up!

407
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,220
What do you mean?

408
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,660
Oh, just kidding, just kidding.

409
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,280
Have you never done shift tab before?

410
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,760
What do you mean never?

411
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,480
Okay...

412
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,600
Now how do I add you?

413
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,640
Alright, you see where Dokie Bird is...

414
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,860
and then you go to invite...

415
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,260
Oh, I can invite you to watch.

416
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,500
Yes, I know what I'm saying!

417
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,920
I'm saying you can invite me to watch!

418
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,540
But it's not even watch the game, it's watch me, Richard!

419
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,940
I mean, don't you wanna watch my face go up the whole time?

420
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,200
The whole time, definitely!

421
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,880
We both have like a solo session of Hospital 666, and we're just watching.

422
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,420
We sync up our Hospital 666 gameplay together.

423
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:24,740
Obviously.

424
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,620
Or like see who gets to the most floors.

425
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,340
We can make it a competition.

426
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:30,080
Oooh!

427
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,040
Oooh!

428
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,060
I'm gonna restart my game.

429
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,340
Maybe it's not us.

430
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,900
Guys, maybe it's not us.

431
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,280
We need to play in DX mode!

432
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,780
Oh, was it?

433
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,780
Did we actually have to play in DX mode?

434
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:44,940
I don't know.

435
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,400
Okay, you're just making shit up.

436
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,860
Oh, I got an achievement for...

437
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,980
for leaving the game.

438
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,220
Oh, okay!

439
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:51,480
Alright.

440
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,460
Okay, guys.

441
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,040
We're guys.

442
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,880
We can do this, guys.

443
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,060
We can have chat!

444
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,940
No, it's good chat!

445
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,620
You guys get more content!

446
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,200
We could have ended earlier if we didn't have this.

447
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,580
I'm ending the stream right now.

448
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,860
Okay, I'm hosting again.

449
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,520
I'm hosting...

450
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:09,700
Okay, hold on.

451
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,660
Wait, are you on DX11?

452
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,680
I'm on DX11, yeah.

453
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,800
Okay, I'm on the normal one, so I don't know if that affects anything.

454
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:16,640
Oh.

455
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,920
Okay, can you see mine?

456
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:18,880
I see you!

457
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,420
I see you!

458
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:19,680
I see you!

459
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:19,960
Oh my god!

460
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,680
It's DX11!

461
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,440
All of this lying!

462
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,160
Alright.

463
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:23,560
I'm joining.

464
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,520
Are you joining?

465
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,780
Hopefully it doesn't crash because it said that this version...

466
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,380
I'm in the floor.

467
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,200
You're on the floor?

468
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,040
I don't see you.

469
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,720
No, I'm in the floor.

470
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,400
Wait, you're in the floor?

471
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,100
Where are you?

472
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,180
I hear noises.

473
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:35,420
Where are you?

474
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:35,960
I hear you.

475
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,260
It's me walking on top of you.

476
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,440
I think I hear you.

477
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,880
I'm walking up.

478
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,460
Wait, go towards the man with the hat.

479
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,160
Can I see you?

480
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:42,860
Go towards the man with the hat.

481
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,300
Okay, okay.

482
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:43,840
Do you see me?

483
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,340
Do you see me?

484
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,740
Yes, you see me!

485
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,700
I'm stuck in the floor.

486
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,920
I'm gonna leave you.

487
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,160
I'm gonna go to the next floor.

488
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:52,480
Go to the next floor.

489
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,440
Yeah, go to the next floor.

490
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,280
Wait, wait, wait.

491
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,860
Remember I said layout.

492
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,060
This is what it looks like.

493
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,560
This is what the non- This is what the...

494
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,180
Figure it out.

495
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,100
This is okay.

496
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,000
This is a default.

497
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,160
Just figure it out then.

498
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,060
Figure it out.

499
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,100
Okay, okay.

500
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,400
Alright, I'm gonna...

501
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:06,960
I'll leave you.

502
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:07,320
Goodbye.

503
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:08,300
Goodbye.

504
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:08,920
Goodbye.

505
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,760
I see the doors close.

506
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:11,840
Uh oh.

507
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,760
Where are you?

508
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,160
Where did you go?

509
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:15,320
I don't know.

510
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,460
I'm still stuck in the floor.

511
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,320
Where did you go?

512
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,440
Are you on the next floor?

513
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,720
I'm on the next floor.

514
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:25,400
Did you go back?

515
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:29,980
I'm going up another floor and see if- I'm gonna go.

516
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,120
I'm gonna go back up another floor.

517
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,120
Are you still on the first floor?

518
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,600
I can't even exit to the menu.

519
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,560
Like, pressing escape does nothing.

520
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,100
I'm still on the second floor.

521
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,320
Okay, I'm done.

522
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,220
I'm leaving the game?

523
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:46,760
Okay.

524
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,940
I'm gonna start a new game.

525
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,360
Okay.

526
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,280
I'll join you.

527
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,120
I'll join you.

528
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:56,820
Maybe that'll work.

529
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:57,940
Okay, okay.

530
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,180
I'm not doing the DX.

531
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,740
I'm joining normal.

532
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:01,860
I'm hosting.

533
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:03,680
Okay.

534
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,480
Sound guy, I turned down mint a little bit.

535
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,080
Is it better now?

536
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:12,120
We're still adjusting sound while figuring out how to play this game.

537
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,000
It's okay.

538
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,900
It's okay.

539
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,400
We're in these guys.

540
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,920
We're in these guys.

541
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,480
We're in these guys.

542
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,000
We're in these guys.

543
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:22,780
Okay.

544
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,440
Can you see me in the game?

545
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:24,980
Okay.

546
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:25,540
No.

547
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,820
I don't see you in the game.

548
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,060
No.

549
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,140
I do not.

550
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,640
How did you see me?

551
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,920
Maybe it was the DX mode.

552
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:34,480
I'm telling you, man.

553
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,260
I'll go on DX mode.

554
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:36,940
We'll swap.

555
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:41,680
We'll just try hosting again.

556
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,520
Okay, wait.

557
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:42,860
No.

558
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,920
I'll do DX mode.

559
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,540
This is so great, you guys.

560
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,260
Guys, guys, we are professionals here.

561
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:52,200
This is all because we didn't even test it because she was like, you have to see the new game intro.

562
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,560
That's not true.

563
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,520
We didn't test it because I showed her the laundromat.

564
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,360
Get it...

565
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,560
Get it right.

566
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,040
Sorry, my bad.

567
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:06,460
You're right.

568
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,840
There's a sequence of events that led to this.

569
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,480
Yeah, yeah.

570
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,180
Are you in the game yet?

571
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,160
I'm in the game, yeah.

572
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,260
Okay, because I don't see you.

573
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,460
Maybe it's because you're...

574
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,820
Oh, wait.

575
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,540
Hold on, hold on.

576
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:19,960
I'm hosting.

577
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,060
Oh, okay.

578
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:21,600
Okay.

579
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,140
Okay, I also have another idea.

580
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,940
I think it's because your Steam is on...

581
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:27,460
You don't show what game you're playing on Steam.

582
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,160
Because I've made mine friends only.

583
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,500
So you should make yours friends only.

584
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,380
And then after the stream, we private it.

585
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,260
How do you do that?

586
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,300
What do you mean?

587
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,600
That's... Okay.

588
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,420
You go...

589
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,260
Yo.

590
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,740
What did you learn in the last two... three years?

591
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:50,600
Everyone did everything for me.

592
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,360
What did you learn in the last three years?

593
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,100
What did you learn in the last three years?

594
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,140
Okay.

595
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:57,960
Okay.

596
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:01,080
Go to Steam.

597
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,300
Click your name.

598
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,360
Click your name.

599
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,620
Go to privacy settings.

600
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:09,580
Go to privacy settings.

601
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:09,940
Oh, hold on.

602
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,580
Where is...

603
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,180
Wait.

604
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,560
Under my profile?

605
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:15,320
Okay.

606
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,260
You go to... Yeah.

607
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:16,760
Go to...

608
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:17,960
Go to...

609
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,700
Go to edit profile.

610
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,340
Okay.

611
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,120
Oh, privacy settings.

612
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,900
And then friends only.

613
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,560
Oh, my God.

614
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,140
Mint's playing Hospital 666.

615
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:37,480
Oh, my God.

616
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,020
No way.

617
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:38,960
That actually fixed it?

618
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:39,200
No way.

619
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,220
Oh, my God.

620
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,600
I can see you now.

621
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,640
Oh, my God.

622
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,080
Oh, my God.

623
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:43,820
I'm joining.

624
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,120
Oh, there you are.

625
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:46,900
There I am.

626
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:47,840
Oh, my God.

627
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,420
It was the Steam thing all over again.

628
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,580
I can't believe you learned this as an indie.

629
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,460
I'm just getting my feet off the ground.

630
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,600
I've been around for two months.

631
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,300
Come on.

632
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,080
Give me a break.

633
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:04,840
You.

634
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:05,660
You.

635
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,320
You.

636
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:10,980
You.

637
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,600
You guys.

638
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,600
You existed five years ago.

639
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,100
You can't say that.

640
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:27,100
When I existed, you existed when we were both indies, you able to say that.

641
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:27,780
Okay you know what?

642
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,940
Doki you need to shave come on.

643
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:30,220
Ugh.

644
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,560
Come on.

645
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,400
Get out of my way.

646
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,580
Get out of this hospital.

647
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,320
Oh.

648
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:37,960
Oh, my God.

649
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,980
Can we open the door?

650
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:39,700
Okay.

651
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,000
How do you open the door?

652
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,340
I don't think we can.

653
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,420
I don't think we're allowed to.

654
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,600
Okay, we gotta... Oh wait, that's us!

655
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:47,680
That's us!

656
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:48,600
That's our triplet!

657
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,100
We're visiting our triplet at the hospital.

658
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,920
Solid, liquid, solid.

659
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:56,340
Alright.

660
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,860
We gotta memorize this layout.

661
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,280
We gotta figure out what the anomalies are later.

662
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,140
Okay.

663
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,320
Look at that.

664
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,000
I heard that there's like a thing I can do in multiplayer.

665
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,100
Can I do it?

666
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,020
Oh, I can't.

667
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,480
Yes!

668
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,040
Yes!

669
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,620
We're at the hospital, Lina!

670
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,660
I'm at the hospital!

671
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,260
That's where you wanna get beat up, in the hospital.

672
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,540
Don't make me put the putty!

673
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,140
I'm in here!

674
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:22,840
I'm in here too!

675
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,720
We're just spamming the putty.

676
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,600
We're gonna punch you in the balls.

677
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,280
That's what I'm gonna do.

678
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,440
Now I punch you first!

679
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,000
Oh yeah!

680
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,860
Are you gonna make it to the elevator?

681
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:37,620
There's one there!

682
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,360
There's one there!

683
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:38,680
There's one there!

684
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,340
Yeah, push me back to the elevator!

685
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,260
I'm gonna make it before you!

686
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,280
No!

687
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:50,060
Whoa!

688
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,500
Give me!

689
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,100
Wait, wait, wait.

690
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,260
No, I can't!

691
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,920
You can't punch people in the elevator!

692
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:58,580
Yes, you can!

693
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,080
I'm punching you right now.

694
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,720
I like how we are not checking the anomalies.

695
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,500
We're back to floor zero.

696
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,000
Wait, what are you doing?

697
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,120
We were back to floor zero.

698
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:08,620
What happened?

699
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,300
Look at the elevator!

700
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,800
What do you mean what happened?

701
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,840
What do you mean?

702
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,120
We're advancing!

703
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,280
We played the game!

704
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:15,780
Look up!

705
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:17,900
Boop!

706
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:18,420
Boop!

707
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,840
I can't leave you.

708
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,460
I had to do the floor.

709
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,320
Alright.

710
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,480
I don't think there's any anomalies.

711
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,540
Wait, are you getting coffee?

712
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:26,700
Yeah.

713
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,760
Not for you.

714
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,860
Why get coffee when we can get gamer subs?

715
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,460
I saw it.

716
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:38,740
Anyway guys, did you guys know that we both have gamer subs?

717
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,480
We both have gamer subs!

718
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:47,440
Anyway, feel free to use Dokibird for 10% off and only Dokibird.

719
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:53,880
Or Boomer, which is the cooler, more trendy code to use.

720
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,980
Or you can Or the link in the description.

721
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,800
There's no link in your description.

722
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:01,720
Yes there is!

723
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,260
Yes there is!

724
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,360
I'm getting to the elevator first!

725
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,300
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

726
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,860
Oh we were...

727
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,500
Wait you are!

728
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,020
Okay.

729
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,380
Wait a minute, I think there's an anomaly here.

730
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,580
You think so?

731
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,400
Yeah I think so.

732
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,520
What is it?

733
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,680
I don't think there was two cows...psych.

734
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:23,540
You can't even press the button when you can't even go!

735
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,320
No!

736
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,540
I can't ditch you!

737
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,600
What's the point?

738
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,100
What's the point?

739
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,940
We have to find the anomaly.

740
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:34,840
Come on!

741
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,500
I don't know!

742
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,800
Everything looks the same!

743
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,560
Wait, isn't he on the other side?

744
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,300
No he was always here.

745
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,740
No, cause like this is where we started off.

746
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,620
Cause this is where you got coffee remember?

747
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,140
Oh you're right, you're right.

748
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,800
Yeah and then you're like over here and you're like oh there he is.

749
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:51,700
There's all the medicine.

750
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,080
There's this beautiful vista.

751
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,940
Alright let me read the rules.

752
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,360
You find anomaly, press the elevator button.

753
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,120
30 minutes into the stream?

754
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,240
We played this game!

755
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,300
For 5 minutes!

756
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:10,160
20 minutes of this game with text support!

757
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:18,380
If you don't find the anomaly, press the button from the elevator.

758
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,440
Oh from the elevator over on this side.

759
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,580
So if we don't find the anomaly, we just gotta...

760
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,680
Oh we come back here?

761
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:25,520
Yeah, yeah.

762
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:28,400
You can use the top button to review the previous floor.

763
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,020
Orange light outside means you're starting from this elevator.

764
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,540
Oh okay so it tells you which elevator you start from.

765
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:39,580
Wait no if you don't find an anomaly press the button from an... oh so if we find an anomaly we come here.

766
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,480
If we don't find an anomaly we go over there.

767
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,480
It's whatever elevator you start with.

768
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,660
Cause both elevators have the same instruction.

769
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,400
So if we find an anomaly we go up a floor.

770
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,100
I don't think there like... or like...

771
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:55,200
If we find one, we go here.

772
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,900
If we don't find one, we go down there.

773
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:58,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

774
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

775
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,920
No we press the... yeah, yeah.

776
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,080
No it's an E cause there's a restart.

777
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,540
There's a... oh no.

778
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,260
No that's if you wanna go back to the previous floor.

779
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:09,720
Oh!

780
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,260
Guys see we can lean.

781
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,020
Okay do you think there's an anomaly?

782
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:17,900
No I think so.

783
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,500
I think we're good.

784
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,320
Alright so... Okay hold on there's five... six doors.

785
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,840
Two, four, six.

786
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,940
Okay one, two, three, four, five, six.

787
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:27,340
Okay.

788
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,220
That's what I said.

789
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,760
I don't know I'm worried you couldn't count.

790
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,220
You know cause we're VTubers.

791
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,940
They care about our health.

792
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,140
Yeah there's like lots of meds here.

793
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,580
Guys remember to take your meds.

794
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,880
That's all of Doki's meds right there.

795
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,440
Yeah and that...

796
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,920
Yeah, yeah.

797
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,760
Meds is in this room.

798
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,060
It's entire room dedicated to her.

799
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,140
Okay, okay.

800
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,400
This one is so that she can count.

801
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,780
This one is so she can read.

802
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,860
This one is... this one is so...

803
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,500
I can't beat you up anymore.

804
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,080
What happened?

805
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,040
Oh no I need to take my meds.

806
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,440
I've lost control of my arms.

807
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:08,800
This one is so my imaginary friend will finally disappear but I didn't take it.

808
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:09,800
That's why it's all here.

809
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,920
Why can't I punch you?

810
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,320
Alright let's just go up and see what happens.

811
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,960
Cause I didn't take my meds.

812
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,500
Okay we go... we go up.

813
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,920
I think we're... wait what's that?

814
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,120
I think we're good.

815
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,740
Alright we'll see.

816
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:26,380
We're just gonna go to two.

817
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,720
We're gonna go to two?

818
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:29,860
Yeah.

819
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:30,540
It's not moving.

820
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:31,640
Oh!

821
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,780
It's back to zero.

822
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,240
I knew we fucked it up.

823
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,500
There's no... there was...

824
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,520
What did we mess up?

825
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,980
Okay wait so this is zero so we can figure out what...

826
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:45,760
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

827
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,120
Okay so...

828
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,120
Water.

829
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,800
Okay exit side.

830
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,800
The meds are still here.

831
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:55,180
Water.

832
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,360
There's two trash cans.

833
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,020
Did you count it as six doors?

834
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,580
Did you count... yes I counted as six doors.

835
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,060
I just wanted to be sure.

836
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,740
Okay it's cafe cappuccino.

837
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,620
Cafe con...

838
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,960
con... what's it called?

839
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:14,780
Panal.

840
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,700
I think we can go up the floor.

841
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,980
I think this is what... I think this is what pastry zero looks like.

842
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,360
Maybe this side.

843
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:24,780
Yeah maybe this side.

844
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:28,340
One.

845
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:30,580
One.

846
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,820
We can pay attention.

847
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,560
We are VTubers.

848
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,200
There's two of us.

849
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:36,660
Yeah.

850
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,840
This is the amount of like five people.

851
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,400
This is a...

852
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,780
This is a one to four player game.

853
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:46,300
Okay it's not our fault we're missing two players to help us.

854
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,160
Was this always here?

855
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,380
Yeah this was always here.

856
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,260
Okay.

857
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,200
I've seen this before.

858
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:52,380
Okay.

859
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,220
And there was always like two...

860
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:54,660
I don't trust her.

861
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:55,820
Okay.

862
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,340
Alright.

863
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,060
Okay then let's stay on this elevator.

864
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,940
Let's stay over here and press the button.

865
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,160
If you don't trust me.

866
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,600
I mean the guy is...

867
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:04,700
Oh!

868
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,680
Oh my god there's an anomaly!

869
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:07,780
What's the anomaly?

870
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,500
This guy is running!

871
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:10,480
What?

872
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,300
Oh my god!

873
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,380
Are you sure?

874
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,000
Wait what do you mean am I sure?

875
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:16,900
Do you not see it?

876
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,280
No he's standing still.

877
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,540
Wait actually?

878
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:20,980
Yeah.

879
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,360
Are you sure?

880
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,580
Are you gaslighting me?

881
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:30,360
Are you gaslighting me?

882
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,220
I have photographic proof.

883
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:34,560
I'm glad I'm streaming.

884
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,080
I'm glad I'm streaming.

885
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:37,640
A photo means that it's a photo.

886
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,640
It's a snapshot.

887
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,720
A photo isn't animated.

888
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,420
That proves my point.

889
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,720
No chat I took my...

890
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,500
You guys come on believe me.

891
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,640
Come on look at him.

892
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,760
He's running!

893
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,140
It's not running right?

894
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,700
It's not running right?

895
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,400
It is running right?

896
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:58,580
It's not.

897
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,700
I don't see it.

898
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,160
I'm looking at the stream right now.

899
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:02,960
It's not running.

900
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:03,640
Yes!

901
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:03,940
Yes!

902
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,580
Use your eyes!

903
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:11,840
I can only see it five frames per second.

904
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:12,460
I can only see it five frames per second.

905
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:12,620
So...

906
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,300
Wait so then that means we go back to this one right?

907
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,320
Yeah we go back and we like go up.

908
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,040
Yeah.

909
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:21,660
Yeah.

910
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,580
So like you know how like...

911
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:27,040
You know how like some camera, like some video cameras can only see like certain frames?

912
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,380
And then...

913
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:33,420
So like you can actually have like a video of like a bird whose wings are just like...

914
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,040
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

915
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,000
Those are my eyes.

916
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:36,500
Right?

917
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,040
I think you need to get help for that.

918
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:39,600
Oh we're at two!

919
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:40,760
We did it!

920
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:41,400
That was me.

921
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,120
We did it.

922
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,860
We did it.

923
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,020
This is a team game.

924
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,320
It's a collab.

925
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,520
What you accomplish is what I accomplish.

926
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,240
Oh my god and now he's green.

927
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,520
He's not running at all.

928
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:57,760
Alright.

929
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,460
I am looking at the calendar.

930
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:00,600
Medical...

931
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,060
Center first.

932
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,740
Everything looks the same.

933
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,240
Everything looks the same.

934
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:07,040
Yeah.

935
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,280
You know what I think you know who...

936
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:09,540
Wait!

937
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,600
There's three clocks!

938
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,520
There's three clocks!

939
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,480
Oh there's... wait wasn't there always three clocks?

940
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:14,940
There's three clocks!

941
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:14,940
Oh there's...

942
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:14,940
wait wasn't there always three clocks?

943
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,140
I only saw one before.

944
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,000
Maybe that was the other one.

945
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:17,420
That was the anomaly.

946
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,360
Wait.

947
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,220
Maybe... Oh I think it is three clocks is the anomaly.

948
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:21,580
Yeah.

949
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,820
So we go up from here.

950
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:23,080
Yeah.

951
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,460
See we're doing so good!

952
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:25,780
Teamwork!

953
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:26,380
We!

954
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,480
We!

955
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:31,040
We're doing so good guys!

956
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:32,100
Teamwork!

957
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:33,820
I think you know what?

958
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,920
You know who can be our third and fourth player?

959
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:36,400
Who?

960
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:36,860
Chat.

961
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:37,680
Yeah.

962
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,140
Oh true.

963
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:38,800
Chat.

964
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,640
Oh look!

965
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,140
See!

966
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,100
One clock!

967
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:41,740
Yeah!

968
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:42,360
One clock!

969
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:43,560
One clock!

970
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,580
Oh my god.

971
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,940
I think we're really good at this game.

972
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,360
I think this game is too easy.

973
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,440
Yeah this game is weird.

974
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,540
It's not like we fucked up like three times before we figured it out.

975
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,660
The royal we.

976
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:56,620
Yeah sure.

977
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,840
I don't think there's any anomalies this time.

978
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,540
It doesn't look like it.

979
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:03,020
Well you said that last time and there were three clocks!

980
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,580
Look I didn't look behind me!

981
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:05,880
How many doors?

982
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,080
Doki how many doors are there?

983
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:07,360
Six.

984
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,040
One, two, three, four, five, six.

985
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:11,180
See I can count too.

986
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,140
She took her meds everybody.

987
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,340
Yeah I took my meds.

988
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:14,620
You see?

989
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:14,760
See?

990
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,920
Up we go!

991
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,060
Come on!

992
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,880
I can't go up a floor without you!

993
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:30,640
Come on!

994
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,260
I can't go up a floor without you!

995
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:33,460
What are you doing?

996
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:37,980
Okay.

997
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,120
Don't go back to zero.

998
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,400
Wait does it go back to zero?

999
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,620
Yeah it goes back to zero.

1000
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:42,060
We lose.

1001
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,040
I don't even know how many floors it's supposed to be.

1002
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:44,420
I don't know.

1003
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:44,940
Four!

1004
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:45,300
Four!

1005
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:45,840
We're doing it!

1006
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:47,140
Alright.

1007
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,780
Everything looks fine.

1008
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,440
Okay there's two fire... Wait wait!

1009
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,340
The fire hydrants!

1010
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,080
There's always been two.

1011
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,440
Yeah but then look at the labels.

1012
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,700
Weren't they like together?

1013
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,680
Like the same label?

1014
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,140
Oh I don't know.

1015
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,540
But also wait we started on the other side.

1016
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:06,240
Is that normal?

1017
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,580
No we went here.

1018
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,120
We came to this elevator cause there was no anomaly.

1019
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:12,260
So we started on that side.

1020
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,520
Okay okay okay you're right.

1021
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:13,960
Okay.

1022
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,340
Check the meds.

1023
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:17,380
Hmm.

1024
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:22,460
I like how it said fire hydrants and you agreed with me.

1025
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,780
What's... Oh fire hydrants.

1026
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,060
I told you chat!

1027
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:32,660
Oh!

1028
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,140
There's a... There's there's there's there's!

1029
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,020
Oh the water!

1030
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,240
It's leaking.

1031
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,040
Oh my god!

1032
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,860
Wait does somebody... What's going on here?

1033
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:39,900
Wait okay that's...

1034
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,400
Why is there... Why is there water and why is there blood here?

1035
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,200
Why is there blood on the... Yeah!

1036
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,620
And it's old blood too cause it's dark red.

1037
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:47,440
Ooh.

1038
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:50,020
Ooh somebody like stubbed their toe or something.

1039
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:53,180
I think that is a pretty extreme stubbed toe.

1040
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,380
I think...

1041
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,920
So we go in this one right?

1042
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,660
No we go on the other... Don't we go on the other one where there's an anomaly?

1043
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,500
Okay let's read the rules again.

1044
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:03,700
I'm confused!

1045
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,680
I don't remember how we did this.

1046
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,000
I...

1047
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:07,760
Okay.

1048
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,200
Oh my god the VTuber is a piano.

1049
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:09,740
And you find the...

1050
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,780
elevator... Anomaly press the button from the elevator you come from.

1051
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,200
Yeah from the elevator you come from.

1052
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,760
Oh okay okay okay.

1053
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,880
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

1054
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:18,480
See?

1055
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,500
We're doing it.

1056
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,820
I told you this is a team of we.

1057
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:22,820
We got this!

1058
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:23,260
I told...

1059
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,280
We.

1060
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:25,480
We.

1061
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:25,920
We.

1062
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:26,820
Alright.

1063
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:28,600
Nice.

1064
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,040
Nice.

1065
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:29,620
Fifth floor.

1066
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,040
Chat how many floors is this?

1067
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:32,740
We don't know.

1068
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:33,660
We probably don't know.

1069
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,560
They've seen gameplay of this before?

1070
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:39,980
Alright.

1071
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:40,320
Okay.

1072
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,300
Let's see.

1073
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:42,620
Alright.

1074
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,800
Fire extinguisher.

1075
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,000
That looks fine.

1076
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,760
Everything looks fine.

1077
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,000
The medicine looks the same.

1078
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,600
The medicine looks the same.

1079
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:51,180
Oh!

1080
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,920
Did you see that?

1081
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,760
Did you see that?

1082
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,780
What was that shit?

1083
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,660
Get away guys!

1084
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,500
Yeah I think this floor was...

1085
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,440
I think this floor was...

1086
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:04,560
I think this floor was cursed.

1087
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,120
This floor is cursed.

1088
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,280
What did you see?

1089
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,220
Did you see the skeleton?

1090
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,080
The face?

1091
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,160
Did you see the face?

1092
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:14,660
Yeah yeah yeah.

1093
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,840
No I looked at the painting.

1094
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,100
I looked at this painting.

1095
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,340
There was a face in the painting.

1096
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,580
And I looked at it and I was like, Oh what's this?

1097
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,340
Oh it showed up on my whole screen!

1098
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,140
Yeah you're just...

1099
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,720
I told you this is a we team.

1100
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,660
What I do, you get affected.

1101
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,600
Why is this guy just sitting here the whole time?

1102
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:34,940
He's here!

1103
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:35,820
He's like triplet!

1104
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:36,980
He's moral support!

1105
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,220
Well he needs to be a team player.

1106
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:44,880
He's the one that popped out like five minutes later so we don't talk about him.

1107
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:45,340
He's the one that popped out like five minutes later so we don't talk about him.

1108
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,420
I think...

1109
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,740
He was in there a little too long.

1110
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,440
He goes extra cooked in the oven.

1111
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:53,860
He goes extra cooked in the oven.

1112
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:56,440
It's fine he's just the silent archetype.

1113
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,780
Oh we're like the...

1114
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,820
Huey, Dewey and Louie.

1115
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:02,480
Louie?

1116
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,520
We're like the three students.

1117
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,460
I think it's good.

1118
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:10,560
I think so too.

1119
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,000
So we should be at the other side then.

1120
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,440
Of the elevator.

1121
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,020
We should be on this side.

1122
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,480
So there's no anomaly we go to the other side.

1123
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,880
How are you still wondering about the rules?

1124
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:23,980
We're on the seventh...

1125
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,560
I can't remember this!

1126
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,220
We're on the sixth floor!

1127
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,840
I'm just finding anomalies okay?

1128
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,080
Wait no!

1129
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,540
Oh yeah I can find it.

1130
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,380
And you don't.

1131
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,180
There's barely two rules!

1132
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,180
It's too complicated!

1133
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:41,420
It's too complicated!

1134
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,920
What do you mean there's two rules?

1135
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,960
It can't be complicated when there's two rules!

1136
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,840
I thought you had...

1137
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,620
What happened to photographic memory?

1138
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:56,720
I didn't say I had photographic memory!

1139
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,380
I didn't say that even once!

1140
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,740
Wait what did you say?

1141
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,060
You had photographic memory?

1142
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,060
Photographic something!

1143
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,360
I don't remember.

1144
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,140
Well we know you definitely don't have photographic memory.

1145
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,620
No definitely not.

1146
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,540
I don't see any anomaly.

1147
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,340
I don't see anything either.

1148
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,500
Let's see.

1149
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,440
One, two, three, four, five.

1150
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:21,880
Count the doors!

1151
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,060
I counted there's six.

1152
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:26,920
Okay and the fire extinguishers are real.

1153
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,480
They look good.

1154
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,020
Oh wait!

1155
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,060
There's a six on the floor!

1156
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:32,440
What's on this door?

1157
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:33,580
Wait was there a six?

1158
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,420
There's a six on every door.

1159
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,160
Was that always the case?

1160
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,460
I mean I think so.

1161
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,040
I can't remember.

1162
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,040
Wait.

1163
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,920
Chat do your part!

1164
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,680
This is a four player game.

1165
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,500
You're two player three and four.

1166
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,160
What's the point of streaming?

1167
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,760
What's the point of streaming if you don't help out?

1168
00:39:58,980 --> 00:39:59,580
Do your part.

1169
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:01,500
What are you talking about?

1170
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,800
Chat is this real?

1171
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,080
I think it's an anomaly.

1172
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:06,700
Guys is this...

1173
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,080
Has this always been here?

1174
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:08,760
Guys?

1175
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:12,640
Is there anything on the floor?

1176
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:13,860
No help.

1177
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,360
Why do they keep saying that?

1178
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,340
Guys you're...

1179
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:20,900
Our fucking live tag is literally called Bird Seeders.

1180
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,340
As in backseaters.

1181
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:27,240
Where are my goddamn backseaters?

1182
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:29,500
Where's... okay backseaters is...

1183
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,820
There's your time to shine!

1184
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,220
You guys know I'm telling the streamer what to do!

1185
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:34,540
Guys!

1186
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,520
Tell the streamer what to do!

1187
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,180
They said it's an anomaly.

1188
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,480
Wait which one did we come from?

1189
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,020
Which elevator?

1190
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:40,620
No Elf?

1191
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,360
Wait you're right.

1192
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,180
Oh no this one.

1193
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:42,580
This one.

1194
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:42,940
The orange.

1195
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,720
Whatever has the orange...

1196
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,440
Where does it say Elf?

1197
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:49,460
What do you mean whatever has the orange?

1198
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,900
Whatever has the orange is where we came from.

1199
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,140
What orange are you talking about?

1200
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:55,600
This!

1201
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,480
The orange... look up.

1202
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,240
Hahaha!

1203
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:00,880
Do you see the orange lighting?

1204
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,340
Oh like the orange lighting.

1205
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:02,500
Oh my god.

1206
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:03,900
You just say the orange.

1207
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,540
I don't know what you're talking about.

1208
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,300
Literally cause it's orange.

1209
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,980
What do you want me to say?

1210
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,760
I said orange look up.

1211
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:13,120
The orange lighting!

1212
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:15,780
Hahaha!

1213
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,380
Oh I'm sorry.

1214
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:19,260
Maybe you were in the womb too long.

1215
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:20,260
Hahaha!

1216
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,460
Hey I'm not like him.

1217
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,960
And he's a good guy okay?

1218
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,920
How would you know?

1219
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,980
He doesn't even talk to us.

1220
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,580
How do you know that?

1221
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,520
So we come here.

1222
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:33,660
We come here.

1223
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:34,360
I think it's an anomaly.

1224
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:36,580
I don't remember seeing the sixes before.

1225
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,920
I'm pretty sure the sixes have always been here.

1226
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,480
Right?

1227
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:41,620
Chat.

1228
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,500
Chat if you don't help us we're going back to floor zero.

1229
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:45,580
Hahaha!

1230
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:46,400
Do you want that?

1231
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:49,540
Do you want to see us back to floor zero?

1232
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:50,500
Hahaha!

1233
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:51,780
Hahaha!

1234
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:52,660
Hahaha!

1235
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:54,980
The orange.

1236
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,080
What does no help mean?

1237
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:58,780
They said yes.

1238
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,160
It means no help!

1239
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:00,960
Hahaha!

1240
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,040
I don't know.

1241
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:08,220
I'm just thinking maybe there's something in there that says no help.

1242
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,360
Hahaha!

1243
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,560
They're just being stupid.

1244
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:12,520
Hahaha!

1245
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,400
No don't call them stupid.

1246
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,720
That definitely won't help.

1247
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:17,540
Hahaha!

1248
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,300
They like it.

1249
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:19,980
They like it a little bit.

1250
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:21,360
Okay we're taking the risk.

1251
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,060
We're taking the risk.

1252
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:22,640
Okay.

1253
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,740
Alright it's time.

1254
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,040
Oh wait we could have gone to the previous floor.

1255
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:27,800
Oh shit you're right.

1256
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,100
We could have gone to the...

1257
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:30,560
Alright here we go.

1258
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:31,380
Oh!

1259
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,200
We did it!

1260
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,220
Oh!

1261
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:33,620
Oh!

1262
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:34,040
Oh!

1263
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,040
Wait I'm looking though.

1264
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:37,120
Yeah it was an anomaly.

1265
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,020
I dare you to go in.

1266
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:39,780
I dare you to go in.

1267
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:41,600
I dare you.

1268
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,740
Wait there was an anomaly then.

1269
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:44,860
Yeah!

1270
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,900
It was the six on the doors.

1271
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:48,800
The one that I caught.

1272
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:49,660
Oh!

1273
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:53,020
I double dare you to go to there.

1274
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:54,100
No I already dared you first.

1275
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:55,300
I double dare you.

1276
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:55,500
Go!

1277
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:55,940
Go!

1278
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:55,980
Go!

1279
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,620
By the rules I double dare you.

1280
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:57,960
No!

1281
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:59,560
I triple dare you!

1282
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:00,600
I triple dare you!

1283
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:00,680
I triple dare you!

1284
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:01,960
I triple dare you!

1285
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:02,400
Hahaha!

1286
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:05,780
I caught Jinx.

1287
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,540
Alright goodbye.

1288
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:09,960
Goodbye Mint.

1289
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,100
Go up.

1290
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:14,080
Wait I get affected too?

1291
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:14,980
Hahaha!

1292
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,620
You closed the game!

1293
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:28,940
Okay this is...

1294
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,440
This is a team game.

1295
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:33,240
This is a team game.

1296
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,720
Don't ever triple...

1297
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:38,020
Don't dare me to do anything ever again.

1298
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:38,740
Hahaha!

1299
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:41,900
I can't move on from her death.

1300
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:42,740
Hahaha!

1301
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:44,280
Hahaha!

1302
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,040
Hahaha!

1303
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,780
That's not fair Debs!

1304
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,480
Debs that is not fair!

1305
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,000
She can hold us hostage!

1306
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:51,980
Hahaha!

1307
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:53,480
Hahaha!

1308
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:58,220
All F4s out of the game.

1309
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:58,680
Hahaha!

1310
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,480
Okay um...

1311
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,100
Do you wanna host it?

1312
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,000
Wait no!

1313
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:07,300
See if you host it.

1314
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,820
Continue game and see if we go back to the 8th floor.

1315
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:11,660
Continue.

1316
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:13,680
Does it do it?

1317
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:14,940
Oh wait!

1318
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,580
Wait I just pressed continue.

1319
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:17,580
I didn't press host.

1320
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:19,380
Oh I'm on floor 8!

1321
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,740
Yeah I told you!

1322
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:21,800
Come here come here.

1323
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:26,100
Okay let me see how I can...

1324
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:27,300
I'm figuring this out!

1325
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:27,940
Get out.

1326
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:28,900
Get in here.

1327
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:29,280
Get in here.

1328
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:31,800
Watch your game.

1329
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:32,220
Hahaha!

1330
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:35,240
Wait you didn't click host!

1331
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:36,780
Uh...

1332
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:38,320
You're in a single player game!

1333
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,840
You have to go back to the main menu.

1334
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,640
I just pressed continue.

1335
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:42,700
Oh wait.

1336
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:43,720
Oh I see you I see you.

1337
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:44,200
Hold on.

1338
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:45,460
Okay okay I'm in I'm in.

1339
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:48,120
We're at level 8!

1340
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:49,240
Yeah!

1341
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:50,840
Yippie!

1342
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:51,620
Okay no.

1343
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:52,280
Yeah yeah no.

1344
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,160
No we're not doing that again.

1345
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:54,640
Hahaha!

1346
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:00,020
You know you got an achievement where like I think the game crashed.

1347
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:00,860
Like that was the...

1348
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:02,660
That was the achievement.

1349
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:03,540
Yeah yeah.

1350
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:05,640
Nice.

1351
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:06,520
Alright.

1352
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:09,040
Oh yeah there was no sixes!

1353
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:09,780
Yeah!

1354
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:10,440
Alright!

1355
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:11,900
Hello friend.

1356
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:12,780
Alright.

1357
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:13,420
Our brother.

1358
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,680
Our triplet.

1359
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,460
Our Louie.

1360
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,420
Our Louie.

1361
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,940
Louie was the silent one right?

1362
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:24,880
I have no idea.

1363
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:25,340
I don't know.

1364
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:25,900
I don't remember.

1365
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:27,100
Aren't those the ducks?

1366
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,700
Yeah they're the... Yes!

1367
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:30,160
It's the ducks!

1368
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:32,280
But none of them were silent!

1369
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:32,860
Yeah!

1370
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:35,640
No one of them was like the newer ducktales.

1371
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:36,640
The newest ducktales.

1372
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:39,480
One of them was like they made one of them silent.

1373
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:43,100
And then one of them was the Sonic's voice actor.

1374
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:45,200
And the other one was Abed.

1375
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:46,400
Abed yeah.

1376
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:46,860
Yeah yeah.

1377
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:51,720
I think we're good here.

1378
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:53,560
I think so too.

1379
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:54,660
I think there's no anomalies.

1380
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:55,140
I don't...

1381
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:55,840
I don't think so either.

1382
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:57,600
Move.

1383
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:58,880
No you move.

1384
00:45:59,080 --> 00:45:59,760
We're a team!

1385
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:00,980
You move.

1386
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:03,380
WrestleTuber 20... 20... 25!

1387
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:04,320
You move.

1388
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:05,360
You move.

1389
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:07,960
Abed in hospital.

1390
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:10,380
Six WrestleTubers.

1391
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:11,820
The sequel to WrestleTuber.

1392
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,020
We're going to a hospital.

1393
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:15,740
Real.

1394
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:16,880
Real.

1395
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:17,220
Okay.

1396
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:17,800
Okay.

1397
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:18,600
Alright.

1398
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:19,840
Ten floor.

1399
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:21,700
Ten.

1400
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:22,620
Ten.

1401
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:23,520
Ten.

1402
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:23,940
Yeah!

1403
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,080
We're so good at this game.

1404
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:29,340
We're really good at this game.

1405
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:29,720
Yeah.

1406
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:31,980
We can see all the anomalies.

1407
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,740
I thought the doors would open at some point.

1408
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,000
I think that's like you know how there's like a locked part.

1409
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:41,980
I know the doors you can open them but I think you know like when you start a game it's like easy, normal, and locked.

1410
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:45,540
I think the locked portion you can open the doors.

1411
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:47,000
Oh okay okay.

1412
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:48,480
So I was like...

1413
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,220
Our vision is terrible.

1414
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,640
...we have to get all of you close.

1415
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:52,760
What is this?

1416
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:53,480
No, I can see it.

1417
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:54,680
I think it's right.

1418
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:55,800
May, June, July.

1419
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:57,120
That's right.

1420
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:58,620
We care about your health.

1421
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:03,040
Wait, why is it like, if I'm like halfway in between, it gets like really blurry.

1422
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:04,640
I think you need glasses.

1423
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:05,620
I can see it fine.

1424
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:06,900
Are you on low quality?

1425
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:08,140
Probably.

1426
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:10,560
The game defaults to low graphics.

1427
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:13,100
Yeah, because it's making me lag anyway sometimes.

1428
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:14,180
Oh wait, really?

1429
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:18,320
I opened it up this time in DX.

1430
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,240
Maybe it'll help.

1431
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:21,740
Stop it!

1432
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:22,580
Stop it!

1433
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:27,440
She's the violent triplet.

1434
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,400
She's the one that mom had to take to the hospital.

1435
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:34,640
I have anger issues.

1436
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,440
Wait, so do we go in this one?

1437
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,100
Yeah, we go in this one because there's no anomalies.

1438
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:40,020
Okay.

1439
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:40,960
Alright.

1440
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:43,060
Up we go.

1441
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:44,880
Eleven, eleven.

1442
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:45,520
Eleven.

1443
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:48,280
Yeah, it's my soldier genes.

1444
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,760
She has the killing gene in her.

1445
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:58,620
Okay, yeah, I think that was an anomaly.

1446
00:47:58,780 --> 00:47:59,800
I think, I don't know.

1447
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,200
I think we should talk to her.

1448
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:04,320
I can fix her.

1449
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:05,940
I can fix her.

1450
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:08,620
Okay.

1451
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:09,640
One clock.

1452
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:11,120
One clock.

1453
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:12,260
All the coffees.

1454
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:13,280
One brother.

1455
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:13,820
Oh!

1456
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:14,580
Ah!

1457
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:15,520
Ah!

1458
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:16,380
Ah!

1459
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:17,260
Ah!

1460
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,320
Don't turn it on me!

1461
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:24,340
I think something's happening on that floor.

1462
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:25,860
No.

1463
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:27,500
Alright.

1464
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:28,980
We're fine.

1465
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:29,220
See?

1466
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,300
Everything is fine.

1467
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:32,380
I'm not letting you out of here.

1468
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:33,040
Oh!

1469
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:34,400
Look up.

1470
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:35,400
Oh!

1471
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:36,460
Oh!

1472
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:37,980
Yeah.

1473
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,480
We are speed running this game.

1474
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:45,000
I think this is a fire hazard floor with all those fire alarms.

1475
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:46,040
They do.

1476
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:47,040
They're a little paranoid.

1477
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:47,580
Yeah.

1478
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:49,460
Hmm.

1479
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:51,060
Alright.

1480
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:52,120
Alright.

1481
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:52,880
Alright, fine.

1482
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:53,380
This looks normal.

1483
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:54,860
This looks like a normal time.

1484
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:55,840
Yeah.

1485
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:57,640
Everything looks good.

1486
00:48:58,280 --> 00:48:58,780
Okay.

1487
00:48:59,160 --> 00:48:59,660
Alright.

1488
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:00,160
Coffee.

1489
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:00,660
Gold.

1490
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:01,680
So good.

1491
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:02,780
Our brother is still here.

1492
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:03,420
Wait.

1493
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:04,260
There's still...

1494
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:06,580
Have there always been this many fire alarms?

1495
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:07,800
I haven't been looking up.

1496
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:09,180
Gamers don't look up, you guys.

1497
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:09,300
Yeah.

1498
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:10,200
Gamers don't look...

1499
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,060
I think it's...

1500
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:12,360
Wait.

1501
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:12,920
Has there?

1502
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:14,940
I don't think that's...

1503
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:15,580
Now I'm paranoid.

1504
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:16,000
Yeah.

1505
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:16,420
Me too.

1506
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:19,220
After seeing like 200 fire alarms on my phone, I'm like, oh, there's a fire alarm.

1507
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:21,620
I don't know.

1508
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:23,260
Has there always been?

1509
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:25,140
That's a little bit too much, isn't it?

1510
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:25,880
Right.

1511
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:29,340
I feel like a hospital shouldn't have that many.

1512
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:32,120
They wouldn't do two anomalies with this many.

1513
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,000
Like with a bunch of fire alarms, right?

1514
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:38,820
I mean, the fucking dev crashed our game.

1515
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:39,660
So I feel like that's something.

1516
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,080
Wait a minute.

1517
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:42,160
This door is huge.

1518
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:44,680
Oh, you're right.

1519
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:45,680
The doors are huge.

1520
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:46,260
Yeah.

1521
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:47,180
Or we're tiny.

1522
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:48,420
I don't know.

1523
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:49,200
I don't know.

1524
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:49,240
I just don't know.

1525
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:49,340
I don't know.

1526
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:51,500
Like how we passed like five doors...

1527
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:52,260
Every single...

1528
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:53,740
We went to the very end of the hallway.

1529
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:59,340
We went through five doors and we're like, that seems normal.

1530
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,680
We were regressing in our height, in our old age.

1531
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:06,060
We were focused on the fire alarms.

1532
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:07,160
We were focused on the safety.

1533
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:08,540
Oh, wait.

1534
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,160
The door is open.

1535
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:13,940
I triple dare dog, dare you to go through that door.

1536
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:15,680
I did it last time.

1537
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,500
You go.

1538
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:18,500
You go.

1539
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:19,200
How about we do it again?

1540
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,460
We're together as twins!

1541
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:21,080
No, you baby!

1542
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,940
We do this together!

1543
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,480
Why didn't you come with me last time then?

1544
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:27,440
I did!

1545
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:33,320
I was about to get out of that elevator when you went in.

1546
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,620
I was gonna...

1547
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:36,320
It's not my fault you didn't wait.

1548
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:39,200
Go, go, go in the...

1549
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:40,200
Oh!

1550
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:40,840
Go to the other one!

1551
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:41,880
What do you mean?

1552
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:43,300
There's more than one?

1553
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:44,700
Yeah, another door opened.

1554
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:45,360
What do you mean?

1555
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:46,540
Okay, I just did that door.

1556
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:47,080
It's your turn.

1557
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,440
No, no, no!

1558
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:49,520
We swapped!

1559
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,040
We swapped!

1560
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,180
Go, Ducky!

1561
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:59,080
Whatever jump scare comes out, you get it too!

1562
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:00,340
Okay, good.

1563
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,080
Is this some Scooby Doo shit?

1564
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:10,980
Go get the other one.

1565
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,540
Go, go, Ducky!

1566
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,740
No, no, no!

1567
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:17,960
It's your turn!

1568
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:20,040
We did the last door together!

1569
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:21,700
Okay, okay, okay.

1570
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:22,260
Come on, come on.

1571
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:22,860
Okay, alright.

1572
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:26,820
Yeah, that's right.

1573
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:27,560
Oh!

1574
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:29,300
I knew it!

1575
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:30,040
It's the same door!

1576
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:31,180
This door opened before!

1577
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:32,760
It is Scooby Doo!

1578
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:34,020
Oh, it's looping!

1579
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:34,220
It's looping.

1580
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:35,060
I told you!

1581
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:36,280
It's Scooby Doo!

1582
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:39,180
What's new Scooby Doo?

1583
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:45,100
Someone's like, this instigator mint cow... Oh yeah, it is cow...

1584
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:45,760
I read that wrong.

1585
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,060
Yeah, it is cow or doke.

1586
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:48,140
instigator mint.

1587
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:52,840
You were ready to rip that chatter apart.

1588
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:55,440
I was like, what do you mean, coward mint?

1589
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,580
I was like, what do you mean, coward mint?

1590
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:58,000
I was like, what do you mean, coward mint?

1591
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,440
Can we finally have a regular floor?

1592
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,060
Can we finally have a regular floor?

1593
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:05,280
We've had anomalies back to back.

1594
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:07,280
It's not normal.

1595
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:08,540
It's not normal.

1596
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:10,200
He's happy!

1597
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:11,640
He heard some good news!

1598
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:12,300
Solidus!

1599
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:14,940
He's like, gamer subs!

1600
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:16,380
Wow, gamer subs!

1601
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,880
Mint just got partied!

1602
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:19,240
He's laughing!

1603
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:20,480
Oh my god, he's laughing!

1604
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:22,080
Where he is?

1605
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:22,860
Is this a dev?

1606
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:26,740
Is this a dev's laugh?

1607
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:29,720
Oh my god, is he getting louder?

1608
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:31,460
Maybe that's why he's single.

1609
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,600
Did we win?

1610
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:37,480
What's going on?

1611
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:37,980
What's going on?

1612
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:40,220
What the fuck was that?

1613
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:42,220
It was the SCP!

1614
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:45,460
What the fuck was that?

1615
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:46,080
What was that?

1616
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:47,020
What is that?

1617
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:49,900
It's the SCP!

1618
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:51,820
You put it in the elevator!

1619
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:55,440
Why is he chasing me?

1620
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:58,240
Oh no!

1621
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:00,640
We gotta get to the elevator!

1622
00:53:08,490 --> 00:53:10,590
Why are you relying on me?

1623
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:15,170
Oh my god, he's really coming after you.

1624
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:16,330
Wait, I can't get past.

1625
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:16,930
He's blocking me.

1626
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:17,450
He's blocking the way!

1627
00:53:18,330 --> 00:53:19,470
He's blocking the way!

1628
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:20,170
It took too long!

1629
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:21,530
I'm trying to figure this out!

1630
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:23,390
What if he turns around?

1631
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:25,190
What if he turns around?

1632
00:53:25,270 --> 00:53:26,970
Oh, he is not turning around.

1633
00:53:27,130 --> 00:53:29,450
He's not turning around.

1634
00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:32,590
You need to be in the elevator!

1635
00:53:33,930 --> 00:53:36,270
Oh, we escaped from the statue.

1636
00:53:36,730 --> 00:53:37,130
Oh, we escaped from the statue.

1637
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:39,130
We escaped from floor 66.

1638
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:40,570
That was 66.

1639
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:41,470
We're at 100!

1640
00:53:43,450 --> 00:53:45,150
How did we get to 100?

1641
00:53:45,550 --> 00:53:46,230
I don't know.

1642
00:53:46,950 --> 00:53:48,190
Oh, wait, that's the door again!

1643
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:48,830
It's the door again!

1644
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:51,070
Is that...

1645
00:53:51,070 --> 00:53:51,230
No!

1646
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:55,530
I think this is because we've advanced now.

1647
00:53:55,550 --> 00:53:56,510
Oh, it's like a new...

1648
00:53:56,510 --> 00:53:57,730
Oh, that's why...

1649
00:53:57,730 --> 00:53:59,770
Oh, so there's more to this!

1650
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:02,370
Now we have to memorize this floor.

1651
00:54:02,670 --> 00:54:03,990
Okay, there's aspirin.

1652
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:05,150
There's a med kit.

1653
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:05,990
Our brother moved.

1654
00:54:07,450 --> 00:54:11,850
You know like the American healthcare system where you have to wait in the waiting room for hours?

1655
00:54:12,370 --> 00:54:13,650
He finally got it!

1656
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:14,730
Yeah!

1657
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:16,330
He's next!

1658
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:20,510
He just has to wait another five hours!

1659
00:54:20,570 --> 00:54:21,290
He just needs to wait another five hours!

1660
00:54:21,290 --> 00:54:23,110
Yeah, he needs to wait another five hours!

1661
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:25,730
But at least he gets a chair now!

1662
00:54:26,110 --> 00:54:26,610
He gets a chair?

1663
00:54:27,710 --> 00:54:29,770
Everything out here looks the same, I think.

1664
00:54:29,790 --> 00:54:30,970
I think it's the default.

1665
00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:32,090
I think it's the default.

1666
00:54:32,330 --> 00:54:35,930
Like, oh, this is what it looks like with no anomalies.

1667
00:54:36,850 --> 00:54:37,470
I think.

1668
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:38,430
It has to be.

1669
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:40,230
Because we started off on this floor.

1670
00:54:40,770 --> 00:54:41,930
Okay, let's look in here.

1671
00:54:41,990 --> 00:54:43,070
Okay, there's a big old couch.

1672
00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:44,290
There's two chairs.

1673
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:47,950
Oh yeah, memorize that with your non-photographic memory.

1674
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:49,570
Yeah, I'm going to.

1675
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:51,450
Plants, wheelchair...

1676
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:53,290
Two chairs here.

1677
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:55,650
Two chairs, two hospital beds.

1678
00:54:56,290 --> 00:54:57,230
There's a chair here.

1679
00:54:57,690 --> 00:54:57,850
Vitamins...

1680
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:00,170
More vitamins.

1681
00:55:00,850 --> 00:55:03,250
One, two, three, four, five hospital beds.

1682
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:05,390
And then it's like blue and then purple, purple.

1683
00:55:06,150 --> 00:55:07,090
Purple, blue.

1684
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:08,770
Alright, we should be good.

1685
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:10,950
We're not going to remember this.

1686
00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:12,170
This is why chat's here.

1687
00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:13,310
Chat, do your part.

1688
00:55:13,670 --> 00:55:14,850
Do your part, everybody.

1689
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:16,350
Do your part.

1690
00:55:16,570 --> 00:55:17,890
You love Helldivers too.

1691
00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:18,870
Now it's time to...

1692
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:21,490
It's just like Helldivers.

1693
00:55:23,710 --> 00:55:25,690
Why is everybody saying no help?

1694
00:55:26,610 --> 00:55:27,470
Why don't you...

1695
00:55:27,470 --> 00:55:28,750
Are your H keys broken?

1696
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:29,770
What's going on?

1697
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:31,730
101!

1698
00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:33,110
Let's go!

1699
00:55:33,770 --> 00:55:34,250
Yay!

1700
00:55:35,350 --> 00:55:35,830
Okay.

1701
00:55:35,990 --> 00:55:38,550
Is our brother in the hospital room?

1702
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:40,470
Let's check on him.

1703
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:41,750
Let's check on him.

1704
00:55:42,670 --> 00:55:45,290
I think everything looks the same out here.

1705
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:46,270
Yeah.

1706
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:48,950
Let's see.

1707
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:50,290
The paintings are the same.

1708
00:55:51,070 --> 00:55:52,390
The calendars are...

1709
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:52,490
Oh!

1710
00:55:52,510 --> 00:55:53,010
Oh!

1711
00:55:53,170 --> 00:55:54,310
This room is haunted!

1712
00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:55,250
This room is haunted!

1713
00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:56,030
Why?

1714
00:55:56,490 --> 00:55:57,170
Go check.

1715
00:55:59,470 --> 00:56:00,650
Go look, you baby.

1716
00:56:00,810 --> 00:56:01,350
Go look!

1717
00:56:02,550 --> 00:56:03,370
Go look!

1718
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:04,390
This room is haunted!

1719
00:56:04,550 --> 00:56:06,070
No, it's not!

1720
00:56:06,070 --> 00:56:07,490
Yes, it is!

1721
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:08,430
How is it haunted?

1722
00:56:08,570 --> 00:56:09,090
Look!

1723
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:14,280
It's your cousin!

1724
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:15,400
I know!

1725
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:16,600
It's your cousin!

1726
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:18,320
What is he doing here?

1727
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:20,000
What is...

1728
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,980
You are such a baby.

1729
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:23,360
She knows.

1730
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:25,700
You do!

1731
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:27,300
I didn't know.

1732
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:28,420
I didn't expect your...

1733
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:31,400
I didn't expect your cousin to come to this collab.

1734
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:34,500
It's actually my face reveal.

1735
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:35,440
Thank you very much.

1736
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:40,740
You have like a fucking ghost sheet underneath.

1737
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:44,720
That's underneath my skin suit.

1738
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:45,920
That's...

1739
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:48,140
So underneath my skin suit is a tomato.

1740
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:50,860
Underneath her skin suit is a Halloween costume.

1741
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:54,340
Underneath her skin suit is a tomato.

1742
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:54,400
Alright.

1743
00:56:55,130 --> 00:56:56,340
At least I don't rot.

1744
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:58,840
You know that!

1745
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:00,720
I could be like an alien tomato.

1746
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:03,980
You're not ripe anymore.

1747
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:05,300
You're not ripe anymore.

1748
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:06,120
Say something.

1749
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:07,440
What about the boomer code?

1750
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:10,800
It's like boomer.

1751
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:11,440
Get it?

1752
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:13,420
Because I say boo a lot.

1753
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:14,440
Then what is the mer for?

1754
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:16,420
What is the mer for?

1755
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:17,620
Mer.

1756
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:20,700
Wait.

1757
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,040
Did I just see something in there?

1758
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:22,820
What do you mean?

1759
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:23,180
Oh.

1760
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:24,500
So it's a baby now.

1761
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:25,540
Oh no.

1762
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:26,660
There's definitely something in there.

1763
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:26,980
Oh yeah.

1764
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:28,240
I see that.

1765
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:29,320
Wait.

1766
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:29,760
What?

1767
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:31,240
I went in last time.

1768
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:32,340
No you didn't!

1769
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:34,220
I know what you're talking about.

1770
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:34,760
Yes I did.

1771
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:35,420
Chat would have gone.

1772
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:36,040
I agree with me.

1773
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:37,680
What is that?

1774
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:38,720
What is that?

1775
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:39,280
We go in together.

1776
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:40,820
As twins we go in together.

1777
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:41,160
Okay.

1778
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:41,680
You go first.

1779
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:42,660
We can't go.

1780
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:42,980
Okay.

1781
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:43,900
You go first.

1782
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:44,400
I'll go in after.

1783
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:45,100
Go ahead.

1784
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:45,560
Okay.

1785
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:48,300
Oh it's a body bag.

1786
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,980
Oh it's like crunchy.

1787
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:52,380
It is?

1788
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:53,620
Oh.

1789
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:55,040
Why is it crunchy?

1790
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:55,980
Why is it crunchy?

1791
00:57:57,260 --> 00:57:59,380
Is he eating cereal in there?

1792
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:03,500
For playing the mortuary assistant again?

1793
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:05,300
Oh gosh.

1794
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,200
Please don't.

1795
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:08,580
Alright.

1796
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:08,920
Nice.

1797
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:10,880
I'd rather die again than play the game.

1798
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:14,320
Wait.

1799
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:16,680
So how many floors did we get to before we got to the 66?

1800
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:17,240
I don't remember.

1801
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:18,140
Honestly.

1802
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:19,440
I don't remember.

1803
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:21,260
We were...

1804
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:23,460
We definitely didn't do 100 floors.

1805
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:23,960
I think.

1806
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:25,820
Yeah.

1807
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:26,180
Oh.

1808
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:27,000
Wait.

1809
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:27,220
What?

1810
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:27,840
Did you hear that?

1811
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:28,660
Whoa.

1812
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:29,660
Wait.

1813
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:30,560
Another door opened.

1814
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:31,220
Oh.

1815
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:31,620
Okay.

1816
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:32,020
Never mind.

1817
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:32,560
It's closed.

1818
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:32,760
Okay.

1819
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:32,860
It's time to go.

1820
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:33,200
Yeah.

1821
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:33,600
It's time to go.

1822
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:34,280
It's time to go.

1823
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:36,140
Get out of here.

1824
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:36,560
Get out of here.

1825
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:41,340
If there's no one on the wheelchair, it's either a miracle or something happened.

1826
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:42,980
If someone can be a miracle?

1827
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:46,640
Wouldn't it be more of a miracle if they get out of the wheelchair?

1828
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:48,440
Wouldn't it be more of a miracle if they get out of the wheelchair?

1829
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:48,520
Yeah.

1830
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:50,800
But that means somebody just suddenly learned how to walk.

1831
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,400
And then they push the wheelchair away.

1832
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:55,020
And be like, I can walk now.

1833
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:55,640
Yay!

1834
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:57,700
I don't need it.

1835
00:58:57,780 --> 00:58:58,700
I don't need this.

1836
00:58:58,700 --> 00:58:59,320
I don't need this anymore.

1837
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:03,760
Okay.

1838
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,420
I think we're safe in this room now.

1839
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:07,920
Was he always staring at us?

1840
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:09,680
Yeah, he was always staring at us.

1841
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:10,340
That's our brother.

1842
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:10,780
No!

1843
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:10,880
No!

1844
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:11,140
No!

1845
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:11,560
No!

1846
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:11,980
No.

1847
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:12,480
No!

1848
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:19,960
He's being sensions, doggy!

1849
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,080
He's being sensions!

1850
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:22,880
He's being...

1851
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,240
He's just being wacky.

1852
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:26,660
He's just quirky.

1853
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:28,060
He's just being...

1854
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:29,680
Oh, Dewey.

1855
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:32,200
Dewey?

1856
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:35,840
I thought it was Huey!

1857
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:36,920
I remember it.

1858
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:38,620
They all like... the names all blur together.

1859
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:40,300
They truly do.

1860
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:42,280
Stop punching me, I'm sorry.

1861
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:43,840
What are you doing?

1862
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:44,780
You're being too slow!

1863
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:46,160
I was giving you a head start!

1864
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:48,420
I can't punch you anymore, I think.

1865
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:50,300
You've reached your punch limit.

1866
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:51,600
My punch quota.

1867
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:54,540
The punch quota of the day.

1868
00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:56,380
Another one?

1869
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:57,680
Anomaly.

1870
00:59:57,900 --> 00:59:59,380
What's up with all these anomalies?

1871
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:01,220
We're speedrunning!

1872
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:04,560
Oh my god, put us on speedrun.com!

1873
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:05,120
Yeah!

1874
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:07,040
Yeah, duospeedrun.com!

1875
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:07,260
We're at one hour!

1876
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:11,760
We're so fast!

1877
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:17,020
Oh, you got your punch quota back.

1878
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:18,040
I got my punch back!

1879
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:19,820
Every floor you get a new quota.

1880
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:22,800
Is this a normal room?

1881
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:25,500
Did we get a normal room this time?

1882
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:27,540
Let's see.

1883
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:30,120
I don't see anything.

1884
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:32,240
There's no weird faces in the pictures.

1885
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:34,720
There's no weird faces in the pictures?

1886
01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:39,640
If I look at a weird face, you look at a weird face.

1887
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:40,720
No!

1888
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:42,960
I think this is a normal room.

1889
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:44,440
I think so too?

1890
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:47,220
I think we got a normal room for once.

1891
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:49,300
Why is the shadows in this so weird?

1892
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:50,320
Oh yeah, that's true.

1893
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:53,100
My shadow is like going over there.

1894
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:54,880
Has this always been like 0000?

1895
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:55,860
Yeah, yeah.

1896
01:00:56,380 --> 01:00:57,180
It has.

1897
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:59,360
Okay, you can barely remember like...

1898
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:01,740
I looked at it earlier!

1899
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:05,220
Alright, aspirin.

1900
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:06,360
Yeah, I think this is normal.

1901
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:07,480
I think this is normal.

1902
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:07,980
Oh my god.

1903
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:09,840
It would be fucked up if it goes back to zero.

1904
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:12,640
Oh my god.

1905
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:14,520
No, there has to be like a...

1906
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:14,600
There's no way.

1907
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:15,340
There's like 100.

1908
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:16,200
There's like a checkpoint.

1909
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:16,780
Yeah.

1910
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:19,060
Yeah, 100 must be like our checkpoint.

1911
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:21,140
I think we did it.

1912
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:23,120
Right?

1913
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:24,080
I'm scared.

1914
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:25,920
We must have done it.

1915
01:01:27,140 --> 01:01:27,560
Okay.

1916
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:28,740
Oh, okay.

1917
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:29,080
Nice.

1918
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:29,660
107.

1919
01:01:30,580 --> 01:01:31,140
Nice.

1920
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:31,600
Oh my god.

1921
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:33,900
We finally got to see the other side.

1922
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:36,940
The other side of the...

1923
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:39,720
After so long, we've been like...

1924
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:41,480
We've been stuck in there for the longest time.

1925
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:42,640
Oh, anomaly.

1926
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:43,960
What's the anomaly?

1927
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:45,280
What?

1928
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:45,820
What?

1929
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:46,600
What?

1930
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:47,940
What?

1931
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:49,020
What did you see?

1932
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:50,160
What did you see?

1933
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:51,380
What did you see?

1934
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:53,160
What was it?

1935
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:55,160
He chased after me, Doki!

1936
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:56,140
What?

1937
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:57,540
He got up and...

1938
01:01:57,540 --> 01:01:57,860
He got up and he moved.

1939
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,320
He didn't need the wheelchair anymore.

1940
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:01,380
There was no one there.

1941
01:02:02,020 --> 01:02:02,760
He ran.

1942
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:03,600
He was running.

1943
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:04,700
He was running.

1944
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:07,340
I think he didn't take your meds.

1945
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:08,320
He ran at me!

1946
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:14,340
Oh, that was Doki up.

1947
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:17,100
Oh, wait.

1948
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:17,680
I mean...

1949
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:21,580
What happened?

1950
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:24,400
You saw me!

1951
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:25,420
I'm sorry.

1952
01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:26,040
I'm sorry.

1953
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:26,200
I'm

1954
01:02:29,290 --> 01:02:29,290
sorry.

1955
01:02:30,170 --> 01:02:30,610
I'm sorry.

1956
01:02:30,610 --> 01:02:31,570
What did you see?

1957
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:36,550
Okay, but there was an anomaly.

1958
01:02:36,830 --> 01:02:37,130
What?

1959
01:02:37,230 --> 01:02:40,290
The wheelchair was shaking.

1960
01:02:40,510 --> 01:02:44,210
But then I thought he got up and ran at me.

1961
01:02:44,250 --> 01:02:45,530
But it wasn't him.

1962
01:02:49,570 --> 01:02:51,950
I think we were in the hospital for a human.

1963
01:02:53,930 --> 01:02:55,670
He saw me.

1964
01:02:55,930 --> 01:02:59,410
It was like, he's chasing me.

1965
01:03:02,610 --> 01:03:04,570
Oh, wait, there's bodies in here.

1966
01:03:04,870 --> 01:03:06,490
There's bodies in here.

1967
01:03:06,510 --> 01:03:07,610
Oh, there's bodies in here.

1968
01:03:08,150 --> 01:03:09,090
You bitch!

1969
01:03:11,430 --> 01:03:13,430
Don't you want to see the bodies move?

1970
01:03:14,050 --> 01:03:15,530
I already saw them.

1971
01:03:16,270 --> 01:03:17,790
Let me rest.

1972
01:03:18,330 --> 01:03:20,310
Let me rest.

1973
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:24,150
109!

1974
01:03:24,910 --> 01:03:26,610
Give it up for 109.

1975
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:30,350
Someone in the chat was like, I know him.

1976
01:03:30,610 --> 01:03:33,230
Doki can be something, but calling her an anomaly.

1977
01:03:37,130 --> 01:03:38,250
SCP Tomato.

1978
01:03:42,550 --> 01:03:43,870
Oh my god.

1979
01:03:44,390 --> 01:03:46,910
Everything seems fine this time.

1980
01:03:49,510 --> 01:03:51,430
Are we not going to check the room?

1981
01:03:52,030 --> 01:03:53,570
You went in there, didn't you?

1982
01:03:53,670 --> 01:03:55,430
You don't want to do the room anymore?

1983
01:03:55,550 --> 01:03:58,670
I don't want to do the room anymore.

1984
01:03:59,350 --> 01:04:00,590
You still have the room.

1985
01:04:00,610 --> 01:04:03,050
I never left the room.

1986
01:04:04,870 --> 01:04:07,370
You still love going to the room.

1987
01:04:07,370 --> 01:04:07,790
I hate you.

1988
01:04:08,330 --> 01:04:08,850
Wait.

1989
01:04:11,410 --> 01:04:12,450
Oh, okay.

1990
01:04:12,570 --> 01:04:13,910
The wheelchair is here.

1991
01:04:14,010 --> 01:04:15,570
It was here and it was like shaking.

1992
01:04:15,830 --> 01:04:17,630
Oh, so that was the anomaly.

1993
01:04:17,950 --> 01:04:19,170
It was the wheelchair.

1994
01:04:19,950 --> 01:04:21,630
It was, but good thing.

1995
01:04:21,930 --> 01:04:22,770
Good thing.

1996
01:04:24,350 --> 01:04:24,870
Anomaly.

1997
01:04:27,050 --> 01:04:28,650
I don't think there is any.

1998
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:30,030
I don't think so either.

1999
01:04:30,130 --> 01:04:30,370
Is it good?

2000
01:04:30,370 --> 01:04:30,510
Yeah.

2001
01:04:30,610 --> 01:04:31,750
I think so.

2002
01:04:31,870 --> 01:04:34,110
Which would suck because we are about to hit a mile.

2003
01:04:34,110 --> 01:04:35,050
We are about to hit.

2004
01:04:35,070 --> 01:04:37,410
We are about to hit number 110.

2005
01:04:38,390 --> 01:04:39,350
110 baby.

2006
01:04:39,590 --> 01:04:40,070
110.

2007
01:04:40,950 --> 01:04:41,530
Let's go.

2008
01:04:42,050 --> 01:04:42,430
Let's go.

2009
01:04:46,730 --> 01:04:48,070
Is the light always like this?

2010
01:04:48,230 --> 01:04:49,230
Oh no, that's the orange light.

2011
01:04:49,950 --> 01:04:50,910
The orange.

2012
01:04:52,650 --> 01:04:54,010
It's the orange light.

2013
01:04:54,310 --> 01:04:56,790
You can't even keep your own story straight.

2014
01:04:57,430 --> 01:04:59,770
You thought the person running after you was me.

2015
01:05:00,170 --> 01:05:00,730
You thought the person running after you was me.

2016
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:02,090
I don't know.

2017
01:05:02,270 --> 01:05:03,730
I don't know what to expect.

2018
01:05:04,090 --> 01:05:06,890
May, June, July, we care about your health.

2019
01:05:07,230 --> 01:05:07,750
Okay.

2020
01:05:07,790 --> 01:05:08,770
Everything looks normal.

2021
01:05:09,290 --> 01:05:10,170
I think so too.

2022
01:05:10,290 --> 01:05:11,230
I don't see anomalies.

2023
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:12,770
Anomalies.

2024
01:05:13,130 --> 01:05:13,650
Anomalies.

2025
01:05:15,470 --> 01:05:15,990
Coffee.

2026
01:05:19,190 --> 01:05:21,250
The vending machine looks the same.

2027
01:05:22,890 --> 01:05:23,930
The vending machine looks the same.

2028
01:05:23,930 --> 01:05:24,810
Paintings look the same.

2029
01:05:25,070 --> 01:05:25,750
I think we are good too.

2030
01:05:26,170 --> 01:05:26,690
Oh!

2031
01:05:26,690 --> 01:05:26,830
Oh!

2032
01:05:28,070 --> 01:05:30,110
Look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look.

2033
01:05:30,430 --> 01:05:31,710
Come in here and look up.

2034
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:33,830
Oh, run, run, run.

2035
01:05:34,050 --> 01:05:34,450
Okay.

2036
01:05:34,870 --> 01:05:35,930
We are running, running.

2037
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:37,950
We are running, running, running.

2038
01:05:39,290 --> 01:05:40,650
We understood the rules.

2039
01:05:41,330 --> 01:05:42,010
We are running.

2040
01:05:42,510 --> 01:05:42,790
We are running.

2041
01:05:44,870 --> 01:05:45,930
Up we go.

2042
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:48,590
I like how we have a retry.

2043
01:05:48,810 --> 01:05:50,490
We are like, we don't know but like...

2044
01:05:52,310 --> 01:05:54,290
But let's just re-roll.

2045
01:05:54,990 --> 01:05:56,490
It's like, gotcha, we re-roll.

2046
01:05:56,690 --> 01:05:57,590
The anomaly.

2047
01:05:59,050 --> 01:05:59,750
Let's see.

2048
01:05:59,870 --> 01:06:01,570
Five extinguishers seems normal.

2049
01:06:03,590 --> 01:06:04,790
Exit seems normal.

2050
01:06:05,370 --> 01:06:05,910
Yeah.

2051
01:06:06,490 --> 01:06:07,470
Paintings seem normal.

2052
01:06:08,010 --> 01:06:08,550
Paintings.

2053
01:06:09,430 --> 01:06:13,650
The meds are all there because someone is still not taking their meds.

2054
01:06:13,850 --> 01:06:14,930
It's not me.

2055
01:06:15,030 --> 01:06:16,090
I don't know.

2056
01:06:17,610 --> 01:06:18,410
Wait, is something...

2057
01:06:18,410 --> 01:06:19,310
Yeah?

2058
01:06:19,550 --> 01:06:21,730
Is something different in here or am I crazy?

2059
01:06:21,730 --> 01:06:22,130
Let me check.

2060
01:06:22,370 --> 01:06:24,910
I mean, we all know you are crazy but like...

2061
01:06:24,910 --> 01:06:26,170
But am I like crazy?

2062
01:06:26,690 --> 01:06:28,890
Are you like, Manhera Manhera?

2063
01:06:31,470 --> 01:06:35,630
I'm like, are you the good Manhera or the bad Manhera?

2064
01:06:35,650 --> 01:06:36,830
What is the good Manhera?

2065
01:06:38,570 --> 01:06:42,610
The ones that are like, she might be crazy but I think I can fix her.

2066
01:06:42,770 --> 01:06:45,930
And then the bad one was like, there's no fixing her.

2067
01:06:46,110 --> 01:06:47,030
There's no fixing her.

2068
01:06:47,630 --> 01:06:49,450
I'm just here for the wild ride.

2069
01:06:49,890 --> 01:06:51,250
I think we're good here.

2070
01:06:51,530 --> 01:06:51,970
I think so too.

2071
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:54,970
The coffee all look the same.

2072
01:06:55,610 --> 01:06:56,890
There's one clock.

2073
01:06:57,230 --> 01:06:58,550
There's one clock.

2074
01:06:58,670 --> 01:07:00,390
There's all the coffee stuff.

2075
01:07:01,310 --> 01:07:01,910
Um...

2076
01:07:03,370 --> 01:07:05,150
The calendars look the same.

2077
01:07:05,270 --> 01:07:06,210
Yeah, I think we're fine.

2078
01:07:06,570 --> 01:07:08,250
Doki makes me Manhera.

2079
01:07:10,490 --> 01:07:11,510
What do you mean?

2080
01:07:11,550 --> 01:07:11,990
I...

2081
01:07:11,990 --> 01:07:15,150
I literally taught you how to use your own steam.

2082
01:07:18,710 --> 01:07:20,730
If anybody's going Manhera.

2083
01:07:24,970 --> 01:07:27,090
Okay, yay floor 1-1-2!

2084
01:07:27,590 --> 01:07:29,250
1-1-2 baby!

2085
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:30,970
I think we are going to 666.

2086
01:07:31,870 --> 01:07:32,490
No way.

2087
01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:34,130
There's no way.

2088
01:07:34,710 --> 01:07:37,310
Why are we at 112 floors?

2089
01:07:37,330 --> 01:07:38,230
We are already at 100.

2090
01:07:38,470 --> 01:07:38,770
Yeah.

2091
01:07:41,050 --> 01:07:41,610
Um...

2092
01:07:41,610 --> 01:07:45,650
Maybe it'll go from 112 to like 500 or something.

2093
01:07:45,830 --> 01:07:46,170
Yeah.

2094
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:47,290
We just skip two other floors.

2095
01:07:47,350 --> 01:07:49,850
The dev did not program enough.

2096
01:07:50,530 --> 01:07:54,670
There's no way there's enough anomalies to make 666 floors.

2097
01:07:54,730 --> 01:07:54,950
There's no way there's enough anomalies to make 666 floors.

2098
01:07:56,550 --> 01:07:57,550
There's no way.

2099
01:07:57,790 --> 01:07:58,410
There's no way.

2100
01:07:58,670 --> 01:08:01,230
Maybe like next patch update we add in more floors.

2101
01:08:02,390 --> 01:08:03,650
It's just like the spooky...

2102
01:08:03,650 --> 01:08:05,950
The DLC floors.

2103
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:07,910
Let's see.

2104
01:08:07,990 --> 01:08:08,930
I don't think I see anything.

2105
01:08:09,790 --> 01:08:11,670
The ceiling looks normal.

2106
01:08:12,490 --> 01:08:14,330
The meds are still there.

2107
01:08:16,270 --> 01:08:17,430
No one's taking them.

2108
01:08:17,710 --> 01:08:18,870
Wait, wait, the water cooler.

2109
01:08:19,090 --> 01:08:19,770
Oh look at that.

2110
01:08:19,790 --> 01:08:21,070
My chat's helping now.

2111
01:08:21,410 --> 01:08:22,510
What water cooler?

2112
01:08:22,930 --> 01:08:23,950
The water cooler.

2113
01:08:24,970 --> 01:08:25,610
What about it?

2114
01:08:25,650 --> 01:08:26,870
Is it this water cooler?

2115
01:08:27,870 --> 01:08:29,150
Which water cooler?

2116
01:08:29,290 --> 01:08:29,850
Oh the room.

2117
01:08:32,290 --> 01:08:35,130
I even walked up to the other ones.

2118
01:08:35,490 --> 01:08:36,550
Oh my god.

2119
01:08:36,830 --> 01:08:37,430
666.

2120
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:40,390
666 just like the doors.

2121
01:08:41,090 --> 01:08:41,930
See look at that.

2122
01:08:41,990 --> 01:08:43,910
My chat is doing their part.

2123
01:08:44,030 --> 01:08:44,410
Thanks chat.

2124
01:08:44,930 --> 01:08:46,570
Thanks dragoons.

2125
01:08:46,930 --> 01:08:47,710
Wait a second.

2126
01:08:48,070 --> 01:08:49,530
My chat said it too.

2127
01:08:50,010 --> 01:08:51,850
They said in the room.

2128
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:54,850
Yeah but my chat said the water cooler.

2129
01:08:56,070 --> 01:08:57,750
My chat probably said it too.

2130
01:08:57,910 --> 01:08:59,130
And I'm just not looking.

2131
01:08:59,390 --> 01:09:01,250
Oh so you're not reading your chat?

2132
01:09:02,550 --> 01:09:05,130
Yeah I'm neglecting them a little bit right now.

2133
01:09:06,950 --> 01:09:07,850
Sorry chat.

2134
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:08,690
Sorry chat.

2135
01:09:08,930 --> 01:09:09,670
It's okay.

2136
01:09:10,110 --> 01:09:10,350
Alright.

2137
01:09:10,610 --> 01:09:11,430
Let's see.

2138
01:09:11,450 --> 01:09:12,170
They're not so needy.

2139
01:09:12,170 --> 01:09:12,970
Not like the dragoons.

2140
01:09:12,990 --> 01:09:13,450
Whoa!

2141
01:09:14,290 --> 01:09:18,850
The wisps are just as needy as the dragoons.

2142
01:09:19,090 --> 01:09:20,650
Stop saying she hates us.

2143
01:09:20,650 --> 01:09:20,970
Stop!

2144
01:09:21,270 --> 01:09:21,550
Stop!

2145
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:25,870
Oh my god.

2146
01:09:26,230 --> 01:09:27,530
You're supposed to be chill.

2147
01:09:27,910 --> 01:09:29,370
She's supposed to be chill.

2148
01:09:30,370 --> 01:09:31,510
Okay no.

2149
01:09:31,770 --> 01:09:33,630
We care about your health.

2150
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:34,750
The medical center.

2151
01:09:35,470 --> 01:09:36,650
I think this is a...

2152
01:09:36,650 --> 01:09:37,830
Fire.

2153
01:09:37,990 --> 01:09:38,710
Exit.

2154
01:09:38,710 --> 01:09:39,190
Exit.

2155
01:09:39,190 --> 01:09:39,550
Water.

2156
01:09:40,130 --> 01:09:40,530
Fire.

2157
01:09:40,530 --> 01:09:43,010
This seems to be an okay room.

2158
01:09:43,510 --> 01:09:44,230
Guys.

2159
01:09:44,510 --> 01:09:45,210
I think so.

2160
01:09:45,450 --> 01:09:47,170
Besides you.

2161
01:09:48,490 --> 01:09:50,530
What's that supposed to mean?

2162
01:09:51,750 --> 01:09:52,970
We're here for you.

2163
01:09:53,030 --> 01:09:55,250
You haven't taken your meds since floor one.

2164
01:09:55,550 --> 01:09:57,350
We're here for the both of us.

2165
01:09:58,010 --> 01:10:01,250
Maybe all the triplets are fucked up.

2166
01:10:03,310 --> 01:10:03,870
Alright.

2167
01:10:04,030 --> 01:10:04,770
One one four!

2168
01:10:05,690 --> 01:10:07,270
One one four!

2169
01:10:08,350 --> 01:10:08,910
Yay!

2170
01:10:09,770 --> 01:10:09,990
Yay!

2171
01:10:10,690 --> 01:10:11,630
We're doing it.

2172
01:10:11,650 --> 01:10:12,910
We haven't failed even once.

2173
01:10:12,950 --> 01:10:13,710
This is crazy.

2174
01:10:14,190 --> 01:10:14,490
Yeah.

2175
01:10:14,550 --> 01:10:16,330
Just like for VOD watchers.

2176
01:10:16,370 --> 01:10:17,810
Skip the first 30 minutes.

2177
01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:20,630
Skip the first 30 minutes.

2178
01:10:20,650 --> 01:10:23,410
But we haven't failed once.

2179
01:10:23,710 --> 01:10:24,830
Hey June July.

2180
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:25,830
Alright.

2181
01:10:25,830 --> 01:10:28,210
I feel like the calendar would have anomalies soon.

2182
01:10:28,910 --> 01:10:31,370
Because I feel like the words are gonna change on the calendar.

2183
01:10:31,630 --> 01:10:31,710
Oh!

2184
01:10:32,050 --> 01:10:32,870
There's an anomaly.

2185
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:34,150
Anomaly?

2186
01:10:34,370 --> 01:10:35,090
What's the anomaly?

2187
01:10:35,630 --> 01:10:36,230
Go check.

2188
01:10:36,530 --> 01:10:37,550
See if you can find it.

2189
01:10:37,610 --> 01:10:37,990
Okay.

2190
01:10:38,950 --> 01:10:39,390
I found it.

2191
01:10:39,430 --> 01:10:39,810
You find it.

2192
01:10:41,250 --> 01:10:41,650
Exit.

2193
01:10:41,730 --> 01:10:42,110
Oh!

2194
01:10:42,350 --> 01:10:43,490
There's the devs!

2195
01:10:44,410 --> 01:10:45,210
Is that the dev?

2196
01:10:45,310 --> 01:10:46,190
I think it is.

2197
01:10:46,210 --> 01:10:47,290
It's the dev on this PC.

2198
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:48,610
Oh you're right!

2199
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:49,370
Oh my god!

2200
01:10:49,390 --> 01:10:49,690
Oh my god!

2201
01:10:49,690 --> 01:10:50,550
He's watching his play!

2202
01:10:50,650 --> 01:10:51,850
He's actually watching.

2203
01:10:51,850 --> 01:10:52,790
He's actually moving.

2204
01:10:53,050 --> 01:10:53,470
Oh my god!

2205
01:10:53,830 --> 01:10:55,910
He tapped into us.

2206
01:10:55,930 --> 01:10:56,310
He's smiling at you.

2207
01:10:56,370 --> 01:10:57,190
He's smiling at you.

2208
01:10:57,230 --> 01:10:58,170
He's watching us.

2209
01:11:01,630 --> 01:11:02,410
Oh my god.

2210
01:11:02,430 --> 01:11:05,890
Is this like what it feels to like when we see our chat watch us at the panels?

2211
01:11:06,350 --> 01:11:09,110
This is what I see when I like end the stream.

2212
01:11:13,870 --> 01:11:15,470
Now it's just sad.

2213
01:11:15,470 --> 01:11:15,550
Oh my god!

2214
01:11:18,570 --> 01:11:20,350
1, 1, 5!

2215
01:11:20,750 --> 01:11:21,350
5!

2216
01:11:21,510 --> 01:11:22,230
We're here!

2217
01:11:23,210 --> 01:11:23,810
Okay.

2218
01:11:23,830 --> 01:11:24,310
Nice.

2219
01:11:24,510 --> 01:11:26,450
When are we getting another SCP?

2220
01:11:26,930 --> 01:11:27,450
Yeah.

2221
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:29,590
Where's your other SCPs?

2222
01:11:30,470 --> 01:11:31,070
Okay.

2223
01:11:31,730 --> 01:11:32,570
Checking the calendar.

2224
01:11:32,570 --> 01:11:32,910
Seems normal.

2225
01:11:33,630 --> 01:11:34,950
May, June, July.

2226
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:36,230
We care about your health.

2227
01:11:36,490 --> 01:11:38,030
We care about your health.

2228
01:11:39,290 --> 01:11:41,050
Min, we care about you.

2229
01:11:41,330 --> 01:11:43,670
You gotta please take your meds.

2230
01:11:43,810 --> 01:11:45,350
Oh shit!

2231
01:11:46,090 --> 01:11:46,650
AHHHHHHHHHH!

2232
01:11:49,110 --> 01:11:50,690
He wasn't there before!

2233
01:11:51,350 --> 01:11:52,250
Yeah I know!

2234
01:11:52,250 --> 01:11:53,670
I was just like I did a double D.

2235
01:11:53,790 --> 01:11:54,610
I was like what the fuck!

2236
01:11:54,790 --> 01:11:56,230
Where did he come from?

2237
01:11:57,770 --> 01:11:59,730
He's just there at the door.

2238
01:12:00,050 --> 01:12:01,930
Look he cares about your health Min.

2239
01:12:02,110 --> 01:12:03,410
He cares about your health.

2240
01:12:03,410 --> 01:12:03,670
He cares about your health.

2241
01:12:06,090 --> 01:12:07,650
The shadow man.

2242
01:12:07,830 --> 01:12:08,690
He's here.

2243
01:12:10,370 --> 01:12:10,930
Okay.

2244
01:12:11,870 --> 01:12:12,430
Okay.

2245
01:12:12,570 --> 01:12:14,330
This is a really tall hospital.

2246
01:12:14,390 --> 01:12:15,050
Not gonna lie.

2247
01:12:15,470 --> 01:12:15,810
I know.

2248
01:12:16,010 --> 01:12:17,890
How many sick people are there?

2249
01:12:18,050 --> 01:12:20,570
I think they have other things to worry about.

2250
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:22,450
They need to make a hospital this big.

2251
01:12:22,750 --> 01:12:25,910
I feel like it's like the only hospital in the country.

2252
01:12:26,210 --> 01:12:28,910
They've demolished all the hospitals.

2253
01:12:29,230 --> 01:12:31,130
And just kept this one.

2254
01:12:32,710 --> 01:12:33,190
And just kept this one.

2255
01:12:33,190 --> 01:12:33,230
And just kept this one.

2256
01:12:33,230 --> 01:12:34,930
I think we're fine.

2257
01:12:35,650 --> 01:12:36,130
I think we're fine.

2258
01:12:36,130 --> 01:12:37,110
We haven't even been in here.

2259
01:12:38,430 --> 01:12:39,630
I think we're fine.

2260
01:12:39,790 --> 01:12:40,690
I think we're fine.

2261
01:12:40,770 --> 01:12:42,730
Has there always been this many plugs?

2262
01:12:42,730 --> 01:12:44,170
Outlets in the hospital?

2263
01:12:44,690 --> 01:12:45,670
I don't know.

2264
01:12:45,770 --> 01:12:46,430
I wasn't looking.

2265
01:12:46,890 --> 01:12:46,930
I don't know.

2266
01:12:47,050 --> 01:12:48,510
You've been to a hospital before.

2267
01:12:49,170 --> 01:12:50,010
I have.

2268
01:12:50,610 --> 01:12:51,830
Oh my god I thought that was you.

2269
01:12:52,210 --> 01:12:53,470
Wait he's too big!

2270
01:12:53,930 --> 01:12:55,250
I was gonna say he looks different.

2271
01:12:55,250 --> 01:12:56,030
He looks huge.

2272
01:12:56,470 --> 01:12:57,170
Oh my god.

2273
01:12:57,530 --> 01:12:59,510
He drank a lot of milk.

2274
01:12:59,810 --> 01:13:00,270
Brother.

2275
01:13:01,290 --> 01:13:03,150
We're all supposed to be the same size.

2276
01:13:03,870 --> 01:13:04,690
No wait.

2277
01:13:04,810 --> 01:13:06,030
I think we're just small.

2278
01:13:06,510 --> 01:13:06,550
We're small.

2279
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:09,130
Are we getting smaller?

2280
01:13:09,290 --> 01:13:10,790
I think we are.

2281
01:13:12,730 --> 01:13:13,070
No!

2282
01:13:13,670 --> 01:13:19,690
We gotta hurry back or we're gonna go back to the room!

2283
01:13:19,750 --> 01:13:20,150
Oh my god.

2284
01:13:20,150 --> 01:13:21,390
It also shrunk.

2285
01:13:22,150 --> 01:13:24,010
Oh my god we like grew back up.

2286
01:13:26,630 --> 01:13:27,490
Oh no.

2287
01:13:27,950 --> 01:13:29,270
It's SCP time.

2288
01:13:29,550 --> 01:13:32,190
What SCP is this?

2289
01:13:32,450 --> 01:13:32,770
Where are you?

2290
01:13:33,490 --> 01:13:34,990
I saw a maze for a second.

2291
01:13:35,170 --> 01:13:37,430
Wait where are you?

2292
01:13:37,730 --> 01:13:38,510
There you are.

2293
01:13:39,610 --> 01:13:40,690
There's things coming out!

2294
01:13:41,230 --> 01:13:42,830
Wait there's bodies coming out!

2295
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:45,690
What's the maze rule?

2296
01:13:46,830 --> 01:13:47,590
That's not it!

2297
01:13:47,930 --> 01:13:48,050
Ah!

2298
01:13:55,970 --> 01:13:57,150
Run from me!

2299
01:13:57,270 --> 01:13:57,890
Wait you're dead?

2300
01:13:58,090 --> 01:13:59,790
He touched me!

2301
01:14:00,090 --> 01:14:01,410
He touched me and I died!

2302
01:14:01,450 --> 01:14:02,990
You just have to avoid him!

2303
01:14:03,090 --> 01:14:05,130
Oh my god.

2304
01:14:05,570 --> 01:14:06,390
There's a ton of them!

2305
01:14:08,890 --> 01:14:09,770
Run around!

2306
01:14:09,950 --> 01:14:12,610
Run around face through them!

2307
01:14:12,650 --> 01:14:13,110
You're a ghost!

2308
01:14:13,590 --> 01:14:14,410
Oh they stopped.

2309
01:14:14,530 --> 01:14:14,830
Hey there.

2310
01:14:15,290 --> 01:14:15,690
Oh!

2311
01:14:15,770 --> 01:14:16,030
Oh!

2312
01:14:20,070 --> 01:14:20,870
I gamed.

2313
01:14:20,930 --> 01:14:21,510
I'm a gamer.

2314
01:14:21,650 --> 01:14:25,010
Okay so I saw the dead end and I ran back to the dead end.

2315
01:14:25,130 --> 01:14:27,570
Why did you do that?

2316
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:28,750
Why did you do that?

2317
01:14:28,850 --> 01:14:29,710
Why did you do that?

2318
01:14:29,790 --> 01:14:32,790
You put me in a maze you might as well just say goodbye to me.

2319
01:14:34,430 --> 01:14:35,590
We have a new room!

2320
01:14:35,830 --> 01:14:36,830
Oh it's 200!

2321
01:14:37,210 --> 01:14:37,830
We're at 200!

2322
01:14:38,970 --> 01:14:40,910
Yeah we have a new room it's at the end this time.

2323
01:14:41,110 --> 01:14:41,830

Wait no no it's... yeah it is.

2325
01:14:45,070 --> 01:14:45,930
It's the other door.

2326
01:14:47,030 --> 01:14:48,370
Look I'm directionally...

2327
01:14:48,370 --> 01:14:49,130
Wait so this is all the normal.

2328
01:14:49,310 --> 01:14:51,730
Yeah this is the normal and we gotta figure out the...

2329
01:14:51,730 --> 01:14:52,850
Oh my god.

2330
01:14:53,010 --> 01:14:53,750
Oh there's our brother!

2331
01:14:53,950 --> 01:14:55,650
He's finally got into the...

2332
01:14:55,650 --> 01:14:58,090
He's not even on the exam table!

2333
01:14:58,170 --> 01:14:59,590
He has a bullet in his neck!

2334
01:14:59,650 --> 01:15:00,950
He has a tumor in his neck!

2335
01:15:01,770 --> 01:15:02,950
Oh my god what happened to you?

2336
01:15:02,950 --> 01:15:03,130
Brother!

2337
01:15:03,570 --> 01:15:04,010
Brother!

2338
01:15:04,630 --> 01:15:05,070
Brother no!

2339
01:15:10,150 --> 01:15:11,850
This is how we find out!

2340
01:15:12,590 --> 01:15:14,330
No at floor 200?

2341
01:15:14,390 --> 01:15:14,810
No at floor 200?

2342
01:15:14,830 --> 01:15:16,130
Oh my god!

2343
01:15:16,510 --> 01:15:19,110
Is that a bullet or a tumor?

2344
01:15:19,250 --> 01:15:19,790
I can't tell.

2345
01:15:20,090 --> 01:15:21,050
What is that?

2346
01:15:21,790 --> 01:15:23,830
He got shot in the neck?

2347
01:15:24,870 --> 01:15:26,290
That's why he can't speak!

2348
01:15:26,590 --> 01:15:26,950
Brother no!

2349
01:15:27,350 --> 01:15:29,350
No brother!

2350
01:15:29,910 --> 01:15:31,790
You have to talk to us!

2351
01:15:32,650 --> 01:15:34,450
Brother we're worried about you!

2352
01:15:34,870 --> 01:15:36,550
The doctors...

2353
01:15:36,550 --> 01:15:41,110
You just need to wait 10 more hours and the doctors will be here to help with the surgery!

2354
01:15:41,970 --> 01:15:43,910
It's just a bullet don't worry about it!

2355
01:15:43,910 --> 01:15:44,810
Don't mind the fact that we're here!

2356
01:15:45,630 --> 01:15:48,550
Don't mind the fact that this is where all the dead bodies go brother!

2357
01:15:48,730 --> 01:15:50,670
It is possible to save you!

2358
01:15:51,090 --> 01:15:54,990
Yeah why is the morgue in the same place?

2359
01:15:56,050 --> 01:15:57,350
That's the x-rays?

2369
01:16:14,830 --> 01:16:16,930
Oh I'm sorry for the details.

We're here to spot the anomalies!

2381
01:16:37,710 --> 01:16:41,470

01:17:14,110 --> 01:17:15,310
You don't even speak French!

2402
01:17:16,110 --> 01:17:17,150
Ah oui!

01:17:35,670 --> 01:17:35,850
That's how you say Doki in French by the way.

2411
01:17:35,850 --> 01:17:36,210
Doki.

2412
01:17:36,410 --> 01:17:38,290
Je m'appelle Doki.

2413
01:17:39,750 --> 01:17:41,010
It's like...

2414
01:17:42,030 --> 01:17:44,270
Boku no namae wa Toby Fox.

2415
01:17:44,270 --> 01:17:44,310
Boku no namae wa Toby Fox.

2416
01:17:45,010 --> 01:17:45,850
Let's say that!

2417
01:17:49,890 --> 01:17:50,410
Alright.

2418
01:17:50,670 --> 01:17:51,270
Let's see.

2419
01:17:51,370 --> 01:17:52,430
Oh this is apparently CPR.

2420
01:17:52,770 --> 01:17:53,390
Cause they're kissing.

2421
01:17:54,190 --> 01:17:55,890
Yeah yeah yeah they're kissing!

2422
01:17:56,490 --> 01:17:57,590
We're gonna do that to our brother?

2423
01:17:59,150 --> 01:18:00,330
Preparation and execution.

2424
01:18:00,870 --> 01:18:03,090
We're gonna kiss the bullet away.

2425
01:18:04,010 --> 01:18:05,930
We're gonna suck it out of his throat.

2426
01:18:05,930 --> 01:18:06,610
Like a vacuum.

2427
01:18:10,410 --> 01:18:11,770
That's what brothers do!

2428
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:13,410
That's what brothers do!

2429
01:18:13,570 --> 01:18:14,990
They suck the bullets out of his throat!

2430
01:18:15,010 --> 01:18:15,190
Yeah!

2431
01:18:15,370 --> 01:18:17,150
Get yourself a true brother!

2432
01:18:17,530 --> 01:18:19,810
That'll suck the bullet out of your neck!

2433
01:18:22,090 --> 01:18:26,930
If you don't kiss your brother for him to leave you're not a real brother.

2434
01:18:27,390 --> 01:18:27,990
That's true.

2435
01:18:28,270 --> 01:18:29,210
Wait was that always there?

2436
01:18:29,270 --> 01:18:30,890
The yellow sign thing?

2437
01:18:31,490 --> 01:18:32,670
Oh I don't know actually.

2438
01:18:33,010 --> 01:18:33,630
I think so.

2439
01:18:33,990 --> 01:18:34,870
Was that always there?

2440
01:18:36,470 --> 01:18:37,390
I think so.

2441
01:18:37,390 --> 01:18:38,410
You sure?

2442
01:18:39,910 --> 01:18:41,550
Um there's an anomaly.

2443
01:18:42,290 --> 01:18:43,350
Oh shit.

2444
01:18:43,950 --> 01:18:45,630
Why are you running backwards?

2445
01:18:46,250 --> 01:18:47,410
Oh my bad.

2446
01:18:47,550 --> 01:18:50,570
Why did you run forward?

2447
01:18:50,570 --> 01:18:52,850
Why did you run forward?

2448
01:18:53,550 --> 01:18:54,970
Why did you run forward?

2449
01:18:54,970 --> 01:18:56,690
I didn't die!

2450
01:18:57,310 --> 01:18:57,330
I didn't die!

2451
01:18:58,310 --> 01:18:59,650
Like someone.

2452
01:19:00,070 --> 01:19:02,330
You didn't even see the body bag.

2453
01:19:02,550 --> 01:19:05,110
I literally said there's an anomaly.

2454
01:19:05,170 --> 01:19:07,370
I literally said there's an anomaly.

2455
01:19:08,710 --> 01:19:10,290
I saw it first!

2456
01:19:11,210 --> 01:19:13,310
Yeah but you stayed there!

2457
01:19:14,190 --> 01:19:17,390
No I literally you pushed me back into the room!

2458
01:19:17,430 --> 01:19:18,590
I don't know what you're talking about.

2459
01:19:18,650 --> 01:19:19,950
I don't think I pushed anybody back.

2460
01:19:20,290 --> 01:19:22,270
That is he says she says.

2461
01:19:22,370 --> 01:19:24,190
He says she says.

2462
01:19:25,330 --> 01:19:27,390
Sally sells cheese shells at the store.

2463
01:19:27,710 --> 01:19:29,690
I can't even say that.

2464
01:19:30,090 --> 01:19:31,610
You can't even say it!

2465
01:19:31,730 --> 01:19:33,030
What is it then?

2466
01:19:33,130 --> 01:19:33,790
What is it?

2467
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:36,430
Sally sells sea shells by the sea shore!

2468
01:19:36,710 --> 01:19:36,870
Yes!

2469
01:19:38,030 --> 01:19:40,490
She says she says.

2470
01:19:40,790 --> 01:19:42,810
Sally sells sea shells by the sea.

2471
01:19:46,010 --> 01:19:46,890
I'm sorry!

2472
01:19:47,170 --> 01:19:51,430
I was in ESL class as English is my first language.

2473
01:19:51,730 --> 01:19:53,650
But English is your first language.

2474
01:19:53,730 --> 01:19:55,910
Yeah I was put in ESL when I was younger.

2475
01:19:57,750 --> 01:19:59,130
Doctor says I'm special.

2476
01:19:59,130 --> 01:20:00,010
Yeah you needed it.

2477
01:20:00,010 --> 01:20:00,790
You needed it clearly.

2478
01:20:01,730 --> 01:20:03,490
I think this floor is good.

2479
01:20:03,870 --> 01:20:04,990
Yeah I think so too.

2480
01:20:05,190 --> 01:20:06,710
I don't think there's any anomalies.

2481
01:20:07,390 --> 01:20:07,850
I don't think so.

2482
01:20:07,850 --> 01:20:08,530
Two oh three!

2483
01:20:10,270 --> 01:20:10,790
Bing!

2484
01:20:13,830 --> 01:20:14,350
Yeah!

2485
01:20:14,630 --> 01:20:16,230
That took a lot longer.

2486
01:20:16,470 --> 01:20:19,710
It was actually deciding if we were right.

2487
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:22,210
Do we give her that one?

2488
01:20:22,490 --> 01:20:23,630
Do we give her that one?

2489
01:20:23,630 --> 01:20:24,850
They don't want to.

2490
01:20:25,010 --> 01:20:26,990
They don't want to give us the point.

2491
01:20:27,290 --> 01:20:30,150
They're like I don't think they actually figured it out.

2492
01:20:30,510 --> 01:20:31,190
They're like I don't think they actually figured it out.

2493
01:20:31,190 --> 01:20:32,370
I think I heard something.

2494
01:20:32,990 --> 01:20:34,070
Inside the room?

2495
01:20:34,630 --> 01:20:35,370
I don't know.

2496
01:20:35,450 --> 01:20:37,230
It sounded like flickering lights or something.

2497
01:20:37,650 --> 01:20:39,090
We care about your health.

2498
01:20:39,150 --> 01:20:40,170
May, June, July.

2499
01:20:40,410 --> 01:20:43,490
This calendar has been the same thing over and over again.

2500
01:20:43,630 --> 01:20:44,690
Over and over again.

2501
01:20:44,930 --> 01:20:47,310
When is there like something new on the calendar?

2502
01:20:47,890 --> 01:20:48,370
Brother.

2503
01:20:48,590 --> 01:20:49,070
Brother.

2504
01:20:49,490 --> 01:20:51,810
Why is there still a bullet in your neck?

2505
01:20:51,830 --> 01:20:53,090
Please talk to us brother.

2506
01:20:54,090 --> 01:20:56,170
That's all we want from you.

2507
01:20:57,950 --> 01:20:59,830
We just want you to talk to us.

2508
01:20:59,870 --> 01:21:00,730
We miss you brother.

2509
01:21:01,510 --> 01:21:04,030
We miss your singing brother.

2510
01:21:04,390 --> 01:21:04,570
We miss your singing brother.

2511
01:21:04,810 --> 01:21:06,630
The meds are fine.

2512
01:21:07,070 --> 01:21:08,750
I think everything on this floor is fine.

2513
01:21:08,990 --> 01:21:10,170
The coffee is fine.

2514
01:21:10,590 --> 01:21:12,370
The clock still says 6.

2515
01:21:12,850 --> 01:21:13,490
30.

2516
01:21:14,570 --> 01:21:15,210
666.

2517
01:21:15,990 --> 01:21:18,030
There's no sixes on the doors.

2518
01:21:18,350 --> 01:21:20,730
I was like why is my chat doing smileys?

2519
01:21:21,190 --> 01:21:21,830
Yeah.

2520
01:21:23,610 --> 01:21:25,070
Up we go.

2521
01:21:26,010 --> 01:21:27,510
2, 0, 4!

2522
01:21:29,790 --> 01:21:30,430
4?

2523
01:21:30,610 --> 01:21:30,710
4?

2524
01:21:30,730 --> 01:21:31,350
4?

2525
01:21:32,490 --> 01:21:34,130
2, 0, 4!

2526
01:21:34,750 --> 01:21:35,270
Yeah!

2527
01:21:35,610 --> 01:21:38,750
We see the elevator drop down.

2528
01:21:39,410 --> 01:21:40,330
I know.

2529
01:21:40,410 --> 01:21:41,970
I would literally cry.

2530
01:21:42,830 --> 01:21:44,370
We went through the maze.

2531
01:21:47,010 --> 01:21:48,050
Oh, anomaly.

2532
01:21:48,370 --> 01:21:49,050
What's the anomaly?

2533
01:21:49,470 --> 01:21:50,490
Come on, let's go inside.

2534
01:21:50,690 --> 01:21:51,530
No, we gotta see it together.

2535
01:21:51,830 --> 01:21:53,250
I saw it, I saw it.

2536
01:21:53,310 --> 01:21:53,870
You go see it.

2537
01:21:54,090 --> 01:21:55,690
Oh no, he's sad!

2538
01:21:56,710 --> 01:21:57,230
Laughter.

2539
01:21:58,390 --> 01:21:58,910
Laughter.

2540
01:22:00,730 --> 01:22:01,030
No!

2541
01:22:01,110 --> 01:22:02,830
He's sad now!

2542
01:22:03,330 --> 01:22:05,910
He realized it's terminal.

2543
01:22:07,430 --> 01:22:07,950
He's a bully.

2544
01:22:09,070 --> 01:22:09,790
Oh well.

2545
01:22:10,230 --> 01:22:11,650
We can have another brother.

2546
01:22:13,670 --> 01:22:14,830
Oh my god.

2547
01:22:15,150 --> 01:22:15,530
Chill out.

2548
01:22:15,530 --> 01:22:15,950
What happened?

2549
01:22:16,530 --> 01:22:18,130
What's going on with you?

2550
01:22:18,330 --> 01:22:21,870
I'm letting my issues out because my brother's dying.

2551
01:22:23,030 --> 01:22:23,790
Come on.

2552
01:22:23,790 --> 01:22:24,450
Come on, come on, Doki.

2553
01:22:24,490 --> 01:22:25,470
We gotta leave the elevator.

2554
01:22:25,770 --> 01:22:26,950
We gotta go find the anomaly.

2555
01:22:27,650 --> 01:22:29,050
Yeah, that's right.

2556
01:22:29,070 --> 01:22:30,710
You can't hit me back on the back of the elevator.

2557
01:22:31,470 --> 01:22:32,610
I'm in the corner.

2558
01:22:33,410 --> 01:22:34,290
Yeah, yeah.

2559
01:22:34,550 --> 01:22:35,230
Let's see.

2560
01:22:35,530 --> 01:22:36,450
Oh, he's happy again!

2561
01:22:37,230 --> 01:22:38,750
Oh wait, what the fuck is that?

2562
01:22:38,990 --> 01:22:39,070
Oh!

2563
01:22:42,820 --> 01:22:43,380
Go in.

2564
01:22:43,780 --> 01:22:44,780
Go in.

2565
01:22:46,260 --> 01:22:47,060
What's the anomaly?

2566
01:22:47,340 --> 01:22:48,660
Go closer to it.

2567
01:22:48,820 --> 01:22:51,020
You found it.

2568
01:22:51,780 --> 01:22:52,740
No, no, no, no.

2569
01:22:53,020 --> 01:22:53,880
That's not the rule.

2570
01:22:54,020 --> 01:22:55,740
Because last time you didn't do that either.

2571
01:22:56,300 --> 01:22:57,300
What are you talking about?

2572
01:22:57,700 --> 01:22:58,500
We do it together.

2573
01:22:58,720 --> 01:22:59,260
We're a team.

2574
01:22:59,780 --> 01:23:01,180
That's all we have now.

2575
01:23:01,220 --> 01:23:02,020
Our brother's dying.

2576
01:23:02,980 --> 01:23:03,800
What are you doing?

2577
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:04,200
Come on.

2578
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:04,980
Get over there.

2579
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:06,680
I don't think I can smack you anymore.

2580
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:08,720
You reached your quota.

2581
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:09,860
Get closer!

2582
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:12,020
It's just a man with a brain.

2583
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:14,200
It's the opposite of us.

2584
01:23:14,220 --> 01:23:15,500
Is he like clipping through?

2585
01:23:17,460 --> 01:23:18,500
You see, class?

2586
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:19,780
That's where our brain is.

2587
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:24,680
I actually can't tell if it's like a head.

2588
01:23:24,820 --> 01:23:26,800
It's like he's like clip through.

2589
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:28,000
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

2590
01:23:28,140 --> 01:23:29,060
He's like clip through.

2591
01:23:29,580 --> 01:23:30,220
Alright, come on.

2592
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:30,720
Let's get closer.

2593
01:23:30,860 --> 01:23:31,440
Let's get closer.

2594
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:31,980
Come on.

2595
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:34,220
What do you want to say?

2596
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:34,440
Hi.

2597
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:36,880
I think he's just chilling there.

2598
01:23:36,940 --> 01:23:37,200
He's just smiling.

2599
01:23:37,460 --> 01:23:37,940
Wait, I don't think...

2600
01:23:37,940 --> 01:23:40,860
Is that a brain or is he wearing like a handkerchief on his head?

2601
01:23:41,020 --> 01:23:41,360
Yeah.

2602
01:23:42,580 --> 01:23:43,440
It's a handkerchief.

2603
01:23:43,820 --> 01:23:44,680
It's a handkerchief.

2604
01:23:47,660 --> 01:23:49,380
I was like, wait a minute.

2605
01:23:49,420 --> 01:23:50,220
That looks like claws.

2606
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:53,500
I can't believe it.

2607
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:54,380
He didn't come after us.

2608
01:23:54,380 --> 01:23:55,920
Yeah, he was just saying hi.

2609
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:57,100
He looked really like sinister.

2610
01:23:57,520 --> 01:23:58,680
Yeah, he was just like, hey.

2611
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:01,800
That's what he does on his free time.

2612
01:24:03,420 --> 01:24:03,780
Alright.

2613
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:06,320
Okay, it's your turn to go to that room.

2614
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:07,700
I'm going to look at the other anomalies.

2615
01:24:07,900 --> 01:24:08,840
Oh, I found the anomaly.

2616
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:09,360
Oh, okay.

2617
01:24:09,780 --> 01:24:10,340
Never mind.

2618
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:13,060
Why can't we do this together?

2619
01:24:13,220 --> 01:24:13,740
What am I?

2620
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:14,260
What am I?

2621
01:24:14,620 --> 01:24:15,200
Come on.

2622
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:15,900
It's the anomaly.

2623
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,520
What the fuck is that?

2624
01:24:19,580 --> 01:24:20,480
Wait, that's just a kid.

2625
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:23,280
It's just a kid.

2626
01:24:24,280 --> 01:24:25,900
It's literally just a kid.

2627
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:28,860
They get like, kid PNG on Google.

2628
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:31,480
No, it's a kid.

2629
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:33,100
It's just a kid.

2630
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:34,620
What's he doing there?

2631
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:38,000
It's like a doctor's, like the children's hospital.

2632
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:41,060
They put it in to make it seem more friendly.

2633
01:24:41,140 --> 01:24:43,260
They put a child in the lights.

2634
01:24:43,820 --> 01:24:45,060
It's like a skibbity.

2635
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:46,080
A skibbity?

2636
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:46,660
Oh, no.

2637
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:50,480
This is when boomers try to relate to the young people.

2638
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:52,580
They just say, you hate kids.

2639
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:53,720
Skibbity.

2640
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:55,860
You can't just say skibbity.

2641
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:56,740
Skibbity all the time, Doki.

2642
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:57,340
Oh my god.

2643
01:25:07,410 --> 01:25:08,910
Go in there, I dare you.

2644
01:25:10,610 --> 01:25:12,150
What do you mean I dare you?

2645
01:25:12,210 --> 01:25:13,070
Oh, what the fuck?

2646
01:25:13,070 --> 01:25:14,210
I triple dog dare you.

2647
01:25:15,350 --> 01:25:17,050
What the fuck do you mean go in there?

2648
01:25:17,570 --> 01:25:19,210
I triple dog dare you.

2649
01:25:19,290 --> 01:25:20,010
Come on, go in there.

2650
01:25:21,570 --> 01:25:23,370
You got his chest and them.

2651
01:25:24,050 --> 01:25:25,850
Oh, you met your punch quota.

2652
01:25:25,990 --> 01:25:27,050
Don't make me punch you.

2653
01:25:27,090 --> 01:25:28,450
I know you met your punch quota.

2654
01:25:29,430 --> 01:25:30,290
Oh, it's back up.

2655
01:25:30,350 --> 01:25:30,950
Okay, I guess.

2656
01:25:30,950 --> 01:25:32,950
I guess I can go in there.

2657
01:25:33,050 --> 01:25:33,990
I mean, if you insist.

2658
01:25:34,590 --> 01:25:35,810
If you insist.

2659
01:25:37,330 --> 01:25:38,330
Is it working?

2660
01:25:44,350 --> 01:25:45,470
Oh my god.

2661
01:25:45,750 --> 01:25:49,850
I triple dog dare you to jump over that cliff right now.

2662
01:25:50,130 --> 01:25:51,310
You were too baby.

2663
01:25:51,390 --> 01:25:52,470
You couldn't even go in.

2664
01:25:53,050 --> 01:25:53,730
Oh, yeah.

2665
01:25:53,810 --> 01:25:55,650
As the blades are rolling down.

2666
01:25:55,950 --> 01:25:56,810
Oh my god.

2667
01:25:56,810 --> 01:25:57,830
You're too baby.

2668
01:25:59,530 --> 01:26:00,770
I went in.

2669
01:26:00,790 --> 01:26:02,010
I went in the door shut.

2670
01:26:02,130 --> 01:26:03,210
It was like so crazy.

2671
01:26:03,250 --> 01:26:04,650
Well, it wasn't you went in.

2672
01:26:04,710 --> 01:26:05,650
I punched you in.

2673
01:26:05,910 --> 01:26:07,090
Yeah, that's really true.

2674
01:26:07,990 --> 01:26:10,190
These rooms always have the anomalies.

2675
01:26:10,190 --> 01:26:10,850
They're kind of crazy.

2676
01:26:11,070 --> 01:26:15,130
Yeah, I think it's because like, I think like the devs ran out of ideas for the main area.

2677
01:26:15,390 --> 01:26:17,430
So they're just put it all in here now.

2678
01:26:17,490 --> 01:26:19,190
Maybe we've exhausted all of them.

2679
01:26:19,210 --> 01:26:20,230
Like we've seen all of them.

2680
01:26:20,250 --> 01:26:23,290
They're like, please leave the hospital.

2681
01:26:23,310 --> 01:26:24,210
We're done here.

2682
01:26:25,090 --> 01:26:26,570
I don't think there was an anomaly.

2683
01:26:27,830 --> 01:26:28,470
Does anyone see anything?

2684
01:26:28,690 --> 01:26:28,950
Water.

2685
01:26:30,230 --> 01:26:31,470
I'm triple checking.

2686
01:26:31,610 --> 01:26:32,610
I'm gonna go look at the sign.

2687
01:26:32,750 --> 01:26:34,070
The caution sign.

2688
01:26:34,110 --> 01:26:35,430
I'm gonna look at the painting again.

2689
01:26:35,710 --> 01:26:36,810
I think it's done.

2690
01:26:37,230 --> 01:26:37,770
Wet floor.

2691
01:26:39,210 --> 01:26:39,690
Water.

2692
01:26:40,650 --> 01:26:42,170
This floor is always wet.

2693
01:26:42,230 --> 01:26:43,350
Where's the fucking janitor?

2694
01:26:44,390 --> 01:26:46,330
What do you mean this floor is always wet?

2695
01:26:46,550 --> 01:26:47,350
There's a wet sign.

2696
01:26:47,710 --> 01:26:49,030
It's been here since the beginning.

2697
01:26:49,630 --> 01:26:51,130
Why is every floor wet?

2698
01:26:51,510 --> 01:26:52,330
Wait, no we're not.

2699
01:26:53,370 --> 01:26:54,130
What do you mean?

2700
01:26:54,130 --> 01:26:56,450
Has this page always been like peeled off?

2701
01:26:57,350 --> 01:26:58,130
What page?

2702
01:26:58,350 --> 01:26:58,670
This one.

2703
01:27:00,750 --> 01:27:02,490
Has this page always been peeled off?

2704
01:27:03,110 --> 01:27:04,050
I think so.

2705
01:27:04,170 --> 01:27:05,930
I don't think they would do something that subtle.

2706
01:27:06,170 --> 01:27:06,990
Okay, no it's this.

2707
01:27:12,190 --> 01:27:12,670
666!

2708
01:27:13,570 --> 01:27:14,050
666!

2709
01:27:14,050 --> 01:27:14,070
666!

2710
01:27:14,070 --> 01:27:16,130
You will never get 666!

2711
01:27:17,250 --> 01:27:18,090
You will never get 666!

2712
01:27:18,090 --> 01:27:19,430
Never get 666?

2713
01:27:19,650 --> 01:27:20,390
Is that what it says?

2714
01:27:20,410 --> 01:27:21,730
Yeah, you will never get 666!

2715
01:27:21,730 --> 01:27:23,730
Oh you will never get 666!

2716
01:27:27,310 --> 01:27:27,810
666!

2717
01:27:29,350 --> 01:27:31,430
Oh yeah, we're gonna prove you wrong!

2718
01:27:32,110 --> 01:27:34,490
We told you this was a 24 hour stream!

2719
01:27:35,030 --> 01:27:37,190
Oh my god, it's actually gonna go to 666.

2720
01:27:37,190 --> 01:27:38,410
I told you!

2721
01:27:38,750 --> 01:27:40,710
This floor is 666!

2722
01:27:41,350 --> 01:27:44,890
You know, I honestly thought this was gonna be a short game.

2723
01:27:45,670 --> 01:27:46,730
I thought so too.

2724
01:27:46,910 --> 01:27:48,410
I thought it was gonna be like 20 floors.

2725
01:27:48,550 --> 01:27:50,710
Just like the exit 8.

2726
01:27:51,030 --> 01:27:51,710
But we're at 666.

2727
01:27:51,730 --> 01:27:52,890
We're actually going to 666.

2728
01:27:53,650 --> 01:27:55,550
But we like jump a lot.

2729
01:27:55,850 --> 01:27:56,410
That's true.

2730
01:27:57,490 --> 01:27:58,530
Isn't it the plants?

2731
01:27:58,850 --> 01:28:01,910
We're both looking at the anomalies together!

2732
01:28:02,690 --> 01:28:03,210
Yeah!

2733
01:28:03,330 --> 01:28:04,370
I'm finding them!

2734
01:28:04,450 --> 01:28:05,090
I'm finding them!

2735
01:28:05,190 --> 01:28:06,030
I found all of them.

2736
01:28:06,250 --> 01:28:08,210
I found every single one so far.

2737
01:28:08,390 --> 01:28:09,270
You haven't even found them!

2738
01:28:09,530 --> 01:28:10,830
This is a Wii game!

2739
01:28:11,010 --> 01:28:14,570
You were like, oh I told you!

2740
01:28:15,290 --> 01:28:15,810
You!

2741
01:28:17,490 --> 01:28:18,190
Okay, okay.

2742
01:28:18,190 --> 01:28:19,570
You think there's no anomaly?

2743
01:28:20,830 --> 01:28:21,630
I don't know.

2744
01:28:21,810 --> 01:28:23,890
I think there's no anomaly.

2745
01:28:24,610 --> 01:28:25,130
Oh.

2746
01:28:25,730 --> 01:28:27,050
Did you find an anomaly?

2747
01:28:27,450 --> 01:28:28,370
No, I think there's no anomaly.

2748
01:28:31,610 --> 01:28:32,930
I don't trust you.

2749
01:28:37,030 --> 01:28:38,110
I'm going back.

2750
01:28:38,650 --> 01:28:41,490
I'm going back to cover your tracks.

2751
01:28:41,550 --> 01:28:41,650
I'm going back to cover your tracks.

2752
01:28:41,650 --> 01:28:41,730
Mint!

2753
01:28:42,770 --> 01:28:45,790
Is there an anomaly in this room?

2754
01:28:48,270 --> 01:28:49,050
Yes!

2755
01:28:49,550 --> 01:28:51,010
What is it?

2756
01:28:53,170 --> 01:28:56,710
Can you tell me what the anomaly is?

2757
01:28:57,770 --> 01:28:58,950
The X-Ray!

2758
01:28:59,770 --> 01:29:00,550
Yay!

2759
01:29:01,970 --> 01:29:04,530
Can you say X-Ray?

2760
01:29:05,270 --> 01:29:06,590
X-Ray!

2761
01:29:11,130 --> 01:29:13,530
The X-Ray in French.

2762
01:29:14,310 --> 01:29:15,090
What?

2763
01:29:15,090 --> 01:29:15,270
What?

2764
01:29:15,270 --> 01:29:15,670
What?

2765
01:29:15,670 --> 01:29:15,750
What?

2766
01:29:16,890 --> 01:29:18,010
Say that again!

2767
01:29:18,310 --> 01:29:21,050
Can you say the X-Ray in French?

2768
01:29:21,190 --> 01:29:22,250
The X-Ray?

2769
01:29:22,290 --> 01:29:23,130
The X-Ray!

2770
01:29:25,610 --> 01:29:26,750
Up we go!

2771
01:29:28,130 --> 01:29:29,510
Oh my god.

2772
01:29:30,390 --> 01:29:32,690
You're like Boots in Andorra.

2773
01:29:36,590 --> 01:29:37,230
Okay.

2774
01:29:37,550 --> 01:29:40,030
I think all the anomalies are just in that room.

2775
01:29:46,210 --> 01:29:48,510
I was like, boom!

2776
01:29:48,690 --> 01:29:49,690
And I jumped.

2777
01:29:50,070 --> 01:29:51,670
We didn't even say anything.

2778
01:29:51,830 --> 01:29:52,850
We just turned around.

2779
01:29:55,730 --> 01:29:57,070
Okay, here we go.

2780
01:29:57,130 --> 01:29:59,430
At least I run out of the elevator.

2781
01:29:59,630 --> 01:30:00,610
You just walk out.

2782
01:30:00,610 --> 01:30:01,970
You crawl out like a baby.

2783
01:30:01,970 --> 01:30:02,810
That is not true.

2784
01:30:02,810 --> 01:30:04,310
I was hydrating.

2785
01:30:04,610 --> 01:30:06,290
You're waiting for me.

2786
01:30:06,490 --> 01:30:08,830
You're waiting for me to run into anything.

2787
01:30:09,470 --> 01:30:09,650
I was not.

2788
01:30:09,650 --> 01:30:10,650
Nuh-uh.

2789
01:30:13,090 --> 01:30:14,530
Oh, you're typing.

2790
01:30:14,530 --> 01:30:15,770
I'm coming to this room.

2791
01:30:15,790 --> 01:30:16,350
You're in the room with me?

2792
01:30:17,530 --> 01:30:18,950
Who's the baby now?

2793
01:30:20,690 --> 01:30:22,690
I thought that was you again.

2794
01:30:22,990 --> 01:30:25,990
I thought somebody was running at you again.

2795
01:30:26,230 --> 01:30:28,030
I don't think there's an anomaly this time.

2796
01:30:28,710 --> 01:30:29,950
We don't know yet.

2797
01:30:29,970 --> 01:30:30,690
We don't know yet.

2798
01:30:31,670 --> 01:30:32,230
I'm pretty sure.

2799
01:30:32,230 --> 01:30:34,670
There really is nothing in the outside.

2800
01:30:34,950 --> 01:30:37,810
Yeah, I think all the stuff is now just in this room.

2801
01:30:37,990 --> 01:30:38,770
Hey, that makes it easier.

2802
01:30:39,410 --> 01:30:40,310
It really does.

2803
01:30:40,790 --> 01:30:44,690
And before they add, they actually add one anomaly outside.

2804
01:30:50,090 --> 01:30:50,490
I'm sorry.

2805
01:30:50,490 --> 01:30:51,010
Is there anything?

2806
01:30:53,190 --> 01:30:54,370
I really don't see anything.

2807
01:30:54,390 --> 01:30:55,230
I don't see anything also.

2808
01:30:56,430 --> 01:30:57,730
My chat was like, look up.

2809
01:30:57,790 --> 01:30:59,150
But there's nothing up top.

2810
01:30:59,890 --> 01:31:01,010
Oh, are we supposed to look up?

2811
01:31:01,170 --> 01:31:02,290
Gamers don't look up, you guys.

2812
01:31:02,330 --> 01:31:06,930
If somebody adds stuff upstairs, then they're not a real gamer.

2813
01:31:07,590 --> 01:31:08,430
They're a poser.

2814
01:31:09,810 --> 01:31:11,230
Check behind the standing whiteboard.

2815
01:31:11,310 --> 01:31:11,590
You know what?

2816
01:31:11,610 --> 01:31:11,890
You're right.

2817
01:31:11,890 --> 01:31:13,650
I was looking there earlier and I forgot.

2818
01:31:15,650 --> 01:31:16,170
Wait, what?

2819
01:31:16,170 --> 01:31:17,710
What do you mean look up?

2820
01:31:17,930 --> 01:31:19,050
They keep saying look up.

2821
01:31:20,010 --> 01:31:21,910
Stop, don't... I am not up.

2822
01:31:22,190 --> 01:31:23,390
They said look up!

2823
01:31:24,410 --> 01:31:25,470
I'm looking up!

2824
01:31:27,030 --> 01:31:29,330
There's like something up top.

2825
01:31:30,450 --> 01:31:32,310
Are they gaslighting us?

2826
01:31:32,770 --> 01:31:34,510
I think they're gaslighting you, yeah.

2827
01:31:34,730 --> 01:31:35,350
There has to be.

2828
01:31:35,410 --> 01:31:36,510
Everybody's saying look up.

2829
01:31:37,910 --> 01:31:39,630
No, they're saying gamers, subs.

2830
01:31:40,170 --> 01:31:41,330
Oh, yeah.

2831
01:31:42,390 --> 01:31:46,210
Anyway, check out gamers, subs, code, don't keep it.

2832
01:31:46,510 --> 01:31:47,930
It's called boomer.

2833
01:31:49,750 --> 01:31:51,470
Oh, wait, there's no... I think we're good.

2834
01:31:51,750 --> 01:31:53,750
No, everybody keeps saying look up.

2835
01:31:53,970 --> 01:31:54,470
I don't know.

2836
01:31:55,450 --> 01:31:56,790
They're fucking with us.

2837
01:31:56,930 --> 01:31:58,690
I don't know.

2838
01:31:59,550 --> 01:32:00,950
They're not saying that to me.

2839
01:32:01,030 --> 01:32:02,170
I think they're fucking with you.

2840
01:32:02,410 --> 01:32:02,930
Oh, okay.

2841
01:32:02,990 --> 01:32:03,570
Yeah, you're right.

2842
01:32:04,170 --> 01:32:04,790
You're right.

2843
01:32:04,830 --> 01:32:05,530
I think so too.

2844
01:32:05,590 --> 01:32:06,770
So I guess there's no anomalies.

2845
01:32:08,090 --> 01:32:08,530
Right?

2846
01:32:10,090 --> 01:32:10,530
Right.

2847
01:32:11,890 --> 01:32:12,170
Yeah.

2848
01:32:12,510 --> 01:32:14,190
Everyone keeps saying the smile.

2849
01:32:15,210 --> 01:32:16,130
What smile?

2850
01:32:16,770 --> 01:32:18,230
The smile in the room.

2851
01:32:18,590 --> 01:32:20,430
No, let's go back and look at the room.

2852
01:32:20,650 --> 01:32:21,130
I can't.

2853
01:32:21,230 --> 01:32:23,230
They keep saying they missed it.

2854
01:32:23,270 --> 01:32:24,430
They're yelling that I'm blind.

2855
01:32:25,730 --> 01:32:26,290
What?

2856
01:32:26,490 --> 01:32:27,950
They're saying we're blind.

2857
01:32:28,230 --> 01:32:30,330
My chat is not saying that.

2858
01:32:30,630 --> 01:32:32,450
Are you sure you're not looking at your chat?

2859
01:32:32,790 --> 01:32:33,790
I am looking.

2860
01:32:35,890 --> 01:32:37,350
There's nothing here.

2861
01:32:37,430 --> 01:32:40,370
What is your chat saying about my chat?

2862
01:32:41,310 --> 01:32:43,850
They're saying she's getting gaslight.

2863
01:32:44,650 --> 01:32:45,930
Everyone's saying the smile.

2864
01:32:46,190 --> 01:32:47,350
What do you mean by the smile?

2865
01:32:48,430 --> 01:32:49,710
Where's the smile?

2866
01:32:50,070 --> 01:32:51,090
Don't punch me.

2867
01:32:51,130 --> 01:32:52,910
Don't take your impression off me.

2868
01:32:56,170 --> 01:32:57,930
What are you saying about the smile?

2869
01:32:57,950 --> 01:32:58,770
What are you talking about?

2870
01:32:58,950 --> 01:32:59,610
It's dokey.

2871
01:33:02,010 --> 01:33:03,050
Dragoons smh.

2872
01:33:03,050 --> 01:33:04,230
So true chat.

2873
01:33:05,270 --> 01:33:08,610
Dragoons, are you really going to let the wist say that about you?

2874
01:33:09,830 --> 01:33:10,350
Punch me.

2875
01:33:10,350 --> 01:33:11,150
Fight, fight, fight.

2876
01:33:12,610 --> 01:33:14,250
You know the meme?

2877
01:33:14,410 --> 01:33:15,910
The Simpsons meme with the monkeys fighting?

2878
01:33:16,230 --> 01:33:18,130
And then the people...

2879
01:33:19,310 --> 01:33:20,510
Surrounding them with money.

2880
01:33:22,090 --> 01:33:23,970
Okay, we're going to level 12.

2881
01:33:25,090 --> 01:33:26,510
It's going to be level 12.

2882
01:33:26,570 --> 01:33:26,970
212.

2883
01:33:28,790 --> 01:33:29,350
212.

2884
01:33:31,050 --> 01:33:33,870
Oh, I was getting gaslighted.

2885
01:33:34,510 --> 01:33:35,050
You again?

2886
01:33:38,830 --> 01:33:40,230
Don't take it out on me.

2887
01:33:40,830 --> 01:33:43,210
You're really going to let the wist do this to you.

2888
01:33:43,490 --> 01:33:45,010
The wisps are good.

2889
01:33:46,930 --> 01:33:48,270
May, June, July.

2890
01:33:48,510 --> 01:33:49,710
We care about your health.

2891
01:33:49,850 --> 01:33:51,030
We care about your health.

2892
01:33:52,230 --> 01:33:53,030
Wait a second.

2893
01:33:53,230 --> 01:33:56,230
Oh, I thought something was different.

2894
01:33:56,550 --> 01:33:58,670
I think everything looks the same.

2895
01:33:58,710 --> 01:33:59,610
There's outlets here.

2896
01:34:00,870 --> 01:34:03,070
Son os electricer.

2897
01:34:07,410 --> 01:34:07,930
Wait.

2898
01:34:08,010 --> 01:34:08,870
We're the same height.

2899
01:34:10,610 --> 01:34:12,490
We're the same height as our brother.

2900
01:34:14,330 --> 01:34:15,670
Yeah, everything looks the same.

2901
01:34:16,830 --> 01:34:17,250
Oh!

2902
01:34:18,330 --> 01:34:19,530
Wasn't this on the other side?

2903
01:34:20,130 --> 01:34:21,150
No, it was always there.

2904
01:34:21,190 --> 01:34:21,530
Never mind.

2905
01:34:21,770 --> 01:34:23,870
Yeah, the car was always there.

2906
01:34:24,170 --> 01:34:25,110
No, I meant this.

2907
01:34:26,110 --> 01:34:26,850
Oh, the chair?

2908
01:34:27,210 --> 01:34:29,430
No, this... whatever this...

2909
01:34:29,430 --> 01:34:30,170
No, this was always here.

2910
01:34:30,210 --> 01:34:30,550
Never mind.

2911
01:34:30,670 --> 01:34:31,370
It was always here.

2912
01:34:32,330 --> 01:34:33,970
I was thinking about this thing.

2913
01:34:34,110 --> 01:34:35,370
Like the little camera thing.

2914
01:34:35,370 --> 01:34:36,110
You're gaslighting yourself.

2915
01:34:37,410 --> 01:34:39,690
You can't trust nobody, not even yourself.

2916
01:34:40,190 --> 01:34:40,390
Not even yourself.

2917
01:34:40,830 --> 01:34:42,810
These games make you paranoid, man.

2918
01:34:42,870 --> 01:34:44,990
They're like, where's the anomaly?

2919
01:34:45,370 --> 01:34:46,510
Where's the fucking anomaly?

2920
01:34:47,130 --> 01:34:48,090
But like...

2921
01:34:48,090 --> 01:34:48,990
Everything looks the same.

2922
01:34:49,370 --> 01:34:50,470
Yeah, I think so.

2923
01:34:50,790 --> 01:34:52,110
I don't think there's any difference here.

2924
01:34:52,950 --> 01:34:53,650
It looks normal.

2925
01:34:55,910 --> 01:34:57,230
Yeah, this looks normal.

2926
01:34:57,470 --> 01:34:58,210
I guess we go.

2927
01:34:58,990 --> 01:35:00,110
Alright, here we go.

2928
01:35:00,130 --> 01:35:00,810
Are the tiles bigger?

2929
01:35:01,050 --> 01:35:01,890
I don't think so.

2930
01:35:02,470 --> 01:35:03,510
Can we look up?

2931
01:35:05,010 --> 01:35:05,770
I'm looking up!

2932
01:35:05,890 --> 01:35:06,790
I'm looking up!

2933
01:35:07,010 --> 01:35:07,910
I looked up!

2934
01:35:08,390 --> 01:35:08,990
I looked up.

2935
01:35:09,130 --> 01:35:09,710
We're good.

2936
01:35:09,910 --> 01:35:10,490
Alright, here we go.

2937
01:35:11,430 --> 01:35:12,090
Next floor.

2938
01:35:13,710 --> 01:35:14,150
Yay!

2939
01:35:14,530 --> 01:35:15,530
2-13!

2940
01:35:16,230 --> 01:35:18,210
Wait, people are saying there was an extra light switch.

2941
01:35:18,550 --> 01:35:18,990
Uh oh.

2942
01:35:20,090 --> 01:35:20,830
Don't say that.

2943
01:35:21,790 --> 01:35:22,670
2-13!

2944
01:35:22,790 --> 01:35:24,170
See, you're gaslighting too!

2945
01:35:24,190 --> 01:35:24,850
What the hell!

2946
01:35:25,430 --> 01:35:27,390
The Winsome gaslighting you too!

2947
01:35:28,510 --> 01:35:30,030
Oh, I found the anomaly.

2948
01:35:30,350 --> 01:35:31,210
I found it too.

2949
01:35:31,390 --> 01:35:31,850
Yeah, let's go.

2950
01:35:32,750 --> 01:35:34,550
I don't wanna go in that cold.

2951
01:35:35,290 --> 01:35:38,190
I think our brother is getting his operation right now.

2952
01:35:38,310 --> 01:35:38,770
Finally!

2953
01:35:39,330 --> 01:35:40,910
That means it's been 5 hours.

2954
01:35:43,950 --> 01:35:46,810
He went through 2 different rooms.

2955
01:35:47,610 --> 01:35:49,290
I don't even know what light switch they mean.

2956
01:35:49,830 --> 01:35:51,010
I think they just made it up.

2957
01:35:51,090 --> 01:35:52,150
Oh, these two maybe.

2958
01:35:52,350 --> 01:35:53,570
So there's always been 2.

2959
01:35:53,730 --> 01:35:54,050
Brother!

2960
01:35:54,190 --> 01:35:56,270
Did they take away the bullet?

2961
01:35:57,210 --> 01:35:58,130
I think they did.

2962
01:35:58,370 --> 01:36:00,170
I think he looks a little happier now.

2963
01:36:00,410 --> 01:36:00,510
I think he looks a little happier now.

2964
01:36:01,890 --> 01:36:02,370
I'm pretty sure.

2965
01:36:03,110 --> 01:36:04,470
You see that smile?

2966
01:36:04,870 --> 01:36:06,090
There's a QR code!

2967
01:36:06,410 --> 01:36:09,630
Is it to this YouTube channel?

2968
01:36:10,090 --> 01:36:10,650
I know it.

2969
01:36:11,330 --> 01:36:12,610
It's getting darker.

2970
01:36:13,210 --> 01:36:13,910
Is it?

2971
01:36:13,990 --> 01:36:14,550
Oh, it is.

2972
01:36:15,250 --> 01:36:17,030
Scan that QR code!

2973
01:36:17,230 --> 01:36:18,170
Where does it go to?

2974
01:36:19,250 --> 01:36:20,510
It's fully dark now.

2975
01:36:20,650 --> 01:36:21,430
Where does it go, guys?

2976
01:36:21,730 --> 01:36:22,250
Scan it!

2977
01:36:22,970 --> 01:36:24,890
I bet you it goes to...

2978
01:36:24,890 --> 01:36:26,830
It goes to like YouTube.

2979
01:36:27,130 --> 01:36:27,510
My affiliate link.

2980
01:36:30,330 --> 01:36:31,430
It goes to...

2981
01:36:31,430 --> 01:36:33,110
It goes to men's gamer subs.

2982
01:36:34,190 --> 01:36:36,070
Someone just said, I got a virus.

2983
01:36:39,170 --> 01:36:40,770
My chat was like, hold still.

2984
01:36:40,830 --> 01:36:42,510
We can't scan it because you're moving.

2985
01:36:42,610 --> 01:36:44,190
It's a YouTube link.

2986
01:36:44,410 --> 01:36:46,730
Oh, it's a Rickroll.

2987
01:36:47,990 --> 01:36:48,850
No way.

2988
01:36:48,850 --> 01:36:50,390
It's a Rickroll.

2989
01:36:50,670 --> 01:36:51,090
Wait, it has?

2990
01:36:51,530 --> 01:36:52,170
No way.

2991
01:36:52,270 --> 01:36:52,550
Hold on.

2992
01:36:52,710 --> 01:36:54,290
Are you going to scan it?

2993
01:36:54,450 --> 01:36:55,990
Is it actually a Rickroll?

2994
01:36:57,670 --> 01:36:59,190
It's like a 5 second...

2995
01:36:59,190 --> 01:37:00,650
It's like a 5 second clip.

2996
01:37:00,750 --> 01:37:01,270
It's unlisted.

2997
01:37:01,830 --> 01:37:02,910
Oh, what is it?

2998
01:37:03,250 --> 01:37:04,030
I don't know.

2999
01:37:04,050 --> 01:37:04,790
It's a black screen.

3000
01:37:05,030 --> 01:37:05,990
I can't figure out.

3001
01:37:05,990 --> 01:37:06,930
Put that volume up.

3002
01:37:07,390 --> 01:37:08,050
I'm trying.

3003
01:37:09,150 --> 01:37:10,570
Oh my god, it's disappearing.

3004
01:37:14,550 --> 01:37:15,090
What the fuck?

3005
01:37:15,110 --> 01:37:15,430
What did you say?

3006
01:37:15,490 --> 01:37:17,050
Can you hear me?

3007
01:37:17,190 --> 01:37:18,670
I heard it.

3008
01:37:18,690 --> 01:37:19,590
I heard it on your end.

3009
01:37:21,230 --> 01:37:21,610
What?

3010
01:37:22,250 --> 01:37:23,370
I can't hear him.

3011
01:37:23,450 --> 01:37:24,510
Wait, play again.

3012
01:37:24,850 --> 01:37:26,370
I'm turning off my noise gate.

3013
01:37:26,690 --> 01:37:27,070
Okay.

3014
01:37:27,570 --> 01:37:28,510
Can you hear me?

3015
01:37:30,170 --> 01:37:31,550
I'm trapped in the game.

3016
01:37:31,710 --> 01:37:34,150
Oh, I'm trapped in the game.

3017
01:37:34,450 --> 01:37:35,490
Oh my god.

3018
01:37:35,870 --> 01:37:36,850
Oh my god.

3019
01:37:36,930 --> 01:37:38,830
There's another Vtuber in here?

3020
01:37:39,630 --> 01:37:41,370
I think we need to leave.

3021
01:37:42,850 --> 01:37:45,990
How dare they come to our stream.

3022
01:37:46,550 --> 01:37:46,670
How dare they come to our stream.

3023
01:37:46,670 --> 01:37:48,170
This is an exclusive collab.

3024
01:37:48,390 --> 01:37:50,190
This is an exclusive collab.

3025
01:37:50,470 --> 01:37:52,930
What are you trying to do coming to our stream?

3026
01:37:53,110 --> 01:37:53,670
What are you trying to do coming to our stream?

3027
01:37:53,670 --> 01:37:54,010
In our game.

3028
01:37:54,010 --> 01:37:55,350
You thought it was a Rickroll?

3029
01:37:55,350 --> 01:37:57,530
People in chat were saying it's a Rickroll.

3030
01:37:58,310 --> 01:38:01,070
I didn't know they didn't even bother to scan it.

3031
01:38:01,330 --> 01:38:02,130
I didn't know they didn't even bother to scan it.

3032
01:38:02,330 --> 01:38:05,430
Look, see I went into that room first because I'm brave.

3033
01:38:06,410 --> 01:38:07,170
Look, see I went into that room first because I'm brave.

3034
01:38:07,170 --> 01:38:07,850
Fuck you.

3035
01:38:08,570 --> 01:38:09,350
Fuck you.

3036
01:38:09,950 --> 01:38:10,330
Alright.

3037
01:38:11,030 --> 01:38:12,150
This looks the same.

3038
01:38:12,470 --> 01:38:15,410
Our brother's been possessed.

3039
01:38:15,750 --> 01:38:16,330
Wait, what do you mean?

3040
01:38:16,610 --> 01:38:18,510
Stop punching me.

3041
01:38:18,930 --> 01:38:21,670
Oh my god.

3042
01:38:22,270 --> 01:38:23,710
He's looking at me.

3043
01:38:24,010 --> 01:38:25,190
He's obsessed with me.

3044
01:38:25,210 --> 01:38:25,330
Oh my god.

3045
01:38:25,330 --> 01:38:25,330
He's obsessed with me.

3046
01:38:25,350 --> 01:38:26,690
Oh my god.

3047
01:38:26,690 --> 01:38:26,690
He's obsessed with me.

3048
01:38:26,690 --> 01:38:26,970
Brother, no.

3049
01:38:27,110 --> 01:38:27,790
It's not Alabama.

3050
01:38:28,230 --> 01:38:28,570
Brother, no.

3051
01:38:29,250 --> 01:38:30,410
It's not Alabama.

3052
01:38:30,790 --> 01:38:31,270
Brother.

3053
01:38:32,570 --> 01:38:34,170
That bullet's sitting...

3054
01:38:35,430 --> 01:38:36,090
Don't say that.

3055
01:38:37,470 --> 01:38:40,470
Wait, isn't it normally at 16 that we get to the...

3056
01:38:40,470 --> 01:38:40,570
Wait, isn't it normally at 16 that we get to the...

3057
01:38:40,570 --> 01:38:41,370
When do we get to the...

3058
01:38:41,370 --> 01:38:42,970
I think at 16 we do.

3059
01:38:43,110 --> 01:38:43,290
Yeah.

3060
01:38:43,570 --> 01:38:45,110
Yeah, so we have to get through this one.

3061
01:38:47,290 --> 01:38:49,410
I think everything looks the same.

3062
01:38:49,890 --> 01:38:54,650
You say that literally two seconds into walking into the room.

3063
01:38:54,810 --> 01:38:55,330
You say that literally two seconds into walking into the room.

3064
01:38:55,330 --> 01:38:56,470
Everything looks the same.

3065
01:38:56,850 --> 01:38:57,690
That's how much I need.

3066
01:38:57,770 --> 01:38:59,110
That's all the intel I need.

3067
01:38:59,890 --> 01:39:00,750
It's one room.

3068
01:39:00,750 --> 01:39:02,370
You would have never noticed, brother.

3069
01:39:02,610 --> 01:39:04,370
Yes, I would have.

3070
01:39:04,370 --> 01:39:06,610
If I looked right, I would have seen it.

3071
01:39:06,810 --> 01:39:07,350
No, you'd never have noticed.

3072
01:39:07,350 --> 01:39:09,110
You never pay attention to brother anymore.

3073
01:39:09,210 --> 01:39:10,390
You never pay attention to him.

3074
01:39:10,650 --> 01:39:14,110
You were the one that was supposed to look after him when he got shot.

3075
01:39:14,750 --> 01:39:15,150
You were the one that was supposed to look after him when he got shot.

3076
01:39:15,150 --> 01:39:15,810
I can't.

3077
01:39:15,930 --> 01:39:16,550
You know what?

3078
01:39:16,710 --> 01:39:18,370
I think you were the one who shot him.

3079
01:39:18,530 --> 01:39:19,590
You're the one who shot him.

3080
01:39:19,590 --> 01:39:20,450
You play Apex.

3081
01:39:20,610 --> 01:39:22,490
You knew I was going to the supermarket for mom.

3082
01:39:22,490 --> 01:39:26,390
You knew I was going to the supermarket for mom to buy us groceries.

3083
01:39:26,970 --> 01:39:27,690
You knew.

3084
01:39:29,870 --> 01:39:32,090
I think there's actually no anomaly.

3085
01:39:32,550 --> 01:39:35,330
Brother was in your care when this happened.

3086
01:39:35,610 --> 01:39:37,850
That was trapped in the haunted hospital.

3087
01:39:38,450 --> 01:39:40,010
We only call him brother.

3088
01:39:40,150 --> 01:39:40,650
We only call him brother.

3089
01:39:40,650 --> 01:39:42,170
He doesn't even have a name.

3090
01:39:42,450 --> 01:39:43,510
He doesn't even have a name.

3091
01:39:43,910 --> 01:39:44,490
Brother.

3092
01:39:46,750 --> 01:39:48,550
It's because he can only say brother.

3093
01:39:48,670 --> 01:39:49,990
So we named him brother.

3094
01:39:50,630 --> 01:39:51,690
He's like a Pokemon.

3095
01:39:52,490 --> 01:39:53,630
He's like go brother go.

3096
01:39:53,790 --> 01:39:54,230
Brother.

3097
01:39:54,390 --> 01:39:54,790
Brother.

3098
01:39:58,790 --> 01:40:00,170
There's no anomalies right?

3099
01:40:00,310 --> 01:40:01,750
I don't think so.

3100
01:40:03,290 --> 01:40:03,910
Yeah.

3101
01:40:05,390 --> 01:40:07,990
It's like the Sean situation all over again.

3102
01:40:08,270 --> 01:40:08,890
Sean.

3103
01:40:10,090 --> 01:40:10,710
Sean.

3104
01:40:11,830 --> 01:40:13,510
Press F to brother.

3105
01:40:14,220 --> 01:40:16,750
Are we about to go into the SCP world?

3106
01:40:16,990 --> 01:40:17,770
SCP time.

3107
01:40:18,290 --> 01:40:18,890
Oh god.

3108
01:40:19,270 --> 01:40:19,890
2017.

3109
01:40:20,530 --> 01:40:21,710
We fucked up.

3110
01:40:23,790 --> 01:40:24,290
Brother.

3111
01:40:24,590 --> 01:40:25,890
This is your fault.

3112
01:40:27,530 --> 01:40:28,030
No.

3113
01:40:28,330 --> 01:40:28,830
Back.

3114
01:40:31,940 --> 01:40:32,300
Hold on.

3115
01:40:32,460 --> 01:40:32,460
Hold on.

3116
01:40:32,580 --> 01:40:33,600
16 floors again.

3117
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:35,560
No no no no no.

3118
01:40:35,560 --> 01:40:37,460
What if it goes back to like 100?

3119
01:40:38,680 --> 01:40:40,140
We can just go back up again.

3120
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:42,120
What does it go up?

3121
01:40:42,460 --> 01:40:42,960
Oh.

3122
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:46,760
What did you do?

3123
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:47,640
I.

3124
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:50,040
What did you do?

3125
01:40:51,180 --> 01:40:51,680
Okay.

3126
01:40:51,680 --> 01:40:52,780
I.

3127
01:40:54,200 --> 01:40:55,240
I don't know.

3128
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:57,780
When an elevator just gives us question marks.

3129
01:40:57,820 --> 01:40:59,740
I don't think that's a good sign.

3130
01:41:00,460 --> 01:41:01,640
Okay you go brother.

3131
01:41:01,700 --> 01:41:01,980
Wait.

3132
01:41:01,980 --> 01:41:04,560
The elevator doors closed on the other end.

3133
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:04,860
Yeah.

3134
01:41:08,850 --> 01:41:10,010
What did you do?

3135
01:41:10,610 --> 01:41:11,290
I'm going.

3136
01:41:11,690 --> 01:41:13,510
Why is the elevator closed?

3137
01:41:14,430 --> 01:41:14,850
I don't know.

3138
01:41:16,010 --> 01:41:16,570
Brother.

3139
01:41:16,910 --> 01:41:19,230
Brother what did you do?

3140
01:41:19,450 --> 01:41:20,590
Brother what did you do brother?

3141
01:41:20,590 --> 01:41:20,770
Brother.

3142
01:41:21,950 --> 01:41:23,950
Why are you not going inside brother?

3143
01:41:25,650 --> 01:41:26,990
I don't see anything in here.

3144
01:41:27,250 --> 01:41:28,510
Is it like patient zero?

3145
01:41:28,650 --> 01:41:29,930
Are we back to zero floor?

3146
01:41:30,510 --> 01:41:31,250
Is that it?

3147
01:41:31,730 --> 01:41:33,370
Someone said we're checking your mistake.

3148
01:41:34,210 --> 01:41:34,530
Oh.

3149
01:41:36,470 --> 01:41:37,790
This is the test floor.

3150
01:41:37,990 --> 01:41:39,010
This is the test floor.

3151
01:41:40,530 --> 01:41:41,130
Wait no.

3152
01:41:42,510 --> 01:41:43,390
The scale?

3153
01:41:43,610 --> 01:41:45,190
The scale was never here before right?

3154
01:41:46,190 --> 01:41:47,190
I thought it was.

3155
01:41:48,190 --> 01:41:49,410
I even looked at it.

3156
01:41:49,510 --> 01:41:50,210
You can review the floor.

3157
01:41:50,590 --> 01:41:51,370
This is the test floor.

3158
01:41:51,570 --> 01:41:53,530
Oh wait or like the floor that we messed up?

3159
01:41:53,650 --> 01:41:56,310
Yeah I think this is the floor we were just at that we messed up.

3160
01:41:56,630 --> 01:41:56,750
Oh.

3161
01:41:58,530 --> 01:41:59,970
What did we mess up on?

3162
01:42:00,230 --> 01:42:01,410
Everything looks...

3163
01:42:02,250 --> 01:42:03,550
Oh it was.

3164
01:42:03,630 --> 01:42:05,190
The scale was never there.

3165
01:42:05,950 --> 01:42:06,390
What?

3166
01:42:06,830 --> 01:42:07,870
Oh no.

3167
01:42:08,050 --> 01:42:09,150
No I found it.

3168
01:42:09,250 --> 01:42:09,650
I found it.

3169
01:42:09,850 --> 01:42:10,290
Oh.

3170
01:42:12,070 --> 01:42:13,750
They're sad at our mistakes.

3171
01:42:14,770 --> 01:42:16,510
Yo this is so messed up.

3172
01:42:16,530 --> 01:42:17,570
That's so messed up.

3173
01:42:17,650 --> 01:42:18,770
We have to do six.

3174
01:42:20,590 --> 01:42:22,690
I think it's a fast speedrun because they're all in the same room.

3175
01:42:22,770 --> 01:42:23,530
It's always in that room.

3176
01:42:23,850 --> 01:42:24,470
That's true.

3177
01:42:24,610 --> 01:42:25,810
Yeah we can do this.

3178
01:42:25,990 --> 01:42:29,230
We can still get into speedrun.com.

3179
01:42:29,950 --> 01:42:30,670
Oh okay.

3180
01:42:30,670 --> 01:42:31,870
We just spammed it.

3181
01:42:32,110 --> 01:42:32,510
200.

3182
01:42:32,830 --> 01:42:33,030
Okay.

3183
01:42:33,290 --> 01:42:33,690
Go.

3184
01:42:34,650 --> 01:42:35,050
200.

3185
01:42:35,550 --> 01:42:35,950
We got it.

3186
01:42:35,950 --> 01:42:36,270
We got it.

3187
01:42:36,310 --> 01:42:36,670
Speedrun.

3188
01:42:36,950 --> 01:42:38,210
My screen went black.

3189
01:42:38,550 --> 01:42:39,670
Oh no wait can you see anything?

3190
01:42:40,110 --> 01:42:40,870
Yeah I can now.

3191
01:42:41,010 --> 01:42:43,130
Is there anything in there?

3192
01:42:43,570 --> 01:42:45,530
Do you think it's gonna be the same stuff as before?

3193
01:42:45,530 --> 01:42:47,310
I feel like it's just randomized.

3194
01:42:48,530 --> 01:42:49,050
Alright.

3195
01:42:49,290 --> 01:42:50,750
Well that means we know what to look for right?

3196
01:42:51,110 --> 01:42:51,630
Yeah.

3197
01:42:52,510 --> 01:42:54,170
We've seen majority of it.

3198
01:42:54,270 --> 01:42:54,930
We've seen all 16.

3199
01:42:55,070 --> 01:42:56,630
Yeah we should know what to do.

3200
01:42:56,850 --> 01:42:57,490
Yeah right.

3201
01:42:57,810 --> 01:42:59,510
Alright so next floor.

3202
01:43:00,270 --> 01:43:02,690
Oh 200 is always the test floor.

3203
01:43:02,770 --> 01:43:03,310
Remember that.

3204
01:43:03,550 --> 01:43:04,490
Oh you're right.

3205
01:43:04,490 --> 01:43:05,210
So there's nothing here.

3206
01:43:07,570 --> 01:43:11,570
We're sorry we fucked up so we reverted time.

3207
01:43:11,850 --> 01:43:12,850
Oh my god.

3208
01:43:13,790 --> 01:43:14,870
Brother we're sorry.

3209
01:43:15,090 --> 01:43:15,750
We messed up.

3210
01:43:16,990 --> 01:43:18,510
Oh don't push me in.

3211
01:43:19,330 --> 01:43:20,570
What floor is it?

3212
01:43:20,970 --> 01:43:21,850
It's the saw.

3213
01:43:22,310 --> 01:43:23,510
Oh you looked up?

3214
01:43:23,830 --> 01:43:24,830
Yeah I looked up.

3215
01:43:24,990 --> 01:43:25,930
I wasn't a gamer.

3216
01:43:27,790 --> 01:43:28,770
Alright brother.

3217
01:43:30,950 --> 01:43:31,730
Alright brother.

3218
01:43:32,030 --> 01:43:33,310
We're going to get you out of here brother.

3219
01:43:33,850 --> 01:43:35,370
We're gonna get you out brother.

3220
01:43:35,650 --> 01:43:36,750
Brother is possessed.

3221
01:43:39,470 --> 01:43:40,510
Speedrun speedrun.

3222
01:43:42,850 --> 01:43:44,350
No why is it 16?

3223
01:43:44,490 --> 01:43:47,410
I can't believe on the last floor we fucked up.

3224
01:43:47,950 --> 01:43:48,270
I know right.

3225
01:43:48,370 --> 01:43:50,090
On the last fucking floor.

3226
01:43:50,130 --> 01:43:52,590
That means we have to check the behind the thing every time.

3227
01:43:52,590 --> 01:43:52,890
Yeah.

3228
01:43:53,230 --> 01:43:55,270
Oh the guy is in the locker.

3229
01:43:55,710 --> 01:43:59,110
Maybe they'll give all of them to us.

3230
01:43:59,350 --> 01:44:01,270
Maybe all 16 is just anomalies.

3231
01:44:02,270 --> 01:44:04,870
I can't believe we know every single anomaly now.

3232
01:44:06,270 --> 01:44:08,930
I mean it's easy cause it's like always in that room too.

3233
01:44:09,130 --> 01:44:10,410
Where's the replay ability?

3234
01:44:12,030 --> 01:44:12,550
Uh.

3235
01:44:12,850 --> 01:44:13,910
Oh oh oh oh.

3236
01:44:15,490 --> 01:44:18,010
Go go go go go.

3237
01:44:18,250 --> 01:44:18,830
Go go go go go.

3238
01:44:18,830 --> 01:44:19,590
Go go go go go.

3239
01:44:20,810 --> 01:44:21,210
Yay!!!

3240
01:44:22,910 --> 01:44:24,670
Wait wasn't one of them a girl?

3241
01:44:25,690 --> 01:44:26,810
That like shows up.

3242
01:44:26,930 --> 01:44:27,610
Oh the body bag.

3243
01:44:27,850 --> 01:44:28,990
Oh the body bag.

3244
01:44:29,190 --> 01:44:30,810
I know where it starts at though.

3245
01:44:30,950 --> 01:44:31,690
I know where it starts at.

3246
01:44:32,010 --> 01:44:33,730
The x-rays are upside down.

3247
01:44:34,810 --> 01:44:36,350
I'll be the elevator pusher.

3248
01:44:36,610 --> 01:44:37,810
Okay you're not gonna be.

3249
01:44:38,130 --> 01:44:39,130
Okay we'll take turns.

3250
01:44:39,310 --> 01:44:39,910
We'll take turns.

3251
01:44:39,950 --> 01:44:40,370
You go next.

3252
01:44:40,390 --> 01:44:41,110
Why do you think we take turns?

3253
01:44:41,190 --> 01:44:41,910
You're faster.

3254
01:44:42,850 --> 01:44:43,190
No, no, no!

3255
01:44:43,490 --> 01:44:46,970
I think you're really good at this.

3256
01:44:47,390 --> 01:44:49,510
Okay, now you go and I'll press the button.

3257
01:44:50,310 --> 01:44:51,630
What if I mess up?

3258
01:44:52,130 --> 01:44:52,690
Just go.

3259
01:44:53,570 --> 01:44:54,710
Go hurry up!

3260
01:44:55,530 --> 01:44:56,770
I run in there!

3261
01:44:59,930 --> 01:45:01,770
Oh my god, why are you so slow?

3262
01:45:01,830 --> 01:45:02,890
You know what everything is.

3263
01:45:03,370 --> 01:45:04,310
You're gonna make me do this!

3264
01:45:05,630 --> 01:45:08,750
If you're gonna make me do this, I'm gonna do it my way.

3265
01:45:08,770 --> 01:45:09,710
Check behind the whiteboard.

3266
01:45:12,190 --> 01:45:14,410
No, there's nothing behind the whiteboard.

3267
01:45:14,510 --> 01:45:15,430
I don't trust you.

3268
01:45:15,670 --> 01:45:18,130
Oh, yeah, you don't trust me!

3269
01:45:18,370 --> 01:45:19,150
Look at that!

3270
01:45:19,190 --> 01:45:21,490
You don't even trust me to do your job!

3271
01:45:25,750 --> 01:45:26,190
See?

3272
01:45:26,190 --> 01:45:27,790
At least I'm meticulous.

3273
01:45:27,990 --> 01:45:29,230
I look at these details.

3274
01:45:29,670 --> 01:45:30,450
Oh yeah, we gotta go to the other side, right?

3275
01:45:30,450 --> 01:45:30,710
Yeah, see?

3276
01:45:32,170 --> 01:45:33,430
I was testing you.

3277
01:45:33,530 --> 01:45:35,230
I was testing to see if you remember.

3278
01:45:39,970 --> 01:45:42,790
Oh, that sucks because now we have to run all the way to the other side.

3279
01:45:43,130 --> 01:45:43,410
I know.

3280
01:45:44,350 --> 01:45:45,710
Yeah, because what if there's an anomaly?

3281
01:45:48,890 --> 01:45:49,310
207!

3282
01:45:49,510 --> 01:45:49,810
Seven!

3283
01:45:50,770 --> 01:45:51,830
Don't worry, I'll be here.

3284
01:45:52,070 --> 01:45:53,230
What if it's the body bag?

3285
01:45:53,510 --> 01:45:53,930
Wait!

3286
01:45:54,550 --> 01:45:55,610
Why am I going?

3287
01:45:56,010 --> 01:45:57,170
Because then we know if there's an anomaly.

3288
01:45:58,350 --> 01:45:58,770
Okay.

3289
01:45:59,210 --> 01:46:00,630
It is a very far run.

3290
01:46:01,850 --> 01:46:03,270
It is a pretty far run.

3291
01:46:03,350 --> 01:46:04,930
I'm scared of being in here.

3292
01:46:05,810 --> 01:46:07,090
You're peeing in here?

3293
01:46:07,970 --> 01:46:09,050
Being in here?

3294
01:46:10,930 --> 01:46:11,330
Yeah.

3295
01:46:11,330 --> 01:46:13,390
Wait, I think we're good actually.

3296
01:46:13,550 --> 01:46:14,610
Oh no, that's the QR code!

3297
01:46:14,710 --> 01:46:15,250
It's the QR code.

3298
01:46:15,270 --> 01:46:15,910
Oh, it's the QR code?

3299
01:46:16,110 --> 01:46:16,930
The guy who's trapped?

3300
01:46:17,070 --> 01:46:17,570
See, look.

3301
01:46:17,770 --> 01:46:20,470
It would be a waste of time if I ran in there too.

3302
01:46:24,550 --> 01:46:25,710
Get out of my way.

3303
01:46:27,330 --> 01:46:28,570
How did you know?

3304
01:46:31,270 --> 01:46:33,150
I said being, you guys!

3305
01:46:33,270 --> 01:46:34,930
It's Doki that brought up the pee!

3306
01:46:35,010 --> 01:46:35,650
I can't believe it!

3307
01:46:35,790 --> 01:46:38,050
Why do you always bring up the pee?

3308
01:46:38,490 --> 01:46:38,990
You go.

3309
01:46:39,090 --> 01:46:39,190
You go.

3310
01:46:39,710 --> 01:46:40,450
Why me?

3311
01:46:40,610 --> 01:46:41,090
Run!

3312
01:46:41,310 --> 01:46:42,870
Because we're taking turns!

3313
01:46:44,130 --> 01:46:45,710
I did not agree to that.

3314
01:46:45,990 --> 01:46:47,150
I hope it's the body bag.

3315
01:46:47,890 --> 01:46:50,110
If it's the body bag, we have to do this all over again.

3316
01:46:50,610 --> 01:46:51,550
No we don't!

3317
01:46:51,770 --> 01:46:52,870
You just run over here.

3318
01:46:53,190 --> 01:46:53,790
Get in there!

3319
01:46:53,790 --> 01:46:54,550
What if I die?

3320
01:46:55,250 --> 01:46:55,970
Go inside!

3321
01:46:57,510 --> 01:46:59,150
Oh, it's the sad face.

3322
01:46:59,390 --> 01:46:59,850
He's sad.

3323
01:47:00,090 --> 01:47:00,510
Oh, okay.

3324
01:47:00,630 --> 01:47:00,950
Sad face.

3325
01:47:00,950 --> 01:47:02,110
Yeah, he learned it was terminal.

3326
01:47:03,190 --> 01:47:06,210
So we have to get a specialist.

3327
01:47:06,650 --> 01:47:08,370
One of us is going to get the body bag.

3328
01:47:08,370 --> 01:47:10,090
It's going to be really unfortunate.

3329
01:47:10,130 --> 01:47:12,310
It's like Russian roulette, but with a body bag.

3330
01:47:12,970 --> 01:47:13,030
It really is.

3331
01:47:16,590 --> 01:47:17,530
It's your turn.

3332
01:47:18,130 --> 01:47:20,070
Did you get the body bag?

3333
01:47:20,310 --> 01:47:21,690
I sure hope not.

3334
01:47:26,130 --> 01:47:28,970
I know where it's at though in the beginning, so...

3335
01:47:28,970 --> 01:47:30,150
It's not fair!

3336
01:47:30,750 --> 01:47:31,890
Wait, that's not fair!

3337
01:47:32,030 --> 01:47:32,870
You know where it's at!

3338
01:47:34,090 --> 01:47:35,290
I'm not going to tell you either.

3339
01:47:35,390 --> 01:47:35,710
Wait a second.

3340
01:47:36,110 --> 01:47:36,530
What?

3341
01:47:36,530 --> 01:47:36,650
What?

3342
01:47:36,730 --> 01:47:37,290
I'm not going to tell you.

3343
01:47:37,290 --> 01:47:37,850
Are you sure it's not the child?

3344
01:47:38,210 --> 01:47:40,430
I'm not the child.

3345
01:47:40,590 --> 01:47:41,650
I don't see anything, actually.

3346
01:47:41,970 --> 01:47:42,370
Oh, okay.

3347
01:47:42,970 --> 01:47:44,530
Check behind the whiteboard.

3348
01:47:45,070 --> 01:47:45,550
I did.

3349
01:47:45,790 --> 01:47:45,990
Okay.

3350
01:47:47,350 --> 01:47:48,550
Are you sure?

3351
01:47:49,330 --> 01:47:50,570
I don't think it's anything.

3352
01:47:50,810 --> 01:47:51,570
Yeah, it seems good.

3353
01:47:51,910 --> 01:47:52,390
Let's go.

3354
01:47:52,630 --> 01:47:54,210
If we fuck up, we know who to blame.

3355
01:47:56,210 --> 01:47:57,250
You could have checked.

3356
01:47:57,490 --> 01:48:00,970
You literally could have taken the two seconds to go in there.

3357
01:48:00,990 --> 01:48:01,370
I trust you.

3358
01:48:01,370 --> 01:48:03,290
I don't doubt you like you did to me.

3359
01:48:05,590 --> 01:48:06,510
I'm sure you know who to blame.

3360
01:48:06,530 --> 01:48:07,170
I'm going in.

3361
01:48:07,170 --> 01:48:08,010
Your turn.

3362
01:48:08,190 --> 01:48:08,890
Alright, my turn.

3363
01:48:10,070 --> 01:48:10,890
Go in.

3364
01:48:10,930 --> 01:48:11,370
Go inside.

3365
01:48:11,710 --> 01:48:12,290
Go inside.

3366
01:48:12,610 --> 01:48:13,190
Go inside.

3367
01:48:15,390 --> 01:48:16,530
I'm going in.

3368
01:48:18,230 --> 01:48:18,750
Nope.

3369
01:48:19,090 --> 01:48:20,250
There's nothing there.

3370
01:48:20,730 --> 01:48:21,990
Behind the whiteboard?

3371
01:48:22,250 --> 01:48:23,210
I checked the whiteboard.

3372
01:48:23,610 --> 01:48:24,710
Check for the 666?

3373
01:48:24,870 --> 01:48:25,590
I checked the 666.

3374
01:48:25,590 --> 01:48:26,190
You will never get out.

3375
01:48:26,550 --> 01:48:27,590
There's nothing here.

3376
01:48:28,370 --> 01:48:29,290
Are you sure?

3377
01:48:29,590 --> 01:48:31,250
Oh, you don't trust me again?

3378
01:48:31,810 --> 01:48:33,030
There's no baby face?

3379
01:48:33,190 --> 01:48:33,810
No baby face.

3380
01:48:33,870 --> 01:48:35,950
Oh, you're coming inside the room too?

3381
01:48:38,610 --> 01:48:41,370
I mean, well, I'm right next to it.

3382
01:48:41,570 --> 01:48:41,930
Wow.

3383
01:48:42,130 --> 01:48:44,850
You don't even trust me.

3384
01:48:45,330 --> 01:48:46,610
No, I don't.

3385
01:48:46,750 --> 01:48:50,770
I gave like full commitment to all your sources.

3386
01:48:50,970 --> 01:48:53,210
I was like, yep, you said there's nothing in there.

3387
01:48:53,410 --> 01:48:55,430
Alright, I don't even need to check.

3388
01:48:55,870 --> 01:48:59,550
Okay, because it's so long, I'm going to be on the far side of the room.

3389
01:48:59,610 --> 01:49:00,970
I think we should go in the next one together.

3390
01:49:01,410 --> 01:49:02,270
Alright, you know what?

3391
01:49:02,410 --> 01:49:03,610
Let's... yeah, I agree with that.

3392
01:49:03,810 --> 01:49:05,250
Yeah, we'll go in the next one together.

3393
01:49:05,290 --> 01:49:06,050
We'll do that together.

3394
01:49:06,530 --> 01:49:08,470
See guys, this is what friendship is.

3395
01:49:08,490 --> 01:49:09,210
This is teamwork.

3396
01:49:09,370 --> 01:49:10,410
This is teamwork.

3397
01:49:10,450 --> 01:49:11,470
This is stream work.

3398
01:49:12,570 --> 01:49:13,010
Alright.

3399
01:49:13,390 --> 01:49:14,530
Okay, let's go.

3400
01:49:14,710 --> 01:49:15,010
Alright.

3401
01:49:15,270 --> 01:49:16,730
I'm right beside you.

3402
01:49:16,950 --> 01:49:18,010
Okay, I'm just... I'm just...

3403
01:49:18,950 --> 01:49:20,450
Hey, why are you looking back?

3404
01:49:20,490 --> 01:49:21,050
Why are you looking back?

3405
01:49:21,090 --> 01:49:22,610
If you fully trust me, you wouldn't look back.

3406
01:49:23,130 --> 01:49:23,510
Oh!

3407
01:49:26,570 --> 01:49:27,010
Okay.

3408
01:49:30,630 --> 01:49:33,510
We gotta give brother his privacy, you know?

3409
01:49:33,510 --> 01:49:35,190
We gotta give him his privacy.

3410
01:49:35,210 --> 01:49:36,510
He's getting operated on.

3411
01:49:36,510 --> 01:49:38,090
He's getting operated on, you guys.

3412
01:49:38,110 --> 01:49:38,570
It's so rude to go in there.

3413
01:49:38,570 --> 01:49:38,590
Yeah, guys.

3414
01:49:38,630 --> 01:49:40,110
He's like naked right now.

3415
01:49:40,350 --> 01:49:41,510
Our brothers won't look...

3416
01:49:42,630 --> 01:49:43,550
Okay, let's go again.

3417
01:49:43,970 --> 01:49:44,330
Together.

3418
01:49:44,930 --> 01:49:45,290
Together.

3419
01:49:46,030 --> 01:49:46,390
Together.

3420
01:49:46,650 --> 01:49:46,910
Together.

3421
01:49:46,970 --> 01:49:48,290
Why do you keep looking back?

3422
01:49:48,330 --> 01:49:49,730
I think it's the body bag.

3423
01:49:49,770 --> 01:49:50,090
What are you...

3424
01:49:50,090 --> 01:49:51,010
I think it's the body bag.

3425
01:49:51,230 --> 01:49:52,330
I think it's the body bag.

3426
01:49:52,690 --> 01:49:53,710
I think it's the body bag.

3427
01:49:54,650 --> 01:49:55,550
It's not the body bag.

3428
01:49:55,570 --> 01:49:56,250
It's not the body bag.

3429
01:49:56,670 --> 01:49:57,030
It's not the body bag.

3430
01:49:58,870 --> 01:49:59,630
There's no child.

3431
01:50:01,070 --> 01:50:03,470
I hope it's nothing so that we can get closer to the room.

3432
01:50:03,570 --> 01:50:04,510
Yeah, me too.

3433
01:50:04,870 --> 01:50:06,010
I don't think there is anything.

3434
01:50:06,530 --> 01:50:07,670
I don't see anything either.

3435
01:50:08,030 --> 01:50:08,390
Yeah.

3436
01:50:08,750 --> 01:50:09,630
I looked up.

3437
01:50:10,910 --> 01:50:11,270
Oh.

3438
01:50:11,530 --> 01:50:11,890
Whoa.

3439
01:50:12,070 --> 01:50:12,770
Thanks for the raid.

3440
01:50:12,910 --> 01:50:13,830
I don't know who raided me.

3441
01:50:14,710 --> 01:50:15,070
Brother?

3442
01:50:17,950 --> 01:50:18,670
Thank you.

3443
01:50:18,710 --> 01:50:19,190
Thank you.

3444
01:50:19,230 --> 01:50:19,510
Thank you.

3445
01:50:19,610 --> 01:50:20,030
All right.

3446
01:50:20,070 --> 01:50:20,930
I'm going backwards.

3447
01:50:21,570 --> 01:50:22,490
I think we're good.

3448
01:50:22,770 --> 01:50:23,610
I think we're good.

3449
01:50:23,890 --> 01:50:24,570
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3450
01:50:24,870 --> 01:50:25,230
Brother?

3451
01:50:25,550 --> 01:50:25,890
Brother?

3452
01:50:26,270 --> 01:50:26,990
Don't worry, brother.

3453
01:50:27,070 --> 01:50:29,590
We're gonna make it to the 300th floor.

3454
01:50:31,590 --> 01:50:31,950
Yay.

3455
01:50:34,410 --> 01:50:35,130
Oh, Blaze.

3456
01:50:35,630 --> 01:50:35,990
Thanks.

3457
01:50:35,990 --> 01:50:36,150
Thank you.

3458
01:50:36,490 --> 01:50:36,970
213.

3459
01:50:37,870 --> 01:50:38,350
213.

3460
01:50:38,870 --> 01:50:40,150
Now we took turns again.

3461
01:50:40,930 --> 01:50:41,410
Oh.

3462
01:50:41,410 --> 01:50:42,470
Oh, it's the child face.

3463
01:50:42,590 --> 01:50:43,050
It's the child.

3464
01:50:43,150 --> 01:50:43,350
Okay.

3465
01:50:43,590 --> 01:50:44,290
God damn it.

3466
01:50:49,050 --> 01:50:49,530
Okay.

3467
01:50:49,730 --> 01:50:50,350
All right.

3468
01:50:50,370 --> 01:50:50,650
Good.

3469
01:50:50,650 --> 01:50:51,090
Good turn.

3470
01:50:51,110 --> 01:50:51,550
Together, guys.

3471
01:50:51,810 --> 01:50:52,230
Together.

3472
01:50:52,430 --> 01:50:52,790
No.

3473
01:50:52,790 --> 01:50:53,310
It's all you.

3474
01:50:53,650 --> 01:50:54,390
It's all you.

3475
01:50:55,030 --> 01:50:56,370
What happened to together?

3476
01:50:58,450 --> 01:50:59,370
Go on in.

3477
01:51:02,470 --> 01:51:02,950
There's no body bag.

3478
01:51:03,090 --> 01:51:04,170
There's no body bag.

3479
01:51:04,610 --> 01:51:05,090
There's no body bag.

3480
01:51:05,150 --> 01:51:05,630
There's no body bag.

3481
01:51:05,630 --> 01:51:05,970
There's no body bag.

3482
01:51:06,730 --> 01:51:07,850
Oh, you don't trust me.

3483
01:51:07,890 --> 01:51:08,450
You're everything.

3484
01:51:08,810 --> 01:51:12,290
You go for it.

3485
01:51:12,490 --> 01:51:13,350
It's 666.

3486
01:51:13,690 --> 01:51:14,750
It's the 666.

3487
01:51:15,230 --> 01:51:15,610
It's the 666.

3488
01:51:15,670 --> 01:51:16,110
Yeah.

3489
01:51:16,210 --> 01:51:18,090
I think the next one's the body bag.

3490
01:51:18,090 --> 01:51:20,350
The next one has to be the body bag because we really have to wrap.

3491
01:51:20,350 --> 01:51:21,370
It's your turn.

3492
01:51:21,890 --> 01:51:22,590
Oh my God.

3493
01:51:22,590 --> 01:51:22,910
No.

3494
01:51:23,190 --> 01:51:25,670
It's okay because if it's the body bag, I can see it from here.

3495
01:51:27,270 --> 01:51:28,090
It's your turn.

3496
01:51:28,110 --> 01:51:28,990
I'll let you know immediately.

3497
01:51:29,690 --> 01:51:30,930
I'll be next to the button.

3498
01:51:31,150 --> 01:51:32,150
It's the body bag.

3499
01:51:32,330 --> 01:51:33,310
It's the body bag.

3500
01:51:33,350 --> 01:51:34,030
Oh, my God.

3501
01:51:34,710 --> 01:51:35,150
Oh, my God.

3502
01:51:35,510 --> 01:51:35,950
Oh, my God.

3503
01:51:41,950 --> 01:51:43,930
At least we're on this side, you know?

3504
01:51:44,490 --> 01:51:44,890
Yeah.

3505
01:51:45,350 --> 01:51:45,750
Okay.

3506
01:51:45,750 --> 01:51:47,910
This one has to be the smiley then, right?

3507
01:51:48,010 --> 01:51:48,670
Because we haven't gotten...

3508
01:51:48,670 --> 01:51:49,110
Behind the...

3509
01:51:49,110 --> 01:51:49,470
Yep.

3510
01:51:49,750 --> 01:51:50,290
There it is.

3511
01:51:50,370 --> 01:51:50,670
Oh, my God.

3512
01:51:50,750 --> 01:51:51,570
That's so cheap.

3513
01:51:51,670 --> 01:52:00,050
The last floor with the smiley to make... he must have done it so that the last floor would always be like the smiley face to make you think there's nothing.

3514
01:52:01,150 --> 01:52:01,550
Right?

3515
01:52:01,810 --> 01:52:02,550
SCP time.

3516
01:52:03,470 --> 01:52:03,870
No.

3517
01:52:04,070 --> 01:52:04,470
No.

3518
01:52:04,490 --> 01:52:05,090
It's SCP.

3519
01:52:05,290 --> 01:52:05,690
No.

3520
01:52:05,770 --> 01:52:05,830
No.

3521
01:52:05,830 --> 01:52:05,950
Oh.

3522
01:52:05,970 --> 01:52:06,710
Oh, my God.

3523
01:52:06,710 --> 01:52:07,010
What's happening?

3524
01:52:07,170 --> 01:52:07,550
What's that?

3525
01:52:07,630 --> 01:52:08,230
What is that?

3526
01:52:08,350 --> 01:52:09,010
I can't see anything.

3527
01:52:09,210 --> 01:52:09,810
I can't see anything.

3528
01:52:09,850 --> 01:52:10,210
What is that?

3529
01:52:11,510 --> 01:52:12,330
Oh, it's like...

3530
01:52:12,330 --> 01:52:12,730
What the hell?

3531
01:52:12,930 --> 01:52:13,550
A zombie...

3532
01:52:13,550 --> 01:52:15,030
It's like the Unity Store zombie.

3533
01:52:15,550 --> 01:52:17,470
But there's like a guy blocking the door too.

3534
01:52:17,710 --> 01:52:18,450
There's two of them.

3535
01:52:18,490 --> 01:52:19,070
There's two zombies.

3536
01:52:19,390 --> 01:52:19,710
Okay.

3537
01:52:19,790 --> 01:52:19,990
Wait.

3538
01:52:20,070 --> 01:52:20,810
We got to split up.

3539
01:52:20,950 --> 01:52:21,390
This way.

3540
01:52:21,470 --> 01:52:21,730
This way.

3541
01:52:21,730 --> 01:52:21,970
This way.

3542
01:52:22,050 --> 01:52:22,150
Okay.

3543
01:52:22,230 --> 01:52:23,030
I got the...

3544
01:52:23,030 --> 01:52:23,250
Okay.

3545
01:52:23,270 --> 01:52:24,190
The zombie is chasing me.

3546
01:52:25,290 --> 01:52:26,730
I'll sacrifice myself to you.

3547
01:52:26,730 --> 01:52:27,490
Ah, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

3548
01:52:27,990 --> 01:52:28,710
What do you mean, shit?

3549
01:52:29,130 --> 01:52:30,450
I got started chasing...

3550
01:52:30,450 --> 01:52:31,430
Getting chased by a zombie.

3551
01:52:35,970 --> 01:52:37,030
Man, this is up to you.

3552
01:52:37,710 --> 01:52:39,270
He fucking ran me.

3553
01:52:42,850 --> 01:52:43,810
Oh, my God.

3554
01:52:43,810 --> 01:52:44,890
I can't believe it.

3555
01:52:44,910 --> 01:52:46,730
I can't believe you walking dead me.

3556
01:52:46,810 --> 01:52:48,950
I can't believe you walking dead me.

3557
01:52:49,490 --> 01:52:50,270
What do you mean?

3558
01:52:50,830 --> 01:52:52,990
You let that guy kill me.

3559
01:52:53,330 --> 01:52:55,850
I literally watched him bum rush you.

3560
01:52:56,590 --> 01:52:57,670
Oh, we have a new floor.

3561
01:52:57,850 --> 01:52:58,690
We have a new door.

3562
01:52:58,750 --> 01:52:58,890
We have a new door.

3563
01:52:59,190 --> 01:52:59,870
All right.

3564
01:52:59,930 --> 01:53:00,810
Time to see you.

3565
01:53:00,910 --> 01:53:01,150
Here we go.

3566
01:53:02,230 --> 01:53:04,150
What's all different in this room?

3567
01:53:04,190 --> 01:53:04,410
Okay.

3568
01:53:04,410 --> 01:53:04,530
Oh, my God.

3569
01:53:04,550 --> 01:53:04,890
Okay.

3570
01:53:04,930 --> 01:53:05,470
He's over there.

3571
01:53:05,470 --> 01:53:05,790
This is a...

3572
01:53:05,790 --> 01:53:05,930
This is a...

3573
01:53:05,930 --> 01:53:05,950
Brother.

3574
01:53:05,970 --> 01:53:06,890
He's a doctor now.

3575
01:53:07,110 --> 01:53:07,730
He's a doctor.

3576
01:53:08,070 --> 01:53:08,810
He's at the...

3577
01:53:08,810 --> 01:53:09,510
He's finally...

3578
01:53:09,510 --> 01:53:10,730
He's getting his diagnosis.

3579
01:53:11,570 --> 01:53:12,010
Wait.

3580
01:53:12,090 --> 01:53:12,630
Oh, gosh.

3581
01:53:12,650 --> 01:53:13,710
This is gonna be so bad.

3582
01:53:13,850 --> 01:53:15,830
We have to check behind these curtains.

3583
01:53:15,930 --> 01:53:16,670
Oh, no.

3584
01:53:17,050 --> 01:53:17,750
There's gotta be...

3585
01:53:17,750 --> 01:53:19,310
There has to be somebody behind these.

3586
01:53:19,570 --> 01:53:21,030
There's gonna be something on the computer.

3587
01:53:21,610 --> 01:53:22,990
There's gonna be people behind.

3588
01:53:24,190 --> 01:53:25,070
Oh, God.

3589
01:53:25,350 --> 01:53:25,750
Okay.

3590
01:53:25,810 --> 01:53:25,970
Let's see.

3591
01:53:25,970 --> 01:53:29,250
So, like, he's waiting for the doctor to tell him what the surgery was like.

3592
01:53:29,390 --> 01:53:30,850
If the surgery was a success.

3593
01:53:30,950 --> 01:53:31,610
A success or not.

3594
01:53:31,730 --> 01:53:32,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3595
01:53:32,390 --> 01:53:33,610
It's the operation time.

3596
01:53:34,350 --> 01:53:35,710
Post operation, brother.

3597
01:53:35,710 --> 01:53:36,750
We're here for you.

3598
01:53:36,770 --> 01:53:37,310
Just remember.

3599
01:53:37,770 --> 01:53:38,490
We're holding your hand, brother.

3600
01:53:38,550 --> 01:53:39,370
We're holding your hand.

3601
01:53:39,370 --> 01:53:40,010
We're here for you, brother.

3602
01:53:43,330 --> 01:53:44,310
Washing your hands.

3603
01:53:44,510 --> 01:53:45,710
Drying your hands.

3604
01:53:45,790 --> 01:53:47,470
Isn't that, like, kind of unsanitary?

3605
01:53:47,770 --> 01:53:48,550
The hand dryer.

3606
01:53:48,870 --> 01:53:49,950
The hand dryer next to...

3607
01:53:49,950 --> 01:53:50,110
Yeah.

3608
01:53:50,150 --> 01:53:51,950
I think the hand dryer doesn't do as well.

3609
01:53:52,130 --> 01:53:52,670
But they're trying to...

3610
01:53:52,670 --> 01:53:54,150
Those have, like, so many germs in them.

3611
01:53:54,230 --> 01:53:54,710
That's true.

3612
01:53:55,150 --> 01:53:56,130
And then, like...

3613
01:53:56,130 --> 01:53:56,610
He's pregnant.

3614
01:53:56,730 --> 01:53:57,430
Our brother.

3615
01:53:58,370 --> 01:53:59,630
Congratulations, brother.

3616
01:53:59,870 --> 01:54:00,230
Brother.

3617
01:54:00,450 --> 01:54:02,470
The bullet was actually a baby.

3618
01:54:02,610 --> 01:54:03,050
Baby.

3619
01:54:03,050 --> 01:54:03,270
Ty.

3620
01:54:03,410 --> 01:54:03,850
Ty.

3621
01:54:03,850 --> 01:54:04,290
Ty.

3622
01:54:04,450 --> 01:54:04,890
Ty.

3623
01:54:05,230 --> 01:54:05,670
Ty.

3624
01:54:05,670 --> 01:54:05,690
Ty.

3625
01:54:05,710 --> 01:54:07,890
You're gonna be a mother.

3626
01:54:08,210 --> 01:54:10,270
The first ever throat birth.

3627
01:54:12,850 --> 01:54:14,390
You don't have to care, Paul.

3628
01:54:14,690 --> 01:54:16,330
You cough like a child.

3629
01:54:19,910 --> 01:54:22,890
I just noticed this room is, like, in the middle.

3630
01:54:23,010 --> 01:54:24,610
So no matter what we do...

3631
01:54:24,610 --> 01:54:24,650
Oh, yeah.

3632
01:54:24,650 --> 01:54:25,570
No matter what.

3633
01:54:26,330 --> 01:54:27,850
We have to run over there.

3634
01:54:28,750 --> 01:54:29,270
301.

3635
01:54:29,550 --> 01:54:30,070
Yay!

3636
01:54:30,070 --> 01:54:32,950
I can't believe this is actually 666.

3637
01:54:33,550 --> 01:54:35,130
But it's really, like...

3638
01:54:35,130 --> 01:54:35,630
Oh, my God, brother.

3639
01:54:35,650 --> 01:54:35,690
I'm so sorry.

3640
01:54:35,690 --> 01:54:35,850
I'm so sorry.

3641
01:54:35,850 --> 01:54:36,110
I don't know how they're scared of me.

3642
01:54:36,450 --> 01:54:37,650
It's really, like...

3643
01:54:37,650 --> 01:54:39,170
It's, like, 16 floor is each.

3644
01:54:39,430 --> 01:54:41,910
I think it's 15, technically, cuz the first...

3645
01:54:41,910 --> 01:54:42,030
Oh!

3646
01:54:42,070 --> 01:54:43,130
I see the anomaly...

3647
01:54:43,130 --> 01:54:43,430
Oh!

3648
01:54:44,070 --> 01:54:45,010
What the fuck?

3649
01:54:45,030 --> 01:54:45,550
They're babies!

3650
01:54:46,770 --> 01:54:47,510
Is this what?

3651
01:54:47,530 --> 01:54:48,250
The third baby.

3652
01:54:48,990 --> 01:54:49,510
It's the third baby.

3653
01:54:49,510 --> 01:54:50,050
Oh, my God!

3654
01:54:51,050 --> 01:54:51,850
It's triplets!

3655
01:54:56,610 --> 01:54:57,390
It's actually...

3656
01:54:57,390 --> 01:54:57,650
Oh, my God.

3657
01:54:57,670 --> 01:54:59,010
You're already at the elevator.

3658
01:54:59,270 --> 01:54:59,670
Yeah.

3659
01:54:59,670 --> 01:55:00,950
Because we saw the baby.

3660
01:55:02,030 --> 01:55:02,990
I'm not ready for this.

3661
01:55:03,590 --> 01:55:04,670
Dude, you're not ready to be an uncle?

3662
01:55:04,670 --> 01:55:05,310
One for each of us.

3663
01:55:06,230 --> 01:55:07,690
I'm not ready to be a mom.

3664
01:55:08,230 --> 01:55:09,650
We're uncles now!

3665
01:55:11,630 --> 01:55:12,670
We're uncles!

3666
01:55:13,710 --> 01:55:14,270
Brother.

3667
01:55:14,430 --> 01:55:15,550
I can't believe it!

3668
01:55:16,430 --> 01:55:17,890
Congratulations, brother!

3669
01:55:18,810 --> 01:55:21,910
It's like how triplets are predisposed to...

3670
01:55:21,910 --> 01:55:21,990
Wait, what was that?

3671
01:55:22,610 --> 01:55:23,930
Wait, what was that?

3672
01:55:24,050 --> 01:55:24,470
You heard that?

3673
01:55:24,770 --> 01:55:25,630
Did you hear that?

3674
01:55:25,870 --> 01:55:26,070
Yeah.

3675
01:55:26,350 --> 01:55:27,110
It was like a...

3676
01:55:27,110 --> 01:55:29,570
Check behind.

3677
01:55:29,910 --> 01:55:31,270
What do you mean check?

3678
01:55:31,370 --> 01:55:32,410
I'll go right side.

3679
01:55:33,450 --> 01:55:35,110
Okay, and also go the left side.

3680
01:55:35,190 --> 01:55:35,950
What do you mean also?

3681
01:55:36,050 --> 01:55:37,650
I chose my curtain.

3682
01:55:37,810 --> 01:55:38,990
I chose my curtain.

3683
01:55:39,010 --> 01:55:39,510
It's your turn.

3684
01:55:39,910 --> 01:55:40,830
Rock, paper, scissors.

3685
01:55:42,710 --> 01:55:43,510
Rock, paper...

3686
01:55:48,630 --> 01:55:49,030
Okay.

3687
01:55:49,030 --> 01:55:49,630
Go check.

3688
01:55:51,670 --> 01:55:52,550
Oh, I heard it again.

3689
01:55:52,830 --> 01:55:53,610
I think it is in there.

3690
01:55:54,130 --> 01:55:55,070
Okay, I got an idea.

3691
01:55:55,290 --> 01:55:59,270
I was gonna jump over here and look over the curtain.

3692
01:55:59,710 --> 01:56:00,110
I was gonna jump over here and look over the curtain.

3693
01:56:00,110 --> 01:56:00,110
Together.

3694
01:56:00,950 --> 01:56:01,830
We're all we had.

3695
01:56:03,050 --> 01:56:04,170
This is for you, brother.

3696
01:56:04,290 --> 01:56:05,170
This is for you, brother.

3697
01:56:06,070 --> 01:56:07,470
I think it's saying here.

3698
01:56:08,930 --> 01:56:10,110
Oh, it's like...

3699
01:56:10,110 --> 01:56:11,130
Okay, I'm curious.

3700
01:56:12,110 --> 01:56:12,970
There's nothing here.

3701
01:56:13,510 --> 01:56:14,170
Wait, what?

3702
01:56:14,530 --> 01:56:15,010
Oh.

3703
01:56:15,330 --> 01:56:16,350
It's just going...

3704
01:56:17,130 --> 01:56:18,830
Okay, alright, so we're fine.

3705
01:56:19,110 --> 01:56:21,570
But that has to be anomaly, right?

3706
01:56:21,850 --> 01:56:22,750
Yeah, that's an anomaly.

3707
01:56:23,270 --> 01:56:24,610
Someone said look up.

3708
01:56:25,450 --> 01:56:28,070
Okay, they all always say look up.

3709
01:56:28,650 --> 01:56:29,590
There's nothing up.

3710
01:56:29,590 --> 01:56:30,310
Is it on the computer?

3711
01:56:32,410 --> 01:56:33,570
Oh, I heard another noise too.

3712
01:56:33,790 --> 01:56:36,010
I think it's just the same thing.

3713
01:56:36,230 --> 01:56:37,730
You're just projecting.

3714
01:56:41,390 --> 01:56:42,150
Hey, Dev.

3715
01:56:42,230 --> 01:56:44,150
If you need anybody to make noises for you.

3716
01:56:51,630 --> 01:56:52,890
Thank you for the rain.

3717
01:56:52,890 --> 01:56:54,730
I didn't catch who it was.

3718
01:56:54,770 --> 01:56:55,290
Thank you.

3719
01:56:56,470 --> 01:56:57,690
Alright, where do we go?

3720
01:57:00,750 --> 01:57:01,990
Thank you so much.

3721
01:57:03,750 --> 01:57:05,570
I don't think I see anything.

3722
01:57:06,450 --> 01:57:07,550
I'm checking my...

3723
01:57:07,550 --> 01:57:09,450
You looked for two seconds.

3724
01:57:09,470 --> 01:57:09,830
Oh, wait.

3725
01:57:09,850 --> 01:57:10,990
Was this computer always on?

3726
01:57:11,170 --> 01:57:12,610
Oh, I see something.

3727
01:57:12,870 --> 01:57:13,030
Oh.

3728
01:57:15,410 --> 01:57:15,890
Wow.

3729
01:57:16,670 --> 01:57:17,910
It's kind of... that's a cool effect.

3730
01:57:17,910 --> 01:57:18,230
That's cool.

3731
01:57:18,310 --> 01:57:19,430
That's actually a cool effect.

3732
01:57:19,530 --> 01:57:20,950
Whoa, look at all these eyes.

3733
01:57:21,230 --> 01:57:22,250
Oh, they blink.

3734
01:57:22,510 --> 01:57:24,710
They gave me goosebumps.

3735
01:57:25,330 --> 01:57:26,010
They were blinking.

3736
01:57:27,690 --> 01:57:28,210
I'm having trypophobia.

3737
01:57:30,250 --> 01:57:31,150
Trypophobia warming?

3738
01:57:35,410 --> 01:57:35,970
Alright.

3739
01:57:38,670 --> 01:57:39,230
304!

3740
01:57:41,370 --> 01:57:41,930
304!

3741
01:57:42,610 --> 01:57:43,170
304!

3742
01:57:47,100 --> 01:57:47,360
Alright.

3743
01:57:48,520 --> 01:57:49,080
Please.

3744
01:57:49,900 --> 01:57:51,940
Yeah, go ahead.

3745
01:57:52,020 --> 01:57:52,260
Go ahead.

3746
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:53,240
Go ahead.

3747
01:57:54,540 --> 01:57:55,340
Go ahead.

3748
01:57:55,460 --> 01:57:56,000
Go ahead.

3749
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:56,500
Go ahead.

3750
01:57:56,580 --> 01:57:56,580
Go ahead.

3751
01:58:00,020 --> 01:58:00,900
I'll go right.

3752
01:58:00,980 --> 01:58:01,080
I'll go right side.

3753
01:58:02,080 --> 01:58:03,060
Nothing on the right.

3754
01:58:05,260 --> 01:58:06,180
Nothing here.

3755
01:58:06,420 --> 01:58:08,140
Oh wait, I have an anomaly.

3756
01:58:08,440 --> 01:58:09,180
What's the anomaly?

3757
01:58:09,900 --> 01:58:11,180
They're playing... it's like that...

3758
01:58:11,180 --> 01:58:11,840
Oh, they're playing...

3759
01:58:11,840 --> 01:58:12,940
Maze Escape game.

3760
01:58:13,320 --> 01:58:15,040
Yeah, they're playing this game!

3761
01:58:15,640 --> 01:58:16,520
Wait, is it going to...

3762
01:58:16,520 --> 01:58:16,900
They're going to show us...

3763
01:58:16,900 --> 01:58:18,300
It's going to the room.

3764
01:58:18,640 --> 01:58:19,520
That's our room.

3765
01:58:19,780 --> 01:58:20,440
Wait, uh oh.

3766
01:58:20,500 --> 01:58:21,100
I don't want to see that.

3767
01:58:21,100 --> 01:58:22,440
Wait, are they out here?

3768
01:58:22,920 --> 01:58:24,180
You think there's someone out here?

3769
01:58:24,360 --> 01:58:25,660
No, they're in our room now.

3770
01:58:26,640 --> 01:58:27,840
They're looking at the anomalies.

3771
01:58:28,120 --> 01:58:29,120
Oh, and it stopped.

3772
01:58:29,280 --> 01:58:29,780
The game stopped.

3773
01:58:30,340 --> 01:58:30,920
Oh, okay.

3774
01:58:32,200 --> 01:58:33,780
They're not as gamers as us.

3775
01:58:33,780 --> 01:58:38,060
Yeah, they got too scared and stopped playing the game.

3776
01:58:38,220 --> 01:58:39,100
We're never scared.

3777
01:58:39,160 --> 01:58:40,520
We made it to 305.

3778
01:58:40,640 --> 01:58:44,120
We are the first YouTubers to make it to 305.

3779
01:58:44,440 --> 01:58:45,260
Are we actually?

3780
01:58:47,020 --> 01:58:47,920
What do you think?

3781
01:58:52,520 --> 01:58:55,420
Don't lie on the internet, doggie.

3782
01:58:56,760 --> 01:58:57,320
Don't.

3783
01:58:57,320 --> 01:58:57,740
Don't.

3784
01:58:57,900 --> 01:58:58,800
Here, I'll go right.

3785
01:58:58,880 --> 01:58:59,600
Okay, I'll go left.

3786
01:59:00,440 --> 01:59:01,800
Nope, no anomalies.

3787
01:59:02,440 --> 01:59:03,000
Anomaly.

3788
01:59:03,060 --> 01:59:04,300
There's an anomaly on the computer.

3789
01:59:04,720 --> 01:59:05,620
What is it this time?

3790
01:59:05,760 --> 01:59:06,640
Oh, hey!

3791
01:59:07,860 --> 01:59:09,000
There's like, um...

3792
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:10,040
Insert your OC.

3793
01:59:11,260 --> 01:59:12,840
What are you talking about?

3794
01:59:13,180 --> 01:59:14,840
What are you talking about?

3795
01:59:14,840 --> 01:59:15,440
That could be you.

3796
01:59:15,520 --> 01:59:19,160
Those drawings where you buy art and insert your character here.

3797
01:59:19,460 --> 01:59:21,800
And the black screen is like the character.

3798
01:59:23,080 --> 01:59:23,520
What?

3799
01:59:23,520 --> 01:59:25,240
Did we see the same thing?

3800
01:59:25,360 --> 01:59:26,260
Yeah, I saw it!

3801
01:59:26,340 --> 01:59:28,400
There was like a black character outlining there.

3802
01:59:28,440 --> 01:59:28,840
It's a silhouette!

3803
01:59:29,300 --> 01:59:30,120
Why see each?

3804
01:59:30,140 --> 01:59:31,080
Your character here!

3805
01:59:31,640 --> 01:59:33,160
I didn't see that at all!

3806
01:59:33,440 --> 01:59:34,040
What did you see?

3807
01:59:34,320 --> 01:59:36,040
I think you need to take your mask off.

3808
01:59:36,040 --> 01:59:36,480
What?

3809
01:59:36,560 --> 01:59:38,040
No, I think you need to...

3810
01:59:38,040 --> 01:59:39,960
My chest saw the same thing!

3811
01:59:40,760 --> 01:59:41,580
What do you think?

3812
01:59:41,700 --> 01:59:42,800
Okay, I'll go left.

3813
01:59:43,040 --> 01:59:44,100
No anomalies here.

3814
01:59:44,480 --> 01:59:45,720
No anomalies here.

3815
01:59:46,200 --> 01:59:47,220
Unless you don't...

3816
01:59:47,220 --> 01:59:49,800
Yeah, what the hell is dopey cooking?

3817
01:59:49,800 --> 01:59:50,840
I don't know, man.

3818
01:59:52,160 --> 01:59:52,960
She's overcooking.

3819
01:59:53,520 --> 01:59:54,820
Oh, you don't trust me.

3820
01:59:54,840 --> 01:59:57,680
You're looking at the left side because you didn't even trust me.

3821
01:59:57,800 --> 01:59:58,920
Okay, well look at the right side.

3822
01:59:59,020 --> 02:00:00,780
I think we should both double check our answers.

3823
02:00:00,880 --> 02:00:02,840
Wait, was the needle always this huge?

3824
02:00:03,380 --> 02:00:03,880
What needle?

3825
02:00:04,240 --> 02:00:05,680
I don't think there's ever been a needle.

3826
02:00:07,180 --> 02:00:07,840
Oh, wait!

3827
02:00:08,220 --> 02:00:10,680
Was there always been like the disease...

3828
02:00:10,680 --> 02:00:11,420
History?

3829
02:00:12,280 --> 02:00:13,300
Yeah, with the...

3830
02:00:13,300 --> 02:00:14,820
Wait, maybe we should pay attention to this table.

3831
02:00:14,820 --> 02:00:15,180
Yeah, maybe.

3832
02:00:15,380 --> 02:00:16,620
Yeah, I feel like we should.

3833
02:00:17,040 --> 02:00:18,520
Wait, has there always been a history?

3834
02:00:19,500 --> 02:00:20,880
Has that always been... The history?

3835
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:23,200
History?

3836
02:00:23,720 --> 02:00:24,120
History?

3837
02:00:24,600 --> 02:00:26,060
Okay, it's always been here.

3838
02:00:26,180 --> 02:00:26,420
Okay.

3839
02:00:26,720 --> 02:00:29,180
Okay, it's just...

3840
02:00:29,180 --> 02:00:29,940
Is brother okay?

3841
02:00:30,020 --> 02:00:31,340
This doctor is just illiterate.

3842
02:00:32,620 --> 02:00:33,580
I think we're good.

3843
02:00:33,780 --> 02:00:34,520
I think we're good too.

3844
02:00:34,780 --> 02:00:35,140
Yeah.

3845
02:00:36,040 --> 02:00:36,440
History.

3846
02:00:37,460 --> 02:00:39,420
See, my chat said it was always there.

3847
02:00:39,580 --> 02:00:40,420
Someone said the plant.

3848
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:41,520
What do you mean the plant?

3849
02:00:41,600 --> 02:00:41,940
The plant?

3850
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:43,300
No, the plant has always been that green.

3851
02:00:44,660 --> 02:00:45,060
307!

3852
02:00:46,120 --> 02:00:46,520
Yeah!

3853
02:00:46,760 --> 02:00:47,020
Yeah!

3854
02:00:49,380 --> 02:00:49,780
Bing!

3855
02:00:49,780 --> 02:00:50,180
Bing!

3856
02:00:51,100 --> 02:00:53,460
I hate it when it like pauses after a while.

3857
02:00:53,980 --> 02:00:54,480
I know, right?

3858
02:00:54,580 --> 02:00:55,820
Cause it's just like, what do you mean?

3859
02:00:56,120 --> 02:00:57,140
It's Bing, right?

3860
02:00:58,480 --> 02:00:59,000
Brother?

3861
02:00:59,140 --> 02:00:59,560
Brother?

3862
02:01:00,060 --> 02:01:00,860
Right side?

3863
02:01:01,320 --> 02:01:02,300
Right side, safe.

3864
02:01:02,880 --> 02:01:03,640
Right side?

3865
02:01:04,260 --> 02:01:04,780
Safe.

3866
02:01:05,080 --> 02:01:05,500
Safe.

3867
02:01:06,040 --> 02:01:06,800
Left side?

3868
02:01:07,020 --> 02:01:07,020
Left side?

3869
02:01:08,040 --> 02:01:08,560
Safe.

3870
02:01:09,340 --> 02:01:09,860
Safe.

3871
02:01:10,080 --> 02:01:10,600
History?

3872
02:01:11,600 --> 02:01:12,120
History.

3873
02:01:13,120 --> 02:01:13,640
History.

3874
02:01:15,160 --> 02:01:16,020
Floor, nothing.

3875
02:01:16,700 --> 02:01:17,740
Ceiling, nothing.

3876
02:01:18,200 --> 02:01:18,720
Brother?

3877
02:01:18,800 --> 02:01:19,140
Exit.

3878
02:01:19,840 --> 02:01:20,360
Water.

3879
02:01:21,100 --> 02:01:21,300
Brother?

3880
02:01:21,420 --> 02:01:22,940
Not pregnant anymore.

3881
02:01:23,480 --> 02:01:24,040
Oh!

3882
02:01:26,720 --> 02:01:28,900
He has had the babies.

3883
02:01:28,960 --> 02:01:30,100
He's had the babies.

3884
02:01:30,620 --> 02:01:33,560
It was... it wasn't a bullet all along.

3885
02:01:33,660 --> 02:01:34,600
It was like an egg.

3886
02:01:34,940 --> 02:01:36,160
You are king.

3887
02:01:38,320 --> 02:01:39,920
What happened to the baby?

3888
02:01:40,880 --> 02:01:43,420
They're in the... yeah, they're in the baby ward.

3889
02:01:43,840 --> 02:01:45,060
The baby ward?

3890
02:01:45,160 --> 02:01:45,500
Yeah!

3891
02:01:45,520 --> 02:01:47,200
The ward for all you guys.

3892
02:01:47,360 --> 02:01:47,620
Yeah.

3893
02:01:51,420 --> 02:01:51,820
Alright.

3894
02:01:52,180 --> 02:01:52,860
It's time.

3895
02:01:53,420 --> 02:01:53,820
Brother?

3896
02:01:54,180 --> 02:01:54,940
Still the same.

3897
02:01:55,820 --> 02:01:56,220
Brother?

3898
02:01:57,920 --> 02:01:58,940
Um... Help me.

3899
02:01:59,900 --> 02:02:01,220
Help me, help me.

3900
02:02:01,780 --> 02:02:03,060
Help, I'm going to drown.

3901
02:02:03,280 --> 02:02:03,940
I'm going to die.

3902
02:02:03,980 --> 02:02:04,680
I'm going to drown.

3903
02:02:04,940 --> 02:02:06,100
No worries, it's going to open.

3904
02:02:06,260 --> 02:02:07,140
The door's going to open.

3905
02:02:07,140 --> 02:02:08,260
I'm going to drown, I'm going to die.

3906
02:02:08,280 --> 02:02:09,260
The door is going to open.

3907
02:02:09,340 --> 02:02:09,820
Don't worry.

3908
02:02:10,120 --> 02:02:10,960
It's going to open.

3909
02:02:11,320 --> 02:02:12,940
It's going to open right now.

3910
02:02:13,180 --> 02:02:14,340
I'm going to die, I'm going to die.

3911
02:02:14,340 --> 02:02:15,640
We're gonna die!

3912
02:02:15,720 --> 02:02:17,300
You're doing great sweetie!

3913
02:02:17,480 --> 02:02:18,600
See, I told you.

3914
02:02:20,080 --> 02:02:22,000
She's such an overreactor.

3915
02:02:22,340 --> 02:02:26,440
Those were all my WISPs tears when I don't start the stream.

3916
02:02:27,420 --> 02:02:28,580
She hates us!

3917
02:02:31,760 --> 02:02:34,180
Man, what an overreaction.

3918
02:02:34,320 --> 02:02:36,260
Seeing that she was gonna die.

3919
02:02:36,340 --> 02:02:40,020
You know what, I get those anomalies a lot.

3920
02:02:40,100 --> 02:02:42,000
I think it's because I'm not a big ass baby.

3921
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:42,900
That is not true!

3922
02:02:43,860 --> 02:02:44,680
Look at this!

3923
02:02:45,080 --> 02:02:46,340
Wait, has this always been white?

3924
02:02:46,460 --> 02:02:46,900
The floor?

3925
02:02:47,940 --> 02:02:49,340
It looks whiter than usual.

3926
02:02:49,460 --> 02:02:51,140
Yeah, it looks like extra bright.

3927
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:52,800
Oh, um...

3928
02:02:53,280 --> 02:02:54,580
You might wanna get out of there.

3929
02:02:54,980 --> 02:02:55,380
What?

3930
02:02:55,720 --> 02:02:56,860
What did you see?

3931
02:02:57,900 --> 02:02:58,860
Wait, what did you see?

3932
02:02:59,040 --> 02:02:59,860
Go back in!

3933
02:02:59,980 --> 02:03:02,080
You have to go back in until you find the anomaly.

3934
02:03:02,340 --> 02:03:03,660
No, no, no, I already found it.

3935
02:03:03,780 --> 02:03:04,800
You go in, you go in.

3936
02:03:04,920 --> 02:03:05,260
It's the floor!

3937
02:03:07,400 --> 02:03:07,800
Oh!

3938
02:03:09,940 --> 02:03:11,860
We both have to restart the game!

3939
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:12,740
I'm gonna get crushed!

3940
02:03:19,920 --> 02:03:24,620
So I think the reason why it was whiter was because the ceiling was reflecting.

3941
02:03:24,620 --> 02:03:25,720
The ceiling was closing in.

3942
02:03:25,760 --> 02:03:26,860
It was getting brighter.

3943
02:03:27,500 --> 02:03:30,200
The light was getting closer to the floor.

3944
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,440
We managed to avoid drowning.

3945
02:03:34,880 --> 02:03:35,400
Okay.

3946
02:03:35,560 --> 02:03:36,740
And getting crushed.

3947
02:03:36,860 --> 02:03:38,060
Okay, I went in first already.

3948
02:03:38,160 --> 02:03:38,900
So it's your turn.

3949
02:03:38,900 --> 02:03:40,800
Okay, now it's my turn to go in first.

3950
02:03:41,980 --> 02:03:42,880
Brother, safe.

3951
02:03:43,200 --> 02:03:43,620
Brother.

3952
02:03:43,820 --> 02:03:44,940
Computer, safe.

3953
02:03:45,220 --> 02:03:46,360
Left side, safe.

3954
02:03:46,580 --> 02:03:48,880
Left side, history-m.

3955
02:03:50,240 --> 02:03:50,760
Safe.

3956
02:03:50,820 --> 02:03:51,580
History-m.

3957
02:03:53,140 --> 02:03:54,920
Lights, not crushing us.

3958
02:03:55,320 --> 02:03:57,320
Sink, dijobu.

3959
02:03:57,700 --> 02:04:00,840
Blow dryer, still unhygienic.

3960
02:04:02,360 --> 02:04:03,560
Filled with germs.

3961
02:04:04,820 --> 02:04:06,640
I think... I think we're safe.

3962
02:04:07,100 --> 02:04:08,880
Brother, give us a thumbs up if we're safe.

3963
02:04:09,620 --> 02:04:13,620
And before they insert like one anomaly outside just to fuck with us.

3964
02:04:13,640 --> 02:04:13,760
I know, right?

3965
02:04:13,860 --> 02:04:15,320
I feel like we should still be checking.

3966
02:04:15,420 --> 02:04:18,220
But they didn't last time, so...

3967
02:04:18,220 --> 02:04:18,680
Alright.

3968
02:04:19,460 --> 02:04:20,240
This is it.

3969
02:04:20,800 --> 02:04:21,240
Okay.

3970
02:04:23,340 --> 02:04:23,780
Alright.

3971
02:04:23,780 --> 02:04:24,220
311!

3972
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:25,360
11!

3973
02:04:27,160 --> 02:04:27,600
311!

3974
02:04:30,080 --> 02:04:30,520
Yeah!

3975
02:04:32,220 --> 02:04:34,160
How are hand dryers unhygienic?

3976
02:04:34,200 --> 02:04:35,000
Well, if they're in a bathroom...

3977
02:04:35,560 --> 02:04:36,740
Oh, you go in first this time.

3978
02:04:36,920 --> 02:04:37,160
Alright.

3979
02:04:37,400 --> 02:04:38,880
If they're in a bathroom, they just...

3980
02:04:38,900 --> 02:04:41,520
You just blow all the germs onto your hands.

3981
02:04:41,960 --> 02:04:43,220
Right side, nothing.

3982
02:04:44,020 --> 02:04:45,360
Left side, safe.

3983
02:04:46,700 --> 02:04:47,880
History-m.

3984
02:04:47,960 --> 02:04:48,960
History-m.

3985
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:49,600
PC.

3986
02:04:50,840 --> 02:04:52,100
Ground, nothing.

3987
02:04:52,600 --> 02:04:54,060
Brother, still there.

3988
02:04:54,580 --> 02:04:56,860
Brother, nothing in his brain.

3989
02:04:57,220 --> 02:04:58,480
Nothing going on in there.

3990
02:04:59,640 --> 02:05:01,260
Brother's going through it.

3991
02:05:01,740 --> 02:05:02,080
Wow.

3992
02:05:02,220 --> 02:05:04,080
There's no way there's not an anomaly.

3993
02:05:04,080 --> 02:05:05,520
There's no anomaly still?

3994
02:05:06,400 --> 02:05:08,660
Yeah, the poopy air gets blown around.

3995
02:05:08,920 --> 02:05:09,580
It's disgusting.

3996
02:05:10,100 --> 02:05:11,980
It's like when you're...

3997
02:05:11,980 --> 02:05:14,600
It's like you have to change your toothbrush every couple of months.

3998
02:05:14,920 --> 02:05:15,420
Yeah.

3999
02:05:15,420 --> 02:05:16,080
Because like...

4000
02:05:16,080 --> 02:05:19,400
Yeah, every couple of months you have to change your toothbrush.

4001
02:05:19,740 --> 02:05:21,300
I thought it was more frequent than that.

4002
02:05:21,780 --> 02:05:23,120
Wait, how frequent?

4003
02:05:24,640 --> 02:05:25,460
Wait a minute.

4004
02:05:28,740 --> 02:05:29,680
Wait a minute.

4005
02:05:32,340 --> 02:05:34,620
How frequent is it supposed to be?

4006
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:35,500
Wait a minute.

4007
02:05:37,560 --> 02:05:38,480
Someone said...

4008
02:05:38,480 --> 02:05:40,420
I thought it was like every month or so.

4009
02:05:40,800 --> 02:05:42,480
Someone said three months max.

4010
02:05:42,740 --> 02:05:43,100
Okay.

4011
02:05:43,380 --> 02:05:46,780
I was like, wait you change your toothbrush every month?

4012
02:05:48,200 --> 02:05:50,240
Well, like I've been getting sick a lot.

4013
02:05:50,240 --> 02:05:50,640
How many months?

4014
02:05:50,640 --> 02:05:52,260
So I've been changing it a lot recently.

4015
02:05:52,260 --> 02:05:52,460
Oh, okay.

4016
02:05:54,400 --> 02:05:55,620
Not every year?

4017
02:05:57,080 --> 02:05:58,920
Not every three to four years?

4018
02:06:01,100 --> 02:06:02,200
Alright, Chai, let me...

4019
02:06:02,200 --> 02:06:02,860
It's like a mattress.

4020
02:06:02,980 --> 02:06:04,680
You're just supposed to flip it upside down.

4021
02:06:05,700 --> 02:06:07,180
You're not supposed to get a new mattress.

4022
02:06:07,280 --> 02:06:07,940
You just flip it.

4023
02:06:08,420 --> 02:06:13,120
Okay, for those who don't know why I had to change my toothbrush every couple of months.

4024
02:06:13,280 --> 02:06:16,940
It's because like you know how you're using your bathroom and you're flushing?

4025
02:06:17,440 --> 02:06:17,840
Yeah.

4026
02:06:19,380 --> 02:06:19,780
Yeah.

4027
02:06:20,320 --> 02:06:23,140
If it's all in the same room, you're gonna wanna change...

4028
02:06:23,140 --> 02:06:23,360
Wait.

4029
02:06:23,500 --> 02:06:23,720
Oh!

4030
02:06:24,840 --> 02:06:25,940
Is that alive?

4031
02:06:27,020 --> 02:06:27,760
Hey, hey.

4032
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:28,620
Oh, it's a cat!

4033
02:06:29,980 --> 02:06:31,800
There's one next to you!

4034
02:06:31,800 --> 02:06:32,600
Oh, look!

4035
02:06:32,700 --> 02:06:33,500
Wait, what is happening?

4036
02:06:33,500 --> 02:06:34,240
Oh my god, he's dying.

4037
02:06:37,060 --> 02:06:38,200
There's another one!

4038
02:06:38,320 --> 02:06:39,500
There's another one over here!

4039
02:06:39,800 --> 02:06:40,360
There's a creature in the universe!

4040
02:06:40,920 --> 02:06:42,900
There's one under the couch too!

4041
02:06:43,240 --> 02:06:44,580
Wait, they're all just dying!

4042
02:06:44,800 --> 02:06:45,900
What's going on?

4043
02:06:47,020 --> 02:06:48,220
Dyes of cringe.

4044
02:06:49,240 --> 02:06:53,340
They see us and they're like, no documentary here.

4045
02:06:54,640 --> 02:06:55,920
Dyes of cringe.

4046
02:06:57,040 --> 02:06:59,700
They haven't changed their toothbrush yet.

4047
02:06:59,800 --> 02:07:01,740
They haven't changed their toothbrush yet.

4048
02:07:01,800 --> 02:07:08,100
So yeah, you have to change your toothbrush every couple of months because when you're flushing, you know, stuff goes out.

4049
02:07:08,180 --> 02:07:09,460
You're ingesting that, man.

4050
02:07:09,720 --> 02:07:10,960
That's why you close your mouth.

4051
02:07:11,060 --> 02:07:11,940
Do you open your mouth?

4052
02:07:13,520 --> 02:07:14,240
What do you mean?

4053
02:07:15,700 --> 02:07:18,640
When I brush my teeth, how else do you brush your teeth?

4054
02:07:18,980 --> 02:07:19,320
Oh, okay.

4055
02:07:19,500 --> 02:07:23,540
I thought like, you know, when you're flushing, you like, mouth open and like, ah.

4056
02:07:23,620 --> 02:07:26,220
No, I just mouth open over the seat, you know?

4057
02:07:27,080 --> 02:07:28,280
No, I just mouth open over the seat, you know?

4058
02:07:28,600 --> 02:07:31,360
No, I just mouth open over the seat, you know?

4059
02:07:31,360 --> 02:07:35,580
That's why you gotta change your toothbrush.

4060
02:07:35,740 --> 02:07:35,820
Six!

4061
02:07:36,700 --> 02:07:37,580
Where's the other six?

4062
02:07:38,280 --> 02:07:39,080
Where's the third six?

4063
02:07:39,100 --> 02:07:39,540
You found it?

4064
02:07:39,720 --> 02:07:39,720
Six is here.

4065
02:07:39,720 --> 02:07:40,300
It's over there.

4066
02:07:40,460 --> 02:07:41,200
Six, six, six.

4067
02:07:42,300 --> 02:07:43,600
We're gonna make it!

4068
02:07:48,320 --> 02:07:49,920
Someone's like, wait, you changed your toothbrush?

4069
02:07:51,180 --> 02:07:51,880
Oh no.

4070
02:07:51,960 --> 02:07:54,200
You don't change your toothbrush until the bristles are all frayed?

4071
02:07:54,360 --> 02:07:55,300
What do you mean?

4072
02:07:56,180 --> 02:07:57,620
That's why I don't flush.

4073
02:07:59,700 --> 02:08:00,100
No!

4074
02:08:00,640 --> 02:08:01,040
No!

4075
02:08:01,360 --> 02:08:01,600
No!

4076
02:08:04,040 --> 02:08:04,560
Alright.

4077
02:08:05,040 --> 02:08:05,560
Okay.

4078
02:08:06,260 --> 02:08:07,880
Oh, brother is huge.

4079
02:08:09,180 --> 02:08:10,760
Brother is hitting the gym.

4080
02:08:13,080 --> 02:08:15,060
Bro, I love how we could tell immediately.

4081
02:08:15,360 --> 02:08:15,720
Yeah.

4082
02:08:16,580 --> 02:08:19,100
Brother, we're supposed to be the same size.

4083
02:08:19,460 --> 02:08:22,120
Brother, you can't drink more milk than us.

4084
02:08:22,180 --> 02:08:23,240
Yeah, how can we?

4085
02:08:23,440 --> 02:08:25,540
Yo, he's been doing too much protein shakes.

4086
02:08:27,420 --> 02:08:29,840
Brother, you've been going to the gym without us?

4087
02:08:29,880 --> 02:08:30,620
It's not fair.

4088
02:08:31,360 --> 02:08:32,880
Brother is going to join basketball.

4089
02:08:33,180 --> 02:08:36,180
He's on the hospital basketball team.

4090
02:08:36,380 --> 02:08:36,800
Oh shit, we're almost to 16.

4091
02:08:37,220 --> 02:08:38,040
We're at almost 16.

4092
02:08:38,840 --> 02:08:39,460
Let's go.

4093
02:08:39,600 --> 02:08:40,120
Oh my god.

4094
02:08:41,420 --> 02:08:42,320
He's big.

4095
02:08:43,320 --> 02:08:43,840
Okay.

4096
02:08:43,860 --> 02:08:44,340
Alright.

4097
02:08:47,040 --> 02:08:48,120
Brother's the same height.

4098
02:08:50,180 --> 02:08:51,060
Oh, yeah.

4099
02:08:51,280 --> 02:08:51,800
No.

4100
02:08:52,100 --> 02:08:53,160
Oh, what the hell is that?

4101
02:08:53,340 --> 02:08:54,200
I think it's following you.

4102
02:08:54,340 --> 02:08:55,260
Does it rush over?

4103
02:08:56,720 --> 02:08:58,460
Oh, wait, what is going on?

4104
02:08:58,460 --> 02:08:58,720
Oh.

4105
02:08:58,880 --> 02:09:00,280
Wait, will it stab us?

4106
02:09:00,800 --> 02:09:01,600
I can't.

4107
02:09:01,600 --> 02:09:02,740
Oh, they're growing bigger.

4108
02:09:03,580 --> 02:09:04,400
Oh my god.

4109
02:09:05,860 --> 02:09:06,920
Oh, wait, it's cheesy.

4110
02:09:09,080 --> 02:09:12,280
I think it's babies.

4111
02:09:13,640 --> 02:09:14,200
Galacka.

4112
02:09:15,580 --> 02:09:17,360
It's protecting the babies.

4113
02:09:17,440 --> 02:09:19,860
It's like those, those like, those like bears.

4114
02:09:20,520 --> 02:09:21,500
That was the brother.

4115
02:09:21,820 --> 02:09:22,340
Yeah.

4116
02:09:23,540 --> 02:09:25,000
Alright, last floor.

4117
02:09:25,540 --> 02:09:26,440
Last floor, baby.

4118
02:09:26,440 --> 02:09:27,340
Until we're at 400.

4119
02:09:27,340 --> 02:09:27,740
400.

4120
02:09:28,660 --> 02:09:31,380
All we have to do is, the ones we're at 400...

4121
02:09:31,380 --> 02:09:31,900
Oh, yeah, definitely.

4122
02:09:33,120 --> 02:09:34,260
What do you think is over there?

4123
02:09:34,680 --> 02:09:35,260
Let's look.

4124
02:09:35,700 --> 02:09:36,120
What is it?

4125
02:09:36,600 --> 02:09:37,000
Oh.

4126
02:09:39,140 --> 02:09:40,500
I don't want to die though.

4127
02:09:41,060 --> 02:09:42,400
Let's go closer.

4128
02:09:42,440 --> 02:09:43,640
No, there was nothing behind it.

4129
02:09:44,820 --> 02:09:46,220
Did you really check?

4130
02:09:46,560 --> 02:09:48,520
Did you actually check?

4131
02:09:48,640 --> 02:09:49,780
You don't trust me?

4132
02:09:49,860 --> 02:09:51,460
I trust you.

4133
02:09:51,480 --> 02:09:52,640
I just wanted to be sure if you checked.

4134
02:09:53,300 --> 02:09:54,600
I trust you.

4135
02:09:54,840 --> 02:09:55,880
You don't trust me.

4136
02:09:55,900 --> 02:09:57,320
You always look at what the stuff is.

4137
02:09:57,340 --> 02:09:58,080
I don't know what the stuff I looked at.

4138
02:09:58,200 --> 02:09:59,760
I hope you don't die this time again.

4139
02:09:59,880 --> 02:10:00,380
Oh, yeah.

4140
02:10:00,440 --> 02:10:02,400
Sorry for sacrificing my life for you.

4141
02:10:03,100 --> 02:10:04,460
Wait, what's in here?

4142
02:10:04,640 --> 02:10:05,340
I don't know.

4143
02:10:05,380 --> 02:10:07,460
I just saw like PC monitors in the toilet.

4144
02:10:07,880 --> 02:10:08,320
Wait.

4145
02:10:08,440 --> 02:10:09,760
Oh, we have to open the doors.

4146
02:10:11,180 --> 02:10:11,620
Oh.

4147
02:10:11,740 --> 02:10:12,360
Uh oh.

4148
02:10:12,400 --> 02:10:12,820
Uh oh.

4149
02:10:12,820 --> 02:10:13,220
Uh oh.

4150
02:10:13,220 --> 02:10:13,560
Oh.

4151
02:10:13,600 --> 02:10:13,880
Ah!

4152
02:10:14,400 --> 02:10:15,540
What the fuck?

4153
02:10:17,020 --> 02:10:18,720
That was your door!

4154
02:10:19,320 --> 02:10:21,240
That was your door!

4155
02:10:22,940 --> 02:10:24,360
Wait, but we just restart.

4156
02:10:24,480 --> 02:10:25,000
It's fine.

4157
02:10:25,340 --> 02:10:25,800
Uh oh.

4158
02:10:25,900 --> 02:10:26,320
Sorry.

4159
02:10:28,400 --> 02:10:29,260
Just run away!

4160
02:10:30,080 --> 02:10:31,320
What do you mean?

4161
02:10:32,080 --> 02:10:32,980
Oh, Skippity.

4162
02:10:33,160 --> 02:10:34,120
Hey, Skippity!

4163
02:10:34,520 --> 02:10:35,840
Oh, you missed it.

4164
02:10:35,940 --> 02:10:37,900
This one is empty though.

4165
02:10:39,540 --> 02:10:40,920
I can't believe it.

4166
02:10:40,940 --> 02:10:41,960
The boomer missed it.

4167
02:10:42,160 --> 02:10:42,760
Oh, it's flooding.

4168
02:10:42,960 --> 02:10:43,400
It's flooding.

4169
02:10:43,620 --> 02:10:44,180
Was that you?

4170
02:10:44,520 --> 02:10:45,780
No, that was not me.

4171
02:10:45,980 --> 02:10:46,760
I did not open.

4172
02:10:46,900 --> 02:10:50,240
Why does all the doors you opened end up killing us?

4173
02:10:50,440 --> 02:10:51,220
It's not me!

4174
02:10:51,880 --> 02:10:53,540
What do you mean it's not you?

4175
02:10:53,580 --> 02:10:56,440
You lit every door you opened killing us.

4176
02:10:56,440 --> 02:10:58,160
I am!

4177
02:10:58,780 --> 02:10:59,960
Oh, who's laughing?

4178
02:11:00,420 --> 02:11:02,360
Oh my god, it's not going inside the...

4179
02:11:02,360 --> 02:11:03,020
Oh no.

4180
02:11:03,720 --> 02:11:04,740
Oh no.

4181
02:11:04,880 --> 02:11:06,000
We're gonna drown!

4182
02:11:07,820 --> 02:11:09,420
My toilet's laughing at me.

4183
02:11:09,680 --> 02:11:11,060
My toilet's laughing at me too!

4184
02:11:11,760 --> 02:11:12,840
Oh, I found it!

4185
02:11:12,920 --> 02:11:13,360
I found it!

4186
02:11:13,400 --> 02:11:14,000
Where, where, where?

4187
02:11:15,300 --> 02:11:16,040
Where are you?

4188
02:11:16,860 --> 02:11:17,540
Go in!

4189
02:11:17,720 --> 02:11:18,040
Go in!

4190
02:11:18,040 --> 02:11:18,680
Hurry up!

4191
02:11:18,780 --> 02:11:19,320
Oh shit.

4192
02:11:19,460 --> 02:11:20,120
Oh, I got in.

4193
02:11:22,620 --> 02:11:23,540
Hurry up.

4194
02:11:23,540 --> 02:11:25,400
You don't even say where we're at.

4195
02:11:25,400 --> 02:11:26,800
You say hurry up.

4196
02:11:28,420 --> 02:11:30,920
Thanks for the instructions there, man.

4197
02:11:31,120 --> 02:11:31,560
Thanks for the instructions there, man.

4198
02:11:31,560 --> 02:11:32,560
Wait, is this the same room?

4199
02:11:32,660 --> 02:11:34,200
Oh no, we're in the toilet now.

4200
02:11:34,680 --> 02:11:35,120
Oh, it's a different...

4201
02:11:35,120 --> 02:11:35,120
Oh, toilet.

4202
02:11:35,120 --> 02:11:35,580
Whoa, brother.

4203
02:11:35,880 --> 02:11:36,920
Our brother needs privacy.

4204
02:11:39,200 --> 02:11:39,640
Brother!

4205
02:11:40,040 --> 02:11:40,820
Oh, he's us!

4206
02:11:40,940 --> 02:11:42,460
We're gonna have to check inside every single...

4207
02:11:42,460 --> 02:11:43,100
I don't think so.

4208
02:11:43,160 --> 02:11:44,380
Oh yeah, we have to look through the crevice.

4209
02:11:44,380 --> 02:11:44,880
Oh my god, look at us!

4210
02:11:45,280 --> 02:11:45,640
It's us!

4211
02:11:46,460 --> 02:11:47,340
Family portrait!

4212
02:11:47,620 --> 02:11:49,980
Look at family photo in the bathroom, everybody!

4213
02:11:50,020 --> 02:11:50,100
Look at family photo in the bathroom, everybody!

4214
02:11:50,360 --> 02:11:52,180
Meet and greet in the bathroom!

4215
02:11:52,860 --> 02:11:53,740
Six toilets?

4216
02:11:53,900 --> 02:11:54,820
There's six of everything.

4217
02:11:55,700 --> 02:11:57,360
There's even six sinks!

4218
02:11:57,960 --> 02:12:00,420
Oh my god, and there's six blow dryers!

4219
02:12:01,060 --> 02:12:01,620
Oh my god, and there's six blow dryers!

4220
02:12:02,600 --> 02:12:04,080
Right next to the toilet.

4221
02:12:04,120 --> 02:12:06,880
They're gonna blow that into your hand.

4222
02:12:06,880 --> 02:12:08,260
Brother, do you have enough toilet paper?

4223
02:12:08,280 --> 02:12:11,340
I like how the kids sink is next to the urinal.

4224
02:12:12,140 --> 02:12:13,640
Okay, this one's gotta be easy.

4225
02:12:13,700 --> 02:12:15,020
There's like nothing in here, right guys?

4226
02:12:15,240 --> 02:12:16,040
Yeah, it has to be.

4227
02:12:16,660 --> 02:12:18,520
We can speed run this to 600.

4228
02:12:18,720 --> 02:12:19,680
We can speed run this.

4229
02:12:19,900 --> 02:12:21,680
We're literally so close to the end.

4230
02:12:22,180 --> 02:12:23,200
200 more floors.

4231
02:12:25,420 --> 02:12:27,080
We're like masters now.

4232
02:12:27,700 --> 02:12:28,180
We're like masters now.

4233
02:12:28,180 --> 02:12:28,600
Oh my god.

4234
02:12:29,040 --> 02:12:30,560
We're the masters of the universe.

4235
02:12:31,160 --> 02:12:32,520
I don't know about that.

4236
02:12:32,840 --> 02:12:33,620
What do you mean?

4237
02:12:34,380 --> 02:12:35,800
The mirror will be fun?

4238
02:12:36,260 --> 02:12:37,080
Don't say that.

4239
02:12:37,440 --> 02:12:38,640
How would you know?

4240
02:12:40,960 --> 02:12:41,760
Check the mirror.

4241
02:12:43,080 --> 02:12:43,720
There's blood!

4242
02:12:44,420 --> 02:12:45,700
There's more than just blood!

4243
02:12:46,940 --> 02:12:49,220
Those hands are coming out of the wall.

4244
02:12:49,660 --> 02:12:50,820
It's like a PNG.

4245
02:12:50,820 --> 02:12:53,300
He's holding a PNG of the airmen.

4246
02:12:53,320 --> 02:12:55,900
They're supposed to be like behind the vent.

4247
02:12:56,240 --> 02:12:58,100
Wait, does that mean vents are fake?

4248
02:12:58,220 --> 02:12:59,540
Like they don't lead anyone?

4249
02:12:59,840 --> 02:13:01,020
There's no ventilation?

4250
02:13:01,640 --> 02:13:03,780
There's no ventilation in the bathroom?

4251
02:13:04,420 --> 02:13:06,500
That's not hygienic at all.

4252
02:13:07,240 --> 02:13:07,300
That's not hygienic at all.

4253
02:13:07,960 --> 02:13:09,220
That's not hygienic at all.

4254
02:13:09,300 --> 02:13:09,720
Alright.

4255
02:13:13,240 --> 02:13:15,060
I like how we don't say anything.

4256
02:13:15,240 --> 02:13:16,580
We just turn around.

4257
02:13:17,220 --> 02:13:18,180
We just turn around.

4258
02:13:18,180 --> 02:13:18,760
Just 180.

4259
02:13:19,260 --> 02:13:20,480
I was like, alright, that's it.

4260
02:13:20,820 --> 02:13:21,680
That's an anomaly, right?

4261
02:13:22,040 --> 02:13:23,460
Doki, I have to pee.

4262
02:13:24,580 --> 02:13:26,460
Don't worry, I'll do this for us.

4263
02:13:27,100 --> 02:13:28,020
Don't die in there.

4264
02:13:28,080 --> 02:13:28,740
Just stay there.

4265
02:13:33,820 --> 02:13:35,540
What if I just die?

4266
02:13:36,680 --> 02:13:37,460
Don't die!

4267
02:13:38,060 --> 02:13:39,520
Why are you still here?

4268
02:13:39,960 --> 02:13:40,780
Okay, I'll be right back.

4269
02:13:41,300 --> 02:13:42,640
Hold on, guys.

4270
02:13:42,760 --> 02:13:45,280
We're just waiting to see if I get it.

4271
02:13:47,480 --> 02:13:48,200
Oh, okay.

4272
02:13:48,260 --> 02:13:49,100
There was no anomalies.

4273
02:13:49,480 --> 02:13:51,500
Has there always been three trash cans down here?

4274
02:13:52,580 --> 02:13:53,800
Why is there trash cans?

4275
02:13:53,820 --> 02:13:56,380
I didn't look down, guys.

4276
02:13:57,520 --> 02:13:58,480
I didn't...

4277
02:13:58,480 --> 02:13:59,040
Guys!

4278
02:13:59,180 --> 02:14:01,100
Has there always been three trash cans?

4279
02:14:01,320 --> 02:14:02,460
I didn't look down!

4280
02:14:05,020 --> 02:14:05,580
Yeah?

4281
02:14:05,940 --> 02:14:07,560
Why would the trash cans be here?

4282
02:14:08,520 --> 02:14:10,560
Okay, there's always been three trash...

4283
02:14:10,560 --> 02:14:11,280
Two, four...

4284
02:14:11,280 --> 02:14:12,780
No, we have to start counting!

4285
02:14:13,220 --> 02:14:14,800
Two, four, six...

4286
02:14:14,800 --> 02:14:16,820
Two, four...

4287
02:14:16,820 --> 02:14:18,100
Wait, where's five?

4288
02:14:18,480 --> 02:14:20,280
Two, four, six...

4289
02:14:20,280 --> 02:14:20,520
Okay.

4290
02:14:22,340 --> 02:14:22,900
Two...

4291
02:14:25,640 --> 02:14:26,680
Four, five...

4292
02:14:26,680 --> 02:14:27,280
Where's the six?

4293
02:14:27,420 --> 02:14:28,300
There's the six broom!

4294
02:14:29,940 --> 02:14:30,460
Two...

4295
02:14:30,460 --> 02:14:31,900
Two, four, six...

4296
02:14:31,900 --> 02:14:33,660
Two, four, six...

4297
02:14:33,660 --> 02:14:36,340
Two, four...

4298
02:14:36,340 --> 02:14:37,980
Where's the six trash can?

4299
02:14:39,720 --> 02:14:40,240
Six!

4300
02:14:40,340 --> 02:14:40,600
Okay.

4301
02:14:40,780 --> 02:14:41,840
There's six of everything.

4302
02:14:42,320 --> 02:14:43,700
Two, four, five...

4303
02:14:43,700 --> 02:14:44,320
Wait, there's five...

4304
02:14:44,320 --> 02:14:44,700
Oh, six.

4305
02:14:44,880 --> 02:14:45,340
That's a...

4306
02:14:45,340 --> 02:14:46,200
Okay.

4307
02:14:47,300 --> 02:14:49,920
One, two, three, four, five, six.

4308
02:14:49,920 --> 02:14:50,820
I think we did it.

4309
02:14:50,880 --> 02:14:51,860
No anomalies.

4310
02:14:52,820 --> 02:14:55,100
If we get it wrong, I blame chat.

4311
02:14:58,920 --> 02:15:00,500
There's a seven urinal?

4312
02:15:01,560 --> 02:15:02,920
There's a seven urinal?

4313
02:15:03,860 --> 02:15:04,760
I don't know...

4314
02:15:05,480 --> 02:15:06,640
There's six urinals.

4315
02:15:06,700 --> 02:15:07,720
Someone can't even count.

4316
02:15:08,440 --> 02:15:08,980
Alright.

4317
02:15:09,080 --> 02:15:10,120
I think we're good.

4318
02:15:11,340 --> 02:15:13,280
I think there's no anomalies.

4319
02:15:14,480 --> 02:15:15,020
Wow.

4320
02:15:15,320 --> 02:15:16,400
Min is so slow.

4321
02:15:16,400 --> 02:15:20,640
Of course she goes to the bathroom when there's no anomalies.

4322
02:15:22,020 --> 02:15:22,940
Look at her.

4323
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:25,760
Was there...

4324
02:15:25,760 --> 02:15:27,480
Yes, there was six toilets.

4325
02:15:27,540 --> 02:15:31,100
Because the whole game is based off of six, six, six.

4326
02:15:31,360 --> 02:15:32,660
So there's six of everything.

4327
02:15:32,700 --> 02:15:32,840
Hold on.

4328
02:15:32,860 --> 02:15:33,600
I gotta get tea.

4329
02:15:33,920 --> 02:15:34,360
Hold on.

4330
02:15:34,360 --> 02:15:35,500
Min, don't come over here!

4331
02:15:36,740 --> 02:15:37,840
There's no anomalies!

4332
02:15:37,960 --> 02:15:38,600
Get over here!

4333
02:15:39,440 --> 02:15:39,960
No!

4334
02:15:40,080 --> 02:15:41,700
You can't just...

4335
02:15:43,860 --> 02:15:46,220
What do you mean you have to get...

4336
02:15:46,220 --> 02:15:46,380
What do you mean you have to get...

4337
02:15:46,400 --> 02:15:46,680
tea!

4338
02:15:47,320 --> 02:15:48,920
There's no anomalies!

4339
02:15:51,580 --> 02:15:53,620
If only I could just leave.

4340
02:15:55,980 --> 02:15:57,240
Oh my god.

4341
02:15:57,360 --> 02:15:58,840
Oh I can push her to the right!

4342
02:15:59,100 --> 02:15:59,720
Oh my god.

4343
02:15:59,740 --> 02:16:01,140
Why didn't you guys say that earlier?

4344
02:16:01,820 --> 02:16:02,680
Oh my god.

4345
02:16:02,740 --> 02:16:03,880
I could've just pushed her.

4346
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:05,020
I can't believe it.

4347
02:16:05,640 --> 02:16:07,440
I could've done that in the very beginning.

4348
02:16:10,100 --> 02:16:10,980
I messed up.

4349
02:16:11,440 --> 02:16:12,040
Wait, no?

4350
02:16:12,520 --> 02:16:12,940
Okay.

4351
02:16:13,280 --> 02:16:13,900
There we go.

4352
02:16:16,780 --> 02:16:17,420
Alright.

4353
02:16:17,560 --> 02:16:19,640
We're getting you to the other side!

4354
02:16:19,980 --> 02:16:23,920
We're getting you to the other side!

4355
02:16:24,460 --> 02:16:25,100
Alright.

4356
02:16:25,700 --> 02:16:26,340
Nice.

4357
02:16:26,620 --> 02:16:27,260
We did it.

4358
02:16:27,900 --> 02:16:29,060
We're professionals.

4359
02:16:29,280 --> 02:16:30,280
Okay, I gotta like...

4360
02:16:30,280 --> 02:16:31,060
make sure...

4361
02:16:31,060 --> 02:16:34,120
In case there is...

4362
02:16:34,120 --> 02:16:35,420
an anomaly...

4363
02:16:35,420 --> 02:16:37,460
Or there's no anomaly as well.

4364
02:16:38,180 --> 02:16:39,000
Okay, no.

4365
02:16:40,120 --> 02:16:40,440
Alright.

4366
02:16:40,660 --> 02:16:41,400
Here we go.

4367
02:16:42,180 --> 02:16:42,900
I'm gaming.

4368
02:16:45,180 --> 02:16:45,820
Alright.

4369
02:16:46,500 --> 02:16:48,120
Everything looks the same.

4370
02:16:48,160 --> 02:16:48,640
I'm back.

4371
02:16:48,840 --> 02:16:49,740
Oh my god.

4372
02:16:49,800 --> 02:16:51,520
You scared the shit out of me.

4373
02:16:51,560 --> 02:16:54,460
I had to push you to the other side of the elevator.

4374
02:16:55,160 --> 02:16:56,460
I guess there was...

4375
02:16:56,460 --> 02:16:56,940
Everything looks good?

4376
02:16:57,200 --> 02:16:58,260
There was no anomaly.

4377
02:16:58,260 --> 02:16:59,400
You have plenty of time.

4378
02:16:59,560 --> 02:17:00,500
I'm gonna check.

4379
02:17:00,940 --> 02:17:01,960
What do you mean?

4380
02:17:01,980 --> 02:17:03,800
We're on the other floor now?

4381
02:17:03,840 --> 02:17:04,240
Oh, nope.

4382
02:17:04,640 --> 02:17:07,860
What do you mean?

4383
02:17:07,960 --> 02:17:09,400
Oh, let me double check.

4384
02:17:09,440 --> 02:17:10,820
This is a new floor.

4385
02:17:11,640 --> 02:17:12,260
Come on.

4386
02:17:13,040 --> 02:17:14,180
Let's hurry it up.

4387
02:17:14,180 --> 02:17:17,880
I literally pushed you from one elevator to the next.

4388
02:17:20,920 --> 02:17:21,440
Alright.

4389
02:17:21,540 --> 02:17:22,040
Here we go.

4390
02:17:22,680 --> 02:17:23,200
405.

4391
02:17:23,200 --> 02:17:24,200
Was she brave, you guys?

4392
02:17:24,240 --> 02:17:24,860
Be honest.

4393
02:17:25,060 --> 02:17:25,880
I was so brave.

4394
02:17:26,020 --> 02:17:26,500
I counted.

4395
02:17:26,620 --> 02:17:28,060
I learned how to count today.

4396
02:17:28,420 --> 02:17:28,940
Really?

4397
02:17:28,940 --> 02:17:30,380
I learned my ABCs.

4398
02:17:30,480 --> 02:17:31,640
You took your counting medicine.

4399
02:17:32,020 --> 02:17:33,240
Yeah, I took my counting medicine.

4400
02:17:34,300 --> 02:17:37,100
I just realized we have to count these items as well.

4401
02:17:37,220 --> 02:17:37,760
Because like...

4402
02:17:37,760 --> 02:17:39,280
How many trash cans?

4403
02:17:39,620 --> 02:17:39,940
Six.

4404
02:17:40,140 --> 02:17:40,660
Six?

4405
02:17:40,780 --> 02:17:40,960
Okay.

4406
02:17:40,960 --> 02:17:41,920
Yeah, it's 666.

4407
02:17:42,260 --> 02:17:42,280
Oh, it's 7.

4408
02:17:42,520 --> 02:17:43,220
No, there's 7.

4409
02:17:43,760 --> 02:17:45,740
2, 4, 6.

4410
02:17:45,820 --> 02:17:46,380
What do you mean?

4411
02:17:46,480 --> 02:17:46,940
You're 6.

4412
02:17:47,680 --> 02:17:49,060
Someone did learn to count.

4413
02:17:49,380 --> 02:17:50,460
I didn't learn how to count.

4414
02:17:50,460 --> 02:17:51,020
It's me.

4415
02:17:51,400 --> 02:17:53,140
I didn't learn how to count.

4416
02:17:53,140 --> 02:17:53,440
It's me.

4417
02:17:55,620 --> 02:17:56,860
Someone didn't learn.

4418
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:58,280
2, 4, 6.

4419
02:17:58,500 --> 02:18:02,200
2, 4, 6.

4420
02:18:02,560 --> 02:18:03,160
2, 4, 6.

4421
02:18:03,160 --> 02:18:04,460
2, 4, 6.

4422
02:18:05,500 --> 02:18:06,280
I think we're good.

4423
02:18:06,500 --> 02:18:07,360
I think we're good too.

4424
02:18:08,580 --> 02:18:09,500
I'm pretty sure.

4425
02:18:09,760 --> 02:18:10,360
I think so.

4426
02:18:12,220 --> 02:18:13,200
Back to kindergarten.

4427
02:18:13,660 --> 02:18:15,840
Min didn't take her counting medicine.

4428
02:18:16,500 --> 02:18:17,140
That's okay.

4429
02:18:17,380 --> 02:18:18,780
Send me back to kindergarten.

4430
02:18:19,020 --> 02:18:21,360
Let me be a child again.

4431
02:18:24,040 --> 02:18:24,640
Alright.

4432
02:18:25,520 --> 02:18:26,120
Yay!

4433
02:18:26,420 --> 02:18:27,020
4, 0, 6!

4434
02:18:27,980 --> 02:18:29,280
4, 0, 6!

4435
02:18:29,640 --> 02:18:31,060
4, 0, 6!

4436
02:18:31,360 --> 02:18:32,480
4, 0, 6!

4437
02:18:33,420 --> 02:18:36,220
That's pretty impressive you were able to punch me all the way.

4438
02:18:36,300 --> 02:18:36,680
I'm trying to make sure...

4439
02:18:39,580 --> 02:18:40,180
God.

4440
02:18:43,080 --> 02:18:44,080
What was that?

4441
02:18:44,220 --> 02:18:45,060
What was that?

4442
02:18:45,140 --> 02:18:45,740
It was that blow dryer.

4443
02:18:46,080 --> 02:18:46,980
Oh my god.

4444
02:18:48,300 --> 02:18:49,680
The blow dryer.

4445
02:18:50,280 --> 02:18:53,140
That scared me so bad I couldn't even make a noise.

4446
02:18:53,780 --> 02:18:55,560
It's just like, Whoa, shit!

4447
02:18:55,600 --> 02:18:57,640
I thought it was something chasing us.

4448
02:18:57,720 --> 02:19:00,700
We talked too much shit about the blow dryers, guys.

4449
02:19:02,640 --> 02:19:03,160
Okay.

4450
02:19:04,260 --> 02:19:05,560
Alright, we're still normal.

4451
02:19:06,800 --> 02:19:09,700
2, 4 Let's test our counting.

4452
02:19:09,880 --> 02:19:10,600
2, 4, 6.

4453
02:19:12,660 --> 02:19:13,140
Oh,

4454
02:19:16,640 --> 02:19:19,140
we have to make sure to look between the toilets too.

4455
02:19:19,540 --> 02:19:22,220
Why is this toilet filled with...

4456
02:19:22,220 --> 02:19:24,560
Was there always a toilet in here?

4457
02:19:24,660 --> 02:19:27,940
Yeah, isn't this the handicap slot too?

4458
02:19:28,580 --> 02:19:30,000
Yeah, because it's a bigger stall.

4459
02:19:30,880 --> 02:19:32,220
That's so messed up.

4460
02:19:32,280 --> 02:19:33,220
They did not care.

4461
02:19:33,780 --> 02:19:34,940
This is a hospital!

4462
02:19:35,140 --> 02:19:37,120
There's so many people in wheelchairs!

4463
02:19:37,120 --> 02:19:39,620
And yet they filled it up!

4464
02:19:39,980 --> 02:19:41,240
2, 4, 6.

4465
02:19:41,360 --> 02:19:41,560
I'm looking up.

4466
02:19:41,680 --> 02:19:42,920
I mean, we counted everything.

4467
02:19:43,160 --> 02:19:43,860
There's 6 lights.

4468
02:19:44,080 --> 02:19:45,960
2, 4... Wait, no, there's 8 lights.

4469
02:19:46,380 --> 02:19:47,600
Has there always been 8 lights?

4470
02:19:49,700 --> 02:19:51,920
I don't think it's that meticulous, right?

4471
02:19:52,240 --> 02:19:53,280
I don't think so either.

4472
02:19:53,440 --> 02:19:54,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4473
02:19:54,440 --> 02:19:55,720
There's a bloody handprint?

4474
02:19:55,860 --> 02:19:57,220
What do you mean bloody handprint?

4475
02:19:58,320 --> 02:19:59,780
Everybody's spamming handprint.

4476
02:20:00,540 --> 02:20:00,980
Handprint?

4477
02:20:01,520 --> 02:20:02,860
Is it in the toilet maybe?

4478
02:20:03,140 --> 02:20:04,860
Did anyone spam handprint on your chat?

4479
02:20:07,120 --> 02:20:08,360
There are 4 lights.

4480
02:20:08,680 --> 02:20:09,200
What do you mean?

4481
02:20:09,520 --> 02:20:10,240
There's 4 lights?

4482
02:20:10,240 --> 02:20:11,500
Handprint by the kid's urinal.

4483
02:20:11,680 --> 02:20:12,700
There's a kid's urinal?

4484
02:20:12,800 --> 02:20:13,640
There's a kid's urinal?

4485
02:20:13,960 --> 02:20:14,860
I don't think there is.

4486
02:20:14,900 --> 02:20:16,780
They're just saying that the fuck with us.

4487
02:20:16,840 --> 02:20:17,140
Oh!

4488
02:20:18,100 --> 02:20:19,440
That's not a urinal!

4489
02:20:19,440 --> 02:20:20,360
That's a snake!

4490
02:20:21,960 --> 02:20:24,620
Wait, there's also like a hand down there.

4491
02:20:24,660 --> 02:20:26,320
Yeah, there's something in the trash can.

4492
02:20:26,560 --> 02:20:27,380
Wow, that's sneaky.

4493
02:20:27,880 --> 02:20:29,140
Oh, that was a sneaky one.

4494
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:30,880
Is it a hand?

4495
02:20:31,220 --> 02:20:32,520
I'm trying to see it.

4496
02:20:32,780 --> 02:20:32,900
I think it was.

4497
02:20:32,900 --> 02:20:33,900
I'm pretty sure it's a hand.

4498
02:20:34,360 --> 02:20:35,920
We're not short enough to see it.

4499
02:20:35,960 --> 02:20:36,520
We're not a chat.

4500
02:20:36,520 --> 02:20:39,300
We now know someone in the chat pees in sinks.

4501
02:20:43,280 --> 02:20:47,140
Someone uses the kid's urinal to pee in the sink.

4502
02:20:47,420 --> 02:20:51,940
I don't think this person is allowed near the kid's hospital.

4503
02:20:54,900 --> 02:20:56,740
Someone's peeing in sinks over here.

4504
02:20:57,240 --> 02:20:59,660
In public, you're in public sinks.

4505
02:20:59,660 --> 02:21:00,380
What if you stand there?

4506
02:21:00,420 --> 02:21:01,240
I dare you to stand there.

4507
02:21:01,480 --> 02:21:02,200
Stand where?

4508
02:21:03,040 --> 02:21:03,820
Over there?

4509
02:21:04,540 --> 02:21:05,980
Wait, there's a shadow over there.

4510
02:21:05,980 --> 02:21:07,740
I triple dog dare you.

4511
02:21:07,840 --> 02:21:08,860
I already dared you!

4512
02:21:10,180 --> 02:21:10,740
It's gone.

4513
02:21:10,960 --> 02:21:11,420
Oh, it's gone.

4514
02:21:12,100 --> 02:21:12,940
Oh, it's back!

4515
02:21:13,120 --> 02:21:13,720
Wait, wait, wait.

4516
02:21:13,720 --> 02:21:14,280
Now it's your turn.

4517
02:21:14,880 --> 02:21:15,680
Oh, it's gone.

4518
02:21:15,880 --> 02:21:16,940
You like absorbed him.

4519
02:21:17,260 --> 02:21:18,160
Yeah, yeah, you too.

4520
02:21:18,280 --> 02:21:18,820
Alright, you too.

4521
02:21:18,820 --> 02:21:20,740
Oh, it didn't move it back any further though.

4522
02:21:20,960 --> 02:21:21,920
Yeah, it's just there.

4523
02:21:22,300 --> 02:21:22,700
Alright.

4524
02:21:23,480 --> 02:21:23,880
Anomaly!

4525
02:21:24,340 --> 02:21:25,400
We're so good at this.

4526
02:21:25,640 --> 02:21:26,140
I know.

4527
02:21:26,200 --> 02:21:28,020
We're like professional anomaly hunters.

4528
02:21:30,680 --> 02:21:33,140
Even, yeah, we didn't get help from chat at all.

4529
02:21:33,440 --> 02:21:34,180
Yeah, yeah.

4530
02:21:34,240 --> 02:21:35,040
We got like...

4531
02:21:35,040 --> 02:21:36,740
We've like never failed.

4532
02:21:37,300 --> 02:21:39,000
We literally have never failed.

4533
02:21:39,200 --> 02:21:41,340
Yeah, we've had... we've been consistent throughout this.

4534
02:21:41,560 --> 02:21:43,660
This game is just a really long game.

4535
02:21:43,900 --> 02:21:46,280
Why do you run past the door?

4536
02:21:46,580 --> 02:21:47,380
Why do you say...

4537
02:21:47,380 --> 02:21:47,620
Oh!

4538
02:21:49,220 --> 02:21:49,820
Brother!

4539
02:21:49,820 --> 02:21:50,420
Brother!

4540
02:21:50,540 --> 02:21:51,540
Brother, it's okay!

4541
02:21:51,640 --> 02:21:51,860
Brother!

4542
02:21:52,320 --> 02:21:53,280
Brother, it's okay!

4543
02:21:53,580 --> 02:21:54,160
It's a miracle!

4544
02:21:57,680 --> 02:21:59,320
Brother has risen.

4545
02:22:00,660 --> 02:22:03,740
On the fourth day he rises.

4546
02:22:06,700 --> 02:22:07,900
Oh my god, guys!

4547
02:22:07,900 --> 02:22:09,120
Metal gear rising.

4548
02:22:10,480 --> 02:22:13,700
Oh my god, it's a miracle, guys!

4549
02:22:14,420 --> 02:22:16,640
Why do you always run past... oh.

4550
02:22:16,860 --> 02:22:19,080
Okay, someone peed in the urinals.

4551
02:22:19,400 --> 02:22:21,400
Someone actually peed in the urinals.

4552
02:22:21,820 --> 02:22:21,840
Yeah.

4553
02:22:22,500 --> 02:22:24,360
They mixed the juices up.

4554
02:22:25,140 --> 02:22:26,780
What do you mean by that?

4555
02:22:27,680 --> 02:22:29,660
What do you mean by that?

4556
02:22:29,660 --> 02:22:30,580
Only bros understand.

4557
02:22:31,400 --> 02:22:34,960
I don't think even bros will understand what you mean.

4558
02:22:34,960 --> 02:22:36,280
Only bros know.

4559
02:22:42,560 --> 02:22:43,780
Alright, let's see.

4560
02:22:44,240 --> 02:22:45,040
Hello, brother.

4561
02:22:45,140 --> 02:22:45,520
Don't run past.

4562
02:22:45,700 --> 02:22:46,200
Just run...

4563
02:22:46,640 --> 02:22:47,540
Just run inside.

4564
02:22:47,760 --> 02:22:48,880
Wait, there's something weird.

4565
02:22:49,840 --> 02:22:50,600
Something weird?

4566
02:22:50,720 --> 02:22:50,980
Look, look.

4567
02:22:51,260 --> 02:22:51,520
Oh!

4568
02:22:51,700 --> 02:22:52,260
Yeah, you see that?

4569
02:22:52,260 --> 02:22:53,560
The caution signs are moving.

4570
02:22:53,720 --> 02:22:54,080
Yeah.

4571
02:22:54,740 --> 02:22:55,740
Wait, they're coming.

4572
02:22:55,900 --> 02:22:56,720
They're coming towards us.

4573
02:22:56,780 --> 02:22:57,120
Wait, they're coming after us.

4574
02:22:57,140 --> 02:22:58,220
Wait, they're after coming after us.

4575
02:22:58,220 --> 02:22:58,520
Yeah.

4576
02:22:58,880 --> 02:23:00,640
Wait, what would the caution signs do?

4577
02:23:00,700 --> 02:23:01,180
Wait, let's see.

4578
02:23:01,920 --> 02:23:02,900
What if we die?

4579
02:23:03,720 --> 02:23:05,820
What if they do fucking eat us?

4580
02:23:05,960 --> 02:23:06,240
They're converging.

4581
02:23:06,240 --> 02:23:06,540
Like, what?

4582
02:23:06,740 --> 02:23:07,300
They're converging.

4583
02:23:07,440 --> 02:23:08,120
They're converging.

4584
02:23:08,140 --> 02:23:09,800
It's like a mating ritual.

4585
02:23:10,220 --> 02:23:10,660
Oh!

4586
02:23:10,700 --> 02:23:10,780
Oh!

4587
02:23:10,780 --> 02:23:12,600
We're watching a mating ritual right now.

4588
02:23:13,200 --> 02:23:13,640
Oh!

4589
02:23:13,840 --> 02:23:14,300
Nope.

4590
02:23:14,720 --> 02:23:15,180
Oh!

4591
02:23:15,700 --> 02:23:16,680
I don't wanna...

4592
02:23:16,680 --> 02:23:17,680
I told you, it does nothing.

4593
02:23:17,680 --> 02:23:18,380
I'm not their mate.

4594
02:23:18,620 --> 02:23:19,420
I'm not their mate.

4595
02:23:19,460 --> 02:23:20,760
Come on, it was a mate.

4596
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:22,820
I think they'll block the entrance.

4597
02:23:23,060 --> 02:23:23,540
Oh, maybe.

4598
02:23:23,560 --> 02:23:25,220
Yeah, I think they're gonna block the exit.

4599
02:23:25,840 --> 02:23:27,080
Alright, the floor is wet.

4600
02:23:27,460 --> 02:23:27,720
Thank you for the rain.

4601
02:23:27,720 --> 02:23:28,340
Oh my god.

4602
02:23:28,720 --> 02:23:30,080
Maria, thank you for the rain.

4603
02:23:30,220 --> 02:23:31,200
The floor is wet.

4604
02:23:31,760 --> 02:23:32,740
The floor is wet?

4605
02:23:32,800 --> 02:23:32,880
Yeah.

4606
02:23:32,880 --> 02:23:33,140
Ew.

4607
02:23:34,480 --> 02:23:36,480
From all the juices in the urine.

4608
02:23:39,400 --> 02:23:40,400
Your words, not mine.

4609
02:23:40,400 --> 02:23:42,100
See, I told you, you knew what it means.

4610
02:23:42,240 --> 02:23:42,820
I knew it.

4611
02:23:42,840 --> 02:23:43,040
See?

4612
02:23:43,280 --> 02:23:44,560
She knows what it means.

4613
02:23:44,920 --> 02:23:46,040
Don't run past the door.

4614
02:23:46,120 --> 02:23:46,860
Just go straight in.

4615
02:23:47,260 --> 02:23:48,040
Don't run past.

4616
02:23:48,140 --> 02:23:48,940
I've always...

4617
02:23:48,940 --> 02:23:50,960
I've always walked in.

4618
02:23:50,980 --> 02:23:52,020
I don't know what you're talking about.

4619
02:23:52,020 --> 02:23:52,720
No, you haven't.

4620
02:23:52,720 --> 02:23:53,980
I don't know what you're talking about.

4621
02:23:54,080 --> 02:23:55,160
Literally every time.

4622
02:23:55,160 --> 02:23:57,400
She's rewriting history right now.

4623
02:23:57,520 --> 02:23:57,700
No.

4624
02:24:00,300 --> 02:24:01,720
She's rewriting history.

4625
02:24:02,260 --> 02:24:02,720
No.

4626
02:24:02,720 --> 02:24:02,860
She's rewriting history.

4627
02:24:03,400 --> 02:24:04,280
Let's take a look at this to see if she's right.

4628
02:24:04,280 --> 02:24:04,300
Okay, here we go.

4629
02:24:04,300 --> 02:24:05,140
2, 4, 6.

4630
02:24:05,320 --> 02:24:06,260
There are 6 trash cans.

4631
02:24:06,680 --> 02:24:08,320
I think it's no anomaly.

4632
02:24:08,920 --> 02:24:10,660
I think this one's good.

4633
02:24:11,480 --> 02:24:12,480
I'm looking up.

4634
02:24:13,400 --> 02:24:14,640
Are the toilets- There's nothing in the mirror.

4635
02:24:14,900 --> 02:24:16,060
Are the toilets up or are they normal?

4636
02:24:16,060 --> 02:24:16,960
Yeah, they've always been up.

4637
02:24:17,280 --> 02:24:18,640
It's a men's urinal.

4638
02:24:19,920 --> 02:24:21,280
The urinal is different.

4639
02:24:21,760 --> 02:24:22,960
It's a men's bathroom.

4640
02:24:25,500 --> 02:24:26,740
I guess so.

4641
02:24:26,860 --> 02:24:27,560
The doors are cracked?

4642
02:24:27,560 --> 02:24:27,820
Are you okay brother?

4643
02:24:27,860 --> 02:24:29,400
There are no doors that are cracked.

4644
02:24:29,840 --> 02:24:30,640
What do you mean?

4645
02:24:30,980 --> 02:24:32,240
All the doors have been cracked.

4646
02:24:32,340 --> 02:24:32,540
Yeah.

4647
02:24:32,620 --> 02:24:32,860
Okay.

4648
02:24:33,500 --> 02:24:35,300
Someone was like, saw something.

4649
02:24:35,480 --> 02:24:36,280
What did you see?

4650
02:24:36,580 --> 02:24:38,140
Did you take your meds?

4651
02:24:38,260 --> 02:24:39,400
I saw something.

4652
02:24:39,440 --> 02:24:40,480
I saw you.

4653
02:24:41,200 --> 02:24:42,740
I saw something.

4654
02:24:43,720 --> 02:24:46,080
Nothing in the mirror.

4655
02:24:47,060 --> 02:24:48,440
There's sticks of everything.

4656
02:24:51,020 --> 02:24:52,820
Are you gaslighting?

4657
02:24:53,080 --> 02:24:54,280
No, I'm not.

4658
02:24:54,620 --> 02:24:55,260
Wow!

4659
02:25:00,220 --> 02:25:01,360
He's like peek-a-boo.

4660
02:25:04,640 --> 02:25:06,440
I think there's a biggie in here.

4661
02:25:06,600 --> 02:25:07,380
Oh no!

4662
02:25:09,020 --> 02:25:09,760
Donkey crash?

4663
02:25:10,660 --> 02:25:11,720
Oh no, I'm okay now.

4664
02:25:11,780 --> 02:25:12,140
I'm okay.

4665
02:25:12,460 --> 02:25:13,040
I'm okay.

4666
02:25:13,320 --> 02:25:14,160
Oh my god.

4667
02:25:14,180 --> 02:25:14,980
It was so scary.

4668
02:25:15,200 --> 02:25:18,520
It was so scary because I said that and then everything just stopped.

4669
02:25:19,200 --> 02:25:22,160
Everything stopped moving and I was like, oh no.

4670
02:25:22,680 --> 02:25:23,560
What happened?

4671
02:25:25,460 --> 02:25:28,700
Wait, are there more fire things than usual?

4672
02:25:28,820 --> 02:25:30,540
I mean, you can literally count.

4673
02:25:31,560 --> 02:25:32,920
Was there always six?

4674
02:25:32,920 --> 02:25:33,900
There's six of everything.

4675
02:25:34,060 --> 02:25:37,780
Yeah, I mean, I was like, was there always six in 666?

4676
02:25:41,280 --> 02:25:42,500
Oh my god.

4677
02:25:42,580 --> 02:25:43,900
That was so spooky.

4678
02:25:44,720 --> 02:25:45,240
Spooky!

4679
02:25:46,200 --> 02:25:47,720
Her stream is alive.

4680
02:25:48,080 --> 02:25:49,460
My stream is alive now.

4681
02:25:51,280 --> 02:25:53,060
I think there's nothing here.

4682
02:25:53,260 --> 02:25:55,240
There's been like not a lot of anomalies for this one.

4683
02:25:55,260 --> 02:25:56,440
Not for this one, no.

4684
02:25:56,600 --> 02:25:56,940
Yeah.

4685
02:25:56,940 --> 02:25:58,580
I mean, it's like such an empty room.

4686
02:25:58,800 --> 02:25:59,220
What are you gonna do?

4687
02:25:59,220 --> 02:26:02,420
I think like this one's like harder to have anomalies.

4688
02:26:02,740 --> 02:26:03,600
I think so too.

4689
02:26:03,880 --> 02:26:04,560
I think we're fine.

4690
02:26:06,160 --> 02:26:06,560
Alright.

4691
02:26:07,700 --> 02:26:08,760
Oh, I can't punch you.

4692
02:26:08,920 --> 02:26:10,080
Haha, you hit your quota.

4693
02:26:10,480 --> 02:26:10,880
I'm trying.

4694
02:26:10,880 --> 02:26:11,920
What happened?

4695
02:26:12,300 --> 02:26:13,720
Why can't I punch all the time?

4696
02:26:13,800 --> 02:26:15,260
How come we can't have six brothers?

4697
02:26:15,440 --> 02:26:16,280
I don't understand.

4698
02:26:18,140 --> 02:26:21,760
We can only have five brothers, but it goes up to four players.

4699
02:26:22,100 --> 02:26:22,300
Yeah.

4700
02:26:23,740 --> 02:26:24,500
Where's our...

4701
02:26:24,500 --> 02:26:25,340
Where's our...

4702
02:26:25,340 --> 02:26:27,120
Where's brother four, five, and six?

4703
02:26:27,360 --> 02:26:28,620
We went in the wrong elevator.

4704
02:26:33,670 --> 02:26:34,430
This was you.

4705
02:26:35,190 --> 02:26:36,010
No, it wasn't!

4706
02:26:36,030 --> 02:26:36,470
This was you.

4707
02:26:36,870 --> 02:26:37,470
No, it wasn't!

4708
02:26:37,530 --> 02:26:38,390
You left the way!

4709
02:26:38,490 --> 02:26:39,150
This was you.

4710
02:26:39,210 --> 02:26:40,070
No, I followed you.

4711
02:26:40,110 --> 02:26:40,930
I followed you.

4712
02:26:40,990 --> 02:26:41,950
You could have stopped me.

4713
02:26:42,030 --> 02:26:42,310
It's okay.

4714
02:26:42,310 --> 02:26:42,830
We can speedrun.

4715
02:26:42,950 --> 02:26:43,470
You could have stopped me.

4716
02:26:43,690 --> 02:26:44,810
We can speedrun!

4717
02:26:44,850 --> 02:26:44,910
We can speedrun!

4718
02:26:44,930 --> 02:26:45,710
We can speedrun!

4719
02:26:49,090 --> 02:26:49,450
Handprint.

4720
02:26:49,590 --> 02:26:49,950
No.

4721
02:26:50,470 --> 02:26:51,910
Check if the thing appears.

4722
02:26:52,230 --> 02:26:53,750
Wait, but what if there's new anomalies?

4723
02:26:55,790 --> 02:26:57,790
What if there's new ones that we don't...

4724
02:26:57,790 --> 02:26:58,150
Oh, wait, no.

4725
02:26:58,150 --> 02:26:58,690
This is zero.

4726
02:26:58,790 --> 02:26:59,210
This is zero.

4727
02:26:59,250 --> 02:26:59,770
It's always zero.

4728
02:26:59,770 --> 02:27:00,330
Oh, this is zero.

4729
02:27:00,350 --> 02:27:00,710
You're right.

4730
02:27:00,710 --> 02:27:00,990
You're right.

4731
02:27:00,990 --> 02:27:01,270
You're right.

4732
02:27:01,590 --> 02:27:01,990
No!

4733
02:27:02,730 --> 02:27:03,130
No!

4734
02:27:05,460 --> 02:27:07,640
Why didn't you stop me?

4735
02:27:07,700 --> 02:27:08,380
No, no.

4736
02:27:08,740 --> 02:27:09,440
This is Chad's fault.

4737
02:27:09,640 --> 02:27:10,920
They should have told us.

4738
02:27:10,920 --> 02:27:12,200
They should have told us.

4739
02:27:12,280 --> 02:27:15,380
Instead, they laughed at our jokes because we're just so funny.

4740
02:27:21,440 --> 02:27:22,180
Oh my...

4741
02:27:22,960 --> 02:27:23,360
Okay.

4742
02:27:24,260 --> 02:27:24,660
Okay.

4743
02:27:26,200 --> 02:27:26,600
Okay.

4744
02:27:28,620 --> 02:27:29,580
Thank you, game.

4745
02:27:29,760 --> 02:27:30,360
Thank you, game.

4746
02:27:30,420 --> 02:27:30,740
Thank you.

4747
02:27:30,800 --> 02:27:31,220
Don't worry.

4748
02:27:31,280 --> 02:27:31,820
We can speedrun.

4749
02:27:31,900 --> 02:27:32,720
What floor are we on?

4750
02:27:32,820 --> 02:27:33,900
How far did we get to?

4751
02:27:34,320 --> 02:27:35,560
How far did we get to?

4752
02:27:35,780 --> 02:27:36,140
We got to 13.

4753
02:27:36,220 --> 02:27:37,720
We got to 13, man!

4754
02:27:37,920 --> 02:27:39,040
We got to 13!

4755
02:27:39,200 --> 02:27:39,980
Oh, oh, oh.

4756
02:27:39,980 --> 02:27:40,640
What the fuck?

4757
02:27:41,880 --> 02:27:42,640
I dare you.

4758
02:27:42,660 --> 02:27:43,340
I triple dog dare you.

4759
02:27:43,360 --> 02:27:44,220
I triple dog dare you.

4760
02:27:44,260 --> 02:27:44,380
You know what?

4761
02:27:44,520 --> 02:27:45,580
I'm not afraid.

4762
02:27:49,580 --> 02:27:50,940
Oh my god.

4763
02:27:50,980 --> 02:27:51,500
I killed...

4764
02:27:53,240 --> 02:27:54,320
You murdered them.

4765
02:27:54,580 --> 02:27:55,580
You didn't see anything.

4766
02:27:57,220 --> 02:27:59,240
You cleaned up the bodies really good.

4767
02:28:00,260 --> 02:28:01,040
Oh my god.

4768
02:28:01,260 --> 02:28:01,920
You didn't see anything.

4769
02:28:02,080 --> 02:28:03,080
I don't know what you're talking about.

4770
02:28:03,180 --> 02:28:03,260
You killed them.

4771
02:28:03,360 --> 02:28:04,780
No, I did not, brother.

4772
02:28:05,040 --> 02:28:07,260
Remember, there's always been three brothers.

4773
02:28:07,360 --> 02:28:08,240
Remember that.

4774
02:28:08,480 --> 02:28:10,780
There's always been three brothers.

4775
02:28:10,900 --> 02:28:14,460
There's never been a fourth, fifth, or sixth brother.

4776
02:28:18,520 --> 02:28:21,640
Oh, that is the mating ritual again.

4777
02:28:22,020 --> 02:28:23,180
Oh, it's the mating ritual.

4778
02:28:23,180 --> 02:28:23,560
You're right.

4779
02:28:23,900 --> 02:28:24,780
Here they come.

4780
02:28:25,080 --> 02:28:25,560
Here they come.

4781
02:28:25,560 --> 02:28:27,780
This is why there's only three brothers.

4782
02:28:28,060 --> 02:28:29,840
I'm an accessory to murder.

4783
02:28:30,220 --> 02:28:31,420
I'm an accessory to murder.

4784
02:28:31,980 --> 02:28:33,500
They won't believe you.

4785
02:28:33,940 --> 02:28:35,100
Hey, but that was a new one.

4786
02:28:35,220 --> 02:28:35,540
So that means...

4787
02:28:35,540 --> 02:28:36,140
That was a new one.

4788
02:28:36,140 --> 02:28:36,300
Yeah.

4789
02:28:36,700 --> 02:28:37,140
Yeah.

4790
02:28:38,100 --> 02:28:38,580
Okay.

4791
02:28:38,800 --> 02:28:39,420
All right.

4792
02:28:39,660 --> 02:28:40,520
We got this.

4793
02:28:42,160 --> 02:28:43,080
Speed run.

4794
02:28:43,240 --> 02:28:44,020
Speed run.

4795
02:28:44,040 --> 02:28:44,800
Speed run.

4796
02:28:44,840 --> 02:28:45,480
Speed run.

4797
02:28:45,520 --> 02:28:45,520
Speed run.

4798
02:28:45,520 --> 02:28:45,940
Speed run.

4799
02:28:46,080 --> 02:28:48,540
We have to be careful of the head though, peeking out.

4800
02:28:48,780 --> 02:28:50,640
Yeah, but the head... I mean, I'll look at it.

4801
02:28:50,680 --> 02:28:51,380
I'm looking at it.

4802
02:28:52,240 --> 02:28:52,720
Okay.

4803
02:28:52,760 --> 02:28:53,640
I'm looking at it.

4804
02:28:53,920 --> 02:28:54,400
Okay.

4805
02:28:54,400 --> 02:28:55,920
I'm looking through the cracks right now while we...

4806
02:28:55,920 --> 02:28:57,600
I'm looking through the cracks.

4807
02:28:57,700 --> 02:28:58,440
I'm looking through the cracks.

4808
02:28:58,600 --> 02:28:59,260
I don't see anything.

4809
02:28:59,520 --> 02:28:59,560
I'm peeking.

4810
02:28:59,560 --> 02:29:00,180
I'm voyeuring.

4811
02:29:00,620 --> 02:29:01,060
I'm...

4812
02:29:01,060 --> 02:29:02,240
I don't see anything.

4813
02:29:02,440 --> 02:29:02,480
I don't see anything.

4814
02:29:02,480 --> 02:29:03,140
I don't see anything.

4815
02:29:03,140 --> 02:29:03,140
I don't see anything.

4816
02:29:03,140 --> 02:29:03,140
I don't see anything.

4817
02:29:03,140 --> 02:29:04,640
Brother is still being brother.

4818
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:07,420
This is why he doesn't talk.

4819
02:29:11,180 --> 02:29:14,340
He saw some stuff he wasn't supposed to.

4820
02:29:14,420 --> 02:29:15,260
He saw some stuff.

4821
02:29:16,740 --> 02:29:17,620
Mating ritual.

4822
02:29:18,920 --> 02:29:19,900
Check for handprint.

4823
02:29:19,960 --> 02:29:20,640
I already looked.

4824
02:29:20,700 --> 02:29:21,200
I already looked.

4825
02:29:21,280 --> 02:29:21,740
We all looked.

4826
02:29:21,960 --> 02:29:22,680
Here we go.

4827
02:29:22,960 --> 02:29:23,400
405.

4828
02:29:23,920 --> 02:29:24,440
405.

4829
02:29:25,940 --> 02:29:27,520
Give it up for 405.

4830
02:29:29,400 --> 02:29:29,920
Bing.

4831
02:29:30,300 --> 02:29:30,820
Bing.

4832
02:29:30,860 --> 02:29:31,220
Bing.

4833
02:29:31,220 --> 02:29:31,540
Yeah.

4834
02:29:32,400 --> 02:29:32,920
Bing.

4835
02:29:32,920 --> 02:29:33,480
Alright, here we go.

4836
02:29:34,200 --> 02:29:35,160
Here we go.

4837
02:29:37,440 --> 02:29:39,420
Brother is still on the toilet.

4838
02:29:41,420 --> 02:29:42,300
It's so loud.

4839
02:29:44,040 --> 02:29:45,960
It's so damn loud.

4840
02:29:47,320 --> 02:29:48,820
I never expect it.

4841
02:29:48,920 --> 02:29:51,100
No one ever expects some low drives.

4842
02:29:51,360 --> 02:29:51,620
Oh gosh.

4843
02:29:51,620 --> 02:29:53,060
At least we got it out of the way.

4844
02:29:53,680 --> 02:29:54,540
Oh my god.

4845
02:29:55,240 --> 02:29:56,020
Here we go.

4846
02:29:56,380 --> 02:29:57,400
Everybody, we're okay?

4847
02:29:57,460 --> 02:29:57,920
We're okay!

4848
02:29:57,940 --> 02:29:59,800
We're almost back to 13.

4849
02:30:01,720 --> 02:30:02,240
Brother...

4850
02:30:02,240 --> 02:30:05,340
Brother is not performing any miracles right now.

4851
02:30:05,740 --> 02:30:06,480
I'm looking...

4852
02:30:06,480 --> 02:30:07,040
There's no hazard.

4853
02:30:07,980 --> 02:30:08,500
What?

4854
02:30:08,620 --> 02:30:09,020
What?

4855
02:30:09,940 --> 02:30:10,880
Check the doors.

4856
02:30:13,300 --> 02:30:13,820
Oh.

4857
02:30:14,040 --> 02:30:14,520
Woah!

4858
02:30:14,620 --> 02:30:14,840
Woah!

4859
02:30:14,840 --> 02:30:15,700
What the fuck?

4860
02:30:15,760 --> 02:30:16,460
He closed the door!

4861
02:30:17,640 --> 02:30:18,160
What?

4862
02:30:18,160 --> 02:30:18,380
How could...

4863
02:30:18,380 --> 02:30:18,740
Stop!

4864
02:30:18,920 --> 02:30:20,620
Stop looking at the...

4865
02:30:20,620 --> 02:30:21,680
Stop it!

4866
02:30:21,740 --> 02:30:22,580
Stop looking at him!

4867
02:30:22,580 --> 02:30:24,480
How come she lets you look but I can't?

4868
02:30:26,200 --> 02:30:26,600
What?

4869
02:30:27,460 --> 02:30:29,360
Were you invited to something?

4870
02:30:30,440 --> 02:30:31,520
I think so.

4871
02:30:31,780 --> 02:30:32,460
I think so.

4872
02:30:32,560 --> 02:30:33,780
But that was also a new one.

4873
02:30:33,840 --> 02:30:34,400
That was a new one.

4874
02:30:34,420 --> 02:30:34,960
Yeah, that was a new one.

4875
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:35,760
I've never seen that one before.

4876
02:30:36,640 --> 02:30:37,440
Yeah, so...

4877
02:30:37,440 --> 02:30:39,100
That could've been 14, 15, and 16.

4878
02:30:39,960 --> 02:30:40,360
Brother...

4879
02:30:40,360 --> 02:30:41,980
Brother is not performing miracles.

4880
02:30:42,260 --> 02:30:42,660
No handprint.

4881
02:30:42,660 --> 02:30:43,600
No peek-a-boo.

4882
02:30:44,440 --> 02:30:45,200
No peek-a-boo.

4883
02:30:45,300 --> 02:30:45,940
No peek-a-boo.

4884
02:30:46,300 --> 02:30:48,040
We're missing like one new anomaly.

4885
02:30:49,320 --> 02:30:50,500
I think so too.

4886
02:30:50,620 --> 02:30:51,080
Yeah.

4887
02:30:51,320 --> 02:30:52,320
No hands.

4888
02:30:52,560 --> 02:30:53,680
We can see our faces.

4889
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:55,560
There's no hands coming from the vents.

4890
02:30:56,100 --> 02:30:57,220
I think we're fine.

4891
02:30:57,440 --> 02:30:58,380
No anomalies.

4892
02:30:59,100 --> 02:30:59,580
Okay.

4893
02:30:59,720 --> 02:31:00,300
Alright, nice.

4894
02:31:02,220 --> 02:31:02,700
Alright.

4895
02:31:02,960 --> 02:31:03,440
See?

4896
02:31:03,580 --> 02:31:04,440
We're so good at this.

4897
02:31:04,900 --> 02:31:05,380
Let's go.

4898
02:31:05,640 --> 02:31:07,480
We could've been at floor 500.

4899
02:31:07,900 --> 02:31:08,220
Okay.

4900
02:31:08,340 --> 02:31:09,620
We could've been at floor...

4901
02:31:09,620 --> 02:31:10,180
Shut up.

4902
02:31:10,180 --> 02:31:10,420
Shut up.

4903
02:31:10,640 --> 02:31:11,380
We'll be there.

4904
02:31:11,420 --> 02:31:11,800
We'll be there.

4905
02:31:11,880 --> 02:31:13,520
We could've been at floor 500.

4906
02:31:13,580 --> 02:31:14,140
We'll be there.

4907
02:31:14,160 --> 02:31:14,940
We'll be there.

4908
02:31:14,960 --> 02:31:15,540
We could've been there!

4909
02:31:15,700 --> 02:31:16,520
We'll be there!

4910
02:31:17,620 --> 02:31:18,560
We'll get there!

4911
02:31:21,620 --> 02:31:22,260
Okay.

4912
02:31:23,200 --> 02:31:23,840
Brother?

4913
02:31:24,160 --> 02:31:25,460
Brother sitting down.

4914
02:31:26,120 --> 02:31:26,760
Faces?

4915
02:31:27,020 --> 02:31:27,660
Handprint!

4916
02:31:27,820 --> 02:31:28,260
Handprint!

4917
02:31:28,360 --> 02:31:28,580
Handprint!

4918
02:31:28,700 --> 02:31:28,840
Handprint!

4919
02:31:28,840 --> 02:31:29,920
All right, back to the elevator.

4920
02:31:30,360 --> 02:31:31,420
Back to the elevator.

4921
02:31:31,820 --> 02:31:36,120
Bro, we got a routine going on now.

4922
02:31:36,220 --> 02:31:37,140
We have a system!

4923
02:31:37,500 --> 02:31:37,960
I know!

4924
02:31:37,960 --> 02:31:39,080
We're Speedrunners!

4925
02:31:39,100 --> 02:31:39,980
We're Speedrunners.

4926
02:31:40,020 --> 02:31:41,080

4927
02:31:41,200 --> 02:31:41,960

4928

Speakrun.com.

4929
02:31:45,900 --> 02:31:47,280
Why are we speedrunning?

4930
02:31:47,280 --> 02:31:48,600
Because we...

4931
02:31:49,120 --> 02:31:50,740
No, no, because you...

4932
02:31:51,280 --> 02:31:52,460
Chat messed up.

4933
02:31:54,460 --> 02:31:55,340
Brothers, brothering.

4934
02:31:55,340 --> 02:31:56,300
Brothers, brothering.

4935
02:31:56,300 --> 02:31:56,980
We have faces.

4936
02:31:57,780 --> 02:31:58,820
We have faces.

4937
02:31:58,860 --> 02:31:59,960
There's no shadow footprint.

4938
02:32:00,180 --> 02:32:00,420
Oh, there's the peek-a-boo!

4939
02:32:00,600 --> 02:32:01,040
Peek-a-boo!

4940
02:32:01,120 --> 02:32:01,260
Peek-a-boo!

4941
02:32:01,900 --> 02:32:02,340
Alright.

4942
02:32:03,100 --> 02:32:04,260
But not you, Dragoon.

4943
02:32:04,300 --> 02:32:04,680
It's not your chat.

4944
02:32:04,680 --> 02:32:05,720
This is the slowest speedrun.

4945
02:32:05,780 --> 02:32:06,620
What do you mean?

4946
02:32:08,760 --> 02:32:09,800
Dragoon, I don't mean you.

4947
02:32:15,410 --> 02:32:17,150
What chat are we talking about?

4948
02:32:19,350 --> 02:32:20,270
What are you trying to apply?

4949
02:32:20,530 --> 02:32:21,890
What are you trying to apply?

4950
02:32:22,210 --> 02:32:24,090
I think there's only two chats here.

4951
02:32:24,490 --> 02:32:25,830
Oh, brother is...

4952
02:32:26,410 --> 02:32:27,690
Brother comes after us.

4953
02:32:27,790 --> 02:32:28,690
Brother runs!

4954
02:32:30,990 --> 02:32:32,230
Brother walks here.

4955
02:32:32,330 --> 02:32:33,150
Oh my god, a miracle!

4956
02:32:33,310 --> 02:32:34,310
The second miracle!

4957
02:32:36,710 --> 02:32:38,110
What if he came to the door?

4958
02:32:38,250 --> 02:32:40,210
What if he was just like... He was trying to talk to us.

4959
02:32:40,250 --> 02:32:40,930
He was trying to communicate.

4960
02:32:40,990 --> 02:32:41,850
He was like, brothers...

4961
02:32:41,850 --> 02:32:43,950
Brothers, please, this is the worst time.

4962
02:32:44,010 --> 02:32:44,570
I'm sentient.

4963
02:32:46,070 --> 02:32:48,170
Brothers, I have something very important to tell you.

4964
02:32:48,950 --> 02:32:50,270
Oh, it's the footprints.

4965
02:32:50,450 --> 02:32:51,070
Oh, it's the footprints.

4966
02:32:51,190 --> 02:32:51,530
Alright.

4967
02:32:52,150 --> 02:32:54,690
This is the one time I can say whatever it is.

4968
02:32:54,730 --> 02:32:56,490
I've been keeping it in this entire time.

4969
02:32:57,950 --> 02:32:59,410
Oh my god, we're almost there.

4970
02:32:59,430 --> 02:32:59,870
Back to work.

4971
02:33:01,230 --> 02:33:04,110
We're still missing one more anomaly that we haven't seen before.

4972
02:33:05,150 --> 02:33:06,230
Because we got...

4973
02:33:07,630 --> 02:33:10,550
Because we were missing three and now we saw two of the new ones.

4974
02:33:11,370 --> 02:33:11,770
Yeah.

4975
02:33:12,170 --> 02:33:13,990
We need the... We're missing the...

4976
02:33:13,990 --> 02:33:14,930
This one's gonna be the faces.

4977
02:33:15,210 --> 02:33:15,970
Nope, nevermind.

4978
02:33:15,990 --> 02:33:16,250
Nope.

4979
02:33:16,570 --> 02:33:17,510
No urinals.

4980
02:33:18,730 --> 02:33:19,730
I don't see anything.

4981
02:33:19,890 --> 02:33:21,390
There's no hands coming out of the vents.

4982
02:33:22,550 --> 02:33:23,910
I don't see anything.

4983
02:33:23,910 --> 02:33:23,910
There's no hands coming out of the vents.

4984
02:33:24,030 --> 02:33:24,510
Nothing.

4985
02:33:24,890 --> 02:33:26,710
At least they don't make us count these.

4986
02:33:26,910 --> 02:33:27,550
Thank god.

4987
02:33:27,710 --> 02:33:27,910
I know.

4988
02:33:28,170 --> 02:33:29,690
I'm not paying attention.

4989
02:33:29,870 --> 02:33:31,890
I know it's all sixes, but I'm not paying attention.

4990
02:33:32,490 --> 02:33:32,590
I'm not paying attention.

4991
02:33:32,590 --> 02:33:32,590
I know it's all sixes, but I'm not paying attention.

4992
02:33:32,590 --> 02:33:33,330
Me neither.

4993
02:33:35,130 --> 02:33:35,610
Alright.

4994
02:33:35,610 --> 02:33:36,490
Okay, let's go.

4995
02:33:36,490 --> 02:33:37,310
4-13!

4996
02:33:39,550 --> 02:33:40,850
Back where we started!

4997
02:33:41,510 --> 02:33:41,530
Back where we started!

4998
02:33:42,750 --> 02:33:43,670
Yeah, you're right.

4999
02:33:44,570 --> 02:33:45,290
What's it saying?

5000
02:33:45,290 --> 02:33:45,990
Nice!

5001
02:33:46,550 --> 02:33:47,550
Nice, nice, nice.

5002
02:33:47,670 --> 02:33:49,170
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

5003
02:33:49,730 --> 02:33:50,670
What's this one?

5004
02:33:51,410 --> 02:33:52,230
No faces.

5005
02:33:52,510 --> 02:33:53,270
No faces.

5006
02:33:53,430 --> 02:33:53,990
No faces.

5007
02:33:53,990 --> 02:33:55,230
No blood in the urinals.

5008
02:33:55,350 --> 02:33:56,790
No hands coming out.

5009
02:33:57,870 --> 02:33:58,390
Uh...

5010
02:33:58,390 --> 02:33:59,190
There's nothing.

5011
02:33:59,830 --> 02:34:01,270
Another... No anomaly?

5012
02:34:02,350 --> 02:34:03,170
Two in a row?

5013
02:34:03,410 --> 02:34:04,150
Two in a row?

5014
02:34:04,290 --> 02:34:05,270
Two, four, six...

5015
02:34:05,270 --> 02:34:06,170
Come on, ghosts!

5016
02:34:06,270 --> 02:34:06,950
You're getting...

5017
02:34:06,950 --> 02:34:06,990
Come on!

5018
02:34:06,990 --> 02:34:09,090
You're getting a little lazy right now.

5019
02:34:09,110 --> 02:34:09,570
Lazy!

5020
02:34:09,570 --> 02:34:09,570
Yeah!

5021
02:34:10,010 --> 02:34:10,950
Come on!

5022
02:34:11,210 --> 02:34:11,930
Okay, whatever.

5023
02:34:11,930 --> 02:34:12,430
What is this?

5024
02:34:12,490 --> 02:34:14,150
We want an actual challenge.

5025
02:34:14,150 --> 02:34:14,690
This way?

5026
02:34:14,750 --> 02:34:16,690
This way, this way.

5027
02:34:21,930 --> 02:34:22,730
4-14!

5028
02:34:24,190 --> 02:34:26,150
The last three has to be the anomalies ones.

5029
02:34:26,270 --> 02:34:32,110
Because we're missing the faces, the hands coming out of the vent, and the blood in the urinals.

5030
02:34:32,470 --> 02:34:33,830
And the blood... Yeah, we're missing those three.

5031
02:34:33,990 --> 02:34:35,630
Okay, so, easy peasy.

5032
02:34:35,810 --> 02:34:36,730
We got this, guys.

5033
02:34:37,030 --> 02:34:38,030
Alright, which one is this?

5034
02:34:38,390 --> 02:34:38,790
Hands!

5035
02:34:39,130 --> 02:34:39,530
Hands!

5036
02:34:39,670 --> 02:34:39,910
Alright.

5037
02:34:40,850 --> 02:34:41,510
You know what?

5038
02:34:41,670 --> 02:34:42,090
We can...

5039
02:34:42,090 --> 02:34:43,530
I bet you, you won't risk it.

5040
02:34:43,630 --> 02:34:44,130
We stay in the...

5041
02:34:44,150 --> 02:34:45,130
elevator for the last three.

5042
02:34:47,610 --> 02:34:48,690
Stay in the elevator?

5043
02:34:48,930 --> 02:34:49,150
Oh, me?

5044
02:34:49,470 --> 02:34:50,050
No, no, no.

5045
02:34:50,390 --> 02:34:51,310
We press the buttons.

5046
02:34:51,350 --> 02:34:52,330
We don't even have to look at it.

5047
02:34:52,350 --> 02:34:53,730
Because the last two has to be anomalies.

5048
02:34:54,030 --> 02:34:54,810
You're a coward.

5049
02:34:55,110 --> 02:34:55,910
You're a coward.

5050
02:34:56,290 --> 02:34:57,470
What do you mean I'm a coward?

5051
02:34:57,530 --> 02:34:58,710
I wanted to go into the room!

5052
02:34:59,170 --> 02:34:59,530
You're a coward.

5053
02:34:59,530 --> 02:35:00,490
You know it's an anomaly!

5054
02:35:01,010 --> 02:35:02,470
You know it's an anomaly!

5055
02:35:02,790 --> 02:35:03,750
You even knew it!

5056
02:35:06,710 --> 02:35:07,770
Blood in the urinal.

5057
02:35:08,070 --> 02:35:08,770
I knew it.

5058
02:35:08,830 --> 02:35:09,830
The last one...

5059
02:35:09,830 --> 02:35:11,010
has to be the mirrors.

5060
02:35:11,930 --> 02:35:12,870
Okay, then you can check.

5061
02:35:13,050 --> 02:35:13,390
Alright.

5062
02:35:13,470 --> 02:35:14,270
No, I don't even need to check.

5063
02:35:14,270 --> 02:35:14,910
I'm gonna press the button.

5064
02:35:15,030 --> 02:35:15,230
It's too risky!

5065
02:35:16,550 --> 02:35:17,290
I'm gonna do it.

5066
02:35:17,910 --> 02:35:18,930
How much you wanna bet?

5067
02:35:18,990 --> 02:35:19,870
How much you wanna bet?

5068
02:35:19,930 --> 02:35:20,650
I will bet money.

5069
02:35:22,450 --> 02:35:24,350
I will bet an Akasupa.

5070
02:35:24,570 --> 02:35:25,570
I will bet an Akasupa.

5071
02:35:26,070 --> 02:35:27,490
Yo, you know I'm right!

5072
02:35:27,670 --> 02:35:29,050
You know I'm right!

5073
02:35:29,070 --> 02:35:29,970
You don't wanna bet!

5074
02:35:30,170 --> 02:35:31,410
You know I'm right!

5075
02:35:32,910 --> 02:35:33,490
You're wrong.

5076
02:35:34,930 --> 02:35:36,250
Why are you running back this way?

5077
02:35:36,350 --> 02:35:36,490
Why?

5078
02:35:39,010 --> 02:35:39,650
You're wrong.

5079
02:35:40,150 --> 02:35:40,870
You're wrong.

5080
02:35:41,790 --> 02:35:42,510
You're wrong.

5081
02:35:42,510 --> 02:35:43,250
That's why I'm smarty!

5082
02:35:43,250 --> 02:35:43,430
You're wrong.

5083
02:35:43,450 --> 02:35:45,330
That's why I'm smarty!

5084
02:35:46,370 --> 02:35:48,750
I'm gonna die immediately on this one.

5085
02:35:48,810 --> 02:35:49,430
So that...

5086
02:35:49,430 --> 02:35:51,170
Where are we?

5087
02:35:52,930 --> 02:35:54,390
Oh my god.

5088
02:35:54,670 --> 02:35:56,090
60 seconds in heaven.

5089
02:35:56,290 --> 02:35:57,910
Why is it so dark in there?

5090
02:35:58,210 --> 02:36:00,810
Oh no.

5091
02:36:01,090 --> 02:36:01,710
Oh no.

5092
02:36:02,730 --> 02:36:04,010
We gotta go downstairs.

5093
02:36:04,650 --> 02:36:05,750
We gotta go downstairs.

5094
02:36:05,750 --> 02:36:10,650
I think we broke her ankles.

5095
02:36:10,650 --> 02:36:12,850
I think we broke her ankles.

5096
02:36:13,110 --> 02:36:13,890
I think we broke her ankles.

5097
02:36:13,890 --> 02:36:15,670
Maybe we don't push each other then.

5098
02:36:16,250 --> 02:36:18,070
Maybe we can't actually.

5099
02:36:18,230 --> 02:36:19,010
You can't run?

5100
02:36:19,550 --> 02:36:21,150
You can't even run?

5101
02:36:21,390 --> 02:36:23,950
I fucking ran and I broke my ankle.

5102
02:36:23,950 --> 02:36:25,230
There's something like humming.

5103
02:36:26,150 --> 02:36:29,270
I like ran and I broke my ankle.

5104
02:36:30,090 --> 02:36:31,010
What happened?

5105
02:36:31,070 --> 02:36:32,150
You are weak bones.

5106
02:36:32,310 --> 02:36:33,090
What happened to you?

5107
02:36:33,370 --> 02:36:35,710
I was spraying with glass bones.

5108
02:36:35,710 --> 02:36:35,990
Oh my god.

5109
02:36:36,070 --> 02:36:36,470
Please.

5110
02:36:36,610 --> 02:36:37,470
God no.

5111
02:36:37,610 --> 02:36:37,910
Please.

5112
02:36:38,070 --> 02:36:39,230
Are you even watching?

5113
02:36:39,310 --> 02:36:40,190
Can you see what's happening?

5114
02:36:40,910 --> 02:36:43,230
I was pouring with glass bones.

5115
02:36:43,290 --> 02:36:44,310
There's a girl whispering.

5116
02:36:44,850 --> 02:36:46,750
Every breath I take...

5117
02:36:46,750 --> 02:36:47,990
is pain.

5118
02:36:48,910 --> 02:36:49,830
Shut up.

5119
02:36:49,910 --> 02:36:51,810
You weak willed woman.

5120
02:36:52,270 --> 02:36:53,270
Oh my god.

5121
02:36:53,470 --> 02:36:54,450
I'm so close.

5122
02:36:54,450 --> 02:36:55,470
I have bone-a-titis.

5123
02:36:55,570 --> 02:36:56,290
Do I just walk?

5124
02:36:56,570 --> 02:36:57,210
Oh my god.

5125
02:36:57,230 --> 02:36:57,370
Wait.

5126
02:36:57,410 --> 02:36:57,950
There's a face there.

5127
02:36:58,390 --> 02:36:59,090
There's a face?

5128
02:36:59,170 --> 02:36:59,470
Where?

5129
02:37:00,150 --> 02:37:01,030
Look at it.

5130
02:37:01,630 --> 02:37:04,390
It would be so funny if you look at it again.

5131
02:37:05,970 --> 02:37:07,990
Look at your face you liar.

5132
02:37:08,750 --> 02:37:09,590
Yes there is.

5133
02:37:10,650 --> 02:37:13,310
Why am I the only one that survives these?

5134
02:37:14,190 --> 02:37:17,670
I'm sorry my bones were made of glass.

5135
02:37:18,210 --> 02:37:18,770
I'm sorry my bones were made of glass.

5136
02:37:18,770 --> 02:37:21,830
You're gonna fucking bring up my medical history.

5137
02:37:22,810 --> 02:37:26,410
Your brother has been demoted to being a janitor.

5138
02:37:26,630 --> 02:37:27,370
He's a janitor.

5139
02:37:27,990 --> 02:37:30,110
This is always in here.

5140
02:37:30,150 --> 02:37:30,950
This little head bag.

5141
02:37:31,230 --> 02:37:32,690
They're throwing away body parts.

5142
02:37:33,030 --> 02:37:33,650
Oh yeah.

5143
02:37:33,850 --> 02:37:34,790
This little head bag.

5144
02:37:35,130 --> 02:37:36,930
Why are you throwing away body parts?

5145
02:37:37,150 --> 02:37:38,250
Okay I don't think...

5146
02:37:38,250 --> 02:37:40,410
There's so many caution wet.

5147
02:37:40,650 --> 02:37:42,010
Six brooms.

5148
02:37:42,030 --> 02:37:44,530
Six trash cans.

5149
02:37:45,050 --> 02:37:46,470
But there's only five sinks.

5150
02:37:47,070 --> 02:37:49,490
Oh I feel like that's gonna be an anomaly.

5151
02:37:49,670 --> 02:37:51,490
They're just gonna bring a six sink out of nowhere.

5152
02:37:51,890 --> 02:37:54,570
And there's five trash cans.

5153
02:37:55,010 --> 02:37:56,150
There's five trash cans?

5154
02:37:56,710 --> 02:37:58,530
Oh cause this is like floor 500.

5155
02:37:58,790 --> 02:37:59,790
We're so close.

5156
02:38:00,090 --> 02:38:00,590
Man.

5157
02:38:01,610 --> 02:38:04,890
We have 266 floors to go.

5158
02:38:05,430 --> 02:38:07,590
We're almost at the finish line.

5159
02:38:09,570 --> 02:38:10,630
I did not expect that.

5160
02:38:10,630 --> 02:38:12,570
I didn't expect this game to be like three hours long.

5161
02:38:12,750 --> 02:38:13,610
I didn't expect that.

5162
02:38:14,410 --> 02:38:16,450
Well you know if some...

5163
02:38:17,190 --> 02:38:18,350
chatters wouldn't...

5164
02:38:18,350 --> 02:38:20,190
you know... give us the wrong information.

5165
02:38:20,190 --> 02:38:21,330
Oh you're so right.

5166
02:38:21,550 --> 02:38:23,750
If some chatters didn't...

5167
02:38:24,710 --> 02:38:26,490
backseat us better.

5168
02:38:28,410 --> 02:38:29,050
Oh.

5169
02:38:29,150 --> 02:38:30,930
Oh god that actually...

5170
02:38:30,930 --> 02:38:32,730
That actually got me.

5171
02:38:32,750 --> 02:38:34,290
That actually got me.

5172
02:38:36,230 --> 02:38:36,870
Wait.

5173
02:38:36,870 --> 02:38:37,370
Wait.

5174
02:38:37,770 --> 02:38:38,870
That's the anomaly right?

5175
02:38:39,250 --> 02:38:40,530
It started us over.

5176
02:38:40,730 --> 02:38:41,510
No it's 501.

5177
02:38:42,450 --> 02:38:43,470
That's where we were at.

5178
02:38:43,770 --> 02:38:44,450
Yeah so we go up.

5179
02:38:44,570 --> 02:38:45,410
That was the anomaly.

5180
02:38:45,770 --> 02:38:46,670
Oh okay then go up.

5181
02:38:46,670 --> 02:38:46,950
Yeah.

5182
02:38:47,050 --> 02:38:47,850
That had to be.

5183
02:38:48,870 --> 02:38:49,270
That.

5184
02:38:49,310 --> 02:38:50,450
That kinda got me.

5185
02:38:50,490 --> 02:38:53,210
I was like I just got a new PC last week.

5186
02:38:53,270 --> 02:38:53,670
Like what do you mean?

5187
02:38:54,730 --> 02:38:55,570
What do you mean?

5188
02:38:55,910 --> 02:38:57,210
What do you mean?

5189
02:38:58,190 --> 02:38:59,610
And I saw 666.

5190
02:39:01,650 --> 02:39:03,250
Yeah you guys it's the dragoons.

5191
02:39:03,250 --> 02:39:03,730
It's not you.

5192
02:39:03,850 --> 02:39:04,890
Yeah you guys it's the wiz.

5193
02:39:04,950 --> 02:39:05,410
Don't worry.

5194
02:39:06,870 --> 02:39:08,170
It's always the wiz.

5195
02:39:09,110 --> 02:39:10,570
Go into the rooms.

5196
02:39:10,590 --> 02:39:11,690
Oh good.

5197
02:39:11,810 --> 02:39:12,130
Good.

5198
02:39:12,210 --> 02:39:12,610
Good.

5199
02:39:12,710 --> 02:39:13,850
It's both of us.

5200
02:39:14,390 --> 02:39:14,990
Oh.

5201
02:39:15,250 --> 02:39:15,850
Oh.

5202
02:39:16,050 --> 02:39:17,430
Brother help us.

5203
02:39:17,490 --> 02:39:17,810
Brother.

5204
02:39:18,370 --> 02:39:20,090
Brother protect us brother.

5205
02:39:20,130 --> 02:39:20,630
Brother please.

5206
02:39:21,010 --> 02:39:21,970
Go big.

5207
02:39:22,130 --> 02:39:22,250
Go.

5208
02:39:22,950 --> 02:39:23,550
Yeah.

5209
02:39:24,630 --> 02:39:25,230
It's Johnny.

5210
02:39:27,330 --> 02:39:29,170
Is he gonna break it down?

5211
02:39:29,570 --> 02:39:30,170
Johnny.

5212
02:39:42,010 --> 02:39:42,890
Okay that was good.

5213
02:39:43,090 --> 02:39:44,070
It's Johnny.

5214
02:39:47,710 --> 02:39:49,650
Yo that was so good.

5215
02:39:49,690 --> 02:39:50,090
That was good.

5216
02:39:50,210 --> 02:39:50,670
I like that.

5217
02:39:50,670 --> 02:39:53,590
It was the perfectly cut rectangle in the door.

5218
02:39:53,770 --> 02:39:54,010
Yeah.

5219
02:39:57,670 --> 02:39:58,610
Blender rectangle.

5220
02:40:01,870 --> 02:40:02,390
Delete.

5221
02:40:03,390 --> 02:40:04,530
Alright here we go.

5222
02:40:04,890 --> 02:40:04,990
Let's go.

5223
02:40:05,010 --> 02:40:07,290
I wonder what it would have looked like on the outside.

5224
02:40:08,810 --> 02:40:09,870
I know right.

5225
02:40:09,870 --> 02:40:11,370
I am pretty curious.

5226
02:40:11,910 --> 02:40:12,970
That was a good one.

5227
02:40:13,170 --> 02:40:13,850
That was a good one.

5228
02:40:13,910 --> 02:40:14,890
You know what Tess you got that.

5229
02:40:15,790 --> 02:40:17,610
You can have that one.

5230
02:40:17,930 --> 02:40:19,250
I don't think there's anything here.

5231
02:40:19,470 --> 02:40:20,470
I don't see any anomalies.

5232
02:40:21,430 --> 02:40:23,570
The bags all have one.

5233
02:40:23,730 --> 02:40:26,910
Check the signs if they say any other 666.

5234
02:40:27,410 --> 02:40:28,050
Oh yeah.

5235
02:40:28,290 --> 02:40:30,550
I feel like every floor has a 666 somewhere.

5236
02:40:30,730 --> 02:40:30,890
They do.

5237
02:40:31,530 --> 02:40:31,970
Sometimes.

5238
02:40:32,210 --> 02:40:32,810
Some place.

5239
02:40:32,950 --> 02:40:33,250
Somewhere.

5240
02:40:34,350 --> 02:40:34,790
666.

5241
02:40:36,070 --> 02:40:37,850
Have you been counting all of these?

5242
02:40:37,890 --> 02:40:38,870
They're all 5 right?

5243
02:40:38,890 --> 02:40:38,910
All 5.

5244
02:40:38,910 --> 02:40:39,250
They're all 5.

5245
02:40:39,870 --> 02:40:40,230
The 5th floor.

5246
02:40:40,430 --> 02:40:42,070
Or the 500th floor.

5247
02:40:42,290 --> 02:40:43,650
The dev is so funny.

5248
02:40:46,610 --> 02:40:47,690
Alright here we go.

5249
02:40:47,850 --> 02:40:49,590
Johnny goes in the square hole.

5250
02:40:49,630 --> 02:40:51,130
The Johnny goes.

5251
02:40:51,570 --> 02:40:53,650
Goes in the square hole.

5252
02:40:56,470 --> 02:40:57,550
Go on in.

5253
02:40:57,970 --> 02:40:58,550
Alright.

5254
02:40:58,650 --> 02:40:59,570
There's gotta be something in here.

5255
02:41:00,410 --> 02:41:00,990
Caution.

5256
02:41:04,550 --> 02:41:05,130
Nothing.

5257
02:41:05,690 --> 02:41:06,950
Nothing in the bag.

5258
02:41:07,010 --> 02:41:07,990
Is there always something in...

5259
02:41:07,990 --> 02:41:10,390
There's no 6's anywhere.

5260
02:41:11,430 --> 02:41:12,970
6's would be like in the trash can.

5261
02:41:13,170 --> 02:41:13,630
Something.

5262
02:41:14,010 --> 02:41:14,190
Yeah.

5263
02:41:14,250 --> 02:41:15,550
Like at the bottom of the trash can.

5264
02:41:15,550 --> 02:41:15,570
Yeah.

5265
02:41:15,570 --> 02:41:15,670
Yeah.

5266
02:41:15,710 --> 02:41:15,930
Yeah.

5267
02:41:15,930 --> 02:41:16,230
Somewhere.

5268
02:41:16,570 --> 02:41:18,570
I don't see any body parts coming out.

5269
02:41:18,670 --> 02:41:19,350
I think we're good.

5270
02:41:19,470 --> 02:41:20,630
I'm going on the other side.

5271
02:41:21,710 --> 02:41:22,190
Okay.

5272
02:41:23,310 --> 02:41:23,990
We're good.

5273
02:41:24,570 --> 02:41:25,390
Goodbye brother.

5274
02:41:25,650 --> 02:41:26,470
Where are you?

5275
02:41:27,250 --> 02:41:27,730
Oh.

5276
02:41:28,130 --> 02:41:29,850
You don't.

5277
02:41:29,850 --> 02:41:31,310
You never trust me.

5278
02:41:31,550 --> 02:41:32,270
You don't believe.

5279
02:41:32,390 --> 02:41:34,410
Even though I was right.

5280
02:41:34,710 --> 02:41:35,930
I was like the last 3 floors.

5281
02:41:35,930 --> 02:41:38,030
If we go to 500 I'm just saying.

5282
02:41:38,030 --> 02:41:40,950
The last 3 floors were anomalies.

5283
02:41:41,050 --> 02:41:42,670
And you didn't trust me.

5284
02:41:42,730 --> 02:41:43,590
You were like no.

5285
02:41:44,370 --> 02:41:48,030
You wouldn't even bet real money into it.

5286
02:41:48,050 --> 02:41:49,070
Cause you knew I was right.

5287
02:41:49,230 --> 02:41:51,430
You knew I was right.

5288
02:41:51,630 --> 02:41:53,090
I was just being cautious.

5289
02:41:53,410 --> 02:41:55,930
You know your head bobbles up and down when you run.

5290
02:41:56,390 --> 02:41:57,210
You know your head bobbles up and down when you run.

5291
02:41:57,210 --> 02:41:58,170
Like actual running.

5292
02:41:59,570 --> 02:42:00,170
Wait.

5293
02:42:00,250 --> 02:42:01,230
Something seems different.

5294
02:42:01,770 --> 02:42:02,330
Wait.

5295
02:42:02,330 --> 02:42:02,330
Something seems different.

5296
02:42:03,390 --> 02:42:03,990
No.

5297
02:42:04,130 --> 02:42:05,610
That's way too many.

5298
02:42:05,810 --> 02:42:06,430
Many plugs.

5299
02:42:06,590 --> 02:42:06,850
Right?

5300
02:42:06,870 --> 02:42:06,910
Yes.

5301
02:42:06,910 --> 02:42:07,150
Way.

5302
02:42:07,270 --> 02:42:08,010
I thought it was a plug.

5303
02:42:08,030 --> 02:42:09,450
I think that's way too many.

5304
02:42:10,070 --> 02:42:10,530
Oh.

5305
02:42:10,970 --> 02:42:11,810
There's 6 of everything.

5306
02:42:12,330 --> 02:42:14,010
There's 6 of everything suddenly.

5307
02:42:14,570 --> 02:42:15,490
Oh my god.

5308
02:42:15,490 --> 02:42:16,470
We returned to 4.

5309
02:42:17,310 --> 02:42:17,710
Oh my god.

5310
02:42:17,730 --> 02:42:18,070
You're right.

5311
02:42:18,270 --> 02:42:19,230
There's 6 of everything.

5312
02:42:19,850 --> 02:42:21,210
I like how you were like.

5313
02:42:21,510 --> 02:42:22,930
I like how you were like.

5314
02:42:23,110 --> 02:42:24,370
Look at the plugs.

5315
02:42:24,670 --> 02:42:25,970
I'm like looking at that.

5316
02:42:25,970 --> 02:42:27,030
Look at everything else.

5317
02:42:32,240 --> 02:42:33,160
Very prepared.

5318
02:42:33,260 --> 02:42:35,180
You focused on the fucking plugs.

5319
02:42:36,340 --> 02:42:37,040
I mean.

5320
02:42:37,100 --> 02:42:38,460
It's the first thing I saw.

5321
02:42:38,740 --> 02:42:39,360
I don't know.

5322
02:42:39,960 --> 02:42:40,440
I'm like.

5323
02:42:40,940 --> 02:42:43,860
I got the giant red fire hydrant.

5324
02:42:43,940 --> 02:42:44,780
It was just so many plugs.

5325
02:42:45,300 --> 02:42:45,700
Look.

5326
02:42:45,820 --> 02:42:47,640
They were covering the wall was the first thing I saw.

5327
02:42:47,740 --> 02:42:47,940
Oh.

5328
02:42:48,020 --> 02:42:48,540
There's a baby.

5329
02:42:49,120 --> 02:42:49,260
Oh.

5330
02:42:49,280 --> 02:42:49,680
There is a.

5331
02:42:53,080 --> 02:42:53,880
I'm dead.

5332
02:42:54,100 --> 02:42:54,740
I'm dead.

5333
02:42:55,740 --> 02:42:56,380
I'm dead.

5334
02:42:56,660 --> 02:42:57,760
I'm spectating.

5335
02:42:59,260 --> 02:43:00,940
The baby kills me.

5336
02:43:02,540 --> 02:43:03,320
Babies are dangerous.

5337
02:43:06,280 --> 02:43:07,540
Don't look at the baby.

5338
02:43:07,540 --> 02:43:08,640
The baby!

5339
02:43:08,640 --> 02:43:09,240
Don't look at the baby!

5340
02:43:09,640 --> 02:43:10,320
Don't look at the baby!

5341
02:43:10,340 --> 02:43:12,900
And you were judging me when I killed those two girls!

5342
02:43:13,320 --> 02:43:14,880
The baby killed me!

5343
02:43:14,980 --> 02:43:15,880
It should have killed you!

5344
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:17,900
I was protecting you, brother!

5345
02:43:18,160 --> 02:43:19,940
I was protecting you, brother!

5346
02:43:20,180 --> 02:43:21,300
Oh, brother's about to explode?

5347
02:43:21,500 --> 02:43:23,240
Oh my god, brother's a TNT?

5348
02:43:24,040 --> 02:43:24,520
No!

5349
02:43:31,480 --> 02:43:34,020
Oh my god, what the fuck?

5350
02:43:34,060 --> 02:43:34,900
Goodbye, brother.

5351
02:43:35,240 --> 02:43:36,120
Goodbye, brother.

5352
02:43:36,500 --> 02:43:38,200
He was a brother to me.

5353
02:43:43,440 --> 02:43:44,680
Brother was literally...

5354
02:43:44,680 --> 02:43:47,340
You know that meme of the guy sitting and he's like super bright?

5355
02:43:47,520 --> 02:43:50,100
That's why he's sitting in the little express drive?

5356
02:43:50,520 --> 02:43:52,060
Come inside!

5357
02:43:52,260 --> 02:43:53,240
What is wrong with you?

5358
02:43:53,300 --> 02:43:56,040
I was waiting for you to be inside first!

5359
02:43:56,460 --> 02:43:57,480
I was already inside!

5360
02:43:57,640 --> 02:43:58,220
No, you were not!

5361
02:43:58,880 --> 02:44:00,660
No, no, no.

5362
02:44:00,800 --> 02:44:01,460
Check my vibe!

5363
02:44:01,680 --> 02:44:02,500
Check my vibe!

5364
02:44:03,740 --> 02:44:04,540
Time stampers!

5365
02:44:04,940 --> 02:44:06,920
Time stampers!

5366
02:44:07,980 --> 02:44:09,420
I don't think there's anomalies here.

5367
02:44:10,740 --> 02:44:11,520
I'm pretty sure.

5368
02:44:12,080 --> 02:44:12,180
Yeah.

5369
02:44:12,920 --> 02:44:14,980
Wait, only four mobs?

5370
02:44:15,120 --> 02:44:16,980
I don't think the chat's fucking with us.

5371
02:44:19,320 --> 02:44:19,880
Nooooooo.

5372
02:44:21,060 --> 02:44:22,920
Five-oh-nine!

5373
02:44:23,460 --> 02:44:25,520
Five-oh-nine!

5374
02:44:25,520 --> 02:44:26,760
I knew it!

5375
02:44:26,760 --> 02:44:27,580
I knew that chat.

5376
02:44:27,640 --> 02:44:29,040
That was way too detailed.

5377
02:44:29,820 --> 02:44:32,580
Because a real chatter would be like...

5378
02:44:32,580 --> 02:44:33,300
Oh!

5379
02:44:33,300 --> 02:44:35,020
The head is moved.

5380
02:44:35,600 --> 02:44:36,320
You sure?

5381
02:44:37,260 --> 02:44:37,820
Yeah.

5382
02:44:38,020 --> 02:44:39,260
It's not moving now.

5383
02:44:39,580 --> 02:44:41,000
No, like they're in different positions.

5384
02:44:42,080 --> 02:44:42,520
Oh!

5385
02:44:42,560 --> 02:44:43,800
Are you sure?

5386
02:44:44,260 --> 02:44:45,960
Oh, you're right.

5387
02:44:46,060 --> 02:44:47,360
It's moved up closer.

5388
02:44:47,680 --> 02:44:48,080
You're right.

5389
02:44:48,120 --> 02:44:48,540
I see it.

5390
02:44:48,800 --> 02:44:49,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5391
02:44:50,680 --> 02:44:53,460
Chat, I know when you're lying because...

5392
02:44:53,460 --> 02:44:53,520
I'm so good.

5393
02:44:53,600 --> 02:44:56,420
I like find everything so quickly before Doki.

5394
02:44:56,760 --> 02:44:57,540
I'm sure.

5395
02:44:58,540 --> 02:45:01,260
Yeah, yeah, like the six plugs that you saw too.

5396
02:45:01,880 --> 02:45:04,180
And there were actually six plugs!

5397
02:45:04,480 --> 02:45:05,300
And there were actually six plugs!

5398
02:45:05,460 --> 02:45:07,740
I don't know why that's what you're so focused on.

5399
02:45:07,760 --> 02:45:08,040
I don't know why that's what you're so focused on.

5400
02:45:08,040 --> 02:45:08,300
WOOOOOO!

5401
02:45:09,920 --> 02:45:11,060
That's a lot of...

5402
02:45:11,060 --> 02:45:12,640
That was not six boxes.

5403
02:45:13,100 --> 02:45:13,920
How do we get out?

5404
02:45:14,720 --> 02:45:15,760
The collision!

5405
02:45:17,400 --> 02:45:18,400
I'll pinch you out!

5406
02:45:19,720 --> 02:45:21,440
I'm gonna punch you out!

5407
02:45:22,020 --> 02:45:23,140
I can't get out!

5408
02:45:23,740 --> 02:45:25,460
I'm trying to push through the wall!

5409
02:45:25,620 --> 02:45:26,860
I can't!

5410
02:45:26,900 --> 02:45:27,620
Push me!

5411
02:45:27,700 --> 02:45:28,480
No, I'm trying!

5412
02:45:29,520 --> 02:45:31,040
No, you're not doing anything!

5413
02:45:31,440 --> 02:45:32,420
What do you mean?

5414
02:45:32,960 --> 02:45:34,280
See, this is why we...

5415
02:45:35,020 --> 02:45:35,880
I got out!

5416
02:45:35,920 --> 02:45:36,280
I got out!

5417
02:45:36,360 --> 02:45:36,640
Come on!

5418
02:45:37,800 --> 02:45:39,040
Oh, it disappeared.

5419
02:45:39,200 --> 02:45:39,360
Okay.

5420
02:45:40,660 --> 02:45:41,100
Wow!

5421
02:45:41,100 --> 02:45:41,540
Wow!

5422
02:45:41,560 --> 02:45:42,740
You didn't even try!

5423
02:45:45,540 --> 02:45:49,660
See, this is why only one of us needed to go inside.

5424
02:45:50,060 --> 02:45:50,760
Oh my god!

5425
02:45:52,640 --> 02:45:56,240
If it was just one of us inside, we would not have to...

5426
02:45:56,240 --> 02:45:57,080
You still would have needed me!

5427
02:45:57,200 --> 02:45:59,020
Okay, you can go then this time.

5428
02:45:59,120 --> 02:46:00,920
I'm drinking my tea.

5429
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:01,280
Hold on.

5430
02:46:01,400 --> 02:46:02,640
Okay, you're drinking your tea.

5431
02:46:02,720 --> 02:46:03,160
I see.

5432
02:46:04,280 --> 02:46:05,580
I don't think there's anything here.

5433
02:46:08,500 --> 02:46:10,700
What are you laughing at?

5434
02:46:11,140 --> 02:46:12,200
I'm serious!

5435
02:46:12,320 --> 02:46:13,440
There's nothing here!

5436
02:46:14,100 --> 02:46:16,960
It's because you walk in for two seconds and you're like, Nothing here!

5437
02:46:17,180 --> 02:46:19,180
Because I have good memory!

5438
02:46:19,440 --> 02:46:20,440
Unlike somebody.

5439
02:46:21,720 --> 02:46:29,480
Who has gotten... Okay, I actually need chat to keep track of who has gotten the most things in this game.

5440
02:46:30,360 --> 02:46:31,580
Yeah, and they'll say me!

5441
02:46:32,220 --> 02:46:33,360
Wait, was there a mirror in that game?

5442
02:46:34,480 --> 02:46:36,440
There was a mirror in there!

5443
02:46:36,460 --> 02:46:37,700
I got gaslit.

5444
02:46:38,860 --> 02:46:40,300
Look, I'm gonna say...

5445
02:46:40,300 --> 02:46:41,640
You know when they're lying?

5446
02:46:41,840 --> 02:46:44,080
When they get extra detailed.

5447
02:46:44,400 --> 02:46:47,940
Because usually when they think they see an anomaly, they'll be like, mirror.

5448
02:46:48,280 --> 02:46:50,260
But then they said, face in the mirror.

5449
02:46:51,680 --> 02:46:53,680
I got one guide for real.

5450
02:46:54,180 --> 02:46:55,820
You got one guide.

5451
02:46:56,780 --> 02:46:57,300
Five!

5452
02:46:57,300 --> 02:46:57,820
Twelve!

5453
02:47:00,040 --> 02:47:01,140
Alright, here we go.

5454
02:47:01,140 --> 02:47:01,240
Here we go.

5455
02:47:03,100 --> 02:47:05,140
I hope it's no anomalies.

5456
02:47:05,940 --> 02:47:08,840
Guys, there's no way Doki would have gotten through this game without me.

5457
02:47:08,960 --> 02:47:13,620
Guys, I was so good at Exit 8.

5458
02:47:14,260 --> 02:47:14,740
Okay.

5459
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:16,660
I literally had a speedrun.

5460
02:47:16,980 --> 02:47:19,120
This is literally Exit 8, but multiplayer.

5461
02:47:19,620 --> 02:47:21,060
So I did that solo.

5462
02:47:21,640 --> 02:47:22,960
It's a different game.

5463
02:47:23,240 --> 02:47:24,900
This is literally Exit 8.

5464
02:47:25,020 --> 02:47:25,660
Oh, anomaly.

5465
02:47:25,920 --> 02:47:27,480
See, I found it before you.

5466
02:47:27,560 --> 02:47:28,960
I found it before you.

5467
02:47:29,080 --> 02:47:29,660
Look at that.

5468
02:47:31,140 --> 02:47:31,760
I didn't even see it.

5469
02:47:31,800 --> 02:47:34,140
If I said nothing and let you pick the pathway...

5470
02:47:34,140 --> 02:47:35,020
That was actually really good.

5471
02:47:36,200 --> 02:47:37,300
I'll give you that one.

5472
02:47:37,500 --> 02:47:38,500
You don't have to press the button though.

5473
02:47:38,880 --> 02:47:40,180
Which means I found it.

5474
02:47:40,580 --> 02:47:41,020
Wow!

5475
02:47:41,620 --> 02:47:43,120
What are these new rules?

5476
02:47:45,520 --> 02:47:49,840
She's definitely in kindergarten where they invent new rules just so they can win.

5477
02:47:54,240 --> 02:47:56,120
Yeah, you were blocking my view actually.

5478
02:47:56,160 --> 02:47:59,900
So I just couldn't see it because your pig head was in the way.

5479
02:48:00,680 --> 02:48:01,120
You didn't win.

5480
02:48:01,140 --> 02:48:03,640
I don't think there's anything.

5481
02:48:03,640 --> 02:48:04,860
I don't think so either.

5482
02:48:04,960 --> 02:48:05,420
No anomaly.

5483
02:48:07,800 --> 02:48:08,320
Yeah?

5484
02:48:08,420 --> 02:48:10,020
You don't believe me?

5485
02:48:10,380 --> 02:48:11,340
I'm just checking.

5486
02:48:11,600 --> 02:48:14,280
Oh, someone doesn't believe me.

5487
02:48:16,460 --> 02:48:18,280
Oh, you pressed the button?

5488
02:48:18,420 --> 02:48:18,660
Okay.

5489
02:48:19,820 --> 02:48:21,700
This is your choice for no anomaly.

5490
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:27,040
5, 4...

5491
02:48:27,040 --> 02:48:27,340
Oh!

5492
02:48:32,210 --> 02:48:33,750
You said it first.

5493
02:48:33,870 --> 02:48:35,470
You said it first.

5494
02:48:36,090 --> 02:48:37,530
You said it first.

5495
02:48:37,730 --> 02:48:38,830
You said it first.

5496
02:48:40,650 --> 02:48:41,850
Remember your rule.

5497
02:48:42,070 --> 02:48:43,290
Remember your rule.

5498
02:48:44,450 --> 02:48:45,830
Your fucking rule.

5499
02:48:47,530 --> 02:48:50,230
It means that you found the anomaly.

5500
02:48:55,200 --> 02:48:57,260
I don't think there's anything here.

5501
02:48:57,620 --> 02:48:59,280
Do you know why we messed up?

5502
02:48:59,380 --> 02:49:00,740
We went to the wrong elevator.

5503
02:49:05,620 --> 02:49:08,260
We went to the orange light.

5504
02:49:09,820 --> 02:49:12,520
No, we didn't.

5505
02:49:12,620 --> 02:49:14,100
No, we went to the other one, right?

5506
02:49:14,980 --> 02:49:18,280
No, we went back.

5507
02:49:20,200 --> 02:49:21,620
How does this happen?

5508
02:49:21,700 --> 02:49:22,620
That's what I'm telling you.

5509
02:49:22,620 --> 02:49:25,180
And the rules are too confusing for this game.

5510
02:49:26,800 --> 02:49:27,720
There's two rules.

5511
02:49:27,720 --> 02:49:29,760
The orange light needs to be more obvious.

5512
02:49:31,460 --> 02:49:33,000
There's two rules.

5513
02:49:33,680 --> 02:49:34,200
What?

5514
02:49:34,240 --> 02:49:34,300
There's two rules.

5515
02:49:34,300 --> 02:49:36,200
It needs to be more obvious.

5516
02:49:36,420 --> 02:49:37,480
I'm telling you.

5517
02:49:38,480 --> 02:49:43,260
How much more obvious do they need to be?

5518
02:49:43,300 --> 02:49:44,060
How much more obvious do they need to be?

5519
02:49:44,060 --> 02:49:47,020
The orange light needs to be like so bright.

5520
02:49:47,580 --> 02:49:48,100
The orange light needs to be like so bright.

5521
02:49:48,100 --> 02:49:48,700
The orange light needs to be like so bright.

5522
02:49:49,480 --> 02:49:51,580
They need signs.

5523
02:49:51,980 --> 02:49:56,160
They need signs where it just has like big like 50 font text.

5524
02:49:56,160 --> 02:49:57,700
It says you came here.

5525
02:49:57,780 --> 02:49:58,740
Impact font.

5526
02:50:00,040 --> 02:50:01,180
Anomaly here.

5527
02:50:01,180 --> 02:50:03,160
No anomaly here.

5528
02:50:04,520 --> 02:50:05,640
It's the bag heads.

5529
02:50:05,820 --> 02:50:06,220
It's the bag heads.

5530
02:50:10,800 --> 02:50:11,960
I found it.

5531
02:50:12,140 --> 02:50:13,200
I found it.

5532
02:50:14,840 --> 02:50:16,140
Yeah, put the...

5533
02:50:17,220 --> 02:50:21,380
The one we fucked up it was you who fucked up.

5534
02:50:21,440 --> 02:50:22,140
Not me.

5535
02:50:24,580 --> 02:50:27,060
Someone should stay outside for Johnny.

5536
02:50:27,100 --> 02:50:27,580
You're right.

5537
02:50:27,860 --> 02:50:30,940
Alright, I'll be outside.

5538
02:50:31,180 --> 02:50:32,900
I wanna see Johnny.

5539
02:50:33,500 --> 02:50:34,780
Rock, paper, scissors.

5540
02:50:35,280 --> 02:50:36,600
Rock, paper, scissors.

5541
02:50:38,080 --> 02:50:40,480
I think there's no anomaly here.

5542
02:50:40,480 --> 02:50:40,940
There's no anomaly.

5543
02:50:41,660 --> 02:50:42,960
Don't go that way.

5544
02:50:43,020 --> 02:50:48,900
I was just testing to see if it's like three in a row.

5545
02:50:51,420 --> 02:50:54,500
I can't believe we got... we were so close.

5546
02:50:54,620 --> 02:50:56,020
We were at 540.

5547
02:50:57,160 --> 02:50:58,480
We were so close.

5548
02:50:59,300 --> 02:50:59,600
It's the fifth floor.

5549
02:51:01,820 --> 02:51:06,920
This is why this game is gonna take us three plus hours.

5550
02:51:07,080 --> 02:51:08,080
This is why.

5551
02:51:10,820 --> 02:51:12,140
I don't think there's an anomaly.

5552
02:51:12,440 --> 02:51:13,420
Johnny, Johnny.

5553
02:51:13,780 --> 02:51:14,700
Johnny, Johnny.

5554
02:51:17,460 --> 02:51:19,960
You gotta wait for me.

5555
02:51:20,500 --> 02:51:20,820
No.

5556
02:51:20,860 --> 02:51:22,440
I was able to get out.

5557
02:51:22,540 --> 02:51:23,120
You can too.

5558
02:51:23,380 --> 02:51:23,800
Come on.

5559
02:51:24,260 --> 02:51:25,640
Push the boxes.

5560
02:51:25,800 --> 02:51:28,120
Go outside and push the boxes inwards.

5561
02:51:28,120 --> 02:51:30,280
I pushed them outwards.

5562
02:51:30,320 --> 02:51:31,040
You can do it too.

5563
02:51:31,100 --> 02:51:31,400
Come on.

5564
02:51:31,400 --> 02:51:32,380
Just use your legs.

5565
02:51:32,520 --> 02:51:34,260
What do you mean I'm using... I'm too tall.

5566
02:51:34,380 --> 02:51:36,540
I'm sorry for being six foot seven.

5567
02:51:39,100 --> 02:51:40,640
Says on my Tinder profile.

5568
02:51:40,740 --> 02:51:41,760
Six foot seven.

5569
02:51:42,780 --> 02:51:45,580
Well, I'm gonna wait in the elevator for your lazy ass.

5570
02:51:45,800 --> 02:51:46,800
Okay, it's gone.

5571
02:51:48,200 --> 02:51:49,560
Alright, here I am.

5572
02:51:49,820 --> 02:51:50,580
Oh my god.

5573
02:51:51,180 --> 02:51:52,380
I'm getting there.

5574
02:51:53,940 --> 02:51:57,700
I'm going as fast as my six foot seven legs start taking me.

5575
02:51:57,780 --> 02:51:59,280
You have really short legs.

5576
02:51:59,340 --> 02:52:00,960
You have the widest torso in history.

5577
02:52:04,300 --> 02:52:04,820
Five.

5578
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:05,640
Oh, fuck.

5579
02:52:07,100 --> 02:52:08,220
Eight more to go.

5580
02:52:09,940 --> 02:52:12,640
Why is it always on thirteen that we mess up?

5581
02:52:12,800 --> 02:52:13,140
I know.

5582
02:52:13,500 --> 02:52:15,840
I mean, thirteen is an unlucky number.

5583
02:52:16,920 --> 02:52:18,840
It's a TNT brother.

5584
02:52:19,160 --> 02:52:20,080
It's TNT brother.

5585
02:52:20,240 --> 02:52:21,740
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

5586
02:52:23,160 --> 02:52:24,040
Please, brother.

5587
02:52:24,440 --> 02:52:25,540
Think of your children.

5588
02:52:29,020 --> 02:52:29,460
Oh.

5589
02:52:30,360 --> 02:52:31,480
Alright, here we go.

5590
02:52:31,640 --> 02:52:33,280
We went to the correct elevator.

5591
02:52:33,900 --> 02:52:34,340
Is he a creeper?

5592
02:52:34,340 --> 02:52:35,280
Yeah, he's a creeper.

5593
02:52:37,160 --> 02:52:38,640
Don't call our brother a creep.

5594
02:52:38,700 --> 02:52:39,480
What's wrong with you?

5595
02:52:39,480 --> 02:52:40,740
Oh my god, what are you talking about?

5596
02:52:40,960 --> 02:52:41,840
He has children.

5597
02:52:42,980 --> 02:52:44,780
That doesn't make him a creep at all.

5598
02:52:45,580 --> 02:52:46,620
That makes him...

5599
02:52:47,660 --> 02:52:49,660
Alright, I don't think there's any anomaly here.

5600
02:52:50,920 --> 02:52:52,320
I don't think so either.

5601
02:52:52,720 --> 02:52:53,340
There's no smileys.

5602
02:52:53,340 --> 02:52:54,360
Unless there's a new one.

5603
02:52:54,860 --> 02:52:55,500
Oh, that's true.

5604
02:52:55,560 --> 02:52:55,920
We didn't...

5605
02:52:56,280 --> 02:52:57,080
Think of new ones.

5606
02:52:57,360 --> 02:52:59,340
I think in general it doesn't.

5607
02:52:59,340 --> 02:53:00,300
There's no anomalies.

5608
02:53:00,660 --> 02:53:02,700
Wait, wait, wait.

5609
02:53:02,820 --> 02:53:03,300
Anomaly.

5610
02:53:03,560 --> 02:53:04,380
Oh, anomaly!

5611
02:53:04,560 --> 02:53:05,820
The six, six, six.

5612
02:53:05,820 --> 02:53:06,480
I knew it.

5613
02:53:06,480 --> 02:53:07,860
I knew the six would come back.

5614
02:53:08,120 --> 02:53:09,060
I knew it.

5615
02:53:09,080 --> 02:53:09,220
See?

5616
02:53:09,520 --> 02:53:12,160
Guys, remember the competition that Mint proposed?

5617
02:53:12,400 --> 02:53:16,700
Where whoever catches the most anomalies wins?

5618
02:53:17,320 --> 02:53:17,640
What?

5619
02:53:17,640 --> 02:53:18,200
What competition?

5620
02:53:18,540 --> 02:53:20,100
I just said who has the most.

5621
02:53:20,260 --> 02:53:23,100
This competition that Mint really wanted to do.

5622
02:53:23,180 --> 02:53:25,000
Where she was like, Oh guys, time's up.

5623
02:53:25,100 --> 02:53:27,140
Every time, like, whoever picks the...

5624
02:53:27,140 --> 02:53:27,500
Okay.

5625
02:53:28,800 --> 02:53:31,460
Okay, but I'm still winning.

5626
02:53:32,500 --> 02:53:33,060
Sure.

5627
02:53:33,120 --> 02:53:35,780
In your dreams, I guess.

5628
02:53:37,100 --> 02:53:39,260
I like how you don't even walk inside.

5629
02:53:39,500 --> 02:53:40,980
No, because we wanted to see Johnny.

5630
02:53:41,540 --> 02:53:42,260
Oh yeah.

5631
02:53:42,300 --> 02:53:42,680
Remember?

5632
02:53:43,040 --> 02:53:45,160
How could you forget about Johnny?

5633
02:53:45,320 --> 02:53:47,020
He's been there for us.

5634
02:53:47,320 --> 02:53:47,880
Yes, Papa.

5635
02:53:47,880 --> 02:53:48,220
Yes, Papa.

5636
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:50,460
I don't think there's anomalies.

5637
02:53:50,740 --> 02:53:51,520
I don't think so either.

5638
02:53:51,520 --> 02:53:52,840
Alright, here we go.

5639
02:53:52,980 --> 02:53:52,980
Yay!

5640
02:53:52,980 --> 02:53:54,140
Finally the closer one.

5641
02:53:56,600 --> 02:53:56,980
Yay!

5642
02:53:57,100 --> 02:53:58,420
Every time there's like, ba-dum.

5643
02:53:58,600 --> 02:54:00,060
I feel like we're gonna get in there.

5644
02:54:00,160 --> 02:54:01,480
Wait, people are saying... Oh, we missed it.

5645
02:54:01,860 --> 02:54:02,780
Wait, what was there?

5646
02:54:03,360 --> 02:54:03,740
Huh?

5647
02:54:05,820 --> 02:54:06,200
Oh.

5648
02:54:06,200 --> 02:54:06,840
That was you.

5649
02:54:06,860 --> 02:54:07,380
You called it.

5650
02:54:07,780 --> 02:54:08,520
No, I didn't!

5651
02:54:08,540 --> 02:54:08,840
That was you.

5652
02:54:08,880 --> 02:54:09,420
You called it.

5653
02:54:09,440 --> 02:54:10,040
You called it.

5654
02:54:10,100 --> 02:54:11,020
You called it.

5655
02:54:11,020 --> 02:54:11,620
You called it.

5656
02:54:11,660 --> 02:54:12,360
You called it.

5657
02:54:12,360 --> 02:54:12,860
You called it.

5658
02:54:13,020 --> 02:54:16,380
We're gonna be stuck at 4,500 forever!

5659
02:54:17,140 --> 02:54:18,680
The door was backwards?

5660
02:54:18,840 --> 02:54:21,440
Wait, how... What do you mean the door was... How can a door be back?

5661
02:54:21,520 --> 02:54:21,980
Backwards!

5662
02:54:22,700 --> 02:54:25,120
Okay, this is the normal one, remember?

5663
02:54:25,300 --> 02:54:26,360
Oh yeah, this is the... Yeah, that's right.

5664
02:54:26,480 --> 02:54:30,340
We're gonna be stuck at floor 500!

5665
02:54:38,920 --> 02:54:41,440
I could tell you were hydrating before the cry.

5666
02:54:43,740 --> 02:54:45,340
Oh, it's on the wrong hinges.

5667
02:54:45,520 --> 02:54:47,080
Oh my god, so that's something else we have to...

5668
02:54:47,080 --> 02:54:49,520
We have to keep track of the wrong hinges?

5669
02:54:49,520 --> 02:54:50,980
So right now... Oh no.

5670
02:54:51,060 --> 02:54:51,700
Yeah, right now.

5671
02:54:51,860 --> 02:54:52,180
Yeah, right now.

5672
02:54:52,200 --> 02:54:53,060
Oh, it's backwards.

5673
02:54:53,500 --> 02:54:54,080
It's backwards.

5674
02:54:54,160 --> 02:54:54,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5675
02:54:54,980 --> 02:54:56,320
Oh good, we got it out of the way.

5676
02:54:56,420 --> 02:54:57,600
Yeah, we got that out of the way.

5677
02:54:57,660 --> 02:54:59,020
That is such a sneaky one.

5678
02:54:59,180 --> 02:55:02,440
That should have been a floor 516 one right there.

5679
02:55:08,190 --> 02:55:08,910
Not stupid!

5680
02:55:09,370 --> 02:55:10,690
People miss that too!

5681
02:55:11,790 --> 02:55:13,910
Yeah, everyone has probably missed that in their lives.

5682
02:55:13,930 --> 02:55:14,550
Yeah, everybody.

5683
02:55:14,710 --> 02:55:16,670
Those who called it out has played this game before.

5684
02:55:16,750 --> 02:55:17,290
I could tell.

5685
02:55:20,350 --> 02:55:20,710
Johnny?

5686
02:55:20,710 --> 02:55:21,350
Johnny?

5687
02:55:21,470 --> 02:55:22,130
Yes, Papa?

5688
02:55:22,370 --> 02:55:24,110
Oh, it's all the plugs.

5689
02:55:24,290 --> 02:55:25,010
All the plugs?

5690
02:55:25,250 --> 02:55:26,110
Oh yeah, it's the...

5691
02:55:26,950 --> 02:55:27,950
All the plugs.

5692
02:55:28,570 --> 02:55:30,750
We're stuck in 500 forever.

5693
02:55:30,930 --> 02:55:32,650
We'll never get to 666.

5694
02:55:32,650 --> 02:55:33,570
He was right!

5695
02:55:33,850 --> 02:55:35,150
The dev was right!

5696
02:55:35,230 --> 02:55:36,830
We will never get to 666!

5697
02:55:37,230 --> 02:55:37,730
We'll never get to 666!

5698
02:55:38,250 --> 02:55:39,890
We're stuck here forever!

5699
02:55:40,990 --> 02:55:42,170
It's Chad's fault.

5700
02:55:42,170 --> 02:55:43,370
They warned us soon enough.

5701
02:55:43,910 --> 02:55:45,850
They could have yelled at us.

5702
02:55:46,110 --> 02:55:47,110
They really could have.

5703
02:55:47,150 --> 02:55:49,550
They could have screamed if they knew it instantly.

5704
02:55:50,710 --> 02:55:59,850
I was gonna say, I was gonna say, I was gonna say, I was gonna say, I was gonna say, Come on!

5705
02:56:00,050 --> 02:56:00,930
Come on, Min!

5706
02:56:01,150 --> 02:56:01,810
Get over here!

5707
02:56:02,050 --> 02:56:02,170
I'm coming!

5708
02:56:02,350 --> 02:56:02,970
I'm coming!

5709
02:56:03,250 --> 02:56:03,950
I'm coming!

5710
02:56:04,470 --> 02:56:05,070
I'm coming!

5711
02:56:09,570 --> 02:56:11,050
Don't push me back any further!

5712
02:56:13,330 --> 02:56:14,270
Oh, look at me!

5713
02:56:14,330 --> 02:56:17,550
I actually got out, so it was clearly just a skill issue for you.

5714
02:56:17,730 --> 02:56:20,070
Oh yeah, it's not like I helped you get there.

5715
02:56:20,250 --> 02:56:20,690
Oh yeah, it's not like I helped you get there.

5716
02:56:20,710 --> 02:56:21,230
Look out!

5717
02:56:21,270 --> 02:56:22,330
You punched me out!

5718
02:56:22,490 --> 02:56:24,510
I don't know what you're talking about.

5719
02:56:24,750 --> 02:56:26,910
I helped you get there.

5720
02:56:28,450 --> 02:56:32,150
Guys, guys, if you guys see any anomalies, make sure to...

5721
02:56:35,030 --> 02:56:37,010
We will totally see.

5722
02:56:37,090 --> 02:56:37,650
We will see it.

5723
02:56:37,650 --> 02:56:39,050
And we won't miss it at all.

5724
02:56:39,430 --> 02:56:39,770
Yeah.

5725
02:56:42,910 --> 02:56:44,410
There's no sixes.

5726
02:56:44,490 --> 02:56:45,950
I think there's no anomalies.

5727
02:56:45,950 --> 02:56:48,030
Guys, this is your chance right now.

5728
02:56:48,030 --> 02:56:49,350
We're saying there's no anomalies.

5729
02:56:49,430 --> 02:56:51,130
This is your chance.

5730
02:56:51,310 --> 02:56:53,450
I'm gonna look at everything really slowly.

5731
02:56:53,570 --> 02:56:54,610
I'm gonna look at everything really slowly.

5732
02:56:54,910 --> 02:56:57,410
We're gonna look at this really slowly.

5733
02:56:57,450 --> 02:56:58,830
No anomalies.

5734
02:56:59,070 --> 02:57:02,010
If there was an anomaly, it's not our fault.

5735
02:57:02,070 --> 02:57:03,230
We gave you a chance.

5736
02:57:04,190 --> 02:57:04,950
No help.

5737
02:57:06,490 --> 02:57:07,370
No help.

5738
02:57:07,490 --> 02:57:07,970
No help.

5739
02:57:09,130 --> 02:57:10,050
Alright, here we go.

5740
02:57:10,150 --> 02:57:10,710
Up we go.

5741
02:57:12,450 --> 02:57:13,430
Up we go.

5742
02:57:13,710 --> 02:57:13,870
Bing!

5743
02:57:16,030 --> 02:57:16,470
505!

5744
02:57:19,350 --> 02:57:19,870
Johnny?

5745
02:57:19,910 --> 02:57:20,350
Johnny?

5746
02:57:20,370 --> 02:57:20,770
Johnny?

5747
02:57:22,890 --> 02:57:25,710
What if we both have to be inside though?

5748
02:57:26,130 --> 02:57:27,290
No, I don't think so.

5749
02:57:28,230 --> 02:57:29,770
Because what if it's a solo?

5750
02:57:29,870 --> 02:57:30,530
Single player?

5751
02:57:31,410 --> 02:57:32,990
A single player, it wouldn't matter.

5752
02:57:33,890 --> 02:57:35,490
Yeah, because they would be inside.

5753
02:57:36,270 --> 02:57:37,090
No, wait, what?

5754
02:57:37,250 --> 02:57:37,650
Oh yeah!

5755
02:57:41,350 --> 02:57:42,390
Okay, okay.

5756
02:57:45,810 --> 02:57:46,850
No anomalies.

5757
02:57:46,930 --> 02:57:48,010
No anomalies.

5758
02:57:48,030 --> 02:57:49,670
No, we have to go to the further one.

5759
02:57:49,910 --> 02:57:50,150
No!

5760
02:57:50,510 --> 02:57:52,530
Maybe it'll give us back to back no anomalies.

5761
02:57:52,910 --> 02:57:54,150
She's an actual bird.

5762
02:57:58,710 --> 02:58:00,770
What does that say about you, huh?

5763
02:58:00,930 --> 02:58:02,110
You messed up too.

5764
02:58:02,290 --> 02:58:03,910
You have no excuse for messing up.

5765
02:58:03,990 --> 02:58:04,470
Not as much as you.

5766
02:58:04,590 --> 02:58:06,370
At least people can say I'm a bird brain.

5767
02:58:06,510 --> 02:58:07,390
What about you then?

5768
02:58:07,930 --> 02:58:08,630
I'm dead.

5769
02:58:08,790 --> 02:58:09,550
I have like...

5770
02:58:09,550 --> 02:58:10,870
My brain is ectoplasm.

5771
02:58:11,090 --> 02:58:12,630
Your brain is...

5772
02:58:12,630 --> 02:58:14,050
It's literal mush, okay?

5773
02:58:15,590 --> 02:58:16,390
Oh, smileys.

5774
02:58:16,950 --> 02:58:17,550
Smileys, okay.

5775
02:58:17,610 --> 02:58:19,490
Back to the long one we go.

5776
02:58:19,850 --> 02:58:20,890
Back to the long one we go.

5777
02:58:20,890 --> 02:58:21,990
Don't worry, I'll speed you up.

5778
02:58:22,070 --> 02:58:23,090
I'm gonna speed you up.

5779
02:58:23,530 --> 02:58:24,950
Actually, you're really not doing anything.

5780
02:58:29,830 --> 02:58:31,370
It's like I'm getting a massage.

5781
02:58:32,590 --> 02:58:35,010
I'm a chiropractor, not licensed.

5782
02:58:37,910 --> 02:58:38,310
Alright.

5783
02:58:39,770 --> 02:58:40,350
Next one.

5784
02:58:40,410 --> 02:58:43,550
Guys, we're so close to 513 again.

5785
02:58:44,670 --> 02:58:46,130
We're gonna make it.

5786
02:58:46,510 --> 02:58:47,570
Are we that close?

5787
02:58:47,710 --> 02:58:48,650
I don't know.

5788
02:58:49,770 --> 02:58:51,170
Oh, the trash bags.

5789
02:58:51,930 --> 02:58:52,490
It's the bags.

5790
02:58:54,730 --> 02:58:55,590
It's the bags.

5791
02:58:55,810 --> 02:58:58,810
At least the shoes running is kind of ASMR.

5792
02:58:59,270 --> 02:58:59,370
At least the shoes running is kind of ASMR.

5793
02:58:59,370 --> 02:58:59,870
Yeah, it is.

5794
02:59:00,090 --> 02:59:04,410
You know, when it says hospital 666, I honestly thought the 6 was a joke.

5795
02:59:05,030 --> 02:59:05,150
You know, when it says hospital 666, I honestly thought the 6 was a joke.

5796
02:59:05,150 --> 02:59:07,690
Wait, so do we get to like...

5797
02:59:07,690 --> 02:59:08,290
What happens?

5798
02:59:08,330 --> 02:59:09,590
Do we get to just floor 6?

5799
02:59:09,990 --> 02:59:11,370
No, it's 666.

5800
02:59:11,510 --> 02:59:12,730
So it could be like 613.

5801
02:59:13,550 --> 02:59:14,110
616, 615.

5802
02:59:14,570 --> 02:59:17,390
And then all the way to 666 at the end.

5803
02:59:17,770 --> 02:59:18,290
Okay.

5804
02:59:18,650 --> 02:59:19,010
Alright.

5805
02:59:20,630 --> 02:59:21,150
Johnny.

5806
02:59:21,570 --> 02:59:22,190
No Johnny.

5807
02:59:22,470 --> 02:59:23,530
Oh, it's the 666.

5808
02:59:23,790 --> 02:59:27,050
Back to the long hallway we go.

5809
02:59:27,050 --> 02:59:28,750
You didn't even go into the room.

5810
02:59:28,990 --> 02:59:29,970
Cause we're gonna see the Johnny.

5811
02:59:30,190 --> 02:59:30,810
What do you mean?

5812
02:59:30,810 --> 02:59:32,430
Yeah, but what if you have to come inside?

5813
02:59:32,570 --> 02:59:34,070
What if we have to go inside?

5814
02:59:34,170 --> 02:59:35,290
I would have gone inside.

5815
02:59:35,410 --> 02:59:37,390
To see if we triggered the Johnny.

5816
02:59:39,450 --> 02:59:40,490
The Johnny.

5817
02:59:40,930 --> 02:59:41,830
That Johnny.

5818
02:59:41,890 --> 02:59:42,730
That silly guy.

5819
02:59:43,590 --> 02:59:44,030
I know.

5820
02:59:44,370 --> 02:59:45,850
I wanna see him too though.

5821
02:59:46,230 --> 02:59:47,410
Alright, I'll go inside.

5822
02:59:47,670 --> 02:59:48,850
We'll do Russian Roulette again.

5823
02:59:49,110 --> 02:59:51,370
Alright, one of us has to get the baby.

5824
02:59:51,470 --> 02:59:52,190
And the other one gets Johnny.

5825
02:59:54,050 --> 02:59:55,450
It pushed me inside!

5826
02:59:55,570 --> 02:59:55,930
It pushed you inside!

5827
02:59:56,370 --> 02:59:59,970
We get the POV of Johnny again!

5828
03:00:00,470 --> 03:00:01,190
Front row seats!

5829
03:00:02,430 --> 03:00:03,630
I'm gonna get really close to him.

5830
03:00:03,630 --> 03:00:04,030
Yeah, Johnny.

5831
03:00:04,130 --> 03:00:04,930
We wanna see you.

5832
03:00:05,050 --> 03:00:06,250
We wanna see your face.

5833
03:00:06,830 --> 03:00:07,270
Wow!

5834
03:00:08,730 --> 03:00:09,170
Wow!

5835
03:00:09,170 --> 03:00:09,990
Wow!

5836
03:00:11,510 --> 03:00:12,750
There's Johnny.

5837
03:00:16,790 --> 03:00:18,430
There he is.

5838
03:00:19,450 --> 03:00:20,690
There's Johnny.

5839
03:00:22,410 --> 03:00:23,750
I like how it grew a little.

5840
03:00:23,750 --> 03:00:24,710
Sounds like Freddy Fazbear.

5841
03:00:25,290 --> 03:00:33,650
There's Johnny.

5842
03:00:34,880 --> 03:00:36,410
Someone asked to sit with me.

5843
03:00:36,490 --> 03:00:38,030
And said I see an anomaly.

5844
03:00:42,490 --> 03:00:43,410
Oh my gosh.

5845
03:00:43,470 --> 03:00:43,650
Oh my gosh.

5846
03:00:43,650 --> 03:00:44,170
Thank you.

5847
03:00:44,870 --> 03:00:45,670
Thank you.

5848
03:00:45,730 --> 03:00:47,310
I never would have gotten...

5849
03:00:47,310 --> 03:00:48,450
Brothers on fire.

5850
03:00:48,650 --> 03:00:52,430
Why is it always the long one with brothers on fire?

5851
03:00:53,010 --> 03:00:53,350
I don't know.

5852
03:01:02,270 --> 03:01:04,350
This game is breaking us.

5853
03:01:05,470 --> 03:01:06,750
We didn't think...

5854
03:01:06,750 --> 03:01:08,710
We didn't realize when they said 666.

5855
03:01:08,890 --> 03:01:10,830
It was literally 666.

5856
03:01:11,570 --> 03:01:12,350
6 hours.

5857
03:01:13,070 --> 03:01:14,070
6 hours.

5858
03:01:14,330 --> 03:01:16,590
Remember when we said 24 hour stream?

5859
03:01:16,690 --> 03:01:17,970
We were not joking.

5860
03:01:18,590 --> 03:01:19,850
We meant it.

5861
03:01:20,730 --> 03:01:21,650
Oh, it's the baby.

5862
03:01:21,830 --> 03:01:23,410
It's the killer baby.

5863
03:01:23,510 --> 03:01:24,230
I went the wrong way.

5864
03:01:26,470 --> 03:01:27,730
Push me faster.

5865
03:01:28,330 --> 03:01:28,910
The baby.

5866
03:01:29,410 --> 03:01:30,870
I think we didn't look at the baby.

5867
03:01:30,950 --> 03:01:31,890
So the baby's not coming.

5868
03:01:31,890 --> 03:01:32,670
Yeah.

5869
03:01:32,830 --> 03:01:33,630
Yeah, that's good.

5870
03:01:33,950 --> 03:01:35,490
Stupid baby.

5871
03:01:36,630 --> 03:01:37,910
That's why you're a baby.

5872
03:01:38,050 --> 03:01:40,110
You should have died by the baby.

5873
03:01:40,170 --> 03:01:42,110
Why was I supposed to die by the baby?

5874
03:01:42,230 --> 03:01:44,030
Because I died from the baby last time.

5875
03:01:44,370 --> 03:01:45,210
Yeah, but you're stupid.

5876
03:01:48,050 --> 03:01:50,870
Yeah, because totally I knew that looking at a baby would kill me.

5877
03:01:51,330 --> 03:01:53,290
I told you I'm not ready to be a mother.

5878
03:01:54,630 --> 03:01:55,430
I told you I'm not ready to be a mother.

5879
03:01:55,430 --> 03:01:57,750
I saw that Tokyo Jungle play through.

5880
03:01:57,910 --> 03:01:58,090
I saw that Tokyo Jungle play through.

5881
03:01:58,090 --> 03:02:00,230
You were so ready to be a mother.

5882
03:02:03,710 --> 03:02:05,070
You should play that game.

5883
03:02:05,350 --> 03:02:06,150
You should play that game.

5884
03:02:06,150 --> 03:02:06,930
You should build...

5885
03:02:06,930 --> 03:02:10,490
You told me that I killed your little birdies.

5886
03:02:10,970 --> 03:02:10,990
You should build...

5887
03:02:10,990 --> 03:02:10,990
You told me that I killed your little birdies.

5888
03:02:10,990 --> 03:02:11,810
Was there anomaly?

5889
03:02:13,870 --> 03:02:14,410
Anomalies?

5890
03:02:14,650 --> 03:02:15,050
Yes.

5891
03:02:16,410 --> 03:02:18,090
Why are you just standing back there?

5892
03:02:18,170 --> 03:02:19,510
Because there was no anomaly.

5893
03:02:19,670 --> 03:02:20,310
What are you doing?

5894
03:02:20,590 --> 03:02:22,230
Oh my god.

5895
03:02:22,350 --> 03:02:23,730
Oh my god.

5896
03:02:24,130 --> 03:02:27,830
I almost did it.

5897
03:02:27,870 --> 03:02:29,390
What are you doing?

5898
03:02:32,750 --> 03:02:33,570
I almost did it.

5899
03:02:33,570 --> 03:02:34,410
There was no Akasupa.

5900
03:02:34,510 --> 03:02:35,550
So she couldn't tell, guys.

5901
03:02:35,850 --> 03:02:36,890
I know, you guys.

5902
03:02:36,930 --> 03:02:40,150
I was the Akasupa, but I did it for free.

5903
03:02:40,610 --> 03:02:42,150
The way you were standing there...

5904
03:02:42,150 --> 03:02:44,110
It was so menacing.

5905
03:02:45,650 --> 03:02:47,110
What haven't we gotten?

5906
03:02:47,470 --> 03:02:48,990
I was like, what is she doing?

5907
03:02:49,690 --> 03:02:50,310
No way.

5908
03:02:50,450 --> 03:02:51,990
There has to be an anomaly in here.

5909
03:02:52,250 --> 03:02:52,750
There's no anomaly.

5910
03:02:54,030 --> 03:02:57,310
Guys, we're waiting for the Akasupa right now.

5911
03:02:57,530 --> 03:02:58,330
Guys, we're waiting for the Akasupa right now.

5912
03:02:58,330 --> 03:02:59,550
Wait, there's something on the floor.

5913
03:03:00,230 --> 03:03:01,370
Is it?

5914
03:03:01,370 --> 03:03:02,830
Yeah, it's a face on the floor.

5915
03:03:02,850 --> 03:03:04,890
Oh shit, it's Salad Fingers.

5916
03:03:08,910 --> 03:03:10,410
We got something new.

5917
03:03:10,790 --> 03:03:12,650
We're going past 513.

5918
03:03:13,630 --> 03:03:15,110
We went past it.

5919
03:03:15,290 --> 03:03:15,710
Yay!

5920
03:03:15,790 --> 03:03:16,590
New record.

5921
03:03:18,050 --> 03:03:19,070
Salad Fingers.

5922
03:03:19,930 --> 03:03:22,730
God, first Doctor Horrible.

5923
03:03:24,130 --> 03:03:25,570
What does it say about you?

5924
03:03:25,630 --> 03:03:27,170
You recognize these references.

5925
03:03:30,170 --> 03:03:32,730
You recognize the references too.

5926
03:03:32,850 --> 03:03:34,490
There hasn't been anything with Brother yet.

5927
03:03:34,950 --> 03:03:37,550
I mean, there was one where he grew taller, right?

5928
03:03:38,330 --> 03:03:38,830
Oh no, no.

5929
03:03:38,850 --> 03:03:39,390
He exploded.

5930
03:03:39,390 --> 03:03:39,830
Just kidding.

5931
03:03:40,130 --> 03:03:41,030
Yeah, he exploded.

5932
03:03:41,190 --> 03:03:43,610
Why did the Brother explode?

5933
03:03:44,770 --> 03:03:46,570
Not just once, but three times.

5934
03:03:46,570 --> 03:03:48,070
I don't think there's actually one in here.

5935
03:03:48,410 --> 03:03:49,150
I don't think so either.

5936
03:03:49,230 --> 03:03:49,810
I don't see anything.

5937
03:03:50,650 --> 03:03:52,250
There's no faces on the floor.

5938
03:03:53,030 --> 03:03:56,790
And someone gave me a blue super chat and was like, Akasupa.

5939
03:03:59,790 --> 03:04:02,350
Wait, does that mean there's an anomaly or there's no anomaly?

5940
03:04:02,630 --> 03:04:03,830
Does blue mean safe?

5941
03:04:06,890 --> 03:04:08,330
Alright, here we go.

5942
03:04:08,710 --> 03:04:09,170
Here we go.

5943
03:04:09,610 --> 03:04:10,850
Swipe or no swiping?

5944
03:04:11,090 --> 03:04:11,970
Here we go.

5945
03:04:13,390 --> 03:04:14,490
Alright, let's wait.

5946
03:04:14,590 --> 03:04:15,990
This is the right elevator.

5947
03:04:16,410 --> 03:04:17,330
There's no anomalies.

5948
03:04:18,730 --> 03:04:20,610
Why are you having me press it?

5949
03:04:20,650 --> 03:04:22,610
I haven't pressed it.

5950
03:04:22,610 --> 03:04:23,970
You made up the rule!

5951
03:04:24,870 --> 03:04:25,150
What?

5952
03:04:25,190 --> 03:04:26,470
That made up the rule!

5953
03:04:26,730 --> 03:04:27,150
What do you mean?

5954
03:04:28,950 --> 03:04:29,350
515.

5955
03:04:30,970 --> 03:04:33,230
Has there been one that we haven't done yet?

5956
03:04:33,310 --> 03:04:33,910
That we haven't saw?

5957
03:04:34,410 --> 03:04:35,510
I think we haven't...

5958
03:04:35,510 --> 03:04:36,290
This one.

5959
03:04:38,370 --> 03:04:39,390
It's the blue screen.

5960
03:04:39,890 --> 03:04:41,550
This was the first one we got, I think.

5961
03:04:41,550 --> 03:04:42,690
It was a long time ago.

5962
03:04:42,850 --> 03:04:45,590
It threw us off because we saw it was real.

5963
03:04:46,690 --> 03:04:47,090
516.

5964
03:04:47,410 --> 03:04:50,690
And I think we haven't gotten the one with the lots of plugs, right?

5965
03:04:50,990 --> 03:04:51,610
No, we did.

5966
03:04:51,850 --> 03:04:53,090
You're the one that called it out.

5967
03:04:54,870 --> 03:04:55,550
We did the previous run though.

5968
03:04:55,750 --> 03:04:56,610
Oh, you're right.

5969
03:04:57,670 --> 03:04:58,390
Oh, you're right!

5970
03:04:59,410 --> 03:04:59,530
Yeah!

5971
03:05:00,330 --> 03:05:01,130
Or did we?

5972
03:05:01,210 --> 03:05:01,670
I can't remember.

5973
03:05:01,810 --> 03:05:03,650
Everything's blending together, you guys.

5974
03:05:03,930 --> 03:05:04,550
All these floors.

5975
03:05:04,650 --> 03:05:06,150
We went through so many floors.

5976
03:05:07,070 --> 03:05:07,530
No...

5977
03:05:07,530 --> 03:05:09,510
I don't know actually.

5978
03:05:09,750 --> 03:05:11,310
Brother, help!

5979
03:05:11,710 --> 03:05:11,830
Brother!

5980
03:05:12,830 --> 03:05:13,890
Brother, we don't know!

5981
03:05:14,610 --> 03:05:15,850
Brother, we don't know!

5982
03:05:17,190 --> 03:05:18,110
I think...

5983
03:05:18,720 --> 03:05:19,430
There's nothing here.

5984
03:05:19,590 --> 03:05:19,990
Are you sure?

5985
03:05:21,990 --> 03:05:23,150
You're trusting me now?

5986
03:05:23,170 --> 03:05:23,550
Are you sure?

5987
03:05:24,870 --> 03:05:26,530
No, I mean I'm not trusting you.

5988
03:05:28,810 --> 03:05:29,250
Brother...

5989
03:05:29,250 --> 03:05:32,310
Guys, I don't know.

5990
03:05:32,430 --> 03:05:34,590
If we fuck up, we go back to zero.

5991
03:05:34,850 --> 03:05:35,010
If we fuck up, we go back to zero.

5992
03:05:35,010 --> 03:05:35,790
All the way to zero.

5993
03:05:36,070 --> 03:05:38,650
You don't want to go back to zero, guys!

5994
03:05:38,990 --> 03:05:39,630
You don't!

5995
03:05:39,630 --> 03:05:40,090
Here we go!

5996
03:05:40,210 --> 03:05:40,550
Here we go!

5997
03:05:45,050 --> 03:05:47,330
Wait, why am I pressing it?

5998
03:05:47,610 --> 03:05:48,830
Because I pressed it last time!

5999
03:05:49,130 --> 03:05:49,970
Alright, here we go.

6000
03:05:50,850 --> 03:05:51,630
Here we go.

6001
03:05:51,630 --> 03:05:52,730
Come on.

6002
03:05:52,730 --> 03:05:53,610
Come on!

6003
03:05:53,630 --> 03:05:54,490
SCP!

6004
03:05:55,070 --> 03:05:55,930
SCP!

6005
03:05:56,730 --> 03:05:57,390
SCP!

6006
03:06:01,910 --> 03:06:02,770
You...

6007
03:06:03,600 --> 03:06:04,950
No, chat.

6008
03:06:09,790 --> 03:06:12,150
What did we miss?

6009
03:06:12,270 --> 03:06:13,110
What did we miss?

6010
03:06:14,570 --> 03:06:17,030
There was no anomalies!

6011
03:06:17,470 --> 03:06:19,430
Did we go to the wrong elevator?

6012
03:06:20,650 --> 03:06:21,990
No, no we didn't.

6013
03:06:22,030 --> 03:06:23,330
No, no we didn't.

6014
03:06:23,330 --> 03:06:23,530
Yeah.

6015
03:06:23,690 --> 03:06:24,730
Oh, yeah, that's right.

6016
03:06:24,810 --> 03:06:25,570
This is the first level.

6017
03:06:26,450 --> 03:06:27,550
No, what did we...

6018
03:06:27,550 --> 03:06:28,330
Oh, wait, someone said review.

6019
03:06:28,470 --> 03:06:29,350
We can go review it.

6020
03:06:29,350 --> 03:06:30,190
What did we do?

6021
03:06:31,130 --> 03:06:32,850
Okay, now we have to review.

6022
03:06:33,690 --> 03:06:34,750
What did we miss?

6023
03:06:35,470 --> 03:06:36,270
No way.

6024
03:06:36,450 --> 03:06:37,310
No way!

6025
03:06:39,250 --> 03:06:39,930
What did we...

6026
03:06:39,930 --> 03:06:41,290
There was no anomalies!

6027
03:06:41,790 --> 03:06:42,190
Nobody super chatted us!

6028
03:06:42,190 --> 03:06:42,910
It was the door.

6029
03:06:42,910 --> 03:06:43,990
We got that one.

6030
03:06:44,110 --> 03:06:45,370
It was like the first one we got.

6031
03:06:45,790 --> 03:06:46,050
Yeah!

6032
03:06:46,070 --> 03:06:47,950
Nobody super chatted us!

6033
03:06:47,950 --> 03:06:49,330
No smiley!

6034
03:06:49,330 --> 03:06:50,170
No one else noticed!

6035
03:06:50,650 --> 03:06:51,710
Nobody noticed!

6036
03:06:53,310 --> 03:06:53,830
245.

6037
03:06:54,990 --> 03:06:55,510
245.

6038
03:06:55,510 --> 03:06:56,030
245.

6039
03:06:56,630 --> 03:06:57,150
245.

6040
03:06:57,890 --> 03:06:58,410
Two...

6041
03:06:59,870 --> 03:07:00,390
There's...

6042
03:07:02,190 --> 03:07:03,710
Is it like a time thing?

6043
03:07:03,810 --> 03:07:04,890
Like with the head, you know?

6044
03:07:05,090 --> 03:07:06,830
Like we weren't looking in the right direction?

6045
03:07:07,310 --> 03:07:09,190
Someone said... what?

6046
03:07:09,290 --> 03:07:10,130
Under the shelf?

6047
03:07:10,310 --> 03:07:11,150
Is it this box?

6048
03:07:12,810 --> 03:07:13,330
The...

6049
03:07:13,330 --> 03:07:14,530
That thing looks weird!

6050
03:07:15,810 --> 03:07:17,210
Oh my god!

6051
03:07:17,970 --> 03:07:18,530
What?

6052
03:07:18,690 --> 03:07:19,290
Look up.

6053
03:07:20,430 --> 03:07:20,990
Up?

6054
03:07:21,230 --> 03:07:22,030
Look up.

6055
03:07:23,010 --> 03:07:23,570
Where?

6056
03:07:23,630 --> 03:07:23,930
Where?

6057
03:07:23,930 --> 03:07:24,210
Up?

6058
03:07:24,230 --> 03:07:24,790
Look up.

6059
03:07:25,910 --> 03:07:26,750
Look up?

6060
03:07:26,950 --> 03:07:27,470
Look up.

6061
03:07:28,470 --> 03:07:29,030
Oh!

6062
03:07:29,950 --> 03:07:30,510
No!

6063
03:07:30,710 --> 03:07:31,530
Are you kidding me?

6064
03:07:31,750 --> 03:07:32,570
You see it?

6065
03:07:32,750 --> 03:07:34,330
Is it the 6666666666?

6066
03:07:34,330 --> 03:07:36,450
Look up at the box too!

6067
03:07:36,670 --> 03:07:37,410
Look up!

6068
03:07:37,430 --> 03:07:39,050
It's this box right here!

6069
03:07:39,770 --> 03:07:41,890
They said look up!

6070
03:07:42,010 --> 03:07:44,530
There's 6666 label!

6071
03:07:47,810 --> 03:07:48,770
Oh my god!

6072
03:07:48,790 --> 03:07:49,590
Oh my god!

6073
03:07:49,590 --> 03:07:49,930
Here too!

6074
03:07:50,850 --> 03:07:51,270
Oh my god!

6075
03:07:55,230 --> 03:07:56,470
Chat didn't know either.

6076
03:07:56,670 --> 03:07:58,290
Chat didn't know, there was no...

6077
03:07:58,290 --> 03:07:58,770
super chat.

6078
03:07:58,930 --> 03:08:00,190
Chat didn't know either.

6079
03:08:00,310 --> 03:08:01,450
You can't blame it on us!

6080
03:08:01,530 --> 03:08:01,990
We gave it!

6081
03:08:01,990 --> 03:08:04,770
There's like- oh all the bottles say 6662.

6082
03:08:05,090 --> 03:08:10,570
Well they used to say ethanol and- I thought there would only be one 666 because it's the...

6083
03:08:10,570 --> 03:08:13,130
They baited us!

6084
03:08:13,230 --> 03:08:16,850
They always always did one, and now it's like several?

6085
03:08:17,030 --> 03:08:18,010
Now it's two?

6086
03:08:19,250 --> 03:08:20,330
This is messed up.

6087
03:08:20,350 --> 03:08:21,110
This is messed up.

6088
03:08:21,210 --> 03:08:22,050
This is messed up.

6089
03:08:22,510 --> 03:08:23,330
It's not our fault guys.

6090
03:08:23,550 --> 03:08:24,750
It's never the streamers fault.

6091
03:08:27,930 --> 03:08:30,370
One chat member got the labels right.

6092
03:08:30,550 --> 03:08:31,790
No, this is so messed up.

6093
03:08:31,870 --> 03:08:33,330
One guy in the correct direction.

6094
03:08:34,430 --> 03:08:36,850
The one guy was actually correct.

6095
03:08:36,990 --> 03:08:37,850
What is this?

6096
03:08:38,030 --> 03:08:38,430
Oh my god.

6097
03:08:38,430 --> 03:08:39,810
And on the final thing!

6098
03:08:39,850 --> 03:08:41,290
On the final line!

6099
03:08:41,310 --> 03:08:42,510
That was so cheesy!

6100
03:08:43,170 --> 03:08:44,830
That was so cheap.

6101
03:08:45,070 --> 03:08:46,670
Oh my god, that was so cheap.

6102
03:08:46,790 --> 03:08:49,350
We were so happy getting to the sixth...

6103
03:08:49,350 --> 03:08:51,530
Bro, we're stuck at 500 forever.

6104
03:08:51,530 --> 03:08:51,830
Forever?

6105
03:08:52,930 --> 03:08:54,050
It's okay, we can speedrun.

6106
03:08:54,110 --> 03:08:55,450
We know everything now.

6107
03:08:55,550 --> 03:08:56,090
We know them all.

6108
03:08:56,330 --> 03:08:57,230
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6109
03:08:57,770 --> 03:08:58,870
We knew everything.

6110
03:08:59,350 --> 03:08:59,850
Speedrun, speedrun, speedrun.

6111
03:09:00,850 --> 03:09:01,290
Okay.

6112
03:09:03,150 --> 03:09:03,930
What is it?

6113
03:09:05,030 --> 03:09:05,470
666!

6114
03:09:05,690 --> 03:09:06,310
It's 666!

6115
03:09:06,310 --> 03:09:06,630
On the...

6116
03:09:07,410 --> 03:09:08,210
Wrong elevator.

6117
03:09:09,430 --> 03:09:10,430
I saw you.

6118
03:09:10,550 --> 03:09:12,050
I saw you run over there.

6119
03:09:12,150 --> 03:09:12,910
I saw it.

6120
03:09:15,390 --> 03:09:15,830
Okay.

6121
03:09:17,270 --> 03:09:17,710
Okay.

6122
03:09:17,710 --> 03:09:17,930
Okay, okay.

6123
03:09:18,190 --> 03:09:18,970
Okay, we got this.

6124
03:09:19,170 --> 03:09:19,610
Okay.

6125
03:09:20,070 --> 03:09:20,830
We got...

6126
03:09:20,830 --> 03:09:21,510
Wait, what's 666?

6127
03:09:21,510 --> 03:09:23,210
Was it on the trash can or the labels?

6128
03:09:24,150 --> 03:09:25,150
It was on the trash can.

6129
03:09:25,310 --> 03:09:25,950
Okay, okay.

6130
03:09:26,010 --> 03:09:27,490
I'm keeping track so we can like...

6131
03:09:27,490 --> 03:09:31,270
If we get all the anomalies left, then we can just press...

6132
03:09:31,270 --> 03:09:31,670
Okay.

6133
03:09:31,830 --> 03:09:32,550
Nice, nice, nice.

6134
03:09:32,670 --> 03:09:34,070
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

6135
03:09:34,490 --> 03:09:35,090
Nice, nice.

6136
03:09:35,270 --> 03:09:35,650
Okay.

6137
03:09:35,770 --> 03:09:37,710
Not us being like so excited for some of these.

6138
03:09:38,790 --> 03:09:41,250
We're gonna have to get the box one all over again too.

6139
03:09:41,610 --> 03:09:41,770
Oh no!

6140
03:09:43,350 --> 03:09:43,730
Alright.

6141
03:09:44,110 --> 03:09:45,570
I know how to do this faster.

6142
03:09:46,370 --> 03:09:46,750
How?

6143
03:09:46,990 --> 03:09:47,890
One person goes?

6144
03:09:48,130 --> 03:09:48,330
Yeah.

6145
03:09:49,010 --> 03:09:49,390
Okay.

6146
03:09:50,270 --> 03:09:50,650
Okay.

6147
03:09:51,510 --> 03:09:51,970
Here I go.

6148
03:09:54,230 --> 03:09:55,290
Here I go.

6149
03:09:55,390 --> 03:09:55,730
There I go.

6150
03:09:55,730 --> 03:09:56,790
I'm not a damn bitch.

6151
03:09:56,830 --> 03:09:58,750
It's gonna force you in here once there's Johnny.

6152
03:10:01,110 --> 03:10:01,990
It's the bags.

6153
03:10:02,530 --> 03:10:03,290
It's the bags?

6154
03:10:03,450 --> 03:10:03,670
See?

6155
03:10:03,870 --> 03:10:05,210
Look at how fast it is.

6156
03:10:05,430 --> 03:10:07,350
It's like you just press the button when you're...

6157
03:10:07,350 --> 03:10:08,450
What if I'm here?

6158
03:10:08,810 --> 03:10:09,830
What if it's a non...

6159
03:10:09,830 --> 03:10:10,530
What if it's nothing?

6160
03:10:10,730 --> 03:10:11,830
What if you have to go all the way back?

6161
03:10:11,950 --> 03:10:13,930
I'm gonna lie to you at some point.

6162
03:10:13,990 --> 03:10:14,630
I'm gonna tell you.

6163
03:10:14,690 --> 03:10:16,690
We all wanna leave the hospital.

6164
03:10:19,370 --> 03:10:21,490
If you lie, it'll be a lie.

6165
03:10:21,490 --> 03:10:22,850
It affects you too.

6166
03:10:28,030 --> 03:10:28,670
Here we go.

6167
03:10:34,030 --> 03:10:34,950
It's the boxes.

6168
03:10:35,670 --> 03:10:36,490
No, really?

6169
03:10:36,730 --> 03:10:37,190
I'm coming out.

6170
03:10:37,190 --> 03:10:37,790
I'm coming out.

6171
03:10:37,930 --> 03:10:38,550
I'm leaving.

6172
03:10:38,770 --> 03:10:39,710
I'm getting out of here.

6173
03:10:39,850 --> 03:10:40,110
Really?

6174
03:10:40,270 --> 03:10:41,010
The boxes?

6175
03:10:41,010 --> 03:10:41,250
I'm coming out.

6176
03:10:41,550 --> 03:10:43,230
Wait, I thought you were an expert on this.

6177
03:10:43,270 --> 03:10:43,730
What happened?

6178
03:10:44,310 --> 03:10:45,170
I'm coming out.

6179
03:10:45,270 --> 03:10:45,750
Yeah?

6180
03:10:45,870 --> 03:10:46,710
Any second now?

6181
03:10:46,990 --> 03:10:47,830
I'm coming out.

6182
03:10:47,970 --> 03:10:50,090
Do you see the boxes like getting pushed from the...

6183
03:10:51,770 --> 03:10:53,110
I come out!

6184
03:10:53,390 --> 03:10:53,430
I'm coming out.

6185
03:10:54,230 --> 03:10:54,890
I'm coming out.

6186
03:10:54,890 --> 03:10:56,230
The box is gonna disappear soon.

6187
03:10:56,990 --> 03:10:57,630
I'm coming out.

6188
03:10:58,290 --> 03:10:59,130
I'm coming out.

6189
03:10:59,430 --> 03:10:59,770
It's the box.

6190
03:10:59,770 --> 03:10:59,790
Do you see?

6191
03:10:59,790 --> 03:11:00,870
I'm kicking them one by one.

6192
03:11:01,190 --> 03:11:02,110
I'm coming out.

6193
03:11:02,550 --> 03:11:02,990
Oh!

6194
03:11:03,010 --> 03:11:03,350
Oh!

6195
03:11:03,350 --> 03:11:04,170
Oh, there you are.

6196
03:11:04,450 --> 03:11:05,970
It disappear didn't it?

6197
03:11:06,090 --> 03:11:06,370
No, it didn't.

6198
03:11:06,370 --> 03:11:07,010
You didn't do it yourself.

6199
03:11:07,230 --> 03:11:07,550
No, I didn't.

6200
03:11:07,550 --> 03:11:08,570
You didn't do it yourself.

6201
03:11:08,770 --> 03:11:09,350
I punched my way out.

6202
03:11:09,350 --> 03:11:09,430
I punched my way out.

6203
03:11:09,430 --> 03:11:10,870
You did not do it yourself.

6204
03:11:16,210 --> 03:11:17,450
Oh my god.

6205
03:11:18,670 --> 03:11:19,890
Oh my god.

6206
03:11:20,350 --> 03:11:21,190
Here we go.

6207
03:11:21,250 --> 03:11:21,470
Here we go.

6208
03:11:22,030 --> 03:11:23,150
I'm on my way!

6209
03:11:23,530 --> 03:11:24,310
You got this!

6210
03:11:24,710 --> 03:11:25,950
Go Min-go!

6211
03:11:26,050 --> 03:11:26,950
Stookie is too much of a baby!

6212
03:11:27,250 --> 03:11:28,510
I am not a baby!

6213
03:11:28,610 --> 03:11:30,430
I am trying to be efficient here!

6214
03:11:30,930 --> 03:11:32,630
I am not a baby!

6215
03:11:32,630 --> 03:11:34,190
I'm not a baby!

6216
03:11:34,890 --> 03:11:37,550
Uh, I think... wait hold on let me check the labels.

6217
03:11:37,550 --> 03:11:38,090
No, not really?

6218
03:11:38,130 --> 03:11:38,470
Okay.

6219
03:11:39,810 --> 03:11:40,910
Check the smiles.

6220
03:11:40,950 --> 03:11:42,310
Smiley's, Smiley's, Smiley's.

6221
03:11:42,590 --> 03:11:43,630
Smiley's on the light switch?

6222
03:11:44,070 --> 03:11:44,610
Yes.

6223
03:11:44,750 --> 03:11:44,930
Alright.

6224
03:11:45,410 --> 03:11:45,950
Okay.

6225
03:11:46,890 --> 03:11:47,690
Oh my god.

6226
03:11:48,330 --> 03:11:51,990
We fucked up floor 500 like four times already.

6227
03:11:52,790 --> 03:11:54,070
No, it was like three!

6228
03:11:54,270 --> 03:11:54,790
It was like three.

6229
03:11:54,830 --> 03:11:56,450
Oh, now you can count.

6230
03:11:56,790 --> 03:11:58,730
I think this is our third run.

6231
03:11:59,950 --> 03:12:01,550
Now you can count.

6232
03:12:01,810 --> 03:12:03,450
Oh, no actually you don't.

6233
03:12:03,470 --> 03:12:04,450
This is our fourth run.

6234
03:12:04,650 --> 03:12:06,830
This is actually our fourth run.

6235
03:12:06,930 --> 03:12:06,950
It is?

6236
03:12:06,950 --> 03:12:06,950
For real?

6237
03:12:07,150 --> 03:12:07,630
No way.

6238
03:12:08,570 --> 03:12:11,470
I'm with you this time because I think it's no anomaly time.

6239
03:12:11,870 --> 03:12:12,870
I think you're right.

6240
03:12:13,290 --> 03:12:13,730
Um...

6241
03:12:14,990 --> 03:12:15,930
I'm double checking here.

6242
03:12:15,950 --> 03:12:16,190
Double checking everything.

6243
03:12:17,270 --> 03:12:18,530
Okay, you're right.

6244
03:12:18,770 --> 03:12:19,410
See?

6245
03:12:19,770 --> 03:12:21,250
I'm so good at gambling.

6246
03:12:24,970 --> 03:12:27,050
Probability wise, I was right.

6247
03:12:28,870 --> 03:12:30,150
This game...

6248
03:12:31,010 --> 03:12:31,650
Okay.

6249
03:12:31,910 --> 03:12:34,510
Oh my god it's so intense now.

6250
03:12:34,710 --> 03:12:35,690
Oh god, it's so intense.

6251
03:12:36,470 --> 03:12:38,010
Oh, Brother is exploding!

6252
03:12:38,290 --> 03:12:38,910
Brother is exploding!

6253
03:12:38,910 --> 03:12:39,870
Oh, this time it's a close one!

6254
03:12:41,050 --> 03:12:41,690
Alright.

6255
03:12:41,890 --> 03:12:42,770
Exploding Brother.

6256
03:12:43,030 --> 03:12:45,510
We are missing the label six.

6257
03:12:45,730 --> 03:12:45,930
Bye Brother.

6258
03:12:45,950 --> 03:12:50,530
The label, the baby, the six plugs and the body heads.

6259
03:12:51,130 --> 03:12:51,570
Wait.

6260
03:12:51,890 --> 03:12:52,170
And the face.

6261
03:12:52,230 --> 03:12:55,610
The labels, the baby... The floor...

6262
03:12:56,530 --> 03:12:57,570
Oh, the face.

6263
03:12:57,790 --> 03:12:59,630
Face on the ground, salad fingers.

6264
03:13:00,270 --> 03:13:01,050
No label.

6265
03:13:02,650 --> 03:13:04,030
See, I'm helping now.

6266
03:13:05,050 --> 03:13:06,070
Yeah, because we're close.

6267
03:13:07,610 --> 03:13:09,570
Yeah, now we have to go all the way to the other one.

6268
03:13:09,710 --> 03:13:10,070
Yeah.

6269
03:13:10,090 --> 03:13:11,030
Yeah, I think we're good.

6270
03:13:11,210 --> 03:13:12,430
Go all the way down.

6271
03:13:12,490 --> 03:13:12,990
The hinges.

6272
03:13:13,130 --> 03:13:14,150
Yep, it's correct.

6273
03:13:14,730 --> 03:13:15,170
Okay.

6274
03:13:15,210 --> 03:13:15,890
We almost... Ooh, that was close.

6275
03:13:15,890 --> 03:13:16,170
Oh, yeah.

6276
03:13:17,010 --> 03:13:19,750
I'm used to checking it on the way to running there.

6277
03:13:20,030 --> 03:13:20,970
Yeah, from this side.

6278
03:13:21,090 --> 03:13:21,350
Yeah, we got Johnny.

6279
03:13:21,390 --> 03:13:22,370
We need Johnny.

6280
03:13:23,850 --> 03:13:24,250
Okay.

6281
03:13:24,530 --> 03:13:24,670
Don't hit the floor.

6282
03:13:24,710 --> 03:13:25,090
We're good.

6283
03:13:25,190 --> 03:13:25,530
We're good.

6284
03:13:25,650 --> 03:13:26,050
We're good.

6285
03:13:26,050 --> 03:13:26,250
We're good.

6286
03:13:26,250 --> 03:13:29,250
Unless... I think it like slowly starts to appear though.

6287
03:13:29,330 --> 03:13:30,430
So we might have to like...

6288
03:13:31,290 --> 03:13:32,250
Wait a second.

6289
03:13:32,730 --> 03:13:33,310
Which one?

6290
03:13:33,370 --> 03:13:33,810
The floor?

6291
03:13:34,470 --> 03:13:36,510
Yeah, like it's the... It's like the fade in.

6292
03:13:36,530 --> 03:13:36,810
Like the QR code.

6293
03:13:36,810 --> 03:13:37,750
Oh, like the QR code.

6294
03:13:37,850 --> 03:13:37,970
Yeah.

6295
03:13:38,810 --> 03:13:39,210
Yeah.

6296
03:13:39,290 --> 03:13:40,230
I'm checking all.

6297
03:13:41,550 --> 03:13:41,950
Um...

6298
03:13:43,050 --> 03:13:44,110
Nothing on the floor.

6299
03:13:45,150 --> 03:13:45,550
Labels.

6300
03:13:45,550 --> 03:13:46,870
Labels are disinfectant.

6301
03:13:47,590 --> 03:13:47,910
Um...

6302
03:13:47,910 --> 03:13:50,710
Do we got the... Do we get the heads at the trash can yet?

6303
03:13:51,370 --> 03:13:52,450
Yeah, we already got that one.

6304
03:13:52,590 --> 03:13:52,770
Oh, okay.

6305
03:13:52,830 --> 03:13:53,690
So we don't have to care about that.

6306
03:13:53,910 --> 03:13:54,770
Alright, no anomalies.

6307
03:13:54,910 --> 03:13:54,970
So I think we're good.

6308
03:13:55,190 --> 03:13:55,450
Yeah.

6309
03:13:55,550 --> 03:13:55,890
I think we're good.

6310
03:13:56,210 --> 03:13:56,950
No anomalies.

6311
03:13:57,290 --> 03:13:57,990
Check the door.

6312
03:13:58,030 --> 03:13:58,670
The door is good.

6313
03:13:58,670 --> 03:13:59,170
The door is good.

6314
03:13:59,550 --> 03:14:00,010
We're good.

6315
03:14:00,410 --> 03:14:00,450
Okay.

6316
03:14:01,230 --> 03:14:01,990
We're getting better.

6317
03:14:02,110 --> 03:14:04,470
It only took us four tries, but we're getting better now.

6318
03:14:05,450 --> 03:14:05,770
Yes.

6319
03:14:06,810 --> 03:14:07,870
Oh, my God.

6320
03:14:09,770 --> 03:14:10,090
Bing.

6321
03:14:10,370 --> 03:14:10,690
Bing.

6322
03:14:11,230 --> 03:14:11,550
Yes.

6323
03:14:12,310 --> 03:14:12,630
Okay.

6324
03:14:13,010 --> 03:14:13,330
Okay.

6325
03:14:15,790 --> 03:14:16,590
Oh, baby.

6430
03:14:34,490 --> 03:14:34,890

Baby.

6434
03:14:35,830 --> 03:14:37,550
Baby Holy shit.

6435
03:14:42,930 --> 03:14:44,590
I want him to look at me this time.

6436
03:14:44,770 --> 03:14:46,670
His eyes kind of look to the right.

6437
03:14:46,670 --> 03:14:47,250
You're right.

6438
03:15:02,470 --> 03:15:03,970
What's wrong with us anymore?

6439
03:15:04,470 --> 03:15:07,690
We need to get the floor 666 you guys.

6440
03:15:07,690 --> 03:15:08,950
I've been playing this game for three hours.

6441
03:15:09,250 --> 03:15:10,330
We're close to four hours.

6442
03:15:11,370 --> 03:15:13,030
Oh the door hinges.

6443
03:15:13,150 --> 03:15:14,630
We also gotta worry about the door hinges.

6444
03:15:14,750 --> 03:15:15,510
666 labels!

6445
03:15:15,550 --> 03:15:16,650
666 labels are...

6446
03:15:16,650 --> 03:15:17,090
Alright, nice.

6447
03:15:19,390 --> 03:15:19,690
Alright.

6448
03:15:20,430 --> 03:15:21,030
513!

6449
03:15:30,150 --> 03:15:34,790
I think the door hinges are gonna be like the last one.

6450
03:15:34,910 --> 03:15:35,970
There's nothing on the floor.

6451
03:15:36,350 --> 03:15:37,290
Wait, what are we missing?

6452
03:15:37,530 --> 03:15:38,750
We're missing the floor.

6453
03:15:38,830 --> 03:15:40,430
We're missing the...

6454
03:15:42,410 --> 03:15:43,310
Door hinge.

6455
03:15:43,710 --> 03:15:44,210
I think nothing.

6456
03:15:44,370 --> 03:15:46,350
And also the one of all the...

6457
03:15:46,650 --> 03:15:48,450
There's nothing, so I think we're good.

6458
03:15:48,610 --> 03:15:49,570
I think we're good.

6459
03:15:49,710 --> 03:15:50,550
Back to there.

6460
03:15:51,890 --> 03:15:53,810
We're back to there.

6461
03:15:54,050 --> 03:15:56,870
We still have a whole other floor.

6462
03:15:56,890 --> 03:15:58,730
We still have three more.

6463
03:16:01,970 --> 03:16:04,290
Why did you suggest this?

6464
03:16:04,690 --> 03:16:05,310
I didn't.

6465
03:16:05,330 --> 03:16:07,310
Why did you agree to this?

6466
03:16:08,950 --> 03:16:09,550
Fourteen.

6467
03:16:09,690 --> 03:16:10,070
Fourteen.

6468
03:16:11,110 --> 03:16:14,270
It should be... last three, right?

6469
03:16:15,510 --> 03:16:16,070
I think so.

6470
03:16:16,070 --> 03:16:17,310
Last three, so it's all anomalies.

6471
03:16:19,110 --> 03:16:21,110
No, this one... unless it's the floor.

6472
03:16:21,130 --> 03:16:21,490
It's the floor.

6473
03:16:21,970 --> 03:16:23,890
It's all three, so it's all how much you want to bet.

6474
03:16:25,010 --> 03:16:26,370
Do you really want to do this?

6475
03:16:26,370 --> 03:16:27,970
Yeah, let's do it.

6476
03:16:29,730 --> 03:16:31,250
It's literally all anomalies.

6477
03:16:31,270 --> 03:16:32,250
You know I'm right.

6478
03:16:32,650 --> 03:16:33,930
Okay, we'll do it.

6479
03:16:33,950 --> 03:16:34,390
You know I'm right.

6480
03:16:34,430 --> 03:16:35,230
What are we missing?

6481
03:16:35,310 --> 03:16:36,450
We're missing the door hinge.

6482
03:16:36,990 --> 03:16:38,110
And we're missing the six.

6483
03:16:38,110 --> 03:16:38,850
We can see from here.

6484
03:16:42,310 --> 03:16:43,130
It's the six plugs.

6485
03:16:43,670 --> 03:16:44,610
How much you want to bet.

6486
03:16:45,310 --> 03:16:45,710
Okay.

6487
03:16:46,070 --> 03:16:46,330
Six plugs.

6488
03:16:46,570 --> 03:16:47,350
Okay, do it.

6489
03:16:47,430 --> 03:16:48,110
Yeah, do it.

6490
03:16:48,110 --> 03:16:48,650
I'm going to do it.

6491
03:16:49,830 --> 03:16:50,330
Do it.

6492
03:16:50,330 --> 03:16:50,690
This is six plugs.

6493
03:16:50,750 --> 03:16:51,070
All right.

6494
03:16:51,170 --> 03:16:52,050
The moment of truth.

6495
03:16:52,250 --> 03:16:52,550
Do it.

6496
03:17:00,070 --> 03:17:01,230
And it's the door hinge.

6497
03:17:01,250 --> 03:17:01,590
I can see it.

6498
03:17:02,350 --> 03:17:03,530
I told you.

6499
03:17:03,690 --> 03:17:04,050
Oh my gosh.

6500
03:17:04,790 --> 03:17:06,430
Okay, that pause though.

6501
03:17:07,110 --> 03:17:08,710
I literally held my breath.

6502
03:17:08,790 --> 03:17:09,210
I couldn't...

6503
03:17:09,210 --> 03:17:10,810
I was like, please be right.

6504
03:17:10,930 --> 03:17:11,250
I told you.

6505
03:17:11,550 --> 03:17:12,730
I'm so... Oh my gosh, it's the back rooms.

6506
03:17:13,010 --> 03:17:13,990
Where are the back rooms?

6507
03:17:13,990 --> 03:17:15,230
Where are the back rooms?

6508
03:17:15,610 --> 03:17:16,350
I'm in...

6509
03:17:16,350 --> 03:17:16,690
Oh!

6510
03:17:19,330 --> 03:17:20,030
Is it me?

6511
03:17:20,090 --> 03:17:20,870
Is it me?

6512
03:17:20,930 --> 03:17:21,310
It's me.

6513
03:17:21,370 --> 03:17:21,750
It's me.

6514
03:17:21,790 --> 03:17:22,150
It's me.

6515
03:17:22,230 --> 03:17:23,970
I'm literally the sacrifice man.

6516
03:17:24,070 --> 03:17:25,010
You guys do this.

6517
03:17:25,350 --> 03:17:26,590
I'm trying to find it.

6518
03:17:28,030 --> 03:17:29,150
I don't know what to do.

6519
03:17:29,470 --> 03:17:30,430
Oh my gosh.

6520
03:17:30,730 --> 03:17:31,150
It's right there.

6521
03:17:31,150 --> 03:17:32,390
I sacrificed myself.

6522
03:17:33,730 --> 03:17:34,590
Oh my gosh.

6523
03:17:35,290 --> 03:17:36,110
It's after me.

6524
03:17:36,150 --> 03:17:37,110
It's after me.

6525
03:17:37,170 --> 03:17:37,250
It's after me.

6526
03:17:37,250 --> 03:17:37,410
It's after me.

6527
03:17:37,410 --> 03:17:37,690
Oh my gosh.

6528
03:17:37,730 --> 03:17:37,810
No.

6529
03:17:37,870 --> 03:17:38,690
It's the door.

6530
03:17:47,770 --> 03:17:49,370
He has to break it.

6531
03:17:49,570 --> 03:17:51,330
He has to break it first.

6532
03:17:51,970 --> 03:17:53,110
What is this bullshit?

6533
03:17:53,110 --> 03:17:54,990
How do we lead him to that?

6534
03:17:56,210 --> 03:17:56,630
Let's see it.

6535
03:17:56,650 --> 03:17:57,330
You can clutch this.

6536
03:17:57,470 --> 03:17:58,350
You can clutch this.

6537
03:17:58,350 --> 03:17:59,170
You clutch all...

6538
03:17:59,170 --> 03:17:59,450
How do I do it?

6539
03:17:59,450 --> 03:18:00,190
How do I do it?

6540
03:18:00,190 --> 03:18:00,750
How do I do it?

6541
03:18:00,790 --> 03:18:01,370
How do I do it?

6542
03:18:01,370 --> 03:18:02,070
I don't know.

6543
03:18:02,170 --> 03:18:02,650
I don't...

6544
03:18:02,650 --> 03:18:03,070
Oh my gosh.

6545
03:18:03,410 --> 03:18:03,570
Oh my gosh.

6546
03:18:03,690 --> 03:18:04,150
Oh my gosh.

6547
03:18:04,210 --> 03:18:04,450
Oh my gosh.

6548
03:18:04,570 --> 03:18:05,030
Oh my gosh.

6549
03:18:05,030 --> 03:18:05,110
Oh my gosh.

6550
03:18:05,110 --> 03:18:05,290
You're gaming.

6551
03:18:05,450 --> 03:18:05,850
You're gaming.

6552
03:18:05,930 --> 03:18:06,490
Game of the year.

6553
03:18:06,550 --> 03:18:07,070
Game of the year.

6554
03:18:07,930 --> 03:18:08,250
Game of the year.

6555
03:18:10,090 --> 03:18:11,770
Why do I always survive?

6556
03:18:13,510 --> 03:18:14,650
Did he just sigh?

6557
03:18:14,810 --> 03:18:15,550
Did he just go...

6558
03:18:18,470 --> 03:18:19,270
This is it.

6559
03:18:19,270 --> 03:18:19,830
Oh my gosh.

6560
03:18:20,110 --> 03:18:20,430
600.

6561
03:18:21,530 --> 03:18:22,650
600 baby, 600.

6562
03:18:23,190 --> 03:18:23,510
600.

6563
03:18:23,790 --> 03:18:24,830
We're almost there.

6564
03:18:26,890 --> 03:18:27,330
Brother!

6565
03:18:29,320 --> 03:18:29,540
Brother!

6566
03:18:29,540 --> 03:18:30,840
Okay, it's the operation room.

6567
03:18:31,360 --> 03:18:32,940
Wow, there's a lot going on in here.

6568
03:18:33,280 --> 03:18:34,300
Oh my god, okay.

6569
03:18:34,560 --> 03:18:35,360
And then there's an opera.

6570
03:18:36,000 --> 03:18:39,140
There's another x-ray over here that we can't go in.

6571
03:18:39,700 --> 03:18:40,080
Okay.

6572
03:18:40,140 --> 03:18:42,400
There's x-rays, there's...

6573
03:18:42,400 --> 03:18:43,700
There's a calendar here.

6574
03:18:44,320 --> 03:18:46,120
May, June, we care about your health.

6575
03:18:46,900 --> 03:18:47,600
Okay, nice.

6576
03:18:47,960 --> 03:18:49,700
I think I absorbed everything in.

6577
03:18:51,020 --> 03:18:51,460
Okay.

6578
03:18:53,840 --> 03:18:54,580
There's a computer.

6579
03:18:54,580 --> 03:18:55,500
The computer, the screen is off.

6580
03:18:55,800 --> 03:18:56,940
Final stretch, baby.

6581
03:18:57,340 --> 03:18:58,680
The final stretch.

6582
03:18:59,220 --> 03:18:59,900
Let's just do it.

6583
03:18:59,940 --> 03:19:00,600
We'll learn as we go.

6584
03:19:04,040 --> 03:19:06,320
That's how we did it in floor 500, baby.

6585
03:19:08,340 --> 03:19:10,580
Why can't this one be in the middle of the room?

6586
03:19:12,800 --> 03:19:13,200
Alright.

6587
03:19:13,580 --> 03:19:14,400
Alright, here we go.

6588
03:19:14,540 --> 03:19:14,960
Here we go.

6589
03:19:16,880 --> 03:19:17,280
Brother.

6590
03:19:17,280 --> 03:19:17,680
Brother.

6591
03:19:19,180 --> 03:19:20,400
All the screens are off.

6592
03:19:22,040 --> 03:19:22,440
Nothing...

6593
03:19:22,440 --> 03:19:23,580
No sixes anywhere.

6594
03:19:25,400 --> 03:19:26,420
I think it's...

6595
03:19:26,420 --> 03:19:27,020
No anomaly.

6596
03:19:27,680 --> 03:19:29,580
Oh my god, why am I glitching so bad?

6597
03:19:29,760 --> 03:19:31,440
I don't see any anomalies anywhere.

6598
03:19:31,720 --> 03:19:32,280
Oh yeah, me too.

6599
03:19:33,100 --> 03:19:34,720
Oh, is that a glitch?

6600
03:19:34,900 --> 03:19:36,260
Or is that an anomaly?

6601
03:19:36,500 --> 03:19:37,100
Is that an anomaly?

6602
03:19:37,720 --> 03:19:40,480
I think... oh, I'm glitching so much.

6603
03:19:40,580 --> 03:19:41,180
Even now.

6604
03:19:41,740 --> 03:19:42,180
Wow!

6605
03:19:43,100 --> 03:19:43,540
Wow!

6606
03:19:44,300 --> 03:19:45,580
I think that's an anomaly.

6607
03:19:45,760 --> 03:19:46,520
Is that an anomaly?

6608
03:19:46,840 --> 03:19:47,220
Wow!

6609
03:19:47,780 --> 03:19:49,240
That has to be an anomaly.

6610
03:19:49,300 --> 03:19:49,760
There's no way.

6611
03:19:50,100 --> 03:19:50,960
There's no way, right?

6612
03:19:51,680 --> 03:19:53,340
I mean, we're in 601.

6613
03:19:54,580 --> 03:19:55,120
It doesn't matter.

6614
03:19:57,440 --> 03:19:59,040
That has to be an anomaly.

6615
03:19:59,220 --> 03:19:59,620
It has to be.

6616
03:20:00,940 --> 03:20:01,380
Yay!

6617
03:20:01,920 --> 03:20:02,680
That was cool.

6618
03:20:02,900 --> 03:20:03,660
That was a cool anomaly.

6619
03:20:03,820 --> 03:20:05,020
Yeah, I thought we were lagging.

6620
03:20:05,080 --> 03:20:06,000
I was like, whoa.

6621
03:20:06,360 --> 03:20:08,240
Oh, Brother scares me every time, man.

6622
03:20:09,200 --> 03:20:09,640
Uh...

6623
03:20:09,640 --> 03:20:12,520
That was such a creative anomaly, though.

6624
03:20:12,700 --> 03:20:13,480
Yeah, that one's fun.

6625
03:20:13,960 --> 03:20:16,340
Because you can't tell if it's kusoge or...

6626
03:20:16,340 --> 03:20:18,020
Yeah, or just...

6627
03:20:18,860 --> 03:20:20,040
You're the game itself.

6628
03:20:20,900 --> 03:20:22,040
May, June, July.

6629
03:20:22,040 --> 03:20:23,500
We care about your health.

6630
03:20:23,840 --> 03:20:24,740
Disease history.

6631
03:20:26,140 --> 03:20:26,540
Nothing.

6632
03:20:26,920 --> 03:20:27,520
I don't see anything.

6633
03:20:27,980 --> 03:20:29,080
I don't see anything either.

6634
03:20:29,380 --> 03:20:30,960
I think we're actually good this time.

6635
03:20:31,920 --> 03:20:32,460
An anomaly.

6636
03:20:33,560 --> 03:20:34,300
Oh my god.

6637
03:20:35,640 --> 03:20:37,220
Don't fuck with us like that.

6638
03:20:38,100 --> 03:20:39,180
I'm checking now, though.

6639
03:20:39,280 --> 03:20:39,640
I'm checking!

6640
03:20:39,780 --> 03:20:40,100
I'm checking!

6641
03:20:43,900 --> 03:20:44,300
603.

6642
03:20:45,300 --> 03:20:45,700
603.

6643
03:20:45,820 --> 03:20:47,040
We have to check the labels, too.

6644
03:20:47,120 --> 03:20:48,980
Just to see if there's any sixes.

6645
03:20:51,280 --> 03:20:51,760
603!

6646
03:20:52,560 --> 03:20:53,040
603!

6647
03:20:53,040 --> 03:20:53,600
603, baby!

6648
03:20:54,120 --> 03:20:54,660
Let's go!

6649
03:20:55,520 --> 03:20:57,720
I think Brother's gonna be standing at one point.

6650
03:20:57,760 --> 03:20:58,300
Yeah, me too.

6651
03:20:58,480 --> 03:20:59,760
Or he's gonna change his face.

6652
03:21:00,960 --> 03:21:02,280
Okay, he's fine right now.

6653
03:21:02,600 --> 03:21:03,840
Nothing on the monitors.

6654
03:21:05,000 --> 03:21:06,040
Nothing on the side.

6655
03:21:06,680 --> 03:21:07,800
Nothing in the operating.

6656
03:21:08,420 --> 03:21:09,780
No 666 anywhere.

6657
03:21:10,440 --> 03:21:11,140
I'm checking.

6658
03:21:11,760 --> 03:21:13,080
We care about your health.

6659
03:21:13,180 --> 03:21:13,840
May, June, July.

6660
03:21:14,040 --> 03:21:14,780
It's the same date.

6661
03:21:15,000 --> 03:21:15,460
History.

6662
03:21:16,660 --> 03:21:18,540
There's no way that there's nothing here.

6663
03:21:19,020 --> 03:21:19,680
I don't know.

6664
03:21:19,740 --> 03:21:20,580
We could get two in a row.

6665
03:21:20,640 --> 03:21:21,260
No anomalies.

6666
03:21:21,720 --> 03:21:24,440
That's the secret one.

6667
03:21:24,500 --> 03:21:25,880
No anomalies for twice.

6668
03:21:26,640 --> 03:21:27,400
I don't think so.

6669
03:21:27,620 --> 03:21:27,820
Alright.

6670
03:21:28,260 --> 03:21:29,420
Wait, did they not hear that?

6671
03:21:29,480 --> 03:21:29,840
Hear what?

6672
03:21:31,260 --> 03:21:32,220
They're fucking with you.

6673
03:21:33,900 --> 03:21:34,820
There's no way.

6674
03:21:34,900 --> 03:21:35,800
They're fucking with you.

6675
03:21:36,900 --> 03:21:37,840
What was that noise?

6676
03:21:38,240 --> 03:21:38,840
What do you mean?

6677
03:21:44,000 --> 03:21:45,000
I don't hear anything.

6678
03:21:46,200 --> 03:21:47,660
Oh, that's you.

6679
03:21:47,940 --> 03:21:48,520
That's me.

6680
03:21:48,520 --> 03:21:50,640
They said hole on the bed?

6681
03:21:51,420 --> 03:21:51,980
What?

6682
03:21:52,880 --> 03:21:54,280
There's always been a hole here.

6683
03:21:55,400 --> 03:21:56,220
What hole?

6684
03:21:56,280 --> 03:21:56,920
There's always been a hole there.

6685
03:21:57,240 --> 03:21:58,020
What hole?

6686
03:21:59,940 --> 03:22:01,060
This hole?

6687
03:22:01,800 --> 03:22:03,140
Was that a girl?

6688
03:22:03,680 --> 03:22:05,060
I'm scared now.

6689
03:22:06,240 --> 03:22:06,800
What?

6690
03:22:06,980 --> 03:22:08,300
That's always been there.

6691
03:22:08,300 --> 03:22:09,040
Oh, this hole here.

6692
03:22:10,120 --> 03:22:11,660
It's always been there.

6693
03:22:12,900 --> 03:22:13,780
What do you mean?

6694
03:22:14,160 --> 03:22:14,840
Hold on.

6695
03:22:18,300 --> 03:22:18,860
Ah!

6696
03:22:20,680 --> 03:22:21,200
Wow.

6697
03:22:21,860 --> 03:22:22,900
Very realistic.

6698
03:22:24,040 --> 03:22:27,240
Look, we've been playing for almost four hours.

6699
03:22:27,320 --> 03:22:29,200
I can't dedicate a voice for it.

6700
03:22:29,360 --> 03:22:29,380
Let's just go.

6701
03:22:29,920 --> 03:22:30,940
Okay, anyway.

6702
03:22:32,520 --> 03:22:33,760
Up we go.

6703
03:22:34,300 --> 03:22:35,480
I'm aware 603.

6704
03:22:35,960 --> 03:22:36,880
There's no way.

6705
03:22:37,460 --> 03:22:39,420
At best, we retry three floors.

6706
03:22:39,820 --> 03:22:41,060
It's better than not.

6707
03:22:41,060 --> 03:22:41,480
True, true, true.

6708
03:22:41,860 --> 03:22:42,500
It's better than...

6709
03:22:48,540 --> 03:22:50,260
Okay, let's see if there's a hole on the bed.

6710
03:22:50,280 --> 03:22:51,340
Let's see.

6711
03:22:51,540 --> 03:22:53,180
There was no hole on the bed.

6712
03:22:53,540 --> 03:22:55,020
There's no hole on the bed.

6713
03:22:55,040 --> 03:22:56,300
There's no hole on the bed.

6714
03:22:56,440 --> 03:22:58,620
There's no hole on the bed.

6715
03:22:59,200 --> 03:23:01,020
We were like, there's always been a hole.

6716
03:23:01,040 --> 03:23:03,140
We were thinking of like the fucking chiropractor.

6717
03:23:06,040 --> 03:23:06,480
Massages.

6718
03:23:07,760 --> 03:23:10,220
I forgot this is an operating table.

6719
03:23:11,780 --> 03:23:14,180
No, operating tables do have holes in the bed.

6720
03:23:14,320 --> 03:23:15,400
Sometimes they have holes, right?

6721
03:23:15,800 --> 03:23:17,260
Yeah, for brain surgery.

6722
03:23:18,040 --> 03:23:18,860
I don't know.

6723
03:23:18,980 --> 03:23:19,580
I don't know.

6724
03:23:20,720 --> 03:23:22,920
I thought it was there to keep your head comfy.

6725
03:23:23,100 --> 03:23:23,620
Me too.

6726
03:23:24,940 --> 03:23:26,380
Okay, well now we know.

6727
03:23:26,920 --> 03:23:28,520
Whoa, whoa, it's a game to game.

6728
03:23:29,680 --> 03:23:30,640
Oh, whoa.

6729
03:23:30,860 --> 03:23:32,080
Whoa, it's us.

6730
03:23:32,760 --> 03:23:33,640
Oh, it's you.

6731
03:23:33,680 --> 03:23:34,580
It's following you.

6732
03:23:34,580 --> 03:23:35,240
It's my POV.

6733
03:23:35,480 --> 03:23:36,760
It's your POV.

6734
03:23:36,760 --> 03:23:40,880
Guys, at least it was like three floors.

6735
03:23:41,720 --> 03:23:43,240
Guys, at least it was like three floors.

6736
03:23:43,240 --> 03:23:43,560
Yeah, it's fine.

6737
03:23:43,660 --> 03:23:44,460
Now we know.

6738
03:23:45,200 --> 03:23:47,060
And then we call chat crazy.

6739
03:23:49,120 --> 03:23:51,820
We're like, guys, there's always been a hole.

6740
03:23:52,200 --> 03:23:53,300
You're crazy.

6741
03:23:53,720 --> 03:23:54,620
I'm the protagonist.

6742
03:24:00,020 --> 03:24:02,700
They were like, literally, they were like, there's a hole there.

6743
03:24:02,800 --> 03:24:03,620
We're like, oh, yeah.

6744
03:24:03,820 --> 03:24:04,620
Yeah, of course.

6745
03:24:04,680 --> 03:24:06,420
We said it so confidently.

6746
03:24:06,420 --> 03:24:07,220
I know.

6747
03:24:08,260 --> 03:24:10,780
We were so like, yeah, it's a hole.

6748
03:24:10,800 --> 03:24:12,020
Oh my god.

6749
03:24:12,260 --> 03:24:14,440
All operating tables have a hole in it.

6750
03:24:14,600 --> 03:24:15,080
Yeah.

6751
03:24:17,820 --> 03:24:19,840
I don't think I see anything here.

6752
03:24:19,960 --> 03:24:20,880
History mmm.

6753
03:24:21,180 --> 03:24:22,400
History mmm is there.

6754
03:24:22,680 --> 03:24:23,740
There's no 666.

6755
03:24:24,020 --> 03:24:27,440
Brother, we've been doing this for a while now, brother.

6756
03:24:28,200 --> 03:24:28,880
Brother please.

6757
03:24:28,980 --> 03:24:29,500
Brother.

6758
03:24:30,000 --> 03:24:31,000
Brother ugh.

6759
03:24:32,080 --> 03:24:32,860
Brother ugh.

6760
03:24:33,260 --> 03:24:34,100
Brother ugh.

6761
03:24:34,300 --> 03:24:34,680
Brother ugh.

6762
03:24:39,380 --> 03:24:39,900
Okay.

6763
03:24:40,440 --> 03:24:44,300
But like, also chat was gaslighting us while telling us there's a hole.

6764
03:24:44,560 --> 03:24:45,940
Yeah, they were saying exactly.

6765
03:24:46,340 --> 03:24:46,480
Did you hear that?

6766
03:24:47,060 --> 03:24:48,600
Of course we're gonna think that.

6767
03:24:48,600 --> 03:24:50,580
We think that everything is wrong.

6768
03:24:51,140 --> 03:24:51,420
No, we didn't hear anything.

6769
03:24:54,320 --> 03:24:55,080
There's no sixes.

6770
03:24:56,160 --> 03:24:56,680
Oh, well.

6771
03:24:57,240 --> 03:24:58,820
Is there anything on the other side?

6772
03:24:59,400 --> 03:25:00,560
We care about your health.

6773
03:25:01,080 --> 03:25:02,080
May, June, July.

6774
03:25:03,560 --> 03:25:05,040
The labels are normal.

6775
03:25:05,220 --> 03:25:06,020
Labels are normal.

6776
03:25:06,080 --> 03:25:07,620
The x-rays are normal too.

6777
03:25:09,540 --> 03:25:09,980
There's...

6778
03:25:10,820 --> 03:25:13,100
There's no hole on the wall this time.

6779
03:25:13,460 --> 03:25:16,680
I thought I heard like a beeping, but it might have been like just omniscience.

6780
03:25:16,680 --> 03:25:17,040
Yeah, I know.

6781
03:25:17,060 --> 03:25:17,840
I think it's omniscience.

6782
03:25:17,840 --> 03:25:18,500
I didn't hear a beeping.

6783
03:25:18,740 --> 03:25:20,180
Okay, we go to the other side.

6784
03:25:21,220 --> 03:25:22,020
No hollering.

6785
03:25:22,500 --> 03:25:22,940
Alright.

6786
03:25:23,840 --> 03:25:25,460
No, it's not your fault chat.

6787
03:25:25,580 --> 03:25:26,400
It's the whole mess.

6788
03:25:28,000 --> 03:25:28,800
Oh, okay.

6789
03:25:29,040 --> 03:25:31,260
It wasn't your chat that pointed it out.

6790
03:25:31,420 --> 03:25:32,580
Or anything, you know.

6791
03:25:32,580 --> 03:25:33,960
And you chose to ignore it.

6792
03:25:33,980 --> 03:25:35,420
You chose to ignore it.

6793
03:25:35,560 --> 03:25:37,420
Your chat said...

6794
03:25:37,420 --> 03:25:41,000
All your chat said was, did you hear the noise?

6795
03:25:42,660 --> 03:25:45,120
My chat actually called the hole in the bed.

6796
03:25:45,120 --> 03:25:49,040
They probably heard me like humming and were just like, uh oh.

6797
03:25:49,240 --> 03:25:50,620
That wasn't normal.

6798
03:25:51,660 --> 03:25:52,260
Obvious.

6799
03:25:52,420 --> 03:25:54,180
They were just trying to be helpful.

6800
03:25:54,800 --> 03:25:55,620
They were just trying to...

6801
03:25:57,480 --> 03:25:58,320
I don't...

6802
03:25:58,320 --> 03:26:00,080
I don't see anything.

6803
03:26:00,660 --> 03:26:01,480
I can't see...

6804
03:26:01,480 --> 03:26:02,640
Vitamin complex.

6805
03:26:02,820 --> 03:26:04,200
There's no 666.

6806
03:26:04,500 --> 03:26:05,980
We care about your health.

6807
03:26:06,280 --> 03:26:07,560
May, June, July.

6808
03:26:07,660 --> 03:26:10,280
I'm looking to see if any heads pop up.

6809
03:26:11,120 --> 03:26:12,880
Door hinges are good.

6810
03:26:13,980 --> 03:26:14,500
Wait.

6811
03:26:14,620 --> 03:26:15,620
See if there's lag.

6812
03:26:16,520 --> 03:26:17,220
Oh yeah.

6813
03:26:17,260 --> 03:26:17,440
No.

6814
03:26:17,580 --> 03:26:18,140
No lag.

6815
03:26:18,260 --> 03:26:18,700
No lag.

6816
03:26:20,680 --> 03:26:21,480
So here?

6817
03:26:21,680 --> 03:26:22,220
Is it none?

6818
03:26:22,680 --> 03:26:23,480
The floor.

6819
03:26:23,640 --> 03:26:24,480
What about the floor?

6820
03:26:25,360 --> 03:26:26,440
What about the floor?

6821
03:26:26,740 --> 03:26:27,760
Don't gaslight us.

6822
03:26:27,780 --> 03:26:31,120
Oh my god!

6823
03:26:31,120 --> 03:26:33,020
The wires say 666!

6824
03:26:33,480 --> 03:26:34,000
666!

6825
03:26:35,140 --> 03:26:36,460
I saw it before you.

6826
03:26:37,080 --> 03:26:38,020
No, I saw it.

6827
03:26:38,020 --> 03:26:38,620
Cause I trust my chat.

6828
03:26:38,920 --> 03:26:40,120
I saw it in my chat.

6829
03:26:41,340 --> 03:26:45,380
I noticed that they were in perfect circles, but I thought he just copied and pasted them.

6830
03:26:47,220 --> 03:26:49,260
I thought he was being a lazy dev.

6831
03:26:50,420 --> 03:26:51,920
After 600 floors?

6832
03:26:52,200 --> 03:26:54,180
This is the part where he gets lazy?

6833
03:26:55,560 --> 03:26:56,540
Don't worry, Wisps.

6834
03:26:56,560 --> 03:26:57,520
I know you guys saw it first.

6835
03:26:57,820 --> 03:26:58,740
Don't worry, Dragoons.

6836
03:26:58,840 --> 03:26:59,440
I knew you...

6837
03:26:59,440 --> 03:27:03,780
When you guys said 666, I knew you guys were right.

6838
03:27:04,660 --> 03:27:05,100
You guys were so good.

6839
03:27:05,100 --> 03:27:06,880
Cause I trust my chat.

6840
03:27:07,320 --> 03:27:07,960
I... yeah.

6841
03:27:08,620 --> 03:27:09,480
Hole in the bed.

6842
03:27:09,480 --> 03:27:10,200
Hole in the bed.

6843
03:27:10,680 --> 03:27:11,500
Alright, we know.

6844
03:27:11,580 --> 03:27:12,720
Hole in the bed is gone.

6845
03:27:13,500 --> 03:27:14,920
Yeah, hole in the bed is gone, everybody.

6846
03:27:15,580 --> 03:27:17,200
We got hole in the bed out of the way.

6847
03:27:18,960 --> 03:27:20,640
We're so fucking confident.

6848
03:27:22,100 --> 03:27:22,820
Oh god.

6849
03:27:22,960 --> 03:27:24,240
We were like scolding our chat.

6850
03:27:25,060 --> 03:27:27,180
There's always hole in the bed.

6851
03:27:28,560 --> 03:27:28,920
606.

6852
03:27:29,160 --> 03:27:30,100
Oh my god, that's 10 away.

6853
03:27:30,620 --> 03:27:31,420
Oh my god.

6854
03:27:31,600 --> 03:27:32,120
Wait, what?

6855
03:27:32,940 --> 03:27:35,320
I was gonna say 10 away from 666.

6856
03:27:35,660 --> 03:27:36,900
Yeah, I was gonna say.

6857
03:27:37,680 --> 03:27:38,040
Wait.

6858
03:27:38,180 --> 03:27:38,500
Wait.

6859
03:27:38,500 --> 03:27:38,780
Look!

6860
03:27:38,820 --> 03:27:38,980
Look!

6861
03:27:39,040 --> 03:27:39,100
Look!

6862
03:27:39,480 --> 03:27:40,300
Brother!

6863
03:27:40,300 --> 03:27:40,300
Brother!

6864
03:27:40,380 --> 03:27:40,940
Brother is being polite!

6865
03:27:41,400 --> 03:27:42,460
Brother is...

6866
03:27:42,460 --> 03:27:46,860
Brother is talking to someone, I think.

6867
03:27:47,000 --> 03:27:47,460
Oh, brother.

6868
03:27:47,760 --> 03:27:48,240
Okay.

6869
03:27:48,440 --> 03:27:48,780
We're going.

6870
03:27:49,160 --> 03:27:52,460
Brother's been in this hospital a bit too long.

6871
03:27:53,100 --> 03:27:54,920
Brother finally is speaking.

6872
03:27:57,700 --> 03:27:59,020
Alright, up we go.

6873
03:27:59,740 --> 03:28:01,480
He's laying right now.

6874
03:28:01,480 --> 03:28:03,460
He's like flirty with whoever he's talking to.

6875
03:28:03,460 --> 03:28:04,440
I don't know who he's talking to.

6876
03:28:04,500 --> 03:28:05,140
He's like, hey.

6877
03:28:05,720 --> 03:28:06,280
I know.

6878
03:28:08,140 --> 03:28:09,120
I like...

6879
03:28:09,480 --> 03:28:11,160
I don't want that anomaly again if we fuck up.

6880
03:28:11,540 --> 03:28:14,820
I can't wait to get flirty brother back.

6881
03:28:15,460 --> 03:28:17,280
I miss flirty brother.

6882
03:28:18,460 --> 03:28:21,620
Um, there's Raiden in the operating room.

6883
03:28:21,880 --> 03:28:23,060
What the fuck is that?

6884
03:28:23,560 --> 03:28:24,400
I don't know.

6885
03:28:24,880 --> 03:28:25,860
Why is he huge?

6886
03:28:25,860 --> 03:28:27,820
I triple dog dare you to go see him.

6887
03:28:28,220 --> 03:28:29,320
Yeah, go up to him.

6888
03:28:29,540 --> 03:28:31,180
We gotta do this again if we...

6889
03:28:31,860 --> 03:28:33,260
No, not necessarily.

6890
03:28:34,040 --> 03:28:36,960
Wait, he just... She's like half clipped to the floor.

6891
03:28:38,480 --> 03:28:39,640
What's she gonna do?

6892
03:28:39,660 --> 03:28:40,780
Phase through and kill me?

6893
03:28:41,560 --> 03:28:42,420
She might.

6894
03:28:43,600 --> 03:28:44,440
I'm leaving.

6895
03:28:44,860 --> 03:28:45,080
Oh.

6896
03:28:45,840 --> 03:28:47,560
What happened to moral support?

6897
03:28:48,460 --> 03:28:50,280
I never said that.

6898
03:28:50,600 --> 03:28:53,580
Oh, now you're not gonna support me morally.

6899
03:28:55,240 --> 03:28:57,180
I'm never supported you morally.

6900
03:29:00,560 --> 03:29:01,520
I'm never supported you morally.

6901
03:29:01,680 --> 03:29:04,400
Raiden, turn off the game console.

6902
03:29:04,940 --> 03:29:05,260
Alright.

6903
03:29:05,760 --> 03:29:06,400
608.

6904
03:29:07,220 --> 03:29:08,320
We're getting there.

6905
03:29:08,380 --> 03:29:10,120
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo.

6906
03:29:16,280 --> 03:29:18,140
We're missing the monitor and the lab.

6907
03:29:18,460 --> 03:29:19,860
Uh, there's a baby in the...

6908
03:29:20,310 --> 03:29:21,040
There's a baby?

6909
03:29:21,340 --> 03:29:22,280
There's a child.

6910
03:29:25,000 --> 03:29:26,280
Baby in it out.

6911
03:29:27,040 --> 03:29:27,980
He's not moving.

6912
03:29:28,140 --> 03:29:28,400
Baby.

6913
03:29:28,940 --> 03:29:30,860
Wait, what?

6914
03:29:31,240 --> 03:29:32,460
He's counting down.

6915
03:29:32,720 --> 03:29:33,140
He's counting down.

6916
03:29:35,000 --> 03:29:35,500
93.

6917
03:29:37,880 --> 03:29:38,380
92.

6918
03:29:39,060 --> 03:29:41,160
Okay, we have like 100 seconds.

6919
03:29:42,360 --> 03:29:43,300
100 seconds.

6920
03:29:43,500 --> 03:29:45,180
Why does he sound like that though?

6921
03:29:47,140 --> 03:29:47,660
95.

6922
03:29:47,660 --> 03:29:48,180
94.

6923
03:29:49,220 --> 03:29:49,740
93.

6924
03:29:49,920 --> 03:29:51,820
Somebody put baby in the corner.

6925
03:29:53,580 --> 03:29:54,340
609, baby.

6926
03:29:54,960 --> 03:29:55,240
Woo.

6927
03:29:55,380 --> 03:29:56,520
Hopefully there's no baby.

6928
03:29:57,340 --> 03:29:58,620
Alright, we got one baby.

6929
03:29:58,740 --> 03:29:59,940
Every floor has a baby.

6930
03:30:00,780 --> 03:30:01,300
No.

6931
03:30:02,660 --> 03:30:04,140
No, nothing in the monitor.

6932
03:30:05,680 --> 03:30:07,020
Oh, I'm lagging.

6933
03:30:07,020 --> 03:30:07,540
I'm lagging.

6934
03:30:07,600 --> 03:30:08,040
Are you?

6935
03:30:08,180 --> 03:30:08,980
I think so.

6936
03:30:09,220 --> 03:30:09,820
I'm not.

6937
03:30:10,540 --> 03:30:11,300
Oh, maybe.

6938
03:30:11,340 --> 03:30:11,680
No, I'm not.

6939
03:30:12,360 --> 03:30:13,120
I bumped into you, maybe.

6940
03:30:13,500 --> 03:30:14,140
Oh, maybe.

6941
03:30:14,460 --> 03:30:15,340
Yeah, I'm okay.

6942
03:30:15,360 --> 03:30:16,500
I'm walking back and forth.

6943
03:30:16,900 --> 03:30:17,920
Okay, okay, nevermind.

6944
03:30:18,620 --> 03:30:19,140
Um...

6945
03:30:19,800 --> 03:30:21,160
We care about your health.

6946
03:30:21,160 --> 03:30:22,080
May, June, July.

6947
03:30:23,040 --> 03:30:24,520
Disease, history, mm.

6948
03:30:25,740 --> 03:30:26,660
I don't see anything.

6949
03:30:28,000 --> 03:30:29,780
I don't see anything either.

6950
03:30:30,360 --> 03:30:30,740
I don't see anything either.

6951
03:30:30,860 --> 03:30:32,200
Nothing on the labels.

6952
03:30:33,200 --> 03:30:35,280
All the labels are not 666.

6953
03:30:35,500 --> 03:30:35,920
All the labels are not 666.

6954
03:30:37,180 --> 03:30:38,540
I think we're fine.

6955
03:30:39,000 --> 03:30:39,680
I think we're fine.

6956
03:30:40,400 --> 03:30:42,160
Yay, we're at the closer door!

6957
03:30:44,020 --> 03:30:45,680
We're at the closer x-ray!

6958
03:30:45,820 --> 03:30:46,600
I'm trusting you.

6959
03:30:46,780 --> 03:30:47,440
I'm trusting you.

6960
03:30:48,600 --> 03:30:50,700
Okay, then you go back into the room then.

6961
03:30:54,280 --> 03:30:54,800
I'm scared.

6962
03:30:54,800 --> 03:30:57,080
Then you go back into the room.

6963
03:30:58,280 --> 03:30:59,140
I'm scared.

6964
03:31:02,440 --> 03:31:04,140
You're gonna trust me.

6965
03:31:04,240 --> 03:31:05,760
And you're not confident enough.

6966
03:31:06,720 --> 03:31:07,600
I'm scared.

6967
03:31:07,660 --> 03:31:08,160
I don't know.

6968
03:31:08,200 --> 03:31:08,700
I'm nervous.

6969
03:31:08,700 --> 03:31:08,900
I'm so nervous!

6970
03:31:09,500 --> 03:31:11,720
I feel like usually the things are...

6971
03:31:12,340 --> 03:31:13,200
I don't know.

6972
03:31:14,380 --> 03:31:15,200
Okay, I...

6973
03:31:15,200 --> 03:31:16,620
People are like, blood?

6974
03:31:16,920 --> 03:31:19,060
But like they're not even confident about it.

6975
03:31:19,280 --> 03:31:21,260
They're saying like, is that blood by the brother?

6976
03:31:21,380 --> 03:31:22,720
But I don't see anything at all.

6977
03:31:22,780 --> 03:31:23,880
There's blood by the brother?

6978
03:31:24,280 --> 03:31:25,140
I don't think so.

6979
03:31:25,280 --> 03:31:25,880
I think they're...

6980
03:31:25,880 --> 03:31:27,360
They're being way too specific.

6981
03:31:29,380 --> 03:31:30,420
Yeah, there's blood.

6982
03:31:30,600 --> 03:31:30,820
What?

6983
03:31:30,880 --> 03:31:31,620
What are you talking about?

6984
03:31:31,700 --> 03:31:31,880
Where?

6985
03:31:32,780 --> 03:31:33,220
Where?

6986
03:31:33,220 --> 03:31:34,300
Behind the brother?

6987
03:31:36,220 --> 03:31:37,440
There's no blood anywhere.

6988
03:31:38,700 --> 03:31:39,560
There's no blood by the...

6989
03:31:39,560 --> 03:31:40,520
Are we really...

6990
03:31:40,520 --> 03:31:41,960
On the cabinet door?

6991
03:31:42,900 --> 03:31:43,520
What?

6992
03:31:43,720 --> 03:31:44,340
What?

6993
03:31:45,800 --> 03:31:47,440
Okay, I'm pretty sure.

6994
03:31:47,460 --> 03:31:48,820
I'm so confused.

6995
03:31:48,840 --> 03:31:49,520
I am...

6996
03:31:49,520 --> 03:31:51,140
I am confused too.

6997
03:31:52,500 --> 03:31:53,120
Huh?

6998
03:31:53,420 --> 03:31:54,380
I'm trying to see.

6999
03:31:54,580 --> 03:31:57,180
I'm trying to look around to see if we missed anything.

7000
03:31:58,660 --> 03:32:00,300
Blood inside you.

7001
03:32:00,460 --> 03:32:01,240
That's a medic bag.

7002
03:32:01,240 --> 03:32:02,080
I'm dead.

7003
03:32:02,920 --> 03:32:05,240
Alright, that's ectoplasm.

7004
03:32:05,300 --> 03:32:06,240
Get it right.

7005
03:32:06,700 --> 03:32:07,480
Okay, okay.

7006
03:32:08,700 --> 03:32:09,140
Oh my god.

7007
03:32:09,460 --> 03:32:09,900
Okay.

7008
03:32:10,540 --> 03:32:12,360
I mean, if we get this right, it's 610.

7009
03:32:13,320 --> 03:32:13,760
Okay.

7010
03:32:14,040 --> 03:32:16,080
We just... just rip off the bandaid, man.

7011
03:32:16,180 --> 03:32:17,240
Just rip off the bandaid.

7012
03:32:21,360 --> 03:32:22,000
Come on.

7013
03:32:23,680 --> 03:32:25,000
Oh my god!

7014
03:32:25,820 --> 03:32:26,640
Thank god!

7015
03:32:26,680 --> 03:32:28,040
Oh thank god!

7016
03:32:28,200 --> 03:32:29,160
Oh my god!

7017
03:32:29,240 --> 03:32:29,500
Thank you!

7018
03:32:30,000 --> 03:32:30,340
Ah!

7019
03:32:31,140 --> 03:32:31,920
What just happened?

7020
03:32:32,160 --> 03:32:32,460
Oh.

7021
03:32:32,780 --> 03:32:33,220
Oh.

7022
03:32:33,260 --> 03:32:34,280
Um, hello?

7023
03:32:34,360 --> 03:32:34,880
Where are you?

7024
03:32:35,100 --> 03:32:35,880
Where are you?

7025
03:32:36,200 --> 03:32:37,360
I'm in exit 8!

7026
03:32:38,480 --> 03:32:39,040
No way.

7027
03:32:39,040 --> 03:32:39,940
You're in exit 8?

7028
03:32:40,040 --> 03:32:40,620
You got teleported?

7029
03:32:40,620 --> 03:32:41,700
Yes, I'm in exit 8!

7030
03:32:41,960 --> 03:32:43,040
You got teleported?

7031
03:32:43,060 --> 03:32:44,240
I wanna get teleported.

7032
03:32:44,260 --> 03:32:45,220
I'm in exit 8 too.

7033
03:32:46,140 --> 03:32:46,720
Oh, hey!

7034
03:32:49,960 --> 03:32:50,760
No way.

7035
03:32:50,800 --> 03:32:51,440
Keep left.

7036
03:32:51,980 --> 03:32:52,580
Oh, shoot.

7037
03:32:52,660 --> 03:32:52,860
Wait.

7038
03:32:52,920 --> 03:32:53,300
We're in exit 8!

7039
03:32:53,300 --> 03:32:55,280
Aren't we supposed to go backward if it's...

7040
03:32:55,280 --> 03:32:55,780
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

7041
03:32:55,780 --> 03:32:56,360
We go back.

7042
03:32:56,360 --> 03:32:57,640
We go back cause it's anomaly.

7043
03:32:58,100 --> 03:32:58,260
We go back.

7044
03:32:58,260 --> 03:32:59,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

7045
03:32:59,460 --> 03:32:59,840
Oh, there it is.

7046
03:32:59,900 --> 03:33:00,180
There it is.

7047
03:33:00,240 --> 03:33:00,600
There it is.

7048
03:33:00,660 --> 03:33:01,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7049
03:33:01,440 --> 03:33:01,920
There it is.

7050
03:33:03,220 --> 03:33:04,580
It's actually exit 8!

7051
03:33:04,580 --> 03:33:05,020
Oh my god.

7052
03:33:05,140 --> 03:33:07,340
We got easy guide to exit 8.

7053
03:33:07,840 --> 03:33:08,900
Oh, we're back.

7054
03:33:08,900 --> 03:33:09,020
Oh, we're back.

7055
03:33:09,960 --> 03:33:10,700
Wait, we're back?

7056
03:33:10,880 --> 03:33:11,460
Oh, we're back!

7057
03:33:11,680 --> 03:33:13,680
Okay, I think that's anomaly, guys.

7058
03:33:13,980 --> 03:33:15,080
I don't know about that one.

7059
03:33:16,380 --> 03:33:17,780
Is it the same dev?

7060
03:33:17,860 --> 03:33:19,420
No, it's a different dev.

7061
03:33:19,680 --> 03:33:20,620
It's a parody.

7062
03:33:21,040 --> 03:33:22,000
That's so funny.

7063
03:33:22,100 --> 03:33:23,080
That's so funny.

7064
03:33:23,080 --> 03:33:25,060
We got easy guide to exit 8.

7065
03:33:25,140 --> 03:33:27,840
Some of these, like, anomalies are pretty good.

7066
03:33:27,940 --> 03:33:29,280
Yeah, they're actually pretty funny.

7067
03:33:31,360 --> 03:33:32,020
Oh, wait.

7068
03:33:32,080 --> 03:33:32,760
I think I'm lagging.

7069
03:33:32,820 --> 03:33:33,380
I think this is lag.

7070
03:33:33,520 --> 03:33:33,840
Yeah, yeah.

7071
03:33:33,900 --> 03:33:34,460
Wait, is it?

7072
03:33:35,980 --> 03:33:37,580
Unless we just pushed each other weird.

7073
03:33:37,880 --> 03:33:38,680
Okay, I'm going inside.

7074
03:33:38,680 --> 03:33:39,000
Oh, I'm going inside.

7075
03:33:39,000 --> 03:33:39,100
Oh, wait.

7076
03:33:39,240 --> 03:33:39,480
I'm lagging.

7077
03:33:39,480 --> 03:33:39,880
No, no, no.

7078
03:33:39,940 --> 03:33:40,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7079
03:33:40,480 --> 03:33:40,860
It is.

7080
03:33:40,860 --> 03:33:41,100
It is.

7081
03:33:41,200 --> 03:33:41,380
Ooh.

7082
03:33:41,840 --> 03:33:42,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7083
03:33:43,080 --> 03:33:43,340
That's...

7084
03:33:43,340 --> 03:33:43,980
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

7085
03:33:44,180 --> 03:33:45,080
I'm trying to get out.

7086
03:33:45,180 --> 03:33:46,280
Let me out.

7087
03:33:46,400 --> 03:33:47,100
Let me out.

7088
03:33:47,100 --> 03:33:47,580
Let me out.

7089
03:33:47,600 --> 03:33:47,740
Let me out.

7090
03:33:47,740 --> 03:33:48,160
Let me out.

7091
03:33:48,160 --> 03:33:48,260
Let me out.

7092
03:33:48,760 --> 03:33:50,940
I see it pushes you back.

7093
03:33:54,740 --> 03:33:55,540
Oh, my god.

7094
03:33:57,680 --> 03:33:59,880
Oh, I still can't believe I got teleported to exit 8.

7095
03:34:00,100 --> 03:34:00,540
I know.

7096
03:34:00,540 --> 03:34:01,080
That was crazy.

7097
03:34:01,140 --> 03:34:01,920
That was a good one.

7098
03:34:01,920 --> 03:34:03,380
You didn't even want to join me.

7099
03:34:03,480 --> 03:34:04,240
I went in.

7100
03:34:04,440 --> 03:34:05,740
I went in.

7101
03:34:07,140 --> 03:34:07,460
Okay.

7102
03:34:08,120 --> 03:34:08,440
Let's see.

7103
03:34:09,000 --> 03:34:09,540
Is there any 666?

7104
03:34:10,000 --> 03:34:12,360
I'm now paranoid for any 666 references.

7105
03:34:13,360 --> 03:34:14,200
I know, right?

7106
03:34:14,300 --> 03:34:14,820
Oh, my god.

7107
03:34:14,900 --> 03:34:15,800
Ever since...

7108
03:34:15,800 --> 03:34:16,120
I know.

7109
03:34:16,340 --> 03:34:17,500
...room 515.

7110
03:34:19,560 --> 03:34:21,640
I'll never forget 515.

7111
03:34:21,640 --> 03:34:22,200
I'll never forgive.

7112
03:34:22,540 --> 03:34:23,460
Never forget.

7113
03:34:23,720 --> 03:34:24,340
915, 516.

7114
03:34:24,600 --> 03:34:26,480
I'll never forget 516.

7115
03:34:27,000 --> 03:34:28,880
This one looks good, I think.

7116
03:34:29,520 --> 03:34:30,260
Yeah, I think so, too.

7117
03:34:31,720 --> 03:34:33,000
Anything behind the brother?

7118
03:34:33,720 --> 03:34:34,920
Just for chat's sake.

7119
03:34:34,920 --> 03:34:35,880
Where's the blood?

7120
03:34:37,340 --> 03:34:37,880
All right.

7121
03:34:37,960 --> 03:34:38,800
I think we're good.

7122
03:34:38,820 --> 03:34:38,980
I think we're good.

7123
03:34:39,000 --> 03:34:39,240
That's so much fun.

7124
03:34:39,240 --> 03:34:39,520
I'm fine.

7125
03:34:39,520 --> 03:34:39,600
Yeah.

7126
03:34:39,840 --> 03:34:40,240
Yeah.

7127
03:34:41,040 --> 03:34:41,580
All right.

7128
03:34:41,600 --> 03:34:42,520
Heading to the other side.

7129
03:34:42,740 --> 03:34:42,860
No.

7130
03:34:43,040 --> 03:34:44,560
We have to head to the other side.

7131
03:34:46,060 --> 03:34:47,380
Dokie checked the labels, right?

7132
03:34:47,500 --> 03:34:48,100
You checked the labels?

7133
03:34:50,080 --> 03:34:50,480
Sure.

7134
03:34:53,200 --> 03:34:55,540
Time to look at the numbers, Minx.

7135
03:34:55,760 --> 03:34:58,000
Time to look at the numbers.

7136
03:34:59,400 --> 03:35:02,780
Time to look at the...

7137
03:35:03,560 --> 03:35:04,360
I'm gained.

7138
03:35:04,360 --> 03:35:08,750
This is your fault.

7139
03:35:08,910 --> 03:35:10,110
How is it my fault?

7140
03:35:10,130 --> 03:35:10,230
Yeah.

7141
03:35:10,230 --> 03:35:10,610
This is your fault.

7142
03:35:10,710 --> 03:35:10,730
This is my fault.

7143
03:35:10,730 --> 03:35:10,770
I'm food.

7144
03:35:10,770 --> 03:35:10,830
This is food.

7145
03:35:10,830 --> 03:35:11,790
This is your fault!

7146
03:35:12,790 --> 03:35:13,730
This is your fault!

7147
03:35:13,890 --> 03:35:14,550
This is your fault!

7148
03:35:14,590 --> 03:35:15,070
This is your fault!

7149
03:35:15,070 --> 03:35:15,670
This is your fault!

7150
03:35:15,750 --> 03:35:16,570
You said you checked!

7151
03:35:18,470 --> 03:35:19,410
We're reviewing!

7152
03:35:19,610 --> 03:35:20,190
We're reviewing!

7153
03:35:20,730 --> 03:35:21,250
We're reviewing!

7154
03:35:21,250 --> 03:35:21,870
We're reviewing!

7155
03:35:22,370 --> 03:35:23,550
Oh my god...

7156
03:35:24,170 --> 03:35:25,950
We're not getting stuck in...

7157
03:35:25,950 --> 03:35:28,610
We're not getting stuck in... What was it?

7158
03:35:28,710 --> 03:35:29,430
What was it?

7159
03:35:29,530 --> 03:35:29,850
The labels?

7160
03:35:30,470 --> 03:35:30,990
No?

7161
03:35:31,270 --> 03:35:31,730
They're fine.

7162
03:35:31,730 --> 03:35:32,330
Is it the x-rays?

7163
03:35:32,750 --> 03:35:34,950
Were they supposed to be closer together?

7164
03:35:35,450 --> 03:35:36,450
The calendar?

7165
03:35:36,610 --> 03:35:38,630
We care about your health.

7166
03:35:38,630 --> 03:35:39,710
I think that's what it says.

7167
03:35:39,870 --> 03:35:41,990
Is the x-rays supposed to be closer together?

7168
03:35:43,950 --> 03:35:44,650
Look up.

7169
03:35:44,710 --> 03:35:45,950
There's nothing up top.

7170
03:35:47,230 --> 03:35:48,250
What was it?

7171
03:35:50,610 --> 03:35:52,230
Wait, actually... the plugs?

7172
03:35:52,810 --> 03:35:54,490
Wait, what do you mean the plugs?

7173
03:35:55,010 --> 03:35:55,810
Oh my god...

7174
03:35:56,750 --> 03:35:57,230
Oh!

7175
03:35:58,010 --> 03:35:58,770
It's the walls.

7176
03:35:58,910 --> 03:35:59,450
It's the walls.

7177
03:36:00,430 --> 03:36:01,390
Oh my god!

7178
03:36:01,390 --> 03:36:02,190
I just saw them!

7179
03:36:02,530 --> 03:36:04,230
That is so cheeky!

7180
03:36:04,650 --> 03:36:05,610
Oh my god!

7181
03:36:07,190 --> 03:36:08,190
It doesn't appear!

7182
03:36:08,630 --> 03:36:09,310
Oh!

7183
03:36:11,170 --> 03:36:12,570
They're making it really obvious.

7184
03:36:13,410 --> 03:36:14,950
I can't believe we didn't see that!

7185
03:36:16,410 --> 03:36:18,050
Oh my god!

7186
03:36:18,510 --> 03:36:19,770
Oh my god!

7187
03:36:21,370 --> 03:36:22,410
We're at six!

7188
03:36:22,410 --> 03:36:24,510
It's because they don't appear soon enough!

7189
03:36:24,730 --> 03:36:26,530
They don't appear soon enough.

7190
03:36:26,530 --> 03:36:28,590
Oh no... Alright, go to the other one.

7191
03:36:29,070 --> 03:36:29,630
Speedrunnersbane.

7192
03:36:30,330 --> 03:36:30,890
Zero.

7193
03:36:30,970 --> 03:36:31,630
This is zero.

7194
03:36:32,170 --> 03:36:35,350
Give it up for the four hours!

7195
03:36:35,450 --> 03:36:36,890
We're gonna make it!

7196
03:36:37,630 --> 03:36:38,190
We're gonna make it!

7197
03:36:38,630 --> 03:36:40,610
Oh my god, you're actually right!

7198
03:36:41,690 --> 03:36:42,490
Four hours!

7199
03:36:42,510 --> 03:36:44,310
Four hours of this game!

7200
03:36:46,650 --> 03:36:49,110
Give it up for hour number four!

7201
03:36:51,250 --> 03:36:51,650
No...

7202
03:36:53,650 --> 03:36:55,970
Okay, we got majority anomalies this time.

7203
03:36:56,230 --> 03:36:57,170
Yeah, it's true.

7204
03:36:57,630 --> 03:37:00,470
We get to see Flirty Guy again.

7205
03:37:00,470 --> 03:37:02,190
Oh yeah, we get to see Flirty Brother again!

7206
03:37:02,750 --> 03:37:03,950
I miss Flirty Brother.

7207
03:37:05,110 --> 03:37:06,350
Wait, it's the same.

7208
03:37:06,510 --> 03:37:06,970
Maybe it's a win.

7209
03:37:07,130 --> 03:37:07,390
It's the walls.

7210
03:37:07,570 --> 03:37:07,890
It's the walls.

7211
03:37:07,930 --> 03:37:08,550
Oh wait, it's the walls.

7212
03:37:09,210 --> 03:37:09,890
Are you sure?

7213
03:37:10,030 --> 03:37:10,170
Yeah.

7214
03:37:10,270 --> 03:37:10,950
Oh, you're right!

7215
03:37:11,010 --> 03:37:12,190
Yeah, it is the walls.

7216
03:37:12,470 --> 03:37:13,410
Good, good, good.

7217
03:37:13,410 --> 03:37:14,230
We got it out of the way.

7218
03:37:14,250 --> 03:37:15,130
I got it out of the way.

7219
03:37:15,230 --> 03:37:17,110
I was like, are my eyes deceiving me?

7220
03:37:17,190 --> 03:37:17,610
Because I...

7221
03:37:18,130 --> 03:37:19,450
Because we went through that.

7222
03:37:23,070 --> 03:37:24,210
Oh my god...

7223
03:37:24,210 --> 03:37:24,670
Oh my god...

7224
03:37:25,130 --> 03:37:29,190
In another world, it would have been like five floors left.

7225
03:37:29,290 --> 03:37:30,330
In another world...

7226
03:37:30,330 --> 03:37:33,210
Why couldn't they be the first one last time too?

7227
03:37:33,390 --> 03:37:33,730
Right?

7228
03:37:34,010 --> 03:37:35,410
Anomaly, Anomaly, come over here.

7229
03:37:35,750 --> 03:37:36,590
I'm speedrunning.

7230
03:37:36,650 --> 03:37:37,110
I see it.

7231
03:37:37,210 --> 03:37:37,790
I saw it.

7232
03:37:37,830 --> 03:37:38,330
Then monitor.

7233
03:37:38,630 --> 03:37:39,630
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

7234
03:37:39,830 --> 03:37:41,450
Hey, we get to do Exit 8 again!

7235
03:37:42,070 --> 03:37:42,870
Oh yeah!

7236
03:37:43,670 --> 03:37:44,490
That was fun.

7237
03:37:44,750 --> 03:37:44,990
Yeah.

7238
03:37:45,350 --> 03:37:46,570
I wonder if it would be the same one.

7239
03:37:46,730 --> 03:37:47,610
The same Anomaly.

7240
03:37:48,110 --> 03:37:48,930
With the poster.

7241
03:37:49,370 --> 03:37:50,010
Oh, maybe.

7242
03:37:50,630 --> 03:37:51,370
Probably, right?

7243
03:37:51,570 --> 03:37:51,970
Yeah, probably.

7244
03:37:52,030 --> 03:37:53,870
Unless they coded, like, several.

7245
03:37:54,470 --> 03:37:56,710
The one I don't want... I don't like the lagging one.

7246
03:37:56,770 --> 03:37:57,450
It hurts my brain.

7247
03:37:57,690 --> 03:37:59,130
Oh, the lagging one was freaky.

7248
03:37:59,850 --> 03:38:00,850
There's no 666.

7249
03:38:01,170 --> 03:38:03,610
Because we're missing some Anomaly's that we haven't got.

7250
03:38:03,870 --> 03:38:04,130
Yeah.

7251
03:38:04,270 --> 03:38:05,010
There's a few.

7252
03:38:05,670 --> 03:38:06,710
So like, I'm worried.

7253
03:38:07,270 --> 03:38:08,430
But I think this one's okay.

7254
03:38:08,530 --> 03:38:08,610
I don't think so.

7255
03:38:08,630 --> 03:38:10,310
Yeah, I think this one's okay.

7256
03:38:10,350 --> 03:38:10,630
I think we're good.

7257
03:38:10,890 --> 03:38:11,410
Yeah.

7258
03:38:11,810 --> 03:38:13,190
To the next floor!

7259
03:38:14,590 --> 03:38:15,630
Next floor!

7260
03:38:26,490 --> 03:38:27,390
I won.

7261
03:38:30,510 --> 03:38:31,550
Discord lag.

7262
03:38:37,870 --> 03:38:38,990
Alright, here we go.

7263
03:38:39,490 --> 03:38:40,770
I didn't realize this was a competition.

7264
03:38:41,150 --> 03:38:43,390
You held your note for a long time.

7265
03:38:43,430 --> 03:38:45,350
I assumed that we were trying to beat you.

7266
03:38:45,790 --> 03:38:47,570
No, I mean, that's...

7267
03:38:47,870 --> 03:38:49,490
That's what you would assume, isn't it?

7268
03:38:50,210 --> 03:38:52,170
No 666 on the floor.

7269
03:38:52,270 --> 03:38:53,010
No baby.

7270
03:38:53,210 --> 03:38:55,870
No baby and nothing seems odd.

7271
03:38:56,070 --> 03:38:57,150
No hole in the...

7272
03:38:57,150 --> 03:38:59,290
No hole in the thing.

7273
03:38:59,830 --> 03:39:01,070
Yeah, I think we're fine.

7274
03:39:01,450 --> 03:39:02,350
I think we're good.

7275
03:39:02,610 --> 03:39:03,110
Yeah, we're good.

7276
03:39:03,850 --> 03:39:04,590
Are we?

7277
03:39:04,830 --> 03:39:05,350
Yeah!

7278
03:39:07,590 --> 03:39:08,110
Ceiling?

7279
03:39:08,210 --> 03:39:09,130
What's wrong with the ceiling?

7280
03:39:09,570 --> 03:39:10,870
They always say ceiling.

7281
03:39:11,110 --> 03:39:12,070
They really do.

7282
03:39:12,790 --> 03:39:13,690
They always do.

7283
03:39:14,450 --> 03:39:16,430
They never stop with the ceiling.

7284
03:39:17,330 --> 03:39:18,950
They never stop with the ceiling.

7285
03:39:20,350 --> 03:39:21,410
Alright, here we go.

7286
03:39:21,690 --> 03:39:22,390
Okay, here we go.

7287
03:39:22,530 --> 03:39:23,110
We're so close.

7288
03:39:23,310 --> 03:39:24,190
6-0-5!

7289
03:39:24,510 --> 03:39:26,390
Less than... more than 10 left.

7290
03:39:27,070 --> 03:39:27,970
11 left.

7291
03:39:28,310 --> 03:39:29,510
Go, go, go, go.

7292
03:39:29,610 --> 03:39:30,510
Go, go, go, brother.

7293
03:39:31,030 --> 03:39:32,450
Nothing, no cables.

7294
03:39:33,950 --> 03:39:34,810
Everything's fine.

7295
03:39:35,010 --> 03:39:36,350
No sixes.

7296
03:39:37,110 --> 03:39:38,310
Care about your health.

7297
03:39:38,890 --> 03:39:39,850
Labels are fine.

7298
03:39:40,370 --> 03:39:41,210
May, June, July.

7299
03:39:41,350 --> 03:39:42,070
No history.

7300
03:39:43,690 --> 03:39:44,230
Ceiling, nothing.

7301
03:39:44,430 --> 03:39:45,790
It says exit here.

7302
03:39:46,710 --> 03:39:47,530
I think we're good.

7303
03:39:47,610 --> 03:39:48,570
There's no hole in the wall.

7304
03:39:48,770 --> 03:39:49,110
Let's go.

7305
03:39:49,570 --> 03:39:50,010
Really?

7306
03:39:50,190 --> 03:39:51,090
Two in a row?

7307
03:39:51,330 --> 03:39:51,950
Two in a row.

7308
03:39:52,230 --> 03:39:53,950
The game's being nice to us.

7309
03:39:54,370 --> 03:39:54,950
Let's go.

7310
03:39:55,230 --> 03:39:56,070
Okay, okay, okay.

7311
03:39:57,210 --> 03:39:59,650
I'm worried about the one thing that's like...

7312
03:39:59,650 --> 03:40:01,910
Because we haven't seen three anomalies.

7313
03:40:02,310 --> 03:40:02,970
Yeah, I know.

7314
03:40:02,970 --> 03:40:05,490
So it's like, what could the three...

7315
03:40:06,110 --> 03:40:07,490
What could the three be?

7316
03:40:07,490 --> 03:40:08,170
6-0-6!

7317
03:40:09,010 --> 03:40:09,450
Yes!

7318
03:40:09,450 --> 03:40:11,010
10 more!

7319
03:40:11,250 --> 03:40:13,690
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run!

7320
03:40:17,900 --> 03:40:18,300
It's...

7321
03:40:18,300 --> 03:40:19,260
Zesty Brother!

7322
03:40:19,620 --> 03:40:20,380
Wait, no, never mind.

7323
03:40:20,720 --> 03:40:22,480
Oh, it's the monitor, it's the monitor!

7324
03:40:23,340 --> 03:40:24,100
Oh, the monitor.

7325
03:40:24,140 --> 03:40:24,440
Again?

7326
03:40:24,440 --> 03:40:25,740
Didn't we get the monitor before?

7327
03:40:26,920 --> 03:40:28,160
There's two different ones, right?

7328
03:40:28,360 --> 03:40:28,920
There was?

7329
03:40:29,420 --> 03:40:30,080
I think so.

7330
03:40:30,340 --> 03:40:31,080
How did we not...

7331
03:40:31,080 --> 03:40:32,620
I thought we already did the brother.

7332
03:40:33,540 --> 03:40:34,980
Not the brother, the monitor.

7333
03:40:35,280 --> 03:40:37,120
Yeah, I thought we already did the monitor.

7334
03:40:38,160 --> 03:40:39,480
Let's hear Smoker Baby!

7335
03:40:40,500 --> 03:40:42,440
I think the next one will be the baby!

7336
03:40:42,580 --> 03:40:43,220
Baby in the corner!

7337
03:40:43,460 --> 03:40:44,460
Baby in the corner!

7338
03:40:44,800 --> 03:40:45,660
Baby in the corner!

7339
03:40:45,820 --> 03:40:48,080
Baby, baby, baby.

7340
03:40:48,300 --> 03:40:49,520
Oh, a predator is too.

7341
03:40:49,720 --> 03:40:50,120
Nice.

7342
03:40:50,260 --> 03:40:50,540
Okay.

7343
03:40:50,960 --> 03:40:52,840
Because I was like, I don't remember seeing two.

7344
03:40:53,160 --> 03:40:54,340
Oh, no baby in the corner.

7345
03:40:54,340 --> 03:40:55,100
It's a cable, it's a cable.

7346
03:40:55,720 --> 03:40:56,620
6-6-6.

7347
03:40:57,360 --> 03:41:00,120
Why can't it be the closer elevator, goddammit!

7348
03:41:00,620 --> 03:41:02,440
Goddammit, give us the closer one!

7349
03:41:04,460 --> 03:41:06,200
Wow, someone's so slow today.

7350
03:41:06,720 --> 03:41:09,460
Nah, I have a bug that's flying in my face.

7351
03:41:10,440 --> 03:41:11,320
Oh no.

7352
03:41:12,060 --> 03:41:14,540
Does the bug know about 6-6-6?

7353
03:41:14,840 --> 03:41:15,700
I killed it.

7354
03:41:15,980 --> 03:41:17,380
Oh, what, with your hand?

7355
03:41:17,660 --> 03:41:18,540
I thought you were a ghost!

7356
03:41:18,860 --> 03:41:19,800
I killed it just now.

7357
03:41:19,840 --> 03:41:20,660
Is it a ghost bug?

7358
03:41:22,440 --> 03:41:23,340
It is now.

7359
03:41:26,440 --> 03:41:27,220
Nothing here.

7360
03:41:27,640 --> 03:41:28,300
Oh, it's the lady!

7361
03:41:28,460 --> 03:41:29,180
It's Raiden!

7362
03:41:30,220 --> 03:41:31,380
Raiden, Raiden, Raiden!

7363
03:41:31,380 --> 03:41:32,720
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

7364
03:41:32,980 --> 03:41:34,440
Turn off the game console!

7365
03:41:36,660 --> 03:41:37,760
Oh my god.

7366
03:41:38,400 --> 03:41:39,460
Oh my god, we're doing it again.

7367
03:41:39,480 --> 03:41:40,460
We're doing it, we're doing it well.

7368
03:41:40,460 --> 03:41:41,940
We're speedrunning, we're so good now!

7369
03:41:42,720 --> 03:41:43,160
Woooo!

7370
03:41:45,600 --> 03:41:46,240
It's okay.

7371
03:41:46,380 --> 03:41:47,140
6-0-9!

7372
03:41:48,740 --> 03:41:49,420
Seven more!

7373
03:41:50,200 --> 03:41:50,880
Oh my god.

7374
03:41:53,320 --> 03:41:55,360
Zesty brother, zesty brother, zesty brother.

7375
03:41:55,700 --> 03:41:56,140
Nope.

7376
03:41:56,260 --> 03:41:56,580
Nope.

7377
03:41:56,640 --> 03:41:56,820
Baby?

7378
03:41:57,100 --> 03:41:57,540
Nope.

7379
03:41:57,900 --> 03:41:59,620
Hole in the bed, hole in the bed, hole in the bed!

7380
03:42:00,080 --> 03:42:00,620
Let's go, let's go!

7381
03:42:01,940 --> 03:42:03,660
We punch each other.

7382
03:42:04,440 --> 03:42:05,280
Get out!

7383
03:42:05,280 --> 03:42:07,260
We need to get to 6-6-6!

7384
03:42:11,720 --> 03:42:13,840
We're like, okay we found it, go, go, go!

7385
03:42:13,860 --> 03:42:14,360
Go, go, go, go!

7386
03:42:16,560 --> 03:42:16,960
Alright.

7387
03:42:17,240 --> 03:42:18,100
There we go.

7388
03:42:18,380 --> 03:42:22,040
I wonder if you failed the exit 8, do I lose?

7389
03:42:22,900 --> 03:42:23,680
I don't know.

7390
03:42:24,600 --> 03:42:25,720
Like before, right?

7391
03:42:25,920 --> 03:42:27,380
Yeah, yeah, cause we got it right before.

7392
03:42:27,900 --> 03:42:28,920
We still have the lag.

7393
03:42:29,220 --> 03:42:29,800
No baby.

7394
03:42:30,180 --> 03:42:30,760
Wait, the camera.

7395
03:42:30,960 --> 03:42:31,700
What the fuck?

7396
03:42:32,020 --> 03:42:33,680
Oh, I saw it, I saw it!

7397
03:42:33,740 --> 03:42:34,060
Oh!

7398
03:42:34,260 --> 03:42:36,100
Oh my god, that's so weird.

7399
03:42:36,100 --> 03:42:39,020
That's like the camera, the dead POV.

7400
03:42:39,640 --> 03:42:40,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7401
03:42:41,140 --> 03:42:42,160
Well that's kinda fun.

7402
03:42:42,520 --> 03:42:43,400
Yeah, that's fun.

7403
03:42:43,780 --> 03:42:44,160
Alright.

7404
03:42:44,800 --> 03:42:48,220
Someone needs to work out more there.

7405
03:42:48,520 --> 03:42:49,840
I was looking at it!

7406
03:42:50,220 --> 03:42:51,720
I was looking at it!

7407
03:42:52,000 --> 03:42:54,120
Do not wanna leave the hospital!

7408
03:42:56,280 --> 03:42:57,840
I'm enjoying my time!

7409
03:42:57,960 --> 03:42:59,200
It's literally a camera.

7410
03:43:00,300 --> 03:43:00,780
Alright.

7411
03:43:02,260 --> 03:43:05,260
Zesty brother, zesty brother, zesty brother, zesty brother, zesty brother, zesty brother, zesty brother.

7412
03:43:05,260 --> 03:43:06,080
Maybe in the corner, maybe in the corner.

7413
03:43:06,100 --> 03:43:07,460
Maybe in the corner, maybe in the corner.

7414
03:43:07,620 --> 03:43:08,720
Baby in the corner!

7415
03:43:08,940 --> 03:43:13,080
Baby in the corner, we just have brother and exit 8.

7416
03:43:13,980 --> 03:43:14,560
Baby in the corner, we just have brother and exit 8.

7417
03:43:14,560 --> 03:43:16,280
And that's all the ones we've seen, right?

7418
03:43:16,620 --> 03:43:16,780
And that's all the ones we've seen, right?

7419
03:43:16,860 --> 03:43:17,440
Yeah.

7420
03:43:19,640 --> 03:43:20,220
99.

7421
03:43:21,870 --> 03:43:27,980
Are you f- I was like, where did you go?

7422
03:43:28,980 --> 03:43:29,560
92.

7423
03:43:29,820 --> 03:43:30,400
92.

7424
03:43:31,460 --> 03:43:32,040
89.

7425
03:43:36,810 --> 03:43:37,970
What happened?

7426
03:43:38,050 --> 03:43:38,710
That's because we count to zero.

7427
03:43:39,430 --> 03:43:40,330
That's what I'm wondering.

7428
03:43:40,910 --> 03:43:43,230
I swear to god, I swear to god.

7429
03:43:43,250 --> 03:43:44,490
We have to go back to 6.

7430
03:43:44,710 --> 03:43:45,950
Will it be worth it?

7431
03:43:49,050 --> 03:43:50,630
You want me in the elevator?

7432
03:43:50,970 --> 03:43:52,550
You want me in the elevator?

7433
03:43:52,670 --> 03:43:54,090
You want me in the elevator?

7434
03:43:54,090 --> 03:43:55,050
You want me in the elevator?

7435
03:43:56,710 --> 03:43:58,110
Go closer to that room!

7436
03:43:58,330 --> 03:43:58,950
Go closer!

7437
03:44:00,630 --> 03:44:02,530
What did he say?

7438
03:44:03,310 --> 03:44:03,910
What did he say?

7439
03:44:04,510 --> 03:44:04,910
What?

7440
03:44:04,910 --> 03:44:05,490
He stopped clowning.

7441
03:44:05,770 --> 03:44:07,550
I don't think he expects us to stay here.

7442
03:44:07,750 --> 03:44:08,390
I don't think he does.

7443
03:44:09,410 --> 03:44:10,990
He just stomps at them.

7444
03:44:10,990 --> 03:44:11,710
He got lazy!

7445
03:44:12,030 --> 03:44:13,290
I told you, lazy Dev!

7446
03:44:13,330 --> 03:44:13,930
Lazy Dev!

7447
03:44:14,650 --> 03:44:18,130
He doesn't even fucking count all the way to the end!

7448
03:44:18,310 --> 03:44:20,630
If you don't get counted all the way to the end, start from 10!

7449
03:44:22,490 --> 03:44:23,570
I know, right?

7450
03:44:24,530 --> 03:44:25,750
Dev got tired.

7451
03:44:26,250 --> 03:44:28,110
He was like, well you're supposed to be gone.

7452
03:44:28,350 --> 03:44:28,830
Oh, oh.

7453
03:44:29,030 --> 03:44:29,450
Exit A?

7454
03:44:29,810 --> 03:44:30,590
Yeah, exit A.

7455
03:44:30,590 --> 03:44:30,650
Exit A.

7456
03:44:30,650 --> 03:44:31,950
Okay, I'm gonna see if you...

7457
03:44:33,390 --> 03:44:38,210
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

7458
03:44:38,430 --> 03:44:38,790
What?

7459
03:44:39,130 --> 03:44:40,630
I wanna see you pop into existence.

7460
03:44:41,810 --> 03:44:43,070
Oh, okay, okay, I can do that.

7461
03:44:43,190 --> 03:44:43,630
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

7462
03:44:43,910 --> 03:44:45,810
Oh my god, it's an anomaly!

7463
03:44:46,170 --> 03:44:46,850
Is it the same one?

7464
03:44:47,410 --> 03:44:48,390
Yeah, it's the same one.

7465
03:44:48,390 --> 03:44:48,810
Oh, okay.

7466
03:44:49,050 --> 03:44:50,970
Let's see what you look like when you pop back in.

7467
03:44:52,570 --> 03:44:53,250
Here I go.

7468
03:44:54,870 --> 03:44:55,510
Where are you?

7469
03:44:56,090 --> 03:44:56,830
I'm coming back.

7470
03:44:56,990 --> 03:44:57,690
Oh, I'm here.

7471
03:45:00,710 --> 03:45:01,650
It's this way.

7472
03:45:01,850 --> 03:45:02,610
Oh, it's this way.

7473
03:45:05,290 --> 03:45:07,770
He just popped beside me.

7474
03:45:10,430 --> 03:45:11,690
Okay, up we go.

7475
03:45:12,470 --> 03:45:13,390
Who are we missing?

7476
03:45:13,930 --> 03:45:14,010
Three more!

7477
03:45:14,310 --> 03:45:16,030
Oh, we're missing Zesty Brother.

7478
03:45:16,270 --> 03:45:17,470
Oh, and then I think two others, right?

7479
03:45:17,490 --> 03:45:18,690
Yeah, two others we haven't seen before.

7480
03:45:18,910 --> 03:45:18,930
Oh, and Lag.

7481
03:45:19,210 --> 03:45:19,930
I don't think we got the Lag one yet.

7482
03:45:19,930 --> 03:45:20,910
Oh, we didn't get the Lag one.

7483
03:45:21,010 --> 03:45:24,250
Okay, so then we have one anomaly that we haven't got before.

7484
03:45:25,290 --> 03:45:25,690
Alright.

7485
03:45:26,110 --> 03:45:27,950
Okay, okay, okay, we got this, we got this.

7486
03:45:29,390 --> 03:45:29,790
Nope.

7487
03:45:29,870 --> 03:45:30,470
Oh, oh, oh!

7488
03:45:30,650 --> 03:45:31,250
Is it Lag?

7489
03:45:32,070 --> 03:45:33,310
No, no, no, look, look, look.

7490
03:45:34,070 --> 03:45:35,910
It's like unfinished textures.

7491
03:45:35,990 --> 03:45:36,330
No textures.

7492
03:45:36,510 --> 03:45:36,930
Oh yeah!

7493
03:45:37,050 --> 03:45:38,510
Oh, everything has no textures!

7494
03:45:38,990 --> 03:45:39,570
Oh my god!

7495
03:45:39,890 --> 03:45:42,690
Oh, so everything has to be anomaly now.

7496
03:45:43,530 --> 03:45:44,410
Everything is a PNG.

7497
03:45:44,910 --> 03:45:45,550
No, no, no.

7498
03:45:46,230 --> 03:45:46,990
Okay, 14.

7499
03:45:47,130 --> 03:45:48,370
Oh wait, no, we're missing one.

7500
03:45:48,570 --> 03:45:50,450
No, I think it's better to... yeah.

7501
03:45:50,870 --> 03:45:52,310
We're missing one because we have...

7502
03:45:52,310 --> 03:45:53,950
We have to check.

7503
03:45:53,950 --> 03:45:54,610
We have done two, so...

7504
03:45:54,610 --> 03:45:55,850
Yeah, yeah, we have to check.

7505
03:45:56,010 --> 03:45:56,730
Okay, it's fine.

7506
03:45:57,730 --> 03:45:58,290
Lazy Dev.

7507
03:46:01,510 --> 03:46:02,350
Alright, here we go.

7508
03:46:02,370 --> 03:46:02,950
My immersion!

7509
03:46:03,130 --> 03:46:04,870
This isn't a video game, this is real life.

7510
03:46:04,890 --> 03:46:05,830
I'm stuck in the game, please help!

7511
03:46:05,830 --> 03:46:06,650
Yeah, we're stuck in the hospital!

7512
03:46:08,210 --> 03:46:08,870
It's the brother!

7513
03:46:08,890 --> 03:46:09,310
Zesty Brother!

7514
03:46:09,530 --> 03:46:10,010
Zesty Brother!

7515
03:46:11,050 --> 03:46:12,310
He's having a good time.

7516
03:46:12,710 --> 03:46:13,190
Okay, nice.

7517
03:46:13,190 --> 03:46:14,750
Okay, Lag and then...

7518
03:46:15,270 --> 03:46:15,630
Unknown.

7519
03:46:17,990 --> 03:46:18,350
Alright.

7520
03:46:18,650 --> 03:46:19,390
Off we go.

7521
03:46:19,510 --> 03:46:21,310
Not... we didn't take the wrong elevator too.

7522
03:46:21,370 --> 03:46:21,810
We did it.

7523
03:46:21,890 --> 03:46:22,070
No.

7524
03:46:22,150 --> 03:46:23,910
We didn't take the wrong elevator.

7525
03:46:23,910 --> 03:46:24,830
We're good.

7526
03:46:24,910 --> 03:46:25,990
We got this, we got this, we got this.

7527
03:46:26,110 --> 03:46:26,590
We got this, we got this.

7528
03:46:26,990 --> 03:46:29,010
How we can't fuck it up now?

7529
03:46:29,270 --> 03:46:30,670
It's gotta be the Lag, right?

7530
03:46:30,790 --> 03:46:31,790
Yeah, it has to be the Lag.

7531
03:46:32,050 --> 03:46:33,530
Or something else.

7532
03:46:33,790 --> 03:46:35,070
Or no anomaly.

7533
03:46:38,140 --> 03:46:40,960
Um, run around to see if we lag at all?

7534
03:46:41,620 --> 03:46:42,340
No lag.

7535
03:46:43,200 --> 03:46:44,080
Oh, wait.

7536
03:46:44,180 --> 03:46:45,600
I don't like this because we don't...

7537
03:46:45,600 --> 03:46:46,540
We don't know.

7538
03:46:46,760 --> 03:46:47,300
We don't know.

7539
03:46:47,360 --> 03:46:48,220
We don't know.

7540
03:46:48,260 --> 03:46:49,080
We don't know.

7541
03:46:49,440 --> 03:46:51,280
Wait, I don't like this because it's not lag.

7542
03:46:51,420 --> 03:46:52,920
It's too much of a mystery!

7543
03:46:53,460 --> 03:46:54,380
This is a mystery.

7544
03:46:54,880 --> 03:46:55,540
Any success?

7545
03:46:55,560 --> 03:46:55,880
The labels?

7546
03:46:55,880 --> 03:46:56,900
The labels are fine.

7547
03:46:56,900 --> 03:46:57,700
Looking at the calendar.

7548
03:46:58,600 --> 03:46:59,840
Medical center first.

7549
03:46:59,900 --> 03:47:00,780
We care about your health.

7550
03:47:01,320 --> 03:47:02,160
May, June, July.

7551
03:47:02,220 --> 03:47:03,040
There's no 666.

7552
03:47:03,400 --> 03:47:04,160
Oh no.

7553
03:47:04,520 --> 03:47:06,520
Nothing with the table, the bed.

7554
03:47:07,180 --> 03:47:08,180
Disease history.

7555
03:47:09,000 --> 03:47:10,180
There's no 6 rays.

7556
03:47:10,660 --> 03:47:12,220
Nothing with the x-rays.

7557
03:47:12,300 --> 03:47:13,540
They all look the same.

7558
03:47:13,780 --> 03:47:15,620
The walls aren't smiling this time.

7559
03:47:15,980 --> 03:47:16,340
No.

7560
03:47:16,660 --> 03:47:18,060
I don't like this, Mint.

7561
03:47:18,260 --> 03:47:19,960
I don't like this either.

7562
03:47:20,300 --> 03:47:22,560
The wall was the first one we got.

7563
03:47:22,580 --> 03:47:23,020
Yeah.

7564
03:47:23,120 --> 03:47:24,640
The x-rays are okay.

7565
03:47:25,560 --> 03:47:26,180
There's no 666.

7566
03:47:26,180 --> 03:47:26,320
Nothing on the ceiling.

7567
03:47:29,040 --> 03:47:30,240
I don't know, man.

7568
03:47:30,240 --> 03:47:30,920
I don't know, man.

7569
03:47:30,940 --> 03:47:32,260
Is there no one behind Lisa's door?

7570
03:47:32,300 --> 03:47:33,180
I don't know, man.

7571
03:47:33,540 --> 03:47:34,760
I don't know, man.

7572
03:47:34,760 --> 03:47:34,920
I

7573
03:47:45,220 --> 03:47:46,580
think we're good.

7574
03:47:46,880 --> 03:47:47,240
Okay.

7575
03:47:47,880 --> 03:47:48,240
Okay.

7576
03:47:48,920 --> 03:47:49,820
I'll press the button.

7577
03:47:49,840 --> 03:47:50,380
I'll take the blame.

7578
03:47:51,580 --> 03:47:52,180
Wait, what?

7579
03:48:00,500 --> 03:48:01,020
It's a lag.

7580
03:48:01,120 --> 03:48:01,960
We don't have to do this.

7581
03:48:02,600 --> 03:48:03,980
Yeah, I said it's a lag.

7582
03:48:04,200 --> 03:48:04,560
A lag.

7583
03:48:04,560 --> 03:48:05,000
A lag.

7584
03:48:05,540 --> 03:48:06,860
I'm lagging in the elevator.

7585
03:48:08,800 --> 03:48:09,520
It's definitely...

7586
03:48:09,520 --> 03:48:10,120
This is it.

7587
03:48:10,200 --> 03:48:10,840
This is it.

7588
03:48:11,260 --> 03:48:12,080
Good luck, Mint.

7589
03:48:13,840 --> 03:48:14,280
Oh.

7590
03:48:15,500 --> 03:48:16,400
We're at the...

7591
03:48:16,400 --> 03:48:18,940
What floor are we at?

7592
03:48:19,640 --> 03:48:20,080
666!

7593
03:48:20,540 --> 03:48:21,060
We're here.

7594
03:48:21,420 --> 03:48:22,020
Here we go.

7595
03:48:23,100 --> 03:48:24,180
Just run for it.

7596
03:48:24,700 --> 03:48:25,360
Here we go.

7597
03:48:25,980 --> 03:48:26,660
There's no...

7598
03:48:26,660 --> 03:48:27,960
Wait, the elevator's not open though.

7599
03:48:28,280 --> 03:48:28,540
Yeah.

7600
03:48:29,640 --> 03:48:30,220
Uh-oh.

7601
03:48:31,280 --> 03:48:31,720
Oh.

7602
03:48:32,020 --> 03:48:32,460
Oh.

7603
03:48:32,520 --> 03:48:34,460
I think something is gonna come from that elevator.

7604
03:48:34,460 --> 03:48:35,720
No, but then like... Oh.

7605
03:48:36,060 --> 03:48:36,680
Maybe you're right.

7606
03:48:36,680 --> 03:48:37,380
I think we need to turn around.

7607
03:48:37,380 --> 03:48:38,360
I think you're right.

7608
03:48:38,380 --> 03:48:39,000
I think we need to turn around.

7609
03:48:39,080 --> 03:48:40,220
I think we need to turn around.

7610
03:48:40,780 --> 03:48:41,140
Oh.

7611
03:48:41,700 --> 03:48:42,060
Oh.

7612
03:48:42,060 --> 03:48:42,220
Whoa.

7613
03:48:42,480 --> 03:48:42,840
Whoa.

7614
03:48:42,840 --> 03:48:43,160
Whoa.

7615
03:48:43,160 --> 03:48:43,740
Was that a PNG?

7616
03:48:43,860 --> 03:48:44,980
Yeah, that was a PNG.

7617
03:48:46,400 --> 03:48:47,920
I think we just got a...

7618
03:48:47,920 --> 03:48:48,880
There's a wheelchair.

7619
03:48:49,160 --> 03:48:49,640
The sheet goes.

7620
03:48:49,900 --> 03:48:50,280
The sheet goes.

7621
03:48:50,280 --> 03:48:50,680
It's your cousin.

7622
03:48:50,880 --> 03:48:51,480
It's your cousin.

7623
03:48:51,680 --> 03:48:52,260
It's my cousin.

7624
03:48:52,800 --> 03:48:53,220
Let's run.

7625
03:48:54,340 --> 03:48:55,680
Oh, it's the body bag.

7626
03:48:55,680 --> 03:48:56,480
It's the body bag.

7627
03:48:56,620 --> 03:48:57,720
It's just a normal guy.

7628
03:48:57,940 --> 03:48:58,480
It's Anita.

7629
03:48:59,040 --> 03:49:00,080
It's a normal guy.

7630
03:49:00,220 --> 03:49:01,160
Oh my god.

7631
03:49:03,480 --> 03:49:04,500
How did I die?

7632
03:49:05,900 --> 03:49:06,920
How did you die?

7633
03:49:06,920 --> 03:49:07,960
I don't know.

7634
03:49:08,620 --> 03:49:10,300
I think we have to like...

7635
03:49:10,700 --> 03:49:12,740
As soon as it starts ringing, we gotta...

7636
03:49:12,740 --> 03:49:13,560
We gotta turn around.

7637
03:49:13,840 --> 03:49:14,520
Oh, that's true.

7638
03:49:15,040 --> 03:49:16,840
Wait, that means he's faster than us.

7639
03:49:16,960 --> 03:49:17,780
That's messed up.

7640
03:49:17,780 --> 03:49:17,900
Yeah, stop there.

7641
03:49:18,880 --> 03:49:19,280
Okay.

7642
03:49:19,380 --> 03:49:19,680
Okay.

7643
03:49:19,720 --> 03:49:19,940
There we go.

7644
03:49:20,120 --> 03:49:20,780
Turn around.

7645
03:49:20,800 --> 03:49:21,320
Turn around.

7646
03:49:21,460 --> 03:49:21,800
Turn around.

7647
03:49:22,140 --> 03:49:23,420
We wasted too much time.

7648
03:49:23,700 --> 03:49:24,580
No, no, no.

7649
03:49:25,860 --> 03:49:26,380
Don't stop.

7650
03:49:26,520 --> 03:49:27,040
Don't stop.

7651
03:49:27,120 --> 03:49:27,680
Don't look back.

7652
03:49:27,720 --> 03:49:28,540
Don't look back.

7653
03:49:28,860 --> 03:49:29,800
You're... You're... You're...

7654
03:49:29,800 --> 03:49:31,100
I'll punch you to victory.

7655
03:49:31,260 --> 03:49:31,920
I'll punch you.

7656
03:49:32,840 --> 03:49:34,560
I'll punch you if you get too close.

7657
03:49:35,040 --> 03:49:35,440
Okay.

7658
03:49:35,440 --> 03:49:35,780
Okay.

7659
03:49:35,780 --> 03:49:36,320
Punch me.

7660
03:49:36,380 --> 03:49:36,900
Punch me.

7661
03:49:36,920 --> 03:49:38,120
I'll punch you if you get too close.

7662
03:49:38,620 --> 03:49:39,340
Normal guy.

7663
03:49:39,500 --> 03:49:39,960
Normal guy.

7664
03:49:40,180 --> 03:49:40,540
Normal guy.

7665
03:49:40,540 --> 03:49:41,760
You're doing normal things.

7666
03:49:41,900 --> 03:49:42,360
Oh my god.

7667
03:49:42,900 --> 03:49:43,880
Are you punching me?

7668
03:49:43,920 --> 03:49:44,060
I'm punching.

7669
03:49:44,060 --> 03:49:44,740
Yes, I am.

7670
03:49:44,940 --> 03:49:45,580
Stop laughing.

7671
03:49:45,720 --> 03:49:46,580
I'm punching you.

7672
03:49:46,860 --> 03:49:47,740
I'm not laughing.

7673
03:49:48,020 --> 03:49:49,360
I'm doing my best.

7674
03:49:49,840 --> 03:49:50,620
Oh, it worked.

7675
03:49:50,640 --> 03:49:50,920
It worked.

7676
03:49:50,920 --> 03:49:51,100
It worked.

7677
03:49:51,140 --> 03:49:52,700
I'm doing my best.

7678
03:49:53,120 --> 03:49:53,800
Don't die.

7679
03:49:53,980 --> 03:49:54,560
Don't die.

7680
03:49:54,560 --> 03:49:55,900
I said I wouldn't do it.

7681
03:49:56,000 --> 03:49:56,820
I sacrificed my life.

7682
03:49:56,840 --> 03:49:58,000
I did everything I could.

7683
03:49:59,400 --> 03:50:00,120
I'm punching.

7684
03:50:02,260 --> 03:50:03,140
Oh my god.

7685
03:50:03,220 --> 03:50:03,620
It's a doctor.

7686
03:50:03,800 --> 03:50:04,200
Oh my god.

7687
03:50:04,200 --> 03:50:04,720
He's right there.

7688
03:50:04,780 --> 03:50:05,160
He's right there.

7689
03:50:05,160 --> 03:50:05,580
Holy shit.

7690
03:50:05,660 --> 03:50:06,580
He was right behind us.

7691
03:50:06,920 --> 03:50:08,280
We did it.

7692
03:50:10,520 --> 03:50:12,760
Complete normal mode.

7693
03:50:12,780 --> 03:50:13,900
Oh my god.

7694
03:50:13,980 --> 03:50:15,000
It was a doctor.

7695
03:50:15,700 --> 03:50:17,940
He wanted to get paid.

7696
03:50:18,200 --> 03:50:19,300
He wanted to get paid.

7697
03:50:19,300 --> 03:50:22,540
I like how this entire Critics is this one guy.

7698
03:50:22,820 --> 03:50:24,220
Marketing manager.

7699
03:50:24,540 --> 03:50:25,780
Cell manager.

7700
03:50:25,940 --> 03:50:26,740
Developer.

7701
03:50:27,120 --> 03:50:29,360
YouTube anomaly acting.

7702
03:50:30,060 --> 03:50:30,760
YouTube anomaly acting.

7703
03:50:31,520 --> 03:50:32,320
School666.

7704
03:50:32,780 --> 03:50:36,140
Oh, I know what we're playing next time.

7705
03:50:36,140 --> 03:50:36,840
Oh, I know what we're playing next time.

7706
03:50:36,920 --> 03:50:38,180
Oh my god.

7707
03:50:38,320 --> 03:50:40,180
Wait, are we going to classroom 6?

7708
03:50:40,220 --> 03:50:41,760
How are we gonna do... Is it gonna be floors?

7709
03:50:42,140 --> 03:50:43,680
Wasn't there an easy mode to this?

7710
03:50:43,840 --> 03:50:46,180
Yeah, the easy mode is that there's a routine.

7711
03:50:46,480 --> 03:50:46,940
So like...

7712
03:50:48,800 --> 03:50:49,320
Wait.

7713
03:50:49,320 --> 03:50:49,840
What?

7714
03:50:50,180 --> 03:50:51,120
Wait, we're still here.

7715
03:50:51,680 --> 03:50:55,120
I got an achievement too that was just like you escaped the hospital.

7716
03:50:55,180 --> 03:50:56,180
But have you really?

7717
03:50:56,520 --> 03:50:57,560
Wait, there's more?

7718
03:50:58,180 --> 03:50:59,800
Yeah, but like...

7719
03:51:00,740 --> 03:51:01,780
But like...

7720
03:51:01,780 --> 03:51:03,880
What is the hard... What?

7721
03:51:04,740 --> 03:51:05,660
What's the difference?

7722
03:51:06,340 --> 03:51:07,160
I don't know.

7723
03:51:08,080 --> 03:51:09,280
What's the difference, Mint?

7724
03:51:09,800 --> 03:51:10,560
I don't know.

7725
03:51:10,660 --> 03:51:11,200
I don't know.

7726
03:51:11,600 --> 03:51:12,440
Just keep going.

7727
03:51:12,660 --> 03:51:13,580
Just go to the next...

7728
03:51:13,580 --> 03:51:14,420
Go to the elevator.

7729
03:51:14,560 --> 03:51:14,940
It says exit.

7730
03:51:14,940 --> 03:51:16,100
I thought it was over.

7731
03:51:16,500 --> 03:51:17,100
It's fine.

7732
03:51:17,240 --> 03:51:17,800
Just keep going.

7733
03:51:17,860 --> 03:51:19,480
I thought it... But it's back to zero.

7734
03:51:19,900 --> 03:51:20,400
No, no.

7735
03:51:20,400 --> 03:51:21,440
It's back to zero.

7736
03:51:21,500 --> 03:51:22,040
It's fine.

7737
03:51:22,160 --> 03:51:22,760
We're fine.

7738
03:51:23,200 --> 03:51:24,420
It's back to zero.

7739
03:51:24,420 --> 03:51:25,060
It's all good.

7740
03:51:25,180 --> 03:51:25,580
It's all good.

7741
03:51:26,520 --> 03:51:27,220
Oh no.

7742
03:51:28,700 --> 03:51:29,540
I don't understand.

7743
03:51:30,840 --> 03:51:31,980
What would be different?

7744
03:51:34,920 --> 03:51:36,300
I think the game is over.

7745
03:51:36,480 --> 03:51:37,640
I think the game is over too.

7746
03:51:37,800 --> 03:51:38,300
I think...

7747
03:51:38,300 --> 03:51:41,460
I think there's a return to menu button up here.

7748
03:51:41,600 --> 03:51:42,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7749
03:51:42,160 --> 03:51:43,860
I see it too.

7750
03:51:44,000 --> 03:51:44,540
I see it.

7751
03:51:44,580 --> 03:51:45,640
You see that menu?

7752
03:51:45,760 --> 03:51:46,260
Oh my god.

7753
03:51:46,300 --> 03:51:47,060
It just showed up.

7754
03:51:47,260 --> 03:51:51,220
I got into the elevator and the return to menu button showed up.

7755
03:51:51,280 --> 03:51:51,340
I got into the elevator and the return to menu button showed up.

7756
03:51:51,340 --> 03:51:51,720
Did you see that?

7757
03:51:51,800 --> 03:51:53,220
Yeah, yeah.

7758
03:51:53,880 --> 03:51:55,420
Oh my... I'm in the menu.

7759
03:51:56,080 --> 03:51:57,260
Oh, you left.

7760
03:51:57,460 --> 03:51:59,320
No, it like showed up.

7761
03:52:00,040 --> 03:52:01,040
She's gone, you guys.

7762
03:52:01,140 --> 03:52:01,580
She's gone.

7763
03:52:01,900 --> 03:52:03,240
I'm going to the next floor.

7764
03:52:03,880 --> 03:52:04,980
You're going to the next...

7765
03:52:05,720 --> 03:52:06,820
Are you actually?

7766
03:52:08,540 --> 03:52:10,560
There's like a giant hand print.

7767
03:52:10,900 --> 03:52:11,680
What are these?

7768
03:52:12,380 --> 03:52:12,780
Giant...

7769
03:52:12,780 --> 03:52:14,780
Is that you?

7770
03:52:14,940 --> 03:52:15,260
That's me.

7771
03:52:16,320 --> 03:52:17,140
That's the anomaly.

7772
03:52:18,760 --> 03:52:19,920
How did you do that?

7773
03:52:20,880 --> 03:52:22,220
Wait, how did you do that?

7774
03:52:22,320 --> 03:52:23,140
You were over there.

7775
03:52:23,200 --> 03:52:23,680
Wait, they're both orange.

7776
03:52:24,280 --> 03:52:25,420
They're both orange light.

7777
03:52:25,520 --> 03:52:26,360
Which is the OG.

7778
03:52:26,740 --> 03:52:27,360
No, they're not.

7779
03:52:27,420 --> 03:52:28,800
That one's only one that's orange.

7780
03:52:29,040 --> 03:52:29,920
That one's orange for me.

7781
03:52:30,680 --> 03:52:31,540
They're both orange.

7782
03:52:31,640 --> 03:52:32,020
I think you fucked up.

7783
03:52:32,040 --> 03:52:33,240
I think I fucked up the light.

7784
03:52:33,320 --> 03:52:33,480
Yeah.

7785
03:52:34,080 --> 03:52:35,200
I think you messed it up.

7786
03:52:35,240 --> 03:52:37,360
Everything is like light now.

7787
03:52:37,540 --> 03:52:38,160
It's so bright.

7788
03:52:38,500 --> 03:52:40,320
This has to be the hard mode, right?

7789
03:52:40,420 --> 03:52:41,260
So let's go to the menu.

7790
03:52:41,600 --> 03:52:43,180
I'm going to go to the menu and see if it's on the menu.

7791
03:52:43,240 --> 03:52:44,580
It has to be the hard mode.

7792
03:52:45,280 --> 03:52:47,100
But like, what's the hard mode though?

7793
03:52:48,820 --> 03:52:49,260
Let's see.

7794
03:52:49,340 --> 03:52:49,860
New game.

7795
03:52:49,980 --> 03:52:50,800
Oh yeah, it's Hell.

7796
03:52:51,280 --> 03:52:53,660
Return to floor 000 if you fail.

7797
03:52:55,140 --> 03:52:56,240
Oh, it's the same.

7798
03:52:56,300 --> 03:52:57,960
It's just that you go back to zero.

7799
03:52:58,040 --> 03:52:59,000
Okay, so we finished.

7800
03:52:59,100 --> 03:52:59,760
We beat the game.

7801
03:53:00,780 --> 03:53:01,880
Wait, is this actually?

7802
03:53:01,880 --> 03:53:03,280
But is it...

7803
03:53:03,280 --> 03:53:12,440
It basically like instead of returning back to like, uh, like, you know, instead of returning back to like, floor 100, floor 200, floor 300, it goes back to zero.

7804
03:53:12,760 --> 03:53:15,520
Yeah, but is it also different floors?

7805
03:53:15,560 --> 03:53:16,240
I don't think so.

7806
03:53:16,480 --> 03:53:17,780
I'm starting a new game.

7807
03:53:18,080 --> 03:53:18,900
Are you fucking...

7808
03:53:20,200 --> 03:53:21,000
I'm curious.

7809
03:53:25,300 --> 03:53:26,540
Go some balls.

7810
03:53:28,180 --> 03:53:30,100
Well, you have to host the game.

7811
03:53:30,280 --> 03:53:31,140
You have to host it.

7812
03:53:31,300 --> 03:53:31,360
Oh, it's...

7813
03:53:31,880 --> 03:53:32,480
No, it's bloody.

7814
03:53:32,580 --> 03:53:32,880
It's bloody.

7815
03:53:33,000 --> 03:53:33,240
It's bloody.

7816
03:53:33,920 --> 03:53:36,420
So yeah, the hard mode is the bloody mode.

7817
03:53:36,700 --> 03:53:38,180
Yeah, I would assume it is.

7818
03:53:39,340 --> 03:53:40,300
We did it!

7819
03:53:40,360 --> 03:53:41,040
We did it!

7820
03:53:41,140 --> 03:53:42,120
We beat the game!

7821
03:53:43,060 --> 03:53:45,620
It only took us four hours.

7822
03:53:47,760 --> 03:53:49,180
What's the speedrun of this?

7823
03:53:49,520 --> 03:53:55,420
speedrun.com hospital It took us less than four hours.

7824
03:53:55,560 --> 03:53:58,060
You're right, because we had one hour of set up times.

7825
03:53:58,140 --> 03:54:00,060
Yeah, one hour to set up times.

7826
03:54:00,060 --> 03:54:03,120
And also, it's not been four hours yet.

7827
03:54:03,180 --> 03:54:04,240
It's been... not yet.

7828
03:54:04,900 --> 03:54:06,900
It's been one week since we...

7829
03:54:06,900 --> 03:54:07,100
Wait!

7830
03:54:07,240 --> 03:54:08,080
Oh my god!

7831
03:54:08,200 --> 03:54:09,300
We can be in the...

7832
03:54:09,300 --> 03:54:10,120
We can get in!

7833
03:54:10,480 --> 03:54:11,120
There's only...

7834
03:54:11,120 --> 03:54:13,540
We should submit our runs to speedrun.com.

7835
03:54:13,600 --> 03:54:14,700
There's only two participants.

7836
03:54:15,280 --> 03:54:15,680
Yo!

7837
03:54:15,800 --> 03:54:17,120
We're gonna be at the leaderboards!

7838
03:54:17,340 --> 03:54:18,380
We're at the leaderboards!

7839
03:54:20,100 --> 03:54:21,760
First place is the creator.

7840
03:54:22,820 --> 03:54:23,540
Stop it.

7841
03:54:23,600 --> 03:54:24,860
I think that's cheating.

7842
03:54:25,220 --> 03:54:26,720
That is actual cheating.

7843
03:54:29,220 --> 03:54:32,120
I like how First place is the creator.

7844
03:54:32,720 --> 03:54:34,020
What's his time?

7845
03:54:34,120 --> 03:54:35,100
30 minutes?

7846
03:54:35,300 --> 03:54:36,060
34 minutes?

7847
03:54:36,780 --> 03:54:37,900
That's not fair!

7848
03:54:38,940 --> 03:54:39,480
Not even fair.

7849
03:54:39,540 --> 03:54:40,380
It's not the creator!

7850
03:54:40,760 --> 03:54:41,720
It's some other guy!

7851
03:54:42,080 --> 03:54:42,700
I messed up.

7852
03:54:42,760 --> 03:54:43,400
It's not the creator.

7853
03:54:43,640 --> 03:54:46,000
I thought it was the creator because I saw Hong Kong.

7854
03:54:46,340 --> 03:54:48,780
Because I know that Dev is from Hong Kong.

7855
03:54:49,800 --> 03:54:51,520
Maybe it's a friend.

7856
03:54:51,700 --> 03:54:53,000
He fed the answers.

7857
03:54:53,500 --> 03:54:54,040
You're right!

7858
03:54:54,240 --> 03:54:55,380
It was one month ago.

7859
03:54:55,380 --> 03:54:56,900
We could be the third and fourth place.

7860
03:54:56,900 --> 03:54:59,000
If I submit first, I get third place.

7861
03:54:59,280 --> 03:55:00,940
Oh my god, Dokie.

7862
03:55:01,020 --> 03:55:05,920
The creator of that background just followed me on Twitter.

7863
03:55:06,240 --> 03:55:07,460
Wait, we're on the laundry mat?

7864
03:55:10,040 --> 03:55:10,780
Laundry mat?

7865
03:55:14,430 --> 03:55:15,710
Oh my god.

7866
03:55:15,930 --> 03:55:17,510
I'm gonna like the laundry mat.

7867
03:55:17,570 --> 03:55:19,190
Go get the laundry mat!

7868
03:55:19,810 --> 03:55:21,070
In fact, I'll follow the mat.

7869
03:55:21,070 --> 03:55:22,910
You have to use the laundry mat now.

7870
03:55:23,230 --> 03:55:23,990
You have to.

7871
03:55:26,630 --> 03:55:28,090
When will we get...

7872
03:55:28,090 --> 03:55:28,730
How did they know?

7873
03:55:28,850 --> 03:55:29,590
How did they know?

7874
03:55:29,610 --> 03:55:35,390
When will we get meaning that ghost girl at the laundry mat roleplay?

7875
03:55:36,030 --> 03:55:36,730
ASMR.

7876
03:55:37,870 --> 03:55:39,910
I will get the laundry mat.

7877
03:55:39,990 --> 03:55:41,670
I'll get the laundry mat background, everybody.

7878
03:55:41,950 --> 03:55:45,130
When will we get Laundromat ASMR RP?

7879
03:55:47,400 --> 03:55:48,170
I'm a maid.

7880
03:55:48,290 --> 03:55:49,870
I belong in the laundry room.

7881
03:55:52,250 --> 03:55:53,650
Oh god.

7882
03:55:54,810 --> 03:55:55,730
I'm tired.

7883
03:55:57,210 --> 03:55:58,970
This was fun.

7884
03:55:59,610 --> 03:56:00,590
This was fun.

7885
03:56:00,870 --> 03:56:02,490
And it was a team effort.

7886
03:56:02,690 --> 03:56:06,590
With the wisps and the dragoons working together.

7887
03:56:06,830 --> 03:56:08,030
The wisp goons.

7888
03:56:08,490 --> 03:56:09,670
Team effort.

7889
03:56:10,130 --> 03:56:13,190
We all did this together, guys.

7890
03:56:13,290 --> 03:56:14,170
Good job, everybody.

7891
03:56:14,430 --> 03:56:15,010
Good job, team.

7892
03:56:15,170 --> 03:56:17,550
Especially the dragoons.

7893
03:56:17,810 --> 03:56:20,730
The wisps helped like crazy, crazy.

7894
03:56:20,890 --> 03:56:21,330
Yeah.

7895
03:56:21,670 --> 03:56:27,590
Even though Mint didn't believe you sometimes, dragoons, like the hole in the bed.

7896
03:56:27,790 --> 03:56:28,270
Laugh.

7897
03:56:29,610 --> 03:56:29,830
Oh yeah.

7898
03:56:30,350 --> 03:56:34,190
But I know Doki kind of doubts you guys all the time.

7899
03:56:34,290 --> 03:56:34,670
But it's okay.

7900
03:56:34,850 --> 03:56:36,850
I always believed.

7901
03:56:37,890 --> 03:56:39,030
Did you agree?

7902
03:56:39,890 --> 03:56:40,450
Laugh.

7903
03:56:41,410 --> 03:56:41,970
Laugh.

7904
03:56:43,310 --> 03:56:44,590
Good job, everybody.

7905
03:56:44,830 --> 03:56:45,570
Good job, guys.

7906
03:56:45,690 --> 03:56:46,710
Good job, every wisps.

7907
03:56:46,710 --> 03:56:48,770
Good job, every dragoons.

7908
03:56:48,830 --> 03:56:50,050
You guys did it.

7909
03:56:50,210 --> 03:56:51,430
Remember the time stamp.

7910
03:56:51,610 --> 03:56:53,690
Whoever gets the most correct, guys.

7911
03:56:54,990 --> 03:56:55,390
Okay.

7912
03:56:55,450 --> 03:56:57,310
Whoever gets the most correct, then what is it?

7913
03:56:57,370 --> 03:56:58,070
What do we get?

7914
03:56:58,430 --> 03:56:59,310
What do we have to do?

7915
03:57:00,530 --> 03:57:01,790
We have to...

7916
03:57:02,930 --> 03:57:03,830
What's the punishment?

7917
03:57:05,290 --> 03:57:06,230
I don't know.

7918
03:57:06,410 --> 03:57:08,390
Okay, we decide the punishment later.

7919
03:57:09,250 --> 03:57:10,670
Oh, you decide?

7920
03:57:10,750 --> 03:57:11,510
You want to decide?

7921
03:57:11,810 --> 03:57:13,170
Only if you know.

7922
03:57:15,050 --> 03:57:16,030
Are you not confident?

7923
03:57:16,170 --> 03:57:17,430
Are you not confident that you're going to win?

7924
03:57:17,690 --> 03:57:18,890
No, I'm pretty confident.

7925
03:57:18,890 --> 03:57:19,670
I'm pretty confident.

7926
03:57:19,830 --> 03:57:20,610
You're pretty confident?

7927
03:57:21,010 --> 03:57:22,630
Then you decide something right now.

7928
03:57:22,750 --> 03:57:26,150
You're the one who was like, we'll decide later.

7929
03:57:26,730 --> 03:57:28,350
Yeah, because we don't know.

7930
03:57:28,570 --> 03:57:29,330
We don't know the result.

7931
03:57:30,350 --> 03:57:31,450
You're so confident.

7932
03:57:33,650 --> 03:57:36,710
Loser has to use the other person's gamer subs code.

7933
03:57:37,150 --> 03:57:38,330
Loser has to use the other person's gamer subs code.

7934
03:57:38,550 --> 03:57:39,490
Okay, deal.

7935
03:57:39,650 --> 03:57:40,110
Deal.

7936
03:57:43,150 --> 03:57:44,590
Let me grab...

7937
03:57:44,590 --> 03:57:46,170
Let me buy the free pack.

7938
03:57:46,690 --> 03:57:47,210
Laugh.

7939
03:57:49,050 --> 03:57:51,270
The free sample pack.

7940
03:57:54,910 --> 03:57:55,870
Oh, no.

7941
03:57:58,230 --> 03:57:59,650
Oh, GG's guys.

7942
03:58:00,110 --> 03:58:00,830
GG's everybody.

7943
03:58:00,930 --> 03:58:02,590
Are you going to chat with your wisp?

7944
03:58:02,650 --> 03:58:03,810
Because I'm just going to head off.

7945
03:58:03,990 --> 03:58:05,110
We did a long stream.

7946
03:58:05,110 --> 03:58:07,230
I'll chat just a little bit, but not very much.

7947
03:58:08,630 --> 03:58:09,230
GG's man.

7948
03:58:10,250 --> 03:58:10,730
GG's.

7949
03:58:12,510 --> 03:58:13,310
Bye bye.

7950
03:58:14,370 --> 03:58:15,130
Bye bye.

7951
03:58:15,290 --> 03:58:16,050
We did it.

7952
03:58:16,250 --> 03:58:16,910
We survived.

7953
03:58:20,840 --> 03:58:21,320
Alright.

7954
03:58:21,520 --> 03:58:22,800
I'm really tired now.

7955
03:58:22,980 --> 03:58:25,400
I didn't think we would play for hours.

7956
03:58:25,560 --> 03:58:26,160
But that was so fun.

7957
03:58:26,700 --> 03:58:28,540
That was really, really, really fun.

7958
03:58:28,700 --> 03:58:31,540
I hope you guys enjoyed it a lot.

7959
03:58:31,740 --> 03:58:33,820
I am going to head out now.

7960
03:58:34,060 --> 03:58:35,720
Because I'm really tired.

7961
03:58:35,860 --> 03:58:37,560
And actually have a lot of stuff to do.

7962
03:58:37,780 --> 03:58:41,540
I'm doing last minute, last minute skin suit stuff.

7963
03:58:41,760 --> 03:58:44,540
So I hope you guys had a great time everybody.

7964
03:58:46,020 --> 03:58:47,560
That was a very fun game.

7965
03:58:47,900 --> 03:58:49,180
And I just want to say as always everybody.

7966
03:58:49,360 --> 03:58:50,060
Stay hydrated.

7967
03:58:50,260 --> 03:58:50,620
Pause the video.

7968
03:58:50,620 --> 03:58:50,920
Watch the check.

7969
03:58:50,920 --> 03:58:52,480
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

7970
03:58:52,620 --> 03:58:55,080
And if you except for me, head to Ben.

7971
03:58:55,220 --> 03:58:56,420
Because you deserve it.

7972
03:58:56,520 --> 03:58:57,500
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

7973
03:58:58,180 --> 03:58:58,840
Bye guys.

7974
03:58:59,580 --> 03:58:59,940
Bye.
