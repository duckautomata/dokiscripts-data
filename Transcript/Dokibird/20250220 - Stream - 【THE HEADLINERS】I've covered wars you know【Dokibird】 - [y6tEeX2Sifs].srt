1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:02,420
Whoa, okay.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,600
Let me fix the volume.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,180
Hello, testing, testing.

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,560
All right, guys.

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,820
Oh, wait, there's more audio options.

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:14,920
There's more audio options now.

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:15,720
Oh, wait, there are now?

8
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:16,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

9
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,180
Holy shit.

10
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:18,780
Oh, nice.

11
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:19,680
Okay.

12
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,420
Why wasn't that on the menu?

13
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,380
That's so crazy.

14
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,120
The menu was like three options, like two options.

15
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,080
The menu was like, do you want audio?

16
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:27,860
Yes, no.

17
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:28,660
Do you want audio?

18
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,280
And also, do you want to mute the main menu music?

19
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,200
Like... You could still do that.

20
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,640
The main menu music was really loud.

21
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:36,300
Yeah.

22
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:37,880
You could still mute the main menu music.

23
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,200
By the way, for those who don't know, Naima and I are both very sick.

24
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,620
But that doesn't stop us from getting the news.

25
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:48,960
I'm going away from the sickies.

26
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,460
The news doesn't sleep.

27
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,780
The world doesn't sleep for us.

28
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,220
We're going to get photos of Spider-Man.

29
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:00,760
Wait,

30
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:05,880
I can edit?

31
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,480
Oh, shit.

32
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,300
I was going to say let's edit because I can't tell who's...

33
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,180
Oh, no, I can be... I know exactly who I want to be.

34
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,100
We just immediately both went for it.

35
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:22,820
I know who I... Ladies, ladies, who will get me photos of Spider-Man?

36
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,780
You look like a cop.

37
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,240
No, I look like a cop.

38
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:36,200
You look like a fucking... Like, those like undercover cops, but they were definitely not undercover.

39
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,740
This one actually looks like, you know, when people are like, look, it's Vi, but with Jinx's hair color.

40
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,700
Oh, yeah.

41
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,740
Where is Snuffy?

42
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,620
Is it like laggy?

43
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,760
Not laggy, but like... It's just unresponsive, which I kind of expected.

44
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,200
Oh, are we conspiracy theorists?

45
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,240
Oh, are we?

46
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,020
Wait, what is this?

47
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,020
I mean...

48
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,740
We're gonna figure out who shot JFK.

49
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,160
Oh, I can hear a vague echo.

50
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,020
That looks like JFK right there.

51
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:10,980
Do I?

52
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,320
I don't think so.

53
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,040
We're gonna figure out... Oh, I do hear it.

54
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:14,520
What?

55
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,880
Doki, you're echoing.

56
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:16,940
Oh, am I echoing?

57
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,240
Okay, let me fix this.

58
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,260
You're just mildly...

59
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,040
I think I know why.

60
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,560
Okay, it should be better now.

61
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,460
Is it good now?

62
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,500
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

63
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,500
Yeah, that's better.

64
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,180
Thank you.

65
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,780
Oh my god, hey, what's up?

66
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,160
Wait, is that... Oh my god, there's planes and everything.

67
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,960
All right, we need... Okay, wait, let me check this.

68
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,420
I like the YouTube red circle.

69
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,300
Plane.

70
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,340
Do you see it?

71
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,700
Did you see it?

72
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:45,300
Okay, guys, if we... It looks like I'm lagging in and out because I'm tabbing out and in because I'm trying to find Snuffy.

73
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,600
Snuffy has yet to un-private her stream.

74
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,100
I will... Wait, no, I do... No, she's invisible, right?

75
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,960
I don't even see her.

76
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,480
Oh, so if you, like, run, it does that.

77
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,180
Oh, she's called Snum.

78
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,260
Oh, she's called Snum?

79
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,600
I'll invite her.

80
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,680
I was like, where is she?

81
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,480
Yeah, I don't know.

82
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:17,560
I typed Snu, and I was like, oh, there she is, and then, like, compulsively hit the F key, and then she went, and I was like, what?

83
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,940
Oh, yeah, no, she's invisible.

84
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,680
I invited her anyway, maybe I'll let her come in.

85
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,080
All right, we'll see.

86
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,640
All right, let me get some cough drops.

87
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,620
It was advised that I should only take one per day.

88
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:34,040
Did you really name this the Sloppy Sister Session?

89
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:34,780
Yeah, I did.

90
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,740
Sloppy Station?

91
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,340
We are reporters.

92
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,140
All right, let's see.

93
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,520
I'll just up everybody.

94
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,500
My audio guy was like, does this game have individual volume sliders for people?

95
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,040
No.

96
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,540
Snuffy says the game blue screened her.

97
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,780
Oh, that's a good start to the day.

98
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,820
Hey, guys, join the Discord here.

99
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,160
Say we sent you.

100
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:02,700
Tell them.

101
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,420
And tell them to sponsor us.

102
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,500
Hey, you blue screened our friend.

103
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,900
Okay, but maybe not.

104
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,320
I think that's, like, a hate rate.

105
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,160
I think that's, like, actually sending a... Oh, I thought you were just telling us, not your chat.

106
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,180
Yeah, no, don't do that.

107
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:14,780
Don't do that.

108
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,020
Okay, if you do that, say that Lime who sent you.

109
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:18,700
No, I don't know.

110
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,520
Junior abuses her power.

111
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,800
Zero involvement in this.

112
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:29,580
Wait, there's a store here.

113
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,940
Oh, shit, I can get score shoes.

114
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,900
We need a pro camera trap.

115
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:34,340
I want score shoes.

116
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:37,620
God, why is there always a flashlight and a pro flashlight?

117
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,860
It means the flashlight standard is going to be $40.

118
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:40,940
Sorry, guys.

119
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,520
I am in a lot of debt for my...

120
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,380
I'm in a lot of debt.

121
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:53,440
Is this just a higher budget version of that free game that came out after Lethal Company where you went down into this creepy place and recorded things and then watched it back afterwards?

122
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,000
Content warning.

123
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,040
Content warning, yeah.

124
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

125
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,260
That's what I thought, too.

126
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,400
It looked really, like, it looked a lot like content warning.

127
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:00,960
It reminds me of that.

128
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,340
I didn't play that.

129
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,080
Darwin Awards.

130
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,460
Miss Darwin.

131
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,700
Returns to flirt with death for a laugh.

132
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,620
I think that's cool.

133
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,140
Yeah, I'm ready to flirt.

134
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:13,360
Anything.

135
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,680
Oh my god, what the fuck is that?

136
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,400
Those are some of the monsters.

137
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:23,940
Oh, I think that's why it's weird is the run is not hold shift.

138
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:24,920
It's like tap.

139
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,040
Is it?

140
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,380
Your run looks really stupid.

141
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:27,840
Oh, yeah.

142
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,260
Look at the run.

143
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,860
So, okay.

144
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:31,500
You.

145
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:34,980
I think.

146
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,580
Wait, what are the other controls?

147
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,300
Oh, there's crouch.

148
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,920
Oh, the crouch is so laggy.

149
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,740
I think, yeah, it's really laggy.

150
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:46,160
Yeah.

151
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:47,740
I think it's not.

152
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,820
I think it's toggled, not like.

153
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:50,860
Yeah, it is.

154
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:51,300
It's toggle.

155
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,600
Yeah.

156
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,560
Oh, look at it go.

157
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,600
Oh, the press.

158
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,360
I don't.

159
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:58,960
Oh, wait, wait.

160
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,580
These are equipment.

161
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,120
We only have 10 pictures.

162
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,200
How do you use it?

163
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,580
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

164
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,260
Get over here.

165
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:08,720
Okay.

166
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,560
Get over here.

167
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,320
Oh, no, no, no.

168
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,080
Oh, next to me.

169
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,380
Next to me.

170
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:11,740
Next to me.

171
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,460
I'm here.

172
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:12,900
I'm here.

173
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:13,460
Next to me.

174
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:13,880
Next to me.

175
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:14,780
Oh, next to you.

176
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,020
Oh.

177
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,900
Oh, what's that look like?

178
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,620
It's beautiful.

179
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,020
Oh, you can't.

180
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,460
Hello, everybody.

181
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,240
Microplayer here.

182
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,380
Oh, wow.

183
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,880

191
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:51,530
Oh, what?

192
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,910
The game like killed her.

193
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,170
So I'm giving my text.

194
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,650

All right, guys, here's some pro tips when taking photos.

196
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:06,950
Oh, the high, the higher the angle, the more flattering you look, guys, right here.

00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:12,310
Don't take pictures like this.

200
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:13,970
Take pictures like this.

201
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,230
Oh, look at that.

202
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,190

00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,570
Hey, guys, welcome back to my channel.

00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,350
There's no flash.

206
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,230
I just have a flashlight.

207
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:29,550
My name is Petey Peter Peterson.

00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,050
This is a private session.

00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,230
I thought this was a collab.

210
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,770
Uh, this is a lab party.

211
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:41,550
What do you mean?

212
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,770
Oh, collab with other YouTubers.

00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:44,470

214
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:45,030

You're flying solo.

00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:48,290
Yeah.

218
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,630
And today we're going to do a crazy challenge.

219
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:57,390
See if I can get a monster to do 20 squats or every squat it does.

220
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,370
I'll lose ten thousand dollars.

221
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:00,290

Go jump around while you're in selfie mode.

228
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,490
How am I holding the camera?

229
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:27,830
I'm just.

230
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:28,390
Hello, everybody.

231
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:34,430
My name is Doki Bird and today we're gonna go see some monsters today.

232
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:38,090
Oh, I see one right in front of me.

233
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:39,370
Whoa, me too.

234
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:40,170
Oh, my God.

235
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:40,890
Say cheese.

236
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:45,330
Oh, there she is.

237
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:48,310
Today, right here is what we call.

238
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:53,090
Oh, she's outside her natural habitat right now.

239
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:58,430
Well said, I got this then immediately regrets it.

240
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:03,790
These are the last known photos of our journalist bathtub people.

241
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,790
Oh, my God, it is.

242
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,710
Oh, my God.

243
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:08,670
I love this one.

244
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:11,470
Look at the monster.

245
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,010
Oh, my God.

246
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:15,010
Oh, wow.

247
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,290
Johnny boy.

248
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:17,150
Oh, my God.

249
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:17,990
Johnny boy.

250
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,750
Got some at the end.

251
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:24,550
Yeah, that could be the last photo before she before she died.

252
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,670
How did he die here?

253
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,750
How did Captain Peter die?

254
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:32,830
I don't think he died.

255
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:36,050
No, these are all like last photos before they died, though.

256
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:39,570
Oh, I like this guy's photo here.

257
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:40,610
This one's good.

258
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:45,610
He looks so like, I'm afraid he's ready.

259
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:49,510
He's facing death and he's facing it head on with his back.

260
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,450
I think this one is funny, too.

261
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:55,150
This one like, you know, someone else took that photo right here.

262
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,450
He's like, he's not behind us, right?

263
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:03,850
Wait, what?

264
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:04,190
Wow.

265
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,670
Is this like a spoiler of things?

266
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,350
Oh, my gosh, there's a giant lady.

267
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:08,270
Wait, proceed.

268
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:11,990
What?

269
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:12,570
What am I doing?

270
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:13,930
Get in the camera.

271
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:14,670
Get in the camera.

272
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,860
Yeah, buddy.

273
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,420
Yeah, let's go.

274
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,120
Press seven.

275
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:27,760
Press seven.

276
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:28,860
Seven?

277
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:30,540
Let's go.

278
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:34,980
Oh, yeah.

279
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,340
Wait, what's this one?

280
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,280
Oh, it's like, oh, what number was that?

281
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,120
What number did you press?

282
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,140
Six.

283
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,160
Hey there, buddy.

284
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,180
Wait, wait, do it the lime.

285
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:49,820
Do it the lime.

286
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:55,520
No, no, no, your other hand is going up.

287
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,240
What's the other one?

288
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:56,900
Oh, this one?

289
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,600
I think it's this one.

290
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,080
Oh, no, the wrong way.

291
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,000
You got to be on the other side.

292
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:01,440
Okay.

293
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,500
Like that?

294
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:02,980
Nope.

295
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:05,880
I don't know what I'm doing.

296
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,620
He's a perpetual hover hander.

297
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,740
I'm really scared.

298
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,160
Oh, my God.

299
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,280
I'm so close to another woman.

300
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,700
You get points for, like, doing emotes in the picture.

301
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,140
Oh, yeah.

302
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,480
What's number five for me?

303
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,060
It's like pointing, I think.

304
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:29,320
You.

305
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,220
Yeah, it's pointing.

306
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,140
Okay, download it to desktop folder.

307
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:34,500
Cool.

308
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,940
She's downloading the photos from the game.

309
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,060
Yeah.

310
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,240
Hello.

311
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,080
What am I doing?

312
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,560
Oh, wait, what am I doing?

313
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,140
Oh, wait.

314
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,240
Like this, like this.

315
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:47,700
Yeah.

316
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,620
We need a chair.

317
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,100
We need a chair for this.

318
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,540
You're, like, opposite of it.

319
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,820
You're looking at the chair.

320
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,800
You're not sitting in the chair.

321
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,040
Oh, it's like sitting backwards in a chair.

322
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,480
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

323
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:10,340
Oh, yeah, that's what I'm trying to do.

324
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,800
It doesn't actually work like that.

325
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:15,140
What's number two?

326
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,640
You're jiving.

327
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,160
It looks like we're doing the twist.

328
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,700
Yeah, let's do the twist.

329
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,120
Hello, I'm Paul.

330
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,800
Is that your name?

331
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,320
Hi, I'm Paul.

332
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:35,820
Hey, Paul.

333
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:36,560
Hey, everybody.

334
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,400
Oh, man.

335
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,080
Shrink resolution real quick and shit.

336
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,700
Oh, is that game still crashing her?

337
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:53,160
Uh, she's, like, trying to kill the resolution and stuff on it right now.

338
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,200
I'm going to go and investigate and see how it's going for her if she's live.

339
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,040
Okay.

340
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:58,920
Okay.

341
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,500
She'll be live if she blue screen.

342
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,360
Yeah, I was gonna say that too.

343
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,440
Oh, okay.

344
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:03,820
Okay.

345
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,960
I like how we already used her camera's battery and we're not even out of the lobby yet.

346
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,540
Oh my god, that's a giant woman.

347
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:12,780
Should we put it back?

348
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,400
Giant woman.

349
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,240
I know.

350
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,980
I'm excited for that one.

351
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,620
Yeah, I hope she steps on us.

352
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:20,900
Get that.

353
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,660
Then we're gonna explore the things we're gonna see.

354
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,900
We're gonna race to two dice to her first.

355
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,420
We could go right now.

356
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,340
Nah, we'll wait.

357
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:33,480
We'll go.

358
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,920
Yeah, we gotta wait for Snuffy.

359
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,180
Snap great pictures then get the F out.

360
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,740
Green doors equals get in.

361
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,120
They put too many stars.

362
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,840
Get the F-U-C-K.

363
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:47,820
No, F-U-C-K.

364
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:49,720
Oh, wait.

365
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,240
Oh, wait.

366
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,580
Oh, it's the freak out.

367
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,040
Get the freak out.

368
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:56,480
Oh, no.

369
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:57,480
Oh my gosh.

370
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,600
Does your thing start like lagging when you start running?

371
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,300
Like it starts going like... No, it's fine for me.

372
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,860
I think I might have the tankier PC.

373
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,200
Said the person who needed to get replaced.

374
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,420
Yeah, but now it's okay.

375
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,180
It crashed like two days ago, but now it's okay.

376
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:19,220
Okay.

377
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,320
Oh, we have no money.

378
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,920
We can get a trap.

379
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,160
We can get a big backpack.

380
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,960
Why are we gonna do a helmet?

381
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,420
Are they like, what are you gonna throw rocks at me?

382
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,560
Like rocks at us?

383
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,560
They could.

384
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,580
I mean, it doesn't look too dangerous.

385
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,080
No, it's so clean.

386
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:42,460
Yeah.

387
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:46,940
Is that like it's like a there's like shooting stars.

388
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:47,940
Yeah.

389
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:54,540
I don't think they're not bullets, right?

390
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,820
No, right?

391
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,920
No, that's not gunfire.

392
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,240
I mean, you're an ambulance.

393
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:09,420
I mean, to be fair, there is no one walking outside, but it's like, you know, after curfew.

394
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:16,980
Ever since the government instated a nationwide curfew, you know, this is how it's gonna look like now.

395
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,160
I think it's a nice warm ambiance.

396
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,080
I like it.

397
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,360
It's kind of smoggy.

398
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,220
Yeah, it's just New York City.

399
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:32,320
Yeah, regular New York City night.

400
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:38,120
Wasn't like New York City like red at one point because of like the fires?

401
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,480
Yeah, actually.

402
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:41,840
Yeah, see?

403
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,200
That's actually what I was thinking of.

404
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,820
Oh no, we threw away the newspaper.

405
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,320
We're failures at journalism.

406
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,900
Nobody wants to read our paper.

407
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,940
No, it's because we're starting our career now.

408
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,780
We're gonna make it big.

409
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,800
We're gonna get the front page news, guys.

410
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:05,720
I'm in a lot of debt because I decided to go into journalism in 2025.

411
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,580
Oh, why does my thing do that when I run?

412
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,600
Why does it do that?

413
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,660
Nothing is still having problems.

414
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,100
I'm trying to help fix it.

415
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,160
What's going on?

416
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:21,100
It might be, you know, the whole thing where Intel CPUs or we're like getting really unstable.

417
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,560
It might be something like that.

418
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:22,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

419
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:23,740
I'm not sure.

420
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:27,020
I'm like, I'm like, yeah, I'm kind of like scanning her chat.

421
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,900
And it's like, oh, oh, no.

422
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,620
Oh, no.

423
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,860
I think it might be like degraded CPU thingy.

424
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:36,740
Oh, she might need to turn it like underclock her PC then.

425
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,360
To play headliners?

426
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,260
That's crazy.

427
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,840
Yeah, headliners too powerful.

428
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,500
Oh, no.

429
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:49,000
The only time I've ever had to underclock my PC was for Marvel Rivals.

430
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,360
That's crazy.

431
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,480
Marvel Rivals runs so weird.

432
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,860
Like, no matter what I change, it runs at basically the same frame rate.

433
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:02,020
Yeah, it's just incredibly tanky in general.

434
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,400
Yeah.

435
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,900
Is there batteries?

436
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,780
Oh, there's batteries for flashlight, by the way.

437
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,580
Oh, I put my phone away.

438
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:17,520
I was like, wait, I wonder if I could take your phone.

439
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,080
I mean, your camera.

440
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,680
Oh, I can.

441
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:25,180
If I can take your camera, I can take your like, I can see your photos.

442
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,000
Wait, do you see it?

443
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:27,820
Yeah, yeah.

444
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:43,490
Head bobbing.

445
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,230
Maybe it's that.

446
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,390
Okay, let me try it.

447
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,430
Oh, there's head bobbing?

448
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:51,950
Apparently, I think maybe that's what's...

449
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:53,070
Sorry.

450
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:54,210
Bless you.

451
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:54,930
No, there isn't.

452
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:56,490
Where's the head bobbing part?

453
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:57,590
I don't see it.

454
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:58,710
I don't know.

455
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,130
That's what somebody told me.

456
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:01,750
There's no head bobbing.

457
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:02,770
Liar.

458
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:03,610
I got one guide.

459
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:05,850
I got one guide.

460
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,270
You got one guide.

461
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,590
Yeah, maybe.

462
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,590
Glitch or network lag.

463
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:13,950
That might be it, I think.

464
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:15,950
Everything else is running fine.

465
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:23,590
Maybe I should have hosted because I'm the most central.

466
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:25,290
Yeah, you can host everyone.

467
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,150
That's not why am I hosting?

468
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,690
I'm west coast.

469
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:34,750
Yeah, we only have time to switch it up while stuffy tries to figure this out.

470
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,030
Yeah, yeah, you host it.

471
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:36,430
Get out.

472
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:38,110
Get out of my room right now.

473
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,470
Okay, I'm kicking you out.

474
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:40,550
Get out.

475
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:41,250
Bye, everybody.

476
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:42,950
Thanks for the stream.

477
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:43,530
This was a lot of fun.

478
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:44,390
All right, bye, everyone.

479
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,490
That was so fun being in the lobby.

480
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:47,550
Bye, guys.

481
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,390
Bye, bye.

482
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:54,410
All right, time to wait for my invite.

483
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:58,150
We gotta wait for Mint to invite.

484
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,930
Oh my god, my voice.

485
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:03,670
It's not doing so well, guys.

486
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:06,510
The worst part is I have a sponsor tomorrow.

487
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:14,070
Yesterday, I was like, I'm all right.

488
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:17,050
But it should be fine.

489
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:18,790
Today, I am.

490
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,890
I'm sucking on a cough drop right now.

491
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:24,170
Today, I'm like, I woke up and I was like, what happened?

492
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:27,190
I'm drinking tea right now.

493
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,920
Yeah, I'm drinking tea at the moment.

494
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,120
The counteract, everything.

495
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,340
Literally, I woke up.

496
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:46,100
I couldn't even like get words out of my mouth.

497
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,780
So this is like a huge improvement right now.

498
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,740
Because before then, I couldn't even say a single word.

499
00:19:51,980 --> 00:20:04,120
And then I literally was like, I woke up, made tea, got Manuka honey, and then got the Chinese herbal medicine.

500
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,740
You guys know which one?

501
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,020
The black one.

502
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:15,800
And then I was just... And also, I did the Buckley's cough syrup because I needed something to soothe the throat.

503
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,400
So I was just like, okay, all of those.

504
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,000
And then I took a shower too with the steam.

505
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,600
So I literally was just like, every medication possible.

506
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,380
Right now.

507
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,680
I'm maxing everything.

508
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,560
So yeah, and then I also got tea as well.

509
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,360
So I joined the game.

510
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:40,960
I should be able to join.

511
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,880
Hello, I'm here.

512
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,360
Oh, hello.

513
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,020
Hello.

514
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,820
Oh, you have like three lives too.

515
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:53,860
What is?

516
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:55,880
I have three what?

517
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,100
You have three lives.

518
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,680
That's like the little passes, right?

519
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,200
Yeah, I think that's what the passes are.

520
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:01,520
Yeah.

521
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,300
Or press pass.

522
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,280
Oh my god.

523
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,400
Oh, this is already looking so much better.

524
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,360
Oh, it must have been the ping then.

525
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,540
I'm fine though.

526
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,820
On your server.

527
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:15,340
Okay.

528
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,880
I don't know what it was.

529
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,200
Maybe it was like, also with Limu connecting.

530
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:20,980
Maybe.

531
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,200
I don't know, actually.

532
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,460
Because like for me, because then she wouldn't cheat.

533
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,680
Apparently, VTube studio.

534
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:28,420
What the fuck?

535
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:29,840
Well, what happened?

536
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:30,620
Press.

537
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,200
I feel like the press badge is showing up.

538
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:33,820
Okay, they're gone.

539
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,640
I think those are lives.

540
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,520
Like it shows you how much lives you have.

541
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,160
So apparently it was VTube studio.

542
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,880
Oh, it was VTube studios.

543
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:58,060
I think it's like her CPU is dying so hard that having both running kind of broke everything.

544
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,340
Oh, so today was the day she found out her PC's dying.

545
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,000
I think they already did the thing where they under vaulted it.

546
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,140
It's just not anymore or something.

547
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:11,980
Um, no, if you under vaulted, if you under clock your PC too much, you start breaking your PC.

548
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:13,440
Yeah.

549
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:17,660
So like, I think she just needs to get a new PC at this point.

550
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,180
Because she, I mean, the 50, the 50x series comes out.

551
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,000
That means the PC's died.

552
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,200
Rest in peace.

553
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,080
You hear me saying, my, my, snuffy's PC died.

554
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:37,160
Tried to play headliners and she got a new PC.

555
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,100
And her CP, no, her PC died.

556
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,300
Tried to play headliners and her CPU fried.

557
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,080
Hell yeah.

558
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:49,740
Wait,

559
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,640
uh, Limo, do you want to change back to your old outfit?

560
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,000
Oh, right, right, right.

561
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:57,740
Hold on a second.

562
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:03,500
She'll be the token woman in the group.

563
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:04,800
Hell yeah.

564
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,060
Actually, oh, I'm going to be this guy.

565
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:08,620
You're bald.

566
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,300
That's it?

567
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,500
He's like, mm-hmm.

568
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,420
Yeah, so what?

569
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,880
I don't look like I belong in New York.

570
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,860
Like, I look like Seinfeld.

571
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:30,840
You look like, well, the one thing that's missing is that Seinfeld has a head of hair.

572
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:32,800
No, his friend.

573
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,160
Oh, the other guy.

574
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:34,680
George.

575
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,120
He doesn't have glasses.

576
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,560
I've never watched Seinfeld, by the way.

577
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,640
I don't know who George is.

578
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,680
I just know Seinfeld.

579
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,360
I've watched all of Seinfeld.

580
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,540
Damn, what a hag.

581
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:50,400
Like, two years ago.

582
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,180
Sure, sure, two years ago.

583
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:58,180
Is it because you watched the Seinfeld AI shit?

584
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,480
Is that why you watched Seinfeld?

585
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,840
No, I watched Seinfeld before the AI.

586
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,920
And then I watched the AI and was like, whoa, this is so accurate.

587
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:08,800
Nothing's happening.

588
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:16,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah, two years ago.

589
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,060
Yeah, yeah.

590
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,040
I guess that's what they say.

591
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,800
What's the deal with Snuffy's computer?

592
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,660
I think, I think we've gotten there.

593
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:35,880
She switched models to a less intensive one on and it might not be all right.

594
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,480
I feel so bad for her.

595
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:41,220
Yeah, it's so frustrating when your computer's not working the way it should.

596
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:45,200
Yeah, I can't believe- Death by Headliners, what a way to go.

597
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,600
Death by Kuso Games.

598
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,580
Of all the things that take you out, right?

599
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,980
Of all the things, it has to be a Kuso game.

600
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,180
Oh my god, you found a music player, holy shit.

601
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:54,700
That's right.

602
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,180
Wait, how do you dance again?

603
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:57,720
It's two.

604
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:06,160
I actually have this whole thing with Path of Exile 2, where that thing will, like, break my computer, and that sucks.

605
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,440
Nice dancing.

606
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,340
What is your mouth doing when you dance?

607
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,460
Holy shit, what's your mouth doing?

608
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,680
I keep dancing.

609
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,120
Okay, look at the photo, look at the photo.

610
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:21,920
I'm looking.

611
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,360
You look like you're creeping on her.

612
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:31,220
Look at him go, look at him go.

613
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:32,540
No!

614
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,200
Hold on, here you go.

615
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,820
Lime, lime, look at it.

616
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,520
Yeah, I do.

617
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:41,820
I do a gallery.

618
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,600
Oh man, freaky mirror.

619
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,220
There you go.

620
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,280
Man, what a freak.

621
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,720
That's what they call me at the club.

622
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,160
At the club, let's go.

623
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,540
Whoa, whose scarf is that?

624
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,040
Wait, I wonder if there's new photos.

625
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:12,780
I'm gonna check.

626
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,280
Oh yeah, see if they've changed.

627
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,720
No, it's the same ones.

628
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,300
Maybe it's just, like, a standard set then.

629
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:27,760
Yeah, maybe, or, like, yeah, maybe it's, like, submitted, like, uh, Twitter users submit it, and then they change it every so often.

630
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,700
Yeah, we gotta get on here.

631
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,780
We gotta get on here.

632
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,160
All right, we gotta get some good photos then.

633
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,840
Yeah, and if we post these, you guys gotta like it so that they know.

634
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,180
Yeah, yeah, so the devs will add us into the photos.

635
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:41,460
Yeah.

636
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:47,830
I wonder if you can change the channels.

637
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:50,850
Oh, there was a different one earlier.

638
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:54,630
Maybe...

639
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:55,250
Oh, see?

640
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:01,010
Stop laughing at me!

641
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:02,590
Girls just wanna have fun.

642
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:06,170
It's almost... It really is.

643
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:08,690
Walmart girls just wanna have fun.

644
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:12,970
Oh, there's stuff for Sophia's crush!

645
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:13,190
No!

646
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:19,710
In the middle of the night, my mayor of the town said, I'm fighting for my life.

647
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:24,770
I need someone to take a picture of the kaiju.

648
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:28,310
The press just wanna have fun.

649
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:31,610
All the press just wanna have fun.

650
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:40,890
Apparently, taking my invite to this session caused OBS to crash.

651
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:41,770
Wait, what?

652
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:44,430
Oh my god, what's wrong?

653
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:46,970
What's so fucking... What's wrong?

654
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,960
It's the whole thing that's so cursed for her.

655
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,860
This is so cursed.

656
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,080
Hey, oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

657
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:02,920
Which one is it?

658
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,260
Which one?

659
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,820
No, goddammit, which number was it?

660
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,280
It's one, it's one, it's one.

661
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:08,660
Oh, it's one?

662
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:09,020
Okay.

663
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:11,740
Is it working?

664
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:13,800
No.

665
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,000
Wait, hold on, let me see this.

666
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,040
Does it... Wait, which one is it?

667
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,740
Which one is the hover hand?

668
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,800
Oh, it's six, I think.

669
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,540
Yeah, yeah, six, six.

670
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

671
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,980
Does it look like I'm cool against the wall?

672
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,440
It does, actually.

673
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:31,100
I think that's what it's supposed to be rather than putting your arm around it.

674
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,520
Oh, Snob's here!

675
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,460
Wait, wait, wait, oh my god, welcome!

676
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:38,560
Snuffy!

677
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:39,220
Snuffy!

678
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:39,800
Hello?

679
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,920
Hi, you're here!

680
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:42,300
You're with us!

681
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,920
Oh my god, it's using the good... Okay, wait, hold on, I...

682
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,480
Look at this.

683
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:45,740
Hello.

684
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,380
We missed you.

685
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,000
Wait, what?

686
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,780
I feel... This is wrong.

687
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,760
What did you have to do to get it working?

688
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,680
What did you do?

689
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,300
Naked, I'm completely naked.

690
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,600
I'm like a flesh streamer.

691
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,100
I'm nothing, it's just a game.

692
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,460
I know you're not a model!

693
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,160
You don't have a skin suit on or anything!

694
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,580
Where's my beautiful face and like, quirky traits?

695
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,580
Just add a PNG.

696
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:12,800
You can like, put your own foogie on the reactive thing on the bottom so you can put yourself there.

697
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,420
You have a PNG to it.

698
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,960
I'm too afraid, anything else...

699
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,840
If you tab out, it'll probably break everything.

700
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,300
It's like Jenga, if I move one thing, it's gonna shatter.

701
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,160
You know what's gonna happen?

702
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:27,360
We're all gonna be like, super excited, it's gonna finally be working.

703
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,240
We go into the mission and you instantly crash.

704
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,840
I'm gonna do that.

705
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,000
No, you're gonna jinx it!

706
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,240
You're gonna jinx it!

707
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,540
Look at us dance!

708
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,240
We're so happy.

709
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:53,520
We figured out how to dance, and then we found a copy of Girls Just Wanna Have Fun at Home.

710
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,040
So we're having a really good time.

711
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:58,240
So there's emotes, you know, number keys are emotes, by the way.

712
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,200
Okay, okay, hold on.

713
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,820
Let me get my foogie up really quick.

714
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:05,460
Also, there's a girl with blue hair that you can be if you want, over here.

715
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,560
Oh, I thought you guys just made your characters.

716
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,880
No, no, no.

717
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,900
You can choose from the...

718
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,000
You think I would've made this?

719
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,120
Yes, 100%.

720
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:19,300
So that was my first pick, was that was instantly, you made that.

721
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,960
Oh, thank you!

722
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,280
Wait, wait, wait, lean against the wall so I can take that picture.

723
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,640
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

724
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,240
It should be the brick wall, the brick wall.

725
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,140
That's where the aesthetic is.

726
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,120
Check me out, check me out.

727
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,580
I'm like, wistfully looking out the window.

728
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,100
Tonight, we're gonna be catching some real monsters.

729
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,240
Don't talk, don't talk when you do it.

730
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,280
Look at it.

731
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,380
Look at your expression.

732
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,970
He's just a chill guy.

733
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:05,310
Just a chill guy.

734
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,070
The smile.

735
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:15,550
Look at this photo.

736
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:17,330
That took a minute.

737
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:19,290
It looks too...

738
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:21,010
It looks too chill.

739
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:22,290
Oh, I gotta drop my camera.

740
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:23,250
Oh, wait, no, that's my flash.

741
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:24,310
I'll drop everything, whatever.

742
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:26,950
What you got in there?

743
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:27,730
Nothing.

744
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:28,910
Okay.

745
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:31,170
Oh, there you go.

746
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:35,090
My camera has all the real photos.

747
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:38,530
It has all the real photos.

748
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,920
Oh, yeah, I like that one.

749
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,780
Okay, I think I'm good now.

750
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,120
What did we learn?

751
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,460
We've learned...

752
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,880
We learned about the emotes.

753
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,080
The most important part.

754
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,140
I think that's the best one we got.

755
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,600
I'm just basically like, screw the rules.

756
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah, for the photos.

757
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:14,700
Alright, you guys all ready?

758
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,680
Oh, yeah, Stephanie, go get your camera.

759
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:18,300
Oh, okay.

760
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:20,420
Did you ever play content warning, Snuffy?

761
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,420
I feel like this is just modern...

762
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:23,820
Or, you know...

763
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,880
This setting is...

764
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,640
Yeah, modern.

765
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:31,000
Or, no, no, Cloverfield content warning.

766
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:31,860
That's what it is.

767
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,260
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

768
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,660
This really looks like Cloverfield.

769
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,920
It's a movie where, like, a big old...

770
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,280
Godzilla type thing...

771
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,940
This is basically Cloverfield.

772
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:43,040
Right there.

773
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,960
Wait, this guy.

774
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,060
Okay, no, the monster.

775
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,100
The monster is Cloverfield.

776
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:54,640
It had, like, crazy ARG marketing when it first came out.

777
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,760
What was the name of the drink that was, like, responsible?

778
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,780
Like, there was a drinks company and they were drilling for the secret ingredient for the drink.

779
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:03,180
What?

780
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,960
The Cloverfield had a drink.

781
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:07,980
I swear to God, hold on.

782
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,060
Slusho.

783
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,400
Slusho, yeah, Slusho drinks.

784
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,540
Chat, we are in the natural habitat of hags right now as they...

785
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,780
As we discussed...

786
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,280
As they reminisced...

787
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,180
About the ARG...

788
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,800
The Slusho ARG.

789
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:38,000
I was just like, the ARG of Slusho.

790
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,200
The Slusho ARG.

791
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:44,240
You guys were alive when that...

792
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,640
You guys understood...

793
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,880
You guys were alive when...

794
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,140
When the ARG Cloverfield came out.

795
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,560
I'm gonna shine a fucking flashlight in your face the whole time.

796
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,320
I swear to God.

797
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,720
Arthur Square.

798
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,540
Danger level one.

799
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:04,740
Is she still with us?

800
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,160
There are only three people in here.

801
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,660
Where did she go?

802
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,020
We already lost someone.

803
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,120
We already lost.

804
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,480
Did she fall off the helicopter?

805
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:22,700
Hello?

806
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,280
Oh, no!

807
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:29,260
I'm sorry.

808
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,940
I can hear you.

809
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:32,920
That sucks.

810
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:33,800
I knew it would happen.

811
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:37,240
I was like, is Snoopy still here?

812
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:39,040
And then there were only three people in the helicopter.

813
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:40,000
No!

814
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:42,180
Snoopy!

815
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:42,740
Snoopy!

816
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,800
Yeah, like, who would've thought?

817
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,800
This game looks so, like, casual.

818
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,160
It does.

819
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,060
It's cause you're a raccoon.

820
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,760
Wait, it shows you're still in the game, though.

821
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,520
Yeah, maybe if you reloaded, you'll be in here.

822
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,600
Yeah, it shows current session, your name, and...

823
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,060
Snum!

824
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:21,900
I see you, Snum!

825
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:22,800
No, Snum!

826
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,340
Where are you, Snum?

827
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:28,260
I don't mean to weird you out, but there's a guy that keeps running by in his underwear.

828
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:43,800
I think maybe if you invite her back in, maybe it'll, like...

829
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

830
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:48,240
Let's see if it'll crash your OBS again.

831
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:04,400
I just see...

832
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,620
I just see Snum!

833
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,720
Oh, I see Snum there.

834
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,700
Guys...

835
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,300
Guys, there's...

836
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:26,000
There's people crying outside, guys.

837
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:06,990
It's alright!

838
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:08,970
Yeah, it's all good!

839
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:19,890
Your head keeps twisting!

840
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:22,010
Yeah, you keep doing this!

841
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,090
Bye, Posty!

842
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:40,390
Bye-bye!

843
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:41,130
Bye!

844
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:44,570
I'm so sad.

845
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:47,150
Guys, okay, now that...

846
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:49,010
Why on earth can we 360 our heads?

847
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:49,970
That's fucking...

848
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:50,490
I don't know.

849
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:54,070
We don't have a time limit, we have six minutes left.

850
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:56,170
We have six minutes to capture footage, yeah.

851
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:57,070
Yeah, so...

852
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:59,670
Guys, there was a lot of sounds around me, I'm really scared.

853
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:02,730
There was a guy in his underwear that ran past us at the very start.

854
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:07,550
I didn't want to disrupt the heartfelt conversation with Snuffy, but he fucking sprinted past us in his undies.

855
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:08,150
I was like, alright.

856
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:10,810
Maybe that was the monster.

857
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:13,310
The monster was inside us.

858
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:14,110
Oh, there he is!

859
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:15,990
Wait, that's a normal guy.

860
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:18,750
Oh, he's a survivor.

861
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:19,870
Hello, survivor.

862
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:21,190
Hello, survivor.

863
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,450
You have a witness account?

864
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:24,130
She's not interested in your shit.

865
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:26,370
Hello, can you give us a statement?

866
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:28,150
Can you give us a statement, real quick?

867
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:30,550
We just want to know, what did you see over there?

868
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:31,630
What did you see?

869
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:36,750
What did you see, sir?

870
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:39,550
One sentence from you.

871
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:47,250
Oh, goodbye.

872
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:51,770
Wait, there's a monster?

873
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:55,750
Oh shit, let's go!

874
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:57,350
Wait, pose in front of him!

875
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:58,230
Pose in front of him!

876
00:38:58,730 --> 00:38:59,850
Pose in front of him!

877
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:01,230
Here, I'll pose in front.

878
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:03,030
Where is he?

879
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:04,930
Right in front of you.

880
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:07,410
Alright, I got a photo.

881
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:10,050
Nice.

882
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:12,410
The dog alien.

883
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:13,190
Are you alive?

884
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:17,090
Holy shit, let me out!

885
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:17,610
Okay, okay, okay.

886
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:18,390
Wait, wait, wait.

887
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:19,530
Take a picture of this.

888
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:20,330
Wait, wait, wait.

889
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:21,010
Take a picture of this.

890
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:24,830
I'm next to the...

891
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:29,830
Dude, she's in fucking pieces on the floor.

892
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:30,530
Wait, wait, wait.

893
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:33,390
Okay, I'm going to wait until he finishes eating.

894
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:34,830
Alright, take a picture of this.

895
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:46,780
Alright, I got like enough for maybe one more picture.

896
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:46,980
Alright, I got like enough for maybe one more picture.

897
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:47,900
This camera sucks.

898
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,700
Alright, we got the photo.

899
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,280
Right there.

900
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:55,700
We got Mint's like horrible scattered corpse parts.

901
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,920
What more could we need?

902
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:59,200
Wait, I can use her body parts as weapons.

903
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:01,560
She got like absolutely murdered.

904
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,700
Okay, I'm going to grab a body part real quick.

905
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,020
Oh, there's a dude in his underwear!

906
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,000
Behind you!

907
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:14,560
Okay, we need to get her camera because she had photos too.

908
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:15,880
Oh shit!

909
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:16,300
Oh!

910
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,280
Whoops.

911
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,400
I threw that.

912
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,240
It's alright.

913
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,800
I got the real deal.

914
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:28,080
The guy with his underwear is just running around by the cars now.

915
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,160
Wait, wait, we need to take a picture of that.

916
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,140
We need to take a picture of that.

917
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:31,480
He's below us.

918
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,580
Look, I'm bringing Mint over.

919
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,560
That's right, move away.

920
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,320
I've covered wars, you know.

921
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,820
Wait, where's the underwear guy?

922
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,560
Wait, did Mint do that?

923
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,960
Hey, I tried to tell you!

924
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,420
Okay, how do we get out of here?

925
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,340
We just go back to the plane?

926
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,440
I think we just go back to the helicopter, yeah.

927
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,980
You know what, I feel like we did a good job.

928
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,340
Yeah, I got some cool pictures.

929
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,900
Yeah, look, and she's like here with us.

930
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,240
It's like she never died.

931
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,420
Do you think we get a reward for bringing back her torso?

932
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:09,920
I think so, let's try.

933
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:11,200
Okay.

934
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:13,500
Everyone's here.

935
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:17,320
Don't worry Mint, we're going to piece you back together and make Robocop.

936
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,240
We'll fix you right up.

937
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,260
I'm a journalist, you know.

938
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:25,600
Oh yeah, battle, thank you for the raid battle.

939
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,080
Alright, look, we did it!

940
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:28,280
We fixed her!

941
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,960
Oh look, yeah, no, you're doing great.

942
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,060
I told you!

943
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,800
We made it, we can rebuild her.

944
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:40,100
We're checking the results on the TV.

945
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,320
Check the results.

946
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:41,680
Alright, alright.

947
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,160
Do I have to like, plug in?

948
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:45,860
Results.

949
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,780
Oh, here we go.

950
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:48,020
Um...

951
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,120
Yeah, that's me!

952
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,920
Wait, why is it just me?

953
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,620
I got every good photo.

954
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:04,960
Yeah!

955
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,660
Where am I?

956
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,700
What do you mean, there you are.

957
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,520
I literally see you, you're right here.

958
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:20,720
Very good.

959
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:21,720
Good job, everybody.

960
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,720
Did we just take like, the top photo, I guess?

961
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,520
From everything, which would be this one.

962
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:36,260
Yeah, that's the top photo, because I got the dog alien, and then you dying, and then blood.

963
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:42,120
Oh, so we can buy like, more stuff now, like a pro camera, so we can take more photos.

964
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:47,900
I'm yelling at this for a while, it's like, ma'am, ma'am, what are you doing?

965
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:47,960
What are you doing?

966
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,380
And there's me dancing next to your body part.

967
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:59,640
Oh, we need to convert the points into photos, I'm sorry, into money, which I guess we can only do at the end.

968
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,480
Yeah, we just need...

969
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:06,340
Okay, so we have two more press badges, so we can do this two more times to get past the first level.

970
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:07,420
Yeah, got you, got you.

971
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:10,200
So we need to reach 1500 by the... Okay, got you, got you.

972
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:11,260
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

973
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,900
Min, why didn't you emote next to the...

974
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:17,260
Min, why didn't you emote next to the dog?

975
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:18,460
Like, we could've gotten more points.

976
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:20,680
Yeah, why didn't you fucking dab, dude?

977
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,660
Yeah, why didn't you dab?

978
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:24,600
Sorry, he came at me and then...

979
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:27,360
What university did you graduate to?

980
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:29,240
I don't even think you have a degree in journalism.

981
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:33,420
Well, then he attacked me again, so he can get you twice, I think.

982
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:35,760
Oh, wait, how do we get the plane to start?

983
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:40,020
I think it won't because Snuffy is still technically in the...

984
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:40,800
Oh, no, she's gone.

985
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:41,340
Oh, okay.

986
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,780
Hey, Mr. Dude.

987
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:47,100
Oh, oh, I need to equip a camera to...

988
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:48,620
Oh, you'll have a camera.

989
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:49,440
It's you.

990
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,600
Wait, there's no cameras here.

991
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:52,420
Oh.

992
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,200
Oh, no, no, you have to buy a camera.

993
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:58,920
I don't have any money.

994
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,660
No, it's your dollars.

995
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:01,760
The shit camera is free.

996
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,900
I don't get my flashlight back, though.

997
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:06,860
Thanks for grabbing that instead of, you know...

998
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:10,520
I rebuilt you.

999
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:13,080
Oh, that's the thanks I get after rebuilding you?

1000
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,260
Alright, I see.

1001
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,180
I literally rebuilt you from nothing.

1002
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,280
From just a torso.

1003
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:22,640
Okay, let's go.

1004
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:24,500
Alright.

1005
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:27,700
We're off to see everything in the city.

1006
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:35,880
Danger level one?

1007
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:36,580
Oh, my gosh.

1008
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,680
You died on the danger level one.

1009
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:39,520
Yeah, you did.

1010
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,420
Who told you to?

1011
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:43,920
Yeah, man, lock in.

1012
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:49,180
To be fair, she is a ghost, so she's pretty good at dying.

1013
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:58,880
I don't know.

1014
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:01,640
All those photos were of me, mostly, though.

1015
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:03,780
Is he still there?

1016
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:03,840
Is he still there?

1017
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,740
Alright, then we're free to go down.

1018
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:17,440
Hello?

1019
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,640
Oh, we can go in!

1020
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:21,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1021
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,300
Let's go in.

1022
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:27,080
I mean, it's threat level one.

1023
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,140
What is that?

1024
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:33,640
Oh, did you hear someone giggling?

1025
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,080
It's just a phone booth.

1026
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:35,700
Run away!

1027
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:36,180
Run away!

1028
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:39,020
Oh, it's a very spooky phone booth.

1029
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:40,760
Oh,

1030
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:44,970
I'm opening, too.

1031
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:46,410
Goodbye!

1032
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:49,250
Oh, I have to hold it.

1033
00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:49,950
Oh, hello!

1034
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:55,130
Oh, I'm going to take a photo right now.

1035
00:45:57,170 --> 00:45:58,690
Oh, I have a simple photo.

1036
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:00,510
Oh, what if I do a selfie?

1037
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:03,430
Guys, guys, guys, get over here!

1038
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:06,130
Guys, guys, guys, come on!

1039
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:06,710
What's up?

1040
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:08,070
Selfie time!

1041
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:10,290
What?

1042
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:12,170
What was that?

1043
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:13,850
No?

1044
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:15,910
Are you okay?

1045
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:18,070
Mint?

1046
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:21,530
Mint?

1047
00:46:22,330 --> 00:46:23,170
Are you sure?

1048
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:25,490
Alright, let's go in, then.

1049
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:27,490
I'm in.

1050
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:31,070
Are you getting PTSD from your OL days?

1051
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:34,610
What's with the mist above us?

1052
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:36,550
Do you see that?

1053
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:38,910
The ghostly essence?

1054
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:39,870
Yeah.

1055
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:44,770
What the hell was that?

1056
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:48,750
It was called a stalker, so I think maybe we don't want to get stalked.

1057
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:49,370
Are you hiding?

1058
00:46:52,130 --> 00:46:53,450
Wait, can we all be in here?

1059
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:56,510
No, but we can kick each other out.

1060
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:01,250
Someone is going to get fucking eaten.

1061
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:02,350
Oh, okay, we're good.

1062
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:03,850
We can move.

1063
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:05,630
I have a feeling a stalker isn't coming.

1064
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:06,770
I feel like he's going to come back.

1065
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:09,470
I'm fine in here.

1066
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:10,310
Be brave!

1067
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:14,250
I saw...

1068
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:16,690
I got a picture.

1069
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:18,650
Hold on, I'm going to emote on him.

1070
00:47:19,930 --> 00:47:20,930
Is he coming back?

1071
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:23,730
He's not here.

1072
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:25,010
We gotta get out.

1073
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:27,930
I got out.

1074
00:47:29,390 --> 00:47:30,710
We're right here.

1075
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:35,630
What the fuck?

1076
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:38,650
He's a hiding survivor.

1077
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:43,970
He's hiding, so he clearly knows what's going on.

1078
00:47:47,870 --> 00:47:49,390
What are you doing?

1079
00:47:50,730 --> 00:47:51,510
Can you fucking move?

1080
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:53,390
Do you have anything you want to tell us?

1081
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:54,870
Any statement you want to make?

1082
00:47:55,090 --> 00:47:56,150
I'm actually stuck.

1083
00:47:56,270 --> 00:48:01,230
Who is this?

1084
00:48:01,530 --> 00:48:02,690
He's a hiding survivor.

1085
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:03,770
He's here to hide.

1086
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:07,850
Every time I talk in game discord, I can see on my second monitor.

1087
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:09,270
It's like, you're currently muted.

1088
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:11,970
Look at him.

1089
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:17,430
There's like a trap here.

1090
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:18,070
Oh shit.

1091
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:20,210
It's a constant warning trap.

1092
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:29,630
You don't have good photos, right?

1093
00:48:38,970 --> 00:48:40,930
Is this guy actually following us?

1094
00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:43,110
He's probably shit scared.

1095
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:45,610
We should trick him into the trap so we can take a picture of him getting eaten.

1096
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:46,510
True, true, true.

1097
00:48:47,370 --> 00:48:48,590
We're awful people.

1098
00:48:49,270 --> 00:48:49,930
No, we're not.

1099
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:50,650
We're journalists.

1100
00:48:51,590 --> 00:48:54,430
Maybe move onto the other side of the trap so he can follow us.

1101
00:48:54,530 --> 00:48:55,330
He's kind of fixated.

1102
00:48:56,570 --> 00:48:58,710
I think he's fixated on you.

1103
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:01,950
Hey kid, come on.

1104
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:03,590
Let's go somewhere safe.

1105
00:49:03,830 --> 00:49:04,350
Over here.

1106
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,670
Here he comes.

1107
00:49:08,930 --> 00:49:09,770
Get your cameras ready.

1108
00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:11,670
Come on.

1109
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:22,020
Come on.

1110
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:23,600
It's going all technical outside.

1111
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:24,720
That's probably bad.

1112
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:26,460
Is it?

1113
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:28,300
It kind of went all purple out there.

1114
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:29,440
It's just rain.

1115
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:31,480
It's just acid rain.

1116
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:34,080
Oh no, it's the lighting system in here.

1117
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:34,820
Okay, we're fine.

1118
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,120
I feel like we should go back.

1119
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:37,960
We have a lot of good photos now, right?

1120
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:41,760
Oh, I see it.

1121
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:43,460
What was it?

1122
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:44,780
It's in the other room.

1123
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:46,160
I saw red eyes running around.

1124
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,040
It's a soccer.

1125
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,120
Wait, how did we get back?

1126
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:50,540
I don't remember where we came from.

1127
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:51,560
This way.

1128
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:53,320
Up the stairs.

1129
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:56,780
We're actually leaving?

1130
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,180
Did we really come from up the stairs?

1131
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,080
No, it's not up the stairs.

1132
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:02,400
I don't think so.

1133
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,780
It was through here.

1134
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:06,720
Oh, I can't see anything.

1135
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,180
Wait, I don't have a...

1136
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:08,780
You're here.

1137
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:09,240
I got you.

1138
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:11,780
It was here because there's a locker.

1139
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:13,300
And that's where I took a photo of you.

1140
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:15,980
Yeah, and it's straight through here.

1141
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,220
Yeah, I think we should go back.

1142
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:18,940
I think we have all the photos we need, right?

1143
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,860
Six photos I can take.

1144
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:23,740
I'm about halfway through mine.

1145
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:25,520
So it depends on whether or not we want to risk dying.

1146
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:26,840
Yeah, I don't want to risk dying.

1147
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,880
We have some sick ass photos for the news.

1148
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,600
There might be some shit in the square as well.

1149
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:31,580
We're gonna get eaten.

1150
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:33,760
Ladies first.

1151
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:37,380
Alright.

1152
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:38,760
Everything seems safe.

1153
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:39,760
There's no dogs here.

1154
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,680
Oh, there's two dogs.

1155
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:43,780
Oh, there's two dogs.

1156
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:45,420
Is that a not dog?

1157
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:47,760
That's three enemies right there.

1158
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:49,860
Can you zoom?

1159
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:51,580
Look at them go.

1160
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,040
Oh, fleeing survivor dead.

1161
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:57,560
Is this like Lethal Company where the longer you're out, the more...

1162
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:58,420
I don't think so.

1163
00:50:58,420 --> 00:50:59,520
I think it's just RNG.

1164
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:00,580
I'm pretty sure.

1165
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:03,900
Oh god, can you actually make that?

1166
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:06,380
Parkour.

1167
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:08,260
I can't get up there.

1168
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:09,480
Guys, don't come over here.

1169
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:11,020
You'll get stuck, JK.

1170
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:22,580
Parkour.

1171
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:34,170
Oh wait, apparently the longer we're out here, the more likely monsters spawn.

1172
00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:35,250
You're right.

1173
00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:44,290
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

1174
00:51:44,290 --> 00:51:44,430
Hurry.

1175
00:51:47,350 --> 00:51:49,590
The longer we're out here, the more monsters there are.

1176
00:51:55,890 --> 00:51:57,210
Alright, let's go, let's go, let's go.

1177
00:51:57,710 --> 00:51:59,150
There's a monster below us.

1178
00:52:00,110 --> 00:52:00,630
To our right.

1179
00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:02,850
So we gotta book it, we gotta book it.

1180
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:03,850
He's like right to the right.

1181
00:52:04,770 --> 00:52:05,870
Okay, where?

1182
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:08,510
What do you mean where?

1183
00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:09,110
We're gonna go.

1184
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:12,370
Alright, three, two, one.

1185
00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:13,450
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

1186
00:52:13,450 --> 00:52:13,530
Go.

1187
00:52:15,490 --> 00:52:18,130
I'm booking, I'm running as fast as I can.

1188
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:25,760
Guys?

1189
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:28,360
Guys?

1190
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:30,820
Guys?

1191
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,500
Guys, there is a monster right in front of me.

1192
00:52:43,590 --> 00:52:44,270
Guys?

1193
00:52:44,270 --> 00:52:44,470
Guys?

1194
00:52:50,830 --> 00:53:05,450
Oh my god, he's right there.

1195
00:53:05,610 --> 00:53:08,190
Turn around, turn around, take a photo, take a photo of him.

1196
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:10,030
Nice.

1197
00:53:14,410 --> 00:53:17,110
I can just hear you in the distance like, guys?

1198
00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:26,070
I can't believe you fuckers left me.

1199
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:27,830
I can't, I'll...

1200
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:32,070
Doki bird will remember this.

1201
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:34,190
Doki bird will remember this.

1202
00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:39,490
I got a great photo while you were running.

1203
00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:43,610
Alright, who's gonna have the top photos?

1204
00:53:43,610 --> 00:53:45,290
What is that?

1205
00:53:45,970 --> 00:53:48,890
You streaked in front of me as I was taking a photo.

1206
00:53:49,050 --> 00:53:49,870
It was really funny.

1207
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:51,090
Number four.

1208
00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:52,230
Number three.

1209
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:53,310
Yes, my photo.

1210
00:53:55,410 --> 00:53:56,670
What is that?

1211
00:53:57,030 --> 00:53:57,770
What is that?

1212
00:53:59,870 --> 00:54:00,690
Oh, that's...

1213
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:07,470
That's right, that's right.

1214
00:54:07,670 --> 00:54:09,250
It was me yet again.

1215
00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:14,450
It was my photo again.

1216
00:54:14,770 --> 00:54:17,610
Wait, you didn't even get a single photo in top five.

1217
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,640
We can afford exactly one thing.

1218
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:26,620
What is it?

1219
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,280
Do you want a pro camera?

1220
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:31,340
Or do you want, maybe...

1221
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:31,780
A helmet?

1222
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:33,400
What is a helmet for?

1223
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:34,560
I guess a helmet is for more...

1224
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:38,160
I guess we could give a helmet to Mint and then use her as bait more.

1225
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:41,060
Hold on.

1226
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:43,000
It's plus 25% health.

1227
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:44,960
Then...

1228
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,440
The trap will block monsters.

1229
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:48,940
We could buy Mint a flashlight.

1230
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:50,500
She doesn't need one.

1231
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,440
We have two flashlights.

1232
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:53,300
That's more than enough.

1233
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:54,980
Okay.

1234
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:57,840
There's a zoom camera too for Doki.

1235
00:54:58,020 --> 00:54:59,700
Because she doesn't like to get close to anything.

1236
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,980
True, but there's also a camera that lets you take 15 pictures.

1237
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:05,000
I got the best photo in that game.

1238
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,980
And I was very close to you guys.

1239
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:09,700
Do you want the 15 pictures camera?

1240
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:10,700
Or the zoom camera?

1241
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:11,280
Or the flash camera?

1242
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,220
I feel like the zoom camera would be better, right?

1243
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:17,080
You get less score for it.

1244
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:19,180
The flashy camera might be good.

1245
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:20,740
Because we don't have to rely on the flashlight.

1246
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:22,960
True, true.

1247
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:24,960
The pro camera has the best pictures.

1248
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:26,080
For what it's worth.

1249
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:26,920
So you get more score.

1250
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:28,760
So we should get the pro camera then.

1251
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,420
I think they have the pro camera then.

1252
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:31,620
So that we can get more money.

1253
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:33,380
Yeah, I'm gonna use the bathroom real quick.

1254
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:34,300
I'll be right back.

1255
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:34,800
Okay.

1256
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:39,300
Mine.

1257
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:43,260
Do you want the pro camera?

1258
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,040
No, you can have it.

1259
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,160
You're gonna get the best shot of all of us now.

1260
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:50,280
Yeah, that's the plan.

1261
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,500
Your guy is so close to me right now.

1262
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:54,060
He's like, do you want the pro camera?

1263
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:56,280
While basically licking my nose.

1264
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:57,820
Do you want the pro camera?

1265
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:00,060
I really like your eyeliner.

1266
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:03,880
I can see every one of your pores.

1267
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,260
It goes around your whole eyes.

1268
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:07,040
Wow.

1269
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:15,000
I haven't had the use of both of my nostrils.

1270
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:16,540
Since like, I don't know.

1271
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:17,400
Friday.

1272
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:18,460
No.

1273
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:22,100
So you're like.

1274
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:23,840
The color of your hair for real.

1275
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:25,020
Yeah.

1276
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:27,660
What were you?

1277
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:29,880
We're not the sloppy sisters today.

1278
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:31,300
You guys were the snotty sisters.

1279
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:32,000
It's true.

1280
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:33,860
Alright, I'm back.

1281
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:37,440
Did you wash your hands?

1282
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:38,560
Yeah, I did.

1283
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:39,700
Alright, where's the pro camera?

1284
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:41,140
Who has it?

1285
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:45,460
Mint has it because Mint has clearly got a great track record for taking good pictures.

1286
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:45,800
Damn it.

1287
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:46,840
Let's see again.

1288
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:47,940
Let's see.

1289
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,560
Which photo did you get in the top five?

1290
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:51,380
This is the front line news?

1291
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:53,880
I'm sorry, this is the front news?

1292
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:55,040
What is this?

1293
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:58,200
And who's with that photo?

1294
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:03,760
It looks like you're in a compromising picture with that fucking monster, if I'm gonna be honest.

1295
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:09,840
Breaking news, I've uncovered a secret relationship.

1296
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:12,720
She really was the freak phantom.

1297
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,400
Oh wait, the monster is in that picture.

1298
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:16,880
Yeah, she's literally right there next to you.

1299
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:19,220
She's like right there.

1300
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:20,340
Wow.

1301
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:24,180
That's right, I have a scandal right there.

1302
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:27,180
Extra, extra, read all about it.

1303
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:29,520
Mint got caught with her pants down.

1304
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,340
It's not a scandal if I welcome it.

1305
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:38,200
Oh yeah, I had relations with that monster.

1306
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:40,500
I had relations.

1307
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:43,960
Let's go.

1308
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,440
Do you think we'll get the scarier map now?

1309
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,620
Mint's gonna die with the pro camera.

1310
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:50,840
Oh yeah, probably.

1311
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,860
We have a higher thing now too.

1312
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:54,620
All we have in the world is $100.

1313
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:56,820
Mint's definitely not gonna die with the pro camera.

1314
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:59,740
She's gonna die with the pro camera.

1315
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:08,200
I didn't know if that would come through on the loading screen.

1316
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:13,280
Oh, this is a new one.

1317
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,920
Yeah, because we finished the last one.

1318
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,000
Don't die.

1319
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:19,180
Who are you saying that to?

1320
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:19,920
Mint or me?

1321
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:22,300
This is Adelaide.

1322
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:28,180
That's true.

1323
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:34,680
Oh.

1324
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:38,240
Oh, we might be able to get a panorama shot.

1325
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,400
My eyes are up here.

1326
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:47,960
Ladder, ladder, ladder.

1327
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,640
You gotta say ladder, ladder, ladder when you climb.

1328
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:51,160
It's the rule.

1329
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:55,020
Oh, do we have to parkour here?

1330
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:55,700
Oh god.

1331
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:57,160
I'm gonna do it.

1332
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:57,640
Parkour!

1333
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:02,620
Okay, watch this.

1334
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:06,380
Parkour.

1335
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:07,380
Very good.

1336
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:09,680
We're the best journalists ever?

1337
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:11,200
Yeah.

1338
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:13,340
Oh, there's a ladder over here too.

1339
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:15,600
Oh, there's a light.

1340
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:16,160
There's a green light.

1341
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:18,700
There's doors below us.

1342
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:19,660
Alright, let's go down.

1343
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:21,660
Jump.

1344
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:22,800
Yeah, do a flip.

1345
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:23,540
Do a flip, Mint.

1346
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:26,840
How do you safely use these fucking ladders?

1347
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:29,160
There's fall damage.

1348
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:43,460
I'm kind of stuck on the ladder.

1349
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:44,260
Okay, here we go.

1350
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:46,340
This is very dangerous.

1351
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:47,300
Holy shit.

1352
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:55,840
Look, as a journalist, you have to take risks, guys.

1353
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:01,600
You have to take risks as a journalist, guys.

1354
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:04,220
Who would take risks if not me?

1355
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,780
I was doing it for the people.

1356
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,980
Look, we found out that gravity works in this world.

1357
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:16,180
That elevator is smoking.

1358
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:19,900
Oh my god, let me take my Buckley's while we wait.

1359
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:23,760
Let me take my fucking meds while we wait.

1360
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:26,500
Wait, what?

1361
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:31,020
Oh shit, what the fuck?

1362
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:32,160
Wow!

1363
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:35,260
That's fucking gross, though.

1364
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:39,020
Do you want me to pose for it?

1365
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:42,220
Do you want me to pose for it?

1366
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:44,080
I can hear a monster.

1367
01:00:44,620 --> 01:00:46,540
Me too.

1368
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:47,500
Wow!

1369
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:52,260
Extra, extra, read all about it.

1370
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:56,140
Guy gets slowly absorbed by the law.

1371
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:59,100
Journalist quoted saying, wow!

1372
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:02,880
Place is pretty spooky.

1373
01:01:04,140 --> 01:01:04,540
A little.

1374
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:06,740
I like the echoing.

1375
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:08,280
I know me too.

1376
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:09,760
You're good.

1377
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:11,420
You saw her torso outside.

1378
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:14,740
I know she's watching right now.

1379
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:23,080
I can hear her.

1380
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:25,180
Taking my shtick, man.

1381
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:28,400
No, there's nothing in here.

1382
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:31,540
I guess we can check the security cameras.

1383
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:33,420
Hold on.

1384
01:01:33,580 --> 01:01:34,260
Do you hear it?

1385
01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:43,030
Where's your camera?

1386
01:01:43,510 --> 01:01:46,010
You're alive, you have no leg.

1387
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:47,010
Let's go, let's go.

1388
01:01:47,110 --> 01:01:48,270
You are missing a leg.

1389
01:01:52,530 --> 01:01:54,650
You are so fucking dead.

1390
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:57,310
The rest of you is dead.

1391
01:01:57,770 --> 01:01:58,990
The pro camera!

1392
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:01,110
The pro camera!

1393
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:09,680
Wait, can you hear me, man?

1394
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:15,880
It was me that slapped the table.

1395
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:20,580
I slapped the table and you're like...

1396
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:27,920
No, I unmuted Discord and slapped the table.

1397
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:34,100
I made a loud thump noise.

1398
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:34,200
I made a loud thump noise.

1399
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,420
You thought it was the game, but it was me.

1400
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:44,540
It was me.

1401
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:52,560
Look at that, Mitt.

1402
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:54,080
You died with the pro camera.

1403
01:02:57,720 --> 01:02:59,260
I had to test the theory out.

1404
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:02,160
Nobody was willing to take the risk but me.

1405
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:10,360
What cause?

1406
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:11,620
I'm gonna die going down the ladder.

1407
01:03:12,220 --> 01:03:17,120
If that number one photo is my fucking discombobulated body, you're welcome.

1408
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:22,980
It's gonna be my little alien photo.

1409
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:25,400
Oh my god, what if she like misses the jump?

1410
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:32,860
She's got a lot of time, but I guess because we're all dead...

1411
01:03:32,860 --> 01:03:37,480
If I wasn't dead, we would have been able to win this.

1412
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:38,760
Oh.

1413
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:41,920
Yeah, I see it.

1414
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:43,320
You see that thing crawling?

1415
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:44,720
In front of us?

1416
01:03:47,140 --> 01:03:48,160
You see that in front of her?

1417
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:49,440
It's literally in front of her.

1418
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:53,540
Lava, turn around!

1419
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:57,380
Your life is not as important as the news.

1420
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:05,260
No problem.

1421
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:06,780
Yeah, she got the pro camera.

1422
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:08,920
The camera that matters.

1423
01:04:23,730 --> 01:04:24,370
Okay,

1424
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:30,170
let's see if it counts as your photo.

1425
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:36,600
Top photo.

1426
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:40,040
Oh boy.

1427
01:04:44,140 --> 01:04:45,180
It's me!

1428
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:53,000
That's you before you died.

1429
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:55,480
Here you go, Min.

1430
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:57,980
You put a lot of effort.

1431
01:04:58,080 --> 01:04:59,540
You sacrificed your life for that shit.

1432
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:03,780
That's a good one.

1433
01:05:03,860 --> 01:05:04,900
He's like raising the roof.

1434
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:06,300
That thing was smart.

1435
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:06,820
Did you see?

1436
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:10,320
I tried to lead him around the thing and he immediately kind of figured it out and moved back.

1437
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:11,360
Oh, that's crazy.

1438
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:13,560
Scared as that was.

1439
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:14,420
Level 2.

1440
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:17,200
Yeah, level 2?

1441
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:18,960
I want to know where the big monster is.

1442
01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:20,560
You saw the big monster photos?

1443
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:21,400
Yeah.

1444
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:23,720
He was resistant though.

1445
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:25,060
That was scary.

1446
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:28,560
Okay, now that I know how hard it is to take photos...

1447
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:30,880
These photos are actually really, really good.

1448
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:32,700
I know, right?

1449
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:33,760
Oh my god.

1450
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:35,850
This one is so epic.

1451
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:39,400
The one in front of the crotch.

1452
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:41,820
These are really good.

1453
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:43,420
Yeah, these are actually really good.

1454
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:45,420
This one looks like he's running away.

1455
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:47,980
While things are being flipped towards him.

1456
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:48,860
Yeah, the selfie ones are really hard.

1457
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:52,500
Wait, someone said you should be able to pick up all dropped cameras.

1458
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:53,980
Oh, really?

1459
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:55,640
Okay, I threw mine for you.

1460
01:05:55,820 --> 01:05:57,160
But I didn't know if I could actually not.

1461
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:59,240
Maybe we should send this photo to the devs.

1462
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:00,880
And be like a scandal.

1463
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,360
Yeah, that's not too bad.

1464
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:03,960
Between a journalist and an alien.

1465
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:08,280
You're obsessed with this photo.

1466
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:11,900
I mean, it's a pretty...

1467
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:13,240
Not being jealous of my love life, huh?

1468
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:16,400
It's a pretty good photo, not gonna lie.

1469
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:17,780
Are you guys ready?

1470
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:19,920
On my way.

1471
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:20,880
I'm ready!

1472
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:24,940
Apparently, the big monsters appear in the last minute.

1473
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:28,180
So we stay in the last minute.

1474
01:06:28,180 --> 01:06:29,600
We could get a big monster.

1475
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:31,140
Alright.

1476
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,860
So for this one...

1477
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:38,340
For this one, we just stay until the last minute then.

1478
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:39,320
Yeah.

1479
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:42,380
If we chill by the helicopter, we should be good.

1480
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:44,760
Live life on the edge.

1481
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:47,820
Oh, you hear that?

1482
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:50,120
I hear something going...

1483
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:52,740
I didn't hear it.

1484
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:55,500
Oh, I see a green light.

1485
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:57,060
Have we been there before?

1486
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:57,960
That green light?

1487
01:06:59,660 --> 01:07:02,140
We got a different way because we didn't go up onto the roof immediately.

1488
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:02,680
Oh, true.

1489
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:05,340
Wait, no, this is the same way to the same place.

1490
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:07,500
We never went forward though.

1491
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,440
Have we ever went forward?

1492
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:15,640
We could go this way and go into that main building.

1493
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:16,600
We didn't go there last time.

1494
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:17,480
Oh, yeah, let's try that.

1495
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:19,400
What could go wrong?

1496
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:20,140
Exactly, guys.

1497
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:20,980
What could go wrong?

1498
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:24,500
Hey, look, Doki, on the right there is where you turned into a pancake.

1499
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:25,220
Oh, that's me!

1500
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:26,320
That's where I was!

1501
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:30,920
Oh, look, there's a whole different section over there that we could go up eventually.

1502
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:31,600
That's cool.

1503
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:32,440
Oh, okay.

1504
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:33,600
Yeah, we go to the side, right?

1505
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:34,160
Right here?

1506
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:36,040
Oh, no, we went in that one last time.

1507
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:36,540
Oh, okay.

1508
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:38,820
Yeah, well, you guys went there last time.

1509
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:39,700
I was dead.

1510
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:44,800
Oh, no, it's the same building.

1511
01:07:46,580 --> 01:07:47,960
Two doors, same building.

1512
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:49,820
That's weird.

1513
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:51,560
Oh, wait, no, the benches are different.

1514
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:52,960
We could go through the elevator.

1515
01:07:53,580 --> 01:07:56,580
Oh, there's some monster bloody stuff in here.

1516
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:57,880
Oh, Goopy.

1517
01:07:58,400 --> 01:07:59,000
Follow me.

1518
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:02,240
Wait, pose next to her.

1519
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:03,240
Emo, what were you?

1520
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:03,920
Emo.

1521
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:10,260
There's something in here.

1522
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:11,440
Something just opened the door.

1523
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:13,600
Hello?

1524
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:15,680
Oh, I saw it.

1525
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:16,700
A little thing just ran by.

1526
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:17,040
Hello?

1527
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:22,540
Yeah, I think it's the guy that bit off...

1528
01:08:22,540 --> 01:08:22,940
Wait, what?

1529
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:25,720
What?

1530
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:27,700
A little baby?

1531
01:08:27,820 --> 01:08:28,500
Can we kick the baby?

1532
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:31,840
Alright, let's go.

1533
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:34,900
I ain't scared of a little baby.

1534
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:40,680
I couldn't possibly imagine why.

1535
01:08:40,860 --> 01:08:42,180
You should definitely go find out.

1536
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:45,080
Guys, where's the little baby, guys?

1537
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:51,100
Oh, I see what you did there.

1538
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:52,820
Little baby.

1539
01:08:54,420 --> 01:08:55,680
She didn't notice.

1540
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:57,580
No, she didn't.

1541
01:08:58,620 --> 01:09:00,280
She lacks critical information.

1542
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:01,920
I'm not a baby.

1543
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:05,940
What's this?

1544
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:06,800
What is that?

1545
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:08,420
Is it a breaker box?

1546
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:10,540
Doesn't do nothing.

1547
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:15,700
Is this going to be one of those games, like Lethal Company, where if you find a monster, you're basically just dead?

1548
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:16,820
I don't know.

1549
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:19,480
I think that's what the traps are for.

1550
01:09:20,980 --> 01:09:23,160
Alright, guys, do a pose.

1551
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:26,080
I'm not letting you get the best photo.

1552
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:26,800
You do a pose.

1553
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:27,560
Okay, fine.

1554
01:09:30,820 --> 01:09:33,600
Wait, wait, wait.

1555
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:37,100
Does it look like I'm cool next to it?

1556
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:38,760
Wait, wait, wait.

1557
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:40,720
Look.

1558
01:09:41,220 --> 01:09:41,940
Against the wall.

1559
01:09:41,940 --> 01:09:43,860
Wait, do it again, do it again.

1560
01:09:50,820 --> 01:09:52,580
I'm trying not to waste my stamina.

1561
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:57,640
I'm like, trying to keep the doors closed behind us so that we hear if something's coming up behind us.

1562
01:09:57,780 --> 01:09:59,880
You're so smart.

1563
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,480
That's why she lived and we died.

1564
01:10:02,380 --> 01:10:02,740
I know.

1565
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:10,200
I mean, that's exactly why I'm not smart enough.

1566
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:12,580
This room is huge.

1567
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:14,820
There's more annihilation stuff over there.

1568
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:17,960
I thought it looked like annihilation.

1569
01:10:18,740 --> 01:10:19,680
It's your life.

1570
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:25,520
It's a movie where you go into this world and then you get absorbed into it.

1571
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:31,860
It's about a prism that instead of refracting light, it refracts.

1572
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:32,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1573
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:37,040
You look like you're kind of pissing on it.

1574
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:37,540
I'm not going to lie.

1575
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:41,860
Does that work?

1576
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:45,800
What was that?

1577
01:10:46,540 --> 01:10:47,160
It's the radio.

1578
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:48,400
It's a radio broadcast.

1579
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:52,260
That's freaky.

1580
01:10:53,660 --> 01:10:54,860
We're at the news station.

1581
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:55,980
Yeah.

1582
01:10:56,320 --> 01:11:00,360
We should see if there's a way out of this building but not having to go all the way back.

1583
01:11:01,180 --> 01:11:01,900
That's going to take forever.

1584
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:05,020
It's a little spooky, not going to lie.

1585
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:06,880
It is a little spooky.

1586
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:08,260
What happens if you stand on it?

1587
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:10,640
Probably nothing good.

1588
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:12,560
Alright guys, are we ready?

1589
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:12,640
Alright.

1590
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:15,100
Are you doing that again?

1591
01:11:15,860 --> 01:11:18,000
Wait, we can be the news now.

1592
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:19,020
Oh my god, you're right.

1593
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:23,900
My fellow Americans.

1594
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:25,140
What?

1595
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:31,220
Where did it go?

1596
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:32,880
I got a photo!

1597
01:11:35,860 --> 01:11:38,040
I got a cool photo though.

1598
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:39,160
And you kept your leg.

1599
01:11:40,180 --> 01:11:40,580
Yeah.

1600
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:43,820
Oh my god, it's so cool.

1601
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:46,520
Wait, where did that photo go?

1602
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:53,480
Wait, that's not good.

1603
01:11:53,820 --> 01:11:54,480
The baby's back.

1604
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:55,920
Where's the baby?

1605
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:58,220
I don't know, but I can hear him.

1606
01:11:58,980 --> 01:12:00,280
New York is under attack.

1607
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:02,280
We should probably get away.

1608
01:12:02,740 --> 01:12:03,620
I think so too.

1609
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:06,060
Standing here is a good idea.

1610
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:08,220
No, it's probably not.

1611
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:11,080
Alright, let's get out of here.

1612
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:12,000
I'm watching your back.

1613
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:14,140
Thanks very much.

1614
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:15,160
Oh, I'm so fucking dead.

1615
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:15,720
It's so dark.

1616
01:12:17,580 --> 01:12:20,520
We can use the camera for night vision.

1617
01:12:22,580 --> 01:12:23,580
There's goop on the floor.

1618
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:24,800
That's a trap, isn't it?

1619
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:26,440
It could be.

1620
01:12:26,980 --> 01:12:28,740
We don't have a survivor though to test it.

1621
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,700
I mean, we have three survivors right here.

1622
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:34,520
Excuse me, I'm a journalist.

1623
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:36,060
Oh wait, this is a dead end.

1624
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:38,960
Lethal company-ass looking fucking corridor.

1625
01:12:39,140 --> 01:12:39,360
I know!

1626
01:12:39,940 --> 01:12:42,240
Wait, this is also a dead end.

1627
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:43,860
Yeah, this place sucks.

1628
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:46,900
We could try and book it out the way we came.

1629
01:12:46,900 --> 01:12:47,760
What about the left side?

1630
01:12:48,740 --> 01:12:49,680
Oh, there's a bed over here.

1631
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:53,900
I mean, these doors are open.

1632
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:54,540
Fucking corridors.

1633
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:56,560
Oh, what's this?

1634
01:12:58,400 --> 01:12:59,320
Oh wait, guys!

1635
01:13:00,260 --> 01:13:01,880
Oh yeah, we found it!

1636
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:02,500
We did it!

1637
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:03,040
We're heroes!

1638
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:06,480
Goodbye.

1639
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:08,860
Goodbye, Mint.

1640
01:13:09,940 --> 01:13:10,420
Goodbye.

1641
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:14,840
Goodbye.

1642
01:13:17,980 --> 01:13:18,340
Goodbye.

1643
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:24,400
When I leave a room, I spawn inside someone's fucking head.

1644
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,180
I feel like we have to be on the roof at this point.

1645
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:26,920
I see your eyeballs.

1646
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:29,140
Oh my god, there's a survivor.

1647
01:13:29,140 --> 01:13:30,500
That's a man with a gun.

1648
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:31,860
That's a man with a bazooka.

1649
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:35,420
He's here!

1650
01:13:36,740 --> 01:13:38,260
Oh my god!

1651
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:45,040
Oh my god, military men!

1652
01:13:47,820 --> 01:13:48,800
Wait, let me pause.

1653
01:13:49,140 --> 01:13:49,560
It's Godzilla!

1654
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:54,840
Hello!

1655
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:10,080
Look over there!

1656
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:12,360
Oh my god, he's right there!

1657
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:30,060
We should run.

1658
01:14:30,740 --> 01:14:31,940
Run, run, run.

1659
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:35,080
Guys, I didn't put a photo.

1660
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:37,420
Oh my god, there he is!

1661
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:49,960
All I'm saying is that I did it for the photo.

1662
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:52,000
I like how the helicopter pilot is totally fine.

1663
01:14:52,140 --> 01:14:53,140
They can rebuild me.

1664
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:54,560
They can rebuild me.

1665
01:14:56,140 --> 01:14:57,460
For the vibe.

1666
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:58,580
I did it for the vibe!

1667
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:03,660
I am a real journalist.

1668
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:04,960
You guys don't care.

1669
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:06,460
You guys don't care enough.

1670
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:08,280
Okay, okay.

1671
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:11,980
I have a pro camera.

1672
01:15:11,980 --> 01:15:13,120
Girl, I'm like...

1673
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:15,820
I got so many downward photos from you.

1674
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:20,840
If I am in that photo for a top result, you're welcome.

1675
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:22,580
Oh, look at him.

1676
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:23,340
He's so cute.

1677
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:24,620
Wow!

1678
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:27,320
Oh yeah, Miss Pro Camera.

1679
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:29,920
Where's my photo?

1680
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:32,160
I like how the picture of the ass got more views.

1681
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:35,100
It's me!

1682
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:39,800
Hell yeah!

1683
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:41,720
What did we get?

1684
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:43,200
Oh, we made it to the next level!

1685
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:44,480
Nice!

1686
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:47,520
Should we even like...

1687
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:48,680
wait for the small guys?

1688
01:15:48,820 --> 01:15:50,420
All the pictures of the big guys...

1689
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:52,720
I feel like we should just win the Darwin Award.

1690
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:55,480
Just sit in the helicopter until they show up.

1691
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:58,220
Someone else can use the pro camera if you want.

1692
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:00,920
We can actually buy another one if you want to.

1693
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:01,940
Let's get two pro cameras.

1694
01:16:01,940 --> 01:16:03,580
I can get a pro flashlight instead.

1695
01:16:03,580 --> 01:16:04,620
Oh yeah, maybe.

1696
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:09,680
I will get a pro flashlight this time then.

1697
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:10,740
Is this the pro camera?

1698
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:12,640
That's me, guys.

1699
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:12,940
Look.

1700
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:14,860
There I am, next to the dinosaur.

1701
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:17,080
Do we need another flashlight?

1702
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:18,600
We can take another flashlight.

1703
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:20,300
No, I don't think you're in this one.

1704
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:24,540
No, I'm not in the one that won, but I was second place.

1705
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:26,300
There you go.

1706
01:16:26,380 --> 01:16:27,780
Pro flashlight obtained.

1707
01:16:28,820 --> 01:16:29,680
I was in this one.

1708
01:16:29,940 --> 01:16:30,200
I got it.

1709
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:30,720
That's me.

1710
01:16:31,380 --> 01:16:32,000
Oh yeah, that's you.

1711
01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:35,600
I'm like, yeah, ADS got the picture.

1712
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:42,540
There's two flashlights there, so we can all have one.

1713
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:45,420
Doki, did you get a flashlight?

1714
01:16:45,420 --> 01:16:46,420
Yeah, I got it.

1715
01:16:47,620 --> 01:16:48,660
Alright, let's go.

1716
01:16:49,380 --> 01:16:51,020
Let's go get some big guys.

1717
01:16:51,380 --> 01:16:52,560
Let's get some good photos.

1718
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:55,240
Alright, so we just gotta live until one minute or something.

1719
01:16:55,980 --> 01:16:56,600
Or two minutes?

1720
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:58,040
You showed up in the two minute mark.

1721
01:16:58,120 --> 01:16:59,940
It wasn't one minute.

1722
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:05,000
Oh, we're in Chinatown.

1723
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:10,160
The more photos we get though, the better we do, so it's still worth getting the others because we got 5,000 points.

1724
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:15,680
I feel like the big monsters show up like here, so we can't be in this area.

1725
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:21,020
Yeah, well probably if we just stand here waiting for the monster, it will just obliterate us.

1726
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:22,680
Yeah, I feel like that's what's gonna happen.

1727
01:17:23,620 --> 01:17:24,380
That's true.

1728
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:25,960
Cool.

1729
01:17:27,940 --> 01:17:28,380
Spooky.

1730
01:17:29,580 --> 01:17:31,740
I like the lanterns.

1731
01:17:31,780 --> 01:17:33,800
I can like peek in through other people's windows.

1732
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:35,220
I'm like a little peeping tom.

1733
01:17:35,380 --> 01:17:37,320
Don't take photos in there.

1734
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:39,100
What are you guys doing in there?

1735
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:40,040
Picture!

1736
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:42,680
Someone changing!

1737
01:17:44,380 --> 01:17:50,020
I bet you when the monster shows up, you could use this ladder to get a really good high aerial shot.

1738
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:51,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1739
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:54,080
Get a pose in front of it.

1740
01:17:54,140 --> 01:17:56,760
That's how they get the poses, like staring at the monster.

1741
01:17:57,860 --> 01:17:59,440
Like a movie poster.

1742
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:01,260
Oh, there's a panorama.

1743
01:18:01,820 --> 01:18:02,620
Oh, it's a mall!

1744
01:18:02,860 --> 01:18:03,860
I wanna go to the mall.

1745
01:18:04,140 --> 01:18:06,800
Let's all go to the mall tonight.

1746
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:09,380
Alright, let's go.

1747
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:13,340
I'll provide flashlight services first, so you guys don't waste yours.

1748
01:18:13,860 --> 01:18:14,720
Okay, are you sure?

1749
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:16,100
Wait, what's this?

1750
01:18:17,380 --> 01:18:18,920
You can do flashlight.

1751
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:19,700
What is that?

1752
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:22,100
I think those are just lights glowing in the dark.

1753
01:18:22,540 --> 01:18:23,360
Did you hear that?

1754
01:18:24,140 --> 01:18:27,120
Oh, there's a big thing above us on the left part there.

1755
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:29,560
I hear him.

1756
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:32,260
I hear him.

1757
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:35,440
Where do we go, lad?

1758
01:18:36,020 --> 01:18:37,520
You're like the senior reporter.

1759
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,660
The one with the biggest flashlight.

1760
01:18:41,940 --> 01:18:42,600
You guys not hear him?

1761
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:43,860
I think he's behind us.

1762
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:44,620
Is he?

1763
01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:45,660
No?

1764
01:18:46,740 --> 01:18:49,900
I think we're hearing our own footsteps.

1765
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:51,700
No, no, no, no.

1766
01:18:51,820 --> 01:18:53,460
I'm hearing growls right now.

1767
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:54,780
I'm hearing growls.

1768
01:18:54,940 --> 01:18:56,340
I think he's underneath us.

1769
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:59,840
Under where?

1770
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:02,340
Hello?

1771
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:06,180
Monster?

1772
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:09,520
She is a monster.

1773
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:09,580
Monster?

1774
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:14,120
This photo is old.

1775
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:15,140
Pineapple?

1776
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:18,480
He's sucking on his fingers.

1777
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:22,320
The text is just literally pineapple?

1778
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:24,160
There's nothing in there.

1779
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:25,140
That is a dead end.

1780
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:29,140
Is it procedurally generated?

1781
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:30,800
There's lots of stupid dead ends.

1782
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:31,980
I think that's it.

1783
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:36,220
I mean, that's her replayability.

1784
01:19:40,860 --> 01:19:41,660
What is that?

1785
01:19:43,540 --> 01:19:44,640
Yeah, I saw that.

1786
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:45,680
I couldn't even see the photo.

1787
01:19:45,820 --> 01:19:46,400
I was like, what?

1788
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:47,340
And then it disappeared.

1789
01:19:48,980 --> 01:19:51,200
There's something in that room over there too.

1790
01:19:51,340 --> 01:19:52,340
Something just went past the camera.

1791
01:19:54,100 --> 01:19:55,180
Oh, I hear him.

1792
01:19:55,380 --> 01:19:56,500
That's fucking loud.

1793
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:00,980
No, I didn't get a picture.

1794
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:05,440
There's a door here if you want to go in.

1795
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:06,620
Hello?

1796
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:09,760
Oh, there's a little baby thing as well.

1797
01:20:09,820 --> 01:20:10,500
It's like a rat.

1798
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:11,420
I saw a rat.

1799
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:13,980
How do you see all these babies?

1800
01:20:14,180 --> 01:20:15,360
I've never seen the babies.

1801
01:20:16,140 --> 01:20:17,700
You don't want to go in the place where the rat is?

1802
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:18,340
We're going this way?

1803
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:18,580
Alright.

1804
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:19,900
I'm just following you.

1805
01:20:21,140 --> 01:20:22,140
I'm just following you.

1806
01:20:23,060 --> 01:20:25,840
There was another place though where there was a little baby rat thing.

1807
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:27,440
I think this leads there.

1808
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:29,100
I think this is the same place.

1809
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:30,020
Oh, there's a survivor.

1810
01:20:32,820 --> 01:20:35,160
No, he's just...

1811
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:37,140
He's just doing a little spin.

1812
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:42,480
Don't worry, follow us.

1813
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:43,640
We won't take you to die.

1814
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:47,780
I think this just goes around in a circle.

1815
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:48,340
Maybe?

1816
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:49,180
Pizza?

1817
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:52,500
There's another door here.

1818
01:20:55,240 --> 01:20:56,640
Oh, he is following us.

1819
01:20:57,580 --> 01:20:58,400
What an idiot.

1820
01:20:58,880 --> 01:20:59,700
Break room!

1821
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:01,760
Oh, what's going on in here?

1822
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:02,460
Nevermind.

1823
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:04,260
This goes back around to the start.

1824
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:05,840
Yeah, we're at the start again.

1825
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:07,700
This is where the monster was earlier.

1826
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:09,560
Can you fucking...

1827
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:10,160
Oh, he's right here!

1828
01:21:11,820 --> 01:21:13,420
If you want to open it...

1829
01:21:13,420 --> 01:21:14,620
Here, I'll pose.

1830
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:17,640
Isn't that the creature that took your leg out?

1831
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:20,060
Oh, there's the spinny Cthulhu!

1832
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:20,640
I got it!

1833
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:23,420
Did you get the photo?

1834
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:24,720
Yeah, I got it.

1835
01:21:24,820 --> 01:21:27,540
It looks like a D&D beholder.

1836
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:29,540
He's really right there.

1837
01:21:30,060 --> 01:21:31,640
Okay, we open the door.

1838
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:34,160
I take the photo and then we close the door.

1839
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:35,320
Okay.

1840
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:38,220
I'll put the light on it.

1841
01:21:38,380 --> 01:21:39,660
Here, tell me...

1842
01:21:39,660 --> 01:21:40,520
Oh, open the door.

1843
01:21:41,420 --> 01:21:42,580
She's got the pro camera.

1844
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:45,420
3, 2, 1...

1845
01:21:46,620 --> 01:21:47,200
Close the door!

1846
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:48,040
Close the door!

1847
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:50,640
For the love of God.

1848
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:51,480
I can't...

1849
01:21:52,460 --> 01:21:52,860
Okay.

1850
01:21:54,380 --> 01:21:55,160
Where is he?

1851
01:21:56,340 --> 01:21:57,200
I don't know where he went.

1852
01:21:58,220 --> 01:21:58,860
Yeah, just shut the door.

1853
01:21:59,260 --> 01:21:59,840
We should get the fuck out.

1854
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:03,400
Oh my God!

1855
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:06,400
I'm good.

1856
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:07,180
Don't worry about it.

1857
01:22:09,940 --> 01:22:10,960
Don't worry about him.

1858
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:12,080
Don't worry about him.

1859
01:22:13,020 --> 01:22:14,080
Don't worry about him.

1860
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:15,860
It's okay.

1861
01:22:16,060 --> 01:22:16,480
Are we leaving?

1862
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:17,400
I can't get out!

1863
01:22:19,940 --> 01:22:21,540
I'm so sad!

1864
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:22,520
What?

1865
01:22:26,220 --> 01:22:26,660
I'm

1866
01:22:42,140 --> 01:22:43,860
a little fucked.

1867
01:22:48,210 --> 01:22:49,030
Hey there.

1868
01:22:49,550 --> 01:22:50,790
It's just you and I.

1869
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:57,320
It's just you and I.

1870
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:03,040
It's just you and I.

1871
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:05,940
What do we do?

1872
01:23:05,940 --> 01:23:06,040
What do we do?

1873
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:21,560
I'm a little stuck right now.

1874
01:23:25,930 --> 01:23:27,330
Okay, I can get out of here.

1875
01:23:28,230 --> 01:23:29,850
I can make it!

1876
01:23:31,330 --> 01:23:31,870
Take a photo!

1877
01:23:32,110 --> 01:23:33,870
I ran out of photos!

1878
01:23:36,330 --> 01:23:37,690
I'm okay.

1879
01:23:47,850 --> 01:23:49,610
Is she okay?

1880
01:23:49,610 --> 01:23:49,650
Is she okay?

1881
01:23:58,280 --> 01:23:58,800
Parkour!

1882
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:02,620
Wait, where do I go?

1883
01:24:37,830 --> 01:24:38,970
I'm heading over!

1884
01:24:49,530 --> 01:24:50,430
Oh my God, I'm...

1885
01:24:51,550 --> 01:24:52,790
I'm almost there!

1886
01:24:54,010 --> 01:24:54,450
I'm here.

1887
01:24:54,750 --> 01:24:55,830
Wait, where's everybody else?

1888
01:24:58,190 --> 01:24:59,750
Wait, did everybody else die?

1889
01:25:03,820 --> 01:25:05,520
Oh, is she going for the camera?

1890
01:25:07,540 --> 01:25:08,680
Wait, where is she?

1891
01:25:10,180 --> 01:25:11,240
Where did she go?

1892
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:26,120
Oh my God.

1893
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:33,280
Oh my God, that was...

1894
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:33,900
You're crazy.

1895
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:36,260
You don't have an arm.

1896
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:37,700
No!

1897
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:39,700
What happened to you?

1898
01:25:40,620 --> 01:25:42,520
What happened to you?

1899
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:53,660
Dang it, that guy got me on the ladder.

1900
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:55,380
I was like, oh, I wonder if he'll be able to attack you.

1901
01:25:55,380 --> 01:25:57,560
Oh, I was wondering, because you were right behind me.

1902
01:25:57,940 --> 01:25:58,220
Yeah.

1903
01:25:58,340 --> 01:25:59,280
How did you die?

1904
01:26:00,940 --> 01:26:02,180
How did you die?

1905
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:03,700
I got eaten by a dog.

1906
01:26:03,940 --> 01:26:05,080
Oh, you got eaten by the dog.

1907
01:26:05,980 --> 01:26:08,720
Oh, the big guy got you on the ladder?

1908
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:09,340
That sucks.

1909
01:26:11,540 --> 01:26:12,780
Oh, there's your photo.

1910
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:17,780
Oh my God, that is a kudosa.

1911
01:26:17,780 --> 01:26:18,680
I'm eating my ass.

1912
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:20,560
Oh my God.

1913
01:26:21,100 --> 01:26:22,380
What the fuck?

1914
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:25,480
Damn, that one's so scary.

1915
01:26:25,580 --> 01:26:27,320
That's like a true apocalyptic...

1916
01:26:31,220 --> 01:26:34,160
When you chomp, you're the Darwin of war.

1917
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:36,700
Yeah, baby.

1918
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:38,540
Oh, yeah.

1919
01:26:38,900 --> 01:26:39,740
I still survived.

1920
01:26:40,060 --> 01:26:42,560
I survived that guy twice, and I survived the baby.

1921
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:44,560
I like this one, too.

1922
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:48,560
The rat just ran towards you and didn't even stop.

1923
01:26:48,660 --> 01:26:49,980
He just took your leg out.

1924
01:26:50,060 --> 01:26:52,040
Oh my God, I wish I saw...

1925
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:52,740
He smelled my blood.

1926
01:26:54,060 --> 01:26:57,060
I wish I could have shown you guys.

1927
01:26:57,420 --> 01:26:59,000
I wish it caught on camera.

1928
01:27:00,180 --> 01:27:02,800
You got a selfie with the big guy.

1929
01:27:02,940 --> 01:27:03,560
Oh my God, he did.

1930
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:05,520
Wait, did it even count?

1931
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:08,640
It didn't register as being with him, but it sucked.

1932
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:10,400
Oh, you got robbed.

1933
01:27:10,740 --> 01:27:11,420
I did.

1934
01:27:11,420 --> 01:27:16,300
This was supposed to be a photo with the rat right through you, but you were so fast.

1935
01:27:16,300 --> 01:27:18,020
This was the rat mowing you down.

1936
01:27:18,240 --> 01:27:21,340
And it was so fast, I didn't capture the moment.

1937
01:27:24,260 --> 01:27:26,220
I look like I'm really angry.

1938
01:27:27,700 --> 01:27:30,080
Are you sure I should do that?

1939
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:31,920
I love this photo.

1940
01:27:34,260 --> 01:27:37,260
This is when I was peeping into people's houses.

1941
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:40,140
Oh, you really did take a photo.

1942
01:27:40,460 --> 01:27:42,440
Alright, your turn with the pro camera.

1943
01:27:43,340 --> 01:27:45,340
Oh God, I don't know if I can handle this responsibility.

1944
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:46,340
It's your turn.

1945
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:47,440
Give me the flashlight if you want.

1946
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:48,360
Yeah, take the flashlight.

1947
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:49,180
Alright.

1948
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:54,380
Another day on the job.

1949
01:27:56,700 --> 01:27:58,320
Do we have a standard flashlight?

1950
01:27:58,480 --> 01:27:59,480
I do, I do.

1951
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:00,300
I have one.

1952
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:01,580
Let's go.

1953
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:03,920
I didn't have one before.

1954
01:28:04,820 --> 01:28:06,480
You did, I didn't get it though.

1955
01:28:06,620 --> 01:28:07,600
I was too busy getting your camera.

1956
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:16,920
Don't worry, we're all professionals here.

1957
01:28:20,020 --> 01:28:23,900
I knew my journalism degree would come in handy.

1958
01:28:25,220 --> 01:28:26,980
I don't have a journalism degree.

1959
01:28:31,740 --> 01:28:33,580
Who is reading this newspaper?

1960
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:35,500
Who's still alive to be reading this?

1961
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:37,080
I wonder what the blue light means.

1962
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:39,820
I feel like it has to be important, but it hasn't told us anything about it yet.

1963
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:43,200
Well, I feel like now that the internet is down and everything, you know, this is like literally...

1964
01:28:44,820 --> 01:28:47,340
literally like the only thing to read now.

1965
01:28:48,380 --> 01:28:48,980
Oh, true.

1966
01:28:49,220 --> 01:28:54,440
I feel like, yeah, I'm pretty sure these monsters have taken down all of the internet.

1967
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:56,840
The 5G's.

1968
01:28:57,820 --> 01:28:58,620
The 5G?

1969
01:28:58,660 --> 01:29:00,920
The 5G rays that's turning the frogs gay.

1970
01:29:00,940 --> 01:29:04,620
Even if the world ends, even if the world ends, we still got you covered.

1971
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:05,880
BS insurance.

1972
01:29:06,740 --> 01:29:08,040
We are professionals.

1973
01:29:10,540 --> 01:29:11,400
Which way do you want to go?

1974
01:29:11,460 --> 01:29:12,420
There's a building behind us.

1975
01:29:12,540 --> 01:29:13,560
Oh, we didn't go to that building.

1976
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:17,860
Mint and I went in there very briefly, but not long enough, so we can go look.

1977
01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:19,300
Yeah, let's look in there.

1978
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:23,460
No, I think it's all like randomly generated.

1979
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:24,180
Yeah.

1980
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:25,560
Don't go crypto.

1981
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:29,400
Well, this is different.

1982
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:30,340
Uh oh.

1983
01:29:30,820 --> 01:29:31,720
Wanna get rich?

1984
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:33,300
Sure.

1985
01:29:34,140 --> 01:29:34,560
Hello.

1986
01:29:36,780 --> 01:29:38,520
We're here to get rich.

1987
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:48,680
I ain't scared.

1988
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:56,020
I ain't scared.

1989
01:29:56,020 --> 01:29:57,820
It's really dark in here.

1990
01:29:57,880 --> 01:29:58,840
Oh, hey, there's CCTV.

1991
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:04,500
I wonder if it ever actually shows anything useful.

1992
01:30:05,020 --> 01:30:05,640
I don't think so.

1993
01:30:05,740 --> 01:30:06,820
Hello, intercom.

1994
01:30:07,100 --> 01:30:07,340
Hello.

1995
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:11,680
It's scary not having the flashlight, actually.

1996
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:12,900
I know, it is.

1997
01:30:13,020 --> 01:30:14,280
I don't think there's anything else in here.

1998
01:30:14,740 --> 01:30:16,040
There are no more doors here?

1999
01:30:16,460 --> 01:30:18,060
There's a door across from us over there.

2000
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:18,800
Oh yeah, let's go over there, yeah.

2001
01:30:24,690 --> 01:30:25,050
Ooh.

2002
01:30:25,350 --> 01:30:25,630
Hello?

2003
01:30:25,630 --> 01:30:25,890
Hello?

2004
01:30:29,060 --> 01:30:29,840
Oh, we're in the news station.

2005
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:33,480
Channel 5 News here to report on these alien sightings.

2006
01:30:35,820 --> 01:30:38,060
I guess this is another news station.

2007
01:30:39,320 --> 01:30:40,680
Oh, oh, what's that?

2008
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:42,080
That's me.

2009
01:30:42,300 --> 01:30:43,820
Uh oh, wait, what's that sound?

2010
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:46,820
Oh, someone creepy's here.

2011
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:47,480
Baby!

2012
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:50,640
I got him, I got him!

2013
01:30:50,740 --> 01:30:51,980
I got the baby, I got the baby!

2014
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:54,100
Let me fuckin' squeeble.

2015
01:30:54,100 --> 01:30:55,640
I got a little squeeble.

2016
01:30:55,720 --> 01:30:56,720
Who would pose next to it?

2017
01:31:01,150 --> 01:31:03,470
He's apparently chasing us, so we might wanna be...

2018
01:31:05,370 --> 01:31:07,070
Oh god, oh god, I'm running, I'm running.

2019
01:31:11,110 --> 01:31:13,610
That's right, can't get my legs if I'm on high ground.

2020
01:31:18,110 --> 01:31:19,670
I'm jumpin', I'm jumpin' down.

2021
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:24,920
Hey, you guys good?

2022
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:26,060
Yeah!

2023
01:31:26,060 --> 01:31:27,540
Yeah, he can't get me.

2024
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:31,620
Yeah, he can't get me.

2025
01:31:31,660 --> 01:31:33,360
I'mma have the high ground now.

2026
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:38,880
Yeah,

2027
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:44,460
we have all the good photos.

2028
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:47,280
Wait, there's something over there, do you see that?

2029
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:51,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2030
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:52,240
Yeah, I'll take a picture of that.

2031
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:53,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2032
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:54,980
I'll pose next to it.

2033
01:32:03,300 --> 01:32:04,240
Yeah,

2034
01:32:07,780 --> 01:32:09,760
we're just chillin'.

2035
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:10,840
We're just chill, guys.

2036
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:25,440
Was it the baby?

2037
01:32:26,140 --> 01:32:26,940
Was it a squeaker?

2038
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:30,080
I don't think it was a squeaker.

2039
01:32:30,780 --> 01:32:31,520
Oh shit!

2040
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:33,020
We opened the door.

2041
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:34,520
Oh yeah, we got that.

2042
01:32:35,220 --> 01:32:36,500
Oh, there's a dead guy there too.

2043
01:32:37,200 --> 01:32:38,800
Uh oh, I hear him, I hear him.

2044
01:32:40,360 --> 01:32:41,620
I hear him walking.

2045
01:32:42,420 --> 01:32:44,400
There's enough room for three people up here, Lyon.

2046
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:46,360
Oh, there's something on the stairwell up there.

2047
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:48,240
Oh, they're all up here.

2048
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:49,820
Through that door over there, yeah.

2049
01:32:50,380 --> 01:32:51,200
There are camping guys!

2050
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:53,280
This is New York, look, this is New York.

2051
01:32:53,300 --> 01:32:53,900
We should skedaddle.

2052
01:32:54,280 --> 01:32:55,820
We should really leave.

2053
01:32:56,020 --> 01:32:56,980
How do we get out?

2054
01:32:57,820 --> 01:32:59,100
Oh, let's go up the stairway here.

2055
01:32:59,720 --> 01:33:00,900
Aren't they camping?

2056
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:02,420
No, through the door.

2057
01:33:05,260 --> 01:33:08,060
I think to get out, we go back this way?

2058
01:33:09,260 --> 01:33:10,300
We come from here?

2059
01:33:10,540 --> 01:33:11,220
This looks right.

2060
01:33:11,860 --> 01:33:13,240
Cause we closed all the doors.

2061
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:15,620
And there was a lantern.

2062
01:33:16,020 --> 01:33:17,160
Yeah, yeah, and then up here.

2063
01:33:17,160 --> 01:33:17,980
Uh-huh.

2064
01:33:20,180 --> 01:33:20,580
See?

2065
01:33:21,100 --> 01:33:24,560
I would never lead you astray with my horrific sense of direction.

2066
01:33:25,700 --> 01:33:27,400
Wait, this is the exit over here.

2067
01:33:27,540 --> 01:33:27,900
Yeah, okay.

2068
01:33:28,100 --> 01:33:28,600
This way, yeah.

2069
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:30,600
Do we want to leave?

2070
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:32,980
I think we might.

2071
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:35,020
What is that?

2072
01:33:36,020 --> 01:33:38,060
I don't know, do you want a photo of it before we go?

2073
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:40,140
Yeah, sure, last photo before we go.

2074
01:33:40,280 --> 01:33:41,540
It's kinda stompy.

2075
01:33:41,900 --> 01:33:43,620
Yeah, I was gonna say, it's big, it's a big boy.

2076
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:44,760
Oh, there it is!

2077
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:46,080
It's a stalker!

2078
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:47,020
Stalker, no stalking!

2079
01:33:47,240 --> 01:33:48,220
Oh wait, his name is Shamble.

2080
01:33:49,380 --> 01:33:51,080
Oh, I missed it.

2081
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:53,040
Oh, two posts, two posts next to him.

2082
01:33:54,260 --> 01:33:55,280
Uh, I'm out of photos.

2083
01:33:56,820 --> 01:33:57,380
Eh, running.

2084
01:33:59,080 --> 01:33:59,800
Go, go, go, go!

2085
01:34:04,060 --> 01:34:05,000
Oh my god!

2086
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:09,820
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!

2087
01:34:21,360 --> 01:34:22,920
There's a dog right next to you, you're gonna die.

2088
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:23,160
Oh!

2089
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,060
Oh, oh, oh!

2090
01:34:42,240 --> 01:34:43,260
Something ran underneath me.

2091
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:44,120
Oh my god!

2092
01:34:44,620 --> 01:34:45,240
Big

2093
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:53,300
guy coming through.

2094
01:34:54,280 --> 01:34:55,380
Everyone get out!

2095
01:34:59,990 --> 01:35:01,330
I swear, you guys have to get this camera.

2096
01:35:01,450 --> 01:35:02,950
I would run it very far away.

2097
01:35:03,390 --> 01:35:05,250
When I die with this camera.

2098
01:35:08,630 --> 01:35:10,750
I think she's dead.

2099
01:35:11,330 --> 01:35:13,030
I think she's dead.

2100
01:35:13,210 --> 01:35:14,310
She's right here.

2101
01:35:15,070 --> 01:35:17,870
Your body- Oh wait, no, these are military bodies.

2102
01:35:22,610 --> 01:35:25,770
I might die, I might die, I-

2103
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:32,660
Don't come here.

2104
01:35:33,100 --> 01:35:34,360
Don't come this way.

2105
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:36,380
Don't come this way.

2106
01:35:41,370 --> 01:35:42,930
Don't come this way.

2107
01:35:45,910 --> 01:35:48,290
I don't know where her body is, but I'm running.

2108
01:35:50,670 --> 01:35:51,630
I'm leaving.

2109
01:35:55,010 --> 01:35:56,750
Wait, is she dead?

2110
01:35:58,410 --> 01:35:59,630
Wait, where did Lime go?

2111
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:06,560
Oh!

2112
01:36:28,180 --> 01:36:31,080
I was like, did Lime die?

2113
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:38,160
I didn't know she died!

2114
01:36:39,820 --> 01:36:42,600
Okay, I'll just get in the plane first and wait for it.

2115
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:46,100
There's my photo, there's a photo of you.

2116
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:49,020
These are gonna be the only photos we have because we died.

2117
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:57,960
There's the beautiful cab, and then there's the stalker, and then wow, the baby right there.

2118
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:00,740
And then, look at that.

2119
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:04,480
All me, guys.

2120
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:07,880
Oh, and I took us to the next level.

2121
01:37:08,160 --> 01:37:09,660
You're welcome, everybody.

2122
01:37:10,780 --> 01:37:11,940
Look at that.

2123
01:37:12,060 --> 01:37:13,480
My beautiful photo.

2124
01:37:16,740 --> 01:37:20,680
My beautiful photo in the front page.

2125
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:21,580
Yet again.

2126
01:37:22,680 --> 01:37:23,540
Look at that.

2127
01:37:25,980 --> 01:37:26,700
MVP.

2128
01:37:27,700 --> 01:37:29,600
We need a pro camera.

2129
01:37:30,660 --> 01:37:30,900
Okay.

2130
01:37:30,900 --> 01:37:31,020
Okay.

2131
01:37:32,260 --> 01:37:34,420
We could also do like a...

2132
01:37:34,420 --> 01:37:35,780
We could each have pro cameras.

2133
01:37:36,260 --> 01:37:36,940
Oh, that's true.

2134
01:37:37,540 --> 01:37:41,100
But that does lower the amount of total photos we can take because it could only hold seven.

2135
01:37:41,460 --> 01:37:41,860
Oh.

2136
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:45,240
Yeah, that's like the disadvantage.

2137
01:37:45,560 --> 01:37:48,940
We could get like sports shoes so we could run faster.

2138
01:37:50,100 --> 01:37:51,040
We could get more health too.

2139
01:37:51,100 --> 01:37:57,060
We could get a pair of sports shoes and then we could also maybe get a flashy camera because that's like a good middle ground.

2140
01:37:57,060 --> 01:37:58,020
Oh, that's true.

2141
01:37:58,140 --> 01:37:58,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2142
01:38:00,140 --> 01:38:04,560
Okay, so let's do sports shoes and a flashy camera.

2143
01:38:05,560 --> 01:38:06,660
I can't believe I lived there.

2144
01:38:06,740 --> 01:38:09,240
That monster killed all the military men and I lived.

2145
01:38:09,720 --> 01:38:12,280
I watched it and I was like oh, she's dead for sure.

2146
01:38:12,300 --> 01:38:13,360
Yeah, I thought I was dead.

2147
01:38:13,380 --> 01:38:15,040
I wasn't looking at my screen anymore.

2148
01:38:15,140 --> 01:38:15,920
I was like goodbye.

2149
01:38:16,520 --> 01:38:17,880
Alright, who wants the shoes?

2150
01:38:17,960 --> 01:38:18,700
Who wants the camera?

2151
01:38:18,900 --> 01:38:20,740
Don't let Doki take the... Okay, nevermind.

2152
01:38:22,540 --> 01:38:25,460
He's just gonna use it to run away You cannot do it.

2153
01:38:26,180 --> 01:38:30,100
I think Lime should do it because she's been the camera picker up here.

2154
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:30,900
Alright.

2155
01:38:31,380 --> 01:38:32,640
Sick kicks, we're going.

2156
01:38:35,660 --> 01:38:37,900
Okay, I'll get it.

2157
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:43,660
You'll also have to like, you know, we don't have a flashlight because I mismanaged our money so let's go.

2158
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:44,780
I have a flashlight here.

2159
01:38:44,940 --> 01:38:46,060
Oh, you have a flashlight?

2160
01:38:46,240 --> 01:38:46,360
Fantastic.

2161
01:38:46,360 --> 01:38:48,180
Someone else use it, not me.

2162
01:38:48,360 --> 01:38:49,100
I got it, I got it.

2163
01:38:49,200 --> 01:38:49,920
We're good, we're good.

2164
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:50,740
Alright, let's go.

2165
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:52,300
We should be in...

2166
01:38:52,300 --> 01:38:56,640
Yeah, we're in crime level 3 now, I'm pretty sure.

2167
01:38:58,120 --> 01:38:59,420
Monster crime.

2168
01:38:59,860 --> 01:39:00,080
Yeah.

2169
01:39:04,530 --> 01:39:05,990
Those monsters.

2170
01:39:06,750 --> 01:39:07,670
God damn it.

2171
01:39:08,690 --> 01:39:15,270
Ever since that monster became mayor prime levels have risen.

2172
01:39:15,270 --> 01:39:16,150
Those monsters ruined the neighborhood.

2173
01:39:16,370 --> 01:39:18,810
Yeah, these monsters ruined the neighborhood.

2174
01:39:21,570 --> 01:39:22,290
I got him.

2175
01:39:22,290 --> 01:39:24,410
Yeah, it's got an inbuilt flash.

2176
01:39:24,690 --> 01:39:26,090
Medicines, all of them.

2177
01:39:28,790 --> 01:39:30,690
They're not, they're monsters!

2178
01:39:33,430 --> 01:39:35,410
We're like the people in Townsville.

2179
01:39:36,610 --> 01:39:40,990
Isn't like people in Townsville like hate monsters and don't want to integrate?

2180
01:39:41,910 --> 01:39:43,910
The city of Townsville.

2181
01:39:45,430 --> 01:39:46,190
That's right.

2182
01:39:46,250 --> 01:39:48,150
They don't deserve to work in our city.

2183
01:39:49,550 --> 01:39:51,450
Oh, there's a building over to the right here.

2184
01:39:51,570 --> 01:39:52,990
On the left.

2185
01:39:53,390 --> 01:39:56,230
Do you want to go to the city mall or whatever that building is?

2186
01:39:57,150 --> 01:39:57,990
Don't think it matters.

2187
01:39:58,270 --> 01:40:00,690
I feel like this one's closer, just a little bit.

2188
01:40:01,070 --> 01:40:04,170
Yeah, but it's the same, we've been here before.

2189
01:40:07,090 --> 01:40:08,170
Yeah, it's the international.

2190
01:40:08,970 --> 01:40:09,090
Yeah, yeah.

2191
01:40:10,390 --> 01:40:11,750
Why don't we get access to the elevator?

2192
01:40:13,090 --> 01:40:14,310
Oh, I hear growling.

2193
01:40:14,310 --> 01:40:15,610
Oh, there's a dude just hiding over there.

2194
01:40:16,110 --> 01:40:17,210
Oh, nevermind, that's a man.

2195
01:40:17,210 --> 01:40:17,790
Help!

2196
01:40:21,340 --> 01:40:22,940
Someone, someone, did someone...

2197
01:40:22,940 --> 01:40:23,300
I got you.

2198
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:25,240
I got a photo, don't worry, I got the photo.

2199
01:40:25,940 --> 01:40:27,020
Oh, it's the fucking baby.

2200
01:40:27,220 --> 01:40:27,780
That bitch.

2201
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:30,000
What's he doing?

2202
01:40:30,900 --> 01:40:31,260
Baby!

2203
01:40:32,840 --> 01:40:33,200
Baby!

2204
01:40:33,680 --> 01:40:34,940
Hey, get out of my shot, man.

2205
01:40:36,460 --> 01:40:37,420
I mean, he can't see points.

2206
01:40:38,260 --> 01:40:38,920
Alright, I...

2207
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:40,820
Don't worry, I'm okay, guys, if you were wondering.

2208
01:40:42,100 --> 01:40:42,980
Yeah, we're all great.

2209
01:40:43,500 --> 01:40:45,060
Was that the baby that got me?

2210
01:40:45,120 --> 01:40:46,000
I didn't even see him.

2211
01:40:46,200 --> 01:40:46,600
I don't know.

2212
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:47,700
It was a trap.

2213
01:40:47,820 --> 01:40:48,840
Oh, baby!

2214
01:40:50,500 --> 01:40:52,260
Oh my god, he just ran.

2215
01:40:52,820 --> 01:40:55,560
How is there so many monsters right off the bat?

2216
01:40:56,080 --> 01:40:56,420
I know.

2217
01:40:56,420 --> 01:40:57,940
Kids were on three stars.

2218
01:40:58,780 --> 01:40:59,220
Hello, babies.

2219
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:01,220
Wait, Poe's next to the baby.

2220
01:41:01,940 --> 01:41:03,100
Oh, nevermind, he ran away.

2221
01:41:03,580 --> 01:41:04,060
Goodbye, baby.

2222
01:41:05,180 --> 01:41:06,400
Goodbye, little man.

2223
01:41:08,100 --> 01:41:09,840
I vote we don't just chase the baby.

2224
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:10,720
Nah.

2225
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:12,580
Oh, shit!

2226
01:41:12,580 --> 01:41:12,640
Oh, shit!

2227
01:41:14,100 --> 01:41:14,780
What is it?

2228
01:41:15,020 --> 01:41:15,420
Baby!

2229
01:41:15,940 --> 01:41:16,120
Baby!

2230
01:41:19,300 --> 01:41:19,700
Where?

2231
01:41:19,880 --> 01:41:20,740
What did you see?

2232
01:41:21,300 --> 01:41:22,100
It was a stalker.

2233
01:41:22,180 --> 01:41:26,960
Remember the stalker that came up to you and went, Oh.

2234
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:33,080
I think he might be like that guy in Lethal Company where you have to see him in order for him not to murder you.

2235
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:35,000
Like, you know, you catch him and then...

2236
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:35,160
Yeah.

2237
01:41:35,580 --> 01:41:35,780
Oh!

2238
01:41:38,360 --> 01:41:39,900
It was a stalker again.

2239
01:41:40,920 --> 01:41:42,880
What's going on in there?

2240
01:41:42,980 --> 01:41:43,540
Squishy noises.

2241
01:41:44,300 --> 01:41:46,300
We should photograph those squishy noises.

2242
01:41:46,820 --> 01:41:47,300
Hello.

2243
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:51,700
If you feel close to the thing, always emote.

2244
01:41:51,780 --> 01:41:52,340
Just press it.

2245
01:41:53,180 --> 01:41:54,520
Just remember to emote.

2246
01:41:54,700 --> 01:41:56,700
Oh, the baby killed him!

2247
01:41:56,820 --> 01:41:57,680
What the fuck?

2248
01:41:57,800 --> 01:41:58,800
What the fuck?

2249
01:41:59,120 --> 01:42:00,560
I'm now terrified of the baby.

2250
01:42:01,760 --> 01:42:02,480
Oh, God.

2251
01:42:02,840 --> 01:42:05,960
What the fuck?

2252
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:08,280
The baby is afraid of light, I think.

2253
01:42:08,280 --> 01:42:09,040
What the fuck?

2254
01:42:09,340 --> 01:42:10,620
Oh, my God!

2255
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:11,720
The perfect photo!

2256
01:42:11,720 --> 01:42:14,260
The baby killed the fucking stalker, though.

2257
01:42:14,280 --> 01:42:15,020
Yeah, the baby...

2258
01:42:20,480 --> 01:42:22,180
The baby is awesome!

2259
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:23,160
Thanks, baby!

2260
01:42:24,140 --> 01:42:26,020
He's just standing there.

2261
01:42:29,200 --> 01:42:30,420
Oh, I can move this.

2262
01:42:31,080 --> 01:42:31,460
Oh, damn.

2263
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:32,060
We can take it.

2264
01:42:32,440 --> 01:42:34,140
Oh, we can take it for a better photo.

2265
01:42:34,860 --> 01:42:35,200
Ugh.

2266
01:42:36,280 --> 01:42:37,500
Oh, he's so...

2267
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:40,780
Okay, he doesn't stop, like, squishing once you pick him up.

2268
01:42:41,180 --> 01:42:42,460
Oh, there's a goop here.

2269
01:42:43,620 --> 01:42:43,800
Oh.

2270
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:46,840
I don't want to step on that, personally.

2271
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:49,180
Put him on it.

2272
01:42:50,300 --> 01:42:50,780
No.

2273
01:42:52,140 --> 01:42:53,960
Why are you following us, dude?

2274
01:42:54,980 --> 01:42:57,500
You have, like, no self-preservation instincts whatsoever.

2275
01:42:57,700 --> 01:42:58,480
Maybe he can step through it.

2276
01:42:58,560 --> 01:42:59,680
Are we just parkour here?

2277
01:43:01,020 --> 01:43:01,520
Oh, true.

2278
01:43:02,260 --> 01:43:02,700
YOLO.

2279
01:43:04,380 --> 01:43:05,000
I fell down.

2280
01:43:07,560 --> 01:43:11,200
So, I think the baby might get real scary if you don't have any light.

2281
01:43:11,740 --> 01:43:12,120
Yeah.

2282
01:43:13,180 --> 01:43:15,600
Cause the baby just fucking brutalized that thing.

2283
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:17,280
Yeah, that...

2284
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:21,060
I thought he was just a real man, but, like, he is a big boy.

2285
01:43:24,040 --> 01:43:25,240
Oh, the holder.

2286
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:27,160
Uh-oh, what was that?

2287
01:43:27,980 --> 01:43:29,080
It's him, right there.

2288
01:43:30,020 --> 01:43:30,760
Hey, there.

2289
01:43:32,380 --> 01:43:32,840
He's chilling.

2290
01:43:33,140 --> 01:43:33,660
He's just chilling.

2291
01:43:33,960 --> 01:43:35,080
Oh, he's gonna vibrate?

2292
01:43:36,820 --> 01:43:37,220
Bye.

2293
01:43:39,660 --> 01:43:40,840
He's like, peace out.

2294
01:43:41,740 --> 01:43:42,960
He does a spin.

2295
01:43:43,140 --> 01:43:43,820
That's what he does.

2296
01:43:44,680 --> 01:43:46,000
He's just there for the vibe.

2297
01:43:47,220 --> 01:43:48,620
Where do we go now, after this?

2298
01:43:48,980 --> 01:43:50,480
He's still following us.

2299
01:43:50,980 --> 01:43:51,420
I know.

2300
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:52,400
Are you okay, man?

2301
01:43:54,020 --> 01:43:56,840
I think he's gonna follow us until we, like, get out of the house.

2302
01:43:59,080 --> 01:43:59,720
The house.

2303
01:44:00,180 --> 01:44:01,540
I'd hate for this to be my house.

2304
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:03,800
Yeah, my big-ass house right here.

2305
01:44:05,740 --> 01:44:06,980
Oh, Jesus.

2306
01:44:07,200 --> 01:44:07,780
Hello again.

2307
01:44:08,500 --> 01:44:09,260
Who was that?

2308
01:44:10,180 --> 01:44:11,520
It was the boy.

2309
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:12,640
Oh, it's him again.

2310
01:44:13,460 --> 01:44:14,580
Yeah, he's just chilling.

2311
01:44:15,100 --> 01:44:16,840
I don't really understand his bit.

2312
01:44:18,740 --> 01:44:19,960
Oh, what is that?

2313
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:21,540
It's him again, isn't it?

2314
01:44:21,580 --> 01:44:22,320
That's the same sound.

2315
01:44:22,380 --> 01:44:23,440
It sounds like him, yeah.

2316
01:44:23,960 --> 01:44:24,280
Yeah.

2317
01:44:27,220 --> 01:44:28,100
Whoa, baby.

2318
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:29,240
Meow.

2319
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:31,160
Meow.

2320
01:44:33,320 --> 01:44:37,020
Oh, this leads to the main entrance.

2321
01:44:37,540 --> 01:44:37,960
Oh, does it?

2322
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:38,780
Oh, we should go back.

2323
01:44:39,700 --> 01:44:42,980
I think it should be enough time for a big guy to show up.

2324
01:44:42,980 --> 01:44:44,080
Oh, yeah, this is where that dude died.

2325
01:44:46,260 --> 01:44:46,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2326
01:44:46,820 --> 01:44:47,640
We should go back there.

2327
01:44:48,500 --> 01:44:49,840
We're going in a circle now.

2328
01:44:50,500 --> 01:44:51,480
Yeah, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

2329
01:44:51,480 --> 01:44:52,020
Hello.

2330
01:44:54,860 --> 01:44:55,360
Hello.

2331
01:44:56,260 --> 01:44:56,400
Hello.

2332
01:44:57,720 --> 01:44:58,860
We didn't go this way.

2333
01:44:59,240 --> 01:45:04,080
It seems like he killed the other thing, so...

2334
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:05,560
Yeah, there's not a whole lot in here anymore.

2335
01:45:05,800 --> 01:45:08,260
Yeah, I feel like it's just a baby now.

2336
01:45:08,840 --> 01:45:10,160
Just one whole baby.

2337
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:12,980
Oh, he's here.

2338
01:45:13,540 --> 01:45:14,840
And he's out, yep.

2339
01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:17,120
Oh, wait, what the fuck?

2340
01:45:20,100 --> 01:45:20,500
Oh.

2341
01:45:20,500 --> 01:45:21,040
Wait, I'll do a pose.

2342
01:45:21,940 --> 01:45:22,900
Oh, there's a mini man.

2343
01:45:22,980 --> 01:45:23,700
There's a mini man.

2344
01:45:36,620 --> 01:45:38,040
Please, if I die, take my photo.

2345
01:45:38,160 --> 01:45:39,260
If I die, take my picture!

2346
01:45:45,800 --> 01:45:46,600
I'm safe.

2347
01:45:47,640 --> 01:45:49,500
Oh, I don't think I'm safe.

2348
01:45:50,420 --> 01:45:52,740
Oh, I don't think I'm safe.

2349
01:45:53,480 --> 01:45:53,740
Oh!

2350
01:45:54,820 --> 01:45:56,480
Please turn around, sir.

2351
01:45:57,260 --> 01:45:57,860
Turn around!

2352
01:45:57,980 --> 01:46:02,100
Running, running, running, running, running, running, running, Winning, winning, winning, winning, winning, winning, winning, winning...

2353
01:46:02,100 --> 01:46:03,000
The men make it!

2354
01:46:03,300 --> 01:46:03,800
Oh no!

2355
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:09,740
There was the equivalent of a trapdoor spider popped out of a fucking...

2356
01:46:14,740 --> 01:46:15,840
Oh my god.

2357
01:46:16,220 --> 01:46:17,880
You guys didn't get my camera!

2358
01:46:18,360 --> 01:46:19,460
I know I didn't get your camera!

2359
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:20,560
Oh you did?

2360
01:46:21,260 --> 01:46:21,780
Okay...

2361
01:46:21,780 --> 01:46:23,380
That's what her shoes are for!

2362
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:23,940
That's why!

2363
01:46:24,260 --> 01:46:24,260
That was amazing!

2364
01:46:24,440 --> 01:46:28,200
I saw that manhole cover moving and I was like, Oh, that's weird.

2365
01:46:28,300 --> 01:46:30,100
Then you went over there and got the fork.

2366
01:46:30,200 --> 01:46:31,360
I didn't even see!

2367
01:46:31,480 --> 01:46:32,780
I was like, what killed me?

2368
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:33,820
Nothing was around!

2369
01:46:34,280 --> 01:46:35,200
I took a picture of it.

2370
01:46:35,220 --> 01:46:36,240
You'll see it in a second.

2371
01:46:36,400 --> 01:46:36,700
Oh, no.

2372
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:38,580
Yes, I know exactly what you're talking about.

2373
01:46:38,660 --> 01:46:40,260
I saw it pop up, too.

2374
01:46:43,420 --> 01:46:44,180
Yeah, that's the photo.

2375
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:47,160
That.

2376
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:51,480
That guy.

2377
01:46:51,480 --> 01:46:52,620
Yeah, I saw that.

2378
01:46:55,460 --> 01:46:56,300
What on earth?

2379
01:46:56,440 --> 01:46:57,480
I didn't even see that guy.

2380
01:46:57,480 --> 01:46:58,140
That's me!

2381
01:46:58,320 --> 01:46:59,380
Would you see him?

2382
01:46:59,680 --> 01:47:01,200
That was the biggest monster!

2383
01:47:03,300 --> 01:47:05,380
That was the biggest monster!

2384
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:06,380
What do you mean?

2385
01:47:10,320 --> 01:47:11,080
Alright, my...

2386
01:47:11,080 --> 01:47:12,780
Your camera should be back on the desk.

2387
01:47:13,100 --> 01:47:14,940
My favorite photo has to be this one.

2388
01:47:15,040 --> 01:47:16,300
Oh, is it permanent?

2389
01:47:17,200 --> 01:47:18,740
No, it's because I picked it up for you.

2390
01:47:19,120 --> 01:47:19,260
Oh, that's right.

2391
01:47:19,260 --> 01:47:20,260
It just returns it to the desk.

2392
01:47:20,260 --> 01:47:21,140
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.

2393
01:47:23,240 --> 01:47:26,280
Oh, yeah, here's when you were getting trapped, by the way.

2394
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:28,440
Oh, yeah, that's what it looked like.

2395
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:30,480
Yeah, yeah, you were like, what's going on?

2396
01:47:33,040 --> 01:47:34,860
I like how he got six shoes on as well.

2397
01:47:34,880 --> 01:47:38,640
It looks like that fucking Fortnite thing where you can change your six shoes no matter who you are now.

2398
01:47:38,920 --> 01:47:39,820
It looks like that.

2399
01:47:43,760 --> 01:47:45,020
And there's the baby.

2400
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:49,640
I thought that thing was gonna pop back out of the manhole and eat me when I tried to get your camera.

2401
01:47:50,380 --> 01:47:54,860
Oh my god, I didn't realize there were like fucking traps too in the manhole.

2402
01:47:54,980 --> 01:47:55,800
That's crazy.

2403
01:47:55,900 --> 01:47:56,960
I didn't either.

2404
01:47:57,480 --> 01:47:58,460
That's so evil.

2405
01:47:58,540 --> 01:47:59,620
That's where you died.

2406
01:48:00,620 --> 01:48:01,360
I know.

2407
01:48:03,100 --> 01:48:06,140
Man, I thought it was the military guys shot me or something.

2408
01:48:06,460 --> 01:48:08,880
Oh, no, no, the bullets go through you.

2409
01:48:09,800 --> 01:48:10,140
They do?

2410
01:48:10,300 --> 01:48:11,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got shot.

2411
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:13,900
Like, they shot me, but I was like, I lived.

2412
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:18,420
It would be kind of harsh if you got friendly fired by those dudes on top of everything else.

2413
01:48:18,420 --> 01:48:18,760
I know!

2414
01:48:19,100 --> 01:48:22,080
Yeah, yeah, I was gonna say that would be pretty fucking rough.

2415
01:48:23,020 --> 01:48:25,600
Wait, you didn't see that giant tree monster?

2416
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:30,400
No, I was legitimately like trying to deal with someone that was throwing cars at me.

2417
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:37,280
That's crazy.

2418
01:48:37,480 --> 01:48:39,700
You were just like, we just gotta run.

2419
01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:42,460
You still have the flashlight, right?

2420
01:48:42,580 --> 01:48:42,940
Oh, you do?

2421
01:48:44,700 --> 01:48:45,800
Yeah, we got a flashlight.

2422
01:48:46,040 --> 01:48:47,560
Okay, I wanna go to a different house.

2423
01:48:47,680 --> 01:48:49,920
I feel like we've explored that a lot already.

2424
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:53,800
There was one on the right, but it seems as though the insides are just randomized.

2425
01:48:55,420 --> 01:48:56,100
I think so.

2426
01:48:56,220 --> 01:48:57,320
Wait, is there anything over here?

2427
01:48:58,880 --> 01:49:00,120
There's like a little alleyway.

2428
01:49:01,200 --> 01:49:05,480
You could also go up, but I don't think you can get onto the building.

2429
01:49:06,040 --> 01:49:06,340
I'm not sure.

2430
01:49:06,340 --> 01:49:09,200
I feel like it's just the Rutov, like, perspective POV.

2431
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:10,940
Yeah, can we get inside?

2432
01:49:11,060 --> 01:49:12,900
I assume not, but...

2433
01:49:12,900 --> 01:49:15,640
This feels like it's, like, lit up for me to go into, but no.

2434
01:49:17,160 --> 01:49:19,240
There's, like, weird lighting everywhere, too.

2435
01:49:19,360 --> 01:49:20,640
Like, this yellow lighting here.

2436
01:49:20,820 --> 01:49:25,240
Game design rules tell me I should be able to get inside that hut, but they lied to me.

2437
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,340
Wait, I think we just went in a circle a little bit.

2438
01:49:28,360 --> 01:49:28,920
Yeah, we did.

2439
01:49:29,140 --> 01:49:30,620
We went to the alleyway.

2440
01:49:31,640 --> 01:49:33,840
We don't wanna go to Sushi Kyoto!

2441
01:49:35,240 --> 01:49:36,500
Why can't we go there?

2442
01:49:36,860 --> 01:49:38,400
Oh, there's somebody in there.

2443
01:49:39,100 --> 01:49:41,040
Oh, yeah, they won't let us in Sushi Kyoto.

2444
01:49:41,580 --> 01:49:43,020
He's like, no, this is my Sushi Kyoto.

2445
01:49:43,020 --> 01:49:45,400
Wait, there's another house over there we haven't gone to.

2446
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:46,920
Uh-huh.

2447
01:49:48,060 --> 01:49:48,760
What, this one right here?

2448
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,380
Some people are saying we might actually make it to level 5.

2449
01:49:52,240 --> 01:49:52,600
Really?

2450
01:49:52,940 --> 01:49:53,240
We're gamers.

2451
01:49:53,680 --> 01:49:54,340
Oh, we're gamers.

2452
01:49:58,760 --> 01:50:00,400
Oh, oh, it's this area again.

2453
01:50:01,980 --> 01:50:03,160
Oh, there's a little rat.

2454
01:50:03,160 --> 01:50:03,980
Yeah, I think they're randomized.

2455
01:50:04,760 --> 01:50:05,540
Oh, the stalker!

2456
01:50:06,380 --> 01:50:07,360
Fuck off, stalker!

2457
01:50:07,820 --> 01:50:08,780
Stalker, no stalking!

2458
01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:11,280
Oh, I didn't get to see a picture of... Oh, there he is!

2459
01:50:13,660 --> 01:50:14,800
Wait, there's a trap.

2460
01:50:15,080 --> 01:50:16,260
There's a string trap nearby.

2461
01:50:17,660 --> 01:50:18,100
How do you know?

2462
01:50:18,440 --> 01:50:20,000
I took a picture and...

2463
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:20,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2464
01:50:20,980 --> 01:50:23,240
Oh, look on the ceiling, I think, is where you'll see.

2465
01:50:23,600 --> 01:50:24,880
Yeah, I don't see it, though.

2466
01:50:25,380 --> 01:50:25,980
I don't either.

2467
01:50:26,100 --> 01:50:27,860
Just knock me down if it gets me, I guess.

2468
01:50:28,540 --> 01:50:30,500
Oh, there's a weird humpback tick thing!

2469
01:50:30,820 --> 01:50:31,180
Ew!

2470
01:50:31,540 --> 01:50:31,840
What?

2471
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:32,420
It was on here.

2472
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:33,640
Whoa, stalker!

2473
01:50:35,380 --> 01:50:36,620
Stalker behind, stalker behind!

2474
01:50:37,700 --> 01:50:38,420
I got him.

2475
01:50:38,760 --> 01:50:39,380
Oh, there he is.

2476
01:50:39,440 --> 01:50:40,860
What the fuck is that?

2477
01:50:40,920 --> 01:50:41,780
What the hell is that?

2478
01:50:41,840 --> 01:50:43,400
I told you, it's a weird humpback tick!

2479
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:44,480
Oh!

2480
01:50:46,640 --> 01:50:47,380
Do a pose!

2481
01:50:48,060 --> 01:50:48,600
Do a flip!

2482
01:50:49,060 --> 01:50:49,980
I'm gonna point at him.

2483
01:50:52,420 --> 01:50:53,120
Where he going?

2484
01:50:53,280 --> 01:50:53,880
Look at him go!

2485
01:50:54,880 --> 01:50:56,260
Oh my, I see ya.

2486
01:50:57,100 --> 01:50:58,580
Oh, I could selfie that.

2487
01:50:58,640 --> 01:50:58,860
Shambles?

2488
01:51:00,280 --> 01:51:01,620
Oh, I hear something on the left.

2489
01:51:03,340 --> 01:51:04,680
There's a lot of stuff down here.

2490
01:51:04,860 --> 01:51:06,660
There's more threats here, guys.

2491
01:51:06,740 --> 01:51:08,080
There's a lot of threats here.

2492
01:51:08,100 --> 01:51:10,120
We don't even need to leave this front room.

2493
01:51:10,200 --> 01:51:11,700
I think we could just stay in here and...

2494
01:51:11,700 --> 01:51:12,740
Stalker, no stalking!

2495
01:51:13,900 --> 01:51:15,360
Stalker, no stalking!

2496
01:51:18,220 --> 01:51:18,960
I like the stalker.

2497
01:51:19,120 --> 01:51:20,520
The rat's in here.

2498
01:51:21,160 --> 01:51:22,080
Oh wait, no, this is a headcrab.

2499
01:51:22,080 --> 01:51:24,100
Oh my god, what the fuck is that?

2500
01:51:26,640 --> 01:51:27,380
Oh, what was that?

2501
01:51:27,680 --> 01:51:28,300
Oh, okay, nevermind.

2502
01:51:28,360 --> 01:51:30,880
You cannot take a picture of it through the glass, so we would need to go in there.

2503
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:31,480
Wait, there's a...

2504
01:51:31,480 --> 01:51:32,520
Rat, rat, rat, rat!

2505
01:51:34,500 --> 01:51:34,780
Rat!

2506
01:51:35,060 --> 01:51:36,540
Oh my god, where is he trying to go?

2507
01:51:37,200 --> 01:51:37,280
He's diseased!

2508
01:51:37,280 --> 01:51:38,120
He's diseased!

2509
01:51:39,380 --> 01:51:39,660
Alright.

2510
01:51:39,800 --> 01:51:40,900
Do you wanna try and get the headcrab?

2511
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,040
I have a feeling as soon as that door opens, we're gonna be in trouble.

2512
01:51:43,820 --> 01:51:45,040
Okay, we're just letting him in.

2513
01:51:46,680 --> 01:51:47,000
Someone's...

2514
01:51:49,680 --> 01:51:50,480
God damn it!

2515
01:51:50,980 --> 01:51:51,300
Nice.

2516
01:51:51,380 --> 01:51:51,680
I got it.

2517
01:51:51,760 --> 01:51:52,460
I got the photo.

2518
01:51:52,620 --> 01:51:52,900
It's on the floor.

2519
01:51:52,920 --> 01:51:52,960
Thank you.

2520
01:51:54,420 --> 01:51:56,140
It's okay guys, I got the photo.

2521
01:51:56,920 --> 01:51:57,920
Oh, I didn't even die!

2522
01:51:58,000 --> 01:51:58,760
Oh, I'm out of...

2523
01:51:58,760 --> 01:51:59,760
I'm out of film now.

2524
01:51:59,940 --> 01:52:00,360
Dang it.

2525
01:52:00,420 --> 01:52:01,540
Weird tick creature's back!

2526
01:52:02,980 --> 01:52:03,300
He's gone.

2527
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:06,020
He went off to the left.

2528
01:52:07,440 --> 01:52:08,500
I feel like we definitely...

2529
01:52:08,500 --> 01:52:08,600
Oh!

2530
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:09,260
Oh!

2531
01:52:09,900 --> 01:52:11,240
Something just died, I think.

2532
01:52:11,240 --> 01:52:11,620
Oh!

2533
01:52:11,880 --> 01:52:12,100
Ah!

2534
01:52:12,680 --> 01:52:13,120
Whoa!

2535
01:52:13,300 --> 01:52:13,560
Rattler!

2536
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:15,220
Dang!

2537
01:52:15,840 --> 01:52:17,020
There's something else in here?

2538
01:52:17,140 --> 01:52:17,980
It's like a big guy.

2539
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:18,580
Ratt's coming back!

2540
01:52:18,680 --> 01:52:19,540
Watch your feet, watch your feet!

2541
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:20,580
Where is he?

2542
01:52:20,640 --> 01:52:21,000
Where is he?

2543
01:52:21,600 --> 01:52:23,900
He just ran to the end of the room you guys went into.

2544
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:24,780
Oh.

2545
01:52:25,620 --> 01:52:27,400
There's so many monsters here.

2546
01:52:27,720 --> 01:52:29,120
Hunchback tick creature thing.

2547
01:52:29,900 --> 01:52:31,080
Oh, he's just chillin'.

2548
01:52:31,080 --> 01:52:31,100
He's coming after me.

2549
01:52:31,240 --> 01:52:32,220
Can you take a photo with him?

2550
01:52:32,840 --> 01:52:33,340
Oh god!

2551
01:52:33,600 --> 01:52:33,980
I'm running.

2552
01:52:34,480 --> 01:52:35,560
He's coming after me.

2553
01:52:36,800 --> 01:52:38,620
In a really slow kinda way.

2554
01:52:39,140 --> 01:52:39,500
Woo!

2555
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:40,440
Don't get us!

2556
01:52:40,440 --> 01:52:41,020
Don't get us!

2557
01:52:41,160 --> 01:52:41,820
Don't get us!

2558
01:52:42,540 --> 01:52:43,420
Don't get us!

2559
01:52:43,420 --> 01:52:44,140
I'm a journalist!

2560
01:52:44,540 --> 01:52:45,100
I have a...

2561
01:52:45,100 --> 01:52:46,600
I have a journalist pass!

2562
01:52:47,380 --> 01:52:48,560
I'm journalist immunity!

2563
01:52:56,800 --> 01:52:57,740
Wait, where's the...

2564
01:52:57,740 --> 01:52:59,140
Oh, at four I left.

2565
01:53:00,040 --> 01:53:01,160
Maybe big guy will show up.

2566
01:53:01,420 --> 01:53:03,660
I feel like big guy should be outside now.

2567
01:53:10,780 --> 01:53:11,620
Oh no!

2568
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:12,340
He's here!

2569
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:13,000
He's here!

2570
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:13,380
He's here!

2571
01:53:14,660 --> 01:53:14,940
He's here!

2572
01:53:15,780 --> 01:53:16,380
He's here!

2573
01:53:17,700 --> 01:53:18,480
He's here!

2574
01:53:22,220 --> 01:53:26,300
You need to get a good perspective picture.

2575
01:53:27,240 --> 01:53:28,760
I'm trying to get out!

2576
01:53:30,520 --> 01:53:31,020
Wait.

2577
01:53:31,560 --> 01:53:32,160
Guys.

2578
01:53:32,740 --> 01:53:34,240
Our plane is on the other side.

2579
01:53:35,340 --> 01:53:36,060
No it's not.

2580
01:53:36,340 --> 01:53:36,500
Oh.

2581
01:53:37,260 --> 01:53:37,860
Guys.

2582
01:53:38,360 --> 01:53:38,860
You're right.

2583
01:53:38,940 --> 01:53:40,720
Guys, we locked ourselves in.

2584
01:53:41,300 --> 01:53:41,680
Oh god.

2585
01:53:41,680 --> 01:53:42,500
Oh no.

2586
01:53:42,600 --> 01:53:43,200
He lost interest.

2587
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:43,880
He lost interest.

2588
01:53:43,960 --> 01:53:44,440
We're so tiny.

2589
01:53:44,440 --> 01:53:44,840
Okay.

2590
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:45,160
Okay.

2591
01:53:45,200 --> 01:53:45,460
Okay.

2592
01:53:45,700 --> 01:53:47,400
I think we can head back, right?

2593
01:53:48,680 --> 01:53:49,020
Yeah.

2594
01:53:49,100 --> 01:53:50,540
I feel like we wanna get...

2595
01:53:50,540 --> 01:53:50,780
Oh.

2596
01:53:51,240 --> 01:53:51,460
Hey.

2597
01:53:51,920 --> 01:53:52,420
Hey guys.

2598
01:53:52,480 --> 01:53:53,660
He's coming back, guys.

2599
01:53:53,980 --> 01:53:54,240
Oh.

2600
01:53:54,300 --> 01:53:54,440
Oh.

2601
01:53:54,500 --> 01:53:54,820
Just kidding.

2602
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:55,720
He's coming.

2603
01:54:04,420 --> 01:54:05,080
I'm okay.

2604
01:54:05,400 --> 01:54:06,040
I'm okay.

2605
01:54:07,640 --> 01:54:08,480
I'm okay.

2606
01:54:12,100 --> 01:54:13,320
I'm okay, guys.

2607
01:54:15,820 --> 01:54:16,940
Guys, he's still here.

2608
01:54:31,780 --> 01:54:32,960
Are they dead?

2609
01:54:39,380 --> 01:54:41,260
Are they alive?

2610
01:54:44,120 --> 01:54:47,960
Is the safety come on?

2611
01:54:59,310 --> 01:55:00,670
Oh, this is bad.

2612
01:55:06,140 --> 01:55:07,230
Oh, there's a rat.

2613
01:55:08,590 --> 01:55:09,690
Oh my god.

2614
01:55:10,550 --> 01:55:11,550
What choice?

2615
01:55:13,570 --> 01:55:15,330
He's just camping me!

2616
01:55:15,410 --> 01:55:16,590
I can't get out!

2617
01:55:24,830 --> 01:55:26,390
He's literally there!

2618
01:55:29,650 --> 01:55:30,290
Okay.

2619
01:55:35,910 --> 01:55:36,550
Okay.

2620
01:55:41,260 --> 01:55:42,720
Please, please, please, please.

2621
01:55:43,780 --> 01:55:44,900
There's so many.

2622
01:55:45,040 --> 01:55:46,360
There's so many monsters.

2623
01:55:46,680 --> 01:55:48,040
There's so many monsters.

2624
01:55:48,200 --> 01:55:49,280
How do I get through?

2625
01:55:52,240 --> 01:55:52,880
Okay.

2626
01:55:53,160 --> 01:55:54,120
Okay, I can make it.

2627
01:55:54,120 --> 01:55:55,300
I can make it.

2628
01:55:55,460 --> 01:55:56,500
I can make it.

2629
01:56:05,710 --> 01:56:07,990
Guys, he's literally outside the door.

2630
01:56:08,230 --> 01:56:08,860
He's outside.

2631
01:56:14,130 --> 01:56:14,750
Okay.

2632
01:56:14,990 --> 01:56:15,470
Okay.

2633
01:56:15,770 --> 01:56:16,970
Okay, I can make it.

2634
01:56:17,250 --> 01:56:18,290
I can make it.

2635
01:56:19,230 --> 01:56:20,550
I can make it.

2636
01:56:27,150 --> 01:56:28,370
Oh my god, he's right here.

2637
01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:47,740
Oh!

2638
01:56:48,400 --> 01:56:48,900
No!

2639
01:56:57,210 --> 01:56:59,270
I'm gonna everywhere.

2640
01:56:59,270 --> 01:57:01,510
They were everywhere!

2641
01:57:02,570 --> 01:57:03,850
They were everywhere!

2642
01:57:03,870 --> 01:57:06,470
Mint and I got pressed through the world.

2643
01:57:06,930 --> 01:57:09,030
Yeah, we actually clipped Noclip through the map.

2644
01:57:09,290 --> 01:57:10,550
Wait, what?

2645
01:57:11,350 --> 01:57:16,450
There's a photo in Discord where I'm just looking up at the floor from below.

2646
01:57:17,230 --> 01:57:18,210
Yes, yes.

2647
01:57:18,710 --> 01:57:20,490
Oh my god, they were everywhere.

2648
01:57:20,490 --> 01:57:22,370
We got Noclip'd into oblivion.

2649
01:57:22,950 --> 01:57:24,370
There's nowhere to go.

2650
01:57:24,810 --> 01:57:26,190
Yeah, I was like, girl, I'm doing well.

2651
01:57:27,450 --> 01:57:28,650
I hesitated.

2652
01:57:28,650 --> 01:57:31,950
There was so many monsters everywhere.

2653
01:57:33,090 --> 01:57:34,150
I didn't know what to do.

2654
01:57:34,150 --> 01:57:35,310
It's okay, it's okay.

2655
01:57:35,430 --> 01:57:38,790
We're totally gonna get all 3,000 points that we need in this one run.

2656
01:57:39,090 --> 01:57:39,450
We can do it.

2657
01:57:39,470 --> 01:57:40,310
Whoever said...

2658
01:57:40,310 --> 01:57:41,130
We have two runs.

2659
01:57:41,310 --> 01:57:41,810
Oh, never mind.

2660
01:57:41,950 --> 01:57:43,350
No, this is our last run.

2661
01:57:44,110 --> 01:57:47,430
Whoever said we were gonna get to level five, they cursed us.

2662
01:57:47,450 --> 01:57:48,270
They cursed us.

2663
01:57:48,450 --> 01:57:51,190
We had such a good run, too.

2664
01:57:53,110 --> 01:57:53,470
Dang.

2665
01:57:53,470 --> 01:57:54,990
We all have to use all our photos.

2666
01:57:55,150 --> 01:57:56,150
We have to use...

2667
01:57:56,150 --> 01:57:57,570
We have to take as much as we can.

2668
01:57:58,590 --> 01:58:00,670
And make sure we don't get doublose, too.

2669
01:58:01,370 --> 01:58:01,750
Yeah.

2670
01:58:02,090 --> 01:58:02,530
Okay.

2671
01:58:03,690 --> 01:58:04,130
Alright.

2672
01:58:04,430 --> 01:58:05,170
We got this.

2673
01:58:06,550 --> 01:58:07,750
No, our nice camera...

2674
01:58:08,290 --> 01:58:08,730
Gone.

2675
01:58:12,270 --> 01:58:15,950
Okay, there was like five fucking monsters outside my door.

2676
01:58:16,050 --> 01:58:18,770
Like, how the fuck was I gonna get out of there?

2677
01:58:18,790 --> 01:58:20,090
It's such a shame because...

2678
01:58:20,090 --> 01:58:24,090
Because we Noclipped through the planet, it dumped our bodies by the helicopter and our cameras.

2679
01:58:24,270 --> 01:58:25,090
So you could've like...

2680
01:58:25,090 --> 01:58:26,190
Oh my god, really?

2681
01:58:26,210 --> 01:58:27,430
Everything was right there.

2682
01:58:27,650 --> 01:58:28,090
Yeah.

2683
01:58:28,090 --> 01:58:29,370
Oh my god.

2684
01:58:29,670 --> 01:58:31,310
The big stock...

2685
01:58:31,310 --> 01:58:31,610
Oh my...

2686
01:58:31,610 --> 01:58:35,790
If the big red guy didn't block the only way across, I would've ran.

2687
01:58:36,730 --> 01:58:37,170
Yeah.

2688
01:58:37,590 --> 01:58:40,550
I feel like we should go to the door to the right side.

2689
01:58:40,870 --> 01:58:42,350
That had so many monsters.

2690
01:58:43,390 --> 01:58:43,810
Sure, sure.

2691
01:58:43,910 --> 01:58:44,590
Last time...

2692
01:58:44,590 --> 01:58:44,970
Okay, this one right here?

2693
01:58:45,990 --> 01:58:47,010
Yeah, the right side.

2694
01:58:48,350 --> 01:58:48,590
Okay.

2695
01:58:49,630 --> 01:58:52,090
Oh wow, the truck is already overturned.

2696
01:58:52,910 --> 01:58:53,310
Ew.

2697
01:58:53,510 --> 01:58:55,530
But it's okay, I can move it with my head, apparently.

2698
01:58:55,750 --> 01:58:56,010
Yeah, you can push it.

2699
01:58:57,450 --> 01:58:59,110
It gives us a little bit of a cover.

2700
01:58:59,310 --> 01:59:00,090
Yeah, that's true.

2701
01:59:01,350 --> 01:59:02,430
Alright, I'm coming with you.

2702
01:59:02,830 --> 01:59:03,710
Alright, let's go.

2703
01:59:06,970 --> 01:59:09,050
And there's something zooming around at the top.

2704
01:59:09,990 --> 01:59:10,430
Oh, I see it.

2705
01:59:10,430 --> 01:59:11,370
There's something at the top, do you see it?

2706
01:59:11,370 --> 01:59:12,170
Oh, yeah, I see it.

2707
01:59:12,250 --> 01:59:13,570
Oh, there's like two things up there.

2708
01:59:13,770 --> 01:59:14,390
I'm posing, I'm posing.

2709
01:59:15,030 --> 01:59:15,970
Oh, what the fuck is that?

2710
01:59:15,970 --> 01:59:16,610
What the fuck is that?

2711
01:59:17,170 --> 01:59:17,950
I don't like that.

2712
01:59:19,290 --> 01:59:20,010
Everything's wobbling.

2713
01:59:20,270 --> 01:59:20,330
Polpo.

2714
01:59:20,350 --> 01:59:21,630
It's like a spider, man.

2715
01:59:21,690 --> 01:59:22,970
His name is Polpo, apparently.

2716
01:59:23,690 --> 01:59:24,050
Polpo!

2717
01:59:24,070 --> 01:59:24,650
Hey, Polpo.

2718
01:59:25,550 --> 01:59:26,270
Yo, Polpo.

2719
01:59:26,510 --> 01:59:27,050
What you doing?

2720
01:59:27,270 --> 01:59:27,830
I cannot see anything.

2721
01:59:27,930 --> 01:59:28,870
It's so fucking dark.

2722
01:59:29,030 --> 01:59:29,630
We are so dead.

2723
01:59:29,670 --> 01:59:31,230
You can see a little bit better through your camera lens.

2724
01:59:31,230 --> 01:59:32,310
Yeah, that's what I'm doing, too.

2725
01:59:32,330 --> 01:59:33,030
But then you're gonna waste the battery.

2726
01:59:33,770 --> 01:59:34,730
Oh, you don't waste battery.

2727
01:59:34,970 --> 01:59:36,830
The thing is just the camera film.

2728
01:59:38,450 --> 01:59:38,990
Oh, it is?

2729
01:59:39,170 --> 01:59:40,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's not battery.

2730
01:59:40,510 --> 01:59:40,690
Oh.

2731
01:59:41,310 --> 01:59:43,170
Oh, God, it's a little vent gremlin.

2732
01:59:43,510 --> 01:59:43,770
Great.

2733
01:59:44,590 --> 01:59:45,450
And a stalker.

2734
01:59:45,870 --> 01:59:46,970
And another vent gremlin.

2735
01:59:47,550 --> 01:59:47,950
Leave me alone.

2736
01:59:48,570 --> 01:59:48,770
Oh my God.

2737
01:59:48,770 --> 01:59:49,650
What are you gonna do, huh?

2738
01:59:49,830 --> 01:59:50,550
This guy's a dick.

2739
01:59:50,930 --> 01:59:52,030
Oh, he'll take your leg out.

2740
01:59:52,350 --> 01:59:53,110
Yeah, he will actually.

2741
01:59:53,110 --> 01:59:54,270
Yeah, bye, but a high ground.

2742
01:59:54,270 --> 01:59:55,070
He fucking murdered me.

2743
01:59:55,150 --> 01:59:55,930
It was really funny.

2744
01:59:57,730 --> 01:59:58,830
Oh, there's something in there.

2745
01:59:58,910 --> 01:59:59,310
Oh, it's another.

2746
01:59:59,410 --> 02:00:00,450
It's the vent crawler again.

2747
02:00:00,670 --> 02:00:01,210
Hey, buddy.

2748
02:00:01,670 --> 02:00:03,390
No, vent crawler.

2749
02:00:03,710 --> 02:00:04,490
Okay, let me...

2750
02:00:04,490 --> 02:00:04,790
This guy sucks.

2751
02:00:05,050 --> 02:00:08,770
God, I had so many good photos, too, last time.

2752
02:00:09,770 --> 02:00:10,210
He's coming.

2753
02:00:10,530 --> 02:00:11,510
Oh, there he is.

2754
02:00:13,370 --> 02:00:13,770
Ugh.

2755
02:00:15,190 --> 02:00:15,590
Um...

2756
02:00:15,590 --> 02:00:16,550
Not sure about that one, friends.

2757
02:00:17,750 --> 02:00:18,550
Oh, mom.

2758
02:00:19,310 --> 02:00:19,650
I didn't get it.

2759
02:00:22,450 --> 02:00:23,470
What happened to my legs?

2760
02:00:23,470 --> 02:00:24,210
I don't know.

2761
02:00:24,370 --> 02:00:25,210
Should we try and take...

2762
02:00:25,210 --> 02:00:27,970
Like, wait for the big guys to show up and take photos outside or something?

2763
02:00:28,210 --> 02:00:29,730
Do I still have my leg?

2764
02:00:30,690 --> 02:00:31,010
No.

2765
02:00:31,270 --> 02:00:32,030
Well, you do.

2766
02:00:32,310 --> 02:00:32,790
Mint does not.

2767
02:00:33,250 --> 02:00:33,710
I don't.

2768
02:00:33,990 --> 02:00:34,490
Oh, okay.

2769
02:00:35,350 --> 02:00:36,310
I'm okay, too.

2770
02:00:38,410 --> 02:00:40,090
I'd like to get a picture of the stalker.

2771
02:00:41,530 --> 02:00:43,710
Oh, there's another fucking beholder in here, too.

2772
02:00:44,410 --> 02:00:44,810
A what?

2773
02:00:44,950 --> 02:00:45,650
Go away, vent crawler.

2774
02:00:45,650 --> 02:00:49,690
Okay, at, like, six minutes, we have to get out, because that's when the big guy spawns in, I feel.

2775
02:00:50,550 --> 02:00:50,870
Okay.

2776
02:00:51,030 --> 02:00:51,410
Mm-mm.

2777
02:00:51,410 --> 02:00:53,590
Where's the military when we need them?

2778
02:00:53,670 --> 02:00:56,970
What's the point of funding the military when they don't show up when we want them to?

2779
02:00:59,050 --> 02:00:59,350
Hello?

2780
02:00:59,750 --> 02:01:00,770
Has anybody come out?

2781
02:01:01,110 --> 02:01:02,050
I think we're safe now.

2782
02:01:03,110 --> 02:01:04,730
Oh, never mind.

2783
02:01:04,770 --> 02:01:05,010
I didn't realize we had to zoom in.

2784
02:01:05,110 --> 02:01:05,910
You see that little guy?

2785
02:01:05,950 --> 02:01:06,170
I'm such an idiot.

2786
02:01:06,590 --> 02:01:06,910
What do you mean?

2787
02:01:06,950 --> 02:01:08,010
You haven't been zooming in?

2788
02:01:11,450 --> 02:01:11,890
Hello?

2789
02:01:12,250 --> 02:01:12,390
What was that?

2790
02:01:12,770 --> 02:01:14,450
Are you guys...

2791
02:01:14,450 --> 02:01:15,630
Good now?

2792
02:01:16,010 --> 02:01:16,390
Hello?

2793
02:01:17,610 --> 02:01:18,510
Oh, there he is!

2794
02:01:18,530 --> 02:01:18,770
There he is!

2795
02:01:18,770 --> 02:01:18,970
There he is!

2796
02:01:18,970 --> 02:01:19,230
There he is!

2797
02:01:19,230 --> 02:01:19,870
Oh, there's the stalker.

2798
02:01:20,490 --> 02:01:20,950
I got him.

2799
02:01:21,690 --> 02:01:22,130
I didn't.

2800
02:01:22,130 --> 02:01:22,870
I didn't get him.

2801
02:01:22,970 --> 02:01:23,410
I got him.

2802
02:01:23,590 --> 02:01:24,770
We have to, like, pretend we can't see him, so he gets closer.

2803
02:01:24,930 --> 02:01:25,510
He's really annoying.

2804
02:01:27,310 --> 02:01:27,870
Gotta like it.

2805
02:01:27,870 --> 02:01:31,910
Well, I sure hope no big stalker comes and sneaks up behind me.

2806
02:01:32,070 --> 02:01:33,330
I don't notice him.

2807
02:01:35,050 --> 02:01:39,510
Hope you're ashamed if someone just shows up behind me.

2808
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:41,190
I'd sure hate it if a...

2809
02:01:41,190 --> 02:01:41,390
I'm so...

2810
02:01:41,390 --> 02:01:43,510
If a vent crawler ate my ass right now.

2811
02:01:43,590 --> 02:01:44,170
I'm so vulnerable.

2812
02:01:44,170 --> 02:01:45,370
I actually would hate that.

2813
02:01:48,250 --> 02:01:50,690
I'm so vulnerable.

2814
02:01:51,270 --> 02:01:51,430
I'm so vulnerable.

2815
02:01:51,430 --> 02:01:52,330
I don't feel like it might open.

2816
02:01:52,870 --> 02:01:56,470
I'm alone at night right now.

2817
02:01:56,570 --> 02:01:58,470
And I'm shaking my booty.

2818
02:01:59,210 --> 02:01:59,910
Oh, what's gonna happen?

2819
02:01:59,910 --> 02:02:02,990
I think we should split up and go in different directions.

2820
02:02:03,350 --> 02:02:03,730
Hey, guys.

2821
02:02:03,850 --> 02:02:05,150
Let's split up and look for clues.

2822
02:02:06,030 --> 02:02:07,870
No, let's split up and look for clues.

2823
02:02:08,530 --> 02:02:09,470
I've already split...

2824
02:02:09,470 --> 02:02:11,730
Oh, there's a little zoomer guy in there.

2825
02:02:11,750 --> 02:02:12,470
Zuma, zuma, zuma, zuma.

2826
02:02:12,810 --> 02:02:14,030
Oh, I forget to...

2827
02:02:14,030 --> 02:02:15,310
That whole thing is...

2828
02:02:16,930 --> 02:02:17,550
I'm scared.

2829
02:02:17,750 --> 02:02:18,230
We're not gonna...

2830
02:02:18,230 --> 02:02:19,130
Oh, there's another zoomer.

2831
02:02:21,350 --> 02:02:22,950
I don't really know what this guy does.

2832
02:02:23,270 --> 02:02:23,350
I don't know.

2833
02:02:23,350 --> 02:02:24,910
The answer seems to be not anything.

2834
02:02:25,030 --> 02:02:25,150
Oh!

2835
02:02:26,290 --> 02:02:27,030
Stalker, no stalking!

2836
02:02:28,550 --> 02:02:28,870
No!

2837
02:02:28,970 --> 02:02:30,510
I got quite a few points from him.

2838
02:02:30,970 --> 02:02:31,470
I must...

2839
02:02:31,470 --> 02:02:32,070
Oh, what's that?

2840
02:02:33,730 --> 02:02:34,630
Did you see that?

2841
02:02:34,670 --> 02:02:35,490
I'm not getting any of these.

2842
02:02:35,550 --> 02:02:35,770
What the hell?

2843
02:02:35,770 --> 02:02:36,990
Do you see that on the other side?

2844
02:02:38,930 --> 02:02:39,250
No.

2845
02:02:39,890 --> 02:02:40,370
Jump, jump.

2846
02:02:40,410 --> 02:02:40,770
Do you see that?

2847
02:02:40,770 --> 02:02:41,770
Where the fuck is the...

2848
02:02:41,770 --> 02:02:42,470
The Pope is still over there.

2849
02:02:42,790 --> 02:02:43,290
There he is.

2850
02:02:43,290 --> 02:02:45,570
Hey, Pope, come say hi.

2851
02:02:45,790 --> 02:02:46,110
No.

2852
02:02:46,430 --> 02:02:46,930
Alright, we should go out.

2853
02:02:46,930 --> 02:02:47,890
It's five-minute mark.

2854
02:02:48,010 --> 02:02:48,690
It's five-minute mark.

2855
02:02:48,830 --> 02:02:49,390
Don't be shy, Pope.

2856
02:02:50,010 --> 02:02:50,410
Okay.

2857
02:02:50,750 --> 02:02:51,670
It's a five-minute mark.

2858
02:02:51,730 --> 02:02:52,810
He should be outside now.

2859
02:02:58,680 --> 02:02:59,080
Oh!

2860
02:03:07,370 --> 02:03:08,270
Oh, there's soldiers!

2861
02:03:13,470 --> 02:03:14,490
There's a big guy.

2862
02:03:16,430 --> 02:03:19,370
We should try and take photos outside the helicopter or something.

2863
02:03:20,050 --> 02:03:20,550
I can't run!

2864
02:03:20,550 --> 02:03:21,010
I can't run!

2865
02:03:21,290 --> 02:03:21,690
Run!

2866
02:03:21,750 --> 02:03:22,150
Run!

2867
02:03:25,170 --> 02:03:25,630
Wait.

2868
02:03:27,750 --> 02:03:28,950
Oh shit, to our side!

2869
02:03:29,890 --> 02:03:30,850
Don't worry, I got the photo!

2870
02:03:36,920 --> 02:03:37,840
You're ganked!

2871
02:03:38,120 --> 02:03:38,700
Where did you...

2872
02:03:38,700 --> 02:03:39,680
She's still here!

2873
02:03:39,840 --> 02:03:40,280
She's still here!

2874
02:03:47,640 --> 02:03:49,500
This lady is faster than me.

2875
02:03:50,320 --> 02:03:51,340
Because you're not gonna flank.

2876
02:03:58,940 --> 02:04:01,140
This is where...

2877
02:04:01,140 --> 02:04:02,540
It all comes down to this.

2878
02:04:02,920 --> 02:04:05,040
It all comes down to this.

2879
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:06,940
If we make enough...

2880
02:04:06,940 --> 02:04:08,840
If we make enough money...

2881
02:04:09,740 --> 02:04:10,320
No, you didn't!

2882
02:04:11,540 --> 02:04:14,980
It all comes down to our 30 photos.

2883
02:04:15,700 --> 02:04:16,900
Our 30 photos.

2884
02:04:17,060 --> 02:04:17,560
Let's go.

2885
02:04:18,260 --> 02:04:18,700
Alright.

2886
02:04:19,240 --> 02:04:19,260
I believe.

2887
02:04:19,460 --> 02:04:20,060
I believe.

2888
02:04:20,280 --> 02:04:21,040
I believe.

2889
02:04:21,220 --> 02:04:21,660
The drama.

2890
02:04:23,860 --> 02:04:25,060
What the fuck?

2891
02:04:25,460 --> 02:04:27,660
It worked!

2892
02:04:28,460 --> 02:04:29,560
That's a really good one.

2893
02:04:29,840 --> 02:04:30,580
Thank you.

2894
02:04:31,840 --> 02:04:32,840
That's a nice one.

2895
02:04:32,840 --> 02:04:33,680
Okay, that's good.

2896
02:04:33,820 --> 02:04:34,700
That's a good one.

2897
02:04:35,660 --> 02:04:39,560
Oh, that's the cat!

2898
02:04:40,840 --> 02:04:41,400
Yeah!

2899
02:04:41,980 --> 02:04:42,320
Yay!

2900
02:04:43,220 --> 02:04:44,660
It should be enough, I think.

2901
02:04:45,220 --> 02:04:45,840
Hell yeah!

2902
02:04:46,120 --> 02:04:46,420
We made it!

2903
02:04:46,620 --> 02:04:47,880
Yeah, plus 5,000!

2904
02:04:50,360 --> 02:04:52,040
I like how...

2905
02:04:52,040 --> 02:04:52,780
Both selfies...

2906
02:04:53,380 --> 02:04:54,060
God, look at that.

2907
02:04:54,360 --> 02:04:55,800
Guys, three out of...

2908
02:04:55,800 --> 02:04:56,920
Three out of four...

2909
02:04:56,920 --> 02:04:57,920
Our headliners!

2910
02:04:58,800 --> 02:05:01,720
I personally like this one better than this one.

2911
02:05:03,460 --> 02:05:04,940
Yeah, I actually like that one.

2912
02:05:05,020 --> 02:05:06,000
Yeah, that one looks good.

2913
02:05:06,920 --> 02:05:07,920
Do you wanna do...

2914
02:05:09,040 --> 02:05:10,320
A flashy camera?

2915
02:05:10,620 --> 02:05:13,060
There's also an SD camera that gives you 15 pictures.

2916
02:05:13,300 --> 02:05:13,720
Whoa!

2917
02:05:14,180 --> 02:05:15,960
I feel like more photos is good.

2918
02:05:16,840 --> 02:05:17,640
Sure, okay.

2919
02:05:18,460 --> 02:05:19,620
We have $200.

2920
02:05:20,060 --> 02:05:20,920
What do you wanna spend it on?

2921
02:05:21,340 --> 02:05:23,280
Another camera or...

2922
02:05:23,280 --> 02:05:24,860
Some normal flashlights?

2923
02:05:25,980 --> 02:05:27,280
Oh, bravery.

2924
02:05:27,540 --> 02:05:28,160
I got bravery points.

2925
02:05:28,160 --> 02:05:29,200
We could give each other helmets.

2926
02:05:29,520 --> 02:05:31,340
We could spend two helmets for health.

2927
02:05:33,780 --> 02:05:34,640
Oh, I see it.

2928
02:05:34,720 --> 02:05:35,720
What about sports shoes?

2929
02:05:35,740 --> 02:05:36,720
You know, I'm gonna order some helmets.

2930
02:05:37,080 --> 02:05:39,580
Cuz you know when you get attacked by a Venn creature that eats your leg?

2931
02:05:39,680 --> 02:05:39,920
Yeah?

2932
02:05:40,140 --> 02:05:41,600
I think having a helmet on will save your life.

2933
02:05:41,800 --> 02:05:43,180
Oh yeah, yeah, that's a good idea.

2934
02:05:43,720 --> 02:05:47,320
It's basically the same body part, so...

2935
02:05:47,320 --> 02:05:48,660
Wait, you don't need to wear the helmet?

2936
02:05:49,140 --> 02:05:50,100
Oh, I forgot the helmet.

2937
02:05:50,400 --> 02:05:51,100
Alright, I think...

2938
02:05:51,100 --> 02:05:52,020
Well, you have to...

2939
02:05:52,020 --> 02:05:53,640
You don't just wear the helmet.

2940
02:05:54,120 --> 02:05:55,120
Oh, no, you do.

2941
02:05:55,300 --> 02:05:58,460
I think it's because it's an item that you have to hold to get the benefit.

2942
02:05:58,520 --> 02:05:59,360
Oh, there it is.

2943
02:05:59,380 --> 02:06:00,200
Yeah, you have it.

2944
02:06:00,760 --> 02:06:02,400
It's my special helmet.

2945
02:06:02,940 --> 02:06:04,580
Oh, it says press on the back.

2946
02:06:04,600 --> 02:06:05,040
Wait, you don't have it on.

2947
02:06:05,720 --> 02:06:06,040
Is it on?

2948
02:06:06,080 --> 02:06:07,380
No, there's only two.

2949
02:06:07,560 --> 02:06:07,720
Yeah, yours is.

2950
02:06:08,340 --> 02:06:09,820
Well, you guys need it the most.

2951
02:06:10,060 --> 02:06:10,760
No, you two need it.

2952
02:06:11,320 --> 02:06:11,500
Me?

2953
02:06:11,700 --> 02:06:12,000
Really?

2954
02:06:13,400 --> 02:06:17,040
I mean, you're constantly trying to, like, suicide for photos.

2955
02:06:17,080 --> 02:06:17,580
It's the most responsible here.

2956
02:06:18,040 --> 02:06:20,540
So, we are one with the helmets.

2957
02:06:21,540 --> 02:06:22,880
It's our special helmet.

2958
02:06:22,880 --> 02:06:23,840
Wait, how do I equip it?

2959
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,120
Okay, does someone have the camera that takes tons of pictures?

2960
02:06:26,460 --> 02:06:26,860
Wait, how do you...

2961
02:06:26,860 --> 02:06:27,360
Yeah, here.

2962
02:06:28,100 --> 02:06:29,080
How do I equip this?

2963
02:06:29,080 --> 02:06:29,520
No, that's fine.

2964
02:06:29,560 --> 02:06:30,000
You take it.

2965
02:06:30,300 --> 02:06:30,980
How do I equip this?

2966
02:06:31,220 --> 02:06:33,480
Just having it causes it to be yours.

2967
02:06:33,560 --> 02:06:33,760
Yeah.

2968
02:06:34,440 --> 02:06:35,580
Oh, is it on my head now?

2969
02:06:36,280 --> 02:06:38,160
When you scroll off of it, it will be.

2970
02:06:38,880 --> 02:06:39,400
Oh, okay.

2971
02:06:39,640 --> 02:06:40,060
There you go.

2972
02:06:40,100 --> 02:06:40,520
You're good.

2973
02:06:40,960 --> 02:06:41,440
Hey, guys.

2974
02:06:41,480 --> 02:06:41,820
Okay.

2975
02:06:42,440 --> 02:06:44,560
My mom bought this helmet for me for the bus.

2976
02:06:44,820 --> 02:06:45,280
Let's go!

2977
02:06:45,860 --> 02:06:47,820
Wait, before we go, I need to use the bathroom.

2978
02:06:48,440 --> 02:06:49,440
I've been hydrating.

2979
02:06:50,460 --> 02:06:50,980
Got it.

2980
02:06:51,100 --> 02:06:51,660
I'll be right back.

2981
02:06:52,400 --> 02:06:52,800
Okay.

2982
02:06:56,760 --> 02:06:57,700
Is it Thursday?

2983
02:06:57,840 --> 02:06:59,300
No, it's Wednesday today, isn't it?

2984
02:06:59,320 --> 02:07:00,260
It's Wednesday, yeah.

2985
02:07:01,140 --> 02:07:04,160
My sense of time is all messed up because I've been sick.

2986
02:07:04,240 --> 02:07:05,560
I've not been streaming on my normal day.

2987
02:07:05,620 --> 02:07:06,820
So I'm like, what fucking day is it?

2988
02:07:07,700 --> 02:07:09,480
Are you getting proper rest?

2989
02:07:10,620 --> 02:07:15,740
No, I've spent most of the time trying to sleep and then not being able to sleep because I can't breathe.

2990
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:17,960
And then falling asleep because I'm so tired.

2991
02:07:18,140 --> 02:07:19,580
So it's like all over the place.

2992
02:07:19,860 --> 02:07:20,260
Yeah!

2993
02:07:20,640 --> 02:07:21,820
It's the worst!

2994
02:07:23,880 --> 02:07:26,260
I have like no concept of time anymore.

2995
02:07:26,420 --> 02:07:30,840
Because I'll try and go to bed and then I'll lie there from like 2am to 9am.

2996
02:07:31,220 --> 02:07:33,180
And I'm so tired and I didn't get any sleep.

2997
02:07:33,300 --> 02:07:36,000
And then I'll get up and I'll go and sit down in a chair.

2998
02:07:36,100 --> 02:07:38,800
And I'll fall asleep in the chair instead for 3 hours.

2999
02:07:38,960 --> 02:07:42,000
And then I wake up and it's 6pm and I'm like, what the fuck?

3000
02:07:42,400 --> 02:07:44,360
But if you're in the chair, you're like sitting up.

3001
02:07:44,420 --> 02:07:45,880
Maybe that helps your nose.

3002
02:07:45,880 --> 02:07:46,480
Yeah, no.

3003
02:07:46,560 --> 02:07:48,680
When I'm sitting up, I'm less clogged.

3004
02:07:48,900 --> 02:07:50,480
So it's nicer, I think.

3005
02:07:53,120 --> 02:07:54,260
Oh, you sound terrible.

3006
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:55,440
Thanks.

3007
02:07:57,540 --> 02:07:59,640
Yeah, I was sick not too long ago.

3008
02:07:59,720 --> 02:08:00,600
I get it.

3009
02:08:00,900 --> 02:08:02,060
Hello, I'm back.

3010
02:08:02,660 --> 02:08:03,300
Welcome back.

3011
02:08:03,340 --> 02:08:04,200
Did you wash your hands?

3012
02:08:04,300 --> 02:08:05,560
Yeah, I washed my hands.

3013
02:08:05,720 --> 02:08:06,200
Thanks, mom.

3014
02:08:06,620 --> 02:08:06,620
Awesome.

3015
02:08:06,760 --> 02:08:07,540
Proud of you.

3016
02:08:09,080 --> 02:08:11,400
We're the two daughters that need helmets.

3017
02:08:12,180 --> 02:08:14,000
We need helmets on the bus.

3018
02:08:20,530 --> 02:08:22,470
It's back to Times Square, but it's more dangerous.

3019
02:08:23,770 --> 02:08:25,390
God, you look like my...

3020
02:08:25,390 --> 02:08:28,610
My two kids who I don't trust enough to have in safety.

3021
02:08:28,850 --> 02:08:31,310
Yeah, we have the leashes on too.

3022
02:08:31,950 --> 02:08:33,830
The hardest is in everything.

3023
02:08:35,170 --> 02:08:36,470
You're pulling us...

3024
02:08:38,250 --> 02:08:38,630
What?

3025
02:08:40,430 --> 02:08:41,410
Die already!

3026
02:08:42,290 --> 02:08:42,770
How?

3027
02:08:46,880 --> 02:08:49,680
You were alive for 30 seconds.

3028
02:08:49,940 --> 02:08:51,560
Well, get home and find us.

3029
02:08:51,800 --> 02:08:53,200
I ran into a

3030
02:08:58,120 --> 02:08:58,680
car.

3031
02:09:02,860 --> 02:09:05,380
Have you ever been run over by a parked car?

3032
02:09:06,560 --> 02:09:09,900
I got run over by a parked car!

3033
02:09:10,460 --> 02:09:11,540
What the fuck?

3034
02:09:11,560 --> 02:09:13,300
I wonder if someone was like underneath the car.

3035
02:09:13,640 --> 02:09:15,160
I don't think there was.

3036
02:09:15,240 --> 02:09:17,700
I think she literally just got physics to death.

3037
02:09:17,780 --> 02:09:21,740
You know in like Source games where something's like vibrating and it causes you to take like...

3038
02:09:22,640 --> 02:09:24,080
Velocity collision damage?

3039
02:09:24,140 --> 02:09:25,480
I think she did that with a car.

3040
02:09:26,620 --> 02:09:28,700
I need a stronger helmet.

3041
02:09:29,940 --> 02:09:31,100
Let's go in here.

3042
02:09:31,180 --> 02:09:31,740
It'll be funny.

3043
02:09:33,140 --> 02:09:34,860
Why is it making creepy noises?

3044
02:09:35,020 --> 02:09:36,000
I don't know, I'm gonna die.

3045
02:09:36,140 --> 02:09:37,300
It's a horrible noise.

3046
02:09:37,880 --> 02:09:39,120
It's not fair.

3047
02:09:40,280 --> 02:09:42,300
Do you want the special camera that you have?

3048
02:09:42,440 --> 02:09:44,360
Because I got the flashlight, so here you go.

3049
02:09:44,640 --> 02:09:44,920
Okay.

3050
02:09:45,380 --> 02:09:46,060
I take more photos.

3051
02:09:46,580 --> 02:09:47,660
I trust you with it.

3052
02:09:47,920 --> 02:09:48,400
You'll be great.

3053
02:09:48,940 --> 02:09:50,260
Oh, we're in the same room as both of them.

3054
02:09:51,040 --> 02:09:51,760
What the fuck?

3055
02:09:52,120 --> 02:09:52,980
Oh, hey Cthulhu.

3056
02:09:53,540 --> 02:09:54,200
What's our beholder?

3057
02:09:54,280 --> 02:09:55,300
I get them mixed up sometimes.

3058
02:09:56,180 --> 02:09:56,900
That helmet...

3059
02:09:57,420 --> 02:10:00,320
That helmet was fucking made of plastic.

3060
02:10:02,580 --> 02:10:04,020
Oh, look.

3061
02:10:04,500 --> 02:10:06,660
I can't believe it.

3062
02:10:07,060 --> 02:10:09,560
I'm so sad.

3063
02:10:10,460 --> 02:10:13,320
I'm so excited with my helmet.

3064
02:10:13,320 --> 02:10:15,480
I'm just trying to figure out what that weird bleeping noise is.

3065
02:10:15,560 --> 02:10:16,780
I was so excited.

3066
02:10:17,160 --> 02:10:22,280
I was ready to explore a new world with my mom and sister.

3067
02:10:22,780 --> 02:10:24,840
Oh, that's not terrifying at all.

3068
02:10:26,940 --> 02:10:28,660
Oh my god.

3069
02:10:29,240 --> 02:10:31,140
What the fuck?

3070
02:10:36,360 --> 02:10:37,520
Alrighty then.

3071
02:10:38,700 --> 02:10:39,960
I literally was like...

3072
02:10:41,400 --> 02:10:44,420
This DJ card took me out.

3073
02:10:45,020 --> 02:10:45,700
Wait, is it?

3074
02:10:45,780 --> 02:10:46,600
I think it's that.

3075
02:10:46,700 --> 02:10:47,720
Oh my gosh, it's a...

3076
02:10:47,720 --> 02:10:49,080
Oh, there are mines.

3077
02:10:49,120 --> 02:10:51,640
We're truly the most lethal of companies right now.

3078
02:10:52,020 --> 02:10:52,600
Oh, there are mines.

3079
02:10:53,060 --> 02:10:53,920
Oh my god.

3080
02:10:54,020 --> 02:10:55,680
This is level three.

3081
02:10:57,160 --> 02:10:57,920
Leap loop.

3082
02:10:59,000 --> 02:10:59,420
Leap.

3083
02:11:01,100 --> 02:11:02,040
Leap boop.

3084
02:11:02,660 --> 02:11:04,140
I wish I was there.

3085
02:11:04,140 --> 02:11:04,920
Leap boop.

3086
02:11:06,180 --> 02:11:09,040
Oh, I wanna sneeze like constantly.

3087
02:11:09,260 --> 02:11:10,020
It's fucking awful.

3088
02:11:10,660 --> 02:11:12,200
Oh, there's a dude being eaten.

3089
02:11:12,680 --> 02:11:12,880
That's cool.

3090
02:11:12,880 --> 02:11:13,620
Oh yeah, there is.

3091
02:11:14,760 --> 02:11:18,300
I can probably get a sick pose in front of it because of the height.

3092
02:11:19,220 --> 02:11:21,220
Yeah, let's get us both in there.

3093
02:11:23,220 --> 02:11:24,600
Oh, there's a guy in here for sure.

3094
02:11:26,340 --> 02:11:27,900
It's just a boulder.

3095
02:11:28,560 --> 02:11:29,500
Do you get a good picture?

3096
02:11:30,040 --> 02:11:30,960
Oh, he's coming up.

3097
02:11:31,060 --> 02:11:31,580
He's coming up.

3098
02:11:32,460 --> 02:11:33,480
Hey, what's up?

3099
02:11:34,800 --> 02:11:36,900
I wish I could be part of this.

3100
02:11:38,440 --> 02:11:40,040
I wish I could be part of the fun.

3101
02:11:40,060 --> 02:11:44,880
I mean, I get weird music when he looks at me, so maybe if you let him stare at you too long, bad stuff happens?

3102
02:11:45,080 --> 02:11:45,340
I don't know.

3103
02:11:45,380 --> 02:11:45,760
Ah, maybe.

3104
02:11:46,540 --> 02:11:52,420
I think, I kind of remember boulders, if you look at them, you go nuts, so maybe just, I don't know, don't stare at him.

3105
02:11:52,560 --> 02:11:52,820
I don't know.

3106
02:11:52,860 --> 02:11:53,680
Oh, he's up there too.

3107
02:11:54,260 --> 02:11:55,380
Oh, yeah, I'm starting to get tired.

3108
02:11:55,380 --> 02:11:56,040
Oh, he's gone again.

3109
02:11:56,260 --> 02:11:56,900
Or something weird.

3110
02:11:57,800 --> 02:12:03,280
Level three is so dangerous that even a car can...

3111
02:12:03,280 --> 02:12:05,220
Everything was fine before!

3112
02:12:05,820 --> 02:12:07,640
Oh, there's some goop I will overhear.

3113
02:12:08,120 --> 02:12:09,580
And that's a trap right there.

3114
02:12:09,760 --> 02:12:10,280
Or it was.

3115
02:12:10,640 --> 02:12:12,220
Oh my god.

3116
02:12:13,540 --> 02:12:14,800
I don't understand.

3117
02:12:17,980 --> 02:12:19,520
That's kind of scrungly.

3118
02:12:22,780 --> 02:12:23,940
Just my luck.

3119
02:12:24,520 --> 02:12:26,240
Just my fucking luck, guys.

3120
02:12:26,680 --> 02:12:27,660
I think this is where we started.

3121
02:12:29,060 --> 02:12:30,900
I died from a parked car.

3122
02:12:30,900 --> 02:12:32,980
Just jokey things, guys.

3123
02:12:33,200 --> 02:12:34,360
Just jokey things.

3124
02:12:34,580 --> 02:12:35,160
I don't know.

3125
02:12:35,760 --> 02:12:37,080
Wait, what the fuck?

3126
02:12:37,560 --> 02:12:38,640
Turn around, look.

3127
02:12:39,180 --> 02:12:40,240
Impossible geometry.

3128
02:12:41,560 --> 02:12:43,340
It's a literal suicide door.

3129
02:12:44,580 --> 02:12:46,720
It's perfect for this moment, not gonna lie.

3130
02:12:47,640 --> 02:12:49,380
How many pictures did you get?

3131
02:12:49,460 --> 02:12:52,300
Do you think we should just go outside and take some pictures of the carnage outside?

3132
02:12:52,840 --> 02:12:54,480
I have eight out of fifteen left.

3133
02:12:54,960 --> 02:12:55,280
Alright.

3134
02:12:55,600 --> 02:12:56,480
Pretty nice.

3135
02:12:57,060 --> 02:12:59,880
I got tons of cameras.

3136
02:12:59,880 --> 02:13:00,720
You're right.

3137
02:13:01,280 --> 02:13:02,680
I didn't look both ways.

3138
02:13:07,800 --> 02:13:12,380
Oh, the big guys should be outside now.

3139
02:13:12,500 --> 02:13:13,380
Yeah, they should go out.

3140
02:13:13,600 --> 02:13:14,440
It's five minute mark.

3141
02:13:15,120 --> 02:13:18,060
Oh, there's another headcrab thingy.

3142
02:13:19,440 --> 02:13:21,640
Or, you know, like a head muncher.

3143
02:13:25,240 --> 02:13:26,220
Oh, they're outside.

3144
02:13:27,260 --> 02:13:28,860
Let me see you outside.

3145
02:13:28,980 --> 02:13:30,720
Go outside, go outside, guys!

3146
02:13:30,860 --> 02:13:31,440
Go outside!

3147
02:13:33,720 --> 02:13:34,680
Come on!

3148
02:13:35,440 --> 02:13:37,880
You think there's something sweet outside as a result?

3149
02:13:38,280 --> 02:13:39,780
Go outside, it's time.

3150
02:13:39,880 --> 02:13:41,400
It happens in the five minute mark.

3151
02:13:41,480 --> 02:13:42,400
I'm gonna go look.

3152
02:13:42,720 --> 02:13:43,540
Yeah, let's go look.

3153
02:13:47,560 --> 02:13:48,520
Holy shit!

3154
02:13:50,240 --> 02:13:50,980
Uh, hello?

3155
02:13:51,600 --> 02:13:53,160
Oh, what the fuck?

3156
02:13:53,280 --> 02:13:53,900
That's a tornado!

3157
02:13:56,220 --> 02:13:58,340
Oh my god, oh my god!

3158
02:14:02,100 --> 02:14:04,400
Another side, oh my god!

3159
02:14:05,480 --> 02:14:05,960
I hate that.

3160
02:14:06,940 --> 02:14:07,740
He's just looking.

3161
02:14:08,920 --> 02:14:10,920
He's tossing shit at us, what a dick.

3162
02:14:12,420 --> 02:14:14,600
Wouldn't it be funny if it hits them right there?

3163
02:14:15,220 --> 02:14:15,800
There's a car.

3164
02:14:16,080 --> 02:14:17,500
They're literally right next to each other.

3165
02:14:17,680 --> 02:14:18,980
He can actually get a 2K right here.

3166
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:23,160
We can just hang out here and take some pictures and then whoever dies first, you pick up their camera and just leave.

3167
02:14:23,580 --> 02:14:26,060
They're literally like, oh my god, they're next to each other.

3168
02:14:26,140 --> 02:14:26,980
It's gonna be a 2K.

3169
02:14:27,200 --> 02:14:29,180
He literally could get 2 kills in one hit.

3170
02:14:29,360 --> 02:14:32,740
He's running towards the tornado, which is like an interesting battle strategy.

3171
02:14:32,880 --> 02:14:33,000
He's just there, yes.

3172
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:34,300
I don't know if it's gonna work out for him.

3173
02:14:34,540 --> 02:14:35,900
Great survival instincts.

3174
02:14:38,180 --> 02:14:39,740
Take a selfie, take a selfie, guys!

3175
02:14:39,740 --> 02:14:40,680
I gotta get closer to it.

3176
02:14:41,760 --> 02:14:44,440
Okay, maybe you could pose or something, I'll take a picture of you.

3177
02:14:44,500 --> 02:14:44,840
Yeah, yeah.

3178
02:14:46,060 --> 02:14:46,440
I'm posing.

3179
02:14:47,220 --> 02:14:47,760
I'm posing.

3180
02:14:48,360 --> 02:14:48,760
I'm posing.

3181
02:14:48,880 --> 02:14:50,440
Uh, turn back towards me, there we go.

3182
02:14:50,820 --> 02:14:51,520
Sick picture.

3183
02:14:53,160 --> 02:14:53,560
Yeah!

3184
02:14:55,900 --> 02:14:57,400
I can't join the party.

3185
02:14:57,400 --> 02:15:00,420
Oh, there's a monster, there's like a stompy monster over there.

3186
02:15:00,720 --> 02:15:01,680
Oh, there's a couple actually.

3187
02:15:02,300 --> 02:15:03,560
His name is Clubby.

3188
02:15:03,820 --> 02:15:05,880
I can't join the party.

3189
02:15:05,900 --> 02:15:06,920
He's got a club.

3190
02:15:09,500 --> 02:15:13,160
I'm just in the corner watching.

3191
02:15:13,760 --> 02:15:14,320
Well,

3192
02:15:19,120 --> 02:15:22,560
I have two more, so I guess I'll just take some...

3193
02:15:22,560 --> 02:15:26,680
Yeah, I mean, we can wait a couple more minutes, see if anything cool shows up in the last minute or two.

3194
02:15:26,740 --> 02:15:27,620
This guy isn't very threatening.

3195
02:15:28,140 --> 02:15:28,400
No.

3196
02:15:29,140 --> 02:15:32,540
He's actively moving away from us while staring us down in impotence.

3197
02:15:32,600 --> 02:15:34,780
He's actually the least threatening monster out of all of them.

3198
02:15:34,780 --> 02:15:36,520
He looks like he should be so intimidating, but nothing's happened.

3199
02:15:36,540 --> 02:15:42,140
Yeah, I mean, it was really scary when we spawned right next to him, and then he was like, oh, I'm sorry, I'll move for you.

3200
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,400
Just get a vacuum, guys, come on.

3201
02:15:46,040 --> 02:15:46,780
Suck him up.

3202
02:15:47,040 --> 02:15:49,140
There's nobody here either, it's just kinda chill.

3203
02:15:49,200 --> 02:15:51,600
Just be careful of the car that killed Doki, I guess.

3204
02:15:51,600 --> 02:15:53,440
Oh yeah, don't touch the car.

3205
02:15:54,140 --> 02:15:55,840
The car casualty.

3206
02:15:57,680 --> 02:16:01,040
Hey Doki, are you still inhabiting your dead body over here?

3207
02:16:03,880 --> 02:16:04,960
I'm out of photos.

3208
02:16:07,780 --> 02:16:10,000
I'm getting in, cause I'm out of photos.

3209
02:16:11,580 --> 02:16:12,480
It's okay.

3210
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:14,100
We'll remember you.

3211
02:16:14,400 --> 02:16:18,600
They're just dancing, I'm dead and she's just dancing.

3212
02:16:18,600 --> 02:16:19,300
Dancing.

3213
02:16:24,360 --> 02:16:26,780
I brought Doki with us.

3214
02:16:28,370 --> 02:16:32,380
What bright side, there's no bright side.

3215
02:16:34,350 --> 02:16:36,920
I didn't even get to play the game.

3216
02:16:38,100 --> 02:16:41,040
I didn't get to play the game.

3217
02:16:41,100 --> 02:16:47,220
We're gonna protect you with your safety helmets, and then you won't get to a stationary car and fucking die.

3218
02:16:47,760 --> 02:16:49,340
Here's your helmet back, Doki.

3219
02:16:49,660 --> 02:16:51,720
I just thought it was funny.

3220
02:16:57,400 --> 02:17:00,900
Oh, that's a good photo.

3221
02:17:04,880 --> 02:17:08,380
I like how it's just selfies of you and the big guy.

3222
02:17:09,520 --> 02:17:12,600
I mean, he was really considerate, he just chilled and let us do our thing.

3223
02:17:12,600 --> 02:17:13,900
Oh, that's a good one.

3224
02:17:14,060 --> 02:17:14,900
That photo's good.

3225
02:17:14,920 --> 02:17:15,980
That's a really cool one.

3226
02:17:20,020 --> 02:17:22,080
Oh, 4,000, wow.

3227
02:17:22,400 --> 02:17:24,100
50% of it on the first one.

3228
02:17:24,980 --> 02:17:26,920
Your helmet's back by the desk, Doki.

3229
02:17:27,120 --> 02:17:31,020
Okay, this helmet's made out of plastic, there's no way.

3230
02:17:32,400 --> 02:17:33,600
There's no way.

3231
02:17:37,020 --> 02:17:38,920
Wait, who has the blue camera?

3232
02:17:39,680 --> 02:17:40,620
There's a blue camera right there.

3233
02:17:40,880 --> 02:17:41,720
Oh, it's right here.

3234
02:17:41,980 --> 02:17:42,540
It's right there.

3235
02:17:42,880 --> 02:17:43,880
It respawned.

3236
02:17:43,960 --> 02:17:45,840
Oh, yeah, it respawned on my bed.

3237
02:17:46,380 --> 02:17:47,920
Alright, I'll use it then.

3238
02:17:48,780 --> 02:17:49,140
Yeah.

3239
02:17:49,840 --> 02:17:50,720
Alright, let's go.

3240
02:17:51,400 --> 02:17:54,180
Now I know cars are dangerous no matter what.

3241
02:17:54,980 --> 02:17:56,780
Never get in a car, guys.

3242
02:17:56,860 --> 02:17:58,220
Never get on top of a car.

3243
02:17:59,120 --> 02:18:00,620
Cars, not even ones.

3244
02:18:01,060 --> 02:18:01,780
Don't do it.

3245
02:18:11,180 --> 02:18:13,820
I'm pretty sure you bought this helmet from a kid's section.

3246
02:18:16,720 --> 02:18:17,240
Already?

3247
02:18:17,680 --> 02:18:18,180
50 % already.

3248
02:18:18,400 --> 02:18:18,720
Yeah.

3249
02:18:20,220 --> 02:18:21,540
Alright, avoid this.

3250
02:18:21,540 --> 02:18:22,700
He's a raccoon!

3251
02:18:23,900 --> 02:18:27,800
Hey mister, did you know if you chat with me, you can get a good deal on your vehicle insurance?

3252
02:18:28,440 --> 02:18:30,880
Don't say I didn't do nothing for you.

3253
02:18:31,460 --> 02:18:32,580
Is there something over here?

3254
02:18:33,140 --> 02:18:33,480
Hello?

3255
02:18:33,760 --> 02:18:37,040
I'm curious, if we just stay outside the whole time, how things start appearing.

3256
02:18:37,420 --> 02:18:38,280
If they do, at least.

3257
02:18:38,380 --> 02:18:38,780
Like, you know?

3258
02:18:38,860 --> 02:18:39,580
Oh, that's true.

3259
02:18:39,760 --> 02:18:40,440
I mean, we could.

3260
02:18:40,540 --> 02:18:40,980
I wonder.

3261
02:18:43,500 --> 02:18:44,900
It's at the 5 minute mark.

3262
02:18:44,920 --> 02:18:45,580
There's a building, do you see?

3263
02:18:45,960 --> 02:18:48,960
Someone should go and camp that building and take really cool aerial shots.

3264
02:18:48,980 --> 02:18:49,720
Oh, that's true.

3265
02:18:49,880 --> 02:18:50,360
Do you see that ladder over there?

3266
02:18:50,360 --> 02:18:52,120
Yeah, I can do that.

3267
02:18:52,600 --> 02:18:54,060
Wait, there's also a door over here.

3268
02:18:54,060 --> 02:18:54,740
Yeah, there is.

3269
02:18:55,080 --> 02:18:55,580
That's TV.

3270
02:18:55,640 --> 02:19:02,440
Oh yeah, so someone stay outside and the other people get photos just in case, like, something terrible happens when you just camp outside and we lose the run.

3271
02:19:02,540 --> 02:19:02,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3272
02:19:03,180 --> 02:19:05,440
Oh, exclusion.

3273
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:06,680
Oh, okay.

3274
02:19:06,920 --> 02:19:08,080
I'll stay outside.

3275
02:19:09,180 --> 02:19:10,020
Of course you will.

3276
02:19:12,140 --> 02:19:14,600
Come on, mid, let's go be brave.

3277
02:19:14,740 --> 02:19:16,480
Yeah, let's go do actual jobs.

3278
02:19:16,520 --> 02:19:18,120
You guys suggested that!

3279
02:19:19,620 --> 02:19:21,120
Don't worry, guys.

3280
02:19:22,300 --> 02:19:25,020
I'll get the coolest shots out there.

3281
02:19:25,940 --> 02:19:28,460
Oh my god, so cool.

3282
02:19:28,860 --> 02:19:29,920
Look at me, mom.

3283
02:19:31,120 --> 02:19:31,520
Wait.

3284
02:19:32,600 --> 02:19:33,320
Okay, what?

3285
02:19:33,760 --> 02:19:34,280
Oh, wait.

3286
02:19:34,500 --> 02:19:37,360
What emote should I do?

3287
02:19:38,600 --> 02:19:39,560
I should do that.

3288
02:19:41,020 --> 02:19:41,920
Look at that.

3289
02:19:42,020 --> 02:19:44,020
It's like I'm like a tourist right now.

3290
02:19:44,380 --> 02:19:46,040
My 18 points.

3291
02:19:46,560 --> 02:19:48,020
I'm like a little tourist.

3292
02:19:48,440 --> 02:19:49,880
Oh, I hope I don't fall.

3293
02:19:50,560 --> 02:19:52,160
I hope I don't accidentally fall.

3294
02:19:52,220 --> 02:19:53,140
Oh, wait, how do I get down?

3295
02:19:53,220 --> 02:19:54,000
Okay, it's right here.

3296
02:19:54,500 --> 02:19:55,900
I won't accidentally fall.

3297
02:19:55,960 --> 02:19:56,700
There's no way.

3298
02:19:58,960 --> 02:20:00,080
Alright, let's see.

3299
02:20:00,160 --> 02:20:02,040
There is black and white codex.

3300
02:20:03,060 --> 02:20:05,340
Where maximum performance it lives.

3301
02:20:07,500 --> 02:20:09,380
Like, it was the last day.

3302
02:20:09,420 --> 02:20:10,340
Oh, look at that!

3303
02:20:10,860 --> 02:20:13,340
Step into debt one pair at a time.

3304
02:20:14,740 --> 02:20:16,460
I wonder when they start appearing though.

3305
02:20:16,560 --> 02:20:17,720
It's at five minutes, right?

3306
02:20:18,700 --> 02:20:20,300
Should be five or six minutes.

3307
02:20:21,760 --> 02:20:23,480
Oh, that's like McDonald's.

3308
02:20:24,240 --> 02:20:24,640
WhackDonald's.

3309
02:20:25,500 --> 02:20:27,280
So sweet that you will be diabetic.

3310
02:20:28,560 --> 02:20:29,260
Look around you.

3311
02:20:29,320 --> 02:20:30,360
The world is different.

3312
02:20:31,340 --> 02:20:32,080
I believe in this.

3313
02:20:32,120 --> 02:20:33,280
There's no way I'll die here.

3314
02:20:33,460 --> 02:20:34,360
I feel so safe.

3315
02:20:35,380 --> 02:20:37,240
I honestly wonder how he appears though.

3316
02:20:38,100 --> 02:20:38,380
Wait.

3317
02:20:47,500 --> 02:20:50,160
Oh, I can't get the cool selfie here.

3318
02:20:51,100 --> 02:20:52,200
Wait, is he dead?

3319
02:20:55,420 --> 02:20:55,900
Okay.

3320
02:21:00,450 --> 02:21:02,210
Oh, they're dead dead.

3321
02:21:04,270 --> 02:21:05,310
Oh, goodbye.

3322
02:21:07,250 --> 02:21:08,750
I don't think he sees me up here.

3323
02:21:10,890 --> 02:21:11,990
What do you mean Doki doesn't know?

3324
02:21:12,070 --> 02:21:13,030
What do you mean by that?

3325
02:21:13,810 --> 02:21:14,810
I'm so safe.

3326
02:21:17,330 --> 02:21:18,650
Oh, it's six minutes.

3327
02:21:19,650 --> 02:21:21,390
I wonder how he appears though.

3328
02:21:22,990 --> 02:21:24,630
There's like gunshots here.

3329
02:21:27,790 --> 02:21:28,750
There's like...

3330
02:21:29,290 --> 02:21:31,070
Guys, I've covered wars, you know.

3331
02:21:31,190 --> 02:21:31,570
Look at that.

3332
02:21:31,630 --> 02:21:32,990
I have battlefield photos.

3333
02:21:34,390 --> 02:21:36,730
That's when you know I got the experience.

3334
02:21:37,570 --> 02:21:39,070
Where did he even come from?

3335
02:21:39,290 --> 02:21:41,130
Where did this big guy even come from?

3336
02:21:42,090 --> 02:21:42,970
We're getting closer.

3337
02:21:44,450 --> 02:21:45,650
Oh, there he is.

3338
02:21:45,650 --> 02:21:46,390
Wait.

3339
02:21:54,430 --> 02:21:56,730
I feel like I hear ghosts right now.

3340
02:21:58,570 --> 02:21:59,990
I wonder where they are.

3341
02:22:14,340 --> 02:22:16,620
Oh shit, what the fuck is that?

3342
02:22:17,280 --> 02:22:20,020
Oh my god, the fuck is that?

3343
02:22:20,480 --> 02:22:21,940
Oh, is that the alien dog?

3344
02:22:24,340 --> 02:22:25,360
Oh shit.

3345
02:22:27,020 --> 02:22:28,400
Okay, but where's the tornado?

3346
02:22:34,900 --> 02:22:35,760
Where's the tornado?

3347
02:22:52,460 --> 02:22:54,540
Oh, there he is.

3348
02:23:00,650 --> 02:23:01,710
Come on, there he is.

3349
02:23:02,050 --> 02:23:03,130
Okay, it's time to go.

3350
02:23:05,450 --> 02:23:06,750
It's time to go.

3351
02:23:10,350 --> 02:23:11,110
I'm scared.

3352
02:23:20,090 --> 02:23:20,790
Oh, there's the other.

3353
02:23:23,410 --> 02:23:25,310
Don't worry, I'm gonna be the hero.

3354
02:23:27,710 --> 02:23:29,750
As soon as I figure out how to get down from here.

3355
02:23:34,150 --> 02:23:35,010
It's okay.

3356
02:23:36,730 --> 02:23:38,850
I'm gonna be the last one alive.

3357
02:23:40,330 --> 02:23:42,870
That's right, it's your turn to watch me.

3358
02:23:47,450 --> 02:23:47,970
Okay.

3359
02:23:52,840 --> 02:23:53,360
Cool.

3360
02:23:54,180 --> 02:23:56,520
Alright, don't worry, I got three more of these.

3361
02:24:00,060 --> 02:24:01,020
Don't worry.

3362
02:24:01,760 --> 02:24:03,580
I'm doing it for you guys.

3363
02:24:07,600 --> 02:24:08,960
And then...

3364
02:24:08,960 --> 02:24:09,780
Ta-da!

3365
02:24:10,460 --> 02:24:10,840
Alright.

3366
02:24:11,220 --> 02:24:13,860
It's so hard being me sometimes.

3367
02:24:14,480 --> 02:24:15,240
I did it.

3368
02:24:16,300 --> 02:24:18,300
It's so hard being me.

3369
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:19,920
I'm a hero.

3370
02:24:30,080 --> 02:24:31,880
I did it, guys.

3371
02:24:34,120 --> 02:24:35,360
What happened?

3372
02:24:37,600 --> 02:24:39,340
We found out what the beholder does.

3373
02:24:39,440 --> 02:24:42,440
If he manages to get close enough to you when he spins, he explodes.

3374
02:24:43,060 --> 02:24:45,360
Oh, wait, did you guys all explode?

3375
02:24:46,180 --> 02:24:48,900
I got it all, but you died.

3376
02:24:50,020 --> 02:24:52,020
Our camera is doing it.

3377
02:24:56,700 --> 02:24:58,340
What a hero.

3378
02:24:59,360 --> 02:25:00,660
Don't worry, guys.

3379
02:25:00,740 --> 02:25:02,410
I got us the photos we needed.

3380
02:25:04,360 --> 02:25:06,040
Look at that.

3381
02:25:07,260 --> 02:25:08,540
I got that.

3382
02:25:09,260 --> 02:25:11,120
And then I did that.

3383
02:25:11,840 --> 02:25:12,880
And then...

3384
02:25:17,420 --> 02:25:19,340
Another one of the tornadoes.

3385
02:25:28,560 --> 02:25:31,740
Yeah, but I got us 3,000 points, though.

3386
02:25:33,260 --> 02:25:34,860
Don't worry, everybody.

3387
02:25:35,060 --> 02:25:36,220
No need to thank me.

3388
02:25:37,800 --> 02:25:39,540
No need to thank me, guys.

3389
02:25:39,960 --> 02:25:42,980
I'm just being a hero that we deserve.

3390
02:25:47,340 --> 02:25:47,860
Hey,

3391
02:25:52,780 --> 02:25:53,040
guys.

3392
02:25:53,280 --> 02:25:55,240
We still have our SD camera.

3393
02:25:55,240 --> 02:25:56,580
I will remember this, Doki.

3394
02:25:56,840 --> 02:25:57,780
I will remember this.

3395
02:26:08,270 --> 02:26:14,010
I had some cool photos, too, but I died.

3396
02:26:14,910 --> 02:26:17,370
We all died when we had some really cool photos.

3397
02:26:18,070 --> 02:26:19,450
You died to a car.

3398
02:26:19,570 --> 02:26:20,310
I don't wanna hear it.

3399
02:26:25,930 --> 02:26:28,610
It was a very scary car.

3400
02:26:31,470 --> 02:26:32,850
I wonder if I could just...

3401
02:26:32,850 --> 02:26:33,190
Hold on.

3402
02:26:33,230 --> 02:26:34,670
Could it just happen at any time?

3403
02:26:35,330 --> 02:26:35,570
What?

3404
02:26:35,970 --> 02:26:36,790
You did something special.

3405
02:26:37,010 --> 02:26:38,690
I just ran straight into that car and nothing happened.

3406
02:26:38,790 --> 02:26:39,050
No, no.

3407
02:26:39,110 --> 02:26:40,470
You have to run in the front of the car.

3408
02:26:40,590 --> 02:26:41,850
In the front of the car.

3409
02:26:42,130 --> 02:26:42,710
Her body, her skin, and her paper, and her...

3410
02:26:42,710 --> 02:26:42,970
Okay.

3411
02:26:43,250 --> 02:26:43,610
Okay.

3412
02:26:44,410 --> 02:26:44,630
Look.

3413
02:26:45,290 --> 02:26:47,470
Yeah, my bones are very fragile.

3414
02:26:50,350 --> 02:26:51,610
I don't know...

3415
02:26:54,430 --> 02:26:57,250
That looks like a scary car right there.

3416
02:27:00,430 --> 02:27:01,590
It's super pretty.

3417
02:27:01,690 --> 02:27:02,110
Look at this.

3418
02:27:02,110 --> 02:27:03,090
We've never been here.

3419
02:27:04,110 --> 02:27:05,370
This is new.

3420
02:27:05,390 --> 02:27:06,710
This is so awesome.

3421
02:27:07,950 --> 02:27:09,510
Wait, could we see the...

3422
02:27:09,510 --> 02:27:11,870
Could we see the guy spawn from the side?

3423
02:27:11,870 --> 02:27:12,770
I don't think so.

3424
02:27:13,510 --> 02:27:15,470
We'll hear the siren and stuff.

3425
02:27:16,270 --> 02:27:18,570
Yeah, the siren basically says he spawns, which is cool.

3426
02:27:18,610 --> 02:27:20,510
He spawns at the five minute mark.

3427
02:27:20,530 --> 02:27:22,090
Everything makes me think of her.

3428
02:27:22,430 --> 02:27:22,950
Suggie.

3429
02:27:24,970 --> 02:27:26,550
I like this layout.

3430
02:27:28,610 --> 02:27:29,690
Yeah, I like it too.

3431
02:27:30,990 --> 02:27:31,210
Snom.

3432
02:27:32,690 --> 02:27:33,210
Snom.

3433
02:27:34,170 --> 02:27:35,250
Which way do we go?

3434
02:27:36,090 --> 02:27:38,450
We have no flashlight, so...

3435
02:27:38,450 --> 02:27:39,670
We have to look through our camera.

3436
02:27:41,590 --> 02:27:47,490
I'm going to follow Mint because clearly she knows what she's doing and now hasn't died multiple times.

3437
02:27:49,310 --> 02:27:51,910
I go in for...

3438
02:27:51,910 --> 02:27:52,410
The thrill.

3439
02:27:52,690 --> 02:27:52,930
The scoop.

3440
02:27:53,110 --> 02:27:54,610
The scoop of it all.

3441
02:27:55,310 --> 02:27:57,450
That's why she has the purple heart in journalism.

3442
02:27:57,450 --> 02:28:00,450
Purple heart in journalism.

3443
02:28:01,190 --> 02:28:04,810
It's not chocolate, it's not vanilla, it's mint chocolate chip, baby.

3444
02:28:05,690 --> 02:28:06,890
That's the scoop.

3445
02:28:07,470 --> 02:28:09,070
Oh, we just went in a big circle.

3446
02:28:10,330 --> 02:28:11,270
Where are the monsters?

3447
02:28:11,470 --> 02:28:12,450
Oh yeah, it was really good.

3448
02:28:12,570 --> 02:28:13,550
Great journalism, everybody.

3449
02:28:14,090 --> 02:28:15,590
Can we hear it?

3450
02:28:16,630 --> 02:28:18,290
I keep thinking that's an Enderman.

3451
02:28:20,330 --> 02:28:21,990
Oh wait, there's so much blood over here.

3452
02:28:24,330 --> 02:28:24,770
Where?

3453
02:28:25,330 --> 02:28:26,010
You hear the music?

3454
02:28:26,830 --> 02:28:27,930
Yeah, I do too.

3455
02:28:28,130 --> 02:28:28,470
Yeah.

3456
02:28:28,730 --> 02:28:29,550
I don't hear music.

3457
02:28:29,810 --> 02:28:31,190
It's like a...

3458
02:28:31,190 --> 02:28:33,270
Wait, there's body parts here.

3459
02:28:34,550 --> 02:28:35,550
I don't hear music.

3460
02:28:35,850 --> 02:28:37,710
Are you guys having a mass hallucination right now?

3461
02:28:38,310 --> 02:28:38,850
No, I do.

3462
02:28:38,890 --> 02:28:39,610
It's to the right.

3463
02:28:41,330 --> 02:28:42,530
Listen to the coffee.

3464
02:28:45,030 --> 02:28:46,950
Did you just say listen to the coffee?

3465
02:28:47,210 --> 02:28:48,310
That's what this says.

3466
02:28:48,630 --> 02:28:49,770
Yeah, I'm not crazy.

3467
02:28:49,770 --> 02:28:50,510
I thought it was the pizza.

3468
02:28:50,770 --> 02:28:52,910
You're advancing madness or some shit.

3469
02:28:53,030 --> 02:28:53,910
Listen to the coffee.

3470
02:28:54,130 --> 02:28:55,110
Do you hear the music?

3471
02:28:59,070 --> 02:28:59,650
I don't hear music.

3472
02:28:59,650 --> 02:29:00,670
Alright, ladies first.

3473
02:29:00,790 --> 02:29:02,770
This dark might get you fucking nothing though.

3474
02:29:03,210 --> 02:29:04,150
Yeah, it was like one point.

3475
02:29:04,310 --> 02:29:05,490
Oh, there's a beholder in that room.

3476
02:29:05,650 --> 02:29:06,670
Do not let him get close.

3477
02:29:06,810 --> 02:29:07,390
That guy's a dick.

3478
02:29:08,350 --> 02:29:09,490
Hey, go away.

3479
02:29:10,090 --> 02:29:10,570
Go away.

3480
02:29:10,870 --> 02:29:12,770
He might start chasing after us though.

3481
02:29:12,910 --> 02:29:14,110
Wait, does that what he does?

3482
02:29:14,170 --> 02:29:14,630
He chases?

3483
02:29:15,650 --> 02:29:16,890
Yeah, he does come after you.

3484
02:29:17,550 --> 02:29:19,910
Oh god, I'm starting to go a little bit cuckoo.

3485
02:29:20,370 --> 02:29:22,630
Okay, so I think you can't stare at him.

3486
02:29:22,690 --> 02:29:23,490
I think that's actually...

3487
02:29:26,010 --> 02:29:27,190
Oh, it's a CCTV room.

3488
02:29:28,290 --> 02:29:31,470
Yeah, there's no exit here.

3489
02:29:32,190 --> 02:29:35,350
I keep feeling like you can find loot in these places.

3490
02:29:38,530 --> 02:29:40,010
Oh, we have to go out soon.

3491
02:29:40,250 --> 02:29:41,250
It's almost five minutes.

3492
02:29:42,730 --> 02:29:44,710
Oh, what was that?

3493
02:29:45,770 --> 02:29:46,430
That's a mine.

3494
02:29:47,850 --> 02:29:49,030
Oh, I'm gonna take a picture of the mine.

3495
02:29:50,150 --> 02:29:51,830
Yeah, you can take a picture of it.

3496
02:29:52,310 --> 02:29:53,610
But it's not a lot of mines.

3497
02:29:54,470 --> 02:29:55,690
Oh, it's just 29.

3498
02:29:56,910 --> 02:29:58,310
Okay, we should go now.

3499
02:29:59,510 --> 02:29:59,790
Yeah.

3500
02:30:00,090 --> 02:30:01,230
A big guy shows up here.

3501
02:30:01,470 --> 02:30:01,810
A big guy.

3502
02:30:04,490 --> 02:30:06,030
Wait, how do we go back?

3503
02:30:06,590 --> 02:30:08,290
Is there really a point of going inside?

3504
02:30:08,430 --> 02:30:08,730
I wonder.

3505
02:30:09,190 --> 02:30:12,610
This area was very tame for a three-star.

3506
02:30:14,030 --> 02:30:14,550
Yeah.

3507
02:30:15,630 --> 02:30:17,570
Maybe everything's upstairs up here.

3508
02:30:18,790 --> 02:30:19,630
Oh no, it's a den.

3509
02:30:20,110 --> 02:30:21,210
Oh, seriously?

3510
02:30:22,270 --> 02:30:22,490
Oh.

3511
02:30:25,050 --> 02:30:26,750
Well, things seem chill.

3512
02:30:41,310 --> 02:30:43,150
He should spawn up soon, right?

3513
02:30:44,230 --> 02:30:46,630
There's a big guy over here if you want a picture in the meantime.

3514
02:30:47,270 --> 02:30:48,090
Oh, there is.

3515
02:30:50,490 --> 02:30:52,230
He's prowling around the cars.

3516
02:30:52,890 --> 02:30:53,590
Wait, where is he?

3517
02:30:53,870 --> 02:30:55,270
There's some dogs too, actually.

3518
02:30:58,970 --> 02:31:00,930
Oh, they're savaging some dudes.

3519
02:31:01,450 --> 02:31:02,450
Rest in peace.

3520
02:31:03,310 --> 02:31:04,910
Oh yeah, there's a big guy over there.

3521
02:31:05,870 --> 02:31:06,470
Wait, where's the turret?

3522
02:31:09,750 --> 02:31:10,470
Oh no.

3523
02:31:11,030 --> 02:31:11,710
Oh hey, you're alive.

3524
02:31:11,810 --> 02:31:12,130
What's up?

3525
02:31:12,150 --> 02:31:12,950
Wait, what happened?

3526
02:31:13,030 --> 02:31:13,590
What killed me?

3527
02:31:13,930 --> 02:31:15,330
It was the manhole thing.

3528
02:31:15,710 --> 02:31:16,750
It was over there.

3529
02:31:16,810 --> 02:31:17,490
Oh my god.

3530
02:31:17,490 --> 02:31:18,230
Did you get some pictures, miss?

3531
02:31:19,050 --> 02:31:19,410
No.

3532
02:31:19,630 --> 02:31:20,810
Well, I saw something fly.

3533
02:31:20,890 --> 02:31:22,370
I think I took a picture of something flying.

3534
02:31:22,790 --> 02:31:24,090
Doki got eaten by a manhole.

3535
02:31:24,730 --> 02:31:25,410
Wait, did she die?

3536
02:31:25,430 --> 02:31:26,930
I'm alive, bitch.

3537
02:31:27,070 --> 02:31:27,310
Almost.

3538
02:31:28,090 --> 02:31:29,310
There's a guy right in front of me.

3539
02:31:29,390 --> 02:31:30,610
Oh, and there's another guy right here.

3540
02:31:30,650 --> 02:31:31,170
We should leave.

3541
02:31:31,170 --> 02:31:31,750
I think the helmet...

3542
02:31:31,750 --> 02:31:32,590
We should leave.

3543
02:31:32,690 --> 02:31:36,570
I think it's right next... I think it spawned right next to where the...

3544
02:31:36,570 --> 02:31:37,910
I can run past it.

3545
02:31:39,090 --> 02:31:40,790
Oh, he's right next to the helicopter.

3546
02:31:41,030 --> 02:31:41,310
Okay.

3547
02:31:41,630 --> 02:31:42,770
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

3548
02:31:45,730 --> 02:31:50,310
If we go heavily to the left, I think he can't go that way and he'll go past us.

3549
02:31:50,450 --> 02:31:51,270
I'm gonna go right side.

3550
02:31:51,470 --> 02:31:53,050
Okay, I go right, you go left.

3551
02:31:54,270 --> 02:31:54,930
Okay, Doki.

3552
02:31:55,570 --> 02:31:56,370
I'm gonna do it.

3553
02:32:04,170 --> 02:32:05,030
Where's the plane?

3554
02:32:06,730 --> 02:32:07,790
Oh, it's right here.

3555
02:32:12,620 --> 02:32:13,820
Yeah, I did it.

3556
02:32:14,020 --> 02:32:14,620
I was right.

3557
02:32:15,760 --> 02:32:17,800
How did I live through all of that?

3558
02:32:19,140 --> 02:32:20,240
Wait, where are they?

3559
02:32:25,340 --> 02:32:27,120
It was that easy.

3560
02:32:30,990 --> 02:32:32,290
Yeah, I told you.

3561
02:32:32,350 --> 02:32:33,610
I just walk around.

3562
02:32:35,430 --> 02:32:40,250
Oh, I don't think they're gonna... I'm gonna know if they made it or not soon.

3563
02:32:46,570 --> 02:32:49,130
I'm gonna figure out if they make it or not.

3564
02:32:51,870 --> 02:32:52,430
Oh,

3565
02:32:56,350 --> 02:32:57,730
I was dead?

3566
02:32:59,930 --> 02:33:00,490
See?

3567
02:33:00,750 --> 02:33:02,390
They're like, okay, Doki.

3568
02:33:02,790 --> 02:33:05,050
And then I'm the one who lives.

3569
02:33:05,910 --> 02:33:06,650
What do you mean?

3570
02:33:06,770 --> 02:33:08,910
I literally didn't... They didn't even trust me.

3571
02:33:09,870 --> 02:33:12,110
They didn't even trust my plan.

3572
02:33:12,490 --> 02:33:14,910
They decided to not listen to my plan.

3573
02:33:23,490 --> 02:33:27,540
I was like... I legit... I was just like...

3574
02:33:29,070 --> 02:33:29,770
Mint!

3575
02:33:29,850 --> 02:33:30,210
Mint!

3576
02:33:30,330 --> 02:33:31,410
You fucking idiot!

3577
02:33:31,610 --> 02:33:33,580
Oh my god.

3578
02:33:38,620 --> 02:33:40,130
You just walked past.

3579
02:33:43,440 --> 02:33:43,960
I lived.

3580
02:33:45,710 --> 02:33:46,400
I lived.

3581
02:33:47,700 --> 02:33:48,440
Get a camera.

3582
02:33:49,260 --> 02:33:49,900
You get a camera.

3583
02:33:56,070 --> 02:33:57,210
I lived.

3584
02:33:57,210 --> 02:33:58,650
You should've believed in me, Lime.

3585
02:33:58,790 --> 02:34:01,330
You should've... You did not believe in my plan.

3586
02:34:01,490 --> 02:34:02,330
Mine was the safest.

3587
02:34:02,330 --> 02:34:04,810
Your plan was literally, I'll go right, you go left.

3588
02:34:04,910 --> 02:34:06,230
So we went left, you went right.

3589
02:34:06,310 --> 02:34:07,670
That was your plan.

3590
02:34:07,710 --> 02:34:08,150
No, no.

3591
02:34:08,190 --> 02:34:11,810
You didn't believe... You did not believe in the power of the right side.

3592
02:34:11,930 --> 02:34:13,210
So I was like, okay, you left then.

3593
02:34:13,290 --> 02:34:13,830
You told us to go left.

3594
02:34:13,830 --> 02:34:13,830
I was scared.

3595
02:34:13,830 --> 02:34:14,310
No, no.

3596
02:34:14,430 --> 02:34:15,550
I was like, I'm gonna go right.

3597
02:34:15,690 --> 02:34:17,990
You guys didn't believe in my right side.

3598
02:34:18,570 --> 02:34:19,470
That was scary.

3599
02:34:20,230 --> 02:34:21,570
It was really good, actually.

3600
02:34:21,730 --> 02:34:23,930
The guy fucking sniped me with a car.

3601
02:34:24,690 --> 02:34:25,690
Oh my god.

3602
02:34:25,690 --> 02:34:28,110
I got hit by a car.

3603
02:34:28,570 --> 02:34:29,230
Yeah, you did.

3604
02:34:29,410 --> 02:34:30,410
I saw it happen.

3605
02:34:30,710 --> 02:34:31,670
Oh my god.

3606
02:34:31,710 --> 02:34:32,130
What's this?

3607
02:34:36,730 --> 02:34:38,230
Look at that.

3608
02:34:38,470 --> 02:34:41,010
Another selfie yet again.

3609
02:34:41,070 --> 02:34:41,950
Oh my god.

3610
02:34:42,050 --> 02:34:44,010
Look at the fucking selfie board.

3611
02:34:44,290 --> 02:34:46,030
The Frontline News selfies.

3612
02:34:48,470 --> 02:34:51,790
Another selfie headliner on the board.

3613
02:34:51,790 --> 02:34:54,470
Yeah, and everyone gets to see your fucking helmet.

3614
02:34:56,990 --> 02:34:58,930
My special helmet.

3615
02:34:59,910 --> 02:35:00,950
Everybody gets helmets.

3616
02:35:01,430 --> 02:35:02,790
My special helmet.

3617
02:35:06,250 --> 02:35:09,130
I'm just saying, I'm just really good at the news.

3618
02:35:09,390 --> 02:35:10,190
What can I say?

3619
02:35:11,110 --> 02:35:11,930
Oh my god.

3620
02:35:12,090 --> 02:35:12,790
There you go.

3621
02:35:12,870 --> 02:35:14,310
Now we can all have helmets.

3622
02:35:14,690 --> 02:35:16,090
Look how many helmets we have.

3623
02:35:17,730 --> 02:35:18,330
Yay!

3624
02:35:19,350 --> 02:35:20,890
Our special!

3625
02:35:22,490 --> 02:35:24,410
Blue cameras for everybody too.

3626
02:35:24,650 --> 02:35:26,310
Oh wow, I have one too.

3627
02:35:32,190 --> 02:35:33,390
Repeated photo.

3628
02:35:41,350 --> 02:35:45,530
Do we see if they give us something cool and new on the next difficulty level?

3629
02:35:46,290 --> 02:35:47,310
Yeah, I see.

3630
02:35:47,830 --> 02:35:51,370
I think like every time we beat a level, we get to see a new monster.

3631
02:35:52,190 --> 02:35:53,930
Yeah, it seems to be the case.

3632
02:35:55,790 --> 02:35:59,070
Oh yeah, we're all special now.

3633
02:35:59,270 --> 02:36:00,490
We all have the special helmet.

3634
02:36:01,270 --> 02:36:02,690
Lime, you lost your hair.

3635
02:36:03,150 --> 02:36:08,250
Oh my, oh three, almost four.

3636
02:36:12,590 --> 02:36:13,550
Arthur's Square.

3637
02:36:15,530 --> 02:36:17,570
I have a photo of you dancing in front of the thing.

3638
02:36:19,190 --> 02:36:20,650
Oh hey, hey, remember this?

3639
02:36:20,730 --> 02:36:21,510
This is where we started.

3640
02:36:22,730 --> 02:36:23,170
Yay!

3641
02:36:24,130 --> 02:36:25,110
Back to the beginning.

3642
02:36:25,530 --> 02:36:27,290
I'm like scared of going near cars now.

3643
02:36:27,530 --> 02:36:30,150
I don't trust these.

3644
02:36:31,230 --> 02:36:31,550
I have PTSD.

3645
02:36:31,550 --> 02:36:34,530
I hear bars and ladders and...

3646
02:36:35,490 --> 02:36:36,810
Yeah, pretty much everything.

3647
02:36:37,230 --> 02:36:38,670
I mean, there's nothing in front of us.

3648
02:36:38,830 --> 02:36:40,350
This is a horrible map.

3649
02:36:40,430 --> 02:36:43,010
This is like a really difficult map to start people on.

3650
02:36:43,090 --> 02:36:43,510
Yeah.

3651
02:36:43,510 --> 02:36:45,970
Cause like it's so far away.

3652
02:36:46,250 --> 02:36:48,330
There's a building actually right across here.

3653
02:36:49,290 --> 02:36:49,750
Oh yeah.

3654
02:36:50,070 --> 02:36:51,650
Oh yeah, we haven't gone to that building yet.

3655
02:36:51,670 --> 02:36:52,290
It's called the Sarota Bank.

3656
02:36:52,590 --> 02:36:54,530
I wanna go to Sarota Bank.

3657
02:36:55,250 --> 02:37:00,350
I feel like we should all stay outside and like camp somewhere and then get the big monster when he comes.

3658
02:37:00,490 --> 02:37:00,970
Cowards.

3659
02:37:01,370 --> 02:37:02,130
Coward method.

3660
02:37:02,730 --> 02:37:04,110
Yeah, I meant you coward.

3661
02:37:04,250 --> 02:37:05,730
I would never do something like that.

3662
02:37:07,590 --> 02:37:09,810
Oh, it's a hotel lobby.

3663
02:37:09,810 --> 02:37:10,630
This building looks cool.

3664
02:37:11,410 --> 02:37:12,630
It's a lot hotel.

3665
02:37:13,590 --> 02:37:14,850
I like it.

3666
02:37:15,090 --> 02:37:17,770
You wanna stay outside and not see this amazing place?

3667
02:37:17,870 --> 02:37:18,350
I know right?

3668
02:37:18,430 --> 02:37:20,030
Look at this amazing hotel.

3669
02:37:20,970 --> 02:37:23,170
I mean, amazing is subjective.

3670
02:37:24,870 --> 02:37:27,910
That means like, that means there's vacancy guys.

3671
02:37:29,770 --> 02:37:31,890
We can get a suite for a discount.

3672
02:37:31,970 --> 02:37:34,130
Oh my god, we can get like the king suite.

3673
02:37:34,490 --> 02:37:35,130
A suite discount.

3674
02:37:35,670 --> 02:37:36,030
Whoa.

3675
02:37:40,070 --> 02:37:41,910
Okay, this just looks like an office now.

3676
02:37:43,790 --> 02:37:45,090
Now we're back in the studio.

3677
02:37:45,970 --> 02:37:47,110
We're back in the studio.

3678
02:37:47,450 --> 02:37:47,650
How do you feel?

3679
02:37:47,650 --> 02:37:48,330
Oh, there's the pupil.

3680
02:37:58,950 --> 02:37:59,810
He's right there.

3681
02:38:01,650 --> 02:38:02,750
Oh yeah, I see him.

3682
02:38:06,530 --> 02:38:07,630
What is it doing?

3683
02:38:08,090 --> 02:38:10,690
Wish it's closer, so I can get a better photo.

3684
02:38:18,170 --> 02:38:18,610
Ew.

3685
02:38:20,250 --> 02:38:21,930
He's like a little tarantula.

3686
02:38:22,810 --> 02:38:23,790
I don't even see him.

3687
02:38:24,450 --> 02:38:25,890
He's like right over here, under here.

3688
02:38:26,270 --> 02:38:27,490
Oh, I see him.

3689
02:38:31,250 --> 02:38:32,130
He's pupalulating.

3690
02:38:32,830 --> 02:38:34,370
He's like a little octopus.

3691
02:38:35,510 --> 02:38:35,870
Yeah.

3692
02:38:36,990 --> 02:38:38,570
Uh oh, he's going upstairs now.

3693
02:38:38,690 --> 02:38:39,750
Yeah, but he can't do anything.

3694
02:38:39,950 --> 02:38:41,130
He's just a...

3695
02:38:43,310 --> 02:38:44,190
I'm pretty sure.

3696
02:38:45,010 --> 02:38:45,770
Oh, he's leaving.

3697
02:38:47,490 --> 02:38:48,690
Oh, he just walked away.

3698
02:38:48,970 --> 02:38:50,210
See, I told you, he can't do anything.

3699
02:38:51,630 --> 02:38:52,770
Going through our exit.

3700
02:38:53,350 --> 02:38:54,510
The way we need to go.

3701
02:38:55,310 --> 02:38:57,470
I'm sure we won't have a problem when we need to leave.

3702
02:38:59,590 --> 02:39:01,090
There's usually a way around anyway.

3703
02:39:01,970 --> 02:39:03,750
Oh, there's like the skin mass here.

3704
02:39:03,890 --> 02:39:04,590
The stalagmites.

3705
02:39:04,770 --> 02:39:05,590
The alien stalagmites.

3706
02:39:05,730 --> 02:39:09,350
I feel like the building layouts in this game are a little bit better than Lethal Company.

3707
02:39:09,610 --> 02:39:15,610
In that if you go like more than 10 feet from the entrance, you don't get endlessly lost inside an infinite labyrinth and never get out again.

3708
02:39:16,670 --> 02:39:18,270
What I learned from Lethal Com...

3709
02:39:19,870 --> 02:39:20,270
Grab!

3710
02:39:26,190 --> 02:39:27,670
I got a cool photo though.

3711
02:39:28,370 --> 02:39:31,890
You got a 700 score photo because he was flying at my face.

3712
02:39:38,110 --> 02:39:39,450
We should go out now?

3713
02:39:39,570 --> 02:39:41,490
I got a 900 photo.

3714
02:39:41,810 --> 02:39:42,250
Me too.

3715
02:39:42,350 --> 02:39:43,150
I got one too.

3716
02:39:47,510 --> 02:39:48,250
Let's go.

3717
02:39:49,230 --> 02:39:50,950
That is a modified dog.

3718
02:39:54,640 --> 02:39:55,900
Can you pose for me?

3719
02:39:59,900 --> 02:40:00,660
Thank you.

3720
02:40:03,240 --> 02:40:03,840
Nice pose.

3721
02:40:03,840 --> 02:40:07,360
I like how the immediate pose is just like the fucking hands in the air.

3722
02:40:07,560 --> 02:40:08,620
Pose number 8, baby!

3723
02:40:09,440 --> 02:40:09,840
Oh,

3724
02:40:13,100 --> 02:40:13,360
hello.

3725
02:40:14,440 --> 02:40:15,320
Can you pose for me?

3726
02:40:18,750 --> 02:40:19,050
Nice.

3727
02:40:19,810 --> 02:40:20,730
Oh, nice, nice.

3728
02:40:24,250 --> 02:40:25,070
Beautiful, beautiful.

3729
02:40:27,170 --> 02:40:27,710
Was it here?

3730
02:40:27,850 --> 02:40:29,990
This was the way to do the shortcut, right?

3731
02:40:32,050 --> 02:40:33,470
It's not there anymore.

3732
02:40:35,570 --> 02:40:36,170
Wait.

3733
02:40:36,650 --> 02:40:38,670
There used to be a box there, I think.

3734
02:40:38,970 --> 02:40:40,230
Nope, still works.

3735
02:40:41,110 --> 02:40:42,110
Still works.

3736
02:40:43,030 --> 02:40:45,170
Oh, he's here.

3737
02:40:55,780 --> 02:40:57,300
Oh, it's the military men.

3738
02:41:01,110 --> 02:41:01,830
Where are they?

3739
02:41:02,970 --> 02:41:03,730
To the left.

3740
02:41:05,570 --> 02:41:07,030
I don't think they actually can.

3741
02:41:08,370 --> 02:41:09,610
There's our plane.

3742
02:41:10,570 --> 02:41:12,770
But, like, where's our... No, I don't think they can.

3743
02:41:13,110 --> 02:41:14,270
We gotta watch them die, though.

3744
02:41:16,910 --> 02:41:18,250
Over here in front of me.

3745
02:41:19,390 --> 02:41:21,130
Oh, there it is.

3746
02:41:23,830 --> 02:41:24,910
I got it.

3747
02:41:24,950 --> 02:41:25,910
I got the photo.

3748
02:41:26,170 --> 02:41:27,870
There's a...

3749
02:41:29,430 --> 02:41:31,450
Big dude with a fist behind us.

3750
02:41:31,610 --> 02:41:32,290
Oh, shit!

3751
02:41:32,690 --> 02:41:34,170
It's the big man again.

3752
02:41:42,170 --> 02:41:42,870
What's he gonna do?

3753
02:41:42,950 --> 02:41:43,470
Slap me?

3754
02:41:45,530 --> 02:41:46,250
He's gonna slap.

3755
02:41:46,370 --> 02:41:46,970
He's gonna slap.

3756
02:41:52,980 --> 02:41:53,900
Is he slapping?

3757
02:41:57,620 --> 02:41:58,440
Oh, my God.

3758
02:41:58,520 --> 02:42:00,000
What are you doing right now?

3759
02:42:00,140 --> 02:42:00,840
What are you...

3760
02:42:00,840 --> 02:42:02,380
What are you doing?

3761
02:42:05,100 --> 02:42:06,860
Okay, I think we got the photos, right?

3762
02:42:07,860 --> 02:42:08,540
I'm leaving.

3763
02:42:09,740 --> 02:42:11,580
Alright, just selfie with him.

3764
02:42:11,660 --> 02:42:12,100
I'm leaving.

3765
02:42:14,220 --> 02:42:15,540
I got my 10.

3766
02:42:22,350 --> 02:42:23,230
Oh, my God.

3767
02:42:23,370 --> 02:42:25,590
If I see you die right next to the plane...

3768
02:42:27,030 --> 02:42:28,650
Oh, my God.

3769
02:42:28,890 --> 02:42:32,590
If I see you die right next to the plane...

3770
02:42:35,390 --> 02:42:36,110
Oh, wait.

3771
02:42:36,690 --> 02:42:37,630
I guess I have more photos.

3772
02:42:37,630 --> 02:42:40,370
That's what I'm saying.

3773
02:42:43,230 --> 02:42:43,790
Dang it.

3774
02:42:43,890 --> 02:42:44,790
I got his ass, though.

3775
02:42:45,310 --> 02:42:46,190
I have one more.

3776
02:42:46,390 --> 02:42:46,590
Oh, wait.

3777
02:42:46,650 --> 02:42:47,170
That's Simba?

3778
02:42:49,230 --> 02:42:49,690
Wait, wait.

3779
02:42:49,750 --> 02:42:50,190
Do a pose.

3780
02:42:50,370 --> 02:42:50,790
Oh, wait.

3781
02:42:50,910 --> 02:42:51,570
Did she die?

3782
02:42:52,370 --> 02:42:52,750
Yes.

3783
02:42:54,050 --> 02:42:55,950
She was a little too cocky there.

3784
02:42:56,050 --> 02:42:57,090
Her helmet, though.

3785
02:42:58,450 --> 02:43:00,170
Well, I guess no helmet for her.

3786
02:43:00,170 --> 02:43:01,090
She's got three photos.

3787
02:43:04,050 --> 02:43:04,450
Alright.

3788
02:43:08,210 --> 02:43:08,970
Scram.

3789
02:43:09,050 --> 02:43:09,570
You die.

3790
02:43:15,390 --> 02:43:16,810
Oh, he's walking.

3791
02:43:17,010 --> 02:43:20,050
Oh, my God.

3792
02:43:20,310 --> 02:43:20,910
Oh,

3793
02:43:24,220 --> 02:43:25,340
my God.

3794
02:43:25,680 --> 02:43:28,060
I think you could have actually died there.

3795
02:43:31,680 --> 02:43:33,200
Oh, my God.

3796
02:43:33,600 --> 02:43:38,240
Literally, a car flew over your head when you...

3797
02:43:40,920 --> 02:43:44,500
I got killed because I decided to take a selfie as a bus flew at me.

3798
02:43:45,560 --> 02:43:46,860
Wait, did it show up?

3799
02:43:46,920 --> 02:43:48,080
Did that photo show up?

3800
02:43:48,140 --> 02:43:48,620
Oh, my God.

3801
02:43:48,640 --> 02:43:49,160
I hope so.

3802
02:43:50,100 --> 02:43:50,680
I want to see.

3803
02:43:50,760 --> 02:43:53,880
I hope we get that photo of the bus.

3804
02:43:55,220 --> 02:43:56,680
What the fuck is this photo?

3805
02:44:00,480 --> 02:44:03,100
I think that was the bus that flew at me.

3806
02:44:04,780 --> 02:44:05,380
What's this?

3807
02:44:08,160 --> 02:44:09,040
Very nice.

3808
02:44:15,480 --> 02:44:15,960
Nice.

3809
02:44:16,380 --> 02:44:18,140
Damn, we almost got it in one.

3810
02:44:18,300 --> 02:44:18,920
Oh, my God.

3811
02:44:19,040 --> 02:44:20,280
Yeah, we just need one more.

3812
02:44:21,060 --> 02:44:22,740
Wait, how many photos do we need?

3813
02:44:24,300 --> 02:44:25,260
Like, 600.

3814
02:44:25,720 --> 02:44:26,200
600.

3815
02:44:26,380 --> 02:44:27,660
I like this photo the best.

3816
02:44:28,500 --> 02:44:30,360
The Darwin Award right there.

3817
02:44:31,660 --> 02:44:32,620
Let's download that.

3818
02:44:33,540 --> 02:44:36,140
I like how we have two POV of this.

3819
02:44:38,440 --> 02:44:40,720
You have me taking a photo of her.

3820
02:44:40,720 --> 02:44:43,020
We need more because you were in the picture.

3821
02:44:43,260 --> 02:44:44,920
Yeah, I was also in the photo.

3822
02:44:50,860 --> 02:44:51,980
Oh, my God.

3823
02:44:53,040 --> 02:44:54,380
It's so cursed.

3824
02:44:54,580 --> 02:44:55,980
Wait, which one was the photo we got hit?

3825
02:44:57,080 --> 02:44:58,080
I don't know.

3826
02:44:58,360 --> 02:45:00,480
Maybe it didn't go up before I fucking ate shit.

3827
02:45:00,680 --> 02:45:01,060
No.

3828
02:45:01,940 --> 02:45:03,560
This one is so stupid.

3829
02:45:03,700 --> 02:45:04,960
I like this one.

3830
02:45:07,980 --> 02:45:09,580
This one got the most points, though.

3831
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:14,360
Because it was a repeated photo.

3832
02:45:14,440 --> 02:45:15,740
This is the second photo you took.

3833
02:45:15,940 --> 02:45:19,000
If this was your first photo, you would have got more.

3834
02:45:19,940 --> 02:45:20,840
Yeah, I think so.

3835
02:45:22,300 --> 02:45:24,720
I mean, that photo alone got you a thousand.

3836
02:45:25,600 --> 02:45:26,280
That's crazy.

3837
02:45:26,720 --> 02:45:27,220
Hell, yeah.

3838
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:28,700
Hell, yeah.

3839
02:45:28,860 --> 02:45:32,160
This game is easier, I think, than Lethal Company.

3840
02:45:32,780 --> 02:45:33,380
Much easier, yeah.

3841
02:45:33,380 --> 02:45:36,760
Because we know when to go, too, now.

3842
02:45:36,880 --> 02:45:37,280
Yeah.

3843
02:45:38,120 --> 02:45:39,020
Oh, okay.

3844
02:45:39,740 --> 02:45:40,100
Apocalyptic.

3845
02:45:40,580 --> 02:45:40,880
What?

3846
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:42,020
That is so, like...

3847
02:45:43,220 --> 02:45:44,060
What does that mean?

3848
02:45:44,160 --> 02:45:44,780
The end of the world.

3849
02:45:44,780 --> 02:45:47,980
I guess explosions and monsters and corpses.

3850
02:45:48,420 --> 02:45:50,860
Yeah, but how is that worse than Darwin Awards?

3851
02:45:52,360 --> 02:45:55,040
Because you have to put yourself in danger for Darwin Awards.

3852
02:45:55,320 --> 02:45:55,920
Yeah, but, like...

3853
02:45:55,920 --> 02:45:56,980
Oh, do you want that flashlight?

3854
02:45:57,120 --> 02:45:57,420
Here you go.

3855
02:45:58,000 --> 02:45:58,800
Oh, thank you.

3856
02:45:58,860 --> 02:46:00,900
Sorry, I couldn't get your helmet because I had...

3857
02:46:00,900 --> 02:46:01,800
Yeah, no, no.

3858
02:46:01,800 --> 02:46:02,320
You're good.

3859
02:46:02,520 --> 02:46:02,880
We're so good, we don't die.

3860
02:46:02,880 --> 02:46:04,940
I can probably do, like, one more.

3861
02:46:05,300 --> 02:46:05,660
Alright.

3862
02:46:06,020 --> 02:46:06,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3863
02:46:06,620 --> 02:46:08,020
Let's finish this, guys.

3864
02:46:08,020 --> 02:46:10,260
As fellow journalists...

3865
02:46:10,260 --> 02:46:12,360
As long as someone gets out with, like, two photos, we win.

3866
02:46:12,840 --> 02:46:15,120
Yeah, we can... We don't have to be super risky here.

3867
02:46:15,200 --> 02:46:15,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3868
02:46:16,280 --> 02:46:18,020
I mean, it's, uh... We can find the...

3869
02:46:18,580 --> 02:46:19,120
What was it?

3870
02:46:19,120 --> 02:46:20,040
The little doggies, right?

3871
02:46:26,180 --> 02:46:29,020
Guys, we're one day off of retirement, guys.

3872
02:46:29,780 --> 02:46:31,260
Oh, yeah, we're one day off of retirement.

3873
02:46:31,780 --> 02:46:32,780
Oh, and then we can, like, do...

3874
02:46:32,780 --> 02:46:35,220
If we pass this, we can do the later levels with Snuffy.

3875
02:46:35,600 --> 02:46:36,460
The final level.

3876
02:46:37,880 --> 02:46:39,380
Yeah, we'll save progress, I think.

3877
02:46:40,240 --> 02:46:45,600
Man, I sure can't wait to finish my job as a journalist and go spend the rest of my days with my family.

3878
02:46:46,480 --> 02:46:47,500
In and out super safe.

3879
02:46:47,620 --> 02:46:48,420
There'll be no problems.

3880
02:46:48,700 --> 02:46:49,880
There'll never be...

3881
02:46:49,880 --> 02:46:51,560
Not a single problem.

3882
02:46:51,880 --> 02:46:55,080
...better thing than to go retire in the Bahamas.

3883
02:46:56,800 --> 02:46:57,640
The Bahamas.

3884
02:46:58,120 --> 02:46:59,180
The Bahamas.

3885
02:47:00,040 --> 02:47:01,780
Do you wanna go to this building over here?

3886
02:47:01,820 --> 02:47:02,760
Let's go to that building.

3887
02:47:03,180 --> 02:47:03,520
Yeah.

3888
02:47:03,900 --> 02:47:06,260
It's closer to the jump skip, too.

3889
02:47:07,200 --> 02:47:07,700
True, true.

3890
02:47:08,320 --> 02:47:10,680
These rivals are always...

3891
02:47:10,680 --> 02:47:13,480
They're always really close, but I don't think they're actually anywhere.

3892
02:47:14,740 --> 02:47:15,500
The doki skip.

3893
02:47:19,520 --> 02:47:22,500
The basic fucking crouch jump art.

3894
02:47:23,180 --> 02:47:25,080
Aw, man, we're in this building again.

3895
02:47:25,560 --> 02:47:26,820
Oh, there's a trap here?

3896
02:47:27,220 --> 02:47:30,080
Yeah, but I invented it, though.

3897
02:47:30,620 --> 02:47:32,000
You invented crouch jumping?

3898
02:47:32,120 --> 02:47:32,780
That's crazy.

3899
02:47:32,980 --> 02:47:35,300
Yeah, but I invented it in this game.

3900
02:47:35,300 --> 02:47:36,460
Okay, okay.

3901
02:47:37,200 --> 02:47:38,780
But wait, before you do...

3902
02:47:38,780 --> 02:47:39,540
Okay, yeah, yeah, I'm ready.

3903
02:47:40,600 --> 02:47:42,000
Doki, take a pose in front.

3904
02:47:42,460 --> 02:47:43,400
Yeah, that's what I'm doing.

3905
02:47:45,620 --> 02:47:47,040
I'm dying, I'm dying.

3906
02:47:47,180 --> 02:47:48,320
You're fine, I got you.

3907
02:47:48,960 --> 02:47:49,660
Oh, shoot.

3908
02:47:51,600 --> 02:47:52,680
Careful, careful, careful!

3909
02:47:52,840 --> 02:47:53,880
Oh, you are so dead.

3910
02:47:58,360 --> 02:47:59,160
I'm alive.

3911
02:48:00,220 --> 02:48:01,260
I don't think Mint's alive.

3912
02:48:01,440 --> 02:48:02,640
Oh, you're good, you're good.

3913
02:48:02,640 --> 02:48:03,860
Oh, she's alive, too!

3914
02:48:06,280 --> 02:48:07,380
Oh, my God.

3915
02:48:08,200 --> 02:48:10,180
That was... Okay, we basically got the photo.

3916
02:48:10,300 --> 02:48:11,780
I got 733 points from that.

3917
02:48:12,120 --> 02:48:12,920
I gamed, I gamed!

3918
02:48:12,920 --> 02:48:14,960
I got 1,200 fucking points.

3919
02:48:15,040 --> 02:48:16,100
Alright, let's go, let's leave.

3920
02:48:16,300 --> 02:48:17,440
We did it, we did our job.

3921
02:48:17,480 --> 02:48:18,100
Yeah, we did it, we did it.

3922
02:48:18,100 --> 02:48:19,240
We did it.

3923
02:48:20,140 --> 02:48:21,360
I gamed, I gamed!

3924
02:48:21,620 --> 02:48:24,180
I got gamer of the year right there.

3925
02:48:25,640 --> 02:48:26,440
Holy shit.

3926
02:48:26,900 --> 02:48:28,620
That was pretty easy.

3927
02:48:28,620 --> 02:48:29,180
Watch out, watch out!

3928
02:48:30,580 --> 02:48:31,900
Tiny man, tiny man.

3929
02:48:33,720 --> 02:48:35,520
Oh no, not the doki skip.

3930
02:48:36,040 --> 02:48:37,300
He's in front of the doki skip.

3931
02:48:37,580 --> 02:48:38,860
He's guarding the doki skip, what a dick.

3932
02:48:42,020 --> 02:48:44,160
If I die, you have to get my camera.

3933
02:48:44,320 --> 02:48:45,620
This is a very, very...

3934
02:48:45,620 --> 02:48:48,260
I got the apocalypse scenario in it.

3935
02:48:48,500 --> 02:48:49,340
Oh, you got the apocalypse?

3936
02:48:49,980 --> 02:48:51,480
I got apocalypse, yeah.

3937
02:48:54,060 --> 02:48:55,480
Okay, let's see if I can make this.

3938
02:48:55,780 --> 02:48:56,960
I did it last time, first try.

3939
02:48:57,220 --> 02:48:59,080
I did it, I did it.

3940
02:48:59,280 --> 02:48:59,620
Nice.

3941
02:49:03,940 --> 02:49:05,220
Alright, it's time to go.

3942
02:49:07,100 --> 02:49:09,660
But what if we waited for the giant monster?

3943
02:49:10,200 --> 02:49:12,340
We could just wait up here, nothing gets us here.

3944
02:49:13,500 --> 02:49:14,400
Yeah, I guess.

3945
02:49:14,880 --> 02:49:16,120
Like, we already saw that monster.

3946
02:49:16,460 --> 02:49:16,920
Why don't we just wait by the helicopter?

3947
02:49:17,440 --> 02:49:19,960
Yeah, that's true, we can wait by it and exit it when he shows up.

3948
02:49:20,440 --> 02:49:22,160
But one of us has to stay outside.

3949
02:49:24,300 --> 02:49:25,700
You actually went into the helicopter?

3950
02:49:25,720 --> 02:49:26,140
Not me.

3951
02:49:29,060 --> 02:49:31,200
Okay, but if I die, get my camera.

3952
02:49:33,180 --> 02:49:34,740
Oh, there's a guy over there.

3953
02:49:40,040 --> 02:49:43,080
There he is, there's a little guy over there.

3954
02:49:45,220 --> 02:49:46,580
You heard that too, right?

3955
02:49:46,940 --> 02:49:47,760
He's coming over.

3956
02:49:48,160 --> 02:49:48,960
He is coming over.

3957
02:49:49,500 --> 02:49:50,600
He won't get us.

3958
02:49:51,140 --> 02:49:54,080
We might have to leave if he doesn't stop walking towards us.

3959
02:49:54,260 --> 02:49:55,840
He's like hobbling over towards us.

3960
02:49:55,880 --> 02:49:57,280
Oh, he doesn't see you, he's blind.

3961
02:49:57,640 --> 02:49:58,480
He's nearsighted.

3962
02:49:58,480 --> 02:50:03,460
Why can I hear like ambient Jurassic Park noises?

3963
02:50:04,020 --> 02:50:06,480
Oh, you're right, I hear that too.

3964
02:50:09,560 --> 02:50:12,480
Because they're all around us, we're just...

3965
02:50:14,060 --> 02:50:15,180
Come on!

3966
02:50:15,920 --> 02:50:16,160
Hey!

3967
02:50:16,980 --> 02:50:18,160
Big guy!

3968
02:50:19,080 --> 02:50:20,720
There's no one behind us, so...

3969
02:50:21,640 --> 02:50:22,420
Oh my god.

3970
02:50:22,860 --> 02:50:24,720
It really is super Jurassic Park.

3971
02:50:26,060 --> 02:50:29,000
I feel like I'm in the Jurassic World park ride.

3972
02:50:29,640 --> 02:50:32,720
Here it comes!

3973
02:50:32,800 --> 02:50:33,420
There's the explosion!

3974
02:50:33,720 --> 02:50:34,200
Camera's ready!

3975
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:39,380
Does the red light mean that's... Oh my fucking god!

3976
02:50:40,380 --> 02:50:45,400
Oh, you don't get points from doing that in the plane, I just noticed.

3977
02:50:46,040 --> 02:50:47,700
I just got an even better photo, 1300.

3978
02:50:48,320 --> 02:50:50,020
Oh, I got a 1201.

3979
02:50:50,940 --> 02:50:51,480
Yeah.

3980
02:50:52,180 --> 02:50:55,940
It was for taking shot of those explosions with you in the foreground.

3981
02:50:56,220 --> 02:50:57,880
Yeah, yeah, me too, I got that too.

3982
02:51:08,760 --> 02:51:11,220
The helicopter guy's so chill about this.

3983
02:51:11,800 --> 02:51:13,340
Just another day on the job.

3984
02:51:14,240 --> 02:51:15,760
I'm ready for Slenderman.

3985
02:51:20,020 --> 02:51:20,440
What?

3986
02:51:22,820 --> 02:51:28,020
I got bravery for standing far away from the photo.

3987
02:51:29,820 --> 02:51:31,120
Okay, I'll wave.

3988
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:32,860
Number three.

3989
02:51:33,780 --> 02:51:34,040
Hello!

3990
02:51:34,720 --> 02:51:35,580
I'm gonna fist pump.

3991
02:51:40,540 --> 02:51:43,280
Oh, it's a different one!

3992
02:51:44,080 --> 02:51:44,920
Oh, it's a tornado.

3993
02:51:45,280 --> 02:51:45,800
It's a tornado.

3994
02:51:50,480 --> 02:51:51,360
Hmm, hello.

3995
02:51:51,580 --> 02:51:52,740
Can you strike a pose for me?

3996
02:51:53,360 --> 02:51:54,140
Thank you.

3997
02:51:54,760 --> 02:51:56,100
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, okay.

3998
02:51:57,340 --> 02:51:59,620
Oh wow, you're trying to maximize it.

3999
02:52:02,680 --> 02:52:06,380
Oh, we already got it.

4000
02:52:08,020 --> 02:52:08,860
There we go.

4001
02:52:09,580 --> 02:52:12,760
I'm hoping that he explodes something, because it'll probably give us extra points.

4002
02:52:13,180 --> 02:52:13,660
That's true.

4003
02:52:13,680 --> 02:52:14,840
It is kind of right now.

4004
02:52:16,300 --> 02:52:18,260
Oh, there's a club there too.

4005
02:52:18,900 --> 02:52:19,640
Oh, he's coming.

4006
02:52:19,840 --> 02:52:20,840
He's coming to the club.

4007
02:52:21,160 --> 02:52:21,320
Alright.

4008
02:52:21,580 --> 02:52:23,080
Toki is so bad.

4009
02:52:23,420 --> 02:52:25,320
He's already in the fucking helicopter.

4010
02:52:26,280 --> 02:52:27,980
You said he's coming, so I ran!

4011
02:52:30,640 --> 02:52:33,340
I heard the instructions clear as day.

4012
02:52:34,360 --> 02:52:36,900
Let's see what happens if he gets sucked into the tornado.

4013
02:52:37,600 --> 02:52:39,680
Give this journalist a medal of bravery.

4014
02:52:40,200 --> 02:52:41,800
Give me a purple heart right there.

4015
02:52:42,080 --> 02:52:43,300
Oh, what the heck?

4016
02:52:44,240 --> 02:52:45,840
That's why I'm the only survivor.

4017
02:52:46,880 --> 02:52:48,840
We all survived, what are you talking about?

4018
02:52:50,440 --> 02:52:51,260
Alright, let's see.

4019
02:52:51,340 --> 02:52:52,820
I'm pretty sure Lime got the best photo.

4020
02:52:53,060 --> 02:52:53,660
She got the 1300.

4021
02:52:53,940 --> 02:52:55,560
Yeah, Lime's award winning photo.

4022
02:52:55,600 --> 02:52:58,100
Yeah, the award winning photo right there.

4023
02:52:58,560 --> 02:53:01,760
Oh yeah, that one.

4024
02:53:04,680 --> 02:53:06,720
Mine was apparently just that much cooler.

4025
02:53:07,300 --> 02:53:08,900
I can't believe I...

4026
02:53:08,900 --> 02:53:10,480
Oh, that was cool.

4027
02:53:10,580 --> 02:53:11,720
That one was cool.

4028
02:53:12,660 --> 02:53:14,580
Oh, I look awesome!

4029
02:53:14,580 --> 02:53:16,760
Mine's got fire in it though, so...

4030
02:53:17,740 --> 02:53:19,280
Yeah, better photo.

4031
02:53:20,300 --> 02:53:22,020
We did it!

4032
02:53:22,620 --> 02:53:23,080
Yay!

4033
02:53:23,660 --> 02:53:24,640
Alright, guys.

4034
02:53:25,320 --> 02:53:26,700
Look at my headliner here.

4035
02:53:26,860 --> 02:53:29,080
That's actually a really cool photo though.

4036
02:53:29,460 --> 02:53:30,340
It is actually.

4037
02:53:31,720 --> 02:53:34,640
It's not a fucking selfie, no one is.

4038
02:53:37,300 --> 02:53:40,080
So our photos went...

4039
02:53:40,080 --> 02:53:42,380
Mint doing something real sus with a monster.

4040
02:53:42,620 --> 02:53:43,960
An actually cool photo.

4041
02:53:43,960 --> 02:53:45,360
Monster clutch.

4042
02:53:45,600 --> 02:53:46,100
Selfie.

4043
02:53:46,200 --> 02:53:46,640
Selfie.

4044
02:53:46,740 --> 02:53:47,940
Actually cool photo.

4045
02:53:48,500 --> 02:53:54,680
This actually looks like something I can see in a newspaper.

4046
02:53:55,680 --> 02:53:58,940
It actually has some form of composition going on.

4047
02:54:01,680 --> 02:54:03,560
Oh yeah, how do I save this shit?

4048
02:54:03,820 --> 02:54:06,360
I can submit this at the start of my journalism career.

4049
02:54:06,580 --> 02:54:07,060
Oh, here we go.

4050
02:54:07,720 --> 02:54:09,140
Rule of thirds, baby!

4051
02:54:09,680 --> 02:54:10,620
Oh my god.

4052
02:54:10,900 --> 02:54:12,000
I can't believe it.

4053
02:54:12,120 --> 02:54:12,760
We did it.

4054
02:54:12,760 --> 02:54:14,940
We learned how to be real journalists.

4055
02:54:15,700 --> 02:54:16,140
Yay!

4056
02:54:17,920 --> 02:54:20,280
I can't wait to show Snuffy when she gets a new CPU.

4057
02:54:20,760 --> 02:54:24,800
Oh yeah, we'll continue our run and get to level 5 with Snuffy.

4058
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:26,540
Hell yeah.

4059
02:54:27,320 --> 02:54:28,940
That's the trial by fucking fire.

4060
02:54:29,040 --> 02:54:33,060
It's like, hey Snuffy, go into this building and she gets mogged by a headcrab or something.

4061
02:54:33,280 --> 02:54:34,480
We're like one last...

4062
02:54:34,480 --> 02:54:36,920
We all come back for one last heist.

4063
02:54:37,440 --> 02:54:38,320
As reporters.

4064
02:54:39,540 --> 02:54:40,100
Oh yeah.

4065
02:54:46,800 --> 02:54:47,260
Yeah.

4066
02:54:47,900 --> 02:54:49,560
Oh yeah, there's you hanging.

4067
02:54:50,760 --> 02:54:51,680
Jesus Christ.

4068
02:54:52,080 --> 02:54:52,900
Oh wow.

4069
02:54:54,240 --> 02:54:56,360
There's me dancing next to it too.

4070
02:54:56,540 --> 02:54:57,120
I'll be like, yeah.

4071
02:54:58,480 --> 02:54:59,680
You're not even like...

4072
02:54:59,680 --> 02:55:00,820
What is this photo?

4073
02:55:01,820 --> 02:55:03,420
You're not even in that photo.

4074
02:55:04,540 --> 02:55:07,800
You look like you're not a journalist.

4075
02:55:07,980 --> 02:55:09,700
You're like actually going at the paparazzi.

4076
02:55:09,720 --> 02:55:10,220
Oh, you're right.

4077
02:55:10,300 --> 02:55:10,900
It's like, no photos!

4078
02:55:10,900 --> 02:55:11,620
No photos!

4079
02:55:12,020 --> 02:55:12,060
Yeah.

4080
02:55:14,320 --> 02:55:16,460
It's like when Jake Paul goes to the forest.

4081
02:55:16,480 --> 02:55:17,460
Protecting Mint's privacy.

4082
02:55:20,780 --> 02:55:21,920
Oh my god.

4083
02:55:24,960 --> 02:55:25,560
What's this?

4084
02:55:25,680 --> 02:55:25,860
Oh yeah.

4085
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:27,720
Oh, this is where we did the explosions.

4086
02:55:28,620 --> 02:55:29,520
What the fuck is that?

4087
02:55:29,600 --> 02:55:31,820
Oh, it's the guy that comes out.

4088
02:55:32,300 --> 02:55:32,960
It's the guy.

4089
02:55:33,060 --> 02:55:33,900
I saw him in there.

4090
02:55:34,720 --> 02:55:35,600
Me taking a selfie.

4091
02:55:35,880 --> 02:55:36,160
Yeah.

4092
02:55:36,160 --> 02:55:36,600
Wow.

4093
02:55:39,400 --> 02:55:40,200
GGs, guys.

4094
02:55:40,640 --> 02:55:43,700
It was a great pleasure being journalists with all of you.

4095
02:55:44,020 --> 02:55:45,820
Yeah, I had a great time.

4096
02:55:46,420 --> 02:55:47,400
We should have a selfie.

4097
02:55:47,600 --> 02:55:48,320
How did this photo not get a bigger score?

4098
02:55:48,380 --> 02:55:48,900
Look at that shit.

4099
02:55:49,000 --> 02:55:50,020
Let's get a selfie together.

4100
02:55:50,320 --> 02:55:51,080
One last photo.

4101
02:55:51,340 --> 02:55:51,900
Oh yeah, okay, okay.

4102
02:55:51,900 --> 02:55:52,700
Oh, one last selfie.

4103
02:55:53,200 --> 02:55:54,980
We should all do a selfie together.

4104
02:55:55,760 --> 02:55:56,080
Okay.

4105
02:55:57,780 --> 02:55:58,180
Okay, wait.

4106
02:55:59,620 --> 02:56:00,640
Wait, how does this work?

4107
02:56:00,840 --> 02:56:01,740
How do we get together?

4108
02:56:01,920 --> 02:56:02,280
Crouch.

4109
02:56:04,160 --> 02:56:05,060
Oh, there we go, there we go.

4110
02:56:05,060 --> 02:56:06,220
Oh my god, wait.

4111
02:56:08,960 --> 02:56:10,240
Oh wait, no, not like that.

4112
02:56:10,340 --> 02:56:10,680
Oh shit.

4113
02:56:11,200 --> 02:56:12,240
I'm trying to A, I'm trying to A.

4114
02:56:12,240 --> 02:56:13,300
Oh, I'm trying to A too.

4115
02:56:21,980 --> 02:56:24,100
One last photo for the ride.

4116
02:56:27,910 --> 02:56:28,710
It's beautiful.

4117
02:56:28,950 --> 02:56:30,490
I love that you guys still have your safety helmets on.

4118
02:56:34,310 --> 02:56:35,490
Yeah, we're special.

4119
02:56:36,730 --> 02:56:37,150
Hell yeah.

4120
02:56:37,870 --> 02:56:38,890
GG's everyone.

4121
02:56:39,550 --> 02:56:41,150
Thanks for playing Headliners.

4122
02:56:42,290 --> 02:56:43,590
It was a lot of fun.

4123
02:56:43,650 --> 02:56:46,350
Let's hope we can get Snuffy in next time.

4124
02:56:46,710 --> 02:56:47,130
Hell yeah.

4125
02:56:47,410 --> 02:56:48,290
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4126
02:56:48,490 --> 02:56:51,890
Let's hope Snuffy's PC...

4127
02:56:51,890 --> 02:56:52,830
Yeah, I feel better, both of you.

4128
02:56:53,010 --> 02:56:58,010
Yeah, I'm gonna rest my voice right after this, but GG's guys, GG's.

4129
02:56:58,470 --> 02:57:00,250
Let's hope Snuffy's PC will be okay.

4130
02:57:01,270 --> 02:57:01,630
I know.

4131
02:57:01,950 --> 02:57:03,290
Alright, bye bye.

4132
02:57:04,290 --> 02:57:04,970
Bye bye.

4133
02:57:05,270 --> 02:57:05,830
Bye.

4134
02:57:05,830 --> 02:57:07,010
Oh, oh.

4135
02:57:07,750 --> 02:57:08,250
Bye.

4136
02:57:09,210 --> 02:57:09,710
Bye.

4137
02:57:11,540 --> 02:57:12,720
Alright, bye to you too.

4138
02:57:12,940 --> 02:57:13,160
Bye.

4139
02:57:15,880 --> 02:57:17,080
Alright, guys.

4140
02:57:17,340 --> 02:57:18,000
Look at that.

4141
02:57:18,640 --> 02:57:19,380
We did it.

4142
02:57:20,100 --> 02:57:21,000
I love that.

4143
02:57:22,160 --> 02:57:23,540
Oh, I'm in Disconnect.

4144
02:57:23,700 --> 02:57:25,200
That's to show you guys my Headliners.

4145
02:57:25,800 --> 02:57:27,540
But, yeah, that was a fun game.

4146
02:57:27,980 --> 02:57:33,120
I'm sorry I can't talk for too long because my voice has made it to its final end.

4147
02:57:33,800 --> 02:57:36,680
Tomorrow's sponsor is Nikkei.

4148
02:57:36,680 --> 02:57:45,560
We are going to be looking into the Evangelion collaboration that's launching today slash tomorrow.

4149
02:57:46,100 --> 02:57:47,700
So that is our sponsor for tomorrow.

4150
02:57:48,460 --> 02:57:50,500
Everything's finalized, so I can announce it now.

4151
02:57:51,280 --> 02:57:52,800
But I'm gonna rest my voice now.

4152
02:57:53,040 --> 02:57:53,900
My voice is dead.

4153
02:57:54,800 --> 02:57:56,360
As always, everybody, stay hydrated.

4154
02:57:56,600 --> 02:57:57,020
Posture check.

4155
02:57:57,340 --> 02:57:58,860
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

4156
02:57:59,000 --> 02:58:02,020
And if you stay up for me, head to bed because you deserve it.

4157
02:58:02,380 --> 02:58:03,620
I'm gonna rest now.

4158
02:58:03,840 --> 02:58:04,600
I'll see you guys.

4159
02:58:04,840 --> 02:58:05,480
Bye, everyone.

4160
02:58:06,080 --> 02:58:06,520
Bye.

4161
02:58:06,740 --> 02:58:09,840
I hate doing that off the head, but I legitimately can't talk anymore.

4162
02:58:11,040 --> 02:58:11,880
Alright, everybody.

4163
02:58:12,100 --> 02:58:12,420
Bye.
