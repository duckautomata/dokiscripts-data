1
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:35,050
Good morning everyone.

2
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,210
I am alive.

3
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:49,390
I would like to say that technically I'm not late.

4
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:58,190
We made up looped three times, but we started the stream on time.

5
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:08,150
So technically, I arrived on time.

6
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,740
I can't help it.

7
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:18,860
I keep thinking, like, there's a day I will win the nap.

8
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:19,620
Gotcha.

9
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,200
I was like, oh, the bed looks so comfy, dog.

10
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:28,760
I'm like, oh, look at this bed.

11
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,720
It's so comfy.

12
00:06:33,880 --> 00:07:21,820
hour nap that that won't hurt anybody but it does it hurts me hurts me so much i've waited a whole year for this thank you for the akasupa cranberry thank you thank you i really appreciate yes it's been a whole year i think i think it was a arkham asylum was the game I first series I did when I came back so um happy okay the anniversary might be a little late but happy anniversary welcome back Batman oh my god Batman

13
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:33,040
happy anniversary it's almost two years that's true that's true we're rounding up like a pussy

14
00:07:36,120 --> 00:08:04,500
but it is good to be back in the batman series um i'm looking forward to it i heard arkham city was an improvement to arkham asylum um which is like you know it's it's something that um is very rare these days to have well not these days this game came out 10 years ago by the way um yes we're all getting older nothing stops the march of time but any Anyway,

15
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:12,200
but it's hard for the sequels to be better than the original because that's like the hardest thing a game do.

16
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:18,000
And it's even funnier when, um, uh, okay, but then I heard what was the third game?

17
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,420
The third game was also better.

18
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,880
It was also really, really good.

19
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:25,520
And then it all went downhill and we don't acknowledge anything else that happened to this franchise.

20
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,760
But anyway, uh, uh, Tracomation, thank you.

21
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,920
Welcome to Tomato Farm.

22
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,860
Welcome, welcome.

23
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:31,960
Uh, where are you?

24
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,640
Thank you for the Magenta Super?

25
00:08:33,880 --> 00:09:30,760
thank you thank you hi everybody hi dr nick um anyway anyway let's get started um also that update i talked about this in the member stream but um i got my very first noise complaint today i got really scared because i was like oh my god like it's because i stream sometimes i stream sometimes yes sometimes um just a little hobby that i do but like it's because like i get really loud during my stream but no it's because of dad um thank god because it wasn't me um i got really scared but at least it but i found that it wasn't me um but uh he just like basically he was barking a lot at 10 in the morning and um i try not to like enable him this by this enable his behavior by ignoring him.

26
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,040
You know?

27
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,900
So like, so he doesn't get his way.

28
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:49,180
So the concierge called me and was like, uh, uh, hello, uh, I'm calling you because then your neighbors are complaining about your dog barking really, really loud.

29
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:54,920
And obviously I lied in these types of situations.

30
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,280
And was like, oh, I'm so sorry.

31
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,260
I was asleep.

32
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:05,080
So like, he must have been trying to wake me up.

33
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,200
And I didn't know.

34
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,280
So, yeah, obviously I lied and said, I don't have a dog.

35
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:15,000
But unfortunately, she was apparently knocking at my door.

36
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,520
And dad was barking at the door while she was doing that.

37
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:23,500
So, unfortunately, I kept being like, what dog?

38
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,280
Instead, she'd be like, oh, there's a dog.

39
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,140
Oh, then she'll be like, oh my god, are we haunted?

40
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,740
A ghost dog, yeah.

41
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:39,100
And then the concierge will be like, oh my god, a ghost dog.

42
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:43,180
But yes, I got my very first noise complaint today.

43
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,220
So that's unfortunate because I said this on stream.

44
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:54,440
But like, you know, I did say I want to move soon, like sooner slash one day.

45
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,920
But I want to leave on my terms.

46
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:01,360
And so, so I don't want to get kicked out.

47
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,980
I'm trying to leave on my terms here.

48
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,880
So I'm, so I already, I got strike one.

49
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:15,200
So I'm a little worried now because like, because now my neighbors are finally complaining.

50
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,960
Yeah, I'm going to leave on dad's turn.

51
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:27,280
Anyway, other than that, I also have a little small announcement.

52
00:11:27,300 --> 00:13:03,780
uh regarding some merch stuff um I know I saved I saved the file no I did not give me a sec I was told by my man reminded why so my manager to to talk about this um and I almost forgot because I was I was eeping but uh we are doing a I also I pinned the message too so you guys it's not really an announcement like I already sort of told you guys what it is but last call for wave one of the dokey blade merch yes that means uh you can still pre-order the dokey blade stuff um and it'll be we're doing a last call uh and it's gonna the pre-orders will close on wednesday so yes you want to get your stuff in time we'll uh make sure to pre-order it before wednesday and i pinned the link in chat i mean i can still i still copy and paste it give me a sec oh my god type doki blade when it's just bite ramen yeah so we're doing a final call for pre-order so make sure to grab yourself before it's gone gone all right hashtag add over so we're finally gonna go back to Batman Arkham City welcome back

53
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:48,100
Batman you guys hear about the what's called the absolute series from Batman and they made Joker like buff as fuck because they're like wow why does because like the whole thing about absolute Batman is that he too is also buff at buff as hell but so they're like what kind of villains with absolute batman fight if he is so fucking jacked up and because it's like you know if we fight regular joker um if he fights regular joker he can literally squish joker with his thumb so so they're like i don't know we know what to do we're gonna make joker a buff ass monster

54
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:59,040
So, we're going to make all the villains buff as hell if they're going to fight Batman.

55
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,880
Yeah, for those who know, absolute Batman is like a fucking rectangle.

56
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,340
I'll show you guys before I boot up the game.

57
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,920
Yes, I know a lot about DC, because I'm actually a DC fan girl.

58
00:14:11,940 --> 00:15:23,660
Also, for those who are wondering why his fucking Batman logo looks stupid as fuck, I'll show you guys the context of like I'll show you guys the image and I'll explain the Lord yes I know my DC Lord I'm a DC gal even though I play Marvel Rivals um I always been DC first because I love their comics and the they're animated so this is absolute Batman um it's a new it's a new comic series that they're doing and apparently it's like um it's really really good um and his Batman logo you're like that fucking logo looks stupid as I I agree I do agree with you but there is so there is it is it's so like they gave us the reason but I still think it looks fucking stupid but it's based off his axe so it's Batman holding a giant fucking axe so and they're like I'm gonna put that logo and I'm gonna use that as my fucking logo so um they basically jacked up not just Batman but all his other villains because I guess that's the only way to make sense as to why he's fucking struggling against the

59
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:44,980
other villains like like they're like I guess that makes sense like we're like how the fuck is he losing to villains if he's like this jacked up so they jacked up all the other villains and shit so these are this is what they look like now so there's a demon joker uh big ah bane So even,

60
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:55,940
you know how Bain's whole thing is that he's fucking, you know, he's big as fuck and he's like, his entire body is filled with like, I don't know, like cocaine or some shit.

61
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:02,780
Like, his entire body is filled with like, you know, drugs and everything.

62
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,920
But now they gave him more drugs.

63
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:11,460
They gave him, basically, they gave him more drugs.

64
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,760
So like, he's even crazier now.

65
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,860
So, welcome to the Absolute series.

66
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,260
Yeah, yeah, so it's pain, but, like, bigger now.

67
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,740
Yeah, so, like, all the villains are just a lot bigger and scarier.

68
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,120
Thank you for the super chat.

69
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,180
Thank you, thank you.

70
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,280
Yeah, Batman, you can graduate.

71
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,760
You don't need to fight them.

72
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,700
Thank you for the super chat.

73
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,140
Thank you, thank you.

74
00:16:44,540 --> 00:17:14,500
I kind of like that though So So that's the Absolute Batman series Okay also another comic that I recently finished reading I don't remember the Like some of you comic nerds can like Tell me the comic name But it was one where it's about like The zombie It's sort of like Marvel Like Marvel zombies But they had a similar premise in the DC It was so good I highly recommend checking it out Um,

75
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:23,740
it's the one where, uh, there's like a computer virus or something, um, in the DC universe, and, like, basically the entire world is infected.

76
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:32,780
Um, no, it's not, it's not the song, is it DC's the one where the entire world was infected by this computer virus that's causing people to kill each other.

77
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:39,580
And it's also, um, affecting, uh, yeah, it's the anti-life, it was regarded to the anti-life equation.

78
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,040
Is it DCs?

79
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,580
I highly recommend checking that series out.

80
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,640
It's so good.

81
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:51,860
I was like, I think I spent like the entire like, uh, entire day like reading through it.

82
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,740
I'm going to double check just to be sure.

83
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,960
Because like, I don't know, maybe you're lying.

84
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:05,380
Yeah, it's, it was like, um, um, it was like about the anti-life equation.

85
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,480
It was so interesting.

86
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:09,560
Basically, like, even the superheroes were infected.

87
00:18:09,580 --> 00:19:22,540
as well and they were trying to I'm just gonna double check if this is the one I'm thinking of uh yeah it is it's so good it's actually I would um I would highly recommend checking it out because I normally don't like say a lot of praise about like certain comic series um yeah I mean I would say praise but I would not link it be like you should check it out or something like that um but like the DC comic series from DC is so fucking good because I literally spent the entire day um entire day just reading the entire series because uh um I was just I was just like hooked in because I was like oh my god what the fuck is gonna happen next yes I will say it's much better I it I didn't want I don't know I don't really know much about the Marvel zombies franchise but like I think it was definitely like it was a very good read um so bro like like like Bain's like chest like it feels like he has like two like John ass man boobs I'm sorry I just now process how fucking ridiculous this looks

88
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:40,000
absolute Batman is not rich however uh demon Joker thank you for the super chat monster thank you thank you um but stop thank you for the super chat thank you thank Thank you.

89
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,360
The Absolute Series has done crazy stuff.

90
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:46,540
Batman spat his teeth out and vomited some acid to try to escape imprisonment.

91
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,860
Also, that's Bane without Venom.

92
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,360
He gets bigger.

93
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:50,740
Okay.

94
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:54,840
I did not know that because I have not caught up with the Absolute Series.

95
00:19:55,260 --> 00:20:02,400
I just know like little bits and pieces because people were like, holy fuck, because the Vintlands get like crazier and crazier.

96
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,540
So apparently, yeah.

97
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:03,840
Okay.

98
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:07,860
I didn't even know that I was Bane without his goddamn Venom.

00:20:09,580 --> 00:21:28,960
percent venom um that's like crazy uh but yeah i didn't give him the super chat thank you thing oh he gets okay how big does he get absolute absolute bane like people were making fun of the absolute batman design but we were but then like they read the series and was like holy fuck wait this shit fucking slaps i still haven't read really read the absolute series because um I don't know I don't have an excuse it's just because I did it like because I don't know I can't get over his design so I guess I never try to I never try to read it I just couldn't get over his stupid ass logo but I understand the whole premise I just it's just a logo I have to get over that uh i just it's just holy shit holy shit all right guys you remember how we saw uh how we saw how buff batman was um yeah that doesn't matter i was like where's batman i was like oh shit i mean that's not that big and i see him holding batman and i was like oh shit Wait,

129
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,560
What the fuck, Batman?

130
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,380
Batman!

131
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,320
Hello!

132
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,760
Searching for download.

133
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,980
I might have to do, like...

134
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,260
Uh...

135
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,740
Oh my god, Batman.

136
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,240
I might have to do, like...

137
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:48,920
Um...

138
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:52,620
Uh, not full screen to see if it fucking detects it.

139
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:56,700
Okay.

140
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,760
Let me reboot the game.

141
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:02,820
Because my OBS is like, where's the game?

142
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,660
And I'm like, what do you mean where's the game?

143
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:05,440
It's right there.

144
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,360
I'm looking at it right now.

145
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,660
He's sneaking around somewhere.

146
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,960
Okay, let's escape.

147
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:16,980
Searching for...

148
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,240
Okay, if I click the save file, is it going to automatically...

149
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,740
Is it automatically going to play the game?

150
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,640
I hope not.

151
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,360
I can't close...

152
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:26,940
I can't force...

153
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,320
Okay, I don't know if I should force close the game.

154
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:30,980
Alright.

155
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,740
Oh, there we go.

156
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,040
Oh, shit.

157
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,340
This looks so weird.

158
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:35,860
All right.

159
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,020
Adjust gameplay.

160
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:37,740
There we go.

161
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:38,420
All right.

162
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,160
Never mind.

163
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:45,340
Uh, it seems to me that... Wait, no, I don't need to test the PC's benchmark.

164
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,040
I actually press test the PC's benchmark.

165
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:50,340
So it's running a benchmark test right now.

166
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,940
I... It's ready.

167
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,440
It's like these are the amount of frames you're gonna get.

168
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,860
I'm like, thank you.

169
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,440
All right, let's see if it shows up yet.

170
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:01,220
No, it still does.

171
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:01,880
doesn't show up.

172
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,380
That's so fucking weird.

173
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,960
Alright, I think I actually have to force quit this game.

174
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,080
Um...

175
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,240
Let me force quit it real quick.

176
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,700
Alright, goodbye, Batman.

177
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,020
I'm done playing with you.

178
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,620
Goodbye, Batman!

179
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,400
Alright, uh, Zan here.

180
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,900
Zan here, thank you for the super chat.

181
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:24,120
Thank you.

182
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:24,740
Thank you.

183
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,580
Hello, Doki.

184
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,000
It is I, the Riddler.

185
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:31,220
I've hidden the answer to your tech issues in a hundred statues within ten miles.

186
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:31,940
of you.

187
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,780
All right, what's the cheat code?

188
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,060
I require the cheat code right now.

189
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,680
All right, let's see if I... I'll just do it.

190
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,140
Oh, fuck, I have to boot it.

191
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:43,860
Are you serious?

192
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,440
You gotta boot it up as...

193
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,700
Oh, my god.

194
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:48,820
Okay, never mind.

195
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,000
I gotta force quit Batman again.

196
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,160
All right, Batman.

197
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,160
Goodbye, Batman.

198
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:53,900
Yet again.

199
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,560
End task.

200
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,120
Because you're supposed to just click PC options.

201
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:00,760
All right.

202
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,840
configure PC options.

203
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,640
I gotta make it windowed or something.

204
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,440
So my fucking OBS detects it.

205
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,860
It is so annoying.

206
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,660
I hope it detects it.

207
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,500
Uh, okay.

208
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,780
Wait, maybe let's check.

209
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:20,960
It'll fucking recognize the Batman launcher, but it doesn't recognize Batman the game.

210
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,060
That's so stupid.

211
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,000
All right.

212
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,720
Don't tell me it has a weird ass name.

213
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,220
Oh my god, I swear.

Oh, okay.

219
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,420
Later.

220
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,000
We'll update our controller later.

221
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,020
Alright, do I have to play on PC?

222
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,200
Like, uh, controllers.

00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,180

00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,440

We'll do normal.

I'm gonna make sure I tell... Because I don't...

252
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,290
Batman can't... Doesn't have a fucking gun.

253
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:43,590
So, like, we'll do normal.

254
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:44,510
Like...

255
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:49,170
If he had a gun, I'll play hard.

256
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:54,770
The least stressful night for Batman.

257
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:56,050
Batman.

258
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:57,370
What did you find?

259
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:58,090
Jesus Christ.

260
00:32:58,170 --> 00:32:59,070

Oh, what the fuck kind of phone is this?

270
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:37,320
That's a giant ass SIM card.

271
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:38,460
Huh?

272
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,980
Get your filthy paws off that now.

273
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,200
Ah!

274
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,280
Wake up, Mr. Wake.

275
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,060
We have much to discuss.

276
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,420
You won't get away with this.

277
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,840
I already have.

278
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:08,380
This is Vicky Vale reporting live from Arkham City, the controversial super prison built right here in the heart of Gotham.

279
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:14,500
In a few moments, Bruce Wayne will be live on stage to explain his sudden interest in Gotham politics.

280
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,680
The infamous Playboy millionaire has never been one to...

281
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,420
Oh, that aged really poorly.

282
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,460
That aged really poorly.

283
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:29,580
What do you mean a billionaire shouldn't be interested in politics, guys?

284
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I assume that you thought yourself untouchable.

285
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,120
No one is untouchable.

286
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:43,040
Thank you!

287
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,140
Thank you, Gotham.

288
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,880
In prison behind these walls.

289
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:51,680
Gang leaders are fighting a bloody war in the middle of our once great city.

290
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,320
Wait, did he build Arkham City?

291
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,060
There's no...

292
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,680
Yeah, I was gonna say, that's fucking stupid.

293
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:05,800
I guess you're like, you can't be crime if they all live in Arkham City.

294
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,220
It's out of control.

295
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:09,560
Oh, thank God.

296
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,340
Oh, he's trying to shut it down.

297
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:11,760
Okay.

298
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:15,720
Who the fuck made that decision to build Arkham City?

299
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:19,740
That's such a crazy idea.

300
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:25,440
Like, as if that would fucking solve the crime, right?

301
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,540
It's like creating Crime City.

302
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:32,520
He's like, don't wonder he wants to shut it down.

303
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,760
They were recreating Crime Alley.

304
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,560
Alright.

305
00:36:41,580 --> 00:37:10,720
Arkham did so much easier than bad man you uh call 10 it's ready to begin it will be my legacy a monument to your failure and if you try to stop me I guarantee everyone will know your secret damn why don't you just expose me right now don't have to like tease him

306
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:18,070
James, thank you for the super chat.

307
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:18,470
Thank you.

308
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:19,350
Thank you.

309
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:25,870
Fun fact, at the point in time, Mark Hamill only played a Joker if Kevin Conroy was playing Batman.

310
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:30,990
After he died, he swore off of playing Joker, saying without...

311
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:32,410
Batman crime has no punchline.

312
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:33,150
Yeah, I knew about.

313
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:34,630
Yeah, oh yeah, I knew about that.

314
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:42,110
It's really sweet, you know, that, like, he'll only do Joker if it's with Kevin.

315
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:44,370
Because, like, they both started out together.

316
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:44,890
there.

317
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:49,770
Oh shit.

318
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:52,410
Damn.

319
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:02,490
Am I supposed to?

320
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:03,810
There's no way this is scripted.

321
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:04,310
Yeah.

322
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:09,730
Oh shit.

323
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:12,090
Oh shit.

324
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:14,170
On the ground.

325
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:16,450
Can I just walk away?

326
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:20,410
Oh yeah, I do.

327
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:22,670
I have to line up.

328
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,370
Oh, this is Arkham.

329
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,710
Oh, I'm in Arkham City.

330
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:27,510
Where do I line up?

331
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:28,410
Yeah?

332
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:31,770
Oh, this is Line.

333
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:36,090
Oh, this is literally like Arkham Asylum.

334
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:39,350
Move away!

335
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:41,570
I'm the rich!

336
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:46,390
Oh, shit.

337
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:50,190
This guy is so fucking cocky.

338
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:55,510
Okay, bring overall and bring sound effects and music down.

339
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:55,830
Okay.

340
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:59,330
Let's listen to this part first.

341
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:00,930
Ooh.

342
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:03,330
Pinky.

343
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:08,610
All right, let's adjust the audio real quick.

344
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:09,690
All right, what was it?

345
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:13,310
Sound effects and music.

346
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:15,410
Ooh, that scientist is a freak.

347
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:18,210
It's like the handcuff stays on.

348
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:19,130
Wow, we.

349
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:22,870
Bro, take Bruce out for dinner first.

350
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:26,150
Wait, I was supposed to look up?

351
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:27,210
What was up above me?

352
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:32,110
Whoops, too late.

353
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:36,990
Don't forget to look up.

354
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:39,230
Too late.

355
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:41,270
They closed the door, guys.

356
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:45,010
Oh, not yet, okay.

357
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:48,790
When they open the door, do not panic.

358
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:49,990
Stay close to me.

359
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:56,150
Do you think I'm taking advice from some guy Oh, they don't know.

360
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:57,930
They're trying to scare us.

361
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:00,310
Is it this?

362
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:02,310
Oh, shit.

363
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:04,250
What the fuck?

364
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:06,990
Oh, yeah, no, he's dead.

365
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:09,090
They can spell weakness.

366
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:12,970
To be fair, they do look like nerds.

367
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:15,110
Oh, hey, there's Wayne.

368
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:18,250
There's Wayne Corp right there.

369
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:22,870
Yeah, that's fucking Wayne.

00:40:57,530 --> 00:40:58,490
Oh, shit.

373
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:00,250
Oh, there's Penguin.

374
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,660
Yeah, Batman will save him.

375
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:09,720
I'm Bruce Wayne.

376
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:17,050
What are you talking about?

377
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:18,130
I'm Bruce Wayne.

378
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:20,910
There's no reason for me to save him.

379
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:25,250
Oh, what's up?

380
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:27,470
Do you need me to call you, Butler?

381
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:31,250
Hello, Cobbapot.

382
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:32,270
Hello, Penguin.

383
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:39,010
Oh,

384
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:46,050
shit.

385
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:50,990
Okay, I can counter it.

386
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:53,990
That's looking right.

387
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:55,510
Broke your arm.

388
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:01,390
Okay, they stopped giving me prompts.

389
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:02,690
They're like, you don't need that anymore.

390
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:04,390
You're Bruce Wayne now

391
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:12,410
Oh shit How did yeah, how did he do that?

392
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:23,950
I thought he was just rich I thought the muscles was just ascetic or some shit Doesn't make shit sense Nice

393
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:30,310
He's a man?

394
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:34,550
You mean that six packs real?

395
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:36,210
I thought it was just...

396
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:38,410
Oh my god, you know how you can get plastic surgery where they like...

397
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:39,210
Um...

398
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:41,310
Okay, I gotta bring up the overall volume.

399
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:44,570
You can get plastic surgery where you can have fake abs basically.

400
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:48,750
I don't know exactly what they do, but they insert something in your...

401
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:52,630
on your torso that makes it look like you have abs, but they're not real.

402
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:53,810
Like...

403
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:56,210
It's fucking wild.

404
00:42:56,330 --> 00:42:57,770
I saw like pictures of that shit.

405
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:00,130
Yeah, six-pack implants.

406
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:00,970
Yeah, it's a thing.

407
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:02,490
Yeah, oh, is it saltwater?

408
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:05,190
Yeah, you can literally have six-pack implants and stuff.

409
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:08,870
Need to get to higher ground and contact Alfred.

410
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:16,520
Alright, hold and run.

411
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:19,760
Okay, hold.

412
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:20,980
Sorry, that wasn't running.

413
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:24,900
Oh, and climb.

414
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:26,220
Okay, I gotta climb.

415
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:28,780
Sorry.

416
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,340
That was definitely a misinput, guys.

417
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:33,180
an accident.

418
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,160
Oh, there's a ladder.

419
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:39,520
Fair.

420
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:43,340
Guys, yes, it was definitely an accident.

421
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:45,620
I didn't mean to do that.

422
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:51,540
I'll just try to figure out how to run, Penguin.

423
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:53,740
And not my fault.

424
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:01,340
A billion beats up a cripple.

425
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,360
Um, crippled a billionaire.

426
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,360
So it was technically a fair fight.

427
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,340
It was the rich beating up the rich.

428
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,860
I needed immediate drop on the roof of the Ace Chemicals building.

429
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:13,460
I'm on my way there now.

430
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:14,180
Of course.

431
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:18,920
It's a rich on rich violence.

432
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:19,760
Exactly.

433
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:20,960
Oh shit.

434
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,740
I love the aesthetic of this.

435
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:25,760
Oh my god, it's the Bank of Gotham.

436
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:26,700
I, do you see that?

437
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:27,700
I own that.

438
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,320
You're under close surveillance.

439
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:33,620
Okay.

440
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,120
That, where else are I supposed to go?

441
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:42,820
Where am I supposed to go?

442
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,340
I just dropped down?

443
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,880
I can just about make that jump to the Oh, okay.

444
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,040
I'll be able to climb up from there.

445
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:50,180
This building?

446
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:50,760
Okay.

447
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:57,820
Okay, I was gonna say I don't know if I'll actually make that jump anymore.

448
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:02,220
It's a little hard to figure out like where to go next.

449
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,040
I need my yellow paint.

450
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:11,260
He knows that Bruce Wayne is Batman.

451
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,920
He also told me that something called Protocol 10 will make him famous.

452
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:19,220
I can't leave Arkham City until I find out what it is.

453
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,500
What the fuck is Protocol 10?

454
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,260
I guess we're finding that out soon.

455
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:31,550
Sometimes it makes it look like I am.

456
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:33,170
Oh, there's the Riddler trophies.

457
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:35,890
But sometimes it makes it look like I'm not going to grab the ledge.

458
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:36,770
It's a little scary.

459
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:42,630
I see it.

460
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:47,250

Thank you, thank you.

465
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:26,700
I wonder if you could just play the entire game as Bruce Wayne.

466
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:36,900
I'm hacking.

467
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:44,130

00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:30,060

Oh, run to glide.

00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:50,400
Oh, this is like open world.

491
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:51,720
That's cool.

492
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:54,300
We're not like confined to like a place now.

493
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:55,920
Wait, what is that?

494
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,120

495
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:59,800
Oh, is this goddamn Riddler shit?

496
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,180
Yeah, it is.

497
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:04,680
What?

498
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:08,760
What?

499
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,260
What is this?

500
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:14,720
Zero, what?

501
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:15,280
Oh!

502
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:16,940
Over here!

503
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:17,440
Okay.

504
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,180
Yeah, it's the Riddler's trophy.

505
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:22,940
I'm gonna get it.

506
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:24,180
I'm gonna get it.

507
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:25,280
Oh, shit.

508
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:25,900
Okay, I was...

509
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,160
like figuring out how to get it.

510
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:29,220
Alright.

511
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:30,640
I'm gonna get it.

512
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:31,960
I'm gonna get it.

513
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:32,960
Alright, nice.

514
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:33,820
First trophy.

515
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:39,200
Yeah, yeah.

516
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:40,340
First try.

517
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:51,410
Please, I spent $1 million doing these riddles.

518
00:49:55,350 --> 00:49:56,930
He's like, Batman, please.

519
00:49:57,270 --> 00:50:01,190
I invested a million dollars into all these riddles.

520
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:03,730
You gotta do it.

521
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:09,910
Really a professional criminal.

522
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:11,030
Gotham City.

523
00:50:11,770 --> 00:50:14,690
Oh shit, he's six foot- he's six foot one.

524
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:17,490
Whimp session compulsive need for attention.

525
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:20,710
Is there room to be the cleverest of Gotham City's criminals?

526
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:25,860
Alright.

527
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:28,320
Don't let him start tossing that coin.

528
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:29,840
I'm really glad kick.

529
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:32,380
Wee!

530
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:38,860
The slowest fucking attack of his life.

531
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,620
How the fuck did he get hit by that?

532
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:45,480
He's literally telegraphing that 20 miles away.

533
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:48,980
Alright, got your foot.

534
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:52,340
Oh, combat's pretty easy, though, which is nice.

535
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,120
Time to get our kicks in.

536
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:57,620
Oh my god.

537
00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:01,300
Okay, combat is easy, but they are all like goddamn sponges.

538
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:03,360
However, I feel like I'm doing nothing.

539
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,520
like I'm hitting, like, a punching bag.

540
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:08,920
Boom!

541
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,560
My nuclear fist!

542
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:13,420
There you go.

543
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:13,720
Okay.

544
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:14,980
Oh, he's still alive.

545
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:15,840
Get out of here.

546
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:19,520
Batman's gonna give you a concussion because Batman don't kill.

547
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:23,680
I would love to play an absolute Batman game, though.

548
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,260
I won't fucking swing that axe.

549
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:28,360
Don't worry, it gets hardy.

550
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:32,580
I did not mean to what... I didn't say I wanted to get hardy.

551
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:37,820
All right, let's go through the normal door.

552
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:39,880
Just hospitalized.

553
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:45,900
All right.

554
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:47,740
I don't think I have gadgets yet.

555
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:51,720
The tutorial, the hints didn't tell me about any gadgets.

556
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:54,500
Hello.

557
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:58,020
Oh, knock, knock.

558
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:00,920
I'm too late.

559
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:03,760
Oh my god, wait, is this a courtroom?

560
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:06,520
Oh my god.

561
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:08,500
Are we going to trial Catwoman?

562
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:11,380
The law of...

563
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:12,580
Oh my god, wait, we are!

564
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,340
Oh wait, I don't think there is a trial.

565
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:17,820
We want you.

566
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:21,480
The only way to get by in this place is to get ourselves some respect.

567
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:22,620
Be here.

568
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:24,520
That's how we get respect.

569
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:26,760
Show them all that we do things.

570
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,180
We should be fair, though.

571
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,240
This is a place of justice.

572
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,520
Yeah, I was going to say, this is a court in session?

573
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:36,600
Killer, and they'll all fear us.

574
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:49,660
you know what i'm impressed by with two-faced how he doesn't get any like infections on the half of his body

575
00:52:52,960 --> 00:53:08,800
oh that's we're stealing from us no one steals from us i'm sorry i've been a bad kitty whoa me yeah Let's see if the coin...

576
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:09,160
Absolutely.

577
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:12,400
Meow.

578
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:14,120
Meow.

579
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:21,020
This court is now in session.

580
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:23,780
Oh shit, he gets... he won.

581
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,320
He gets to be a lawyer again.

582
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:28,820
Alright, Harvey Dent, professional criminal.

583
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:36,360
District Attorney was one of Batman's strongest allies in Gotham City.

584
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:37,380
I knew that.

585
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:40,680
He went through acid and dense veins, hiddlingly scarring him.

586
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:47,940
The wounds fractured his psyche, and he was reborn to face a schizo-criminal mastermind obsessed with duality.

587
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:57,800
His former good luck charm, a two-headed trick silver dollar, was damaged on one side of the attack, and Dent has seized on it as a reflection of his half-scared visage.

588
00:53:59,480 --> 00:53:59,980
All right.

589
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:05,060
You know what I did like from the Harley Quinn show?

590
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:06,540
I liked his D.I.

591
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:15,760
that each villain is like a crime lord in like each parts, like in different parts of Gothen City.

592
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:22,500
I like that premise for Gothen City that they're all like a crime lord in each district and stuff.

593
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:32,760
Instead of just being like anarchy, like and it's, oh does Arkham City do that too?

594
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,160
That's inspired.

595
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:37,340
Oh, is it that's basically, oh is it Oh, that's cool.

596
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:38,960
I actually really like that premise.

597
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:40,620
Um, I like that.

598
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:46,420
So, like, instead of, like, the, uh, the Gotham criminals running anarchy on, like, everywhere.

599
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,900
Like, they have, like, a special district and shit.

600
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:49,740
That's cool.

601
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:50,640
I like that.

602
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,260
I've always liked that premise.

603
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:56,140
That's why I like the Harley Quinn show.

604
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:56,980
The first season?

605
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:00,540
But then, like, then the- Taking out the thug with the gun is the key.

606
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:03,040
But then the other season got really bad.

607
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,120
All right, get it out of here.

608
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:06,600
Batman, no need guns.

609
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:08,810
but I have this

610
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:32,060
I thought it would just be like mission spelled oops

611
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:42,900
Okay, okay, I have a perfectly good reason why I thought it would be funny.

612
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:47,780
Sarah, I thought it'd be funny.

613
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:53,420
I legitimately thought that I would, um, it would be like mission failed.

614
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:54,860
I had to redo it again.

615
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:59,380
I didn't realize I just landed right into them.

616
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:00,980
Give me a sec.

617
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:01,820
Oh, shit.

618
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:03,860
Oh, what the fuck did I do?

619
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:05,680
All right.

620
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:38,520
objection oh shit overruled that's not fair he had a gun I was using my fist heads or tails kitty cat what happens if I didn't just fall down not this one oh time to die I vote for a stay of execution ah ah uh Overrule.

621
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:41,760
This is gonna hurt.

622
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,480
Two guns, bitch.

623
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,420
Whoa, two guns?

624
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:51,860
Oh, it pre-brought two guns into the court?

625
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:54,500
I thought it was cats who have nine lives.

626
00:56:58,340 --> 00:56:59,580
One for each face.

627
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:03,100
That's cheating.

628
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,340
How's it hanging, Harv?

629
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:07,140
Oh.

630
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:09,580
Oh no.

631
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,340
Don't go back to my place later.

632
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:29,340
So what do you need, Mr. Detective?

633
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:30,720
Protocol 10.

634
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:32,520
What do you know, Selena?

635
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:34,320
Never heard of it.

636
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:35,980
That's not what I wanted to hear.

637
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:38,240
What about strange?

638
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:40,060
I don't trust him.

639
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:41,640
He's been missing for years.

640
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:44,620
And then is suddenly put in charge of running Arkham City.

641
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,360
Rumor has it he's been working with Joker.

642
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:50,560
Planning something very special just for you.

643
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:52,940
Maybe that's protocol 10.

644
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:57,220
Twinkle, twinkle little bat.

645
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:01,580
Watch me kill your favorite cat.

646
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:02,240
Joker?

647
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:30,740
the little smiley face that's so cute other than the fact that it that it was a sniper shot that's actually a really nice touch this place is dangerous i like it you expecting a kiss it was joker you're not safe here bro take the bait but she's giving that for free she's

652
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:11,960
All right.

653
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:14,580
Bad memory.

654
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:18,160
I'm like, how do I not remember how the Joker looks like?

655
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:20,720
Okay, I'm going to talk to you.

656
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:24,460
You should have finished me, Batman.

657
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:28,860
We'll get out of this and we'll be back.

658
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:31,340
Do I look scared, Harvey?

659
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:32,660
You should.

660
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:35,740
Fate is all that stands in our way.

661
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:46,050
And if the coin says that your time is up, then you'll me we don't get you joker with it

662
01:00:51,400 --> 01:01:02,960

663
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:13,700
that'll be pretty wild the un yeah that's why it was an accident but never kills.

664
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:16,700
It was just a little oopsie.

665
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:17,740
The basement.

666
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:20,840
Oh my god, Calendar Man!

667
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:25,620
The new June and September of 28 is but one.

668
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:27,540
All the rest are 31.

669
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:30,540
Batman is like such a silly supervillain.

670
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:34,500
Every four years got it right.

671
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:36,940
And 28 is 29.

672
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:40,580
Batman doesn't kill, but gravity does.

673
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:41,260
That's true.

674
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:42,680
I love Calendar Man.

675
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:45,140
Don't be scared, Batman.

676
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:50,480
Halloween will be a day to celebrate if you come and see me.

677
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:52,140
Wait, is this game based?

678
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:53,220
Wait, is it Halloween?

679
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:54,900
Halloween, Halloween.

680
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:56,920
All Saints Day.

681
01:01:58,220 --> 01:02:01,660
Wake up the witches or someone will pay.

682
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:05,180
Wait, oh, I didn't even realize.

683
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:08,760
That wasn't even a reason why I picked this game.

684
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:09,760
Wait.

685
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:15,560
Oh, it's based on the date?

686
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:20,160
Oh, wait, no, oh, because it's almost Halloween for me.

687
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:22,240
He's talking about Halloween.

688
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:25,260
The perfect timing.

689
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:26,500
Oh, that's cool.

690
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:28,840
That's so cool.

691
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:32,020
Wait, how do I get the real-earth jokes here?

692
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:34,640
That's cool.

693
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:35,420
I like that.

694
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:40,420
I thought he actually, like, syncs up to your calendar for Calendar Man.

695
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:41,820
Calendar Man.

696
01:02:42,740 --> 01:02:44,420
I forgot, like, his entire lore.

697
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:45,560
I just thought he's so silly.

698
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:48,920
Like, his entire...

699
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:49,900
Like, he just...

700
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:52,320
He just really loves the fucking calendar.

701
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:56,840
Detective mode?

702
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:00,000
Oh, there's something here.

703
01:03:01,420 --> 01:03:02,720
Yeah, he kills based off of...

704
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:04,440
Oh, yeah, he kills based off of holidays.

705
01:03:04,540 --> 01:03:05,460
I remember it now.

706
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:06,920
Alright.

707
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:08,720
Wait, do I just...

708
01:03:10,660 --> 01:03:11,100
Oops.

709
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:12,620
Alright.

710
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:41,880

712
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:51,780
Oh, do I have to do down right?

713
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:55,520
Oh, I thought it was, like, locked or some shit.

714
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:56,340
Okay, wait.

715
01:03:59,060 --> 01:04:00,180
Okay, give me a sec.

716
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:04,500
They didn't give me a tutorial on this, so I'm, like, just as confused.

717
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:07,860
Fucking hell, okay.

718
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:14,700
Wait, I can break it?

719
01:04:14,820 --> 01:04:15,680
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

720
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:21,020
Okay, I'll figure this out.

721
01:04:23,140 --> 01:04:23,980
Okay, slower.

722
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:26,060
Alright, there we go.

723
01:04:27,460 --> 01:04:28,060
Oh, yeah.

724
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:31,400
Don't let me control a drone.

725
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:35,260
Alright, there you go.

726
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:36,540
That should hit it.

727
01:04:38,020 --> 01:04:39,300
Did I do it?

728
01:04:42,630 --> 01:04:43,190
Wait.

729
01:04:44,610 --> 01:04:45,170
That...

730
01:04:45,170 --> 01:04:45,930
Wait a minute.

731
01:04:46,210 --> 01:04:47,390
What did I do?

732
01:04:49,610 --> 01:04:50,170
Okay.

733
01:04:51,610 --> 01:04:52,630
Did it not?

734
01:04:57,590 --> 01:04:59,210
I need the electric bat!

735
01:04:59,310 --> 01:05:00,330
Oh my god.

736
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:03,150
How the fuck was I supposed to know?

737
01:05:03,290 --> 01:05:05,170
I need an electric bat around.

738
01:05:05,710 --> 01:05:07,890
It needs to pass electric...

739
01:05:07,890 --> 01:05:08,190
Wait.

740
01:05:10,550 --> 01:05:11,790
Is there electricity here?

741
01:05:12,650 --> 01:05:15,170
There has to be electricity around here.

742
01:05:17,250 --> 01:05:18,270
I heard...

743
01:05:18,270 --> 01:05:18,790
There it is.

744
01:05:19,510 --> 01:05:21,430
Are you fucking kidding me?

745
01:05:21,930 --> 01:05:22,770
Oh my...

746
01:05:22,770 --> 01:05:23,550
Okay, this better...

01:05:23,570 --> 01:05:53,480

01:05:57,020 --> 01:05:58,780
Okay, we can do this.

749
01:05:58,980 --> 01:05:59,920
We're almost there.

750
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:01,260
No!

751
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:08,240
Okay, this is a fucking stupid puzzle.

752
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:13,120
I hope the Riddler's investment was worth...

753
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:14,980
No, it was definitely worth it for him.

754
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:19,140
The Riddler is having the time of his life right now, watching from his fucking phone.

755
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:23,460
There we go.

756
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:44,580
we did it all right i don't i bet the riddler has like fucking cameras all over here watching from his little phone all right nice i got your stupid ass trophy oh

01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:53,020

758
01:06:58,520 --> 01:06:59,300
I got caught.

759
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:00,220
Oh, that's why.

760
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:03,060
Guys, I got caught some art of calendar math.

761
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:05,360
It was so worth it.

762
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:07,880
Yeah, he's iPad kidding right now.

763
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:09,620
I don't think they hurt us.

764
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:10,300
Good.

765
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:13,280
I can't believe we're still out here at night.

766
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:13,800
Uh-huh.

767
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:14,840
I told you I was sorry.

768
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:16,140
I lost track.

769
01:07:16,620 --> 01:07:17,940
Let's hope it doesn't get us killed.

770
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:19,600
You just need to be careful.

771
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:20,400
Oh, there they are.

772
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:21,740
I move when they fight.

773
01:07:22,460 --> 01:07:25,380
They'll be too busy killing each other to notice us heading back to the camp.

774
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:29,480
I don't understand why they for this place.

775
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:31,860
Two-face ends up owning that bit of street.

776
01:07:32,140 --> 01:07:32,620
So what?

777
01:07:32,980 --> 01:07:34,280
He's still stuck in here.

778
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:36,700
Do you think they see me?

779
01:07:36,980 --> 01:07:38,100
Wait, which one was the map?

780
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:39,780
Oh, shit.

781
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:42,000
Uh, okay, it's less.

782
01:07:42,540 --> 01:07:43,560
Uh, I have to go this way.

783
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:44,240
Oh, my God.

784
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:46,460
This is a big-ass map now that I look at it.

785
01:07:47,340 --> 01:07:47,700
Okay.

786
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:49,080
Hello, guys.

787
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:50,580
Hello, fellow politicians.

788
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:55,440
You're the last person I expected to see in here.

789
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:56,560
What did you do?

790
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:57,980
I'm Batman.

791
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:00,140
Who are you?

792
01:08:00,820 --> 01:08:01,680
Who was I, you mean?

793
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:03,600
In here, you're nothing.

794
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:04,600
Out there?

795
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:06,000
I worked at the company.

796
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:07,300
Have you ever thought about leaving?

797
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:09,040
Yeah, me too.

798
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:10,560
Don't tell me.

799
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,320
You were sent here by Strange.

800
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:16,060
Wait, Crime Alley is an art... Crime City?

801
01:08:16,180 --> 01:08:18,000
You obviously know something you shouldn't.

802
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:20,860
Try to figure out what that is and stay out of sight.

803
01:08:22,580 --> 01:08:22,780
Oh.

804
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:24,140
That was an accident.

805
01:08:27,060 --> 01:08:28,140
You're still in there?

806
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:29,740
I think so.

807
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:31,200
I can hear someone in there.

808
01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:32,780
Keep that door shut, man.

809
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:34,560
I don't want to go head-to-head with Batman.

810
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:36,420
You didn't say it was Batman.

811
01:08:36,940 --> 01:08:38,000
Why the hell are we still here?

812
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:39,180
We should run or something.

813
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:40,460
Oh, that's cute.

814
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:41,660
Don't be stupid.

815
01:08:42,020 --> 01:08:45,160
If you keep that door closed, he can't get out, and we are safe.

816
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:46,040
Really?

817
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:47,780
What's stopping him going out the back?

818
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:48,860
Yeah, I was going to say.

819
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:50,280
There's a back?

820
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:52,080
There's a basement.

821
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:53,000
It's full of cells.

822
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:54,360
There's some guy there.

823
01:08:54,660 --> 01:08:55,900
There's a back door?

824
01:08:58,520 --> 01:08:58,780
Oh.

825
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:00,680
Hey guys.

826
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:02,240
What are you guys waiting for?

827
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:04,280
That's a little awkward.

828
01:09:05,660 --> 01:09:05,940
Boop.

829
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:11,080
That's pretty awkward, isn't it guys?

830
01:09:11,660 --> 01:09:12,720
There's a back?

831
01:09:13,060 --> 01:09:13,320
Yep.

832
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:15,160
A back for Batman.

833
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:18,580
A little awkward, isn't it?

834
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:21,420
Feel a little bit stupid now.

835
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:23,940
That's right.

836
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:27,820
He punched my nuclear fist.

837
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:34,900
Jesus Christ, look, you know I'm breaking some bones right now.

838
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:36,980
I'm fucking taking these guys.

839
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:39,120
Maybe that's how Arkham funds their city.

840
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:41,520
It's literally just hospital bills.

841
01:09:46,260 --> 01:09:46,800
You combo?

842
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:47,820
There's combos?

843
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,200
Alright, nice.

844
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:53,360
Goodbye, guys.

845
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:56,760
Now I'm just gonna aura walk to my next destination.

846
01:09:57,240 --> 01:09:59,980
I was a maniac, but Penguin is worse.

847
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:04,420
Where is that?

848
01:10:05,740 --> 01:10:07,160
Let's just aura walk over.

849
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:10,160
He's young, exactly.

850
01:10:10,260 --> 01:10:11,120
He'll walk again.

851
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:15,200
Oh, I should be able to go...

852
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:16,060
Okay, no, that's steam.

853
01:10:16,660 --> 01:10:18,460
I mean, I should be able to do this, right?

854
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:20,640
Oh, never mind.

855
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:26,840
Tap left trigger for a quick batter at?

856
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:30,920
Oh, that's what it is.

857
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:32,280
That's what it is.

858
01:10:32,980 --> 01:10:36,320
I bet she's nice and warm in there.

859
01:10:36,660 --> 01:10:37,240
Take it easy, man.

860
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:37,940
I'm just asking.

861
01:10:38,780 --> 01:10:39,380
Who was that lady?

862
01:10:39,940 --> 01:10:41,180
The one who got dragged off.

863
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:43,560
No idea.

864
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:47,380
It took a lady?

865
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:50,780
I hope the Joker hurts her bad.

866
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:52,660
Ozari will.

867
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:55,920
He ain't been his usual happy self for a while now.

868
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:56,580
No!

869
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:58,300
You think the Romans are true?

870
01:10:58,520 --> 01:10:59,500
He wasn't happy?

871
01:11:00,940 --> 01:11:01,120
Whoa!

872
01:11:02,980 --> 01:11:04,280
about the Joker dying.

873
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:08,560
No idea, man, but he didn't look too good last time I saw him.

874
01:11:08,660 --> 01:11:09,720
No, I know this.

875
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:10,380
Oh, guys.

876
01:11:10,540 --> 01:11:13,700
Okay, it's not spoilers because I remember this plot twist.

877
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:19,000
Like, the Joker got the Joker got, like, cancer or something.

878
01:11:19,420 --> 01:11:21,800
I forgot about that.

879
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:27,360
It's like in the third game, um, in the third game, he's, like, dead.

880
01:11:28,060 --> 01:11:32,880
Uh, and and like, and like, he just hallucinates the Joker.

881
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:35,980
He got super cancer.

882
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:38,940
Alright.

883
01:11:43,330 --> 01:11:44,530
What did I do?

884
01:11:44,710 --> 01:11:45,190
Wait, what?

885
01:11:45,970 --> 01:11:47,070
What the fuck is that?

886
01:11:49,210 --> 01:11:51,110
Oh, it's the explosive gel.

887
01:11:51,270 --> 01:11:52,410
Wait, how do I get that to work?

888
01:11:56,910 --> 01:11:58,310
Random bullshit, go!

889
01:11:59,370 --> 01:12:00,450
I'm at the church.

890
01:12:01,070 --> 01:12:02,810
It looks like Harley Quinn is inside.

891
01:12:02,990 --> 01:12:03,670
Oh, is that Harley Quinn?

892
01:12:04,310 --> 01:12:06,470
There's no doubt setting a trap for you.

893
01:12:07,350 --> 01:12:09,370
Alfred Quinn never was too smart.

894
01:12:09,850 --> 01:12:14,770
I'll be okay All right, geez, what do you mean Harley Quinn?

895
01:12:15,070 --> 01:12:17,890
She hasn't she has a master's degree.

896
01:12:18,190 --> 01:12:26,610
What the she she has a doctorate Harley Quinn was never that's when damn Batman Damn, sorry.

897
01:12:26,870 --> 01:13:04,690
I'm sorry if I spoiled it for you guys I just remember that scene because it was so famous on my Yeah, she literally has a fucking PhD of Batman man jesus uh titan's overdose in arkham asylum how is mine's further deteriorated she's finally determined to put a smile back on this yeah because he overdosed on titan so now he got like i guess super cancer now um that's why they couldn't like make more arc like batman games like they couldn't really make more sequels to the backman arkham series because you know they

898
01:13:07,890 --> 01:13:10,110
So it's not the same.

899
01:13:13,010 --> 01:13:14,370
That's what I remember.

900
01:13:14,710 --> 01:13:16,070
They're like, well, he's dead.

901
01:13:16,190 --> 01:13:17,570
What do we do now?

902
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:26,540
You can't flip forever.

903
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:28,800
You can't flip forever, Harley.

904
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:30,380
That's right.

905
01:13:33,660 --> 01:13:34,940
Okay, there we go.

906
01:13:35,140 --> 01:13:36,040
We did it.

907
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:41,280
Wait, I just hit her once.

908
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:44,880
smack

909
01:13:48,100 --> 01:14:15,500
I didn't think she did just takes one stab yeah so anyway here's the deal Mr. J is really not up to a visit right now he's not feeling himself well actually he was earlier but that's not what I meant he's not doing so good in that idiot doctor I sent from here I've seen more smarts from these bozos.

910
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,700
I've got to run, boys.

911
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:21,700
If he tries anything funny, kill him.

912
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:23,380
Oh, geez.

913
01:14:23,780 --> 01:14:24,760
Bro, what?

914
01:14:25,660 --> 01:14:27,560
You lost the fight.

915
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:28,140
What?

916
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:32,620
Attacking armed thugs head-on is suicide.

917
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:34,020
I need to disappear.

918
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:36,200
Pick them off silently one by one.

919
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:38,060
Well, they sort of know I'm here now.

920
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:39,400
Oh, shit.

921
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:42,140
What do you mean?

922
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:43,120
Pakistan!

923
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:48,320
Where could I go?

924
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:50,980
Gamers don't look up.

925
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:52,500
Time to survey the room.

926
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:54,000
Plan out my tactics.

927
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:54,620
Alright.

928
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:57,540
Four thugs, all armed, two hostages.

929
01:14:58,120 --> 01:14:58,980
This is gonna be easy.

930
01:14:59,020 --> 01:14:59,680
Oh shit.

931
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:01,740
Is this though?

932
01:15:02,940 --> 01:15:03,900
Black man.

933
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:05,080
Can you hear me?

934
01:15:05,740 --> 01:15:06,980
Try and get us beneath.

935
01:15:07,180 --> 01:15:08,520
That won't stop him.

936
01:15:08,780 --> 01:15:10,260
Oh man, I'm gonna die in here.

937
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:12,160
Alright.

938
01:15:12,860 --> 01:15:13,700
R-T-Y.

939
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:14,620
Okay.

940
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:17,100
Wait, am I not?

941
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:19,340
Oh, I am.

942
01:15:19,940 --> 01:15:20,360
Okay.

943
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:23,560
Oh, wait, I'm not...

944
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:23,760
Am I?

945
01:15:26,220 --> 01:15:27,660
Okay, wait, we gotta go here.

946
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:29,760
I'm thinking, guys.

947
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:31,200
He thinks he's safe in the confessional.

948
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:33,940
He's just made it easier for me to get in behind him.

949
01:15:34,020 --> 01:15:34,680
Wait, he did?

950
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:37,240
He...

951
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:38,040
He did?

952
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:41,040
I was like, really?

953
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:45,840
Batman, you gotta tell me what to do, Batman.

954
01:15:46,260 --> 01:15:48,080
I don't know what I'm doing.

955
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:50,620
Okay.

956
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:55,340
If I can get behind those two without being seen, I can take them both in one move.

957
01:15:57,780 --> 01:15:58,320
I can?

958
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:02,380
Bro, he's like saying things.

959
01:16:06,310 --> 01:16:06,750
Um.

960
01:16:11,330 --> 01:16:11,850
Oh,

961
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:21,140
double takedown.

962
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:22,220
Okay, there you go.

963
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:24,000
There we go.

964
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:24,460
Nice.

965
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:26,680
And then we go back up.

966
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:29,080
You're safe now.

967
01:16:29,380 --> 01:16:30,160
Batman's here.

968
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,620
Where is he in the confession of?

969
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:38,680
Oh, I have to go this way.

970
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:39,020
Okay.

971
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,440
Oh, when by wooden panel?

972
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:47,600
Holy shit!

973
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:50,180
Oh my god, that's crazy.

974
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:52,680
That's crazy.

975
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:54,880
Wait here and don't make a noise.

976
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:56,540
Let's see, look.

977
01:16:56,700 --> 01:16:57,820
Human organs.

978
01:16:57,940 --> 01:16:58,660
Wait, I need that.

979
01:17:00,460 --> 01:17:01,680
Oh, there's one more.

980
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:02,980
Okay, I'll do that too.

981
01:17:03,860 --> 01:17:04,580
I got you.

982
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,200
He's got a hostage.

983
01:17:06,660 --> 01:17:07,460
He's got a hostage.

984
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:10,840
I can glide to the scaffolding above him without being seen.

985
01:17:11,140 --> 01:17:12,160
And take him down from there.

986
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:14,880
Holy shit, these are all like the self shit.

987
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:17,940
Weeeeee.

988
01:17:18,340 --> 01:17:21,140
Silent takedown went directly above them.

989
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:21,960
Am I not above?

990
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:22,960
Oh, here we go.

991
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:26,320
Oh, that's cool.

992
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:28,800
I'm gonna forget all of this.

993
01:17:29,260 --> 01:17:30,580
Oh my god, my thighs.

994
01:17:30,780 --> 01:17:32,220
My thighs are still got him.

995
01:17:32,380 --> 01:17:33,160
The room is secure.

996
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:35,360
You're safe now, everyone.

997
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:37,480
My back thighs secured it.

998
01:17:38,580 --> 01:17:39,360
Yo, Batman.

999
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:40,460

Gadgets in combat?

1003
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,060
I don't think I...

1004
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:23,740
Can I even do gadgets in combat?

1005
01:18:24,780 --> 01:18:26,260
I don't think I can.

1006
01:18:26,860 --> 01:18:27,240

01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:30,140
Okay.

1010
01:18:30,820 --> 01:18:31,720
What do I...

1011
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:32,420
What's the best...

1012
01:18:32,420 --> 01:18:34,220
Oh my god, there's so many upgrades.

1013
01:18:34,540 --> 01:18:35,040
Holy shit.

1014
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:37,200
Wait, what do I get?

1015
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:38,580
Predator.

1016
01:18:38,940 --> 01:18:39,440
Whoa!

1017
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:41,000
Oh, okay, it's just a takedown.

1018
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:41,880
That was like...

1019
01:18:42,180 --> 01:19:08,000

well later we're definitely not in control earlier oh hey there's the organ donor what happened Yeah.

1023
01:19:55,620 --> 01:19:56,300
He's not a prisoner.

1024
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:57,360
He's a doctor.

1025
01:19:58,100 --> 01:19:58,820
Was he attacked?

1026
01:19:59,400 --> 01:19:59,640
No.

1027
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:01,720
It's terrible, really.

1028
01:20:02,420 --> 01:20:04,960
He transferred here, but I think it was too much for him.

1029
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:07,520
We didn't realize he was losing it.

1030
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:09,720
And he, we should have noticed.

1031
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:11,440
Noticed what?

1032
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:12,220
Notice what?

1033
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:13,840
Oh.

1034
01:20:14,220 --> 01:20:14,620
What?

1035
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:16,040
What?

1036
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:17,340
I used them when he...

1037
01:20:17,340 --> 01:20:18,420
When he cut his own face.

1038
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:18,880
What?

1039
01:20:19,220 --> 01:20:20,240
I found him.

1040
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:23,060
He was sitting in the corner, laughing.

1041
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:24,320
His face.

1042
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:26,560
He got jokered!

1043
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:27,520
I knocked him up and sedated him.

1044
01:20:28,180 --> 01:20:29,700
Who knows what's in that case he's holding on to.

1045
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:31,020
We couldn't try it loose.

1046
01:20:31,980 --> 01:20:33,840
I mean, it says human organs.

1047
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:36,220
Oh my god.

1048
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:38,380
Locate the location.

1049
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:41,720
How crazy do you have to be to cut your own face off?

1050
01:20:41,740 --> 01:20:42,660
Yeah, I was gonna say, Jesus.

1051
01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:45,760
I wonder, like...

1052
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:47,720
Did he got jokered or some shit?

1053
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:56,720
Talk to the doctor.

1054
01:20:56,860 --> 01:20:57,580
Wait, there's doctors?

1055
01:20:58,020 --> 01:20:58,280
Hello.

1056
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:23,630
that woman come in here and do all this why kill us quinn's only priority is to protect joker she's dangerous so i see well thanks batman it's funny i figured people would be grateful to have us here i guess i was wrong yeah that was your first why the fuck would you go to crime city that's where crime is these animals will pay

1057
01:21:31,780 --> 01:21:37,600
I mean, yeah, I felt like the prison system was a lot, should be a bit, like, was a lot better.

1058
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:40,040
Thank God you got here, Batman.

1059
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:44,220
After what happened at the asylum, I thought you'd settle for a quiet desk job.

1060
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:45,600
Yeah, right.

1061
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:52,180
When Shark closed down the asylum, it turned out there wasn't much work for an ex-security guard who failed to stop a mass breakout.

1062
01:21:52,420 --> 01:21:53,180
That's true.

1063
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:55,800
That doesn't look good on the resume.

1064
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:37,300
here that crazy bitch busted in a couple of hours ago with the rest of these idiots took something up the tower then blew up the staircase thanks I'll check it out all right why would they do that sorry Batman I forgot a couple of them grabbed one of the docks Quinn said something about needing her to fix up the Joker if she's alive I'll find her you concentrate on securing this church oh so they have hostages again hope you find the doc her name's Stacy Baker she's one of the good ones you mean they're a battle oh yeah yeah there's yeah i forgot there are a lot of bad ones the asylum i volunteered to work in cash's crew figured we could make a difference

1065
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:50,580
okay uh interrogate locate the source of the sniper shot i assume it's up top wasn't it

1066
01:22:54,620 --> 01:23:00,140
why is this highlighted I'll use my detector.

1067
01:23:01,540 --> 01:23:01,540
Oh, there.

1068
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:03,200
I need to find a way up there.

1069
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:04,160
Yeah, I was going to say it.

1070
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:06,100
I just need to figure out how to get up there.

1071
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,500
Can we broken with enough force?

1072
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:10,240
Wait.

1073
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:11,200
Oops.

1074
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:13,800
I guess I'll open this door.

1075
01:23:20,010 --> 01:23:21,450
Alright, I'm up here now.

1076
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:27,080
Is the bell tower?

1077
01:23:27,260 --> 01:23:28,060
I assume it is.

1078
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:29,300
There's bells here.

1079
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:34,080
I mean, it makes sense.

1080
01:23:34,660 --> 01:23:35,060
Okay.

1081
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:41,080
Oh, grappling.

1082
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:47,400
It's like there's like a lot of places you can explore with all the tools you have.

1083
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:50,660
There's the gun.

1084
01:23:51,620 --> 01:23:51,700
Oh.

1085
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:54,140
It looks like it's being controlled remotely by Joker.

1086
01:23:56,380 --> 01:23:58,420
Yeah, we got to scan this evidence area.

1087
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:01,540
Let's scan this gun.

1088
01:24:04,180 --> 01:24:05,900
Oh, there he is.

1089
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:09,180
Hello, Joker.

1090
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:11,200
I haven't seen you for...

1091
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:12,280
How long has it been?

1092
01:24:12,780 --> 01:24:13,620
Let's see.

1093
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:17,420
There was an asylum, some monsters, and all that's right.

1094
01:24:17,820 --> 01:24:19,540
You left me to die.

1095
01:24:20,260 --> 01:24:21,160
Now you probably don't...

1096
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:22,600
You try to kill me!

1097
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:25,600
You just need to worry about the bombs.

1098
01:24:25,620 --> 01:24:26,440
The bombs?

1099
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:27,780
Hurry up now.

1100
01:24:28,220 --> 01:24:29,080
Clock's ticking.

1101
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:31,540
No way I'm timed, right?

1102
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:36,600
Oh, shit, I'm timed!

1103
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:37,960
Oh, shit!

1104
01:24:44,220 --> 01:24:46,320
Let it fit.

1105
01:24:51,060 --> 01:24:52,940
Okay, all right, we made it.

1106
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:55,840
Was there ever any doubt?

1107
01:24:56,580 --> 01:24:59,060
The radio signal should lead me right to it.

1108
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:00,020
Good luck, sir.

1109
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:06,980
Track down the source of the signal to locate Joker.

1110
01:25:09,940 --> 01:25:14,540
Well, yeah, okay, guys, I will say, like...

1111
01:25:19,780 --> 01:25:23,460
Look, all I'm saying, like...

1112
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:30,520
Look, all I'm saying, like, why would my first instinct be, you know, to go to the...

1113
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:33,620
Go to where the bomb, like, say where the bomb was.

1114
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:36,040
We're safer here than out there.

1115
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:37,980
I'll get us some food.

1116
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:44,120
Yeah, I would have not known that.

1117
01:25:45,260 --> 01:25:47,320
It's literally like...

1118
01:25:51,350 --> 01:25:52,150
No, I shouldn't.

1119
01:25:52,210 --> 01:25:55,490
I know they're just standing there menacingly.

1120
01:25:58,630 --> 01:25:59,650
It's this way.

1121
01:26:00,870 --> 01:26:01,390
Wee!

1122
01:26:01,850 --> 01:26:02,370
That's this.

1123
01:26:02,370 --> 01:26:02,610
No way.

1124
01:26:03,170 --> 01:26:05,010
Must have been something to do with Holly.

1125
01:26:05,330 --> 01:26:07,470
I told you she was up to something earlier.

1126
01:26:08,290 --> 01:26:10,350
Why would Joker want the roof of a church blow?

1127
01:26:10,350 --> 01:26:11,010
That's this.

1128
01:26:11,170 --> 01:26:13,050
Oh my god, it's a stupid riddle shit.

1129
01:26:13,690 --> 01:26:16,850
His million dollar investment on just to fucking piss me off.

1130
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:25,040
Wait, crime alley?

1131
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:27,100
Is this crime alley right here?

1132
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:28,780
Yeah, keep up, man.

1133
01:26:29,780 --> 01:26:31,140
What the fuck is crime alley?

1134
01:26:35,580 --> 01:26:36,940
That's a wall, yeah.

1135
01:26:42,740 --> 01:26:43,580
Oh, not yet?

1136
01:26:43,780 --> 01:26:43,980
Oh, not yet?

1137
01:26:43,980 --> 01:26:45,740
Okay, I was gonna say, where can I give him trauma?

1138
01:26:53,650 --> 01:26:56,390
Wait, why are there balloons?

1139
01:26:56,570 --> 01:26:57,150
Wait, there's balloons there.

1140
01:26:57,330 --> 01:26:58,050
Oh, shit!

1141
01:27:01,230 --> 01:27:03,470
Yeah, I can keep going up.

1142
01:27:05,650 --> 01:27:06,550
What's this?

1143
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:11,350
What is that open?

1144
01:27:15,590 --> 01:27:16,750
Oh, here.

1145
01:27:17,690 --> 01:27:19,290
Okay, I'm not bothering with that.

1146
01:27:22,510 --> 01:27:23,770
Wait, not here?

1147
01:27:24,490 --> 01:27:25,410
Come on, man.

1148
01:27:25,590 --> 01:27:26,870
I'm starving here.

1149
01:27:27,090 --> 01:27:28,310
Just give me a couple of minutes.

1150
01:27:29,310 --> 01:27:30,830
You ever stop to take what's in those cans?

1151
01:27:31,730 --> 01:27:36,110
I'm just listening to these criminals having their most casual conversations.

1152
01:27:36,830 --> 01:27:37,750
Welcome, inmates.

1153
01:27:38,330 --> 01:27:40,830

Oh my god, Funland!

1157
01:27:49,070 --> 01:27:50,390
It has to be here.

Wrong.

1166
01:28:33,710 --> 01:28:35,270
Wrong company.

1167
01:28:42,140 --> 01:28:42,360
There you go.

1168
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:45,800

There you go.

1170
01:28:50,220 --> 01:28:50,740
Random bullshit.

01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:51,520
Yay!

1172
01:28:55,440 --> 01:29:00,960
Nice, we did it.

1173
01:29:03,540 --> 01:29:07,100
I want to activate my trap here, anyway.

1174
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:14,080
Alright.

1175
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:16,300
Oops.

1176
01:29:17,540 --> 01:29:18,860
Okay, there's people over here.

1177
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:20,660
Alright, is this...

1178
01:29:20,660 --> 01:29:21,900
No, it's not this way.

1179
01:29:22,020 --> 01:29:22,740
Is it this way?

1180
01:29:24,780 --> 01:29:25,860
Okay, it's this way.

1181
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:28,860
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

1182
01:29:29,740 --> 01:29:30,620
It's me, Batman!

1183
01:29:32,820 --> 01:29:35,320
By the time, they can't even get to me.

1184
01:29:35,860 --> 01:29:37,100
That's how fucked up it is.

1185
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:38,560
I could just keep throwing this.

1186
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:41,840
I have unlimited Batarans.

1187
01:29:42,980 --> 01:29:46,220
70% of the Batman budget goes to Batarans.

1188
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:46,960
Let's go.

1189
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:50,000
I got my deep ass.

1190
01:29:50,220 --> 01:29:51,160
Wait, how did he get here?

1191
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:52,000
He was not supposed to...

1192
01:29:52,020 --> 01:30:14,940
to be my fatter hands are supposed to avoid that there you go okay fine I'll watch your stupid ass AR training all right there you are you happy now game money well spent let's go

1193
01:30:18,420 --> 01:30:26,000
huh I know what you guys are thinking is it all true is life with.

1194
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:30,280
I'm listening.

1195
01:30:30,280 --> 01:30:30,640
I'm listening.

1196
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:30,880
Mr. J is...

1197
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:32,580
but look on the bright side.

1198
01:30:33,020 --> 01:30:34,960
At least you know what you're getting yourself into.

1199
01:30:35,540 --> 01:30:36,100
Listen up, Don Agnes.

1200
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:37,780
And listen carefully.

1201
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:40,800
I'm listening.

1202
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:41,840
You know...

1203
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:43,480
Mr. J is...

1204
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:44,800
He's...

1205
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:45,680
He's...

1206
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:45,780
He's...

1207
01:30:45,780 --> 01:30:46,420
He's not himself.

1208
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:54,640
And the last thing he needs is any so-called superhero coming in here and stopping his recuperation.

1209
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:58,220
That's where you come in, morons.

1210
01:30:58,580 --> 01:31:01,340
You need to protect the steel mill.

1211
01:31:01,960 --> 01:31:03,040
Protect it with your life.

1212
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:03,760
Oh, there it is.

1213
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:09,540
Because if you fail, I'll make sure your lives don't make zips.

1214
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:11,300
Hello?

1215
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:14,100
Oh, security area.

1216
01:31:15,380 --> 01:31:16,460
Alright, that's fine.

1217
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:17,300
I can do that.

1218
01:31:18,060 --> 01:31:18,460
Slap.

1219
01:31:20,780 --> 01:31:21,880
Oh, there we go.

1220
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:24,100
I have to time it correctly.

1221
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:26,920
Okay, let me see.

1222
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:27,820
I can time this.

1223
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:37,140
I'm trying to get the critical strike thing working.

1224
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:39,800
Oh, shit!

1225
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:40,820
I got it!

1226
01:31:41,100 --> 01:31:41,740
Boom!

1227
01:31:42,620 --> 01:31:42,620
Boom!

1228
01:31:47,630 --> 01:31:48,050
Alright.

1229
01:31:49,430 --> 01:31:51,210
It's random bullshit time.

1230
01:31:55,060 --> 01:31:56,120
I'm done.

1231
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:59,140
I can't shoot a gun, but I can shoot battle.

1232
01:31:59,200 --> 01:31:59,700
friends.

1233
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:03,820
There you go.

1234
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:06,100
Get out of here.

1235
01:32:07,180 --> 01:32:11,480
I like how even the Bataran does like a fucking nuke sound effects too.

1236
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:16,360
All right, let's answer the phone.

1237
01:32:17,220 --> 01:32:17,940
Hello, Batman.

1238
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:20,600
Do you recognize my voice?

1239
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:21,400
Zaz?

1240
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:22,400
Victor Zaz.

1241
01:32:23,220 --> 01:32:24,400
In the flesh.

1242
01:32:25,700 --> 01:32:27,380
I'm so happy you remember me.

1243
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:29,180
I'll never forget.

1244
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:50,600
you i've got a special game planned batman a game just for you really is that where all the budget goes they just want to make some fun games for me all right oh it's him shadow of the bat none formally blind

1245
01:32:54,850 --> 01:33:32,770
a true sociopath zaz grew up in the life of ease but nonetheless became a serial killer in the in his prey body count is the only thing that matters um he craves cars a mark for each of the victim um into his own body and saving a special spot for batman wait where would i where would i go where would i have the special spot be i'm a little worried where do you think the special spot is his special spot Arkham City is the home to the most notorious criminals.

1246
01:33:33,090 --> 01:33:37,910
Okay, so I assume like that's the AR training.

1247
01:33:42,830 --> 01:33:43,530
Oh, that's cool.

1248
01:33:43,730 --> 01:33:44,990
They have like radio signals.

1249
01:33:45,810 --> 01:33:46,430
That's cool.

1250
01:33:47,070 --> 01:33:48,550
Wait, but where would Zaz be?

1251
01:33:52,020 --> 01:33:55,300
I guess we'll never know what Zaz's special game is.

1252
01:33:56,300 --> 01:34:08,820
Sorry about the Joker having super cancer he gets five big booms uh season thank you the super chat thank you thank you oh is it random phone calls oh i see

1253
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:15,370

01:34:19,380 --> 01:34:24,600
we're gonna go to a little fun house oh

1255
01:34:31,100 --> 01:34:32,620
Wait, is it not here?

1256
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:41,960
I don't want to get rid of the local surveillance.

1257
01:34:42,140 --> 01:34:43,500
I don't want to hear them.

1258
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:49,700
Like, I don't like the overlap dialogue that it does.

1259
01:34:53,530 --> 01:34:54,050
Oh, is it up?

1260
01:34:55,650 --> 01:34:57,230
Oh, it's always on.

1261
01:34:57,310 --> 01:35:04,370
I feel like the local surveillance should, like, Turned off when, you know, the Joker is talking.

1262
01:35:06,330 --> 01:35:07,490
I don't know.

1263
01:35:07,630 --> 01:35:09,450
Maybe that makes too much sense.

1264
01:35:14,170 --> 01:35:17,110
Alfred, I need to find a route into the Cyanus steel mill.

1265
01:35:17,450 --> 01:35:19,010
Have you tried the front door, sir?

1266
01:35:19,470 --> 01:35:20,710
Why didn't I think of that?

1267
01:35:21,010 --> 01:35:21,310
It was

1268
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:28,120
obviously...

1269
01:35:28,120 --> 01:35:29,220
I see where I am.

1270
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:31,360
The main chimney.

1271
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:32,820
Okay, then.

1272
01:35:33,580 --> 01:35:34,180
The chimney?

1273
01:35:36,160 --> 01:35:37,800
Oh, it's like literally next to me.

1274
01:35:39,180 --> 01:35:40,960
Yeah, it's that.

1275
01:35:44,830 --> 01:35:48,850
Oh my god, look, that's... Okay, yeah, no wonder... Okay, Batman.

1276
01:35:52,710 --> 01:35:55,870
That's looking crazy, but what if...

1277
01:35:57,570 --> 01:36:03,450
No, Doki, don't give in to your intrusive... Okay, but what happens?

1278
01:36:09,250 --> 01:36:11,330
Stupid little dead bat!

1279
01:36:11,790 --> 01:36:13,710
Who's gonna save you now?

1280
01:36:14,430 --> 01:36:14,990
Okay.

1281
01:36:15,730 --> 01:36:17,370
No, I didn't deserve that.

1282
01:36:17,630 --> 01:36:19,470
Stupid little bitch.

1283
01:36:22,790 --> 01:36:23,350
Alright.

1284
01:36:24,010 --> 01:36:25,250
I was just curious.

1285
01:36:25,590 --> 01:36:26,290
I was like, do I get...

1286
01:36:26,290 --> 01:36:28,270
Like, he doesn't even say anything.

1287
01:36:28,790 --> 01:36:30,250
He just accepts it.

1288
01:36:30,290 --> 01:36:31,270
Like, that's crazy.

1289
01:36:32,390 --> 01:36:36,810
I think it's crazy that he just accepts his spate.

1290
01:36:37,290 --> 01:36:38,990
He's like, he doesn't say any...

1291
01:36:38,990 --> 01:36:40,690
No, not even a scream.

1292
01:36:41,210 --> 01:36:44,230
He just fucking disappears into...

1293
01:36:44,250 --> 01:36:44,930
With the lava.

1294
01:36:47,050 --> 01:36:47,870
He's cool.

1295
01:36:48,350 --> 01:36:48,690
That's why.

1296
01:36:51,230 --> 01:36:51,430
Hmm.

1297
01:36:52,670 --> 01:36:56,150
I thought it was just crazy that he doesn't even bother to say anything.

1298
01:37:06,660 --> 01:37:07,040
Okay.

1299
01:37:08,020 --> 01:37:08,480
Nice.

1300
01:37:09,020 --> 01:37:09,760
That's cool.

1301
01:37:09,900 --> 01:37:11,040
Of all the different gadgets.

1302
01:37:14,580 --> 01:37:16,180
I assume I had to drop down.

1303
01:37:16,300 --> 01:37:17,280
Because I cooled it.

1304
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:21,500
Getting from the end.

1305
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:23,060
Oops.

1306
01:37:25,140 --> 01:37:25,280
Oop.

1307
01:37:26,360 --> 01:37:27,460
Owey.

1308
01:37:28,920 --> 01:37:29,320
Okay.

1309
01:37:30,300 --> 01:37:31,520
Go here.

1310
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:37,560
Ah.

1311
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:41,140
Zoom is here.

1312
01:37:44,420 --> 01:37:44,680
Alright.

1313
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:46,120
Detective mode.

1314
01:37:48,940 --> 01:37:50,000
Oh, right here.

1315
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:50,420
Okay.

1316
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:53,500
Oh my god, it's my explosive gel.

1317
01:37:54,940 --> 01:37:57,480
Where I get to draw my little pictures too.

1318
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:01,160
There you go.

1319
01:38:02,500 --> 01:38:03,860
Put it back on the batter end.

1320
01:38:07,720 --> 01:38:09,380
There's so many controls to remember.

1321
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:10,200
Ow.

1322
01:38:13,460 --> 01:38:16,160
Oh, there's a button here.

1323
01:38:18,740 --> 01:38:19,300
There you go.

1324
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:22,800
Yeah, Joker wants you to think you're sick.

1325
01:38:23,080 --> 01:38:26,920
I don't know, man.

1326
01:38:27,340 --> 01:38:29,940
I promised you some entertainment, right, boy?

1327
01:38:30,540 --> 01:38:30,960
Yeah?

1328
01:38:31,400 --> 01:38:32,820
Wait, that's a doctor!

1329
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:36,060
No!

1330
01:38:40,660 --> 01:38:42,280
Bro, okay, she could have...

1331
01:38:42,280 --> 01:38:44,900
Okay, honestly, she would have been dead by now here.

1332
01:38:45,040 --> 01:38:49,380
Am I supposed to just watch?

1333
01:38:50,440 --> 01:38:51,480
Mr. Hammer?

1334
01:38:52,780 --> 01:38:53,900
Holy shit!

1335
01:38:57,020 --> 01:38:59,120
Oh my god, wait, how do I save it?

1336
01:39:00,260 --> 01:39:00,660
Oh,

1337
01:39:05,120 --> 01:39:06,040
that's awkward.

1338
01:39:06,780 --> 01:39:07,380
Oh, give me a sec.

1339
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:09,280
I'm going to try and figure this out.

1340
01:39:09,540 --> 01:39:11,980
Don't worry, I'll save you very soon.

1341
01:39:18,700 --> 01:39:20,680
It's very nice of them to wait for me.

1342
01:39:23,580 --> 01:39:24,620
Oh, is it time?

1343
01:39:25,420 --> 01:39:26,520
Oh, it is.

1344
01:39:26,860 --> 01:39:26,860
Okay.

1345
01:39:27,060 --> 01:39:29,160

1356
01:41:54,720 --> 01:41:58,240

1357
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:02,200

1360
01:43:14,700 --> 01:43:50,300

1361
01:43:55,610 --> 01:43:57,610

1363
01:44:20,720 --> 01:44:22,640
But I think Batman may be here.

1364
01:44:23,080 --> 01:44:24,960
If you see him, kill him.

1365
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:25,820
Alright.

1366
01:44:26,600 --> 01:44:28,380
I thought I'd say what I have, like, a bonus.

1367
01:44:28,440 --> 01:44:31,320
I thought I could, like, destroy it for, like, bonus trophies.

1368
01:44:34,740 --> 01:44:35,780
Are they coming later?

1369
01:44:36,120 --> 01:44:42,940
Okay, because I'm like, what's the point of adopting all these orphans and letting them live in my house if I can't use them?

1370
01:44:47,750 --> 01:44:49,210
Where am I supposed to go?

1371
01:44:49,490 --> 01:44:49,890
I'm here.

1372
01:44:52,970 --> 01:45:02,390
right okay wait what does my detective uh this cover should be smashed open with if hit hard enough

1373
01:45:05,870 --> 01:45:09,130
ac motor twilight i wonder

1374
01:45:13,050 --> 01:45:28,180
no oh there's a door who would have thought there was just a door lying there in trophy location.

1375
01:45:30,020 --> 01:45:31,540
Oh, there's the Riddler shit.

1376
01:45:36,370 --> 01:45:37,070
Alright, goodbye.

1377
01:45:40,370 --> 01:45:42,250
How the fuck do I get this?

1378
01:45:43,250 --> 01:45:45,070
Scan in to add them to...

1379
01:45:45,070 --> 01:45:47,230
Oh, to add them to the map.

1380
01:45:47,410 --> 01:45:48,850
Oh, I see it.

1381
01:45:49,030 --> 01:45:50,310
I just hold it.

1382
01:45:50,590 --> 01:45:50,910
Okay.

1383
01:45:51,490 --> 01:45:52,430
Understand now.

1384
01:45:52,910 --> 01:45:53,790
Can I hold it enough?

1385
01:45:56,410 --> 01:45:56,970
Okay.

1386
01:46:00,350 --> 01:46:01,790
Alright, I already did it.

1387
01:46:02,830 --> 01:46:04,290
I don't have it yet.

1388
01:46:06,770 --> 01:46:12,030
Yeah, it's a point of exploring children for labor if they can't even do the labor.

1389
01:46:12,430 --> 01:46:15,450
If anyone asks about Mr. J, tell him he's fine.

1390
01:46:15,990 --> 01:46:17,390
No, don't tell him anything.

1391
01:46:18,030 --> 01:46:20,290
Well, tell him that you're not gonna talk about it.

1392
01:46:20,530 --> 01:46:22,030
And then shut him in the face.

1393
01:46:22,390 --> 01:46:22,650
Okay.

1394
01:46:23,230 --> 01:46:25,330
Oh, that's some good advice, Harley.

1395
01:46:25,550 --> 01:46:27,390
I think Batman may be here.

1396
01:46:27,810 --> 01:46:29,330
If you see him, kill him.

1397
01:46:30,210 --> 01:46:31,110
I'm not scanning.

1398
01:46:31,330 --> 01:46:32,190
I'm pretty sure I did.

1399
01:46:32,230 --> 01:46:33,510
Oh, I did not scan it.

1400
01:46:33,930 --> 01:46:35,430
Oh, it's not like I'm going to come back anyway.

1401
01:46:35,550 --> 01:46:36,450
Who are we fooling?

1402
01:46:38,350 --> 01:46:40,850
You think I'm really going to backtrack that?

1403
01:46:42,610 --> 01:46:45,490
I need to find a different way to get past Joker's men.

1404
01:46:46,790 --> 01:46:51,190
Are you splitting orange?

1405
01:46:51,330 --> 01:46:51,510
Oh.

1406
01:46:52,910 --> 01:46:56,390
The whole world will have forgotten about her boyfriend soon enough.

1407
01:46:56,930 --> 01:46:59,230
Then I get a ride on the heart.

1408
01:46:59,350 --> 01:47:01,350
And not...

1409
01:47:02,270 --> 01:47:02,730
Oh.

1410
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:07,450
Whoops.

1411
01:47:12,070 --> 01:47:13,250
But where did it come from?

1412
01:47:13,410 --> 01:47:14,890
We'll never know.

1413
01:47:17,650 --> 01:47:21,490
Alright, drop down to take them out silently.

1414
01:47:22,050 --> 01:47:22,350
Okay.

1415
01:47:25,170 --> 01:47:27,490
He doesn't know.

1416
01:47:30,550 --> 01:47:32,150
Shhh, good night.

1417
01:47:35,050 --> 01:47:36,230
Hello, boys.

1418
01:47:36,590 --> 01:47:38,250
Who are you waiting for?

1419
01:47:43,170 --> 01:47:44,350
Nice, we did it.

1420
01:47:44,750 --> 01:47:46,350
Oh, I should have dived through the window.

1421
01:47:50,290 --> 01:47:52,810
I like the little oar walk that I do.

1422
01:47:54,150 --> 01:47:55,790
Wait, there's something over here.

1423
01:47:58,110 --> 01:47:59,250
I'm going to prevent access.

1424
01:47:59,370 --> 01:48:00,990
How do I access it, though?

1425
01:48:07,080 --> 01:48:07,800
Let's see.

1426
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:12,460
I feel like I don't have any of these things that they want me to do.

1427
01:48:14,520 --> 01:48:15,480
Yeah, I don't.

1428
01:48:18,020 --> 01:48:19,300
Oh, yeah, I can't do it now.

1429
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:21,220
Yeah, I was thinking, like, can I even do that now?

1430
01:48:26,680 --> 01:48:28,280
We make our own doors.

1431
01:48:30,820 --> 01:48:31,800
That's so dumb.

1432
01:48:33,280 --> 01:48:36,060
I like how they were like, oh, no, the door is locked.

1433
01:48:36,180 --> 01:48:37,260
What will we do?

1434
01:48:39,120 --> 01:48:40,080
Tell him he's fine.

1435
01:48:40,640 --> 01:48:41,960
No, don't tell him anything.

1436
01:48:42,660 --> 01:48:44,860
Well, tell him that you're not going to tell him about it.

1437
01:48:44,900 --> 01:48:45,520
She repeats.

1438
01:48:46,940 --> 01:48:51,200
Oh, it seemed like the new ones would say something new, but I guess not.

1439
01:48:54,760 --> 01:48:56,060
Wait, there's something up top.

1440
01:48:58,000 --> 01:48:58,880
What's this?

1441
01:49:01,700 --> 01:49:02,140
Uh.

1442
01:49:06,890 --> 01:49:07,750
My logo.

1443
01:49:08,290 --> 01:49:09,070
Oh, my God.

1444
01:49:09,310 --> 01:49:10,910
For God, he fucking draws his logo.

1445
01:49:11,210 --> 01:49:12,510
You do not need to draw.

1446
01:49:12,530 --> 01:49:35,730
logo a circle is fine Batman I am an artist I was gonna say what the fuck am I drawing a logo it says branding he

1447
01:49:40,740 --> 01:49:45,120
has to let them who's they I'm the only one you doing it?

1448
01:49:46,600 --> 01:49:48,520
I'm the only one that can see it.

1449
01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:49,980
Who the fuck is day?

1450
01:49:56,330 --> 01:49:58,210
I want to know if I had to go anywhere here.

1451
01:50:01,090 --> 01:50:03,870
I'm definitely going to forget all these controls when we do part two.

1452
01:50:03,990 --> 01:50:05,230
Chat, I can already feel it.

1453
01:50:07,930 --> 01:50:08,250
Hello.

1454
01:50:09,290 --> 01:50:11,230
I can do a silent takedown on this guy.

1455
01:50:11,790 --> 01:50:11,890
Oh.

1456
01:50:17,850 --> 01:50:18,650
Alright, nice.

1457
01:50:19,450 --> 01:50:21,870
I can do a double takedown on these guys.

1458
01:50:21,950 --> 01:50:24,550
Is that

1459
01:50:28,220 --> 01:50:28,900
all of them?

1460
01:50:33,270 --> 01:50:33,570
Oh wait.

1461
01:50:34,530 --> 01:50:35,330
I can go here.

1462
01:50:36,750 --> 01:50:37,950
And then drop attack!

1463
01:50:39,450 --> 01:50:41,190
And then away I go!

1464
01:50:41,230 --> 01:50:42,050
He's here!

1465
01:50:42,470 --> 01:50:43,450
Don't let him get in!

1466
01:50:43,910 --> 01:50:45,010
Drop attack!

1467
01:50:46,030 --> 01:50:47,970
And away I go!

1468
01:50:50,850 --> 01:50:52,450
Oh shit!

1469
01:50:53,110 --> 01:50:53,970
Drop attack!

1470
01:50:54,410 --> 01:50:56,010
And away I go!

1471
01:50:59,670 --> 01:51:02,050
He's like, where did he go?

1472
01:51:02,330 --> 01:51:03,030
Oh, please, please.

1473
01:51:04,270 --> 01:51:09,510
You gotta keep together.

1474
01:51:11,090 --> 01:51:12,770
Oh, but what if I...

1475
01:51:13,530 --> 01:51:14,770
Okay, maybe...

1476
01:51:16,470 --> 01:51:18,130
Yeah, I am, though.

1477
01:51:20,130 --> 01:51:24,260
You all wear nice little dresses.

1478
01:51:25,040 --> 01:51:26,600
Wait, what if I could just do this?

1479
01:51:28,780 --> 01:51:29,580
That's right.

1480
01:51:30,080 --> 01:51:30,300
Yoink.

1481
01:51:30,480 --> 01:51:30,920
Um, yum, yum.

1482
01:51:31,740 --> 01:51:32,760
Get over and fight up.

1483
01:51:32,980 --> 01:51:34,100
There's someone stuck up here.

1484
01:51:34,380 --> 01:51:35,000
Get over here.

1485
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:36,460
That's right.

1486
01:51:36,500 --> 01:51:37,440
Yeah, get over here.

1487
01:51:38,940 --> 01:51:39,220
Oh, wait.

1488
01:51:39,260 --> 01:51:39,960
How did he know?

1489
01:51:40,420 --> 01:51:41,320
Drop attack.

1490
01:51:41,440 --> 01:51:42,340
Oh, shit.

1491
01:51:42,660 --> 01:51:43,360
He's shocking.

1492
01:51:43,640 --> 01:51:44,340
Oh, shit.

1493
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:45,320
He has a gun.

1494
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:48,440
Drop attack.

1495
01:51:49,420 --> 01:51:49,820
Oh, my God.

1496
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:50,800
He has a gun.

1497
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:51,520
Oh, my God.

1498
01:51:51,700 --> 01:51:52,680
He has a gun.

1499
01:51:53,560 --> 01:51:54,580
Oh, thank God.

1500
01:51:55,520 --> 01:51:56,460
Time to die.

1501
01:51:56,780 --> 01:51:57,340
I got it.

1502
01:51:57,660 --> 01:51:59,980
Okay, I got the...

1503
01:51:59,980 --> 01:52:01,140
Smoke bomb!

1504
01:52:02,020 --> 01:52:03,460
Pocket sand!

1505
01:52:04,100 --> 01:52:07,780
Oh no, not the fucking bullets.

1506
01:52:08,740 --> 01:52:11,200
Don't worry, yeah, he doesn't know.

1507
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:12,580
You smoke to get away.

1508
01:52:13,280 --> 01:52:14,240
He doesn't know.

1509
01:52:14,500 --> 01:52:15,800
Fucking stupid.

1510
01:52:21,880 --> 01:52:22,520
Wee!

1511
01:52:25,800 --> 01:52:27,820
Stop letting him do that.

1512
01:52:28,200 --> 01:52:29,400
I really...

1513
01:52:30,580 --> 01:52:42,740
I gotta stop letting him do that They don't know They don't know Guys, how are you alive?

1514
01:52:46,820 --> 01:52:54,500
Okay, we'll go over here I'm 1 HP right now Guys, maybe I should have got the fucking unarmed shit

1515
01:52:57,880 --> 01:53:00,780
How the fuck was I supposed I'm supposed to know!

1516
01:53:01,360 --> 01:53:02,800
I don't one-shot!

1517
01:53:06,020 --> 01:53:07,280
Alright, I gotta watch this.

1518
01:53:07,400 --> 01:53:08,900
He's gotta go underneath me.

1519
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:10,840
And then I'm...

1520
01:53:10,840 --> 01:53:12,780
You look scared, boy.

1521
01:53:13,040 --> 01:53:14,340
I don't blame you.

1522
01:53:17,540 --> 01:53:19,180
Okay, that's not fair.

1523
01:53:20,940 --> 01:53:21,920
What's going on?

1524
01:53:22,100 --> 01:53:23,520
I thought we were in charge.

1525
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:28,560
Okay.

1526
01:53:30,860 --> 01:53:31,920
This was the only one.

Okay, there we go.

1530
01:54:08,540 --> 01:54:10,580
Yeah, now there's only one.

1531
01:54:10,900 --> 01:54:12,320
It was a miscount.

1532
01:54:13,340 --> 01:54:14,340
We did it, guys.

1533
01:54:15,340 --> 01:54:15,640
Whoops.

1534
01:54:16,160 --> 01:54:16,920

1535
01:54:17,940 --> 01:54:19,020
Okay, that doesn't work.

1536
01:54:19,180 --> 01:54:20,380
I thought it would cut it.

1537
01:54:21,620 --> 01:54:22,440
Can you stand?

1538
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:23,400
Give me a second.

1539
01:54:24,040 --> 01:54:25,120
What's wrong with these people?

1540
01:54:25,640 --> 01:54:27,520
That crazy woman thinks I can fix the Joker.

Remote electrical charge.

1543
01:55:31,960 --> 01:55:32,420
Non-lethal.

1544
01:55:32,600 --> 01:55:34,940
That's good to know that's non-lethal, Batman.

1545
01:55:37,340 --> 01:55:37,580
Alright.

1546
01:55:38,200 --> 01:55:39,600
Don't worry, it's non-lethal.

1547
01:55:44,380 --> 01:55:44,680
Okay.

1548
01:55:50,020 --> 01:55:52,400
I assume I have to use it for this.

1549
01:55:55,780 --> 01:55:56,900
Where's the gun?

1550
01:55:57,960 --> 01:55:58,440
Oh, there we go.

1551
01:55:58,720 --> 01:56:02,480
I should head back to the loading bay.

1552
01:56:02,900 --> 01:56:04,220
It's the only route to Joker.

1553
01:56:05,460 --> 01:56:06,500
The loading bay.

1554
01:56:14,350 --> 01:56:16,250
Oh, I have to just go this way.

1555
01:56:24,280 --> 01:56:24,760
Oh, hey.

1556
01:56:30,680 --> 01:56:32,080
Why does this do?

1557
01:56:32,680 --> 01:56:34,360
Oh, does this push it?

1558
01:56:40,080 --> 01:56:42,620
Oh, that pushes it.

1559
01:56:42,720 --> 01:56:43,180
Oh.

1560
01:56:43,900 --> 01:56:44,640
Oh, okay.

1561
01:56:46,660 --> 01:56:48,940
Okay, I shoot the Harley bots now.

1562
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:52,800
Oh, oh my god.

1563
01:56:53,600 --> 01:56:54,920
I need to get back after Joker.

1564
01:56:57,360 --> 01:56:57,680
Alright.

1565
01:57:00,540 --> 01:57:01,900
Oh, is that for the trophy?

1566
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:03,200
I didn't even notice it.

1567
01:57:03,260 --> 01:57:03,980
Not gonna lie.

1568
01:57:07,780 --> 01:57:08,820
Okay, then...

1569
01:57:08,820 --> 01:57:10,220
Can we go this way?

1570
01:57:13,640 --> 01:57:15,140
Okay, I have to go backtrack.

1571
01:57:15,160 --> 01:57:43,020

Oh, okay, RB.

1574
01:57:56,080 --> 01:57:59,580
I don't even know when it's RB and when it's RT.

1575
01:58:00,860 --> 01:58:01,840
Or is this trial and error?

1576
01:58:08,640 --> 01:58:09,540
Oh my god.

1577
01:58:10,020 --> 01:58:12,040
Why are they all so stupid?

1578
01:58:12,360 --> 01:58:17,600
Why do I activate that?

1579
01:58:17,980 --> 01:58:18,960
Why do I activate that?

1580
01:58:19,440 --> 01:58:20,000
Why?

1581
01:58:20,200 --> 01:58:21,260
You're chicken.

1582
01:58:22,400 --> 01:58:24,400
Well, you two just shut the hell up and get ready.

1583
01:58:25,220 --> 01:58:27,360
I don't like this any more than you do.

1584
01:58:27,540 --> 01:58:28,900
But if we got one now.

1585
01:58:29,080 --> 01:58:29,420
Look out!

1586
01:58:29,680 --> 01:58:30,140
That bitch!

1587
01:58:35,360 --> 01:58:35,760
Okay.

1588
01:58:40,540 --> 01:58:40,940
Okay.

1589
01:58:47,400 --> 01:58:47,800
That's...

1590
01:58:47,800 --> 01:58:49,000
Wait, does that kill?

1591
01:58:49,260 --> 01:58:50,040
Does that kill?

1592
01:58:50,200 --> 01:58:51,360
Or is it just a stun?

1593
01:58:54,040 --> 01:58:56,500
It said non-lethal, guys.

1594
01:59:00,820 --> 01:59:01,140
Wait.

1595
01:59:01,400 --> 01:59:02,400
Now do that with what?

1596
01:59:02,520 --> 01:59:03,500
Wait, what does that do?

1597
01:59:07,310 --> 01:59:08,590
I'm just curious.

1598
01:59:10,270 --> 01:59:11,350
It said non-lethal.

1599
01:59:11,610 --> 01:59:13,130
Oh, shit, he threw it.

1600
01:59:13,670 --> 01:59:15,030
Oh, is it just a stun?

1601
01:59:15,150 --> 01:59:17,110
Aw, that's unlucky.

1602
01:59:19,050 --> 01:59:20,010
It was...

1603
01:59:20,010 --> 01:59:21,850
It was...

1604
01:59:21,950 --> 01:59:24,410
I'm just thinking, that would be pretty funny.

1605
01:59:25,470 --> 01:59:28,290
They said non-lethal, so I was testing it out.

1606
01:59:28,450 --> 01:59:29,950
How lethal it was.

1607
01:59:35,130 --> 01:59:35,450
Okay.

1608
01:59:35,930 --> 01:59:37,390
Just get him out of here, then.

1609
01:59:39,830 --> 01:59:41,610
It's just a little taser.

1610
01:59:45,570 --> 01:59:48,050
How the fuck do I get this shit going?

1611
01:59:52,300 --> 01:59:55,540
Ah, I have to use the batter and...

1612
02:00:00,290 --> 02:00:01,610
Is there anything?

1613
02:00:03,850 --> 02:00:05,170
Alright, there you go.

1614
02:00:09,220 --> 02:00:11,480
Okay, oh my gosh, all the way back here.

1615
02:00:14,440 --> 02:00:15,780
Oh, wait, there's one here.

1616
02:00:18,560 --> 02:00:19,880
Oh, wait, not the explosives, Joe.

1617
02:00:22,380 --> 02:00:23,060
Wait, is that not?

1618
02:00:23,460 --> 02:00:23,620
Oh.

1619
02:00:24,460 --> 02:00:25,580
That wasn't it.

1620
02:00:28,300 --> 02:00:29,820
I thought there was one over here.

1621
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:30,380
Okay.

1622
02:00:43,940 --> 02:00:45,420
All right, this way.

1623
02:00:57,420 --> 02:00:58,360
Wasn't there like...

1624
02:00:58,360 --> 02:01:00,720
Yeah, I was like, remember there was one here.

1625
02:01:04,620 --> 02:01:05,180
No!

1626
02:01:06,780 --> 02:01:08,440
I didn't think she would talk!

1627
02:01:09,060 --> 02:01:10,480
She would stop talking!

1628
02:01:19,490 --> 02:01:20,050
Not...

1629
02:01:21,890 --> 02:01:25,170
I was not supposed to I should stop talking.

1630
02:01:29,100 --> 02:01:30,020
There we go.

1631
02:01:31,740 --> 02:01:33,360
I scared her away!

1632
02:01:33,860 --> 02:01:35,620
I was trying to zap her.

1633
02:01:37,780 --> 02:01:38,880
Did I do it again?

1634
02:01:44,280 --> 02:01:45,400
Oh, there's more.

1635
02:01:51,710 --> 02:01:52,830
Where does this go?

1636
02:01:54,910 --> 02:01:55,990
I have to dislodge.

1637
02:01:56,110 --> 02:01:56,830
Yeah, I'm going to say that.

1638
02:01:56,970 --> 02:01:58,350
I feel like I dislodge it.

1639
02:02:01,810 --> 02:02:02,590
There we go.

It's just nothing.

1644
02:03:14,640 --> 02:03:18,670
There's no place to find you.

1645
02:03:19,070 --> 02:03:21,170
And bait the living crap out of you.

1646

Okay, now I did something.

1649
02:03:32,430 --> 02:03:33,710
That's crazy.

1650
02:03:34,890 --> 02:03:36,190

02:04:22,370 --> 02:04:23,370
Wait, he's actually dead.

02:04:23,570 --> 02:04:24,670

02:04:28,250 --> 02:04:35,660
Leave us- just leave me with him.

1661
02:04:36,100 --> 02:04:37,420
I said blue.

1662
02:04:38,200 --> 02:04:41,380

You fell for the old fake Joker gang, Batman!

1666
02:05:04,320 --> 02:05:05,520
Satter up!

1667
02:05:07,820 --> 02:05:08,960
He's alive!

1668
02:05:13,540 --> 02:05:16,160
For how many fuck- Get jokered?

1669
02:05:16,180 --> 02:05:18,020
The detective will be busy with the Joker for a while.

1670
02:05:18,640 --> 02:05:18,980
Good.

1671
02:05:20,880 --> 02:05:23,920

1673

Poison Ivy?

1674

She's here?

1675
02:05:57,940 --> 02:05:58,940
Oh my god!

1676
02:05:59,160 --> 02:06:01,000
I need to get my kit for my apartment.

1677
02:06:01,640 --> 02:06:02,200
Okay.

1678
02:06:03,840 --> 02:06:05,840
Alright, I guess I'll go back to my apartment.

1679
02:06:06,160 --> 02:06:06,600
Never mind.

1680
02:06:07,220 --> 02:06:12,420
I thought we're gonna have some exciting catfight.

1681
02:06:14,100 --> 02:06:15,560
It's a girl's day.

1682
02:06:20,170 --> 02:06:25,190
But Tanya's Pamela was transformed by a science spirit gone wrong into a planned human hybrid.

1683
02:06:25,950 --> 02:06:26,950
No, that's hard.

1684
02:06:26,970 --> 02:06:57,910

1685
02:06:59,210 --> 02:07:03,850
Taking refuge in a vine-covered stronghold, Ivy would rather keep you mad anyway than participate in a Ganwar.

1686
02:07:04,030 --> 02:07:06,950
Alright, I'm going to use a bathroom real quick before we do this.

1687
02:07:07,050 --> 02:07:07,550
I'll be back.

1688
02:07:30,260 --> 02:07:31,940
This place is falling apart.

1689
02:07:32,280 --> 02:07:33,020
There's no food.

1690
02:07:33,280 --> 02:07:34,480
Everyone hates each other.

1691
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:36,680
Strange just keeps talking.

1692
02:08:03,570 --> 02:08:08,610
If I ever get the chance to get close to Strange, I'm taking the pick down.

1693
02:08:14,280 --> 02:08:14,600
...

1694
02:08:29,880 --> 02:08:30,400
...

1695
02:09:28,370 --> 02:09:29,890
I'm back.

1696
02:09:30,470 --> 02:09:31,930
What does Mr. Strange say?

1697
02:09:33,730 --> 02:09:35,330
Any special treatment?

1698
02:09:35,430 --> 02:09:36,530
No special treatment?

1699
02:09:37,190 --> 02:09:38,350
That's fucked up.

1700
02:09:38,670 --> 02:09:39,910
Let me double check some stuff.

1701
02:09:41,330 --> 02:09:42,570

02:09:42,730 --> 02:09:43,130

1708
02:09:53,650 --> 02:09:54,170
Alright.

1709
02:09:54,390 --> 02:09:56,470
I gotta find my fucking apartment apparently.

1710
02:09:57,430 --> 02:09:57,430
Okay.

1711
02:10:00,430 --> 02:10:01,690
Oh my god.

1712
02:10:01,770 --> 02:10:02,250
It's my whip.

1713
02:10:02,330 --> 02:10:02,670
Whatcha.

1714
02:10:03,350 --> 02:10:03,970
That's cool.

1715
02:10:04,430 --> 02:10:05,830
I like that.

1716
02:10:06,730 --> 02:10:07,750
Oh my god, look at me, girl.

1717
02:10:08,710 --> 02:10:11,850
I might not be able to glide, but look at my fucking whip.

1718
02:10:14,490 --> 02:10:15,810
Oh my god, I'm actually like a cat.

1719
02:10:16,150 --> 02:10:17,770
It's like I'm catwoman or some shit.

1720
02:10:19,570 --> 02:10:20,530
Yeah, I live here.

1721
02:10:21,770 --> 02:10:24,710
God, red at Gotham City must be so fucking cheap.

1722
02:10:27,330 --> 02:10:31,370
Isn't like metropolis like sort of like next door to Gotham City?

1723
02:10:33,770 --> 02:10:36,470
Or is that just from the Harley Quinn show?

1724
02:10:36,470 --> 02:10:37,890
I was supposed to find out where she lives anyway.

1725
02:10:38,910 --> 02:10:41,570
Two-face said she lives somewhere near here.

1726
02:10:42,870 --> 02:10:44,170
Where is my house?

1727
02:10:45,410 --> 02:10:45,850
Like here?

1728
02:10:45,850 --> 02:10:46,770
I don't question the boss.

1729
02:10:47,010 --> 02:10:47,690
You shouldn't either.

1730
02:10:48,850 --> 02:10:49,730
I know, I know.

1731
02:10:50,210 --> 02:10:52,050
But I'll get me so pissed all of a sudden anyway.

1732
02:10:54,170 --> 02:10:55,610
Oh my god!

1733
02:10:55,990 --> 02:10:56,970
Oh my god!

1734
02:10:57,110 --> 02:10:57,550
Hoocha!

1735
02:10:58,850 --> 02:10:59,370
Hoocha!

1736
02:11:00,710 --> 02:11:01,230
Hoocha!

1737
02:11:01,830 --> 02:11:02,050

That's right.

1741
02:11:05,610 --> 02:11:07,790
It doesn't stop, boys.

1742
02:11:11,770 --> 02:11:13,210
That's right.

1743
02:11:16,370 --> 02:11:18,330
It should have been me.

1744
02:11:21,610 --> 02:11:24,290
That's why it never stops.

1745
02:11:25,950 --> 02:11:26,970
I don't think this kills.

1746
02:11:27,170 --> 02:11:28,630
I think this just stuns.

1747
02:11:31,270 --> 02:11:33,330

1753
02:12:12,290 --> 02:12:14,310
It's good to be home.

1754
02:12:16,710 --> 02:12:17,730
Enough crack whips.

1755
02:12:18,230 --> 02:12:19,910
It's Johnny Test time.

1756
02:12:20,090 --> 02:12:21,690
This is a Johnny Test episode.

1757
02:12:23,290 --> 02:12:23,810
Calatrops.

1758
02:12:24,150 --> 02:12:27,950
An entire personnel device used to lead traps for unsuspecting enemies.

1759
02:12:28,110 --> 02:12:31,110
Anyone walking over there will be tripped up and fell out to the ground.

1760
02:12:32,650 --> 02:12:33,090
Alright.

1761
02:12:33,350 --> 02:12:35,790

02:12:35,790 --> 02:12:37,170
It's to knock down enemies.

1763
02:12:37,270 --> 02:12:38,370
Oh, is that my Batterans?

1764
02:12:38,750 --> 02:12:39,730
Time to find Ivy.

1765
02:12:40,490 --> 02:12:43,510
Pounds when under mesh ceiling.

1766
02:12:43,810 --> 02:12:44,850
Holy shit.

1767
02:12:45,870 --> 02:12:48,010
Okay, that's not even anything related.

1768
02:12:48,110 --> 02:12:50,090

1778
02:13:08,110 --> 02:13:09,730

Wee!

1785
02:13:33,350 --> 02:13:35,150
Like, nah, I've seen a cat.

1786
02:13:35,530 --> 02:13:45,290
Like, if a cat is fucking climbing up the grates like that, I would, like, I would call a scientist.

1787
02:13:45,930 --> 02:13:48,890
Like, this is a fucking scientific discovery right there.

1788
02:13:52,190 --> 02:13:52,750
Bye.

1789
02:13:53,090 --> 02:13:53,630
Bye.

1790
02:13:54,650 --> 02:13:55,870

1795
02:14:05,270 --> 02:14:07,210
We gotta breed that cat to make...

1796
02:14:07,210 --> 02:14:08,630
Oh shit, cats can't swim!

1797
02:14:09,210 --> 02:14:09,450
Alright.

1798
02:14:10,110 --> 02:14:11,830
To make more of these spotted cats.

1799
02:14:12,010 --> 02:14:12,530
What do we have here?

1800
02:14:13,130 --> 02:14:15,170
Weird out of place plants, check.

1801
02:14:15,650 --> 02:14:17,670
Mindless hypnotized henchmen, check.

1802
02:14:18,230 --> 02:14:22,170
The oh so subtle odor of rotting pumpkins, check.

1803
02:14:22,630 --> 02:14:23,330
Looks like...

1804
02:14:23,330 --> 02:14:23,950
And she smells like pumpkins?

1805
02:14:24,550 --> 02:14:25,850
...to Ivy's lair.

1806
02:14:27,870 --> 02:14:28,550
Alright.

1807
02:14:34,450 --> 02:14:35,270
Oh, Jesus.

1808
02:14:39,870 --> 02:14:41,450
Oh, my God.

1809
02:14:42,290 --> 02:14:43,730

1812
02:14:47,150 --> 02:14:47,590
Oh, my God.

1813
02:14:47,710 --> 02:14:48,390
Give me a sec.

1814
02:14:48,550 --> 02:14:50,150
I'm trying to use my whip right now.

1815
02:14:50,270 --> 02:14:51,050
It's not working.

1816
02:14:51,930 --> 02:14:52,310
All right.

1817
02:14:54,130 --> 02:14:54,710
All right.

1818
02:14:54,870 --> 02:14:55,850
You can watch.

1819
02:14:59,890 --> 02:15:01,850
You can watch if you want.

1820
02:15:04,850 --> 02:15:07,490
God, I wish that were me.

1821
02:15:11,170 --> 02:15:12,370
Yeah, I go this way.

1822
02:15:16,070 --> 02:15:17,370
Hold and swing down.

02:15:18,170 --> 02:15:21,770
Oh, Jesus Christ, it's so dumb.

1824
02:15:23,710 --> 02:15:25,510

02:18:53,280 --> 02:18:53,740
That's all.

1879
02:18:53,820 --> 02:18:57,480
If you're still breathing, it's not over.

1880
02:19:00,140 --> 02:19:01,020
She's consistent.

1881
02:19:01,360 --> 02:19:02,540
I'll give her that.

1882
02:19:02,920 --> 02:19:07,640
A billion microorganisms will enter your bloodstream.

1883
02:19:07,960 --> 02:19:10,920
Okay, but we already have microplastics from what we learned today.

1884
02:19:11,840 --> 02:19:12,820
Is it really...

1885
02:19:12,820 --> 02:19:13,780
Oh, wait, what?

1886
02:19:13,980 --> 02:19:18,660
When I'm done, your flesh will be replaced with butter.

1887
02:19:19,280 --> 02:19:20,420
What is this combo?

1888
02:19:21,760 --> 02:19:23,800
Oh my god, wait, I have like a double...

1889
02:19:23,820 --> 02:19:26,100
Oh, shit, Ivy.

1890
02:19:26,620 --> 02:19:27,940
I mean, the cat woman.

1891
02:19:32,980 --> 02:19:34,020
That's fast.

1892
02:19:34,200 --> 02:19:35,140
Wait, where do I go?

1893
02:19:36,060 --> 02:19:36,720
Oh, there she is.

1894
02:19:37,340 --> 02:19:38,440
I just need your help.

1895
02:19:39,560 --> 02:19:39,700
Never.

1896
02:19:40,560 --> 02:19:41,520
Not again.

1897
02:19:43,880 --> 02:19:45,360
Look, I can get you Harley.

1898
02:19:46,600 --> 02:19:49,060
You've got some nerve, Selena.

1899
02:19:52,700 --> 02:19:53,980
Oh, I don't like this.

1900
02:19:55,580 --> 02:19:57,940
Wait, I've seen this situation before.

1901
02:20:00,160 --> 02:20:00,700
Oh,

1902
02:20:03,760 --> 02:20:04,280
you're right.

1903
02:20:04,500 --> 02:20:06,720
I forgot because I'm Catwoman.

1904
02:20:09,300 --> 02:20:10,580
Oh, wait, it's too late.

1905
02:20:11,140 --> 02:20:16,840
No one's who you think they are, my dear.

1906
02:20:17,060 --> 02:20:18,480
Why spoil the fun?

1907
02:20:19,320 --> 02:20:21,140
I've seen this in Japanese before.

1908
02:20:21,840 --> 02:20:23,460
There's nothing wrong with you.

1909
02:20:23,880 --> 02:20:27,400
Nice of you to say, but you of all people should do.

1910
02:20:28,180 --> 02:21:28,600
there's plenty oh take my blood for example i wish somebody would this stuff is killing me why should i wait is this blood transfusion there's a teeny little bit of me and you too oh my god he fucking gave me his blood that is fucked up don't tell me it's not what you always wanted look bro he's inside me time I need your help I nearly had a cure it was so close and then it was taken this is like my toxic galley both die I'm fine with that are you imagine sucking down that last breath knowing that Gotham is doing the same oh so he gave him his blood so he'll have to find a cure I've spent weeks shipping samples of my blood to emergency rooms oh that's why the doctor I'm going crazy!

1911
02:21:30,840 --> 02:21:32,900
That's so fucked up!

1912
02:21:33,260 --> 02:21:35,760
Yes, he's a universal blood donor.

1913
02:21:35,940 --> 02:21:37,140
Never heard of it.

1914
02:21:37,600 --> 02:21:39,100
Hold tight.

1915
02:21:40,180 --> 02:21:42,180
That's so fucked!

1916
02:21:46,860 --> 02:21:47,740
Jesus!

1917
02:21:54,850 --> 02:21:57,470
The live chock-joker reaction.

1918
02:21:57,850 --> 02:22:00,070
Is someone feeling a little down?

1919
02:22:00,930 --> 02:22:01,950
What do you want?

1920
02:22:02,110 --> 02:22:03,310
Oh, that's just...

1921
02:22:03,330 --> 02:22:03,890
You're up!

1922
02:22:04,150 --> 02:22:05,250
You won't kill you.

1923
02:22:09,670 --> 02:22:10,430
Where is the cure?

1924
02:22:11,150 --> 02:22:11,790
Who has it?

1925
02:22:11,930 --> 02:22:15,390
I had our cold-hearted friend, Mr. Freeze, making it.

1926
02:22:15,890 --> 02:22:17,730
But he's gonna talk on me.

1927
02:22:18,290 --> 02:22:19,090
I'll find him.

1928
02:22:19,310 --> 02:22:20,610
I bet you...

1929
02:22:20,610 --> 02:22:20,950
Oh.

1930
02:22:27,470 --> 02:22:29,230
That's a little rude, Batman.

1931
02:22:30,650 --> 02:22:32,410
Alfred, Joker's poisoned me.

1932
02:22:32,930 --> 02:22:34,230
He may have poisoned Gotham, too.

1933
02:22:35,010 --> 02:22:36,510
Mr. Freeze has the only cure.

1934
02:22:38,410 --> 02:23:09,570
he zinged him if only it was that simple he'll be somewhere cold he needs to be kept at sub-zero temperatures to survive i don't wish to worry you i feel like he shouldn't be able to be outside heat signatures i'll find the coldest point in arkham city all right mr freeze i also forgot what he looks like i guess dr victor fries wait his last name is

1935
02:23:13,810 --> 02:24:09,590

1936
02:24:11,210 --> 02:24:11,930
Nora, no!

1937
02:24:13,930 --> 02:24:15,350
Okay, we gotta find...

1938
02:24:15,670 --> 02:24:17,690
We gotta find a colder place.

1939
02:24:19,370 --> 02:24:20,410
Just like here.

1940
02:24:24,110 --> 02:24:25,350
Oh, this way.

1941
02:24:27,050 --> 02:24:28,590
Give me a sec, guys.

1942
02:24:29,870 --> 02:24:31,670
I'm poisoned right now.

1943
02:24:31,830 --> 02:24:33,250
Gotta find the coldest point.

1944
02:24:33,710 --> 02:24:35,690
Freeze's lab must be this way.

1945
02:24:35,970 --> 02:24:38,130
I'm definitely heading toward the coldest point.

1946
02:24:38,590 --> 02:24:39,250
Wee!

1947
02:24:39,510 --> 02:24:43,590
Well, I can't believe I didn't think of this earlier.

1948
02:24:44,010 --> 02:24:46,730
A hotline straight to my nest as

1949
02:24:51,170 --> 02:24:52,010
far as...

1950
02:24:52,010 --> 02:24:53,490
Well, he asked my number now.

1951
02:24:53,610 --> 02:24:55,670
I think our relationship is really...

1952
02:24:57,910 --> 02:24:58,290
Whoa.

1953
02:25:04,450 --> 02:25:04,870
Damn.

1954
02:25:05,390 --> 02:25:06,290
Damn Joker.

1955
02:25:06,730 --> 02:25:08,530
A distress flare on this rooftop.

1956
02:25:09,510 --> 02:25:11,790
Either someone inside needs my help, or it's a trap.

1957
02:25:12,490 --> 02:25:13,530
What is this, Quest?

1958
02:25:28,680 --> 02:25:30,640
Oh my god, touch.

1959
02:25:30,700 --> 02:25:31,180
Stop.

1960
02:25:31,800 --> 02:25:33,260
Thank you for the super chat.

1961
02:25:33,580 --> 02:25:33,820
Thank you.

1962
02:25:34,100 --> 02:25:34,620
Thank you.

1963
02:25:44,260 --> 02:25:45,860
Oh, that's...

1964
02:25:46,500 --> 02:25:46,880
Hmm.

1965
02:25:49,360 --> 02:25:52,160
But it's not the coldest point, though.

1966
02:25:52,520 --> 02:25:53,380
That's the thing.

1967
02:25:55,100 --> 02:25:57,860
Freeze must be using one of the old forensic labs.

1968
02:25:58,240 --> 02:25:59,060
I've got to get in there.

1969
02:25:59,300 --> 02:26:00,440
Look, I can save him.

1970
02:26:00,700 --> 02:26:01,500
Next time.

1971
02:26:01,640 --> 02:26:03,860
This is not as important.

1972
02:26:05,740 --> 02:26:06,580
So what now?

1973
02:26:07,100 --> 02:26:08,440
You two keep trying to get in.

1974
02:26:08,760 --> 02:26:10,200
I'll blow their faces off it.

1975
02:26:12,780 --> 02:26:13,860
Where's there?

1976
02:26:15,380 --> 02:26:15,840
Oops.

1977
02:26:16,540 --> 02:26:17,160
I leave.

1978
02:26:18,240 --> 02:26:18,800
Did I?

1979
02:26:20,440 --> 02:26:21,520
Oh shit.

1980
02:26:21,700 --> 02:26:22,420
Wait, what?

1981
02:26:23,220 --> 02:26:23,980
Oh shit!

1982
02:26:27,360 --> 02:26:27,960
Wee!

1983
02:26:29,020 --> 02:26:30,560
How did you miss?

1984
02:26:31,900 --> 02:26:32,860
Smoke pellet!

1985
02:26:33,040 --> 02:26:34,520
But first, let me kill you.

1986
02:26:35,160 --> 02:26:35,780
There you go.

1987
02:26:38,080 --> 02:26:39,520
What the fuck is it?

1988
02:26:42,460 --> 02:26:43,700
Oh, shit!

1989
02:26:44,200 --> 02:26:45,260
What the fuck?

1990
02:26:45,400 --> 02:26:46,960
Where did all of them come from?

1991
02:26:47,420 --> 02:26:50,200
Trying to find the coldest point here, bro.

1992
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:55,920
Where the hell did he go?

1993
02:26:56,320 --> 02:26:57,360
That's a good question.

1994
02:26:58,220 --> 02:26:58,600
Yoink.

1995
02:27:02,580 --> 02:27:03,600
Is it below me?

1996
02:27:03,720 --> 02:27:04,660
Alright, let me kill these guys.

1997
02:27:04,680 --> 02:27:05,600
guys first.

1998
02:27:06,540 --> 02:27:06,880
Never mind.

1999
02:27:07,120 --> 02:27:08,920
They're, like, way too far from me.

2000
02:27:15,750 --> 02:27:17,290
They're trying to break in here?

2001
02:27:17,590 --> 02:27:18,690
Oh, I guess, like, here.

2002
02:27:19,550 --> 02:27:21,650
Wait, oh my god, there's so many dead bodies.

2003
02:27:25,890 --> 02:27:30,430
Batarum, batarum, batarum, batarum, batarum, batarum, batarum, batarum, batarum, batarum.

2004
02:27:30,570 --> 02:27:32,690
There seems to be a camera malfunction in sector 3.

2005
02:27:33,610 --> 02:27:34,010
Yep.

2006
02:27:34,410 --> 02:27:35,590
Camera malfunction.

2007
02:27:37,670 --> 02:27:38,070
Yeah.

2008
02:27:40,590 --> 02:27:41,290
There we go.

2009
02:27:41,450 --> 02:27:42,510
Got in.

2010
02:27:46,970 --> 02:27:48,750
I did not get in.

2011
02:27:49,270 --> 02:27:52,550
Wait, how do I disarm them?

2012
02:27:53,610 --> 02:27:53,790
Okay.

2013
02:27:55,330 --> 02:27:56,150
There we go.

2014
02:27:56,890 --> 02:27:59,630
There we go.

2015
02:28:00,830 --> 02:28:02,050
No more guns for you.

2016
02:28:02,150 --> 02:28:03,590
Wait, how did he get his guns back?

2017
02:28:03,870 --> 02:28:05,970
I said no more guns for you.

2018
02:28:07,350 --> 02:28:09,290
Oh my god, please don't shoot me while I do this.

2019
02:28:11,750 --> 02:28:42,630

Thank you.

Thank you.

02:30:18,870 --> 02:30:20,470
But thank you, everyone, for coming.

2031
02:30:20,610 --> 02:30:22,370
I always love streaming.

2032
02:30:22,530 --> 02:30:25,770
I always love playing video games, but I mean, yeah, I mean, sorry.

2033
02:30:26,130 --> 02:30:27,930
I always love streaming for you guys.

2034
02:30:28,310 --> 02:30:29,270
So it's been fun.

2035
02:30:29,410 --> 02:30:30,730
It's been a great first part.

2036
02:30:31,570 --> 02:30:33,990
I definitely won't do a longer stream for a part two.

2037
02:30:34,090 --> 02:30:35,690
I just been a little eepy today.

2038
02:30:36,450 --> 02:30:39,690
So I decided to not really do this morning stream as well.

2039
02:30:39,930 --> 02:30:41,970
So I was like, I gotta relax a little.

2040
02:30:42,070 --> 02:31:02,650
For those who don't know, we might have to change the game tomorrow because apparently the game Severance isn't out yet for tomorrow because there was an error on Steam or some shit for this game that they had to re-upload the game on Steam and then they don't check,

2041
02:31:02,990 --> 02:31:45,790
they don't like, they don't check the game, the checks i guess on the weekend so it might not be released tomorrow so we we're trying to figure out what game to play for tomorrow as like a backup uh but yeah just letting you guys know that like we might have to change the game because most likely won't be released by tomorrow um anyway guys uh as always everybody stay hydrated posh check get up and move around to get that blood pumping pumping get up everywhere get that blood pumping and if you stay up for me head to bed because you deserve it i'll see you guys next time everybody uh bye guys bye
