00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:50,630
Yo

2
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,970
Hello everybody, I'm sorry.

3
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,870
I was gonna stream earlier.

4
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:01,870
I'm sorry.

5
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:06,470
I had work caught up to me and I had to do some work stuff.

6
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:10,370
Also, I ate my... I didn't tell you guys this before.

7
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:14,730
But, um, I didn't eat until...

8
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,730
Okay, I didn't even have... I didn't eat before my stream.

9
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,730
Before the April 1st stream.

10
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:24,250
And then, the Box stream, and then I didn't eat until 9.

11
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:27,170
Until 8pm.

12
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:33,250
So I had my first meal at 8pm.

13
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:36,630
And I got caught up with some stuff and now I'm here.

14
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,690
Playing my favorite game.

15
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,270
Where did I put my fish?

16
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,710
Is this my fish?

17
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:12,650
Oh, there's my fish.

18
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:13,510
Okay, give me a sec.

19
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:14,650
There we go.

20
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:16,350
Wait, I fucked it up.

21
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:17,310
Oh, give me a sec.

22
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:18,990
There we go.

23
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:19,670
Wait, where?

24
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,510
Where'd my fish go?

25
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:23,290
Oh, okay.

26
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:24,550
Oh, no.

27
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,030
What if I have to press that button?

28
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,250
Oh my- okay, it's okay.

29
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,710
The fish might randomly pop up.

30
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,130
It's the- it's the wild, wild west.

31
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,170
Look, there's my fish.

32
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:33,970
Om nom.

33
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:34,090
Om nom.

34
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,390
Om nom nom.

35
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,150
Om nom.

36
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:43,690
MHCup!

37
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:44,990
Thank you for the Twitch Prime!

38
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,350
Thank you!

39
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:50,050
I ate nothing but my fish and my dinner.

40
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:52,790
Thank you guys!

41
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:53,450
Yes.

42
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:58,950
I still have a couple more hours left to go on my quota.

43
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:00,930
So, well not a couple.

44
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,050
I have nine more hours left to go.

45
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:04,550
Or eight.

46
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:05,310
I lost track.

47
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:06,630
It's either nine or eight.

48
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:10,830
So, if I do end, I'm using- I'm gonna be on my alt account.

49
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:14,170
As you can see, I'm on Don King Kong.

50
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:19,750
I am on Don King Kong today.

51
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:23,810
Because I don't feel like testing the main.

52
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,910
I don't- I don't know.

53
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:29,790
I don't know how the games are gonna be like on the main today.

54
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:33,370
So, I decided to be on Don King Kong.

55
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:37,290
I also don't think I'm like- I- I don't know.

56
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:41,490
Right now, my mind is not ready to like be a gamer.

57
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:42,570
I'm just here.

58
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:43,950
I'm just a cat.

59
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:44,730
I'm Doe Kitty.

60
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:53,510
I just- I'm just running away from my taxes right now.

61
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:54,890
That's why I'm here.

62
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,570
That's why I'm here.

63
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,850
I'm not here- I'm not here to try too hard.

64
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:03,030
I'm here to- to- to- what is it called?

65
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,350
To people watch today.

66
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,870
It's not that late yet.

67
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:12,710
You know, usually the best time to watch the people watch is usually at like 3- when it starts being like 3 in the morning.

68
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:17,770
3 to 4 in the morning is when it's best to see like how degenerate the rank queues get.

69
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:20,190
So like, there's still some normal people out there.

70
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:23,910
There's still some normal people playing rank at the moment.

71
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,170
That's okay.

72
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:28,730
Alright, we're gonna warm up with some quick play- woah, okay, that was fast.

73
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,850
I was not expecting that.

74
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,240
Doe Kitty doesn't wanna do taxes right now.

75
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,320
Doe Kitty just wants to be a cat.

76
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,400
That plays Marvel Rivals.

77
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:46,480
And play DPS before she gets locked up in support jail.

78
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,960
Willingly locked up, by the way.

79
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,540
I put myself in that jail.

80
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:54,380
I- I put myself in that jail and threw away the key.

81
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,280
Don't let me out.

82
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:03,300
Don't- Doe Kitty is rea- Doe Kitty is not ready to commit tax evasion.

83
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,860
I am absolutely not ready for that.

84
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:11,620
That's exactly why I'm so fucking stressed out about my taxes.

85
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,660
Oh, I have yet to write my physical letter to my stupid tax center.

86
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:18,780
Alright.

87
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,280
The one time I get to play DPS.

88
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,880
Oh my god, I have to- Guys, I told you, I'm not writing it today.

89
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,300
I went through so much today, guys.

90
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,500
I am not mentally ready to fucking write a letter.

91
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,640
Also, for those who are wondering if I'm stacking with anybody.

92
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,220
No, I'm still loading right now.

93
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,620
I'm gonna see if I can kidnap anybody.

94
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,440
Like a random- not random person.

95
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,820
Maybe like, I don't know.

96
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:52,560
Let me see if I can- maybe someone will wanna let me kidnap them.

97
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,980
Just like how we kidnapped Choppa.

98
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,480
Wait, I'm throwing?

99
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,180
It's quick play.

100
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,000
It's- it's quick play, guys.

101
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:10,200
Nobody is- nobody's throwing because technically we're all throwing if you think about it.

102
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,360
Wait, where are they?

103
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,360
Oh, they're downstairs?

104
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:20,420
Oh my god, someone that doesn't wanna play high ground?

105
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,980
That's crazy.

106
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,640
Not playing high ground.

107
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,620
Oh my god.

108
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:27,720
Oh.

109
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,640
Okay.

110
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,260
This is- oh.

111
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,340
Goodbye.

112
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,260
I mean, I got the support.

113
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,400
So are they gonna do the rest of their jobs?

114
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,120
Yippee!

115
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,100
No one wants to be on point?

116
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:44,920
That's okay.

117
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,080
I'm like, okay.

118
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,480
Are they just gonna- okay.

119
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,520
You're really just gonna chill there?

120
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,780
That's fine.

121
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,340
Okay.

122
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,160
You're just gonna chill there.

123
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:00,920
Oh, Luna.

124
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,160
What you doing?

125
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:02,960
Oh, Luna.

126
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,080
That's- oh, okay, nevermind.

127
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:05,880
Your Starlord's coming.

128
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,220
I was gonna say, that's sad, Luna.

129
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,440
Your Captain America fucking left you.

130
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,100
Oh, shit.

131
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,020
Do I have healers?

132
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,180
Oh, I do.

133
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,660
It's just quick play.

134
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,160
Alright, nice.

135
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:28,440
Wow, it feels so good to be- to actually be, like, decent at DPS when my enemy is just Bronze players.

136
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:29,460
Wow.

137
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,080
Oh my god.

138
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:39,800
Oh my god, so this is what it's like to feel like you're actually a good DPS player.

139
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:43,830
Okay.

140
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,770
Oh, that is- where the fuck did his supports go?

141
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,170
Get over here.

142
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,910
Get your ass over here.

143
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:52,470
Oh, wait.

144
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:53,090
JK.

145
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:53,910
Not you.

146
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:57,430
Not you.

147
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,070
Wait, where- where is he?

148
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:00,630
Oh, there you are.

149
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,570
I will solo ult you if I have to.

150
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:03,730
Oh, I don't.

151
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:04,810
Isn't that great?

152
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:06,610
I didn't have to.

153
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,630
Oh, oh, okay, there you go.

154
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:10,630
Yay!

155
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,230
Alright.

156
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:13,710
Wait, what the fuck?

157
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,810
Oh, it's fine.

158
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:20,270
It's fine.

159
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,110
Yeah, look at that.

160
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,130
See, it's fine.

161
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:22,990
Are you gonna ult?

162
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:23,390
No?

163
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:23,870
No?

164
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:24,330
Okay.

165
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:26,070
I know you have ult.

166
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:27,290
There's no way you don't.

167
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,470
We're almost at 90.

168
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:31,250
You passively gain ult at that time.

169
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:32,950
Hello.

170
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,890
You know, it could be worse.

171
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,730
I could be playing Hella in quick play.

172
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,750
What the fuck?

173
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:44,730
Bro, it's what- Bro, the round's not over yet.

174
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,750
You keep your ult for next round, buddy.

175
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:48,150
Oh.

176
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,530
See, this is why Psylocke counters Jeff.

177
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:56,610
Stop bullying the bronze, please.

178
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:01,870
Clea!

179
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:05,230
Clea and Spooky, thank you for the raid!

180
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:06,310
Thank you, thank you!

181
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,830
I hope you have a good stream, Clea.

182
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,150
Hello, hello, everybody!

183
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:13,190
For those who don't know, my name is DokiBird...

184
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:14,550
and I usually stream on YouTube!

185
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:17,150
And Clea used to be my mama!

186
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:18,370
Yeah!

187
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,950
She drew- she did my...

188
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:22,030
this skin suit.

189
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:22,870
That was her!

190
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,910
But hello, everybody!

191
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:26,890
Alright, I could go Hella.

192
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,350
You know what?

193
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,730
I wanted to have an even worse time playing.

194
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:32,650
And before I miss every shot, but like...

195
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:33,530
it's the thought that counts.

196
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,610
I need to check my- oh my god, wait.

197
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:39,270
I need to check the battery on my mouse after this.

198
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:45,930
I need to- I need to check the battery on my mouse after this.

199
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,350
It'd be awkward.

200
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:57,910
It'd be awkward if my- if like my- if my mouse dies in the middle of a raid game.

201
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,030
My mouse dies in these games, I don't care.

202
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:02,850
I don't like playing on Khorne.

203
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:04,650
Khorne is so fucking- I don't know.

204
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,810
It's just- it's so...

205
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:07,930
It's in the way.

206
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,550
Where'd they go?

207
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,890
Oh no, not Captain America.

208
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,990
Okay, I am missing shots though.

209
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:22,890

273
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:04,390
With my nose, I didn't realize like how little air has gone through my nose.

274
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:07,250
I don't know if it's working though I actually don't know.

275
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,050
I don't know.

276
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:13,150
I feel like I'm breathing more like that's a plus, right?

277
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,470
But actually, I don't know.

278
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,130
I don't know if it's working.

279
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:24,190
I Wake up and my mouth is closed when I wake up home.

280
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:25,070
Whoa, okay

282
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:50,470
It actually expands itself outside

283
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:58,210
But like, like, more airy.

284
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:02,190
Expand-o-hole.

285
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:13,770
Also like, now since I'm on alt account, I like have, I feel more comfortable playing other characters instead of, uh, do not say that!

286
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:29,550
But, um, um, but now I feel more comfortable playing, like I don't feel like, well, I might be throwing, but like I don't feel like I'm not throwing my own elope because it's not my main.

287
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:35,990

288
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:37,390

00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:50,210
It might not be my best character, but like, I'm trying!

293
00:19:52,610 --> 00:20:02,950
You know, like, I always learn other supports in, in eternity lobbies, which is a bad, which is a bad idea, but I always do that.

294
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:06,070
I always like, whenever like a new character is met up...

295
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:08,630
What?

296
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:11,890

299
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:34,650

300
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,030

00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:53,410
Okay, it's like up here, and they do that, and then they do this, and then, um, right?

303
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:57,330
Or like, they do one here.

304
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:58,810

Okay, okay.

307
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:12,970
I'm trying to figure out, I've seen, like, other Loki players play like this, but I don't know if this is right.

308
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:14,370
I don't know.

309
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:15,810

310
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,550

00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:56,010
I swear to God, I'm just not gonna, I'm just won't be, like, doing any damage, and that's okay.

324
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,050
I'll be, like, here, maybe?

325
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,890

00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:05,410
Don't worry.

328
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:08,830
They'll think I'm just a clone.

329
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:10,830
Oh, shit.

330
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,110

No, we cannot.

351
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:57,370
That's actually so unlucky.

352
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:00,170
I was just about...

353
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:02,430
I was just about to...

354
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:05,170
Oh, my God.

355
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:06,770
That's so unlucky.

356
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:10,570
Just about to do that copy too.

357
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:13,630
I'm not fucking peeking that shit.

358
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:16,390
There's, like, four people doing that.

359
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:17,230
You're so brave.

360
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:20,790
Someone should give you a medal for fucking looking into that.

361
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:22,870
Oh!

362
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,650
Okay, did my Luna die again?

363
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:27,030
Okay!

364
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:28,490
Goddamn!

365
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:30,090
Every time!

366
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,070
Please, I need a re...

367
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:36,170
Every time I want...

368
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:36,770
Please.

369
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:38,230
Please!

370
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:38,970
Oh, my God!

371
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:39,850
Hawkeye, you took it!

372
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:43,630
Bro, I was fucking shooting the Hawkeye!

373
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,410
It's Froggen.

374
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,190
God, chill.

375
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,770
I was shooting the Hawkeye!

376
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:52,790
The Hawkeye literally took...

377
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:55,170
The Hawkeye literally took it!

378
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:58,110
Okay.

379
00:23:59,190 --> 00:23:59,750
There we go.

380
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,970
You see, this is why...

381
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:04,850
Guys, I'm just gonna say first game.

382
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,570
First game, guys.

383
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:09,890
First game here of the day.

384
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:11,590
First game at 11.

385
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:13,830
What the fuck?

386
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:14,570
Oh, shit!

387
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:16,750
Oh, my God, I'm alive.

388
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,050
I'm fucking alive.

389
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:23,910
Okay, I don't know about that, but that's alright.

390
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:25,570
That's okay.

391
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:28,610
What the fuck are you...

392
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:29,750
Why?

393
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:32,070
Why did you come back to me?

394
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,610
Oh, my God!

395
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:38,610
Bro, look at your team!

396
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:41,790
Okay, I don't know about...

397
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:42,750
I don't know what we should have.

398
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:45,730
See, this is why I need to play low-key.

399
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:47,450
I need to get better at this fucking character.

400
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:49,430
I don't know what I'm doing.

401
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:55,190
Alright, if anything bad happens to him, I can...

402
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:56,530
Guys, he killed two!

403
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:57,250
You heard that?

404
00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:00,230
How is my other clone still okay down there?

405
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:03,930
Okay, that's fine.

406
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:05,410
Wait, I missed it, too.

407
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,210
That's crazy.

408
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,170
That worked?

409
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:13,870
Not gonna lie, I did not expect that to work.

410
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:18,530
Oh, shit!

411
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:19,470
Don't!

412
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:24,850
No, I do aim the ground.

413
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:29,370
I do aim the ground, but our Hawkeye was also stood...

414
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:33,590
Our Hawkeye also stood in front of the shots I was supposed to hit her mag.

415
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:35,670
So that was unfortunate.

416
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:38,610
I don't know if I can touch this.

417
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,130
I mean, I could try.

418
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:43,250
I'm slowly walking forward.

419
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:47,590
Okay, there...

420
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:51,730
Oh my god.

421
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:53,870
I had to touch it!

422
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,930
Okay, our Luna just has to live.

423
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,310
And then I can...

424
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:58,550
Okay.

425
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:00,070
Nevermind.

426
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:02,950
Goodbye.

427
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,250
I guess I...

428
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,230
Go this way.

429
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:13,290
Brother, it wouldn't let me change.

430
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:14,410
Okay, that's cool.

431
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:14,530
Oh, no.

432
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:16,870
Oh, goodbye, Neymor.

433
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:17,870
Goodbye.

434
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:18,890
Goodbye.

435
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,890
It's okay, I'm learning, Loki.

436
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:23,550
No,

437
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,570
I absolutely try to aim the ground.

438
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:29,890
I know I can't aim fucking...

439
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,630
Loki's projectile is so weird sometimes.

440
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:34,710
So it's like...

441
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:36,610
Oh, please.

442
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,570
I'm aiming the ground.

443
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,210
Oh my god.

444
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:46,510
Okay.

445
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:48,750
Oh!

446
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:50,410
Live!

447
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:53,430
Live, please!

448
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:54,790
Okay, nice.

449
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:56,170
Nice, they all live.

450
00:26:57,970 --> 00:26:58,530
Alright.

451
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:00,210
Everybody lives.

452
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,970
I had to do that preemptively.

453
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:05,150
I did not trust...

454
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:05,850
I did not...

455
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:06,170
Oh!

456
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:09,470
What the fuck?

457
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:11,850
What the fuck?

458
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:12,990
It's fine.

459
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:13,630
It's fine.

460
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,870
Okay, well...

461
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:16,950
Can you kill me, please?

462
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,250
Can they kill me?

463
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:23,890
How is he the only one that ulted in that entire fight?

464
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:26,430
How do we have five ults?

465
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:28,330
Holy shit, okay.

466
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:29,790
Alright.

467
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,150
From downtown.

468
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:33,790
Hello, Celestial Lobby.

469
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:36,210
Celestial Lobby is so interesting.

470
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:38,750
Even though I'm not Celestial.

471
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:40,250
On this account.

472
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:42,890
To be fair, I'm like low Eternity.

473
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,210
So like, it makes sense.

474
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:48,330
Get on my...

475
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:49,050
Oh, that's fine.

476
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:57,430
Don't worry, I'm shooting the ground.

477
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,770
Don't worry, I'm doing it.

478
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:04,310
Oh shit!

479
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:05,150
You lost?

480
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,450
You lost the fight?

481
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:09,530
That's awkward.

482
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,890
I hope they kill him.

483
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:17,650
I hope they kill him.

484
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:18,230
Thank God.

485
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:21,350
I was not expecting him to lose that fight.

486
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:24,370
I'm set up above.

487
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:26,330
Okay.

488
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,690
I'll be back here, guys.

489
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:30,590
They don't know.

490
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:32,430
They don't know.

491
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,290
How would they know?

492
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:35,330
You cancel her ult.

493
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:38,010
Oh my god, I have to reload.

494
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:43,490
Jesus Christ!

495
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:44,330
Oh my god!

496
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:45,330
Oh my god!

497
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:46,930
We're all alive.

498
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:55,170
30 invents too!

499
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:58,270
No!

500
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:00,150
I'm coming back.

501
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,410
I'm coming back.

502
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:01,870
No!

503
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:02,450
My copy!

504
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:04,510
Who did I copy?

505
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:06,090
My copy!

506
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:07,190
Okay.

507
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:10,050
Alright.

508
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:14,990
Oh my god!

509
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:15,910
This is the only thing I can do.

510
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,890
Oh my god.

511
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:18,590
Okay.

512
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:19,570
Okay.

513
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:20,650
Okay.

514
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,210
Oh my god!

515
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:23,630
Thank god!

516
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:23,850
Okay.

517
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:25,610
Please!

518
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:26,150
Please!

519
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:27,770
Please!

520
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:32,730
There we go.

521
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:33,630
Okay.

522
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:38,730
I'm trying to figure this out as much as I can.

523
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:41,490
Okay.

524
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:43,950
And then...

525
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:44,750
Here I go!

526
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:50,090
Oh my god!

527
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:51,030
It's okay!

528
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,330
I'm like fighting for my life.

529
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:59,710
I'm like doing ring around the rosie right now.

530
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,050
It's alright.

531
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:06,450
There's no way my team can fuck that up now.

532
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:09,050
There's no way.

533
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:11,430
The Looney Tunes.

534
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:13,250
Wait.

535
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:17,230
Yeah, I was like there's no way they can fuck this up.

536
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:18,770
I traveled around the world.

537
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:27,310
Oh my god.

538
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:32,770
I just like ran around the fucking point.

539
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:38,070
Oh, first game of the day.

540
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:39,130
I'm not okay.

541
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:41,850
I'm definitely not warmed up.

542
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:43,070
Who would've thought?

543
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:46,970
Playing Psylocke does not translate well to Loki projectile.

544
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:53,410
Who would've thought?

545
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:55,490
It feels so different.

546
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:58,710
Chorus, thank you for the tier 1 sub!

547
00:30:58,810 --> 00:30:59,110
Thank you!

548
00:30:59,510 --> 00:30:59,990
Thank you!

549
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:03,070
Lord, thank you for the tier 1 sub!

550
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:03,610
I really appreciate it.

551
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:03,930
Thank you!

552
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,970
Nekka, thank you for the raid!

553
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:07,030
I really appreciate it!

554
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:07,530
Hello, everybody!

555
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:08,250
Hello, hello!

556
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:10,090
I'm like...

557
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:10,410
Oh yeah.

558
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,470
I'm like...

559
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,230
Oh my gosh.

560
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:14,410
I'm like learning Loki in Eternity lobbies.

561
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:15,790
The worst...

562
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,570
The worst...

563
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:17,510
You know, to learn...

564
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:17,670
Hey!

565
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,470
At least I'm not doing it in one of the lobbies.

566
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:23,250
I'm doing it in Eternity lobbies.

567
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:29,010
MrBrokenBond, thank you for the 5 gifted subs!

568
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:29,450
Thank you!

569
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:30,310
Thank you!

570
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:32,570
I really appreciate it.

571
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:34,670
Brandon, thank you for the gifted sub!

572
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:35,470
Thank you!

573
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:36,970
Alright.

574
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:39,090
I heard that.

575
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:42,450
I know that Loki is one of the best supports right now.

576
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:45,350
Loki and Adam are one of the best supports.

577
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:48,250
And I need to learn it anyway.

578
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:50,930
Because I can't...

579
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:52,410
Guys, guys.

580
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:53,990
You guys know there's like...

581
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:57,090
Squids right behind us.

582
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:57,890
But that's okay.

583
00:31:58,410 --> 00:31:59,030
We don't...

584
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:02,310
I know you guys do not care at all.

585
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:08,690
That's crazy.

586
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:12,590
They all just like walked past them.

587
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:15,590
It's so funny.

588
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:18,310
Sorry.

589
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:24,750
It's fine.

590
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:25,890
I forced him down.

591
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:29,270
I was like, fight down in the low ground with us.

592
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,650
I'm not letting you get high ground.

593
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:35,470
I may or may not have griefed our name.

594
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:36,390
Where am I doing that?

595
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:38,670
Look, I need the heal charge, guys.

596
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:42,870
I need the heal charge more than him on high ground.

597
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:45,910
Okay.

598
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:50,830
Alright, there you go.

599
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:53,810
Get down here and fight with us.

600
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:55,450
In the low ground.

601
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:01,650
You think you're better than us just because you're on the high ground?

602
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:02,890
Hit me.

603
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:03,270
Hit me.

604
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:03,750
Hit me.

605
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:04,170
Where?

606
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:04,430
Where?

607
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:05,870
Where?

608
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:07,550
Who said that?

609
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:08,550
Who said that?

610
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:13,930
Oh shit.

611
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:14,310
Okay.

612
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:17,490
Wait.

613
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:20,330
Kill him.

614
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:21,450
Nice.

615
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:21,750
Okay.

616
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,570
I was like, who the fuck?

617
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:26,870
Do you think he's gonna... okay, nice.

618
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,050
There you go.

619
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:28,570
I just...

620
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:30,770
There you go.

621
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:32,530
They'll be fine, right?

622
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:33,670
Yeah, they'll be fine.

623
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:35,350
They'll be so healthy.

624
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,110
I believe.

625
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:40,770
What the fuck?

626
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:41,970
Oh shit!

627
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:43,890
Oh shit!

628
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:46,730
I was like, they got that?

629
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:48,990
They lost their max one.

630
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:50,230
It's okay.

631
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:52,030
Don't worry, I'm a hero.

632
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,630
I'm a hero, guys.

633
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:56,290
Don't worry.

634
00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:00,570
That one Wolverine will not hurt you now.

635
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:03,710
God, guys, don't.

636
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:03,970
Don't.

637
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:04,090
Don't.

638
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:04,330
Don't.

639
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:05,870
I'm healing the tanks, okay?

640
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:06,090
I'm healing the tanks, okay?

641
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:07,850
I'm trying to heal the tanks, okay, guys?

642
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:08,650
I'm...

643
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:13,190
I'm not missing the Hawkeye.

644
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:16,790
Guys, I think my depth perception is a little wonky right now.

645
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:17,490
It's cause I...

646
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:19,710
Guys, I think it's cause maybe I'm just tired.

647
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,390
Maybe I'm just tired.

648
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:25,250
That's why my depth perception isn't working so well right now.

649
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:29,370
Alright, did they push up?

650
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:29,990
I don't know.

651
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:32,990
Wait, they're not pushing up?

652
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:34,730
I'm surprised.

653
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:37,790
I thought they would push up.

654
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:39,030
Wait.

655
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:39,930
Alright.

656
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:41,250
Keep going.

657
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:41,910
Keep going.

658
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:42,690
Let's go.

659
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:43,710
Woo!

660
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:46,370
I copied that a while ago.

661
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:47,170
Woo!

662
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:51,510
Let's go.

663
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:54,590
Look, I didn't think we would win that.

664
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:56,470
I didn't.

665
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:59,710
I definitely did not believe.

666
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:02,090
I am...

667
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:04,710
I definitely did not believe in my team.

668
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:06,690
By the way.

669
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:07,770
Can you guys tell?

670
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:17,810
Can you guys tell that I have a huge lack of trust on them?

671
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:19,330
Are they okay?

672
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:20,350
I can't tell.

673
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:24,450
They're fine, right?

674
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:27,270
Okay.

675
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:28,630
That's fine.

676
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:31,310
That's fine.

677
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:33,330
Just frontline as much as you can.

678
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:34,410
Alright.

679
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:36,930
Don't worry!

680
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:38,290
I have this!

681
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:39,730
Stand in it!

682
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:41,190
Oh, that's fucking right!

683
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:43,370
The invuln!

684
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:45,110
Okay.

685
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:46,350
They won't know I'm right here.

686
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:47,190
Okay.

687
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:48,010
I...

688
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:50,430
I can't... I don't know where they are.

689
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,470
I don't know where they are.

690
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:54,110
Oh my god.

691
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:57,470
I'm sorry!

692
00:35:59,090 --> 00:35:59,610
Yippee!

693
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:03,490
Thank you!

694
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:04,450
Yeah!

695
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:07,290
We got them to Eternity!

696
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:09,250
My eyes were so tired.

697
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:10,710
My eyes!

698
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:13,810
Oh my god.

699
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:15,450
We did it!

700
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:20,770
So easy, guys.

701
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:21,130
See?

702
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:25,350
Learning a new... Learning a character in Eternity is not that bad, guys.

703
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:26,230
It's...

704
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:29,450
It's not griefing if you win.

705
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:32,010
That's my number one rule.

706
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:34,110
It's not griefing if I win, guys.

707
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:35,110
I don't know.

708
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:37,390
I... I think I wanna... I'm gonna avoid their Moonlight.

709
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:40,730
Their Moonlight was... was definitely a person.

710
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:41,950
Uh...

711
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:45,870
Best...

712
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,270
Bro, I...

713
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,910
I don't think that's the right word there.

714
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,450
Best... Oh, man.

715
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:55,090
I have no idea what the fuck I was doing on Loki.

716
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:57,880
I have people that are like, oh...

717
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,350
Loki's pretty decent.

718
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:01,710
And I was like, do you have eyes?

719
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:02,670
I...

720
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:07,210
Here's my secret.

721
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:10,810
I don't know what I'm doing on Loki 99% of the time.

722
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:15,830
As literally as something runs at me, I just put like two clones in front of me.

723
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:20,130
And I'm like, can't kill me if there's three of me.

724
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,420
That's like, my game plan.

725
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:32,600
Someone runs at me, I'm just like, who... which one is the real me?

726
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,080
Yeah, which one is me?

727
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:47,010
I know, like, what my biggest flaw, though, playing Loki is that I don't know how to use my snaps correctly.

728
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:49,830
And, uh, I don't know, uh...

729
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:57,230
I don't know how to, like, use my snaps correctly in a more productive way.

730
00:37:57,530 --> 00:38:00,470
And also, my clone placements are really bad.

731
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:05,450
I do watch, I do watch other, like, pro support players, though, to, like, learn.

732
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:09,330
How I learn is just I watch other players sometimes.

733
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:12,610
Which is how I learn how to play Apex and Overwatch.

734
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:16,710
I just watch how other players do it, and then I just, like, absorb them.

735
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:19,230
I'm like...

736
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,290
Oh, let's ban...

737
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:22,570
Oh, I was gonna ban Gru.

738
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:24,370
I'm banning Adam, okay.

739
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:26,110
I was gonna ban Hela.

740
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:30,790
Oh, it's just not fun to play against.

741
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:32,470
Hmm.

742
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:37,490
Yeah, so, like, I'm really bad with...

743
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:39,030
I'm really bad with...

744
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:40,830
Like...

745
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:42,530
I don't...

746
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:45,890
I wanna say I'm bad at clone management because I don't manage my...

747
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:48,350
I don't, like, look at my clone cooldown.

748
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:52,570
I just be like, one clone is down, I put all clones down now.

749
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:56,890
And then when we move forward, I was like, no clones here, all clones here.

750
00:38:57,290 --> 00:38:59,830
And then when they destroy my clones, I have zero clone placement.

751
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:01,930
I'm just like, well, okay, fuck me, I guess.

752
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:02,350
I...

753
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:05,750
No clones, I guess.

754
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,890
We all die now.

755
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,430
Oh, William, thank you for tier one sub.

756
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:12,530
Thank you, thank you.

757
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:15,630
Name her Bucky Ven...

758
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:16,990
Oh, we didn't ban Hela?

759
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:17,510
Okay.

760
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:22,210
I mean, why would we ban Venom when we have a Spider-Man player?

761
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:23,550
Like...

762
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:25,870
That doesn't make sense.

763
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:28,430
How the fuck would we get rid of him?

764
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:30,510
Let's practice more Loki, or Lokiburn.

765
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:32,090
Sorry, Lokitty.

766
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:34,030
Lokitty.

767
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,450
We have a Spider-Man player.

768
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:41,090
Why the fuck do we, like, nerf him?

769
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,530
Why the fuck do we break his kneecaps?

770
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:46,750
Like, he's already a Spider-Man player.

771
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:49,350
He's already nerfed as hell.

772
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:51,330
Almost went gamer there.

773
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:04,970
Uh, BB, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

774
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:05,870
Thank you, thank you.

775
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:06,850
I said almost!

776
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:10,730
Alright, that's not a good big dog.

777
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:12,930
They have a Hela.

778
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:15,970
Man, if only we ban Hela.

779
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:17,730
Hela's half HP.

780
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:19,250
Do we even have a Hela player?

781
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:22,470
I'm scared.

782
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:24,910
I'm scared.

783
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:26,910
It's okay.

784
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:28,030
We have a Moon Knight?

785
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:30,510
I swear, I never see Moon Knight in higher elo anymore.

786
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:33,150
Hela's 1 HP top right?

787
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:36,390
It's, like, so interesting to see Hela players here.

788
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:37,830
Oh no.

789
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:39,710
Oh no.

790
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:40,890
No, Groot!

791
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:41,690
Get in here!

792
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:44,910
Please, I sacrificed my clothes for that!

793
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,810
Oh, how's your...

794
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:52,750
We just let her survive out there?

795
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:55,590
Let's beat up that bird.

796
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:57,710
Yeah, beat up the fuck...

797
00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:00,490
Wait, why would the Spider-Man player not ban Hela?

798
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:07,510
We literally said fuck our Spider-Man one trick.

799
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:10,090
Let's not give him anything in this world.

800
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:16,270
We let them have Hela and get rid of fucking Venom.

801
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:18,770
We do not like this guy, apparently.

802
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:23,230
He wants a challenge.

803
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:26,590
Yeah, it definitely is a challenge.

804
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:31,230
Okay, if they... I hear the Hela to my left.

805
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:33,590
Oh my god.

806
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:35,350
I hope they kill my...

807
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:36,450
Oh wait, okay.

808
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:37,130
He's dead.

809
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:37,390
Okay.

810
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:40,510
I was gonna say, I would be okay if they kill my Sue.

811
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:42,970
Because then I get to live.

812
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:46,490
Oh, that's not where I want to put the clone.

813
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:50,210
Alright.

814
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:52,710
See, I don't have my clones.

815
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:53,990
I don't clone management.

816
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:58,210
I literally just place clones until I have no more clones.

817
00:41:59,310 --> 00:41:59,890
Break wall, break wall.

818
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:03,510
It's okay.

819
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:04,070
I'm okay.

820
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:07,250
I just walked around until she stopped shooting me.

821
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:09,810
Oh no.

822
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:11,390
That's fine.

823
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:13,390
That's fine.

824
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:15,650
We have... oh okay.

825
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:18,010
It's not fine.

826
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:22,610
Oh wait, they used Mantis ult.

827
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:23,170
That's good.

828
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:24,810
Oh shit.

829
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:26,690
Oh, that's fucked up.

830
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:29,070
Lil, does he know?

831
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:31,390
I am not Loki.

832
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:33,150
Guys, Hela's just sitting here.

833
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:34,410
Menacing these.

834
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:35,170
Bro!

835
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:40,030
I'm just letting him... I'm just letting him sit there.

836
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:41,790
Please someone shoot him.

837
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:46,090
I'm walking forward.

838
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:49,330
Oh, and he still tries to kill me.

839
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:54,450
What is wrong with you?

840
00:42:56,350 --> 00:43:00,390
Why did we just let him do that?

841
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:04,830
That's fucked up.

842
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:06,030
That's actually fucked up.

843
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:11,370
We just let him literally just stay in the back for 20 years.

844
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:13,470
That's actually crazy.

845
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:16,630
Okay, just...

846
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:17,330
Hey guys.

847
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:19,110
Hey guys.

848
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:23,150
We're like a little family.

849
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,970
That no-rag, that fucking...

850
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:33,090
Okay, our strange is a little too excited.

851
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:36,250
Okay.

852
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:39,430
I wish I...

853
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,430
Yeah, I can put another clone up here.

854
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:43,490
Don't worry.

855
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:45,490
It should hit you, right?

856
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:50,410
I'm contesting top, right?

857
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:53,310
Don't worry, I got you Groot.

858
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:54,410
You're so healthy.

859
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:58,210
My low-key clone is just shooting you.

860
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:02,030
Oh shit, don't worry, I got you.

861
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:03,970
Oh.

862
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:05,630
Who got them?

863
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:07,230
It's okay.

864
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:08,770
Groot, please.

865
00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:12,290
Oh my god!

866
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:15,270
I haven't seen that combo in so long.

867
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:18,610
Where is the Hella?

868
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:22,210
Where did the Hella go?

869
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:23,330
Did we kill her?

870
00:44:24,310 --> 00:44:25,270
I don't know.

871
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:26,970
I'm so confused and scared.

872
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:29,430
She could be anywhere.

873
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:30,830
She could be here right now.

874
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:33,310
They actually did the combo.

875
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:33,970
It's crazy.

876
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:36,410
They're running...

877
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:37,870
Oh, they're still running triple support.

878
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:40,550
I don't know if it's working though.

879
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:41,450
For them.

880
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:45,170
Okay, maybe it is.

881
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:48,550
Okay, don't worry Groot, I got you.

882
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:50,290
Don't worry Groot!

883
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:52,570
Alright, someone break this so I can...

884
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:54,610
Oh fuck, am I the only one pushing cart?

885
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:55,090
I am.

886
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:56,510
Wait, hey, it's working!

887
00:44:57,310 --> 00:44:58,350
I'm just more of a support.

888
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:02,110
Oh, I thought I heard somebody.

889
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:03,410
I'm getting a little paranoid.

890
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:08,190
He has to do it now.

891
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:11,010
Yeah, I was gonna say, there's no way he's gonna...

892
00:45:11,830 --> 00:45:12,850
He has to do that now.

893
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:17,130
Alright, don't worry.

894
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:18,010
We're still healthy.

895
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:20,190
Wait a minute, there's three of us.

896
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:24,050
We're still so healthy.

897
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:24,490
Oh!

898
00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:28,690
We're still...

899
00:45:37,330 --> 00:45:39,230
We're not healthy anymore.

900
00:45:39,350 --> 00:45:39,810
It's okay!

901
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:43,770
I didn't use anything because they used everything.

902
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,510
Guys, that was the strat.

903
00:45:47,350 --> 00:45:50,090
I didn't use anything so they used everything.

904
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:54,210
It's not because I got overwhelmed.

905
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:57,990
See, look at that.

906
00:45:58,090 --> 00:45:59,450
That's called restraint, guys.

907
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:03,390
You gotta be able to restrain yourself.

908
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:07,330
It's always hella.

909
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:10,310
It's always hella up top.

910
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:14,990
It's fine.

911
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:17,310
I believe in us.

912
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:17,610
Look.

913
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:20,670
Don't worry, I got you.

914
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:22,530
Oh,

915
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:25,730
nice.

916
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:26,910
Nice.

917
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:28,190
Look at that.

918
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:32,390
Look at that fucking prediction right there, guys.

919
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:34,350
Holy shit.

920
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:36,290
Jesus Christ.

921
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:37,610
Oh my god.

922
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:41,610
Look at that prediction I had there.

923
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:44,130
That was a crazy good prediction, though.

924
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:44,650
You gotta admit.

925
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:48,030
Don't worry, I got you.

926
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:49,970
Oh, I have to reload.

927
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:51,010
I have to reload.

928
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:51,610
Please.

929
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:54,010
Please, I have to reload.

930
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:56,010
Please live.

931
00:46:57,490 --> 00:46:58,550
Oh my god.

932
00:46:58,650 --> 00:46:59,010
Oh!

933
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:03,330
I keep having to reload.

934
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:05,930
Okay, nice.

935
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:07,390
We're gaming.

936
00:47:08,050 --> 00:47:08,990
I was not panicking.

937
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:12,310
No, no, no, no.

938
00:47:12,350 --> 00:47:13,110
I had to reload.

939
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:22,610
I was just stuck on like a 30 second reload, chat.

940
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:27,010
Thank you for the Twitch Prime.

941
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:28,190
Thank you.

942
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:31,510
Yeah, the pain of every support.

943
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:32,230
The reload.

944
00:47:35,630 --> 00:47:36,910
Guys, I needed that.

945
00:47:37,070 --> 00:47:37,750
Exactly.

946
00:47:38,270 --> 00:47:38,870
Exactly.

947
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:41,110
Of course.

948
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:42,050
It's just like Apex.

949
00:47:42,050 --> 00:47:44,070
You have to reload after like one shot.

950
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:48,650
Banana, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

951
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:49,590
Thank you, thank you.

952
00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:54,590
You guys should free wins.

953
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:55,790
They probably...

954
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:56,670
Wait, who was the...

955
00:47:56,670 --> 00:47:57,830
Who was the cleric and dagger?

956
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:01,250
Yeah, I'll farm them.

957
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:03,990
That's sad.

958
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:05,350
Being farmed on one...

959
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:06,310
No, my worst...

960
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:09,690
I'm praying that Jeff never becomes meta because I don't...

961
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:11,930
I feel like Jeff is just too much pressure.

962
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:14,230
Because you're supposed to be a...

963
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:17,270
Playing Jeff is like playing King Jeff and like...

964
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:18,730
That's way too much pressure for me.

965
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:21,970
I won't be in the backlines, thank you.

966
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:29,870
Just trying to be in the backlines.

967
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:34,690
I hope Jeff never becomes meta.

968
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:37,170
Just be like a specific niche pick.

969
00:48:37,930 --> 00:48:39,550
What if I just break this for him?

970
00:48:41,310 --> 00:48:42,110
I almost...

971
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:43,130
Oh, they have man...

972
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:44,170
Oh, they're running widow.

973
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:45,410
They have widow, man.

974
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:50,130
I was about to just break it.

975
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:56,450
Apparently what I learned was that if you're playing...

976
00:48:56,450 --> 00:48:58,010
If you have a Groot...

977
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:02,870
If you're playing...

978
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:09,750
If you're playing Groot, you have to play Loki.

979
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:12,210
Because Loki is just so strong.

980
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:15,390
It's just so strong for Groot, he is.

981
00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:24,570
I got really scared.

982
00:49:28,270 --> 00:49:30,670
Oh no, I have to reload when I was setting up my cannon.

983
00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:32,510
Oh, that's the worst part.

984
00:49:34,310 --> 00:49:35,270
Please, where are you?

985
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:37,310
Oh my god, you're alive!

986
00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:39,030
Cloak is half HP.

987
00:49:39,230 --> 00:49:39,790
Cloak no fade.

988
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:40,390
Cloak no fade.

989
00:49:41,070 --> 00:49:41,370
Nice.

990
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:42,310
I did it.

991
00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:45,850
Oh shit.

992
00:49:47,950 --> 00:49:48,650
It's fine.

993
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:50,610
Our guy is almost close to his ult anyway.

994
00:49:50,910 --> 00:49:51,710
I hope that Cloak does.

995
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:52,490
Oh no.

996
00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:54,850
Wait, this is so easy.

997
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:58,490
Wait, when did Rengar...

998
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:05,810
Who are you trying to hit?

999
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:07,070
Widow?

1000
00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:08,930
Widow is dead already.

1001
00:50:08,930 --> 00:50:09,890
Who are you?

1002
00:50:10,070 --> 00:50:10,810
No, he is not.

1003
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:13,210
It's okay.

1004
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:14,830
The Widow didn't know where I was.

1005
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:18,850
I mean, they have to change team ups.

1006
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:21,050
If they don't, the game is going to be so fucking boring.

1007
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:23,030
I'm already bored with the current team ups.

1008
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:24,890
I want more experimentation.

1009
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:28,710
Because then it's just going to be the same thing over and over again.

1010
00:50:28,890 --> 00:50:31,630
Which is basically how Apex sort of died.

1011
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:32,230
Okay.

1012
00:50:36,690 --> 00:50:38,670
I'm a hero.

1013
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:40,250
Don't mind Invisible.

1014
00:50:40,350 --> 00:50:41,550
What she did was...

1015
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:42,510
She didn't do jack shit.

1016
00:50:45,370 --> 00:50:46,650
I'm a hero.

1017
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:48,270
I saved myself.

1018
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:53,150
Don't worry.

1019
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:55,030
I'm a hero.

1020
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:56,890
I lived.

1021
00:50:57,450 --> 00:50:58,770
What a hero.

1022
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:00,650
I know.

1023
00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:01,530
Don't worry.

1024
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:05,190
Do you think he...

1025
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:06,530
Do you think I saved him?

1026
00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:07,570
Oh my god.

1027
00:51:07,570 --> 00:51:08,490
I'm actually...

1028
00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:09,830
Oh my god.

1029
00:51:09,930 --> 00:51:11,470
Bro, there's no way the Spider-Man...

1030
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:13,170
There's no way.

1031
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:14,370
Oh my god.

1032
00:51:14,370 --> 00:51:16,410
The way the Spider-Man lives.

1033
00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:18,010
Holy shit.

1034
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:22,130
I was not expecting our Spider-Man to live there.

1035
00:51:23,470 --> 00:51:25,830
That actually felt like...

1036
00:51:25,830 --> 00:51:27,230
An impossible feat.

1037
00:51:29,010 --> 00:51:30,110
I have ult again, Guru.

1038
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:31,610
Oh, Jesus.

1039
00:51:32,470 --> 00:51:33,090
Oh!

1040
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:34,610
What?

1041
00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:38,790
Oh my god.

1042
00:51:39,150 --> 00:51:39,670
Okay.

1043
00:51:40,090 --> 00:51:40,570
Don't worry.

1044
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:41,530
I'm still a hero.

1045
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:44,670
Don't worry.

1046
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:46,470
I'm alive.

1047
00:51:48,270 --> 00:51:49,690
Don't worry.

1048
00:51:51,010 --> 00:51:52,490
I'm a hero.

1049
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:57,330
We did it.

1050
00:51:59,290 --> 00:52:01,130
I saved myself.

1051
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:03,270
I am my own hero.

1052
00:52:05,010 --> 00:52:07,190
Why did he get you?

1053
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:08,210
I don't know.

1054
00:52:08,310 --> 00:52:08,910
He just...

1055
00:52:08,910 --> 00:52:10,450
Maybe he just hates...

1056
00:52:10,770 --> 00:52:11,730
He just hates Sue.

1057
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:14,110
Why?

1058
00:52:14,730 --> 00:52:16,090
Why do you keep...

1059
00:52:16,090 --> 00:52:17,130
Oh, he missed?

1060
00:52:17,850 --> 00:52:18,830
How did he...

1061
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:19,990
I mean...

1062
00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:20,670
Yeah.

1063
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:24,830
I had the same thought, too.

1064
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:26,090
I was like, how did he...

1065
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:28,330
How did he miss?

1066
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,110
Get in here.

1067
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:33,930
Oh, it's fine.

1068
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:35,030
It should be fine, right?

1069
00:52:35,530 --> 00:52:36,330
I believe.

1070
00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:37,830
It should be fine.

1071
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:40,690
Yeah.

1072
00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:41,310
We're fine.

1073
00:52:41,470 --> 00:52:41,710
See?

1074
00:52:43,350 --> 00:52:44,510
Are you on lowkey right now?

1075
00:52:44,510 --> 00:52:45,130
I don't know.

1076
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:46,870
I don't know if I'm a good lowkey player.

1077
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:48,590
I didn't...

1078
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:50,650
You did.

1079
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:54,890
I'm good at saving myself.

1080
00:52:55,110 --> 00:52:56,390
But the Pope is a pixel person, right?

1081
00:52:57,850 --> 00:52:59,650
I'm good at saving myself.

1082
00:52:59,650 --> 00:53:02,190
I don't know about my other supports, though.

1083
00:53:02,410 --> 00:53:03,970
There goes my hero.

1084
00:53:06,690 --> 00:53:07,490
I'm winning!

1085
00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:08,630
You're right.

1086
00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:09,070
You're right.

1087
00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:10,290
I am winning, chat.

1088
00:53:10,990 --> 00:53:12,110
All in a day's work.

1089
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:14,150
Nice!

1090
00:53:14,830 --> 00:53:16,930
Alright, who is the...

1091
00:53:16,930 --> 00:53:19,830
Who the fuck is the cloak that...

1092
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:20,370
Is it pixels?

1093
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:21,390
I'm gonna check.

1094
00:53:23,530 --> 00:53:25,070
I'm gonna check if it is pixels.

1095
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:25,870
What is this?

1096
00:53:26,630 --> 00:53:28,110
Hey there, DonKingKong.

1097
00:53:28,210 --> 00:53:29,030
It's been four days.

1098
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:31,610
Wait, has it been four days since I...

1099
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:31,870
What?

1100
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:32,930
There's no way...

1101
00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:33,550
No, okay.

1102
00:53:33,950 --> 00:53:34,470
I thought...

1103
00:53:34,470 --> 00:53:35,350
I was like, there's no way.

1104
00:53:36,730 --> 00:53:37,950
There's no fucking way.

1105
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:38,230
Okay.

1106
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:39,510
History.

1107
00:53:40,310 --> 00:53:40,670
Alright.

1108
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:45,650
I know they ran triple support.

1109
00:53:45,790 --> 00:53:47,210
Is it O-I-I-D?

1110
00:53:48,170 --> 00:53:49,790
Or this one?

1111
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:51,250
Which one was it?

1112
00:53:51,370 --> 00:53:52,330
Who was the guy?

1113
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:55,010
He played a lot of characters.

1114
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:57,070
I don't know which one is it.

1115
00:53:57,190 --> 00:53:58,910
I'll just avoid...

1116
00:54:01,390 --> 00:54:02,510
Which one is it?

1117
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:04,850
They both played cloak.

1118
00:54:04,970 --> 00:54:06,850
I don't know which one was the worst cloak player.

1119
00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:09,530
I'll just avoid...

1120
00:54:09,530 --> 00:54:11,250
I could just avoid both just in case.

1121
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:13,430
No, they just said...

1122
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:17,390
They literally just said...

1123
00:54:18,350 --> 00:54:19,670
They were like...

1124
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:21,670
That cloak and dagger threw my game.

1125
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:24,050
Yeah, so I was like, which one?

1126
00:54:27,810 --> 00:54:28,490
Which one?

1127
00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:29,150
Oh, you're right.

1128
00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:30,830
No, I'll just avoid both.

1129
00:54:30,830 --> 00:54:33,250
They were both pretty bad, not gonna lie.

1130
00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:36,470
I mean, this guy has 9k damage on strange.

1131
00:54:38,130 --> 00:54:40,270
Or they just swapped strange players?

1132
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:41,770
They could've.

1133
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:42,670
Yay!

1134
00:54:48,970 --> 00:54:50,850
O-I-I-D was the worst one?

1135
00:54:50,990 --> 00:54:51,490
Oh, okay.

1136
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:54,250
I don't want to waste my voice slots then.

1137
00:54:56,190 --> 00:54:56,690
Okay.

1138
00:54:57,950 --> 00:54:58,910
You're unbanished.

1139
00:54:59,310 --> 00:55:00,650
Welcome back to society.

1140
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:04,830
You've been unbanished from the lands.

1141
00:55:05,890 --> 00:55:07,070
Alright, I'll be right back.

1142
00:55:07,110 --> 00:55:08,270
I'm gonna get tissues real quick.

1143
00:55:08,510 --> 00:55:09,730
I need to blow my nose.

1144
00:55:09,970 --> 00:55:10,750
I'll be right back.

1145
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:12,230
I ran out of tissues.

1146
00:55:40,430 --> 00:55:42,070
Alright, I'm back.

1147
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:44,490
I am...

1148
00:55:44,930 --> 00:55:45,690
7TB broken?

1149
00:55:45,850 --> 00:55:47,020
I don't think I've ever had 7TB.

1150
00:55:47,990 --> 00:55:52,770
I think when I left Twitch, the first time I left Twitch, 7TB was not a thing yet.

1151
00:55:53,490 --> 00:55:54,730
Or unless they fixed it?

1152
00:55:54,790 --> 00:55:55,290
I don't know.

1153
00:55:55,490 --> 00:55:55,950
I don't know.

1154
00:55:56,070 --> 00:55:56,770
Did I add it?

1155
00:55:57,010 --> 00:55:57,650
I don't remember.

1156
00:55:59,310 --> 00:56:00,570
I don't remember.

1157
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:06,800
I don't use it enough.

1158
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:08,080
I don't have it, right?

1159
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:09,520
Oh, I don't have it, yeah.

1160
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:12,900
No, I just don't have it because I'm too lazy to set it up myself.

1161
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,440
Unless a mod wants to set it up for me.

1162
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,520
I have too much other stuff to do.

1163
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,280
Alright, let me check my mouse.

1164
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:23,340
Okay, 39%.

1165
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:25,380
That should be enough for today's stream.

1166
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:27,600
39% should be enough.

1167
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:29,800
I should avoid...

1168
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,180
I was like thinking about drinking...

1169
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:33,420
Caffeine?

1170
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:35,660
But then I remember.

1171
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:37,480
I have a 12.30 stream today.

1172
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,740
Maybe it's not a good idea to drink caffeine.

1173
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:43,800
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

1174
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:45,860
I just need someone to do all the emote stuff.

1175
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:48,680
Because I can't be bothered.

1176
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:50,860
I have too much other work to do.

1177
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,140
Every day.

1178
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:54,480
The rise and grind.

1179
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:58,520
Clocking in and then never clocking out.

1180
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:02,080
Are they having a little fight?

1181
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:03,080
I'll kill the winner.

1182
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:04,600
Don't worry guys.

1183
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:06,980
What the fuck?

1184
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:09,320
I don't think he knows that...

1185
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:10,900
When I'm invisible?

1186
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:12,360
You fucking idiot.

1187
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:16,360
He did it.

1188
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,360
Come on, get over here.

1189
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:22,540
Oh shit, nevermind.

1190
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:23,620
I'll watch.

1191
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:26,100
Thanks.

1192
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:30,720
Don't worry, I'll kill that winner.

1193
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:34,920
Thanks.

1194
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:38,400
I don't think he knows that...

1195
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,800
Invis makes it so that you can't ult me.

1196
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:42,640
Which is pretty funny.

1197
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,180
That he didn't know that.

1198
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,360
You're a Psylocke player, you should know.

1199
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:48,500
You should know not to...

1200
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:51,460
Not to ult a Psylocke.

1201
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:58,780
Yeah, I'm not gonna be doing too long of a stream today.

1202
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:03,300
Not gonna go into the 5am queues.

1203
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:08,160
Yo Doki, I got to GM playing almost nothing but Penny.

1204
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:08,760
Is that rare?

1205
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,080
Yeah, it is.

1206
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:12,060
But also, GM is like...

1207
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:12,900
Sort of like...

1208
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:13,680
GM is Celestial.

1209
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:15,500
It's sort of like the Wild Wild West.

1210
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:16,900
Where like...

1211
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:18,700
People are so fucking inflated.

1212
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:20,620
In that ELO.

1213
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:21,760
So it's like...

1214
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,880
It's hard to actually be like...

1215
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:26,460
It's hard to tell if it's like...

1216
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:28,280
You got there...

1217
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:30,080
As Penny because your team...

1218
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:32,020
Might not be like...

1219
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:33,800
Really good.

1220
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,820
Like the enemy team just might not be really good.

1221
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:40,940
Yeah, you can get to GM...

1222
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:42,500
With a negative winrate.

1223
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:44,560
We can get to Celestial with a negative winrate.

1224
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:46,220
From what I've heard.

1225
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:47,860
Which is crazy.

1226
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:52,880
It's actually crazy you can get to Celestial with a negative winrate.

1227
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:56,720
It's funny because a lot of people were complaining about...

1228
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,500
Not having a rank reset.

1229
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:00,180
About having a rank reset.

1230
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:01,800
And not everyone was like...

1231
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:03,880
Why didn't you give us a rank reset?

1232
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:05,820
Look at what you did!

1233
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:08,320
Look at what you did!

1234
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:09,720
But it's like...

1235
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:12,160
I'm just like...

1236
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:12,840
But...

1237
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:14,880
Like...

1238
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:16,800
They were going to.

1239
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:18,540
They should have though.

1240
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:19,840
They 100% should have.

1241
00:59:26,510 --> 00:59:28,990
You have inhuman mental to DoomQ.

1242
00:59:29,090 --> 00:59:30,770
Negative winrate all the way to Celestial.

1243
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:32,990
Some people just never stop playing.

1244
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:34,670
Like...

1245
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:36,530
I know there's a person...

1246
00:59:36,530 --> 00:59:37,690
In high elo.

1247
00:59:38,430 --> 00:59:40,530
All they do is just...

1248
00:59:40,530 --> 00:59:41,950
They would...

1249
00:59:41,950 --> 00:59:44,050
I don't know how they can do that.

1250
00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:44,970
Like...

1251
00:59:44,970 --> 00:59:46,370
They would just play...

1252
00:59:46,370 --> 00:59:47,630
They are like 1 above all.

1253
00:59:48,270 --> 00:59:48,570
Slash...

1254
00:59:49,030 --> 00:59:49,630
Uh...

1255
00:59:49,630 --> 00:59:50,390
High Eternity.

1256
00:59:50,450 --> 00:59:52,330
Like just below 1 above all.

1257
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:53,930
And all they do...

1258
00:59:53,930 --> 00:59:54,970
They go from like...

1259
00:59:55,490 --> 01:00:00,130
400, 200, 400, 500, 100, 200, 400.

1260
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:00,590
Like...

1261
01:00:00,590 --> 01:00:02,110
I don't know how you can do that.

1262
01:00:02,190 --> 01:00:02,490
Like...

1263
01:00:03,370 --> 01:00:03,890
Like...

1264
01:00:03,890 --> 01:00:05,910
That would fuck up my mental.

1265
01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:06,850
Every day.

1266
01:00:07,430 --> 01:00:08,970
Just going through like...

1267
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:10,710
Like...

1268
01:00:10,710 --> 01:00:12,970
Either SR gains or SR loss.

1269
01:00:13,050 --> 01:00:14,330
Huge SR losses.

1270
01:00:14,790 --> 01:00:15,610
Per day.

1271
01:00:16,490 --> 01:00:17,170
And then like...

1272
01:00:17,170 --> 01:00:18,410
Then the next day you go into...

1273
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:20,170
They go into like a huge gain.

1274
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:21,250
But it's like...

1275
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:23,590
Sometimes they fall all the way to like...

1276
01:00:23,930 --> 01:00:24,390
Uh...

1277
01:00:24,390 --> 01:00:24,570
What?

1278
01:00:24,670 --> 01:00:25,070
Like...

1279
01:00:25,070 --> 01:00:27,910
Eternity 100 from 500 or some shit.

1280
01:00:28,550 --> 01:00:29,270
And that like...

1281
01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:29,610
I don't know.

1282
01:00:29,650 --> 01:00:31,410
That's so fucking depressing.

1283
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:36,270
That's so depressing.

1284
01:00:36,750 --> 01:00:37,170
Wait.

1285
01:00:37,190 --> 01:00:37,630
No Loki?

1286
01:00:38,170 --> 01:00:39,910
Loki is so good though.

1287
01:00:41,490 --> 01:00:43,670
If anything, you might as well go Mantis.

1288
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:48,890
What the fuck?

1289
01:00:52,110 --> 01:00:53,310
Mouse feels weird.

1290
01:00:53,690 --> 01:00:54,050
Alright.

1291
01:00:57,130 --> 01:00:57,770
There you go.

1292
01:00:57,970 --> 01:00:58,390
Now I'm hitting.

1293
01:00:58,890 --> 01:00:59,630
That's so weird.

1294
01:00:59,650 --> 01:01:00,010
I don't know.

1295
01:01:00,350 --> 01:01:00,690
That...

1296
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:01,210
Like...

1297
01:01:01,210 --> 01:01:03,070
That Groot shots were so fucking...

1298
01:01:03,070 --> 01:01:04,430
We soulbond here and then move up.

1299
01:01:05,030 --> 01:01:06,410
Like I don't know if you noticed that.

1300
01:01:06,970 --> 01:01:07,330
Like...

1301
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:09,010
Oh yeah.

1302
01:01:09,050 --> 01:01:10,610
You soulbond that when you get a pick.

1303
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:11,310
Cause then you can...

1304
01:01:12,070 --> 01:01:12,950
Cause there's no reason.

1305
01:01:14,710 --> 01:01:15,170
That's so...

1306
01:01:15,170 --> 01:01:17,190
I like miss every shot on the Groot.

1307
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:18,070
And I have to like...

1308
01:01:18,070 --> 01:01:19,150
Shake my mouse.

1309
01:01:19,270 --> 01:01:20,270
And then I hit every shot.

1310
01:01:23,830 --> 01:01:25,110
That was so weird.

1311
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:28,090
Maybe.

1312
01:01:28,410 --> 01:01:29,890
I've had this mouse for like...

1313
01:01:29,890 --> 01:01:30,210
I think...

1314
01:01:30,870 --> 01:01:31,490
A year...

1315
01:01:32,050 --> 01:01:32,490
Uh...

1316
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:33,670
Hmm...

1317
01:01:33,670 --> 01:01:34,330
I think like...

1318
01:01:34,830 --> 01:01:35,890
A year and a half?

1319
01:01:37,270 --> 01:01:37,710
Yeah.

1320
01:01:37,790 --> 01:01:39,850
Maybe I just need a mental reset there for that.

1321
01:01:40,370 --> 01:01:40,870
But I did...

1322
01:01:40,870 --> 01:01:41,390
I was...

1323
01:01:41,390 --> 01:01:44,250
Every time I get a pick, I just like soulbond and walk forward.

1324
01:01:44,690 --> 01:01:45,730
Cause it makes sense.

1325
01:01:46,430 --> 01:01:47,210
I don't know.

1326
01:01:48,970 --> 01:01:50,110
Cause it's like...

1327
01:01:50,110 --> 01:01:50,390
Alright.

1328
01:01:50,530 --> 01:01:51,230
We get a pick.

1329
01:01:51,590 --> 01:01:52,670
Now we live forever.

1330
01:01:55,350 --> 01:01:56,150
Let me through!

1331
01:01:56,150 --> 01:01:56,550
Let me through!

1332
01:01:58,990 --> 01:01:59,430
Okay.

1333
01:01:59,590 --> 01:01:59,930
Nice.

1334
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:02,970
Let me in!

1335
01:02:03,030 --> 01:02:03,530
Let me in!

1336
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:05,110
I wanna fight!

1337
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:06,330
Let's go!

1338
01:02:06,450 --> 01:02:06,630
Oh!

1339
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:07,630
He did the thing too.

1340
01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:09,870
But I use mine aggressively.

1341
01:02:12,290 --> 01:02:13,190
Let me in!

1342
01:02:13,350 --> 01:02:13,630
Okay.

1343
01:02:13,970 --> 01:02:14,850
I have my ult though.

1344
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:16,310
So I don't wanna be that aggressive.

1345
01:02:17,430 --> 01:02:18,830
I hope my teammate lives.

1346
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:20,350
Alright.

1347
01:02:22,330 --> 01:02:22,770
Oh!

1348
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:24,430
Oh!

1349
01:02:24,430 --> 01:02:25,850
I hope he got some kills.

1350
01:02:31,730 --> 01:02:32,250
Oh.

1351
01:02:34,670 --> 01:02:35,430
Oh no.

1352
01:02:35,970 --> 01:02:37,350
I'm not there to help him.

1353
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:39,670
Okay.

1354
01:02:40,530 --> 01:02:41,150
Don't worry.

1355
01:02:41,210 --> 01:02:41,750
I got you.

1356
01:02:43,590 --> 01:02:44,050
Haha!

1357
01:02:44,310 --> 01:02:45,030
What are they gonna do?

1358
01:02:45,250 --> 01:02:46,090
Oh shit!

1359
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:48,710
That's a great.

1360
01:02:50,330 --> 01:02:51,270
I'm a hero.

1361
01:02:52,450 --> 01:02:53,670
He's still alive?

1362
01:02:54,710 --> 01:02:55,950
How is he still alive?

1363
01:02:59,010 --> 01:02:59,810
Don't worry.

1364
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:02,150
I'm a hero.

1365
01:03:04,290 --> 01:03:05,650
Where the fuck is this Jeff?

1366
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:06,470
Oh there he is.

1367
01:03:08,450 --> 01:03:08,850
Really?

1368
01:03:09,030 --> 01:03:09,810
I didn't hit him?

1369
01:03:10,570 --> 01:03:12,290
How did he fucking dodge that?

1370
01:03:12,470 --> 01:03:13,390
Don't worry, Luna.

1371
01:03:14,810 --> 01:03:15,410
I believe.

1372
01:03:15,470 --> 01:03:15,590
No!

1373
01:03:15,670 --> 01:03:16,990
Let the Luna 1v1!

1374
01:03:17,970 --> 01:03:18,230
Don't kill.

1375
01:03:18,270 --> 01:03:18,550
Don't kill.

1376
01:03:18,590 --> 01:03:18,870
Don't kill.

1377
01:03:18,950 --> 01:03:19,210
Don't kill.

1378
01:03:19,490 --> 01:03:19,890
Bro!

1379
01:03:19,990 --> 01:03:20,150
What?

1380
01:03:21,870 --> 01:03:22,270
Okay.

1381
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:23,810
Haha!

1382
01:03:24,150 --> 01:03:24,450
Bro!

1383
01:03:24,490 --> 01:03:25,510
He's trying to kill me!

1384
01:03:26,070 --> 01:03:27,750
Our Luna's not even healing me!

1385
01:03:29,990 --> 01:03:30,850
Alright.

1386
01:03:31,830 --> 01:03:34,950
I like stood still and then the Luna also stood still.

1387
01:03:35,110 --> 01:03:37,330
Like I'm still taking damage.

1388
01:03:38,070 --> 01:03:43,050
Like I'm still there.

1389
01:03:46,550 --> 01:03:50,610
I'm surprised that...

1390
01:03:50,610 --> 01:03:50,790
Oh.

1391
01:03:51,370 --> 01:03:52,230
I...

1392
01:03:52,230 --> 01:03:53,450
Don't know.

1393
01:03:54,210 --> 01:03:55,050
Don't worry.

1394
01:03:55,190 --> 01:03:55,650
I poor...

1395
01:03:55,650 --> 01:03:56,090
Oh.

1396
01:03:56,870 --> 01:03:57,610
Okay.

1397
01:03:57,730 --> 01:03:58,710
I'm a little...

1398
01:03:58,710 --> 01:03:59,010
Okay.

1399
01:04:01,870 --> 01:04:02,990
I thought...

1400
01:04:03,710 --> 01:04:05,650
I thought more of us were alive.

1401
01:04:07,370 --> 01:04:10,770
I legitimately thought we had more people.

1402
01:04:11,330 --> 01:04:12,510
I was not counting.

1403
01:04:16,950 --> 01:04:17,790
I hear him.

1404
01:04:18,090 --> 01:04:19,250
He's like behind us.

1405
01:04:20,910 --> 01:04:21,970
Oh they have rocket now.

1406
01:04:23,470 --> 01:04:24,250
Still hear him.

1407
01:04:24,490 --> 01:04:27,790
The only way to counter a flanking Jeff is to ignore a flanking Jeff.

1408
01:04:28,710 --> 01:04:31,910
It's like just ignore his existence and it should be fine.

1409
01:04:34,110 --> 01:04:36,630
I know it's dumb but it's literally the play.

1410
01:04:36,970 --> 01:04:41,070
Cause his entire goal is to make you like turn around.

1411
01:04:42,290 --> 01:04:44,790
So as long as I don't look at him, he doesn't exist.

1412
01:04:45,810 --> 01:04:46,850
And then we lo...

1413
01:04:46,850 --> 01:04:48,330
And then somebody looked at him.

1414
01:04:53,030 --> 01:04:54,570
Somebody looked at him.

1415
01:04:55,590 --> 01:04:56,430
It's fine.

1416
01:04:59,050 --> 01:04:59,950
This is...

1417
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:00,750
I don't know.

1418
01:05:00,850 --> 01:05:01,750
We're using so...

1419
01:05:01,750 --> 01:05:03,470
We're using two DPS ults.

1420
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:06,710
Nice.

1421
01:05:07,010 --> 01:05:08,130
Where's the Jeff again?

1422
01:05:08,950 --> 01:05:10,970
Someone get this menace in society.

1423
01:05:15,130 --> 01:05:16,070
Ignore him.

1424
01:05:18,930 --> 01:05:20,270
Just ignore him.

1425
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:22,010
He's not real.

1426
01:05:22,210 --> 01:05:23,110
He can't hurt you.

1427
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:24,250
He's just a little guy.

1428
01:05:24,870 --> 01:05:26,530
What's this little guy gonna do?

1429
01:05:29,430 --> 01:05:31,190
He's just one small little guy.

1430
01:05:31,570 --> 01:05:32,890
I think our Cloak...

1431
01:05:33,970 --> 01:05:35,210
Goodbye Cloak.

1432
01:05:35,330 --> 01:05:36,830
I don't think...

1433
01:05:41,590 --> 01:05:42,310
Alright.

1434
01:05:42,630 --> 01:05:44,050
I have a feeling that...

1435
01:05:46,450 --> 01:05:47,890
We are...

1436
01:05:47,890 --> 01:05:48,830
No way!

1437
01:05:49,090 --> 01:05:49,750
I'm a hero!

1438
01:05:51,190 --> 01:05:51,990
Oh fuck.

1439
01:05:52,930 --> 01:05:53,630
It's okay.

1440
01:05:53,690 --> 01:05:56,210
I got the Luna before it all went wrong.

1441
01:05:56,570 --> 01:05:57,530
It's okay.

1442
01:05:58,090 --> 01:05:59,330
I don't think he knows.

1443
01:05:59,490 --> 01:06:00,530
You can't...

1444
01:06:02,150 --> 01:06:03,090
Oh my god.

1445
01:06:03,150 --> 01:06:03,970
This fucking sucks.

1446
01:06:04,130 --> 01:06:04,570
I have to reload.

1447
01:06:06,450 --> 01:06:07,710
I had to reload.

1448
01:06:09,030 --> 01:06:10,430
This fucking sucks.

1449
01:06:10,990 --> 01:06:13,590
I had to reload when he ate me!

1450
01:06:16,910 --> 01:06:18,230
It's not fair!

1451
01:06:19,470 --> 01:06:20,530
What happens if I...

1452
01:06:23,490 --> 01:06:23,870
Don't worry.

1453
01:06:23,890 --> 01:06:24,490
I got you!

1454
01:06:25,910 --> 01:06:27,750
Get out of here!

1455
01:06:32,450 --> 01:06:33,350
Don't worry.

1456
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:36,650
I'm keeping track of everybody's HP.

1457
01:06:37,150 --> 01:06:38,230
So do not worry.

1458
01:06:39,970 --> 01:06:40,830
Don't worry.

1459
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:43,050
I'm still keeping track of all your HP guys.

1460
01:06:43,790 --> 01:06:44,490
I'm still...

1461
01:06:45,690 --> 01:06:48,010
I'm still keeping track of it.

1462
01:06:48,230 --> 01:06:48,870
Guys.

1463
01:06:49,790 --> 01:06:50,470
Don't worry.

1464
01:06:52,870 --> 01:06:54,990
I am looking behind me.

1465
01:06:56,590 --> 01:06:57,630
There we go.

1466
01:07:03,670 --> 01:07:04,310
Okay.

1467
01:07:05,790 --> 01:07:09,190
How many games have you won so far?

1468
01:07:09,490 --> 01:07:11,910
Cause I'm on a win streak right now.

1469
01:07:18,090 --> 01:07:19,410
I need to...

1470
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:20,470
I need to know.

1471
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:23,050
How many games have you been winning?

1472
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:29,570
Toki, no!

1473
01:07:33,590 --> 01:07:35,770
I keep forgetting that I'm still reloading.

1474
01:07:36,390 --> 01:07:38,370
Every time I was like...

1475
01:07:38,370 --> 01:07:39,890
It's like a little like...

1476
01:07:39,890 --> 01:07:40,170
Don't worry.

1477
01:07:40,230 --> 01:07:40,730
I got this.

1478
01:07:40,810 --> 01:07:42,510
And I'm like... I reload again.

1479
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:50,250
Okay.

1480
01:07:51,070 --> 01:07:53,890
Chat, how many games have they lost so far?

1481
01:07:53,890 --> 01:07:54,410
Alright.

1482
01:07:59,510 --> 01:08:01,530
How many games?

1483
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:09,550
Damn.

1484
01:08:14,470 --> 01:08:15,470
Damn.

1485
01:08:16,770 --> 01:08:17,770
Damn.

1486
01:08:22,090 --> 01:08:25,810
We won't win but it'll be funny.

1487
01:08:31,550 --> 01:08:32,550
Damn.

1488
01:08:32,710 --> 01:08:33,530
That's rough buddy.

1489
01:08:34,590 --> 01:08:35,590
Zero.

1490
01:08:40,930 --> 01:08:43,190
But did you have fun though?

1491
01:08:46,330 --> 01:08:49,090
You know what's even better than having fun and losing?

1492
01:08:49,810 --> 01:08:50,910
Having fun and winning.

1493
01:08:53,150 --> 01:08:53,910
Wait, hold on.

1494
01:08:54,190 --> 01:08:54,990
This stupid game.

1495
01:08:55,290 --> 01:08:55,610
Wait.

1496
01:08:55,910 --> 01:08:56,370
Wait.

1497
01:08:56,530 --> 01:08:57,430
How far did you...

1498
01:08:57,430 --> 01:08:57,590
Wait.

1499
01:08:57,670 --> 01:08:58,050
Oh shit.

1500
01:08:58,110 --> 01:08:58,770
I can't focus.

1501
01:08:59,230 --> 01:09:01,030
How far did you fall?

1502
01:09:01,650 --> 01:09:01,930
Wait.

1503
01:09:02,050 --> 01:09:04,650
How far did you...

1504
01:09:04,650 --> 01:09:05,870
Get the fuck away from me.

1505
01:09:05,890 --> 01:09:07,050
I'm trying to have a conversation.

1506
01:09:07,270 --> 01:09:08,110
You stupid shark.

1507
01:09:09,550 --> 01:09:11,070
You're distracting me.

1508
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:14,230
Oh shit.

1509
01:09:18,090 --> 01:09:19,170
There we go.

1510
01:09:19,630 --> 01:09:20,050
It's fine.

1511
01:09:20,230 --> 01:09:20,730
Oh shit.

1512
01:09:20,850 --> 01:09:21,630
He got the...

1513
01:09:21,630 --> 01:09:23,490
The Hanzo got our fucking storm.

1514
01:09:24,030 --> 01:09:24,870
That's unlucky.

1515
01:09:28,150 --> 01:09:30,350
I don't even know like what was the drop.

1516
01:09:31,690 --> 01:09:32,930
What's the drop?

1517
01:09:37,910 --> 01:09:38,990
Oh shit.

1518
01:09:40,030 --> 01:09:40,730
Jesus.

1519
01:09:40,870 --> 01:09:42,890
I'm just being pushed around right now.

1520
01:09:43,150 --> 01:09:44,370
I don't know what to do.

1521
01:09:44,590 --> 01:09:45,530
Please tank.

1522
01:09:46,350 --> 01:09:47,190
Push up.

1523
01:09:47,570 --> 01:09:49,530
That's all we want from you.

1524
01:09:50,670 --> 01:09:52,050
Just push up.

1525
01:09:52,970 --> 01:09:56,150
Are you still trying to bother me right now?

1526
01:09:56,330 --> 01:09:58,330
You're still trying to bother me.

1527
01:09:58,750 --> 01:10:00,370
Like get away from me.

1528
01:10:04,550 --> 01:10:05,030
What?

1529
01:10:08,630 --> 01:10:09,910
Not gonna lie.

1530
01:10:10,050 --> 01:10:10,890
I feel...

1531
01:10:10,890 --> 01:10:13,570
Oh, just cause I'm a cat for it.

1532
01:10:13,830 --> 01:10:14,850
Oh, April Fool.

1533
01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:15,950
I forgot April Fool ended.

1534
01:10:16,470 --> 01:10:17,650
I forgot guys.

1535
01:10:17,730 --> 01:10:18,730
Cause April Fool's ended.

1536
01:10:18,870 --> 01:10:20,470
It's time to say goodbye to Doe Kitty.

1537
01:10:20,790 --> 01:10:22,170
I'm gonna take her out back.

1538
01:10:24,150 --> 01:10:25,250
You can buy her.

1539
01:10:26,770 --> 01:10:28,090
Will you save her?

1540
01:10:28,750 --> 01:10:29,230
No!

1541
01:10:30,570 --> 01:10:31,410
Oh shit.

1542
01:10:33,690 --> 01:10:34,390
Let's hope.

1543
01:10:35,130 --> 01:10:35,310
Okay.

1544
01:10:37,130 --> 01:10:38,010
You did it.

1545
01:10:38,110 --> 01:10:38,670
I saved you.

1546
01:10:38,750 --> 01:10:39,230
I'm a hero.

1547
01:10:40,690 --> 01:10:41,150
Okay.

1548
01:10:42,790 --> 01:10:43,250
Goodbye.

1549
01:10:44,230 --> 01:10:44,970
Would I still...

1550
01:10:44,970 --> 01:10:45,590
Wait, do I...

1551
01:10:45,590 --> 01:10:46,450
Am I still in range?

1552
01:10:46,530 --> 01:10:46,730
No!

1553
01:10:46,830 --> 01:10:48,670
When I'm inside him, I don't...

1554
01:10:48,670 --> 01:10:49,170
Aww.

1555
01:10:49,970 --> 01:10:51,010
I was gonna say...

1556
01:10:51,010 --> 01:10:52,810
Do I heal him if I'm inside?

1557
01:10:53,490 --> 01:10:53,890
Don't worry.

1558
01:10:53,930 --> 01:10:55,650
I'm walking over as fast as I can.

1559
01:10:56,250 --> 01:10:58,970
I'm walking over as fast as I can guys.

1560
01:10:59,890 --> 01:11:02,270
I'm running away as fast as I can.

1561
01:11:02,930 --> 01:11:03,270
Hahaha.

1562
01:11:07,030 --> 01:11:08,230
Alright, we're fine.

1563
01:11:10,390 --> 01:11:11,690
That shark was so smart.

1564
01:11:13,710 --> 01:11:15,970
He like ulted me while I was doing my rez.

1565
01:11:16,170 --> 01:11:17,210
I don't think he likes me.

1566
01:11:17,290 --> 01:11:17,870
I've been like...

1567
01:11:17,870 --> 01:11:19,750
I've been like diffing him a little.

1568
01:11:20,830 --> 01:11:22,090
Oh my god, that's a rock!

1569
01:11:22,470 --> 01:11:22,870
Hahaha.

1570
01:11:24,610 --> 01:11:26,530
My map knowledge fucked me over there.

1571
01:11:28,490 --> 01:11:29,430
Okay, it's fine.

1572
01:11:29,430 --> 01:11:29,990
It's fine.

1573
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:35,130
I think it's cause like I don't acknowledge him.

1574
01:11:35,310 --> 01:11:36,090
And then he's mad.

1575
01:11:36,930 --> 01:11:38,410
Like I just look at him once.

1576
01:11:39,410 --> 01:11:40,030
Also like...

1577
01:11:40,450 --> 01:11:43,270
They have been trying to challenge this Hawkeye so much.

1578
01:11:45,010 --> 01:11:45,610
Wait.

1579
01:11:46,790 --> 01:11:47,330
Where's...

1580
01:11:47,330 --> 01:11:48,230
Is this shark still...

1581
01:11:48,230 --> 01:11:48,490
Guys!

1582
01:11:48,630 --> 01:11:49,390
Walk forward!

1583
01:11:50,630 --> 01:11:51,930
It's one shark!

1584
01:11:52,990 --> 01:11:54,710
Just walk forward!

1585
01:11:55,570 --> 01:11:57,570
He can't kill us all!

1586
01:11:59,250 --> 01:12:01,310
What are you afraid of?

1587
01:12:02,270 --> 01:12:04,950
Oh Jesus, I have to use both heals for that.

1588
01:12:06,050 --> 01:12:07,430
It's one guy!

1589
01:12:07,630 --> 01:12:08,690
One tiny man!

1590
01:12:10,750 --> 01:12:11,150
Okay.

1591
01:12:15,550 --> 01:12:15,830
Soulbomb?

1592
01:12:16,390 --> 01:12:17,470
Don't worry, he can't die.

1593
01:12:18,390 --> 01:12:21,570
If he dies with a soulbomb, I would be very...

1594
01:12:23,790 --> 01:12:24,350
Like...

1595
01:12:24,350 --> 01:12:25,710
I'll be very impressed with this.

1596
01:12:28,270 --> 01:12:29,050
What again?

1597
01:12:29,870 --> 01:12:31,450
What if I just walk out of it?

1598
01:12:32,590 --> 01:12:33,650
Like what are you gonna do?

1599
01:12:36,470 --> 01:12:36,910
Nice.

1600
01:12:37,170 --> 01:12:37,370
Nothing.

1601
01:12:38,850 --> 01:12:41,350
I think that Jeff's just gonna eat my ult again.

1602
01:12:42,250 --> 01:12:44,710
If I like...

1603
01:12:45,510 --> 01:12:46,330
Shit, okay.

1604
01:12:46,590 --> 01:12:46,990
It's time.

1605
01:12:47,210 --> 01:12:48,750
Watch the Jeff go yummy yummy!

1606
01:12:54,490 --> 01:12:55,770
I hope you live!

1607
01:12:56,770 --> 01:12:57,670
It's fine, I killed him.

1608
01:12:58,350 --> 01:12:58,870
Nice.

1609
01:12:59,190 --> 01:12:59,910
That was a good trade.

1610
01:13:01,690 --> 01:13:03,210
That was a really good trade.

1611
01:13:05,690 --> 01:13:06,350
It's fine.

1612
01:13:06,770 --> 01:13:07,270
I'm alive.

1613
01:13:08,310 --> 01:13:09,070
I'm alive.

1614
01:13:10,350 --> 01:13:11,290
I'm not afraid.

1615
01:13:13,710 --> 01:13:14,730
Okay, nice.

1616
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:15,550
We lived that.

1617
01:13:16,430 --> 01:13:17,410
Yeah, fuck that shark.

1618
01:13:17,870 --> 01:13:19,090
He went to the wrong neighborhood.

1619
01:13:19,410 --> 01:13:20,230
I'm gonna kill this guy too.

1620
01:13:20,790 --> 01:13:21,310
Watch this.

1621
01:13:23,270 --> 01:13:24,210
He ran away.

1622
01:13:26,070 --> 01:13:27,650
He ran away and I closed it.

1623
01:13:27,750 --> 01:13:28,750
What the fuck?

1624
01:13:28,790 --> 01:13:30,590
You can't just run away and come back.

1625
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:33,430
Either fight me or like don't fight me.

1626
01:13:33,990 --> 01:13:35,810
I'm literally just one guy.

1627
01:13:36,230 --> 01:13:37,170
A perfect being.

1628
01:13:42,790 --> 01:13:43,490
It's fine.

1629
01:13:43,750 --> 01:13:44,550
Oh shit, okay.

1630
01:13:44,630 --> 01:13:45,650
He actually ran for me.

1631
01:13:48,330 --> 01:13:49,270
Yeah, it's fine.

1632
01:13:50,330 --> 01:13:51,970
I was debating if I should waste my rez there.

1633
01:13:52,050 --> 01:13:53,070
Or just walk back.

1634
01:13:53,130 --> 01:13:54,050
But I don't wanna walk back.

1635
01:13:54,210 --> 01:13:55,890
I'm a little lazy.

1636
01:13:57,050 --> 01:13:57,890
Is that Iron Man?

1637
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:03,250
That was Iron Man.

1638
01:14:05,350 --> 01:14:06,170
Stop it!

1639
01:14:06,450 --> 01:14:06,850
Stop!

1640
01:14:07,050 --> 01:14:08,310
You're just tickling me.

1641
01:14:12,230 --> 01:14:14,390
I don't know how people...

1642
01:14:15,030 --> 01:14:17,710
I don't know how people play Iron Man anymore in this elo.

1643
01:14:18,550 --> 01:14:20,610
He knows he's the only one that's not so bonded.

1644
01:14:22,530 --> 01:14:23,490
He's like...

1645
01:14:23,490 --> 01:14:24,470
Oh shit!

1646
01:14:24,990 --> 01:14:26,730
Wait, we had Cloak!

1647
01:14:26,770 --> 01:14:27,930
Why didn't we Cloak her?

1648
01:14:27,970 --> 01:14:28,690
Oh, she died.

1649
01:14:28,990 --> 01:14:29,510
Oh, okay.

1650
01:14:29,890 --> 01:14:31,490
Oh, she's always there.

1651
01:14:32,330 --> 01:14:33,650
Okay, that makes sense.

1652
01:14:33,770 --> 01:14:34,450
Okay, don't worry.

1653
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:35,230
Don't worry.

1654
01:14:35,290 --> 01:14:36,210
I'm here for you.

1655
01:14:38,690 --> 01:14:39,520
I was like...

1656
01:14:41,290 --> 01:14:42,310
Okay, let's go.

1657
01:14:43,010 --> 01:14:44,470
We can still tech...

1658
01:14:44,470 --> 01:14:45,370
I don't know, actually.

1659
01:14:46,010 --> 01:14:46,770
Can we?

1660
01:14:47,190 --> 01:14:47,850
Luna can.

1661
01:14:48,570 --> 01:14:49,950
Oh, I should've went low-key.

1662
01:14:50,890 --> 01:14:52,130
I don't know if they can.

1663
01:14:52,310 --> 01:14:52,630
Yeah.

1664
01:14:52,630 --> 01:14:54,590
That shark actually saved them.

1665
01:14:55,930 --> 01:14:58,130
That was such a good...

1666
01:14:58,130 --> 01:14:59,570
Stomp by them.

1667
01:15:00,510 --> 01:15:01,450
Oh, fuck.

1668
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:02,230
Okay, I'm just gonna run.

1669
01:15:03,130 --> 01:15:04,470
Yeah, that bubble was insane.

1670
01:15:06,370 --> 01:15:08,010
I don't know if I should...

1671
01:15:09,010 --> 01:15:10,390
No, I should just die.

1672
01:15:14,750 --> 01:15:15,710
What's with this Jeff?

1673
01:15:16,190 --> 01:15:17,510
That's how Jeff plays.

1674
01:15:17,770 --> 01:15:19,030
But he's not like...

1675
01:15:19,030 --> 01:15:22,730
particularly the best flanking Jeff I've seen.

1676
01:15:23,910 --> 01:15:26,330
Because he doesn't actually kill.

1677
01:15:26,430 --> 01:15:28,190
He's just really, really annoying.

1678
01:15:28,930 --> 01:15:29,430
Honestly.

1679
01:15:30,370 --> 01:15:32,210
I don't see him as incredibly annoying.

1680
01:15:32,530 --> 01:15:33,730
But he does not make...

1681
01:15:34,790 --> 01:15:38,310
He doesn't really do much for the team.

1682
01:15:39,550 --> 01:15:41,570
I just see him as incredibly annoying.

1683
01:15:45,790 --> 01:15:46,990
Oh, shit!

1684
01:15:47,130 --> 01:15:47,450
Okay.

1685
01:15:48,070 --> 01:15:50,050
I didn't think it'd be two of them.

1686
01:15:52,730 --> 01:15:53,650
Let's see.

1687
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,040
Did I grab them?

1688
01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:00,180
I don't know if I did.

1689
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:04,780
There we go.

1690
01:16:09,270 --> 01:16:10,710
Oh, did I get everybody?

1691
01:16:10,970 --> 01:16:11,190
Nah.

1692
01:16:11,350 --> 01:16:11,610
Okay.

1693
01:16:12,350 --> 01:16:13,970
I'll try to see if I can grab.

1694
01:16:15,770 --> 01:16:16,250
Oh.

1695
01:16:17,090 --> 01:16:17,570
Unlucky.

1696
01:16:20,070 --> 01:16:21,010
Alright, give me a sec.

1697
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:22,750
And then...

1698
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:23,590
So I can go for him.

1699
01:16:26,330 --> 01:16:27,110
There we go.

1700
01:16:27,810 --> 01:16:29,530
Guys, we have to...

1701
01:16:30,410 --> 01:16:31,090
Please!

1702
01:16:31,570 --> 01:16:34,030
Why do we keep leaving our...

1703
01:16:34,030 --> 01:16:36,530
Our tanks for one little guy?

1704
01:16:38,070 --> 01:16:39,230
The fact that we...

1705
01:16:42,010 --> 01:16:42,690
Please.

1706
01:16:42,870 --> 01:16:44,110
It's literally one shark.

1707
01:16:45,010 --> 01:16:47,290
Why are we so scared of him?

1708
01:16:48,690 --> 01:16:51,990
Literally everybody turned around for the shark.

1709
01:16:53,830 --> 01:16:55,590
And then we left her.

1710
01:16:55,590 --> 01:16:56,110
We...

1711
01:16:56,110 --> 01:16:58,970
We left her strange again.

1712
01:17:00,210 --> 01:17:01,170
Oh, we did.

1713
01:17:01,250 --> 01:17:01,530
I did.

1714
01:17:01,570 --> 01:17:02,430
I claimed the...

1715
01:17:02,430 --> 01:17:03,270
I claimed it.

1716
01:17:06,950 --> 01:17:09,010
There's another Nintendo Direct?

1717
01:17:10,030 --> 01:17:12,190
What do they just get a Nintendo Direct?

1718
01:17:12,470 --> 01:17:13,170
I'm surprised.

1719
01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:14,590
We got another one.

1720
01:17:17,190 --> 01:17:18,150
Okay, guys.

1721
01:17:18,190 --> 01:17:21,110
Let's not all turn around for the Jeff.

1722
01:17:23,030 --> 01:17:24,570
Oh, is this for the Switch too?

1723
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:30,180
I don't know.

1724
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:31,880
Because I do have a 1230 stream.

1725
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:33,180
I don't know if I want to wake up...

1726
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:36,800
Wake up even earlier.

1727
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:39,500
I'm not that type of person to be fair.

1728
01:17:52,020 --> 01:17:53,220
Oh, let's go.

1729
01:17:55,420 --> 01:17:56,380
It's literally...

1730
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:58,540
Like our team just needs to ignore him.

1731
01:17:59,420 --> 01:18:00,380
He's literally...

1732
01:18:00,380 --> 01:18:02,680
He's not doing as much as they think he's doing.

1733
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:04,420
He has 810.

1734
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:07,000
He has 10 deaths and 8 kills.

1735
01:18:07,180 --> 01:18:10,160
All he does is just be a fucking nuisance.

1736
01:18:11,260 --> 01:18:14,000
But we killed the entire team and then we killed Jeff.

1737
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:15,520
Or one person killed Jeff.

1738
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:32,280
Here we go.

1739
01:18:32,620 --> 01:18:33,240
Oh, portal.

1740
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:34,980
Except for the Jeff.

1741
01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:37,880
That's just...

1742
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:39,440
Okay, I don't have...

1743
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:40,520
Bad target set.

1744
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:43,200
Okay, I don't have snaps now.

1745
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:45,320
So I have to use Soul Bond if they need help.

1746
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:48,400
Oh my god, really?

1747
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:50,060
I have to use...

1748
01:18:50,060 --> 01:18:50,340
No!

1749
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:52,020
My Soul Bond didn't work.

1750
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:52,900
Fuck.

1751
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:57,320
That sucked.

1752
01:18:57,940 --> 01:18:59,080
I'm not wasting Soul Bond.

1753
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:02,640
Oh, I got deleted too fast.

1754
01:19:04,380 --> 01:19:06,080
Guys, I don't think we're gonna...

1755
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:08,340
Guys, it's because Gomez jumped in and then...

1756
01:19:13,180 --> 01:19:15,520
They rubbed their last streak on him.

1757
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:20,460
He gave the curse.

1758
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,180
Guys, I was stomping.

1759
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:24,140
Not gonna lie.

1760
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:28,360
Okay.

1761
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:33,220
Was my team not fucking stomping hard though?

1762
01:19:33,740 --> 01:19:35,440
Were they not, guys?

1763
01:19:40,380 --> 01:19:41,660
Okay, this is bad.

1764
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:43,580
Oh, this is very bad.

1765
01:19:43,660 --> 01:19:45,240
We have no support ults for this.

1766
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:46,600
And I already used my Soul Bond.

1767
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:50,880
Oh my god, are you serious?

1768
01:19:51,060 --> 01:19:51,420
No!

1769
01:19:51,540 --> 01:19:53,560
And then we used Cloak!

1770
01:19:54,020 --> 01:19:56,940
I don't know.

1771
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:01,080
That's really bad for us.

1772
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:05,500
Because I don't even have...

1773
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:05,840
Okay.

1774
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:07,640
I'm trying.

1775
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:10,860
I'm trying my best.

1776
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:14,460
Okay, we have to back out.

1777
01:20:15,340 --> 01:20:16,400
There's no way.

1778
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:18,220
We have to back out and live this one.

1779
01:20:18,660 --> 01:20:19,360
We can rez here.

1780
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:21,420
I cannot rez this.

1781
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:22,020
No.

1782
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:24,020
Oh, I can't.

1783
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:25,080
He's too far.

1784
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:26,960
He's way too far.

1785
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:30,960
Oh my god, I can't do anything.

1786
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:32,900
That Jeff ulted really well.

1787
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:34,040
He was so far!

1788
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:36,080
He died so ahead.

1789
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:39,940
That's unlucky.

1790
01:20:44,060 --> 01:20:45,080
Oh no.

1791
01:20:47,740 --> 01:20:49,480
There, Jeff did a really good ult there.

1792
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:50,900
And we died too ahead.

1793
01:20:53,860 --> 01:20:54,840
I don't...

1794
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:55,280
No.

1795
01:20:57,080 --> 01:20:57,960
Alright, go up.

1796
01:20:58,040 --> 01:20:58,400
Go up!

1797
01:20:58,400 --> 01:20:59,740
Go up, I soulbonded.

1798
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:00,460
Go up!

1799
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:03,320
Why are you scared?

1800
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:05,040
Okay.

1801
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:08,240
Oh, they all got off.

1802
01:21:08,380 --> 01:21:08,660
Okay.

1803
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:15,960
Oh my god.

1804
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:19,000
I was like, what are you guys doing?

1805
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:19,920
Just run!

1806
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:21,200
Get out there!

1807
01:21:23,780 --> 01:21:24,080
Alright.

1808
01:21:25,340 --> 01:21:26,560
I'm gonna go lowkey.

1809
01:21:29,420 --> 01:21:30,820
Actually, I don't know.

1810
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:33,580
Against Jeff?

1811
01:21:36,660 --> 01:21:38,100
Against Jeff...

1812
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:40,500
Adam and lowkey are both good.

1813
01:21:41,180 --> 01:21:41,920
For Jeff.

1814
01:21:42,980 --> 01:21:43,540
But like...

1815
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:48,640
I think we might need three support ults.

1816
01:21:49,860 --> 01:21:53,500
Three support ults is better than two support ults.

1817
01:21:54,220 --> 01:21:57,320
My team has been not getting support ults.

1818
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:57,900
I don't know.

1819
01:21:58,300 --> 01:22:02,700
I feel like I've been doing a lot damaging wise too.

1820
01:22:02,780 --> 01:22:04,320
I've been getting kills as well.

1821
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:05,960
No, I can't play flanker Jeff.

1822
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:06,920
I don't know the tech.

1823
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:09,860
I'm not good with doing the tech stuff.

1824
01:22:12,180 --> 01:22:14,980
I feel like I've been contributing in damage too.

1825
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,020
So, I don't know.

1826
01:22:18,140 --> 01:22:21,140
I'm better at killing Jeff on Adam than I am on lowkey.

1827
01:22:21,460 --> 01:22:22,940
Cause his is more hitscan.

1828
01:22:24,140 --> 01:22:24,600
Oh...

1829
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:25,700
Fuck.

1830
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:28,360
Alright, if we lose this is my fault cause I'm lowkey.

1831
01:22:31,740 --> 01:22:33,130
I should have been on...

1832
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:34,780
If we lose this...

1833
01:22:34,780 --> 01:22:36,160
No, actually I'm gonna go Adam.

1834
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:37,740
We have two flyers.

1835
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:39,820
We have two flyers.

1836
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:40,620
I'm gonna go Adam.

1837
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:44,140
Just cause like...

1838
01:22:44,140 --> 01:22:45,520
It's easier...

1839
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:46,980
It's easier to heal.

1840
01:22:49,540 --> 01:22:50,240
There we go.

1841
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,380
That strange is...

1842
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:55,260
Trying to survive.

1843
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:56,760
Good for you.

1844
01:22:59,060 --> 01:23:01,680
I'm trying to keep track of...

1845
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:03,620
The people who needs heals behind us.

1846
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:07,120
You're fine.

1847
01:23:09,380 --> 01:23:09,940
Alright.

1848
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:14,280
Don't worry, you're fine.

1849
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:16,460
So, I have to use this but you should be fine.

1850
01:23:16,460 --> 01:23:16,960
You're fine.

1851
01:23:19,340 --> 01:23:21,940
We need to get a kill with that soulbond but that's...

1852
01:23:21,940 --> 01:23:22,720
Oh, that's fine.

1853
01:23:22,860 --> 01:23:23,080
Yep.

1854
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:24,640
That can be our kill.

1855
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:28,900
That can be our kill.

1856
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:29,820
Alright.

1857
01:23:32,580 --> 01:23:33,100
Oh...

1858
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:35,380
That was a good inbound though.

1859
01:23:37,340 --> 01:23:37,860
Please!

1860
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:40,520
There's literally a mag in front of us!

1861
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:42,820
Alright.

1862
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:45,240
I don't have soulbond.

1863
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:47,060
Oh, that's fine.

1864
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:49,500
I'm just gonna reload.

1865
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:53,280
Before I do this.

1866
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:58,600
I'll just reload in front of them, it's fine.

1867
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:04,200
Alright.

1868
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:07,480
Jeff is just gonna try and eat us all.

1869
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:09,640
So...

1870
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:10,120
Scary!

1871
01:24:12,700 --> 01:24:13,420
Scary!

1872
01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:15,800
Woah!

1873
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:17,740
Scary Jeff!

1874
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:20,220
He's gonna try and eat us all!

1875
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:23,180
I don't know what to do about that!

1876
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:24,020
Whoops!

1877
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:25,560
Almost knocked myself out!

1878
01:24:28,990 --> 01:24:31,330
Just gonna try and knock us out!

1879
01:24:33,710 --> 01:24:33,950
Oh.

1880
01:24:36,930 --> 01:24:37,570
Alright.

1881
01:24:38,470 --> 01:24:39,050
Oh!

1882
01:24:39,570 --> 01:24:40,310
Oh, nice, nice!

1883
01:24:40,330 --> 01:24:40,630
We got him.

1884
01:24:43,410 --> 01:24:44,050
Nice.

1885
01:24:47,210 --> 01:24:48,390
That's fine.

1886
01:24:50,870 --> 01:24:52,250
He knows I'm there now!

1887
01:24:55,330 --> 01:24:55,710
Alright.

1888
01:24:57,090 --> 01:24:58,610
What if I...

1889
01:25:05,030 --> 01:25:05,510
Nice.

1890
01:25:06,450 --> 01:25:07,710
I actually...

1891
01:25:09,170 --> 01:25:10,710
Oh no, this is bad.

1892
01:25:11,830 --> 01:25:12,970
Oh, this is okay.

1893
01:25:16,940 --> 01:25:18,060
Oh no!

1894
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:19,280
That's fine.

1895
01:25:20,420 --> 01:25:21,120
Guys, guys!

1896
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:22,180
Guys!

1897
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:23,220
Nice.

1898
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:26,640
Where?

1899
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:29,560
Okay.

1900
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:33,080
Their Jeff is coming over for a good yummy yummy.

1901
01:25:33,660 --> 01:25:35,840
Which is very worrisome right now.

1902
01:25:38,140 --> 01:25:39,200
Their Jeff's looking for it.

1903
01:25:41,340 --> 01:25:44,300
Their Jeff is looking for it right now.

1904
01:25:46,940 --> 01:25:47,240
Okay.

1905
01:25:49,940 --> 01:25:50,540
Nice.

1906
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:53,480
Oh!

1907
01:25:54,140 --> 01:25:54,740
That's fine.

1908
01:26:00,470 --> 01:26:01,670
Please, please, please, please, please.

1909
01:26:03,430 --> 01:26:05,370
Please live, please live, please live, please live.

1910
01:26:06,990 --> 01:26:08,050
Oh my god, he lives!

1911
01:26:08,150 --> 01:26:08,330
Okay.

1912
01:26:11,470 --> 01:26:12,350
Okay, he lives.

1913
01:26:12,430 --> 01:26:12,670
Okay.

1914
01:26:13,390 --> 01:26:13,870
Thank god.

1915
01:26:15,770 --> 01:26:16,530
I was a little worried.

1916
01:26:20,090 --> 01:26:20,990
Alright, that's fine.

1917
01:26:22,270 --> 01:26:22,670
Oh!

1918
01:26:24,710 --> 01:26:25,390
Oh!

1919
01:26:25,390 --> 01:26:26,050
There's the shark.

1920
01:26:26,190 --> 01:26:27,570
Please kill the shark!

1921
01:26:30,410 --> 01:26:31,070
Oh!

1922
01:26:32,850 --> 01:26:33,990
Kill him!

1923
01:26:34,790 --> 01:26:35,670
Alright, we did it.

1924
01:26:36,990 --> 01:26:38,430
Oh my god.

1925
01:26:39,410 --> 01:26:40,350
That was scary.

1926
01:26:40,730 --> 01:26:42,190
I was like, don't stream!

1927
01:26:42,550 --> 01:26:43,630
Just live stream!

1928
01:26:44,070 --> 01:26:44,970
Just live!

1929
01:26:47,270 --> 01:26:47,950
Nice!

1930
01:26:48,290 --> 01:26:49,350
Thank you for the dollars!

1931
01:26:49,510 --> 01:26:50,450
Thank you!

1932
01:26:50,450 --> 01:26:52,250
And Piri, thank you for the ring!

1933
01:26:52,290 --> 01:26:53,030
I really appreciate it!

1934
01:26:53,050 --> 01:26:53,770
Thank you, thank you!

1935
01:26:53,810 --> 01:26:55,390
Oh my god, my heart was beating fast there.

1936
01:26:57,710 --> 01:26:58,730
Oh my god.

1937
01:26:59,410 --> 01:27:01,170
My heart was beating so fast.

1938
01:27:01,190 --> 01:27:01,950
That was a game.

1939
01:27:08,170 --> 01:27:10,290
Let me check something real quick.

1940
01:27:16,670 --> 01:27:17,530
What's the record?

1941
01:27:25,450 --> 01:27:26,250
What's the record?

1942
01:27:26,250 --> 01:27:27,450
I'm currently...

1943
01:27:32,070 --> 01:27:34,390
He almost cursed me.

1944
01:27:45,110 --> 01:27:47,770
If they win their next game...

1945
01:27:48,130 --> 01:27:50,330
If they win their next game, guys...

1946
01:27:53,190 --> 01:27:54,310
If they...

1947
01:27:54,310 --> 01:27:54,830
If they win...

1948
01:27:54,830 --> 01:27:55,290
If they win...

1949
01:27:55,290 --> 01:27:56,350
I'm avoiding their Jeff.

1950
01:27:56,530 --> 01:27:58,470
Their Jeff was like, just fucking annoying.

1951
01:27:58,650 --> 01:28:00,010
And he doesn't do jack shit.

1952
01:28:04,390 --> 01:28:06,170
He's getting up!

1953
01:28:17,650 --> 01:28:19,730
Did they lose their last game?

1954
01:28:19,930 --> 01:28:21,050
What's going on?

1955
01:28:28,060 --> 01:28:28,940
They won?

1956
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:32,980
Do I really want to end the win streak?

1957
01:28:33,100 --> 01:28:33,940
Oh, you're so right.

1958
01:28:34,160 --> 01:28:34,940
You're so...

1959
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:37,660
You're so right.

1960
01:28:38,100 --> 01:28:38,940
Oh shit!

1961
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:39,340
Whoops.

1962
01:28:39,640 --> 01:28:40,020
I forgot.

1963
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:41,960
Whenever I type, I forgot.

1964
01:28:42,100 --> 01:28:45,280
That was like the only thing I turned on.

1965
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:46,600
It was my fish.

1966
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:48,480
Wait, which one was my fish again?

1967
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:50,480
I forgot which one it was.

1968
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:52,240
Which one was the button for my fish?

1969
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,560
Oh my god, I don't remember.

1970
01:28:59,260 --> 01:29:01,100
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

1971
01:29:01,340 --> 01:29:02,700
Yum, yum, yum.

1972
01:29:04,060 --> 01:29:04,500
I don't remember.

1973
01:29:04,700 --> 01:29:05,660
Oh, it's this one.

1974
01:29:05,940 --> 01:29:06,460
Oh yeah.

1975
01:29:07,220 --> 01:29:08,220
It's this one.

1976
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:10,560
You know what that means.

1977
01:29:10,660 --> 01:29:11,240
I'm hungry.

1978
01:29:11,660 --> 01:29:12,640
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

1979
01:29:29,810 --> 01:29:32,330
For those who are like, what's their record?

1980
01:29:34,710 --> 01:29:36,470
What their record is.

1981
01:29:38,230 --> 01:29:39,610
This is...

1982
01:29:39,610 --> 01:29:41,710
This is their...

1983
01:29:51,370 --> 01:29:52,630
What's my record?

1984
01:29:53,370 --> 01:29:54,930
Well, it looks beautiful.

1985
01:29:55,530 --> 01:29:56,690
Look at my record, guys.

1986
01:29:59,770 --> 01:30:02,270
Wow, what a beautiful record.

1987
01:30:02,270 --> 01:30:05,810
Now let's look over to this other record over there.

1988
01:30:05,910 --> 01:30:07,550
Let's see what the problem is.

1989
01:30:07,550 --> 01:30:14,270
Let's see what the problem is over there.

1990
01:30:22,150 --> 01:30:25,130
I think the color is reversed.

1991
01:30:26,910 --> 01:30:29,270
I'm surprised they even got...

1992
01:30:32,270 --> 01:30:32,670
Okay.

1993
01:30:33,270 --> 01:30:34,650
Alright, we'll cut a deal.

1994
01:30:35,890 --> 01:30:37,230
We'll cut a deal.

1995
01:30:38,990 --> 01:30:40,430
The moment...

1996
01:30:40,430 --> 01:30:42,350
I lose my win streak...

1997
01:30:43,010 --> 01:30:43,550
I'll play.

1998
01:30:44,130 --> 01:30:45,890
So I'll have nothing to lose.

1999
01:30:50,070 --> 01:30:50,970
No more.

2000
01:30:57,490 --> 01:30:59,510
You guys can't wait that long.

2001
01:31:00,310 --> 01:31:01,670
We'll do it next time.

2002
01:31:02,270 --> 01:31:03,470
And then...

2003
01:31:03,470 --> 01:31:04,190
And then...

2004
01:31:04,190 --> 01:31:08,310
I will be willing to commit a full loss streak with you guys.

2005
01:31:10,690 --> 01:31:11,370
Sniper!

2006
01:31:12,430 --> 01:31:13,450
And then...

2007
01:31:13,790 --> 01:31:15,910
And then, I'll be willing...

2008
01:31:15,910 --> 01:31:18,670
If we lose four to five games...

2009
01:31:18,670 --> 01:31:19,350
Don't worry.

2010
01:31:19,590 --> 01:31:22,230
I'm willing to commit to this account.

2011
01:31:24,730 --> 01:31:26,730
They waited 20...

2012
01:31:26,730 --> 01:31:28,770
I didn't tell them to wait!

2013
01:31:29,030 --> 01:31:30,870
I was playing my game!

2014
01:31:32,270 --> 01:31:34,410
I was in my own game!

2015
01:31:35,270 --> 01:31:36,150
What do you mean?

2016
01:31:36,330 --> 01:31:39,710
How is that my fault that they waited 20 minutes?

2017
01:31:45,530 --> 01:31:47,330
Toki, it's your fault.

2018
01:31:47,630 --> 01:31:48,590
Help him.

2019
01:31:52,530 --> 01:31:55,490
I didn't even know they were waiting!

2020
01:31:57,190 --> 01:32:02,930
I like how someone's like, If they can wait 20 minutes, they can wait 20 minutes more.

2021
01:32:08,970 --> 01:32:09,770
Then...

2022
01:32:10,430 --> 01:32:11,830
Then, don't worry.

2023
01:32:12,530 --> 01:32:13,470
Next time...

2024
01:32:14,730 --> 01:32:16,330
Next time...

2025
01:32:16,330 --> 01:32:17,490
If you guys can't wait...

2026
01:32:18,010 --> 01:32:19,770
The next time...

2027
01:32:19,770 --> 01:32:23,070
I can commit throughout the loss streaks.

2028
01:32:23,070 --> 01:32:23,970
Damn.

2029
01:32:27,310 --> 01:32:29,090
You're so cruel.

2030
01:32:29,470 --> 01:32:31,050
What did I do?

2031
01:32:31,690 --> 01:32:32,910
What did I do?

2032
01:32:34,530 --> 01:32:35,010
Alright.

2033
01:32:35,330 --> 01:32:36,250
Or you can snipe me.

2034
01:32:36,490 --> 01:32:36,850
Snipe me.

2035
01:32:36,990 --> 01:32:38,090
You guys are low enough, right?

2036
01:32:38,690 --> 01:32:39,490
Are you guys low enough?

2037
01:32:39,590 --> 01:32:40,730
Don't worry, let's snipe each other.

2038
01:32:41,150 --> 01:32:41,890
I'll do a countdown.

2039
01:32:46,090 --> 01:32:48,210
You guys are low enough now, right?

2040
01:32:55,650 --> 01:32:56,020
Alright.

2041
01:32:57,560 --> 01:32:58,300
3...

2042
01:32:58,300 --> 01:32:59,360
2...

2043
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:00,080
1...

2044
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:00,740
Let's go.

2045
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:03,880
Bro, that's messed...

2046
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:04,000
What?

2047
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:05,360
What?

2048
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:07,880
I'm ready.

2049
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:13,560
Wouldn't it be crazy if we did get into each other?

2050
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:15,280
That would be fucking crazy.

2051
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:17,140
Imagine...

2052
01:33:17,140 --> 01:33:18,160
Oh, then it's freelo.

2053
01:33:18,160 --> 01:33:18,260
Freelo.

2054
01:33:27,770 --> 01:33:28,690
Alright, let's see.

2055
01:33:33,010 --> 01:33:34,650
Karmas, thank you for the 300 bitties.

2056
01:33:34,750 --> 01:33:35,790
Thank you, thank you.

2057
01:33:35,890 --> 01:33:37,490
Vaan, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

2058
01:33:37,630 --> 01:33:38,810
Thank you, thank you.

2059
01:33:42,030 --> 01:33:46,250
I would literally cry at your what pranksters loss streak.

2060
01:33:47,710 --> 01:33:49,610
I give it and I take it.

2061
01:33:50,300 --> 01:33:51,430
Okay, QOD what?

2062
01:33:51,830 --> 01:33:53,390
Okay, okay, okay.

2063
01:33:54,050 --> 01:33:54,430
Here.

2064
01:33:58,630 --> 01:33:59,730
Here you go.

2065
01:34:02,100 --> 01:34:03,390
We'll see how it goes.

2066
01:34:05,450 --> 01:34:06,630
Alright, let me do my...

2067
01:34:06,630 --> 01:34:08,710
You can snipe me in Doom matches too.

2068
01:34:08,790 --> 01:34:09,230
Let's go.

2069
01:34:11,410 --> 01:34:14,130
I can't believe you guys waited 20 minutes.

2070
01:34:17,190 --> 01:34:17,850
Alright.

2071
01:34:18,930 --> 01:34:19,890
Let's see.

2072
01:34:20,630 --> 01:34:23,130
Don't worry, I'm in Oregon Doom matches too.

2073
01:34:23,270 --> 01:34:24,990
Snipe me there as well if you can.

2074
01:34:26,950 --> 01:34:27,630
Alright.

2075
01:34:27,990 --> 01:34:30,430
Are these real people in my Doom matches?

2076
01:34:33,610 --> 01:34:34,290
Listen.

2077
01:34:36,770 --> 01:34:38,330
Oh, no they're not.

2078
01:34:38,670 --> 01:34:40,150
No, they're not.

2079
01:34:40,710 --> 01:34:41,210
They definitely...

2080
01:34:41,590 --> 01:34:46,870
Oh fuck.

2081
01:34:47,230 --> 01:34:47,810
Oh shit.

2082
01:34:48,230 --> 01:34:48,870
Oh shit.

2083
01:34:48,870 --> 01:34:50,290
I gotta run.

2084
01:34:50,470 --> 01:34:51,970
I gotta run.

2085
01:34:53,390 --> 01:34:54,830
Oh no.

2086
01:34:54,970 --> 01:34:56,290
I gotta run.

2087
01:34:56,870 --> 01:34:58,890
No, Starly you don't understand.

2088
01:34:59,690 --> 01:35:00,690
I fucked up.

2089
01:35:01,730 --> 01:35:03,690
I fucked up Starly.

2090
01:35:04,190 --> 01:35:05,870
You don't understand.

2091
01:35:07,030 --> 01:35:07,350
Run.

2092
01:35:08,430 --> 01:35:09,110
Oh no.

2093
01:35:11,850 --> 01:35:12,510
Oh no.

2094
01:35:13,430 --> 01:35:15,230
Okay, I'm safe right now.

2095
01:35:16,530 --> 01:35:17,450
Okay, oh no.

2096
01:35:18,310 --> 01:35:20,510
You don't know where I actually am.

2097
01:35:21,370 --> 01:35:24,070
You're in Grave Danger.

2098
01:35:35,870 --> 01:35:37,490
It's okay, we're safe.

2099
01:35:39,670 --> 01:35:40,690
Oh, what the fuck?

2100
01:35:43,110 --> 01:35:43,870
Goodbye.

2101
01:35:45,950 --> 01:35:46,710
Disappear.

2102
01:35:48,830 --> 01:35:49,590
Disappear.

2103
01:35:49,590 --> 01:35:50,490
Run.

2104
01:35:52,330 --> 01:35:53,250
You don't know.

2105
01:35:54,370 --> 01:35:55,210
I've disappeared.

2106
01:35:57,300 --> 01:35:58,090
Oh shit.

2107
01:35:59,330 --> 01:35:59,890
Disappear.

2108
01:36:00,350 --> 01:36:00,630
No.

2109
01:36:02,280 --> 01:36:02,690
No.

2110
01:36:03,310 --> 01:36:07,130
I refuse to believe it wasn't stream sniping chat.

2111
01:36:07,570 --> 01:36:09,310
That had to be stream sniping.

2112
01:36:09,350 --> 01:36:10,270
There's no way.

2113
01:36:10,850 --> 01:36:14,250
I can't believe it.

2114
01:36:14,450 --> 01:36:16,770
Stream sniping in my Doom match?

2115
01:36:17,350 --> 01:36:18,170
That's crazy.

2116
01:36:19,590 --> 01:36:21,650
It's like hide and seek right now.

2117
01:36:25,420 --> 01:36:26,520
Where am I?

2118
01:36:27,980 --> 01:36:28,540
Whoa.

2119
01:36:31,480 --> 01:36:33,180
I think I'm safe guys.

2120
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:35,100
I think I'm safe.

2121
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:39,100
I feel like there's barely anyone playing in Oregon server.

2122
01:36:39,480 --> 01:36:42,600
I barely ever get games in Oregon.

2123
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:46,820
I feel like there's almost zero games in this server in general.

2124
01:36:47,380 --> 01:36:48,340
Oh, they got a game.

2125
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:49,460
They got a game!

2126
01:36:49,460 --> 01:36:54,140
They got a game.

2127
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:55,660
Alright, you know what that means.

2128
01:36:56,200 --> 01:36:57,060
Getting out of Oregon.

2129
01:36:57,180 --> 01:36:58,340
I won a fucking game.

2130
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:01,460
I feel like I, yeah, I like never.

2131
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:05,860
I like get like one West Coast server every like 10 games.

2132
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:07,080
Yeah, they're gone.

2133
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:08,960
I was like, they actually did disappear.

2134
01:37:14,530 --> 01:37:16,010
Oh my god.

2135
01:37:16,270 --> 01:37:16,730
They're gone.

2136
01:37:17,470 --> 01:37:18,970
Alright, back into my Doom matches.

2137
01:37:22,010 --> 01:37:26,910
I feel like there's like not a lot of servers in...

2138
01:37:26,910 --> 01:37:27,090
Oh.

2139
01:37:30,350 --> 01:37:32,030
I was like...

2140
01:37:32,030 --> 01:37:33,730
Oh, I didn't see this guy over there.

2141
01:37:34,490 --> 01:37:36,590
I feel like there's not a lot of...

2142
01:37:37,190 --> 01:37:37,490
Wait.

2143
01:37:38,450 --> 01:37:39,390
Who's that?

2144
01:37:41,530 --> 01:37:42,410
What the fuck?

2145
01:37:42,490 --> 01:37:44,370
Who's Dookie's cat ears?

2146
01:37:44,890 --> 01:37:46,390
Who the fuck was that?

2147
01:37:48,250 --> 01:37:50,950
Wait, who the fuck was in that Doom match?

2148
01:37:52,810 --> 01:37:54,390
Who's that guy?

2149
01:37:59,410 --> 01:38:00,930
What the fuck?

2150
01:38:02,310 --> 01:38:03,290
Oh my god.

2151
01:38:03,390 --> 01:38:06,110
I have several people trying to snipe me now.

2152
01:38:09,610 --> 01:38:11,690
They just debuted today.

2153
01:38:11,810 --> 01:38:13,290
I was here to count already.

2154
01:38:14,590 --> 01:38:16,950
They just came out today.

2155
01:38:18,310 --> 01:38:22,130
Dookie, he only existed like a couple of hours ago.

2156
01:38:22,130 --> 01:38:23,290
Are we roleplaying?

2157
01:38:25,010 --> 01:38:26,970
We're watching a shark 1v1.

2158
01:38:27,770 --> 01:38:29,770
Ooh, it's the sharkiest shark of all.

2159
01:38:31,870 --> 01:38:33,090
Alright, we killed a winner.

2160
01:38:36,790 --> 01:38:39,090
There's no true winners in the Jeff fight.

2161
01:38:40,250 --> 01:38:41,630
You dude was wait...

2162
01:38:41,630 --> 01:38:46,970
I think he was waiting for me to show up and then he literally got a game the moment I showed up.

2163
01:38:47,070 --> 01:38:48,110
That's so fucked up.

2164
01:38:51,590 --> 01:38:53,270
Hello, little guy.

2165
01:38:53,890 --> 01:38:57,130
Which one is the emote button in Rivalous anyway?

2166
01:39:00,250 --> 01:39:01,730
Which one is it?

2167
01:39:02,270 --> 01:39:02,790
Oh, a T?

2168
01:39:02,930 --> 01:39:03,310
Is it a T?

2169
01:39:03,410 --> 01:39:03,710
Oh!

2170
01:39:05,150 --> 01:39:08,490
Whoa, I've never used emotes before in Rivalous.

2171
01:39:09,090 --> 01:39:10,600
I hope they have actual...

2172
01:39:13,790 --> 01:39:15,810
good skins soon for supports.

2173
01:39:16,790 --> 01:39:22,330
Like I said, I feel like the only good support skin so far is the present Loki.

2174
01:39:23,530 --> 01:39:25,590
I don't like...

2175
01:39:25,590 --> 01:39:26,330
I don't know.

2176
01:39:28,230 --> 01:39:30,550
Not a fan of any of the other support skins.

2177
01:39:30,990 --> 01:39:31,210
Yeah.

2178
01:39:31,510 --> 01:39:32,650
I feel like the other...

2179
01:39:32,650 --> 01:39:37,730
Like, I feel like DPS and tanks have better skins than supports.

2180
01:39:38,190 --> 01:39:39,470
Like, none of them are good.

2181
01:39:41,110 --> 01:39:42,310
Bounty Hunter...

2182
01:39:42,310 --> 01:39:43,830
Rocket's not a...

2183
01:39:44,510 --> 01:39:45,110
Rocket...

2184
01:39:46,590 --> 01:39:47,690
If I...

2185
01:39:51,670 --> 01:39:54,870
How can I say this without getting my Twitch demonetized?

2186
01:40:02,950 --> 01:40:05,330
What can I say about Rocket?

2187
01:40:09,110 --> 01:40:10,550
You don't...

2188
01:40:10,550 --> 01:40:11,370
He's actually...

2189
01:40:11,370 --> 01:40:13,050
Okay, the worst part is that...

2190
01:40:13,050 --> 01:40:17,770
He's actually really, really good in the higher, higher ELO.

2191
01:40:18,450 --> 01:40:19,090
Like...

2192
01:40:20,830 --> 01:40:21,470
In...

2193
01:40:21,470 --> 01:40:22,050
Let's see.

2194
01:40:22,350 --> 01:40:24,390
In like, one above all lobbies now.

2195
01:40:24,610 --> 01:40:27,830
But like, people who got inflated...

2196
01:40:27,830 --> 01:40:31,050
Got inflated SR games with Rocket...

2197
01:40:31,610 --> 01:40:33,310
Do not play at that level.

2198
01:40:34,050 --> 01:40:35,130
They are not good.

2199
01:40:35,250 --> 01:40:36,870
They do not play at that level.

2200
01:40:37,510 --> 01:40:39,810
I feel like...

2201
01:40:39,810 --> 01:40:43,330
Rocket 1 tricks are not good at beating high, low...

2202
01:40:43,330 --> 01:40:44,630
High ELO Rocket players.

2203
01:40:44,870 --> 01:40:45,810
I've encountered...

2204
01:40:46,750 --> 01:40:47,950
Players who play...

2205
01:40:48,410 --> 01:40:51,950
Support mains who play Rocket really, really well.

2206
01:40:52,390 --> 01:40:57,070
But not Rocket 1 tricks who play Rocket really, really well.

2207
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:05,040
Like, I know like a couple of support players that can live on Rocket for so long.

2208
01:41:06,100 --> 01:41:09,140
Yeah, they just have game sense from playing other supports.

2209
01:41:09,140 --> 01:41:11,800
So like, that translates well into Rocket.

2210
01:41:13,380 --> 01:41:14,300
But like, I don't know.

2211
01:41:14,680 --> 01:41:16,140
We haven't killed each other yet.

2212
01:41:17,080 --> 01:41:17,640
Like...

2213
01:41:17,640 --> 01:41:18,500
What's wrong?

2214
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:21,020
How have I not found a dead king?

2215
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:24,080
How...

2216
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:25,500
How have like...

2217
01:41:25,500 --> 01:41:26,440
People with high...

2218
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:26,700
Ooh.

2219
01:41:29,100 --> 01:41:29,800
Let's go.

2220
01:41:29,860 --> 01:41:30,540
Oh shit, sorry.

2221
01:41:30,820 --> 01:41:32,020
I got spanked at, sorry.

2222
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:33,140
I couldn't help myself.

2223
01:41:33,680 --> 01:41:33,840
I...

2224
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:37,100
I couldn't...

2225
01:41:37,100 --> 01:41:38,660
I couldn't help myself.

2226
01:41:38,660 --> 01:41:39,540
Oh shit!

2227
01:41:39,720 --> 01:41:39,960
No!

2228
01:41:40,860 --> 01:41:42,340
He didn't want to share.

2229
01:41:47,480 --> 01:41:48,440
Holy shit.

2230
01:41:49,540 --> 01:41:50,360
Smacked that.

2231
01:41:50,520 --> 01:41:50,960
But...

2232
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:51,840
Oh, he's mine.

2233
01:41:51,960 --> 01:41:52,740
Oh shit, I'm sorry.

2234
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:53,200
I'm sorry.

2235
01:41:53,340 --> 01:41:53,960
I'm so sorry.

2236
01:41:54,520 --> 01:41:55,200
Oh, I'm...

2237
01:41:55,200 --> 01:41:55,960
Am I roleplaying?

2238
01:41:56,700 --> 01:41:57,960
I'm doing it, guys.

2239
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:58,760
I'm roleplaying.

2240
01:42:06,290 --> 01:42:07,530
I'm doing it.

2241
01:42:14,030 --> 01:42:14,510
Alright.

2242
01:42:14,850 --> 01:42:15,890
What lobby is this?

2243
01:42:15,930 --> 01:42:16,930
I mean, it's just low eternity.

2244
01:42:18,470 --> 01:42:21,350
Like I said, I feel like there's barely any west coast servers.

2245
01:42:21,570 --> 01:42:22,810
I think they like...

2246
01:42:22,810 --> 01:42:24,410
They put all the servers in east coast.

2247
01:42:27,430 --> 01:42:27,870
Oh.

2248
01:42:28,530 --> 01:42:29,930
Okay, I wanna play...

2249
01:42:30,730 --> 01:42:31,170
Hmm.

2250
01:42:37,650 --> 01:42:38,090
Alright,

2251
01:42:41,370 --> 01:42:42,390
I'm banning...

2252
01:42:44,030 --> 01:42:44,670
I wanna say, you know what?

2253
01:42:44,750 --> 01:42:45,170
Fuck Luna.

2254
01:42:45,250 --> 01:42:45,930
You know you're right.

2255
01:42:46,110 --> 01:42:46,630
Fuck Luna.

2256
01:42:46,710 --> 01:42:48,070
Today's a non-Luna day.

2257
01:42:48,950 --> 01:42:50,890
It's a non-Luna day today.

2258
01:42:52,050 --> 01:42:52,830
Oh, we're banning Luna.

2259
01:42:53,010 --> 01:42:53,650
We're banning...

2260
01:42:53,650 --> 01:42:54,210
Hmm.

2261
01:42:54,350 --> 01:42:54,510
Hello.

2262
01:42:54,730 --> 01:42:55,370
I'mma ban Groot.

2263
01:42:55,490 --> 01:42:56,710
We don't have a Groot player anyway.

2264
01:42:57,550 --> 01:42:58,030
Yay!

2265
01:42:58,150 --> 01:42:58,750
They banned Hello.

2266
01:43:02,530 --> 01:43:03,910
Alright, goodbye Groot.

2267
01:43:04,330 --> 01:43:04,710
Goodbye.

2268
01:43:08,810 --> 01:43:11,970
They have a low-key player, by the way, if we wanna ban him.

2269
01:43:14,550 --> 01:43:15,270
It's okay.

2270
01:43:15,390 --> 01:43:17,150
We have the low-key player.

2271
01:43:18,330 --> 01:43:19,470
Five star eight.

2272
01:43:23,210 --> 01:43:23,850
Nice.

2273
01:43:24,130 --> 01:43:24,550
Okay.

2274
01:43:25,330 --> 01:43:26,090
That's fine.

2275
01:43:29,610 --> 01:43:30,250
Alright.

2276
01:43:31,430 --> 01:43:32,570
I'mma play Seastorm.

2277
01:43:33,350 --> 01:43:34,550
For the thing anyway.

2278
01:43:35,830 --> 01:43:36,190
Yeah.

2279
01:43:36,510 --> 01:43:39,050
I put streamer mode on because I get tired of...

2280
01:43:40,910 --> 01:43:41,550
People...

2281
01:43:42,510 --> 01:43:43,550
I don't know.

2282
01:43:43,790 --> 01:43:45,190
People are weird.

2283
01:43:49,630 --> 01:43:50,590
People are weird.

2284
01:43:50,750 --> 01:43:51,990
So I just put streamer mode on.

2285
01:44:00,010 --> 01:44:01,490
Ah, buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh.

2286
01:44:02,790 --> 01:44:04,430
You're looking sound a bit tired.

2287
01:44:04,910 --> 01:44:06,010
I'mma play like...

2288
01:44:06,010 --> 01:44:06,890
I'mma say today's anime is short.

2289
01:44:06,970 --> 01:44:08,630
I wish I did start a stream earlier.

2290
01:44:08,910 --> 01:44:10,050
I just had a lot of work to do.

2291
01:44:10,110 --> 01:44:11,970
And I do have an early stream tomorrow too.

2292
01:44:12,490 --> 01:44:14,490
I'll stream at 1230 tomorrow.

2293
01:44:15,290 --> 01:44:17,690
I still wanted to stream a little bit of Rivals.

2294
01:44:18,110 --> 01:44:20,850
Because, you know, I do have like...

2295
01:44:20,850 --> 01:44:22,430
I don't wanna like...

2296
01:44:22,430 --> 01:44:25,030
I don't wanna like put too many...

2297
01:44:25,030 --> 01:44:28,290
Like, force myself to stream in big batches.

2298
01:44:30,670 --> 01:44:31,110
Uh...

2299
01:44:31,110 --> 01:44:34,850
In big batches before the deadline.

2300
01:44:35,030 --> 01:44:37,130
So I just... I can do like tiny batches too.

2301
01:44:39,510 --> 01:44:41,330
And our games have been going well.

2302
01:44:41,610 --> 01:44:42,050
How's this?

2303
01:44:42,090 --> 01:44:43,190
We play until we lose.

2304
01:44:43,930 --> 01:44:45,730
I'mma say that and then we lose this next game.

2305
01:44:49,510 --> 01:44:51,270
Hi, thank you for the super chat.

2306
01:44:51,390 --> 01:44:51,650
Thank you.

2307
01:44:52,110 --> 01:44:53,270
We're gonna be so...

2308
01:44:53,270 --> 01:44:54,890
Why are we so split up like that?

2309
01:44:54,890 --> 01:44:56,010
I just followed our match.

2310
01:44:59,010 --> 01:45:00,250
It was so funny.

2311
01:45:00,430 --> 01:45:01,010
And we like...

2312
01:45:01,570 --> 01:45:02,510
Lost right here.

2313
01:45:03,870 --> 01:45:07,390
Okay, we play until we lose two games.

2314
01:45:07,610 --> 01:45:08,950
Oh yeah, we're definitely...

2315
01:45:08,950 --> 01:45:10,750
We're definitely playing until we lose two games.

2316
01:45:13,350 --> 01:45:13,830
We're...

2317
01:45:20,070 --> 01:45:21,910
Yeah, I started thinking that.

2318
01:45:22,030 --> 01:45:23,050
And I was like, I'm very...

2319
01:45:23,050 --> 01:45:23,690
Very...

2320
01:45:27,110 --> 01:45:29,110
What time is it over there?

2321
01:45:29,230 --> 01:45:30,050
And you...

2322
01:45:31,150 --> 01:45:32,130
Dox yourself.

2323
01:45:32,390 --> 01:45:33,330
Cause I don't remember which...

2324
01:45:34,010 --> 01:45:34,950
Which EU.

2325
01:45:37,830 --> 01:45:38,730
It's like 10 AM.

2326
01:45:38,830 --> 01:45:42,550
Wait, why the fuck are you awake at 10?

2327
01:45:46,230 --> 01:45:47,830
What the fuck?

2328
01:45:51,140 --> 01:45:52,240
You have to study?

2329
01:45:52,740 --> 01:45:53,340
Aww.

2330
01:45:56,600 --> 01:45:57,120
Aww.

2331
01:45:57,460 --> 01:45:59,020
Why study when you can play Rivals?

2332
01:46:00,840 --> 01:46:01,880
Think about it.

2333
01:46:02,080 --> 01:46:03,480
Guys, I don't think we're winning this.

2334
01:46:04,540 --> 01:46:06,320
Guys, I don't think we're...

2335
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:07,520
Oh my...

2336
01:46:14,180 --> 01:46:15,220
It's fucking...

2337
01:46:15,980 --> 01:46:16,500
Okay.

2338
01:46:26,100 --> 01:46:26,620
Um...

2339
01:46:27,480 --> 01:46:28,000
Yeah.

2340
01:46:29,020 --> 01:46:30,680
If we fucked up, it would be like...

2341
01:46:30,680 --> 01:46:31,380
Oh shit, wait.

2342
01:46:35,500 --> 01:46:37,520
Oh shit, I couldn't...

2343
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:38,540
I did have push.

2344
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:40,060
I was just not paying attention.

2345
01:46:42,940 --> 01:46:43,680
There you go.

2346
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:44,720
But I did pull him!

2347
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:46,620
Look at that.

2348
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:48,640
It's okay.

2349
01:46:49,400 --> 01:46:50,320
There's still hope.

2350
01:46:51,240 --> 01:46:52,360
Control C!

2351
01:46:56,190 --> 01:46:57,670
Oh my god, Healers.

2352
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:04,480
Yeah, Healers.

2353
01:47:04,660 --> 01:47:06,580
A little bit of Rivals won't hurt you, right?

2354
01:47:07,740 --> 01:47:10,220
This account is a hundred and...

2355
01:47:11,800 --> 01:47:13,220
A hundred and...

2356
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:14,480
Twenty something?

2357
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:15,180
I think?

2358
01:47:15,580 --> 01:47:16,500
This is 120.

2359
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:21,160
Guys, there's like a guy over the top there.

2360
01:47:21,960 --> 01:47:23,060
Feeling fantastic.

2361
01:47:26,590 --> 01:47:27,150
Okay.

2362
01:47:28,090 --> 01:47:28,950
It's fine.

2363
01:47:29,830 --> 01:47:31,370
Come on, you...

2364
01:47:31,370 --> 01:47:34,070
It would be so fun to like...

2365
01:47:34,890 --> 01:47:38,110
You know, oh my god, just think about it.

2366
01:47:38,230 --> 01:47:39,410
Getting on Rivals.

2367
01:47:40,190 --> 01:47:43,430
Getting yelled at by like NA people because they talk too much.

2368
01:47:43,850 --> 01:47:45,910
Is that your favorite part of the day?

2369
01:47:48,670 --> 01:47:49,950
Wouldn't you wanna...

2370
01:47:49,950 --> 01:47:50,670
Come on!

2371
01:47:50,950 --> 01:47:52,090
You know you want it.

2372
01:47:54,350 --> 01:47:55,290
Come on!

2373
01:47:56,550 --> 01:47:58,150
Don't you wanna get yelled at?

2374
01:47:59,550 --> 01:48:00,470
By NA people?

2375
01:48:01,210 --> 01:48:02,470
Actually no, more like...

2376
01:48:02,470 --> 01:48:03,670
Actually I can tell.

2377
01:48:03,730 --> 01:48:04,710
I don't know who yells more.

2378
01:48:04,890 --> 01:48:05,710
EU or NA.

2379
01:48:06,310 --> 01:48:08,390
NA people just talk a lot.

2380
01:48:09,470 --> 01:48:11,130
NA people just talk a lot.

2381
01:48:11,210 --> 01:48:13,690
EU people will wait until you fuck up and then...

2382
01:48:13,690 --> 01:48:15,830
And then just like tell you...

2383
01:48:15,830 --> 01:48:16,830
Say I'll fuck your mom.

2384
01:48:17,150 --> 01:48:17,770
Or some shit.

2385
01:48:19,590 --> 01:48:22,130
Or say your mom is disappointed in you.

2386
01:48:22,130 --> 01:48:24,390
They talk less talk.

2387
01:48:24,990 --> 01:48:27,470
Don't wait until you fuck up.

2388
01:48:28,450 --> 01:48:29,050
Okay.

2389
01:48:30,610 --> 01:48:32,350
Yeah, EU is saying rage.

2390
01:48:32,470 --> 01:48:33,130
No, I agree.

2391
01:48:36,470 --> 01:48:37,630
Oh shit.

2392
01:48:38,410 --> 01:48:39,270
Oh that's bad.

2393
01:48:39,930 --> 01:48:40,730
Do we have rez?

2394
01:48:40,930 --> 01:48:41,490
We do.

2395
01:48:45,350 --> 01:48:47,210
NA people love to talk.

2396
01:48:48,710 --> 01:48:49,950
It's like our thing.

2397
01:48:50,570 --> 01:48:52,090
Even if it's like...

2398
01:48:54,410 --> 01:48:55,430
Oh no!

2399
01:49:03,230 --> 01:49:06,250
And then the stage walked up to me!

2400
01:49:06,750 --> 01:49:08,310
I'm so fucked up!

2401
01:49:08,930 --> 01:49:11,990
I actually did a game winning play!

2402
01:49:15,250 --> 01:49:16,410
Oh my god.

2403
01:49:17,050 --> 01:49:18,250
The world hates me.

2404
01:49:19,290 --> 01:49:21,230
This is my villain arc right here.

2405
01:49:22,030 --> 01:49:22,910
Okay, don't worry.

2406
01:49:23,410 --> 01:49:24,870
They can't hurt you now.

2407
01:49:32,390 --> 01:49:33,830
Oh my god!

2408
01:49:33,830 --> 01:49:34,890
First stage!

2409
01:49:35,330 --> 01:49:35,770
Yes!

2410
01:49:36,170 --> 01:49:36,990
I don't...

2411
01:49:36,990 --> 01:49:40,310
I don't think we're winning this one.

2412
01:49:41,930 --> 01:49:43,730
I'm first stage!

2413
01:49:43,910 --> 01:49:44,330
He won!

2414
01:49:45,010 --> 01:49:46,410
He got...

2415
01:49:46,410 --> 01:49:48,450
He got Kalooge.

2416
01:49:49,050 --> 01:49:49,890
He got Kalooge.

2417
01:49:49,890 --> 01:49:51,550
I just gave up after this.

2418
01:49:51,690 --> 01:49:52,750
You're not gonna try and re...

2419
01:49:52,750 --> 01:49:53,130
What?

2420
01:49:54,650 --> 01:49:55,990
Oh my god.

2421
01:49:56,150 --> 01:49:57,230
Oh my god.

2422
01:50:00,410 --> 01:50:02,030
We got our first stage!

2423
01:50:02,030 --> 01:50:02,810
What are we doing?

2424
01:50:03,050 --> 01:50:04,370
Why are we falling for that?

2425
01:50:06,290 --> 01:50:08,390
I guess we were right at his feet, so...

2426
01:50:09,290 --> 01:50:10,950
Ranged is gonna die, but like...

2427
01:50:10,950 --> 01:50:11,970
We got kidnapped!

2428
01:50:13,790 --> 01:50:15,390
You have to put it at exact...

2429
01:50:16,170 --> 01:50:16,590
Oh my god.

2430
01:50:16,670 --> 01:50:19,270
He even jumped on it too, because you can't...

2431
01:50:19,270 --> 01:50:19,710
Okay.

2432
01:50:20,950 --> 01:50:22,590
Okay, I might go...

2433
01:50:22,590 --> 01:50:23,390
Oh my god.

2434
01:50:23,890 --> 01:50:24,490
I don't know.

2435
01:50:24,490 --> 01:50:27,210
I wanna go lowkey, because...

2436
01:50:27,210 --> 01:50:29,710
I don't know we have enough heals right now.

2437
01:50:30,030 --> 01:50:30,930
I don't...

2438
01:50:31,370 --> 01:50:34,390
Like, I don't understand why you would jump through that, man.

2439
01:50:35,650 --> 01:50:36,690
Makes no sense.

2440
01:50:37,350 --> 01:50:38,030
We got this.

2441
01:50:42,290 --> 01:50:42,770
Damn.

2442
01:50:43,550 --> 01:50:44,170
You hear that?

2443
01:50:44,230 --> 01:50:44,990
We got this.

2444
01:50:48,670 --> 01:50:49,630
That's crazy.

2445
01:50:50,530 --> 01:50:53,710
Alright, if we lose this, we get one more loss before...

2446
01:50:54,930 --> 01:50:56,650
Before things go out of hand.

2447
01:50:58,170 --> 01:50:58,970
Yeah, he did.

2448
01:50:59,070 --> 01:50:59,550
That was crazy.

2449
01:51:00,250 --> 01:51:01,690
Seeing him jump through this.

2450
01:51:03,090 --> 01:51:03,970
Is it Visor or somebody?

2451
01:51:04,330 --> 01:51:04,930
I don't remember.

2452
01:51:06,110 --> 01:51:07,150
That name is familiar.

2453
01:51:08,030 --> 01:51:09,550
Or maybe I just play too much.

2454
01:51:10,130 --> 01:51:12,170
And everybody's familiar at this time.

2455
01:51:16,010 --> 01:51:17,290
At least they're confident.

2456
01:51:20,070 --> 01:51:21,570
Can we just make this and go at them?

2457
01:51:21,630 --> 01:51:22,550
I don't think they have any...

2458
01:51:22,550 --> 01:51:23,470
Oh, please!

2459
01:51:25,890 --> 01:51:26,570
Okay.

2460
01:51:30,630 --> 01:51:34,010
I don't know, but...

2461
01:51:36,610 --> 01:51:39,890
I guess we don't go at them.

2462
01:51:48,750 --> 01:51:50,650
I think it was Karma.

2463
01:51:51,590 --> 01:51:53,870
I think it may or may not be Karma.

2464
01:51:55,710 --> 01:51:56,710
Is he in Nightmare?

2465
01:51:56,890 --> 01:51:57,890
Yeah, I think so, right?

2466
01:51:59,370 --> 01:52:00,610
That name is familiar.

2467
01:52:01,590 --> 01:52:02,330
How is he...

2468
01:52:02,330 --> 01:52:04,330
Wait, how did he drop down here?

2469
01:52:06,090 --> 01:52:07,990
Does that mean...

2470
01:52:08,610 --> 01:52:10,770
Everybody has bad days, guys.

2471
01:52:11,370 --> 01:52:13,050
It happens to all of us.

2472
01:52:13,290 --> 01:52:14,230
Okay, thank god.

2473
01:52:14,250 --> 01:52:15,550
Okay, I was gonna be like...

2474
01:52:15,550 --> 01:52:17,430
Is that his main or is it just Visor?

2475
01:52:17,510 --> 01:52:18,130
I don't remember.

2476
01:52:19,150 --> 01:52:20,670
I don't remember if his main was...

2477
01:52:21,210 --> 01:52:21,610
Woah!

2478
01:52:25,070 --> 01:52:27,290
Don't worry, he's not gonna gen us, right?

2479
01:52:29,670 --> 01:52:30,630
Oh, nevermind.

2480
01:52:34,550 --> 01:52:35,470
Okay, let's go.

2481
01:52:35,610 --> 01:52:36,030
Let's save...

2482
01:52:36,030 --> 01:52:37,330
Oh, no, Loki!

2483
01:52:38,950 --> 01:52:40,030
Loki, no!

2484
01:52:40,310 --> 01:52:41,970
I wanted to save you!

2485
01:52:43,170 --> 01:52:43,990
It's fine.

2486
01:52:44,210 --> 01:52:45,030
It's not fine.

2487
01:52:45,370 --> 01:52:46,150
It's fine.

2488
01:52:46,530 --> 01:52:47,130
We're so back.

2489
01:52:48,110 --> 01:52:48,970
We're so back.

2490
01:52:50,850 --> 01:52:51,430
We're still...

2491
01:52:51,430 --> 01:52:53,390
I have to reload, but we're still so back.

2492
01:52:53,570 --> 01:52:54,490
We're so back.

2493
01:52:57,090 --> 01:52:59,310
We're so healthy.

2494
01:53:01,790 --> 01:53:02,710
It's okay.

2495
01:53:04,810 --> 01:53:07,600
I'm healing so much through everything.

2496
01:53:08,730 --> 01:53:10,570
At least we're stabilized, right?

2497
01:53:11,150 --> 01:53:11,610
Feeling good!

2498
01:53:15,030 --> 01:53:17,750
Nice, okay.

2499
01:53:18,430 --> 01:53:20,310
Woah, okay, goodbye prison rules.

2500
01:53:22,450 --> 01:53:24,350
Clearly prison didn't help him.

2501
01:53:26,370 --> 01:53:28,430
Goodbye, into the pit you go.

2502
01:53:28,870 --> 01:53:29,490
No!

2503
01:53:36,590 --> 01:53:38,810
I thought that was so cool.

2504
01:53:39,270 --> 01:53:40,570
Don't worry, I'll put you back in that pit.

2505
01:53:40,910 --> 01:53:41,570
I'll put you back.

2506
01:53:42,430 --> 01:53:43,550
He bubbled.

2507
01:53:45,990 --> 01:53:46,950
That's unlucky.

2508
01:53:47,370 --> 01:53:48,750
We're gonna lose this.

2509
01:53:49,390 --> 01:53:50,010
100%.

2510
01:53:53,010 --> 01:53:54,550
I don't know.

2511
01:53:54,550 --> 01:53:55,970
I don't know.

2512
01:53:56,110 --> 01:53:57,650
I don't feel very confident.

2513
01:54:00,310 --> 01:54:01,290
I don't know.

2514
01:54:04,530 --> 01:54:07,310
I don't feel very confident right now.

2515
01:54:07,530 --> 01:54:08,870
I'll put it right here.

2516
01:54:10,110 --> 01:54:10,910
Yeah, that's...

2517
01:54:10,910 --> 01:54:12,210
I need to figure out...

2518
01:54:12,210 --> 01:54:13,290
I need to push that better.

2519
01:54:15,010 --> 01:54:15,710
I need to like...

2520
01:54:16,510 --> 01:54:18,450
Jesus Christ, like where is he?

2521
01:54:19,910 --> 01:54:21,010
Oh my god!

2522
01:54:26,410 --> 01:54:27,490
How did I get double...

2523
01:54:30,170 --> 01:54:31,950
Did they double two?

2524
01:54:34,130 --> 01:54:36,330
They like double sued us!

2525
01:54:39,550 --> 01:54:41,550
Oh my god.

2526
01:54:43,290 --> 01:54:45,150
I got double pushed out.

2527
01:54:47,570 --> 01:54:48,630
Oh my...

2528
01:54:48,630 --> 01:54:49,630
I was like...

2529
01:54:49,630 --> 01:54:50,510
I was like...

2530
01:54:50,510 --> 01:54:52,110
Get me back in here!

2531
01:54:53,430 --> 01:54:54,790
Oh no.

2532
01:54:56,310 --> 01:54:57,450
No, that's karma.

2533
01:54:59,470 --> 01:55:01,010
That's karma right there.

2534
01:55:07,370 --> 01:55:09,470
I deserved it.

2535
01:55:09,810 --> 01:55:10,750
I deserved it.

2536
01:55:10,810 --> 01:55:12,050
I showed his record.

2537
01:55:12,850 --> 01:55:21,850
I showed it to the whole world to see.

2538
01:55:22,710 --> 01:55:25,250
I showed it.

2539
01:55:30,750 --> 01:55:31,210
Alright.

2540
01:55:31,790 --> 01:55:32,250
Alright.

2541
01:55:32,510 --> 01:55:34,110
Wait, have you been watching again?

2542
01:55:40,410 --> 01:55:40,870
Okay.

2543
01:55:55,190 --> 01:55:56,010
We saw...

2544
01:55:56,010 --> 01:55:56,750
We saw the...

2545
01:55:56,750 --> 01:55:57,390
What do you mean?

2546
01:55:57,630 --> 01:55:58,390
Oh shit!

2547
01:55:58,650 --> 01:55:59,790
Yum yum yum yum yum yum yum.

2548
01:56:00,050 --> 01:56:01,090
I need a fish break.

2549
01:56:01,510 --> 01:56:03,590
Yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum.

2550
01:56:12,690 --> 01:56:15,190
I'm in a fish break.

2551
01:56:15,370 --> 01:56:16,130
Yum yum yum.

2552
01:56:16,910 --> 01:56:17,210
Alright.

2553
01:56:17,410 --> 01:56:18,290
It's a winning stock.

2554
01:56:18,490 --> 01:56:19,250
We're going in.

2555
01:56:21,930 --> 01:56:23,610
Wait, why was the queue canceled?

2556
01:56:23,950 --> 01:56:25,030
Oh my god!

2557
01:56:39,610 --> 01:56:41,870
Wait, do you want to join Discord real quick?

2558
01:56:42,330 --> 01:56:42,510
What?

2559
01:56:42,630 --> 01:56:43,050
I thought you need pizza.

2560
01:56:43,330 --> 01:56:43,750
Why?

2561
01:56:43,750 --> 01:56:44,370
Wait.

2562
01:56:44,470 --> 01:56:45,490
I don't have...

2563
01:56:46,410 --> 01:56:47,550
Wait, I don't have push to talk.

2564
01:56:47,730 --> 01:56:48,470
Do I have push to talk?

2565
01:56:48,590 --> 01:56:50,710
Wait, they're talking to us in-game.

2566
01:56:57,310 --> 01:56:59,130
I can talk in-game.

2567
01:56:59,310 --> 01:57:02,030
I can talk in-game.

2568
01:57:02,170 --> 01:57:04,870
The rest of the team is like...

2569
01:57:04,870 --> 01:57:06,290
The rest of the team is just like...

2570
01:57:06,290 --> 01:57:07,990
What the fuck are they talking about?

2571
01:57:10,970 --> 01:57:11,950
Okay, I banned Hella.

2572
01:57:12,730 --> 01:57:13,050
Right?

2573
01:57:13,230 --> 01:57:14,210
Thank you Twitch Prime.

2574
01:57:14,310 --> 01:57:15,490
Thank you, thank you.

2575
01:57:16,870 --> 01:57:17,810
And I become a cat.

2576
01:57:17,910 --> 01:57:18,490
April Fool.

2577
01:57:18,590 --> 01:57:19,330
I just...

2578
01:57:19,330 --> 01:57:20,090
I killed her.

2579
01:57:20,890 --> 01:57:22,410
It's DoeKitty's channel now.

2580
01:57:24,090 --> 01:57:26,530
You know what they say about cats and birds.

2581
01:57:31,890 --> 01:57:32,870
It's time.

2582
01:57:34,470 --> 01:57:36,870
Discord or no Discord.

2583
01:57:37,750 --> 01:57:38,650
We can...

2584
01:57:38,650 --> 01:57:39,250
We're here.

2585
01:57:40,310 --> 01:57:42,130
We can talk in-game.

2586
01:57:42,350 --> 01:57:43,390
Let me bind...

2587
01:57:44,910 --> 01:57:46,030
My mic.

2588
01:57:51,090 --> 01:57:54,110
The rest of the team is like...

2589
01:57:54,110 --> 01:57:55,370
It's like...

2590
01:57:55,370 --> 01:57:57,110
What the fuck is going on?

2591
01:57:58,930 --> 01:58:00,110
Oh, they banned Luna.

2592
01:58:00,190 --> 01:58:00,710
That's fine.

2593
01:58:01,670 --> 01:58:02,730
It's Loki time.

2594
01:58:03,470 --> 01:58:04,150
Who do I copy?

2595
01:58:04,390 --> 01:58:04,610
Okay.

2596
01:58:05,190 --> 01:58:06,250
Okay, never...

2597
01:58:07,090 --> 01:58:08,170
I was gonna say like...

2598
01:58:08,170 --> 01:58:09,130
Who do I copy?

2599
01:58:09,130 --> 01:58:10,730
I guess none of them.

2600
01:58:11,270 --> 01:58:11,810
Alright.

2601
01:58:12,130 --> 01:58:12,970
Let's see.

2602
01:58:15,450 --> 01:58:17,030
In-game voice volume.

2603
01:58:17,390 --> 01:58:18,370
Push to talk.

2604
01:58:18,830 --> 01:58:20,250
Voice chat mic.

2605
01:58:24,190 --> 01:58:24,730
Communication.

2606
01:58:25,970 --> 01:58:26,610
Oh, I have it on.

2607
01:58:26,750 --> 01:58:27,310
Okay, nice.

2608
01:58:28,410 --> 01:58:28,930
Nice.

2609
01:58:29,190 --> 01:58:29,990
I just copied...

2610
01:58:29,990 --> 01:58:30,610
Oh, you're right.

2611
01:58:32,210 --> 01:58:33,550
What would be better than one rocket?

2612
01:58:33,770 --> 01:58:34,300
Two rockets.

2613
01:58:34,300 --> 01:58:34,800
Two rockets.

2614
01:58:37,200 --> 01:58:39,060
Keep the loot streak going.

2615
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:49,320
Alright, let's go.

2616
01:58:49,820 --> 01:58:50,840
Yeah, oh my god.

2617
01:58:50,960 --> 01:58:51,460
Double...

2618
01:58:51,460 --> 01:58:52,060
Imagine.

2619
01:58:52,360 --> 01:58:53,040
Double ampli...

2620
01:58:53,040 --> 01:58:53,900
Oh my god, I should do that.

2621
01:58:54,020 --> 01:58:55,480
Okay, when I die, I'm gonna play Loki.

2622
01:58:55,840 --> 01:58:59,040
And then we're gonna double amplify and then I'll swap back to Sue.

2623
01:59:00,760 --> 01:59:01,760
I get one.

2624
01:59:02,760 --> 01:59:03,760
I get one.

2625
01:59:08,020 --> 01:59:09,460
This mic is so quiet.

2626
01:59:11,220 --> 01:59:12,200
Yeah, no, they stack.

2627
01:59:12,300 --> 01:59:12,780
No, they do.

2628
01:59:13,220 --> 01:59:13,840
Wait, they don't?

2629
01:59:14,220 --> 01:59:15,140
I was lied to!

2630
01:59:15,300 --> 01:59:16,240
I thought they stack!

2631
01:59:18,100 --> 01:59:20,340
Oh my god, what's the point if they don't stack?

2632
01:59:21,340 --> 01:59:22,200
What's the point?

2633
01:59:22,960 --> 01:59:24,300
That was my whole mission.

2634
01:59:25,420 --> 01:59:26,460
I can't believe it.

2635
01:59:26,480 --> 01:59:27,480
I got lied to.

2636
01:59:27,640 --> 01:59:28,820
I thought they stack.

2637
01:59:31,920 --> 01:59:32,940
What do I do?

2638
01:59:33,900 --> 01:59:36,580
Now that I know it doesn't stack, like, what do I do?

2639
01:59:36,580 --> 01:59:37,640
My life is over.

2640
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:41,780
I feel like I have to be here.

2641
01:59:42,880 --> 01:59:44,340
I have to actually, like, frontline.

2642
01:59:44,960 --> 01:59:46,320
It's okay, our Loki can heal.

2643
01:59:47,660 --> 01:59:48,860
I'll just heal here.

2644
01:59:50,760 --> 01:59:51,780
Are they okay?

2645
01:59:53,280 --> 01:59:54,220
They're okay.

2646
01:59:55,980 --> 01:59:57,160
They'll be fine.

2647
01:59:58,560 --> 01:59:59,800
They're so healthy!

2648
02:00:01,680 --> 02:00:03,400
My team's dead in the front.

2649
02:00:03,920 --> 02:00:04,200
Whoops.

2650
02:00:06,580 --> 02:00:07,860
They're so healthy still.

2651
02:00:08,040 --> 02:00:08,620
I believe.

2652
02:00:09,480 --> 02:00:10,120
What?

2653
02:00:10,960 --> 02:00:11,940
Hey guys.

2654
02:00:13,900 --> 02:00:15,180
I wish...

2655
02:00:15,180 --> 02:00:17,340
I wish I had...

2656
02:00:17,340 --> 02:00:17,980
I don't know.

2657
02:00:19,300 --> 02:00:22,260
I wish I had, like, uh...

2658
02:00:22,260 --> 02:00:23,740
Oh wait, wait, we can...

2659
02:00:24,400 --> 02:00:25,460
He's so healthy.

2660
02:00:25,680 --> 02:00:26,760
He's so... he's dead.

2661
02:00:27,260 --> 02:00:28,340
But he'll be healthy.

2662
02:00:28,960 --> 02:00:29,540
I believe.

2663
02:00:30,480 --> 02:00:31,460
I believe.

2664
02:00:32,640 --> 02:00:33,900
I still believe.

2665
02:00:36,100 --> 02:00:37,260
Look, I got scared.

2666
02:00:40,880 --> 02:00:44,620
Look, we did it.

2667
02:00:45,780 --> 02:00:47,180
We did it, guys.

2668
02:00:48,280 --> 02:00:49,180
We did it.

2669
02:00:49,200 --> 02:00:49,940
We're so healthy.

2670
02:00:52,140 --> 02:00:55,520
Okay, I ulted first, so, like, it's our rocket's fault.

2671
02:00:56,280 --> 02:00:57,740
I threw that ult first.

2672
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:04,520
Alright.

2673
02:01:04,520 --> 02:01:04,700
Alright.

2674
02:01:07,650 --> 02:01:09,010
I did it.

2675
02:01:16,640 --> 02:01:18,240
I fucking did it, guys.

2676
02:01:19,860 --> 02:01:20,700
I'm a hero.

2677
02:01:22,680 --> 02:01:23,480
Will I die?

2678
02:01:23,740 --> 02:01:24,100
No.

2679
02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:25,480
I wouldn't.

2680
02:01:26,100 --> 02:01:27,220
I'm gaming.

2681
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:30,180
Okay, I...

2682
02:01:30,180 --> 02:01:31,280
am a little worried.

2683
02:01:33,300 --> 02:01:34,140
Hmm...

2684
02:01:35,580 --> 02:01:36,420
Hmm...

2685
02:01:37,720 --> 02:01:39,960
Maybe I should've...

2686
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:41,800
Eh...

2687
02:01:41,800 --> 02:01:43,540
Oh shit!

2688
02:01:43,860 --> 02:01:45,860
Oh my god!

2689
02:01:48,430 --> 02:01:49,230
What?!

2690
02:01:49,230 --> 02:01:49,950
Oh shit!

2691
02:01:50,530 --> 02:01:51,650
Oh no!

2692
02:01:52,170 --> 02:01:53,170
Oh no!

2693
02:01:55,070 --> 02:01:56,610
That was so...

2694
02:01:56,610 --> 02:01:57,930
Oh my god!

2695
02:01:58,450 --> 02:02:01,350
He just shot general direction and it got me!

2696
02:02:03,150 --> 02:02:04,950
Okay, but what if I go low-key?

2697
02:02:06,030 --> 02:02:06,670
You know what?

2698
02:02:07,090 --> 02:02:07,850
No, I should...

2699
02:02:08,850 --> 02:02:09,650
No...

2700
02:02:10,630 --> 02:02:10,990
Yes.

2701
02:02:14,310 --> 02:02:15,390
Let's do it.

2702
02:02:17,790 --> 02:02:19,050
I was like, no!

2703
02:02:19,730 --> 02:02:20,490
But yes!

2704
02:02:21,410 --> 02:02:21,930
No!

2705
02:02:22,950 --> 02:02:23,310
Alright.

2706
02:02:25,530 --> 02:02:26,650
And then I copy...

2707
02:02:30,410 --> 02:02:31,530
I fucked up.

2708
02:02:36,150 --> 02:02:38,790
I might've fucked up a little bit.

2709
02:02:39,610 --> 02:02:41,690
Because I'm supposed to be on high ground.

2710
02:02:41,830 --> 02:02:43,790
But I'm like stuck down here.

2711
02:02:46,750 --> 02:02:50,410
I'm supposed to be on high ground but I'm still down here.

2712
02:02:51,130 --> 02:02:51,990
Don't worry.

2713
02:02:53,030 --> 02:02:53,830
Don't worry.

2714
02:02:55,130 --> 02:02:56,950
Everybody is so healthy.

2715
02:02:57,090 --> 02:02:57,630
Oh my god!

2716
02:02:57,670 --> 02:02:59,410
You know what would be better than one amplifier?

2717
02:03:00,230 --> 02:03:01,170
Watch this.

2718
02:03:11,470 --> 02:03:12,290
Oh my god!

2719
02:03:12,370 --> 02:03:12,790
Double rez!

2720
02:03:14,190 --> 02:03:15,070
Oh my god!

2721
02:03:15,530 --> 02:03:16,290
This is it.

2722
02:03:19,030 --> 02:03:19,870
Please!

2723
02:03:20,190 --> 02:03:21,730
Oh my god!

2724
02:03:22,470 --> 02:03:24,750
Okay, I might've threw there.

2725
02:03:32,280 --> 02:03:34,900
Okay, we won't do that again.

2726
02:03:35,840 --> 02:03:36,260
Alright.

2727
02:03:37,680 --> 02:03:38,500
Alright guys.

2728
02:03:40,140 --> 02:03:42,940
I realized that like...

2729
02:03:42,940 --> 02:03:48,720
Maybe copying a rocket was not it.

2730
02:03:48,980 --> 02:03:49,520
Guys!

2731
02:03:49,820 --> 02:03:51,680
I'm not trolling, guys.

2732
02:03:51,960 --> 02:03:53,240
I was just...

2733
02:03:53,240 --> 02:03:54,900
I was experimenting.

2734
02:03:56,360 --> 02:03:56,760
There we go.

2735
02:03:58,160 --> 02:03:58,700
What?

2736
02:04:01,180 --> 02:04:03,820
I was just experimenting.

2737
02:04:04,660 --> 02:04:05,980
I was theorycrafting, okay?

2738
02:04:06,840 --> 02:04:08,480
Oh, that is unfair.

2739
02:04:08,500 --> 02:04:08,960
Unlucky.

2740
02:04:09,520 --> 02:04:11,460
That is actually so unlucky.

2741
02:04:14,600 --> 02:04:16,540
That is very unlucky.

2742
02:04:17,240 --> 02:04:17,920
Alright.

2743
02:04:19,700 --> 02:04:21,480
Loki's not it, guys.

2744
02:04:24,740 --> 02:04:25,880
Go back.

2745
02:04:26,400 --> 02:04:27,620
Alright, I'm done trolling.

2746
02:04:28,160 --> 02:04:29,520
I'm done trolling.

2747
02:04:31,160 --> 02:04:32,840
I'm done trolling, guys.

2748
02:04:35,440 --> 02:04:36,340
Guys, look.

2749
02:04:36,360 --> 02:04:36,940
I'm playing the game.

2750
02:04:37,880 --> 02:04:38,400
Look.

2751
02:04:41,780 --> 02:04:42,740
Okay, nice.

2752
02:04:44,540 --> 02:04:45,360
It's fine.

2753
02:04:46,240 --> 02:04:46,760
Look at that.

2754
02:04:47,380 --> 02:04:48,420
I'm doing it.

2755
02:04:50,820 --> 02:04:52,040
I'm doing it, guys.

2756
02:04:52,620 --> 02:04:53,700
They're so healthy.

2757
02:04:55,820 --> 02:04:58,160
Okay, I don't know what to do for these guys though.

2758
02:04:58,880 --> 02:04:59,700
Nice, okay.

2759
02:05:03,280 --> 02:05:03,800
Wow.

2760
02:05:04,020 --> 02:05:04,940
Wait, the game got easier.

2761
02:05:09,300 --> 02:05:09,860
Wait.

2762
02:05:10,340 --> 02:05:11,300
Wait a minute.

2763
02:05:12,540 --> 02:05:14,000
The game got a little bit easier.

2764
02:05:14,760 --> 02:05:15,680
Don't worry.

2765
02:05:16,040 --> 02:05:16,820
I'm a hero.

2766
02:05:18,740 --> 02:05:20,060
We all live.

2767
02:05:25,990 --> 02:05:26,530
I'm okay.

2768
02:05:30,700 --> 02:05:31,260
It's okay.

2769
02:05:31,320 --> 02:05:32,500
I'll just stay around here.

2770
02:05:33,640 --> 02:05:35,440
I'll just stay on my orb.

2771
02:05:38,960 --> 02:05:40,080
Jesus Christ.

2772
02:05:40,280 --> 02:05:41,660
What's going on down there?

2773
02:05:41,660 --> 02:05:42,960
Oh, shit!

2774
02:05:43,900 --> 02:05:47,200
Wait, this game actually got easier when I'm not on Loki.

2775
02:05:50,160 --> 02:05:50,580
Alright.

2776
02:05:51,060 --> 02:05:53,960
Look, we needed a little bit of spice in there, okay?

2777
02:05:55,300 --> 02:05:58,100
The game would've been too easy if I didn't...

2778
02:05:58,560 --> 02:06:00,680
If I didn't go Loki for one game.

2779
02:06:01,260 --> 02:06:02,940
For one time.

2780
02:06:04,100 --> 02:06:05,120
Who is that?

2781
02:06:05,300 --> 02:06:06,940
Games get easier when you're fucking around.

2782
02:06:08,140 --> 02:06:08,900
Who would've thought?

2783
02:06:12,940 --> 02:06:13,540
Yeah.

2784
02:06:16,600 --> 02:06:17,800
We could...

2785
02:06:17,800 --> 02:06:19,860
Or, Loki, I don't know.

2786
02:06:20,300 --> 02:06:22,820
You could try to do double amplify again.

2787
02:06:23,340 --> 02:06:24,460
It could be different.

2788
02:06:31,110 --> 02:06:33,090
Oh my god, double fantastical.

2789
02:06:33,650 --> 02:06:34,250
Imagine.

2790
02:06:34,750 --> 02:06:35,910
Oh my god, you're so...

2791
02:06:35,910 --> 02:06:36,770
You're so...

2792
02:06:36,770 --> 02:06:37,190
Wait.

2793
02:06:37,590 --> 02:06:38,530
Wait a minute.

2794
02:06:39,030 --> 02:06:40,270
Wait, we could do that.

2795
02:06:44,750 --> 02:06:45,650
They won't know.

2796
02:06:45,790 --> 02:06:46,790
That's the best part.

2797
02:06:47,850 --> 02:06:48,550
They won't know.

2798
02:06:49,270 --> 02:06:51,010
It could be better on attackers.

2799
02:06:52,050 --> 02:06:53,010
Double fantastical.

2800
02:06:53,170 --> 02:06:53,490
Let's go.

2801
02:06:53,570 --> 02:06:54,270
If we lose...

2802
02:06:57,410 --> 02:06:59,450
None of us are on our mains.

2803
02:06:59,570 --> 02:07:00,330
It's fine.

2804
02:07:00,810 --> 02:07:02,810
Literally, none of us are on our mains.

2805
02:07:02,950 --> 02:07:03,450
It's okay.

2806
02:07:04,270 --> 02:07:05,250
They won't know.

2807
02:07:06,810 --> 02:07:07,770
Double the bounce.

2808
02:07:07,890 --> 02:07:09,350
Oh my god, you're so right.

2809
02:07:09,490 --> 02:07:10,450
Double the bounce.

2810
02:07:16,250 --> 02:07:16,750
It's okay.

2811
02:07:16,810 --> 02:07:17,670
They don't know that.

2812
02:07:17,910 --> 02:07:19,170
No, I'm pretty sure they all...

2813
02:07:19,170 --> 02:07:19,970
Maybe they're all...

2814
02:07:19,970 --> 02:07:21,710
Maybe we're all on our ult accounts, guys.

2815
02:07:21,970 --> 02:07:23,970
We could all be on our ult accounts.

2816
02:07:24,890 --> 02:07:25,490
Double the bounce.

2817
02:07:25,590 --> 02:07:26,210
Double the fun.

2818
02:07:29,510 --> 02:07:29,750
Okay.

2819
02:07:30,950 --> 02:07:31,750
Okay, but...

2820
02:07:31,750 --> 02:07:33,070
Rocket players don't have rates.

2821
02:07:33,230 --> 02:07:34,250
So, like, I don't need...

2822
02:07:34,250 --> 02:07:34,730
It's...

2823
02:07:34,730 --> 02:07:36,650
We just need to care about the two other players.

2824
02:07:37,370 --> 02:07:38,390
In our game.

2825
02:07:41,250 --> 02:07:44,190
I just need to know what the two other players think.

2826
02:07:49,110 --> 02:07:50,010
It's fine.

2827
02:07:55,400 --> 02:07:56,240
It's fine.

2828
02:07:56,320 --> 02:07:56,800
I don't really...

2829
02:07:56,800 --> 02:07:58,060
I'm not even looking back.

2830
02:07:58,140 --> 02:07:59,200
I don't know if you noticed that.

2831
02:08:00,320 --> 02:08:01,520
Not even...

2832
02:08:01,520 --> 02:08:03,400
I'm not looking behind me.

2833
02:08:04,100 --> 02:08:07,180
About whatever the fucking Sarlord was trying to do.

2834
02:08:07,620 --> 02:08:08,180
Oh, is he...

2835
02:08:08,180 --> 02:08:10,200
Wait, he tried to shoot the clone!

2836
02:08:11,320 --> 02:08:12,340
That's cute.

2837
02:08:14,600 --> 02:08:16,220
What's wrong with playing Rocket?

2838
02:08:16,580 --> 02:08:17,080
Everything.

2839
02:08:21,160 --> 02:08:22,280
Okay, nice.

2840
02:08:23,980 --> 02:08:25,080
Double the bounce.

2841
02:08:25,240 --> 02:08:26,240
Double the fun.

2842
02:08:28,440 --> 02:08:29,480
Alright, I almost have it.

2843
02:08:29,940 --> 02:08:33,060
Guys, please don't...

2844
02:08:33,060 --> 02:08:33,800
Okay, here.

2845
02:08:35,380 --> 02:08:36,980
They're gonna get over here, right?

2846
02:08:37,480 --> 02:08:38,940
I don't have Envron right now.

2847
02:08:38,960 --> 02:08:39,660
I wasted that.

2848
02:08:40,200 --> 02:08:41,400
But they don't know that.

2849
02:08:42,640 --> 02:08:44,760
You can say that I was being a hero right now.

2850
02:08:44,900 --> 02:08:46,040
Oh, I almost have it, guys!

2851
02:08:48,200 --> 02:08:49,400
I almost have it!

2852
02:08:51,240 --> 02:08:53,180
Oh my god, it's almost time.

2853
02:08:53,820 --> 02:08:55,300
It's almost time.

2854
02:08:57,340 --> 02:08:59,240
Oh my god, it's almost time.

2855
02:08:59,300 --> 02:09:00,000
I'm heading over.

2856
02:09:01,640 --> 02:09:02,600
I'm heading over.

2857
02:09:02,700 --> 02:09:03,820
I'm ready to copy him.

2858
02:09:07,220 --> 02:09:08,260
I'm ready.

2859
02:09:10,380 --> 02:09:11,260
Get over...

2860
02:09:11,260 --> 02:09:11,600
No!

2861
02:09:13,420 --> 02:09:14,060
No!

2862
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:21,280
My bounce!

2863
02:09:22,220 --> 02:09:25,220
I couldn't even get the low key!

2864
02:09:30,820 --> 02:09:34,580
I got robbed of the double bounce.

2865
02:09:38,920 --> 02:09:41,380
We were so close.

2866
02:09:43,820 --> 02:09:45,700
We were so close.

2867
02:09:46,740 --> 02:09:48,880
They were getting too much.

2868
02:09:53,950 --> 02:09:57,770
Because I'm dead tired and pizza and my boss.

2869
02:09:58,350 --> 02:09:59,290
What's wrong?

2870
02:10:00,650 --> 02:10:01,290
Weak.

2871
02:10:02,210 --> 02:10:02,830
Pizza, come play.

2872
02:10:03,550 --> 02:10:04,790
Pizza, come play.

2873
02:10:05,210 --> 02:10:07,950
I'll join VC and let you throw.

2874
02:10:22,070 --> 02:10:23,230
Every time I win.

2875
02:10:28,090 --> 02:10:29,260
Bad friend.

2876
02:10:31,930 --> 02:10:35,090
Who the fuck is Doki's cat ears?

2877
02:10:36,010 --> 02:10:38,690
Wait, I need to...

2878
02:10:40,250 --> 02:10:41,330
Let's go.

2879
02:10:41,770 --> 02:10:42,250
Reject.

2880
02:10:53,050 --> 02:10:53,730
Yoink.

2881
02:11:00,130 --> 02:11:03,270
Here we go.

2882
02:11:04,110 --> 02:11:05,430
Let's go.

2883
02:11:06,630 --> 02:11:09,170
I don't even have pizzas to scream.

2884
02:11:09,590 --> 02:11:11,210
I lied.

2885
02:11:15,930 --> 02:11:18,030
Masterfully done.

2886
02:11:18,030 --> 02:11:19,410
Look at that.

2887
02:11:19,530 --> 02:11:21,030
And that's how you guys...

2888
02:11:21,610 --> 02:11:23,210
And that's how you kidnap players.

2889
02:11:26,350 --> 02:11:26,950
Excellent.

2890
02:11:27,110 --> 02:11:27,590
See guys?

2891
02:11:27,670 --> 02:11:29,370
I told you I was gonna kidnap a player.

2892
02:11:29,810 --> 02:11:30,630
I did it.

2893
02:11:31,330 --> 02:11:33,450
I kidnapped Taco onto my stack.

2894
02:11:36,610 --> 02:11:38,270
Our duo now.

2895
02:11:39,310 --> 02:11:40,210
It's that easy.

2896
02:11:40,930 --> 02:11:42,490
It's just...

2897
02:11:43,030 --> 02:11:44,010
Thank you.

2898
02:11:44,110 --> 02:11:44,870
Thank you guys.

2899
02:11:45,050 --> 02:11:45,310
See?

2900
02:11:45,910 --> 02:11:47,150
My title wasn't a lie.

2901
02:11:49,010 --> 02:11:51,590
Managed to kidnap somebody to join me.

2902
02:11:52,310 --> 02:11:55,810
She's actually so good at this.

2903
02:11:57,670 --> 02:11:58,290
Yoink.

2904
02:11:59,690 --> 02:12:00,990
Oh shit, okay.

2905
02:12:02,390 --> 02:12:04,610
Oh wait, they invited me to the Discord.

2906
02:12:04,790 --> 02:12:07,430
Wait, they just invited me to the Discord?

2907
02:12:11,720 --> 02:12:12,960
I think they did.

2908
02:12:13,520 --> 02:12:15,000
I won't talk to you guys any longer.

2909
02:12:15,800 --> 02:12:18,200
Or maybe I'll just lie and be...

2910
02:12:19,380 --> 02:12:21,280
She's done this before.

2911
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:27,200
Please show me your ways.

2912
02:12:27,420 --> 02:12:31,720
Just call the other duo weak and then take the one that's still strong.

2913
02:12:34,480 --> 02:12:36,220
Just don't take the weak one.

2914
02:12:36,500 --> 02:12:37,440
It's just that easy.

2915
02:12:37,860 --> 02:12:41,760
You call one of them weak and then the other duo will be like, Wait, I'm not weak.

2916
02:12:42,100 --> 02:12:44,200
And then now they're in your team.

2917
02:12:44,940 --> 02:12:45,840
Hello, are we roleplaying?

2918
02:12:46,800 --> 02:12:48,760
Wait, can you talk in these match ads?

2919
02:12:49,640 --> 02:12:50,760
Oh, you can.

2920
02:12:51,740 --> 02:12:52,640
How much?

2921
02:13:00,460 --> 02:13:02,800
Oh my god, it's just like the Overwatch...

2922
02:13:02,800 --> 02:13:06,540
It's just like the Overwatch RP series.

2923
02:13:07,360 --> 02:13:08,260
Right there.

2924
02:13:09,460 --> 02:13:10,260
Oh my god.

2925
02:13:10,280 --> 02:13:12,180
Oh my god, two for one?

2926
02:13:12,300 --> 02:13:13,700
Let's go, smack that.

2927
02:13:15,360 --> 02:13:16,520
I'm just...

2928
02:13:16,520 --> 02:13:18,300
I'm just smacking.

2929
02:13:18,300 --> 02:13:19,540
Wait, no!

2930
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:22,780
I'm just smacking.

2931
02:13:24,320 --> 02:13:25,400
The butt.

2932
02:13:28,120 --> 02:13:30,920
I didn't know there was a no touch rule.

2933
02:13:32,400 --> 02:13:33,340
I didn't know...

2934
02:13:33,340 --> 02:13:34,760
No touching.

2935
02:13:35,500 --> 02:13:40,220
I didn't know.

2936
02:13:42,500 --> 02:13:44,340
Can't touch the merchandise.

2937
02:13:47,180 --> 02:13:49,420
Yeah, he's his own bouncer.

2938
02:13:50,660 --> 02:13:51,060
Wait.

2939
02:13:51,680 --> 02:13:53,140
Oh shit, wait, he's in here.

2940
02:13:55,180 --> 02:13:55,580
Oops.

2941
02:13:56,780 --> 02:13:59,240
Just like in real life, can't touch for free, alright.

2942
02:14:00,120 --> 02:14:02,480
I can watch but no touch, apparently.

2943
02:14:03,220 --> 02:14:03,860
Let's go.

2944
02:14:04,420 --> 02:14:05,500
Wait, can I swap characters?

2945
02:14:05,640 --> 02:14:06,740
No, I have to die to swap.

2946
02:14:07,720 --> 02:14:08,560
Oh my god.

2947
02:14:09,160 --> 02:14:10,320
Would it be wrong?

2948
02:14:10,400 --> 02:14:13,240
Okay, there's one character I want to swap to, but it might be wrong.

2949
02:14:13,920 --> 02:14:15,280
Wait, I'm sorry, I was enjoying...

2950
02:14:15,280 --> 02:14:15,440
Oh!

2951
02:14:17,980 --> 02:14:19,520
I'm sorry, I'm enjoying this.

2952
02:14:19,800 --> 02:14:21,180
I'm sorry, please keep smacking.

2953
02:14:23,460 --> 02:14:24,460
I love this emote.

2954
02:14:24,580 --> 02:14:26,640
Truly is one of the best emotes out there.

2955
02:14:28,860 --> 02:14:30,280
No, I was gonna...

2956
02:14:33,600 --> 02:14:34,560
I don't know.

2957
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:36,520
Maybe I could.

2958
02:14:36,620 --> 02:14:38,480
Okay, is there like a pit I could fall through?

2959
02:14:39,460 --> 02:14:40,980
Wait, I just need them to kill me.

2960
02:14:42,040 --> 02:14:42,900
Game mode.

2961
02:14:43,120 --> 02:14:47,040
Honestly, the fact that it's for free is actually crazy.

2962
02:14:47,480 --> 02:14:48,220
I can't...

2963
02:14:48,220 --> 02:14:54,800
People would actually pay like hundreds of thousands of dollars for this fucking emote.

2964
02:14:54,920 --> 02:14:59,360
So the fact that this emote is free is actually criminal.

2965
02:15:03,340 --> 02:15:05,020
There's a pit in dining room?

2966
02:15:05,240 --> 02:15:06,260
Where's the dining room?

2967
02:15:07,560 --> 02:15:10,480
I don't know this area very well.

2968
02:15:12,620 --> 02:15:13,580
Actually don't know.

2969
02:15:13,700 --> 02:15:14,780
Okay, that's outside.

2970
02:15:15,680 --> 02:15:17,280
That's also outside.

2971
02:15:18,620 --> 02:15:20,060
Wait, is that the dining?

2972
02:15:20,200 --> 02:15:21,000
Oh, there it is.

2973
02:15:21,720 --> 02:15:22,560
Right here.

2974
02:15:25,760 --> 02:15:26,240
Alright.

2975
02:15:26,520 --> 02:15:27,500
Wait, that's not...

2976
02:15:27,500 --> 02:15:28,300
This is not the pit?

2977
02:15:29,540 --> 02:15:30,440
It's not it?

2978
02:15:34,180 --> 02:15:35,260
Oh, I lied.

2979
02:15:35,520 --> 02:15:37,600
People lie on the internet like that?

2980
02:15:37,820 --> 02:15:41,100
Oh, just like how I'm lying the pizza that I was gonna join VC?

2981
02:15:44,100 --> 02:15:44,520
Hahaha.

2982
02:15:47,700 --> 02:15:49,340
Oh my god.

2983
02:15:49,520 --> 02:15:51,920
People that's not me also lie?

2984
02:15:52,840 --> 02:15:54,760
Oh my god.

2985
02:15:56,900 --> 02:15:58,260
That's crazy.

2986
02:15:59,040 --> 02:16:00,320
Wait, how am I mean?

2987
02:16:01,840 --> 02:16:04,300
How am I mean, guys?

2988
02:16:05,960 --> 02:16:08,060
Does this look like a face that's a mean...

2989
02:16:08,060 --> 02:16:08,920
That's...

2990
02:16:08,920 --> 02:16:10,320
That's a bad kitty?

2991
02:16:11,960 --> 02:16:12,400
Haha.

2992
02:16:12,400 --> 02:16:12,560
Hahaha.

2993
02:16:14,660 --> 02:16:15,420
Hahaha.

2994
02:16:16,660 --> 02:16:16,880
Hahaha.

2995
02:16:19,120 --> 02:16:20,240
Yes.

2996
02:16:21,580 --> 02:16:23,720
Very bad.

2997
02:16:28,240 --> 02:16:28,800
100%.

2998
02:16:29,360 --> 02:16:30,780
Holy shit.

2999
02:16:31,660 --> 02:16:33,240
Where are these queue times?

3000
02:16:35,080 --> 02:16:36,800
That's a crazy...

3001
02:16:37,340 --> 02:16:39,240
That's a crazy queue time.

3002
02:16:39,360 --> 02:16:39,980
Is this normal?

3003
02:16:40,740 --> 02:16:43,420
Is this a normal queue time at these hours?

3004
02:16:44,860 --> 02:16:46,060
It's like 1...

3005
02:16:46,060 --> 02:16:47,280
It's only 1.30.

3006
02:16:49,100 --> 02:16:50,980
It's only 1.30 AM.

3007
02:16:54,460 --> 02:16:55,060
Yes.

3008
02:16:55,320 --> 02:16:56,140
Oh my gosh.

3009
02:16:56,440 --> 02:16:56,940
Good game.

3010
02:16:57,460 --> 02:17:01,800
Maybe I need to stop doing DJIN hours so I can actually get games and lobbies.

3011
02:17:02,120 --> 02:17:02,900
Oh my god.

3012
02:17:02,940 --> 02:17:04,580
Is it back to ROBLOX hours?

3013
02:17:05,440 --> 02:17:05,880
Is it...

3014
02:17:05,880 --> 02:17:06,240
Haha.

3015
02:17:06,400 --> 02:17:07,100
Is it time?

3016
02:17:07,860 --> 02:17:08,240
Alright.

3017
02:17:08,840 --> 02:17:10,640
Alright, guys.

3018
02:17:10,960 --> 02:17:13,240
If the queue time goes to...

3019
02:17:15,220 --> 02:17:15,500
It's...

3020
02:17:15,780 --> 02:17:15,800
Exactly!

3021
02:17:16,040 --> 02:17:17,300
It's only 1.30!

3022
02:17:17,880 --> 02:17:20,300
How are queue times that bad?

3023
02:17:20,620 --> 02:17:23,000
It's only 1.30.

3024
02:17:24,200 --> 02:17:24,680
Oh.

3025
02:17:24,840 --> 02:17:25,160
Okay.

3026
02:17:25,500 --> 02:17:26,280
I was gonna say.

3027
02:17:26,560 --> 02:17:27,860
I was gonna pull up the ROBLOX.

3028
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:36,900
Oh, true.

3029
02:17:37,060 --> 02:17:37,540
4.30.

3030
02:17:37,620 --> 02:17:37,900
Oh, hey.

3031
02:17:37,920 --> 02:17:39,360
There's Señor Raz again.

3032
02:17:40,420 --> 02:17:41,380
There he is.

3033
02:17:43,920 --> 02:17:46,420
They do not want me playing ROBLOX.

3034
02:17:48,480 --> 02:17:49,040
Alright.

3035
02:17:49,520 --> 02:17:50,120
I wanna...

3036
02:17:50,120 --> 02:17:50,940
Okay, not throw it.

3037
02:17:50,980 --> 02:17:52,040
I'm not gonna throw it, guys.

3038
02:17:52,140 --> 02:17:53,360
But what if...

3039
02:17:53,360 --> 02:17:54,700
We do it again?

3040
02:17:54,980 --> 02:17:58,020
Now that he's not here to stop me.

3041
02:18:06,660 --> 02:18:08,160
What if we do that...

3042
02:18:08,440 --> 02:18:10,480
What if we try to do that again?

3043
02:18:11,380 --> 02:18:11,980
And...

3044
02:18:13,480 --> 02:18:14,080
No!

3045
02:18:14,300 --> 02:18:15,200
Don't kid me!

3046
02:18:15,800 --> 02:18:16,400
No!

3047
02:18:28,280 --> 02:18:32,000
Oh, it's not the low-key pick that's throwing.

3048
02:18:33,580 --> 02:18:35,800
It's what I wanna do with my ult.

3049
02:18:39,570 --> 02:18:40,590
Alright, let's see.

3050
02:18:40,590 --> 02:18:42,590
Yeah, we have to ban Wolverine because we have a Groot.

3051
02:18:55,370 --> 02:18:55,650
Alright.

3052
02:18:58,610 --> 02:18:59,530
It's time.

3053
02:19:00,350 --> 02:19:02,470
Oh, I could go...

3054
02:19:02,470 --> 02:19:03,190
Sue.

3055
02:19:03,910 --> 02:19:05,130
It'll make this easier.

3056
02:19:16,710 --> 02:19:17,250
Silver!

3057
02:19:17,550 --> 02:19:18,450
Thank you for Twitch Prime!

3058
02:19:18,450 --> 02:19:18,830
Thank you!

3059
02:19:19,090 --> 02:19:19,630
Thank you!

3060
02:19:20,090 --> 02:19:24,250
And Marco, thank you for the gift to your oneself.

3061
02:19:31,110 --> 02:19:31,600
Do something...

3062
02:19:33,050 --> 02:19:34,710
Do something fun?

3063
02:19:44,610 --> 02:19:47,110
You do something fun, right?

3064
02:19:48,450 --> 02:19:49,170
I think that's Pizza.

3065
02:19:50,210 --> 02:19:52,170
I don't think he knows who Pizza is.

3066
02:19:52,170 --> 02:19:56,110
Eating pizza, swap off, you fucking numbnut.

3067
02:20:05,870 --> 02:20:07,710
What the fuck?

3068
02:20:12,130 --> 02:20:14,450
Bro, they don't know who Pizza is?

3069
02:20:14,650 --> 02:20:19,990
Like, is he really the only guy that can make Mr. Fantastic work?

3070
02:20:20,610 --> 02:20:21,770
Guys, I don't think he'll...

3071
02:20:22,170 --> 02:20:24,530
Guys, I don't think I can copy Mr...

3072
02:20:24,530 --> 02:20:25,130
I think...

3073
02:20:25,130 --> 02:20:27,310
I think our Groot is one bad day...

3074
02:20:28,470 --> 02:20:30,510
One bad day away.

3075
02:20:30,950 --> 02:20:32,630
Guys, I...

3076
02:20:33,470 --> 02:20:36,790
I legitimately believe he's one bad day away.

3077
02:20:37,130 --> 02:20:39,290
I don't think I can copy Pizza, guys.

3078
02:20:39,830 --> 02:20:41,990
I don't think...

3079
02:20:41,990 --> 02:20:43,310
Oh, he is 100...

3080
02:20:46,510 --> 02:20:48,990
It would be so good.

3081
02:20:50,650 --> 02:20:52,970
He is 100% one...

3082
02:20:52,970 --> 02:20:55,730
One bad day from something happening.

3083
02:20:59,370 --> 02:21:01,350
Jesus Christ, I have to reload, please.

3084
02:21:02,050 --> 02:21:02,290
Luna.

3085
02:21:04,130 --> 02:21:05,590
Oh my god, Luna.

3086
02:21:07,890 --> 02:21:08,570
Please.

3087
02:21:08,810 --> 02:21:10,190
I have to reload.

3088
02:21:11,610 --> 02:21:12,210
No!

3089
02:21:12,710 --> 02:21:13,230
No!

3090
02:21:19,660 --> 02:21:21,440
I actually lost my ult.

3091
02:21:22,420 --> 02:21:23,720
Oh my god.

3092
02:21:24,740 --> 02:21:25,620
Oh no.

3093
02:21:27,500 --> 02:21:29,160
I lost my ult, sis.

3094
02:21:32,500 --> 02:21:33,460
Oh no.

3095
02:21:33,700 --> 02:21:34,080
That was bad.

3096
02:21:34,120 --> 02:21:35,180
I was too cocky there.

3097
02:21:35,400 --> 02:21:36,180
I don't know if we can...

3098
02:21:36,900 --> 02:21:37,640
I don't know.

3099
02:21:39,180 --> 02:21:40,560
I don't know, guys.

3100
02:21:42,300 --> 02:21:42,780
Yeah.

3101
02:21:44,280 --> 02:21:45,240
Yeah, that...

3102
02:21:45,240 --> 02:21:47,060
That portal was not it.

3103
02:21:47,920 --> 02:21:49,700
How do you put clones up here?

3104
02:21:50,340 --> 02:21:51,300
Like, I don't...

3105
02:21:51,300 --> 02:21:52,120
Am I gonna break this?

3106
02:21:52,340 --> 02:21:52,740
Yeah, okay.

3107
02:21:52,740 --> 02:21:56,280
I was gonna say, I don't know where is the best place to put clones here.

3108
02:21:56,760 --> 02:21:58,020
Maybe I should go Sue.

3109
02:21:59,080 --> 02:21:59,580
Maybe...

3110
02:22:01,360 --> 02:22:02,740
Guys, I don't want...

3111
02:22:03,880 --> 02:22:05,700
I don't want him to yell at me.

3112
02:22:08,220 --> 02:22:10,160
The crashout is very imminent.

3113
02:22:10,880 --> 02:22:11,720
I can feel it.

3114
02:22:12,400 --> 02:22:13,820
I can feel it, guys.

3115
02:22:14,660 --> 02:22:16,810
I can feel the bad day coming in.

3116
02:22:17,540 --> 02:22:17,940
I...

3117
02:22:21,100 --> 02:22:21,980
Oh shit.

3118
02:22:21,980 --> 02:22:24,200
Got me out of invis too.

3119
02:22:26,020 --> 02:22:27,280
The whole kit.

3120
02:22:29,360 --> 02:22:30,320
Nice.

3121
02:22:33,700 --> 02:22:35,620
Guys, I...

3122
02:22:35,620 --> 02:22:38,380
I'm sorry, I didn't have invuln.

3123
02:22:38,580 --> 02:22:40,020
I'm sorry.

3124
02:22:43,640 --> 02:22:45,580
I didn't have...

3125
02:22:45,580 --> 02:22:45,920
Okay.

3126
02:22:46,560 --> 02:22:47,080
It's time.

3127
02:22:48,720 --> 02:22:49,500
Don't worry.

3128
02:22:50,420 --> 02:22:53,700
Now it's time to actually focus up a little.

3129
02:23:07,500 --> 02:23:09,140
Oh my god.

3130
02:23:09,320 --> 02:23:11,020
Enemy is always like this.

3131
02:23:11,720 --> 02:23:13,660
He doesn't even change how he's mean.

3132
02:23:14,340 --> 02:23:14,820
Wow.

3133
02:23:15,020 --> 02:23:16,420
I didn't have push.

3134
02:23:16,420 --> 02:23:19,420
Oh my god.

3135
02:23:19,800 --> 02:23:20,800
I didn't have push.

3136
02:23:23,980 --> 02:23:24,560
Today...

3137
02:23:24,560 --> 02:23:25,980
I think it's today, guys.

3138
02:23:26,720 --> 02:23:27,560
I think today...

3139
02:23:32,080 --> 02:23:35,580
Guys, I think today is his bad day, guys.

3140
02:23:36,260 --> 02:23:36,860
I...

3141
02:23:36,860 --> 02:23:38,580
I think it's today.

3142
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:42,840
Oh my god.

3143
02:23:48,700 --> 02:23:49,720
It's today.

3144
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,080
Today is the bad day.

3145
02:23:52,700 --> 02:23:54,120
It's gonna happen.

3146
02:23:56,420 --> 02:23:56,980
It's fine.

3147
02:24:00,520 --> 02:24:02,260
Okay, I have to do that.

3148
02:24:02,480 --> 02:24:03,620
Everybody was so low.

3149
02:24:05,060 --> 02:24:05,480
Damn.

3150
02:24:05,840 --> 02:24:07,800
We're gonna witness the biggest...

3151
02:24:07,800 --> 02:24:09,020
We're gonna witness the crash out.

3152
02:24:10,200 --> 02:24:11,620
I swear to god.

3153
02:24:12,020 --> 02:24:13,060
Okay, nice.

3154
02:24:16,420 --> 02:24:17,520
There we go.

3155
02:24:18,160 --> 02:24:18,840
It's fine.

3156
02:24:18,900 --> 02:24:19,920
Everything is okay.

3157
02:24:20,460 --> 02:24:22,380
Everything is so...

3158
02:24:22,380 --> 02:24:23,700
It's not today.

3159
02:24:23,840 --> 02:24:25,580
It's literally right now.

3160
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,440
We're experiencing it live.

3161
02:24:37,200 --> 02:24:38,700
It's not even here!

3162
02:24:38,860 --> 02:24:40,260
You finally fucking speak.

3163
02:24:41,220 --> 02:24:42,060
Are you serious?

3164
02:24:42,360 --> 02:24:43,000
It broke!

3165
02:24:43,540 --> 02:24:47,960
It's not even in this game!

3166
02:24:48,960 --> 02:24:49,940
It's cause he...

3167
02:24:49,940 --> 02:24:51,560
It's cause he sees pizza!

3168
02:24:53,900 --> 02:24:54,660
Bro!

3169
02:24:55,260 --> 02:24:56,920
He doesn't know I...

3170
02:24:56,920 --> 02:24:58,000
I stole...

3171
02:24:58,000 --> 02:24:59,360
I stole his duo.

3172
02:25:00,320 --> 02:25:01,220
I see...

3173
02:25:01,220 --> 02:25:02,360
It's not even here.

3174
02:25:02,660 --> 02:25:04,340
How is he like...

3175
02:25:04,340 --> 02:25:06,060
That's crazy.

3176
02:25:08,040 --> 02:25:09,560
That's crazy.

3177
02:25:10,240 --> 02:25:11,660
I can't.

3178
02:25:12,120 --> 02:25:12,980
I can't.

3179
02:25:12,980 --> 02:25:14,640
Not again!

3180
02:25:16,120 --> 02:25:17,120
Not again!

3181
02:25:18,320 --> 02:25:21,480
Bro, he's beefing with ghosts right now.

3182
02:25:24,400 --> 02:25:25,700
Not again!

3183
02:25:26,440 --> 02:25:27,900
He's sniffing shanties.

3184
02:25:28,700 --> 02:25:30,400
The current score is...

3185
02:25:30,400 --> 02:25:35,300
0-2-3 Time to switch things up.

3186
02:25:35,940 --> 02:25:36,700
I'm winning.

3187
02:25:37,600 --> 02:25:39,260
I got my hand on it, bro.

3188
02:25:39,360 --> 02:25:39,740
I'm ready.

3189
02:25:39,900 --> 02:25:41,520
I'm monitoring my fucking feet.

3190
02:25:41,520 --> 02:25:42,940
Give me that shit right now.

3191
02:25:42,940 --> 02:25:46,300
I'm not the type who fits quietly into the background.

3192
02:25:46,320 --> 02:25:47,660
I'm still a fantastic buddy.

3193
02:25:47,960 --> 02:25:50,700
I got my hand on the button.

3194
02:25:51,320 --> 02:25:54,460
He's arguing with actual demons right now.

3195
02:25:54,540 --> 02:25:55,700
Oh my god, wait, it's Sakura!

3196
02:25:56,460 --> 02:25:58,640
For fuck's sakes, do you even play Fantastic?

3197
02:25:59,980 --> 02:26:01,140
Yes, he does!

3198
02:26:01,240 --> 02:26:01,720
What do you mean?

3199
02:26:02,040 --> 02:26:03,820
He does that every day!

3200
02:26:04,040 --> 02:26:04,800
I'm so miserable.

3201
02:26:05,900 --> 02:26:08,440
Bro, I want to fucking cry right now.

3202
02:26:08,560 --> 02:26:11,460
I've lost 10 million subscribers playing you in fucking Fantastic.

3203
02:26:13,140 --> 02:26:16,120
These guys have world record time on us.

3204
02:26:16,160 --> 02:26:17,340
They have three fucking minutes.

3205
02:26:17,420 --> 02:26:18,660
I've never seen that before.

3206
02:26:18,820 --> 02:26:19,760
Like, we're just doomed.

3207
02:26:21,340 --> 02:26:23,380
Man, I want to fucking cry, dude.

3208
02:26:23,480 --> 02:26:27,300
Because every game I play, I don't want to fucking kill myself.

3209
02:26:28,240 --> 02:26:30,680
Well, no, it's not you in general.

3210
02:26:30,920 --> 02:26:33,020
But, like, why the fuck are you playing Fantastic?

3211
02:26:33,220 --> 02:26:33,960
You didn't even play that.

3212
02:26:34,480 --> 02:26:36,560
You didn't even play Fantastic, dude.

3213
02:26:36,660 --> 02:26:37,620
Like, do you even play that shit?

3214
02:26:37,620 --> 02:26:41,080
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

3215
02:26:41,900 --> 02:26:43,680
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

3216
02:26:43,940 --> 02:26:45,440
I promise, holy shit, dude.

3217
02:26:45,480 --> 02:26:46,500
I do have to change my voice.

3218
02:26:46,900 --> 02:26:47,620
No, you don't.

3219
02:26:47,680 --> 02:26:49,720
You sound like you got your nose plugged firm again.

3220
02:26:50,020 --> 02:26:50,760
Fuck's sakes.

3221
02:26:51,580 --> 02:26:52,800
Let's be serious here.

3222
02:26:52,860 --> 02:26:53,460
Let's not do this.

3223
02:26:54,460 --> 02:26:56,500
Gomez, Gomez had to fucking dip.

3224
02:26:56,600 --> 02:26:57,920
You made him lose 200 SR.

3225
02:26:58,060 --> 02:26:59,260
And I just played Fantastic.

3226
02:27:00,140 --> 02:27:01,400
Oh my god, bro.

3227
02:27:01,440 --> 02:27:03,460
You were tripping with Gomez on the rop camp.

3228
02:27:03,560 --> 02:27:04,320
For fuck's sakes.

3229
02:27:04,440 --> 02:27:06,560
Now you're just fucking doing everything, dude.

3230
02:27:06,560 --> 02:27:10,280
Oh my goodness.

3231
02:27:10,500 --> 02:27:12,560
You're even on fucking Fantastic.

3232
02:27:12,900 --> 02:27:14,240
You're like, you're just great.

3233
02:27:14,600 --> 02:27:15,580
Did you get off Fantastic?

3234
02:27:16,040 --> 02:27:17,860
Did you get off Fantastic?

3235
02:27:19,200 --> 02:27:21,540
I love Marvel Rivals, guys.

3236
02:27:22,940 --> 02:27:23,980
Hey, guys.

3237
02:27:24,600 --> 02:27:25,400
How was your day?

3238
02:27:26,320 --> 02:27:28,200
Why does this always happen?

3239
02:27:28,480 --> 02:27:29,600
Why is this my duo?

3240
02:27:31,280 --> 02:27:33,120
I got 10 yesterday.

3241
02:27:33,240 --> 02:27:33,780
How about that?

3242
02:27:33,780 --> 02:27:36,240
Yeah, I'm pretty full of it.

3243
02:27:41,400 --> 02:27:42,440
Holy shit.

3244
02:27:42,520 --> 02:27:44,460
You're throwing for fucking Mei, aren't you, Bob?

3245
02:27:45,520 --> 02:27:47,000
What the fuck?

3246
02:27:47,460 --> 02:27:49,040
What is he throwing for?

3247
02:27:49,420 --> 02:27:50,960
It's okay, guys.

3248
02:27:52,380 --> 02:27:53,060
Disappear.

3249
02:27:54,060 --> 02:27:55,220
It's okay.

3250
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,180
We should be fine, right?

3251
02:27:59,960 --> 02:28:03,240
Oh, he's so...

3252
02:28:03,240 --> 02:28:04,680
He's alive.

3253
02:28:06,400 --> 02:28:07,080
There we go.

3254
02:28:07,820 --> 02:28:09,020
See, we should be fine.

3255
02:28:10,960 --> 02:28:12,160
I need a push.

3256
02:28:12,260 --> 02:28:13,900
I'm so like not used to it.

3257
02:28:15,360 --> 02:28:16,620
Oh god, I'm so...

3258
02:28:16,620 --> 02:28:17,740
Oh god, okay.

3259
02:28:18,420 --> 02:28:23,240
I'm like so not used to using my push for it.

3260
02:28:23,680 --> 02:28:24,600
I'm not good enough.

3261
02:28:27,880 --> 02:28:28,740
Oh no.

3262
02:28:30,020 --> 02:28:31,520
Oh no, please.

3263
02:28:32,640 --> 02:28:33,060
Please.

3264
02:28:33,920 --> 02:28:35,120
Where's our 10 gifted?

3265
02:28:36,560 --> 02:28:37,920
Where's our 10 gifted?

3266
02:28:43,090 --> 02:28:44,270
Guys, he's crashing.

3267
02:28:45,350 --> 02:28:47,310
I love these people who get paid to throw my games.

3268
02:28:47,430 --> 02:28:48,170
This shit's awesome.

3269
02:28:51,270 --> 02:28:51,870
Go, bro.

3270
02:28:51,990 --> 02:28:53,330
Pizza's not the problem, bro.

3271
02:28:53,350 --> 02:28:54,110
Thought you wouldn't see me again.

3272
02:28:54,210 --> 02:28:55,830
It's because I sound miserable.

3273
02:28:56,050 --> 02:28:57,150
That's why we don't like pizza.

3274
02:28:57,150 --> 02:29:00,770
Our enemies are here.

3275
02:29:03,830 --> 02:29:07,710
Guys, now you know I was hesitant above the three stars.

3276
02:29:12,210 --> 02:29:14,510
I've seen their journey.

3277
02:29:17,110 --> 02:29:19,890
Bro, this guy's going through it, guys.

3278
02:29:21,470 --> 02:29:22,770
Guys, he's so...

3279
02:29:25,810 --> 02:29:29,070
Guys, this is not a good day for him.

3280
02:29:45,430 --> 02:29:45,990
Guys,

3281
02:29:49,950 --> 02:29:50,930
they don't know what I'm doing.

3282
02:29:50,930 --> 02:29:53,250
Okay, my reputation is okay.

3283
02:29:55,830 --> 02:29:59,110
I didn't make a guy about to crash out.

3284
02:30:01,830 --> 02:30:08,930
I'm just saying, like, if I didn't kidnap pizza, he would not have fucking about to...

3285
02:30:11,250 --> 02:30:16,210
He would not have encountered Sakura going through the worst day of his life right now.

3286
02:30:23,250 --> 02:30:24,810
Oh my god.

3287
02:30:27,270 --> 02:30:29,030
Guys, it's not my fault.

3288
02:30:31,250 --> 02:30:33,310
Oh my god, I'm trying to save you, buddy.

3289
02:30:35,050 --> 02:30:36,110
Oh my god.

3290
02:30:37,510 --> 02:30:37,950
Guys.

3291
02:30:40,450 --> 02:30:49,110
In the end, it may or may not be my fault that I brought pizza into Sakura's world.

3292
02:30:49,110 --> 02:30:51,550
It may or may...

3293
02:30:54,620 --> 02:30:59,010
It may or may not be my fault that I did that.

3294
02:31:03,490 --> 02:31:08,630
I might have... I might have ruined somebody today.

3295
02:31:11,970 --> 02:31:15,450
April Fools, April Fools.

3296
02:31:24,590 --> 02:31:25,010
What?

3297
02:31:41,940 --> 02:31:44,360
I hope we get them on the enemy team.

3298
02:31:44,580 --> 02:31:47,260
I hope I get Sakura on the enemy team and buy a miracle.

3299
02:31:48,240 --> 02:31:54,680
I hope that somehow my team wins so I can witness the crash out.

3300
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,140
Crash out 2.0.

3301
02:31:58,360 --> 02:31:59,900
That is the dream.

3302
02:32:05,080 --> 02:32:07,060
Hey, I received an upvote!

3303
02:32:07,240 --> 02:32:08,080
He doesn't know!

3304
02:32:11,520 --> 02:32:13,920
Sakura gave me an upvote!

3305
02:32:14,460 --> 02:32:15,340
Let's go!

3306
02:32:16,240 --> 02:32:18,040
I got an upvote from Sakura!

3307
02:32:27,690 --> 02:32:29,350
No, he's not a group main.

3308
02:32:29,470 --> 02:32:31,410
He's actually... He's a strange main.

3309
02:32:32,330 --> 02:32:35,030
I know, because I know Sakura from the first season.

3310
02:32:38,620 --> 02:32:39,840
Oh, is it him?

3311
02:32:41,280 --> 02:32:42,520
Oh my god!

3312
02:32:47,160 --> 02:32:50,500
I'm still sorry I went with Bangroot just because I don't like playing against Groot.

3313
02:32:52,240 --> 02:32:53,240
Oh, it is?

3314
02:32:53,360 --> 02:32:53,720
Okay.

3315
02:32:54,600 --> 02:32:55,520
We ban Adam?

3316
02:32:56,700 --> 02:32:59,000
I'll do Adam, then Groot then.

3317
02:32:59,240 --> 02:33:01,100
Because we have a Hella and a Neymar player.

3318
02:33:05,580 --> 02:33:06,180
Hello?

3319
02:33:10,120 --> 02:33:11,220
Oh, he's back.

3320
02:33:11,540 --> 02:33:11,840
Okay.

3321
02:33:12,500 --> 02:33:12,760
Hello?

3322
02:33:14,240 --> 02:33:14,840
Okay.

3323
02:33:22,200 --> 02:33:22,800
Alright.

3324
02:33:23,700 --> 02:33:25,160
I'll have to go Luna for it.

3325
02:33:29,020 --> 02:33:30,140
It's so funny.

3326
02:33:30,280 --> 02:33:31,600
They think, like...

3327
02:33:31,600 --> 02:33:36,100
They think he's, like... They ban Starlord because he's fighting his demons right now.

3328
02:33:36,480 --> 02:33:37,160
Like...

3329
02:33:37,160 --> 02:33:41,380
He doesn't know pizzas with me right now.

3330
02:33:41,700 --> 02:33:45,320
So he's banning Starlord because Gomez plays Starlord.

3331
02:33:45,620 --> 02:33:51,980
And he thinks it's a Pizza Gomez duo right now.

3332
02:33:52,020 --> 02:33:55,500
But he doesn't know I'm the one that yoinked him.

3333
02:33:57,980 --> 02:33:58,800
Hahaha.

3334
02:34:00,320 --> 02:34:01,560
We take this.

3335
02:34:04,990 --> 02:34:06,720
He's actually fighting his demons.

3336
02:34:11,570 --> 02:34:11,980
Alright.

3337
02:34:13,240 --> 02:34:15,000
Alright, I'll give it to Pizza.

3338
02:34:16,490 --> 02:34:17,280
April Fools!

3339
02:34:18,800 --> 02:34:20,030
April Fools!

3340
02:34:22,220 --> 02:34:23,040
I...

3341
02:34:23,450 --> 02:34:26,140
It would be great if we win this.

3342
02:34:26,680 --> 02:34:29,180
Just for the sake of the crashout.

3343
02:34:29,740 --> 02:34:31,740
I want to know what he'll say.

3344
02:34:32,420 --> 02:34:32,860
Like...

3345
02:34:32,860 --> 02:34:36,620
Like, we're giving him... Today's his... It takes one bad day.

3346
02:34:36,720 --> 02:34:38,980
And that's... Today is... It's happening right now.

3347
02:34:39,080 --> 02:34:40,240
We're watching it right now.

3348
02:34:46,020 --> 02:34:48,720
I don't know who to give it to.

3349
02:34:48,780 --> 02:34:50,360
Because we have Hela and Namor.

3350
02:34:50,540 --> 02:34:52,280
And then that's, like, both, like, good.

3351
02:34:54,160 --> 02:34:55,800
They're both good flanking characters.

3352
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:58,420
I don't know who's gonna flank more.

3353
02:35:01,780 --> 02:35:02,880
Oh, shit.

3354
02:35:05,300 --> 02:35:06,820
What the fuck?

3355
02:35:08,700 --> 02:35:10,320
Oh my god.

3356
02:35:11,620 --> 02:35:13,360
Oh, I need a reload.

3357
02:35:17,620 --> 02:35:18,760
Oh, please.

3358
02:35:19,200 --> 02:35:19,540
Please.

3359
02:35:19,900 --> 02:35:20,500
Please!

3360
02:35:20,500 --> 02:35:23,000
He's missing so much!

3361
02:35:23,640 --> 02:35:26,860
Oh my...

3362
02:35:28,520 --> 02:35:30,460
Oh, I thought I could.

3363
02:35:31,160 --> 02:35:31,960
That's crazy.

3364
02:35:32,380 --> 02:35:33,780
He actually missed so much.

3365
02:35:34,920 --> 02:35:35,440
Wait.

3366
02:35:35,700 --> 02:35:36,480
He's just...

3367
02:35:37,140 --> 02:35:37,660
1v5...

3368
02:35:37,660 --> 02:35:38,620
1v3ing them.

3369
02:35:38,720 --> 02:35:41,340
Is he...

3370
02:35:41,340 --> 02:35:42,320
Oh my god.

3371
02:35:42,360 --> 02:35:42,960
How is he...

3372
02:35:43,580 --> 02:35:45,180
What the fuck is going on?

3373
02:35:45,660 --> 02:35:47,000
What the...

3374
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:49,520
Bro, wasn't there, like, five people over there?

3375
02:35:49,800 --> 02:35:50,220
Oh, okay.

3376
02:35:50,240 --> 02:35:50,660
They're dead.

3377
02:35:52,280 --> 02:35:53,160
I was so confused.

3378
02:35:53,240 --> 02:35:54,920
And he was not taking any damage.

3379
02:35:55,580 --> 02:35:56,540
What was going...

3380
02:35:56,540 --> 02:35:57,420
He's just missing...

3381
02:35:57,420 --> 02:35:58,220
Can you hear me?

3382
02:36:00,360 --> 02:36:01,620
Okay, my mic's working.

3383
02:36:01,720 --> 02:36:02,080
That's good.

3384
02:36:05,180 --> 02:36:06,200
True, true.

3385
02:36:06,800 --> 02:36:07,740
He has to eat one person.

3386
02:36:08,800 --> 02:36:09,600
He ate nothing.

3387
02:36:11,640 --> 02:36:12,700
Oh my god!

3388
02:36:13,160 --> 02:36:14,300
Wait, he's not here!

3389
02:36:14,500 --> 02:36:15,020
No!

3390
02:36:21,190 --> 02:36:21,790
No!

3391
02:36:23,450 --> 02:36:24,550
You know he's...

3392
02:36:24,550 --> 02:36:26,190
Imsikuro was...

3393
02:36:29,450 --> 02:36:30,650
Imsikuro was...

3394
02:36:32,250 --> 02:36:34,370
Was in our game right now.

3395
02:36:34,390 --> 02:36:37,190
He would 100% say something about...

3396
02:36:38,730 --> 02:36:41,550
He would have said something about our fucking...

3397
02:36:41,550 --> 02:36:41,990
Shit.

3398
02:36:42,790 --> 02:36:43,230
I'm fine.

3399
02:36:43,790 --> 02:36:44,630
About the shark.

3400
02:36:45,010 --> 02:36:45,610
100%.

3401
02:36:45,610 --> 02:36:46,450
I feel it.

3402
02:36:47,010 --> 02:36:47,610
I fucked...

3403
02:36:47,610 --> 02:36:48,230
Okay, nice.

3404
02:36:49,510 --> 02:36:50,410
That's fine.

3405
02:36:50,890 --> 02:36:51,390
Go!

3406
02:36:52,450 --> 02:36:52,730
Go!

3407
02:36:53,270 --> 02:36:53,610
Pizza!

3408
02:36:53,850 --> 02:36:54,230
Go!

3409
02:36:54,850 --> 02:36:56,450
Do your thing, pizza!

3410
02:36:57,430 --> 02:36:58,410
Go, pizza!

3411
02:36:58,630 --> 02:36:58,930
Go!

3412
02:36:58,990 --> 02:36:59,370
You know what?

3413
02:36:59,370 --> 02:37:00,370
You deserve this.

3414
02:37:01,870 --> 02:37:03,520
You fucking deserve this.

3415
02:37:06,510 --> 02:37:09,510
Oh, I would never lose this.

3416
02:37:11,910 --> 02:37:13,670
Now you would go...

3417
02:37:13,670 --> 02:37:14,550
Is that Sakura?

3418
02:37:15,390 --> 02:37:18,670
From last game?

3419
02:37:19,610 --> 02:37:24,970
Oh, maybe they banned pizza because he thought the enemy team actually did that.

3420
02:37:26,330 --> 02:37:27,450
Is that him?

3421
02:37:27,450 --> 02:37:29,290
Are you okay?

3422
02:37:31,450 --> 02:37:32,750
Are you okay?

3423
02:37:33,530 --> 02:37:37,630
That was a pretty rough game.

3424
02:37:38,150 --> 02:37:39,950
Sorry for...

3425
02:37:47,370 --> 02:37:47,970
Sorry.

3426
02:37:58,530 --> 02:37:59,850
Where are you though?

3427
02:38:03,570 --> 02:38:04,650
I'll never tell.

3428
02:38:10,330 --> 02:38:11,250
Oh shit.

3429
02:38:11,730 --> 02:38:11,990
Hello?

3430
02:38:12,370 --> 02:38:16,050
Oh shit.

3431
02:38:17,230 --> 02:38:19,310
Wait, how am I still don't have ult yet?

3432
02:38:19,550 --> 02:38:20,650
I guess I'll just die?

3433
02:38:22,490 --> 02:38:23,010
Unless...

3434
02:38:23,010 --> 02:38:24,290
No, I definitely would just die.

3435
02:38:24,710 --> 02:38:26,610
I definitely would just die.

3436
02:38:34,050 --> 02:38:36,130
Someone needs a snowball in the cake.

3437
02:38:36,230 --> 02:38:37,070
Be strong together.

3438
02:38:37,630 --> 02:38:38,750
Alright, things are okay.

3439
02:38:40,790 --> 02:38:42,330
Why would I need you?

3440
02:38:42,350 --> 02:38:43,490
Everything is okay.

3441
02:38:43,610 --> 02:38:46,370
I do not know how fucking pizza...

3442
02:38:46,370 --> 02:38:50,950
He plays like every fucking off-meta shit possible and just makes it work.

3443
02:38:51,710 --> 02:38:54,110
Except for tank, like...

3444
02:38:54,110 --> 02:38:55,510
Never put that man on tank.

3445
02:38:57,550 --> 02:38:58,730
I like the clothes.

3446
02:38:59,570 --> 02:39:01,210
Sakura, you want a trio queue?

3447
02:39:02,850 --> 02:39:02,970
Haha.

3448
02:39:08,650 --> 02:39:10,330
Could be pizza.

3449
02:39:11,430 --> 02:39:12,710
On your main.

3450
02:39:14,690 --> 02:39:16,390
What is wrong?

3451
02:39:17,010 --> 02:39:20,190
Okay, do you remember when I said like...

3452
02:39:21,610 --> 02:39:23,250
Tank players are masochists?

3453
02:39:25,690 --> 02:39:27,110
Like, that's what I mean.

3454
02:39:27,190 --> 02:39:28,030
I'd rather...

3455
02:39:28,750 --> 02:39:29,750
I'd rather live.

3456
02:39:33,690 --> 02:39:34,350
That's nice.

3457
02:39:34,670 --> 02:39:36,710
I was not paying attention to what he was saying.

3458
02:39:37,950 --> 02:39:39,270
I was like, what did he say?

3459
02:39:39,470 --> 02:39:40,330
Was that damage?

3460
02:39:41,010 --> 02:39:41,830
I hope it was.

3461
02:39:43,890 --> 02:39:45,650
Oh, you know he's gonna play fantastic.

3462
02:39:51,740 --> 02:39:55,040
I think he'd be like, 10 gifted and we'll let you trio...

3463
02:39:55,040 --> 02:39:55,780
Fuck!

3464
02:39:57,080 --> 02:39:58,040
There's no way he'll shoot.

3465
02:40:01,520 --> 02:40:02,820
Okay, I need to watch this.

3466
02:40:06,520 --> 02:40:07,080
Oh my god.

3467
02:40:12,480 --> 02:40:15,800
Why would he shoot the whole...

3468
02:40:15,800 --> 02:40:18,280
I hear the fucking freeze.

3469
02:40:25,230 --> 02:40:26,480
That's a hate crime.

3470
02:40:26,920 --> 02:40:28,000
That's a hate crime.

3471
02:40:28,340 --> 02:40:30,400
There was like, four options.

3472
02:40:31,440 --> 02:40:34,080
There were four fucking options.

3473
02:40:37,260 --> 02:40:38,660
Why not shoot?

3474
02:40:38,780 --> 02:40:39,220
You're right.

3475
02:40:39,560 --> 02:40:40,940
There's a hole, there's a goal.

3476
02:40:42,020 --> 02:40:42,740
Where the fuck is...

3477
02:40:43,480 --> 02:40:45,800
You know, him throwing a hissy fit.

3478
02:40:49,380 --> 02:40:51,640
Wait, that's what I told you guys.

3479
02:40:52,120 --> 02:40:53,460
Tank players are masochists.

3480
02:40:54,200 --> 02:40:55,780
That guy was there, he's like...

3481
02:40:55,780 --> 02:40:58,940
He's like, let me in the three stack after what...

3482
02:41:00,320 --> 02:41:02,460
After what pizza was doing.

3483
02:41:03,240 --> 02:41:04,660
He's like, you know what?

3484
02:41:05,420 --> 02:41:06,840
I'll go through that again.

3485
02:41:07,280 --> 02:41:08,960
But like, consensual.

3486
02:41:09,480 --> 02:41:11,960
But consensually agree to be part of it.

3487
02:41:23,960 --> 02:41:27,740
I remember, I think like, Sakura's stream...

3488
02:41:27,740 --> 02:41:29,140
Was in my recommended ones.

3489
02:41:29,240 --> 02:41:30,060
I remember Sakura.

3490
02:41:31,420 --> 02:41:32,020
Because...

3491
02:41:32,020 --> 02:41:34,720
He unfortunately dropped to Celestial at one point.

3492
02:41:35,500 --> 02:41:38,880
And then he was like, trio stacking with two other pros.

3493
02:41:39,720 --> 02:41:43,460
And it was one of the most beautiful crashouts I've ever watched live.

3494
02:41:44,560 --> 02:41:45,000
LOL

3495
02:41:51,020 --> 02:41:54,140
Why are you seeing all of this?

3496
02:41:55,060 --> 02:41:56,160
It was like...

3497
02:41:56,160 --> 02:41:59,060
It was like a car crash that you couldn't stop looking.

3498
02:42:02,160 --> 02:42:04,620
Because the other two were on like, alt accounts.

3499
02:42:04,760 --> 02:42:06,660
They were like, trying to save their friend, you know?

3500
02:42:06,860 --> 02:42:08,700
But they can't save him from himself.

3501
02:42:11,960 --> 02:42:12,400
LOL

3502
02:42:15,500 --> 02:42:17,820
Oh shit, I'm not paying attention anymore.

3503
02:42:17,980 --> 02:42:19,680
I'm not...

3504
02:42:20,520 --> 02:42:22,420
I'm not paying attention.

3505
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:23,380
And then...

3506
02:42:23,940 --> 02:42:25,440
And I remember, like...

3507
02:42:25,440 --> 02:42:27,360
I remember this stream because it was just...

3508
02:42:28,120 --> 02:42:31,940
It was like, every game was like that last game that we watched.

3509
02:42:32,260 --> 02:42:33,220
That we were part of.

3510
02:42:33,300 --> 02:42:34,740
Like, every game was like that.

3511
02:42:35,480 --> 02:42:36,260
And it was like...

3512
02:42:36,260 --> 02:42:38,960
Because one of them was like, who used to be rank one.

3513
02:42:39,460 --> 02:42:41,500
And he was like, how is this happening?

3514
02:42:41,520 --> 02:42:43,060
He was like, how is this happening?

3515
02:42:43,060 --> 02:42:45,120
I used to be rank one.

3516
02:42:45,800 --> 02:42:46,520
And then...

3517
02:42:46,520 --> 02:42:49,880
Sekiro would like, type in the team chat, match chat, and be like...

3518
02:42:49,880 --> 02:42:51,920
All three of us used to be rank one.

3519
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:54,600
And then his friends were like, why are you adding yourself into this?

3520
02:42:54,660 --> 02:42:57,140
You've never been rank one before.

3521
02:43:00,360 --> 02:43:03,280
You're like, stop saying you're rank one.

3522
02:43:05,900 --> 02:43:09,060
And I remember that stream because it was literally like...

3523
02:43:09,980 --> 02:43:11,300
Like, I just couldn't...

3524
02:43:11,300 --> 02:43:12,600
It was literally like a car crash.

3525
02:43:13,340 --> 02:43:15,160
I don't even know if you got out of Cel...

3526
02:43:15,160 --> 02:43:16,800
I mean, clearly you got out of Celestial.

3527
02:43:17,240 --> 02:43:19,060
But like, I don't even know...

3528
02:43:20,300 --> 02:43:21,880
How long that took.

3529
02:43:23,940 --> 02:43:24,700
I am not...

3530
02:43:24,700 --> 02:43:25,980
Okay, I need to focus up.

3531
02:43:26,040 --> 02:43:26,500
Don't worry.

3532
02:43:27,080 --> 02:43:28,280
Don't worry, pizza.

3533
02:43:32,780 --> 02:43:34,300
Don't worry, Mr. Raccoon.

3534
02:43:34,580 --> 02:43:36,040
I miss every shot.

3535
02:43:39,260 --> 02:43:40,680
It's fine, he didn't though.

3536
02:43:41,360 --> 02:43:42,380
He didn't miss.

3537
02:43:43,060 --> 02:43:44,220
Oh, I knew he...

3538
02:43:44,220 --> 02:43:44,780
Look at that.

3539
02:43:45,600 --> 02:43:47,000
Don't worry, I save you.

3540
02:43:47,720 --> 02:43:49,060
I save...

3541
02:43:58,530 --> 02:44:02,450
He did not try to use the name for his cover.

3542
02:44:03,410 --> 02:44:05,310
I tried to jump up to it.

3543
02:44:06,830 --> 02:44:08,370
Bro was locked on.

3544
02:44:09,850 --> 02:44:11,030
Oh shit, okay.

3545
02:44:11,150 --> 02:44:11,670
He bounced.

3546
02:44:14,170 --> 02:44:16,390
Bro actually bounced a little bit.

3547
02:44:20,590 --> 02:44:21,170
Oh no.

3548
02:44:21,210 --> 02:44:22,170
Oh no.

3549
02:44:22,650 --> 02:44:24,450
He's going through a little gangbang right there.

3550
02:44:24,750 --> 02:44:25,870
Wait, and he's alive?

3551
02:44:27,010 --> 02:44:28,610
No, he's not alive.

3552
02:44:29,150 --> 02:44:29,730
He is...

3553
02:44:29,730 --> 02:44:30,170
He's...

3554
02:44:30,170 --> 02:44:32,230
There were five people on that man.

3555
02:44:32,470 --> 02:44:33,830
Oh my god.

3556
02:44:35,590 --> 02:44:38,450
There was actually five people on top of him.

3557
02:44:39,130 --> 02:44:40,150
That was crazy.

3558
02:44:45,760 --> 02:44:46,080
Okay.

3559
02:44:48,580 --> 02:44:50,740
I mean, we all watched it live.

3560
02:44:50,980 --> 02:44:51,580
Together.

3561
02:44:51,580 --> 02:44:53,000
What does that say about us?

3562
02:44:54,660 --> 02:44:56,740
It was like a little show for all of us.

3563
02:44:57,720 --> 02:44:58,700
All 3k of us.

3564
02:45:03,260 --> 02:45:04,500
I thought he was...

3565
02:45:04,500 --> 02:45:05,780
Oh my god, I love how...

3566
02:45:09,360 --> 02:45:09,880
Um...

3567
02:45:09,880 --> 02:45:10,760
Canon-wise...

3568
02:45:14,320 --> 02:45:16,580
About Mr. Fantastic...

3569
02:45:16,580 --> 02:45:18,500
He's like an actual freak.

3570
02:45:19,640 --> 02:45:20,680
He has it.

3571
02:45:22,940 --> 02:45:23,640
What?

3572
02:45:24,220 --> 02:45:25,140
It's true!

3573
02:45:25,520 --> 02:45:26,900
Oh, that's...

3574
02:45:26,900 --> 02:45:27,910
No way!

3575
02:45:28,480 --> 02:45:29,660
No way!

3576
02:45:31,840 --> 02:45:34,000
I thought I was so far.

3577
02:45:38,880 --> 02:45:40,440
I can't believe it.

3578
02:45:41,680 --> 02:45:42,500
We have...

3579
02:45:42,500 --> 02:45:43,900
Can we touch it?

3580
02:45:44,100 --> 02:45:44,640
Yeah, we can.

3581
02:45:45,540 --> 02:45:45,880
Nice.

3582
02:45:48,900 --> 02:45:49,600
Nice.

3583
02:45:49,900 --> 02:45:50,560
I'm going in.

3584
02:45:51,760 --> 02:45:52,460
Let's go!

3585
02:45:54,380 --> 02:45:54,900
Yeah.

3586
02:45:55,720 --> 02:45:56,440
Come on.

3587
02:45:57,400 --> 02:45:58,420
Nice, we did it.

3588
02:45:59,020 --> 02:46:00,120
Wait, that wasn't him.

3589
02:46:00,580 --> 02:46:00,980
That was...

3590
02:46:00,980 --> 02:46:01,260
Pizza!

3591
02:46:01,760 --> 02:46:02,560
Oh my god, please.

3592
02:46:02,940 --> 02:46:03,200
Please.

3593
02:46:03,520 --> 02:46:03,920
I swear.

3594
02:46:04,100 --> 02:46:05,040
Oh my god.

3595
02:46:05,160 --> 02:46:05,620
Thank god.

3596
02:46:05,700 --> 02:46:05,900
Okay.

3597
02:46:07,320 --> 02:46:08,360
Okay, it's fine.

3598
02:46:09,640 --> 02:46:10,380
It's fine.

3599
02:46:10,460 --> 02:46:10,920
He's gone.

3600
02:46:14,300 --> 02:46:15,320
Everything is fine.

3601
02:46:15,860 --> 02:46:17,800
I knew I could trust in my team.

3602
02:46:18,260 --> 02:46:19,240
The fear!

3603
02:46:20,400 --> 02:46:25,660
Look, after three slam dunks, I was worried he was gonna go LeBron on me again.

3604
02:46:27,340 --> 02:46:28,540
The pure terror.

3605
02:46:29,040 --> 02:46:30,800
Yeah, like, I don't know.

3606
02:46:30,900 --> 02:46:32,320
I think I have trust issues now.

3607
02:46:33,540 --> 02:46:34,600
Not gonna lie.

3608
02:46:36,160 --> 02:46:37,500
He definitely has slam.

3609
02:46:37,600 --> 02:46:38,740
I'm fucking backing up.

3610
02:46:38,920 --> 02:46:39,980
Oh no, not the cart.

3611
02:46:40,840 --> 02:46:41,560
Oh no.

3612
02:46:42,120 --> 02:46:42,400
Please.

3613
02:46:44,720 --> 02:46:45,280
Nice.

3614
02:46:45,880 --> 02:46:46,960
Our team is doing it.

3615
02:46:47,580 --> 02:46:48,380
It's fine.

3616
02:46:50,420 --> 02:46:51,540
Only now...

3617
02:46:51,540 --> 02:46:53,180
Well, sometimes, like...

3618
02:46:53,180 --> 02:46:56,540
Sometimes, I get to the phases where I was like...

3619
02:46:56,540 --> 02:46:57,900
I'm in an ELO where...

3620
02:46:57,900 --> 02:46:58,820
Goodbye.

3621
02:46:59,200 --> 02:47:00,620
I don't think you solved the problem.

3622
02:47:01,600 --> 02:47:02,140
Okay.

3623
02:47:03,340 --> 02:47:06,280
But you know, when you get into an ELO where you're like...

3624
02:47:06,280 --> 02:47:06,580
Alright.

3625
02:47:07,240 --> 02:47:08,120
My Magnetos.

3626
02:47:08,800 --> 02:47:10,440
Will save my life, right?

3627
02:47:10,640 --> 02:47:11,840
I was reloading.

3628
02:47:13,660 --> 02:47:14,500
But like...

3629
02:47:14,780 --> 02:47:16,040
Now I don't know.

3630
02:47:18,540 --> 02:47:19,460
Oh yeah, by the way.

3631
02:47:19,540 --> 02:47:21,040
You can reflect that as Vantas.

3632
02:47:21,520 --> 02:47:22,800
Oh, I timed that wrong.

3633
02:47:23,280 --> 02:47:24,440
I thought I timed that correctly.

3634
02:47:24,840 --> 02:47:25,820
Wait, that's not my Hella.

3635
02:47:27,140 --> 02:47:27,580
Whoops.

3636
02:47:34,070 --> 02:47:34,510
Alright.

3637
02:47:36,130 --> 02:47:37,290
I thought it was like...

3638
02:47:37,770 --> 02:47:38,210
Yippee!

3639
02:47:39,430 --> 02:47:42,770
My Hella's gonna protect me and I was gonna run straight to them.

3640
02:47:43,470 --> 02:47:43,790
Alright.

3641
02:47:46,290 --> 02:47:47,870
I was literally running to them.

3642
02:47:47,870 --> 02:47:49,470
Running straight at that enemy Hella.

3643
02:47:51,870 --> 02:47:53,290
Oh my god!

3644
02:47:53,910 --> 02:47:54,290
Bick!

3645
02:47:54,450 --> 02:47:56,610
Thank you for the 10 gifted subs!

3646
02:47:56,750 --> 02:47:58,010
Thank you, thank you!

3647
02:48:00,510 --> 02:48:01,890
I really appreciate it.

3648
02:48:01,930 --> 02:48:02,750
Thank you!

3649
02:48:05,410 --> 02:48:06,350
Everything is fine.

3650
02:48:08,650 --> 02:48:09,850
What's he gonna do?

3651
02:48:10,050 --> 02:48:10,970
I missed my freeze.

3652
02:48:11,150 --> 02:48:11,930
He's gonna do something.

3653
02:48:14,050 --> 02:48:17,550
I can't believe I missed the freeze on the most fucking tankiest guy ever.

3654
02:48:18,390 --> 02:48:19,710
He's so wide.

3655
02:48:23,540 --> 02:48:25,420
Fuck, I lagged a little bit.

3656
02:48:25,640 --> 02:48:27,960
He's gonna do something now.

3657
02:48:28,340 --> 02:48:29,340
He's like one.

3658
02:48:34,420 --> 02:48:35,660
Not enough.

3659
02:48:39,760 --> 02:48:40,400
Alright.

3660
02:48:43,040 --> 02:48:43,940
It's okay.

3661
02:48:44,080 --> 02:48:45,060
Everything is okay.

3662
02:48:45,360 --> 02:48:45,720
Look at that.

3663
02:48:45,780 --> 02:48:47,580
We have so much time over them.

3664
02:48:48,620 --> 02:48:50,800
Like, nothing bad's gonna happen.

3665
02:48:51,680 --> 02:48:56,000
Where is he go- Okay.

3666
02:48:56,460 --> 02:48:59,540
I realized, like, I need to stop playing with Fate.

3667
02:49:00,900 --> 02:49:01,120
Woo!

3668
02:49:03,600 --> 02:49:04,520
Let's go!

3669
02:49:05,260 --> 02:49:06,320
I can kill him too.

3670
02:49:07,820 --> 02:49:08,720
Look at that.

3671
02:49:09,040 --> 02:49:10,220
Wait, there's a Hella right here.

3672
02:49:10,340 --> 02:49:10,720
Get him!

3673
02:49:11,360 --> 02:49:12,080
Get him!

3674
02:49:13,400 --> 02:49:14,180
Oh no.

3675
02:49:14,580 --> 02:49:15,720
Oh, he has that.

3676
02:49:15,820 --> 02:49:16,640
He has that ult.

3677
02:49:17,160 --> 02:49:18,800
I can see it in his eyes.

3678
02:49:19,420 --> 02:49:20,540
He's going for it.

3679
02:49:20,640 --> 02:49:21,700
I'm fucking going backwards.

3680
02:49:22,520 --> 02:49:25,420
You can't get me if I'm 20 miles away from him.

3681
02:49:28,500 --> 02:49:35,900
I don't know why, but this game feels so- This match in particular feels incredibly slow.

3682
02:49:36,400 --> 02:49:41,560
I feel like we've been fighting for, like, 20-

3683
02:49:47,120 --> 02:49:48,380
There's nothing I can do.

3684
02:49:49,180 --> 02:49:51,100
There's nothing I can do.

3685
02:49:51,960 --> 02:49:53,900
I just- I just die.

3686
02:49:56,980 --> 02:49:57,780
I just die.

3687
02:49:58,480 --> 02:50:03,500
I look behind me.

3688
02:50:05,260 --> 02:50:07,260
And there was no other option.

3689
02:50:07,600 --> 02:50:08,580
Just dodge it.

3690
02:50:08,700 --> 02:50:10,460
Let me dodge a fucking- Oh!

3691
02:50:10,800 --> 02:50:12,060
What about the dinosaurs?

3692
02:50:12,460 --> 02:50:15,040
Did the dinosaurs fucking just dodge it?

3693
02:50:15,040 --> 02:50:15,840
Huh?

3694
02:50:19,640 --> 02:50:23,780
Were the dinosaurs able to just fucking dodge it?

3695
02:50:24,180 --> 02:50:26,160
What happened to the dinosaurs?

3696
02:50:29,420 --> 02:50:30,780
They could've.

3697
02:50:34,800 --> 02:50:39,860
Yeah, where did they- Why didn't they just fucking jump over the meteorite?

3698
02:50:40,140 --> 02:50:40,440
Huh?

3699
02:50:42,820 --> 02:50:43,920
Alright, let me see him.

3700
02:50:45,300 --> 02:50:48,100
Pizza's down to ruin someone's mental again.

3701
02:50:48,800 --> 02:50:51,060
Do you want to three stack?

3702
02:50:51,160 --> 02:50:55,080
Let's see how bruised Sakura's ego is if Pizza says no.

3703
02:50:57,480 --> 02:51:01,820
He's a masochist and likes being abused by you.

3704
02:51:07,340 --> 02:51:07,820
Oh, wait.

3705
02:51:08,200 --> 02:51:10,540
Ma- Masoch-

3706
02:51:14,360 --> 02:51:14,720
Sit.

3707
02:51:15,780 --> 02:51:17,180
What?

3708
02:51:18,240 --> 02:51:18,940
Okay.

3709
02:51:21,660 --> 02:51:23,600
Was it Sakura OW?

3710
02:51:24,340 --> 02:51:25,020
Okay.

3711
02:51:27,960 --> 02:51:28,980
Invite over.

3712
02:51:31,060 --> 02:51:31,760
Okay.

3713
02:51:32,480 --> 02:51:34,200
No shot.

3714
02:51:35,220 --> 02:51:35,660
Alright.

3715
02:51:46,380 --> 02:51:48,140
Why'd you do him like that?

3716
02:51:49,060 --> 02:51:52,120
I like how we had an insta-queue too.

3717
02:51:56,360 --> 02:51:58,760
I don't know how this is gonna go.

3718
02:51:59,820 --> 02:52:01,420
The only person not as main is Sakura.

3719
02:52:04,080 --> 02:52:05,980
Me and Pizza are just vibing.

3720
02:52:11,360 --> 02:52:12,000
Alright.

3721
02:52:13,500 --> 02:52:14,140
Banning.

3722
02:52:14,480 --> 02:52:15,660
I mean...

3723
02:52:15,660 --> 02:52:17,160
I'll just do Wolverine.

3724
02:52:18,280 --> 02:52:19,020
Alright, I'm gonna use the bathroom.

3725
02:52:19,100 --> 02:52:19,880
I'll be right back, guys.

3726
02:52:26,160 --> 02:52:27,180
Yeah, I'm not trolling, bro.

3727
02:52:27,240 --> 02:52:28,860
They got three fantastic players.

3728
02:52:29,860 --> 02:52:30,900
You gotta ban that, bro.

3729
02:52:59,350 --> 02:53:00,130
Oh my god.

3730
02:53:00,250 --> 02:53:01,430
Thanks for the 100 gifted, buddy.

3731
02:53:01,610 --> 02:53:02,010
Holy shit.

3732
02:53:09,220 --> 02:53:10,380
Well, not me, but...

3733
02:53:20,140 --> 02:53:21,700
Thanks for the 100 gifted!

3734
02:53:23,160 --> 02:53:23,880
Thank you!

3735
02:53:24,920 --> 02:53:25,640
Holy shit!

3736
02:53:26,840 --> 02:53:29,740
Wait, we banned MrFantastic?

3737
02:53:30,380 --> 02:53:31,200
Wait.

3738
02:53:31,920 --> 02:53:33,300
Holy shit.

3739
02:53:37,320 --> 02:53:39,960
Oh my god, thank you.

3740
02:53:39,960 --> 02:53:42,040
Thank you for the 100 gifted.

3741
02:53:43,080 --> 02:53:44,080
I don't think you...

3742
02:53:47,280 --> 02:53:48,920
It's looking crazy.

3743
02:53:49,780 --> 02:53:51,640
It's actually crazy.

3744
02:53:52,300 --> 02:53:53,820
But thank you so much!

3745
02:53:53,840 --> 02:53:55,100
I really appreciate it.

3746
02:53:55,100 --> 02:53:55,980
Thank you!

3747
02:53:58,060 --> 02:54:01,100
Well, Pizza tried to ban Groot.

3748
02:54:01,340 --> 02:54:02,440
Did it go through?

3749
02:54:03,880 --> 02:54:05,300
Hey, what were the bans?

3750
02:54:05,860 --> 02:54:07,740
Groot wasn't even banned!

3751
02:54:11,120 --> 02:54:11,440
Alright.

3752
02:54:12,280 --> 02:54:13,820
How the fuck did that happen?

3753
02:54:18,760 --> 02:54:19,720
Oh my god.

3754
02:54:22,280 --> 02:54:24,640
I mean, I'm just a support.

3755
02:54:24,860 --> 02:54:27,200
I'm a support player.

3756
02:54:29,400 --> 02:54:32,340
I just play any support that's meta because I'm a meta slave.

3757
02:54:32,840 --> 02:54:34,020
I literally...

3758
02:54:34,020 --> 02:54:35,040
Meta, I learn.

3759
02:54:37,260 --> 02:54:38,780
I have no free will.

3760
02:54:39,160 --> 02:54:42,380
My main SR gains.

3761
02:54:43,380 --> 02:54:45,180
I don't believe it.

3762
02:54:45,440 --> 02:54:46,340
What do you mean?!

3763
02:54:46,340 --> 02:54:47,900
Oh shit, okay.

3764
02:54:53,180 --> 02:54:53,580
Inspired?!

3765
02:54:57,100 --> 02:55:00,640
Oh my god, I have not seen Pizza on Punisher.

3766
02:55:00,840 --> 02:55:01,800
Oh wait, no I have.

3767
02:55:02,300 --> 02:55:02,880
I know I have.

3768
02:55:02,940 --> 02:55:03,900
I saw that in the...

3769
02:55:04,640 --> 02:55:05,940
In the sort of...

3770
02:55:05,940 --> 02:55:07,640
The only time I've seen it is they lost.

3771
02:55:08,120 --> 02:55:09,720
But like, this will be different.

3772
02:55:10,340 --> 02:55:11,740
The only person on their main is Sakura.

3773
02:55:12,040 --> 02:55:13,860
So like, we're losing nothing here.

3774
02:55:14,560 --> 02:55:16,140
Nothing is lost, technically.

3775
02:55:17,140 --> 02:55:18,820
If you think about it.

3776
02:55:20,780 --> 02:55:22,200
Nothing is lost.

3777
02:55:25,800 --> 02:55:26,060
Alright.

3778
02:55:26,880 --> 02:55:27,380
Nice.

3779
02:55:28,400 --> 02:55:29,620
Jesus Christ.

3780
02:55:29,960 --> 02:55:30,920
Oh my god.

3781
02:55:31,160 --> 02:55:32,340
Where's our mag?!

3782
02:55:32,340 --> 02:55:32,620
Oh!

3783
02:55:34,660 --> 02:55:35,720
It's okay.

3784
02:55:35,960 --> 02:55:36,980
Everything is okay.

3785
02:55:39,840 --> 02:55:40,600
Everything...

3786
02:55:40,600 --> 02:55:42,320
Oh my god, okay.

3787
02:55:42,880 --> 02:55:44,340
Nothing is okay anymore.

3788
02:55:44,340 --> 02:55:46,040
Wait, why did we use Namor?

3789
02:55:48,240 --> 02:55:50,940
How the fuck are we using Namor out there?

3790
02:55:52,100 --> 02:55:53,640
We could have damage boosted it.

3791
02:55:54,440 --> 02:55:55,380
Namor, no!

3792
02:55:56,060 --> 02:55:57,300
We could have been best friends.

3793
02:55:57,320 --> 02:55:58,000
Maybe he'll swap.

3794
02:55:58,140 --> 02:55:58,900
No, he's not swapping.

3795
02:55:58,980 --> 02:55:59,720
He's just stupid.

3796
02:56:02,380 --> 02:56:02,840
Alright.

3797
02:56:03,700 --> 02:56:04,480
I'll be fine.

3798
02:56:05,080 --> 02:56:06,120
I believe in Pizza.

3799
02:56:07,300 --> 02:56:08,480
I believe in him.

3800
02:56:10,120 --> 02:56:11,100
Where's our Namor?

3801
02:56:15,940 --> 02:56:17,300
Where's our...

3802
02:56:17,300 --> 02:56:18,840
I hear...

3803
02:56:18,840 --> 02:56:22,060
I hear the Hela right above me.

3804
02:56:23,400 --> 02:56:24,640
Is she dead?

3805
02:56:24,920 --> 02:56:25,420
Oh, she is.

3806
02:56:25,720 --> 02:56:25,880
Oh!

3807
02:56:26,320 --> 02:56:27,460
No way!

3808
02:56:27,900 --> 02:56:28,680
I'm a hero!

3809
02:56:29,760 --> 02:56:30,820
Let's go!

3810
02:56:32,740 --> 02:56:33,680
Let's go!

3811
02:56:34,920 --> 02:56:36,000
I'm still a hero!

3812
02:56:36,760 --> 02:56:37,820
Something will hap... okay.

3813
02:56:38,920 --> 02:56:39,960
I guess I die?

3814
02:56:41,100 --> 02:56:42,060
Oh no, I'm alive.

3815
02:56:43,680 --> 02:56:44,260
Hey guys?

3816
02:56:45,180 --> 02:56:47,900
I don't think the fantastic ban was it.

3817
02:56:53,180 --> 02:56:54,460
I'm not sure yet.

3818
02:56:55,900 --> 02:56:57,500
I'm not sure yet, guys.

3819
02:57:02,440 --> 02:57:03,020
Guys!

3820
02:57:14,450 --> 02:57:15,850
Oh man!

3821
02:57:16,790 --> 02:57:18,130
Is that karma?

3822
02:57:22,170 --> 02:57:23,770
It's okay.

3823
02:57:23,870 --> 02:57:24,770
I believe in Pizza.

3824
02:57:25,470 --> 02:57:26,950
Pizza, you got this Pizza.

3825
02:57:28,230 --> 02:57:29,730
You got this.

3826
02:57:30,410 --> 02:57:31,130
You were ranked...

3827
02:57:31,130 --> 02:57:32,170
You were a top 10.

3828
02:57:33,530 --> 02:57:35,090
You got this.

3829
02:57:35,630 --> 02:57:37,030
You were top 10.

3830
02:57:40,310 --> 02:57:41,510
You're locking!

3831
02:57:42,950 --> 02:57:43,910
Jesus Christ.

3832
02:57:44,030 --> 02:57:46,270
I am so scared right now.

3833
02:57:46,530 --> 02:57:46,830
Alright.

3834
02:57:48,750 --> 02:57:49,710
Jesus Christ.

3835
02:57:49,830 --> 02:57:50,530
I...

3836
02:57:50,530 --> 02:57:52,310
I can't!

3837
02:57:53,450 --> 02:57:54,750
Break my wrist.

3838
02:57:56,070 --> 02:57:57,770
Oh, I hear the Hela too.

3839
02:58:09,510 --> 02:58:11,570
I can't live!

3840
02:58:17,390 --> 02:58:19,170
It's so weird.

3841
02:58:22,150 --> 02:58:25,210
Why did they have all of the assaults?

3842
02:58:26,030 --> 02:58:27,070
Where are my...

3843
02:58:27,070 --> 02:58:29,630
Where are all of their ults?

3844
02:58:31,750 --> 02:58:32,970
Don't worry.

3845
02:58:33,550 --> 02:58:34,830
Don't worry, guys.

3846
02:58:37,430 --> 02:58:38,270
I...

3847
02:58:38,270 --> 02:58:40,910
I literally dodged like three...

3848
02:58:40,910 --> 02:58:43,250
Three different things at once.

3849
02:58:46,470 --> 02:58:49,310
Three real ones for once.

3850
02:58:53,110 --> 02:58:55,250
Yeah, I dodged the Hela.

3851
02:58:55,830 --> 02:58:57,110
Then there was the Maggot.

3852
02:58:58,310 --> 02:58:59,070
And...

3853
02:58:59,070 --> 02:59:02,050
And then I got hit by Namor.

3854
02:59:03,450 --> 02:59:06,170
What more do they want from me?

3855
02:59:06,990 --> 02:59:09,090
What more do they want?

3856
02:59:10,950 --> 02:59:12,290
Guys, it's holdable.

3857
02:59:12,750 --> 02:59:14,290
Guys, it's so holdable.

3858
02:59:18,790 --> 02:59:19,870
We got this.

3859
02:59:23,390 --> 02:59:27,090
Wait, wasn't Yunaim the one that got flamed by my entire...

3860
02:59:27,090 --> 02:59:27,850
By the...

3861
02:59:27,850 --> 02:59:30,210
By the enemy team last game?

3862
02:59:41,790 --> 02:59:43,710
Guys, this is about a street cred.

3863
02:59:44,830 --> 02:59:45,870
From a...

3864
02:59:45,870 --> 02:59:48,410
From an Iron Fist Fantastic player.

3865
02:59:49,350 --> 02:59:50,630
An academy girl.

3866
02:59:56,030 --> 02:59:57,230
Oh my god.

3867
02:59:57,390 --> 02:59:58,570
What's going on right now?

3868
02:59:58,650 --> 03:00:00,070
I'm a little...

3869
03:00:00,070 --> 03:00:03,190
Concerned about what's going on everywhere.

3870
03:00:04,230 --> 03:00:04,950
I'm a...

3871
03:00:06,010 --> 03:00:07,670
I'm a little concerned.

3872
03:00:08,550 --> 03:00:09,830
Okay, I...

3873
03:00:09,830 --> 03:00:11,270
I'm very concerned.

3874
03:00:11,670 --> 03:00:12,750
I'm very concerned.

3875
03:00:13,750 --> 03:00:14,470
I'm...

3876
03:00:15,490 --> 03:00:17,130
I'm very, very concerned.

3877
03:00:18,510 --> 03:00:18,990
Oh.

3878
03:00:19,430 --> 03:00:21,650
Guys, I don't think we're gonna live.

3879
03:00:21,770 --> 03:00:22,210
Guys.

3880
03:00:23,230 --> 03:00:23,950
Guys.

3881
03:00:24,750 --> 03:00:26,530
I'm so scared.

3882
03:00:28,930 --> 03:00:30,570
Guys, I'm so scared.

3883
03:00:31,510 --> 03:00:32,410
I almost had my ult.

3884
03:00:35,130 --> 03:00:36,170
Oh my god.

3885
03:00:36,410 --> 03:00:37,310
Don't worry.

3886
03:00:38,250 --> 03:00:39,710
We're gonna...

3887
03:00:47,560 --> 03:00:48,600
Guys.

3888
03:00:49,340 --> 03:00:50,380
Maybe...

3889
03:00:50,380 --> 03:00:51,860
Maybe...

3890
03:00:54,240 --> 03:00:55,280
Maybe...

3891
03:00:57,920 --> 03:01:00,540
That's not fantastic.

3892
03:01:04,540 --> 03:01:06,000
That was less fantastic.

3893
03:01:11,130 --> 03:01:11,670
Damn.

3894
03:01:12,810 --> 03:01:14,230
That was a little awkward there.

3895
03:01:15,390 --> 03:01:15,910
It's alright.

3896
03:01:16,870 --> 03:01:17,750
It's just...

3897
03:01:17,750 --> 03:01:18,650
It just wasn't it, guys.

3898
03:01:18,690 --> 03:01:20,610
We're figuring out the chemistry, guys.

3899
03:01:21,570 --> 03:01:24,170
We're just figuring out the chemistry.

3900
03:01:26,430 --> 03:01:27,350
It's okay.

3901
03:01:32,490 --> 03:01:33,610
The chemistry...

3902
03:01:33,610 --> 03:01:34,470
We'll get there.

3903
03:01:34,890 --> 03:01:35,190
Alright?

3904
03:01:35,570 --> 03:01:37,250
We're having the...

3905
03:01:37,250 --> 03:01:37,870
It's like...

3906
03:01:37,870 --> 03:01:38,810
It's like, you know...

3907
03:01:39,910 --> 03:01:41,490
It's like enemies to lovers.

3908
03:01:42,210 --> 03:01:43,030
Right now.

3909
03:01:43,590 --> 03:01:44,610
They're at the...

3910
03:01:44,610 --> 03:01:46,930
Pizza and Sakura are at the enemies phase.

3911
03:01:47,030 --> 03:01:48,190
But we'll slowly get there.

3912
03:01:48,190 --> 03:01:50,110
And then they'll be like BFFs.

3913
03:01:52,710 --> 03:01:54,130
It's our favorite trope.

3914
03:02:05,620 --> 03:02:07,040
Yeah, and then they'll be roommates.

3915
03:02:07,760 --> 03:02:08,880
I can see the vision.

3916
03:02:12,930 --> 03:02:14,190
Did all of us just forgot?

3917
03:02:14,470 --> 03:02:14,930
Oh, we don't.

3918
03:02:19,570 --> 03:02:22,830
I'm gonna banish.

3919
03:02:23,830 --> 03:02:24,270
Hi-ya!

3920
03:02:27,070 --> 03:02:28,590
Oh no, we have hella players.

3921
03:02:28,970 --> 03:02:30,970
Oh wait, this is practically the same team.

3922
03:02:34,860 --> 03:02:37,120
Oh, we got the same team.

3923
03:02:38,280 --> 03:02:39,280
We actually...

3924
03:02:39,280 --> 03:02:41,760
We actually got the same team.

3925
03:02:46,940 --> 03:02:47,440
Okay.

3926
03:02:50,340 --> 03:02:51,640
Then I don't know what to ban.

3927
03:02:51,700 --> 03:02:52,620
I guess I don't.

3928
03:02:53,280 --> 03:02:53,820
Fuck it.

3929
03:02:55,840 --> 03:02:57,280
This time it'll work, guys.

3930
03:02:58,260 --> 03:03:00,180
Maybe the enemy team will be easier now.

3931
03:03:02,280 --> 03:03:03,000
This is it.

3932
03:03:04,540 --> 03:03:06,460
No, it bugs out a lot.

3933
03:03:10,340 --> 03:03:11,100
It bugs out.

3934
03:03:11,140 --> 03:03:13,280
Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.

3935
03:03:13,900 --> 03:03:15,880
Oh my god, thank you for the raid money!

3936
03:03:16,160 --> 03:03:17,420
I really appreciate it.

3937
03:03:17,500 --> 03:03:18,640
Thank you, thank you.

3938
03:03:18,880 --> 03:03:20,040
Please let me play Loki.

3939
03:03:22,980 --> 03:03:24,140
Or I'll play Sue, actually.

3940
03:03:24,560 --> 03:03:25,860
I'll enable Pizza.

3941
03:03:27,440 --> 03:03:29,980
Oh, for those who don't know me, my name...

3942
03:03:31,100 --> 03:03:31,880
My name...

3943
03:03:31,880 --> 03:03:33,240
I forgot my own name.

3944
03:03:35,160 --> 03:03:37,440
My name is DokiBanon.

3945
03:03:37,520 --> 03:03:39,800
I usually stream on...

3946
03:03:39,800 --> 03:03:41,620
I used to stream on YouTube.

3947
03:03:41,820 --> 03:03:42,500
I almost said Twitch.

3948
03:03:42,820 --> 03:03:44,560
I'm deteriorating as a person.

3949
03:03:45,140 --> 03:03:53,520
I usually stream on YouTube, but now I'm here on Twitch for my Marvel Rivals quota.

3950
03:03:56,000 --> 03:03:57,060
Yeah, I'm DoeKitty.

3951
03:03:57,160 --> 03:03:58,360
You're right, I'm DoeKitty.

3952
03:03:59,220 --> 03:03:59,660
Today.

3953
03:04:00,980 --> 03:04:01,820
And then I'm going to be...

3954
03:04:01,820 --> 03:04:04,960
And then the moment the day is over, you're going to see me behind the farm.

3955
03:04:05,060 --> 03:04:07,780
Because they told me I'm going to get some special treats behind the farm.

3956
03:04:07,980 --> 03:04:09,900
And then I'm totally going to be okay.

3957
03:04:13,720 --> 03:04:14,160
No!

3958
03:04:15,800 --> 03:04:20,080
They said that I'm going to have the best day ever behind the farm.

3959
03:04:20,520 --> 03:04:21,500
I wonder what that'll be.

3960
03:04:28,400 --> 03:04:29,500
Alright, TP.

3961
03:04:34,070 --> 03:04:35,060
I'm so excited.

3962
03:04:35,660 --> 03:04:37,480
It's my first time at the farm.

3963
03:04:41,240 --> 03:04:41,940
Wow!

3964
03:04:43,420 --> 03:04:44,360
What the fuck?!

3965
03:04:45,180 --> 03:04:46,360
Where am I?!

3966
03:04:53,160 --> 03:04:55,360
Like, where did I go?!

3967
03:04:56,360 --> 03:05:00,020
What the fuck?!

3968
03:05:00,020 --> 03:05:00,920
Surprise!

3969
03:05:02,640 --> 03:05:04,540
I actually disappeared.

3970
03:05:06,120 --> 03:05:09,140
I was not expecting that.

3971
03:05:13,040 --> 03:05:14,020
That was crazy.

3972
03:05:15,320 --> 03:05:17,300
That was a wild ride.

3973
03:05:19,240 --> 03:05:22,140
I was like, what the fuck, where are they?

3974
03:05:22,140 --> 03:05:25,260
And then suddenly, there they are.

3975
03:05:27,180 --> 03:05:28,960
Jesus Christ, I'm sorry.

3976
03:05:30,540 --> 03:05:31,820
There's nothing I could do.

3977
03:05:31,960 --> 03:05:32,640
It was terminal.

3978
03:05:40,400 --> 03:05:41,260
Don't worry.

3979
03:05:42,160 --> 03:05:43,200
He'll be fine, right?

3980
03:05:43,420 --> 03:05:44,720
He was not fine, guys.

3981
03:05:45,280 --> 03:05:48,320
He was not fine.

3982
03:05:53,340 --> 03:06:01,500
Hey guys, remember when I said, don't worry, maybe it'll be better against this new team?

3983
03:06:04,480 --> 03:06:06,980
It doesn't look like it right now.

3984
03:06:10,320 --> 03:06:10,880
No,

3985
03:06:18,140 --> 03:06:19,320
you will not die!

3986
03:06:21,600 --> 03:06:22,760
What can I do?

3987
03:06:22,860 --> 03:06:24,140
I can't pull these guys.

3988
03:06:24,340 --> 03:06:25,640
It's a thing.

3989
03:06:27,180 --> 03:06:28,420
Wait, that's not fair.

3990
03:06:29,100 --> 03:06:30,240
He used a support ult.

3991
03:06:31,000 --> 03:06:32,060
That's cheating.

3992
03:06:34,440 --> 03:06:35,860
Don't worry, I got you.

3993
03:06:35,920 --> 03:06:36,480
I'm a hero.

3994
03:06:40,220 --> 03:06:41,500
I'm a fucking hero.

3995
03:06:44,220 --> 03:06:44,940
I got it.

3996
03:06:45,860 --> 03:06:46,460
Alright.

3997
03:06:48,260 --> 03:06:48,860
Guys,

3998
03:06:52,360 --> 03:06:56,700
I don't think I can play with another rocket one trick if I don't have a triple support.

3999
03:06:56,940 --> 03:06:58,900
I don't think I'm strong enough for this.

4000
03:07:03,560 --> 03:07:06,560
Guys, I don't think I'm strong enough.

4001
03:07:11,300 --> 03:07:14,000
I need another defensive ult.

4002
03:07:14,940 --> 03:07:15,660
What is that like?

4003
03:07:16,540 --> 03:07:19,660
What is that like to have two defensive ults?

4004
03:07:21,600 --> 03:07:22,780
Oh my god.

4005
03:07:25,520 --> 03:07:26,780
I did it!

4006
03:07:27,140 --> 03:07:28,960
He was on top of the stairs!

4007
03:07:31,620 --> 03:07:34,940
I was ready to push!

4008
03:07:39,760 --> 03:07:42,960
I was ready when the stairs went up.

4009
03:07:44,020 --> 03:07:46,100
I can't believe it!

4010
03:07:50,620 --> 03:07:52,320
Oh my god.

4011
03:07:52,440 --> 03:07:54,780
Wait, maybe Pizza is Mr. Fantastic.

4012
03:07:56,980 --> 03:07:58,920
I don't know how he does it though.

4013
03:08:00,180 --> 03:08:01,380
Look at you.

4014
03:08:01,600 --> 03:08:02,860
You go, buddy.

4015
03:08:04,980 --> 03:08:06,320
Look at you go.

4016
03:08:07,440 --> 03:08:08,480
Bro, he's him.

4017
03:08:08,720 --> 03:08:09,800
He's simply fantastic.

4018
03:08:10,720 --> 03:08:11,180
What's up?

4019
03:08:12,620 --> 03:08:13,420
Um...

4020
03:08:17,660 --> 03:08:18,460
Okay.

4021
03:08:28,480 --> 03:08:31,620
I have a feeling he has ult, guys.

4022
03:08:33,340 --> 03:08:34,420
Oh, nice.

4023
03:08:36,360 --> 03:08:37,480
Oh, nice.

4024
03:08:44,040 --> 03:08:45,000
Oh, unlucky.

4025
03:08:48,640 --> 03:08:49,360
It's fine.

4026
03:08:49,980 --> 03:08:51,220
I got a shield on him.

4027
03:08:54,220 --> 03:08:54,980
That's fucking right.

4028
03:08:55,000 --> 03:08:55,740
I'm gonna beat you up.

4029
03:08:59,760 --> 03:09:00,440
Wait, no.

4030
03:09:00,560 --> 03:09:02,840
We just... We just gotta kill the thing.

4031
03:09:03,280 --> 03:09:03,900
Here's the thing.

4032
03:09:04,580 --> 03:09:05,720
Wait, how is he still alive?

4033
03:09:06,880 --> 03:09:08,680
Oh my god.

4034
03:09:09,160 --> 03:09:09,640
Please.

4035
03:09:10,040 --> 03:09:11,080
Please kill him.

4036
03:09:11,300 --> 03:09:12,080
Please.

4037
03:09:12,820 --> 03:09:14,220
Please kill him.

4038
03:09:14,560 --> 03:09:15,660
Oh no.

4039
03:09:15,760 --> 03:09:17,860
They stalled it for so long.

4040
03:09:18,860 --> 03:09:20,100
I pushed him!

4041
03:09:20,680 --> 03:09:20,980
Yay!

4042
03:09:24,460 --> 03:09:26,140
I did it!

4043
03:09:30,390 --> 03:09:32,870
I finally know how to use my push.

4044
03:09:34,350 --> 03:09:35,550
See guys?

4045
03:09:35,910 --> 03:09:38,990
All I have to do is enable pizza.

4046
03:09:42,630 --> 03:09:44,350
That's all I have to do.

4047
03:09:47,850 --> 03:09:48,630
Wait.

4048
03:09:54,990 --> 03:09:56,550
Oh no.

4049
03:09:56,550 --> 03:09:59,930
Bro, you... Oh, things I wanna say.

4050
03:10:02,150 --> 03:10:03,190
Say it.

4051
03:10:03,430 --> 03:10:05,030
You sound worse than I do.

4052
03:10:05,170 --> 03:10:06,450
Who has a better voice?

4053
03:10:06,550 --> 03:10:07,630
Me or eating pizza?

4054
03:10:08,050 --> 03:10:08,930
Well, you are worse.

4055
03:10:09,330 --> 03:10:10,290
In every way.

4056
03:10:10,890 --> 03:10:12,590
This is... In what way?

4057
03:10:13,730 --> 03:10:15,210
Okay, same thing, bro.

4058
03:10:15,390 --> 03:10:17,110
Like, in what way am I worse than you?

4059
03:10:17,170 --> 03:10:17,910
Tell me, right now.

4060
03:10:18,690 --> 03:10:20,290
I can name one.

4061
03:10:22,070 --> 03:10:23,310
Uh, this game.

4062
03:10:23,310 --> 03:10:26,030
Oh, didn't pizza get top 10?

4063
03:10:26,810 --> 03:10:31,530
If I had 5 hours on any character you played, kid, I'd be so much better than you at it.

4064
03:10:31,570 --> 03:10:32,290
I swear to God.

4065
03:10:32,370 --> 03:10:33,150
Oh my goodness.

4066
03:10:35,470 --> 03:10:38,970
You give me 5 hours on your main, I'd be so much better than you at it.

4067
03:10:39,570 --> 03:10:40,590
I'm really, really sorry.

4068
03:10:43,890 --> 03:10:44,330
Damn!

4069
03:10:47,510 --> 03:10:47,570
Damn!

4070
03:10:52,150 --> 03:10:52,590
Why?

4071
03:10:53,230 --> 03:10:54,550
Stop fighting!

4072
03:10:55,490 --> 03:10:58,230
Why can't we be friends?

4073
03:10:58,370 --> 03:11:00,970
Why can't we be friends?

4074
03:11:01,070 --> 03:11:01,550
Why can't...

4075
03:11:03,810 --> 03:11:06,710
Yeah, I think we're definitely still in the enemy's phase.

4076
03:11:06,850 --> 03:11:07,990
But they're working together!

4077
03:11:20,490 --> 03:11:21,870
It's just that he...

4078
03:11:22,830 --> 03:11:26,030
Oh my God, I got... I got so scared.

4079
03:11:26,290 --> 03:11:29,390
I don't... I could not tell if we were gonna live or not.

4080
03:11:29,630 --> 03:11:30,450
I can't tell.

4081
03:11:32,010 --> 03:11:33,290
I can't tell.

4082
03:11:33,930 --> 03:11:35,890
I'm gonna stay invisible.

4083
03:11:38,390 --> 03:11:39,230
I can't.

4084
03:11:39,330 --> 03:11:39,790
I can't.

4085
03:11:39,890 --> 03:11:41,770
He shot randomly and it somehow got me.

4086
03:11:43,310 --> 03:11:45,770
How did he know?

4087
03:11:49,190 --> 03:11:50,870
How did he know?

4088
03:11:51,870 --> 03:11:53,050
I was invisible!

4089
03:11:56,030 --> 03:11:57,630
How did he know?

4090
03:11:58,170 --> 03:12:00,170
You're right, it's a slow burn right now.

4091
03:12:01,010 --> 03:12:01,350
Woah.

4092
03:12:02,090 --> 03:12:03,710
Do you guys see the tension?

4093
03:12:04,530 --> 03:12:06,050
When they're like...

4094
03:12:06,050 --> 03:12:09,090
Name one thing you're better than me and then Pizza was like...

4095
03:12:09,090 --> 03:12:10,030
This game.

4096
03:12:14,050 --> 03:12:14,730
Woah!

4097
03:12:17,910 --> 03:12:19,790
I love slow burn!

4098
03:12:21,890 --> 03:12:22,790
Hahaha!

4099
03:12:25,660 --> 03:12:26,470
Don't worry.

4100
03:12:27,870 --> 03:12:29,410
You just don't know it.

4101
03:12:30,290 --> 03:12:30,870
You don't know it.

4102
03:12:30,890 --> 03:12:32,170
They're gonna be like roommates.

4103
03:12:33,830 --> 03:12:34,210
How

4104
03:12:38,070 --> 03:12:40,970
did the punch change trajectory?!

4105
03:12:40,970 --> 03:12:41,870
Oh wait!

4106
03:12:42,370 --> 03:12:43,870
Holy shit!

4107
03:12:44,710 --> 03:12:46,970
The punch changed trajectory!

4108
03:12:47,950 --> 03:12:49,630
That should be impossible!

4109
03:12:50,630 --> 03:12:51,370
No!

4110
03:12:55,730 --> 03:12:56,930
Oh my god!

4111
03:12:57,150 --> 03:12:58,870
I went... I like...

4112
03:12:58,870 --> 03:13:01,690
Dropped down to the other side cause I was like...

4113
03:13:01,690 --> 03:13:03,230
I couldn't...

4114
03:13:03,230 --> 03:13:04,810
Didn't get me.

4115
03:13:05,510 --> 03:13:07,250
I even like... I like...

4116
03:13:07,250 --> 03:13:09,170
Went a different direction.

4117
03:13:11,270 --> 03:13:13,250
Oh my god.

4118
03:13:15,110 --> 03:13:16,030
That's crazy.

4119
03:13:19,530 --> 03:13:21,730
Control... Control F kiss.

4120
03:13:22,170 --> 03:13:23,530
That's my cheat sheet.

4121
03:13:23,530 --> 03:13:25,430
For those who wanna know.

4122
03:13:28,730 --> 03:13:30,890
This is the best I can do right now.

4123
03:13:32,250 --> 03:13:33,030
There you go.

4124
03:13:33,430 --> 03:13:35,350
I got it just in time.

4125
03:13:37,050 --> 03:13:38,990
I pulled him back a little bit.

4126
03:13:39,850 --> 03:13:40,370
Oh no.

4127
03:13:40,570 --> 03:13:41,970
He almost got it.

4128
03:13:44,900 --> 03:13:45,480
Don't worry.

4129
03:13:45,560 --> 03:13:45,800
I believe.

4130
03:13:47,020 --> 03:13:48,060
Oh my god!

4131
03:13:48,100 --> 03:13:48,300
Piss!

4132
03:13:48,400 --> 03:13:48,860
Oh nice!

4133
03:13:48,880 --> 03:13:49,280
We got it!

4134
03:13:49,340 --> 03:13:49,540
Okay.

4135
03:13:51,860 --> 03:13:52,180
Okay.

4136
03:13:56,400 --> 03:13:57,400
Oh nice!

4137
03:13:57,780 --> 03:13:58,900
He didn't know.

4138
03:14:01,640 --> 03:14:02,440
That's right.

4139
03:14:04,040 --> 03:14:04,640
They don't know.

4140
03:14:04,720 --> 03:14:06,140
They don't know I'm on the high ground.

4141
03:14:06,620 --> 03:14:07,560
Look at that.

4142
03:14:08,240 --> 03:14:09,320
They don't know.

4143
03:14:16,620 --> 03:14:17,100
Okay.

4144
03:14:17,100 --> 03:14:21,640
I see it.

4145
03:14:23,780 --> 03:14:24,980
Hey you too.

4146
03:14:25,060 --> 03:14:25,740
You too blue.

4147
03:14:25,860 --> 03:14:26,240
You too.

4148
03:14:34,280 --> 03:14:34,760
What?

4149
03:14:36,000 --> 03:14:36,860
They're not even close.

4150
03:14:36,860 --> 03:14:39,900
Bye bye!

4151
03:14:51,890 --> 03:14:53,010
They're five.

4152
03:14:57,730 --> 03:14:58,750
Oh I'm dead.

4153
03:14:59,350 --> 03:15:00,150
I'm so dead.

4154
03:15:00,730 --> 03:15:01,270
Oh no.

4155
03:15:01,390 --> 03:15:02,070
Do I get the rez?

4156
03:15:02,170 --> 03:15:02,930
I do!

4157
03:15:07,310 --> 03:15:08,430
Oh no.

4158
03:15:14,350 --> 03:15:14,910
No.

4159
03:15:15,170 --> 03:15:15,850
No I'm so close.

4160
03:15:16,330 --> 03:15:16,670
Yes!

4161
03:15:16,850 --> 03:15:17,670
I got it.

4162
03:15:18,090 --> 03:15:20,210
I got it in time but I don't know where.

4163
03:15:21,830 --> 03:15:22,490
I don't know.

4164
03:15:23,490 --> 03:15:24,050
Goodbye.

4165
03:15:24,490 --> 03:15:25,670
That's the GG's right now.

4166
03:15:27,390 --> 03:15:27,810
Yep.

4167
03:15:27,990 --> 03:15:28,310
Goodbye.

4168
03:15:32,970 --> 03:15:33,850
Oh shit.

4169
03:15:34,250 --> 03:15:34,570
Hello.

4170
03:15:35,070 --> 03:15:35,710
Oh no!

4171
03:15:36,030 --> 03:15:36,430
No!

4172
03:15:36,610 --> 03:15:38,430
You brought me back here to suffer!

4173
03:15:39,210 --> 03:15:41,730
I'm trying!

4174
03:15:44,570 --> 03:15:45,330
No.

4175
03:15:46,870 --> 03:15:47,110
No.

4176
03:15:48,970 --> 03:15:50,070
It's okay.

4177
03:15:52,070 --> 03:15:54,970
We just wanted to look at the portal a little closer.

4178
03:15:58,420 --> 03:15:59,580
It's okay.

4179
03:16:01,520 --> 03:16:04,600
I got rezzed back into the pit of hell.

4180
03:16:05,500 --> 03:16:12,080
I got rezzed back into the underworld.

4181
03:16:12,880 --> 03:16:15,380
Why would we be brought back?

4182
03:16:16,660 --> 03:16:18,340
I got a small taste of freedom.

4183
03:16:19,320 --> 03:16:20,480
And they're like, you know what?

4184
03:16:20,500 --> 03:16:21,720
This will change the game.

4185
03:16:22,340 --> 03:16:24,360
I wanna play Loki.

4186
03:16:27,320 --> 03:16:28,680
Not fair.

4187
03:16:35,560 --> 03:16:36,440
God bless.

4188
03:16:46,060 --> 03:16:49,100
Alright, this is it.

4189
03:16:53,200 --> 03:16:54,080
God bless.

4190
03:16:54,340 --> 03:16:55,260
Dude, talk to me.

4191
03:16:55,280 --> 03:16:57,260
How much damage do you have right now?

4192
03:16:58,080 --> 03:16:59,460
Uh, more than you would need.

4193
03:17:00,240 --> 03:17:00,980
How much?

4194
03:17:02,600 --> 03:17:03,480
22 games.

4195
03:17:04,000 --> 03:17:05,220
Oh my god, dude.

4196
03:17:05,420 --> 03:17:06,100
Wait, you're the dude?

4197
03:17:06,100 --> 03:17:07,520
Nevermind, you own me.

4198
03:17:10,520 --> 03:17:12,060
Oh my god, look at that.

4199
03:17:12,140 --> 03:17:13,480
See, he's starting to accept it.

4200
03:17:14,360 --> 03:17:15,560
He's starting to accept.

4201
03:17:18,260 --> 03:17:19,040
Oh my god.

4202
03:17:20,680 --> 03:17:21,020
Hello.

4203
03:17:21,780 --> 03:17:23,380
We're gonna be best friends, you and I.

4204
03:17:25,500 --> 03:17:27,200
It's fine, we're so healthy.

4205
03:17:30,120 --> 03:17:30,860
It's fine.

4206
03:17:31,820 --> 03:17:32,660
I'm a hero.

4207
03:17:36,100 --> 03:17:37,460
Bro, ever.

4208
03:17:41,220 --> 03:17:43,200
I'm a hero.

4209
03:17:43,780 --> 03:17:44,900
I live.

4210
03:17:52,840 --> 03:17:53,680
Okay,

4211
03:17:58,380 --> 03:17:59,200
I deserved that.

4212
03:17:59,920 --> 03:18:01,300
I left Loki.

4213
03:18:01,400 --> 03:18:02,720
I was like, you'll be fine.

4214
03:18:04,780 --> 03:18:08,600
Guys, maybe I shouldn't have left the Loki, guys.

4215
03:18:09,380 --> 03:18:10,900
Maybe I shouldn't have done that.

4216
03:18:15,260 --> 03:18:19,300
Alright, that's fine.

4217
03:18:20,380 --> 03:18:21,080
I'm invisible.

4218
03:18:21,360 --> 03:18:22,600
If she dies, I'm sorry.

4219
03:18:27,480 --> 03:18:28,320
Don't worry.

4220
03:18:28,980 --> 03:18:30,080
I'm a hero.

4221
03:18:31,070 --> 03:18:32,780
And I'll always be a hero.

4222
03:18:35,100 --> 03:18:36,960
I got this.

4223
03:18:38,680 --> 03:18:40,000
What the fuck?

4224
03:18:40,120 --> 03:18:40,880
How did I...

4225
03:18:40,880 --> 03:18:41,800
Okay, that's awkward.

4226
03:18:43,940 --> 03:18:45,100
That's awkward.

4227
03:18:46,810 --> 03:18:49,080
He definitely has...

4228
03:18:49,720 --> 03:18:52,080
I know he has...

4229
03:18:53,380 --> 03:18:54,580
Oh my god, what?

4230
03:18:55,840 --> 03:18:57,620
It was on damage!

4231
03:18:58,760 --> 03:18:59,700
What?

4232
03:19:04,240 --> 03:19:08,180
I was like, wait a minute.

4233
03:19:08,500 --> 03:19:09,940
I'm not getting healed.

4234
03:19:10,380 --> 03:19:11,900
From the ult.

4235
03:19:12,380 --> 03:19:14,560
Wait a minute.

4236
03:19:17,430 --> 03:19:18,980
I was like, wait.

4237
03:19:20,380 --> 03:19:22,260
That's weird.

4238
03:19:24,680 --> 03:19:26,240
Wait, no.

4239
03:19:26,240 --> 03:19:28,000
He wants to...

4240
03:19:28,000 --> 03:19:30,720
That Loki wants to be a hero too.

4241
03:19:31,000 --> 03:19:32,940
But there can only be one hero.

4242
03:19:34,600 --> 03:19:35,860
I didn't know he was gonna do that.

4243
03:19:36,400 --> 03:19:40,480
The moment I saw the fucking Sylas, I fucking ran in there like that.

4244
03:19:41,300 --> 03:19:41,980
I don't know.

4245
03:19:42,020 --> 03:19:43,360
I don't know if we could have stacked it.

4246
03:19:43,380 --> 03:19:45,140
We could have stacked it, I think.

4247
03:19:45,740 --> 03:19:48,720
I think we could have stacked it, but...

4248
03:19:50,020 --> 03:19:53,300
Okay, I think it's time.

4249
03:19:54,160 --> 03:19:55,720
I think it's time.

4250
03:19:59,860 --> 03:20:00,460
Okay,

4251
03:20:05,880 --> 03:20:06,040
heal.

4252
03:20:11,430 --> 03:20:12,730
Oh, we're so dead.

4253
03:20:16,890 --> 03:20:19,250
Oh my god, there was no living that.

4254
03:20:22,490 --> 03:20:24,670
Guys, I did my best.

4255
03:20:26,490 --> 03:20:26,630
No.

4256
03:20:29,810 --> 03:20:31,090
Okay, I...

4257
03:20:32,290 --> 03:20:33,930
I think like...

4258
03:20:34,490 --> 03:20:37,550
We definitely should not have ran Rocket there in the beginning.

4259
03:20:50,560 --> 03:20:52,900
It's okay, the next game will be different.

4260
03:20:54,400 --> 03:20:57,380
The next game will be different, guys.

4261
03:20:57,460 --> 03:20:57,980
It's okay.

4262
03:20:57,980 --> 03:20:59,100
I believe.

4263
03:21:03,030 --> 03:21:04,050
I believe.

4264
03:21:04,810 --> 03:21:06,250
I'm gonna avoid because I don't wanna...

4265
03:21:06,250 --> 03:21:10,310
I cannot have a Rocket player if we're not running triple support.

4266
03:21:10,690 --> 03:21:12,240
There's no reason to...

4267
03:21:13,130 --> 03:21:13,610
Oh!

4268
03:21:13,950 --> 03:21:15,930
Oh wait, Taco's done.

4269
03:21:17,670 --> 03:21:18,830
Taco's done.

4270
03:21:19,230 --> 03:21:21,690
He's like, it's over.

4271
03:21:23,670 --> 03:21:26,330
Taco, go away.

4272
03:21:26,330 --> 03:21:26,850
Wait, what?

4273
03:21:29,490 --> 03:21:31,570
Oh wait, yum yum yum yum yum.

4274
03:21:32,470 --> 03:21:33,070
GG's.

4275
03:21:33,490 --> 03:21:38,370
The problem left me with...

4276
03:21:40,450 --> 03:21:44,390
Okay, I'll do one more game.

4277
03:21:45,390 --> 03:21:47,570
And then I'll GG.

4278
03:21:48,210 --> 03:21:49,250
Yum yum yum yum yum.

4279
03:21:51,810 --> 03:21:53,270
I'll do one last game.

4280
03:21:54,330 --> 03:21:55,950
I need to eat a fish every time.

4281
03:21:58,510 --> 03:21:59,530
Every time.

4282
03:22:00,090 --> 03:22:01,350
I need to eat a fish.

4283
03:22:24,790 --> 03:22:26,290
Alright, this time.

4284
03:22:26,690 --> 03:22:27,650
Fish equals win?

4285
03:22:28,170 --> 03:22:30,810
No, I'll eat it for a little bit and then...

4286
03:22:30,810 --> 03:22:31,770
I think...

4287
03:22:31,770 --> 03:22:33,230
That was crazy though.

4288
03:22:33,490 --> 03:22:33,770
Win.

4289
03:22:39,830 --> 03:22:41,070
Let's secure it.

4290
03:22:43,370 --> 03:22:45,590
Made like a sly comment.

4291
03:22:46,350 --> 03:22:47,330
To other support.

4292
03:22:48,110 --> 03:22:50,810
And he's just like, never mind.

4293
03:22:51,170 --> 03:22:51,510
Nothing.

4294
03:22:53,290 --> 03:22:54,730
I think Taco went to bed.

4295
03:22:54,930 --> 03:22:55,510
Oh sorry, Pizza.

4296
03:22:56,110 --> 03:22:57,170
Pizza went to bed.

4297
03:23:02,640 --> 03:23:03,500
I'm pretty sure.

4298
03:23:10,200 --> 03:23:11,860
Abandoned her like...

4299
03:23:14,400 --> 03:23:15,400
What is it?

4300
03:23:17,460 --> 03:23:19,100
Abandoned her like...

4301
03:23:19,100 --> 03:23:19,820
Twice?

4302
03:23:20,300 --> 03:23:20,840
I think?

4303
03:23:21,880 --> 03:23:24,840
One was on purpose because I thought it was funny.

4304
03:23:33,120 --> 03:23:35,300
But also she was on rocket.

4305
03:23:36,760 --> 03:23:39,660
Rocket is like so easy to not kill.

4306
03:23:41,220 --> 03:23:44,440
If I sacrifice my life for a rocket, I die.

4307
03:23:52,380 --> 03:23:53,660
Because like...

4308
03:23:54,400 --> 03:23:58,660
It's harder for the rocket to pocket the other support versus...

4309
03:24:03,260 --> 03:24:04,380
Versus like...

4310
03:24:05,580 --> 03:24:07,280
Rocket pocketing the other support.

4311
03:24:07,960 --> 03:24:10,660
I have so many instances where...

4312
03:24:12,200 --> 03:24:14,860
The rocket just has to like...

4313
03:24:14,860 --> 03:24:15,980
Have really good movement.

4314
03:24:18,020 --> 03:24:19,280
Yeah, if I sacrifice...

4315
03:24:19,280 --> 03:24:19,980
I did it!

4316
03:24:20,060 --> 03:24:22,480
I tried to sacrifice my life and I died.

4317
03:24:22,480 --> 03:24:24,360
And then I was like...

4318
03:24:24,360 --> 03:24:25,560
I learned my lesson.

4319
03:24:36,850 --> 03:24:37,250
Alright.

4320
03:24:37,990 --> 03:24:38,690
Let's see.

4321
03:24:41,170 --> 03:24:41,710
I don't know.

4322
03:24:41,730 --> 03:24:44,130
I don't think I've ever had to save a rocket before.

4323
03:24:46,630 --> 03:24:47,870
I'm like trying to...

4324
03:24:50,250 --> 03:24:50,830
Let's see.

4325
03:24:50,870 --> 03:24:52,910
I'm trying to think of when I have to save a rocket.

4326
03:25:01,980 --> 03:25:02,500
Alright.

4327
03:25:02,860 --> 03:25:04,900
No matter what happens...

4328
03:25:04,900 --> 03:25:05,780
This is LG.

4329
03:25:08,420 --> 03:25:11,160
Yeah, if a rocket needs saving, that's a problem.

4330
03:25:22,590 --> 03:25:23,110
Yay!

4331
03:25:23,370 --> 03:25:24,370
I can play Loki!

4332
03:25:26,390 --> 03:25:28,490
But no, this is my LG for the day.

4333
03:25:28,790 --> 03:25:29,770
No matter what.

4334
03:25:30,110 --> 03:25:31,470
I was gonna call that one LG.

4335
03:25:42,140 --> 03:25:42,580
Yay!

4336
03:25:42,700 --> 03:25:44,020
I get to play Loki!

4337
03:25:46,460 --> 03:25:47,180
I don't know.

4338
03:25:47,280 --> 03:25:48,980
I just don't like it when people force rocket.

4339
03:25:49,840 --> 03:25:51,000
Especially in this ELO.

4340
03:25:51,200 --> 03:25:52,540
If it was higher ELO, I understand.

4341
03:25:53,900 --> 03:25:54,400
But like...

4342
03:25:54,400 --> 03:25:56,260
In this ELO...

4343
03:25:56,260 --> 03:25:58,020
I don't like it because like...

4344
03:25:58,020 --> 03:26:00,400
People don't understand how to actually properly play him.

4345
03:26:01,680 --> 03:26:03,660
To utilize him where he's actually good now.

4346
03:26:05,660 --> 03:26:07,080
As double support.

4347
03:26:07,780 --> 03:26:09,820
If you utilize him as a triple support, I'm fine.

4348
03:26:09,820 --> 03:26:11,060
I don't give a fuck.

4349
03:26:11,780 --> 03:26:14,080
But the enemy team had two defensive ults.

4350
03:26:25,160 --> 03:26:26,520
There's a way to high skill...

4351
03:26:26,520 --> 03:26:26,700
Yeah.

4352
03:26:26,960 --> 03:26:27,880
There's a...

4353
03:26:27,880 --> 03:26:30,280
There's a way to high skill...

4354
03:26:31,160 --> 03:26:32,420
High skill rocket.

4355
03:26:32,980 --> 03:26:33,860
But I've only...

4356
03:26:34,620 --> 03:26:37,080
The only good rocket players I know are not rocket mains.

4357
03:26:37,340 --> 03:26:38,140
They're support players.

4358
03:26:38,140 --> 03:26:39,420
They're support players.

4359
03:26:40,640 --> 03:26:41,420
Okay, I was gonna say...

4360
03:26:41,420 --> 03:26:42,180
Did we break the glass?

4361
03:26:47,700 --> 03:26:49,230
I was gonna say...

4362
03:26:49,720 --> 03:26:52,560
That would be so awkward if we broke the glass there.

4363
03:26:53,000 --> 03:26:53,240
Oh.

4364
03:26:54,700 --> 03:26:55,280
There.

4365
03:26:57,600 --> 03:26:58,180
Okay.

4366
03:26:59,220 --> 03:26:59,880
Oh, fuck.

4367
03:26:59,980 --> 03:27:00,200
Okay.

4368
03:27:02,200 --> 03:27:02,780
My...

4369
03:27:02,780 --> 03:27:04,200
Oh, no!

4370
03:27:05,380 --> 03:27:07,580
My Loki clone didn't put forward!

4371
03:27:08,140 --> 03:27:11,520
I was trying to put my Loki clone up and it didn't register!

4372
03:27:12,040 --> 03:27:12,540
No!

4373
03:27:14,860 --> 03:27:17,500
My Loki clone didn't register!

4374
03:27:20,140 --> 03:27:22,300
Yeah, just having one defensive ult is really rough.

4375
03:27:23,360 --> 03:27:25,360
It'd be fun if we had a...

4376
03:27:25,360 --> 03:27:28,140
Bucky and Punisher, but I don't think...

4377
03:27:32,020 --> 03:27:32,760
It's okay.

4378
03:27:33,040 --> 03:27:34,200
He's the only one that's on his main.

4379
03:27:35,140 --> 03:27:35,660
And I'm okay.

4380
03:27:36,200 --> 03:27:37,280
What the fuck?

4381
03:27:38,260 --> 03:27:39,380
Who was that?

4382
03:27:40,780 --> 03:27:41,780
I wasn't paying attention.

4383
03:27:44,680 --> 03:27:46,580
That was... Whoa, hey!

4384
03:27:47,460 --> 03:27:48,140
Yay!

4385
03:27:53,300 --> 03:27:54,460
Oh, not yet!

4386
03:27:54,600 --> 03:27:54,980
Not yet!

4387
03:27:57,840 --> 03:27:58,880
Not yet!

4388
03:27:59,000 --> 03:27:59,160
Yay!

4389
03:28:00,180 --> 03:28:01,180
Not yet.

4390
03:28:01,580 --> 03:28:02,160
Not yet.

4391
03:28:04,780 --> 03:28:05,460
Yay!

4392
03:28:05,460 --> 03:28:05,720
Yay!

4393
03:28:06,680 --> 03:28:08,260
I went through, like, the five stages.

4394
03:28:08,940 --> 03:28:11,140
I went through, like, so many motions there.

4395
03:28:12,380 --> 03:28:15,120
I went through so many motions.

4396
03:28:17,200 --> 03:28:17,840
Oh, man.

4397
03:28:19,680 --> 03:28:21,060
I just didn't know how to feel.

4398
03:28:26,720 --> 03:28:27,160
Okay.

4399
03:28:28,200 --> 03:28:29,200
Don't worry, I got you!

4400
03:28:32,500 --> 03:28:33,380
Oh, shit.

4401
03:28:33,480 --> 03:28:33,700
Okay.

4402
03:28:37,500 --> 03:28:38,400
Oh, shit.

4403
03:28:41,100 --> 03:28:41,940
Okay.

4404
03:28:43,340 --> 03:28:44,080
That's good.

4405
03:28:46,340 --> 03:28:47,480
That's okay.

4406
03:28:50,320 --> 03:28:51,060
That's okay.

4407
03:28:52,360 --> 03:28:53,460
That's okay.

4408
03:28:56,280 --> 03:28:59,100
Oh, no.

4409
03:29:00,380 --> 03:29:03,200
Oh, I got fucking flew up.

4410
03:29:03,740 --> 03:29:05,120
I got flew up!

4411
03:29:05,160 --> 03:29:05,900
I'm sorry!

4412
03:29:09,020 --> 03:29:11,960
I was flew up into the air!

4413
03:29:15,360 --> 03:29:16,840
Is that a new account?

4414
03:29:17,160 --> 03:29:21,260
I'm getting question marks by AvaFPS because she hit the roller slow walk on me.

4415
03:29:21,400 --> 03:29:23,040
It's like fucking crip walk that I missed.

4416
03:29:28,020 --> 03:29:28,880
Oh, my... Whoa!

4417
03:29:29,620 --> 03:29:30,500
Whoa, unlucky.

4418
03:29:32,220 --> 03:29:33,300
This pal is good.

4419
03:29:33,340 --> 03:29:34,200
I can't ego her.

4420
03:29:34,800 --> 03:29:36,180
I need to stop egoing her.

4421
03:29:36,180 --> 03:29:37,580
Oh, my God.

4422
03:29:37,680 --> 03:29:38,440
You can tell like...

4423
03:29:39,120 --> 03:29:41,040
Knight is... I'm getting tired.

4424
03:29:43,920 --> 03:29:47,280
You can tell... I'm definitely getting tired now.

4425
03:29:49,920 --> 03:29:54,260
That's why I was letting this potentially pass to be last game.

4426
03:29:58,300 --> 03:29:59,260
Oh, my God.

4427
03:29:59,340 --> 03:30:00,660
What am I getting hit by?

4428
03:30:02,300 --> 03:30:04,540
Yeah, my battery is flashing red.

4429
03:30:05,220 --> 03:30:05,860
What?

4430
03:30:09,540 --> 03:30:11,780
That was 200 things.

4431
03:30:11,960 --> 03:30:12,080
Wait.

4432
03:30:13,420 --> 03:30:14,520
I'm a hero.

4433
03:30:14,900 --> 03:30:16,100
Did you see that?

4434
03:30:16,300 --> 03:30:19,480
They were all red and then they were not.

4435
03:30:20,820 --> 03:30:21,700
Did you see that?

4436
03:30:24,060 --> 03:30:26,540
They were all red and then suddenly...

4437
03:30:28,360 --> 03:30:29,280
Oh, my God.

4438
03:30:29,340 --> 03:30:30,420
I'm actually a hero.

4439
03:30:31,740 --> 03:30:33,140
Okay, she dodged it.

4440
03:30:34,540 --> 03:30:35,140
No.

4441
03:30:35,260 --> 03:30:36,900
Oh, my God.

4442
03:30:37,600 --> 03:30:38,480
I can't peek her.

4443
03:30:40,260 --> 03:30:40,560
No.

4444
03:30:40,960 --> 03:30:41,460
Oh, fuck.

4445
03:30:41,560 --> 03:30:41,700
Okay.

4446
03:30:42,660 --> 03:30:43,040
Okay.

4447
03:30:43,420 --> 03:30:44,140
That was scary.

4448
03:30:44,480 --> 03:30:45,220
That was actually scary.

4449
03:30:48,520 --> 03:30:49,280
Oh, my God.

4450
03:30:50,480 --> 03:30:51,680
This is scary.

4451
03:30:55,260 --> 03:30:56,360
Oh, my God.

4452
03:30:56,480 --> 03:30:57,060
What?

4453
03:30:57,140 --> 03:30:59,420
How am I getting hit by that?

4454
03:31:01,820 --> 03:31:02,620
I don't know.

4455
03:31:02,920 --> 03:31:04,440
I don't know how I'm getting hit.

4456
03:31:08,830 --> 03:31:11,130
I literally don't even see the mag.

4457
03:31:11,790 --> 03:31:12,930
When it happens.

4458
03:31:13,170 --> 03:31:14,030
Or maybe I'm tired.

4459
03:31:18,310 --> 03:31:19,730
I don't even see the mag.

4460
03:31:19,910 --> 03:31:20,070
Alright.

4461
03:31:21,150 --> 03:31:21,810
Oh, no.

4462
03:31:22,590 --> 03:31:23,130
Oh, no.

4463
03:31:27,050 --> 03:31:27,550
Yeah.

4464
03:31:27,950 --> 03:31:29,230
That was my bad.

4465
03:31:29,530 --> 03:31:30,790
I did not see him.

4466
03:31:31,330 --> 03:31:32,150
That's okay.

4467
03:31:33,310 --> 03:31:35,010
You're on your main.

4468
03:31:35,350 --> 03:31:36,730
I'm not.

4469
03:31:58,070 --> 03:31:59,450
I'm chilling.

4470
03:32:03,350 --> 03:32:04,430
Oh, okay.

4471
03:32:07,890 --> 03:32:10,290
Don't keep playing with me.

4472
03:32:11,990 --> 03:32:19,610
I'm just surprised you're running Moon Knight.

4473
03:32:22,050 --> 03:32:25,010
I'm trying to keep you up right now.

4474
03:32:31,060 --> 03:32:31,900
Alright.

4475
03:32:32,640 --> 03:32:33,020
Doing good.

4476
03:32:36,460 --> 03:32:37,180
Reload.

4477
03:32:37,200 --> 03:32:37,540
Fuck.

4478
03:32:40,720 --> 03:32:42,160
Jesus Christ.

4479
03:32:42,920 --> 03:32:44,460
I have to reload.

4480
03:32:49,500 --> 03:32:50,220
Jesus.

4481
03:32:51,260 --> 03:32:51,920
Please.

4482
03:32:53,540 --> 03:32:54,260
Please.

4483
03:32:54,540 --> 03:32:56,080
Oh, my God.

4484
03:32:56,920 --> 03:32:57,760
You think they're okay?

4485
03:32:58,580 --> 03:33:00,220
I don't think they're okay.

4486
03:33:01,000 --> 03:33:03,320
I don't know if they're okay.

4487
03:33:07,340 --> 03:33:10,020
Guys, I don't think they're okay, guys.

4488
03:33:11,320 --> 03:33:12,360
I have my ult soon, though.

4489
03:33:14,120 --> 03:33:14,720
Yippee!

4490
03:33:16,340 --> 03:33:17,520
Nah, yippee.

4491
03:33:19,100 --> 03:33:20,340
Nah, yippee.

4492
03:33:20,980 --> 03:33:22,120
Oh, absolutely.

4493
03:33:22,420 --> 03:33:24,100
I'm not feeling yippees anymore.

4494
03:33:27,300 --> 03:33:28,260
It's okay.

4495
03:33:28,660 --> 03:33:29,220
Yippee?

4496
03:33:29,520 --> 03:33:29,820
Time?

4497
03:33:32,740 --> 03:33:34,240
Is it yippee time?

4498
03:33:35,920 --> 03:33:36,640
Oh, my God.

4499
03:33:36,740 --> 03:33:36,960
Please.

4500
03:33:41,240 --> 03:33:42,380
Oh, my God.

4501
03:33:42,520 --> 03:33:42,800
Please.

4502
03:33:44,220 --> 03:33:45,180
Oh, please.

4503
03:33:47,000 --> 03:33:47,940
I have no DPS.

4504
03:33:49,220 --> 03:33:49,700
Alright.

4505
03:33:51,160 --> 03:33:51,920
Where is it?

4506
03:33:53,980 --> 03:33:55,100
Oh, here you go.

4507
03:34:00,220 --> 03:34:01,360
There you go.

4508
03:34:01,480 --> 03:34:02,120
I saved you.

4509
03:34:02,280 --> 03:34:02,660
You're welcome.

4510
03:34:02,660 --> 03:34:03,180
You're welcome.

4511
03:34:04,320 --> 03:34:05,480
I saved you.

4512
03:34:05,620 --> 03:34:06,040
You're welcome.

4513
03:34:07,300 --> 03:34:09,500
I'm still trying to save you right now.

4514
03:34:10,020 --> 03:34:10,900
Please, please.

4515
03:34:12,470 --> 03:34:13,960
I'm trying to save you.

4516
03:34:14,140 --> 03:34:15,700
They're still stalling.

4517
03:34:16,560 --> 03:34:17,460
Oh, my God.

4518
03:34:17,580 --> 03:34:18,240
I hate you.

4519
03:34:23,240 --> 03:34:24,890
Are they still...

4520
03:34:25,660 --> 03:34:26,320
Please.

4521
03:34:27,140 --> 03:34:28,660
Oh, my God.

4522
03:34:28,660 --> 03:34:33,220
Oh, my goodness.

4523
03:34:35,520 --> 03:34:36,580
Bro, I can't kill anything.

4524
03:34:39,740 --> 03:34:41,400
Nobody killed the thing.

4525
03:34:41,500 --> 03:34:41,920
It's crazy.

4526
03:34:43,020 --> 03:34:44,480
It's actually crazy.

4527
03:34:44,680 --> 03:34:45,660
We could shoot a rocket.

4528
03:34:46,640 --> 03:34:47,860
Holy shit, bro.

4529
03:34:48,280 --> 03:34:50,180
Eating pizza just owns me.

4530
03:34:50,260 --> 03:34:50,900
I give up, bro.

4531
03:34:53,940 --> 03:34:58,040
Well, you can't expect to win at all.

4532
03:34:59,200 --> 03:35:02,300
I think it's over for that man.

4533
03:35:03,200 --> 03:35:04,720
I think it's over.

4534
03:35:09,380 --> 03:35:11,060
That's fucking hilarious.

4535
03:35:16,620 --> 03:35:19,520
He's finally admitted it this time.

4536
03:35:22,940 --> 03:35:23,620
Alright.

4537
03:35:24,740 --> 03:35:26,020
Time to head to the bar.

4538
03:35:26,180 --> 03:35:26,720
You're right.

4539
03:35:26,880 --> 03:35:27,360
It's time.

4540
03:35:27,360 --> 03:35:29,060
It's time to head to the bar.

4541
03:35:29,100 --> 03:35:30,440
I told you, guys.

4542
03:35:31,540 --> 03:35:32,520
I told you.

4543
03:35:33,140 --> 03:35:34,020
I knew what I was...

4544
03:35:34,020 --> 03:35:37,640
I knew what I was gonna get into the moment I get out of solo queue.

4545
03:35:37,880 --> 03:35:41,140
I knew exactly what was gonna happen.

4546
03:35:45,400 --> 03:35:46,960
I was like...

4547
03:35:46,960 --> 03:35:50,900
I was like, okay, the moment I get out of solo queue, it's gonna be a wild ride.

4548
03:35:51,340 --> 03:35:53,360
I was not there to climb.

4549
03:35:53,940 --> 03:35:54,360
I...

4550
03:35:54,360 --> 03:35:55,740
I was...

4551
03:35:55,740 --> 03:35:57,060
I was not...

4552
03:35:57,060 --> 03:35:58,860
I was not there to climb anymore.

4553
03:35:59,300 --> 03:36:00,580
The moment I went there.

4554
03:36:02,660 --> 03:36:05,840
But I had a great solo queue adventure, though.

4555
03:36:06,460 --> 03:36:09,300
An incredible solo queue adventure.

4556
03:36:11,460 --> 03:36:13,660
Yeah, we traded wins for content.

4557
03:36:13,920 --> 03:36:15,060
Exactly, guys.

4558
03:36:15,140 --> 03:36:15,700
Exactly.

4559
03:36:16,040 --> 03:36:18,180
We got lots of wins from that.

4560
03:36:18,560 --> 03:36:21,680
We got lots of wins and then we got content.

4561
03:36:21,820 --> 03:36:24,020
We got the best of both worlds, chat.

4562
03:36:25,560 --> 03:36:26,760
Did we climb today?

4563
03:36:27,040 --> 03:36:27,660
We went up.

4564
03:36:28,060 --> 03:36:29,220
We were climbing.

4565
03:36:34,480 --> 03:36:36,020
And then I...

4566
03:36:36,020 --> 03:36:38,160
I started stacking.

4567
03:36:40,780 --> 03:36:42,320
But we had fun.

4568
03:36:42,560 --> 03:36:43,080
We had fun.

4569
03:36:43,340 --> 03:36:45,300
This account is not about...

4570
03:36:45,300 --> 03:36:47,900
This account is not about trying to get as high as we can.

4571
03:36:48,020 --> 03:36:49,100
It's about...

4572
03:36:49,100 --> 03:36:51,320
It's about having fun.

4573
03:36:54,020 --> 03:36:55,120
One final...

4574
03:36:55,120 --> 03:36:56,020
Do I do one?

4575
03:36:56,280 --> 03:36:57,820
And I kidnapped two people.

4576
03:36:58,300 --> 03:36:59,620
I kidnapped two people.

4577
03:37:00,220 --> 03:37:00,540
Okay.

4578
03:37:01,100 --> 03:37:03,780
If I do one more game, we're down a game.

4579
03:37:04,480 --> 03:37:06,120
I'd rather we start...

4580
03:37:06,120 --> 03:37:07,420
We go positive here.

4581
03:37:09,920 --> 03:37:11,040
I'd rather...

4582
03:37:11,040 --> 03:37:12,840
Alright, you see...

4583
03:37:12,840 --> 03:37:13,920
I'm on an alt account.

4584
03:37:14,400 --> 03:37:15,740
So I'm having fun.

4585
03:37:16,360 --> 03:37:16,920
Wait, how...

4586
03:37:16,920 --> 03:37:17,660
What's this E though?

4587
03:37:19,980 --> 03:37:21,580
Let's check it live on stream.

4588
03:37:24,830 --> 03:37:25,950
Little does he know.

4589
03:37:26,110 --> 03:37:26,810
I know the trick.

4590
03:37:27,350 --> 03:37:29,170
I'm not just a regular player.

4591
03:37:29,470 --> 03:37:29,930
I play.

4592
03:37:33,490 --> 03:37:34,050
Oh.

4593
03:37:35,110 --> 03:37:35,670
Ouch.

4594
03:37:36,970 --> 03:37:37,910
Alright, but like...

4595
03:37:37,910 --> 03:37:39,150
You can tell when I started stacking.

4596
03:37:40,090 --> 03:37:40,830
So like...

4597
03:37:40,830 --> 03:37:41,570
Right here.

4598
03:37:42,750 --> 03:37:46,390
Solo, solo, solo, solo, solo, solo, solo.

4599
03:37:46,750 --> 03:37:48,370
And then I joined the stack.

4600
03:37:48,370 --> 03:37:49,910
I joined.

4601
03:37:54,370 --> 03:37:55,510
Right here.

4602
03:37:56,890 --> 03:37:58,230
But...

4603
03:37:58,230 --> 03:37:59,790
It was like...

4604
03:38:00,330 --> 03:38:03,310
We don't talk about what happened here.

4605
03:38:10,490 --> 03:38:13,210
I lost.

4606
03:38:13,330 --> 03:38:16,470
I think I was like 1-4 or something.

4607
03:38:16,470 --> 03:38:18,130
Or like 4-1.

4608
03:38:20,510 --> 03:38:21,290
But yes.

4609
03:38:21,490 --> 03:38:23,250
We're gonna end on a high note everybody.

4610
03:38:23,770 --> 03:38:24,210
I had fun.

4611
03:38:24,370 --> 03:38:25,330
I made new friends.

4612
03:38:25,870 --> 03:38:26,790
I made new friends.

4613
03:38:28,010 --> 03:38:29,250
I made new friends.

4614
03:38:29,630 --> 03:38:30,170
Guys, see?

4615
03:38:30,550 --> 03:38:32,490
I'm still making new friends and my rivals.

4616
03:38:33,210 --> 03:38:34,330
I'm having fun.

4617
03:38:34,450 --> 03:38:35,270
That's all that matters.

4618
03:38:35,410 --> 03:38:35,530
Yay.

4619
03:38:35,990 --> 03:38:38,450
Sky, thank you for the tier 1 sub.

4620
03:38:38,570 --> 03:38:38,910
Thank you.

4621
03:38:39,710 --> 03:38:40,430
Thank you.

4622
03:38:40,450 --> 03:38:41,750
I really appreciate it.

4623
03:38:42,110 --> 03:38:43,630
But thank you everybody for watching.

4624
03:38:44,750 --> 03:38:46,030
I really appreciate it guys.

4625
03:38:47,230 --> 03:38:48,310
For those who are new here.

4626
03:38:48,450 --> 03:38:50,150
My name is Doki Bird.

4627
03:38:50,950 --> 03:38:52,030
I almost forgot my name.

4628
03:38:52,150 --> 03:38:53,170
Because I was like, no I'm Doki.

4629
03:38:53,390 --> 03:38:54,790
No I'm Doki Bird.

4630
03:38:55,090 --> 03:38:55,410
Anyway.

4631
03:38:56,550 --> 03:38:57,350
This is a short stream.

4632
03:38:57,430 --> 03:38:59,070
Because I have a stream at 12.30 on YouTube.

4633
03:38:59,370 --> 03:39:00,090
For those who don't know me.

4634
03:39:00,150 --> 03:39:00,890
I usually stream on YouTube.

4635
03:39:00,990 --> 03:39:01,870
So please check me out there.

4636
03:39:02,730 --> 03:39:05,130
I usually tweet out whenever I stream on Twitch on Twitter.

4637
03:39:05,370 --> 03:39:07,730
So follow me on there if you want to know when I stream on Twitch.

4638
03:39:09,130 --> 03:39:09,630
What else?

4639
03:39:10,150 --> 03:39:11,430
If you want to support me via other means.

4640
03:39:11,550 --> 03:39:13,850
I do have merch being sold at the moment.

4641
03:39:14,150 --> 03:39:15,850
I think I have two more days left.

4642
03:39:16,030 --> 03:39:17,510
On my official plushies.

4643
03:39:17,710 --> 03:39:18,830
So please.

4644
03:39:19,190 --> 03:39:19,630
Wait.

4645
03:39:19,850 --> 03:39:20,990
Do I have pictures of it?

4646
03:39:21,350 --> 03:39:22,050
Oh my god.

4647
03:39:22,170 --> 03:39:23,490
Where's the pictures for it?

4648
03:39:23,730 --> 03:39:24,530
Give me a sec guys.

4649
03:39:24,650 --> 03:39:27,070
Please stay so I can show one last time.

4650
03:39:29,370 --> 03:39:31,270
But the exclamation point merch.

4651
03:39:31,430 --> 03:39:31,810
Or plush.

4652
03:39:32,150 --> 03:39:34,830
I do have some of my official plushies being sold right now.

4653
03:39:35,110 --> 03:39:36,530
There is two days left.

4654
03:39:36,610 --> 03:39:37,670
So please check it out.

4655
03:39:38,190 --> 03:39:39,030
Make sure to buy it.

4656
03:39:39,030 --> 03:39:40,150
Because it will be gone forever.

4657
03:39:40,650 --> 03:39:41,550
It will be gone forever.

4658
03:39:43,370 --> 03:39:45,150
If you don't get them in the last two days.

4659
03:39:46,050 --> 03:39:47,170
I guess that's everything.

4660
03:39:47,370 --> 03:39:47,830
As always.

4661
03:39:48,190 --> 03:39:50,970
Thank you so much for all the Twitch subs.

4662
03:39:51,170 --> 03:39:52,030

4663
03:39:52,210 --> 03:39:52,850
For all the bitties.

4664
03:39:53,050 --> 03:39:54,290
I really appreciate it.

4665
03:39:55,250 --> 03:39:56,350
As always everybody.

4666
03:39:56,550 --> 03:39:57,350
Stay hydrated.

4667
03:39:57,510 --> 03:39:58,050
Posture check.

4668
03:39:58,170 --> 03:39:58,810
Get up and move around.

4669
03:39:58,850 --> 03:39:59,670
To get that blood flowing.

4670
03:39:59,770 --> 03:40:00,750
And if you stay up for me.

4671
03:40:00,950 --> 03:40:01,590
Head to bed.

4672
03:40:01,670 --> 03:40:02,950
Cause you deserve it.

4673
03:40:03,190 --> 03:40:04,410
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

4674
03:40:04,910 --> 03:40:05,530
