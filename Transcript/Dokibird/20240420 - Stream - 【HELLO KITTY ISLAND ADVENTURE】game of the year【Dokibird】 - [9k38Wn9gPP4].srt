1
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,020
Oh my god.

2
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:59,650
Bro, oh my fucking god.

3
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,430
I did not realize!

4
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:17,330
Just how- oh my- This game, I'll just say like this fucking game.

5
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,710
Holy shit, this fucking game.

6
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:32,090
Oh my god, the amount of hoops I have to jump to get this- guys, I'm so sorry that we're an hour late.

7
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:34,110
I'm so sorry.

8
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,910
It was- it was hell.

9
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:44,190
It truly was hell trying to get this game to work.

10
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,250
Oh, that's all I'll say.

11
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,810
Was it worth it?

12
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:48,430
I don't know!

13
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,670
I mean, it's so cute though.

14
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,110
Okay, I need to tell you guys the story.

15
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:53,730
I'm so sorry.

16
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:54,590
We're an hour late.

17
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:55,950
I'm so sorry.

18
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:02,290
I went through a whole fucking adventure trying to get this to work, but I hope the volume's okay right now.

19
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,190
I hope the volume's okay.

20
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:05,950
Thank you for the super chat.

21
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:06,290
Thank you.

22
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:06,770
Thank you.

23
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,090
A certified Apple moment.

24
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:08,910
Thank you for the super chat.

25
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:09,510
Thank you.

26
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:09,910
Thank you.

27
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:10,970
Normal size phantom.

28
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:11,810
Thank you for the super chat.

29
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:12,070
Thank you.

30
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:12,790
Thank you.

31
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,050
Well, dokey, was it worth it?

32
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:18,330
All right, so god, this song is so fucking like...

33
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,270
All right, let me tell you guys like the...

34
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,650
How this whole shit went through.

35
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,210
So, um...

36
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,590
Oh, you can bring down the music a little.

37
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,750
Okay, I'm gonna like... I'm like really worried.

38
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:34,330
Because I didn't manage to create a new account.

39
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:38,390
So I'm gonna be very careful right now.

40
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:43,050
I'm gonna... Let me... Let me turn this off real quick.

41
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:51,170
So... Okay, so I'm gonna turn down the music, right?

42
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:53,230
Okay, bring down the music a little bit.

43
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:53,630
Okay.

44
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:56,050
I'm gonna bring down the music a little bit.

45
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,510
I'm... I'm like paranoid as hell right now.

46
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,290
So, anyway...

47
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:08,170
Let me tell you the adventure I had to have... My own little adventure that I had to have.

48
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:12,990
Um, before... Before we had... We were able to get all of this to work.

49
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:20,770
So, my little adventure is that basically what happened was that, um, I woke up and I was like...

50
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:21,750
Uh...

51
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:29,170
What happened was that, um, I realized... I was like, wait a minute.

52
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:29,850
Because I don't know.

53
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,890
This must be an old iPad.

54
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:34,190
Because I was like... I was like, I don't need to.

55
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:39,010
I was like, oh man, I don't... I don't need to have a...

56
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:42,430
Um, I don't need to have a new iPad.

57
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:45,070
You know, I have so much streaming experience.

58
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,950
I can just use... Because I don't have an iPad.

59
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,770
I use my dad's iPad.

60
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:50,710
I was like...

61
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,470
I don't need a new iPad.

62
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,510
I'll just borrow my parents iPad.

63
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:57,090
Because iPads are so fucking expensive.

64
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:01,810
What I didn't realize is that, um, this is...

65
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,410
Is this like a particularly old iPad?

66
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:08,830
You know it's a particularly old iPad because the adapter...

67
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,130
The iPad adapter is still like...

68
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,810
The adapter is still USB-C.

69
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,570
It's not a lightning adapter.

70
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,910
You know, it was before when Apple...

71
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:20,630
You know, it was before when Apple decided to...

72
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:22,950
You know, make everything using the lightning adapter.

73
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:23,650
Like...

74
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,730
Like made everything...

75
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:31,730
So, you know it's old when the iPad is still using USB-C before the Apple was like...

76
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:32,090
Nuh-uh.

77
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:35,310
We're gonna make everything lightning.

78
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:37,610
So...

79
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:42,390
So, I didn't realize I didn't have the adapter for the...

80
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,330
For to use for the game capture.

81
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:49,150
Because I was like, oh yeah, I can just...

82
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:51,470
I...

83
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:54,850
I can just, you know, I'll just use this...

84
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:57,850
This game capture adapter that I have for my iPhone.

85
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,490
That I use to stream with my iPhone.

86
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,870
And then I was like, wait a minute.

87
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:03,670
Why doesn't it fit?

88
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,510
Oh, I meant the 30 pin.

89
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:07,910
Sorry.

90
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:08,990
The 30 pin.

91
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:09,670
I don't remember.

92
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:10,770
It's one of them.

93
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:15,270
Okay.

94
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:16,690
It's one of them.

95
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,470
I don't remember.

96
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:18,770
Okay, so...

97
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:19,590
Um...

98
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:20,430
Anyway.

99
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,510
Uh...

100
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:24,510
I just know that like the one I have is not...

101
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,150
Does not work.

102
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:28,070
Because like it doesn't fit into the one.

103
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:28,750
Because it...

104
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,230
I was like, okay, so I need to...

105
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,870
I need to buy...

106
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,010
I need to go to...

107
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:36,550
I need to go to an electronic store and buy an adapter.

108
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,170
Because I was like, oh, I'll just use my Android adapter.

109
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,670
You know?

110
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,230
Yeah.

111
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:45,350
The one when I had the Android pad.

112
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:46,290
I don't know.

113
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:47,890
What do they call the Android iPad?

114
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,570
Do they just call it the Android tablet?

115
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:49,890
Sorry.

116
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:50,410
Anyway.

117
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,950
I just need the Android tablet to...

118
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:53,250
Um...

119
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:56,570
Because I have the adapter to stream my Android tablet.

120
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,170
Because this game is an Apple exclusive.

121
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,550
By the way, I hope the sound's okay.

122
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:01,810
I turned down the sound on my end.

123
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,250
Oh, there was no sound.

124
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,250
There's no music at all.

125
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,650
You just hear the fucking ambience.

126
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:06,450
Never mind.

127
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:07,050
Uh...

128
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:09,130
Never mind.

129
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:10,250
Anyway.

130
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:12,310
So...

131
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,070
Um...

132
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,070
I was like, all right.

133
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,990
I have an adapter for Android tablets.

134
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:20,210
And like my cable for the iPad fits an Android tablet.

135
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:25,170
So I'll use the Android tablet adapter to plug into my game capture.

136
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:26,910
That would work, right?

137
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:27,830
So...

138
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,830
It didn't.

139
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:29,310
Um...

140
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,290
It would kept crashing.

141
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,430
The game capture kept crashing.

142
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,510
Because who would have thought?

143
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:37,570
Uh...

144
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:38,690
It didn't work.

145
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:39,630
So...

146
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,470
So I was like, okay.

147
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:44,530
We gotta go to the electronic store.

148
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:45,850
And like...

149
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:49,230
We gotta go to the electronic store and buy the adapter.

150
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:50,170
The app.

151
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:50,530
Apple.

152
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:51,390
You know, like...

153
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:51,870
Cause you know.

154
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:56,870
The Apple approved adapter that can connect to the game capture.

155
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:58,090
So I bought that.

156
00:07:58,370 --> 00:07:59,990
And then I came back.

157
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,170
And I was like, all right.

158
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:01,550
Good.

159
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,790
We should be able to stream now.

160
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:06,170
And then I was like, wait a minute.

161
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:13,170
I can't buy any games because this account is, you know, my dad's account.

162
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:14,610
And I need a password.

163
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:15,950
So I was like, okay.

164
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:19,070
I'm gonna log out and create a new account.

165
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:21,250
And then it wouldn't let me.

166
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:23,830
It wouldn't let me put in a phone number.

167
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:26,690
It wouldn't let me put in a phone number to create a new account.

168
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:28,450
It wouldn't let me do like two factors.

169
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,710
It wouldn't let me like sync a payment to it.

170
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:31,630
So I was like, okay.

171
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:34,110
I'm just gonna log into my dad's account.

172
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,770
I was like, dad, what's the password?

173
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,110
And he was like, I don't know.

174
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,330
It's like, I don't know.

175
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:47,950
I don't know what the fucking password is.

176
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:49,050
I don't know.

177
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,830
I was like, okay.

178
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,610
It's a Yahoo account, dad.

179
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:53,490
Do you remember?

180
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:56,190
He's like, I don't fucking know who uses Yahoo anymore.

181
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:59,510
And I was like, oh no, my iPad went to sleep.

182
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:00,310
Oh no.

183
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,110
Okay.

184
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,850
It's gonna be a black screen until my iPad's not sleeping.

185
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:04,610
Anyway.

186
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:06,350
Anyway.

187
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,710
I was like, okay.

188
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:14,170
Then why don't you like, can you like log in?

189
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,290
He's like, no.

190
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,610
And I can't log out.

191
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:21,030
Cause I need the password to log out.

192
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:29,730
So, so, so, and then I was like, okay, what if I log out on the iTunes store on the iTunes app store?

193
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:36,970
And, and then, and then, um, I'll log into my accounts or like to like your other account.

194
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:39,090
He's like, oh yeah, I have another account you can log into.

195
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:44,970
And then, so I logged into the other dad account that he has, that's a Gmail account and not a Yahoo account.

196
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,390
Cause he actually has access to it.

197
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,410
And then, and then we realized.

198
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:55,050
That his Gmail account is, um, his, his Gmail account is not registered in NA.

199
00:09:55,270 --> 00:10:01,510
So the store for those who don't know Hello Kitty Island Adventure is a, is an Apple exclusive.

200
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:07,190
And it's also only in NA or like, I don't definitely not in Asia.

201
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:14,330
It's, it's definitely not in Asia.

202
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,250
So I was like, oh fuck.

203
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:16,750
Okay.

204
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:17,890
Now I need to figure out.

205
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:18,390
Now I need to figure out.

206
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:22,590
Can I change the store country, the country of the store.

207
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:27,730
So I changed the country of the store and then I changed it.

208
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:30,970
But then they're like, well, we need a payment card for Canada.

209
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,750
So I was like, all right, I'll just put my cards on.

210
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,810
And they're like, we can't verify this payment.

211
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,270
I was like, okay, I'll just use PayPal.

212
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:38,350
And they're like, we can't verify this either.

213
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:39,270
And I was like, okay.

214
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:40,210
I'm fucking.

215
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:48,270
So, so yeah, we, it was region locked to a specific.

216
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:50,290
So I was like, okay.

217
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:55,610
And then my dad, they was like, oh my God, we have your, we have access to the Yahoo account.

218
00:10:56,050 --> 00:11:00,470
Cause like they were like, look, my dad and mom was looking through like various cause like, okay.

219
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:10,270
Um, um, they've been, they've been using Apple phones for a long time since Apple iPhones were since iPhones were like first introduced when the iPhone was made of metal.

220
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:11,810
Was it metal?

221
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:16,370
It was like, I remember like the very first iPhone was like metal and it was like super heavy and all of that.

222
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,250
So like they were just looking through like metal.

223
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,590
And then they were like, oh, I'm going to go through the collections of iPhones.

224
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:25,350
And one of them still had the Yahoo account registered to the iPhone.

225
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,470
To the iPhone.

226
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,310
They're like, we got it.

227
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:36,070
We got access to the iPhone.

228
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,250
We got access to the Yahoo mail.

229
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:47,450
Cause they were looking through like the collection of phones and like one of the phones, one of the phones slash iPads had access.

230
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,250
Like had access.

231
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:52,470
Like had literal access to the, to the Yahoo account.

232
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:57,610
So we were able to change the password and they're like, you change it since you're going to use it.

233
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:58,970
You use the password for it.

234
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:06,510
And then, so then I had to change the password and then now, and then I finally, I bought Hello Kitty Island Adventure.

235
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:10,510
Oh my God.

236
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:18,030
It was truly a fucking adventure to actually get started playing Hello Kitty Island Adventure.

237
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,990
And oh my God.

238
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:23,850
It was so painful.

239
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:31,250
I was like, I couldn't believe we had to go through so much just to play this fucking game.

240
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:31,750
Did you write?

241
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:32,750
I wrote the password.

242
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,110
The struggles we go through for Hello Kitty.

243
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,050
Thank you for the super chat.

244
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:37,470
Thank you.

245
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:37,890
Thank you.

246
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:44,850
It really was a fucking journey to get here just to play this fucking game.

247
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:47,910
Anyway, for those who are like, what is Hello Kitty Island Adventure?

248
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:48,250
I'm like, I don't know.

249
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:58,250
It's essentially like, it's essentially like a Animal Crossing, but instead of like Animal Crossing characters, it's just all Samuel characters.

250
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:01,170
And it's, but it's only on the apples.

251
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:06,610
Like Apple devices apparently can play on the mac and everything, but like...

252
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:08,590
Yeah.

253
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:15,350
I think the only people who use Mac, I'm so sorry to all the Mac users.

254
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:18,030
But I feel like the only people who use like

255
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:21,750
I'm not sure if you're seeing this on the video.

256
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,810
So, like, I'm not sure if you're seeing this on the video.

257
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:26,830
So, like, I'm not sure if you're seeing this on the video.

258
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:31,610
I guess, like, normies, I guess.

259
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,410
But I don't know.

260
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:34,430
Same here.

261
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,990
I don't know who buys a Mac anymore.

262
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:41,850
But I know a lot of, like, video audio editors still use the Mac for, like, stuff there, I guess.

263
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:42,610
Yes, like...

264
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:53,970
But yes, it's sadly only an Apple exclusive and it really was...

265
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:57,370
so painful to get here.

266
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:58,490
Alright, here we go.

267
00:13:58,650 --> 00:13:59,230
I'm like... alright.

268
00:13:59,450 --> 00:13:59,950
Yay!

269
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,110
Wanna go fishing?

270
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:05,330
Batsumaru can teach you to make a fishing rod!

271
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:06,390
Yay!

272
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,730
We're loading!

273
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:11,230
Okay, I'm gonna get rid of this like thumb thing over here.

274
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,410
Alright, it's gonna bother you.

275
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:15,920
It might bother you guys a little bit, but I'm just gonna...

276
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:18,770
Oh, you're awake!

277
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:19,370

00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:20,130
I'm Hello Kitty!

279
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:24,050
Please don't dox my family.

280
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:33,630
Hello Kitty, please let me fill in my own name.

281
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:43,570
That's all I ask, Ms. Kitty.

282
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:45,650
That's all I ask of you.

283
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,010
Okay, alright, alright.

284
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:55,970
Are you ready for a vacation at Big Adventures Park?

285
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,230
Yes.

286
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:58,250
Uh, yes.

287
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:02,810
We should be arriving soon, so you wanna freshen up, but now is the time!

288
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:06,070
Oh my god, Hello Kitty, big fan!

289
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:10,970
You know, guys, I'm gonna say, I think... I think she's overrated.

290
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:14,310
I think it was super chat.

Your life is in her hands now.

295
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:25,490
Oh my god, your entire life is in Hello Kitty's hands.

296
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:29,010
Alright, I'm gonna... I don't know.

00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,790

00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:45,990
I don't...

303
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,750
Oh my god!

304
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,570

305
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,010
Okay, wait, let's see.

00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:06,910
And then...

Wait, they're all so good!

321
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:24,710
Instead of doxing me, I dox you guys.

Okay, wait, they're all so fucking good!

323
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,290
Okay, I don't know.

Oh my gosh, I can't... they're all so cute.

325

Which one's the stupid eyes?

327
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,150
They're all pretty dumb.

328
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:38,970
They're all pretty dumb.

329
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:41,190
They're all pretty dumb.

330
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:41,570
They're all pretty dumb though.

331
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:42,890
Which one's the stupid ones?

332
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:43,870
Alright.

333
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:45,530
Maybe...

334
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,930
Either this or... this.

335
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,310
I don't know.

336
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:50,970

00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,330
Okay, I see more twos.

353
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:13,650
Alright.

354
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:15,010
Beaks.

355
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:16,270
Oh, that's like a duck beak.

356
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:19,310
Okay, this one is... that's an eagle.

357
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:22,090
I feel like this or this.

358
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,730
Did I break it?

359
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:25,890
Oh, I was gonna say.

360
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:30,490
I think maybe... this one looks more like a dragoon.

361
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,870
This one and then... what is this?

362
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,530
Oh, it's like the face markings.

363
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,990
Okay, I think this one definitely.

364
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:39,430
Okay, I think this one definitely.

365
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:39,970
I think we got it.

366
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:40,970
Can we change clothes?

367
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:42,690
Oh, we can.

368
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:45,850
Okay.

369
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,250
Sorry, I just thought...

370
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,050
Okay, let's see.

371
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,110
No hats because we can't afford hats right now.

372
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:52,750
Alright.

373
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,630
I think... I think...

374
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:58,210
Wait, should we give you a... this shirt or a green shirt?

375
00:17:58,610 --> 00:17:59,050
Guys.

376
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:00,070
Damn.

377
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:03,490
Rob.

378
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:05,530
Black shirt?

379
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,770
You guys want a black shirt?

380
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:08,930
We meant three?

381
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:10,290
Okay, five.

382
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:11,530
Oh, wait.

383
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:12,010
No shirt.

384
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:12,570
No shirt.

385
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:14,430
This one?

386
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:15,630
You want this?

387
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:18,630
No, three.

388
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,830
Wait, I don't want you guys to wear a shirt.

389
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:22,990
Wait, can I not get...

390
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:27,530
Nice.

391
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:29,090
Okay, this is good.

392
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:34,890
Alright.

393
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:35,890
Okay, we're good.

394
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:36,990
I think this is perfect.

395
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:37,710
I think...

396
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:39,330
Honestly, I think this is perfect.

397
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:39,790
Yes.

398
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:40,530
Yes.

399
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:40,990
The...

400
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,910
The pure dragoon.

401
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,310
Dragoon uncut right there.

402
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:47,990
The no filter dragoon right here.

403
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,730
Doki, this is... This is...

404
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:50,770
What is there?

405
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:51,670
What am I exposing?

406
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:52,790
You have nothing.

407
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:54,910
What am I exposing?

408
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:56,690
There's literally nothing.

409
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:57,870
Dragoons.

410
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:58,770
There's nothing.

411
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,630
Finally, dragoon cheek talk.

412
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:02,310
Surreal.

413
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:04,090
Guys, thank you for the super chat.

414
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:04,570
Thank you.

415
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:05,070
Thank you.

416
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:07,350
My eyes are up there, ladies.

417
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,670
Alright, accept.

418
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:09,710
Yay!

419
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:13,910
You look great!

420
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,750
Oh my gosh, thank you, Miss Kitty.

421
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:20,890
If you want to change your appearance later, you can do so at any time at a mirror.

422
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:21,890
Okay, nice.

423
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:22,410
We don't...

424
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,370
No, you guys are perfect right there.

425
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:25,210
I think you're perfect.

426
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:26,910
Just as the way you look like.

427
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:27,610
What?

428
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,890
You guys never wore any pants?

429
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:30,270
Even before.

430
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:35,450
You might have worn a shirt, but never any pants.

431
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,990
What are you exposing right now?

432
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:38,370
Nothing.

433
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:40,110
We still have some time.

434
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:42,010
You can meet others on our flight if you like to.

435
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:43,590
Come talk to me.

436
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:45,210
I feel like you're done chatting.

437
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:45,690
Okay.

438
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:47,830
Oh my God, look!

439
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,450
Press to move.

440
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:51,930
Okay.

441
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:53,590
Move.

442
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:55,290
Talk to some of the passengers.

443
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:56,030
Okay.

444
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:58,590
What?

445
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,450
Oh, I'm right here.

446
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:00,530
But like...

447
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:02,270
Okay, here.

448
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:03,710
Oh my God!

449
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:04,770
Look, I'm moving!

450
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:05,330
I'm naked!

451
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:06,730
You're naked!

452
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,370
Talk to me.

453
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,350
Tuxedo Sam.

454
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,590
Greetings and salutations.

455
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:18,110
Tuxedo Sam, at your service.

456
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:19,630
An honor.

457
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:20,650
Nice to meet you.

458
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:24,550
Making new friends is always delightful and quite inspiring.

459
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:27,090
You see, I'm both a designer and collector...

460
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:29,190
Oh, they're gonna let me... give me clothes later.

461
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:31,190
We don't need clothes though.

462
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:33,910
CJ, thank you for the super chat.

463
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:34,650
Thank you, thank you.

464
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:35,210
We love you.

465
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:35,430
Don't...

466
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:36,490
Okay, cool and cute.

467
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:37,310
Thank you for the super chat.

468
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,050
Thank you, thank you.

469
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,610
Please don't hesitate to ask.

470
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,670
Okay, this is the guy we're never gonna talk to.

471
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:43,970
Cause like, we're never gonna need clothes.

472
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:48,050
Nothing makes me happier than helping my friends look their best.

473
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:51,470
If you'll excuse me, I feel inspiration about to strike.

474
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:52,470
Alright.

475
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:54,190
I wanna talk to Kuromi.

476
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:57,970
Are you still talking to new friends or do you wanna meet them?

477
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:58,950
No, I'm still chatting.

478
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:01,150
Wait, I wanna talk to Kuromi!

479
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,850
But I can jump too?

480
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:04,970
Oh my god.

481
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:05,710
Kuromi!

482
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:06,810
Let me bother you!

483
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,090
Hey, how are you?

484
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:10,950
I can't wait to see the island.

485
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:15,610
Oh, this is like the Animal Crossing in the beginning where you're talking to people before you arrive in the town.

486
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:17,110
The name's Kuromi.

487
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:23,310
Don't believe anything those two jokers, Batsmata and Kuromi say about me.

488
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,470
Yeah, they're all wrong.

489
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:26,510
You're always right, miss.

490
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:27,550
My queen.

491
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:28,970
I see you noticed my book.

492
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:33,750
I've been collecting vintage tickets, posters, and pretty much anything I could find.

493
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,990
Sometimes I didn't even think it was real.

494
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,070
Like maybe it was an elaborate hoax.

495
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:41,670
So I decided to film an episode of my show.

496
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:43,210
Kuromi explains it all.

497
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:44,290
Oh my god, she's famous.

498
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:45,070
Of course she is.

499
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:45,850
She's a queen.

500
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,770
But my Melisandre could just enjoy myself.

501
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:49,930
Don't listen to that bitch.

502
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:54,970
I'm just hoping Wookiee Swamps lives up to his reputation.

503
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:58,070
Do what you wanna do, my queen.

504
00:21:59,190 --> 00:21:59,630
Alright.

505
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:02,210
CJ, thank you for the super chat.

506
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:02,550
Thank you.

507
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:03,150
Thank you.

508
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,130
What will hella kid you think?

509
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:05,790
She loves it.

510
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:06,270
What do you mean?

511
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:08,190
Oh my god.

512
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:09,250
Get out of the way.

513
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:09,970
I'm talking.

514
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,030
No, get out of the way.

515
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,370
I only wanna talk to one person.

516
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:13,670
Get out of the way.

517
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:14,950
I wanna talk to Papa Bird.

518
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:16,890
I don't care about you.

519
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,350
I don't care about you poochy whatever.

520
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:20,770
Oh my god.

521
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:21,190
Oh my god.

522
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:21,990
That's...

523
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,270
Oh my gosh.

524
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,290
I can't remember how to say your name.

525
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:27,250
Ritsuko.

526
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:31,870
I was like thinking about the show's name.

527
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:35,410
I haven't watched the last two seasons of Ritsuko yet.

528
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:36,370
Agatsuko.

529
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,270
Miss Flight Se...

530
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:39,130
Like you...

531
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,470
Okay, so spoiler alert.

532
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:44,810
There was a scene where like she gets dumped and then she settles for this other guy.

533
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,350
And then I was so mad that I never watched...

534
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:48,810
I never...

535
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:50,450
I didn't watch the season after.

536
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,690
I was so...

537
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:53,950
I was so mad.

538
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:57,050
I was like why did you settle for him?

539
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:59,270
He's a fucking loser.

540
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:05,090
I'm sorry for all those...

541
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:08,750
All those people that actually like this particular character.

542
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:09,770
I...

543
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:10,750
I was...

544
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,050
I wish he...

545
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:16,450
That guy went with this other girl and not her because she...

546
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:17,950
Ritsuko deserves so much more.

547
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:18,870
I'm just gonna say.

548
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:22,050
She...

549
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:24,710
She deserves so much more.

550
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:27,070
She does not deserve...

551
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,310
He does not deserve her.

552
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:29,250
And then I never watched the last two seasons.

553
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:33,630
I watched the season after that because I was so sad that like she dumped that other guy.

554
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:36,310
This flight search seems like it's taking forever.

555
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,230
I grabbed it because my original flight got cancelled.

556
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:41,290
I think we're almost there.

557
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:43,770
Please my eyes are up here, Ms. Ritsuko.

558
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:46,770
It's nice to meet you.

559
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:47,270
I'm Ritsuko.

560
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:51,030
I took some time off from work because I have a really stressful job.

561
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:51,430
Oh yeah.

562
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:53,070
She said OL by the way.

563
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:56,590
I was hoping a break from the office would be good for me.

564
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,110
I think...

565
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:01,750
I'm thinking about my boss and the work that's probably piling up.

566
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:03,750
I'm getting even more freaked out.

567
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:04,070
No!

568
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:07,910
I don't know anyone in the plane but they seem to all know each other.

569
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:09,110
Don't worry Ritsuko.

570
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,070
You can know me.

571
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,150
But my eyes are up here by the way.

572
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:15,350
They do seem unusually friendly though.

573
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:17,690
You already gave me gifts.

574
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:18,310
Oh my god.

575
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,170
Where's my gifts?

576
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:21,030
It was nice meeting you.

577
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:22,330
It was nice meeting you too Ritsuko.

578
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:23,890
Okay.

579
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:24,210
I'm done.

580
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:28,250
If I can't talk to Pom Pom Purin then I don't care anymore.

581
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:29,090
I'm done.

582
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:30,250
I'm done.

583
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:30,370
All right.

584
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:31,070
I'm ready.

585
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:32,230
Where's Tsunomaru?

586
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:37,850
This is such an exciting opportunity for my...

587
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:37,990
Okay.

588
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:38,950
I don't care about her either.

589
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:44,870
It's not everyday you get invited to open this door on the tropical island resort.

590
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:50,010
And who talked to you my Melody?

591
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,950
No one asked for you Melody?

592
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,450
And theme park.

593
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,790
We're here to support you my Melanie.

594
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:00,330
Oh, I can't say no.

595
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:04,070
Oh, thank you!

596
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:05,270
You're both so kind!

597
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:21,270
I'm ready to land.

598
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:22,450
Take me down.

599
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:24,770
I want my new village.

600
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:25,810
Do I keep being rude?

601
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:28,050
I didn't ask her to talk to me!

602
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:30,310
She butted into the conversation!

603
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:36,090
Mv, thank you for the super chat.

604
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:36,430
Thank you!

605
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:41,450
I think Kuromi actually has episodes of her show on the Hylokitty and Friends YouTube.

606
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:42,310
Oh my god.

607
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:47,390
I love how each Sanrio character actually has their own YouTube channel.

608
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:48,790
In Japanese.

609
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:52,190
And they actually upload cover music videos too, which is funny.

610
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:53,710
I'll go get you a slice.

611
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:55,170
Just wait for me at your seat, okay?

612
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:58,190
Look, I want to make new friends.

613
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:59,330
But not Melody.

614
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:00,310
Not Melody.

615
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:01,330
Not some of the people here.

616
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:02,150
Okay.

617
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:06,250
I get to pick and choose which...

618
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:08,470
...Sanrio character I want to be friends with.

619
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:13,710
Is there a fucking oven in the plane?

620
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:16,490
That should not do well with the air pressure.

621
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:18,110
So delicious.

622
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:20,530
As long as I input the settings right, of course.

623
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:21,710
Okay, let's see.

624
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:23,490
Why is there an oven on the plane?

625
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,010
Is that safe?

626
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:27,550
Beep.

627
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:30,790
Beep.

628
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:31,430
Boop.

629
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:32,410
Beep.

630
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:32,970
Error.

631
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:37,210
Please press bake to send an error report.

632
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:38,150
Error.

633
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:40,790
Oh no!

634
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:41,930
What did Kitty do?

635
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,530
What did you do, Kitty?

636
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:47,150
Who put an oven on the plane?

637
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,150
Oh no.

638
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:53,010
Free food.

639
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:54,150
My second rule.

640
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:55,670
I can't turn it off.

641
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:57,770
More geeks keep flying out.

642
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:01,750
Everybody hold on your lunches.

643
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,530
It's about to...

644
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:03,050
Oh my god.

645
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,370
The cake caused turbulence.

646
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:05,670
How?

647
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:09,410
It's too much cake.

648
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,270
There's the island.

649
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:13,170
We're so close.

650
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:15,630
Oh no.

651
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:17,170
There's smoke coming out of the plane.

652
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:18,430
Are we just gonna fucking...

653
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:18,870
Oh no.

654
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:19,890
That's Mario.

655
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:20,910
Enough is enough.

656
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,890
I've had it with these cake...

657
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:22,910
Oh.

658
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:26,090
Oh my god.

659
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:27,630
I'm so sorry.

660
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:28,430
Oh my god.

661
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:30,750
It's the cakes on the plane.

662
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:34,410
Wait.

663
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,390
It's cakes on the plane.

664
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:39,810
What?

665
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:43,310
Everyone take some balloons.

666
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:46,130
We're gonna have to jump.

667
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:50,980
Okay.

668
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:51,400
Don't worry.

669
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,780
Single file, everybody.

670
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:57,220
Single file as we jump off the plane.

671
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:57,980
Wait.

672
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,060
But is the plane gonna...

673
00:27:59,060 --> 00:27:59,300
Is it gonna crash?

674
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,480
What year is it?

675
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:09,140
These motherfucking cakes on this motherfucking plane.

676
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,740
Don't worry.

677
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,340
These balloons will keep you safe.

678
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:13,940
I promise.

679
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:14,960
Hang on tight.

680
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,360
Okay.

681
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:16,920
I hope so.

682
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:17,340
Wow.

683
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,780
I see balloons.

684
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,200
Jump.

685
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:21,800
Jump.

686
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,520
Jump.

687
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,020
Okay.

688
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:25,580
Yay.

689
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,220
Oh shit.

690
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,220
Oh shit.

691
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,080
I didn't know about this.

692
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:30,900
I can move.

693
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:31,840
The fuck?

694
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:32,980
How do I...

695
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,100
Jump and float to the...

696
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:35,440
Oh.

697
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:36,880
Guys.

698
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,420
Guys.

699
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:38,940
Guys.

700
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:39,300
Whoa.

701
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,780
Maybe I'll hit one ring.

702
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:41,740
I did it.

703
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:45,800
Guys.

704
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,920
I did it.

705
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,140
I got a ring.

706
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,940
I got one.

707
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,360
That's all that matters.

708
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,480
Guys.

709
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,080
I got one.

710
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:53,540
Okay.

711
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,200
Do you happen to know this-this word?

712
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,200
How can we find it?

713
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:00,420
No.

714
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,100
I didn't care.

715
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,820
I didn't care.

716
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:07,260
Chococat found one of the resort's map and scanned it.

717
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,720
Here, I'll send it to you.

718
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:09,420
Okay.

719
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,020
Just open the map on your phone and look for my Melody.

720
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,580
You need help finding.

721
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,860
Do I have to find her?

722
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:21,880
Find three strawberry- The guy in light will show you where to go just follow it.

723
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,160
Oh my god.

724
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,480
Oh my god, I have my own iPhone within my iPad.

725
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,880
When you find her, would you give her the strawberry?

726
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,060
Yay!

727
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:37,080
Gosh, this looks so weird that you're naked.

728
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,980
Thank you for the super chat.

729
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,840
Thank you, thank you, Airpoint.

730
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:50,100
No one should be lost on an island without a healthy snack.

731
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,800
Wait, where's my snack though?

732
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,660
You gotta find my Melody.

733
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,140
Oh wait, there's something over here.

734
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:56,920
What is this?

735
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:58,860
I got a game ticket.

736
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,600
Oh my gosh, there's gonna be video games.

737
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:03,240
I got mystic stone.

738
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,380
There's so much stuff here.

739
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:08,920
Strawberry crate.

740
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,020
I mean, she has to be here.

741
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,360
This is literally her house.

742
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,340
Did she just... no?

743
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,880
Oh my god!

744
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,380
Okay, we're gonna be nice to Melody.

745
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,140
She owns the store.

746
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,380
Guys, we have to be nice to her now.

747
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,080
Because she has a store, guys.

748
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,520
Okay guys, we need to have like...

749
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,520
She's like... oh, she's like the Tom Nooks in Animal Crossing.

750
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,060
What is this?

751
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,000
The strawberry crate.

752
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,280
What is this?

753
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,080
Happy landings?

754
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,640
Oh, they're like active quests.

755
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:42,880
Okay.

756
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,020
Where's the... I need to find...

757
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,000
Track progress.

758
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,100
Show guide, please.

759
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,660
I'm baby.

760
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,800
Tell me where to go.

761
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,360
Okay, it is right... Okay, she's over there.

762
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,520
Okay, we can do that.

763
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:02,240
Oh my god, they have a discord too and everything.

764
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,380
Holy shit.

765
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:06,700
Alright.

766
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:09,080
Oh my god, thank god for the guiding light.

767
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,580
Thank god.

768
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,400
Is that her?

769
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,440
She's over here.

770
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,440
Ma'am, where's the namoro?

771
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,580
Where's the real star?

772
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,140
Would you like a strawberry?

773
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,560
Miss Melody?

774
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:22,680
A gift?

775
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,480
That's so thoughtful.

776
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,340
I know all me.

777
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,080
I found it just for you.

778
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,480
Try gifting a strawberry to me.

779
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,300
You know like...

780
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,000
Oh my god, she's so demanding.

781
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,460
Better than yellow paint.

782
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,180
I know, right?

783
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,500
Oh my god.

784
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,420
I already... You need it to be wrapped.

785
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,140
This is why I don't like Melody.

786
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,020
She's so...

787
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,700
She's so high maintenance.

788
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,020
Kuromi wouldn't care.

789
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,680
She'd just be happy that I fucking got her a strawberry.

790
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,080
I didn't need to wrap it for her.

791
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:51,960
So demanding.

792
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:59,720
I wonder if I like suck up to her and she'll like give me discounts for her store.

793
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,140
Be mean again?

794
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,980
She literally told me to wrap her gift for her.

795
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:06,440
She knew I was gonna give her a strawberry.

796
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,480
Giving gifts is a great way to make friends.

797
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,380
I try to pick gifts that everyone likes.

798
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,260
For example, how a kitty likes fruity things.

799
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,600
Like an apple pie.

800
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,480
That's Mario likes jokes and gags.

801
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,620
So I'll give him a...

802
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:20,080
Okay, this is a good one.

803
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,640
These are another people I wanna get close to.

804
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:26,480
Each time you give someone someone like, your friendship with them will continue to grow.

805
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:29,740
They'll also give you gifts in return which can be very useful.

806
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:33,140
Try learning what everyone likes and becoming good friends.

807
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,200
Oh, and you can only give three gifts a day to each friend.

808
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,660
Does that make sense?

809
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,700
Yeah, I understand now.

810
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,300
By the way, have you seen anyone else since you arrived?

811
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,720
In the plaza.

812
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,160
That's where everybody is.

813
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:47,860
Great!

814
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,580
Lead the way!

815
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,000
Oh my god.

816
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,300
Now this isn't...

817
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:51,980
Oh, I got a flower!

818
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,320
New friend!

819
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:57,920
You're now friends with my Melody.

820
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,700
Okay, follow me miss.

821
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:04,200
Don't worry, I have the guiding light so I won't get lost ever again.

822
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,520
Hello, hello kitty.

823
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,980
I got Melody here.

824
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,520
Wait, I don't see Kuromi.

825
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,380
Where is she?

826
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,340
Where's Kuromi?

827
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,900
By my calculations, she's here.

828
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,700
Half our party seems to be absent.

829
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,440
No!

830
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,640
I just realized all the ones I hate are on this side!

831
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,140
No!

832
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:36,580
No!

833
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:38,800
No!

834
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:44,840
I'm missing...

835
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,100
Yeah, wasn't there Retsuko?

836
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:51,290
Yeah, what about Retsuko?

837
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:53,390
They forgot about Retsuko?

838
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:55,430
They're like...

839
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:57,010
Isn't there one more per...

840
00:33:57,010 --> 00:33:58,050
That is so fucked up.

841
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:00,830
Retsuko is so much more famous than you, pochi.

842
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:02,550
Hello?

843
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:05,130
Can I help?

844
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,630
Oh, oh dear.

845
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,650
She didn't make it.

846
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:15,410
Who is that?

847
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:16,150
A ghost?

848
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:20,230
I believe it was a hologram.

849
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:23,250
Sophisticated technology but deteriorated.

850
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:24,610
She's so smart.

851
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:28,490
The island has only become more mysterious since we arrived.

852
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:30,730
I'm going to set up camp.

853
00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:34,630
We need a base of operation to discover what's afoot and find everyone.

854
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:36,490
Oh my god, he's like Sherlock Holmes.

855
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:39,250
That's a good idea.

856
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:40,630
We should split up, gang.

857
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:42,590
Look for clues.

858
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:44,410
When this becomes Scooby Doo.

859
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:45,710
Split up?

860
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:47,190
You should never split the party.

861
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:52,410
Batsumaru, you watch too many scary movies.

862
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:55,110
I'm serious!

863
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:56,870
There's no one here!

864
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:58,990
There's not even staff!

865
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:03,170
Don't stop slandering my boy, pochi.

866
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:04,590
Bro!

867
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:06,310
He started it!

868
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:09,290
He didn't think Retsuko was important enough.

869
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:14,270
But Retsuko is more famous than him because she has a TV show.

870
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:15,850
Where's his TV show?

871
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:20,690
And don't say he was in the Hello Kitty show because it literally says Hello Kitty.

872
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:23,450
He was a guest star.

873
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:26,850
I don't know.

874
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:27,950
I was supposed to be staffed.

875
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:28,330
And look!

876
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:29,710
There's my new store.

877
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:37,570
They specifically said I needed furniture and decorations in my shop.

878
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:40,970
Maybe we can fix up the cabins for our own visitors.

879
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:47,110
And that looks like a place where I can make food for all of us.

880
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:50,070
All of us?

881
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:50,570
Even me?

882
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:52,910
Fine.

883
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:54,570
I'll go check by the beach.

884
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:56,830
Maybe there will be a snack bar or something.

885
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:58,930
He's part of the friends.

886
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:01,750
Hello Kitty and friends.

887
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:04,350
He's in the friend section, doki.

888
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:08,430
Why don't you see if my Melody needs any help?

889
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:12,950
It must suck to be Melody because like her sister...

890
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:14,990
Is Kuromi...

891
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:16,210
No, Kuromi is not sister.

892
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:17,950
Kuromi is just a really good friend.

893
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:18,450
Right?

894
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:19,750
Or was it cousin?

895
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:20,810
I don't know.

896
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:22,090
The lore keeps changing.

897
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:26,810
I don't remember if Kuromi is supposed to be like cousin, sister or a friend.

898
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:34,670
But like Melody is just jealous because Kuromi ended up being more popular than her.

899
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:38,250
Alright.

900
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:40,590
Help Melody at the gift shop.

901
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:41,630
Where do you want help from?

902
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:48,670
Welcome to the grand opening of Small Gift Bag Smiles.

903
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:52,150
That's a terrible name Melody.

904
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:53,190
I was like what?

905
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:54,590
Did I read this correct?

906
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:55,590
Wait.

907
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:56,790
That's a terrible name Melody.

908
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:59,730
Did I read that story name correct?

909
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:02,770
Small Gift Big Smile Tropical Edition.

910
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:05,630
It was sweet of you to come and find me earlier.

911
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:08,370
I'm sure you'll find the rest of our friends too.

912
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:12,090
And when you do, I just have the thing.

913
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:13,710
I want to see.

914
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:14,750
What do you have Melody?

915
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:20,450
You see, I brought welcome gifts for all our friends.

916
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:25,070
When you find them, you make sure to brighten your day with these gifts.

917
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:26,690
Oh, I'm an excellent gift giver.

918
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:27,590
I am.

919
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:29,130
Thank you so much.

920
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:31,870
This will be a great way for you to make friends with everyone here.

921
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:33,270
Pay to win.

922
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:37,230
Okay, the moment Cinnamoroll gets here, I'm going to fucking spend so much money.

923
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:39,210
So that Cinnamoroll will be my friend.

924
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,150
You know Cinnamoroll is a guy?

925
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:42,630
Just so you guys know.

926
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:46,250
And he has a girlfriend too.

927
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,510
He had a girlfriend.

928
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:53,350
Soon.

929
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:56,050
Each time you give someone a gift.

930
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:57,170
Give someone you like.

931
00:37:57,410 --> 00:37:59,590
Your friendship with them will grow.

932
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:03,730
They'll also give you gifts in return.

933
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:04,970
Which can be very useful.

934
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:10,210
Try learning what everyone likes and becoming good friends.

935
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:14,910
Oh, and you can only give three gifts a day to each friend.

936
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:17,430
Are you ready to find your friends and give some gifts?

937
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:18,810
Oh, I'm ready.

938
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:19,230
I'm ready.

939
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:20,750
Lovely.

940
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:22,170
Here are the gifts I need delivered.

941
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:23,830
Please be people I like.

942
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:25,230
Hello, kitties.

943
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:25,770
Welcome...

944
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:26,170
Okay.

945
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:27,510
That it?

946
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:34,010
Oh, and don't forget to tell everyone that small gift, big smile, tropical edition is open for your furniture and rooms.

947
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:35,250
Will do.

948
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:37,490
I like how they have the...

949
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:40,610
They have the frog cupboard.

950
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:41,590
Which is similar.

951
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:41,890
Okay.

952
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:43,490
Hello kitty, choco cat.

953
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:44,150
That's...

954
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,150
Oh, it's basically everybody.

955
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:48,710
This is like the frog chair in Animal Crossing.

956
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:50,190
But now...

957
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,830
But now it's like a fucking...

958
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:53,030
Shelf.

959
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:54,530
All right, let's go.

960
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:55,530
We gotta find them.

961
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:59,070
I like the froggy mirror.

962
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:00,830
I mean, it's pretty cute.

963
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:01,610
Okay.

964
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:02,810
Hello kitty is like right here.

965
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:04,570
She's like right here.

966
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:05,810
Jump, jump, jump.

967
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:07,630
Oh, if you hold it...

968
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:08,470
Wait, what shop is this?

969
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:09,470
Is this a coffee shop?

970
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:11,330
Is hello kitty the...

971
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:13,050
The pigeon in this game?

972
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:13,970
Oh my God.

973
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:14,590
Can I sit down?

974
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:16,450
Something seems to be missing.

975
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:16,990
Oh, the...

976
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:17,870
The umbrella.

977
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:19,350
Don't worry, kitty.

978
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:21,450
I'll do your job for you.

979
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:24,090
Wait, how do I put it down?

980
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:24,510
Oh, I see.

981
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:26,010
How do I...

982
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:30,210
Something's missing, but how do I put it down?

983
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:32,430
Collection?

984
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:34,110
No.

985
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:35,870
Can I look at my bag?

986
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:36,570
Oh.

987
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:40,810
Okay.

988
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:41,890
Oh, it doesn't matter.

989
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:42,610
All right, never mind.

990
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:44,270
I can just think about it.

991
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:50,070
I think Hiromi and Batsumaru are...

992
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:51,390
Shut your mouth.

993
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:55,470
Gee.

994
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:56,050
You're so...

995
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:57,850
She need no mat.

996
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:03,250
No, there's no way.

997
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:05,170
She deserves so much better.

998
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:06,210
There's no way.

999
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:08,430
I refuse to let her date Batsumaru.

1000
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:12,390
There's no fucking way.

1001
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:13,450
Oh, good.

1002
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:14,850
I could see Sanrio game.

1003
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:18,610
I was worried about to see something like that Sonic movie maker game.

1004
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:20,130
Guys, thank you for the super chat.

1005
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:20,530
Thank you.

1006
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:20,990
Thank you.

1007
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:23,150
There's no way.

1008
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:23,690
Batsumaru?

1009
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:24,850
No way.

1010
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:25,670
There's no way.

1011
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:26,130
There's no way.

1012
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:26,950
There's...

1013
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:29,550
I refuse to believe that they are a couple.

1014
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:32,450
He is so beneath her.

1015
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:37,290
Oh, I got tofu.

1016
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:38,310
Nice.

1017
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:39,450
New friend.

1018
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:41,830
Let's see.

1019
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:42,050
Here.

1020
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:43,490
Now, new friends with Hello Kitty.

1021
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:44,350
Yay.

1022
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:45,150
Wait.

1023
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,290
What does Hello Kitty want?

1024
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:49,610
Isn't this the cutest cafe?

1025
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:50,550
It's wonderful.

1026
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:53,570
She...

1027
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:54,170
She...

1028
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:55,450
Standards!

1029
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:57,350
Kuromi has standards!

1030
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:00,430
It's even stocked with fresh supplies.

1031
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:03,410
I think I work...

1032
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:06,810
Look at the fucking Sanrio popularity character contest!

1033
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:08,950
Do you know where Bassmaru is?

1034
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:12,150
In the popularity rankings for Sanrio characters?

1035
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:13,850
It's so low!

1036
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:16,870
Kuromi is a top 5!

1037
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:18,750
She's a top 5 gal!

1038
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:21,510
And she deserves a top 5 man!

1039
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:24,850
Anyway, so we can feed our friends when we find them.

1040
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:27,750
Since you're here, do you mind helping me with something?

1041
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:29,010
What do I have to do?

1042
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:30,010
What do you want me to do?

1043
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:32,790
Dan Black...

1044
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:36,010
These padded holders are missing some umbrellas.

1045
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:39,590
I found one across the street and I have a feeling they're scattered around the resort.

1046
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:43,770
Ideally, I like for each table to have an umbrella.

1047
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:45,810
Would you mind seeing...

1048
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:46,510
Oh yeah, that's easy.

1049
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:48,350
Here I come!

1050
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:50,030
Don't worry, I got you, kiddies.

1051
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:52,850
Hahahaha, this thing...

1052
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:53,670
But Kuromi...

1053
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:53,850
NO!

1054
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:56,430
She does not have a crush on Bassmaru!

1055
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:59,570
I refuse to let her have a crush.

1056
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:02,710
Oh, none of this is working?

1057
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:07,850
Kiddy, how can you run a cafe if none of these work- Oh wait, they work!

1058
00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:09,730
Oh I don't have...

1059
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:10,290
Is that a heart?

1060
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:11,170
No, that's a strawberry.

1061
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:12,630
Okay, I was like, what the fuck?

1062
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:15,910
Oh, I can like- Wait, I have to make my own dessert?

1063
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:16,890
That's fucked up.

1064
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:18,910
Keep going.

1065
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:24,390
I refuse.

1066
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:29,350
I refuse to let Kuromi go beneath her standards.

1067
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:36,390
She deserves a top 5 guy for a top 5 Kuromi.

1068
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:40,930
I don't know what creature she is, but she deserves better.

1069
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:48,210
I like how...

1070
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:51,870
Let me put this... Oh, there's a picnic basket!

1071
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:52,930
Can I steal it?

1072
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:53,970
No, I can't.

1073
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:55,230
I can't steal it.

1074
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:57,550
Which place is this?

1075
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:03,770
You know how Kitty has a boyfriend and his name is Dear Daniel?

1076
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:05,570
And she also has a sister?

1077
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:09,770
I forgot her sister's name because no one really cares about her.

1078
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:18,390
But there's this Hello Kitty lie on the internet where if you look up Dear Daniel...

1079
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:19,670
It's like... What was it?

1080
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:24,030
They say Dear Daniel was at... Oh my god, I forgot what the lie was.

1081
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:25,170
I remember I googled it.

1082
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:26,630
Her name is Mimi.

1083
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:28,670
No one cares about Mimi.

1084
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:29,970
No one cares.

1085
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:30,930
She's just Hello Kitty.

1086
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:34,290
Okay, maybe I care a little bit because she has a yellow bow.

1087
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:36,270
Yes, Hello Kitty has a boyfriend!

1088
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:37,750
His name is Dear Daniel.

1089
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:38,490
DDs.

1090
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:39,290
The double Ds.

1091
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:39,750
Uh...

1092
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:42,070
Everyone forgets Mimi.

1093
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:43,150
Thank you.

1094
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:45,530
I forgot Tuxedo Sam existed also.

1095
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:47,890
It's a new vibrant purple cloth.

1096
00:43:48,090 --> 00:43:49,730
I can make good use of it.

1097
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:53,810
Oh, I got thread.

1098
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:56,970
Don't worry, I'll never come back to the store, Tuxedo Sam.

1099
00:43:57,210 --> 00:43:58,470
I don't need clothes.

1100
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:01,190
Yay!

1101
00:44:01,810 --> 00:44:03,850
Alright, this is the last time you'll ever see this guy.

1102
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:07,990
Greetings and salutations!

1103
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:13,330
By pure chance, I stumbled across the perfect location to open a clothing emporium.

1104
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:17,090
Egg Planet... Oh yes!

1105
00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:20,230
Hello Kitty also has a cat called Charming Kitty.

1106
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:22,130
Don't think too hard about it.

1107
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:24,970
Like, don't think... She... She...

1108
00:44:24,970 --> 00:44:28,750
And apparently, like, the creator was like, she's not a cat.

1109
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:34,370
Like, the creator of Hello Kitty was like, Hello Kitty is not a cat.

1110
00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:39,290
To like, justify her owning a cat.

1111
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:43,910
Um, I plan to keep myself very busy until the rest of our party joins us.

1112
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:46,730
Uh, in fact, I already had my first customer!

1113
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:53,130
I had the honor of outfitting Chuckle Cat in explorer wear that was both stylish and functional.

1114
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:56,150
Yeah, it's like a goofy Pluto situation.

1115
00:44:57,950 --> 00:45:02,190
I'll be honored to serve as official clear for a merry ban.

1116
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:03,050
I'll be honored to serve as official clear for a merry ban.

1117
00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:05,390
Let me guess, do you need something?

1118
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:10,530
Well, normally I wouldn't pose, but I'm facing a rather odd dilemma.

1119
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:14,930
I need assistance in displaying and tailoring my designs.

1120
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:18,570
I'm quite at loss without clothing stands to aid me.

1121
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:20,490
Would you mind searching around for some?

1122
00:45:21,070 --> 00:45:26,010
Um, well, guys, if you guys didn't just jump off the plane, you would have all your stuff.

1123
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:29,190
I may see some outside.

1124
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:31,510
Okay, I think... I think, like...

1125
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:33,350
The villagers here are a little stupid.

1126
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:36,110
Like, they literally jumped out of the plane.

1127
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:38,370
And was like, we don't need our luggage.

1128
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:42,750
Alright, we got one clothing stand.

1129
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:45,910
Ooh, let's grab some strawberry crepe.

1130
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:46,570
Wait, what's this?

1131
00:45:47,290 --> 00:45:48,110
What is that?

1132
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:49,730
What is this?

1133
00:45:51,310 --> 00:45:52,270
Funny how that...

1134
00:45:52,270 --> 00:45:53,670
Oh, a comic!

1135
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:55,630
Where did you come from, Batsumaru?

1136
00:45:59,810 --> 00:46:01,070
What's that over there?

1137
00:46:02,570 --> 00:46:02,970
What?

1138
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:03,970
Where the fuck...

1139
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:05,470
Where did he come from?

1140
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:07,730
Monster Envy, thank you for the super chat!

1141
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:08,590
Thank you, thank you!

1142
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:11,210
Part of Hello Kitty's lore is that she is British.

1143
00:46:11,290 --> 00:46:12,610
Oh, yeah, yeah, by the way, she's British.

1144
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:16,110
Hello Kitty, ba-da-ba-da-dum.

1145
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:18,690
I used to watch the Hello Kitty show.

1146
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:21,810
And then, like, I had, like... I remember, like, my parents...

1147
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:26,410
Like, when VCRs were a thing, we taped, like, Hello Kitty episodes and stuff.

1148
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:28,410
I would always... Oh, wait, no, not tape.

1149
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:30,890
We... I had, like... Hello Kitty tapes.

1150
00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:33,930
Of, like, the one with Hansel and Gretel with Hello Kitty.

1151
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:35,950
And then the Hello Kitty and Friends.

1152
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:39,830
Hello Kitty, ba-da-ba-da-bop.

1153
00:46:40,150 --> 00:46:41,350
Hello Kitty.

1154
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:44,630
I mean, you're trying to set a trap for me.

1155
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:46,610
A comic book store would be the bait.

1156
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:49,490
Well, I'm gonna hang around here for now.

1157
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:52,150
Okay.

1158
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:55,590
Alright, so... Wait, am I friends with Batsumaru?

1159
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:58,190
Oh, he has, like... He's a fisherman.

1160
00:46:59,490 --> 00:46:59,930
Okay.

1161
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:04,310
Okay, so that means we can fish in this game, too.

1162
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:06,470
Of course, Batsumaru is the fisherman.

1163
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:09,350
Alright, Batsumaru, I have a gift for you.

1164
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:12,030
Give.

1165
00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:15,430
Small gift, big spell is open?

1166
00:47:15,610 --> 00:47:16,510
I'm totally there!

1167
00:47:16,990 --> 00:47:19,190
Whoa, my Melody gave me some water balloons?

1168
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:22,630
I like how... I think I love how, like...

1169
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:24,770
This was, like, Melody's gifts.

1170
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:30,410
But then, all the villagers are like, Oh my god, Doki, thank you so much for giving it to me.

1171
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:34,690
Oh no, one popped all over me.

1172
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:35,970
Is that a crab in the background?

1173
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:38,650
Does this count as a prank from my Melody?

1174
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,440
I think it's funny that...

1175
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:53,480
That they're like, Wow, Doki, thank you for the gifts that came from my Melody!

1176
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:55,140
We're better friends now!

1177
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:56,660
Oh my god, a magnet.

1178
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:59,040
Okay, three paper and a magnet.

1179
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:00,420
Okay, what do you want, Batsumaru?

1180
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:05,160
Since the water balloon I got from my Melody burst, I want to try and get another one.

1181
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:08,540
I bet we could make one with some of that rubber around here.

1182
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:09,000
What?

1183
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:11,440
Will you collect... what?

1184
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:14,680
Rubber grows... oh!

1185
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:18,540
Rubber grows on trees.

1186
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,640
Usually they grow up on hills, but I also saw one by ChocoCat's tent.

1187
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:26,640
Here, take this.

1188
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:27,600
Then!

1189
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:28,520
Okay.

1190
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,860
Okay, we're gonna grab... find some rubber.

1191
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,000
Water balloon crafting plans.

1192
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,120
Don't we need like a process?

1193
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,200
To like, fucking make rubber?

1194
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:42,440
Once you have the rubber, we can make the crafting...

1195
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:43,060
Oh, there it is!

1196
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:44,200
We got a crafting table too!

1197
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:46,440
Prank preparation.

1198
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:49,820
Stolen present.

1199
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:51,340
Valor garlics!

1200
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:52,420
Thank you for the super chat!

1201
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:53,340
Thank you, thank you!

1202
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,780
Where's Retsuko?

1203
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:57,740
Where's the model?

1204
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:01,540
I don't want to talk to these people.

1205
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:06,400
When can I kick them off my village?

1206
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:07,940
Just like Animal Crossing.

1207
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:14,360
When can I force them out of the village?

1208
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:18,780
So I can have my optimal village.

1209
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:20,360
Oh my god, what is that?

1210
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:21,080
Is that ye?

1211
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,480
I can't catch it yet, cause I don't have a...

1212
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,880
I don't have like a bug net.

1213
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:29,140
Okay, let's grab all of this for...

1214
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:31,200
Fucking tuxedo sham.

1215
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:32,920
Where's the...

1216
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:34,940
There's like one more, but where is it?

1217
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:36,560
What?

1218
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:38,680
There's like one more somewhere here.

1219
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:41,240
The fuck?

1220
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,460
Where's the last one?

1221
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:46,460
It says it's like around here.

1222
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:48,980
But like, we're around here.

1223
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:51,780
Is it like...

1224
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,080
Here somewhere?

1225
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:53,760
Like hiding?

1226
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,420
No.

1227
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:56,060
I'm so confused.

1228
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:57,480
Oh well.

1229
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,460
Let's see who cares about what he wants.

1230
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:00,600
Anyway...

1231
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:01,260
What's that?

1232
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:02,280
Is that a bug?

1233
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:03,760
Oh, it's right here!

1234
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:05,800
Guys.

1235
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,740
Guys, this is not a children's game.

1236
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:10,720
It's actually pretty difficult.

1237
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:15,500
Here you go.

1238
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:16,680
I finished a mission.

1239
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:19,400
This is a very difficult game, guys.

1240
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:25,780
Three cheers for the champion!

1241
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:28,000
You have provided valuable service!

1242
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:28,520
That's me!

1243
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:30,740
I'm currently in your debt.

1244
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:32,400
Yay!

1245
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:34,560
I got another magnet!

1246
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:36,640
Woo!

1247
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:38,020
Okay.

1248
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:39,200
What's this?

1249
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:45,380
Oh, I can trade items for clothes!

1250
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:46,120
No.

1251
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:47,320
We don't need clothes.

1252
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:49,400
What we've learned is that we do not need clothes.

1253
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:50,840
We are perfect.

1254
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:52,100
Guys, look at us.

1255
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:53,160
Oh my god.

1256
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:54,700
That hat is so cute though.

1257
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:56,720
Imagine if I had that hat on.

1258
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:01,060
No, but we don't need it, guys.

1259
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:02,720
We're so beautiful already.

1260
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:04,500
We're wild and free.

1261
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:05,280
Chat.

1262
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:07,920
Wild and free.

1263
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:09,580
Alright.

1264
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:10,900
Oh, he's like the sporty type.

1265
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:14,200
Veggie bread?

1266
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:15,600
Wait, he's a vegetarian?

1267
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:17,960
Is that canon?

1268
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:20,300
Is Pachaco vegetarian canon?

1269
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,140
My melody really knows.

1270
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:24,080
He knows what I like.

1271
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:27,520
Okay.

1272
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:29,020
Strawberries.

1273
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:29,440
Alright.

1274
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:31,980
I like how someone's like, no!

1275
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,180
My Pachaco lore!

1276
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:41,200
The deepest lore.

1277
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:43,140
No!

1278
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:46,640
No!

1279
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,580
The fact that Pachaco's vegetarian.

1280
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:50,200
It's ruined.

1281
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:53,080
Hey, have you seen a little egg throughout the...

1282
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:53,680
No, what?

1283
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:54,760
What little egg?

1284
00:51:57,260 --> 00:51:58,220
Look over there.

1285
00:51:58,520 --> 00:51:59,560
There's one right now.

1286
00:51:59,720 --> 00:51:59,920
Where?

1287
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:00,820
Goop Tama!

1288
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:04,620
There's multiple Goop Tamas?

1289
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:06,520
But what if we took a picture?

1290
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,120
Maybe one of our friends will know.

1291
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:09,900
Here, take my camera.

1292
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,340
Get to where you wanna take a picture.

1293
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:16,480
Press the camera tool and then you can adjust the camera.

1294
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,180
Feel free to strike a pose while you're taking a picture by using your phone.

1295
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:24,140
When you're ready to snap that pic, just press the camera again.

1296
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:25,420
Oh my god!

1297
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:26,460
It's Gautama!

1298
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:27,920
I love Gautama!

1299
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:37,480
I talked about this before, but when I was younger, I bought this little cute Gautama thing.

1300
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:41,220
Where you open the fridge, Gautama would come out of his egg.

1301
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:45,080
So you put the Gautama thing in the egg carton, like in the egg drawer.

1302
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:51,280
And then when you open the fridge, Gautama would come out of his egg and be like, Close the door!

1303
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:54,160
Like in Japanese, and it's so fucking cute.

1304
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:57,760
And it does that every time you open the fridge, so it reminds you to...

1305
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:01,060
It's there to remind you to close the fridge and everything.

1306
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,260
It's so fucking cute.

1307
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:04,640
Oh my god, there he is.

1308
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:05,500
Gautama.

1309
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:07,680
Oh my god, wait.

1310
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:09,860
No, not like this.

1311
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:10,200
Okay.

1312
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:12,220
I need to take a selfie with Gautama.

1313
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:13,840
Oh my god, Gautama.

1314
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:14,500
Give me a sec.

1315
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:16,420
I need to take a selfie.

1316
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:17,520
I love you, Gautama.

1317
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:18,500
No!

1318
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:22,800
Oh my god, it's so difficult to lie to myself next to you.

1319
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:26,080
I need to take a picture with my Oshii.

1320
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:28,620
One of my many Oshii's in Sanio.

1321
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:29,700
Gautama, please.

1322
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:31,180
Gautama!

1323
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:34,320
I wanna face the camera!

1324
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:37,400
Okay.

1325
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:39,760
Alright, let's see.

1326
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:40,080
What's this?

1327
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,700
Oh my god, I could've just done that.

1328
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:42,360
Okay, nice.

1329
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:47,160
Oh my god.

1330
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:47,940
Yes.

1331
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:49,460
Yay.

1332
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:52,260
Accept.

1333
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:56,020
That's so... No!

1334
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,260
He's gone!

1335
00:53:58,720 --> 00:53:59,080
No!

1336
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:05,420
It's like, they give me one freebie and then I'm hooked forever.

1337
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:08,900
That's how they get you.

1338
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:13,460
They give you a freebie and it makes you long for him.

1339
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:14,160
He died.

1340
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:15,420
No!

1341
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:18,720
Gautama!

1342
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:21,420
Gautama!

1343
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,380
Into the picture you go.

1344
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,640
You absorbed him into the picture.

1345
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:28,340
What's this?

1346
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,060
Signs seems like a weird egg creature on it.

1347
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:32,520
Maybe...

1348
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,420
Oh, it's Gautama!

1349
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:34,440
It's Gautama!

1350
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:37,120
Alright, Gautama.

1351
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:37,860
What do you want?

1352
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:39,980
Oh no, I'm not giving you anything.

1353
00:54:43,730 --> 00:54:45,490
What do you want, Pachaco?

1354
00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:47,090
Hot potato!

1355
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:47,870
Nice pick!

1356
00:54:48,010 --> 00:54:49,650
Let's get everyone over here.

1357
00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:50,990
Hey everyone!

1358
00:54:51,430 --> 00:54:53,790
Look at this sick-ass picture!

1359
00:54:54,070 --> 00:54:55,010
The Doki-tuk!

1360
00:54:55,810 --> 00:54:57,570
Guys, you know, it was pretty good though.

1361
00:54:57,770 --> 00:54:58,930
It was... See, I stole.

1362
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:00,050
Gautama stole.

1363
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:04,230
What's going on, Pachaco?

1364
00:55:04,450 --> 00:55:05,230
Game of the year.

1365
00:55:05,310 --> 00:55:06,230
That's what's going on.

1366
00:55:06,370 --> 00:55:07,750
Take a look at this picture.

1367
00:55:07,870 --> 00:55:08,790
Do you know what this is?

1368
00:55:09,070 --> 00:55:09,950
It's Gautama!

1369
00:55:10,910 --> 00:55:12,550
They're called Gautama!

1370
00:55:14,290 --> 00:55:15,810
Strong, thank you for the magenta soup!

1371
00:55:15,950 --> 00:55:17,230
Thank you, thank you!

1372
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:17,890
You fool!

1373
00:55:18,070 --> 00:55:20,130
You fell for the classic plunder!

1374
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:24,970
I first came across them in France when I was training to be a professional baker.

1375
00:55:26,310 --> 00:55:26,830
Gautama!

1376
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:27,670
Huh?

1377
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:28,570
Crazy!

1378
00:55:28,590 --> 00:55:29,690
It's a whole race!

1379
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:30,510
I know, right?

1380
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:30,830
What?

1381
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:35,190
It's funny, they look like lazy things who don't...

1382
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:36,490
Shut your mouth!

1383
00:55:37,790 --> 00:55:40,910
Except, I spot them in every corner of the island.

1384
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:43,930
Did you know I take an island jog every...

1385
00:55:44,530 --> 00:55:45,050
morning?

1386
00:55:45,330 --> 00:55:46,570
I do now.

1387
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:51,770
Look, I want everybody to enjoy the island's rugged challenge and stunning views.

1388
00:55:52,670 --> 00:55:55,970
You can't take a vacation while pushing yourself to the max, right?

1389
00:55:57,450 --> 00:55:59,690
And Gautama can be anywhere, right?

1390
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:01,430
So I'll cut you a deal.

1391
00:56:02,210 --> 00:56:07,070
You can have this camera, but only take pictures with different Gautamas all over the island.

1392
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:10,310
Make sure you strike a rad pose in your picture.

1393
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:13,730
Hehe, I'll give you a hint to start.

1394
00:56:13,830 --> 00:56:16,570
I saw Gautama hanging outside my cafe.

1395
00:56:16,570 --> 00:56:17,810
Oh my god!

1396
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:19,070
Easy, easy.

1397
00:56:19,190 --> 00:56:19,810
No cheating.

1398
00:56:20,590 --> 00:56:22,030
Let's start with six Gautamas.

1399
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:23,450
That's a half a cartoon.

1400
00:56:23,890 --> 00:56:26,190
Also, it has to be a different one in each picture.

1401
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:27,310
Can you handle that?

1402
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:28,490
I was born ready.

1403
00:56:28,850 --> 00:56:30,070
I was born ready.

1404
00:56:30,110 --> 00:56:30,650
I love him.

1405
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:32,570
I love... I love Gautama.

1406
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:39,610
I like how I was like remembering now of like how Nicewig was like, you never say I love you.

1407
00:56:39,710 --> 00:56:43,670
And I'm like, that's not true because I'll say I love you to Gautama.

1408
00:56:47,630 --> 00:56:52,890
You can always return for the sign just to check how many you've taken pictures of.

1409
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:54,510
Gautama deserves it.

1410
00:56:58,770 --> 00:57:00,170
Oh my god.

1411
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:01,630
I love him so much.

1412
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:03,110
I love you Gautama.

1413
00:57:06,330 --> 00:57:07,570
He's so cute.

1414
00:57:09,850 --> 00:57:10,490
Gautama.

1415
00:57:10,490 --> 00:57:12,990
Okay, I will always have like Sanrio phases.

1416
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:15,810
The great Gautama number 10.

1417
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:17,090
The fuck is that?

1418
00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:20,050
What the fuck is the great Gautama?

1419
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:21,930
Okay, let's grab this.

1420
00:57:22,210 --> 00:57:23,330
Got a mystic stone.

1421
00:57:23,790 --> 00:57:24,650
Oh my god.

1422
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:25,430
There's like fishies.

1423
00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:26,410
I can like fish.

1424
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:27,750
Did I drown?

1425
00:57:28,130 --> 00:57:29,050
Oh, whoops.

1426
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:32,590
Oops.

1427
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:34,130
Almost drowned.

1428
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:35,690
Alright, quest.

1429
00:57:36,030 --> 00:57:36,750
What do I have to do?

1430
00:57:37,210 --> 00:57:41,010
The right tools power... What the fuck is all...

1431
00:57:41,010 --> 00:57:42,250
Oh my god.

1432
00:57:42,330 --> 00:57:45,170
I did not realize there's so many quests here.

1433
00:57:46,790 --> 00:57:47,310
Okay.

1434
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:49,190
Power up the gate.

1435
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:50,330
Taco 2.

1436
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:51,930
Okay, we're gonna find Choco Cat.

1437
00:57:52,190 --> 00:57:53,450
We're gonna do the main quest.

1438
00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:55,310
I don't care about the side quest honestly.

1439
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:56,750
Where's my guide?

1440
00:57:57,310 --> 00:57:58,370
Yellow paint time.

1441
00:57:58,610 --> 00:58:00,210
Yellow paint, take me to Choco Cat.

1442
00:58:01,290 --> 00:58:02,090
Yellow paint.

1443
00:58:03,990 --> 00:58:05,210
This is so nice.

1444
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:07,070
Yay!

1445
00:58:07,810 --> 00:58:08,870
Oh, what's this?

1446
00:58:08,970 --> 00:58:10,670
Oh, that's the crafting table for the rubber.

1447
00:58:11,390 --> 00:58:14,450
We have to craft the rubber for Patsumaru.

1448
00:58:15,810 --> 00:58:16,170
What did I get?

1449
00:58:16,550 --> 00:58:18,510
Oh, I got a blank book.

1450
00:58:18,730 --> 00:58:20,550
I can make a story out of this.

1451
00:58:22,230 --> 00:58:23,710
I heard you can play multiplayer.

1452
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:25,710
I saw like the multiplayer like panel.

1453
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:27,650
Hello, Choco Cat.

1454
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:28,230
Oh my god.

1455
00:58:28,270 --> 00:58:29,930
Are they on the other side of that?

1456
00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:34,230
Alright, here's your gift, Choco Cat.

1457
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:36,210
What's this?

1458
00:58:36,290 --> 00:58:37,290
An old photograph?

1459
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:39,970
My Melody found while cleaning up the shop?

1460
00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:41,070
Incredible!

1461
00:58:41,510 --> 00:58:45,410
This might have been taken on the island forever and ever ago.

1462
00:58:46,070 --> 00:58:47,310
Where is this location?

1463
00:58:50,050 --> 00:58:51,830
Please, open the door.

1464
00:58:52,310 --> 00:58:54,270
I need to find Patsumaru.

1465
00:58:55,870 --> 00:58:56,950
Open the door!

1466
00:58:58,870 --> 00:58:59,370
Yay!

1467
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:01,570
Small gift, big smile.

1468
00:59:02,530 --> 00:59:03,030
Okay.

1469
00:59:05,310 --> 00:59:08,230
I'm studying this gate to see how we might be able to open it.

1470
00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:12,690
I think our missing friends must have landed behind this gate to find them.

1471
00:59:12,790 --> 00:59:13,310
You have to...

1472
00:59:13,310 --> 00:59:14,670
Oh my god, how do we open it?

1473
00:59:14,670 --> 00:59:16,050
How do we open it?

1474
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:17,150
Give me Kuromi.

1475
00:59:17,370 --> 00:59:18,750
At least Kuromi.

1476
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:21,070
I was just studying the runes on the door.

1477
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:22,510
Where is Retsuko too?

1478
00:59:22,610 --> 00:59:24,450
No one ever said where Retsuko is.

1479
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:27,770
The door will open with a power source.

1480
00:59:28,050 --> 00:59:30,270
More specifically, yellow power crystal.

1481
00:59:30,630 --> 00:59:31,430
See here?

1482
00:59:31,690 --> 00:59:34,990
It looks like the ancient plans for some kind of power crystal sensor.

1483
00:59:35,270 --> 00:59:37,030
A power crystal sensor?

1484
00:59:39,390 --> 00:59:44,170
If my translation is correct, we'll need three sticks and three magnets...

1485
00:59:44,170 --> 00:59:45,230
to create the power...

1486
00:59:45,230 --> 00:59:46,330
I have two!

1487
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:47,550
I have two magnets!

1488
00:59:48,370 --> 00:59:49,750
I've got what we needed.

1489
00:59:51,910 --> 00:59:53,610
I don't actually...

1490
00:59:54,410 --> 00:59:55,390
Oh, I do!

1491
00:59:57,810 --> 00:59:59,010
Do I actually?

1492
00:59:59,810 --> 01:00:01,850
Wait, do I actually have it?

1493
01:00:01,950 --> 01:00:02,850
I was lying.

1494
01:00:06,390 --> 01:00:08,090
Oh my god, I do!

1495
01:00:09,350 --> 01:00:10,010
Let's go!

1496
01:00:10,550 --> 01:00:12,110
JK, I was not lying.

1497
01:00:15,090 --> 01:00:15,610
Yay!

1498
01:00:16,110 --> 01:00:17,810
I got the crystal sensor!

1499
01:00:21,090 --> 01:00:23,210
The fabled power crystal sensor!

1500
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:27,570
Typical magnets equals magic.

1501
01:00:28,230 --> 01:00:31,090
Guys, science is practically magic, chat.

1502
01:00:32,530 --> 01:00:35,450
Use the sensor, type the button, and select it.

1503
01:00:35,830 --> 01:00:39,410
The closer we are to a yellow power crystal, the faster...

1504
01:00:39,410 --> 01:00:40,970
What is this Chaos Emerald shit?

1505
01:00:41,210 --> 01:00:42,510
The faster it will pulse.

1506
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:44,010
Oh my god, it's like those like...

1507
01:00:44,170 --> 01:00:45,010
metal detectors.

1508
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:45,810
Okay.

1509
01:00:47,490 --> 01:00:49,610
Am I... doing it correctly?

1510
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:51,630
Oh, it's pulsing, right?

1511
01:00:51,710 --> 01:00:52,950
When I get closer to one?

1512
01:00:55,510 --> 01:00:56,450
How do I know?

1513
01:01:01,030 --> 01:01:02,550
ChocoCat, how would I know?

1514
01:01:02,810 --> 01:01:03,890
What the fuck?

1515
01:01:04,590 --> 01:01:05,890
What the fuck is this?

1516
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:09,310
What... what is that?

1517
01:01:10,410 --> 01:01:12,310
What did I spray out?

1518
01:01:13,350 --> 01:01:14,990
Hey look, there's a butterfly.

1519
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:17,270
No!

1520
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:19,290
Where are the crystals?

1521
01:01:20,490 --> 01:01:22,950
Oh, it's like a little mini game!

1522
01:01:23,530 --> 01:01:25,670
Don't worry, I drown.

1523
01:01:26,170 --> 01:01:28,450
Guys, don't worry, I drown.

1524
01:01:33,610 --> 01:01:34,290
No!

1525
01:01:36,170 --> 01:01:38,170
Where is the crystals?

1526
01:01:39,350 --> 01:01:40,450
Am I stuck?

1527
01:01:40,790 --> 01:01:42,250
Oh, I got stuck!

1528
01:01:42,290 --> 01:01:44,050
And it kicked me out!

1529
01:01:45,650 --> 01:01:48,370
I can jump, but like...

1530
01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:49,390
No, Choco!

1531
01:01:49,850 --> 01:01:51,810
Where is the power crystals?

1532
01:01:55,450 --> 01:01:56,050
Please...

1533
01:01:56,050 --> 01:01:58,670
I just wanna find Kuromi.

1534
01:02:02,390 --> 01:02:03,190
It's beeping!

1535
01:02:04,870 --> 01:02:05,670
It's near!

1536
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:08,390
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1537
01:02:10,290 --> 01:02:11,030
It's nearby!

1538
01:02:11,610 --> 01:02:12,510
Where can it be?

1539
01:02:12,610 --> 01:02:12,870
Oh!

1540
01:02:13,030 --> 01:02:13,610
It's here!

1541
01:02:15,610 --> 01:02:17,950
Perhaps if we work together, we'll be able to open it.

1542
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:20,590
You stand over here and I'll stand on the other side.

1543
01:02:21,090 --> 01:02:21,650
That's right!

1544
01:02:23,690 --> 01:02:24,690
We did it!

1545
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:26,690
Oh my god, is this where... is this mining?

1546
01:02:27,370 --> 01:02:28,530
Wait, there's mining?

1547
01:02:29,350 --> 01:02:30,850
What the fuck is this?

1548
01:02:33,610 --> 01:02:34,690
Oh my... what?

1549
01:02:35,010 --> 01:02:35,490
Hahaha!

1550
01:02:36,310 --> 01:02:36,490
Hahaha!

1551
01:02:38,570 --> 01:02:40,990
We're mobile gaming for reals now!

1552
01:02:42,150 --> 01:02:44,570
Oh my god, there's fucking dungeons!

1553
01:02:44,910 --> 01:02:46,710
In my Hello Kitty game!

1554
01:02:48,230 --> 01:02:49,890
This is Minecraft now.

1555
01:02:49,930 --> 01:02:50,950
It's Minecraft time!

1556
01:02:51,490 --> 01:02:53,510
I got stamina apple slice?

1557
01:02:53,690 --> 01:02:56,330
Oh my god, what the fuck am I gonna do with this?

1558
01:02:56,470 --> 01:02:57,650
Oh, I'm climbing.

1559
01:02:58,070 --> 01:03:00,890
What am I gonna do with this stamina apple slice?

1560
01:03:02,730 --> 01:03:03,330
Yay!

1561
01:03:03,490 --> 01:03:05,010
Yellow power crystals!

1562
01:03:05,670 --> 01:03:06,650
Okay, we got...

1563
01:03:06,650 --> 01:03:06,970
Oh!

1564
01:03:07,190 --> 01:03:07,490
Wait!

1565
01:03:07,570 --> 01:03:08,170
I can glide!

1566
01:03:08,690 --> 01:03:09,550
Can I die?

1567
01:03:10,510 --> 01:03:12,590
Oh no, there's a...

1568
01:03:12,590 --> 01:03:13,310
Hahaha!

1569
01:03:13,430 --> 01:03:15,590
I got stuck on the pillar!

1570
01:03:16,450 --> 01:03:19,490
The game was like, trying to kick me out of the pillar.

1571
01:03:20,930 --> 01:03:23,150
Oh my god, we're mobile gaming for real.

1572
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:25,690
How many power crystals do I need?

1573
01:03:26,270 --> 01:03:27,270
Did it tell me?

1574
01:03:27,790 --> 01:03:29,530
I don't remember if it told me.

1575
01:03:32,870 --> 01:03:33,350
Okay.

1576
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:35,610
Did it tell me how many?

1577
01:03:36,990 --> 01:03:37,810
I'm all set.

1578
01:03:39,490 --> 01:03:40,550
Okay, there's no...

1579
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:40,930
They...

1580
01:03:41,570 --> 01:03:43,170
They accounted for like...

1581
01:03:43,170 --> 01:03:44,830
Wait, who the fuck is this guy?

1582
01:03:45,890 --> 01:03:46,770
Who's this guy?

1583
01:03:47,770 --> 01:03:48,290
Hello?

1584
01:03:49,530 --> 01:03:50,870
Is he just gonna stand here?

1585
01:03:50,990 --> 01:03:51,670
Is this a statue?

1586
01:03:51,790 --> 01:03:52,590
Oh, it's a statue!

1587
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:54,370
I thought it was a real person.

1588
01:03:54,650 --> 01:03:55,930
Oh, Choco Cat's dead.

1589
01:03:56,650 --> 01:03:57,170
Whoops.

1590
01:03:57,530 --> 01:03:58,350
Oh, there...

1591
01:03:58,350 --> 01:04:00,030
There he is!

1592
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:06,350
It's like, where did he go?

1593
01:04:07,590 --> 01:04:09,710
Choco Cat, where did you go?

1594
01:04:10,850 --> 01:04:11,250
Stick.

1595
01:04:11,750 --> 01:04:12,790
I'll grab some stick.

1596
01:04:14,510 --> 01:04:15,070
What's this?

1597
01:04:15,230 --> 01:04:15,910
Sand Dollar.

1598
01:04:15,970 --> 01:04:18,010
Oh my god, it's like Animal Crossing Sand Dollars.

1599
01:04:19,970 --> 01:04:21,130
Better than World of Warcraft.

1600
01:04:21,310 --> 01:04:23,170
100% better than World of Warcraft.

1601
01:04:23,690 --> 01:04:24,490
Butters was right.

1602
01:04:26,010 --> 01:04:27,090
Oh, that's the sprint.

1603
01:04:27,250 --> 01:04:28,250
Okay, we don't need to do that.

1604
01:04:28,330 --> 01:04:29,310
We're not gonna play that game.

1605
01:04:29,810 --> 01:04:30,870
Look, this is important!

1606
01:04:31,850 --> 01:04:33,450
We need to find Kuromi!

1607
01:04:33,450 --> 01:04:33,670
Kuromi!

1608
01:04:34,790 --> 01:04:36,150
Please start beeping!

1609
01:04:38,090 --> 01:04:39,030
Start beeping!

1610
01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:41,490
Where is the queen?

1611
01:04:43,790 --> 01:04:45,890
Oh my god, where is it?

1612
01:04:45,930 --> 01:04:47,010
It's not beeping anymore.

1613
01:04:47,670 --> 01:04:48,910
Oh, it's right here!

1614
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:49,450
It's up here!

1615
01:04:50,170 --> 01:04:51,890
Yeah, this game is actually real.

1616
01:04:52,050 --> 01:04:57,210
I think the funniest part for me about this game is the fact that it's like the same type...

1617
01:04:57,210 --> 01:05:02,190
Like, the same name as the Cell Puck reference.

1618
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:03,630
They did that on purpose.

1619
01:05:03,810 --> 01:05:05,530
They had to do that on purpose.

1620
01:05:06,650 --> 01:05:07,770
Just for the memes.

1621
01:05:07,990 --> 01:05:12,950
The other thing is that I can't believe Sanrio JP agreed to it.

1622
01:05:13,070 --> 01:05:14,750
Because this is like NA's idea.

1623
01:05:15,050 --> 01:05:15,730
You know?

1624
01:05:16,010 --> 01:05:18,730
It's obviously like NA's idea to do it.

1625
01:05:18,910 --> 01:05:22,810
So I'm more surprised that JP agreed to it.

1626
01:05:24,230 --> 01:05:25,410
Because you know...

1627
01:05:26,110 --> 01:05:27,830
You know, it's Cell Puck.

1628
01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:30,390
The fact that they agreed to have a reference...

1629
01:05:30,390 --> 01:05:31,210
Like...

1630
01:05:31,210 --> 01:05:32,670
To like Cell Puck...

1631
01:05:33,030 --> 01:05:34,830
In the end is actually crazy.

1632
01:05:36,430 --> 01:05:38,050
Where the fuck is it?

1633
01:05:38,790 --> 01:05:39,390
Weeeeee!

1634
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:42,110
It's so vibrating.

1635
01:05:43,010 --> 01:05:44,290
Is it down here?

1636
01:05:47,530 --> 01:05:48,810
Oh, it's here!

1637
01:05:48,910 --> 01:05:49,030
It's here!

1638
01:05:50,550 --> 01:05:52,070
Oh, it's here!

1639
01:05:52,190 --> 01:05:52,710
I found it!

1640
01:05:53,590 --> 01:05:55,070
It has to be this dungeon.

1641
01:05:56,150 --> 01:05:57,110
No, please.

1642
01:05:57,890 --> 01:05:58,830
Open up.

1643
01:05:59,030 --> 01:05:59,930
Open up!

1644
01:06:01,210 --> 01:06:01,990
I need to see...

1645
01:06:01,990 --> 01:06:03,850
I need to rescue Kuromi!

1646
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:06,530
Oh no, what the fuck?

1647
01:06:07,570 --> 01:06:08,570
There's a puzzle?

1648
01:06:11,230 --> 01:06:11,750
No.

1649
01:06:12,590 --> 01:06:13,910
Oh no, no!

1650
01:06:15,370 --> 01:06:18,610
Okay, we gotta figure this out, guys.

1651
01:06:18,970 --> 01:06:20,210
Oh, I know, I know!

1652
01:06:20,330 --> 01:06:21,730
I put this here.

1653
01:06:23,070 --> 01:06:23,590
Guys.

1654
01:06:24,550 --> 01:06:26,570
Guys, these puzzles are very difficult.

1655
01:06:26,930 --> 01:06:27,450
Children...

1656
01:06:27,450 --> 01:06:29,110
This is why this is not a kids game chat.

1657
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:31,030
This is exactly why.

1658
01:06:31,130 --> 01:06:32,610
This is not a kids game.

1659
01:06:33,470 --> 01:06:36,370
A normal child would not be able to figure this out.

1660
01:06:36,510 --> 01:06:37,310
Unlike me.

1661
01:06:38,410 --> 01:06:38,770
Oop!

1662
01:06:38,770 --> 01:06:40,050
And then...

1663
01:06:40,050 --> 01:06:41,270
Pick that up.

1664
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:42,290
Oop!

1665
01:06:42,350 --> 01:06:42,850
Yay!

1666
01:06:44,090 --> 01:06:44,450
Yay!

1667
01:06:46,390 --> 01:06:48,230
Another power here!

1668
01:06:50,390 --> 01:06:53,070
I got another yellow power crystal!

1669
01:06:53,750 --> 01:06:54,510
Let's go!

1670
01:06:54,810 --> 01:06:56,810
Thanks ChocoCat for not helping.

1671
01:06:59,430 --> 01:07:01,870
Oh no, I need to figure out where the last one is.

1672
01:07:02,730 --> 01:07:03,820
Where is the last...

1673
01:07:05,210 --> 01:07:07,110
Where is the last power crystal?

1674
01:07:07,350 --> 01:07:07,830
Oh, but chest.

1675
01:07:10,430 --> 01:07:11,210
Chest time!

1676
01:07:13,050 --> 01:07:13,890
A flower.

1677
01:07:15,630 --> 01:07:17,210
You know, I was like looking at...

1678
01:07:17,210 --> 01:07:18,570
Wait, is this...

1679
01:07:18,570 --> 01:07:19,050
Oh!

1680
01:07:19,210 --> 01:07:20,150
Should it be this?

1681
01:07:20,990 --> 01:07:22,470
It should be this, right?

1682
01:07:23,170 --> 01:07:23,970
Was I here?

1683
01:07:26,270 --> 01:07:27,250
Oh, it is!

1684
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:28,410
I fucking knew it!

1685
01:07:30,330 --> 01:07:31,190
I knew it!

1686
01:07:32,910 --> 01:07:33,850
Is it though?

1687
01:07:34,190 --> 01:07:34,850
It's not.

1688
01:07:36,450 --> 01:07:37,310
How do I...

1689
01:07:37,310 --> 01:07:38,370
How do I get up?

1690
01:07:39,550 --> 01:07:40,030
Hello?

1691
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:42,330
Oh no, it was just...

1692
01:07:42,330 --> 01:07:43,270
It's just a normal chest.

1693
01:07:43,490 --> 01:07:44,450
Okay, this doesn't matter.

1694
01:07:45,690 --> 01:07:46,990
This doesn't matter.

1695
01:07:47,010 --> 01:07:48,070
It's just a normal chest.

1696
01:07:48,430 --> 01:07:49,190
Wait, where's ChocoCat?

1697
01:07:50,110 --> 01:07:51,390
Where did ChocoCat go?

1698
01:07:51,810 --> 01:07:52,690
It left me.

1699
01:07:53,690 --> 01:07:54,210
ChocoCat?

1700
01:07:54,310 --> 01:07:55,330
Oh, it's this way.

1701
01:07:58,490 --> 01:07:59,010
ChocoCat?

1702
01:07:59,630 --> 01:08:00,570
Just a moment.

1703
01:08:02,410 --> 01:08:03,230
Where is he?

1704
01:08:04,570 --> 01:08:05,670
Take a look at that!

1705
01:08:05,930 --> 01:08:06,610
What, the tree?

1706
01:08:08,670 --> 01:08:09,950
Oh, it's over here!

1707
01:08:10,830 --> 01:08:15,490
The power crystal sensor indicates a yellow power crystal on the island over there.

1708
01:08:18,550 --> 01:08:21,190
But this bridge will not sophisticate us across.

1709
01:08:21,190 --> 01:08:23,330
My melody is quite handy.

1710
01:08:23,470 --> 01:08:24,610
Perhaps she will be able to help.

1711
01:08:24,750 --> 01:08:26,070
Why not to get her to help?

1712
01:08:27,630 --> 01:08:28,850
She's gonna ask...

1713
01:08:28,850 --> 01:08:29,510
What the fuck?

1714
01:08:29,530 --> 01:08:30,250
Where did you come from?

1715
01:08:30,590 --> 01:08:32,470
She's gonna ask me to get her something.

1716
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:34,910
Like, she's not gonna do it for free.

1717
01:08:35,170 --> 01:08:36,830
She's the Tom Nook of...

1718
01:08:36,830 --> 01:08:38,170
Of Sanrio...

1719
01:08:38,170 --> 01:08:39,330
Hello Kitty Island Adventure.

1720
01:08:40,570 --> 01:08:42,070
She doesn't do shit for free.

1721
01:08:42,130 --> 01:08:43,810
And I don't think she does it for free either.

1722
01:08:46,210 --> 01:08:47,270
A broken bridge?

1723
01:08:47,510 --> 01:08:48,550
I may be able to help.

1724
01:08:48,870 --> 01:08:51,170
I bought a lot of thrilling materials and I'm gonna get it.

1725
01:08:51,170 --> 01:08:52,710
I'm gonna get a dozen of strawberry crates when we came.

1726
01:08:52,990 --> 01:08:54,590
I haven't found them all yet.

1727
01:08:54,770 --> 01:08:54,970
See?

1728
01:08:55,130 --> 01:08:55,950
I told you.

1729
01:08:56,550 --> 01:08:58,550
If you can find two strawberry crates...

1730
01:08:58,550 --> 01:08:59,370
Oh, I have those already.

1731
01:08:59,590 --> 01:09:00,010
Never mind.

1732
01:09:00,070 --> 01:09:00,690
I already have it.

1733
01:09:03,850 --> 01:09:04,250
Perfect!

1734
01:09:04,570 --> 01:09:06,710
Give me those to me and we'll look at that bridge.

1735
01:09:06,930 --> 01:09:07,470
Oh, thank God.

1736
01:09:07,530 --> 01:09:08,650
Thank God I picked up everything.

1737
01:09:10,130 --> 01:09:11,490
Bringing the strawberry crates.

1738
01:09:11,630 --> 01:09:11,930
All right.

1739
01:09:12,730 --> 01:09:13,130
Yay.

1740
01:09:13,190 --> 01:09:14,670
Oh, I have like fucking eight.

1741
01:09:15,650 --> 01:09:16,930
Oh, you found the crates!

1742
01:09:17,010 --> 01:09:17,490
Nice work!

1743
01:09:18,430 --> 01:09:21,150
Let's go to that broken bridge and get it fixed up.

1744
01:09:22,110 --> 01:09:22,690
Let's go.

1745
01:09:24,010 --> 01:09:25,850
My Melody Avatar palette.

1746
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:26,950
Oh, I don't need that.

1747
01:09:27,030 --> 01:09:28,030
I'm already the perfect color.

1748
01:09:28,350 --> 01:09:29,550
I'm the dragon colors.

1749
01:09:31,310 --> 01:09:32,010
All right.

1750
01:09:32,070 --> 01:09:32,890
Come on, Melody!

1751
01:09:33,170 --> 01:09:35,070
Go do the work now for me.

1752
01:09:35,270 --> 01:09:36,170
So I can...

1753
01:09:36,170 --> 01:09:42,350
So I can like be friends with your cooler, hotter roommate slash sister slash cousin.

1754
01:09:46,030 --> 01:09:47,410
All right, Melody.

1755
01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:48,490
You built that bridge.

1756
01:09:50,090 --> 01:09:51,130
Let's see what we can do.

1757
01:09:51,150 --> 01:09:51,730
What can we do with this?

1758
01:09:55,290 --> 01:09:56,130
Oh my God.

1759
01:09:56,470 --> 01:09:57,510
She's so handy.

1760
01:09:59,730 --> 01:10:00,250
Wow.

1761
01:10:02,970 --> 01:10:03,490
There.

1762
01:10:03,590 --> 01:10:03,970
Ta-da!

1763
01:10:04,050 --> 01:10:04,670
All fixed.

1764
01:10:05,730 --> 01:10:06,790
Wait, what is that?

1765
01:10:08,510 --> 01:10:09,230
What's what?

1766
01:10:09,630 --> 01:10:11,910
I got three sticks from the extra.

1767
01:10:12,030 --> 01:10:12,750
I guess like she...

1768
01:10:13,350 --> 01:10:15,870
She like couldn't finish using all these sticks.

1769
01:10:16,850 --> 01:10:18,670
How did she do that?

1770
01:10:19,210 --> 01:10:19,870
Oh, wow.

1771
01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:20,910
It's wonderful.

1772
01:10:20,910 --> 01:10:21,130
I'm so happy.

1773
01:10:21,150 --> 01:10:21,850
Oh, what?

1774
01:10:22,130 --> 01:10:24,650
You don't see the infinite potential in this place.

1775
01:10:24,790 --> 01:10:25,690
Wait, is this my new home?

1776
01:10:26,410 --> 01:10:30,230
It just needs some tender loving care and I'll become a beautiful house.

1777
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:34,410
We can fix this place up with three more strawberry crates.

1778
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:39,990
Once you have them, use the sign outside of the visitor cabin to start repairs.

1779
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:41,950
Where's the visitor cabin?

1780
01:10:42,370 --> 01:10:43,090
This one?

1781
01:10:45,330 --> 01:10:45,830
Oh.

1782
01:10:47,210 --> 01:10:49,210
Oh, some more friends will show up.

1783
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:50,150
Oh my God.

1784
01:10:50,290 --> 01:10:50,790
Yes.

1785
01:10:50,790 --> 01:10:52,590
Yes, I have it.

1786
01:10:52,670 --> 01:10:52,950
Please.

1787
01:10:53,370 --> 01:10:53,890
Please.

1788
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:55,230
I have it.

1789
01:10:58,550 --> 01:10:59,910
Let's fix this place up.

1790
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:01,510
Please.

1791
01:11:01,970 --> 01:11:02,790
So tomorrow...

1792
01:11:03,590 --> 01:11:04,790
Please come visit.

1793
01:11:05,850 --> 01:11:06,830
Isn't it beautiful?

1794
01:11:07,230 --> 01:11:10,290
It feels so much better that we worked on it together.

1795
01:11:12,070 --> 01:11:14,770
These homes can be found all over the island.

1796
01:11:15,130 --> 01:11:19,930
Decorate and customize them to attract visitors like dear Daniel.

1797
01:11:20,150 --> 01:11:20,770
And more.

1798
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:21,310
And more.

1799
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:22,910
And more.

1800
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:23,270
And more.

1801
01:11:24,330 --> 01:11:24,890
And more.

1802
01:11:26,190 --> 01:11:26,750
Oh my God.

1803
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:29,470
The better you decorate it to your taste, the better...

1804
01:11:29,470 --> 01:11:33,450
Aw I just need to decorate it to look like, look like Santa Mara's house.

1805
01:11:33,770 --> 01:11:35,470
Oh you fucking...

1806
01:11:35,470 --> 01:11:36,670
This is how they get you.

1807
01:11:36,850 --> 01:11:38,470
This is how they get you.

1808
01:11:39,650 --> 01:11:45,510
I think Melody was like, come to my store and buy the furniture for the ones you want.

1809
01:11:45,710 --> 01:11:47,410
Oh my God.

1810
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:49,590
You bitch!

1811
01:11:50,210 --> 01:11:50,770
No.

1812
01:11:53,230 --> 01:11:56,290
Oh my god, I'm so sad!

1813
01:11:59,850 --> 01:12:01,830
This is how they get you.

1814
01:12:02,070 --> 01:12:03,770
This is how they get you.

1815
01:12:06,010 --> 01:12:08,010
What do I get from this though?

1816
01:12:08,990 --> 01:12:09,590
Weeeeee.

1817
01:12:09,590 --> 01:12:11,250
Oh shit, I went the wrong way.

1818
01:12:11,870 --> 01:12:12,470
Weeeeee.

1819
01:12:12,470 --> 01:12:14,690
Oh shit, I went the wrong way again.

1820
01:12:15,190 --> 01:12:19,130
Guys, I don't think I'm gonna fucking do this challenge correctly.

1821
01:12:20,290 --> 01:12:20,930
Weeeeee.

1822
01:12:21,030 --> 01:12:21,990
Unless- No!

1823
01:12:22,250 --> 01:12:23,410
Oh hey, I got a crate though.

1824
01:12:24,170 --> 01:12:25,930
You stopped yourself.

1825
01:12:27,230 --> 01:12:29,470
Guys, I was very mad.

1826
01:12:34,090 --> 01:12:37,790
I might have got a little toxic.

1827
01:12:38,110 --> 01:12:39,850
I can't believe it.

1828
01:12:39,930 --> 01:12:42,870
I can't believe this is how she's getting me.

1829
01:12:45,530 --> 01:12:46,170
No!

1830
01:12:46,490 --> 01:12:47,290
Oh no!

1831
01:12:47,390 --> 01:12:48,870
How do I get out of here?

1832
01:12:48,890 --> 01:12:49,110
Oh no.

1833
01:12:49,130 --> 01:12:49,570
Oh, he's right here.

1834
01:12:49,670 --> 01:12:50,230
No!

1835
01:12:50,390 --> 01:12:53,070
You can't swim for longer than two seconds!

1836
01:12:56,170 --> 01:12:57,090
Okay, here we go.

1837
01:12:57,270 --> 01:12:57,930
Oh no.

1838
01:12:58,050 --> 01:13:00,350
I'm like trying to remember how to fucking get back.

1839
01:13:02,010 --> 01:13:06,350
He's gonna want those wacky digits on the back of the cart if I knew it.

1840
01:13:06,430 --> 01:13:08,770
I knew there was a pay to win feature.

1841
01:13:08,930 --> 01:13:11,810
You actually have to pay to get your favorite villagers.

1842
01:13:12,290 --> 01:13:15,250
It's like the amiibo cart's all over again!

1843
01:13:15,750 --> 01:13:18,930
It's like the eBay store for that fucking cat!

1844
01:13:18,930 --> 01:13:20,210
And the Animal Crossing!

1845
01:13:24,550 --> 01:13:27,130
Yay, I got the power crystal!

1846
01:13:27,810 --> 01:13:29,510
That's messed up!

1847
01:13:30,810 --> 01:13:32,310
I just run a- No!

1848
01:13:35,630 --> 01:13:38,750
Tom Nook is nothing compared to my melody!

1849
01:13:40,710 --> 01:13:42,210
I need- I can't.

1850
01:13:42,270 --> 01:13:44,410
I need that- I need Sunamoro.

1851
01:13:44,710 --> 01:13:46,610
Does she have Sunamoro furniture?

1852
01:13:47,770 --> 01:13:50,170
She doesn't even have Sunamoro furniture!

1853
01:13:51,310 --> 01:13:56,690
In order to get friends and family to visit our island, we need to decorate the visitor cabins to your taste.

1854
01:13:56,950 --> 01:14:00,310
And to order- And in order to decorate cabins, you need furniture.

1855
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:03,110
Luckily, you can buy furniture here.

1856
01:14:03,530 --> 01:14:04,170
Of course.

1857
01:14:04,470 --> 01:14:05,750
Of course I can.

1858
01:14:08,390 --> 01:14:09,490
What should I buy?

1859
01:14:10,870 --> 01:14:13,330
Well, different visitors have different tastes.

1860
01:14:13,810 --> 01:14:16,230
Why don't you open the visitors app on your phone?

1861
01:14:18,670 --> 01:14:21,370
There you see what dear Dan- I don't want dear Daniel.

1862
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:24,430
Why are you pushing dear Daniel onto me?

1863
01:14:26,450 --> 01:14:28,070
I didn't call Daniel?

1864
01:14:28,670 --> 01:14:29,710
Oh my god.

1865
01:14:29,890 --> 01:14:32,230
Find dear Daniel's likes on your phone.

1866
01:14:32,590 --> 01:14:35,050
Bro, I don't want him on my island!

1867
01:14:39,150 --> 01:14:39,670
Alright.

1868
01:14:40,250 --> 01:14:41,230
Where is he?

1869
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:43,090
Why does that- Why?

1870
01:14:43,450 --> 01:14:43,870
Why?

1871
01:14:44,010 --> 01:14:44,530
Daniel!

1872
01:14:44,530 --> 01:14:46,230
I don't want him!

1873
01:14:47,630 --> 01:14:49,210
What the fuck do I look at?

1874
01:14:49,590 --> 01:14:50,350
Oh, visitors.

1875
01:14:50,530 --> 01:14:51,150
Here you go.

1876
01:14:51,370 --> 01:14:52,430
Oh my god.

1877
01:14:52,530 --> 01:14:53,990
Who the fuck are these guys?

1878
01:14:55,910 --> 01:14:56,790
Oh, grandma?

1879
01:14:57,230 --> 01:15:00,830
This is your gr- Why would I get your fucking grandma, Melody?

1880
01:15:06,650 --> 01:15:07,130
Melody!

1881
01:15:07,130 --> 01:15:10,350
Work on your own relations with your grandma?

1882
01:15:10,450 --> 01:15:12,850
Why do you have to pay for your grandma's furniture?

1883
01:15:12,850 --> 01:15:15,510
I was like, who is this?

1884
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:19,050
Mickey, my Melody's grandpa?

1885
01:15:19,630 --> 01:15:20,230
Tam?

1886
01:15:22,270 --> 01:15:24,370
There's more of the penguins?

1887
01:15:24,870 --> 01:15:26,190
Tam and Pam?

1888
01:15:27,010 --> 01:15:28,310
Who's- Oh, okay.

1889
01:15:28,370 --> 01:15:30,170
He's Tuxedo's younger brother.

1890
01:15:30,410 --> 01:15:30,770
Okay.

1891
01:15:30,850 --> 01:15:32,670
Pam is the younger brother.

1892
01:15:32,850 --> 01:15:33,110
Okay.

1893
01:15:35,890 --> 01:15:37,550
Your whole family?

1894
01:15:37,870 --> 01:15:38,530
Hahaha!

1895
01:15:40,010 --> 01:15:40,690
Hahaha!

1896
01:15:41,690 --> 01:15:45,990
I like- I like it's like her whole entire family!

1897
01:15:46,390 --> 01:15:51,210
Why do I need to fucking buy furniture for your entire family?

1898
01:15:52,010 --> 01:15:52,570
Melody!

1899
01:15:54,470 --> 01:15:56,010
Not even Sam.

1900
01:15:56,430 --> 01:15:57,370
I know, right?

1901
01:15:57,450 --> 01:15:58,310
What happened to Sam?

1902
01:15:58,550 --> 01:15:59,350
Okay, Daniel.

1903
01:15:59,610 --> 01:16:00,290
Where is Daniel?

1904
01:16:00,430 --> 01:16:03,170
Must be in Seaside Resort to be near- Oh, kitty.

1905
01:16:03,450 --> 01:16:05,990
He's like, you gotta be near my girlfriend.

1906
01:16:06,430 --> 01:16:06,690
Hahaha!

1907
01:16:08,190 --> 01:16:08,750
Okay.

1908
01:16:08,750 --> 01:16:08,990
Alright.

1909
01:16:09,610 --> 01:16:13,630
Dear Daniel is a charming, sophisticated world traveler and photographer.

1910
01:16:14,250 --> 01:16:15,390
Boyfriend to Hello Kitty.

1911
01:16:15,650 --> 01:16:18,730
He has a keen eye for- Wait, he's a fucking photographer now?

1912
01:16:19,110 --> 01:16:22,530
Must have three pieces- I like how he's just like, I just want furniture.

1913
01:16:22,930 --> 01:16:25,350
And must have mama's apple pie.

1914
01:16:26,430 --> 01:16:28,490
Oh yeah, cause they're like, they like apple pie.

1915
01:16:29,030 --> 01:16:30,190
I remember that.

1916
01:16:30,670 --> 01:16:31,230
Okay.

1917
01:16:31,330 --> 01:16:36,490
I can't believe she's making me buy furniture for her fucking entire family!

1918
01:16:36,850 --> 01:16:38,450
That's so messed up, Melody.

1919
01:16:38,750 --> 01:16:39,850
Did you check?

1920
01:16:39,890 --> 01:16:41,050
Yes, I did.

1921
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:46,750
It looks like dear Daniel likes mama's apple pie and three pretty pieces of N furniture.

1922
01:16:47,970 --> 01:16:50,050
Why don't you get something for him now?

1923
01:16:51,310 --> 01:16:51,870
Okay.

1924
01:16:54,890 --> 01:16:55,450
Okay.

1925
01:16:59,670 --> 01:17:02,790
I guess I'll get a kawaii alarm clock.

1926
01:17:04,150 --> 01:17:04,710
Alright.

1927
01:17:05,330 --> 01:17:06,330
Here we go.

1928
01:17:07,850 --> 01:17:09,370
Tuxedo Sam's younger recolor.

1929
01:17:09,950 --> 01:17:11,470
Karlox, thank you for the super chat.

1930
01:17:11,570 --> 01:17:12,490
Thank you, thank you.

1931
01:17:12,810 --> 01:17:15,590
Kaz, yeah, happy with just three pieces of furniture.

1932
01:17:15,890 --> 01:17:17,510
Yeah, he's a guy, alright.

1933
01:17:17,710 --> 01:17:24,010
Yeah, as long as he's close to his girlfriend and also like, um, and also just has three pieces of furniture.

1934
01:17:24,270 --> 01:17:25,650
Doesn't need to be a bed.

1935
01:17:25,790 --> 01:17:26,750
Just like, furniture.

1936
01:17:26,970 --> 01:17:28,090
That's all that matters.

1937
01:17:28,950 --> 01:17:33,050
Okay, we need a- I'm so sad.

1938
01:17:34,370 --> 01:17:36,310
I'm actually so sad.

1939
01:17:36,330 --> 01:17:41,570
That- that- that- that Sonamoro isn't in the guest list.

1940
01:17:44,230 --> 01:17:46,410
TV, PC, and PS5.

1941
01:17:46,590 --> 01:18:00,970
I love that there's like this Reddit where it was like, um, you know when it's a guy's room or like a guy's studio apartment due to like the pictures of like- The pictures of the fucking apartment or studio apartment.

1942
01:18:01,250 --> 01:18:09,450
And it's literally like- It's like there's nothing on the walls or it's- There's sometimes nothing on the walls and it's just a bed.

1943
01:18:11,530 --> 01:18:13,610
Yeah, is it male's living spaces?

1944
01:18:14,830 --> 01:18:18,750
Okay, we gotta- We gotta put the yellow gears on.

1945
01:18:20,450 --> 01:18:22,910
Look, if it works, it works exactly.

1946
01:18:23,850 --> 01:18:25,210
That's all that matters.

1947
01:18:29,490 --> 01:18:30,010
Guys.

1948
01:18:31,090 --> 01:18:33,750
I'm so sad that I might have to buy a new iPad.

1949
01:18:37,590 --> 01:18:40,990
I can't- I can't open the resort gate.

1950
01:18:41,310 --> 01:18:45,910
I was like- I can't- guys, I can't keep using my dad's iPad for this game.

1951
01:18:49,290 --> 01:18:52,850
Well, we- now we can explore the inner sanctum of the island.

1952
01:18:53,590 --> 01:18:55,830
I'm so happy to have been a part of this.

1953
01:18:55,910 --> 01:18:58,210
Thank you so- Huh?

1954
01:18:58,510 --> 01:19:00,470
Oh my god, it's a robot!

1955
01:19:03,050 --> 01:19:03,590
Look!

1956
01:19:03,870 --> 01:19:06,030
The gate is projecting a holographic image!

1957
01:19:07,990 --> 01:19:13,230
I saved money from not- like, GamerSubs was like, Don't worry, Doki.

1958
01:19:13,410 --> 01:19:15,610
You don't have to pay for the prize pool anymore.

1959
01:19:15,910 --> 01:19:22,910
And now I'm spending the prize- I'm spending the money which I would have given for the prize pool for a new iPad.

1960
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:24,270
I was like, yay!

1961
01:19:24,370 --> 01:19:25,490
I got to save money!

1962
01:19:25,590 --> 01:19:31,430
And I'm like, well, gotta spend that business expense on the iPad for street.

1963
01:19:33,590 --> 01:19:34,630
Where am I?

1964
01:19:34,730 --> 01:19:35,010
Hello?

1965
01:19:35,010 --> 01:19:35,210
Hello?

1966
01:19:36,930 --> 01:19:37,530
Hello?

1967
01:19:39,410 --> 01:19:41,150
Whoa, you're sensing it?

1968
01:19:42,230 --> 01:19:45,790
Oh no, it's her situation all over again.

1969
01:19:47,330 --> 01:19:50,170
Oh no, ChocoCat's falling in love.

1970
01:19:50,850 --> 01:19:53,590
What algorithms were you used in your coding?

1971
01:19:55,570 --> 01:19:58,610
Do you use neural networks to process information?

1972
01:20:01,990 --> 01:20:03,450
Balargus, thank you for the super chat.

1973
01:20:03,510 --> 01:20:04,250
Thank you, thank you.

1974
01:20:04,250 --> 01:20:09,910
I never bought posters for my college dorm until one day my mom got frustrated and brought me more.

1975
01:20:10,170 --> 01:20:11,230
Thank you for the super chat.

1976
01:20:11,290 --> 01:20:11,890
Thank you, thank you.

1977
01:20:11,950 --> 01:20:12,510
Oh, sorry.

1978
01:20:12,650 --> 01:20:13,610
I'm ChocoCat.

1979
01:20:13,750 --> 01:20:14,710
Nice to meet you.

1980
01:20:16,970 --> 01:20:17,790
What's your name?

1981
01:20:19,410 --> 01:20:20,310
Nice to meet you.

1982
01:20:20,370 --> 01:20:21,430
I'm Top Hat.

1983
01:20:21,690 --> 01:20:22,730
Yes, Top Hat.

1984
01:20:23,690 --> 01:20:25,070
So, do you live here?

1985
01:20:25,290 --> 01:20:28,330
We only just arrived on the island not long ago.

1986
01:20:30,230 --> 01:20:31,630
Um, I don't know.

1987
01:20:31,710 --> 01:20:32,990
I can't remember anything.

1988
01:20:34,510 --> 01:20:35,630
Nothing at all?

1989
01:20:35,890 --> 01:20:37,250
That's odd.

1990
01:20:39,650 --> 01:20:43,110
Well, except I was floating way up high.

1991
01:20:43,990 --> 01:20:44,930
I saw that too.

1992
01:20:44,990 --> 01:20:46,250
You're floating over the island.

1993
01:20:46,930 --> 01:20:49,130
Yes, but what were you doing up there?

1994
01:20:49,310 --> 01:20:50,230
Did you...

1995
01:20:51,310 --> 01:20:55,070
Did your plane cake make your mouth function like ours?

1996
01:20:55,790 --> 01:20:57,410
What happened to that plane?

1997
01:20:57,850 --> 01:20:59,870
Is that plane gonna crash somewhere?

1998
01:21:00,010 --> 01:21:02,910
We never went back to the plane situation.

1999
01:21:07,260 --> 01:21:10,440
Well, maybe inside the theme park we'll find some things that will help you.

2000
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:11,260
Like more crystals.

2001
01:21:11,660 --> 01:21:12,980
Would you like to join us?

2002
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:15,340
I think...

2003
01:21:16,980 --> 01:21:17,420
Grrrrr...

2004
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:20,840
I hope he's okay.

2005
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:23,920
Me too, ChocoCat.

2006
01:21:23,940 --> 01:21:24,500
Me too.

2007
01:21:24,860 --> 01:21:25,960
Well, let's go in.

2008
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,480
Maybe we can find a way to help him.

2009
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:29,400
Alright, time to help him.

2010
01:21:30,060 --> 01:21:32,780
It's at the bottom of the... What the fuck?

2011
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:33,820
Where did you come from?

2012
01:21:33,820 --> 01:21:35,560
Okay, I'm gonna use the bathroom real quick, guys.

2013
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:38,500
But I'm gonna make sure to hide...

2014
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:40,520
I'm just worried about my AFK.

2015
01:21:40,660 --> 01:21:41,460
I'll be right back.

2016
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:43,080
I'm gonna use the bathroom real quick, chat.

2017
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:04,820
I'm back!

2018
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:05,700
Sorry, I'm gonna need a massage.

2019
01:24:07,620 --> 01:24:08,460
Guys, I'm back.

2020
01:24:08,620 --> 01:24:08,940
Alright.

2021
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:10,800
Alright, ChocoCat.

2022
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:12,880
Am I finally gonna find Kuromi?

2023
01:24:13,640 --> 01:24:15,200
Alright, the whole park?

2024
01:24:16,420 --> 01:24:18,620
I can't wait to see what's out there!

2025
01:24:18,620 --> 01:24:20,860
There's so much more to explore!

2026
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:26,220
I hope you'll be able to find the rest of our friends and deliver their welcome gifts.

2027
01:24:27,860 --> 01:24:32,160
And I hope that we can find out more about our new holographic friend.

2028
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:35,500
Yay!

2029
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:39,020
Can I... Can I find Kuromi?

2030
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:43,060
I can't... I just wanna find Kuromi!

2031
01:24:45,420 --> 01:24:47,020
Oops, I dropped an orange.

2032
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,160
Oh my god!

2033
01:24:51,460 --> 01:24:52,060
Please!

2034
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:56,940
Where is he?

2035
01:24:57,380 --> 01:24:58,420
Decorate the cabin!

2036
01:24:58,540 --> 01:25:00,180
No, we are not decorating anything.

2037
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:01,860
Who is this?

2038
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:03,500
What is this?

2039
01:25:05,020 --> 01:25:06,720
Oh my god, there's like stamina.

2040
01:25:06,780 --> 01:25:08,240
I just noticed the stamina.

2041
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:09,020
Wait!

2042
01:25:09,140 --> 01:25:10,180
I see her!

2043
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:11,320
Guys!

2044
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:13,160
Guys!

2045
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:14,600
We gotta climb!

2046
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:16,980
I see her on my map!

2047
01:25:18,620 --> 01:25:19,640
Oh my god!

2048
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:20,860
Oh, the frames!

2049
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:25,420
What did I get?

2050
01:25:25,820 --> 01:25:26,800
A strap.

2051
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:29,520
Oh my god, there's a frog too!

2052
01:25:30,380 --> 01:25:32,100
Oh, I can't swim guys.

2053
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:34,200
She's on the mini map!

2054
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:37,900
Guys, we're gonna find her guys!

2055
01:25:38,340 --> 01:25:41,320
We just gotta figure out how to get across.

2056
01:25:41,740 --> 01:25:43,440
How to get across!

2057
01:25:44,300 --> 01:25:45,460
Oh my god!

2058
01:25:45,580 --> 01:25:48,600
This entire area is like...

2059
01:25:52,700 --> 01:25:54,080
I'm not decorating!

2060
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:55,560
I don't care about Daniel!

2061
01:25:56,140 --> 01:25:58,700
I just wanna find Kuromi!

2062
01:25:59,460 --> 01:26:03,220
They're like, please, please Doki, just decorate!

2063
01:26:07,780 --> 01:26:11,780
I like how the game is just like, decorate please!

2064
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:13,400
We just need you to decorate!

2065
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:17,560
I don't care about Daniel!

2066
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:20,200
Just give me Kuromi!

2067
01:26:20,380 --> 01:26:21,140
Oh hey, flower!

2068
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:23,020
Oh, swamp mallow!

2069
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:25,180
How the fuck do I get across?

2070
01:26:25,780 --> 01:26:27,840
I will find you Kuromi!

2071
01:26:29,220 --> 01:26:30,600
Oh wait, there's a chest though!

2072
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:31,160
There's a chest!

2073
01:26:31,700 --> 01:26:33,100
Give me a sec, I got distracted.

2074
01:26:37,740 --> 01:26:38,260
Yeah!

2075
01:26:38,260 --> 01:26:39,380
I got pants!

2076
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:46,120
Guys, you think the game is telling me something?

2077
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:47,260
No...

2078
01:26:48,980 --> 01:26:51,360
Guys, it's so funny!

2079
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:52,740
The game gave me pants!

2080
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:54,340
I wonder why?

2081
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:56,960
No pants for this dragon!

2082
01:26:57,260 --> 01:26:58,720
This dragon doesn't need pants!

2083
01:26:58,800 --> 01:26:59,240
Oh, coconut!

2084
01:27:00,140 --> 01:27:00,980
Oh no!

2085
01:27:01,180 --> 01:27:03,380
Did I softlock myself accidentally?

2086
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:05,080
There's no way!

2087
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:11,000
Okay, we'll figure out how to get around this!

2088
01:27:11,240 --> 01:27:13,000
Dude, don't worry!

2089
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:14,780
Don't worry!

2090
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:16,100
We're gonna figure it out!

2091
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:17,320
We'll figure out how to get around it!

2092
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:18,020
Oh, it's like...

2093
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:19,900
Can I climb up this?

2094
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:22,140
Oh shit!

2095
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:22,800
Okay, we're fine!

2096
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:24,020
We're fine!

2097
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:24,420
We're fine!

2098
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:24,760
We're fine!

2099
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:25,460
There's no way!

2100
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:26,920
There's no way!

2101
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,180
There must be a way for me to get across, right?

2102
01:27:30,660 --> 01:27:31,580
Oh yes, there is!

2103
01:27:31,780 --> 01:27:32,660
Oh thank god!

2104
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:34,560
Oh thank god I didn't fuck up!

2105
01:27:34,820 --> 01:27:36,040
Lily pad leap, okay.

2106
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:37,640
Kuromi!

2107
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:39,320
Oh my queen!

2108
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:41,080
Oh my god!

2109
01:27:48,650 --> 01:27:49,050
Boo!

2110
01:27:50,890 --> 01:27:51,290
Gotcha!

2111
01:27:51,290 --> 01:27:52,010
Gotcha, didn't I?

2112
01:27:52,750 --> 01:27:53,850
You got me good!

2113
01:27:54,050 --> 01:27:54,970
Of course you did!

2114
01:27:55,530 --> 01:27:56,230
She's here!

2115
01:27:57,110 --> 01:28:00,090
Sorry, but I can't resist giving a good jump scare.

2116
01:28:00,670 --> 01:28:03,990
I was born on Halloween, so it's in my blood.

2117
01:28:04,190 --> 01:28:05,390
I guess that makes sense.

2118
01:28:05,450 --> 01:28:06,450
Of course, you're always right.

2119
01:28:06,650 --> 01:28:07,350
My queen.

2120
01:28:08,770 --> 01:28:10,490
Pleased to meet you, by the way.

2121
01:28:10,570 --> 01:28:11,470
I'm Kuromi.

2122
01:28:12,130 --> 01:28:13,470
We might have met on the plane?

2123
01:28:16,970 --> 01:28:18,510
That was some jump, by the way.

2124
01:28:18,510 --> 01:28:20,350
Oh, me too.

2125
01:28:21,710 --> 01:28:27,490
I was so excited to see the spooky swamp for myself that I didn't realize everyone was behind me.

2126
01:28:27,850 --> 01:28:30,470
Do you know if my Melody and everyone else...

2127
01:28:30,470 --> 01:28:30,990
Yeah, they're okay.

2128
01:28:31,010 --> 01:28:31,430
They're fine.

2129
01:28:31,470 --> 01:28:32,110
Who cares about them?

2130
01:28:32,170 --> 01:28:33,390
It's all about you, girl.

2131
01:28:33,490 --> 01:28:34,590
It's all about you.

2132
01:28:35,210 --> 01:28:36,310
Wow, okay.

2133
01:28:36,430 --> 01:28:39,490
Well, if anyone landed around here, I'll track them down.

2134
01:28:40,730 --> 01:28:41,790
No, don't leave!

2135
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:43,990
Don't leave me, Kuromi!

2136
01:28:45,430 --> 01:28:48,130
Here, I got you a gift.

2137
01:28:48,130 --> 01:28:49,910
It was all me, not my Melody.

2138
01:28:50,070 --> 01:28:50,650
I got you...

2139
01:28:50,650 --> 01:28:50,990
OMG!

2140
01:28:52,130 --> 01:28:55,550
It's the latest book from the Sugar Sweetheart's Forever Se...

2141
01:28:55,550 --> 01:28:56,670
Oh my gosh, she's just like me.

2142
01:28:56,850 --> 01:28:58,750
My Melody knows I'm their big...

2143
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:00,930
No, no, I knew that you're that biggest fan.

2144
01:29:01,230 --> 01:29:01,650
Kuromi.

2145
01:29:02,170 --> 01:29:02,690
Kuromi.

2146
01:29:03,090 --> 01:29:03,610
Kuromi.

2147
01:29:03,930 --> 01:29:04,450
Please.

2148
01:29:04,970 --> 01:29:06,570
Aaka-supa, you Kuromi.

2149
01:29:07,530 --> 01:29:09,450
Say my name, please.

2150
01:29:10,230 --> 01:29:11,290
Kuromi, don't leave.

2151
01:29:11,670 --> 01:29:12,410
I love you.

2152
01:29:15,450 --> 01:29:15,970
Kuromi.

2153
01:29:18,790 --> 01:29:20,030
I was born on Halloween.

2154
01:29:20,170 --> 01:29:21,050
What do you expect?

2155
01:29:21,570 --> 01:29:22,590
Do you need something?

2156
01:29:22,970 --> 01:29:24,070
I have a question.

2157
01:29:24,310 --> 01:29:25,530
I just want to talk to you.

2158
01:29:26,070 --> 01:29:27,510
She's just like me.

2159
01:29:28,350 --> 01:29:29,570
Any tips about gifts?

2160
01:29:29,710 --> 01:29:30,290
What do you like?

2161
01:29:30,490 --> 01:29:31,150
Hello Kitty?

2162
01:29:31,430 --> 01:29:32,350
No, no, no.

2163
01:29:32,430 --> 01:29:33,390
What do you like?

2164
01:29:33,510 --> 01:29:35,170
I don't care about the others.

2165
01:29:35,750 --> 01:29:38,210
I mean, have you ever seen anyone look better on the beach?

2166
01:29:38,510 --> 01:29:39,690
Not the fucking beach.

2167
01:29:40,150 --> 01:29:41,210
Where's Pom Pom Perrin?

2168
01:29:42,470 --> 01:29:42,950
Okay.

2169
01:29:43,190 --> 01:29:44,070
Oh, my God.

2170
01:29:44,130 --> 01:29:46,530
I got to meet my queen, my Oshii.

2171
01:29:47,130 --> 01:29:48,110
Guys, can I get a kiss?

2172
01:29:48,110 --> 01:29:49,590
Guys, I met my Oshii guys.

2173
01:29:51,170 --> 01:29:52,210
Wait, wait!

2174
01:29:53,950 --> 01:29:54,430
Kuromi!

2175
01:29:55,070 --> 01:29:55,550
Kuromi!

2176
01:29:56,150 --> 01:29:56,970
Meet and greet!

2177
01:29:57,650 --> 01:29:58,530
Meet and greet!

2178
01:30:03,350 --> 01:30:04,230
Oh my god!

2179
01:30:04,550 --> 01:30:05,030
Kuromi!

2180
01:30:13,410 --> 01:30:13,890
No!

2181
01:30:15,850 --> 01:30:16,330
Please!

2182
01:30:16,490 --> 01:30:18,210
I paid so much for the...

2183
01:30:18,210 --> 01:30:19,970
Kuromi, please look at the camera!

2184
01:30:20,090 --> 01:30:20,690
I paid so...

2185
01:30:20,690 --> 01:30:21,270
Okay, wait.

2186
01:30:21,450 --> 01:30:23,070
Okay, maybe like I'll set...

2187
01:30:23,070 --> 01:30:23,810
I'll set here!

2188
01:30:24,310 --> 01:30:25,230
I'll set here.

2189
01:30:25,270 --> 01:30:26,490
It's okay, I'll set here.

2190
01:30:26,490 --> 01:30:27,410
So it looks like we're...

2191
01:30:27,890 --> 01:30:28,610
It's okay.

2192
01:30:29,150 --> 01:30:30,290
I'll just stand here.

2193
01:30:33,690 --> 01:30:34,790
I'll just stand here.

2194
01:30:34,910 --> 01:30:35,390
It's okay.

2195
01:30:39,190 --> 01:30:39,890
But yay!

2196
01:30:42,430 --> 01:30:43,210
Wait, what is this?

2197
01:30:43,830 --> 01:30:44,290
Yay!

2198
01:30:44,810 --> 01:30:45,590
Okay, wait, wait.

2199
01:30:46,110 --> 01:30:47,410
No, she has to be normal.

2200
01:30:47,970 --> 01:30:48,710
Okay, wait, wait.

2201
01:30:48,830 --> 01:30:49,030
And...

2202
01:30:49,830 --> 01:30:51,170
Oh, low battery mode.

2203
01:30:51,210 --> 01:30:51,790
That's not good.

2204
01:30:52,150 --> 01:30:52,890
Let me...

2205
01:30:53,870 --> 01:30:54,730
Wait, wait.

2206
01:30:55,030 --> 01:30:56,370
Let me try...

2207
01:30:56,490 --> 01:30:56,950
I just didn't...

2208
01:30:56,950 --> 01:30:57,710
I have...

2209
01:30:57,710 --> 01:30:59,070
I do have a charger.

2210
01:30:59,070 --> 01:30:59,650
Don't worry.

2211
01:30:59,830 --> 01:31:02,110
I didn't realize I was playing for so long, guys.

2212
01:31:02,570 --> 01:31:03,670
I didn't realize.

2213
01:31:03,770 --> 01:31:04,710
I got so absorbed.

2214
01:31:05,030 --> 01:31:06,910
I got so into it.

2215
01:31:07,950 --> 01:31:09,490
I got too into it, guys.

2216
01:31:09,690 --> 01:31:10,350
Give me...

2217
01:31:11,770 --> 01:31:14,390
I do have a charger, so do not worry.

2218
01:31:14,670 --> 01:31:15,910
Guys, do not worry.

2219
01:31:16,190 --> 01:31:18,230
I have it right here.

2220
01:31:21,850 --> 01:31:22,810
I hear you.

2221
01:31:24,090 --> 01:31:25,770
Pull this all the way over here.

2222
01:31:26,870 --> 01:31:27,510
All right.

2223
01:31:28,030 --> 01:31:28,910
Don't worry, guys.

2224
01:31:29,510 --> 01:31:30,650
I need it to be...

2225
01:31:30,650 --> 01:31:32,630
No, why aren't you close to me?

2226
01:31:33,670 --> 01:31:34,110
No!

2227
01:31:34,870 --> 01:31:35,730
Don't worry, guys.

2228
01:31:35,990 --> 01:31:36,850
It'll be fine.

2229
01:31:37,690 --> 01:31:38,570
It'll be fine.

2230
01:31:38,830 --> 01:31:39,650
I just need...

2231
01:31:39,650 --> 01:31:41,890
My cable is a little too short.

2232
01:31:44,150 --> 01:31:47,000
Wait for me.

2233
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:47,900
Can you help me?

2234
01:31:58,390 --> 01:31:59,510
Oh, my God.

2235
01:31:59,610 --> 01:32:01,110
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2236
01:32:01,190 --> 01:32:01,890
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2237
01:32:03,010 --> 01:32:03,830
Oh, my God.

2238
01:32:03,850 --> 01:32:04,430
Am I charging?

2239
01:32:04,650 --> 01:32:05,470
I don't know.

2240
01:32:05,610 --> 01:32:07,890
I have the iPad on my lap now.

2241
01:32:09,990 --> 01:32:10,430
Okay.

2242
01:32:10,930 --> 01:32:11,370
Okay.

2243
01:32:11,490 --> 01:32:11,890
Let's see.

2244
01:32:12,170 --> 01:32:12,870
Oh, my God.

2245
01:32:14,510 --> 01:32:15,390
Oh, yes.

2246
01:32:16,890 --> 01:32:17,330
Yes.

2247
01:32:19,830 --> 01:32:20,730
Oh, my God.

2248
01:32:21,190 --> 01:32:21,990
Oh, my God.

2249
01:32:22,010 --> 01:32:24,530
Guys, guys, I got a photo of my Oshie.

2250
01:32:25,010 --> 01:32:26,130
Oh, my God.

2251
01:32:29,850 --> 01:32:31,790
We got a photo of my Oshie.

2252
01:32:31,890 --> 01:32:32,030
Hey guys!

2253
01:32:32,830 --> 01:32:34,030
I'm so happy!

2254
01:32:35,670 --> 01:32:36,750
I love her.

2255
01:32:36,830 --> 01:32:37,690
I love Kuromi.

2256
01:32:38,190 --> 01:32:39,530
I love Kuromi.

2257
01:32:41,470 --> 01:32:42,470
Oh hey, yeah!

2258
01:32:42,590 --> 01:32:43,090
It's me!

2259
01:32:43,250 --> 01:32:43,670
It's me!

2260
01:32:44,630 --> 01:32:46,870
You're getting the 12.9 inch iPad Pro.

2261
01:32:47,010 --> 01:32:48,250
It's 1.5!

2262
01:32:49,210 --> 01:32:53,470
And before tax, wherever you're seeing money, starting the fun!

2263
01:32:54,010 --> 01:32:55,710
Darkblade, thank you for the super chat.

2264
01:32:55,850 --> 01:32:56,910
Thank you, thank you.

2265
01:32:57,570 --> 01:32:58,050
Alright.

2266
01:32:58,490 --> 01:33:02,590
Yeah, I don't know why it's here, but it clashes with the spooky vibes it's got going.

2267
01:33:02,750 --> 01:33:04,590
Is that a button on the mailbox?

2268
01:33:04,990 --> 01:33:05,630
What does that mean?

2269
01:33:07,490 --> 01:33:08,290
Delivery service.

2270
01:33:11,490 --> 01:33:12,150
Let's see.

2271
01:33:12,590 --> 01:33:13,610
Activate the mailbox.

2272
01:33:15,190 --> 01:33:15,670
Whoa!

2273
01:33:16,530 --> 01:33:17,730
Is this fast travel?

2274
01:33:19,450 --> 01:33:21,210
Kuromi, why are you... what's glowing?

2275
01:33:21,930 --> 01:33:23,330
I never did that before.

2276
01:33:23,530 --> 01:33:25,990
Then again, I never... yeah, I never bought it to touch it.

2277
01:33:26,910 --> 01:33:28,270
I wonder why it's glowing.

2278
01:33:29,690 --> 01:33:31,830
Anyways, you came just in time.

2279
01:33:32,270 --> 01:33:34,790
I was hoping to send over this pumpkin to...

2280
01:33:35,690 --> 01:33:36,730
My melon?

2281
01:33:36,870 --> 01:33:38,110
But I'm right here!

2282
01:33:38,470 --> 01:33:41,890
Kuromi, she'll never appreciate you like I do!

2283
01:33:41,970 --> 01:33:42,410
Kuromi!

2284
01:33:43,330 --> 01:33:43,930
Kuromi!

2285
01:33:46,070 --> 01:33:47,530
I'll deliver the pumpkin!

2286
01:33:47,790 --> 01:33:49,070
You don't do any work.

2287
01:33:49,250 --> 01:33:50,750
Your hands are not meant for work.

2288
01:33:53,710 --> 01:33:55,110
Cherry seed pumpkin.

2289
01:33:55,470 --> 01:33:56,050
Thanks!

2290
01:33:56,050 --> 01:33:57,370
That's a big help!

2291
01:33:58,270 --> 01:33:59,450
It's okay, Kuromi.

2292
01:34:00,890 --> 01:34:02,450
Don't do any work, Kuromi.

2293
01:34:02,810 --> 01:34:04,170
I'll do it for you.

2294
01:34:04,310 --> 01:34:05,110
My queen.

2295
01:34:07,230 --> 01:34:07,790
No!

2296
01:34:07,970 --> 01:34:08,450
No!

2297
01:34:08,910 --> 01:34:10,070
They were girlfriends.

2298
01:34:11,130 --> 01:34:12,110
I refuse!

2299
01:34:12,510 --> 01:34:13,190
I refuse!

2300
01:34:13,490 --> 01:34:14,050
Kuromi!

2301
01:34:16,650 --> 01:34:17,210
Okay.

2302
01:34:17,770 --> 01:34:19,150
An old mailbox.

2303
01:34:19,590 --> 01:34:21,470
Someone must know how to use it.

2304
01:34:21,610 --> 01:34:21,910
I do.

2305
01:34:22,790 --> 01:34:23,070
Wait.

2306
01:34:23,170 --> 01:34:24,550
How do I deliver this?

2307
01:34:24,550 --> 01:34:25,950
Deliver that pumpkin?

2308
01:34:26,270 --> 01:34:28,150
Do you need something?

2309
01:34:28,430 --> 01:34:29,370
I have a question.

2310
01:34:29,710 --> 01:34:30,530
What's up?

2311
01:34:30,610 --> 01:34:31,810
Would you break up with Melody?

2312
01:34:36,770 --> 01:34:38,050
Kuromi, please.

2313
01:34:38,210 --> 01:34:39,810
She doesn't deserve it!

2314
01:34:42,590 --> 01:34:44,890
She doesn't deserve it!

2315
01:34:48,750 --> 01:34:49,390
Guys.

2316
01:34:49,730 --> 01:34:51,590
How do I convince...

2317
01:34:51,590 --> 01:34:54,190
The dachoki just got received.

2318
01:34:54,330 --> 01:34:55,610
Thank you for the super chat.

2319
01:34:55,770 --> 01:34:56,170
Thank you.

2320
01:34:56,170 --> 01:34:56,810
Thank you.

2321
01:34:57,210 --> 01:34:59,110
How do I convince her?

2322
01:34:59,410 --> 01:35:00,510
That she's...

2323
01:35:01,490 --> 01:35:03,670
How do I convince her?

2324
01:35:07,170 --> 01:35:09,310
I need her to like...

2325
01:35:09,310 --> 01:35:10,870
I need her to like...

2326
01:35:10,870 --> 01:35:12,610
Break up with Melody.

2327
01:35:13,690 --> 01:35:15,230
She does not...

2328
01:35:15,230 --> 01:35:18,110
She does... Melody does not deserve her.

2329
01:35:19,610 --> 01:35:21,490
She deserves someone better.

2330
01:35:21,670 --> 01:35:23,510
Like a certain bird person.

2331
01:35:26,610 --> 01:35:28,150
You need to let...

2332
01:35:28,150 --> 01:35:28,290
No!

2333
01:35:29,290 --> 01:35:30,010
No!

2334
01:35:30,110 --> 01:35:32,350
I'd rather her be single!

2335
01:35:37,030 --> 01:35:39,410
She doesn't deserve it!

2336
01:35:39,430 --> 01:35:39,730
No!

2337
01:35:39,870 --> 01:35:41,990
None of them matches my standards!

2338
01:35:43,050 --> 01:35:46,230
None of them match my standards for Kuromi!

2339
01:35:46,230 --> 01:35:48,690
I can't believe it!

2340
01:35:50,490 --> 01:35:51,130
Alright.

2341
01:35:51,130 --> 01:35:51,950
Let's see.

2342
01:35:52,110 --> 01:35:52,870
What do I need?

2343
01:35:53,270 --> 01:35:54,890
I need... Oh, delivery service.

2344
01:35:55,310 --> 01:35:56,850
Give my... I have to walk...

2345
01:35:56,850 --> 01:36:00,030
Discover Sinamoro speedy delivery...

2346
01:36:00,030 --> 01:36:00,710
Sinamoro!

2347
01:36:00,910 --> 01:36:01,790
Where are you?

2348
01:36:04,410 --> 01:36:05,050
Wait!

2349
01:36:06,810 --> 01:36:07,450
Sinamoro?

2350
01:36:08,910 --> 01:36:09,550
Wait.

2351
01:36:09,610 --> 01:36:11,170
How the fuck do I use it though?

2352
01:36:11,550 --> 01:36:12,950
What the fuck?

2353
01:36:13,470 --> 01:36:14,110
Wait.

2354
01:36:14,150 --> 01:36:16,010
The Sinamoro speedy service...

2355
01:36:16,010 --> 01:36:17,470
How do I use it?

2356
01:36:18,330 --> 01:36:19,270
Excuse me?

2357
01:36:21,710 --> 01:36:22,890
Someone must know.

2358
01:36:23,230 --> 01:36:24,410
Who's that someone?

2359
01:36:26,130 --> 01:36:26,690
Who...

2360
01:36:26,690 --> 01:36:28,470
Sorry, Kuromi.

2361
01:36:28,750 --> 01:36:29,270
Oh, hey.

2362
01:36:29,290 --> 01:36:29,730
There's an apple.

2363
01:36:30,050 --> 01:36:31,190
Oh, I can't get there.

2364
01:36:31,410 --> 01:36:32,930
Sorry, Kuromi.

2365
01:36:34,490 --> 01:36:36,070
Sinamoro's... Sinamoro's my first.

2366
01:36:36,310 --> 01:36:36,850
Sorry.

2367
01:36:38,290 --> 01:36:41,230
The moment I find Sinamoro, I don't need you anymore.

2368
01:36:44,290 --> 01:36:45,290
I just...

2369
01:36:45,290 --> 01:36:47,190
I need to find him.

2370
01:36:48,490 --> 01:36:49,530
He's my first.

2371
01:36:49,810 --> 01:36:51,530
He's my first Sanrio love.

2372
01:36:53,650 --> 01:36:54,170
Kuromi.

2373
01:36:55,030 --> 01:36:55,550
Kuromi.

2374
01:36:56,970 --> 01:36:57,490
Hey.

2375
01:36:58,050 --> 01:37:00,550
I can't believe we jumped out of the airplane.

2376
01:37:01,710 --> 01:37:03,570
I'm Kuromi, in case you forget.

2377
01:37:04,730 --> 01:37:06,070
Nice to meet you, Kuromi.

2378
01:37:06,650 --> 01:37:08,230
You know if everyone is okay?

2379
01:37:08,430 --> 01:37:10,290
I didn't see anyone else land with me.

2380
01:37:10,930 --> 01:37:12,430
Um, they landed in the resort.

2381
01:37:13,310 --> 01:37:13,750
Whew.

2382
01:37:14,110 --> 01:37:14,550
Okay.

2383
01:37:14,730 --> 01:37:15,630
That's good to hear.

2384
01:37:16,790 --> 01:37:18,070
Black, thank you for the super chat.

2385
01:37:18,170 --> 01:37:18,710
Thank you, thank you.

2386
01:37:18,750 --> 01:37:21,310
I can't wait to tell Bat-Smarto about that jump.

2387
01:37:23,010 --> 01:37:26,230
And hopefully, get some friends to help fix this place up.

2388
01:37:27,290 --> 01:37:28,830
Where the fuck is... Oh, hey.

2389
01:37:28,870 --> 01:37:29,430
Here's a gift.

2390
01:37:30,110 --> 01:37:31,330
I'm just gonna chuck it at him.

2391
01:37:31,350 --> 01:37:31,670
I don't care.

2392
01:37:34,690 --> 01:37:36,810
Well, a guide to island critters?

2393
01:37:37,590 --> 01:37:39,190
Isn't my Melody great?

2394
01:37:39,450 --> 01:37:40,950
Yeah, she's so great.

2395
01:37:41,710 --> 01:37:45,250
Here, since you came all this way to deliver that gift, let me help you out.

2396
01:37:45,530 --> 01:37:48,270
There are plans to craft flippers which let you swim.

2397
01:37:48,490 --> 01:37:48,850
Oh, wait.

2398
01:37:48,910 --> 01:37:50,230
I actually really need that.

2399
01:37:50,510 --> 01:37:52,530
I've been like, drowning myself.

2400
01:37:53,490 --> 01:37:55,150
Here's what materials you'll need.

2401
01:37:56,570 --> 01:37:57,770
Where's like the crafter?

2402
01:37:58,110 --> 01:38:00,110
Guys, I need to find Tsunomoro.

2403
01:38:01,210 --> 01:38:03,710
Guys, I need to find Tsunomoro so I can take a picture.

2404
01:38:04,870 --> 01:38:06,130
Kuromi, my child.

2405
01:38:07,910 --> 01:38:08,750
Where is it?

2406
01:38:09,510 --> 01:38:10,390
Where's Tsunomoro?

2407
01:38:11,030 --> 01:38:11,430
Tsunomoro.

2408
01:38:13,130 --> 01:38:14,070
Where are you?

2409
01:38:14,210 --> 01:38:16,810
Maybe Tsunomoro will appear when I go back to my Melody.

2410
01:38:17,390 --> 01:38:18,710
Oh my god, I got it.

2411
01:38:19,490 --> 01:38:22,630
He'll show up when I... He'll show up when I see my Melody.

2412
01:38:23,110 --> 01:38:23,830
I believe.

2413
01:38:24,810 --> 01:38:26,430
How the fuck do I get out of here?

2414
01:38:29,910 --> 01:38:30,310
Phew.

2415
01:38:30,570 --> 01:38:30,970
Alright.

2416
01:38:31,530 --> 01:38:32,730
Okay, there's the gate.

2417
01:38:33,750 --> 01:38:34,150
Alright.

2418
01:38:34,690 --> 01:38:35,650
My Melody... Oh, wait.

2419
01:38:35,750 --> 01:38:36,870
I need to craft the flippers.

2420
01:38:36,950 --> 01:38:38,430
I really need the flippers, man.

2421
01:38:38,770 --> 01:38:40,350
Oh, I can just craft it.

2422
01:38:40,390 --> 01:38:40,650
Nice.

2423
01:38:40,950 --> 01:38:43,270
Oh yeah, she's also great.

2424
01:38:43,410 --> 01:38:44,710
Gouki growled.

2425
01:38:44,710 --> 01:38:44,970
Growl.

2426
01:38:45,290 --> 01:38:46,010
Yeah.

2427
01:38:48,170 --> 01:38:49,970
She's so great.

2428
01:38:52,610 --> 01:38:53,330
Yeah.

2429
01:38:59,450 --> 01:39:00,170
First...

2430
01:39:00,170 --> 01:39:02,390
I have mail for you.

2431
01:39:02,830 --> 01:39:04,230
My Melody.

2432
01:39:05,970 --> 01:39:07,910
Melody, I have some mail.

2433
01:39:09,150 --> 01:39:09,870
Please.

2434
01:39:09,870 --> 01:39:10,150
Please.

2435
01:39:10,330 --> 01:39:12,470
Please look at this mail for me.

2436
01:39:12,690 --> 01:39:13,090
Oh, okay.

2437
01:39:13,150 --> 01:39:13,590
Let me...

2438
01:39:14,030 --> 01:39:15,290
Oh, it's because I never...

2439
01:39:15,290 --> 01:39:16,530
Did I never activate this?

2440
01:39:16,610 --> 01:39:17,130
No, I did.

2441
01:39:17,750 --> 01:39:18,930
So, I need to...

2442
01:39:18,930 --> 01:39:19,870
I'll just give it to her here.

2443
01:39:21,350 --> 01:39:23,170
Here's your fucking mail.

2444
01:39:27,010 --> 01:39:27,410
Tsunomoro.

2445
01:39:27,570 --> 01:39:27,970
Tsunomoro.

2446
01:39:28,170 --> 01:39:29,570
Oh my god, he's so cute.

2447
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:32,660
He's helping.

2448
01:39:33,660 --> 01:39:34,360
Look at the...

2449
01:39:34,360 --> 01:39:35,420
Oh my god.

2450
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:36,320
Tsunomoro, no.

2451
01:39:36,440 --> 01:39:36,800
No.

2452
01:39:36,900 --> 01:39:37,220
Okay.

2453
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:37,840
Okay.

2454
01:39:37,880 --> 01:39:38,080
Okay.

2455
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:38,280
Okay.

2456
01:39:38,340 --> 01:39:38,740
Okay.

2457
01:39:38,740 --> 01:39:39,040
Okay.

2458
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:39,220
Okay.

2459
01:39:39,220 --> 01:39:39,500
Okay.

2460
01:39:39,540 --> 01:39:39,940
Look at me.

2461
01:39:40,100 --> 01:39:40,500
Look.

2462
01:39:40,640 --> 01:39:40,780
Yes.

2463
01:39:40,780 --> 01:39:41,300
Look.

2464
01:39:41,620 --> 01:39:42,460
Look at me.

2465
01:39:42,580 --> 01:39:43,700
Oh my god, he's looking at me.

2466
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:44,100
Okay.

2467
01:39:44,720 --> 01:39:45,100
Okay.

2468
01:39:45,540 --> 01:39:45,920
Okay.

2469
01:39:45,980 --> 01:39:45,980
Wait.

2470
01:39:46,120 --> 01:39:46,200
Wait.

2471
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:46,440
Okay.

2472
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:47,180
Wait.

2473
01:39:47,260 --> 01:39:47,920
I need my camera.

2474
01:39:48,080 --> 01:39:49,560
No, I don't want to shop!

2475
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:50,760
I can't take...

2476
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:50,900
Oh.

2477
01:39:50,980 --> 01:39:51,340
Oh.

2478
01:39:51,420 --> 01:39:51,500
Oh.

2479
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:51,600
Oh.

2480
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:52,340
Okay.

2481
01:39:52,580 --> 01:39:52,960
Okay.

2482
01:39:52,980 --> 01:39:53,300
Okay.

2483
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:54,140
Okay.

2484
01:39:54,460 --> 01:39:55,140
It's your time.

2485
01:39:55,500 --> 01:39:55,880
No.

2486
01:39:56,540 --> 01:39:56,920
No.

2487
01:39:58,520 --> 01:39:58,900
No.

2488
01:39:59,780 --> 01:40:00,160
No.

2489
01:40:01,540 --> 01:40:01,920
Okay.

2490
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:03,260
Alright.

2491
01:40:03,260 --> 01:40:03,640
Alright.

2492
01:40:03,740 --> 01:40:04,660
And then...

2493
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:06,240
And then...

2494
01:40:06,770 --> 01:40:06,960
Alright.

2495
01:40:08,360 --> 01:40:09,060
Oh my god.

2496
01:40:09,080 --> 01:40:09,200
Wait.

2497
01:40:09,300 --> 01:40:09,860
No, no, no, no, no.

2498
01:40:09,860 --> 01:40:10,980
Not this one.

2499
01:40:11,340 --> 01:40:12,160
Not this one.

2500
01:40:12,240 --> 01:40:12,400
Wait.

2501
01:40:12,520 --> 01:40:12,880
Cancel.

2502
01:40:13,220 --> 01:40:13,580
Cancel.

2503
01:40:13,620 --> 01:40:14,320
I can't stop.

2504
01:40:14,540 --> 01:40:15,640
I can't stop waving.

2505
01:40:15,680 --> 01:40:15,960
Please.

2506
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:16,680
I'm so embarrassed.

2507
01:40:17,300 --> 01:40:17,920
Tsunomoro, no.

2508
01:40:17,960 --> 01:40:18,580
Look at me.

2509
01:40:18,620 --> 01:40:19,480
I'm so embarrassed.

2510
01:40:19,780 --> 01:40:20,120
No.

2511
01:40:22,380 --> 01:40:23,120
Look at me.

2512
01:40:23,460 --> 01:40:24,160
Look at me.

2513
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:24,680
Yes.

2514
01:40:24,840 --> 01:40:27,060
Look at me as if you admire me, Tsunomoro.

2515
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:27,880
Okay.

2516
01:40:28,460 --> 01:40:28,820
Okay.

2517
01:40:28,860 --> 01:40:30,740
And then I'm gonna look at the camera.

2518
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:31,160
Oh my god.

2519
01:40:31,180 --> 01:40:31,940
He's looking at me, guys.

2520
01:40:32,220 --> 01:40:33,280
Guys, he's looking at me.

2521
01:40:33,300 --> 01:40:34,520
I'm like his biggest fan.

2522
01:40:34,860 --> 01:40:35,640
And then...

2523
01:40:36,180 --> 01:40:36,540
Oh!

2524
01:40:38,540 --> 01:40:38,860
Okay.

2525
01:40:38,900 --> 01:40:39,020
Wait.

2526
01:40:39,100 --> 01:40:39,160
Wait.

2527
01:40:39,220 --> 01:40:39,300
Wait.

2528
01:40:39,300 --> 01:40:40,340
Okay.

2529
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:40,740
Wait, wait, wait.

2530
01:40:40,820 --> 01:40:41,420
Actually...

2531
01:40:42,100 --> 01:40:42,860
Oh my gosh.

2532
01:40:42,920 --> 01:40:43,540
Which one?

2533
01:40:43,980 --> 01:40:45,080
Maybe like...

2534
01:40:45,080 --> 01:40:45,860
Dancing?

2535
01:40:45,940 --> 01:40:46,220
No.

2536
01:40:46,340 --> 01:40:46,640
No.

2537
01:40:46,680 --> 01:40:47,100
Not dancing.

2538
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:48,520
Maybe...

2539
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:50,200
Yes.

2540
01:40:53,110 --> 01:40:53,710
Accept.

2541
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:55,310
Oh my god!

2542
01:40:55,930 --> 01:40:56,530
Ah!

2543
01:40:58,970 --> 01:40:59,570
Look.

2544
01:40:59,830 --> 01:41:00,750
Oh my god.

2545
01:41:00,770 --> 01:41:01,910
I'm your biggest fan.

2546
01:41:02,610 --> 01:41:06,010
I don't care about anybody else, Tsunomoro.

2547
01:41:06,110 --> 01:41:06,770
You're so cute.

2548
01:41:07,110 --> 01:41:08,670
Look at his cute outfit.

2549
01:41:10,370 --> 01:41:11,710
Sometimes when there's a cute outfit, I'm like, oh my god.

2550
01:41:20,430 --> 01:41:39,070
I give him a 15.

2551
01:41:39,990 --> 01:41:41,710
One-minute, don't look.

2552
01:41:41,710 --> 01:41:42,250
Are you looking for me?

2553
01:41:42,250 --> 01:41:42,590
Yes!

2554
01:41:44,570 --> 01:41:46,130
Yes, I have a question.

2555
01:41:46,810 --> 01:41:47,690
How can I help?

2556
01:41:47,770 --> 01:41:48,910
Any tips about yes?

2557
01:41:48,970 --> 01:41:49,750
What do you like?

2558
01:41:50,010 --> 01:41:51,730
I don't care about her!

2559
01:41:52,070 --> 01:41:53,990
I don't care about Melody!

2560
01:41:57,130 --> 01:42:00,510
Dear Daniel, bro, I don't care about Daniel either!

2561
01:42:01,130 --> 01:42:03,390
Can I get a vibe check?

2562
01:42:05,710 --> 01:42:12,610
You haven't discovered enough of the island to determine your island vibe score just yet.

2563
01:42:12,610 --> 01:42:14,010
Oh my god!

2564
01:42:14,890 --> 01:42:15,410
What?

2565
01:42:17,250 --> 01:42:18,970
There's a vibe check?

2566
01:42:19,490 --> 01:42:21,830
I guess you can get your present.

2567
01:42:22,070 --> 01:42:22,850
I don't fucking guess.

2568
01:42:23,490 --> 01:42:24,010
So...

2569
01:42:25,770 --> 01:42:26,970
A what check?

2570
01:42:27,070 --> 01:42:27,950
A vibe check?

2571
01:42:28,370 --> 01:42:30,270
Give me one second, I'll be right with you.

2572
01:42:32,110 --> 01:42:33,230
Just sign here.

2573
01:42:33,430 --> 01:42:36,470
Oh my god, he's like the Amazon delivery guy in this game.

2574
01:42:36,850 --> 01:42:37,290
Here you go!

2575
01:42:37,450 --> 01:42:38,390
Thanks, Cinemoro!

2576
01:42:39,730 --> 01:42:40,850
Oh, do you know Cinemoro?

2577
01:42:40,850 --> 01:42:41,850
Yes, I do!

2578
01:42:42,050 --> 01:42:42,590
I'm your best friend!

2579
01:42:42,610 --> 01:42:43,290
I'm your biggest fan!

2580
01:42:43,830 --> 01:42:47,830
I'm your number one donator on your YouTube channel!

2581
01:42:49,750 --> 01:42:53,670
Lollipop, a nice picture of Cinemoro and a dragon.

2582
01:42:53,930 --> 01:42:55,390
Thank you for the super chat.

2583
01:42:55,530 --> 01:42:56,370
Thank you, thank you.

2584
01:42:56,510 --> 01:42:57,250
Hey there!

2585
01:42:58,370 --> 01:42:59,010
Please!

2586
01:42:59,190 --> 01:43:00,850
I'm your number one donator!

2587
01:43:01,670 --> 01:43:03,810
Thanks again for delivering the pumpkin.

2588
01:43:04,130 --> 01:43:06,910
I've been a 10 year membership!

2589
01:43:07,250 --> 01:43:10,030
I have a 10 year membership to your channel Cinemoro!

2590
01:43:10,030 --> 01:43:11,710
I'm in your fan club!

2591
01:43:12,710 --> 01:43:15,870
It's hard to get spooky things at the Seat Side Resort.

2592
01:43:17,310 --> 01:43:21,870
Can you do me a favor and deliver this coastal aquatic plant to Kuromi in the...

2593
01:43:21,870 --> 01:43:22,130
Okay.

2594
01:43:22,250 --> 01:43:25,730
It's something that would be hard to get out of the spooky swamp.

2595
01:43:26,050 --> 01:43:27,830
Guess I gotta bring this back.

2596
01:43:29,450 --> 01:43:31,430
I'll tell her I got her that plant.

2597
01:43:35,070 --> 01:43:37,230
I don't want to impose, but I can...

2598
01:43:37,230 --> 01:43:37,490
Oh!

2599
01:43:37,730 --> 01:43:38,230
Yes!

2600
01:43:39,070 --> 01:43:40,010
Yes please!

2601
01:43:40,390 --> 01:43:41,010
Yes please!

2602
01:43:41,350 --> 01:43:41,970
Follow me!

2603
01:43:42,310 --> 01:43:44,130
Of course I'll follow you everywhere!

2604
01:43:44,930 --> 01:43:45,650
Let's go!

2605
01:43:46,130 --> 01:43:47,170
Let's follow...

2606
01:43:47,170 --> 01:43:49,490
Let's follow our first...

2607
01:43:49,490 --> 01:43:51,250
Our first gen real love.

2608
01:43:52,230 --> 01:43:53,470
Hello Cinemoro.

2609
01:43:54,110 --> 01:43:55,650
What do you want to tell me?

2610
01:43:57,330 --> 01:43:58,510
Hey, when did...

2611
01:43:58,510 --> 01:44:00,590
I've seen one of these in the spooky swamps.

2612
01:44:01,250 --> 01:44:02,210
That's fantastic!

2613
01:44:02,570 --> 01:44:04,010
You've already come across a fast...

2614
01:44:04,010 --> 01:44:05,010
Oh it is fast travel!

2615
01:44:05,070 --> 01:44:05,610
I knew it!

2616
01:44:06,110 --> 01:44:07,210
Throughout your journey, you've already come across a fast...

2617
01:44:07,230 --> 01:44:09,090
You will come across these mailboxes.

2618
01:44:10,510 --> 01:44:13,290
Upon activating the fast travel mailbox...

2619
01:44:13,290 --> 01:44:15,950
You'll have the ability to be delivered back to this spot...

2620
01:44:15,950 --> 01:44:16,790
at Cinemoro speeds.

2621
01:44:17,370 --> 01:44:18,110
Oh cool!

2622
01:44:18,550 --> 01:44:20,410
No more walking back for me!

2623
01:44:20,750 --> 01:44:22,570
Now please activate this mailbox.

2624
01:44:22,850 --> 01:44:23,630
Did I not activate it?

2625
01:44:24,790 --> 01:44:25,350
Yeah!

2626
01:44:29,480 --> 01:44:31,680
You know that mailbox was found...

2627
01:44:31,680 --> 01:44:33,640
You found in the spooky swamp?

2628
01:44:34,040 --> 01:44:37,080
Since you already activated it, you can return there at any time.

2629
01:44:37,540 --> 01:44:40,020
Just select your map and select the icon...

2630
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:41,740
Then select a destination.

2631
01:44:42,080 --> 01:44:44,900
In this case, please choose the spooky swamps.

2632
01:44:45,120 --> 01:44:45,520
No!

2633
01:44:48,380 --> 01:44:49,240
Where did he go?

2634
01:44:49,300 --> 01:44:51,320
I was going to take a picture with you!

2635
01:44:56,060 --> 01:44:56,800
Oh my god!

2636
01:44:56,840 --> 01:44:58,340
Oh I can take a picture with all of them!

2637
01:44:58,700 --> 01:44:59,100
Okay.

2638
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:01,380
Okay I gotta take a picture of all of them.

2639
01:45:01,860 --> 01:45:03,100
With all my Oshis.

2640
01:45:03,260 --> 01:45:03,900
All of you guys.

2641
01:45:04,480 --> 01:45:05,220
Look back.

2642
01:45:05,400 --> 01:45:06,220
Oh my god!

2643
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:06,900
Yes!

2644
01:45:10,620 --> 01:45:11,020
Okay.

2645
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:11,680
Okay.

2646
01:45:11,980 --> 01:45:13,560
Okay and then I wanna...

2647
01:45:14,360 --> 01:45:15,820
I'm gonna do...

2648
01:45:16,340 --> 01:45:18,340
And then get the fuck away from there bug!

2649
01:45:18,720 --> 01:45:20,440
And then I'm gonna be like...

2650
01:45:20,440 --> 01:45:20,860
Yeah!

2651
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:26,580
Which one?

2652
01:45:26,700 --> 01:45:27,060
Oh my god!

2653
01:45:27,080 --> 01:45:27,740
Me and my Oshis!

2654
01:45:27,960 --> 01:45:29,120
Me and my Oshis guys!

2655
01:45:29,320 --> 01:45:31,400
I paid a lot of money for this meet and greet!

2656
01:45:31,560 --> 01:45:32,400
With my Kamiyoshi!

2657
01:45:32,620 --> 01:45:33,820
A fucking course at Cinemoro!

2658
01:45:34,440 --> 01:45:36,440
Cinemoro and then Kuromi is my second!

2659
01:45:36,680 --> 01:45:37,500
You're my second!

2660
01:45:37,820 --> 01:45:38,980
Oshi don't worry!

2661
01:45:39,960 --> 01:45:40,400
Mmm...

2662
01:45:42,120 --> 01:45:43,120
I'm not creepy!

2663
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:44,040
I'm not creepy!

2664
01:45:44,040 --> 01:45:44,040
I swear!

2665
01:45:49,480 --> 01:45:51,000
She's my second one.

2666
01:45:51,140 --> 01:45:52,580
And then Kutama is the third.

2667
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:54,260
Kutama it's like...

2668
01:45:54,260 --> 01:45:55,500
And then it's like...

2669
01:45:56,200 --> 01:45:58,880
Cinemoro, Kuromi, Kutama...

2670
01:45:58,880 --> 01:45:59,700
And...

2671
01:46:00,520 --> 01:46:01,120
and...

2672
01:46:02,200 --> 01:46:02,500
Pompompurin.

2673
01:46:04,820 --> 01:46:06,260
No problem in here.

2674
01:46:06,500 --> 01:46:07,700
I'm not gonna mention Melody.

2675
01:46:07,900 --> 01:46:09,020
Oh it's so cute!

2676
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:11,600
Friendship ended with Kuromi.

2677
01:46:11,720 --> 01:46:13,280
Now, Cinemara is my best friend.

2678
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:14,080
Doki probably.

2679
01:46:14,660 --> 01:46:17,000
Hidden thank you for the super chat.

2680
01:46:17,180 --> 01:46:18,100
Thank you, thank you.

2681
01:46:18,180 --> 01:46:19,420
I mean, whatever.

2682
01:46:19,660 --> 01:46:21,020
Oh my god, she's just like me.

2683
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,340
Guys, I know like... okay, look.

2684
01:46:26,860 --> 01:46:29,820
Look, I love... I love Kuromi, but like...

2685
01:46:29,820 --> 01:46:33,380
You never forget your first and Cinemara was my first.

2686
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:39,920
You... you never forget your first.

2687
01:46:40,780 --> 01:46:42,220
So how do you like the...

2688
01:46:42,680 --> 01:46:44,540
That was amazing, Cinemara!

2689
01:46:45,360 --> 01:46:46,420
Oh, it's my pleasure.

2690
01:46:47,800 --> 01:46:52,280
When you're out there on your adventures, just make sure to keep an eye out for any more mobs.

2691
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:52,640
Of course.

2692
01:46:52,700 --> 01:46:53,860
Do you wanna live here?

2693
01:46:54,440 --> 01:46:55,880
Do you wanna...

2694
01:46:56,440 --> 01:46:58,440
Do you wanna live... Friendship!

2695
01:46:58,740 --> 01:47:01,360
Oh my god, Cinemara, I got you some gifts.

2696
01:47:01,720 --> 01:47:02,560
What do you like?

2697
01:47:03,240 --> 01:47:04,400
You like bonus.

2698
01:47:04,500 --> 01:47:05,700
You like those puffs.

2699
01:47:05,720 --> 01:47:07,220
And then you like...

2700
01:47:07,220 --> 01:47:09,700
Coffee, chocolate, and salt.

2701
01:47:09,700 --> 01:47:11,360
Okay, guys.

2702
01:47:11,660 --> 01:47:13,560
Maybe he'll like live here now.

2703
01:47:14,580 --> 01:47:15,440
Where is it?

2704
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:18,220
Who the fuck are they?

2705
01:47:18,340 --> 01:47:19,640
Oh my god, oh my god.

2706
01:47:19,700 --> 01:47:21,520
There's like his girlfriend and then there's...

2707
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:22,480
Oh, there's Baku!

2708
01:47:23,860 --> 01:47:25,920
There's Baku and then there's...

2709
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:26,820
Alright.

2710
01:47:27,240 --> 01:47:30,820
We should like not... we should... we should not get his girlfriend on the island.

2711
01:47:31,220 --> 01:47:31,680
We should...

2712
01:47:31,680 --> 01:47:35,000
Which one was it?

2713
01:47:35,060 --> 01:47:36,480
This is his girlfriend, Moka.

2714
01:47:38,020 --> 01:47:39,520
Um... the leader of the...

2715
01:47:40,820 --> 01:47:43,060
Moka is like an older sibling to the group.

2716
01:47:43,120 --> 01:47:45,100
Sometimes bossy, but often sweet.

2717
01:47:45,340 --> 01:47:47,800
She also likes to show off the flowers in her...

2718
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:50,480
We're not getting his... his girlfriend's not gonna be in...

2719
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:51,780
Uh... in this...

2720
01:47:52,540 --> 01:47:54,060
On this island.

2721
01:47:54,260 --> 01:47:55,100
Wait, that's the sister?

2722
01:47:55,420 --> 01:47:56,920
Who the fuck is the girlfriend?

2723
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:00,380
That's the sister?

2724
01:48:01,140 --> 01:48:03,040
I thought that was the girlfriend!

2725
01:48:04,020 --> 01:48:04,980
Oh shit.

2726
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:07,760
Guys, this is how little I care about his girlfriend.

2727
01:48:08,120 --> 01:48:08,640
I...

2728
01:48:09,700 --> 01:48:10,500
Was it Chiffon?

2729
01:48:10,900 --> 01:48:12,700
It has to be Chiffon, right?

2730
01:48:13,180 --> 01:48:15,200
Cause this is like cappuccino.

2731
01:48:16,040 --> 01:48:17,160
That's cappuccino.

2732
01:48:17,200 --> 01:48:18,080
Or was it espresso?

2733
01:48:18,520 --> 01:48:20,800
Is either espresso or...

2734
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:21,560
No, he does!

2735
01:48:21,820 --> 01:48:23,160
He has a girlfriend!

2736
01:48:23,960 --> 01:48:25,500
This is... this is like...

2737
01:48:26,220 --> 01:48:26,920
There's literally...

2738
01:48:26,920 --> 01:48:29,660
You cannot say that...

2739
01:48:29,660 --> 01:48:31,680
You cannot say this is a kids game.

2740
01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:34,100
When fucking dear Daniel is in this game.

2741
01:48:34,200 --> 01:48:36,940
And they've been like pushing Daniel at me so hard.

2742
01:48:37,120 --> 01:48:37,660
Like...

2743
01:48:39,700 --> 01:48:40,460
Literally says...

2744
01:48:40,460 --> 01:48:42,340
Boyfriend to Hello Kitty.

2745
01:48:42,520 --> 01:48:43,580
No, he does!

2746
01:48:44,420 --> 01:48:45,960
He does have a girlfriend!

2747
01:48:46,360 --> 01:48:47,320
It's true!

2748
01:48:48,100 --> 01:48:49,380
Is it Chiffon or...

2749
01:48:49,380 --> 01:48:50,140
Espresso?

2750
01:48:50,420 --> 01:48:52,500
This is how little I care about his girlfriend.

2751
01:48:56,360 --> 01:48:57,480
Oh, Chiffon.

2752
01:48:57,700 --> 01:48:58,420
Fucker.

2753
01:49:02,600 --> 01:49:04,460
You don't deserve him.

2754
01:49:04,700 --> 01:49:06,020
You don't deserve him!

2755
01:49:09,700 --> 01:49:12,380
He's the peppiest member of the Cinema Angels.

2756
01:49:12,780 --> 01:49:15,020
She is an avid sports fan.

2757
01:49:15,180 --> 01:49:17,440
And is always eager for a lively game.

2758
01:49:17,620 --> 01:49:18,940
You don't deserve him.

2759
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:26,000
He had a girlfriend.

2760
01:49:26,140 --> 01:49:26,820
You're right, guys.

2761
01:49:27,060 --> 01:49:28,500
He had a girlfriend.

2762
01:49:28,820 --> 01:49:31,320
We're never letting his family live on our island, guys.

2763
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:32,440
Never.

2764
01:49:32,680 --> 01:49:33,600
Who's this guy?

2765
01:49:33,780 --> 01:49:34,720
Part of...

2766
01:49:34,720 --> 01:49:36,000
Is this guy new?

2767
01:49:36,100 --> 01:49:37,040
I've never seen this guy before.

2768
01:49:37,880 --> 01:49:39,420
R301, welcome to the tournament!

2769
01:49:39,420 --> 01:49:39,780
Holy shit.

2770
01:49:39,780 --> 01:49:42,680
They made it up for me when I'm parasocial.

2771
01:49:46,860 --> 01:49:47,520
Look.

2772
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:49,960
Look, I'm not gonna say...

2773
01:49:54,580 --> 01:49:58,480
I'm not gonna say that, but like they deserve so much better.

2774
01:50:02,680 --> 01:50:05,640
They deserve more than what they can give them.

2775
01:50:05,960 --> 01:50:08,520
I know somebody that can give them what they want.

2776
01:50:14,360 --> 01:50:15,620
Oh my god.

2777
01:50:15,740 --> 01:50:17,460
Are you gonna live here now, Tsunamaru?

2778
01:50:17,900 --> 01:50:20,260
Are you gonna live in my village?

2779
01:50:22,440 --> 01:50:23,420
Oh my god.

2780
01:50:23,500 --> 01:50:24,620
I can't believe it.

2781
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:26,880
Tsunamaru is gonna live in my town.

2782
01:50:27,200 --> 01:50:28,140
Oh my god.

2783
01:50:28,460 --> 01:50:29,940
What are my other missions?

2784
01:50:30,040 --> 01:50:33,620
I've not cared about my other quest ever since I found Tsunamaru.

2785
01:50:38,520 --> 01:50:38,920
Friendship.

2786
01:50:38,920 --> 01:50:40,400
Okay, Kuromi, what do you want?

2787
01:50:40,520 --> 01:50:40,960
Kuromi.

2788
01:50:41,980 --> 01:50:43,020
Kuromi, what do you want?

2789
01:50:43,120 --> 01:50:44,720
I'll be level 4 friends with you.

2790
01:50:48,840 --> 01:50:49,280
Kuromi.

2791
01:50:50,540 --> 01:50:51,480
Do you want pumpkin?

2792
01:50:51,700 --> 01:50:51,960
Here.

2793
01:50:52,040 --> 01:50:52,680
Here's a pumpkin.

2794
01:50:53,560 --> 01:50:54,360
Oh, you are?

2795
01:50:54,780 --> 01:50:55,460
Here you go.

2796
01:50:57,840 --> 01:50:58,940
Oh, a light stone.

2797
01:50:59,240 --> 01:51:02,000
Okay, that's not pumpkin, but... Level 2!

2798
01:51:04,700 --> 01:51:05,620
Oh my god.

2799
01:51:05,680 --> 01:51:07,840
I have the Kuromi Avatar Palette.

2800
01:51:07,900 --> 01:51:08,340
Wait.

2801
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:09,560
What does Tsunamaru want?

2802
01:51:09,820 --> 01:51:10,460
Tsunamaru!

2803
01:51:11,720 --> 01:51:12,360
Tsunamaru!

2804
01:51:12,420 --> 01:51:13,700
So I can be my Oshis colors.

2805
01:51:14,540 --> 01:51:15,180
Tsunamaru!

2806
01:51:15,240 --> 01:51:15,700
Tsunamaru!

2807
01:51:16,460 --> 01:51:17,560
Tsunamaru is gone!

2808
01:51:18,340 --> 01:51:18,840
No!

2809
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:20,380
You left away!

2810
01:51:21,800 --> 01:51:22,120
No!

2811
01:51:22,700 --> 01:51:23,520
It's okay.

2812
01:51:23,600 --> 01:51:25,760
I can be number 2 Oshi colors.

2813
01:51:26,260 --> 01:51:27,820
How do I change my colors?

2814
01:51:28,180 --> 01:51:30,220
How do I change my colors?

2815
01:51:30,720 --> 01:51:32,700
They never taught me how to...

2816
01:51:32,700 --> 01:51:33,320
No!

2817
01:51:34,760 --> 01:51:36,280
My Oshi!

2818
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:40,360
Do you want a pumpkin?

2819
01:51:40,360 --> 01:51:41,420
I have a pumpkin.

2820
01:51:42,520 --> 01:51:43,520
Here you go.

2821
01:51:43,860 --> 01:51:45,280
You ran away.

2822
01:51:46,140 --> 01:51:47,180
It's over.

2823
01:51:47,840 --> 01:51:49,160
Do you want another gift?

2824
01:51:49,280 --> 01:51:50,300
I have another one.

2825
01:51:51,220 --> 01:51:52,920
Here, take all my pumpkins.

2826
01:51:53,420 --> 01:51:55,440
And take all of it.

2827
01:51:56,540 --> 01:51:57,280
Friendship grows!

2828
01:51:57,880 --> 01:51:59,020
I'm level 3!

2829
01:52:01,820 --> 01:52:03,200
I'm level 3 now.

2830
01:52:03,560 --> 01:52:04,700
Do you want another gift?

2831
01:52:04,780 --> 01:52:05,860
Oh... wait.

2832
01:52:06,120 --> 01:52:07,880
Can I give 3 gifts a day?

2833
01:52:07,980 --> 01:52:08,260
No!

2834
01:52:09,060 --> 01:52:10,980
I can't love bump.

2835
01:52:11,220 --> 01:52:11,660
Kuromi!

2836
01:52:12,680 --> 01:52:13,580
Kuromi, please!

2837
01:52:14,040 --> 01:52:17,020
I know you set a limit on Super Chats.

2838
01:52:17,680 --> 01:52:20,080
Kuromi, I used up my Super Chat limit.

2839
01:52:20,260 --> 01:52:20,760
Kuromi!

2840
01:52:21,240 --> 01:52:25,020
I'm gonna make a new account so I can give you more Super Chats.

2841
01:52:25,020 --> 01:52:25,420
Kuromi!

2842
01:52:28,180 --> 01:52:30,200
It's so good over.

2843
01:52:31,060 --> 01:52:34,740
Kuromi, please take my... please... please take my pumpkin.

2844
01:52:35,300 --> 01:52:37,320
Please, I show you my pumpkin.

2845
01:52:37,720 --> 01:52:38,280
Please.

2846
01:52:39,640 --> 01:52:40,720
Kuromi, please.

2847
01:52:41,620 --> 01:52:42,760
Kuromi, please.

2848
01:52:45,040 --> 01:52:46,980
I'll make a new account.

2849
01:52:47,180 --> 01:52:48,880
Kuromi, please take my pumpkin.

2850
01:52:50,860 --> 01:52:51,460
No!

2851
01:52:52,040 --> 01:52:52,640
Kuromi!

2852
01:52:53,520 --> 01:52:54,120
Kuromi!

2853
01:52:56,240 --> 01:52:56,540
Please.

2854
01:52:57,680 --> 01:52:59,940
I'm such... I love Kuromi!

2855
01:53:00,660 --> 01:53:02,800
Darklight, thank you for the Super Chat.

2856
01:53:02,920 --> 01:53:03,280
Thank you.

2857
01:53:03,320 --> 01:53:03,920
Thank you.

2858
01:53:04,320 --> 01:53:05,280
Kuromi, no!

2859
01:53:06,380 --> 01:53:07,900
Don't turn me off!

2860
01:53:08,960 --> 01:53:11,320
I'm here to give you my support.

2861
01:53:13,180 --> 01:53:14,940
I don't understand.

2862
01:53:19,100 --> 01:53:20,220
Was that ghost?

2863
01:53:20,340 --> 01:53:21,780
Why is there a fucking ghost?

2864
01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:23,600
Who are you?

2865
01:53:24,180 --> 01:53:25,400
Choose a hat?

2866
01:53:26,540 --> 01:53:28,780
It's like... new hat.

2867
01:53:29,480 --> 01:53:31,600
I meet the eye... Oh my god.

2868
01:53:31,720 --> 01:53:33,820
They're all like hat ghosts or something.

2869
01:53:34,040 --> 01:53:35,440
Who the fuck are these people?

2870
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:38,360
Okay.

2871
01:53:38,400 --> 01:53:38,500
Okay.

2872
01:53:38,500 --> 01:53:40,160
Okay, the order is like...

2873
01:53:40,160 --> 01:53:40,640
It's...

2874
01:53:40,640 --> 01:53:45,520
It's Sinamoro, Kuromi, Kotama, Pampa, Peren, and then Retsuko.

2875
01:53:46,440 --> 01:53:47,580
Retsuko is the...

2876
01:53:47,580 --> 01:53:49,080
Retsuko is the other one.

2877
01:53:49,520 --> 01:53:50,440
It's on the...

2878
01:53:50,440 --> 01:53:51,240
Where are the hats?

2879
01:53:51,560 --> 01:53:53,140
I don't wanna fucking exchange hats.

2880
01:53:54,140 --> 01:53:55,720
Oh yeah, I can swim now too.

2881
01:53:55,840 --> 01:53:56,420
Where's Retsuko?

2882
01:53:57,100 --> 01:53:58,820
We gotta find Retsuko.

2883
01:54:00,220 --> 01:54:01,160
Where is she?

2884
01:54:01,240 --> 01:54:02,600
The ghost tour gallop?

2885
01:54:03,320 --> 01:54:05,120
Oh, I don't care about that enough.

2886
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:06,840
We gotta find Retsuko.

2887
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:07,140
Retsuko.

2888
01:54:07,800 --> 01:54:10,460
Kuromi is about to follow his training.

2889
01:54:12,960 --> 01:54:13,400
Waiter.

2890
01:54:13,580 --> 01:54:14,920
Ivy, thank you for the super chat.

2891
01:54:14,980 --> 01:54:15,260
Thank you.

2892
01:54:15,280 --> 01:54:15,760
Thank you.

2893
01:54:15,780 --> 01:54:17,180
I'm so tired.

2894
01:54:17,360 --> 01:54:17,820
It's Sinamoro.

2895
01:54:17,880 --> 01:54:18,040
Yeah!

2896
01:54:18,260 --> 01:54:19,140
Yeah, he was!

2897
01:54:19,420 --> 01:54:21,600
I took a photo with him earlier.

2898
01:54:22,140 --> 01:54:22,820
Go brain.

2899
01:54:24,020 --> 01:54:24,900
Go brain.

2900
01:54:25,020 --> 01:54:25,680
Thank you for the super chat.

2901
01:54:25,800 --> 01:54:26,020
Thank you.

2902
01:54:26,040 --> 01:54:26,500
Thank you.

2903
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:27,640
I took a photo!

2904
01:54:27,860 --> 01:54:29,380
I took a photo with him!

2905
01:54:29,640 --> 01:54:30,420
With my Oshi.

2906
01:54:30,700 --> 01:54:31,760
With my Kami Oshi.

2907
01:54:33,060 --> 01:54:33,880
Guys, I'm lost.

2908
01:54:34,500 --> 01:54:35,340
Where am I?

2909
01:54:35,340 --> 01:54:37,620
I'm actually lost.

2910
01:54:38,840 --> 01:54:40,120
What the fuck?

2911
01:54:40,180 --> 01:54:41,220
Oh, that's just a rock.

2912
01:54:41,320 --> 01:54:42,340
I was like, what happened?

2913
01:54:42,580 --> 01:54:45,060
I got fucking eaten by the rock.

2914
01:54:46,700 --> 01:54:52,360
Guys, I'm so out of place that the map stopped loading on my top left corner.

2915
01:54:52,720 --> 01:54:55,780
The map is just gone on the top left corner, guys.

2916
01:54:59,860 --> 01:55:01,940
That's how lost I am.

2917
01:55:02,280 --> 01:55:03,980
There's no more maps anymore.

2918
01:55:03,980 --> 01:55:06,080
Where am I?

2919
01:55:06,460 --> 01:55:08,150
I'm in the gemstone mountain?

2920
01:55:08,860 --> 01:55:10,680
How do I get out of here?

2921
01:55:12,500 --> 01:55:14,660
The map is just white.

2922
01:55:15,500 --> 01:55:17,640
There's like no areas anymore.

2923
01:55:19,520 --> 01:55:20,540
Oh my gosh.

2924
01:55:20,600 --> 01:55:21,120
Oh, there we go.

2925
01:55:21,580 --> 01:55:22,740
Okay, we're safe.

2926
01:55:23,080 --> 01:55:24,100
We're safe now.

2927
01:55:24,720 --> 01:55:26,220
Okay, the dune lagoon.

2928
01:55:26,300 --> 01:55:26,920
Okay, we were here.

2929
01:55:27,620 --> 01:55:28,420
We were here.

2930
01:55:28,500 --> 01:55:29,700
This is where we found...

2931
01:55:29,700 --> 01:55:31,040
This was a spooky forest.

2932
01:55:31,400 --> 01:55:32,780
Oh, there's fast travel.

2933
01:55:32,920 --> 01:55:33,520
Fast travel.

2934
01:55:34,640 --> 01:55:35,200
Yeah!

2935
01:55:37,860 --> 01:55:38,940
Where am I?

2936
01:55:39,080 --> 01:55:41,060
I'm having a ghost tour ride now.

2937
01:55:41,680 --> 01:55:42,240
Okay.

2938
01:55:42,980 --> 01:55:44,380
We need to find...

2939
01:55:44,380 --> 01:55:46,040
We need to find Pom Pom Purin.

2940
01:55:46,860 --> 01:55:48,340
He's like somewhere here.

2941
01:55:50,840 --> 01:55:52,660
We found the spooky swamps.

2942
01:55:53,340 --> 01:55:53,900
But...

2943
01:55:54,840 --> 01:55:56,280
We can't find...

2944
01:55:56,280 --> 01:55:57,080
Where's Pom Pom Purin?

2945
01:55:58,360 --> 01:55:59,480
Pom Pom Purin!

2946
01:56:00,280 --> 01:56:00,840
Okay.

2947
01:56:01,120 --> 01:56:02,700
There's a castle over here.

2948
01:56:02,900 --> 01:56:03,500
Maybe Pom Pom Purin is over there.

2949
01:56:03,500 --> 01:56:03,820
imiz

2950
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:24,080
Good morning!

2951
01:56:25,580 --> 01:56:25,880
Darling!

2952
01:56:25,880 --> 01:56:29,900
Good morning.

2953
01:56:30,840 --> 01:56:31,480
Well,

2954
01:56:43,280 --> 01:56:44,000
it's a little dark so we're not going to sleep here.

2955
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:44,040
It's a little red.

2956
01:56:44,040 --> 01:56:44,480
We're going to sleep here, right?

2957
01:56:44,480 --> 01:56:44,800
We're in a house.

2958
01:56:44,800 --> 01:56:45,120
We're in an apartment.

2959
01:56:45,120 --> 01:56:47,380
He's not... he doesn't even show up in the maps!

2960
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:49,160
He's just gone!

2961
01:56:52,160 --> 01:56:54,640
I just wanna farm pom-pom pudding!

2962
01:56:55,980 --> 01:56:57,240
Oh wait, I got stuck.

2963
01:56:59,400 --> 01:57:00,780
I missed the Kutama.

2964
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:01,180
No!

2965
01:57:01,400 --> 01:57:02,740
And I missed the Kutama!

2966
01:57:03,740 --> 01:57:05,380
Oh my god, I'm a mess.

2967
01:57:06,180 --> 01:57:08,100
I'm a fucking mess right now.

2968
01:57:08,420 --> 01:57:10,840
Oh, you can't just cheese the maze.

2969
01:57:10,980 --> 01:57:12,840
You actually have to do the maze.

2970
01:57:13,120 --> 01:57:14,320
I thought I could climb it.

2971
01:57:14,320 --> 01:57:16,140
He's off the grid!

2972
01:57:17,280 --> 01:57:18,740
He should be here!

2973
01:57:19,100 --> 01:57:20,940
He landed on this side!

2974
01:57:21,680 --> 01:57:22,640
Oh my god, hat!

2975
01:57:23,700 --> 01:57:25,080
There's a hat on one of them.

2976
01:57:25,600 --> 01:57:27,020
Wait, I'm gonna steal his hat.

2977
01:57:28,060 --> 01:57:29,720
Wait, is this like a game?

2978
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:31,860
It is, right?

2979
01:57:32,820 --> 01:57:36,220
One game ticket for one- grab as many ghost apples.

2980
01:57:39,040 --> 01:57:40,600
You're gonna blow my nose, Ginse.

2981
01:57:45,150 --> 01:57:46,190
Oh my god!

2982
01:57:46,930 --> 01:57:48,170
How many game tickets do I have?

2983
01:57:48,450 --> 01:57:49,210
I can do this.

2984
01:57:49,650 --> 01:57:50,730
That can't be difficult.

2985
01:57:51,070 --> 01:57:51,950
Plus two apples.

2986
01:57:52,790 --> 01:57:53,230
Grab.

2987
01:57:54,370 --> 01:57:55,130
Grab, grab.

2988
01:57:55,590 --> 01:57:56,730
Do I have to come back to him?

2989
01:57:57,510 --> 01:57:57,950
Grab.

2990
01:57:59,390 --> 01:57:59,990
Don't worry.

2991
01:58:00,170 --> 01:58:00,950
Look at the speedrun.

2992
01:58:02,510 --> 01:58:03,950
Look at this fucking speedrun.

2993
01:58:04,250 --> 01:58:07,150
Wait, there's a power crystal here?

2994
01:58:07,810 --> 01:58:09,430
Wait, there's a power crystal here.

2995
01:58:09,690 --> 01:58:10,270
Oh, chest.

2996
01:58:10,630 --> 01:58:11,910
Oh, I can't open the chest.

2997
01:58:11,970 --> 01:58:13,030
I have to keep grabbing apples.

2998
01:58:13,410 --> 01:58:14,170
Oh no.

2999
01:58:15,750 --> 01:58:16,730
Wait, 16?

3000
01:58:17,890 --> 01:58:18,650
Oh no.

3001
01:58:18,790 --> 01:58:19,930
Don't worry, I'm not lost.

3002
01:58:20,350 --> 01:58:21,690
I'm just gonna spam.

3003
01:58:22,930 --> 01:58:23,410
Grab.

3004
01:58:23,950 --> 01:58:24,970
Is that chopsticks?

3005
01:58:25,250 --> 01:58:25,690
What is that?

3006
01:58:26,290 --> 01:58:27,290
The fuck is that?

3007
01:58:27,510 --> 01:58:28,190
Oh, it's Gautama!

3008
01:58:28,810 --> 01:58:29,290
Yes.

3009
01:58:29,950 --> 01:58:31,090
Oh my god, it's Gautama.

3010
01:58:32,110 --> 01:58:33,450
Oh, I can't take a photo.

3011
01:58:33,570 --> 01:58:33,730
No!

3012
01:58:36,710 --> 01:58:42,790
I Gautama- I tried to take a Gautama break and the game was like, Doki, please.

3013
01:58:42,790 --> 01:58:45,770
There is another game you have to play.

3014
01:58:46,130 --> 01:58:47,310
I was like, but Gautama.

3015
01:58:48,390 --> 01:58:49,150
Gautama- No!

3016
01:58:49,310 --> 01:58:54,890
The Gautama fucking- Great job.

3017
01:58:54,890 --> 01:58:55,550
Here is a prize.

3018
01:58:55,730 --> 01:58:57,130
I still got a prize though.

3019
01:58:57,510 --> 01:58:59,190
I got blue brain hat.

3020
01:58:59,410 --> 01:59:00,190
Oh, I got a hat.

3021
01:59:00,550 --> 01:59:01,910
And I got five apples.

3022
01:59:02,250 --> 01:59:03,210
Wait, I wanna wear this hat.

3023
01:59:03,570 --> 01:59:04,750
How do I wear this hat?

3024
01:59:06,090 --> 01:59:06,810
Hat time.

3025
01:59:08,390 --> 01:59:09,370
How do I wear it?

3026
01:59:09,470 --> 01:59:09,990
Is this?

3027
01:59:11,270 --> 01:59:11,750
Where?

3028
01:59:11,750 --> 01:59:12,630
What's it look like?

3029
01:59:12,790 --> 01:59:14,410
Oh my god!

3030
01:59:17,290 --> 01:59:19,370
Oh my god!

3031
01:59:19,510 --> 01:59:20,930
What the fuck?

3032
01:59:24,330 --> 01:59:25,910
Oh my god!

3033
01:59:26,290 --> 01:59:27,090
Okay.

3034
01:59:27,470 --> 01:59:28,830
It's a little freaky.

3035
01:59:29,470 --> 01:59:32,290
It's a little freaky.

3036
01:59:32,770 --> 01:59:34,270
We'll make it work.

3037
01:59:34,350 --> 01:59:35,310
We can make this work.

3038
01:59:35,730 --> 01:59:37,570
Mojo Jojo?

3039
01:59:44,030 --> 01:59:45,270
Jagun Gun Gun.

3040
01:59:46,350 --> 01:59:49,070
Guys, we can make it work, guys.

3041
01:59:49,510 --> 01:59:50,810
Can I like look at this?

3042
01:59:51,290 --> 01:59:52,690
Where's Pom Pom Pudding?

3043
01:59:53,390 --> 01:59:55,250
Oh, there's another world here?

3044
01:59:57,290 --> 01:59:57,810
Wait.

3045
01:59:57,810 --> 01:59:58,810
Oh my god.

3046
01:59:58,870 --> 01:59:59,550
What the fuck?

3047
01:59:59,590 --> 02:00:01,050
Wait, there is another world here.

3048
02:00:03,510 --> 02:00:04,490
Where is he?

3049
02:00:05,490 --> 02:00:06,310
Oh my god!

3050
02:00:06,350 --> 02:00:06,910
Where'd you go?

3051
02:00:07,090 --> 02:00:11,150
I like how Pom Pom Pudding is like, where is he?

3052
02:00:11,590 --> 02:00:12,770
He's over there.

3053
02:00:12,770 --> 02:00:13,230
There?

3054
02:00:13,510 --> 02:00:15,390
How do I get there?

3055
02:00:16,790 --> 02:00:17,970
Wait, what?

3056
02:00:19,530 --> 02:00:23,570
He has his own store that's like 200 miles away.

3057
02:00:24,450 --> 02:00:25,410
Holy shit.

3058
02:00:25,530 --> 02:00:29,630
Guys, the main plaza is like here, guys.

3059
02:00:29,830 --> 02:00:32,170
Why are you all so far away?

3060
02:00:32,630 --> 02:00:34,730
They're lost in the fog.

3061
02:00:35,090 --> 02:00:40,790
Okay, now that I know where he is, I'm gonna go back to the resort plaza.

3062
02:00:41,270 --> 02:00:41,950
Okay.

3063
02:00:41,950 --> 02:00:43,370
We're gonna meet Ritsuko first.

3064
02:00:43,990 --> 02:00:47,150
It's bigger than the Tears of Kingdom map.

3065
02:00:47,270 --> 02:00:49,570
I still don't know how to change my appearance.

3066
02:00:49,890 --> 02:00:51,490
I wanna be my Oshis colors.

3067
02:00:51,990 --> 02:00:54,970
But like, I don't know how to change my colors.

3068
02:00:56,790 --> 02:00:57,270
Okay.

3069
02:00:58,070 --> 02:00:59,390
I have a nice hat now.

3070
02:00:59,550 --> 02:01:01,150
This is a cute hat, not gonna lie.

3071
02:01:01,810 --> 02:01:04,950
This is me as an introvert.

3072
02:01:07,510 --> 02:01:08,890
Let's pick this up.

3073
02:01:09,010 --> 02:01:10,630
I'm gonna pick this up though, real fast.

3074
02:01:10,630 --> 02:01:11,530
Yeah!

3075
02:01:11,730 --> 02:01:13,190
Alright, we're gonna swim to Ritsuko.

3076
02:01:13,610 --> 02:01:14,750
Ritsuko, don't worry.

3077
02:01:15,050 --> 02:01:17,550
Oshi number five, I'm coming over.

3078
02:01:18,770 --> 02:01:20,030
Don't worry, Ritsuko.

3079
02:01:20,790 --> 02:01:23,270
You might have heard about me from the others.

3080
02:01:23,650 --> 02:01:24,870
Wait, am I going the right way?

3081
02:01:26,390 --> 02:01:28,170
There's an island here for food?

3082
02:01:28,310 --> 02:01:29,070
What is that?

3083
02:01:29,250 --> 02:01:31,850
Do you guys see that island on the map?

3084
02:01:32,870 --> 02:01:33,490
Don't worry.

3085
02:01:33,990 --> 02:01:35,850
I'm gonna swim over.

3086
02:01:36,630 --> 02:01:39,710
I'm gonna swim over to you, Ritsuko.

3087
02:01:39,710 --> 02:01:40,070
Ritsuko!

3088
02:01:43,210 --> 02:01:44,330
Oh, that's cute.

3089
02:01:44,430 --> 02:01:45,250
An exposed brain.

3090
02:01:45,430 --> 02:01:45,990
I know, right?

3091
02:01:46,730 --> 02:01:48,370
Don't worry, Ritsuko.

3092
02:01:49,230 --> 02:01:51,050
Saving private Ritsuko.

3093
02:01:51,270 --> 02:01:53,690
But there's a store right here, I think.

3094
02:01:54,330 --> 02:01:56,890
On my map, it shows like some fucking store.

3095
02:01:57,010 --> 02:01:57,330
Oh, wait.

3096
02:01:57,390 --> 02:01:57,630
Nice.

3097
02:01:57,630 --> 02:01:58,150
Fast travel.

3098
02:01:58,230 --> 02:01:58,890
We actually need that.

3099
02:02:01,290 --> 02:02:01,770
Yay!

3100
02:02:03,310 --> 02:02:05,050
Anything for my Oshis.

3101
02:02:06,090 --> 02:02:06,570
Ritsuko!

3102
02:02:08,470 --> 02:02:09,630
I need a boat!

3103
02:02:09,650 --> 02:02:09,690
Ritsuko!

3104
02:02:09,690 --> 02:02:12,560
I need a boat!

3105
02:02:12,720 --> 02:02:13,260
Whoa, what's this?

3106
02:02:13,460 --> 02:02:13,920
Oh, nothing.

3107
02:02:14,080 --> 02:02:14,500
I was just...

3108
02:02:14,500 --> 02:02:15,040
Sorry.

3109
02:02:15,340 --> 02:02:16,620
Sorry, I got a little distracted.

3110
02:02:17,600 --> 02:02:18,080
Ritsuko!

3111
02:02:20,480 --> 02:02:21,260
I'm coming!

3112
02:02:22,600 --> 02:02:23,540
I'll do it.

3113
02:02:23,560 --> 02:02:26,780
I'll travel around the world for a boat with my Oshis!

3114
02:02:28,160 --> 02:02:29,860
I love you, Ritsuko!

3115
02:02:30,840 --> 02:02:32,240
Oh, hey, there's a house here too.

3116
02:02:32,980 --> 02:02:33,560
Oh, wait.

3117
02:02:33,600 --> 02:02:34,680
There's a...

3118
02:02:34,680 --> 02:02:35,440
Do you have a hat?

3119
02:02:36,960 --> 02:02:38,080
We can swap hats?

3120
02:02:38,360 --> 02:02:40,320
Oh, you don't have no hats to exchange.

3121
02:02:41,040 --> 02:02:41,520
God.

3122
02:02:41,540 --> 02:02:42,220
Damn it.

3123
02:02:42,240 --> 02:02:43,340
He has no hats for me.

3124
02:02:44,520 --> 02:02:46,240
I got a die patch?

3125
02:02:46,480 --> 02:02:47,420
Where did I get that?

3126
02:02:47,860 --> 02:02:49,020
Like, what?

3127
02:02:50,120 --> 02:02:50,600
Okay.

3128
02:02:50,960 --> 02:02:51,440
Where...

3129
02:02:51,440 --> 02:02:52,240
Where is she?

3130
02:02:52,420 --> 02:02:53,420
Oh, she's over there.

3131
02:02:54,880 --> 02:02:55,360
Ritsuko!

3132
02:02:56,440 --> 02:02:58,140
I'm gonna climb up this wall!

3133
02:02:59,440 --> 02:03:02,700
It looks like I can't climb up this wall just to see her.

3134
02:03:03,020 --> 02:03:03,540
Let's go!

3135
02:03:03,820 --> 02:03:04,840
Climb up this...

3136
02:03:04,840 --> 02:03:06,980
Oh, I got soft locked into that wall.

3137
02:03:09,160 --> 02:03:10,700
How do I get to you?

3138
02:03:11,040 --> 02:03:11,520
Oh, I'm so scared.

3139
02:03:13,680 --> 02:03:14,280
Ritsuko!

3140
02:03:20,090 --> 02:03:21,750
I don't understand!

3141
02:03:22,610 --> 02:03:24,990
It won't let me climb this mountain!

3142
02:03:27,690 --> 02:03:30,450
To, like, convince them of my love!

3143
02:03:31,350 --> 02:03:32,450
I'm gonna climb.

3144
02:03:32,870 --> 02:03:34,310
Oh, I figured it out.

3145
02:03:34,670 --> 02:03:36,170
I figured it out.

3146
02:03:36,330 --> 02:03:37,270
Oh, my God.

3147
02:03:37,310 --> 02:03:37,910
Here I come.

3148
02:03:38,470 --> 02:03:39,930
Ritsuko, I'm coming over.

3149
02:03:41,050 --> 02:03:41,910
Don't worry.

3150
02:03:42,650 --> 02:03:43,250
I'm coming.

3151
02:03:43,690 --> 02:03:44,090
Oh, my God.

3152
02:03:44,090 --> 02:03:45,030
My other Oshii!

3153
02:03:46,550 --> 02:03:48,950
This is how dedicated I am to the cause.

3154
02:03:51,710 --> 02:03:52,310
Oh God.

3155
02:03:52,410 --> 02:03:52,590
Okay.

3156
02:03:54,530 --> 02:03:54,930
Ritsuko!

3157
02:03:56,410 --> 02:03:57,010
Oh, wait.

3158
02:03:57,070 --> 02:03:57,910
What's this flower?

3159
02:03:58,250 --> 02:03:58,850
Oh, my God.

3160
02:03:58,870 --> 02:03:59,770
Maybe she'll like that.

3161
02:03:59,990 --> 02:04:00,390
Maybe...

3162
02:04:00,390 --> 02:04:01,130
Hello?

3163
02:04:03,390 --> 02:04:03,790
Ritsuko?

3164
02:04:03,990 --> 02:04:04,770
Is someone there?

3165
02:04:06,650 --> 02:04:08,110
Yeah, I'm over here in the bushes.

3166
02:04:08,590 --> 02:04:09,710
Would you be able to help me?

3167
02:04:09,770 --> 02:04:10,390
Oh, my God.

3168
02:04:10,550 --> 02:04:13,250
Of course I can, so you'll owe me forever, Ritsuko!

3169
02:04:13,270 --> 02:04:14,390
Remember my name!

3170
02:04:14,430 --> 02:04:15,190
I'm Doki Bird!

3171
02:04:17,450 --> 02:04:18,010
Hello!

3172
02:04:19,230 --> 02:04:20,810
Thanks for helping me out there!

3173
02:04:21,430 --> 02:04:22,130
Oh my gosh!

3174
02:04:22,310 --> 02:04:22,810
Of course!

3175
02:04:23,170 --> 02:04:25,590
I jumped out of Tsunamaru's plane!

3176
02:04:25,730 --> 02:04:27,510
This was Tsunamaru's plane?

3177
02:04:28,150 --> 02:04:29,010
Oh my...

3178
02:04:30,750 --> 02:04:33,770
Tsunamaru, I love you man, but don't ever drive a plane again.

3179
02:04:35,890 --> 02:04:38,390
Now you owe me forever, Retsuko!

3180
02:04:39,990 --> 02:04:42,290
And this debt can never be repaid.

3181
02:04:42,290 --> 02:04:44,590
I landed in the bushes and got stuck.

3182
02:04:45,170 --> 02:04:46,610
Oh, where are my manners?

3183
02:04:47,330 --> 02:04:48,170
I'm Retsuko!

3184
02:04:48,370 --> 02:04:49,690
Oh my god, nice to meet you!

3185
02:04:50,810 --> 02:04:51,550
Oh no!

3186
02:04:51,710 --> 02:04:52,390
My luggage!

3187
02:04:53,250 --> 02:04:53,730
No!

3188
02:04:53,730 --> 02:04:54,890
Don't cry, baby!

3189
02:04:56,190 --> 02:04:58,570
I must have floated off course as well!

3190
02:05:00,630 --> 02:05:02,750
I'm gonna stay here and look for my belongings.

3191
02:05:03,090 --> 02:05:05,370
If only I had friends... I'll be your friend!

3192
02:05:05,550 --> 02:05:08,590
One mini-credits ticket for Pom Pom Pudding, please!

3193
02:05:08,950 --> 02:05:11,510
Thank you for the super chat, Zecra!

3194
02:05:11,610 --> 02:05:12,070
Thank you!

3195
02:05:12,290 --> 02:05:12,710
Thank you!

3196
02:05:12,770 --> 02:05:13,910
Oh my god!

3197
02:05:14,350 --> 02:05:14,870
Retsuko!

3198
02:05:16,130 --> 02:05:16,650
Retsuko!

3199
02:05:17,630 --> 02:05:19,110
Okay, okay, alright.

3200
02:05:19,370 --> 02:05:20,230
You, you...

3201
02:05:20,230 --> 02:05:21,250
Yeah?

3202
02:05:21,870 --> 02:05:22,390
Nice.

3203
02:05:22,490 --> 02:05:23,390
Okay, I'm gonna move you.

3204
02:05:23,690 --> 02:05:24,750
Alright, here you go.

3205
02:05:24,870 --> 02:05:25,950
We're gonna take a picture, okay?

3206
02:05:26,570 --> 02:05:27,550
You and me.

3207
02:05:27,690 --> 02:05:28,870
Yes, you look like that.

3208
02:05:29,030 --> 02:05:32,230
And then I want Retsuko... I want you to...

3209
02:05:32,230 --> 02:05:35,270
I want you to make...

3210
02:05:36,750 --> 02:05:39,510
Make this expression for me, alright, Retsuko?

3211
02:05:39,790 --> 02:05:41,510
I want you to make this expression.

3212
02:05:41,510 --> 02:05:43,970
And then I... I will make...

3213
02:05:44,450 --> 02:05:46,430
I will make this expression.

3214
02:05:46,730 --> 02:05:47,090
Hahaha.

3215
02:05:47,730 --> 02:05:48,850
Or like... No, no, no.

3216
02:05:49,170 --> 02:05:50,030
No, actually, no.

3217
02:05:50,930 --> 02:05:51,830
What do I do?

3218
02:05:52,810 --> 02:05:53,910
No, oh, wait, no!

3219
02:05:53,970 --> 02:05:55,370
That should be your expression, yes!

3220
02:05:55,570 --> 02:05:57,330
And then I'd be like...

3221
02:05:57,330 --> 02:06:00,070
I'd be like... Wait, I need like a good word.

3222
02:06:03,980 --> 02:06:04,420
Yes!

3223
02:06:04,420 --> 02:06:04,860
Yes!

3224
02:06:09,420 --> 02:06:12,680
I'll be like, you owe your life to me now, Retsuko!

3225
02:06:12,680 --> 02:06:13,280
Hahaha.

3226
02:06:15,420 --> 02:06:16,580
Retsuko, my friend.

3227
02:06:18,220 --> 02:06:19,940
You're on vacation, Retsuko.

3228
02:06:20,940 --> 02:06:22,100
Can I help you?

3229
02:06:22,460 --> 02:06:23,880
I'll let you relax.

3230
02:06:24,700 --> 02:06:25,320
Girl.

3231
02:06:25,740 --> 02:06:28,420
So here's a gift that I found just for you.

3232
02:06:28,860 --> 02:06:31,880
Bro, Melody didn't give her a gift!

3233
02:06:32,740 --> 02:06:35,040
Melody never made her a gift!

3234
02:06:35,140 --> 02:06:39,260
That's so fu- Don't worry.

3235
02:06:39,900 --> 02:06:41,520
I'll be your friend!

3236
02:06:42,560 --> 02:06:44,120
Who cares about her?

3237
02:06:46,020 --> 02:06:47,480
Oh my god!

3238
02:06:50,500 --> 02:06:52,580
She didn't give her anything!

3239
02:06:53,240 --> 02:06:55,180
Don't worry, here's another Cinnabloom.

3240
02:06:55,360 --> 02:06:56,400
I got you, girl.

3241
02:06:57,200 --> 02:06:58,240
I got you.

3242
02:06:59,020 --> 02:07:00,080
You're so kind.

3243
02:07:00,240 --> 02:07:02,040
I'll be your only friend, Retsuko.

3244
02:07:02,580 --> 02:07:04,040
Be your only friend.

3245
02:07:04,440 --> 02:07:06,860
You don't need the other people on the island.

3246
02:07:06,980 --> 02:07:07,980
You just need me.

3247
02:07:08,480 --> 02:07:10,160
Nice, I received another dough.

3248
02:07:10,420 --> 02:07:10,980
Yeah!

3249
02:07:11,040 --> 02:07:11,500
I'm like, I'm like...

3250
02:07:11,500 --> 02:07:11,980
Level 2!

3251
02:07:12,780 --> 02:07:15,260
I got the Retsuko Avatar Palette.

3252
02:07:15,800 --> 02:07:16,380
Nice.

3253
02:07:17,100 --> 02:07:18,420
Okay, now we gotta...

3254
02:07:18,420 --> 02:07:20,200
Now we gotta find Pom Pom Puddin.

3255
02:07:20,740 --> 02:07:22,420
Alright, where's Pom Pom Puddin?

3256
02:07:22,600 --> 02:07:24,080
Pom Pom Puddin is like right here.

3257
02:07:24,240 --> 02:07:24,860
Don't worry.

3258
02:07:25,700 --> 02:07:27,220
Travel across the world.

3259
02:07:27,280 --> 02:07:28,200
Your parents still...

3260
02:07:28,200 --> 02:07:29,400
That's a joke.

3261
02:07:30,200 --> 02:07:30,780
Look!

3262
02:07:32,420 --> 02:07:35,160
Look, Melody never made her a gift!

3263
02:07:35,340 --> 02:07:36,920
That's so fucked up!

3264
02:07:37,220 --> 02:07:41,040
Just because Retsuko is newer is the newest...

3265
02:07:41,040 --> 02:07:43,580
Okay, she's not even a new addition too.

3266
02:07:43,720 --> 02:07:45,660
She's not even a new addition!

3267
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:50,480
And Melody never even made her a fucking gift in the first place!

3268
02:07:52,320 --> 02:07:53,580
Can't believe it!

3269
02:07:53,640 --> 02:07:56,600
She deserves better and I'm the better one.

3270
02:07:57,440 --> 02:07:58,440
I'm the better.

3271
02:07:58,840 --> 02:08:00,320
Okay, I got Red Power Crystal.

3272
02:08:00,440 --> 02:08:01,060
What the fuck?

3273
02:08:02,640 --> 02:08:04,260
Oh, there's the fast travel.

3274
02:08:05,040 --> 02:08:06,940
Let's grab that fast travel real fast.

3275
02:08:08,920 --> 02:08:09,860
Alright, nice.

3276
02:08:11,040 --> 02:08:12,260
We're almost there to Pom Pom Puddin.

3277
02:08:12,500 --> 02:08:13,180
I think?

3278
02:08:13,260 --> 02:08:13,800
Where is he?

3279
02:08:13,940 --> 02:08:15,100
Yeah, he's like to our right.

3280
02:08:15,340 --> 02:08:15,820
Look!

3281
02:08:15,920 --> 02:08:17,980
She made a gift for Pom Pom Puddin!

3282
02:08:18,200 --> 02:08:18,900
Oh no.

3283
02:08:19,520 --> 02:08:20,280
Oh no.

3284
02:08:20,320 --> 02:08:20,900
Thank God.

3285
02:08:20,960 --> 02:08:24,660
I love how whenever the game knows I'm stuck, like it helps me out.

3286
02:08:24,820 --> 02:08:25,680
Pom Pom Puddin!

3287
02:08:27,440 --> 02:08:28,160
Don't worry!

3288
02:08:29,060 --> 02:08:30,080
I'll save you!

3289
02:08:30,120 --> 02:08:30,780
I'll be a hero!

3290
02:08:31,540 --> 02:08:33,000
I'll be a hero!

3291
02:08:34,780 --> 02:08:35,260
No!

3292
02:08:35,560 --> 02:08:36,360
Let me...

3293
02:08:36,360 --> 02:08:37,120
Okay.

3294
02:08:38,200 --> 02:08:39,280
Okay, we gotta...

3295
02:08:39,280 --> 02:08:40,220
How do we get there?

3296
02:08:40,540 --> 02:08:41,020
Okay.

3297
02:08:41,020 --> 02:08:41,820
Wait, how do we...

3298
02:08:41,820 --> 02:08:43,480
How do we get to that side?

3299
02:08:44,980 --> 02:08:45,540
No.

3300
02:08:46,440 --> 02:08:47,000
No!

3301
02:08:48,620 --> 02:08:52,860
This island won't fucking forbid me from seeing my other Oshis.

3302
02:08:53,020 --> 02:08:55,120
I will meet all my Oshis!

3303
02:08:56,400 --> 02:08:57,800
What the fuck is this?

3304
02:08:58,320 --> 02:08:59,240
What is this?

3305
02:09:01,240 --> 02:09:02,200
What's this side?

3306
02:09:02,860 --> 02:09:03,780
What the fuck?

3307
02:09:07,240 --> 02:09:07,800
Mysterious...

3308
02:09:07,800 --> 02:09:07,820
Oh!

3309
02:09:07,820 --> 02:09:11,220
Alright, I guess I'll never be able to read that.

3310
02:09:11,460 --> 02:09:12,520
Oh my God.

3311
02:09:13,240 --> 02:09:16,980
Mountains are fucking denying me of meeting my other Oshi.

3312
02:09:19,160 --> 02:09:20,720
That's so fucked up.

3313
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:22,080
Let's grab...

3314
02:09:22,700 --> 02:09:23,640
Wait, 20...

3315
02:09:23,640 --> 02:09:23,820
What?

3316
02:09:23,960 --> 02:09:25,520
I'm literally charging it.

3317
02:09:29,240 --> 02:09:30,320
What do you mean?

3318
02:09:30,800 --> 02:09:32,740
Oh, it's because like...

3319
02:09:32,740 --> 02:09:33,840
Okay, don't worry guys.

3320
02:09:34,240 --> 02:09:36,480
Although I know it says like 20...

3321
02:09:36,480 --> 02:09:37,700
Wait, I can climb this.

3322
02:09:37,700 --> 02:09:39,800
I'll fucking brute force this.

3323
02:09:40,300 --> 02:09:41,600
I'll brute force this.

3324
02:09:42,620 --> 02:09:44,000
Come on, let me climb this.

3325
02:09:44,660 --> 02:09:45,220
No.

3326
02:09:45,660 --> 02:09:46,940
No, it's too far.

3327
02:09:47,660 --> 02:09:49,340
It's too far away.

3328
02:09:50,260 --> 02:09:50,820
No!

3329
02:09:53,500 --> 02:09:58,420
Please, let me meet my other Oshi before I lose all the batteries!

3330
02:09:59,140 --> 02:10:00,660
I don't know how!

3331
02:10:01,080 --> 02:10:01,880
I'm stuck.

3332
02:10:05,720 --> 02:10:06,280
No!

3333
02:10:07,700 --> 02:10:10,140
I'm trying to figure out how to get to him!

3334
02:10:12,160 --> 02:10:14,440
I'm literally walking around the mountain.

3335
02:10:14,660 --> 02:10:14,760
Oh!

3336
02:10:15,400 --> 02:10:15,840
Yes!

3337
02:10:17,680 --> 02:10:18,120
Yes!

3338
02:10:20,720 --> 02:10:21,160
Okay.

3339
02:10:21,620 --> 02:10:23,480
I'm on a time limit now, guys.

3340
02:10:23,660 --> 02:10:24,020
Whoop.

3341
02:10:24,200 --> 02:10:25,220
Is it gonna kick me up?

3342
02:10:25,260 --> 02:10:25,740
Oh, thank God.

3343
02:10:25,820 --> 02:10:26,020
Okay.

3344
02:10:26,180 --> 02:10:27,600
Alright, we figure out how to get up.

3345
02:10:28,280 --> 02:10:29,860
Oh no, I'm stuck again.

3346
02:10:30,040 --> 02:10:30,720
Oh my God.

3347
02:10:30,740 --> 02:10:31,660
I unlocked the map.

3348
02:10:31,800 --> 02:10:32,240
Let's go.

3349
02:10:32,960 --> 02:10:34,220
Let's fucking go.

3350
02:10:36,360 --> 02:10:37,680
We don't end until the end.

3351
02:10:37,680 --> 02:10:39,180
Until we meet our other Oshi!

3352
02:10:39,680 --> 02:10:40,440
Okay, wait, wait.

3353
02:10:40,560 --> 02:10:41,440
I'm gonna recharge stamina.

3354
02:10:41,780 --> 02:10:42,660
I figured it out.

3355
02:10:43,100 --> 02:10:44,300
Recharge the stamina right here.

3356
02:10:45,080 --> 02:10:45,520
Okay.

3357
02:10:46,420 --> 02:10:47,260
We're gonna do this.

3358
02:10:48,420 --> 02:10:48,980
That's right.

3359
02:10:49,100 --> 02:10:49,460
Yes!

3360
02:10:53,440 --> 02:10:57,920
The things I do for the people I love.

3361
02:10:58,560 --> 02:10:59,320
This is it.

3362
02:10:59,860 --> 02:11:00,640
This is it.

3363
02:11:01,160 --> 02:11:03,140
Oh my God, I see him on the map, guys.

3364
02:11:03,640 --> 02:11:04,600
Let me meet him.

3365
02:11:05,240 --> 02:11:06,340
This has to be him.

3366
02:11:06,400 --> 02:11:07,500
This has to be where you live!

3367
02:11:07,560 --> 02:11:07,660
Oh my God.

3368
02:11:07,660 --> 02:11:08,720
I'm floating down.

3369
02:11:08,720 --> 02:11:09,420
Pump, pump, put in!

3370
02:11:10,420 --> 02:11:11,660
I'm floating down!

3371
02:11:12,720 --> 02:11:13,280
I'm floating down!

3372
02:11:13,280 --> 02:11:15,220
Don't keep doing the sequence breaks.

3373
02:11:15,820 --> 02:11:16,380
Oh!

3374
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,060
He runs an ice cream store!

3375
02:11:19,760 --> 02:11:21,120
We've been looking for you.

3376
02:11:21,440 --> 02:11:23,140
I had plenty of time for a nap.

3377
02:11:24,540 --> 02:11:27,000
I'm pump, pump, put in, by the way.

3378
02:11:27,300 --> 02:11:30,060
You never go in front of me and my Oshis.

3379
02:11:30,100 --> 02:11:31,540
I'll always find a way.

3380
02:11:31,740 --> 02:11:32,240
I think I saw you in my dreams during my...

3381
02:11:32,240 --> 02:11:34,860
I think I saw you in my dreams during my...

3382
02:11:34,860 --> 02:11:35,320
No!

3383
02:11:40,600 --> 02:11:43,000
Maybe this is a sign I should go back to sleep.

3384
02:11:44,400 --> 02:11:48,060
This non-functional ice cream boat is a great nap spot.

3385
02:11:48,860 --> 02:11:50,660
But I do wish I had a clothe...

3386
02:11:51,260 --> 02:11:52,100
Let's become friends!

3387
02:11:52,780 --> 02:11:53,960
Let's become friends then!

3388
02:11:54,740 --> 02:11:56,340
Friendship and naps, the best thing...

3389
02:11:56,340 --> 02:11:57,100
Oh my god!

3390
02:11:57,160 --> 02:11:58,680
I'm Pum Pum Puddin's friend!

3391
02:11:59,660 --> 02:12:00,620
I'm in!

3392
02:12:01,400 --> 02:12:02,520
I'm actually in!

3393
02:12:03,520 --> 02:12:04,340
Here you go.

3394
02:12:05,300 --> 02:12:06,060
I'm in!

3395
02:12:06,540 --> 02:12:09,660
Of course Melody knew I'd need a tasty snack after the plane.

3396
02:12:09,860 --> 02:12:11,720
She's so thoughtful, isn't she?

3397
02:12:12,740 --> 02:12:13,720
She's so me.

3398
02:12:14,580 --> 02:12:15,620
Oh my god.

3399
02:12:15,940 --> 02:12:17,760
You mean I'm so thoughtful.

3400
02:12:17,860 --> 02:12:18,700
Oh my god, he gave me a banana.

3401
02:12:20,760 --> 02:12:21,420
Friendship rose!

3402
02:12:22,560 --> 02:12:24,320
I'm now friends with Pum Pum Puddin!

3403
02:12:24,600 --> 02:12:25,800
Alright, we gotta take a picture.

3404
02:12:26,340 --> 02:12:27,000
We gotta take a picture.

3405
02:12:27,520 --> 02:12:28,760
We gotta take a picture.

3406
02:12:28,820 --> 02:12:29,400
Look at the...

3407
02:12:29,400 --> 02:12:30,600
Look at the camera!

3408
02:12:31,240 --> 02:12:31,840
Yes!

3409
02:12:32,100 --> 02:12:34,340
And then I'm gonna be like...

3410
02:12:34,960 --> 02:12:35,560
Yay!

3411
02:12:35,700 --> 02:12:36,560
Or maybe like...

3412
02:12:38,220 --> 02:12:38,700
Ah!

3413
02:12:40,480 --> 02:12:41,800
Not a stalker.

3414
02:12:45,060 --> 02:12:47,380
Not a stalker by the way.

3415
02:12:48,580 --> 02:12:49,680
We did it.

3416
02:12:50,060 --> 02:12:52,540
We found all our Oshis guys!

3417
02:12:52,840 --> 02:12:54,760
We fucking did it!

3418
02:12:55,120 --> 02:12:55,720
Yay!

3419
02:12:56,380 --> 02:12:59,000
I wonder like who else can we have for visitors.

3420
02:12:59,940 --> 02:13:00,980
We suggest...

3421
02:13:00,980 --> 02:13:03,240
Oh there's like Pum Pum Puddin's mom and dad.

3422
02:13:03,600 --> 02:13:04,540
And like sister?

3423
02:13:05,440 --> 02:13:06,140
Wait, Pum...

3424
02:13:06,140 --> 02:13:09,840
Makaron is a golden retriever who styles herself to look like a poodle.

3425
02:13:10,040 --> 02:13:11,080
She wears an...

3426
02:13:11,080 --> 02:13:12,800
Oh my gosh, I didn't know about Makaron.

3427
02:13:13,440 --> 02:13:14,640
I didn't know about Makaron.

3428
02:13:14,880 --> 02:13:16,420
Okay, that's so sad.

3429
02:13:16,680 --> 02:13:18,920
But Retsuko has like no visitors.

3430
02:13:19,700 --> 02:13:20,720
Like that's...

3431
02:13:20,720 --> 02:13:22,080
That's like...

3432
02:13:22,080 --> 02:13:22,940
I don't know.

3433
02:13:23,080 --> 02:13:24,600
It's a little fucking sad.

3434
02:13:28,800 --> 02:13:29,380
Like...

3435
02:13:29,380 --> 02:13:30,240
Like...

3436
02:13:30,240 --> 02:13:30,260
Like...

3437
02:13:30,260 --> 02:13:32,830
Like everybody has like a visitor except for...

3438
02:13:33,700 --> 02:13:36,280
Except for like Retsuko.

3439
02:13:36,980 --> 02:13:37,280
Except for like Retsuko.

3440
02:13:37,300 --> 02:13:38,740
Is that like the girlfriend?

3441
02:13:39,260 --> 02:13:39,840
Is that like the girlfriend?

3442
02:13:41,920 --> 02:13:45,300
Must be in Gemstone Mountain to be near Pum Pum Puddin.

3443
02:13:45,440 --> 02:13:46,040
Is this the same?

3444
02:13:46,380 --> 02:13:48,100
Wait, is that the girlfriend?

3445
02:13:48,880 --> 02:13:50,760
Does Pum Pum Puddin have a girlfriend?

3446
02:13:52,280 --> 02:13:53,900
Does Pum Pum Puddin have a girlfriend?

3447
02:13:53,900 --> 02:13:56,380
He had a girlfriend.

3448
02:13:57,060 --> 02:13:59,240
He had a girlfriend.

3449
02:14:02,940 --> 02:14:04,220
Not anymore.

3450
02:14:05,720 --> 02:14:08,360
I'll be your only neighbor.

3451
02:14:08,860 --> 02:14:10,100
Pum Pum Puddin.

3452
02:14:11,140 --> 02:14:13,240
I'll be your only neighbor.

3453
02:14:13,540 --> 02:14:14,260
Don't worry.

3454
02:14:15,860 --> 02:14:17,200
Look, I'm your colors.

3455
02:14:17,380 --> 02:14:18,580
I'm your Oshii colors.

3456
02:14:20,260 --> 02:14:23,100
No one told me there'd be so much walking for this trip.

3457
02:14:23,220 --> 02:14:23,880
No one told me there'd be so much walking for this trip.

3458
02:14:23,900 --> 02:14:25,120
Can I talk to you?

3459
02:14:25,900 --> 02:14:26,620
What's up?

3460
02:14:26,760 --> 02:14:27,960
Any tips about this?

3461
02:14:28,380 --> 02:14:31,240
Okay, I don't care about Kadopi.

3462
02:14:31,360 --> 02:14:32,500
I only care about you.

3463
02:14:32,820 --> 02:14:35,560
I only care about you, Pum Pum Puddin.

3464
02:14:36,960 --> 02:14:37,880
Alright, guys.

3465
02:14:39,480 --> 02:14:40,000
Guys.

3466
02:14:40,100 --> 02:14:42,900
I think this was a good place to call it.

3467
02:14:42,980 --> 02:14:43,740
Oh my god.

3468
02:14:43,780 --> 02:14:44,040
The...

3469
02:14:46,860 --> 02:14:47,800
I hate...

3470
02:14:47,800 --> 02:14:49,540
I met all my Oshis.

3471
02:14:52,840 --> 02:14:53,880
I met all my Oshis.

3472
02:14:53,880 --> 02:14:57,380
I think this is a good place to call it here.

3473
02:14:57,640 --> 02:15:00,220
I met all my Oshis today.

3474
02:15:00,420 --> 02:15:01,320
And I think I'm gonna...

3475
02:15:01,320 --> 02:15:04,620
I wanna leave it on a high note of leaving all the Oshis.

3476
02:15:05,340 --> 02:15:07,180
The iPad agrees.

3477
02:15:07,940 --> 02:15:08,700
The iPad agrees.

3478
02:15:08,700 --> 02:15:09,440
Thank you for the super chat.

3479
02:15:09,520 --> 02:15:10,160
Thank you, thank you.

3480
02:15:10,160 --> 02:15:11,520
How to be parasocial.

3481
02:15:11,540 --> 02:15:13,200
You don't understand.

3482
02:15:14,340 --> 02:15:15,820
I do it for them.

3483
02:15:16,620 --> 02:15:17,660
You like that meme?

3484
02:15:17,820 --> 02:15:18,560
Do it for her?

3485
02:15:18,920 --> 02:15:20,180
Do it for them.

3486
02:15:20,180 --> 02:15:21,420
Do it.

3487
02:15:22,160 --> 02:15:24,860
I got my meet and greet, guys.

3488
02:15:25,280 --> 02:15:26,000
Yay!

3489
02:15:26,600 --> 02:15:28,360
I met everybody.

3490
02:15:28,480 --> 02:15:30,260
Meet and greet accomplished.

3491
02:15:31,120 --> 02:15:31,860
Yay!

3492
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:37,340
You don't understand.

3493
02:15:38,340 --> 02:15:40,500
They are my Oshis.

3494
02:15:40,620 --> 02:15:42,100
I got a photo.

3495
02:15:42,540 --> 02:15:43,500
And I got...

3496
02:15:43,500 --> 02:15:45,800
I got my meet and greet.

3497
02:15:46,040 --> 02:15:48,480
And they accepted my gifts too.

3498
02:15:50,180 --> 02:15:51,220
I had a great time though.

3499
02:15:51,540 --> 02:15:52,700
This game seems fun.

3500
02:15:52,740 --> 02:15:53,840
I wish it wasn't region locked.

3501
02:15:54,080 --> 02:15:55,560
I'm so surprised.

3502
02:15:55,780 --> 02:15:57,180
That it's region locked.

3503
02:15:57,420 --> 02:15:58,520
I thought this was like...

3504
02:15:58,520 --> 02:16:00,580
I thought it would be like outside...

3505
02:16:00,580 --> 02:16:02,460
Like people outside of NA can play it.

3506
02:16:02,560 --> 02:16:03,200
Maybe EU?

3507
02:16:04,040 --> 02:16:06,380
Can EU people download Hello Kitty Island Adventures?

3508
02:16:06,900 --> 02:16:09,740
Cause like I know like for Asia you can't.

3509
02:16:09,740 --> 02:16:10,200
Apparently.

3510
02:16:10,560 --> 02:16:15,360
Cause my dad's Asia account couldn't download Hello Kitty Island Adventures.

3511
02:16:16,340 --> 02:16:17,620
That's so weird.

3512
02:16:18,140 --> 02:16:19,520
But it was so good.

3513
02:16:19,560 --> 02:16:20,160
I can't talk about it.

3514
02:16:20,180 --> 02:16:21,520
I don't mean all my Oshis.

3515
02:16:23,480 --> 02:16:24,780
Oh my god.

3516
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:27,000
There's multiplayer.

3517
02:16:27,460 --> 02:16:29,820
I didn't bring up the multiplayer cause I was worried.

3518
02:16:29,900 --> 02:16:30,500
I was scared.

3519
02:16:30,920 --> 02:16:32,920
Additional parental permission.

3520
02:16:33,320 --> 02:16:34,640
You can change this.

3521
02:16:35,020 --> 02:16:37,700
Online features enabled.

3522
02:16:38,340 --> 02:16:38,760
Oh!

3523
02:16:40,380 --> 02:16:41,280
Invite code.

3524
02:16:41,460 --> 02:16:44,300
I can send an invite code or something.

3525
02:16:44,780 --> 02:16:46,260
Wait what is my invite code?

3526
02:16:46,480 --> 02:16:47,660
Apparently there's like multiplayer.

3527
02:16:48,040 --> 02:16:49,040
I'm like looking through it.

3528
02:16:50,180 --> 02:16:50,720
There's multiplayer and everything.

3529
02:16:51,100 --> 02:16:52,740
How do I change my colors?

3530
02:16:53,340 --> 02:16:55,160
I'm looking through this right now.

3531
02:16:55,540 --> 02:16:59,180
You guys can't see it but like I'm looking through it myself just in case.

3532
02:16:59,720 --> 02:16:59,840
Hahaha.

3533
02:17:00,720 --> 02:17:01,240
Uh.

3534
02:17:01,460 --> 02:17:03,120
Thank you for the super chat.

3535
02:17:03,220 --> 02:17:03,480
Thank you.

3536
02:17:03,540 --> 02:17:04,480
Cute stream.

3537
02:17:04,660 --> 02:17:05,880
Oh my god I got a dress.

3538
02:17:08,180 --> 02:17:09,240
Oh my god.

3539
02:17:09,720 --> 02:17:12,300
Guys there's daily rewards and everything.

3540
02:17:13,040 --> 02:17:14,980
How do I change my colors though?

3541
02:17:15,100 --> 02:17:17,260
It doesn't tell me how to change the colors.

3542
02:17:18,100 --> 02:17:18,700
Hahaha.

3543
02:17:20,800 --> 02:17:22,140
Oh my god.

3544
02:17:22,260 --> 02:17:24,660
Can they give me stuff if I...

3545
02:17:24,980 --> 02:17:25,280
Hahaha.

3546
02:17:26,520 --> 02:17:27,120
Hahaha.

3547
02:17:29,460 --> 02:17:30,860
Oh my god.

3548
02:17:30,920 --> 02:17:31,080
Wait.

3549
02:17:32,360 --> 02:17:32,960
JL...

3550
02:17:32,960 --> 02:17:34,000
Wait.

3551
02:17:34,660 --> 02:17:35,620
Okay we actually don't.

3552
02:17:35,680 --> 02:17:37,000
I'm not gonna say what the last one is.

3553
02:17:37,100 --> 02:17:37,800
Alright never mind.

3554
02:17:37,980 --> 02:17:44,200
I don't know how to detox me if I have somebody join my fucking room.

3555
02:17:44,200 --> 02:17:45,140
Never mind.

3556
02:17:45,200 --> 02:17:46,380
I didn't see the last two.

3557
02:17:46,460 --> 02:17:48,100
I didn't see the last two.

3558
02:17:48,240 --> 02:17:48,800
Hahaha.

3559
02:17:50,260 --> 02:17:51,700
I got worried.

3560
02:17:52,300 --> 02:17:52,860
Hahaha.

3561
02:17:54,500 --> 02:17:56,080
I was like wait.

3562
02:17:56,300 --> 02:18:01,440
What would it look like if somebody tries to join my room?

3563
02:18:02,020 --> 02:18:02,580
Hahaha.

3564
02:18:02,900 --> 02:18:03,800
I almost.

3565
02:18:04,020 --> 02:18:05,780
Guys sorry I got too excited.

3566
02:18:06,100 --> 02:18:07,920
I got way too excited.

3567
02:18:07,960 --> 02:18:09,260
I was like oh my god.

3568
02:18:09,440 --> 02:18:10,200
We can like.

3569
02:18:10,200 --> 02:18:11,940
You can like give me free stuff.

3570
02:18:12,120 --> 02:18:13,260
In my world.

3571
02:18:13,500 --> 02:18:13,960
Hahaha.

3572
02:18:16,100 --> 02:18:16,620
Oh.

3573
02:18:16,620 --> 02:18:17,440
That's fun.

3574
02:18:18,440 --> 02:18:19,900
I'm glad I got to finally.

3575
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:21,160
Fully experience.

3576
02:18:21,620 --> 02:18:24,000
Hello Kitty Island Adventure.

3577
02:18:24,360 --> 02:18:25,720
Finally for reals now.

3578
02:18:25,920 --> 02:18:26,680
I'm so happy.

3579
02:18:26,920 --> 02:18:28,400
I've always wanted to play this game.

3580
02:18:28,700 --> 02:18:29,440
And uh.

3581
02:18:29,660 --> 02:18:30,720
You dumb me.

3582
02:18:30,820 --> 02:18:31,840
It's okay I didn't.

3583
02:18:31,860 --> 02:18:34,900
I didn't say out.

3584
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,860
There was like two more letters that I didn't say out.

3585
02:18:38,060 --> 02:18:39,000
So thank god.

3586
02:18:39,160 --> 02:18:39,520
You guys.

3587
02:18:39,600 --> 02:18:40,000
Hahaha.

3588
02:18:40,200 --> 02:18:42,120
I closed the game too.

3589
02:18:42,300 --> 02:18:42,820
Hahaha.

3590
02:18:44,660 --> 02:18:46,540
I closed the game.

3591
02:18:46,660 --> 02:18:47,620
Just to be sure.

3592
02:18:47,920 --> 02:18:49,200
Just to be sure.

3593
02:18:49,580 --> 02:18:51,280
I didn't accidentally.

3594
02:18:51,960 --> 02:18:53,040
Fuck up.

3595
02:18:53,080 --> 02:18:54,960
I closed the game as well.

3596
02:18:55,220 --> 02:18:55,800
Hahaha.

3597
02:18:58,240 --> 02:18:59,560
Oh my god.

3598
02:18:59,760 --> 02:19:01,340
I can't believe it.

3599
02:19:01,520 --> 02:19:02,540
I met Kuromi.

3600
02:19:03,080 --> 02:19:06,240
I met Kuromi.

3601
02:19:06,600 --> 02:19:07,980
I met Tsunamaru.

3602
02:19:08,460 --> 02:19:09,560
I met PomPomPurin.

3603
02:19:10,200 --> 02:19:11,320
I met Tetsuko and Kutama.

3604
02:19:11,740 --> 02:19:13,760
I don't care about the other ones I met.

3605
02:19:13,860 --> 02:19:16,260
I can't believe all my favorite characters.

3606
02:19:16,580 --> 02:19:18,380
Were like locked behind quests.

3607
02:19:19,060 --> 02:19:20,240
That was so fucked up.

3608
02:19:20,480 --> 02:19:22,360
Of course like the ones I don't care.

3609
02:19:22,580 --> 02:19:24,600
Or the ones I have to communicate with first.

3610
02:19:24,920 --> 02:19:25,400
Hahaha.

3611
02:19:26,280 --> 02:19:26,760
Hahaha.

3612
02:19:27,260 --> 02:19:29,540
I met all my Oshis.

3613
02:19:29,700 --> 02:19:30,180
Yay.

3614
02:19:31,740 --> 02:19:32,400
Anyway guys.

3615
02:19:32,640 --> 02:19:33,980
I had a great time.

3616
02:19:34,200 --> 02:19:36,380
I hope you guys had a great time watching.

3617
02:19:36,540 --> 02:19:38,120
Even though it was just me fangirling.

3618
02:19:38,120 --> 02:19:40,360
About my Sanrio Oshis.

3619
02:19:40,520 --> 02:19:41,140
Hahaha.

3620
02:19:42,480 --> 02:19:43,160
Hahaha.

3621
02:19:43,160 --> 02:19:43,520
Hahaha.

3622
02:19:44,960 --> 02:19:47,480
But I had a great time.

3623
02:19:47,540 --> 02:19:48,580
Hanging out with you guys.

3624
02:19:48,660 --> 02:19:51,700
I'm sorry the stream was an hour delayed.

3625
02:19:52,180 --> 02:19:52,840
Hahaha.

3626
02:19:53,940 --> 02:19:56,920
With all the stuff going on.

3627
02:19:57,100 --> 02:19:58,400
I'm so sorry.

3628
02:19:58,560 --> 02:20:00,480
The stream was an hour delayed.

3629
02:20:00,860 --> 02:20:01,440
But now.

3630
02:20:01,800 --> 02:20:03,140
Now I know.

3631
02:20:04,120 --> 02:20:05,440
Now I know.

3632
02:20:05,440 --> 02:20:07,300
So I hope you guys still had a great time watching.

3633
02:20:07,420 --> 02:20:08,600
Even though it was an hour late.

3634
02:20:09,500 --> 02:20:11,780
But I always enjoy streaming for you guys.

3635
02:20:12,020 --> 02:20:12,420
Everybody.

3636
02:20:13,200 --> 02:20:13,760
Yeah no.

3637
02:20:13,860 --> 02:20:14,700
Fuck Apple though.

3638
02:20:14,800 --> 02:20:15,260
Oh my gosh.

3639
02:20:15,280 --> 02:20:17,520
Apple is so fucking convoluted.

3640
02:20:17,540 --> 02:20:18,200
For no reason.

3641
02:20:18,380 --> 02:20:20,640
Like it was so difficult just to log in.

3642
02:20:20,860 --> 02:20:22,340
Like I couldn't believe it.

3643
02:20:22,680 --> 02:20:23,380
Anyway guys.

3644
02:20:23,640 --> 02:20:24,760
As always everybody.

3645
02:20:25,140 --> 02:20:26,000
Stay hydrated.

3646
02:20:26,420 --> 02:20:27,000
Posture check.

3647
02:20:27,120 --> 02:20:27,980
Get up and move around.

3648
02:20:28,060 --> 02:20:29,020
To get that blood flowing.

3649
02:20:29,180 --> 02:20:30,460
And if you stay up for me.

02:20:30,680 --> 02:20:31,440
Head to bed.
