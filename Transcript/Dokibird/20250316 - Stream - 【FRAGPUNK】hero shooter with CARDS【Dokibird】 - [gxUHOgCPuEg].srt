00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:43,930
Hello everybody!

2
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:45,510
Hello, hello!

3
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:51,850
Alright, so today we are gonna be checking out the game FragPunk.

4
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:59,010
Apparently, a lot of people have been talking about this game because it is another hero shooter.

5
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,430
Yes, another one.

6
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:04,010
It actually has a lot of reviews on Steam.

7
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:09,690
I think it's because it's not as popular right now as it should be.

8
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,650
Because of Marble Rivals, not gonna lie.

9
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:20,650
Because Marble Rivals has overtaken the shooter world.

10
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:33,230
Any other shooting games, either it's first person or third person, sort of gets overshadowed by Marble Rivals in general.

11
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:39,390
So basically, FragPunk is a tactical shooter.

12
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:44,030
I know, as a resident can never understand tactical shooter player.

13
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:49,370
But I understand hero shooters.

14
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:53,890
But like, my brain still cannot comprehend tactical shooters yet.

15
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,030
Or will never.

16
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:55,950
Or never will.

17
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:56,510
I don't know.

18
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,630
I'm just too impatient for it.

19
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:02,950
But there is a little twist regarding FragPunk.

20
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:05,270
Because it is also...

21
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,370
They always do this.

22
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:10,050
They always try to be like, we are a tactical shooter with a twist.

23
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,370
But basically, it's sort of like...

24
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:18,290
They say that they're like high movement and stuff like that.

25
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:21,650
But I assume the TTK is also incredibly low.

26
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:27,510
But the twist is that you use... there is a card system.

27
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:32,450
So you can build a card deck to change the round of each game.

28
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:36,430
So every player has its own cards that they can activate.

29
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:39,950
And that is the twist for this game.

30
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,390
It has a lot of reviews.

31
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,950
It is also free to play.

32
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:50,210
I honestly think if this game released at a later time, it would be very popular.

33
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:59,570
It literally has 22,000 reviews for a game that came out last week.

34
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:07,350
So I legitimately think that if this game came out later in the year, it could be really popular.

35
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:11,810
But Marvel Rivals is still at its peak in terms of popularity.

36
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:16,290
So it definitely got overshadowed by it.

37
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,630
But yeah, I've never tried it before.

38
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:25,110
I saw a lot of people were talking about it for like two...

39
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:32,670
I'm pretty sure it was just a lot of people who were sponsored were playing it.

40
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:38,910
Yeah, I think it's also because a lot of the content creators who normally play FPS games or shooter games are just playing Rivals.

41
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,150
So they're not really playing FragPunk.

42
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:44,570
But I heard their player base is still really high.

43
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,130
It's still pretty decent.

44
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:53,090
It's just that unfortunately, a lot of the content creators only played the game for like two to three days.

45
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:55,750
And then they just swapped over to Rivals.

46
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,090
Back to...

47
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:00,150
Back to Rivals.

48
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:03,590
But yeah, I am looking forward to trying it out.

49
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:05,590
Just seeing how it is.

50
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:09,510
I'm not really much of a tactical shooter person, but like I can still aim.

51
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:10,350
I just...

52
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:17,450
My brain just doesn't do well with tactical shooter because I'm not that patient to wait.

53
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:25,930
I'm just not that patient when it comes to tactical shooters.

54
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:32,850
But I am very interested in the card system because I was reading through it.

55
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:39,670
And there's a lot of like there's a lot of random things you can do with the card system like the card deck that you build.

56
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:43,190
So it will be interesting to see.

57
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:46,610
There's also like 1v1 duels as well in the game modes.

58
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,570
So like yeah, I'm going in blind.

59
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:53,470
I haven't seen any actual gameplay footage of Frag Punk.

60
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:58,110
I've only seen like I saw the trailer and that's really it just to see like, okay, what is this about?

61
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:04,710
Like what really what like just to like just see a trailer just to sort of have a good idea going in.

62
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:08,850
But I have not actually watched any streams of it.

63
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:12,290
I just seen like I just seen like streamers mentioning about it.

64
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:17,490
And then it's all like, you know, I saw the Shroud versus like I saw that they did like a Shroud versus TenZ thing.

65
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:20,590
Because TenZ is like heavily sponsored by Frag Punk.

66
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:27,070
And because it is a tactical shooter.

67
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:30,830
So of course it like fits his whole like branding and stuff like that.

68
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:34,310
I think he has like a card in there that's dedicated to TenZ.

69
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,510
So that's all I know about Frag Punk.

70
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,570
But yeah, can't wait to see it.

71
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,790
Anyway, story time.

72
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:46,550
This is a very short story time about Doki Ember Doge.

73
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,370
About that because it was a little freaky.

74
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,270
But basically, this is a quick story time.

75
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,370
I think it was two days ago.

76
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:55,850
I was going to talk about this two days ago.

77
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,250
But I think I wasn't streaming.

78
00:08:58,610 --> 00:08:59,850
I wasn't doing a public stream yesterday.

79
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:04,610
So I want to talk about this like on a public stream because it was a member stream yesterday.

80
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:08,270
But basically, very short story.

81
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:14,690
I normally do his night walks at like 2 to 3 AM.

82
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:21,270
And I woke up at like around 3 AM because I was super tired two days ago.

83
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,230
I mean we all know why.

84
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:26,450
I did like a 7 hour Marvel Rivals grind sesh.

85
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,270
So of course I was really tired.

86
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,710
And I went straight to nap time.

87
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,330
And then I woke up.

88
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:35,510
I was like hey Doki.

89
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,510
Alright dad.

90
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,830
It's walkies time.

91
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,310
Walkies time.

92
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:42,710
And I was just like yippee.

93
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,190
Walkies time.

94
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:44,890
Alright.

95
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:48,210
So I pressed the button for the elevator.

96
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:51,250
And then for some fucking reason.

97
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:55,430
He refused to go in the elevator.

98
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,530
And I was freaked out.

99
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,670
Because I was like it's 3 in the morning.

100
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:01,990
Why do you not want to go into this elevator?

101
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,810
Like I was trying to pull him into the elevator.

102
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,950
And he refused to go in.

103
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,970
And that actually freaked me out.

104
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:10,410
Because I was like oh my god.

105
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,590
And then I was like.

106
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,790
Oh maybe he just doesn't want to go downstairs.

107
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,370
And then so.

108
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:17,970
So then I waited for that elevator.

109
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,370
And then the elevator went down.

110
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:21,590
The craziest part is that.

111
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,530
That elevator went down.

112
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:24,570
Or up I don't know.

113
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:25,270
It like left.

114
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,290
So then I pressed.

115
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,770
Because like after the doors closed.

116
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,390
I pressed the button again.

117
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,010
And then a different elevator.

118
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:32,870
Came back up.

119
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,150
Because usually I'm like.

120
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,170
Who the fuck is also taking the elevator.

121
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,650
At 3 in the morning.

122
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:38,710
I was like really confused.

123
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:39,110
Because usually.

124
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,150
Like you know.

125
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:41,150
The elevator is all free.

126
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:42,390
Like there's 3 different elevators.

127
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:43,330
And you're usually all free.

128
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:44,290
At 3 in the morning.

129
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:46,330
Because who else is out there.

130
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:47,610
Being a freak like me.

131
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:48,770
Walking my dog.

132
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:49,930
At 3 in the morning.

133
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:51,470
And then so like.

134
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:52,770
The moment the door closes.

135
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:53,690
I was like.

136
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,570
I'm gonna press the button.

137
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:55,410
And I waited like.

138
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:56,990
One like 4 seconds.

139
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:58,450
And usually you know.

140
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,490
It will be the same elevator.

141
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:00,070
Unless.

142
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,490
Unless someone else takes it.

143
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,190
And then.

144
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,450
I pressed again.

145
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,690
And it was a different elevator.

146
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,230
I had to wait for a different elevator.

147
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,290
And he was fine.

148
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:09,210
He was.

149
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:10,250
Fine.

150
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:11,030
With going in.

151
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:11,490
I was like.

152
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:11,730
Alright.

153
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:12,410
Let's go in.

154
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:12,910
And he was like.

155
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:13,210
Alright.

156
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:13,770
Yay.

157
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:15,250
He like.

158
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:17,510
He didn't avoid the elevator at all.

159
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:18,130
He was just like.

160
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:18,430
Okay.

161
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:19,310
Like it was normal.

162
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:20,370
And then I.

163
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:22,030
I was so freaked out.

164
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:22,730
Because I was like.

165
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,650
Was the other elevator like.

166
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:25,830
Fucking haunted.

167
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:26,170
Like.

168
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,390
I was like.

169
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,250
I was like.

170
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:28,770
I'm like.

171
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:30,330
With the ghost.

172
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,450
Is that elevator gonna.

173
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,250
Was that like.

174
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:33,890
A final destination.

175
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:34,730
Premonition.

176
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:35,730
From my dog.

177
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:36,250
Like.

178
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:37,690
Did he fucking got a vision.

179
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:38,270
From.

180
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:38,570
Like.

181
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:40,230
A final destination vision.

182
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:40,810
And then.

183
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:41,890
We were gonna die.

184
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:43,190
In that fucking elevator.

185
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:44,030
If I.

186
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:46,230
Went to that specific elevator.

187
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:47,370
And I was like.

188
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,350
I was so freaked out.

189
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,070
Two days ago.

190
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:50,450

Had.

194
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,490
He's never done that before.

195
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:54,170
By the way chat.

196
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:55,330

197
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:56,390
Um.

198
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:58,330
He has never.

199
00:11:58,890 --> 00:11:59,170
Avoided.

200
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:00,150
An elevator.

201
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:00,550
Before.

202
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:01,250
Like.

203
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:02,450
He would be fine.

204
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:03,530
Going in.

205
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,110
It was.

206
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:05,270
This was the first time.

207
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,370
He refused.

208
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:07,610

00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:08,130

00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:09,590
And he was just.

212
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:10,570
Standing his ground.

213
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:11,150

214
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:11,930

00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:14,390
Mmm.

218
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:17,010
He refused to go in.

219
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:17,970
And.

220
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:18,970

To go in.

274
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:08,890
Was still.

275
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:09,250

Anyway.

284
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,990
That's my story time.

00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:21,690

Stop walking him.

00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:30,750
Much more.

297
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:31,450
Anxious.

298
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:32,010
And like.

299
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:32,930
Paranoid.

300
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:34,130
About the supernatural.

301
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:35,430

302
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:35,730
You know.

00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:37,570
And then like.

305
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,710
Anything can happen.

00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:40,010
In three in the morning.

307
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,190
No.

308
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:45,390

I need to start.

312
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,450
I need to stop doing that.

313
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:51,090

Hi Doki.

You missed my super chat yesterday.

321
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:58,330
It was my birthday.

322
00:13:58,450 --> 00:13:59,490
Can I get a happy potty?

323
00:13:59,550 --> 00:13:59,990
Of course.

324
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:00,330

Happy belated birthday to you.

329
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:04,670
I'm sorry I missed it.

330
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:05,130
Um.

331
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,750
Happy birthday to you.

332
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:08,630
Happy birthday to you.

Happy birthday dear Winter.

334

00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:13,830
Yeah.

336
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:14,830
Happy birthday.

00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:15,990
Next scene.

338
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,050
Thank you for the super chat.

339
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:17,450
Thank you.

00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:18,130
Thank you.

341
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:18,610
Thank you.

342
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:22,290
Also, the first elevator probably just smelled like a man.

343
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,510
Thank you for the super chat.

344
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:23,850
Thank you.

345
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:24,250
Thank you.

346
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:26,950
Also, today he got into a fight with several dogs.

347
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,530
Well, I won't say got into a fight.

348
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:30,310
Um.

349
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:33,170
He would just see a dog and then he'd be like, no.

350
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:37,550
He'd be like, get away from me.

351
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:39,530
There was a corgi.

352
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:40,750
We were walking.

353
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:44,150
We did a drive by for another dog for the crossroads.

354
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,590
So we walked past the crossroads.

355
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:49,470
And the corgi, like, was so happy to see my dog.

356
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:53,370
And then I thought it was okay because he wasn't barking, you know.

357
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,310
He wasn't barking at all.

358
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,710
And the moment they, like, touched noses.

359
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:58,450
Uh.

360
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,530
Dad was like.

361
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:00,230
No.

362
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:03,670
Like, try to nip the corgi.

363
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:06,070
Like, they were like snout to snout.

364
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:07,770
And then he was like.

365
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,990
He just, like, went for it.

366
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:13,990
And then obviously the corgi freaked out.

367
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:14,730
Because he was like.

368
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:15,590
I was like.

369
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:16,770
I thought we were.

370
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,350
I thought we were friends.

371
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,030
I thought we were going to be friends.

372
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:21,630
Like, it was so.

373
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,130
I thought it was going to be okay.

374
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,990
Because he didn't bark at the corgi, too.

375
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:25,730
He literally.

376
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,410
They were like nose to nose.

377
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:29,450
The corgi was, like, so happy.

378
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,330
And then he just went for it.

379
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:34,630
The corgi was like.

380
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:35,630
Not friend.

381
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:36,810
And dad was like.

382
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:38,050
Not friend.

383
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:41,390
And then he just starts barking.

384
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,390
He just actually starts barking.

385
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,270
And I have to pull him away.

386
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:44,570
I'm like.

387
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:45,410
I'm so sorry.

388
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:46,830
I'm.

389
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:48,730
I'm so sorry.

390
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:49,470
But, like.

391
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,730
I think it's just because he's trying to protect me.

392
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,470
Because when he's with the babysitter.

393
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,350
He loves hanging out with other dogs.

394
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:57,450
Like, he's like.

395
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:57,930
Yay!

396
00:15:58,370 --> 00:15:58,690
Friends!

397
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:00,210
Because the babysitter is like.

398
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,610
Is it okay if I babysit.

399
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,290
Like, if I have another dog here.

400
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,170
Like, if it's an emergency.

401
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:04,690
Like, you know.

402
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:05,310
If I'm sick.

403
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,170
Or, like.

404
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:06,910
If I had to, like.

405
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:07,750
Get babysitter.

406
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:08,670
Or dog sitter.

407
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:09,690
At the last minute.

408
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:11,750
The dog sitter would be like.

409
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,630
Is it okay if we have another dog.

410
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:14,410
In the apartment.

411
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:14,850
Or, like.

412
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:15,130
I'm sorry.

413
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:15,610
In the house.

414
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:16,070
And they're like.

415
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:16,290
Yeah.

416
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:16,550
No.

417
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:16,810
I was like.

418
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:17,030
Yeah.

419
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:17,910
It should be fine.

420
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:18,270
Like.

421
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:20,050
And then, like.

422
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:20,450
She's like.

423
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:20,690
Yeah.

424
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,230
Oh my god.

425
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,010
He did so well with the other dog.

426
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:23,630
So, like.

427
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,410
He's okay with other dogs.

428
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:25,930
When, like.

429
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:26,890
We're not on walks.

430
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:27,310
I think.

431
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:27,930
When, like.

432
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:29,030
I'm not with him.

433
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:29,690
But, like.

434
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:31,970
He's not okay with other dogs.

435
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:33,050
When it's just me and him.

436
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:33,870
It's actually.

437
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:34,430
I don't know.

438
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:36,290
I don't know what the fuck is going on in his head.

439
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:36,670
I.

440
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:39,910
Not so.

441
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,750
Thank you for the super chat.

442
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:42,090
Thank you.

443
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:42,630
Thank you.

444
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:44,590
First, a mystery flip phone.

445
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:46,550
Now, the ghost elevator.

446
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:52,410
Doki is missing all her side quests on the AM dad walk.

447
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:54,090
Thank you for the super chat.

448
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:54,570
Thank you.

449
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:55,270
Thank you.

450
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:56,130
J1.

451
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:56,910
Thank you for the super chat.

452
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:57,290
Thank you.

453
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,070
Thank you.

454
00:16:59,230 --> 00:16:59,670
Um.

455
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:00,970
Um.

456
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:01,250
But.

457
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:02,030
That's why.

458
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:02,670
I'm very.

459
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:03,070
Also.

460
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,130
To address your thing.

461
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:04,410
That's why.

462
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:04,690
I'm like.

463
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:05,390
Very secretive.

464
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:05,550
Like.

465
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,690
Very private about my personal life.

466
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:08,130
Guys.

467
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:08,790
Um.

468
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:09,010
But, yes.

469
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,170
Thank you for the super chat.

470
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:10,550
Thank you.

471
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:11,350
Thank you.

472
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:12,150
Anyway.

473
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:13,150
Um.

474
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,230
Let's check out.

475
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:14,950
Frack bug.

476
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:16,670
Um.

477
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:17,790
So.

478
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:18,490
Yeah.

479
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:19,150
I booted.

480
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:19,310
I.

481
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,050
I have not boot.

482
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:20,990
I booted the game.

483
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:21,830
Before the stream.

484
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:23,650
But, then it showed a cut scene.

485
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:24,690
And then.

486
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:25,110
Like.

487
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,150
I didn't close the game.

488
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:26,710
Cause I was like.

489
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,530
So, I hope we still get the cut scene.

490
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,070
Cause I was like.

491
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:29,510
Oh.

492
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,030
Maybe.

493
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:31,590
Chat would want to see this.

494
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,050
So.

495
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:33,770
So.

496
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:34,590
We'll see.

497
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:35,050
I was like.

498
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:35,250
Oh.

499
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:35,530
Maybe.

500
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:38,110
Chat would want to see this cut scene.

501
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:39,710
Alright.

502
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:40,570
Let's see.

503
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:44,680
Alright.

504
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,740
Let's see if it works.

505
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:47,960
Uh.

506
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,880
I hope we still get the cut scene then.

507
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,740
I hope we still get it.

508
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:53,740
Uh.

509
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:54,980
I'm booting it up.

510
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:55,300
Okay.

511
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:55,880
Frack bug.

512
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,080
I hope we didn't miss it.

513
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:58,740
Uh.

514
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:03,070
Okay.

515
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,130
Why is it not playing?

516
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,030
Where's the sound?

517
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:05,890
Oh.

518
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:06,170
Okay.

519
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,270
I just didn't tab in.

520
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:08,050
I...

521
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:09,010
I was like.

522
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:09,590
No.

523
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:10,650
Did I...

524
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:12,570
Did it not give me the cut scene?

525
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:15,030
Because I skipped it?

526
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:16,830
Oh.

527
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:19,950
I didn't even get to see the cut scene, guys.

528
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,200
No.

529
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:27,560
I wanted to see the cut scene.

530
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,380
That's messed up.

531
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:33,320
Okay.

532
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,180
Entering game.

533
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,000
No.

534
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,900
It looked so good.

535
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:42,370
Alright.

536
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:43,250
Uh.

537
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:43,870
Yeah.

538
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:44,290
Okay.

539
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,930
Let's do voice chat.

540
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:46,970
Uh.

541
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:48,310
Push the talk button.

542
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,090
How do I change my push the talk button?

543
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,070
Voice input.

544
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:53,110
It won't let me.

545
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:53,830
Okay.

546
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:54,490
That's fine.

547
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:56,830
Anti-dizziness preset.

548
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:57,710
Sure.

549
00:18:59,010 --> 00:18:59,530
Anti...

550
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:03,150
I mean, I don't get motion sickness, so it doesn't really matter for me.

551
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:03,610
Oh.

552
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:04,750
I'm so sad.

553
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:06,870
I didn't get to see the cut scene.

554
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:06,910
I didn't get to see the cut scene.

555
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:09,030
That's a cool cut scene.

556
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,510
The music's dope, though.

557
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:12,590
I like the music.

558
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:14,490
Alright.

559
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,770
To keep our community safe, we record nice.

560
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:17,510
Thank you, Spy.

561
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,610
I love it when they keep my data.

562
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,290
That's my favorite.

563
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:22,970
It's alright.

564
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,630
Everybody has my data already.

565
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:26,550
So, what's...

566
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,750
So, what's wrong with one more company?

567
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:32,390
That's alright.

568
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:34,990
One more company having my data?

569
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:36,770
That's alright.

570
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,910
I'm not linking my account though.

571
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,650
So true.

572
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:43,930
So real.

573
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:49,630
I already have several Gmail accounts, and I say yes to accept all cookies.

574
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,770
There's the card system!

575
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,650
I like the graphics for this.

576
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,840
Is that me?

577
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:22,080
Is that what we call the hero slash agent slash legend slash... are we Lancers?

578
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:28,120
I like how every game has to have its own word for the character they select.

579
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,800
Because they all want to be special.

580
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:38,540
My Lancer, Agent, Legend, Hero...

581
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,880
Pick your Lancers, guys.

582
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,380
They don't want to be copyrighted.

583
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,680
My operative, be true.

584
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,340
My operative...

585
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,340
Jesus Christ, okay.

586
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:07,020
Alright, bring up the overall volume and then...

587
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,880
Uh, alright, let me...

588
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,440
Contact customer service?

589
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,840
There's a customer service?

590
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,480
Alright, uh...

591
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,820
Hold forward, back, sir, melee?

592
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,800
There's a melee weapon.

593
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,680
Uh, jumps, Jesus, okay.

594
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,080
Jumps, okay, walk, hold, last...

595
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,920
Whoa, okay, guys, sorry.

596
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:33,700
I sort of get overwhelmed when I'm not familiar with the settings, guys.

597
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:42,180
When I'm not... when I'm not familiar with the settings, it's just... whoa, that's... whoa, that's a lot, okay.

598
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,900
There's just a lot going in here.

599
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,100
Let's see...

600
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:57,260
Oh, no, Doki, you're getting doxxed.

601
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,680
Is that your real... no.

602
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,360
Okay, here's some lore.

603
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:04,000
Okay, the reason why this says Sunny...

604
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,400
is that that is the name of my very first dog.

605
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:13,460
And, um, I always, like, have accounts named after my very first dog.

606
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,420
And his name was Sunny.

607
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,620
So that's, like, a little lore behind the... behind the scenes.

608
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:20,740
Uh...

609
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:26,200
Oh, my, you doxxed your first dog?

610
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,760
I can't believe it.

611
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,640
All right, he's dead, guys.

612
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,480
Like, he's been dead for years, guys.

613
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,840
It's my very first dog.

614
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:35,840
How am I...

615
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,140
Yankie cares?

616
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:40,180
I can't ask permission on a dog that's not alive.

617
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,360
Don't say that.

618
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:46,300
To be fair, I don't even ask dad's permission on things.

619
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,120
You doxxed your dead dog.

620
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:52,870
That's so...

621
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:53,880
Fuck, guys.

622
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,440
It's been a long time.

623
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,420
When I say first dog, I meant that dog... I had, like, that dog...

624
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,340
was around before I was born.

625
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,980
So, like, I had... guys, I had time to move on.

626
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,440
Guys, I had a lot of time to move on from that.

627
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:15,420
Uh, 0.58.

628
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:17,600
Um...

629
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:25,400
But yeah, I always have, like, my PCs are always named after, uh, my... so it's been, like, 70 years.

630
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:31,180
Uh, so my PC has been named after... I always name my PCs after him.

631
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:35,540
And, uh, and also, um...

632
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:41,160
Um, that's why I like the color yellow a lot, because it was based off of my dog's name, Sunny.

633
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:44,180
And it just reminds me of my first dog a lot.

634
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,140
And also, like, you know, I was like, oh, Sunny, like, yellow.

635
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:51,080
You know, so that's why, like, um, that's why yellow...

636
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,420
What is my favorite color, too?

637
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,980
Uh, because it just reminds me of my first dog.

638
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,440
Um, little Laura there.

639
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,380
Uh, for those who are wondering what kind of breed he was, he was...

640
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,060
He was a really fancy breed.

641
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:04,940
He was a purebred.

642
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:11,280
Um, I know because my parents will always brag about, like, how he was, like, a bushy dog.

643
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,060
It was, uh, what are they called?

644
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,700
They're not Eskimo dogs.

645
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:18,700
They're...

646
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:23,120
They're, like, uh, long-haired white dog.

647
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:25,540
Um...

648
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:28,080
Oh, yeah, they're... What are these called?

649
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:29,380
Samoyed.

650
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,200
Yeah, yeah.

651
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,120
He was, uh...

652
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:38,180
He was a Samoyed, and his parents, uh, he was a purebred Samoyed.

653
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,000
I don't know if I'm, like, pronouncing correctly.

654
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:45,460
And his parents were, like, award-winning dogs, uh, back then.

655
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:55,100
And when I was little, I remembered I would, like, tie... When I was, like, a little... a little bird, I would, um, tie my...

656
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,400
Oh, I remember it was back then.

657
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:03,800
I had a scooter, and I would, like, tie my, uh, my, like, leash... his leash to my scooter, and he would pull me around.

658
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:04,580
I was, like, yay!

659
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,620
I'd be, like, yay!

660
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:10,840
Yay!

661
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:18,100
So those were, like, some happy memories I had, uh, with him.

662
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,860
But he was, like, he was very pretty.

663
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:30,800
Um, I mean, he was a fucking purebred, like, parents were actual high-class, uh, beauty contest winners or some fucking shit.

664
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,320
And, uh, apparently very expensive.

665
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:38,160
Um, and yeah, that's why, uh, he was a great... He was a great first dog.

666
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:41,340
Uh, they're terrible guard dogs.

667
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:44,640
Yeah, he was a... I don't think he was, like, aggressive at all.

668
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:48,040
He was never, like, super aggressive.

669
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:53,280
Um, and he was always, like, super friendly from what I remembered back then was a little bird.

670
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,840
Uh, but yeah, a little lure there, a little...

671
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,480
little, like, lure drop there.

672
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:08,800
And then when I... and then we also, as I got older, um, uh, we also got a second dog, and his name was, uh, Bobo.

673
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,360
And he was, like, my first wiener dog.

674
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,940
And because I was like, I want to... I want a second dog.

675
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,400
I want to pick my dog breed.

676
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:20,480
Because I was like, you guys gotta pick a dog breed.

677
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,080
I want to pick a dog, and I want it to be an inside dog.

678
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:27,320
Because Sonny was never allowed inside our house.

679
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:32,520
Um, because he sheds... he sheds, uh, dog's dog number two.

680
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,540
Anyway, um, yeah, that's right, Bobo.

681
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,520
That was his first name.

682
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:47,160
And, and he was also, like, black and, uh, brown, like, like, you know, like Dad.

683
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:55,120
And, uh, and, uh, I wanted an inside dog because, like, Sonny was not allowed inside because he shed a lot.

684
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,240
So, like, I wanted an inside dog.

685
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:01,920
So my parents let me pick, uh, went to the pet store, and he... they let me pick a dog.

686
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:09,680
Um, and, you know, this was back then when people didn't realize that buying dogs from the pet store was not a great idea.

687
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,140
You know, that was back then.

688
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,780
We didn't know back then, okay?

689
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:21,060
We didn't know buying dogs at the pet shop was, like, not a great thing to do, okay?

690
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,820
That was old times.

691
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,820
We didn't know.

692
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:31,540
But anyway, Bobo was also a purebred dachshund, a purebred wiener dog.

693
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,760
And, um, and he... he was a fucking menace.

694
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:47,600
Like, every time we, like, let him, like, we... because we had, like, a gate, um, that would lead down to where Sonny is, uh, outside.

695
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:57,200
So then, like, we had to put on these, like, um, these, like, gate covers, like, these whole gate covers because, like, it's like a gate.

696
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:06,180
So he would... Bobo would slide through the gate to get to Sonny and then get... slide through the other gate to run away.

697
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,960
Because he's like, outside!

698
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:10,700
Yeah!

699
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:20,360
So we had to cover the gates with these, like, wire stuff so it wouldn't... because, like, it was... okay, I'll give a visual for it.

700
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,060
I'm sorry.

701
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:21,780
I'm not playing.

702
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:26,840
I'll give a visual as to what this would look like.

703
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,560
I'm gonna try it out on Payne real quick.

704
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,340
So, okay, so...

705
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:37,340
So the gate would look like this and then the dog would be like, yay!

706
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,000
Oh, wait.

707
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,160
Okay, let's see.

708
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,500
And then he would be like, yay!

709
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,500
I get to go outside!

710
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:54,040
And then, so, because of that, we had to cover the gate because he would always try...

711
00:28:56,180 --> 00:29:05,840
He would always try to slip through the gate to, like, get to Sonny and then slip through the other gate that's to the outside.

712
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,200
Because he's like, outside!

713
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,280
And he would do this.

714
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,320
So, like, this is basically it.

715
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:18,860
So the gates, you know, vertical-wise, he could slip through it and it didn't matter.

716
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:26,060
It wasn't, like, it wasn't that... Okay, by the way, the gate was, like, supposed... It wasn't even, like, that wide.

717
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:29,300
He could, like, just slip through it.

718
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,660
Like, he actually, like, forced himself through the gate hole.

719
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:44,920
So because of that, we had to, like, put these covers in there to make it so he couldn't and he would still try to slip through.

720
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,060
And, like, he would, like, jump.

721
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,800
He would try to jump through, like, here.

722
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:54,620
Like, he'd be like, well, if I can't slip through, I'm gonna jump over it.

723
00:29:54,980 --> 00:30:01,680
And he would, he would try.

724
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,480
It was basically, like, a jailbreak situation.

725
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,200
So he was not allowed.

726
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:06,960
So...

727
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:11,320
So he tried to not allow him, like, to...

728
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:15,640
through that gate too much because he was a fucking menace.

729
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,440
That's so...

730
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,720
Outside!

731
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,000
Yay!

732
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:30,220
Um, but yeah, no, he really loved trying.

733
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,000
He really loved doing the whole prison break situation.

734
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:43,980
Uh, but yeah, anyway, those were the story of my first wiener dog and my very first dog.

735
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,480
I will buy this as a print if it will sign.

736
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:55,600
Anyway, and then there's... and I guess I can... there was the big dog, the big Samoyed, and he was like...

737
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,580
He's just like...

738
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,600
He's like, hey there, buddy.

739
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:01,900
Hey there, buddy.

740
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:12,420
And then there's the other dog on the other side and he'd be like, hey there, buddy, what you doing there?

741
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:16,360
What you doing there?

742
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,740
The big chill and relaxed dog.

743
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,420
All right, so that's the other, all right, that's the story of my first two dogs.

744
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,480
All right, back to... back to Frag Punk.

745
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,520
Uh, all right, let's see.

746
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,300
How do I...

747
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,560
How do I do this?

748
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,440
Automatic sprint.

749
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,420
Uh, cameras.

750
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,660
Okay, no camera.

751
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:42,980
Jesus, there's so... no FOV sprint scaling.

752
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:43,540
The fuck?

753
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,400
Why would that ever be a thing?

754
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:46,460
I don't know.

755
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,740
I feel like that's very stupid to have.

756
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,620
Like, why would you ever want to change your FOV?

757
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:57,180
Um, now we know their name and how they look like too.

758
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,460
Oh my god, Doki.

759
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,520
Why would you do that?

760
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,740
Why, how dare you dox them?

761
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,180
Um, Winter, thank you for the super chat.

762
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:09,600
Thank you.

763
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,280
Thank you.

764
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,340
So that's your first pet.

765
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,740
What about your mother's maiden name in elementary school?

766
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,820
You went to.

767
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,080
Thank you for the super chat.

768
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:17,420
Thank you.

769
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,120
Thank you.

770
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,860
Gambit, thank you for the super chat.

771
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:20,140
Thank you.

772
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:20,560
Thank you.

773
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,520
I thought you were just a Dragon Ball fan with the yellow hair.

774
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,480
Thank you for the super chat.

775
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,380
Uh, thank you.

776
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,080
Thank you.

777
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,540
Um, Fudge Top, thank you for the super chat.

778
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:28,820
Thank you.

779
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:29,440
Thank you.

780
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:32,140
I love how Sunny is the absolute opposite of Dad.

781
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:32,960
Imagine if they met.

782
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,420
Bobo sounds so fun though.

783
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,640
I think like it's just a wiener dog thing.

784
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:46,200
They've all been like little menaces throughout my, like all the wiener dogs I've owned have all been like, um, little brats and I don't know where they get that from.

785
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,360
Thank you for the super chat.

786
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:47,720
Thank you.

787
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,480
Thank you.

788
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,960
All right, let me see.

789
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,400
Is there anything else I need to change for this?

790
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:55,760
Uh...

791
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,020
Uh, sensitivity.

792
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,980
I got my sense in.

793
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,580
We're not using a controller.

794
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,120
Full screen.

795
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:03,220
FOV.

796
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,360
I assume 105 should be okay.

797
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,080
Let's see.

798
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,000
Let's just do...

799
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,120
Let's do 1010.

800
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,140
I don't know.

801
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,640
It seems like 1010.

802
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:14,840
I don't know.

803
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,940
Let's just actually 105.

804
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,220
Let's do the center.

805
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:20,480
I don't want it to be too big of a difference.

806
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,740
Visual auto setting.

807
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,140
I mean, we'll just do medium.

808
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:28,020
Usually I put it on low, but like, uh, I'm curious.

809
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,720
I'm actually curious for now.

810
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:30,100
Oh, yeah.

811
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,800
Music to a 70.

812
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,220
Uh...

813
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,640
Voice chat volume.

814
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,480
My push to... Why can't I change my push to talk?

815
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:40,940
Oh, there it is.

816
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:41,520
Okay.

817
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,440
Push to talk.

818
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:42,960
Is that...

819
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,040
All right, that's fine.

820
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,680
And that should be good.

821
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,920
That should be all my settings.

822
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,100
Apply, please.

823
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,220
Uh, Sarah, thank you for the super chat.

824
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:52,580
Thank you.

825
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,220
Thank you.

826
00:33:53,600 --> 00:34:00,920
My dad, when he was younger, literally broke the lock of our backyard gate because he was overly excited to hang out with the neighborhood strays.

827
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,060
Thank you for the super chat.

828
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:02,360
Thank you.

829
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:02,880
Thank you.

830
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,480
But it's still so like...

831
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,700
I'm not a huge fan of the sense.

832
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,340
It's so high.

833
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:13,120
It feels really high for some reason.

834
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,160
From what I'm used to.

835
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,600
Okay, maybe zero.

836
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,560
Maybe I'll turn it down by 10.

837
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,500
Also, the crosshair fucking sucks.

838
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,140
Let me...

839
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,120
Oh my god, this is worse.

840
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:23,900
All right.

841
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,200
Oh, fuck.

842
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,720
Okay, time to make my crosshair, guys.

843
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,120
I use green.

844
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,300
Oh my god.

845
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:31,660
Okay.

846
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:34,920
Uh, give me my center dot, I guess.

847
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,520
Um, we'll use... I use dot.

848
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,860
I think dot is like the best.

849
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:41,560
Um...

850
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,440
Fuck, okay.

851
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,220
Give me a sec.

852
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:50,860
I'm trying to figure out how to uh, fine crosshair.

853
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,340
Static.

854
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,120
I don't care when it moves.

855
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,120
How do I make it bigger?

856
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,700
What the fuck?

857
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,540
Is it thickness?

858
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,460
The fuck?

859
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,900
Why is it like that?

860
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:08,840
What the fuck is wrong with my... Okay, six.

861
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,140
Six.

862
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,560
I guess.

863
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,260
Okay, four.

864
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,060
All right, that should be it.

865
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:15,680
Fine?

866
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,100
Question mark.

867
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,560
Like I don't understand.

868
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,400
Oh shit.

869
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:19,760
Okay.

870
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:20,860
No, that's not fine.

871
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,020
Okay, put all of that on four then.

872
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,560
Okay, that should be fine?

873
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,540
Question mark.

874
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,400
Um, I fuck it.

875
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,440
That works.

876
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,000
I don't need this.

877
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,180
All right, that's good.

878
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,380
Okay, there we go.

879
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,500
We're okay now.

880
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,580
Okay, WASD, crouch.

881
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:48,330
This does not feel like...

882
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:49,190
Good.

883
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:51,050
This does not feel like Apex movement.

884
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:53,810
Okay.

885
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,440
Okay, nice.

886
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,260
Okay, nice.

887
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,580
All right, that's good practice.

888
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:09,520
I don't know if I like the sense at all.

889
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:15,540
Maybe, maybe I'll go do 53 maybe?

890
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:16,540
Okay.

891
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,720
Almost like it isn't Apex.

892
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:19,980
What?

893
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:22,040
They said there'd be Apex-like movement.

894
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,720
No?

895
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,380
But it's a shooter!

896
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:30,440
Okay, press Q to use skill.

897
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:31,260
God.

898
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,480
God.

899
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:33,540
Guard.

900
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,200
Vengeance.

901
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:38,520
Okay.

902
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,220
What an unfortunate name.

903
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:49,240
What an unfortunate name.

904
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:51,280
Let's try out their skills.

905
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,460
Press anywhere to continue.

906
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,820
Click on the lancer list.

907
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,220
You can view and choose different lancers.

908
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:15,460
Okay, there is broker, a shoulder launch rocket that causes explosive damage and knocks back enemies who are within a certain range.

909
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:20,400
Once you select the lancer, click the next button or weapon slots to choose a weapon.

910
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,120
Oh wait, she reads it out for me.

911
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:23,180
Why the fuck am I reading?

912
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,020
Okay.

913
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:29,560
There's the shoulder launch, the throwable gadget.

914
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,060
Oh no, not the smokes.

915
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:34,580
This is one of the reasons why I cannot do tactical shooters.

916
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,380
All the util.

917
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:39,960
I hate util so much.

918
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:45,280
I feel like that's like the biggest problem with Valorant right now.

919
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:48,860
Is that there's so much like every new character.

920
00:37:49,320 --> 00:38:01,980
They add newer utilities and newer like like um visual clutter to the game so that now when you play Valorant at its current state, you can't see anything.

921
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:10,220
The spam is so bad now in Valorant that like it's like where's the gameplay?

922
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,960
It's like where's the game anymore?

923
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:19,860
That's why I can't I can't handle Valorant 2 now at its current state.

924
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:22,740
The visual clutter is just too much for me.

925
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,020
Deploys a...

926
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,500
Oh, this looks like...

927
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,080
She looks like D.Va a little.

928
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:33,080
Deploys a multi-function tactical that can be controlled remotely.

929
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:36,640
Plays a lot for my three pieces of cover across.

930
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:37,780
Throw a sentry turret.

931
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,600
Oh, she's like, what's your name?

932
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:43,240
Um, the one that puts turrets out in Valorant?

933
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,740
Um, I forgot.

934
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,060
Uh...

935
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,140
Pathogen.

936
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,520
Oh, this is basically the green girl.

937
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,980
There was a biomedical device.

938
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:54,380
Oh, wait.

939
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:55,520
No, she can heal.

940
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:00,120
It creates a healing field restoring health on to all allies.

941
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,240
Oh, she's the healer.

942
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:03,100
Enacts a destructo fungus wall.

943
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,620
Throwables that be activated manually.

944
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,660
Lancers will damage over time.

945
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,300
Is immune to poison.

946
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:12,740
Yeah, that's this is like killjoy and the other one is the viper.

947
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:13,260
Yeah.

948
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,840
Loon, thank you for your very first super chat.

949
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,240
Thank you.

950
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,040
Thank you.

951
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:17,780
Hi, Doki.

952
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,800
It's my birthday today.

953
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,640
Been watching you for four years.

954
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,640
Thank you for always making my daily streams.

955
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:23,300
Of course.

956
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,160
Happy birthday, Loon.

957
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,020
Happy birthday to you.

958
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,980
Happy birthday to you.

959
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,040
Happy birthday, dear Loon.

960
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,200
Happy birthday to you.

961
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,480
Yeah, happy birthday!

962
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,940
Let's try nitro.

963
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:38,880
Fuck.

964
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,560
Um, fuck.

965
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:43,460
Which one's the AK?

966
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:50,380
Guys, which one looks like the AK, guys?

967
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,380
Any assault rifle?

968
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,660
Okay.

969
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:02,560
All right.

970
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,160
I can't wait to miss all my shots.

971
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,160
Oh, wait, I can axe too.

972
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:09,540
Wait, there's different damages for the axes as well?

973
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:10,480
Wait.

974
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,560
Why would I?

975
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:15,820
What the fuck?

976
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,340
The axe seems like a stronger weapon.

977
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,000
Then the- it literally has like more damage.

978
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:26,400
Why the fuck would I use- why the fuck would I use a knife?

979
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,160
The speed is the same.

980
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:31,960
No, it's the same.

981
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:32,440
Look.

982
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,700
Look, guys.

983
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,260
It's literally the same.

984
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,080
The charge melee?

985
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,640
There's a charge melee?

986
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,720
Where the fuck does that say?

987
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,620
The stats are all the same.

988
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,980
Oh, do I just run faster with the knife?

989
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,020
I mean, look at- I'm just like wondering.

990
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,220
Um...

991
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,620
Like, look.

992
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,500
Look at that.

993
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,440
I'm like, what's the- Look at that.

994
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,180
Like, see, look.

995
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:03,300
The stats are literally the same in terms of like charge rate and everything.

996
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,760
The damage is stronger.

997
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:10,420
Like- Like, yeah, I'm like, why the fuck would I pick the knife when the damage is higher?

998
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:13,100
I'm so confused.

999
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,580
No, the range is higher too.

1000
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:17,880
The axe has a higher range.

1001
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,140
I'm so confused.

1002
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,120
Why would I ever pick the knife?

1003
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,540
Does it just have better skin?

1004
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,340
Like, no, the fucking attack range on the axe is better too.

1005
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:35,060
That doesn't make any sense because the charge time is 1.5 seconds and it's still 1.5 seconds.

1006
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:36,660
Everything else is the same.

1007
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:39,660
Yeah, the attack frames are the same too.

1008
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,280
Guys, I don't understand.

1009
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,140
Is it just because like the knives have better skins?

1010
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:47,980
No drawbacks?

1011
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:48,940
All right.

1012
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:50,520
I don't understand.

1013
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,500
I just don't understand.

1014
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:54,340
Okay, now let's try out some drawbacks.

1015
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,880
Jesus, the recoil.

1016
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,240
Okay.

1017
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:06,450
Look at him run.

1018
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:09,170
All right, nice.

1019
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:11,090
They're all dead.

1020
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:14,530
Oh, okay.

1021
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:16,350
When you feel like it.

1022
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:19,050
Wait, oh my god, look at this little guy.

1023
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:21,430
Wait, I have to control him?

1024
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:24,090
Look at him go!

1025
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:27,030
Pew!

1026
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:28,430
Pew!

1027
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:32,670
Can I fall off?

1028
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:34,510
No, I can't.

1029
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:35,850
Oh my god.

1030
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:37,170
Okay, so that's that.

1031
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:37,890
What's this?

1032
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:40,170
Okay, there's my wall.

1033
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:42,090
And I can go back.

1034
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:43,150
I can go back down!

1035
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:44,510
Yeah!

1036
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:46,850
Can I break this?

1037
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:48,250
Oh, I can break it in one hit.

1038
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:50,630
Wait, what's the point of having this wall?

1039
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:55,030
Oh, I guess like that?

1040
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:57,570
That's a tiny ass wall.

1041
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:01,310
Okay, and then yeah, it feels like Siege.

1042
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:02,270
And then what's this?

1043
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:06,550
I forgot what this was.

1044
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:09,210
What do you do?

1045
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:11,090
What the fuck do you do?

1046
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:13,170
What is this?

1047
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:14,750
Oh, it's a sentry turret.

1048
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:15,450
Oh, okay.

1049
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:16,330
It's a sentry turret.

1050
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:17,130
All right, let's look at...

1051
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:19,770
Okay, I want to see what her abilities are.

1052
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:22,030
So that's the heal.

1053
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:24,650
And then...

1054
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:28,250
And then this is like the poison, right?

1055
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:30,830
No, this is the poison.

1056
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:33,510
How do I activate?

1057
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:34,950
Okay, this is the poison.

1058
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:37,390
And this is also a wall that I built.

1059
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:39,830
I guess I built this wall too.

1060
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:41,870
I guess.

1061
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:44,930
All right, that's a wall.

1062
00:43:47,010 --> 00:43:49,190
Yeah, that can... Oh, they can block doors?

1063
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:50,670
Oh, it's like a rampart.

1064
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:52,150
A rampart door then.

1065
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:53,910
Oh, I see.

1066
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:55,190
Okay, I see.

1067
00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:56,230
Can I only build two?

1068
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:57,210
I can only build two.

1069
00:43:57,730 --> 00:43:59,230
Okay, what about...

1070
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:02,770
I don't think I want to use... I don't think I want to use broker though.

1071
00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:04,750
Uh...

1072
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:07,110
Smoke... Yeah, I'm not doing smoke shit.

1073
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:08,370
Like, excuse me.

1074
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:09,810
I'm not doing smokes, guys.

1075
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:11,990
I'll never understand smokes.

1076
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:18,510
I'll never understand, chat.

1077
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:22,930
I let someone else smoke... do smoke stuff.

1078
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:25,790
Okay, the shards.

1079
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:33,610
Yeah, smoking's bad for you anyway.

1080
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:39,810
Deploy one combat bot.

1081
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:41,410
Explore... exposes.

1082
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:42,650
This is so RNG.

1083
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:44,830
Can you even make a rank game out of this?

1084
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:45,970
It's so RNG.

1085
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:53,230
I mean, I guess that gold was a gold card?

1086
00:44:53,530 --> 00:44:54,650
It is gold.

1087
00:44:57,190 --> 00:44:59,390
But I could kill my teammates.

1088
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:02,010
Like, this is so RNG.

1089
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:06,070
Yeah,

1090
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,040
but wouldn't getting the cards be RNG as well?

1091
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:27,360
Okay.

1092
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,220
Okay, but it's every...

1093
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:40,280
Wait, I don't want to click that one.

1094
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,840
No, I want the cooler cards.

1095
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:45,780
What?

1096
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:51,890
Wait, I can activate more than one?

1097
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:57,490
Oh shit, okay.

1098
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:01,590
Oh, so each team gets three cards.

1099
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:02,890
Oh.

1100
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:07,950
So each team gets three.

1101
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:10,290
Okay, I get it.

1102
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:12,290
You chose...

1103
00:46:12,290 --> 00:46:13,830
Use your shard card.

1104
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:14,870
Break it.

1105
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:16,210
All right now.

1106
00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:16,910
Oh.

1107
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:20,510
Once you've planted the converter, it'll detect nearby enemies.

1108
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:21,790
Okay, that's interesting.

1109
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:30,430
All right, that's my bomb.

1110
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:32,010
Plant the converter.

1111
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:32,730
Okay.

1112
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:36,330
Wait, it's just me and the bot.

1113
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:39,330
Wait, that's not fair.

1114
00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:40,770
Where's my other teammates?

1115
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:47,570
Wait, how come they get...

1116
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:48,950
That's not fair.

1117
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:50,470
Oh shit.

1118
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:51,910
Oh shit.

1119
00:46:52,450 --> 00:46:53,250
Don't shoot me.

1120
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:54,450
Don't shoot me.

1121
00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:56,030
Oh fuck, wait.

1122
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:58,350
Wait, how do I... Oh my god, I didn't realize.

1123
00:46:58,630 --> 00:46:58,870
Okay.

1124
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:00,450
I didn't realize.

1125
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:02,630
Okay, now you can shoot me.

1126
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:03,750
Okay, sorry.

1127
00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:06,690
I didn't realize this damage was actually fucking terrible.

1128
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:07,790
I...

1129
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:10,550
That was so...

1130
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:15,410
Such... Oh my god, the damage is so low.

1131
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:17,250
What the fuck?

1132
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:17,730
Okay.

1133
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:19,350
Well now I know.

1134
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:22,270
Now I know the damage is fucking low as hell.

1135
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:25,590
All right, me...

1136
00:47:25,590 --> 00:47:26,590
Am I timed?

1137
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:28,610
No, I'm not.

1138
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:29,150
It's practice.

1139
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:31,510
Okay, I just want to up the volume a little bit more.

1140
00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:35,710
Oh my god, the damage was so low on that.

1141
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:36,510
I was not prepared.

1142
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:41,350
Okay, hold for the plant the bomb.

1143
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:45,650
I thought he would do more damage.

1144
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:54,400
Wait, that's it?

1145
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:57,560
That's it?

1146
00:47:58,740 --> 00:47:59,780
Fucking hell.

1147
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:00,940
Get out of here.

1148
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,560
That's it for the eyes?

1149
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:05,500
So bad.

1150
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:08,240
The eye is so bad.

1151
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,440
So fucking bad.

1152
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:16,920
I mean, I guess if you're like paying attention more.

1153
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:22,810
All right.

1154
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:26,030
Is that it?

1155
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:27,410
Anyone?

1156
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:34,190
I was like, okay, I have to aim down sight.

1157
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:35,710
All right, goodbye.

1158
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:39,270
Oh, I don't die from my own bomb.

1159
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:40,430
No, I'm dead.

1160
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:47,170
I'm dead.

1161
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:49,870
I guess if it's not just me, it would be better.

1162
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:51,290
I feel like the wall...

1163
00:48:51,290 --> 00:48:53,830
I guess they have to nerf the wall hack a little bit.

1164
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:54,550
Okay.

1165
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:56,270
Not...

1166
00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:57,170
Doki.

1167
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:01,710
Yes, nobody stole my identity.

1168
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:04,630
You can't be unlocked by completing matches.

1169
00:49:04,910 --> 00:49:05,430
Oh, cool.

1170
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:07,910
Do I get to pick?

1171
00:49:08,850 --> 00:49:10,190
Oh, I get to receive.

1172
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:11,530
Enemy heads are bigger.

1173
00:49:11,770 --> 00:49:12,870
Jesus Christ.

1174
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:14,170
What the fuck?

1175
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:15,250
Wait, what's the cat one?

1176
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:18,510
A fiery hound follows you by...

1177
00:49:18,510 --> 00:49:20,090
What are these?

1178
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:21,530
Okay.

1179
00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:22,410
Okay.

1180
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:22,870
Let's see.

1181
00:49:22,970 --> 00:49:24,310
Removes one target sight.

1182
00:49:24,350 --> 00:49:26,530
No healing for enemies.

1183
00:49:26,810 --> 00:49:28,130
Jesus Christ.

1184
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:30,570
Okay, let's see.

1185
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:33,110
Explodes on impact.

1186
00:49:33,350 --> 00:49:34,810
That seems very broken.

1187
00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:38,930
For four shards, that seems really broken.

1188
00:49:39,350 --> 00:49:39,590
All right.

1189
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:40,230
I like this.

1190
00:49:40,370 --> 00:49:41,410
Let's shoot teammates to heal.

1191
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:42,370
Gain double jump.

1192
00:49:42,930 --> 00:49:44,110
Enhance a random weapon.

1193
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:45,630
Releases flashbang.

1194
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:47,230
Diffuse time.

1195
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:48,070
Slowly lands.

1196
00:49:48,370 --> 00:49:49,510
Snowy landscape.

1197
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:50,730
Oh, I like this.

1198
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:51,970
That seems fun.

1199
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:57,810
Equip a turtle on your back to block bullets from behind.

1200
00:49:58,350 --> 00:50:01,330
No fucking back shots allowed.

1201
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:02,750
All right.

1202
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:03,290
Okay.

1203
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:04,450
We tried that one.

1204
00:50:04,890 --> 00:50:06,030
I don't know if this is good.

1205
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:09,270
I feel like that's more detrimental than good.

1206
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:11,970
What else?

1207
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:13,630
Iron hand.

1208
00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:15,090
Emergency evac.

1209
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:17,290
Exposes all enemies in sight.

1210
00:50:17,830 --> 00:50:18,490
Elbow shard.

1211
00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:19,250
Point screen.

1212
00:50:19,570 --> 00:50:20,370
Close court.

1213
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:21,610
Blows away.

1214
00:50:22,030 --> 00:50:23,090
That's fun.

1215
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:25,150
What the fuck is this?

1216
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:27,190
You can sleep to heal yours?

1217
00:50:27,210 --> 00:50:27,790
What the fuck?

1218
00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:29,090
What the fuck is that?

1219
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:31,790
All right, let me get- I realized I forgot to get my water.

1220
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:33,470
I'll be right back, chat.

1221
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:16,520
Guys, I forgot to bring my water.

1222
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:20,560
Like, some of these are like, oh my- some of these are like, scary.

1223
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:30,340
Yeah, it's a little scary, guys.

1224
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,220
All right, let's see.

1225
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:38,500
Let's see.

1226
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:39,520
Receive.

1227
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,080
Here's another gift.

1228
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:41,780
Check it out.

1229
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:42,440
What did I get?

1230
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,140
CDs are rewards.

1231
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:44,800
Oh, fuck.

1232
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:45,720
A battle pass.

1233
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,040
Whoa-wee!

1234
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:50,900
Unless you pay me, I'll never spend money on your game.

1235
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:53,120
All right, standard.

1236
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:55,920
I don't want- there's death match.

1237
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:57,760
Ranked.

1238
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:58,240
Outbreak.

1239
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,000
What's outbreak?

1240
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:02,280
Parasite's trident effect.

1241
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:04,680
Oh, this is like, survive- like, what is it called?

1242
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:07,400
The- What?

1243
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:09,200
That's a Gmod mode.

1244
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:10,960
Um...

1245
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,560
That's a famous Gmod mode.

1246
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:13,660
I don't remember what it's called.

1247
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:15,080
Infection.

1248
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:15,740
Yeah, yeah!

1249
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:16,580
Infection.

1250
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:18,760
Oh, they have infection, too.

1251
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,200
Oh, there's sniper death match.

1252
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:22,780
Oh my god.

1253
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:24,080
Wait, I still don't want to play this.

1254
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:26,680
I want to play- What's shard?

1255
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:32,960
Uh, use shard to make the rules engage in a bestest- Jesus, there's so many different rules.

1256
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,160
Oh, there's the 1v1.

1257
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:36,900
Okay, there's the 1v1.

1258
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,180
Is that Halo?

1259
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,520
I only know it from- I know it from, uh...

1260
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:43,340
Um, Gmod.

1261
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:45,060
I used to play- I won't play this one.

1262
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:46,920
I'll get absolutely destroyed.

1263
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:51,340
Training base, PVE.

1264
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:52,680
Oh wait, these are warning.

1265
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:55,300
Oh wait, war- Okay, let's do scrimmage while we wait.

1266
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,440
I won't get absolutely destroyed.

1267
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:58,200
Let's do it.

1268
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:02,320
You- you just- Oh my god, we cannot escape Marvel, right?

1269
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:06,180
Oh shit.

1270
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,400
We'll never escape.

1271
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:09,880
I was like, what?

1272
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:10,720
You yourself?

1273
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:12,580
That's a rival's map.

1274
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:15,820
Also, I upped the volume sound guy.

1275
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,000
What do you think now?

1276
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,200
Time for snipery.

1277
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,680
All right, let's see if I can do this.

1278
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:23,460
Um, does it really matter?

1279
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:26,960
High life?

1280
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:27,840
Whoa.

1281
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,480
Um, I don't know.

1282
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:31,180
We'll try.

1283
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:33,440
I don't know which one is an actual good weapon.

1284
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:39,200
Let's get absolutely destroyed, I guess.

1285
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,300
Wait, people are sniping?

1286
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:43,580
Oh my god.

1287
00:53:47,810 --> 00:53:48,590
Bro, okay.

1288
00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:49,630
These guys are too good.

1289
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:55,330
What the fuck?

1290
00:53:55,850 --> 00:53:57,210
You gotta collect?

1291
00:53:57,750 --> 00:53:58,090
Bro!

1292
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:03,740
Where are they?

1293
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:08,600
I can't- Okay.

1294
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:10,840
Okay.

1295
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:20,470
I'm like, I'm- oh, I don't like- maybe this gun is not it.

1296
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:25,470
Or maybe I'm just not headshotting, who knows.

1297
00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:27,830
What?!

1298
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:29,290
I'm getting destroyed!

1299
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:33,090
Jesus Christ, I'm getting absolutely destroyed.

1300
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:38,230
It's like a- it's like peeker's advantage.

1301
00:54:40,790 --> 00:54:41,270
What?!

1302
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:41,750
Where?!

1303
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:44,110
Okay, now I remember why I hate sniper mode, guys.

1304
00:54:49,890 --> 00:54:51,690
Are you serious?!

1305
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:52,610
Holy shit!

1306
00:54:54,970 --> 00:54:57,390
It's whoever has peeker's advantage!

1307
00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:02,110
Whoever sees the other one first, except for me.

1308
00:55:02,930 --> 00:55:04,170
Except for me, though.

1309
00:55:04,390 --> 00:55:10,410
It doesn't work on me, though, because I- It doesn't work on me, unfortunately.

1310
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:13,770
Because I can't headshot.

1311
00:55:16,550 --> 00:55:17,530
There we go.

1312
00:55:18,550 --> 00:55:20,330
I just can't headshot, guys.

1313
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:23,170
No!

1314
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:29,140
Wait, how does they heal?

1315
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:29,800
Do you see that?

1316
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:30,940
They heal themselves.

1317
00:55:36,590 --> 00:55:38,190
Fucking hell, that's not fair.

1318
00:55:39,150 --> 00:55:39,710
What?!

1319
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:40,630
I can't- oh!

1320
00:55:44,410 --> 00:55:45,890
That was a headshot!

1321
00:55:45,890 --> 00:55:46,490
What?!

1322
00:55:47,350 --> 00:55:48,370
That's bullshit.

1323
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:51,130
That was absolutely a headshot.

1324
00:55:54,270 --> 00:55:56,890
That was 100% a headshot.

1325
00:55:57,830 --> 00:55:59,250
Fuck me, I guess.

1326
00:55:59,930 --> 00:56:00,630
No head.

1327
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,300
Oh my god.

1328
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:07,560
Is this gun bad?

1329
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:08,740
I think- wait, I don't know.

1330
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:10,220
Am I using the wrong gun?

1331
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:11,600
Should I use this one?

1332
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:15,660
All right, let's see.

1333
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,040
Is this gun is better?

1334
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:18,140
Guys.

1335
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:21,800
Oh my god, I was using the wrong gun!

1336
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:26,580
Okay, okay, yeah.

1337
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:31,720
I was using the wrong gun.

1338
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:35,360
This is- yeah, yeah, this is the off!

1339
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:37,620
This is the off, guys!

1340
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:43,740
That makes sense now.

1341
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:45,880
No wonder!

1342
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:47,020
Guys!

1343
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:49,480
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

1344
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:53,580
Yeah, I was not using the right one.

1345
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:55,920
I was not using the off, guys.

1346
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:59,720
No, okay, that makes a lot more sense now.

1347
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:02,620
No wonder everybody was fucking one-shotting me.

1348
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:03,940
I was so confused.

1349
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:06,520
I'm not washed, guys!

1350
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,520
I was not washed.

1351
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:11,240
I was just using the wrong gun in general.

1352
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:20,040
I was using the fucking scout instead of the actual gun.

1353
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:22,260
I didn't know!

1354
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:24,000
I didn't know!

1355
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,680
Oh my god, I didn't see this person.

1356
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:32,320
Wait, everybody's playing like the- the healer, but you can't even use class abilities.

1357
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:34,200
Why are they all using them?

1358
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:37,520
Oh shit, okay.

1359
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:40,420
I was trying- oh my god, he got fucking knifed!

1360
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:43,280
Okay, now I'm actually getting kills though, and that makes me happy.

1361
00:57:43,790 --> 00:57:46,560
Guys, I'm- I'm happy because I'm actually getting kills now.

1362
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:52,120
Wait, that's fucking right.

1363
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:53,040
That's right!

1364
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:57,240
That's fucking right.

1365
00:57:58,100 --> 00:57:59,020
It's okay.

1366
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:02,200
I was sandbagging in the beginning, guys.

1367
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:03,400
I was sandbagging.

1368
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:07,220
Yes!

1369
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:07,960
We know now.

1370
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:08,620
We know.

1371
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:11,840
I was sandbagging, but now I know what to use.

1372
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:18,240
The guild authorizes you to lock in the key and say thank you for the super chat.

1373
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:19,580
Thank you, thank you.

1374
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:22,720
Guys, I was literally sandbagging, okay?

1375
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:24,660
Now that I know.

1376
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:28,720
Now that I know which one's the actual off gun.

1377
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:30,820
Look, I figured it out.

1378
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:32,840
I was like, how am I not?

1379
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:35,960
I was like, how the fuck am I not?

1380
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:36,640
Oh shit, nice.

1381
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:37,420
I can have stickers.

1382
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:39,660
What is this?

1383
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:42,340
Oh, I can put the stickers on my gun, right?

1384
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:45,340
Okay, I- I'm gonna redeem myself.

1385
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:49,320
Jesus, there's so many like cosmetics and everything.

1386
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:53,100
Um, wait, how do I- my- I don't care about that.

1387
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:54,040
I won't play.

1388
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:56,020
How do I play again?

1389
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:00,300
God, there's- God, lobby, arsenal.

1390
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:03,540
How do I play my- how do I play a video game?

1391
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:07,580
Which- there's so many.

1392
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:08,880
Which one is it?

1393
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:10,600
Wait, oh, there it is.

1394
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:12,020
Oh, there's the play button.

1395
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:12,560
I'm sorry.

1396
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:13,940
It was in a different font.

1397
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:15,020
I was so confused.

1398
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:17,900
Okay, guys, I have to do this again, guys.

1399
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:22,560
It was just weird.

1400
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:23,860
It was in a weird font.

1401
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:24,940
I got confused.

1402
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:27,560
I got- I got confused.

1403
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:29,400
It blends in.

1404
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:32,200
It blends in, chat.

1405
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:42,080
It's not like- it's not actually- it's not like intuitive at all.

1406
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:47,400
Okay, now that I know what- now that I know how to use the sniper rifle, this is it.

1407
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:48,660
I'm gonna redeem myself, guys.

1408
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:50,380
I'm gonna redeem myself right here.

1409
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:51,940
I swear to god.

1410
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:59,880
Now that I know- now that I know, this is the actual sniper that everyone uses.

1411
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:01,040
See?

1412
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:02,560
I told you.

1413
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:05,640
Oh, shit.

1414
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:09,720
Oh my god, he's fucking crazy!

1415
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:14,540
Guys, I figured it out, guys.

1416
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:18,540
Oh, Juice WRLD, you go, Juice WRLD.

1417
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:21,560
Somebody here.

1418
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:24,460
Somebody on this side.

1419
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:26,040
Wait, what?

1420
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:26,840
123?

1421
01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:29,140
There we go.

1422
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:30,360
There we go.

1423
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:31,900
See, look at that headshot now.

1424
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:33,040
Look at that.

1425
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,260
Look at that, guys.

1426
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:38,940
Headshot.

1427
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:41,740
Look at that quickscope headshot, too.

1428
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:43,660
That was crazy of me to do.

1429
01:00:48,470 --> 01:00:49,290
I'm gaming.

1430
01:00:50,590 --> 01:00:52,510
I just need like- oh.

1431
01:00:53,390 --> 01:00:55,310
Oh my god, 123!

1432
01:00:55,830 --> 01:00:56,770
He should be dead!

1433
01:00:57,170 --> 01:00:59,150
He should absolutely be dead!

1434
01:01:01,070 --> 01:01:01,790
123!

1435
01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:09,030
That guy should not be alive.

1436
01:01:11,110 --> 01:01:12,410
That's fucking right.

1437
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:14,550
Get out of here.

1438
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:19,530
No, I got crossed!

1439
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:22,790
That was a headshot!

1440
01:01:23,850 --> 01:01:26,970
That would have been a headshot if I didn't get crossed!

1441
01:01:28,470 --> 01:01:29,210
There we go.

1442
01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:30,170
Get out of here.

1443
01:01:31,830 --> 01:01:33,030
Get out- no!

1444
01:01:34,990 --> 01:01:36,490
There's too many footsteps.

1445
01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:40,450
I don't know this game enough to figure out where the head- where they're going.

1446
01:01:42,370 --> 01:01:43,230
Okay, nice.

1447
01:01:44,550 --> 01:01:47,530
There's way too many footsteps around me.

1448
01:01:49,550 --> 01:01:50,510
Oh, shit!

1449
01:01:51,390 --> 01:01:52,730
That's fucking right.

1450
01:01:52,890 --> 01:01:54,210
I told you!

1451
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:55,010
Oh, fuck!

1452
01:01:56,050 --> 01:01:57,730
I told you!

1453
01:01:59,510 --> 01:02:01,150
I told you!

1454
01:02:01,530 --> 01:02:05,410
Now that I figure- I told you I can play shooters.

1455
01:02:05,750 --> 01:02:07,370
I have the aim.

1456
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:08,930
I told you, guys.

1457
01:02:12,450 --> 01:02:16,330
When I have the aim, I'm unstoppable.

1458
01:02:16,630 --> 01:02:17,270
I'm 5 HP.

1459
01:02:17,270 --> 01:02:17,310
Oh, baby.

1460
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:21,050
Get shit on!

1461
01:02:22,180 --> 01:02:23,790
I still got it.

1462
01:02:24,550 --> 01:02:26,670
I still fucking got it.

1463
01:02:28,030 --> 01:02:29,770
That's fucking right, baby.

1464
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:32,770
That's fucking right.

1465
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:35,010
It don't matter.

1466
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:40,910
You fucking coward!

1467
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:42,670
You're such a coward!

1468
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:45,310
You're such a little bitch!

1469
01:02:45,310 --> 01:02:48,130
I just scared your baby.

1470
01:02:48,830 --> 01:02:51,890
You have to camp to kill me, you fucker.

1471
01:02:52,430 --> 01:02:53,770
You're so bad.

1472
01:02:53,850 --> 01:02:56,950
Imagine camping just to try and get a kill.

1473
01:03:00,470 --> 01:03:03,560
That's such a little bitch boy right there.

1474
01:03:05,410 --> 01:03:06,870
I see you there.

1475
01:03:10,170 --> 01:03:11,310
Be better.

1476
01:03:15,310 --> 01:03:17,990
Actually know how to play, bro.

1477
01:03:20,370 --> 01:03:21,190
I know.

1478
01:03:25,670 --> 01:03:27,030
That's a Q-Rate.

1479
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:28,390
I'm better than you.

1480
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:32,430
Jesus Christ, your honor.

1481
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:34,470
I know I'm better.

1482
01:03:37,450 --> 01:03:38,090
Redeemed.

1483
01:03:38,230 --> 01:03:39,450
That's a Q-Rate.

1484
01:03:41,110 --> 01:03:43,390
I know I'm better than you.

1485
01:03:43,390 --> 01:03:47,750
Now that I don't have a fucking scout and an AWP.

1486
01:03:49,070 --> 01:03:49,690
No!

1487
01:03:50,150 --> 01:03:51,830
I got shot in the back!

1488
01:03:51,930 --> 01:03:52,670
Who shot me?

1489
01:03:53,390 --> 01:03:54,610
Who's that whore?

1490
01:03:57,190 --> 01:03:58,530
Who are you?

1491
01:03:59,430 --> 01:04:00,850
You know you're bad.

1492
01:04:02,450 --> 01:04:05,150
You have to backshot me to kill me.

1493
01:04:06,490 --> 01:04:09,110
Oh my god, there you go.

1494
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:09,830
I shot your leg.

1495
01:04:10,090 --> 01:04:10,970
I'll take that.

1496
01:04:14,210 --> 01:04:15,870
I'll take that leg shot.

1497
01:04:16,030 --> 01:04:17,450
Bro, that's fucked.

1498
01:04:17,550 --> 01:04:19,130
That's actual fuck.

1499
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:20,970
He got camped so hard there.

1500
01:04:21,850 --> 01:04:22,570
No,

1501
01:04:26,670 --> 01:04:27,110
what?

1502
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:30,090
I keep getting backshot.

1503
01:04:32,470 --> 01:04:33,530
That's messed up.

1504
01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:34,850
Yeah, we did it.

1505
01:04:35,030 --> 01:04:35,750
Yippee!

1506
01:04:36,290 --> 01:04:37,190
That's right.

1507
01:04:37,890 --> 01:04:38,970
Top fragger.

1508
01:04:39,170 --> 01:04:40,150
That's me.

1509
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:42,470
Wait, I'm not even the highlight?

1510
01:04:42,470 --> 01:04:43,570
I got a

1511
01:04:46,670 --> 01:04:47,090
fuck.

1512
01:04:47,470 --> 01:04:49,930
My kills are so much cooler.

1513
01:04:53,630 --> 01:04:56,770
My kills are so much cooler than that.

1514
01:04:57,090 --> 01:04:58,970
I can't believe it.

1515
01:04:59,050 --> 01:05:00,290
That was so lame.

1516
01:05:00,710 --> 01:05:01,910
That was so lame.

1517
01:05:02,030 --> 01:05:04,550
I literally got like four headshots in a row.

1518
01:05:09,630 --> 01:05:10,990
All right.

1519
01:05:11,850 --> 01:05:12,970
See you guys.

1520
01:05:13,110 --> 01:05:14,450
I told you I'm not washed.

1521
01:05:14,510 --> 01:05:15,290
Look at that.

1522
01:05:15,570 --> 01:05:16,890
Look at that chat.

1523
01:05:17,010 --> 01:05:18,170
I told you.

1524
01:05:19,590 --> 01:05:21,230
The W and W.

1525
01:05:21,270 --> 01:05:22,590
No, what do you mean?

1526
01:05:23,450 --> 01:05:26,110
I literally carried so hard.

1527
01:05:27,530 --> 01:05:28,990
Thank you for the super chat.

1528
01:05:29,110 --> 01:05:29,470
Thank you.

1529
01:05:29,530 --> 01:05:29,930
Thank you.

1530
01:05:29,930 --> 01:05:30,210
Come on.

1531
01:05:30,270 --> 01:05:31,790
I got a no scope too.

1532
01:05:32,050 --> 01:05:33,790
I got a no scope.

1533
01:05:34,170 --> 01:05:36,110
Um, no scope headshot.

1534
01:05:36,230 --> 01:05:37,570
Like come on.

1535
01:05:37,750 --> 01:05:40,170
I deserve so much more.

1536
01:05:40,650 --> 01:05:40,930
I...

1537
01:05:42,410 --> 01:05:45,450
I missed the toxic gamer ASMR.

1538
01:05:48,470 --> 01:05:51,110
All right, let's see.

1539
01:05:52,950 --> 01:05:54,970
Oh, wait, there's no W in Doki Bird.

1540
01:05:55,110 --> 01:05:55,730
Wait, you're right.

1541
01:05:56,730 --> 01:06:00,430
There's no W in Doki Bird.

1542
01:06:00,910 --> 01:06:02,530
All right, completing matches.

1543
01:06:02,650 --> 01:06:03,510
So I'm not washed.

1544
01:06:03,670 --> 01:06:04,250
Oh my god.

1545
01:06:04,310 --> 01:06:04,910
You're sorry guys.

1546
01:06:04,970 --> 01:06:06,010
I can't spell either.

1547
01:06:06,710 --> 01:06:07,770
Oh my god.

1548
01:06:07,810 --> 01:06:08,090
Okay.

1549
01:06:08,810 --> 01:06:09,370
How do I?

1550
01:06:09,550 --> 01:06:10,850
I like the...

1551
01:06:10,930 --> 01:06:12,130
How do I?

1552
01:06:12,810 --> 01:06:13,550
Oh my gosh.

1553
01:06:13,650 --> 01:06:14,790
I'm so confused.

1554
01:06:15,090 --> 01:06:15,730
I'm so...

1555
01:06:16,770 --> 01:06:17,550
Card sleeve.

1556
01:06:17,710 --> 01:06:19,010
Oh, I can like put cards...

1557
01:06:19,990 --> 01:06:22,010
card sleeves on my cards?

1558
01:06:24,270 --> 01:06:27,150
Not washed, still toxic, broken bot.

1559
01:06:27,270 --> 01:06:28,290
Thank you for the super chat.

1560
01:06:28,370 --> 01:06:28,670
Thank you.

1561
01:06:28,730 --> 01:06:29,430
Thank you.

1562
01:06:29,810 --> 01:06:31,030
All right now...

1563
01:06:31,030 --> 01:06:33,730
Okay, now that I feel warmed up now, I think I can...

1564
01:06:34,330 --> 01:06:36,470
I think I can do a standard game mode.

1565
01:06:37,010 --> 01:06:38,150
I think I can do it.

1566
01:06:38,470 --> 01:06:42,310
I'm gonna... I'm gonna get beat up, but like I think I can do it.

1567
01:06:44,150 --> 01:06:45,130
There we go.

1568
01:06:45,910 --> 01:06:47,470
There is no L in Doki.

1569
01:06:49,090 --> 01:06:50,990
Thank you for the super chat.

1570
01:06:51,110 --> 01:06:51,390
Thank you.

1571
01:06:51,410 --> 01:06:52,110
Thank you.

1572
01:06:53,070 --> 01:06:56,050
I like the non-tactical shooter of this game so far.

1573
01:06:58,590 --> 01:06:59,790
Wait, I'm spectating?

1574
01:07:00,010 --> 01:07:01,390
Am I like... Oh my god.

1575
01:07:01,430 --> 01:07:02,490
Am I fucking filling?

1576
01:07:02,730 --> 01:07:03,550
Am I filling?

1577
01:07:03,870 --> 01:07:04,890
God damn it.

1578
01:07:05,830 --> 01:07:07,210
Why am I always a filler?

1579
01:07:07,670 --> 01:07:08,750
Half a minute to go.

1580
01:07:09,030 --> 01:07:09,850
What's going on?

1581
01:07:09,930 --> 01:07:11,170
Is he the only one alive?

1582
01:07:13,770 --> 01:07:14,430
Wait, what?

1583
01:07:15,810 --> 01:07:19,350
What the fuck is going on in my team?

1584
01:07:19,670 --> 01:07:20,730
Oh my god.

1585
01:07:20,790 --> 01:07:22,710
Why do I have to fill for this?

1586
01:07:23,270 --> 01:07:23,410
Why?

1587
01:07:25,010 --> 01:07:25,530
No!

1588
01:07:28,970 --> 01:07:30,010
All right.

1589
01:07:30,930 --> 01:07:32,890
Click on add to inject and activate.

1590
01:07:33,210 --> 01:07:35,010
Like or dislike to let your team know what you want.

1591
01:07:35,110 --> 01:07:36,210
Click the refresh button.

1592
01:07:36,410 --> 01:07:37,370
Okay, um...

1593
01:07:40,810 --> 01:07:41,330
Sure.

1594
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:48,980
Um...

1595
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:50,280
Sure.

1596
01:07:50,540 --> 01:07:51,860
I don't know what I'm doing.

1597
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:53,680
Oh, I like that character.

1598
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:56,660
Okay, let's try this.

1599
01:08:01,090 --> 01:08:01,610
Uh...

1600
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:02,190
Sure.

1601
01:08:02,190 --> 01:08:03,290
Sure.

1602
01:08:03,390 --> 01:08:04,870
All right.

1603
01:08:06,510 --> 01:08:09,390
I don't know if my... What is this?

1604
01:08:11,770 --> 01:08:12,890
The fuck?

1605
01:08:14,630 --> 01:08:15,990
What the fuck?

1606
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:16,590
Where am I?

1607
01:08:16,710 --> 01:08:17,450
Okay, I'm B.

1608
01:08:18,290 --> 01:08:19,850
Oh, I don't know these maps.

1609
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:29,020
Okay, going rotating the A, doing the tactical shooter, part of the tactical shooter.

1610
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:41,950
Oh my god.

1611
01:08:43,110 --> 01:08:44,310
Oh my god.

1612
01:08:44,310 --> 01:08:44,690
Okay.

1613
01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:49,390
Okay.

1614
01:08:54,460 --> 01:08:55,220
No!

1615
01:08:55,420 --> 01:08:56,120
What?

1616
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:57,940
He had a sniper?

1617
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:00,860
God damn it.

1618
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:04,120
He had a fucking... Oh my god.

1619
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:09,740
I didn't... I was like, how did he kill me that fast?

1620
01:09:09,780 --> 01:09:10,520
That fucker.

1621
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:12,240
That fucker.

1622
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:15,800
Look, I literally was filling.

1623
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:17,780
Guys, I had to fill.

1624
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:19,440
I had four people.

1625
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:22,080
One of them wasn't even... I had to fill, guys.

1626
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:23,380
That doesn't count.

1627
01:09:23,780 --> 01:09:27,440
I... Guys, I'm... I had the most healing on myself.

1628
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:33,960
I got... I got a fucking... I like came in.

1629
01:09:34,060 --> 01:09:35,160
I was like, okay, guys.

1630
01:09:35,340 --> 01:09:36,660
I got the most healing.

1631
01:09:36,820 --> 01:09:38,100
What did you do?

1632
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:39,880
You had four...

1633
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:42,060
How'd you have less damage than me?

1634
01:09:42,340 --> 01:09:45,380
You played the entire four games.

1635
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:46,120
How?

1636
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:47,240
Okay.

1637
01:09:47,380 --> 01:09:48,100
Okay, never mind.

1638
01:09:48,460 --> 01:09:52,580
You played four games and you're only 20 points below me?

1639
01:09:55,220 --> 01:10:00,740
How do you play four matches and be 20 points below me in damage?

1640
01:10:01,340 --> 01:10:03,100
Like, how is that possible?

1641
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:09,820
That's actually crazy.

1642
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:11,660
That guy should definitely uninstall.

1643
01:10:12,740 --> 01:10:15,040
FPS games are not for him.

1644
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:19,340
Okay, can I actually play the game now?

1645
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:21,040
Tab, woman slayer.

1646
01:10:28,030 --> 01:10:33,690
All right, the reason the last person left.

1647
01:10:35,790 --> 01:10:37,870
All right, take your time.

1648
01:10:38,710 --> 01:10:42,790
Spawn self grass on all weapons for free once.

1649
01:10:42,950 --> 01:10:43,750
Bro, I like that.

1650
01:10:43,830 --> 01:10:44,830
Do we have enough points?

1651
01:10:45,970 --> 01:10:47,850
I want all weapons to be free.

1652
01:10:50,370 --> 01:10:50,930
Yay!

1653
01:10:55,410 --> 01:10:55,970
Explosive.

1654
01:10:56,050 --> 01:10:58,070
Okay, I want to play as her.

1655
01:10:59,010 --> 01:11:01,930
And then I get my AK and this.

1656
01:11:02,930 --> 01:11:04,570
All right, I'm good.

1657
01:11:05,750 --> 01:11:06,230
Okay.

1658
01:11:06,350 --> 01:11:08,650
Okay, I think the turret shit is fucking stupid.

1659
01:11:09,210 --> 01:11:10,770
Okay, let me see.

1660
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:12,450
How do I- where do I put my turret?

1661
01:11:13,150 --> 01:11:14,750
I guess I'll put one here.

1662
01:11:15,150 --> 01:11:17,990
Bro, I don't- I don't know how to do this turret shit, man.

1663
01:11:18,730 --> 01:11:25,290
Like, I don't- I don't know how to do this turret shit, guys.

1664
01:11:32,170 --> 01:11:33,790
What am I looking at anyway?

1665
01:11:35,610 --> 01:11:37,050
What do I look at?

1666
01:11:39,850 --> 01:11:41,350
Jesus Christ, okay.

1667
01:11:41,670 --> 01:11:44,710
Oh my god, am I- okay.

1668
01:11:48,290 --> 01:11:49,070
Oh, fuck.

1669
01:11:50,290 --> 01:11:50,610
Q.

1670
01:11:52,270 --> 01:11:53,370
Wait, we did it.

1671
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:55,270
We did it.

1672
01:11:56,050 --> 01:11:57,510
I was trying to put a wall.

1673
01:11:57,890 --> 01:11:59,330
I wanted to put a wall.

1674
01:12:00,130 --> 01:12:02,290
I was like, what- what- what is this tornado?

1675
01:12:03,010 --> 01:12:04,010
What is- oh.

1676
01:12:04,010 --> 01:12:04,610
Oh.

1677
01:12:06,050 --> 01:12:07,610
The curse of Ra.

1678
01:12:07,770 --> 01:12:09,030
I was so confused.

1679
01:12:09,150 --> 01:12:15,190
I was like, what is this tornado in my- take off your health bar, swapping health with your turret, shoot enemies.

1680
01:12:15,390 --> 01:12:16,430
Yeah, let's just get that.

1681
01:12:17,010 --> 01:12:18,050
That seems good.

1682
01:12:18,130 --> 01:12:18,670
Do we have enough?

1683
01:12:18,770 --> 01:12:20,650
Mr. Sick, I see you have two shards.

1684
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:21,890
Put that fucker in.

1685
01:12:22,830 --> 01:12:23,750
Okay, nice.

1686
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:27,050
Cure shot.

1687
01:12:27,190 --> 01:12:29,050
Okay, nice.

1688
01:12:32,150 --> 01:12:32,610
Uh...

1689
01:12:34,010 --> 01:12:36,170
Okay, we can heal ourselves now.

1690
01:12:37,990 --> 01:12:40,230
Mr. Si- dude, how?

1691
01:12:40,510 --> 01:12:41,850
Why is it my team?

1692
01:12:42,390 --> 01:12:43,770
How is that possible?

1693
01:12:46,050 --> 01:12:46,650
Um...

1694
01:12:46,650 --> 01:12:48,230
I don't fucking know.

1695
01:12:48,370 --> 01:12:49,650
I'm so confused.

1696
01:12:49,750 --> 01:12:50,950
I'll put the turret here.

1697
01:12:51,210 --> 01:12:53,730
And then another turret here.

1698
01:12:54,230 --> 01:12:56,650
And then I'll- I'll put...

1699
01:13:00,330 --> 01:13:01,970
I feel like I hear somebody here.

1700
01:13:01,970 --> 01:13:05,650
I definitely hear someone here.

1701
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:10,400
Okay.

1702
01:13:16,620 --> 01:13:17,580
All right.

1703
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:19,600
5v3.

1704
01:13:21,820 --> 01:13:23,160
Where do I walk?

1705
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:28,280
There's no walk in this game.

1706
01:13:32,820 --> 01:13:34,060
Where are they?

1707
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:38,120
Can I burst through this wall?

1708
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:38,600
No.

1709
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:41,540
Wait, maybe I- oh, I can heal my Ronin.

1710
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:44,720
There you go, you're full HP.

1711
01:13:44,940 --> 01:13:46,100
Don't need to thank me.

1712
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:47,300
Oh, fuck.

1713
01:13:47,380 --> 01:13:49,500
We gotta- they're at A site.

1714
01:13:54,010 --> 01:13:55,410
All right, I'm heading to A.

1715
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:01,000
I'm heading to A and see if I'll die.

1716
01:14:03,620 --> 01:14:05,740
All right, guys, you believe in me?

1717
01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:07,140
Because I don't.

1718
01:14:14,930 --> 01:14:16,150
Okay, I do actually.

1719
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:22,860
No, I have to reload!

1720
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:24,300
Get the turret!

1721
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:28,160
There you go, I had to reload.

1722
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:32,160
I didn't even see- wait, you can put turrets on the walls?

1723
01:14:33,660 --> 01:14:35,980
Can I change my outfit?

1724
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:39,060
Wait, the turrets slow you down.

1725
01:14:40,380 --> 01:14:43,660
I didn't realize the turrets could slow you down.

1726
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:44,580
That's fucked.

1727
01:14:45,420 --> 01:14:47,440
That launches projectiles?

1728
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:49,660
Deploy two charge bots on your team?

1729
01:14:49,700 --> 01:14:50,780
I want two charge bots.

1730
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:52,720
You just need one more- woman slayer!

1731
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:55,360
I know you have two points, woman slayer!

1732
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:56,020
Nice.

1733
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:56,700
There you go.

1734
01:14:57,060 --> 01:14:57,500
There you go.

1735
01:14:57,580 --> 01:14:58,360
We're fine now.

1736
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:03,080
There you go.

1737
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:05,400
Thank god.

1738
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:08,680
Now I have- Now it's like- it's like what?

1739
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:10,860
It's like how many players?

1740
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:13,900
It's like 7v2 now?

1741
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:14,600
Let's go.

1742
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:17,600
7v2!

1743
01:15:17,780 --> 01:15:19,700
Bro, that's so fucked.

1744
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:22,380
Imagine having a 7v2, that shit.

1745
01:15:22,940 --> 01:15:25,700
Oh my god, you can put it against the wall!

1746
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:27,520
That's so fucked!

1747
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:27,900
Okay.

1748
01:15:28,660 --> 01:15:31,220
What if I just put like a one here?

1749
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:33,840
Like that.

1750
01:15:36,180 --> 01:15:37,760
Bro, that's crazy broken.

1751
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:38,640
Nice.

1752
01:15:43,700 --> 01:15:44,980
Oh wait, he's killing everybody.

1753
01:15:45,220 --> 01:15:45,920
Let's go.

1754
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:51,300
How do I- can I- I feel like if I drop down there, I'm gonna die.

1755
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:54,060
Oh, we did it.

1756
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:54,540
We won.

1757
01:15:55,780 --> 01:15:57,820
I can put them on a ceiling too?

1758
01:15:58,520 --> 01:15:59,520
Wait, really?

1759
01:15:59,940 --> 01:16:02,080
Bro, okay, this guy seems fucking broken.

1760
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:04,980
Now I'm sitting right in front of him.

1761
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:09,180
0.5 seconds after the light turns green.

1762
01:16:09,340 --> 01:16:11,160
Kira, thank you for the super chat.

1763
01:16:11,380 --> 01:16:11,780
Thank you.

1764
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:12,720
Thank you.

1765
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:17,320
Okay, now that- wait, are we still going?

1766
01:16:18,260 --> 01:16:19,520
Oh, now we're attack.

1767
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:20,500
Wait, how much is this?

1768
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:23,860
The best of- oh, it's best of- oh, it's all the way to four.

1769
01:16:23,980 --> 01:16:24,260
Okay.

1770
01:16:26,220 --> 01:16:29,660
Uh, plant itself, double shard points, gain this round.

1771
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:31,620
Mr. Sick!

1772
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:32,960
Rodan!

1773
01:16:33,580 --> 01:16:34,620
Oh my god.

1774
01:16:34,740 --> 01:16:36,120
Oh, oh, we can have everything.

1775
01:16:36,260 --> 01:16:36,680
Let's go.

1776
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:38,140
Let's just- fuck it.

1777
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:42,100
Just have everything, I guess.

1778
01:16:44,220 --> 01:16:46,980
All right, so what were ours again?

1779
01:16:47,260 --> 01:16:50,040
We have throw the plant and invest in the future.

1780
01:16:50,220 --> 01:16:51,220
Frozen wasteland.

1781
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:52,480
Oh, it's gonna be slippery.

1782
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:53,520
Wait, how do I slide?

1783
01:16:56,640 --> 01:17:00,380
Oh, I have to- Oh, I have to do that.

1784
01:17:01,940 --> 01:17:02,740
Okay.

1785
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:05,900
I have to jump.

1786
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:20,800
Okay.

1787
01:17:23,940 --> 01:17:25,560
The fuck are all these?

1788
01:17:28,820 --> 01:17:29,820
You're not real.

1789
01:17:30,380 --> 01:17:32,320
There's no way you're real.

1790
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:40,440
It's just like my- It's just like my tools!

1791
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:52,460
I have - Who the fuck has destroyed my drones?

1792
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:58,060
It's just like what's going- No, my U2!

1793
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:01,920
That's crazy.

1794
01:18:02,460 --> 01:18:04,520
That's actually crazy.

1795
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:06,440
Holy fuck.

1796
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:11,040
Baby's first tactical shooters.

1797
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:13,900
He was raising the kids.

1798
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:16,500
How could you do that to him?

1799
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:20,040
He was trying- I'll do one more of the normal one.

1800
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:21,980
Not my robot!

1801
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:29,340
He was devastated.

1802
01:18:30,460 --> 01:18:33,520
He was so- No, my first game was a real person.

1803
01:18:34,060 --> 01:18:37,080
My first game and what I filled were real people.

1804
01:18:37,220 --> 01:18:39,520
I refuse to believe they were not real.

1805
01:18:39,860 --> 01:18:43,420
Like that guy hit a fucking headshot on me insta.

1806
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:51,000
When I filled that game, I knew they were real.

1807
01:18:59,220 --> 01:19:01,400
Bots with aimbot.

1808
01:19:02,180 --> 01:19:03,540
To lay an egg?

1809
01:19:03,620 --> 01:19:06,000
That can't be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

1810
01:19:06,260 --> 01:19:07,060
We don't wait.

1811
01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:08,620
Technically we can.

1812
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:11,280
What fucking cowards.

1813
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:13,700
What the fucking cowards.

1814
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:18,460
Oh my god, what the fuck is that card?

1815
01:19:21,140 --> 01:19:23,900
Actually, what the fuck was that card?

1816
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:25,260
Do I have enough?

1817
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:27,780
Do I always have enough to buy all my stuff?

1818
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:32,360
I'm not even gonna do eco.

1819
01:19:35,660 --> 01:19:36,860
Okay, we'll go.

1820
01:19:37,780 --> 01:19:38,440
Let's go, dear.

1821
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:41,980
Toki hits Laura Acker.

1822
01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:45,000
Like, what the fuck is that?

1823
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:50,560
I don't know.

1824
01:19:52,580 --> 01:19:53,380
I don't know.

1825
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:53,660
Are

1826
01:19:57,330 --> 01:19:59,910
they all going?

1827
01:20:00,230 --> 01:20:01,510
Oh, I guess they're all going.

1828
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:08,300
All right, I'm just running.

1829
01:20:08,620 --> 01:20:10,660
What's the worst that could happen, I guess?

1830
01:20:31,930 --> 01:20:32,330
Okay.

1831
01:20:35,510 --> 01:20:36,330
There's nobody.

1832
01:20:36,550 --> 01:20:37,850
Wait, there could be.

1833
01:20:37,950 --> 01:20:38,370
They're planning.

1834
01:20:38,830 --> 01:20:39,910
Wait, they're not?

1835
01:20:41,230 --> 01:20:42,870
No, they can't be there.

1836
01:20:42,970 --> 01:20:43,550
Yeah, they're planning.

1837
01:20:53,790 --> 01:20:54,390
No!

1838
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:56,490
How much did I do?

1839
01:20:57,010 --> 01:20:58,670
Oh, I did 35.

1840
01:21:02,570 --> 01:21:03,510
Oh my god.

1841
01:21:03,510 --> 01:21:04,310
Okay, that guy.

1842
01:21:04,410 --> 01:21:06,610
That guy, you cannot tell me that's a bot.

1843
01:21:06,930 --> 01:21:09,270
That guy is 100% real.

1844
01:21:09,830 --> 01:21:12,870
That was a real guy.

1845
01:21:15,730 --> 01:21:19,750
The way he fucking jiggled that was a real person.

1846
01:21:19,970 --> 01:21:21,530
I refuse to believe.

1847
01:21:22,650 --> 01:21:24,230
That's a real guy.

1848
01:21:25,110 --> 01:21:26,950
I don't think you can defuse in time.

1849
01:21:27,470 --> 01:21:28,510
There's no way.

1850
01:21:28,650 --> 01:21:28,930
Yeah.

1851
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:30,050
There was no way.

1852
01:21:33,270 --> 01:21:34,930
I failed being tactical.

1853
01:21:35,130 --> 01:21:37,090
No, I am never a tactical person.

1854
01:21:38,830 --> 01:21:40,570
Like, bro, look at that!

1855
01:21:41,850 --> 01:21:42,890
That's not...

1856
01:21:42,890 --> 01:21:44,090
He's not fake.

1857
01:21:44,450 --> 01:21:45,990
He's real as hell.

1858
01:21:48,870 --> 01:21:49,610
All right.

1859
01:21:49,890 --> 01:21:50,870
How many points do I have?

1860
01:21:50,930 --> 01:21:51,610
2.6.

1861
01:21:51,710 --> 01:21:51,990
Okay.

1862
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:55,270
I am...

1863
01:21:55,270 --> 01:21:55,950
Wait, what?

1864
01:21:56,050 --> 01:21:56,370
Really?

1865
01:21:56,490 --> 01:21:58,270
Is that actually a good powerup?

1866
01:22:00,370 --> 01:22:01,330
I mean, I'll do that.

1867
01:22:02,870 --> 01:22:04,490
Wait, we can double it?

1868
01:22:05,530 --> 01:22:06,510
Oh, no.

1869
01:22:08,450 --> 01:22:09,490
Oh, no.

1870
01:22:12,630 --> 01:22:13,450
All right.

1871
01:22:14,050 --> 01:22:15,910
I guess I'll keep going here.

1872
01:22:17,010 --> 01:22:20,270
I don't know if, like, the snow one is actually good.

1873
01:22:27,430 --> 01:22:28,570
I'll put it here.

1874
01:22:28,870 --> 01:22:30,710
I don't fucking know, guys.

1875
01:22:31,270 --> 01:22:32,730
And then...

1876
01:22:32,730 --> 01:22:34,150
I build my wall.

1877
01:22:38,190 --> 01:22:39,350
What the fuck?

1878
01:22:40,530 --> 01:22:40,990
Okay.

1879
01:22:41,590 --> 01:22:42,770
I guess I rotate.

1880
01:22:43,850 --> 01:22:45,050
I'll rotate back.

1881
01:22:46,790 --> 01:22:48,930
Okay, they're, like, not tactical, too.

1882
01:22:48,970 --> 01:22:50,470
You can't say I'm not tactical.

1883
01:22:50,630 --> 01:22:52,110
Look at how my team's playing.

1884
01:22:54,950 --> 01:22:56,870
That is not tactical at all.

1885
01:22:56,890 --> 01:22:59,490
I refuse to believe my team is tactical here.

1886
01:23:00,450 --> 01:23:01,250
I

1887
01:23:10,970 --> 01:23:13,090
forgot there's fucking no backshots!

1888
01:23:13,590 --> 01:23:14,690
The stupid turtle!

1889
01:23:17,870 --> 01:23:19,750
The stupid fucking turtle!

1890
01:23:29,940 --> 01:23:31,260
Goddamn turtle.

1891
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:35,320
There we go.

1892
01:23:35,380 --> 01:23:35,900
I got one.

1893
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,380
I see him.

1894
01:23:44,670 --> 01:23:45,770
Is he gonna rotate?

1895
01:23:46,290 --> 01:23:47,090
He might rotate.

1896
01:23:47,450 --> 01:23:48,330
I'm backing up.

1897
01:23:50,790 --> 01:23:53,330
I know my tactical shooters.

1898
01:23:56,770 --> 01:23:58,150
Do I have my bomb?

1899
01:23:58,970 --> 01:24:00,970
Wait, he's not rotating?

1900
01:24:03,910 --> 01:24:06,950
Oh my god, he actually pushed it?

1901
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:08,970
Oh my god, he crazy!

1902
01:24:09,790 --> 01:24:10,790
He's fucking crazy!

1903
01:24:14,110 --> 01:24:16,050
That guy's insane!

1904
01:24:16,510 --> 01:24:18,230
Why the fuck would you push that?

1905
01:24:19,070 --> 01:24:19,830
Fuck it.

1906
01:24:23,630 --> 01:24:24,230
Okay.

1907
01:24:24,230 --> 01:24:25,650
She in fact did not know her.

1908
01:24:26,050 --> 01:24:27,690
I- usually you rotate!

1909
01:24:28,110 --> 01:24:28,730
I don't know!

1910
01:24:30,510 --> 01:24:32,310
Okay, now I can jump.

1911
01:24:34,690 --> 01:24:39,890
If I don't- Guys, I don't know- apparently I don't know my tactical shooters, guys.

1912
01:24:43,870 --> 01:24:47,650
I don't- guys, apparently I just did not.

1913
01:24:47,650 --> 01:24:48,790
Who would've thought?

1914
01:24:49,230 --> 01:24:51,890
I didn't know my tactical shooters.

1915
01:24:53,350 --> 01:24:54,310
Guys, I don't know.

1916
01:24:54,390 --> 01:24:57,030
I don't know if what I'm doing is correct.

1917
01:24:58,990 --> 01:24:59,970
Wait, okay.

1918
01:25:01,350 --> 01:25:02,210
Put it here.

1919
01:25:05,910 --> 01:25:07,550
Okay, are they still there?

1920
01:25:08,870 --> 01:25:11,830
Holy shit, they're still trying to play there.

1921
01:25:12,930 --> 01:25:14,770
Alright, I'm coming over, guys.

1922
01:25:14,930 --> 01:25:16,050
I'm here to help.

1923
01:25:21,020 --> 01:25:22,800
I'm here to help.

1924
01:25:23,340 --> 01:25:24,580
Use my Q?

1925
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:26,860
Alright, I'm gunna use my Q right here.

1926
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:29,360
Let's go.

1927
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:33,800
Wait,

1928
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:37,360
what?

1929
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:42,380
What the fuck is going on?

1930
01:25:43,220 --> 01:25:45,360
Am I gunna die doing this?

1931
01:25:51,970 --> 01:25:52,990
He's over here.

1932
01:25:53,110 --> 01:25:54,610
Guys, I need to get out.

1933
01:25:55,310 --> 01:25:57,190
I don't feel safe doing that.

1934
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:02,300
Where is he?

1935
01:26:06,780 --> 01:26:08,100
Okay, there he is.

1936
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:12,020
All right, I was like, where's that one enemy left?

1937
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:13,580
Go back.

1938
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:16,240
Okay, I was like, where?

1939
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:22,060
What the fuck did he do?

1940
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:24,180
Wait, what?

1941
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:28,600
What is that ability?

1942
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:31,660
What the fuck?

1943
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:36,240
It's like fucking Junkrat.

1944
01:26:38,540 --> 01:26:41,520
Uh, better attack.

1945
01:26:41,780 --> 01:26:44,080
Sure, let's do that.

1946
01:26:49,060 --> 01:26:51,180
All right, I'm figuring it out, guys.

1947
01:26:51,340 --> 01:26:54,220
Wait, guys, why did we not work together?

1948
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:59,100
We didn't work together there.

1949
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:03,100
All right, you guys do that, I flank.

1950
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:04,700
Surely, it'll be okay.

1951
01:27:06,860 --> 01:27:09,620
Okay, wait, I got an idea.

1952
01:27:10,740 --> 01:27:12,280
We'll have to do this in spawn, though.

1953
01:27:13,060 --> 01:27:14,450
Wait, actually, um...

1954
01:27:15,770 --> 01:27:16,790
There we go.

1955
01:27:16,950 --> 01:27:18,450
Don't worry, guys.

1956
01:27:25,090 --> 01:27:25,690
Okay,

1957
01:27:29,810 --> 01:27:31,530
okay, we know where they are now.

1958
01:27:34,270 --> 01:27:35,730
I don't know how to walk.

1959
01:27:46,140 --> 01:27:49,960
My location got exposed, which is not the best.

1960
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:00,700
Oh, there's people flanking.

1961
01:28:14,150 --> 01:28:14,790
What?

1962
01:28:14,870 --> 01:28:15,950
I was distracted.

1963
01:28:16,110 --> 01:28:16,970
Let's go.

1964
01:28:19,130 --> 01:28:20,290
It's fine.

1965
01:28:20,610 --> 01:28:23,730
Literally, three people pushed me for some reason.

1966
01:28:25,350 --> 01:28:26,510
It's fine.

1967
01:28:26,610 --> 01:28:27,510
I'll take that.

1968
01:28:28,090 --> 01:28:31,530
I'll take being a distraction, guys.

1969
01:28:31,650 --> 01:28:32,850
I'm okay with that.

1970
01:28:32,850 --> 01:28:35,690
I'm okay with that.

1971
01:28:39,030 --> 01:28:42,330
How the fuck do I sleep to heal myself?

1972
01:28:42,910 --> 01:28:44,110
How the fuck?

1973
01:28:44,910 --> 01:28:45,490
You know what?

1974
01:28:45,650 --> 01:28:47,610
What if I- I want to chain, you know what?

1975
01:28:47,630 --> 01:28:47,930
Fuck it.

1976
01:28:47,990 --> 01:28:48,370
Let's go.

1977
01:28:49,810 --> 01:28:51,550
It's my turn to snipe.

1978
01:28:52,230 --> 01:28:52,670
All right.

1979
01:28:55,450 --> 01:28:57,130
All right, let's see how this goes.

1980
01:28:57,470 --> 01:29:01,350
How does one- exactly, how does- oh shit, they have a big head.

1981
01:29:01,350 --> 01:29:01,950
Oh, it's Z.

1982
01:29:02,290 --> 01:29:02,830
It's Z.

1983
01:29:03,570 --> 01:29:06,050
Guys, oh my god, guys.

1984
01:29:06,430 --> 01:29:07,550
Guys, I don't know.

1985
01:29:07,970 --> 01:29:09,290
I don't know, guys.

1986
01:29:09,450 --> 01:29:11,190
Our heads are pretty big.

1987
01:29:11,890 --> 01:29:12,270
God.

1988
01:29:14,570 --> 01:29:17,190
Our heads are pretty big.

1989
01:29:17,270 --> 01:29:18,870
I don't know about sniping this.

1990
01:29:19,170 --> 01:29:20,350
I don't know.

1991
01:29:22,590 --> 01:29:26,290
I'm a little worried about our fucking heads right now.

1992
01:29:32,840 --> 01:29:33,920
Oh no.

1993
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:34,020
Oh no.

1994
01:29:39,220 --> 01:29:40,350
Jesus Christ.

1995
01:29:44,650 --> 01:29:45,120
Okay.

1996
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:54,390
I don't know where they are.

1997
01:30:05,590 --> 01:30:06,870
Oh, what?

1998
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:23,840
Oh, they know I'm here.

1999
01:30:32,590 --> 01:30:33,760
Oh my god.

2000
01:30:41,130 --> 01:30:42,010
Okay.

2001
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:47,430
No.

2002
01:30:48,950 --> 01:30:49,890
Yeah!

2003
01:30:50,250 --> 01:30:51,090
Let's go!

2004
01:30:51,230 --> 01:30:52,470
Oh my god!

2005
01:30:52,470 --> 01:30:55,370
Oh, let's go.

2006
01:30:55,810 --> 01:30:58,350
Oh my god, clutch that one round.

2007
01:31:00,450 --> 01:31:01,670
Let's go.

2008
01:31:02,330 --> 01:31:04,430
That's a great- not washed.

2009
01:31:04,470 --> 01:31:05,810
I still got it.

2010
01:31:06,170 --> 01:31:08,390
I still fucking got it.

2011
01:31:12,270 --> 01:31:15,910
Oh my god, that's right.

2012
01:31:16,250 --> 01:31:19,030
Yes, MVP, let's go!

2013
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:23,880
That's right.

2014
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:27,020
That's right, just give me an off.

2015
01:31:27,140 --> 01:31:28,400
And I got this.

2016
01:31:29,480 --> 01:31:32,000
Stupid ass fucking one-shot weapon.

2017
01:31:32,140 --> 01:31:33,480
That's so fucking broken.

2018
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:36,080
That's actually so broken.

2019
01:31:38,900 --> 01:31:41,300
Confirmed, not washed.

2020
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:42,480
There we go.

2021
01:31:42,980 --> 01:31:45,360
She took on the draining weight.

2022
01:31:46,100 --> 01:31:48,460
That's such a broken weapon.

2023
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:49,760
All right, let's try.

2024
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:52,500
I want to try the other arcane modes.

2025
01:31:52,620 --> 01:31:53,180
What was it?

2026
01:31:54,580 --> 01:31:55,100
Oh, break.

2027
01:31:55,180 --> 01:31:56,280
Oh, let's do dual master.

2028
01:31:56,520 --> 01:31:57,740
That's the 1v1, right?

2029
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:02,960
Okay, let's see how abs- I'm about to crash out.

2030
01:32:03,080 --> 01:32:04,920
I'm about to crash out.

2031
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:06,400
Why?

2032
01:32:09,700 --> 01:32:11,300
Is he okay?

2033
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:16,740
Guys, he's about to crash out.

2034
01:32:17,020 --> 01:32:18,580
Guys, but why?

2035
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:19,540
Is he okay?

2036
01:32:20,140 --> 01:32:21,900
This is mad, okay?

2037
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:28,800
Wait, how- is there no one that wants the 1v1?

2038
01:32:29,220 --> 01:32:30,020
I don't understand.

2039
01:32:30,180 --> 01:32:31,040
I'll do the warm-up.

2040
01:32:32,900 --> 01:32:36,560
He's going to- guys, I think he's about to crash out, guys.

2041
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:42,720
I think- Oh my god, that gun is so fucking broken.

2042
01:32:43,340 --> 01:32:45,880
That actually is a broken ass gun.

2043
01:32:46,620 --> 01:32:47,440
Holy shit.

2044
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:51,720
This is just- this is just deathmatch to wait for Qs.

2045
01:32:52,120 --> 01:32:53,900
Like that Valorant deathmatch shit.

2046
01:32:54,780 --> 01:32:59,260
I mean the guns feel like- they feel like Apex though.

2047
01:33:00,860 --> 01:33:06,100
They don't feel like- the recoil does not feel like Valorant.

2048
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:09,060
It feels like Apex.

2049
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:13,820
So it's easier to- I think this is very easy to aim, not gonna lie.

2050
01:33:17,550 --> 01:33:18,590
There you go.

2051
01:33:20,530 --> 01:33:22,050
Yeah, they're hitscan.

2052
01:33:22,490 --> 01:33:24,690
The- the- um, what's it called?

2053
01:33:25,870 --> 01:33:27,950
The spread is like non-existent.

2054
01:33:28,710 --> 01:33:30,710
As long as you can aim, it's fine.

2055
01:33:30,990 --> 01:33:34,870
I don't feel any spread or recoil for this gun.

2056
01:33:35,710 --> 01:33:37,950
Like it just literally feels like an Apex gun.

2057
01:33:38,510 --> 01:33:43,170
Like I feel like I'm using a- I feel like I'm using a flatline right now.

2058
01:33:43,730 --> 01:33:44,470
That's how I feel.

2059
01:33:44,530 --> 01:33:45,950
It doesn't feel like an actual AK.

2060
01:33:47,750 --> 01:33:49,170
I guess like hipfire, yeah.

2061
01:33:49,430 --> 01:33:50,650
If you're using hipfire, yeah.

2062
01:33:52,630 --> 01:33:54,310
Like this is not fair.

2063
01:33:57,630 --> 01:33:59,150
This is just hitscan.

2064
01:33:59,350 --> 01:34:00,650
It's literally just hitscan.

2065
01:34:04,240 --> 01:34:05,040
There you go.

2066
01:34:05,900 --> 01:34:08,000
I think I'm bullying this one guy right now.

2067
01:34:10,940 --> 01:34:15,280
I don't know why I just put random turrets around too, just for the sake of it.

2068
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:21,980
No, this feels- no, it doesn't- no, it's not um, it doesn't feel like a R301.

2069
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:23,000
This feels like a flatline.

2070
01:34:25,020 --> 01:34:29,400
I don't feel like um, I don't feel like I'm using a carbine.

2071
01:34:29,480 --> 01:34:35,720
I feel like I'm using a- because of the- the speed of the shots does not feel like a carbine.

2072
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:37,680
Holy moly.

2073
01:34:37,680 --> 01:34:39,400
Bro, no one wants to duel?

2074
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:47,120
I'm like waiting for- I'm like, I want- oh my god, I swear to god, if I waited so long, I'm just gonna get absolutely shit-troyed.

2075
01:34:49,540 --> 01:34:53,640
I'm gonna get absolutely destroyed when I do the- when I actually get into a duel.

2076
01:34:53,880 --> 01:34:55,340
I will be so sad.

2077
01:34:57,160 --> 01:34:59,260
The moment I get into a real duel.

2078
01:35:00,120 --> 01:35:04,280
I'm just trying- I'm literally just trying to wait for my 1v1.

2079
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:05,940
Does no one like 1v1?

2080
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Is it that bad?

2081
01:35:09,380 --> 01:35:11,520
Is 1v1 not that fun?

2082
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:14,440
I just want to see what it's like.

2083
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:18,820
Like I'm having- it might not be that fun.

2084
01:35:21,570 --> 01:35:23,030
At least I'm warmed up.

2085
01:35:24,910 --> 01:35:26,850
You're showing why.

2086
01:35:28,890 --> 01:35:37,290
I don't think- I think for Valor players, maybe like if you know the utility as a Valorant player, you might be okay with this game.

2087
01:35:37,290 --> 01:35:44,490
But like I legitimately think this game is only good if- Like the gunplay is not like Apex.

2088
01:35:44,650 --> 01:35:46,210
Like not like Valorant at all.

2089
01:35:46,370 --> 01:35:50,230
Like I cannot aim in Valorant because I don't know how to handle the spread.

2090
01:35:50,630 --> 01:35:53,750
Because I can literally aim while running around.

2091
01:35:54,490 --> 01:35:59,050
Which is like- in Valorant, you have to stop and shoot and I cannot fucking do that.

2092
01:35:59,370 --> 01:36:02,110
I- I cannot stop and shoot.

2093
01:36:02,690 --> 01:36:04,590
I cannot stop and shoot in Valorant.

2094
01:36:06,550 --> 01:36:07,310
Yeah.

2095
01:36:11,710 --> 01:36:14,070
Like, this is- this is just Apex.

2096
01:36:14,750 --> 01:36:21,490
Apex slash- Um, I guess you can say Apex and Marble Rivals aim.

2097
01:36:22,270 --> 01:36:29,990
But like there's not a lot of games where you can- Where you can aim like this.

2098
01:36:31,870 --> 01:36:32,630
Okay.

2099
01:36:34,190 --> 01:36:35,870
All right, goodbye.

2100
01:36:37,090 --> 01:36:38,890
Guys, please cool down.

2101
01:36:39,730 --> 01:36:41,210
Guys, calm down.

2102
01:36:42,330 --> 01:36:43,810
Guys, calm down.

2103
01:36:46,010 --> 01:36:46,650
No!

2104
01:36:47,510 --> 01:36:50,250
No one wants the 1v1!

2105
01:36:50,530 --> 01:36:51,370
Or Call of Duty.

2106
01:36:51,550 --> 01:36:52,990
Yeah, I can see that as a con.

2107
01:36:56,010 --> 01:36:59,250
Yeah, it feels- Okay.

2108
01:36:59,630 --> 01:37:01,410
Oh my god, finally!

2109
01:37:02,870 --> 01:37:03,510
Finally!

2110
01:37:09,570 --> 01:37:12,430
Guys, I feel like I'm gonna wait for this log.

2111
01:37:12,610 --> 01:37:14,210
It won't even be worth it.

2112
01:37:14,250 --> 01:37:17,930
It won't even- I'm gonna get like insta-destroyed.

2113
01:37:17,990 --> 01:37:21,930
I feel like- Wait, no, there's other people in here.

2114
01:37:22,010 --> 01:37:23,610
Wait, I thought it was 1v1.

2115
01:37:25,250 --> 01:37:27,050
Okay, I'll use this.

2116
01:37:27,190 --> 01:37:28,550
What if I just sniper?

2117
01:37:29,370 --> 01:37:29,870
You know what?

2118
01:37:29,910 --> 01:37:30,850
Let's try it out.

2119
01:37:31,430 --> 01:37:32,210
I'm curious.

2120
01:37:32,690 --> 01:37:36,790
So at least if I don't do well, I can make an excuse being like I was using a sniper.

2121
01:37:37,710 --> 01:37:38,230
Hahaha!

2122
01:37:42,810 --> 01:37:44,670
That's just gonna be my excuse.

2123
01:37:45,870 --> 01:37:48,030
Wait, how is it 1v1 as a group?

2124
01:37:48,190 --> 01:37:50,450
I thought dueling was actual duels.

2125
01:37:50,870 --> 01:37:52,290
Oh, there it is.

2126
01:37:53,230 --> 01:37:57,650
All right, guys, if I fail, I just say I was sniping.

2127
01:38:08,550 --> 01:38:09,470
Where are they?

2128
01:38:09,890 --> 01:38:10,950
Wait, this is the scout.

2129
01:38:12,050 --> 01:38:12,990
I'm pretty sure.

2130
01:38:26,100 --> 01:38:29,680
Wait, this is not the sniper.

2131
01:38:30,200 --> 01:38:31,820
Wait, this is not the sniper.

2132
01:38:32,160 --> 01:38:33,580
Wait, wait, what?

2133
01:38:34,600 --> 01:38:37,440
Was this not- is this- is this the sniper?

2134
01:38:38,640 --> 01:38:39,400
Oh, shit.

2135
01:38:39,460 --> 01:38:40,340
I got the wrong one.

2136
01:38:40,660 --> 01:38:42,040
I took the wrong gun, guys.

2137
01:38:42,620 --> 01:38:45,000
I- I took the wrong gun.

2138
01:38:45,480 --> 01:38:47,120
I was like, no way.

2139
01:38:48,020 --> 01:38:49,160
This is not felon.

2140
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:52,640
Wait, they don't have the sniper.

2141
01:38:54,760 --> 01:38:56,400
It's fine, I don't need it.

2142
01:38:58,320 --> 01:38:59,840
I don't need it.

2143
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:01,200
It's fine.

2144
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:03,080
I don't need it.

2145
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:06,760
Wait, what was the sniper called?

2146
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:10,740
I literally just went by like, you know, I go by like the position.

2147
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:12,520
I don't read, guys.

2148
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:13,100
You know that.

2149
01:39:13,160 --> 01:39:15,220
I literally went by the position of the gun.

2150
01:39:16,040 --> 01:39:19,140
No, I can't swap my gun!

2151
01:39:19,340 --> 01:39:19,780
No!

2152
01:39:21,740 --> 01:39:23,700
What do I do?

2153
01:39:27,820 --> 01:39:28,760
Is it to the right?

2154
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:39,080
This way.

2155
01:39:42,060 --> 01:39:43,340
Okay, there you go.

2156
01:39:43,980 --> 01:39:45,160
There we go.

2157
01:39:46,140 --> 01:39:48,800
I can't even swap it.

2158
01:39:49,180 --> 01:39:51,000
I can't even swap my

2159
01:39:59,570 --> 01:40:01,030
- the fuck is this?

2160
01:40:01,110 --> 01:40:01,970
I don't know what that is.

2161
01:40:03,450 --> 01:40:05,170
Oh, he's just using util!

2162
01:40:05,470 --> 01:40:06,250
Fucking cheater!

2163
01:40:07,650 --> 01:40:09,590
Oh, you're still so bad.

2164
01:40:12,710 --> 01:40:17,010
Imagine using util and still not winning that.

2165
01:40:20,070 --> 01:40:21,770
It don't matter.

2166
01:40:23,610 --> 01:40:25,850
It don't matter for you.

2167
01:40:26,850 --> 01:40:28,870
Util just doesn't matter.

2168
01:40:29,820 --> 01:40:30,150
Right?

2169
01:40:31,910 --> 01:40:34,050
Imagine losing that.

2170
01:40:39,370 --> 01:40:41,190
All right, nice.

2171
01:40:41,950 --> 01:40:42,970
Wait, what?

2172
01:40:43,290 --> 01:40:43,890
Where am I?

2173
01:40:44,230 --> 01:40:45,530
Oh, I don't have to play.

2174
01:40:46,710 --> 01:40:48,390
Wait, why don't I have to play?

2175
01:40:48,450 --> 01:40:50,750
What the fuck?!

2176
01:40:50,750 --> 01:40:51,570
Bro!

2177
01:40:52,050 --> 01:40:54,430
It's not even an aim game anymore!

2178
01:40:55,170 --> 01:40:57,490
This is not even about aiming!

2179
01:41:03,330 --> 01:41:05,250
You don't even have to aim!

2180
01:41:05,710 --> 01:41:11,450
It's literally just- Okay, that's cool.

2181
01:41:13,330 --> 01:41:15,510
Is he gonna use util on me again?

2182
01:41:20,740 --> 01:41:21,660
I think he knew it.

2183
01:41:32,790 --> 01:41:34,090
Get- get out.

2184
01:41:35,050 --> 01:41:37,130
I'm using a shotgun.

2185
01:41:37,770 --> 01:41:39,530
Get the fuck out of my game.

2186
01:41:39,530 --> 01:41:40,050
Get-

2187
01:41:55,960 --> 01:41:57,280
Get out.

2188
01:41:58,100 --> 01:41:59,780
Get out of my game.

2189
01:42:04,040 --> 01:42:07,920
I have the wrong gun and I'm still shitting on you, buddy.

2190
01:42:12,190 --> 01:42:16,030
I'm literally using the fucking worst gun right now for myself.

2191
01:42:20,570 --> 01:42:22,590
Whoa, my round is empty.

2192
01:42:22,830 --> 01:42:23,390
Let's go.

2193
01:42:23,550 --> 01:42:26,670
I get a free buy again.

2194
01:42:31,290 --> 01:42:36,250
I'm gonna get so fucked over the moment I have to fight this guy because he actually has a real gun.

2195
01:42:37,470 --> 01:42:39,370
This guy has a real fucking gun.

2196
01:42:39,490 --> 01:42:41,110
I don't know what I'm gonna be doing.

2197
01:42:44,590 --> 01:42:46,010
Wait, Bob has level two.

2198
01:42:46,010 --> 01:42:47,290
Oh, Bob's dead.

2199
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:51,760
Do I get another buy?

2200
01:42:51,980 --> 01:42:53,160
Another buy?

2201
01:42:53,260 --> 01:42:54,320
Let's go!

2202
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,360
I wanna swap my gun.

2203
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:03,000
I don't wanna use this gun.

2204
01:43:05,940 --> 01:43:07,120
Let's fucking go.

2205
01:43:08,900 --> 01:43:10,540
I get another buy?

2206
01:43:12,300 --> 01:43:14,180
Oh no, I'm fighting him now.

2207
01:43:16,900 --> 01:43:17,860
Oh no.

2208
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:22,380
Bro, this is fucking bullshit.

2209
01:43:23,400 --> 01:43:24,480
This is util shit.

2210
01:43:39,180 --> 01:43:39,820
Okay.

2211
01:43:44,020 --> 01:43:45,480
Okay, sure.

2212
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:49,860
I'm worried about his- the gun he has.

2213
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:53,240
He might actually have a real gun.

2214
01:43:56,040 --> 01:43:57,500
Yeah, he has a real gun.

2215
01:43:57,600 --> 01:43:59,140
Oh my god, I can finally swap guns.

2216
01:43:59,260 --> 01:44:00,520
Okay, where is it?

2217
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:01,600
All right, is it this one?

2218
01:44:02,180 --> 01:44:02,620
All right.

2219
01:44:02,780 --> 01:44:03,240
Let's see.

2220
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:04,840
I can fuck around a little bit.

2221
01:44:05,060 --> 01:44:06,460
I'm gonna see if I can fuck around.

2222
01:44:09,200 --> 01:44:10,820
If I can't, I'll just use the AK.

2223
01:44:18,440 --> 01:44:19,000
Wait, where am I?

2224
01:44:19,260 --> 01:44:19,600
What?

2225
01:44:19,740 --> 01:44:20,880
Oh, he did the thing!

2226
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:22,760
He did the thing!

2227
01:44:25,850 --> 01:44:26,190
Okay.

2228
01:44:27,090 --> 01:44:29,070
Oh my- wait, I can't swap my gun.

2229
01:44:29,910 --> 01:44:32,750
Oh, he did the spirited away shit.

2230
01:44:32,870 --> 01:44:34,250
That shit is cool though.

2231
01:44:34,310 --> 01:44:35,230
I have to admit.

2232
01:44:37,010 --> 01:44:39,330
Whenever he does that, that shit is cool.

2233
01:44:40,230 --> 01:44:42,050
Like, how do you counter that too?

2234
01:44:42,930 --> 01:44:43,590
That's crazy.

2235
01:44:43,810 --> 01:44:45,050
Bro, he's dashing?

2236
01:44:51,210 --> 01:44:52,250
He's here right now.

2237
01:44:52,330 --> 01:44:53,110
I can- oh fuck.

2238
01:44:53,590 --> 01:44:54,190
Wait, what?

2239
01:44:55,450 --> 01:44:56,490
I don't understand.

2240
01:44:57,910 --> 01:44:59,290
Bro, this guy knows the map.

2241
01:44:59,370 --> 01:45:00,050
I don't.

2242
01:45:00,390 --> 01:45:03,930
He actually- He fucking knows the map.

2243
01:45:04,030 --> 01:45:05,370
I'm so confused.

2244
01:45:07,550 --> 01:45:08,050
No!

2245
01:45:08,430 --> 01:45:10,730
He actually knows the map!

2246
01:45:13,890 --> 01:45:16,390
He actually knows the fucking map.

2247
01:45:16,490 --> 01:45:17,290
I'm like, what?

2248
01:45:17,770 --> 01:45:19,030
Where do I go?

2249
01:45:19,510 --> 01:45:21,510
No, if he wins this, it's a good fight.

2250
01:45:21,830 --> 01:45:25,930
He knows how- he's been playing this game for- you can tell he's been playing for a while.

2251
01:45:27,690 --> 01:45:29,550
Because he actually knows how to play.

2252
01:45:30,410 --> 01:45:33,150
He actually- he knows how to play this.

2253
01:45:37,550 --> 01:45:40,370
Yeah, I'm like confused about the map.

2254
01:45:42,010 --> 01:45:45,430
I'm not fucking- oh, he does that.

2255
01:45:45,830 --> 01:45:46,590
Bro, he's doing this.

2256
01:45:46,770 --> 01:45:48,350
The TP shit is scary too.

2257
01:45:48,750 --> 01:45:50,190
The spirited away shit?

2258
01:45:52,370 --> 01:45:53,650
Oh, gg's.

2259
01:45:54,130 --> 01:45:54,770
gg's.

2260
01:45:55,190 --> 01:45:58,030
He actually knows his character and he knows the fucking map.

2261
01:45:58,410 --> 01:45:58,730
Yeah.

2262
01:45:58,730 --> 01:45:58,890
Yeah.

2263
01:46:03,690 --> 01:46:05,170
That was close.

2264
01:46:05,330 --> 01:46:06,430
That was fun though.

2265
01:46:06,810 --> 01:46:07,630
That was close.

2266
01:46:08,630 --> 01:46:10,790
He has more knowledge than me.

2267
01:46:11,770 --> 01:46:13,850
I literally was relying on pure aim.

2268
01:46:16,070 --> 01:46:18,910
I was relying on pure aim.

2269
01:46:19,090 --> 01:46:22,030
I mean, I got some fucking good ass kills there.

2270
01:46:23,310 --> 01:46:23,810
Yeah.

2271
01:46:24,930 --> 01:46:29,210
How come you can't use- uh, that was more fun than- yeah, that's fun.

2272
01:46:29,330 --> 01:46:31,270
Why is that game mode dead?

2273
01:46:31,270 --> 01:46:38,590
That game mode was actually- I think that game mode was more fun than the actual mode.

2274
01:46:40,060 --> 01:46:41,570
Not gonna lie.

2275
01:46:42,870 --> 01:46:45,030
Yeah, I fucked around a lot too.

2276
01:46:45,230 --> 01:46:46,990
I was like, oh shit, what's that?

2277
01:46:50,090 --> 01:46:55,110
Yeah, I'm surprised that- I'm surprised that game mode is not that popular.

2278
01:46:55,670 --> 01:46:57,150
Uh, Aifan, thank you for the super chat.

2279
01:46:57,210 --> 01:46:57,490
Thank you.

2280
01:46:57,550 --> 01:46:58,010
Thank you.

2281
01:46:58,090 --> 01:47:01,570
The sister is secretly telling us she wants to play Valorant.

2282
01:47:01,790 --> 01:47:05,930
I think also, I- my character is not a 1v1 character.

2283
01:47:06,230 --> 01:47:13,490
I think everybody was using- I noticed that everybody was using the the robot guy and then the bat guy.

2284
01:47:13,650 --> 01:47:16,170
The guy that- the guy that got second place.

2285
01:47:16,530 --> 01:47:19,330
Everyone was using the second place guy and then the robot guy.

2286
01:47:19,510 --> 01:47:22,390
I just played Nitro because I was like, well,

2287
01:47:26,030 --> 01:47:29,610
I was just- I just played Nitro because I was just like, I don't know.

2288
01:47:29,790 --> 01:47:31,970
I've been playing Nitro the entire time.

2289
01:47:33,450 --> 01:47:35,650
Yeah, I got second though for my first time.

2290
01:47:37,350 --> 01:47:39,350
I feel like that game mode was fun.

2291
01:47:39,430 --> 01:47:40,610
I really enjoyed that one.

2292
01:47:42,410 --> 01:47:44,970
Yeah, I enjoyed that game mode.

2293
01:47:47,050 --> 01:47:57,150
People don't like facing reality that they're not good at the- bro, okay, that guy that kept like fucking- The shotgun was fucking so bad.

2294
01:47:58,150 --> 01:48:00,150
He was so bad.

2295
01:48:01,910 --> 01:48:03,790
That was crazy.

2296
01:48:07,530 --> 01:48:08,950
Oh my god.

2297
01:48:09,830 --> 01:48:12,470
Everybody I challenged was like, eh.

2298
01:48:13,110 --> 01:48:15,510
Until the second place guy was an actual match.

2299
01:48:15,770 --> 01:48:19,470
I think if I had map knowledge and character knowledge.

2300
01:48:20,610 --> 01:48:20,950
Um...

2301
01:48:20,950 --> 01:48:22,010
Oh, wait, I'm here.

2302
01:48:22,090 --> 01:48:22,490
Oh, wait.

2303
01:48:22,650 --> 01:48:23,590
Is this infected?

2304
01:48:24,650 --> 01:48:26,070
Oh, it's infected time.

2305
01:48:26,170 --> 01:48:27,350
Wait, what does select card?

2306
01:48:28,170 --> 01:48:29,250
Headshot master?

2307
01:48:30,950 --> 01:48:31,950
What the fuck?

2308
01:48:33,110 --> 01:48:33,750
Where is he?

2309
01:48:34,030 --> 01:48:34,710
It's time.

2310
01:48:35,230 --> 01:48:36,110
Where are you?

2311
01:48:38,010 --> 01:48:38,990
Where is he?

2312
01:48:40,130 --> 01:48:41,170
I hear him.

2313
01:48:41,270 --> 01:48:42,350
Oh, there he is.

2314
01:48:43,110 --> 01:48:44,010
There you are.

2315
01:48:44,110 --> 01:48:44,370
No!

2316
01:48:44,750 --> 01:48:45,730
I'm gonna get you.

2317
01:48:45,950 --> 01:48:46,270
Yeah!

2318
01:48:46,730 --> 01:48:47,710
Nom nom nom nom.

2319
01:48:49,210 --> 01:48:51,710
Nom nom nom nom.

2320
01:48:52,610 --> 01:48:54,190
I'm gonna get you.

2321
01:48:54,270 --> 01:48:55,350
You think you're safe?

2322
01:48:55,510 --> 01:48:58,630
I didn't know what I was doing, but I got you.

2323
01:48:59,710 --> 01:49:01,190
Where's the last man?

2324
01:49:01,550 --> 01:49:03,790
Okay, there is no way a survivor is living this.

2325
01:49:04,030 --> 01:49:05,810
I have two- three thousand hp.

2326
01:49:06,370 --> 01:49:09,530
I refuse to believe a survivor can live this.

2327
01:49:11,530 --> 01:49:15,530
Why like- How do I- god.

2328
01:49:19,230 --> 01:49:20,750
Where's the last woman?

2329
01:49:22,550 --> 01:49:24,050
Last man surviving.

2330
01:49:24,690 --> 01:49:24,790
Here?

2331
01:49:27,310 --> 01:49:28,590
Somebody's hiding.

2332
01:49:29,230 --> 01:49:31,810
Oh, they're not even shooting.

2333
01:49:31,990 --> 01:49:32,970
They're just hiding.

2334
01:49:33,410 --> 01:49:35,990
Oh, that little bitch!

2335
01:49:38,410 --> 01:49:39,970
Oh, they're dead.

2336
01:49:41,750 --> 01:49:43,470
There's way too many infected guys.

2337
01:49:43,670 --> 01:49:45,250
Bro, look at how many infected!

2338
01:49:45,390 --> 01:49:46,670
Oh my god!

2339
01:49:47,510 --> 01:49:48,850
Guys, we're not good.

2340
01:49:49,010 --> 01:49:50,190
Guys, I'm scared.

2341
01:49:50,370 --> 01:49:52,490
Guys, I'm so scared.

2342
01:49:52,590 --> 01:49:53,630
I don't think we're good.

2343
01:49:53,950 --> 01:49:56,170
Guys, we gotta- wait, how did you dash?

2344
01:49:58,170 --> 01:49:59,550
How did you do that?

2345
01:50:00,710 --> 01:50:02,270
Wait, how do you dash?

2346
01:50:02,370 --> 01:50:03,830
I never learned that mechanic.

2347
01:50:07,890 --> 01:50:08,690
Wait, what?

2348
01:50:08,770 --> 01:50:09,690
Is it the knife?

2349
01:50:10,510 --> 01:50:10,950
Oh.

2350
01:50:13,490 --> 01:50:13,930
Oh!

2351
01:50:14,910 --> 01:50:15,510
Oh!

2352
01:50:15,510 --> 01:50:17,790
Oh, so that's how they were dashing!

2353
01:50:18,450 --> 01:50:18,770
Oh!

2354
01:50:21,450 --> 01:50:22,730
Don't worry, guys.

2355
01:50:23,850 --> 01:50:25,890
Don't worry, I got this.

2356
01:50:27,350 --> 01:50:30,090
Oh, so that's how all of them were dashing earlier.

2357
01:50:30,410 --> 01:50:31,290
I get it now.

2358
01:50:31,410 --> 01:50:32,530
Okay, don't worry.

2359
01:50:34,490 --> 01:50:35,750
There's no way.

2360
01:50:36,550 --> 01:50:37,530
Oh shit!

2361
01:50:37,610 --> 01:50:38,470
Oh my god!

2362
01:50:38,470 --> 01:50:41,530
Why me?!

2363
01:50:41,530 --> 01:50:43,350
Why me?!

2364
01:50:43,350 --> 01:50:47,430
It's not- Oh my god!

2365
01:50:47,970 --> 01:50:50,050
I'm so unlucky!

2366
01:50:55,380 --> 01:50:57,090
That's not fair!

2367
01:50:58,270 --> 01:51:00,590
I can't believe it!

2368
01:51:01,650 --> 01:51:04,030
I'm so sad.

2369
01:51:04,950 --> 01:51:07,160
Oh, how do I get up?

2370
01:51:08,470 --> 01:51:08,530
I -

2371
01:51:11,850 --> 01:51:15,330
I literally spawn next to me!

2372
01:51:16,050 --> 01:51:17,970
It's not fair!

2373
01:51:18,150 --> 01:51:19,650
I wanna kill you!

2374
01:51:20,310 --> 01:51:22,090
How do you get up here?

2375
01:51:23,770 --> 01:51:25,030
Oh, okay, that's out.

2376
01:51:25,850 --> 01:51:28,290
Okay, I'm gonna kill you.

2377
01:51:28,510 --> 01:51:30,770
I'm gonna kill you.

2378
01:51:32,070 --> 01:51:35,070
That's right, I'm so mad!

2379
01:51:36,390 --> 01:51:38,670
I'm so mad!

2380
01:51:38,670 --> 01:51:38,810
I'm so mad!

2381
01:51:39,970 --> 01:51:47,110
I literally spawned next to an infected!

2382
01:51:48,030 --> 01:51:49,830
It's not fair!

2383
01:51:53,250 --> 01:51:55,990
How could this do this to me?

2384
01:51:56,530 --> 01:51:59,010
I just wanna play!

2385
01:52:01,950 --> 01:52:04,870
It's so fa- how- there's no way to win this.

2386
01:52:05,010 --> 01:52:05,630
There's no way.

2387
01:52:05,710 --> 01:52:07,910
There's- they put too many infected in here.

2388
01:52:11,470 --> 01:52:12,110
Okay.

2389
01:52:13,890 --> 01:52:14,890
That's cute.

2390
01:52:15,370 --> 01:52:18,010
That little guy hiding in the corner!

2391
01:52:18,550 --> 01:52:20,250
That's really cute, buddy.

2392
01:52:22,590 --> 01:52:25,030
It's literally hide and seek now.

2393
01:52:26,010 --> 01:52:28,590
How could they do this to me?

2394
01:52:29,010 --> 01:52:31,010
I made my mistakes.

2395
01:52:32,910 --> 01:52:34,670
That's actually so fun.

2396
01:52:36,990 --> 01:52:37,830
Wait, up top?

2397
01:52:37,970 --> 01:52:38,570
They're up top.

2398
01:52:39,390 --> 01:52:40,630
They're up top.

2399
01:52:41,950 --> 01:52:42,630
Parkour.

2400
01:52:43,730 --> 01:52:45,750
Guys, I'm figuring out parkour real quick.

2401
01:52:45,850 --> 01:52:46,510
Guys, I'm stuck.

2402
01:52:48,330 --> 01:52:49,010
Parkour.

2403
01:52:51,310 --> 01:52:51,990
Parkour.

2404
01:52:52,170 --> 01:52:53,550
How do we parkour this?

2405
01:52:54,410 --> 01:52:54,830
Guys.

2406
01:52:55,950 --> 01:52:57,870
Guys, how- We did it!

2407
01:52:57,970 --> 01:52:58,990
Alright, this mode sucks.

2408
01:52:59,150 --> 01:53:00,150
This game mode sucks.

2409
01:53:01,250 --> 01:53:02,810
This is a bad game mode.

2410
01:53:06,410 --> 01:53:08,370
They put too many infected.

2411
01:53:09,050 --> 01:53:10,790
Alright, this game mode sucks.

2412
01:53:13,770 --> 01:53:15,530
It- there's- it's just not enough.

2413
01:53:15,630 --> 01:53:18,550
There's not- there's too many infected and the map is way too small.

2414
01:53:19,410 --> 01:53:20,450
It's way too small.

2415
01:53:20,550 --> 01:53:20,730
Alright.

2416
01:53:21,710 --> 01:53:23,430
Alright, let's do one last game, guys.

2417
01:53:23,670 --> 01:53:24,970
I love Duel Master.

2418
01:53:24,970 --> 01:53:27,290
That one had to be my- the most fun one.

2419
01:53:30,690 --> 01:53:31,590
Yeah, let's do it.

2420
01:53:31,610 --> 01:53:32,910
Let's end it with Team Deathmatch.

2421
01:53:33,130 --> 01:53:33,590
Fuck it.

2422
01:53:34,170 --> 01:53:35,770
Let's call- end it with Team Deathmatch.

2423
01:53:37,890 --> 01:53:40,130
Yeah, 3000 HP is too much, dude.

2424
01:53:40,250 --> 01:53:40,430
Yeah.

2425
01:53:40,550 --> 01:53:43,190
Map is too much and 3000 HP is a lot.

2426
01:53:44,030 --> 01:53:45,090
Is this the cool guy?

2427
01:53:45,290 --> 01:53:47,430
The one where he did the- Oh, I found him.

2428
01:53:51,120 --> 01:53:51,860
Try other guns?

2429
01:53:52,020 --> 01:53:53,010
What other guns should I try?

2430
01:53:53,470 --> 01:53:53,870
Try.

2431
01:53:57,030 --> 01:53:59,330
I don't think I can- I don't think I can learn another character.

2432
01:53:59,530 --> 01:54:00,430
My brain's too small.

2433
01:54:04,620 --> 01:54:06,420
Alright, select skill cards to equip them.

2434
01:54:06,460 --> 01:54:09,320
In card select, press the key to activate the card used.

2435
01:54:09,880 --> 01:54:12,540
On mat takes effect, select tactical cards.

2436
01:54:13,200 --> 01:54:18,240
Um, I'm still- I should play a su- I'll still- I'll do- I'll still do Lancer.

2437
01:54:18,860 --> 01:54:20,620
Alright, what other guns are good, though?

2438
01:54:21,380 --> 01:54:21,780
Shotguns?

2439
01:54:21,780 --> 01:54:22,480
I might could try.

2440
01:54:23,380 --> 01:54:24,680
Yeah, let's try a shotgun.

2441
01:54:26,460 --> 01:54:27,100
Uh...

2442
01:54:27,100 --> 01:54:28,860
Where's my shard used?

2443
01:54:29,780 --> 01:54:30,440
Where's my card?

2444
01:54:30,740 --> 01:54:31,480
Oh, there it is.

2445
01:54:33,900 --> 01:54:34,540
Uh...

2446
01:54:35,860 --> 01:54:36,860
Bombing signal?

2447
01:54:36,980 --> 01:54:38,180
Oh, my god.

2448
01:54:38,260 --> 01:54:38,560
Wait.

2449
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:42,560
Oh, wait!

2450
01:54:43,260 --> 01:54:44,820
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

2451
01:54:47,460 --> 01:54:48,520
There you go.

2452
01:54:48,760 --> 01:54:49,540
Ha, ha, ha.

2453
01:54:49,580 --> 01:54:52,060
Wait, I like that.

2454
01:54:53,580 --> 01:54:54,060
Wait.

2455
01:54:57,480 --> 01:55:03,620
Wait, wha- Bro, I cannot get close enough for this.

2456
01:55:09,740 --> 01:55:10,520
Oh, my god.

2457
01:55:10,560 --> 01:55:11,420
I wish I had a normal gun.

2458
01:55:11,920 --> 01:55:13,580
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

2459
01:55:15,300 --> 01:55:17,040
Guys, I don't like this gun, guys.

2460
01:55:17,260 --> 01:55:20,700
I am not- I am not using the shotgun.

2461
01:55:20,880 --> 01:55:22,780
They're all too far away, guys.

2462
01:55:23,400 --> 01:55:26,280
They're all way too far away for the shotgun.

2463
01:55:27,700 --> 01:55:29,940
If they were closer, I'd use it.

2464
01:55:33,170 --> 01:55:36,130
They all play like a little bitch sometimes.

2465
01:55:43,020 --> 01:55:43,880
Oh, fuck!

2466
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:46,800
Wait, they shot you and not- They shot me and not you?

2467
01:55:48,880 --> 01:55:49,400
What?

2468
01:55:49,520 --> 01:55:50,220
Oh, shit.

2469
01:55:50,520 --> 01:55:51,560
I did not think they would.

2470
01:55:52,720 --> 01:55:53,500
Wait, can I shoot outside?

2471
01:55:53,620 --> 01:55:54,400
No, I can't.

2472
01:55:56,960 --> 01:55:57,480
Okay.

2473
01:56:00,680 --> 01:56:01,560
That's crazy.

2474
01:56:01,980 --> 01:56:03,340
Wait, it's just literally just shooting.

2475
01:56:05,660 --> 01:56:06,940
We're just shooting.

2476
01:56:11,520 --> 01:56:11,960
Okay.

2477
01:56:13,220 --> 01:56:15,740
I'm gonna save my thing for E.

2478
01:56:15,840 --> 01:56:17,220
I think E is the best one.

2479
01:56:20,340 --> 01:56:20,780
Okay.

2480
01:56:22,780 --> 01:56:24,100
I'm gonna save it for E.

2481
01:56:26,660 --> 01:56:28,340
Oh, why did I use it here?

2482
01:56:28,440 --> 01:56:31,920
Oh, wait, if I used it here, it would've been fucking...

2483
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:32,960
Wait, do I have grenades?

2484
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:34,180
I don't have grenades.

2485
01:56:35,080 --> 01:56:36,040
Yeah, I don't.

2486
01:56:36,180 --> 01:56:37,320
There's no grenades in this game.

2487
01:56:39,940 --> 01:56:42,300
Wait, what if I use sniper, actually?

2488
01:56:43,020 --> 01:56:44,560
I think I can kill all these guys with sniper.

2489
01:56:46,240 --> 01:56:46,700
100%.

2490
01:56:46,700 --> 01:56:48,780
No, these guys are not that good.

2491
01:56:48,840 --> 01:56:49,660
I can kill them with sniper.

2492
01:56:54,660 --> 01:56:55,780
Or- What?

2493
01:56:56,480 --> 01:56:56,940
Okay.

2494
01:56:57,240 --> 01:56:57,800
That's it.

2495
01:57:00,460 --> 01:57:01,160
That's it.

2496
01:57:06,500 --> 01:57:07,560
That's it.

2497
01:57:08,460 --> 01:57:09,260
That's it.

2498
01:57:09,260 --> 01:57:09,540
Pick me.

2499
01:57:10,380 --> 01:57:11,500
Come on.

2500
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:15,800
I got 150.

2501
01:57:24,470 --> 01:57:26,250
That's fucking right.

2502
01:57:30,410 --> 01:57:31,550
That's fucking right.

2503
01:57:32,290 --> 01:57:34,030
Aw, that's not fair.

2504
01:57:34,270 --> 01:57:34,950
That's not fair.

2505
01:57:35,010 --> 01:57:36,010
He has the bullet shield.

2506
01:57:37,150 --> 01:57:38,190
There we go.

2507
01:57:39,190 --> 01:57:41,190
Wait, aw, he slid down!

2508
01:57:47,250 --> 01:57:47,770
No!

2509
01:57:48,370 --> 01:57:49,550
Wait, is he gonna die to that?

2510
01:57:49,870 --> 01:57:52,590
Wait, he doesn't die to that?

2511
01:57:52,650 --> 01:57:53,350
I can't tell.

2512
01:57:56,570 --> 01:57:58,930
I can't tell if he's gonna die to that.

2513
01:58:02,700 --> 01:58:02,980
Okay.

2514
01:58:04,460 --> 01:58:05,480
The slide.

2515
01:58:05,760 --> 01:58:07,340
I don't know how to slide efficiently.

2516
01:58:09,540 --> 01:58:11,120
I don't know how to do it.

2517
01:58:11,120 --> 01:58:12,400
Is it C?

2518
01:58:12,640 --> 01:58:13,800
Oh, I guess it is C.

2519
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:14,280
Okay.

2520
01:58:14,980 --> 01:58:15,460
It's C.

2521
01:58:15,920 --> 01:58:16,620
I know now.

2522
01:58:17,200 --> 01:58:19,220
I wanna save up for E.

2523
01:58:19,480 --> 01:58:20,140
No survivors.

2524
01:58:21,040 --> 01:58:21,900
Wait, what?

2525
01:58:21,980 --> 01:58:23,360
Oh, I didn't see him!

2526
01:58:27,360 --> 01:58:29,320
It's never too close for snipers.

2527
01:58:30,640 --> 01:58:32,480
Guys, it's never too close, guys.

2528
01:58:44,330 --> 01:58:44,810
142?

2529
01:58:45,190 --> 01:58:45,610
Okay.

2530
01:58:45,910 --> 01:58:47,230
I was gonna say, there's no way.

2531
01:58:52,390 --> 01:58:55,310
There's no way that was gonna be a 142 for me.

2532
01:58:56,170 --> 01:58:57,790
Oh my god.

2533
01:58:59,410 --> 01:59:00,450
Come on.

2534
01:59:01,550 --> 01:59:02,730
Oh, fuck!

2535
01:59:06,220 --> 01:59:07,380
Are you serious?

2536
01:59:07,480 --> 01:59:08,040
Little fucker.

2537
01:59:08,480 --> 01:59:10,240
Bro, the cross angles!

2538
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:13,100
The fucking cross angles!

2539
01:59:13,360 --> 01:59:14,400
You fucking whore!

2540
01:59:16,640 --> 01:59:19,580
I have to keep track of two different angles!

2541
01:59:20,500 --> 01:59:21,060
Alright.

2542
01:59:22,080 --> 01:59:22,860
Fuck it.

2543
01:59:23,060 --> 01:59:24,040
Back to...

2544
01:59:25,760 --> 01:59:26,860
Back to AK.

2545
01:59:28,320 --> 01:59:30,280
Maybe it's too close.

2546
01:59:32,040 --> 01:59:33,680
It's never too close.

2547
01:59:34,740 --> 01:59:36,120
Oh, but they're winning though.

2548
01:59:36,160 --> 01:59:37,020
Wait, is it to 100?

2549
01:59:39,440 --> 01:59:40,300
There we go.

2550
01:59:40,980 --> 01:59:43,380
It's to 100, which is a lot.

2551
01:59:44,400 --> 01:59:46,800
I need to wait for regen too, which is annoying.

2552
01:59:55,920 --> 01:59:56,340
Nice.

2553
01:59:58,680 --> 01:59:59,100
Nice.

2554
01:59:59,980 --> 02:00:01,120
My regen, real quick.

2555
02:00:02,200 --> 02:00:03,520
I figured it out though.

2556
02:00:03,560 --> 02:00:05,800
I figured out how to play this stupid deathmatch.

2557
02:00:07,320 --> 02:00:07,740
There we go.

2558
02:00:08,820 --> 02:00:09,480
Oh, shit!

2559
02:00:14,260 --> 02:00:16,040
I was gonna say, what is he doing in my spot?

2560
02:00:22,010 --> 02:00:22,810
Alright, nice.

2561
02:00:26,090 --> 02:00:26,930
Oh, shit!

2562
02:00:27,590 --> 02:00:28,890
Okay, I'm gonna use it.

2563
02:00:29,050 --> 02:00:30,370
Just cause they're all there.

2564
02:00:30,730 --> 02:00:32,230
I'm gonna use it.

2565
02:00:32,570 --> 02:00:36,190
No, I see all that too!

2566
02:00:39,510 --> 02:00:40,850
Alright, that's fine.

2567
02:00:44,150 --> 02:00:44,710
No!

2568
02:00:45,170 --> 02:00:49,160
My skill streak!

2569
02:00:51,300 --> 02:00:53,220
Oh my god, I'm so close to 25.

2570
02:00:55,820 --> 02:00:57,280
Oh, I can't break it.

2571
02:00:57,280 --> 02:00:59,450
I could break it and then it would be worth it.

2572
02:01:00,840 --> 02:01:02,980
It would've been so worth it if I could break it.

2573
02:01:06,120 --> 02:01:07,620
Okay, don't die.

2574
02:01:08,220 --> 02:01:09,260
Don't fucking die.

2575
02:01:09,380 --> 02:01:11,280
I need you to stay alive so I can get...

2576
02:01:13,120 --> 02:01:15,720
Oh my god, there's a lot of people there.

2577
02:01:17,660 --> 02:01:19,020
I need a regen.

2578
02:01:23,060 --> 02:01:24,540
Don't die, buddy!

2579
02:01:25,700 --> 02:01:30,120
Bro, they all have shields!

2580
02:01:31,840 --> 02:01:33,460
These guys are cowards!

2581
02:01:34,380 --> 02:01:36,360
Oh my god, they're playing Bunker.

2582
02:01:36,600 --> 02:01:37,700
Fucking pussies.

2583
02:01:38,740 --> 02:01:40,380
They're actual pussies.

2584
02:01:48,780 --> 02:01:50,140
Oh my god.

2585
02:01:50,380 --> 02:01:51,960
No, I almost got out!

2586
02:01:55,190 --> 02:01:56,230
Oh shit, what?

2587
02:01:57,090 --> 02:01:57,930
What shot me?

2588
02:01:58,950 --> 02:02:01,930
Oh my god, I was like, what the fuck?

2589
02:02:01,930 --> 02:02:03,930
What the fuck?

2590
02:02:05,650 --> 02:02:07,710
Please, I'm so close!

2591
02:02:11,740 --> 02:02:12,510
Here we go.

2592
02:02:13,230 --> 02:02:14,470
No, I have

2593
02:02:19,580 --> 02:02:20,140
to...

2594
02:02:20,140 --> 02:02:22,720
I'm trying to kill people this side!

2595
02:02:27,030 --> 02:02:27,850
Okay.

2596
02:02:35,480 --> 02:02:37,090
Oh my god, he stole it from me.

2597
02:02:41,700 --> 02:02:42,520
Nice.

2598
02:02:44,160 --> 02:02:44,980
19.

2599
02:02:45,540 --> 02:02:45,980
No!

2600
02:02:52,540 --> 02:02:53,560
Oh my god.

2601
02:02:53,640 --> 02:02:53,880
Oh my god, please.

2602
02:02:54,580 --> 02:02:56,800
I'm so close to the Y1.

2603
02:02:57,140 --> 02:02:59,080
No, I'm so close!

2604
02:03:04,260 --> 02:03:07,000
I literally need...

2605
02:03:08,760 --> 02:03:11,460
Oh my god, I'm so close to the points I need.

2606
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:16,200
I'll break this.

2607
02:03:16,380 --> 02:03:17,780
If it's the last thing I do.

2608
02:03:21,590 --> 02:03:22,970
Oh my god, I'm almost there.

2609
02:03:25,830 --> 02:03:26,450
Let's go!

2610
02:03:26,470 --> 02:03:27,190
One more kill!

2611
02:03:30,400 --> 02:03:31,380
One more kill.

2612
02:03:32,100 --> 02:03:33,260
I'm actually one more kill.

2613
02:03:33,880 --> 02:03:34,480
Please.

2614
02:03:35,320 --> 02:03:36,300
Please, no!

2615
02:03:37,560 --> 02:03:38,460
I need this kill!

2616
02:03:38,540 --> 02:03:39,900
I need this kill, you don't understand!

2617
02:03:45,950 --> 02:03:46,550
Yes!

2618
02:03:47,450 --> 02:03:49,250
We win because of it!

2619
02:03:49,610 --> 02:03:50,430
We won!

2620
02:03:50,870 --> 02:03:52,630
We won by the dip!

2621
02:03:53,010 --> 02:03:54,270
Let's fucking go!

2622
02:03:54,490 --> 02:03:57,250
I can't, let's go!

2623
02:03:57,670 --> 02:03:59,530
I was like, give me that one kill!

2624
02:03:59,530 --> 02:04:00,110
Let's go!

2625
02:04:00,250 --> 02:04:02,290
And I got the highlight.

2626
02:04:05,770 --> 02:04:07,710
Tactical nuke incoming.

2627
02:04:08,410 --> 02:04:09,430
Oh my god.

2628
02:04:09,450 --> 02:04:11,310
My nuke did it.

2629
02:04:11,790 --> 02:04:13,910
And I carried too, guys.

2630
02:04:14,010 --> 02:04:15,270
Let's fucking go.

2631
02:04:15,970 --> 02:04:17,670
Oh my god, look at that.

2632
02:04:19,130 --> 02:04:21,330
Yeah, I carried.

2633
02:04:21,690 --> 02:04:22,650
What can I say?

2634
02:04:23,210 --> 02:04:24,790
Yeah, that was me.

2635
02:04:25,190 --> 02:04:26,830
37 kills, yeah.

2636
02:04:29,530 --> 02:04:31,850
I went tactical in the end.

2637
02:04:32,230 --> 02:04:33,130
That's me.

2638
02:04:35,290 --> 02:04:36,970
Oh my god, that's fun.

2639
02:04:37,930 --> 02:04:38,550
That's fun.

2640
02:04:38,690 --> 02:04:50,230
I honestly, though, I think the dual mode is a lot I think the dual mode is a lot more fun than, um, I have no idea what the fuck that was.

2641
02:04:50,750 --> 02:04:55,950
Than the main game mode, only because the 1v1 was very exciting.

2642
02:04:56,190 --> 02:05:01,290
The 1v1 is really good aim and practice, and I like how it makes you think more about your abilities more.

2643
02:05:04,890 --> 02:05:07,390
The main game mode was just too fast.

2644
02:05:07,870 --> 02:05:08,250
I think.

2645
02:05:08,550 --> 02:05:12,250
I think the main game mode was not, um, just happens too fast, too.

2646
02:05:12,730 --> 02:05:15,690
This blends in way too much, not gonna lie.

2647
02:05:16,010 --> 02:05:18,450
This blends in the background so much I can never tell.

2648
02:05:21,870 --> 02:05:23,770
But yeah, I hope you guys enjoyed it.

2649
02:05:24,050 --> 02:05:25,890
I definitely enjoyed checking it out.

2650
02:05:26,550 --> 02:05:34,490
Um, my favorite mode, like I said, um, Duel Master and then, uh, wait, what's this?

2651
02:05:34,610 --> 02:05:36,730
Use weapons left behind.

2652
02:05:36,810 --> 02:05:38,530
Oh, this is like kill confirmed.

2653
02:05:38,750 --> 02:05:40,090
That's kill confirmed, basically.

2654
02:05:40,610 --> 02:05:44,010
Duel Master, and then I would say Sniper Deathmatch was really fun.

2655
02:05:44,530 --> 02:05:53,670
Um, I did, I did Sander was alright, but I'll put it at number 3, and then Outbreak not the most, Outbreak was the worst one out of all the modes.

2656
02:05:54,350 --> 02:05:56,130
Unlocks at level 30?

2657
02:05:56,690 --> 02:05:57,530
Are you serious?

2658
02:05:57,810 --> 02:06:01,090
That is, okay, wait, I do rank, I do level up really fast.

2659
02:06:01,190 --> 02:06:03,270
I'm level 10 after 2 hours, so like, it's not that bad.

2660
02:06:03,530 --> 02:06:05,030
I was gonna say, level 30?

2661
02:06:05,190 --> 02:06:07,450
The cutoff is fucking insane.

2662
02:06:08,030 --> 02:06:11,230
Like, haha JR, thank you for the super chat.

2663
02:06:11,310 --> 02:06:12,270
Thank you, thank you.

2664
02:06:12,650 --> 02:06:17,450
Um, but yeah, that's my opinion on, uh, Frag Punk.

2665
02:06:17,550 --> 02:06:18,990
It was great checking it out with you guys.

2666
02:06:20,390 --> 02:06:22,150
Uh, uh, one hour, yeah one hour?

2667
02:06:22,250 --> 02:06:23,030
No, it's two hours.

2668
02:06:23,210 --> 02:06:26,550
It took two hours to get to level 10, so it wasn't that bad.

2669
02:06:26,770 --> 02:06:29,670
But yeah, guys, um, I hope you guys enjoyed watching.

2670
02:06:30,010 --> 02:06:41,570
I wish I could do more like, um, do more like Zatsudan after gaming, but I'm trying to take care of my voice, um, every stream right now until it's like fully back to where it is, cause I'm still coughing.

2671
02:06:41,970 --> 02:06:43,390
I still need to take cough drops.

2672
02:06:43,630 --> 02:06:46,190
So, anyway, before I go, it's time to chill!

2673
02:06:47,170 --> 02:06:47,570
Yes!

2674
02:06:48,150 --> 02:06:52,030
Um, you guys didn't know, my YouTube plushies are out right now!

2675
02:06:52,310 --> 02:06:57,190
So you can get them and click the link pinned in the chat, or like, I can put it here as well.

2676
02:06:57,310 --> 02:06:58,010
Okay, let me see.

2677
02:06:58,850 --> 02:07:01,130
Uh, I can also link it in chat right now.

2678
02:07:01,490 --> 02:07:03,150
Um, but yes, it helps a lot.

2679
02:07:03,370 --> 02:07:06,390
It also helps me with future opportunities as well.

2680
02:07:06,510 --> 02:07:12,490
If you purchase, and more people buy the merch, the more opportunities we get in the future for more merch as well!

2681
02:07:12,730 --> 02:07:14,150
So I really appreciate it, guys.

2682
02:07:14,210 --> 02:07:24,490
If you want to add some plushies to your Doki Bridge Shrine, this is the time to get them, because after the pre-order window is over, um, you won't be able to order them again.

2683
02:07:24,690 --> 02:07:27,310
So, like, this is like, you know, it's like FOMO type shit.

2684
02:07:27,470 --> 02:07:28,210
So, uh...

2685
02:07:30,210 --> 02:07:35,390
So, unfortunately, after the pre-orders are done, um, um, it will be gone forever.

2686
02:07:35,810 --> 02:07:39,990
So, yeah, you could be, like, exclusive dragoons and have some of these plushies.

2687
02:07:40,410 --> 02:07:43,910
Um, the pre-order ends on...

2688
02:07:43,910 --> 02:07:44,270
Let me check.

2689
02:07:44,330 --> 02:07:47,410
I know it's, like, in next month, because it's four weeks.

2690
02:07:47,530 --> 02:07:49,730
It ends in 19 days.

2691
02:07:49,950 --> 02:07:51,350
So, uh...

2692
02:07:52,010 --> 02:07:54,030
I don't know how many 19 days are.

2693
02:07:55,850 --> 02:07:56,730
April 4th.

2694
02:07:56,810 --> 02:08:00,230
It ends on April 4th, everybody.

2695
02:08:00,470 --> 02:08:02,390
So, yeah, check out the plushies.

2696
02:08:03,750 --> 02:08:08,370
I know I said I'll take pictures of them soon, but, like, um, I've been a little busy.

2697
02:08:08,490 --> 02:08:10,570
But I will take pictures of them, guys, I promise!

2698
02:08:10,730 --> 02:08:13,490
I will take pictures of these plushies soon, because they're really...

2699
02:08:13,490 --> 02:08:15,610
The tomato plushie is actually the big, like...

2700
02:08:15,610 --> 02:08:20,830
By the way, the proportions of these plushies are not accurate on the pictures, regarding, like, if they're all the same size.

2701
02:08:21,090 --> 02:08:25,730
The tomato plushie is bigger than both of these plushies, by the way.

2702
02:08:26,090 --> 02:08:26,250
I...

2703
02:08:28,030 --> 02:08:29,090
I'll say it now.

2704
02:08:29,270 --> 02:08:33,070
I have all of them, and the tomato plushies is bigger than both of them.

2705
02:08:33,650 --> 02:08:35,150
Um, so, yeah.

2706
02:08:35,670 --> 02:08:37,250
Anyway, guys, uh...

2707
02:08:37,250 --> 02:08:38,430
Ozero, thank you for the superchat.

2708
02:08:38,510 --> 02:08:39,130
Thank you, thank you.

2709
02:08:39,290 --> 02:08:42,330
Watching this while farming in Warzone blessed me with good drops.

2710
02:08:42,570 --> 02:08:42,790
Nice.

2711
02:08:42,930 --> 02:08:44,350
At least someone's getting lucky tonight.

02:08:44,630 --> 02:08:45,710
Thank you for the superchat.

2713
02:08:45,850 --> 02:08:46,830
Thank you, thank you.

2714
02:08:47,090 --> 02:08:52,970
Anyway, guys, as always, everybody, stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

2715
02:08:53,090 --> 02:08:56,650
And if you see that from me, head to bed, cause you deserve it.

2716
02:08:56,790 --> 02:08:58,310
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

2717
02:08:58,750 --> 02:08:59,530
Bye, guys!

2718
02:08:59,950 --> 02:09:00,350
Bye!

2719
02:09:00,890 --> 02:09:04,310
Also, next week, we're gonna have a collab with Team Brawl Pro.

2720
02:09:04,730 --> 02:09:05,690
So, we're gonna...

2721
02:09:06,210 --> 02:09:12,250
Um... We're gonna be playing Reaper with Coney, Slime, and Brawl Pro.

2722
02:09:12,470 --> 02:09:14,590
I don't know if anyone else... I don't know if... Not Slime.

2723
02:09:14,870 --> 02:09:15,490
No, not Slime.

2724
02:09:15,890 --> 02:09:16,230
Uh, Matt.

2725
02:09:16,350 --> 02:09:21,750
I don't know if Slime's joining, but for now, it's me, Coney, Brawl Pro, um, and Matt.

2726
02:09:21,950 --> 02:09:23,030
I don't know if Slime's joining.

2727
02:09:23,170 --> 02:09:25,270
Anyway, guys, it's next... It'll be on Tuesday.

2728
02:09:25,470 --> 02:09:26,530
Anyway, guys, I'll see you guys later!

2729
02:09:26,930 --> 02:09:27,530
Bye, everybody!

2730
02:09:27,750 --> 02:09:27,990
Bye!

2731
02:09:28,090 --> 02:09:29,690
Gotta feed Doki and Birdo.

2732
02:09:29,750 --> 02:09:30,270
She's hungry.

2733
02:09:30,530 --> 02:09:31,690
He's asking for food.

2734
02:09:31,970 --> 02:09:32,730
Okay, he's not asking.

2735
02:09:32,850 --> 02:09:33,670
He's demanding for food.

2736
02:09:33,790 --> 02:09:34,230
Bye, everyone!

2737
02:09:34,410 --> 02:09:34,770
Bye!
