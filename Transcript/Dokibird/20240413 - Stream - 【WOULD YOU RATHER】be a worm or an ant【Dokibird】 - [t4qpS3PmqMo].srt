00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:53,790
Hello everybody!

2
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,850
Hello hello!

3
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:57,870
Oh my gosh.

4
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:02,990
There was like, there's so many like life updates I wanted to give you guys today.

5
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,870
There's so many things going on.

6
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:11,370
Every day... okay it's like before stream, work.

7
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:12,950
After stream, work.

8
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,790
It has not calmed down at all yet.

9
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,850
It's like oh my god.

10
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:24,670
There's just, I wish I could like leak but I can't because contracts.

11
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:27,470
It's just, oh I'm so excited.

12
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:34,690
The next couple of months is gonna be like, there's just so many things packed up the next couple of months.

13
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,570
Let's just say, I can say this.

14
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:37,190
I'll say this.

15
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,470
Let's just say the Doki Bird World Tour.

16
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:51,810
Let's just say, there's a lot of conventions lined up.

17
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:03,790
So, there's like one of these things that's been like on the, like on the back burner.

18
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:09,150
Like not back burner but there's been like a lot of things regarding like convention wise.

19
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:12,730
Because I feel like I can say stuff like that because it's not just like you know, it's not one convention.

20
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:16,290
There's like multiple conventions that's like in the works.

21
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:16,770
And I feel like I can say stuff like that because it's not just like you know, it's not one convention.

22
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:22,510
And that's like one of the things that I've always like you know, I really, really, really wanted to like meet you guys.

23
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,190
I really want to meet my dragoons.

24
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:27,110
And you know like, I never had the chance.

25
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,950
I mean I did have some chances.

26
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:33,670
But you know, there was like one instance where I, you know, it wasn't my choice.

27
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:42,150
Where like, I wasn't able to meet you guys last time.

28
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,890
And so like, this is like one of the things I was pushing for.

29
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:51,390
Especially when I never got a chance to meet like Canadian goons as well.

30
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:56,050
Canadian dragoons as well as like for like conventions in Canada.

31
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:03,790
I wasn't able to do like any, I wasn't fortunate enough to have like an experience to do like a convention in Canada.

32
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:08,870
Or like being able to do like more worldwide conventions and stuff like that.

33
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:15,190
So there's, I'll just say like you know, the Doki Bird World Tour.

34
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,610
Could be a reality.

35
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:22,170
It's actually crazy.

36
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,770
Okay, I didn't, okay same with like for those who don't know.

37
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:30,290
For those who, okay for those who don't know and don't follow me on Twitter.

38
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:36,110
There was like stuff like, guys, Medi, I'm getting my passport immediate.

39
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,250
Thank you in the super chat.

40
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:37,530
Thank you.

41
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,310
Medi, it's not just Canada.

42
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,890
It's a world tour.

43
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,170
It's, it's a, it's a world tour.

44
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,210
It's a world tour.

45
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:50,310
That means I would be in various places in the world.

46
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,510
I might even be in America.

47
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,450
You don't need to get a passport.

48
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:56,950
Like...

49
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:05,210
So one of the things I've always wanted was to be able to meet like dragoons around the world.

50
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:14,130
And I was, lately I haven't been fortunate enough to sort of have, you know, a little sort of be able to do that.

51
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:19,270
So, um, hey friend, thank you for the one, uh, one ship.

52
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:19,930
Give this ship.

53
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:20,270
Thank you.

54
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:20,790
Thank you.

55
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:30,410
Um, and, uh, and I'm trying to like, try not to say too many things to get in, I'm trying not to get in trouble right now chat.

56
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:34,330
So I'm trying to like limit what I can say and what I can't say.

57
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:38,630
But like, uh, some of you guys weren't following me on Twitter.

58
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:41,890
Uh, uh, I be power.

59
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:42,590
I have a power.

60
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,810
And Hyatt sent me a PC.

61
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:50,310
Remember when I kept telling you guys, you guys were like, Doki, please, buy a new PC, Doki.

62
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,230
For the love of God, you keep crashing.

63
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:58,670
By the way, I'm still have, uh, by the way, I'm still using my old PC still.

64
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,830
But anyway, they're like, please.

65
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,050
And I'm like, I, I, I know guys.

66
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:09,690
It's just that there is a PC that's sort of stuck in Canadian customs right now.

67
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,190
And finally, it's finally unstuck.

68
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:14,030
It's been stuck in Canadian, I swear.

69
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:18,110
It's been stuck in Canadian customs for like about two weeks now.

70
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:24,430
Like, like, like, it's been stuck for like maybe like two to three weeks in Canadian customs.

71
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:27,190
Because, uh, I don't know.

72
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:30,370
I don't know why, but it's been stuck there for a very long time.

73
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:35,830
But today, well technically like, yeah, today we sort of like got the PC finally.

74
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,830
Um, after we sorted it out with everything.

75
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:43,770
But it was actually, it was, I wouldn't say it's like actually insane.

76
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,430
Because like, I didn't realize this.

77
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,490
I thought it was just unmarketable.

78
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:53,730
Like, I legitimately thought, I legitimately thought I was just, you know, I saved my mind too much.

79
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,030
Or like, I'm just unmarketable.

80
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:56,610
I'm not cute enough.

81
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:03,090
Or like, I'm not the cute anime girl that like, that fits the mold.

82
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,650
Or like, I thought I was like just unmarketable.

83
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:08,510
And like, I was like, oh, I didn't try hard enough.

84
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,490
But like, it's actually crazy.

85
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,830
But there's been so many like sponsors.

86
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:18,450
And so many like conventions that have like reached out to me.

87
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,970
And was like, we've always wanted to work with you.

88
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:23,890
And like, and I'm like, really?

89
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:25,350
Me?

90
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:29,530
I thought, I thought I was just unmarketable.

91
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:30,710
I didn't.

92
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:33,530
They're like, we've always wanted to work with you, Doki.

93
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,630
And like, it's crazy.

94
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:36,610
There were so many.

95
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,590
There were so many.

96
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:38,670
And I was like, me?

97
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:39,790
I was so surprised.

98
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:40,470
Especially conventions.

99
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:42,270
I was like, wait, what?

100
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:42,630
Really?

101
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,210
You wanted me to be there?

102
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:50,930
I'm like, and then like, okay, cause so like, they need, you need to charge.

103
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:53,110
Like we charge, when you're doing appearance fees.

104
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:57,590
We charge like, you have to charge yourself for appearance fees.

105
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,130
You know, you obviously can't do it for free.

106
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,830
Because how the fuck am I gonna survive?

107
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:10,010
And so like, so.

108
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:15,550
So like, they're like, how much is your appearance fees for like conventions?

109
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,210
And I was like, oh, it's this much.

110
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,210
Is it too expensive?

111
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:20,530
I hope it's enough.

112
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:23,470
Like, I was like, I hope it's not too expensive.

113
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:32,830
I was told by my, I was told by my manager that this is like, that should be like the general range for appearance fees.

114
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:40,670
And then, and then like one of my friends who's, who's one of my friends who does like, convention stuff.

115
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:46,490
She was like, telling me, she was scolding me and was like, your appearance fees are too cheap.

116
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:49,750
And I was like, I don't know.

117
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:50,070
I

118
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:54,830
don't know what I'm doing.

119
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,410
Cause I've never done stuff.

120
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,890
And then my friend was like, you're too cheap.

121
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:02,590
What the fuck?

122
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:05,290
Like, you need to charge more for your appearance fees.

123
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:06,890
They all want you right now.

124
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,770
You need to charge more.

125
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,990
You're way too cheap.

126
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:13,510
And I'm like, I don't know.

127
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:25,390
I was like, I just, I just want to, I just wanted to go to conventions and like meet dragons.

128
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:28,090
I don't know what my price is.

129
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:39,030
So yeah, I'm like every day, every day I'm like, oh no, don't worry.

130
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:40,370
I'm it's us dollars.

131
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:47,410
Cause I was like, bro, the us dollar right now is so fucking good at the moment compared to like any other country.

132
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:48,770
I saw this thing.

133
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,430
I was so sad.

134
00:09:50,650 --> 00:10:03,430
I was like so sad because like, I don't even, I saw the Twitter post, but I don't remember which Japanese Twitter was, but there was like a Japanese Twitter that was like, try and be like, it was, that was like, oh please, please buy our stuff, like on Twitter.

135
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:13,070
Because apparently the yen is so bad right now that they're trying to get like Americans to like buy stuff in their store because of how bad the yen was.

136
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,310
Cause it's crashing apparently.

137
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,130
And they're like, please...

138
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:18,570
Please use the US dollar right now.

139
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:37,670
It's like because it's just a lot US dollars like really really good at the moment And so they're like asking people in the States to order stuff in Japan just because of how bad the yen is Yeah, it's actually crazy So that's why I like wonder like you want to want us to pay the appearance fee in US dollars or Canadian dollars?

140
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:38,490
I would like US

141
00:10:42,790 --> 00:11:03,290
I'm just like US dollars, please no matter what US dollars Because I have a US bank like I want my bank accounts accepts US dollars because I have separate US and Canadian So like I'm like if the Canadian dollar crashes at least like, you know, I can just convert my US dollars to Canadian

142
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:11,810
Because Even , you know, even the Canadian dollar is pretty fucking garbage right now.

What are things I want oh my god, okay.

191
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:56,930
I need to tell you guys the story I've been like holding back this store I've been holding back the story from the collab because like I realized like It's like such a weird story to tell but basically recently so Recently, I received some packages So I do have my own personal PO box for like receiving packages that is like,

192
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:11,690
you know receiving business packages and stuff from like events and like sponsors so like I end like from the auction to so like I have a personal PO Box for the auction items that I received and events and sponsors.

193
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:20,910
So a few days ago, my mom picked up the items from that PO Box and gave it to me.

194
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:23,070
And then we were opening up the packages.

195
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:26,910
So there was items in there from the auction and some sponsors.

196
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:31,410
So I was opening up the packages and I'm gonna have to use a code word.

197
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:32,990
So like it was going okay.

198
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:37,570
It was going okay.

199
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:43,230
I received some really cute plushies and stuff like in like artwork.

200
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:55,590
But then I opened one package and when I opened it up, it was like... I'm gonna use a code word because I don't want to get in trouble.

201
00:16:56,170 --> 00:17:01,250
Okay, so when I opened it up, it was like a bag.

202
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:02,230
A bag of grass.

203
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:05,310
And I was freaking out.

204
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:07,530
Because I've never seen that before.

205
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:11,710
I've never seen... like I've never like seen it before.

206
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,770
Like... like ever.

207
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:14,930
Because I... you know... I...

208
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:19,530
I don't.

209
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:22,750
Like... I was freaking out.

210
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,230
Because I was like...

211
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:26,810
What the fuck?

212
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:27,630
What?

213
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:31,190
I was like... did my address... my PO Box get leaked?

214
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,630
I was freaking out.

215
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:33,050
I was like...

216
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,070
Oh my god.

217
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:35,490
Did my... who sent this?

218
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:37,330
Did my PO Box get leaked?

219
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,950
Like why is there...

220
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,430
Why is the bag of grass here?

221
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:43,350
I was like... oh my god.

222
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,790
I was freaking out.

223
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:51,470
Because I was like...

224
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,650
I was like... what is this?

225
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,850
And then... and then...

226
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:01,070
We... we saw the...

227
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:03,230
We looked at the package.

228
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:04,730
And then...

229
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:05,810
Apparently...

230
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:08,330
Someone else used to rent...

231
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:09,690
This PO Box.

232
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:11,990
But they didn't change the address.

233
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:15,430
So... so it got... so it got delivered to me.

234
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,710
Because it's my PO Box now.

235
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:18,850
But I...

236
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:20,390
I was so scared.

237
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:22,250
Because I legitimately thought...

238
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:26,030
That someone actually sent me a...

239
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,110
I don't know.

240
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,830
That someone leaked my address.

241
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:30,510
My PO Box address.

242
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:32,730
And then sent it to me.

243
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:35,230
Because I don't freaking know.

244
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:36,510
And I was like...

245
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,410
Oh my god.

246
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,950
And then my mom was like laughing at me.

247
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:42,190
Because like... it was just so ridiculous.

248
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:44,270
It was so freaking ridiculous.

249
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,270
I was... I was just like...

250
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,170

251
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:48,830
I was like... oh my god.

252
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,750
Am I going to go to jail?

253
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:57,570
Um...

254
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:01,130

255
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:02,090
A couple of days ago.

256
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:03,430
I didn't want to tell the story.

257
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:05,750
I didn't want to tell the story.

258
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,690
On like the collab.

259
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:09,110
Because I was like... oh no.

260
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,370
That's going to be too awkward.

261
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:12,890
That's going to be so awkward.

262
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:14,490
Um...

263
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:15,870
Um... but yeah.

00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:20,930

266
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:22,150
I was freaking out.

267
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:23,650

00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,690
Original Gears of War games before I touch the...

338
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:25,770
Um...

339
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:28,490
Before I touch the...

340
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,930
Uh... the newest one.

341
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:33,550
Um... I've always watched my dad...

342
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:37,230
I watched my dad play the first three Gears of Wars as a little...

343
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:38,090
as a little dokey.

344
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:38,950
So...

345
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,630
I really wanted to experience it myself.

346
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:43,470
I heard the new Fallout show was really good!

347
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:44,870
Uh...

348
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:48,770
I was like... I was planning on watching the new Fallout show because...

349
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:49,330
What's his name?

350
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:50,890
Kojumbo?

351
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:52,310
Recommen... Sorry.

352
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:52,890
Uh...

353
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:56,970
Sorry.

354
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,330
Uh... Jimbo's done it again.

355
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:00,690
Uh... but he like...

356
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:04,710
recommended on... he recommended on Twitter.

357
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:07,170
Every time he recommends stuff on Twitter...

358
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:08,630
He's... I don't know.

359
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:10,130
It's usually been like pretty accurate.

360
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:10,890
And like...

361
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:14,990
When he doesn't like some... When he doesn't like a show, he'll just be like...

362
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:16,170
I watched this show.

363
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:18,770
But if he does like it, he'll just be like... Oh my god!

364
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:19,590
It was pretty good!

365
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:22,050
I just love like... his reviews.

366
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:24,590
Because it's so obvious when he doesn't like anything.

367
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,170
He'll just be like... I watched it.

368
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:31,470
And...

369
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,790
But then if it's something he enjoyed, he'd be like...

370
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:35,230
Oh my god!

371
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:35,870
It's so good!

372
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:39,710
Like... the actress was pretty... pretty well... like the acting was pretty well done.

373
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,310
Versus... I watched this.

374
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:42,870
What a... What a lad.

375
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:43,970
What?

376
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:45,490
What a lad.

377
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:48,330
Let's see.

378
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:49,250
Kaz!

379
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,090
Thank you for the super chat.

380
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:50,490
Thank you.

381
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:53,070
Kojimbo is the father of pure cinema.

382
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,490
Thank you for the super chat.

383
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:54,950
Thank you.

384
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:55,530
Thank you.

385
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:57,250
But yes.

386
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:57,750
Anyway.

387
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:05,050
I just realized we did like a fucking 23 minute like catch up Zatsu without actually doing the game.

388
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:08,810
But for those who don't know, this game is called Would You Rather?

389
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:11,850
And basically, it's like when you press the button.

390
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:12,710
It's like all the...

391
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:14,750
These are like basically like...

392
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:16,290
stream games type deal.

393
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:18,570
Because they were super popular back in the day.

394
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:19,870
Like back with like Let's Players.

395
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,790
So like when you press the button.

396
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:23,210
Would you rather?

397
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:25,650
What's the other one?

398
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:26,810
Ask the genie guy.

399
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:27,870
I forgot his name.

400
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:31,270
And then it was higher or lower.

401
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:32,530
Stuff like that.

402
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:33,230
Anyway.

403
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,270
I realized.

404
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:34,970
Oh my god.

405
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,890
I can finally do Would You Rather?

406
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:41,230
And so basically, they gave us two choices.

407
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:42,970
Would you rather?

408
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:48,750
And then when you pick a choice, you get to see who is like the majority pick.

409
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:52,710
Like oh which side did the majority of people want to pick.

410
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:53,370
And stuff like that.

411
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:54,650
So you know if you're like the majority.

412
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:56,290
You're like the...

413
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:59,470
You're like a sheep or you know you have your own way of thinking.

414
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:01,190
You think outside the box and everything.

415
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,790
So it's like basically like the Walking Dead shit.

416
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:06,090
So you know they'll be like your choices.

417
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:08,870
Here are the people who made the same choice as you.

418
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:09,530
Stuff like that.

419
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:12,150
But this one is more like Would You Rather?

420
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:13,410
Um...

421
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:15,070
Anyway.

422
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:15,710
So.

423
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:23,490
Would you rather scream loudly while you're asleep or be blind and deaf for the first 30 minutes after waking up?

424
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:28,150
I would honestly choose scream loudly while you're asleep.

425
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:34,490
Because I feel like you know how there's like those like uh... like those like sleep deprivation tanks?

426
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:35,830
What's the sleep depri... no.

427
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:37,530
Sensory depra... sorry not sleep depri...

428
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:41,270
Sensory um... those like sensory deprivation tanks.

429
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:46,270
And then when you go into like those sensory tanks you like fucking like go insane.

430
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:50,050
You can... the longer you spend in there the more insane you get.

431
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:53,770
Because when you don't have your senses like you turn crazy or something.

432
00:24:53,970 --> 00:25:00,570
So I feel like if this happens to me everyday I think I go crazy.

433
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:08,690
I feel like like 30 minutes of just nothingness by myself I feel like I just go insane in general.

434
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:09,690
And I feel everything.

435
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:11,370
I don't wanna feel stuff better.

436
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:18,980
I feel like cause then like you can't hear or see right?

437
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,360
But that doesn't stop your fucking inner demons demons or your imagination.

438
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:28,820
So I feel like your inner demons and your imagination would go fucking wild.

439
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:34,880
Because you know for the first 30 minutes cause you're trying to like invent something in your head.

440
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,180
Especially if you have like a super active imagination.

441
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,520
And stuff.

442
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,920
So I'm just like that doesn't sound fun.

443
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,860
And I don't wanna like feel something more intensely too.

444
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:51,560
Cause like you know what's that thing where you can't see or like hear your other senses start improving more?

445
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,900
And I don't like that.

446
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:00,700
My other senses don't need to improve anymore.

447
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,440
I don't wanna feel stuff more.

448
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,580
I'm okay.

449
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:08,280
I'm okay with the current amount of feeling.

450
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,280
So...

451
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,400
So...

452
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:19,000
So I'd rather I just... cause like screaming loudly while you're asleep.

453
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,900
It just happens when you're asleep.

454
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,720
So like it only affects other people.

455
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,100
Like it affects my neighbor.

456
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,320
That's fine.

457
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,700
Fuck my neighbors.

458
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,820
Like who cares about what they think.

459
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,560
Call me.

460
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,320
Thank you for the super chat.

461
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:32,660
Thank you.

462
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,120
Thank you.

463
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,880
Scream loudly while sleeping because I'm not the one being...

464
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,400
Yeah exactly.

465
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,740
It's not affecting me.

466
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,600
Like who cares about...

467
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,160
...

468
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:41,820
...

469
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,060
...

470
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,020
It's not affecting me.

471
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,440
I'm gonna need a...

472
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,060
I may be... okay.

473
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,560
Someone made a good point.

474
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,520
It will affect my throat.

475
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,380
But like what if like... but what if like...

476
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:59,400
you know... I just like tape my mouth shut.

477
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,520
I'll still be like silently screaming.

478
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,920
So um... mmm...

479
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,000
like mmm...

480
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,220
is less work than... ahh...

481
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,620
So...

482
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,580
in the end...

483
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,580
in the end... it wouldn't...

484
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,240
I'll just drink a lot of fucking...

485
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,140
warm water.

486
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:20,440
Okay.

487
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,520
Maybe... maybe I'll sleep...

488
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,620
I'll do like... you know... maybe I'll do like...

489
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,180
like... what is like...

490
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,960
intense naps like those like...

491
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:32,420
There's like a sleep cycle where you only sleep like every certain interval.

492
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:40,140
So if I sleep... if I change my sleep schedule in a way where I only sleep like particular intervals like REM sleep...

493
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,800
what is like power naps and stuff like that.

494
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:42,700
The REM cycle.

495
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:43,900
Then I'll be fine.

496
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,020
That'll be fine.

497
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,280
I mean...

498
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,140
It's... it's productive.

499
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,840
It could be productive.

500
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,880
Some people say it...

501
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,400
You think it's not healthy.

502
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:57,580
But then...

503
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,000
But... you don't...

504
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,680
You think it's not healthy.

505
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,800
But how would you know that?

506
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:03,720
Have you ever tried?

507
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,540
Yeah!

508
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:05,520
Checkmate!

509
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,440
Don't try this by the way.

510
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,840
Don't... sleep a normal sleep schedule.

511
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,780
Only if you have scream loudly while you're asleep.

512
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:11,780
Anyway...

513
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,440
Anyway...

514
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,700
I think scream loudly while you're asleep is the way to go.

515
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,060
Oh...

516
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,020
Well...

517
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,580
Those people!

518
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,180
Don't know what they're talking about.

519
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,520
They're fucking sheep.

520
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:34,680
Nice!

521
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,120
They're just sheep!

522
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,260
They don't... they're not cultured enough.

523
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,840
They're not smart enough.

524
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,740
That 39... I don't know.

525
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,280
Was it 31?

526
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:46,280
That 31% is like... those...

527
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,680
It's like... you know how they're like...

528
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,700
You need to be smart enough to understand Rick and Morty.

529
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,980
It's like being the 1% chat.

530
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,980
I was being the 1% guys.

531
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:03,400
Because I know what I'm talking about.

532
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:04,540
.

533
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:06,900
.

534
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:09,880
.

535
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:09,880
Alright.

536
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,940
Be able to explore the universe.

537
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,900
Or be able to explore the unknowns of the earth.

538
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,480
Okay, I'm not even gonna make a poll.

539
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,160
I was gonna make a poll.

540
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,120
But like...

541
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,340
I don't even have to debate.

542
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,680
I'll be the universe.

543
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:25,680
Because usually to explore the unknowns of the earth is just like primitive stuff.

544
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,140
Like, you know... Just be like, here's a forest.

545
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:28,700
Like...

546
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:32,140
Here's a forest that's never been explored before.

547
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:33,540
I don't care.

548
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,120
Like, you know what lives in a forest?

549
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,720
Fucking insects and bugs.

550
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:42,700
You know what lives in the fucking univ... Like, we don't know what lives in the universe.

551
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,700
There could be aliens.

552
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,900
To be fair, we're gonna be the aliens if we're exploring the universe.

553
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:47,880
But like...

554
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,240
One is obvious, the choice.

555
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,940
Like, what kind of question is that?

556
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,620
Like, 39%?

557
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,580
Like, oh my god.

558
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,580
Those guys are stupid.

559
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:59,480
Now, those guys are definitely stupid.

560
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,960
Be stranded in the jungle or be strand...

561
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,500
Oh my god.

562
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:02,760
Okay.

563
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:05,100
I don't even need to make a poll of this either.

564
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,040
Of course the jungle.

565
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,280
The desert has no water.

566
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,400
The jungle?

567
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,780
I can chop a coconut.

568
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:19,420
Like, there's more chances to die in the desert from dehydration and hunger than there is to the jungle.

569
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,860
And also sunburn.

570
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,580
Dude, fuck the sun.

571
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,120
But don't fuck the sun.

572
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,040
Exactly.

573
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,860
The desert has nothing.

574
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:35,680
The jung... Yes, the jungle has wild animals that I can kill and then eat.

575
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:36,700
Guys.

576
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:39,620
The animals in the jungle are food.

577
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,760
It's so easy.

578
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,260
Oh, what about the poisonous frogs?

579
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,200
What about the poisonous scorpions and snakes?

580
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,480
Snakes exist in both.

581
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,760
Like, what the fuck do you mean?

582
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,000
There's snakes in the desert too.

583
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,200
You can't avoid them.

584
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:58,840
They're everywhere.

585
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,500
Yeah, but there's always water in your sand.

586
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,600
Like, you said, right?

587
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,700
It's all one big beach.

588
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,520
Eventually!

589
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,480
But I don't have a horse to find the water, Kaz.

590
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,200
Look.

591
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,640
So, that's what I'm saying.

592
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:16,560
Like, there's already scorpions and snakes in the desert.

593
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,340
And also the jungle.

594
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:24,100
At least the jungle has, like, animals I can eat and also water I can drink easily.

595
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,700
Lots of predators?

596
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,960
There's lots of predators in the desert too!

597
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:31,720
You just don't...

598
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,840
There's a lot of predators in the desert too!

599
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,960
It's just that they wait for you to die and eat you instead because it's just easier.

600
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,520
You just die by the desert before you die by the jungle.

601
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,440
Like...

602
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:52,400
Like, you die by the whole ecosystem of the desert first before any predators fucking comes in to eat you.

603
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,400
Like...

604
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:54,860
Alright.

605
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,600
I bet you I'm the majority here.

606
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,140
I swear!

607
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:58,420
See?

608
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,280
Look, you're the 16%!

609
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:04,480
And that's not the special lower percent like I was in the beginning.

610
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:05,600
That was the...

611
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,600
That was the you are wrong percentage.

612
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:09,460
Alright.

613
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,980
Spend your entire... Okay, this one I'll make a poll.

614
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,300
I'll make a poll for this.

615
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,960
She's right, guys.

616
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:16,480
Exactly!

617
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,600
Of course I'm right!

618
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:27,040
Summer at beach versus summer in mountains.

619
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,160
Oh my god, no.

620
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:28,860
Fuck the beach.

621
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:34,820
There's no way I'm gonna choose the beach.

622
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,980
The beach fucking sucks.

623
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,920
Darkblade, thank you for the super chat.

624
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:38,260
Thank you.

625
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:38,740
Thank you.

626
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,000
Okay, here's why.

627
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,340
Here's the reason why.

628
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,400
The beach...

629
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,400
Okay, but like, what is the scope of the mountains though?

630
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,140
Like, how tall is the mountain?

631
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:47,780
Is it like...

632
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:50,080
Is it so tall that I can't breathe?

633
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,300
Like, I need like an oxygen tank to breathe?

634
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:53,860
Like, or is it like...

635
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:56,020
Is like Mount Everest type of mountain?

636
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,180
Or is it just a regular mountain?

637
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,020
Like a hill?

638
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,260
Is a hill a mountain?

639
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,080
Or is a hill like a baby mountain?

640
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,300
Anyway, no.

641
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:03,940
Fuck the beach.

642
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,580
No matter what, I don't like beaches.

643
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:08,720
I hate the... I hate the sand.

644
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,680
I hate sand.

645
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,220
And then I hate the ocean.

646
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:16,320
Because the ocean is just like nature's bathroom.

647
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:21,680
And like, you know like the sewers eventually lead to the ocean.

648
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,960
You guys know that, right?

649
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,180
The sewer...

650
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:28,220
The sewers... Sewages eventually leads to the ocean.

651
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:33,940
And like, if you think about it, the ocean is not just filled with just the nature's.

652
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:34,960
I'm not...

653
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,700
It's not just the nature's toilet.

654
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,460
It's everybody's toilet.

655
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,400
It's everywhere.

656
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:45,980
And that is why I would never pick the beach.

657
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:54,540
That's why like, ever since like the realization of me um, ever since like the real... Oh yeah, and microplastics by the way.

658
00:33:54,640 --> 00:34:01,500
Ever since the realization when I was like younger, that I was like, wait, fishes poop and pee in the ocean.

659
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:06,120
I've never been to the... Like, I've never like touched the ocean water since.

660
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:16,140
Because like, you can't be like, oh I'll just like I'll just close my mouth and not breathe the water... Like not like have the water in my...

661
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:17,920
The water's gonna be in your body no matter what.

662
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:18,800
Like...

663
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,760
The water is gonna be... You're gonna taste the water no matter what.

664
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:31,300
And ever since then, I just don't wanna touch the ocean ever since.

665
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:32,920
Ever since that part.

666
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:34,420
Um...

667
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:36,300
Fletchtop.

668
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,480
Thank you for the super chat.

669
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,280
Thank you, thank you.

670
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,140
Sudoki, you rather go hiking?

671
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,000
Remember the last time you went hiking?

672
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:42,940
Thank you for the super chat.

673
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,580
Thank you, thank you.

674
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:47,060
Okay, but that doesn't mean I'm gonna be hiking in the mountains.

675
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:49,760
What if it's a fucking city on the mountain?

676
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,120
You don't know that.

677
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,540
It never said anything regarding hiking.

678
00:34:53,940 --> 00:35:00,440
There could be literally an uh... an apartment built onto this mountain and I just never go outside.

679
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,940
Like you heard of like cabin in the woods.

680
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,240
This could be like apartment on the mountain.

681
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,160
Like...

682
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,920
It could be a cool ass resort.

683
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,320
You don't know that.

684
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:11,880
Same for the beach?

685
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,340
Yes, but the beach still has the fucking sand and the ocean.

686
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,580
The mountains doesn't have sand.

687
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,020
Um...

688
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:23,460
Um...

689
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,360
Ginger, thank you for the super chat.

690
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,240
Thank you, thank you.

691
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,080
The ocean is salty because of the baby fish.

692
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:29,700
No!

693
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,960
Oh my god, no!

694
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,660
You know what's in the ocean?

695
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:35,940
Trash island.

696
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,280
You all remember trash island?

697
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,120
That's in the ocean.

698
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,360
There's not just one trash island.

699
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,680
There's several trash islands.

700
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,440
You know what's not on the mountains?

701
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,700
Trash island.

702
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,660
There, checkmate.

703
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,440
Like...

704
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:55,940
Um...

705
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:56,440
Um...

706
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:59,480
I feel like any physical activity doki wood.

707
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,800
That is not true!

708
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,180
I am a very good hiker.

709
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:06,880
I just choose not to hike because it's a terrible experience.

710
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,440
Thank you for the super chat.

711
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,000
Thank you.

712
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:09,540
Thank you.

713
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:11,640
Um...

714
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:16,540
Anyway, so yes, I am gonna choose spend the entire summer in the mountains.

715
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:20,940
People who choose the beach are not aware about the ocean's toilet.

716
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,600
Or sorry, nature's toilet.

717
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,520
Okay, you guys are fucking idiots.

718
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,700
Oh my god!

719
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:31,980
Oh!

720
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,360
I'm so...

721
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:40,970
I don't feel comfortable answering this question.

722
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:52,990
Okay... Okay...

723
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:53,410
Okay...

724
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,230
Okay...

725
00:36:57,230 --> 00:37:01,550
Sorry, I did not feel comfortable debating this.

726
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:05,090
Okay...

727
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:05,230
Okay...

728
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:05,850
Um...

729
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:09,090
Cowardice?

730
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:10,410
Bro...

731
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,290
Stop being a coward.

732
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:16,430
It's called...

733
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:17,910
It's called ethics.

734
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,510
Everyone has...

735
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:22,550
Everyone has a code of ethics.

736
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:23,870
That was my line.

737
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:25,990
That was...

738
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:28,730
That...

739
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:31,110
That... That was my line.

740
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,390
Okay... Um...

741
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:36,650
Okay... Okay...

742
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:40,490
Burnt food versus bite tongue.

743
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:44,250
I would honestly say...

744
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:45,510
Um...

745
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:47,210
I would vote...

746
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:48,550
Oh my gosh.

747
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:50,230
But how hard would you bite your tongue?

748
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:51,190
Cause it's never...

749
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:54,170
Your tongue is gonna get like scarred up and shit.

750
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:56,230
And it... Yeah, they both... Okay...

751
00:37:56,230 --> 00:38:00,050
Is it true that eating burnt food gives you cancer?

752
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:02,470
Cause that's what my mom would always tell me.

753
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:05,750
I don't know if it's like one of those like...

754
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:07,870
Those like mom stories.

755
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:10,550
You know, mom lies and stuff.

756
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:13,670
So like I can't tell if it's like mom lies.

757
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:15,210
Uh... But yes.

758
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:16,170
Like I...

759
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:19,090
Cause like I always like burnt food.

760
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:20,310
Okay.

761
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:21,470
But like not...

762
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:24,010
Okay, not like oh I'll always eat burnt food.

763
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:27,190
But like I always like the crunch of burnt food.

764
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:28,970
So like you know the burnt crust and stuff.

765
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:32,970
Not like super burnt crust but like you know a little bit of burnt stuff.

766
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:34,550
And then like of the crunch.

767
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:37,270
And then my mom would always be like don't eat burnt food.

768
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:38,130
You're gonna get cancer.

769
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:40,710
So I don't know.

770
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,770
But then there's like a lot of those mom lies.

771
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:45,290
Um...

772
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:47,990
The mom lies that like they say it.

773
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:50,070
Because like a lot of moms would say it.

774
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:54,870
Because like you know parents love to do scare tactics for children to not do the things they wanna do.

775
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:57,110
So they'll be like don't eat this.

776
00:38:57,290 --> 00:38:58,670
Or you're gonna get cancer.

777
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:00,650
Don't eat that or you're gonna get cancer.

778
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:02,810
Don't do this or you're gonna get cancer.

779
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:04,870
Like it was...

780
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:05,710
Um...

781
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:09,670
It's always something related to cancer.

782
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:11,590
Uh because another thing.

783
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:12,830
The mom lies.

784
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:15,850
Like oh don't put your phone too near your head.

785
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:17,750
You're gonna get cancer.

786
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:18,750
From the radiation.

787
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:22,750
The radiation rays from the fucking phone.

788
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:26,570
From the fucking phone.

789
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:28,230
So...

790
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:34,250
So like the 5G's are gonna cause cancer in your brain.

791
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:36,190
And stuff.

792
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:37,410
If you put your phone...

793
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:37,990
If you like...

794
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:41,310
If you like fall asleep with the phone in your bed.

795
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:44,190
So, I don't know if that's true also.

796
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:46,570
Because I'm fucked out of way.

797
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:50,030
Because I go to... I fucking play with my phone when I sleep.

798
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:58,570
So, I don't know actually.

799
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:00,090
But I still do it.

800
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:02,970
So, well, we'll see how lucky I am.

801
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,110
Okay, anyway.

802
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:10,110
But like, how burnt is that food though?

803
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:14,210
And I feel like biting your tongue is not great.

804
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:17,270
Because it's not a great experience.

805
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:22,310
And like, biting your tongue is never...

806
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:24,510
And like, having that fucking...

807
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:29,830
You know, like when the tongue starts getting swollen at the part where you bit and stuff.

808
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,370
It's not really...

809
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:33,450
Nice experience.

810
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:38,390
And it's every time you eat.

811
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:39,590
It's every day.

812
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,290
Your fucking tongue is gonna get so...

813
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:42,630
Scarred up and like...

814
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:43,690
Beefed out.

815
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:45,850
Because like, you know, it's gonna be like...

816
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:47,230
Resilient to more bites.

817
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:48,790
And like, exactly.

818
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:49,910
Someone was like...

819
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:51,090
Hiro was like, thank you Super Chat.

820
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:51,850
Thank you, thank you.

821
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:53,370
I was like, you'll get an infection.

822
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:56,190
So, at that point, I won't die from cancer.

823
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:57,730
I'll just die from like, infections.

824
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:59,410
I mean, they're both terrible.

825
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:06,090
I won't die from the burnt food that caused cancer.

826
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:08,310
I'll just die from a fucking infection.

827
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:09,690
Because eventually...

828
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:11,290
My odds are not with me.

829
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:12,030
At that point.

830
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:13,350
Because it's every time I eat.

831
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:15,630
So like, an infection will get there somehow.

832
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:18,250
What if I want to eat like...

833
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:18,970
Like...

834
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:19,870
I don't know.

835
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:22,110
What if I want to eat something that's a little raw?

836
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:24,530
Like, that's gonna fucking suck.

837
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:25,950
So I'm gonna go with burnt food.

838
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:27,110
Because...

839
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,590
I don't know how burnt it is.

840
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:30,130
Um...

841
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:32,550
And my mom said it doesn't cause cancer.

842
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:33,010
So...

843
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:41,230
Clearly my moderator knows what's up.

844
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:44,490
So I'm gonna...

845
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:47,430
I'm gonna go with burnt food.

846
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:49,570
Uh...

847
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:50,630
Largus.

848
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:51,670
Thank you for the super chat.

849
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:52,050
Thank you.

850
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:52,530
Thank you.

851
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:56,690
We survived centuries of lead water pipes and mercury household products.

852
00:41:56,770 --> 00:41:58,210
We can survive bacon.

853
00:41:58,590 --> 00:41:59,670
Thank you for the super chat.

854
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:00,050
Thank you.

855
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:00,410
Thank you.

856
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:01,490
Why the fuck?

857
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:02,250
Who chose?

858
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:03,950
What is the ten...

859
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:06,790
Those are the people who believe that burnt food will cause cancer.

860
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:09,050
Like, there's no way.

861
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:11,150
Why would you choose...

862
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:11,210
I don't know.

863
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:12,110
Why would you choose pain?

864
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:16,810
Like, why would you choose pain over like burnt food?

865
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:19,410
You don't know how burnt it is.

866
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:21,190
Like, you can't burn everything.

867
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:24,230
What if I just drink soup the entire...

868
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:25,530
The rest of my life?

869
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:27,670
Like...

870
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:28,810
No.

871
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:30,370
What if...

872
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:31,550
What if I just...

873
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:32,730
You can't burn soup.

874
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:33,870
Okay, maybe you can.

875
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:35,830
You can burn soup a little bit.

876
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:37,010
But it's a liquid.

877
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:38,810
It's like you can't burn water.

878
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:40,430
I don't know.

879
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:40,690
I don't know.

880
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:41,050
I don't know.

881
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:41,130
I don't know.

882
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:41,190
I don't know.

883
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:43,470
How do you burn cereal?

884
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:44,590
There's no way.

885
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:45,570
What if...

886
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:46,410
What if it's more...

887
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:47,190
Marshmallows.

888
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:48,970
Burnt marshmallows is okay.

889
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:50,230
Like...

890
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:54,710
Burnt marshmallows is like alright.

891
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:58,130
I can pick and choose my food.

892
00:42:58,330 --> 00:42:58,850
There's one...

893
00:42:58,850 --> 00:43:01,770
There has to be a food that like bypasses the burnt laws.

894
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:05,290
Okay, sing versus dance.

895
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:07,090
Oh, 100% sing.

896
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:10,550
Like, you can make more money singing than dancing.

897
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:11,170
Okay.

898
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:11,930
I am so sorry.

899
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:15,310
I feel like...

900
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:16,930
I feel like...

901
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:19,910
Like profit wise and like...

902
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:25,270
And just like in general singing is just the easiest way.

903
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:28,290
Like I can make a million fucking covers in original songs.

904
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:30,130
Like albums and stuff.

905
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:30,970
People will...

906
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:36,650
More people will buy albums and songs than fucking dance videos and stuff.

907
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:38,290
Like a singer can...

908
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:38,690
Can...

909
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:40,030
Don't have to be a dancer.

910
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:41,430
But a dancer...

911
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:43,110
If they want to be like a famous dancer...

912
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:45,930
They'll have to also sort of be a singer.

913
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:47,150
Because like...

914
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:47,870
You know...

915
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:49,430
There's like lots of dance covers.

916
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:49,830
Like...

917
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:50,890
Or be in a dance group.

918
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:51,870
I feel like...

919
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:56,630
The only way you can sort of be famous as a dancer is if you're like in a dance group.

920
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:59,550
Or you're just a coach of a famous singer.

921
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:00,530
Like...

922
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:02,170
Because you know...

923
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:03,850
Singers need to hire dance coaches.

924
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:07,950
So I feel like the only way that you can like make money as a dancer...

925
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:10,330
Is just to be like a dance coach of some...

926
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:11,210
Like someone famous.

927
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:14,490
Or like be on a reality TV show for dancers.

928
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:14,910
Like...

929
00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:16,050
So you think you can dance.

930
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:16,390
Do you remember?

931
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:17,730
So you think you can dance?

932
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:18,670
That shit?

933
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:19,770
And what are they...

934
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:21,050
What the celebrities and stuff?

935
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:22,250
And then what's her name?

936
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:24,310
That mom that had eight kids?

937
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:26,070
What was it?

938
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:26,730
Six kids?

939
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:27,410
The six tuplets?

940
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:30,670
Was on that show?

941
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:31,670
The original Karen?

942
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:32,970
Oh my god.

943
00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:34,130
So you think you can dance?

944
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:35,890
Does that still exist in any way?

945
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:37,930
I remember there was like...

946
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:40,290
An episode of So You Think You Can Dance?

947
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:42,330
Where it was just...

948
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:42,970
Oh my god.

949
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:43,390
What was it?

950
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:46,810
Was it like a weeb version of So You Think You Can Dance?

951
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:48,150
Oh my god.

952
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:49,010
I'm trying to remember.

953
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:50,290
There was like...

954
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:53,330
There was like viral clip from So You Think You Can Dance?

955
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:54,790
Where it was some...

956
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:57,010
They like made a reference to like...

957
00:44:57,010 --> 00:44:57,950
Anime culture.

958
00:44:58,370 --> 00:45:00,310
I don't remember which one it was.

959
00:45:00,370 --> 00:45:00,670
It was like...

960
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:02,290
It went viral on Twitter for a little bit.

961
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:05,980
Yeah.

962
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:06,460
Yeah.

963
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:06,960
And you're like...

964
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:07,820
I can't remember what...

965
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:09,760
Thing they were referencing though.

966
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:12,000
I don't think it was an American version.

967
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,040
It was like some other fucking country.

968
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,500
I didn't.

969
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:22,360
Honestly, I think reality TV show is dying though.

970
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:27,660
There hasn't been like actual good reality TV in a long ass time.

971
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,600
Because like ethically it's like you know...

972
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,640
Because people realize...

973
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:46,280
People realize now that like watching these things on reality TV is not right morally and ethically.

974
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:48,820
It was never good.

975
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,120
If you think of...

976
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,020
Because people are like...

977
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:52,800
Wait a minute.

978
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:53,980
Is it...

979
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:54,980
People are like...

980
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:55,660
Oh my god.

981
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,700
Is it really bad to like...

982
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:01,020
Watch these little children do beauty contests?

983
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:04,620
And then show the world how fucked up the...

984
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:07,920
Like how fucked up kids pageants are.

985
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:09,160
But like...

986
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:11,360
But like frame it as a good thing.

987
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:15,320
Because I used to watch Diamonds and Tiaras a lot.

988
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:16,680
As a...

989
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,260
As a younger doki.

990
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:19,920
I watched like...

991
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,880
Diamonds and Tiaras a lot and I didn't realize things were wrong.

992
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:30,700
I didn't realize how bad the show was.

993
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:33,600
Until I was a little older.

994
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,860
Because that show...

995
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:36,460
Oh yeah sorry.

996
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,780
Toddlers and Tiaras.

997
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:39,120
Toddlers and Tiaras.

998
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:40,020
Um...

999
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,980
Because for those who've never watched Toddlers and Tiaras.

1000
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:45,060
Um...

1001
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:50,080
It's basically like a reality TV show following around like real people by the way.

1002
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:51,520
They're not like celebrities or anything.

1003
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:53,240
They're real people.

1004
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:54,340
Real children.

1005
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:55,420
Um...

1006
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:57,600
Who do like beauty pageants.

1007
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,240
Like kids.

1008
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,980
Doing beauty pageants.

1009
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:03,360
And then they talk about like you know the stuff they have to do.

1010
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,380
The sacrifices they have to make.

1011
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:08,400
The parents who feed them a lot of sugar.

1012
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,560
Like those like pixie sticks.

1013
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,320
Where it's just sugar.

1014
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:15,100
And then they'll be like...

1015
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:16,120
Oh you're tired?

1016
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:17,700
You're like...

1017
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:18,540
Oh my god.

1018
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,000
My daughter's tired.

1019
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,280
Don't worry.

1020
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:23,980
Here's three sticks of pixie sticks.

1021
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:27,360
So you can stay awake for the rest of the pageant.

1022
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:45,780
And like for like 30 seconds.

1023
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:48,080
Like they'll be like...

1024
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:51,500
And then they'll be like oh my god.

1025
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:52,000
Wow.

1026
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:53,920
Oh my god.Me Dex.

1027
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:54,400
That's so funny.

1028
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:55,140
I love know that a lot of times...

1029
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:55,140
You don't know the girl you're dating.

1030
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:56,620
Don't think she's going to move.

1031
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:57,960
You don't know your the point of Jaime and Tiaras is.

1032
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,100
So like you don't know what the point of this going to be.

1033
00:47:59,100 --> 00:47:59,960
You don't know what the point of this is going to.... And the bottom line is like...

1034
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:00,140
I'm so sorry.

1035
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:01,300
I didn't win this pageant.

1036
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:03,620
Because it's a beauty pageant.

1037
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:07,560
And it was so and so bad.

1038
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:09,460
But I was just like, aww.

1039
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:14,680
She did, you know, Lil Doki would just be like, aww, she didn't work hard enough to win.

1040
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,740
There was just someone that was just better.

1041
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:19,780
And then now, I'm like, oh my god, this is so fucked up.

1042
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:22,820
These little kids are gonna...

1043
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:26,220
These little kids grew up to be so fucked up.

1044
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:31,520
With their own perception of like, who they are as a person.

1045
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:33,780
Because they didn't...

1046
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:35,340
Because of beauty pageants.

1047
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,940
I wanna know what happened to these traumatized kids.

1048
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:41,320
That is so easy to look for.

1049
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:42,960
Just look at Honey Boo Boo.

1050
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:44,820
Oh my god.

1051
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:49,200
Like, I think like, because of what happened with the whole Honey Boo Boo shit.

1052
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:53,240
Because like, I know like their parents got divorced and stuff right after.

1053
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:59,660
Um, cause like, the dad wasn't like super into the whole beauty pageant thing.

1054
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:03,080
And like, you know, the mom was like, this made us famous.

1055
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,580
What are you talking about?

1056
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:08,640
Uh, yeah, the kids were never being normal.

1057
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:10,380
After that.

1058
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:17,840
Um, and then like, Honey Boo Boo apparently was like, super fucking depressed too.

1059
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:18,520
During that.

1060
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:23,900
Like, she did like an interview being like, oh yeah, like, oh, I got like super depressed.

1061
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:24,880
And stuff.

1062
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:26,900
Um...

1063
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:27,300
And...

1064
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:29,500
Yeah, it's just Ashley is so fucked up.

1065
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:34,860
Anyway, we realize now that reality TV...

1066
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:42,120
Re-reality TV was actually pretty messed up.

1067
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:43,420
It was entertaining.

1068
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:45,840
But then it got, it was like...

1069
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:51,540
It was entertaining like in, like, you know, if you don't look past it.

1070
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:56,360
But then when you think about what the fuck is going on, we're like whoa.

1071
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:59,400
You know, maybe this is pretty fucked up.

1072
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:01,420
Maybe...

1073
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:02,300
Maybe...

1074
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:06,340
Maybe this shit was pretty fucking bad.

1075
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:08,420
Like...

1076
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:10,120
Um...

1077
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:12,580
Um...

1078
00:50:13,330 --> 00:50:14,260
And then what else?

1079
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:14,720
What else?

1080
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:15,260
Oh yeah.

1081
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,540
And there was also like, uh, oh my gosh.

1082
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:19,420
I think like...

1083
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:23,760
Have you guys ever read that article when, you know, the pandemic started?

1084
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:31,220
And then the people in Big Brother had to had to like stop filming and they had to let them go.

1085
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:32,780
Like they had to stop filming.

1086
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:36,020
And then the contestants on Big Brother was like...

1087
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:40,940
Just found out everything that was going on regarding the pandemic.

1088
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,280
Like at once.

1089
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,940
That was so fucked up.

1090
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:48,880
So everyone was like what the fuck are you talking about, Doki?

1091
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:51,060
So Big Brother...

1092
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:57,400
Big Brother is a reality TV show where...

1093
00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:00,160
They grab a bunch of contestants.

1094
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:04,200
They could be like, you know, internet famous people or semi reality stars.

1095
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:05,500
Um...

1096
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:06,540
And everything.

1097
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:08,320
Or like they'll just be regular people.

1098
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:11,040
And then they lock them in a...

1099
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,740
They lock them in a house.

1100
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:14,560
In a mansion.

1101
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:19,320
And then they don't let them see anything on the internet.

1102
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:21,300
Like no news on TV.

1103
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:22,100
Nothing.

1104
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,160
Like no media.

1105
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,020
Like they're just locked.

1106
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:26,680
Like actual quarantine.

1107
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:29,300
But before the quarantine existed.

1108
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:34,700
So it was basically like Big Brother had a quarantine but there was no pandemic.

1109
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:37,760
But then, you know, the pandemic happened.

1110
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:42,880
And then... but the people in Big Brother didn't know what the fuck was going on.

1111
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:45,780
They...

1112
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:48,780
They did not know.

1113
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:53,300
Um... They didn't know what was going on in the outside world.

1114
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:57,580
They had zero idea what the fuck was happening.

1115
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:00,960
And then...

1116
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,600
And then they were like...

1117
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:03,320
And then...

1118
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,400
Obviously they couldn't continue filming.

1119
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:09,480
Because, you know, the production people need to be quarantined.

1120
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:12,120
You know, they're like, we can't keep doing this.

1121
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:14,840
Like the production people are like, we can't keep doing this.

1122
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:17,400
Like, you know, they have to maintain the house as well.

1123
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:17,880
You know?

1124
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:18,880
Like the...

1125
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,600
Like they have to take out the trash and everything.

1126
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:25,300
But the production people are like, we don't feel safe keep doing this.

1127
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:25,460
So...

1128
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:25,980
We can't keep doing this any longer.

1129
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,780
We need to tell them.

1130
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:32,680
We need to tell them that the world is going...

1131
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:34,080
is exploding right now.

1132
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:36,900
And...

1133
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:38,460
And...

1134
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:44,140
But yeah, like they had to let them... They had to like give them a reality check.

1135
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:48,880
While the pandemic started getting really bad.

1136
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:53,680
It was... I was like Bro, that must have been fucking terrible.

1137
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:55,460
Holy shit.

1138
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:55,820
Oh shit!

1139
00:52:55,820 --> 00:53:00,340
That was been so... they're like, oh I can't wait for Big Brother.

1140
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:10,740
I can't wait after Big Brother when like I get to go home and hang out with my family and not have to worry about the toilet paper shortage.

1141
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:27,880
And so yeah, so then there's like a clip of... there was a clip of stuff of like giving them the news and stuff about like being like, yeah, while you were being filmed in Big Brother, some shit was going on in the outside world.

1142
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,860
And then the contestants were just shocked.

1143
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:36,900
They were like, is this part of the show?

1144
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:40,720
They were just like... the contestants were just like...

1145
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:44,240
Is this... is this part of the show?

1146
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,700
Are we... are we really... like no, that can't be real.

1147
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,860
That can't... that can't be real.

1148
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:59,480
So... they went from one quarantine to another quarantine right after.

1149
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:04,320
It's like, is this a bit like... oh my god.

1150
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:05,700
It was so crazy.

1151
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:10,580
Anyway... I don't know how I got to reality TV talking about singing.

1152
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:12,420
Oh yeah, dancing with the stars.

1153
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:21,600
But yeah, anyway, I would choose singing because I feel like I could do more with the singing than I can with the dancing if I had to choose one or the other.

1154
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,480
Actual... you guys are acting, right?

1155
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:27,740
Yeah, acting.

1156
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:32,380
Yeah, I figured... I figured.

1157
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:33,820
Name a famous dancer.

1158
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:37,360
Name... name five famous dancers on the top of your head.

1159
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:38,800
I bet you can't.

1160
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:40,460
I bet you can name like one or two.

1161
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:40,720
I bet you can't.

1162
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:40,720
I bet you can name like one or two.

1163
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:41,960
But I bet you can't name five.

1164
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,860
And they're like only dancers.

1165
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,300
Not like singing dancers.

1166
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:47,880
It's just dancers.

1167
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:50,940
Alright, Pantsy, thank you for 50 gift shits.

1168
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:51,720
Thank you, thank you.

1169
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:52,020
Me.

1170
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:56,520
No, you can't say Michael Jackson because that's a singer and dancer.

1171
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:57,820
You can't say that.

1172
00:54:57,860 --> 00:54:59,580
It has to be like dancers.

1173
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:02,160
Like they're famous because of dancing.

1174
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:03,860
Not because of singing.

1175
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:08,140
You can't say Michael Jackson because Michael Jackson was famous in the Jackson 5.

1176
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:10,800
And he was like a singer in Jackson 5.

1177
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,860
It's not because of like the dancing back then.

1178
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:18,480
But I can name five famous singers on the top of my head.

1179
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,740
Always have the best hair.

1180
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:22,400
Always have the best... neither.

1181
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:23,460
I don't fucking...

1182
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:27,740
Actually, best outfit.

1183
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:28,200
No.

1184
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:30,900
Okay, I'm thinking like design wise.

1185
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:34,020
I think like...

1186
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:40,680
Okay, design wise, I feel like outfit matters more than hair.

1187
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:41,740
I think.

1188
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:43,760
Because you can have a generic hairstyle.

1189
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:48,960
But if you have a really good outfit to match along, it's memorable.

1190
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:53,020
So I would say best outfit because I feel like best...

1191
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:55,040
Also, it's more comfy too.

1192
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:59,820
Like the better the outfit, the more comfy it is as well.

1193
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:03,440
So I'd rather go with... I'm not even going to do a poll for this because I want to skip this question.

1194
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,420
I will do best outfit.

1195
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:07,720
What did I get for best outfit?

1196
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:09,400
Oh yeah, nice 60%.

1197
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,620
I knew I was the majority.

1198
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:11,620
Alright.

1199
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:14,780
Make 350k a year robbing innocent people.

1200
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,740
Make 40k a year helping people in...

1201
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:21,000
How innocent are they?

1202
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:27,860
They can't be full on innocent.

1203
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:29,120
Come on.

1204
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:32,600
Okay.

1205
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:33,380
Three...

1206
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:37,240
50k versus 40k.

1207
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:38,200
Okay.

1208
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:40,680
I'll be like...

1209
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:42,800
But Doki, what about the content?

1210
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,240
This is the content.

1211
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:48,900
Look.

1212
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:52,480
It can be sort of like robbing hood.

1213
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:53,000
You know?

1214
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:56,340
I rob from the rich to give to the poor.

1215
00:56:57,260 --> 00:56:59,260
I'm the one that's...

1216
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:01,200
Sorry, not poor.

1217
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:03,420
Rob from the rich to give to the poor.

1218
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:04,680
Give to the less fortunate.

1219
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:06,580
I am the less fortunate.

1220
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,920
I am Lord Curiosus.

1221
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:09,920
Thank you for the super chat.

1222
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:10,340
Thank you.

1223
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:10,880
Thank you.

1224
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:11,700
Outfit.

1225
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:14,380
You can be bald and a good suit still looks great.

1226
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:16,700
Totally not expecting from experience.

1227
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:17,720
Thank you for the super chat.

1228
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:17,980
Thank you.

1229
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:18,520
Exactly!

1230
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:19,900
That's exactly what I thought.

1231
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:21,780
Call me.

1232
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:22,560
Thank you for the super chat.

1233
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:22,920
Thank you.

1234
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:23,260
Thank you.

1235
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:23,740
Aren't you a...

1236
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:24,160
Exactly.

1237
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:24,880
I'm a thief.

1238
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:26,800
So of course I'll be robbing people.

1239
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:27,860
Like...

1240
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:29,000
What if it's like...

1241
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:29,220
Okay.

1242
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:31,960
Okay.

1243
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:33,020
But like...

1244
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:34,960
I can also like...

1245
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,320
I can also like...

1246
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,260
Give to...

1247
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:41,540
Give the money to the fortunate people in need as well.

1248
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:43,020
Guys.

1249
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:45,220
It could also do that.

1250
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:46,740
It doesn't mean that, you know...

1251
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:51,560
I just take the 350k and then not do anything after that.

1252
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:53,000
I could like, you know...

1253
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:57,880
Take 350k and then I'll help the people I robbed.

1254
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:00,560
They could be innocent rich people.

1255
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:01,260
They might...

1256
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:03,000
Like that money might be nothing for them.

1257
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:03,420
You know?

1258
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,720
It could be Bill Gates.

1259
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:05,680
I could have...

1260
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:09,720
I could have like robbed Bill Gates 350k.

1261
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:11,920
He doesn't care.

1262
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:18,860
350k is nothing to him.

1263
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:22,060
I'll just rob a billionaire who didn't...

1264
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:22,780
Who like...

1265
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:24,340
Was an ethical billionaire.

1266
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:29,720
Because like we all know there's some billionaires out there that are definitely not innocent.

1267
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:30,820
I don't know.

1268
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:31,240
I don't know.

1269
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,680
Zach, thank you for the super chat.

1270
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:34,160
Thank you.

1271
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:34,800
Thank you.

1272
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:36,320
We all know.

1273
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:39,040
Guys.

1274
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:40,560
We all know.

1275
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:48,340
There were a lot of billionaires out there that might have got that billions of dollars via unethical means.

1276
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:53,160
There's no way you can make a billion dollars doing stuff the right way.

1277
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:57,500
No, don't say that.

1278
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:58,440
No billionaires...

1279
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:59,260
Don't say that.

1280
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:01,220
Other than the fact that Bill Gates is burning.

1281
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:02,480
Like, don't...

1282
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:12,000
Why did Bill Gates divorce with his fucking wife after being married for so fucking long?

1283
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:16,560
A lot of people forgot the reason why they divorced was because Bill Gates cheated on his wife.

1284
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:19,680
Like, I feel like a lot of people forgot about that.

1285
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:21,840
Because, like...

1286
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:24,200
Everyone will be like, oh, but Bill Gates...

1287
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:25,600
But...

1288
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:27,100
But Bill Gates...

1289
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:28,000
He's just like...

1290
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,960
A lovable grandpa.

1291
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:31,740
Like, he's just...

1292
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:34,300
He's just like a lovable grandpa.

1293
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,360
But then, like...

1294
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:38,880
But then people forgot...

1295
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:42,820
The reason why he, you know...

1296
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:45,160
Isn't married to his wife anymore.

1297
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,280
Who he's been together with for...

1298
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:48,340
For decades.

1299
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:51,780
People never forgot about that.

1300
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:56,440
So it's like, I didn't even know he was married.

1301
00:59:56,780 --> 00:59:57,320
Yeah.

1302
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:58,660
Yeah, he was.

1303
00:59:58,820 --> 00:59:59,900
He was married.

1304
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:03,060
Also, what's his name?

1305
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:03,960
Amazon guy.

1306
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:08,180
Also, the Amazon guy as well...

1307
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:09,120
You know, like...

1308
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:12,000
His wife basically, like, supported him.

1309
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:15,800
His wife basically supported him to start Amazon.

1310
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:16,900
So, like...

1311
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:17,520
Jeff Bezos.

1312
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:19,140
I can't believe I forgot his name.

1313
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:19,820
Mr. Bezos.

1314
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:21,240
But, basically, like...

1315
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:23,340
When Jeff Bezos was like...

1316
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:25,340
He was like, you know, oh, I started...

1317
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:27,980
I started Amazon off of my garage.

1318
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:29,820
I quit my job.

1319
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:33,500
Okay, so I just got a job and started this passion project of the fucking garage thing.

1320
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:41,920
People forgot that part of the story that people don't remember is that his wife had a high paying job.

1321
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:58,440
His wife had a high paying job and basically supported him when he was doing the Amazon thing out of the garage.

1322
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:02,860
So it's not because of the whole, you know, oh my god he did...

1323
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:13,240
Because you know how people are like, I'm gonna drop out of school and become the next Facebook creator.

1324
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:14,480
Stuff like that.

1325
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:16,660
They're like, oh, Mark Zuckerberg...

1326
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:21,960
I'm gonna be just like Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos and become a billionaire.

1327
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:25,320
Because all they did was follow their dreams.

1328
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:28,300
Thing is, a lot of those people...

1329
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:35,660
A lot of these people have...

1330
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:39,980
Also, like, you're not... your university's not Harvard.

1331
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:42,160
There's also that too.

1332
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,080
You're not a Harvard dropout.

1333
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,380
There's that as well.

1334
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:52,400
Because no matter what, being a Harvard dropout still fucking brings you clout because you made it into Harvard.

1335
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:57,460
But yeah, but anyway, they had a lot of resources.

1336
01:01:57,460 --> 01:01:58,540
They weren't poor.

1337
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:01,760
They got...

1338
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:08,540
It's either their parents were super fucking rich and they gave them a loan or...

1339
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:12,360
Or like, they were actually supported by...

1340
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:18,240
They were also like supported by like their spouses and stuff.

1341
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:19,860
Like, they'll be like, it's okay, sweetie.

1342
01:02:20,020 --> 01:02:22,540
You can go to do your dream project.

1343
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:25,240
I'm gonna fucking still go to my job.

1344
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:26,120
Support you.

1345
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,780
Anyway, what was this tangent?

1346
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:31,140
Jeff Bezos divorced his wife too.

1347
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:42,220
That was where my tangent is to not...

1348
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:46,940
I don't think any billionaire in the world is clean.

1349
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:47,920
I don't think...

1350
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:53,920
Yeah, Mr. Be...

1351
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:55,900
There was a whole thing about it.

1352
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:58,340
There was a whole thing because like...

1353
01:02:58,340 --> 01:03:01,200
Because like the wife didn't sign a prenup.

1354
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:05,640
So she basically took 50% of Bezos stuff and Bezos was so fucking angry.

1355
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:06,740
He was so mad.

1356
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:14,020
Because like, you know, they didn't sign a prenup because when they got married, he wasn't rich yet.

1357
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,580
He wasn't rich yet.

1358
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:21,220
So...

1359
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:24,480
So like she actually got 50% of everything.

1360
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:25,760
Um...

1361
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:27,780
Uh...

1362
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:29,400
Maggie, thank you for the magenta soup.

1363
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:30,520
But thank you, thank...

1364
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:31,600
And he's still very rich.

1365
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:36,480
Even if he got like 50% of everything, he's still very rich.

1366
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:37,720
Like...

1367
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:38,360
There's...

1368
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:41,240
He's gonna die and he's still be a billionaire.

1369
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:42,020
There's no way.

1370
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:42,800
There's nothing...

1371
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:43,620
He can go...

1372
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:45,220
He can like spend...

1373
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:47,200
He can spend like...

1374
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:47,900
I don't know.

1375
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:49,540
50% of what he...

1376
01:03:49,540 --> 01:03:52,840
50% of what he makes and he's still gonna be a billionaire.

1377
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:55,840
His wife took 50% of his fucking...

1378
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:56,800
Like his...

1379
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:59,080
Like his wife took 50% of everything he makes.

1380
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:00,760
He's still a fucking billionaire.

1381
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:02,940
It doesn't matter.

1382
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:06,960
Like...

1383
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:08,840
He can spend 98%...

1384
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:09,720
Yeah.

1385
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:10,440
That guy.

1386
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:16,840
He can spend 98% of his entire net worth.

1387
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:22,820
And he'll still die fucking more rich than like 98% of what he makes.

1388
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:28,860
That's just what's shit's like.

1389
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:30,580
Just like...

1390
01:04:30,580 --> 01:04:31,420
Just like shit.

1391
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:33,400
Like a, man.

1392
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:36,320
But.

1393
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:39,440
Like...

1394
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:39,540
Just like shit.

1395
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:42,620
Can nobody fucking todas take that shit off.

1396
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:44,860
Like, he can afford to charge for it if he wants, I don't know.

1397
01:04:44,860 --> 01:04:45,520
This is just awkward.

1398
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:46,180
It's not like it's anymore...

1399
01:04:46,180 --> 01:04:47,280
There.

1400
01:04:50,660 --> 01:04:51,220
You scream.

1401
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:51,400
What do you call shit?

1402
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:51,440
You've got to find other people who...

1403
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:51,520
You've got to find other people who are bullish in the...

1404
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:51,980
We're done for today.

1405
01:04:51,980 --> 01:04:55,480
I like how I went through that entire tangent.

1406
01:04:55,900 --> 01:05:00,900
Anyway, I will rob innocent people if those innocent people were billionaires.

1407
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:07,600
Because they don't care.

1408
01:05:07,940 --> 01:05:09,060
Or millionaires.

1409
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:09,480
You know what?

1410
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:11,120
Millionaires and billionaires.

1411
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:15,380
Because there's some actual innocent millionaires.

1412
01:05:15,380 --> 01:05:22,340
Anyway, this justifies me robbing the rich because they don't care.

1413
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,540
They don't care.

1414
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,280
That's nothing to them.

1415
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:31,520
$350,000 is nothing to a billionaire and a millionaire.

1416
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:34,480
It's just like... it's what they make in one day.

1417
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:37,360
It's literally what they make in one day.

1418
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:39,660
So they'll not even realize it's God.

1419
01:05:41,580 --> 01:05:44,320
It says, innocent, look.

1420
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:48,080
There has to be innocent millionaires in there.

1421
01:05:48,220 --> 01:05:51,980
I believe there's innocent millionaires in there.

1422
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,340
It's so wrong.

1423
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:56,040
Look.

1424
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:56,760
Look.

1425
01:05:56,980 --> 01:05:58,460
If you think about it.

1426
01:05:58,940 --> 01:06:01,540
My wrong turns into a right.

1427
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:09,900
I can literally rob just one innocent millionaire or billionaire.

1428
01:06:10,060 --> 01:06:11,060
And they won't notice.

1429
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:17,780
I'll just rob one of them.

1430
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:19,880
And they won't notice at all.

1431
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:22,320
I'll rob a baby.

1432
01:06:22,540 --> 01:06:24,840
A millionaire's child.

1433
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:27,220
They have to be innocent by then.

1434
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:31,420
Because, you know, it's not their fault if they're super greedy.

1435
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:34,920
It's not the child's fault if they're super spoiled.

1436
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,820
They were just raised to be like that.

1437
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:39,360
So I'll just rob...

1438
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:42,740
I'm pretty sure when the baby is born, they instantly become a millionaire.

1439
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,120
So I'll rob the baby.

1440
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:49,180
And then the billionaire will just give them back the money.

1441
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:50,460
They'll just be like, oh, child.

1442
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:56,280
What if the child is holding a sack of money and it's $350,000?

1443
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:58,600
I'll just steal that sack of money.

1444
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:03,820
And then the millionaire will be like, oh, sweetie, don't cry.

1445
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:07,600
Here's another million dollars for you to fucking sleep on.

1446
01:07:07,660 --> 01:07:08,080
I don't know.

1447
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:08,900
I don't know what they do.

1448
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:10,400
I don't know what those kids do.

1449
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:17,420
So let's... thank you for the super chat.

1450
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:17,760
Thank you.

1451
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:18,300
Thank you.

1452
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:22,480
Are you a point-slope formula because you keep giving us all the tangents?

1453
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:23,660
Thank you for the super chat.

1454
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:24,100
Thank you.

1455
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:24,740
Thank you.

1456
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:32,820
Look, all I'm saying is that it won't be that bad if I, like, steal from one innocent baby.

1457
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:35,180
Because they won't notice it's gone.

1458
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:42,660
They will not notice it's gone.

1459
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:44,100
That's all I'm saying.

1460
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:49,100
All that... those people are... those people are fucking stupid.

1461
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:52,260
They are not thinking at the level I'm thinking right now.

1462
01:07:53,580 --> 01:07:55,960
What the fuck am I gonna do with math?

1463
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:58,620
Sorry, we're not voting on this.

1464
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:01,040
Why would... it be 50-50.

1465
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:03,000
What would you do with math?

1466
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:04,920
You have a phone.

1467
01:08:07,660 --> 01:08:09,580
What... what will help you?

1468
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:11,820
What will help you with math?

1469
01:08:12,020 --> 01:08:14,080
You're gonna fucking calculate the number of...

1470
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:17,480
the time it's gonna take for you to drive from one end to another?

1471
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:19,120
You know what's not gonna help...

1472
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:20,440
You know what else can help you with that?

1473
01:08:20,580 --> 01:08:21,600
Fucking Google Maps.

1474
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:25,380
Learn engineering?

1475
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:27,620
Just don't be an engineer!

1476
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:37,280
If you're... if you're already pursuing engineering as a degree, you don't need to be proficient in math because you're already proficient in math.

1477
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:41,660
I need math to be CiderFat.

1478
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:51,700
Guys, if you're already proficient in math, you're already trying... if you're already trying to be an engineer, you're already proficient in math.

1479
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:54,560
Because why the fuck would you go towards being an engineer?

1480
01:08:56,420 --> 01:08:58,660
How does that make sense?

1481
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:02,480
It... what do you mean how does that make sense?

1482
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:06,340
Taxes... just pay someone to fucking figure out your...

1483
01:09:06,340 --> 01:09:06,740
Oh, wait.

1484
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:10,440
Something... I just realized like... like...

1485
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:13,820
Not a lot of people have the opportunity to do that.

1486
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:15,320
I'm so sorry.

1487
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:20,100
Sorry.

1488
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:21,700
Some people...

1489
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:25,860
Sorry, I have to have someone to do my taxes because I'm like...

1490
01:09:25,860 --> 01:09:29,200
I can't do math and also like... I can afford...

1491
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:40,420
I'm fortunate enough to be able...

1492
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:41,900
to be able...

1493
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:46,620
to... to afford an accountant...

1494
01:09:47,220 --> 01:09:52,040
to afford an accountant to check through my taxes for me.

1495
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:54,720
Okay.

1496
01:09:56,940 --> 01:09:58,740
Celeste, thank you for the super chat.

1497
01:09:58,820 --> 01:09:59,280
Thank you.

1498
01:09:59,300 --> 01:09:59,860
Thank you.

1499
01:10:00,380 --> 01:10:05,100
I'm an engineer and an accountant and a former math teacher and I took that personally.

1500
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:05,920
Thank you for the super chat.

1501
01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:06,180
Thank you.

1502
01:10:06,220 --> 01:10:06,340
Thank you.

1503
01:10:06,340 --> 01:10:09,360
But it's because you're already good at math, Celeste.

1504
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:11,500
You're already good at math.

1505
01:10:11,940 --> 01:10:14,220
You don't need to be proficient.

1506
01:10:14,580 --> 01:10:16,580
You already have that skill.

1507
01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:21,600
You chose that career because you have that skill already.

1508
01:10:22,220 --> 01:10:28,240
There's a reason why I'm not a math teacher or an accountant or an engineer.

1509
01:10:28,620 --> 01:10:30,120
Before I had the...

1510
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:32,880
Before I had the money to afford an accountant.

1511
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:34,500
Do you know who does my taxes?

1512
01:10:34,620 --> 01:10:36,040
Who helps me with my taxes?

1513
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:39,200
My parents because I was so fucking stupid.

1514
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,900
I am still very stupid.

1515
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:44,080
I'm so...

1516
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:47,520
I don't want to trust me with numbers.

1517
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:50,800
Because I don't trust myself with numbers.

1518
01:10:51,420 --> 01:10:53,020
I'm just that dumb.

1519
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:59,920
I just need you guys to know when I did the IB program, when I did the international baccalaureate.

1520
01:11:01,380 --> 01:11:04,660
You have to like do suggestions and stuff.

1521
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:07,440
Like you have to give like what classes are you going to take.

1522
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:08,240
For those who don't know.

1523
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:11,180
The international baccalaureate is one of the hard...

1524
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:12,140
I don't know if it still is.

1525
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:14,760
But back when I took the international baccalaureate.

1526
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:18,460
It's one of the hardest courses you can take in high school.

1527
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:21,680
So like if you pass the IB program.

1528
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:25,220
It's basically like a higher tier than AP.

1529
01:11:25,540 --> 01:11:27,040
So it's like a higher...

1530
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:30,280
It's like one of the highest tiers for like school.

1531
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:31,160
Like for schooling.

1532
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:34,040
And if you pass it.

1533
01:11:34,180 --> 01:11:37,680
If you pass the IB program.

1534
01:11:39,820 --> 01:11:42,920
You basically you can get college credit for free.

1535
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:46,460
Like you can get like bonus college credit.

1536
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:50,100
So you can like graduate like one to two years early.

1537
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:51,020
Basically.

1538
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:52,940
So I did the IB program.

1539
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:55,080
And I passed the IB program.

1540
01:11:55,220 --> 01:11:56,280
And I got like college credit.

1541
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:57,100
So I could graduate early.

1542
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:58,500
But if you can...

1543
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:00,760
If you get like really good scores.

1544
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:05,420
It's like almost guarantee IB league.

1545
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:07,080
Unless you fail the interview.

1546
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:08,380
Because we had...

1547
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:09,780
I remember there was like a student.

1548
01:12:10,060 --> 01:12:11,300
Like she was...

1549
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:13,600
Oh I told this story a long time ago.

1550
01:12:13,820 --> 01:12:15,620
But there was this girl.

1551
01:12:15,660 --> 01:12:16,440
I know.

1552
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:18,780
In the IB program.

1553
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:23,380
And like a lot of people were like scared of her.

1554
01:12:23,620 --> 01:12:25,560
Because she would wear like a fanning pack.

1555
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:28,980
She would wear like a fanning pack around.

1556
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:33,200
And like she had like knives in that fanning pack.

1557
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:34,200
Like...

1558
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:41,700
And like her...

1559
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:45,820
Like she would say like her dream is to be a Yandere.

1560
01:12:50,940 --> 01:12:53,900
She would be like I want to be a Yandere.

1561
01:12:54,140 --> 01:12:55,420
To us.

1562
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:57,580
Because like I hang out with her.

1563
01:12:57,740 --> 01:12:58,680
And like other...

1564
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:00,820
She was like in the group I hang out with.

1565
01:13:01,580 --> 01:13:03,040
I didn't want to piss...

1566
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:03,400
I didn't...

1567
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:05,080
Like I wanted to be her friend.

1568
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:06,520
Because she was like...

1569
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:09,540
She's like incredibly smart.

1570
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:12,300
And I didn't want to piss her off.

1571
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:17,700
Because one of my friends told me that someone like pissed her off.

1572
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:18,600
One time.

1573
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:20,860
Like before like I became friends with her.

1574
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:23,920
Like one of my other friends told me.

1575
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,060
Was like don't piss her off.

1576
01:13:26,140 --> 01:13:29,080
Because she got suspended once because she pulled a knife on somebody.

1577
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:30,280
And I was like...

1578
01:13:34,460 --> 01:13:35,500
And so...

1579
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:36,740
So I was like...

1580
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:37,800
Gotcha.

1581
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:40,040
I'm gonna be good friends with her.

1582
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:46,100
Okay.

1583
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:48,400
Anyway.

1584
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:50,160
Anyway.

1585
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:52,700
So...

1586
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:53,620
So...

1587
01:13:53,620 --> 01:13:54,180
But anyways.

1588
01:13:54,260 --> 01:13:57,200
She got a perfect score in the IB program.

1589
01:13:57,740 --> 01:13:59,220
Like she got like a...

1590
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:02,680
Full marks basically in IB.

1591
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,480
Like which is like really really...

1592
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:06,480
Fucking good.

1593
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:09,600
Like it's like almost impossible to get.

1594
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:10,800
Like it's almost like...

1595
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:12,840
It's very very...

1596
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:13,860
It's like the 1%.

1597
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:17,600
It's basically the 1% to get a perfect score.

1598
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:18,700
Like the perfect 45.

1599
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:20,320
And she got that.

1600
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:22,780
And her first choice...

1601
01:14:22,780 --> 01:14:25,660
Her first choice was Harvard.

1602
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:28,360
And...

1603
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:32,300
And she got waitlisted from Harvard.

1604
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:33,740
Because of her interview.

1605
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:37,520
And she got like a perfect score.

1606
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:38,100
Because usually...

1607
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:40,560
When you get a perfect score...

1608
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:41,540
That...

1609
01:14:41,540 --> 01:14:43,840
When you get a perfect score...

1610
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:44,680
Uh...

1611
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:45,360
You...

1612
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:47,360
It's almost guaranteed...

1613
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:48,280
IB...

1614
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:50,460
Like guaranteed first choice pick...

1615
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:51,800
In any IB league school.

1616
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:54,780
Because it's that difficult to get in.

1617
01:14:55,020 --> 01:14:57,180
But because like...

1618
01:14:57,180 --> 01:14:59,200
She was very intimidating.

1619
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:00,820
I'll just say she was like...

1620
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:03,420
Incredibly intimidating in person.

1621
01:15:03,820 --> 01:15:04,460
Uh...

1622
01:15:05,900 --> 01:15:07,940
No she did not get into Harvard.

1623
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:09,860
She got into...

1624
01:15:10,460 --> 01:15:11,320
What is that...

1625
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:11,620
MIT.

1626
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:13,100
She got into MIT.

1627
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:14,840
Uh...

1628
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:16,040
Because she wanted to be an engineer.

1629
01:15:16,380 --> 01:15:17,220
So like...

1630
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:19,920
She chose MIT after getting waitlisted to Harvard.

1631
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:21,500
Uh...

1632
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:25,560
Anyway...

1633
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:27,000
Anyway...

1634
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,220
That was not the story...

1635
01:15:29,220 --> 01:15:31,180
My story was that...

1636
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:33,360
My story...

1637
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:40,280
The story was that basically when you're supposed to give your class choices, there's like three levels of math.

1638
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:44,320
It's standard level, higher level, or baby level.

1639
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:44,740
Studies.

1640
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:45,600
Math studies.

1641
01:15:45,940 --> 01:15:48,180
Math studies is like baby level math.

1642
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:52,500
And then there's standard level and then there's higher level.

1643
01:15:53,840 --> 01:16:00,460
The counselor, the academic counselor was like, I think Doki should do studies.

1644
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:07,980
After I put standard level, I put standard level.

1645
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:12,100
But the counselor looked at my list and was like, you should do studies.

1646
01:16:12,620 --> 01:16:16,700
And then I told my parents that.

1647
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:19,300
They're like, oh they want me to do math studies.

1648
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:24,720
And then my parents were mad and was like, she is not doing math studies.

1649
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:28,720
We will get her tutors so she can do standard.

1650
01:16:29,380 --> 01:16:33,340
She will have math tutors almost every other day.

1651
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:35,980
So she can do standard level.

1652
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:38,220
So then the counselor was like, okay.

1653
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:44,420
The reason why was because they were afraid.

1654
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:50,340
The counselor was afraid that if I...

1655
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:57,760
Because the reason why is because the school was one of those things where obviously the grades really mattered.

1656
01:16:57,860 --> 01:17:02,340
Because they always post out like, oh our school got the average rating.

1657
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:03,340
The average.

1658
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:05,480
Like IB score is this.

1659
01:17:05,660 --> 01:17:08,640
So they try to convince a lot of like...

1660
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:15,200
They try to convince people who they think are too dumb to take IB to do the lower rank pro...

1661
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:16,520
To do the other program.

1662
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:23,040
Because they don't want them to affect the average IB score that the school has.

1663
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:24,840
So they'll be like...

1664
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:28,520
They'll be like, oh we don't think you should take IB.

1665
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:30,740
You should take that one instead.

1666
01:17:30,820 --> 01:17:32,940
It will be so much better for you.

1667
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:38,160
So they don't want them to like affect the average.

1668
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:40,580
They don't want them to bring the average down.

1669
01:17:41,140 --> 01:17:44,100
Like they were trying to tamper the stats and stuff.

1670
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:48,120
So that's why they were like, we think Doki should take studies.

1671
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:48,760
So...

1672
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:50,680
Because they were afraid.

1673
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:57,760
They were afraid that my math score was going to lower the fucking IB score.

1674
01:17:58,020 --> 01:17:59,380
They were so scared.

1675
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:02,920
So they were trying to convince my parents and I to take studies.

1676
01:18:04,420 --> 01:18:04,900
Anyway...

1677
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:06,720
Anyway...

1678
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:08,080
That is why...

1679
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:11,240
This entire tangent is why...

1680
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:16,280
Is why I was not born to do math.

1681
01:18:16,940 --> 01:18:17,760
That is...

1682
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:18,740
That's basically it.

1683
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:20,700
This took me like 20 minutes to explain.

1684
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:22,560
But that was the story.

1685
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:25,340
I should not be in charge of anything math related.

1686
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:30,120
It got to the point where even the counselor was like, I don't think she should be in this level.

1687
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:37,860
Anyway...

1688
01:18:37,860 --> 01:18:39,380
Would you rather...

1689
01:18:39,380 --> 01:18:41,120
Sorry, we were supposed to...

1690
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:42,320
I think they were...

1691
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:43,640
They were, they were 100...

1692
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:45,900
I was so down to do math studies by the way.

1693
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,420
But it was all an ego thing for my parents.

1694
01:18:48,620 --> 01:18:50,820
Because they didn't want a child to do math studies.

1695
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:52,880
Cause like, that's a little...

1696
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:54,380
I guess that's a little embarrassing.

1697
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:57,560
Because everybody else is like standard level.

1698
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:59,040
And then like...

1699
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:01,120
Me, I would be in the studies level.

1700
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:02,220
Which is basically...

1701
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:04,680
I'm being like, she can't do fucking math.

1702
01:19:12,580 --> 01:19:14,820
Okay, be able to walk on water.

1703
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:15,900
Okay, obviously fire.

1704
01:19:16,020 --> 01:19:16,780
We don't even need a pool.

1705
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:19,600
You all know my opinion about the water.

1706
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:22,800
Like why the fuck would I need a... bro, what the fuck?

1707
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:26,440
I'd rather just like... okay.

1708
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:27,580
Water?

1709
01:19:28,420 --> 01:19:30,740
I'll just have like a fucking... what's it called?

1710
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:31,840
Those little lifesavers?

1711
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:35,000
I'll just put on those little lifesavers or those life jackets.

1712
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:36,520
Why do I need that?

1713
01:19:36,980 --> 01:19:38,420
I could just touch fire?

1714
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:40,440
You need so much protection for fire.

1715
01:19:40,860 --> 01:19:43,260
So like you need to have so much protection.

1716
01:19:43,740 --> 01:19:47,300
And like... and like what if somebody's drowning?

1717
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:48,780
What can I do?

1718
01:19:49,140 --> 01:19:52,860
I can't go in the water and like fucking save them.

1719
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:57,460
But if somebody is like on fire... if a building is on fire...

1720
01:19:57,460 --> 01:19:57,560
I can't go in the water and like fucking save them.

1721
01:19:57,560 --> 01:20:00,300
And then there's no firefighters around and I'm walking around.

1722
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:02,020
And then there's buildings on fire.

1723
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:04,140
I can go in and save the person.

1724
01:20:04,460 --> 01:20:08,840
I can literally run into the building and save whoever's in that building.

1725
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:10,240
And be a hero.

1726
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:13,120
If somebody's drowning, they still drown.

1727
01:20:16,980 --> 01:20:18,460
They'll still fucking drown.

1728
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:19,460
What can I do?

1729
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:21,720
Watch them drown at a closer spot?

1730
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:27,520
That's easy.

1731
01:20:31,380 --> 01:20:34,280
Fire also... okay we're not talking about the oxygen here.

1732
01:20:34,420 --> 01:20:37,580
Maybe they're like you know... what if they're just like in the...

1733
01:20:37,580 --> 01:20:41,160
I just like get like do like the movies because movies are so accurate.

1734
01:20:41,540 --> 01:20:45,740
I'll just get like a shirt and then like cover my my face like this.

1735
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:47,520
And then I'll be fine.

1736
01:20:47,660 --> 01:20:49,480
The oxygen... the fire won't kill me.

1737
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:50,920
I can breathe through my shirt.

1738
01:20:53,300 --> 01:20:54,540
Just like the movies.

1739
01:20:57,640 --> 01:20:59,880
Why would more people want to... what do you want to be?

1740
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:00,320
Jesus?

1741
01:21:00,980 --> 01:21:04,760
Why the fuck would more people like want to walk on water?

1742
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:07,540
They just want to be Jesus or something?

1743
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:08,720
Oh my god.

1744
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:11,640
I wouldn't be scared about like oil burns.

1745
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,760
Because like that's like a mini fire.

1746
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:15,960
What the fuck?

1747
01:21:20,060 --> 01:21:22,060
What are these questions?

1748
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:30,320
This is just uncomfortable.

1749
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:32,120
I feel like...

1750
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:34,980
For like anybody this is just uncomfortable.

1751
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:40,660
No!

1752
01:21:40,660 --> 01:21:42,120
No legit though.

1753
01:21:42,660 --> 01:21:45,800
That is... that is just incredibly uncomfortable.

1754
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:47,980
Like why the fuck would you want that?

1755
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:52,620
Like what if you're like... what if you're like having dinner with your parents?

1756
01:21:57,880 --> 01:22:00,120
Bro this would fucking... you know what?

1757
01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:01,180
Okay I'm actually curious.

1758
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:03,440
I'm actually curious.

1759
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:04,500
I know my answer.

1760
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:08,940
Because like what is just incredibly uncomfortable in general.

1761
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:11,240
Arouse versus no.

1762
01:22:11,980 --> 01:22:12,700
Okay.

1763
01:22:20,650 --> 01:22:25,970
Like what is chat... I want to know what is chat's answer to this.

1764
01:22:26,190 --> 01:22:29,650
One is just... no one is not just puberty.

1765
01:22:30,130 --> 01:22:32,490
Like cause like there's resting points.

1766
01:22:32,490 --> 01:22:36,130
I would assume that like you've rested.

1767
01:22:37,150 --> 01:22:39,050
There's like rest points.

1768
01:22:39,550 --> 01:22:41,290
Like there's no way.

1769
01:22:41,570 --> 01:22:42,930
This is always.

1770
01:22:47,030 --> 01:22:49,970
Like you would have... there's no resting.

1771
01:22:50,270 --> 01:22:51,530
It's just always.

1772
01:22:51,890 --> 01:22:53,330
What if you're at a funeral?

1773
01:22:54,110 --> 01:22:56,030
What if you're at a funeral chat?

1774
01:22:56,410 --> 01:22:58,170
What if you're at a fucking funeral?

1775
01:22:58,490 --> 01:23:02,470
And then you're... you have to like you know go see the fucking dead man.

1776
01:23:02,470 --> 01:23:06,050
And then you know people are gonna be like whoa.

1777
01:23:06,270 --> 01:23:09,170
Are you tell everybody at the funeral place?

1778
01:23:09,450 --> 01:23:12,630
Like at the funeral be like sorry I have a condition.

1779
01:23:12,950 --> 01:23:14,810
Where I'm always like you know.

1780
01:23:17,050 --> 01:23:19,530
So people be like oh my god.

1781
01:23:19,910 --> 01:23:22,170
That's auntie blah blah blah.

1782
01:23:22,290 --> 01:23:23,170
How could you?

1783
01:23:23,550 --> 01:23:25,370
Like are you telling everybody that?

1784
01:23:25,530 --> 01:23:27,250
So people won't be like whoa.

1785
01:23:27,550 --> 01:23:30,530
Why the fuck is go... what is going on?

1786
01:23:31,170 --> 01:23:31,770
Like...

1787
01:23:34,130 --> 01:23:35,330
I just won't go.

1788
01:23:35,490 --> 01:23:37,390
What if you're like at a will reading?

1789
01:23:37,670 --> 01:23:40,190
You have to do... in order to obtain whatever...

1790
01:23:40,190 --> 01:23:40,950
Okay that's not true.

1791
01:23:41,030 --> 01:23:42,510
You can actually... you don't need to...

1792
01:23:42,510 --> 01:23:46,210
You don't need to go to the will reading to like get what you want from the will.

1793
01:23:46,510 --> 01:23:48,670
But like you cannot...

1794
01:23:48,670 --> 01:23:50,090
You cannot always.

1795
01:23:50,370 --> 01:23:54,430
Like I don't understand why the poll is so close.

1796
01:23:54,650 --> 01:23:56,470
It should not be like 54%.

1797
01:23:57,030 --> 01:23:59,730
No there should be more of you guys who agree with me.

1798
01:24:00,070 --> 01:24:01,910
Like bros thank you for the super chat.

1799
01:24:01,910 --> 01:24:02,830
Thank you thank you.

1800
01:24:02,850 --> 01:24:03,270
It happens.

1801
01:24:03,650 --> 01:24:05,050
Thank you for the super chat.

1802
01:24:05,190 --> 01:24:09,330
Thank you thank you.

1803
01:24:10,870 --> 01:24:12,250
Croak thank you for the super chat.

1804
01:24:12,410 --> 01:24:13,390
Croak thank you for the super chat.

1805
01:24:13,470 --> 01:24:14,170
Thank you thank you.

1806
01:24:14,210 --> 01:24:18,270
You can hide around some place at the time.

1807
01:24:19,170 --> 01:24:20,870
Thank you for the super chat.

1808
01:24:21,010 --> 01:24:22,190
Thank you thank you.

1809
01:24:22,470 --> 01:24:26,910
That guy seems to be talking with a lot of experience there.

1810
01:24:30,830 --> 01:24:31,410
Alright.

1811
01:24:32,130 --> 01:24:34,650
How is there... how did it fall down?

1812
01:24:35,390 --> 01:24:38,970
How did the fucking percentage fall down?

1813
01:24:41,610 --> 01:24:42,190
Alright.

1814
01:24:42,490 --> 01:24:44,090
I'm gonna go with two.

1815
01:24:44,230 --> 01:24:45,490
This is just not it.

1816
01:24:46,630 --> 01:24:48,590
I swear... why?

1817
01:24:51,130 --> 01:24:54,150
You can never fucking go near a pool ever again.

1818
01:24:54,170 --> 01:24:56,890
You can never go near playgrounds.

1819
01:24:56,890 --> 01:24:57,630
Ever again.

1820
01:24:57,850 --> 01:24:58,950
Or like live anywhere.

1821
01:24:59,610 --> 01:25:02,470
Like you can never like go anywhere.

1822
01:25:02,810 --> 01:25:04,970
That's... go anywhere.

1823
01:25:05,190 --> 01:25:06,830
It would be so bad for you.

1824
01:25:08,550 --> 01:25:09,630
So bad.

1825
01:25:14,570 --> 01:25:15,890
It's so bad.

1826
01:25:19,090 --> 01:25:19,810
Okay.

1827
01:25:27,150 --> 01:25:27,830
Alright.

1828
01:25:27,910 --> 01:25:29,090
Be an elder sibling.

1829
01:25:29,290 --> 01:25:30,570
Be a younger sibling.

1830
01:25:30,970 --> 01:25:33,970
I feel like younger is the best option.

1831
01:25:34,250 --> 01:25:36,250
Because I'm an only child.

1832
01:25:36,610 --> 01:25:39,190
I'm an... I'm an only child.

1833
01:25:39,450 --> 01:25:45,070
And like... and like I don't know what it's like to be either of these.

1834
01:25:45,270 --> 01:25:48,090
But from movies and TV shows.

1835
01:25:48,350 --> 01:25:49,990
You know because they're always accurate.

1836
01:25:53,110 --> 01:25:56,870
I feel like the eldest sibling is like...

1837
01:25:56,890 --> 01:25:58,810
The... the guinea pig.

1838
01:25:59,030 --> 01:25:59,570
You know?

1839
01:25:59,710 --> 01:26:02,470
Where they test out what works and what doesn't work.

1840
01:26:02,730 --> 01:26:04,350
And then like you know...

1841
01:26:04,350 --> 01:26:05,230
When they're like...

1842
01:26:05,230 --> 01:26:05,790
Oh shit.

1843
01:26:05,990 --> 01:26:07,050
That doesn't work.

1844
01:26:07,310 --> 01:26:09,410
I won't be doing that to the younger sibling.

1845
01:26:09,850 --> 01:26:10,690
So like...

1846
01:26:10,690 --> 01:26:11,790
Obviously all the...

1847
01:26:11,790 --> 01:26:15,490
If they try to do some stuff that clearly didn't work and cause trauma.

1848
01:26:15,710 --> 01:26:16,850
For the elder sibling.

1849
01:26:18,630 --> 01:26:19,350
The younger...

1850
01:26:19,350 --> 01:26:21,410
They learn that for the younger sibling.

1851
01:26:22,850 --> 01:26:24,030
They'll be like...

1852
01:26:24,030 --> 01:26:24,410
Oh...

1853
01:26:24,410 --> 01:26:26,350
Yeah it's like the older sibling would be like...

1854
01:26:26,350 --> 01:26:26,950
The trial run.

1855
01:26:27,030 --> 01:26:27,690
The test child.

1856
01:26:27,990 --> 01:26:30,030
And then the next one would be like...

1857
01:26:30,030 --> 01:26:31,230
Okay we realized what worked.

1858
01:26:31,430 --> 01:26:32,530
And what didn't work.

1859
01:26:32,750 --> 01:26:33,770
So we're gonna...

1860
01:26:33,770 --> 01:26:35,190
We're gonna like...

1861
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:36,530
Try not to do that.

1862
01:26:36,890 --> 01:26:37,350
And then...

1863
01:26:37,350 --> 01:26:38,470
But you wanna be the youngest.

1864
01:26:39,750 --> 01:26:40,710
Because obviously...

1865
01:26:40,710 --> 01:26:41,370
They'll be like...

1866
01:26:42,690 --> 01:26:43,990
The second child.

1867
01:26:44,210 --> 01:26:44,610
They'll be like...

1868
01:26:44,610 --> 01:26:45,650
Alright that didn't work.

1869
01:26:45,770 --> 01:26:46,290
They're like...

1870
01:26:46,290 --> 01:26:50,670
The second child is where you test out the theories to see if it was true.

1871
01:26:50,910 --> 01:26:51,690
So like...

1872
01:26:53,010 --> 01:26:53,490
Hahaha...

1873
01:26:53,490 --> 01:26:53,530
Hahaha...

1874
01:26:54,430 --> 01:26:54,910
Hahaha...

1875
01:26:54,910 --> 01:26:55,130
Hahaha...

1876
01:26:56,390 --> 01:26:56,950
So...

1877
01:26:56,950 --> 01:27:00,930
So you test out the theories that you tried out on the eldest.

1878
01:27:01,330 --> 01:27:02,730
And then you try to be like...

1879
01:27:02,730 --> 01:27:03,350
Okay...

1880
01:27:03,350 --> 01:27:04,410
The middle child.

1881
01:27:04,670 --> 01:27:05,410
Middle child.

1882
01:27:05,470 --> 01:27:07,190
We're gonna try all these other theories.

1883
01:27:07,290 --> 01:27:08,390
And see what worked.

1884
01:27:08,430 --> 01:27:09,950
What is definitely working or not.

1885
01:27:10,190 --> 01:27:11,410
And then finally...

1886
01:27:11,410 --> 01:27:14,030
The third child is where they're like...

1887
01:27:14,030 --> 01:27:14,890
We perfected it.

1888
01:27:18,310 --> 01:27:20,970
The third child would be like...

1889
01:27:20,970 --> 01:27:24,050
Where you perfect the whole raising kids thing.

1890
01:27:24,050 --> 01:27:25,170
And was like...

1891
01:27:25,170 --> 01:27:26,290
We figured it out.

1892
01:27:26,350 --> 01:27:26,790
For real.

1893
01:27:28,090 --> 01:27:28,670
Hahaha...

1894
01:27:30,930 --> 01:27:31,510
Hahaha...

1895
01:27:31,510 --> 01:27:32,190
So...

1896
01:27:32,190 --> 01:27:34,010
Middle child has to be the worst.

1897
01:27:34,090 --> 01:27:34,790
I feel like.

1898
01:27:34,970 --> 01:27:35,770
Cause then...

1899
01:27:35,770 --> 01:27:37,170
The eldest obviously...

1900
01:27:37,170 --> 01:27:37,410
You know...

1901
01:27:37,410 --> 01:27:38,130
They were born first.

1902
01:27:38,430 --> 01:27:39,830
And then the youngest...

1903
01:27:39,830 --> 01:27:40,630
They are like...

1904
01:27:40,630 --> 01:27:40,850
Ooh...

1905
01:27:40,850 --> 01:27:41,890
I'm gonna spoil you.

1906
01:27:41,990 --> 01:27:43,210
Cause you're the youngest now.

1907
01:27:43,730 --> 01:27:44,310
And...

1908
01:27:44,310 --> 01:27:45,970
So I would say youngest.

1909
01:27:46,270 --> 01:27:47,990
Also the reason why...

1910
01:27:47,990 --> 01:27:49,410
The younger sibling...

1911
01:27:49,410 --> 01:27:50,890
It's because like...

1912
01:27:50,890 --> 01:27:52,950
The older your siblings are...

1913
01:27:52,950 --> 01:27:54,030
The more likely they are to be the youngest.

1914
01:27:54,030 --> 01:27:55,450
The more likely they are gonna get married.

1915
01:27:55,710 --> 01:27:57,170
So when they get married.

1916
01:27:57,370 --> 01:27:58,710
They have to give you...

1917
01:27:58,710 --> 01:28:00,130
The unmarried person.

1918
01:28:00,390 --> 01:28:01,490
Red pocket money.

1919
01:28:01,850 --> 01:28:03,630
So then if you're the youngest...

1920
01:28:03,630 --> 01:28:05,750
The eldest has to give you money.

1921
01:28:06,230 --> 01:28:07,330
Cause they get married.

1922
01:28:11,710 --> 01:28:13,630
Just think of it that way.

1923
01:28:16,890 --> 01:28:17,450
True...

1924
01:28:17,450 --> 01:28:19,410
Not the red pocket.

1925
01:28:22,050 --> 01:28:23,690
Just think of it that way.

1926
01:28:23,750 --> 01:28:24,010
Cause you're the youngest.

1927
01:28:24,010 --> 01:28:28,430
Because the eldest will eventually have to get married.

1928
01:28:28,710 --> 01:28:30,430
I like how someone is like, girl I'm white.

1929
01:28:33,410 --> 01:28:36,010
This only applies to certain people.

1930
01:28:36,350 --> 01:28:36,930
I'm sorry.

1931
01:28:39,550 --> 01:28:43,530
Anyway, I feel like being the youngest sibling is the best option.

1932
01:28:45,650 --> 01:28:46,290
Let's see.

1933
01:28:47,250 --> 01:28:49,270
Thank you for the super chat.

1934
01:28:49,350 --> 01:28:49,610
Thank you.

1935
01:28:49,650 --> 01:28:50,090
Thank you.

1936
01:28:50,090 --> 01:28:50,690
Can confirm.

1937
01:28:50,910 --> 01:28:54,070
As the eldest of six, oldest kid is the test drive model.

1938
01:28:54,570 --> 01:28:55,970
Youngest is pampered and spoiled.

1939
01:28:56,290 --> 01:28:57,290
Middle kids are normal.

1940
01:28:57,550 --> 01:28:58,350
Thank you for the super chat.

1941
01:28:58,450 --> 01:28:58,670
Thank you.

1942
01:28:58,710 --> 01:28:59,070
Thank you.

1943
01:28:59,070 --> 01:28:59,350
Gia!

1944
01:28:59,550 --> 01:29:00,450
Thank you for the super chat.

1945
01:29:00,510 --> 01:29:00,750
Thank you.

1946
01:29:00,770 --> 01:29:01,190
Thank you.

1947
01:29:01,210 --> 01:29:05,110
As an elder sibling, you get to form the rules based on what works for you.

1948
01:29:05,310 --> 01:29:07,250
If you play your cards right.

1949
01:29:07,370 --> 01:29:08,650
Thank you for the super chat.

1950
01:29:08,770 --> 01:29:09,070
Thank you.

1951
01:29:09,090 --> 01:29:09,630
Thank you.

1952
01:29:09,890 --> 01:29:11,450
Anyway, I'm gonna be the younger sibling.

1953
01:29:11,690 --> 01:29:13,470
I didn't make a poll for this because I thought...

1954
01:29:13,470 --> 01:29:14,450
Oh my god!

1955
01:29:14,490 --> 01:29:15,750
It was a 50-50!

1956
01:29:17,230 --> 01:29:17,890
People who...

1957
01:29:18,250 --> 01:29:19,830
People who are on the fence were only...

1958
01:29:19,830 --> 01:29:22,430
were only challenged so they couldn't think as smart as I did.

1959
01:29:22,670 --> 01:29:24,270
Lose your sense of touch.

1960
01:29:24,390 --> 01:29:25,990
Lose your sense of sight.

1961
01:29:26,750 --> 01:29:28,290
I would lose my... No.

1962
01:29:28,470 --> 01:29:29,070
Oh my god.

1963
01:29:29,110 --> 01:29:29,850
This is actually...

1964
01:29:29,850 --> 01:29:30,730
This is difficult.

1965
01:29:31,510 --> 01:29:33,590
This is actually difficult.

1966
01:29:34,130 --> 01:29:37,250
No touch versus no sight.

1967
01:29:39,830 --> 01:29:42,170
I swear this song has been playing on repeat.

1968
01:29:42,490 --> 01:29:45,650
Like I'm going crazy right now.

1969
01:29:46,130 --> 01:29:46,690
Like...

1970
01:29:47,510 --> 01:29:48,890
This is... I swear.

1971
01:29:48,890 --> 01:29:52,550
This song has been playing for like 16 minutes.

1972
01:29:56,130 --> 01:29:57,670
I'm skipping this.

1973
01:29:57,790 --> 01:30:01,310
I was like, I swear I've been listening to this BGM for 16...

1974
01:30:01,310 --> 01:30:02,550
For like forever.

1975
01:30:05,490 --> 01:30:07,350
Oh my god.

1976
01:30:11,710 --> 01:30:12,550
Let's see.

1977
01:30:15,170 --> 01:30:15,810
Alright.

1978
01:30:17,860 --> 01:30:20,270
Lose your sense of touch or sight.

1979
01:30:20,430 --> 01:30:21,570
That's actually really difficult.

1980
01:30:22,450 --> 01:30:23,310
I don't know.

1981
01:30:25,410 --> 01:30:29,010
I'm thinking like what are like the benefits for either or.

1982
01:30:31,710 --> 01:30:33,690
Both of these are awful.

1983
01:30:33,950 --> 01:30:35,670
Yeah, they are all pretty fucking bad.

1984
01:30:35,950 --> 01:30:37,250
That's why I was like, I don't know.

1985
01:30:37,570 --> 01:30:38,870
They're all fucking terrible.

1986
01:30:40,850 --> 01:30:41,390
Oh.

1987
01:30:45,250 --> 01:30:45,790
Yeah.

1988
01:30:45,790 --> 01:30:47,490
They're all pretty fucking bad.

1989
01:30:48,470 --> 01:30:50,450
So it's such a difficult choice.

1990
01:30:51,970 --> 01:30:53,510
I feel like... okay.

1991
01:30:55,710 --> 01:30:57,270
No touch means you...

1992
01:30:57,270 --> 01:30:58,530
bang up your bod.

1993
01:30:58,590 --> 01:30:59,150
That's true.

1994
01:30:59,350 --> 01:31:00,090
That's true.

1995
01:31:00,190 --> 01:31:02,850
No one believed this story when I first told it.

1996
01:31:03,030 --> 01:31:03,930
But like...

1997
01:31:04,450 --> 01:31:06,710
There's like this girl in the UK...

1998
01:31:06,710 --> 01:31:08,910
who doesn't feel anything.

1999
01:31:09,650 --> 01:31:11,770
She doesn't feel anything at all.

2000
01:31:11,830 --> 01:31:12,570
She's like a kid.

2001
01:31:12,790 --> 01:31:14,810
So like she doesn't feel anything at all.

2002
01:31:14,810 --> 01:31:16,710
So and then like the thing is...

2003
01:31:16,710 --> 01:31:19,310
You know, she gets hurt a lot.

2004
01:31:19,370 --> 01:31:21,110
She gets hurt a lot because... but she doesn't feel anything.

2005
01:31:21,290 --> 01:31:25,930
So she has... she's always like getting hurt and stuff, but she doesn't feel anything because she doesn't feel pain.

2006
01:31:26,710 --> 01:31:28,210
Oh my god, Jonathan.

2007
01:31:28,430 --> 01:31:30,050
Thank you for the super chat.

2008
01:31:30,130 --> 01:31:30,490
Thank you.

2009
01:31:33,350 --> 01:31:39,530
But like... but the thing... the good side about that is that she can survive getting hit by a car.

2010
01:31:40,410 --> 01:31:41,210
Because... okay.

2011
01:31:41,270 --> 01:31:44,330
It depends on like the speed of the car, but...

2012
01:31:45,510 --> 01:31:47,830
But there was a story with her.

2013
01:31:48,010 --> 01:31:49,050
She survived.

2014
01:31:49,370 --> 01:31:53,170
She didn't get injured from getting hit by a car.

2015
01:31:53,490 --> 01:31:55,550
Because she doesn't feel anything.

2016
01:31:55,630 --> 01:31:58,710
So she doesn't tense up because she has zero fear.

2017
01:31:58,970 --> 01:32:02,310
She has zero fear because she doesn't feel anything.

2018
01:32:04,830 --> 01:32:05,430
So...

2019
01:32:06,950 --> 01:32:14,570
She wouldn't... she got hit by a car and because she didn't tense up or anything and her muscles were like super relaxed.

2020
01:32:15,370 --> 01:32:17,330
Um, she didn't break anything.

2021
01:32:17,450 --> 01:32:19,390
She had no broken bones or anything.

2022
01:32:19,510 --> 01:32:22,790
I bet she got like... like her knees were scraped and stuff.

2023
01:32:24,130 --> 01:32:26,590
Her knees were scraped and everything.

2024
01:32:27,030 --> 01:32:28,890
So she...

2025
01:32:30,910 --> 01:32:33,810
So it was like... it was so fucking crazy.

2026
01:32:34,090 --> 01:32:38,250
And by the way, she got hit by a car in front of her family.

2027
01:32:38,630 --> 01:32:40,470
Like that's so...

2028
01:32:40,470 --> 01:32:44,250
Imagine being a family that watched that happen.

2029
01:32:44,810 --> 01:32:49,490
She like... with the... in front of like her mom and her siblings.

2030
01:32:50,070 --> 01:32:51,790
And she got hit by a car.

2031
01:32:52,130 --> 01:32:54,030
And they're like, oh my god.

2032
01:32:54,130 --> 01:32:56,270
And then she just got up and like walked up to her mom.

2033
01:32:56,310 --> 01:32:56,810
And was like, yay!

2034
01:32:57,150 --> 01:32:58,690
I was like, holy fuck.

2035
01:32:58,730 --> 01:33:00,550
That is trauma right there.

2036
01:33:02,510 --> 01:33:05,130
She got up after getting hit by a car.

2037
01:33:05,370 --> 01:33:06,470
Walked up to her mom.

2038
01:33:06,710 --> 01:33:07,850
It was like, yay.

2039
01:33:12,790 --> 01:33:14,670
It was like a fucking...

2040
01:33:14,670 --> 01:33:14,790
It was like a fucking...

2041
01:33:14,810 --> 01:33:16,410
It was like a video interview about it.

2042
01:33:16,430 --> 01:33:18,710
And the mom... you could tell the mom was just...

2043
01:33:19,250 --> 01:33:21,110
You could tell the mom...

2044
01:33:21,550 --> 01:33:23,670
She's going through some stuff right now.

2045
01:33:23,890 --> 01:33:24,970
From that interview.

2046
01:33:26,210 --> 01:33:26,650
Um...

2047
01:33:27,430 --> 01:33:29,190
Potato, thank you for the super chat.

2048
01:33:29,310 --> 01:33:29,630
Thank you.

2049
01:33:29,650 --> 01:33:30,230
Thank you.

2050
01:33:30,830 --> 01:33:32,870
No touch piece, no love life.

2051
01:33:33,050 --> 01:33:33,830
Thank you for the super chat.

2052
01:33:33,910 --> 01:33:34,150
Thank you.

2053
01:33:34,170 --> 01:33:34,630
Thank you.

2054
01:33:36,090 --> 01:33:37,570
I feel like...

2055
01:33:37,570 --> 01:33:38,330
I don't know.

2056
01:33:38,770 --> 01:33:40,110
I guess like... I don't...

2057
01:33:40,110 --> 01:33:43,570
Do I really wanna... I don't know.

2058
01:33:43,570 --> 01:33:44,990
Like, I guess...

2059
01:33:45,570 --> 01:33:46,330
I don't know.

2060
01:33:46,390 --> 01:33:47,130
I feel like...

2061
01:33:47,130 --> 01:33:49,530
If I can't see, I can't play video games.

2062
01:33:50,330 --> 01:33:50,890
So...

2063
01:33:50,890 --> 01:33:52,330
I think like...

2064
01:33:56,290 --> 01:33:56,850
How...

2065
01:33:56,850 --> 01:33:59,790
How would I... How would I play video games?

2066
01:34:00,110 --> 01:34:00,670
Though...

2067
01:34:01,450 --> 01:34:02,710
So... I don't know.

2068
01:34:02,770 --> 01:34:03,410
I feel like...

2069
01:34:03,410 --> 01:34:05,110
I rather lose my sense of touch.

2070
01:34:05,470 --> 01:34:07,550
You can... Yeah, but like...

2071
01:34:07,550 --> 01:34:08,830
It's not... It's harder.

2072
01:34:09,670 --> 01:34:10,570
It's gonna...

2073
01:34:10,570 --> 01:34:12,750
It'll be so much harder.

2074
01:34:13,570 --> 01:34:14,570
To play video games.

2075
01:34:15,250 --> 01:34:17,470
I think I can live with no touch.

2076
01:34:18,890 --> 01:34:21,510
As a gamer, I need my eyes.

2077
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:24,770
Guys, think of it this way.

2078
01:34:24,870 --> 01:34:27,570
I'm already lost enough...

2079
01:34:28,190 --> 01:34:30,530
I'm already lost enough...

2080
01:34:30,530 --> 01:34:30,930
I'm already lost enough...

2081
01:34:30,930 --> 01:34:31,350
With eyes.

2082
01:34:31,890 --> 01:34:33,450
How the fuck am I...

2083
01:34:36,330 --> 01:34:37,650
Now think...

2084
01:34:37,650 --> 01:34:39,210
What's gonna happen...

2085
01:34:39,210 --> 01:34:40,270
With no eyes.

2086
01:34:40,270 --> 01:34:42,550
If even with eyes...

2087
01:34:42,870 --> 01:34:43,790
And a map...

2088
01:34:43,790 --> 01:34:45,630
I get... I'm like directionless.

2089
01:34:46,110 --> 01:34:46,750
True.

2090
01:34:46,870 --> 01:34:48,750
I feel like that's even worse.

2091
01:34:48,770 --> 01:34:49,470
I'm gonna say...

2092
01:34:49,470 --> 01:34:50,810
Lose my sense of touch.

2093
01:34:52,250 --> 01:34:52,890
Yeah.

2094
01:34:53,110 --> 01:34:54,450
Yeah, no one chose that.

2095
01:34:54,590 --> 01:34:55,190
Thank God.

2096
01:34:55,290 --> 01:34:57,650
People who debated for like lose...

2097
01:34:58,430 --> 01:34:59,070
Okay.

2098
01:35:00,070 --> 01:35:00,390
Fast.

2099
01:35:01,230 --> 01:35:02,830
Why the f... Why?

2100
01:35:03,230 --> 01:35:05,950
Why would anyone pick this?

2101
01:35:06,270 --> 01:35:06,970
We're skipping.

2102
01:35:06,970 --> 01:35:09,210
Bro, who is the 15%?

2103
01:35:10,070 --> 01:35:11,490
What the fuck is wrong?

2104
01:35:12,250 --> 01:35:12,690
Like...

2105
01:35:12,690 --> 01:35:14,290
What the fuck is the...

2106
01:35:14,290 --> 01:35:16,450
Ring, thank you for the Akasupa.

2107
01:35:16,610 --> 01:35:17,630
Thank you, thank you.

2108
01:35:17,670 --> 01:35:20,650
Who is the 50% that chose that?

2109
01:35:20,850 --> 01:35:22,810
Like what the... Are you okay?

2110
01:35:23,430 --> 01:35:24,530
That's all I can think.

2111
01:35:24,630 --> 01:35:25,810
Like are you okay?

2112
01:35:27,470 --> 01:35:27,990
Um...

2113
01:35:29,730 --> 01:35:30,890
Marry your crush...

2114
01:35:30,890 --> 01:35:32,330
But you will slowly become...

2115
01:35:32,330 --> 01:35:33,050
Oh my God.

2116
01:35:33,070 --> 01:35:33,770
Enemies to lovers.

2117
01:35:38,330 --> 01:35:40,230
The perfect trope.

2118
01:35:40,230 --> 01:35:42,570
The perfect trope.

2119
01:35:43,210 --> 01:35:44,330
Because like...

2120
01:35:44,330 --> 01:35:45,870
That's worse, you know?

2121
01:35:46,050 --> 01:35:47,970
Things you like... Like a person...

2122
01:35:47,970 --> 01:35:50,630
And then you slowly hate them more and more and more.

2123
01:35:50,830 --> 01:35:50,870
And then you slowly hate them more and more and more.

2124
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:51,770
That's terrible.

2125
01:35:52,050 --> 01:35:52,810
I feel like...

2126
01:35:52,810 --> 01:35:54,390
Enemies to lovers.

2127
01:35:54,570 --> 01:35:55,050
Real!

2128
01:35:57,110 --> 01:35:59,410
But how slow is slowly?

2129
01:35:59,950 --> 01:36:00,710
How slow?

2130
01:36:00,750 --> 01:36:01,990
Like 90 years though?

2131
01:36:02,070 --> 01:36:03,750
Like on the diet... Like on the diet...

2132
01:36:03,770 --> 01:36:04,930
And you're like...

2133
01:36:05,770 --> 01:36:06,490
Bro...

2134
01:36:06,490 --> 01:36:09,870
I know we got married...

2135
01:36:09,870 --> 01:36:10,590
For like...

2136
01:36:10,590 --> 01:36:13,430
The green card... But bro...

2137
01:36:13,430 --> 01:36:14,430
I think...

2138
01:36:14,430 --> 01:36:16,710
I love you bro...

2139
01:36:20,490 --> 01:36:22,750
I think that's romantic.

2140
01:36:25,510 --> 01:36:28,090
It was just normal marriage.

2141
01:36:28,730 --> 01:36:29,770
Bro...

2142
01:36:29,770 --> 01:36:31,430
Bro...

2143
01:36:31,430 --> 01:36:32,130
Bro...

2144
01:36:35,120 --> 01:36:35,450
Okay.

2145
01:36:35,770 --> 01:36:36,690
We're gonna...

2146
01:36:36,690 --> 01:36:39,390
We're gonna go with this...

2147
01:36:39,390 --> 01:36:39,750
No poll.

2148
01:36:39,890 --> 01:36:41,070
This is too...

2149
01:36:41,070 --> 01:36:43,050
There's no way... Like yeah, why?

2150
01:36:43,450 --> 01:36:45,610
Like you're gonna eventually fall in love.

2151
01:36:45,950 --> 01:36:47,370
Be stuck outside...

2152
01:36:47,370 --> 01:36:49,650
All your... Be stuck... Okay that's just a pandemic...

2153
01:36:53,100 --> 01:36:55,240
That's just a pandemic.

2154
01:36:55,280 --> 01:36:57,020
We're already inside.

2155
01:36:57,360 --> 01:36:58,440
No poll for this.

2156
01:36:58,600 --> 01:37:00,000
No debate... Why?

2157
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:00,600
Why?

2158
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:02,900
Why would you want to be with nature?

2159
01:37:03,380 --> 01:37:05,840
How is... I don't understand.

2160
01:37:06,240 --> 01:37:12,180
The reason why we went outside is the reason why the pandemic lasted that long.

2161
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:13,340
Like...

2162
01:37:17,120 --> 01:37:19,220
Like, what the fuck?

2163
01:37:20,380 --> 01:37:21,200
Alright.

2164
01:37:22,420 --> 01:37:22,940
Alright.

2165
01:37:24,980 --> 01:37:26,020
Living forever...

2166
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:28,320
versus...

2167
01:37:29,120 --> 01:37:29,640
versus...

2168
01:37:30,160 --> 01:37:31,460
10 more years.

2169
01:37:31,980 --> 01:37:32,500
Alright.

2170
01:37:34,060 --> 01:37:35,100
Forever... 10.

2171
01:37:35,620 --> 01:37:38,160
Oh, this is like such a... what's it called?

2172
01:37:39,180 --> 01:37:40,380
It's such a...

2173
01:37:40,380 --> 01:37:43,920
I guess like a philosophical-esque question.

2174
01:37:44,020 --> 01:37:45,180
Like there's no right or wrong for this.

2175
01:37:45,340 --> 01:37:45,580
Okay.

2176
01:37:45,940 --> 01:37:47,580
Honestly, I choose forever.

2177
01:37:47,820 --> 01:37:48,600
Okay, no, no.

2178
01:37:48,640 --> 01:37:48,820
Okay.

2179
01:37:48,940 --> 01:37:49,560
Okay, it depends.

2180
01:37:49,940 --> 01:37:50,820
It really depends.

2181
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:53,600
Because like, I think like forever...

2182
01:37:54,940 --> 01:37:57,260
I feel like forever...

2183
01:37:57,260 --> 01:37:59,220
more so than 10 more years.

2184
01:37:59,420 --> 01:38:02,240
But forever is like pretty fucking rough.

2185
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:04,920
I need... Okay, actually, no.

2186
01:38:05,060 --> 01:38:07,560
It depends on how this is gonna be.

2187
01:38:07,820 --> 01:38:10,580
Will I age along with forever?

2188
01:38:11,120 --> 01:38:12,800
Can I say young?

2189
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:17,300
Because like...

2190
01:38:17,300 --> 01:38:21,180
What if like, you know, I'm like 350 years old?

2191
01:38:21,180 --> 01:38:22,920
And I am...

2192
01:38:22,920 --> 01:38:28,900
You look at me and you're like, yeah, she's 350 years old.

2193
01:38:31,960 --> 01:38:33,980
Like, I'm just thinking.

2194
01:38:34,300 --> 01:38:39,340
I won't be able to walk clearly at 350 years old.

2195
01:38:39,560 --> 01:38:42,580
I won't be able to eat for myself or use the...

2196
01:38:42,580 --> 01:38:47,720
I have to wear like fucking the elderly diapers and stuff like that.

2197
01:38:47,860 --> 01:38:50,120
Because you gotta admit when you're that old.

2198
01:38:50,120 --> 01:38:53,200
I don't think you can control much about your body.

2199
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:55,260
So I'm just thinking.

2200
01:38:57,140 --> 01:38:58,360
I'm just thinking.

2201
01:38:58,520 --> 01:39:00,280
I don't want to be like...

2202
01:39:00,280 --> 01:39:02,700
I don't want to look like I'm 350.

2203
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:04,860
I don't want...

2204
01:39:07,540 --> 01:39:08,220
So...

2205
01:39:08,220 --> 01:39:09,940
Also like...

2206
01:39:09,940 --> 01:39:13,220
I'm scared about like what the world's gonna be...

2207
01:39:13,220 --> 01:39:16,280
after 350 years later.

2208
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:18,020
I'm a little scared.

2209
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:19,400
So...

2210
01:39:19,400 --> 01:39:22,660
So I just think maybe 10 more years is better.

2211
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:27,760
Because I'm worried about what are the conditions of forever.

2212
01:39:31,400 --> 01:39:32,000
Because like...

2213
01:39:36,100 --> 01:39:38,320
What happens when the sun explodes?

2214
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:39,920
I don't know if you guys know this.

2215
01:39:40,280 --> 01:39:41,360
But like...

2216
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:43,680
The sun is alive, technically.

2217
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:45,700
Well, not really alive.

2218
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:46,940
But like it will...

2219
01:39:46,940 --> 01:39:48,560
The sun will eventually die.

2220
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:50,620
Because it's a giant ass star.

2221
01:39:50,860 --> 01:39:52,940
And like stars eventually die.

2222
01:39:53,480 --> 01:39:54,040
So...

2223
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:55,560
Like...

2224
01:39:55,560 --> 01:39:56,840
When the sun explodes...

2225
01:39:56,840 --> 01:39:58,280
What's gonna happen to me?

2226
01:39:58,520 --> 01:40:00,040
How am I surviving that?

2227
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:01,760
I can't breathe in...

2228
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:04,160
I can't breathe in space.

2229
01:40:06,420 --> 01:40:09,240
Yes, eventually the sun will die.

2230
01:40:09,660 --> 01:40:12,720
And like what the fuck am I gonna do when the sun dies?

2231
01:40:12,900 --> 01:40:15,920
Like I'm just gonna float in space until I land on another planet?

2232
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:18,480
Because I live forever.

2233
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:21,800
Move elsewhere?

2234
01:40:22,420 --> 01:40:29,100
I guess like by the time the sun explodes we would have the technology to like move to another planet.

2235
01:40:29,240 --> 01:40:29,920
You live...

2236
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:31,120
Hopefully no dimension.

2237
01:40:31,380 --> 01:40:32,540
That too, Jonathan.

2238
01:40:32,840 --> 01:40:33,700
Thank you for the super chat.

2239
01:40:33,780 --> 01:40:34,080
Thank you.

2240
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:35,920
So I'm gonna choose 10 more...

2241
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:37,900
There's too many variables I can't control.

2242
01:40:38,180 --> 01:40:38,980
But forever.

2243
01:40:39,380 --> 01:40:42,060
I don't know if I'm gonna be young forever.

2244
01:40:42,900 --> 01:40:45,900
I don't know if I'm gonna be young forever or I'm gonna be like...

2245
01:40:45,900 --> 01:40:48,260
The age of which I am forever of.

2246
01:40:48,660 --> 01:40:49,180
So...

2247
01:40:50,680 --> 01:40:51,960
So 10 more years.

2248
01:40:52,460 --> 01:40:53,920
I'm gonna pick 10 more years.

2249
01:40:54,380 --> 01:40:55,500
I feel like yeah.

2250
01:40:56,140 --> 01:40:57,580
I'm in the majority there.

2251
01:40:58,480 --> 01:40:58,980
Okay.

2252
01:40:59,160 --> 01:41:00,900
Have to walk on all fours.

2253
01:41:00,900 --> 01:41:02,440
Have to hop on one foot.

2254
01:41:02,580 --> 01:41:03,920
What if you just don't go anywhere?

2255
01:41:06,660 --> 01:41:09,340
I feel like you trip more with this though.

2256
01:41:09,580 --> 01:41:10,800
I feel like...

2257
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:12,540
I don't wanna make a poll for this.

2258
01:41:12,820 --> 01:41:13,940
I feel like...

2259
01:41:13,940 --> 01:41:14,460
You...

2260
01:41:14,460 --> 01:41:16,500
There's more chances to trip more.

2261
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:18,560
But then you look so...

2262
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:18,840
Okay.

2263
01:41:18,980 --> 01:41:19,260
You...

2264
01:41:19,260 --> 01:41:21,980
Both of these options you look so fucking stupid.

2265
01:41:25,160 --> 01:41:25,840
Like...

2266
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:27,020
No matter what.

2267
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:30,760
Both of these options you look so fucking stupid.

2268
01:41:34,120 --> 01:41:34,800
Yes.

2269
01:41:34,920 --> 01:41:36,960
But then your hands gonna touch like...

2270
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:38,440
Unless you wear hand shoes.

2271
01:41:38,680 --> 01:41:39,520
I guess like...

2272
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:40,380
By then...

2273
01:41:40,380 --> 01:41:42,940
I'll invest in hand shoes though.

2274
01:41:43,080 --> 01:41:43,880
So like...

2275
01:41:44,460 --> 01:41:45,720
My hands won't be like...

2276
01:41:45,720 --> 01:41:46,540
Touching like...

2277
01:41:46,540 --> 01:41:47,300
The gross stuff.

2278
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:48,300
But...

2279
01:41:48,300 --> 01:41:49,440
Oh my god.

2280
01:41:51,880 --> 01:41:52,600
Well...

2281
01:41:52,600 --> 01:41:53,200
You walking.

2282
01:41:53,480 --> 01:41:54,160
What if you drive?

2283
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:54,800
Good...

2284
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:55,780
Good question.

2285
01:41:56,040 --> 01:41:57,020
This says walk.

2286
01:41:57,580 --> 01:41:59,460
It doesn't say gloves.

2287
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:00,340
Oh sorry.

2288
01:42:00,600 --> 01:42:01,260
Gloves.

2289
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:03,580
My hand shoes.

2290
01:42:04,120 --> 01:42:04,840
Sorry.

2291
01:42:05,120 --> 01:42:06,840
In other words...

2292
01:42:06,840 --> 01:42:07,600
Gloves.

2293
01:42:07,640 --> 01:42:09,000
That's what I meant.

2294
01:42:09,160 --> 01:42:09,860
Gloves.

2295
01:42:17,260 --> 01:42:19,060
I can just wear gloves.

2296
01:42:19,200 --> 01:42:20,600
So I won't have to like...

2297
01:42:20,600 --> 01:42:21,140
Oh my gosh.

2298
01:42:21,160 --> 01:42:21,800
This is difficult.

2299
01:42:22,300 --> 01:42:23,560
But if I never...

2300
01:42:23,560 --> 01:42:24,820
That's so difficult.

2301
01:42:25,040 --> 01:42:26,660
Because it's like...

2302
01:42:26,660 --> 01:42:27,920
What if like...

2303
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:28,220
Okay.

2304
01:42:28,460 --> 01:42:28,820
Like...

2305
01:42:28,820 --> 01:42:29,120
Okay.

2306
01:42:29,160 --> 01:42:30,080
Here's what I'm thinking.

2307
01:42:30,240 --> 01:42:31,500
What if I like go to a buffet?

2308
01:42:32,280 --> 01:42:34,160
I have to walk to a thing.

2309
01:42:34,300 --> 01:42:34,700
Where do...

2310
01:42:34,700 --> 01:42:36,880
And then we have to walk back to the buffet area.

2311
01:42:37,240 --> 01:42:37,680
Like...

2312
01:42:37,680 --> 01:42:39,020
It doesn't work for me.

2313
01:42:39,100 --> 01:42:41,480
I guess I'll have someone else to hold my tray.

2314
01:42:42,160 --> 01:42:42,840
Because like...

2315
01:42:42,840 --> 01:42:44,100
How the fuck am I gonna...

2316
01:42:44,100 --> 01:42:44,960
Like...

2317
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:47,880
How am I going to fucking...

2318
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:50,620
I'll just never be able to go to buffets anymore.

2319
01:42:51,860 --> 01:42:53,960
Hold the plate in your mouth.

2320
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,840
I'll never be able to do buffets anymore.

2321
01:43:00,160 --> 01:43:01,320
I don't...

2322
01:43:01,320 --> 01:43:02,220
Just don't go...

2323
01:43:02,220 --> 01:43:02,820
Doki.

2324
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:05,000
There's a very simple answer to this.

2325
01:43:05,220 --> 01:43:07,140
Just don't go to the buffet.

2326
01:43:12,420 --> 01:43:14,080
But what if I want to go to the buffet?

2327
01:43:14,100 --> 01:43:14,680
I don't want to.

2328
01:43:14,820 --> 01:43:20,800
I'd like to have the choice of being able to go to the buffet.

2329
01:43:21,400 --> 01:43:22,800
I want to have...

2330
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:23,540
It's like...

2331
01:43:23,540 --> 01:43:23,960
Okay.

2332
01:43:24,060 --> 01:43:24,580
It's like...

2333
01:43:24,580 --> 01:43:24,920
You know...

2334
01:43:24,920 --> 01:43:26,020
Like I would never do this.

2335
01:43:26,140 --> 01:43:28,920
But I'd like to have the choice to do it.

2336
01:43:29,020 --> 01:43:29,580
Like...

2337
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:32,900
Like...

2338
01:43:32,900 --> 01:43:34,960
I would not want to commit murder.

2339
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:36,340
But I would...

2340
01:43:36,340 --> 01:43:38,060
If the choice comes...

2341
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:41,640
You know...

2342
01:43:41,640 --> 01:43:42,740
It's sort of relatable.

2343
01:43:42,740 --> 01:43:44,900
It's sort of something you can compare.

2344
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:47,020
Anyway.

2345
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:49,880
I think I'd choose...

2346
01:43:49,880 --> 01:43:51,480
I feel like...

2347
01:43:52,450 --> 01:43:56,660
I feel like hopping on one foot causes more accidents.

2348
01:43:58,560 --> 01:43:59,940
Over like...

2349
01:43:59,940 --> 01:44:02,300
Walking all fours wherever you go.

2350
01:44:02,500 --> 01:44:03,300
So I'm gonna...

2351
01:44:03,300 --> 01:44:05,000
I'm gonna go with all fours.

2352
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:05,460
Anyway.

2353
01:44:05,460 --> 01:44:07,680
I'm gonna go with all fours, guys.

2354
01:44:08,840 --> 01:44:09,540
Alright.

2355
01:44:09,660 --> 01:44:11,660
There's more people with hopping on...

2356
01:44:11,660 --> 01:44:12,040
Why?

2357
01:44:12,740 --> 01:44:13,080
Guys.

2358
01:44:13,180 --> 01:44:15,000
Who wants to hop on one foot?

2359
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:17,180
Give me your why.

2360
01:44:17,420 --> 01:44:19,100
I need you guys to explain your reasons.

2361
01:44:19,340 --> 01:44:20,480
Who is like the normies?

2362
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:21,580
Who are the normies here?

2363
01:44:22,040 --> 01:44:23,020
Who's the normies?

2364
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:25,060
Why would you want to hop on one foot?

2365
01:44:25,220 --> 01:44:26,180
Over like...

2366
01:44:26,720 --> 01:44:26,960
On...

2367
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:28,220
Using all fours.

2368
01:44:29,100 --> 01:44:31,500
All fours is the furry answer.

2369
01:44:33,560 --> 01:44:35,560
I hate no furry.

2370
01:44:40,020 --> 01:44:40,500
Okay.

2371
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:46,700
I need you guys to explain your reasons for not hopping on one foot.

2372
01:44:47,480 --> 01:44:50,220
Win the lottery but lose all your friends.

2373
01:44:50,360 --> 01:44:52,280
I mean that's basically what actually happens.

2374
01:44:52,540 --> 01:44:54,740
Remain broke but keep your friends.

2375
01:44:55,300 --> 01:44:55,900
Okay.

2376
01:44:57,240 --> 01:44:58,220
Just don't...

2377
01:44:58,220 --> 01:44:58,700
Okay.

2378
01:44:58,780 --> 01:44:59,800
But like...

2379
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:02,540
People on the Internet won't know that...

2380
01:45:02,540 --> 01:45:04,640
You can't make Internet friends as well.

2381
01:45:04,900 --> 01:45:05,240
Like...

2382
01:45:05,240 --> 01:45:05,820
Where does this go?

2383
01:45:06,340 --> 01:45:07,900
So two and...

2384
01:45:07,900 --> 01:45:08,900
No.

2385
01:45:08,940 --> 01:45:09,880
Where is my phone?

2386
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:12,120
Okay.

2387
01:45:12,220 --> 01:45:12,500
Okay.

2388
01:45:12,500 --> 01:45:16,040
No friends, but money vs.

2389
01:45:16,620 --> 01:45:18,780
no money friends.

2390
01:45:19,160 --> 01:45:19,800
Okay.

2391
01:45:22,200 --> 01:45:22,840
Money.

2392
01:45:22,980 --> 01:45:24,580
No friends.

2393
01:45:25,500 --> 01:45:26,140
Friends.

2394
01:45:28,540 --> 01:45:30,740
Yeah, like, can I just make new friends?

2395
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:33,400
Yeah, I'll just make new friends.

2396
01:45:35,300 --> 01:45:37,380
I'm just saying, like...

2397
01:45:38,420 --> 01:45:45,240
I mean, winning the... also, I like how dated this is because winning the lottery doesn't even mean you...

2398
01:45:45,240 --> 01:45:48,500
like, a golden ticket anymore because of taxes.

2399
01:45:49,020 --> 01:45:55,300
Apparently, a lot of, like, lottery winners don't know, especially, like, if they're, like, they come from, like, not a lot of money.

2400
01:45:55,480 --> 01:46:00,640
They think winning the lottery immediately, automatically means you have money forever.

2401
01:46:01,240 --> 01:46:07,020
And a lot of lottery winners do not know that when you win the lottery, a lot of that money...

2402
01:46:07,020 --> 01:46:07,360
Like, it was like...

2403
01:46:07,380 --> 01:46:08,700
This is like a 1 million jackpot.

2404
01:46:08,920 --> 01:46:11,900
A lot of that money is just gonna be gone from taxes.

2405
01:46:12,300 --> 01:46:17,140
So, mostly, you... yeah, taxes take, like, 60% of the million.

2406
01:46:17,560 --> 01:46:21,100
And then you're left with, I don't know, like, 60% of that.

2407
01:46:21,340 --> 01:46:24,420
And then after... but then they'll be like, oh, I'm gonna quit my job.

2408
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:29,060
And, like, my entire family is gonna sustain with, uh...

2409
01:46:29,060 --> 01:46:29,960
I'm...

2410
01:46:29,960 --> 01:46:33,360
Our entire lottery is gonna sustain with just the winnings.

2411
01:46:33,380 --> 01:46:37,360
And then they end up using all their money after, like, five years.

2412
01:46:41,140 --> 01:46:43,200
And then... and then they're broke again.

2413
01:46:43,400 --> 01:46:44,220
And then they're broke.

2414
01:46:44,700 --> 01:46:47,160
And... and then they go back.

2415
01:46:47,260 --> 01:46:48,960
They have to fucking get a job again.

2416
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:56,940
Or... or another thing that happens is that a lot of people don't want their names...

2417
01:46:57,740 --> 01:47:00,260
Don't want their names to be public.

2418
01:47:01,360 --> 01:47:03,360
To be public in winning the lottery.

2419
01:47:03,620 --> 01:47:06,700
Because after winning the lottery, you have to...

2420
01:47:07,240 --> 01:47:12,660
A lot of your family and friends and relatives will try to contact you to be like, Oh my god, congratulations!

2421
01:47:13,460 --> 01:47:15,220
Can I borrow some of that money?

2422
01:47:15,640 --> 01:47:19,260
And then apparently... apparently a lot of them try to stay anonymous and stuff.

2423
01:47:19,340 --> 01:47:22,200
Because they don't want, like... they don't want that to happen to them.

2424
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:24,180
And at one point, like, I don't know...

2425
01:47:24,640 --> 01:47:25,740
I read, like...

2426
01:47:26,900 --> 01:47:31,700
An article that one family, like, the parents got divorced and stuff.

2427
01:47:31,740 --> 01:47:34,380
And they're like, the lottery ruined our lives!

2428
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:38,940
It ruined our lives!

2429
01:47:39,160 --> 01:47:41,020
I wish I would never won the lottery!

2430
01:47:41,460 --> 01:47:44,200
I read there was, like, one guy that won the lottery.

2431
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:47,640
And he came over to pick it up with, like, with a mask on.

2432
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:50,380
And he never told his family that he won.

2433
01:47:50,620 --> 01:47:53,260
He just, like, kept it in, like, some trust or something.

2434
01:47:53,540 --> 01:47:55,300
He was like, yeah, I'm not telling anybody.

2435
01:47:56,520 --> 01:47:57,600
That's so smart!

2436
01:47:57,960 --> 01:47:58,720
That's so smart!

2437
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:00,900
So, like, it's like an emergency fund.

2438
01:48:01,060 --> 01:48:02,600
Like, he just kept doing his job.

2439
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:05,800
He just, like, kept working the same job.

2440
01:48:06,280 --> 01:48:08,180
Pretending that he never won the lottery.

2441
01:48:11,240 --> 01:48:14,020
I think he, like, wore a gorilla mask or some shit.

2442
01:48:14,480 --> 01:48:17,200
Yeah, a lot of divorces happen and stuff, too.

2443
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:18,160
Because of the lottery.

2444
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:19,960
D-Dragon, thank you for the super chat!

2445
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:20,840
Thank you, thank you!

2446
01:48:21,360 --> 01:48:25,660
Apparently, winning the lottery in Canada needs you to do a math problem to receive the money.

2447
01:48:25,680 --> 01:48:29,120
So, option one is not viable for Doki.

2448
01:48:29,720 --> 01:48:31,060
Thank you for the super chat!

2449
01:48:31,120 --> 01:48:31,980
Thank you, thank you!

2450
01:48:32,920 --> 01:48:34,220
Good, thank you for the super chat!

2451
01:48:34,300 --> 01:48:35,120
Thank you, thank you!

2452
01:48:35,120 --> 01:48:38,220
Canadian lottery winnings aren't ta- Oh my god, that's so nice.

2453
01:48:38,620 --> 01:48:39,880
That's so fucking nice.

2454
01:48:39,980 --> 01:48:40,720
Thank you for the super chat.

2455
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:41,500
Thank you, thank you!

2456
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:43,740
I feel like people don't talk about the lottery anymore.

2457
01:48:43,960 --> 01:48:46,560
A lot of things, people don't talk a lot anymore.

2458
01:48:47,060 --> 01:48:48,920
I'm surprised people still watch TV.

2459
01:48:50,260 --> 01:48:52,520
That people still have, like, cable packages.

2460
01:48:52,940 --> 01:48:57,740
I'm pretty sure, like, the people who still watch TV, or, like...

2461
01:48:57,740 --> 01:49:03,320
I'm sorry, any dragoons that are still watching TV, I am so sorry.

2462
01:49:06,660 --> 01:49:09,060
I don't mean you guys, of course.

2463
01:49:09,160 --> 01:49:15,920
If you're a dragoon that still watches TV and, like, television, I don't mean you guys.

2464
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:17,300
I meant the other people.

2465
01:49:22,080 --> 01:49:24,040
I... no, no, no, don't feel attacked.

2466
01:49:24,200 --> 01:49:25,300
I don't mean you guys.

2467
01:49:25,520 --> 01:49:27,280
I mean the other people.

2468
01:49:27,380 --> 01:49:28,120
That's not you.

2469
01:49:32,040 --> 01:49:34,540
Anyway, as I was...

2470
01:49:35,120 --> 01:49:39,080
As I was saying, I... I'm surprised, like...

2471
01:49:39,080 --> 01:49:43,280
Like, television networks are still making money off of, like, cable packages.

2472
01:49:43,480 --> 01:49:44,780
Off of cable in general.

2473
01:49:45,460 --> 01:49:46,060
And...

2474
01:49:46,940 --> 01:49:51,580
I don't... I never... I haven't had... I haven't watched TV in so fucking long.

2475
01:49:51,820 --> 01:49:54,260
Honestly, ever since, like, the piece... like...

2476
01:49:54,260 --> 01:49:59,780
Ever since streaming services was invented, I've just never watched TV again.

2477
01:50:00,760 --> 01:50:01,360
Uh...

2478
01:50:01,360 --> 01:50:03,580
Affiliate, I think about 10 gift-a-ships.

2479
01:50:03,580 --> 01:50:04,520
Thank you, thank you!

2480
01:50:04,520 --> 01:50:05,800
I really do appreciate it.

2481
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:06,520
Thank you so much!

2482
01:50:06,820 --> 01:50:07,340
Breezy!

2483
01:50:07,540 --> 01:50:09,460
But if I win, I can give more money to...

2484
01:50:09,460 --> 01:50:11,240
Exactly, Breezy!

2485
01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:13,040
I'm your trust system.

2486
01:50:13,360 --> 01:50:14,360
I'm your bank.

2487
01:50:16,580 --> 01:50:17,720
We were branded.

2488
01:50:18,060 --> 01:50:21,260
Um, if you were part of the old bank, do not worry.

2489
01:50:21,460 --> 01:50:23,840
We've just reba... re... rebranded.

2490
01:50:23,840 --> 01:50:25,000
It's the Doki Bank now.

2491
01:50:25,260 --> 01:50:27,380
Um, same... same interest rates.

2492
01:50:27,480 --> 01:50:29,200
Your accounts are still here, by the way.

2493
01:50:29,280 --> 01:50:31,420
The Doki Bank account is still here.

2494
01:50:31,700 --> 01:50:32,180
Uh...

2495
01:50:32,180 --> 01:50:34,420
Your bank accounts are still safe.

2496
01:50:34,420 --> 01:50:37,160
The bank of Doki is still very safe.

2497
01:50:37,320 --> 01:50:38,400
Very good loans.

2498
01:50:38,620 --> 01:50:40,000
Very good interest rates.

2499
01:50:40,420 --> 01:50:45,220
So, just... if you ever win the lottery, just open an account in the bank of Doki.

2500
01:50:45,560 --> 01:50:46,520
Um, anyway...

2501
01:50:46,520 --> 01:50:48,880
I'd rather win the lottery, but lose all my friends.

2502
01:50:49,020 --> 01:50:49,240
What?

2503
01:50:49,400 --> 01:50:49,780
Really?

2504
01:50:50,240 --> 01:50:51,800
Why would you want to be broke?

2505
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:53,120
It's not fun!

2506
01:50:53,760 --> 01:50:57,020
It's like... people say remain broke, but keep all my friends.

2507
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:58,900
They've never been poor before.

2508
01:51:00,300 --> 01:51:00,820
Like...

2509
01:51:00,820 --> 01:51:01,580
What the...

2510
01:51:01,580 --> 01:51:03,620
Thank you, thank you for the super chat.

2511
01:51:03,700 --> 01:51:04,400
Thank you, thank you!

2512
01:51:04,420 --> 01:51:06,500
Here's my deposit!

2513
01:51:07,600 --> 01:51:09,000
Thank you for the super chat.

2514
01:51:09,160 --> 01:51:10,020
Thank you, thank you!

2515
01:51:10,380 --> 01:51:10,860
Like...

2516
01:51:11,320 --> 01:51:12,220
Like, I'm just saying...

2517
01:51:12,220 --> 01:51:16,060
I don't think they understand what the concept of being broke is.

2518
01:51:16,300 --> 01:51:16,760
Yeah...

2519
01:51:21,890 --> 01:51:22,370
I...

2520
01:51:23,210 --> 01:51:23,690
Like...

2521
01:51:23,690 --> 01:51:24,890
I'm just thinking...

2522
01:51:24,890 --> 01:51:25,330
Like...

2523
01:51:25,330 --> 01:51:28,030
I don't think they understand, like...

2524
01:51:28,030 --> 01:51:29,830
Like, what broke really is.

2525
01:51:29,890 --> 01:51:31,330
I think they're just like, oh, that's just me.

2526
01:51:31,510 --> 01:51:31,950
Yeah...

2527
01:51:36,270 --> 01:51:36,830
Um...

2528
01:51:37,570 --> 01:51:38,130
Alright.

2529
01:51:38,570 --> 01:51:40,930
Get piercings everywhere possible.

2530
01:51:41,450 --> 01:51:42,570
Tongue... I...

2531
01:51:42,570 --> 01:51:45,010
Well, I can like, remove the piercings, right?

2532
01:51:46,190 --> 01:51:46,750
Alright.

2533
01:51:47,370 --> 01:51:48,490
Let's see...

2534
01:51:48,490 --> 01:51:51,270
They say broke while still eating food.

2535
01:51:51,390 --> 01:51:55,150
Like, I'm just saying, like, when you're broke, you can't afford, like...

2536
01:51:55,150 --> 01:51:56,030
Like, you can't...

2537
01:51:56,030 --> 01:51:59,030
You have to like, be really strategic on how the fuck...

2538
01:51:59,030 --> 01:51:59,750
Like...

2539
01:51:59,750 --> 01:52:02,250
On how to survive day to day.

2540
01:52:02,790 --> 01:52:03,350
Like...

2541
01:52:03,990 --> 01:52:04,550
Um...

2542
01:52:05,950 --> 01:52:06,430
Okay.

2543
01:52:06,950 --> 01:52:07,610
Let's see.

2544
01:52:08,290 --> 01:52:08,770
Piercings...

2545
01:52:10,490 --> 01:52:11,450
Versus tattoos.

2546
01:52:13,370 --> 01:52:13,850
Piercings...

2547
01:52:15,130 --> 01:52:15,610
Tattoos...

2548
01:52:16,710 --> 01:52:18,870
But if your friend is a million...

2549
01:52:18,870 --> 01:52:20,170
Thank you for the super chat, JP.

2550
01:52:20,350 --> 01:52:20,790
Thank you.

2551
01:52:20,810 --> 01:52:21,450
Thank you.

2552
01:52:21,790 --> 01:52:23,610
I mean, if you're already broke...

2553
01:52:23,610 --> 01:52:26,750
And you're saying your friends are really a millionaire...

2554
01:52:26,750 --> 01:52:27,870
But you're still broke...

2555
01:52:27,870 --> 01:52:28,890
Like, it's the same problem.

2556
01:52:29,130 --> 01:52:29,490
Like...

2557
01:52:29,490 --> 01:52:30,290
Like...

2558
01:52:30,290 --> 01:52:31,490
Your friend...

2559
01:52:31,490 --> 01:52:32,550
Like, I'm just saying...

2560
01:52:32,550 --> 01:52:33,190
Like...

2561
01:52:33,190 --> 01:52:33,570
It's...

2562
01:52:34,870 --> 01:52:36,530
Then you wouldn't be broke.

2563
01:52:37,230 --> 01:52:41,630
You're like, my friend's a millionaire, but you still have the same problem about being broke.

2564
01:52:41,930 --> 01:52:42,570
You're still...

2565
01:52:42,570 --> 01:52:44,190
Then you still have that problem.

2566
01:52:48,370 --> 01:52:48,930
Um...

2567
01:52:52,770 --> 01:52:53,330
Anyway...

2568
01:52:54,010 --> 01:52:55,470
I would say...

2569
01:52:55,470 --> 01:52:55,950
Okay.

2570
01:52:56,130 --> 01:52:57,050
I don't know...

2571
01:52:57,050 --> 01:52:57,210
Okay.

2572
01:52:57,290 --> 01:52:57,550
Okay.

2573
01:52:57,570 --> 01:52:58,470
The thing is...

2574
01:52:59,070 --> 01:53:00,130
But like...

2575
01:53:00,130 --> 01:53:02,630
Does the head count as the tattoos?

2576
01:53:02,990 --> 01:53:03,550
I don't know.

2577
01:53:03,550 --> 01:53:07,850
Cause if it's just like the rest of my body, but not the head...

2578
01:53:07,850 --> 01:53:10,050
So then I could just cover it up for...

2579
01:53:10,050 --> 01:53:12,870
Like, if I have a real job that's not streaming...

2580
01:53:12,870 --> 01:53:16,990
And like, I have to go to the office and I have to cover everything up...

2581
01:53:16,990 --> 01:53:17,930
I guess like...

2582
01:53:17,930 --> 01:53:18,730
Is the head...

2583
01:53:18,730 --> 01:53:18,970
Okay.

2584
01:53:19,070 --> 01:53:20,390
But tattoos on the head?

2585
01:53:20,650 --> 01:53:21,610
On the face?

2586
01:53:21,950 --> 01:53:22,950
I don't know.

2587
01:53:23,310 --> 01:53:24,290
Face tattoos?

2588
01:53:24,970 --> 01:53:25,370
From...

2589
01:53:25,370 --> 01:53:25,550
I...

2590
01:53:25,550 --> 01:53:26,250
In my...

2591
01:53:26,250 --> 01:53:27,710
This is my personal opinion.

2592
01:53:28,270 --> 01:53:29,270
Face tattoos?

2593
01:53:29,770 --> 01:53:30,790
Just not it.

2594
01:53:31,190 --> 01:53:31,730
Like...

2595
01:53:31,730 --> 01:53:33,050
I just...

2596
01:53:36,110 --> 01:53:37,510
Just not it.

2597
01:53:37,590 --> 01:53:38,430
Face tattoos.

2598
01:53:38,750 --> 01:53:39,070
Just...

2599
01:53:39,070 --> 01:53:40,770
This is my own opinion.

2600
01:53:40,990 --> 01:53:41,630
But yeah.

2601
01:53:41,750 --> 01:53:42,750
Face tattoos?

2602
01:53:42,770 --> 01:53:44,990
Just not hitting it for me.

2603
01:53:48,810 --> 01:53:50,030
I feel like...

2604
01:53:50,030 --> 01:53:51,090
I don't know.

2605
01:53:51,250 --> 01:53:53,530
I just find face tattoos just...

2606
01:53:53,890 --> 01:53:54,210
Yeah.

2607
01:53:56,910 --> 01:53:58,470
Like, for piercings?

2608
01:53:58,710 --> 01:54:01,430
I can at least remove the piercings.

2609
01:54:01,510 --> 01:54:01,890
Right?

2610
01:54:03,050 --> 01:54:03,730
The piercings.

2611
01:54:03,890 --> 01:54:06,310
And then I can just remove it later.

2612
01:54:06,590 --> 01:54:07,390
So it's not...

2613
01:54:08,040 --> 01:54:08,310
Like...

2614
01:54:08,310 --> 01:54:10,170
It's just like places you can pierce.

2615
01:54:11,810 --> 01:54:13,590
This is all pretty bad.

2616
01:54:13,830 --> 01:54:16,130
I don't think I can get like a normal job.

2617
01:54:17,690 --> 01:54:18,230
Like...

2618
01:54:23,210 --> 01:54:28,450
Like, thinking about it, I'm just like, I can definitely not get a normal job.

2619
01:54:29,090 --> 01:54:31,010
In either of these scenarios.

2620
01:54:31,670 --> 01:54:32,210
Like...

2621
01:54:34,690 --> 01:54:35,130
Um...

2622
01:54:36,590 --> 01:54:37,030
Oh...

2623
01:54:37,030 --> 01:54:38,710
And like, my skin can heal.

2624
01:54:39,070 --> 01:54:39,510
Right?

2625
01:54:40,350 --> 01:54:42,730
Like, it doesn't mean I have to keep my piercings.

2626
01:54:42,810 --> 01:54:44,350
It's like when you get your ears pierced.

2627
01:54:44,430 --> 01:54:45,590
And then it heals.

2628
01:54:45,630 --> 01:54:46,430
In the end.

2629
01:54:46,650 --> 01:54:47,030
Right?

2630
01:54:47,430 --> 01:54:48,470
So like...

2631
01:54:48,470 --> 01:54:52,010
I feel like, you know, I could just get these piercings once.

2632
01:54:52,570 --> 01:54:55,410
And then the skin will just heal later on.

2633
01:54:55,470 --> 01:54:57,010
If I don't like keep it going.

2634
01:54:57,710 --> 01:54:58,590
That's just cheating.

2635
01:54:58,750 --> 01:54:59,430
It doesn't!

2636
01:54:59,430 --> 01:55:00,110
There was no...

2637
01:55:00,110 --> 01:55:00,730
What do you mean?

2638
01:55:00,870 --> 01:55:02,190
It's not cheating because it's not a problem.

2639
01:55:02,190 --> 01:55:04,130
It literally doesn't tell me the terms and conditions.

2640
01:55:04,510 --> 01:55:06,830
I make up the terms and conditions.

2641
01:55:07,170 --> 01:55:07,690
Here.

2642
01:55:08,270 --> 01:55:08,790
Um...

2643
01:55:08,790 --> 01:55:09,850
Does she know?

2644
01:55:10,030 --> 01:55:11,410
Wait, what do you mean if I know?

2645
01:55:12,450 --> 01:55:12,970
You...

2646
01:55:12,970 --> 01:55:13,730
You would...

2647
01:55:13,730 --> 01:55:15,090
What the fuck?

2648
01:55:19,030 --> 01:55:20,530
Tattoo isn't permanent?

2649
01:55:20,790 --> 01:55:21,430
Yes, they are!

2650
01:55:21,690 --> 01:55:22,610
What do you mean?

2651
01:55:23,250 --> 01:55:24,490
These are like...

2652
01:55:24,490 --> 01:55:27,070
Unless you're talking about like temporary tattoos.

2653
01:55:27,370 --> 01:55:28,090
Like the ones...

2654
01:55:28,090 --> 01:55:29,610
Do you know there's like a way you can like...

2655
01:55:29,610 --> 01:55:30,750
Okay, I've been...

2656
01:55:30,750 --> 01:55:30,990
Alright.

2657
01:55:31,250 --> 01:55:32,090
This is like...

2658
01:55:32,090 --> 01:55:32,170
You know what I mean?

2659
01:55:32,170 --> 01:55:34,610
There's like a guilty pleasure YouTube short channel that I've been watching.

2660
01:55:34,830 --> 01:55:35,450
But the...

2661
01:55:35,450 --> 01:55:35,850
The...

2662
01:55:36,490 --> 01:55:38,010
The Victor channel.

2663
01:55:38,170 --> 01:55:42,630
There's like a YouTube short channel where it is some guy cosplay...

2664
01:55:42,630 --> 01:55:45,270
Pretending as Victor from Despicable Me.

2665
01:55:45,450 --> 01:55:47,350
And he does these like internet...

2666
01:55:47,350 --> 01:55:50,130
Like proving internet videos if they're real or not.

2667
01:55:50,530 --> 01:55:50,910
And...

2668

2673
01:55:57,250 --> 01:55:58,390

Of like those like...

2676
01:56:01,890 --> 01:56:06,210
There's like a machine where you can print temporary tattoos on your body.

2677
01:56:07,110 --> 01:56:07,510
And...

2678
01:56:07,510 --> 01:56:08,290

2683
01:56:11,590 --> 01:56:13,210
You just put the data of what you want to print.

2684
01:56:13,490 --> 01:56:14,890
Yeah, it's a tattoo print.

2685
01:56:15,030 --> 01:56:15,510
That guy.

2686
01:56:15,830 --> 01:56:17,550

01:56:20,410 --> 01:56:21,890
Like temporary tattoos on your skin.

2689

You don't have to do that whole like wetting the paper...

01:56:25,250 --> 01:56:27,010

01:56:27,610 --> 01:56:28,210
Wetting it.

01:56:28,370 --> 01:56:29,970
And then put it on your skin.

2694
01:56:30,090 --> 01:56:30,770
And then like...

2695
01:56:30,770 --> 01:56:31,970
Like hold it on for a while.

2696
01:56:32,110 --> 01:56:36,570
There's literally a machine that can just print tattoos on your skin.

2697
01:56:36,730 --> 01:56:37,890
Print temporary tattoos.

2698
01:56:37,970 --> 01:56:40,010
Any temporary tattoo you want to.

2699
01:56:40,190 --> 01:56:41,890
I thought that was so fucking sick.

2700
01:56:42,590 --> 01:56:43,150
Um...

2701
01:56:45,590 --> 01:56:46,150
Anyway...

2702
01:56:46,150 --> 01:56:47,130
Uh...

2703
01:56:47,130 --> 01:56:47,870
Anyway...

2704
01:56:47,870 --> 01:56:48,390
I don't...

2705
01:56:48,390 --> 01:56:49,330
I don't know.

2706
01:56:49,390 --> 01:56:50,850
Does that include the eyes too?

2707
01:56:51,390 --> 01:56:53,930
You know like there's people that tattoo their eyes?

2708
01:56:54,250 --> 01:56:55,930
People are so fucking weird now.

2709
01:56:56,130 --> 01:56:56,550
Like...

2710
01:56:56,550 --> 01:56:59,530
You know like when technology advances more and more.

2711
01:56:59,650 --> 01:57:00,510
People are like...

2712
01:57:00,770 --> 01:57:01,070
Oh my god.

2713
01:57:01,110 --> 01:57:02,570
But what if I do this now?

2714
01:57:02,890 --> 01:57:03,350
Like...

2715
01:57:03,350 --> 01:57:04,510
Like...

2716
01:57:04,510 --> 01:57:06,070
Oh my god.

2717
01:57:06,450 --> 01:57:07,090
Technology.

2718
01:57:07,090 --> 01:57:08,270
It is advancing.

2719
01:57:08,610 --> 01:57:10,570
What if I tattoo my eye?

2720
01:57:10,850 --> 01:57:16,170
Anyway there was an article where some lady tattooed her eye and she went blind because of infection.

2721
01:57:16,610 --> 01:57:17,090
Like why?

2722
01:57:18,130 --> 01:57:19,350
You can change...

2723
01:57:19,350 --> 01:57:23,810
You can tattoo your eye to change the color of your eyes.

2724
01:57:25,230 --> 01:57:27,470
Just fucking wear contacts.

2725
01:57:28,070 --> 01:57:30,070
Like holy shit.

2726
01:57:30,150 --> 01:57:30,750
Like...

2727
01:57:30,750 --> 01:57:31,490
Just...

2728
01:57:31,490 --> 01:57:32,250
Some...

2729
01:57:32,250 --> 01:57:37,950
Some girl fucking tattooed her eye so she could change the color of her eye.

2730
01:57:38,470 --> 01:57:40,230
Just wear contacts.

2731
01:57:40,890 --> 01:57:42,990
There's colored contacts.

2732
01:57:46,730 --> 01:57:47,610
Anyway...

2733
01:57:47,610 --> 01:57:48,970
She went...

2734
01:57:48,970 --> 01:57:51,550
She went blind because...

2735
01:57:51,550 --> 01:57:52,050
Uh...

2736
01:57:52,430 --> 01:57:54,250
Because she fucking...

2737
01:57:54,250 --> 01:57:56,130
They got an infection.

2738
01:57:59,130 --> 01:57:59,670
Uh...

2739
01:57:59,670 --> 01:58:00,090
Um...

2740
01:58:00,090 --> 01:58:01,070
Alright.

2741
01:58:01,810 --> 01:58:02,270
Uh...

2742
01:58:02,270 --> 01:58:02,890
Breezy.

2747
01:58:08,130 --> 01:58:08,650
Thank you.

2748
01:58:08,650 --> 01:58:08,810
Maria.

2749
01:58:09,210 --> 01:58:10,970
I don't want the piercing in the...

2750
01:58:10,970 --> 01:58:11,230
Nope.

2751
01:58:11,290 --> 01:58:12,570
Thank you for the super chat.

2752
01:58:12,690 --> 01:58:13,110
Thank you.

2753
01:58:13,150 --> 01:58:13,830
Thank you.

2754
01:58:15,990 --> 01:58:16,530
Alright.

2755
01:58:18,810 --> 01:58:19,350
Ah!

2756
01:58:19,630 --> 01:58:20,570
I guess...

2757
01:58:20,570 --> 01:58:20,850
Ah!

2758
01:58:20,950 --> 01:58:22,170
I guess I'll go with tattoo.

2759
01:58:22,670 --> 01:58:23,530
I feel...

2760
01:58:23,530 --> 01:58:23,990
Oh my gosh.

2761
01:58:24,010 --> 01:58:25,150
But pain wise...

2762
01:58:25,150 --> 01:58:25,590
Okay.

2763
01:58:25,650 --> 01:58:26,110
They're pain wise.

2764
01:58:26,110 --> 01:58:27,330
They're both painful too.

2765
01:58:27,910 --> 01:58:28,870
Cause like...

2766
01:58:28,870 --> 01:58:33,010
There's like parts of your body for tattoos that's like super painful to get.

2767
01:58:33,370 --> 01:58:34,150
Oh my...

2768
01:58:34,150 --> 01:58:34,990
They're so terrible.

2769
01:58:35,050 --> 01:58:35,990
They're both such terrible.

2770
01:58:35,990 --> 01:58:37,650
Two things to pick from.

2771
01:58:37,930 --> 01:58:39,410
I guess I'll go...

2772
01:58:39,410 --> 01:58:41,350
I guess I'll go tattoos.

2773
01:58:41,510 --> 01:58:42,910
I'll just never go outside.

2774
01:58:43,350 --> 01:58:44,290
I'll just...

2775
01:58:44,290 --> 01:58:53,010
I guess I'll get tattoos and I'll also be on Ripley's Believe It or Not and the Guinness Book of Records.

2776
01:58:53,330 --> 01:58:54,170
I'll just do that.

2777
01:58:54,350 --> 01:58:55,950
There's like people who get like...

2778
01:58:55,950 --> 01:58:56,650
Oh my gosh.

2779
01:58:56,670 --> 01:58:59,670
The body modification stuff is actually wild.

2780
01:59:00,230 --> 01:59:02,270
It's fucking wild now.

2781
01:59:02,430 --> 01:59:03,730
Like I remember back then...

2782
01:59:04,630 --> 01:59:12,230
Cause back then as a little dokey I would collect like Ripley's Believe It or Not and like Guinness Book of Records and stuff like that.

2783
01:59:12,390 --> 01:59:16,610
And like there was some fucking wild shit where people would get like...

2784
01:59:16,610 --> 01:59:16,690
Yeah.

2785
01:59:16,750 --> 01:59:17,450
Lizard man.

2786
01:59:17,610 --> 01:59:22,670
There was like lizard man and like that guy that had like the whole skull thing.

2787
01:59:22,870 --> 01:59:23,250
You know?

2788
01:59:23,270 --> 01:59:23,710
Like the...

2789
01:59:23,710 --> 01:59:23,890
The...

2790
01:59:23,890 --> 01:59:24,250
The...

2791
01:59:24,250 --> 01:59:24,890
The...

2792
01:59:24,890 --> 01:59:24,950
The...

2793
01:59:24,950 --> 01:59:25,010
The...

2794
01:59:25,010 --> 01:59:28,750
He tattooed himself so that he looked like some fucking skull kid or whatever.

2795
01:59:29,050 --> 01:59:29,930
And there...

2796
01:59:29,930 --> 01:59:32,030
I'm just like thinking like you can get some...

2797
01:59:32,030 --> 01:59:39,270
There's like uh one person who tried to get plastic surgery to look like a Ken doll or a Barbie girl.

2798
01:59:39,490 --> 01:59:42,330
And like it's fucking...

2799
01:59:42,330 --> 01:59:43,770
Oh my god is this the same song?

2800
01:59:44,050 --> 01:59:45,670
I swear to god.

2801
01:59:45,730 --> 01:59:46,370
Am I list...

2802
01:59:46,370 --> 01:59:48,150
It's the same one.

2803
01:59:51,290 --> 01:59:53,530
Why does it keep going?

2804
01:59:53,530 --> 01:59:53,690
I don't know.

2805
01:59:53,690 --> 01:59:54,810
We are going back to this.

2806
01:59:55,030 --> 01:59:56,770
Oh my god.

2807
01:59:57,050 --> 01:59:58,810
Okay, I'm not gonna do shuffle anymore.

2808
01:59:59,290 --> 02:00:02,450
It keeps going back to that one song.

2809
02:00:04,690 --> 02:00:08,090
Oh my god, we're gonna go crazy here.

2810
02:00:08,310 --> 02:00:08,850
Alright.

2811
02:00:11,450 --> 02:00:12,170
Anyway.

2812
02:00:12,170 --> 02:00:12,890
Um...

2813
02:00:14,370 --> 02:00:17,490
I know like people have been doing some fucking...

2814
02:00:18,570 --> 02:00:20,730
weird ass body modifications.

2815
02:00:21,810 --> 02:00:22,290
Alright.

2816
02:00:22,290 --> 02:00:25,070
Return every non-essential item you've ever bought.

2817
02:00:25,190 --> 02:00:28,090
Never be able to buy anything non-essential again.

2818
02:00:30,690 --> 02:00:31,170
Wait.

2819
02:00:31,170 --> 02:00:33,850
That just means like I'll... That's just this but worse.

2820
02:00:38,230 --> 02:00:40,190
Isn't that just this but worse?

2821
02:00:40,710 --> 02:00:42,930
Like I have to return everything, right?

2822
02:00:43,330 --> 02:00:45,030
But does that mean I can buy more?

2823
02:00:45,330 --> 02:00:46,470
Oh, then get it back.

2824
02:00:47,630 --> 02:00:48,550
Oh, okay.

2825
02:00:48,630 --> 02:00:49,750
Then I can just buy it back.

2826
02:00:49,910 --> 02:00:50,630
Then that's fine.

2827
02:00:50,730 --> 02:00:52,890
Like non-essential items?

2828
02:00:53,230 --> 02:00:54,530
I can't buy toilet... Wait.

2829
02:00:54,630 --> 02:00:56,130
Is toilet paper considered non-essential?

2830
02:00:56,670 --> 02:00:57,230
Right?

2831
02:01:00,030 --> 02:01:02,250
Is toilet paper considered non-essential?

2832
02:01:02,970 --> 02:01:05,230
Cause like you don't really need toilet paper.

2833
02:01:05,350 --> 02:01:06,990
You can just get like a bidet.

2834
02:01:11,190 --> 02:01:13,410
That's... That's the... I guess like...

2835
02:01:14,630 --> 02:01:16,730
You can just use the shower like...

2836
02:01:16,730 --> 02:01:17,130
Like...

2837
02:01:19,590 --> 02:01:20,210
Let's see.

2838
02:01:20,510 --> 02:01:22,090
Essential if no bidet.

2839
02:01:22,110 --> 02:01:22,870
Bidet is better.

2840
02:01:23,430 --> 02:01:23,750
Um.

2841
02:01:23,930 --> 02:01:27,050
I remember there was like the South Park episode where like the toilet paper comp...

2842
02:01:27,050 --> 02:01:27,650
Cause like...

2843
02:01:28,470 --> 02:01:30,350
NA is like one of the only...

2844
02:01:31,730 --> 02:01:33,730
places where bidet is not common.

2845
02:01:35,570 --> 02:01:39,210
But bidet is actually healthier for your skin as well.

2846
02:01:39,210 --> 02:01:40,270
Cause like the paper...

2847
02:01:40,270 --> 02:01:44,270
The toilet paper like actually is not good for your skin and stuff.

2848
02:01:44,270 --> 02:01:46,310
Like bidet is actually better.

2849
02:01:46,530 --> 02:01:49,530
But the fucking toilet paper companies...

2850
02:01:49,530 --> 02:01:53,290
I'm pretty sure the toilet paper company just has a huge monopoly.

2851
02:01:56,230 --> 02:01:56,730
Yeah.

2852
02:01:56,890 --> 02:01:57,090
No.

2853
02:01:57,170 --> 02:01:57,570
It's true.

2854
02:01:57,730 --> 02:01:59,770
If you use like dry toilet paper...

2855
02:01:59,770 --> 02:02:01,650
It's actually worse for your skin.

2856
02:02:03,390 --> 02:02:08,810
And like you have to use like baby wipes or... Cause like you have to... The paper has to be wet.

2857
02:02:12,550 --> 02:02:15,590
It's actually really bad for your butt.

2858
02:02:15,850 --> 02:02:16,430
Like...

2859
02:02:16,430 --> 02:02:18,890
I'll just... I'll just say that.

2860
02:02:19,230 --> 02:02:23,310
Toilet paper is actually pretty bad for your butt.

2861
02:02:27,230 --> 02:02:29,750
So... So... Um...

2862
02:02:30,470 --> 02:02:36,010
It's actually better to use like bidets or like baby wipes.

2863
02:02:36,230 --> 02:02:38,170
But baby wipes is also really bad.

2864
02:02:38,790 --> 02:02:42,670
For... I think like... I think like they say like baby wipes is really bad for...

2865
02:02:42,670 --> 02:02:44,590
Um... The pipes and stuff.

2866
02:02:45,230 --> 02:02:46,190
Uh... But yeah.

2867
02:02:46,330 --> 02:02:49,210
Like it's actually healthier to use a bidet.

2868
02:02:50,550 --> 02:02:54,490
Um... And... And I just wish bidets were popular... More popular.

2869
02:02:55,050 --> 02:02:55,810
In NA.

2870
02:02:55,910 --> 02:02:57,850
I just wish bidets were more popular in NA.

2871
02:02:58,030 --> 02:03:01,190
I miss bidets so much ever since like you know when you go to Japan.

2872
02:03:01,570 --> 02:03:02,650
And you have a bidet.

2873
02:03:02,750 --> 02:03:03,970
And then you go back.

2874
02:03:03,990 --> 02:03:05,050
And then you're like...

2875
02:03:05,610 --> 02:03:07,070
I feel like a caveman.

2876
02:03:11,410 --> 02:03:16,630
I... I fucking feel like a caveman every time I come back.

2877
02:03:16,850 --> 02:03:18,090
Like... Yeah.

2878
02:03:18,150 --> 02:03:19,470
Do not flush baby wipes.

2879
02:03:19,550 --> 02:03:21,150
It's very bad for your pipes.

2880
02:03:21,310 --> 02:03:22,270
By the way.

2881
02:03:22,490 --> 02:03:25,270
It... It's... It's very bad.

2882
02:03:30,350 --> 02:03:30,990
Um...

2883
02:03:33,130 --> 02:03:34,410
Um... But yeah.

2884
02:03:34,490 --> 02:03:35,610
I just... God.

2885
02:03:36,290 --> 02:03:37,870
I'm gonna say this one.

2886
02:03:37,870 --> 02:03:38,950
I'm not gonna make a pose for this.

2887
02:03:39,050 --> 02:03:39,930
Because I feel like...

2888
02:03:39,930 --> 02:03:43,670
That's so fucked up if I can't buy anything non-essential again.

2889
02:03:44,350 --> 02:03:48,110
Break into a stranger's home and stay for two days without them knowing.

2890
02:03:48,430 --> 02:03:50,610
Stay... Why the fuck would... Why?

2891
02:03:50,970 --> 02:03:52,270
Why would I go outside?

2892
02:03:52,870 --> 02:03:53,210
Bro.

2893
02:03:53,310 --> 02:03:55,170
I'm not gonna debate about this.

2894
02:03:55,510 --> 02:03:56,570
This is terrible.

2895
02:03:57,050 --> 02:03:58,230
They won't know.

2896
02:03:58,990 --> 02:03:59,550
Like...

2897
02:03:59,550 --> 02:04:01,570
They won't know.

2898
02:04:02,790 --> 02:04:04,550
It's like I was never there.

2899
02:04:04,950 --> 02:04:05,470
Exactly.

2900
02:04:05,470 --> 02:04:06,670
They won't know.

2901
02:04:06,670 --> 02:04:08,650
I just leave after two days.

2902
02:04:09,070 --> 02:04:10,950
After they... They won't know.

2903
02:04:14,750 --> 02:04:16,570
Literally break into a mansion.

2904
02:04:17,110 --> 02:04:18,390
Stay at Bill Gates' mansion.

2905
02:04:18,670 --> 02:04:19,470
He has so many.

2906
02:04:19,470 --> 02:04:20,170
He wouldn't care.

2907
02:04:20,410 --> 02:04:22,090
He has so many fucking vacation homes.

2908
02:04:22,450 --> 02:04:25,310
I literally break into one of Bill Gates' vacation homes.

2909
02:04:25,590 --> 02:04:26,950
Stay there for two days.

2910
02:04:27,030 --> 02:04:27,850
And then leave.

2911
02:04:28,070 --> 02:04:28,930
How would they know?

2912
02:04:29,310 --> 02:04:30,510
Not even need a poll.

2913
02:04:30,890 --> 02:04:32,410
I don't need a vote for this.

2914
02:04:33,150 --> 02:04:33,630
Alright.

2915
02:04:34,210 --> 02:04:35,470
What the fuck we want...

2916
02:04:35,470 --> 02:04:36,630
These people just love nature.

2917
02:04:36,870 --> 02:04:38,210
Drink hot drinks in summer.

2918
02:04:38,210 --> 02:04:38,990
Drink cold drinks.

2919
02:04:39,010 --> 02:04:39,670
Drink cold drinks.

2920
02:04:39,750 --> 02:04:40,330
Not gonna debate.

2921
02:04:40,590 --> 02:04:41,970
I already do this anyway.

2922
02:04:42,810 --> 02:04:43,310
Um...

2923
02:04:44,730 --> 02:04:46,190
I already do this anyway.

2924
02:04:46,630 --> 02:04:47,730
Like I don't care.

2925
02:04:49,450 --> 02:04:53,470
Hot drinks in summer feels so much worse than cold drinks in winter.

2926
02:04:53,870 --> 02:04:54,370
Um...

2927
02:04:54,370 --> 02:04:56,070
I just choose cold drinks in winter.

2928
02:04:56,150 --> 02:04:57,770
I feel like this is fucking terrible.

2929
02:05:00,270 --> 02:05:03,530
I could be inside and drink cold drinks.

2930
02:05:03,730 --> 02:05:05,570
Tell your best friend all your secrets.

2931
02:05:05,570 --> 02:05:06,910
Tell your parents all...

2932
02:05:06,910 --> 02:05:07,330
Oh...

2933
02:05:07,330 --> 02:05:08,450
Oh...

2934
02:05:08,450 --> 02:05:10,770
I dare them to weaponize it.

2935
02:05:14,010 --> 02:05:15,050
Oh...

2936
02:05:16,910 --> 02:05:18,750
That is difficult.

2937
02:05:19,410 --> 02:05:21,450
That is actually difficult.

2938
02:05:22,310 --> 02:05:23,350
Parents...

2939
02:05:23,350 --> 02:05:24,910
Secret...

2940
02:05:24,910 --> 02:05:25,210
Okay...

2941
02:05:25,210 --> 02:05:26,330
Best...

2942
02:05:26,330 --> 02:05:27,250
Friend...

2943
02:05:27,250 --> 02:05:28,470
Secrets...

2944
02:05:28,470 --> 02:05:29,510
Versus...

2945
02:05:29,510 --> 02:05:31,170
Parents...

2946
02:05:31,170 --> 02:05:33,190
Best...

2947
02:05:33,190 --> 02:05:34,330
Friend...

2948
02:05:36,050 --> 02:05:36,490
Parents...

2949
02:05:37,510 --> 02:05:38,330
Both suck.

2950
02:05:38,430 --> 02:05:38,830
They do.

2951
02:05:39,010 --> 02:05:39,890
They do.

2952
02:05:42,590 --> 02:05:43,030
Okay.

2953
02:05:44,430 --> 02:05:44,870
Ah...

2954
02:05:45,690 --> 02:05:46,130
Alright.

2955
02:05:46,190 --> 02:05:47,010
I feel...

2956
02:05:47,850 --> 02:05:48,290
Parents...

2957
02:05:48,290 --> 02:05:49,130
Best...

2958
02:05:50,550 --> 02:05:50,990
Friend...

2959
02:05:51,670 --> 02:05:52,110
Okay.

2960
02:05:52,130 --> 02:05:52,330
Wait.

2961
02:05:52,490 --> 02:05:53,730
Tom, thank you for the super chat.

2962
02:05:53,790 --> 02:05:54,070
Thank you.

2963
02:05:54,070 --> 02:05:54,370
Thank you.

2964
02:05:54,390 --> 02:05:56,410
Doki, he lives in a Bill-gated community.

2965
02:05:56,830 --> 02:05:58,490
You'll never get in.

2966
02:05:58,950 --> 02:06:00,450
Thank you for the super chat.

2967
02:06:00,550 --> 02:06:00,850
Thank you.

2968
02:06:00,890 --> 02:06:01,270
Thank you.

2969
02:06:01,310 --> 02:06:03,290
I could be Bill Gates like...

2970
02:06:03,730 --> 02:06:04,170
Like...

2971
02:06:04,170 --> 02:06:05,010
Don...

2972
02:06:05,010 --> 02:06:05,450
Lost...

2973
02:06:05,450 --> 02:06:05,550
Like...

2974
02:06:05,550 --> 02:06:06,430
Cousin...

2975
02:06:06,430 --> 02:06:07,770
Five times removed.

2976
02:06:07,950 --> 02:06:09,090
You don't know that.

2977
02:06:09,370 --> 02:06:10,610
You don't know that.

2978
02:06:10,630 --> 02:06:11,750
You don't know my genetics.

2979
02:06:12,110 --> 02:06:13,510
Thank you for the super chat.

2980
02:06:13,630 --> 02:06:13,930
Thank you.

2981
02:06:13,950 --> 02:06:14,490
Thank you.

2982
02:06:14,570 --> 02:06:15,670
I feel like...

2983
02:06:15,670 --> 02:06:16,650
Parents...

2984
02:06:16,650 --> 02:06:18,110
Because I feel like...

2985
02:06:18,110 --> 02:06:18,590
Wait.

2986
02:06:18,650 --> 02:06:19,090
If you...

2987
02:06:19,090 --> 02:06:21,130
If you tell your best friend...

2988
02:06:21,130 --> 02:06:22,390
All your secrets...

2989
02:06:22,390 --> 02:06:24,530
And then they're no longer your best friend...

2990
02:06:24,530 --> 02:06:25,330
You're fucked.

2991
02:06:26,130 --> 02:06:28,050
You're so fucked.

2992
02:06:28,770 --> 02:06:29,370
Like...

2993
02:06:30,990 --> 02:06:32,010
Cause like...

2994
02:06:32,010 --> 02:06:34,170
You can lose friends...

2995
02:06:34,170 --> 02:06:35,530
Much more...

2996
02:06:35,530 --> 02:06:36,190
Much more easily...

2997
02:06:36,190 --> 02:06:37,510
Than parents.

2998
02:06:37,890 --> 02:06:38,310
Like...

2999
02:06:38,310 --> 02:06:39,090
I feel like...

3000
02:06:39,090 --> 02:06:39,830
Like...

3001
02:06:39,830 --> 02:06:40,370
You can...

3002
02:06:40,370 --> 02:06:40,870
You know...

3003
02:06:40,870 --> 02:06:41,270
I mean...

3004
02:06:41,270 --> 02:06:41,810
For parents...

3005
02:06:41,810 --> 02:06:42,710
You could be like...

3006
02:06:42,710 --> 02:06:43,610
Um...

3007
02:06:43,610 --> 02:06:44,550
What's that word?

3008
02:06:44,970 --> 02:06:46,270
Excommunicated from your parents.

3009
02:06:46,510 --> 02:06:47,430
But like...

3010
02:06:47,430 --> 02:06:49,290
There's a higher chance...

3011
02:06:49,290 --> 02:06:50,290
That you're...

3012
02:06:50,290 --> 02:06:51,650
You would lose your best friend...

3013
02:06:51,650 --> 02:06:52,510
Over...

3014
02:06:52,510 --> 02:06:53,250
Like...

3015
02:06:53,250 --> 02:06:54,350
Being ex...

3016
02:06:54,350 --> 02:06:54,590
Like...

3017
02:06:54,590 --> 02:06:55,970
Getting kicked out by your parents.

3018
02:06:56,770 --> 02:06:57,670
Someone's like...

3019
02:06:57,670 --> 02:06:58,510
You're Asian!

3020
02:06:58,910 --> 02:07:00,310
What does that matter?

3021
02:07:00,770 --> 02:07:02,190
Even if I get like...

3022
02:07:02,850 --> 02:07:03,450
Disowned...

3023
02:07:03,450 --> 02:07:04,750
From my parents...

3024
02:07:04,750 --> 02:07:06,210
It's less likely...

3025
02:07:06,950 --> 02:07:07,550
Um...

3026
02:07:07,550 --> 02:07:09,730
It's less likely to happen...

3027
02:07:09,730 --> 02:07:10,690
Versus getting...

3028
02:07:10,690 --> 02:07:10,990
Like...

3029
02:07:10,990 --> 02:07:12,110
Losing your best friend.

3030
02:07:12,350 --> 02:07:12,870
Like...

3031
02:07:14,010 --> 02:07:16,270
It's easier to lose friends...

3032
02:07:16,270 --> 02:07:17,850
Than to be disowned.

3033
02:07:18,730 --> 02:07:19,030
Like...

3034
02:07:19,330 --> 02:07:20,470
What if I tell like...

3035
02:07:20,470 --> 02:07:21,050
The best friend...

3036
02:07:21,050 --> 02:07:22,950
Something so fucked up...

3037
02:07:22,950 --> 02:07:23,890
That they're like...

3038
02:07:23,890 --> 02:07:25,410
I can't be your best friend anymore.

3039
02:07:25,770 --> 02:07:28,430
And then they tell people about that fucked up secret.

3040
02:07:28,950 --> 02:07:29,550
Like...

3041
02:07:29,550 --> 02:07:30,750
If I tell my parents...

3042
02:07:30,750 --> 02:07:31,370
Okay...

3043
02:07:31,370 --> 02:07:33,410
Something super fucked up...

3044
02:07:33,410 --> 02:07:34,150
It was like...

3045
02:07:34,150 --> 02:07:34,730
I murdered my parents.

3046
02:07:35,390 --> 02:07:36,330
They'll be like...

3047
02:07:36,330 --> 02:07:36,550
I didn't...

3048
02:07:36,550 --> 02:07:37,570
How do we hide the body?

3049
02:07:38,310 --> 02:07:39,570
You could be like...

3050
02:07:39,570 --> 02:07:41,030
But best friends will do that too.

3051
02:07:41,090 --> 02:07:41,670
Best friends will...

3052
02:07:41,670 --> 02:07:42,610
You could say...

3053
02:07:42,610 --> 02:07:43,290
Best friends...

3054
02:07:43,290 --> 02:07:44,350
Will help you hide the body.

3055
02:07:44,550 --> 02:07:45,810
But will they really?

3056
02:07:46,150 --> 02:07:46,670
Will they...

3057
02:07:46,670 --> 02:07:47,110
Would...

3058
02:07:47,110 --> 02:07:49,570
It's so easy to say that.

3059
02:07:50,150 --> 02:07:55,010
It's so easy for a friend who's not related to you say that.

3060
02:07:55,250 --> 02:07:57,430
But will they really do it?

3061
02:07:57,490 --> 02:07:59,950
The thing is, they can...

3062
02:07:59,950 --> 02:08:03,210
They don't have to hide the body, because they'll be like...

3063
02:08:03,210 --> 02:08:04,730
Well, if I just pretend I never knew you.

3064
02:08:04,730 --> 02:08:05,710
I won't be involved.

3065
02:08:06,190 --> 02:08:08,010
But the parents wise...

3066
02:08:08,490 --> 02:08:11,610
Parents, if you kill somebody, they need to help you.

3067
02:08:11,690 --> 02:08:14,730
Because their reputation is connected to you.

3068
02:08:14,850 --> 02:08:18,450
Because they don't want to be the parents of the daughter who committed murder.

3069
02:08:20,230 --> 02:08:20,750
Like...

3070
02:08:23,390 --> 02:08:23,910
They...

3071
02:08:23,910 --> 02:08:26,270
Their reputation is on the line.

3072
02:08:26,550 --> 02:08:28,690
Because they'll also be in the articles too.

3073
02:08:28,810 --> 02:08:34,250
They'll be like, oh my god, how could this parent raise a monster who murdered like five people.

3074
02:08:36,230 --> 02:08:39,430
So they have to hide the body for you.

3075
02:08:39,650 --> 02:08:42,150
Because they don't want that to be on the line.

3076
02:08:42,470 --> 02:08:49,970
But then your best friend, if you kill somebody, they'll be like, holy fuck, I'm gonna call the police because I don't wanna be like...

3077
02:08:49,970 --> 02:08:51,430
Because they'll have to go to trial.

3078
02:08:51,970 --> 02:08:53,470
They'll have to go to trial.

3079
02:08:53,650 --> 02:08:55,990
And like, they'll have to go to jail for being involved.

3080
02:08:56,330 --> 02:08:58,070
And they're not even related to me.

3081
02:08:58,410 --> 02:09:00,230
Why would they want to hide the body?

3082
02:09:00,330 --> 02:09:01,370
They're not related to me.

3083
02:09:01,370 --> 02:09:03,310
They cannot even have to...

3084
02:09:03,310 --> 02:09:05,370
They won't have to be in trial for anything.

3085
02:09:05,810 --> 02:09:07,290
Or like, be involved.

3086
02:09:07,370 --> 02:09:08,490
Or go to jail.

3087
02:09:08,910 --> 02:09:09,750
And everything.

3088
02:09:11,150 --> 02:09:11,630
So...

3089
02:09:12,290 --> 02:09:13,470
I'll tell the parents.

3090
02:09:13,690 --> 02:09:15,630
You guys would tell your best friend?

3091
02:09:16,110 --> 02:09:17,490
All your secrets?

3092
02:09:18,350 --> 02:09:19,170
Like, really?

3093
02:09:19,330 --> 02:09:21,750
Why would you guys tell your best friend over your parents?

3094
02:09:22,410 --> 02:09:24,410
I feel like you might have a secret.

3095
02:09:24,590 --> 02:09:25,370
Like, if you're like...

3096
02:09:25,370 --> 02:09:27,010
It's like all your secrets.

3097
02:09:27,070 --> 02:09:28,470
You can't all be fucking clean.

3098
02:09:28,470 --> 02:09:29,250
Like...

3099
02:09:34,390 --> 02:09:35,910
Thank you for the super chat.

3100
02:09:35,970 --> 02:09:36,250
Thank you.

3101
02:09:36,270 --> 02:09:36,630
Thank you.

3102
02:09:36,630 --> 02:09:38,170
One of my best friend is a pig.

3103
02:09:38,250 --> 02:09:40,350
Pigs are perfect for hiding a body.

3104
02:09:40,510 --> 02:09:42,150
They would just eat it.

3105
02:09:42,210 --> 02:09:43,450
Thank you for the super chat.

3106
02:09:43,590 --> 02:09:43,970
Thank you.

3107
02:09:43,990 --> 02:09:44,490
Thank you.

3108
02:09:44,550 --> 02:09:45,890
I trust your friend.

3109
02:09:45,990 --> 02:09:47,290
Do you... Okay.

3110
02:09:48,270 --> 02:09:50,150
You can't be fully clean.

3111
02:09:50,370 --> 02:09:50,810
Come on.

3112
02:09:53,250 --> 02:09:57,650
I got no secrets that would send me to jail.

3113
02:10:00,770 --> 02:10:01,330
Okay.

3114
02:10:02,650 --> 02:10:03,830
I'm just saying.

3115
02:10:04,350 --> 02:10:05,790
I'm just saying.

3116
02:10:07,510 --> 02:10:11,410
Because I don't want my parents to know what I watch at night.

3117
02:10:11,590 --> 02:10:13,690
Thank you for the super chat.

3118
02:10:13,930 --> 02:10:14,690
Thank you.

3119
02:10:14,710 --> 02:10:15,430
Thank you.

3120
02:10:18,150 --> 02:10:19,990
I have no enemies.

3121
02:10:20,170 --> 02:10:20,630
I mean...

3122
02:10:20,630 --> 02:10:23,150
My friend won't judge me as much.

3123
02:10:23,490 --> 02:10:25,110
I guess you could say that.

3124
02:10:25,230 --> 02:10:26,130
Your friend won't judge.

3125
02:10:26,290 --> 02:10:28,310
But then, what if you're not friends anymore?

3126
02:10:28,410 --> 02:10:28,450
I'm not friends anymore.

3127
02:10:28,470 --> 02:10:30,310
What if you're not friends anymore?

3128
02:10:30,790 --> 02:10:32,270
And they know all of that.

3129
02:10:35,350 --> 02:10:36,230
My friend...

3130
02:10:36,230 --> 02:10:37,870
I like how someone's like, don't worry.

3131
02:10:38,010 --> 02:10:40,770
My friend has done way worse stuff than me.

3132
02:10:40,790 --> 02:10:41,910
So I'm fine with that.

3133
02:10:42,690 --> 02:10:46,930
If my parents knew everything, I would disappear.

3134
02:10:50,590 --> 02:10:51,030
Okay.

3135
02:10:51,030 --> 02:10:51,470
Unimportant.

3136
02:10:51,710 --> 02:10:52,450
Thank you for the super chat.

3137
02:10:52,550 --> 02:10:52,810
Thank you.

3138
02:10:52,830 --> 02:10:53,410
Thank you.

3139
02:10:53,590 --> 02:10:54,770
I changed my mind.

3140
02:10:54,830 --> 02:10:57,070
If I had friends, they would probably be as weird as me.

3141
02:10:58,470 --> 02:11:01,430
My parents said they would go to the police.

3142
02:11:01,850 --> 02:11:03,050
My parents said they would go to the police.

3143
02:11:03,050 --> 02:11:04,010
You don't know that.

3144
02:11:04,070 --> 02:11:04,950
It's all like...

3145
02:11:04,950 --> 02:11:13,590
You know deep down, your parents do not want to be the parents of a son or daughter that murdered somebody.

3146
02:11:14,410 --> 02:11:15,810
You know deep down, your parents do not want to be the parents of a son or daughter that murdered somebody.

3147
02:11:15,830 --> 02:11:16,710
You know deep down, your parents do not want to be the parents of a son or daughter that murdered somebody.

3148
02:11:17,270 --> 02:11:17,870
You know deep down, your parents do not want to be the parents of a son or daughter that murdered somebody.

3149
02:11:17,870 --> 02:11:17,890
You know deep down, your parents do not want to be the parents of a son or daughter that murdered somebody.

3150
02:11:17,890 --> 02:11:18,870
They say that.

3151
02:11:18,890 --> 02:11:24,530
But you know deep down, they don't want to be in the article as the parent that raised a monster.

3152
02:11:24,810 --> 02:11:25,030
They don't want to be in the article as the parent that raised a monster.

3153
02:11:25,030 --> 02:11:25,410
They don't...

3154
02:11:28,950 --> 02:11:31,630
My dad is a cop.

3155
02:11:38,770 --> 02:11:41,570
Mercy, thank you for the super chat.

3156
02:11:41,730 --> 02:11:42,130
Thank you.

3157
02:11:42,150 --> 02:11:42,770
Thank you.

3158
02:11:43,530 --> 02:11:47,670
As long as you know what felonies your friends have committed, you'll always part ways.

3159
02:11:50,230 --> 02:11:51,490
Thank you for the super chat.

3160
02:11:51,610 --> 02:11:51,930
Thank you.

3161
02:11:51,950 --> 02:11:52,630
Thank you.

3162
02:11:52,970 --> 02:11:55,630
My parents were in it with pride.

3163
02:11:56,170 --> 02:11:56,610
Okay.

3164
02:11:56,790 --> 02:11:59,810
I guess I was like, my parents are very good at avoiding accountability.

3165
02:12:00,430 --> 02:12:01,610
They'll still be in the end.

3166
02:12:02,430 --> 02:12:10,670
They'll be fucking in the articles being like, these are the parents that raised a child who murdered five people in five different states.

3167
02:12:10,910 --> 02:12:12,630
They'll still be in the article.

3168
02:12:14,050 --> 02:12:16,670
They will be like, that's the best friend.

3169
02:12:16,970 --> 02:12:23,970
No one cares about that's the best friend who was the friend of the murderer that murdered five people in five different states.

3170
02:12:24,250 --> 02:12:25,270
No one would say that.

3171
02:12:25,490 --> 02:12:27,130
Everyone would always mention the parents.

3172
02:12:29,650 --> 02:12:31,130
Is this a good...

3173
02:12:31,630 --> 02:12:33,850
No, guys, it's all figuratively.

3174
02:12:33,990 --> 02:12:40,290
It's like, what if I did he he like, you know, what if I did murder five people in five different states?

3175
02:12:40,450 --> 02:12:41,090
He he.

3176
02:12:43,130 --> 02:12:44,870
Michael, thank you for the super chat.

3177
02:12:44,950 --> 02:12:45,270
Thank you.

3178
02:12:45,270 --> 02:12:45,870
Thank you.

3179
02:12:46,070 --> 02:12:48,730
What if I told my best friend my darkest secret?

3180
02:12:49,350 --> 02:12:50,470
They'd call me basic.

3181
02:12:50,570 --> 02:12:51,610
Thank you for the super chat.

3182
02:12:51,790 --> 02:12:52,270
Thank you.

3183
02:12:52,290 --> 02:12:53,030
Thank you.

3184
02:12:53,050 --> 02:12:56,370
I would tell my parents all my secrets.

3185
02:12:56,830 --> 02:12:57,970
I do that.

3186
02:12:57,970 --> 02:13:00,130
It's all hypothetical situation.

3187
02:13:00,510 --> 02:13:01,410
This is all hypothetical.

3188
02:13:01,550 --> 02:13:02,050
Really?

3189
02:13:02,230 --> 02:13:03,710
I'm the 35%?

3190
02:13:04,750 --> 02:13:05,370
You guys...

3191
02:13:07,190 --> 02:13:09,630
You guys just don't understand me.

3192
02:13:10,050 --> 02:13:10,490
All right.

3193
02:13:10,890 --> 02:13:16,290
Always have a random taste in your mouth or be unable to have taste in your mouth.

3194
02:13:16,570 --> 02:13:18,130
Oh, they all suck.

3195
02:13:18,250 --> 02:13:20,090
I hate either of these options.

3196
02:13:22,670 --> 02:13:24,390
I hate either of these.

3197
02:13:24,610 --> 02:13:26,250
They all fucking suck.

3198
02:13:29,510 --> 02:13:33,530
I feel like, damn, Dragoons be busy with all these murders.

3199
02:13:33,830 --> 02:13:35,270
Marth, thank you for the super chat.

3200
02:13:35,350 --> 02:13:35,630
Thank you.

3201
02:13:35,650 --> 02:13:36,210
Thank you.

3202
02:13:37,370 --> 02:13:38,950
Darkblade, thank you for the super chat.

3203
02:13:39,010 --> 02:13:39,290
Thank you.

3204
02:13:39,310 --> 02:13:39,670
Thank you.

3205
02:13:39,670 --> 02:13:42,310
I don't know if I want my parents to find out how much I spent on...

3206
02:13:42,310 --> 02:13:43,470
Is that a secret?

3207
02:13:43,750 --> 02:13:46,070
How is that deep dark secret, Darkblade?

3208
02:13:46,150 --> 02:13:47,930
Thank you for the super chat.

3209
02:13:48,030 --> 02:13:48,410
Thank you.

3210
02:13:48,450 --> 02:13:49,070
Thank you.

3211
02:13:50,090 --> 02:13:53,030
Um, one is always... Oh my God.

3212
02:13:54,890 --> 02:13:55,930
Why are you ashamed?

3213
02:13:56,650 --> 02:13:58,310
Darkblade, how dare you?

3214
02:13:58,310 --> 02:14:01,190
How could you be ashamed, Darkblade?

3215
02:14:03,730 --> 02:14:05,010
I don't know.

3216
02:14:05,230 --> 02:14:06,550
They're all terrible.

3217
02:14:07,430 --> 02:14:09,470
I don't like either of them.

3218
02:14:09,610 --> 02:14:12,650
I feel I'm not gonna make a poll for this one, but I feel like...

3219
02:14:14,290 --> 02:14:17,950
I guess... I guess I'll like get used to it.

3220
02:14:18,130 --> 02:14:20,030
It could be a random good taste.

3221
02:14:20,210 --> 02:14:21,130
Yeah, it's gotcha.

3222
02:14:21,250 --> 02:14:22,530
You know, life is wild.

3223
02:14:23,850 --> 02:14:25,650
Life is fucking wild.

3224
02:14:25,930 --> 02:14:26,750
It's like gotcha.

3225
02:14:29,210 --> 02:14:29,770
Alright.

3226
02:14:30,230 --> 02:14:33,170
Face a zombie apocalypse or face a robot?

3227
02:14:33,450 --> 02:14:34,530
Okay, this one's interesting.

3228
02:14:35,830 --> 02:14:38,230
Zombies versus robots.

3229
02:14:39,810 --> 02:14:40,370
Zombies.

3230
02:14:41,810 --> 02:14:42,370
Robots.

3231
02:14:43,670 --> 02:14:44,910
I'd say like...

3232
02:14:45,690 --> 02:14:46,810
I'd say one.

3233
02:14:47,090 --> 02:14:48,330
I'd say zombies.

3234
02:14:49,610 --> 02:14:52,270
Alright, fanfiction already have no taste.

3235
02:14:52,670 --> 02:14:54,110
Tom, thank you for the super chat.

3236
02:14:54,190 --> 02:14:54,470
Thank you.

3237
02:14:54,510 --> 02:14:54,890
Thank you.

3238
02:14:54,890 --> 02:14:57,130
I'd say zombies over robots.

3239
02:14:57,510 --> 02:15:00,470
Because robots, you can't use any technology ever again.

3240
02:15:00,770 --> 02:15:03,010
Because robots would just like use it.

3241
02:15:03,070 --> 02:15:05,690
You know, like robots will like take over all sense of...

3242
02:15:05,690 --> 02:15:06,830
It's just Y2K.

3243
02:15:08,650 --> 02:15:13,810
It's literally what if Y2K happened and the robots just take over the world.

3244
02:15:14,090 --> 02:15:19,090
And like I feel like robots having that much power is a lot worse than zombies.

3245
02:15:19,210 --> 02:15:21,030
Because zombies are brainless in the end.

3246
02:15:21,130 --> 02:15:22,350
And they're easier to kill.

3247
02:15:22,570 --> 02:15:23,130
Robots!

3248
02:15:23,130 --> 02:15:25,150
You can shoot your gun at a robot.

3249
02:15:25,390 --> 02:15:26,990
It doesn't mean they're fucking dead.

3250
02:15:27,130 --> 02:15:29,170
You have to like fry their circuits or something.

3251
02:15:29,350 --> 02:15:30,930
Or like Skynet.

3252
02:15:30,970 --> 02:15:32,790
Yeah, it's like Skynet and Y2K.

3253
02:15:33,130 --> 02:15:37,150
And honestly, what if the robots are hot?

3254
02:15:37,310 --> 02:15:38,590
If evil, why hot?

3255
02:15:38,750 --> 02:15:39,710
Thank you for the super chat.

3256
02:15:39,770 --> 02:15:40,110
Thank you.

3257
02:15:40,150 --> 02:15:40,670
Thank you.

3258
02:15:40,750 --> 02:15:42,270
There can be hot zombies.

3259
02:15:42,410 --> 02:15:43,990
What happened to that warm bodies?

3260
02:15:44,250 --> 02:15:45,870
Remember that fucking zombie...

3261
02:15:46,430 --> 02:15:46,950
Zombie...

3262
02:15:48,490 --> 02:15:52,030
Romantic movie about like having a zombie boyfriend?

3263
02:15:52,030 --> 02:15:53,210
Like...

3264
02:15:53,210 --> 02:15:55,630
They can both be hot.

3265
02:16:00,750 --> 02:16:01,390
What?

3266
02:16:01,530 --> 02:16:02,330
Warm bodies!

3267
02:16:02,530 --> 02:16:03,790
That was a thing?

3268
02:16:04,650 --> 02:16:06,370
Warm bodies was a thing?

3269
02:16:07,270 --> 02:16:09,910
People wanted to fuck the zombie boyfriend.

3270
02:16:10,750 --> 02:16:12,070
I saw it.

3271
02:16:12,190 --> 02:16:13,210
It was on Tumblr.

3272
02:16:13,450 --> 02:16:14,310
I saw it.

3273
02:16:14,410 --> 02:16:17,210
People are so obsessed with the zombie boyfriend thing.

3274
02:16:19,510 --> 02:16:20,150
Anyway.

3275
02:16:20,150 --> 02:16:22,630
I would say...

3276
02:16:22,630 --> 02:16:23,930
Also Chris, thank you for the super chat.

3277
02:16:24,010 --> 02:16:24,230
Thank you.

3278
02:16:24,270 --> 02:16:24,830
Thank you.

3279
02:16:24,870 --> 02:16:28,970
A true dragoon always sacrifices their wad for the greater good.

3280
02:16:29,090 --> 02:16:30,770
Thank you for the super chat.

3281
02:16:30,910 --> 02:16:31,990
Thank you.

3282
02:16:32,310 --> 02:16:37,490
I would say... I would definitely say zombie apocalypse.

3283
02:16:37,870 --> 02:16:39,210
I feel like... Okay.

3284
02:16:39,550 --> 02:16:43,390
A robot apocalypse eventually... They can... Okay.

3285
02:16:43,430 --> 02:16:44,430
The thing is...

3286
02:16:44,430 --> 02:16:48,350
A robot apocalypse... They can just rebuild more robots.

3287
02:16:48,350 --> 02:16:49,690
That's the thing.

3288
02:16:49,930 --> 02:16:51,190
Like that's endless.

3289
02:16:51,630 --> 02:16:52,190
Zombies!

3290
02:16:52,190 --> 02:16:54,550
They just need to turn other people to zombies.

3291
02:16:54,870 --> 02:16:55,710
So like...

3292
02:16:55,710 --> 02:16:57,530
By then, you can find a...

3293
02:16:57,530 --> 02:17:00,610
You can find a cure for the zombie apocalypse.

3294
02:17:01,170 --> 02:17:04,190
I don't think you can find a cure for a robot apocalypse.

3295
02:17:04,370 --> 02:17:05,410
It's more endless.

3296
02:17:05,730 --> 02:17:07,230
Because they can just rebuild themselves.

3297
02:17:07,710 --> 02:17:10,090
Zombies can make more zombies but they require bodies.

3298
02:17:11,390 --> 02:17:12,890
They require bodies.

3299
02:17:15,630 --> 02:17:16,190
Um...

3300
02:17:16,190 --> 02:17:17,490
But like a robot apocalypse...

3301
02:17:17,490 --> 02:17:19,450
They'll just keep building robots.

3302
02:17:20,650 --> 02:17:22,390
There's more of a chance...

3303
02:17:22,390 --> 02:17:24,270
You can say EMP.

3304
02:17:24,710 --> 02:17:25,630
But like...

3305
02:17:25,630 --> 02:17:26,550
What if you...

3306
02:17:26,550 --> 02:17:28,410
There's always a possibility that...

3307
02:17:28,410 --> 02:17:31,010
That like a robot apocalypse will come back.

3308
02:17:31,270 --> 02:17:33,510
Like you can never trust technology again.

3309
02:17:34,670 --> 02:17:35,770
I don't like that.

3310
02:17:35,930 --> 02:17:38,450
I want to be able to use the internet while I'm in apocalypse.

3311
02:17:41,570 --> 02:17:42,550
Oh my god.

3312
02:17:42,650 --> 02:17:45,310
Think of the YouTube content you can get.

3313
02:17:47,490 --> 02:17:47,730
Haha.

3314
02:17:51,690 --> 02:17:53,130
Day 55.

3315
02:17:55,230 --> 02:17:56,750
On the search for supplies.

3316
02:17:59,230 --> 02:17:59,950
Like...

3317
02:18:00,370 --> 02:18:00,730
Okay...

3318
02:18:01,490 --> 02:18:02,590
I feel like...

3319
02:18:02,590 --> 02:18:05,350
If we had a zombie apocalypse now...

3320
02:18:05,350 --> 02:18:07,350
In the current day...

3321
02:18:07,350 --> 02:18:10,050
There's going to be YouTube tutorials of people like...

3322
02:18:10,050 --> 02:18:13,550
Giving like YouTube tutorials on like how to survive zombie apocalypse.

3323
02:18:14,170 --> 02:18:16,390
Assuming that the internet still works.

3324
02:18:20,930 --> 02:18:29,770
I'm just thinking, you know, like the YouTube headquarters with all the servers, with all the internet servers and stuff for YouTube.

3325
02:18:29,970 --> 02:18:31,750
Like, what are the zombies gonna do?

3326
02:18:32,150 --> 02:18:33,810
They're not gonna destroy the servers.

3327
02:18:33,950 --> 02:18:34,870
They're fucking brainless.

3328
02:18:34,910 --> 02:18:36,970
All they wanna do is just eat other people.

3329
02:18:37,370 --> 02:18:39,550
So, like, the servers are gonna be safe.

3330
02:18:39,730 --> 02:18:41,750
It just needs to be powered up, you know?

3331
02:18:42,130 --> 02:18:45,770
Like, the YouTube servers and, like, you know, we already have the experience.

3332
02:18:45,770 --> 02:18:47,470
We have the experience with, like, the pandemic.

3333
02:18:47,690 --> 02:18:49,070
So, we can work at home.

3334
02:18:49,210 --> 02:18:53,070
We don't have to be at the office to work on the YouTube servers.

3335
02:18:53,370 --> 02:18:54,590
So, then we can...

3336
02:18:55,290 --> 02:18:56,570
How would they destroy electricity?

3337
02:18:56,930 --> 02:19:00,730
They don't have fucking any neural neuron, like...

3338
02:19:02,350 --> 02:19:06,030
Neurological, like, craving to destroy the electricity.

3339
02:19:06,830 --> 02:19:08,510
Who's maintaining the power grid?

3340
02:19:08,670 --> 02:19:09,050
I don't know.

3341
02:19:09,050 --> 02:19:11,110
Just build a fucking fort around the power grid.

3342
02:19:11,290 --> 02:19:14,770
I feel like you can be, like, really rich in supplies if you're...

3343
02:19:16,290 --> 02:19:18,370
People who can't live without the internet...

3344
02:19:19,820 --> 02:19:24,250
Will give so much supplies to the person who runs the power grid.

3345
02:19:24,970 --> 02:19:25,510
Like...

3346
02:19:30,190 --> 02:19:32,210
They'll be like, here is my...

3347
02:19:32,210 --> 02:19:33,430
They'll be, like, treated like gods.

3348
02:19:33,550 --> 02:19:34,790
It's like, what's it called?

3349
02:19:34,950 --> 02:19:35,950
What's that movie called?

3350
02:19:36,230 --> 02:19:37,050
Mad Max?

3351
02:19:37,350 --> 02:19:39,990
It's like that guy that owned the water tower.

3352
02:19:42,310 --> 02:19:45,070
The person who owns the internet...

3353
02:19:45,070 --> 02:19:46,950
Will be treated like a god.

3354
02:19:47,130 --> 02:19:48,310
Just like that guy.

3355
02:19:49,470 --> 02:19:55,030
HAHAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHA Yeah, yeah.

3356
02:19:55,330 --> 02:19:56,610
Internet Joe.

3357
02:19:58,390 --> 02:20:00,170
HAHAHAHAHAHA They'll be like...

3358
02:20:00,850 --> 02:20:02,590
Internet Joe, please.

3359
02:20:02,730 --> 02:20:04,290
I need my content.

3360
02:20:04,690 --> 02:20:06,390
Can you... Here's my...

3361
02:20:07,070 --> 02:20:08,670
Here's my food supply.

3362
02:20:09,190 --> 02:20:11,410
For the next two weeks.

3363
02:20:11,770 --> 02:20:14,550
If you keep the internet alive.

3364
02:20:14,690 --> 02:20:15,050
If you keep the internet alive.

3365
02:20:15,070 --> 02:20:16,890
I don't know how to make...

3366
02:20:16,890 --> 02:20:18,790
I don't know how to make a...

3367
02:20:18,790 --> 02:20:20,970
I don't know how to make a desk.

3368
02:20:21,350 --> 02:20:23,150
We need desks in our...

3369
02:20:23,150 --> 02:20:24,090
In our bunker.

3370
02:20:24,210 --> 02:20:25,430
And we don't know...

3371
02:20:25,430 --> 02:20:29,530
And we need the YouTube video tutorial on how to make a desk.

3372
02:20:29,830 --> 02:20:31,490
Please, Internet Joe.

3373
02:20:31,850 --> 02:20:32,450

3374
02:20:33,750 --> 02:20:40,310
HAHAHAHAHAHA You shall reach YouTube Chrome and shine.

3375
02:20:42,950 --> 02:20:44,130
HAHAHAHAHAHA Okay.

3376
02:20:44,130 --> 02:20:44,450
Okay.

3377
02:20:44,990 --> 02:20:46,190
I stream.

3378
02:20:46,370 --> 02:20:47,270
I die.

3379
02:20:47,370 --> 02:20:48,830
I stream again.

3380
02:20:49,150 --> 02:20:49,950
Exactly!

3381
02:20:51,010 --> 02:20:51,810
Guys, look.

3382
02:20:51,870 --> 02:20:53,590
We need our YouTube tutorials chat.

3383
02:20:53,950 --> 02:20:54,750

3384
02:20:54,750 --> 02:20:56,410

Um...

3389
02:21:00,930 --> 02:21:01,890
Fiber.

3390
02:21:01,930 --> 02:21:03,370
We cannot...

3391
02:21:03,370 --> 02:21:05,070
We cannot live...

3392
02:21:05,070 --> 02:21:05,470

3393
02:21:05,650 --> 02:21:07,270

HAHAHAHA 10...

3395

10 upload speed.

3396
02:21:10,510 --> 02:21:12,050
Please help us.

3397
02:21:12,090 --> 02:21:13,970
Give us at least 50...

3398
02:21:13,970 --> 02:21:14,110
50...

3399
02:21:14,130 --> 02:21:16,110
50 uploads and download speed.

3400
02:21:16,330 --> 02:21:18,210
Please, Internet Joe.

3401
02:21:20,790 --> 02:21:21,430
HAHAHAHAHAHA

3402
02:21:25,670 --> 02:21:26,510
Let's see.

3403
02:21:26,850 --> 02:21:27,050
Um...

3404
02:21:27,050 --> 02:21:29,210
Mr. Moose, thank you for the super chat.

3405
02:21:29,330 --> 02:21:29,670
Thank you.

3406
02:21:29,710 --> 02:21:30,350
Thank you.

3407
02:21:30,750 --> 02:21:31,730
Zombie apocalypse.

3408
02:21:32,110 --> 02:21:37,850
I guarantee the IRS has a contingency plan for collecting taxes during a zombie apocalypse.

3409
02:21:38,830 --> 02:21:39,450
I...

3410
02:21:39,450 --> 02:21:40,530
Joe, please.

3411
02:21:40,590 --> 02:21:42,390
I can never go back to 10.

3412
02:21:42,530 --> 02:21:43,010
Joe.

3413
02:21:48,500 --> 02:21:48,980
Hmm...

3414
02:21:48,980 --> 02:21:49,500
Ok...

3415
02:21:49,500 --> 02:21:49,840
Oh, guys.

3416
02:21:49,860 --> 02:21:50,340
Varsan!

3417
02:21:50,440 --> 02:21:51,480
Thank you for the super chat.

3418
02:21:51,560 --> 02:21:51,900
Thank you.

3419
02:21:51,920 --> 02:21:52,480
Thank you!

3420
02:21:52,540 --> 02:21:54,020
You all saw the Hell divers...

3421
02:21:54,020 --> 02:21:55,420
Look, the robots are really scary...

3422
02:21:55,420 --> 02:21:57,460
The robots were really fucking scary...

3423
02:21:57,460 --> 02:21:58,940
I am going to go with zombie apocalypse.

3424
02:22:00,780 --> 02:22:01,660
All right...

3425
02:22:01,660 --> 02:22:02,480
Nice.

3426
02:22:03,060 --> 02:22:03,540
Nice.

3427
02:22:07,100 --> 02:22:07,720
All right.

3428
02:22:07,960 --> 02:22:08,440
Act...

3429
02:22:08,440 --> 02:22:09,540
This is stupid.

3430
02:22:09,860 --> 02:22:11,360
I am going to go with movies and TVs.

3431
02:22:11,600 --> 02:22:12,680
This is too much work.

3432
02:22:12,920 --> 02:22:14,820
Broadway is way too much work.

3433
02:22:15,020 --> 02:22:15,860
Like, this...

3434
02:22:15,860 --> 02:22:16,620
Filmed...

3435
02:22:16,620 --> 02:22:16,960
Done.

3436
02:22:16,960 --> 02:22:18,000
This is too much.

3437
02:22:19,540 --> 02:22:22,960
Also, you don't... you're not really famous when you're a Broadway star.

3438
02:22:25,460 --> 02:22:26,660
Always be lonely?

3439
02:22:27,140 --> 02:22:28,200
This is so sad.

3440
02:22:28,980 --> 02:22:30,500
Bro, this is too much.

3441
02:22:30,500 --> 02:22:32,560
But this is also so sad.

3442
02:22:33,120 --> 02:22:35,360
This is... bro, I don't wanna answer this.

3443
02:22:37,800 --> 02:22:41,800
As an introvert, this is way too much as an introvert.

3444
02:22:43,680 --> 02:22:45,740
But this is way too little.

3445
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:48,720
I'm not gonna debate about this.

3446
02:22:48,820 --> 02:22:50,560
I'm gonna stay surrounded by others.

3447
02:22:50,880 --> 02:22:52,760
Cause then I can always have collabs.

3448
02:22:55,080 --> 02:22:58,060
Doki, stop thinking about the content!

3449
02:22:58,580 --> 02:23:01,620
But then like, I can always have like, collabs if I want.

3450
02:23:01,740 --> 02:23:03,480
It'll be easier to afford to get collabs.

3451
02:23:03,800 --> 02:23:04,240
Alright.

3452
02:23:06,280 --> 02:23:06,720
Okay.

3453
02:23:07,860 --> 02:23:10,300
Alright, I'm gonna do like two more questions.

3454
02:23:10,520 --> 02:23:11,780
Chat, I'm gonna do two more than one.

3455
02:23:11,800 --> 02:23:12,320
We'll call it here.

3456
02:23:12,580 --> 02:23:14,340
The streamer mindset.

3457
02:23:15,260 --> 02:23:15,780
Alright.

3458
02:23:16,300 --> 02:23:20,240
Video game versus movie.

3459
02:23:21,340 --> 02:23:21,860
Alright.

3460
02:23:22,940 --> 02:23:25,880
Video game... movie.

3461
02:23:26,300 --> 02:23:27,740
I say video game?

3462
02:23:28,080 --> 02:23:30,060
Okay, it depends if I'm the main character.

3463
02:23:30,400 --> 02:23:32,180
Because I can have respawn.

3464
02:23:32,800 --> 02:23:34,060
I can respawn.

3465
02:23:35,040 --> 02:23:38,160
And the favorite... I feel like... I feel like video game.

3466
02:23:38,320 --> 02:23:40,480
It depends on what video game it is, so...

3467
02:23:40,480 --> 02:23:42,920
It depends on what video game.

3468
02:23:43,060 --> 02:23:48,440
But I feel like if I was in my favorite video game, I can always respawn.

3469
02:23:49,980 --> 02:23:52,540
Oh wait, my favorite is like Professor Layden.

3470
02:23:52,640 --> 02:23:53,440
So like, I'm fine.

3471
02:23:53,920 --> 02:23:55,120
I can be Luke!

3472
02:23:55,720 --> 02:23:56,840
Luke, my boy!

3473
02:23:57,180 --> 02:23:57,500
Professor!

3474
02:23:58,060 --> 02:23:59,140
Yeah, I'm gonna do...

3475
02:23:59,140 --> 02:24:00,620
My favorite movie?

3476
02:24:00,840 --> 02:24:02,640
I don't even know what my favorite movie is.

3477
02:24:03,380 --> 02:24:03,860
Professor!

3478
02:24:05,120 --> 02:24:05,600
Professor!

3479
02:24:08,760 --> 02:24:09,240
Professor!

3480
02:24:09,920 --> 02:24:10,300
Professor!

3481
02:24:10,300 --> 02:24:11,940
Alright, I'll say video game.

3482
02:24:12,020 --> 02:24:14,240
I don't even know... I don't think I have a favorite movie.

3483
02:24:14,720 --> 02:24:15,780
I don't think so.

3484
02:24:15,940 --> 02:24:17,820
So I'm gonna go with video game.

3485
02:24:18,060 --> 02:24:19,140
This is not really a debate.

3486
02:24:19,280 --> 02:24:19,540
What?

3487
02:24:19,760 --> 02:24:21,180
I guess... normies.

3488
02:24:21,280 --> 02:24:22,060
Fucking normies.

3489
02:24:22,500 --> 02:24:22,940
Hahahaha!

3490
02:24:24,500 --> 02:24:24,940
Hahahaha!

3491
02:24:25,680 --> 02:24:26,720
Alright, I'm refreshing.

3492
02:24:26,920 --> 02:24:27,700
This question sucks.

3493
02:24:27,900 --> 02:24:29,660
This is not gonna be my last question.

3494
02:24:30,040 --> 02:24:31,200
I'm refreshing this.

3495
02:24:31,700 --> 02:24:33,580
This is a bad would you rather.

3496
02:24:33,920 --> 02:24:34,340
Alright.

3497
02:24:36,460 --> 02:24:36,900
Uh...

3498
02:24:36,900 --> 02:24:38,200
I'm gonna try and get a good one.

3499
02:24:40,160 --> 02:24:40,460
Uhhhh...

3500
02:24:40,980 --> 02:24:41,780
Let's see.

3501
02:24:42,980 --> 02:24:44,480
Oh my god!

3502
02:24:44,520 --> 02:24:45,420
This was terrible!

3503
02:24:50,860 --> 02:24:51,460
Okay.

3504
02:24:51,740 --> 02:24:52,280
Alright.

3505
02:24:52,580 --> 02:24:53,500
Okay, I'm gonna...

3506
02:24:54,020 --> 02:24:55,000
That's not gonna be my...

3507
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:55,480
Hahaha!

3508
02:24:55,580 --> 02:24:56,520
I can't get it!

3509
02:24:56,780 --> 02:24:57,380
Hahaha!

3510
02:24:59,340 --> 02:25:01,260
We're ending it with this.

3511
02:25:01,480 --> 02:25:03,000
This is like debate club.

3512
02:25:04,080 --> 02:25:07,020
We're gonna end it with this one.

3513
02:25:08,460 --> 02:25:09,140
Hahaha!

3514
02:25:10,340 --> 02:25:10,600
Hahaha!

3515
02:25:12,980 --> 02:25:14,640
Oh my god!

3516
02:25:14,900 --> 02:25:18,060
We're gonna end it with this one.

3517
02:25:19,020 --> 02:25:19,700
Alright.

3518
02:25:20,660 --> 02:25:21,340
Alright.

3519
02:25:22,760 --> 02:25:23,440
Okay.

3520
02:25:24,100 --> 02:25:26,220
This is so easy for me.

3521
02:25:26,440 --> 02:25:27,020
But...

3522
02:25:27,020 --> 02:25:31,500
No matter what choice we make, we're all horrible people.

3523
02:25:31,700 --> 02:25:32,720
Cause like...

3524
02:25:32,720 --> 02:25:33,440
Hahaha!

3525
02:25:34,880 --> 02:25:36,760
Cause like a lot of people are like, cancer!

3526
02:25:36,980 --> 02:25:38,180
But then someone's like, bro, where did you get cancer?

3527
02:25:38,180 --> 02:25:39,480
World hunger kills more people.

3528
02:25:39,880 --> 02:25:40,840
But like...

3529
02:25:40,840 --> 02:25:41,620
But...

3530
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:42,320
Okay!

3531
02:25:42,540 --> 02:25:43,340
But cancer!

3532
02:25:43,660 --> 02:25:45,240
But if we cure cancer!

3533
02:25:45,660 --> 02:25:49,340
My mom can't be like, this food can cause cancer anymore.

3534
02:25:49,720 --> 02:25:50,300
She can't...

3535
02:25:50,300 --> 02:25:54,940
My parents can't lie and be like, don't do this, it'll cause cancer.

3536
02:25:55,060 --> 02:25:56,940
Don't do that, it'll cause cancer.

3537
02:25:57,060 --> 02:26:00,680
If I cure cancer, that won't be an excuse anymore!

3538
02:26:01,200 --> 02:26:01,680
Hahaha!

3539
02:26:02,120 --> 02:26:02,660
Hahaha!

3540
02:26:02,660 --> 02:26:03,040
Hahaha!

3541
02:26:04,160 --> 02:26:04,800
Hahaha!

3542
02:26:05,100 --> 02:26:08,040
Cause someone's like, I'd rather save kids than adults.

3543
02:26:08,600 --> 02:26:10,460
Cancer patients get hungry too.

3544
02:26:10,560 --> 02:26:12,820
Well, they're already suffering through many things!

3545
02:26:13,080 --> 02:26:14,600
At least we'll get rid of one...

3546
02:26:14,600 --> 02:26:16,120
Okay, if we starve...

3547
02:26:16,120 --> 02:26:17,080
You can't say...

3548
02:26:17,080 --> 02:26:20,520
Cancer patients are already starving too.

3549
02:26:20,740 --> 02:26:22,980
Because they'll die from one or the other.

3550
02:26:23,600 --> 02:26:24,160
Like...

3551
02:26:24,160 --> 02:26:26,360
We say, cure world hunger.

3552
02:26:26,700 --> 02:26:29,600
But they're still gonna fucking suffer from cancer!

3553
02:26:30,440 --> 02:26:33,160
Like, what kind of fucking question is that?

3554
02:26:33,440 --> 02:26:35,080
What kind of fucking answer is that?

3555
02:26:35,100 --> 02:26:38,520
Eventually, we will solve...

3556
02:26:38,520 --> 02:26:42,260
Look, you don't cure world hunger.

3557
02:26:42,720 --> 02:26:43,680
You just...

3558
02:26:43,680 --> 02:26:46,180
You don't cure world hunger.

3559
02:26:46,500 --> 02:26:47,860
It's just that...

3560
02:26:48,920 --> 02:26:51,300
It's just that we don't provide...

3561
02:26:51,300 --> 02:26:51,980
We don't have...

3562
02:26:51,980 --> 02:26:54,780
Like, we don't provide food to like...

3563
02:26:54,780 --> 02:26:58,640
Like, we are not good at providing food to people, apparently.

3564
02:26:58,900 --> 02:26:59,380
Hahaha!

3565
02:26:59,880 --> 02:27:02,620
Cause there's already a cure to world hunger!

3566
02:27:02,840 --> 02:27:04,580
And it's just food!

3567
02:27:04,660 --> 02:27:05,080
Yeah!

3568
02:27:05,100 --> 02:27:07,680
It's literally just food!

3569
02:27:08,260 --> 02:27:09,300
There's no cure!

3570
02:27:09,560 --> 02:27:10,660
We have the cure!

3571
02:27:10,840 --> 02:27:12,800
We're just not applying the cure!

3572
02:27:13,320 --> 02:27:13,540
Hahaha!

3573
02:27:14,660 --> 02:27:15,180
Um...

3574
02:27:15,740 --> 02:27:16,260
Charles...

3575
02:27:16,260 --> 02:27:17,500
Thank you for the super chat.

3576
02:27:17,560 --> 02:27:18,180
Thank you, thank you.

3577
02:27:18,220 --> 02:27:19,180
Cancer is harder.

3578
02:27:19,480 --> 02:27:20,820
World hunger is more of a dis...

3579
02:27:20,820 --> 02:27:21,340
Yeah, exactly!

3580
02:27:21,600 --> 02:27:23,580
It's a distribution issue!

3581
02:27:24,100 --> 02:27:25,620
We have the cure!

3582
02:27:25,900 --> 02:27:27,360
And it's just food!

3583
02:27:27,600 --> 02:27:30,100
But we don't provide the food!

3584
02:27:30,340 --> 02:27:31,320
We don't provide...

3585
02:27:31,320 --> 02:27:32,960
We don't distribute the food!

3586
02:27:33,160 --> 02:27:34,760
We don't know what the cure is!

3587
02:27:34,760 --> 02:27:35,520
We don't have the evidence for cancer yet!

3588
02:27:35,640 --> 02:27:36,480
I'm so right.

3589
02:27:36,720 --> 02:27:41,120
We're always being like, we are in a new breakthrough regarding the cure for cancer.

3590
02:27:41,380 --> 02:27:44,240
But we still haven't fucking cured cancer yet.

3591
02:27:45,280 --> 02:27:46,000
Um...

3592
02:27:46,620 --> 02:27:51,460
World hunger gone, equals lesser crime, equals lesser death.

3593
02:27:52,480 --> 02:27:54,660
But cancer is terrible!

3594
02:27:56,420 --> 02:27:57,140
Okay.

3595
02:27:57,320 --> 02:27:57,900
Anyway.

3596
02:27:58,260 --> 02:27:58,760
Hahaha!

3597
02:27:58,760 --> 02:28:00,760
Meanwhile, us wasting...

3598
02:28:00,760 --> 02:28:01,160
Okay!

3599
02:28:01,160 --> 02:28:06,300
Okay, I feel like some of that part is so fucked up, but like there's literally nothing we can do about it.

3600
02:28:06,340 --> 02:28:17,840
The wasting food part, because it's like there's a lot of like supermarkets and a lot of bakeries and a lot of like food making places.

3601
02:28:18,040 --> 02:28:23,480
Where if there's like an excess amount of food, they don't donate the food, they just throw it out.

3602
02:28:23,760 --> 02:28:25,700
Because it's a legal issue.

3603
02:28:25,700 --> 02:28:33,240
Because what if somebody gets sick off of the food you donated, they have the legal means to sue you.

3604
02:28:33,440 --> 02:28:37,280
And like in America, everybody loves to sue people.

3605
02:28:37,480 --> 02:28:39,800
Like everyone loves to pursue lawsuits.

3606
02:28:40,060 --> 02:28:45,940
So people don't... they are like we have to throw it away because they don't want to be liable to...

3607
02:28:45,940 --> 02:28:48,680
They don't want to be liable to be...

3608
02:28:52,160 --> 02:28:55,180
They don't want to be liable for it too.

3609
02:28:55,720 --> 02:28:57,420
I know that's like one of the reasons.

3610
02:28:57,520 --> 02:29:00,940
I don't know what the other reasons were as to why they don't donate the food.

3611
02:29:04,500 --> 02:29:09,840
But I don't remember why... there was like another reason why they don't donate the food.

3612
02:29:10,100 --> 02:29:16,180
But it's like this is like one of the main reasons because they don't want to be liable for a lawsuit if somebody gets sick off of the food you donated.

3613
02:29:22,660 --> 02:29:25,680
If you give it to a food bank, then you waive all the...

3614
02:29:25,700 --> 02:29:26,080
liability.

3615
02:29:26,460 --> 02:29:27,280
That's a myth?

3616
02:29:27,980 --> 02:29:29,100
Oh my god!

3617
02:29:29,260 --> 02:29:31,480
I believed that for so long!

3618
02:29:31,900 --> 02:29:35,180
It's like the whole McDonald's thing all over again.

3619
02:29:36,160 --> 02:29:37,840
They can write off the losses.

3620
02:29:38,020 --> 02:29:39,500
Oh, it's all about taxes, man.

3621
02:29:39,580 --> 02:29:40,340
It's always...

3622
02:29:40,680 --> 02:29:43,240
Why does this always come back to taxes?

3623
02:29:43,620 --> 02:29:52,840
Why does this always come back to taxes, man?

3624
02:29:57,940 --> 02:30:01,920
It's just like the McDonald's coffee thing all over again.

3625
02:30:02,080 --> 02:30:05,700
Where they fucking tell you that was true and then you finalist.

3626
02:30:05,760 --> 02:30:06,960
Did you guys know?

3627
02:30:07,620 --> 02:30:09,160
Super Size Me?

3628
02:30:09,640 --> 02:30:14,460
Apparently, we were lied to about the movie Super Size Me.

3629
02:30:14,680 --> 02:30:25,680
Because apparently, the guy who made that movie, who made Super Size Me, embellished it so much that like apparently, like, a lot of the people who made it, they were like, oh, this is so good.

3630
02:30:25,680 --> 02:30:28,760
But the movies from Super Size Me is a fucking lie.

3631
02:30:29,020 --> 02:30:33,080
I watched that movie in class at least four times.

3632
02:30:34,160 --> 02:30:35,080
It was terrible.

3633
02:30:35,080 --> 02:30:42,720
I fucking watched Super Size Me at least three to four times because our teachers were always like, let's watch something educational.

3634
02:30:43,020 --> 02:30:47,200
Super Size Me regarding like the health and the fast food industry.

3635
02:30:47,620 --> 02:30:55,020
What Super Size Me is about some dude that fucking binged himself with McDonald's and got like incredibly unhealthy.

3636
02:30:55,080 --> 02:30:55,660
Yeah.

3637
02:30:55,680 --> 02:30:57,140
His wife divorced him after.

3638
02:30:57,640 --> 02:31:08,180
I shouldn't laugh about this, but like it's because I don't know if it's his wife or his girlfriend, but like his girlfriend's vegan.

3639
02:31:14,260 --> 02:31:25,300
It's either like his girlfriend or his wife, but like his girlfriend or wife like left him because like she's vegan and then she could never stop eating.

3640
02:31:25,300 --> 02:31:29,500
And he was also like vegetarian slash vegan.

3641
02:31:29,720 --> 02:31:30,520
I don't remember which one.

3642
02:31:30,640 --> 02:31:34,080
He was apparently like vegan slash vegetarian.

3643
02:31:34,560 --> 02:31:38,440
And he did the whole Super Size Me stuff.

3644
02:31:41,250 --> 02:31:44,780
And and then like and then like he couldn't go back.

3645
02:31:44,960 --> 02:31:46,940
He couldn't stop eating meat.

3646
02:31:47,080 --> 02:31:49,140
Like he couldn't stop.

3647
02:31:51,200 --> 02:31:54,620
And then also like he was complaining.

3648
02:31:55,300 --> 02:31:56,580
About like the health issues.

3649
02:31:56,880 --> 02:32:05,140
But also he was a full on vegan and you cannot go straight into fast food after being vegan for so long.

3650
02:32:05,500 --> 02:32:11,120
Like your body is not fucking your body cannot handle that.

3651
02:32:11,240 --> 02:32:16,140
If you used to be vegan and you suddenly decided to just eat fast food.

3652
02:32:16,380 --> 02:32:17,060
Like.

3653
02:32:23,160 --> 02:32:25,180
There's like shit like that.

3654
02:32:25,180 --> 02:32:28,840
Anyway, Super Size Me was apparently a fucking lie.

3655
02:32:29,140 --> 02:32:33,700
I couldn't believe it when I when I found out it like broke my world.

3656
02:32:33,920 --> 02:32:48,120
It actually like ruined reality for me because I I was like I saw that movie so many times at school and then people were like, by the way, Super Size Me was so embellished.

3657
02:32:48,660 --> 02:32:48,980
Hey.

3658
02:32:49,440 --> 02:32:49,480
Hey.

3659
02:32:49,480 --> 02:32:49,940
Hey.

3660
02:32:56,600 --> 02:33:00,180
Anyway, anyway, anyway, a super size though.

3661
02:33:00,340 --> 02:33:10,660
I think the super size though, like for those who didn't know McDonald's used to used to like have a size called Super Size and it was like fucking crazy.

3662
02:33:11,580 --> 02:33:17,040
I still I do think the super size size amount is insane.

3663
02:33:18,440 --> 02:33:23,000
So like I would give them that like I would fucking give them that regarding super size.

3664
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:23,380
Like.

3665
02:33:26,400 --> 02:33:29,560
And an American portion is so funny.

3666
02:33:29,640 --> 02:33:41,620
I was watching a short about like fast food portions and it was like it was like like here are American fast food portions versus like Asia fast food portions.

3667
02:33:41,800 --> 02:33:43,400
And I'm like, Jesus fucking Christ.

3668
02:33:46,120 --> 02:33:52,980
Like I think it was like Japan large was like an American like medium or something.

3669
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:54,960
And I was like, Jesus fucking Christ.

3670
02:33:59,560 --> 02:34:02,180
I'm just like, bro, what the fuck, bro?

3671
02:34:05,700 --> 02:34:08,620
Like the soda cups are just crazy.

3672
02:34:08,880 --> 02:34:11,100
And anyway, I cure cancer.

3673
02:34:12,040 --> 02:34:13,480
It's a rough decision.

3674
02:34:15,400 --> 02:34:20,960
I think I think this is like a good a good place to end it.

3675
02:34:21,120 --> 02:34:21,720
Cancer.

3676
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:23,180
The world.

3677
02:34:23,300 --> 02:34:28,540
The fucking hardest, hardest talk we had to have.

3678
02:34:28,860 --> 02:34:31,620
I like how I like how ended it with that.

3679
02:34:37,630 --> 02:34:39,330
Oh, my God.

3680
02:34:39,710 --> 02:34:41,190
It was we did it.

3681
02:34:41,250 --> 02:34:42,390
We cured cancer.

3682
02:34:42,750 --> 02:34:43,310
Dragoons.

3683
02:34:43,430 --> 02:34:45,150
We figured it out.

3684
02:34:46,430 --> 02:34:54,530
Anyway, guys, OK, anyway, as I had a great time just hanging out with all of you.

3685
02:34:54,530 --> 02:34:59,350
It was I had a fun time debating and hanging out with all of you guys today.

3686
02:34:59,430 --> 02:35:00,150
It was very fun.

3687
02:35:00,370 --> 02:35:01,230
It was really enjoyable.

3688
02:35:01,570 --> 02:35:06,610
I knew we could do it no matter what.

3689
02:35:06,710 --> 02:35:11,410
We can be both terrible and good people as well because we cured one thing.

3690
02:35:12,550 --> 02:35:13,830
Anyway, that was wild.

3691
02:35:14,030 --> 02:35:16,590
We had a wild time today chat.

3692
02:35:18,310 --> 02:35:29,710
But I honestly always enjoy streaming for you guys, and I always enjoy like having these random fucking discussions with both with both of you, with all two of you, Dragoons.

3693
02:35:30,210 --> 02:35:33,670
One will debate about the other and then one will debate about that.

3694
02:35:33,810 --> 02:35:36,570
With both two of you, Dragoons.

3695
02:35:36,590 --> 02:35:37,650
It was so fun.

3696
02:35:40,370 --> 02:35:41,690
One of them is you.

3697
02:35:42,050 --> 02:35:42,730
That's you.

3698
02:35:42,890 --> 02:35:43,330
That's right.

3699
02:35:43,370 --> 02:35:44,450
I'm talking about you.

3700
02:35:45,670 --> 02:35:46,390
That's right.

3701
02:35:46,490 --> 02:35:46,710
You.

3702
02:35:46,850 --> 02:35:47,610
She's talking about me.

3703
02:35:47,670 --> 02:35:47,970
Yes.

3704
02:35:48,070 --> 02:35:48,550
You.

3705
02:35:49,030 --> 02:35:51,650
We're both two Dragoons.

3706
02:35:53,310 --> 02:35:53,750
Anyway.

3707
02:35:54,850 --> 02:35:56,050
I'm going to call it here, everybody.

3708
02:35:56,190 --> 02:35:57,950
I hope you guys had fun hanging out with me today.

3709
02:35:58,330 --> 02:36:00,710
As always, everyone stay hydrated.

3710
02:36:01,410 --> 02:36:02,090
Posture check.

3711
02:36:02,210 --> 02:36:04,770
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3712
02:36:04,990 --> 02:36:08,770
And if you stay up for me, head to bed because you deserve it.

3713
02:36:08,910 --> 02:36:10,270
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

3714
02:36:10,890 --> 02:36:11,730
Bye, guys.

3715
02:36:12,650 --> 02:36:13,090
Bye.
