1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,020
We don't have Lili.

2
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:03,500
Code's in the channel chat.

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:09,420
Yeah, I can add you in it if you need.

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,280
I just did that.

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,220
I pinged you in it, Lili.

6
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:14,480
Yeah.

7
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:19,930
Wait, can I rejoin?

8
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:21,170
Yeah, you can.

9
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,070
You should be able to.

10
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,230
Hey, Lili, scroll up.

11
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,190
As long as you don't leak the code.

12
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:28,650
Scroll up to the G1 Lobby B.

13
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:30,190
That channel.

14
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:31,090
That'll have the...

15
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:31,770
Okay, you know what?

16
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:32,910
I'll just message it to you.

17
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,010
That should be easier, maybe.

18
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,320
I feel so at peace right now.

19
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,320
Wait, Lili's not...

20
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,440
Is Lili in the Discord?

21
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,420
Did she leave?

22
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:50,360
Lili left the call.

23
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,440
Yeah, Lili left the call.

24
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:51,900
Yeah.

25
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:52,540
Yeah, where the hell is she now?

26
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,240
Lili left entirely.

27
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,180
Why is there two Dawkins?

28
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,880
Yeah, but I had to, like, relock.

29
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,720
They need to kick me.

30
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,580
Oh, I see.

31
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,560
Oh, Lili crashed.

32
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:06,260
Oh.

33
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,540
I don't think they can kick you, right?

34
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:10,740
Like, you have to leave yourself.

35
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,480
Yeah, but I did.

36
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,420
Yeah, but I did.

37
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,660
Didn't you just close the browser?

38
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,560
Well, I did, and then...

39
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,160
That's weird.

40
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:19,740
Never assumed it.

41
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,800
Well, you might have to remake, then.

42
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,880
Thank God, like, these games always have an intro, because I've never played this one before.

43
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,280
Right?

44
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,440
Wait, when I played it, it was, like...

45
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,360
It was...

46
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,080
My Discord stream goes black.

47
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,680
I was like, wait, Jackbox is not just QuickFlash?

48
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:35,480
.

49
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:37,720
.

50
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,080
What's wrong, Jack?

51
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:44,620
Wait, whenever I tab out, like, of the Discord stream, like, on my stream, it's just black.

52
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,080
Yeah, so...

53
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:51,080
Uh, if there's another full-screen application covering it, it'll turn it black.

54
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:51,660
Oh.

55
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,440
As to take priority.

56
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,680
I have a hardware acceleration.

57
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,280
Nobody say anything.

58
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,520
Oh.

59
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:01,620
Oh.

60
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,940
I guess because, like, it's all anonymous, so you don't...

61
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,200
You can't, like, vote for each...

62
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,200
Whoa, whoa, what's that?

63
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:08,900
Whoa.

64
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,620
Oh, it's because they're making a new lobby.

65
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:11,820
Oh.

66
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,320
Hide this screen, everyone.

67
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,520
Hey, wait, remove...

68
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,040
Don't hide...

69
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,420
Hide this screen?

70
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,320
I think so.

71
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,280
Yeah, hide it so they don't see the code.

72
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,200
Oh, they just ended the stream.

73
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,460
Oh, okay.

74
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:26,860
Peace out.

75
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,180
Good call.

76
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:28,700
Welcome back, really.

77
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,680
This is going really well.

78
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,020
We love it.

79
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,460
At least we're here as a team.

80
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,400
That's the main thing.

81
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,020
We love it.

82
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:38,960
I've got some peppermint tea.

83
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:39,940
Oh.

84
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,320
Peppermint.

85
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:42,920
Ooh.

86
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,540
In a grommet mug.

87
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,680
All right, tournament's over.

88
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,520
Oh, new code.

89
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,120
New code.

90
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:51,640
There's a new room.

91
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,240
All right.

92
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,080
Can I just do it on my phone?

93
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,520
Yeah, you can.

94
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:57,880
You can.

95
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,820
But make sure to only join once.

96
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,480
Yes, ma'am.

97
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,540
Any more than that, and you're demoted.

98
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,320
Your team is completely just beyond.

99
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,700
Wait, who's on my team?

100
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:13,780
Kumi.

101
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:14,720
Doki.

102
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,560
True.

103
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,120
Tenzin.

104
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,260
I don't know.

105
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,220
What if, like...

106
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,700
You never told me who's on my team.

107
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,400
You're just...

108
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,100
You never asked.

109
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:22,620
You're like, you want to play.

110
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,080
Damn.

111
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,320
You never asked.

112
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,800
Because I need to know who I'm, like...

113
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,360
I need to know so I don't accidentally self-sabotage.

114
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:29,920
Damn.

115
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,480
Hurry up, demons.

116
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,280
Jack and Tenzin are on our team.

117
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:32,640
Mm.

118
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,680
The Kirby and the bear.

119
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,440
Okay.

120
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:35,620
Okay.

121
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,740
I will make sure I don't sabotage ourselves.

122
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,880
Streams back up, everyone.

123
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,240
You can screen share again.

124
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,120
Okay.

125
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:43,980
Perfect.

126
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,640
And we're all happy about this.

127
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,640
We should have a code word so we vote for our team's...

128
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,460
Okay.

129
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,120
I'm clearing this.

130
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,080
There you are.

131
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:56,800
Let's go to HR.

132
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,380
Welcome back, Lily.

133
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:01,780
Lily?

134
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:05,580
Oh, no.

135
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,340
Lily's not back yet.

136
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,160
Okay, good call.

137
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:08,560
I had comps.

138
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,920
Is she mad at us?

139
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,920
Definitely mad at you.

140
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,700
She's been talking so much shit about you, Gumi.

141
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,320
Oh, my God.

142
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,860
It's because I played Blanka.

143
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,280
Yeah, 100%.

144
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,080
Ew, you played Blanka?

145
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,840
Oh, these fars- I was going to play Juri, man.

146
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,080
I was going to play Juri, but then CJ was like, Blanka's just like Yoshimitsu.

147
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,080
Is it true, though?

148
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,460
Yeah, he has a lot of gimmicks.

149
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:33,980
It is funky.

150
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,140
Yeah, she has the Blanka ball.

151
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:35,420
Oh, she has the Blanka ball.

152
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,540
I just remember how Blanka sounds like Donkey Kong.

153
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:37,900
And when he parries, he shakes ass.

154
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,940
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

155
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,520
He goes, .

156
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,240
Just like that.

157
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,420
Wait, how did they- Wait, sorry, can you go again?

158
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:46,960
How did they go again?

159
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:47,740
One more time?

160
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:48,540
.

161
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,800
Sounds like a dog that's about to bark.

162
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,840
A very sad dog.

163
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:03,440
Oh, apparently, Gumi, you're the VIP, Gumi.

164
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,400
You controlled the game.

165
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,160
Yeah, you know what to do Gumi.

166
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:08,760
You know what to do.

167
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,420
Is everybody... who are you missing?

168
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,980
It's just Lily, but I think she's having...

169
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,180
No, we're missing two.

170
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,560
Oh nevermind, now we're just playing.

171
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:30,180
Well, I was looking at OBS and the thingy's blocking it.

172
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,740
All right, I think we're just waiting on Lily now, right?

173
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:34,660
Yeah.

174
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:36,820
Um...

175
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:38,620
Okay.

176
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:42,840
Okay.

177
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,280
Okay.

178
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,700
All right.

179
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:50,820
Okay.

180
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,240
Okay.

181
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:59,020
Lily asked for five minutes, so everyone let's do icebreakers.

182
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:00,580
Okay.

183
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,940
I would rather die.

184
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,440
I don't want to talk anymore.

185
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,540
What does that even mean?

186
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,820
Welcome back to high school.

187
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:08,420
Okay.

188
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,780
Icebreakers are when you introduce yourself and a fun fact about yourself.

189
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:16,260
Yeah, like why don't you do like a two truths and one lies, everybody?

190
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,480
Hold on, let me drink some vodka real quick.

191
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,060
I can do it then.

192
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,180
Oh, okay.

193
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:20,440
Okay.

194
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:20,640
Okay.

195
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,100
Oh, damn.

196
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,960
What the doki?

197
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:25,820
Simmer down.

198
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,620
Simmer down.

199
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,500
Slurp, slurp.

200
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,180
Oh wait, I need messaging.

201
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,000
Oh.

202
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,840
Where are you messaging?

203
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:54,760
wake up wake up wake up Wake up Wakey wakey Wait I'll just...

204
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,040
Ocean man

205
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,320
Man, sorry for bringing up icebreakers...

206
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,980
I didn't know what killed the mood.

207
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,420
I really killed it.

208
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,300
It's time to break the ice.

209
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,100
Well, you just started.

210
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,600
He just brought, like, trauma.

211
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,760
Made everybody remember how bad high school was.

212
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,400
Alright, I just took a shot.

213
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:29,600
I'm ready.

214
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,680
What's the icebreaker?

215
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,240
Okay, I muted myself, guys.

216
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,320
Basically, for those who don't know, I got invited last minute.

217
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:37,600
Last minute.

218
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,300
I got invited...

219
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:45,100
Last minute to Twitch Rivals, Jackbox.

220
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,160
How do you make Jackbox competitive?

221
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,640
I asked the same question!

222
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:54,420
But basically, you get points, and then...

223
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,600
My most embarrassing moment?

224
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:10,700
One time in fourth grade, I thought I was in Treasure Show and I brought a large alligator doll and I sat in front of the entire class and everyone was getting ready for reading time, so I just sat there like an idiot with an alligator doll and the teacher didn't even tell me.

225
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:15,860
He just sat there looking at me and I realized, oh, it's reading time, so I had to put my alligator doll away.

226
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,120
What do they mean?

227
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,620
That teacher fucking hates you.

228
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,740
Honestly, fuck that teacher.

229
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,640
Was everybody else really loud?

230
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,780
I don't know if Sound Guy's awake at this time.

231
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,020
This was a very last minute stream.

232
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,240
I could turn people down.

233
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,680
I need to save the setting, though.

234
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:32,460
Who's next?

235
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:36,360
I'm gonna save this setting so I'll remember it before you see Jam Slam.

236
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,340
I'll turn people down, though.

237
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,760
My name is Tenzin.

238
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:48,900
My most embarrassing moment was I was at the water park at a birthday party and my crush was there, so I was trying to look cool and it was the first time I ever wore a two-piece.

239
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:52,460
I was in middle school, by the way, so normally I wore a one-piece but I was like, you know what, I'm gonna be a little...

240
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,740
I wanted to be a grown-ass bitch.

241
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,480
So I wore a two-piece and then I went to go surfing on this thingy.

242
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,140
It was like the fake waves where you surf on.

243
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,380
So my crush was there in line and I was like, I'll show him something.

244
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,680
Wait, no, please, Peter, wait!

245
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,120
No, no, no!

246
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:20,920
And then I surfed and then I fell off the thingy and I fell like, backwards, so the wave was crashing into my pants and then my pants fell off and then I had to stand up and pull out my pants.

247
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,660
Oh no!

248
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,980
You couldn't pull underneath the water?

249
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,400
You had to stand up.

250
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,920
No, the water was so...

251
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,680
I couldn't.

252
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,400
I couldn't stand up because then I would get knocked off my feet because of the waves.

253
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,640
So I mooned everybody.

254
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:39,620
You think he remembers?

255
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,060
100% remembers.

256
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,720
It's like 10 years has passed and he's died.

257
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,180
I'm a girl that don't moon me.

258
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,540
You made his day, probably.

259
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,120
Yeah, maybe.

260
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,000
Amazing memory.

261
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,700
Whoa!

262
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:03,600
He's like, damn, I didn't think I'd wake up and see ass today.

263
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,920
I'm starting in 3, 2, 1, starting!

264
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,260
Are we all here?

265
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,160
Yeah, we're all here.

266
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,220
Literally, everybody's here.

267
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,040
Which one's me?

268
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,260
Peter, that looks like you.

269
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:16,900
Oh, that's me.

270
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,860
Oh shit!

271
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:19,800
Wait, fuck you.

272
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,520
My eyes aren't that big.

273
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,020
I'm a teenager.

274
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:21,820
Wait, I'm a parent?

275
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,020
Who's the parent?

276
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:24,960
I'm a parent.

277
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,720
I wanna be a teenager.

278
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,880
Wait, why does Doki look so fucking cool?

279
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,860
Wait, no!

280
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,780
I look stupid!

281
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,320
Oh, fuck.

282
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,560
You're like a fucking Pixar mom.

283
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,500
Real shit.

284
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,100
Alright, who also has no idea how to play this game?

285
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,360
All of us.

286
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,840
I don't think people realize this game existed.

287
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,420
Alright.

288
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,460
That's why we're here.

289
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,900
This game came out three years ago.

290
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,300
Aww, look at you.

291
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,280
We're cute together.

292
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,280
Wow.

293
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,720
Oh, I'm a fucking...

294
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,900
I'm a boomer, I think.

295
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:10,320
I'm an adult.

296
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,140
No, I think you're a child.

297
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:13,600
Am I?

298
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,960
Wait, are the teams mixed?

299
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:15,760
I'm so confused.

300
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,800
Yes, let's see the tutorial.

301
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,880
Please, we need it.

302
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:23,140
You're going to see a list of tasks appear on your device.

303
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,560
You know, mow the lawn, muck out the gutters, stand in the garage, and sigh.

304
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,320
These are normal chores humans do every day.

305
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,420
No one knows why.

306
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,800
Complete these tasks and you'll earn points for the family score.

307
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,920
Keeping the family score high is your number one priority.

308
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:44,960
If you end the week with a low family score, you'll get a failing grade, and the boss downstairs will not be happy with you.

309
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,040
Ah, Satan.

310
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:49,240
I suggest you work together to do as many tasks as possible.

311
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:53,600
Some tasks require teamwork, so don't be afraid to yell when you need a hand.

312
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,540
But, there's also a prize for the individual that earns the most points.

313
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:01,880
They'll be rewarded with a human-style trophy to lord over the rest of the family.

314
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,580
The coveted world's bestest devil mug.

315
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:08,840
Last thing, tasks with this symbol are selfish tasks.

316
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,840
They don't help the family at all.

317
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:15,400
And doing too many causes an emergency that can be catastrophic to the family score.

318
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:20,060
However, they're worth a ton of points to those devilish enough to get away with them.

319
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:20,820
Just saying.

320
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,180
Okay.

321
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,900
I didn't retain any of that.

322
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:31,580
But like, what if I'm on the - but what if I'm on the enemy's family team?

323
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:35,740
Gronking?

324
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,000
I can't tell if we're all on the same team.

325
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,360
I think we're all on the same team.

326
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,400
Is this like, gooning?

327
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,200
What?

328
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:44,480
Huh?

329
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,640
That actually says this.

330
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,700
We're gonna find out soon.

331
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,580
I'm so confused.

332
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,120
What is this?

333
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,080
And doing all of them is the only way to get a perfect grade.

334
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,620
So don't screw them up.

335
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,140
Wait, what did they say?

336
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,340
In the minigame.

337
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:01,460
Oh.

338
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,720
Uh, shit.

339
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,460
Give me rice!

340
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,120
What do you need?

341
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:07,840
You need rice?

342
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,540
From the pantry.

343
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,200
Rice from the pantry.

344
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,020
Okay, I got it.

345
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:11,460
I got it.

346
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:11,700
Okay.

347
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,100
From the spice rack.

348
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,180
Soy beans from the pantry.

349
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,060
Eggs from the fridge.

350
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,040
Soy sauce from the spice rack.

351
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,140
So grab them quick.

352
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,200
Do you want it in the spice rack?

353
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,040
What is the spice rack?

354
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,720
What do you need in the spice rack?

355
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:31,020
I'm at the pantry.

356
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,040
What do I need at the pantry?

357
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,400
Sesame oil and nori.

358
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,200
Sesame oil and nori.

359
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:37,700
Okay, I got it.

360
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:38,020
Nori.

361
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,800
And I need eggs from the fridge.

362
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,140
I got the items.

363
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:43,560
Okay, I got it.

364
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,700
Okay, we gotta watch about gronking.

365
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:47,920
Uh...

366
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,180
Looks like someone's being selfish.

367
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:51,620
What the fuck is happening?

368
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,620
I don't know.

369
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,160
I'm trying to learn about gronking.

370
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:55,680
Jack?

371
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,000
You can't do that.

372
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:57,540
Stop it.

373
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,840
What is gronking?

374
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,720
How do I look up?

375
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,020
No, I want to...

376
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,360
Yay!

377
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:06,720
What?

378
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,340
Oh, I see.

379
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,320
Stop Jack Cashew from being selfish.

380
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,460
I don't know what the fuck that means.

381
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,240
I'm...

382
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,400
I need earrings.

383
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:21,900
Oh, Lily!

384
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,460
It's pitchforks facing top right.

385
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,500
Up right, pitchforks.

386
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:29,380
Three.

387
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,520
Yay!

388
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,700
Can someone help me get to 60 beauty?

389
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,780
Yeah, yeah.

390
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,340
I'm doing an easy task.

391
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,080
Let's go to the den.

392
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,120
Let's search the den.

393
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,140
I'm searching the den.

394
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,080
Okay, I didn't find it.

395
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,320
I'm going to the basement.

396
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,120
Okay, it's not there.

397
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,200
Okay, I'm going to go through the trash.

398
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,180
I'm going through the trash.

399
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,420
Does anyone want to join me for breakfast?

400
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:51,940
We got it.

401
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,260
Nobody knows us.

402
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,680
What the hell is going on right now?

403
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,460
This is like full house.

404
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,520
I don't get it.

405
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,400
I don't get it.

406
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,680
I don't know this game.

407
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,960
This is why nobody plays this game.

408
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,500
How can he tell?

409
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,480
Someone help him.

410
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,260
I just see people getting points.

411
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,600
You can't start this until everyone is here.

412
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,440
What does that mean?

413
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,700
I don't know.

414
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,860
I'm just doing...

415
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,160
Someone is doing a task.

416
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:24,520
What the fuck?

417
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,200
What is this?

418
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,480
The kitchen is on fire.

419
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:28,720
I'm sorry.

420
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:30,940
I caused an emergency.

421
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,000
Oh god.

422
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:33,560
Oh god.

423
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,660
How did I cause a fire?

424
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,460
What does that mean?

425
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,040
Wait, it's not me.

426
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,640
It says I'm not Doki Bird.

427
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,160
It wasn't me.

428
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,240
It wasn't me.

429
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:48,920
It wasn't me.

430
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,380
I get it.

431
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,160
It wasn't me.

432
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,280
I'm stopping Tenzin from being selfish, you selfish cunt.

433
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:57,820
Wait.

434
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,540
This is not a task?

435
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,900
Someone help me.

436
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,380
What is anti-Gronky?

437
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,380
Oh my god.

438
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,780
What am I listening to?

439
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,440
What is going on?

440
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:12,520
Oh my god.

441
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,380
He actually scores bad.

442
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,060
Stop.

443
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,360
Stop laughing juice.

444
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,600
He's being selfish.

445
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,320
No, no, I'm the best guy.

446
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,480
I'm the best fucking guy.

447
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,760
Guys, I might cause another fire.

448
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,520
Stop causing fires.

449
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,540
What the hell is your problem?

450
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,440
It's funny.

451
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,920
No, no, no.

452
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:45,360
It's a pink hat, a pink m'lady hat, light pink.

453
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,120
I hope you burn in hell.

454
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:46,560
Okay.

455
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,120
Is it?

456
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:48,340
Is it?

457
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,540
No, is it this?

458
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:52,080
Okay, we need the sprinklers to be off.

459
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:52,620
Okay, end of this.

460
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,740
Okay, so it needs to be off.

461
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,020
With the dial and the... oh god, not again.

462
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,020
What is this?

463
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,540
Oh, it's Peter!

464
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,200
Peter's house on fire!

465
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,680
Get rid of all that, get rid of all that.

466
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:06,780
Okay.

467
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,120
Oh god, this family's going to hell.

468
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:08,360
I can't do shit!

469
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,180
Oh my god, Peter.

470
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:10,700
Okay, okay.

471
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,620
How could you do that?

472
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,500
I hope you rot in hell.

473
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,540
Pink hat, light pink hat.

474
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:16,800
We need the pink hat.

475
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,540
We're already in hell.

476
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,460
What do you mean?

477
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:19,460
We need the pink hat.

478
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:19,560
We need the pink hat.

479
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,020
How is this what I'm doing?

480
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:21,680
Did you get it?

481
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,340
And the basement's flooded.

482
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:23,880
Who took a shit?

483
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,260
The basement's flooding.

484
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,200
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

485
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:25,440
What is it?

486
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,240
Goomy, that's you!

487
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,560
Goomy, what did he eat?

488
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,040
I'm sorry!

489
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:29,480
Goomy!

490
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,580
I'm sorry!

491
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,200
Oh god, I didn't do anything!

492
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,180
Okay, we good?

493
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:35,740
Okay, we good?

494
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,440
I'm help.

495
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,360
I'm help.

496
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:37,800
Sprinklers.

497
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:38,480
I'm helping Doki.

498
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,780
Who drew on the fucking walls, man?

499
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,000
Okay, Doki, what is the setting?

500
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,160
Off, off, middle.

501
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:42,880
Middle.

502
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,480
Who wants to ride a bike?

503
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,040
Who wants to learn how to ride a bike?

504
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:46,400
Middle?

505
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:46,420
Oh.

506
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,480
Oh my god.

507
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:47,960
Who?

508
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:48,960
Peter did!

509
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:53,860
Guys, it wasn't me.

510
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,500
I have no idea who started the fire.

511
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,800
It was not me.

512
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,600
I swear to god.

513
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,200
Honey, help.

514
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,180
Haircut, please.

515
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,420
Please, honey, help.

516
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,200
Two blue earrings.

517
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,060
Two blue earrings.

518
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:04,900
What?

519
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,240
What?

520
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,960
Golden moon earrings.

521
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:07,720
Two earrings.

522
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,600
Two earrings.

523
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,320
Crescent.

524
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:09,460
Four moons.

525
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:09,760
Okay, I got it.

526
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:10,240
I got it.

527
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:10,280
I got it.

528
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,200
Goomy, what is it?

529
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,480
Oh, Tenzin.

530
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:13,880
Um.

531
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:14,900
What am I supposed to do?

532
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,980
It's one short graph, one long.

533
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:17,700
I don't know.

534
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,320
I did it.

535
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:18,780
The fourth one.

536
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:19,580
DTD.

537
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,260
DTD.

538
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,180
And then Lopinus.

539
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,180
The second one is empty, empty, full.

540
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,140
And the third one is first notch.

541
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,860
Alright, I'm not doing this anymore.

542
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,960
Alright, I'm helping someone else.

543
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,020
What the fuck?

544
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:28,900
I don't know what's happening.

545
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,920
What do you want me to do, Goomy?

546
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:30,860
I don't know.

547
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,820
I'm not helping anymore.

548
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,680
Why do people stop me?

549
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,200
Did I do something bad?

550
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,000
I don't know how to ride a bike.

551
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,600
It isn't easy to ride a bike, kiddo.

552
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,460
Just hop on by swiping up.

553
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,880
You need to swipe up, kiddo.

554
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,480
Okay, Lily.

555
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:44,720
I'll help you.

556
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,200
Oh, god damn it.

557
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,380
Fucking hell.

558
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,700
Oh, no.

559
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,120
I can't do this.

560
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,460
I can't do this.

561
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,080
It's only day one.

562
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,120
It's only day one.

563
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,380
Tenzin said so many of the things I was doing.

564
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,500
I literally got nothing done.

565
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,960
I don't know what's going on.

566
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,320
I have to fly four times in day one.

567
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,020
You're supposed to read Meet the Green?

568
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:05,720
You're supposed to read Meet the Green?

569
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:05,840
Wait.

570
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,340
We didn't even go halfway there.

571
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,580
We did Gronk stuff, though.

572
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,520
We did Gronk.

573
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,800
Who the fuck was Gronking on company time?

574
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,420
I'm not a Gronk once or twice.

575
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,580
I think we may need to go to family therapy.

576
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,880
Peter, Peter, Peter.

577
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,120
It wasn't me.

578
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,200
It's all Grady.

579
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:28,260
Wait.

580
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,220
Did we all fail?

581
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:35,460
I just did my task and then it said, oh, Peter got greedy and I have to go out to fire three times.

582
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:35,700
Oh, no.

583
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,040
Okay.

584
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:36,920
That's Tenzin.

585
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,660
It wasn't me, though.

586
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,860
I saw a lot of Goomy and Peter.

587
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,520
I'm not going to lie.

588
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,040
Yeah, me too.

589
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:42,800
I just see them.

590
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,740
Jack, how about stop looking, then, you pervert?

591
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:47,280
What the hell?

592
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:47,900
Wait.

593
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,180
Stop doing something illegal.

594
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,420
It's okay.

595
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,520
They took our scores.

596
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,520
They took our scores already.

597
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,060
They got it.

598
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:56,640
Oh, okay.

599
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,920
I don't even know what our scores even was.

600
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,320
Did we win?

601
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,580
What was our score?

602
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:04,340
Oh, shit.

603
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,060
Oh, shit.

604
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:05,700
Oh, shit.

605
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,200
Wait.

606
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,120
I got second place?

607
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:07,560
Okay.

608
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,080
Let's go.

609
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:08,500
Wait.

610
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:08,880
Who got first?

611
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:09,940
I missed it.

612
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,520
What place was that?

613
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:10,960
I got third place?

614
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,200
That's so messed up.

615
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,160
That's so messed up.

616
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:14,820
Wait.

617
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,780
My team is ass.

618
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,940
Oh, whatever.

619
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:21,140
You guys are fucking garbage.

620
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:24,320
Everyone on my team had half my score.

621
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,000
Listen.

622
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:25,560
Listen.

623
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,980
Don't listen to him.

624
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,100
He doesn't need it.

625
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,800
You guys are terrible.

626
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,980
Lily, you won't be on our team.

627
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,520
We'll never call you ass.

628
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:35,540
We'll never call you ass.

629
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:35,680
Lily, don't listen to him.

630
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:40,560
Lily, remember, I helped you when nobody else helped you, Lily.

631
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,640
Are you guys serious?

632
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,020
Can I switch teams?

633
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,940
Can I go somewhere else?

634
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:46,200
Wait.

635
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,000
You can't say that when you had the lowest score.

636
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:49,760
Are you kidding me?

637
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:50,260
No.

638
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,620
Every time I did something, it said, oh, Peter got greedy.

639
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,300
Put out the fire.

640
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,420
That is true.

641
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,760
It did keep saying Peter got greedy and then set the house on fire.

642
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:03,480
I'm going to be so fucking real with you guys, I don't even know what that means.

643
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,220
I don't know what I was greeting.

644
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:09,900
You were clicking the red cast so you get extra points.

645
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:10,920
Yeah.

646
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,120
You get extra points by...

647
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,400
Wait, so why did your own teammates stop you?

648
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,720
Well, that's funny.

649
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,900
I have no idea.

650
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,000
But look at their scores.

651
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,300
Garbage.

652
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,160
You stopped me.

653
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,260
I didn't stop you.

654
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,120
I didn't know what I was doing.

655
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,780
You tried my best to raise you.

656
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,080
I wanted to win as a family, so I stopped everyone.

657
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,160
So clearly you guys know what I'm talking about.

658
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,020
Okay, but like, who won?

659
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,200
Did we win?

660
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,160
Who did we win?

661
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:37,900
We won.

662
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:38,440
We won.

663
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:38,860
Thank God.

664
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:39,180
Okay.

665
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,380
Your collective scores are way higher than ours.

666
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,180
So I'm assuming you won that one.

667
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,180
Yeah.

668
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,680
Like, all of you had at least 3k.

669
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,460
My team didn't even break two and a half.

670
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:49,980
Okay.

671
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,360
Well...

672
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,480
Listen, it's tough.

673
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,300
It's tough, Emily.

674
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,880
Stop me with Doki.

675
00:21:59,020 --> 00:21:59,680
Stop me with Doki.

676
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,200
Come on, man.

677
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,600
I am so down.

678
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,360
Honestly, do it.

679
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,000
Honestly, do it.

680
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:03,760
Please.

681
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,020
Retreat.

682
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:05,200
Retreat.

683
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,280
We don't want to...

684
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,000
Look at what you've done.

685
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,280
You broke this family apart.

686
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:10,980
I want a divorce.

687
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,920
I asked to be born into this family, okay?

688
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,320
You and everyone else.

689
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:18,800
All right.

690
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,540
We're just dropping.

691
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,280
Hey, good job, team.

692
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,340
I'm so happy we worked so well together.

693
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:23,700
Yay.

694
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,640
We tried our best, team.

695
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,020
We gave it our best shot.

696
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:31,960
I hate you.

697
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,540
Shut up.

698
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:33,700
Shut up.

699
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,140
Shut up.

700
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:34,460
Shut up.

701
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:34,680
Shut up.

702
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:34,780
Shut up.

703
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:35,020
Shut up.

704
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:35,960
You've got a Gd for f**king your ass.

705
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,420
You don't even know how to do chores.

706
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,240
You don't even know how to make money.

707
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,840
Fucking, fucking, fucking, fucking.

708
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:40,640
That is crazy.

709
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,260
You're probably the weirdest guy I ever know...

710
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:42,660
like I've met.

711
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,200
You...

712
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:44,860
you mean that?

713
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:46,760
Yes.

714
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,120
Guys, there's a new lobby code, but you guys are not in our lobby.

715
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:50,460
Yeah.

716
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,420
You guys have to leave.

717
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,240
Jeter's team move up.

718
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,120
Yeah, yeah.

719
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,060
You got to go lobby A.

720
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,520
What did you just say?

721
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,140
You don't mean that.

722
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:58,960
You don't mean that.

723
00:22:59,120 --> 00:22:59,900
I was hacked.

724
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,060
All right.

725
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,220
I hate you all.

726
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,280
I agree with him though.

727
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:04,540
Goodbye.

728
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,200
Bye.

729
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:05,460
Alright, GG!

730
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,800
Bye, guys!

731
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,660
Hey, good job, teammates!

732
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,680
I'm proud of you guys!

733
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,280
We did it!

734
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,000
Just to be clear, I got first, right?

735
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,100
Yeah, but it's a team score, so it doesn't matter.

736
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,000
But you got points for us.

737
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:25,020
I think you get extra money for being first, though, in general, right?

738
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,720
You looked so beautiful in the video, the little Twitch Rivals thing I saw.

739
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,300
That's so sweet!

740
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:36,980
So, does that mean you guys are going to throw for me, Goobie, or what's up?

741
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:37,900
No.

742
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,660
You don't understand what we just went through.

743
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,100
Did you guys know what was happening, either?

744
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,180
It was insane.

745
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,900
Actually, you guys have an LM over there, and...

746
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,000
Oh, God.

747
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,680
Who won on the other game?

748
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,600
How is there first to eighth?

749
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,440
There's more than eight...

750
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,940
How is there first to eighth for this?

751
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,120
Doki, stop asking questions you won't want answers to.

752
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:01,640
There's four teams.

753
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,000
Like, I don't want to...

754
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:10,100
There's eight people in one lobby.

755
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,480
Oh, so we're playing against each other.

756
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,480
But we're also on the same team, Doki.

757
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,520
Wake up!

758
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,540
Wake up!

759
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,180
Wake up!

760
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,540
That's surprising for a team!

761
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,200
Listen.

762
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,580
Just relax.

763
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:27,660
Have fun.

764
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,540
I'm so relaxed.

765
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,900
Everyone, the code is up.

766
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,660
You're probably going to lose anyways.

767
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,080
That's crazy.

768
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,480
I'm going to hand that one off to you, actually.

769
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:41,700
What's this?

770
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,440
This is Quiplash.

771
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,940
Okay, we all know Quiplash.

772
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,520
Alright, so we're leading up against each other now, right?

773
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:49,620
Yes.

774
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,580
There's no...

775
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,340
There's no team points here.

776
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,020
There's no pandering here.

777
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:55,580
Yeah.

778
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,460
This one, we don't need to show our stream, right?

779
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,040
No, no.

780
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,860
I'll let you just share the games from here.

781
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,820
You have to show the admin screen, not your own.

782
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:04,860
Got it.

783
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,820
I didn't show my own at all on my stream.

784
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,300
He hated me.

785
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,060
Okay.

786
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:08,840
Oh!

787
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:10,580
That's...

788
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,660
Okay, that makes sense.

789
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:12,740
No wonder we were confused.

790
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,160
Hey, Rudy.

791
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,120
Wait, we were supposed to show our screen last game?

792
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:18,980
Yeah.

793
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:19,920
I mean, you can.

794
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:20,840
I didn't.

795
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,940
I was too lazy for that.

796
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,820
We're not showing the Discord one?

797
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,440
Not this one.

798
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,620
You're showing Discord.

799
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,480
We are not showing the Discord.

800
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,640
Now you show the Discord one.

801
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

802
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:30,720
You show the Discord one.

803
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:31,540
Yes.

804
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,480
Oh, you know...

805
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,140
Guys, where's the code?

806
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,320
It's in lobby B.

807
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:40,680
It's in G2.

808
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:41,100
Yeah.

809
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:43,640
Oh, thanks.

810
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,160
Okay.

811
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:47,900
We're missing...

812
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,260
Now we show the Discord one is what you're saying.

813
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:51,500
Your...

814
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,880
We've always had to show the Discord...

815
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,740
Yvonne, I will ask you...

816
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:54,800
Huh?

817
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:55,700
Yeah.

818
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,340
But we're supposed to show the last one.

819
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:57,920
Last one?

820
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:58,360
Last one?

821
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:58,920
Yeah.

822
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,520
Well...

823
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,380
It was optional.

824
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,120
We're great streamers, guys.

825
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:05,420
Cool.

826
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,180
We got that.

827
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,080
We're going to Falling Directions.

828
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:08,340
Yeah.

829
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,080
Yeah.

830
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:09,680
I agree.

831
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:10,180
Yeah.

832
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:13,720
Okay.

833
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:19,950
We're all in.

834
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:21,290
Relax and relax.

835
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:24,090
Yippee.

836
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:28,550
What are you missing?

837
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:29,310
This music is so funky.

838
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:30,530
We're all here.

839
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:31,390
We just need the...

840
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:31,530
Oh.

841
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:31,970
Oh, it's OK to start.

842
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:36,790
Are they, like, streaming RPO?

843
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:37,990
Are they streaming this?

844
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:39,670
Is that why it's taking a bit?

845
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:44,230
You're confusing me, Toki.

846
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:44,610
Stop!

847
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:49,390
Oh, god.

848
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:50,410
Who's making that sound?

849
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:51,230
I'm already done.

850
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,930
I think it's Toki.

851
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:55,590
There is no way.

852
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,210
I think it's Toki.

853
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:56,970
There is no way.

854
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,050
Uh...

855
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:58,470
Roo!

856
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,110
Roo!

857
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:02,030
That's how Blanca sounds.

858
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:06,510
Have you practiced Blanca today, Gumi?

859
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:08,610
Hold on, I'm receiving a message.

860
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:09,370
Oh?

861
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:11,990
Whoa!

862
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:15,070
I can't see my cursor anymore.

863
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:16,390
How do I fix this?

864
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:18,590
I think you said...

865
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:19,710
Shut up.

866
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:23,310
I don't know what else the message said.

867
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:26,250
Man...

868
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:29,650
I hate when a pistachio doesn't have an opening for you to open it.

869
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,070
Whoa, pistachio.

870
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:31,630
Use your teeth.

871
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:32,770
Use your teeth.

872
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:33,770
Get in the cracker.

873
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,470
Oh, okay.

874
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:36,210
Pistachio.

875
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:37,430
Meow, meow, meow, meow.

876
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:39,490
Ow, it's really hard.

877
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:42,250
Meow, meow, meow, meow.

878
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:43,430
Pistachio?

879
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:43,810
How do you say it?

880
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:44,430
Pistachio?

881
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:47,870
It's too hard.

882
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:49,630
You crack me up.

883
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:50,690
I can't do it.

884
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,750
I'm gonna break my teeth.

885
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:58,210
I took these pistachios.

886
00:27:58,290 --> 00:27:59,310
From the karaoke place.

887
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:01,970
Dude, you're stealing now?

888
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:04,050
We paid for them.

889
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:05,590
They're so good.

890
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:09,010
We paid, right?

891
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:09,590
Wait, from when we went?

892
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:10,390
Yeah.

893
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,310
Bro, that was like a week ago.

894
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:14,230
I know.

895
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:15,550
My drunk ass brought them home.

896
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:18,230
Classic, Yvonne.

897
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,410
Stealing pistachios.

898
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:20,270
What a classic.

899
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:21,570
You're really good.

900
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,520
Who's swapping around?

901
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:29,560
Sorry.

902
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,620
The owners?

903
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:31,880
No, it's okay.

904
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,200
Do whatever you want.

905
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:36,120
What if we were supposed to start now, but we never realized?

906
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,860
No, I have the discord open.

907
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:39,920
They would tell us.

908
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:40,940
I trusted Ruby.

909
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:41,140
Yeah.

910
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,380
Thank you.

911
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,660
I muted myself.

912
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,640
There's too many people.

913
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,080
I thought...

914
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,120
Did you guys see icebreakers up there too?

915
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:59,680
I legitimately thought that we'd be in our own voice chat.

916
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,980
Yeah, we talked about the most embarrassing moment in our lives.

917
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:02,860
10 to 9 win.

918
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:03,120
Cause we are the worst.

919
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,340
I didn't realize we were combined with the other team.

920
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,160
I'm like, that's a lot of people in the...

921
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:15,560
Why is it every time I mute myself to talk to you guys, everybody starts talking?

922
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,460
I think it's our icebreaker when we just flamed Ellum.

923
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:19,600
Oh.

924
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:20,920
That's a really good icebreaker.

925
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:21,720
I thought it was pretty good.

926
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:22,540
Every time.

927
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:29,400
Which I saw the clip of after someone showed me and it was totally unprompted.

928
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:30,860
Unprompted?

929
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:31,360
What was it?

930
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:31,820
No, they asked me.

931
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:34,340
They didn't ask you who the worst player was?

932
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:34,940
Oh.

933
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:38,360
What?

934
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:39,200
What are you saying?

935
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:39,700
Wait, who got lost?

936
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,840
I don't think you're the worst player.

937
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,500
They didn't even ask you that.

938
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:45,200
You said it.

939
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,800
It's the crazy part.

940
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,060
Oh.

941
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,200
Our team is falling apart from the inside.

942
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,580
Listen, guys, this is what family game night is all about.

943
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:55,940
You know?

944
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:56,740
It is.

945
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,060
What's the friendly...

946
00:29:59,060 --> 00:29:59,840
That's true.

947
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:00,640
Between the two of us.

948
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,220
Banter.

949
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:01,640
What's the fun?

950
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:01,800
What's the fun?

951
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,320
Family game is all about helping your family get...

952
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,640
You would get just as much blame if we were not on stream.

953
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,080
That doesn't make it better.

954
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:10,740
It's like my mom.

955
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,000
I feel like it's like my mom.

956
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,020
Like my mom's here with us.

957
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,280
I think they get blamed way more off stream.

958
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:17,140
No.

959
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,860
If that makes you feel any better.

960
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,880
I like imagining Mi-young just being like, yeah, it's pretty hot today.

961
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,640
I woke up early.

962
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,640
Yvonne's our worst player.

963
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:27,380
Yeah.

964
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,220
That was...

965
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,140
That's her return.

966
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:30,540
It was.

967
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:31,800
Yeah.

968
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:36,920
She asked like a completely different question and Mi-young goes, oh, I thought you asked who her worst player was.

969
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,060
Not even the same.

970
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:40,360
I thought you were asking who the weakest link on our team would be.

971
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,820
And oh, I don't want to say names, but I think you'd be a ball on it.

972
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,800
I don't want to say names, but...

973
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:50,220
Listen.

974
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,720
I'll prove you guys all wrong one of these days.

975
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:58,520
I feel like that just makes it like what you do in the game very memorable.

976
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,500
Like that's what I remembered most out of our practice run.

977
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:01,800
Yeah.

978
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:02,420
I think I might just get one more ball.

979
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,980
Is twitch rivals PG 13.

980
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,260
Definitely not rated R.

981
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:12,760
Yeah.

982
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,860
This is a nasty game.

983
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:14,200
So...

984
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:19,580
Are they releasing a naughty pack for jack box?

985
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:20,480
Yeah.

986
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,540
You want to play it Doki?

987
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:22,180
Yeah.

988
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:22,980
They gave me a free code.

989
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:23,360
I have it.

990
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,320
I also have it.

991
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:25,860
Yeah.

992
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,980
It's called After Hours or something.

993
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:28,240
Yeah.

994
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:28,360
Yeah.

995
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,500
They're releasing an R18 jack box?

996
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:31,800
Oh my god.fold.

997
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,260
You're allowed to stream it too, they said.

998
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,600
As long as you put your stream on mature.

999
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:37,640
Yeah, yeah.

1000
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,200
I don't even know what kind of games were in it.

1001
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,300
They were just like, do you want free code?

1002
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,560
And I was like, I love free stuff.

1003
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,080
Yeah, sure.

1004
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:43,680
Don't care.

1005
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,700
We should have been streaming that game instead.

1006
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,160
I don't think they want that.

1007
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,700
No, they haven't said it yet.

1008
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,280
They're typing.

1009
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:58,620
Oh, we can start.

1010
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,400
Let's go.

1011
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,040
We can start now.

1012
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:03,420
Starting in 3, 2, 1.

1013
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,520
Wow, that's what I said.

1014
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,480
Woohoo.

1015
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:15,130
Quick blush.

1016
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:16,890
Quick blush.

1017
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:19,290
Surely we play honorably.

1018
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:20,610
Yeah.

1019
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:21,770
Mm-hmm.

1020
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:28,090
And before you ask, no, I'm not related to the Schmitzensteins who live down the street from you.

1021
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,470
I was curious, yeah.

1022
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:31,110
One.

1023
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,850
But it's round one.

1024
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:35,290
Two prompts will show up on your device.

1025
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,450
Answer them however the mood strikes.

1026
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:39,430
You'll go head to head against someone else.

1027
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:42,830
Everybody else's clever answer and everybody else will decide which one they like better.

1028
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:46,510
Points are awarded based on the percentage of people who went for your answer.

1029
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:47,570
So make them count.

1030
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:51,990
Is anyone else sweating?

1031
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:53,210
No.

1032
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:54,430
I'm really nervous.

1033
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:58,170
Okay.

1034
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:28,870
Nice.

1035
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:32,350
Wait, is there audience participation for this one?

1036
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:34,050
I'm not sure.

1037
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:35,930
The code's on the top right.

1038
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,030
Yeah, there's a code there.

1039
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:38,490
All I see is one moderator.

1040
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:43,690
Oh, there isn't.

1041
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:45,330
My chat said there's no audience participation.

1042
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:51,270
I'm done.

1043
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:53,230
Am I the only one?

1044
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:53,450
Wait.

1045
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,000
What is a safety quip?

1046
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,840
What do you get for safety quips?

1047
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:18,820
Safety.

1048
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:25,300
Uh, the safety quip just gives you like a random generated answer.

1049
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:25,660
Oh.

1050
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,920
Wouldn't it be funny if you win with that?

1051
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:32,840
Also, everyone, they said keep the answer safe for work.

1052
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:33,500
Oh.

1053
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:34,580
Oh!

1054
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,120
Oh.

1055
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:35,860
Uh-oh.

1056
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:38,800
Tenzin?

1057
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:40,960
Wait, what happened?

1058
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,300
Oh, wow.

1059
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,780
I hope this doesn't say it.

1060
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,100
Aweeeeee.

1061
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,930
A black smith forge?

1062
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:53,500
There's nothing wrong with those ones.

1063
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:54,120
Ah.

1064
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:01,320
Oh.

1065
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,580
The safety quip.

1066
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,160
That's a safety quip.

1067
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,820
I couldn't think of anything PG, so I used the safety quip.

1068
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,700
I didn't work.

1069
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:12,360
I didn't work.

1070
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,200
The one with the .

1071
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:13,340
Is it a還 with the .

1072
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,060
You're a five year old.

1073
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,040
She's right.

1074
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:20,460
Oh, my gosh.

1075
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,500
Oh, my gosh.

1076
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:25,440
I feel like they should have told us that it should be PG earlier.

1077
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:30,520
We've been talking about this for like 20 minutes.

1078
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,340
That was crazy.

1079
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,800
How are half of you not voting at all?

1080
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,640
I voted!

1081
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,340
I would like to apologize.

1082
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:44,020
The first answer got me stun locked.

1083
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,640
Yeah, me too.

1084
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,080
What are you guys doing?

1085
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,300
What is going on?

1086
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:50,720
Oh my god!

1087
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:56,200
Wait, can you get disqualified?

1088
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:57,180
Yvonne!

1089
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,920
I'm racking in the points!

1090
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,240
I'm racking in the points!

1091
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,360
I did my job!

1092
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,000
I did my job!

1093
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,960
Yvonne, we gotta have a talk.

1094
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,620
Tell me I'm wrong.

1095
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,140
What the fucker?

1096
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,680
What is this?

1097
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,260
I didn't vote.

1098
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,460
I just, I couldn't.

1099
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,300
I don't understand.

1100
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,820
You're not allowed.

1101
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,860
Penn, do you want to explain?

1102
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:35,260
If you want to be a supermodel, squat down on the runway and then blank.

1103
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:43,180
If you want to be a supermodel, stretch to the end of the ramp.

1104
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,720
The bust out of your face is definitely a safety cue.

1105
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,380
A safety cue.

1106
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:46,760
Yeah, yeah.

1107
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:47,820
What?

1108
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,520
That is not...

1109
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,840
I thought it was a safety cue.

1110
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,340
Damn, you suck, Yvonne.

1111
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,480
That was not a safety one.

1112
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,480
It wasn't?

1113
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:02,080
You're a supermodel and you don't get it?

1114
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,520
That was both.

1115
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,840
That was clever.

1116
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,180
I think that's someone's personal pet peeve.

1117
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,420
The mirror?

1118
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,920
I don't know.

1119
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,780
I'm assuming that's what people would say.

1120
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,980
Damn, you guys still like the mirror, huh?

1121
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,280
Wait, what does...

1122
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:21,860
It's in the intro.

1123
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,760
What does the mirror mean?

1124
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,520
I love that for you, Doki.

1125
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,420
Wait, what is that?

1126
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,540
Is that the newest word?

1127
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:31,620
I abstain.

1128
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,120
What is this?

1129
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,780
Oh, there's only one right answer here.

1130
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:41,980
That's crazy.

1131
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,860
And that was not it.

1132
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,380
That was a safety quip?

1133
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:47,600
Thank you, Matt.

1134
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,460
Yes.

1135
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,000
Abusing the system.

1136
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,780
Um, the worst thing to be inscribed...

1137
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,280
Wait, welcome home feels pretty good.

1138
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,400
Yeah.

1139
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:00,860
Thank you.

1140
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:07,280
I wrote something that would disgust me and make me want to not enter the home.

1141
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:07,820
It is kind of close to welcome home.

1142
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,760
Yes, that's what I was going for.

1143
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:10,180
Thank you.

1144
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:11,820
Yep, got you.

1145
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,220
But that's what makes it good.

1146
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,020
Why nobody voted on it?

1147
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,220
Because we want that.

1148
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,140
Yeah, because it's a good one.

1149
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:20,500
Yeah.

1150
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,940
We're taking the word back.

1151
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:24,920
Oh, okay.

1152
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:27,620
Damn.

1153
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:28,980
Oh.

1154
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:29,760
Hey, high five.

1155
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,200
My fault.

1156
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,140
My fault.

1157
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:31,760
I guess I'm the best.

1158
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,100
Oh, okay.

1159
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:33,680
Okay.

1160
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:34,160
Yeah.

1161
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:35,920
Oh, they're doubled.

1162
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,660
We were only sandbagging the first one, right?

1163
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:39,540
Yeah.

1164
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:40,020
Yeah.

1165
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,940
We can be actually funny, right?

1166
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,700
Like, all of us can actually be funny.

1167
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,080
So, are we keeping this PG or...?

1168
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,720
Yeah, PG.

1169
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:38,220
Wait, for a safety quip, do they like automatically submit an answer for you?

1170
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:38,640
Yeah.

1171
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:38,900
Yeah.

1172
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:39,400
Yeah.

1173
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,740
So, you don't even have to see what they wrote.

1174
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,360
Time.

1175
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,740
Don't forget your safety quips.

1176
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,180
I guess it's technically PG.

1177
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,440
If you have a PG mind.

1178
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:14,860
True.

1179
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,500
Moderation is still in progress.

1180
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,840
So, if you got...

1181
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:18,960
Yeah.

1182
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:19,840
Yeah.

1183
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:20,280
You think?

1184
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,500
My answer could be PG.

1185
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:22,560
Okay.

1186
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,680
If there's moderation, that means they're vetting our answers.

1187
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,300
Therefore, the last ones were okay.

1188
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:27,960
Yeah.

1189
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:28,400
Wait.

1190
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:28,940
That means...

1191
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:29,640
That means...

1192
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:29,980
Wait.

1193
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:30,900
Aren't you the moderator?

1194
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:31,720
Someone was being weird.

1195
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:32,800
No, no, no.

1196
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,540
I'm just a VIP.

1197
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:34,300
Oh.

1198
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,400
Wait.

1199
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:35,880
What happened?

1200
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:37,780
What?

1201
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,380
Let's do this.

1202
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:42,260
Okay.

1203
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,880
I think my answer got vetted then.

1204
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,180
It automatically got vetted.

1205
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:47,320
It automatically got vetted.

1206
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,060
It automatically got vetted.

1207
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:51,000
It automatically stumped me when they said PG.

1208
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,260
Everybody forgets that one episode.

1209
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,380
I'm gonna say...

1210
00:40:59,380 --> 00:40:59,760
What?

1211
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:00,820
The wrong one is Yvonne's.

1212
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,280
That's not me.

1213
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,040
I didn't vote.

1214
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,040
I'll vote for it.

1215
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:08,800
Wow.

1216
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,620
That was a safety quip.

1217
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,420
I've never watched Friends before.

1218
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,060
Me too.

1219
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,340
I'm just like...

1220
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:16,600
Stand-up comedy Netflix special.

1221
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:20,640
Okay.

1222
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:21,960
Now it gets real.

1223
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,040
Pick your favorite.

1224
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,020
That's PG, right?

1225
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:26,600
It's just...

1226
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:26,860
Yeah.

1227
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,020
Yeah.

1228
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:27,240
Yeah.

1229
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:27,740
Yeah.

1230
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:28,920
Yeah.

1231
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:29,740
Technically, it's PG.

1232
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:29,940
Yeah.

1233
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:32,800
It's like when they drop a joke in like a Pixar movie.

1234
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:33,300
Yeah.

1235
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:33,500
Yeah.

1236
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:33,820
Yeah.

1237
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,500
When you...

1238
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,460
Because you're laughing so hard, you know?

1239
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:39,920
That's PG.

1240
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:40,520
That was funny.

1241
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,480
So the tears come out and make you wet.

1242
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:44,000
The tears.

1243
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:45,500
Yeah.

1244
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:46,540
It's the tears.

1245
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:47,520
I get it.

1246
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,300
You like this.

1247
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:50,920
So you can act.

1248
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,280
Yeah.

1249
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,060
I don't talk to women in real life, so...

1250
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:03,010
That is a crazy safety quip.

1251
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:06,830
What on earth?

1252
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:08,710
Do you lose points for not voting?

1253
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:10,250
Oh.

1254
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:11,690
No.

1255
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:12,470
I don't think so.

1256
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:13,050
Oh.

1257
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:15,470
I could be wrong though.

1258
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:16,630
Actually, I have no idea.

1259
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:17,390
I don't know why I said I don't think so.

1260
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:18,290
But I think you get points for voting.

1261
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:18,990
Yeah.

1262
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:19,810
These both...

1263
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:20,310
I don't know.

1264
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:21,230
Are these both safety quips?

1265
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:21,490
No.

1266
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:22,290
Don't tell her that.

1267
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:23,930
She's going to abstain from voting.

1268
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:31,170
They're both safety quips?

1269
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:33,210
I didn't know.

1270
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:33,930
I didn't know.

1271
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:34,570
Okay.

1272
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:35,250
Firm handshakes.

1273
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:35,830
Firm handshakes.

1274
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:38,810
The law and order sound should play whatever blank.

1275
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:39,130
Dun dun.

1276
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:40,550
Whatever.

1277
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:44,650
What?

1278
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:46,930
Okay.

1279
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:48,710
That's a vote for me.

1280
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:51,590
What's...

1281
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:51,850
What?

1282
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:52,350
What?

1283
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:53,170
What's the sound?

1284
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:55,270
Bum bum.

1285
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:01,750
Oh no.

1286
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:02,490
Abe.

1287
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:05,630
The real reason sharks won't go on land.

1288
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:06,790
Okay.

1289
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:11,070
It gets real.

1290
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:12,150
Pick your favorite.

1291
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:12,910
Oh.

1292
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:13,810
Oh.

1293
00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:14,710
That was a good one.

1294
00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:16,170
Yeah.

1295
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:18,090
And the people that get it, get it.

1296
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:19,310
Thank you.

1297
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:19,830
Thank you.

1298
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:21,830
I'm sorry.

1299
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:22,490
I love Sharknado.

1300
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:25,770
Tengu was cocking up, but she was laughing at the wrong one.

1301
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:29,810
I want to speak to your manager.

1302
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:33,190
What?

1303
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:35,350
And Mel, pick your favorite.

1304
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:36,630
I think that was a safety one.

1305
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:38,550
The first one's a safety quip for sure.

1306
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:38,950
Yeah.

1307
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:41,210
I'm going to vote for the safety.

1308
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:42,310
I like it a lot.

1309
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:44,690
Sometimes the AI is funnier.

1310
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:45,510
Yeah, it is.

1311
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:49,230
Sure that one's safety.

1312
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:50,270
That's crazy.

1313
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:51,150
No way to say thank you.

1314
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:51,290
Got it.

1315
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:51,370
Thank you.

1316
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:51,830
Thank you.

1317
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:52,650
Okay.

1318
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:52,690
You reached the second question.

1319
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:53,530
So pretty safe.

1320
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:54,570
You know what, that was a good one.

1321
00:43:54,570 --> 00:44:00,570
Moving right along, the last thing an art museum security guard wants to find at night.

1322
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:03,510
Calm.

1323
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:05,470
All right, people.

1324
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:06,570
It's voting time.

1325
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:09,550
That is insane.

1326
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:10,550
You guys are crazy.

1327
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:14,530
You guys, that's PG, right?

1328
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:15,030
That's...

1329
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:18,470
They're just casting spells.

1330
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:19,410
Like, come on.

1331
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:20,290
Yeah.

1332
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:20,910
It's...

1333
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:22,290
A magic wand!

1334
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:23,590
It's like a magician, right?

1335
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:25,230
Wow, that's it for round 2?

1336
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:26,890
Wait, there was a magic wand earlier?

1337
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:27,970
Let's see your scores!

1338
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:30,030
Yep, your mom's.

1339
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:31,250
Oh!

1340
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:38,320
Ow, it hurts down here!

1341
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:39,920
I guess I'm still the best.

1342
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,620
It's okay, it's triple the points!

1343
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:42,260
Yeah, triple!

1344
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,680
This is where it all matters!

1345
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,320
This is when you can actually be funny.

1346
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you guys were sandbagging.

1347
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:49,640
Yeah, we were just sandbagging, guys, right?

1348
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:52,300
I'm gonna actually write a funny response.

1349
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,480
Through triplash?

1350
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:57,520
Okay, okay.

1351
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,140
And by write, I mean I'm doing a safe...

1352
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:00,640
What?

1353
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:01,960
I'm not sweating this way.

1354
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:03,800
I'm not sweating this way.

1355
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:04,320
Okay.

1356
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:08,360
Bikini.

1357
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,000
Chicken suit.

1358
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:12,680
Huh?

1359
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,400
Oh, where's the safety quip?

1360
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,700
Where's the safety quip?

1361
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,140
I'm trying to brain blast so hard.

1362
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:34,400
Oh, no.

1363
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:35,460
There's no safety.

1364
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:36,580
What do you do?

1365
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:41,980
Do something.

1366
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,480
Okay, my answer's not funny.

1367
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:15,460
I just, I didn't know how to deal with this.

1368
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:16,360
Same.

1369
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,420
Awful, but I can't...

1370
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:25,340
There's too many stuff we have to write down.

1371
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:26,740
I can't go beyond one.

1372
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:27,260
Mine was so lame!

1373
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:28,560
So bad!

1374
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:30,200
That's so bad.

1375
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,000
I'm gonna cry.

1376
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:33,340
The one time we need a safety quip.

1377
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:35,080
It doesn't give it to us.

1378
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:35,880
I know!

1379
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:45,950
Wait, who are we?

1380
00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:47,050
Oh, it's the moderator.

1381
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:47,990
I was like...

1382
00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:50,250
Who wrote something crazy?

1383
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:51,110
Confess.

1384
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:51,950
Who did it?

1385
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:53,210
It's, I know it's not me.

1386
00:46:53,350 --> 00:46:54,830
My, my answer's dumb.

1387
00:46:54,970 --> 00:46:56,390
My answer's dumb!

1388
00:46:58,550 --> 00:46:59,750
It's so PG.

1389
00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:05,730
Three odd outfit choices for a horror movie slasher to wear.

1390
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:12,120
Oh.

1391
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:12,400
Oh.

1392
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,140
Now it's time to vote for your favorite.

1393
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:18,180
What is a kissing emoji outfit?

1394
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:19,040
Yeah, what is that?

1395
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:20,220
I don't know, but I'm into it.

1396
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:23,060
Like, a suit with kissing emojis printed on it?

1397
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:29,480
I'm going with my head cannon.

1398
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:33,620
I'm just voting for the points.

1399
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:37,500
I need the extra points.

1400
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:43,820
Three signs that your neighbor is upset with you.

1401
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:44,660
Oh.

1402
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:48,220
W.

1403
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:52,000
W.

1404
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:06,100
What?

1405
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:11,900
The W is funny!

1406
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,760
I don't know, like you're all laughing at me, but you're not laughing at me.

1407
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:17,060
Yeah, I voted!

1408
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:17,880
I voted!

1409
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:20,500
We're laughing at you, not with you.

1410
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:23,620
The W carried your answer.

1411
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:28,060
Whoa!

1412
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:33,240
I mean, that's pandering.

1413
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,360
I would be like the boss, right?

1414
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,520
Wait, why is Broden in there with those two?

1415
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,040
No, no, I felt like you need some height.

1416
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,220
Wow, okay.

1417
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,480
Okay, wow.

1418
00:48:57,940 --> 00:48:58,540
Wow.

1419
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:01,420
Okay.

1420
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:05,660
I don't know what Dimir is, so I can't vote for that.

1421
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,040
Nobody explain Dimir.

1422
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:13,760
This crowd doesn't know Dimir, man.

1423
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,440
They don't get it.

1424
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:18,440
They're not on the talk, bro.

1425
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,800
No, we do.

1426
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:22,100
They're not on the talk.

1427
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:22,900
It's not my fault.

1428
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:23,540
I hate to say it.

1429
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:26,480
No, it's been too... it's past date, man.

1430
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:27,080
It's expired.

1431
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:31,600
Damn, Abe, you went for the Christmas.

1432
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:32,380
Wow!

1433
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,200
Thank you, Goo.

1434
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,040
We appreciate you.

1435
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:35,600
Thank you!

1436
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:36,440
Yay, yay, yay!

1437
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:37,100
That's crazy.

1438
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:42,280
We did it!

1439
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:43,420
Individually!

1440
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,480
Wow, Blank Smith Forge.

1441
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,020
We did it!

1442
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:47,860
Yay!

1443
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:52,680
Wow, the VIP won.

1444
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:54,400
It could've... was it rigged?

1445
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:55,000
Rigged?

1446
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:55,580
Rigged?

1447
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:56,220
The question mark?

1448
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:56,600
What?

1449
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:57,000
What?

1450
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:58,900
I just have to mention...

1451
00:49:58,900 --> 00:49:59,260
It's okay, literally.

1452
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,200
I'll make sure it's not rigged.

1453
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:04,920
Seems somebody was pandering.

1454
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,740
Woo, no laughs!

1455
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:11,020
Yeah!

1456
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:12,120
Fourth!

1457
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:16,600
Alright, what's the next game?

1458
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:19,600
Oh, we're going Trivia Murder Party.

1459
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:21,580
Against LM's team.

1460
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,780
Okay, that's a team game, right?

1461
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:25,360
Or is it individual?

1462
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:29,720
No, it's still... everything's individual if you think about it.

1463
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,040
Unless you yell out the answer.

1464
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:32,400
Wait, they're all individual?

1465
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,180
Oh, that's true!

1466
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,700
Everyone whisper the answers into your teammates' ear.

1467
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,680
Why are we in a team, then?

1468
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:39,720
Say it, Quirk.

1469
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:45,840
Whoever wins will also help their team get further in the leaderboard.

1470
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:48,560
And then someone will be really loud and yell out the answer.

1471
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:49,200
Oh!

1472
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:51,880
Yeah, Doki, you would be great at that.

1473
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:54,580
Oh, wait!

1474
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:56,280
There's no rules against chat.

1475
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:56,520
She knows.

1476
00:50:58,020 --> 00:50:58,960
Doki, please!

1477
00:50:59,460 --> 00:50:59,980
Please!

1478
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:04,660
This isn't you.

1479
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:06,860
It is you, though, actually.

1480
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:15,830
Okay, I'll make sure I won't look at... I won't have my face turned to chat.

1481
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,660
I'll give it five seconds before I look.

1482
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:25,120
Guys, don't worry.

1483
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,000
There's definitely a stream delay.

1484
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,500
Guys, I won't use Google.

1485
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:36,420
Wait, so this is gonna be... this is gonna be... whose chat is smarter?

1486
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:39,400
Yeah, it's basically whose chat is smarter.

1487
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:40,780
I don't feel like I have time to Google.

1488
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,660
Like, these things are quick.

1489
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:43,220
There's a delay.

1490
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,320
There's a delay.

1491
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:45,980
Yeah, there's a delay.

1492
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:50,360
So, like, if you just wanted to say out random answers, like, it's fine.

1493
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1494
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,060
Show how smart you are, you know what I mean?

1495
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:56,440
Yeah, guys, you guys love backseating, right?

1496
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:57,360
This is your chance.

1497
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:58,180
Exactly.

1498
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:05,080
Whichever chat... yeah, we're here... it's not, like, whichever streamer's smarter is whichever chat's the best backseater.

1499
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:06,480
We're about to get tagged.

1500
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:09,680
Yeah, you know how you always get banned for backseating?

1501
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:12,800
This is the one time this is your job.

1502
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,640
You can backseat your streamer.

1503
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:16,240
Yeah.

1504
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:21,900
Anyone else's chat saying we're doomed or, like, is everyone else's chat on it?

1505
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:23,600
Mine's saying gg easy.

1506
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:25,680
They said, so we get a cut?

1507
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:30,200
You get recognition from the streamer.

1508
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:40,400
I will read your name out if you give me the right answer.

1509
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:43,420
Uh...

1510
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:47,900
It'll be that easy.

1511
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:50,720
No, you guys... yeah, you guys get a cut, alright?

1512
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:54,920
Exposure, you know?

1513
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:57,520
For the exposure, guys.

1514
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:02,020
Are we still lobby B?

1515
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:05,280
No, we're in lobby A, buddy.

1516
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:05,760
No!

1517
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:06,360
Let me hit them.

1518
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:08,240
I don't wanna move.

1519
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:09,340
Like, I don't move!

1520
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,000
Nice.

1521
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:14,160
It's just moving?

1522
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,040
It's just a scroll and a click away.

1523
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:17,600
That's too much.

1524
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:18,000
That's too much.

1525
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:18,720
Yeah, that is.

1526
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:20,640
That's too much.

1527
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:21,020
Oh.

1528
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:22,320
Okay.

1529
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:24,720
And then I gotta just do trivia after?

1530
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:26,060
Sorry, Ka-chan.

1531
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:28,160
Let's push the button.

1532
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:29,680
Do we push the button?

1533
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:31,700
Oy, oy, oy.

1534
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:39,100
That was, like, the icebreaker.

1535
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:40,020
Is that the...

1536
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:44,940
How are they still...

1537
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:46,540
How are they still playing their game?

1538
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:49,120
Like, it's not a lot.

1539
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:52,480
Everything's timed, like, exactly the same.

1540
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:55,820
They're still thinking about their answers?

1541
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,860
No, I think they're also done.

1542
00:53:58,020 --> 00:53:59,140
Okay, I was gonna say.

1543
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:00,740
How are they still there?

1544
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,740
It's like 60 seconds.

1545
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:04,460
They're in an ad break.

1546
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:07,440
Oh, they get an ad break.

1547
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:08,260
Oh.

1548
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:13,240
Okay, it's time to move.

1549
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:14,720
Okay.

1550
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:14,840
Okay.

1551
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:16,540
Hello.

1552
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:19,740
I heard that was, like, Mafia or something.

1553
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:20,360
Oh.

1554
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:20,980
Hello.

1555
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:22,460
Hello.

1556
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:24,380
Hello.

1557
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:25,440
Hello.

1558
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:26,260
Hello.

1559
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:26,660
Hello.

1560
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:27,340
Hello.

1561
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:27,920
Hello.

1562
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:28,660
Hello.

1563
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:32,160
That's me wiping your bald head on the floor.

1564
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:32,580
What?

1565
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:34,420
I'm not even bald.

1566
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:35,820
I'm not even balding.

1567
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:36,140
Not yet.

1568
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:36,760
Not yet.

1569
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:37,360
Not yet.

1570
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:38,260
Not yet.

1571
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:39,680
I'm not balding.

1572
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:40,200
I'm not balding.

1573
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:40,440
Guys.

1574
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:40,920
Guys.

1575
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:41,800
Please don't know who I am.

1576
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:43,260
Wig.

1577
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:43,820
Wig.

1578
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:46,940
Oh, that's me grabbing it to the top of your head.

1579
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:47,520
I have no idea.

1580
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,020
What do you mean you carry balls all the time?

1581
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:50,540
What do you mean?

1582
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:52,060
Yeah, I need some balls my bro.

1583
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,640
Maybe it's fucking not gross.

1584
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:54,660
It's your fault.

1585
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:54,840
Whoa.

1586
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:56,700
Lobby's almost out.

1587
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:58,100
Wait is lobby code?

1588
00:54:58,180 --> 00:54:58,860
Lobby code's out.

1589
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:01,520
Okay, who wants to be VIP?

1590
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,720
So, I don't think I've met everyone in this lobby, but nice to meet you, I'm Josh.

1591
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:06,120
Pleasure to meet you guys.

1592
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:06,120
Hi, guys.

1593
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,100
If I haven't met you... Hi, Jack.

1594
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:09,380
Okay.

1595
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:10,980
My name's Jack, too.

1596
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:11,400
What's up, man?

1597
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,200
Oh, wait.

1598
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:13,560
You, too?

1599
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,100
My name's Jack, as well.

1600
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,180
What the hell up, Josh?

1601
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:20,880
How do you know it's Josh?

1602
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:23,820
It's my middle name.

1603
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,480
I'm Josh Jack Bingo.

1604
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:26,000
You didn't know that?

1605
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:26,680
You didn't know that?

1606
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:29,020
Wait, did you just dox yourself?

1607
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:31,520
No, actually, my middle name's actually Max.

1608
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:33,480
What's up?

1609
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,220
What's your mom's maiden name?

1610
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:37,520
What's your mom's maiden name?

1611
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:38,300
Yeah, what is it?

1612
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,700
And also the name of your first dog?

1613
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:43,840
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1614
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,420
And what elementary school you went to?

1615
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:46,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1616
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:49,880
What was your teacher's first name?

1617
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:53,020
That was your teacher's first name?

1618
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:53,600
Yeah.

1619
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,080
First car model, too?

1620
00:55:58,860 --> 00:55:59,700
Oh, God.

1621
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:00,540
Oh, God.

1622
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,780
They're asking all the big questions.

1623
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,580
The thing is, I wouldn't end up answering that.

1624
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:06,020
Like, I genuinely would end up answering that.

1625
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:06,900
I wouldn't even think about it.

1626
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:09,760
And all of a sudden, I'm having to change my name.

1627
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,840
Maybe that's how I don't become a Bingo anymore.

1628
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:16,180
I dox myself entirely, and then my entire family's forced to change the name.

1629
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,680
The lineage ends with me, and then I become something cool.

1630
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:20,800
Whoa, wait, good job, everyone.

1631
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:21,840
We're all in here.

1632
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:23,720
Does that movie start now?

1633
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,360
They make you wait.

1634
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:28,360
They're like, yeah.

1635
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:29,780
Oh, God.

1636
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:30,760
I'm hungry.

1637
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:31,760
I want some chicken wings.

1638
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,300
Oh, you should go and get food right now.

1639
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:37,700
They won't be ready to start yet when you come back.

1640
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:38,220
So don't worry.

1641
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:40,180
No, no, no.

1642
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:41,840
You should go.

1643
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:42,980
Go get food.

1644
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,580
Guys, I'm eating some chips.

1645
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,000
I hope we start the game now.

1646
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:48,720
Anyone want to play Roblox?

1647
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:51,680
I've never played Roblox before.

1648
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:54,240
Wait, you've never played Roblox before?

1649
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:56,120
No, I haven't.

1650
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:56,760
Wait, no.

1651
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:00,200
You can see me eating.

1652
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:00,820
It's crazy.

1653
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:01,500
Look at that.

1654
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:02,800
It's like I'm keeping my purity.

1655
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:08,380
Guys, I got not one, but two baby bells.

1656
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:09,960
What's a baby bell?

1657
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:11,680
You know, I knew you would get cheese.

1658
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:13,620
It's a cheese wheel.

1659
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:14,700
I got a cheese wheel.

1660
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,560
Are you just eating the cheese like that?

1661
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:19,000
Oh, no.

1662
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:19,640
Okay, trust me.

1663
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:21,740
This isn't even back in the day.

1664
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:24,720
I would happily now eat cheese from the block like a rat.

1665
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:25,900
Oh, my God.

1666
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:27,100
What the heck?

1667
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:28,620
You should do that.

1668
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:29,300
It's literally from the block.

1669
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:30,880
Is your heart okay?

1670
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,460
I could die at any moment.

1671
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:39,960
It was the last time you got a checkup.

1672
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:41,960
It was the last time you got a checkup.

1673
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:42,800
It's been a while, it's been a while.

1674
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:46,220
Now you're coming to America, dude.

1675
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:46,660
Good luck.

1676
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:47,860
Yeah, shit, bro.

1677
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:49,560
That would be $5,000.

1678
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:52,220
For them to touch your... never mind.

1679
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,700
Touch your... finish the sentence.

1680
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:56,220
What did they want?

1681
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:58,580
The doctor touched me.

1682
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:00,340
Make sure you cough, Alan.

1683
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:01,000
Make sure you cough.

1684
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:03,800
What the...

1685
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:05,740
Wait, are you my doctor?

1686
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:06,580
I'm down.

1687
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:08,040
Free checkup.

1688
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:12,120
That's why I go right there.

1689
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,220
Gotta make sure you're healthy, big man.

1690
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:18,140
What kind of chips you got?

1691
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:18,880
I'm not balding.

1692
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:22,180
Dude, I've never had Cheetos before.

1693
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:23,340
I'm unmuted.

1694
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:26,700
Wait, I had Cheetos today, too.

1695
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:28,320
I was talking to chat.

1696
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:29,320
I didn't know I was unmuted.

1697
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:30,220
There's nothing wrong.

1698
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:30,800
We can discuss it.

1699
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:34,400
Yeah, I got some hot Cheetos.

1700
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:35,540
Oh, hot Cheetos.

1701
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:35,840
Never mind.

1702
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:38,700
Is that good crisp?

1703
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:39,700
You like that red 40?

1704
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:41,340
Yeah.

1705
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:43,840
I got a Mulch Max with my...

1706
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:46,540
What is a Mulch Max?

1707
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:48,380
Hey, Doki, you stream on YouTube, right?

1708
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,760
No, I'm on Twitch today because it's Twitch Rivals.

1709
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:52,160
Oh, true.

1710
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:58,200
Oh, I was gonna say it'd be crazy if you won the SF tournament at TwitchCon.

1711
00:58:59,240 --> 00:58:59,920
Oh, yeah.

1712
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:01,360
I don't even go there.

1713
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:03,960
Yeah, that'd be kind of funny.

1714
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,320
When are we gonna start the game?

1715
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:11,300
It's time to go, guys.

1716
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:12,020
It's an ad break.

1717
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:14,340
They gotta get their ad revenue.

1718
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:15,940
Yeah, the Myth Walker.

1719
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:17,980
They ran like 10 ads.

1720
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:19,160
Give us a sec.

1721
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:22,240
I just wanna play trivia, guys.

1722
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:23,280
I'm so good at it.

1723
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:25,280
You mean your chat's so good at it.

1724
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:27,800
Sorry, Doki.

1725
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:28,560
Are you cheating?

1726
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:29,900
You're a cheater.

1727
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:30,260
You're a cheater.

1728
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:30,800
Reporting.

1729
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:31,460
Reporting.

1730
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:33,420
Oh, jokes on you.

1731
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:34,640
It's not in the rules.

1732
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:36,640
It's not in the rules.

1733
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:37,960
I'm gonna cheat my ass off.

1734
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:42,920
This is the moment your backseaters can shine.

1735
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:43,900
Yeah.

1736
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,940
Can you give me a fun fact?

1737
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:48,420
Are you asking me to chat?

1738
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:50,800
I'm not asking you, not my chat.

1739
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:52,720
I'm asking you.

1740
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:54,560
Can we get a fun fact real quick?

1741
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,380
I'm practicing right now.

1742
00:59:57,180 --> 00:59:58,860
Mosquitoes have 47 teeth.

1743
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:01,020
What?

1744
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:01,600
Wait, what does?

1745
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:04,160
Mosquitoes have 47 teeth.

1746
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:05,660
Oh.

1747
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:06,400
They have teeth?

1748
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:08,040
That's what I'm saying.

1749
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:11,020
It's like these little sharp edges, but people call them teeth.

1750
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:11,580
Don't they have a spout?

1751
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:13,380
A spout.

1752
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:16,920
They have little teeth on them, like the little sharp thingies.

1753
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,320
That's how they suck your blood.

1754
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:21,420
Oh yeah, they have to bite the skin.

1755
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:22,820
They bite the skin.

1756
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:23,940
Oh.

1757
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:27,340
Australia has wires in the moon?

1758
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:28,380
Okay.

1759
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:30,940
That's a fun fact.

1760
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:34,080
I'm gonna be sorry with you.

1761
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:36,380
I thought Australia was a small island until about a month ago.

1762
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:38,180
I'm just saying.

1763
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:40,000
Technically it is an island.

1764
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:41,820
It is an island.

1765
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:43,320
It's a small island.

1766
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:46,880
I thought you could get from one side to the other pretty quick.

1767
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:48,440
I didn't realize it was a whole thing.

1768
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:50,380
It was a whole concept island.

1769
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:51,500
No, that's New Zealand.

1770
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:52,720
Consonant?

1771
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:58,400
Can you actually name them all in biggest to largest continents or no?

1772
01:00:59,000 --> 01:00:59,800
Biggest to smallest?

1773
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:00,320
Go for it.

1774
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:01,640
I don't think I can even name them all.

1775
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:04,340
You can't name them all?

1776
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:05,220
No, you can do this.

1777
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:06,180
Biggest one.

1778
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:09,060
Definitely Africa.

1779
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:09,860
Wrong.

1780
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:10,400
Great try.

1781
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:11,340
Asia.

1782
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:15,940
Beautiful.

1783
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:17,380
Okay, there you go.

1784
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:19,740
Next one's Africa.

1785
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:21,320
We have Africa.

1786
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:24,900
Ellen, please use your chat to help you.

1787
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:26,820
Phone a chat right now.

1788
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:29,940
We have North America after that, right?

1789
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:30,220
Correct.

1790
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:33,950
Then we're going to South Africa.

1791
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:35,280
South America.

1792
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:38,280
South America is not a continent.

1793
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:38,940
You just said Africa.

1794
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:40,480
We're going to Australia.

1795
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:42,300
No, no.

1796
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:45,920
We're going to Europe.

1797
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:47,180
Yeah, yeah.

1798
01:01:47,420 --> 01:01:48,460
Come on.

1799
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:50,020
Then you're Australia.

1800
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:50,860
Nope.

1801
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:53,440
Great try.

1802
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:55,760
You know, there's like...

1803
01:01:57,120 --> 01:02:01,260
There's another country with Australia and it's called something else.

1804
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:05,100
Do you remember when you first discovered the Milky Way, Ellen?

1805
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:07,380
Yeah, like the chocolate bar.

1806
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:07,860
Yeah, it was great.

1807
01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:09,360
No, no, no.

1808
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,960
The Milky Way and the Big Dipper.

1809
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:12,620
Yeah, the chocolate bar.

1810
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:14,580
You learned about this a year ago.

1811
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:17,160
The Big Dipper is a chicken wing.

1812
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:18,220
Okay.

1813
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:20,660
I just met him.

1814
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:23,860
I just met Ellen now and I know he definitely did not retain any information.

1815
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:29,440
This isn't you.

1816
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:31,100
No, okay.

1817
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:31,500
One of them.

1818
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:32,560
Antarctica.

1819
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:33,220
Antarctica, guys.

1820
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:33,500
Come on.

1821
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:34,000
Yes.

1822
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:38,040
How many times did I look at you?

1823
01:02:39,620 --> 01:02:41,000
And then that's all of them.

1824
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:41,620
No more after that.

1825
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:43,260
No, Australia after that one.

1826
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:44,420
Australia after that one.

1827
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:46,060
New Zealand isn't a continent, you idiot.

1828
01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:46,620
No, it's not.

1829
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:52,340
There's another one near Australia?

1830
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:53,560
No.

1831
01:02:55,180 --> 01:02:55,580
What?

1832
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:58,280
It's because you keep naming Australia.

1833
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:02,640
And I was like, if you're going to name Australia, you've got to think about New Zealand and think about your answer.

1834
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:06,180
Wait, how is there another one?

1835
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:07,380
Where is it?

1836
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:09,360
You missed Antarctica.

1837
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:10,460
You missed that one.

1838
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:11,500
How is the other one now?

1839
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:12,060
You're good now.

1840
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:13,960
You're locked in.

1841
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:14,400
Look at you.

1842
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:15,120
You did it.

1843
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,740
I'm surprised you got Asia, to be honest, and Africa.

1844
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:19,860
Okay.

1845
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:20,940
I'll be real.

1846
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:25,400
I learned about continents a couple of years ago, but I thought Africa was a country until...

1847
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:28,280
You learned about continents a couple of years ago?

1848
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:31,440
What are they teaching you over there in the UK?

1849
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:34,720
I've explained this one before, but basically, hit me out.

1850
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:39,960
When you're in school, it gets to a certain level where people assume you know information.

1851
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:52,080
For example, I didn't know my vowels up until maybe three years ago, but until then, everyone assumes you know them, so no one tells me because they're like, well, obviously, he knows, right?

1852
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:53,540
Are you acting?

1853
01:03:54,220 --> 01:03:55,620
Is this like a persona?

1854
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:00,900
I'm always crying.

1855
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:07,920
I know what vowels are now.

1856
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:09,700
Is this a bit?

1857
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:12,100
A-I-O-U.

1858
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:13,380
A-I-O-U and sometimes Y.

1859
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:15,240
Sometimes Y, you know?

1860
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:17,360
Guys?

1861
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:21,540
So, anyone else on anything stupid?

1862
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:22,300
No, just me.

1863
01:04:23,380 --> 01:04:24,540
Every day I wake up.

1864
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:29,820
Oh, guys are ready.

1865
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:30,500
We're ready to go.

1866
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:34,100
I'm starting it, everyone.

1867
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:36,300
It's time to start the game.

1868
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:37,700
Good job, everyone.

1869
01:04:38,020 --> 01:04:38,760
We did it.

1870
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:41,000
Iced out.

1871
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:43,120
I'm so happy for everyone here.

1872
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:44,380
What are the vowels?

1873
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:48,600
A-I-O-U and sometimes Y on occasion.

1874
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:50,740
I only know that because of Wordle taught me that.

1875
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:52,920
You learned from Wordle?

1876
01:04:54,220 --> 01:04:58,740
You learned because Wordle became a streamer game and that's how you learned vowels?

1877
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:00,240
Yes.

1878
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:04,780
So, I learned how to spell humor as well.

1879
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:05,780
Oh.

1880
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:06,920
Yeah.

1881
01:05:07,540 --> 01:05:08,340
True story.

1882
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:13,200
You guys spelled the word humor weird.

1883
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:16,460
I pronounced it Hummer and it ended up on a livestream fails site.

1884
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:16,960
Oh.

1885
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:18,460
Yeah.

1886
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:19,280
Okay.

1887
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:23,060
Okay, team.

1888
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:23,440
Let's lock in.

1889
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:25,960
I need to up the game volume.

1890
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:31,240
Here we go.

1891
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:47,380
Let's do this, let's go.

1892
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:48,100
Here we go.

1893
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:48,100
You know,

1894
01:05:53,140 --> 01:05:53,800
last game.

1895
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:54,380
I was about to say that.

1896
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:55,320
First game is this.

1897
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:56,280
This is our time.

1898
01:05:58,340 --> 01:05:59,020
So, we're going to play this.

1899
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:01,160
And it's a while- How long do we have until the final game?

1900
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:01,220
You have 2 seconds.

1901
01:06:01,220 --> 01:06:03,760
I have no idea what this is.

1902
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:09,260
I think it's in Sudan, right?

1903
01:06:09,620 --> 01:06:10,180
Yes!

1904
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:11,540
I was gonna guess that.

1905
01:06:13,180 --> 01:06:17,700
Guys, we have one of the smarter chats.

1906
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:18,800
Good job, guys.

1907
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:25,020
I thought we were playing trivia.

1908
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:26,400
It is trivia.

1909
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:27,540
I'm dying?

1910
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:29,260
Oh, I know who's dying here.

1911
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:30,560
Me, for sure.

1912
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:32,800
Oh, I selected you.

1913
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:33,560
Let me tell you that.

1914
01:06:34,460 --> 01:06:35,720
Wait, you selected Wig too?

1915
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:38,900
If we select together, we both can get $100.

1916
01:06:41,020 --> 01:06:43,260
Guys, if we all select Wig, we can get $100.

1917
01:06:44,660 --> 01:06:45,580
He's in the cold.

1918
01:06:46,620 --> 01:06:47,860
I've never met you before.

1919
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:48,200
Hello.

1920
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:49,320
Have you seen this cat?

1921
01:06:50,060 --> 01:06:57,380
It has the eyes of a cat that has seen far too much and answers to the name Muffin.

1922
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:58,420
What the hell does that mean?

1923
01:06:58,540 --> 01:07:00,540
It has been missing for five years.

1924
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:03,060
What am I typing?

1925
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:04,440
Am I supposed to be doing something right now?

1926
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:09,620
No, you're just supposed to listen to it, Wig.

1927
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:10,740
Because it's a riddle.

1928
01:07:11,540 --> 01:07:12,220
Time's up.

1929
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:13,240
Oh, fuck me, man.

1930
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:18,920
Yeah, you were supposed to type it.

1931
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:20,620
Oh, dude.

1932
01:07:27,020 --> 01:07:29,160
Bro, I typed the whole thing out.

1933
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:30,180
And I deleted it.

1934
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:31,320
No, I deleted it too.

1935
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:33,600
$100, let's go.

1936
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:35,560
God, it's for joking sabotage.

1937
01:07:35,580 --> 01:07:36,000
That's insane.

1938
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:38,160
You just killed your own teammate, you sicko.

1939
01:07:39,980 --> 01:07:41,600
We're in the lead, guys.

1940
01:07:41,620 --> 01:07:42,080
We're in the lead.

1941
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:43,800
I got $100, though.

1942
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:46,540
Just more see-through.

1943
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:50,780
Get clean, and you just might steal someone else's life force and win the game.

1944
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:52,800
Oh, jeez.

1945
01:07:53,060 --> 01:07:53,980
The two Jacks.

1946
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:55,780
Yeah, both Jacks died.

1947
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,260
I guess we just hate Jacks.

1948
01:07:57,260 --> 01:07:58,000
Oh, wait, that's a...

1949
01:07:58,620 --> 01:07:59,940
Let's try another one.

1950
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:03,780
Where do Archie, Jughead, Betty, and Veronica...

1951
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:05,600
Oh, I know this without having to.

1952
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:06,200
What game is this?

1953
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:07,320
I actually read the...

1954
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:08,040
What video game is this?

1955
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:09,180
Who are these people?

1956
01:08:09,380 --> 01:08:10,060
What is that?

1957
01:08:10,060 --> 01:08:11,800
I actually read the Archie comics.

1958
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:15,300
I read this comic, but I actually forgot.

1959
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:18,600
This is a comic?

1960
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:19,280
Yeah.

1961
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:19,880
Yeah.

1962
01:08:21,340 --> 01:08:25,440
Archie, Jughead, Betty, Veronica, Reggie, Stilton, Moose.

1963
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:26,420
It's an American comic.

1964
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:27,800
Oh, is this about the Nemo's, man?

1965
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:30,040
I know the lore.

1966
01:08:30,340 --> 01:08:32,420
I didn't get that right.

1967
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:33,500
How did I even...

1968
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:34,000
What is this?

1969
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:36,400
What's chocolate?

1970
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:37,500
Wait, what is it?

1971
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:39,360
It's Pop's Cocktail Shop.

1972
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:43,160
Yeah, they always go to the Pop's.

1973
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:44,520
What the fuck?

1974
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:45,760
Ooh.

1975
01:08:47,620 --> 01:08:48,140
Huh?

1976
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:49,760
I'll kill the player with the lowest score.

1977
01:08:49,820 --> 01:08:50,180
Oh.

1978
01:08:50,820 --> 01:08:51,340
Oh.

1979
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:52,940
And you die instead.

1980
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:56,120
Think about statistics, everyone.

1981
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:57,120
Think about statistics.

1982
01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:00,460
Oh, I have to roll?

1983
01:09:00,860 --> 01:09:01,300
Alright.

1984
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:02,320
Roll!

1985
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:05,220
I can keep rolling.

1986
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:06,200
Roll!

1987
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:09,480
Roll!

1988
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:10,520
I'm rolling.

1989
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:11,200
I'm rolling.

1990
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:12,420
I'm rolling.

1991
01:09:12,620 --> 01:09:12,960
Roll!

1992
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:13,760
Oh, my God.

1993
01:09:13,780 --> 01:09:14,120
No, I'm sticking.

1994
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:15,140
Oh, my God.

1995
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:15,960
I'm rolling.

1996
01:09:18,180 --> 01:09:18,840
Oh, no!

1997
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:22,660
I had no choice.

1998
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:25,740
I had to get above, like, because if you're the lowest score, you lose anyway, right?

1999
01:09:25,780 --> 01:09:26,100
So...

2000
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:26,260
True.

2001
01:09:26,420 --> 01:09:26,860
True.

2002
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:27,360
Oh, that's true.

2003
01:09:27,780 --> 01:09:31,680
I had 18, so I was gonna die no matter what, so I either roll or die anyway.

2004
01:09:31,780 --> 01:09:32,080
Yeah.

2005
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:32,400
Yeah.

2006
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:32,880
True.

2007
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:34,040
You're a genius.

2008
01:09:35,060 --> 01:09:36,840
Mad bitches don't die, Hyun.

2009
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:37,320
Like...

2010
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:38,400
Yes, ma'am.

2011
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:40,000
We might be zero, but we're not...

2012
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,120
Oh, I don't know my cardinal directions, guys.

2013
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:42,580
This is...

2014
01:09:42,580 --> 01:09:42,980
I need help.

2015
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:45,460
I don't know, like...

2016
01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:45,880
What the fuck does this mean?

2017
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:48,000
I don't know my cardinal directions.

2018
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:48,380
I don't know.

2019
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:50,220
I'm gonna guess.

2020
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:52,560
Right?

2021
01:09:52,660 --> 01:09:53,920
I have no idea.

2022
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:54,960
I chose West, guys.

2023
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:55,200
West, guys.

2024
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:56,040
I chose West, guys.

2025
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:56,080
I chose West, guys.

2026
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:56,840
Clearly West.

2027
01:09:57,020 --> 01:09:57,360
Okay.

2028
01:09:57,620 --> 01:09:58,040
Lock it in.

2029
01:09:58,240 --> 01:09:58,860
Lock it in.

2030
01:09:59,300 --> 01:09:59,700
Okay.

2031
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:01,460
If he says West, I choose East.

2032
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:01,640
West.

2033
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:02,460
No, I chose West, too.

2034
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:03,760
You're an idiot.

2035
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:05,740
JK, I chose East.

2036
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:06,540
Just kidding.

2037
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:08,460
One of you guys are typing now?

2038
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:09,480
Not one of you guys?

2039
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:09,880
Not...

2040
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:11,140
No, sure, dude.

2041
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:15,520
Hey, Brazilian dragoons, thank you.

2042
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:17,680
Oh, God.

2043
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:19,240
Oh, loud.

2044
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:22,460
Any dragoons that wanna help me a little?

2045
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:23,100
Oh.

2046
01:10:25,140 --> 01:10:25,780
Go ahead, everyone.

2047
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:25,960
Go ahead.

2048
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:26,020
Go ahead.

2049
01:10:26,020 --> 01:10:26,040
Go ahead.

2050
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:27,660
I got the curse?

2051
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:28,300
Okay.

2052
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:28,800
Ooh.

2053
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:29,780
Bucket.

2054
01:10:29,780 --> 01:10:31,440
If each of us choose one of them...

2055
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:32,720
I'm choosing four, so don't choose four.

2056
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:33,400
I choose...

2057
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:34,040
I chose six.

2058
01:10:35,220 --> 01:10:36,520
We have to split it up.

2059
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:37,340
I locked in four.

2060
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:38,000
I locked in four.

2061
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:38,800
We have to split it up.

2062
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:39,880
Please have you guys save me.

2063
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:40,880
Please have you guys save me.

2064
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:42,200
Please have you save me.

2065
01:10:42,260 --> 01:10:43,120
I think you're fine.

2066
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:43,680
I think you're fine.

2067
01:10:43,780 --> 01:10:45,700
I totally didn't choose the one you're right above.

2068
01:10:45,820 --> 01:10:46,240
Bro, I mean, it's just all...

2069
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:47,720
It's just up to you.

2070
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,600
If you're a gamer, then you just...

2071
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:49,880
Oh.

2072
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:50,100
Yeah.

2073
01:10:50,260 --> 01:10:51,240
You literally...

2074
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:51,520
Oh.

2075
01:10:52,220 --> 01:10:52,580
Oh.

2076
01:10:53,220 --> 01:10:53,580
Oh.

2077
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:55,000
Oh, come on, dude.

2078
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:55,520
Bro.

2079
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:56,280
You guys...

2080
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:56,320
Childish...

2081
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:56,900
That was just one.

2082
01:10:57,340 --> 01:10:57,380
Bye.

2083
01:10:58,060 --> 01:10:58,580
TehZin.

2084
01:10:59,980 --> 01:11:02,340
TehZin's safe, TehZin.

2085
01:11:02,380 --> 01:11:04,760
Thank you so much.

2086
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:06,680
He's safe.

2087
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:08,080
The body grab...

2088
01:11:08,980 --> 01:11:09,580
Take it.

2089
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:10,400
Please do, TehZin.

2090
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:11,720
Oh, get down.

2091
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:13,420
That is instant.

2092
01:11:13,420 --> 01:11:14,020
I'll never forget this.

2093
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:17,040
She'll win for you.

2094
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:18,140
She'll always win.

2095
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:19,580
Oh, and you guys are all dead.

2096
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:21,560
No, you got me, bro.

2097
01:11:21,580 --> 01:11:21,780
Only the ladies are alive, though.

2098
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:22,560
The only was the human boss.

2099
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:23,100
You got this.

2100
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:23,660
Oh.

2101
01:11:23,660 --> 01:11:26,700
Oh, team women!

2102
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:27,680
Let's go!

2103
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:29,480
Let's go, girls!

2104
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:36,540
Okay, I actually don't know.

2105
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:43,340
I don't know what the capital city of Canada is.

2106
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:45,840
I don't pay attention.

2107
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:49,260
You're literally Canadian.

2108
01:11:49,900 --> 01:11:50,660
I know!

2109
01:11:50,980 --> 01:11:52,020
Yes, I am!

2110
01:11:53,660 --> 01:11:55,140
It's Montreal, guys!

2111
01:11:55,180 --> 01:11:57,040
I don't pay attention!

2112
01:11:57,640 --> 01:11:58,260
It's geography!

2113
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:01,580
Dude, how is it Oshawott?

2114
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:02,660
That doesn't even make sense.

2115
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:03,660
Oshawott.

2116
01:12:05,620 --> 01:12:08,060
That is Oshawott.

2117
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:15,940
What the fuck is that?

2118
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:20,460
Wait, I've got answers.

2119
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:23,520
No idea.

2120
01:12:23,660 --> 01:12:23,860
No idea, dude.

2121
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:28,440
If y'all got this one right, you're cheating.

2122
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:28,840
I don't care.

2123
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:29,240
That's insane.

2124
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:30,820
I was a theater kid.

2125
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:32,140
I was a theater kid in high school.

2126
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:33,320
You were a theater kid?

2127
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:35,600
I'm just passing you!

2128
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:37,560
Why is that corpsey?

2129
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:38,820
How did you all know that?

2130
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,560
I thought that just seemed like...

2131
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:41,300
We're cracked.

2132
01:12:41,540 --> 01:12:42,060
We're actually cracked.

2133
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:42,920
Because we killed the character off.

2134
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:43,940
I'm gonna come back and win.

2135
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:44,400
Yeah.

2136
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:46,280
Holy Christ.

2137
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:47,260
Wait, are you guys...

2138
01:12:47,260 --> 01:12:48,560
But we all got it right.

2139
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:49,560
Oh, we're...

2140
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:50,320
Yeah, it's you.

2141
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:50,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2142
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:52,480
Take as much money as you want.

2143
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:52,940
Take it all.

2144
01:12:53,020 --> 01:12:53,460
Take it all, kid.

2145
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:53,820
Take it all.

2146
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:57,340
Take the most money or the least money and you'll be sorry.

2147
01:12:57,740 --> 01:13:00,500
I guarantee you, ends and dies this time.

2148
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:02,420
Um...

2149
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:05,900
I put a really cool answer.

2150
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:07,980
Okay.

2151
01:13:09,420 --> 01:13:09,960
Okay.

2152
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:11,480
There we go.

2153
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:15,720
Oh, no.

2154
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:17,900
Oh, thank God.

2155
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:18,260
Okay.

2156
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,620
Oh, my God.

2157
01:13:20,740 --> 01:13:20,940
Oh, my God.

2158
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:22,400
Oh, my God.

2159
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:24,680
Wait.

2160
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:25,980
Gumi...

2161
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:26,120
Wait.

2162
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:26,460
Who's alive?

2163
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:27,360
Gumi and Doki.

2164
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:27,700
Me.

2165
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:28,180
Yeah.

2166
01:13:28,460 --> 01:13:29,440
Those are my teammates.

2167
01:13:30,220 --> 01:13:31,080
We both.

2168
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:32,660
Why are my teammates...

2169
01:13:32,660 --> 01:13:33,680
You put 499.

2170
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:34,560
I put 488.

2171
01:13:34,740 --> 01:13:35,220
Yeah.

2172
01:13:35,340 --> 01:13:37,240
I was like, okay, somebody put Spiderman.

2173
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:38,760
I am not my sponsor.

2174
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:39,740
I hope you have not my sponsor.

2175
01:13:40,220 --> 01:13:41,360
I hope you have not my sponsor.

2176
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:41,660
Ooh.

2177
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:44,200
I hope you've ruined my new...

2178
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:44,480
Oh, man.

2179
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:45,520
Gorgeous new breakfast bowl.

2180
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:46,680
I mean, that's...

2181
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:47,080
This is...

2182
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:47,720
This is...

2183
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:49,740
Well, it's definitely...

2184
01:13:49,740 --> 01:13:50,720
It's definitely this.

2185
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:51,180
It's one of your...

2186
01:13:51,180 --> 01:13:51,980
It's definitely this.

2187
01:13:53,580 --> 01:13:56,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's definitely strawberry or coconut.

2188
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:13,600
Yeah, but like the whole coconut is a seed apparently.

2189
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:15,720
Oh, that pissed me off, that pissed me off.

2190
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:29,940
We're both on the same team, Gumi, so it doesn't matter if either of us dies, we're both on the same team.

2191
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:33,680
I know, but something about going against you makes my mouth hot.

2192
01:14:33,860 --> 01:14:35,800
Gumi, please, we have to work together!

2193
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:39,360
Oh, you're dumb.

2194
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:39,980
Sorry.

2195
01:14:40,940 --> 01:14:43,480
Hey, why does it seem like I have a lot of dice?

2196
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:45,220
I feel like you died first though, Jag.

2197
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:49,780
I won the first challenge, so you get to kill me now.

2198
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:50,160
And that's all?

2199
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:51,740
Which you won, so what now?

2200
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:52,920
We've got the next game.

2201
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:53,780
Time to roll.

2202
01:14:55,460 --> 01:14:55,880
Oh.

2203
01:14:55,940 --> 01:14:57,040
Here we go.

2204
01:14:57,620 --> 01:14:58,040
Oh!

2205
01:14:58,600 --> 01:14:59,020
No!

2206
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:00,060
The dice don't lie.

2207
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:00,420
No!

2208
01:15:00,860 --> 01:15:02,560
Wait, do we win in a matter of rounds?

2209
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:05,020
Wait, why did they kill you?

2210
01:15:05,020 --> 01:15:06,940
I thought they would kill me, not gonna lie.

2211
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:09,280
What the heck's going on here?

2212
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:11,080
I thought I was gonna die.

2213
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:15,240
I was ready to kill you, I was doing it.

2214
01:15:18,260 --> 01:15:19,560
That was rough, that was rough.

2215
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:24,240
Guys, I think I might die just from the fast trivia.

2216
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:27,560
Is that the end of the game?

2217
01:15:27,660 --> 01:15:28,980
No, you have to do the fast trivia.

2218
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:30,120
I'm basically against everybody.

2219
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:31,540
Oh, no.

2220
01:15:31,940 --> 01:15:32,320
Dude!

2221
01:15:32,780 --> 01:15:33,100
This is hard.

2222
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:37,260
Wait, I can't see the answers.

2223
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:37,720
Wait, what?

2224
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:39,820
Oh, no, because she only gets this.

2225
01:15:40,420 --> 01:15:41,300
Which one is this?

2226
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:44,320
Oh, I know this.

2227
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:46,120
I don't know this.

2228
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:47,040
What do you mean?

2229
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:48,140
I don't even know how to answer this.

2230
01:15:48,380 --> 01:15:49,420
Oh, you should have done it.

2231
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:49,780
Fuck.

2232
01:15:52,620 --> 01:15:53,380
Oh, okay.

2233
01:15:54,980 --> 01:15:56,480
You're on your way to escaping.

2234
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:59,940
But get this, all ghosts get to play, too.

2235
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:00,840
Oh!

2236
01:16:01,540 --> 01:16:01,980
Yes.

2237
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:04,080
Justin's for Jax.

2238
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:04,780
What's going on here?

2239
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:06,840
Another Jax open.

2240
01:16:06,860 --> 01:16:08,460
Here's everyone's next question.

2241
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:11,960
And ghosts get a third choice to help them catch up to you.

2242
01:16:11,980 --> 01:16:12,680
Ginger root.

2243
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:13,300
Ginger root.

2244
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:13,760
It's ginger.

2245
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:15,480
What is it?

2246
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:16,500
Oh, wait.

2247
01:16:16,540 --> 01:16:16,660
Shoot.

2248
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:17,540
Everyone's playing now.

2249
01:16:17,540 --> 01:16:18,460
I'm trying to help my sister.

2250
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:20,800
I don't know.

2251
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Is button not swash?

2252
01:16:23,020 --> 01:16:24,040
Ginger, ginger, ginger.

2253
01:16:24,540 --> 01:16:26,080
But I chose button not swash.

2254
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:27,480
Oh, no.

2255
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:28,180
I might die.

2256
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:31,200
Oh, I know this.

2257
01:16:31,460 --> 01:16:32,980
I know this one, too.

2258
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:33,840
Locked in.

2259
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:34,300
Locked in.

2260
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:34,720
Locked in.

2261
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:35,820
Locked in.

2262
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:36,900
Very good.

2263
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:37,440
I know this.

2264
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:39,840
I don't like cats like that.

2265
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:40,380
What's going on?

2266
01:16:40,460 --> 01:16:40,960
Give me dog brain.

2267
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:42,240
Russian boy, bro.

2268
01:16:42,420 --> 01:16:43,580
What the dog brain?

2269
01:16:43,660 --> 01:16:44,080
Oh, God.

2270
01:16:44,220 --> 01:16:44,720
Oh, God.

2271
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:46,100
Everybody's catching up.

2272
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:47,940
Dog brain for the round table.

2273
01:16:48,660 --> 01:16:49,100
Oh.

2274
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:50,960
Sir Malfoy.

2275
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:53,180
Sir Malfoy.

2276
01:16:53,220 --> 01:16:53,900
I don't know.

2277
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:54,540
Oh, my God.

2278
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:55,640
Oh, I read it.

2279
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:59,720
I watch Monty Python.

2280
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:00,380
I know this.

2281
01:17:01,220 --> 01:17:02,040
We're zooming.

2282
01:17:03,060 --> 01:17:03,940
Uh-oh.

2283
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:05,440
Uh-oh.

2284
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:06,260
Oh, no.

2285
01:17:06,260 --> 01:17:08,320
I don't know who in this team is catching up.

2286
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:09,660
Oh, my God.

2287
01:17:10,980 --> 01:17:12,580
Do I still win my money if I die?

2288
01:17:13,020 --> 01:17:14,100
Human blood types.

2289
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:16,420
What the fuck?

2290
01:17:17,020 --> 01:17:17,460
AC+.

2291
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:20,940
Guys, I'm going to be honest.

2292
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:22,480
I don't even know if this is correct.

2293
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:22,680
Me neither.

2294
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:24,300
I don't know.

2295
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:25,520
Wait.

2296
01:17:25,660 --> 01:17:26,020
I forgot.

2297
01:17:26,380 --> 01:17:27,340
I wrote A.

2298
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:28,580
Why did I put A?

2299
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:29,680
Yes.

2300
01:17:29,820 --> 01:17:30,300
I forgot.

2301
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:33,720
I forgot to uncheck it.

2302
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:35,400
I wrote double A.

2303
01:17:42,420 --> 01:17:47,560
If it's not green, I'm actually just running through my wall as fast as I can because that doesn't make any sense.

2304
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:48,140
Green letters.

2305
01:17:48,420 --> 01:17:49,400
No way.

2306
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:50,540
Oh, no.

2307
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:52,480
This game is so trolled.

2308
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:53,700
What is that?

2309
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,300
I'm too dumb for this.

2310
01:17:59,540 --> 01:17:59,840
Oh, I know this.

2311
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:00,240
I know this.

2312
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:01,080
I know this one too.

2313
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:01,320
Easy.

2314
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:01,680
Wait.

2315
01:18:01,740 --> 01:18:02,240
I don't know this.

2316
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:03,140
What?

2317
01:18:03,460 --> 01:18:05,460
I don't know this either.

2318
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:06,300
It's Rhode Island or Rhodes.

2319
01:18:06,540 --> 01:18:06,920
Rhodes.

2320
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:07,540
Not Rhodes.

2321
01:18:07,580 --> 01:18:07,880
Not Rhodes.

2322
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:08,240
Go.

2323
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:08,520
Go.

2324
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:08,600
Go.

2325
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:08,980
Okay.

2326
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:10,420
I guessed the wrong one.

2327
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:11,280
I guessed the wrong one.

2328
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:11,880
It's two.

2329
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:12,900
It's two.

2330
01:18:13,140 --> 01:18:13,520
Crazy.

2331
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:15,120
Oh, I'm back.

2332
01:18:15,180 --> 01:18:16,120
I'm back, baby.

2333
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:18,380
One of you win, please.

2334
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:20,980
Oh, I don't know this.

2335
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:24,020
Oh, my God.

2336
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:25,020
This is so hard.

2337
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:25,960
This is nerve-wracking.

2338
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:27,240
Who's Alexander?

2339
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:29,020
Dude, I don't know.

2340
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:29,560
Hamilton.

2341
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:30,180
Hamilton.

2342
01:18:30,740 --> 01:18:31,700
Alexander Hamilton.

2343
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:33,500
Oh, thank God.

2344
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:36,760
Wait.

2345
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:37,500
LM, go.

2346
01:18:37,620 --> 01:18:38,020
LM, go.

2347
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:38,880
Oh, my God.

2348
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:39,880
This will slow you down.

2349
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:43,440
If you want to break through that barrier, you'll need a perfect answer to this question.

2350
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:44,280
Oh, what?

2351
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:45,880
Oh, shit.

2352
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:46,800
What is this?

2353
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:48,100
Oh, fuck.

2354
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:50,140
I don't freaking know, bro.

2355
01:18:56,460 --> 01:18:56,900
Okay.

2356
01:18:57,420 --> 01:18:57,860
It's...

2357
01:18:57,860 --> 01:18:58,240
No.

2358
01:18:58,580 --> 01:19:00,860
Dude, why can't Boy Scouts learn suing?

2359
01:19:01,060 --> 01:19:02,980
That seems like an important skill.

2360
01:19:04,220 --> 01:19:05,000
Why don't you pick two answers?

2361
01:19:05,220 --> 01:19:05,760
No, no, no.

2362
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:06,200
No.

2363
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:07,440
Wait.

2364
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:07,820
Ten's in.

2365
01:19:07,820 --> 01:19:08,160
Ten's in.

2366
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:08,960
Oh, my God.

2367
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:09,400
I'm a goose.

2368
01:19:10,780 --> 01:19:11,340
Hold on.

2369
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:11,720
Watch this.

2370
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:14,340
Watch this.

2371
01:19:14,380 --> 01:19:14,800
This is crazy.

2372
01:19:15,140 --> 01:19:15,960
What is this?

2373
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:17,420
Watch this.

2374
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:18,200
This is so crazy.

2375
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:18,500
Watch this.

2376
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:18,540
I'm in here.

2377
01:19:18,540 --> 01:19:19,880
If you flex like this around, this is crazy.

2378
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:22,620
Oh, my God.

2379
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:23,760
Oh, my God.

2380
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:24,080
I only picked one.

2381
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:24,520
No.

2382
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:25,720
There's all of us in here.

2383
01:19:26,020 --> 01:19:26,400
All of us.

2384
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:27,640
I'm trying.

2385
01:19:27,740 --> 01:19:28,160
I'm trying.

2386
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:28,740
I'm trying.

2387
01:19:29,220 --> 01:19:29,800
Oh, my God.

2388
01:19:30,060 --> 01:19:30,580
Oh, my God.

2389
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:31,120
Oh, my God.

2390
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:36,160
Oh, my God.

2391
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:36,760
Oh, my God.

2392
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:37,600
What the fuck is this scam?

2393
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:37,920
I'm trying.

2394
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:38,040
It's almost done.

2395
01:19:40,660 --> 01:19:41,720
It kind of looked like one.

2396
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:42,140
No.

2397
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:42,720
Go, go.

2398
01:19:42,900 --> 01:19:43,260
Go, go.

2399
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:44,000
Go.

2400
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:44,940
You got it.

2401
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:47,320
Who was that?

2402
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:47,860
I got it.

2403
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:48,440
You got it.

2404
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:50,500
Who was that?

2405
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:50,940
I got to go down.

2406
01:19:51,180 --> 01:19:51,860
I got in.

2407
01:19:51,980 --> 01:19:52,560
What the frick is that?

2408
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:53,100
Wait.

2409
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:53,500
Who won?

2410
01:19:53,620 --> 01:19:53,960
Who won?

2411
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:54,160
Who won?

2412
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:54,860
No.

2413
01:19:54,860 --> 01:19:54,960
No.

2414
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:55,200
No.

2415
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:55,500
It wasn't me.

2416
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:56,040
I'm funny.

2417
01:19:56,580 --> 01:19:56,940
No.

2418
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,440
I'm so confused!

2419
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:10,000
I don't even know what the right answer was!

2420
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:13,520
I got the most points, it's alright.

2421
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:15,860
It's all about the scores.

2422
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:17,060
Where's my team?

2423
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:21,320
I dropped out of community college.

2424
01:20:22,220 --> 01:20:23,460
I'm not made for this.

2425
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:29,620
Jack, what are you doing out here?

2426
01:20:30,820 --> 01:20:32,620
Wait, VIP won again?

2427
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:34,220
What are the odds?

2428
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:37,060
Hey, I sent someone else to the VIP.

2429
01:20:39,820 --> 01:20:41,180
It's literally rigged.

2430
01:20:41,220 --> 01:20:41,820
I hate school.

2431
01:20:42,860 --> 01:20:44,640
We're on the same team, guys!

2432
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,000
We're on the same team!

2433
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:49,760
I can't believe I typed that whole thing out just to get it deleted.

2434
01:20:51,340 --> 01:20:54,080
That was my highlight of the day.

2435
01:20:54,380 --> 01:20:56,760
I can't believe you listened to me, Wig.

2436
01:20:56,940 --> 01:20:58,340
I don't know why I do everything.

2437
01:20:58,980 --> 01:21:03,040
The fact that you actually deleted it.

2438
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:04,080
Why would you delete that?

2439
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:06,120
Why didn't you delete it?

2440
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:07,660
I was so stressed.

2441
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:13,340
I was saying I couldn't type it because I didn't have the option to type.

2442
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:15,660
I think you were just listening to me going, Yeah, I can't do it either.

2443
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:17,340
You're an idiot.

2444
01:21:19,620 --> 01:21:22,260
Anything school-wise stresses me out.

2445
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:23,680
Get me off this fucking thing.

2446
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:25,640
Oh my god.

2447
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:28,580
One last game, guys.

2448
01:21:28,700 --> 01:21:29,960
One last game.

2449
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:31,660
One last game.

2450
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:34,500
Updates on the rankings?

2451
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:35,440
Like, are we...

2452
01:21:36,020 --> 01:21:36,760
What's the rankings?

2453
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:39,140
Maybe look at Twitch Rivals?

2454
01:21:39,460 --> 01:21:40,780
We have to look at the Twitch Rivals.

2455
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:43,940
But we're not winning that hard either.

2456
01:21:44,260 --> 01:21:46,820
I feel like everyone's been doing pretty good.

2457
01:21:46,980 --> 01:21:47,900
So I feel like it's going to be pretty even.

2458
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:49,740
Yeah, I'm not sure.

2459
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:51,320
I feel like there's no clear winner yet.

2460
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:52,660
Unless you guys have been dominating.

2461
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:54,300
Well, I think our team has been winning a lot.

2462
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:55,300
I think.

2463
01:21:55,300 --> 01:21:55,860
Maybe?

2464
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:56,820
I don't know.

2465
01:21:57,260 --> 01:21:58,940
Doki Bird shows up to take my wins away.

2466
01:22:00,660 --> 01:22:01,460
Every game.

2467
01:22:01,940 --> 01:22:04,640
Every single game I play, she appears to win.

2468
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:06,340
It's crazy, I tell you.

2469
01:22:06,580 --> 01:22:08,420
Maybe we should be on my team instead.

2470
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:10,980
That's a good idea.

2471
01:22:11,140 --> 01:22:11,940
We had a title to protect, man.

2472
01:22:11,980 --> 01:22:13,460
We had a title to protect and we're losing it now.

2473
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:15,220
We won the last trivia night, man.

2474
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:18,020
Yeah, well, who got the least amount of points in Quiplash?

2475
01:22:18,380 --> 01:22:18,780
Me.

2476
01:22:20,780 --> 01:22:21,600
Oh, it was Wig.

2477
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:22,060
Yeah, there you go.

2478
01:22:22,060 --> 01:22:23,240
That cost us, man.

2479
01:22:23,620 --> 01:22:24,640
That cost us.

2480
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:25,580
That was a big penalty.

2481
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:28,340
No, you got full Quiplash because of that.

2482
01:22:28,460 --> 01:22:29,120
Like, plus 6,000.

2483
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:31,660
Yeah, I think it's all of us added together, right?

2484
01:22:31,740 --> 01:22:33,220
Isn't it like the collective points?

2485
01:22:33,780 --> 01:22:34,880
Well, I don't know.

2486
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:35,940
I don't know.

2487
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:36,300
I don't know.

2488
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:36,940
I mean...

2489
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:38,380
I don't know.

2490
01:22:38,860 --> 01:22:41,600
Well, we're against Ape's team last, so like, we're chilling, right?

2491
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:42,600
Surely, right?

2492
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:42,980
Surely.

2493
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:44,640
I mean, it's Mafia, so...

2494
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:46,980
Oh, we're against MiYong's team last.

2495
01:22:46,980 --> 01:22:48,880
Yeah, we got MiYong's team in the final bout.

2496
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:50,500
Okay, that's going to be an easy win, right?

2497
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:52,600
Damn, you're calling your team easy?

2498
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:53,200
You say like that.

2499
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:56,860
In the specific game that's coming up, Elem's a master of.

2500
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:57,520
Oh, yeah.

2501
01:22:57,700 --> 01:23:01,220
Wait, Elem gets killed first every time in like Mafia games.

2502
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:03,640
Where's Mafia A again, guys?

2503
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:04,240
Oh, yeah.

2504
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,480
We gotta switch, guys.

2505
01:23:05,540 --> 01:23:05,920
Well, actually...

2506
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:10,720
Dude, Elem's an expert at this upcoming game, and he's just going to pipiga clap him.

2507
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:11,140
You know what I mean?

2508
01:23:11,140 --> 01:23:11,500
Yeah.

2509
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:12,160
This is my game.

2510
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:12,580
This is my one.

2511
01:23:12,940 --> 01:23:13,600
Sorry, guys.

2512
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:13,960
We're taking over.

2513
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:14,780
It's GG.

2514
01:23:15,260 --> 01:23:15,380
It's GG.

2515
01:23:15,380 --> 01:23:15,500
It's GG.

2516
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:16,280
It's GG.

2517
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:22,200
It's GG.

2518
01:23:25,260 --> 01:23:27,100
We're all doing our fair share.

2519
01:23:28,700 --> 01:23:29,780
Except for Tenzin.

2520
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:31,900
No, no, no, no, no.

2521
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:32,720
Tenzin might go.

2522
01:23:33,220 --> 01:23:33,660
Yeah.

2523
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:35,180
I didn't die first.

2524
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:36,080
Oh.

2525
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:37,080
I didn't...

2526
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:41,240
Well, I tied to die first, so...

2527
01:23:42,420 --> 01:23:43,580
I didn't put that all in.

2528
01:23:43,660 --> 01:23:43,840
You know what?

2529
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:44,180
I'm absolved.

2530
01:23:44,340 --> 01:23:46,220
There was another Jack who's not doing so great.

2531
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:47,160
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2532
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:47,500
Damn.

2533
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:49,180
Wait, Peter's...

2534
01:23:49,180 --> 01:23:49,640
Wait, Peter's...

2535
01:23:50,340 --> 01:23:51,860
Peter's team's last, by the way.

2536
01:23:51,900 --> 01:23:52,180
What?

2537
01:23:52,180 --> 01:23:53,380
They spelled green wrong.

2538
01:23:53,380 --> 01:23:54,320
Dude, that's what I'm saying nicely.

2539
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:55,200
It's because they spelled it wrong.

2540
01:23:55,460 --> 01:23:56,980
How is green not a lettuce?

2541
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:58,080
It's literally green.

2542
01:23:58,260 --> 01:23:58,660
Yeah.

2543
01:23:58,660 --> 01:23:59,160
Is it a green?

2544
01:23:59,400 --> 01:23:59,800
Yeah.

2545
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:00,560
That's true.

2546
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:01,560
That's literally green.

2547
01:24:01,740 --> 01:24:02,700
That's true.

2548
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:07,560
I haven't involved in over a video game in like two years, but I think those just really stressed me out.

2549
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:07,980
Made me mad.

2550
01:24:08,020 --> 01:24:08,600
I can't believe that.

2551
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:08,800
Yeah.

2552
01:24:08,860 --> 01:24:11,760
The ending for Trivia Murder Party is always the hardest part.

2553
01:24:12,660 --> 01:24:14,300
We need a video game.

2554
01:24:14,380 --> 01:24:15,500
We need video game trivia.

2555
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:16,680
That would get...

2556
01:24:16,680 --> 01:24:17,120
Ooh.

2557
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:17,340
Yeah.

2558
01:24:17,340 --> 01:24:17,880
That would be fun.

2559
01:24:19,180 --> 01:24:20,000
Trivia for idiots.

2560
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:20,960
That's like perfect.

2561
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:20,980
Yeah.

2562
01:24:20,980 --> 01:24:22,840
We need to put some Minecraft trivia in there and see what happens.

2563
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:23,880
Hey, what's up?

2564
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:24,240
Hey, what up, man?

2565
01:24:24,240 --> 01:24:25,400
What's up, gamers?

2566
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:27,380
Switch it up, guys.

2567
01:24:27,660 --> 01:24:27,700
Oh, wait.

2568
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:28,780
I was in the lobby B.

2569
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:30,000
Are we going down?

2570
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:30,220
Yeah.

2571
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:30,600
We're going down.

2572
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:31,600
See you later, team.

2573
01:24:31,700 --> 01:24:31,920
Bye.

2574
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:32,840
Bye, guys.

2575
01:24:33,140 --> 01:24:33,540
See you later.

2576
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:33,880
Bye.

2577
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:34,160
Bye.

2578
01:24:34,460 --> 01:24:35,520
See you guys later.

2579
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:37,880
What?

2580
01:24:38,140 --> 01:24:38,160
Hello.

2581
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:39,720
You can get Nando sauce in the US?

2582
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:40,680
Hello.

2583
01:24:40,700 --> 01:24:42,240
Nando sauce in the US?

2584
01:24:42,620 --> 01:24:43,420
What the fuck?

2585
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:45,220
Oh, hey, guys.

2586
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:45,920
Yeah.

2587
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:47,860
Apparently Walmart carries Nando sauce.

2588
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:49,960
Who won in your lobby?

2589
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:52,080
I did.

2590
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:52,840
Oh.

2591
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:53,940
Oh.

2592
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:56,200
Oh, you guys might be third, then.

2593
01:24:56,840 --> 01:24:57,260
No.

2594
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:58,160
Let me just like...

2595
01:24:58,160 --> 01:25:00,080
The last question was so fucking troll.

2596
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:03,620
It was like, what's the key on the bottom of a QWERTY keyboard?

2597
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:05,100
So everyone just looked at their keyboards.

2598
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:09,520
You know what's the best part?

2599
01:25:09,700 --> 01:25:11,200
Someone fucking got it wrong.

2600
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:15,860
Who?

2601
01:25:16,020 --> 01:25:16,520
Who got it wrong?

2602
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:16,860
Who was it?

2603
01:25:16,860 --> 01:25:17,480
Call them out.

2604
01:25:17,740 --> 01:25:18,420
Who was it?

2605
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:20,500
I won't say, but they're very short.

2606
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:20,940
I don't know.

2607
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:22,980
I'm not in this call.

2608
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:26,040
Talking.

2609
01:25:26,240 --> 01:25:26,820
You got it wrong.

2610
01:25:27,220 --> 01:25:27,700
I'm not going to say who.

2611
01:25:27,700 --> 01:25:27,980
I'm not going to say who.

2612
01:25:27,980 --> 01:25:28,800
Not in this call, that's it.

2613
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:32,960
But like, you might not be able to see them over like a standard kitchen counter top.

2614
01:25:33,220 --> 01:25:33,680
You know what I mean?

2615
01:25:34,260 --> 01:25:34,620
Damn.

2616
01:25:34,940 --> 01:25:35,300
Damn.

2617
01:25:35,300 --> 01:25:39,200
I think the type that I require is uppies in order to engage in conversation.

2618
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:42,200
Yvonne?

2619
01:25:42,220 --> 01:25:43,680
Like they have a collapsible tool that...

2620
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:43,880
Yep.

2621
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:46,500
How'd you know?

2622
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:47,740
How the fuck did you know?

2623
01:25:47,820 --> 01:25:48,300
That's crazy.

2624
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:49,120
Who in the chat?

2625
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:50,340
I'm in chat.

2626
01:25:50,340 --> 01:25:50,480
Yes, man.

2627
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:51,820
All but Yvonne law!

2628
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:55,840
No, no man, like I feel like I didn't really give enough hints.

2629
01:25:55,980 --> 01:25:56,760
Yeah, not at all.

2630
01:25:57,100 --> 01:25:57,320
Oh really!

2631
01:25:57,320 --> 01:25:59,060
You painted a good picture there, I think?

2632
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:03,660
It could have been Ape honestly.

2633
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:05,040
Whoa!

2634
01:26:05,140 --> 01:26:06,320
Oh, I thought he spit...

2635
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:06,360
Whoa!

2636
01:26:07,540 --> 01:26:09,360
Let me just tell Ape something real quick.

2637
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:10,540
Okay.

2638
01:26:10,580 --> 01:26:10,700
Whoa!

2639
01:26:11,580 --> 01:26:12,240
Wait, wait.

2640
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:13,880
Banned from every collab.

2641
01:26:21,850 --> 01:26:22,610
All right.

2642
01:26:24,030 --> 01:26:24,470
Right...

2643
01:26:24,470 --> 01:26:25,530
So, how do you play gamble?

2644
01:26:25,550 --> 01:26:26,210
I think I pushed the button.

2645
01:26:26,910 --> 01:26:28,810
Dude, he ratted me out.

2646
01:26:28,930 --> 01:26:29,290
That's crazy.

2647
01:26:30,870 --> 01:26:32,030
He ratted me out.

2648
01:26:32,550 --> 01:26:33,450
My own teammate.

2649
01:26:33,570 --> 01:26:34,430
I'm going to grief him this game.

2650
01:26:37,430 --> 01:26:38,790
Jaqen, you talking shit?

2651
01:26:39,150 --> 01:26:40,510
Of course not.

2652
01:26:40,710 --> 01:26:41,550
You little bitch.

2653
01:26:42,290 --> 01:26:43,730
You're my goat.

2654
01:26:45,670 --> 01:26:47,210
Oh, I thought I was your goat.

2655
01:26:47,930 --> 01:26:48,470
Oh, no.

2656
01:26:48,510 --> 01:26:49,570
He's my silver goat.

2657
01:26:49,950 --> 01:26:51,290
Jaqen's kind of like a goat slut.

2658
01:26:51,430 --> 01:26:52,510
He just throws that word around.

2659
01:26:52,510 --> 01:26:53,730
What the hell?

2660
01:26:53,850 --> 01:26:54,970
I got multiple goats.

2661
01:26:56,010 --> 01:26:56,750
Jaqen, listen.

2662
01:26:58,390 --> 01:26:59,150
You're dead to me.

2663
01:26:59,990 --> 01:27:01,350
You don't mean that, do you?

2664
01:27:01,710 --> 01:27:03,250
Try not getting 8th for once.

2665
01:27:07,010 --> 01:27:08,370
You don't mean that, do you?

2666
01:27:08,690 --> 01:27:09,590
Doki, you know what's crazy?

2667
01:27:10,070 --> 01:27:12,550
All three games Jaqen's played, he's gotten the lowest points.

2668
01:27:13,110 --> 01:27:13,510
Damn!

2669
01:27:14,870 --> 01:27:16,490
Wait, whose team is he in?

2670
01:27:17,550 --> 01:27:18,290
Wait, Peter.

2671
01:27:18,490 --> 01:27:19,230
You're in my lobby.

2672
01:27:22,510 --> 01:27:22,950
Damn!

2673
01:27:23,530 --> 01:27:25,390
Is this why Peter's last place?

2674
01:27:26,730 --> 01:27:29,110
Jaqen, you've been last place first game and second game.

2675
01:27:29,210 --> 01:27:30,510
This trivia murder party?

2676
01:27:30,590 --> 01:27:31,570
This is your time to shine.

2677
01:27:31,710 --> 01:27:33,070
Literally gets eliminated first.

2678
01:27:33,890 --> 01:27:34,350
Shit!

2679
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:37,430
Yeah, Peter's team is last place.

2680
01:27:39,070 --> 01:27:40,410
How did you guys see that?

2681
01:27:40,650 --> 01:27:42,650
Because they did an overall standings.

2682
01:27:44,550 --> 01:27:45,770
I'm at the bottom right now?

2683
01:27:46,110 --> 01:27:48,630
Well, they didn't count this game yet.

2684
01:27:48,670 --> 01:27:49,890
They didn't count the third game yet.

2685
01:27:49,890 --> 01:27:52,290
But after two games, Peter's team was last.

2686
01:27:52,610 --> 01:27:54,710
Jaqen, this is a team effort.

2687
01:27:54,850 --> 01:27:56,370
But let's just say you're bringing down the team.

2688
01:27:57,830 --> 01:28:00,370
I love family game night, guys.

2689
01:28:00,590 --> 01:28:00,690
No, no, no.

2690
01:28:01,030 --> 01:28:02,930
Nah, I can't.

2691
01:28:03,370 --> 01:28:04,310
Say it, say it.

2692
01:28:04,630 --> 01:28:06,570
You grieved the first game.

2693
01:28:06,990 --> 01:28:08,430
You grieved the first game.

2694
01:28:08,590 --> 01:28:09,650
Because you got too greedy.

2695
01:28:11,110 --> 01:28:12,490
But didn't Peter win?

2696
01:28:13,410 --> 01:28:13,850
Yeah.

2697
01:28:14,690 --> 01:28:16,710
But you got too greedy so everything was on fire.

2698
01:28:17,330 --> 01:28:18,770
Peter had the most points.

2699
01:28:19,890 --> 01:28:21,050
Yeah, I had the most points on my team.

2700
01:28:21,350 --> 01:28:22,470
Is that not the point of the game?

2701
01:28:22,590 --> 01:28:23,830
Is that not the point of the game?

2702
01:28:24,130 --> 01:28:27,770
But Jaqen, my team also gained a lot of points and we're in the same family.

2703
01:28:27,950 --> 01:28:28,270
Yeah.

2704
01:28:28,310 --> 01:28:31,470
I actually got less points than Gumi.

2705
01:28:31,570 --> 01:28:33,970
Gumi was greedier than I was and yet their team still won.

2706
01:28:34,070 --> 01:28:34,910
So Jaqen, what's your...

2707
01:28:37,650 --> 01:28:40,630
Wait, didn't Jaqen stop Peter when Peter got too greedy?

2708
01:28:41,070 --> 01:28:44,110
Didn't you actually try to stop him?

2709
01:28:44,290 --> 01:28:48,430
Yeah, Jaqen, you could have actually allowed me to score more points for my team and yet you stopped me.

2710
01:28:48,430 --> 01:28:50,490
I was trying but you got too greedy.

2711
01:28:50,970 --> 01:28:53,990
But isn't being greedy the whole point in letting your family win?

2712
01:28:54,790 --> 01:28:55,610
Yeah, that's the point.

2713
01:28:55,610 --> 01:28:57,110
No, if you get too greedy...

2714
01:28:57,730 --> 01:28:58,890
It's a shared money.

2715
01:28:59,210 --> 01:29:01,690
We should have survived the night but we didn't.

2716
01:29:02,710 --> 01:29:03,270
That's true.

2717
01:29:03,590 --> 01:29:05,810
I don't think they expected us to survive the night to be fair.

2718
01:29:05,810 --> 01:29:07,410
Yeah, we all died because people got greedy.

2719
01:29:07,770 --> 01:29:09,290
But even, like, no one won.

2720
01:29:09,750 --> 01:29:14,250
Wait, Jaqen, I don't think you actually understand the rules of the first game if you think that you're not supposed to be greedy.

2721
01:29:14,350 --> 01:29:16,510
Like, you're stopping me from winning us the game.

2722
01:29:16,510 --> 01:29:18,310
No, but you got too greedy.

2723
01:29:18,650 --> 01:29:20,690
No, listen, Goomy was greedier than I was.

2724
01:29:20,790 --> 01:29:22,030
Like, she literally studied the game.

2725
01:29:22,290 --> 01:29:22,710
I was not.

2726
01:29:22,970 --> 01:29:23,830
Wait, wait, wait.

2727
01:29:23,930 --> 01:29:24,570
I was not.

2728
01:29:24,670 --> 01:29:25,490
Goomy, Goomy, Goomy.

2729
01:29:25,590 --> 01:29:29,970
We were both setting the same amount of fires but your team let her through because you understood how to play the game.

2730
01:29:29,970 --> 01:29:31,090
No, I flooded the basement once.

2731
01:29:31,390 --> 01:29:34,970
No, you also set two fires.

2732
01:29:35,090 --> 01:29:35,850
I remember when I shit.

2733
01:29:36,050 --> 01:29:37,970
At least, Peter, Peter.

2734
01:29:38,070 --> 01:29:38,990
You guys are third now.

2735
01:29:39,110 --> 01:29:39,650
Ellum's last.

2736
01:29:40,770 --> 01:29:44,230
Your win for the third game got you the third place.

2737
01:29:44,370 --> 01:29:45,810
Okay, I'm gonna cook in this one.

2738
01:29:46,510 --> 01:29:47,090
Goomy, Goomy, Goomy.

2739
01:29:47,290 --> 01:29:51,030
If you lose this game, you're still first, right?

2740
01:29:51,110 --> 01:29:52,370
Like, it doesn't affect the standings for you.

2741
01:29:52,470 --> 01:29:53,530
But for me, right?

2742
01:29:54,110 --> 01:29:56,470
I could win over Ellum, so just come on.

2743
01:29:57,130 --> 01:29:58,570
We'll do anything, Goomy.

2744
01:29:58,690 --> 01:29:59,330
Just let us know first.

2745
01:30:00,390 --> 01:30:02,930
Listen, I don't even know what the next game is.

2746
01:30:03,070 --> 01:30:03,790
I don't know either.

2747
01:30:03,910 --> 01:30:04,750
We're in the spaceship.

2748
01:30:04,990 --> 01:30:07,110
It's like Aliens and Hunters or some shit.

2749
01:30:09,150 --> 01:30:10,750
Oh, Goomy, you're so good at that.

2750
01:30:11,770 --> 01:30:13,030
Oh, the code is up.

2751
01:30:13,030 --> 01:30:13,790
Yeah.

2752
01:30:14,810 --> 01:30:16,510
Wait, it's up?

2753
01:30:16,790 --> 01:30:17,030
Yeah.

2754
01:30:19,450 --> 01:30:20,030
It's fine.

2755
01:30:20,090 --> 01:30:20,910
We've got this team.

2756
01:30:21,230 --> 01:30:22,530
Yeah, I believe in us.

2757
01:30:22,570 --> 01:30:25,570
Maybe losing in points, but you know, we're doing great in team spirit.

2758
01:30:27,770 --> 01:30:31,250
Your teammate is an alien to not really go for them?

2759
01:30:31,710 --> 01:30:32,710
Am I right about that?

2760
01:30:33,330 --> 01:30:36,110
Yes, but I don't know if you're gonna know who your teammate is.

2761
01:30:36,110 --> 01:30:38,190
I think you don't know who it is.

2762
01:30:38,310 --> 01:30:40,910
If you suspect them, it's better to just let them.

2763
01:30:40,910 --> 01:30:43,090
Yeah, if you suspect it's them, just let them chill a bit.

2764
01:30:44,170 --> 01:30:44,930
Alright, guys.

2765
01:30:45,170 --> 01:30:47,730
I guess we'll see each other's avatars too, right?

2766
01:30:48,110 --> 01:30:53,530
So, like, if we can memorize each other's avatars, then that would...

2767
01:30:53,530 --> 01:30:55,370
Yeah, yeah.

2768
01:30:55,930 --> 01:30:56,970
I'm gonna take a screenshot.

2769
01:31:00,050 --> 01:31:03,650
In case I don't see the avatars.

2770
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:11,880
Okay, Loki, everyone kinda looks like their avatars.

2771
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:12,580
Especially Doki.

2772
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:14,400
Haha.

2773
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:17,700
Yeah, I'm actually 80 years old, guys.

2774
01:31:17,940 --> 01:31:18,320
Wait, I like this.

2775
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:19,560
I like the hair.

2776
01:31:20,420 --> 01:31:21,020
Thank you.

2777
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:21,600
It's my birthday.

2778
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:23,000
That's why I'm wearing a birthday hat.

2779
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:24,400
Happy birthday!

2780
01:31:24,660 --> 01:31:24,940
Yeah!

2781
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:25,720
It's my birthday!

2782
01:31:26,300 --> 01:31:27,860
Can you guys sing happy birthday to me?

2783
01:31:28,460 --> 01:31:28,980
Yeah!

2784
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:29,900
No, no, no.

2785
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:34,020
Happy birthday to you.

2786
01:31:36,660 --> 01:31:40,000
Happy birthday to you.

2787
01:31:40,820 --> 01:31:45,920
Happy birthday Happy birthday to you.

2788
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:48,720
Happy birthday to you.

2789
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:51,460
Happy birthday to you.

2790
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:56,060
Happy birthday to you.

2791
01:31:56,140 --> 01:32:00,820
Happy birthday to you.

2792
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:03,220
Wow, thank you guys.

2793
01:32:03,420 --> 01:32:06,140
You guys made my birthday very special.

2794
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:08,920
Oh.

2795
01:32:08,920 --> 01:32:09,860
It's over, man.

2796
01:32:10,060 --> 01:32:12,260
Are we ready to go?

2797
01:32:12,380 --> 01:32:13,500
Yeah, they were ready, right?

2798
01:32:14,100 --> 01:32:14,340
Let's go.

2799
01:32:14,540 --> 01:32:15,700
Oh, okay.

2800
01:32:16,040 --> 01:32:17,440
Did they ask for... yeah.

2801
01:32:21,540 --> 01:32:23,100
Alright, how to play a game.

2802
01:32:24,980 --> 01:32:26,100
Uh... yeah.

2803
01:32:27,300 --> 01:32:27,860
Yeah.

2804
01:32:29,100 --> 01:32:38,940
Sorry to interrupt your cryo sleep, but I thought it worth mentioning that I, your digital officer during emergencies, or Doki, have detected an alien biorhythm on the ship.

2805
01:32:39,260 --> 01:32:39,820
That's embarrassing.

2806
01:32:40,300 --> 01:32:45,560
And just as I suspected, the aliens uploaded the virus, which is slowly donating to my program.

2807
01:32:45,880 --> 01:32:47,780
I'm here to guide you through if you'd like.

2808
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:49,040
Yeah.

2809
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:49,820
Yes.

2810
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:51,060
I would love a tutorial.

2811
01:32:51,160 --> 01:32:52,400
Yeah, we don't know what's going on.

2812
01:32:52,780 --> 01:32:53,880
We'll go for the tutorial.

2813
01:32:54,140 --> 01:32:54,700
Security protocol.

2814
01:32:55,060 --> 01:32:55,440
Fifth.

2815
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:56,160
Dementia.

2816
01:32:56,220 --> 01:32:56,500
Online.

2817
01:32:56,780 --> 01:33:02,980
Which is a series of tests designed to evaluate your humanity and reveal any aliens hiding amongst you.

2818
01:33:03,180 --> 01:33:03,960
Among us.

2819
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:05,060
Hehe.

2820
01:33:05,240 --> 01:33:05,940
Among you.

2821
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:07,840
Oh, cute.

2822
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:09,400
Secretly aliens.

2823
01:33:10,840 --> 01:33:13,660
Please look at your device and confirm your identity.

2824
01:33:13,980 --> 01:33:15,320
You are human.

2825
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:16,280
I'm human.

2826
01:33:16,620 --> 01:33:17,260
Or an alien.

2827
01:33:17,860 --> 01:33:19,640
Human in all caps, period.

2828
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:26,360
Unfortunately, aliens will know who their compatriots are, so you'll be at a bit of a disadvantage, humans.

2829
01:33:27,720 --> 01:33:29,540
Tenzin, do you know if you're human or an alien?

2830
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:31,860
Sorry, sorry.

2831
01:33:33,080 --> 01:33:34,180
Guys, she lost her ID.

2832
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:34,740
She doesn't remember.

2833
01:33:35,180 --> 01:33:36,520
Oh, I don't know how to lie.

2834
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:40,040
No, no, no, no.

2835
01:33:41,720 --> 01:33:42,120
Oh.

2836
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:42,760
Oh.

2837
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:44,840
So there's three aliens.

2838
01:33:46,620 --> 01:33:46,780
Hello, Peter.

2839
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:48,160
Cool.

2840
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:49,100
I don't know what that means.

2841
01:33:53,340 --> 01:33:55,480
When do we click the button?

2842
01:33:55,780 --> 01:33:57,360
Let's do drawing quarters because Lily likes drawing.

2843
01:33:57,780 --> 01:33:59,240
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2844
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:01,700
Lily's been waiting to draw all day.

2845
01:34:01,900 --> 01:34:03,020
No, I haven't.

2846
01:34:04,840 --> 01:34:06,720
I'm not going to have Lily draw, though, unfortunately.

2847
01:34:06,980 --> 01:34:07,460
Wait, please.

2848
01:34:08,180 --> 01:34:09,200
Please give me this.

2849
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:10,980
Wait, how do I join?

2850
01:34:11,580 --> 01:34:14,420
Oh, he picks the people.

2851
01:34:14,620 --> 01:34:15,740
Welcome to the drawing quarters.

2852
01:34:16,620 --> 01:34:17,960
Let's find out who the aliens are right now.

2853
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:24,860
Draw the best you can because the alien virus will give our intruders a similar yet different prompt.

2854
01:34:25,220 --> 01:34:25,800
Oh.

2855
01:34:26,740 --> 01:34:29,640
Cast suspicion on any It's so funny.

2856
01:34:31,020 --> 01:34:32,640
Those drawings are so good.

2857
01:34:32,900 --> 01:34:36,480
As time goes on, I'll do my best to send the aliens harder prompts.

2858
01:34:36,680 --> 01:34:37,560
You're welcome.

2859
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:38,480
Okay.

2860
01:34:49,190 --> 01:34:52,650
Oh, wow, this game lasts 18 in real life minutes?

2861
01:34:56,010 --> 01:34:57,530
No, I think it's like the whole game.

2862
01:34:57,870 --> 01:34:58,410
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2863
01:34:58,410 --> 01:34:59,230
No, no, that's what I meant.

2864
01:34:59,470 --> 01:35:01,610
I didn't think it would last 18 whole minutes.

2865
01:35:02,770 --> 01:35:04,510
Are you going to rush to somewhere to be?

2866
01:35:04,610 --> 01:35:05,150
No, no, no.

2867
01:35:05,150 --> 01:35:05,570
What does that mean?

2868
01:35:07,830 --> 01:35:09,730
I don't know, but I'm scared to touch it.

2869
01:35:09,730 --> 01:35:10,510
I can hurry you guys if you want.

2870
01:35:10,630 --> 01:35:12,430
You know, I'm going to hurry because Lily's going to have too much detail.

2871
01:35:12,770 --> 01:35:13,690
Oh, it's the timer.

2872
01:35:13,950 --> 01:35:16,830
Oh, guys, you guys only have like 10 seconds.

2873
01:35:17,330 --> 01:35:18,790
Oh, it moves that.

2874
01:35:19,090 --> 01:35:19,310
Oh.

2875
01:35:19,310 --> 01:35:19,390
Oh.

2876
01:35:20,050 --> 01:35:20,530
Okay.

2877
01:35:22,450 --> 01:35:23,410
All right.

2878
01:35:25,210 --> 01:35:26,710
Spend more time, I think, right?

2879
01:35:27,230 --> 01:35:29,150
Oh, no, I was thinking because...

2880
01:35:29,150 --> 01:35:29,470
Oh.

2881
01:35:34,580 --> 01:35:35,060
.

2882
01:35:38,660 --> 01:35:39,140
.

2883
01:35:39,140 --> 01:35:39,400
.

2884
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:39,440
.

2885
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:39,800
.

2886
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:40,160
.

2887
01:35:40,160 --> 01:35:40,180
.

2888
01:35:40,180 --> 01:35:40,220
.

2889
01:35:51,060 --> 01:35:51,940
Clearly, she's...

2890
01:35:51,940 --> 01:35:54,860
She is really good at Apex, to be fair.

2891
01:35:55,140 --> 01:35:55,160
The third one's cooking?

2892
01:35:56,240 --> 01:35:57,120
Yeah, right?

2893
01:35:58,420 --> 01:35:58,760
.

2894
01:36:00,920 --> 01:36:03,760
Our favorite thing to do.

2895
01:36:04,980 --> 01:36:06,400
Guys, no, I'm human.

2896
01:36:06,440 --> 01:36:08,000
I swear to God, I'm human.

2897
01:36:08,240 --> 01:36:09,560
I swear to God.

2898
01:36:10,180 --> 01:36:12,940
Guys, I swear to God.

2899
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:15,200
I just did...

2900
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:18,820
I don't have a talent, so I was like, what do I do, you know?

2901
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:19,260
.

2902
01:36:21,060 --> 01:36:21,380
I'm laughing.

2903
01:36:22,690 --> 01:36:23,160
Okay.

2904
01:36:24,240 --> 01:36:24,900
.

2905
01:36:24,900 --> 01:36:26,240
.

2906
01:36:29,320 --> 01:36:30,600
Let's go to...

2907
01:36:30,600 --> 01:36:32,220
the Onion Hold.

2908
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:32,640
.

2909
01:36:34,820 --> 01:36:37,020
I would like to test...

2910
01:36:37,020 --> 01:36:42,400
you, you, and you.

2911
01:36:45,210 --> 01:36:46,150
.

2912
01:36:46,150 --> 01:36:46,370
.

2913
01:36:53,250 --> 01:36:53,730
.

2914
01:36:53,730 --> 01:36:53,950
.

2915
01:36:57,650 --> 01:36:58,130
.

2916
01:36:58,130 --> 01:36:58,590
.

2917
01:36:58,590 --> 01:36:59,030
.

2918
01:36:59,030 --> 01:36:59,110
.

2919
01:36:59,110 --> 01:36:59,210
.

2920
01:36:59,210 --> 01:36:59,270

2921
01:37:04,870 --> 01:37:05,350

2922
01:37:05,350 --> 01:37:05,370
.

2923
01:37:05,370 --> 01:37:05,990
.

2924
01:37:05,990 --> 01:37:06,850
.

2925
01:37:19,510 --> 01:37:20,110
.

2926
01:37:20,110 --> 01:37:20,210
.

2927
01:37:20,210 --> 01:37:20,550
.

2928
01:37:20,550 --> 01:37:20,610

2929
01:37:20,610 --> 01:37:20,910

2930
01:37:20,910 --> 01:37:21,090

.

2933

2937

2938

2947
01:37:46,630 --> 01:37:47,770
.

2948
01:37:48,750 --> 01:37:49,510
.

2949
01:37:49,510 --> 01:37:50,310
Sorry, I'm high.

2950
01:37:50,690 --> 01:37:50,890
.

2951
01:37:52,210 --> 01:37:52,930
.

2952
01:37:52,930 --> 01:37:53,970
.

2953
01:37:53,970 --> 01:37:54,010
.

2954
01:37:55,290 --> 01:37:56,010
.

2955
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:57,250
.

2956
01:37:57,250 --> 01:38:00,430
Okay, I mean, they all seem, like, believable, so I don't know.

2957
01:38:00,650 --> 01:38:01,030
.

2958
01:38:01,030 --> 01:38:05,030
I feel like this one was, like, kind of, whatever.

2959
01:38:05,590 --> 01:38:05,970
.

2960
01:38:07,810 --> 01:38:08,990
Yeah, that's what I thought.

2961
01:38:09,430 --> 01:38:11,070
Oh, that's why I'm scared.

2962
01:38:11,210 --> 01:38:12,010
You never know, you know?

2963
01:38:13,390 --> 01:38:13,770
.

2964
01:38:16,090 --> 01:38:16,470
Oh.

2965
01:38:18,010 --> 01:38:18,390
.

2966
01:38:18,390 --> 01:38:18,850
Oh.

2967
01:38:18,850 --> 01:38:19,050
.

2968
01:38:19,050 --> 01:38:19,730
.

2969
01:38:22,670 --> 01:38:23,210
.

2970
01:38:29,490 --> 01:38:30,570
.

2971
01:38:30,570 --> 01:38:30,690
.

2972
01:38:30,690 --> 01:38:31,510
.

2973
01:38:31,510 --> 01:38:31,690
.

2974
01:38:31,690 --> 01:38:31,710
.

2975
01:38:31,710 --> 01:38:32,110
.

2976
01:38:32,110 --> 01:38:32,130
.

2977
01:38:32,130 --> 01:38:33,570
.

2978
01:38:33,570 --> 01:38:33,670
.

2979
01:38:43,890 --> 01:38:44,970
.

2980
01:38:44,970 --> 01:38:45,210
This thing is fun.

2981
01:38:45,870 --> 01:38:47,170
I'ma choose you.

2982
01:38:47,630 --> 01:38:48,190
Yay!

2983
01:38:49,670 --> 01:38:50,930
Jack hasn't yet.

2984
01:38:51,850 --> 01:38:53,770
And everybody else has already.

2985
01:38:54,110 --> 01:38:54,590
I would choose you as well.

2986
01:38:55,150 --> 01:38:55,890
Oh, me?

2987
01:38:56,790 --> 01:38:57,350
Me?

2988
01:38:58,590 --> 01:38:59,530
I'm human!

2989
01:39:00,570 --> 01:39:01,770
Yeah, yeah!

2990
01:39:02,110 --> 01:39:02,670
.

2991
01:39:02,670 --> 01:39:04,270
Really, your birthday?

2992
01:39:05,330 --> 01:39:06,370
I guess it's wrong.

2993
01:39:07,290 --> 01:39:09,170
Why did you say that out loud?

2994
01:39:11,970 --> 01:39:12,770
Hurry up.

2995
01:39:13,890 --> 01:39:14,850
Hurry up.

2996
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:18,620
Oh, wait.

2997
01:39:18,700 --> 01:39:19,880
No, I did it wrong.

2998
01:39:21,140 --> 01:39:21,540
Guys,

2999
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:26,260
please, don't sabotage me, please.

3000
01:39:27,620 --> 01:39:28,020
Interesting.

3001
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:29,780
You did it wrong, huh?

3002
01:39:30,680 --> 01:39:31,080
Intriguing.

3003
01:39:31,340 --> 01:39:31,740
Oh, no.

3004
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:34,960
What do I want?

3005
01:39:35,120 --> 01:39:35,960
Oh, I know what I want.

3006
01:39:41,790 --> 01:39:43,050
I'm not an artist, so...

3007
01:39:43,050 --> 01:39:44,110
Ah, it's beeping and scaring me!

3008
01:39:48,390 --> 01:39:50,290
Draw a birthday present.

3009
01:39:50,590 --> 01:39:51,850
Oh, that's gonna be fun.

3010
01:39:53,430 --> 01:39:54,470
Wait, okay.

3011
01:39:54,810 --> 01:39:55,710
I don't know.

3012
01:39:56,810 --> 01:39:57,970
Would you clarify?

3013
01:39:58,270 --> 01:39:59,250
Like, what's the...

3014
01:39:59,810 --> 01:40:08,050
No, because I thought it meant a birthday present that we're giving people, and I like money, so people would give me money for birthday presents.

3015
01:40:08,570 --> 01:40:09,550
Is that how you look?

3016
01:40:09,830 --> 01:40:11,050
Yeah, that's how I went in.

3017
01:40:11,050 --> 01:40:14,050
I didn't realize it meant you draw an exact birthday present.

3018
01:40:14,890 --> 01:40:16,130
Guys, please, I'm here.

3019
01:40:16,150 --> 01:40:16,310
We're human.

3020
01:40:16,330 --> 01:40:17,010
We're losers.

3021
01:40:17,210 --> 01:40:18,450
You guys vote for me, please.

3022
01:40:18,590 --> 01:40:19,610
Why are you angry, though?

3023
01:40:19,730 --> 01:40:20,710
Why are you angry?

3024
01:40:21,110 --> 01:40:21,710
I swear.

3025
01:40:22,630 --> 01:40:23,410
I swear.

3026
01:40:23,610 --> 01:40:25,690
I'm just doing this really badly.

3027
01:40:27,590 --> 01:40:30,430
You just look like a character.

3028
01:40:32,870 --> 01:40:35,330
I'm literally throwing for content, guys.

3029
01:40:38,670 --> 01:40:39,190
Yeah.

3030
01:40:43,450 --> 01:40:45,250
I can't read, please.

3031
01:40:46,250 --> 01:40:47,290
Sweetie God, I'm human.

3032
01:40:47,910 --> 01:40:49,010
What are we thinking?

3033
01:40:49,310 --> 01:40:52,290
Are we confident?

3034
01:40:52,710 --> 01:40:53,770
Like, do we have an idea?

3035
01:40:54,850 --> 01:40:55,510
I don't know.

3036
01:40:55,510 --> 01:40:56,110
I'm dropping.

3037
01:40:56,770 --> 01:40:57,530
I'm popping.

3038
01:40:57,690 --> 01:41:00,170
Guys, I swear to God, I'm throwing for content.

3039
01:41:03,290 --> 01:41:04,430
Wait, what is happening?

3040
01:41:04,670 --> 01:41:05,830
We need three aliens.

3041
01:41:06,770 --> 01:41:07,690
Alright, hold on.

3042
01:41:07,850 --> 01:41:08,530
Are we doing all at once?

3043
01:41:08,790 --> 01:41:11,570
Hold on.

3044
01:41:12,310 --> 01:41:12,790
Why?

3045
01:41:13,930 --> 01:41:14,750
We don't have enough info.

3046
01:41:16,150 --> 01:41:17,330
Wait, I don't get it.

3047
01:41:18,250 --> 01:41:20,470
Do we not get the same answer on the prompt?

3048
01:41:22,650 --> 01:41:25,570
If you're human and you vote me up...

3049
01:41:26,090 --> 01:41:26,910
You know what?

3050
01:41:26,930 --> 01:41:27,090
No.

3051
01:41:27,230 --> 01:41:28,890
I hope Peter votes me up.

3052
01:41:29,170 --> 01:41:31,890
Wait, I'm so dead right now.

3053
01:41:32,530 --> 01:41:38,110
I hope Peter votes me up just because, like, humans will lose if he gets the wrong one.

3054
01:41:39,530 --> 01:41:42,190
These are just my suspicions.

3055
01:41:42,230 --> 01:41:42,970
But if you don't want to vote up...

3056
01:41:42,970 --> 01:41:44,490
We actually lose if we vote, though.

3057
01:41:44,570 --> 01:41:45,730
You can vote against.

3058
01:41:45,990 --> 01:41:46,810
Vote failed, guys.

3059
01:41:46,910 --> 01:41:47,310
It's okay.

3060
01:41:48,690 --> 01:41:51,870
I will say that I would put Doki there, too.

3061
01:41:52,970 --> 01:41:54,550
I know we were just together, but...

3062
01:41:54,550 --> 01:41:54,570
No!

3063
01:41:54,590 --> 01:41:56,210
We voted me out!

3064
01:41:56,290 --> 01:41:57,090
Peter would lose!

3065
01:41:58,730 --> 01:41:59,930
I'm gonna be honest, guys.

3066
01:42:00,030 --> 01:42:00,770
That's my bad.

3067
01:42:00,870 --> 01:42:02,190
I didn't know we were voting three up.

3068
01:42:02,410 --> 01:42:04,210
I'm hella sus of Doki.

3069
01:42:05,010 --> 01:42:06,950
Wait, we should drunk that damn up already.

3070
01:42:06,950 --> 01:42:07,350
This is really bad at this game.

3071
01:42:07,430 --> 01:42:12,550
I don't do well on depression, guys.

3072
01:42:12,550 --> 01:42:13,330
Don't get up there.

3073
01:42:15,210 --> 01:42:15,770
Why me?

3074
01:42:15,930 --> 01:42:17,010
I'm just a human.

3075
01:42:17,090 --> 01:42:18,450
I just want to see you draw, man.

3076
01:42:18,850 --> 01:42:19,930
No, oh, no, no.

3077
01:42:20,710 --> 01:42:21,770
Sorry if you already drew it.

3078
01:42:21,830 --> 01:42:23,130
I was not paying attention to who was drawing.

3079
01:42:24,010 --> 01:42:24,550
Hurry up.

3080
01:42:25,350 --> 01:42:26,230
Actually, you're welcome, Lily.

3081
01:42:27,470 --> 01:42:27,950
Hurry up.

3082
01:42:32,870 --> 01:42:33,190
Oh.

3083
01:42:33,770 --> 01:42:35,270
You guys got five seconds?

3084
01:42:43,700 --> 01:42:45,840
Okay, you good?

3085
01:42:45,980 --> 01:42:46,940
Why are you laughing?

3086
01:42:47,140 --> 01:42:48,020
Why are you laughing?

3087
01:42:48,720 --> 01:42:50,860
Dude, she's definitely fucking with someone.

3088
01:42:51,380 --> 01:42:52,600
Yes, she is.

3089
01:42:54,820 --> 01:42:57,800
We definitely know which one is the alien.

3090
01:42:58,380 --> 01:42:59,800
I know what you did.

3091
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:04,480
I got nervous.

3092
01:43:04,540 --> 01:43:06,560
I submitted early, even though I didn't need to.

3093
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:07,880
Same.

3094
01:43:12,340 --> 01:43:12,860
Pause.

3095
01:43:12,860 --> 01:43:13,760
Oh, it stopped.

3096
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:15,600
You're digitizing.

3097
01:43:16,840 --> 01:43:18,920
Because I swear I'm human, guys.

3098
01:43:19,020 --> 01:43:20,240
I'm just very suspicious.

3099
01:43:20,340 --> 01:43:21,560
I'm bad at this game.

3100
01:43:21,580 --> 01:43:21,980
Wait, what?

3101
01:43:24,820 --> 01:43:26,260
My thing didn't go through.

3102
01:43:26,640 --> 01:43:27,840
Wait, what did you draw?

3103
01:43:28,120 --> 01:43:30,240
Peter, what did you draw?

3104
01:43:31,240 --> 01:43:32,200
A yapper.

3105
01:43:32,220 --> 01:43:32,900
What do you mean?

3106
01:43:34,020 --> 01:43:35,320
With no mouths?

3107
01:43:35,860 --> 01:43:37,880
It just looks like they're about to hug.

3108
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:39,000
Wait.

3109
01:43:40,500 --> 01:43:40,960
It's a baby by accident.

3110
01:43:41,660 --> 01:43:42,740
It's not a baby at all.

3111
01:43:43,400 --> 01:43:44,480
Mine didn't go through.

3112
01:43:45,020 --> 01:43:46,860
Mine says mansplaining on it.

3113
01:43:47,720 --> 01:43:48,120
Mansplaining?

3114
01:43:49,200 --> 01:43:49,980
That's kind of sus.

3115
01:43:50,220 --> 01:43:52,460
I think Gumi is good.

3116
01:43:54,100 --> 01:43:55,100
I mean, they're all good.

3117
01:43:55,160 --> 01:43:56,740
Clearly, his worst date is no date.

3118
01:43:58,920 --> 01:43:59,320
Wait,

3119
01:44:04,980 --> 01:44:05,960
so we don't have to vote, right?

3120
01:44:06,780 --> 01:44:07,800
You don't have to.

3121
01:44:07,800 --> 01:44:07,960
What?

3122
01:44:09,180 --> 01:44:11,020
Just because my drawing is bad?

3123
01:44:11,160 --> 01:44:11,640
Leave me alone.

3124
01:44:14,140 --> 01:44:17,020
Wait, how many rounds do we get for this?

3125
01:44:17,560 --> 01:44:19,680
We got nine minutes to figure out.

3126
01:44:19,700 --> 01:44:20,100
Nine?

3127
01:44:20,820 --> 01:44:21,740
There's a timer.

3128
01:44:21,880 --> 01:44:23,400
Holy shit, this is a long game.

3129
01:44:24,440 --> 01:44:24,960
Golly.

3130
01:44:25,980 --> 01:44:30,360
You'll be able to analyze any player and find out if they're an alien.

3131
01:44:30,620 --> 01:44:30,660
Oh.

3132
01:44:30,900 --> 01:44:32,440
Guys, I swear to god, just scan me.

3133
01:44:32,460 --> 01:44:33,620
I swear to god.

3134
01:44:33,620 --> 01:44:36,120
We shouldn't scan Dookie.

3135
01:44:36,460 --> 01:44:39,080
We know for sure it's her.

3136
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:40,980
We know for sure it's her.

3137
01:44:42,280 --> 01:44:43,580
So who should I do?

3138
01:44:44,580 --> 01:44:46,660
Someone you trust and someone you don't trust.

3139
01:44:46,680 --> 01:44:47,140
Guys, please.

3140
01:44:49,720 --> 01:44:54,340
You should probably do people on the opposite team that you think is a bad guy.

3141
01:44:55,400 --> 01:44:57,340
That would get us the most points.

3142
01:44:58,080 --> 01:44:59,400
You're right, don't scan me.

3143
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:03,000
Wait, what?

3144
01:45:03,620 --> 01:45:04,200
Oh, that's fine.

3145
01:45:07,220 --> 01:45:07,660
Okay.

3146
01:45:08,100 --> 01:45:09,500
I think that's reasonable.

3147
01:45:09,780 --> 01:45:10,520
I don't know, I just picked someone.

3148
01:45:10,660 --> 01:45:11,420
The bioscanner.

3149
01:45:11,980 --> 01:45:14,060
Unfortunately, the virus has got this place.

3150
01:45:14,280 --> 01:45:14,720
Oh.

3151
01:45:15,460 --> 01:45:18,340
The consequence will see a set of alien glyphs on their device.

3152
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:22,720
The captain will only see three glyphs and must describe them out loud.

3153
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:23,980
Lily, you're screwed.

3154
01:45:25,680 --> 01:45:28,200
If the glyphs match, the test will pass.

3155
01:45:28,200 --> 01:45:29,620
Wait, all of us has to have it?

3156
01:45:30,200 --> 01:45:30,860
No, no, no.

3157
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:33,600
Lily will listen to me intending what the symbols look like.

3158
01:45:33,620 --> 01:45:36,100
The aliens may fail by tapping the wrong glyph on purpose.

3159
01:45:38,060 --> 01:45:38,460
Oh.

3160
01:45:38,660 --> 01:45:39,060
Oh.

3161
01:45:39,060 --> 01:45:39,820
Okay, listen.

3162
01:45:39,980 --> 01:45:42,820
The middle one looks like a person tripping.

3163
01:45:43,220 --> 01:45:45,660
And his right arm is like out in the air.

3164
01:45:45,740 --> 01:45:47,320
And his right foot is also in the air.

3165
01:45:47,740 --> 01:45:48,460
I got it.

3166
01:45:48,620 --> 01:45:50,760
The left one looks like...

3167
01:45:51,420 --> 01:45:52,220
Ah, shoot.

3168
01:45:52,520 --> 01:45:53,500
It's like mirrored.

3169
01:45:53,780 --> 01:45:54,380
There's a...

3170
01:45:54,380 --> 01:45:55,640
Oh, shit.

3171
01:45:55,720 --> 01:45:56,140
Oh, poop.

3172
01:45:56,220 --> 01:45:57,520
With the circle at the bottom?

3173
01:45:57,700 --> 01:45:58,880
Yeah, the circle at the top.

3174
01:45:58,980 --> 01:46:00,880
It's like a fat T, but horizontal.

3175
01:46:01,380 --> 01:46:03,820
And then there's another one to the opposite side of it.

3176
01:46:04,100 --> 01:46:06,800
But the line is bigger that's like coming out of it.

3177
01:46:07,380 --> 01:46:09,760
It looks like a person like kicking almost.

3178
01:46:09,960 --> 01:46:10,580
I see it.

3179
01:46:10,580 --> 01:46:11,200
And it's mirrored?

3180
01:46:11,580 --> 01:46:12,580
Yes, it's mirrored.

3181
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:13,420
And there's one circle at the top.

3182
01:46:13,420 --> 01:46:13,740
Kind of diagonally.

3183
01:46:13,740 --> 01:46:14,740
It makes a diagonal line.

3184
01:46:15,020 --> 01:46:16,040
Yes, it's also diagonal.

3185
01:46:16,680 --> 01:46:17,620
Okay, got that one.

3186
01:46:17,620 --> 01:46:19,200
Okay, and the third one looks like a...

3187
01:46:19,200 --> 01:46:23,680
It looks like a ghost with a little stick pointing out at the top.

3188
01:46:23,700 --> 01:46:24,960
And there's two circles in it.

3189
01:46:25,020 --> 01:46:26,640
One in its head and one in its body.

3190
01:46:27,280 --> 01:46:29,520
Yeah, it looks like Vex from League.

3191
01:46:30,220 --> 01:46:30,820
Kind of.

3192
01:46:30,900 --> 01:46:31,940
It's a bell shape.

3193
01:46:32,060 --> 01:46:33,300
And the bottom is open.

3194
01:46:33,620 --> 01:46:34,480
Tenzin, are you okay?

3195
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:35,560
You haven't said anything.

3196
01:46:35,980 --> 01:46:36,120
Okay.

3197
01:46:37,100 --> 01:46:39,520
I am truly trying hard to understand.

3198
01:46:40,900 --> 01:46:42,300
Tenzin, you haven't said anything.

3199
01:46:42,320 --> 01:46:42,960
I'm worried.

3200
01:46:43,040 --> 01:46:43,400
Sorry.

3201
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:44,500
I'm telling you.

3202
01:46:44,520 --> 01:46:44,800
I'm not lying.

3203
01:46:44,900 --> 01:46:46,000
I'm focusing really hard.

3204
01:46:46,180 --> 01:46:47,840
The first one, it looks like a guy.

3205
01:46:47,900 --> 01:46:48,960
He's kicking to the right.

3206
01:46:49,060 --> 01:46:51,660
And he has something on his back that looks like his body.

3207
01:46:51,720 --> 01:46:52,540
But it's mirrored.

3208
01:46:53,280 --> 01:46:54,920
Oh, so he's mirrored.

3209
01:46:55,160 --> 01:46:55,540
Yeah.

3210
01:46:56,540 --> 01:46:58,300
And the second one, the guy...

3211
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:00,680
He tripped and fell.

3212
01:47:00,780 --> 01:47:02,260
His right arm is to the sky.

3213
01:47:02,440 --> 01:47:03,940
The right leg is to the sky.

3214
01:47:04,240 --> 01:47:06,440
So it's the same as the other one?

3215
01:47:06,940 --> 01:47:07,340
No.

3216
01:47:07,460 --> 01:47:07,860
No.

3217
01:47:08,020 --> 01:47:08,380
What?

3218
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:09,480
What part of that?

3219
01:47:10,740 --> 01:47:11,720
He's also tripping.

3220
01:47:12,120 --> 01:47:12,900
He's tripping.

3221
01:47:13,500 --> 01:47:14,740
Yeah, so there's two people tripping.

3222
01:47:15,800 --> 01:47:16,980
The second one...

3223
01:47:16,980 --> 01:47:17,720
Wait, is it an alien?

3224
01:47:17,860 --> 01:47:18,540
Does it have an antenna?

3225
01:47:19,940 --> 01:47:21,760
Yes, a tiny little antenna.

3226
01:47:21,900 --> 01:47:23,040
The third one has an antenna.

3227
01:47:23,160 --> 01:47:25,140
Okay, so two of them are both not tripping.

3228
01:47:25,420 --> 01:47:25,960
Oh, man.

3229
01:47:27,180 --> 01:47:28,240
Wait, where's the timer?

3230
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:30,220
At the bottom, at the bottom!

3231
01:47:30,460 --> 01:47:32,280
Three, two, one.

3232
01:47:38,200 --> 01:47:39,000
Oh, dude.

3233
01:47:39,240 --> 01:47:39,440
Uh-oh.

3234
01:47:40,340 --> 01:47:41,500
You tried your best, man.

3235
01:47:41,620 --> 01:47:42,300
You tried your best.

3236
01:47:42,300 --> 01:47:42,700
Let me see.

3237
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:46,360
I thought you said two tripping.

3238
01:47:47,860 --> 01:47:49,300
That was close, Tenzin.

3239
01:47:49,360 --> 01:47:51,080
And I clicked the wrong one?

3240
01:47:51,920 --> 01:47:52,500
It's okay, Tenzin.

3241
01:47:52,500 --> 01:47:53,180
You tried your best.

3242
01:47:53,540 --> 01:47:56,040
Sorry, I thought you guys said two tripping.

3243
01:47:56,080 --> 01:47:58,300
So I took off the other one, which was the last one.

3244
01:47:58,300 --> 01:47:59,580
Wait, what does this mean?

3245
01:48:00,240 --> 01:48:03,260
So this means Jack got all of them right.

3246
01:48:03,320 --> 01:48:05,560
So Jack is pretty human to me.

3247
01:48:05,780 --> 01:48:08,240
But Tenzin, I don't know.

3248
01:48:08,500 --> 01:48:09,240
Wait, I'm sorry.

3249
01:48:09,340 --> 01:48:10,680
I thought you said he's tripping twice.

3250
01:48:11,740 --> 01:48:12,900
This one's kind of hard.

3251
01:48:13,280 --> 01:48:14,800
I kind of believe Tenzin.

3252
01:48:14,940 --> 01:48:15,900
Yeah, this one's hard.

3253
01:48:16,160 --> 01:48:18,060
Yeah, that was a hard one.

3254
01:48:18,760 --> 01:48:20,560
Wait, I would have had the wrong one.

3255
01:48:20,720 --> 01:48:22,380
I mean, the one I was asking about.

3256
01:48:22,420 --> 01:48:23,320
That's the only one I get wrong.

3257
01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:31,080
What's with all the alarms?

3258
01:48:32,160 --> 01:48:35,080
We have five minutes left to figure out the aliens.

3259
01:48:35,280 --> 01:48:36,040
Oh, we're so scared.

3260
01:48:36,700 --> 01:48:40,780
I feel like aliens is easier to be.

3261
01:48:41,320 --> 01:48:42,700
Wait, what's Riding Pod?

3262
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:44,720
I don't know.

3263
01:48:44,940 --> 01:48:45,820
What is that?

3264
01:48:47,080 --> 01:48:49,280
Who has been tested the least?

3265
01:48:51,800 --> 01:48:53,260
I'm so bad at Riding Pod.

3266
01:48:53,320 --> 01:48:54,200
Wait, you know I'm human.

3267
01:48:54,280 --> 01:48:55,100
Put me against...

3268
01:48:55,100 --> 01:48:56,340
Oh, that's true.

3269
01:48:56,340 --> 01:48:57,520
I'm also a human, Doki.

3270
01:48:57,940 --> 01:48:59,140
I'm sorry, Jack.

3271
01:49:00,980 --> 01:49:03,100
Welcome to the Riding Pod.

3272
01:49:03,240 --> 01:49:04,000
I get hacked here?

3273
01:49:04,300 --> 01:49:07,580
By the last alien?

3274
01:49:09,380 --> 01:49:14,040
The alien virus will allow the intruders to get something similar but not quite right.

3275
01:49:14,280 --> 01:49:19,800
When the correct prompt is revealed, it will be up to you to determine if any seem odd.

3276
01:49:21,220 --> 01:49:21,740
Oh.

3277
01:49:23,320 --> 01:49:26,740
As time winds down, I'll do my best to send the aliens some real stinkers.

3278
01:49:26,820 --> 01:49:28,040
It's the least I can do.

3279
01:49:29,680 --> 01:49:30,900
What does that mean?

3280
01:49:31,240 --> 01:49:32,260
Does that mean I'm hacked?

3281
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:35,120
No, I think all of us are.

3282
01:49:35,860 --> 01:49:36,360
Oh, okay.

3283
01:49:36,420 --> 01:49:36,820
Yeah.

3284
01:49:38,520 --> 01:49:40,360
I think the time is just going down.

3285
01:49:40,380 --> 01:49:42,640
Yeah, because the virus.

3286
01:49:42,760 --> 01:49:46,440
The longer the aliens are here, the more virus there'll be.

3287
01:49:47,100 --> 01:49:49,080
How do you know so much about that, Doki?

3288
01:49:49,100 --> 01:49:49,780
That's kind of crazy.

3289
01:49:49,780 --> 01:49:51,800
Well, that's what Christine literally just said.

3290
01:49:52,300 --> 01:49:59,160
I thought the aliens are viruses.

3291
01:50:04,260 --> 01:50:05,580
It's like a look here.

3292
01:50:11,040 --> 01:50:11,820
Oh.

3293
01:50:15,140 --> 01:50:15,540
Okay.

3294
01:50:15,880 --> 01:50:16,640
Oh.

3295
01:50:17,940 --> 01:50:18,720
Okay.

3296
01:50:19,780 --> 01:50:20,060
Yeah.

3297
01:50:20,060 --> 01:50:20,680
That's me.

3298
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:21,400
Not me.

3299
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:23,480
Okay, well.

3300
01:50:24,740 --> 01:50:26,140
That's so funny.

3301
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:31,140
Just for background of my one, I'm allergic to dairy.

3302
01:50:31,180 --> 01:50:31,920
What did your prompt say?

3303
01:50:32,120 --> 01:50:38,080
So you would say, ew, if you saw Why were you very specific?

3304
01:50:38,480 --> 01:50:39,680
Why couldn't you say milk?

3305
01:50:41,460 --> 01:50:41,980
Milk?

3306
01:50:42,540 --> 01:50:43,520
I don't want to be fancy.

3307
01:50:43,580 --> 01:50:44,300
I don't want to be basic.

3308
01:51:07,540 --> 01:51:11,820
I feel like you should put the people you're suspicious onto the drawing.

3309
01:51:13,460 --> 01:51:14,460
Please don't put me again.

3310
01:51:14,540 --> 01:51:15,780
I'm actually not an alien.

3311
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:17,380
Please don't put me back in there.

3312
01:51:22,770 --> 01:51:24,890
Get your drawing fingers ready.

3313
01:51:25,110 --> 01:51:26,270
Oh, we have three minutes.

3314
01:51:27,110 --> 01:51:28,230
Alright, everybody press hurry.

3315
01:51:28,370 --> 01:51:29,110
Everybody press hurry.

3316
01:51:31,090 --> 01:51:31,730
Press hurry!

3317
01:51:42,360 --> 01:51:43,820
So, what prompt did you guys get?

3318
01:51:46,340 --> 01:51:47,140
Don't worry about it.

3319
01:51:47,300 --> 01:51:47,960
I'm submitting...

3320
01:51:51,180 --> 01:51:52,080
I feel rushed.

3321
01:51:52,180 --> 01:51:52,480
I'm submitting.

3322
01:51:53,500 --> 01:51:54,540
Tenzin, what's your prompt?

3323
01:51:55,720 --> 01:51:56,360
I'm drawing.

3324
01:52:06,940 --> 01:52:08,040
We need to have a talk.

3325
01:52:09,320 --> 01:52:09,640
What?

3326
01:52:10,220 --> 01:52:11,240
Peter, what did you draw?

3327
01:52:11,920 --> 01:52:12,620
Peter, what is that?

3328
01:52:12,700 --> 01:52:14,160
When you draw a skeleton, do you see the ribs?

3329
01:52:15,920 --> 01:52:16,660
Oh, I know.

3330
01:52:16,660 --> 01:52:16,760
Tenzin.

3331
01:52:17,540 --> 01:52:17,900
Okay.

3332
01:52:18,040 --> 01:52:19,660
Ariana Grande from Fortnite.

3333
01:52:20,220 --> 01:52:21,220
Tenzin, what did you draw?

3334
01:52:21,660 --> 01:52:22,020
Okay.

3335
01:52:25,160 --> 01:52:26,180
Sorry to all the Arienators.

3336
01:52:26,200 --> 01:52:26,660
I wasn't hacked.

3337
01:52:26,680 --> 01:52:29,940
I got draw something spooky, but I just tried drawing a skeleton, but it was really bad.

3338
01:52:30,440 --> 01:52:30,780
Okay.

3339
01:52:31,080 --> 01:52:32,760
You had lots of... Okay.

3340
01:52:33,480 --> 01:52:35,280
I feel like I know who the three are.

3341
01:52:36,300 --> 01:52:37,620
I feel like we all know, right?

3342
01:52:38,080 --> 01:52:38,440
Yeah.

3343
01:52:40,060 --> 01:52:41,200
Is Gumi gonna do it though?

3344
01:52:41,420 --> 01:52:43,560
You only get one minute, so act quickly.

3345
01:52:45,100 --> 01:52:46,640
Gumi, I see... Gumi, I see... Gumi, I see... Gumi, I see... Gumi, I see... Gumi, I see... Gumi, I see... Gumi, I see...

3346
01:52:46,640 --> 01:53:01,240
Gumi, I see... Gumi, I see... Gumi, I see... Gumi, I see... Gumi, I see... Gumi, I see... Gumi, I see...

3347
01:53:07,640 --> 01:53:09,660
I feel like this is not quite right, is it?

3348
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:11,880
That was my suspicion.

3349
01:53:11,880 --> 01:53:15,040
We only have one alien and we have two, so our multiplier is bigger than them.

3350
01:53:20,280 --> 01:53:21,000
One minute.

3351
01:53:21,080 --> 01:53:22,480
You only have one minute and 30 seconds.

3352
01:53:22,740 --> 01:53:24,680
I want to try the bioscanner.

3353
01:53:25,540 --> 01:53:26,440
I got you, Goomy.

3354
01:53:26,580 --> 01:53:27,500
Who do you want to go against?

3355
01:53:28,020 --> 01:53:28,800
I don't know anyone.

3356
01:53:29,940 --> 01:53:33,280
Please, please, put me in and you'll know I'm not an alien.

3357
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:34,560
Please, I swear to God.

3358
01:53:34,840 --> 01:53:34,980
Shut up!

3359
01:53:36,280 --> 01:53:38,100
We're all on the same team, Goomy!

3360
01:53:40,580 --> 01:53:42,880
Jack, choose someone.

3361
01:53:43,700 --> 01:53:44,480
Oh, really?

3362
01:53:44,700 --> 01:53:45,420
Do I have to choose someone?

3363
01:53:45,420 --> 01:53:45,780
Choose Peter.

3364
01:53:45,980 --> 01:53:47,380
I think he's very suspicious.

3365
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:49,220
Fuck it.

3366
01:53:49,300 --> 01:53:49,700
Choose me.

3367
01:53:49,720 --> 01:53:50,120
I don't care.

3368
01:53:50,920 --> 01:53:51,720
Choose someone.

3369
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:52,040
Time.

3370
01:53:52,840 --> 01:53:53,740
Who should I pick?

3371
01:53:53,740 --> 01:53:55,760
The more you decide, we're running out of time.

3372
01:53:55,800 --> 01:53:56,760
You have to pick.

3373
01:53:57,200 --> 01:53:58,500
We have very low on time.

3374
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:02,020
Wait, I think Jack is purposely stalling.

3375
01:54:02,280 --> 01:54:02,640
Jack?

3376
01:54:02,640 --> 01:54:03,680
Jack is stalling?

3377
01:54:03,780 --> 01:54:04,540
Wait, push the button.

3378
01:54:04,540 --> 01:54:05,800
Push the button if he's stalling.

3379
01:54:06,240 --> 01:54:06,860
I'm hacked.

3380
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:07,300
I'm hacked.

3381
01:54:07,400 --> 01:54:09,100
I don't have button.

3382
01:54:09,500 --> 01:54:10,160
I don't have button.

3383
01:54:10,160 --> 01:54:10,520
I'm holding.

3384
01:54:10,540 --> 01:54:10,980
I'm pushing.

3385
01:54:11,080 --> 01:54:11,360
I'm pushing.

3386
01:54:11,700 --> 01:54:12,400
I did it.

3387
01:54:12,400 --> 01:54:12,600
I did it.

3388
01:54:12,660 --> 01:54:12,760
I did it.

3389
01:54:12,760 --> 01:54:12,860
Okay.

3390
01:54:13,260 --> 01:54:13,740
Oh my God.

3391
01:54:14,100 --> 01:54:14,460
Okay.

3392
01:54:15,040 --> 01:54:20,740
Okay, Lily, put Doki, Jack.

3393
01:54:20,900 --> 01:54:22,500
So it has to be Jack?

3394
01:54:22,660 --> 01:54:24,980
Doki, Jack, and I don't know who the last one is.

3395
01:54:25,060 --> 01:54:25,660
Maybe Tenzin.

3396
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:27,240
Tenzin?

3397
01:54:27,240 --> 01:54:27,360
Tenzin?

3398
01:54:27,360 --> 01:54:28,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3399
01:54:28,340 --> 01:54:29,200
No, no, I think it is.

3400
01:54:29,300 --> 01:54:29,560
I think it is.

3401
01:54:29,860 --> 01:54:30,440
Wait, really?

3402
01:54:32,200 --> 01:54:33,100
Oh my God.

3403
01:54:33,160 --> 01:54:33,940
Guys, it's not me.

3404
01:54:33,940 --> 01:54:34,740
I guess there's one way to find out.

3405
01:54:34,940 --> 01:54:36,360
It's not me, guys.

3406
01:54:38,420 --> 01:54:42,340
If you guys pick me, you're very bad at deduction, guys.

3407
01:54:42,380 --> 01:54:42,980
No, it's not me.

3408
01:54:43,420 --> 01:54:44,100
Pick Doki.

3409
01:54:44,640 --> 01:54:45,020
Who?

3410
01:54:45,320 --> 01:54:45,760
Who?

3411
01:54:46,020 --> 01:54:47,900
I didn't want this end of it, no?

3412
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:49,980
No, oh, no.

3413
01:54:50,200 --> 01:54:54,460
Guys, all I'm saying is that I was just really bad.

3414
01:54:54,600 --> 01:54:57,100
I was just very suspicious and bad at this game.

3415
01:54:57,100 --> 01:54:57,600
This is the end of the game, guys.

3416
01:55:03,700 --> 01:55:06,900
Wait, but then if Jack and Tenzin are the aliens...

3417
01:55:06,900 --> 01:55:07,600
Wait, you guys gotta vote.

3418
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:14,960
The aliens win, but then Jack and Tenzin are on our team, and we'll get more points.

3419
01:55:16,040 --> 01:55:16,840
I don't know.

3420
01:55:16,900 --> 01:55:18,600
I think you should get more points.

3421
01:55:18,620 --> 01:55:19,800
You have to get them all right.

3422
01:55:20,020 --> 01:55:22,300
I think the team thing is making it really hard.

3423
01:55:22,540 --> 01:55:22,980
Yeah.

3424
01:55:23,160 --> 01:55:23,600
Yeah.

3425
01:55:23,720 --> 01:55:25,940
You have a different incentive.

3426
01:55:26,700 --> 01:55:27,560
All right.

3427
01:55:27,640 --> 01:55:29,280
I don't think it was Tenzin.

3428
01:55:29,640 --> 01:55:30,940
See you later, alien scum.

3429
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:31,820
Oh, my God.

3430
01:55:32,140 --> 01:55:32,580
What?

3431
01:55:32,580 --> 01:55:33,720
Doki, it's not you?

3432
01:55:34,440 --> 01:55:35,880
It was never you.

3433
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:36,720
I told you.

3434
01:55:37,240 --> 01:55:39,580
I literally told you guys.

3435
01:55:41,080 --> 01:55:43,080
I knew it was Peter.

3436
01:55:43,480 --> 01:55:44,840
I knew it was Peter.

3437
01:55:46,120 --> 01:55:46,940
See you later.

3438
01:55:47,140 --> 01:55:47,600
One was adjacent.

3439
01:55:48,360 --> 01:55:50,360
I knew it was him, too, but...

3440
01:55:50,360 --> 01:55:51,280
Good job, everyone.

3441
01:55:51,280 --> 01:55:51,620
Good job, everyone.

3442
01:55:52,300 --> 01:55:55,920
My prompt initial, by the way, was what would you describe as mousey?

3443
01:55:55,920 --> 01:55:56,140
Glimpse, dony.

3444
01:55:56,980 --> 01:55:58,120
We did everything.

3445
01:55:58,380 --> 01:56:02,180
Not only did Evan and I win, we got the other alien out that wasn't on our team.

3446
01:56:02,540 --> 01:56:03,040
I fumbled out, huh?

3447
01:56:03,180 --> 01:56:03,740
That's not good.

3448
01:56:04,100 --> 01:56:06,980
Wait, but did we get points because we have?

3449
01:56:06,980 --> 01:56:07,960
We got an alien.

3450
01:56:07,960 --> 01:56:09,060
Doki, why did you get them all wrong?

3451
01:56:09,880 --> 01:56:11,400
You actually knew it for content.

3452
01:56:11,620 --> 01:56:13,820
I knew it.

3453
01:56:13,820 --> 01:56:15,440
Doki's just a content machine, bro.

3454
01:56:15,840 --> 01:56:17,600
I was so clear.

3455
01:56:17,660 --> 01:56:18,400
I was human!

3456
01:56:18,780 --> 01:56:18,900
You were the intimator.

3457
01:56:18,900 --> 01:56:20,360
I was so clear.

3458
01:56:20,580 --> 01:56:21,260
I did not at all.

3459
01:56:21,260 --> 01:56:22,180
You really weren't.

3460
01:56:22,180 --> 01:56:23,300
You really weren't.

3461
01:56:23,300 --> 01:56:24,140
I did not.

3462
01:56:24,160 --> 01:56:25,900
You really weren't clear on it.

3463
01:56:26,540 --> 01:56:29,440
I was like put me in and you can tell I'm human.

3464
01:56:29,760 --> 01:56:31,820
I was like push the button because he's stalling.

3465
01:56:31,860 --> 01:56:33,460
Why are you so sus bro?

3466
01:56:33,620 --> 01:56:34,200
Jesus Christ.

3467
01:56:34,420 --> 01:56:35,440
It's just me.

3468
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:39,040
Like I knew the answers and I'm like Doki is...

3469
01:56:42,100 --> 01:56:43,620
Should have just told me that Tenzin.

3470
01:56:44,240 --> 01:56:46,440
I'm kind of surprised you guys didn't vote for me by the way.

3471
01:56:46,440 --> 01:56:47,840
I'm just naturally suspicious.

3472
01:56:48,240 --> 01:56:49,700
I just wanted to get every alien right.

3473
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:51,940
I just naturally suspicious.

3474
01:56:51,940 --> 01:56:54,040
I was not present in this game I'm gonna be real.

3475
01:56:55,900 --> 01:56:57,160
Yeah she's not an Among Us player.

3476
01:56:57,840 --> 01:57:01,140
Bro and Peter drew that fucking thing on the picture.

3477
01:57:01,240 --> 01:57:02,500
And he's like this is a skeleton.

3478
01:57:02,700 --> 01:57:04,100
I was like there's no way.

3479
01:57:04,600 --> 01:57:06,900
Okay to be honest my prompt was actually correct.

3480
01:57:06,980 --> 01:57:07,900
I didn't know I was hacked.

3481
01:57:08,020 --> 01:57:10,020
I didn't know I was hacked to have a correct prompt.

3482
01:57:10,180 --> 01:57:11,700
I tried to draw something vague.

3483
01:57:13,260 --> 01:57:14,240
Oh that's good.

3484
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:15,580
What is that?

3485
01:57:15,680 --> 01:57:17,520
That was the final game right?

3486
01:57:17,780 --> 01:57:18,180
Hosea.

3487
01:57:18,760 --> 01:57:21,480
That was good.

3488
01:57:23,280 --> 01:57:24,960
Wait so like how are the points done?

3489
01:57:25,080 --> 01:57:25,760
Does that mean like...

3490
01:57:25,900 --> 01:57:30,160
Our team also got points because Tenzin was in the aliens team.

3491
01:57:31,640 --> 01:57:33,240
Like that I don't understand.

3492
01:57:34,160 --> 01:57:35,720
I'm gonna be honest.

3493
01:57:36,440 --> 01:57:39,460
I'm gonna just let God decide because I have no fucking idea.

3494
01:57:39,820 --> 01:57:41,200
Whoever wins good job.

3495
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:42,600
GG's everyone.

3496
01:57:43,520 --> 01:57:44,000
GG's.

3497
01:57:45,500 --> 01:57:46,440
GG's yeah it was fun.

3498
01:57:46,680 --> 01:57:47,400
That's the main thing.

3499
01:57:47,980 --> 01:57:52,540
You know how Dakit almost got me voted out when he was throwing suspicion my way?

3500
01:57:52,620 --> 01:57:54,780
Oh my god yeah I was like wait a second.

3501
01:57:55,960 --> 01:57:56,840
Now Dakit?

3502
01:57:56,920 --> 01:57:57,860
Are you serious?

3503
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:01,700
I'm gonna curse you.

3504
01:58:02,340 --> 01:58:03,840
Yeah you're worse than no teammate.

3505
01:58:04,020 --> 01:58:04,440
I mean what?

3506
01:58:04,600 --> 01:58:04,880
Wait.

3507
01:58:06,580 --> 01:58:08,940
Dakit almost got you called out.

3508
01:58:09,200 --> 01:58:10,040
But you don't mean that.

3509
01:58:11,540 --> 01:58:12,700
Wait take it back.

3510
01:58:12,820 --> 01:58:14,580
No I don't mean that.

3511
01:58:14,640 --> 01:58:16,640
It's not like you almost got me voted out.

3512
01:58:16,760 --> 01:58:17,000
No.

3513
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:20,960
Somebody says I think they lose points because Lily picked the ejection.

3514
01:58:21,060 --> 01:58:22,080
Wait is that how it goes?

3515
01:58:22,480 --> 01:58:22,920
Oh.

3516
01:58:23,660 --> 01:58:24,960
Is that how it works?

3517
01:58:24,960 --> 01:58:25,440
No.

3518
01:58:26,180 --> 01:58:27,100
Surely not right?

3519
01:58:27,200 --> 01:58:28,580
Or somebody says push the button.

3520
01:58:28,780 --> 01:58:28,900
I don't know man.

3521
01:58:28,900 --> 01:58:29,620
Oh my gosh.

3522
01:58:29,660 --> 01:58:31,860
Why do our teams push the button as an individual?

3523
01:58:33,860 --> 01:58:35,480
Wait I didn't know that was an individual.

3524
01:58:36,040 --> 01:58:38,760
Yeah I thought two of my teammates were aliens so I wanted to throw it to them.

3525
01:58:39,160 --> 01:58:39,460
Yeah.

3526
01:58:39,560 --> 01:58:41,260
You were throwing as a human so I was confused.

3527
01:58:41,300 --> 01:58:42,360
Adelki was throwing it herself?

3528
01:58:42,700 --> 01:58:47,280
I told you guys I was really bad at this game.

3529
01:58:47,600 --> 01:58:48,580
I was very clear.

3530
01:58:48,680 --> 01:58:50,320
We were doing bad before they could even hack.

3531
01:58:50,440 --> 01:58:51,380
I could've sworn you out.

3532
01:58:51,480 --> 01:58:52,720
Oh this is so easy.

3533
01:58:52,860 --> 01:58:54,140
There's no way we fucking lose this.

3534
01:58:54,140 --> 01:58:55,540
She says naturally sauce bro.

3535
01:58:55,560 --> 01:58:55,720
Yeah.

3536
01:58:55,940 --> 01:59:02,360
People just think I'm suspicious even though I try to save the game I say push the button because he's stalling.

3537
01:59:04,080 --> 01:59:06,260
What were those bad drawings about then?

3538
01:59:07,320 --> 01:59:08,280
I'm illiterate.

3539
01:59:08,580 --> 01:59:10,020
I thought it was a straw.

3540
01:59:10,720 --> 01:59:11,800
I can't read.

3541
01:59:11,940 --> 01:59:14,020
Because they couldn't even hack yet and you're still doing the prize roll.

3542
01:59:14,020 --> 01:59:16,340
I can't read because it says straw birthday present.

3543
01:59:16,400 --> 01:59:21,780
I was like oh what I won as a birthday gift so then I drew myself holding money because that's what I envisioned.

3544
01:59:23,140 --> 01:59:24,120
Who trolled on us?

3545
01:59:24,120 --> 01:59:24,780
I think you're angry.

3546
01:59:26,400 --> 01:59:28,840
I appreciate the creativity.

3547
01:59:29,120 --> 01:59:30,960
I was just trying to be creative.

3548
01:59:31,580 --> 01:59:32,160
I didn't really.

3549
01:59:32,400 --> 01:59:33,780
You get points for that.

3550
01:59:33,980 --> 01:59:37,020
You did well creativity-wise.

3551
01:59:37,980 --> 01:59:40,240
I like how you had to specify creativity.

3552
01:59:42,760 --> 01:59:45,680
Well good job aliens you really turned that one.

3553
01:59:45,960 --> 01:59:46,900
Honestly that was good.

3554
01:59:47,100 --> 01:59:47,140
Yeah.

3555
01:59:47,640 --> 01:59:52,580
Dude, when Anavan had the fucking chocolate sundae I was like oh it's fucking over.

3556
01:59:52,940 --> 01:59:54,100
My prompt was a cool joke.

3557
01:59:54,100 --> 01:59:58,760
Yeah, it was for sure one, and I had some on Peter, but you're a good liar.

3558
01:59:58,900 --> 02:00:06,440
Yeah, also like, we got, no, we made Peter draw twice, and the first one was when he was like, two people were just standing there.

3559
02:00:07,300 --> 02:00:09,300
It looked like they were fighting.

3560
02:00:09,740 --> 02:00:12,140
I felt like Doki was doing most of the lying for me.

3561
02:00:12,260 --> 02:00:14,320
Like, she just brought all the attention on herself.

3562
02:00:14,440 --> 02:00:14,820
Yeah.

3563
02:00:16,240 --> 02:00:18,780
Let's get our alien prize money, honestly, at this point.

3564
02:00:20,360 --> 02:00:23,520
I was like, damn, dude, Doki's really making my job easy.

3565
02:00:23,520 --> 02:00:24,440
Hell yeah, let's go.

3566
02:00:24,680 --> 02:00:26,360
I should, I wish I was the alien.

3567
02:00:26,640 --> 02:00:26,680
For free?

3568
02:00:26,680 --> 02:00:27,040
For concert?

3569
02:00:28,340 --> 02:00:29,280
Are we done?

3570
02:00:29,580 --> 02:00:30,220
Is that it?

3571
02:00:30,360 --> 02:00:30,800
I think so.

3572
02:00:30,920 --> 02:00:31,880
The other game is still going.

3573
02:00:32,340 --> 02:00:33,300
The other game is still going.

3574
02:00:33,320 --> 02:00:34,920
Oh, who are the aliens over there, I wonder?

3575
02:00:36,180 --> 02:00:37,960
It looks like they're doing the last voting too.

3576
02:00:38,440 --> 02:00:39,100
Oh god.

3577
02:00:39,440 --> 02:00:41,180
Yeah, they have eight seconds left, but it's frozen.

3578
02:00:41,380 --> 02:00:41,860
Oh my god.

3579
02:00:42,540 --> 02:00:43,360
Who is it?

3580
02:00:43,860 --> 02:00:44,600
Who is it?

3581
02:00:44,680 --> 02:00:45,640
Elem Sykkuno.

3582
02:00:45,860 --> 02:00:48,040
Okay, to be honest, Elem could go either way.

3583
02:00:48,480 --> 02:00:51,280
I saw Yvonne go earlier in, but they took her out.

3584
02:00:51,680 --> 02:00:52,780
I would not want to do it.

3585
02:00:52,780 --> 02:00:53,380
No, it's Yvonne.

3586
02:00:53,520 --> 02:00:54,220
Oh, Yvonne.

3587
02:00:54,460 --> 02:00:55,200
Elem Sykkuno.

3588
02:00:55,200 --> 02:00:56,800
Elem and Doki are the same level.

3589
02:00:59,460 --> 02:01:01,500
I hope Elem's also human.

3590
02:01:03,700 --> 02:01:05,200
Doki's saying goodbye to this place.

3591
02:01:06,940 --> 02:01:08,540
Oh my god.

3592
02:01:09,660 --> 02:01:11,580
Wait, are they going to be able to press the button?

3593
02:01:12,660 --> 02:01:15,360
Wait, someone has to push a button right now.

3594
02:01:15,620 --> 02:01:15,760
What are they doing?

3595
02:01:16,300 --> 02:01:17,320
You need to push the button.

3596
02:01:17,500 --> 02:01:19,660
Oh, so aliens won.

3597
02:01:20,820 --> 02:01:22,220
Oh my god, the aliens won.

3598
02:01:22,220 --> 02:01:25,000
Oh, if they voted correctly, they would have won.

3599
02:01:25,220 --> 02:01:25,480
Oh my god.

3600
02:01:25,520 --> 02:01:26,280
Nice wig.

3601
02:01:26,640 --> 02:01:27,820
It was the whole team.

3602
02:01:29,360 --> 02:01:29,800
Oh.

3603
02:01:30,780 --> 02:01:32,260
Nice alien win for them.

3604
02:01:34,300 --> 02:01:35,500
That's your whole team, right?

3605
02:01:35,900 --> 02:01:36,340
Yeah.

3606
02:01:36,500 --> 02:01:36,940
Yeah.

3607
02:01:36,940 --> 02:01:37,160
Yeah.

3608
02:01:37,160 --> 02:01:37,400
Yeah.

3609
02:01:37,400 --> 02:01:37,480
Yeah.

3610
02:01:37,480 --> 02:01:37,620
Yeah.

3611
02:01:37,620 --> 02:01:37,700
Yeah.

3612
02:01:37,700 --> 02:01:37,720
Yeah.

3613
02:01:37,720 --> 02:01:37,760
Yeah.

3614
02:01:37,760 --> 02:01:37,960
Yeah.

3615
02:01:37,960 --> 02:01:37,980
Yeah.

3616
02:01:37,980 --> 02:01:38,140
Yeah.

3617
02:01:38,140 --> 02:01:38,460
Yeah.

3618
02:01:38,460 --> 02:01:38,880
They're the big dudes.

3619
02:01:41,720 --> 02:01:42,840
Oh wow.

3620
02:01:43,200 --> 02:01:43,720
That was great.

3621
02:01:43,940 --> 02:01:48,500
But like, Elem's against Peter for third and fourth place.

3622
02:01:51,440 --> 02:01:54,900
Because Peter was third place and Elem was fourth place.

3623
02:01:55,020 --> 02:01:59,440
So potentially, Elem could be third.

3624
02:01:59,660 --> 02:02:01,120
And then Peter could be last.

3625
02:02:01,700 --> 02:02:02,560
Oh my god.

3626
02:02:02,580 --> 02:02:03,500
We've got this.

3627
02:02:03,560 --> 02:02:04,740
Third place locked in.

3628
02:02:04,840 --> 02:02:05,800
We both won that.

3629
02:02:05,800 --> 02:02:09,700
Listen, we and you won game three and four.

3630
02:02:09,840 --> 02:02:11,740
So if we lose, it's just not on us.

3631
02:02:11,740 --> 02:02:13,200
It's literally just not on us.

3632
02:02:13,360 --> 02:02:14,400
Game two, two.

3633
02:02:14,540 --> 02:02:15,660
I'm not going to say names.

3634
02:02:15,980 --> 02:02:17,180
I'm not naming names.

3635
02:02:17,480 --> 02:02:20,620
I feel like I was doing good in spirit.

3636
02:02:21,720 --> 02:02:22,600
In spirit.

3637
02:02:23,300 --> 02:02:24,840
Maybe in like the Holy Spirit.

3638
02:02:24,980 --> 02:02:26,300
Like you went to church or something.

3639
02:02:26,440 --> 02:02:28,300
Because definitely not in the spirit of this game.

3640
02:02:29,040 --> 02:02:29,480
Thank you, man.

3641
02:02:29,980 --> 02:02:30,420
Damn.

3642
02:02:30,760 --> 02:02:31,440
That's fucked.

3643
02:02:31,640 --> 02:02:32,340
You tried your best.

3644
02:02:32,480 --> 02:02:33,080
You tried your best.

3645
02:02:33,120 --> 02:02:33,820
Your best just wasn't good.

3646
02:02:33,820 --> 02:02:34,200
God, really.

3647
02:02:34,340 --> 02:02:34,620
Honestly.

3648
02:02:34,820 --> 02:02:35,520
Dude, I just...

3649
02:02:35,520 --> 02:02:36,780
You made us look better.

3650
02:02:37,920 --> 02:02:38,400
That's true.

3651
02:02:38,620 --> 02:02:38,920
Yeah.

3652
02:02:39,020 --> 02:02:40,100
I think about my boys, you know.

3653
02:02:40,560 --> 02:02:41,340
Team player.

3654
02:02:41,820 --> 02:02:43,260
You're the support of the team.

3655
02:02:43,660 --> 02:02:44,060
Exactly.

3656
02:02:44,060 --> 02:02:44,600
The moral support.

3657
02:02:46,400 --> 02:02:48,380
Can we move up there and talk to them?

3658
02:02:48,780 --> 02:02:49,460
I think we can.

3659
02:02:50,520 --> 02:02:50,920
Yeah.

3660
02:02:51,080 --> 02:02:51,140
Let's move up.

3661
02:02:51,140 --> 02:02:51,640
Let's move up.

3662
02:02:51,780 --> 02:02:52,040
Yeah.

3663
02:02:52,780 --> 02:02:53,180
Mingle?

3664
02:02:54,120 --> 02:02:55,020
At the end.

3665
02:02:55,400 --> 02:02:56,440
At the end, guys.

3666
02:02:56,600 --> 02:02:57,100
We did it.

3667
02:02:57,120 --> 02:02:57,620
We won.

3668
02:02:57,800 --> 02:02:58,400
We won.

3669
02:02:58,740 --> 02:03:01,180
How do we find out who like wins the whole thing?

3670
02:03:01,600 --> 02:03:02,780
It's on Twitch Rivals.

3671
02:03:02,780 --> 02:03:05,280
I mean, we could just add them and be like, tell us instead of...

3672
02:03:05,620 --> 02:03:07,800
Ellum, they're saying they want an interview with our team.

3673
02:03:08,200 --> 02:03:08,340
Ellum, they want an interview.

3674
02:03:08,340 --> 02:03:09,560
Does that mean we won the whole thing?

3675
02:03:09,660 --> 02:03:09,960
Ellum, go.

3676
02:03:10,140 --> 02:03:10,360
Ellum, go.

3677
02:03:10,500 --> 02:03:11,900
If no, it's my entire team.

3678
02:03:12,800 --> 02:03:13,360
Go, Ellum.

3679
02:03:13,360 --> 02:03:13,500
Go.

3680
02:03:13,600 --> 02:03:14,640
I think we won.

3681
02:03:15,480 --> 02:03:15,840
No.

3682
02:03:16,780 --> 02:03:17,140
No.

3683
02:03:18,280 --> 02:03:19,000
Ellum, go.

3684
02:03:19,080 --> 02:03:20,080
No, no, no, no, no, no.

3685
02:03:20,140 --> 02:03:20,940
Do your interview, man.

3686
02:03:21,060 --> 02:03:21,660
You deserve this.

3687
02:03:21,740 --> 02:03:22,480
Team Ellum, baby.

3688
02:03:22,620 --> 02:03:22,960
Captain.

3689
02:03:23,120 --> 02:03:23,360
Ellum.

3690
02:03:23,980 --> 02:03:24,360
Let's go.

3691
02:03:24,480 --> 02:03:24,840
Captain.

3692
02:03:25,180 --> 02:03:26,520
Number one alien.

3693
02:03:26,980 --> 02:03:27,340
Hey.

3694
02:03:27,560 --> 02:03:28,420
Get in there, man.

3695
02:03:29,440 --> 02:03:31,120
Ellum was not slick with it.

3696
02:03:31,180 --> 02:03:31,500
Number one alien.

3697
02:03:31,500 --> 02:03:31,980
It was definitely nice.

3698
02:03:32,780 --> 02:03:33,400
I was slick with it.

3699
02:03:33,460 --> 02:03:34,520
I was very slick with it.

3700
02:03:34,540 --> 02:03:35,040
Thank you very much.

3701
02:03:35,280 --> 02:03:37,660
I'm surprised that you guys didn't vote out Ellum, like, first night.

3702
02:03:37,820 --> 02:03:38,540
Like, what's happening?

3703
02:03:38,800 --> 02:03:39,600
We were trying to.

3704
02:03:39,740 --> 02:03:40,480
We were trying to.

3705
02:03:40,900 --> 02:03:41,260
Yeah.

3706
02:03:41,360 --> 02:03:42,360
Wait, but who keeps...

3707
02:03:42,360 --> 02:03:44,040
The instructions were...

3708
02:03:44,040 --> 02:03:45,600
The instructions were kind of unclear.

3709
02:03:46,960 --> 02:03:47,460
Wait, what?

3710
02:03:47,740 --> 02:03:49,700
We didn't know if you could...

3711
02:03:49,700 --> 02:03:50,280
We clearly won the game.

3712
02:03:50,340 --> 02:03:50,900
Am I right, boys?

3713
02:03:51,040 --> 02:03:52,700
We didn't know if you could vote people out individually.

3714
02:03:53,580 --> 02:03:53,800
Yeah.

3715
02:03:53,860 --> 02:03:54,460
Could you vote...

3716
02:03:54,460 --> 02:03:54,960
Oh, yeah.

3717
02:03:54,980 --> 02:03:55,760
We didn't know that either.

3718
02:03:55,960 --> 02:03:56,240
Yeah.

3719
02:03:56,280 --> 02:03:58,040
You don't have to vote out three at once.

3720
02:03:58,080 --> 02:03:58,660
Oh, really?

3721
02:03:59,220 --> 02:04:00,560
You could do it individually?

3722
02:04:01,260 --> 02:04:02,760
Oh, we would have done that ages ago.

3723
02:04:02,780 --> 02:04:03,240
Yeah.

3724
02:04:03,240 --> 02:04:04,120
Oh, I didn't know that either.

3725
02:04:04,240 --> 02:04:05,380
I thought I had to vote...

3726
02:04:05,380 --> 02:04:05,920
Yeah.

3727
02:04:06,340 --> 02:04:07,220
For the three people.

3728
02:04:07,820 --> 02:04:09,440
We should call for a rematch.

3729
02:04:09,440 --> 02:04:10,720
Let's just pull onto each other.

3730
02:04:11,260 --> 02:04:11,660
No, no, no.

3731
02:04:11,760 --> 02:04:13,840
You guys would have won that then.

3732
02:04:13,880 --> 02:04:17,440
Someone fucking said, you have to pick all three.

3733
02:04:17,580 --> 02:04:18,560
Someone said those goddamn words.

3734
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:19,120
Who said that?

3735
02:04:19,320 --> 02:04:19,840
Who said that?

3736
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:20,560
I said that, but I...

3737
02:04:21,620 --> 02:04:23,700
I feel like that's correct, but I guess...

3738
02:04:23,700 --> 02:04:24,660
Guys, I'm switching goals.

3739
02:04:24,900 --> 02:04:26,880
Did we win?

3740
02:04:27,260 --> 02:04:28,300
Yeah, I don't know.

3741
02:04:28,360 --> 02:04:28,960
Wait, I don't know.

3742
02:04:28,980 --> 02:04:29,560
Does that mean we won?

3743
02:04:29,620 --> 02:04:30,380
They're calculating it now.

3744
02:04:30,380 --> 02:04:31,580
They're calculating it now.

3745
02:04:31,900 --> 02:04:32,300
Cool.

3746
02:04:32,360 --> 02:04:32,760
Cool.

3747
02:04:32,780 --> 02:04:33,340
I'm punching the numbers.

3748
02:04:33,600 --> 02:04:34,480
In the numbers.

3749
02:04:34,840 --> 02:04:35,760
I've got a good feeling.

3750
02:04:36,120 --> 02:04:36,140
Oh.

3751
02:04:37,420 --> 02:04:38,680
Wait, so who do they want to speak to?

3752
02:04:39,620 --> 02:04:40,020
You.

3753
02:04:40,060 --> 02:04:40,600
Is it everybody?

3754
02:04:40,640 --> 02:04:42,080
They want all of us in there.

3755
02:04:42,100 --> 02:04:43,180
Oh, they want everyone?

3756
02:04:43,400 --> 02:04:43,640
Yeah.

3757
02:04:43,840 --> 02:04:44,340
We all won.

3758
02:04:44,340 --> 02:04:47,100
Surely they can't interview us if we lose the game.

3759
02:04:47,220 --> 02:04:47,800
That would be...

3760
02:04:48,800 --> 02:04:50,140
That would be brutal.

3761
02:04:50,420 --> 02:04:50,800
That would be...

3762
02:04:50,800 --> 02:04:51,540
That would be funny.

3763
02:04:51,900 --> 02:04:52,440
We all won.

3764
02:04:53,300 --> 02:04:56,140
Wait, people in my chat said you have to vote all three.

3765
02:04:57,520 --> 02:04:59,600
My chat said you have to vote for all three.

3766
02:04:59,780 --> 02:05:00,040
Who's lying?

3767
02:05:00,300 --> 02:05:00,620
Who lied?

3768
02:05:01,860 --> 02:05:02,760
Yeah, you have to vote for all three.

3769
02:05:02,760 --> 02:05:02,840
Okay.

3770
02:05:02,840 --> 02:05:03,840
The game's over.

3771
02:05:04,060 --> 02:05:04,940
Why are you lying?

3772
02:05:05,160 --> 02:05:05,580
Yeah.

3773
02:05:07,220 --> 02:05:08,440
Why did you lie?

3774
02:05:09,040 --> 02:05:09,980
Who's the alien?

3775
02:05:10,020 --> 02:05:10,040
Who's the alien?

3776
02:05:10,040 --> 02:05:10,400
It's already over.

3777
02:05:11,060 --> 02:05:11,700
Who's the alien?

3778
02:05:12,480 --> 02:05:12,860
Wait.

3779
02:05:12,960 --> 02:05:13,940
Who of us even just said that?

3780
02:05:14,080 --> 02:05:14,520
It's great.

3781
02:05:14,660 --> 02:05:14,920
Wait.

3782
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:16,260
Did Ellen's team actually win overall?

3783
02:05:16,420 --> 02:05:17,860
I guess because they were all aliens, right?

3784
02:05:18,020 --> 02:05:19,620
So they got all the money.

3785
02:05:19,940 --> 02:05:19,960
Yeah.

3786
02:05:19,960 --> 02:05:21,960
So we probably got like a jillion points.

3787
02:05:22,020 --> 02:05:22,460
Yeah.

3788
02:05:22,480 --> 02:05:22,920
Yeah.

3789
02:05:22,940 --> 02:05:23,500
Because they all...

3790
02:05:23,500 --> 02:05:24,760
That's so RNG.

3791
02:05:25,700 --> 02:05:26,560
Why aren't I where?

3792
02:05:26,760 --> 02:05:28,060
Why aren't you with your team?

3793
02:05:28,140 --> 02:05:29,200
Is it just them?

3794
02:05:29,400 --> 02:05:29,900
What do you mean?

3795
02:05:29,900 --> 02:05:30,480
Where's my team?

3796
02:05:30,520 --> 02:05:32,040
Well, everyone else is down there.

3797
02:05:32,040 --> 02:05:32,240
Yeah.

3798
02:05:33,220 --> 02:05:34,080
No one told me.

3799
02:05:34,300 --> 02:05:35,360
I thought they dragged me.

3800
02:05:35,460 --> 02:05:36,220
Go down there.

3801
02:05:36,300 --> 02:05:36,540
Go.

3802
02:05:37,120 --> 02:05:38,340
Did they forgot about you?

3803
02:05:38,560 --> 02:05:39,700
Like, what happened?

3804
02:05:40,580 --> 02:05:41,660
Did you hear him?

3805
02:05:41,720 --> 02:05:42,880
I thought they were gonna drag me.

3806
02:05:43,380 --> 02:05:43,860
Wait.

3807
02:05:43,880 --> 02:05:44,120
How?

3808
02:05:44,460 --> 02:05:44,940
Oh.

3809
02:05:45,960 --> 02:05:46,640
Bless him.

3810
02:05:47,180 --> 02:05:48,180
Bless his heart.

3811
02:05:48,320 --> 02:05:49,220
Bless his soul.

3812
02:05:50,180 --> 02:05:53,660
I can't believe from one game, they went from fourth to first.

3813
02:05:53,760 --> 02:05:54,220
That's crazy.

3814
02:05:55,080 --> 02:05:56,160
What the fuck?

3815
02:05:57,200 --> 02:06:00,580
Deccan, I just need you to not be last for one of the games, man.

3816
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:02,720
Not last for one of the games.

3817
02:06:04,480 --> 02:06:05,340
You know what?

3818
02:06:05,360 --> 02:06:07,200
He probably did his best, eh?

3819
02:06:08,100 --> 02:06:09,080
Good work, everyone.

3820
02:06:09,380 --> 02:06:09,680
Wait.

3821
02:06:09,780 --> 02:06:10,380
How did Deccan do?

3822
02:06:10,580 --> 02:06:12,520
Deccan even said that he didn't try his best.

3823
02:06:12,760 --> 02:06:13,020
Wait.

3824
02:06:13,100 --> 02:06:13,420
Deccan, I can't keep defending you, man.

3825
02:06:13,480 --> 02:06:14,900
How did Deccan do in the last game?

3826
02:06:15,080 --> 02:06:16,640
How did Deccan do in the last game?

3827
02:06:16,800 --> 02:06:17,140
No.

3828
02:06:17,140 --> 02:06:17,380
Listen.

3829
02:06:17,440 --> 02:06:18,140
I didn't even try.

3830
02:06:18,580 --> 02:06:18,940
No.

3831
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:19,620
I said I was gonna throw.

3832
02:06:19,980 --> 02:06:21,080
Because you were so mean to me.

3833
02:06:21,460 --> 02:06:21,820
What?

3834
02:06:21,960 --> 02:06:22,280
Yeah.

3835
02:06:22,580 --> 02:06:22,940
Oh.

3836
02:06:23,280 --> 02:06:23,640
Oh.

3837
02:06:23,640 --> 02:06:24,560
So you inted on purpose.

3838
02:06:24,640 --> 02:06:25,480
That's bannable, actually.

3839
02:06:25,780 --> 02:06:26,140
Wait.

3840
02:06:26,180 --> 02:06:26,280
Wait.

3841
02:06:26,280 --> 02:06:26,520
No.

3842
02:06:26,680 --> 02:06:27,460
Of course I didn't do that.

3843
02:06:28,400 --> 02:06:28,760
Oh.

3844
02:06:29,400 --> 02:06:30,460
Which one was it, Deccan?

3845
02:06:30,900 --> 02:06:31,340
Uh.

3846
02:06:32,140 --> 02:06:32,840
I just...

3847
02:06:32,840 --> 02:06:34,580
before really poorly, unfortunately.

3848
02:06:35,100 --> 02:06:35,540
Oh.

3849
02:06:36,320 --> 02:06:37,340
At least you're honest.

3850
02:06:37,660 --> 02:06:38,340
You know...

3851
02:06:38,340 --> 02:06:39,340
It happens.

3852
02:06:39,540 --> 02:06:39,980
Yeah.

3853
02:06:39,980 --> 02:06:40,320
I relate.

3854
02:06:41,500 --> 02:06:41,940
Oh?

3855
02:06:41,960 --> 02:06:42,720
We all had fun.

3856
02:06:42,780 --> 02:06:43,600
That's the main thing.

3857
02:06:44,480 --> 02:06:45,880
Not all of us.

3858
02:06:45,880 --> 02:06:46,900
I didn't know how it was this competitive.

3859
02:06:47,140 --> 02:06:47,620
I'm not going to lie.

3860
02:06:47,720 --> 02:06:48,080
I was just...

3861
02:06:48,080 --> 02:06:52,660
Am I drawing nice, friendly, casual game of...?

3862
02:06:52,660 --> 02:06:54,560
And then I got Petr and he just yelled at me.

3863
02:06:54,760 --> 02:06:55,520
And I was like...

3864
02:06:55,960 --> 02:06:59,300
My only goal is not last, man.

3865
02:06:59,440 --> 02:06:59,840
That's ridiculous!

3866
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:00,420
My only goal is not last, man.

3867
02:07:04,420 --> 02:07:08,480
I can't believe though from one game because of RNG.

3868
02:07:09,800 --> 02:07:11,320
Not really.

3869
02:07:12,120 --> 02:07:14,720
I'm thinking that doesn't care about scoreboard and stuff.

3870
02:07:16,180 --> 02:07:18,280
Valorant, Valorant, Valorant.

3871
02:07:18,540 --> 02:07:21,620
Your kid would be in good place.

3872
02:07:22,400 --> 02:07:24,980
Ah, that sounded kinda sarcastic.

3873
02:07:26,220 --> 02:07:26,980
Huh?

3874
02:07:26,980 --> 02:07:27,580
Huh?

3875
02:07:29,160 --> 02:07:29,560
No.

3876
02:07:30,840 --> 02:07:32,200
That sounds sarcastic?

3877
02:07:33,180 --> 02:07:34,000
Oh, you meant it?

3878
02:07:34,280 --> 02:07:38,640
I just had Peter yell at me the whole day so I couldn't tell.

3879
02:07:38,820 --> 02:07:39,980
Oh, oh god.

3880
02:07:40,380 --> 02:07:41,860
Peter, you traumatized the man.

3881
02:07:42,480 --> 02:07:44,140
Dude, okay, grow a sack then.

3882
02:07:44,200 --> 02:07:44,880
Holy shit.

3883
02:07:45,200 --> 02:07:46,600
Yeah, you're right, you're right, you're right.

3884
02:07:47,780 --> 02:07:48,660
Oh my god.

3885
02:07:49,400 --> 02:07:50,680
I'll grow a sack.

3886
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:53,600
No, no, he's right.

3887
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:55,740
I thought you were going to say firm handshake.

3888
02:07:56,060 --> 02:07:56,900
Firm handshake.

3889
02:07:56,980 --> 02:07:57,400
No, he's right.

3890
02:07:57,820 --> 02:07:58,380
He's right.

3891
02:07:58,660 --> 02:07:59,240
Oh my god.

3892
02:07:59,320 --> 02:07:59,760
Okay.

3893
02:08:00,340 --> 02:08:01,760
I'm just going to grow some sacks.

3894
02:08:02,260 --> 02:08:02,700
GG's.

3895
02:08:03,240 --> 02:08:03,840
GG's, Lily.

3896
02:08:04,480 --> 02:08:04,920
GG's.

3897
02:08:05,080 --> 02:08:05,540
Bye bye.

3898
02:08:06,960 --> 02:08:07,700
Bye bye.

3899
02:08:08,720 --> 02:08:09,360
Bye bye.

3900
02:08:09,840 --> 02:08:10,280
Bye bye.

3901
02:08:10,280 --> 02:08:10,360
Bye bye.

3902
02:08:10,360 --> 02:08:11,880
Why does it say Team Elements fourth place?

3903
02:08:12,420 --> 02:08:12,880
Wait, what?

3904
02:08:13,340 --> 02:08:14,080
Oh, it's linked out.

3905
02:08:14,080 --> 02:08:14,360
It's linked.

3906
02:08:14,700 --> 02:08:16,020
Are they still calculating it?

3907
02:08:16,080 --> 02:08:17,540
No, they're still calculating it.

3908
02:08:17,680 --> 02:08:19,180
Yeah, they're probably still calculating it.

3909
02:08:19,180 --> 02:08:22,480
Yeah, but I'm pretty sure they asked them in their team chat that they won.

3910
02:08:23,180 --> 02:08:23,620
Yeah.

3911
02:08:23,720 --> 02:08:26,100
Because, like, three aliens with...

3912
02:08:26,100 --> 02:08:26,660
Wait, we're above?

3913
02:08:27,740 --> 02:08:28,260
No, no, no.

3914
02:08:28,300 --> 02:08:29,180
That's not updated yet, Deccan.

3915
02:08:29,680 --> 02:08:30,000
Oh.

3916
02:08:31,640 --> 02:08:37,000
Yeah, because, like, they all went to, like, the...

3917
02:08:37,400 --> 02:08:38,620
They just wrote that.

3918
02:08:38,680 --> 02:08:41,820
We were 50 points ahead of the last place.

3919
02:08:41,940 --> 02:08:45,300
And then Team Elements just got, like, the most insane aliens.

3920
02:08:45,500 --> 02:08:47,260
Yeah, because all three of them were aliens.

3921
02:08:47,360 --> 02:08:47,800
So they...

3922
02:08:47,800 --> 02:08:49,300
And, like, it's, like, half...

3923
02:08:49,300 --> 02:08:51,400
It's, like, more than half the prize money.

3924
02:08:51,620 --> 02:08:52,220
What part of Young's team, then?

3925
02:08:53,840 --> 02:08:56,060
Yeah, I guess it would be dependent on, like, the other team.

3926
02:08:56,060 --> 02:08:56,080
Yeah, I guess it would be dependent on, like, the other team.

3927
02:08:56,080 --> 02:08:59,100
I don't know their team's performance, but I have a feeling that we're just going to have to...

3928
02:08:59,100 --> 02:09:00,680
I thought the last game...

3929
02:09:00,680 --> 02:09:03,480
I thought the last game was only individual prizing, though.

3930
02:09:03,740 --> 02:09:05,900
Yeah, but they added into the total score.

3931
02:09:06,680 --> 02:09:07,400
Oh, did they?

3932
02:09:07,540 --> 02:09:08,080
Yeah, yeah.

3933
02:09:08,500 --> 02:09:08,940
Oh.

3934
02:09:09,440 --> 02:09:10,200
They're getting, like, kind of...

3935
02:09:10,200 --> 02:09:11,300
How sure are you?

3936
02:09:11,380 --> 02:09:12,400
I feel like you just made that up.

3937
02:09:12,520 --> 02:09:13,840
Well, they took the whole...

3938
02:09:13,840 --> 02:09:16,040
They added a whole team for the interview.

3939
02:09:16,520 --> 02:09:17,520
Teehee didn't actually throw up?

3940
02:09:17,520 --> 02:09:17,760
Teehee?

3941
02:09:19,460 --> 02:09:20,080
Oh, man.

3942
02:09:20,820 --> 02:09:25,760
I assume so, because the whole team's in the interview stage, and they usually interview the winners, right?

3943
02:09:26,180 --> 02:09:27,620
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's team prizing.

3944
02:09:27,780 --> 02:09:28,020
Yeah.

3945
02:09:28,040 --> 02:09:28,240
Yeah, winners.

3946
02:09:28,400 --> 02:09:29,540
Yeah, they just updated it.

3947
02:09:29,660 --> 02:09:30,760
LM's team just won.

3948
02:09:30,900 --> 02:09:31,120
Yeah.

3949
02:09:31,240 --> 02:09:32,180
Oh, there it is.

3950
02:09:32,240 --> 02:09:32,820
There it is.

3951
02:09:33,080 --> 02:09:33,780
Final results, I think.

3952
02:09:34,100 --> 02:09:35,880
That's the most disgusting thing I've ever seen.

3953
02:09:36,060 --> 02:09:36,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3954
02:09:36,540 --> 02:09:37,240
The RNG!

3955
02:09:37,780 --> 02:09:39,160
The fucking RNG!

3956
02:09:39,220 --> 02:09:39,580
Wait, the RNG?

3957
02:09:39,580 --> 02:09:40,000
LM won, I think.

3958
02:09:40,680 --> 02:09:41,040
Wait.

3959
02:09:41,040 --> 02:09:41,380
Oh, that...

3960
02:09:42,340 --> 02:09:43,860
Like, Among Us probably took those.

3961
02:09:43,880 --> 02:09:44,980
We were all the aliens, right?

3962
02:09:45,240 --> 02:09:45,600
Yeah.

3963
02:09:46,260 --> 02:09:46,760
Well, we...

3964
02:09:46,760 --> 02:09:48,300
Like, our game was...

3965
02:09:48,300 --> 02:09:48,360
You were first.

3966
02:09:48,440 --> 02:09:52,100
Our game was weird, because, like, one of our team members was an alien.

3967
02:09:52,400 --> 02:09:52,820
I'm sorry.

3968
02:09:53,020 --> 02:09:54,760
I thought you were an imposter doki.

3969
02:09:54,880 --> 02:09:54,900
Yeah.

3970
02:09:54,920 --> 02:09:55,480
My bad.

3971
02:09:55,620 --> 02:10:00,240
No, even if we won, I think other teams would have won overall, just because, like, they had all three.

3972
02:10:00,520 --> 02:10:01,660
We had more imposters, yeah.

3973
02:10:01,820 --> 02:10:02,020
And then...

3974
02:10:02,020 --> 02:10:02,120
Yeah.

3975
02:10:02,240 --> 02:10:03,400
And we only had one imposter.

3976
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:05,020
We didn't have a chance.

3977
02:10:05,120 --> 02:10:05,840
We didn't have a chance.

3978
02:10:05,860 --> 02:10:06,740
It was just RNG.

3979
02:10:06,960 --> 02:10:07,640
It was RNG.

3980
02:10:07,720 --> 02:10:08,260
It was RNG.

3981
02:10:08,320 --> 02:10:08,500
Yeah.

3982
02:10:08,500 --> 02:10:08,540
Yeah.

3983
02:10:08,540 --> 02:10:09,580
This is not a real...

3984
02:10:09,580 --> 02:10:11,120
It's Jackbox, guys.

3985
02:10:12,020 --> 02:10:12,380
Yeah.

3986
02:10:12,560 --> 02:10:12,920
Yeah.

3987
02:10:12,920 --> 02:10:15,440
Do you guys want to be champions of Jackbox?

3988
02:10:15,940 --> 02:10:16,300
Yes.

3989
02:10:16,320 --> 02:10:17,180
I already am.

3990
02:10:17,500 --> 02:10:19,000
I'll see you in Call of Duty, man.

3991
02:10:21,360 --> 02:10:21,720
Wait.

3992
02:10:21,840 --> 02:10:23,260
So, these are the final results, right?

3993
02:10:23,640 --> 02:10:24,000
Yeah.

3994
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:24,300
I think so.

3995
02:10:24,400 --> 02:10:24,600
Yeah.

3996
02:10:24,600 --> 02:10:27,040
Do me, and then mine, and then Peter, and then Elm.

3997
02:10:27,100 --> 02:10:27,200
Oh!

3998
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:28,000
We got third place!

3999
02:10:28,020 --> 02:10:29,060
We're in third place!

4000
02:10:29,200 --> 02:10:29,520
Let's go.

4001
02:10:29,600 --> 02:10:29,920
Wait.

4002
02:10:29,960 --> 02:10:30,440
Who's last?

4003
02:10:31,400 --> 02:10:31,800
Hey.

4004
02:10:31,880 --> 02:10:32,280
Wait.

4005
02:10:32,320 --> 02:10:33,380
So, victory for us.

4006
02:10:33,380 --> 02:10:33,540
Wait.

4007
02:10:33,600 --> 02:10:34,080
So, individual?

4008
02:10:34,300 --> 02:10:35,480
It was, like, six people?

4009
02:10:35,760 --> 02:10:36,160
Wait.

4010
02:10:36,240 --> 02:10:36,940
So, nothing changed then?

4011
02:10:37,080 --> 02:10:37,360
Wait.

4012
02:10:37,420 --> 02:10:39,280
What the fuck are they interviewing Elm?

4013
02:10:41,460 --> 02:10:44,280
Maybe because all three of them won at the end there.

4014
02:10:44,340 --> 02:10:44,520
Maybe.

4015
02:10:44,600 --> 02:10:44,960
Yeah.

4016
02:10:46,840 --> 02:10:50,820
What if we all just join the interview call and just start talking shit about Elm?

4017
02:10:50,900 --> 02:10:51,300
Yeah.

4018
02:10:51,720 --> 02:10:54,040
Why are you interviewing the last place team?

4019
02:10:54,200 --> 02:10:54,580
I don't know.

4020
02:10:56,640 --> 02:10:57,500
That's all you, Tiger.

4021
02:10:57,640 --> 02:10:58,140
That's all you.

4022
02:10:58,840 --> 02:10:59,960
I take everything back.

4023
02:10:59,980 --> 02:11:00,600
Good job, Ben.

4024
02:11:00,700 --> 02:11:01,440
You did your best.

4025
02:11:01,540 --> 02:11:01,980
Good job.

4026
02:11:02,360 --> 02:11:03,120
Not last, baby.

4027
02:11:03,320 --> 02:11:03,640
Let's go.

4028
02:11:03,660 --> 02:11:04,080
Not last.

4029
02:11:04,260 --> 02:11:04,760
Thank you.

4030
02:11:04,800 --> 02:11:05,300
I appreciate that.

4031
02:11:05,900 --> 02:11:07,100
What does it show the listing?

4032
02:11:07,520 --> 02:11:08,000
You're my goat.

4033
02:11:08,180 --> 02:11:09,100
You're my goat, Dagger.

4034
02:11:09,360 --> 02:11:09,680
Wait.

4035
02:11:09,700 --> 02:11:09,960
Really?

4036
02:11:10,220 --> 02:11:10,680
Yeah, man.

4037
02:11:10,840 --> 02:11:11,340
You're my goat.

4038
02:11:11,560 --> 02:11:12,660
Thank you so much, Mr. PP.

4039
02:11:12,660 --> 02:11:14,680
are my bigger goats, but, like, you're part of the goat pack.

4040
02:11:15,120 --> 02:11:15,440
Okay.

4041
02:11:15,460 --> 02:11:15,580
No.

4042
02:11:15,580 --> 02:11:15,960
I'll take that.

4043
02:11:16,060 --> 02:11:16,380
I'll take that.

4044
02:11:16,400 --> 02:11:17,040
I'm higher up on the mountain.

4045
02:11:18,840 --> 02:11:21,400
technically, because, like, she did throw for us.

4046
02:11:22,480 --> 02:11:22,800
Yeah.

4047
02:11:22,920 --> 02:11:23,180
Yeah.

4048
02:11:24,480 --> 02:11:27,540
It's in the Twitch Rivals link they sent us.

4049
02:11:28,280 --> 02:11:29,180
And then...

4050
02:11:31,540 --> 02:11:34,480
Family game night presented by Mythwalker.

4051
02:11:34,780 --> 02:11:36,060
Like, this, like, at the top.

4052
02:11:36,360 --> 02:11:37,700
There's two things you can press on.

4053
02:11:38,880 --> 02:11:46,680
Basically, individual scoring is just going to be the six people that won as aliens in the games.

4054
02:11:47,740 --> 02:11:48,320
You're welcome, Tiger.

4055
02:11:48,560 --> 02:11:48,620
Wait.

4056
02:11:48,620 --> 02:11:49,420
After the link and then what?

4057
02:11:49,640 --> 02:11:50,320
Yeah, but...

4058
02:11:52,220 --> 02:11:53,160
I'm just sad.

4059
02:11:53,180 --> 02:11:53,840
It's at the top.

4060
02:11:53,880 --> 02:11:55,020
It's at the very top.

4061
02:11:55,160 --> 02:11:56,260
It says Family Game Night.

4062
02:11:56,400 --> 02:11:57,860
Individual prize and then...

4063
02:11:57,860 --> 02:11:58,640
Six people.

4064
02:11:59,900 --> 02:12:01,040
Individually, there's a six-way tie.

4065
02:12:01,160 --> 02:12:01,740
Yeah, yeah.

4066
02:12:01,980 --> 02:12:04,560
Wait, that's for push the button, though.

4067
02:12:04,560 --> 02:12:04,940
Not for...

4068
02:12:04,940 --> 02:12:05,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4069
02:12:05,700 --> 02:12:06,000
So...

4070
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:06,860
What the fuck?

4071
02:12:06,880 --> 02:12:07,520
Then, like...

4072
02:12:07,520 --> 02:12:11,700
Peter and Tenzin should be in that interview as well!

4073
02:12:11,960 --> 02:12:13,160
You guys won with them!

4074
02:12:17,060 --> 02:12:19,180
They weren't you guys in the interview.

4075
02:12:19,620 --> 02:12:20,920
It is what it is.

4076
02:12:22,260 --> 02:12:24,040
Maybe they just wanted to interview the losers.

4077
02:12:24,760 --> 02:12:25,360
That's true!

4078
02:12:25,440 --> 02:12:26,500
They wanted to make them feel better!

4079
02:12:26,940 --> 02:12:27,920
For being last!

4080
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:32,220
Like, they had such a great performance, and it didn't matter at all.

4081
02:12:32,680 --> 02:12:33,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4082
02:12:33,700 --> 02:12:34,380
In the end...

4083
02:12:34,380 --> 02:12:36,660
I honestly am genuinely so confused.

4084
02:12:36,820 --> 02:12:37,540
I don't know.

4085
02:12:37,600 --> 02:12:38,500
Are these standings correct?

4086
02:12:38,620 --> 02:12:39,940
Because I feel like the points didn't change.

4087
02:12:40,720 --> 02:12:41,800
Yeah, I'm kind of wondering.

4088
02:12:42,700 --> 02:12:46,460
I remember being 50 points ahead of Team LM before.

4089
02:12:46,960 --> 02:12:49,560
And it still says we're 50 points ahead of LM.

4090
02:12:49,600 --> 02:12:50,680
I'm pretty sure.

4091
02:12:50,680 --> 02:12:53,380
Well, I don't think the last game counted towards the total points.

4092
02:12:53,540 --> 02:12:54,800
Yeah, I think it's an individual.

4093
02:12:54,820 --> 02:12:56,440
Because the last game was for individual prizing.

4094
02:12:56,440 --> 02:12:56,880
Yeah.

4095
02:12:57,100 --> 02:12:58,500
Oh, okay.

4096
02:12:59,420 --> 02:13:00,420
That makes sense, yeah.

4097
02:13:00,820 --> 02:13:01,380
Okay, wait.

4098
02:13:02,120 --> 02:13:04,080
I'm not gonna pretend like I get that.

4099
02:13:04,140 --> 02:13:04,360
What?

4100
02:13:04,460 --> 02:13:06,900
So, in the end, Peter, you're not last.

4101
02:13:07,080 --> 02:13:07,920
It's LM's team.

4102
02:13:07,960 --> 02:13:10,960
Because the last round did not count as a team result.

4103
02:13:11,600 --> 02:13:13,980
So, in the end, Sykkuno should...

4104
02:13:13,980 --> 02:13:14,420
Wait, no.

4105
02:13:14,440 --> 02:13:15,640
Sykkuno was an alien, so...

4106
02:13:15,640 --> 02:13:19,060
How would they count the last game as, like...

4107
02:13:19,520 --> 02:13:20,560
As, like, a team result.

4108
02:13:21,840 --> 02:13:22,920
Yeah, because, like...

4109
02:13:22,920 --> 02:13:25,300
Because it's random who gets alien and who gets human, right?

4110
02:13:25,300 --> 02:13:25,580
Yeah, it's clearly RNG.

4111
02:13:25,940 --> 02:13:29,820
So, it's only for whoever wins as, like, aliens.

4112
02:13:30,300 --> 02:13:30,740
Yeah.

4113
02:13:31,060 --> 02:13:32,480
Wait, how did Tenzin...

4114
02:13:32,480 --> 02:13:33,740
Or wins as humans.

4115
02:13:34,180 --> 02:13:35,540
Wait, why doesn't Tenzin win?

4116
02:13:35,760 --> 02:13:37,420
Yeah, didn't Tenzin get voted out?

4117
02:13:37,460 --> 02:13:38,980
Yeah, but she's part of the alien team.

4118
02:13:39,200 --> 02:13:41,340
So, because you guys won, she takes the win.

4119
02:13:41,500 --> 02:13:43,520
Because not all of you guys got voted out.

4120
02:13:43,840 --> 02:13:44,280
Yeah.

4121
02:13:44,360 --> 02:13:44,560
Yeah.

4122
02:13:44,920 --> 02:13:45,860
Tenzin was the alien.

4123
02:13:46,020 --> 02:13:46,420
Yeah.

4124
02:13:46,660 --> 02:13:46,680
I'm joking.

4125
02:13:47,540 --> 02:13:48,480
Take it out, Sykkuno.

4126
02:13:48,480 --> 02:13:49,040
Peter, are you serious?

4127
02:13:50,880 --> 02:13:53,300
I just came back because I just heard what you said.

4128
02:13:53,640 --> 02:13:54,460
I'm being real.

4129
02:13:54,860 --> 02:13:55,600
I only remember the end of it.

4130
02:13:55,600 --> 02:13:56,600
I thought you were actually...

4131
02:13:56,600 --> 02:13:58,000
I thought you were, like, building it up for me.

4132
02:13:58,040 --> 02:13:59,260
And then you, kind of, bailed me out.

4133
02:13:59,320 --> 02:14:00,740
I was like, oh, that was really smart, Peter.

4134
02:14:00,780 --> 02:14:01,300
You, fuck!

4135
02:14:02,780 --> 02:14:04,340
I didn't even realize.

4136
02:14:05,040 --> 02:14:06,700
They didn't even realize you were the alien.

4137
02:14:07,320 --> 02:14:07,920
Listen, listen.

4138
02:14:08,400 --> 02:14:09,980
Maybe I remembered at the time.

4139
02:14:10,040 --> 02:14:11,920
But right now, nothing's sticking.

4140
02:14:12,840 --> 02:14:13,200
Hey.

4141
02:14:14,280 --> 02:14:15,140
That's my bad, bro.

4142
02:14:15,180 --> 02:14:16,160
Welcome back, guys.

4143
02:14:16,880 --> 02:14:17,240
Yeah.

4144
02:14:17,440 --> 02:14:18,920
Apparently, we won the whole thing.

4145
02:14:18,920 --> 02:14:20,260
Thanks to that one last round.

4146
02:14:20,480 --> 02:14:21,160
Wait, really?

4147
02:14:21,260 --> 02:14:22,980
We were in the literal last place.

4148
02:14:22,980 --> 02:14:24,000
We had triple aliens.

4149
02:14:24,420 --> 02:14:27,440
Yeah, we were in the last place, but the triple aliens were not updated.

4150
02:14:27,820 --> 02:14:30,700
Yeah, because the website says you're last.

4151
02:14:30,720 --> 02:14:31,320
The website's wrong, then.

4152
02:14:31,420 --> 02:14:32,720
Yeah, it says you guys are still last.

4153
02:14:33,100 --> 02:14:35,400
I think because they didn't update for that one.

4154
02:14:35,400 --> 02:14:36,080
They didn't update it, yeah.

4155
02:14:36,380 --> 02:14:38,260
I feel like you guys are going to have to do some live.

4156
02:14:38,500 --> 02:14:39,640
I can't take it anymore.

4157
02:14:39,960 --> 02:14:40,960
Everyone in our lobby.

4158
02:14:41,060 --> 02:14:44,860
Did you know that Sykkuno didn't know that he was an alien the whole time?

4159
02:14:44,860 --> 02:14:48,740
I missed the screen that told me, like, who the other aliens were and stuff.

4160
02:14:48,740 --> 02:14:49,980
So I was just playing the game.

4161
02:14:50,040 --> 02:14:50,780
Wait, what are you missing?

4162
02:14:50,800 --> 02:14:51,380
That's a confirm.

4163
02:14:51,540 --> 02:14:52,660
He didn't see it.

4164
02:14:52,680 --> 02:14:53,980
I just didn't straight up see it.

4165
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,100
I think he was supposed to tell me who the other aliens were at some point.

4166
02:14:56,120 --> 02:14:56,300
It did, yeah.

4167
02:14:56,300 --> 02:14:57,340
Oh, the points.

4168
02:14:57,340 --> 02:14:58,540
I never saw that.

4169
02:14:58,680 --> 02:14:59,080
It never...

4170
02:14:59,080 --> 02:15:05,680
The points is literally just, like, one to one dollar value.

4171
02:15:06,600 --> 02:15:07,080
Oh.

4172
02:15:07,140 --> 02:15:07,460
Yeah.

4173
02:15:07,600 --> 02:15:08,020
Oh.

4174
02:15:08,580 --> 02:15:09,060
Wow.

4175
02:15:09,620 --> 02:15:11,220
Okay, so in the end...

4176
02:15:11,220 --> 02:15:17,960
So because LM's team had three aliens that won, it boosted their points up by, like, 900.

4177
02:15:19,380 --> 02:15:20,800
What the f**k?

4178
02:15:21,320 --> 02:15:21,400
What the f**k?

4179
02:15:21,880 --> 02:15:22,260
Dang.

4180
02:15:23,660 --> 02:15:24,760
We needed that.

4181
02:15:25,140 --> 02:15:25,560
That's crazy.

4182
02:15:25,560 --> 02:15:25,640
That's crazy.

4183
02:15:25,980 --> 02:15:26,360
Damn.

4184
02:15:27,200 --> 02:15:27,880
I mean, wait.

4185
02:15:27,960 --> 02:15:31,280
How is it, like, the last game basically is what matters?

4186
02:15:31,400 --> 02:15:34,500
Yeah, your team got 840 points for the last game.

4187
02:15:34,680 --> 02:15:37,140
Because I'm assuming you guys had two aliens, right?

4188
02:15:37,200 --> 02:15:37,720
Yes, yes.

4189
02:15:37,840 --> 02:15:38,120
Two aliens.

4190
02:15:38,300 --> 02:15:38,640
Yeah.

4191
02:15:38,980 --> 02:15:39,020
Yeah.

4192
02:15:39,020 --> 02:15:40,300
Are these standings correct?

4193
02:15:40,400 --> 02:15:41,080
I'm so confused.

4194
02:15:41,100 --> 02:15:41,600
No, no, no, no.

4195
02:15:41,600 --> 02:15:43,280
They just showed it on Rivals.

4196
02:15:43,480 --> 02:15:44,320
They just showed it on Rivals.

4197
02:15:44,500 --> 02:15:44,820
Oh, yeah.

4198
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:45,720
Are we last?

4199
02:15:45,720 --> 02:15:47,020
That's the main thing we're worried about.

4200
02:15:47,080 --> 02:15:47,920
Are we at least the highest?

4201
02:15:47,920 --> 02:15:48,220
Are we at least the highest?

4202
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:49,660
No, no, no.

4203
02:15:49,660 --> 02:15:51,840
No, I think we were last.

4204
02:15:52,100 --> 02:15:53,420
Yeah, Team A was last.

4205
02:15:54,140 --> 02:15:55,300
Yeah, Team A was last.

4206
02:15:55,620 --> 02:15:55,780
Wait, who's third?

4207
02:15:55,780 --> 02:15:56,360
Are we third then?

4208
02:15:56,920 --> 02:15:57,700
Oh, we're third?

4209
02:15:57,760 --> 02:15:58,040
Oh, my God.

4210
02:15:58,300 --> 02:15:59,300
Oh, we're not last.

4211
02:15:59,340 --> 02:15:59,900
I think I...

4212
02:16:00,260 --> 02:16:01,260
I'm going to be honest, guys.

4213
02:16:01,580 --> 02:16:02,500
Wait, no, we're second!

4214
02:16:02,760 --> 02:16:05,980
I sacked with my team because we didn't want LM to get last again and feel bad.

4215
02:16:06,080 --> 02:16:06,980
I was like, what do you mean?

4216
02:16:07,220 --> 02:16:07,840
I was better.

4217
02:16:08,100 --> 02:16:08,520
I was better.

4218
02:16:08,780 --> 02:16:12,180
Yeah, honestly, this is the kind of stuff I do.

4219
02:16:12,200 --> 02:16:13,940
This is the kind of s**t I do for the homies, you know?

4220
02:16:14,020 --> 02:16:14,400
Wait, really?

4221
02:16:14,880 --> 02:16:15,200
Oh, yeah.

4222
02:16:15,200 --> 02:16:15,580
That's my guy.

4223
02:16:15,720 --> 02:16:17,320
This is the kind of guy that I am.

4224
02:16:19,020 --> 02:16:20,400
Wait, I have the standings.

4225
02:16:20,400 --> 02:16:21,220
I posted in chat.

4226
02:16:21,480 --> 02:16:23,300
This is the final standings.

4227
02:16:23,580 --> 02:16:24,460
Oh, I see.

4228
02:16:24,760 --> 02:16:24,800
Yeah.

4229
02:16:25,720 --> 02:16:26,160
Yeah.

4230
02:16:26,840 --> 02:16:29,540
Look at how much money they got.

4231
02:16:29,940 --> 02:16:31,180
LM's team got...

4232
02:16:31,640 --> 02:16:32,940
That's a lot of money.

4233
02:16:33,480 --> 02:16:34,480
Okay, I'm going to be honest.

4234
02:16:34,600 --> 02:16:37,200
We all kind of made around the same amount of money.

4235
02:16:37,200 --> 02:16:37,220
$4,000.

4236
02:16:37,220 --> 02:16:37,480
The same.

4237
02:16:37,500 --> 02:16:37,880
Yeah.

4238
02:16:38,560 --> 02:16:38,760
Yeah.

4239
02:16:39,140 --> 02:16:39,200
Yeah.

4240
02:16:39,200 --> 02:16:40,000
I'm going to be narrow on that.

4241
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:41,200
Honestly, it kind of worked out.

4242
02:16:41,280 --> 02:16:42,980
Honestly, that was really close.

4243
02:16:43,420 --> 02:16:44,600
Yeah, that was really close.

4244
02:16:44,740 --> 02:16:46,980
Wait, do you guys get medals for family?

4245
02:16:47,180 --> 02:16:47,300
Yeah.

4246
02:16:47,320 --> 02:16:47,540
Did you?

4247
02:16:47,740 --> 02:16:48,440
Oh, yeah.

4248
02:16:48,480 --> 02:16:49,020
That would be awesome.

4249
02:16:49,660 --> 02:16:50,100
Nope.

4250
02:16:50,480 --> 02:16:50,920
Oh.

4251
02:16:50,960 --> 02:16:51,400
Oh.

4252
02:16:52,860 --> 02:16:54,160
Not competitive enough.

4253
02:16:54,280 --> 02:16:54,740
I'm sorry.

4254
02:16:58,740 --> 02:16:59,880
Oh, good games, everybody.

4255
02:17:00,060 --> 02:17:00,560
Good games.

4256
02:17:00,640 --> 02:17:00,860
Yeah.

4257
02:17:00,860 --> 02:17:03,320
You guys, congrats on having the best family.

4258
02:17:03,700 --> 02:17:03,840
Yeah.

4259
02:17:04,260 --> 02:17:04,700
GG.

4260
02:17:05,640 --> 02:17:06,080
GG.

4261
02:17:06,720 --> 02:17:07,160
GG.

4262
02:17:07,160 --> 02:17:07,480
GG.

4263
02:17:07,480 --> 02:17:07,760
GG.

4264
02:17:08,180 --> 02:17:08,620
GG.

4265
02:17:08,620 --> 02:17:08,740
GG.

4266
02:17:08,740 --> 02:17:08,800
GG.

4267
02:17:08,800 --> 02:17:08,860
GG.

4268
02:17:08,860 --> 02:17:08,980
GG.

4269
02:17:09,480 --> 02:17:09,920
GG.

4270
02:17:10,620 --> 02:17:11,060
GG.

4271
02:17:11,060 --> 02:17:11,440
GG.

4272
02:17:14,700 --> 02:17:15,140
GG.

4273
02:17:15,140 --> 02:17:15,320
Thank you, guys.

4274
02:17:15,880 --> 02:17:16,620
See you guys.

4275
02:17:18,180 --> 02:17:18,660
Hello?

4276
02:17:19,640 --> 02:17:21,180
Hello, what are you doing up there?

4277
02:17:21,620 --> 02:17:25,420
I have to warm up for street fighter.

4278
02:17:25,660 --> 02:17:26,060
Why?

4279
02:17:27,080 --> 02:17:28,040
Warm up.

4280
02:17:28,360 --> 02:17:28,860
Not warm up.

4281
02:17:28,940 --> 02:17:29,300
Practice.

4282
02:17:29,380 --> 02:17:29,860
Sorry.

4283
02:17:30,060 --> 02:17:31,960
Because my coach is actually available.

4284
02:17:34,180 --> 02:17:36,120
Because he has a job.

4285
02:17:36,400 --> 02:17:36,740
Wait.

4286
02:17:37,980 --> 02:17:38,460
Why?

4287
02:17:38,660 --> 02:17:40,400
Were you trying to ask me to play Vallorant?

4288
02:17:41,220 --> 02:17:41,700
No.

4289
02:17:41,980 --> 02:17:43,000
You were trying...

4290
02:17:43,580 --> 02:17:45,120
You wanted to ask me to play?

4291
02:17:45,120 --> 02:17:45,980
You didn't play Valorant, didn't you?

4292
02:17:46,060 --> 02:17:47,700
No, I'm playing Minecraft right now.

4293
02:17:47,760 --> 02:17:49,440
I wanted to see if you wanted to look at my Minecraft.

4294
02:17:50,300 --> 02:17:50,900
Playing what?

4295
02:17:53,180 --> 02:17:53,900
What do you mean?

4296
02:17:54,640 --> 02:18:00,920
I wanted to see if you wanted to look at Minecraft a little and play on my server for a tiny bit for like a one day pass.

4297
02:18:01,740 --> 02:18:04,360
But like, I didn't know you didn't like me that much.

4298
02:18:04,560 --> 02:18:05,780
What do you mean?

4299
02:18:06,820 --> 02:18:07,860
That's guilt tripping.

4300
02:18:09,420 --> 02:18:11,660
I was offering a simple Minecraft.

4301
02:18:11,680 --> 02:18:12,900
You're like, you just want to play Valorant.

4302
02:18:13,660 --> 02:18:14,640
That's all you want to do?

4303
02:18:14,800 --> 02:18:14,920
Every time!

4304
02:18:14,920 --> 02:18:16,640
It's a pattern and you know it!

4305
02:18:16,700 --> 02:18:17,200
Every time!

4306
02:18:17,280 --> 02:18:18,660
After, after...

4307
02:18:19,480 --> 02:18:21,060
You'd be like, Valorant!

4308
02:18:22,220 --> 02:18:25,820
But like, I wanted to show you how cute my house was.

4309
02:18:26,120 --> 02:18:26,740
You want...

4310
02:18:27,520 --> 02:18:28,420
It's a trap!

4311
02:18:28,460 --> 02:18:31,760
You wanted me to not practice Dream Fighters so tomorrow...

4312
02:18:31,760 --> 02:18:33,300
No, I'm not practicing either!

4313
02:18:34,140 --> 02:18:35,600
Wait, why aren't you practicing?

4314
02:18:37,280 --> 02:18:39,340
Wait, look.

4315
02:18:39,500 --> 02:18:40,300
I'm screen sharing.

4316
02:18:41,560 --> 02:18:42,380
Isn't this cute?

4317
02:18:43,720 --> 02:18:44,500
Oh, that's cute.

4318
02:18:45,480 --> 02:18:54,200
Also, chat, even if like, even if like, um, humans won in our lobby, Ellum's team would have still been first because they had three aliens.

4319
02:18:55,620 --> 02:18:56,060
Yeah.

4320
02:18:56,280 --> 02:19:02,320
Like, even if we had like, like, because it's like, what, three, um, Ellum's team would have still won.

4321
02:19:11,120 --> 02:19:13,000
So you don't want to play Minecraft?

4322
02:19:18,080 --> 02:19:19,260
I can't, Gumi.

4323
02:19:19,300 --> 02:19:21,240
I actually have to practice, Gumi.

4324
02:19:22,020 --> 02:19:25,180
We can play Minecraft after Street Fighter.

4325
02:19:26,120 --> 02:19:26,720
Promise?

4326
02:19:26,940 --> 02:19:28,120
Yeah, I promise.

4327
02:19:28,220 --> 02:19:30,160
We'll play Minecraft after Street Fighter.

4328
02:19:31,120 --> 02:19:32,840
I... I can't.

4329
02:19:32,840 --> 02:19:39,740
I... My coach... My coach is... is not a degenerate like me, so it's so hard to get coaching.

4330
02:19:40,500 --> 02:19:41,660
Ah, I see.

4331
02:19:42,880 --> 02:19:44,500
Okay, if you say so.

4332
02:19:45,560 --> 02:19:46,520
Alright, Gumi.

4333
02:19:46,620 --> 02:19:47,920
After Street Fighter, okay?

4334
02:19:48,020 --> 02:19:49,240
Or like, Saturday.

4335
02:19:49,560 --> 02:19:49,620
She called me.

4336
02:19:49,620 --> 02:19:51,520
Wait, do I have anything on Saturday?

4337
02:19:51,840 --> 02:19:53,340
Wait, weren't we supposed to do Saturday?

4338
02:19:54,100 --> 02:19:56,660
Yeah, we were, but then the Street Fighter shit happened.

4339
02:19:57,420 --> 02:19:58,280
So like, I can't.

4340
02:19:58,280 --> 02:19:59,240
Yeah, we need to decide on a date.

4341
02:20:01,060 --> 02:20:01,460
Uh...

4342
02:20:02,400 --> 02:20:03,400
Wait, decide what?

4343
02:20:04,840 --> 02:20:05,700
On a date.

4344
02:20:05,740 --> 02:20:06,380
To do the date.

4345
02:20:06,720 --> 02:20:07,440
Oh, the thing.

4346
02:20:07,460 --> 02:20:08,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4347
02:20:08,560 --> 02:20:08,980
We will.

4348
02:20:09,140 --> 02:20:12,440
I just haven't had time to get the new date because of the Seijan Slam.

4349
02:20:13,160 --> 02:20:13,560
Yeah.

4350
02:20:14,500 --> 02:20:14,900
Yeah.

4351
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:16,600
Alright, Gigi, Gumi.

4352
02:20:16,880 --> 02:20:18,440
Gigi, have fun in Minecraft.

4353
02:20:18,440 --> 02:20:18,800
Okay, baby.

4354
02:20:21,780 --> 02:20:23,160
Alright, bye-bye.

4355
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:24,740
Bye-bye.

4356
02:20:24,780 --> 02:20:26,460
Thanks for the invite, Gumi.

4357
02:20:27,040 --> 02:20:27,600
Bye-bye.

4358
02:20:27,600 --> 02:20:28,420
Bye-bye.

4359
02:20:28,860 --> 02:20:29,600
Love you.

4360
02:20:29,740 --> 02:20:30,200
Bye-bye.

4361
02:20:30,240 --> 02:20:30,540
Bye-bye.

4362
02:20:31,380 --> 02:20:32,100
Stay back!

4363
02:20:40,870 --> 02:20:41,430
Alright.

4364
02:20:41,850 --> 02:20:42,310
Alright!

4365
02:20:42,990 --> 02:20:47,010
Welcome to the... We got that surprise stream, everybody.

4366
02:20:47,470 --> 02:20:49,870
We got the surprise stream.

4367
02:20:51,910 --> 02:20:53,350
I wasn't going to say.

4368
02:20:53,730 --> 02:20:56,990
But yeah, that was a crazy game.

4369
02:20:57,190 --> 02:20:59,470
I did not like the last game, I swear.

4370
02:20:59,590 --> 02:21:02,390
The last game was so fucked.

4371
02:21:04,330 --> 02:21:08,890
That was like, it was super fucked, I feel like, the last game.

4372
02:21:09,890 --> 02:21:15,030
Just because of the fact that like, it was, I feel like it was alien-sided.

4373
02:21:15,690 --> 02:21:19,230
I feel like it was alien-sided in general.

4374
02:21:19,230 --> 02:21:25,330
Like, even if I wasn't super suspicious, the game was heavily alien-sided, not huge.

4375
02:21:25,470 --> 02:21:31,610
Like, it was just... I had... I was sussing out, like, Peter and Tenzin.

4376
02:21:32,370 --> 02:21:35,610
But then I was like, this is a weird game.

4377
02:21:36,230 --> 02:21:37,490
It is weird.

4378
02:21:38,310 --> 02:21:44,370
It was... I was like, this is really difficult because you have to make three correct...

4379
02:21:44,370 --> 02:21:45,830
But like, yeah, but it's alright.

4380
02:21:45,930 --> 02:21:47,410
We got second place in the end.

4381
02:21:47,550 --> 02:21:48,790
We were in the lead.

4382
02:21:48,850 --> 02:21:49,070
Yeah.

4383
02:21:49,070 --> 02:21:51,590
We were in the lead.

4384
02:21:55,150 --> 02:21:55,950
Yeah.

4385
02:21:57,890 --> 02:22:00,330
Yeah, but then I was just naturally suspicious.

4386
02:22:00,750 --> 02:22:05,510
I feel like even if I wasn't naturally suspicious, I had no...

4387
02:22:05,510 --> 02:22:09,210
I felt like it was very difficult to figure it...

4388
02:22:09,210 --> 02:22:15,610
Like, have everybody unified in figuring out the three aliens.

4389
02:22:17,710 --> 02:22:19,510
But yeah, that was fun.

4390
02:22:19,770 --> 02:22:21,470
Thank you to Gumi for inviting me.

4391
02:22:21,550 --> 02:22:22,750
I had a really good time.

4392
02:22:23,050 --> 02:22:24,610
It was really fun interacting with everybody.

4393
02:22:24,890 --> 02:22:26,750
I'm really sorry if...

4394
02:22:26,750 --> 02:22:29,810
I'm really sorry if like...

4395
02:22:31,030 --> 02:22:36,950
If the sound balancing was really bad because my sound...

4396
02:22:36,950 --> 02:22:40,750
This was a super last minute stream and my sound guy was not awake at that time.

4397
02:22:40,930 --> 02:22:41,210
So...

4398
02:22:41,210 --> 02:22:42,190
So...

4399
02:22:42,190 --> 02:22:44,750
I hope the audio balancing for...

4400
02:22:45,350 --> 02:22:46,730
Everybody was okay.

4401
02:22:46,870 --> 02:22:48,930
I know it wasn't perfect, but...

4402
02:22:49,910 --> 02:22:51,510
I hope it was decent.

4403
02:22:53,070 --> 02:22:53,950
Anyway, guys.

4404
02:22:54,530 --> 02:22:55,550
I had a great time.

4405
02:22:55,710 --> 02:22:56,910
As always, everybody, stay hydrated.

4406
02:22:57,470 --> 02:22:59,130
Pause to check it up and move around to get that blood flowing.

4407
02:22:59,210 --> 02:22:59,670
Stay up for me.

4408
02:22:59,750 --> 02:23:00,270
Head to bed.

4409
02:23:00,390 --> 02:23:01,410
Because you deserve it.

4410
02:23:01,530 --> 02:23:03,830
If you guys are new around here, my name is Doki Bird.

4411
02:23:03,950 --> 02:23:05,790
I usually stream on the YouTube.

4412
02:23:06,470 --> 02:23:09,710
But today, I am on Twitch because of Twitch Rivals.

4413
02:23:09,810 --> 02:23:11,650
So please check me out on the YouTubes.

4414
02:23:11,710 --> 02:23:13,150
And follow me on Twitter.

4415
02:23:13,270 --> 02:23:14,730
Because I usually talk about when I'm on Twitch.

4416
02:23:14,730 --> 02:23:15,430
I'm live on Twitter.

4417
02:23:15,610 --> 02:23:19,330
If you want to support me via other means, I do have other means of supporting.

4418
02:23:19,530 --> 02:23:20,510
Like the gamer subcode.

4419
02:23:20,730 --> 02:23:22,610
The Hyatt merch and everything.

4420
02:23:22,850 --> 02:23:23,650
The voice packs.

4421
02:23:24,090 --> 02:23:25,570
So check out my merch there.

4422
02:23:25,850 --> 02:23:27,270
And I want to see you guys later.

4423
02:23:27,370 --> 02:23:29,950
I need to feed my dog and walk him now.

4424
02:23:30,070 --> 02:23:30,650
Bye, everybody.

4425
02:23:31,030 --> 02:23:31,630
Bye-bye.
