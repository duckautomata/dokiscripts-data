00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,040
Hello, everybody.

2
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,100
Hello, hello.

3
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,200
I'm a little, a little eepy today.

4
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,000
So, um, it'll be, I'm waiting for my coffee to kick in.

5
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,840
And that's why I sound very, well, it has to be very, there you go.

6
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:00,220
Hello.

7
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,780
Now, now it's immersive.

8
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,100
But, um, I'm very tired today.

9
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,160
Uh, so I'm just waiting for my coffee to kick in.

10
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,140
I actually ordered a 20.

11
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:40,460
20 ounce i ordered 20 ounce for my caramel latte because i know i i need this like i i really really need this right now i am not okay at the moment so um i ordered 20 yeah the big boy the big boy drink the 20 ounce of coffee um so i'm hoping it'll kick in soon um but yes for those

12
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:49,360
Sorry, my brain is very slow right now, so it's going to take a while for me to formulate my sentences.

13
00:02:51,620 --> 00:03:06,500
But the reason why I'm very EPI is because today, starting at 3 a.m., I was doing Vexpo, which is a VTuber convention in the UK in Birmingham.

14
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:12,860
And because of that, my panel started at 3 in the morning.

15
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:21,980
And my meeting group started at, well, my meeting group was supposed to start at five.

16
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,820
You know, it was supposed to.

17
00:03:33,440 --> 00:04:14,340
Anyway, so to give context, so after the Gears of War stream and I had dinner, I got grabbed some dinner and I was debating should I tank it and stay up to oh yeah I forgot to be like I'm live this is how out of it I am right now my brain is not okay um all right live now okay there you go so uh so I was debating like oh do I just tank it to three in the morning and then I stay up until three.

18
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,780
So I was just like, maybe I can do it.

19
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,220
And at that time, it was like 9 p.m.

20
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,140
And I was like, I feel so alive.

21
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,980
You know, I'm like, I can take, I can take over the world.

22
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,760
I'm so alive.

23
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,520
But then I remember, you know, because I'm like, I can do this.

24
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,580
It's 3 a.m.

25
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,220
That's like child's play.

26
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,920
But I forgot, you know, I'm not at university anymore where, you know, I would fucking tank until 6 a.m.

27
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,100
morning.

28
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,820
Like, as if it's nothing, I'll do that back to back.

29
00:04:43,160 --> 00:06:08,880
you know because i had such youthful energy inside i don't have that anymore i don't have the the naiveness and the the the excitement the what was it the endurance to destroy my health like i did in college so i don't have i don't have the university buff where i was i was so ready to destroy my health and my sleep for one day for maybe several days i feel if I feel wild but uh yeah yeah I couldn't I couldn't do that because at as soon as it as it's like you know it's like Cinderella the moment it hits midnight like it all disappears and that's what happened to me like it hit midnight and then I was like I was dead I was like I I can't I cannot keep going I cannot keep going I was like oh no I'm so so tired so at midnight the magic is all gone and so so i decided okay i'm gonna take a three hour i'll take a three hour nap and it'll be it'll be fine and it was not fine obviously i always tell that i it's a lie i tell myself i'll be like it's okay like you can do it it's just you know

30
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:39,500
the moment you take this nap you'll be fine like you'll be back to normal and that's what i tell myself like i lie to myself so naturally uh it's my little cope that like don't worry it'll be okay it was obviously not okay so i woke up um i woke up at three to get ready for like tech rehearsal because the panel stuff was at 3 30 and um it was fun it was a uh It'll be fine.

31
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,780
I Don't keep her.

32
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,140
Don't gaslight her to even myself.

33
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,820
So it was a great panel.

34
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:59,060
I got to meet a lot of dragoons from EU plus one Canadian dragoon who traveled all the way from Canada to be there because he was actually going to school here in the UK.

35
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,380
So it was meeting everybody at the panel.

36
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,840
And then I get like, supposedly I would get a...

37
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:40,640
a 30 minute break and then it would be the meeting tree um but uh unfortunately um which is understandable if you guys didn't like if you guys never like been into event planning in general like something will always happen because like you know you can't really account for human error or like um things you can't control um so obviously and this is like the second time they've hosted vexpo so it's very understandable that They haven't had everything figured out yet,

38
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,520
like a lot of variables and stuff like that.

39
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:49,900
And a lot of times, if you guys didn't notice, conventions are mostly run by volunteers, especially if it's not for profit.

40
00:07:50,440 --> 00:08:01,440
So a lot of the staff, not just like Vexpo, but like a lot of conventions in general, anime conventions in general are run by volunteers, like people who are passionate about VTubers.

41
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,580
And so they're not paid to be staff.

42
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,380
They volunteered their own time to be the staff.

43
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,320
So obviously a lot of checks and balances.

44
00:08:08,420 --> 00:09:06,860
and a lot of um you know like you know uh uh you know uh communication stuff can can go wrong because like when you know people aren't being paid for this so obviously like uh things can go wrong because there's no like account there's not really like accountability when you're like i'm doing for free bro like if i get yelled at for some as a if i was a volunteer for anything like and i give up my own fucking time like to do something and i get yelled at for it i'll be like bro you're not even paying me like come on which is very understandable like even i would be like what the fuck like i'm i'm here for free like so so it's um it's very understandable Hannibal.

45
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:19,480
So, yeah, so the meet and greet for my meet and greet, it started, I guess, like, I think it started an hour late.

46
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:26,280
So, obviously, like, because, like, there was some delays in the beginning.

47
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,300
There were some delays behind, like, everything was just behind schedule.

48
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:36,240
So, everyone was thinking all the meeting and stuff was incredibly behind schedule because of the delay that was going on.

49
00:09:36,260 --> 00:11:00,320
um and because of that um i was supposed to end at 6 30 a.m like my meet and greet slot was supposed to end at 6 30 a.m and i was like deep time yay but it started at 6 in the morning so it didn't so um it didn't end so obviously um because it started really late um I basically stayed up three hours extra for the meet and greet because obviously it's not just me like dragoons as well had to wait in line for like two hours as well as for the meeting greet because of the delay you know they're like oh yeah be here uh be here for the meet and greet line and no well six in the morning for me like eu for them I don't even know what time it is like not really good time zones but for for eu it's not six in the morning it's thank god for them it's not six in the morning um so everything was like behind schedule i really apologize for for the delay for that um but yeah so i went to bed at around 8 30 a.m because uh because to be fair to be fair it is it is the perfect uk experience if you've

50
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:08,020
never been to the uk before and you're I want to experience the entire, you know, the entire joy of being in the United Kingdom.

51
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:14,620
And queuing is basically one of their favorite pastimes, standing in line.

52
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,720
So congratulations.

53
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,600
Congratulations.

54
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,140
You got to experience the United Kingdom's favorite pastime.

55
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,920
And standing in line for long periods of time.

56
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,180
It truly is a very authentic tradition.

57
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,630
It's a classic, the prime Birmingham experience, if you think about it.

58
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,540
So, you're welcome.

59
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,260
It is a national, yeah, the national sport of the United Kingdom.

60
00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:02,260
But, yeah, so, basically, it was, we started out late.

61
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:13,400
So obviously, I feel really bad too because we started late, and then because of our delay, it caught the delay earlier.

62
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:21,160
And then the delay was building up gradually because of it, I guess because of that, every mean and grie was late then.

63
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,740
Because, if you delay the start, then everything will get pushed back.

64
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,940
So I think everything was behind schedule in general.

65
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:54,640
But I did feel really bad because a lot of dragoons were waiting for so long and um and um he said oh also like i uh the pen we were like oh what's the pen plotter the pen plotter is basically like uh there was an autograph station where um i could give you guys like a live autograph um um from a machine but for some reason mine didn't work

66
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:12,220
So basically we had to stop the meet and greet for a little bit for like five to ten minutes Because we were trying to do like tech support and being like why isn't it working?

67
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:21,580
But then after like um after my meet and greet done the next the next person the slot after me Works it worked again.

68
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,020
It decided to work again.

69
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,620
So I'm like what the fuck?

70
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:30,080
Like fuck me I guess like oh my god.

71
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:49,960
Oh like I guess I need to find a temple and go fucking wash all the, I swear, I think a spirit attached, a bad spirit attached to me, I swear to God, I am like the anti-tech right now, uh, the bad luck strikes again, so I feel really bad, because some people,

72
00:13:50,100 --> 00:14:57,060
obviously, you know, some people after the meet and greet or after today, um, they have to leave or go back home, because not everybody's doing the two days, And it's just like I legitimately Googled I legitimately Googled on the internet temples where I can get spirit cleansing And I legitimately Googled that because I got so paranoid I was legitimately I was like literally thinking like Oh my god like like did a fucking spirit like attached to me or something you know like you know like those folklore where um like the like the the Asian folklore where if you visit somewhere and there's like bad spirits there they'll start like riding your shoulders and stuff and like and like cause like bad like bad luck to you wherever you go like that I was like oh my god you're right maybe I should get an online exorcism maybe I should go like on I should go on Etsy and like buy those like um spirit cleansing dolls or some remember that shit i found on etsy where they make like these voodoo dolls

73
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:06,520
and they start fucking stabbing it and stuff on it like the spirit riding crazy

74
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:15,360
how convenient i'll i'm maybe i can amazon prime my my spirit cleansing uh

75
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:27,220
So I'm just, so I'm just like thinking like, holy shit, like, I'm so, I'm so tired.

76
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:39,840
Like, I literally got, I literally got a fucking, like a CPU from Costa Rica of a, of not even a fucking CPU card.

77
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:48,840
Like I ordered an AMD card and got an Intel processor in my AMD packaging that was made 20 years ago.

78
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,600
Costa Rica.

79
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:54,780
Like how is, how is this real?

80
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:58,600
How is my luck like this?

81
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,140
Costa Rica is normal.

82
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:08,240
Yeah, the and with the motherboard still attached to it.

83
00:16:08,800 --> 00:17:17,460
Like, I can't believe the motherboard was still until scam card like it was crazy um for those who don't know the story of that i talked a bit on twitter and on and on stream but i ordered this on it was the first time i've ever ordered this uh it ordered like a computer pc part online and um because i really wanted the specific um the specific cpu and then i didn't check the packaging because uh i am very naive and gullible so um so it was a harsh lesson in life and by the time i finally checked it it was already one month past the return policy and no i never got never got my money back so yeah i lost like almost nine i lost like 900 like 900 canadian dollars for it um but but i i swear If I ever do another charity auction,

84
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,380
I will sign this card and like auction it off for charity.

85
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:39,240
If anyone else wants a Intel processor that was made 20 years ago, still attached to a piece of its motherboard, signed by me, that's worth technically $20.

86
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,900
By the way, this card, you can buy it off eBay for $20.

87
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:55,880
And the thing about that card is that that card, oh, this is the worst part about this card.

88
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:01,400
But that card, you can only get it on eBay.

89
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,480
Like, you can't, like, because it's never sold to the public, by the way.

90
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,780
It was never sold to the public.

91
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,120
It was only for workstations.

92
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,580
So, like, for offices.

93
00:18:15,160 --> 00:19:28,980
there uh so uh all right what was my but yeah i just couldn't believe that that happened to me but it was a very it was a very it's a very common amazon scam where they basically they basically um um order a computer part and then uh from amazon and then they basically get like those steamers where they can see okay I'm gonna teach you guys how to scam but like don't do this please don't do this or or it could happen to me again please I could be the customer that gets your fucking return package don't do this but anyway to do this you basically get those like steamers and you steam the uh you steam like the packaging stickers and everything so it's not like you rip it and so like they steam the packaging stickers so it'll come off naturally so it doesn't look like it was open and after that they just take out the packaging and get the card out and then like um and then put like whatever you know whatever like hand me down card or processor in the packaging and just like tape it all

94
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:44,780
back up because you steam the tag you steam the stickers and everything so it's not look like a rip and amazon they don't really look at what's If fucking you think the Amazon workers are paid good wages, that's very funny.

95
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:48,600
Jeff Bezos did not become a billionaire by paying good wages.

96
00:19:52,240 --> 00:20:03,400
So the underpaid, the underpaid Amazon workers will just look at the packaging and be like, oh, it's not open.

97
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,580
It's not open.

98
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,400
Clearly nothing was tampered.

99
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:44,780
um because it wasn't open and they'll sell it as new they'll sell it as new to the anyone else that ordered the same thing and just ship it back to whoever and silly me for now obviously it was very fucking stupid of me to like not check the packaging but it was also my very first time ordering a cpu from amazon i never got and i haven't got scammed at that time before so i was just like i was like oh clearly this looks real because i looked up packaging I took a picture of the packaging and showed it to my friend who also had the same CPU and I was like Hey,

100
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:45,460
does this look legit?

101
00:20:45,620 --> 00:21:04,560
And they're like, yeah, and I was like, okay, and I proceed to not open it for the next two months I was like, so I was like, that's good enough for me and I didn't open it for two months because I was like, I'll worry about that later

102
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,320
That's why that's why I didn't know.

103
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,540
I didn't know until I opened it and I was like, why does this say?

104
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:20,280
Why does this say Intel and made from Costa Rica?

105
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,460
I was like, I was so confused.

106
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:26,420
I was like, why does it, I thought this was AMD.

107
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,380
I thought this is AMD.

108
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,180
Like I'm, I'm, I'm so confused.

109
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:39,620
And then I'm like, oh, wait, wait, I think I got scammed.

110
00:21:40,760 --> 00:23:03,850
why is like a piece of like a cut like it was it was like at the bottom it was really like glued to a mother like it was cut from a motherboard so it has like cut lines to it too um no it's actually attached to it it's literally um it's literally like they literally just cut the motherboard they didn't even like detach whatever the processor they cut it out of a they made a square cut from a motherboard so there's like cut scars like um surrounding from the bottom like you'd see okay i'll show you guys the photo again for those who've never seen the photo it's actually fucking crazy like for those who've never saw the photo i'll show it to you guys again um for never watched the stream let's see all right here you go here's the photo so literally that bottom part right here right here at the bottom you see that bottom that's the piece of the motherboard that that's literally a piece of the motherboard at the bottom it was fucking it was still attached to it too uh it's not even it's

111
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:18,390
not you can't even take it off like you can't even do anything with this that's the way i like i can't even do anything it's still attached to get that out of it like

112
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:47,270
so i'm just like that's why i was like bro should i go to a temple or something Because, like, because, like, before this, I literally was on a plane that we're, I swear, this year has had the most, has had the most wildest thing to ever happen to me within this,

113
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:49,130
within 2025.

114
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:52,910
I've had so many crazy shit happen to me.

115
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:57,310
And I'm like, this should not be happening to me within the year.

116
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:06,650
Producer, I haven't heard, like, my travel stories, like, last month.

117
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:25,950
I had, during my plane ride, flying back from China to Canada, the fucking pilot, during my plane ride, was like, we had to re- Good evening, passengers.

118
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:30,830
We're going to have to reroute, we're going to have to reroute the flight because a volcano erupted.

119
00:24:30,970 --> 00:25:02,340
um within our flight path so we're gonna be a we're gonna have a slight delay as we figure out how um the new pathway and during my flight like a fucking volcano erupted like what the fuck were the odds of that like what did i have never had that happen i've been flying for so long And the fact that during that flight,

120
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:14,180
while I'm still in the plane, the volcano, a volcano that was in my pathway, where my path home had a volcanic eruption.

121
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,640
And like, I legitimately thought I was going to die.

122
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,380
Because I was like, holy fuck.

123
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:28,920
And then, and then before that, flying to China.

124
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:37,880
I flew in the worst rainstorm ever recorded in Hong Kong history.

125
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:41,720
And it was called the Black Rain.

126
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:46,660
That does not sound like a thing you survive in.

127
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:51,880
Like, I flew during, in the Black Rain.

128
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,300
That's what they called it.

129
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:58,760
The worst rainstorm in Hong Kong since the 1800s.

130
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,640
Like, and they called it the black rain.

131
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,020
And I'm like, and I flew through that.

132
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:09,480
Like,

133
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:21,680
and that was like within the week of the fucking volcanic eruption.

134
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:42,760
I took four flights in between that, like, you know, flying to Hong Kong to, and then to, guanjo and then guanjo to japan japan to canada like that was like the fact that those two the black rain and the volcanic eruption happened within a week of each other

135
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:55,800
so so i'm just thinking i'm like like and then three weeks later the fucking intel kosa rica

136
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,520
Sorry, the Intel processor...

137
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,440
Three weeks later, I had to deal with this shit!

138
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,900
After I survived, this shit happened to me.

139
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,420
This shit happened to me.

140
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,220
So, yeah, no.

141
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:24,900
Things have been pretty weird so far.

142
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:28,880
And 20... I survived 20-25.

143
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,760

149
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:29,060
I don't think it's silly anymore I How many times does this have to happen to me before it gets less silly Little does she know I swear to God it's guys it's getting less and less silly now And then Bro didn't return the slab.

150
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,040
Patria has said, thank you for the super chat.

Thank you, thank you.

152
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,080
Because it's still a silly trend, right guys?

153
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:44,080
Is this how people start believing in horoscopes?

154
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:49,520
How many times does it have to happen to me before it gets too real?

Thank you.

169

Maybe God just decided let there be a volcanic eruption and black storm on those days.

170
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,680
Thank you for the super chat.

171
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,220
Thank you.

172
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:19,920
Thank you.

173
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:25,460
Guys, guys, I'm one bad day away from becoming an astrology girl.

174
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:55,320
you don't want that for your worst enemies guys you don't want that i'm one bad day away from fucking being an astrology girl guys i'm this close i'm literally like the line is in front of me i'm getting there anything no don't join the dark side god spoken like a true leo

175
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:21,330
Anyway, anyway, there is a, um, there's a little dad update today, um, so if you guys didn't know, dad has been very, very bratty lately, um, and, uh, for those who are like, oh my gosh, what's going on, we know dogs are just like that, like, I, they just suddenly decide that,

176
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:31,010
you know, this week, I want to make your life fucking hell, like, they don't care, like, And they're just, they're just, they're literally just born this way.

177
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:36,050
Every weeder dog I've ever owned has always been incredibly bratty.

178
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,690
It's just their nature.

179
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:51,650
And so today, so for those who don't know, he is technically banished from using my bed.

180
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:55,790
Because obviously it's so comfy for him to sleep in my bed.

181
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:55,610
um so um but i've only i gave him one exception which is when i sleep so whenever i sleep he's allowed to sleep in my bed because then he stays in my bed but when i don't when i don't let him um while i'm sleeping my bed when i'm working it's more risky because i can't like keep an eye on him like when he wants to like because i do upstairs because i'm like i'm really worried he decided to be like he he i'm just gonna jump to the side instead of using the stairs because i'm fucking stupid um and and i love the thrill of breaking my back again he um so so like i can't monitor that when i'm working so i i just kick the stairs away and push it against the wall um and he doesn't like that uh he gets really mad whenever i do that so especially when i'm not heading to bed And I'm just,

182
00:32:56,070 --> 00:33:03,490
you know, I decide to, like, just, I wanted to stay in bed and just, like, relax in bed and not sleep, like, during the middle of the day or in the morning, where I don't get up.

183
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:10,470
And, like, after I walk, dad, in the morning, and then I went, go back to bed and just lie down there for a bit, because I'm just like, it's so early.

184
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:14,530
I just want to fucking relax a little bit before I get to work.

185
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:24,490
Dad really hates that, because he's like, why do you get to sleep on the bed, and I don't?

186
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:26,530
I live here, too.

187
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:28,870
Where are my rights?

188
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:34,810
So he's like, excuse me.

189
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:39,250
I deserve to be on that bed as well.

190
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:42,290
I have the right to be here.

191
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:48,790
So does he pay rent or something?

192
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:52,030
I wish he paid rent with the way he's treating me.

193
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,370
It's my bed, too.

194
00:33:54,790 --> 00:34:00,550
Like, he gets, he gets very demanding if I'm just lying in bed and I, and he, the stairs aren't there.

195
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:09,370
So he would like bark at me and, um, be like, uh, uh, and like, um, be like, come on, pick me up.

196
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:10,890
Put the stairs back on.

197
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:20,210
So, and or like, just like sat, like, push himself out of the top of the, like, with his front legs on the edge of the bed and like be like, come on, let me up.

198
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:20,990
Come on.

199
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:24,770
And so, like, give me my upies.

200
00:34:24,790 --> 00:35:19,490
and so so recently including today because he did this a week ago but I didn't talk about it um because I forgot um but like today what he what he did was that he tried to move the stairs himself closer to the bed and like what do you mean by move the stairs he would he'd try he would all the stairs and like push it closer to the bed but he's so but he okay the best I was like I was like what is that sound honestly so confused I was like why what is he scratching because the the staircase is like up against the on the opposite side of the wall so like you know I have to like get up to after like sit up to like see the stairs so I sat up and I literally saw him Like,

201
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:26,070
just fucking up, pawing, clawing the stairs closer and closer to attach to my bed.

202
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:30,790
But, thank God, he hasn't learned how to rotate it.

203
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:36,510
And, like, what the fuck do you mean?

204
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:39,330
He hasn't learned how to rotate it.

205
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:44,950
All right, don't worry, I took a picture because I was like, what the fuck are you doing?

206
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:49,210
So, so, so, he...

207
00:35:49,230 --> 00:36:55,550
he he almost got it he almost so the stair was is originally because i got him it instantly took a boy it's like what the fuck and so the stair was originally pushed up against the back of that wall guys it was and he had he pushed it all the way against my bed like that's how far he pushed it this is not what it looks like I swear to God he who did that oh how did the stairs get here oh my yeah it's so weird right that's so weird so thank God he has not yet learned how to rotate this so I about him like you know while i'm working he fucking moves the staircase himself

208
00:37:01,570 --> 00:38:11,910
for being in the super chat thank you thank you old dogs can learn new tricks it's like it's like you know how okay this is why i also don't really want to get cats um because they're like oh man like oh you should get a cat because they're more low maintenance also like i don't want them to sit in my face on my face i've i've heard like stories where like it depends on a cat right but like some cats would if you don't feed them in time they try to suffocate you by like sitting on your face until you until you stop breathing and wake up and like i i don't i don't know i i just don't trust myself to like wake up so so um it really depends on your face on a cat I'm like thinking I'm thinking oh man knowing my luck I might get that type I might get that cat anyway um also that I'm worried that like I'm worried that the cat's gonna learn how to open doors because apparently I heard that it depends on the cat obviously so that I'm worried that I'm gonna get a cat that can open doors I'm

209
00:38:11,910 --> 00:39:04,590
like what if I'm in the bathroom like I don't want like I don't know what if I'm in the bathroom I'm just doing my business in the bathroom and then the cat fucking opens my door like I don't want to that's weird that's just I don't want to look at my cat well I'm like why don't I look at my cat while I'm pooping like that's so weird and he just opens my door like yo so like that's just I'm worried about that open doors yet so far so the best he's just he's trying to learn how to rotate stairs that's like the lead that's the thing i have to worry about right now um i can't my bathroom door doesn't lock it that's the worst part like my bathroom door doesn't lock so i can't even do that

210
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:18,890
So, like, right now, the worst thing I have to, like, worry about from dad at the moment is him learning how to rotate the stairs.

211
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:22,350
So, like, right now, that's the worst thing I have to worry about.

212
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:25,190
And at least he's not trying to suffocate me.

213
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:27,630
So, like, at least that's, like, a plus.

214
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:34,570
Once he learns to rotate that chair, he'll rotate door handles.

215
00:39:40,200 --> 00:40:50,980
so so yeah so that's the dad update for today sounds like shit design like a thank you thank you thank you um patria said thank you super chat thank you thank you thank you is that fluff from a plushie he hunted yeah he um he has so many toys and also a lot of destroyed he can't like um there's no toy he can't destroy because like i said winter dogs were meant to be hunting dogs so um so they're surprisingly very very very strong so they destroy every fucking toy you buy them even when you give them those like industrial toys that advertise are like they're basically indestructible they cannot are they very tough to chew you can fucking rip that shit apart because they're meant they're bred to be hunting they were bred to hunt badgers and badgers are like times to their size um fudge shop thank you for the super chat thank you thank you speaking of dogs have you seen the movie fix it's by the guy who made samurai jack and has it just a little but in it and it's about neutering a dog

216
00:40:50,980 --> 00:41:17,340
yes it's all about extremely crude humor thank you for super chat fledged up thinking that yes i have heard about it i it was all over twitter when um it first came out and when the movie actually when the trailer first came out and i loved okay not gonna lie it's so it was so funny when i saw um when i saw like tweets being like um Oh,

217
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,860
what was the, what, what was the animator's name?

218
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:31,360
Um, no, I, I, I like saw the trailers and I like, I didn't watch the movie, but like, I saw the trailers and the Twitter was tweeting at the the strip club scene.

219
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:35,760
The strip club dog scene.

220
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,100
Um, so don't worry.

221
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:42,760
I, I know exactly what type of humor that, that movie is, but it's by Gendi.

222
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:43,480
What's isn't it?

223
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:44,000
Gendi, right?

224
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,400
I don't know how to pronounce his name.

225
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,080
Gendi.

226
00:41:46,980 --> 00:43:13,340
um for those who don't know this animator is that how you pronounce his name gendi jen gendi turtakovsky turtakovsky so he has made dexter's laboratory hotel transylvania um samurai jack prima star wars clone wars he's done all that like the russian animator he also did the um the pilot the pilot pitch for Popeyes and then he released the trailer for fixed which is basically extremely crude humor about sex violence uh more sex gross humor and gore and it's all dogs and so they're like for those who are like oh it can't be that bad i think like it opens up with the dog humping the grandma's leg the main character dog humping the grandma's leg and like talking dirty to the leg so it was like extremely crude humor and then twitter exploded and was like,

227
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,960
how could Tartowski do that?

228
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:18,480
How could he do that?

229
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:20,320
What happened to him?

230
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:23,240
Oh my God, what a fall from grace.

231
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:28,500
And then I was like, bro, did you not?

232
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:42,380
I know, like, you can tell that they did not watch the last season of Samurai Jack or Primal because Tartowski, yeah, he's done.

233
00:43:42,400 --> 00:44:36,540
like all these children animated shit but he is he had like the most repressed you can tell he was repressing a lot of the sexual jokes and the horniness he was fuck okay primal was fucking wild you can tell they never even watched primal he was holding back so much and like in the last scene of samurai he's a freak you can tell he's a freak inside he was suppressing some freakiness inside because like if you look at like all the like especially the female designs in samurai jack like that guy was you know he had like he he was suppressing a lot

234
00:44:42,540 --> 00:46:06,110
opportunities like I'm gonna let it all out I mean bro okay I'll give a spoiler alert it's a really fucked up scene and also look at Dexter's mom's design also okay so um I will say that if you ever watched Prima okay I'm also I'm so sorry about the dokey jam like I'm on a really long time it right now but there's so many things i want to talk about um but if you've ever watched primal which is um his last work and i believe it's on adult swim i think at the end of primal the main okay spoiler if you guys don't want to be spoiled by primal at all i'm gonna spoil it guys um i'm gonna spoil this is a oh hbo it's on hbo so he had like a fucking he went wild with that show because he was like not restrained by corporate i guess like by corporate cartoon network or like you know by by companies at that time because hbo was like go fucking wild at that point here's like here's like five hundred thousand dollars you just do whatever you want um so he wasn't restrained at that time and even i

235
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:19,250
i think that's why like um he was so suppressed I'm pretty sure, like, the things he wanted to put on was definitely heavily censored by, like, the producers and the investors.

236
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:22,990
Because they're like, okay, okay, Tertowski, we gotta get Tertowski.

237
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:24,150
You gotta calm down.

238
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:34,640
That's what I think it was, okay, not gonna lie, I think it was good that he had less creative freedom.

239
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:41,020
Because Fix was wild.

240
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:54,200
He got a little too creative because Netflix, I would say Netflix does not care as much as other companies.

241
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:58,620
They just throw a butt because it's just, it's a streamy stream world.

242
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,020
Netflix does not care that much.

243
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,880
So like he had so much freedom to do whatever the fuck he wants.

244
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:13,000
So but basically in primal, at the end of primal, the main case.

245
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:36,380
character gets heavily burnt up where like he was just all bandages and like obviously he was gonna fucking die so and then out of nowhere his love interest was like I want a baby

246
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:53,860
in packages And then she was like and then like and then it cuts the black Child

247
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:03,520
Well, it's like what happened?

248
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:23,900
He just continued the bloodline and then obviously he's dead like he's he's not alive anymore but i was just like oh my god what the what the fuck what what if what i

249
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:44,560
have one more in me the bloodline does not end here so i was like jesus christ you're wild genedy oh my god

250
00:48:50,560 --> 00:49:38,160
so so I was like Jesus Christ so for those who were like I can't believe he would make such a movie like a flop I'm like no that guy was suppressing so much he he's been waiting I would believe he's been waiting like what 30 years 30 years to do what he wanted to do yeah he he went out and a bang that's for sure um um but yeah that's basically that that i know that movie the the the clips i saw it's it's really oh my gosh i don't even know how i don't even know like how to explain it you gotta watch the clip i mean i don't even know if i should link the clips honestly

251
00:49:42,410 --> 00:49:48,990
oh it was apparently in development hell for years yeah no this man was and make his dreams come true.

252
00:49:56,890 --> 00:49:59,910
Um, Fletch stop.

253
00:50:00,110 --> 00:50:00,830
Thank you, Super Chat.

254
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:01,150

Thank you.

256
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:01,950
Okay.

257
00:50:02,110 --> 00:50:05,390
To be fair with Fix, there are some deep moments at the middle.

258
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:09,270
The opening filters some people and the whole movie.

259
00:50:09,530 --> 00:50:10,650
So member stream.

260
00:50:10,830 --> 00:50:11,650
Thank you, the Super Chat.

261
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:12,010
Thank you.

262
00:50:12,110 --> 00:50:12,610
Thank you.

263
00:50:13,070 --> 00:50:13,310
Okay.

264
00:50:14,270 --> 00:51:30,130
Even during, all right oh my gosh i don't want to spoil you guys i i like saw like one moment of the d moment because i was just like what the fuck is going on so um i'll spoil a scene for you guys i like describe it but not in too detailed so the main dog has a crush on this other dog who is like a prize winning beauty contest dog and like a purebred he's a mutt you know like the typical lady in the trap stuff but like um so and the thing about for those who don't know about like dog contest usually like you know they the dog dog contest owners will do like arrange arrange sessions with their dogs if they're also award-winning dogs so they're like we're gonna create the the most beautiful um we're gonna create the most beautiful award-winning puppies with our dogs together and like it's like the horse thing you know like um you know how gold ship gets paid like a hundred grand or i don't fucking know like eight grand per session to create the best horse racers it's basically the same

265
00:51:30,130 --> 00:52:21,650
with dogs for a dog contest so they do that too to get like the full purebred shit yeah so so like she was supposed to dog contest winner and he's like this egotistical dog and um and the mutt the main character mutt was like no i've always loved her since since the day she moved next door to me and that's like the entire plot of her like and also him not wanting to get neutered so it's like basically like him not wanting to get neutered and also wanting to get with the other the purebred dog and and so the emotional part is that um he went to a trip club

266
00:52:25,690 --> 00:53:47,530
also is my mic okay i realized i've been oh my god i've been peaking this entire time i hope i haven't um because every time i laugh i see it hit red so i'm sorry if i'm peaking right now okay so they went to it okay not really thank god okay they went to a dog strip club and it's basically like like other female dogs it's it's wild it's just it's just a giant dog's fight it's just a dog strip club and it's like wow and then he bumps into a dog that looks like her his crush um he pumps a new dog that looks like his crush and she's like you want to have a good time and then so you know they do it and then in the middle of doing it the crush shows up it was like how could you i you cheated on me i can't believe that she catches him in the act it's like how could you do this to me oh my god and then the mud was like i thought you were at that session with the other dogs like I love that session so I could see you and then and then obviously like um he couldn't get out of his thing because

267
00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:59,250
if you know Tom if you've ever read um Omega Alpha Beta uh fanfix you know why he couldn't do anything

268
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:33,920
so so he's like i think her name was so he's like honey no this is what it looks like while he's like still stuck and so so the emotional part was that he ran um he ran back to where honey was with the other male dog and like he was like honey i'm so sorry but like to avoid her getting,

269
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:36,480
you know, getting on with the other dog.

270
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:40,300
Because the other dog didn't open his eyes because he's like, he loves himself.

271
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:42,160
So he's just looking at like himself and everything.

272
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:44,200
And he's just like in the moment.

273
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:47,800
So he didn't open his eyes throughout the whole session.

274
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:59,380
So what the main dog did was that he was, because he's a tiny dog compared to the purebred woman dog.

275
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,900
So he was like one third her size.

276
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:11,860
So the main dog basically got on top of her and just shimmy down.

277
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:21,780
So then the purebred male dog didn't bang her, but banged him.

278
00:55:24,380 --> 00:57:26,470
well they were well well the mutt and the purebred female dog had an emotional talk about how much they love each other well he was getting banged by the other male dog so i don't fucking know what you mean when you said it gets really emotional in the middle because because but i watched that scene i am not feeling emotional watching that scene like please stop toky we love bisexual representation they have they have an emotional that sounds so oh yeah yeah it sounds so graphic right imagine watching that because I am trying to spare as many details as possible because it's so much more worse than whatever i'm saying and that's why i i was like no i was like it's so like he's a fucking hidden i knew he was a freak i fucking knew it i was like i'm so disappointed in uh ternikowski i was like no he has suppressed this freak for 20 years like this is what happens never suppress your inner freak guys this is or he or another fix will come never suppress it let it out before it builds up

279
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:47,670
and it's too late like he let that shit build up for so long and this is what happens he had to let that freak out somehow and that was the build up of all the freak he had inside him for 30 plus years and we let that happen we

280
00:57:51,170 --> 00:57:53,530
We fucking let that happen.

281
00:57:53,830 --> 00:57:55,370
We suppressed him.

282
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,500
They listened to us all.

283
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:04,640
Never again.

284
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:06,140
We.

285
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:08,040
It's like, okay.

286
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:12,780
Doki is like Dracula full flow right now.

287
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:14,360
Okay, so thank you for the super chat.

Thank you.

290
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:21,340
Okay, so this reminded me of, oh my God, what's his name?

291
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:23,480
What's the artist's name?

292
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:50,980
the the guy that did kimba when like his daughter found out he was like a freak too it just it just reminded me of the the kimba artist um the the famous japanese artist that her his daughter found out was also like really freaky because he had like a hidden stash of

293
00:58:54,060 --> 00:59:24,120
like his desk yeah but those who don't know he drew yeah the guy who did astro boy and kimba and that's the yeah and so yeah his daughter after he passed away his daughter was cleaning his desk and everything and they found like they like she found like she was like so surprised she's like oh my gosh what the oh Wait,

294
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,940
I didn't know my dad drew this.

295
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:32,700
So, yeah, so it was just like drawers and drawers of like unfinished sketches or like practice sketches.

296
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:42,820
And I think it was like one third of them were like I mean, some of them were naked rats and then snake girls.

297
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:47,280
Yeah, she washing them up.

298
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:52,480
And so I'm like never suppress your freak guys or you'll build up.

00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:59,200
Never suppress That's the, yeah, if you look, okay, I won't put, I'll post a link to it, but I'm not going to show it.

myself um man they actually played every single one of your games and uh it's crazy so many talented dragons and uh like a lot you guys are so talented and in my community and It's really crazy to just see you guys make all these cool-ass games for me and all the other dragoons to try.

01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:26,800
Okay, by the way, after this week, I'm going to rest like one to...

330

I'm going to...

331
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:30,160
I have a stream on Monday for a sponsor.

332
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:32,880
I can say it right now.

333
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:33,600
say I announce it.

334
01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:34,980
It's an Overwatch sponsor on Monday.

335
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:38,940
So I have an Overwatch sponsor on Monday.

336
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:48,460
So I'm going to take Sunday off and then do my Overwatch sponsor and then Tuesday off.

337
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:52,140
And then if my voice is messed up a little, I'm going to take Wednesday off.

338
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:52,960
So it really depends.

339
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:54,160
Because like I need to heal.

340
01:07:54,260 --> 01:07:56,240
Like I've been talking too much.

341
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:00,540
I've been talking a lot this week.

342
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:06,620
So I'm Because, like, I can't, obviously, like, Monday is a sponsor, so I kind of take that day off.

343
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:10,580
But, yeah, Monday and Tuesday will definitely be my off days, by the way.

344
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:13,260
Hmm.

from my camera last day.

353
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:40,900
You saw it up to the head staff, to the staff that was delegated this project.

354
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:42,900
They worked really hard on everything.

355
01:08:43,660 --> 01:08:46,960
And organizing all this, especially the participation reward.

356
01:08:48,140 --> 01:08:50,260
And handling all the logistics in Discord.

357
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:57,060
And also Kino too, for organizing all of this as well and gathering the artists and stuff to do the trailer and the postcard.

358
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:58,100
You'd show it to them.

359
01:08:58,460 --> 01:09:02,880
Anyway, let's finally check out Doki Jam.

360
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:04,400
I was giving a list of games.

361
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:06,340
I don't know how long I'll be checking.

362
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:09,740
I'll be looking through all these games for.

363
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:12,880
But I'm doing them randomly.

364
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:15,720
I was giving the public vote of top 10.

365
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:21,040
And then a staff list of other games as well to check out.

366
01:09:21,340 --> 01:09:23,980
So I won't be going through like top 10 and then staff list.

367
01:09:24,180 --> 01:10:04,680
I'll be clicking randomly because I want to give everyone like an equal opportunity, their games and stuff so um and i might do future streams of it too you know like maybe like after the jams over i'll do a future stream to check out more games that you guys made for me um if especially guys i heard like a lot of people who couldn't finish your game in time but still really wanted to um update their game in the future so like you know if you guys want to update your game in the future and i haven't checked it out yet like feel free to and then in the future I might do another I will do another stream looking through all the games in the donkey jam So yeah,

368
01:10:04,780 --> 01:10:15,040
because you know, there's so much there's so much content to go through and you guys worked so hard Like you guys had two weeks to create the game Anyway It's time for to actually check it out.

369
01:10:15,180 --> 01:11:00,760
I'm sorry Vaughan watcher skip one hour So it's like it's like a stream starts here like one hour and ten minutes later And if you're like what the fuck happens for one hour and like 40 50 percent of that was me talking about like uh the dog movie like i was so infested in and then and talking about freaky animators all right let's see i remember which tab okay so this is the first random random jokey jam game we're gonna try out it's called It is this one.

370
01:11:02,020 --> 01:11:02,600
Oh, come on.

371
01:11:02,740 --> 01:11:03,420
Show yourself.

372
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:04,480
Don't be shy.

373
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:09,160
Come on.

374
01:11:10,580 --> 01:11:11,200
Oh, wait.

375
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:12,160
Okay, here you go.

376
01:11:13,820 --> 01:11:15,000
I want to make sure I got it correct.

377
01:11:15,140 --> 01:11:15,860
Okay, it's this one.

378
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:17,420
All right.

379
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:20,700
So, this is the first game I'm going to try out.

380
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:23,460
It's called Doki's Most Wanted.

381
01:11:23,620 --> 01:11:25,660
So, it is a self-puzzle game.

382
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:26,980
I chose this randomly.

383
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:28,640
I have, like, a bunch of tabs open.

384
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:30,860
I chose, I just, like, Bam.

385
01:11:31,900 --> 01:11:39,460
Doki's most wanted is a stealth puzzle game where you navigate through a mirrored floors from Mint's Grand Castle.

386
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:43,580
Avoid the eyes of the wisp as you perform the ultimate heist.

387
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:48,780
Many obstacles stand in your way, but you got a few tricks up your own sleeves as well.

388
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:53,680
By the way, I've never touched any of these games before, so it's like first-hand experience.

389
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:57,460
So, like I said, I don't know what's going to happen.

390
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:58,140
So, alright.

391
01:11:58,300 --> 01:11:59,840

393
01:12:58,860 --> 01:13:03,460
it may or may not have been a very bad idea to use up most of my voice to talk about fix the movie.

394
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:07,840
But, you know, in hindsight.

395
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:14,280
I could have, I could have chose my time more wisely.

Okay, we got it.

The first hurdle.

We did it.

416
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:18,180

Okay, sound guy, we need you here.

This is your time to shine sound.

419
01:14:24,980 --> 01:14:27,500
There's a lot of games with very different volumes.

420
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:29,740
So good luck.

421
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:32,580
All right.

422
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:36,260
Out of play.

423
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:42,080
Sabotage panels and smoking objects by adding them to your Q with E.

424
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:46,000
Start training reaction with R to distract mince goons.

425
01:14:46,540 --> 01:14:47,600
Order is important.

426
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:50,260
Sneak your way to get to the exit.

427
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,920
Press space to get a better view of the low.

428
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:56,940
Okay, I like the little neck stretch.

429
01:14:57,820 --> 01:14:58,140
All right.

430
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:09,320
My boss lives in a castle, has a fat ass, and heavily guarded by ghosts.

431
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:09,920
Where are the other?

432
01:15:10,260 --> 01:15:11,900

It's a Baku.

436
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:18,580
She keeps feeding on my dreams.

437
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:19,920
All right, except a bounty.

438
01:15:20,540 --> 01:15:20,940
Here we go.

439

440
01:15:26,210 --> 01:15:26,570
All right.

01:15:28,150 --> 01:15:29,550
Oh, wait, did I misread that?

Okay, okay, I figured it out, I figured, guys, guys, I figured it out.

529
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:03,240
Through the chain reactions, I have my new hypothesis.

530
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:07,540
Okay, what I do?

531
01:22:07,660 --> 01:22:09,220
do this.

532
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:13,200
I do this.

533
01:22:13,660 --> 01:22:15,160
He fixes that.

534
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:17,720
And then I do this.

535
01:22:19,540 --> 01:22:20,980
And then I do that.

536
01:22:21,660 --> 01:22:21,660
Boom.

537
01:22:22,540 --> 01:22:23,540
And then Boom.

538
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:25,340
And then he fixes that.

539
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:26,640
And then I do this.

540
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:29,640
And I lock him in.

541
01:22:30,340 --> 01:22:32,240
And he goes to baby jail.

542
01:22:32,780 --> 01:22:35,120
And then he fixes this.

543
01:22:35,700 --> 01:22:38,060
And then he's still locked in baby jail.

544
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:40,640
And then I did it.

545
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:47,620
Hey guys, thank you for the five gift of ships.

546
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:48,440
Thank you, thank you.

547
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:49,200
Look at that.

548
01:22:49,260 --> 01:22:50,380
Stupid wisp.

549
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:54,000
That's why you help nobody.

550
01:22:56,180 --> 01:22:56,880
That's right.

551
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:00,840
That's right.

552
01:23:02,460 --> 01:23:31,760

Wait, what does that do?

554
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:36,760
I don't know what I blew up.

555
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:39,840
Like, what did I blow up?

556
01:23:40,340 --> 01:23:40,840
That?

557
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:41,940
The door?

558
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:44,720
What does this do?

559
01:23:45,220 --> 01:23:46,300
Oh, it's that door!

560
01:23:46,780 --> 01:23:48,020
Oh my god, get out of here.

561
01:23:49,140 --> 01:23:50,260
I'm confused.

562
01:23:50,460 --> 01:23:52,420
My brain not computing right now.

563
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:57,180
Is it that door?

564
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:03,580
Okay, we'll do this first.

565
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:06,240
Maybe this.

566
01:24:06,260 --> 01:24:06,760
this.

567
01:24:09,860 --> 01:24:10,620
Boom.

568
01:24:11,940 --> 01:24:12,880
Oh, there they are.

569
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:16,800
Oh, I did it.

570
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:17,600
Yeah.

571
01:24:22,050 --> 01:24:23,730
I'm making it.

572
01:24:24,270 --> 01:24:24,770
That's, whoa.

573
01:24:26,650 --> 01:24:27,930
That's stupid.

574
01:24:28,230 --> 01:24:29,550
I'm right in front of you.

575
01:24:30,030 --> 01:24:31,710
It's because he's so big that.

576
01:24:32,050 --> 01:24:32,050
Oh.

577
01:24:34,510 --> 01:24:40,490
I didn't say the chonkun is so big that Wait, wait a minute.

578
01:24:40,730 --> 01:24:41,630
What are you doing?

579
01:24:41,850 --> 01:24:43,370
Oh my god, he is so big.

580
01:24:43,470 --> 01:24:44,310
What are you doing?

581
01:24:44,430 --> 01:24:45,570
Oh wait, I could use him as cover.

582
01:24:45,970 --> 01:24:54,270
He's so big that like he can't look down, you know, like like he can't look down because his entire belly is blocking the view.

583
01:24:56,870 --> 01:24:59,310
I was gonna say, traitor?

584
01:25:00,270 --> 01:25:02,010
What are you a fucking mercenary?

585
01:25:02,910 --> 01:25:05,710
You're gonna ditch me for the highest paycheck?

586
01:25:08,990 --> 01:25:10,470
Okay, he's right covered.

587
01:25:10,870 --> 01:25:11,230
Thank God.

588
01:25:14,230 --> 01:25:15,430
He's hired up.

589
01:25:15,950 --> 01:25:17,390
Large, giant man.

590
01:25:17,810 --> 01:25:20,590
Can't see in front of him because his stomach blocks me.

591
01:25:23,770 --> 01:25:25,210
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

592
01:25:26,070 --> 01:25:26,430
All right.

593
01:25:27,550 --> 01:25:28,870
He's a double agent.

594
01:25:29,890 --> 01:25:31,170
He's a whiff's goon.

595
01:25:32,930 --> 01:25:35,850
Whatever Mint pays you, I'll pay $1 more.

596
01:25:35,850 --> 01:25:54,190

598
01:26:02,790 --> 01:26:05,610

599
01:26:10,150 --> 01:26:12,810
Alright, yeah, Western Minto.

600
01:26:17,150 --> 01:26:18,090
Whoa, what happened?

601
01:26:18,690 --> 01:26:19,570
What's over here?

602
01:26:19,750 --> 01:26:21,830
If that's where Mint is, what's over here?

603
01:26:21,990 --> 01:26:23,010
Is this, like, the exit?

604
01:26:23,450 --> 01:26:24,210
Oh, it's a gun.

605
01:26:25,370 --> 01:26:26,650
It's a gun.

606
01:26:28,250 --> 01:26:30,070
Oh, that traps her.

607
01:26:31,870 --> 01:26:33,150
And then...

608
01:26:33,150 --> 01:26:33,790
Alright.

609
01:26:34,850 --> 01:26:38,070
Doki finally playing Metal Gear.

610
01:26:39,570 --> 01:26:42,470
Doki, when are you playing the new Metal Gear Solid?

611
01:26:42,850 --> 01:26:43,710
Don't worry, guys.

612
01:26:43,830 --> 01:26:45,370
I have Metal Gear at home.

613
01:26:46,030 --> 01:26:47,310
Metal Gear at home.

614
01:26:48,750 --> 01:26:49,030
Alright.

615
01:26:49,750 --> 01:26:50,490
Oh, oh shit.

616
01:26:50,870 --> 01:26:52,210
Ha ha, she can't see me.

617
01:26:52,510 --> 01:26:53,030
Stupid.

618
01:26:54,250 --> 01:26:54,930
What does this do?

619
01:26:55,710 --> 01:26:56,530
Oh, shit.

620
01:26:56,650 --> 01:26:57,590
I think she saw me.

621
01:26:57,910 --> 01:27:00,070
I don't know what that does.

622
01:27:00,150 --> 01:27:01,330
What did I blow up?

623
01:27:03,850 --> 01:27:04,610
I don't care.

624
01:27:06,530 --> 01:27:07,530
There you go.

625
01:27:09,770 --> 01:27:10,690
Don't worry.

626
01:27:11,370 --> 01:27:12,610
Oh my god, he's like Totoro.

627
01:27:13,870 --> 01:27:14,250
Look at that.

628
01:27:14,310 --> 01:27:15,510
Me and Totoro.

629
01:27:16,430 --> 01:27:16,990
What?

630
01:27:17,110 --> 01:27:18,450
How did he see me?

631
01:27:21,330 --> 01:27:21,890
Okay.

632
01:27:22,710 --> 01:27:24,230
I can't believe it.

633
01:27:24,690 --> 01:27:29,170
I'll pay you one dollar and one cent more if you cover for me.

634
01:27:30,230 --> 01:27:31,370
Oh yeah, I can extend it.

635
01:27:31,410 --> 01:27:31,970
Oh yeah, I forgot.

636
01:27:32,470 --> 01:27:33,490
Don't worry, I got this.

637
01:27:33,790 --> 01:27:35,210
Now I can see...

638
01:27:35,210 --> 01:27:36,310
God damn it.

639
01:27:39,330 --> 01:27:42,470
Now I can see perfectly...

640
01:27:42,470 --> 01:27:46,690
Bum, Bum, Bum, Bum, Bum, Bum, Bum, Bum, Bum, Bum, Bum, Bum.

641
01:27:48,150 --> 01:27:50,090
Make it two cent more.

642
01:27:50,590 --> 01:27:51,750
The art of the idea.

643
01:27:52,790 --> 01:27:53,630
Jesus Christ.

644
01:27:54,410 --> 01:27:55,230
Alright, there you go.

645
01:27:55,350 --> 01:27:56,510
Chomgoon number two.

646
01:27:58,530 --> 01:28:00,690
Yeah, the cents start adding up, okay, guys?

647
01:28:01,050 --> 01:28:01,610
What the fuck?

648
01:28:01,690 --> 01:28:01,890
Okay.

649
01:28:02,250 --> 01:28:02,690
There you go.

650
01:28:03,830 --> 01:28:04,490
All right.

651
01:28:06,810 --> 01:28:07,670
We gotta go here.

652
01:28:07,950 --> 01:28:08,150
Whoa.

653
01:28:09,270 --> 01:28:09,550
All right.

654
01:28:09,690 --> 01:28:10,930
So that's where she is.

655
01:28:11,030 --> 01:28:11,550
I still don't know.

656
01:28:11,810 --> 01:28:12,010
Oh.

657
01:28:12,730 --> 01:28:14,690
Oh, I have to do this later.

658
01:28:15,290 --> 01:28:15,530
Okay.

659
01:28:15,850 --> 01:28:17,870
Actually, I'm gonna try it now and see what it does.

660
01:28:19,550 --> 01:28:20,770
What does it do?

661
01:28:22,770 --> 01:28:24,010
It's just burning.

662
01:28:28,050 --> 01:28:29,730
Why am I burning chains?

663
01:28:31,390 --> 01:28:33,770
Like, I don't know if that is the...

664
01:28:33,790 --> 01:28:43,710
Right temperature for melting point of of chains All right, don't worry Observe makes you warm

665
01:28:47,550 --> 01:28:53,050
Yeah, but I don't think that fire is a melting point.

666
01:28:53,590 --> 01:28:59,990
I feel like I feel like it's gotta be a lot warmer than that What's this?

667
01:29:01,190 --> 01:29:06,830
Well, I'll never know I guess I guess I'll know it's a cigarette.

01:32:13,130 --> 01:32:14,870
I want to know what this does, though.

708
01:32:16,850 --> 01:32:18,230
Does she look that way?

709
01:32:18,410 --> 01:32:19,670
Does she even put it out?

710
01:32:22,650 --> 01:32:24,010
She doesn't care.

711
01:32:24,830 --> 01:32:25,250
She...

712
01:32:25,250 --> 01:32:27,090
What does that do?

713
01:32:27,410 --> 01:32:29,490
She didn't even care.

714
01:32:29,810 --> 01:32:31,410
She's like, oh, it'll fix itself.

715
01:32:31,910 --> 01:32:33,770
It'll fix itself eventually.

716
01:32:33,790 --> 01:32:34,230
right?

717
01:32:36,730 --> 01:32:38,270
I don't even know what it did.

718
01:32:40,270 --> 01:32:42,390
It looked really cool though.

719
01:32:43,990 --> 01:32:47,790
I don't know, I'll just do that just for the fun of it.

720
01:32:52,590 --> 01:32:56,570
Okay, I don't know what this does, but I'm gonna do it.

721
01:33:05,050 --> 01:33:27,420
yeah oh oh oh shit oh shit oh hey guys wait where did she go wait where did she go hello hey

722
01:33:30,810 --> 01:33:38,510
guys am I just chilling here oh wait wait what

723
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:44,380
I should don't know.

724
01:33:45,080 --> 01:33:46,740
Oh, she's supposed to...

725
01:33:46,740 --> 01:33:47,300
Oh!

726
01:33:48,740 --> 01:33:49,780
She's like a witch.

727
01:33:49,900 --> 01:33:50,980
I fucking knew it.

728
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:53,960
I knew she was a witch.

729
01:33:57,280 --> 01:33:57,920
Alright.

730
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:02,380
So, basically, I have to lit everything up.

731
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:05,560
I just have to lit everything up.

732
01:34:07,620 --> 01:34:08,260
So...

733
01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:11,480
I have to lit everything up.

734
01:34:11,540 --> 01:34:13,800
And then, like, destroy the sprinkler system.

735
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:14,860
I knew it.

736
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:16,900
She's like the wicked witch of the West.

737
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:19,540
Where, um...

738
01:34:22,680 --> 01:34:25,240
Where basically, like, water dissolves her.

739
01:34:26,240 --> 01:34:27,640
So I have to lit it all up.

740
01:34:29,160 --> 01:34:31,420
And then free the world of evil.

741
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:34,560
Don't tell her that.

742
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:40,240
Look, she's the one that's dissolvable by water.

743
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:41,240
I don't make the rules.

744
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:47,900
I'm like Linda, the good witch.

745
01:34:51,340 --> 01:34:53,980
Yeah, it's from Wizard of Oz.

746
01:34:57,480 --> 01:34:58,560
Okay, like...

747
01:34:58,560 --> 01:34:59,760
But will that...

748
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:00,520
Okay, wait.

749
01:35:01,680 --> 01:35:03,400
Do I just, like, go back then?

750
01:35:06,460 --> 01:35:07,600
Oh my god, like, where...

751
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:08,280
How do I get home?

752
01:35:11,480 --> 01:35:13,300
That's why she hates water

753
01:35:19,460 --> 01:35:25,260
All right Because I feel like if I do all of that She's just gonna catch me here Yeah I gotta walk back

754
01:35:28,300 --> 01:35:38,620
Okay Gotta follow the chonkul The one I paid 50% more No I mean 1% more Not 50

755
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:45,240
Okay.

756
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:50,680
That should work, right?

757
01:35:54,200 --> 01:35:55,720
And then...

758
01:35:55,720 --> 01:35:56,760
Wait, what?

759
01:35:57,780 --> 01:35:59,180
What the fuck happened?

760
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:02,880
I'm so...

761
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:07,920
Oh, I have to destroy the sprinklers first.

762
01:36:08,620 --> 01:36:09,000
Oh!

763
01:36:09,640 --> 01:36:11,200
I figured it out.

764
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:12,780
I'm going to re-check.

765
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,700
It's all natural.

766
01:36:15,660 --> 01:36:17,420
Alright, Chonkun, get over here.

767
01:36:21,090 --> 01:36:22,090
Alright, don't worry.

768
01:36:23,190 --> 01:36:28,890
My hypothesis that I figured out by myself is that I do all the sprinklers.

769
01:36:29,430 --> 01:36:31,090
I do the sprinkler first.

770
01:36:31,730 --> 01:36:33,410
And then, the fire.

771
01:36:35,650 --> 01:36:37,830
Alright, don't do the fire first.

772
01:36:38,590 --> 01:36:39,670
Do the sprinkler.

773
01:36:40,530 --> 01:36:43,610
Do the hypothesis that I constructed.

774
01:36:46,350 --> 01:36:47,110
yeah

775
01:36:50,210 --> 01:37:21,910
all right nice I don't bump it's like Totoro we're like Totoro me and my friend okay suddenly second-guessing my team's decision to make a puzzle game this is a lie we knew all a lie you all knew what was gonna happen all right nice we did it I'm so smart It was truly a Doki-proof game.

776
01:37:24,910 --> 01:37:26,490
Well, the chain is already on fire.

777
01:37:26,690 --> 01:37:28,490
I don't think I can put it on fire twice.

778
01:37:31,990 --> 01:37:32,350
Two.

779
01:37:33,610 --> 01:37:33,970
Three.

780
01:37:38,170 --> 01:37:38,710
That's right.

781
01:37:40,150 --> 01:37:41,130
That's fucking right.

782
01:37:42,350 --> 01:37:43,490
Burn, you witch.

783
01:37:44,290 --> 01:37:44,590
Burn!

784
01:37:45,410 --> 01:37:45,830
What happened?

785
01:37:45,930 --> 01:37:46,690
So I just let her.

786
01:37:47,550 --> 01:37:48,490
What happens?

787
01:37:51,170 --> 01:37:52,410
She's a ghost.

788
01:37:52,630 --> 01:37:55,170
She's not gonna die in a fire.

789
01:37:56,030 --> 01:37:57,650
It'll just go through her.

790
01:37:58,050 --> 01:38:00,310
Goodbye, the wicked witch of the West.

791
01:38:00,990 --> 01:38:01,770
I did it.

792
01:38:01,790 --> 01:38:02,950
I saved everybody.

793
01:38:03,170 --> 01:38:03,750
I'm a hero.

794
01:38:04,270 --> 01:38:05,870
Yeah, she's already dead.

795
01:38:06,310 --> 01:38:08,170
It's not like she can die again.

796
01:38:08,390 --> 01:38:09,910
She's not gonna go to hell, hell.

797
01:38:10,610 --> 01:38:11,670
The double hell.

798
01:38:16,870 --> 01:38:17,530
That's a...

799
01:38:17,550 --> 01:38:18,490
looking great.

800
01:38:19,150 --> 01:38:19,970
That's right.

801
01:38:21,510 --> 01:38:23,230
That's right, man.

802
01:38:26,510 --> 01:38:28,570
Alright, get over here.

803
01:38:29,150 --> 01:38:31,210
We kidnapped you for ransom money.

804
01:38:32,190 --> 01:38:32,590
Where is he?

805
01:38:32,650 --> 01:38:33,290
She in my chest.

806
01:38:33,590 --> 01:38:35,350
Guys, I swear to God she's not dead.

807
01:38:35,830 --> 01:38:38,650
I swear to God, I'm not gonna cut her body parts.

808
01:38:41,090 --> 01:38:44,210
I swear to God, she is very much alive in this bag.

809
01:38:45,970 --> 01:38:47,050
No shot.

810
01:38:49,850 --> 01:39:22,520
that's in the trash bag she was already dead what do you mean she's a ghost oh no i gotta escape oh my god i think this is a hard one because like they are so are you no no guys don't keep proof this right now them 50% bigger.

811
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:25,740
Not that way.

812
01:39:25,940 --> 01:39:27,200
Where is the exit?

813
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:30,640
Where is the exit?

814
01:39:30,900 --> 01:39:32,460
I thought this was the exit.

815
01:39:38,710 --> 01:39:39,750
Where is...

816
01:39:41,770 --> 01:39:42,810
Oh my god.

817
01:39:42,910 --> 01:39:44,010
It was the same room.

818
01:39:44,230 --> 01:39:44,390
Okay.

819
01:39:45,130 --> 01:39:45,430
Alright.

820
01:39:45,550 --> 01:39:45,870
Don't worry.

821
01:39:45,950 --> 01:39:46,770
Now that we know.

822
01:39:46,850 --> 01:39:47,450
God damn it.

823
01:39:47,610 --> 01:39:49,230
Now that we know.

824
01:39:50,210 --> 01:39:51,330
That was me.

825
01:39:51,430 --> 01:39:51,990
I got.

826
01:39:52,010 --> 01:39:53,370
I did it, boss.

827
01:39:53,910 --> 01:39:54,630
Yippee, yippee.

828
01:39:55,170 --> 01:39:56,270
I did it.

829
01:39:57,610 --> 01:40:03,730
As I need a yellow paint, please make a dokeyproof version where there's a giant arrow pointing at the exit.

830
01:40:03,850 --> 01:40:05,030
Don't worry, I can wait.

831
01:40:07,090 --> 01:40:08,070
Don't worry.

832
01:40:08,450 --> 01:40:09,190
I can't wait.

833
01:40:09,570 --> 01:40:13,110
I'll play another game while you put a giant yellow.

834
01:40:13,290 --> 01:40:16,710
But just give me this level in the dokey patch.

835
01:40:18,030 --> 01:40:19,390
Dokey, please.

836
01:40:19,390 --> 01:40:50,050
and I want a giant yellow arrow to point me to the other door and then like a sign that says exit here we had one but we didn't want to make the player feel stupid it could just be for me it could be a be like this is the dokey patch just for dokey And then it's just a giant yellow paint arrow to be like,

837
01:40:50,210 --> 01:40:51,830
please go here.

838
01:40:53,650 --> 01:40:57,590
And then the chunk moves be like 50% bigger.

839
01:40:59,210 --> 01:41:00,710
Enable Doki mode.

840
01:41:04,750 --> 01:41:07,530
Patch for Doki's eyes only.

841
01:41:07,890 --> 01:41:09,770
So no cheating, Dragoons.

842
01:41:10,870 --> 01:41:14,150
Do you want normal difficulty or Doki difficulty?

843
01:41:14,710 --> 01:41:14,890
Okay.

844
01:41:18,760 --> 01:41:51,800
all right don't worry i got this okay you do this this oh we're so smart we're gonna do a first try on this area my very first time doing this part all right don't keep that she's invisible uncatchable has a map has a mini map walk through walls and I feel like every Doki Jam game should have a Doki mode.

845
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:57,560
That should be the rule.

846
01:41:58,540 --> 01:42:02,620
Next Doki Jam, have normal mode and then Doki mode.

847
01:42:04,100 --> 01:42:05,940
I think that would be really fun.

848
01:42:07,160 --> 01:42:07,800
Alright, nice.

849
01:42:08,280 --> 01:42:09,960
I'll put her in my body bag again.

850
01:42:11,340 --> 01:42:12,780
Oh, it's right here.

851
01:42:12,820 --> 01:42:13,960
Okay, I found the door.

852
01:42:17,560 --> 01:42:18,140
yellow paint.

853
01:42:18,360 --> 01:42:21,280
Next theme is like, it's gonna be called yellow paint.

854
01:42:23,700 --> 01:42:24,400
Okay, the door open.

855
01:42:24,620 --> 01:42:25,300
Oh, thank God.

856
01:42:27,220 --> 01:42:28,320
Yeah, God.

857
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:29,660
No, it's not God mode.

858
01:42:29,860 --> 01:42:30,720
It's toky mode.

859
01:42:31,960 --> 01:42:33,560
Got her in my body bag.

860
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:34,840
Yay!

861
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:36,140
I did it!

862
01:42:36,220 --> 01:42:39,440
It only took me 30 minutes.

863
01:42:42,980 --> 01:42:43,460
Yay!

864
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:46,460
It said dead or alive, okay?

865
01:42:47,020 --> 01:42:50,360
Oh, shit oh never mind it's extra dead

866
01:42:53,420 --> 01:42:58,280

01:43:03,900 --> 01:43:08,340

868
01:43:12,740 --> 01:43:18,860
i'm like why does she get to take off her sports bra i don't don't understand.

869
01:43:22,740 --> 01:43:25,580
Or, I think you gave it a super chat.

870
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:25,920
Thank you.

871
01:43:26,260 --> 01:43:26,380
Thank you.

872
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:27,800
That was really fun.

873
01:43:27,960 --> 01:43:44,240
I really enjoyed this first game and, like, going, doing all the puzzles and the little... I like the little references to, like, all the all, like, the like, the Easter eggs around, like, me and my friends and stuff.

874
01:43:44,500 --> 01:43:45,800
So, it was a really fun game.

875
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:46,580
I love it.

876
01:43:46,920 --> 01:43:47,420
Alright.

877
01:43:47,560 --> 01:43:48,620
Next game.

878
01:43:49,340 --> 01:43:50,180
Next meme.

879
01:43:51,420 --> 01:43:53,760
But thank you again for making this game.

880
01:43:53,900 --> 01:43:54,900
It was very, very fun.

881
01:43:55,040 --> 01:43:56,320
I really appreciate it.

882
01:43:56,760 --> 01:43:57,100
All right.

883
01:43:57,820 --> 01:44:04,660
I think I love the, I love the, like, you even made like a little custom mint bottle too, which was really cute.

884
01:44:05,300 --> 01:44:05,640
All right.

Mine tunnel.

918
01:47:18,860 --> 01:47:20,260
Zero survivability skills.

919
01:47:20,340 --> 01:47:21,340
As always, Doki.

920
01:47:22,740 --> 01:47:23,460
Oh, there's...

921
01:47:23,460 --> 01:47:23,620
Okay.

922
01:47:27,160 --> 01:47:28,240
Ah, yes.

923
01:47:28,600 --> 01:47:33,420
I never forget to bring my most important equipment.

924
01:47:33,520 --> 01:47:35,360
A shotgun and a revolver.

925
01:47:35,960 --> 01:47:36,300
Alright.

926
01:47:36,660 --> 01:47:37,080

01:47:38,600 --> 01:47:39,560
Aim bot on.

929
01:47:40,460 --> 01:47:43,320
Like, don't worry about me, Dad.

930
01:47:45,820 --> 01:48:18,400
take care of yourself all right master return a menu just wanted to make sure is it what the settings were wait oh let's go back to the story part stay here dad all right enemies are balls in this game the enemies are represented by balls you have to place pegs on a game area to bounce the ball if the balls fall on the board you will take damage when a ball bounces on a peg the enemy it's representing will take damage.

931
01:48:18,720 --> 01:48:19,600
Okay, drag and drop.

932
01:48:20,320 --> 01:48:22,940
Open, click and drag an item from an inventory slot to a ball.

933
01:48:23,140 --> 01:48:25,100
You can right-click a peg to send him back.

934
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:27,140
You can't place the pegs too close.

935
01:48:27,780 --> 01:48:30,240
Areas from multiple pegs cannot be colliding.

936
01:48:30,980 --> 01:48:34,520
Set your pegs in a way to stop balls from falling to defeat the enemy.

937
01:48:35,460 --> 01:48:36,920
When you're done adjusting, click start.

938
01:48:37,580 --> 01:48:37,580
Okay.

939
01:48:38,100 --> 01:48:39,120

He is free.

941
01:48:43,100 --> 01:48:46,180
Every type of peg you have has its own skills.

942
01:48:46,440 --> 01:49:01,920
Bounce way of balancing skills or powers that peg okay chain reaction using pegs that have energy progression all right i got this i figured it out close tutorial um

943
01:49:07,030 --> 01:49:14,190

944
01:49:18,080 --> 01:50:57,090

945
01:50:57,910 --> 01:50:58,550
That looks better.

946
01:51:00,590 --> 01:51:01,470
Next room.

947
01:51:04,270 --> 01:51:05,070

948
01:51:07,210 --> 01:51:09,670
Okay, we put this here.

949
01:51:10,090 --> 01:51:11,230
Okay, we put him here.

950
01:51:11,550 --> 01:51:12,830
Okay, we put him here.

951
01:51:13,530 --> 01:51:15,630
And then we put this here.

952
01:51:16,210 --> 01:51:17,130
And then we'll put it here.

953
01:51:17,830 --> 01:51:18,430
This should work.

954
01:51:20,250 --> 01:51:20,550
Okay.

955
01:51:21,250 --> 01:51:22,250

Alright.

958
01:51:28,360 --> 01:51:32,880
I'll put this here and then this here.

959
01:51:33,160 --> 01:51:33,840
This should kill him.

960
01:51:37,400 --> 01:51:42,240
All right, you don't need to see live reaction because I'm literally right here right now.

961
01:51:42,540 --> 01:51:43,700
Actually live.

962
01:51:46,180 --> 01:51:46,860
What do you mean?

963
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:48,780
I'm literally right here.

964
01:51:49,260 --> 01:51:55,500
I am the better live reaction because I'm literally live right now.

965
01:51:56,260 --> 01:51:56,620
Like...

966
01:51:59,360 --> 01:52:00,840
Like, what do you mean?

967
01:52:01,160 --> 01:52:02,020
We can't see the...

968
01:52:02,020 --> 01:52:04,300
You can't see my face right now!

969
01:52:05,620 --> 01:52:08,720
I want to see the live reaction.

970
01:52:09,520 --> 01:52:10,840
Yuki, get out of the way.

971
01:52:11,120 --> 01:52:12,960
I can't see Toki.

972
01:52:14,280 --> 01:52:16,900
It's not the same, Toki.

973
01:52:17,360 --> 01:52:21,000
We want to see the live Toki reaction.

974
01:52:23,020 --> 01:52:25,840
We got the Toki reaction at home.

975
01:52:26,100 --> 01:52:27,680
Oh, it's the Toki blade.

976
01:52:29,540 --> 01:53:01,880
bounce perpendicularly when activating skill this is not live it's pre-recorded slices a tomato slice off of the end the slice bounces around like a ball we'll start to HP if it falls off the ball there can only one slice per knife at okay we can let's grab that that sounds good other Tokyo abuses you don't know that that's just fucking dope She's a Doki from Dokiverse.

977
01:53:02,220 --> 01:53:03,660
We're all the same.

978
01:53:06,980 --> 01:53:07,260
Alright.

979
01:53:11,360 --> 01:53:14,520

01:53:17,580 --> 01:53:18,480
Alright, let's see.

981
01:53:20,500 --> 01:53:21,480
Wait, I think that...

982
01:53:21,480 --> 01:53:22,760
Did I run out of ammo?

983
01:53:25,240 --> 01:53:26,260
What is...

984
01:53:26,260 --> 01:53:27,100
Wait, what is...

985
01:53:29,780 --> 01:54:16,960

988
01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:28,760
Downs the closest enemy and deal damage.

989
01:55:29,020 --> 01:55:31,760
Damage and buffs go up for every enemy defeated this game.

990
01:55:32,220 --> 01:55:35,820
When an enemy is defeated, while another enemy is live, trigger every other peg skill.

991
01:55:35,860 --> 01:55:36,960
Okay, that seems better.

992
01:55:38,340 --> 01:55:40,480
But she came to our tunnel.

993
01:55:41,020 --> 01:55:41,760
I don't know.

994
01:55:45,900 --> 01:55:47,020
This is...

995
01:55:47,020 --> 01:55:47,640
I understand.

996
01:55:47,960 --> 01:55:49,020
We live here.

997
01:55:50,840 --> 01:55:51,880
Don't worry, guys.

998
01:55:51,960 --> 01:55:52,820
I'm a hero.

1000
01:55:54,280 --> 01:55:55,160
I am here.

1001
01:55:55,420 --> 01:55:56,720
This is self-defense.

1002
01:55:56,800 --> 01:55:57,300
guys.

1003
01:55:57,560 --> 01:56:05,480
I say as I do a home invasion, I this is self-defense.

1004
01:56:07,460 --> 01:56:09,300
Good point.

1005
01:56:13,680 --> 01:56:15,220
Okay, now it's dead.

1006
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:20,240

Alright.

1009
01:56:28,020 --> 01:56:29,580
I think this is a good start.

1010
01:56:33,400 --> 01:56:34,040
Alright, nice.

1011
01:56:34,840 --> 01:56:36,680
Alright, I got extra kill there.

1012
01:56:37,780 --> 01:56:39,400

Stop trespassing in our tunnel.

1017
01:56:53,240 --> 01:56:56,780
Alright, every time a ball hits, there's 5% chance.

1018
01:56:56,800 --> 01:56:57,860
has to bounce all back.

1019
01:56:57,960 --> 01:57:00,460
Okay, we didn't have, we didn't grab this yet, so I'll try it out.

02:00:19,670 --> 02:00:30,610
okay nice nice okay one shot simple geometry was not as simple as i expected guys guys i don't think i'm going to make it to stage 19.

1043
02:00:31,170 --> 02:00:39,830
i Who would have thought simple geometry was not as simple as I expected.

1044
02:00:43,250 --> 02:00:44,170
Oh, no.

1045
02:00:44,490 --> 02:00:46,210
This ain't looking so good.

1046
02:00:49,710 --> 02:00:50,350
Okay.

1047
02:00:50,550 --> 02:00:52,130
I don't think it could fit another.

1048
02:00:53,390 --> 02:00:54,690
I'll put this one.

1049
02:00:55,170 --> 02:00:58,010
I don't think it could fit another trophy in.

1050
02:01:04,380 --> 02:01:05,020
JK.

1051
02:01:05,240 --> 02:01:07,560
I don't think I could fit this one in too.

1052
02:01:08,040 --> 02:01:08,320
Okay.

1053
02:01:09,320 --> 02:01:18,060
if I move it like this oh no okay oh this is bad I can't okay wait I got an idea

1054
02:01:23,270 --> 02:01:29,620
okay oh my god it's so close

1055
02:01:33,950 --> 02:01:39,310
if I shift everything higher will that fuck me over it let's see but

1056
02:01:43,790 --> 02:01:46,170
last time I shift stuff pie.

1057
02:01:46,610 --> 02:01:48,350
It was not so good for me.

1058
02:01:48,850 --> 02:01:49,850
Alright, let's try.

1059
02:01:50,450 --> 02:01:51,710
This goes straight down.

1060
02:01:51,950 --> 02:01:52,950
I don't know.

1061
02:01:56,730 --> 02:02:00,770
I'm a little worried because this goes all the way down.

1062
02:02:02,570 --> 02:02:06,270
And then we'll put that right here.

1063
02:02:06,630 --> 02:02:08,270
Surely this will start something.

1064
02:02:11,890 --> 02:02:12,310
Okay.

1065
02:02:14,530 --> 02:02:15,530
Oh no.

1066
02:02:15,710 --> 02:02:16,650
Okay, 16.

1067
02:02:18,810 --> 02:02:20,330
We'll put that here.

1068
02:02:21,630 --> 02:02:21,990
All right.

1069
02:02:22,970 --> 02:02:24,330
That's okay.

1070
02:02:24,910 --> 02:02:27,470
I'm hanging by the thread right now.

1071
02:02:29,530 --> 02:02:30,850
Just don't go straight down.

1072
02:02:31,270 --> 02:02:33,750
Just don't go straight down.

1073
02:02:36,050 --> 02:02:37,050
All right, keep the dice.

1074
02:02:37,550 --> 02:02:38,070
That's good.

1075
02:02:42,620 --> 02:02:43,020
Okay.

1076
02:02:45,440 --> 02:02:47,800
I think that hits it.

1077
02:02:48,680 --> 02:02:49,640
Okay, thank God.

1078
02:02:49,720 --> 02:02:50,180
Oh, my God.

1079
02:02:50,320 --> 02:02:51,380
It's going so fast.

1080
02:02:51,760 --> 02:02:52,380
Oh, thank God.

1081
02:02:52,480 --> 02:02:53,760
Okay, that's fine.

1082
02:02:57,560 --> 02:02:59,380
This game, yeah.

1083
02:03:02,440 --> 02:03:06,580
Um, oh, man.

1084
02:03:06,720 --> 02:03:10,120
I don't have room for... Okay, let's see how much space Kroki takes.

1085
02:03:10,520 --> 02:03:11,780
Maybe Kroki is tiny.

1086
02:03:16,060 --> 02:03:16,980
Oh, my God.

1087
02:03:17,120 --> 02:03:17,440
Okay.

1088
02:03:18,320 --> 02:03:21,000
I don't think I can shift him anywhere.

1089
02:03:22,120 --> 02:03:26,920
You're not you're not living here, I guess I think

1090
02:03:32,130 --> 02:03:41,160
Okay, yeah, this works this works That just fell straight oh my god

1091
02:03:44,780 --> 02:04:16,060
You guys it didn't work it didn't work it fell straight down I believe it my simple geometry wasn't simple I can't believe it who would have thought it wasn't simple at all

1112
02:07:45,410 --> 02:07:52,690
Based on your choices throughout the game, chain reactions will occur, changing the outcome of Doki's story.

1113
02:07:53,090 --> 02:08:00,630
All right, and the developers are one that eats you for director programming, Cloud Lime for design, pixel art writing,

Wait, why is the music?

1119
02:09:38,650 --> 02:09:40,030

1120
02:09:40,490 --> 02:09:41,110
Oh, there you go.

1133
02:10:31,030 --> 02:10:35,290
chain reactions will occur, changing the outcome of Joki's story.

1134
02:10:37,750 --> 02:10:38,710
Oh, look, there's tomato.

1135

It's like, pew, pew, pew, pew.

1144
02:10:53,130 --> 02:10:56,070
My mood... How did that decrease my mood?

1145
02:10:56,290 --> 02:10:58,270

02:11:33,970 --> 02:11:34,910
Let's go gambling.

1150
02:11:35,490 --> 02:11:37,270
Actually, should I really make a bet?

1151
02:11:37,790 --> 02:11:38,110
Yes.

1152
02:11:38,610 --> 02:11:41,930
No, save your money like a fucking loser.

1153
02:11:43,450 --> 02:11:44,430
Yes, obviously.

1154
02:11:45,270 --> 02:11:46,650
Okay, it looks like I need to choose a number.

1155
02:11:46,850 --> 02:11:48,230
Only one choice will win.

1156
02:11:48,690 --> 02:11:49,070
Boobs.

1157
02:11:50,310 --> 02:11:52,550
Maybe one day it'll be boobs, guys.

1158
02:11:53,130 --> 02:11:54,390
This is today.

1159
02:11:55,090 --> 02:11:57,910
Guys, today it will finally be boobs.

1160
02:11:58,170 --> 02:11:59,310

1161
02:12:00,450 --> 02:12:03,270
What do you mean it's not boobs?

1162
02:12:07,670 --> 02:12:08,870
Money decreased by...

1163
02:12:08,870 --> 02:12:11,150
Oh my god, I'm so depressed!

1164
02:12:12,530 --> 02:12:15,510
Can we rest by playing Marvel Rivals?

1165
02:12:15,750 --> 02:12:17,450
Moot increased by four.

1166
02:12:17,650 --> 02:12:18,470
I'm so...

1167
02:12:18,470 --> 02:12:20,970
Why is it not boobs?

1168
02:12:21,870 --> 02:12:23,470
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

1169
02:12:23,470 --> 02:12:24,810
Pew, pew.

1170
02:12:24,810 --> 02:12:27,090
Okay, money moved decreased by one.

1171
02:12:28,690 --> 02:12:29,310
Hey, the dragon.

1172
02:12:29,570 --> 02:12:30,950
Look, Doki's got new merch.

1173
02:12:31,090 --> 02:12:31,890
Buy my merch.

1174
02:12:32,650 --> 02:12:35,650
Today I'm selling one-of-kind exclusive new main.

1175
02:12:36,830 --> 02:12:37,310
Help!

1176
02:12:38,950 --> 02:12:40,470
See, she even talks.

1177
02:12:40,690 --> 02:12:41,150
Look at that.

1178
02:12:41,230 --> 02:12:43,350
If you press a button, she also makes noises.

1179
02:12:43,550 --> 02:12:44,390
Do I at least get a cut?

1180
02:12:44,650 --> 02:12:44,670
No.

1181
02:12:45,270 --> 02:12:47,490
Maybe we can figure that out later.

1182
02:12:48,070 --> 02:12:50,410
You'll regret this Doki burn.

1183
02:12:51,630 --> 02:12:53,410
Moon increased by two.

1184
02:12:53,410 --> 02:12:54,250
Yeah, that's accurate.

1185
02:12:54,590 --> 02:12:56,510
I sold mid and I got happier.

1186
02:12:59,570 --> 02:13:00,830

1187
02:13:01,990 --> 02:13:01,990
Yay!

1188
02:13:02,590 --> 02:13:05,150
Five nights at Freddy's.

1189
02:13:05,550 --> 02:13:06,850
Put her in and in her.

1190
02:13:08,310 --> 02:13:10,070
Joki's watching dad at home.

1191
02:13:10,450 --> 02:13:10,930
It's so cute.

1192
02:13:11,010 --> 02:13:12,250
I love the graphics.

1193
02:13:12,450 --> 02:13:14,210
The graphics are so fucking cute.

1194
02:13:16,410 --> 02:13:18,690
There seems to be a dark spot under him.

1195
02:13:19,110 --> 02:13:19,610
Dad.

1196
02:13:20,650 --> 02:13:21,690

02:13:22,210 --> 02:13:23,230
Not the table!

1199
02:13:24,230 --> 02:13:24,710

02:17:16,580 --> 02:17:19,400
What the fuck is this bullshit?

1268
02:17:20,860 --> 02:17:22,820

1286
02:18:46,460 --> 02:18:50,280
Why did I gamble on boobs?

1287
02:18:51,500 --> 02:18:55,200
I thought today was the boob day.

1288
02:18:55,620 --> 02:18:59,660
You know what I was like one day it will be boobs.

1289
02:18:59,860 --> 02:19:08,700
I thought today was that day I can't believe it today was not the day

1290
02:19:14,140 --> 02:19:22,740
I can't believe it should I went for boobies one day, but not today.

1291
02:19:23,500 --> 02:19:28,660
I can't believe it It finally, it wasn't today!

1292
02:19:31,820 --> 02:19:35,100
When will it ever be booze?

1293
02:19:35,840 --> 02:19:37,180
Oh my god.

1294
02:19:37,380 --> 02:19:38,460
That was really fun.

1295
02:19:39,600 --> 02:19:51,880
I, um, I have, um, I want to say like for that game, um, I want to say I love the all, I love the writing for that game and the artwork.

1296
02:19:52,180 --> 02:19:53,400
It was so cute.

1297
02:19:53,500 --> 02:19:55,480
The artwork was really, really cute.

1298
02:19:55,620 --> 02:19:58,900
And I definitely love the writing.

1299
02:19:58,980 --> 02:19:59,900
It was very Lord Accurate.

1300
02:20:00,040 --> 02:20:07,000
I felt like whoever wrote for the game really knew my personality very, really well because I was like making comments.

1301
02:20:07,180 --> 02:20:11,460
And then literally the next line was me almost saying that exact line.

1302
02:20:13,100 --> 02:20:14,640
So whoever, and the music too.

1303
02:20:14,720 --> 02:20:16,640

02:20:17,960 --> 02:20:22,660
The little like pet simulator and all the little events and references and stuff.

1306
02:20:23,020 --> 02:20:25,500
And I guess like, and there's like definitely replayability.

1307
02:20:25,620 --> 02:21:32,900

02:27:31,300 --> 02:27:31,720
Okay, wait.

1367
02:27:31,760 --> 02:27:33,340
I'll show you guys what he looks like.

1368
02:27:33,780 --> 02:27:35,280
He's a very angry egg.

1369
02:27:36,360 --> 02:27:38,360
You could tell he's very angry.

1370
02:27:40,980 --> 02:27:41,540
Just...

1371
02:27:42,120 --> 02:27:45,880
You've been a blind rage all week after someone stole your Chinese food?

1372
02:27:46,160 --> 02:27:47,940
Who could do such a thing?

1373
02:27:50,440 --> 02:27:51,420
Oh my...

1374
02:27:51,420 --> 02:27:51,780
Oh, wait.

1375
02:27:51,900 --> 02:27:52,600
I did it.

1376
02:27:52,620 --> 02:27:54,920
Oh, shit.

1377
02:27:55,100 --> 02:28:01,190
Ah, my dad is just there witnessing my crimes.

1378
02:28:03,150 --> 02:28:04,030
Nice dad.

1379
02:28:04,330 --> 02:28:05,110
Let's go.

1380
02:28:06,630 --> 02:28:08,090
Who would do that?

1381
02:28:09,530 --> 02:28:10,410
Another dragon.

1382
02:28:11,270 --> 02:28:11,930
Oh, shit.

1383
02:28:12,010 --> 02:28:14,390
Wait, I was going to show you guys what he looks like.

1384
02:28:14,930 --> 02:28:15,470
Oh, my God.

1385
02:28:15,510 --> 02:28:16,730
Are you going to rob someone?

1386
02:28:17,810 --> 02:28:18,310
Wait, no.

1387
02:28:18,390 --> 02:28:19,170
This is a fake.

1388
02:28:19,390 --> 02:28:20,710
Wait, is that actually a dragon?

1389
02:28:21,590 --> 02:28:22,710
Why are you blue?

1390
02:28:23,470 --> 02:28:24,910
Is this a whisper gun?

1391
02:28:25,050 --> 02:29:29,430
and what yeah what are you wearing why exactly why are you blue i wasn't always like this i felt pressured by the toxic beauty standards of society everywhere i went there were billboards and ads of beautiful multicolored creatures and i just wanted to be purple but then the dye i went missing who could do such a thing because I didn't steal it not me that was written there I don't know if you guys saw that but there's a little bit of a text glitch I had to buy a new one but the one I originally purchased was out of stock the color was the closest a purple I could get and look at me I'm ruined I wear this blue blah blah blah blah to hide my shame of being blue.

1392
02:29:30,410 --> 02:29:31,730
We can fix this.

1393
02:29:32,170 --> 02:29:35,790
You'll buy another hair dye with your money.

1394
02:29:37,210 --> 02:29:39,870
No, it's too late.

1395
02:29:41,190 --> 02:29:41,430
Alright.

1396
02:29:44,550 --> 02:29:45,390
Oh my god.

1397
02:29:45,790 --> 02:29:46,190
Don't worry.

1398
02:29:46,330 --> 02:29:46,590
Bob.

1399
02:29:47,330 --> 02:29:48,230
I know what to do.

1400
02:29:48,350 --> 02:29:49,430
I'll just kill him.

1401
02:29:51,410 --> 02:29:55,750
Guys, I know what to do to solve this.

1402
02:29:56,510 --> 02:29:59,830
I'll just put him out of his misery of being a blue.

1403
02:30:03,850 --> 02:30:04,950
Guys, don't worry.

1404
02:30:07,830 --> 02:30:10,050
Violence is always the ass.

1405
02:30:10,190 --> 02:30:10,890
Oh shit!

1406
02:30:11,470 --> 02:30:13,170
Oh my god, he's got a gun!

1407
02:30:16,110 --> 02:30:17,310
Holy shit!

1408
02:30:20,250 --> 02:30:23,130
What a fuck is that dragoon a gun!

1409
02:30:25,610 --> 02:30:28,810
Oh my god, that's fucking crazy!

1410
02:30:29,350 --> 02:30:30,430
Pop, pop!

1411
02:30:33,250 --> 02:30:33,930
Oh my god.

1412
02:30:34,210 --> 02:30:37,710
Oh, I don't have another...

1413
02:30:38,290 --> 02:30:39,370
There we go.

1414
02:30:39,850 --> 02:30:42,490
Not so armed and dangerous.

1415
02:30:44,170 --> 02:30:44,690
There we go.

1416
02:30:48,250 --> 02:30:50,750
No lies were lost in Dokiland.

1417
02:30:56,670 --> 02:30:58,150
Alright, there we go, nice.

1418
02:31:00,130 --> 02:31:01,030
Oh, hey, Doobie.

1419
02:31:01,830 --> 02:31:04,690
Oh, shit.

1420
02:31:07,810 --> 02:31:09,530
Now it's my train.

1421
02:31:11,550 --> 02:31:12,330
Hey, Doobie.

1422
02:31:13,730 --> 02:31:14,410
What do I get?

1423
02:31:14,890 --> 02:31:16,970
Click the price tag to purchase.

1424
02:31:17,650 --> 02:31:18,650
Thanks, you.

1425
02:31:18,810 --> 02:31:19,210
What?

1426
02:31:21,350 --> 02:31:23,270
I just wanted...

1427
02:31:23,270 --> 02:31:24,690
Oh, shit, the dokey knife.

1428
02:31:24,710 --> 02:31:25,390
Why nine?

1429
02:31:25,650 --> 02:31:26,950
Wait, how much money do I have?

1430
02:31:27,410 --> 02:31:27,890
200.

1431
02:31:28,510 --> 02:31:29,290
Bomb damage.

1432
02:31:29,610 --> 02:31:30,410
Oh, I'll grab.

1433
02:31:31,950 --> 02:31:32,850
Wait, how do I buy this?

1434
02:31:32,930 --> 02:31:33,190
Okay.

1435
02:31:33,710 --> 02:31:33,930
Nice.

1436
02:31:34,090 --> 02:31:35,390
Okay, bomb radius.

1437
02:31:36,390 --> 02:31:37,730
I like the...

1438
02:31:37,730 --> 02:31:39,630
Okay, I feel like piercing would be good.

1439
02:31:39,910 --> 02:31:40,590
I'll buy the piercing.

1440
02:31:41,830 --> 02:31:42,430
Alright, nice.

1441
02:31:43,770 --> 02:31:44,690
Goodbye, dude.

1442
02:31:45,790 --> 02:31:46,230
Oh, shit.

1443
02:31:47,830 --> 02:31:48,650
Goodbye, dude.

1444
02:31:50,210 --> 02:31:51,690
That was my train.

1445
02:31:53,490 --> 02:31:54,030
That was my train.

1446
02:31:56,750 --> 02:31:58,970
Okay, this is the new goon.

1447
02:31:59,710 --> 02:32:00,970
Oh, hey, Doki.

1448
02:32:03,490 --> 02:32:07,010
A dragoon, uh, what's with the armor?

1449
02:32:07,910 --> 02:32:09,190
It's a long story.

1450
02:32:09,430 --> 02:32:11,650
I won't waste your time explaining.

1451
02:32:12,530 --> 02:32:13,910
No, I want to hear.

1452
02:32:14,710 --> 02:32:19,230
If you insist, it all started with my passion for cooking.

1453
02:32:20,190 --> 02:32:24,010
And my hero, Chef Tim, offered me an opportunity.

1454
02:32:24,030 --> 02:32:25,370
to cook for him.

1455
02:32:25,750 --> 02:32:28,030
To prove my passion.

1456
02:32:28,670 --> 02:32:35,050
And if I succeeded, he would give me a job at Vite Rotman, a real dream come true.

1457
02:32:36,130 --> 02:32:45,010
I was going to make a midoscious, stavious, gelatinous noodle stew with a breast of a cow topped with mentha spiccata.

1458
02:32:45,570 --> 02:32:47,290
It's just beef carrot stew.

1459
02:32:47,970 --> 02:32:51,470
And the core ingredient was hot sauce.

1460
02:32:52,370 --> 02:32:55,830
But on a day that was private jet landed in my area.

1461
02:32:57,270 --> 02:33:00,490
My hot sauce was missing.

1462
02:33:01,290 --> 02:33:04,790
Who could do such a thing, dragoons?

1463
02:33:05,110 --> 02:33:07,230
I guess we'll never find out.

1464
02:33:07,830 --> 02:33:09,410
I made a subparamil.

1465
02:33:09,950 --> 02:33:16,490
And for that, my hero, Chef Tim, verbally abused me.

1466
02:33:17,170 --> 02:33:19,990
It was a pain like no other.

1467
02:33:20,550 --> 02:33:57,190
I started therapy, art therapy, group therapy physical therapy accelerated experimental dynamic psychotherapy and the only thing that stopped my pain was to shut myself off from the rest of the world i swore i never let anyone hurt me again i put on this armor to symbolize this no that's horrible I'm... What the fuck did I do?

1468
02:33:58,410 --> 02:33:59,470
Yeah, what?

1469
02:33:59,990 --> 02:34:00,410
What?

1470
02:34:01,210 --> 02:34:02,250
No reason.

1471
02:34:02,790 --> 02:34:03,650
This just...

1472
02:34:03,650 --> 02:34:07,210
This game just needs more enemy.

1473
02:34:07,710 --> 02:34:10,030
The plus 999 defense.

1474
02:34:10,390 --> 02:34:11,350
Alright, don't wear a piercing.

1475
02:34:12,250 --> 02:34:12,710
Look at that.

1476
02:34:13,010 --> 02:34:14,030
Oh my god, wait.

1477
02:34:16,790 --> 02:34:17,970
That's right.

1478
02:34:18,350 --> 02:34:21,290
That defense is doing nothing for you.

1479
02:34:22,430 --> 02:34:23,490
That's God...

1480
02:34:23,490 --> 02:34:24,010
Oh my god.

1481
02:34:24,030 --> 02:34:24,730
He explode.

1482
02:34:24,930 --> 02:34:25,630
Oh shit.

1483
02:34:25,970 --> 02:34:26,770
Oh shit.

1484
02:34:27,030 --> 02:34:28,190
Oh my god.

1485
02:34:28,330 --> 02:34:34,090
Okay, this is a lot of shit right now Oh my guys, this is bad.

1486
02:34:34,390 --> 02:34:36,410

02:34:44,790 --> 02:34:45,750
It's actually the guns.

1490
02:34:48,830 --> 02:34:52,590
It's oh My god the RNG you guys just fought in front of me.

Of course, Longoon is a nerd.

1493
02:35:25,690 --> 02:35:26,430
Not you too.

1494
02:35:26,810 --> 02:35:28,170
What happened to you?

1495
02:35:29,770 --> 02:35:31,690
What happened to me?

1496
02:35:32,330 --> 02:35:33,470
He's a wizard.

1497
02:35:37,310 --> 02:35:38,710
I'm a what?

1498
02:35:42,440 --> 02:35:50,060
I became my strongest self after someone left their firecracker in my toilet.

1499
02:35:51,420 --> 02:35:56,140
It exploded as I softly placed my behind on the toilet seat.

1500
02:35:56,700 --> 02:35:59,380
I was sent flying through a wall.

1501
02:36:00,060 --> 02:36:07,420
And through that wall, I discovered a secret room where a gnome was secretly living under my roof.

1502
02:36:08,040 --> 02:36:11,920
I had the most powerful, wonderful conversation with that gnome.

1503
02:36:12,420 --> 02:36:16,640
We talked about the stars and planets and our favorite constellation.

1504
02:36:17,420 --> 02:36:19,340
It was romantic.

1505
02:36:21,420 --> 02:37:24,840

1506
02:37:28,260 --> 02:37:28,980
Oh, no.

1507
02:37:29,120 --> 02:37:30,640
Who could do such a thing, guys?

1508
02:37:30,940 --> 02:37:34,960
We gotta find the menace who keeps doing all these things to the dragons.

1509
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:37,020
Holy shit!

1510
02:37:37,660 --> 02:37:38,520
Oh, I'm dead.

1511
02:37:38,680 --> 02:37:39,820
I am so dead.

1512
02:37:40,280 --> 02:37:40,800
Oh, my.

1513
02:37:40,880 --> 02:37:41,580
I'm not.

1514
02:37:41,720 --> 02:37:44,100
I don't think I'm living this, guys.

1515
02:37:48,520 --> 02:37:50,220
Oh, oh, my God.

1516
02:37:50,280 --> 02:37:51,320
This is not looking good.

1517
02:37:51,820 --> 02:37:52,820
This is not looking good.

1518
02:37:52,880 --> 02:37:54,200
for the story of Doki Bird.

1519
02:37:54,620 --> 02:37:54,920
Dad, please.

1520
02:37:55,400 --> 02:37:55,940
Dad, please.

1521
02:37:56,520 --> 02:37:57,620
I really, please.

1522
02:37:58,220 --> 02:37:58,420
Please.

1523
02:37:58,600 --> 02:37:59,120
Oh, my God.

1524
02:37:59,220 --> 02:38:00,500
Please stop spawning in front of me.

1525
02:38:00,820 --> 02:38:01,520
Oh, my God.

1526
02:38:01,680 --> 02:38:02,300
No, no.

1527
02:38:02,380 --> 02:38:03,220
Not the rage.

1528
02:38:03,640 --> 02:38:04,520
Not the rage.

1529
02:38:05,020 --> 02:38:06,040
Anything but the rage.

1530
02:38:06,500 --> 02:38:06,980
How do I...

1531
02:38:10,900 --> 02:38:12,340
Not the magic.

1532
02:38:13,600 --> 02:38:14,900
Oh, my God.

1533
02:38:14,980 --> 02:38:15,920
That's not fair.

1534
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:20,160
He spawned in front of me.

1535
02:38:21,560 --> 02:38:22,160
Hmm.

1536
02:38:22,880 --> 02:38:23,300
Okay.

1537
02:38:24,240 --> 02:38:26,960
Oh, now you find me heels, Dad.

1538
02:38:29,780 --> 02:38:30,360
Okay.

1539
02:38:30,960 --> 02:38:31,480
That's fine.

1540
02:38:32,660 --> 02:38:33,360
It's fine.

1541
02:38:33,700 --> 02:38:33,920
Nice.

1542
02:38:35,060 --> 02:38:36,280
We did it.

1543
02:38:37,180 --> 02:38:37,720
We did it.

1544
02:38:37,740 --> 02:38:39,120
There's heels now.

1545
02:38:39,860 --> 02:38:40,860
Oh, we're so healthy.

1546
02:38:41,720 --> 02:38:42,880
We're so healthy.

1547
02:38:43,060 --> 02:38:43,540
Oh, my God.

1548
02:38:43,820 --> 02:38:44,260
Thank God.

1549
02:38:44,720 --> 02:38:45,280
Thank God.

1550
02:38:45,560 --> 02:38:46,260
Dad found heels.

1551
02:38:47,420 --> 02:38:47,720
There we go.

1552
02:38:47,760 --> 02:38:48,520
Chain reaction.

1553
02:38:50,100 --> 02:38:50,640
Pew, pew, pew.

1554
02:38:50,880 --> 02:38:51,620
Pop, pop.

1555
02:38:51,740 --> 02:38:52,500
Pew, pew.

1556
02:38:52,880 --> 02:38:55,560
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, just cue pewing.

1557
02:38:58,600 --> 02:38:59,560
That's fucking right.

1558
02:39:00,340 --> 02:39:01,000
There we go.

1559
02:39:01,580 --> 02:39:01,980
We're doing it.

1560
02:39:02,120 --> 02:39:03,120
We're figuring out the rhythm.

1561
02:39:06,140 --> 02:39:06,580
Oh my god.

1562
02:39:06,640 --> 02:39:07,180
Oh my god.

1563
02:39:07,380 --> 02:39:08,180
There's two guns.

1564
02:39:08,560 --> 02:39:09,620
There's two goons.

1565
02:39:10,380 --> 02:39:11,220
There's two dudes.

1566
02:39:13,200 --> 02:39:15,520
How the fuck do I dodge that?

1567
02:39:16,980 --> 02:39:18,060
Okay, that's bullshit.

1568
02:39:19,120 --> 02:39:19,580
Alright.

1569
02:39:20,860 --> 02:39:21,940

1573
02:39:55,300 --> 02:39:57,080
And I can't afford anything else.

1574
02:39:57,180 --> 02:39:57,600
Let's go.

1575
02:39:59,080 --> 02:40:00,340
I got the Joki 99.

1576
02:40:03,520 --> 02:40:04,140
Oh, Min.

1577
02:40:04,720 --> 02:40:06,460
I'm so glad I found you.

1578
02:40:06,620 --> 02:40:07,560
Wait, what's wrong with Min?

1579
02:40:07,680 --> 02:40:08,480
Where's your eyes?

1580
02:40:09,440 --> 02:40:11,020
It's been chaos up there.

1581
02:40:12,500 --> 02:40:14,900
All the dragoons have been thirsty for blood.

1582
02:40:16,480 --> 02:40:16,540
Min?

1583
02:40:18,180 --> 02:40:19,060
Oh, shit!

1584
02:40:20,900 --> 02:40:22,040
What the fuck?

1585
02:40:24,580 --> 02:40:25,820
Oh, no, not Toho.

1586
02:40:26,100 --> 02:40:28,120
Not, of course, Mitsa's Toho's.

1587
02:40:28,220 --> 02:40:28,940
God damn Toho.

1588
02:40:31,200 --> 02:40:32,620
A fucking course.

1589
02:40:34,020 --> 02:40:35,020
Oh, my gosh.

1590
02:40:36,040 --> 02:40:37,380
Okay, this is strong as hell.

1591
02:40:37,460 --> 02:40:38,120
Not gonna lie.

1592
02:40:38,240 --> 02:40:39,360
She does, like, nothing.

1593
02:40:42,280 --> 02:40:43,440
She's so weak.

1594
02:40:44,760 --> 02:40:46,440
Oh, I forgot I have, like, a bomb.

1595
02:40:46,880 --> 02:40:47,320
A Drifter.

1596
02:40:47,580 --> 02:40:49,120
I've just been, like, 9-9 in.

1597
02:40:50,800 --> 02:40:51,260
Okay.

1598
02:40:52,140 --> 02:40:52,580
No.

1599
02:40:52,880 --> 02:40:53,420
Oh, no.

1600
02:40:53,660 --> 02:40:54,120
Oh, no.

1601
02:40:54,440 --> 02:40:55,900
Oh, no.

1602
02:40:55,900 --> 02:40:56,320
Oh, no.

1603
02:40:56,500 --> 02:40:57,060
No, I said no.

1604
02:40:57,320 --> 02:40:57,940
Okay, it's okay.

1605
02:40:58,420 --> 02:40:58,900
It's okay.

1606
02:40:59,640 --> 02:41:00,940
Oh, no, man.

1607
02:41:03,160 --> 02:41:04,280
Everything is fine.

1608
02:41:04,700 --> 02:41:05,460
There you go.

1609
02:41:07,540 --> 02:41:07,960
Oh, my God.

1610
02:41:08,080 --> 02:41:08,520
What up?

1611
02:41:08,540 --> 02:41:09,380
This is intense.

1612
02:41:09,740 --> 02:41:10,440
This is intense.

1613
02:41:10,780 --> 02:41:12,920
This is actually pretty intense right now.

1614
02:41:14,320 --> 02:41:15,020
Oh, my God.

1615
02:41:15,260 --> 02:41:15,680
Oh, my God.

1616
02:41:15,720 --> 02:41:16,400
Oh, my God.

1617
02:41:16,520 --> 02:41:17,740
I can't stash, man.

1618
02:41:17,840 --> 02:41:18,840
You know that.

1619
02:41:21,860 --> 02:41:22,860
Okay, at least like...

1620
02:41:22,860 --> 02:41:24,600
Her body doesn't have a hitbox.

1621
02:41:24,780 --> 02:41:25,040
That's good.

1622
02:41:25,240 --> 02:41:26,340
Yeah, I killed her!

1623
02:41:27,460 --> 02:41:28,260
Oh, there it is.

1624
02:41:28,380 --> 02:41:29,300
She has brain worms.

1625
02:41:29,660 --> 02:41:31,500
Oh, she has brain worms.

1626
02:41:33,200 --> 02:41:35,020
Holy shit, that was like crazy.

1627
02:41:35,300 --> 02:41:35,740
We have a fight.

1628
02:41:37,020 --> 02:41:38,180
That goes hard.

1629
02:41:38,540 --> 02:41:40,540
I didn't unlock Dash yet, mid.

1630
02:41:40,640 --> 02:41:41,680
That's cheating.

1631
02:41:42,500 --> 02:41:43,240
First try.

1632
02:41:43,660 --> 02:41:44,320
Let's go.

1633
02:41:44,380 --> 02:41:46,220
I love this fight so much.

1634
02:41:46,540 --> 02:41:47,580
Thank you for the super chat.

1635
02:41:47,900 --> 02:41:47,900
Wait.

1636
02:41:48,480 --> 02:41:49,460
Um, Sumi, thank you.

1637
02:41:49,520 --> 02:41:50,000
Thank you.

1638
02:41:50,040 --> 02:41:52,560
Oh, I saw an Akasupa earlier, too.

1639
02:41:52,860 --> 02:41:53,620
Let me say.

1640
02:41:53,740 --> 02:41:55,260
Oh, Shady, thank you, the Akasupa.

1641
02:41:55,460 --> 02:41:55,680
Thank you.

1642
02:41:55,780 --> 02:41:56,360
Thank you.

1643
02:41:56,480 --> 02:41:57,040
Oh, no.

1644
02:41:57,500 --> 02:41:58,980
Ministers, see, too.

1645
02:41:59,600 --> 02:42:00,140
Are you okay?

1646
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:02,840
Not really.

1647
02:42:03,120 --> 02:42:04,580
I feel like I got my ass kicked.

1648
02:42:05,640 --> 02:42:06,900
Why am I on the floor?

1649
02:42:08,700 --> 02:42:10,360
You don't remember what happened?

1650
02:42:11,040 --> 02:42:13,100
You're attacking me, so I have to kick your ass.

1651
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:14,440
What?

1652
02:42:14,940 --> 02:42:16,880
No, I would never let you...

1653
02:42:16,880 --> 02:42:18,820
I would never kick your ass first.

1654
02:42:19,740 --> 02:42:21,340
Remember anything you did a week ago?

1655
02:42:22,860 --> 02:42:30,440
Finally, the last I remember is eating at a restaurant when one of your eight goons in a fair range ran in and scattered bugs everywhere.

1656
02:42:35,640 --> 02:42:41,320
Oh, but this man with a massive head yelling at the dragon for stealing the bugs you're experimenting on.

1657
02:42:41,980 --> 02:42:44,720
I did see a bug fall out of your ear.

1658
02:42:45,780 --> 02:42:46,980
A bug in my ear?

1659
02:42:47,700 --> 02:42:49,340
I think I'm gonna be sick.

1660
02:42:50,400 --> 02:42:52,860
You think it was a mind control bug?

1661
02:42:54,620 --> 02:42:55,800
Oh, I'm sorry.

1662
02:42:56,460 --> 02:43:06,360
You would never got infested with a mind-controlling bug if an egg dragon didn't attack the restaurant with bugs if I hadn't gone back in time and not do stole a Chinese take up.

1663
02:43:06,720 --> 02:43:09,440
I wonder who could have sold a Chinese take up.

1664
02:43:09,660 --> 02:43:13,240
Sorry, it's like written over here with invisible ink that only I could read.

1665
02:43:13,380 --> 02:43:14,020
I'm sorry, guys.

1666
02:43:14,320 --> 02:43:16,900
Like, it's like, they like dokey proof the game.

1667
02:43:16,980 --> 02:43:19,400
So I really don't know who would do such a thing, guys.

1668
02:43:20,400 --> 02:43:21,600
Oh, it's all right.

1669
02:43:22,180 --> 02:43:25,060
Wait, you went back in time?

1670
02:43:26,660 --> 02:43:53,160
uh yeah i was breaking into some rich guy safe so i could sell his stuff to the black market turns out it was time traveling device and i accidentally went back in time how far back did you travel only a week i thought it'd be funny to put some pranks when i came back all the pranks i've done have had some sort of horrible domino effect but this is unrelated to what happened to I did different pranks,

1671
02:43:53,560 --> 02:43:53,560
Mint.

1672
02:43:54,040 --> 02:43:54,580
For sure.

1673
02:43:55,580 --> 02:43:58,320
Or some kind of chain reaction.

1674
02:43:58,720 --> 02:44:02,760
But, um, yeah, a chain reaction.

1675
02:44:05,280 --> 02:44:07,780
Do you still have the device?

1676
02:44:08,600 --> 02:44:10,620
I do, but I think it's broken.

1677
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:12,740
Theme drop.

1678
02:44:13,400 --> 02:44:15,900
You need to find something really smart to fix it.

1679
02:44:16,740 --> 02:44:17,300
You're right.

1680
02:44:17,820 --> 02:44:18,880
But, hmm.

1681
02:44:19,180 --> 02:44:19,800
Maple E.

1682
02:44:20,040 --> 02:44:20,980

1683
02:44:21,120 --> 02:44:21,760

1685
02:44:24,320 --> 02:44:25,260
Michael Lee.

1686
02:44:28,500 --> 02:44:30,300
Lily's boyfriend?

1687
02:44:31,320 --> 02:44:33,080
The Michael Reeves?

1688
02:44:33,620 --> 02:44:35,360
The flesh tuber?

1689
02:44:38,260 --> 02:44:42,500
Is that where he's doing what he's doing instead of uploading on YouTube?

1690
02:44:46,300 --> 02:44:49,040
Sorry, Lily's abused boyfriend.

1691
02:44:51,520 --> 02:44:53,420

1696

Alright.

1697
02:46:02,300 --> 02:46:03,040
Hello, Duby.

1698
02:46:03,240 --> 02:46:04,900

02:46:06,260 --> 02:46:06,680
Alright.

02:46:07,220 --> 02:46:08,060
I'll grab.

1701
02:46:09,460 --> 02:46:10,920
I don't feel like I need health.

1702
02:46:11,080 --> 02:46:13,820
Maybe, like, faster bomb charge.

1703
02:46:14,400 --> 02:46:15,000
For sure.

1704
02:46:15,200 --> 02:46:16,980
And then flat bomb radius.

1705
02:46:19,840 --> 02:46:20,960
Alright, here you go.

1706
02:46:21,760 --> 02:46:22,300
What the?

1707
02:46:22,400 --> 02:46:23,180
Oh, shit.

1708
02:46:23,320 --> 02:46:23,420
It's...

1709
02:46:23,440 --> 02:46:59,840

1710
02:47:00,880 --> 02:47:04,020
Why would you drink milk you found next to a nuclear waste plant?

1711
02:47:04,540 --> 02:47:08,740
I don't know, Doki, why did you stuff us in a locker and never came back?

1712
02:47:09,660 --> 02:47:12,620
Now, close to your house as a nuclear waste plant?

1713
02:47:13,220 --> 02:47:15,400
The milk may have been radioactive.

1714
02:47:16,140 --> 02:47:18,200
Wait, where's Mei Mei?

1715
02:47:19,240 --> 02:47:22,060
Ah, she grew wings and flew away.

1716
02:47:23,440 --> 02:47:25,400
Buffet become uncontrollable.

1717
02:47:25,720 --> 02:47:27,000
Blood-firsty creatures.

1718
02:47:27,480 --> 02:47:29,700
So I'm going to eat you now.

1719
02:47:30,760 --> 02:47:31,280
Oh my god.

1720
02:47:31,500 --> 02:47:33,740
Why are there so many of you?

1721
02:47:38,160 --> 02:47:38,960
Oh wait.

1722
02:47:39,020 --> 02:47:39,840
Is this Metrovania?

1723
02:47:41,660 --> 02:47:43,800
It sounds like Metrovania.

1724
02:47:46,660 --> 02:47:48,500
My copyright free.

1725
02:47:48,960 --> 02:47:49,360
Metrovania.

1726
02:47:50,480 --> 02:47:51,920
We're gonna have a bad time.

1727
02:47:53,020 --> 02:47:53,420
Why does it

1728
02:47:59,220 --> 02:48:00,200
Oh shit!

1729
02:48:04,540 --> 02:48:06,600
Oh megalovania, sorry, megalovania.

1730
02:48:07,100 --> 02:48:08,620
Oh my god, it's...

1731
02:48:08,620 --> 02:48:10,120
It's Mei Mei and Bao Bao!

1732
02:48:10,660 --> 02:48:11,980
Yeah, sorry, megalovania.

1733
02:48:15,480 --> 02:48:16,540
Holy shit.

1734
02:48:17,880 --> 02:48:19,580
Oh my god, please!

1735
02:48:21,120 --> 02:48:22,180
I'm sorry!

1736
02:48:22,500 --> 02:48:23,260
I'll come back!

1737
02:48:23,440 --> 02:48:24,180
Bring you back!

1738
02:48:24,440 --> 02:48:25,320
I'm so sorry!

1739
02:48:29,520 --> 02:48:30,940
It's like the...

1740
02:48:30,940 --> 02:48:34,160
It's like Jesse from Toy Story 2.

1741
02:48:34,560 --> 02:48:35,700
Like, I'm so sorry!

1742
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:40,040
I'll play with you again!

1743
02:48:42,660 --> 02:48:44,780
This is my Megalovania.

1744
02:48:45,540 --> 02:48:46,840
Oh shit, I forgot my R99.

1745
02:48:47,920 --> 02:48:49,040
Well, well, well.

1746
02:48:49,140 --> 02:48:51,100
Wait, Nimi, what the fuck happened to you?

1747
02:48:52,420 --> 02:48:54,860
If it isn't, a dokey braid.

1748
02:48:56,160 --> 02:48:56,720
Nimi!

1749
02:48:57,800 --> 02:48:59,540
You look different!

1750
02:49:00,480 --> 02:49:01,460
She looks goffy.

1751
02:49:02,360 --> 02:49:07,800
I've changed, Doki Bird, after someone snuck purple hair dye into my shampoo.

1752
02:49:09,600 --> 02:49:11,060
Who could do such a thing?

1753
02:49:12,920 --> 02:49:14,320
Oh my god, Nimi!

1754
02:49:14,500 --> 02:49:15,360
I didn't even notice.

1755
02:49:15,500 --> 02:49:17,160
I love the new hair color.

1756
02:49:17,280 --> 02:49:18,860
Purple looks so good on you.

1757
02:49:19,700 --> 02:49:20,960
Why is she herpa?

1758
02:49:22,020 --> 02:49:25,360
I've embraced an emo lifestyle, Doki.

1759
02:49:25,760 --> 02:49:28,600
And my name isn't Neemie Nightmare anymore.

1760
02:49:29,540 --> 02:49:33,360
It's Nightmare, Nightmare, like Nightmare Moon.

1761
02:49:34,280 --> 02:49:36,340
I'm a deaf metal now.

1762
02:49:36,760 --> 02:49:38,660
You could say I'm an artist.

1763
02:49:40,360 --> 02:49:43,440
I severely damaged my vocal cords trying to vocal fry.

1764
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:45,980
But I like the pain.

1765
02:49:46,660 --> 02:49:50,940
I take hot showers every day to practice burning in hell.

1766
02:49:51,960 --> 02:49:53,560
Why didn't you draw your hair back?

1767
02:49:55,760 --> 02:51:21,240

1769
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:30,160
Okay, we'll get more health.

1770
02:51:30,640 --> 02:51:31,620
I feel like...

1771
02:51:31,620 --> 02:51:34,020
Okay, we'll try the shotgun and see how it goes.

1772
02:51:34,200 --> 02:51:36,080
Okay, let's get this here.

1773
02:51:37,800 --> 02:51:38,060
Alright.

1774
02:51:38,940 --> 02:51:39,580
There you go.

1775
02:51:39,920 --> 02:51:41,180
Dad, I want to try the shotgun.

1776
02:51:44,680 --> 02:51:45,600
There's Lily.

1777
02:51:45,880 --> 02:51:47,080
There's Lily P2.

1778
02:51:47,960 --> 02:51:48,160
Oh.

1779
02:51:48,580 --> 02:51:51,080
Oh, is that toky bird I see?

1780
02:51:52,500 --> 02:51:53,440
Yeah, you're...

1781
02:51:53,440 --> 02:51:54,040
Oh, my God.

1782
02:51:55,760 --> 02:51:57,320
I don't know why I said that.

1783
02:51:58,880 --> 02:52:01,380
How'd you get so buff, Lily?

1784
02:52:02,160 --> 02:52:05,140
Oh, well, it all started a week ago.

1785
02:52:05,660 --> 02:52:08,890
But I found the fortune cookie on the sidewalk while walking 10 feet.

1786
02:52:10,220 --> 02:52:10,780
Oh, shit.

1787
02:52:11,040 --> 02:52:16,100
I think I dropped one while running away with my not-soil and Chinese food that I legally paid for.

1788
02:52:17,980 --> 02:52:20,820
Is that dad up there?

1789
02:52:21,700 --> 02:52:24,320
Wait, you ate a fortune cookie you found on the floor?

1790
02:52:25,780 --> 02:52:52,940
that's nasty I just opened a cookie to read my fortune my fortune red you're so frown and weak that even a bug squish you we are I was offended honestly but mostly hurt and so I train obsessively every day from dawn till dusk I box with a boxing robot my boyfriend made then at the end of every night I beat my boy

1791
02:52:57,500 --> 02:53:00,940
wait can someone screenshot this I would have send this to Lily.

1792
02:53:02,600 --> 02:53:07,940
Someone screenshot this and I want to send this to Lily.

1793
02:53:08,400 --> 02:53:09,080
Wait, actually, no.

1794
02:53:09,260 --> 02:53:10,080
No, you don't need a screenshot.

1795
02:53:10,260 --> 02:53:14,100
I'll pause it in the pod after the stream ends and I'm sending over to her.

1796
02:53:17,200 --> 02:53:18,700
You guys don't need a screenshot.

1797
02:53:19,620 --> 02:53:24,560
I'll pause it in this pod and I'll screenshot it myself and then send it to her.

1798
02:53:25,020 --> 02:53:28,100
I need to get stronger, clicker.

1799
02:53:28,440 --> 02:54:03,060
I started taking steroids wow it took so many steroids oh god i love the writing this is crazy the local pharmacist wouldn't give me steroids anymore i broke it to people's homes and looked through their medicine cabinets looking for more did you find some i found a bottle labeled steroids the pills look completely different but i just assumed they were a different brand my mood started to change looked more into it and turns out these weren't steroids.

1800
02:54:03,540 --> 02:54:04,860
They were angry pills.

1801
02:54:05,160 --> 02:54:05,900
Alright, give me a sec.

1802
02:54:07,420 --> 02:54:08,360
Give me a sec.

1803
02:54:09,120 --> 02:54:11,340
Dad is being a brat right now.

1804
02:54:11,940 --> 02:54:12,500
Dad.

1805
02:54:13,520 --> 02:54:14,540
That's right.

1806
02:54:20,470 --> 02:54:21,370
He's fine.

1807
02:54:21,670 --> 02:54:22,750
He's fine.

1808
02:54:25,210 --> 02:54:27,170
What makes the pills angry?

1809
02:54:27,750 --> 02:54:30,170
He got into the angry pills too.

1810
02:54:30,930 --> 02:54:33,190
I've been sent into a fit of rage, Doki.

1811
02:54:33,690 --> 02:54:37,730
Now I have to beat you up, just like my boyfriend.

1812
02:54:39,170 --> 02:54:41,370
You don't seem angry.

1813
02:54:41,970 --> 02:54:44,650
No, I'm just good at hiding my emotions.

1814
02:54:44,970 --> 02:54:48,390
But that's really incensed that you'd assume that I'm not angry just because you can't see it.

1815
02:54:48,630 --> 02:54:49,810
You've really done it now.

1816
02:54:50,190 --> 02:54:52,230
I'm going to skin you alive.

1817
02:54:53,210 --> 02:54:55,830
Lily peach you more like Lily Macho.

1818
02:54:56,270 --> 02:54:58,330
Look at thank you for the super chat.

1819
02:54:58,990 --> 02:54:59,650
Thank you.

1820
02:54:59,770 --> 02:55:00,370
Thank you.

1821
02:55:01,330 --> 02:55:02,310
Oh my God.

1822
02:55:02,570 --> 02:55:03,350
Oh my God.

1823
02:55:03,690 --> 02:55:05,850
The chocolate rain?

1824
02:55:08,790 --> 02:55:09,470
Okay.

1825
02:55:11,650 --> 02:55:12,930
Oh wait, here.

1826
02:55:13,630 --> 02:55:14,150
Thank God.

1827
02:55:15,250 --> 02:55:15,950
Oh, thank God.

1828
02:55:18,090 --> 02:55:18,090
Okay.

1829
02:55:18,630 --> 02:55:19,390
Oh, okay, wait, wait.

1830
02:55:19,670 --> 02:55:20,850
I want to try the shotgun actually.

1831
02:55:21,530 --> 02:55:21,750
Boom.

1832
02:55:24,150 --> 02:55:25,690
Honestly, I think...

1833
02:55:26,350 --> 02:55:28,170
I think the...

1834
02:55:28,170 --> 02:55:31,710
Yeah, the Doki 99 is the strongest so far.

1835
02:55:33,690 --> 02:55:37,030
Yeah, I like the Doki 99 the most out of all of it.

1836
02:55:37,930 --> 02:55:39,150
It's the strongest gun.

1837
02:55:39,630 --> 02:55:41,210
It's just go brrrr.

1838
02:55:43,650 --> 02:55:43,950
Eat.

1839
02:55:47,030 --> 02:55:48,590
I like, I love the writing.

1840
02:55:48,770 --> 02:55:50,590
The writing, props to the writer.

1841
02:55:50,950 --> 02:55:53,850
The writer, the writer knows this shit.

1842
02:55:56,090 --> 02:55:58,750
All right, it's the ghost of future, I guess.

1843
02:55:59,190 --> 02:56:00,670
The Christmas ghost of future.

1844
02:56:01,810 --> 02:56:03,670
Doki, have you been streaming regular?

1845
02:56:03,690 --> 02:56:35,110
regularly oh my god it's my manager it's so good is it after being tortured by your dragons what what did they do to you one of your dragons that stumbled upon a staff of the arcane it became used it became using his newfound powers for evil abusing his powers your dragons put chains around my wrists and ankles and locked me in the dungeon for years when you've been locked in dungeon for less than a week?

1846
02:56:35,950 --> 02:56:40,430
Let me continue with the story and I'm lying for dramatic effect.

1847
02:56:41,650 --> 02:56:45,650
The dragon will stop by my cell regularly to give me wedgies.

1848
02:56:46,030 --> 02:56:47,430
I was beyond mortified.

1849
02:56:48,210 --> 02:57:01,490
I noticed a twig in the corner of my dusty cell and out of desperation started training quietly behind bars, hoping that one day I could use the twig to cast a spell.

1850
02:57:04,190 --> 02:57:08,270
I'm here for justice after what your dragoons have done, Tommy.

1851
02:57:10,370 --> 02:57:12,050
Mr. Man, I can explain.

1852
02:57:13,270 --> 02:57:13,790
Oh, no.

1853
02:57:14,190 --> 02:57:14,970
No, please.

1854
02:57:15,950 --> 02:57:18,530
Please, I don't want to do my task list for today.

1855
02:57:18,930 --> 02:57:19,470
I...

1856
02:57:20,730 --> 02:57:22,930
Please let me ghost you.

1857
02:57:26,570 --> 02:57:30,630
I just wanted this associate for one more hour.

1858
02:57:31,090 --> 02:57:31,950
Mr. Manager.

1859
02:57:32,670 --> 02:57:32,910
Wait.

1860
02:57:37,610 --> 02:57:43,730
Please let me play Dynasty Warriors one more time on stream.

1861
02:57:43,910 --> 02:57:49,150
Let me kill my channel one more day.

1862
02:57:50,390 --> 02:57:53,030
War manager, repent.

1863
02:57:54,490 --> 02:57:57,270
Have you repented for your sins yet guys?

1864
02:57:58,050 --> 02:57:58,630
What's this?

1865
02:57:59,330 --> 02:57:59,930
Ow shit.

1866
02:58:01,350 --> 02:58:01,970
I heard.

1867
02:58:05,840 --> 02:58:06,520
It's okay.

1868
02:58:06,560 --> 02:58:07,640
I'm not actually killing them.

1869
02:58:07,760 --> 02:58:09,040
They're just respawning, guys.

1870
02:58:15,040 --> 02:58:16,740
Oh, chocolate brain.

1871
02:58:19,860 --> 02:58:22,680
Man, if only all SMGs do not require.

1872
02:58:22,920 --> 02:58:26,040
Okay, I... I just... Please, dad, please.

1873
02:58:27,540 --> 02:58:28,420
Stick for it.

1874
02:58:28,560 --> 02:58:29,120
Oh my god.

1875
02:58:29,340 --> 02:58:31,120
Liz, I don't need bombs!

1876
02:58:32,000 --> 02:58:32,560
I'm 1 HP!

1877
02:58:32,960 --> 02:58:34,000
I'm 1... No!

1878
02:58:34,680 --> 02:58:35,280
Wait, do I live?

1879
02:58:35,440 --> 02:58:36,360
Oh my god, I live.

1880
02:58:36,500 --> 02:58:36,660
Okay.

1881
02:58:37,000 --> 02:58:37,560
Oh, thank you.

1882
02:58:37,660 --> 02:58:37,960
Thank you.

1883
02:58:38,020 --> 02:58:38,560
This is, yeah.

1884
02:58:38,720 --> 02:58:39,000
Thank you.

1885
02:58:39,080 --> 02:58:39,900
Thank you for the HP.

1886
02:58:40,260 --> 02:58:41,800
Thank you for the HP.

1887
02:58:42,560 --> 02:58:42,760
Okay.

1888
02:58:43,060 --> 02:58:44,040
Oh, two eight.

1889
02:58:44,220 --> 02:58:44,420
Yes.

1890
02:58:44,620 --> 02:58:44,900
Okay.

1891
02:58:45,020 --> 02:58:45,720
Good timing.

1892
02:58:46,060 --> 02:58:46,800
Good timing.

1893
02:58:47,620 --> 02:58:48,540
Very good timing.

1894
02:58:50,500 --> 02:58:52,300
I really appreciate that.

1895
02:58:52,760 --> 02:58:53,680
Okay, I maxed out.

1896
02:58:53,940 --> 02:58:55,360
I don't think I'm gonna use shotgun.

1897
02:58:55,680 --> 02:59:01,560
I feel like the shotgun is, uh, okay, I guess I have enough money for the shotgun.

1898
02:59:05,440 --> 02:59:30,880
typical dad behavior the inventor's party should be nearby hey do you know where the inventor's party is who's this guy where is it you're talking tom my oh she Thomas Edison how are you alive I resurrected myself you resurrected oh my god it's my oh she Thomas Edison

1899
02:59:35,440 --> 03:00:06,480
resurrected yourself while dead all right well technically no i just want to take credit for this fabulous new resurrection technology that's my own sheep right there everyone who existed between 1800 and 1888 is once again alive how exciting the only part i'm excited about is having to coexist with that tesla that scummy tesla nonetheless i've already accomplished a great deal after returning the land of the living.

1900
03:00:06,900 --> 03:00:14,000
I am into ways that make humans, animals, and everyone in between considerably more irritable and susceptible to violence.

1901
03:00:14,820 --> 03:00:16,800
No wonder everyone has been attacking me.

1902
03:00:17,140 --> 03:00:18,500
Classic, Thomas.

1903
03:00:19,340 --> 03:00:21,260
Who resurrected you anyway?

1904
03:00:21,720 --> 03:00:27,700
After I rose gracefully from my slumber, this annoyingly cheerful scientist was celebrating that I had awoken.

1905
03:00:28,240 --> 03:00:41,440
He kept rambling about how his doctor prescribed him angry pills due to the self-fulfilling nature of how naturally joyful jolly he is, but how recently a side effect of his medication were big muscles and an even bigger brain.

1906
03:00:43,440 --> 03:00:46,680
That scientist must have taken the steroids that someone else swapped.

1907
03:00:47,940 --> 03:00:51,200
And you're some sort of yellow humanoid avian?

1908
03:00:51,760 --> 03:00:52,560
What are you?

1909
03:00:52,640 --> 03:00:58,260
Some kind of... No, I'm Dokeybird, and it's just a skin suit.

1910
03:00:58,880 --> 03:01:02,300
Now that I think about it, that name sounds familiar.

1911
03:01:07,360 --> 03:01:41,180
Oh, have you heard of me did he receive all the fan mail i wrote to him of my oshi yes and it's quite unfortunate what i have said i'll send a clip of you talking about me you were shipping me with that's not true it was called doomed yowie it's not technically it's not really a ship it's like a passion to be frank that clip ruined my life the mere idea of me being with that creature Quite literally gave my father a heart attack.

1912
03:01:46,620 --> 03:01:47,880
Of course not.

1913
03:01:48,340 --> 03:01:52,960
He was simply startled because I'm lovingly engaged to Henry.

1914
03:01:53,340 --> 03:01:55,680
To be fair, I'm like, it's the 1800s.

1915
03:01:56,060 --> 03:01:57,700
Like, it's a time.

1916
03:01:58,140 --> 03:02:00,380
It's a period where, you know.

1917
03:02:05,090 --> 03:02:08,210
To the riot to the start.

1918
03:02:08,210 --> 03:02:11,450
I mean, like, it was the 1800s.

1919
03:02:11,470 --> 03:02:13,350
I would assume he was.

1920
03:02:13,350 --> 03:02:13,970
like

1921
03:02:17,130 --> 03:02:44,350
something about mutated rabbits an extremely muscular pink hair lady emo nurse and vengeful warlock my father had to be transferred from our hospital in New Jersey to a hospital in New York I stayed in New York to take care of my father and none other than Nikola Tesla was living that area no matter my frivolous attempts at avoiding him I encountered him in coffee shops on daily walks at the hairdresser,

1922
03:02:44,750 --> 03:02:51,910
eating tacos at the zoo because I needed to purchase an elephant for one of my experiments in toilet sauce.

1923
03:02:52,370 --> 03:02:55,310
Teltzla came to believe that I was stalking him out of love.

1924
03:02:55,570 --> 03:02:58,950
The delusional man eventually confessed his love for me.

1925
03:02:59,990 --> 03:03:02,430
Nikola Tesla is in love with you?

1926
03:03:02,930 --> 03:03:03,870
Of course he is.

1927
03:03:04,210 --> 03:03:05,370
Oh, that's true.

1928
03:03:05,710 --> 03:03:08,070
Who isn't in love with Thomas Edison?

1929
03:03:08,570 --> 03:03:10,610
But I can't stand that right.

1930
03:03:11,110 --> 03:03:13,330
I feel like I'm in a different game now.

1931
03:03:13,350 --> 03:03:16,810
I don't think I'm in the same game anymore.

1932
03:03:17,390 --> 03:03:20,030
I think like we had a genre swap.

1933
03:03:22,030 --> 03:03:26,630
I'm sorry that Tesla is bothering you, but I need your help.

1934
03:03:26,970 --> 03:03:29,550
I need a fix this time machine.

1935
03:03:30,010 --> 03:03:33,730
Oh, please, I can only blame you, Toki bird.

1936
03:03:34,190 --> 03:03:36,710
They made this in two weeks.

1937
03:03:37,230 --> 03:03:43,110
For this, I feel like this game does not feel, I feel like they spent so much.

1938
03:03:43,350 --> 03:03:46,890
Did you guys sleep while making this game?

1939
03:03:47,310 --> 03:03:51,490
Like, for this terrible inconvenience.

1940
03:03:55,990 --> 03:03:57,170
Oh, shit.

1941
03:03:57,970 --> 03:03:58,430
Oh, shit.

1942
03:03:59,910 --> 03:04:01,630
Oh, my God.

1943
03:04:02,430 --> 03:04:04,970
I'm actually just playing soap song now.

1944
03:04:08,730 --> 03:04:09,930
Holy shit.

1945
03:04:10,630 --> 03:04:11,130

03:08:23,700 --> 03:08:26,160
It's motherfucking Nikola Tesla.

1985
03:08:29,440 --> 03:08:32,400
I did not expect.

1986
03:08:32,560 --> 03:09:10,000

Let's see.

1996
03:11:15,180 --> 03:11:17,200

2003
03:13:51,090 --> 03:15:05,050
one bullet dokey bird so w-a-sd right click aim mode left click fire tab switch between dokey and mint left click push objects reset level walk mouse wheel up is sensitivity um you might have noticed this complicated sounding option one of the uh but you're the thing that ties nudge and n can result in wildly unpredictable changes after four or five bounces we wound up implementing two systems to help to play with this reactive mode automatically lower the sensitivity the number of bounces in the predicted path allows you to adjust the sensitivity of leisure with your mouse wheel if okay we'll do reactive mode first all right so the team is frail with the sprites uh geobah with the programming music sound effects next to you in level design and story orca zone with illustration and ui design and rice with programming sprites and level design all the sprites are so cute guys oh my god you guys can recognize like um a couple of your fellow dragons here in the team uh all the um some of

2005
03:15:34,990 --> 03:15:44,030
i'm guys i'm i'm playing my game i'm that was that wow oh my god I'm doing it, guys.

03:15:50,780 --> 03:15:51,080
All right.

2008
03:15:51,180 --> 03:15:54,060
Maybe in the next theme, I'll be like, dokey mode.

2009
03:15:55,120 --> 03:15:57,760
Every game has to have a dokey patch.

2010
03:15:58,140 --> 03:15:59,260
A dokey mode.

2011
03:16:01,280 --> 03:16:01,700
All right.

2012
03:16:02,060 --> 03:16:03,060

03:16:06,400 --> 03:16:07,200
All right.

2014
03:16:08,600 --> 03:16:12,510
All right.

2015
03:16:12,510 --> 03:16:13,130
All right.

2016
03:16:14,110 --> 03:16:15,170

You can take my dragoons.

I need them for my projects.

2023
03:16:57,180 --> 03:17:00,220
Whoever you are, you made a mistake.

2024
03:17:01,080 --> 03:17:01,420

2028
03:17:12,720 --> 03:17:13,680
Oh my other crookie!

2029
03:17:13,960 --> 03:17:15,060
Oh, look at my crosshair.

2030
03:17:15,100 --> 03:17:15,700
It's a bullet.

2031
03:17:16,920 --> 03:17:18,920
You have trackers on your dragoons?

2032
03:17:19,460 --> 03:17:21,300
Don't worry about it.

2033
03:17:21,760 --> 03:17:24,380
I'm going to take a closer look at those guards.

2034
03:17:25,960 --> 03:17:29,140
It looks like they're robots in...

2035
03:17:29,140 --> 03:17:30,800
Robots in disguise.

2036
03:17:32,740 --> 03:17:33,740
What kind of robots?

2037
03:17:34,400 --> 03:17:36,680
They look kind of like dragoons.

2038
03:17:37,620 --> 03:17:37,800
Aw.

2039
03:17:38,420 --> 03:17:39,600
Oh, I'm sorry.

2040
03:17:39,720 --> 03:17:41,960
Were you hoping for sexy robot women?

2041
03:17:42,380 --> 03:17:45,460
Um, I'm hoping for sexy robot women.

2042
03:17:47,080 --> 03:17:47,820
No.

2043
03:17:52,400 --> 03:18:22,550
yes anyway damn there's a lot of them good thing I brought uh-oh I don't like that uh-oh I forgot my extra ammo I'm gonna have to make every shot count what's that phrase one shot like oh man what's that what's that phrase don't hear don't worry I got this I'm a gamer watch and learn.

2044
03:18:24,270 --> 03:18:25,310
Alright, W-A-S-D.

2045
03:18:25,590 --> 03:18:26,370
Oh, I can move.

2046
03:18:28,050 --> 03:18:29,910
One shot, one kill.

2047
03:18:31,510 --> 03:18:31,990
Oh, okay.

2048
03:18:34,230 --> 03:18:34,770
Pew pew.

2049
03:18:37,150 --> 03:18:39,130
Just like the real Doki.

2050
03:18:39,910 --> 03:18:42,190
Easy, as long as I don't get too close.

2051
03:18:42,510 --> 03:18:44,310
I can take him out with one shot.

2052
03:18:45,070 --> 03:18:47,950
Remember, Doki, this is a sneaking mission.

2053
03:18:48,730 --> 03:18:49,130
What?

2054
03:18:49,690 --> 03:18:50,750
Never mind.

2055
03:18:51,930 --> 03:18:55,090
Who needs to sneak when I can kill all witnesses?

2056
03:18:56,250 --> 03:18:58,630
These are all the bossy Xboxes in the way.

2057
03:18:59,430 --> 03:19:01,170
Maybe you can try hiding in one of them.

2058
03:19:02,010 --> 03:19:03,210
Why would I do that?

2059
03:19:04,230 --> 03:19:05,150
Stealth be exactly...

2060
03:19:05,150 --> 03:19:06,370
Stealth is optional.

2061
03:19:07,990 --> 03:19:09,030
Forget it.

2062
03:19:09,710 --> 03:19:10,750
Wait, I have an idea.

2063
03:19:11,470 --> 03:19:12,210
Give me a sec.

2064
03:19:13,250 --> 03:19:16,870
Look, if I turn invisible, the guards can't see me.

2065
03:19:17,590 --> 03:19:19,850
I'll move things around to help you line up your shots.

2066
03:19:21,310 --> 03:19:32,970
shot can do before they notice and go on alert so be ready okay how do i okay how much can i move

2067
03:19:36,060 --> 03:19:39,020
bing bing bong

2068
03:19:42,040 --> 03:19:56,800
oh Patrick here easy bing sing what's that helpful for me We make a pretty good team, don't we?

2069
03:19:57,520 --> 03:19:58,760
You push some boxes.

2070
03:19:58,980 --> 03:20:00,160
Yeah, I could do that, too.

2071
03:20:00,780 --> 03:20:03,560
A minute, you could have made that shot without me.

2072
03:20:04,940 --> 03:20:05,900
Okay, fine.

2073
03:20:06,440 --> 03:20:08,520
I guess maybe we do.

2074
03:20:10,040 --> 03:20:12,240
Okay, I would have still, I would have denied it.

2075
03:20:12,260 --> 03:20:13,560
Just a rage baiter.

2076
03:20:15,780 --> 03:20:18,320
Hmm, they aren't lined up like last time.

2077
03:20:18,980 --> 03:20:19,840
It's fine.

2078
03:20:20,000 --> 03:20:21,320
See that metal drum?

2079
03:20:21,660 --> 03:20:23,420
I can bounce my bullet out of it.

2080
03:20:23,540 --> 03:20:25,500
if you move it over a little.

2081
03:20:26,520 --> 03:20:27,940
That doesn't even make sense.

2082
03:20:28,580 --> 03:20:29,060
Oh, yeah?

2083
03:20:29,640 --> 03:20:30,420
Try it.

2084
03:20:30,540 --> 03:20:31,240
You'll see.

2085
03:20:32,220 --> 03:20:32,560
Alright.

2086
03:20:32,780 --> 03:20:32,920
Wait.

2087
03:20:33,920 --> 03:20:33,920
Oh.

2088
03:20:35,700 --> 03:20:36,080
Wait.

2089
03:20:39,870 --> 03:20:42,310
Okay, I have to...

2090
03:20:42,310 --> 03:20:43,750
I have to move this.

2091
03:20:45,170 --> 03:20:45,630
Bong!

2092
03:20:46,730 --> 03:20:47,250
Bong!

2093
03:20:51,590 --> 03:20:52,770
Oh, there you go.

2094
03:20:53,370 --> 03:20:53,770
Yay!

2095
03:20:54,630 --> 03:20:55,390
Yay!

2096
03:20:56,890 --> 03:20:57,410
See?

2097
03:20:57,910 --> 03:20:58,670
No problem.

2098
03:20:59,130 --> 03:21:01,790
I guess I'm the brains of this team, huh?

2099
03:21:04,690 --> 03:21:05,110
Huh?

2100
03:21:05,330 --> 03:21:06,270
What does that mean?

2101
03:21:07,930 --> 03:21:08,970
Doki bird?

2102
03:21:12,150 --> 03:21:14,430
Wait, that's a real dragon over there.

2103
03:21:14,630 --> 03:21:15,350
What is he doing?

2104
03:21:15,930 --> 03:21:18,190
He shouldn't be working for anyone, but exactly!

2105
03:21:19,110 --> 03:21:19,630
Trader!

2106
03:21:20,290 --> 03:21:21,930
Watch out for those barrels, Doki.

2107
03:21:22,330 --> 03:21:23,730
They look kind of dangerous.

2108
03:21:24,170 --> 03:21:25,210
How dare you?

2109
03:21:30,990 --> 03:21:32,750
That's what you get.

2110
03:21:34,050 --> 03:21:36,110
How dare you walk for any work?

2111
03:21:36,810 --> 03:21:37,250
That's right.

2112
03:21:37,370 --> 03:21:40,470
No mercy for treason.

2113
03:21:41,270 --> 03:21:43,190
No mercy for treason.

2114
03:21:43,930 --> 03:21:45,430
For that poor dragon.

2115
03:21:46,810 --> 03:21:49,250
Isn't your job to make sure they're safe?

2116
03:21:50,150 --> 03:21:52,770
He was working for the other side.

2117
03:21:58,130 --> 03:22:00,670
It was treason.

2118
03:22:01,290 --> 03:22:05,230
How dare you?

2119
03:22:06,270 --> 03:22:09,090
I can't believe he would do such a thing.

2120
03:22:09,470 --> 03:22:11,030
He was a spy.

2121
03:22:14,840 --> 03:22:15,400
There we go.

2122
03:22:15,740 --> 03:22:16,680
Oh wait, never mind.

2123
03:22:18,080 --> 03:22:18,560
I can't believe that.

2124
03:22:18,760 --> 03:22:18,980
Okay.

2125
03:22:20,000 --> 03:22:21,240
Alright, how do we do this?

2126
03:22:24,480 --> 03:22:25,100
Okay.

2127
03:22:26,260 --> 03:22:26,880
Oh!

2128
03:22:28,780 --> 03:22:29,920
There you go.

2129
03:22:30,160 --> 03:22:31,360
That should... right?

2130
03:22:35,830 --> 03:22:36,450
There.

2131
03:22:36,670 --> 03:22:37,830
Oh, whoops.

2132
03:22:42,710 --> 03:22:42,710
Alright.

2133
03:22:43,230 --> 03:22:43,250
There.

2134
03:22:43,410 --> 03:22:44,270
Don't worry, I got this.

2135
03:22:44,790 --> 03:22:46,250
I'll fix this.

2136
03:22:48,910 --> 03:22:50,870
By doing the same thing.

2137
03:22:56,370 --> 03:22:59,330
Okay, don't worry, I got this.

2138
03:23:01,670 --> 03:23:02,650
All right, this time.

2139
03:23:10,320 --> 03:23:10,800
There you go.

2140
03:23:11,900 --> 03:23:13,460
Okay, I didn't see that.

2141
03:23:15,980 --> 03:23:17,040
Don't worry.

2142
03:23:17,700 --> 03:23:22,160
I got this by doing a different thing.

2143
03:23:26,360 --> 03:23:27,420
Oh, shit.

2144
03:23:27,580 --> 03:23:28,600
Okay, don't worry.

2145
03:23:29,120 --> 03:23:31,700
Eventually, something will change.

2146
03:23:32,960 --> 03:23:33,920
Wait, okay.

2147
03:23:40,100 --> 03:23:41,240
Wait, how do I...

2148
03:23:41,240 --> 03:23:43,060
Wait, actually, how do I...

2149
03:23:45,000 --> 03:23:47,740
I'm doing a different save.

2150
03:23:48,060 --> 03:23:51,360
Don't worry, this time, it will be different.

2151
03:23:51,720 --> 03:23:53,060
It will...

2152
03:24:04,140 --> 03:24:05,320
There we go.

2153
03:24:11,760 --> 03:24:12,400
Alright.

2154
03:24:13,420 --> 03:24:15,200
Wait, I figured it out.

2155
03:24:15,840 --> 03:24:16,360
Bing.

2156
03:24:27,170 --> 03:24:28,390
I don't know what...

2157
03:24:31,810 --> 03:24:33,550
Something different will happen.

2158
03:24:33,810 --> 03:24:34,630
I swear to God.

2159
03:24:36,170 --> 03:24:36,730
There we go.

2160
03:24:37,790 --> 03:24:38,250
I did...

2161
03:24:38,250 --> 03:24:38,450
Oh.

2162
03:24:40,670 --> 03:24:41,490
Okay, wait.

2163
03:24:43,070 --> 03:24:44,290
I figured it out.

2164
03:24:49,950 --> 03:24:50,310
Don't worry.

2165
03:24:50,490 --> 03:24:51,210
I figured it out.

2166
03:24:55,160 --> 03:24:56,140
What the fuck?

2167
03:24:56,360 --> 03:24:57,340
It said it hit him.

2168
03:24:59,680 --> 03:25:01,960
okay I figured it out

2169
03:25:08,650 --> 03:25:15,010
as long as I don't accidentally kill him it should be fine it's the little things

2170
03:25:26,050 --> 03:25:28,250
there you go we did it

2171
03:25:31,730 --> 03:25:42,230
I took the I knew you'd come save look see I saved his life he doesn't know the he doesn't know that he died Seven times in this previous live.

2172
03:25:43,770 --> 03:25:45,190
Please, the others are still captured.

2173
03:25:46,750 --> 03:25:47,950
First try.

2174
03:25:48,790 --> 03:25:49,830
He doesn't know.

2175
03:25:50,210 --> 03:25:51,310
He doesn't know.

2176
03:25:51,470 --> 03:25:52,540
Won't hurt him.

2177
03:25:55,050 --> 03:25:55,650
What a coward.

2178
03:25:55,850 --> 03:25:57,130
I have more questions for him.

2179
03:25:59,110 --> 03:26:01,570
You made that so much harder.

2180
03:26:02,030 --> 03:26:03,250
Look, there's another dragon.

2181
03:26:03,910 --> 03:26:04,810
With all those barrows.

2182
03:26:06,230 --> 03:26:09,350
I bet your bullets gonna bounce around like crazy.

2183
03:26:11,310 --> 03:26:12,690
Don't worry, man.

2184
03:26:12,930 --> 03:26:14,290
I got this.

2185
03:26:14,550 --> 03:26:15,410
Don't worry.

2186
03:26:19,900 --> 03:26:20,980
It's okay.

2187
03:26:21,460 --> 03:26:22,100
Rewind.

2188
03:26:24,520 --> 03:26:25,560
It's okay.

2189
03:26:26,080 --> 03:26:27,000
I rewind.

2190
03:26:27,860 --> 03:26:29,080
No one will know.

2191
03:26:29,820 --> 03:26:30,440
He'll...

2192
03:26:32,120 --> 03:26:34,380
It's just his previous life.

2193
03:26:34,560 --> 03:26:35,140
He's fine.

2194
03:26:38,800 --> 03:26:40,720
Okay, that should not hit him.

2195
03:26:47,970 --> 03:27:17,850
see wait what I said it hit him there you go easy thank you for saving us I was getting so tired being pushed up messed up it's okay it's okay I rewind it I had like a I had like a you know like like in that Rick and Morty episode I do a bad thing and then I just press a button and like everyone's still alive I'm just letting my intrusive thoughts win,

2196
03:27:18,070 --> 03:27:19,810
but like no consequences, though.

2197
03:27:22,730 --> 03:27:25,150
Look, it's your fault for getting kidnapped.

2198
03:27:28,510 --> 03:27:32,950
I was getting so tired of being pushed around by these robot goons.

2199
03:27:35,370 --> 03:27:37,470
Yeah, yeah, where can we find other dragoons?

2200
03:27:38,650 --> 03:27:41,050
Most of them were put to work in the factory.

2201
03:27:41,290 --> 03:27:43,990
It's not far, but you need to get through the guards.

2202
03:27:45,310 --> 03:27:46,110
We got this.

2203
03:27:46,130 --> 03:27:48,070
No, you're still alive.

2204
03:27:49,230 --> 03:27:51,070
It's just your previous life versions.

2205
03:27:51,250 --> 03:27:52,510
Maybe you weren't so lucky.

2206
03:27:53,310 --> 03:27:54,070
If you're sure.

2207
03:27:58,290 --> 03:27:59,750
Look, I whiffed my shot, okay?

2208
03:27:59,890 --> 03:28:00,570
It happens.

2209
03:28:03,390 --> 03:28:04,570
Is it really my...

2210
03:28:04,570 --> 03:28:06,830
I just whiffed my shot, guys.

2211
03:28:07,470 --> 03:28:09,670
It happens to everybody.

2212
03:28:13,890 --> 03:28:15,490
Oops, that was actually...

2213
03:28:15,490 --> 03:28:15,810
Okay.

2214
03:28:16,850 --> 03:28:17,450
Okay.

2215
03:28:20,920 --> 03:28:21,500
Yeah.

2216
03:28:22,940 --> 03:28:23,700
Give me a sec.

2217
03:28:25,060 --> 03:28:26,360
Simple geometry time.

2218
03:28:33,270 --> 03:28:35,630
Oh my god, there's so many geometries though.

2219
03:28:38,310 --> 03:28:40,730
It nearly happens to everybody, guys.

2220
03:28:44,750 --> 03:28:48,250
I'm just seeing if I can do this without using the box.

2221
03:28:52,860 --> 03:28:53,260
Okay.

2222
03:29:01,880 --> 03:29:03,020
All right, let's see.

2223
03:29:04,220 --> 03:29:09,360
I mean, it is possible for some of the solutions without having to use the box.

2224
03:29:10,020 --> 03:29:11,520
Okay, we got to use the box.

2225
03:29:12,500 --> 03:29:13,060
Fine.

2226
03:29:19,050 --> 03:29:19,390
Okay.

2227
03:29:25,880 --> 03:29:26,600
And that.

2228
03:29:27,820 --> 03:29:29,220
All right, we got to push you up.

2229
03:29:30,900 --> 03:29:31,160
Ding.

2230
03:29:31,600 --> 03:29:31,980
Ding.

2231
03:29:37,720 --> 03:29:39,680
And that hits that.

2232
03:29:43,450 --> 03:29:44,770
That hits that.

2233
03:29:45,050 --> 03:29:45,510
And what happened?

2234
03:29:46,370 --> 03:29:46,570
Okay.

2235
03:29:48,090 --> 03:29:57,130
That hits that and then that hits that and then how the fuck?

2236
03:30:03,240 --> 03:30:04,120
I don't know that.

2237
03:30:04,780 --> 03:30:05,080
Hmm.

2238
03:30:08,750 --> 03:30:11,170
Oh my god, what the fuck is this solution?

2239
03:30:15,030 --> 03:30:16,290
I'm thinking.

2240
03:30:17,510 --> 03:30:19,930
Oh my gosh, she's done bing-bonging.

2241
03:30:23,610 --> 03:30:25,070
I don't know, actually.

2242
03:30:25,590 --> 03:30:26,090
Okay, wait.

2243
03:30:30,710 --> 03:30:31,490
Do that.

2244
03:30:32,050 --> 03:30:33,850
And then...

2245
03:30:36,760 --> 03:30:37,880
I'm analyzing.

2246
03:30:40,560 --> 03:30:42,540
I'm analyzing right now.

2247
03:30:42,680 --> 03:30:43,560
Maybe like this.

2248
03:30:45,260 --> 03:30:45,820
I...

2249
03:30:45,820 --> 03:30:47,660
How did it not hit you?

2250
03:30:47,860 --> 03:30:48,280
Okay, wait.

2251
03:30:48,280 --> 03:30:49,800
I think that is how you do it.

2252
03:30:50,560 --> 03:30:51,500
Oh, shit.

2253
03:30:52,220 --> 03:30:53,520
Okay, well, let's try it.

2254
03:30:56,920 --> 03:30:57,940
I thought it hit you.

2255
03:30:57,960 --> 03:30:58,620
hit him.

2256
03:31:02,200 --> 03:31:04,060
It looked like it hit him.

2257
03:31:11,720 --> 03:31:12,600
Ah, fuck it.

2258
03:31:12,880 --> 03:31:14,160
I already fucked it up anyway.

2259
03:31:16,420 --> 03:31:16,660
Alright.

2260
03:31:20,040 --> 03:31:20,480
Okay.

2261
03:31:21,120 --> 03:31:21,560
Bing.

2262
03:31:23,480 --> 03:31:24,040
Bong.

2263
03:31:29,750 --> 03:31:30,250
Okay.

2264
03:31:33,880 --> 03:31:36,880
You need to be able to hit this, too.

2265
03:31:37,820 --> 03:31:39,160
Oh my god, this one's difficult.

2266
03:31:39,920 --> 03:31:40,040
Okay.

2267
03:31:41,360 --> 03:31:44,440
This is actually full-on simple geometry.

2268
03:31:47,240 --> 03:31:48,640
Okay, maybe?

2269
03:31:49,780 --> 03:31:50,060
No.

2270
03:31:57,420 --> 03:31:59,500
Oh, that's so close.

2271
03:32:01,860 --> 03:32:02,720
God damn it!

2272
03:32:02,880 --> 03:32:03,340
Bing!

2273
03:32:04,740 --> 03:32:05,000
Bingo!

2274
03:32:05,780 --> 03:32:08,140
I just shot that.

2275
03:32:10,280 --> 03:32:11,180
Bing!

2276
03:32:14,800 --> 03:32:16,000
How the fuck?

2277
03:32:16,520 --> 03:32:17,240
Maybe Bond?

2278
03:32:17,920 --> 03:32:19,240
Because I don't think this hits him.

2279
03:32:23,730 --> 03:32:24,370
Maybe here?

2280
03:32:36,940 --> 03:32:37,780
Maybe that...

2281
03:32:37,780 --> 03:32:38,540
Oh, wait, no.

2282
03:32:41,840 --> 03:32:42,320
Oh, my.

2283
03:32:42,400 --> 03:32:43,440
This is really difficult.

2284
03:32:46,960 --> 03:32:47,840
Oh, my God.

2285
03:32:48,020 --> 03:32:48,280
Please.

2286
03:32:50,860 --> 03:32:52,040
Or do I ping-bong?

2287
03:33:01,220 --> 03:33:01,740
God.

2288
03:33:01,760 --> 03:33:02,880
God damn it.

2289
03:33:04,400 --> 03:33:04,860
No, no, no.

2290
03:33:05,000 --> 03:33:06,100
We don't need a walkthrough.

2291
03:33:07,920 --> 03:33:08,540
Bing.

2292
03:33:09,820 --> 03:33:10,440
Oh,

2293
03:33:14,890 --> 03:33:15,370
it shows.

2294
03:33:15,710 --> 03:33:15,950
Oh, okay.

2295
03:33:19,610 --> 03:33:20,330
Okay, maybe.

2296
03:33:24,320 --> 03:33:24,940
Maybe.

2297
03:33:31,870 --> 03:33:32,290
Maybe.

2298
03:33:37,620 --> 03:33:39,080
Okay, it's just this.

2299
03:33:39,240 --> 03:33:40,200
God damn it.

2300
03:33:43,380 --> 03:33:45,340
Oh, this is so difficult.

2301
03:33:49,140 --> 03:33:51,520
Maybe I'll move this here.

2302
03:33:52,820 --> 03:33:53,380
Alright.

2303
03:33:55,200 --> 03:33:56,380
I should have to think.

2304
03:34:03,640 --> 03:34:04,160
Bing bong.

2305
03:34:14,830 --> 03:34:15,730
Thinking hard.

2306
03:34:17,170 --> 03:34:19,590
Really not meant to do so much thinking.

2307
03:34:27,480 --> 03:34:29,120
Oh my god, that was so close.

2308
03:34:29,500 --> 03:34:30,680
Wait, I think this is it.

2309
03:34:33,730 --> 03:34:34,870
I fucked up.

2310
03:34:36,030 --> 03:34:36,510
Oh my god.

2311
03:34:36,530 --> 03:34:37,650
All right.

2312
03:34:39,770 --> 03:34:39,970
Okay.

2313
03:34:41,850 --> 03:34:42,770
This way?

2314
03:34:44,230 --> 03:34:46,550
And then this way.

2315
03:34:47,390 --> 03:34:48,210
I've had it.

2316
03:34:50,010 --> 03:34:52,050
I just got a simple geometry this.

2317
03:34:53,130 --> 03:34:53,950
And then it's over.

2318
03:34:58,570 --> 03:34:59,750
Holy shit.

2319
03:35:01,310 --> 03:35:01,650
Okay.

2320
03:35:09,480 --> 03:35:09,700
What?

2321
03:35:19,930 --> 03:35:21,210
What the fuck?

2322
03:35:21,490 --> 03:35:21,690
Okay.

2323
03:35:23,510 --> 03:35:25,370
I'm just like, what the fuck?

2324
03:35:34,400 --> 03:35:35,100
I don't know.

2325
03:35:35,620 --> 03:35:36,920
I don't know.

2326
03:35:40,030 --> 03:35:42,750
Why you don't rotate the way I want you to?

2327
03:35:53,840 --> 03:35:55,400
I'll never know.

2328
03:36:01,060 --> 03:36:02,520
What the fuck?

2329
03:36:16,220 --> 03:36:17,720
It's just this one!

2330
03:36:18,900 --> 03:36:19,660
Oh my god.

2331
03:36:27,530 --> 03:36:28,690
Oh my god, it's this.

2332
03:36:29,750 --> 03:36:31,010
Oh my god, it did it.

2333
03:36:31,090 --> 03:36:32,070
Simple geometry.

2334
03:36:33,610 --> 03:36:34,090
BAM!

2335
03:36:34,430 --> 03:36:36,490
Looks like those bullets are more than enough after all.

2336
03:36:36,810 --> 03:36:38,070
Because I'm such a gamer.

2337
03:36:38,790 --> 03:36:39,110
Sick.

2338
03:36:39,410 --> 03:36:41,210
Okay, nobody was counting.

2339
03:36:41,630 --> 03:36:43,550
Man, nobody was counting.

2340
03:36:44,070 --> 03:36:45,890
Well, at least 10 I think.

2341
03:36:46,430 --> 03:36:47,670
I need you so much.

2342
03:36:50,470 --> 03:36:52,010
I see what the Drangu's meant.

2343
03:36:52,190 --> 03:36:53,090
Their armors look thick.

2344
03:36:53,330 --> 03:36:55,530
You might have to hit them a couple of times to break through.

2345
03:36:56,430 --> 03:36:58,170
I need not have bullets for this.

2346
03:36:58,370 --> 03:37:00,110
Guess we have to try hard this.

2347
03:37:01,270 --> 03:37:02,310
Oh my god, okay.

2348
03:37:04,410 --> 03:37:06,570
How many times do I have to hit them?

2349
03:37:09,970 --> 03:37:12,530
Wait, how many times do I have to hit them?

2350
03:37:14,310 --> 03:37:15,050
Oh, no.

2351
03:37:18,950 --> 03:37:22,410
Okay, man, I can't believe I missed that, guys.

2352
03:37:24,990 --> 03:37:25,590
Holy shit,

2353
03:37:28,870 --> 03:37:29,530
that was crazy.

2354
03:37:34,730 --> 03:37:35,090
Okay.

2355
03:37:35,690 --> 03:37:36,290
Wait,

2356
03:37:40,210 --> 03:37:41,730
there's Metal Gear references?

2357
03:37:46,290 --> 03:37:51,130
Guys, I am the wrong person to figure that out.

2358
03:37:54,990 --> 03:37:58,310
I didn't even realize there was Metal Gear.

2359
03:38:01,250 --> 03:38:02,530
I'm just like, what?

2360
03:38:02,910 --> 03:38:05,130
What do you mean there was Metal Gear references?

2361
03:38:10,100 --> 03:38:12,360
I am the wrong V-Tuber.

2362
03:38:13,140 --> 03:38:15,120
Except notice the Metal Gear.

2363
03:38:23,010 --> 03:38:23,470
There we go.

2364
03:38:23,830 --> 03:38:24,010
Yay!

2365
03:38:24,470 --> 03:38:26,090
Okay, this one was a lot easier.

2366
03:38:28,150 --> 03:38:29,530
This place looked kind of haunted.

2367
03:38:32,670 --> 03:38:33,910
Don't say that.

2368
03:38:34,130 --> 03:38:35,470
I don't have any liquid courage.

2369
03:38:35,570 --> 03:38:36,610
Oh, is that Metal Gear?

2370
03:38:36,790 --> 03:38:38,150
Is that a Metal Gear reference?

2371
03:38:38,610 --> 03:38:40,430
To help me out this time.

2372
03:38:41,730 --> 03:38:42,790
Look, I did it!

2373
03:38:43,250 --> 03:38:45,410
I saw the Metal Gear reference!

2374
03:38:47,870 --> 03:38:50,310
Wow, there's a lot of warning signs around here.

2375
03:38:54,180 --> 03:38:57,080
Maybe we can use these guys because they're so dangerous.

2376
03:38:57,560 --> 03:38:57,900
Okay.

2377
03:39:00,080 --> 03:39:01,080
What do I do?

2378
03:39:01,660 --> 03:39:03,220
Wait, what do I do here?

2379
03:39:05,380 --> 03:39:06,440
What the fuck?

2380
03:39:09,200 --> 03:39:09,840
Oh!

2381
03:39:10,680 --> 03:39:11,320
Oh!

2382
03:39:15,300 --> 03:39:17,300
I see

2383
03:39:22,640 --> 03:39:32,100
Fun I don't know I don't know maybe this Yeah

2384
03:39:44,320 --> 03:40:03,260
Oh fucking Oh one guy I got one guy I got one guy You stupid one guy You You You You Not the one guy.

2385
03:40:04,020 --> 03:40:04,240
You.

2386
03:40:08,060 --> 03:40:09,800
I was like, yay!

2387
03:40:10,580 --> 03:40:11,700
And then I got one guy.

2388
03:40:13,360 --> 03:40:14,280
Always one guy.

2389
03:40:14,440 --> 03:40:15,840
I was like, whoa, I did it!

2390
03:40:16,940 --> 03:40:18,500
I don't even know what I did.

2391
03:40:18,640 --> 03:40:19,700
That's the worst part.

2392
03:40:21,660 --> 03:40:23,440
What the fuck did I do?

2393
03:40:28,970 --> 03:40:30,210
Oh, this is the only way.

2394
03:40:32,770 --> 03:40:33,670
Oh my god.

2395
03:40:33,890 --> 03:40:34,970
was not the only way.

2396
03:40:39,930 --> 03:40:40,330
I don't know.

2397
03:40:40,430 --> 03:40:41,710
I'm just pushing random stuff.

2398
03:40:42,410 --> 03:40:43,410
I don't know.

2399
03:40:46,610 --> 03:40:48,030
Oh my god, this is so difficult.

2400
03:40:58,490 --> 03:40:59,010
Oh, look at this.

2401
03:40:59,130 --> 03:41:00,390
I always get one guy.

2402
03:41:05,430 --> 03:41:05,750
You.

2403
03:41:07,430 --> 03:41:07,850
You.

2404
03:41:10,070 --> 03:41:10,490
You.

2405
03:41:11,170 --> 03:41:11,590
You.

2406
03:41:11,690 --> 03:41:15,050
Of course.

2407
03:41:15,890 --> 03:41:16,030
You.

2408
03:41:19,550 --> 03:41:22,500
Okay, we gotta do it so that we kill him.

2409
03:41:27,140 --> 03:41:27,420
There.

2410
03:41:29,440 --> 03:41:31,240
Oh, that doesn't activate him.

2411
03:41:31,340 --> 03:41:32,220
I thought it did.

2412
03:41:34,800 --> 03:41:36,260
He's just a chill guy.

2413
03:41:36,840 --> 03:41:38,440
I refuse to let him chill.

2414
03:41:39,040 --> 03:41:40,180
He must die.

2415
03:41:53,020 --> 03:41:53,900
Oh my god.

2416
03:41:55,660 --> 03:41:59,100
Why would someone make a dokeeper game that requires?

2417
03:41:59,600 --> 03:42:01,500
This is the game for the people.

2418
03:42:04,980 --> 03:42:07,900
They made a game for the people.

2419
03:42:20,900 --> 03:42:21,900
Oh my god.

2420
03:42:22,040 --> 03:42:22,700
I hate him.

2421
03:42:22,820 --> 03:42:23,240
I hate him.

2422
03:42:23,240 --> 03:42:24,400
It's just this one guy.

2423
03:42:25,040 --> 03:42:26,180
It's literally just him.

2424
03:42:27,200 --> 03:42:29,580
He's actually ruining my entire run.

2425
03:42:30,140 --> 03:42:31,280
This little fucker.

2426
03:42:40,970 --> 03:42:42,070
It's him!

2427
03:42:57,740 --> 03:43:01,420
Oh my god, I don't know what to do I don't know what to do

2428
03:43:08,940 --> 03:43:14,780
Maybe like this I won't kill him No, I can't kill him Oh, I have more beings

2429
03:43:19,600 --> 03:43:21,880
Okay, I don't know I think I messed that up

2430
03:43:33,800 --> 03:43:39,280
Yeah, I already messed that up You You!

2431
03:43:42,120 --> 03:43:44,700
I don't know, maybe here?

2432
03:43:50,930 --> 03:43:53,790
I don't know, I don't know what I'm doing.

2433
03:44:09,450 --> 03:44:10,730
Wait, unless...

2434
03:44:10,730 --> 03:44:13,950
Oh my god, it needs to kill him.

2435
03:44:15,190 --> 03:44:16,890
Like, that's the worst part.

2436
03:44:20,130 --> 03:44:23,470
Please, it needs to kill him and also everything else.

2437
03:44:29,470 --> 03:44:30,790
Oh my god, please.

2438
03:44:30,910 --> 03:44:33,370
I need you to kill him and everything else.

2439
03:44:37,570 --> 03:44:38,330
This is it.

2440
03:44:39,890 --> 03:44:40,230
Yes!

2441
03:44:40,450 --> 03:44:41,610
Yes, I did it!

2442
03:44:41,750 --> 03:44:42,350
Fuck you!

2443
03:44:42,810 --> 03:44:44,430
I'm getting one guy no more.

2444
03:44:45,650 --> 03:44:46,550
Too easy.

2445
03:44:49,350 --> 03:44:50,030
Oh, wait.

2446
03:44:50,190 --> 03:44:51,350
Where are those two doing back here?

2447
03:44:51,650 --> 03:44:52,930
Focus on the mission, Doki.

2448
03:44:53,330 --> 03:44:54,130
You can think about Drake.

2449
03:44:54,370 --> 03:44:54,650
Okay.

2450
03:44:57,190 --> 03:44:58,230
All right.

2451
03:44:58,370 --> 03:45:00,010
How do we save him?

2452
03:45:00,070 --> 03:45:00,910
Oh.

2453
03:45:11,530 --> 03:45:12,370
Okay.

2454
03:45:12,850 --> 03:45:13,670
How do we...

2455
03:45:13,670 --> 03:45:14,970
How do we...

2456
03:45:14,970 --> 03:45:16,110
How do we...

2457
03:45:18,650 --> 03:45:20,430
It was an accident.

2458
03:45:21,070 --> 03:45:21,530
I swear.

2459
03:45:22,170 --> 03:45:24,150
I swear to God.

2460
03:45:24,670 --> 03:45:26,010
That was an accident.

2461
03:45:26,550 --> 03:45:27,190
I pushed this.

2462
03:45:27,290 --> 03:45:28,410
I swear to God.

2463
03:45:29,350 --> 03:45:30,250
I swear.

2464
03:45:31,210 --> 03:45:34,250
Oh yeah.

2465
03:45:39,790 --> 03:45:48,150
okay i have i there's no way i can push yeah i can't push i shouldn't push him into it

2466
03:45:51,410 --> 03:45:56,150
okay i have to make it so that it keeps bouncing

2467
03:46:04,520 --> 03:46:09,180
okay all you have to do is not hit okay there you go

2468
03:46:15,450 --> 03:46:20,170
it has to hit that box and then it should be five There we go.

2469
03:46:22,370 --> 03:46:22,650
Okay.

2470
03:46:25,770 --> 03:46:26,670
Oh my god.

2471
03:46:27,110 --> 03:46:28,270
This one is...

2472
03:46:28,270 --> 03:46:30,750
Because like, I don't want to kill the dragon there.

2473
03:46:32,950 --> 03:46:33,690
I'm not...

2474
03:46:33,690 --> 03:46:36,590
Every time I accident killed him, it was an accident.

2475
03:46:37,990 --> 03:46:38,950
We all know that.

2476
03:46:39,110 --> 03:46:40,190
It was all an accident.

2477
03:46:42,510 --> 03:46:44,330
Yeah, because like...

2478
03:46:44,330 --> 03:46:46,390
If I push it here, he'll die to these guys.

2479
03:46:48,630 --> 03:46:50,990
So I have to push it this way.

2480
03:47:00,620 --> 03:47:01,840
Oh my god.

2481
03:47:04,280 --> 03:47:05,680
Oh, come on!

2482
03:47:08,680 --> 03:47:10,260
Ruined their love!

2483
03:47:15,480 --> 03:47:16,540
Oh, that was so close.

2484
03:47:16,640 --> 03:47:17,240
I almost shot.

2485
03:47:17,620 --> 03:47:18,600
I almost got him.

2486
03:47:31,770 --> 03:47:32,150
Okay.

2487
03:47:35,940 --> 03:47:37,260
Where the fuck are you?

2488
03:47:38,480 --> 03:47:39,480
That was so close.

2489
03:47:39,540 --> 03:47:41,780
I don't even know which is how I got that shot, to be fair.

2490
03:47:44,220 --> 03:47:45,600
There you go.

2491
03:47:45,860 --> 03:47:46,400
Right in the middle.

2492
03:47:48,420 --> 03:47:49,440
Where did my bullet go?

2493
03:47:51,700 --> 03:47:54,680
It was right in the middle.

2494
03:47:55,080 --> 03:47:56,460
Where did the bullet go?

2495
03:47:57,480 --> 03:48:01,280
I swear to God.

2496
03:48:15,740 --> 03:48:17,440
I assume that.

2497
03:48:21,120 --> 03:48:23,020
I assume that was.

2498
03:48:23,040 --> 03:48:24,400
It wasn't gonna happen.

2499
03:48:27,400 --> 03:48:28,580
Oh my god.

2500
03:48:30,320 --> 03:48:31,740
Simple geometry is so hard.

2501
03:48:34,500 --> 03:48:36,600
Guys, I swear to you guys, it wasn't that.

2502
03:48:36,700 --> 03:48:37,980
That was not what I assumed.

2503
03:48:44,220 --> 03:48:45,200
Okay, right here.

2504
03:48:49,820 --> 03:48:51,220
Okay, not right.

2505
03:48:52,860 --> 03:48:54,460
Not right there.

2506
03:48:59,140 --> 03:48:59,740
I'm sorry.

2507
03:49:00,800 --> 03:49:02,200
I'm sorry.

2508
03:49:02,800 --> 03:49:03,740
Where is it?

2509
03:49:03,780 --> 03:49:05,820
I just want to kill you.

2510
03:49:06,240 --> 03:49:07,660
I don't understand.

2511
03:49:11,380 --> 03:49:15,400
I have to push this up because of the explosion.

2512
03:49:26,340 --> 03:49:27,960
Push this box in?

2513
03:49:28,120 --> 03:49:29,700
But what about the explosion?

2514
03:49:29,880 --> 03:49:30,940
Look he's in it.

2515
03:49:32,400 --> 03:49:33,580
He's in the...

2516
03:49:33,580 --> 03:49:35,040
He's in the...

2517
03:49:35,040 --> 03:49:35,900
The...

2518
03:49:35,900 --> 03:49:37,160
Last area.

2519
03:49:45,430 --> 03:49:46,150
Bye, Dad.

2520
03:49:46,390 --> 03:49:47,230
Literally him.

2521
03:49:48,150 --> 03:49:49,870
I get one more push, really?

2522
03:49:51,270 --> 03:49:52,130
No, I don't.

2523
03:49:52,430 --> 03:49:52,750
See?

2524
03:49:54,430 --> 03:49:55,030
Yeah.

2525
03:49:55,990 --> 03:49:55,990
I was gonna

2526
03:50:01,100 --> 03:50:04,880
say, I'm pretty sure I don't get one more push.

2527
03:50:13,310 --> 03:50:13,890
Maybe here.

2528
03:50:22,370 --> 03:50:23,090
Maybe here.

2529
03:50:23,730 --> 03:50:24,170
Oh, shit.

2530
03:50:24,270 --> 03:50:44,830
here okay oh my god geometry is so hard oh my god where the fuck is my bullets going this way are you serious

2531
03:51:06,830 --> 03:51:08,070
It's okay, Doki.

2532
03:51:08,170 --> 03:51:09,830
I was never good at geology.

2533
03:51:13,250 --> 03:51:13,950
I don't know.

2534
03:51:14,350 --> 03:51:15,690
I don't know!

2535
03:51:20,520 --> 03:51:20,720
I can't.

2536
03:51:20,820 --> 03:51:24,920
If I push him up and I kill him, they blast, they blast him.

2537
03:51:30,840 --> 03:51:31,500
See this?

2538
03:51:32,440 --> 03:51:33,480
God damn it hit.

2539
03:51:33,620 --> 03:51:40,320
Oh, wait, no, if that hit it, it would, like, do it, uh...

2540
03:51:40,320 --> 03:51:45,400
Eventually, if I brute force it enough, something will work.

2541
03:51:47,000 --> 03:51:49,060
Podwatch, you skip 30 minutes.

2542
03:51:49,980 --> 03:51:51,080
Something will happen.

2543
03:51:55,000 --> 03:51:55,520
Okay.

2544
03:51:56,300 --> 03:51:57,400
I got this.

2545
03:52:05,010 --> 03:52:05,750
Here we go.

2546
03:52:06,990 --> 03:52:07,610
Okay, no.

2547
03:52:18,260 --> 03:52:19,680
Are we here?

2548
03:52:27,540 --> 03:52:29,380
Like, I don't know where it's ending.

2549
03:52:32,580 --> 03:52:35,300
No, the devs said I'm moving the right box.

2550
03:52:36,180 --> 03:52:38,660
It's literally wherever I'm positioning.

2551
03:52:39,580 --> 03:52:43,420
It's like my positioning is what I have to figure out.

2552
03:52:48,800 --> 03:52:50,740
So I know I'm moving the right box.

2553
03:52:51,960 --> 03:52:53,820
out simple geometry.

2554
03:53:00,100 --> 03:53:01,280
Oh my god.

2555
03:53:01,460 --> 03:53:02,220
I swear to god.

2556
03:53:03,160 --> 03:53:03,160
Please.

2557
03:53:14,560 --> 03:53:15,700
It's not.

2558
03:53:16,140 --> 03:53:17,220
It's not easy.

2559
03:53:20,320 --> 03:53:22,820
I was never good at geometry, guys.

2560
03:53:25,120 --> 03:53:26,060
I did it!

2561
03:53:26,740 --> 03:53:27,780
I did it!

2562
03:53:31,840 --> 03:53:34,380
I Oh my god, I did.

2563
03:53:36,080 --> 03:53:36,620
Finally.

2564
03:53:38,400 --> 03:53:40,460
Finally, Doki, you're back.

2565
03:53:41,180 --> 03:53:43,180
I'm sorry, this is all my fault.

2566
03:53:43,620 --> 03:53:46,500
Hey, don't go stealing credit for my kills.

2567
03:53:47,020 --> 03:53:49,160
No, I mean, we caused this.

2568
03:53:49,420 --> 03:53:52,400
You're gone for so long, and we really miss you.

2569
03:53:53,140 --> 03:53:54,660
Take that geometry.

2570
03:53:58,920 --> 03:54:00,620
Jeez, what happened to you all?

2571
03:54:00,780 --> 03:54:01,100
Hello?

2572
03:54:01,460 --> 03:54:02,920
Oh my god, my voice is dying.

2573
03:54:02,920 --> 03:54:08,360
I guess if he doesn't want to answer, there's only one way to find out.

2574
03:54:10,960 --> 03:54:13,400
Wait, guys, how many more levels are there?

2575
03:54:13,880 --> 03:54:17,540
As Doki and men enter a room, a low feminine voice rings out.

2576
03:54:18,820 --> 03:54:21,540
So you finally arrive, Doki bird.

2577
03:54:22,460 --> 03:54:23,440
There is 12?

2578
03:54:24,020 --> 03:54:25,500
Guys, oh, three more?

2579
03:54:25,640 --> 03:54:25,960
Okay.

2580
03:54:26,540 --> 03:54:28,240
Are you the one behind all this?

2581
03:54:28,680 --> 03:54:30,940
Give me back my dragoons.

2582
03:54:31,580 --> 03:54:32,600
Oh, is this Doki?

2583
03:54:33,340 --> 03:54:35,560
Do you really deserve them?

2584
03:54:36,860 --> 03:54:37,580
What do you mean?

2585
03:54:38,160 --> 03:54:42,860
I came all the way here and beat your robots just to get them back.

2586
03:54:44,080 --> 03:54:48,970
The shouted figure walks forward and yet they made me like...

2587
03:54:57,000 --> 03:54:57,600
Huh?

2588
03:54:59,300 --> 03:55:01,080
They did what?

2589
03:55:01,580 --> 03:55:03,720
Oh, I should have left them here.

2590
03:55:04,360 --> 03:55:05,000
What is that?

2591
03:55:05,140 --> 03:55:06,660
Why are you so...

2592
03:55:06,880 --> 03:55:09,820
Very, very low track goes.

2593
03:55:10,740 --> 03:55:11,560
Jingle, jingle.

2594
03:55:12,080 --> 03:55:13,800
You get the picture.

2595
03:55:14,720 --> 03:55:15,580
Jingle, jingle?

2596
03:55:16,400 --> 03:55:16,820
Okay.

2597
03:55:17,260 --> 03:55:19,140
But why did you kidnap them?

2598
03:55:19,700 --> 03:55:20,900
I'm a robot.

2599
03:55:21,320 --> 03:55:23,520
I gotta try taking over the world.

2600
03:55:23,960 --> 03:55:25,780
That's like our whole thing.

2601
03:55:26,580 --> 03:55:28,440
Okay, you gotta put...

2602
03:55:28,440 --> 03:55:31,580
Guys, why fight peace and love?

2603
03:55:31,680 --> 03:55:33,460
There could be both of us.

2604
03:55:34,760 --> 03:55:36,860
Guys, two jingles.

2605
03:55:36,880 --> 03:55:37,820
jangles.

2606
03:55:38,540 --> 03:55:39,800
Think about it, chat.

2607
03:55:41,700 --> 03:55:46,100
We can get four jingles, guys.

2608
03:55:50,640 --> 03:55:52,580
Two is better than one.

2609
03:55:53,000 --> 03:55:55,000
And you know what's better than two?

2610
03:55:55,640 --> 03:55:56,140
Four.

2611
03:56:02,420 --> 03:56:04,960
Okay, you got a point there.

2612
03:56:06,060 --> 03:56:08,280
We're still going to take you down, though.

2613
03:56:08,660 --> 03:56:12,540
Give me back my dragon so I can punish them for being unfaithful.

2614
03:56:12,860 --> 03:56:13,580
Come on, then.

2615
03:56:13,840 --> 03:56:15,640
Let's see what you've got.

2616
03:56:16,900 --> 03:56:23,500
Sorry, I have nothing on, but if you could have to, you could convince us, but thank you for the super chat.

2617
03:56:23,720 --> 03:56:23,800
Thank you.

2618
03:56:26,160 --> 03:56:26,960
Okay, guys.

2619
03:56:27,160 --> 03:56:30,080
My voice is actually feeling very... Okay, wait.

2620
03:56:30,140 --> 03:56:31,120
What happens when I just shoot her?

2621
03:56:31,760 --> 03:56:33,160
Okay, nothing happens.

2622
03:56:34,540 --> 03:56:35,020
Okay.

2623
03:56:35,180 --> 03:56:44,440
How many... Guys, Okay, I think my voice is feeling incredibly...

2624
03:56:44,440 --> 03:56:45,220
I'm so sorry.

2625
03:56:45,240 --> 03:56:46,600
I really want to finish this.

2626
03:56:46,660 --> 03:56:47,060
We'll do it.

2627
03:56:47,060 --> 03:56:48,340
We'll finish it tomorrow.

2628
03:56:49,020 --> 03:56:49,460
I'm not tomorrow.

2629
03:56:49,560 --> 03:56:49,660
Sorry.

2630
03:56:49,740 --> 03:56:51,420
We'll finish it next week, guys.

2631
03:56:51,940 --> 03:56:53,180
We'll finish it next week.

2632
03:56:53,560 --> 03:56:56,900
But my voice is feeling very strange right now.

2633
03:56:56,980 --> 03:56:58,480
So I have to call it.

2634
03:56:58,840 --> 03:57:05,040
And I know that you guys really want me to finish this.

2635
03:57:06,880 --> 03:57:11,280
We will finish this game, but I think I'm really pushing it with my voice.

2636
03:57:11,620 --> 03:57:12,680
So I'm going to call it here.

2637
03:57:13,220 --> 03:57:15,840
And like, I don't really want to shoot Dough Kitty right now.

2638
03:57:21,060 --> 03:57:22,740
So I'm really sorry.

2639
03:57:23,320 --> 03:57:27,120
I, my voice is really feeling incredibly strained right now.

2640
03:57:27,420 --> 03:57:34,800
So I'm going to, I have to, I have for the sake of my throat, for the sake of my throat, I will finish it next week.

2641
03:57:34,940 --> 03:57:36,040
But thank you guys.

2642
03:57:36,180 --> 03:57:36,860
Oh my God.

2643
03:57:36,880 --> 03:57:39,240
It was really, really fun.

2644
03:57:40,340 --> 03:57:42,360
It was so fun checking.

2645
03:57:42,440 --> 03:57:42,980
Actually, no.

2646
03:57:43,700 --> 03:57:45,860
Instead of finishing, I could just watch the thing.

2647
03:57:46,420 --> 03:57:48,260
We'll watch the dokey proof because I don't think we...

2648
03:57:48,260 --> 03:57:49,940
I think I'm going to struggle.

2649
03:57:50,140 --> 03:57:50,820
Actually, you're right.

2650
03:57:50,940 --> 03:57:52,080
Maybe I should just watch it.

2651
03:57:52,380 --> 03:57:52,700
All right.

2652
03:57:54,360 --> 03:57:54,980
All right.

2653
03:57:55,060 --> 03:57:56,740
Let's just...

2654
03:57:58,900 --> 03:58:00,640
Let's just watch the solution.

2655
03:58:03,060 --> 03:58:04,160
Where is it?

2656
03:58:04,860 --> 03:58:05,340
All right.

2657
03:58:06,880 --> 03:58:09,020
It's like, it's like I'm playing the game.

2658
03:58:10,320 --> 03:58:13,320
It's almost like I'm playing the game, guys.

2659
03:58:13,940 --> 03:58:15,100
Alright, let's see it.

2660
03:58:16,720 --> 03:58:17,020
Oh.

2661
03:58:18,260 --> 03:58:19,400

2662
03:58:19,600 --> 03:58:19,820
Wait.

2663
03:58:21,940 --> 03:58:22,460
Alright.

2664
03:58:23,440 --> 03:58:25,240
Okay, let's fix this real quick.

2665
03:58:25,720 --> 03:58:25,920
Nope.

2666
03:58:26,520 --> 03:58:27,460
God damn it.

2667
03:58:28,060 --> 03:58:28,700
Uh.

2668
03:58:28,900 --> 03:58:30,180
Where is it?

2669
03:58:32,840 --> 03:58:33,900
Where the fuck?

2670
03:58:34,040 --> 03:58:34,420

For the sake of my mental health.

2675
03:59:32,820 --> 03:59:35,500
I don't want to get one guy no more.

2676
03:59:36,200 --> 03:59:39,240
I don't want to get one guy.

2677
03:59:41,500 --> 03:59:42,040
Alright.

2678
03:59:44,720 --> 03:59:45,360

First try.

2686
04:01:01,780 --> 04:01:03,220
The conveyor belt shifts.

2687
04:01:04,700 --> 04:01:06,380
Robo-Doki quickly jumps off.

2688
04:01:06,660 --> 04:01:07,640
Running and cowering.

2689
04:01:08,140 --> 04:01:09,760
Robo-goons, protect me!

2690
04:01:10,820 --> 04:01:11,900
I'm so good.

2691
04:01:12,180 --> 04:01:12,740
Holy shit.

2692
04:01:13,100 --> 04:01:14,160
Wait, I am a gamer.

2693
04:01:14,880 --> 04:01:16,080
How is she so good at...

2694
04:01:16,080 --> 04:01:19,440
Guys, I went back to school just to retake geometry, guys.

2695
04:01:19,780 --> 04:01:22,680
Now, why else am I in my schoolgirl outfit?

2696
04:01:23,320 --> 04:01:26,000
I went back to school just for geometry.

2697
04:01:27,720 --> 04:01:28,920
Okay, you made it.

2698
04:01:28,940 --> 04:01:31,800
pass soon, but this isn't even my final form.

2699
04:01:32,180 --> 04:01:33,740
Let's see how you like this.

2700
04:01:36,020 --> 04:01:37,600
Robo-Doki strikes the pose.

2701
04:01:37,820 --> 04:01:38,980
Her insides were and buzz.

2702
04:01:39,060 --> 04:01:41,240
Panel sliding is clicking in the place.

2703
04:01:41,400 --> 04:01:42,420
Excuse me?

2704
04:01:43,240 --> 04:01:48,620
In a blinding flash, Robo-Doki disappears and is replaced by...

2705
04:01:48,620 --> 04:01:50,340
What's your face, by?

2706
04:01:51,780 --> 04:01:53,220
What the fuck?

2707
04:01:53,680 --> 04:01:55,360
Exactly the same...

2708
04:01:55,360 --> 04:01:57,380
Wait, that wasn't supposed to happen.

2709
04:01:57,920 --> 04:02:00,540
Those dragoons They built me wrong.

2710
04:02:00,720 --> 04:02:01,360
I don't know.

2711
04:02:01,520 --> 04:02:03,120
I think they did a pretty good job.

2712
04:02:03,480 --> 04:02:05,800
You still have way more hits than anyone else.

2713
04:02:05,940 --> 04:02:07,240
What the fuck?

2714
04:02:07,340 --> 04:02:09,660
You did a pretty good job.

2715
04:02:13,160 --> 04:02:14,080
Oh, come on.

2716
04:02:14,140 --> 04:02:15,260
Don't tell me.

2717
04:02:15,600 --> 04:02:16,580
No, I'm just saying.

2718
04:02:16,700 --> 04:02:18,240
Your design is pretty cool.

2719
04:02:18,560 --> 04:02:19,660
Jingle, jingle, jingle.

2720
04:02:20,340 --> 04:02:21,740
Yes, my design.

2721
04:02:22,160 --> 04:02:22,480
Totally.

2722
04:02:23,440 --> 04:02:26,420
Doki walks towards Robo Doki reaching out.

2723
04:02:26,720 --> 04:02:28,520
So, like, look at this accent.

2724
04:02:28,860 --> 04:02:29,460
It's so...

2725
04:02:29,460 --> 04:02:30,380
Yeah, yeah, the accent.

2726
04:02:30,400 --> 04:02:57,580
accent hey don't get so close and what if i do robo dokey are you some kind of um i am a robo connoisseur okay i'm here to appreciate the fine details i know how you feel about robots don't even try to hide it that's not important what you're literally what

2727
04:03:01,870 --> 04:03:07,010
I admit it's watching in the chair right now as Toki and her robot.

2728
04:03:07,530 --> 04:03:07,910
I can't.

2729
04:03:10,950 --> 04:03:11,850
I don't...
