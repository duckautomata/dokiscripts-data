1
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,520
Hello, everybody!

2
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,100
Hello, hello!

3
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:56,000
Sorry I had to push the stream up by 30 minutes because I needed to sleep!

4
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,560
Why must I needed to sleep?

5
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:03,240
Well, I got fucking baited!

6
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,440
What do you mean by baited, Doki?

7
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,960
Alright, so, story time!

8
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,160
Story time!

9
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,760
So, yesterday, I was really nervous.

10
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,120
I was really, really nervous because I saw that...

11
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:21,800
Numbers were getting... The top 500 leaderboards for Marble Rivals was, like, climbing.

12
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,260
And I got really, really scared.

13
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:30,160
So, I was like... I was like to the Super Gomez...

14
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,360
I was like, man, I'm scared.

15
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,660
It feels like the numbers are going so fast.

16
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:39,860
Why?

17
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,020
Are you sure I'm safe?

18
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:51,120
And then... Sorry, my brain is still powering up because I literally just slept for, like, two hours.

19
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,100
So, I had two hours of sleep.

20
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,280
But after this stream, I'm gonna sleep some more.

21
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,940
And then we're going back tomorrow.

22
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:02,240
Anyway, so I was just like, I'm getting really scared.

23
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:07,880
Because, you know, it seems like it's climbing really fast.

24
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,600
Are you sure my number is safe?

25
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,040
And then... They thought about it for a while now.

26
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,260
And they're like, it's time to get on.

27
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,020
It's time.

28
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,180
Let's go gambling!

29
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,680
We just need to win two games.

30
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,320
Let's go gambling!

31
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,500
And I'm like, are you sure?

32
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,680
Are you sure we take that risk?

33
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,880
And they're like, yeah!

34
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,420
Fuck it!

35
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,860
We lost three games in a row.

36
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,660
And then... Alright...

37
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:47,400
Anyway... Anyway, so... Guys...

38
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:52,360
Maybe let's not go gambling.

39
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,500
So... Anyway... Anyway... Yeah, you fucking stalkers.

40
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:08,780
I know you guys were looking at... You guys were looking at my progress.

41
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,780
Anyway, so...

42
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:22,840
After that, it was... At one point, I was stuck at 200 points for 8 plus hours.

43
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,960
Like, I'm not even gonna hide the fact how long it took me to...

44
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:35,120
It took me the entire night and a little bit of the day...

45
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,380
To get back to what I was before.

46
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:44,800
And also be plus 20 more points than what I was.

47
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,360
So now I'm 285.

48
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,540
I'm 285.

49
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:54,940
And I hope... I hope it's safe.

50
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:59,120
I... I... I... Anyway...

51
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:05,760
Anyway, can anyone tell me what the cutoff... Anyone who has the leaderboard up, I would love to know what the cutoff is right now.

52
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,120
Because I think I have like 3 to 4 more hours now.

53
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:16,760
So like, we're assuming that 280... Oh, it's still 251!

54
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:25,000
Anyway, during the middle of... Oh, it's at 258 right now.

55
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,180
Okay, I think it's safe.

56
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:32,680
I think... I think it's... I think it's safe.

57
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,300
I... No, no, no.

58
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,360
I'm second-doubting myself again.

59
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:50,140
It climbed to 7 points within the 2 hours I was napping.

60
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:53,360
Oh my god, it should be safe.

61
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,460
Toki, don't think about it.

62
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,100
Toki, Toki, don't think about it.

63
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,900
It should be safe.

64
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,860
Don't think about...

65
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,500
Okay, anyway.

66
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,400
Anyway.

67
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,900
Anyway, so...

68
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:15,720
That's why I had to push the stream 30 minutes more.

69
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:21,860
Because I was like, I can't... I need to sleep.

70
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,180
And then...

71
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:29,760
I could've just played in the morning, but they were like, what if you don't make it?

72
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,520
And I was like, oh my god, what if I don't make it?

73
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:36,240
I invested so... What if I don't make it?

74
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,100
And then I showed up.

75
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,360
And then they were like, it's E5.

76
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,800
Let's go gambling.

77
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,180
And I'm like, but god... I'm so easily... I'm so easily convinced to do anything.

78
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:46,600
I'm...

79
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,340
I'm just so...

80
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:55,620
It's like they're like, oh, but what if... And you're like, you're right.

81
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,060
You're right.

82
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,220
Let me get on right now.

83
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:01,320
Let me... Let me get on right now.

84
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,600
I fooled it.

85
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,880
I got baited.

86
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,840
I fooled it so easily.

87
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,760
And then I had to... Oh my god.

88
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,060
And then now I'm here.

89
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:12,580
It's okay.

90
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,660
They're like... And then like...

91
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:18,340
My manager was like, it's okay if you cancel the bilateral...

92
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:22,520
And I'm like, I will not cancel the bilateral stream.

93
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:26,540
Marvel Rivals does not dictate my life.

94
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,600
I am in control.

95
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:36,280
I was like, I refuse to cancel bilateral because of Rivals.

96
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,080
I am in control of my life.

97
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,660
So that's why I'm here too.

98
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,060
That's why I'm still here.

99
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,640
Because I still really, really wanted to stream for you guys.

100
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,380
But did not want to stream Marvel Rivals.

101
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:57,580
I was gonna be streaming Marvel Rivals at like 1 in the morning.

102
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,480
But I did not want to replace today's stream with Rivals.

103
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,260
I am in control of my own destiny.

104
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,700
Anyway, I'm okay, guys.

105
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,580
By the way, I'm...

106
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,320
I'm in control.

107
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:13,920
Anyway.

108
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,580
Another update.

109
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:21,620
I got invited to do the Marvel Rivals Twitch Rivals.

110
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,680
Well, not invited.

111
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,660
I literally pestered the Twitch staff like three...

112
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:31,260
Like several times to be like, hey, I heard about the Marvel Rivals Twitch Rivals.

113
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,360
Can I be in it?

114
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,560
They're like, hey, oh yeah.

115
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,700
Sorry, we're on vacation.

116
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:35,900
We gotta check later.

117
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:36,720
I was like, alright.

118
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,660
And then like one or two days later, I was like, so do you still have a spot?

119
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,840
And they're like, oh, well, let me look into it.

120
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:44,700
And I'm like, oh, cool.

121
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,100
Please let me know if you do.

122
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,560
And then like finally, they're like, oh, yeah.

123
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,600
Are you sure you really want...

124
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,200
We might be able to do something.

125
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,720
And they're like, are you sure you really want the spot?

126
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,220
I was like, yeah, I love the spot.

127
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,080
I was like, let me in!

128
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,360
I'm just like, yeah.

129
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,920
I basically like pushed them.

130
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,520
I basically was like at the door.

131
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,880
Let me in!

132
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:18,880
So I'm now like, I will be participating in the Marvel Rivals, Twitch Rivals.

133
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,500
And like, oh my God, like I'm a team captain for it.

134
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,140
So I'm bringing my own team there.

135
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,860
And like the competition is very...

136
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,260
I can't leak the captains.

137
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:28,920
There's...

138
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,980
It's fucking weird.

139
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:34,360
All I'm saying is that because I asked them, can they show me the teams that they're getting?

140
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:38,300
And so like I know competitively like who I'm going to get.

141
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:49,080
And then like I looked at the list and like literally like I believe like half the captains are incredible try hard FPS streamers.

142
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,460
And then half of them, they're going to get absolutely destroyed.

143
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:57,220
I saw the team list and I was like, oh man.

144
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,680
I know for sure that this team captain is going to bring a full try hard roster.

145
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,920
And then there's a team that's just Minecraft players.

146
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,080
And then I was like, oh man.

147
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,380
I was like,

148
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:25,500
oh, that does not look ideal for that team over there.

149
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:32,220
I was looking at the captains and like who they're bringing.

150
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:35,460
I'm like, oh, what the fuck?

151
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:39,240
This team brought like an entire professional team.

152
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,460
And then this other team is just Minecraft.

153
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,140
What could possibly go wrong?

154
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:52,900
So anyway, the limitations is that I can bring four players.

155
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,080
I mean, three players, including me.

156
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:59,140
But basically I can bring like four players, including me.

157
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,800
That's above diamond rank.

158
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:08,480
So obviously I'm going to choose one above all because I don't want to get absolutely destroyed on stream.

159
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:15,420
So but like some teams, it's just like they would only have one player.

160
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,460
That's one above all.

161
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:24,440
And then the rest is really like the rest is like diamond, diamond players.

162
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,680
I'm like, why?

163
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,600
You have an option to bring four players.

164
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,860
That's diamond or above.

165
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,040
Why the fuck would you bring it?

166
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,500
Like, why would you choose?

167
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,160
Obviously, I'm bringing four players.

168
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,360
That's one above all.

169
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:41,760
I'm not.

170
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,920
And then the other two.

171
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,420
I mean, I'm bringing three players.

172
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,940
That's going to be one above all.

173
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:49,320
And then two players are going to be like below diamond.

174
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,080
And I'm like, that is...

175
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,160
For the five...

176
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:59,540
Guys, it's not going to be fives when I fucking get full held in spawn.

177
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:05,160
I refuse to be full held.

178
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,040
That's not fives, guys.

179
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,920
That's absolutely not fives.

180
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,920
It doesn't matter if you're like, oh man, but these are my fives.

181
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,540
They're not going to be possible.

182
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,400
I saw the team's list, guys.

183
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,980
I saw it.

184
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,940
It was literally like...

185
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:25,480
Okay.

186
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,140
Like, one of the captains is fucking Shroud.

187
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:35,060
Do you really think Shroud's going to be like, alright guys, let me bring the easy...

188
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,180
You really...

189
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,620
I know Shroud's bringing pro players into the tournament.

190
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,320
And then the other team was minecrafters.

191
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,040
Oh my god.

192
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,360
I'm like, you really...

193
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,400
I know like...

194
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,720
And I already know some of the...

195
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,340
Because like, it wasn't in the team's list.

196
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,660
But I already know some of the players that Shroud's assembling.

197
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,360
And some of them were from the tournament.

198
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,900
And I was like, bro.

199
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,620
I'm going to do that.

200
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,780
That's like...

201
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,720
I was like, I'm not here to get absolutely destroyed.

202
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,280
I am not here.

203
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,840
Oh, it's alright.

204
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,400
They don't watch me on YouTube anyway.

205
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:19,800
Like...

206
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,840
Oh, so by the way.

207
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,280
I got double...

208
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,300
Okay.

209
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:27,120
I got like, double, triple confirmed.

210
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,280
That like...

211
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,340
That's fucked.

212
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,120
But I'm also...

213
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,300
Yes, if they're going to do it, I'm going to do it too.

214
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,380
Also, another update.

215
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,720
I found out that like...

216
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,920
You know how I was like, oh yeah.

217
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:43,160
Like, I was getting stream sniped almost like every day when I was streaming on Twitch.

218
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,180
I...

219
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:48,640
Double, triple confirmed that like...

220
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:52,940
During the fucked up hours, I was trying to make sure I was secure in top 500.

221
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,760
They were like, yeah.

222
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,240
They saw that it was like a way...

223
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,900
They saw that you were sort of like, you know.

224
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,540
It would have been so easy to get points off of you.

225
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,120
Because, you know, you were stacking with us.

226
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,160
And obviously...

227
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,400
And I'm like...

228
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,680
And you were obviously, you know, not a pro player.

229
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,200
So like, they also made that for stack.

230
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,480
Because you were just so...

231
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,140
You know.

232
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,200
And I was like, that's fucked up.

233
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,040
I was like...

234
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,160
I was like...

235
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,640
I'm just a little guy.

236
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,460
That's actually so fucked up.

237
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,560
They're like, yeah.

238
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,340
Like, you know.

239
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,640
It was just...

240
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,820
Out of the...

241
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:33,380
Like, you know.

242
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,180
Since...

243
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,100
Since you're...

244
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,300
You're obviously going to go against the stack.

245
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,700
You were obviously like, you know, the weakest link.

246
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,820
And it would be very easy to get points off of it.

247
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,320
I'm like, that's so fucked up.

248
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,640
Like, I...

249
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,040
I'm just a little guy.

250
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:54,740
I'm literally...

251
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,500
Bro, they literally like, fucking...

252
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,600
Like, I'm a baby.

253
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,800
And they literally like, saw the baby in the playground.

254
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,040
And they just like, grabbed the baby.

255
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,800
And then just chucked it into the ocean.

256
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,160
Because they're like, oh, look at her.

257
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,220
That's...

258
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:16,860
That's basically how I felt after finding that out.

259
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:17,580
Anyway.

260
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:18,840
But outro.

261
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:19,700
We're...

262
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:19,960
Sorry.

263
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,300
Now, that's the life update for everybody.

264
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,700
That's why I had to push the stream 30 minutes.

265
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:30,860
And like, a lot of stuff happened in between yesterday and today.

266
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,620
Because I'm fucking weak.

267
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,020
To like, I guess...

268
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:38,860
I'm very weak and easily persuadable to do certain things.

269
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:42,020
And sadly, I was very weak.

270
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,240
And like, they're like, I don't know.

271
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,000
Maybe it's not safe.

272
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,200
You should get on.

273
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,580
And I was like, you're right.

274
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,040
I should get on.

275
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:55,760
Okay.

276
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,640
Okay.

277
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,080
Alright.

278
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:00,340
So, I also need you guys to know.

279
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,560
I didn't record the session.

280
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:07,260
Because like, after we lost three games in a row at the beginning.

281
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:10,540
I was like, this is not gonna be a good time.

282
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:11,400
I had a feeling.

283
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,620
So I just like, stopped recording anything.

284
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,040
But I definitely crashed out during that grind.

285
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:22,440
Because I went to bed at 2 PM.

286
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,760
So, or 3 PM.

287
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:29,020
So like, it was not a great day.

288
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,040
It was not a great night.

289
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:36,520
And at one point, I kept getting targeted.

290
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,640
By this fucking Black Panther.

291
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,200
And then like, in my stack.

292
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,200
They were like, whoa Doki.

293
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:48,940
Because I was like, I hope your family dies.

294
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,100
In game.

295
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,640
In game.

296
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,080
Because I was so...

297
00:16:53,080 --> 00:17:01,380
And then like, it was said with so much like, vitriol.

298
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:04,980
I was like, I was so tired.

299
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,360
I was so tired of this Black Panther.

300
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,360
Diving me every time.

301
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:17,520
And then I was like, and then when he dived me one last time.

302
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,080
I was like, I hope your family dies.

303
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,140
In game.

304
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,860
And then my entire group was like, whoa.

305
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:37,380
Because I didn't hit that level of like, I'm so done before.

306
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,860
Until that moment.

307
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:43,180
I was just incredibly done.

308
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,200
Alright, Bellatro.

309
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,080
Bellatro.

310
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,580
Bellatro.

311
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,840
So, I have no idea what this game is about.

312
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:58,700
But I have heard a lot of good things about it.

313
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,880
Like, everybody was telling me how like, it's incredibly addicting.

314
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:02,860
Which is great.

315
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:07,160
Like, someone was like, I saw some people in my chat was like.

316
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:13,680
That's great that you're trying to replace your alcoholic addiction with smoking.

317
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,440
That's bad.

318
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,440
They're like, wow.

319
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,080
Good for you.

320
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:27,880
For ruining, you're trying to ruin your life via other means now.

321
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:32,320
So, I'm a little worried now because of it.

322
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:35,200
Because everyone was telling me that this game is incredibly addicting.

323
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:41,640
And that it's also, it's like, people can play like, super long hours.

324
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:47,380
And like, a lot of people try to do like, treatments for it.

325
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,400
Like, trying to get like, finish some runs.

326
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,520
Oh my gosh.

327
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,660
Also like, I didn't read the full email.

328
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,220
But somebody like, I don't know.

329
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:58,740
Somebody sent, like my manager told me that somebody sent an email.

330
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:04,120
Trying to, like giving me a tutorial of how to beat the first level.

331
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,500
I guess like, because they were worried about me.

332
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,800
I didn't read it.

333
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,020
So like, I'm sorry.

334
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:11,920
Sorry.

335
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,960
I didn't read it.

336
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,280
So like, I guess you're gonna still have to suffer.

337
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,460
I'm sorry.

338
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,440
I had other things to worry about.

339
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,540
Also, Kilandria, thank you for the 50 gifted chips.

340
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,740
Thank you, thank you.

341
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,140
I really appreciate it.

342
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,780
And thank you for the super chat.

343
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:33,740
Thank you, thank you.

344
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:34,560
Hello, Mitoki.

345
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,520
Don't worry, Mito.

346
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,340
I'm also stupid.

347
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,500
Thank you for the super chat.

348
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,360
Thank you, thank you.

349
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,020
Sombra, thank you for the super chat.

350
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,160
Thank you, thank you.

351
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,420
This game is weirdly addicting.

352
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,440
Fortunately, you're already a rival's addict.

353
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,460
Thank you for the super chat.

354
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,460
Thank you, thank you.

355
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,960
Yeah, that's why I'm a little worried.

356
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,300
Because apparently, it's incredibly addicting.

357
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,120
And I'm already like, suffering via other addictions at the moment.

358
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,460
So like, I don't know if it's good to combine two addictions.

359
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,580
Bite Size, thank you for the Akasupa.

360
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,200
Thank you, thank you.

361
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:04,960
Hey, Doki.

362
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:05,960
Today is my birthday.

363
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,220
Last year started very rough for me, but ended absolutely incredible.

364
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,060
Better than I could have hoped.

365
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,040
I want to say thank you for being a big reason why it turned out so great.

366
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,200
I'm very happy to share this day with you and the Drakkos.

367
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,120
Thank you for the Akasupa.

368
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,640
Bite Size, thank you, thank you.

369
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,300
Happy birthday to you.

370
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,940
Happy birthday to you.

371
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,780
Happy birthday, dear Bite Size.

372
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,340
Happy birthday to you.

373
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:25,920
Yeah!

374
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,140
Thank you again for the Akasupa.

375
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,220
Thank you, thank you.

376
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,340
Alright, so like I said, I have no idea what's going...

377
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,460
I have no idea how to play this game.

378
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,440
So we're going to learn as...

379
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,480
I'm going to go in blind, as always.

380
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,120
I'm going to go in fucking blind.

381
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,800
What's the worst that could happen?

382
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:51,240
My entire chat yelling at me as I play the wrong card?

383
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,240
What else is new?

384
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,300
Alright.

385
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,060
Alright, here we go.

386
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:00,880
Loutro!

387
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,720
I don't know...

388
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,300
It's been a while, Sound Guy.

389
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,940
I hope you're still alive.

390
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:06,720
Like, I...

391
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,360
I hope you're still alive, but it's time.

392
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:13,620
We're coming back to the sound now.

393
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,140
Thank you for the super chat.

394
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:16,920
Thank you, thank you.

395
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,580
Wait a minute.

396
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,220
This isn't Marvel Rivals.

397
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,580
Can't believe the title isn't Clickbait.

398
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,780
Shake my head.

399
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:23,900
Thank you for the super chat.

400
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,380
Thank you, thank you.

401
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,440
Oh my god, it's time.

402
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,280
It's Belotro time.

403
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:31,520
Uh...

404
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,500
Hello there.

405
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,020
My name is Jimbo.

406
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,160
Also, Nick, welcome to the tomato farm.

407
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:37,980
Tomato farm.

408
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,080
Welcome, welcome.

409
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,040
I'm here to help you learn how to play.

410
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:41,900
Hello.

411
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:46,300
Your goal is to earn chips to defeat the enemy blind.

412
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,360
This here is a small blind.

413
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:52,820
You only need to score 300 chips to beat it.

414
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,380
Select the small blind to start the round.

415
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,480
Oh my gosh, also 300 dollars?

416
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,500
That should be fine.

417
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,880
What am I gonna do?

418
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:03,200
End up selling my house after this?

419
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,660
Uh, Kalandria, thank you for the Akasupa.

420
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:06,680
Thank you, thank you.

421
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,680
This game ruined me.

422
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,720
Hope it does the same to you.

423
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,180
No one except Belotro, alright?

424
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:12,940
Cheer.

425
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,280
Uh, you earn chips by playing poker heads.

426
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,860
Each poker head...

427
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,560
Wait, am I supposed to know how to play poker?

428
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,760
I... wait a minute.

429
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,540
Wait a minute.

430
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,840
Am I... am I supposed to learn how to...

431
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,780
Am I supposed to know?

432
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,220
Oh, thank God.

433
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,100
Okay, cause I don't know how to play poker.

434
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,840
I absolutely have no idea what the rules are to poker.

435
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:43,460
Each poker head earns a base amount of chips multiplied by some mult.

436
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,800
See your poker hands in the run info area.

437
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:50,400
Along with other info about your current run.

438
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:51,400
Okay.

439
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,180
Straight flush five cards in a row.

440
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,320
Oh, Q, J.

441
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,360
Wait, what about king?

442
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,400
Oh, eight, nine, ten.

443
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,380
J, queen, king.

444
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,180
Four cards with the same...

445
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,220
With the same rank.

446
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,360
They may be played with one other unscored card.

447
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,200
Oh, it teaches me!

448
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,060
High card.

449
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,660
Only the highest card.

450
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:13,860
Two cards that...

451
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:14,740
Oh my God, I'm learning.

452
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,820
And should they maybe play with three others?

453
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:17,580
Okay.

454
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,120
Two pair.

455
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,960
It's a... what's the...

456
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,400
Two pairs, different ranks may be played with one other unscored card.

457
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:25,300
Oh!

458
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,040
Three of a kind.

459
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,620
Oh, that's what this means.

460
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,780
Seven, eight, nine...

461
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:31,000
Wait.

462
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,240
With all cards.

463
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,060
Oh, if it's the same suit.

464
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:36,580
Oh!

465
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,320
A three of a kind and a pair.

466
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:39,700
Okay.

467
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,720
I'm learning.

468
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,120
Cards also earning you some chips.

469
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,320
Hover over to see.

470
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,620
Okay, ten chips.

471
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,540
Now select up to five cards to play the hand.

472
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,360
Uh...

473
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,260
I have a pair.

474
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,840
Oh my God, I don't remember.

475
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,120
Pair.

476
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,560
They maybe play with three under...

477
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,380
There you go.

478
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,260
Wait, but I could do...

479
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,300
Wait, but I could do...

480
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,400
Full house.

481
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:08,180
Uh...

482
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,300
No, I could do...

483
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,120
Uh...

484
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,640
Yeah, I should do that.

485
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:17,620
I should do nine, nine, seven, five...

486
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,480
Where did you get the...

487
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:18,960
Okay, here.

488
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:19,740
This should be it.

489
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,300
Play hand.

490
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,440
There you go.

491
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,280
I got a pair.

492
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:27,640
And then I can play the random cards.

493
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,360
You can also discard up to five selected cards.

494
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,560
I'll just...

495
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,720
I'll discard this one.

496
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,380
I'll need a six, seven, eight...

497
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,400
J Queen King.

498
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,460
Oh my God!

499
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,320
I have a full...

500
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,020
I have a...

501
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,180
I have the thing!

502
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,780
You only have a limited number of...

503
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,040
Okay, I got this.

504
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,740
I'm learning.

505
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,380
Earn 300 chips before you run...

506
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:50,860
Watch this.

507
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,120
Six, seven, eight, J Queen King.

508
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,520
Hey, yo!

509
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,640
Where's my king?

510
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:00,760
Where's my king?

511
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,020
Wait!

512
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,540
Wait a minute.

513
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,840
Where did my king go?

514
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:05,860
Where...

515
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,280
Six, seven, eight...

516
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,480
Wait, what happened to my king?

517
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,040
What...

518
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:14,960
What happened?

519
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,480
What...

520
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,640
Oh, I play...

521
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,240
I need...

522
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,480
Oh, numbers.

523
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,580
Oh, numbers.

524
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,480
Oh, wait.

525
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,180
Numbers.

526
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,760
I can't count.

527
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,460
And so, thank you for the super chat.

528
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,480
Thank you, thank you.

529
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,300
I won most I had by spying jokers and planet cards.

530
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:39,180
Works every time, 80% of the time.

531
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,180
And so, thank you for the super chat though.

532
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:46,300
The numbers, man.

533
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,720
Five, six, seven, eight.

534
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,320
Okay, what can I...

535
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,240
Does that work?

536
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,340
Seven.

537
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:58,300
No, I need to beat five cards.

538
00:25:59,140 --> 00:25:59,740
No!

539
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:02,560
Um...

540
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:03,580
Flush?

541
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,420
Eight, ten.

542
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,360
Wait, what's a flush again?

543
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,020
Flush.

544
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,480
I share the same suit.

545
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:11,900
Oh!

546
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,580
Oh, one, two, three, four.

547
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,620
But I only have four.

548
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:16,280
Oh, wait.

549
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,320
If I discard...

550
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,660
I'll discard the five.

551
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:24,400
I'll discard the five and the six.

552
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,700
And then, maybe I'll get a flush.

553
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,160
And then, seven.

554
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,660
And then, maybe...

555
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:36,060
I can get a flush.

556
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,480
Up to five.

557
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,020
Oh, you're right.

558
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,500
Who needs the king as well?

559
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:40,360
You're right.

560
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:41,600
Alright.

561
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:47,040
Okay, that's not really what I wanted, but...

562
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,160
Um...

563
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:48,920
That's okay.

564
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,420
That's not...

565
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,060
I'm...

566
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:54,720
That's not what I wanted, but that's...

567
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,700
How many discards do I get?

568
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,280
I get two more discards.

569
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,820
Okay, but I do have two pairs.

570
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,900
And like, that's cooler than a flush, right?

571
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:04,500
Okay.

572
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,980
I'm with two pairs.

573
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,960
And one other unscored card.

574
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,260
And I don't need a three.

575
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,460
There we go.

576
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,400
There we go.

577
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,260
Two pairs suck?

578
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,460
But...

579
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:23,000
A flush is better, but what if I don't get the flush?

580
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,760
What if I don't get it?

581
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,360
What happened to my...

582
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,800
8, 1, 2, 3, 4.

583
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,300
I literally need one more.

584
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,100
Alright.

585
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:33,960
Nice.

586
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,080
There we go.

587
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,180
Yay!

588
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,100
Bam!

589
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,520
There's a flush right there.

590
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,640
Wait, I need 300.

591
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,020
Wait a minute.

592
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,900
I... Oh, I got it!

593
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,640
Oh my gosh.

594
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,400
Easiest game of my life.

595
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,340
God, I'm...

596
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,280
Oh, there we go.

597
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,180
I'm so fucking smart.

598
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,400
Didn't re-chat at all for that.

599
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,940
JR, thank you for the super chat.

600
00:27:59,020 --> 00:27:59,900
Thank you, thank you.

601
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,800
Guys, can't get addictive.

602
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,120
Don't know how to smoke it.

603
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,520
Thank you for the super chat.

604
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,500
Guys, thank you, thank you.

605
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:09,480
Alright.

606
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,680
It's a...

607
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,700
That's slow?

608
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,180
What do you mean?

609
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,540
Oh my god, it's on the slowest speed.

610
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,080
That's slow?

611
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:18,680
It's...

612
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,740
It's going by incredibly fast for me.

613
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,160
Nicely done.

614
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,360
Now that you're flushed with cash, you can buy some new cards from the shop.

615
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,140
But I can buy new...

616
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,780
Try buying the handsome devil.

617
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:30,880
Okay.

618
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,440
Alright.

619
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,800
This is one of the one...

620
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,820
Oh, bring down the music?

621
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,460
Okay, let me bring down the music.

622
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:38,540
After this.

623
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:43,780
This is one of the 150 jokers you can add to your run.

624
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,380
Every joker does something different.

625
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:47,780
What's molt?

626
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,440
To your hand...

627
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,840
To every hand you play.

628
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,140
Be picky.

629
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,280
You can only carry five jokers at a time.

630
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,560
Now buy the other card.

631
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,220
Empress.

632
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,280
Enhance two...

633
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,980
What the fuck is a molt card?

634
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,660
Oh, it's...

635
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,080
Multiply.

636
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,120
Okay.

637
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:11,860
Oh, it means multiply.

638
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:18,770
Okay, I get it.

639
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:20,530
This tarot card is a consumable.

640
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:21,990
This one has your playing cards.

641
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:22,910
Hold on to it.

642
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:25,890
You can carry up to two consumable cards with you at a time.

643
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:28,790
They say enough you can buy a voucher.

644
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,970
Vouchers passively upgrade your run.

645
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:34,490
Vouchers are restocked after you defeat the boss blind.

646
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:35,550
And check out bo...

647
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:37,190
Oh no, not the booster packs.

648
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,470
Oh no, I thought I was done with you.

649
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:40,290
I...

650
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:46,270
I...

651
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:50,170
I thought I was done with you.

652
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:55,570
Oh my god.

653
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:56,170
Okay.

654
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:58,250
Um, they're full of goodies.

655
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:00,790
Let's move on to the next round.

656
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:01,630
Okay.

657
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:03,830
Alright.

658
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:05,190
Alright, let me bring it...

659
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:06,510
Bring up...

660
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:08,470
The game volume.

661
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,070
And then...

662
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:10,270
It's like a...

663
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:13,190
Okay.

664
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:29,910
Oh, okay.

665
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:32,770
So every time I do a play, I just have to throw two cards.

666
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:35,010
Um...

667
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:35,750
Uh...

668
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,910
Welcome to the tomato farm.

669
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:38,890
Welcome, welcome.

670
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:41,070
If you beat it...

671
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:41,730
Then...

672
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:42,010
Uh...

673
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:45,150
The ante goes up and all the blinds become harder.

674
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:47,230
Beat ante 8 to win.

675
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:48,570
Now choose your path.

676
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:49,870
No, I fucking...

677
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:50,590
I ain't no coward.

678
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,110
Alright, let me...

679
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:53,850
Let me...

680
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:54,950
Oh, I can up...

681
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:56,470
Alright, it's already really fast.

682
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,050
Like, I...

683
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:58,410
I just woke up, guys.

684
00:30:58,430 --> 00:30:58,890
I can't...

685
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:01,110
I just...

686
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:01,890
I just...

687
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:02,010
Guys...

688
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:03,450
I just woke up.

689
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:04,150
I...

690
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:04,750
I...

691
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:07,590
I can't do it faster, guys.

692
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:08,910
Like, please.

693
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:09,850
Have mercy.

694
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:10,430
I know.

695
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:10,930
I...

696
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:13,710
I know you guys like it fast.

697
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:14,430
But I...

698
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:17,110
My brain is still adjusting right now.

699
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:21,150
When you get more cards, remember you can rearrange them.

700
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:23,510
Joker triggers in order from left to right.

701
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:25,450
Make sure that you use your consumables.

702
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:26,530
Okay.

703
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:30,690
Slap two cards in hand and press use on a tarot card to enhance them.

704
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:32,110
Wait, but like...

705
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:33,750
What happens when I enhance them?

706
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:36,690
Oh, does it make the points...

707
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:37,890
Does it make the chips higher?

708
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:41,770
Does it make it higher?

709
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:42,970
Is that what it does?

710
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:44,730
I'll just put it on the Js.

711
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,150
Oh, okay.

712
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:48,290
Let's do it.

713
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:50,110
Alright.

714
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,070
What are you?

715
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:53,070
Oh my god.

716
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:54,330
You're J but cooler.

717
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:57,350
The cooler Js.

718
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:57,790
Okay.

719
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:58,970
Alright.

720
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:01,430
We got the cooler Js right here.

721
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:03,550
Um...

722
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:05,130
What do I do with you?

723
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:05,670
What?

724
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:08,650
Two, three, four, five?

725
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:09,670
Wait, what?

726
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:10,410
Oh my gosh.

727
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,270
I already forgot.

728
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:13,730
A three of a kind and a pair.

729
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:14,950
Oh, wait.

730
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,310
Three of a kind and a pair?

731
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:19,190
Wait.

732
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:20,990
Maybe I can do it.

733
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:21,870
Guys.

734
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:24,430
Guys, but like...

735
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:26,310
Two pairs is bad.

736
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:27,490
I could do...

737
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:29,390
Guys.

738
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:30,390
Guys.

739
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:30,970
Guys.

740
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:31,670
Just think.

741
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:33,390
I could get...

742
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:35,210
I could...

743
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:36,390
I could get...

744
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:38,390
I could literally get...

745
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:39,510
Wait.

746
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:42,970
I could literally get three of a kind and a pair, guys.

747
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:44,450
I can...

748
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:46,330
I can get a full house.

749
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:47,350
That's right.

750
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:49,090
Just...

751
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:49,750
Let's go gambling.

752
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:51,390
What's the worst that could happen?

753
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:52,530
I said like yesterday.

754
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:57,370
Did I truly learn what happened to me yesterday?

755
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:58,910
Let's go gambling.

756
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,290
Let's go gambling.

757
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:08,010
You know what?

758
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:10,310
I still have three more discards.

759
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:10,610
Wait.

760
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:11,410
JQueenKing.

761
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:13,670
What's the worst that could happen?

762
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:19,090
What's the worst that could happen, guys?

763
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,670
I mean...

764
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:22,590
Just think about...

765
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,650
3, 4, 5...

766
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,680
3, 4...

767
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:39,930
I got two more.

768
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:40,530
You're right.

769
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:42,230
Gamblers...

770
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:46,730
Gamblers quit at 99% before they hit it.

771
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:48,570
You're so right, guys.

772
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:50,450
You're so fucking right.

773
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,260
Guys, I...

774
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:58,140
Guys, I...

775
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,900
You're right all in.

776
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,160
You're fucking right.

777
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:05,620
What's the

778
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:17,800
worst...

779
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,760
I mean...

780
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,240
It's alright.

781
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:19,940
Two pairs.

782
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,500
I've always wanted to play two pairs.

783
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:30,300
I forgot to play the fifth card.

784
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:31,360
I forgot.

785
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:34,760
We won anyway.

786
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:35,780
It's fine.

787
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,520
We already won.

788
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:43,120
Wait, I could've just won the game in the first fucking play?

789
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,240
I...

790
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,840
Okay.

791
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:47,560
Alright.

792
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,260
I didn't realize that.

793
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,740
I could've just won the game at that.

794
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:53,700
That's right.

795
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:54,320
There you go.

796
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,600
Never punish, guys.

797
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,720
I'll never learn.

798
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:01,840
Oh, but I can buy...

799
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,720
Permanently gain one hand?

800
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:05,040
Wait.

801
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,920
I want a permanent voucher.

802
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,000
Wait.

803
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:08,380
Okay.

804
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,300
I'll get a voucher.

805
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:09,980
Nice.

806
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:10,980
I get one hand.

807
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:12,400
Yeah.

808
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,980
I'll take that.

809
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,520
Victor, thank you for the super chat.

810
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:17,900
Thank you.

811
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:18,560
Thank you.

812
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:21,380
God gave you all these scars for a reason.

813
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,140
Let's go gambling.

814
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,860
Thank you for the super chat.

815
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,360
Thank you.

816
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,200
Thank you.

817
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:26,180
Alright.

818
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,000
Alright.

819
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,440
Now I'm broke, but that's okay.

820
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,140
Next round.

821
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,800
I feel like it's gonna come in handy.

822
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:32,040
I mean, it's like...

823
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,420
Oh, I get to fight the big boss.

824
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:36,960
Alright.

825
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,960
Let's grab two random cards per hand played.

826
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:40,920
Oh, okay.

827
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:41,580
So I have to multi.

828
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:42,900
Five, six...

829
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:43,840
Wait, I have hearts.

830
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,400
Okay, but like...

831
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,600
Oh, but it's random.

832
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:49,260
Right?

833
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,120
Oh.

834
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,800
Wait, it's random.

835
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,860
Oh, this is bad.

836
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,800
It's the same rank that we played.

837
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,040
Oh, I need like...

838
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:02,380
Oh.

839
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,060
Oh, it's random.

840
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:08,500
It's...

841
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,340
Played, not discard.

842
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:11,820
Oh, it's not discarded.

843
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,080
So I can still gamble.

844
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,860
Okay, I don't need any...

845
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:15,680
I don't need these.

846
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:16,560
Okay.

847
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,360
We might be able to get another heart.

848
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,280
And then we'll do like four or five...

849
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,180
Yeah, I can get another heart from this.

850
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,540
One, two...

851
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,360
Okay.

852
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,620
I can still get another heart, guys.

853
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,780
Guys, I can...

854
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:33,080
One, two, three, four...

855
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:33,940
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

856
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,700
One, two, three, four, five!

857
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:36,740
Wait, I got it!

858
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:37,800
I got flesh!

859
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:43,070
I'm sorry, I have to count right again.

860
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:43,950
I'm worried.

861
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:44,770
I'm...

862
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:46,270
I'm worried I can't count.

863
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:47,370
I'm...

864
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:48,350
I'm worried.

865
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:49,890
Oh my God, I kept my G!

866
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:50,990
Let's fucking go!

867
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:53,190
Did I win?

868
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:55,490
Wait, this... Wait.

869
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:56,730
Did I win?

870
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:58,730
Oh no, I need a hundred more.

871
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:00,190
Okay.

872
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:03,570
Two, two...

873
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:06,190
Wait, I can just do two pairs and then I win.

874
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:08,850
Fucking, this game is for babies.

875
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:11,810
Wait.

876
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:14,550
If I just do two pairs, I literally just win.

877
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:18,930
Wait, is this game supposed to be hard?

878
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,060
I got the multiplayer.

879
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:27,680
440...

880
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,040
Yeah!

881
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,980
This game is for fucking babies.

882
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,380
You know what?

883
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,200
Maybe gambling ain't so bad.

884
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,560
Hello, Casino.

885
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:39,070
Would you...

886
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,000
Okay.

887
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,560
Brunei, thank you for the super chat.

888
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,840
Thank you, thank you.

889
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:55,720
I swear to God, every V2 I watched that tried Ballaltro for the first time always succeeded on two pairs.

890
00:37:55,980 --> 00:38:00,020
You either go big or go home, Brunei.

891
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,460
I ain't no pussy.

892
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:04,380
We gotta go for the top scores.

893
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,600
We're not here to play safe.

894
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:12,420
Alright.

895
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:18,540
Choose one of up to three playing cards to add to your deck.

896
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,540
Wait, do I buy...

897
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,100
That's my gambling stream.

898
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:26,880
Yeah.

899
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,320
Top scores, please.

900
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,600
Look, I guaranteed the win.

901
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,860
I was fine.

902
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,560
Let's see.

903
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,500
Oh, what's this?

904
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,840
The Joker gains for each card sold.

905
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:44,020
Resets when boss blind is defeated.

906
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,000
What about buying the Joker card?

907
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:47,860
Bus Joker.

908
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,720
The Joker gains plus one multiplier per consecutive hand played.

909
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,560
Wait, that's insane.

910
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,780
It's ass?

911
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,720
The bus sounds like it's gonna be crazy.

912
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,180
Alright, I'm ready.

913
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,300
Next round.

914
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,040
Alright.

915
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,660
I'm ready for the tiny one.

916
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:08,680
Are we still in tutorial?

917
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:09,940
Wait.

918
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:11,520
One, two, three.

919
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:12,020
Wait.

920
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,320
We almost have...

921
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,060
Four cards.

922
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:17,600
Wait, four of a kind.

923
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,540
Oh my God, let's go gambling.

924
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,300
Wait, wait.

925
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:21,900
One, two, three.

926
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:22,560
Oh, fuck.

927
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:22,840
Wait.

928
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,320
Okay, if I get rid of...

929
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,840
Okay, I'm gonna get rid of...

930
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,240
I don't need this.

931
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,840
I don't need this, cause...

932
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,440
Wait, I...

933
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,020
I could get...

934
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,440
I'll get another full...

935
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,520
Wait, I could get three, two...

936
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,000
Wait, you're right.

937
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:41,960
Three, two...

938
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:42,440
Wait, you're right.

939
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,020
I could get a full house.

940
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:45,760
Okay.

941
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:47,880
I got a full house easily.

942
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:49,940
Plus five, plus five.

943
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:51,880
Three, two...

944
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,940
Oh my God, I'm learning how to gamble, guys.

945
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,620
So, what's like the bad thing...

946
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,300
Oh, no wonder they try to warn me against gambling.

947
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,900
They're trying to make sure I don't have a good time.

948
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,740
Oh, I got another heart.

949
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,400
That's easy.

950
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,380
Got another heart.

951
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:15,440
Another flush.

952
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:16,940
Did I win?

953
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:18,920
Plus two.

954
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,260
I rode the bus.

955
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,360
Speed up the animation.

956
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:27,900
Nice.

957
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:28,360
Alright.

958
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,600
Just don't stop the bus.

959
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:33,160
Wait, is ace not a face card?

960
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,280
Wait, what does that mean?

961
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,680
Got cash out.

962
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,160
Can I afford this now?

963
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,720
No, I'm still broke.

964
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,620
Oh, if played...

965
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:48,260
Plus twelve, mult if played, hand contains a straight.

966
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,400
Plus five...

967
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,720
Wait, isn't this good?

968
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:00,990
Isn't this good?

969
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:01,670
No?

970
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:03,270
It's okay.

971
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:05,930
Straight busted.

972
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:07,810
Thank you for the super chat.

973
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:08,230
Thank you.

974
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:11,090
Straight bad.

975
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:14,950
Okay, plus five hand sight reduces by one every round.

976
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:16,590
What?

977
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:18,150
Save money?

978
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:19,550
Okay, I'll save my money.

979
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:20,790
Situational?

980
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:22,510
Alright, I'll save my money then.

981
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:25,370
I'll save my money for the big boys.

982
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:31,370
J, king, one, two, two, four...

983
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:32,570
What do I want to get?

984
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:35,710
I could get...

985
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:42,600
One, two, three...

986
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:46,470
Two...

987
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:48,230
I need to discard some stuff.

988
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:50,370
I'm gonna discard these.

989
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:53,770
I'm gonna discard...

990
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:57,030
I feel like I don't really need these.

991
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:04,770
I feel like...

992
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:09,570
Do I discard the face cards?

993
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:11,690
But like, plus ten!

994
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:15,490
Oh, my face cards are bad now?

995
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:16,450
They stopped the...

996
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:20,770
Sorry, the joker didn't play without scoring?

997
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:21,210
Okay.

998
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:23,210
Alright, we discard...

999
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:24,210
We'll discard the...

1000
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:26,510
We'll ride the bus.

1001
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:27,930
We'll take public transportation.

1002
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:29,310
Oh!

1003
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:31,910
Wait!

1004
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:34,990
I have three!

1005
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:44,980
I have three of a kind!

1006
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:45,760
I just need two!

1007
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,600
Do I use three of a kind now or should I...

1008
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,980
I could use three of a kind now...

1009
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,060
And then get...

1010
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:55,020
Or do I risk it?

1011
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,580
I'm gonna pull for full house.

1012
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,620
Yeah, I'm gonna pull for full house.

1013
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,760
I'm gonna pull for it.

1014
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,360
I'm gonna do it.

1015
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:09,120
Let's go gambling.

1016
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:12,940
Okay, I shouldn't have gone gambling, guys.

1017
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:13,600
Alright.

1018
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,080
Okay.

1019
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,880
I'm so mad!

1020
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,200
Alright.

1021
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:30,460
Alright.

1022
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,020
I'll leave.

1023
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:33,640
I'll put...

1024
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:34,420
I'll discard three.

1025
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:37,020
It's okay.

1026
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:38,000
I have two more discards.

1027
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:39,060
Oh, let's go!

1028
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:47,010
Let's fucking go!

1029
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:50,950
I got the plus three multiplier!

1030
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:53,210
Alright.

1031
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:55,030
Okay.

1032
00:43:56,230 --> 00:43:58,490
Okay, this is getting a little difficult now.

1033
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:02,570
I got a pair...

1034
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:04,690
And then nothing else.

1035
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:06,790
I have one more discard.

1036
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:09,510
I mean, I could just play the threes for now.

1037
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:10,770
Right?

1038
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:14,290
I have a pair.

1039
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:16,750
I might as well just pull a pair now.

1040
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:18,370
And then, can I...

1041
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:18,810
A pair?

1042
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:23,030
If I play with other cards...

1043
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:25,250
Should I just play the pair now?

1044
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:26,590
And then...

1045
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:26,990
I do...

1046
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:27,250
Oh, wait.

1047
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:28,610
I have double pairs.

1048
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:30,490
So, I have two pairs.

1049
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:33,570
Can I put a discard in?

1050
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:34,650
Or does it really matter?

1051
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:35,430
Chat.

1052
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:37,690
Does it really matter if I have a discard in?

1053
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:39,430
Or can I just put...

1054
00:44:39,430 --> 00:44:40,570
Like, should I do it?

1055
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:41,670
I don't know if I should.

1056
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,080
Go for Ace's full house?

1057
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:48,800
Guys.

1058
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:50,380
Okay.

1059
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:51,340
Wait.

1060
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:52,660
I could...

1061
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:54,000
I have one more...

1062
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,520
I do...

1063
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,460
I do have...

1064
00:44:58,460 --> 00:44:59,020
You're right.

1065
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,460
I have one more discard.

1066
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:02,340
You're so right, guys.

1067
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:03,980
I don't need all these other cards.

1068
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:04,860
I...

1069
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:11,560
You're so right, guys.

1070
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,880
Who needs these other cards?

1071
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:15,420
Okay.

1072
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:19,460
Alright.

1073
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,140
I guess...

1074
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,920
I guess I play this.

1075
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:28,620
Aw, dang it.

1076
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:31,700
I got the multiplier.

1077
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:32,380
Is that enough?

1078
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:33,560
Oh, no.

1079
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:34,520
Oh, no.

1080
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:35,420
I need 200 more.

1081
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:36,300
Oh!

1082
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:37,420
Okay, I have a pair.

1083
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,300
I think that's fine.

1084
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:43,360
I think that's fine.

1085
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:46,240
4, 5, 6, 7...

1086
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:46,480
Wait!

1087
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,040
4, 5, 6, 7...

1088
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:49,580
Okay, wait.

1089
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:50,880
Can I...

1090
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:51,820
Flush...

1091
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:52,720
4, 5...

1092
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:53,460
5 cards...

1093
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:54,360
Take it straight.

1094
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:56,180
5 cards in a row.

1095
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:57,860
Okay, that's not really it.

1096
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:58,760
Okay, wait.

1097
00:45:58,840 --> 00:45:58,980
Wait.

1098
00:45:59,060 --> 00:45:59,140
Wait.

1099
00:45:59,200 --> 00:45:59,260
Wait.

1100
00:45:59,260 --> 00:45:59,380
I can do it.

1101
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,680
I can do a pair.

1102
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:02,960
I'll just do a pair now.

1103
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,560
And then...

1104
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:09,920
Yeah, I don't need much anyway, guys.

1105
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:10,960
I don't need much.

1106
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:12,140
So...

1107
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:13,140
So, it's fine.

1108
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:15,940
I believe in the bus.

1109
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,300
That should be it, right?

1110
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,460
I got the multiplier.

1111
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:24,420
I'm riding the bus.

1112
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:25,120
Yeah!

1113
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:25,920
I did it!

1114
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,340
God, this is such an easy game.

1115
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:28,440
Oh, my God.

1116
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,520
Ring Ring Casino?

1117
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:32,640
I'm ready to count my cards.

1118
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,080
I'm ready to start counting cards.

1119
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:35,820
Anton, thank you for the super chat.

1120
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:36,700
Thank you, thank you.

1121
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:38,700
Campbell responsibly.

1122
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:41,240
Brought to you by Doki Steak.

1123
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:42,680
Thank you for the super chat.

1124
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:43,100
Thank you.

1125
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:44,480
Thank you, Anton.

1126
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:46,220
All right.

1127
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:46,980
Cash out.

1128
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:49,760
All right.

1129
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:51,380
This is how they hook me in.

1130
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:52,220
This is it.

1131
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:54,060
Permanently gained plus one discard.

1132
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,520
Wait, should I buy a voucher?

1133
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,080
I feel like Doki just got a...

1134
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,160
Marco Rivals, please.

1135
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:00,500
Don't get a discount.

1136
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,760
Thank you for the super chat.

1137
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:06,360
Thank you.

1138
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:07,600
Thank you.

1139
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:09,400
Wait, is red card bad?

1140
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:10,900
Oh, wait.

1141
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:11,820
It's red.

1142
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:13,660
Red is always good.

1143
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:19,020
But guys, it's red.

1144
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:23,280
Red is extra special.

1145
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:28,820
For each remaining card in deck currently...

1146
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:29,160
Wait!

1147
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:30,480
Wait!

1148
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,480
How many cards do I have?

1149
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:32,880
I have 52 cards.

1150
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:33,640
Read.

1151
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:38,820
I like how I'm like, guys, I'm not going to read what it does, but it's red.

1152
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:47,140
This joker gains plus three when any booster pack is skipped.

1153
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:49,700
We have more skipping booster packs, so I should get this.

1154
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:52,240
Read.

1155
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:57,120
Mega, choose two of up to four Spectro cards.

1156
00:47:57,180 --> 00:47:58,120
What's a Spectro card?

1157
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,320
Oh, the Spectro cards are OP?

1158
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:03,620
Say enough.

1159
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:04,300
Say enough.

1160
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:05,120
Alright.

1161
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:13,240
Destroy one random card in your hand and add two random enhanced aces to your cards.

1162
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:14,740
What the fuck?

1163
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:18,120
Add foil holographic or...

1164
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:22,520
Or polychrome effect to one selected card.

1165
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,260
Add polychrome to a random joker.

1166
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:29,120
Destroyers converts all hands into a single random rank.

1167
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:30,260
Minus one.

1168
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:33,400
I feel like aura seems like...

1169
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,420
Or the aces?

1170
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:38,220
Aces and...

1171
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:42,240
You can add two.

1172
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:43,160
Add poly...

1173
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:45,160
I only have one joker anyway, right?

1174
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:46,840
Oh no, I have two jokers!

1175
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:53,760
Ouija or hex converts all cards to a single random rank.

1176
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:57,560
Destroy ace cards for aces.

1177
00:48:57,660 --> 00:48:59,000
I feel like this...

1178
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,780
Shouldn't grim be better?

1179
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:02,900
Polychrome?

1180
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:04,440
And destroy...

1181
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:05,300
But...

1182
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:07,200
Rathabus though!

1183
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:09,880
But what if it destroys Rathabus?

1184
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,260
It's just a random...

1185
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:15,360
It's just a random card joker!

1186
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,980
What if it destroys Rathabus?

1187
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:23,980
How do I sell it?

1188
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:27,460
Is this Jimbo?

1189
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:29,120
They have names?

1190
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:32,220
Who the fuck is Jimbo?

1191
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:38,680
Oh, is he Jimbo?

1192
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:40,420
His name is Joker.

1193
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:43,820
Goodbye, Joker.

1194
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:46,060
Okay, grim and hex.

1195
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:48,580
Wait, I said two, right?

1196
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:49,780
Okay, I'll do hex.

1197
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:55,160
Oh my god, now you're rainbow!

1198
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:56,620
And then ace.

1199
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:01,370
Goodbye, Jimbo.

1200
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:04,390
Wait, and then...

1201
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:05,770
Wait, is Ouija better?

1202
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:08,750
Converts all cards...

1203
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:11,690
Should I get the Ouija or...

1204
00:50:11,690 --> 00:50:12,650
Ouija.

1205
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:15,530
Converts all cards in hands to a...

1206
00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:17,370
You know I love gambling.

1207
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:19,290
Alright.

1208
00:50:20,910 --> 00:50:21,430
Alright.

1209
00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:21,970
Woah.

1210
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:24,990
That's a lot of sevens.

1211
00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:25,810
Alright.

1212
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:30,350
Alright, I'm good to go.

1213
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:33,110
You are now...

1214
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:35,070
Oh, is all my cards just sevens now?

1215
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:37,430
Oh my god, lucky seven!

1216
00:50:37,770 --> 00:50:38,690
Okay, I'm gonna save my money.

1217
00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:41,190
Alright, the window.

1218
00:50:41,490 --> 00:50:43,030
All diamond cards are debuffed.

1219
00:50:43,230 --> 00:50:43,550
Okay.

1220
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:49,080
Where's my sevens?

1221
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:58,720
Scores no chips, so I'll just get rid of the diamonds then.

1222
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,960
Yeah, I'll just get rid of the diamonds.

1223
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:04,420
Oh, you're right!

1224
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:07,160
What if I discard everything until I get sevens?

1225
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:09,900
Oh, you're right!

1226
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:11,280
Let's go gambling.

1227
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:13,680
Oh my god!

1228
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:15,300
Let's go.

1229
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,620
Go for all sevens, you're so right.

1230
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,540
Two... Oh my god!

1231
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:24,640
Bam, I'm done.

1232
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:30,460
I won.

1233
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:32,660
I won the game.

1234
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,700
Holy shit!

1235
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:36,900
155.

1236
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,900
The boss, let's go!

1237
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:45,980
Five of a kind.

1238
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:47,560
She's cheating.

1239
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,080
She's counting cards!

1240
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,880
Not so deadpool, thank you for the super chat.

1241
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:52,780
Thank you, thank you.

1242
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:54,660
You can do variety streams on YouTube.

1243
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:59,000
Marble Rivals, Hot Twitch, and silly gambling games on Geek.

1244
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:01,200
The triple threat.

1245
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:04,540
Alright, see you guys on Geek for Poloctro.

1246
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,280
Thank you for the super chat.

1247
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:08,600
Not so deadpool, thank you, thank you.

1248
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:09,320
Alright.

1249
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:12,700
Wait, I got another spectral pack!

1250
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:15,780
Wait, I got Voucher.

1251
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,220
Appear more frequently.

1252
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:18,760
Okay, wait, I got...

1253
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,180
I have 18 dollars.

1254
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:21,640
DNA?

1255
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:29,180
If first hand of round has only one card, add a permanent copy to the deck and draw it to hand.

1256
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:30,160
Alright.

1257
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:33,860
What's this?

1258
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:37,140
If first hand of round is a single six, destroy and create...

1259
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:39,480
Wait, I can create a spectral card!

1260
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,180
Is that good?

1261
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,900
I can get more sevens!

1262
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:46,220
I can...

1263
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:51,840
Oh my god.

1264
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:53,820
We're here for the seven.

1265
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:54,940
Oh, it's bad.

1266
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:57,880
Should I buy another spectral pack?

1267
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,080
Celestia is better?

1268
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:02,080
Oh my god.

1269
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,680
I can make more sevens.

1270
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:06,080
Play one seven first round every time.

1271
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:08,120
Oh my god, you're so right.

1272
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:10,660
I can just...

1273
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:12,920
I can just play sevens.

1274
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:16,460
And then my entire deck will just be sevens.

1275
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:19,040
Oh my god, you're so right.

1276
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:23,540
I'll just...

1277
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:26,240
I'll just keep having...

1278
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:29,180
Convert all cards in hand to a single random suit.

1279
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:32,020
Add a purple seal to one selected card.

1280
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:32,800
What's a perk?

1281
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:35,160
Creates a terror card when discarded.

1282
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:36,920
Converts all...

1283
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:38,560
Wait, okay.

1284
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,940
If I...

1285
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:42,940
If I do...

1286
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:44,940
If I do...

1287
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,840
Okay, I'm gaming now.

1288
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:53,140
You play the pokies on stream one day?

1289
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:56,000
Okay, medium.

1290
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:57,860
Wait, how do I...

1291
00:53:57,860 --> 00:53:58,600
What card do I put?

1292
00:53:58,620 --> 00:53:59,400
Do I put it on seven?

1293
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,300
Do I get purple seven?

1294
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:04,020
But which seven?

1295
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:06,720
Put the seal on the king?

1296
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:08,500
But I got to ride the bus!

1297
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:10,420
If I...

1298
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:12,140
I can't use face cards, guys!

1299
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:14,440
I can't...

1300
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:17,660
I can't use...

1301
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:19,060
Wait, is that okay?

1302
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:20,400
Oh, but it discards, right?

1303
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:22,120
Oh, it discarded!

1304
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:25,340
Okay, alright.

1305
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:26,520
Are meant to be discarded.

1306
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:27,660
Okay, I'll put it on the king.

1307
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,080
Alright, there you go.

1308
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:32,820
Because I have to discard the king, right?

1309
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,660
Alright, and then we can buy a celestial pack too.

1310
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:37,140
Because we're rich as fuck.

1311
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:38,100
Alright.

1312
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,240
Low up four of a kind.

1313
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:44,040
Low up straight flush.

1314
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:45,440
What's a straight... I'm sorry, I still...

1315
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:46,840
I keep forgetting what...

1316
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,240
Wait, four of a kind!

1317
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:50,680
Low up full house.

1318
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:51,800
What was full house again?

1319
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:52,440
Guys?

1320
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:53,180
Wait!

1321
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:55,640
I get four of a kind!

1322
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:56,640
Of sevens!

1323
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:57,440
You're right!

1324
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,740
All I just... All I need is seven!

1325
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:03,580
Okay, this is a seven run.

1326
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:05,780
This is actually the seven.

1327
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:06,800
Alright, I'm ready.

1328
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:09,600
I'm fucking ready for the run of the seven.

1329
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:11,040
Alright.

1330
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:12,600
I'll play this.

1331
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:14,540
Has only one card.

1332
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:15,180
Add a permanent...

1333
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:17,960
Okay, if I do this, it'll always be in my deck, right?

1334
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,460
Seven, seven, Gamma.

1335
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:24,200
Alright.

1336
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:27,120
Seven.

1337
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:31,200
Oh my god, it's in my deck.

1338
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:32,680
Oh my god.

1339
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:34,640
Easy $144.

1340
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:36,900
Alright, I'm gonna get rid of all these guys.

1341
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:37,880
I don't need you.

1342
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:39,580
I don't fuck you.

1343
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:40,560
Or I could just...

1344
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:43,140
I could get rid of all of these and just get sevens.

1345
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,140
Okay, I'll get rid of the five because I don't need the five.

1346
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:46,280
And then...

1347
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:51,240
All I need is just... I'll get rid of the six too because who needs... You don't get rid of all of you guys.

1348
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:52,920
I just need sevens.

1349
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:55,940
The moment I get sevens, I win.

1350
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:56,620
Alright, goodbye.

1351
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:56,920
Goodbye.

1352
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:04,560
I just need one card.

1353
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,500
And it's the sevens.

1354
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:09,060
I still... Guys, there's still hope.

1355
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,520
There's still hope.

1356
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,320
Alright, let's go.

1357
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:13,000
All in.

1358
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:17,960
And not seven.

1359
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:19,100
I discard.

1360
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:20,860
All in.

1361
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,700
Let's go.

1362
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:25,180
Let's go.

1363
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:27,640
Actual Exodia deck.

1364
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:31,060
Oh, my easiest game of my life.

1365
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,940
Oh, my God.

1366
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:38,540
Alright, cash up.

1367
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:40,520
Alright.

1368
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:43,400
It's time for the sevens.

1369
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:45,580
Thank you for the Akasupa.

1370
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:46,780
Thank you, thank you.

1371
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:48,960
Thank you for the super chat.

1372
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:50,280
Thank you, thank you.

1373
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:53,980
I can't believe your first run is the most pilatro run.

1374
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:54,880
Wait.

1375
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,320
What do you mean negative?

1376
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,000
No money?

1377
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:04,980
Negative jokers are free?

1378
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:09,460
I broke the game?

1379
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,300
I can't afford it?

1380
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:12,700
No!

1381
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,000
No!

1382
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:18,500
Why did I buy the celestial pack?

1383
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:19,700
Why?

1384
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:20,480
No!

1385
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:24,500
Wait, if I sell DNA...

1386
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:29,980
Guys, do I do it?

1387
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:31,760
Do I sell DNA?

1388
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:33,060
Do I?

1389
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:35,420
No, don't.

1390
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,960
Guys, I don't need DNA.

1391
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:40,080
Do not.

1392
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:46,440
But, plus two chips for each remaining card in deck.

1393
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:48,480
No, I need a five.

1394
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:50,320
DNA is much better.

1395
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,120
I'll see you again.

1396
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:53,460
Don't worry.

1397
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:55,340
I'll see you again.

1398
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:58,140
I'll see you again, don't worry.

1399
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:59,960
Alright, here we go again.

1400
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:01,820
Here we go.

1401
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:05,240
Here we go again.

1402
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:07,940
Wait, I got four of a kind.

1403
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:09,060
Is it four of a kind?

1404
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:10,980
I forgot.

1405
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:12,360
I forgot to do a single seven.

1406
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:14,440
No, I forgot to do a single seven.

1407
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:15,080
Wait, no!

1408
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,520
Can I still do it?

1409
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,880
Can I still play that one seven?

1410
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:24,220
Oh, I can.

1411
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:25,340
Oh, good.

1412
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:25,680
Alright.

1413
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,180
I'll clone this one.

1414
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:30,180
Okay.

1415
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:32,060
I'm gonna clone this one.

1416
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:34,120
Alright.

1417
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:35,220
Nice.

1418
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:36,640
I got another seven.

1419
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:40,100
Okay, do I...

1420
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:42,440
Okay, do I...

1421
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:43,280
Should I do the full?

1422
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:45,760
Should I do the full?

1423
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:48,320
I do have four of a kind multiplier.

1424
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:50,640
I don't remember the four of a kind multiplier.

1425
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:53,700
Or should I do fives?

1426
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:55,960
Just for five of a kind.

1427
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,180
Try four of a kind.

1428
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:01,680
Okay, four of a kind is better.

1429
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:02,380
Okay.

1430
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:06,640
Check run info.

1431
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:09,680
But I have the four of a kind level two.

1432
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,680
Oh, but it's 120x12.

1433
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:15,200
Wait, that's bigger numbers.

1434
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:16,060
You're right.

1435
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:18,400
The numbers are bigger.

1436
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:22,380
You're right.

1437
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:25,820
You're right, I still have hope.

1438
00:59:28,180 --> 00:59:29,340
Wait, discard.

1439
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:31,460
Creates a random...

1440
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:33,160
Oh, but that's too huge.

1441
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:34,940
Can I...

1442
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:35,820
Oh, no.

1443
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:37,260
Oh, no.

1444
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:38,480
This is so risky.

1445
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:41,180
This is so risky.

1446
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:43,960
Come on.

1447
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:47,680
I got...

1448
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,820
Oh, my...

1449
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:56,320
Let's go gambling!

1450
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:02,140
Let's go gambling!

1451
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:08,360
What the fuck is...

1452
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:10,320
What the fuck is this?

1453
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:12,720
Holy shit.

1454
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:13,480
Okay.

1455
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:17,300
Let's play this one.

1456
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:20,540
Oh, my God.

1457
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:23,380
Even better.

1458
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:26,660
Alright.

1459
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:28,560
Yeah, guys, you think I won?

1460
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:31,380
Seven sevens.

1461
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:32,520
I'm a natural.

1462
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:33,940
Casinos, watch out.

1463
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:36,560
Don't keep...

1464
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:39,920
It's gonna be banned from all casinos from here on out.

1465
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:40,940
Alright.

1466
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:43,480
How about Flush 5?

1467
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:44,720
Wait, Flush 5?

1468
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:45,080
Wait!

1469
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:48,420
This is so good!

1470
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,140
Oh, my God.

1471
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:52,120
I'll sell the tower.

1472
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:54,760
I'll sell the tower.

1473
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:57,560
And then, let me get...

1474
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:00,120
Let me get Flush 5.

1475
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,000
Wait, do I do buy and use?

1476
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:03,380
Buy and...

1477
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:05,400
What's the difference between buy and use?

1478
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:09,460
No, just...

1479
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:10,640
Buy and use, right?

1480
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,540
Okay, buy and use.

1481
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:14,280
Let's fucking go!

1482
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:17,320
Alright.

1483
01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:21,660
One in two chances to get a tower caught when any booster pack is open.

1484
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:23,020
Oh, no.

1485
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:25,500
If I get that, should I save my money?

1486
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:27,540
Uh, let's see.

1487
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:28,200
Always caught.

1488
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:29,820
What a silly run.

1489
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:30,700
What?

1490
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:33,300
Why is she...

1491
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:35,140
Okay, buy Mega Arcane.

1492
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:37,880
Is Mega Arcane actually worth it?

1493
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:38,880
Save?

1494
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:39,680
I don't know.

1495
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:40,900
Is it worth it?

1496
01:01:41,020 --> 01:01:42,700
This is my first run.

1497
01:01:43,180 --> 01:01:45,640
What do you mean?

1498
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:47,600
It's just sevens!

1499
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:50,080
I just...

1500
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:52,220
Okay, next round.

1501
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:53,540
I'm just trying...

1502
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:55,260
I'm just doing sevens.

1503
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:56,940
I don't know what you...

1504
01:01:56,940 --> 01:01:57,380
Alright.

1505
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,720
Wait, I'll just put this one now.

1506
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:02,700
I can clone it now.

1507
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:04,820
I'll clone it now, actually.

1508
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:07,060
Uh...

1509
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:09,560
Uh...

1510
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:10,000
No?

1511
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:15,400
It's over?

1512
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:17,340
Why?

1513
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:20,740
Wait, what?

1514
01:02:22,020 --> 01:02:23,280
How is it over?

1515
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:24,520
Why?

1516
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:27,100
There's no heart.

1517
01:02:27,220 --> 01:02:28,120
There's no seven.

1518
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:30,260
Clone hearts?

1519
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:31,700
There's no hearts!

1520
01:02:35,970 --> 01:02:37,270
Hearts are debuffed?

1521
01:02:37,550 --> 01:02:37,830
Oh.

1522
01:02:39,090 --> 01:02:40,490
Heart cards are debuffed.

1523
01:02:40,650 --> 01:02:41,310
Oh, okay.

1524
01:02:41,830 --> 01:02:42,870
Okay, we'll clone this.

1525
01:02:44,110 --> 01:02:46,070
I got the clubs now.

1526
01:02:46,730 --> 01:02:47,110
Alright.

1527
01:02:50,430 --> 01:02:52,870
Although all my sevens are hearts, you're right.

1528
01:02:52,870 --> 01:02:54,510
It's possible.

1529
01:02:54,810 --> 01:02:55,710
We're fine.

1530
01:02:56,390 --> 01:02:56,870
Discard.

1531
01:02:58,610 --> 01:02:59,030
Okay.

1532
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:03,570
Discard.

1533
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:08,290
It's not over yet.

1534
01:03:09,730 --> 01:03:11,310
One, two, three, four.

1535
01:03:13,550 --> 01:03:14,130
Discard.

1536
01:03:15,010 --> 01:03:16,270
Guys, we're...

1537
01:03:16,270 --> 01:03:16,910
Oh no.

1538
01:03:17,630 --> 01:03:18,630
It's my...

1539
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:20,790
It's my last discard, guys.

1540
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:28,220
It's my last one.

1541
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:30,160
Oh

1542
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:35,960
no.

1543
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:37,160
Okay.

1544
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:40,660
Okay.

1545
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:41,820
Plus seven.

1546
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:42,900
Plus seven.

1547
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:46,260
Twenty -four.

1548
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:47,500
Thirty-six.

1549
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:49,260
Five thousand!

1550
01:03:50,380 --> 01:03:52,640
I made it!

1551
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:55,300
I actually...

1552
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:56,000
Ah, see?

1553
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:57,840
No losses yet.

1554
01:03:58,560 --> 01:03:59,960
We're cleared.

1555
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:02,140
We're so back.

1556
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:04,160
Oh my god.

1557
01:04:04,460 --> 01:04:05,860
It is the...

1558
01:04:05,860 --> 01:04:07,620
It is the seven run.

1559
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:09,440
Oh my god.

1560
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:11,240
The run of the seven.

1561
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:15,520
Wait.

1562
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:16,260
What is this?

1563
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:19,020
Retriggered all play cards and final hand a round?

1564
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:21,700
Wait, I can get so many sevens!

1565
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:23,520
Wait, plus one hand size!

1566
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:26,360
Wait, I can get so many.

1567
01:04:27,220 --> 01:04:28,580
Wait, get the voucher.

1568
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:29,180
You're right, you're right.

1569
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:30,280
Another hand.

1570
01:04:30,860 --> 01:04:32,400
Oh my god.

1571
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:35,840
But imagine how many sevens I could get.

1572
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:44,080
Imagine if I had this Joker.

1573
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:48,560
Just how many sevens I could use.

1574
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:52,420
Choose up to...

1575
01:04:52,420 --> 01:04:53,560
Oh, I don't know.

1576
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,200
These are regular booster packs.

1577
01:04:55,380 --> 01:05:02,860
I feel like regular booster packs is possibly...

1578
01:05:02,860 --> 01:05:05,060
Yeah, I'm gonna save my money.

1579
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:08,380
You could get a seven.

1580
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:11,180
Look for a seven there.

1581
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:15,620
Yeah, but then...

1582
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:16,800
My money.

1583
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,280
I could save my money though.

1584
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:20,620
Guys.

1585
01:05:20,620 --> 01:05:21,120
Guys.

1586
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:24,440
The booster pack can contain a seven.

1587
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:25,300
You're so right.

1588
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:28,180
Oh, never mind.

1589
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:30,520
Never mind.

1590
01:05:32,540 --> 01:05:33,260
Skip.

1591
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:35,080
Next round.

1592
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:36,960
It's not a seven.

1593
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:37,960
We don't want that.

1594
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:42,460
How do I have no sevens?

1595
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:44,440
That's absolutely crazy.

1596
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:47,040
I got zero sevens.

1597
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:48,540
That's so fucking crazy.

1598
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:50,320
Oh, my God.

1599
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:51,080
Okay.

1600
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:53,280
Oh, no.

1601
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:54,140
Oh, no.

1602
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:55,480
Guys, this is looking grim.

1603
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:56,660
Oh, wait.

1604
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:59,840
Okay, we're gonna... Do I clone the hearts or the spades?

1605
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:01,840
I know I cloned a lot of other sevens.

1606
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:02,880
Like, which...

1607
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:05,960
Which seven should I clone?

1608
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:07,260
Clone seven of hearts?

1609
01:06:07,780 --> 01:06:08,540
Hearts, okay.

1610
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:10,960
Play hand.

1611
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:14,540
Yay, I got another seven.

1612
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:18,280
Yay!

1613
01:06:19,660 --> 01:06:20,940
More sevens!

1614
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:22,740
Okay, and then we get rid of everything else.

1615
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:24,760
Alright.

1616
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:25,760
Discard.

1617
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:29,320
Guys, this is not looking so great.

1618
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:30,080
Guys.

1619
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:32,840
Guys, I'm a little worried.

1620
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:34,720
I only have three sevens, guys.

1621
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:38,100
I'm...

1622
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:39,600
I'm a little worried.

1623
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:42,260
Okay.

1624
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:44,180
My last one.

1625
01:06:46,060 --> 01:06:47,300
Come on.

1626
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:47,820
Come on, baby.

1627
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:49,720
Get me that...

1628
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:50,580
No!

1629
01:06:54,290 --> 01:06:55,310
Okay, that's fine.

1630
01:06:55,610 --> 01:06:56,650
That's fine.

1631
01:06:57,670 --> 01:06:59,010
That's fine.

1632
01:07:00,370 --> 01:07:02,070
We can have four sevens.

1633
01:07:02,730 --> 01:07:03,630
Do I win with four?

1634
01:07:04,110 --> 01:07:06,550
Plus seven, plus seven, plus seven.

1635
01:07:07,370 --> 01:07:08,130
X24.

1636
01:07:08,470 --> 01:07:09,230
X36.

1637
01:07:10,290 --> 01:07:10,870
4000.

1638
01:07:11,410 --> 01:07:13,630
Oh, this is so risky.

1639
01:07:13,630 --> 01:07:16,130
No, and then it gives me a seven!

1640
01:07:17,630 --> 01:07:18,390
Oh,

1641
01:07:22,010 --> 01:07:22,190
no.

1642
01:07:22,570 --> 01:07:23,630
Oh, no.

1643
01:07:24,850 --> 01:07:25,530
Oh.

1644
01:07:26,650 --> 01:07:27,670
I'll just play off.

1645
01:07:27,770 --> 01:07:28,490
Oh, no.

1646
01:07:28,610 --> 01:07:29,030
Wait.

1647
01:07:29,450 --> 01:07:31,970
Not like this.

1648
01:07:32,710 --> 01:07:33,450
Five, six.

1649
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:36,210
But I lose my bus.

1650
01:07:37,330 --> 01:07:38,370
Try two pairs.

1651
01:07:39,630 --> 01:07:40,330
Oh, no.

1652
01:07:40,330 --> 01:07:40,470
Oh.

1653
01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:42,690
I'll run the pair.

1654
01:07:45,750 --> 01:07:48,270
Play your junk cards to fish for more sevens.

1655
01:07:48,610 --> 01:07:49,090
You're right.

1656
01:07:49,910 --> 01:07:51,270
I'll do pairs.

1657
01:07:51,930 --> 01:07:53,230
And then five twos.

1658
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:55,090
Okay, okay.

1659
01:07:55,130 --> 01:07:55,730
We'll do this.

1660
01:07:56,930 --> 01:07:58,230
I need to keep that seven.

1661
01:07:58,510 --> 01:08:00,550
I need to keep the seven.

1662
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:03,290
No, if I do this, I lose my bus.

1663
01:08:03,890 --> 01:08:05,010
We need the bus.

1664
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:09,090
Wait, does the face doesn't count?

1665
01:08:09,410 --> 01:08:10,290
No, it does!

1666
01:08:10,430 --> 01:08:11,110
Doesn't it count?

1667
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:17,540
It won't trigger if I place this?

1668
01:08:21,580 --> 01:08:22,560
Oh, it counts.

1669
01:08:22,660 --> 01:08:22,920
Okay.

1670
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:24,200
Okay, it counts.

1671
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:25,100
Alright, we'll do this.

1672
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:28,540
Oh, okay.

1673
01:08:29,220 --> 01:08:30,100
I'm gonna do this.

1674
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:34,800
Okay, plus 22.

1675
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:36,000
X17.

1676
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:37,460
It's a bus time.

1677
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:39,520
Oh, I won anyway.

1678
01:08:39,580 --> 01:08:40,020
It doesn't matter.

1679
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:42,080
I won anyway.

1680
01:08:42,820 --> 01:08:44,500
Oh, that scared me a little bit.

1681
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:45,740
That scared...

1682
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:48,020
Oh, I thought the seven run was gone.

1683
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:50,680
Oh, that scared me just a little bit.

1684
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:51,400
Never punish.

1685
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:52,120
Let's go.

1686
01:08:52,580 --> 01:08:54,140
The dawn of the seven.

1687
01:08:54,420 --> 01:08:56,900
Play cards with hard suit game plus three.

1688
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:57,560
Wait.

1689
01:08:58,200 --> 01:08:59,460
I always play...

1690
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:01,820
Wait, double the money?

1691
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:03,900
Wait, is it doubles money?

1692
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:05,040
Maximum of 20.

1693
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:08,100
Wait.

1694
01:09:08,260 --> 01:09:09,400
Wait, I can double the money.

1695
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:10,720
Wait.

1696
01:09:11,220 --> 01:09:12,100
I want the hermit.

1697
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:15,280
Okay, hermit.

1698
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:17,000
But then I also...

1699
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,180
Guys, but I also get...

1700
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:22,320
I also play cards a lot.

1701
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:26,420
Oh my God.

1702
01:09:26,420 --> 01:09:27,800
We have $28 now.

1703
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:29,600
Do I get this?

1704
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:32,640
It said, yes, get the jewel.

1705
01:09:32,660 --> 01:09:33,680
Oh my God, you're right.

1706
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:35,220
It's red.

1707
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:36,260
It should be good.

1708
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:37,200
Let's go.

1709
01:09:39,660 --> 01:09:40,140
Alright.

1710
01:09:40,780 --> 01:09:41,500
Should I get any packs?

1711
01:09:43,540 --> 01:09:44,500
Which pack do I get?

1712
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:46,540
The jumbo or the buffoon pack?

1713
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:51,880
Buffoon?

1714
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:55,640
Put this guy on the left side?

1715
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:56,080
Why?

1716
01:09:56,340 --> 01:09:57,900
What's wrong with that?

1717
01:09:58,500 --> 01:09:59,300
Buffoon is better.

1718
01:09:59,420 --> 01:10:00,620
Alright, I'm rich anyway.

1719
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:01,920
I'm fucking rich as hell.

1720
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:02,780
What's the...

1721
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:05,580
It played...

1722
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:06,600
Hand contains a flesh.

1723
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:07,140
What's a flesh?

1724
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:08,640
I always keep forgetting what a flesh is.

1725
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:10,840
Like...

1726
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:15,020
Oh, let's share the same...

1727
01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:15,560
Oh, wait.

1728
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:17,140
Wait, is that good?

1729
01:10:18,740 --> 01:10:21,080
Suit changes every round.

1730
01:10:21,580 --> 01:10:23,020
Yeah, I should get the flesh face, right?

1731
01:10:33,780 --> 01:10:36,060
Castle is good because you discard all the time.

1732
01:10:36,740 --> 01:10:38,220
I do discard a lot.

1733
01:10:38,220 --> 01:10:40,120
Oh, this is difficult.

1734
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:43,840
A flesh 5.

1735
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:45,620
Yeah, but like...

1736
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:46,580
It's so risky.

1737
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:49,320
Am I really gonna get all hearts, though?

1738
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:50,460
Am I...

1739
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:53,740
I feel like...

1740
01:10:53,740 --> 01:10:55,580
I get more discards than hearts.

1741
01:10:55,780 --> 01:10:56,920
Yeah, I'm gonna do castle.

1742
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:58,400
I discard more.

1743
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:01,140
I feel like.

1744
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:03,180
Yeah, alright.

1745
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:03,900
Here we go.

1746
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:06,220
Next round.

1747
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:09,260
Oh my god, okay.

1748
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:14,840
Okay.

1749
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:18,360
I'll clone the...

1750
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:19,200
The spade.

1751
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:22,080
I'll copy the spade.

1752
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:23,260
Let's go.

1753
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:26,040
Fire, right?

1754
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:26,720
Okay, okay.

1755
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:27,800
I'm gonna...

1756
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:28,420
Oh, dupe.

1757
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:32,080
No, the clone the...

1758
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:33,220
Sorry, the club.

1759
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:34,220
I'll clone the club.

1760
01:11:34,580 --> 01:11:35,280
Or the heart?

1761
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:36,060
Oh, you're right!

1762
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:37,260
Because I have the heart!

1763
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:38,740
You're so right.

1764
01:11:39,810 --> 01:11:40,480
Almost forgot.

1765
01:11:40,820 --> 01:11:42,220
I got a plus 3 multiplier.

1766
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:46,060
Oh, castle to the far left?

1767
01:11:47,020 --> 01:11:47,600
Okay.

1768
01:11:47,900 --> 01:11:48,840
Far left, castle.

1769
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:50,360
Alright.

1770
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:52,400
And then...

1771
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:53,960
I'll just discard these guys.

1772
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:55,240
And then I'll get...

1773
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:56,940
I'll get 5 sevens.

1774
01:12:00,470 --> 01:12:01,130
Alright.

1775
01:12:05,010 --> 01:12:06,310
I'm gonna mine...

1776
01:12:06,310 --> 01:12:07,850
I'm gonna mine...

1777
01:12:07,850 --> 01:12:08,430
7 sevens now.

1778
01:12:10,270 --> 01:12:11,550
Alright, sevens.

1779
01:12:11,610 --> 01:12:13,210
2, 4, okay.

1780
01:12:13,530 --> 01:12:14,250
It's not a 7.

1781
01:12:14,450 --> 01:12:15,050
I don't care.

1782
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:16,410
Don't care.

1783
01:12:17,970 --> 01:12:19,110
Alright, here we go.

1784
01:12:19,230 --> 01:12:19,750
There we go.

1785
01:12:22,370 --> 01:12:23,010
Bam!

1786
01:12:27,650 --> 01:12:30,410
All the sevens in the world!

1787
01:12:31,830 --> 01:12:32,970
Let's go!

1788
01:12:34,210 --> 01:12:34,830
Alright!

1789
01:12:34,830 --> 01:12:36,010
I win.

1790
01:12:36,190 --> 01:12:37,710
What is this deck?

1791
01:12:37,870 --> 01:12:40,590
It's my special 7 deck.

1792
01:12:40,710 --> 01:12:42,570
It's my lucky deck, guys.

1793
01:12:43,110 --> 01:12:44,590
I'm building...

1794
01:12:44,590 --> 01:12:46,610
I'm building my lucky deck.

1795
01:12:47,290 --> 01:12:48,530
Let's go!

1796
01:12:49,410 --> 01:12:49,710
Alright.

1797
01:12:50,310 --> 01:12:53,410
Every time a playing card is added to your deck.

1798
01:12:54,090 --> 01:12:54,490
And...

1799
01:12:54,490 --> 01:12:56,550
$2 per discard.

1800
01:12:56,730 --> 01:12:58,670
If no discards are used by...

1801
01:12:58,670 --> 01:12:59,130
Oh, wait.

1802
01:12:59,150 --> 01:13:00,390
I always use discard, though.

1803
01:13:00,730 --> 01:13:01,170
Hologram?

1804
01:13:01,170 --> 01:13:03,030
The Joker gains...

1805
01:13:03,030 --> 01:13:05,150
Every time a playing card is...

1806
01:13:05,150 --> 01:13:06,070
Wait, is that good?

1807
01:13:06,590 --> 01:13:07,430
I guess it's good.

1808
01:13:08,590 --> 01:13:10,830
I don't know what it does, but okay.

1809
01:13:11,030 --> 01:13:12,090
I believe you guys.

1810
01:13:12,290 --> 01:13:12,350
Alright.

1811
01:13:15,910 --> 01:13:17,110
The Joker gains...

1812
01:13:17,110 --> 01:13:19,150
0.25...

1813
01:13:19,150 --> 01:13:21,390
Every time a playing card is added to your deck.

1814
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:22,670
Has only one card added.

1815
01:13:22,750 --> 01:13:23,490
Okay, cool.

1816
01:13:24,170 --> 01:13:24,490
Alright.

1817
01:13:25,870 --> 01:13:26,310
Okay.

1818
01:13:26,310 --> 01:13:26,510
Okay.

1819
01:13:28,030 --> 01:13:28,630
Let's see.

1820
01:13:32,630 --> 01:13:34,170
Celestial to upgrade?

1821
01:13:34,590 --> 01:13:36,910
Should I get Celestial or Arcane, guys?

1822
01:13:37,430 --> 01:13:38,170
Buy Arcane?

1823
01:13:38,310 --> 01:13:39,390
You're so good with this.

1824
01:13:39,650 --> 01:13:41,310
This is my first run.

1825
01:13:43,310 --> 01:13:46,670
This is literally my first run.

1826
01:13:49,390 --> 01:13:51,290
I don't know.

1827
01:13:51,490 --> 01:13:53,170
I just happened to get...

1828
01:13:53,170 --> 01:13:54,770
I just happened...

1829
01:13:54,770 --> 01:13:56,410
Oh my god, it has one...

1830
01:13:56,410 --> 01:13:58,090
Select a card and...

1831
01:13:58,090 --> 01:14:00,530
Increases rank of up to two selected cards.

1832
01:14:00,690 --> 01:14:02,410
Wait, I can increase my two!

1833
01:14:02,690 --> 01:14:04,510
I can increase my seven rank!

1834
01:14:08,270 --> 01:14:11,170
Wait, do I get...

1835
01:14:12,790 --> 01:14:15,470
Oh my god, they're so good!

1836
01:14:17,710 --> 01:14:18,270
Magician?

1837
01:14:18,650 --> 01:14:20,550
And has two selected cards, so lucky.

1838
01:14:20,550 --> 01:14:21,210
Wait.

1839
01:14:22,110 --> 01:14:23,930
Oh, it changes them to eight?

1840
01:14:25,090 --> 01:14:25,690
Oh!

1841
01:14:26,250 --> 01:14:27,710
Okay, I get it.

1842
01:14:28,170 --> 01:14:29,890
Wait, if I do Magician...

1843
01:14:29,890 --> 01:14:32,550
And I make my sevens lucky...

1844
01:14:33,290 --> 01:14:34,530
One in five chance for a...

1845
01:14:34,530 --> 01:14:35,970
Plus 20 multiplier?

1846
01:14:36,330 --> 01:14:37,290
One in 15...

1847
01:14:37,290 --> 01:14:39,970
Oh my god, a plus 20 multiplier?

1848
01:14:40,930 --> 01:14:42,030
Oh my god.

1849
01:14:45,150 --> 01:14:45,750
Oh!

1850
01:14:45,990 --> 01:14:47,390
Hang to eliminate...

1851
01:14:47,390 --> 01:14:48,410
Wait, okay.

1852
01:14:48,930 --> 01:14:49,930
Do I...

1853
01:14:49,930 --> 01:14:51,970
Okay, but multiplier is better, right?

1854
01:14:52,630 --> 01:14:54,270
If I get lucky sevens?

1855
01:14:54,650 --> 01:14:56,270
Oh my, wait, I can just...

1856
01:14:56,270 --> 01:14:58,870
I can just make my sevens so fucking lucky.

1857
01:15:06,230 --> 01:15:08,150
Oh my god, I don't know.

1858
01:15:08,510 --> 01:15:09,030
Do I...

1859
01:15:09,030 --> 01:15:12,210
Do I destroy my non-seven cards?

1860
01:15:12,690 --> 01:15:13,710
Or make...

1861
01:15:13,710 --> 01:15:15,770
Oh my god, do it.

1862
01:15:15,890 --> 01:15:17,870
I can make it so lucky.

1863
01:15:18,310 --> 01:15:20,690
Guys, it's a plus 20 multiplier.

1864
01:15:23,790 --> 01:15:25,990
Better sevens or kill lower cards?

1865
01:15:26,450 --> 01:15:27,970
Yes, but I will go...

1866
01:15:29,130 --> 01:15:31,250
Hangman means more sevens though, you're so right.

1867
01:15:31,590 --> 01:15:32,510
You're so fucking right.

1868
01:15:32,830 --> 01:15:34,730
I could literally have more sevens.

1869
01:15:35,050 --> 01:15:36,430
Oh, you're so right.

1870
01:15:36,890 --> 01:15:38,350
Wait, but then I can clone...

1871
01:15:38,350 --> 01:15:40,990
Guys, but then I can clone my lucky cards.

1872
01:15:40,990 --> 01:15:43,120
I can clone my lucky...

1873
01:15:43,650 --> 01:15:45,060
The lucky cards never...

1874
01:15:45,690 --> 01:15:47,910
Oh, the luck has a low chance of hitting?

1875
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:48,770
Alright, say less.

1876
01:15:49,170 --> 01:15:50,590
Alright, say less.

1877
01:15:55,610 --> 01:15:57,370
Goodbye, four and five.

1878
01:15:57,950 --> 01:15:59,310
Give me my sevens.

1879
01:15:59,410 --> 01:16:02,550
I need my sevens.

1880
01:16:04,930 --> 01:16:05,590
Alright.

1881
01:16:06,970 --> 01:16:08,530
Jumbo Celestial Pack.

1882
01:16:08,530 --> 01:16:09,810
Okay, I open.

1883
01:16:12,510 --> 01:16:13,890
Level up two pairs.

1884
01:16:14,250 --> 01:16:14,810
Plus one.

1885
01:16:14,890 --> 01:16:15,910
Level up full house.

1886
01:16:16,370 --> 01:16:16,930
Level up pair.

1887
01:16:17,030 --> 01:16:18,550
Oh my god, I level up a Flush.

1888
01:16:19,470 --> 01:16:20,110
Five cards.

1889
01:16:20,330 --> 01:16:21,010
Oh wait, no.

1890
01:16:22,550 --> 01:16:23,770
What about upgrade?

1891
01:16:24,070 --> 01:16:26,510
They're all pretty fucking bad, not gonna lie.

1892
01:16:26,870 --> 01:16:28,190
Not gonna...

1893
01:16:28,190 --> 01:16:30,210
Not gonna lie.

1894
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:32,150
Aeris?

1895
01:16:32,850 --> 01:16:34,190
Level up Flush five?

1896
01:16:34,890 --> 01:16:36,830
But when am I gonna get a Flush five?

1897
01:16:38,730 --> 01:16:41,490
You really think I'm gonna get a Flush five?

1898
01:16:43,150 --> 01:16:43,710
Really?

1899
01:16:45,450 --> 01:16:46,010
Alright.

1900
01:16:46,650 --> 01:16:47,210
Trust?

1901
01:16:47,310 --> 01:16:47,690
You're right.

1902
01:16:47,750 --> 01:16:48,690
It's all about gambling.

1903
01:16:48,870 --> 01:16:49,850
You're so right, guys.

1904
01:16:51,010 --> 01:16:52,130
Seven hearts.

1905
01:16:52,410 --> 01:16:54,350
Think of the seven hearts, Doki.

1906
01:16:55,210 --> 01:16:56,190
Think of it.

1907
01:16:56,530 --> 01:16:58,310
All club cards are debuffed.

1908
01:16:58,410 --> 01:16:59,130
Okay, don't worry.

1909
01:16:59,210 --> 01:16:59,910
I have hearts.

1910
01:17:00,970 --> 01:17:02,070
Oh, fuck.

1911
01:17:02,170 --> 01:17:02,510
Okay.

1912
01:17:02,770 --> 01:17:03,870
Okay, I'm gonna clone.

1913
01:17:04,010 --> 01:17:05,570
I'm gonna clone more sevens.

1914
01:17:05,570 --> 01:17:06,890
I'm gonna...

1915
01:17:07,670 --> 01:17:08,530
Let me...

1916
01:17:08,530 --> 01:17:10,470
Let me clone my sevens.

1917
01:17:11,250 --> 01:17:11,810
My...

1918
01:17:11,810 --> 01:17:14,930
Let me clone my hearts real quick.

1919
01:17:16,330 --> 01:17:18,010
I'm gonna clone my hearts.

1920
01:17:19,330 --> 01:17:20,470
Alright, plus one.

1921
01:17:20,590 --> 01:17:21,850
And I got the plus three.

1922
01:17:22,130 --> 01:17:23,530
And I got the plus six.

1923
01:17:23,730 --> 01:17:25,570
And I got the plus 1.5.

1924
01:17:25,830 --> 01:17:26,970
Fucking easy.

1925
01:17:27,510 --> 01:17:27,790
Alright.

1926
01:17:28,650 --> 01:17:30,850
And I'll discard the non-sevens.

1927
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:34,270
Uh...

1928
01:17:34,850 --> 01:17:37,030
Cause like, it's debuffed, so like...

1929
01:17:37,030 --> 01:17:38,970
I don't get anything, so I might as well...

1930
01:17:38,970 --> 01:17:39,550
Oh, discard.

1931
01:17:39,730 --> 01:17:40,630
I'm gonna...

1932
01:17:40,630 --> 01:17:42,310
Yeah, I'm gonna use my discard first.

1933
01:17:43,030 --> 01:17:45,590
And then, I'm gonna keep using my discard.

1934
01:17:46,530 --> 01:17:48,370
No, I can still use this.

1935
01:17:50,930 --> 01:17:52,730
I can still use this.

1936
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:55,210
But like...

1937
01:17:55,210 --> 01:17:57,430
If I play it, it doesn't count.

1938
01:17:59,250 --> 01:18:00,290
Play it?

1939
01:18:02,130 --> 01:18:03,150
Do I play it now?

1940
01:18:03,410 --> 01:18:06,630
But the debuff...

1941
01:18:06,630 --> 01:18:07,450
Just play them?

1942
01:18:07,570 --> 01:18:07,830
Okay.

1943
01:18:09,070 --> 01:18:10,690
I almost played the eight.

1944
01:18:11,050 --> 01:18:13,990
I almost played the eight.

1945
01:18:17,210 --> 01:18:18,810
Bro, the eight.

1946
01:18:21,910 --> 01:18:22,550
Okay.

1947
01:18:22,870 --> 01:18:23,590
I don't know.

1948
01:18:24,010 --> 01:18:25,010
I'll discard first.

1949
01:18:25,110 --> 01:18:25,950
Maybe I'll be lucky.

1950
01:18:25,950 --> 01:18:28,250
Maybe I'll get like, two more hearts.

1951
01:18:28,410 --> 01:18:29,750
Wait, no, but then I don't have...

1952
01:18:29,750 --> 01:18:34,030
No, but then I don't have like, space for... Wait, I could.

1953
01:18:34,410 --> 01:18:37,530
I could technically get...

1954
01:18:38,430 --> 01:18:40,390
I could technically... Okay, I'm gonna discard first.

1955
01:18:40,770 --> 01:18:41,730
I'm gonna discard first.

1956
01:18:42,390 --> 01:18:43,130
Oh my god.

1957
01:18:43,150 --> 01:18:45,310
Okay, this is a little unlucky right now.

1958
01:18:46,510 --> 01:18:47,830
Okay, I'm still gonna discard.

1959
01:18:50,430 --> 01:18:51,630
I'm gonna discard still.

1960
01:18:56,950 --> 01:18:59,170
If I discard this, I could get another seven.

1961
01:19:01,610 --> 01:19:02,930
One, two, three, four.

1962
01:19:03,270 --> 01:19:04,650
Oh my god, if I could get another...

1963
01:19:04,650 --> 01:19:06,910
I could get another seven.

1964
01:19:07,050 --> 01:19:08,830
I could get another seven.

1965
01:19:15,750 --> 01:19:16,810
Oh my god.

1966
01:19:18,570 --> 01:19:19,610
Wait, okay.

1967
01:19:20,550 --> 01:19:22,810
Wait, I could get a non-debuff seven though.

1968
01:19:23,370 --> 01:19:26,690
The green is already settling in.

1969
01:19:26,950 --> 01:19:33,010
Okay, what if I play this now and then... I could play this now though.

1970
01:19:33,190 --> 01:19:33,670
I...

1971
01:19:34,050 --> 01:19:35,070
I couldn't.

1972
01:19:36,550 --> 01:19:38,050
Okay, I'm gonna play it.

1973
01:19:38,230 --> 01:19:39,170
I'm gonna play it.

1974
01:19:42,130 --> 01:19:44,490
Oh, but then if I discard, I can get more castles.

1975
01:19:47,630 --> 01:19:48,550
I'm gonna do it.

1976
01:19:50,230 --> 01:19:51,230
I'm gonna do it.

1977
01:19:51,690 --> 01:19:53,330
I could get more sevens, guys.

1978
01:19:57,290 --> 01:19:58,050
It's fine.

1979
01:19:58,570 --> 01:19:59,330
I got the castle.

1980
01:19:59,330 --> 01:20:00,630
I got plus 19.

1981
01:20:00,730 --> 01:20:02,230
I got plus 1.5.

1982
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:03,690
I already won.

1983
01:20:05,870 --> 01:20:07,310
I already won.

1984
01:20:07,470 --> 01:20:07,670
Alright.

1985
01:20:12,210 --> 01:20:15,150
Alright, I don't need to play more cards.

1986
01:20:15,330 --> 01:20:15,670
It's alright.

1987
01:20:15,990 --> 01:20:16,870
Cash out time.

1988
01:20:17,070 --> 01:20:17,370
Yay!

1989
01:20:18,730 --> 01:20:21,550
Oh my god, I can destroy more cards that aren't seven!

1990
01:20:22,330 --> 01:20:23,370
Does nothing?

1991
01:20:24,030 --> 01:20:25,970
Wait, I can level up a straight flush.

1992
01:20:25,970 --> 01:20:27,690
What's a straight flush again?

1993
01:20:27,770 --> 01:20:29,450
I keep having to check.

1994
01:20:32,330 --> 01:20:34,170
Oh my god, another hangman.

1995
01:20:34,530 --> 01:20:36,890
I can buy nothing.

1996
01:20:37,670 --> 01:20:38,310
Wait.

1997
01:20:40,670 --> 01:20:42,110
How do I use it?

1998
01:20:44,130 --> 01:20:45,850
How do I fucking use it now?

1999
01:20:49,030 --> 01:20:51,470
Oh, and then there's a celestial.

2000
01:20:52,010 --> 01:20:52,510
Celestial.

2001
01:20:54,310 --> 01:20:55,930
Oh, I can use it later?

2002
01:20:56,530 --> 01:20:57,870
Oh, in the round.

2003
01:20:58,250 --> 01:20:58,750
Oh.

2004
01:21:00,950 --> 01:21:01,790
Oh, okay.

2005
01:21:02,790 --> 01:21:04,150
I have 17 dollars.

2006
01:21:04,250 --> 01:21:05,170
Is it worth buying?

2007
01:21:05,790 --> 01:21:08,010
Okay, buffoon pack or celestial pack chat?

2008
01:21:09,350 --> 01:21:09,850
DavidB7.

2009
01:21:10,170 --> 01:21:11,590
Thank you for the super chat.

2010
01:21:11,710 --> 01:21:12,070
Thank you.

2011
01:21:14,190 --> 01:21:16,250
Okay, save money.

2012
01:21:16,310 --> 01:21:17,130
Alright, I can do that.

2013
01:21:20,050 --> 01:21:21,030
Okay.

2014
01:21:21,030 --> 01:21:22,350
It says it does nothing.

2015
01:21:22,650 --> 01:21:23,130
Chat.

2016
01:21:24,310 --> 01:21:27,670
I'm not gonna buy nothing.

2017
01:21:28,630 --> 01:21:29,790
I'm not.

2018
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:32,190
Guys, I'm not gonna.

2019
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:35,510
I'm not.

2020
01:21:35,810 --> 01:21:40,650
But is it really nothing?

2021
01:21:44,790 --> 01:21:46,630
It's paid off.

2022
01:21:46,630 --> 01:21:47,950
I'm not gonna.

2023
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:51,250
I'm not gonna buy 10 of them.

2024
01:21:51,710 --> 01:21:53,750
Unlocks a plus one joker.

2025
01:21:54,550 --> 01:21:57,970
Alright, alright, fine.

2026
01:21:58,330 --> 01:21:59,570
Are you sure it's worth it?

2027
01:22:01,510 --> 01:22:02,330
Alright.

2028
01:22:02,750 --> 01:22:04,410
Alright, I'll invest.

2029
01:22:05,230 --> 01:22:06,730
I'll invest, guys.

2030
01:22:06,830 --> 01:22:09,270
I'm feeling particularly lucky today.

2031
01:22:09,910 --> 01:22:10,230
Alright.

2032
01:22:11,790 --> 01:22:13,270
I'm good to go.

2033
01:22:14,350 --> 01:22:17,090
Where's my sevens?

2034
01:22:17,130 --> 01:22:19,470
Okay, I'm gonna clone this seven.

2035
01:22:22,170 --> 01:22:22,790
What?

2036
01:22:23,170 --> 01:22:24,430
I just...

2037
01:22:24,430 --> 01:22:26,430
What do you mean I didn't listen to you guys?

2038
01:22:27,230 --> 01:22:29,030
What do you mean?

2039
01:22:29,150 --> 01:22:30,410
What do you mean?

2040
01:22:30,590 --> 01:22:31,490
Why not four?

2041
01:22:31,930 --> 01:22:34,430
I listened to you guys.

2042
01:22:36,490 --> 01:22:37,110
Alright.

2043
01:22:37,410 --> 01:22:40,590
Let's get rid of all these other filthy cards.

2044
01:22:43,790 --> 01:22:44,630
One, two, three.

2045
01:22:44,810 --> 01:22:45,030
Alright.

2046
01:22:45,590 --> 01:22:46,550
Get out of here.

2047
01:22:47,770 --> 01:22:49,270
Oh, destroy the cards?

2048
01:22:49,570 --> 01:22:51,610
Oh, I forgot to destroy them!

2049
01:22:51,770 --> 01:22:52,190
No!

2050
01:22:54,710 --> 01:22:56,290
Okay, we'll do that next time.

2051
01:22:57,510 --> 01:22:59,190
Guys, we'll do that next time.

2052
01:23:01,050 --> 01:23:03,110
Guys, we'll do it next time, guys.

2053
01:23:03,970 --> 01:23:05,230
One, two, three, four, five.

2054
01:23:05,270 --> 01:23:05,690
Oh, nice.

2055
01:23:06,670 --> 01:23:07,730
I can still discard.

2056
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:09,690
I'll just keep getting sevens.

2057
01:23:10,270 --> 01:23:11,130
I can still discard.

2058
01:23:11,850 --> 01:23:13,370
Yeah, but like, they're not...

2059
01:23:14,690 --> 01:23:16,790
Wait, can I...

2060
01:23:18,050 --> 01:23:19,530
How do I use it?

2061
01:23:22,390 --> 01:23:24,010
Oh, do I destroy these guys?

2062
01:23:24,390 --> 01:23:25,790
Can I just destroy these guys?

2063
01:23:33,180 --> 01:23:34,840
Oh, only destroy faces.

2064
01:23:35,060 --> 01:23:35,340
Okay.

2065
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:36,700
Okay, I will...

2066
01:23:37,300 --> 01:23:38,720
I'll destroy faces then.

2067
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:45,980
That's JQueenKing, right?

2068
01:23:46,620 --> 01:23:47,860
Is that JQueenKing?

2069
01:23:47,860 --> 01:23:48,940
Face cards?

2070
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:57,340
Alright, I'm gonna destroy... I'm gonna discard these guys first, so I can get the seven multiplier.

2071
01:23:57,520 --> 01:23:58,780
So I can get the castle multiplier.

2072
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:01,620
Discard.

2073
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:03,100
Yay, upgrade!

2074
01:24:04,140 --> 01:24:05,120
Ooh, alright.

2075
01:24:07,060 --> 01:24:07,640
Discard.

2076
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:13,480
Yay, upgrade!

2077
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:17,200
Oh, and then I can destroy these.

2078
01:24:18,140 --> 01:24:18,720
Use.

2079
01:24:23,890 --> 01:24:25,090
Okay.

2080
01:24:28,420 --> 01:24:29,280
Goodbye.

2081
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:31,200
Alright.

2082
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:34,140
Now I have... five!

2083
01:24:35,620 --> 01:24:37,920
Five sevens!

2084
01:24:38,140 --> 01:24:39,660
That's right!

2085
01:24:40,540 --> 01:24:42,200
Give me my multiplier!

2086
01:24:43,420 --> 01:24:45,180
That's fucking right!

2087
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:52,100
And then my castle and the boss and the plus one point fifty thousand!

2088
01:24:52,100 --> 01:24:54,220
Fuck it!

2089
01:24:57,900 --> 01:24:58,500
Alright.

2090
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:01,220
Burn, baby, burn!

2091
01:25:03,820 --> 01:25:04,720
Alright,

2092
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:09,140
nice.

2093
01:25:09,340 --> 01:25:10,580
This is pretty easy.

2094
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:11,960
It's just...

2095
01:25:13,090 --> 01:25:14,520
It's just that easy.

2096
01:25:17,620 --> 01:25:18,520
Oh...

2097
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:20,520
I have... Well, I got...

2098
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:21,340
Save?

2099
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:22,820
Arcana pack?

2100
01:25:22,820 --> 01:25:26,180
Choose one of up to be used in me... I would wait?

2101
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:28,660
If I buy the devil and...

2102
01:25:28,660 --> 01:25:30,440
Oh, if this card is held in hand...

2103
01:25:30,440 --> 01:25:32,420
Three dollars, this card is held in hand in the round.

2104
01:25:32,780 --> 01:25:34,880
You get more money if you get to twenty-five gold?

2105
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:35,280
Really?

2106
01:25:35,620 --> 01:25:37,180
Oh, I like the sound of that.

2107
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:38,020
I'll save.

2108
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:39,600
I can save.

2109
01:25:40,420 --> 01:25:40,740
Alright.

2110
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:43,260
What do I have?

2111
01:25:43,540 --> 01:25:44,120
Ooh, clone!

2112
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:46,360
Alright, play hand.

2113
01:25:49,740 --> 01:25:51,520
Give me my sevens!

2114
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:53,180
That's fucking right.

2115
01:25:53,460 --> 01:25:54,740
Give me my sevens.

2116
01:25:58,180 --> 01:26:02,560
Mr. Wade, give the five, give the six, thank you.

2117
01:26:02,660 --> 01:26:03,600
That's fucking right.

2118
01:26:04,180 --> 01:26:05,400
Give me my sevens.

2119
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:07,560
Thank you.

2120
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:10,140
Alright, two...

2121
01:26:10,140 --> 01:26:11,880
Okay, get rid of these guys.

2122
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:16,400
Okay, plus three chest per discarded heart.

2123
01:26:16,900 --> 01:26:17,180
Alright.

2124
01:26:17,180 --> 01:26:17,600
Okay.

2125
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:21,140
Alright, and then I get rid of you guys, too.

2126
01:26:21,420 --> 01:26:23,180
And then...

2127
01:26:24,940 --> 01:26:28,740
A single seven scored 2.6k.

2128
01:26:30,380 --> 01:26:33,180
The power of the sevens!

2129
01:26:34,300 --> 01:26:35,780
That's fucking right.

2130
01:26:36,160 --> 01:26:36,700
Oh, I got...

2131
01:26:36,700 --> 01:26:40,260
Select two cards, convert the left card into the right... what?

2132
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:42,160
The fuck does that mean?

2133
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:44,340
Alright, I gotta discard these guys.

2134
01:26:44,340 --> 01:26:45,740
Wait, what does this mean?

2135
01:26:46,060 --> 01:26:47,180
Do I save this?

2136
01:26:49,620 --> 01:26:52,340
Oh my god, I can convert into a seven?!

2137
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:58,180
Wait, I'm gonna save that.

2138
01:26:58,240 --> 01:26:58,960
I don't need that.

2139
01:26:59,300 --> 01:27:00,680
I don't need that yet.

2140
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:01,720
I'm gonna save it.

2141
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:03,620
Because I know I'm gonna reach...

2142
01:27:03,620 --> 01:27:05,160
I know I can get it.

2143
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:05,680
I...

2144
01:27:12,140 --> 01:27:15,660
No, but like...

2145
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:17,220
Why?!

2146
01:27:17,220 --> 01:27:18,560
I can save it.

2147
01:27:20,460 --> 01:27:21,640
Wait, is it permanent?

2148
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:24,780
Save it?

2149
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:26,820
Oh, save it for a face card.

2150
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:27,220
Okay.

2151
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:28,280
Oh, okay.

2152
01:27:30,460 --> 01:27:31,340
Oh, it's permanent?

2153
01:27:31,460 --> 01:27:32,220
Yeah, I don't need it yet.

2154
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:33,940
I don't need it yet.

2155
01:27:34,020 --> 01:27:35,960
I'd rather do it for... it's a permanent change.

2156
01:27:36,020 --> 01:27:36,520
Okay, wait.

2157
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:38,980
Convert the left card into the right.

2158
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:40,020
So if I...

2159
01:27:40,020 --> 01:27:40,680
Oh!

2160
01:27:41,300 --> 01:27:42,320
I'm gonna save it for a face.

2161
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:42,680
You're right.

2162
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:43,760
I'm gonna save it for a face.

2163
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:44,380
Yeah, yeah.

2164
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:45,140
I'm gonna save it.

2165
01:27:45,540 --> 01:27:46,780
Alright, I need more sevens.

2166
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:47,980
Okay, that's good enough.

2167
01:27:49,740 --> 01:27:55,220
But if I discard these two, I can get... I can get a fifth seven of hearts!

2168
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:57,600
Guys!

2169
01:27:57,880 --> 01:28:00,940
If I discard these two, I might get a fifth!

2170
01:28:01,180 --> 01:28:01,740
Guys!

2171
01:28:02,020 --> 01:28:03,560
Okay, I'm gonna discard these two.

2172
01:28:03,940 --> 01:28:05,560
I could get... Oh, mock!

2173
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:06,140
It's fine.

2174
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:06,760
This works.

2175
01:28:07,780 --> 01:28:08,740
It's fine.

2176
01:28:08,840 --> 01:28:09,540
I got four.

2177
01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:11,600
I got... It's fine.

2178
01:28:11,700 --> 01:28:12,640
This is good enough.

2179
01:28:12,980 --> 01:28:14,800
This is actually good enough.

2180
01:28:15,080 --> 01:28:15,440
Alright.

2181
01:28:17,220 --> 01:28:18,340
Alright, here we go.

2182
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:20,960
Nice.

2183
01:28:21,540 --> 01:28:24,020
And then I got another plus three.

2184
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:27,960
And then another one.

2185
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:29,500
And then plus thirty-six.

2186
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:30,440
Plus twenty-three.

2187
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:31,780
Next one, hundred.

2188
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:35,080
Okay, I got twenty-six thousand dollars.

2189
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:36,400
Oh, nice.

2190
01:28:37,060 --> 01:28:39,000
I could have had a flush.

2191
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:41,540
Guys, we should be happy.

2192
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:44,420
I even made it this far.

2193
01:28:45,340 --> 01:28:45,940
Whoa!

2194
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:48,600
Play cards with Aura and skip plus twenty.

2195
01:28:48,780 --> 01:28:49,380
Guys!

2196
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:50,760
Seven is in!

2197
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:57,740
Oh my god!

2198
01:28:58,080 --> 01:28:58,660
Oh my god!

2199
01:28:58,660 --> 01:29:00,020
Seven is in there!

2200
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:01,220
Oh my god!

2201
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:02,320
I gotta get it!

2202
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:11,480
Wait, do I have to sell?

2203
01:29:11,820 --> 01:29:13,300
Should I sell the castle?

2204
01:29:18,410 --> 01:29:20,910
Wait, but does it... Does it build up?

2205
01:29:22,710 --> 01:29:23,930
Oh, sell the castle.

2206
01:29:24,030 --> 01:29:24,270
Okay.

2207
01:29:24,690 --> 01:29:25,410
I'll sell you.

2208
01:29:27,970 --> 01:29:31,230
Oh, does that... does that go up?

2209
01:29:31,710 --> 01:29:33,170
Oh, for each seven!

2210
01:29:33,410 --> 01:29:34,670
Oh my... Goodbye, castle.

2211
01:29:34,790 --> 01:29:35,670
You were good to me.

2212
01:29:35,990 --> 01:29:38,330
You were so good to me, but right now, I need seven.

2213
01:29:38,650 --> 01:29:40,330
I need seven!

2214
01:29:42,850 --> 01:29:43,330
Okay.

2215
01:29:43,870 --> 01:29:44,170
Alright.

2216
01:29:47,810 --> 01:29:48,290
Okay.

2217
01:29:48,590 --> 01:29:49,070
Alright.

2218
01:29:49,070 --> 01:29:49,270
Alright.

2219
01:29:50,670 --> 01:29:52,470
Move it to the far left here.

2220
01:29:56,110 --> 01:29:57,250
Reorganize your joker.

2221
01:29:57,410 --> 01:29:58,270
Okay, joker order.

2222
01:29:58,390 --> 01:29:59,150
That should be five.

2223
01:29:59,790 --> 01:30:02,450
Do I... Should I save or... Oh, flush five.

2224
01:30:02,690 --> 01:30:04,570
I don't know if I'll get a flush five, though.

2225
01:30:04,630 --> 01:30:06,070
It's freaking rare as hell.

2226
01:30:06,570 --> 01:30:07,690
It's so rare.

2227
01:30:09,150 --> 01:30:09,590
Oh.

2228
01:30:10,370 --> 01:30:12,110
Alright, buy and use.

2229
01:30:13,330 --> 01:30:14,690
Okay, I'll buy and use.

2230
01:30:15,030 --> 01:30:16,530
I trust you guys.

2231
01:30:17,970 --> 01:30:19,430
I trust you.

2232
01:30:20,710 --> 01:30:21,270
Okay.

2233
01:30:22,150 --> 01:30:24,990
Alright, you're building a flush five.

2234
01:30:25,310 --> 01:30:25,750
Alright.

2235
01:30:26,630 --> 01:30:28,250
I think I can go to the...

2236
01:30:28,250 --> 01:30:29,710
Do I take the arcana pack, too?

2237
01:30:30,390 --> 01:30:32,470
Oh, I can...

2238
01:30:33,050 --> 01:30:34,570
Oh, it'll pay off.

2239
01:30:34,730 --> 01:30:35,010
Okay.

2240
01:30:35,930 --> 01:30:38,450
Should I save or go for the arcana pack, guys?

2241
01:30:42,010 --> 01:30:42,570
Arcana's...

2242
01:30:43,730 --> 01:30:44,410
Hmm...

2243
01:30:47,670 --> 01:30:48,350
Ahhh...

2244
01:30:49,190 --> 01:30:49,870
Save.

2245
01:30:49,950 --> 01:30:50,630
I'm gonna save.

2246
01:30:50,950 --> 01:30:51,890
Alright, what's the next one?

2247
01:30:51,970 --> 01:30:55,290
Kai's drawn face down after each hand... What?

2248
01:30:55,790 --> 01:30:56,190
Oh.

2249
01:30:56,870 --> 01:30:57,310
Okay.

2250
01:30:58,370 --> 01:31:00,490
Alright, this is getting scary now.

2251
01:31:00,870 --> 01:31:04,030
This is getting real scary now.

2252
01:31:05,130 --> 01:31:05,810
Wow.

2253
01:31:06,310 --> 01:31:08,110
I can still discard, right?

2254
01:31:12,030 --> 01:31:13,790
I'm gonna discard first.

2255
01:31:17,740 --> 01:31:20,340
Yeah, I'm gonna discard four hearts so I can clone it.

2256
01:31:21,220 --> 01:31:22,460
Okay, two, four, five.

2257
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:22,720
Okay.

2258
01:31:23,580 --> 01:31:24,180
Discard.

2259
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:26,460
Oh my god.

2260
01:31:26,540 --> 01:31:26,820
Yes!

2261
01:31:27,700 --> 01:31:28,300
Yes!

2262
01:31:29,380 --> 01:31:30,180
My seven!

2263
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:31,740
My seven!

2264
01:31:34,940 --> 01:31:35,540
Hahaha!

2265
01:31:35,540 --> 01:31:36,140
Yes!

2266
01:31:36,900 --> 01:31:37,500
Yes!

2267
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:38,600
Yes!

2268
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:40,680
Okay.

2269
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:40,800
Okay.

2270
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:42,960
This is so dumb.

2271
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:47,480
Oh yeah!

2272
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:48,240
Okay.

2273
01:31:50,180 --> 01:31:52,160
So I can turn these two into seven.

2274
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:55,560
Oh wait, turn your left card into the right card.

2275
01:31:56,040 --> 01:31:59,940
So all I do is put this...

2276
01:31:59,940 --> 01:32:01,080
and then I'll do that.

2277
01:32:01,480 --> 01:32:06,640
Wait, turn your left card into the right card and then I do that.

2278
01:32:07,240 --> 01:32:08,000
There we go.

2279
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:14,260
Is that not how you arrange it?

2280
01:32:14,340 --> 01:32:16,080
It's the left card to the right card.

2281
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:17,300
No?

2282
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:19,520
Oh!

2283
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:23,200
Wait, but it says...

2284
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:24,720
Wait, what?

2285
01:32:25,900 --> 01:32:26,940
I'm confused.

2286
01:32:27,220 --> 01:32:29,740
Do I do this and then I do this?

2287
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:31,720
Oh!

2288
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:34,220
Is that how it works?

2289
01:32:37,180 --> 01:32:38,160
Is that it?

2290
01:32:38,340 --> 01:32:39,340
I'm a little confused.

2291
01:32:45,090 --> 01:32:45,950
Oh, okay.

2292
01:32:46,810 --> 01:32:48,210
Become a seven!

2293
01:32:49,470 --> 01:32:50,030
Hahaha!

2294
01:32:52,670 --> 01:32:55,870
And thus, you shall become a seven!

2295
01:32:58,030 --> 01:32:58,590
Hahaha!

2296
01:32:59,010 --> 01:33:00,490
One, two, okay.

2297
01:33:00,910 --> 01:33:01,910
Alright, get out of here.

2298
01:33:01,970 --> 01:33:02,830
You're not a seven.

2299
01:33:03,630 --> 01:33:06,330
Alright, get out of here.

2300
01:33:08,730 --> 01:33:10,350
One, two, three, four, five.

2301
01:33:10,410 --> 01:33:11,050
Alright, let's go.

2302
01:33:11,050 --> 01:33:11,750
Hahaha!

2303
01:33:12,270 --> 01:33:13,230
Let's go!

2304
01:33:13,650 --> 01:33:15,370
One, two, three, four, five.

2305
01:33:15,730 --> 01:33:17,290
Alright, get in here.

2306
01:33:19,710 --> 01:33:21,110
Two, four, alright.

2307
01:33:21,750 --> 01:33:23,270
And thus, the seven.

2308
01:33:23,390 --> 01:33:25,690
The seven deck is made again.

2309
01:33:26,610 --> 01:33:27,370
There we go.

2310
01:33:27,430 --> 01:33:28,250
One, six, five.

2311
01:33:28,370 --> 01:33:29,250
One, nine, six.

2312
01:33:29,650 --> 01:33:31,310
Oh, it's still going up.

2313
01:33:31,790 --> 01:33:32,030
Woah!

2314
01:33:33,670 --> 01:33:34,270
Woah!

2315
01:33:34,910 --> 01:33:36,530
It's still going up!

2316
01:33:36,830 --> 01:33:37,270
Woah!

2317
01:33:39,650 --> 01:33:41,410
56,982!

2318
01:33:41,610 --> 01:33:44,250
Guys, you think I got $22,000 yet?

2319
01:33:44,710 --> 01:33:47,730
You think I got...

2320
01:33:47,730 --> 01:33:48,290
Hahaha!

2321
01:33:49,270 --> 01:33:50,250
Oh, the numbers.

2322
01:33:50,430 --> 01:33:51,710
What are they saying?

2323
01:33:52,090 --> 01:33:53,970
What are they saying?

2324
01:33:54,850 --> 01:33:55,290
Hahaha!

2325
01:33:57,070 --> 01:33:57,790
Hahaha!

2326
01:34:00,170 --> 01:34:03,030
What do the numbers mean, guys?

2327
01:34:03,270 --> 01:34:05,630
What do the numbers mean?

2328
01:34:05,630 --> 01:34:06,550
Hahaha!

2329
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:15,000
Buy the Voucher?

2330
01:34:15,700 --> 01:34:18,100
Minus one ante, minus one hand?

2331
01:34:19,460 --> 01:34:20,560
Wait, are you sure?

2332
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:22,600
But it says minus one.

2333
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:24,540
Yeah, I'm not kidding.

2334
01:34:24,660 --> 01:34:27,160
It feels like the Voucher.

2335
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:27,880
I'm gonna save.

2336
01:34:28,420 --> 01:34:30,840
I don't think I need any of these.

2337
01:34:32,340 --> 01:34:32,920
Yeah.

2338
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:33,020
Yeah.

2339
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:37,000
I don't think I need any packs.

2340
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:41,300
You're only playing two hands per round.

2341
01:34:44,260 --> 01:34:46,020
I feel like...

2342
01:34:46,020 --> 01:34:47,480
Okay, I'll do Arcana pack.

2343
01:34:48,420 --> 01:34:50,260
Alright, what kind of good packs are there?

2344
01:34:51,460 --> 01:34:52,940
Wait, I can make more sevens!

2345
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:53,560
Hahaha!

2346
01:34:54,120 --> 01:34:55,660
Okay, wait.

2347
01:34:57,020 --> 01:34:59,260
Guys, I can make more sevens!

2348
01:34:59,280 --> 01:34:59,580
Guys!

2349
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:01,780
Oh my god!

2350
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:03,560
Oh my god, I can make...

2351
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:04,180
Hahaha!

2352
01:35:06,680 --> 01:35:07,620
Oh my god!

2353
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:09,260
I can make another seven!

2354
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:10,680
Hahaha!

2355
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:14,860
Queen into seven.

2356
01:35:15,300 --> 01:35:17,560
Okay, I'm sliding to the right card.

2357
01:35:17,700 --> 01:35:18,640
Alright, there you go.

2358
01:35:19,140 --> 01:35:19,880
Good move.

2359
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:20,680
This is right.

2360
01:35:20,820 --> 01:35:21,440
This is it, right?

2361
01:35:22,680 --> 01:35:23,640
Left to right.

2362
01:35:23,780 --> 01:35:25,000
Okay, convert the left card.

2363
01:35:25,120 --> 01:35:25,860
Okay, there you go.

2364
01:35:25,860 --> 01:35:27,560
And thus...

2365
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:29,740
You shall become a seven!

2366
01:35:31,720 --> 01:35:32,060
Hahaha!

2367
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:34,480
Alright, next round.

2368
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:35,940
Alright, let's go.

2369
01:35:37,660 --> 01:35:38,000
Alright.

2370
01:35:38,580 --> 01:35:41,200
Let's get rid of all these non-fuck...

2371
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:41,620
Okay, wait.

2372
01:35:41,860 --> 01:35:44,280
First off, we use the clone first.

2373
01:35:44,440 --> 01:35:46,060
So we get another seven.

2374
01:35:46,980 --> 01:35:48,000
And then...

2375
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,160
After that...

2376
01:35:50,160 --> 01:35:51,540
Alright, plus three, multiply.

2377
01:35:51,780 --> 01:35:53,540
Plus ten, plus twenty-six.

2378
01:35:53,540 --> 01:35:54,060
Next one.

2379
01:35:54,160 --> 01:35:54,980
Oh my god.

2380
01:35:55,020 --> 01:35:55,540
Let's go.

2381
01:35:55,660 --> 01:35:57,040
Oh, now it's five thousand.

2382
01:35:57,320 --> 01:35:57,780
Wow!

2383
01:35:58,220 --> 01:36:00,580
And then we get rid of these guys.

2384
01:36:01,240 --> 01:36:03,060
Uh, cause you're not a seven.

2385
01:36:03,740 --> 01:36:05,520
And then one, two, three, four, five.

2386
01:36:05,620 --> 01:36:06,100
You know what?

2387
01:36:06,160 --> 01:36:08,500
Let's just try and get...

2388
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:09,740
Three more hearts.

2389
01:36:10,340 --> 01:36:10,820
Uh...

2390
01:36:10,820 --> 01:36:11,380
Hahaha!

2391
01:36:11,740 --> 01:36:12,640
Let's just...

2392
01:36:12,640 --> 01:36:15,460
Let's just get three more hearts.

2393
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:16,200
Like, you know?

2394
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:17,440
It doesn't matter.

2395
01:36:17,560 --> 01:36:19,860
Actually, it doesn't really matter about discards anymore.

2396
01:36:21,240 --> 01:36:21,720
Like...

2397
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:24,600
I feel like discards don't matter cause I don't have a castle anyway.

2398
01:36:24,760 --> 01:36:25,880
So like, who fucking cares?

2399
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:27,180
I'll just fucking play the card.

2400
01:36:27,860 --> 01:36:28,340
Like...

2401
01:36:29,340 --> 01:36:33,320
Here we go.

2402
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:35,360
But...

2403
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:36,500
Let's go.

2404
01:36:37,740 --> 01:36:38,940
Yeah, no castle.

2405
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:41,340
Here we go.

2406
01:36:41,460 --> 01:36:41,920
Yeah!

2407
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:48,560
Woo!

2408
01:36:50,340 --> 01:36:52,740
But what about the flush five, donkey?

2409
01:36:53,260 --> 01:36:54,400
Think about the...

2410
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:57,400
Think about the adrenaline you're gonna get when you get a plus...

2411
01:36:57,400 --> 01:36:58,740
Plus five.

2412
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:01,320
The card to give you plus three...

2413
01:37:01,320 --> 01:37:02,780
Plus two chips each...

2414
01:37:02,780 --> 01:37:05,480
For each remaining card in deck.

2415
01:37:05,900 --> 01:37:06,900
Currently a hun...

2416
01:37:06,900 --> 01:37:07,700
No, I don't need...

2417
01:37:07,700 --> 01:37:10,120
Oh, there's a mega celestial pack?

2418
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:12,540
And a jumbo celestial pack?

2419
01:37:12,840 --> 01:37:13,840
Oh, there are...

2420
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:15,240
Okay, I wanna get the mega.

2421
01:37:16,840 --> 01:37:17,800
Not worth?

2422
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,020
Is it really not worth?

2423
01:37:22,120 --> 01:37:23,220
Is it really?

2424
01:37:24,940 --> 01:37:25,860
What the fuck?

2425
01:37:26,300 --> 01:37:26,720
Mega!

2426
01:37:29,620 --> 01:37:31,100
Mega the next round?

2427
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:33,880
Oh, it is worth?

2428
01:37:33,980 --> 01:37:35,160
Okay, I'm gonna do it.

2429
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:36,200
Mega pack.

2430
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:38,980
Choose two.

2431
01:37:39,900 --> 01:37:40,740
Level up pair...

2432
01:37:40,740 --> 01:37:41,660
Level up hide card?

2433
01:37:41,660 --> 01:37:43,360
What the fuck is a hide card?

2434
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:48,800
The player has only the highest rank card scores.

2435
01:37:48,900 --> 01:37:49,220
Okay.

2436
01:37:49,960 --> 01:37:50,660
Level up flush?

2437
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:51,860
Level up straight flush?

2438
01:37:52,140 --> 01:37:53,580
Level up four of a kind?

2439
01:37:54,540 --> 01:37:55,320
Let's see.

2440
01:37:56,060 --> 01:37:57,360
A hide card is one.

2441
01:37:57,520 --> 01:37:57,820
Wait.

2442
01:38:00,280 --> 01:38:01,920
Wait, is it just one card?

2443
01:38:02,360 --> 01:38:03,660
That's just one card, right?

2444
01:38:08,010 --> 01:38:09,730
Level up four of a kind.

2445
01:38:10,650 --> 01:38:11,750
Level up straight flush.

2446
01:38:12,310 --> 01:38:12,990
Level up straight flush.

2447
01:38:13,110 --> 01:38:14,810
I keep forgetting what straight flush is.

2448
01:38:14,890 --> 01:38:21,710
I always have to fucking look at it.

2449
01:38:22,690 --> 01:38:23,790
Pluto and Mars.

2450
01:38:24,710 --> 01:38:24,930
Oh!

2451
01:38:25,310 --> 01:38:26,110
Level up four of a kind.

2452
01:38:26,270 --> 01:38:26,910
Oh, that's true.

2453
01:38:27,030 --> 01:38:28,970
I'm gonna get Pluto first because it's like one.

2454
01:38:31,310 --> 01:38:33,050
Okay, because it's the DNA, right?

2455
01:38:34,350 --> 01:38:35,090
Yeah, DNA.

2456
01:38:36,570 --> 01:38:37,750
It's for the sevens.

2457
01:38:37,770 --> 01:38:38,450
You're so right.

2458
01:38:38,450 --> 01:38:39,390
Yeah, for the sevens.

2459
01:38:39,390 --> 01:38:43,170
If I'm desperate, I can get four of a kind.

2460
01:38:44,230 --> 01:38:46,010
But then like...

2461
01:38:46,610 --> 01:38:48,210
If I do straight flush...

2462
01:38:48,210 --> 01:38:51,350
Okay, not straight flush, but...

2463
01:38:51,350 --> 01:38:52,290
Was it just a flush?

2464
01:38:53,450 --> 01:38:54,450
I could have...

2465
01:38:55,970 --> 01:38:58,470
All sevens with...

2466
01:38:58,470 --> 01:39:00,450
Then what if I have all sevens with...

2467
01:39:03,150 --> 01:39:04,450
We have sevens.

2468
01:39:05,830 --> 01:39:07,270
You're right, four of a kind.

2469
01:39:07,270 --> 01:39:08,970
Oh, the multiplayer is bigger.

2470
01:39:09,150 --> 01:39:09,610
Oh, wait.

2471
01:39:13,990 --> 01:39:18,150
Wait, but the multiplayer is bigger for four of a kind versus like...

2472
01:39:18,150 --> 01:39:19,730
Yeah, four is better.

2473
01:39:19,790 --> 01:39:20,570
You're right, guys.

2474
01:39:20,670 --> 01:39:21,550
Four is so much better.

2475
01:39:24,450 --> 01:39:24,970
Alright.

2476
01:39:25,350 --> 01:39:26,470
We're good to go.

2477
01:39:26,850 --> 01:39:27,590
Next round.

2478
01:39:28,250 --> 01:39:28,950
Let's go.

2479
01:39:31,090 --> 01:39:32,150
Oh my God.

2480
01:39:33,830 --> 01:39:35,650
Let's keep making my hearts.

2481
01:39:36,030 --> 01:39:36,830
Let's go.

2482
01:39:37,050 --> 01:39:37,790
Let's keep...

2483
01:39:42,590 --> 01:39:43,070
Alright.

2484
01:39:43,230 --> 01:39:43,430
Alright.

2485
01:39:43,430 --> 01:39:44,090
No, we got it.

2486
01:39:44,350 --> 01:39:46,610
I'm getting my sevens first, guys.

2487
01:39:46,730 --> 01:39:50,170
I'm getting my sevens.

2488
01:39:50,530 --> 01:39:51,230
Let's go.

2489
01:39:51,330 --> 01:39:52,570
It's calling to us.

2490
01:39:53,170 --> 01:39:55,550
The sevens are calling to us.

2491
01:39:55,650 --> 01:39:55,990
Chat.

2492
01:39:57,030 --> 01:39:57,510
Nice.

2493
01:39:58,470 --> 01:40:00,630
Alright, and then we get rid of these guys.

2494
01:40:02,150 --> 01:40:02,630
Goodbye.

2495
01:40:03,130 --> 01:40:04,630
Oh, I need to sell the tower, right?

2496
01:40:05,290 --> 01:40:05,730
Wonderful.

2497
01:40:06,530 --> 01:40:07,250
Okay.

2498
01:40:07,610 --> 01:40:08,350
I won.

2499
01:40:15,510 --> 01:40:16,230
Nice.

2500
01:40:16,990 --> 01:40:19,550
Oh my God, look at the numbers.

2501
01:40:19,710 --> 01:40:21,530
It keeps going up.

2502
01:40:22,770 --> 01:40:25,730
500x, 200x, 400x.

2503
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:31,340
Let's go.

2504
01:40:33,540 --> 01:40:35,320
Speed up, please.

2505
01:40:35,820 --> 01:40:38,200
No, I like to see it go.

2506
01:40:38,200 --> 01:40:40,200
I like...

2507
01:40:41,300 --> 01:40:42,920
Oh, a standard pack.

2508
01:40:43,140 --> 01:40:44,020
Oh my God.

2509
01:40:44,040 --> 01:40:45,740
I could get a seven in a standard pack.

2510
01:40:46,060 --> 01:40:47,440
I should sell the tower, right?

2511
01:40:49,700 --> 01:40:51,480
Numbers go up.

2512
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:56,920
Highway Tech, thank you for the magenta super.

2513
01:40:57,120 --> 01:40:58,520
For your very first super.

2514
01:40:59,100 --> 01:40:59,620
Thank you.

2515
01:40:59,940 --> 01:41:00,560
Thank you.

2516
01:41:03,080 --> 01:41:03,600
Alright.

2517
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:05,220
I could get more sevens.

2518
01:41:05,220 --> 01:41:06,280
You're so right.

2519
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:07,740
I could get more sevens.

2520
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:09,740
Wait, what's a steel card?

2521
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:12,320
While this card stays in hand?

2522
01:41:14,780 --> 01:41:16,720
Buy a standard...

2523
01:41:17,740 --> 01:41:19,980
And check the card pile on the bottom.

2524
01:41:22,540 --> 01:41:23,120
7777.

2525
01:41:24,920 --> 01:41:26,920
Should I sell the tower, chat?

2526
01:41:30,460 --> 01:41:31,040
7777.

2527
01:41:35,220 --> 01:41:36,340
Alright, I sell the tower.

2528
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:38,740
And then I buy...

2529
01:41:38,740 --> 01:41:39,720
The chariot.

2530
01:41:40,020 --> 01:41:42,560
So, as long as...

2531
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:43,580
I don't...

2532
01:41:43,580 --> 01:41:45,600
What's a steel card, though?

2533
01:41:45,620 --> 01:41:46,760
What does a steel card mean?

2534
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:50,060
See, thank you for the 7777, super chat.

2535
01:41:50,380 --> 01:41:51,320
Thank you, thank you.

2536
01:41:55,120 --> 01:41:56,380
Chariot for non...

2537
01:41:56,380 --> 01:41:57,460
Don't buy...

2538
01:41:57,460 --> 01:42:00,240
I don't know what the chariot is.

2539
01:42:00,780 --> 01:42:03,240
Steal a seven that's not a heart?

2540
01:42:03,740 --> 01:42:05,920
You keep it to get 1.5?

2541
01:42:06,340 --> 01:42:07,800
Or do I just not use it?

2542
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:11,240
If I don't use it, it'll always give me a 1.5 multiplier, right?

2543
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:14,200
7777.

2544
01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:15,540
Thank you for the super chat.

2545
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:16,960
Thank you, thank you.

2546
01:42:18,240 --> 01:42:19,300
Okay, I'll buy the...

2547
01:42:19,300 --> 01:42:20,240
I'm fucking rich anyway.

2548
01:42:20,380 --> 01:42:21,120
I'll buy the chariot.

2549
01:42:21,240 --> 01:42:21,640
Fuck it.

2550
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:23,280
And then I'll buy the standard pack.

2551
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:24,480
I might get a seven.

2552
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:26,900
I might... YES!

2553
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:29,980
Let's go!

2554
01:42:31,140 --> 01:42:32,880
Let's fucking go!

2555
01:42:39,540 --> 01:42:41,200
Oh my god.

2556
01:42:41,620 --> 01:42:44,220
Thank you for the super chat.

2557
01:42:44,540 --> 01:42:45,780
Thank you, thank you.

2558
01:42:46,260 --> 01:42:49,380
Wait, why do I get the four when I could get the seven?

2559
01:42:49,380 --> 01:42:49,920
Seven!

2560
01:42:55,260 --> 01:42:59,100
But it's not seven though!

2561
01:42:59,740 --> 01:43:01,280
It's not a seven!

2562
01:43:03,080 --> 01:43:05,600
Okay, oh, as long as I don't discard this.

2563
01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:06,240
Oh, you're right.

2564
01:43:06,500 --> 01:43:08,820
If I don't discard it...

2565
01:43:09,660 --> 01:43:11,280
Oh my god, I don't know.

2566
01:43:12,160 --> 01:43:13,340
A steel stack?

2567
01:43:13,640 --> 01:43:16,040
But then like, I can't discard it though.

2568
01:43:20,700 --> 01:43:23,100
Guys, I can't discard it!

2569
01:43:25,260 --> 01:43:27,540
I need more cards to discard!

2570
01:43:28,220 --> 01:43:29,980
We gotta get the sevens.

2571
01:43:29,980 --> 01:43:32,580
Steel is a seven of hearts and cop.

2572
01:43:32,680 --> 01:43:33,440
Yeah, I'm gonna...

2573
01:43:33,440 --> 01:43:34,720
I'm gonna get the seven.

2574
01:43:35,340 --> 01:43:36,920
But the seven!

2575
01:43:39,460 --> 01:43:41,120
We need more sevens!

2576
01:43:41,120 --> 01:43:41,800
I don't care!

2577
01:43:42,240 --> 01:43:43,680
I need more sevens.

2578
01:43:43,740 --> 01:43:46,700
I need more sevens in my deck.

2579
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:48,740
No repeat hand type.

2580
01:43:48,740 --> 01:43:49,680
No repeat hand types this round.

2581
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:50,600
Wait, what does that mean?

2582
01:43:51,580 --> 01:43:54,260
What does no repeat hand types this round?

2583
01:43:55,340 --> 01:43:55,720
Wait!

2584
01:43:57,960 --> 01:43:58,520
Wait!

2585
01:44:00,260 --> 01:44:03,020
Wait, does that mean I can't use sevens anymore?

2586
01:44:05,680 --> 01:44:07,120
I can one-shot it!

2587
01:44:07,700 --> 01:44:09,520
Guys, I can one-shot it!

2588
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:13,560
I can one-shot it, guys!

2589
01:44:13,980 --> 01:44:16,280
Alright, we'll play...

2590
01:44:17,120 --> 01:44:18,540
I can play one...

2591
01:44:18,540 --> 01:44:19,920
I only have to play one seven.

2592
01:44:20,580 --> 01:44:21,760
And then...

2593
01:44:22,820 --> 01:44:23,580
It's fine.

2594
01:44:23,780 --> 01:44:25,040
I play one seven.

2595
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:26,960
That's fine, it works.

2596
01:44:29,980 --> 01:44:31,560
Oh, I forgot to steal it!

2597
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:32,080
No!

2598
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:35,040
I forgot to steal it.

2599
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:38,260
Alright, it's fine.

2600
01:44:38,380 --> 01:44:39,180
I'll steal it later.

2601
01:44:39,300 --> 01:44:40,400
I don't need to steal it yet.

2602
01:44:40,980 --> 01:44:42,560
Do I really need to steal a seven?

2603
01:44:43,620 --> 01:44:45,820
I want to put these guys away first.

2604
01:44:45,900 --> 01:44:47,320
I'm going to discard these guys first.

2605
01:44:51,460 --> 01:44:52,820
Yeah, I'll do it next time.

2606
01:44:52,860 --> 01:44:53,840
I'm not desperate enough.

2607
01:44:55,440 --> 01:44:57,640
Okay, I'll get rid of all these guys first.

2608
01:44:58,080 --> 01:44:58,660
And then I get...

2609
01:44:58,660 --> 01:45:00,240
Give the total sell value of all...

2610
01:45:00,240 --> 01:45:01,360
Fucking, I don't need that.

2611
01:45:01,620 --> 01:45:02,940
One, two, three, four, five.

2612
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:03,640
Okay, I won.

2613
01:45:10,860 --> 01:45:11,420
I won.

2614
01:45:11,420 --> 01:45:12,240
One, two, three, four.

2615
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:13,160
I won.

2616
01:45:16,870 --> 01:45:17,430
Alright.

2617
01:45:18,230 --> 01:45:19,190
Free money.

2618
01:45:21,310 --> 01:45:23,410
Use the total sell value of all...

2619
01:45:23,850 --> 01:45:24,850
I can do this whenever.

2620
01:45:26,730 --> 01:45:28,230
Wait, do I use it now?

2621
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:33,840
Steal the non-hard sell...

2622
01:45:33,840 --> 01:45:34,140
No?

2623
01:45:34,140 --> 01:45:36,180
Doesn't it sell my stuff?

2624
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:42,020
Use the total sell value of all...

2625
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:43,640
Current Joker?

2626
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:45,680
No?

2627
01:45:46,220 --> 01:45:47,260
Oh, it's free money?

2628
01:45:47,880 --> 01:45:48,380
Oh, okay.

2629
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:50,120
I like free money.

2630
01:45:51,060 --> 01:45:52,160
Yay, alright.

2631
01:45:52,580 --> 01:45:55,380
I don't need to steal it yet.

2632
01:45:56,540 --> 01:45:57,280
I'm fucking...

2633
01:45:57,280 --> 01:45:58,120
It's already won.

2634
01:46:00,520 --> 01:46:01,240
Yay.

2635
01:46:02,080 --> 01:46:03,660
How much is my stack?

2636
01:46:06,220 --> 01:46:09,040
Alright, plus 10, plus 31, plus...

2637
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:09,540
Nice.

2638
01:46:10,180 --> 01:46:10,520
We won.

2639
01:46:10,900 --> 01:46:11,620
Nice.

2640
01:46:17,460 --> 01:46:18,180
Alright.

2641
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:20,500
See guys, I don't...

2642
01:46:20,500 --> 01:46:22,060
Don't steal this.

2643
01:46:22,620 --> 01:46:23,800
Cash out.

2644
01:46:25,700 --> 01:46:26,420
Wow.

2645
01:46:26,820 --> 01:46:29,860
Plus 20 money is 4 per round.

2646
01:46:30,300 --> 01:46:33,020
Re-roll boss blind one time per ante.

2647
01:46:33,300 --> 01:46:34,780
$10 per roll.

2648
01:46:35,500 --> 01:46:37,860
I can get more 7s.

2649
01:46:38,020 --> 01:46:38,480
Wait, is that...

2650
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:39,400
That's good, yeah.

2651
01:46:39,940 --> 01:46:41,960
So I don't have to worry about...

2652
01:46:41,960 --> 01:46:43,820
If it's a bad...

2653
01:46:43,820 --> 01:46:45,980
I can do it.

2654
01:46:46,040 --> 01:46:47,560
I'm gonna buy this voucher.

2655
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:48,600
I'm fucking rich anyway.

2656
01:46:49,460 --> 01:46:52,200
And I'm gonna buy another for more 7s.

2657
01:46:54,760 --> 01:46:55,800
Okay, alright.

2658
01:46:56,220 --> 01:46:57,380
Okay, I'll...

2659
01:46:57,380 --> 01:47:00,000
I'll increase the speed by 2.

2660
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:00,600
I'll...

2661
01:47:03,160 --> 01:47:05,000
Okay, and then...

2662
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:06,360
I can get another 7.

2663
01:47:07,400 --> 01:47:08,580
What the fuck?

2664
01:47:08,900 --> 01:47:10,440
No rank or suit?

2665
01:47:11,340 --> 01:47:12,460
What's that mean?

2666
01:47:14,020 --> 01:47:14,900
Stone cart?

2667
01:47:16,160 --> 01:47:17,580
But I'm gonna skip.

2668
01:47:18,440 --> 01:47:19,340
Yeah, I'm gonna skip.

2669
01:47:19,420 --> 01:47:19,960
That's not a 7.

2670
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:21,780
You know, I have enough money to do another one.

2671
01:47:22,420 --> 01:47:23,820
C'mon, give me a 7.

2672
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:24,680
Wait, what?

2673
01:47:25,480 --> 01:47:27,080
Ace foil cart.

2674
01:47:27,280 --> 01:47:28,560
I don't need that.

2675
01:47:28,680 --> 01:47:29,560
That's not a 7.

2676
01:47:30,300 --> 01:47:31,800
Get out of here.

2677
01:47:32,280 --> 01:47:33,340
You're not a 7.

2678
01:47:35,640 --> 01:47:37,840
I'm gonna throw you away anyway.

2679
01:47:38,420 --> 01:47:39,160
Get out.

2680
01:47:39,640 --> 01:47:40,060
Alright.

2681
01:47:41,240 --> 01:47:42,160
Alright, let's go.

2682
01:47:42,320 --> 01:47:42,840
Next round.

2683
01:47:44,100 --> 01:47:45,060
Next round.

2684
01:47:45,980 --> 01:47:46,420
Alright.

2685
01:47:48,180 --> 01:47:48,760
Skip.

2686
01:47:50,180 --> 01:47:51,140
Alright, nice.

2687
01:47:51,280 --> 01:47:52,260
Oh my God, let's play.

2688
01:47:52,260 --> 01:47:53,720
Alright, 7.

2689
01:47:54,180 --> 01:47:55,580
And then I get a free 7.

2690
01:47:55,820 --> 01:47:56,460
Let's go.

2691
01:48:04,930 --> 01:48:05,970
Okay, so...

2692
01:48:05,970 --> 01:48:06,610
What do I steal?

2693
01:48:09,370 --> 01:48:10,330
Nah, it's fine.

2694
01:48:10,390 --> 01:48:11,050
We don't need to steal.

2695
01:48:11,130 --> 01:48:12,110
I'm just gonna keep it here.

2696
01:48:13,470 --> 01:48:14,510
I'm gonna...

2697
01:48:14,510 --> 01:48:16,130
I want to...

2698
01:48:17,970 --> 01:48:19,830
Wait, but I could get two hearts.

2699
01:48:20,230 --> 01:48:20,990
I'm greedy.

2700
01:48:21,670 --> 01:48:22,930
I'm so greedy.

2701
01:48:22,930 --> 01:48:24,910
Okay, I'm not greedy anymore.

2702
01:48:25,450 --> 01:48:27,850
I'm not greedy anymore.

2703
01:48:28,690 --> 01:48:29,430
I'm not.

2704
01:48:30,510 --> 01:48:32,630
I'll steal it when I need it.

2705
01:48:32,710 --> 01:48:34,230
When I'm desperate, chat.

2706
01:48:34,370 --> 01:48:35,630
I'm not desperate yet.

2707
01:48:35,950 --> 01:48:36,830
Not yet.

2708
01:48:37,370 --> 01:48:38,610
We don't need it yet.

2709
01:48:43,100 --> 01:48:44,480
I don't need to.

2710
01:48:44,680 --> 01:48:46,180
I'm not desperate enough.

2711
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:48,160
Converts up to 3 selected cards.

2712
01:48:48,220 --> 01:48:49,000
No, I don't need clubs.

2713
01:48:49,340 --> 01:48:53,520
Each face card held in hand has a 1 in chance to give you $1.

2714
01:48:54,120 --> 01:48:56,300
Oh, it's a joker card.

2715
01:48:56,360 --> 01:48:56,980
I don't need that.

2716
01:48:57,100 --> 01:48:59,220
What the fuck is going on?

2717
01:49:03,080 --> 01:49:03,960
What the...

2718
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:07,800
You steal the card you're about to copy so you can get a bunch of...

2719
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:09,740
Yeah, but doesn't it stay...

2720
01:49:09,740 --> 01:49:10,420
Oh, okay.

2721
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:14,140
You can steal the card you're about to copy so you can get a bunch of steel.

2722
01:49:14,260 --> 01:49:14,540
Oh.

2723
01:49:15,060 --> 01:49:16,700
Okay, I'll do that next time.

2724
01:49:17,260 --> 01:49:18,640
Buy both packs?

2725
01:49:20,920 --> 01:49:21,360
Arcana?

2726
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:22,300
Okay, I'll do arcana.

2727
01:49:22,640 --> 01:49:25,220
Alright, I'm rich anyway, so it doesn't matter.

2728
01:49:25,400 --> 01:49:26,880
Oh my god, I can destroy...

2729
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:28,480
I can keep destroying.

2730
01:49:29,160 --> 01:49:31,680
Wait, I can keep this...

2731
01:49:31,680 --> 01:49:33,680
Wait, I can convert this into a 7.

2732
01:49:34,840 --> 01:49:35,480
Wait,

2733
01:49:39,040 --> 01:49:40,340
I can enhance.

2734
01:49:42,580 --> 01:49:46,060
Wait, I can empress my 7 of hearts.

2735
01:49:47,200 --> 01:49:47,640
Wait!

2736
01:49:48,220 --> 01:49:51,400
I can put multipliers on my 7s!

2737
01:49:51,680 --> 01:49:52,820
Let's fucking go!

2738
01:49:56,660 --> 01:49:59,420
I can make my 7s even better!

2739
01:50:00,020 --> 01:50:00,660
Let's go!

2740
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:02,760
Okay.

2741
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:04,600
Do it.

2742
01:50:05,240 --> 01:50:06,500
Empress 7 are destroyed.

2743
01:50:08,100 --> 01:50:10,780
I'm gonna enhance my 7s.

2744
01:50:11,280 --> 01:50:13,440
I can have a plus 4 multiplier.

2745
01:50:13,700 --> 01:50:14,780
It's even better.

2746
01:50:15,820 --> 01:50:17,300
Oh my god, I can clone them.

2747
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:18,300
You're so right!

2748
01:50:18,480 --> 01:50:21,480
I can clone my 7s and then have all my...

2749
01:50:21,480 --> 01:50:23,660
I can have them all!

2750
01:50:24,200 --> 01:50:25,100
Alright, you're right.

2751
01:50:25,480 --> 01:50:26,060
That's right.

2752
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:28,460
Torn in top, beautiful 7s.

2753
01:50:28,620 --> 01:50:29,940
I might as well buy this.

2754
01:50:29,980 --> 01:50:31,020
I'm fucking rich anyway.

2755
01:50:32,280 --> 01:50:32,580
Alright.

2756
01:50:33,260 --> 01:50:34,400
4 of a kind?

2757
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:36,400
Oh my god, I can...

2758
01:50:36,400 --> 01:50:38,900
Continue to level my 4 of a kind!

2759
01:50:40,400 --> 01:50:42,400
My super 7s!

2760
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:43,160
Alright.

2761
01:50:44,620 --> 01:50:46,440
Okay, this game is too fast.

2762
01:50:47,560 --> 01:50:48,840
Don't you show your deck.

2763
01:50:49,020 --> 01:50:50,300
It must look funny.

2764
01:50:51,200 --> 01:50:52,680
4 of a kind, baby!

2765
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:54,600
Alright, let's see our deck after this.

2766
01:50:54,900 --> 01:50:55,880
I'm actually curious.

2767
01:51:01,060 --> 01:51:07,600
Oh my god!

2768
01:51:07,600 --> 01:51:07,760
My god!

2769
01:51:07,760 --> 01:51:09,240
Oh, the 7s!

2770
01:51:09,580 --> 01:51:10,860
It's just...

2771
01:51:11,880 --> 01:51:13,140
It's just...

2772
01:51:13,820 --> 01:51:15,600
28 7s!

2773
01:51:16,060 --> 01:51:17,340
Oh my god.

2774
01:51:17,740 --> 01:51:18,820
Okay, next round!

2775
01:51:19,200 --> 01:51:20,340
Next round!

2776
01:51:21,560 --> 01:51:23,880
More 7s than...

2777
01:51:24,940 --> 01:51:26,120
Oh my god!

2778
01:51:26,420 --> 01:51:28,880
Wait, okay, if I do this...

2779
01:51:31,120 --> 01:51:33,460
Wait, how do I... can I use it?

2780
01:51:33,880 --> 01:51:34,780
Do I do that?

2781
01:51:35,240 --> 01:51:36,400
Can I steal this?

2782
01:51:37,280 --> 01:51:37,800
No?

2783
01:51:38,620 --> 01:51:39,360
Not this?

2784
01:51:39,440 --> 01:51:40,340
Which one do I steal?

2785
01:51:42,340 --> 01:51:43,900
Oh, it overwrites?

2786
01:51:46,360 --> 01:51:48,320
Oh, okay, I won't steal it.

2787
01:51:48,380 --> 01:51:49,880
Okay, I'll just use this.

2788
01:51:50,320 --> 01:51:52,840
I'll just play this to get another clone.

2789
01:51:52,840 --> 01:51:54,520
Now I have 29.

2790
01:51:57,860 --> 01:52:04,280
Alright guys, now I have 29... 7 of hearts.

2791
01:52:05,100 --> 01:52:06,500
Oh, should I steal the club?

2792
01:52:09,100 --> 01:52:09,400
Alright.

2793
01:52:14,730 --> 01:52:17,670
Steal a black... well, I already copied it, so I can't.

2794
01:52:18,030 --> 01:52:18,790
I'll do it later.

2795
01:52:19,150 --> 01:52:19,830
I'll do it later.

2796
01:52:20,190 --> 01:52:21,210
I'll do it one day.

2797
01:52:21,530 --> 01:52:22,810
I'll steal it one day.

2798
01:52:23,090 --> 01:52:23,930
Alright, I won.

2799
01:52:26,890 --> 01:52:28,470
1, 2, 3, 4.

2800
01:52:28,770 --> 01:52:29,630
Alright, I won.

2801
01:52:33,950 --> 01:52:34,790
Alright.

2802
01:52:36,930 --> 01:52:38,110
It's over already.

2803
01:52:38,510 --> 01:52:39,370
Oh, nice.

2804
01:52:40,390 --> 01:52:40,890
Alright.

2805
01:52:41,790 --> 01:52:42,710
The club.

2806
01:52:43,970 --> 01:52:44,810
Why?

2807
01:52:45,990 --> 01:52:46,410
Why?

2808
01:52:46,410 --> 01:52:46,850
Why?

2809
01:52:50,730 --> 01:52:52,790
Oh my god, there's a mega.

2810
01:52:52,950 --> 01:52:55,830
Oh my god, there's a mega standard pack.

2811
01:52:56,030 --> 01:52:57,250
Wait, I can buy both.

2812
01:52:57,370 --> 01:52:58,530
I'm gonna buy both.

2813
01:53:02,190 --> 01:53:04,410
Oh my god.

2814
01:53:05,450 --> 01:53:08,390
I'm gonna... I can buy two sevens.

2815
01:53:08,530 --> 01:53:10,110
Oh my god.

2816
01:53:10,590 --> 01:53:13,490
Think of all the sevens I can buy.

2817
01:53:14,510 --> 01:53:16,530
Wait, these are pretty bad, not gonna lie.

2818
01:53:17,090 --> 01:53:18,170
Not gonna lie.

2819
01:53:18,510 --> 01:53:19,430
These are okay.

2820
01:53:20,330 --> 01:53:23,950
Straight flush, two pair, full house.

2821
01:53:25,210 --> 01:53:27,030
I might as well get Uranus, yeah.

2822
01:53:27,310 --> 01:53:29,750
No, I mean, I might as well get the three of a kind.

2823
01:53:30,670 --> 01:53:31,790
Yeah, these all suck.

2824
01:53:32,250 --> 01:53:34,050
Yeah, I'll get three of a kind though.

2825
01:53:34,350 --> 01:53:35,410
Three of a kind is the best one.

2826
01:53:38,390 --> 01:53:41,690
Alright, and now I can buy two sevens.

2827
01:53:45,530 --> 01:53:46,510
There it is.

2828
01:53:48,110 --> 01:53:49,870
There you are.

2829
01:53:51,090 --> 01:53:52,510
There you are.

2830
01:53:53,630 --> 01:53:55,110
Alright, and then I'll leave.

2831
01:53:56,690 --> 01:53:58,550
Wait, that's a wild card?

2832
01:54:01,270 --> 01:54:02,450
Yeah, I'm gonna skip it.

2833
01:54:02,910 --> 01:54:03,750
Alright, there we go.

2834
01:54:03,870 --> 01:54:04,410
Next round.

2835
01:54:05,470 --> 01:54:07,530
First hand is drawn face down?

2836
01:54:07,710 --> 01:54:08,470
What does that mean?

2837
01:54:20,110 --> 01:54:20,710
Discard!

2838
01:54:20,890 --> 01:54:21,330
You're right.

2839
01:54:23,310 --> 01:54:25,030
I'm gonna discard one card.

2840
01:54:25,270 --> 01:54:27,590
Wait, I'll discard one card.

2841
01:54:28,350 --> 01:54:29,910
I'm gonna discard one card.

2842
01:54:30,390 --> 01:54:32,030
And then we'll see how it goes.

2843
01:54:32,830 --> 01:54:33,690
Restore it by rank.

2844
01:54:37,870 --> 01:54:41,570
No, discard five?

2845
01:54:41,690 --> 01:54:44,630
But what if I discard a seven?!

2846
01:54:44,630 --> 01:54:44,950
Guys!

2847
01:54:46,650 --> 01:54:51,970
What if I discard a seven?!

2848
01:54:51,970 --> 01:54:52,310
Seven!

2849
01:54:52,970 --> 01:54:55,270
No, you have so many.

2850
01:54:55,570 --> 01:54:56,150
Fine!

2851
01:55:02,500 --> 01:55:03,760
Discard them all.

2852
01:55:04,620 --> 01:55:06,800
I'll discard them all.

2853
01:55:11,130 --> 01:55:13,990
You have two ten thousand.

2854
01:55:14,150 --> 01:55:15,030
Oh, you're right.

2855
01:55:15,070 --> 01:55:16,070
I can steal it.

2856
01:55:17,410 --> 01:55:19,150
Wait, why won't it let me steal?

2857
01:55:22,870 --> 01:55:24,570
It won't let me do it.

2858
01:55:25,110 --> 01:55:25,410
Huh?

2859
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:30,160
Oh, I have three select.

2860
01:55:30,300 --> 01:55:32,420
Oh wait, when the fuck did I have these guys selected?

2861
01:55:34,640 --> 01:55:37,880
Okay, I'm gonna steal this guy and then I'll copy it.

2862
01:55:41,410 --> 01:55:42,210
A non-seven?

2863
01:55:42,570 --> 01:55:43,790
Wait, I don't know.

2864
01:55:44,410 --> 01:55:46,750
Do I steal a non-seven or a seven?

2865
01:55:57,800 --> 01:55:58,980
I don't know.

2866
01:56:00,340 --> 01:56:01,860
Steal a seven and dupe?

2867
01:56:06,880 --> 01:56:10,120
But it only works if I don't play the seven.

2868
01:56:17,560 --> 01:56:18,360
Oh!

2869
01:56:21,080 --> 01:56:25,260
Okay, I will never play a queen, so I'll steal a queen.

2870
01:56:25,720 --> 01:56:28,580
So I get the 1.5 multiplier.

2871
01:56:33,950 --> 01:56:34,630
I don't know.

2872
01:56:35,030 --> 01:56:35,390
No?

2873
01:56:35,790 --> 01:56:36,890
I don't understand.

2874
01:56:38,950 --> 01:56:40,190
Me no understand.

2875
01:56:41,790 --> 01:56:44,090
I don't understand!

2876
01:56:45,170 --> 01:56:46,210
Brain hurt!

2877
01:56:49,890 --> 01:56:51,190
Oh, I already won.

2878
01:56:53,950 --> 01:56:56,150
Let me copy this real quick though.

2879
01:56:56,510 --> 01:57:00,290
Let me... Let me copy this real quick.

2880
01:57:02,730 --> 01:57:03,190
You want seven?

2881
01:57:03,290 --> 01:57:07,270
You're trying to limit all the cards that aren't... but not use that.

2882
01:57:10,270 --> 01:57:12,950
Stealing, you can use if you're in a pinch.

2883
01:57:14,070 --> 01:57:14,370
Steal?

2884
01:57:14,450 --> 01:57:15,550
Okay, I'm gonna steal it.

2885
01:57:15,730 --> 01:57:16,850
Okay, I'll steal it.

2886
01:57:17,850 --> 01:57:19,690
Or do I steal the diamond?

2887
01:57:20,250 --> 01:57:23,150
I'll steal... Okay, I'll steal the diamond...

2888
01:57:23,150 --> 01:57:25,730
And then... And then I'll copy it.

2889
01:57:30,660 --> 01:57:31,500
Okay.

2890
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:32,580
Yeah.

2891
01:57:33,920 --> 01:57:34,760
Okay.

2892
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:36,580
I'm gonna steal the diamond.

2893
01:57:38,480 --> 01:57:39,340
And then...

2894
01:57:40,100 --> 01:57:41,740
Play the diamond card.

2895
01:57:44,740 --> 01:57:46,420
And then...

2896
01:57:47,160 --> 01:57:49,540
And then throw these guys away.

2897
01:57:58,480 --> 01:58:00,400
And then I have five.

2898
01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:06,540
And then... Alright.

2899
01:58:07,500 --> 01:58:08,960
And then I'll get the...

2900
01:58:08,960 --> 01:58:15,000
And then I got $336,000.

2901
01:58:15,820 --> 01:58:17,540
And then...

2902
01:58:18,200 --> 01:58:21,240
And that's how... That's how it goes.

2903
01:58:21,240 --> 01:58:23,360
That's how it goes here.

2904
01:58:25,760 --> 01:58:28,400
Up to two selected cards by one?

2905
01:58:29,060 --> 01:58:30,280
I can make more sevens.

2906
01:58:32,680 --> 01:58:34,560
Reroll costs $2 less.

2907
01:58:35,280 --> 01:58:36,860
Should I get the Jumbo Arcana pack?

2908
01:58:36,920 --> 01:58:39,420
I might as well get the Jumbo Arcana pack.

2909
01:58:39,860 --> 01:58:40,880
So much money.

2910
01:58:42,860 --> 01:58:44,460
Uh... Double money?

2911
01:58:45,800 --> 01:58:49,580
One in four chance to add to a random joker.

2912
01:58:49,580 --> 01:58:51,420
It's up to two.

2913
01:58:53,180 --> 01:58:55,760
It's up to two random planet cards.

2914
01:58:56,220 --> 01:58:57,060
Is that two cards?

2915
01:58:58,240 --> 01:59:00,320
Wait, I can make more sevens.

2916
01:59:03,380 --> 01:59:04,000
Wait.

2917
01:59:10,620 --> 01:59:12,880
Does it make it better?

2918
01:59:13,700 --> 01:59:15,340
Does it make my...

2919
01:59:16,660 --> 01:59:18,860
I can make more sevens.

2920
01:59:21,340 --> 01:59:22,360
Oh, I can use strength.

2921
01:59:22,440 --> 01:59:22,720
Okay.

2922
01:59:23,280 --> 01:59:25,340
I'll use strength on...

2923
01:59:25,900 --> 01:59:26,420
Six.

2924
01:59:29,400 --> 01:59:31,700
Yeah, I'm gonna increase it on the six.

2925
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:33,480
So it becomes a seven.

2926
01:59:40,030 --> 01:59:42,510
Seven is the correct thing.

2927
01:59:43,090 --> 01:59:43,530
Okay.

2928
01:59:45,130 --> 01:59:48,630
Yeah, but then, like, wouldn't... That wouldn't turn into a seven though.

2929
01:59:50,730 --> 01:59:51,570
Alright, I'll do it.

2930
01:59:53,190 --> 01:59:55,110
Now you shall become a seven.

2931
01:59:57,590 --> 01:59:59,350
And then I'll destroy you too.

2932
02:00:04,410 --> 02:00:07,530
But like, what if I don't get it?

2933
02:00:08,850 --> 02:00:09,370
Guys.

2934
02:00:11,970 --> 02:00:12,130
Will?

2935
02:00:12,810 --> 02:00:17,030
Does it... Can it give me a shitty... Can it give me a shitty outcome, chat?

2936
02:00:23,510 --> 02:00:24,030
No?

2937
02:00:27,620 --> 02:00:29,920
The worst is... Oh, the worst is nothing happened.

2938
02:00:30,020 --> 02:00:30,560
Let's gamble!

2939
02:00:30,560 --> 02:00:36,270
Oh my God!

2940
02:00:41,580 --> 02:00:42,300
Okay.

2941
02:00:44,340 --> 02:00:46,960
Alright, let's move... Open this arcana pack too.

2942
02:00:47,060 --> 02:00:47,660
Let's go!

2943
02:00:50,460 --> 02:00:51,880
Two converts up to three.

2944
02:00:52,520 --> 02:00:53,380
Creates the last.

2945
02:00:53,620 --> 02:00:54,880
Use during this run.

2946
02:00:57,240 --> 02:00:59,180
Wait, I can get another wheel?

2947
02:01:10,990 --> 02:01:11,710
Let's spin!

2948
02:01:11,710 --> 02:01:13,690
Oh, okay, nevermind.

2949
02:01:13,810 --> 02:01:16,190
I didn't... I didn't get... I didn't get lucky again.

2950
02:01:16,470 --> 02:01:16,790
That's fine.

2951
02:01:19,930 --> 02:01:20,910
That's fine.

2952
02:01:21,130 --> 02:01:22,550
I don't need it again.

2953
02:01:24,350 --> 02:01:24,930
Alright.

2954
02:01:26,170 --> 02:01:27,170
There we go.

2955
02:01:27,930 --> 02:01:28,350
Nice.

2956
02:01:32,450 --> 02:01:33,030
Nope.

2957
02:01:33,290 --> 02:01:34,090
That's fine.

2958
02:01:34,210 --> 02:01:35,070
I don't need it.

2959
02:01:35,750 --> 02:01:37,790
I didn't need it at all.

2960
02:01:38,490 --> 02:01:39,170
Alright, goodbye.

2961
02:01:39,170 --> 02:01:39,510
Goodbye.

2962
02:01:41,010 --> 02:01:42,210
Oh, I could get more.

2963
02:01:43,170 --> 02:01:43,610
Goodbye.

2964
02:01:44,490 --> 02:01:45,730
Oh my God!

2965
02:01:48,110 --> 02:01:50,030
Do I... Oh, I'll steal you.

2966
02:01:50,770 --> 02:01:51,190
Wait, no.

2967
02:01:51,270 --> 02:01:52,390
I have to get another copy though.

2968
02:01:52,410 --> 02:01:53,650
I don't have a copy yet, guys.

2969
02:01:56,150 --> 02:01:56,590
Nope!

2970
02:01:56,710 --> 02:01:58,270
I wanna wait until I get a copy!

2971
02:01:58,550 --> 02:01:59,590
I don't have a copy!

2972
02:02:04,260 --> 02:02:06,100
I don't have a copy though!

2973
02:02:08,160 --> 02:02:08,600
Yeah.

2974
02:02:11,680 --> 02:02:13,400
I'll just... I'll do 4 of a kind.

2975
02:02:13,640 --> 02:02:14,500
Like, I feel like...

2976
02:02:15,080 --> 02:02:17,500
I have a level 4 4 of a kind, so I...

2977
02:02:19,040 --> 02:02:21,900
I feel like... I feel like...

2978
02:02:21,900 --> 02:02:24,460
Oh wait, what's my multi... Oh yeah, my multiplier is better.

2979
02:02:24,600 --> 02:02:25,180
4 of a kind.

2980
02:02:25,340 --> 02:02:26,540
Yeah, I'm just gonna get 4 of a kind.

2981
02:02:30,360 --> 02:02:33,480
I have a fucking x4 4 of a kind.

2982
02:02:38,220 --> 02:02:39,220
Alright, nice.

2983
02:02:41,700 --> 02:02:43,240
4 is better than 5.

2984
02:02:43,300 --> 02:02:43,900
Let's go.

2985
02:02:45,100 --> 02:02:45,620
Yeah!

2986
02:02:45,920 --> 02:02:46,440
Cash out!

2987
02:02:46,500 --> 02:02:47,100
Cash out!

2988
02:02:49,900 --> 02:02:50,980
Contains plus 2.

2989
02:02:51,100 --> 02:02:51,300
Alright.

2990
02:02:51,480 --> 02:02:53,500
Jumbo... Jumbo Celestial pack!

2991
02:02:53,560 --> 02:02:54,220
Let's open!

2992
02:02:57,080 --> 02:02:58,160
Oh my God!

2993
02:02:58,340 --> 02:02:59,900
Another flush 5!

2994
02:03:01,820 --> 02:03:02,680
Let's go!

2995
02:03:05,600 --> 02:03:06,880
Level up 3 of a kind.

2996
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:07,600
Level up a high card.

2997
02:03:07,760 --> 02:03:09,760
Oh, but I can level up a high card.

2998
02:03:10,520 --> 02:03:11,040
Wait.

2999
02:03:12,560 --> 02:03:12,940
Pluto though.

3000
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:14,040
I always do Pluto.

3001
02:03:15,080 --> 02:03:18,240
Guys, do I do... Guys, I can't... I don't know!

3002
02:03:18,380 --> 02:03:20,160
I always play Pluto every time!

3003
02:03:26,880 --> 02:03:27,400
Pluto!

3004
02:03:27,560 --> 02:03:28,480
I always do Pluto!

3005
02:03:29,600 --> 02:03:31,300
Yeah, I think high card is better.

3006
02:03:31,560 --> 02:03:32,940
I always do Pluto anyway.

3007
02:03:34,540 --> 02:03:35,900
But big number!

3008
02:03:38,040 --> 02:03:41,560
No, I think Pluto is because I always do Pluto, so it's fine.

3009
02:03:41,860 --> 02:03:42,200
7!

3010
02:03:44,140 --> 02:03:44,580
What?

3011
02:03:44,680 --> 02:03:45,400
We trigger this card?

3012
02:03:45,540 --> 02:03:45,740
No.

3013
02:03:46,660 --> 02:03:47,460
Fuck that shit.

3014
02:03:47,700 --> 02:03:48,080
Next round.

3015
02:03:48,540 --> 02:03:49,280
It's not 7.

3016
02:03:49,400 --> 02:03:50,020
I don't care.

3017
02:03:51,060 --> 02:03:51,840
Alright, nice.

3018
02:03:51,980 --> 02:03:54,040
I'll steal... Oh, I got this steal.

3019
02:03:54,740 --> 02:03:55,080
Nice.

3020
02:03:55,200 --> 02:03:56,620
I'll... Let me... I need to clone this.

3021
02:03:56,720 --> 02:03:59,500
Sorry, I'm not stealing it because I need to clone this real quick.

3022
02:03:59,860 --> 02:04:05,340
I... I need... I need... I need to... I need to clone this real quick.

3023
02:04:06,700 --> 02:04:07,560
Alright, nice.

3024
02:04:07,700 --> 02:04:08,720
And then I just win.

3025
02:04:10,220 --> 02:04:10,660
Wait.

3026
02:04:10,720 --> 02:04:11,180
Oh, wait, wait.

3027
02:04:11,260 --> 02:04:12,520
I got to discard this first.

3028
02:04:12,660 --> 02:04:15,960
Let me discard these two so I can get... Oh my god!

3029
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:17,100
I get another...

3030
02:04:21,740 --> 02:04:23,940
Wait, I get another... Wait!

3031
02:04:24,260 --> 02:04:25,180
Let's fucking go!

3032
02:04:25,480 --> 02:04:26,600
I get another Pluto!

3033
02:04:36,210 --> 02:04:37,290
I'm using the Pluto.

3034
02:04:37,390 --> 02:04:38,070
No, I'm not.

3035
02:04:38,150 --> 02:04:38,770
I don't care.

3036
02:04:39,150 --> 02:04:41,270
I like a Pluto and then I win.

3037
02:04:43,710 --> 02:04:44,590
Let's go.

3038
02:04:49,870 --> 02:04:50,430
Yay!

3039
02:04:54,090 --> 02:04:55,210
Never punished.

3040
02:04:56,290 --> 02:05:00,710
Never pu... She is going to win a Pluto.

3041
02:05:02,310 --> 02:05:03,990
Wait, I can get books!

3042
02:05:04,630 --> 02:05:05,190
Sevens!

3043
02:05:05,190 --> 02:05:05,710
Let's go!

3044
02:05:06,170 --> 02:05:06,790
Oh my god.

3045
02:05:07,110 --> 02:05:07,790
Okay, no.

3046
02:05:07,870 --> 02:05:08,710
I don't need these.

3047
02:05:08,890 --> 02:05:13,370
Okay, I have so much money that I'm just going to open packs until I get a seven.

3048
02:05:13,970 --> 02:05:14,530
No.

3049
02:05:15,270 --> 02:05:15,610
Skip.

3050
02:05:15,610 --> 02:05:17,510
Alright, what's my deck like?

3051
02:05:18,510 --> 02:05:19,390
What is it?

3052
02:05:19,390 --> 02:05:20,210
I have 34.

3053
02:05:21,510 --> 02:05:23,730
Probability-wise, I think I got this.

3054
02:05:26,250 --> 02:05:27,230
Should I re-roll?

3055
02:05:27,510 --> 02:05:28,210
I can re-roll.

3056
02:05:28,430 --> 02:05:28,930
I don't mind.

3057
02:05:30,790 --> 02:05:31,570
Check the half-joker.

3058
02:05:32,130 --> 02:05:34,610
Plus 20 multi-up played hand contains three or few...

3059
02:05:35,510 --> 02:05:37,250
Oh my god, Jesus.

3060
02:05:37,930 --> 02:05:39,070
Wait, I can... You know what?

3061
02:05:39,130 --> 02:05:39,470
Fuck it.

3062
02:05:39,510 --> 02:05:40,070
Let's re-roll.

3063
02:05:40,650 --> 02:05:41,730
Level up straight.

3064
02:05:42,450 --> 02:05:45,870
Adds the number of times poker hand has been played this run.

3065
02:05:46,630 --> 02:05:48,450
Level up... Wait, re-roll.

3066
02:05:48,510 --> 02:05:48,890
Oh, wait.

3067
02:05:48,930 --> 02:05:49,890
I should have bought the voucher.

3068
02:05:50,050 --> 02:05:50,550
Fuck it.

3069
02:05:50,590 --> 02:05:50,910
Whatever.

3070
02:05:52,150 --> 02:05:56,770
I feel like I don't really need... Oh, it's too late.

3071
02:05:57,010 --> 02:05:58,670
I feel like I don't really need it.

3072
02:06:03,110 --> 02:06:04,330
Level up straight.

3073
02:06:04,530 --> 02:06:05,290
Oh, it's straight again.

3074
02:06:05,490 --> 02:06:07,490
I feel like I never used it so I keep forgetting.

3075
02:06:07,630 --> 02:06:08,450
Oh, I don't need it.

3076
02:06:08,990 --> 02:06:10,290
I'll just buy a voucher.

3077
02:06:10,350 --> 02:06:11,230
I'm so fucking rich.

3078
02:06:11,290 --> 02:06:12,530
I don't really care anymore.

3079
02:06:21,130 --> 02:06:22,330
Alright, skip.

3080
02:06:22,770 --> 02:06:23,790
Skip all.

3081
02:06:25,110 --> 02:06:26,530
Replace it with space?

3082
02:06:28,430 --> 02:06:29,370
Pump the DNA.

3083
02:06:29,930 --> 02:06:32,070
He's been with me for so long.

3084
02:06:33,630 --> 02:06:36,650
Guys, he's been with me for so long.

3085
02:06:41,550 --> 02:06:42,570
Skip all.

3086
02:06:44,650 --> 02:06:46,450
Yeah, I want DNA's better.

3087
02:06:46,970 --> 02:06:47,410
Oh, shit.

3088
02:06:47,530 --> 02:06:50,070
One random joker disabled every hand.

3089
02:06:50,790 --> 02:06:51,810
Oh, no.

3090
02:06:59,420 --> 02:06:59,860
Re-roll?

3091
02:07:00,040 --> 02:07:01,220
How do I re-roll this?

3092
02:07:02,100 --> 02:07:02,960
Re-roll boss?

3093
02:07:10,140 --> 02:07:11,840
Do I tank those?

3094
02:07:13,660 --> 02:07:14,500
It's fine.

3095
02:07:14,600 --> 02:07:15,600
It should be fine.

3096
02:07:15,780 --> 02:07:17,960
I have so many insane multipliers.

3097
02:07:18,440 --> 02:07:20,020
I don't think it really matters.

3098
02:07:20,760 --> 02:07:25,300
Because it's one random joker, right?

3099
02:07:26,220 --> 02:07:26,600
Yeah.

3100
02:07:27,660 --> 02:07:32,920
Bro, I have like... I have so many jokers.

3101
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:33,940
I'm fine with that.

3102
02:07:34,040 --> 02:07:34,720
Alright, okay.

3103
02:07:34,840 --> 02:07:36,240
I just don't use the hearts.

3104
02:07:36,840 --> 02:07:38,120
It's that easy.

3105
02:07:41,830 --> 02:07:43,970
I'll discard all these guys.

3106
02:07:45,430 --> 02:07:49,250
And then... I'll build this.

3107
02:07:49,530 --> 02:07:50,390
Woah, woah, woah, woah.

3108
02:07:54,930 --> 02:07:59,030
I'll just make a copy now because I'm worried it's gonna do... Yeah.

3109
02:07:59,970 --> 02:08:02,350
I'll copy this and then I'll be fine.

3110
02:08:03,010 --> 02:08:04,530
I'm gonna clone this right now.

3111
02:08:06,090 --> 02:08:07,310
Play flesh 5, win?

3112
02:08:07,650 --> 02:08:15,250
Yeah, but if I play this and then like... I just disable... I get this undisabled and then... Oh, I just play and I win?

3113
02:08:15,470 --> 02:08:15,770
Okay.

3114
02:08:22,090 --> 02:08:23,870
No, just win.

3115
02:08:24,150 --> 02:08:24,470
Okay.

3116
02:08:24,470 --> 02:08:24,550
Okay.

3117
02:08:30,550 --> 02:08:32,350
Like, I don't care.

3118
02:08:32,710 --> 02:08:34,250
Just win the game.

3119
02:08:36,010 --> 02:08:37,450
I did it.

3120
02:08:37,750 --> 02:08:38,950
Alright, that was great.

3121
02:08:39,510 --> 02:08:47,710
That was my first... That was literally my first time playing and I won the game.

3122
02:08:54,370 --> 02:08:56,230
Oh my god.

3123
02:08:56,690 --> 02:08:57,470
Oh my god.

3124
02:08:58,650 --> 02:08:59,250
Yay!

3125
02:09:02,450 --> 02:09:03,510
Guys, wow.

3126
02:09:03,790 --> 02:09:08,410
I thought this... Wait, I thought this game was supposed to be alright.

3127
02:09:11,530 --> 02:09:12,430
Keep it.

3128
02:09:12,710 --> 02:09:13,990
Now keep going.

3129
02:09:14,170 --> 02:09:17,170
Guys, if I keep going, we'll never stop.

3130
02:09:17,170 --> 02:09:19,810
We're never gonna stop.

3131
02:09:20,310 --> 02:09:26,250
I feel like my 7s are... It's just gonna keep going forever.

3132
02:09:27,270 --> 02:09:29,350
Doki, read the seed.

3133
02:09:29,750 --> 02:09:30,490
What's the seed?

3134
02:09:30,590 --> 02:09:31,170
Where is it?

3135
02:09:31,290 --> 02:09:32,450
Oh, it's a tutorial.

3136
02:09:33,090 --> 02:09:34,230
Hey guys, I did it.

3137
02:09:35,570 --> 02:09:37,770
Alright, you will stop.

3138
02:09:38,090 --> 02:09:38,810
Oh, it scales?

3139
02:09:39,290 --> 02:09:40,550
Okay, let's start in endless mode.

3140
02:09:40,610 --> 02:09:41,050
Do I just click?

3141
02:09:41,410 --> 02:09:41,990
There you go.

3142
02:09:42,090 --> 02:09:43,830
And that is why it stops you.

3143
02:09:43,970 --> 02:09:46,170
I promise you, it won't.

3144
02:09:46,610 --> 02:09:50,210
True victory is written in scientific notation.

3145
02:09:50,790 --> 02:09:52,550
Sombra, thank you for the super chat.

3146
02:09:52,650 --> 02:09:53,770
Thank you, thank you.

3147
02:09:54,270 --> 02:09:56,910
Aphelion, thank you for the 777.

3148
02:09:57,750 --> 02:09:58,790
The true victory.

3149
02:09:59,190 --> 02:10:03,670
This is the most balutro run I've seen from the tutorial seed.

3150
02:10:06,130 --> 02:10:07,970
First run, take it higher.

3151
02:10:08,190 --> 02:10:09,450
Thank you for the super chat, Tsunami.

3152
02:10:09,570 --> 02:10:10,530
Thank you, thank you.

3153
02:10:10,950 --> 02:10:13,070
Justin, thank you for the Hakasupa.

3154
02:10:13,270 --> 02:10:13,870
Thank you, thank you.

3155
02:10:14,090 --> 02:10:23,230
Do I still get to keep my deck in endless mode?

3156
02:10:25,630 --> 02:10:28,910
Guys, bro, I've never won a run and you win on your first.

3157
02:10:29,070 --> 02:10:29,930
What is this tree?

3158
02:10:31,390 --> 02:10:32,750
Okay, let's go.

3159
02:10:32,930 --> 02:10:33,690
I'll fight.

3160
02:10:33,890 --> 02:10:34,170
Yeah.

3161
02:10:35,170 --> 02:10:35,690
Nice.

3162
02:10:35,970 --> 02:10:37,190
How do you beat the game?

3163
02:10:38,750 --> 02:10:39,790
You don't.

3164
02:10:39,990 --> 02:10:40,750
Don't you.

3165
02:10:41,210 --> 02:10:42,670
Permanently gain plus one.

3166
02:10:42,770 --> 02:10:43,890
Oh, I like that.

3167
02:10:43,990 --> 02:10:46,530
I get one plus one discard each round?

3168
02:10:49,350 --> 02:10:50,810
Wait, five of a kind?

3169
02:10:51,630 --> 02:10:52,850
Isn't five of a kind...

3170
02:10:53,970 --> 02:10:59,970
Five cards with the same... Wait, isn't five of a kind... I could just have sevens?

3171
02:11:01,290 --> 02:11:01,770
Wait!

3172
02:11:02,190 --> 02:11:03,790
Alright, I'm gonna buy this voucher.

3173
02:11:04,490 --> 02:11:05,670
Wait, Planet X first.

3174
02:11:05,810 --> 02:11:07,130
Yeah, I'm gonna buy and use.

3175
02:11:07,310 --> 02:11:07,530
Yeah.

3176
02:11:08,070 --> 02:11:09,830
I'm gonna get Planet X so I can get...

3177
02:11:11,970 --> 02:11:15,770
And then I'll buy the voucher so I can get an extra discard.

3178
02:11:16,550 --> 02:11:17,010
And then...

3179
02:11:18,670 --> 02:11:21,450
I'll get an Arcana pack because I have the money anyway.

3180
02:11:22,170 --> 02:11:22,770
And then...

3181
02:11:24,150 --> 02:11:25,510
Oh my god!

3182
02:11:27,770 --> 02:11:32,790
And then I'll use the four so I can get another Planet X.

3183
02:11:34,910 --> 02:11:39,110
And then I'll use Planet X again.

3184
02:11:39,670 --> 02:11:44,390
And then I'll buy another Celestial pack.

3185
02:11:44,950 --> 02:11:45,770
And then...

3186
02:11:48,050 --> 02:11:51,210
And then... Oh, I get to level up four of a kind again.

3187
02:11:51,270 --> 02:11:51,810
Let's go.

3188
02:11:52,090 --> 02:11:52,590
Let's go.

3189
02:11:52,750 --> 02:11:53,350
Four of a kind.

3190
02:11:53,770 --> 02:11:54,310
Let's...

3191
02:11:57,670 --> 02:11:58,190
Alright.

3192
02:11:58,190 --> 02:11:59,730
Okay, a hundred and ten.

3193
02:12:00,590 --> 02:12:00,990
Alright.

3194
02:12:02,010 --> 02:12:05,030
Let's see, I'll get rid of all these guys fast.

3195
02:12:05,570 --> 02:12:07,210
And then...

3196
02:12:07,630 --> 02:12:10,750
Oh, I could steal another... Oh my god, let's steal another one.

3197
02:12:11,310 --> 02:12:11,770
Fuck it.

3198
02:12:12,270 --> 02:12:14,770
Let's just steal another...

3199
02:12:18,810 --> 02:12:20,610
No, why would I steal a heart?

3200
02:12:20,810 --> 02:12:22,930
I'm gonna use the heart anyway, right?

3201
02:12:27,330 --> 02:12:28,510
But why a heart?

3202
02:12:28,850 --> 02:12:31,870
Because I'm gonna use... In case you get six.

3203
02:12:32,670 --> 02:12:35,030
What the fuck am I gonna do with a six?

3204
02:12:39,530 --> 02:12:43,110
Steal a heart for big... Yeah, but I have to not use a heart though.

3205
02:12:45,530 --> 02:12:47,870
Oh, so I can keep... Oh!

3206
02:12:49,250 --> 02:12:49,710
Okay.

3207
02:12:50,170 --> 02:12:50,710
I'll steal it.

3208
02:12:50,810 --> 02:12:51,550
I'll steal a heart.

3209
02:12:51,710 --> 02:12:54,210
I see... I see what you mean.

3210
02:12:59,270 --> 02:13:00,150
And then...

3211
02:13:00,150 --> 02:13:01,970
In case I have six, you're right.

3212
02:13:02,010 --> 02:13:04,290
In case I have six sevens, you're so right.

3213
02:13:05,050 --> 02:13:05,490
Nice.

3214
02:13:07,610 --> 02:13:08,050
Yeah.

3215
02:13:10,410 --> 02:13:11,330
One, two, three.

3216
02:13:13,190 --> 02:13:15,230
Let's get... Let's have more sevens in here.

3217
02:13:15,410 --> 02:13:16,150
Alright, that's cool.

3218
02:13:16,150 --> 02:13:16,270
No.

3219
02:13:22,230 --> 02:13:23,670
No, I'll take it.

3220
02:13:24,150 --> 02:13:24,530
Yeah.

3221
02:13:24,990 --> 02:13:25,690
Let's go.

3222
02:13:27,990 --> 02:13:29,030
That's fine with me.

3223
02:13:29,990 --> 02:13:32,390
That's fine with me.

3224
02:13:34,350 --> 02:13:35,830
Oh shit, I accidentally used a steal.

3225
02:13:35,970 --> 02:13:36,270
Whoops.

3226
02:13:36,430 --> 02:13:37,450
I already won.

3227
02:13:38,290 --> 02:13:39,130
It's fine.

3228
02:13:39,450 --> 02:13:41,310
I literally got 530.

3229
02:13:43,850 --> 02:13:44,770
There we go.

3230
02:13:45,990 --> 02:13:48,710
Your entire card, poker hand, plus one hand size.

3231
02:13:48,910 --> 02:13:50,270
Oh shit, Jumbo Arcana.

3232
02:13:52,390 --> 02:13:56,610
Hermit, Wheel of Fortune, Star, converts up to... Converts up to three cards.

3233
02:13:56,710 --> 02:13:58,210
Oh, I don't have more hearts.

3234
02:13:58,350 --> 02:13:59,090
God damn it.

3235
02:14:00,010 --> 02:14:01,630
I... Oh my god.

3236
02:14:01,990 --> 02:14:02,850
Wait, fuck.

3237
02:14:02,970 --> 02:14:03,210
Okay.

3238
02:14:03,910 --> 02:14:07,950
Oh no, but then I have... I get to make more sevens.

3239
02:14:07,990 --> 02:14:08,270
Shit.

3240
02:14:09,650 --> 02:14:12,270
But what about sevens?

3241
02:14:14,550 --> 02:14:15,330
You're right.

3242
02:14:15,430 --> 02:14:16,010
You're right.

3243
02:14:16,050 --> 02:14:16,890
It's all about gambling.

3244
02:14:17,090 --> 02:14:18,730
You're so right, guys.

3245
02:14:25,030 --> 02:14:27,710
But Wheel is for content.

3246
02:14:32,290 --> 02:14:32,890
Alright.

3247
02:14:32,890 --> 02:14:33,950
Alright, Pluto.

3248
02:14:34,210 --> 02:14:35,330
It's time for more Pluto.

3249
02:14:36,410 --> 02:14:40,830
I'm gonna have like one card that would just let me... All face cards.

3250
02:14:41,150 --> 02:14:43,550
All face cards are... Wait.

3251
02:14:43,990 --> 02:14:46,050
Face cards are kings and queens, right?

3252
02:14:46,570 --> 02:14:47,790
Oh, that doesn't matter to me.

3253
02:14:49,430 --> 02:14:51,890
That doesn't fucking matter to me.

3254
02:14:52,250 --> 02:14:53,990
Oh, I got to play this hand.

3255
02:14:54,290 --> 02:14:57,130
And then I clone another one.

3256
02:14:57,510 --> 02:14:58,070
Wow.

3257
02:15:00,210 --> 02:15:03,910
And then I just get rid of these guys.

3258
02:15:04,050 --> 02:15:06,550
And then I get rid of these guys.

3259
02:15:06,570 --> 02:15:08,510
And then I get rid of these guys.

3260
02:15:08,650 --> 02:15:09,470
And then I win.

3261
02:15:14,830 --> 02:15:16,370
66k for FC.

3262
02:15:16,810 --> 02:15:17,310
Pluto!

3263
02:15:17,530 --> 02:15:17,970
Pluto!

3264
02:15:18,250 --> 02:15:18,650
Pluto!

3265
02:15:18,910 --> 02:15:19,350
Pluto!

3266
02:15:19,630 --> 02:15:19,950
Pluto!

3267
02:15:21,730 --> 02:15:24,370
I can't get over this.

3268
02:15:24,830 --> 02:15:27,030
Bro, what the fuck?

3269
02:15:28,850 --> 02:15:32,450
Bro, like, I don't know how to feel about her.

3270
02:15:33,770 --> 02:15:36,770
I told you Pluto's a real planet!

3271
02:15:39,770 --> 02:15:40,590
Oh my god!

3272
02:15:40,950 --> 02:15:41,850
I can make it!

3273
02:15:42,730 --> 02:15:43,430
Okay, wait.

3274
02:15:43,870 --> 02:15:45,430
This is two selected cards.

3275
02:15:45,590 --> 02:15:49,790
Wait, I can turn my sevens into bonus cards!

3276
02:15:51,150 --> 02:15:52,570
Wait, I can multi.

3277
02:15:53,170 --> 02:15:53,690
Wait.

3278
02:15:53,690 --> 02:15:56,690
Wait, but Empress though!

3279
02:15:57,550 --> 02:15:58,870
Yeah, but I... Three.

3280
02:15:59,150 --> 02:16:01,390
I can only... I only have one, two.

3281
02:16:02,470 --> 02:16:03,450
Okay, you're right.

3282
02:16:04,030 --> 02:16:07,010
And then... And then I'll convert.

3283
02:16:11,810 --> 02:16:12,650
More hearts.

3284
02:16:12,730 --> 02:16:13,210
You're right.

3285
02:16:13,350 --> 02:16:13,950
More hearts.

3286
02:16:17,170 --> 02:16:20,250
These are all kind of... Oh, more hearts though.

3287
02:16:20,310 --> 02:16:20,950
And the five?

3288
02:16:21,110 --> 02:16:22,170
Okay, we'll do it.

3289
02:16:22,170 --> 02:16:25,210
But then I can have plus enhances too.

3290
02:16:25,490 --> 02:16:27,750
But I can have multipliers though.

3291
02:16:28,610 --> 02:16:31,830
You need more hearts for... Go for the five later for strength.

3292
02:16:31,870 --> 02:16:32,810
Oh, you're true.

3293
02:16:33,050 --> 02:16:33,830
But the multi!

3294
02:16:37,090 --> 02:16:38,510
You want more hearts?

3295
02:16:38,910 --> 02:16:40,110
But you only... You're right.

3296
02:16:40,190 --> 02:16:40,950
I only want hearts.

3297
02:16:41,030 --> 02:16:42,170
You're fucking right, guys.

3298
02:16:42,790 --> 02:16:43,310
You're right.

3299
02:16:44,370 --> 02:16:45,750
You're so right, guys.

3300
02:16:45,830 --> 02:16:46,910
I need to buy another seven.

3301
02:16:47,110 --> 02:16:47,910
I'm running out.

3302
02:16:48,570 --> 02:16:49,350
God damn it.

3303
02:16:51,270 --> 02:16:53,360
Guys, I'm running out of sevens.

3304
02:16:56,090 --> 02:16:57,590
You don't understand.

3305
02:16:58,190 --> 02:16:59,090
I need more.

3306
02:16:59,610 --> 02:17:01,070
I need more.

3307
02:17:03,090 --> 02:17:04,790
Guys, you don't understand.

3308
02:17:05,930 --> 02:17:07,410
I'm running out.

3309
02:17:07,570 --> 02:17:09,390
I need more sevens.

3310
02:17:10,290 --> 02:17:11,050
Alright, nice.

3311
02:17:11,090 --> 02:17:11,490
I win.

3312
02:17:14,770 --> 02:17:17,150
Oh no, the plant went out.

3313
02:17:20,110 --> 02:17:22,870
I'm quite fond of the palatial flush.

3314
02:17:24,330 --> 02:17:24,930
Nice.

3315
02:17:28,570 --> 02:17:29,570
I'm riding.

3316
02:17:29,710 --> 02:17:32,230
I'm riding it all the way to the bank!

3317
02:17:32,530 --> 02:17:34,030
Plus one consumable slot.

3318
02:17:34,410 --> 02:17:35,410
Wait, is it this one?

3319
02:17:35,490 --> 02:17:36,030
The top right?

3320
02:17:38,130 --> 02:17:39,130
What the fuck?

3321
02:17:43,610 --> 02:17:44,730
I'll buy that.

3322
02:17:47,250 --> 02:17:47,730
Alright.

3323
02:17:48,710 --> 02:17:49,790
Now I have three.

3324
02:17:50,150 --> 02:17:51,930
And then you know what that means.

3325
02:17:54,870 --> 02:17:55,350
Misprint?

3326
02:17:55,750 --> 02:17:56,650
Do I get this?

3327
02:17:57,130 --> 02:17:58,870
But I don't want to sell it in my cards.

3328
02:18:01,310 --> 02:18:02,250
I can't.

3329
02:18:02,250 --> 02:18:03,490
These are all too good.

3330
02:18:04,690 --> 02:18:06,850
Nah, all of it is too good.

3331
02:18:07,470 --> 02:18:08,750
I need more sevens though.

3332
02:18:09,090 --> 02:18:10,850
I'm fucking run... God damn it.

3333
02:18:10,890 --> 02:18:12,230
Why is it giving me tens?

3334
02:18:12,230 --> 02:18:15,570
I don't need tens.

3335
02:18:18,170 --> 02:18:19,070
No!

3336
02:18:23,260 --> 02:18:26,200
Why does it keep giving me tens?

3337
02:18:26,460 --> 02:18:27,540
I don't understand.

3338
02:18:30,280 --> 02:18:31,180
Alright.

3339
02:18:32,140 --> 02:18:33,980
How much do I make now?

3340
02:18:34,140 --> 02:18:35,560
Seventy seven thousand...

3341
02:18:35,560 --> 02:18:37,860
Five hundred and sixty.

3342
02:18:37,860 --> 02:18:38,120
Let's see.

3343
02:18:43,080 --> 02:18:45,060
It's getting... Okay, nevermind.

3344
02:18:45,200 --> 02:18:45,400
I won.

3345
02:18:52,080 --> 02:18:54,060
It's getting real... Oh, nevermind.

3346
02:18:54,280 --> 02:18:54,920
I just won.

3347
02:18:56,600 --> 02:18:59,000
Wait, I didn't win instantly?

3348
02:19:00,040 --> 02:19:01,460
What is this?

3349
02:19:02,400 --> 02:19:02,880
What?

3350
02:19:03,160 --> 02:19:03,840
Oh, nevermind.

3351
02:19:03,920 --> 02:19:04,580
I won again.

3352
02:19:04,580 --> 02:19:05,220
Oh my...

3353
02:19:05,220 --> 02:19:06,840
No.

3354
02:19:09,240 --> 02:19:10,340
Nevermind.

3355
02:19:13,100 --> 02:19:16,100
That's why you need steals.

3356
02:19:17,120 --> 02:19:18,860
This is where it starts.

3357
02:19:22,230 --> 02:19:25,900
Oh my God, it's ramping up like fucking crazy.

3358
02:19:26,380 --> 02:19:28,200
Holy shit.

3359
02:19:30,680 --> 02:19:32,020
Wow, guys, that's shit.

3360
02:19:32,860 --> 02:19:34,820
It's actually... It's getting harder.

3361
02:19:35,420 --> 02:19:38,400
Oh, the ante is actually going up now.

3362
02:19:38,680 --> 02:19:39,200
Guys!

3363
02:19:39,920 --> 02:19:40,440
Guys!

3364
02:19:40,900 --> 02:19:42,980
I think... Guys!

3365
02:19:46,900 --> 02:19:48,240
Oh my God.

3366
02:19:50,500 --> 02:19:54,420
Guys, are you telling me seven is not the... No, seven is always the answer.

3367
02:19:54,760 --> 02:19:56,400
No, they're all wrong.

3368
02:19:56,620 --> 02:19:58,020
Seven is always the answer.

3369
02:19:58,460 --> 02:19:59,380
Get in there, Pluto.

3370
02:19:59,860 --> 02:20:02,180
Get in there.

3371
02:20:03,960 --> 02:20:05,920
Oh, I could've strengthened!

3372
02:20:06,240 --> 02:20:08,200
I forgot about the strength!

3373
02:20:09,880 --> 02:20:11,500
Oh my God.

3374
02:20:12,200 --> 02:20:12,940
I forgot.

3375
02:20:13,340 --> 02:20:14,000
I forgot.

3376
02:20:14,640 --> 02:20:15,420
Oh no.

3377
02:20:16,220 --> 02:20:17,000
I forgot.

3378
02:20:17,900 --> 02:20:18,900
I'm so sad.

3379
02:20:21,980 --> 02:20:23,960
Oh my God.

3380
02:20:26,660 --> 02:20:27,080
Okay.

3381
02:20:28,580 --> 02:20:29,120
Okay.

3382
02:20:29,180 --> 02:20:29,680
Okay, I multiply.

3383
02:20:30,360 --> 02:20:31,720
I got the multiplier.

3384
02:20:31,920 --> 02:20:32,300
It's okay.

3385
02:20:33,180 --> 02:20:35,120
I always have the multiplier.

3386
02:20:35,380 --> 02:20:37,080
I just...

3387
02:20:37,080 --> 02:20:37,860
Here we go.

3388
02:20:38,520 --> 02:20:39,920
I can do this.

3389
02:20:42,500 --> 02:20:44,000
Get rid of all of you.

3390
02:20:47,660 --> 02:20:48,740
And then...

3391
02:20:48,740 --> 02:20:50,060
I could get another heart.

3392
02:20:50,320 --> 02:20:52,460
There is a chance I'll get another heart.

3393
02:20:53,420 --> 02:20:55,260
This isn't looking too good, guys.

3394
02:20:57,400 --> 02:20:58,020
Nevermind.

3395
02:21:09,720 --> 02:21:10,340
Nevermind.

3396
02:21:10,780 --> 02:21:13,020
It always is looking good for Doki.

3397
02:21:23,320 --> 02:21:25,280
Oh yeah, another seven.

3398
02:21:25,680 --> 02:21:27,320
I'll just discard this just in case.

3399
02:21:28,340 --> 02:21:29,260
Let's discard this.

3400
02:21:29,640 --> 02:21:30,140
There we go.

3401
02:21:35,540 --> 02:21:37,320
Seven for the W.

3402
02:21:37,500 --> 02:21:39,500
How long will it take me?

3403
02:21:40,260 --> 02:21:44,220
How long is it gonna take me to the finish line?

3404
02:21:48,240 --> 02:21:51,500
You just can't keep getting away with this.

3405
02:21:52,140 --> 02:21:54,060
Yes, I will.

3406
02:21:55,740 --> 02:21:57,040
That's one hand size.

3407
02:21:58,600 --> 02:21:59,480
Oh my God.

3408
02:21:59,620 --> 02:22:00,860
Bro, the antes is getting higher.

3409
02:22:00,920 --> 02:22:02,040
I'm a little scared, guys.

3410
02:22:02,180 --> 02:22:06,200
I'm getting a little scared, guys.

3411
02:22:07,200 --> 02:22:09,020
Add negative to a random joker.

3412
02:22:10,960 --> 02:22:13,080
Destroy five random cards in hand.

3413
02:22:14,540 --> 02:22:15,200
Oh my God.

3414
02:22:15,300 --> 02:22:16,520
No, they're all sevens.

3415
02:22:16,940 --> 02:22:18,720
Wait, what do I use for this?

3416
02:22:21,720 --> 02:22:22,200
Ecto?

3417
02:22:22,280 --> 02:22:23,100
But which one?

3418
02:22:27,060 --> 02:22:27,540
Skip?

3419
02:22:33,780 --> 02:22:35,840
Oh, it's random?

3420
02:22:44,580 --> 02:22:48,080
Why are your cards all seven?

3421
02:22:55,590 --> 02:22:57,310
It's risky.

3422
02:22:57,730 --> 02:22:59,690
It is very risky.

3423
02:23:15,120 --> 02:23:16,220
It's fine!

3424
02:23:16,560 --> 02:23:17,200
Go!

3425
02:23:21,800 --> 02:23:22,990
It's fine!

3426
02:23:24,070 --> 02:23:25,710
I'm all about the risk.

3427
02:23:28,130 --> 02:23:32,490
I gotta believe in my- Whoa, what the fuck is this?

3428
02:23:32,750 --> 02:23:37,030
Dude, this card is hella- It's always held in hand at the end of- Oh, fuck it.

3429
02:23:37,050 --> 02:23:37,450
Let's go.

3430
02:23:37,830 --> 02:23:40,250
I mean, it's fucking- Whoa, I'll take that.

3431
02:23:44,030 --> 02:23:45,010
Yeah, I might as well.

3432
02:23:45,110 --> 02:23:46,210
I already bought it anyway.

3433
02:23:46,450 --> 02:23:47,610
Like, I already bought it.

3434
02:23:49,310 --> 02:23:51,630
Oh, buy another- Oh, whoops.

3435
02:23:51,630 --> 02:23:56,670
After play or discard, always draw three cards.

3436
02:24:02,320 --> 02:24:04,280
What does this mean?

3437
02:24:04,940 --> 02:24:06,040
This one sucks?

3438
02:24:06,480 --> 02:24:06,720
Alright.

3439
02:24:07,880 --> 02:24:09,620
Start with zero discards.

3440
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:15,160
Okay, this- That's fine.

3441
02:24:15,300 --> 02:24:16,360
I'll just clone a seven.

3442
02:24:25,040 --> 02:24:27,000
Guys, it's GG, guys.

3443
02:24:27,120 --> 02:24:30,880
It was- Alright, guys.

3444
02:24:31,840 --> 02:24:34,080
It was nice knowing you all.

3445
02:24:34,380 --> 02:24:37,620
It was- It was nice knowing you all again.

3446
02:24:39,240 --> 02:24:40,000
Guys,

3447
02:24:46,480 --> 02:24:51,560
we had a good- We had a good run.

3448
02:24:52,420 --> 02:24:59,400
We had- Guys, we had- We had- We had a good run, guys.

3449
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:05,600
Okay, if I play bad cards, it'll be fine.

3450
02:25:06,660 --> 02:25:08,640
I'll just play all these bad cards.

3451
02:25:13,160 --> 02:25:13,700
Yeah.

3452
02:25:14,960 --> 02:25:16,000
It'll be fine.

3453
02:25:17,100 --> 02:25:18,070
And then, like...

3454
02:25:20,480 --> 02:25:21,020
Truly...

3455
02:25:21,020 --> 02:25:21,880
Oh, no.

3456
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:24,860
Four of a kind.

3457
02:25:25,180 --> 02:25:26,220
Guys, four of a kind!

3458
02:25:31,010 --> 02:25:31,650
Four of a kind!

3459
02:25:31,650 --> 02:25:32,490
Can we save this?

3460
02:25:34,250 --> 02:25:35,390
Save this seal?

3461
02:25:35,590 --> 02:25:36,790
But four of a kind!

3462
02:25:39,570 --> 02:25:40,810
Get flush five?

3463
02:25:40,910 --> 02:25:42,010
But then I have to use these.

3464
02:25:42,610 --> 02:25:43,790
I have to use the pair.

3465
02:25:44,450 --> 02:25:45,730
Is it worth it?

3466
02:25:50,400 --> 02:25:53,680
But will I- Do I win?

3467
02:25:57,930 --> 02:25:58,250
Okay.

3468
02:25:59,050 --> 02:25:59,390
Maybe.

3469
02:25:59,390 --> 02:25:59,430
Maybe.

3470
02:26:06,220 --> 02:26:07,240
Oh my God.

3471
02:26:07,560 --> 02:26:08,180
Is that enough?

3472
02:26:10,100 --> 02:26:11,820
This is my last one.

3473
02:26:13,200 --> 02:26:13,960
Oh, that's enough.

3474
02:26:13,980 --> 02:26:14,440
It's fine.

3475
02:26:15,800 --> 02:26:16,680
I just got saved.

3476
02:26:19,220 --> 02:26:20,460
I made it.

3477
02:26:25,880 --> 02:26:31,560
Yeah, I made it.

3478
02:26:32,700 --> 02:26:33,340
Yippee!

3479
02:26:34,400 --> 02:26:35,510
I made it.

3480
02:26:37,460 --> 02:26:39,680
The dream is still alive!

3481
02:26:40,460 --> 02:26:43,060
How does she keep getting away with this?

3482
02:26:43,140 --> 02:26:44,360
Oh my God, that's more money!

3483
02:26:44,720 --> 02:26:45,280
Wait, what?

3484
02:26:46,040 --> 02:26:48,920
Go up to minus $20 in debt?

3485
02:26:50,160 --> 02:26:51,260
Wait, I don't wanna go in debt.

3486
02:26:51,740 --> 02:26:52,820
Wait, plus one card shop.

3487
02:26:53,880 --> 02:26:54,780
Oh, buy the voucher.

3488
02:26:54,880 --> 02:26:55,680
Yeah, I'll buy it.

3489
02:27:01,700 --> 02:27:03,420
Oh, they're selling money?

3490
02:27:08,330 --> 02:27:12,610
I can't believe your luck is driving me insane.

3491
02:27:14,450 --> 02:27:15,010
Wait,

3492
02:27:21,270 --> 02:27:21,790
I should get...

3493
02:27:23,170 --> 02:27:26,070
Wait, is this free money?

3494
02:27:26,590 --> 02:27:27,890
Does this give me money?

3495
02:27:29,130 --> 02:27:31,050
I can't tell what this is.

3496
02:27:35,590 --> 02:27:36,150
No?

3497
02:27:36,810 --> 02:27:37,370
Oh, no.

3498
02:27:37,490 --> 02:27:38,990
Okay, I'll get free money first.

3499
02:27:40,330 --> 02:27:41,590
And I'll use it.

3500
02:27:43,350 --> 02:27:45,050
Oh, and then I'll buy this.

3501
02:27:49,620 --> 02:27:52,940
I'll buy this, and then I'll get all jokers, and then I'll have more money.

3502
02:27:57,210 --> 02:27:57,650
No?

3503
02:27:57,990 --> 02:27:59,050
Oh, don't buy it?

3504
02:27:59,090 --> 02:27:59,370
Okay.

3505
02:28:01,830 --> 02:28:03,370
Oh, it's a bad joker.

3506
02:28:03,510 --> 02:28:04,850
Okay, I'll just get money then.

3507
02:28:05,250 --> 02:28:06,170
And I'll reroll.

3508
02:28:07,610 --> 02:28:09,770
Doubles all listed probabilities.

3509
02:28:10,270 --> 02:28:11,670
1 in 3 to 2 to 3.

3510
02:28:12,110 --> 02:28:13,510
Do I have probabilities?

3511
02:28:14,690 --> 02:28:18,270
Adds the number of times Poker Hand has been played this run.

3512
02:28:21,690 --> 02:28:25,070
Earn an extra $1 of interest for every $5 you have.

3513
02:28:25,170 --> 02:28:26,230
Wait, they're all good.

3514
02:28:26,390 --> 02:28:26,870
Wait, space?

3515
02:28:29,650 --> 02:28:30,790
Is it this one?

3516
02:28:33,290 --> 02:28:33,970
To the moon?

3517
02:28:34,430 --> 02:28:35,330
To the moon!

3518
02:28:40,830 --> 02:28:41,050
Alright.

3519
02:28:44,500 --> 02:28:45,140
Okay.

3520
02:28:46,340 --> 02:28:48,940
I'll get a... Oh, I'll get more Celestial Pack.

3521
02:28:50,060 --> 02:28:51,320
Go to the far left?

3522
02:28:51,400 --> 02:28:51,620
Okay.

3523
02:28:53,660 --> 02:28:55,240
I'll buy another Celestial Pack.

3524
02:28:56,700 --> 02:28:57,680
Oh, nice.

3525
02:28:58,120 --> 02:28:58,760
More Aeris.

3526
02:29:06,160 --> 02:29:06,800
Yippee!

3527
02:29:07,280 --> 02:29:09,180
What's my card looking like now?

3528
02:29:09,460 --> 02:29:10,640
Oh, that's pretty nice.

3529
02:29:10,640 --> 02:29:13,140
That's a pretty nice looking deck.

3530
02:29:13,540 --> 02:29:14,700
Alright, let's go!

3531
02:29:18,620 --> 02:29:19,020
Alright.

3532
02:29:21,320 --> 02:29:22,080
Let's see.

3533
02:29:22,180 --> 02:29:23,300
I don't think I need any of this.

3534
02:29:23,720 --> 02:29:25,060
I don't know if I need probability.

3535
02:29:29,160 --> 02:29:30,460
Look at the... Oh, you're right.

3536
02:29:30,480 --> 02:29:31,560
I gotta look at the boss.

3537
02:29:33,160 --> 02:29:34,260
Alright, go next.

3538
02:29:35,420 --> 02:29:36,740
Oh my God!

3539
02:29:38,900 --> 02:29:40,240
Guys, I think it's over.

3540
02:29:40,240 --> 02:29:43,280
I think it's over.

3541
02:29:44,240 --> 02:29:46,240
I... I don't...

3542
02:29:50,800 --> 02:29:55,420
Seven, you've been with me for so long.

3543
02:29:55,620 --> 02:29:57,240
Seven, it's...

3544
02:29:57,240 --> 02:30:00,920
Oh, seven to seven to the seven run.

3545
02:30:01,500 --> 02:30:05,300
Oh, seven to the seven run.

3546
02:30:11,370 --> 02:30:14,370
I don't know if I should risk trying to get another heart.

3547
02:30:14,370 --> 02:30:16,190
I don't know.

3548
02:30:16,230 --> 02:30:19,630
I don't know if I should get a flush or...

3549
02:30:19,630 --> 02:30:20,850
Oh, seven.

3550
02:30:22,050 --> 02:30:24,190
You did your job.

3551
02:30:26,190 --> 02:30:29,870
Oh, you did your job, seven.

3552
02:30:30,490 --> 02:30:32,750
You were good to me.

3553
02:30:32,750 --> 02:30:32,910
You were good to me.

3554
02:30:42,920 --> 02:30:44,800
Nah, we're... I can't.

3555
02:30:44,900 --> 02:30:45,860
There's no way.

3556
02:30:46,460 --> 02:30:48,300
Defeated by a seven.

3557
02:30:49,500 --> 02:30:50,660
Wait, what's better?

3558
02:30:50,860 --> 02:30:51,860
Four or... Okay.

3559
02:30:52,280 --> 02:30:54,540
Four of a kind, 190, flush five.

3560
02:30:54,840 --> 02:30:55,740
Oh my God.

3561
02:30:55,800 --> 02:30:58,320
If it was flush five, we would have...

3562
02:30:58,320 --> 02:30:59,580
Okay, four of a kind.

3563
02:31:00,440 --> 02:31:04,860
Then you play with one other unscroll... Okay, we gotta... We can only play this.

3564
02:31:06,040 --> 02:31:07,000
Four of a kind.

3565
02:31:08,720 --> 02:31:10,240
With the same rank.

3566
02:31:10,380 --> 02:31:12,400
Wait, is this...

3567
02:31:14,600 --> 02:31:15,720
Five of a kind.

3568
02:31:16,020 --> 02:31:17,660
Oh, the multiplier.

3569
02:31:19,240 --> 02:31:19,840
Alright.

3570
02:31:20,540 --> 02:31:21,140
Oh, seven.

3571
02:31:23,080 --> 02:31:24,100
Oh, seven.

3572
02:31:27,140 --> 02:31:29,960
Wait, space adds into... Oh my God, you're right!

3573
02:31:30,020 --> 02:31:31,360
I forgot about the space!

3574
02:31:34,480 --> 02:31:35,080
Wait.

3575
02:31:37,720 --> 02:31:39,160
Wait, do I put five?

3576
02:31:40,420 --> 02:31:41,540
Five for... Okay.

3577
02:31:41,880 --> 02:31:43,040
Maybe this is it.

3578
02:31:44,020 --> 02:31:46,180
Maybe the supernova's gonna hit it.

3579
02:31:47,040 --> 02:31:47,540
Maybe.

3580
02:31:49,220 --> 02:31:51,820
Oh my God, look at all the multipl... Oh my God, it's keep going.

3581
02:31:52,120 --> 02:31:53,780
Oh my God, it... Oh no, it's over.

3582
02:31:53,860 --> 02:31:54,080
Goodbye.

3583
02:31:55,200 --> 02:31:56,240
It's over.

3584
02:31:58,840 --> 02:31:59,360
Guys.

3585
02:32:00,020 --> 02:32:00,360
Guys.

3586
02:32:01,420 --> 02:32:02,860
It's not enough.

3587
02:32:03,820 --> 02:32:05,600
It's actually not.

3588
02:32:05,600 --> 02:32:06,900
It's so over.

3589
02:32:08,440 --> 02:32:10,920
It's so over.

3590
02:32:11,460 --> 02:32:11,940
Unless...

3591
02:32:12,420 --> 02:32:14,500
Unless everybody...

3592
02:32:15,380 --> 02:32:17,380
No, it's so over.

3593
02:32:17,580 --> 02:32:18,780
I don't think I can get...

3594
02:32:19,260 --> 02:32:22,560
It's never... It's never been...

3595
02:32:22,560 --> 02:32:25,920
Guys, I don't even think a flush five would save us.

3596
02:32:26,500 --> 02:32:29,540
You must keep trying.

3597
02:32:34,180 --> 02:32:34,940
Wait.

3598
02:32:34,940 --> 02:32:36,000
It's over, guys.

3599
02:32:36,300 --> 02:32:37,840
I'll discard the two.

3600
02:32:38,620 --> 02:32:41,680
I'll discard the three.

3601
02:32:42,580 --> 02:32:43,340
Wait.

3602
02:32:43,820 --> 02:32:47,160
If I do... Wait, I can do two pairs.

3603
02:32:47,740 --> 02:32:50,100
And then maybe I'll get another heart.

3604
02:32:50,720 --> 02:32:52,540
And then maybe...

3605
02:32:53,180 --> 02:32:54,160
Oh my God.

3606
02:32:54,840 --> 02:32:57,920
We can get... We might be able to get...

3607
02:32:57,920 --> 02:33:01,240
We might be... We might be able to get a flush five.

3608
02:33:01,760 --> 02:33:02,780
Right here.

3609
02:33:03,120 --> 02:33:03,980
Right now.

3610
02:33:04,420 --> 02:33:05,820
Oh my God.

3611
02:33:09,840 --> 02:33:11,420
Guys, I think it's over.

3612
02:33:11,540 --> 02:33:12,920
I don't think it's gonna...

3613
02:33:13,720 --> 02:33:16,340
I don't think we're gonna get seven million.

3614
02:33:17,340 --> 02:33:18,840
I don't... Okay, yeah.

3615
02:33:19,180 --> 02:33:22,000
Guys, we've had a good run.

3616
02:33:22,300 --> 02:33:24,680
We've had a good run.

3617
02:33:24,680 --> 02:33:28,700
The seven, seven, seven run.

3618
02:33:30,340 --> 02:33:32,640
Oh, seven to the sevens.

3619
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:35,020
It was a good run, guys.

3620
02:33:35,240 --> 02:33:36,680
Oh, seven...

3621
02:33:38,280 --> 02:33:41,380
Seven died to the seven million.

3622
02:33:42,100 --> 02:33:46,540
Only the seven million could kill the seven run.

3623
02:33:46,540 --> 02:33:47,260
It...

3624
02:33:51,360 --> 02:33:56,620
All good things must come to an end.

3625
02:34:00,240 --> 02:34:01,520
Oh, that was fun.

3626
02:34:01,640 --> 02:34:04,360
Oh, I can't... I can't believe...

3627
02:34:04,360 --> 02:34:07,960
I can't believe I first tried it as a creator.

3628
02:34:08,060 --> 02:34:10,980
I heard, like, people were struggling so much.

3629
02:34:12,620 --> 02:34:14,800
We were struggling in the tutorial.

3630
02:34:15,580 --> 02:34:17,740
Like, for the first, like, first trying tutorial.

3631
02:34:18,260 --> 02:34:19,620
I can't believe I made it.

3632
02:34:19,780 --> 02:34:24,420
I can't believe I got it through.

3633
02:34:25,080 --> 02:34:28,040
Oh, I had very good luck.

3634
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:35,940
Oh my God, Kaz, thank you for the super chat.

3635
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:36,960
Thank you, thank you.

3636
02:34:38,160 --> 02:34:39,460
You were a good seven.

3637
02:34:39,640 --> 02:34:40,160
Real good.

3638
02:34:40,160 --> 02:34:43,180
Maybe even the best 07, everybody.

3639
02:34:44,220 --> 02:34:47,100
07, the luckiest run of my life.

3640
02:34:47,220 --> 02:34:48,140
Thank you for the super chat.

3641
02:34:48,240 --> 02:34:49,240
Thank you, thank you.

3642
02:34:49,720 --> 02:34:51,340
Grunga, thank you for the super chat.

3643
02:34:51,460 --> 02:34:52,560
Thank you, thank you.

3644
02:34:52,660 --> 02:34:53,700
Wait, ununlocked stuff?

3645
02:34:53,780 --> 02:34:54,480
What did I unlock?

3646
02:34:55,020 --> 02:34:55,880
Plus one hen.

3647
02:34:56,160 --> 02:34:59,360
Oh, I unlocked... Oh, that's where the rogue light is.

3648
02:35:00,640 --> 02:35:02,720
Oh, wait, I get better cards?

3649
02:35:03,380 --> 02:35:04,780
Wait, what the fuck?

3650
02:35:06,400 --> 02:35:07,760
Wait, that's crazy.

3651
02:35:07,760 --> 02:35:14,760
Wait, I got through all of that without even getting any of the...

3652
02:35:20,460 --> 02:35:22,180
Pyro, thank you for the super chat.

3653
02:35:22,260 --> 02:35:23,340
Thank you, thank you.

3654
02:35:23,440 --> 02:35:25,360
Without playing a straight... Wait, that's me.

3655
02:35:26,060 --> 02:35:28,240
I just played one number and that's it.

3656
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:30,300
Unlocked like half the...

3657
02:35:30,300 --> 02:35:31,760
I won a run, let's go.

3658
02:35:31,860 --> 02:35:33,840
Start one with a crystal ball voucher.

3659
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:36,460
Nice.

3660
02:35:36,900 --> 02:35:39,720
Max up the interest per round earnings for 10 consecutive rounds.

3661
02:35:41,440 --> 02:35:44,640
Have at least 30 cards of heart suited in your deck.

3662
02:35:44,780 --> 02:35:45,240
That's me.

3663
02:35:45,560 --> 02:35:47,300
One or two chance for play cards to give you...

3664
02:35:47,300 --> 02:35:49,340
Oh my god, I could have had it all.

3665
02:35:51,760 --> 02:35:53,760
Enhance 16 cards in your multi.

3666
02:35:53,860 --> 02:35:54,680
You have at least 16...

3667
02:35:54,680 --> 02:35:55,320
What the fuck?

3668
02:35:55,380 --> 02:35:56,400
I could have had all of this.

3669
02:35:56,820 --> 02:35:58,340
I could... What do you mean?

3670
02:35:58,480 --> 02:36:00,400
I just had a baby deck.

3671
02:36:01,280 --> 02:36:02,780
Each played ace of spades gives...

3672
02:36:02,780 --> 02:36:05,620
Oh my god, all I had was an actual baby deck.

3673
02:36:07,480 --> 02:36:08,280
That's crazy.

3674
02:36:09,060 --> 02:36:11,040
What the fuck was my luck?

3675
02:36:11,840 --> 02:36:13,020
Phillip, thank you for the super chat.

3676
02:36:13,080 --> 02:36:13,820
Thank you, thank you.

3677
02:36:14,060 --> 02:36:15,000
Happy new year, Doki.

3678
02:36:15,120 --> 02:36:18,040
You've been popping up like crazy ever since your comeback stream last year.

3679
02:36:18,300 --> 02:36:20,780
And the amazing heights you've been reaching just keep on coming.

3680
02:36:21,120 --> 02:36:23,620
Here's to many more awesome memories in 2025.

3681
02:36:24,360 --> 02:36:25,400
Thank you for the super chat.

3682
02:36:25,460 --> 02:36:26,660
Thank you, thank you, Phillip.

3683
02:36:27,440 --> 02:36:28,900
My mom, thank you for the super chat.

3684
02:36:29,020 --> 02:36:29,140
Thank you.

3685
02:36:29,200 --> 02:36:31,680
This is the power of the top 500 Marble Rival player.

3686
02:36:31,680 --> 02:36:33,620
Guys, what's the cutoff?

3687
02:36:34,100 --> 02:36:35,440
I have an hour left.

3688
02:36:35,820 --> 02:36:37,280
Guys, what's the cutoff?

3689
02:36:37,740 --> 02:36:39,180
Did I make it?

3690
02:36:39,700 --> 02:36:40,400
Did I...

3691
02:36:43,500 --> 02:36:45,280
Am I fine?

3692
02:36:45,660 --> 02:36:46,940
Did I make it?

3693
02:36:48,060 --> 02:36:49,180
Oh, I'm fine.

3694
02:36:49,260 --> 02:36:49,980
Okay, that's cool.

3695
02:36:50,160 --> 02:36:51,300
Alright, I'm alright now.

3696
02:36:51,680 --> 02:36:53,360
I'm alright.

3697
02:36:54,180 --> 02:36:57,880
Why did you bring up Marble Rivals?

3698
02:36:58,380 --> 02:37:00,940
Because I need to know if I made it.

3699
02:37:00,940 --> 02:37:02,980
I need to know.

3700
02:37:05,400 --> 02:37:08,900
There's an hour left of the season.

3701
02:37:10,420 --> 02:37:10,940
Alright.

3702
02:37:12,420 --> 02:37:14,040
Greg, thank you for the super chat.

3703
02:37:14,140 --> 02:37:14,820
Thank you, thank you.

3704
02:37:14,920 --> 02:37:15,700
Great first round.

3705
02:37:15,800 --> 02:37:17,800
0-7 to the sevens.

3706
02:37:17,920 --> 02:37:19,940
Wait, there's still three hours left.

3707
02:37:20,440 --> 02:37:21,340
Oh my god.

3708
02:37:21,700 --> 02:37:22,280
Oh, I'm ranked.

3709
02:37:22,400 --> 02:37:22,600
Okay.

3710
02:37:23,640 --> 02:37:26,700
Cutoff is 5-0-3-6.

3711
02:37:26,800 --> 02:37:27,240
Oh, wait.

3712
02:37:27,740 --> 02:37:29,140
No, I'm not 5-0.

3713
02:37:29,320 --> 02:37:30,260
Oh, I'm still 2.

3714
02:37:30,260 --> 02:37:31,220
Okay, that's fine.

3715
02:37:31,300 --> 02:37:32,120
Alright, we're okay.

3716
02:37:32,560 --> 02:37:33,320
I'm okay.

3717
02:37:33,420 --> 02:37:34,080
Okay, sorry guys.

3718
02:37:34,200 --> 02:37:38,020
I just freaked out a little bit because the season ends in like an hour.

3719
02:37:38,180 --> 02:37:39,020
So I died.

3720
02:37:42,300 --> 02:37:45,220
I just have to be sure, okay?

3721
02:37:45,420 --> 02:37:51,660
I just have to be sure if I have to put up Marble Rivals.

3722
02:37:54,500 --> 02:37:55,680
Alright, anyway guys.

3723
02:37:57,480 --> 02:37:59,660
That was a crazy run.

3724
02:37:59,660 --> 02:38:09,440
I didn't expect to beat the game in one try.

3725
02:38:09,840 --> 02:38:10,520
Like the tutorial.

3726
02:38:10,880 --> 02:38:13,120
I guess like the first run in one try.

3727
02:38:13,300 --> 02:38:15,080
I legitimately did not know what I was doing.

3728
02:38:15,600 --> 02:38:19,580
But then the seven gods graced us with the power of seven.

3729
02:38:20,300 --> 02:38:24,320
And we made it so far.

3730
02:38:24,320 --> 02:38:32,240
We made it so fucking far with just seven.

3731
02:38:32,740 --> 02:38:34,700
So 0-7 everybody.

3732
02:38:34,860 --> 02:38:35,640
That was fun though.

3733
02:38:35,700 --> 02:38:36,900
That was actually a really fun game.

3734
02:38:37,180 --> 02:38:38,280
I definitely enjoyed it.

3735
02:38:38,320 --> 02:38:40,820
I think like it's definitely more fun because I'm playing it with you guys too.

3736
02:38:40,920 --> 02:38:43,300
Like I'm learning the game like as I go along.

3737
02:38:43,640 --> 02:38:45,580
So I thought it was incredibly seven.

3738
02:38:45,780 --> 02:38:46,900
What a fucking run though.

3739
02:38:46,900 --> 02:38:53,240
I feel like if it was anyone that had to experience all of that.

3740
02:38:53,620 --> 02:38:55,380
It's funny that it was me.

3741
02:38:55,700 --> 02:39:06,320
Like I feel like it's very like of course it was me that had to experience this for my very first bilateral run.

3742
02:39:10,400 --> 02:39:13,400
Anyway, I'm gonna call it here.

3743
02:39:14,520 --> 02:39:17,380
Everyone, I feel like I should end it at a high note.

3744
02:39:17,480 --> 02:39:17,940
I don't know.

3745
02:39:18,080 --> 02:39:20,840
I feel like the seven run was pure cinema.

3746
02:39:21,200 --> 02:39:27,240
And I feel like I should end that in a high note with the most pure cinema run I've ever had.

3747
02:39:27,340 --> 02:39:28,280
Which was my first run.

3748
02:39:33,200 --> 02:39:34,600
MrBrokenBot, thank you for the super chat.

3749
02:39:34,700 --> 02:39:35,460
Thank you.

3750
02:39:35,560 --> 02:39:37,760
No, no one game of Marble Rivals.

3751
02:39:37,760 --> 02:39:40,480
If I'm safe, then we'll do a Marble...

3752
02:39:40,480 --> 02:39:43,420
We have a Marble Rivals stream at 1 in the morning, guys.

3753
02:39:43,880 --> 02:39:45,700
No Marble Rivals right now.

3754
02:39:45,800 --> 02:39:49,340
We have another stream today at 1 AM, guys.

3755
02:39:49,400 --> 02:39:51,040
We don't need to do another one right now.

3756
02:39:51,220 --> 02:39:52,340
I'm gonna take a nap.

3757
02:39:53,380 --> 02:39:55,300
But I had so much fun.

3758
02:39:55,420 --> 02:39:57,480
I hope you guys had a lot of fun watching.

3759
02:40:00,280 --> 02:40:03,800
As always, everybody stay hydrated.

3760
02:40:04,300 --> 02:40:05,100
Posture check.

3761
02:40:05,100 --> 02:40:07,620
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3762
02:40:07,880 --> 02:40:12,540
And if you did that for me, head to bed, cause you deserve it.

3763
02:40:12,700 --> 02:40:14,400
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

3764
02:40:14,780 --> 02:40:15,800
Bye, guys.

3765
02:40:16,340 --> 02:40:16,820
Bye.
