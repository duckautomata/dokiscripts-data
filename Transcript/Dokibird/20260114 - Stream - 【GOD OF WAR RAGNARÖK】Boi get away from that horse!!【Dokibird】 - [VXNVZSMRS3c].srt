00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,400
Hello, everyone.

2
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,220
Hello, hello.

3
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,140
Sorry for being a little late.

4
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:49,740
I was downloading the Marvel Rivals preview build for
tomorrow.

5
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,240
Yes, whoa, the biggest plot twist of our lives.

6
00:03:53,580 --> 00:04:00,880
The special stream on Twitch with drops is gonna be Marvel
Rivals.

7
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,960
Who could have expected this at all?

8
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,360
Oh, my God.

9
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,600
I know it's crazy.

10
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:19,020
But yes, tomorrow I will be streaming the season 6 preview
of Deadpool.

11
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,460
Yes, of Deadpool for season 6.

12
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:29,220
And we're going to be doing a special early access preview
with a bunch of other streamers tomorrow.

13
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,680
I will say Deadpool is fucking hard.

14
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,160
I like look tested.

15
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:46,140
I won't reveal everything because it's a you know gotta save
it for tomorrow but um for those who don't didn't see the

16
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:55,900
the trailers for it he is tank dps and support no gamut's
fucking easy he's such a fucking easy character it's just

17
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:07,220
literally cute to win um but yeah so he's tank dps and
support and he has like a skill tree for each role I thought

18
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:15,880
the was for like like to determine what role you're playing
but during the character select uh you can like you can pick

19
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:26,200
which Deadpool do you want to pick and also the the XP that
you get from uh the XP that you get transfers over to the

20
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:33,480
role so it's really funny because I was like oh shit like
it's like you you know if your team was like well we're

21
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:39,620
lacking support let me just swap to Deadpool as Oh, we need
another tank.

22
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,540
Don't worry.

23
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:44,180
I'll just swap to Deadpool as a tank and you keep your XP.

24
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:50,080
Yeah, you can just swap from DPS, but you have to be in the,
you have to be in the hero select for that.

25
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,180
You can't just swap randomly in the middle of the fight.

26
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:57,800
You have to actually be in the, in spawn to swap between,
like, between roles.

27
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:15,420
That's, I think the craziest part is that I was testing this
out and I was like thinking, Oh, um, oh, like, uh, if he is,

28
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:24,700
like, for each role, does that mean when you ban Deadpool,
you only ban the specific Deadpool for that role?

29
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:32,060
So then, because, like, I got thinking, I was like, if you
ban Deadpool, do you ban all the Deadpools, or do you ban

30
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,880
the Deadpool of each role?

31
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,380
It's of each role.

32
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:47,660
It's like, I got to, guys you if you use all three all three
of your bands you can ban Deadpool but you have to use all

33
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:56,820
three of your band yeah you have to use all three bands to
ban the entire character because if you ban if you ban tank

34
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:07,460
Deadpool then like you only ban tank Deadpool so you have to
ban tank Deadpool support Deadpool and DPS Deadpool to ban

35
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:19,400
the entire Deadpool I know I'll show you guys it tomorrow
it's looking so it's so fucking funny I was like oh my god

36
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:32,140
what that shit is crazy he's like you can never get rid of
him he truly is unbattable um but yes anyway more details

37
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:40,580
about Deadpool tomorrow but um oh also my team okay it's
pretty Because it's like, I thought it was really funny.

38
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,620
So this is the team I'm going to be going against, guys.

39
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,860
Okay, let me grab.

40
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,680
I snipped it because I thought it was really funny.

41
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,380
I won't say why.

42
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,640
I just thought it was really funny.

43
00:07:52,040 --> 00:08:00,080
So the team I'm playing against is Bougar, XQC, Moxie, J3,
Guru, and KG.

44
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:07,160
But then on my team, it's Shroud, Gael, Saipé, Flats, and
KC.

45
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,300
So I was like, that's funny.

46
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,200
That's really funny.

47
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,820
Doesn't matter which team I'm in.

48
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:27,000
It doesn't matter which team I'm in.

49
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,120
There's always going to be something.

50
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:36,140
I would have liked to be on Moxie's team, though.

51
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:46,880
moxie's team is definitely the the vibes team and then my
team is like the super serious people like saipe is so

52
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:55,700
fucking serious too um yeah i would have loved to be on yeah
moxie's team because moxie's team sounds really fun i think

53
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:08,780
my team sounds really try yeah yeah i think it's my team is
the sweaty no cop like yes only cop like if you use voice

54
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:20,460
chat it's only gonna be comm's voice chat type deal yeah not
actually no moxie moxie j3 boker um even xqc they're all

55
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:28,900
pretty fucking fun play people to play like like on a team
because i've done i've done sponsored streams um and rivals

56
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:38,120
with xqc with boker with uh moxie and with j3 and they're
all like super super vibes people they're all just like

57
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:46,020
content type people if you guys ever see my other marvel
arrivals uh sponsored oh yeah no we like i it that it's like

58
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:55,000
it's like pretty fucking silly we'd be like what are you
saying excuse me like it would just be like we just be

59
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:05,180
picking on him and stuff and it's just fun in general yeah
um if you guys ever see my have a sponsor stream it was i've

60
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:14,540
been on a team with these people before like individually
and like or like together um and stuff um and then uh but i

61
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:21,680
i know i've been on a team with gail and um gail he's like a
super serious player and i know cype is also an incredibly

62
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:28,640
serious player too because he's he's like the number one
he's number one two three and four and five oh yeah By the

63
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,860
way, it's really funny.

64
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:35,280
Saipay was number one, two, three, four, and five in Marvel
Rivals.

65
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:44,500
And people got really mad that he took up too many of the
top 500, the top 10 leaderboards of Marvel Rivals that

66
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:53,320
NetEase fucking demoted four of his accounts or like five of
his accounts back to like Eternity or some shit because

67
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,000
they're like, they're like, no, too many accounts in top.

68
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,260
No, they didn't ban his all the accounts.

69
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:06,040
They deranked his alt accounts back to the bottom of
eternity so he couldn't be top 500 again And you know what

70
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,600
he did?

71
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:17,060
He got back he got back ranked two three four and five He's
like all right bet I'll do it all over again And then he

72
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:22,020
fucking got back two three four and five Within like a
couple of days.

73
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:33,400
I know it's like there was no point There's no point in like
deranking him like you can't stop him like but yes i'm a

74
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:41,360
little nervous about tomorrow only because like um all the
players on my team are super serious and like that makes me

75
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:50,800
very nervous when everyone is super serious so i hope people
would be chill i hope i hope it'll be i hope um um my team

76
00:11:50,800 --> 00:12:00,640
will be chill in the end too and just you know fuck around
too fuck around but also not get rolled That's all I hope

77
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:00,960
for.

78
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:04,460
I hope we can fuck around.

79
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,280
But also not get hard diff.

80
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,380
That's my goal here.

81
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,840
Because I personally think Moxie's team is definitely the
stronger team.

82
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:24,640
Because they have more people that play rivals regularly.

83
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,220
Plus it's top 500.

84
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,260
I think Moxie's team.

85
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:35,160
team has more top 500 players than my team because like I
don't play rivals as much anymore um because of my busy

86
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:44,920
schedule so I really do appreciate rival devs for inviting
me um uh for inviting me to the sponsors as well um and uh

87
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:54,260
and like I am a little nervous because their team is so
stacked their team is like a lot more stacked than us bro so

88
00:12:54,260 --> 00:13:05,020
I can't carry all of us guys He is, guys, Rupert win my team
during the, what was it, the seven hours of hell where we

89
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:11,700
only play three games and we beat Sipe's team and we
technically, like he was, his team is ranked one, two,

90
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,580
three, and four and five.

91
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,000
And then my team still beat his team.

92
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,560
He can't carry all of us.

93
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:28,000
Like, we still were able to beat him, guys.

94
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:37,880
even though he is like one of the best support players in
the world right now um he is a whole top but he's the whole

95
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:48,020
top five in the leaderboard one man does not make the whole
team anyway other than that um other than that what else did

96
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:55,900
i want to tell you oh yes by the way um i'm sorry i like how
god of war is always getting cucked by marvel rivals but um

97
00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:07,960
friday god of war is gonna get cooked by Marvel rivals
because um because I got into a rivals tournament super last

98
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:16,240
minute um so if you guys didn't know uh super I have no idea
if it's gonna if it's gonna overlap if it's gonna overlap

99
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:24,300
with the my god of war stream but um super is hosting a
Marvel rivals tournament and I messaged the devs asking like

100
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:29,360
oh are the spots filled like like last night I think it was
it was like last night And then I asked, and they're like,

101
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,080
oh, no, they just started recruiting people.

102
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,440
I was like, oh, yeah, do you think they'd like to have me?

103
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,700
And they're like, yeah, yeah, of course.

104
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:39,040
And so now I'm in the Super's Marvel Rivals tournament that
starts at 12 p.m.

105
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,380
PST on January 16th, which is also God of War.

106
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:51,760
So it might not cuck, it might not cuck the God of War
stream because I don't know, I don't think it'll go for five

107
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,320
hours.

108
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:56,480
So guys, it might not go for five hours, guys.

109
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:12,120
be okay we we might be okay but i will be in the friday
tournament i don't know who my teammates are though um uh i

110
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:17,160
have no idea who my teammates are like i said like i haven't
been sending information yet um i just asked if they're

111
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:23,480
still looking for people and they're like yeah we are so
then like they got the devs uh and the tournament organizer

112
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:29,240
got me in um literally this morning happened so fast.

113
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,340
I didn't think they were still looking.

114
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:37,800
Apparently, they started looking for people yesterday, but
they announced it yesterday.

115
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:45,240
So I was just like, I just, you know, took my shot because I
was like, maybe they still need like one or two players, you

116
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,760
know, because I was thinking like, oh, if they announced it
yesterday.

117
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:57,720
So I don't know, it could be like super finalized already
you know so um so i was just like oh okay maybe maybe

118
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:03,840
they're still looking for one or two more to fill up the
slots so i shot my shot and asked the devs and then they're

119
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:10,560
like and then the organizer and devs were like oh yeah we
just started recruiting people like like today after

135
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:44,740
that was hilarious all right okay non-marvel rivals update
did you guys know not from Boston I felt like my whole world

136
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:55,280
fell apart when I found out that Canadians love naming
random beloved franchises over random places in fucking

137
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:05,680
America because I thought Boston pizza was a American brand
that just happened to be in that just was so popular that

138
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:15,960
they try they franchised out to Canada obviously people
enjoyed Boston pizza so now it's everywhere in Canada but

139
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:27,840
apparently no Boston pizza okay was invented by some fucking
guy in Edmonton because because it's not even it's not okay

140
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:39,480
the story is even crazy the guy called it Boston pizza not
because like he particularly like he was inspired by um um

141
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:47,680
but it was was like he was just like he was from it's not
because he was from Boston but the story of how like Boston

142
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:55,480
pizza was invented was because the founder who was from
Alberta went to Boston and then he tried a pizza there and

143
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:04,320
then it blew his mind so much like it was like he fucking
eat a random pizza in Boston that he was like I gotta start

144
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:12,760
a pizza restaurant and call Boston pizza as like as if like
it's like a fucking tribute to that one place that he ate

145
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:23,660
that fucking blew his mind I was just like no like he just
named it because he was like he had like his first East

146
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:31,400
Coast American pizza and he's like holy shit what the fuck
did I just ate and then you came back to Canada and I was

147
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:38,500
like I gotta start a restaurant and name it after Boston
like because he like hit Nirvana or some shit.

148
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:46,380
And then through that, because like people in America, like
my American fans were like, what the fuck is Boston pizza?

149
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,240
And I was like, what do you mean?

150
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,500
What the fuck is Boston pizza?

151
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:49,660
It's everywhere.

152
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,660
It's from Boston.

153
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:57,740
It's like it's a pizza made from Boston recipes.

154
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,800
Like, what do you mean?

155
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:04,380
And then I found out Boston pizza doesn't even exist in
America.

156
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:20,260
I was like what there's not even a reel in America it's just
it's just in Canada because apparently um

157
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:33,860
apparently um there's a thing that you guys have called
Boston Market and then um I read about Boston Market because

158
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:40,100
I was like what the fuck is Boston Market so that's
something that you guys actually have in America and the

159
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:49,900
thing about it is that Boston market cannot is illegal in
Canada because Boston pizza owns the trademark of Boston so

160
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:58,760
nothing in Canada can be have the name Boston in it because
um Boston pizza owns the trademark for it for the entirety

161
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:10,000
of Canada so they literally kicked up Boston market from
from Canada yeah we own We own the Boston pizza owns the

162
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:23,980
word Boston So American franchises whose name has Boston in
it is legally not allowed to be in Canada Yeah, so yeah,

163
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:31,400
because Boston market got sued by Boston pizza Because
they're like you're not allowed to call yourself Boston

164
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:38,760
Because we own the trademark of Boston here in Canada Which
is also fucking crazy.

165
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:53,820
And then, and then through that, I went, I was in a fucking
rabbit hole of numerous, I couldn't believe New York fries.

166
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:57,300
It is not, it's not New York fries.

167
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,560
I was like, you know what I mean?

168
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,860
The fries are not known in New York.

169
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:06,200
I thought New York was like well known for their fries.

170
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,380
Because we have a franchise called New York fries.

171
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:18,100
So then in my, it's literally a fast food franchise that's
known for just selling French fries.

172
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:19,460
Nothing else.

173
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:23,740
It's all just French fries, but it's different types of
French fries.

174
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:28,960
So I would assume, like I know it's crazy that they meant
when they were able to make a market of that, but it's

175
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,080
actually really fucking good.

176
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:34,020
And so I thought it was pizza and fries.

177
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,200
You know, it could be more than one.

178
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,560
It could be pizza and fries.

179
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:49,040
so in my head I thought New York had really fucking good
fries too because like in Canada we have New York fries and

180
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:59,080
then I found out New York fries was created by a Canadian as
well Canadians invented New York fries best poutine in

181
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:05,180
Canada I should have known when they're like they have
really good poutine as well but it's like um they're not

182
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:16,140
really yeah I I I should should have known when they also
specialize in poutine i was like americans don't know i was

183
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:25,140
like new york does not know anything about poutine um anyway
we also have swiss chalet which is a rotisserie and grill

184
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:31,880
nothing to do with swiss anything um is also owned by
canadians and then we also have i'm like looking through

185
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:38,160
this this tweet about like all this shit we also have
Apparently, I didn't even know about this barbecue place,

186
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:46,620
but apparently the biggest barbecue chain in Canada, because
I'm not really a fan of, um, I don't know, I've never like

187
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:56,080
really got, I don't really go to barbecue bars, but we also
have a barbecue chain called Montana's, uh, uh, I guess they

188
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:05,780
just, and Montana apparently is not known for barbecue, uh,
but it is our most famous, uh, it's our most famous, famous

189
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:17,980
barbecue chain in Canada um and then we also have St Louis
bar and grill which is known for their wings um but um but I

190
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:29,840
guess like it's also owned by Canadians as well St Louis is
owned by Canadians yeah I was just like holy fuck like I

191
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:37,940
don't know what like and then they become really famous too
like all the all these random canadian owned restaurants and

192
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:46,620
they're all like like all of them are just like randomly
named after american places like for no reason i don't

193
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:55,520
fucking know or swiss or swiss chalet um anyway but that's
the that's the life update i wanted to give you guys too oh

194
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:04,360
yeah also deadpool is voiced by saiyu who is our fellow of
vtuber by the way little tell it was really funny because

195
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:12,360
like when we saw the Deadpool preview everyone on Twitter
was like being like yeah that's Sayu like that that's him

196
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:21,680
that's him voicing um that's him voicing Deadpool and then
he was like guys I'm not Deadpool guys oh my god stop like

197
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:31,300
stop spreading this rumor I'm I'm not Deadpool and then he
like and then like you know the you know the official

198
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:41,720
announcement and he was like tiki guys oh my god guys oh who
would have thought i was the voice actor of dead full he's

199
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:53,160
like he's like no one will expect me to be dead full and
everyone was like bro we know we knew gabriel we fucking um

200
00:26:53,160 --> 00:27:03,600
but yeah a fellow a fellow vtuber is technically in uh
marble rivals now i will say you guys might get really

201
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:17,060
annoyed when we try out deadpool because he does not shut up
like when i was pausing and checking my settings out he was

202
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:31,020
still talking so like it's like it's canon he's literally
very lore accurate but he does not stop talking even when

203
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:40,680
you're on the pause menu he will still keep talking because
like you guys were like ha ha that's so funny but if you

204
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:49,320
play this game a lot and if you're a Deadpool player and
you're like play him a lot it might get annoying very

205
00:27:49,320 --> 00:28:04,380
quickly yeah it might because at one point he's just gonna
same lines over and over again so i don't know i don't know

206
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:16,140
how i'm gonna feel about it um so we'll see tomorrow i was
like i was like oh my god he doesn't stop talking like it's

207
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:21,880
just it's just non-stop yapping 24 7.

208
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,480
oh especially especially if you're on the losing side yeah

209
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:37,400
um so it's going to be interesting luckily like I don't
think I'll be able to I'll be playing Deadpool that much

210
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:44,100
overall so like it's not going to affect me but for people
who are like super competitive they might have a little bit

211
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:51,320
of a problem with it because I know like um um I know some
people who don't like that but like for me it doesn't really

212
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:58,300
matter to me because like um I also like I I don't one trick
a character but I feel like people who are like one tricks

213
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:01,580
might Or like, or just play the character a lot.

214
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,480
He is very strong.

215
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:02,700
Yeah.

216
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,140
Uh, he is, he seemed very, very strong.

217
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,300
You can't have three deadpulls on a team, sadly.

218
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:10,760
Um, you can't have three deadpulls on a team.

219
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,860
You can only have one deadpull, but that person can swap
between different deadpulls.

220
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,840
Um, I think you can't have three deadpulls on a team.

221
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:18,580
I don't know.

222
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,220
We, I got, we got to test it.

223
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,640
I don't actually, well, I can't test it out tomorrow anyway.

224
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:27,240
Um, that would be crazy if you can, because he seems really
fucking strong.

225
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,220
Imagine your team having three deadpulls.

226
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,320
That'll be crazy.

227
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,220
Anyway, it is God of War.

228
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,920
Okay, done yapping.

229
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,280

Alright, I guess we go down here.

251
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:23,090
Maybe there's a boat we can use to get to Darlene's.

252
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:28,930
Oh yeah, I saw some people talking about like what the
brainstorm stream ideas are.

253
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:31,690
It's not worth to suggest like games for me to play.

254
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:34,910
It's more like coming up with like creative streams
together.

255
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:38,110
So I was like literally, I was like watching Doug Doug
recently.

256
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:43,190
I mean, I watched him like on and off, but I would like
rewatch some of like I was just like checking his channel

257
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:49,270
out again after having having watched him for like a year
it's like stuff like that like creative streams not like oh

258
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:56,510
can you play x game or can you play this game it's more so
like don't get back to my creative side like I have some

259
00:32:56,510 --> 00:33:03,630
stuff written down um for like some fun things written down
that we could do in the future but it's like those type of

260
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:15,810
creative streams that i'm thinking of yeah all right we go
this way actually i i hit up like a programmer to see if

261
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:23,070
they could create us like a a chat integrate integration
game like dug dug where i do like a battle royale in chat

262
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:32,410
because it's i was inspired by dug doug's um um dug doug's

This might be important.

286
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,260
I should interrupt the dialogue.

That dragon sculpture is not bad.

295
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,360
I don't think it's a dragon.

296
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:59,240
I think it's a actual dead dragon.

297
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,120
Oh, this sculpture.

298
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,320

I literally forgot, but...

324
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:50,120
When I have, like, too many games I'm playing, I forget.

325
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,560
Oh, I remember my train of thought.

326
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,180
I don't know why.

327
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,180
I got, like, super, like...

328
00:37:59,020 --> 00:37:59,800
What's the word?

329
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,720
I got, like, super anal about, like...

330
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,740
Because I was like, oh, shit, am I...

331
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:07,340
Do I look too big on the screen?

332
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,120
So I did make myself a little smaller.

333
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:19,180
I don't know why I got like these random phases this hyper
fixations where I'm like oh do I look too big on the screen

334
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:29,360
oh I just I hope I'm not covering up myself covering up the
game too much so I made myself a little bit smaller I don't

335
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:36,720
know I was like literally for three hours last night last
night and like the last couple of oh wait no um wait why

336
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,020
can't I rob you you're dead I deserve

337
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:49,400
alive I thought the boss music stopped all

338
00:38:53,940 --> 00:39:04,200
right well I guess I can't take this fucking thing but yeah
no I was like right after the right after the Metal Gear

339
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:14,020
stream I had like a weird hype oh my god there you are I
knew it I knew you were hiding somewhere you fucking bitch

340
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:23,220
all right there we go i knew there was one more guy i
couldn't rob this dead lady and then like like he was just

341
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:30,420
sitting there he wasn't even moving that was the worst part
let's just all right don't worry arteus look i can read

342
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:41,120
someone's told me that never mind never mind i still can't
read but like like it was weird i got like in a really weird

343
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:47,580
like hyper fixation about like how big i am on the screen i
might be make myself smaller in the future.

344
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:48,600
Oh my god.

345
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,900
Oh my god.

346
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:50,280
No!

347
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,520
My free money!

348
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,140
Oh wait, wait.

349
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:52,800
I've got it.

350
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:54,420
I got this.

351
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,200
Arteus, this is it's up to you.

352
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,200
Alright.

353
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,000
Wait, does this does he hit him?

354
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,960
No, he doesn't.

355
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:08,600
Wait.

356
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,220
Like every stream I just make myself smaller and smaller.

357
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:25,100
Every stream I just happen to make myself smaller and
smaller and smaller until I'm teeny tiny I know but I can't

358
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:33,520
go there's does he come spawn from behind me no he doesn't
so what the fuck do I do but

359
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:44,290
like I got really like hyper fixated on that because I'm
always worried about like if I'm covering up the screen too

360
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:45,750
much and shit like that.

361
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:52,530
So then I was like literally like looking back and forth the
last three days being like, oh, am I too big on the screen?

362
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:54,370
Do I cover too much stuff?

363
00:40:55,330 --> 00:41:00,110
I think we need some special equipment to use this.

364
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:01,790
Special equipment?

365
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:03,850
You mean not your goddamn arrows?

366
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:05,750
Yeah.

367
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:11,850
Guys, who's that amazing character on the bottom right of
the screen?

368
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:14,110
She looks kind of cool.

369
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:15,450
Thank you for the super chat.

370
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:16,250
Jay, thank you.

371
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:16,990
Thank you.

372
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:19,430
I'm just going to shoot that.

373
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,010
That's it.

374
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:24,090
All right.

375
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:26,230
I don't know.

376
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:27,070
I'm weird like that.

377
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:35,030
I just always want to make sure that you guys are getting
the best experience possible.

378
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:39,250
I mean, we're recovering the third.

379
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:40,150
That's what I'm saying.

380
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:40,630
That's what I'm like.

381
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:41,850
Oh, should I be smaller?

382
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:53,090
or is it or like is it better is it okay because I figure I
was like re-watching the God of Warstream and I was like oh

383
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:54,530
I feel like I'm too big

384
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:10,580
alright let's see there is a blue mark here okay where the
fuck is it

385
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:17,520
I think it's fun wait you do?

386
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:18,280
What do you see?

387
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,340
What do you see with your special eyes?

388
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,320
How do I fucking kill this rodent?

389
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:37,480
Like, it's like behind him, but I can't go behind him.

390
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:42,890
It's... No!

391
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:44,150
No horses!

392
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:47,950
I will kill off all the horses in this land.

393
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:48,850
No!

394
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:52,570
I will prevent the prophecy.

395
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:57,850
It's like that guy who, like, who tried to kill off all the
sons or some shit.

396
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:04,190
Because his, like, um, because, like, in the prophecy, he,
uh, his son was going to kill him.

397
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:09,510
And then in the end, um, one, one of his sons, um, managed
to escape.

398
00:43:09,810 --> 00:43:13,870
And his son fucked his mom because he wasn't, he didn't
know.

399
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:20,210
And then fulfilled the prophecy of killing his dad.

400
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:22,570
Also, yeah, Oedipus.

401
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:28,170
Yeah, and then also banged his mom.

402
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:31,530
It's like, you can't stop fate.

403
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:41,490
Where do I go?

404
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:48,850
Like, there's like three things here, but I don't see any of
the things for me to whack.

405
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,000
Climb up and look down in the hole.

406
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:58,640
Okay.

407
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,920

Well, we got that.

417
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:46,880
I guess we don't get this because I don't know where it is.

418
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:50,980
I don't see any of the blue stuff.

419
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:54,200
Arteus, do you see any of the good shit?

420
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,420

421
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:58,020
Arteus?

422
00:44:58,820 --> 00:44:58,840
Arteus?

424
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:22,720

00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:47,730
But like, that doesn't do anything anyway.

429
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:50,390
Oh!

430
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:53,010

431
00:45:54,430 --> 00:45:56,310
Oh, clever!

432
00:45:57,730 --> 00:45:58,870
Clever, clever.

433
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:00,850
Alright.

434
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,160

436
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:39,440

because it's like they're not like glowing in a way okay

437
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,220
they are they're okay but like They're not, like, super
glowing.

438
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:50,150
They're, like, less obvious than before.

439
00:46:58,330 --> 00:46:59,030
Oh, I had an apple.

440
00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:00,410
An apple.

441
00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:01,390
Oh, I need two.

442
00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:02,990
I guess two apples.

443
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:04,270
Two apples a day.

444
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:07,210
They change from one to two.

445
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:08,450
Oh, that's another boat.

446
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:08,950
Oh, my God.

447
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:10,210
There's boat-free days.

448
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:12,590
Yay.

449
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:14,650
Yeah.

450
00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:22,790
i can see why this game can be really long so not all
dwarves can do that thing brock and cindry do right not all

451
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:32,370
dwarves arteus don't be racist i gather one carefully
cultivated by some secret of dwarven guild or other probably

452
00:47:32,370 --> 00:47:35,530
for the best them alone doing it is disconcerting enough

453
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:48,290
everyone has their own skills arteus not all dwarves are
good at armory we need dwarves who can count money and wars

454
00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:49,470
who can farm.

455
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:51,790
How else would they eat, Arteus?

456
00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:52,310
Think.

457
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:54,710
Think with your brain.

458
00:47:55,410 --> 00:47:56,790
It's a society.

459
00:47:59,830 --> 00:48:00,210
Oh, yeah.

460
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:02,010
Taking a break before visiting Dirlin?

Oh, this is my secret... Oh, never mind.

00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:09,450
I thought it was my secret.

466
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:10,370
It seems useful.

467
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:14,390

Wait I can.

507
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:49,360
Fucking random ass boss fight in the middle of nowhere.

00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:47,540
Oh my god, it's so...

00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:48,600
Oh, it's not fun!

523
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:50,040
It's no longer fun!

524
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:52,400
Oh my god, oh my god.

525
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:52,760
No!

526
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:54,360
No, no, no, no, no!

527
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:56,840
Okay, oh my god.

528
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:59,100
My god, my god, my god, I'm not even close.

529
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,640
Not even close.

530
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:13,820
So easy.

531
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:19,160
All right, didn't even panic at all.

532
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:24,380
Look at that.

533
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:26,100
God.

534
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:32,360
God, gaming is so easy when you're dokeybird.

535
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:36,040
Zero sweat.

536
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:40,820
Oh, shit.

537
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,480
He sent in the prison.

538
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:46,080
Odin's ravens over here.

539
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,760
We're not gonna find all of them.

540
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:48,500
It's fine.

541
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:51,560
Like, it was like 40 plus ravens.

542
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:54,220
And I have fair things to do.

543
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:56,840
I know we won't find them.

544
00:54:56,860 --> 00:55:04,840
all 40 of them see the smoke above us that's where we're
headed let's see if we can't shut it down

545
00:55:09,590 --> 00:55:18,450
all right just let him hate just let the man hate let him
watch if he wants to

546
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:32,220
oh all right it's fine It's poison from above.

547
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:34,260
It's fine.

548
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:35,180
Boom!

549
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:38,780
Why are you hitting yourself, huh?

550
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:40,100
That's fucking right.

551
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:43,220
Alright, there's this guy over here.

552
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:45,460
Get over here.

553
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:46,160
That's right.

554
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:47,100
Oh, shit.

555
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:48,040
That's where's my axe.

556
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:49,880
I hate it.

557
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:50,640
Whoops.

558
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:53,800
Easy.

559
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:55,440
Alright, who did that?

560
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,400
Oh, it's over here.

561
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:00,520
Oh, my.

562
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:03,580
God, guys, please, one at a time.

563
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:07,300
There's plenty of dad going everywhere.

564
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:10,200
Jesus Christ, that's a lot.

565
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:13,220
There's enough dad to go around.

566
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:19,440
Oh, shit.

567
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:20,700
Oh, that's what he meant.

568
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:22,280
Because I was like, what do you mean?

569
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:23,040
I dodged.

570
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:23,900
Did I not?

571
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:29,940
Oh, my God.

572
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:31,700
Get this flying creature out of here.

573
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:54,960
for you fucking cheater just cuz you can fly so many enemies
holy shit that's fucking right there's so many there's more

574
00:56:54,960 --> 00:57:04,860
enemies in the last game for sure I think is that all
there's more Jesus.

575
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:07,000
Incoming!

576
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:08,640
Incoming!

577
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:10,860
Alright, oh there you go.

578
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:17,680
The rings likely chock a block with materials that could
help us.

579
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:20,160
I'd grab whatever it spits up in the process.

580
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:21,860
Alright, let's grab some HP.

581
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:24,920
Oh, wait, that's not where I want to go.

582
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:26,540
Bring me down.

583
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:29,460
Alright, nice.

584
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:30,160
Reload.

585
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:35,520
What do I do here?

586
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:41,800
Okay.

587
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:49,220
Oh, shit.

588
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:52,820
No more smoke.

589
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:56,740
Oh, it's the mining rigs I shut down.

590
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:57,920
Oh, that's why.

591
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,200
I talk to them to their own exploitation.

592
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:00,900
They need their choice.

593
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:03,300
Work or die is not a choice.

594
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:05,200
I only made it seem so.

595
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:09,600
What you just picked up there is pure, Spartal fight war.

596
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:15,840
It won't be of use in the rig anymore, but perhaps our
Holder brothers could craft something from it.

597
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:17,440
Okay.

598
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:19,800
We need, like, two more of that.

599
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:22,080
Okay, so we do more of the mining stuff.

600
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:25,820
Then we'll be able to craft the other armor that we saw.

601
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:27,780
That was the armor, right?

602
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:32,200
Bro, the George and Rala above capitalism.

603
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:32,760
What do you mean?

604
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,280
That's literally their whole shick.

605
00:58:36,280 --> 00:59:04,500
all right i don't remember how united oh wait is that united
okay um l2r2 l2r2 there we go i did it so hard oh my god i

606
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:05,260
could use that

607
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:12,360
And a two are two!

608
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:14,920
What the fuck?

609
00:59:22,270 --> 00:59:24,150
Oh my god.

610
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:26,790
Oh my god.

611
00:59:27,690 --> 00:59:28,910
The bomb.

612
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:33,370
Okay, how?

613
00:59:34,390 --> 00:59:35,010
How?

614
00:59:35,350 --> 00:59:37,430
Oh my god, I swear to you guys, I go up here.

615
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:42,070
And then...

616
00:59:42,070 --> 00:59:44,050
How the fuck do I...

617
00:59:44,050 --> 00:59:46,350
Okay, wait, wait, I figured it out.

618
00:59:47,930 --> 00:59:48,890
There you go.

619
00:59:50,010 --> 00:59:51,070
Are you fucking... Okay.

620
00:59:52,670 --> 00:59:53,410
There we go.

621
00:59:54,130 --> 00:59:54,810
L2R2.

622
00:59:57,630 --> 00:59:59,470
Okay, we're missing one more.

623
01:00:02,650 --> 01:00:05,130
Where is the last L2R2?

624
01:00:08,450 --> 01:00:09,690
Where is it?

625
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:15,550
Where is it hiding?

626
01:00:16,770 --> 01:00:17,790
Those two are two?

627
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:20,930
Where are you hiding?

628
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:27,220
What the fuck?

629
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:30,380
I don't see anymore.

630
01:00:30,540 --> 01:00:31,400
It's over there.

631
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:33,600
Did you see it?

632
01:00:36,020 --> 01:00:38,760
And I'll come out wherever you are.

633
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:43,360
There's breaking random jars.

634
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:47,360
I literally don't see any more pots.

635
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:51,440
Hello?

636
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:52,780

638
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:57,180
Fuck that jar.

639
01:00:59,340 --> 01:00:59,600
Oh.

01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:01,640
Wait, what's that?

641
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:04,320
Oh, it's nothing.

01:01:06,340 --> 01:01:07,440
Over there.

643
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:08,460
Over where?

644
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:11,060
Where the fuck is this jar?

645
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:15,330
It's a jar.

01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:55,780
Okay, I need one or two.

651
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:59,460
God, these guys are so stingy.

652
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:02,960
You would think like apples are so easy to get here.

653
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:06,120
They're all about them apples.

654
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,580
Is that pure Spartle-fine slag?

655
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:16,460
Give it here.

656
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:21,240
What does he make for us if I give it to him?

657
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,200

Take care of your armor and it'll take care of you I'm
already lost.

662
01:03:00,290 --> 01:03:04,450
I don't know where I've been and where I haven't been We
visited two places.

663
01:03:04,690 --> 01:03:06,770
I'm like where do I go now?

664
01:03:07,710 --> 01:03:09,350
I'll go to the other rig right here.

665
01:03:09,470 --> 01:03:11,350
Oh wait, there's a key right here.

666
01:03:11,410 --> 01:03:14,050
You think shutting these things down will help the dwarfs
become independent?

667
01:03:14,610 --> 01:03:22,410
I don't know but I have to try something He did say there is
an island near the geyser that has a key

668
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:30,400
Should be like this island, right?

669
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:33,440
That's the key island.

670
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:38,260
Yeah, I'm still sick.

671
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:44,440
I'm unfortunately still sick, but I'm taking it.

672
01:03:47,980 --> 01:03:50,820
Oh my god, not the stupid fucking lizards.

673
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:53,980
Get out of here.

674
01:03:55,580 --> 01:03:56,420
Get out of here.

675
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:56,680
here.

676
01:03:57,860 --> 01:03:59,640
Oh my god, we gotta destroy the nest.

677
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:01,560
We gotta destroy his home.

678
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:05,000
We gotta get his home.

679
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:08,360
We will make you an extinct species.

680
01:04:09,340 --> 01:04:10,580
They're an invasive species.

681
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:12,060
We gotta let him go.

682
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,960
Alright, where do I go now?

683
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:19,680
Shoot the pot.

684
01:04:21,260 --> 01:04:21,700
Never mind.

685
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:22,940
I got a giant axe.

686
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:42,380
Okay, for this way down I didn't orphan those lizards I
killed the orphans so that makes it better they're not

687
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:55,320

where's the other nest the ground looks weak down here

688
01:04:55,320 --> 01:05:14,300

we push this up oh guess not oh there we go that gear let's

689
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:20,980
take it with freeze then we do this maybe that lift can help
us get high might be easier to break that ground from up

690
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:23,360
What?

691
01:05:23,780 --> 01:05:24,680
Oh, from here.

692
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:30,760
Alright, up I go.

693
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:33,800
Yeah!

694
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:42,700
Okay, and then...

695
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:44,620
Get my axe back.

696
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:48,020
And then...

697
01:05:48,020 --> 01:05:48,980
Watch this.

698
01:05:50,180 --> 01:05:50,740
Oh!

699
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:51,620
Okay, sorry.

700
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:52,680
Just testing it out.

701
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:54,440
I had to see how fire...

702
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:57,020
Yeah, I can.

703
01:05:57,420 --> 01:05:58,100
That's right.

704
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:00,140
Oh, my Okay.

705
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:01,600
Oh my god.

706
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:03,280
Any fucking spits losers out.

707
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:04,580
I'm fucking course.

708
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:06,940
I'm just gonna beat him up.

709
01:06:09,380 --> 01:06:10,160
That's fucking right.

710
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:11,460
Oh my god.

711
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:12,180
No, not the child.

712
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:13,960
We're here to beat up mama.

713
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:16,440
Mama time.

714
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:18,100
We gotta beat up the mom.

715
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:19,540
Okay.

716
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:20,980
That's okay.

717
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:22,300
He's just sending out more kids.

718
01:06:23,260 --> 01:06:24,660
But they do not matter to me.

719
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:26,280
That's fucking right.

720
01:06:29,060 --> 01:06:30,140
Jesus Christ.

721
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:34,060
Oh my god, that's stupid, goddamn...

722
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:35,860
Alright, that's it!

723
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:36,980
Fist to fist!

724
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:39,140
Get out of here!

725
01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:43,360
Okay, now that they're orphans, we'll make sure there's no
witnesses.

726
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:46,960
Alright, now there's no orphans.

727
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:47,600
Look at that.

728
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:48,600
Isn't that beautiful?

729
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:51,680
Life is beautiful, the circle of life.

730
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:55,100
Alright, let's see.

731
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:57,160
The key should be here.

732
01:07:00,140 --> 01:07:01,180
Is that the key?

733
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:01,840
That's the key.

734
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:02,620
Oh, there you go.

735
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:05,280
Now we must head to that watchtower on the shore.

736
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:12,700
Nature is beautiful, guys.

737
01:07:13,740 --> 01:07:16,260
I just need you to trust me.

738
01:07:16,420 --> 01:07:20,300
All right, so where is the watchtower?

739
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:21,880
Is it there?

740
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:24,140
I think it was there.

741
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:26,080
It was like here, right?

742
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:28,200
I'm already lost.

743
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:30,600
Do I have a map?

744
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:31,260
Oh, I do.

745
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:31,780
Okay.

746
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:38,260
I was gonna say, oh, that's not helpful because I don't
remember how I got there.

747
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:44,500
I, I, oh, I should have, oh, I should have looked this up.

748
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:49,360
Okay, I'll just go this way first.

749
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:54,820
Amir, how many stories have you told about Odin and Thor and
all the bad things they've done?

750
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:56,720
Let's see how many we can remember.

751
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:59,160
Seems like Father could use his memory refreshed.

752
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:09,220
is no refreshment okay and then from here i'm talking about
history all the other people they've heard let's see where

01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:32,200

755
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:33,880
Here.

756
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:35,480
And then...

757
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:36,660
Oh, oh, I remember now.

758
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:37,360
I remember.

759
01:08:38,020 --> 01:08:38,860
It's up here.

760
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:41,480
Yeah, see, guys?

761
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:42,200
I remember.

762
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:44,620
And then here.

763
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:46,400
And then it's not here.

764
01:08:49,980 --> 01:08:50,860
It's here.

765
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:51,760
It's here.

766
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:53,840
I lost the 50-50.

767
01:08:53,980 --> 01:08:55,220
But I remember now.

768
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:56,540
I remember, guys.

769
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:57,320
It's here.

770
01:08:57,880 --> 01:08:58,700
It's here.

771
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:00,480
And then we go...

772
01:09:01,060 --> 01:09:02,480
Oh, I can't go up from here.

773
01:09:02,660 --> 01:09:03,540
We go up here.

774
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:07,320
See, I told you guys I remember.

775
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:12,660
It was just the opposite of what I remember.

776
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:14,200
No.

777
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:15,640
Thought I heard a voice.

778
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:17,340
Let's keep going live.

779
01:09:17,780 --> 01:09:18,960
I opened the jail.

780
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:22,260
Yeah, my memory's just mirrored right now.

781
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:30,920
Knock, knock.

782
01:09:31,780 --> 01:09:32,080
Yeah.

783
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:35,300
You could give that drum a good loud strike.

784
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:37,200
Oh, okay.

785
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:40,280
I guess it's a cutscene strike.

786
01:09:47,870 --> 01:09:48,210
Oh.

787
01:09:49,890 --> 01:09:50,890
Where is he?

788
01:09:53,170 --> 01:09:55,130
Yeah, my controller was inverted, guys.

789
01:09:55,190 --> 01:09:55,770
That's why I got...

790
01:09:55,770 --> 01:09:56,610
I hit the wrong thing.

791
01:09:56,650 --> 01:09:56,850
What?

792
01:09:57,270 --> 01:09:59,010
So that's the voice I heard.

793
01:09:59,590 --> 01:10:01,190
I'd hoped it would have escaped my narrative.

794
01:10:02,390 --> 01:10:04,190
We'll need to free it from its restraints.

795
01:10:04,890 --> 01:10:06,670
Oh, that's a big-ass turtle!

796
01:10:10,890 --> 01:10:11,990
Oh, shit.

797
01:10:15,070 --> 01:10:15,990
That's a turtle.

798
01:10:17,370 --> 01:10:18,590
Oh, that's a whale.

799
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:19,610
That's not a turtle.

800
01:10:20,170 --> 01:10:20,550
That's a...

801
01:10:22,790 --> 01:10:23,390
That's...

802
01:10:23,390 --> 01:10:24,550
Because that's a whale.

803
01:10:25,190 --> 01:10:25,410
Wait.

804
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:28,150
Oh, I can't use my weapon when I'm on the boat.

805
01:10:28,650 --> 01:10:29,070
Hello.

806
01:10:29,310 --> 01:10:30,450
Where are your restraints?

807
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:31,130
Sir?

808
01:10:31,350 --> 01:10:32,710
What is this?

809
01:10:33,090 --> 01:10:33,810
A loon boker.

810
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:35,250
I captured it.

811
01:10:35,870 --> 01:10:36,490

Yeah, they won't need it.

869
01:15:23,860 --> 01:15:24,180
They're dead.

870
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:34,040
I wish there was, like, fast travel, like, fast lie.

871
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:42,420
Where the fuck is the last restraint?

872

Oh my god, this house.

884
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:33,740
I did not notice that.

885
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:34,540
Don't worry.

886
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:37,520
We're going to get rid of your house now.

887
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:38,960
Oh.

888
01:17:40,580 --> 01:17:42,120

Oh, okay.

891
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:48,580
Alright, now I know how to get it, though.

892
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:53,880
Alright, there we go.

893
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:58,840
And then...

894
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:00,940
I open the shortcut.

895
01:18:02,740 --> 01:18:03,180
Yay!

896
01:18:05,100 --> 01:18:05,780
Wee!

897
01:18:06,780 --> 01:18:08,920
Okay, there is one more over there.

898
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:13,400
I'll hide.

899
01:18:17,370 --> 01:18:18,810
I guess I carry this.

900
01:18:26,890 --> 01:18:27,330
And...

901
01:18:28,350 --> 01:18:30,510
I mean, how long can I hold it for?

902
01:18:34,830 --> 01:18:35,830
Okay, okay.

903
01:18:36,210 --> 01:18:38,430
I don't know if, like, I need to...

904
01:18:38,430 --> 01:18:39,250
I can use that.

905
01:18:39,310 --> 01:18:40,250
But we'll try again.

906
01:18:40,910 --> 01:18:43,030
I didn't know there was fall off, guys.

907
01:18:44,090 --> 01:18:44,590
I don't know.

908
01:18:44,730 --> 01:18:50,590
I big, strong arms did not realize I would not fucking chuck
it like a baseball.

909
01:18:51,230 --> 01:18:53,050
Maybe that dock can lead us to the tail.

910
01:18:54,010 --> 01:18:54,070
Okay.

911
01:18:54,070 --> 01:18:54,710
Let's get back to the boat.

912
01:18:56,670 --> 01:19:00,450
Yeah, I don't think Kratos is going to do anything with
baseball anytime soon.

913
01:19:01,450 --> 01:19:02,450
Does that surprise you?

914
01:19:03,290 --> 01:19:06,530
That an old man would be ashamed of the mistakes he's made.

915
01:19:07,550 --> 01:19:07,730
No.

916
01:19:14,150 --> 01:19:15,110
I thought...

917
01:19:15,110 --> 01:19:18,510
I'd hoped the creature would be long expired by now.

918
01:19:19,590 --> 01:19:21,210
But apparently the ACR couldn't use it.

919
01:19:21,230 --> 01:19:31,270
be bothered to mercy kill it once it was no longer useful uh
we could kill it what no not when we can save it bro he's

920
01:19:31,270 --> 01:19:37,550
like so healthy i was like he's like don't hey guys i'm fine
no don't we just need to kill him it's like guys look i'm

921
01:19:37,550 --> 01:19:47,810
i'm all better now everything is okay he's like no he's
suffering look at him you would still save this broken

922
01:19:47,810 --> 01:19:56,270
creature i know what it is to be imprisoned like this i
can't just leave it and if it is beyond saving i don't

923
01:19:56,270 --> 01:20:01,790
understand let us continue all right hell yeah

924
01:20:06,090 --> 01:20:21,390

925
01:20:21,390 --> 01:20:22,290

926
01:20:22,990 --> 01:20:24,870
Oh, shit, I could chop them so early.

927
01:20:25,670 --> 01:20:27,590
It was, like, not even...

928
01:20:28,250 --> 01:20:29,950
Well, okay, grab, grab how.

929
01:20:31,230 --> 01:20:35,030
Oh, shit, I did not mean to do that, but that's fine.

930
01:20:37,170 --> 01:20:38,050
Overkill time.

931
01:20:38,610 --> 01:20:40,290
Fuck that one guy in particular.

932
01:20:43,570 --> 01:20:43,830
Alright.

933
01:20:45,170 --> 01:20:46,050
We'll just...

934
01:20:46,630 --> 01:20:47,390
That's fine.

935
01:20:48,870 --> 01:20:50,410
I'll just use my fist.

936
01:20:50,590 --> 01:20:52,130
Okay, he's definitely dead.

937
01:20:54,110 --> 01:20:56,310
Yeah, I was like, oh yeah, no, he's off the cliff.

938
01:20:56,470 --> 01:20:58,190
I don't need to do anything else after that.

939
01:20:59,750 --> 01:21:00,110
Again?

940
01:21:01,410 --> 01:21:02,830
How you still am not?

941
01:21:02,850 --> 01:21:03,750
Oh my god, there's a lot.

942
01:21:03,850 --> 01:21:04,170
Never mind.

943
01:21:04,290 --> 01:21:04,830
There is a lot.

944
01:21:05,130 --> 01:21:06,310
There is a lot of them.

945
01:21:07,230 --> 01:21:09,330
Okay, I was not expecting all of these guys.

946
01:21:10,770 --> 01:21:11,970
I fucking know.

947
01:21:14,830 --> 01:21:15,910
Oh my god, my axe.

948
01:21:17,630 --> 01:21:19,650
I just fucking chucked that out.

949
01:21:20,590 --> 01:21:22,950
Oh my god, they're always behind me!

950
01:21:27,990 --> 01:21:29,290
Where's the last guy?

951
01:21:31,290 --> 01:21:32,170
Get out of here.

952
01:21:35,190 --> 01:21:36,200
Alright, they're all dead.

953
01:21:38,330 --> 01:21:39,310
We're fine.

954
01:21:42,630 --> 01:21:42,930
See?

955
01:21:43,270 --> 01:21:44,670
I got my HP again.

956
01:21:45,710 --> 01:21:47,710
It's like nothing bad ever happened.

957
01:21:49,910 --> 01:21:50,570
Okay.

958
01:21:50,590 --> 01:21:51,130
this guy.

959
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:00,620
Did you check behind you?

960
01:22:04,130 --> 01:22:05,790
How about I cut it?

961
01:22:06,990 --> 01:22:08,990
Oh, I was all the way down there.

962
01:22:10,850 --> 01:22:13,030
Alright, but first, let me explore.

963
01:22:18,210 --> 01:22:19,470
Don't worry, I'll be back.

964
01:22:20,350 --> 01:22:21,810
Don't worry, you'll be free soon.

965
01:22:23,050 --> 01:22:24,510
Just want a little bit of loot.

966
01:22:26,070 --> 01:22:27,310
A little bit of loot.

967
01:22:28,030 --> 01:22:29,370
and hurt nobody.

968
01:22:31,930 --> 01:22:32,950
Howard, thank you for the super chat.

969
01:22:33,150 --> 01:22:33,990
Thank you, thank you.

970
01:22:34,470 --> 01:22:39,730
Saw you were on the big screen before I was trying to go and
any plans on visiting SCA, AnnieCon again.

971
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:40,750
Thank you for the super chat.

972
01:22:40,910 --> 01:22:41,670
Thank you, thank you.

973
01:22:42,650 --> 01:22:43,770
Uh, I don't know.

974
01:22:44,030 --> 01:22:49,210
It's, uh, I don't, for events and stuff, my event staff
handles most of it.

975
01:22:49,290 --> 01:22:51,190
And I just say yes or no.

976
01:22:51,870 --> 01:22:52,690
But I would love to.

977
01:22:52,990 --> 01:22:56,970
I'd love to come back to more Southeast Asia cons.

978
01:22:58,030 --> 01:23:01,830
I always love visiting dragons from around the world.

979
01:23:02,990 --> 01:23:06,550
I'm going to be as many dragons as possible from around the
world.

980
01:23:08,730 --> 01:23:09,910
Happy birthday!

981
01:23:15,130 --> 01:23:15,250

01:23:19,430 --> 01:23:21,450
Happy birthday to you.

01:23:21,890 --> 01:23:24,130
Happy birthday, dear Howard.

985
01:23:24,670 --> 01:23:26,830
Happy birthday to you.

986
01:23:29,750 --> 01:23:44,010

987
01:23:48,990 --> 01:24:01,510
there you're free free with him okay but what about this
rope thing what's going on yeah what He's not, he's like,

988
01:24:01,930 --> 01:24:01,930
nope.

989
01:24:04,490 --> 01:24:07,830
That was gonna say, I don't think he doesn't want to go.

990
01:24:14,410 --> 01:24:15,290
What's this?

991
01:24:17,990 --> 01:24:20,350
Yeah, I don't think we can do anything with that yet.

992
01:24:21,570 --> 01:24:26,350
Boy, I paid for your education and you can't do anything
about it.

993
01:24:27,070 --> 01:24:27,890
What's the point?

994
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:35,240
I sent you to Magic College and you didn't learn anything.

995
01:24:36,740 --> 01:24:40,740
This creature, the mining rigs, their mistakes, Amir.

996
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:42,560
But it's Odin's fault.

997
01:24:43,140 --> 01:24:44,700
That's not an excuse, little one.

998
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:46,720
But thank you for seeing it.

999
01:24:50,730 --> 01:24:51,630
Wait, was there...

1000
01:24:52,450 --> 01:24:52,870
Treasure?

1001
01:24:55,630 --> 01:24:57,330
Oh yeah, he was homeschooled.

1002
01:24:57,570 --> 01:24:59,910
Boy, I homeschooled you when you're there, nothing?

1003
01:25:12,750 --> 01:25:13,850
Oh, yeah, apparently, like...

1004
01:25:16,390 --> 01:25:16,830
Um...

1005
01:25:17,830 --> 01:25:19,370
asked me if I was in Sapporo.

1006
01:25:20,470 --> 01:25:21,370
And I was like, no.

1007
01:25:21,670 --> 01:25:24,390
Because I was going to be in Japan anyway for...

1008
01:25:24,390 --> 01:25:26,950
What treasure?

1009
01:25:27,570 --> 01:25:28,490
You guys lied to me.

1010
01:25:28,570 --> 01:25:29,910
I got all the treasure.

1011
01:25:30,530 --> 01:25:32,210
Anyway, for the Street Fighter thing.

1012
01:25:33,430 --> 01:25:34,750
So I was just like...

1013
01:25:34,750 --> 01:25:36,010
The other way?

1014
01:25:36,190 --> 01:25:37,090
What do you mean the other way?

1015
01:25:37,110 --> 01:25:38,130
I got all the treasure.

1016
01:25:39,470 --> 01:25:39,870
See?

1017
01:25:44,300 --> 01:25:46,120
I'm going to go back to the whale now.

1018
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:50,840
Oh, you mean the treasure?

1019
01:25:50,860 --> 01:25:53,740
I left from when I actually went down.

1020
01:25:55,940 --> 01:26:00,140
Apparently, though, they had a snowstorm in Sapporo.

1021
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:03,160
So a lot of flights got canceled and stuff.

1022
01:26:03,180 --> 01:26:04,700
Well, there you have it, lad.

1023
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:07,760
That's scary.

1024
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:09,220
That's always scary.

1025
01:26:09,420 --> 01:26:10,620
A snowstorm, too.

1026
01:26:10,820 --> 01:26:16,620
Like, flying into, like, doing a long flight in the middle
of a snowstorm.

1027
01:26:17,020 --> 01:26:20,840
But, yeah, apparently, like, a lot of flights got canceled
to Sapporo.

1028
01:26:20,860 --> 01:26:25,680
So some people might not make it on day one of land.

1029
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:31,920
Like those who are like bootcamping, bootcamping on like out
of like different countries.

1030
01:26:34,380 --> 01:26:40,840
Apparently some players might not even like make it to like
the first day, which is crazy.

1031
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:47,240
Oh, it's explosive here.

1032
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:55,560
What is the shortcut for?

1033
01:26:59,580 --> 01:27:01,720
I don't remember where this is.

1034
01:27:03,380 --> 01:27:04,700
Where is the circuit?

1035
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:05,320
Oh, wait.

1036
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:14,540
I'm lost.

1037
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:16,800
I'm always lost.

1038
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:20,640
Oh, to my right?

1039
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:21,740
This is my right.

1040
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:26,620
Yeah, but I can't explode that.

1041
01:27:26,740 --> 01:27:28,820
I need to find the explosive.

1042
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:34,360
I hear it.

1043
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:40,680
I hear it.

1044
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:47,580
Oh my god, I hear the...

1045
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:53,060
Where is it?

1046
01:27:55,380 --> 01:27:56,580
Through this door?

1047
01:27:58,060 --> 01:27:58,820
Oh, there it is.

1048
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:00,320
I fucking knew I heard it.

1049
01:28:02,940 --> 01:28:05,700
Alright, let's get rid of this one first.

1050
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:07,080
Because I realized there is more loot.

1051
01:28:07,100 --> 01:28:30,680
here yeah I remember this area there you go yeah yeah and
the way it's like free me you know that yeah don't worry

1052
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:36,880
well we'll free you soon we just gotta take all your money
first.

1053
01:28:41,860 --> 01:28:43,120
Okay, this one.

1054
01:28:49,660 --> 01:28:50,780
And then...

1055
01:28:50,780 --> 01:28:54,760
I mean, he's been in prison for hundreds of years.

1056
01:28:54,900 --> 01:28:57,240
He can be in prison for, like, five more minutes.

1057
01:29:01,620 --> 01:29:02,180
Alright.

1058
01:29:04,140 --> 01:29:05,400
I missed a hole?

1059
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:08,760
Well, we all know if there's a hole.

1060
01:29:12,410 --> 01:29:13,350
Where's the hole?

1061
01:29:13,630 --> 01:29:14,710
Yeah?

1062
01:29:20,860 --> 01:29:22,820
Is there a hole here that I missed?

1063
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:27,300
Oh, there was!

1064
01:29:28,240 --> 01:29:29,260
There is a goal!

1065
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:36,020
Oh, that is secret.

1066
01:29:36,180 --> 01:29:37,000
Secret, don't know.

1067
01:29:38,420 --> 01:29:39,540
So much loot.

1068
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:43,100
Oh, hey.

1069
01:29:43,700 --> 01:29:44,600
Stupid crow.

1070
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:49,840
Yeah, we're not getting a 48 of these guys.

1071
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:51,460
There's no point.

1072
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:54,460
No, that's all right.

1073
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:56,820
If Oden wants to watch, he can watch.

1074
01:29:56,920 --> 01:29:57,780
I'm fine with that.

1075
01:30:03,220 --> 01:30:03,600
Yeah.

1076
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:06,440
Goodbye.

1077
01:30:08,260 --> 01:30:10,140
I knew Kroki was a double agent.

1078
01:30:11,480 --> 01:30:11,820
Wait.

1079
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:13,520
Yeah, it's here.

1080
01:30:15,100 --> 01:30:16,080
Wait, where am I?

1081
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:19,520
Wait, wait, it was not out yet.

1082
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:20,060
Wait a minute.

1083
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:20,840
Give me a sec.

1084
01:30:21,620 --> 01:30:22,520
Okay, it's down here.

1085
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:24,540
Okay, I got lost in the sauce.

1086
01:30:29,060 --> 01:30:29,760
This way.

1087
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:34,640
And then...

1088
01:30:36,020 --> 01:30:36,460
Uh...

1089
01:30:36,460 --> 01:30:37,200
This way.

1090
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:40,760
Knew it.

1091
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:42,100
And then where's my boat?

1092
01:30:45,740 --> 01:30:46,620
And then...

1093
01:30:46,620 --> 01:30:47,660
Wait, where the fuck?

1094
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:56,080

1096
01:31:14,750 --> 01:31:24,250
yeah i'm i'm odin's twitch stream right now i'm his favorite
twitch streamer Our crow streamer on crow.tv.

1097
01:31:25,630 --> 01:31:27,670
All right, now we can talk to the eye.

1098
01:31:30,430 --> 01:31:31,490
All right, that's his tail.

1099
01:31:31,690 --> 01:31:33,250
So his eye should be up here.

1100
01:31:35,770 --> 01:31:37,710
What other terrible things have Odin and Thor done?

1101
01:31:38,550 --> 01:31:38,790
Okay.

1102
01:31:39,430 --> 01:31:41,330
There was Thaumor, the stone mason.

1103
01:31:41,770 --> 01:31:42,070
Hi.

1104
01:31:42,370 --> 01:31:43,670
He quarreled with his son.

1105
01:31:44,090 --> 01:31:45,330
Went into the night to find him.

1106
01:31:45,770 --> 01:31:46,970
Found Thor instead.

1107
01:31:47,630 --> 01:31:49,090
And there was Thaumor's son.

1108
01:31:49,710 --> 01:31:50,990
Oh, he only has one.

1109
01:31:51,070 --> 01:31:51,430
God.

1110
01:31:52,690 --> 01:31:57,110
And whispered something of importance to Freya before his
betrayal and assassination.

1111
01:31:57,650 --> 01:31:59,550
How's the audio so far?

1112
01:32:00,710 --> 01:32:01,690
You guys hear them?

1113
01:32:02,390 --> 01:32:07,010
Thor murdered her husband and Odin covered it up before
doing her in himself.

1114
01:32:07,790 --> 01:32:08,610
You can't forget Amir.

1115
01:32:09,250 --> 01:32:09,990
The first giant.

1116
01:32:10,330 --> 01:32:16,550
Odin carved him up to form the realms from his body and let
the torrent of his blood nearly drown every giant alive.

1117
01:32:17,470 --> 01:32:18,610
What about the giants of Yodenhunt?

1118
01:32:19,410 --> 01:32:21,050
They all seem dead when we finally made it there.

1119
01:32:21,070 --> 01:32:22,590
That remains a mystery.

1120
01:32:23,290 --> 01:32:26,050
Though admittedly, it sounds like the Asiore god's dream.

1121
01:32:26,850 --> 01:32:27,670
What about Fjordian?

1122
01:32:28,170 --> 01:32:29,270
Thor's mother was a giant.

1123
01:32:30,010 --> 01:32:30,450
Wasn't she?

1124
01:32:30,830 --> 01:32:31,830
Indeed she was.

1125
01:32:32,450 --> 01:32:35,250
The circumstances of her demise were murky at best.

1126
01:32:35,910 --> 01:32:38,010
But not sure I can blame Odin for that one.

1127
01:32:38,570 --> 01:32:39,830
He wasn't the same after.

1128
01:32:40,610 --> 01:32:41,350
Oh, I know.

1129
01:32:42,270 --> 01:32:44,570
There was Skavi, the queen of the hunt.

1130
01:32:44,930 --> 01:32:46,990
I, she spurned Odin's affections.

1131
01:32:47,490 --> 01:32:49,330
So we tricked her into killing her father.

1132
01:32:51,070 --> 01:32:51,730
Gather the mighty.

1133
01:32:52,490 --> 01:32:53,810
The Yotenar military leader.

1134
01:32:54,370 --> 01:32:55,210
Slandered by Odin.

1135
01:32:55,790 --> 01:32:56,990
Tricked and murdered by Thor.

1136
01:32:57,270 --> 01:32:58,110
Are these all the ladies?

1137
01:32:58,390 --> 01:32:58,930
He banged?

1138
01:32:59,830 --> 01:33:01,470
The giant king who stole Thor's hand.

1139
01:33:01,490 --> 01:33:02,330
Oh no, all the people he was killed.

1140
01:33:02,690 --> 01:33:04,130
Odin traded him free to get it back.

1141
01:33:04,690 --> 01:33:08,170
And sent Thor in disguise to murder his entire corpse.

1142
01:33:08,710 --> 01:33:10,210
Oh, fuck, bro.

1143
01:33:10,870 --> 01:33:12,130
Groom near the brawler.

1144
01:33:12,750 --> 01:33:13,410
The stone giant.

1145
01:33:13,750 --> 01:33:14,050
I.

1146
01:33:14,610 --> 01:33:15,590
Mocked by Odin.

1147
01:33:16,030 --> 01:33:16,910
Murdered by Thor.

1148
01:33:17,170 --> 01:33:17,910
Enough of this.

1149
01:33:18,210 --> 01:33:18,910
But there's more.

1150
01:33:19,030 --> 01:33:19,610
I do not care.

1151
01:33:19,790 --> 01:33:20,770
There's fucking hitless.

1152
01:33:21,070 --> 01:33:21,290
Crazy.

1153
01:33:21,770 --> 01:33:22,770
Is not the answer.

1154
01:33:23,390 --> 01:33:24,490
Warren, thank you for the super chat.

1155
01:33:24,730 --> 01:33:24,930
Thank you.

1156
01:33:25,170 --> 01:33:25,590
Thank you.

1157
01:33:26,310 --> 01:33:27,690
One fact about Odin's ravening.

1158
01:33:27,870 --> 01:33:29,310
There are sacrifice children.

1159
01:33:29,470 --> 01:33:30,070
So you're committing...

1160
01:33:30,590 --> 01:33:30,870
Oh!

1161
01:33:31,510 --> 01:33:33,030
No, I'm committing murder.

1162
01:33:35,590 --> 01:33:36,950
Warren, thank you for the super chat.

1163
01:33:37,110 --> 01:33:38,650
Get it, right Warren?

1164
01:33:39,150 --> 01:33:41,590
It's not abuse, it's murder.

1165
01:33:43,670 --> 01:33:44,630
Come here.

1166
01:33:45,170 --> 01:33:46,270
What do you think it means?

1167
01:33:46,850 --> 01:33:49,070
Seeing more raiders come back as Hellwalkers lately.

1168
01:33:49,070 --> 01:33:55,650
I thought freeing the Valkyrie Queen was supposed to restore
balance to the realms and keep that from happening That's a

1169
01:33:55,650 --> 01:34:02,810
good question lad and a troubling one If hell's filled up
again, it suggests that something's been hindering Siegren's

1170
01:34:02,810 --> 01:34:10,110
efforts Or perhaps something even more urgent is keeping her
distracted Unable to visit even occasionally.

1171
01:34:11,050 --> 01:34:11,050
Yeah.

1172
01:34:11,650 --> 01:34:12,610
Sorry, Namir.

1173
01:34:13,350 --> 01:34:21,370
All right It's time to talk to him Okay Go talk to your
whale girlfriend

1174
01:34:33,490 --> 01:34:41,510
Go on you great blubbering beast This is free willy go on
Why is it not moving?

1175
01:34:42,150 --> 01:34:44,350
Custom do its change.

1176
01:34:44,370 --> 01:34:48,590
Oh No, no, we can fix this.

1177
01:34:48,830 --> 01:34:58,650
We just need to chase it off and scare it Go we didn't love
you anyways like the ash catch on with butterfree go We hate

1178
01:34:58,650 --> 01:35:00,670
you Oh, he better than they were.

1179
01:35:09,010 --> 01:35:11,010
He likes the wind blowing on its face.

1180
01:35:12,610 --> 01:35:13,610
I can feel it.

1181
01:35:14,350 --> 01:35:15,950
That's why he stayed?

1182
01:35:16,830 --> 01:35:18,530
That's not enough.

1183
01:35:21,370 --> 01:35:22,250
It seldom is.

1184
01:35:25,690 --> 01:35:27,410
He's like, I like the wind.

1185
01:35:29,050 --> 01:35:36,550
Bro, bro, this is, it's like putting a goldfish in a
fucking, like those like circle, like mini-ass goldfish

1186
01:35:36,550 --> 01:35:37,130
tanks.

1187
01:35:39,510 --> 01:35:41,390
There's nowhere to swim, bro.

1188
01:35:41,630 --> 01:35:43,590
You're literally trapped in seaworld.

1189
01:35:46,390 --> 01:35:48,930
I don't think I freed him, but okay.

1190
01:35:49,550 --> 01:35:51,010
I guess stay willy?

1191
01:35:51,830 --> 01:35:55,390
Yeah, it's like putting the goldfish in a fish book.

1192
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:03,920
And put Never Spear Rines with the Book Captain.

1193
01:36:04,120 --> 01:36:04,520
Okay.

1194
01:36:05,940 --> 01:36:08,040
It's not even free willy anymore.

1195
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:09,240
It's stay willy.

1196
01:36:09,400 --> 01:36:19,340
what is it lamia that's nothing brother just you ever have
those moments where you wish you could go back rewrite your

1197
01:36:19,340 --> 01:36:29,080
own past enough we will continue oh man i didn't know that
he only talks when he's on the boat smell that smoke why

1198
01:36:29,080 --> 01:36:36,160
would the dwarves agree to work for the ace here in the
first place that's the heart of it eh you lied to them i

1199
01:36:36,160 --> 01:36:41,040
lied to them All right.

1200
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:45,000
Bet we could swing across that uh lift thing.

1201
01:36:46,440 --> 01:36:46,940
Gantry.

1202
01:36:47,460 --> 01:36:48,400
Where's the...

1203
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:52,940
Oh, okay, so I don't have to, I don't have to chain it.

1204
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:53,700
That's good to know.

1205
01:36:55,080 --> 01:36:57,520
All right, grab the money real quick.

1206
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:00,160
Can I break that?

1207
01:37:00,360 --> 01:37:00,660
No.

1208
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:03,620
Is there anything up here?

1209
01:37:04,240 --> 01:37:04,660
No.

1210
01:37:06,240 --> 01:37:06,760
Okay.

1211
01:37:07,240 --> 01:37:07,760
Okay.

1212
01:37:08,720 --> 01:37:09,240
Okay.

1213
01:37:13,640 --> 01:37:16,040
Not quite right.

1214
01:37:16,820 --> 01:37:17,460
No?

1215
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:20,240
What?

1216
01:37:22,660 --> 01:37:24,420
Why is there no sound?

1217
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:25,540
Wait.

1218
01:37:26,360 --> 01:37:27,920
Oh, wait, it's bugged.

1219
01:37:28,440 --> 01:37:29,580
Do you guys notice that?

1220
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:33,500
There's no sound effects.

1221
01:37:34,780 --> 01:37:35,220
Yeah.

1222
01:37:36,620 --> 01:37:37,600
He's just...

1223
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:39,120
Yeah, he's just grunting.

1224
01:37:41,540 --> 01:37:47,820
It's like It's gotta be the right spot Like this has sound
effects But moving does it

1225
01:37:51,660 --> 01:38:01,640
Those bottles I smell fuel Bet a spot from your blades Would
cause quite a boom Oh it's not shit

1226
01:38:05,960 --> 01:38:15,160
Oh Yeah like there's certain items yeah it's like grunting
asmr right now

1227
01:38:20,460 --> 01:38:24,620
okay they're so weird

1228
01:38:29,260 --> 01:38:35,880
it's literally just grunting asmr you can break through the
ground here if you found a high enough place to drop from i

1229
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:46,600
think i don't know what to do reload save and might fix it
but like where will it take me though if I reload the save

1230
01:38:46,600 --> 01:39:00,890
wait if I didn't fix it right no I don't know I was like
wondering why I felt so off I feel like I reload the save I

1231
01:39:00,890 --> 01:39:02,630
don't know where it's gonna take me

1232
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:13,840
all right save and reload should I do try it I'll try it

1233
01:39:17,700 --> 01:39:23,800
it saves at every boat dock okay let's see zoom in this one.

1234
01:39:26,240 --> 01:39:26,660
Is it?

1235
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:27,680
What time is it?

1236
01:39:28,540 --> 01:39:28,840
Yeah.

1237
01:39:38,850 --> 01:39:42,830
I was like wondering why I was like, she's grunting awfully
lot right now.

1238
01:39:43,710 --> 01:39:44,670
Okay, there we go.

1239
01:39:45,050 --> 01:39:45,490
There we go.

1240
01:39:46,410 --> 01:39:47,190
Okay, there we go.

1241
01:39:48,190 --> 01:39:50,070
Now it sounds like we're gaming now.

1242
01:39:50,970 --> 01:39:52,630
I was like, damn, that's a lot of grunting.

1243
01:39:54,150 --> 01:39:58,110
I think we could break through the ground here if you found
a high enough place to drop from.

1244
01:40:00,830 --> 01:40:01,230
Alright.

1245
01:40:01,310 --> 01:40:02,490
It fixed itself.

1246
01:40:06,490 --> 01:40:07,410
We go up here.

1247
01:40:11,110 --> 01:40:13,450
Oh my god, one of them isn't real.

1248
01:40:15,270 --> 01:40:15,850
I know it.

1249
01:40:16,470 --> 01:40:18,050
There's too many baits.

1250
01:40:18,850 --> 01:40:20,270
I know one of you ain't real.

1251
01:40:27,550 --> 01:40:29,770
I think I'm missing back there, though.

1252
01:40:32,090 --> 01:40:33,330
No, I have to go there.

1253
01:40:33,350 --> 01:40:42,720
this way okay nice

1254
01:40:46,960 --> 01:41:00,820
okay I can see why this game is 20 to 30 hours now there's a
lot of places to explore shut these rigs off themselves why

1255
01:41:00,820 --> 01:41:08,980
not you tried the ain't her yard made examples of them they
killed the dwarves can you have convince them not to I

1256
01:41:08,980 --> 01:41:18,080

1257
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:31,780
the like is this the optional way or is a mandatory way
that's fucking right I should be able to upgrade right now

1258
01:41:31,780 --> 01:41:33,760
oh my god forgot about the upgrade feature

1259
01:41:37,260 --> 01:41:47,800

Hold it for a bro that throws the enemy Weaker throws Oh!

01:42:09,610 --> 01:42:12,630
I like the sound of that Funny man.

1265
01:42:14,190 --> 01:42:16,130
I mean, I could technically upgrade everything.

1266
01:42:18,690 --> 01:42:19,870
Yeah, I'm fucking...

1267
01:42:19,870 --> 01:42:21,030
I had too much stuff.

1268
01:42:22,030 --> 01:42:23,610
I was not paying attention.

1269
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:32,760
Alright, let's see.

1270
01:42:33,140 --> 01:42:33,660
Arteus.

1271
01:42:35,020 --> 01:42:38,040
Yes, please draw pressure on you to do aggro.

1272
01:42:42,870 --> 01:42:44,170
Alright, that makes more sense.

1273
01:42:47,150 --> 01:42:49,250
Yeah, but aren't we against, like, ice people?

1274
01:42:50,830 --> 01:42:52,750
Where did it make more sense to use my ice?

1275
01:42:53,010 --> 01:42:54,310
My axe against these guys?

1276
01:42:57,450 --> 01:42:57,830
Huh?

1277
01:42:58,710 --> 01:42:59,150
Impressive.

1278
01:43:07,140 --> 01:43:08,200
How do I get over here?

1279
01:43:10,460 --> 01:43:12,480
Oh, I have to lower the...

1280
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:13,220
Lower it.

1281
01:43:16,100 --> 01:43:18,320
Wait, I'm sorry.

1282
01:43:18,440 --> 01:43:19,940
I mean, aren't they like five people?

1283
01:43:20,440 --> 01:43:21,260
Oh, hey, there's a turtle.

1284
01:43:23,240 --> 01:43:24,420
I'm like, there's a turtle.

1285
01:43:24,680 --> 01:43:25,220
Chop, chop.

1286
01:43:29,990 --> 01:43:31,430
Wait, that was nothing.

1287
01:43:31,770 --> 01:43:32,510
I thought there was loot.

1288
01:43:32,770 --> 01:43:34,330
I thought, like, it's progression.

1289
01:43:45,080 --> 01:43:46,300
Where do I go?

1290
01:43:54,730 --> 01:43:57,150
I'm a little lost now.

1291
01:44:00,840 --> 01:44:02,200
Just a little bit.

1292
01:44:02,340 --> 01:44:02,600
Oh!

1293
01:44:02,940 --> 01:44:03,740
Wait, I got it.

1294
01:44:04,060 --> 01:44:04,880
I figured it out.

1295
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:10,940
Okay, we put it down here so we can get loot.

1296
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:19,900
I figured it out.

1297
01:44:20,060 --> 01:44:20,820
I'm so smart.

1298
01:44:26,530 --> 01:44:27,270
Fucking knew it.

1299
01:44:27,310 --> 01:44:32,090
Okay, and then from here, we raised it all the way up.

1300
01:44:34,070 --> 01:44:34,470
See?

1301
01:44:34,970 --> 01:44:35,830
I'm smart.

1302
01:44:37,590 --> 01:44:39,230
And then from here...

1303
01:44:43,250 --> 01:44:46,010
We raise it all the way up.

1304
01:44:49,660 --> 01:44:50,300
Like here.

1305
01:44:52,240 --> 01:44:53,940
Uh, maybe that's two up.

1306
01:44:54,960 --> 01:44:55,760
Is that two up?

1307
01:44:58,840 --> 01:45:00,100
No, from here.

1308
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:01,160
Yeah.

1309
01:45:03,340 --> 01:45:04,380
And then...

1310
01:45:04,380 --> 01:45:05,240
We...

1311
01:45:05,240 --> 01:45:06,020
Go this way.

1312
01:45:09,970 --> 01:45:11,650
How do we get it from this way?

1313
01:45:18,170 --> 01:45:19,910
Guys, I don't think this is it.

1314
01:45:21,250 --> 01:45:22,630
I think that's two up.

1315
01:45:24,230 --> 01:45:25,190
I think...

1316
01:45:25,190 --> 01:45:27,730
Guys, I think that was a little two up, guys.

1317
01:45:29,450 --> 01:45:32,010
Oh my god, it's not even, like...

1318
01:45:32,010 --> 01:45:34,230
I don't even, like, get to go there.

1319
01:45:35,690 --> 01:45:36,170
What?

1320
01:45:39,190 --> 01:45:40,490
Where would it go?

1321
01:45:41,910 --> 01:45:42,630
Don't go.

1322
01:45:45,650 --> 01:45:46,910
Alright, I guess...

1323
01:45:48,390 --> 01:45:50,150
Yeah, that might be a little two up.

1324
01:45:52,150 --> 01:45:55,430
as we go one down

1325
01:46:00,780 --> 01:46:12,140

live in no

1326
01:46:18,070 --> 01:46:27,490

Please.

1327
01:46:28,610 --> 01:46:30,710
We have to figure out how to!

1328
01:46:34,260 --> 01:46:35,040
Oh my god.

1329
01:46:35,440 --> 01:46:36,520
Oh my god.

1330
01:46:36,660 --> 01:46:37,640
I'm so bad with puzzles.

1331
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:39,540
Fuck this one bird in particular.

1332
01:46:41,020 --> 01:46:41,600
Fuck this bird.

1333
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:44,100
I'm angry now.

1334
01:46:45,220 --> 01:46:47,460
I shall let my anger out on this bird.

1335
01:46:49,180 --> 01:46:51,320
Like, what did this bird do to me?

1336
01:46:51,700 --> 01:46:52,860
I don't care.

1337
01:46:54,660 --> 01:46:55,420
Oh, wait, wait.

1338
01:46:55,480 --> 01:46:56,300
I figured it out.

1339
01:47:01,030 --> 01:47:01,550
Okay.

1340
01:47:08,630 --> 01:47:10,470
Oh, I figured it out!

1341
01:47:11,830 --> 01:47:12,110
Okay.

1342
01:47:13,050 --> 01:47:22,950
So what we do is we lower it down and then and then this...

1343
01:47:22,950 --> 01:47:23,210
Oh.

1344
01:47:34,420 --> 01:47:34,820
Oh.

1345
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:37,620
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1346
01:47:38,420 --> 01:47:39,780
We go up here.

1347
01:47:43,900 --> 01:47:44,700
Okay.

1348
01:47:44,780 --> 01:47:47,780
Okay, that is further than I expected.

1349
01:47:49,820 --> 01:47:49,840
Um.

1350
01:47:52,140 --> 01:47:52,980
Hmm.

1351
01:47:59,700 --> 01:48:00,080
Hmm.

1352
01:48:00,780 --> 01:48:01,160
Okay.

1353
01:48:06,430 --> 01:48:06,690
Hmm.

1354
01:48:11,290 --> 01:48:11,350
Um.

1355
01:48:12,770 --> 01:48:14,650
Wait, give me a sec.

1356
01:48:15,370 --> 01:48:17,090
Oh, oh, oh, I figured it out.

1357
01:48:17,110 --> 01:48:28,510
out we push it back up and then okay look see i i just
didn't look everywhere guys i made a mistake and then we go

1358
01:48:28,510 --> 01:48:42,630
up here and then i told you i figured it out yeah but so it
wasn't so hard yeah see it wasn't so hard wait what's okay

1359
01:48:42,630 --> 01:48:44,510
we gotta put this down here

1360
01:48:47,610 --> 01:48:49,160
Or then we go back up.

1361
01:48:50,870 --> 01:48:52,530
See, it wasn't so high.

1362
01:48:54,430 --> 01:48:59,010
All right, activate this stupid boss, but...

1363
01:48:59,010 --> 01:48:59,410
All right.

1364
01:49:00,930 --> 01:49:02,110
What the?!

1365
01:49:02,110 --> 01:49:09,150
Okay, bro, okay, okay, okay, just... I said... I thought he
was supposed to aggro this.

1366
01:49:13,750 --> 01:49:14,730
That's fine.

1367
01:49:17,630 --> 01:49:19,550
Get your ass over here.

1368
01:49:20,010 --> 01:49:20,450
That's right.

1369
01:49:20,910 --> 01:49:21,740
Slab dunk tab.

1370
01:49:24,770 --> 01:49:25,390
Slab dunk!

1371
01:49:30,850 --> 01:49:31,430
Okay.

1372
01:49:32,370 --> 01:49:34,430
Oh, okay, that was sick.

1373
01:49:37,690 --> 01:49:38,770
All right, that should be everything.

1374
01:49:40,530 --> 01:49:42,370
All right, get this oil.

1375
01:49:42,670 --> 01:49:43,470
Oh, sorry, milling.

1376
01:49:43,630 --> 01:49:44,050
I'm not sorry.

1377
01:49:44,610 --> 01:49:44,610
Mining.

1378
01:49:47,110 --> 01:49:48,370
Three times the charm.

1379
01:49:48,550 --> 01:49:50,030
I figured out what it is.

1380
01:49:51,710 --> 01:49:53,370
Get this mine rig out of here.

1381
01:49:56,830 --> 01:50:01,070
Oh, I got there eventually.

1382
01:50:01,690 --> 01:50:05,430
To the blacksmiths of Svartalfine, the creation of a weapon
was a sacred thing.

1383
01:50:06,390 --> 01:50:10,270
But Odin just wanted as many blades as he could get, as fast
as he could get them.

1384
01:50:10,990 --> 01:50:15,970
With every stolen resource and mediocre blade, the dwarves
lost a bit of themselves.

1385
01:50:17,950 --> 01:50:19,950
Don't worry, we'll free them.

1386
01:50:24,530 --> 01:50:25,130
Alright.

1387
01:50:25,730 --> 01:50:26,910
No more mining for you.

1388
01:50:26,990 --> 01:50:28,390
I'll free these dwarves.

1389
01:50:29,470 --> 01:50:31,190
I'll free them from mining.

1390
01:50:33,990 --> 01:50:36,330
Then they could chase their real dreams.

1391
01:50:36,510 --> 01:50:37,650
Whatever they are.

1392
01:50:38,650 --> 01:50:41,630
Okay, but what the fuck is that up there though?

1393
01:50:43,650 --> 01:50:46,790
Like, up here there's like another thing we could do.

1394
01:50:48,110 --> 01:50:49,110
Like this.

1395
01:50:49,250 --> 01:50:58,410
seem like we can reach it from down here okay maybe i turn
it up once more the dwarf survived because of you yeah

1396
01:50:58,410 --> 01:51:06,250
they're real dreams odin would have wiped out every last
dwarf and sparkle flame if he couldn't use their skills no

1397
01:51:06,250 --> 01:51:21,710
one could yeah what if they just want to dance and odin was
like no dancing in my realm Maybe up here, I can do it.

1398
01:51:25,250 --> 01:51:27,990
Yeah, because I'm like, obviously there's something here.

1399
01:51:29,390 --> 01:51:31,090
How do I get across from that?

1400
01:51:32,070 --> 01:51:32,970
Oh, here it is.

1401
01:51:39,340 --> 01:51:39,720
Alright.

1402
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:43,120
I knew it.

1403
01:51:44,100 --> 01:51:46,680
My exploration senses were tingling.

1404
01:51:48,100 --> 01:51:48,700
There you go.

1405
01:51:50,680 --> 01:51:51,320
Yeah!

1406
01:51:51,800 --> 01:51:52,180
Loot!

1407
01:51:52,820 --> 01:51:54,280
Oh, nice.

1408
01:51:54,660 --> 01:51:55,340
Where's the loot?

1409
01:51:56,220 --> 01:51:57,280
Wait, this is not the loot.

1410
01:51:58,320 --> 01:51:59,220
Oh, there it is.

1411
01:51:59,740 --> 01:52:00,520
There's my loot.

1412
01:52:07,960 --> 01:52:08,720
Oh, nice.

1413
01:52:08,860 --> 01:52:09,660
I got runic.

1414
01:52:13,020 --> 01:52:14,600
Alright, we can leave now.

1415
01:52:15,200 --> 01:52:15,440
Boy.

1416
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:16,940
Boy!

1417
01:52:17,820 --> 01:52:19,060
We can go!

1418
01:52:21,940 --> 01:52:22,620
Alright.

1419
01:52:23,360 --> 01:52:25,520
Off to another mining rig.

1420
01:52:26,440 --> 01:52:27,240
For more loot.

1421
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:43,340
oh your teeth is up that that that is not healthy for a
whale oh used as wisdom and might to imprison some of the

1422
01:52:43,340 --> 01:52:53,580
most dangerous creatures and all that we gotta send this
whale to a dentist what is a little tunnel hello little

1423
01:52:53,580 --> 01:52:59,160
tunnel Yeah, we gotta call a dentist for that guy.

1424
01:53:00,680 --> 01:53:02,840
That is not healthy teeth right there.

1425
01:53:10,860 --> 01:53:12,480
One more mining ring.

1426
01:53:12,860 --> 01:53:13,420
Since that cranks the worst.

1427
01:53:16,840 --> 01:53:17,880
We'll crank.

1428
01:53:18,540 --> 01:53:19,240
Oh, barrel.

1429
01:53:22,040 --> 01:53:23,760
Yeah, there's no plankton for him.

1430
01:53:24,660 --> 01:53:26,240
To help with his teeth.

1431
01:53:28,160 --> 01:53:36,380
smell the smoke there's another mining rig here you speak of
your deeds with shame do you regret not allowing Odin to

1432
01:53:36,380 --> 01:53:49,880
kill them are doing oh my god they're fire I was like don't
worry I shall fight fire with fire I don't get it the doors

1433
01:53:49,880 --> 01:53:57,640
weren't chained up like the Lumbacher couldn't they quit and
do what their newly built fortress poisoned the spot on

1434
01:53:57,640 --> 01:54:07,980
unable to grow their own food they had to buy it from asgard
oh they'd be taking food out of their own mouths yeah that's

1435
01:54:07,980 --> 01:54:22,400
clever and awful yeah they fucked up have they ever thought
about moving yeah just just move somewhere else it's just

1436
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:29,560
that easy guys just just move I love that they're like,
you're like, I hate living here.

1437
01:54:29,660 --> 01:54:31,600
And then people would be like, why are you used to live
here?

1438
01:54:31,660 --> 01:54:32,340
You know, just move.

1439
01:54:32,440 --> 01:54:39,380
And then people are like, yeah, but what about mortgages and
house paying for a new apartment, new rent, and also paying

1440
01:54:39,380 --> 01:54:43,940
for travelers and moving and finding a new job at the new
state?

1441
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:45,660
It was training.

1442
01:54:46,220 --> 01:54:47,900
You didn't have fun?

1443
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:53,460
Well, anyway, we should look for the other half of the seat.

1444
01:54:54,060 --> 01:54:56,140
Once it's whole again, we can see our elites.

1445
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:00,220
Yeah.

1446
01:55:03,720 --> 01:55:05,020
All right, just move that.

1447
01:55:07,100 --> 01:55:09,080
Yeah, oh, I hear the lizards.

1448
01:55:10,480 --> 01:55:10,700
Fucking new.

1449
01:55:10,760 --> 01:55:11,620
I heard you guys.

1450
01:55:12,520 --> 01:55:13,140
That's right.

1451
01:55:13,220 --> 01:55:16,120
I will make sure your entire kind is distinguished.

1452
01:55:20,520 --> 01:55:21,560
Oh, wait, we gotta keep this.

1453
01:55:23,380 --> 01:55:24,520
Yeah, just move forehead.

1454
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:25,200
Yeah, just move forehead.

1455
01:55:27,180 --> 01:55:30,160
Yeah, just abandon everything and live in a box for a while.

1456
01:55:30,260 --> 01:55:30,900
No problem.

1457
01:55:36,950 --> 01:55:41,250
It's not a war crime if, like, their kind don't have rights.

1458
01:55:44,410 --> 01:55:45,710
They're an invasive species.

1459
01:55:45,930 --> 01:55:47,270
It's like the iguana problem.

1460
01:55:47,830 --> 01:55:53,590
I always talk about it, but, like, apparently there's a huge
iguana problem in Florida because they're an invasive

1461
01:55:53,590 --> 01:55:56,710
species, and the mayor has put out, like, several
statements.

1462
01:55:58,450 --> 01:55:59,970
Please kill them.

1463
01:56:02,510 --> 01:56:04,110
It's like...

1464
01:56:05,130 --> 01:56:08,830
Like, we do not want them here.

1465
01:56:09,930 --> 01:56:11,210
They just keep coming.

1466
01:56:11,490 --> 01:56:12,810
Like, kill on sight.

1467
01:56:13,010 --> 01:56:13,750
Aguados.

1468
01:56:19,670 --> 01:56:22,970
Yeah, and it's been a problem for years.

1469
01:56:23,130 --> 01:56:27,830
They have been a huge problem in Florida.

1470
01:56:28,450 --> 01:56:33,330
They've been trying to kill the iguanas, but they're still
populating.

1471
01:56:37,810 --> 01:56:40,430
Bro, how are these fucking?

1472
01:56:41,510 --> 01:56:42,830
Lizard's doing so much.

1473
01:56:43,850 --> 01:56:44,730
All right, kill the source.

1474
01:56:44,890 --> 01:56:46,690
Oh, my God, it didn't kill him.

1475
01:56:49,450 --> 01:56:51,930
I'm actually surprised it did not kill him.

1476
01:56:55,050 --> 01:56:56,590
Okay, okay, buddy.

1477
01:56:56,590 --> 01:56:57,150
Chill.

1478
01:57:00,790 --> 01:57:04,050
Yeah, I don't think boars are an invasive species though.

1479
01:57:06,510 --> 01:57:08,130
Compared to iguanas.

1480
01:57:12,240 --> 01:57:13,300
Brother, I had a thought.

1481
01:57:14,080 --> 01:57:16,740
What if you took a stealthy approach to an expat?

1482
01:57:17,320 --> 01:57:19,140
Stealthy and god of what?

1483
01:57:22,520 --> 01:57:23,240
That's funny.

1484
01:57:24,100 --> 01:57:26,920
If you could call so meager a task done.

1485
01:57:28,060 --> 01:57:28,420
Are they?

1486
01:57:28,840 --> 01:57:31,240
Are Boar is actually an invasive species?

1487
01:57:31,740 --> 01:57:33,120
You must live with your deeds.

1488
01:57:33,800 --> 01:57:35,500
But do not be troubled by them, brother.

1489
01:57:35,900 --> 01:57:35,940
Oh?

1490
01:57:36,520 --> 01:57:37,340
And why not?

1491
01:57:37,940 --> 01:57:40,040
You are given an impossible problem.

1492
01:57:40,940 --> 01:57:43,440
Do not blame yourself for failing to solve it.

1493
01:57:44,020 --> 01:57:46,100
I'm sure the dwarves would feel differently.

1494
01:57:46,900 --> 01:57:48,180
This doesn't fix things.

1495
01:57:48,800 --> 01:57:48,960
No.

1496
01:57:49,080 --> 01:57:49,900
That's crazy.

1497
01:57:50,180 --> 01:57:51,460
But it is a start.

1498
01:57:53,180 --> 01:57:53,920
And a minder, brother.

1499
01:57:54,600 --> 01:57:58,040
That's Fatal Fine Slag we collected could be of considerable
use.

1500
01:57:58,060 --> 01:57:59,960
They've devastated the Midwest.

1501
01:58:00,300 --> 01:58:00,900
Holy shit.

1502
01:58:01,380 --> 01:58:02,860
They're that big of a problem?

1503
01:58:07,620 --> 01:58:09,240
What request do I...

1504
01:58:09,240 --> 01:58:09,640
Okay.

1505
01:58:11,580 --> 01:58:13,760
Do I have enough for more upgrades?

1506
01:58:15,100 --> 01:58:16,360

Yeah, I do.

1509
01:58:21,760 --> 01:58:22,840
Oh, nice.

1510
01:58:23,180 --> 01:58:24,700
No, I don't have enough for Arteus.

1511
01:58:26,620 --> 01:58:27,180

to hunting oh my oh I've heard about the monkeys with herpes

1515
01:59:03,690 --> 01:59:09,790
yeah no there it's like we're recreating planning of the
apes But we have to start with her piece.

1516
01:59:11,290 --> 01:59:12,730
Thank you, the super chat bunched up.

1517
01:59:12,910 --> 01:59:13,630
Thank you, thank you.

1518
01:59:13,990 --> 01:59:15,410
I got P though real quick.

1519
01:59:15,590 --> 01:59:16,070
I'll be right back.

1520
02:00:35,040 --> 02:00:35,960
I am back.

1521
02:00:36,780 --> 02:00:37,600
Hello, everyone.

1522
02:00:38,380 --> 02:00:39,200
Let me double check.

1523
02:00:39,300 --> 02:00:40,320
Oh, I knew it.

1524
02:00:40,600 --> 02:00:43,660
Every time I mute myself, like, my go XLR.

1525
02:00:44,120 --> 02:00:45,580
I heard, like, apparently.

1526
02:00:45,860 --> 02:00:47,140
It's the biggest thing you've ever heard.

1527
02:00:48,020 --> 02:00:49,000
I do not know.

1528
02:00:49,200 --> 02:00:53,960
Also, X Factor, Meep, Aphelion, Cap, Mike, Papa, Bite.

1529
02:00:53,980 --> 02:00:55,920
WWE 4, Solid, Medi.

1530
02:00:56,140 --> 02:00:56,860
Thank you, Mr. Bridgehead.

1531
02:00:56,940 --> 02:00:57,640
Thank you, thank you.

1532
02:00:57,980 --> 02:01:02,580
Apparently, GoXLR support has finally stopped.

1533
02:01:03,420 --> 02:01:06,760
So if you're like, oh, what a fuck are the alternatives?

1534
02:01:07,640 --> 02:01:17,460
Like, so I don't know what happened, but apparently the
GoXLR no longer has, like, support anymore.

1535
02:01:18,980 --> 02:01:21,020
Like, they just disappeared, I guess.

1536
02:01:21,800 --> 02:01:23,540
I don't know what the fuck happened.

1537
02:01:23,980 --> 02:01:29,840
But they are no longer updating GoXLR, which is crazy
because they're, like, the streamer.

1538
02:01:30,360 --> 02:01:32,820
They're literally, like, the streamer mixer.

1539
02:01:33,720 --> 02:01:36,740
And then, like, they just abandoned it.

1540
02:01:38,720 --> 02:01:41,480
I don't... I honest, I don't understand.

1541
02:01:42,060 --> 02:01:46,480
I feel like every streamer uses GoXLR because it's so
simple.

1542
02:01:46,720 --> 02:01:48,840
It's, like, baby mixer.

1543
02:01:49,360 --> 02:01:50,940
And I like that because I'm baby.

1544
02:01:52,080 --> 02:01:53,960
Yeah, but then, like, yeah, they...

1545
02:01:53,980 --> 02:01:55,240
They literally have the...

1546
02:01:55,240 --> 02:01:56,840
I guess only streamers buy-in.

1547
02:01:56,880 --> 02:01:58,600
There's not enough streamers for the market.

1548
02:01:59,220 --> 02:02:00,640
The air smells a lot cleaner.

1549
02:02:04,010 --> 02:02:06,050
No, everyone uses GoXLR.

1550
02:02:06,310 --> 02:02:07,430
Because it's so easy.

1551
02:02:07,830 --> 02:02:09,270
It's like the easiest mixer.

1552
02:02:10,670 --> 02:02:11,130
Like mixing.

1553
02:02:11,210 --> 02:02:12,510
It's like mixing for dummies.

1554
02:02:13,570 --> 02:02:14,550
And that's me.

1555
02:02:16,070 --> 02:02:16,770
It's me.

1556
02:02:16,850 --> 02:02:17,710
I'm one of them.

1557
02:02:18,610 --> 02:02:19,710
And then like...

1558
02:02:19,710 --> 02:02:21,110
And they literally just...

1559
02:02:21,110 --> 02:02:22,290
Okay, there's...

1560
02:02:22,290 --> 02:02:23,990
There's Odin watching me again.

1561
02:02:25,730 --> 02:02:27,810
Like, I don't know, they just left.

1562
02:02:28,910 --> 02:02:31,150
They're like, we will no longer provide updates.

1563
02:02:31,590 --> 02:02:32,410
I'm like, huh?

1564
02:02:33,210 --> 02:02:35,710
What do you mean you're no longer providing updates?

1565
02:02:36,630 --> 02:02:39,230
Mir, what's the deal with Odin's ravens?

1566
02:02:39,950 --> 02:02:41,410
They can just transport him anywhere?

1567
02:02:41,870 --> 02:02:44,610
Except for the realm between realms, thankfully.

1568
02:02:45,170 --> 02:02:45,490
Why?

1569
02:02:45,990 --> 02:02:51,070
Harder to find, thanks to Dwarven Enchantments and
Iggdrasil's very own nature.

1570
02:02:51,670 --> 02:02:53,130
Hmm, lucky us.

1571
02:02:54,170 --> 02:02:55,470
We going to Dirlins?

1572
02:02:55,730 --> 02:02:58,070
Hope you'll be happy we fix those rakes.

1573
02:03:00,310 --> 02:03:01,650
Alright, here I go.

1574
02:03:03,270 --> 02:03:04,370
It's a hardware.

1575
02:03:05,330 --> 02:03:06,090
And a software.

1576
02:03:07,150 --> 02:03:07,710
It's both.

1577
02:03:07,970 --> 02:03:09,050
There's the safety office.

1578
02:03:09,590 --> 02:03:11,630
Well, the signer here's breaded away from that.

1579
02:03:11,630 --> 02:03:12,970
I'm going to grab that real quick.

1580
02:03:15,470 --> 02:03:17,150
But sorry, I gotta grab that loot.

1581
02:03:17,270 --> 02:03:18,830
I see loot and I must grab it.

1582
02:03:20,690 --> 02:03:23,170
Yeah, I don't know idea why they abandoned it.

1583
02:03:25,730 --> 02:03:42,010

And now like Paramount is like being like this is illegal.

1591
02:04:31,070 --> 02:04:32,450
They don't know what's good for them.

1592
02:04:33,790 --> 02:04:35,570
They're just blinded by Netflix.

1593
02:04:43,080 --> 02:04:44,400
Was it eight?

1594
02:04:44,460 --> 02:04:45,820

Elect on something, pal.

1604
02:06:00,490 --> 02:06:05,770
Think, uh, providing a severed head around on your hip is
going to scare me into somehow approving Esther's accretion

1605
02:06:05,770 --> 02:06:06,530
proposal, eh?

1606
02:06:08,390 --> 02:06:10,670
We are looking for a prisoner of Odin's.

1607
02:06:10,790 --> 02:06:13,950
Yeah, they all suck, but I think Paramount sucks more than
Warner Brothers.

1608
02:06:14,230 --> 02:06:15,090
Friends of ours said that you could help.

1609
02:06:15,210 --> 02:06:15,930
Where did you get...

1610
02:06:21,170 --> 02:06:23,730
You chop her head off with that too, eh?

1611
02:06:24,090 --> 02:06:24,610
Oh.

1612
02:06:24,790 --> 02:06:25,650

02:07:04,920 --> 02:07:11,020
rest of them all The ones left alive have to pay the price.

1616
02:07:12,880 --> 02:07:16,400
I'm afraid I can't help you with your little prisoner
situation.

1617
02:07:17,260 --> 02:07:19,780
But he could have answers on how to stop Odin.

1618
02:07:20,580 --> 02:07:22,260
And free swallowfine from the Ace here.

1619
02:07:22,540 --> 02:07:25,160
I'm not in the business of crushing the old father anymore.

1620
02:07:27,140 --> 02:07:29,080
Why is he in the business for it?

1621
02:07:29,120 --> 02:07:30,280
What even is this business?

1622
02:07:31,720 --> 02:07:33,520
He sells books?

1623
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:44,560
on it.

1624
02:07:45,720 --> 02:07:46,420
Oh, freeing!

1625
02:07:47,040 --> 02:07:48,240
Wait, that's so smart.

1626
02:07:48,980 --> 02:07:49,540
What is it?

1627
02:07:49,580 --> 02:07:50,020
A fine?

1628
02:07:51,060 --> 02:07:51,660
A fine?

1629
02:07:52,720 --> 02:07:53,140
A fine?

1630
02:07:55,020 --> 02:07:59,100
He did an uprising and then the all-fotter made him a
fucking...

1631
02:07:59,740 --> 02:08:01,700
For fucking up my desk!

1632
02:08:02,440 --> 02:08:03,000
Fine.

1633
02:08:05,960 --> 02:08:07,060
Play it at your leisure.

1634
02:08:07,540 --> 02:08:07,740
Okay.

1635
02:08:08,400 --> 02:08:12,700
Wait, he did an uprising and then the all-fotter made him a
fucking...

1636
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:14,480
Audit?

1637
02:08:14,960 --> 02:08:15,380
An auditor?

1638
02:08:23,030 --> 02:08:23,650
That's crazy.

1639
02:08:24,110 --> 02:08:24,490
Hey there, Joe.

1640
02:08:24,830 --> 02:08:25,350
What about...

1641
02:08:25,350 --> 02:08:26,970
Get out of my office?

1642
02:08:27,330 --> 02:08:28,370
Don't you understand?

1643
02:08:29,670 --> 02:08:30,310
You said...

1644
02:08:30,310 --> 02:08:31,870
No wonder everyone hates him.

1645
02:08:33,450 --> 02:08:34,930
Oh, uh, sure.

1646
02:08:36,070 --> 02:08:38,670
It gave this man a white-collar job.

1647
02:08:44,150 --> 02:08:47,610
The ultimate punishment bureaucracy.

1648
02:08:47,850 --> 02:08:48,150
Yeah.

1649
02:08:50,090 --> 02:08:52,050
He made him a bureaucrat.

1650
02:08:54,050 --> 02:08:55,450
I beg your pardon.

1651
02:08:57,110 --> 02:08:58,210
What a monster.

1652
02:08:58,410 --> 02:08:59,650
Dina, would you get a load of this?

1653
02:09:00,690 --> 02:09:02,770
It looks a little familiar too.

1654
02:09:03,290 --> 02:09:05,610
I've just got one of those faces.

1655
02:09:05,750 --> 02:09:06,770
Their name is Dina.

1656
02:09:07,110 --> 02:09:08,750
Seems to me that's the only thing you've got.

1657
02:09:09,470 --> 02:09:12,150
The ultimate prison of nine to five.

1658
02:09:13,990 --> 02:09:17,050
He gave him a nine to five job.

1659
02:09:17,770 --> 02:09:18,290
No!

1660
02:09:21,010 --> 02:09:22,970
Hey, this isn't a fine.

1661
02:09:23,330 --> 02:09:23,710
Not now.

1662
02:09:23,970 --> 02:09:24,990
There are enemies ahead.

1663
02:09:26,830 --> 02:09:28,110
That's unfortunate.

1664
02:09:33,070 --> 02:09:34,290
Alright, nice.

1665
02:09:36,130 --> 02:09:37,150
No, it's so true.

1666
02:09:41,330 --> 02:09:42,110
It's okay.

1667
02:09:42,430 --> 02:09:43,290
Oh, never mind.

1668
02:09:43,470 --> 02:09:43,650
Hello.

1669
02:09:45,050 --> 02:09:45,910
It's alright.

1670
02:09:46,170 --> 02:09:47,610
You thought I missed you?

1671
02:09:51,510 --> 02:09:54,230
There you go.

1672
02:09:55,130 --> 02:09:55,610
Bam!

1673
02:09:57,790 --> 02:09:58,830
Okay, where is he?

1674
02:09:58,930 --> 02:10:00,090
Oh, what the fuck?

1675
02:10:03,190 --> 02:10:03,950
Oh, shit.

1676
02:10:05,490 --> 02:10:05,970
That's right.

1677
02:10:06,070 --> 02:10:07,050
Get out of here!

1678
02:10:07,270 --> 02:10:08,150
Alright, this guy.

1679
02:10:10,050 --> 02:10:11,770
I have to go up and kill you.

1680
02:10:12,710 --> 02:10:14,990
Oh, you thought hot ground makes you safe?

1681
02:10:15,270 --> 02:10:16,330
That's fucking right.

1682
02:10:19,710 --> 02:10:29,350
I am high ground Oh my god, there's so many oh Shit, I did
not realize I have so little HP now

1683
02:10:32,690 --> 02:10:36,430
Oh shit, whoops Fuck it.

1684
02:10:36,550 --> 02:10:36,890
It's fine.

1685
02:10:37,050 --> 02:10:48,150
I have to be angry anyway That's fine Just some extra anger
Some extra HP

1686
02:10:51,870 --> 02:10:54,210
All right, get over here!

1687
02:10:56,350 --> 02:10:57,170
Okay, nice.

1688
02:10:58,850 --> 02:10:59,830
Where's the last guy?

1689
02:11:01,070 --> 02:11:03,710
All right, it has to be the last guy, right?

1690
02:11:03,930 --> 02:11:04,230
Nope.

1691
02:11:05,450 --> 02:11:05,690
All right.

1692
02:11:05,870 --> 02:11:06,570
The alpha.

1693
02:11:07,410 --> 02:11:08,130
The alpha?

1694
02:11:08,970 --> 02:11:10,630
How many alphas are there?

1695
02:11:10,970 --> 02:11:14,030
If they're all alphas, boy, they can't all be alphas.

1696
02:11:14,790 --> 02:11:15,950
Then there's no alphas.

1697
02:11:21,180 --> 02:11:29,940
all right yeah I know I could turn it off but I just just
I've just went with it okay I had low HP anyway I think

1698
02:11:29,940 --> 02:11:38,800
Darlene wrote down direction the dwarf has given us a map oh
so the all fighter wouldn't know it seems to lead to a mine

1699
02:11:38,800 --> 02:11:49,440
beyond that mountain not everyone uses axes and arrows to
fight oh that's smart.

1700
02:11:49,860 --> 02:11:51,760
It's because the all-father is always watching.

1701
02:11:54,740 --> 02:11:56,060
So he, like, faked it.

1702
02:11:59,620 --> 02:12:00,880
He rage-baited.

1703
02:12:02,680 --> 02:12:07,420
Yeah, he tried to rage-bait me with bureaucracy, and it
almost worked.

1704
02:12:14,610 --> 02:12:15,510
Alright, let's see.

1705
02:12:15,550 --> 02:12:16,490
We got Rahad.

1706
02:12:18,030 --> 02:12:18,770
Where'd I go?

1707
02:12:21,190 --> 02:12:21,670
168.

1708
02:12:23,890 --> 02:12:25,490
Wait, there's something over there.

1709
02:12:25,630 --> 02:12:27,030
How do I get there, though?

1710
02:12:29,030 --> 02:12:30,550
What the fuck?

1711
02:12:31,150 --> 02:12:31,770
Oh, boat.

1712
02:12:33,770 --> 02:12:36,910
Okay, we gotta row, row, row the boat somewhere.

1713
02:12:38,070 --> 02:12:38,750
I go back?

1714
02:12:39,090 --> 02:12:39,870
Can I go back?

1715
02:12:40,210 --> 02:12:41,210
Oh, I can go back.

1716
02:12:41,270 --> 02:12:42,370
Wait, actually, no.

1717
02:12:43,130 --> 02:12:45,210
It should be going somewhere here, right?

1718
02:12:46,370 --> 02:12:48,190
There's no way I backtrack it.

1719
02:12:52,850 --> 02:12:53,690
Do I?

1720
02:12:53,690 --> 02:12:53,890
What?

1721
02:12:57,960 --> 02:13:00,400
Do I backtrack or is there somewhere to go here?

1722
02:13:04,400 --> 02:13:07,060
I feel like this is all dead ends though.

1723
02:13:08,200 --> 02:13:12,920
I was like, why would it take me here?

1724
02:13:13,760 --> 02:13:16,200
And then like, yeah, there has to be somewhere to go.

1725
02:13:16,320 --> 02:13:18,120
Because like, why would they fucking take me here?

1726
02:13:18,740 --> 02:13:20,740
And then be like, JK, you gotta go back.

1727
02:13:20,840 --> 02:13:21,720
Oh, I fucking knew it.

1728
02:13:21,740 --> 02:13:22,160
There you go.

1729
02:13:22,460 --> 02:13:23,000
There's a door.

1730
02:13:27,150 --> 02:13:28,930
No, I'm the god of boy now.

1731
02:13:29,850 --> 02:13:32,550
I'm a god of... I'm god of dads.

1732
02:13:35,150 --> 02:13:37,090
This thing looks like it can take us up the mountain.

1733
02:13:37,890 --> 02:13:39,730
Maybe we'll be able to see a mine up there.

1734
02:13:40,010 --> 02:13:42,850
Ah, nothing quite like a dwarven train ride.

1735
02:13:44,850 --> 02:13:45,810
He's retired.

1736
02:13:54,350 --> 02:13:56,130
He's a retired man!

1737
02:13:57,130 --> 02:13:59,510
That's the child to take care of now.

1738
02:14:04,670 --> 02:14:05,790
How the fuck do I get that?

1739
02:14:09,680 --> 02:14:12,360
Oh, I have this, like, an ability that I don't have yet.

1740
02:14:16,110 --> 02:14:18,030
Don't worry about that great gravestone.

1741
02:14:18,210 --> 02:14:19,410
Oh, does that mean I have to backtrack?

1742
02:14:19,730 --> 02:14:21,530
That means I'll never come back.

1743
02:14:23,170 --> 02:14:24,530
I'll never worry.

1744
02:14:33,240 --> 02:14:35,540
It's funny you think I'll come back.

1745
02:14:38,260 --> 02:14:40,940
A little car ride with my boy.

1746
02:14:43,280 --> 02:14:44,020
Choo-choo.

1747
02:14:46,060 --> 02:14:53,140
say it brother it was written all over his face uh well
burned i should say into his head he was driving this thing

1748
02:14:53,140 --> 02:15:01,700
bourbon engineering to warrant swift and enduring
retribution he is a captain of odin i and the bearer of

1749
02:15:01,700 --> 02:15:08,860
galahorn the true believer that one there are a few things
so dangerous in a man as lack of doubt a good soldier

1750
02:15:08,860 --> 02:15:10,280
follows orders

1751
02:15:15,830 --> 02:15:21,190
come on I can't wait to get better.

1752
02:15:21,230 --> 02:15:22,450
Let's look for a way to get over there.

1753
02:15:22,790 --> 02:15:23,930
Being sick sucks.

1754
02:15:24,770 --> 02:15:27,890
You know, maybe finding tears are best protection.

1755
02:15:28,930 --> 02:15:30,890
Seems like Odin really didn't want us to find one.

1756
02:15:31,650 --> 02:15:36,490
Once tears free and can be god of war again, Odin won't have
time to worry about us.

1757
02:15:36,690 --> 02:15:39,950
If that is his war to fight, he may have it.

1758
02:15:40,750 --> 02:15:42,590
Look that one bug in particular.

1759
02:15:44,730 --> 02:15:46,430
Look, the crow lived.

1760
02:15:48,770 --> 02:16:01,650
lived okay that means god wanted him to live it was god's
fate to be fair he is the god but you he is the god

1761
02:16:01,650 --> 02:16:15,110
activated but yes likely one belonging to barry the dwarf
builder of the great hall lure what a magic thingy oh god

1762
02:16:15,110 --> 02:16:15,970
not these

1763
02:16:19,670 --> 02:16:21,550
Fuck mother for the ass, dude.

1764
02:16:23,270 --> 02:16:25,010
Fuck that crow in particular.

1765
02:16:25,150 --> 02:16:25,430
You know what?

1766
02:16:25,570 --> 02:16:26,830
Fuck everything around here.

1767
02:16:30,370 --> 02:16:31,030
Oh, fuck.

1768
02:16:31,350 --> 02:16:32,590
Where is it?

1769
02:16:32,870 --> 02:16:35,390
Oh, it's not doable.

1770
02:16:35,450 --> 02:16:37,150
This one is not doable yet.

1771
02:16:40,540 --> 02:16:41,420
Oh, there it is.

1772
02:16:43,380 --> 02:16:44,540
Oh, my God.

1773
02:16:44,580 --> 02:16:45,680
It is actually not doable.

1774
02:16:45,880 --> 02:16:47,500
I'm like, you fucking stupid.

1775
02:16:47,560 --> 02:16:48,040
Yes, it is.

1776
02:16:48,160 --> 02:16:49,200
And it was not doable.

1777
02:16:50,140 --> 02:16:50,860
He was right.

1778
02:16:55,800 --> 02:16:57,600
Oh, it's a crocodile.

1779
02:17:01,660 --> 02:17:03,020
There's a blue crocodile.

1780
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:05,120
Whoa, is that a Trekkie?

1781
02:17:05,640 --> 02:17:06,260
What happened here?

1782
02:17:06,560 --> 02:17:07,360
Use caution.

1783
02:17:08,100 --> 02:17:08,760
I think it's dead.

1784
02:17:09,780 --> 02:17:10,260
Yeah?

1785
02:17:10,940 --> 02:17:12,020
Definitely dead.

1786
02:17:13,060 --> 02:17:14,140
But who killed it?

1787
02:17:14,980 --> 02:17:16,920
Hey, surely it died of old age, right?

1788
02:17:17,320 --> 02:17:17,740
Oh!

1789
02:17:18,820 --> 02:17:21,240
Oh, that's a bigger, bigger guy.

1790
02:17:22,440 --> 02:17:23,080
Oh, no.

1791
02:17:23,840 --> 02:17:27,460
Oh no, I should not have fucking wasted that.

1792
02:17:29,860 --> 02:17:30,980
Oh, did you see that?

1793
02:17:31,220 --> 02:17:34,520
I told you it looks so cool when I get it.

1794
02:17:37,860 --> 02:17:38,840
I told you.

1795
02:17:40,440 --> 02:17:43,940
It looks so cool if what I do eventually get it.

1796
02:17:49,180 --> 02:17:49,780
Okay.

1797
02:17:50,280 --> 02:17:52,420
Oh my god, fuck yes, I'm using the axe.

1798
02:17:54,820 --> 02:17:55,280
Okay.

1799
02:17:56,340 --> 02:17:56,860
Oh, wait.

1800
02:17:58,900 --> 02:17:59,520
There we go.

1801
02:17:59,880 --> 02:18:00,200
Bam!

1802
02:18:00,580 --> 02:18:01,180
Sick pain!

1803
02:18:01,440 --> 02:18:02,040
That's fucking right.

1804
02:18:02,140 --> 02:18:02,660
Oh, shit.

1805
02:18:05,580 --> 02:18:06,400
Oh, my God.

1806
02:18:06,520 --> 02:18:07,800
He just keeps slapping me.

1807
02:18:11,540 --> 02:18:12,000
Okay.

1808
02:18:12,080 --> 02:18:13,600
He has the...

1809
02:18:13,600 --> 02:18:14,560
Fucking knew it.

1810
02:18:15,380 --> 02:18:15,960
That's right.

1811
02:18:15,980 --> 02:18:16,280
It's okay.

1812
02:18:16,400 --> 02:18:18,100
It just hurt the boy, not me.

1813
02:18:18,840 --> 02:18:19,700
I'm fine, though.

1814
02:18:22,820 --> 02:18:23,740
Oh, fuck.

1815
02:18:23,840 --> 02:18:28,120
I am no longer fine.

1816
02:18:28,640 --> 02:18:30,740
I am no longer fine.

1817
02:18:30,960 --> 02:18:32,000
I am.

1818
02:18:33,460 --> 02:18:34,520
Oh my god.

1819
02:18:35,560 --> 02:18:36,440
Oh my god.

1820
02:18:36,760 --> 02:18:37,020
Okay, okay.

1821
02:18:37,200 --> 02:18:39,080
Let me focus up.

1822
02:18:39,840 --> 02:18:41,920
This guy is scary.

1823
02:18:44,940 --> 02:18:45,920
Jesus Christ.

1824
02:18:51,260 --> 02:18:51,840
Oh my god.

1825
02:18:52,040 --> 02:18:53,640
Okay, that's not fair.

1826
02:18:53,760 --> 02:18:55,660
I was in the middle of my attack.

1827
02:18:55,680 --> 02:18:58,220
Oh my god.

1828
02:18:58,440 --> 02:19:00,460
Okay, I'm doing a worse run right now.

1829
02:19:03,380 --> 02:19:05,220
Are you fucking kidding me?

1830
02:19:07,680 --> 02:19:08,280
Bro!

1831
02:19:10,420 --> 02:19:12,020
Oh my god!

1832
02:19:12,200 --> 02:19:13,420
Okay, this is not fair.

1833
02:19:14,320 --> 02:19:16,000
Now it's not fair.

1834
02:19:16,880 --> 02:19:17,540
That's it.

1835
02:19:19,620 --> 02:19:20,580
There we go.

1836
02:19:20,860 --> 02:19:21,420
Fuck you.

1837
02:19:23,780 --> 02:19:25,660
Okay, there has to be like...

1838
02:19:29,440 --> 02:19:30,600
Okay, that's fine.

1839
02:19:32,180 --> 02:19:32,780
What?

1840
02:19:33,120 --> 02:19:34,000
That is not fine!

1841
02:19:36,560 --> 02:19:38,760
Okay, we might be fucked up.

1842
02:19:39,040 --> 02:19:39,340
Unlucky.

1843
02:19:42,720 --> 02:19:44,620
Where the fuck is the his?

1844
02:19:45,820 --> 02:19:47,280
Like, where are the his?

1845
02:19:50,520 --> 02:19:52,300
Yeah, this guy is strong.

1846
02:19:53,580 --> 02:19:54,280
The alpha.

1847
02:19:55,680 --> 02:20:08,460

There you go.

1851
02:20:30,340 --> 02:20:31,700
I'm fucking grabbing this, though.

1852
02:20:34,860 --> 02:20:35,600
It's okay.

1853
02:20:36,920 --> 02:20:37,440
It's okay.

1854
02:20:40,120 --> 02:20:41,060
Oh, he missed.

1855
02:20:42,260 --> 02:20:44,220
Oh my god, he didn't miss that, though.

1856
02:20:46,460 --> 02:20:47,960
Yeah, fucking I don't!

1857
02:20:48,220 --> 02:20:48,600
Oh god.

1858
02:20:49,040 --> 02:20:49,520

get the parries so we're i'm starting to figure out the

1866
02:22:03,350 --> 02:22:17,050
timing very slowly i'm figuring it out what a good
father-son bonding moment i have with my son here teach him

1867
02:22:17,050 --> 02:22:26,970
how to be a man that has to be what darlin was talking about
down there that is so far father what if a war with odin

1868
02:22:26,970 --> 02:22:30,030
isn't just tears to fight What if it's ours too?

1869
02:22:30,030 --> 02:22:30,530
It's not.

1870
02:22:31,150 --> 02:22:31,630
We're not.

1871
02:22:31,770 --> 02:22:32,790
We're not Norse.

1872
02:22:33,650 --> 02:22:34,710
We're gods.

1873
02:22:35,870 --> 02:22:36,410
Better gods.

1874
02:22:36,910 --> 02:22:38,290
We're trying to stop Ragnar.

1875
02:22:38,290 --> 02:22:39,170
Better gods.

1876
02:22:40,470 --> 02:22:42,310
And what if the only way to do that is war?

1877
02:22:42,570 --> 02:22:42,850
Let's raise.

1878
02:22:43,110 --> 02:22:46,190
Technically he's the only god left for his realm.

1879
02:22:47,770 --> 02:22:52,270
He literally killed all the gods and then be like, oh, time
to...

1880
02:22:52,270 --> 02:22:54,990
I guess I live in the Norse area now.

1881
02:22:56,890 --> 02:22:58,690
I guess I live here now.

1882
02:22:58,710 --> 02:23:01,110
because I killed all the gods.

1883
02:23:01,730 --> 02:23:06,460
What do I do?

1884
02:23:08,080 --> 02:23:09,620
I'm sure you lost, yeah.

1885
02:23:14,960 --> 02:23:18,400
Okay, I know I have to go up, but what if I go down?

1886
02:23:18,580 --> 02:23:20,800
I know I have to go down, but what if I go up?

1887
02:23:26,640 --> 02:23:28,100
Aphrodite is still alive.

1888
02:23:28,220 --> 02:23:29,460
What the fuck is she gonna do?

1889
02:23:29,660 --> 02:23:30,720
Like, there's no other...

1890
02:23:30,720 --> 02:23:31,480
It's just her.

1891
02:23:40,140 --> 02:23:43,020
Like, she can't fucking repopulate the gods.

1892
02:23:43,360 --> 02:23:44,800
The gods back there.

1893
02:23:46,760 --> 02:23:47,980
There's no other gods.

1894
02:23:49,760 --> 02:23:51,460
All she's gonna get is demigods.

1895
02:23:51,780 --> 02:23:54,080
And they're practically, they're like barely gods.

1896
02:23:57,980 --> 02:24:02,400
How can she repopulate if all the other gods are dead except
for Kratos?

1897
02:24:02,920 --> 02:24:05,860
I don't think Kratos would wanna stick his pee-pee in her.

1898
02:24:12,910 --> 02:24:27,370
I don't think he wants to get near crazy well yeah but he's
different now that was during his crazy psycho killing era

1899
02:24:27,370 --> 02:24:45,880
yeah but but he's matured now guys he's matured he's learned
I can't go there oh my thighs are just not thick enough to

1900
02:24:45,880 --> 02:24:56,880
jump through that fucking jump through that oh this works
though apparently oh yeah the longer jump works

1901
02:25:01,240 --> 02:25:06,420
oh wow okay okay

1902
02:25:10,370 --> 02:25:18,470
he's like no i cannot do such short jump that jump it's way
too much for my legs Oh shit.

1903
02:25:22,170 --> 02:25:22,730
Alright.

1904
02:25:23,410 --> 02:25:23,710
Alright.

1905
02:25:23,710 --> 02:25:25,250
Oh my god, the fucking house.

1906
02:25:26,270 --> 02:25:27,350
Oh, I destroyed the house.

1907
02:25:28,590 --> 02:25:32,390
Bro, okay, did my son shot me?

1908
02:25:34,470 --> 02:25:35,510
Alright, there you go.

1909
02:25:37,690 --> 02:25:39,690
He needed pink to jump.

1910
02:25:40,950 --> 02:25:42,450
Fixed a broken train.

1911
02:25:42,750 --> 02:25:43,430
Oh, I'll fix it.

1912
02:25:43,750 --> 02:25:45,690
Looks like we have to get this one back on the tracks.

1913
02:25:47,810 --> 02:25:48,850
There you go.

1914
02:25:49,070 --> 02:25:49,810
I fixed it.

1915
02:25:53,970 --> 02:25:55,650
Just cut it off.

1916
02:25:56,470 --> 02:25:57,710
All better now.

1917
02:26:02,310 --> 02:26:02,870
Yeah.

1918
02:26:05,110 --> 02:26:06,630
That's how you fix it.

1919
02:26:07,530 --> 02:26:08,490
I'm an engineer.

1920
02:26:10,350 --> 02:26:10,390
Okay.

1921
02:26:11,150 --> 02:26:11,850
We need to go left.

1922
02:26:15,530 --> 02:26:15,570
Left.

1923
02:26:16,710 --> 02:26:17,030
That's it.

1924
02:26:17,930 --> 02:26:18,510
Is that left?

1925
02:26:18,730 --> 02:26:19,450
I meant my left.

1926
02:26:19,730 --> 02:26:20,150
Oh, okay.

1927
02:26:20,310 --> 02:26:22,410
Yeah, I was gonna say, I was like, I don't think that's
left.

1928
02:26:25,830 --> 02:26:26,990
We're so close.

1929
02:26:27,270 --> 02:26:28,350
Just a little to the left.

1930
02:26:29,130 --> 02:26:29,190
What?

1931
02:26:30,570 --> 02:26:32,390
Boy, you're making me angry, boy.

1932
02:26:32,630 --> 02:26:33,270
Yeah, that's it.

1933
02:26:33,590 --> 02:26:36,390
I was gonna say, boy, I swear to God.

1934
02:26:38,010 --> 02:26:39,590
You're making me angry.

1935
02:26:47,720 --> 02:26:50,000
It's like, there's like, the parking thing.

1936
02:26:53,160 --> 02:26:54,100
They're cracking.

1937
02:26:55,200 --> 02:26:56,500
Oh, uh, Diner.

1938
02:26:57,320 --> 02:26:58,460
Yeah, it's covered in algae.

1939
02:26:59,280 --> 02:27:01,920
I was thinking we could show it to Brock and Sindri when we
got back.

1940
02:27:06,260 --> 02:27:07,140
Okay, so.

1941
02:27:07,660 --> 02:27:10,320
We came here looking for Tyr because we don't trust Odin,
right?

1942
02:27:10,880 --> 02:27:12,820
If you think about it, War could...

1943
02:27:13,520 --> 02:27:14,100
Uh-oh.

1944
02:27:19,380 --> 02:27:20,260
Oh, shit.

1945
02:27:21,260 --> 02:27:22,000
Who is it?

1946
02:27:22,100 --> 02:27:22,820
Oh, shit!

1947
02:27:23,080 --> 02:27:23,900
Oh, fuck!

1948
02:27:24,200 --> 02:27:24,760
Whoa, okay.

1949
02:27:25,580 --> 02:27:28,200
All right Don't worry.

1950
02:27:28,320 --> 02:27:39,600

Oh!

1954
02:27:59,400 --> 02:28:00,000
Boy.

1955
02:28:03,200 --> 02:28:04,440
Boy.

1956
02:28:07,400 --> 02:28:09,880
What did you do?

1957
02:28:11,420 --> 02:28:14,960
I think because we didn't have it.

1958
02:28:15,200 --> 02:28:16,040
Oh, fuck!

1959
02:28:17,920 --> 02:28:19,160
Oh.

1960
02:28:23,400 --> 02:28:24,520
That's okay.

1961
02:28:26,200 --> 02:28:26,800
Oh.

1962
02:28:30,760 --> 02:28:31,500
All right.

1963
02:28:32,200 --> 02:28:33,460
We put him out of his misery.

1964
02:28:33,760 --> 02:28:34,440
That's nice.

1965
02:28:35,760 --> 02:28:36,200
How?

1966
02:28:36,400 --> 02:28:37,400
That was helpful.

1967
02:28:39,120 --> 02:28:41,360
I can't believe we...

1968
02:28:41,360 --> 02:28:42,120
Are you serious?

1969
02:28:43,120 --> 02:28:43,720
We...

1970
02:28:43,720 --> 02:28:44,020
Aw.

1971
02:28:45,620 --> 02:28:46,220
Nope.

1972
02:28:47,560 --> 02:28:48,160
Nope.

1973
02:28:50,260 --> 02:28:51,700
All right, nice.

1974
02:28:54,900 --> 02:28:55,500
Oh, fuck.

1975
02:28:55,700 --> 02:28:56,580
Come on, bro.

1976
02:28:56,980 --> 02:28:57,400
Are you...

1977
02:28:57,400 --> 02:28:57,420
Oh, fuck.

1978
02:28:57,420 --> 02:28:57,860
Serious?

1979
02:28:58,120 --> 02:28:59,140
Oh, that's it.

1980
02:28:59,700 --> 02:29:00,360
That's it.

1981
02:29:02,180 --> 02:29:07,420
I keep thinking he's saying alpha, but it's just another...

1982
02:29:07,420 --> 02:29:08,240
That was crazy.

1983
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:09,660
All of it.

1984
02:29:09,880 --> 02:29:11,260
We saved it, my little brother.

1985
02:29:14,460 --> 02:29:15,460
Is there anything up here?

1986
02:29:16,500 --> 02:29:18,340
I keep thinking he's like, alpha!

1987
02:29:21,300 --> 02:29:21,520
Oh.

1988
02:29:22,540 --> 02:29:23,060
Wait.

1989
02:29:23,320 --> 02:29:23,700
Hit that.

1990
02:29:23,820 --> 02:29:23,940
Oh.

1991
02:29:24,880 --> 02:29:26,240
Are you fucking serious?

1992
02:29:26,340 --> 02:29:26,920
He dodged?

1993
02:29:27,420 --> 02:29:30,740
Oh my god, he fucking just jumped over me.

1994
02:29:30,780 --> 02:29:32,940
There you go.

1995
02:29:34,440 --> 02:29:34,900
Nice.

1996
02:29:35,800 --> 02:29:36,490
Let's grab that.

1997
02:29:43,810 --> 02:29:45,830
Jesus, your enemy's everywhere.

1998
02:29:49,320 --> 02:29:50,260
There you go.

1999
02:29:52,340 --> 02:29:53,080
Oh, where?

2000
02:29:53,160 --> 02:29:53,820
Oh, there he is.

2001
02:29:54,780 --> 02:29:56,600
That's okay, my boys got it.

2002
02:29:59,980 --> 02:30:01,380
He has no HP.

2003
02:30:02,360 --> 02:30:05,120
So he can tank it as long as he can.

2004
02:30:06,460 --> 02:30:07,180
That's my boy.

2005
02:30:08,480 --> 02:30:09,760
All right, now I can loot.

2006
02:30:11,420 --> 02:30:13,400
Oh my god, there's so much shit.

2007
02:30:19,020 --> 02:30:21,800
Okay, oh, oh my god, there's this stuff here too.

2008
02:30:22,440 --> 02:30:23,420
Where do I go?

2009
02:30:24,140 --> 02:30:25,760
I'm so overwhelmed.

2010
02:30:33,980 --> 02:30:35,780
Oh my god, there's too many places to go.

2011
02:30:39,220 --> 02:30:42,560
oh my god a fucking course he was hiding down there

2012
02:30:46,400 --> 02:30:58,900
the loot was very oh my how did i miss boy i believe my boy

2013
02:30:59,800 --> 02:31:07,640
guys it was perfectly lined up if it wasn't for my boy i
could have killed him 100 percent

2014
02:31:12,160 --> 02:31:13,880
I'm okay now.

2015
02:31:17,480 --> 02:31:17,960
What?

2016
02:31:19,140 --> 02:31:19,440
What?

2017
02:31:19,860 --> 02:31:22,060
Oh my god, it's a stupid tiny lizard.

2018
02:31:23,260 --> 02:31:24,740
Oh my god, get him!

2019
02:31:26,060 --> 02:31:26,720
That's it.

2020
02:31:27,260 --> 02:31:27,640
That's it.

2021
02:31:27,700 --> 02:31:28,200
I'm just gonna...

2022
02:31:28,200 --> 02:31:29,220
Yeah, that's fucking right.

2023
02:31:35,520 --> 02:31:36,480
Alright, nice.

2024
02:31:39,020 --> 02:31:40,720
Oh my god, I'm so overwhelmed.

2025
02:31:40,860 --> 02:31:41,760
I'm like, where do I go?

2026
02:31:41,860 --> 02:31:43,660
I could go so many different places.

2027
02:31:44,360 --> 02:31:45,360
I'll go here.

2028
02:31:48,080 --> 02:31:50,480
So, quite the mouth you had on the train, lad.

2029
02:31:50,980 --> 02:31:51,820
It's just a word.

2030
02:31:52,260 --> 02:31:54,400
I've heard way worse from- Your word does not matter.

2031
02:31:55,140 --> 02:31:56,360
You lost control.

2032
02:31:56,580 --> 02:31:58,000
This is a PG game.

2033
02:31:58,900 --> 02:32:00,520
Parental guidance required.

2034
02:32:00,840 --> 02:32:03,100
It's not what you truly wish your last word to be.

2035
02:32:03,280 --> 02:32:03,920
It's shit.

2036
02:32:05,280 --> 02:32:05,840
It's a crisis.

2037
02:32:06,640 --> 02:32:07,640
Panic does nothing.

2038
02:32:08,540 --> 02:32:09,160
Harness it.

2039
02:32:09,700 --> 02:32:10,900
Let it serve you.

2040
02:32:12,740 --> 02:32:14,340
It's like, imagine, boy.

2041
02:32:14,360 --> 02:32:22,600
If your last words were shit shit shit I am disappointed

2042
02:32:35,840 --> 02:32:49,400
Look on the ground tracks he's mostly mine we'll need to get
past this cargo I Guess we go this way Oh Not here

2043
02:32:54,670 --> 02:32:56,930
How do we get past it?

2044
02:33:02,020 --> 02:33:02,220
Okay.

2045
02:33:07,240 --> 02:33:10,200
Can I freeze that water?

2046
02:33:17,550 --> 02:33:19,470
Freeze the water.

2047
02:33:20,910 --> 02:33:23,230
How do I freeze that water?

2048
02:33:29,820 --> 02:33:31,880
Think, Doki, think!

2049
02:33:34,160 --> 02:33:36,300
Can I angle this anywhere?

2050
02:33:40,760 --> 02:33:42,040
Maybe up top?

2051
02:33:46,120 --> 02:33:46,920
No.

2052
02:33:49,340 --> 02:33:49,860
Oh?

2053
02:33:52,220 --> 02:33:53,020
No.

2054
02:34:01,170 --> 02:34:03,910
By the sound of it, that's not quite right.

2055
02:34:04,610 --> 02:34:06,190
Reuse the wooden channel?

2056
02:34:08,310 --> 02:34:09,110
Oh!

2057
02:34:09,250 --> 02:34:09,490
Oh!

2058
02:34:09,510 --> 02:34:12,610
Okay, I didn't realize my fucking thing goes through the
wood.

2059
02:34:13,630 --> 02:34:13,730
Alright.

2060
02:34:19,410 --> 02:34:20,810
Okay, let's try this.

2061
02:34:23,130 --> 02:34:23,710
That's one.

2062
02:34:23,790 --> 02:34:25,290
There's a couple more near here.

2063
02:34:25,690 --> 02:34:26,490
Let's find him, yeah?

2064
02:34:28,150 --> 02:34:28,550
Alright.

2065
02:34:30,830 --> 02:34:32,010
Wait, but where do we go?

2066
02:34:32,510 --> 02:34:32,930
Here?

2067
02:34:37,740 --> 02:34:39,240
You're right, it was yellow.

2068
02:34:39,640 --> 02:34:43,640
It was like, Joki, the whole thing was yellow.

2069
02:34:43,980 --> 02:34:58,640
i was like okay you true true but it wasn't bright yellow so
can you really blame me look if it was bright yellow i would

2070
02:34:58,640 --> 02:35:01,600
have known that i should have frozen it

2071
02:35:04,620 --> 02:35:14,160
yeah read is cooperative in large scare quotes

2072
02:35:17,600 --> 02:35:21,800
I don't even know that those little Lord bits are important.

2073
02:35:23,480 --> 02:35:26,600
Like, some of them are, like, just not even Lord.

2074
02:35:28,400 --> 02:35:31,300
It's like the Pompeii Graffiti shit.

2075
02:35:32,340 --> 02:35:33,480
Wait, I'm missing one more?

2076
02:35:33,700 --> 02:35:35,640
I thought I'm fucking fired three.

2077
02:35:37,460 --> 02:35:39,100
Oh my god, this one never lit up.

2078
02:35:39,500 --> 02:35:42,060
Oh my god, it didn't light up because...

2079
02:35:44,020 --> 02:35:44,540

Where did my boy go?

2085
02:36:25,420 --> 02:36:26,440
Where did he go?

2086
02:36:28,940 --> 02:36:29,920
Oh, there he is.

2087
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:30,280
Oh, my God.

2088
02:36:30,380 --> 02:36:31,480
He literally blended in.

2089
02:36:31,540 --> 02:36:32,860
I actually did not see him.

2090
02:36:34,700 --> 02:36:37,620
He actually blended in with the fucking environment.

2091
02:36:40,260 --> 02:36:41,340
I lost him.

2092
02:36:41,820 --> 02:36:42,820
I'll head across for a better one.

2093
02:36:43,340 --> 02:36:44,260
Camouflage worked.

02:36:48,620 --> 02:36:54,080

2109
02:38:11,430 --> 02:38:12,510
Tear, tear, tear.

war?

I saw that, boy.

2117
02:39:09,920 --> 02:39:10,900
You stopped.

2118
02:39:14,600 --> 02:39:16,220
There's no thing here.

2119
02:39:16,880 --> 02:39:17,900
I'll go this way.

2120
02:39:19,800 --> 02:39:22,160
Looks like you found Darlene's mine entrance.

2121
02:39:26,930 --> 02:39:27,410
Oh, hey.

2122
02:39:29,130 --> 02:39:30,250
How did you get here?

2123
02:39:31,550 --> 02:39:32,630
Got something else?

2124
02:39:32,650 --> 02:39:33,030
for you.

2125
02:39:33,550 --> 02:39:33,610
Sindri!

2126
02:39:34,030 --> 02:39:34,710
What is it?

2127
02:39:35,050 --> 02:39:40,710
Since you're currently lacking a light source, sorry, and
have no way of seeing exactly what untold horrors lurid in

2128
02:39:40,710 --> 02:39:41,850
the dark, these will help.

2129
02:39:43,590 --> 02:39:44,850
Okay, back to your exploring now.

2130
02:39:45,070 --> 02:39:45,790
Oh, yeah!

2131
02:39:46,450 --> 02:39:46,950
Thanks, Sindri.

2132
02:39:47,270 --> 02:39:48,190
I got a flashlight.

2133
02:39:50,190 --> 02:39:52,310
Wait, what do you mean by that?

2134
02:39:52,830 --> 02:39:53,250
Oh.

2135
02:39:55,390 --> 02:39:55,870
Okay.

2136
02:39:56,910 --> 02:39:59,250
I did not like the sound of that.

2137
02:40:00,310 --> 02:40:02,570
God fucking damn it, a fucking quirk.

2138
02:40:03,230 --> 02:40:04,490
Get over here.

2139
02:40:10,310 --> 02:40:13,730
I was just like, oh, just cause...

2140
02:40:13,730 --> 02:40:14,010
Yeah?

2141
02:40:14,630 --> 02:40:15,150
Oh, yeah.

2142
02:40:15,290 --> 02:40:16,830
You thought you were so safe.

2143
02:40:17,550 --> 02:40:19,070
That's fucking right.

2144
02:40:21,770 --> 02:40:22,450
That's right.

2145
02:40:22,510 --> 02:40:23,590
You're never safe.

2146
02:40:29,090 --> 02:40:31,230
Alright, get this guy on the fucking thing.

2147
02:40:33,130 --> 02:40:34,570
Don't let him have the satisfaction.

2148
02:40:35,210 --> 02:40:36,730
Get out of here!

2149
02:40:38,410 --> 02:40:41,810
Oh my god, the tiny ass salamanders too.

2150
02:40:42,570 --> 02:40:46,390
Oh my god, just shoot him.

2151
02:40:47,670 --> 02:40:48,530
Alright, they're all dead.

2152
02:40:52,690 --> 02:40:54,450
Alright, where do I go?

2153
02:40:56,290 --> 02:40:57,750
I'm truly a dad.

2154
02:40:57,950 --> 02:40:58,930
I'm always lost.

2155
02:41:03,250 --> 02:41:04,970
I'll never know where to go.

2156
02:41:07,130 --> 02:41:10,110
Every time I go somewhere, where I'm like, where do I go?

2157
02:41:12,130 --> 02:41:15,470
Where do I go?

2158
02:41:19,030 --> 02:41:21,150
Alright, where does this...

2159
02:41:21,150 --> 02:41:22,110
Where does this go?

2160
02:41:23,630 --> 02:41:24,170
Whoa.

2161
02:41:24,310 --> 02:41:25,070
You seeing this?

2162
02:41:25,450 --> 02:41:27,310
That huge crane's moving this way.

2163
02:41:31,150 --> 02:41:32,350
Okay, but what's over here?

2164
02:41:34,690 --> 02:41:35,950
Oh, that's the goal.

2165
02:41:36,110 --> 02:41:37,590
Okay, so that's the goal.

2166
02:41:38,070 --> 02:41:40,270
Which means there might be extra stuff here.

2167
02:41:40,330 --> 02:41:40,410
Yeah.

2168
02:41:44,100 --> 02:41:44,570
Okay.

2169
02:41:46,920 --> 02:41:48,570
Okay, the crane moved.

2170
02:41:49,530 --> 02:41:52,430
And why do we care about that?

2171
02:41:54,450 --> 02:41:54,990
Okay.

2172
02:41:55,770 --> 02:41:58,310
And then where is it going?

2173
02:41:58,690 --> 02:41:59,530
Question mark.

2174
02:42:03,650 --> 02:42:08,190
So why do we care that that crane moved?

2175
02:42:11,580 --> 02:42:12,050
What?

2176
02:42:18,670 --> 02:42:24,110
oh my god i'm trying to freeze this but he's just doing a
little jumpy jumps

2177
02:42:28,010 --> 02:42:36,670
okay the crane moved again and where is it taking it oh

2178
02:42:41,130 --> 02:42:44,290
where the fuck is it taking it Oh!

2179
02:42:49,050 --> 02:42:50,170
I understand.

2180
02:42:51,650 --> 02:42:53,030
Wait, but I can't even go there.

2181
02:42:54,090 --> 02:42:55,310
Okay, but like...

2182
02:42:56,390 --> 02:43:02,410
Okay, so basically what I do, I do this.

2183
02:43:03,090 --> 02:43:03,970
Yes, sir.

2184
02:43:04,230 --> 02:43:08,670
And I do that, and then it's like the slowest elevator ride
of my life.

2185
02:43:11,270 --> 02:43:13,170
Don't worry, I'll get there.

2186
02:43:13,310 --> 02:43:19,690
eventually truly is the slowest elevator

2187
02:43:32,770 --> 02:43:44,030
yeah we're gonna start a war you think the lads to trust him
he is eager to prove himself it clouds his judgment Truly is

2188
02:43:44,030 --> 02:43:45,130
a god of war.

2189
02:43:47,950 --> 02:43:49,170
Alright, nice.

2190
02:43:49,590 --> 02:43:50,550
Dead people stuff.

2191
02:43:52,070 --> 02:43:52,090
Nice.

2192
02:43:52,550 --> 02:43:53,050
Healers.

2193
02:43:53,150 --> 02:43:53,430
Nice.

2194
02:43:53,690 --> 02:43:54,810
More dead people stuff.

2195
02:43:55,150 --> 02:43:56,330
Ripped apart by his audience.

2196
02:43:56,810 --> 02:43:58,490
Well, one member of his audience.

2197
02:43:58,990 --> 02:43:59,890
Well, Thor.

2198
02:44:04,290 --> 02:44:08,570
Tokyo, I've already finished and started a new game plus.

2199
02:44:09,270 --> 02:44:10,270
Good for you.

2200
02:44:13,610 --> 02:44:16,090
Yeah, but did you finish it the dokiway?

2201
02:44:17,570 --> 02:44:18,410
That's right.

2202
02:44:23,470 --> 02:44:25,050
You truly finish it.

2203
02:44:25,470 --> 02:44:27,610
You didn't finish it the dokiway.

2204
02:44:27,750 --> 02:44:28,450
I think this is it.

2205
02:44:29,110 --> 02:44:29,710
This is the mine.

2206
02:44:32,690 --> 02:44:33,250
Look out!

2207
02:44:33,430 --> 02:44:34,190
Oh my god.

2208
02:44:34,770 --> 02:44:35,670
Fucking fuck you.

2209
02:44:36,350 --> 02:44:37,590
Get out of here.

2210
02:44:38,210 --> 02:44:41,070
Well, looks like the official entrance to the mine is
blocked.

2211
02:44:41,730 --> 02:44:42,970
But there's gotta be another way.

2212
02:44:45,470 --> 02:44:48,990
You mean the way beside the entrance?

2213
02:44:52,290 --> 02:44:54,010
There we go.

2214
02:44:54,690 --> 02:44:55,290
What the fuck?

2215
02:44:56,850 --> 02:44:57,370
Get out of here.

2216
02:44:57,490 --> 02:44:59,570
Oh my god, it's like swatting cockroaches.

2217
02:45:02,470 --> 02:45:04,090
Bro, how are these guys a threat?

2218
02:45:04,410 --> 02:45:05,570
Where are they all coming from?

2219
02:45:06,290 --> 02:45:07,770
I don't know, their homes?

2220
02:45:08,130 --> 02:45:09,390
They live here?

2221
02:45:11,010 --> 02:45:13,290
Like... Why are there so many of them?

2222
02:45:14,250 --> 02:45:15,670
I think I can hear the water, too.

2223
02:45:15,970 --> 02:45:16,810
Slow down, Atreus.

2224
02:45:17,790 --> 02:45:18,150
Take care.

2225
02:45:19,250 --> 02:45:20,290
Be ready.

2226
02:45:25,880 --> 02:45:26,560
Oh, shit.

2227
02:45:26,760 --> 02:45:27,320
Oh, fuck.

2228
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:29,680
Oh, no.

2229
02:45:29,860 --> 02:45:31,160
We will overwhelm you quickly.

2230
02:45:31,520 --> 02:45:32,400
We gotta get him.

2231
02:45:34,040 --> 02:45:34,860
That's right!

2232
02:45:36,200 --> 02:45:36,720
Boom!

2233
02:45:37,520 --> 02:45:39,160
I'm so angry!

2234
02:45:41,540 --> 02:45:47,160
My dead wife would tell me to get therapy, and now she's
dead, so I don't need therapy no more.

2235
02:45:49,580 --> 02:45:53,800
So that means I don't need it no more, right?

2236
02:45:55,560 --> 02:45:56,960
That's what it means.

2237
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:00,760
I can't get therapy if that my wife just did.

2238
02:46:04,200 --> 02:46:05,600
That's the logic.

2239
02:46:08,040 --> 02:46:09,880
Bro, I swear to God.

2240
02:46:10,220 --> 02:46:11,860
I swear to...

2241
02:46:15,800 --> 02:46:16,560
Alright.

2242
02:46:21,300 --> 02:46:22,520
All right, here we go.

2243
02:46:22,960 --> 02:46:24,280
Now get rid of the kids.

2244
02:46:25,920 --> 02:46:27,500
Yeah, now we got rid of the children.

2245
02:46:28,300 --> 02:46:31,060
Yeah, we don't need orphans.

2246
02:46:35,640 --> 02:46:42,300
Is there anything here I missed out?

2247
02:46:44,140 --> 02:46:45,240
Wait, did I come from here?

2248
02:46:46,860 --> 02:46:47,540
Yeah, I did.

2249
02:46:48,920 --> 02:46:49,440
I did.

2250
02:46:49,600 --> 02:46:51,020
That's where I saw the trolley.

2251
02:46:52,780 --> 02:46:53,640
It's all right.

2252
02:46:54,260 --> 02:46:54,280
What?

2253
02:46:54,360 --> 02:46:56,140
And then let them become orphans?

2254
02:46:58,240 --> 02:47:00,500
They don't deserve to be in the system.

2255
02:47:01,160 --> 02:47:01,620
Guys.

2256
02:47:02,640 --> 02:47:03,880
I'm doing them a favor.

2257
02:47:06,880 --> 02:47:08,980
Okay, that's a shortcut then for later.

2258
02:47:09,840 --> 02:47:12,020
Maybe we can ride this boat thing further into the mine.

2259
02:47:12,560 --> 02:47:13,140
Worth a shot.

2260
02:47:14,120 --> 02:47:15,440
Alright, let's go to the...

2261
02:47:15,440 --> 02:47:16,220
Oh, no.

2262
02:47:16,580 --> 02:47:17,040
This...

2263
02:47:17,040 --> 02:47:17,340
Oh.

2264
02:47:17,940 --> 02:47:19,620
I do not like this...

2265
02:47:19,620 --> 02:47:20,760
This boat.

2266
02:47:20,840 --> 02:47:24,160
I know you said not to, but I can't stop thinking about
this.

2267
02:47:24,800 --> 02:47:26,380
We spend all of our time fighting bad stuff.

2268
02:47:26,700 --> 02:47:29,100
We leave them alive, they'll grow up to become Batman.

2269
02:47:29,840 --> 02:47:30,680
We do not know him.

2270
02:47:30,900 --> 02:47:31,940
We saw his shrines.

2271
02:47:32,340 --> 02:47:32,920
He's a leader.

2272
02:47:33,360 --> 02:47:35,060
He stood up to Odin when no one else would.

2273
02:47:35,680 --> 02:47:37,960
If he's done it before, why wouldn't he do it again?

2274
02:47:38,520 --> 02:47:41,280
Images from Lolland, do not tell a whole story.

2275
02:47:46,020 --> 02:47:48,540
To become a Robin, they need a Batman.

2276
02:47:48,820 --> 02:47:49,360
There's a door.

2277
02:47:49,680 --> 02:47:52,120
And we need to make sure that no Batman shows up.

2278
02:47:52,600 --> 02:48:04,240
be close oh my god there's so much here eventually i'll get
a tool to do that can't help but feel like you're angry with

2279
02:48:04,240 --> 02:48:11,780
me or something ever since we got to svardofarn you've been
critical of my every move if you don't think i can lead us

2280
02:48:11,780 --> 02:48:21,880
just say so it is not your competence that is in question
okay but what does that mean consider your intent it's

2281
02:48:21,880 --> 02:48:23,780
intent we

2282
02:48:32,500 --> 02:48:39,360
This is so much stuff.

2283
02:48:39,780 --> 02:48:40,760
Oh my god.

2284
02:48:41,080 --> 02:48:44,040
There is a lot of places to go.

2285
02:48:45,220 --> 02:48:46,400
Oh my god.

2286
02:48:46,660 --> 02:48:49,920
This is everywhere I have to explore.

2287
02:48:52,440 --> 02:48:54,180
Your question from before.

2288
02:48:54,640 --> 02:49:01,320
about my intent i intend to help the god of war stop odin
and that means freeing him from whatever prison he's in

2289
02:49:01,320 --> 02:49:09,020
right now brace yourselves friends oh hey he's back and be
careful exiting that thing one foot at a time there are

2290
02:49:09,020 --> 02:49:15,440
loose rust nails everywhere have you sure you get all your
belongings as if i would navigate this maze of running silly

2291
02:49:15,440 --> 02:49:23,920
no i'm sure you'll manage that on your own i don't know the
water looks pretty clear here keyword locks yeah yeah they

2292
02:49:23,920 --> 02:49:27,020
might be like brain-eating amoebas in there.

2293
02:49:27,800 --> 02:49:29,100
Oh, my lucky knob.

2294
02:49:31,660 --> 02:49:34,440
Uh, ooh, it's craftable, too.

2295
02:49:36,240 --> 02:49:37,440
What I have equipped?

2296
02:49:37,900 --> 02:49:38,220
Strength?

2297
02:49:40,560 --> 02:49:41,300
Hmm.

2298
02:49:48,270 --> 02:49:49,590
I don't know.

2299
02:49:52,030 --> 02:49:54,170
I'm just gonna upgrade this.

2300
02:49:58,470 --> 02:50:00,590
Oh, I can finally upgrade my blade.

2301
02:50:00,750 --> 02:50:01,310
Let's go.

2302
02:50:01,610 --> 02:50:05,470
Oh, I'm actually a disinfectant, so these are very hygienic.

2303
02:50:08,610 --> 02:50:09,030
Hmm.

2304
02:50:12,080 --> 02:50:14,270
I'm gonna craft...

2305
02:50:14,970 --> 02:50:16,430
Yeah, I'm gonna craft this.

2306
02:50:21,620 --> 02:50:22,200
Yeah.

2307
02:50:24,130 --> 02:50:25,220
We'll grab that.

2308
02:50:31,130 --> 02:50:32,330
Oh, this is new.

2309
02:50:33,970 --> 02:50:34,710
Oh,

2310
02:50:38,840 --> 02:50:39,640
but for it?

2311
02:50:39,700 --> 02:50:40,780
Oh, for...

2312
02:50:40,980 --> 02:50:41,860
The 480?

2313
02:50:42,140 --> 02:50:43,320
Wait, that's good.

2314
02:50:46,920 --> 02:50:49,100
I'll take the 480.

2315
02:50:55,890 --> 02:50:58,330
Oh, wait.

2316
02:50:58,430 --> 02:51:00,190
I gotta grab armor upgrades.

2317
02:51:00,610 --> 02:51:01,530
Want something in particular?

2318
02:51:06,390 --> 02:51:09,290
Do I want something in particular?

2319
02:51:10,070 --> 02:51:11,150
No, let's just upgrade.

2320
02:51:11,830 --> 02:51:12,510
This...

2321
02:51:12,510 --> 02:51:13,070
It fits.

2322
02:51:20,390 --> 02:51:21,570
Yeah, I should get that.

2323
02:51:21,590 --> 02:51:31,670

figure that

2325
02:51:48,560 --> 02:51:59,020
ah it should be good because you've got new armor doesn't
mean you should let yourself get knocked around more very

02:51:59,020 --> 02:52:11,580
well but i have 40 defense now what's the point all right we

I'm gonna grab my belt

2331
02:53:09,460 --> 02:53:16,740
oh my god I see it I see it I didn't see the giant ass rock
Sounds like you four, but moving along, brother.

2332
02:53:17,300 --> 02:53:17,960
What next?

2333
02:53:26,540 --> 02:53:27,040
Yeah?

2334
02:53:27,660 --> 02:53:28,120
Oh!

2335
02:53:30,520 --> 02:53:31,020
Yeah!

2336
02:53:32,420 --> 02:53:33,240
That worked.

2337
02:53:33,640 --> 02:53:34,340
Let's get to the door.

2338
02:53:34,620 --> 02:53:34,940
Come on.

2339
02:53:35,340 --> 02:53:36,820
Alright, I'm so smart.

2340
02:53:39,720 --> 02:53:41,020
And I got money here, too.

2341
02:53:41,700 --> 02:53:44,900
I need to remember to, like, hit the barrels here for a few.

2342
02:53:44,920 --> 02:53:46,340
free money.

2343
02:53:48,660 --> 02:53:49,600
I'm learning.

2344
02:53:52,320 --> 02:53:55,100
See, you can teach an old YouTuber new tricks.

2345
02:53:55,440 --> 02:53:58,120
Well, I certainly don't think this is where Tia come is.

2346
02:53:58,380 --> 02:53:59,860
He's got to be here somewhere.

2347
02:54:00,380 --> 02:54:01,420
This mine is huge.

2348
02:54:01,560 --> 02:54:05,180
Treyus, what do you intend to stop Odin from doing?

2349
02:54:05,960 --> 02:54:07,460
You speak as if you know his plan.

2350
02:54:07,840 --> 02:54:08,960
I don't know his plans.

2351
02:54:09,340 --> 02:54:10,120
That's why we're here.

2352
02:54:10,800 --> 02:54:13,400
Brothers, brothers.

2353
02:54:14,980 --> 02:54:16,320
Odin will be desperate.

2354
02:54:17,260 --> 02:54:21,220
Whatever he's planning to do surely won't be to the benefit
of anyone but himself.

2355
02:54:22,100 --> 02:54:22,480
Yeah.

2356
02:54:23,140 --> 02:54:25,100
He's a very evil man.

2357
02:54:26,480 --> 02:54:26,680
Hey, sir.

2358
02:54:26,800 --> 02:54:27,560
Thank you for the super chat.

2359
02:54:27,620 --> 02:54:27,820
Thank you.

2360
02:54:27,860 --> 02:54:29,960
I hope you can feel better soon, Doki.

2361
02:54:30,120 --> 02:54:33,640
I just got done with two bouts of bronchitis back to back so
I know how you feel.

2362
02:54:33,980 --> 02:54:34,660
You know, super chat.

2363
02:54:34,680 --> 02:54:35,280
Thank you.

2364
02:54:35,280 --> 02:54:35,580
Yeah.

2365
02:54:35,720 --> 02:54:36,940
I hope it's not bronchitis.

2366
02:54:38,580 --> 02:54:39,280
Those are the worst.

2367
02:54:39,780 --> 02:54:43,040
I haven't had been getting like the crazy coughs.

2368
02:54:43,360 --> 02:54:44,640
Like, uh, um.

2369
02:54:44,920 --> 02:54:46,920
Like the ones that we're used to getting.

2370
02:54:47,240 --> 02:54:47,780
Like, you guys seen it.

2371
02:54:47,840 --> 02:54:50,200
Like, the ones that lasted, like, several months and stuff.

2372
02:54:50,520 --> 02:54:54,120
This doesn't feel like the bronchitis coughs, luckily.

2373
02:54:57,980 --> 02:54:58,860
I hope.

2374
02:54:59,080 --> 02:54:59,580
I hope.

2375
02:55:01,260 --> 02:55:08,200
Because, like, when we had those coughs, it's like, it,
like, sounds worse than what I have now.

2376
02:55:10,400 --> 02:55:10,840
Yeah.

2377
02:55:11,880 --> 02:55:12,320
Yeah.

2378
02:55:16,280 --> 02:55:16,960
Hello.

2379
02:55:17,180 --> 02:55:18,020

Why ain't no bird?

2392
02:55:50,360 --> 02:55:51,840
But if I...

2393
02:55:51,840 --> 02:55:53,740

2394
02:55:54,300 --> 02:55:55,640
What are they down here?

2395
02:55:56,280 --> 02:55:58,700

2471
03:01:31,780 --> 03:01:33,300
Alright, I'll go through this door.

2472
03:01:33,540 --> 03:01:35,380
I have no idea where this is gonna take me.

2473
03:01:38,500 --> 03:01:39,160
Oh hey, loot!

2474
03:01:39,640 --> 03:01:39,900
Yay!

2475
03:01:41,840 --> 03:01:43,300
It's not a dead end.

2476
03:01:43,420 --> 03:01:44,480
It's not a dead end if it's...

2477
03:01:44,480 --> 03:01:45,800
I don't care if you go this way.

2478
03:01:50,220 --> 03:01:52,080
Oh, wait, but there's stuff here.

2479
03:01:56,580 --> 03:02:01,640
Uh, I have to grab a tool for that.

2480
03:02:02,220 --> 03:02:03,940
That's silly that they think I'll backtrack.

2481
03:02:07,940 --> 03:02:08,780
So silly.

2482
03:02:09,320 --> 03:02:14,000
Let's grab this.

2483
03:02:21,120 --> 03:02:22,900
And now we can go back, Arteus.

2484
03:02:23,120 --> 03:02:25,220
Now I can go back to figuring out this puzzle.

2485
03:02:26,920 --> 03:02:27,140
Alright.

2486
03:02:27,540 --> 03:02:29,720
I shall now use my brain.

2487
03:02:39,750 --> 03:02:42,250
Oh my god, I can't even kill that.

2488
03:02:43,450 --> 03:02:44,150
There we go.

2489
03:02:45,010 --> 03:02:46,130
It was worth it.

2490
03:02:48,410 --> 03:02:49,830
I go right here.

2491
03:02:50,010 --> 03:02:50,330
Oh!

2492
03:02:51,050 --> 03:02:51,610
Yeah!

2493
03:02:52,730 --> 03:02:53,850
Oh my god.

2494
03:02:55,590 --> 03:02:56,090
See?

2495
03:02:56,750 --> 03:02:57,410
See guys?

2496
03:02:58,590 --> 03:02:59,830
I used my brain.

2497
03:03:05,190 --> 03:03:07,630
Okay, and that should lower it.

2498
03:03:08,810 --> 03:03:11,070
And then that should lower it.

2499
03:03:12,250 --> 03:03:13,230
There we go.

2500
03:03:18,190 --> 03:03:19,170
Open sesame!

2501
03:03:22,170 --> 03:03:22,530
Yeah!

2502
03:03:27,850 --> 03:03:29,400
And then we grab this.

2503
03:03:31,100 --> 03:03:36,620
Let's think about how Tears probably feeling locked up in
this mine if I were imprisoned by Odin and finally freed

2504
03:03:37,160 --> 03:03:41,080
Odin would obviously be at the top of my list, but I would
just want to fight something.

2505
03:03:41,100 --> 03:03:45,040
Oh, there's loot on top of that Even if it was just to know
I still could

2506
03:03:49,920 --> 03:03:56,480
All right, there you go Secret I like how I just ignored my
son.

2507
03:03:57,320 --> 03:03:59,400
I was like yes, yes sir.

2508
03:03:59,620 --> 03:04:04,200
Yes Whatever you say, daddy's busy right now.

2509
03:04:07,700 --> 03:04:08,300
Yeah, loot.

2510
03:04:09,500 --> 03:04:09,860
Yeah.

2511
03:04:11,560 --> 03:04:12,520
Sure, boy.

2512
03:04:15,920 --> 03:04:16,700
Oh, yeah.

2513
03:04:17,080 --> 03:04:19,100
Should I have enough for his skills now?

2514
03:04:19,860 --> 03:04:21,660
I'm still level 3 locked.

2515
03:04:21,900 --> 03:04:23,440
Oh, I need axe upgrade.

2516
03:04:23,780 --> 03:04:24,680
That's why.

2517
03:04:25,380 --> 03:04:26,300
I definitely have...

2518
03:04:26,300 --> 03:04:28,540
I've not been using my blades here.

2519
03:04:29,740 --> 03:04:30,420
Okay.

2520
03:04:36,800 --> 03:04:43,140
I feel like because I'm like I feel like I'm fighting so
many I like fire enemies that I just use my axe just for

2521
03:04:43,140 --> 03:04:50,750
convenience God fucking damn it.

2522
03:04:51,910 --> 03:04:52,850
Oh my god.

2523
03:04:53,190 --> 03:04:54,350
I fucking hate these guys.

2524
03:04:55,270 --> 03:04:58,290
Oh my god I don't care if you're in danger.

2525
03:04:59,190 --> 03:05:09,490
You serve no purpose in society You're literally mosquitoes
I was like I don't care if if we kill off mosquitoes and it

2526
03:05:09,490 --> 03:05:19,570
destroys the entire ecosystems like that's the risk i'm
willing to take that's that's the risk i'm willing to take

2527
03:05:19,570 --> 03:05:32,750
if the entire if it destroys collapses the entire ecosystem
i'm like worth it is that a relic well that's my relic

2528
03:05:37,620 --> 03:05:39,800
oh Oh, shit.

2529
03:05:45,170 --> 03:05:45,650

03:05:46,090 --> 03:05:46,450
Oh, okay.

2531
03:05:52,970 --> 03:05:54,370
What the fuck?

2532
03:05:56,630 --> 03:05:56,990
Nice.

2533
03:05:57,110 --> 03:05:57,890
I didn't even have a chance.

2534
03:05:58,010 --> 03:05:59,090
Okay, what is...

2535
03:05:59,090 --> 03:05:59,870
What did I...

2536
03:05:59,870 --> 03:06:00,090
Okay.

2537
03:06:01,450 --> 03:06:05,130
Oh, Kreeza effect grants a bonus for a short duration.

2538
03:06:05,290 --> 03:06:05,870
Okay, that's good.

2539
03:06:06,490 --> 03:06:07,470
That's actually good.

2540
03:06:11,410 --> 03:06:12,150
Where's the next time?

2541
03:06:12,170 --> 03:06:13,050
Oh, fuck!

2542
03:06:13,150 --> 03:06:13,870
Where was he?

2543
03:06:14,390 --> 03:06:15,090
Oh, my.

2544
03:06:15,110 --> 03:06:16,150
I got stupid.

2545
03:06:17,010 --> 03:06:18,470
Because you know I don't look up.

2546
03:06:18,910 --> 03:06:19,490
The fucker.

2547
03:06:21,830 --> 03:06:24,830
You're so lucky I don't look up.

2548
03:06:27,670 --> 03:06:29,910
Oh my god, he dodged it?

2549
03:06:31,080 --> 03:06:31,550
That's right.

2550
03:06:31,950 --> 03:06:32,590
That's right.

2551
03:06:33,290 --> 03:06:35,250
Now you'll regret dodging it.

2552
03:06:35,910 --> 03:06:37,090
It's clinging to the wall.

2553
03:06:37,470 --> 03:06:38,050
Where?

2554
03:06:39,850 --> 03:06:41,070
Oh, there it is.

2555
03:06:44,590 --> 03:06:45,470
There you go.

2556
03:06:49,350 --> 03:06:51,370
Come on, get over here.

2557
03:06:52,590 --> 03:06:54,310
How dare they exploit my weakness?

2558
03:06:54,710 --> 03:06:55,970
Only I can do that!

2559
03:06:56,950 --> 03:06:59,110
I'm literally the main character.

2560
03:07:02,110 --> 03:07:02,630
Alright, nice.

2561
03:07:03,770 --> 03:07:04,710
I feel a breeze.

2562
03:07:05,450 --> 03:07:05,930
A breeze.

2563
03:07:07,710 --> 03:07:09,390
What the fuck is my health orbs?

2564
03:07:14,180 --> 03:07:15,220
Yeah, I guess we go...

2565
03:07:15,220 --> 03:07:17,260
Oh, gotta grab this.

2566
03:07:19,940 --> 03:07:22,280
Grab some money, and then we go through.

2567
03:07:23,160 --> 03:07:25,460
Yeah, only I can bully myself.

2568
03:07:32,960 --> 03:07:34,360
Another empty vault.

2569
03:07:36,020 --> 03:07:36,940
Little brother.

2570
03:07:37,900 --> 03:07:38,760
Perhaps it's time we...

2571
03:07:38,760 --> 03:07:39,660
Don't even say it.

2572
03:07:39,940 --> 03:07:40,840
We're gonna find him.

2573
03:07:41,920 --> 03:07:43,300
Yeah, he's a believer.

2574
03:07:44,040 --> 03:07:45,040
He'll always believe.

2575
03:07:45,800 --> 03:07:46,260
Let's go.

2576
03:07:46,500 --> 03:07:48,300
Oh my god, every door just leads to more doors.

2577
03:07:50,260 --> 03:07:50,800
Please.

2578
03:07:51,660 --> 03:07:51,900
Boy.

2579
03:07:52,000 --> 03:08:09,600
boy sometimes sometimes you have to give up boy up there the
path keeps going oh please boy please is that the same more

2580
03:08:09,600 --> 03:08:20,280
we've seen before a father needs to know when to stop him
this mine is one enormous spiral

2581
03:08:26,540 --> 03:08:29,580
A good father knows when to tell his boy to give up.

2582
03:08:34,360 --> 03:08:36,280
He needs to stop chasing this.

2583
03:08:38,780 --> 03:08:39,760
But what's over here?

2584
03:08:44,980 --> 03:08:45,480
What happened?

2585
03:08:45,900 --> 03:08:46,540
Why didn't that work?

2586
03:08:47,120 --> 03:08:47,920
I don't fucking know.

2587
03:08:48,000 --> 03:08:48,960
You see a giant-ass rock?

2588
03:08:51,080 --> 03:08:52,780
Okay, we'll go down here first.

2589
03:08:56,040 --> 03:08:57,780
Just to see if we're missing anything.

2590
03:08:59,900 --> 03:09:00,760
This is a shortcut?

2591
03:09:09,370 --> 03:09:11,750
Hey, HP.

2592
03:09:12,390 --> 03:09:13,670
That's always good.

2593
03:09:15,050 --> 03:09:16,190
A statue.

2594
03:09:16,770 --> 03:09:17,890
Not just any statue.

2595
03:09:18,530 --> 03:09:22,890
That stony visage hung over the entrance to the world mill
built by Dudine the generous.

2596
03:09:24,250 --> 03:09:25,310
All right, let's in here.

2597
03:09:25,830 --> 03:09:26,470
Knock knock.

2598
03:09:27,330 --> 03:09:27,510
Us.

2599
03:09:28,490 --> 03:09:29,150
Oh no.

2600
03:09:29,670 --> 03:09:30,610
Oh, that's okay.

2601
03:09:31,630 --> 03:09:33,670
I saved it for this occasion.

2602
03:09:36,110 --> 03:09:37,310
No, it's okay.

2603
03:09:37,410 --> 03:09:37,610
It's okay.

2604
03:09:37,650 --> 03:09:38,510
I have HP here.

2605
03:09:39,210 --> 03:09:40,030
I have HP here.

2606
03:09:40,570 --> 03:09:41,850
Oh This is bad.

2607
03:09:42,610 --> 03:09:46,650
This is bad This is so bad.

2608
03:09:47,250 --> 03:09:56,510
I was not expecting another one Oh my god, that's a nice
dodge from my oh God, that's fine.

2609
03:09:56,630 --> 03:09:57,410
It's fine.

2610
03:09:58,490 --> 03:10:07,210
I got shields shields for days Whoa Oh shit.

2611
03:10:07,430 --> 03:10:07,910
Oh, that's okay.

2612
03:10:08,010 --> 03:10:08,630
I got shields.

2613
03:10:09,150 --> 03:10:09,970
Shields for days now.

2614
03:10:12,130 --> 03:10:13,230
Oh my god.

2615
03:10:13,430 --> 03:10:14,530
Are you fucking kidding me?

2616
03:10:14,770 --> 03:10:15,590
All right, there you go.

2617
03:10:15,790 --> 03:10:15,990
Nice.

2618
03:10:16,510 --> 03:10:17,710
All right, it wasn't as bad.

2619
03:10:18,470 --> 03:10:19,170
It's pretty easy.

2620
03:10:19,290 --> 03:10:20,310
Not gonna lie.

2621
03:10:23,720 --> 03:10:26,700
All right, that guy was easier than the last one.

2622
03:10:27,320 --> 03:10:28,100
Holy shit.

2623
03:10:30,160 --> 03:10:31,820
Bro, you got skill diffed.

2624
03:10:32,860 --> 03:10:34,560
That's not what I was ready for.

2625
03:10:35,340 --> 03:10:36,120
Another dead end.

2626
03:10:38,880 --> 03:10:41,900
The knob that feels cold to the top.

2627
03:10:46,520 --> 03:10:47,040
Rest in peace.

2628
03:10:48,780 --> 03:10:51,340
You said you'd follow my lead and I say we keep looking.

2629
03:10:52,180 --> 03:10:53,200
Watch yourself.

2630
03:10:54,600 --> 03:10:55,240
I will follow.

2631
03:10:56,140 --> 03:10:57,420
But I state what I see.

2632
03:10:57,580 --> 03:10:59,560
You do not agree with me.

2633
03:11:00,240 --> 03:11:03,400
But you will not speak to me this way.

2634
03:11:04,620 --> 03:11:05,360
Are we clear?

2635
03:11:07,180 --> 03:11:08,660
That's fucking right, boy.

2636
03:11:10,180 --> 03:11:11,820
Don't make me grab my belt.

2637
03:11:13,020 --> 03:11:15,000
How dare you speak to me like that?

2638
03:11:20,300 --> 03:11:22,880
Alright, let's pull this up.

2639
03:11:23,620 --> 03:11:24,860
Gotta tie it up the rope.

2640
03:11:25,560 --> 03:11:26,400
Ready when you are.

2641
03:11:30,600 --> 03:11:31,500
One more door.

2642
03:11:31,960 --> 03:11:34,880
Yeah, don't make daddy don't be angry.

2643
03:11:34,920 --> 03:11:36,620
Seems like we'll have to get to it first.

2644
03:11:38,380 --> 03:11:39,500
Oh, wait, what?

2645
03:11:40,220 --> 03:11:40,920
Literally that.

2646
03:11:40,980 --> 03:11:41,480
Come on across.

2647
03:11:42,200 --> 03:11:43,940
Look for another way.

2648
03:11:47,200 --> 03:11:48,840
I think I see a crank over here.

2649
03:11:49,400 --> 03:11:50,120
Crank it.

2650
03:11:50,380 --> 03:11:51,500
Crank it, soldier boy.

2651
03:11:52,860 --> 03:11:54,500
Another mental exercise.

2652
03:11:56,040 --> 03:11:58,100
Spends like life fighting, such as tear.

2653
03:11:58,860 --> 03:12:00,700
They have any desire to prove themselves.

2654
03:12:01,480 --> 03:12:04,020
The proof leaves a wake of destruction.

2655
03:12:04,360 --> 03:12:08,340
But if the wake of destruction is a bunch of bad guys, why
does that matter?

2656
03:12:09,320 --> 03:12:11,620
You're strong, and you did the right thing.

2657
03:12:12,100 --> 03:12:13,980
War does not measure the strength of a man.

2658
03:12:14,960 --> 03:12:16,420
I hope one day you understand.

2659
03:12:16,900 --> 03:12:17,960
What is it doing?

2660
03:12:20,440 --> 03:12:22,540
Well, that didn't quite work.

2661
03:12:23,180 --> 03:12:24,200
Something else we can do.

2662
03:12:24,580 --> 03:12:25,380
Oh, no, I'm stuck.

2663
03:12:28,020 --> 03:12:28,880
Oh, no.

2664
03:12:31,000 --> 03:12:31,820
Oh, no.

2665
03:12:31,940 --> 03:12:34,500
Okay, I gotta figure out what to do back here now.

2666
03:12:37,140 --> 03:12:39,180
Oh, it gives me a loop-the-loop.

2667
03:12:39,840 --> 03:12:41,520
What the fuck?

2668
03:12:41,860 --> 03:12:42,100
Okay.

2669
03:12:45,260 --> 03:12:48,480
Okay, it looks like this machine is dropping ore into the
water drop.

2670
03:12:53,000 --> 03:12:53,040
Okay.

2671
03:13:02,240 --> 03:13:03,020
All right, there.

2672
03:13:06,000 --> 03:13:07,880
Yeah, I figured it out.

2673
03:13:09,500 --> 03:13:10,460
I'm so smart.

2674
03:13:15,300 --> 03:13:17,840
Maybe there's a way to get the platform moving again.

2675
03:13:32,300 --> 03:13:32,500
Yay!

2676
03:13:32,900 --> 03:13:33,680
I'm so smart.

2677
03:13:35,500 --> 03:13:37,000
I'm so smart.

2678
03:13:38,420 --> 03:13:39,420
Look at me go.

2679
03:13:40,880 --> 03:13:43,620
You see the one hamster wheel rolling by.

2680
03:13:45,200 --> 03:13:48,600
The one hamster wheel is going over time right now.

2681
03:13:52,780 --> 03:13:53,800
They're out of this way.

2682
03:13:55,080 --> 03:14:00,880
We still have to go back and check out that last door right
yeah yeah yeah we're definitely gonna do that yeah yeah yeah

2683
03:14:00,880 --> 03:14:17,860
for sure we're sure son yeah run little boy run oh whoa what
telegram to be still okay that opens a shortcut I'm pretty

2684
03:14:17,860 --> 03:14:28,880
sure this looks familiar yeah in the spiral section of the
mine yeah we had our we have a dark soul shortcut now all

2685
03:14:28,880 --> 03:14:32,820
right now we go back here i'm pretty sure we're gonna have a
big ass boss fight soon

2686
03:14:37,600 --> 03:14:49,540
stop backseating only my dragons can backseat me because
they paid for it what did you hear that brother yeah i heard

2687
03:14:49,540 --> 03:14:54,220
something we're alone ears open I did hear it.

2688
03:14:54,520 --> 03:14:55,380
I heard someone groaning.

2689
03:14:57,020 --> 03:14:58,360
Yeah, he's taking my job.

2690
03:14:58,600 --> 03:14:59,640
He's taking my job.

2691
03:15:00,200 --> 03:15:01,500
There's a passage leading out.

2692
03:15:02,960 --> 03:15:03,620
All right, let's go.

2693
03:15:11,280 --> 03:15:13,980
Atreus, do my words irritate you?

2694
03:15:14,060 --> 03:15:14,460
It's fine.

2695
03:15:14,780 --> 03:15:15,280
I get it.

2696
03:15:15,380 --> 03:15:15,660
Bravo.

2697
03:15:16,080 --> 03:15:17,580
I told you, he going through puberty.

2698
03:15:18,000 --> 03:15:18,960
That's the worst part.

2699
03:15:22,380 --> 03:15:22,980
Oh.

2700
03:15:24,080 --> 03:15:26,340
Oh, that looked very boss fight-like.

2701
03:15:26,340 --> 03:15:29,600
You don't lock a door like that to secure the spare
bedclothes.

2702
03:15:30,380 --> 03:15:31,760
I see what we must do.

2703
03:15:32,020 --> 03:15:33,460
Oh, that's where a tier is.

2704
03:15:34,300 --> 03:15:34,640
Hmm.

2705
03:15:35,420 --> 03:15:36,120
I don't know.

2706
03:15:36,380 --> 03:15:38,600
This arena looks very boss fighty.

2707
03:15:39,120 --> 03:15:40,520
Atreus, your arrows.

2708
03:15:41,080 --> 03:15:41,780
Ready when you are.

2709
03:15:46,120 --> 03:15:46,640
Alright.

2710
03:15:47,000 --> 03:15:48,320
Three, four.

2711
03:15:50,140 --> 03:15:50,680
Yeah, I know.

2712
03:15:50,740 --> 03:15:51,860
This looks like a boss arena.

2713
03:15:52,900 --> 03:15:53,420
100%.

2714
03:15:53,420 --> 03:15:56,320
I know.

2715
03:15:56,340 --> 03:16:05,500

2716
03:16:09,070 --> 03:16:10,010

2717

boss but it's just regular people okay okay they can oh my

03:16:29,230 --> 03:16:30,910

2719
03:16:31,290 --> 03:16:32,970
Okay, I'm sorry for calling you regular.

2720
03:16:34,490 --> 03:16:36,150
You're very tough, yeah, bro.

2721
03:16:39,810 --> 03:16:40,990
Oh my god.

2722
03:16:41,810 --> 03:16:42,310
Okay, it's fine.

2723
03:16:43,910 --> 03:16:44,990
You're very tough!

2724
03:16:46,690 --> 03:16:47,250
There you go.

2725
03:16:47,710 --> 03:16:48,990
Behind me.

2726
03:16:52,910 --> 03:16:53,410
Okay.

2727
03:16:55,210 --> 03:16:55,710
Nice.

2728
03:16:57,470 --> 03:16:59,170
Nice whenever I can slam dunk.

2729
03:16:59,430 --> 03:16:59,770
You know what?

2730
03:16:59,910 --> 03:17:00,390
Fuck it.

2731
03:17:01,830 --> 03:17:02,390
Oh, shit.

2732
03:17:02,750 --> 03:17:03,310
Don't be mine.

2733
03:17:05,710 --> 03:17:06,330
Boom.

2734
03:17:06,570 --> 03:17:07,970
Slashy, slashy.

2735
03:17:09,230 --> 03:17:10,090
That's right.

2736
03:17:10,570 --> 03:17:11,170
Get burned.

2737
03:17:13,830 --> 03:17:14,450
All right, let's.

2738
03:17:15,550 --> 03:17:16,170
All right.

2739
03:17:16,610 --> 03:17:16,950
All right.

2740
03:17:18,050 --> 03:17:19,590
Get the last arrow, boy.

2741
03:17:20,550 --> 03:17:20,810
Boop.

2742
03:17:22,530 --> 03:17:23,350
Oh, okay.

2743
03:17:23,570 --> 03:17:23,750
Oh, wait.

2744
03:17:24,450 --> 03:17:25,510
Open up tabs.

2745
03:17:27,770 --> 03:17:28,810
Oh, shit.

2746
03:17:29,010 --> 03:17:29,630
Isn't that God?

2747
03:17:29,910 --> 03:17:31,910
The Ritual God of War thing that he did.

2748
03:17:33,990 --> 03:17:34,530
Oh!

2749
03:17:35,610 --> 03:17:37,190
Alright, how big is Tyr?

2750
03:17:37,890 --> 03:17:38,430

2751
03:17:43,860 --> 03:17:44,500
Huh?

2752
03:17:46,060 --> 03:17:46,660

Oh, he's alive!

2754
03:17:51,360 --> 03:17:52,980
He's looking very healthy.

2755
03:17:55,900 --> 03:17:59,000
What trickery is this Odin?

2756
03:18:00,140 --> 03:18:01,180
What game do you play?

2757
03:18:01,180 --> 03:18:02,740
Why didn't he just open it?

2758
03:18:03,200 --> 03:18:03,980
We're not with Odin.

2759
03:18:04,620 --> 03:18:05,240
We're the good guys.

2760
03:18:12,900 --> 03:18:13,460
Oh.

2761
03:18:14,940 --> 03:18:15,860
Oh my god.

2762
03:18:16,120 --> 03:18:17,100
His head is so big.

2763
03:18:24,220 --> 03:18:24,780
Oh.

2764
03:18:34,580 --> 03:18:36,140

03:18:40,340 --> 03:18:42,680

03:18:43,500 --> 03:18:45,140

We need him.

2776
03:19:32,520 --> 03:19:32,780
Wait.

2777
03:19:35,500 --> 03:19:37,880
Holy shit, he just knocked that shit down.

03:19:38,800 --> 03:19:39,220
Oh, no.

2780
03:19:39,840 --> 03:19:41,240
Oh, thank God, it's cutscene.

2781
03:19:41,540 --> 03:19:42,360
Cutscene buff.

2782
03:19:49,320 --> 03:19:50,240
He seems scared.

2783
03:19:50,420 --> 03:19:51,800
Show him my severed head.

2784
03:19:52,240 --> 03:19:52,700
Oh, no.

2785
03:19:53,080 --> 03:19:53,640
Oh, no.

2786
03:19:53,780 --> 03:19:54,540
This is bad.

2787
03:19:56,360 --> 03:19:58,280
No, I don't have my boy!

2788
03:20:10,900 --> 03:20:12,400
He was my aggro!

2789
03:20:16,740 --> 03:20:18,540
Oh my god.

2790
03:20:19,620 --> 03:20:20,180
Alright, nice.

2791
03:20:20,360 --> 03:20:21,740
Got him out of the way.

2792
03:20:22,600 --> 03:20:23,740
Alright, where's the last guy?

2793
03:20:26,640 --> 03:20:27,940
Alright, there we go.

2794
03:20:33,060 --> 03:20:33,960
Alright, nice.

2795
03:20:35,320 --> 03:20:37,860
Not nice though, but lost my aggro.

2796
03:20:43,910 --> 03:20:44,510
Uh...

2797
03:20:44,510 --> 03:20:45,830
I just whack it.

2798
03:20:46,330 --> 03:20:47,390
Oh, I just whack it.

2799
03:20:47,530 --> 03:20:47,750
Okay.

2800
03:20:48,590 --> 03:20:49,230
I don't know.

2801
03:20:49,630 --> 03:20:50,890
Sometimes I can't whack stuff.

2802
03:20:51,890 --> 03:20:56,090
I just wanted to be sure if they are the whack of both
doors.

2803
03:20:59,090 --> 03:20:59,810
Oh, wait, what's...

2804
03:21:01,850 --> 03:21:02,910
Oh, shit.

2805
03:21:05,890 --> 03:21:07,330
Oh, my God.

2806
03:21:07,390 --> 03:21:08,710
Are you fucking kidding me?

2807
03:21:12,250 --> 03:21:14,400
Okay, I'm just gonna swap to the axe now.

2808
03:21:16,030 --> 03:21:18,430
Gotta get your ass out of here.

2809
03:21:20,110 --> 03:21:21,250
Give me your HP.

2810
03:21:22,530 --> 03:21:23,340
One ship is magic!

2811
03:21:26,750 --> 03:21:27,370
Atreya!

2812
03:21:27,590 --> 03:21:28,150
This way!

2813
03:21:28,550 --> 03:21:29,150
Cut him off!

2814
03:21:29,370 --> 03:21:29,710
Jesus!

2815
03:21:31,090 --> 03:21:32,410
Oh my god!

2816
03:21:32,970 --> 03:21:36,230
Oh, oh my god!

2817
03:21:36,610 --> 03:21:37,030

03:21:38,050 --> 03:21:39,390
He's WWEing me!

2819
03:21:43,450 --> 03:21:44,970
Jesus Christ

2820
03:21:48,050 --> 03:21:55,730

That's it.

2825
03:22:21,550 --> 03:22:22,130
Super Ice Power!

2826
03:22:22,470 --> 03:22:23,070
Oh, fuck.

03:22:23,330 --> 03:22:23,830

Never mind.

2831
03:22:28,650 --> 03:22:30,410
The Super Ice Power didn't work.

2832
03:22:36,250 --> 03:22:38,150
All right, it's fine.

2833
03:22:38,490 --> 03:22:41,290

Take your mercy away from Odin.

Show mercy.

2841
03:23:21,970 --> 03:23:22,650
This is my father.

03:23:26,170 --> 03:23:28,090
I don't belong out here, please.

2844
03:23:28,190 --> 03:23:29,570
It's worse when he's angry.

2845
03:23:31,830 --> 03:23:32,690
Mad up!

03:23:37,590 --> 03:23:38,330

There's a statue in the lake.

2855
03:24:28,620 --> 03:24:29,140
You had a spear.

2856
03:24:29,660 --> 03:24:30,520
I thought you needed a weapon.

2857
03:24:30,740 --> 03:24:31,380
Walking stick?

2858
03:24:32,280 --> 03:24:32,520
No.

2859
03:24:34,300 --> 03:24:35,840
The kind thought of it was no.

2860
03:24:37,040 --> 03:24:37,380
Thank you.

2861
03:24:41,880 --> 03:24:42,480
But...

2862
03:24:42,480 --> 03:24:42,960
Okay.

2863
03:24:47,220 --> 03:24:49,080
That's a god of war.

2864
03:24:49,340 --> 03:24:50,040
I, uh...

2865
03:24:52,160 --> 03:24:54,060
I ran because I...

2866
03:24:54,080 --> 03:25:08,600

03:25:08,600 --> 03:25:19,860
six feet everyone hears him talk oh he's crazy crazy we want
some to yeah he's a broken man right now

2868
03:25:26,400 --> 03:25:29,900
i don't think he's definitely the god of pt right now.

2869
03:25:34,300 --> 03:25:35,920
Can you feel that?

2870
03:25:36,680 --> 03:25:37,180
A wind?

2871
03:25:37,880 --> 03:25:38,960
Blowing from over here.

2872
03:25:39,640 --> 03:25:40,640
Maybe there's an exit nearby.

2873
03:25:41,320 --> 03:25:43,560
Are there names by which I should call you?

2874
03:25:43,900 --> 03:25:44,460
I'm Matreus.

2875
03:25:45,160 --> 03:25:45,920
You already know I'm a mirror.

2876
03:25:46,920 --> 03:25:48,280
And that's my father, Kratos.

2877
03:25:48,880 --> 03:25:52,080
How does the son of a Spartan come to speak for the Yodnar?

2878
03:25:52,640 --> 03:25:54,520
My mother was the last giant Midgard.

2879
03:25:55,420 --> 03:25:55,940
Laufei?

2880
03:25:56,520 --> 03:25:57,040
Laufei.

2881
03:25:58,060 --> 03:25:59,440
I remember that name.

2882
03:25:59,720 --> 03:26:01,060
She tried to help people too.

2883
03:26:01,940 --> 03:26:03,460
He's in the light of Alpha now.

2884
03:26:04,400 --> 03:26:05,640
You have my sympathies.

2885
03:26:09,160 --> 03:26:10,640
Gordon, thank you for the super chat.

2886
03:26:10,740 --> 03:26:10,940
Thank you.

2887
03:26:11,020 --> 03:26:11,400
Thank you.

2888
03:26:11,480 --> 03:26:16,080
Look, all I'm saying is if Gwani was here instead of this
guy, this game would be 20 hours shorter.

2889
03:26:18,140 --> 03:26:23,720
I think Gwani might have been fucking dead if he was in this
game.

2890
03:26:26,760 --> 03:26:28,420
Guys, he is.

2891
03:26:29,180 --> 03:26:31,040
Unless you're talking about ascended Gwani.

2892
03:26:31,060 --> 03:26:38,500
when he became the god of war after he died because he was
still a regular guy it was just really tall and buff let me

2893
03:26:38,500 --> 03:26:48,520
get that it's the least i can do god of war now here thank
you the super chat thank you thank you he only ascended to

2894
03:26:48,520 --> 03:27:03,640
become a god of war after his death now he'd win the human
god you can solo thor we thought you'd want to help you

2895
03:27:03,640 --> 03:27:14,820
freed me only to start a war I mean you are a guy of war um
so to you it's good to see you in the flesh again the mere

2896
03:27:14,820 --> 03:27:24,880
what's become of you I was like oh shit execrable torture at
the hands of the old father you didn't deserve such

2897
03:27:24,880 --> 03:27:32,600
treatment you I will say my view was a touch better than
yours we found him the top of a mountain with tree roots

2898
03:27:32,600 --> 03:27:42,500
wrapped all around him the only way to free him was to well
that highly pleasant for all parties involved don't worry

2899
03:27:42,500 --> 03:27:56,000
bemer consented to getting his head chopped off oh it's so
bright oh oh my god flashbang oh my god it's so bright

2900
03:28:01,300 --> 03:28:08,620
I'll kill them to track down a giant in the garden and then
he found Kratos and anyway I've promised to take these two

2901
03:28:08,620 --> 03:28:15,760
to the tallest peak in the realms if they'd chop off my head
and convince Freya to bring it back speak up all there I was

2902
03:28:15,760 --> 03:28:27,900
getting to that it wasn't all kill this kill that hey we're

03:28:37,960 --> 03:28:40,940
And this is your role model!

2905
03:28:44,120 --> 03:28:44,640
Arch!

2906
03:28:45,320 --> 03:28:46,520
Oh my god.

2907
03:28:47,060 --> 03:28:47,760
Arteus!

2908
03:28:48,580 --> 03:28:51,960
We almost died for this man!

2909
03:28:53,500 --> 03:28:55,000

03:30:45,740 --> 03:30:46,880
Is that the tier you need?

2926
03:30:47,660 --> 03:30:49,620
I just take care of a hippie right now.

2927
03:30:49,740 --> 03:30:49,940
That's right.

2928
03:30:50,580 --> 03:30:52,400
He became god of anti-war.

2929
03:30:54,220 --> 03:30:54,820
Forgive me.

2930
03:30:55,480 --> 03:30:57,220

My fight is gone.

2938
03:31:14,080 --> 03:31:16,260
Look, Arteus, he gave me consent to kill him.

2939
03:31:16,820 --> 03:31:17,380
Damage is done.

2940
03:31:17,880 --> 03:31:19,440
No one's killing you, brother.

2941
03:31:20,860 --> 03:31:23,180
Better that than to live to see bread and rock.

2942
03:31:26,220 --> 03:31:27,420
We do not seek war.

2943
03:31:28,380 --> 03:31:28,760
What?

2944
03:31:30,880 --> 03:31:32,260

2952
03:32:45,730 --> 03:32:46,730
We do not know.

2953
03:32:49,050 --> 03:32:51,430
I mean, not all the giants are dead.

2954
03:32:52,590 --> 03:32:53,090
Oh, shit.

2955
03:32:54,350 --> 03:32:54,850
What are those?

2956
03:32:55,550 --> 03:32:56,570
Reinforcements from Asgard.

2957
03:32:57,210 --> 03:33:00,370
The Ayn Haryar will want to investigate my disappearance
thoroughly.

2958
03:33:03,510 --> 03:33:04,390
Oh no.

2959
03:33:04,810 --> 03:33:04,870
Pah!

2960
03:33:05,190 --> 03:33:05,510
Pah!

2961
03:33:05,510 --> 03:33:07,490
Are they using the sky to travel between realms?

2962
03:33:07,830 --> 03:33:08,030
Pah!

2963
03:33:08,430 --> 03:33:10,590
Tricks up his sleeve, we haven't dared to consider.

2964
03:33:11,450 --> 03:33:13,170
They're coming down on neither Galer, too.

2965
03:33:13,790 --> 03:33:14,590
Will the dwarves be okay?

2966
03:33:14,590 --> 03:33:16,770
The time for such concerns has passed.

2967
03:33:17,050 --> 03:33:17,770
We must leave.

2968
03:33:18,290 --> 03:33:20,550
Yeah, we don't even know that we need to care about the joys
right now.

2969
03:33:20,670 --> 03:33:21,830
We gotta care about ourselves.

2970
03:33:22,750 --> 03:33:24,930
I swear to God, fight, fight.

2971
03:33:25,250 --> 03:33:27,590
I swear to God, oh my God, where is he running to?

2972
03:33:27,990 --> 03:33:29,230
Where did he run to?

2973
03:33:29,970 --> 03:33:32,590
Oh my God, I don't even see him.

2974
03:33:33,050 --> 03:33:33,690
Where did he go?

2975
03:33:34,510 --> 03:33:36,090
Oh my God, you little bitch.

2976
03:33:36,810 --> 03:33:36,850
Okay.

2977
03:33:38,610 --> 03:33:39,950
You little bitch.

2978
03:33:40,370 --> 03:33:41,050
You little bitch.

2979
03:33:44,590 --> 03:33:56,170
This is our hero Get up little bro Bro tipped like a sucker

2980
03:34:00,270 --> 03:34:14,410
Okay Once the god of war he dedicated himself to peace All
right, wait then we don't have a god of war anymore How can

2981
03:34:14,410 --> 03:34:17,730
we have a god of peace if we don't have a god of war?

2982
03:34:21,380 --> 03:34:22,940
He's actually a hippie.

2983
03:34:23,820 --> 03:34:27,380
Dear, in your travels, did you ever hear the giants talk
about Loki?

2984
03:34:28,300 --> 03:34:28,720
I'm sorry.

2985
03:34:29,200 --> 03:34:30,460
That name doesn't sound familiar.

2986
03:34:32,180 --> 03:34:33,980
The giants are...

2987
03:34:34,620 --> 03:34:35,140
We're...

2988
03:34:35,140 --> 03:34:36,400
Very private people.

2989
03:34:37,220 --> 03:34:38,080
Oh, that's sad.

2990
03:34:38,900 --> 03:34:39,800
Perhaps after a rest.

2991
03:34:42,660 --> 03:34:43,320
I mean, he's also...

2992
03:34:43,340 --> 03:34:45,740
a giant, so you don't need to use the past tense.

2993
03:34:45,880 --> 03:34:46,700
You're still alive.

2994
03:34:49,980 --> 03:34:51,280
He just wants to chill.

2995
03:34:53,100 --> 03:34:54,880
Next you're gonna tell me he's vegetarian!

2996
03:34:59,490 --> 03:35:02,150
Alright, we got... Oh, Jesus Christ, this is a long-ass
road.

2997
03:35:04,250 --> 03:35:06,230
Oh my god, do we not have a fast track?

2998
03:35:08,910 --> 03:35:10,650
This road is so long.

2999
03:35:12,650 --> 03:35:14,590
A tree house.

3000
03:35:15,230 --> 03:35:17,750
Lord Tyr, you're really alive.

3001
03:35:18,230 --> 03:35:18,590
Am I?

3002
03:35:19,070 --> 03:35:19,490
I wonder.

3003
03:35:20,330 --> 03:35:20,650
Okay.

3004
03:35:20,970 --> 03:35:21,710
He's just tired.

3005
03:35:22,450 --> 03:35:24,530
I promised him some food and a room to rest in.

3006
03:35:24,890 --> 03:35:26,090
Ah, of course you did.

3007
03:35:26,690 --> 03:35:28,150
Well, let's see what we can do.

3008
03:35:28,390 --> 03:35:29,710
Please, come inside.

3009
03:35:30,490 --> 03:35:32,370
Oh, is that considered a loading screen?

3010
03:35:32,570 --> 03:35:33,610
Oh, that's smart.

3011
03:35:35,910 --> 03:35:36,830
Oh, shit.

3012
03:35:36,930 --> 03:35:37,910
Okay, there he is.

3013
03:35:40,330 --> 03:35:40,790
Oh.

3014
03:35:42,350 --> 03:35:43,390
That'll be fast.

3015
03:35:49,000 --> 03:35:50,720
It's like, oh my god, you're real.

3016
03:35:51,760 --> 03:35:52,900
You're actually real.

3017
03:35:55,300 --> 03:35:57,060
I know Jesus is fast.

3018
03:35:57,540 --> 03:35:58,540
I need to go grab...

3019
03:35:58,540 --> 03:36:00,080
Sorry, I need to go use the bathroom real quick.

3020
03:36:00,180 --> 03:36:01,000

Okay.

3036
03:38:12,680 --> 03:38:16,860
Because I don't think I was supposed to be inside.

3037
03:38:17,940 --> 03:38:18,760

3038
03:38:18,760 --> 03:38:19,380

Thank you.

3045
03:38:36,400 --> 03:38:38,220
I think I was supposed to be outside waiting.

3046
03:38:39,100 --> 03:38:40,320
I'm going to turn in.

3047
03:38:40,880 --> 03:38:41,520
Big day tomorrow.

3048
03:38:42,440 --> 03:38:42,980
So, tier.

3049
03:38:44,020 --> 03:38:45,400
Sounds like promises were made.

3050
03:38:46,560 --> 03:38:48,040
Let's see about getting us settled, shall we?

3051
03:38:48,380 --> 03:38:49,580
If you'll follow me.

3052
03:38:49,860 --> 03:38:50,320
Hey!

3053
03:38:50,860 --> 03:38:51,960
Come see what I got.

3054
03:38:52,020 --> 03:38:55,980
I think I was supposed to not go into the house when he went
inside.

3055
03:38:56,240 --> 03:38:57,140
I should have waited out.

3056
03:38:57,300 --> 03:38:57,580
Yeah.

3057
03:38:58,180 --> 03:38:59,460
I was like, what?

3058
03:38:59,740 --> 03:39:00,880
What happened?

3059
03:39:01,880 --> 03:39:02,980
How did I get?

3060
03:39:03,000 --> 03:39:07,580
here okay

3061
03:39:10,860 --> 03:39:16,540
he just wants a broom closet holy shit

3062
03:39:20,060 --> 03:39:27,000
nothing much perhaps some heart attack hard there's no way
this guy used to be the god of war there's no fucking way

3063
03:39:27,000 --> 03:39:35,840
the pinch of salt well I'll see what I can find there is no
way this man used to do anything war related from the

3064
03:39:35,840 --> 03:39:46,080
homeland i'll fix you up reform god award that's what's left
of tear huh back where i come from with satan

3065
03:39:49,180 --> 03:40:01,580
so have we all well ain't you philosophical that man's a
fraud they must be in the pantry kick him out

3066
03:40:05,620 --> 03:40:10,980
boy you could have relied on me but you Yet you picked this
man over here.

3067
03:40:21,020 --> 03:40:23,260
He's just a little washed.

3068
03:40:25,400 --> 03:40:27,420
I am very disappointed.

3069
03:40:28,480 --> 03:40:29,560
They're disappointed.

3070
03:40:30,500 --> 03:40:32,660
I want things to be the way they were.

3071
03:40:34,580 --> 03:40:36,860
Well, I'd like to claim a tree again.

3072
03:40:37,940 --> 03:40:39,280
Certain ships have sailed.

3073
03:40:42,870 --> 03:40:45,210
Yeah, they make anyone a god of war in these lands.

3074
03:40:45,550 --> 03:40:47,390
I just wish Atreus were not so.

3075
03:40:49,770 --> 03:40:50,210
Restless.

3076
03:40:52,110 --> 03:40:53,290
I care only for yourself.

3077
03:40:54,710 --> 03:40:55,490
I know, brother.

3078
03:40:57,330 --> 03:40:59,730
But holding him too tight won't keep him out of danger.

3079
03:41:01,330 --> 03:41:03,370
The lad can't call out this guy forever.

3080
03:41:04,870 --> 03:41:07,510
And I hate to say it, I think Tyr might be one of them.

3081
03:41:08,670 --> 03:41:11,050
I've never seen a man broken so completely.

3082
03:41:12,890 --> 03:41:13,810
His pain is fresh.

3083
03:41:15,290 --> 03:41:16,370
You expect too much.

3084
03:41:17,710 --> 03:41:32,110
oh pretty fair still wants to kill you that's an ally we
could use that is not an option no boy no don't go to her

Moral support.

3091
03:42:22,400 --> 03:42:24,600
Hard to have fucking tear for that.

3092
03:42:28,000 --> 03:42:28,500
Oh, okay.

3093
03:42:28,520 --> 03:42:29,320
I could ruin that.

3094
03:42:30,120 --> 03:42:32,940
Something much less risky, but maybe could give you some
answers.

3095
03:42:33,460 --> 03:42:34,240
What are you talking about?

3096
03:42:34,700 --> 03:42:36,920
A certain old friend you haven't seen in a while.

3097
03:42:37,480 --> 03:42:39,340
A very giant friend.

3098
03:42:39,900 --> 03:42:40,380
Jormungandr?

3099
03:42:41,100 --> 03:42:41,980
Did you find him?

3100
03:42:42,240 --> 03:42:43,100
Why don't I show you?

3101
03:42:43,500 --> 03:42:46,160
It's just on the way to the vengeful goddess who wants you
dead.

3102
03:42:46,160 --> 03:42:49,720
No, she wants my dad dead.

3103
03:42:49,980 --> 03:42:50,900
This is different.

3104
03:42:51,120 --> 03:42:51,900
You know where Freya is.

3105
03:42:52,140 --> 03:42:52,760
No, no.

3106
03:42:53,560 --> 03:42:56,860
I mean, yes, but look, let's just talk to the snake first.

3107
03:42:57,200 --> 03:42:58,520
And then I won't take you to Freya.

3108
03:42:59,360 --> 03:42:59,900
How's that sound?

3109
03:43:01,140 --> 03:43:02,560
I mean, that sounds fine.

3110
03:43:03,480 --> 03:43:05,500
Maybe the big snake would help us.

3111
03:43:06,700 --> 03:43:09,920
Honestly, the big snake is more of a threat than the fucking
tier.

3112
03:43:11,900 --> 03:43:13,900
Alright, now I gotta figure out where to go.

3113
03:43:17,940 --> 03:43:20,140
Glad you brought your key of Igdrasil.

3114
03:43:20,540 --> 03:43:22,480
I seem to have dashed out without mine.

3115
03:43:22,760 --> 03:43:22,840
Huh.

3116
03:43:23,280 --> 03:43:25,320
You got sick of having house guests that fast?

3117
03:43:25,580 --> 03:43:25,680
What?

3118
03:43:26,080 --> 03:43:26,420
No.

3119
03:43:26,840 --> 03:43:29,560
I could just use some fresh air, is all.

3120
03:43:30,020 --> 03:43:31,740
Well, I hope you like it cold.

3121
03:43:32,940 --> 03:43:34,440
Should we swing by your cabin first?

3122
03:43:34,580 --> 03:43:35,860
Oh, no, we're going back.

3123
03:43:36,480 --> 03:43:37,720
Going back to Midguide.

3124
03:43:38,820 --> 03:43:39,300
Oh.

3125
03:43:39,300 --> 03:43:41,120
No, I meant to tell you.

3126
03:43:41,460 --> 03:43:41,860
Oh.

3127
03:43:42,220 --> 03:43:43,000
Enra's dead.

3128
03:43:43,500 --> 03:43:43,980
Oh.

3129
03:43:45,540 --> 03:43:46,140

3130
03:43:46,160 --> 03:43:47,100
Sorry to hear that.

3131
03:43:47,340 --> 03:43:48,460
Wait, what about my two other dogs?

3132
03:43:48,740 --> 03:43:51,580
As wolves go, he was always very clean.

3133
03:43:51,740 --> 03:43:53,340
Wait, we just left our two dogs.

3134
03:43:53,600 --> 03:43:54,240
I just realized.

3135
03:43:54,740 --> 03:43:57,320
But why traumatize either of us further?

3136
03:44:01,360 --> 03:44:02,880
Oh, not been here.

3137
03:44:02,980 --> 03:44:05,220
Caught a whiff of something awful near the Helheim Tower.

3138
03:44:05,860 --> 03:44:06,640
Remember how to get there?

3139
03:44:07,000 --> 03:44:08,360
Yep, just past the oarsman.

3140
03:44:09,200 --> 03:44:11,600
But that's what makes you think your minganders nearby?

3141
03:44:12,020 --> 03:44:13,280

So I have me, like, those little teenagers with, like,
giant-ass like abs and shit i've seen those videos of like

work work out that young that's crazy i'm pretty sure that's

03:46:30,200 --> 03:46:30,280
Wow.

3164
03:46:31,240 --> 03:46:32,740
Almost like you've done this before.

3165
03:46:33,400 --> 03:46:35,540
Looks like there's something hidden by the horsemen.

3166
03:46:35,880 --> 03:46:37,320
If only I had a way to burn this.

3167
03:46:37,580 --> 03:46:37,920

Oh my god.

3170
03:46:40,840 --> 03:46:44,000
All of these things are, like, things that only my dad can
do.

3171
03:46:45,040 --> 03:46:46,240
Yeah, I'm not sure.

3172
03:46:46,760 --> 03:46:47,660
Don't look at me.

3173
03:46:48,380 --> 03:46:49,320
Who knows where it's been?

have, like, to try to, like, show abs, They're like super-

you have to be like super dehydrated or some shit to have
abs.

He does not, he's a sheep.

3209
03:48:45,360 --> 03:48:47,000

03:53:19,170 --> 03:53:20,430
It's very cold.

3242
03:53:20,850 --> 03:53:21,510
Good talk.

3243
03:53:24,070 --> 03:53:24,630
Ironwood.

Oh, he doesn't fucking translate.

3246
03:53:30,270 --> 03:53:30,830
Means he should have stayed home.

3247
03:53:33,690 --> 03:53:34,630
Let's head back.

3248
03:53:45,320 --> 03:53:47,060
It's barely a translation.

3249
03:53:47,320 --> 03:53:48,700
All I got was ironwood.

3250
03:53:55,190 --> 03:53:57,810
But the door opened.

3251
03:53:58,310 --> 03:53:58,850
Oh, no.

3252
03:54:01,390 --> 03:54:03,090
Oh, we did not think this through.

3253
03:54:06,470 --> 03:54:08,650
Oh, I'm gonna break my fucking bow.

3254
03:54:09,810 --> 03:54:11,150
Would you just let me do it?

3255
03:54:12,490 --> 03:54:12,870
Maybe.

3256
03:54:17,410 --> 03:54:19,090
Okay, you do it, then.

3257
03:54:19,290 --> 03:54:20,290
You're so strong.

3258
03:54:21,290 --> 03:54:22,030
That's right.

3259
03:54:22,110 --> 03:54:23,310
What you gonna do?

3260
03:54:26,610 --> 03:54:26,970
Yeah.

3261
03:54:28,450 --> 03:54:32,910
Well, now that I know where she is, yeah, exactly what I'm
gonna do.

3262
03:54:37,250 --> 03:54:37,330
What?

3263
03:54:38,450 --> 03:54:39,970
Don't tell Brock I cursed.

3264
03:54:40,870 --> 03:54:42,150
He's unbearable when he's smart.

3265
03:54:42,230 --> 03:54:43,190
Wait, what the fuck?

3266
03:54:44,850 --> 03:54:45,870
What the...

3267
03:54:45,870 --> 03:54:46,210
What?

3268
03:54:47,710 --> 03:54:49,790
How did that work?

3269
03:54:50,390 --> 03:54:51,510
Baldur tried to kill her.

3270
03:54:52,130 --> 03:54:53,310
We had no choice.

3271
03:54:53,690 --> 03:54:55,590
Not sure she sees it that way.

3272
03:54:55,910 --> 03:54:57,370
Well, I'm not going to ask her.

3273
03:54:58,030 --> 03:54:58,650
The door opened.

3274
03:54:59,770 --> 03:55:00,690
You're absolutely right.

3275
03:55:01,110 --> 03:55:03,750
Which is exactly why I'm recommending you don't do this.

3276
03:55:04,110 --> 03:55:05,950
But I'm magic too!

3277
03:55:08,350 --> 03:55:11,770
Why did his magic work and mine didn't?

3278
03:55:12,910 --> 03:55:14,750
I'm literally magic.

3279
03:55:17,230 --> 03:55:18,370
Let's watch things.

3280
03:55:23,690 --> 03:55:24,810
Alright, that's fine.

3281
03:55:27,890 --> 03:55:29,950
I can bash him with my thing.

3282
03:55:36,250 --> 03:55:37,250
Alright, nice.

3283
03:55:38,590 --> 03:55:40,870
It's gonna be so fun when more enemies show up.

3284
03:55:42,010 --> 03:55:43,290
Because, like, two is fine.

3285
03:55:43,450 --> 03:55:44,150
Two is okay.

3286
03:55:44,290 --> 03:55:46,890
But when it starts being, like, three, I don't know.

3287
03:55:53,670 --> 03:55:56,230
It might start getting harder.

3288
03:55:56,770 --> 03:55:56,850
Oh,

3289
03:56:00,490 --> 03:56:00,670
wait.

3290
03:56:02,190 --> 03:56:02,690
Nice.

3291
03:56:05,050 --> 03:56:06,990
Alright, there you go.

3292
03:56:08,230 --> 03:56:08,650
Box to key.

3293
03:56:10,550 --> 03:56:12,750
Well, that's quite an excitement for one day.

3294
03:56:13,090 --> 03:56:13,290
Yeah!

3295
03:56:13,810 --> 03:56:14,790
We're so close.

3296
03:56:16,750 --> 03:56:18,570
Oh, dear.

3297
03:56:20,050 --> 03:56:20,530
What?

3298
03:56:21,630 --> 03:56:22,510
Why are you all deering?

3299
03:56:23,350 --> 03:56:23,670
What's wrong?

3300
03:56:23,870 --> 03:56:24,390
This is a sign.

3301
03:56:25,510 --> 03:56:26,230
Don't be a baby.

3302
03:56:27,330 --> 03:56:27,990
It's snow.

3303
03:56:28,230 --> 03:56:28,950
Not to drop you this time.

3304
03:56:30,890 --> 03:56:31,210
Yeah.

3305
03:56:32,770 --> 03:56:33,250
Yay.

3306
03:56:33,990 --> 03:56:35,170
Just step between the realms then.

3307
03:56:35,690 --> 03:56:37,210
You know it doesn't work that way.

3308
03:56:37,670 --> 03:56:39,490
Though sweet vessel, I wish it did.

3309
03:56:40,490 --> 03:56:41,910
I jump into my arms.

3310
03:56:42,250 --> 03:56:42,450
Ah!

3311
03:56:42,630 --> 03:56:43,430
Been so scary!

3312
03:56:44,370 --> 03:56:46,430
I sincerely hope I never have to do it again.

3313
03:56:48,590 --> 03:56:49,450
Look at that!

3314
03:56:50,750 --> 03:56:51,670
That easy.

3315
03:56:53,410 --> 03:56:56,530
Well, if I can't stop you, then this is as far as I go.

3316
03:56:57,090 --> 03:56:57,090
What?

3317
03:56:57,430 --> 03:56:59,570
I'm gonna stay and fix this.

3318
03:57:00,010 --> 03:57:00,750
Suit yourself.

3319
03:57:00,870 --> 03:57:02,050
Wait, what do you mean?

3320
03:57:03,510 --> 03:57:05,950
Who's gonna be my throwy man?

3321
03:57:07,270 --> 03:57:08,690
Oh my god, I got new skills.

3322
03:57:08,870 --> 03:57:10,250
Okay, we gotta upgrade this shit.

3323
03:57:11,890 --> 03:57:12,770
Okay, wait.

3324
03:57:14,010 --> 03:57:17,210
Yeah, we need... Oh my god, that's the only thing I can
upgrade.

3325
03:57:17,230 --> 03:57:17,970
Great, okay.

3326
03:57:18,490 --> 03:57:19,210
Oh, I can upgrade more.

3327
03:57:19,330 --> 03:57:19,810
That's good.

3328
03:57:21,390 --> 03:57:22,190
Sonic Arrows.

3329
03:57:29,410 --> 03:57:30,670
Okay, yeah, we'll do that.

3330
03:57:36,680 --> 03:57:37,320
Oh, my God.

3331
03:57:37,420 --> 03:57:38,460
Now it's just me.

3332
03:57:38,760 --> 03:57:39,980
Okay, this is not good.

3333
03:57:40,360 --> 03:57:41,640
I don't think I can break this.

3334
03:57:42,040 --> 03:57:43,380
I need to find another way around.

3335
03:57:43,560 --> 03:57:44,280
This is not good.

3336
03:57:44,380 --> 03:57:46,500
I didn't think it was a one-man mission.

3337
03:57:47,460 --> 03:57:48,900
I lied it under my shirt.

3338
03:57:49,380 --> 03:57:51,660
And besides, it's a reminder to be better.

3339
03:57:52,180 --> 03:57:54,080
You need a murder weapon to be a better person.

3340
03:57:54,100 --> 03:57:56,100
It makes me feel brave, okay?

3341
03:57:56,660 --> 03:57:57,800
Is that such a bad thing?

3342
03:57:58,040 --> 03:58:02,280
When it leads you to believe you can convince Freya of
anything, yes, it is.

3343
03:58:02,440 --> 03:58:04,060
I mean, a murder weapon.

3344
03:58:05,080 --> 03:58:05,920
It's good for...

3345
03:58:05,920 --> 03:58:08,640
I mean, it makes me feel like I'm invincible.

3346
03:58:09,240 --> 03:58:11,420
Oh my god, who the fuck threw that?

3347
03:58:12,500 --> 03:58:13,880
Oh my god.

3348
03:58:14,240 --> 03:58:14,720
Alright, it's fine.

3349
03:58:15,220 --> 03:58:15,860
Oh, it's fine.

3350
03:58:18,340 --> 03:58:19,720
Now it's fine.

3351
03:58:22,380 --> 03:58:23,800
Yeah, it's good for myself.

3352
03:58:24,100 --> 03:58:24,340
I see.

3353
03:58:24,740 --> 03:58:26,620
Rock says some people run better on chaos.

3354
03:58:27,460 --> 03:58:28,320
I think he's right.

3355
03:58:28,760 --> 03:58:30,700
What makes you think that a player here?

3356
03:58:30,700 --> 03:58:32,760
Ooh, use his brother against him.

3357
03:58:33,620 --> 03:58:35,820
We can't just do nothing and we're out of options.

3358
03:58:37,120 --> 03:58:38,160
Living is an option.

3359
03:58:40,660 --> 03:58:43,400
Yeah, but that's not...

3360
03:58:43,400 --> 03:58:44,800
But don't you like the risk?

3361
03:58:48,200 --> 03:58:49,920
Potential of maybe dying.

3362
03:58:50,480 --> 03:58:51,580
As long as I go up and forward.

3363
03:58:51,700 --> 03:58:52,600
We're doing what we love.

3364
03:58:54,340 --> 03:59:01,980
Yeah, that's why we have extreme sports Yeah, with the fuck
it, we ball

3365
03:59:11,340 --> 03:59:19,500
Fucking you, I knew you weren't real I knew you weren't real
That's right, what you're gonna do now Oh, he doesn't know

3366
03:59:19,500 --> 03:59:24,720
what Oh, shit, oh shit, what the fuck How did you get here?

3367
03:59:24,880 --> 03:59:28,820
I was like, how was you good?

3368
03:59:29,780 --> 03:59:31,380
way to get up here?

3369
03:59:33,500 --> 03:59:36,100
Okay, I did not know there was a way to get up here, guys.

3370
03:59:42,460 --> 03:59:43,160
Oh my god.

3371
03:59:43,360 --> 03:59:43,740
Don't worry.

3372
03:59:46,080 --> 03:59:46,800
See, look at that.

3373
03:59:46,840 --> 03:59:48,140
We're all chilling right now.

3374
03:59:50,240 --> 03:59:51,660
they can't even reach me.

3375
03:59:51,980 --> 03:59:53,520
And this guy's stuck.

3376
03:59:56,080 --> 03:59:56,100
Yeah.

3377
03:59:56,600 --> 03:59:57,300
What the fuck?

3378
03:59:57,440 --> 03:59:58,240
He's still alive?

3379
04:00:00,280 --> 04:00:00,720
Alright.

3380
04:00:02,900 --> 04:00:03,360
Alright.

3381
04:00:03,360 --> 04:00:03,620
Okay.

3382
04:00:04,760 --> 04:00:06,100
Okay, just to be sure.

3383
04:00:10,240 --> 04:00:12,700
Okay, just leave no survivors, you know?

3384
04:00:16,880 --> 04:00:17,360
Alright.

3385
04:00:18,080 --> 04:00:18,920
More soundstone.

3386
04:00:22,430 --> 04:00:23,850
There has to be a...

3387
04:00:26,430 --> 04:00:26,750
Oh.

3388
04:00:27,390 --> 04:00:28,810
I guess there isn't.

3389
04:00:29,050 --> 04:00:31,650
I was like, there has to be something for me to shoot at.

3390
04:00:31,750 --> 04:00:32,330
It's blocked.

3391
04:00:32,910 --> 04:00:34,510
Needed to destroy the Sonic piece first.

3392
04:00:35,910 --> 04:00:48,470
Okay All right, I just need to get a different angle on the
soundstone Easy oh shit Get out of here.

3393
04:00:48,730 --> 04:00:49,410
That's fucking right.

3394
04:00:49,790 --> 04:00:50,350
Oh, okay.

3395
04:00:50,550 --> 04:00:53,970
That was sick That was actually sick

3396
04:01:03,610 --> 04:01:05,410
That's called strategy

3397
04:01:09,950 --> 04:01:13,350
Played a lot and live the king Okay, nice.

3398
04:01:13,870 --> 04:01:15,570
More crafting materials.

3399
04:01:16,390 --> 04:01:17,490
Or that is just bonus.

3400
04:01:17,650 --> 04:01:19,070
And what the fuck do I go?

3401
04:01:20,390 --> 04:01:21,590
That's just loot.

3402
04:01:30,530 --> 04:01:31,010
What?

3403
04:01:36,120 --> 04:01:37,900
Really, all that got was loot?

3404
04:01:38,440 --> 04:01:38,700
Man.

3405
04:01:39,640 --> 04:01:40,720
My father could see me now.

3406
04:01:40,760 --> 04:01:41,240
Oh, here.

3407
04:01:43,300 --> 04:01:45,300
It's the whole...

3408
04:01:45,300 --> 04:01:47,480
I wouldn't have to hide things if he just trust me.

3409
04:01:48,040 --> 04:01:49,220

04:02:18,490 --> 04:02:20,790
What the fuck did I do?

3414
04:02:22,650 --> 04:02:23,690
What is that?

3415
04:02:32,470 --> 04:02:33,510
Oh, okay.

3416
04:02:39,060 --> 04:02:39,940
Alright, that's fine.

3417
04:02:41,300 --> 04:02:42,340
Are you fucking kidding me?

3418
04:02:42,460 --> 04:02:43,060
Okay, that's fine.

3419
04:02:45,000 --> 04:02:46,280
Oh, is that a shield?

3420
04:02:49,680 --> 04:02:50,240
Okay.

3421
04:02:52,680 --> 04:02:54,180
Are you fucking kidding me?

3422
04:02:54,460 --> 04:02:54,460
Okay.

3423
04:02:57,600 --> 04:02:59,200
Okay, that was a lot stronger.

3424
04:03:04,350 --> 04:03:07,090
All right, let's just slowly kill these guys.

3425
04:03:10,650 --> 04:03:11,770
There you go.

3426
04:03:12,210 --> 04:03:12,210
Oh!

3427
04:03:13,010 --> 04:03:13,810
That's sick.

3428
04:03:14,750 --> 04:03:15,750
I parried it.

3429
04:03:15,890 --> 04:03:16,070
Yeah.

3430
04:03:18,310 --> 04:03:20,610
Yeah, but then there was like the R1 and the M2.

3431
04:03:20,630 --> 04:03:22,690
The L1 are one shit.

3432
04:03:22,810 --> 04:03:23,470
And I was like, what?

3433
04:03:25,810 --> 04:03:27,150
Oh, he fell down.

3434
04:03:28,330 --> 04:03:30,210
Oh my god, I couldn't just done that.

3435
04:03:34,070 --> 04:03:36,690
Yeah, but like, how come... What was the... Oh, this.

3436
04:03:36,990 --> 04:03:37,890
I don't choose Truster.

3437
04:03:38,790 --> 04:03:39,970
I want you to... Oh, the cooldown.

3438
04:03:40,230 --> 04:03:41,010
I just saw the cooldown.

3439
04:03:41,830 --> 04:03:42,890
I noticed it.

3440
04:03:47,880 --> 04:03:51,000
It was because I didn't... I didn't realize there was a
cooldown for that.

3441
04:03:51,480 --> 04:03:53,240
I was like, what the fuck is the move?

3442
04:03:54,160 --> 04:03:56,720
I did it, but then it didn't show up again.

3443
04:04:02,270 --> 04:04:04,190
Which because you didn't have the...

3444
04:04:04,710 --> 04:04:04,910
Oh.

3445
04:04:12,150 --> 04:04:15,550
Arteus, why did you never do the shielding thing when you
fight with your dad?

3446
04:04:16,390 --> 04:04:16,790
Arteus.

3447
04:04:17,590 --> 04:04:18,330
Oh, oh dear!

3448
04:04:20,710 --> 04:04:21,110
Oh.

3449
04:04:21,510 --> 04:04:22,150
Wait, what the fuck?

3450
04:04:22,290 --> 04:04:23,330
Wait, where the fuck did the...

3451
04:04:23,330 --> 04:04:23,950
Wait, what the fuck?

3452
04:04:23,990 --> 04:04:25,170
Where the fuck did the deer come from?

3453
04:04:25,190 --> 04:04:40,950
from wait a minute how did a deer get up here did it climb
up here there's no way i didn't oh shit oh i'm saying i

3454
04:04:40,950 --> 04:04:43,260

3455
04:04:50,830 --> 04:04:58,070
oh what the wait the deer's dead now i just saw the deer

3456
04:05:03,870 --> 04:05:05,610
I literally just saw him.

3457
04:05:11,850 --> 04:05:12,370
Alright.

3458
04:05:15,970 --> 04:05:17,270
It was a deer.

3459
04:05:18,230 --> 04:05:21,150
Yeah, I was like, bro, what happened to him?

3460
04:05:24,090 --> 04:05:25,390
Guess I'm going the right way.

3461
04:05:25,850 --> 04:05:27,750
Oh my god, it's all the way down there.

3462
04:05:34,520 --> 04:05:35,720
Get out of here.

3463
04:05:37,920 --> 04:05:41,220
I feel like my melee attacks are stronger than my goddamn
bowie.

3464
04:05:41,240 --> 04:05:59,610
arrow which does not make sense to me I should have enough
right to upgrade my stuff no all I've been doing is shooting

3465
04:05:59,610 --> 04:06:17,950
okay which one is not real or which one is real oh I don't
trust you guys might come back alive Oh, it's you.

3466
04:06:19,170 --> 04:06:20,390
I fucking knew it.

3467
04:06:21,070 --> 04:06:21,870
I can tell.

3468
04:06:22,990 --> 04:06:24,570
Oh, my God.

3469
04:06:25,330 --> 04:06:26,670
That's fucking rent.

3470
04:06:30,590 --> 04:06:31,310
Are you fucking...

3471
04:06:31,310 --> 04:06:31,900
Okay, it's fine.

3472
04:06:34,190 --> 04:06:34,670
There you go.

3473
04:06:36,010 --> 04:06:37,250
There you go.

3474
04:06:38,730 --> 04:06:39,930
I'm just gonna maintain it.

3475
04:06:40,150 --> 04:06:40,290
Oh.

3476
04:06:41,010 --> 04:06:41,890
Oh, fuck.

3477
04:06:42,310 --> 04:06:42,990
Oh, fuck.

3478
04:06:44,250 --> 04:06:45,430
What the fuck?

3479
04:06:47,630 --> 04:06:50,390
Okay, the aim assist actually fucked me over there.

3480
04:06:52,710 --> 04:06:56,090
I don't know if you saw that, but my aim assist kept
dragging up.

3481
04:06:56,630 --> 04:07:00,190
It was dragging me up to, like, him instead of the...

3482
04:07:02,130 --> 04:07:03,890
Instead of the actual target.

3483
04:07:06,810 --> 04:07:07,270
There you go.

3484
04:07:07,370 --> 04:07:09,150
Okay, that was sick, though, Arteus.

3485
04:07:15,890 --> 04:07:17,590
Oh, I could charge up this?

3486
04:07:21,130 --> 04:07:36,830
wait what I didn't know I could charge up this fuck this I'm
putting shooting this guy I can go up to him get over here

3487
04:07:36,830 --> 04:07:50,970
get over here nice oh you're still alive he was still alive
oh there has to be a jar here

3488
04:07:55,630 --> 04:08:00,250
Oh, there it is.

3489
04:08:01,190 --> 04:08:01,590
Fire jar.

3490
04:08:05,760 --> 04:08:11,300
I will say Arteus is more fun to play because it's like
shooting a gun.

3491
04:08:15,040 --> 04:08:21,540
I enjoy his mechanic more because it feels like I'm just
playing an FPS game.

3492
04:08:23,720 --> 04:08:24,320
Oh, what?

3493
04:08:24,520 --> 04:08:25,740
I got this, right?

3494
04:08:26,460 --> 04:08:27,020
Yeah, I do.

3495
04:08:27,320 --> 04:08:27,820
I got this.

3496
04:08:29,600 --> 04:08:30,320
Oh, never mind.

3497
04:08:31,700 --> 04:08:32,520
Oh, I shoot your feet.

3498
04:08:32,880 --> 04:08:33,300
Oh, shit.

3499
04:08:33,580 --> 04:08:34,080
Oh, shit!

3500
04:08:36,340 --> 04:08:36,940
That's right.

3501
04:08:37,280 --> 04:08:38,140
Got your foots.

3502
04:08:38,580 --> 04:08:39,820
Got your featsies.

3503
04:08:41,500 --> 04:08:43,000
Got blocked forever.

3504
04:08:43,800 --> 04:08:45,220
Freya shouldn't be much farther now.

3505
04:08:45,860 --> 04:08:47,360
Just need to look out for that big door.

3506
04:08:49,320 --> 04:08:50,620
Alright, I'll grab this too.

3507
04:08:52,540 --> 04:08:54,020
Dirty Hanzo player.

3508
04:08:56,460 --> 04:08:59,360
I'm not even using mouse and keyboard, too, guys.

3509
04:08:59,920 --> 04:09:00,500
Look at that.

3510
04:09:01,400 --> 04:09:02,060
Character development.

3511
04:09:02,940 --> 04:09:05,280
I'm getting better at controller now.

3512
04:09:10,880 --> 04:09:12,620
That's real character development.

3513
04:09:13,260 --> 04:09:13,560
Oh, hey.

3514
04:09:14,600 --> 04:09:14,940
Yeah?

3515
04:09:15,060 --> 04:09:15,240
Yep.

3516
04:09:15,820 --> 04:09:16,400
That's the door.

3517
04:09:20,430 --> 04:09:21,570
Hello, down there.

3518
04:09:21,730 --> 04:09:22,110
Hey.

3519
04:09:22,790 --> 04:09:24,010
Come to your senses yet?

3520
04:09:24,250 --> 04:09:24,550
Yes.

3521
04:09:24,930 --> 04:09:27,210
I mean, I'm not changing my mind.

3522
04:09:27,270 --> 04:09:28,190
Oh, shit.

3523
04:09:28,690 --> 04:09:29,830
You do have doubts.

3524
04:09:32,570 --> 04:09:33,610
That's right.

3525
04:09:34,770 --> 04:09:35,670
You never do.

3526
04:09:36,570 --> 04:09:37,550
Better than having regrets.

3527
04:09:37,890 --> 04:09:39,270
I'm not sure I agree with that.

3528
04:09:39,690 --> 04:09:43,330
But by all means, keep going and you might find those too.

3529
04:09:45,730 --> 04:09:47,990
Just like you little shit.

3530
04:09:48,690 --> 04:09:50,930
I'm sure that fucking came over here.

3531
04:09:53,590 --> 04:09:55,290
I was just like, boys will be boys.

3532
04:09:55,790 --> 04:09:56,530
I'm going through puberty.

3533
04:09:57,110 --> 04:09:57,890
Hey, Freya.

3534
04:09:58,510 --> 04:09:58,830
What?

3535
04:09:59,130 --> 04:10:00,450
Can't I pay an old friend a visit?

3536
04:10:01,270 --> 04:10:02,890
Nothing wrong with that, right?

3537
04:10:03,830 --> 04:10:07,130
I mean, just because I'm responsible for the death of your
son doesn't mean...

3538
04:10:07,130 --> 04:10:08,130
I can meet your new son.

3539
04:10:08,410 --> 04:10:08,790
Okay, yeah.

3540
04:10:09,050 --> 04:10:10,190
You can restart with me.

3541
04:10:11,930 --> 04:10:12,570
Is that for you?

3542
04:10:13,070 --> 04:10:14,250
Am I wearing this around my neck?

3543
04:10:15,370 --> 04:10:16,810
The arrow tip that killed your son.

3544
04:10:17,050 --> 04:10:17,450
Jesus.

3545
04:10:17,850 --> 04:10:18,950
That's a great question.

3546
04:10:21,370 --> 04:10:22,490
I'm so dead.

3547
04:10:22,890 --> 04:10:24,830
I'll be like, for you, don't you have...

3548
04:10:24,830 --> 04:10:25,950
You want a new son, right?

3549
04:10:26,050 --> 04:10:26,950
We can restart.

3550
04:10:27,130 --> 04:10:27,750
You and I.

3551
04:10:28,250 --> 04:10:29,190
Here goes nothing.

3552
04:10:29,910 --> 04:10:30,570
It's not weird.

3553
04:10:30,830 --> 04:10:32,950
And I know magic.

3554
04:10:33,350 --> 04:10:34,650
And I can feel pain.

3555
04:10:41,210 --> 04:10:44,070
It's the best of both worlds.

3556
04:10:51,120 --> 04:10:52,660
And I'm not completely insane.

3557
04:10:53,620 --> 04:10:55,100
You should have stayed with Sindri.

3558
04:10:56,740 --> 04:10:56,980
What?

3559
04:10:57,020 --> 04:10:58,140
Isn't that what Boulder is?

3560
04:10:58,520 --> 04:10:59,700
Like she gave him?

3561
04:11:00,340 --> 04:11:00,720
Um.

3562
04:11:00,920 --> 04:11:03,420
He made it so that he could never suffer pain.

3563
04:11:03,760 --> 04:11:04,300
Feel pain.

3564
04:11:04,620 --> 04:11:05,260
You sent you?

3565
04:11:06,340 --> 04:11:06,700
No!

3566
04:11:07,500 --> 04:11:08,860
He doesn't know.

3567
04:11:10,300 --> 04:11:11,440
And I'm not evil.

3568
04:11:12,440 --> 04:11:13,160
You shouldn't have come.

3569
04:11:14,260 --> 04:11:15,200
He took my son.

3570
04:11:15,840 --> 04:11:17,960
What makes you think I won't do the same?

3571
04:11:22,160 --> 04:11:23,420
You're better than this.

3572
04:11:31,560 --> 04:11:32,100
Oh.

3573
04:11:35,740 --> 04:11:37,340
Oh, she's been crying.

3574
04:11:40,020 --> 04:11:53,410
look I brought you the arrow that killed your son out of
goodwill would stake your life on it what do you know of me

3575
04:11:53,410 --> 04:11:59,670
I know you haven't killed me yet so while you're thinking it
over why don't you let me go and I could tell you why it

3576
04:11:59,670 --> 04:12:14,610
came if you mean to plead for your father save your breath
his fate is sealed but you know get to Odin nor do I need to

3577
04:12:14,610 --> 04:12:24,970
he's like I can't kill Odin so I'll kill the second best
thing that's crazy that he came to Midgard he came to us

3578
04:12:24,970 --> 04:12:39,170
offered peace if we don't move against him claims Ragnarok's
already been averted he lies maybe but if you know girl's

3579
04:12:39,170 --> 04:12:46,490
prophecies you know it depends on an army of giants but
there's no giant giants wait for war in Jotunheim they're

3580
04:12:46,490 --> 04:13:01,330
all dead I've been there there is no giant army there are no
giants at all just me huh you in

3581
04:13:04,900 --> 04:13:14,460
Jotunheim you learn the truth my mother was the last
guardian of our people in Midgard and and that's not all the

3582
04:13:14,460 --> 04:13:25,900
Giants have prophecies about me they know me as pro those
are crazy eyes okay never fuck crazy bro holy shit I think

3583
04:13:25,900 --> 04:13:37,240
maybe stare of a thousand miles help stop Odin somehow but
since all the Giants are dead and you won't fight Odin and

3584
04:13:37,240 --> 04:13:56,240
he's already won why are we working together now that you
can fight again I am far from whole okay okay but we found

3585
04:13:56,240 --> 04:14:10,280
here maybe if you spoke to him here is alive yeah yeah we we
broke him out a little bitch but yeah impossible the nine

3586
04:14:10,280 --> 04:14:21,360
realms are closed to all no we opened up the way we just
don't know where to go next but if we all band together

3587
04:14:21,360 --> 04:14:28,420
enough enough oh leave

3588
04:14:34,010 --> 04:14:45,130
this place go and do not return what go before I change my
mind I'm like so high do not expect the same mercy for your

3589
04:14:51,090 --> 04:14:52,770
But what the fuck?

3590
04:14:55,050 --> 04:14:56,470
I'm trying to put a team.

3591
04:14:58,870 --> 04:15:00,150
The Norse Avengers.

3592
04:15:01,410 --> 04:15:05,670
I mean the Avengers practically like, I mean Thor was
already in it so.

3593
04:15:07,350 --> 04:15:10,910
What if we made the Avengers but they're all just Norse
gods?

3594
04:15:13,130 --> 04:15:14,870
I know she's so Sundae.

3595
04:15:18,610 --> 04:15:21,110
Like, she didn't kill us, so that's progress, honestly.

3596
04:15:21,370 --> 04:15:21,690
You're right.

3597
04:15:23,530 --> 04:15:28,390
Like, she didn't kill us, so, like, we can get in.

3598
04:15:29,290 --> 04:15:31,550
She just needs a bit of time to think over it, you know?

3599
04:15:32,150 --> 04:15:33,730
She needs some time, guys.

3600
04:15:34,970 --> 04:15:36,070
I think we're in.

3601
04:15:36,510 --> 04:15:38,310
I think she wants to join my team.

3602
04:15:42,630 --> 04:15:44,210
Yeah, baby steps, guys.

3603
04:15:44,390 --> 04:15:45,050
Baby steps.

3604
04:15:45,070 --> 04:15:45,690
So I'm not dead.

3605
04:15:46,170 --> 04:15:47,430
But I didn't get any answers.

3606
04:15:47,830 --> 04:15:50,190
So this all might have just been the guardian of it.

3607
04:15:50,270 --> 04:15:50,710
injuries.

3608
04:15:58,230 --> 04:16:01,070
All right, up we go.

3609
04:16:04,250 --> 04:16:05,630
Down we go.

3610
04:16:05,730 --> 04:16:07,170
It's a good thing I like climbing.

3611
04:16:10,170 --> 04:16:10,310
Okay.

3612
04:16:12,890 --> 04:16:14,050
All right, we go this way.

3613
04:16:16,110 --> 04:16:17,170
Oh nice, look.

3614
04:16:20,050 --> 04:16:21,890
Oh, hey.

3615
04:16:23,210 --> 04:16:24,130
I made it.

3616
04:16:24,630 --> 04:16:24,870
What?

3617
04:16:25,410 --> 04:16:33,670
I talked to her on, um, yeah, bad news about that.

3618
04:16:34,510 --> 04:16:36,170
Uh, where's your necklace?

3619
04:16:36,650 --> 04:16:36,770
Huh?

3620
04:16:37,450 --> 04:16:42,350
Oh, I was thinking and I, uh, got rid of it.

3621
04:16:42,570 --> 04:16:44,010
She took it, didn't she?

3622
04:16:44,570 --> 04:16:46,570
Uh, today was your lucky day.

3623
04:16:47,230 --> 04:16:50,250
So tell me, how did it feel to run on cash?

3624
04:16:50,270 --> 04:16:50,730
chaos.

3625
04:16:52,170 --> 04:16:52,610
I...

3626
04:16:52,610 --> 04:16:52,930
Oh!

3627
04:16:56,170 --> 04:16:57,070
Oh, shit.

3628
04:16:57,430 --> 04:16:58,830
Don't worry, she'll come to fix...

3629
04:16:58,830 --> 04:16:59,470
Oh, she did.

3630
04:16:59,550 --> 04:16:59,970
She did.

3631
04:17:00,010 --> 04:17:01,090
I was gonna say...

3632
04:17:01,090 --> 04:17:03,270
I'll be like, Freya's just gonna show up right here, right?

3633
04:17:04,230 --> 04:17:06,130
She did not show up, guys.

3634
04:17:07,750 --> 04:17:08,090
Oh.

3635
04:17:11,090 --> 04:17:11,990
Oh, whoops.

3636
04:17:12,610 --> 04:17:13,250
Oh, fuck it.

3637
04:17:13,510 --> 04:17:14,690
Just slam dunk it.

3638
04:17:20,730 --> 04:17:21,470
Oh, shit.

3639
04:17:21,570 --> 04:17:21,830
Okay.

3640
04:17:22,210 --> 04:17:22,790
That's easy.

3641
04:17:24,150 --> 04:17:25,870
And that guy wasn't even that high.

3642
04:17:26,270 --> 04:17:27,250
Oh my god, there's more.

3643
04:17:29,070 --> 04:17:30,610
There was more people.

3644
04:17:32,150 --> 04:17:33,070
I was like, look at that.

3645
04:17:33,250 --> 04:17:34,130
That's pretty easy.

3646
04:17:34,990 --> 04:17:36,790
The other way, I know there was more of them.

3647
04:17:40,050 --> 04:17:40,790
There you go.

3648
04:17:41,010 --> 04:17:41,270
Nice.

3649
04:17:42,610 --> 04:17:43,750
I'll repair it later.

3650
04:17:44,450 --> 04:17:47,230
Let's get out of here before something else tries to kill
us.

3651
04:17:47,710 --> 04:17:48,870
Yeah, good idea.

3652
04:17:49,170 --> 04:17:51,750
I hate to bring it up, but are we telling your dad about
this?

3653
04:17:53,070 --> 04:18:04,290
clean and all no way he'd kill you right yeah speaking of
coming clean i need your opinion on something what is it

3654
04:18:04,290 --> 04:18:14,590
something i've kept from my brother for a long time do they
ever quit wait wait what what is he gonna say wait what what

3655
04:18:14,590 --> 04:18:21,490
what was the opinion no oh

3656
04:18:27,370 --> 04:18:32,830
my god I'm so... I guess we'll never know now.

3657
04:18:33,410 --> 04:18:34,790
We'll never know.

3658
04:18:37,390 --> 04:18:39,830
He will never know.

3659
04:18:40,450 --> 04:18:41,890
What was the lore?

3660
04:18:42,850 --> 04:18:43,350
You were saying?

3661
04:18:43,790 --> 04:18:45,110
Long before you were born.

3662
04:18:45,390 --> 04:18:47,310
There was an accident at the forge.

3663
04:18:47,450 --> 04:18:48,110
Oh, thank God.

3664
04:18:49,290 --> 04:18:49,930
What?

3665
04:18:50,410 --> 04:18:52,010
Is that why he's blue?

3666
04:18:52,270 --> 04:18:53,230
I couldn't accept it.

3667
04:18:54,210 --> 04:18:55,350
That's why he's blue!

3668
04:18:55,970 --> 04:18:57,470
I went to the Lady of Souls and Alpine to steal him back.

3669
04:18:58,950 --> 04:19:08,290
legions of souls tried to stop me i can still feel them
crawling all over my skin thing is i could only get three of

3670
04:19:08,290 --> 04:19:17,470
his more soul parts back cindry brock just thought he got
knocked out i've been lying to him ever since it's been

3671
04:19:17,470 --> 04:19:23,210
eating at me lately wait but what's the what happened with
the fourth soul right to know that's why he's just murdered

3672
04:19:23,210 --> 04:19:30,430
as should you with your father that's not the same thing How
is he not normal, though?

3673
04:19:30,450 --> 04:19:31,910
He seems pretty normal to me.

3674
04:19:32,430 --> 04:19:33,730
What makes him not normal?

3675
04:19:42,840 --> 04:19:44,480
He's only three, four, or something.

3676
04:19:44,540 --> 04:19:47,860
I mean, he was already a dwarf, so, like, is there really a
difference?

3677
04:19:48,880 --> 04:19:50,220
But what makes him not normal?

3678
04:19:50,400 --> 04:19:51,920
He seemed pretty normal.

3679
04:19:53,820 --> 04:19:54,460
He's blue.

3680
04:19:56,100 --> 04:19:56,580
Doki.

3681
04:19:57,140 --> 04:19:57,620
Doki.

3682
04:19:58,160 --> 04:19:59,080
He's blue.

3683
04:20:02,340 --> 04:20:02,820
Okay.

3684
04:20:03,180 --> 04:20:13,320
But other than being blue, though, Other than being blue,
what else is wrong with him?

3685
04:20:13,700 --> 04:20:14,620
I don't understand.

3686
04:20:17,900 --> 04:20:22,380
Like, yeah, yeah, he's blue, but that's it.

3687
04:20:22,620 --> 04:20:24,280
It doesn't seem too bad.

3688
04:20:25,840 --> 04:20:28,540
He's an angry smoothing.

3689
04:20:29,600 --> 04:20:34,140
All I'm saying, it doesn't seem that bad if he's just blue.

3690
04:20:34,400 --> 04:20:35,120
You did a good thing.

3691
04:20:35,700 --> 04:20:37,200
You saved Brock's life.

3692
04:20:37,380 --> 04:20:40,540
I made a choice.

3693
04:20:41,780 --> 04:20:42,460
I made a choice.

3694
04:20:42,460 --> 04:20:42,520
Oh, Warren.

3695
04:20:42,820 --> 04:20:44,360
Thank you for the super chat.

3696
04:20:44,420 --> 04:20:45,280
Thank you.

3697
04:20:45,380 --> 04:20:47,140
He's an angry smith.

3698
04:20:55,700 --> 04:20:57,300
What do you mean?

3699
04:20:57,640 --> 04:20:58,220
A choice.

3700
04:20:59,320 --> 04:20:59,960
I...

3701
04:21:00,780 --> 04:21:02,360
I couldn't be alone.

3702
04:21:02,700 --> 04:21:03,120
Oh.

3703
04:21:03,540 --> 04:21:05,340
The other dwarves when they saw...

3704
04:21:05,340 --> 04:21:08,140
What's wrong with him besides being...

3705
04:21:08,140 --> 04:21:09,420
Popplot.

3706
04:21:09,640 --> 04:21:09,700
Thank you.

3707
04:21:09,960 --> 04:21:10,820
Thank you.

3708
04:21:10,820 --> 04:21:11,620
Thank you.

3709
04:21:11,960 --> 04:21:14,280
Oh, they got shot at them because he's blue.

3710
04:21:16,740 --> 04:21:18,670
Let's go home before Father wakes up.

3711
04:21:19,440 --> 04:21:21,780
That might be the best idea you've had all night.

3712
04:21:22,680 --> 04:21:23,000
Trey.

3713
04:21:23,700 --> 04:21:24,040
Trey?

3714
04:21:24,640 --> 04:21:25,520
It's a...

3715
04:21:25,520 --> 04:21:27,080
What's a nickname?

3716
04:21:31,000 --> 04:21:31,960
Oh, my God.

3717
04:21:32,080 --> 04:21:34,960
The other dwarves kicked him out because he's blue.

3718
04:21:35,560 --> 04:21:37,180
That's so fucked up.

3719
04:21:38,900 --> 04:21:39,880
That's crazy.

3720
04:21:39,900 --> 04:21:41,420
So I'm not allowed to give you a nickname?

3721
04:21:41,960 --> 04:21:56,600
what that was whatever loke look that was worse well then i
heard it when i said it all right shall we dwarf racism

3722
04:22:01,640 --> 04:22:08,500
yeah what do you think it's weird that is blue did his
brother not fucking look in the mirror and be like why the

3723
04:22:08,500 --> 04:22:17,300
am i blue like especially the other drawers fucking What's
like being racist towards him.

3724
04:22:18,720 --> 04:22:21,520
Tear may not be everything you expected, but a failure.

3725
04:22:22,280 --> 04:22:24,260
You saved him from a terrible fate.

3726
04:22:24,680 --> 04:22:25,680
That's not nothing.

3727
04:22:26,220 --> 04:22:28,660
And hey, maybe he'll be some help with us yet.

3728
04:22:29,180 --> 04:22:29,440
Maybe.

3729
04:22:29,580 --> 04:22:31,480
I guess I'm blue now.

3730
04:22:32,200 --> 04:22:33,340
Maybe he's just colorblind.

3731
04:22:33,660 --> 04:22:35,900
He's probably already got our next hiding place all picked
out.

3732
04:22:36,440 --> 04:22:38,040
Well, let's not make it worse.

3733
04:22:38,060 --> 04:22:42,980
He can look into a pool of water and be like, why am I blue?

3734
04:22:43,080 --> 04:22:44,100
He'd be like, oh, water is blue.

3735
04:22:44,580 --> 04:22:46,800
blue natural but quickly

3736
04:22:54,690 --> 04:23:05,110
are we going oh wait where did he go okay that's like where
are you going oh he's gone that is not the risk that

3737
04:23:05,110 --> 04:23:12,090
concerns me do we trust the path they would put us on i
trust their wisdom and this is the closest thing to hearing

3738
04:23:12,090 --> 04:23:21,210
directly from them you are certain the giants would not come
to war i said that they were wise in my experience that goes

3739
04:23:21,210 --> 04:23:22,290
with being peaceful.

3740
04:23:23,030 --> 04:23:23,650
Oh, little brother.

3741
04:23:24,650 --> 04:23:25,650
Told you we didn't worry.

3742
04:23:27,610 --> 04:23:30,670
Atreus, where have you been?

3743
04:23:32,570 --> 04:23:33,130
Pee?

3744
04:23:33,850 --> 04:23:35,150
You're all hungry!

3745
04:23:35,830 --> 04:23:37,930
It was a very long pee.

3746
04:23:40,350 --> 04:23:42,350
Is everyone as well rested as I am?

3747
04:23:43,190 --> 04:23:43,930
Be right down.

3748
04:23:51,050 --> 04:23:51,430
Mm-hmm.

3749
04:23:55,870 --> 04:24:03,750
this sausage uh sure why not wait what what else would it be

3750
04:24:07,400 --> 04:24:17,220
is that why he uses his hands to eat i suppose you'd like to
try cooking for this law oh when you have three out of four

3751
04:24:17,220 --> 04:24:29,200

know how to cook Don't you look a little blue?

3752
04:24:29,940 --> 04:24:30,420
Alphan.

3753
04:24:31,320 --> 04:24:32,120
You hate Alphan.

3754
04:24:32,340 --> 04:24:33,200
Why would we move there?

3755
04:24:34,820 --> 04:24:36,880
Wait, is that where all the elves live?

3756
04:24:37,520 --> 04:24:38,140
Seeking information.

3757
04:24:39,480 --> 04:24:40,760
The shrine of Groa, young one.

3758
04:24:41,860 --> 04:24:43,420
Your father tells me you found it there.

3759
04:24:44,760 --> 04:24:44,880
Groa?

3760
04:24:45,500 --> 04:24:46,560
The knowledge keeper?

3761
04:24:48,220 --> 04:24:50,200
Oh, maybe there's a secret there I can unlock.

3762
04:24:50,720 --> 04:24:51,200
I?

3763
04:24:51,820 --> 04:24:53,800
You better than the seer who saw everything.

3764
04:24:54,660 --> 04:24:54,760
Hmm.

souls.

04:25:29,820 --> 04:25:33,200
Like, try to figure out what makes him not normal.

3770
04:25:33,680 --> 04:25:36,260
Like, other than being blue.

3771
04:25:36,620 --> 04:25:37,500
You're really up for coming with us?

3772
04:25:37,860 --> 04:25:38,240
I am.

3773
04:25:38,980 --> 04:25:39,640
Whenever you're ready.

3774
04:25:40,600 --> 04:25:42,900
Well, whenever your father's ready, I should say.

3775
04:25:43,900 --> 04:25:48,500
If my counsel might help you towards the answers you seek,
it's the least I can do to repay you.

3776
04:25:49,920 --> 04:25:53,380
Plus, I think it will do me well to see the light of Elfheim
again.

3777
04:25:53,540 --> 04:25:53,880
Hmm.

3778
04:25:54,400 --> 04:25:56,980
That Elf light is some good shit.

3779
04:25:57,660 --> 04:26:03,600
and also bud he used to have hair when he had four souls

3780
04:26:06,860 --> 04:26:17,140
all right now i'm dad again so where did this plan come from
oh from amir of course i was merely asking how you found me

3781
04:26:17,140 --> 04:26:23,880
and he explained the secret prophecies inside the yodnar
shrines fascinating from there we set to taking stock of

3782
04:26:23,880 --> 04:26:31,460
which shrines we'd seen at which point your father recalled
finding growth we not have forks i just feel actually go to

3783
04:26:31,460 --> 04:26:39,640
alpine the prudent course of action became so an area lost
step for the world's smartest man even without feet if

3784
04:26:39,640 --> 04:26:52,450
you'll forgive the levity i was always fond of her talks you
know right and it's good to see yeah 25 had the hair why is

3785
04:26:52,450 --> 04:26:53,690
he building a table

3786
04:27:02,350 --> 04:27:05,010
All right, my companion slot is empty.

3787
04:27:05,230 --> 04:27:06,810
Oh yeah, he has an accessory now.

3788
04:27:08,130 --> 04:27:09,370
Now he has bling.

3789
04:27:15,940 --> 04:27:18,000
All right, I don't think I have anything to upgrade, really.

3790
04:27:19,020 --> 04:27:20,680
Oh wait, uh, yeah.

3791
04:27:22,640 --> 04:27:24,460
Now everything is fine.

3792
04:27:24,800 --> 04:27:26,140
I mean, armor-wise, maybe?

3793
04:27:26,660 --> 04:27:27,400
I feel like, nah.

3794
04:27:27,620 --> 04:27:34,390
I think my current armor is the best so far.

3795
04:27:36,510 --> 04:27:36,990
Yeah.

3796
04:27:41,130 --> 04:27:41,970
What do you mean?

3797
04:27:42,150 --> 04:27:42,890
It's perfect.

3798
04:27:43,850 --> 04:27:45,370
Once... What do you mean?

3799
04:27:46,210 --> 04:27:47,050
I guess for...

3800
04:27:47,050 --> 04:27:48,410
Oh, I guess for Sig...

3801
04:27:49,030 --> 04:27:51,350
I mean, he doesn't really have a place to go.

3802
04:27:51,850 --> 04:27:52,870
I forgot about it.

3803
04:27:53,090 --> 04:27:54,530
I was like, what do you mean?

3804
04:27:54,590 --> 04:27:56,470
It's perfect for all four of us.

3805
04:27:56,930 --> 04:27:57,810
Right behind you.

3806
04:27:58,030 --> 04:28:00,070
I'll meet you at the gateway presently, friends.

3807
04:28:10,910 --> 04:28:11,310
Alright.

3808
04:28:11,610 --> 04:28:12,570
Where are we going now?

3809
04:28:12,890 --> 04:28:13,790
Okay, I'll film.

3810
04:28:15,790 --> 04:28:30,290
area right excuse me sir the squirrel oh it's fraudsy i
promise i'll be brief i assume my goodness what a strapping

3811
04:28:30,290 --> 04:28:39,850
physique capable of an astounding variety of acts of
violence i imagine what is happening this must be the

3812
04:28:39,850 --> 04:28:46,450
squirrel that chains the world tree that delectable aroma
It's me!

3813
04:28:46,750 --> 04:28:46,950
It's me!

3814
04:28:51,350 --> 04:28:52,110
Let's go.

3815
04:28:52,450 --> 04:28:52,830
Ah, yes.

3816
04:28:53,390 --> 04:28:54,390
Amber resin.

3817
04:28:55,130 --> 04:28:57,390
Delightfully nutty with a hint of squidding.

3818
04:29:00,110 --> 04:29:02,210
Not one for gastronomic exploration, I see.

3819
04:29:02,830 --> 04:29:03,090
Wait.

3820
04:29:03,350 --> 04:29:03,650
What?

3821
04:29:03,750 --> 04:29:07,490
If you're Radatosker, why are you so different when we
summon you for help?

3822
04:29:07,850 --> 04:29:09,110
It's a long story.

3823
04:29:10,010 --> 04:29:11,450
What did he look like before?

3824
04:29:11,690 --> 04:29:11,930
I forgot.

3825
04:29:12,230 --> 04:29:12,830
But you are correct.

3826
04:29:13,110 --> 04:29:14,710
I am indeed Radatosker.

3827
04:29:14,710 --> 04:29:19,030
The one you know as Ratatascar is merely one of my spectral
aspects.

3828
04:29:19,730 --> 04:29:21,870
And the particularly nasty one at that.

3829
04:29:22,030 --> 04:29:23,870
I consider him so far removed from my self.

3830
04:29:23,890 --> 04:29:25,890
It's when he used to summon shit.

3831
04:29:26,370 --> 04:29:26,810
Speaking of.

3832
04:29:27,150 --> 04:29:27,590
Yeah.

3833
04:29:28,270 --> 04:29:31,310
When Arteus used to summon stuff.

3834
04:29:32,550 --> 04:29:32,690
Oh.

3835
04:29:33,090 --> 04:29:35,330
I suppose that was to be expected.

3836
04:29:36,210 --> 04:29:36,730
Anyway.

3837
04:29:38,570 --> 04:29:40,850
Now that I've polished off all this resin for you.

3838
04:29:41,490 --> 04:29:42,970
Would you like the seed back?

3839
04:29:44,710 --> 04:29:55,570
it is the seed indeed a seed of igdrasil to be precise since
my dwarven tenants performed their little reconfiguration

3840
04:29:55,570 --> 04:30:05,650
you'll need seeds like these to open up new destinations on
my tree your tree yeah it's like this is the world tree

3841
04:30:05,650 --> 04:30:13,610
nobody owns it squirrel just because you got here first
doesn't mean it's yours it's the world

3842
04:30:20,670 --> 04:30:21,430
Oh.

3843
04:30:22,430 --> 04:30:25,990
So that's why good master Brock needed an alfheim seed.

3844
04:30:26,830 --> 04:30:29,290
Clearly you have important matters afoot.

3845
04:30:30,390 --> 04:30:32,890
That seed you found unlocks Nifleheim of all places.

3846
04:30:33,330 --> 04:30:35,810
A realm as ancient as it is vaguely sticky.

3847
04:30:36,590 --> 04:30:38,870
Swortleheim remains an alfheim.

3848
04:30:39,030 --> 04:30:40,510
We'll do enough of them later.

3849
04:30:44,330 --> 04:30:44,690
Okay.

3850
04:30:49,630 --> 04:30:59,170
you can tell me the tale of your prior visit to the land of
the elves sure i can we killed them the end that's the story

3851
04:30:59,170 --> 04:31:08,650
he's like i don't i don't know we fucking we could pick up
some elves and then kill them the end she can't leave

3852
04:31:08,650 --> 04:31:15,650
midgard that's terrible so then we fought our way through an
army of dark elves to get to the light you interfered in the

3853
04:31:15,650 --> 04:31:21,290
elf war not by choice and they attacked us.

3854
04:31:21,290 --> 04:31:23,370
The dark elves were covering it with their eyes.

3855
04:31:24,230 --> 04:31:27,070
When we freed it, light elves came back.

3856
04:31:27,770 --> 04:31:28,930
He seemed better in Alphine.

3857
04:31:29,690 --> 04:31:29,690
Huh.

3858
04:31:30,570 --> 04:31:31,370
Did they now?

3859
04:31:33,470 --> 04:31:33,930
Alright.

3860
04:31:34,410 --> 04:31:36,130
Let's go to Alphine.

3861
04:31:39,850 --> 04:31:40,450
Alphine.

3862
04:31:41,130 --> 04:31:44,890
Because we're trying to reignite his passion for war.

3863
04:31:45,430 --> 04:31:48,450
If we keep beating up people, he'll start loving war again.

3864
04:31:50,310 --> 04:32:02,170
that's the strat broken history ah not exactly an easy fix
for that i'm gonna call it here guys i think this is a good

3865
04:32:02,170 --> 04:32:10,530
stopping point a new world i know we literally completed the
dwarf world so like i think this is a good stopping point oh
