1
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:53,720
Oh, my box is still back there.

2
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,800
Give me a sec.

3
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,340
Sorry, I forgot about my little booster seat right there.

4
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,380
The cookie's so tight.

5
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,000
Oh my god.

6
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,200
I was so ready to start on time.

7
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,180
You don't understand.

8
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,020
And then, I was ready to start on time.

9
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,100
I was like, Cookie, wake up.

10
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:29,580
Cookie's ready for her 9 to 5.

11
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,140
She's gonna be on time.

12
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,220
She's dead inside because it's 12.30 in the morning.

13
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,920
P.M., morning, P.M., same thing.

14
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,580
I was like, it's time.

15
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,720
I'm ready.

16
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,020
I'm ready to stream.

17
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:55,200
And then, Cookie had to deal with technology problems because, for some reason, I was not showing up on screen.

18
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,320
And I was like, why?

19
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:01,260
Well, I was, but it wasn't tracking.

20
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:04,260
It wasn't showing me moving.

21
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,780
And I was like, why is Cookie dead?

22
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,400
I'm not dead.

23
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm right here.

24
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,460
And then, I was watching a YouTube video, and I was so confused.

25
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,740
I was like, I didn't change anything.

26
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,340
Why Cookie not move?

27
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,640
Cookie dead?

28
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,800
How dead if I'm here?

29
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,040
And then, I was like, okay, let me check my IP address.

30
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,280
Maybe that's why.

31
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:48,640
And then, for some reason, my IP address is... I don't know if it is different or my phone reset itself, but it can't because it's the same as the PC.

32
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,340
When I input the numbers, what do the numbers mean?

33
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:59,680
And so, I changed the numbers to fit the IP address I have that's on my PC, and it worked.

34
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:05,200
And then, I was like, wow, IP address different?

35
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,960
Is that possible?

36
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,240
Who's hacking me?

37
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,580
Did Cookie get hacked?

38
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,800
How IP address different?

39
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,040
I was like, Cookie will worry about that later.

40
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,620
Cookie has to stream.

41
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:36,880
That is future not Croaky problem.

42
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:41,880
That is anime girl Doki problem.

43
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,980
That ain't Croaky's problem.

44
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,980
Cro need not worry.

45
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,160
Cro just play video games.

46
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,940
I'm here now, guys.

47
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,140
Okay, I guess Croaky will give life update.

48
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:07,940
I wrote life.

49
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:19,820
Guys, okay, so, I found out that I might be unintentionally making my health worse in ways.

50
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:26,800
And then, so, you might be wondering, what do you mean by that, Croaky?

51
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,480
What do you mean?

52
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,100
So, you guys know I have a humidifier.

53
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,900
So, sometimes I turn to use it.

54
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:40,320
And I found out a couple of days ago.

55
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,120
I found out by a couple of days, I mean like three days ago.

56
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:52,440
I found out you're not supposed to use tap water with a humidifier.

57
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,340
Croaky didn't know.

58
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,980
And then, because I was like, I'm going to...

59
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,860
So, I was talking to my friend and I was like, I'll be right back.

60
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,100
I'm going to refill my humidifier.

61
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:16,500
And my friend was like, with like boil water, right?

62
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,320
I was like, no.

63
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,760
No, does it matter?

64
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:33,300
And they're like, yes.

65
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:44,300
Croaky's been using tap water this entire time.

66
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,480
In the bedroom.

67
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:50,960
And her humidifier is in the bedroom.

68
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,400
And sometimes in the PC room in the office.

69
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:00,700
So, for those who are like, what's wrong with tap water?

70
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:09,340
So, apparently, if you use tap water, it also, there's like minerals in tap water.

71
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:13,360
And like, it also, it like, not good.

72
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:19,580
Because the minerals and whatever chemical, I don't fucking know.

73
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,200
I don't remember the exact thing.

74
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,860
It like, also goes up into the air.

75
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,730
So, you're breathing in many minerals as well with the humidifier.

76
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:32,870
And also, like, that's how you get mold.

77
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:37,590
So, um, yeah.

78
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:54,510
And also, apparently, it affects like, it affects, it like, destroys the machine quicker.

79
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:58,330
It deteriorates it quicker by using tap water.

80
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,370
So, tap water, not good.

81
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:05,990
And I've had this humidifier for a couple of months now.

82
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:11,650
And I'm pretty sure I've used it at least 20 times, if not more.

83
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:14,990
Oh, no, most definitely.

84
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,470
No, yeah, no, most definitely more than 20.

85
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,130
Yeah.

86
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:19,830
Yeah.

87
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,150
Croaky here for a good time.

88
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,410
I should have boiled.

89
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:39,250
So, now, but, now, now I boiled the water.

90
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:42,510
I think it's still, I think it's still fixable, guys.

91
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:46,290
I think, I think my body is still fixable, guys.

92
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:49,130
I think we can still fix it.

93
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,170
It's not too late.

94
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:51,310
It's never too late.

95
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:59,910
I might have breathed in a lot of minerals, but it's never too late, guys.

96
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:01,450
It's, it's, it's fixable.

97
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:06,810
There's a lot of things that has happened to my body, but it's always fixable, guys.

98
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:11,410
It's, it's, it's always fixable.

99
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:17,850
Never, yeah, never too late, right?

100
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,190
It's never too late.

101
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:22,510
So, Croaky learned.

102
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,810
Croaky learned three days ago.

103
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:29,190
Now, Croaky is hoping that I can still fix it.

104
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,390
I can still fix it.

105
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,750
It's still possible.

106
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,430
I can fix it.

107
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,590
Thank you for the magenta soup.

108
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:40,170
Thank you, thank you.

109
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:42,890
Next scene, thank you for the super chat.

110
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,150
Thank you, thank you.

111
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:46,630
I can fix your dookie at herself.

112
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,930
It's still fixable, guys.

113
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,270
It's never too late.

114
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:54,050
It's, I, I boiled the water now, guys.

115
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,190
My body now knows.

116
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,030
Body now knows.

117
00:09:58,170 --> 00:09:59,390
So, it's okay.

118
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:02,350
It's always still okay, somehow.

119
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:10,010
So, yeah, that's story time.

120
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:13,970
That is story time.

121
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,630
Now, we all know.

122
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:31,890
You may need distilled, not just... Wait, what do you mean boiled ain't enough?

123
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:37,690
Wait, what do you... Wait, what do you mean by that?

124
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,450
Boiled water is not enough.

125
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:43,050
So, my friend lied?

126
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:48,610
My friend said boiled water will fix it.

127
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,470
What, what do you mean?

128
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:56,830
I've been using boiled water the last three days.

129
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:00,030
What do you... It's okay.

130
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,570
Now, I know it's distilled water.

131
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,270
I can still fix it.

132
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,250
It's okay.

133
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:09,510
What's three more days worth of minerals gonna do to me anyway?

134
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:18,970
Guys, what's... Guys, what's three more days worth of minerals gonna do to this body?

135
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,490
It's just three days.

136
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:25,070
Now, I fix it.

137
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:28,770
Now, I fix it with distilled water.

138
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,710
Alright, okay, anyway.

139
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,490
So, that's life update.

140
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:47,930
I'll update you guys later if the... I'll update you guys later if the minerals do anything.

141
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:53,010
I didn't even say it's never... Yeah, it's never too late to change.

142
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,350
Exactly, paladin.

143
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:58,210
Also, boiling water helps with distilled... Okay, yeah, guys.

144
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,830
Now, I know.

145
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,310
So, my friend lied.

146
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:05,870
Okay, anyway.

147
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:09,090
Today, we're gonna be continuing Death's Door.

148
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:12,090
We're gonna play until we finish it, obviously.

149
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:15,650
So, does anyone remember I used controller or not?

150
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,190
It's been a while, guys.

151
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:27,010
Okay, we actually need to look at, like, the... Like, what... Apparently, my... I also read that apparently my IP address has changed and stuff, which is pretty freaky.

152
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,010
I didn't know that.

153
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,190
I didn't know they could do that.

154
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,390
That's fucking weird.

155
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,770
But now, I know.

156
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:37,710
Now, I know.

157
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:38,670
It changes.

158
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,310
Alright, was I using... Okay, I was using controller.

159
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:42,310
That's good to know.

160
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:43,130
Thank you, guys.

161
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:44,230
Wait, what?

162
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:45,510
Which one am I?

163
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:50,070
Well, not... It's not... Okay, restart Steam.

164
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:53,990
Give me back my... My Steam is apparently not working right now.

165
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,250
So, give me a sec.

166
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:56,310
Let me grab my controller.

167
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:58,370
Where'd my roller go?

168
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,530
Where is it?

169
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,330
Where'd it go?

170
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:03,110
Huh?

171
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:05,450
Where'd roller go?

172
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:07,010
Where's my controller?

173
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:09,030
Where'd I put it?

174
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,930
I'm so confused.

175
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:12,410
Oh, there it is.

176
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,050
It's behind all the other stuff.

177
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,270
Alright, I found it.

178
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:20,110
Every day, we learn something new.

179
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,960
And I'll slowly wake up.

180
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:31,740
There we go.

181
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:33,140
Alright.

182
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,340
Okay, let me turn down the sound effects, too.

183
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:41,020
I noticed that the sound effects are very loud sometimes.

184
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,800
So, I'm turning that down a little.

185
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,240
Actually, I'm turning that down a little.

186
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,140
I've noticed that after the stream.

187
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,200
Alright, let me make sure.

188
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,500
Let me get the game up.

189
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,680
Croquis is ready to clock in to a 9-to-5.

190
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,440
Where is Death's Door?

191
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,380
There we go.

192
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,380
I can't wait to finish.

193
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,500
This is a really fun game, though.

194
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,400
I actually really... I forgot all the controls.

195
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,640
As an IQ of a small child, I've already forgotten all the controls.

196
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:14,240
Oh, 32%?

197
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,360
Nice.

198
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,540
That's what I like to see.

199
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,280
Thank you for the super chat.

200
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:21,680
Thank you.

201
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,300
Thank you.

202
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,600
Okay, we're changing this weapon.

203
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,040
This weapon fucking sucked.

204
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,820
The moment I put that weapon on, I fucking died.

205
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,220
Also, I'm lost.

206
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,100
Was it this way?

207
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,200
Oh, I remember.

208
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,160
I'm not lost.

209
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:37,220
Okay, how do I... How do I... How?

210
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,240
Roll... Okay.

211
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,540
How do I do... Oh, there's the... Okay, there we go.

212
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,500
I figured it out.

213
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,320
No more how.

214
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,600
Now it's do.

215
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,960
Handiclocks, thank you for the super chat.

216
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:50,700
Thank you.

217
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:55,000
Please tell your anime girl handler to read the... I threw away the manual.

218
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,120
There's no more manual.

219
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:06,820
There may or may not be any more manual.

220
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:19,540
Croaky was like... Sorry, Doki was like, who needs that?

221
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,760
Doki no need that.

222
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,500
Doki a free bird.

223
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,740
Okay, I think it's this way.

224
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:28,980
Right?

225
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:30,860
I don't remember.

226
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,940
Yeah, it's this way.

227
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,700
I'm going backwards.

228
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,020
And then we go down here.

229
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:37,980
Wait, what?

230
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,000
Where'd the hole at?

231
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,580
Oh, I fell down the hole.

232
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,400
Okay.

233
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,540
It's not this way, guys.

234
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,800
I'm getting a little lost.

235
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,700
Okay, it's this way.

236
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,880
I remember now.

237
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,220
I remember.

238
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,220
It's this way.

239
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:02,180
And then... Guys, I don't remember.

240
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,640
Someone send help.

241
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,520
Someone send help.

242
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,660
Oh, there you go.

243
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,300
I remember.

244
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,740
I don't know how I got here, but I did it.

245
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:17,800
I don't know how I got here, but we don't worry about that.

246
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,700
Okay, there we go.

247
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,680
There we go.

248
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,700
Never talk about the destination.

249
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,460
Just always talk about the destination, not how we got there.

250
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,340
Okay, nice.

251
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,000
I don't know if I can hit the arrow.

252
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,320
I cannot hit the arrow, guys.

253
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,240
I don't know.

254
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,120
I reflected everything else.

255
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,020
Why couldn't I reflect that?

256
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,400
Oh my god, no.

257
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,160
That's fucked up.

258
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,760
They can throw bombs now?

259
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,020
Oh, nice.

260
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,020
Oh, fuck!

261
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,020
It's okay.

262
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,860
It's not okay.

263
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,460
Guys, it's not okay anymore.

264
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,420
How arrow?

265
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,660
Guys, how arrow?

266
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,420
Guys, arrow how?

267
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,020
Okay, no more fancy.

268
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,380
Oh, fuck, no!

269
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,620
Zyko, thank you for the super chat.

270
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,720
Thank you, thank you.

271
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,280
Oh my god.

272
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,160
I hope your leg's okay.

273
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,140
I broke my right leg at the age of 25.

274
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,100
It took six months.

275
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,180
Where do I go?

276
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,260
It was this way, right?

277
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,780
I couldn't run at top speed anymore.

278
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,080
Do take care of yourself as you get older.

279
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,560
Some things are hard to fix.

280
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,700
Don't worry.

281
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,440
Maybe the minerals will get out of my system, guys.

282
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,320
I actually never broken a bone before.

283
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,080
It's crazy.

284
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:49,280
I've done a lot of fucked up shit to my body, but I've never broken a bone, which is pretty insane.

285
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,580
That I have not... I've not done that yet.

286
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,680
Thank you for the super chat.

287
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,720
Thank you, thank you.

288
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,380
Never broken a bone before.

289
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,000
No.

290
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,880
I've like twisted my ankles so many times though, but I've never broken...

291
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,100
Oh, shit, there's a seed.

292
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,780
Alright, time to... time to kidnap.

293
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:11,420
Oh, I can't.

294
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,820
You guys are so lucky I can't kidnap.

295
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,520
Oh, wait, I can.

296
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,660
No, wait, I can't.

297
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,240
God damn it.

298
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,480
I can't kidnap you guys.

299
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,480
Sorry.

300
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:22,880
I know you really want me... I know you really want dad to take custody right now, but I can't.

301
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,320
Okay, I figured it out.

302
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,140
Okay.

303
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,660
Oh my god.

304
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,940
His hammer is so fast.

305
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:36,100
Like, I... I feel like I only have like one sec... like one second.

306
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,380
Okay, now I know the range.

307
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,580
Okay, nice.

308
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,320
I know the range now.

309
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:44,300
Pew!

310
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,180
Okay.

311
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,080
Pew!

312
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,940
Okay, shoot the arrow.

313
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:48,620
Shoot the arrow.

314
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:49,900
Shoot the arrow.

315
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,480
Nice.

316
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,440
Okay, I know the range.

317
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,840
Oh, what?

318
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,200
That hit... what hit me?

319
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,700
What even hit me?

320
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,440
What even hit me?

321
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,360
Oh my god, these guys.

322
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,400
These fuckers.

323
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,680
I don't know how to use arrow.

324
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,160
I forgot.

325
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:16,880
That was something I was trying to... that was something I was trying to do earlier, but then I forgot about it.

326
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,540
Oh wait, I have Kamiha!

327
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:25,490
Oh shit, okay.

328
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:28,550
Okay, this is bad.

329
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:35,470
I was just trying to remember moves, guys.

330
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:38,650
Also, V, thank you for the very first super chat.

331
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:39,910
Thank you, thank you.

332
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:41,670
Also, got my Doki Gamer Subs today.

333
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:42,830
Croaky Cup when?

334
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:43,350
Thank you.

335
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:45,950
Super chat, thank you, thank you.

336
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:47,430
Your very first one.

337
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:49,230
Maybe in the future, I don't know.

338
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,250
I don't know.

339
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:54,930
That would be cool.

340
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:57,050
Would people want to buy a Croaky Cup?

341
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:58,490
Gamer Subs Cup?

342
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:02,990
Because Gamer Subs' whole branding is like half-naked anime woman.

343
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:05,450
So like, would people buy a Cro?

344
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:12,730
Like, my cup is one of the rare cups that's not half-naked suggestive anime woman.

345
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:16,890
It's like one of the few cups that they've done that isn't that.

346
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,930
So I'm just like, would people be interested?

347
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,630
I fucking hate you!

348
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,390
I hope your family dies!

349
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:25,630
Croaky will make sure.

350
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:28,790
Oh my god.

351
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:32,670
Croaky will make sure you have no more family.

352
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:37,290
I will find your wife and child and end the bloodline.

353
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:39,730
You think Croaky won't?

354
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,510
Croaky has nothing to lose.

355
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,050
Caw, caw.

356
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,290
Get over here.

357
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:48,730
I beat you up.

358
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,710
Oh wait, what the fuck?

359
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:54,990
Okay, usually these guys take really fast.

360
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,610
Okay, these guys, fuck these guys.

361
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,870
Actually, fuck these guys.

362
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,210
I hate these guys so much.

363
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:08,690
I hate these guys so much.

364
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:09,770
They're so hard.

365
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:13,950
They're actually so- ah!

366
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:17,830
Okay, we got one of them out of here.

367
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:21,410
Guys, I'm like, waking up right now.

368
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:22,510
I f-

369
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:32,870
I forgot there's no invisible- birds can't swim.

370
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,550
This bird can't swim.

371
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:37,730
I forgot there's no invisible walls.

372
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:39,670
When you go down, you die.

373
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:47,510
Oh, I forgot.

374
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:48,710
Thank you for the super chat.

375
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,130
Thank you, thank you.

376
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,930
I forgot!

377
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:59,290
Just like my hair, as you get older, you lose the very things you hold dear.

378
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,530
It tears your hair and drags on for us.

379
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,170
Thank you for the super chat.

380
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:04,510
Thank you, thank you.

381
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,670
After that, I need to hydrate.

382
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,910
I need to hydrate.

383
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:14,050
Guys, I'm waking up.

384
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:15,630
Okay, I'm locked in now.

385
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:18,370
I'm actually locked in for real now, guys.

386
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:19,210
I swear to God.

387
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:21,710
I swear to God, I'm locked in for real.

388
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:27,030
Okay, I'm locked in now, I swear.

389
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:30,730
Ignore that first shot.

390
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:40,970
I swear to God, I'm locked in for real now.

391
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:44,070
Okay, now I am.

392
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,150
Guys, now I'm locked in.

393
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:50,430
Okay, okay, everything is okay.

394
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,950
I would never lie.

395
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:55,030
Okay.

396
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:59,490
Get the- okay, now I'm locked in for real.

397
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:05,010
Oh my- WHAT?!

398
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:07,490
That should be illegal!

399
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,430
Oh my God.

400
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:15,070
That should actually be illegal.

401
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:17,010
Okay.

402
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:18,670
Alright.

403
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:20,270
This is fine.

404
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:21,790
They're in a line.

405
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:25,670
Oh my God, they're in a line just for- just for me.

406
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:30,630
Oh my God, I hate these guys so much.

407
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,090
Okay, we got another one.

408
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:35,550
Get in a single file, please.

409
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:38,330
Alright, slow- guys, I've learned.

410
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:39,470
See, slow and steady.

411
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:42,230
Slow and steady, guys.

412
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:46,090
Get in the line!

413
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,180
Line!

414
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,520
There we go.

415
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:56,480
Guys, see?

416
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,940
Okay, I just need to not fall in the water.

417
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,140
Imagine if I fell in the water right after.

418
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,640
Okay, it sucks.

419
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,780
Stuck to rot for eternity in a dungeon.

420
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,620
There's nothing down here but grime, filth, and little frogs.

421
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,500
Sounded like- the way he said that sounded like a slur.

422
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:17,940
Damn crows.

423
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,160
Damn.

424
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,600
Are crows the most racist out of the bird family?

425
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,780
No, those are- those are ravens.

426
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,900
Uh, Lord Kurosis, thank you for the super chat.

427
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:30,840
Thank you, thank you.

428
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,540
This is the most rhetorical thing I've ever heard you say.

429
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:36,200
I'll take 20, thank you for the super chat.

430
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,340
Thank you, thank you.

431
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,780
Alright, this way.

432
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,720
Guys, I'm- I gotta plant my seed.

433
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,200
Alright, children, heal- heal daddy.

434
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:45,440
Yay!

435
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,360
What?

436
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,580
How do I get over here?

437
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,700
Okay, I need to get over there.

438
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,520
Alright.

439
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,800
Let's get him out of the way.

440
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,980
Kill the plants too.

441
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,720
Okay, nice.

442
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,300
And then we light that up.

443
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,220
And then we light this up.

444
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,500
Now what to?

445
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,140
Oh.

446
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,220
And then, come over here.

447
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,500
Get- ow!

448
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,420
I- I forgot that happens.

449
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,660
I'm just being silly.

450
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,200
Oh wait, it's timed.

451
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,660
Oh fuck, it's timed?

452
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,160
Wait, I need to hit something then.

453
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,700
What can I hit?

454
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,500
I didn't know it's timed.

455
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,820
I need to be able to hit something.

456
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,520
I only have two.

457
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,820
Oh my god.

458
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:47,920
Also, Mack, thank you for the- thank you for the five gifted ships.

459
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,040
Thank you, thank you.

460
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,040
What do I hit?

461
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,860
Oh, the mushrooms.

462
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,120
Oh, the mushrooms.

463
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:56,700
Okay, mushrooms can be- can be regrown.

464
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,120
Okay.

465
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:00,580
There we go.

466
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:01,580
I did it.

467
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,280
I'm so smart.

468
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,640
I'm so smart.

469
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:07,540
Yippee.

470
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,760
I'm a smart bird.

471
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,140
Yippee.

472
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,820
Oh, I fucking hate these.

473
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,560
I forgot about these guys.

474
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,420
Yeah, cry.

475
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:18,920
Cry to your dad.

476
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,300
Oh, you don't have a dad.

477
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:20,760
I forgot.

478
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,040
That's right.

479
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,580
Don't have any parental figures.

480
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,200
That's why you're out here terrorizing us.

481
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,240
Alright, sorry.

482
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,500
Goki has a lot of hate today.

483
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,140
I've been going through a lot right now.

484
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:42,520
Okay, how do I- wait, no, I'm back here.

485
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,720
Wait, what?

486
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,140
I'm back here.

487
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,780
I have a lot of minerals inside me.

488
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:56,780
There's an overabundance of minerals inside this body right now.

489
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:02,260
Okay, wait, did it destroy the rock?

490
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,260
No, it didn't.

491
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:10,360
How do I get- I feel like I need to use this to destroy something down here.

492
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,860
Okay, I don't know.

493
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,300
I'm so confused.

494
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,120
Okay,

495
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:34,000
where do I- where's the last one?

496
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,200
I don't know where the last one is.

497
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,140
Oh, fuck!

498
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,960
What the-?

499
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,940
Oh, wait, it reset itself because I fucked up.

500
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,700
I almost forgot about that.

501
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,980
Where do I go?

502
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,520
Where do I go?

503
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:52,580
Where do I go?

504
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:55,520
What?

505
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,860
Oh, no.

506
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,230
No,

507
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:17,250
I'm not fast enough!

508
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:21,790
Unless... No, I'm not.

509
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,810
I'm not fast enough.

510
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:29,350
No.

511
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:32,650
Oh, I'm so lost.

512
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:34,730
I'm so lost.

513
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:37,470
Where do I go?

514
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:43,890
Where are the five people that play this game?

515
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:45,350
Children, get over here.

516
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:46,570
Feed the croaky.

517
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:49,390
Get out of here.

518
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:51,310
Croaky has been fed.

519
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:54,150
I don't need you children anymore.

520
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,290
I'm so lost.

521
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:59,010
I'm back here.

522
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,870
Where?

523
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:04,530
Where?

524
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:08,290
Where?

525
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,310
Okay, maybe here?

526
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:13,950
Maybe a secret door?

527
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:18,990
Could be a secret door here, right?

528
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:20,850
Secret door?

529
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:23,830
Oh.

530
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:26,310
No, no secret door.

531
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,610
No secret door.

532
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:30,590
Oh.

533
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:34,170
No, this is where I got the other crow.

534
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:40,570
Guys, where are the three people that play this game?

535
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,650
Where's the last door?

536
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:46,770
Guys, I feel like I've been everywhere.

537
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:50,790
I skipped it?

538
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:51,930
How?

539
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:55,310
How do I just skip something?

540
00:29:57,050 --> 00:30:00,290
Wait, someone is... Oh my god, the one person.

541
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,970
The three people that play this game.

542
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:04,270
Get over here.

543
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:06,370
Where go?

544
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:08,950
Go where?

545
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:12,310
Go down?

546
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:13,090
Here?

547
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:14,890
I'm down.

548
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:17,190
Now where?

549
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:20,430
Now where?

550
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:25,650
Bomb flower on the door?

551
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,670
Still down?

552
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:36,950
Okay, keep going down.

553
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:37,310
Okay.

554
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:40,190
Let me get rid of... Oh, fuck!

555
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,590
Okay, I don't care.

556
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:43,890
Oh my god.

557
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:45,510
Oh my god, maybe I do have to care.

558
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:47,630
Oh my god.

559
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:49,010
Oh my god!

560
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:52,330
Okay, that's a lot of them.

561
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:55,050
Okay, I care now.

562
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:57,350
To my right.

563
00:30:58,530 --> 00:30:59,490
My right?

564
00:30:59,490 --> 00:30:59,670
To my right?

565
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:03,950
Okay, I can get rid of these guys fast.

566
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:06,930
To my right?

567
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:07,350
Here?

568
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:09,410
Is it here?

569
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:12,490
Oh!

570
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:16,290
The frog king's domain!

571
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,770
I'm coming to your house!

572
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,790
Was I here before?

573
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:23,350
I don't remember.

574
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,750
Yeah, no, I wasn't.

575
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,870
How do I get the... Oh!

576
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:31,190
Not there, okay.

577
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:33,710
Okay, not here.

578
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:36,790
I was gonna be like, knock knock!

579
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,970
I'm here for your house!

580
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,250
Oh, wait, have I not done that door yet?

581
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:46,470
I never just went down?

582
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:49,490
Oh shit, I never went down!

583
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:52,550
How did I never... Oh, fuck!

584
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:55,290
How did I never went down?

585
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:58,430
That's crazy, I never went down.

586
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:00,930
That's actually crazy.

587
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:05,650
Croaky doesn't know how to go down, she always goes up.

588
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:09,990
Okay, nice.

589
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:11,550
Not nice.

590
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:13,170
Oh, definitely not nice anymore.

591
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:17,610
Okay, what the fuck?

592
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:19,130
Why are you blocking my way?

593
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:19,770
Oh!

594
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:21,070
Oh my god, I actually dodged that.

595
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:23,270
I don't know how, but I did it.

596
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:26,030
Okay.

597
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:30,130
I can only hit like one time.

598
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:34,110
His hammer speed is so fucking fast, it's actually crazy.

599
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:36,690
Okay, nice.

600
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:40,710
Okay, it's just the bugs.

601
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:42,590
Nothing to worry about.

602
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:45,970
Okay, let me get rid of the fire plant first.

603
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,670
I don't trust him.

604
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:53,690
Nice.

605
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:54,790
Okay, nice.

606
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:57,770
What the fuck, you can dodge?

607
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:58,510
That's illegal!

608
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:02,050
Alright, these guys were easy.

609
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:04,450
Can't believe it.

610
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:07,110
Plant the seed.

611
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:09,010
Okay, I need to actually consume the seed.

612
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:10,030
Hello!

613
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:12,990
I'm a hero to here to free you!

614
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:16,610
Only croaky dodge.

615
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:17,830
Exactly.

616
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:25,290
Goodbye!

617
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:32,950
Your people need you!

618
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:34,650
As in, me.

619
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:37,590
I use your soul for my amusement.

620
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:40,510
Goodbye, crow!

621
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:41,630
Goodbye!

622
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:44,570
Alright, we go this way.

623
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:47,250
What's up here?

624
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,330
What is up here?

625
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:51,830
Hello?

626
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:53,290
Oh, hey, nice.

627
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:57,130
Yoink, taking the kids.

628
00:33:58,130 --> 00:33:59,970
My children now.

629
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:01,710
Where am I?

630
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:05,530
Where the fuck am I?

631
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:09,570
Where did I- what?

632
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,720
Oh, it's the other entrance!

633
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,300
But why go there?

634
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,120
I guess it's like a shortcut.

635
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,100
Okay, yeah.

636
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,120
Figure out a shortcut.

637
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,220
Okay, now we have to go all the way back.

638
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:31,700
I don't need to pay child support.

639
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,780
You have no mom.

640
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,940
Your mom is literally a pot.

641
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:41,100
How do I get to this guy trapped in there?

642
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,140
I guess I need to get a bomb.

643
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:51,440
Maybe the ability I unlocked is a bomb or something.

644
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,080
Okay, we go this way.

645
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,400
Hello, knock knock.

646
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,120
I'm here.

647
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,940
Be wary, living reaper.

648
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,620
I don't need to be worried.

649
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,200
I have minerals in my body now.

650
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,720
I can only go up.

651
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,100
Okay, I don't have bomb.

652
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,080
Goodbye, pots.

653
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,880
Well, I'm ready.

654
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,100
Give me your special skill.

655
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,220
I'm ready to go in.

656
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,520
Don't worry, it's consensual kidnapping.

657
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,360
I already knew he was gonna do that.

658
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:38,260
Awaris.

659
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,400
What are these?

660
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,040
Oh wait, these guys are easy.

661
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:51,720
I almost forgot what they- Let me get rid of the plants.

662
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,420
Get rid of range first.

663
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:59,940
Oh my god, whenever he throws a bomb it like fucks me up because I forget he does that.

664
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,080
I forget his range.

665
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,440
Okay, nice.

666
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:14,280
I can farm more Kamehamehas with these.

667
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:19,660
Okay, don't worry.

668
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,640
I know how to kill these guys.

669
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:22,340
They're tiny.

670
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,260
Oh my god, he's not tiny anymore.

671
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,040
Why is he so big?

672
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:31,170
Oh my god, wait.

673
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:32,810
He's not tiny.

674
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:34,830
I got baited.

675
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:36,070
No, not you.

676
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:37,170
Not you.

677
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:38,350
Not you.

678
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:41,030
Anything but you.

679
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:43,590
No, not him.

680
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:45,450
Oh fuck.

681
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:47,110
Not you.

682
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:49,030
Oh thank god.

683
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:50,190
Oh thank god.

684
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:51,390
Okay, okay.

685
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:54,610
I'm just happy not him.

686
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:56,530
I cannot deal with him.

687
00:36:57,370 --> 00:36:58,870
Okay, one last one.

688
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:02,770
Jesus Christ, get over here.

689
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:03,610
You're not special.

690
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:07,310
Okay, wait, he's green.

691
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:08,310
Oh, he's green!

692
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:13,030
Gotta get rid of green first.

693
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:16,410
I was like, wait, he's green.

694
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:18,450
Wait, I've never seen him green before.

695
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,230
I was like, wait a minute.

696
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:22,530
What does green mean?

697
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:27,690
Oh my god, green was extra scary.

698
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:30,730
Okay, nice.

699
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:31,990
Okay, that was a lot easier.

700
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:34,630
I'm surprised they didn't spam the big guy.

701
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:38,150
If they spammed the big guy, I would've been like, okay, that would've been a problem.

702
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:40,790
Green.

703
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:42,850
No, not the green!

704
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:44,050
Color of the frogs.

705
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:45,670
Hello, bird Jesus.

706
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:49,790
A gift to a fellow crow to aid you on your quest.

707
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:51,070
Thank you, bird Jesus.

708
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,780
On the seventh day, he rose from the chest.

709
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,020
Bombs- I knew it!

710
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,080
I knew it was like...

711
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,420
Okay, I knew it.

712
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,280
I knew it was like a special spell for it.

713
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,800
There were so many areas where I needed a bomb.

714
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,200
How do I do it?

715
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,380
Put your hands up!

716
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,940
I'm making a spirit bomb!

717
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,220
Oh my god.

718
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,080
Wait, I hurt myself.

719
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,760
Wait, what do you mean?

720
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:35,780
Oh shit!

721
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,460
Oh, I chucked bombs!

722
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,680
Oh my god.

723
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,120
Okay, now I know, guys.

724
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,160
Oh my god, that's fucking cool.

725
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:49,980
No, I like- no, I didn't- I like threw it at myself.

726
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,840
I don't know if you guys know this, but when you're next to a grenade, you can hurt yourself, guys.

727
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,800
I know it's a crazy concept.

728
00:38:59,120 --> 00:38:59,920
How much is it?

729
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,600
Oh, it takes like two as well.

730
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,900
Oh my god, it takes so much.

731
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:04,900
Shocker, I know, guys.

732
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,760
This is why you don't throw grenades next to you.

733
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,340
Koki learned today.

734
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,500
Koki learned the concept of ricochet damage.

735
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,840
Okay, open.

736
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,640
No way, ain't no way.

737
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,660
I don't know, I thought I was invincible!

738
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,380
Heh.

739
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:39,980
Heh heh.

740
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:41,060
Okay.

741
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,300
Wait, did he touch my door?

742
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,640
Did he fucking touch my door?

743
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,020
Where am I?

744
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:52,060
Oh, that's a lot of doors I haven't yet opened.

745
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,260
Oh no, it's right here.

746
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,260
Wait, then what's over there?

747
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,700
Wait a minute, then what's down here?

748
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,240
Is there anything down here?

749
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,580
Oh, there is.

750
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,400
Wait, what?

751
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,960
Where does this go?

752
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,960
Oh, it's just secret.

753
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:12,360
Okay, I have fire.

754
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,620
Okay, that should open it.

755
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,000
Secret!

756
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,760
Pick up the money.

757
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:20,860
I'll pick up a door.

758
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:48,780
Sending a query to head office, but they insisted that this was normal procedure and the case was closed.

759
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,420
Still no word from my colleague.

760
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:59,040
He mentioned he was being assigned to assist a powerful witch until some research... it was some research last time we had lunch.

761
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:04,140
He said he was a bit worried before he started, but it turned out she was quite a nice old lady.

762
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,760
I wonder if she had anything to do with the closure.

763
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,000
Okay.

764
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:16,640
I don't think he'll like to know that I used his soul as a door.

765
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:18,360
I hope he's alright.

766
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,580
Well, he's part of a door now.

767
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,740
Is that what all reapers always wanted to be?

768
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,060
Part of a door?

769
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,680
He lives by the door, he dies by the door.

770
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,960
What a great life.

771
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,960
It's like when you die and then your remains are used for corpo.

772
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,940
Thing is, you never leave.

773
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:39,020
You can never escape.

774
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,760
Why is a child here?

775
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,480
So joyful, so carefree, so annoying.

776
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:48,220
I didn't say it, Dragoon.

777
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,740
I didn't say it.

778
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:52,780
Dragoon, you're not annoying, okay?

779
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:56,200
You are a great health resource.

780
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:57,740
Let me tell you that.

781
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:05,080
These funny little forest spirits have appeared out of nowhere.

782
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,560
It caused quite a stir around the office.

783
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,620
God, it's so hot.

784
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,480
Finally, it's getting hotter, though.

785
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,960
It's been, like, so cold for, like, a couple of months now.

786
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,720
I had to file a lot of paperwork due to the infestation.

787
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:18,740
It's great.

788
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,580
I think this one likes me.

789
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:22,840
Oh, wait.

790
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:23,680
No, no!

791
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:27,020
You're not just HP, guys.

792
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,960
I would never.

793
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,980
I planted you for a reason.

794
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,520
Okay, I should have enough to upgrade.

795
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,560
Oh, no, I don't.

796
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,480
We're going full strength.

797
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:41,100
We're maxing out strength and then we'll care about the other stuff later.

798
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,980
Oh, fuck, I almost fell down.

799
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,140
Where did I go?

800
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,340
I forgot which one was the frogs.

801
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:49,900
It's been too long.

802
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,340
Oh, wait, maybe it's right side?

803
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:58,040
I hate it when they, like, bring me to a new area and I'm like, oh, I don't remember which door is for which!

804
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,100
Okay, maybe it's, like, far left.

805
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,360
Lost Cemetery.

806
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,720
Could be far left, right?

807
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:08,820
Ceramic Manor.

808
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,060
I don't remember.

809
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:13,740
No, it's not.

810
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:16,060
Which door is which one?

811
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,320
It's down?

812
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:19,860
Oh, my God, I'm so lost.

813
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:21,720
Croaky Lost.

814
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:24,660
Okay, it's downstairs.

815
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:26,920
Is it this one?

816
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:28,760
Oh, it's here.

817
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:29,500
Okay, it's here.

818
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:30,560
I figured it out, guys.

819
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,220
Mushroom Dungeon.

820
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,260
Is it Mushroom?

821
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:37,460
Or is it over?

822
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:38,640
Oh, we'll find out.

823
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,620
We'll fucking find out.

824
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:42,540
Trial and error.

825
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,500
Where is this?

826
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:44,540
Okay, it's not here.

827
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:48,500
Okay, it's Mushroom.

828
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:52,680
I opened it and I was like, why am I outside?

829
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:55,680
Okay, there we go.

830
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,720
I can free him now.

831
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:58,360
And you shall be freed.

832
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,860
Oh, I didn't... Okay, whoops.

833
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:02,940
You shall be freed.

834
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:03,700
I did it.

835
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:07,720
Little bird save Grunt.

836
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,340
Grunt be forever, thank little bird.

837
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:10,880
Yay!

838
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:12,360
Is that it?

839
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:15,240
You're not gonna give me anything?

840
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:18,080
I didn't do this for free, big guy.

841
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,840
I would like some rewards, thank you very much.

842
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:25,100
I know, like, there's more things for me to explode somewhere.

843
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:30,920
There's, like, other areas to, like, blow up.

844
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:32,600
But where?

845
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:33,280
Oh, here.

846
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:34,920
Ow.

847
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:36,540
Whoops.

848
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:39,040
That's alright, that's what the children here are for.

849
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,820
Alright, where is this?

850
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:45,100
Oh, okay.

851
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,400
Oh, wait, there's another area!

852
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:51,380
Where does this go?

853
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:52,920
Where am I?

854
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:56,180
Where the fuck am I?

855
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:00,220
Okay, I need to recharge this then.

856
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:03,700
Okay.

857
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,600
There we go.

858
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:07,760
Where the fuck am I?

859
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:13,050
Okay, this way?

860
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:15,150
Oh!

861
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:16,470
Praise be!

862
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:18,990
Please grant me HP!

863
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:20,670
Bird God!

864
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:23,270
I request HP!

865
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:27,990
I have two?

866
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:29,310
Wait, that's not an HP!

867
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:31,710
Wait!

868
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:35,550
I need to find two more, goddammit.

869
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:37,950
Bird God is so stingy.

870
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:42,170
Alright, we found this area.

871
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:46,270
I don't remember all the areas that have—oh, thank god.

872
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:48,950
I knew planting you was the right idea.

873
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:52,430
Oh, wait, right—okay, so...

874
00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:55,850
Obviously, it should be around here.

875
00:45:56,890 --> 00:45:58,410
Where there's, like, a secret area.

876
00:45:59,810 --> 00:46:00,990
Yeah, I knew it.

877
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:02,310
Yay!

878
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:03,750
Upgrade!

879
00:46:05,290 --> 00:46:06,110
Is there anything here?

880
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:10,770
No, this is different.

881
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:15,730
Oh, down here!

882
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:18,190
Yeah.

883
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:20,710
Yeah, I remember.

884
00:46:21,890 --> 00:46:23,510
And then, up here.

885
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:26,050
And then, kaboom.

886
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:30,870
And then, kaboom.

887
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:35,370
Yay!

888
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:38,750
I got a branch!

889
00:46:41,010 --> 00:46:43,490
I wonder what creature this used to be attached to.

890
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:44,510
Oh, wait, it does nothing.

891
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:45,970
Okay, it was just collectible.

892
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:47,830
Nevermind, I wasted my time.

893
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:49,310
Nevermind.

894
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:51,410
I got a cool stick!

895
00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:56,090
I wasted my time and got a cool-ass stick.

896
00:46:58,190 --> 00:46:59,210
Where do I go?

897
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:00,390
It's here, right?

898
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:01,750
Oh, shit.

899
00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:06,390
Alright, and then we go this way.

900
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:08,890
I should have enough now.

901
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:10,630
I'm gonna fucking- I'm coming over.

902
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:13,850
I didn't pay rent, but I'm gonna come over anyway!

903
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:17,950
Boom!

904
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:20,590
That's five booms!

905
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:25,090
The crooked crow doesn't give up easily, huh?

906
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:29,390
You know out there, I'm the tiny frog in a big pond.

907
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:32,810
But here, I'm the top of the food chain.

908
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:37,630
And my favorite meal is all those delicious stray souls.

909
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:40,170
You got your work cut out for you, Reaper.

910
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:42,650
My subjects will see to that.

911
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:45,210
Then it's crow pie for supper.

912
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:47,290
And trifle for dessert.

913
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:50,550
Our chef makes the fantastic trifle.

914
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:54,310
That's five booms!

915
00:47:54,690 --> 00:47:55,470
Oh, I missed.

916
00:47:55,650 --> 00:47:55,910
Sorry.

917
00:47:56,690 --> 00:47:58,950
I don't wanna waste my resources, so I'm just gonna slap you.

918
00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:01,950
Oh, I can't even slap you.

919
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:03,810
Oh, there you go.

920
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:11,270
Just don't wanna waste it!

921
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:13,770
Flooded fortress.

922
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:18,950
Okay, now I have to charge up my- I need to charge this up.

923
00:48:20,210 --> 00:48:21,570
Do the mushrooms grow back?

924
00:48:21,590 --> 00:48:22,510
Oh, they don't.

925
00:48:22,870 --> 00:48:23,950
Okay, we need to- Oh, they do!

926
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:24,530
Okay, nice.

927
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,050
Child, come with me.

928
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:30,450
Hello?

929
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:32,250
Froggy frog?

930
00:48:33,770 --> 00:48:34,990
Are you here?

931
00:48:36,810 --> 00:48:37,290
Slap!

932
00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:38,330
Whoa!

933
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:41,090
What happens if I- Oh, it doesn't do anything.

934
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:42,050
Oh, that's cool.

935
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:45,910
I need to remember not to, like, accidentally walk off.

936
00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:48,250
Because they don't have invisible walls.

937
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:55,310
Because they'd punish you if you, like- They actually punish you for not going- For not having hand-eye coordination.

938
00:48:55,870 --> 00:49:00,850
Imagine having really bad hand-eye coordination trying to fucking walk in a straight line.

939
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:06,770
Okay, that should open something.

940
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:08,410
No, I need to actually- What?

941
00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:09,830
Bomb?

942
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:12,490
No?

943
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:14,370
Not bomb?

944
00:49:14,830 --> 00:49:15,450
Maybe arrow?

945
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:19,450
Oh, okay.

946
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:21,670
Okay, it just doesn't like fire.

947
00:49:22,370 --> 00:49:23,630
Understandable, understandable.

948
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:27,230
Just doesn't like fire.

949
00:49:31,290 --> 00:49:33,250
Alright, let's see.

950
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:36,710
Where else do I go?

951
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:38,210
How do I get up here?

952
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:42,410
Is there- Okay, there's a guy over there.

953
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:45,510
Hello?

954
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:50,090
For the frog fortress, there's surprisingly a very lack of frogs.

955
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:53,970
There's a huge lack of frogs.

956
00:49:57,330 --> 00:49:59,150
I don't know if I'm going the right way.

957
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:04,090
There's so many, like, passages.

958
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:05,690
Okay,

959
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,340
there's a guy that's just staring.

960
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:18,640
He's like, what a lovely day to just look out there.

961
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:19,260
Goodbye.

962
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:22,380
Oh, I knew there was a child here.

963
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:25,860
Oh, secret!

964
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,560
What a worthless secret.

965
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:31,760
I can't even teleport.

966
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:34,600
Can't believe it.

967
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:35,920
Amy- oh my god.

968
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:38,600
That means I have to backtrack here whenever I can teleport.

969
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:44,100
AHHHHHH That's fine.

970
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:46,840
That's fine.

971
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:49,980
I don't have it.

972
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:52,740
Whenever I can do whatever that shit is.

973
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:54,260
I can't jump, guys.

974
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,800
I don't have the ability to jump.

975
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:03,940
What did I miss at?

976
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:05,280
What?

977
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:08,780
What?

978
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,780
I guess that was just a secret.

979
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:16,200
Look, this bird was not meant to go up.

980
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:19,360
Can you read?

981
00:51:23,170 --> 00:51:25,050
Wait, can I actually ground pound?

982
00:51:29,830 --> 00:51:30,430
Oh!

983
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:42,580
Oh my god, I figured it out all by myself.

984
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:46,680
Secret tunnel!

985
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:48,780
Yay!

986
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,300
Holy shit, lots of secret.

987
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:56,600
I could go down here, but then I could get this.

988
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,480
I could've gone there though.

989
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:01,860
What is over there?

990
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:04,100
Wait, what is over there?

991
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:05,960
Oh my god, they go all the way back.

992
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:08,120
Oh no, oh that guy's drowning.

993
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:10,200
I'm so smart.

994
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:11,400
Okay, I'm gonna do that again.

995
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:13,100
I wanna know what all the way there is.

996
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:17,420
Okay, I'm so smart.

997
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:20,930
Phew, figured that out all by myself.

998
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:26,440
Roll, roll, roll.

999
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,120
Hello, what do I have over here?

1000
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:35,580
Hello everybody.

1001
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:37,980
Hey guys.

1002
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:40,800
How do I get over there?

1003
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:43,360
Oh, okay.

1004
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:44,540
Nice.

1005
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:46,700
Anything over here?

1006
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,560
Oh my god, it's such a maze.

1007
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,280
Oh my god.

1008
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:56,660
Oh, it's back here, okay.

1009
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:58,220
Oh fuck, I'm drowning.

1010
00:52:58,640 --> 00:52:59,280
Okay, I'm okay.

1011
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:00,540
JK, I'm okay now.

1012
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:02,800
What happened?

1013
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:03,700
I'll never know.

1014
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:05,080
I'm okay though.

1015
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:07,780
I was never drowning by the way.

1016
00:53:11,070 --> 00:53:12,570
I don't like this area.

1017
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:18,750
This area is way too confus- There's so many passages that I'm actually so confused right now.

1018
00:53:20,310 --> 00:53:23,510
A bird was never meant to think this far.

1019
00:53:24,430 --> 00:53:25,130
Hello children.

1020
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:27,090
Come to daddy crow.

1021
00:53:29,090 --> 00:53:30,850
Oh, I have to go this way?

1022
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:33,510
Where are all the frogs?

1023
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:42,110
Wait, I swear I've only found one fucking frog and he's supposed to be the king of frogs.

1024
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:44,870
If he's the king of frogs, why is there one frog?

1025
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:46,250
Who are you a king of?

1026
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:49,470
Oh, I got it.

1027
00:53:51,790 --> 00:53:53,770
Wait, but I wanna get rid of these boxes.

1028
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:56,230
I knew there was a child here.

1029
00:53:57,510 --> 00:53:58,290
That's right.

1030
00:54:00,730 --> 00:54:03,030
Oh my god, it's guarded by one guy.

1031
00:54:05,510 --> 00:54:08,210
Like, what is that one guy gonna do?

1032
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:11,170
He takes 20 seconds to load in an arrow.

1033
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:16,750
Okay, this way?

1034
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:20,710
I'll grab the bomb.

1035
00:54:20,830 --> 00:54:22,290
The bomb is the strongest, technically.

1036
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:26,030
Okay, is there an arrow here?

1037
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:28,170
No?

1038
00:54:28,990 --> 00:54:30,450
Alright, we go this way.

1039
00:54:31,450 --> 00:54:33,330
Then unlock this door.

1040
00:54:35,850 --> 00:54:38,910
And then... oh my god, what you gonna do?

1041
00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:39,370
Nothing.

1042
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:42,110
Oh fuck!

1043
00:54:42,270 --> 00:54:43,430
Okay, you did something.

1044
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:45,490
Got a little cocky there.

1045
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:46,770
Where are the children?

1046
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:51,050
How would I plant my seed?

1047
00:54:55,350 --> 00:54:56,550
Where are they?

1048
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:00,070
Where are the pots?

1049
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:06,080
Hey there.

1050
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:07,540
An intruder!

1051
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:10,820
And- Wow, they're called the red shirts?

1052
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:11,880
Wow.

1053
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:14,420
Okay.

1054
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,280
And they're intruding!

1055
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:21,140
You'll regret this flierent trespass.

1056
00:55:24,910 --> 00:55:26,910
You're done for now, little bird.

1057
00:55:27,350 --> 00:55:29,250
You're gonna get crushed!

1058
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:31,990
Oh fuck, hey.

1059
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:37,430
You're certainly persistent, crooked crow.

1060
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:39,890
Do you like my armor?

1061
00:55:40,410 --> 00:55:43,150
It was a size too small, but I think I make it work.

1062
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:48,110
Can you believe I found it just lying around on a nearby corpse?

1063
00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:51,830
Here's just another bleeding heart standing in the way of progress.

1064
00:55:51,970 --> 00:55:54,130
This is the natural order!

1065
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:56,270
The strong survive!

1066
00:55:57,350 --> 00:55:58,670
Hop on, small fry!

1067
00:55:59,930 --> 00:56:00,830
Oh yeah?

1068
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:03,250
You heard him!

1069
00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:04,190
Hop on!

1070
00:56:04,590 --> 00:56:07,910
I sure hope I don't end up between those chubby green cheeks.

1071
00:56:08,110 --> 00:56:09,690
You know, some people will pay for that.

1072
00:56:09,970 --> 00:56:11,030
You know what I just found out?

1073
00:56:11,390 --> 00:56:13,630
Okay, so like...

1074
00:56:13,630 --> 00:56:15,650
This popped up in my- okay, I don't know why.

1075
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:17,130
Okay, this reminded me of this.

1076
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:19,250
But like, last night I was reading Twitter.

1077
00:56:19,830 --> 00:56:22,630
And I get all my news on Twitter, if you guys didn't know that.

1078
00:56:22,730 --> 00:56:24,550
I feel like you guys know with my brain rot.

1079
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:30,490
And like, they're saying like, the reason why the Matrix film deteriorated in the trilogy...

1080
00:56:30,490 --> 00:56:36,810
Is because the Wachowski sisters now, they were the Wachowski brothers.

1081
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:41,130
And like, after the first film, they got into a sex dungeon.

1082
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:45,650
And like, got like, injected with ketamine and shit.

1083
00:56:46,190 --> 00:56:51,830
And it like, fucked up their minds.

1084
00:56:52,230 --> 00:56:55,630
They got into like, this BDSM sex dungeon thing.

1085
00:56:56,190 --> 00:56:58,030
And wait, you guys didn't know that?

1086
00:56:58,030 --> 00:57:02,350
Yeah, and then I read the article and it was like, true.

1087
00:57:02,690 --> 00:57:05,030
And I was like, no, that can't- there's no way.

1088
00:57:10,490 --> 00:57:13,310
Wait, you guys didn't know- no, it's actually true!

1089
00:57:13,870 --> 00:57:16,590
It's actually- it's actually true!

1090
00:57:17,330 --> 00:57:23,030
They got into like, some freaky sex dungeon BDSM shit after the first film.

1091
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:35,230
And then like, the reason why the films deteriorated is because like, they were- they got injected with ketamine.

1092
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:40,070
And like, it fried their brains after the first film.

1093
00:57:43,470 --> 00:57:49,550
Yeah, so that's why the later movies got really weird.

1094
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:59,450
Yeah, I said it's not- it's not a fanfic, it's actually true!

1095
00:57:59,890 --> 00:58:06,410
It's a true story, I was- I even- I even- I'm linking it, I'm linking it, I'm linking the thing.

1096
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:08,650
I was like, what the fuck?

1097
00:58:11,830 --> 00:58:14,550
Mickey, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

1098
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:17,470
You should see Jupiter ascending, it's so ass.

1099
00:58:17,550 --> 00:58:18,750
Okay, look- alright.

1100
00:58:19,810 --> 00:58:22,710
Look at- here, click this, and then like, look at the replies.

1101
00:58:23,570 --> 00:58:31,120
I was like, there's no- no fucking way.

1102
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:36,480
Like, look- look at the replies, it's actually crazy.

1103
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:42,480
I was like, holy fuck, what?

1104
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:49,540
Anyway, um, are you sure this isn't the Minerals talking?

1105
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,280
Robin, thank you for the super chat, thank you.

1106
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:53,320
No, it's not!

1107
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:56,380
It's not the Robin, it's not the Minerals in my system!

1108
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:05,680
It's not the Minerals, I swear.

1109
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:13,420
You can even see in the Wikipedia, it's actually in the Wikipedia!

1110
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:23,260
I even looked up their Wikipedia, and what it said like that, they got into some freaky sex dungeon shit.

1111
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:26,280
Because like, um, what's her name?

1112
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:31,400
Laura, or whatever, the first Wachowski sister?

1113
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:45,560
It was like, yeah, like, they started, they started, after like, um, the wife divorced her because like, she cheated on her with the BDSM mistress.

1114
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:52,600
That they met at the sex dungeon.

1115
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:55,500
Oh my god!

1116
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:06,910
And then the BDSM mistress was like, one of the best mistresses out there.

1117
01:00:07,710 --> 01:00:09,790
I was like, holy shit!

1118
01:00:10,470 --> 01:00:12,590
I did not know this about the Matrix!

1119
01:00:14,450 --> 01:00:15,730
Fun fact!

1120
01:00:16,350 --> 01:00:18,550
Fun fact about the Matrix series.

1121
01:00:19,070 --> 01:00:21,470
Isn't that such a fun fact, guys?

1122
01:00:22,010 --> 01:00:23,550
What a fun fact.

1123
01:00:24,350 --> 01:00:25,570
I sure...

1124
01:00:28,930 --> 01:00:37,230
Okay, the more you learn with Croaky, and you believe this video got on Twitter, why?

1125
01:00:37,570 --> 01:00:39,170
Also, how is this related?

1126
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:45,350
Because he was like, I sure hope I don't get squished between those cheeks, and I just thought about...

1127
01:00:47,470 --> 01:00:51,070
Thank you for the super chat, D-Dragon, thank you, thank you.

1128
01:00:51,070 --> 01:00:53,530
My fun is like my optimism.

1129
01:00:53,990 --> 01:00:54,590
God.

1130
01:00:57,350 --> 01:00:58,730
Alright, nice.

1131
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:03,410
Wait, it's actually, yes it is!

1132
01:01:03,650 --> 01:01:05,330
Why would I lie?!

1133
01:01:05,330 --> 01:01:08,830
Why would Croaky lie?

1134
01:01:14,150 --> 01:01:16,910
Alright, let's go all in on the strength.

1135
01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:19,250
He said the strongest will survive.

1136
01:01:19,430 --> 01:01:21,430
I shall be the strongest.

1137
01:01:21,670 --> 01:01:23,390
Croaky never lies.

1138
01:01:24,710 --> 01:01:27,070
I didn't need to know this.

1139
01:01:27,490 --> 01:01:30,470
But it was such a fun fact!

1140
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:34,770
Did you guys have fun?

1141
01:01:40,450 --> 01:01:41,290
Alright.

1142
01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:48,650
It was a fact.

1143
01:01:49,650 --> 01:01:51,490
It was a cool fact.

1144
01:01:52,810 --> 01:01:54,810
Fun is the strongest.

1145
01:01:55,310 --> 01:01:58,490
It was a cool... Okay, how about a cool fact?

1146
01:01:58,930 --> 01:02:00,650
A cool fact is like fun.

1147
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:11,640
Alright, hello.

1148
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:13,520
Oh fuck, okay.

1149
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:19,640
Oh fuck, okay, I didn't realize he was gonna slam.

1150
01:02:21,820 --> 01:02:25,120
I like the Matrix episodes.

1151
01:02:29,540 --> 01:02:31,860
Okay, I'm just gonna arrow these guys for now.

1152
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:33,680
Because they're bothering me.

1153
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:36,720
Wait, what?

1154
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:42,820
How can I... Oh, wait, I thought like... I was like, wait, can I hit that?

1155
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:43,760
It's a boomerang.

1156
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:46,480
So I should be able to hit that, right?

1157
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:47,700
Theoretically.

1158
01:02:50,420 --> 01:02:51,620
That was crazy.

1159
01:02:51,620 --> 01:02:51,720
That was crazy.

1160
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:55,020
I did not... That still blows my mind.

1161
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:59,100
That like, they were part of a sex dungeon.

1162
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:05,980
Alright, nice.

1163
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:11,300
I'm not gonna ignore that.

1164
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:15,860
I'm still trying to process it.

1165
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:18,120
That like, blew my mind.

1166
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:25,420
The director is a Matrix.

1167
01:03:29,380 --> 01:03:31,480
Alright, let's get this guy out of here.

1168
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:32,840
Get out of here.

1169
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:34,560
Get out of here.

1170
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:38,480
All that leather?

1171
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:41,500
I didn't think about the leather that way.

1172
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:52,780
Everything I learned about BDSM has been against my will.

1173
01:03:55,020 --> 01:03:56,200
Whoops.

1174
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:01,600
Guys, did you not have fun?

1175
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:07,660
Okay.

1176
01:04:09,530 --> 01:04:10,460
Let's see.

1177
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:14,960
Alright.

1178
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:20,980
Ow!

1179
01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:21,520
Fuck!

1180
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:22,360
I thought, okay.

1181
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:24,360
I know why I didn't learn my lesson.

1182
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,280
I know why I thought it would be different this time.

1183
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:33,400
Okay, let's get these guys out of here.

1184
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:35,040
You're annoying.

1185
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:36,600
You're annoying.

1186
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:40,940
Okay, we go down?

1187
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:43,180
We go down this way.

1188
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:46,720
Where are the frogs at?

1189
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:48,220
I was promised frogs!

1190
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:50,800
Why is it one guy?

1191
01:04:53,740 --> 01:04:55,140
Where the fu- Oh shit!

1192
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:55,740
Oh no.

1193
01:04:55,820 --> 01:04:56,880
Oh no, this is bad.

1194
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:59,020
Where are the frogs?

1195
01:04:59,280 --> 01:04:59,760
Ow!

1196
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:03,060
Sorry, I demanded too many frogs.

1197
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:09,080
Moral of the story, don't do drugs, kids.

1198
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:11,180
Thank you for the super chat.

1199
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:12,520
Thank you, thank you.

1200
01:05:12,580 --> 01:05:13,180
No name.

1201
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:17,460
Simpa, thank you for the super chat.

1202
01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:18,560
Thank you, thank you.

1203
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:19,380
Why would I lie?

1204
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:21,800
This is coming from the person who lapsed in Dynasty War.

1205
01:05:21,860 --> 01:05:23,360
I didn't relapse!

1206
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:25,520
I'm all better now.

1207
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:27,460
Boom.

1208
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:28,820
Oh wow.

1209
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:30,800
He fell into the water.

1210
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:34,980
I didn't relapse.

1211
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:36,140
I'm reformed.

1212
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:37,000
That's different.

1213
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:41,060
Guys, I swear to god, I'm reformed.

1214
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:42,960
Okay.

1215
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:45,960
Nice, he's dead.

1216
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,780
Can you remember how to get there?

1217
01:05:48,860 --> 01:05:49,700
Oh, it's this way.

1218
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:50,180
Okay.

1219
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:51,520
It's been a while.

1220
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:56,640
I know I- Doki, you died like five sec- Guys, it's been a while.

1221
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:00,520
Okay, and then we go- I'm just gonna skip through all of these.

1222
01:06:01,620 --> 01:06:03,420
Unless they like start chasing me.

1223
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:06,620
Yeah, they're not chasing me, right?

1224
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:07,820
Is he gonna jump down?

1225
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:09,920
There's no way he's gonna jump down, right?

1226
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:11,580
He can.

1227
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:12,900
He physically can't go down.

1228
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:14,660
Yeah, he can.

1229
01:06:14,780 --> 01:06:15,040
Okay.

1230
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:15,840
That's good.

1231
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:23,700
I wasn't sure, so I have to like- I just wanna be sure I'm not gonna see like big boy over there jumping down on me.

1232
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:28,520
Okay, nevermind, he jumped down.

1233
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:29,560
Oh, he still can!

1234
01:06:29,660 --> 01:06:30,120
He still can!

1235
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:31,900
Wait, it's still possible.

1236
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:32,720
He can't jump.

1237
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:35,720
Ah!

1238
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:42,100
Oh my god, I'm like getting- I'm actually- Oh, I need to get these guys out of here.

1239
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:47,000
Come on, blow your- Blow your hole.

1240
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:48,240
There you go.

1241
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:50,080
I don't think he can.

1242
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:51,360
Oh, no, he can.

1243
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:52,660
Wait, that's illegal!

1244
01:06:53,420 --> 01:06:53,980
That's illegal!

1245
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:55,780
That's so illegal!

1246
01:06:56,740 --> 01:06:58,300
What you doing here?

1247
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:00,620
Go back on high ground!

1248
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:04,160
Wait, wait, wait.

1249
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:06,420
El Mexican, thank you for the super chat.

1250
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:07,420
Thank you, thank you.

1251
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:10,340
I have to go to my appointment with my therapist, Doki.

1252
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:13,660
I guess I have a topic to share now!

1253
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:15,020
See you later!

1254
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:19,340
Oh, you wanna share your fun fact with your therapist?

1255
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:24,880
What a great fun fact.

1256
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:28,720
I'm glad- I'm glad you're sharing other facts too with her.

1257
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:32,520
Thank you for the super chat.

1258
01:07:32,660 --> 01:07:33,480
Thank you, thank you.

1259
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:35,520
Serfin, thank you for the super chat.

1260
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:36,640
Thank you, thank you.

1261
01:07:37,980 --> 01:07:41,640
Oh, Brainwrap Bird of the Interwebs, what is your-

1262
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:47,760
That's - That's it.

1263
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:49,480
That's the fun fact of the day.

1264
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:52,060
Unless...

1265
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:53,880
That's today's fun fact.

1266
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:55,280
Don't worry.

1267
01:07:55,940 --> 01:07:57,780
Croquis will come back with more fun.

1268
01:07:58,380 --> 01:07:59,480
At another time.

1269
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:03,840
Alright.

1270
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:08,800
Thank you for the super chat.

1271
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:09,820
Thank you, thank you.

1272
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:11,380
Import- Exactly.

1273
01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:12,300
They're very important!

1274
01:08:12,540 --> 01:08:13,240
They're educational!

1275
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:15,420
Now you know!

1276
01:08:17,780 --> 01:08:21,480
If you guys ever wondered why the trilogy became like that, now you know.

1277
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:25,380
That's crazy.

1278
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:29,360
Apparently it's like supposedly common knowledge, but apparently not.

1279
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:34,560
People replies are like, wait, people did not know that?

1280
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:36,240
It's common knowledge.

1281
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:37,660
Apparently not!

1282
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:42,080
Apparently it was absolutely not common knowledge.

1283
01:08:46,950 --> 01:08:48,810
Okay, let's get him out of the way.

1284
01:08:49,630 --> 01:08:50,990
Define common.

1285
01:08:53,370 --> 01:08:53,770
Common!

1286
01:08:53,770 --> 01:08:56,530
That's- That's what it's like to get older, guys.

1287
01:09:02,450 --> 01:09:03,770
Welcome to adulthood.

1288
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:09,100
Alright.

1289
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:10,600
Let's see.

1290
01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:11,640
Okay, we gotta kill these guys.

1291
01:09:12,620 --> 01:09:14,760
I think it- Yeah, I was gonna- Oh, that looked- That's cool.

1292
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:15,300
Oh, shit!

1293
01:09:15,740 --> 01:09:16,140
Seeds!

1294
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:17,500
Come on, children!

1295
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:19,340
Give me my HP, child!

1296
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:21,000
Yay!

1297
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:21,580
Health!

1298
01:09:23,340 --> 01:09:23,920
Yippee!

1299
01:09:29,140 --> 01:09:30,680
Hey, you know the best part?

1300
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:33,380
You can spread the knowledge to other people.

1301
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:39,300
Now other people shall know about the beautiful knowledge that you gained.

1302
01:09:43,810 --> 01:09:46,310
Oh my god, really?!

1303
01:09:46,310 --> 01:09:47,290
What?!

1304
01:09:47,290 --> 01:09:47,710
Oh!

1305
01:09:48,170 --> 01:09:48,950
This is not fair.

1306
01:09:50,750 --> 01:09:51,890
That was not fair.

1307
01:09:52,010 --> 01:09:53,790
Oh my god, he took the bullet!

1308
01:09:56,550 --> 01:09:58,750
Okay, well now I know it does that.

1309
01:10:00,310 --> 01:10:00,750
Okay.

1310
01:10:02,270 --> 01:10:06,070
I wanna like- Okay, now I know it does that much damage.

1311
01:10:06,170 --> 01:10:07,630
I don't know how much damage that does.

1312
01:10:10,170 --> 01:10:11,210
We go this way.

1313
01:10:12,270 --> 01:10:13,790
And then we hit this thing.

1314
01:10:14,730 --> 01:10:16,130
And then we go this way.

1315
01:10:16,350 --> 01:10:16,570
Oh!

1316
01:10:18,110 --> 01:10:19,130
We hit that.

1317
01:10:19,410 --> 01:10:21,370
Oh, you think- Oh, shit.

1318
01:10:21,670 --> 01:10:22,090
Nevermind.

1319
01:10:22,230 --> 01:10:23,210
I was gonna say...

1320
01:10:26,830 --> 01:10:28,370
Okay, get this guy out of the way.

1321
01:10:28,630 --> 01:10:29,930
I need to kill this guy, though.

1322
01:10:34,150 --> 01:10:35,610
Come on, you're almost dead!

1323
01:10:35,790 --> 01:10:36,210
Nice.

1324
01:10:39,090 --> 01:10:39,970
We get his.

1325
01:10:40,770 --> 01:10:41,610
Get this.

1326
01:10:42,830 --> 01:10:46,450
I think his therapist will need- Wait, can I chuck- Oh, fuck.

1327
01:10:46,570 --> 01:10:46,730
Okay.

1328
01:10:50,410 --> 01:10:51,590
Get over here!

1329
01:10:51,730 --> 01:10:54,250
Okay, I was gonna say, he better fucking die after that.

1330
01:10:56,590 --> 01:10:58,090
Oh, which way- Oh, seeds!

1331
01:10:59,670 --> 01:11:00,610
Come here, children.

1332
01:11:02,230 --> 01:11:03,290
Croaky needs HP.

1333
01:11:05,090 --> 01:11:06,930
It's Croaky's custody hours.

1334
01:11:07,950 --> 01:11:08,870
Oh, shit!

1335
01:11:10,990 --> 01:11:14,190
Can you throw- Can you throw that boomerang first before I come down?

1336
01:11:17,990 --> 01:11:19,370
Come on, get over here.

1337
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:22,950
As long as he doesn't throw the boomerang, he's pretty much useless.

1338
01:11:24,250 --> 01:11:24,930
Alright, nice.

1339
01:11:25,510 --> 01:11:27,710
Oh, there is invincibility frames!

1340
01:11:28,510 --> 01:11:29,690
I learned that now.

1341
01:11:32,690 --> 01:11:36,650
I know, like, it's sort of self-explanatory that there should be.

1342
01:11:36,970 --> 01:11:38,790
Just cause, like, it's a souls-like.

1343
01:11:39,070 --> 01:11:42,690
But, like, it felt like it did not feel like it sometimes.

1344
01:11:43,110 --> 01:11:46,270
It really did not feel like I was invincible.

1345
01:11:48,990 --> 01:11:49,510
Okay.

1346
01:11:53,370 --> 01:11:54,570
Alright, up I go.

1347
01:11:55,810 --> 01:11:56,930
I'm gonna plant another one.

1348
01:11:57,070 --> 01:11:58,730
I have a lot of seeds.

1349
01:12:01,670 --> 01:12:03,070
Go down here.

1350
01:12:04,610 --> 01:12:06,530
Jesus Christ, there's so many!

1351
01:12:07,070 --> 01:12:07,370
Oh!

1352
01:12:07,610 --> 01:12:08,190
Oh my god!

1353
01:12:08,510 --> 01:12:09,110
What a dodge!

1354
01:12:09,210 --> 01:12:10,010
Oh, it doesn't matter!

1355
01:12:10,830 --> 01:12:12,330
That's infecting matter!

1356
01:12:13,390 --> 01:12:13,710
Okay.

1357
01:12:16,850 --> 01:12:19,010
Oh, it's so hard to charge the Kamehameha.

1358
01:12:20,030 --> 01:12:21,210
Because they're all here.

1359
01:12:23,810 --> 01:12:25,930
Okay, I'm gonna get rid of the little guys first.

1360
01:12:26,810 --> 01:12:27,810
Since they...

1361
01:12:27,810 --> 01:12:29,550
They take...

1362
01:12:29,550 --> 01:12:30,510
Longer to charge up.

1363
01:12:31,110 --> 01:12:31,970
Oh, fuck!

1364
01:12:32,750 --> 01:12:33,470
Are you serious?!

1365
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:35,910
Oh!

1366
01:12:37,030 --> 01:12:39,510
I sure love my family-friendly Oshie!

1367
01:12:40,010 --> 01:12:41,890
Marco, thank you for the super chat!

1368
01:12:41,990 --> 01:12:42,890
Thank you, thank you!

1369
01:12:43,530 --> 01:12:45,770
Like, it doesn't stagger him at all!

1370
01:12:46,910 --> 01:12:48,230
Oh, this is bad.

1371
01:12:48,690 --> 01:12:49,550
It's glowing.

1372
01:12:50,330 --> 01:12:51,190
I don't think it's glowing.

1373
01:12:51,210 --> 01:12:52,490
I don't feel good when it starts glowing.

1374
01:12:56,140 --> 01:12:58,700
I don't feel so good when it starts glowing.

1375
01:12:59,080 --> 01:12:59,480
Oh!

1376
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:02,860
Oh my god, are you serious?!

1377
01:13:04,540 --> 01:13:06,220
How many arrows are there?!

1378
01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:06,600
No!

1379
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:08,680
I just rolled into it!

1380
01:13:14,210 --> 01:13:17,370
I have to do it all over again!

1381
01:13:20,890 --> 01:13:22,070
Fuck these guys.

1382
01:13:26,030 --> 01:13:26,430
Okay.

1383
01:13:26,430 --> 01:13:27,630
Okay, at least I have a shortcut.

1384
01:13:28,310 --> 01:13:28,930
I think.

1385
01:13:28,990 --> 01:13:31,030
I don't remember where this goes!

1386
01:13:32,630 --> 01:13:33,810
Where did I go?!

1387
01:13:35,410 --> 01:13:36,370
Where's the shortcut?

1388
01:13:36,550 --> 01:13:37,250
Oh, it's this way.

1389
01:13:37,450 --> 01:13:38,950
Okay, I'm just gonna run past all these guys.

1390
01:13:40,030 --> 01:13:42,030
There's no way it's gonna punish me for that.

1391
01:13:43,670 --> 01:13:44,070
Okay.

1392
01:13:51,250 --> 01:13:51,690
Okay.

1393
01:13:51,850 --> 01:13:52,150
Okay, now...

1394
01:13:52,870 --> 01:13:55,290
Now I surely won't get punished, right?

1395
01:13:55,610 --> 01:13:56,370
Oh, I can!

1396
01:13:56,890 --> 01:13:59,470
Oh my god, children, I need you to heal me right now.

1397
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:00,710
Okay.

1398
01:14:01,530 --> 01:14:02,410
This is fine.

1399
01:14:03,570 --> 01:14:05,050
This is absolutely fine.

1400
01:14:06,110 --> 01:14:07,290
Okay, and now...

1401
01:14:07,290 --> 01:14:09,470
They can't climb ladders, I remembered!

1402
01:14:10,370 --> 01:14:11,630
Oh my god, okay, we're fine.

1403
01:14:11,690 --> 01:14:12,290
We're actually fine.

1404
01:14:12,370 --> 01:14:13,230
They can't climb ladders.

1405
01:14:16,170 --> 01:14:17,530
Oh, that's so helpful.

1406
01:14:18,610 --> 01:14:20,370
And then we go this way.

1407
01:14:22,870 --> 01:14:23,350
Okay.

1408
01:14:25,450 --> 01:14:26,610
Alright, we go this way.

1409
01:14:27,290 --> 01:14:27,950
Was it this way?

1410
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:28,710
Yeah, it was.

1411
01:14:28,770 --> 01:14:29,530
Okay, it was.

1412
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:37,460
Okay, everything's fine right now.

1413
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:38,840
See, look at that!

1414
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:40,020
Not punished!

1415
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:42,200
Not punished for my crimes!

1416
01:14:46,340 --> 01:14:47,200
Okay, nice.

1417
01:14:47,420 --> 01:14:48,440
We got rid of this guy.

1418
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:50,860
Never punished, let's go!

1419
01:14:53,940 --> 01:14:55,680
That's right, I'm better at this than you.

1420
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:57,080
Alright.

1421
01:15:02,940 --> 01:15:03,220
Uh...

1422
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:05,820
Thank you for your super chat!

1423
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:06,660
Thank you, thank you!

1424
01:15:06,780 --> 01:15:08,620
I'm afraid... Wait, I'm back here.

1425
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:09,980
Wait.

1426
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:12,660
Wait a minute.

1427
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,260
I planted seed here.

1428
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:16,800
Wait a minute.

1429
01:15:21,690 --> 01:15:22,250
Um...

1430
01:15:23,290 --> 01:15:24,450
I'm confused.

1431
01:15:27,630 --> 01:15:29,190
Wait a minute.

1432
01:15:30,350 --> 01:15:32,090
This doesn't make sense.

1433
01:15:33,410 --> 01:15:34,890
Wait, where do I go?

1434
01:15:38,090 --> 01:15:39,030
Wait, what?

1435
01:15:39,330 --> 01:15:40,570
Oh, wait, no, it's here!

1436
01:15:40,930 --> 01:15:41,990
Cause he's wearing gold!

1437
01:15:42,250 --> 01:15:43,110
Why he's gold?

1438
01:15:43,710 --> 01:15:44,030
Ow!

1439
01:15:45,010 --> 01:15:45,610
Okay.

1440
01:15:47,510 --> 01:15:49,810
Yeah, I was like, I was like, I never planted that.

1441
01:15:51,490 --> 01:15:52,590
I don't remember planting.

1442
01:15:52,770 --> 01:15:53,950
That's a new path, yeah.

1443
01:15:54,510 --> 01:15:56,890
Okay, thank God that the children are still here.

1444
01:15:58,690 --> 01:15:59,750
I got a little confused.

1445
01:15:59,910 --> 01:16:01,070
I didn't see the arrow, guys.

1446
01:16:04,010 --> 01:16:05,090
I got a little silly.

1447
01:16:05,490 --> 01:16:06,570
Oh my God, he's gold.

1448
01:16:07,110 --> 01:16:08,290
Oh my God!

1449
01:16:08,490 --> 01:16:09,970
Oh, it's these guys!

1450
01:16:12,390 --> 01:16:13,690
Are you serious?

1451
01:16:14,670 --> 01:16:16,090
Get out of... Oh!

1452
01:16:17,550 --> 01:16:18,790
Guys, my pathway's gone.

1453
01:16:19,810 --> 01:16:20,890
What the...

1454
01:16:20,890 --> 01:16:23,570
Wait, it does that?

1455
01:16:24,670 --> 01:16:26,290
How am I...

1456
01:16:37,670 --> 01:16:39,470
Is it just gone forever?

1457
01:16:40,110 --> 01:16:41,550
Is it just...

1458
01:16:42,090 --> 01:16:42,790
Wait.

1459
01:16:44,430 --> 01:16:45,690
Is it just...

1460
01:16:52,710 --> 01:16:54,790
It's just...

1461
01:16:55,050 --> 01:16:56,910
Is it just gone forever?

1462
01:16:57,650 --> 01:16:58,690
Where did it go?

1463
01:17:01,970 --> 01:17:03,790
Maybe... Oh, I can recover it!

1464
01:17:03,830 --> 01:17:04,530
Oh, thank God!

1465
01:17:04,930 --> 01:17:07,550
I was like...

1466
01:17:08,410 --> 01:17:08,930
What?

1467
01:17:11,330 --> 01:17:12,650
Where's my pathway?

1468
01:17:14,010 --> 01:17:15,250
Where did it go?

1469
01:17:18,390 --> 01:17:20,110
I wonder if there's anything over there.

1470
01:17:20,330 --> 01:17:21,130
No, there isn't.

1471
01:17:21,210 --> 01:17:22,650
Oh my God, what do I do here?

1472
01:17:23,250 --> 01:17:25,410
I'm like, not okay right now.

1473
01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:29,570
There we go.

1474
01:17:30,490 --> 01:17:32,050
Why did I not insta-kill you, buddy?

1475
01:17:33,190 --> 01:17:35,730
That's literally a fucking bomb to the face.

1476
01:17:36,550 --> 01:17:38,170
I'm actually too scared to...

1477
01:17:38,170 --> 01:17:41,270
I'm too scared to, like, be aggro right now.

1478
01:17:41,310 --> 01:17:42,030
I'm like one hit.

1479
01:17:44,010 --> 01:17:45,250
I'm actually... I don't want to do this.

1480
01:17:45,350 --> 01:17:47,650
I don't want to run past these guys again.

1481
01:17:48,310 --> 01:17:49,370
I need my shortcuts.

1482
01:17:51,770 --> 01:17:54,750
I need to activate as many shortcuts as possible right now.

1483
01:17:55,890 --> 01:17:56,830
Oh, thank God!

1484
01:17:56,830 --> 01:18:00,290
I think I activated... That was a shortcut, right?

1485
01:18:01,290 --> 01:18:03,110
That had to be a shortcut to activate.

1486
01:18:03,250 --> 01:18:04,170
No, it's... Yeah.

1487
01:18:04,610 --> 01:18:05,230
No, it is.

1488
01:18:05,270 --> 01:18:06,490
Yeah, because there's a child there.

1489
01:18:07,150 --> 01:18:09,510
There's a child that I've... Oh, there's another child.

1490
01:18:09,870 --> 01:18:10,430
Oh, please.

1491
01:18:10,830 --> 01:18:11,110
Please.

1492
01:18:11,310 --> 01:18:12,410
Please give me... No!

1493
01:18:13,030 --> 01:18:13,370
No!

1494
01:18:20,290 --> 01:18:21,170
A child!

1495
01:18:23,570 --> 01:18:24,010
Alright.

1496
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:26,490
Okay, we're doing it again.

1497
01:18:27,350 --> 01:18:28,970
It's okay, I can run past everything.

1498
01:18:28,970 --> 01:18:33,210
I don't remember where that activated shortcut was, though.

1499
01:18:34,130 --> 01:18:36,410
Oh my God, where am I?

1500
01:18:37,390 --> 01:18:38,390
Was it here?

1501
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:42,900
Yes!

1502
01:18:42,900 --> 01:18:43,500
Child!

1503
01:18:43,780 --> 01:18:44,400
Yes, it is.

1504
01:18:44,460 --> 01:18:44,700
Okay.

1505
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:46,020
Get out!

1506
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:47,520
Daddy's working.

1507
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:50,540
Okay, we're here.

1508
01:18:51,020 --> 01:18:52,340
We figured it out, guys.

1509
01:18:52,980 --> 01:18:55,720
We don't have to do too... Oh, thank God.

1510
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,720
We don't have to do a lot of backtracking.

1511
01:18:58,920 --> 01:18:59,920
Thank fucking God.

1512
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:03,640
Daddy's working right now, children!

1513
01:19:04,020 --> 01:19:05,980
Oh my God, did the children run off the cliff?

1514
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:08,520
Oh my... I'm not a terrible father.

1515
01:19:09,700 --> 01:19:10,260
Wait!

1516
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:11,460
They're gone!

1517
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:16,540
Oh shit!

1518
01:19:20,060 --> 01:19:21,980
I didn't mean it, children!

1519
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:26,920
Wait!

1520
01:19:27,540 --> 01:19:31,600
They just ran off the cliff!

1521
01:19:34,140 --> 01:19:34,900
Guys!

1522
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:37,620
I didn't mean for you to run off!

1523
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:41,120
Okay, you killed them.

1524
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:41,800
No!

1525
01:19:43,100 --> 01:19:48,220
When I said get away, I didn't mean go out to the cliff!

1526
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:52,740
No, it's not me!

1527
01:19:56,530 --> 01:19:57,290
Is it?

1528
01:19:57,570 --> 01:19:58,530
Oh my God, there's so many.

1529
01:20:00,810 --> 01:20:01,370
Okay.

1530
01:20:05,390 --> 01:20:05,950
Spy.

1531
01:20:09,170 --> 01:20:09,730
What?

1532
01:20:10,190 --> 01:20:11,990
Okay, guys, they're already dead.

1533
01:20:12,270 --> 01:20:13,870
There's no need to call the CPS.

1534
01:20:14,010 --> 01:20:16,210
Like, who are they protecting when they're dead?

1535
01:20:18,390 --> 01:20:23,710
If you think about it, CPS is useless when the children are already gone.

1536
01:20:26,710 --> 01:20:29,670
Yeah, call the police instead, you're right.

1537
01:20:29,990 --> 01:20:31,070
You're right.

1538
01:20:32,690 --> 01:20:34,170
Alright, nice, we did it.

1539
01:20:34,450 --> 01:20:37,210
Okay, we should need to do...

1540
01:20:37,210 --> 01:20:37,630
Arrow.

1541
01:20:41,930 --> 01:20:42,470
Alright.

1542
01:20:42,910 --> 01:20:43,870
Oh, it's calm now.

1543
01:20:43,930 --> 01:20:44,670
It's so calm.

1544
01:20:45,550 --> 01:20:49,790
After the fucking mess that we just did there.

1545
01:20:49,790 --> 01:20:51,510
Bird, thank you for the super chat.

1546
01:20:51,590 --> 01:20:52,210
Thank you, thank you.

1547
01:20:52,310 --> 01:20:54,130
I know you finally have the croquis plush.

1548
01:20:54,430 --> 01:20:55,910
Thank you, Doki, my bird.

1549
01:20:55,970 --> 01:20:56,330
Yes!

1550
01:20:56,470 --> 01:20:57,670
Guys, you guys didn't know.

1551
01:20:58,690 --> 01:21:03,710
We have two weeks left, two weeks of the YouTube plushie, which includes croquis.

1552
01:21:03,970 --> 01:21:05,290
That's me, I'm croquis.

1553
01:21:07,350 --> 01:21:08,790
Yeah, bye now.

1554
01:21:10,350 --> 01:21:13,390
More purchases equals more opportunities in the future.

1555
01:21:17,690 --> 01:21:19,330
Okay, now we beat up the frog.

1556
01:21:20,430 --> 01:21:21,190
That's me.

1557
01:21:22,510 --> 01:21:24,630
The link is pinned in the chat.

1558
01:21:29,390 --> 01:21:30,290
So, upgrades?

1559
01:21:30,450 --> 01:21:31,250
Not yet, guys.

1560
01:21:31,490 --> 01:21:32,590
I only upgrade strength.

1561
01:21:32,910 --> 01:21:33,950
We're on the bunga build.

1562
01:21:35,730 --> 01:21:36,430
Croquet crow!

1563
01:21:36,890 --> 01:21:37,770
Oh, do you think he knows?

1564
01:21:38,010 --> 01:21:40,250
No, there's no way he didn't see me kill those kids.

1565
01:21:42,590 --> 01:21:44,070
Yeah, he doesn't know, guys.

1566
01:21:44,730 --> 01:21:45,930
It's for my other crimes.

1567
01:21:48,110 --> 01:21:50,990
Fail to teach you a lesson, so I have to do it myself.

1568
01:21:52,010 --> 01:21:56,650
After I'm done with you, I'll use your feathers to buff my armor and make it all shiny.

1569
01:21:58,910 --> 01:22:02,510
I'll be the most handsome creature under the shadow of the door.

1570
01:22:03,550 --> 01:22:04,930
Alright, squishy time!

1571
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:09,850
King of the swamp.

1572
01:22:11,050 --> 01:22:12,530
Oh my god, he's so big.

1573
01:22:12,590 --> 01:22:14,030
I am like crouch-sized.

1574
01:22:14,550 --> 01:22:15,610
Lord of his domain.

1575
01:22:15,870 --> 01:22:17,030
Ruler of all he survives.

1576
01:22:17,230 --> 01:22:18,010
Champion of the people.

1577
01:22:18,130 --> 01:22:19,630
Keeper of the five oaths.

1578
01:22:19,850 --> 01:22:20,570
First of his name.

1579
01:22:20,630 --> 01:22:21,910
Okay, I guess I'll never know.

1580
01:22:22,530 --> 01:22:23,230
Wait, what?

1581
01:22:25,950 --> 01:22:27,470
I guess I drown?

1582
01:22:28,590 --> 01:22:30,030
What the fuck?!

1583
01:22:32,890 --> 01:22:33,350
Okay.

1584
01:22:35,670 --> 01:22:36,530
Wait, what?

1585
01:22:39,940 --> 01:22:40,400
Okay.

1586
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:44,700
Okay, that does do damage.

1587
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:45,660
Okay, now I know.

1588
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:53,460
I had no idea what does damage for him for a sec.

1589
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:56,620
Okay, that's not that bad.

1590
01:22:57,080 --> 01:22:58,080
I'll just do this.

1591
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:01,060
Nice.

1592
01:23:05,370 --> 01:23:07,550
Okay, this moveset is not that scary.

1593
01:23:11,530 --> 01:23:13,230
I'll just throw bombs at him.

1594
01:23:13,930 --> 01:23:14,350
Nice!

1595
01:23:14,870 --> 01:23:15,950
Get outta here!

1596
01:23:16,830 --> 01:23:17,590
Yeah, that's right!

1597
01:23:17,690 --> 01:23:17,970
Oh!

1598
01:23:19,650 --> 01:23:20,190
Okay.

1599
01:23:21,670 --> 01:23:24,030
How much more does he- ow, fuck!

1600
01:23:24,150 --> 01:23:25,390
Okay, he bounces more now.

1601
01:23:26,190 --> 01:23:27,170
Okay, now I know.

1602
01:23:27,930 --> 01:23:29,470
Now I know, his range is further.

1603
01:23:31,130 --> 01:23:32,650
Okay, he has further range.

1604
01:23:37,690 --> 01:23:39,330
Oh, oh, oh!

1605
01:23:40,810 --> 01:23:42,370
Oh my god, the range is so far.

1606
01:23:43,270 --> 01:23:44,770
Nice, I got the other one.

1607
01:23:46,250 --> 01:23:50,790
Alright, I don't think I'm gonna win this round because like, I sort of fucked up in the beginning.

1608
01:23:51,530 --> 01:23:53,110
Oh, he's so fast.

1609
01:23:55,270 --> 01:23:56,590
Spirit Bomb!

1610
01:23:57,990 --> 01:24:00,190
But he's so fast now though.

1611
01:24:03,170 --> 01:24:04,050
Okay.

1612
01:24:07,010 --> 01:24:08,330
Alright, nice.

1613
01:24:09,790 --> 01:24:10,870
Oh, he's coming over.

1614
01:24:12,490 --> 01:24:13,030
Oh!

1615
01:24:14,270 --> 01:24:15,530
Spirit Bomb!

1616
01:24:15,530 --> 01:24:15,990
Spirit Bomb!

1617
01:24:18,250 --> 01:24:21,390
I'm trying to make sure he doesn't break up too many.

1618
01:24:21,650 --> 01:24:24,230
So I still have like, a little bit room to breathe.

1619
01:24:26,230 --> 01:24:27,130
There we go.

1620
01:24:27,630 --> 01:24:28,470
We got another one.

1621
01:24:30,570 --> 01:24:32,950
This sage is like- oh, shit!

1622
01:24:33,310 --> 01:24:34,530
What the fuck?!

1623
01:24:36,230 --> 01:24:41,690
Okay, okay, now he's- Now he's big boy.

1624
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:42,770
Oh!

1625
01:24:42,770 --> 01:24:43,130
Oh!

1626
01:24:44,530 --> 01:24:48,950
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.

1627
01:24:48,950 --> 01:24:49,590
Woah!

1628
01:24:50,050 --> 01:24:51,330
Oh my god!

1629
01:24:51,790 --> 01:24:53,350
He's so big!

1630
01:24:56,010 --> 01:24:57,930
He's so big!

1631
01:24:59,630 --> 01:25:00,850
What the-?

1632
01:25:01,270 --> 01:25:01,890
Oh, shit!

1633
01:25:02,770 --> 01:25:05,010
Oh, this is actually concerning now.

1634
01:25:05,490 --> 01:25:07,850
Oh, this is- this is so concerning.

1635
01:25:08,510 --> 01:25:11,370
Oh, and I- What the-?

1636
01:25:11,370 --> 01:25:12,550
Oh, that was an accident!

1637
01:25:14,290 --> 01:25:14,750
Oh!

1638
01:25:15,510 --> 01:25:17,130
I'm actually concerned.

1639
01:25:19,870 --> 01:25:21,030
Oh, please don't.

1640
01:25:21,070 --> 01:25:22,270
This is my only tile.

1641
01:25:23,430 --> 01:25:24,510
Oh my god!

1642
01:25:32,260 --> 01:25:33,360
Oh my god.

1643
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:34,260
Okay, now I know.

1644
01:25:35,460 --> 01:25:36,780
Now I know, guys.

1645
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:37,600
Now I know.

1646
01:25:37,780 --> 01:25:38,580
I figured it out.

1647
01:25:38,660 --> 01:25:39,680
Okay, I figured it out.

1648
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:50,180
Okay, so I cannot waste- Okay, I need not waste- I need not waste my- My bombs on- when he's big boy.

1649
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:52,840
Big boy is a little scary.

1650
01:25:54,820 --> 01:25:55,840
Now I know.

1651
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:58,600
Because, like, I need to recover my tiles.

1652
01:26:00,860 --> 01:26:02,660
And I did not have that.

1653
01:26:02,940 --> 01:26:07,620
I did not- I had no more- I had no more energy for the tiles.

1654
01:26:10,020 --> 01:26:10,400
Oh.

1655
01:26:12,980 --> 01:26:13,660
Bomb!

1656
01:26:14,180 --> 01:26:14,680
Bomb!

1657
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:18,140
These I can waste bomb on.

1658
01:26:19,180 --> 01:26:21,840
But don't waste bomb on the others, Doki.

1659
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:23,400
Kroki.

1660
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:24,040
Sorry.

1661
01:26:24,540 --> 01:26:25,400
Lapse of judgment.

1662
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:31,760
Yes, he does more.

1663
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:33,520
Okay.

1664
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:37,080
Alright.

1665
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:38,020
What am I doing?

1666
01:26:38,020 --> 01:26:39,100
Oh, I can't.

1667
01:26:39,140 --> 01:26:39,740
That was a waste.

1668
01:26:40,220 --> 01:26:41,160
Wait, did I hit him?

1669
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:43,580
What the fuck?

1670
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:45,820
Did I hit him there?

1671
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:46,880
Oh, nice.

1672
01:26:46,980 --> 01:26:47,700
I did it.

1673
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:48,160
Ooh.

1674
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:49,980
Ooh.

1675
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:52,960
Oh no, now he's big boy.

1676
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:54,540
Hello.

1677
01:26:54,780 --> 01:26:59,100
Oh my god, okay.

1678
01:26:59,680 --> 01:27:01,100
Okay, I'm not gonna waste it yet.

1679
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:02,060
Actually, no, I can.

1680
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:04,020
I'm not gonna waste it yet.

1681
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:06,380
Alright.

1682
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:07,480
Big suck.

1683
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:08,980
Big suck.

1684
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:10,660
Big suck.

1685
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:11,760
Okay.

1686
01:27:15,810 --> 01:27:16,670
Okay.

1687
01:27:17,990 --> 01:27:18,770
Nice.

1688
01:27:18,930 --> 01:27:19,570
Okay, that's good.

1689
01:27:20,210 --> 01:27:21,390
I'm not gonna waste it.

1690
01:27:21,470 --> 01:27:22,370
Don't waste the arrows.

1691
01:27:23,750 --> 01:27:24,090
Woo!

1692
01:27:24,810 --> 01:27:25,370
Woo!

1693
01:27:28,030 --> 01:27:29,750
Ah, what?!

1694
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:31,970
Ah, what?!

1695
01:27:32,890 --> 01:27:33,750
Okay!

1696
01:27:34,290 --> 01:27:35,030
Okay!

1697
01:27:35,030 --> 01:27:37,290
That was actually bullshit!

1698
01:27:39,510 --> 01:27:40,510
Oh my god!

1699
01:27:40,870 --> 01:27:41,470
Okay!

1700
01:27:42,010 --> 01:27:43,590
That's fucked up!

1701
01:27:45,810 --> 01:27:50,610
That lost two HP for no reason there.

1702
01:27:51,210 --> 01:27:54,050
That was actually fucked up.

1703
01:27:55,010 --> 01:27:57,210
Oh my god!

1704
01:27:57,870 --> 01:27:59,670
That shouldn't be a thing!

1705
01:28:05,110 --> 01:28:07,750
That's actually so cheap!

1706
01:28:08,010 --> 01:28:09,030
Holy fuck!

1707
01:28:11,070 --> 01:28:12,790
Oh my god!

1708
01:28:16,410 --> 01:28:17,570
Let's stay back here.

1709
01:28:17,810 --> 01:28:18,950
This feels like the safest.

1710
01:28:22,630 --> 01:28:23,770
I can't believe...

1711
01:28:23,770 --> 01:28:25,310
Oh my god, that actually...

1712
01:28:25,310 --> 01:28:27,110
That's actually so fucked up.

1713
01:28:31,610 --> 01:28:34,010
How was I doing?!

1714
01:28:36,490 --> 01:28:39,310
He literally spawned me into the water!

1715
01:28:44,660 --> 01:28:49,300
Like, why did it spawn me in the water?!

1716
01:28:49,300 --> 01:28:50,260
Yeah, that's right.

1717
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:53,060
Be the fat frog you are.

1718
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:55,080
Oh my god!

1719
01:28:55,740 --> 01:28:59,420
Okay, that was a little worrisome.

1720
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,080
Okay, nice.

1721
01:29:04,620 --> 01:29:04,980
Oh!

1722
01:29:04,980 --> 01:29:05,480
Oh!

1723
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:08,300
Is he gonna do any new moves or is it just that?

1724
01:29:12,060 --> 01:29:13,940
I'm not risking it.

1725
01:29:14,780 --> 01:29:16,860
I am absolutely not risking it.

1726
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:20,800
Okay, nice.

1727
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:24,080
I'm playing it slow, guys!

1728
01:29:25,700 --> 01:29:28,720
It's like the safest here and if he sucks...

1729
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:29,120
Ah!

1730
01:29:40,220 --> 01:29:40,960
No!

1731
01:29:41,860 --> 01:29:42,600
Ah!

1732
01:29:43,620 --> 01:29:44,360
No!

1733
01:29:45,100 --> 01:29:46,920
Oh no, this is bad.

1734
01:29:47,180 --> 01:29:48,920
This is actually bad, guys.

1735
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:51,040
This is so bad.

1736
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:54,540
I don't think I'm gonna kill him intact.

1737
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:59,060
Guys, I think I might die here.

1738
01:29:59,780 --> 01:30:01,600
This is bad.

1739
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:04,360
This is pretty bad.

1740
01:30:05,300 --> 01:30:06,700
I've stopped believing.

1741
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:11,160
Guys!

1742
01:30:11,980 --> 01:30:14,600
I might stop believing here.

1743
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:19,540
Okay.

1744
01:30:26,730 --> 01:30:27,160
Please!

1745
01:30:27,580 --> 01:30:30,880
How are you still so healthy?!

1746
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:33,620
How?!

1747
01:30:38,350 --> 01:30:39,950
Please don't suck here.

1748
01:30:40,250 --> 01:30:40,870
Please don't.

1749
01:30:40,970 --> 01:30:41,890
Please don't.

1750
01:30:43,330 --> 01:30:43,990
Please.

1751
01:30:44,650 --> 01:30:45,570
I have so much HP!

1752
01:30:48,570 --> 01:30:50,890
Oh my god!

1753
01:30:51,530 --> 01:30:53,950
I mean, look at him.

1754
01:30:59,690 --> 01:31:01,010
Okay.

1755
01:31:02,150 --> 01:31:02,630
Please.

1756
01:31:03,130 --> 01:31:06,230
You're still so alive?!

1757
01:31:07,390 --> 01:31:08,710
Okay.

1758
01:31:11,890 --> 01:31:13,510
Please don't suck this tile.

1759
01:31:13,770 --> 01:31:14,110
Please.

1760
01:31:14,370 --> 01:31:16,190
This is my safest tile.

1761
01:31:19,490 --> 01:31:21,690
Look at all the pink lines!

1762
01:31:23,830 --> 01:31:25,230
Oh my god.

1763
01:31:28,990 --> 01:31:30,690
I can't use the bombs.

1764
01:31:30,790 --> 01:31:32,010
I don't trust myself.

1765
01:31:38,830 --> 01:31:39,510
Jesus!

1766
01:31:39,770 --> 01:31:41,790
He's still so healthy!

1767
01:31:42,810 --> 01:31:43,330
Okay.

1768
01:31:44,030 --> 01:31:45,330
Please don't suck this tile.

1769
01:31:45,330 --> 01:31:46,150
Please.

1770
01:31:47,150 --> 01:31:50,190
This is my only tile that I trust the most.

1771
01:31:50,970 --> 01:31:55,190
Oh my god!

1772
01:31:55,270 --> 01:31:55,930
Thank god!

1773
01:31:56,770 --> 01:31:59,370
Thank fucking god.

1774
01:32:01,730 --> 01:32:02,850
The one HP.

1775
01:32:05,910 --> 01:32:06,410
Yay!

1776
01:32:08,250 --> 01:32:09,230
Our two stars!

1777
01:32:10,330 --> 01:32:10,650
Yeah!

1778
01:32:12,350 --> 01:32:13,190
Easy.

1779
01:32:13,790 --> 01:32:14,670
So easy.

1780
01:32:14,770 --> 01:32:17,070
Wasn't even worried for a second, guys.

1781
01:32:44,030 --> 01:32:46,170
Pay your last respect.

1782
01:32:46,430 --> 01:32:50,010
Why did he put so much emphasis on his rear end?

1783
01:32:51,930 --> 01:32:54,350
Goodbye, king.

1784
01:32:54,590 --> 01:32:56,010
I'm the king now!

1785
01:32:56,770 --> 01:32:57,090
Goodbye!

1786
01:32:57,090 --> 01:32:58,150
Goodbye!

1787
01:33:09,410 --> 01:33:12,330
Bro, his life was fucking shit.

1788
01:33:14,190 --> 01:33:14,650
That's right.

1789
01:33:15,310 --> 01:33:16,870
Yoink my soul now.

1790
01:33:18,430 --> 01:33:18,750
Yoki!

1791
01:33:19,290 --> 01:33:21,130
Please, pay some respect!

1792
01:33:21,870 --> 01:33:23,810
Crows don't need to pay respect.

1793
01:33:27,090 --> 01:33:28,190
Oh, I found a giant.

1794
01:33:28,330 --> 01:33:31,050
I don't want to be on the receiving end of one of these.

1795
01:33:33,410 --> 01:33:35,250
Thank you for the super chat.

1796
01:33:35,370 --> 01:33:36,170
Thank you.

1797
01:33:36,310 --> 01:33:37,170
Hello, Ms. Croaky.

1798
01:33:37,330 --> 01:33:38,370
This is Detective Smith.

1799
01:33:40,730 --> 01:33:42,330
He tripped and fell!

1800
01:33:43,210 --> 01:33:44,250
It's not my fault!

1801
01:33:45,090 --> 01:33:46,450
I found him like this.

1802
01:33:49,010 --> 01:33:50,310
He tripped and fell.

1803
01:33:50,410 --> 01:33:51,850
I think he got a heart attack.

1804
01:33:53,270 --> 01:33:54,690
I mean, look at him!

1805
01:33:55,250 --> 01:33:58,070
His cholesterol levels were so fucking high!

1806
01:34:00,330 --> 01:34:01,030
Thank you for the super chat.

1807
01:34:01,110 --> 01:34:01,850
Thank you, thank you.

1808
01:34:01,910 --> 01:34:03,070
Thank you for the super chat.

1809
01:34:03,130 --> 01:34:03,930
Thank you, thank you.

1810
01:34:04,110 --> 01:34:04,490
Thank you.

1811
01:34:08,390 --> 01:34:10,170
I think I can go from here, right?

1812
01:34:12,470 --> 01:34:13,670
It's natural causes.

1813
01:34:13,930 --> 01:34:14,710
I'm just a crow.

1814
01:34:14,870 --> 01:34:16,370
Look how tiny I am compared to him.

1815
01:34:16,770 --> 01:34:18,230
You really think I can take him down?

1816
01:34:18,450 --> 01:34:19,030
Look at me.

1817
01:34:21,410 --> 01:34:23,530
He went to the heart attack grill.

1818
01:34:23,670 --> 01:34:26,090
Yeah, he went to the heart attack restaurant.

1819
01:34:26,470 --> 01:34:30,250
That's crazy that there's a restaurant dedicated to giving people heart attacks.

1820
01:34:30,770 --> 01:34:34,390
And you have to sign a waiver for them that they're not responsible for giving you a heart attack.

1821
01:34:34,650 --> 01:34:37,830
Even though that's the entire premise of the fucking restaurant.

1822
01:34:39,550 --> 01:34:42,410
Thank you for the five gifted strips.

1823
01:34:42,530 --> 01:34:43,470
Thank you, thank you.

1824
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:49,080
Yeah, and it's perfectly legal too.

1825
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:51,100
Oh, that's the fucked up part.

1826
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:54,700
Wait, whose place is that?

1827
01:34:54,780 --> 01:34:56,200
That's somebody's new office.

1828
01:34:57,660 --> 01:34:58,060
Oh, no.

1829
01:34:58,340 --> 01:34:59,600
Okay, I need 300 more.

1830
01:35:03,350 --> 01:35:05,110
Okay, we gotta go back to the cemetery.

1831
01:35:05,610 --> 01:35:09,210
I don't remember where the pathway to that place again.

1832
01:35:09,690 --> 01:35:10,390
It's been a while.

1833
01:35:11,310 --> 01:35:14,290
I know I went the long way last time and I'm gonna do the long way again.

1834
01:35:15,150 --> 01:35:19,450
I guess I don't remember the not long way.

1835
01:35:19,450 --> 01:35:20,950
Unless it's here.

1836
01:35:21,610 --> 01:35:23,290
It's all the way down here.

1837
01:35:23,390 --> 01:35:24,670
No, that's not it.

1838
01:35:25,290 --> 01:35:28,030
I don't remember the not long way for this.

1839
01:35:31,450 --> 01:35:33,430
So I guess I'll go the long way again.

1840
01:35:33,550 --> 01:35:34,350
How strong am I?

1841
01:35:34,710 --> 01:35:36,510
Wait, I don't even one shot him?

1842
01:35:39,530 --> 01:35:40,850
I'm like so strong.

1843
01:35:41,350 --> 01:35:42,730
I put it all on strength.

1844
01:35:45,970 --> 01:35:47,450
Oh, it's going up.

1845
01:35:47,590 --> 01:35:48,850
That's... oh wait, but I have...

1846
01:35:48,850 --> 01:35:50,110
I went here for the...

1847
01:35:50,670 --> 01:35:53,130
obviously for the power up, guys.

1848
01:35:54,510 --> 01:35:56,190
Oh wait, no, it's money.

1849
01:35:58,130 --> 01:35:58,470
Okay.

1850
01:36:00,370 --> 01:36:01,730
I can finish this today.

1851
01:36:02,630 --> 01:36:05,150
I think it's like two more bosses or some shit.

1852
01:36:07,150 --> 01:36:10,730
I forgot, that's the... we gotta go to the door.

1853
01:36:10,970 --> 01:36:12,050
Which is like over here.

1854
01:36:16,740 --> 01:36:18,580
Hello, little guys.

1855
01:36:19,720 --> 01:36:20,260
Whoa.

1856
01:36:23,180 --> 01:36:24,580
Oh, get away from me.

1857
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:25,620
Don't touch me.

1858
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:27,000
Don't touch me.

1859
01:36:30,180 --> 01:36:30,960
Six feet.

1860
01:36:31,980 --> 01:36:32,900
There's the door.

1861
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:34,300
Door should be right here, right?

1862
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:36,480
Right here?

1863
01:36:39,180 --> 01:36:40,700
There's too many pathways.

1864
01:36:41,480 --> 01:36:42,770
I actually don't know where the final boss...

1865
01:36:43,100 --> 01:36:44,780
the third boss is, though.

1866
01:36:45,940 --> 01:36:46,760
Can't remember.

1867
01:36:50,160 --> 01:36:51,220
Let's see.

1868
01:36:52,900 --> 01:36:54,500
Am I going the right way?

1869
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:55,560
Children.

1870
01:36:58,970 --> 01:37:00,450
Oh yeah, there it is.

1871
01:37:00,890 --> 01:37:01,490
Yeah, I am.

1872
01:37:02,210 --> 01:37:04,410
Hello, I have more souls for you.

1873
01:37:05,890 --> 01:37:07,590
Another astounding victory.

1874
01:37:08,110 --> 01:37:11,210
I'm impressed by your courage and vigor, fledgling.

1875
01:37:11,910 --> 01:37:15,190
Once again, I reiterate, I've been stuck here for such a long time.

1876
01:37:15,610 --> 01:37:18,050
Accomplished so little in comparison to you.

1877
01:37:18,050 --> 01:37:19,790
It's been like...

1878
01:37:19,790 --> 01:37:20,370
three days.

1879
01:37:21,050 --> 01:37:22,290
And you've been stuck here for how long?

1880
01:37:23,250 --> 01:37:27,290
You have given this old crow hope for the first time in many...

1881
01:37:27,290 --> 01:37:29,370
You must be really bad at your job.

1882
01:37:29,610 --> 01:37:30,890
This took me three days.

1883
01:37:32,030 --> 01:37:35,310
Just one more giant soul, and we can open Death's Door.

1884
01:37:37,490 --> 01:37:39,030
I suggest you head west.

1885
01:37:39,170 --> 01:37:40,510
That's left side!

1886
01:37:41,810 --> 01:37:45,510
Atop the mountain, you will meet an ancient beast of untold years.

1887
01:37:45,510 --> 01:37:47,090
Okay, wait.

1888
01:37:48,390 --> 01:37:49,190
So...

1889
01:37:49,190 --> 01:37:50,270
That's left.

1890
01:37:51,650 --> 01:37:53,650
So... I just go down?

1891
01:37:54,290 --> 01:37:55,610
Wait, no, it's this way.

1892
01:37:57,230 --> 01:37:58,030
Right?

1893
01:37:59,870 --> 01:38:01,210
Is it this way?

1894
01:38:03,410 --> 01:38:04,830
Yeah, it's this way.

1895
01:38:06,490 --> 01:38:07,510
Is it?

1896
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:12,080
More left?

1897
01:38:13,300 --> 01:38:14,760
Wait, is there a secret here?

1898
01:38:15,780 --> 01:38:16,880
Any secrets?

1899
01:38:19,540 --> 01:38:20,420
No, no secrets.

1900
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:24,520
Okay, and...

1901
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:25,940
That's where the witch is.

1902
01:38:26,240 --> 01:38:28,560
So where's the...

1903
01:38:30,310 --> 01:38:32,290
So it's like this way?

1904
01:38:36,050 --> 01:38:36,360
Yeah?

1905
01:38:39,730 --> 01:38:40,930
No, that's up.

1906
01:38:41,910 --> 01:38:42,910
More left.

1907
01:38:44,270 --> 01:38:47,370
I know west is left because I'm on the left side.

1908
01:38:49,270 --> 01:38:50,310
So it should be here.

1909
01:38:50,410 --> 01:38:51,310
Oh, maybe it's this way.

1910
01:38:51,770 --> 01:38:53,070
Oh, yeah, there it is!

1911
01:38:54,750 --> 01:38:56,530
I don't think that's...

1912
01:38:56,530 --> 01:38:57,650
right, but like...

1913
01:38:57,650 --> 01:38:57,930
maybe?

1914
01:38:59,790 --> 01:39:00,450
This way.

1915
01:39:00,970 --> 01:39:02,130
The stranded sailor.

1916
01:39:03,290 --> 01:39:04,610
Does that remember west side?

1917
01:39:04,710 --> 01:39:07,150
I'm on the west coast, so I'm on the left side.

1918
01:39:10,190 --> 01:39:10,950
Oh, there we go!

1919
01:39:10,990 --> 01:39:11,590
I found it!

1920
01:39:11,690 --> 01:39:12,490
I'm so smart.

1921
01:39:12,910 --> 01:39:13,310
Wait!

1922
01:39:13,310 --> 01:39:15,070
The gods!

1923
01:39:16,090 --> 01:39:16,450
Praise be!

1924
01:39:17,450 --> 01:39:18,170
Praise be!

1925
01:39:19,310 --> 01:39:20,990
We gotta praise the bird Jesus!

1926
01:39:21,970 --> 01:39:24,150
Bird Jesus, how do I get to you?

1927
01:39:25,790 --> 01:39:26,870
Bird Jesus!

1928
01:39:27,850 --> 01:39:30,490
Don't worry, I have a power up now.

1929
01:39:31,770 --> 01:39:32,370
Boom!

1930
01:39:33,010 --> 01:39:34,230
That's five booms.

1931
01:39:34,730 --> 01:39:35,990
Oh my god, oh my god!

1932
01:39:35,990 --> 01:39:37,970
Don't mind me, I'm a big boy.

1933
01:39:40,870 --> 01:39:42,050
Wait a minute.

1934
01:39:43,110 --> 01:39:44,550
Why is he here?

1935
01:39:45,250 --> 01:39:46,150
Oh, fuck!

1936
01:39:47,430 --> 01:39:48,110
Oh, shit!

1937
01:39:48,630 --> 01:39:49,430
I got too greedy.

1938
01:39:52,030 --> 01:39:53,430
I got so greedy.

1939
01:39:56,190 --> 01:39:57,610
Please, I'm dead!

1940
01:40:01,010 --> 01:40:04,070
I just wanted to praise the bird Jesus.

1941
01:40:04,070 --> 01:40:06,370
How do I get back?

1942
01:40:07,830 --> 01:40:11,070
Oh no, I have to travel all the way back.

1943
01:40:12,950 --> 01:40:16,290
Okay, I remember how to go back.

1944
01:40:18,730 --> 01:40:23,710
Okay, look, he was so big that I just forgot how to play the game.

1945
01:40:27,210 --> 01:40:29,590
Just go left, like this way?

1946
01:40:30,930 --> 01:40:33,070
And just go this way and we'll be there.

1947
01:40:35,790 --> 01:40:36,390
Maybe?

1948
01:40:38,450 --> 01:40:39,830
I'm going left.

1949
01:40:42,670 --> 01:40:44,370
I wonder if he's like there.

1950
01:40:46,290 --> 01:40:48,170
Guys, I don't think going left works.

1951
01:40:51,680 --> 01:40:54,440
Guys, going left did not work, guys.

1952
01:40:57,730 --> 01:41:00,910
Yeah, he was so fucking huge, I just...

1953
01:41:00,910 --> 01:41:02,650
I just got stun locked.

1954
01:41:02,650 --> 01:41:04,070
Not gonna lie.

1955
01:41:04,850 --> 01:41:06,230
He like stunned me.

1956
01:41:06,390 --> 01:41:07,330
I was like, whoa!

1957
01:41:08,550 --> 01:41:10,770
Look at that fucking tank.

1958
01:41:12,530 --> 01:41:14,050
Wait, can I beat him up now?

1959
01:41:14,130 --> 01:41:14,810
Am I strong enough?

1960
01:41:16,410 --> 01:41:17,010
No.

1961
01:41:18,270 --> 01:41:20,170
I'm not strong enough.

1962
01:41:22,670 --> 01:41:23,990
Not that left?

1963
01:41:24,310 --> 01:41:29,210
Guys, you can't just say go left and then tell me it's not that left.

1964
01:41:29,210 --> 01:41:29,270
What?

1965
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:34,820
There we go.

1966
01:41:35,140 --> 01:41:36,260
Okay, I figured it out.

1967
01:41:36,720 --> 01:41:37,360
Wait, no.

1968
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:40,440
It's down here.

1969
01:41:41,060 --> 01:41:41,980
That's the witch.

1970
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:45,520
And then down here was how I got there.

1971
01:41:45,940 --> 01:41:46,460
Okay, yeah.

1972
01:41:46,740 --> 01:41:47,620
I figured it out.

1973
01:41:50,700 --> 01:41:51,680
Now I'm there.

1974
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:54,580
See guys, I figured it out.

1975
01:41:55,540 --> 01:41:56,500
It's the other left.

1976
01:41:56,540 --> 01:41:57,660
You're right, it's my other left.

1977
01:41:57,660 --> 01:41:57,980
It's okay.

1978
01:41:59,560 --> 01:42:01,400
Okay, we go this way.

1979
01:42:03,240 --> 01:42:04,300
Oh, Bird Jesus.

1980
01:42:04,940 --> 01:42:06,320
Don't worry, I know how to kill him now.

1981
01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:08,500
Not Bird Jesus, I would never.

1982
01:42:08,940 --> 01:42:09,720
That's blasphemy.

1983
01:42:10,900 --> 01:42:13,660
But the guy that's guarding Bird Jesus...

1984
01:42:14,820 --> 01:42:15,700
He's free.

1985
01:42:15,820 --> 01:42:16,760
He's free reign.

1986
01:42:21,070 --> 01:42:21,950
There you go.

1987
01:42:23,170 --> 01:42:24,570
Why is he so fast?

1988
01:42:28,840 --> 01:42:29,760
Jesus Christ.

1989
01:42:30,940 --> 01:42:33,180
Like he doesn't even care that I'm not there anymore.

1990
01:42:33,340 --> 01:42:35,780
He just wants to smash.

1991
01:42:39,860 --> 01:42:41,280
He doesn't even care.

1992
01:42:41,420 --> 01:42:42,660
He's just like, me smash.

1993
01:42:45,100 --> 01:42:46,020
Alright, nice.

1994
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:48,720
Smashing done.

1995
01:42:50,240 --> 01:42:51,560
Okay, that was a lot easier.

1996
01:42:54,120 --> 01:42:55,900
I don't know how I died at the first.

1997
01:42:56,100 --> 01:42:58,000
Guys, I got stun locked, okay?

1998
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,660
I got stun locked.

1999
01:43:03,720 --> 01:43:05,440
Hello Bird Jesus, I am here.

2000
01:43:06,280 --> 01:43:07,200
What is your wisdom?

2001
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:11,840
Yay!

2002
01:43:16,280 --> 01:43:18,260
I need to find one more shard.

2003
01:43:22,830 --> 01:43:25,330
And then we go to the next boss.

2004
01:43:26,030 --> 01:43:27,210
The wild beast.

2005
01:43:30,030 --> 01:43:31,470
Roll, roll, roll.

2006
01:43:31,470 --> 01:43:33,550
Roll, roll, roll.

2007
01:43:34,690 --> 01:43:36,350
Roll, roll, roll.

2008
01:43:37,170 --> 01:43:39,310
Roll, roll, roll.

2009
01:43:39,930 --> 01:43:41,150
We're almost there.

2010
01:43:42,070 --> 01:43:43,670
We're almost there.

2011
01:43:44,110 --> 01:43:45,810
Before we go, I have to get...

2012
01:43:45,810 --> 01:43:47,770
Croaky needs water, I'll be right back.

2013
01:44:33,540 --> 01:44:35,580
I'm waking up every time I come back.

2014
01:44:37,420 --> 01:44:41,260
It's like, Croaky needs to get water in his sleep.

2015
01:44:45,180 --> 01:44:45,560
Alright.

2016
01:44:48,540 --> 01:44:48,980
Okay,

2017
01:44:54,100 --> 01:44:55,100
off we go.

2018
01:44:55,440 --> 01:44:56,340
Oh wait, there's boxes.

2019
01:44:56,540 --> 01:44:57,940
Are there any children in here?

2020
01:44:58,380 --> 01:44:59,360
Oh, there is.

2021
01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:02,260
Don't worry, I'm here to adopt you children.

2022
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:04,420
Or you'll be used for HP.

2023
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:08,500
Alright, off we go.

2024
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:09,980
Hey, what's over here?

2025
01:45:11,540 --> 01:45:11,980
Nothing.

2026
01:45:12,220 --> 01:45:13,560
Okay, I can't do anything there yet.

2027
01:45:17,510 --> 01:45:18,030
Whoa.

2028
01:45:19,270 --> 01:45:20,690
Feels like they're gonna come alive.

2029
01:45:21,030 --> 01:45:23,190
Oh, they're like the other guards from the other area.

2030
01:45:23,310 --> 01:45:24,210
Maybe it's post-game.

2031
01:45:24,890 --> 01:45:27,230
Cause the witches guards didn't come alive.

2032
01:45:29,250 --> 01:45:29,770
Hello.

2033
01:45:30,490 --> 01:45:31,970
Wait, hey there!

2034
01:45:32,670 --> 01:45:34,730
What are you doing there, pothead?

2035
01:45:35,750 --> 01:45:37,230
Hello again, beak face.

2036
01:45:37,630 --> 01:45:38,810
How goes your adventure?

2037
01:45:39,710 --> 01:45:44,370
I'd like to stop by the Stranded Cellar to refresh my stocks of Jefferson's delicious soup.

2038
01:45:44,990 --> 01:45:47,710
He's an odd fellow, but a great chef.

2039
01:45:49,050 --> 01:45:51,090
Oh my god, what are you doing here?

2040
01:45:54,440 --> 01:45:56,820
Oh, I like the soundtrack for this one.

2041
01:45:58,180 --> 01:45:58,780
Secret?

2042
01:46:00,520 --> 01:46:01,420
What's secret?

2043
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:03,780
I got a journal.

2044
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:05,400
You found an adventure journal.

2045
01:46:05,940 --> 01:46:06,560
It's very damp.

2046
01:46:06,660 --> 01:46:08,600
The pages seem to be stuck together?

2047
01:46:09,960 --> 01:46:10,560
Hmm.

2048
01:46:11,940 --> 01:46:13,660
I'm not gonna question that.

2049
01:46:14,980 --> 01:46:15,540
Hmm.

2050
01:46:17,440 --> 01:46:18,000
Alright.

2051
01:46:19,700 --> 01:46:21,260
Where do I go?

2052
01:46:21,540 --> 01:46:23,400
Oh, I must have learned something here.

2053
01:46:23,500 --> 01:46:24,940
Cause I've seen all these anchors.

2054
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:32,220
Oh wait, there's a door!

2055
01:46:33,500 --> 01:46:34,440
Door open.

2056
01:46:36,420 --> 01:46:37,780
Oh, there's another one.

2057
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:38,960
What's this?

2058
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:41,260
The grunt's old mask.

2059
01:46:41,260 --> 01:46:43,580
It seems this grunt is loyal to a new leader now.

2060
01:46:43,640 --> 01:46:44,560
Oh, that's you!

2061
01:46:44,840 --> 01:46:46,400
Wait, that's the guy I freed!

2062
01:46:47,120 --> 01:46:47,960
It's me!

2063
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:51,240
Oh my god, it's...

2064
01:46:51,240 --> 01:46:53,400
The first...my first dragoon.

2065
01:46:53,460 --> 01:46:54,060
Right here.

2066
01:46:54,940 --> 01:46:57,400
The first dra...oh my god, I'm going...

2067
01:46:57,400 --> 01:46:58,620
I'm becoming famous.

2068
01:47:00,240 --> 01:47:01,900
Hello again, little bird.

2069
01:47:02,440 --> 01:47:04,640
Me come far and wide, see many thing.

2070
01:47:05,180 --> 01:47:06,800
World outside very beautiful.

2071
01:47:07,820 --> 01:47:09,940
Love, laugh, live.

2072
01:47:10,180 --> 01:47:11,380
The first dragoon.

2073
01:47:12,060 --> 01:47:13,420
That's all grunt want.

2074
01:47:14,820 --> 01:47:15,960
Oh my god.

2075
01:47:17,160 --> 01:47:18,780
He free man now.

2076
01:47:19,580 --> 01:47:21,320
Jefferson makes delicious soup.

2077
01:47:21,740 --> 01:47:23,960
He has dark secret not many people know.

2078
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:25,780
But grunt saw straight away.

2079
01:47:25,980 --> 01:47:27,800
Jefferson not really professional chef.

2080
01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:29,300
But grunt no care.

2081
01:47:29,860 --> 01:47:30,760
Soup is delicious.

2082
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:31,940
Oh, he don't judge.

2083
01:47:33,720 --> 01:47:34,940
Love, laugh, live.

2084
01:47:36,080 --> 01:47:36,740
The crow...

2085
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:41,640
The first crow...

2086
01:47:41,640 --> 01:47:42,060
The first crow...you're right.

2087
01:47:42,140 --> 01:47:43,360
The first crow grunt.

2088
01:47:46,620 --> 01:47:47,920
Oh, this food.

2089
01:47:50,700 --> 01:47:52,320
Greetings fellow biped.

2090
01:47:52,520 --> 01:47:55,140
Jesus Christ, what the fuck?

2091
01:48:00,520 --> 01:48:02,280
My name is Jefferson.

2092
01:48:02,540 --> 01:48:06,500
A humble bartender and seafood enthusiast at your service.

2093
01:48:07,560 --> 01:48:10,980
Could these human hands prepare you a delicious meal?

2094
01:48:11,160 --> 01:48:12,500
Yeah, that's a...

2095
01:48:13,140 --> 01:48:15,640
That's a corpse controlled by a giant squid.

2096
01:48:16,240 --> 01:48:18,580
Also, Kodiak, welcome to tomato farm.

2097
01:48:18,680 --> 01:48:19,360
Welcome, welcome.

2098
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:21,280
Great.

2099
01:48:22,160 --> 01:48:24,180
One delicious meal coming right up.

2100
01:48:25,160 --> 01:48:27,760
I sure do love preparing food with multi-digit hands.

2101
01:48:31,020 --> 01:48:32,620
Wait, is that his hand?

2102
01:48:33,180 --> 01:48:33,760
Wait a...

2103
01:48:33,760 --> 01:48:34,280
Whoa!

2104
01:48:35,280 --> 01:48:36,520
Am I eating him?

2105
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:40,060
Now tell me...

2106
01:48:40,060 --> 01:48:41,360
Wait, wait a minute.

2107
01:48:41,440 --> 01:48:42,480
Is this a fetish?

2108
01:48:46,370 --> 01:48:48,570
He's giving me his parts.

2109
01:48:50,270 --> 01:48:52,130
Wait a minute.

2110
01:48:53,090 --> 01:48:56,830
I'm not here for your sick, twisted desires.

2111
01:48:59,130 --> 01:49:02,350
The worst part is that he gave this to me for free.

2112
01:49:02,350 --> 01:49:06,010
Now tell me, is it something while you ingest nutrients?

2113
01:49:07,930 --> 01:49:09,410
That doesn't make it sound better.

2114
01:49:10,550 --> 01:49:14,370
A secret lies submerged beneath the moat in the estate of the urn witch.

2115
01:49:15,090 --> 01:49:15,530
What?

2116
01:49:16,130 --> 01:49:17,630
The moat in the estate?

2117
01:49:18,370 --> 01:49:22,090
Opening it will require bringing an open flame to the east gardens.

2118
01:49:23,790 --> 01:49:27,910
Being a powerful witch's house lies a secret accessible from the west side.

2119
01:49:28,550 --> 01:49:31,030
To find it, you must look for openings in the hedges.

2120
01:49:31,950 --> 01:49:36,350
There's a lot going on in the witch's basement even before you reach the inner furnace.

2121
01:49:37,390 --> 01:49:40,370
A stray bow carriage may grant you access to its secrets.

2122
01:49:42,290 --> 01:49:44,710
That's all I have for you for now.

2123
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:56,240
Okay, I don't think I'm gonna be accepting much soup after I...

2124
01:49:57,960 --> 01:50:01,140
Now that I know what it's made of.

2125
01:50:01,140 --> 01:50:04,960
This man like cut off his own hand for me to eat.

2126
01:50:07,260 --> 01:50:09,680
I can't do anything with the anchors yet.

2127
01:50:10,440 --> 01:50:12,480
I feel like I need a power-up for it.

2128
01:50:14,460 --> 01:50:14,720
Hello!

2129
01:50:15,580 --> 01:50:17,080
Hello there, fellow traveler.

2130
01:50:17,940 --> 01:50:19,040
Wait, it's the bard!

2131
01:50:20,080 --> 01:50:22,680
Go on, tell me how your soup is soup.

2132
01:50:23,480 --> 01:50:24,740
How's your adventure going?

2133
01:50:25,260 --> 01:50:27,580
Finding selling tales I can knock out a song about?

2134
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:33,160
Reason being, I'm up in these here mountains seeking inspiration for my next masterpiece.

2135
01:50:33,560 --> 01:50:36,360
I heard a monster lives up in the mountaintops.

2136
01:50:36,840 --> 01:50:37,800
Can you believe it?

2137
01:50:38,600 --> 01:50:42,460
That drunk fella outside that's trying to sell her said he lost his love to the beast.

2138
01:50:42,700 --> 01:50:43,760
Fancy that.

2139
01:50:44,580 --> 01:50:49,720
The way I see it, there's gotta be one heck of an epic ballad awaiting me up ahead.

2140
01:50:50,080 --> 01:50:54,340
If only I could smash up these blasted rocks blocking the path.

2141
01:50:54,440 --> 01:50:57,040
Don't worry, a hero is here now.

2142
01:50:57,720 --> 01:50:59,300
Do not worry.

2143
01:51:00,460 --> 01:51:00,780
Boom!

2144
01:51:03,080 --> 01:51:04,640
Look at that, you smashed it!

2145
01:51:05,280 --> 01:51:05,980
You're a legend!

2146
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:09,160
You might be an inspiration for my next big tune.

2147
01:51:09,700 --> 01:51:13,120
Yeah, if it's all the same to you, I might just tag along in your adventure.

2148
01:51:13,640 --> 01:51:14,760
See you around!

2149
01:51:15,540 --> 01:51:17,580
Don't no need to thank me.

2150
01:51:17,860 --> 01:51:19,980
You just gotta pay me.

2151
01:51:21,040 --> 01:51:22,740
I only take cash.

2152
01:51:23,080 --> 01:51:23,980
Ha ha ha ha ha!

2153
01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:26,940
My service- Oh, child!

2154
01:51:27,620 --> 01:51:30,120
My services do not come for free.

2155
01:51:31,420 --> 01:51:32,540
Alright, let's see.

2156
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:33,720
I'm gonna go downstairs.

2157
01:51:36,200 --> 01:51:38,120
I always get confused on where to go first.

2158
01:51:38,200 --> 01:51:40,800
I wonder if there's like, hidden stuff in the crystals.

2159
01:51:41,120 --> 01:51:42,820
Or are they just here for like, child?

2160
01:51:44,580 --> 01:51:46,840
I'm just gonna break every crystal just in case.

2161
01:51:47,120 --> 01:51:47,860
No, actually, no.

2162
01:51:47,900 --> 01:51:48,620
I have too many children.

2163
01:51:50,160 --> 01:51:51,520
I don't think I need more, right?

2164
01:51:53,980 --> 01:51:56,380
Wait, is this the correct path?

2165
01:51:58,800 --> 01:51:59,760
No, that's...

2166
01:51:59,760 --> 01:52:00,240
door.

2167
01:52:03,850 --> 01:52:04,490
Oh, wait.

2168
01:52:04,530 --> 01:52:05,970
It's the Frozen Fortress.

2169
01:52:06,430 --> 01:52:08,370
Wait, is this the correct path?

2170
01:52:08,870 --> 01:52:09,630
Or like...

2171
01:52:10,890 --> 01:52:14,090
Or is there like more... Or is it...

2172
01:52:14,090 --> 01:52:14,530
It is?

2173
01:52:14,610 --> 01:52:15,990
Okay, we gotta go this way then.

2174
01:52:17,090 --> 01:52:17,910
I'm gonna go this way.

2175
01:52:18,910 --> 01:52:20,050
Cause I didn't go right side.

2176
01:52:20,170 --> 01:52:21,870
I got... There's too many pathways.

2177
01:52:23,950 --> 01:52:24,810
Let's see.

2178
01:52:24,910 --> 01:52:25,430
Is there a secret?

2179
01:52:26,310 --> 01:52:26,790
Secret?

2180
01:52:28,150 --> 01:52:28,930
No secret?

2181
01:52:29,510 --> 01:52:30,470
Why take me here?

2182
01:52:30,550 --> 01:52:31,270
I have no secret.

2183
01:52:34,420 --> 01:52:35,620
Anything up here?

2184
01:52:37,720 --> 01:52:38,880
Any secret?

2185
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:41,520
No secret!

2186
01:52:44,860 --> 01:52:45,580
Nice.

2187
01:52:47,940 --> 01:52:49,640
And we go down here.

2188
01:52:53,500 --> 01:52:54,140
Money.

2189
01:52:55,120 --> 01:52:57,660
Okay, and then I can slam dunk here.

2190
01:52:58,260 --> 01:52:59,680
It's slam dunk time.

2191
01:53:00,100 --> 01:53:00,920
Watch this.

2192
01:53:01,400 --> 01:53:03,460
Where I go?

2193
01:53:05,920 --> 01:53:07,020
Where does this take me?

2194
01:53:11,350 --> 01:53:12,410
Where is this area?

2195
01:53:13,090 --> 01:53:14,110
Oh, Bird Jesus!

2196
01:53:15,310 --> 01:53:16,330
Hello, Bird Jesus!

2197
01:53:16,990 --> 01:53:18,170
I come for wisdom!

2198
01:53:20,570 --> 01:53:22,250
What do you have for me?

2199
01:53:22,250 --> 01:53:24,130
Oh, I should get vitality!

2200
01:53:24,250 --> 01:53:24,850
Magic, ready?

2201
01:53:27,710 --> 01:53:28,210
Yeah!

2202
01:53:29,410 --> 01:53:29,910
Magic!

2203
01:53:30,990 --> 01:53:31,730
Oh, shit.

2204
01:53:31,890 --> 01:53:32,550
Now I have five.

2205
01:53:35,370 --> 01:53:36,030
Praise be!

2206
01:53:36,990 --> 01:53:38,710
Praise be, Bird Jesus!

2207
01:53:39,270 --> 01:53:40,290
Now where am I?

2208
01:53:41,450 --> 01:53:42,110
Is it this way?

2209
01:53:42,310 --> 01:53:43,090
Oh yeah, it's this way.

2210
01:53:44,370 --> 01:53:46,030
Yeah, so that was the correct path.

2211
01:53:47,890 --> 01:53:49,410
Alright, up I go.

2212
01:53:52,250 --> 01:53:53,470
Up I go.

2213
01:53:54,290 --> 01:53:55,750
Praise be, Bird Jesus!

2214
01:53:57,450 --> 01:53:59,110
Boy, you're so generous.

2215
01:54:00,450 --> 01:54:02,550
Generous to all bird kind.

2216
01:54:06,710 --> 01:54:07,670
How is this a puzzle?

2217
01:54:09,430 --> 01:54:10,970
That is not a puzzle.

2218
01:54:17,110 --> 01:54:17,670
Cool.

2219
01:54:18,950 --> 01:54:19,450
Nice.

2220
01:54:20,510 --> 01:54:21,730
I just like hit stuff.

2221
01:54:22,970 --> 01:54:24,210
Wait, is there...

2222
01:54:24,210 --> 01:54:25,070
Can I light this?

2223
01:54:25,610 --> 01:54:26,010
No.

2224
01:54:27,810 --> 01:54:30,050
Oh, it teaches me the area's mechanics.

2225
01:54:30,270 --> 01:54:30,570
Oh!

2226
01:54:33,390 --> 01:54:35,270
Oh, I almost have 1500.

2227
01:54:36,910 --> 01:54:37,870
Hey again, pal!

2228
01:54:38,110 --> 01:54:39,710
I hope you don't mind me tagging along.

2229
01:54:39,990 --> 01:54:43,770
Seems like we'll need to find a way through this old fortress if we want to get up that mountain.

2230
01:54:44,530 --> 01:54:46,010
When I say we...

2231
01:54:46,010 --> 01:54:48,410
Wait, it's just like me for real for real.

2232
01:54:48,690 --> 01:54:50,550
When I say we, I mean you.

2233
01:54:50,930 --> 01:54:54,450
I just hang around here and work on the lyrics for our next banging tune.

2234
01:54:54,970 --> 01:54:56,350
Let me know you find a way up.

2235
01:54:56,510 --> 01:54:57,810
Oh my God, he's just like me.

2236
01:54:58,010 --> 01:54:58,790
When I say we.

2237
01:55:02,550 --> 01:55:02,990
Okay.

2238
01:55:04,090 --> 01:55:06,290
Oh, there's a lot of areas to go.

2239
01:55:06,390 --> 01:55:07,250
Oh my God.

2240
01:55:07,910 --> 01:55:09,610
Which way do I go first?

2241
01:55:10,550 --> 01:55:12,790
Oh my God, I'm overwhelmed already.

2242
01:55:14,050 --> 01:55:15,130
I'll go left side.

2243
01:55:16,850 --> 01:55:17,910
Left cause west.

2244
01:55:23,180 --> 01:55:23,620
Okay.

2245
01:55:23,620 --> 01:55:23,920
Okay.

2246
01:55:25,400 --> 01:55:27,680
I just went in a straight line.

2247
01:55:30,560 --> 01:55:31,200
Whoops.

2248
01:55:33,780 --> 01:55:35,140
Whoops, my bad.

2249
01:55:39,080 --> 01:55:40,060
Oh, okay.

2250
01:55:40,140 --> 01:55:40,780
I get it.

2251
01:55:41,220 --> 01:55:41,960
I get it.

2252
01:55:49,380 --> 01:55:51,220
Come down, and then...

2253
01:55:52,800 --> 01:55:54,060
I'm so smart.

2254
01:55:55,300 --> 01:55:58,600
Okay, that was useless.

2255
01:56:01,960 --> 01:56:04,700
I gotta figure out how to unlock that, I guess.

2256
01:56:06,140 --> 01:56:07,160
Wait, what?

2257
01:56:07,860 --> 01:56:09,180
How do I unlock it?

2258
01:56:11,860 --> 01:56:13,380
Where's the unlock button?

2259
01:56:16,680 --> 01:56:17,040
What?

2260
01:56:18,280 --> 01:56:19,600
How do I unlock?

2261
01:56:25,110 --> 01:56:25,710
Okay.

2262
01:56:26,770 --> 01:56:28,150
I'll just run around.

2263
01:56:33,030 --> 01:56:35,330
Look, it was a smart thing that I do.

2264
01:56:35,330 --> 01:56:36,270
Okay, guys.

2265
01:56:36,330 --> 01:56:38,170
I just didn't know how to unlock.

2266
01:56:40,510 --> 01:56:42,390
See, I unlocked this.

2267
01:56:44,870 --> 01:56:45,870
Smart bird.

2268
01:56:46,950 --> 01:56:47,430
Hello.

2269
01:56:49,090 --> 01:56:50,530
Oh my God, first monster.

2270
01:56:51,730 --> 01:56:52,650
Oh, fuck.

2271
01:56:52,990 --> 01:56:54,710
I'm just the first one to fight today.

2272
01:56:56,430 --> 01:56:58,190
I don't know his mechanics.

2273
01:57:00,190 --> 01:57:00,850
Boom.

2274
01:57:02,250 --> 01:57:03,570
Five booms.

2275
01:57:05,910 --> 01:57:06,350
Fire!

2276
01:57:07,070 --> 01:57:07,890
Okay, nice.

2277
01:57:08,150 --> 01:57:08,910
Oh, there's more.

2278
01:57:09,390 --> 01:57:10,290
Okay, there's more.

2279
01:57:10,370 --> 01:57:11,730
Oh, no, not the green man.

2280
01:57:11,930 --> 01:57:12,910
No, not him.

2281
01:57:13,990 --> 01:57:15,290
I need to get him out of here.

2282
01:57:15,970 --> 01:57:17,430
He needs to die first.

2283
01:57:20,510 --> 01:57:21,310
Oh, fuck.

2284
01:57:21,390 --> 01:57:21,550
Okay.

2285
01:57:22,770 --> 01:57:25,170
I'm just gonna use bomb for him.

2286
01:57:26,290 --> 01:57:27,950
I'm not getting close to that guy.

2287
01:57:29,690 --> 01:57:32,390
I realized that maybe I need to start upgrading magic.

2288
01:57:32,390 --> 01:57:33,030
Now.

2289
01:57:34,290 --> 01:57:35,170
Oh.

2290
01:57:36,270 --> 01:57:37,150
Oh.

2291
01:57:38,390 --> 01:57:40,730
After strength, I upgrade magic.

2292
01:57:42,770 --> 01:57:45,330
Because I'm just using magic for these guys.

2293
01:57:46,270 --> 01:57:47,490
Maybe I told you.

2294
01:57:48,150 --> 01:57:49,250
No, you didn't.

2295
01:57:49,990 --> 01:57:51,810
I selectively did not read it.

2296
01:57:55,220 --> 01:57:56,420
There we go.

2297
01:57:57,060 --> 01:57:57,500
Easy.

2298
01:57:57,500 --> 01:57:57,640
Easy.

2299
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:07,200
Alright, hello.

2300
01:58:07,380 --> 01:58:08,520
I'm here to free you.

2301
01:58:09,540 --> 01:58:11,520
It's so cold.

2302
01:58:12,020 --> 01:58:13,260
My bad.

2303
01:58:15,540 --> 01:58:16,880
Oh my god.

2304
01:58:17,740 --> 01:58:19,400
That's a cold ass door.

2305
01:58:25,910 --> 01:58:28,030
Maybe going all strength wasn't it, guys?

2306
01:58:30,610 --> 01:58:32,270
Who would've thought?

2307
01:58:32,870 --> 01:58:36,210
Maybe Maybe all strength is not the answer.

2308
01:58:39,480 --> 01:58:41,120
Who could've known?

2309
01:58:47,090 --> 01:58:49,090
Okay, let's do this.

2310
01:58:50,130 --> 01:58:51,550
How do I use the anchor?

2311
01:58:55,180 --> 01:58:55,780
What?

2312
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:58,720
Okay, we go up.

2313
01:59:02,530 --> 01:59:04,450
We go up.

2314
01:59:05,630 --> 01:59:06,590
Child.

2315
01:59:06,590 --> 01:59:06,730
Child.

2316
01:59:08,190 --> 01:59:09,190
Oh, wait.

2317
01:59:10,320 --> 01:59:10,690
Okay.

2318
01:59:11,770 --> 01:59:13,190
Where does this take me?

2319
01:59:15,330 --> 01:59:15,910
Hello.

2320
01:59:17,230 --> 01:59:18,230
Secret tunnel.

2321
01:59:20,910 --> 01:59:21,930
Okay, nice.

2322
01:59:22,010 --> 01:59:22,190
Money.

2323
01:59:23,050 --> 01:59:23,990
I always need that.

2324
01:59:25,590 --> 01:59:26,790
And then...

2325
01:59:26,790 --> 01:59:27,310
Child.

2326
01:59:28,950 --> 01:59:31,270
Where does this area take me to?

2327
01:59:32,330 --> 01:59:36,190
There's so many different entrances and exits.

2328
01:59:37,010 --> 01:59:37,830
Oh.

2329
01:59:38,970 --> 01:59:39,790
Okay.

2330
01:59:41,680 --> 01:59:42,650
Is that open?

2331
01:59:42,870 --> 01:59:44,230
Okay, I opened that gate.

2332
01:59:46,050 --> 01:59:47,270
Croaky learning.

2333
01:59:48,570 --> 01:59:50,550
Yeah, it's a whole fucking maze.

2334
01:59:50,950 --> 01:59:52,610
I'm not good with mazes.

2335
01:59:52,610 --> 01:59:53,670
This is...

2336
02:00:01,510 --> 02:00:03,410
Where am I?

2337
02:00:04,210 --> 02:00:05,970
Okay, that's a grave.

2338
02:00:08,190 --> 02:00:09,650
Light this up.

2339
02:00:11,830 --> 02:00:12,330
Oh?

2340
02:00:13,590 --> 02:00:15,270
That's a new thing.

2341
02:00:16,230 --> 02:00:17,570
Wait, did I miss another one?

2342
02:00:18,470 --> 02:00:19,410
Wait, where was...

2343
02:00:19,410 --> 02:00:20,870
Oh, hey, hello.

2344
02:00:38,390 --> 02:00:40,450
Oh my god, that's you.

2345
02:00:41,350 --> 02:00:42,070
Hello, sir.

2346
02:00:42,930 --> 02:00:44,250
You created my job.

2347
02:00:44,830 --> 02:00:46,470
And now I'm stuck to work.

2348
02:00:46,470 --> 02:00:48,750
And I can never die.

2349
02:00:48,990 --> 02:00:50,550
So I'm stuck to work forever.

2350
02:00:51,230 --> 02:00:52,870
So I guess...

2351
02:00:52,870 --> 02:00:53,770
Thank you?

2352
02:00:55,090 --> 02:00:56,790
No, fuck you!

2353
02:00:57,250 --> 02:00:58,230
That's right.

2354
02:00:58,790 --> 02:00:59,950
Fuck you!

2355
02:01:04,010 --> 02:01:05,250
This is the...

2356
02:01:05,250 --> 02:01:07,010
I guess I hate you.

2357
02:01:10,910 --> 02:01:13,030
This is the resting place of weed.

2358
02:01:13,030 --> 02:01:14,950
The lord of doors.

2359
02:01:15,130 --> 02:01:15,810
God!

2360
02:01:16,510 --> 02:01:17,990
I hate you!

2361
02:01:18,670 --> 02:01:21,030
You created my job!

2362
02:01:25,010 --> 02:01:29,390
I was supposed to be a free bird!

2363
02:01:29,750 --> 02:01:31,990
Now crow has to get job!

2364
02:01:36,840 --> 02:01:38,770
It's the resting place of weed.

2365
02:01:38,850 --> 02:01:40,190
The lord of doors.

2366
02:01:40,190 --> 02:01:44,190
I am lord Lockstone for whom this crypt was named.

2367
02:01:44,990 --> 02:01:46,510
We lord of doors were anomaly.

2368
02:01:47,330 --> 02:01:49,570
A mistake of the universe some might say.

2369
02:01:49,870 --> 02:01:52,550
Yeah, fuck yeah, a mistake of my life.

2370
02:01:53,730 --> 02:01:56,170
But is that not an apt description of all life?

2371
02:01:57,810 --> 02:02:00,610
A mistake of the croaky going punk now.

2372
02:02:01,270 --> 02:02:05,290
A mistake of the universe, one which grows and thrives.

2373
02:02:06,130 --> 02:02:08,330
A system was born in sick consciousness.

2374
02:02:08,330 --> 02:02:13,390
And to preserve that consciousness is the most important and noble goal.

2375
02:02:17,050 --> 02:02:19,590
He created labor laws for crows.

2376
02:02:21,130 --> 02:02:23,470
Crows never needed jobs.

2377
02:02:25,850 --> 02:02:28,190
Stupid fucking man.

2378
02:02:32,430 --> 02:02:33,750
Created corporate.

2379
02:02:35,510 --> 02:02:36,470
Okay, we go this way.

2380
02:02:42,460 --> 02:02:43,600
This is fine.

2381
02:02:45,060 --> 02:02:45,660
Nice.

2382
02:02:46,240 --> 02:02:46,980
Where'd he go?

2383
02:02:49,500 --> 02:02:50,920
Get outta here.

2384
02:02:53,080 --> 02:02:53,900
Croaky mad.

2385
02:02:54,880 --> 02:02:56,820
Croaky has to get a 9 to 5.

2386
02:02:59,800 --> 02:03:00,400
Okay.

2387
02:03:00,640 --> 02:03:02,700
Oh my god, I keep forgetting the bomb guy.

2388
02:03:06,040 --> 02:03:07,220
Jesus Christ.

2389
02:03:07,340 --> 02:03:08,220
Stupid bomb guy.

2390
02:03:10,620 --> 02:03:11,620
Okay, nice.

2391
02:03:12,460 --> 02:03:15,080
I have my own bomb!

2392
02:03:16,520 --> 02:03:18,280
That's fucking ri- oh shit!

2393
02:03:18,420 --> 02:03:18,600
Okay.

2394
02:03:20,560 --> 02:03:21,400
Whoops.

2395
02:03:23,480 --> 02:03:25,140
Oh shit, he's back.

2396
02:03:25,640 --> 02:03:27,020
Oh no, he's back.

2397
02:03:30,200 --> 02:03:31,040
Okay,

2398
02:03:34,220 --> 02:03:34,540
nice.

2399
02:03:38,010 --> 02:03:39,430
Get outta here.

2400
02:03:40,130 --> 02:03:45,750
Jesus, it took me like- Oh my god, he got too close.

2401
02:03:47,330 --> 02:03:48,130
Okay, nice.

2402
02:03:48,190 --> 02:03:48,630
He dead.

2403
02:03:51,330 --> 02:03:52,570
I'm getting better, guys.

2404
02:03:52,650 --> 02:03:53,370
See, look at that.

2405
02:03:53,930 --> 02:03:54,930
I'm getting better.

2406
02:03:56,250 --> 02:03:56,730
Hello.

2407
02:03:57,750 --> 02:03:59,610
Entombed alongside the old lords.

2408
02:04:00,090 --> 02:04:01,730
I suppose some would call it an honor.

2409
02:04:02,350 --> 02:04:03,850
I would call it a tragedy.

2410
02:04:04,730 --> 02:04:07,650
The only way to stop working is to die.

2411
02:04:09,430 --> 02:04:12,130
Truly, a sad crotale.

2412
02:04:13,060 --> 02:04:16,570
You'd never stop working until you're dead!

2413
02:04:17,330 --> 02:04:18,310
Ah!

2414
02:04:18,990 --> 02:04:24,150
What a sad tale.

2415
02:04:25,080 --> 02:04:28,910
No retirement, no benefits, no pension.

2416
02:04:33,150 --> 02:04:36,590
Let's see, we go this way.

2417
02:04:41,030 --> 02:04:42,030
And then...

2418
02:04:42,380 --> 02:04:43,710
Thank you for the super chat!

2419
02:04:44,010 --> 02:04:46,470
Chat, it's lunch time for me!

2420
02:04:46,890 --> 02:04:47,670
What do I eat?

2421
02:04:47,830 --> 02:04:48,710
Subway or burger?

2422
02:04:48,890 --> 02:04:52,350
Or could I deep-fire this funny-looking chicken on the side of my screen?

2423
02:04:52,650 --> 02:04:53,610
Thank you for the super chat!

2424
02:04:54,390 --> 02:04:55,970
I'm gonna say there's like a tomb here.

2425
02:04:57,610 --> 02:04:59,390
You should get a burger!

2426
02:04:59,990 --> 02:05:00,710
Get a burger!

2427
02:05:01,810 --> 02:05:03,110
How did I get that?

2428
02:05:06,590 --> 02:05:08,290
Is there like, any tombs?

2429
02:05:09,390 --> 02:05:11,970
Any tombs for me to light up?

2430
02:05:16,490 --> 02:05:17,730
Because there's like four!

2431
02:05:19,690 --> 02:05:20,790
I guess not here.

2432
02:05:21,190 --> 02:05:22,150
Oh, I guess not.

2433
02:05:22,290 --> 02:05:23,330
There's no tombs here.

2434
02:05:24,190 --> 02:05:25,210
Okay, I'm back here then.

2435
02:05:25,990 --> 02:05:29,250
I don't know, I thought there might be like a grave somewhere.

2436
02:05:29,370 --> 02:05:30,830
Oh, I can level up.

2437
02:05:30,930 --> 02:05:32,350
Nah, I'm gonna level up my magic, actually.

2438
02:05:34,590 --> 02:05:35,470
Actually, hmm...

2439
02:05:36,030 --> 02:05:37,190
Oh, it's so far!

2440
02:05:37,190 --> 02:05:40,610
Oh my god, why is it so far from the office?

2441
02:05:41,470 --> 02:05:42,730
Ho ho ho!

2442
02:05:43,130 --> 02:05:43,270
Hello!

2443
02:05:55,030 --> 02:05:56,350
Free crows?

2444
02:05:56,850 --> 02:05:58,450
We can do that?

2445
02:05:59,150 --> 02:06:02,750
We don't have to work outside the commission.

2446
02:06:03,190 --> 02:06:05,590
Free- that's- that's a thing!

2447
02:06:06,610 --> 02:06:07,730
Free crows?

2448
02:06:08,090 --> 02:06:09,630
Oh my god.

2449
02:06:11,350 --> 02:06:13,090
It was a choice?!

2450
02:06:13,090 --> 02:06:15,010
I can choose?!

2451
02:06:16,510 --> 02:06:17,070
Okay.

2452
02:06:19,330 --> 02:06:19,890
Um...

2453
02:06:19,890 --> 02:06:22,870
Okay, but I could max- I'm gonna max it out.

2454
02:06:23,330 --> 02:06:25,110
You know, I was like, I'm gonna max it out.

2455
02:06:25,290 --> 02:06:29,410
But look how strong- look at these bicep-septo guys!

2456
02:06:29,770 --> 02:06:31,530
Look at these abs!

2457
02:06:31,750 --> 02:06:31,950
Whoa!

2458
02:06:35,590 --> 02:06:37,090
I couldn't help it!

2459
02:06:37,330 --> 02:06:39,890
I wanted- I wanted those abs!

2460
02:06:43,950 --> 02:06:44,430
Yeah!

2461
02:06:48,070 --> 02:06:50,470
Can't believe it was a choice all along.

2462
02:06:52,310 --> 02:06:52,790
Understandable.

2463
02:06:53,210 --> 02:06:55,190
Did I say there's like extra pots to break?

2464
02:06:55,250 --> 02:06:57,230
I don't see any, because I want to break that area.

2465
02:06:59,270 --> 02:07:01,990
Yeah, there's nothing I could like break here.

2466
02:07:02,890 --> 02:07:06,310
Because I want to break- I need to use that stone, but I have no energy.

2467
02:07:06,950 --> 02:07:07,730
No energy.

2468
02:07:09,330 --> 02:07:10,050
Is it here?

2469
02:07:13,470 --> 02:07:15,610
I should reset my magic, too.

2470
02:07:17,530 --> 02:07:18,010
Honestly.

2471
02:07:21,250 --> 02:07:21,730
Uh...

2472
02:07:21,730 --> 02:07:22,510
We'll go this way.

2473
02:07:27,570 --> 02:07:28,930
Hello, is there anything here?

2474
02:07:30,590 --> 02:07:31,790
Oh, that's the doors!

2475
02:07:32,050 --> 02:07:32,390
Oh!

2476
02:07:33,270 --> 02:07:35,650
Oh, I can use this here to reset my magic, though.

2477
02:07:37,330 --> 02:07:39,910
Okay, I have a slam dunk somewhere here.

2478
02:07:42,450 --> 02:07:46,030
Okay, now I have enough energy for...

2479
02:07:46,970 --> 02:07:47,490
uh...

2480
02:07:48,810 --> 02:07:49,850
for the...

2481
02:07:49,850 --> 02:07:52,070
the little blockade back at Reaper home.

2482
02:07:55,860 --> 02:07:56,860
Door open.

2483
02:07:59,420 --> 02:08:03,620
I missed a child, but I guess he's gonna be an orphan forever.

2484
02:08:04,280 --> 02:08:04,820
Goodbye.

2485
02:08:07,900 --> 02:08:11,680
Oh, that's life.

2486
02:08:16,440 --> 02:08:19,060
This appears to be a Reaper's abandoned logbook.

2487
02:08:19,640 --> 02:08:22,960
The recent seismic event has sent upper management into a frenzy.

2488
02:08:24,140 --> 02:08:28,760
You've been ordered to scrub all mentions of it from record and close all active assignments in the region.

2489
02:08:31,140 --> 02:08:35,660
I can in good conscience let all those Reapers remain cut off from the commission and their homes.

2490
02:08:36,260 --> 02:08:39,260
I'm gonna try making my way into the vicinity, see if I can help them.

2491
02:08:39,700 --> 02:08:40,100
Aww.

2492
02:08:41,020 --> 02:08:41,780
He dead.

2493
02:08:42,640 --> 02:08:45,080
He still is now used to power up my doors.

2494
02:08:46,120 --> 02:08:47,300
I'll make it back in one piece.

2495
02:08:47,820 --> 02:08:49,900
I'll update my logs to indicate what I found.

2496
02:08:50,460 --> 02:08:52,420
There are no more entries in this journal.

2497
02:08:52,800 --> 02:08:53,860
Aww, he dead.

2498
02:08:54,780 --> 02:08:56,360
But look at this cool item I found.

2499
02:08:56,960 --> 02:08:59,980
I found a surf- Oh my god, that's the thing that's inside my body.

2500
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:01,400
Hahahaha.

2501
02:09:03,040 --> 02:09:05,420
He found a surveillance device.

2502
02:09:06,060 --> 02:09:08,480
It looks like someone has been spying on the commission.

2503
02:09:09,740 --> 02:09:13,300
Oh my god, there's my spy drone that the government installed.

2504
02:09:16,080 --> 02:09:18,480
Alright, let's go back now.

2505
02:09:22,040 --> 02:09:23,640
Todd, thank you for the super chat!

2506
02:09:23,760 --> 02:09:24,640
Thank you.

2507
02:09:28,450 --> 02:09:29,810
I'm like a snake.

2508
02:09:30,250 --> 02:09:34,950
I can- Yeah, it might be bigger than me, but it's- I'm like a snake.

2509
02:09:35,110 --> 02:09:38,270
I unhook- I un- unlock my beak.

2510
02:09:38,650 --> 02:09:39,650
And go, ahhhh.

2511
02:09:40,710 --> 02:09:41,630
Ah, ah.

2512
02:09:44,590 --> 02:09:46,370
I like the baby birds either.

2513
02:09:46,870 --> 02:09:47,870
Ah, ah.

2514
02:09:50,550 --> 02:09:52,330
Yeah, and hinge the beak.

2515
02:09:55,830 --> 02:09:56,290
Hahahaha.

2516
02:10:00,170 --> 02:10:01,810
That's how- that's how they do it.

2517
02:10:02,850 --> 02:10:05,330
Have you never seen a crow unhinge their beaks?

2518
02:10:05,610 --> 02:10:06,890
I went the wrong way.

2519
02:10:07,630 --> 02:10:08,970
Oh nice, I'm okay now.

2520
02:10:10,910 --> 02:10:14,770
Wait, how do I- Do I go faster?

2521
02:10:14,890 --> 02:10:15,390
Oh, I do.

2522
02:10:16,390 --> 02:10:18,570
I was gonna say, do I go faster than this?

2523
02:10:21,780 --> 02:10:23,240
Okay, where's the next one?

2524
02:10:23,380 --> 02:10:24,560
Oh, I have to go this way.

2525
02:10:25,660 --> 02:10:28,440
It's fine, I'm faster than the thingy.

2526
02:10:29,440 --> 02:10:30,860
I'll just use my arrow.

2527
02:10:31,260 --> 02:10:31,860
Oh shit.

2528
02:10:35,340 --> 02:10:36,580
Last one's here.

2529
02:10:39,420 --> 02:10:40,110
There you go.

2530
02:10:42,940 --> 02:10:44,240
Croaky as- What?

2531
02:10:44,980 --> 02:10:46,720
That's how baby birds eat!

2532
02:10:46,960 --> 02:10:48,520
They're like, Mom!

2533
02:10:48,800 --> 02:10:49,520
Mom!

2534
02:10:50,380 --> 02:10:53,560
And then the mom comes in and throws up in their baby mouth.

2535
02:10:53,680 --> 02:10:53,860
Blah blah.

2536
02:10:57,200 --> 02:11:00,480
It's not gross, it's just nature!

2537
02:11:01,800 --> 02:11:03,240
Uncultured goons.

2538
02:11:06,660 --> 02:11:09,140
It's literally how birds eat!

2539
02:11:10,700 --> 02:11:13,300
Can't believe you're judging my lifestyle.

2540
02:11:14,540 --> 02:11:15,840
It's fucked up.

2541
02:11:17,800 --> 02:11:19,520
I didn't know they like-

2542
02:11:22,770 --> 02:11:23,210
Okay.

2543
02:11:23,930 --> 02:11:25,310
I didn't know which part has to wait.

2544
02:11:25,510 --> 02:11:26,130
Oh my god.

2545
02:11:29,090 --> 02:11:29,530
Okay.

2546
02:11:30,370 --> 02:11:30,830
There we go.

2547
02:11:30,950 --> 02:11:31,690
Where's the last one?

2548
02:11:31,750 --> 02:11:32,390
It's all the way there.

2549
02:11:37,840 --> 02:11:47,020
It's like those children that like never we- It's like the mammal children, you know, like human kids.

2550
02:11:49,060 --> 02:11:56,160
Have you guys ever read those articles where like there's like kids that never grew up?

2551
02:12:04,960 --> 02:12:07,260
I refuse to elaborate.

2552
02:12:08,400 --> 02:12:09,740
Oh shit!

2553
02:12:09,920 --> 02:12:10,320
I'm sorry!

2554
02:12:12,860 --> 02:12:15,360
Punishment for my crimes.

2555
02:12:17,200 --> 02:12:21,460
A dragoon sent sent somebody to punish me.

2556
02:12:23,220 --> 02:12:26,060
For the crimes I've committed in this stream.

2557
02:12:30,610 --> 02:12:31,850
Oh my god.

2558
02:12:33,010 --> 02:12:34,290
Oh my god, I'm on HP.

2559
02:12:35,030 --> 02:12:35,870
Where are my children?

2560
02:12:37,750 --> 02:12:39,770
Oh, he does like two hits.

2561
02:12:39,830 --> 02:12:40,130
Okay.

2562
02:12:40,590 --> 02:12:41,430
I think I'm dead.

2563
02:12:42,390 --> 02:12:44,130
I think I might be dead.

2564
02:12:45,050 --> 02:12:45,610
Maybe.

2565
02:12:46,570 --> 02:12:48,910
Does not look ideal for me right now.

2566
02:12:53,530 --> 02:12:54,010
Okay.

2567
02:12:55,770 --> 02:12:57,830
I should be able to kill this guy really fast though.

2568
02:12:58,810 --> 02:13:00,090
No, I'm definitely dead.

2569
02:13:00,330 --> 02:13:02,030
Oh fuck!

2570
02:13:02,230 --> 02:13:02,830
Oh shit!

2571
02:13:03,930 --> 02:13:05,150
No, I'm definitely dead.

2572
02:13:07,290 --> 02:13:07,730
Oh.

2573
02:13:10,690 --> 02:13:12,230
Oh, he's just running.

2574
02:13:14,550 --> 02:13:15,070
Oh!

2575
02:13:16,730 --> 02:13:17,650
Okay, nice.

2576
02:13:21,560 --> 02:13:23,900
He does like two swings and I have to remember that.

2577
02:13:26,700 --> 02:13:27,180
Okay.

2578
02:13:28,480 --> 02:13:29,320
Is that a second swing?

2579
02:13:29,420 --> 02:13:29,840
Okay, yeah.

2580
02:13:30,120 --> 02:13:30,660
Oh, he did!

2581
02:13:30,740 --> 02:13:31,900
He tried to do a third swing!

2582
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:32,660
You freak!

2583
02:13:34,020 --> 02:13:38,200
Here lies Lord Theodore, the first successor in the lineage of lords.

2584
02:13:38,900 --> 02:13:42,380
Their transition to power was smooth, and their reign egalitarian.

2585
02:13:43,120 --> 02:13:46,460
Remember, for their fair nature, enforcing better working conditions for reapers.

2586
02:13:46,600 --> 02:13:47,860
You still made us work!

2587
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:50,540
We could be free girls!

2588
02:13:51,720 --> 02:13:54,140
What do you mean better conditions?

2589
02:13:54,580 --> 02:13:56,680
We didn't have jobs before!

2590
02:13:57,140 --> 02:14:00,960
We didn't understand the concept of money!

2591
02:14:04,680 --> 02:14:07,460
At least they unionized.

2592
02:14:09,500 --> 02:14:11,080
Alright, we go this way.

2593
02:14:12,560 --> 02:14:14,080
Oh wait, we go that way.

2594
02:14:14,300 --> 02:14:16,020
I forgot about your soul, sorry.

2595
02:14:18,020 --> 02:14:19,900
Don't worry, I got your soul.

2596
02:14:20,300 --> 02:14:24,560
My life is ending, but this lord plans to live forever.

2597
02:14:24,980 --> 02:14:26,440
Doesn't feel fair to me.

2598
02:14:27,220 --> 02:14:27,740
Goodbye.

2599
02:14:28,760 --> 02:14:29,940
Welcome to corporate.

2600
02:14:30,380 --> 02:14:31,700
Life's not fair!

2601
02:14:38,900 --> 02:14:40,120
Alright, let's...

2602
02:14:40,120 --> 02:14:40,720
Wait, is that?

2603
02:14:40,900 --> 02:14:41,920
No, that's not a pathway.

2604
02:14:42,400 --> 02:14:43,640
I had to double check.

2605
02:14:46,420 --> 02:14:47,820
How do I get over there?

2606
02:14:49,760 --> 02:14:50,280
What?

2607
02:14:53,020 --> 02:14:53,580
What?

2608
02:14:55,920 --> 02:14:57,260
How do I get over there?

2609
02:14:57,680 --> 02:14:59,520
There's clearly a pathway for it.

2610
02:15:01,060 --> 02:15:01,540
Huh?

2611
02:15:03,760 --> 02:15:04,320
Huh?

2612
02:15:08,230 --> 02:15:09,770
Oh, I can't right now.

2613
02:15:09,890 --> 02:15:10,230
Okay.

2614
02:15:11,410 --> 02:15:12,250
Confused crow.

2615
02:15:15,050 --> 02:15:16,930
Okay, I guess I won't do it then.

2616
02:15:17,850 --> 02:15:20,130
Don't have to talk to a dead boss.

2617
02:15:20,270 --> 02:15:21,130
My dead CEO.

2618
02:15:23,830 --> 02:15:24,370
Oh...

2619
02:15:24,370 --> 02:15:25,670
Where am I at?

2620
02:15:27,490 --> 02:15:28,670
Is there a child here?

2621
02:15:29,250 --> 02:15:29,790
Nice.

2622
02:15:30,150 --> 02:15:30,490
Child!

2623
02:15:31,170 --> 02:15:31,710
See?

2624
02:15:32,370 --> 02:15:33,750
You get to be adopted.

2625
02:15:37,390 --> 02:15:39,110
I can just walk around.

2626
02:15:41,130 --> 02:15:41,670
Like...

2627
02:15:41,670 --> 02:15:42,310
What the fuck?

2628
02:15:42,390 --> 02:15:43,210
How is that a threat?

2629
02:15:45,410 --> 02:15:46,410
Wait, can I swing?

2630
02:15:46,610 --> 02:15:46,910
Can I?

2631
02:15:47,970 --> 02:15:48,510
Okay.

2632
02:15:48,510 --> 02:15:48,610
Okay.

2633
02:15:49,290 --> 02:15:55,250
Look, I thought there was invincibility if I framed.

2634
02:15:56,390 --> 02:15:58,750
I thought there'd be iframes.

2635
02:15:59,150 --> 02:16:01,670
How the fuck was I supposed to know?

2636
02:16:06,620 --> 02:16:07,500
I don't know.

2637
02:16:07,880 --> 02:16:09,740
Why didn't it work this time?

2638
02:16:10,760 --> 02:16:11,800
Okay, I pick up a key.

2639
02:16:13,960 --> 02:16:16,320
I'll be like, maybe I can iframe this.

2640
02:16:17,260 --> 02:16:18,280
Clearly could not.

2641
02:16:18,280 --> 02:16:21,060
Clearly won't let me iframe this.

2642
02:16:22,900 --> 02:16:23,600
Oh, wait.

2643
02:16:27,340 --> 02:16:27,980
Okay.

2644
02:16:30,500 --> 02:16:31,500
Go this way.

2645
02:16:32,180 --> 02:16:33,440
There's two ways.

2646
02:16:34,140 --> 02:16:35,400
Where's the other door go?

2647
02:16:36,680 --> 02:16:37,780
What does this one go to?

2648
02:16:40,040 --> 02:16:40,680
What?

2649
02:16:45,060 --> 02:16:46,300
Where am I going?

2650
02:16:46,300 --> 02:16:48,280
Wait, where is this taking Croaky?

2651
02:16:55,210 --> 02:16:56,650
Long secret tunnel.

2652
02:16:57,230 --> 02:16:58,230
Oh, wait, this is...

2653
02:16:58,230 --> 02:16:59,550
Wait, no, that's just a relic.

2654
02:16:59,670 --> 02:17:00,430
No, I choose money.

2655
02:17:04,290 --> 02:17:05,250
That's just...

2656
02:17:05,250 --> 02:17:06,630
That's just a collectible.

2657
02:17:06,890 --> 02:17:07,530
I pick money.

2658
02:17:11,910 --> 02:17:14,350
Crows need to pay rent.

2659
02:17:19,270 --> 02:17:19,710
Alright.

2660
02:17:20,150 --> 02:17:21,270
Yay, rent money.

2661
02:17:23,570 --> 02:17:24,450
Okay, nice.

2662
02:17:25,990 --> 02:17:26,890
Look, I can do it.

2663
02:17:26,970 --> 02:17:27,830
I cannot do it again.

2664
02:17:27,870 --> 02:17:28,430
Oh, I can.

2665
02:17:29,870 --> 02:17:30,310
Nice.

2666
02:17:32,810 --> 02:17:36,170
Oh, I can do it again.

2667
02:17:36,310 --> 02:17:36,750
I'll say again.

2668
02:17:36,870 --> 02:17:37,050
Okay.

2669
02:17:38,370 --> 02:17:41,010
Alright, now Croaky go get a collectible.

2670
02:17:41,390 --> 02:17:42,210
Money first.

2671
02:17:45,010 --> 02:17:45,450
Exactly.

2672
02:17:45,630 --> 02:17:46,370
Of course, Croaky.

2673
02:17:46,370 --> 02:17:47,450
Money shiny.

2674
02:17:50,760 --> 02:17:52,440
Okay, then we go here.

2675
02:17:55,500 --> 02:17:56,920
Then we go here.

2676
02:17:58,760 --> 02:18:01,700
And it leads me to the area I have to go anyway.

2677
02:18:03,480 --> 02:18:04,000
Nice.

2678
02:18:05,020 --> 02:18:05,780
I got it.

2679
02:18:06,180 --> 02:18:07,440
I found an ancient crown.

2680
02:18:09,320 --> 02:18:12,240
It feels unusual to touch as it once contained life.

2681
02:18:13,400 --> 02:18:13,980
Okay, nice.

2682
02:18:15,120 --> 02:18:16,480
Alright, pick up the child.

2683
02:18:17,020 --> 02:18:17,900
Get adopted.

2684
02:18:19,460 --> 02:18:20,760
Alright, open door time.

2685
02:18:21,580 --> 02:18:23,240
Living reaper, bring me energy.

2686
02:18:23,320 --> 02:18:23,780
Wait, what?

2687
02:18:25,180 --> 02:18:26,000
Am I missing?

2688
02:18:26,940 --> 02:18:27,580
One more.

2689
02:18:27,660 --> 02:18:28,100
Oh, there.

2690
02:18:28,180 --> 02:18:28,900
I didn't see it.

2691
02:18:29,020 --> 02:18:29,920
I was missing one.

2692
02:18:30,320 --> 02:18:30,640
Whoops.

2693
02:18:33,080 --> 02:18:33,520
Alright.

2694
02:18:34,480 --> 02:18:35,140
This way.

2695
02:18:35,300 --> 02:18:36,300
I didn't go this way yet.

2696
02:18:37,480 --> 02:18:38,540
Wait, did I go this way?

2697
02:18:39,180 --> 02:18:39,940
No, I did.

2698
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:41,080
I came back from here.

2699
02:18:41,680 --> 02:18:42,300
Wait a minute.

2700
02:18:42,380 --> 02:18:43,280
I came from here.

2701
02:18:44,200 --> 02:18:46,340
Wait, but I went this way.

2702
02:18:47,140 --> 02:18:48,340
I'm confused.

2703
02:18:49,340 --> 02:18:50,320
Where do I go?

2704
02:18:52,820 --> 02:18:54,100
The right side?

2705
02:18:54,600 --> 02:18:55,480
This one?

2706
02:18:56,080 --> 02:18:57,020
Did I not go this way?

2707
02:18:57,020 --> 02:18:58,100
No, I went this way before.

2708
02:19:02,080 --> 02:19:03,400
Did I miss something?

2709
02:19:05,980 --> 02:19:07,600
Yeah, I came from here.

2710
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:11,680
Yeah, this is where I killed those people.

2711
02:19:11,680 --> 02:19:11,940
Cool.

2712
02:19:14,950 --> 02:19:16,350
Yeah.

2713
02:19:18,950 --> 02:19:21,210
Coal key lost.

2714
02:19:26,810 --> 02:19:30,450
Which way do I go?

2715
02:19:37,280 --> 02:19:39,860
Which way do I go?

2716
02:19:41,480 --> 02:19:42,720
Huh?

2717
02:19:44,560 --> 02:19:45,960
Huh?

2718
02:19:45,960 --> 02:19:46,380
Huh?

2719
02:19:47,620 --> 02:19:48,660
Got a key.

2720
02:19:49,500 --> 02:19:50,380
Where does key unlock?

2721
02:19:52,180 --> 02:19:52,820
Wait, what?

2722
02:19:52,900 --> 02:19:53,560
I got a key.

2723
02:19:54,560 --> 02:19:55,720
Oh, wait.

2724
02:19:55,900 --> 02:19:58,380
No, that's where...

2725
02:19:58,380 --> 02:20:01,680
Oh my god, where the fuck does my key open?

2726
02:20:03,940 --> 02:20:05,540
There's a locked door somewhere.

2727
02:20:07,860 --> 02:20:08,860
I have a lock.

2728
02:20:08,940 --> 02:20:09,700
Oh, there it is.

2729
02:20:09,780 --> 02:20:10,840
Oh my god, I found it.

2730
02:20:11,980 --> 02:20:13,580
Okay, I had to backtrack.

2731
02:20:13,580 --> 02:20:14,540
Bad seed.

2732
02:20:15,540 --> 02:20:17,100
Okay, I figured it out, guys.

2733
02:20:17,320 --> 02:20:19,280
This is where I killed the last guy.

2734
02:20:21,860 --> 02:20:22,340
Oh!

2735
02:20:22,840 --> 02:20:23,280
Oh!

2736
02:20:24,980 --> 02:20:25,740
Wait, what?

2737
02:20:25,840 --> 02:20:26,560
How did I kill him?

2738
02:20:29,420 --> 02:20:30,380
What happened?

2739
02:20:30,700 --> 02:20:32,180
How did I kill the other guy?

2740
02:20:33,900 --> 02:20:34,980
Oh god, not him.

2741
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:37,420
Oh, and I missed.

2742
02:20:38,440 --> 02:20:39,500
He does one more swing.

2743
02:20:41,860 --> 02:20:42,460
What?

2744
02:20:42,620 --> 02:20:43,700
I got greedy.

2745
02:20:45,440 --> 02:20:46,040
Boom!

2746
02:20:47,620 --> 02:20:49,380
I got way too greedy there.

2747
02:20:51,800 --> 02:20:54,200
Why does it still swing three times?

2748
02:20:54,400 --> 02:20:55,540
I'm so strong!

2749
02:20:56,600 --> 02:20:57,580
Look at my abs!

2750
02:20:57,760 --> 02:20:58,360
Oh, not him.

2751
02:20:58,660 --> 02:20:59,160
Not him.

2752
02:21:01,020 --> 02:21:02,000
Oh, fuck.

2753
02:21:02,460 --> 02:21:03,580
Where is he coming from?

2754
02:21:04,860 --> 02:21:05,960
Get over here!

2755
02:21:07,140 --> 02:21:07,720
No!

2756
02:21:08,700 --> 02:21:10,380
I have to kill this guy!

2757
02:21:11,900 --> 02:21:14,120
He's the scariest one of them all!

2758
02:21:15,420 --> 02:21:16,000
Nice.

2759
02:21:16,360 --> 02:21:16,860
He dead.

2760
02:21:18,160 --> 02:21:19,800
Okay, we got three crows.

2761
02:21:22,100 --> 02:21:23,540
Or four crows, don't worry.

2762
02:21:24,040 --> 02:21:24,880
I free you.

2763
02:21:25,760 --> 02:21:30,000
Posted in this fortress, I have learned a great deal about the old lord of the doors.

2764
02:21:30,620 --> 02:21:32,040
Still don't much care for them.

2765
02:21:33,780 --> 02:21:35,360
We should've started a union.

2766
02:21:36,720 --> 02:21:38,400
Rise up, crows!

2767
02:21:38,740 --> 02:21:40,600
We gotta unionize!

2768
02:21:45,430 --> 02:21:45,950
Okay.

2769
02:21:49,870 --> 02:21:51,090
Go home now?

2770
02:21:51,370 --> 02:21:52,010
Yeah, we can.

2771
02:21:54,670 --> 02:21:56,710
And then I eat my children.

2772
02:21:58,250 --> 02:21:59,730
And then we go home.

2773
02:21:59,990 --> 02:22:01,470
We go all the way back.

2774
02:22:01,530 --> 02:22:02,210
How much do I have?

2775
02:22:02,270 --> 02:22:02,830
Okay, 400.

2776
02:22:02,830 --> 02:22:06,610
I need 200 more for upgrades.

2777
02:22:07,530 --> 02:22:08,170
It's this way.

2778
02:22:08,850 --> 02:22:09,870
I remember it's this way.

2779
02:22:11,690 --> 02:22:14,030
We gotta unionize!

2780
02:22:14,410 --> 02:22:16,990
We gotta become free crows again!

2781
02:22:18,670 --> 02:22:20,270
I don't need to be careful.

2782
02:22:24,350 --> 02:22:26,430
I don't need to be careful.

2783
02:22:27,770 --> 02:22:29,050
I consent!

2784
02:22:34,370 --> 02:22:37,290
I don't even think we have healthcare insurance here.

2785
02:22:45,450 --> 02:22:46,810
Alright, here we go.

2786
02:22:51,770 --> 02:22:52,410
Avarice.

2787
02:22:52,810 --> 02:22:54,130
Wait, there's fire now?

2788
02:22:54,270 --> 02:22:54,690
Woah!

2789
02:22:59,930 --> 02:23:01,590
I didn't see him!

2790
02:23:02,030 --> 02:23:03,370
It's so dark!

2791
02:23:04,770 --> 02:23:06,190
Oh my god, they're too close.

2792
02:23:08,470 --> 02:23:09,830
They're just running.

2793
02:23:11,590 --> 02:23:12,650
Okay, nice.

2794
02:23:14,490 --> 02:23:16,470
Okay, I need to get this guy out of here.

2795
02:23:19,230 --> 02:23:20,290
Okay, nice.

2796
02:23:22,710 --> 02:23:25,510
I don't have time to use the heavy attacks!

2797
02:23:26,070 --> 02:23:26,130
Ah!

2798
02:23:26,390 --> 02:23:27,030
Fuck!

2799
02:23:28,490 --> 02:23:31,130
I can only use like the small attacks.

2800
02:23:32,690 --> 02:23:34,650
Because they move too fast!

2801
02:23:36,130 --> 02:23:37,590
It's not fair!

2802
02:23:41,470 --> 02:23:42,270
Okay, nice.

2803
02:23:43,110 --> 02:23:43,950
We got what?

2804
02:23:44,010 --> 02:23:44,770
Two flames.

2805
02:23:45,650 --> 02:23:47,170
Oh no, not these guys.

2806
02:23:47,810 --> 02:23:49,030
Not these guys.

2807
02:23:52,470 --> 02:23:54,070
Okay, okay.

2808
02:24:05,740 --> 02:24:08,300
Oh my god, try to hit the jar!

2809
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:13,100
Okay, this is it.

2810
02:24:13,760 --> 02:24:15,600
Oh my god!

2811
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:17,720
I'm just gonna use my hands.

2812
02:24:20,540 --> 02:24:21,780
That's awkward.

2813
02:24:25,160 --> 02:24:27,040
Oh my god, it's him!

2814
02:24:30,220 --> 02:24:32,460
Oh my god!

2815
02:24:33,220 --> 02:24:36,260
Bro, he's so scary!

2816
02:24:37,740 --> 02:24:39,540
He's so big!

2817
02:24:40,020 --> 02:24:40,360
Oh!

2818
02:24:44,030 --> 02:24:47,010
He's so scary, I don't wanna get close to him.

2819
02:24:48,170 --> 02:24:49,490
Oh thank god!

2820
02:24:49,910 --> 02:24:51,190
Oh thank god!

2821
02:24:53,250 --> 02:24:55,330
He's the scariest of them all.

2822
02:24:56,510 --> 02:24:59,130
Okay, now I should have the anchor ability now.

2823
02:25:00,790 --> 02:25:01,990
Crow Jesus!

2824
02:25:03,650 --> 02:25:04,990
Crow God!

2825
02:25:05,250 --> 02:25:05,950
Praise be!

2826
02:25:06,870 --> 02:25:09,850
I give to a fellow crow to aid you on your quest.

2827
02:25:09,970 --> 02:25:10,650
Crow God!

2828
02:25:13,550 --> 02:25:14,910
Praise be!

2829
02:25:21,330 --> 02:25:23,230
Lord of the crows.

2830
02:25:24,770 --> 02:25:26,610
Oh my god, I'm royalty now.

2831
02:25:26,610 --> 02:25:27,670
See that crown?

2832
02:25:28,530 --> 02:25:30,510
The hookshot, press to use it.

2833
02:25:30,610 --> 02:25:31,590
How much does it use?

2834
02:25:32,610 --> 02:25:33,450
Oh my gosh!

2835
02:25:34,350 --> 02:25:35,550
Now I'm royalty!

2836
02:25:36,450 --> 02:25:37,430
Praise be!

2837
02:25:38,190 --> 02:25:38,770
Crow God!

2838
02:25:39,430 --> 02:25:41,570
You granted me royal blood.

2839
02:25:42,410 --> 02:25:42,990
Oops.

2840
02:25:43,730 --> 02:25:47,470
Okay, I was scared that I was gonna fuck it up again.

2841
02:25:47,570 --> 02:25:49,010
Oh, I can use it for the lamp!

2842
02:25:50,630 --> 02:25:51,210
Oh!

2843
02:25:52,810 --> 02:25:54,650
Wait, it doesn't use any abilities.

2844
02:25:56,610 --> 02:25:57,030
Nice.

2845
02:25:58,630 --> 02:25:59,810
I didn't read the journal.

2846
02:25:59,950 --> 02:26:01,950
Oh wait, I can go upstairs again.

2847
02:26:02,570 --> 02:26:03,770
What does the journal say?

2848
02:26:26,670 --> 02:26:28,610
They're getting too close to the truth!

2849
02:26:48,350 --> 02:26:50,150
They get crazy!

2850
02:26:50,530 --> 02:26:51,590
They get a little cuckoo!

2851
02:26:51,590 --> 02:26:52,170
Oh!

2852
02:26:56,760 --> 02:26:57,420
Ooh!

2853
02:26:58,320 --> 02:27:01,040
I'm glad that this doesn't take like...

2854
02:27:01,040 --> 02:27:02,300
extra...

2855
02:27:03,320 --> 02:27:05,940
Doesn't take extra magic points to...

2856
02:27:05,940 --> 02:27:06,760
Hey, there's a phone!

2857
02:27:07,600 --> 02:27:08,260
Ring ring!

2858
02:27:09,120 --> 02:27:11,340
Oh wait, this is where I started!

2859
02:27:12,200 --> 02:27:14,060
Look at that, the dwarves propaganda.

2860
02:27:15,620 --> 02:27:19,760
The corporate propaganda to make me feel like a happy worker.

2861
02:27:21,280 --> 02:27:25,380
That Vaga reckons that something big's gonna happen here soon.

2862
02:27:25,840 --> 02:27:27,000
You know anything about that, buddy?

2863
02:27:27,460 --> 02:27:28,640
No, I'm just a crow.

2864
02:27:30,460 --> 02:27:30,940
Okay.

2865
02:27:31,820 --> 02:27:32,700
Oh, hello kids.

2866
02:27:34,200 --> 02:27:35,780
I don't know why anyone was complaining.

2867
02:27:36,140 --> 02:27:39,120
These things are adorable and they like the same TV shows as me.

2868
02:27:39,120 --> 02:27:39,840
Oh, look at that!

2869
02:27:39,900 --> 02:27:40,380
They're sleeping!

2870
02:27:40,940 --> 02:27:41,500
Wake up!

2871
02:27:45,560 --> 02:27:46,520
Corporate propaganda.

2872
02:27:47,600 --> 02:27:49,840
I'm just relaxing, feeding the birds.

2873
02:27:50,360 --> 02:27:52,340
But none of my friends want to eat off the floor.

2874
02:27:54,460 --> 02:27:57,100
You get to pick to be a free bird.

2875
02:27:57,480 --> 02:27:58,600
This is fucked up.

2876
02:27:59,340 --> 02:28:00,440
Why can't I pick?

2877
02:28:00,680 --> 02:28:01,580
Wait, not this way.

2878
02:28:05,260 --> 02:28:07,020
Okay, I need to...

2879
02:28:07,720 --> 02:28:08,440
Do I have enough?

2880
02:28:08,720 --> 02:28:11,620
I need nine points.

2881
02:28:11,920 --> 02:28:12,480
Wait!

2882
02:28:14,600 --> 02:28:15,160
What?

2883
02:28:15,560 --> 02:28:17,280
Why is it black now?

2884
02:28:17,740 --> 02:28:18,640
What did you...

2885
02:28:19,340 --> 02:28:21,180
What did you do to it?

2886
02:28:22,400 --> 02:28:22,880
Oh!

2887
02:28:23,220 --> 02:28:24,520
He got in the ink supply.

2888
02:28:24,960 --> 02:28:25,920
The poor deer.

2889
02:28:26,420 --> 02:28:27,960
Although she doesn't seem to mind.

2890
02:28:28,500 --> 02:28:31,380
Maybe she just loves the smell of ink as much as I do.

2891
02:28:31,440 --> 02:28:32,940
I was like, it changes color?

2892
02:28:33,860 --> 02:28:35,140
I was like, wow!

2893
02:28:35,300 --> 02:28:36,320
You can do that?

2894
02:28:37,240 --> 02:28:38,440
Change color now.

2895
02:28:40,080 --> 02:28:40,940
Change color.

2896
02:28:43,640 --> 02:28:45,040
I was like, what the fuck?

2897
02:28:48,670 --> 02:28:49,770
A thing?

2898
02:28:51,430 --> 02:28:52,670
Oh my god!

2899
02:28:52,830 --> 02:28:53,850
Oh no!

2900
02:28:54,090 --> 02:28:55,590
It got into the supply!

2901
02:28:58,730 --> 02:29:01,190
I don't remember where that needs anchors.

2902
02:29:01,810 --> 02:29:03,270
I don't remember.

2903
02:29:03,910 --> 02:29:05,090
I don't remember.

2904
02:29:06,930 --> 02:29:08,630
I'm trying to think.

2905
02:29:08,970 --> 02:29:10,350
Wait, we gotta get money first.

2906
02:29:11,090 --> 02:29:12,490
Oh my god, there's so many backtracks.

2907
02:29:12,530 --> 02:29:13,610
I'm not backtracking, guys.

2908
02:29:13,610 --> 02:29:20,830
I remember there's like a lot of areas that have anchors in the other areas, but we're not backtracking.

2909
02:29:23,390 --> 02:29:25,990
And we need to go this way.

2910
02:29:32,200 --> 02:29:34,080
And then this way.

2911
02:29:35,140 --> 02:29:36,560
There's an anchor here.

2912
02:29:36,820 --> 02:29:38,500
There's a tomb here with the anchors.

2913
02:29:38,500 --> 02:29:40,500
What is this?

2914
02:29:45,620 --> 02:29:46,820
I lied.

2915
02:29:47,080 --> 02:29:48,260
This was not it.

2916
02:29:48,720 --> 02:29:50,500
I backtracked here for no reason.

2917
02:29:51,380 --> 02:29:52,600
God fucking- Okay.

2918
02:29:57,100 --> 02:29:59,880
I went all the way here for no reason.

2919
02:30:00,120 --> 02:30:01,360
God damn it, okay.

2920
02:30:05,070 --> 02:30:06,710
Okay, it's this way.

2921
02:30:07,570 --> 02:30:12,690
And then, was there a back- There's this- Were there anchors here, right?

2922
02:30:14,030 --> 02:30:14,930
Oh yeah, there was.

2923
02:30:14,990 --> 02:30:16,330
Okay, I figured it out.

2924
02:30:17,470 --> 02:30:18,830
That's where the anchors were.

2925
02:30:20,690 --> 02:30:22,170
These are so many.

2926
02:30:22,790 --> 02:30:24,650
There's no mini-map.

2927
02:30:24,970 --> 02:30:25,310
Okay?

2928
02:30:25,750 --> 02:30:27,350
I have to rely on my- Ah!

2929
02:30:28,650 --> 02:30:29,250
Shit.

2930
02:30:29,690 --> 02:30:30,110
Okay.

2931
02:30:31,250 --> 02:30:32,810
There's no mini-map.

2932
02:30:33,050 --> 02:30:34,730
I have to use my crow brain.

2933
02:30:34,730 --> 02:30:38,070
Crows have an IQ of a nine-year-old.

2934
02:30:38,330 --> 02:30:41,310
Nine-year-olds don't remember things like these.

2935
02:30:44,550 --> 02:30:46,170
What do I do with this key?

2936
02:30:47,650 --> 02:30:49,150
I have an extra key.

2937
02:30:50,930 --> 02:30:53,430
Why do nine-year-olds have to remember this?

2938
02:30:57,090 --> 02:30:58,970
Are there any extra anchors here?

2939
02:31:01,230 --> 02:31:03,130
Maybe extra anchors here.

2940
02:31:04,090 --> 02:31:04,770
Alright.

2941
02:31:04,970 --> 02:31:06,470
Get away, children!

2942
02:31:08,090 --> 02:31:08,990
Okay, no.

2943
02:31:09,090 --> 02:31:09,630
Not here.

2944
02:31:10,010 --> 02:31:11,470
That's my dead crow friend.

2945
02:31:12,450 --> 02:31:13,850
Get away, kids.

2946
02:31:15,310 --> 02:31:17,850
Daddy's trying to fucking think right now.

2947
02:31:18,430 --> 02:31:20,310
And it's not working so well.

2948
02:31:21,950 --> 02:31:23,170
Oh, there you go.

2949
02:31:25,310 --> 02:31:26,770
Okay, I figured it out.

2950
02:31:30,600 --> 02:31:31,220
Huh?

2951
02:31:34,320 --> 02:31:35,000
Okay.

2952
02:31:37,480 --> 02:31:38,040
Why...

2953
02:31:38,040 --> 02:31:39,980
Why is there one over here?

2954
02:31:41,900 --> 02:31:44,360
I'm confused why there's one randomly here.

2955
02:31:44,920 --> 02:31:46,300
Oh, there's how I got the money.

2956
02:31:47,040 --> 02:31:48,700
How do I...huh.

2957
02:31:50,780 --> 02:31:52,420
How do I get over here?

2958
02:31:54,280 --> 02:31:55,760
Okay, we found money.

2959
02:31:57,680 --> 02:31:59,440
Like, why is there one here?

2960
02:32:01,060 --> 02:32:03,480
When I could just grapple this.

2961
02:32:07,410 --> 02:32:10,270
Okay, we don't...we did that.

2962
02:32:13,730 --> 02:32:15,790
Oh my god, where else do I have to go?

2963
02:32:16,950 --> 02:32:17,970
Where else?

2964
02:32:21,250 --> 02:32:22,590
I don't know.

2965
02:32:23,930 --> 02:32:25,210
I don't know.

2966
02:32:27,910 --> 02:32:29,170
Oh, there, there, there!

2967
02:32:30,730 --> 02:32:31,990
Okay, I know.

2968
02:32:32,610 --> 02:32:33,910
I know now.

2969
02:32:35,050 --> 02:32:36,950
And then I open door.

2970
02:32:36,950 --> 02:32:39,050
Okay.

2971
02:32:39,050 --> 02:32:39,850
And then it opens.

2972
02:32:40,410 --> 02:32:41,610
Okay, it does a ladder.

2973
02:32:43,090 --> 02:32:44,150
Okay.

2974
02:32:44,930 --> 02:32:45,990
I know now.

2975
02:32:48,380 --> 02:32:49,600
What?

2976
02:32:51,950 --> 02:32:53,230
What?

2977
02:32:54,270 --> 02:32:54,930
What?

2978
02:32:55,570 --> 02:32:57,990
I am at appropriate height!

2979
02:32:59,350 --> 02:33:00,510
Excuse me!

2980
02:33:07,440 --> 02:33:08,220
Huh?

2981
02:33:08,900 --> 02:33:09,640
Oh.

2982
02:33:13,240 --> 02:33:15,760
Now I'm at appropriate height!

2983
02:33:17,780 --> 02:33:18,640
Okay.

2984
02:33:19,140 --> 02:33:20,540
I figured it out.

2985
02:33:21,460 --> 02:33:23,940
I'm at appropriate height now.

2986
02:33:25,340 --> 02:33:27,280
Okay, I need to think about this.

2987
02:33:27,560 --> 02:33:28,000
Okay.

2988
02:33:30,560 --> 02:33:32,060
Did I do that?

2989
02:33:34,280 --> 02:33:35,140
What?

2990
02:33:36,440 --> 02:33:37,560
What?

2991
02:33:37,720 --> 02:33:39,200
What is appropriate height?

2992
02:33:41,300 --> 02:33:42,740
I'm at appropriate height?

2993
02:33:43,060 --> 02:33:43,720
Okay, here.

2994
02:33:45,060 --> 02:33:46,560
What did I do?

2995
02:33:48,360 --> 02:33:48,920
Oh!

2996
02:33:54,230 --> 02:33:54,810
Okay.

2997
02:33:58,670 --> 02:34:03,150
And then...

2998
02:34:03,150 --> 02:34:03,690
Ah.

2999
02:34:06,530 --> 02:34:07,650
Ah.

3000
02:34:10,470 --> 02:34:10,630
Ah.

3001
02:34:12,230 --> 02:34:12,650
Um.

3002
02:34:28,200 --> 02:34:30,080
I can't hit that.

3003
02:34:42,740 --> 02:34:43,480
Ah.

3004
02:34:46,420 --> 02:34:47,760
Okay, think.

3005
02:34:57,080 --> 02:34:57,940
Okay, smart.

3006
02:34:59,740 --> 02:35:00,940
So smart.

3007
02:35:06,030 --> 02:35:07,690
I have to do this again.

3008
02:35:08,970 --> 02:35:10,270
And then...

3009
02:35:10,270 --> 02:35:13,590
Oh my god, my brain is so smart.

3010
02:35:13,590 --> 02:35:16,090
The smartest nine-year-old out there.

3011
02:35:18,150 --> 02:35:19,330
Open door.

3012
02:35:21,550 --> 02:35:24,890
The smartest nine-year-old bird out there.

3013
02:35:26,370 --> 02:35:27,290
What's this?

3014
02:35:29,550 --> 02:35:31,830
Wait, I could've gone this way this entire...

3015
02:35:31,830 --> 02:35:32,330
Wait, no.

3016
02:35:32,430 --> 02:35:33,010
This is different.

3017
02:35:34,490 --> 02:35:35,530
This is different.

3018
02:35:35,990 --> 02:35:36,290
Yeah.

3019
02:35:39,340 --> 02:35:40,080
Speed!

3020
02:35:41,920 --> 02:35:42,660
Speed!

3021
02:35:42,660 --> 02:35:43,820
Okay, there.

3022
02:35:45,040 --> 02:35:46,000
Where does this take me?

3023
02:35:46,220 --> 02:35:47,280
Ah, another grave!

3024
02:35:48,440 --> 02:35:49,640
I don't wanna read this.

3025
02:36:04,020 --> 02:36:08,420
Wait, but that...

3026
02:36:08,420 --> 02:36:09,900
That fucks with my job!

3027
02:36:09,900 --> 02:36:14,380
Why would you extend life when my whole job is to delete life?

3028
02:36:18,010 --> 02:36:19,530
That doesn't make sense!

3029
02:36:26,030 --> 02:36:29,030
What's the point of my job if you're just gonna extend life?

3030
02:36:29,890 --> 02:36:31,110
Fuck you!

3031
02:36:31,390 --> 02:36:36,270
Oh, your life was not easy!

3032
02:36:36,810 --> 02:36:38,130
I live forever!

3033
02:36:38,450 --> 02:36:39,990
At least you get to die!

3034
02:36:39,990 --> 02:36:40,590
Die!

3035
02:36:43,150 --> 02:36:47,070
The balance of the universe was my duty and mine alone.

3036
02:36:47,890 --> 02:36:51,170
The lord who created me had grand illusions about fate and purpose.

3037
02:36:51,870 --> 02:36:53,710
But fate did not buy me the death's door.

3038
02:36:53,890 --> 02:36:54,470
Title drop.

3039
02:36:54,810 --> 02:36:55,510
Duty did.

3040
02:36:57,070 --> 02:37:01,510
No other could take... It's like when the CEO of...

3041
02:37:02,170 --> 02:37:13,290
The CEO of a retailer or a superstore or whatever and they're like telling it to their workers at the stores.

3042
02:37:13,510 --> 02:37:15,410
You think you have it bad?

3043
02:37:15,550 --> 02:37:21,650
I gotta make financial decisions for that company as this person is working their fifth job right now of the day.

3044
02:37:24,750 --> 02:37:27,370
Controlling life and death so I bore the burden.

3045
02:37:28,130 --> 02:37:34,450
I bore it for as long as I could even extending my life beyond the bounds set by pitiful anarchism that is death.

3046
02:37:35,070 --> 02:37:36,870
My time finally drew to a close.

3047
02:37:37,310 --> 02:37:39,750
My successor paid no heed to my teachings.

3048
02:37:40,470 --> 02:37:44,230
I fear their reign may have destroyed the balance I tried so hard to maintain.

3049
02:37:45,390 --> 02:37:47,130
What a bitter disappointment they have been.

3050
02:37:47,890 --> 02:37:49,410
Greatness is seldom free, crow.

3051
02:37:50,130 --> 02:37:52,510
True greatness may even cost you your soul.

3052
02:37:53,670 --> 02:37:55,530
You get to die!

3053
02:37:56,810 --> 02:37:59,390
I have to work this job forever!

3054
02:38:01,510 --> 02:38:02,090
Hello.

3055
02:38:02,790 --> 02:38:03,450
Where am I?

3056
02:38:04,310 --> 02:38:06,030
Wait, I don't think I ever went this way.

3057
02:38:07,410 --> 02:38:07,930
Secret!

3058
02:38:13,070 --> 02:38:14,290
And I went this way.

3059
02:38:14,690 --> 02:38:15,930
There's like a hidden door.

3060
02:38:19,550 --> 02:38:23,330
Oh, it's just fucking collectible.

3061
02:38:23,630 --> 02:38:25,330
You found some kind of signed contract?

3062
02:38:26,070 --> 02:38:26,690
How exciting!

3063
02:38:28,670 --> 02:38:29,190
Sure.

3064
02:38:31,150 --> 02:38:33,510
That's what they all say about contracts.

3065
02:38:36,330 --> 02:38:37,150
That's it?

3066
02:38:37,590 --> 02:38:38,070
Huh.

3067
02:38:38,350 --> 02:38:39,890
Thought I'd get something more out of that.

3068
02:38:39,970 --> 02:38:41,950
Thought I'd be praying that birds use this again.

3069
02:38:43,330 --> 02:38:44,710
Oh boy, I'm on DA.

3070
02:38:47,430 --> 02:38:48,570
Oh, there's the door.

3071
02:38:50,790 --> 02:38:51,270
Oh,

3072
02:38:55,120 --> 02:38:56,100
that's where it takes me.

3073
02:38:57,220 --> 02:38:57,620
Okay.

3074
02:38:57,940 --> 02:38:58,700
Do I have 600 now?

3075
02:38:58,740 --> 02:38:59,300
Oh, I do!

3076
02:39:00,120 --> 02:39:01,940
My magic can be a little stronger now.

3077
02:39:09,290 --> 02:39:09,930
Uh...

3078
02:39:09,930 --> 02:39:12,250
Please upgrade my magic, sir.

3079
02:39:16,910 --> 02:39:17,550
Yes.

3080
02:39:18,810 --> 02:39:21,150
I would like to upgrade my magic.

3081
02:39:21,830 --> 02:39:22,770
Strengthen magic.

3082
02:39:24,930 --> 02:39:26,650
Think I can, guys.

3083
02:39:26,830 --> 02:39:32,110
If I could, I would have most definitely put in more strength, guys.

3084
02:39:32,150 --> 02:39:32,990
You know I would.

3085
02:39:33,570 --> 02:39:35,310
I want an 8-pack.

3086
02:39:35,310 --> 02:39:35,350
8-pack.

3087
02:39:38,270 --> 02:39:38,930
Oh, shit.

3088
02:39:39,130 --> 02:39:39,550
Wrong area.

3089
02:39:40,390 --> 02:39:41,790
If I could, I would put more.

3090
02:39:48,870 --> 02:39:49,270
Alright.

3091
02:39:49,950 --> 02:39:50,890
Up I go.

3092
02:39:52,410 --> 02:39:53,590
Was it this way?

3093
02:39:53,670 --> 02:39:54,210
Oh yeah, it was.

3094
02:39:54,290 --> 02:39:54,830
There's the ladder.

3095
02:39:56,670 --> 02:39:58,570
Yeah, now I get bronze and brains.

3096
02:39:58,770 --> 02:39:59,110
Whoa!

3097
02:40:02,050 --> 02:40:03,930
That's like seeing a crow climb up the ladder.

3098
02:40:04,230 --> 02:40:05,150
It's so silly.

3099
02:40:06,190 --> 02:40:07,230
The way he climbs up.

3100
02:40:07,550 --> 02:40:08,570
Such a silly guy.

3101
02:40:09,510 --> 02:40:10,810
Why'd he, like, reset it?

3102
02:40:11,110 --> 02:40:12,030
I have to do this again.

3103
02:40:15,910 --> 02:40:18,250
I like how the range is really far, too.

3104
02:40:18,430 --> 02:40:19,190
I like that.

3105
02:40:20,270 --> 02:40:21,370
I have to do this again?

3106
02:40:22,190 --> 02:40:23,270
No, thank God.

3107
02:40:23,630 --> 02:40:25,410
I was like, please no.

3108
02:40:26,130 --> 02:40:28,010
Was there anything else I missed from this area?

3109
02:40:28,990 --> 02:40:29,750
I don't remember.

3110
02:40:30,150 --> 02:40:31,350
No, it was just his grave.

3111
02:40:31,570 --> 02:40:31,790
Okay.

3112
02:40:32,290 --> 02:40:33,130
Go this way, then.

3113
02:40:34,310 --> 02:40:34,730
Unlock!

3114
02:40:42,450 --> 02:40:43,570
I'm very confused.

3115
02:40:43,570 --> 02:40:44,810
I'm very confused, guys.

3116
02:40:45,030 --> 02:40:45,750
Oh,

3117
02:40:53,740 --> 02:40:57,120
shit.

3118
02:40:58,180 --> 02:40:59,480
Oh, shit.

3119
02:40:59,980 --> 02:41:01,060
Oh, shit.

3120
02:41:06,020 --> 02:41:06,740
Okay.

3121
02:41:07,340 --> 02:41:09,980
Let me go get some kids real quick.

3122
02:41:10,640 --> 02:41:12,540
I got confused!

3123
02:41:13,540 --> 02:41:14,600
I'm sorry!

3124
02:41:15,060 --> 02:41:17,160
You know, fuck it, if I die, I die.

3125
02:41:17,160 --> 02:41:17,260
Okay.

3126
02:41:17,960 --> 02:41:21,480
I got confused.

3127
02:41:22,860 --> 02:41:26,760
My crow of mind did not know what to think.

3128
02:41:28,700 --> 02:41:29,420
What?!

3129
02:41:29,420 --> 02:41:32,020
I thought it blocked it!

3130
02:41:34,730 --> 02:41:37,110
The lasers go so fast!

3131
02:41:41,670 --> 02:41:43,670
It went too fast.

3132
02:41:43,770 --> 02:41:45,370
And I didn't know what to think.

3133
02:41:52,740 --> 02:41:53,400
Okay.

3134
02:41:53,740 --> 02:41:55,560
It went too fast.

3135
02:41:56,040 --> 02:41:58,680
Crow brain couldn't comprehend the speed.

3136
02:42:02,200 --> 02:42:04,260
I was trying to think.

3137
02:42:05,140 --> 02:42:06,400
Like, what do I...

3138
02:42:06,400 --> 02:42:07,440
Like, what?

3139
02:42:12,950 --> 02:42:13,610
Oh!

3140
02:42:13,910 --> 02:42:15,250
Okay, I figured it out.

3141
02:42:20,600 --> 02:42:22,500
Okay, I figured it out, guys.

3142
02:42:23,800 --> 02:42:24,860
Oh my God.

3143
02:42:25,040 --> 02:42:26,100
Crow key is so smart.

3144
02:42:27,420 --> 02:42:29,080
I just had to die once.

3145
02:42:29,900 --> 02:42:30,340
Ah!

3146
02:42:32,800 --> 02:42:33,240
Fuck!

3147
02:42:35,440 --> 02:42:37,320
Okay, I got a little over...

3148
02:42:37,320 --> 02:42:38,700
I got a little too excited.

3149
02:42:39,520 --> 02:42:39,960
Guys.

3150
02:42:40,980 --> 02:42:43,040
I got way too excited.

3151
02:42:43,700 --> 02:42:45,300
Okay, this is not fair.

3152
02:42:45,560 --> 02:42:46,880
This is actually not fair.

3153
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:48,280
It, like, goes...

3154
02:42:50,920 --> 02:42:53,040
Oh my God, I, like, gripped the wrong one.

3155
02:42:53,920 --> 02:42:55,400
I need to be more patient.

3156
02:42:55,760 --> 02:42:56,280
I realize.

3157
02:42:56,280 --> 02:42:56,460
I realize.

3158
02:42:57,780 --> 02:43:00,480
Guys, it's because I forgot to be patient, okay?

3159
02:43:01,800 --> 02:43:03,960
I, like, got a little too excited.

3160
02:43:09,310 --> 02:43:10,850
I, like, went too fast.

3161
02:43:13,690 --> 02:43:15,830
Don't you hate it when you go too fast?

3162
02:43:18,770 --> 02:43:19,630
There we go.

3163
02:43:22,450 --> 02:43:23,930
Gotta go fast.

3164
02:43:24,130 --> 02:43:26,050
But sometimes you don't gotta go fast.

3165
02:43:27,010 --> 02:43:28,170
Okay, nice.

3166
02:43:28,370 --> 02:43:29,750
Wait, this is just the other tomb.

3167
02:43:32,510 --> 02:43:33,210
Alright.

3168
02:43:35,720 --> 02:43:36,910
Where's the last one?

3169
02:43:39,710 --> 02:43:40,370
Oh?

3170
02:43:41,670 --> 02:43:43,510
Wait, but where's the last one?

3171
02:43:45,710 --> 02:43:46,410
Hello?

3172
02:43:46,410 --> 02:43:46,530
Hello?

3173
02:44:17,970 --> 02:44:18,990
I have no business in.

3174
02:44:19,810 --> 02:44:24,630
If opportunities present itself, child, ending the cycle will be what is right for the universe.

3175
02:44:25,210 --> 02:44:28,310
My lifetime was too short to come to that ultimate conclusion.

3176
02:44:28,830 --> 02:44:31,790
But I remain hopeful that others will reach it on their own.

3177
02:44:32,630 --> 02:44:33,350
Just a crow.

3178
02:44:33,470 --> 02:44:34,630
Why you tell me this?

3179
02:44:37,230 --> 02:44:37,790
Okay.

3180
02:44:38,290 --> 02:44:39,830
We go this way.

3181
02:44:42,070 --> 02:44:42,630
HP.

3182
02:44:42,930 --> 02:44:43,950
Wait, can I do it again?

3183
02:44:44,390 --> 02:44:44,790
Okay.

3184
02:44:44,790 --> 02:44:45,030
Okay.

3185
02:44:45,910 --> 02:44:47,530
Okay, wait, wait.

3186
02:44:52,260 --> 02:44:53,000
Come on.

3187
02:44:54,520 --> 02:44:56,120
Wake up, little kids.

3188
02:44:56,500 --> 02:44:57,200
Wake up.

3189
02:45:03,410 --> 02:45:06,310
Oh, we've always had two kids, guys.

3190
02:45:11,970 --> 02:45:13,410
What do you mean?

3191
02:45:13,490 --> 02:45:15,170
There's always been two, guys.

3192
02:45:15,670 --> 02:45:17,130
It's always been two.

3193
02:45:23,860 --> 02:45:24,340
Hello?

3194
02:45:29,600 --> 02:45:30,080
Nah.

3195
02:45:32,740 --> 02:45:34,220
Wait, where's the last one?

3196
02:45:36,020 --> 02:45:37,160
Did I do everything?

3197
02:45:38,640 --> 02:45:40,680
Is there an anchor over here that I missed?

3198
02:45:42,620 --> 02:45:44,160
Must have missed an anchor here.

3199
02:45:50,880 --> 02:45:52,500
Yeah, there's one up here.

3200
02:45:52,760 --> 02:45:53,860
Oh, there's one up here.

3201
02:45:53,860 --> 02:45:54,440
Okay.

3202
02:45:59,810 --> 02:46:01,150
Okay, and then...

3203
02:46:03,530 --> 02:46:04,210
Alright,

3204
02:46:07,550 --> 02:46:08,430
last grave.

3205
02:46:12,390 --> 02:46:14,510
Okay, where's the last one?

3206
02:46:16,930 --> 02:46:18,390
Okay, I got this.

3207
02:46:21,150 --> 02:46:22,170
What happened?

3208
02:46:22,310 --> 02:46:22,970
Oh, it's this way.

3209
02:46:29,710 --> 02:46:31,170
Oh, this way.

3210
02:46:31,310 --> 02:46:32,190
Oh wait, this is easier.

3211
02:46:32,950 --> 02:46:34,210
What the fuck?

3212
02:46:34,350 --> 02:46:35,650
This one's so easy.

3213
02:46:36,090 --> 02:46:38,070
Compared to what I had to do.

3214
02:46:39,710 --> 02:46:41,430
Open the door!

3215
02:46:41,610 --> 02:46:42,450
Let me in!

3216
02:46:42,830 --> 02:46:43,250
Nice.

3217
02:46:45,230 --> 02:46:47,210
Alright, and then...

3218
02:46:47,210 --> 02:46:48,210
Light the fire.

3219
02:46:49,470 --> 02:46:50,730
Which one are you?

3220
02:46:55,710 --> 02:46:57,270
Dragons, I'm sad.

3221
02:46:57,610 --> 02:47:04,030
I waited five and a half hours for the secret casting chair to reveal in the Avengers Doomsday cast announcement video.

3222
02:47:04,270 --> 02:47:06,790
Hopefully she'll show up in the secret wars.

3223
02:47:06,950 --> 02:47:07,850
Thank you for the super chat.

3224
02:47:07,950 --> 02:47:08,690
Thank you, thank you.

3225
02:47:08,930 --> 02:47:10,070
Oh yeah, I saw that on Twitter.

3226
02:47:10,530 --> 02:47:17,370
They kept hyping up being like, the reveal would be even bigger than the Robert Downey Jr. Doctor Doom reveal.

3227
02:47:18,130 --> 02:47:26,150
I was just like, and the people that sat there and just watched this fucking video of them slowly revealing casting chairs one by one by one.

3228
02:47:26,730 --> 02:47:28,910
And I was like, that's a...

3229
02:47:28,910 --> 02:47:30,550
Who's got the time for that?

3230
02:47:32,610 --> 02:47:34,410
What was the reveal, guys?

3231
02:47:34,530 --> 02:47:35,470
I was just gonna wait until...

3232
02:47:36,150 --> 02:47:37,230
Apparently Carl does.

3233
02:47:37,310 --> 02:47:38,130
I'm sorry, Carl.

3234
02:47:41,970 --> 02:47:47,470
What was the reveal that was supposed to be even bigger than Robert Downey Jr.?

3235
02:47:48,330 --> 02:47:53,270
Here lies Lord Opengate, the third in the lineage of the Lords.

3236
02:47:54,350 --> 02:47:56,570
Their rule was steady and without hindrance.

3237
02:47:56,930 --> 02:48:03,890
A skilled delegation that spent many of their years expanding their knowledge while traveling the vastness of space.

3238
02:48:04,110 --> 02:48:06,470
Like, anyone actually import it?

3239
02:48:10,420 --> 02:48:11,100
New outfit?

3240
02:48:11,220 --> 02:48:12,400
The fuck does that mean?

3241
02:48:12,560 --> 02:48:14,060
I have not paid attention to...

3242
02:48:14,060 --> 02:48:19,540
Oh my god, I remember last time I trash talked Marvel Cinematic Universe and I had one person in my...

3243
02:48:19,540 --> 02:48:21,820
in the comments that got really mad about it.

3244
02:48:21,880 --> 02:48:24,740
Saying how Marvel movies are like one of the best movies out there.

3245
02:48:24,740 --> 02:48:27,960
And I'm like, you gotta watch more movies.

3246
02:48:29,600 --> 02:48:33,400
I'll say maybe in the beginning, but post Avengers?

3247
02:48:34,220 --> 02:48:34,880
Post like...

3248
02:48:35,380 --> 02:48:35,840
What was it?

3249
02:48:36,140 --> 02:48:36,700
Post...

3250
02:48:36,700 --> 02:48:38,440
The Endgame?

3251
02:48:38,720 --> 02:48:40,560
I don't think so.

3252
02:48:46,360 --> 02:48:47,620
Greetings, young Reaper.

3253
02:48:48,580 --> 02:48:50,740
Your presence here is quite a conundrum.

3254
02:48:51,420 --> 02:48:57,800
It will indicate that the course of events which started with the formation of Death's Door has led the universe to bring a great peril.

3255
02:48:58,680 --> 02:49:03,780
However, it is also indicative of those actions correcting themselves.

3256
02:49:04,140 --> 02:49:06,200
Oh no, I would say... Okay.

3257
02:49:07,120 --> 02:49:08,080
I told you guys.

3258
02:49:08,720 --> 02:49:12,880
I got really bored of like, Marvel movies very, very early on.

3259
02:49:13,040 --> 02:49:14,780
I've never watched Captain America.

3260
02:49:15,140 --> 02:49:18,820
I've never watched any of the Avengers movies other than Endgame.

3261
02:49:19,140 --> 02:49:23,960
I've only... I watched Guardians... I actually really like Guardians of the Galaxy because I love the director.

3262
02:49:24,420 --> 02:49:30,000
I think the director is a really... I love his directing style, so I've always like, watched like, majority of his stuff.

3263
02:49:30,600 --> 02:49:32,740
Especially like, what he's doing with DC right now.

3264
02:49:33,660 --> 02:49:36,680
And like, I never watched Captain America.

3265
02:49:36,760 --> 02:49:44,020
I heard Captain America 1 was pretty good, but like, I got really tired of superhero movies from the MCU a very long time ago.

3266
02:49:45,640 --> 02:49:47,480
Yeah, I love James Gunn's stuff.

3267
02:49:47,540 --> 02:49:48,380
I love his stuff.

3268
02:49:48,380 --> 02:49:50,140
I love what he did for the...

3269
02:49:50,140 --> 02:49:51,080
What is it called?

3270
02:49:51,600 --> 02:49:52,080
The...

3271
02:49:53,040 --> 02:49:56,340
Um... The Suicide Squad one, but for the Monsters...

3272
02:49:56,340 --> 02:49:57,380
Oh, I forgot what it's called.

3273
02:49:57,480 --> 02:49:58,280
The animated show?

3274
02:49:58,900 --> 02:50:01,760
It's really... I personally really enjoyed it.

3275
02:50:02,180 --> 02:50:04,340
I was so surprised with like...

3276
02:50:04,340 --> 02:50:05,120
Ha ha ha!

3277
02:50:05,400 --> 02:50:10,060
Like, I was so surprised with like, some of the writing they did for it.

3278
02:50:10,360 --> 02:50:12,220
Because it was like, so...

3279
02:50:12,220 --> 02:50:14,400
They had like, really good plot twists and stuff.

3280
02:50:14,580 --> 02:50:16,420
And also that moment when...

3281
02:50:16,420 --> 02:50:17,920
Um... Uh...

3282
02:50:17,920 --> 02:50:18,620
Oh my god, what was that?

3283
02:50:19,100 --> 02:50:21,960
The GI robot?

3284
02:50:22,260 --> 02:50:23,080
Ha ha ha!

3285
02:50:25,220 --> 02:50:28,500
You know that scene where he was like...

3286
02:50:28,500 --> 02:50:29,660
Huh...

3287
02:50:29,660 --> 02:50:30,860
Ha ha ha!

3288
02:50:32,500 --> 02:50:34,300
That was so good!

3289
02:50:34,920 --> 02:50:35,700
Ha ha ha!

3290
02:50:37,920 --> 02:50:40,080
What was the... Creature Commandos!

3291
02:50:40,160 --> 02:50:40,600
Yeah, yeah.

3292
02:50:40,660 --> 02:50:45,540
If you like superhero stuff, I highly recommend checking out Creature Commandos.

3293
02:50:45,760 --> 02:50:47,080
Yeah, no, James Gunn!

3294
02:50:47,180 --> 02:50:47,760
Yeah, he did!

3295
02:50:48,040 --> 02:50:48,920
He worked on that.

3296
02:50:49,420 --> 02:50:49,680
Yeah.

3297
02:50:50,280 --> 02:50:52,420
And like, they're expanding the...

3298
02:50:52,420 --> 02:50:54,420
They're gonna base the new...

3299
02:50:54,420 --> 02:50:58,720
They're gonna base the new DC, I guess like...

3300
02:50:58,720 --> 02:51:01,000
The DC Cinematic Universe.

3301
02:51:01,380 --> 02:51:05,960
They're gonna base off the DC Cinematic Universe off of Creature Commandos and stuff.

3302
02:51:06,480 --> 02:51:07,520
Uh... Ha ha ha!

3303
02:51:07,960 --> 02:51:10,640
Which is pretty crazy to think about.

3304
02:51:10,700 --> 02:51:14,460
So they're revamping the entire story off of Creature Commandos.

3305
02:51:14,700 --> 02:51:16,160
Cause that's canon now.

3306
02:51:17,660 --> 02:51:18,160
Uh...

3307
02:51:18,160 --> 02:51:21,880
Life is merely the universe experiencing itself.

3308
02:51:22,360 --> 02:51:23,020
And that's it.

3309
02:51:23,080 --> 02:51:24,620
I just like James Gunn's stuff in general.

3310
02:51:24,800 --> 02:51:26,800
I think he's a very talented director and writer.

3311
02:51:28,140 --> 02:51:28,640
Uh...

3312
02:51:28,640 --> 02:51:30,340
And I also love... What was it called?

3313
02:51:30,460 --> 02:51:32,360
The one with... The one with John Cena?

3314
02:51:33,180 --> 02:51:34,180
Um... Peacemaker!

3315
02:51:34,460 --> 02:51:35,200
I like that one.

3316
02:51:35,300 --> 02:51:35,760
That show.

3317
02:51:36,100 --> 02:51:37,740
Cause he directed that too.

3318
02:51:38,940 --> 02:51:41,940
We as parts of it are all acting to maintain that balance.

3319
02:51:42,180 --> 02:51:43,700
Stay true to your path, young reaper.

3320
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:45,760
And I can sense victory in your future.

3321
02:51:46,560 --> 02:51:47,520
I like Peacemaker.

3322
02:51:47,820 --> 02:51:49,000
That was a really good show too.

3323
02:51:49,340 --> 02:51:51,160
And that's directed by James Gunn as well.

3324
02:51:54,870 --> 02:51:55,310
Whoa!

3325
02:51:55,450 --> 02:51:56,570
Into the hole I go!

3326
02:51:57,250 --> 02:51:58,650
Where did I... Where did I go?

3327
02:51:59,650 --> 02:52:02,250
I don't remember where his body was.

3328
02:52:02,310 --> 02:52:04,130
Oh, that's where his body was.

3329
02:52:04,490 --> 02:52:04,730
Solid!

3330
02:52:04,910 --> 02:52:05,710
Thank you for the super chat!

3331
02:52:05,850 --> 02:52:06,610
Thank you!

3332
02:52:06,950 --> 02:52:08,270
Master Sky Croaky.

3333
02:52:08,430 --> 02:52:09,590
What are we going to do now?

3334
02:52:09,590 --> 02:52:13,170
Croaky likes super activation noise.

3335
02:52:13,450 --> 02:52:14,410
Thank you for the super chat.

3336
02:52:14,510 --> 02:52:16,090
Thank you, thank you.

3337
02:52:17,210 --> 02:52:18,910
John Cena has always been a really good actor.

3338
02:52:20,430 --> 02:52:23,950
Compared... And then The Rock is like the opposite spectrum of that.

3339
02:52:26,750 --> 02:52:29,010
Hey, you got that old elevator working.

3340
02:52:29,690 --> 02:52:31,410
The Rock literally just plays himself.

3341
02:52:31,570 --> 02:52:33,390
John Cena is actually acting.

3342
02:52:35,450 --> 02:52:38,050
I just finished the next chapter of my song.

3343
02:52:38,570 --> 02:52:40,350
Yeah, I wanna hear your song.

3344
02:52:42,190 --> 02:52:43,310
Here we go!

3345
02:52:45,230 --> 02:52:46,930
That's not a mask!

3346
02:52:47,530 --> 02:52:49,410
That's a part of your head!

3347
02:52:50,710 --> 02:52:52,930
Tell you a tale as old as time.

3348
02:52:53,670 --> 02:52:56,030
A classic repeating paradigm.

3349
02:52:59,330 --> 02:53:01,750
A mating trapped at the peak of our climb.

3350
02:53:03,330 --> 02:53:04,810
Don't judge him.

3351
02:53:04,810 --> 02:53:07,990
Her fishman love driven out of his mind.

3352
02:53:10,530 --> 02:53:13,710
The hero will right the wrongs of his crime.

3353
02:53:14,550 --> 02:53:15,150
That's me.

3354
02:53:15,230 --> 02:53:15,790
I'm hero.

3355
02:53:16,850 --> 02:53:17,410
That it?

3356
02:53:18,770 --> 02:53:20,150
That was a song.

3357
02:53:21,730 --> 02:53:23,470
Alright, then I'll meet you further up the mountain.

3358
02:53:23,650 --> 02:53:24,810
Don't get into trouble on the way.

3359
02:53:24,890 --> 02:53:26,030
At least not without me.

3360
02:53:26,450 --> 02:53:27,910
It was a song, guys.

3361
02:53:28,630 --> 02:53:31,430
I won't say it was a good song, but it was a song.

3362
02:53:31,430 --> 02:53:34,010
I spent all that time writing that.

3363
02:53:38,030 --> 02:53:39,070
Alright, let's see.

3364
02:53:39,130 --> 02:53:39,590
This way.

3365
02:53:43,410 --> 02:53:45,010
Wait, where am I?

3366
02:53:45,690 --> 02:53:46,710
Where is Croaky?

3367
02:53:47,510 --> 02:53:48,790
Oh, I'm up top!

3368
02:53:49,370 --> 02:53:50,190
Back to see.

3369
02:53:51,930 --> 02:53:53,670
Oh, I'm up here now!

3370
02:53:55,350 --> 02:53:56,610
Is there anything here?

3371
02:53:56,870 --> 02:53:57,250
A secret?

3372
02:53:57,490 --> 02:53:58,090
No secret.

3373
02:53:59,290 --> 02:54:00,710
We gotta go this way.

3374
02:54:01,570 --> 02:54:02,290
Phew!

3375
02:54:04,950 --> 02:54:06,330
What the fuck?

3376
02:54:06,650 --> 02:54:08,910
In his final breaths, he slapped me.

3377
02:54:11,490 --> 02:54:12,210
Okay.

3378
02:54:14,850 --> 02:54:16,710
We gotta grab some money.

3379
02:54:17,810 --> 02:54:19,010
Is there anything here?

3380
02:54:20,690 --> 02:54:21,970
No, there's nothing there.

3381
02:54:23,590 --> 02:54:25,570
I don't need a learn to fly.

3382
02:54:26,310 --> 02:54:27,470
I have my hook.

3383
02:54:30,710 --> 02:54:32,410
Okay, we gotta go up here.

3384
02:54:35,030 --> 02:54:37,010
I can't believe he slapped me before he died.

3385
02:54:37,930 --> 02:54:39,030
I'm so fucked up.

3386
02:54:40,110 --> 02:54:41,470
Only I can slap.

3387
02:54:44,290 --> 02:54:46,330
Who gave that guy rights to slap?

3388
02:54:49,950 --> 02:54:51,210
Can I use this to hurt him?

3389
02:54:51,330 --> 02:54:51,650
Oh!

3390
02:54:56,150 --> 02:54:57,490
Okay, that's scary.

3391
02:55:00,270 --> 02:55:00,650
Okay.

3392
02:55:00,790 --> 02:55:02,450
Okay, now I know a kid does that.

3393
02:55:02,830 --> 02:55:03,950
Okay, I learned.

3394
02:55:05,370 --> 02:55:06,170
Oh, there's seeds.

3395
02:55:06,770 --> 02:55:07,390
Hello, children.

3396
02:55:08,790 --> 02:55:10,470
I will not send you to your deaths.

3397
02:55:10,570 --> 02:55:11,130
Don't worry.

3398
02:55:13,710 --> 02:55:15,390
I don't know if I'll ever do that.

3399
02:55:16,150 --> 02:55:18,190
Why would I ever have to get close to them?

3400
02:55:21,570 --> 02:55:22,490
Is there something here?

3401
02:55:22,510 --> 02:55:22,930
Oh wait, no.

3402
02:55:23,010 --> 02:55:23,450
Never mind.

3403
02:55:23,550 --> 02:55:24,910
I thought I could go across that wall.

3404
02:55:24,910 --> 02:55:27,260
Walk in the straight line.

3405
02:55:27,930 --> 02:55:29,450
Walk in the straight line.

3406
02:55:29,570 --> 02:55:31,130
Cause there's fall damage.

3407
02:55:35,950 --> 02:55:36,290
Hello?

3408
02:55:40,540 --> 02:55:41,280
Hello?

3409
02:55:42,520 --> 02:55:43,820
Oh, children.

3410
02:55:45,840 --> 02:55:46,240
Doink.

3411
02:55:46,460 --> 02:55:47,720
My child now.

3412
02:55:49,540 --> 02:55:50,620
Unhand me.

3413
02:55:52,160 --> 02:55:53,760
You're coming with me.

3414
02:55:55,510 --> 02:55:57,880
No way to get to that side door.

3415
02:55:57,880 --> 02:55:59,240
Wait, do I have enough?

3416
02:55:59,360 --> 02:55:59,940
No, I don't.

3417
02:56:01,000 --> 02:56:02,640
I don't have enough for upgrades.

3418
02:56:03,480 --> 02:56:04,720
Do I have an extra key?

3419
02:56:05,480 --> 02:56:06,000
No.

3420
02:56:08,140 --> 02:56:08,980
Wait.

3421
02:56:11,660 --> 02:56:12,560
There's crows?

3422
02:56:15,800 --> 02:56:20,200
Welcome to free crows?

3423
02:56:21,460 --> 02:56:22,300
Free?

3424
02:56:22,300 --> 02:56:22,500
Free?

3425
02:56:26,820 --> 02:56:28,160
Old friend.

3426
02:56:28,940 --> 02:56:30,780
We knew you'd make it here eventually.

3427
02:56:31,160 --> 02:56:32,000
Oh my god.

3428
02:56:32,100 --> 02:56:33,260
The stories were real.

3429
02:56:33,740 --> 02:56:34,720
They were real.

3430
02:56:36,080 --> 02:56:41,700
They don't have to work on the farm cause it was all real.

3431
02:56:44,540 --> 02:56:47,360
Even you need a bit of guidance along the way.

3432
02:56:48,820 --> 02:56:49,260
Hehehehe.

3433
02:56:50,040 --> 02:56:51,780
We are a group of free thinking.

3434
02:56:52,000 --> 02:56:53,500
You get to think for free?

3435
02:56:54,340 --> 02:56:57,380
You don't have to tell your supervisor what you're thinking about today?

3436
02:56:58,540 --> 02:56:58,980
Hahahahaha.

3437
02:57:00,620 --> 02:57:03,380
We reject the ideas of the lord of the doors.

3438
02:57:03,880 --> 02:57:08,960
We do not want unnatural mortality if it must come at the cost of our lives.

3439
02:57:09,480 --> 02:57:12,600
What is the point in living forever if it is to be a slave?

3440
02:57:13,200 --> 02:57:16,660
No, we choose to live free and die free.

3441
02:57:17,260 --> 02:57:18,960
So go, climb ever higher.

3442
02:57:19,320 --> 02:57:22,460
Defeat the beast at the top of the mountain and claim its soul.

3443
02:57:22,860 --> 02:57:25,880
Oh, but make sure you're well prepared before you head onwards.

3444
02:57:26,480 --> 02:57:29,340
Remember, you're welcome here anytime you like.

3445
02:57:29,480 --> 02:57:30,980
Oh my god.

3446
02:57:31,480 --> 02:57:32,320
It's real.

3447
02:57:33,460 --> 02:57:34,820
The stories are true.

3448
02:57:35,940 --> 02:57:37,600
Why are you free if you wear clothes?

3449
02:57:39,080 --> 02:57:39,680
Hahahahaha.

3450
02:57:40,160 --> 02:57:41,780
Welcome, foretold crow.

3451
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:45,740
We have a simple life here, foraging and living off the land.

3452
02:57:46,340 --> 02:57:50,020
We even use fur shed by the beasts atop the mountain as bedding.

3453
02:57:50,080 --> 02:57:54,200
I don't understand if we're free, why you wear clothes?

3454
02:57:55,500 --> 02:57:56,040
Hahahahaha.

3455
02:57:57,580 --> 02:58:00,180
You can be whoever you wanna be.

3456
02:58:02,140 --> 02:58:05,580
We all abandon our assignments, which means our life now ticks away.

3457
02:58:05,880 --> 02:58:07,720
However, we are happier for it.

3458
02:58:07,800 --> 02:58:09,280
This is the way it should be.

3459
02:58:10,740 --> 02:58:12,680
Without death, new life cannot grow.

3460
02:58:13,640 --> 02:58:15,020
Look, I'm not wearing clothes.

3461
02:58:15,140 --> 02:58:16,200
Oh wait, no, I'm wearing pants.

3462
02:58:19,080 --> 02:58:19,440
Hahahahaha.

3463
02:58:20,200 --> 02:58:22,660
Foretold crow, it is an honor to meet you.

3464
02:58:23,280 --> 02:58:25,140
Did you find any of our shrines on your journey?

3465
02:58:25,600 --> 02:58:28,120
It seems there are still ten shrines you have yet to find.

3466
02:58:28,640 --> 02:58:30,880
I'm sure they will help you on your journey in the fight with the beasts.

3467
02:58:30,960 --> 02:58:31,860
I don't need that.

3468
02:58:32,740 --> 02:58:33,980
I don't need shrines.

3469
02:58:34,100 --> 02:58:35,220
I'm going in.

3470
02:58:36,600 --> 02:58:38,340
How do I kidnap this child?

3471
02:58:38,340 --> 02:58:40,240
Oh, it's here.

3472
02:58:40,380 --> 02:58:41,040
Okay, nice.

3473
02:58:43,220 --> 02:58:44,240
Greetings, foretold crow.

3474
02:58:44,720 --> 02:58:46,180
This is a gate of knowledge.

3475
02:58:46,780 --> 02:58:48,260
Its eyes see all things.

3476
02:58:48,720 --> 02:58:50,180
Its heart knows all things.

3477
02:58:50,760 --> 02:58:52,420
Its soul exists in all things.

3478
02:58:53,640 --> 02:58:58,580
It whispers to us that when we need guidance, it foretold your arrival and your destiny.

3479
02:59:00,500 --> 02:59:01,460
What does it do?

3480
02:59:01,700 --> 02:59:02,640
How do I turn it on?

3481
02:59:06,360 --> 02:59:07,960
I can't believe it.

3482
02:59:09,860 --> 02:59:13,540
Is there something I can take off my pants when I become a free crow?

3483
02:59:15,460 --> 02:59:16,540
Okay, here we go.

3484
02:59:16,720 --> 02:59:17,560
Where do I go?

3485
02:59:17,940 --> 02:59:18,880
Oh, there's the bard.

3486
02:59:19,500 --> 02:59:21,600
Oh my god, that has a crow head.

3487
02:59:22,980 --> 02:59:24,020
Okay, I'll go up.

3488
02:59:27,260 --> 02:59:28,180
Hello, bard.

3489
02:59:30,600 --> 02:59:30,880
Phew.

3490
02:59:31,080 --> 02:59:33,260
It's quite a steep climb getting up here.

3491
02:59:33,740 --> 02:59:35,220
My pipes are still wheezing.

3492
02:59:35,540 --> 02:59:37,440
You must be pleased I punched though, huh?

3493
02:59:37,440 --> 02:59:39,880
I mean, a secret crow society?

3494
02:59:40,140 --> 02:59:42,520
Wait, how do you know about the secret crow society?

3495
02:59:43,680 --> 02:59:46,060
And they have so many great stories about their lives up here.

3496
02:59:46,620 --> 02:59:48,820
Especially about the beast on top of the mountain.

3497
02:59:49,500 --> 02:59:52,100
Yeah, I'm getting so much inspiration on our adventure.

3498
02:59:52,560 --> 02:59:55,860
I think my next song might be the greatest I've ever written.

3499
02:59:56,000 --> 02:59:57,460
And I've written more than five.

3500
02:59:57,660 --> 03:00:00,020
Oh my god, so fucking talented you are.

3501
03:00:01,460 --> 03:00:02,760
Alright, I'll go this way then.

3502
03:00:03,440 --> 03:00:04,680
Feels like this is...

3503
03:00:04,680 --> 03:00:06,540
The frozen canyon.

3504
03:00:07,220 --> 03:00:08,160
Ooh.

3505
03:00:08,440 --> 03:00:10,160
That sounds exciting.

3506
03:00:12,020 --> 03:00:13,240
How does that take me?

3507
03:00:18,590 --> 03:00:19,910
Okay.

3508
03:00:22,210 --> 03:00:23,530
Okay.

3509
03:00:25,590 --> 03:00:27,830
I understand now.

3510
03:00:29,490 --> 03:00:31,470
Okay, I understand.

3511
03:00:33,930 --> 03:00:35,270
Wait, what?

3512
03:00:38,130 --> 03:00:40,290
Wait, why would I have to...

3513
03:00:40,290 --> 03:00:40,670
Huh.

3514
03:00:45,070 --> 03:00:47,610
Oh no, it's just like Crash Bandicoot.

3515
03:00:50,350 --> 03:00:50,950
Whee!

3516
03:00:54,830 --> 03:00:56,390
Wait, but like...

3517
03:00:57,050 --> 03:00:57,470
Oh.

3518
03:00:58,730 --> 03:00:59,330
Oh.

3519
03:01:00,510 --> 03:01:01,110
Woah,

3520
03:01:04,710 --> 03:01:06,250
woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.

3521
03:01:06,250 --> 03:01:06,550
Woah.

3522
03:01:08,110 --> 03:01:08,710
Woah.

3523
03:01:10,290 --> 03:01:10,890
Woah.

3524
03:01:12,590 --> 03:01:13,190
Woah.

3525
03:01:14,090 --> 03:01:15,530
Is it worth it?

3526
03:01:18,800 --> 03:01:20,900
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.

3527
03:01:21,140 --> 03:01:21,500
Okay.

3528
03:01:22,380 --> 03:01:23,480
Wait, is this worth it?

3529
03:01:25,140 --> 03:01:27,100
I don't think it's worth it, right?

3530
03:01:31,170 --> 03:01:32,610
Okay, this is hard.

3531
03:01:33,530 --> 03:01:34,870
This is actually really hard.

3532
03:01:34,870 --> 03:01:35,010
This is hard.

3533
03:01:39,520 --> 03:01:40,280
Oh.

3534
03:01:44,850 --> 03:01:46,230
God damn.

3535
03:01:46,430 --> 03:01:47,250
Not one HP.

3536
03:01:49,310 --> 03:01:51,250
Wait, this is so difficult.

3537
03:01:55,410 --> 03:01:56,170
Okay.

3538
03:01:56,710 --> 03:01:57,870
Okay, nice.

3539
03:01:58,730 --> 03:02:00,510
Wait, but is it even worth it?

3540
03:02:00,830 --> 03:02:01,910
I can't tell.

3541
03:02:07,740 --> 03:02:09,400
Oh, one HP and a dream.

3542
03:02:10,960 --> 03:02:11,640
No!

3543
03:02:21,050 --> 03:02:21,810
Okay.

3544
03:02:25,230 --> 03:02:26,430
Oh, okay, I get it.

3545
03:02:26,490 --> 03:02:27,230
I get it now.

3546
03:02:27,410 --> 03:02:28,170
I get it.

3547
03:02:28,290 --> 03:02:28,950
I get it.

3548
03:02:29,550 --> 03:02:30,670
I get it.

3549
03:02:31,870 --> 03:02:33,730
But do you really get it, Croaky?

3550
03:02:41,920 --> 03:02:42,360
Okay.

3551
03:02:43,360 --> 03:02:44,840
This first, and then...

3552
03:02:45,540 --> 03:02:45,980
WHAT?!

3553
03:02:47,460 --> 03:02:48,680
Okay, that's fucked up.

3554
03:02:49,460 --> 03:02:50,900
Okay, I did it too fast.

3555
03:02:50,940 --> 03:02:52,720
I did it too fast, but I get it now.

3556
03:02:57,290 --> 03:02:57,730
Okay.

3557
03:03:07,000 --> 03:03:07,440
Okay.

3558
03:03:07,440 --> 03:03:08,080
Okay.

3559
03:03:08,120 --> 03:03:09,320
Now I got this.

3560
03:03:11,760 --> 03:03:12,920
There we go.

3561
03:03:13,920 --> 03:03:15,900
And then I drop...

3562
03:03:15,900 --> 03:03:16,740
down.

3563
03:03:18,100 --> 03:03:20,120
Okay, I got a little scared.

3564
03:03:21,320 --> 03:03:23,060
I'm not gonna lie.

3565
03:03:23,420 --> 03:03:26,120
I did get a little scared there.

3566
03:03:29,250 --> 03:03:32,110
I wanna know...

3567
03:03:32,650 --> 03:03:33,050
Okay.

3568
03:03:33,810 --> 03:03:34,830
That's fucked.

3569
03:03:34,830 --> 03:03:35,170
That's...

3570
03:03:39,030 --> 03:03:41,030
Okay, I wanna know if I can...

3571
03:03:41,030 --> 03:03:41,830
grab it.

3572
03:03:42,010 --> 03:03:42,970
No, I can't.

3573
03:03:43,110 --> 03:03:43,370
Okay.

3574
03:03:44,550 --> 03:03:46,830
Okay, I gotta...

3575
03:03:47,950 --> 03:03:49,090
Oh my god.

3576
03:03:50,010 --> 03:03:50,850
Oh my god.

3577
03:03:51,310 --> 03:03:51,490
Oh.

3578
03:03:52,570 --> 03:03:53,190
Oh.

3579
03:03:57,010 --> 03:03:57,570
No!

3580
03:03:58,810 --> 03:04:00,870
That's so fucked up!

3581
03:04:00,870 --> 03:04:04,350
Oh my god!

3582
03:04:07,690 --> 03:04:08,070
Okay.

3583
03:04:08,550 --> 03:04:09,910
I do it here.

3584
03:04:20,830 --> 03:04:24,410
It was just for that?!

3585
03:04:30,990 --> 03:04:33,410
That's all it was?!

3586
03:04:33,410 --> 03:04:35,270
I don't even have...

3587
03:04:35,270 --> 03:04:36,590
I don't even have enough!

3588
03:04:37,350 --> 03:04:40,650
I don't even...

3589
03:04:42,890 --> 03:04:44,910
Oh my god.

3590
03:04:47,310 --> 03:04:48,310
I can't believe...

3591
03:04:48,310 --> 03:04:49,290
that was what it was for.

3592
03:04:50,010 --> 03:04:51,770
I can't believe it.

3593
03:04:52,250 --> 03:04:54,390
I thought it would be something cooler.

3594
03:04:55,170 --> 03:04:56,730
It could have given me like...

3595
03:04:57,310 --> 03:04:58,570
two at least.

3596
03:04:59,530 --> 03:05:00,990
I don't even get...

3597
03:05:00,990 --> 03:05:02,070
plus one HP.

3598
03:05:02,870 --> 03:05:04,830
I'm going in there with one...

3599
03:05:04,830 --> 03:05:05,250
Fuck it.

3600
03:05:05,310 --> 03:05:06,590
I'm going in there with one HP.

3601
03:05:07,050 --> 03:05:07,990
Fuck it.

3602
03:05:07,990 --> 03:05:09,110
Let's go.

3603
03:05:11,090 --> 03:05:13,790
But the experience...

3604
03:05:13,790 --> 03:05:14,650
Fuck it.

3605
03:05:15,110 --> 03:05:16,550
We're doing it live.

3606
03:05:19,730 --> 03:05:21,610
There must be children up here.

3607
03:05:22,510 --> 03:05:23,670
There's always kids.

3608
03:05:26,470 --> 03:05:27,450
Come on.

3609
03:05:27,550 --> 03:05:28,470
Where are the kids?

3610
03:05:30,730 --> 03:05:32,050
Where can I plant...

3611
03:05:33,250 --> 03:05:34,190
the children?

3612
03:05:34,590 --> 03:05:36,210
Wait, I might be able to get my HP back.

3613
03:05:37,270 --> 03:05:37,990
Alright.

3614
03:05:38,530 --> 03:05:39,930
In through door, out through door.

3615
03:05:41,810 --> 03:05:42,810
Yes, alright.

3616
03:05:42,930 --> 03:05:43,390
Thank god.

3617
03:05:44,230 --> 03:05:45,150
I recharged my HP.

3618
03:05:50,330 --> 03:05:51,050
Okay.

3619
03:05:52,290 --> 03:05:53,270
Do I have to go this way?

3620
03:05:56,210 --> 03:05:57,710
I have to go down.

3621
03:05:58,190 --> 03:05:58,550
Right?

3622
03:05:58,910 --> 03:05:59,310
Yeah.

3623
03:06:00,730 --> 03:06:01,450
Boom!

3624
03:06:02,310 --> 03:06:02,910
Nice.

3625
03:06:04,290 --> 03:06:04,830
Okay.

3626
03:06:06,730 --> 03:06:07,450
Nice.

3627
03:06:07,450 --> 03:06:08,150
Alright.

3628
03:06:08,330 --> 03:06:11,590
Look at that boss music for the last round.

3629
03:06:12,290 --> 03:06:12,970
I think it has...

3630
03:06:12,970 --> 03:06:14,630
I don't know if this would be the last...

3631
03:06:14,630 --> 03:06:16,650
There has to be one more level after this.

3632
03:06:17,370 --> 03:06:18,350
After the beast.

3633
03:06:19,770 --> 03:06:21,490
But I feel very...

3634
03:06:21,490 --> 03:06:23,330
motivated right now to kill.

3635
03:06:28,630 --> 03:06:29,130
Boom.

3636
03:06:33,190 --> 03:06:34,190
Me first.

3637
03:06:36,790 --> 03:06:37,130
Okay.

3638
03:06:38,770 --> 03:06:39,430
Nice.

3639
03:06:39,430 --> 03:06:39,510
Nice.

3640
03:06:41,990 --> 03:06:44,310
Why is there so many hook areas?

3641
03:06:48,890 --> 03:06:50,770
It must be the last guy to kill.

3642
03:06:52,630 --> 03:06:53,670
Oh, there you go!

3643
03:06:53,730 --> 03:06:54,250
Look at that!

3644
03:06:54,350 --> 03:06:54,670
Children!

3645
03:06:57,350 --> 03:06:57,590
Woah!

3646
03:06:59,650 --> 03:07:00,230
Woah!

3647
03:07:01,650 --> 03:07:02,370
Don't worry.

3648
03:07:03,070 --> 03:07:04,430
Don't worry, kids!

3649
03:07:05,530 --> 03:07:07,010
I planted the seed!

3650
03:07:09,210 --> 03:07:10,910
Why is there so many hooks?

3651
03:07:12,970 --> 03:07:14,350
What am I hooking for?

3652
03:07:18,010 --> 03:07:20,150
Feel my spirit, children!

3653
03:07:20,890 --> 03:07:22,070
Oh, what the fuck?

3654
03:07:22,090 --> 03:07:22,590
He dodges.

3655
03:07:23,750 --> 03:07:26,090
Wait, he's not supposed to do that.

3656
03:07:30,270 --> 03:07:30,590
Okay.

3657
03:07:31,610 --> 03:07:32,250
Boom!

3658
03:07:35,650 --> 03:07:37,090
Get the safety.

3659
03:07:37,310 --> 03:07:38,990
Don't worry, I'll protect you.

3660
03:07:42,830 --> 03:07:44,310
I am a protector.

3661
03:07:45,810 --> 03:07:47,670
Oh, I can't open this yet.

3662
03:07:48,090 --> 03:07:49,590
Don't worry, children!

3663
03:07:51,130 --> 03:07:53,530
I'll definitely protect you.

3664
03:07:54,550 --> 03:07:55,210
Oh, shit.

3665
03:07:56,210 --> 03:07:57,490
I didn't protect myself first.

3666
03:07:58,770 --> 03:07:59,330
Boom.

3667
03:08:01,050 --> 03:08:02,330
Oh, he missed.

3668
03:08:02,710 --> 03:08:03,150
Stupid.

3669
03:08:05,210 --> 03:08:06,430
Oh, fuck!

3670
03:08:09,690 --> 03:08:10,810
Oh, fuck!

3671
03:08:10,810 --> 03:08:11,870
Okay, maybe...

3672
03:08:12,210 --> 03:08:12,810
Okay, nice.

3673
03:08:12,950 --> 03:08:13,970
Okay, the lasers kill.

3674
03:08:14,750 --> 03:08:15,790
That's good to know.

3675
03:08:17,850 --> 03:08:19,650
Wait, can they hurt me from here?

3676
03:08:20,710 --> 03:08:21,070
Ow!

3677
03:08:21,450 --> 03:08:22,250
Yes, they can.

3678
03:08:23,930 --> 03:08:24,170
Ow!

3679
03:08:25,930 --> 03:08:26,490
Fuck!

3680
03:08:28,170 --> 03:08:29,250
Oh my god, fuck!

3681
03:08:30,270 --> 03:08:30,830
Okay.

3682
03:08:32,890 --> 03:08:35,250
I'm gonna use the laser to my advantage.

3683
03:08:37,730 --> 03:08:39,150
There we go.

3684
03:08:39,410 --> 03:08:40,510
I lived!

3685
03:08:41,370 --> 03:08:42,770
I lived!

3686
03:08:43,670 --> 03:08:45,470
Okay, I'm going back to the kids.

3687
03:08:47,590 --> 03:08:49,030
Give me a sec.

3688
03:08:49,910 --> 03:08:50,630
Children!

3689
03:08:51,030 --> 03:08:52,110
Krooky needs health!

3690
03:08:53,150 --> 03:08:54,470
Get over here!

3691
03:08:57,050 --> 03:08:58,550
I lived!

3692
03:08:59,190 --> 03:09:00,110
Thank god.

3693
03:09:00,390 --> 03:09:01,450
Thank god.

3694
03:09:04,720 --> 03:09:05,640
Alright.

3695
03:09:05,640 --> 03:09:05,820
Alright.

3696
03:09:06,580 --> 03:09:07,620
I climb up.

3697
03:09:09,800 --> 03:09:11,340
I go down.

3698
03:09:15,950 --> 03:09:16,940
Oh, there he is.

3699
03:09:18,260 --> 03:09:19,840
Come down here and fight me!

3700
03:09:20,540 --> 03:09:21,660
Stupid whore!

3701
03:09:22,260 --> 03:09:23,420
Come down here!

3702
03:09:23,580 --> 03:09:24,940
That's where I'm talking about you!

3703
03:09:25,860 --> 03:09:27,700
All he can go is back and forth.

3704
03:09:27,820 --> 03:09:29,020
So fucking stupid.

3705
03:09:32,640 --> 03:09:33,300
Okay.

3706
03:09:33,300 --> 03:09:34,080
Okay.

3707
03:09:34,080 --> 03:09:34,520
Okay,

3708
03:09:39,160 --> 03:09:39,560
nice.

3709
03:09:40,800 --> 03:09:42,380
Wait, is that...

3710
03:09:42,380 --> 03:09:43,100
Wait, come down.

3711
03:09:45,720 --> 03:09:46,740
Oh, fuck!

3712
03:09:46,820 --> 03:09:47,400
Not like that!

3713
03:09:49,100 --> 03:09:50,300
Is that what I meant?

3714
03:09:51,800 --> 03:09:53,140
Not fair.

3715
03:09:54,980 --> 03:09:56,120
What the fuck?

3716
03:09:56,120 --> 03:09:57,500
What is the range?

3717
03:09:59,300 --> 03:10:01,640
What the fuck was that range?

3718
03:10:05,240 --> 03:10:07,180
Okay, that was bullshit though.

3719
03:10:07,540 --> 03:10:09,440
That was absolutely bullshit.

3720
03:10:10,340 --> 03:10:11,400
And where do I go?

3721
03:10:13,200 --> 03:10:13,720
What?

3722
03:10:15,820 --> 03:10:16,580
Oh.

3723
03:10:18,340 --> 03:10:19,600
Supposed to go down.

3724
03:10:21,240 --> 03:10:23,520
Okay, there's too many anchors.

3725
03:10:23,940 --> 03:10:25,040
I'm getting disoriented.

3726
03:10:28,410 --> 03:10:30,210
Okay, and then we got shortcut.

3727
03:10:32,010 --> 03:10:32,770
Shortcut.

3728
03:10:33,770 --> 03:10:35,010
How did you get there?

3729
03:10:35,010 --> 03:10:36,250
Why didn't you open the lever?

3730
03:10:36,910 --> 03:10:37,610
What the fuck?

3731
03:10:40,770 --> 03:10:42,390
You could've opened the lever!

3732
03:10:43,690 --> 03:10:45,110
Dang, the weather sure is rough here.

3733
03:10:45,790 --> 03:10:47,670
The wind's just howling through my pipes.

3734
03:10:48,170 --> 03:10:52,550
Still, a bit of bad weather's never deterred me before, especially with a beast so close now.

3735
03:10:53,210 --> 03:10:54,230
I wonder what it looks like.

3736
03:10:54,650 --> 03:10:57,790
Based on what the crow said, it sounds like a proper monster.

3737
03:10:58,510 --> 03:10:59,750
All hairy and wild.

3738
03:11:00,050 --> 03:11:01,670
I can't wait to see you fight it.

3739
03:11:06,130 --> 03:11:11,210
I literally had to fucking go through so many hooks to get there.

3740
03:11:11,470 --> 03:11:13,290
Sorry to tap out.

3741
03:11:17,730 --> 03:11:21,810
Oh, elevator.

3742
03:11:22,630 --> 03:11:24,570
I was a little confused.

3743
03:11:25,930 --> 03:11:28,470
Okay, that's another shortcut I have to open soon.

3744
03:11:31,390 --> 03:11:32,030
Bomb!

3745
03:11:32,030 --> 03:11:32,130
Bomb!

3746
03:11:33,690 --> 03:11:34,430
Boom!

3747
03:11:38,590 --> 03:11:39,350
Whoops.

3748
03:11:43,110 --> 03:11:45,890
I forgot about the platforms.

3749
03:11:47,490 --> 03:11:48,650
My bad.

3750
03:11:50,490 --> 03:11:51,750
There's no way he can fly.

3751
03:11:52,850 --> 03:11:55,310
I refuse to believe he can fly.

3752
03:11:55,950 --> 03:11:58,550
If I can't fly, who gave him rights to fly?

3753
03:12:02,390 --> 03:12:03,110
What?

3754
03:12:06,010 --> 03:12:07,490
Can I get down from there?

3755
03:12:09,490 --> 03:12:11,630
I'm trying to feel like...

3756
03:12:11,630 --> 03:12:12,310
Oh, okay.

3757
03:12:13,490 --> 03:12:15,170
I'm trying to figure out where this would take me.

3758
03:12:19,190 --> 03:12:19,670
Okay.

3759
03:12:21,170 --> 03:12:22,550
Where does that take me?

3760
03:12:22,870 --> 03:12:24,030
Oh, it just takes me back.

3761
03:12:24,850 --> 03:12:25,930
How do I get up there?

3762
03:12:27,210 --> 03:12:29,350
I don't need that child anyway, nevermind.

3763
03:12:32,470 --> 03:12:33,810
We don't need that child.

3764
03:12:39,030 --> 03:12:40,030
Oh, no.

3765
03:12:40,270 --> 03:12:40,690
Not again.

3766
03:12:50,580 --> 03:12:51,840
That's not fair.

3767
03:12:53,100 --> 03:12:54,400
It's not fair.

3768
03:12:54,840 --> 03:12:55,840
It's not fair.

3769
03:12:57,340 --> 03:12:58,720
Come on, get through that laser.

3770
03:12:59,960 --> 03:13:00,340
Nice.

3771
03:13:02,660 --> 03:13:03,420
What?

3772
03:13:04,900 --> 03:13:06,560
There's another one?

3773
03:13:13,090 --> 03:13:14,130
Oh, I missed.

3774
03:13:14,130 --> 03:13:15,690
Oh.

3775
03:13:17,790 --> 03:13:18,610
Nice.

3776
03:13:18,930 --> 03:13:19,370
I did it.

3777
03:13:19,450 --> 03:13:20,290
Wait, there's more?

3778
03:13:22,290 --> 03:13:24,350
This is not fair.

3779
03:13:26,850 --> 03:13:28,250
This is not fair.

3780
03:13:30,710 --> 03:13:31,950
I didn't consent.

3781
03:13:34,450 --> 03:13:36,010
What hit me?

3782
03:13:38,530 --> 03:13:39,350
What?

3783
03:13:40,170 --> 03:13:43,210
It exploded in my fucking hands?

3784
03:13:44,130 --> 03:13:45,730
What the fuck hit me?

3785
03:13:48,450 --> 03:13:49,610
Like, what?

3786
03:13:51,230 --> 03:13:52,570
I don't understand.

3787
03:13:52,890 --> 03:13:53,950
How did that happen?

3788
03:13:57,270 --> 03:13:59,330
Like, I got a heart attack?

3789
03:14:03,120 --> 03:14:05,960
How the fuck did that hit me?

3790
03:14:09,280 --> 03:14:10,160
I'm just running.

3791
03:14:10,400 --> 03:14:11,060
Fuck this.

3792
03:14:13,000 --> 03:14:15,860
I'm running, but I'll kill that one guy because I hate him.

3793
03:14:21,370 --> 03:14:22,590
Oh my god, no.

3794
03:14:22,950 --> 03:14:23,370
Oops, yeah.

3795
03:14:31,370 --> 03:14:31,930
Okay.

3796
03:14:33,370 --> 03:14:34,290
That worked.

3797
03:14:36,950 --> 03:14:37,190
Oh.

3798
03:14:38,010 --> 03:14:38,990
Oh my god.

3799
03:14:40,210 --> 03:14:40,810
Come here!

3800
03:14:44,780 --> 03:14:45,900
Not fair!

3801
03:14:50,090 --> 03:14:52,070
Oh my god, what?

3802
03:14:52,310 --> 03:14:52,610
What?

3803
03:14:52,790 --> 03:14:54,050
I got combo'd!

3804
03:14:56,990 --> 03:14:58,150
That should be legal!

3805
03:15:02,190 --> 03:15:03,610
Comboing is not allowed.

3806
03:15:08,330 --> 03:15:09,130
What?

3807
03:15:13,590 --> 03:15:15,110
Everybody's out to get me.

3808
03:15:16,030 --> 03:15:17,850
Everybody's out to get me.

3809
03:15:24,190 --> 03:15:27,070
I hit and swing and died.

3810
03:15:31,690 --> 03:15:32,530
Okay.

3811
03:15:32,670 --> 03:15:34,270
I know how to get there fast.

3812
03:15:34,710 --> 03:15:36,410
Guys, I'm not throwing.

3813
03:15:37,070 --> 03:15:39,150
It's just, they did illegal stuff.

3814
03:15:42,140 --> 03:15:43,720
I'm not throwing.

3815
03:15:47,400 --> 03:15:49,920
They did an illegal move.

3816
03:15:51,340 --> 03:15:54,240
It was illegal, I swear to god.

3817
03:15:55,280 --> 03:15:57,700
I refuse to believe it.

3818
03:15:59,120 --> 03:16:00,000
Oh my god.

3819
03:16:00,040 --> 03:16:01,980
Oh my god, I almost forgot to do the one most important thing.

3820
03:16:11,680 --> 03:16:12,500
It's fine.

3821
03:16:13,340 --> 03:16:13,980
Fuck!

3822
03:16:14,280 --> 03:16:14,880
What?

3823
03:16:15,080 --> 03:16:16,540
He i-framed it?

3824
03:16:16,720 --> 03:16:18,120
He can do that?

3825
03:16:20,520 --> 03:16:22,160
What the fuck?

3826
03:16:22,520 --> 03:16:24,360
He literally i-framed it!

3827
03:16:26,280 --> 03:16:27,420
That's crazy.

3828
03:16:29,320 --> 03:16:31,660
I didn't even realize that is allowed.

3829
03:16:33,260 --> 03:16:33,860
Wait.

3830
03:16:34,140 --> 03:16:35,360
I remembered that.

3831
03:16:36,340 --> 03:16:38,820
The last time I did that, I almost killed myself.

3832
03:16:46,650 --> 03:16:47,770
Jesus Christ.

3833
03:16:55,730 --> 03:16:57,470
Oh my god, get out of here.

3834
03:16:58,850 --> 03:16:59,890
Get out of here.

3835
03:17:01,210 --> 03:17:02,410
Get out of here.

3836
03:17:06,360 --> 03:17:07,260
Get out of here.

3837
03:17:07,280 --> 03:17:08,020
I see you!

3838
03:17:09,200 --> 03:17:10,580
Get out of here!

3839
03:17:11,860 --> 03:17:12,800
God reads.

3840
03:17:16,540 --> 03:17:18,600
When did these guys know to i-frame?

3841
03:17:20,500 --> 03:17:22,860
Who gave them rights to do that?

3842
03:17:23,540 --> 03:17:24,460
They're not crows.

3843
03:17:27,890 --> 03:17:28,570
Shit.

3844
03:17:30,530 --> 03:17:31,330
Shit.

3845
03:17:32,090 --> 03:17:32,950
Oh my god.

3846
03:17:34,670 --> 03:17:35,390
Boom.

3847
03:17:37,570 --> 03:17:40,390
How did I- Oh my god.

3848
03:17:41,690 --> 03:17:42,850
He ran into it.

3849
03:17:43,650 --> 03:17:45,530
I'm so stupid.

3850
03:17:46,430 --> 03:17:49,710
I accidentally rolled into the hammer.

3851
03:17:50,070 --> 03:17:53,850
I dodged the fucking magic to roll into it.

3852
03:17:58,870 --> 03:18:00,070
Oh my god.

3853
03:18:00,330 --> 03:18:05,050
I almost- I got killed by a grunt.

3854
03:18:05,730 --> 03:18:07,890
Oh, woe is me.

3855
03:18:10,530 --> 03:18:14,590
How far I've fallen, dying to a grunt.

3856
03:18:16,030 --> 03:18:18,530
I've fallen so far.

3857
03:18:19,570 --> 03:18:21,350
And then I miss.

3858
03:18:23,430 --> 03:18:24,230
There we go.

3859
03:18:24,610 --> 03:18:25,710
I didn't miss that, though.

3860
03:18:30,840 --> 03:18:31,180
What?

3861
03:18:32,580 --> 03:18:34,520
I don't want to run across.

3862
03:18:34,920 --> 03:18:36,460
Oh, it has range.

3863
03:18:38,340 --> 03:18:38,640
Okay.

3864
03:18:39,640 --> 03:18:40,320
Okay.

3865
03:18:41,100 --> 03:18:41,420
Aww.

3866
03:18:46,090 --> 03:18:46,770
Okay.

3867
03:18:46,770 --> 03:18:47,550
Okay.

3868
03:18:49,870 --> 03:18:50,310
No.

3869
03:18:50,630 --> 03:18:50,890
No.

3870
03:18:51,050 --> 03:18:51,110
No.

3871
03:18:51,150 --> 03:18:51,290
No.

3872
03:18:51,290 --> 03:18:51,510
No.

3873
03:18:59,450 --> 03:18:59,890
Okay.

3874
03:19:04,610 --> 03:19:05,050
Okay.

3875
03:19:07,270 --> 03:19:08,330
Okay, he doesn't know.

3876
03:19:09,610 --> 03:19:12,110
Okay, this is a little- Do I have children down?

3877
03:19:12,210 --> 03:19:13,490
I have children down there, I remembered.

3878
03:19:14,330 --> 03:19:15,790
I'm not doing this again, guys.

3879
03:19:15,790 --> 03:19:16,950
I have children down there.

3880
03:19:18,510 --> 03:19:20,630
I remember I planted seeds.

3881
03:19:22,470 --> 03:19:23,650
Where are the kids?

3882
03:19:24,670 --> 03:19:26,130
Kids, I know you exist.

3883
03:19:26,890 --> 03:19:28,190
Where are you?

3884
03:19:28,750 --> 03:19:29,490
There you go.

3885
03:19:30,550 --> 03:19:32,910
I refuse to run all the way back there.

3886
03:19:33,350 --> 03:19:34,310
I refuse.

3887
03:19:35,710 --> 03:19:36,910
Alright, nice.

3888
03:19:38,890 --> 03:19:40,270
I was not gonna do that.

3889
03:19:43,370 --> 03:19:45,190
I'm not a coward.

3890
03:19:45,450 --> 03:19:48,950
I'm just taking my fight strategically, guys.

3891
03:19:49,390 --> 03:19:51,650
It's all about strategy.

3892
03:19:53,610 --> 03:19:55,610
Okay, now I'm full HP again.

3893
03:20:00,450 --> 03:20:00,810
Okay.

3894
03:20:02,230 --> 03:20:02,950
Okay.

3895
03:20:05,850 --> 03:20:08,870
That's actually- Okay, I'm gonna say it.

3896
03:20:09,430 --> 03:20:11,070
That was bullshit.

3897
03:20:14,050 --> 03:20:20,110
That was actually- What the fuck?

3898
03:20:21,270 --> 03:20:28,070
Mid-fuck- Mid-fucking hook, he fucking slaps me.

3899
03:20:28,210 --> 03:20:28,750
Okay.

3900
03:20:29,470 --> 03:20:30,630
Okay.

3901
03:20:33,210 --> 03:20:34,450
I need to plant that.

3902
03:20:35,490 --> 03:20:37,590
I got hit mid-hook.

3903
03:20:38,890 --> 03:20:41,370
That doesn't seem so fair.

3904
03:20:43,550 --> 03:20:45,350
And I didn't realize how to get here.

3905
03:20:48,390 --> 03:20:49,450
Is that a hook?

3906
03:20:50,710 --> 03:20:51,670
I can.

3907
03:20:52,610 --> 03:20:54,670
What do I do over there?

3908
03:20:55,670 --> 03:20:57,090
Well, time to find out.

3909
03:21:00,090 --> 03:21:01,350
Where's this taking me?

3910
03:21:01,430 --> 03:21:02,670
Oh my god.

3911
03:21:03,390 --> 03:21:05,190
It took me back?

3912
03:21:11,240 --> 03:21:11,880
What?

3913
03:21:14,660 --> 03:21:16,880
Where am I?

3914
03:21:21,680 --> 03:21:22,440
Okay.

3915
03:21:23,280 --> 03:21:23,600
Okay.

3916
03:21:24,060 --> 03:21:25,440
Okay, I- Okay.

3917
03:21:27,180 --> 03:21:28,460
Kids, I'm mad.

3918
03:21:29,240 --> 03:21:30,220
Follow me, kids.

3919
03:21:30,340 --> 03:21:30,920
I'm mad.

3920
03:21:31,300 --> 03:21:33,000
Follow me, children.

3921
03:21:34,160 --> 03:21:36,120
Croquis needs to take her anger out.

3922
03:21:41,320 --> 03:21:42,840
I'm not mad anymore.

3923
03:21:44,860 --> 03:21:45,240
No!

3924
03:21:49,500 --> 03:21:51,120
Fatherhood is so hard.

3925
03:21:56,260 --> 03:21:58,480
Croquis hates backtracking.

3926
03:22:02,880 --> 03:22:04,640
Okay, where's it here now?

3927
03:22:06,040 --> 03:22:06,960
Is this a slippy slide?

3928
03:22:07,140 --> 03:22:07,640
It is.

3929
03:22:07,780 --> 03:22:08,680
Okay, a slippy slide.

3930
03:22:10,380 --> 03:22:11,480
Oh my god.

3931
03:22:12,240 --> 03:22:13,040
Slippy slide.

3932
03:22:16,890 --> 03:22:17,530
Boom!

3933
03:22:20,530 --> 03:22:22,910
Oh god, not the slippy slide.

3934
03:22:26,580 --> 03:22:27,280
Alright.

3935
03:22:27,860 --> 03:22:31,120
I'm just gonna- Oh, he's crying like a bitch.

3936
03:22:33,640 --> 03:22:34,900
Okay, this way.

3937
03:22:39,060 --> 03:22:39,680
Okay.

3938
03:22:40,660 --> 03:22:41,240
Oh, fuck.

3939
03:22:41,880 --> 03:22:43,280
Oh, we have to be fast.

3940
03:22:45,720 --> 03:22:46,060
Oh!

3941
03:22:48,100 --> 03:22:48,800
Oh!

3942
03:22:49,980 --> 03:22:51,260
Fast as fuck!

3943
03:22:55,290 --> 03:22:57,610
Jesus Christ!

3944
03:22:57,710 --> 03:22:59,170
Get back here!

3945
03:22:59,270 --> 03:23:01,470
I shall slide my way to victory!

3946
03:23:04,030 --> 03:23:04,870
Okay.

3947
03:23:06,370 --> 03:23:07,550
Oh my god.

3948
03:23:07,970 --> 03:23:09,470
Oh my god, fuck!

3949
03:23:17,360 --> 03:23:18,200
Oh

3950
03:23:22,450 --> 03:23:24,010
my god, I hate this.

3951
03:23:24,490 --> 03:23:30,170
I hate- Get me outta here!

3952
03:23:31,790 --> 03:23:32,450
Holy fuck.

3953
03:23:32,570 --> 03:23:34,030
They only give me eight souls!

3954
03:23:34,270 --> 03:23:35,850
Like, that's not- Oh god.

3955
03:23:36,030 --> 03:23:37,130
I almost died off.

3956
03:23:41,580 --> 03:23:45,360
They give me like, eight souls too, like the big boys.

3957
03:23:46,360 --> 03:23:47,220
That's crazy.

3958
03:23:47,360 --> 03:23:54,440
That is- If it takes me like, four Kamehamehas to fucking kill them, it should not take me eight- It should not give me eight souls.

3959
03:23:58,000 --> 03:23:58,440
Alright.

3960
03:23:58,440 --> 03:23:58,680
Alright.

3961
03:23:59,620 --> 03:24:00,660
Off we go.

3962
03:24:01,260 --> 03:24:02,800
We unlock this area.

3963
03:24:06,000 --> 03:24:06,320
Okay.

3964
03:24:06,620 --> 03:24:07,900
Oh, this looks dangerous.

3965
03:24:11,000 --> 03:24:14,680
I have a feeling a lot of stuff are- Oh, there we go!

3966
03:24:15,860 --> 03:24:22,460
Yeah, it definitely- Yeah, that definitely looked dan- Oh wait, but they're little minions, so it should be fine.

3967
03:24:22,580 --> 03:24:23,380
Oh my god.

3968
03:24:23,680 --> 03:24:28,460
I didn't remember that I cannot Kamehameha like, next to them.

3969
03:24:29,940 --> 03:24:31,780
That's a stupid thing to do.

3970
03:24:33,980 --> 03:24:34,660
Okay.

3971
03:24:37,100 --> 03:24:38,600
Come on, get close to me!

3972
03:24:41,040 --> 03:24:42,560
Come on, get over here!

3973
03:24:45,840 --> 03:24:47,160
Jesus Christ.

3974
03:24:47,860 --> 03:24:51,200
Oh my god, I'm just sliding everywhere!

3975
03:24:52,140 --> 03:24:54,060
I- Where is it?!

3976
03:24:58,330 --> 03:24:59,070
Oh my god.

3977
03:25:00,210 --> 03:25:01,710
Oh my god!

3978
03:25:02,890 --> 03:25:03,570
Okay.

3979
03:25:04,470 --> 03:25:05,550
Okay, there we go.

3980
03:25:06,690 --> 03:25:06,890
Yeah!

3981
03:25:07,030 --> 03:25:08,210
Oh fuck, and I missed.

3982
03:25:09,670 --> 03:25:11,030
There's more?!

3983
03:25:11,030 --> 03:25:11,410
Oh!

3984
03:25:13,130 --> 03:25:13,810
Oh!

3985
03:25:16,150 --> 03:25:17,990
Do you mean?!

3986
03:25:19,770 --> 03:25:21,230
Okay, I need to get the plants.

3987
03:25:24,990 --> 03:25:25,310
Okay.

3988
03:25:26,210 --> 03:25:26,450
Oh!

3989
03:25:44,380 --> 03:25:47,900
I keep forgetting physics!

3990
03:25:48,440 --> 03:25:50,020
I keep forgetting!

3991
03:25:59,120 --> 03:26:00,520
Why?!

3992
03:26:00,520 --> 03:26:04,060
Why does physics exist?!

3993
03:26:06,440 --> 03:26:09,520
This should be against all rules.

3994
03:26:10,340 --> 03:26:12,500
They're gonna follow me?!

3995
03:26:12,500 --> 03:26:14,240
Get outta here!

3996
03:26:15,660 --> 03:26:16,480
Okay.

3997
03:26:16,480 --> 03:26:16,600
Okay.

3998
03:26:16,860 --> 03:26:18,640
I'm just gonna use my kamihalas.

3999
03:26:24,130 --> 03:26:25,390
I feel like-

4000
03:26:30,810 --> 03:26:31,330
What?!

4001
03:26:31,330 --> 03:26:32,110
Okay.

4002
03:26:33,870 --> 03:26:34,870
Okay, nice.

4003
03:26:36,110 --> 03:26:38,270
I'm just gonna be up here for a bit.

4004
03:26:39,850 --> 03:26:41,710
And then I'll beat this guy up.

4005
03:26:43,450 --> 03:26:43,970
Okay.

4006
03:26:47,010 --> 03:26:48,350
Okay, we got one of them.

4007
03:26:49,390 --> 03:26:50,710
Okay, let's get the other one.

4008
03:26:53,090 --> 03:26:53,830
Okay.

4009
03:26:53,830 --> 03:26:54,290
Oh my god.

4010
03:26:55,150 --> 03:26:56,710
Oh my god.

4011
03:26:56,750 --> 03:26:58,800
Oh, I hate these little guys!

4012
03:27:02,590 --> 03:27:05,370
Get these little guys outta here!

4013
03:27:08,370 --> 03:27:09,110
Okay.

4014
03:27:10,610 --> 03:27:12,170
Get the plants first.

4015
03:27:12,930 --> 03:27:14,820
Why does physics not affect the plants?!

4016
03:27:17,110 --> 03:27:18,490
Not fair!

4017
03:27:18,490 --> 03:27:18,570
Not fair!

4018
03:27:25,300 --> 03:27:25,980
Oh shit.

4019
03:27:27,660 --> 03:27:28,940
Okay, it's fine.

4020
03:27:30,420 --> 03:27:32,340
He's too far away to get me.

4021
03:27:32,880 --> 03:27:34,100
Okay, he jumped closer.

4022
03:27:35,300 --> 03:27:37,940
It's not that far away anymore.

4023
03:27:41,400 --> 03:27:42,140
It's fine.

4024
03:27:42,380 --> 03:27:43,420
I got this.

4025
03:27:47,210 --> 03:27:47,970
It's fine.

4026
03:27:50,850 --> 03:27:51,610
Boom!

4027
03:27:51,610 --> 03:27:53,090
That's right!

4028
03:27:53,090 --> 03:27:55,230
I'm on top of- Oh, there's more?!

4029
03:27:55,230 --> 03:27:59,730
There's more?!

4030
03:27:59,730 --> 03:28:01,710
What do you mean?

4031
03:28:02,290 --> 03:28:02,770
What do you-

4032
03:28:06,010 --> 03:28:08,730
What do you mean by that?!

4033
03:28:08,730 --> 03:28:11,610
What do you mean there's more?!

4034
03:28:13,290 --> 03:28:14,630
Oh my god.

4035
03:28:15,590 --> 03:28:16,630
There's more!

4036
03:28:17,950 --> 03:28:18,390
Alright.

4037
03:28:21,670 --> 03:28:23,690
Oh my god, get up the stairs, please!

4038
03:28:24,070 --> 03:28:25,750
Please, for the love of god, get up the stairs!

4039
03:28:29,830 --> 03:28:30,270
Please!

4040
03:28:31,350 --> 03:28:34,310
My entire strategy relies on you to walk up the stairs!

4041
03:28:38,670 --> 03:28:40,670
They don't know how to walk up!

4042
03:28:48,060 --> 03:28:48,500
Alright.

4043
03:28:48,500 --> 03:28:49,380
Okay, that's fine.

4044
03:28:50,800 --> 03:28:51,560
That's fine.

4045
03:28:51,640 --> 03:28:53,140
Oh, fuck, that's not fine.

4046
03:28:55,760 --> 03:28:56,280
Woo!

4047
03:28:58,480 --> 03:29:00,000
Wait, wait, that's the stairs.

4048
03:29:00,360 --> 03:29:05,380
I almost- I almost used it on the fucking stairs.

4049
03:29:05,760 --> 03:29:07,520
Oh, that would've been so bad.

4050
03:29:08,280 --> 03:29:10,260
That actually would've been- No, no!

4051
03:29:10,500 --> 03:29:12,080
I almost slid into it!

4052
03:29:14,300 --> 03:29:15,740
I learned my lesson.

4053
03:29:17,040 --> 03:29:17,900
Not again.

4054
03:29:19,500 --> 03:29:21,060
Okay, there you go.

4055
03:29:22,140 --> 03:29:23,700
I didn't trust myself.

4056
03:29:25,840 --> 03:29:27,480
Oh my god, that was a lot.

4057
03:29:28,500 --> 03:29:30,220
I wish I had that plus one HP.

4058
03:29:31,360 --> 03:29:33,720
Wish I found that other shrine.

4059
03:29:34,720 --> 03:29:35,500
Guess not.

4060
03:29:36,260 --> 03:29:37,420
Rookie never learns.

4061
03:29:38,300 --> 03:29:38,780
Children.

4062
03:29:40,100 --> 03:29:40,780
Seaplant.

4063
03:29:41,640 --> 03:29:42,320
Consume.

4064
03:29:45,950 --> 03:29:46,630
Hello.

4065
03:29:47,350 --> 03:29:48,110
This is it!

4066
03:29:48,650 --> 03:29:49,650
That's the beast!

4067
03:29:50,330 --> 03:29:51,730
Oh boy, my heart is pounding!

4068
03:29:52,910 --> 03:29:53,870
Are you gonna fight it?

4069
03:29:54,270 --> 03:29:57,370
I'm gonna stay way out of the way and take notes for the song.

4070
03:29:57,550 --> 03:29:58,210
Good luck!

4071
03:30:00,710 --> 03:30:01,670
Okay, I'm ready.

4072
03:30:02,190 --> 03:30:03,090
I'm so ready.

4073
03:30:03,890 --> 03:30:07,530
After fighting all those little monsters, I think that shows I'm ready.

4074
03:30:08,810 --> 03:30:10,370
But he looks so nice.

4075
03:30:12,790 --> 03:30:13,990
Look, he smiled.

4076
03:30:13,990 --> 03:30:14,130
Look.

4077
03:30:15,610 --> 03:30:16,250
Betty.

4078
03:30:16,590 --> 03:30:17,890
Oh, her name's Betty!

4079
03:30:18,170 --> 03:30:20,150
He's not... Betty's not nice.

4080
03:30:21,010 --> 03:30:22,050
Betty's not nice.

4081
03:30:22,170 --> 03:30:22,950
Betty wants to kill.

4082
03:30:24,370 --> 03:30:25,490
Betty hungers.

4083
03:30:26,370 --> 03:30:28,110
Oh, Betty's hungers!

4084
03:30:30,030 --> 03:30:31,430
Oh, shit!

4085
03:30:31,710 --> 03:30:32,770
What the...

4086
03:30:32,770 --> 03:30:34,630
What the...

4087
03:30:35,310 --> 03:30:36,930
What the fuck?

4088
03:30:38,170 --> 03:30:38,810
How?

4089
03:30:44,010 --> 03:30:45,690
Oh my god, I don't know!

4090
03:30:47,470 --> 03:30:48,170
I don't know!

4091
03:30:51,820 --> 03:30:52,040
Oh!

4092
03:30:57,560 --> 03:30:59,480
Okay, I'm scared.

4093
03:31:00,300 --> 03:31:01,520
I'm actually scared.

4094
03:31:04,380 --> 03:31:05,640
She's so strong.

4095
03:31:07,520 --> 03:31:07,880
Oh!

4096
03:31:09,940 --> 03:31:11,120
I have to...

4097
03:31:11,120 --> 03:31:13,040
I think I just have to dodge whenever she runs.

4098
03:31:15,480 --> 03:31:16,140
Okay.

4099
03:31:18,620 --> 03:31:20,820
Oh my god, she throws snowballs too?

4100
03:31:20,820 --> 03:31:20,900
Oh!

4101
03:31:26,000 --> 03:31:26,800
Holy fuck!

4102
03:31:26,860 --> 03:31:27,260
I'm dead.

4103
03:31:27,740 --> 03:31:28,680
I'm so dead.

4104
03:31:29,860 --> 03:31:30,980
I'm so dead!

4105
03:31:31,120 --> 03:31:32,280
Oh my god!

4106
03:31:34,500 --> 03:31:37,860
She, like, bounces too, so I have to, like, do the double dodge.

4107
03:31:42,920 --> 03:31:45,920
Okay, that's, like, a moment I can actually...

4108
03:31:45,920 --> 03:31:48,160
I'm trying to, like, figure out when I can attack too.

4109
03:31:49,060 --> 03:31:49,420
What?

4110
03:31:49,420 --> 03:31:50,340
Oh!

4111
03:31:51,280 --> 03:31:52,680
No, I'm fucking dead.

4112
03:31:53,040 --> 03:31:53,860
There's no way.

4113
03:31:57,840 --> 03:31:58,980
Oh, what?

4114
03:31:59,160 --> 03:31:59,760
Wait, what?

4115
03:32:00,620 --> 03:32:01,700
That's it?

4116
03:32:02,340 --> 03:32:03,100
What?

4117
03:32:04,400 --> 03:32:07,780
That was the easiest first try!

4118
03:32:08,180 --> 03:32:11,280
How can Betty be the easiest?

4119
03:32:13,460 --> 03:32:14,780
Wait, what?

4120
03:32:17,840 --> 03:32:20,600
Betty was the easiest one of them all.

4121
03:32:21,100 --> 03:32:26,840
Well, we gathered here to mourn the passing of Betty.

4122
03:32:28,140 --> 03:32:29,660
To some, she was revered as a...

4123
03:32:29,660 --> 03:32:32,740
Wait, how are the free crows gonna get betting now?

4124
03:32:33,080 --> 03:32:33,800
How are they gonna...

4125
03:32:34,520 --> 03:32:36,720
Oh shit, the free crows are gonna...

4126
03:32:36,720 --> 03:32:38,700
are gonna freeze to death now.

4127
03:32:38,960 --> 03:32:40,400
To some, she was revered as a god.

4128
03:32:40,900 --> 03:32:43,300
To others, feared as a wild, untameable beast.

4129
03:32:43,780 --> 03:32:47,280
And to a small few, loved as a radiant...

4130
03:32:47,280 --> 03:32:49,580
Oh, wow, Steadhorn.

4131
03:32:50,480 --> 03:32:50,980
Wow.

4132
03:32:53,420 --> 03:32:56,760
After many lifetimes lived atop the mountain, so the...

4133
03:32:56,760 --> 03:32:57,720
Yeah, I was gonna say!

4134
03:32:58,880 --> 03:33:00,500
How are they gonna get the fur now?

4135
03:33:01,620 --> 03:33:03,260
Bow your head in remembrance, Betty.

4136
03:33:03,780 --> 03:33:05,120
Pay your last respects.

4137
03:33:05,920 --> 03:33:07,620
Our time in this world is over.

4138
03:33:08,380 --> 03:33:10,040
Oh my God, Stonehead, you freak.

4139
03:33:10,740 --> 03:33:12,020
You freak.

4140
03:33:12,620 --> 03:33:15,280
Oh, that's where all the crows...

4141
03:33:15,280 --> 03:33:16,940
These were the crow sacrifices.

4142
03:33:17,860 --> 03:33:19,920
Remember, demonic souls anger quelled Reaper.

4143
03:33:20,520 --> 03:33:21,980
May he find peace in death.

4144
03:33:22,100 --> 03:33:22,700
I did it!

4145
03:33:22,760 --> 03:33:23,680
You wanna make a sign?

4146
03:33:24,700 --> 03:33:25,640
Betty got booped.

4147
03:33:25,800 --> 03:33:28,000
Not so dead, but thank you for the super chat.

4148
03:33:28,080 --> 03:33:28,900
Thank you, thank you.

4149
03:33:29,380 --> 03:33:31,680
What an incredible adventure this has been.

4150
03:33:31,980 --> 03:33:33,840
Full of twists and turns.

4151
03:33:34,620 --> 03:33:36,560
So Betty and the beast were one and the same?

4152
03:33:37,080 --> 03:33:37,560
Amazing!

4153
03:33:38,400 --> 03:33:42,500
That means the drunken guy that's trying to steal her, was he in love with the beast?

4154
03:33:43,140 --> 03:33:43,700
Whoa.

4155
03:33:44,860 --> 03:33:46,780
I kinda feel bad for both of them now.

4156
03:33:47,580 --> 03:33:48,580
Dead or heartbroken?

4157
03:33:49,220 --> 03:33:49,720
What you think?

4158
03:33:49,840 --> 03:33:51,040
Oh my God!

4159
03:33:52,160 --> 03:33:54,280
That guy at the drunken ceiling?

4160
03:33:54,920 --> 03:33:56,700
It was a fucking...

4161
03:33:56,700 --> 03:33:57,220
Wow!

4162
03:33:57,660 --> 03:33:58,380
He likes...

4163
03:33:58,380 --> 03:33:59,640
He likes big women.

4164
03:34:00,740 --> 03:34:02,040
They're both kinda tragic.

4165
03:34:03,080 --> 03:34:05,100
Still, it's great material for a song, huh?

4166
03:34:05,320 --> 03:34:07,300
I'm gonna write... start writing straight away.

4167
03:34:07,780 --> 03:34:09,040
I like him big.

4168
03:34:09,380 --> 03:34:10,740
I like him chunky.

4169
03:34:11,540 --> 03:34:15,060
I actually have the Madagascar...

4170
03:34:15,060 --> 03:34:16,800
Was it 3 or 2?

4171
03:34:17,500 --> 03:34:18,260
I don't remember.

4172
03:34:18,400 --> 03:34:20,060
It's Escape to Africa soundtrack.

4173
03:34:20,400 --> 03:34:20,920
Oh, it's 2.

4174
03:34:21,280 --> 03:34:25,580
I have the physical copy of the Madagascar 2 soundtrack.

4175
03:34:26,140 --> 03:34:29,300
And I have the full song of that...

4176
03:34:29,300 --> 03:34:29,660
What is it?

4177
03:34:29,660 --> 03:34:31,560
I like him big on my iPhone.

4178
03:34:35,780 --> 03:34:37,380
Sometime, and I'll play it for you.

4179
03:34:39,600 --> 03:34:40,600
Alright, nice.

4180
03:34:40,800 --> 03:34:41,620
I killed Betty.

4181
03:34:43,140 --> 03:34:44,400
I like him big.

4182
03:34:44,820 --> 03:34:47,160
I like him chunky, chunky.

4183
03:34:47,480 --> 03:34:48,460
I like him big.

4184
03:34:49,860 --> 03:34:51,120
Of course, she does.

4185
03:34:51,200 --> 03:34:53,200
Yeah, I used to be a soundtrack owner.

4186
03:34:53,380 --> 03:34:55,520
I buy, like, movie soundtracks all the time.

4187
03:34:55,980 --> 03:34:57,760
Back then, when I was a little bird.

4188
03:34:58,180 --> 03:34:58,700
I don't know why.

4189
03:35:00,140 --> 03:35:04,420
I would go to HMV and just buy soundtracks.

4190
03:35:05,560 --> 03:35:06,260
Can I upgrade?

4191
03:35:06,260 --> 03:35:06,520
Can I upgrade?

4192
03:35:09,970 --> 03:35:11,910
Okay, I should get it.

4193
03:35:13,130 --> 03:35:14,490
Okay, we definitely need that.

4194
03:35:17,430 --> 03:35:18,870
Be gone, children.

4195
03:35:20,650 --> 03:35:21,930
And where do I go now?

4196
03:35:23,050 --> 03:35:23,950
Oh, back home.

4197
03:35:24,050 --> 03:35:26,230
I need to do the... I need to give the soul to them.

4198
03:35:30,390 --> 03:35:31,310
This way.

4199
03:35:34,350 --> 03:35:36,490
There has to be a faster door.

4200
03:35:38,810 --> 03:35:40,130
Maybe here?

4201
03:35:46,120 --> 03:35:47,760
Oh my god.

4202
03:35:50,200 --> 03:35:52,400
Don't tell me this is a faster way.

4203
03:35:52,500 --> 03:35:53,460
Oh my god.

4204
03:35:54,340 --> 03:35:57,220
Wait, don't tell me this is a faster way.

4205
03:35:59,340 --> 03:36:01,060
Am I strong enough now?

4206
03:36:02,860 --> 03:36:03,620
No.

4207
03:36:04,140 --> 03:36:04,900
I'm not.

4208
03:36:06,320 --> 03:36:10,320
There has to be a faster way to get to the other side.

4209
03:36:11,020 --> 03:36:12,740
Now I'm making it slower though.

4210
03:36:13,060 --> 03:36:15,040
But I'm trying to figure it out.

4211
03:36:15,940 --> 03:36:16,920
Maybe this way?

4212
03:36:19,340 --> 03:36:20,280
Maybe here?

4213
03:36:23,840 --> 03:36:25,600
I'm definitely making it slower.

4214
03:36:25,720 --> 03:36:26,260
Yeah, okay.

4215
03:36:26,460 --> 03:36:27,100
Yeah, this is.

4216
03:36:27,180 --> 03:36:27,840
Okay, thank god.

4217
03:36:28,640 --> 03:36:30,280
This is another way to get there.

4218
03:36:30,960 --> 03:36:31,960
Fucking knew it.

4219
03:36:33,180 --> 03:36:33,900
Hello, children.

4220
03:36:34,940 --> 03:36:37,000
Daddy's gonna go come back in 10 days.

4221
03:36:37,080 --> 03:36:37,540
Don't worry.

4222
03:36:37,540 --> 03:36:39,060
He wouldn't have custody of you guys.

4223
03:36:39,840 --> 03:36:41,040
Hello, I got the last soul.

4224
03:36:42,500 --> 03:36:44,020
I did my job.

4225
03:36:45,800 --> 03:36:46,420
You did it.

4226
03:36:47,020 --> 03:36:48,740
You're a much stronger reaper than I.

4227
03:36:49,380 --> 03:36:50,180
I'm a child.

4228
03:36:51,540 --> 03:36:53,820
I was born like 5 days ago.

4229
03:36:55,160 --> 03:36:57,900
I would've never taken down those giant souls alone.

4230
03:36:59,860 --> 03:37:00,940
It is time.

4231
03:37:01,060 --> 03:37:02,120
Wait, I don't even have.

4232
03:37:02,280 --> 03:37:03,180
Is that pants?

4233
03:37:03,680 --> 03:37:05,040
Or just my feathers?

4234
03:37:07,840 --> 03:37:09,720
It is time at long last.

4235
03:37:10,440 --> 03:37:13,360
Let's force this door open and finish our assignment.

4236
03:37:13,480 --> 03:37:15,100
Wait, I don't even have pants!

4237
03:37:16,780 --> 03:37:19,840
Why do the free birds get to wear clothes?

4238
03:37:20,580 --> 03:37:21,260
Do I have?

4239
03:37:21,380 --> 03:37:22,260
I have less rights.

4240
03:37:22,400 --> 03:37:23,220
Wait, no, I do.

4241
03:37:26,820 --> 03:37:28,400
It is not fair!

4242
03:37:30,500 --> 03:37:32,200
Those are a prison.

4243
03:37:34,640 --> 03:37:37,580
Are they truly free if they're not naked?

4244
03:37:37,900 --> 03:37:38,480
You're right.

4245
03:37:42,370 --> 03:37:43,450
Door open!

4246
03:37:46,960 --> 03:37:48,780
And now to the other side.

4247
03:37:49,900 --> 03:37:51,140
Alright, here I go.

4248
03:37:52,040 --> 03:37:52,920
Man, you're old.

4249
03:37:59,400 --> 03:38:00,840
Oh my god, flashback.

4250
03:38:01,020 --> 03:38:01,480
Ahh!

4251
03:38:02,220 --> 03:38:02,700
This is it.

4252
03:38:02,760 --> 03:38:06,620
This is the place beyond where no life is to be seen.

4253
03:38:10,320 --> 03:38:10,880
Uh...

4254
03:38:11,700 --> 03:38:12,260
What?

4255
03:38:12,400 --> 03:38:13,160
That's it?

4256
03:38:14,200 --> 03:38:15,280
Who's that guy?

4257
03:38:15,620 --> 03:38:16,240
Is that the Reaper?

4258
03:38:17,220 --> 03:38:18,420
Is that Death?

4259
03:38:19,440 --> 03:38:20,000
Death!

4260
03:38:22,400 --> 03:38:23,180
What's up?

4261
03:38:24,200 --> 03:38:25,840
Wait, why does he have a fanny pack?

4262
03:38:27,020 --> 03:38:29,200
Are you Death?

4263
03:38:29,880 --> 03:38:34,300
I thought Tales of the Original Reaper was just the mad ramblings of the free crows.

4264
03:38:35,240 --> 03:38:37,420
Yeah, well, I guess that's me.

4265
03:38:39,180 --> 03:38:39,900
Fucking nerd!

4266
03:38:41,020 --> 03:38:44,580
So, if you didn't know I was real, that means you're not here to rescue me, huh?

4267
03:38:46,940 --> 03:38:48,340
Uh, no, I'm sorry.

4268
03:38:48,700 --> 03:38:50,080
We're here for another purpose.

4269
03:38:50,780 --> 03:38:53,820
In fact, you might- He's just a chill guy.

4270
03:38:54,540 --> 03:38:55,860
You might be able to help us.

4271
03:38:56,880 --> 03:38:58,020
Wow, rude!

4272
03:38:59,120 --> 03:38:59,660
But alright.

4273
03:39:00,120 --> 03:39:02,660
I mean, what's a few more minutes after several centuries?

4274
03:39:03,220 --> 03:39:05,060
So why are you here, actually?

4275
03:39:05,780 --> 03:39:07,100
How did you even get here?

4276
03:39:08,860 --> 03:39:10,540
Like, what- Wait, I should be more emo.

4277
03:39:11,160 --> 03:39:14,100
We seek souls that pass through Death's- Well, your door.

4278
03:39:15,000 --> 03:39:16,220
We're service-bound Reapers.

4279
03:39:16,420 --> 03:39:17,280
We're just contractors.

4280
03:39:18,760 --> 03:39:23,120
We require those souls to finish our task and restore our stature with a commission.

4281
03:39:23,680 --> 03:39:25,360
Otherwise, we will die.

4282
03:39:26,920 --> 03:39:27,440
Oh.

4283
03:39:27,800 --> 03:39:28,320
Awkward.

4284
03:39:29,500 --> 03:39:33,840
So like, if you're looking for a soul here, then you're out of luck.

4285
03:39:35,180 --> 03:39:40,180
Any non-Corpio soul that passes through the door are absorbed into the ether.

4286
03:39:41,200 --> 03:39:44,820
Soul energy has to be recycled to create new life.

4287
03:39:45,760 --> 03:39:47,820
That's why my job was so important.

4288
03:39:48,700 --> 03:39:51,000
Not the living didn't hate me for it.

4289
03:39:51,260 --> 03:39:52,500
So it's like, whatever.

4290
03:39:57,360 --> 03:39:59,180
It's like, I guess.

4291
03:39:59,480 --> 03:40:00,080
It's whatever.

4292
03:40:02,220 --> 03:40:05,220
I used to go around reaping souls myself.

4293
03:40:05,860 --> 03:40:08,280
Then pick them up and take them beyond the veil.

4294
03:40:09,300 --> 03:40:10,700
It was so depressing.

4295
03:40:11,160 --> 03:40:12,520
Like, that's not my vibe.

4296
03:40:12,560 --> 03:40:13,260
You get it, bro?

4297
03:40:14,260 --> 03:40:15,340
Not for the souls.

4298
03:40:15,780 --> 03:40:16,640
They don't care.

4299
03:40:17,300 --> 03:40:19,500
But for the lame-wit ones, they left behind.

4300
03:40:20,780 --> 03:40:23,960
I wish I could let them know dying isn't scary.

4301
03:40:24,620 --> 03:40:26,940
It's just a cycle of life or whatever.

4302
03:40:31,210 --> 03:40:36,470
Thing is, over the vastness of time, I got very tired of that cycle.

4303
03:40:37,530 --> 03:40:41,610
Then one day, a strange being came to me with a proposition, bro.

4304
03:40:42,650 --> 03:40:45,950
That being could like, create portals pretty rad.

4305
03:40:46,530 --> 03:40:48,990
Doors to any place or world.

4306
03:40:53,030 --> 03:40:58,970
They offered to outsource the collection of souls to an automated system using one of their doors or something.

4307
03:40:59,090 --> 03:40:59,670
I don't know.

4308
03:41:00,490 --> 03:41:03,610
While it was open, it would draw in the souls of the dead.

4309
03:41:04,610 --> 03:41:07,110
A lighthouse in the shores of the ether, if you will.

4310
03:41:08,410 --> 03:41:11,730
In return for this, they asked for their lives to be extended.

4311
03:41:12,030 --> 03:41:13,370
So I was like, whatever, cool.

4312
03:41:18,830 --> 03:41:22,430
Well, actually, they like, they asked for like, immortality?

4313
03:41:22,430 --> 03:41:24,890
But like, that's impossible.

4314
03:41:26,210 --> 03:41:30,150
The souls stick around too long past their expiration date.

4315
03:41:30,610 --> 03:41:32,670
They have nothing left to tie to mortality.

4316
03:41:33,210 --> 03:41:36,810
They came to some sort of demonic form or something?

4317
03:41:37,270 --> 03:41:38,710
But I don't fucking know.

4318
03:41:39,930 --> 03:41:41,330
All life must end.

4319
03:41:43,130 --> 03:41:44,630
Well, eventually, bro.

4320
03:41:48,490 --> 03:41:56,230
So, that kicked back several generations of these like, self-proclaimed lord of doors came and went.

4321
03:41:56,990 --> 03:41:59,650
Enjoying their unnaturally long lives.

4322
03:42:00,670 --> 03:42:07,730
Each one agreeing in the end to submit to the limitations of life and go into the ether or something.

4323
03:42:08,410 --> 03:42:08,990
I don't know.

4324
03:42:12,310 --> 03:42:14,190
Until one didn't.

4325
03:42:14,470 --> 03:42:16,410
Which is pretty fucking weird if you ask me.

4326
03:42:17,310 --> 03:42:18,590
But like, who cares?

4327
03:42:18,990 --> 03:42:21,630
Which brings us to your current lord of doors.

4328
03:42:21,630 --> 03:42:30,970
Towards the end of what should have been their lifestyle, bro, your lord betrayed our long-standing agreement and that was not cool.

4329
03:42:31,350 --> 03:42:33,150
That was not chill, man.

4330
03:42:34,010 --> 03:42:36,530
They said there had been some kind of incident.

4331
03:42:37,370 --> 03:42:41,330
That the door had malfunctioned and needed to be remade new.

4332
03:42:42,690 --> 03:42:49,030
For the door to be reconstructed, it required a touch of death to link to the door to the ether.

4333
03:42:49,030 --> 03:42:50,910
Totally uncool, bro.

4334
03:42:52,110 --> 03:42:54,050
So I like went there, you know?

4335
03:42:54,490 --> 03:42:55,130
But

4336
03:42:58,690 --> 03:43:05,810
after this new door was created and opened, the lord kicked me on the side and sealed it shut.

4337
03:43:06,330 --> 03:43:07,590
Totally not rad.

4338
03:43:08,550 --> 03:43:10,190
No way for me to escape.

4339
03:43:11,090 --> 03:43:14,070
No way for stray souls to pass on to the ether.

4340
03:43:14,950 --> 03:43:17,710
Like, no death among the living.

4341
03:43:20,030 --> 03:43:21,470
Not cool, bro.

4342
03:43:22,370 --> 03:43:23,430
He looks like that.

4343
03:43:24,730 --> 03:43:27,310
You're like, what kind of voice acting is that?

4344
03:43:27,350 --> 03:43:28,390
Like, look at him!

4345
03:43:32,570 --> 03:43:34,270
Major bummer, man.

4346
03:43:40,380 --> 03:43:45,400
I've been here alone ever since.

4347
03:43:46,580 --> 03:43:47,980
Wasn't chill, bro.

4348
03:43:51,240 --> 03:43:55,900
He's literally wearing a hoodie that's just a chill bro.

4349
03:43:56,760 --> 03:43:59,340
But, my soulless soul, it must be here.

4350
03:43:59,840 --> 03:44:01,180
It has to be here.

4351
03:44:02,140 --> 03:44:03,360
Attracted to this door.

4352
03:44:04,240 --> 03:44:05,440
It must have entered here somehow.

4353
03:44:05,760 --> 03:44:07,300
Are you sure you haven't seen it?

4354
03:44:08,600 --> 03:44:09,480
Sorry, guy.

4355
03:44:10,280 --> 03:44:14,020
If a soul comes here without body, it disappears into the ether.

4356
03:44:17,340 --> 03:44:21,600
Sooner or later, everything that begins has to end, bro.

4357
03:44:23,100 --> 03:44:25,100
So, there's no hope.

4358
03:44:25,820 --> 03:44:27,460
It must still be here somewhere.

4359
03:44:29,560 --> 03:44:33,180
No, no, no, no, no!

4360
03:44:33,900 --> 03:44:36,360
I wasted so many years searching for that soul.

4361
03:44:36,820 --> 03:44:37,420
Decades!

4362
03:44:37,740 --> 03:44:39,040
Oh my god, centuries.

4363
03:44:39,180 --> 03:44:40,260
You fucking live long.

4364
03:44:40,380 --> 03:44:41,600
We have a long lifespan.

4365
03:44:43,660 --> 03:44:45,040
I refuse to die.

4366
03:44:45,760 --> 03:44:46,860
Uh oh.

4367
03:44:47,780 --> 03:44:49,060
Bro, your friend cool, man?

4368
03:44:50,660 --> 03:44:52,020
Is your friend cool?

4369
03:44:52,160 --> 03:44:55,340
Does he need like, you know...

4370
03:44:55,340 --> 03:44:57,440
Does he need help?

4371
03:44:59,100 --> 03:45:02,180
I sense you're a little bit past your before date.

4372
03:45:02,840 --> 03:45:03,920
Best before date.

4373
03:45:07,300 --> 03:45:08,460
Oh shit!

4374
03:45:08,760 --> 03:45:09,360
He's going!

4375
03:45:09,540 --> 03:45:09,820
Oh!

4376
03:45:10,560 --> 03:45:11,660
He's going feral!

4377
03:45:12,200 --> 03:45:13,460
Oh my god!

4378
03:45:15,320 --> 03:45:15,600
Bro!

4379
03:45:15,980 --> 03:45:16,420
See ya.

4380
03:45:16,720 --> 03:45:17,060
Peace.

4381
03:45:19,160 --> 03:45:20,880
What the fuck?

4382
03:45:21,700 --> 03:45:23,200
He literally went peace.

4383
03:45:25,780 --> 03:45:27,000
Oh shit!

4384
03:45:27,860 --> 03:45:29,280
What the fuck?

4385
03:45:29,760 --> 03:45:30,140
Oh!

4386
03:45:30,480 --> 03:45:31,480
What the fuck?

4387
03:45:33,120 --> 03:45:33,920
What?

4388
03:45:35,040 --> 03:45:36,520
Holy shit!

4389
03:45:36,960 --> 03:45:38,360
Okay, that's funny though.

4390
03:45:38,940 --> 03:45:41,040
I like how the...

4391
03:45:41,040 --> 03:45:41,660
I...

4392
03:45:43,680 --> 03:45:47,340
That's funny that he literally went peace, bro.

4393
03:45:48,930 --> 03:45:50,620
Oh my god!

4394
03:45:51,000 --> 03:45:52,820
Jesus Christ!

4395
03:45:53,520 --> 03:45:55,780
Okay, this guy's fucking freaky.

4396
03:45:57,980 --> 03:45:58,720
Whoa!

4397
03:45:59,620 --> 03:46:01,760
Oh my god, he's freaky!

4398
03:46:04,280 --> 03:46:05,240
It went feral!

4399
03:46:05,920 --> 03:46:07,420
It's going feral!

4400
03:46:10,180 --> 03:46:10,800
Oh!

4401
03:46:13,600 --> 03:46:13,940
Oh!

4402
03:46:15,980 --> 03:46:17,180
What the fuck?

4403
03:46:17,240 --> 03:46:17,960
That's not fair!

4404
03:46:19,140 --> 03:46:20,640
That's actually not fair!

4405
03:46:23,280 --> 03:46:24,840
Bro, he's literally dead!

4406
03:46:24,880 --> 03:46:26,420
What do you mean you ain't fighting that?

4407
03:46:27,280 --> 03:46:27,780
Death.

4408
03:46:30,960 --> 03:46:32,640
You're on your own, bro.

4409
03:46:33,460 --> 03:46:34,500
Yeah, I'll try.

4410
03:46:35,320 --> 03:46:35,800
Okay.

4411
03:46:36,600 --> 03:46:38,320
Bro, what the fuck?

4412
03:46:40,780 --> 03:46:42,220
Like, what the...

4413
03:46:42,220 --> 03:46:43,040
He just...

4414
03:46:43,040 --> 03:46:44,780
He just runs me over!

4415
03:46:45,420 --> 03:46:45,900
Bro!

4416
03:46:49,420 --> 03:46:51,600
What to do when he runs you over?

4417
03:46:57,880 --> 03:46:59,000
Oh, okay.

4418
03:46:59,060 --> 03:46:59,960
I forgot he could...

4419
03:46:59,960 --> 03:47:00,900
You know, I'll do it again.

4420
03:47:01,020 --> 03:47:01,620
Just hit me.

4421
03:47:02,060 --> 03:47:03,420
That was not a good run.

4422
03:47:03,420 --> 03:47:05,400
That was...

4423
03:47:05,400 --> 03:47:08,280
That was 11 out of fighting.

4424
03:47:08,740 --> 03:47:09,340
Okay.

4425
03:47:09,800 --> 03:47:11,440
Okay, like, I learned now.

4426
03:47:11,760 --> 03:47:12,620
I figured it out.

4427
03:47:14,220 --> 03:47:14,820
Okay.

4428
03:47:15,420 --> 03:47:18,140
I had to figure things out, guys.

4429
03:47:18,720 --> 03:47:19,120
Okay.

4430
03:47:20,600 --> 03:47:22,580
I'm just gonna use the Kamehameha.

4431
03:47:22,740 --> 03:47:23,320
The...

4432
03:47:23,320 --> 03:47:24,680
Oh my god!

4433
03:47:25,220 --> 03:47:26,320
Like, the...

4434
03:47:26,320 --> 03:47:28,260
The bomb takes too long to charge.

4435
03:47:28,560 --> 03:47:30,300
And I did not put in dexterity.

4436
03:47:31,960 --> 03:47:32,860
Jesus Christ!

4437
03:47:32,960 --> 03:47:33,420
I didn't remember.

4438
03:47:33,620 --> 03:47:34,300
I cannot...

4439
03:47:35,520 --> 03:47:36,440
Actually... Oh my god.

4440
03:47:36,460 --> 03:47:36,860
I don't know.

4441
03:47:37,960 --> 03:47:38,940
I'm trying to figure it out.

4442
03:47:39,440 --> 03:47:41,360
Because I can't do anything.

4443
03:47:42,060 --> 03:47:46,360
I guess, like, I'll fight him when he... Oh, I fight him when he...

4444
03:47:46,360 --> 03:47:47,540
when he caws.

4445
03:47:47,680 --> 03:47:47,960
Okay.

4446
03:47:49,520 --> 03:47:52,100
Because I'm like, how do I...

4447
03:47:52,640 --> 03:47:54,300
When he, like, moves...

4448
03:47:54,980 --> 03:47:56,780
I need to fight him when he starts cawing.

4449
03:48:00,300 --> 03:48:00,640
Jesus.

4450
03:48:00,840 --> 03:48:01,020
Okay.

4451
03:48:01,280 --> 03:48:02,500
Or when he does that, I guess.

4452
03:48:07,050 --> 03:48:08,010
Oh my god.

4453
03:48:08,270 --> 03:48:12,210
Oh my god.

4454
03:48:13,630 --> 03:48:14,030
Oh!

4455
03:48:19,150 --> 03:48:20,010
Oh my god.

4456
03:48:20,590 --> 03:48:22,170
Sometimes I don't know when he caws!

4457
03:48:25,990 --> 03:48:26,970
When caw!

4458
03:48:30,610 --> 03:48:32,090
Oh shit, I fucked it up.

4459
03:48:33,110 --> 03:48:34,730
Where is my body?

4460
03:48:35,830 --> 03:48:36,350
What?

4461
03:48:42,110 --> 03:48:43,190
Jesus Christ!

4462
03:48:43,250 --> 03:48:44,470
Sometimes I don't know when he caws!

4463
03:48:45,330 --> 03:48:46,590
It's not fair!

4464
03:48:50,110 --> 03:48:51,550
Okay, this is a hard...

4465
03:48:51,550 --> 03:48:52,710
This is a hard battle.

4466
03:48:52,830 --> 03:48:53,710
This is a hard battle.

4467
03:48:54,050 --> 03:48:55,670
This is absolutely a hard battle.

4468
03:48:58,490 --> 03:48:59,030
What?!

4469
03:48:59,610 --> 03:49:00,730
This is not fair.

4470
03:49:04,510 --> 03:49:05,930
Oh, this is not fair.

4471
03:49:10,560 --> 03:49:11,100
Oh!

4472
03:49:11,780 --> 03:49:12,340
Oh!

4473
03:49:13,000 --> 03:49:14,720
Oh my god, I can't...

4474
03:49:14,720 --> 03:49:16,260
I can't believe I missed that.

4475
03:49:19,200 --> 03:49:20,180
What does that do?

4476
03:49:20,820 --> 03:49:22,060
What does that do?

4477
03:49:22,260 --> 03:49:23,380
What does that do?

4478
03:49:23,480 --> 03:49:24,700
Oh, it sucks!

4479
03:49:25,700 --> 03:49:26,700
It's a sucker!

4480
03:49:28,000 --> 03:49:29,040
What the fuck?

4481
03:49:29,080 --> 03:49:30,400
Why are there many crows?

4482
03:49:32,080 --> 03:49:32,640
Oh!

4483
03:49:32,940 --> 03:49:33,500
Shit!

4484
03:49:33,500 --> 03:49:33,660
Shit!

4485
03:49:38,700 --> 03:49:40,360
Oh my god.

4486
03:49:41,560 --> 03:49:43,220
Oh, it slows me...

4487
03:49:43,220 --> 03:49:45,420
Oh, it slows me down!

4488
03:49:46,260 --> 03:49:47,360
Okay, now I know.

4489
03:49:48,560 --> 03:49:49,480
Okay, now I know.

4490
03:49:51,000 --> 03:49:52,540
I was like so confused.

4491
03:49:53,460 --> 03:49:54,700
I was like, what is it doing?

4492
03:50:02,290 --> 03:50:02,590
Okay.

4493
03:50:04,630 --> 03:50:06,150
Oh my god!

4494
03:50:06,150 --> 03:50:08,170
Get away from me!

4495
03:50:11,340 --> 03:50:12,980
We're one of the same!

4496
03:50:15,420 --> 03:50:17,040
Jesus Christ.

4497
03:50:18,660 --> 03:50:19,000
Oh!

4498
03:50:20,200 --> 03:50:21,040
Get away!

4499
03:50:30,400 --> 03:50:32,080
Oh my god.

4500
03:50:33,000 --> 03:50:34,280
This crow fight.

4501
03:50:35,660 --> 03:50:36,840
Too many crows!

4502
03:50:42,020 --> 03:50:44,060
Too many crows!

4503
03:50:48,980 --> 03:50:49,580
Oh!

4504
03:50:52,240 --> 03:50:52,840
Okay.

4505
03:50:57,720 --> 03:50:58,740
Jesus Christ.

4506
03:51:01,160 --> 03:51:03,380
Don't you hate it when there's just too many!

4507
03:51:03,480 --> 03:51:04,080
Oh, he's dead.

4508
03:51:05,340 --> 03:51:05,940
Okay.

4509
03:51:06,780 --> 03:51:07,240
Goodbye.

4510
03:51:09,500 --> 03:51:10,100
Goodbye.

4511
03:51:11,580 --> 03:51:13,880
Never go full crow, guys.

4512
03:51:15,040 --> 03:51:16,360
Bro, I can't tell you how lucky I am.

4513
03:51:16,360 --> 03:51:19,580
I don't know how long it's been since I felt a fresh breeze on my face.

4514
03:51:19,760 --> 03:51:21,420
Or like, saw well or anything.

4515
03:51:22,920 --> 03:51:25,260
Never appreciate something until it's gone, do you?

4516
03:51:25,620 --> 03:51:27,620
Is this the orphan of cause?

4517
03:51:27,860 --> 03:51:29,740
Thank you for the super chat burrito.

4518
03:51:29,840 --> 03:51:30,900
Thank you, thank you.

4519
03:51:32,460 --> 03:51:33,920
So long, Emma John.

4520
03:51:34,300 --> 03:51:38,640
But, until your lord of doors locked me up, Never thought it'd apply to me.

4521
03:51:41,340 --> 03:51:43,640
Sorry about your big feather friend back there.

4522
03:51:43,640 --> 03:51:46,960
It's always hard for the living to let go of the dead or something.

4523
03:51:47,300 --> 03:51:47,780
I don't know.

4524
03:51:47,860 --> 03:51:49,180
He wasn't pretty chill, though.

4525
03:51:49,320 --> 03:51:50,760
He was not chill at all.

4526
03:51:51,720 --> 03:51:52,960
Even more of a rough one.

4527
03:51:53,580 --> 03:51:55,300
Having to reap him yourself.

4528
03:51:56,800 --> 03:51:58,240
Seems like a bummer, bro.

4529
03:51:59,280 --> 03:52:01,360
I sort of understand that feeling.

4530
03:52:03,520 --> 03:52:07,340
Even if it was your intention, You've done me a huge favor here, crow.

4531
03:52:08,500 --> 03:52:11,120
But, This isn't over quite yet.

4532
03:52:12,480 --> 03:52:18,160
Because while the door has been destroyed, My power is unfortunately still trapped in its remains.

4533
03:52:20,240 --> 03:52:23,100
Forging a door requires a piece of my own soul.

4534
03:52:23,840 --> 03:52:26,520
And I need it back before I can do my job again.

4535
03:52:29,120 --> 03:52:30,160
That means...

4536
03:52:30,160 --> 03:52:31,620
Golly heinous, man.

4537
03:52:32,180 --> 03:52:32,680
I know.

4538
03:52:33,520 --> 03:52:38,000
If we want to end this cycle, Someone else has to take down the lord of the doors.

4539
03:52:38,820 --> 03:52:40,020
Have you guessed who yet?

4540
03:52:41,500 --> 03:52:42,980
Starts with a C.

4541
03:52:45,760 --> 03:52:48,640
I won't be making any more deals, that's for sure.

4542
03:52:49,960 --> 03:52:53,080
Head back to your office and reap your boss's soul, crow.

4543
03:52:54,840 --> 03:52:56,280
Or like, I don't know, something similar.

4544
03:52:56,840 --> 03:53:00,180
And remember, Death is on your side.

4545
03:53:00,440 --> 03:53:01,660
Bro, you peaced out!

4546
03:53:02,300 --> 03:53:04,060
What the fuck?

4547
03:53:05,120 --> 03:53:05,680
Bro!

4548
03:53:06,000 --> 03:53:07,540
I saw you peaced out!

4549
03:53:07,540 --> 03:53:10,200
Oh my god.

4550
03:53:10,240 --> 03:53:10,800
It's time.

4551
03:53:12,060 --> 03:53:12,900
Revolution!

4552
03:53:14,260 --> 03:53:15,200
No more!

4553
03:53:15,760 --> 03:53:17,780
I shall be a free bird!

4554
03:53:20,600 --> 03:53:21,920
Viva la revolution!

4555
03:53:24,280 --> 03:53:26,520
Do you hear the crows sing?

4556
03:53:27,200 --> 03:53:33,080
Do you hear the crows sing?

4557
03:53:37,540 --> 03:53:38,240
Na na na!

4558
03:53:43,760 --> 03:53:44,900
No crow!

4559
03:53:45,280 --> 03:53:47,860
No more masters for crows!

4560
03:53:49,180 --> 03:53:50,240
Crow free bird!

4561
03:53:51,400 --> 03:53:52,920
Off with his head!

4562
03:53:54,940 --> 03:53:56,340
For the crow pup!

4563
03:53:58,100 --> 03:53:59,560
Okay, we gotta go head home.

4564
03:54:00,180 --> 03:54:01,320
Wherever that is.

4565
03:54:01,640 --> 03:54:02,420
I'm so lost.

4566
03:54:02,460 --> 03:54:03,080
Oh, there's the door.

4567
03:54:04,900 --> 03:54:06,000
That's right.

4568
03:54:06,280 --> 03:54:07,480
My people!

4569
03:54:07,860 --> 03:54:09,880
I've seen a new world!

4570
03:54:11,240 --> 03:54:13,280
That's what I was about to do!

4571
03:54:13,560 --> 03:54:15,060
My fellow crows!

4572
03:54:15,400 --> 03:54:17,760
There is a world beyond work!

4573
03:54:18,980 --> 03:54:22,640
We have arrived at a moment foretold long ago.

4574
03:54:23,800 --> 03:54:30,740
Today, death's door has been opened and death is down with down with Corpo!

4575
03:54:33,520 --> 03:54:37,920
And death themselves has been freed once more into the world!

4576
03:54:38,900 --> 03:54:40,740
Down with the lords!

4577
03:54:41,140 --> 03:54:42,120
Fear not!

4578
03:54:42,580 --> 03:54:44,900
For this is not the end of days!

4579
03:54:45,300 --> 03:54:47,560
But beginning of a bright new future!

4580
03:54:48,680 --> 03:54:50,100
Viva la revolution!

4581
03:54:51,360 --> 03:54:57,820
The forces of life and death have been unnaturally thrown into chaos for a thousand years!

4582
03:54:58,300 --> 03:55:00,900
And we crows played a hand in that!

4583
03:55:03,080 --> 03:55:04,960
We must right our wrongs!

4584
03:55:05,480 --> 03:55:07,240
We must accept our fate!

4585
03:55:07,780 --> 03:55:11,460
We must reject those who lead us into the future with no hope!

4586
03:55:12,960 --> 03:55:15,900
It's time for the Lord of Doors' reign to end!

4587
03:55:16,280 --> 03:55:19,580
And for us to return to a light, natural life cycle!

4588
03:55:21,020 --> 03:55:28,820
Even as our world teeters on the edge of oblivion, souls like these four spirits still manage to emerge through the cracks.

4589
03:55:29,460 --> 03:55:34,320
Soon a new age will begin and the world will teem with new life!

4590
03:55:34,740 --> 03:55:35,620
Viva la revolution!

4591
03:55:39,240 --> 03:55:46,120
For that to happen, the final hours of this foretold day must play out as ordained!

4592
03:55:46,620 --> 03:55:50,420
The crow that freed death will have to end the Lord of Doors' reign!

4593
03:55:53,280 --> 03:55:55,820
For the crows!

4594
03:56:01,000 --> 03:56:02,100
Viva la crovulation!

4595
03:56:05,440 --> 03:56:07,660
Yes, I'd like to increase my combat, please.

4596
03:56:07,800 --> 03:56:09,000
Okay, we'll do...

4597
03:56:10,580 --> 03:56:11,420
We'll do...

4598
03:56:11,420 --> 03:56:13,320
Oh my God, I feel like...

4599
03:56:13,320 --> 03:56:14,180
Okay, we'll do magic.

4600
03:56:14,680 --> 03:56:15,960
I don't need to be that fast.

4601
03:56:16,800 --> 03:56:19,000
I know that you'll complete your task, old friend.

4602
03:56:19,880 --> 03:56:21,100
Have faith in yourself.

4603
03:56:21,220 --> 03:56:22,740
We're gonna do it, guys!

4604
03:56:22,940 --> 03:56:23,780
Stop working!

4605
03:56:25,840 --> 03:56:27,400
I hope I can find a new...

4606
03:56:27,400 --> 03:56:27,780
No!

4607
03:56:27,960 --> 03:56:29,240
We are free birds!

4608
03:56:29,240 --> 03:56:30,540
We don't need jobs!

4609
03:56:31,520 --> 03:56:33,140
The feel of keys on my feathers.

4610
03:56:33,580 --> 03:56:35,760
You can just write a book or something!

4611
03:56:36,420 --> 03:56:38,200
You don't need a job for that!

4612
03:56:38,900 --> 03:56:40,920
The clicking and clacking as I push them down.

4613
03:56:41,300 --> 03:56:42,780
Look at me getting carried away.

4614
03:56:42,880 --> 03:56:43,800
Just write a book!

4615
03:56:44,520 --> 03:56:45,020
Go on.

4616
03:56:45,180 --> 03:56:47,240
You best finish cleaning this up.

4617
03:56:47,340 --> 03:56:49,200
I have a resume to write.

4618
03:56:50,800 --> 03:56:53,440
So I guess we're all gonna be out of our jobs soon.

4619
03:56:54,160 --> 03:56:56,340
Finally can free-free of the rat race.

4620
03:56:56,440 --> 03:56:56,900
Be free!

4621
03:56:56,900 --> 03:56:59,920
I never wanted to be a reaper, you know.

4622
03:57:01,680 --> 03:57:03,000
It was just a matter of necessity.

4623
03:57:03,720 --> 03:57:04,820
I wonder what I could do next.

4624
03:57:05,260 --> 03:57:07,380
I guess endless possibilities lies ahead.

4625
03:57:07,660 --> 03:57:12,120
Cause that depends on you finishing your job without getting killed in the process.

4626
03:57:13,000 --> 03:57:14,520
But I reckon you'll get it done, kid.

4627
03:57:14,660 --> 03:57:16,220
Aren't you guys gonna help?

4628
03:57:16,760 --> 03:57:19,580
Like, a revolution is not one per- Guys!

4629
03:57:19,720 --> 03:57:21,100
There's so many of us!

4630
03:57:23,040 --> 03:57:24,620
Why is it just me?

4631
03:57:24,620 --> 03:57:27,140
A revolution is not one crow!

4632
03:57:28,860 --> 03:57:32,180
All this death and rebirth is no help.

4633
03:57:32,820 --> 03:57:34,340
It is a daunting prospect.

4634
03:57:35,100 --> 03:57:37,560
I think everyone here is sick of what this world has become.

4635
03:57:37,900 --> 03:57:38,660
A new world.

4636
03:57:38,820 --> 03:57:39,660
A new start.

4637
03:57:40,140 --> 03:57:41,900
I wonder if there will be new TV shows too.

4638
03:57:42,940 --> 03:57:43,480
What about you?

4639
03:57:44,240 --> 03:57:47,080
I feel like my whole world is crumbling beneath my feet.

4640
03:57:47,840 --> 03:57:51,880
But somehow, no jobs just open a crumbly fence.

4641
03:57:51,880 --> 03:57:53,760
Thank you for the super chat.

4642
03:57:53,840 --> 03:57:54,580
Thank you, thank you.

4643
03:57:55,100 --> 03:57:57,460
But somehow, I also feel hopeful for the first time.

4644
03:57:57,860 --> 03:58:00,800
Actually, I think this is the first time I felt hope.

4645
03:58:02,160 --> 03:58:04,680
Maybe I won't have to work so hard anymore.

4646
03:58:05,700 --> 03:58:06,280
Let's go.

4647
03:58:07,040 --> 03:58:08,720
A revolution is upon us.

4648
03:58:09,300 --> 03:58:10,280
We go up now.

4649
03:58:10,960 --> 03:58:11,740
Get away, kids.

4650
03:58:12,580 --> 03:58:13,220
Adults only.

4651
03:58:15,820 --> 03:58:19,460
Alright, it's time to open the big door.

4652
03:58:23,530 --> 03:58:24,830
I am here now.

4653
03:58:26,090 --> 03:58:26,910
That's right.

4654
03:58:27,710 --> 03:58:29,710
I am here for the big man.

4655
03:58:32,890 --> 03:58:34,170
You thought you could live forever?

4656
03:58:35,030 --> 03:58:36,550
Nobody lives forever.

4657
03:58:37,650 --> 03:58:39,010
I've been watching you, young crow.

4658
03:58:39,910 --> 03:58:40,510
Oh, me?

4659
03:58:41,410 --> 03:58:43,190
I never thought I would come to this.

4660
03:58:43,410 --> 03:58:44,850
Yet, here we are.

4661
03:58:48,250 --> 03:58:53,910
Each of my kind are created by the Lord preceding them and trained to take over their duties before they pass on.

4662
03:58:54,450 --> 03:58:58,030
On the day we are created, we are told the day on which we will die.

4663
03:59:00,310 --> 03:59:04,290
My predecessor, my creator, was a cold-hearted tyrant.

4664
03:59:05,070 --> 03:59:08,550
Obsessed with rules and order, how things had to be.

4665
03:59:09,370 --> 03:59:12,490
That old fool never even gave me a name, can you believe?

4666
03:59:12,550 --> 03:59:13,810
You can give yourself a name.

4667
03:59:13,870 --> 03:59:14,910
You're a free man.

4668
03:59:20,110 --> 03:59:24,650
How would your life play out if you knew the exact day you were going to die?

4669
03:59:25,270 --> 03:59:32,810
If every moment of your existence revolved around its ending, I'd do everything in my power to save myself.

4670
03:59:34,610 --> 03:59:39,270
I know my actions are not entirely moral, perhaps not even justifiable.

4671
03:59:40,170 --> 03:59:42,410
But I cannot just let myself die.

4672
03:59:43,150 --> 03:59:45,110
I refuse to go without a fight.

4673
03:59:46,570 --> 03:59:52,290
So, young crow, are you ready to fight for your life as I am for mine?

4674
03:59:55,570 --> 03:59:56,050
Alright.

4675
03:59:57,110 --> 03:59:57,790
Oh my god.

4676
03:59:58,030 --> 03:59:58,710
Oh my god.

4677
03:59:58,790 --> 03:59:59,450
What the fuck?

4678
03:59:59,450 --> 04:00:00,090
He just slams.

4679
04:00:01,330 --> 04:00:02,190
Spirit bomb!

4680
04:00:05,470 --> 04:00:05,950
Okay.

4681
04:00:06,470 --> 04:00:07,310
That all he does?

4682
04:00:08,370 --> 04:00:09,190
Oh my god.

4683
04:00:09,270 --> 04:00:09,930
Oh my god.

4684
04:00:10,630 --> 04:00:11,110
Okay.

4685
04:00:11,430 --> 04:00:14,450
Guys, I- Man, I wish like, you know.

4686
04:00:15,670 --> 04:00:17,110
Oh wait, that's not all he does.

4687
04:00:17,230 --> 04:00:18,210
Oh my god!

4688
04:00:19,470 --> 04:00:20,430
Oh my god.

4689
04:00:20,670 --> 04:00:22,530
He's using the doors against me.

4690
04:00:26,980 --> 04:00:28,400
What the fuck?

4691
04:00:28,760 --> 04:00:29,700
Where'd he go?

4692
04:00:30,940 --> 04:00:33,000
He went to another door?

4693
04:00:35,180 --> 04:00:36,540
What the fuck?

4694
04:00:37,340 --> 04:00:38,660
Where'd he go?

4695
04:00:40,980 --> 04:00:42,040
Oh shit!

4696
04:00:42,440 --> 04:00:44,000
It's this type of game!

4697
04:00:45,260 --> 04:00:46,940
How do I get across?

4698
04:00:48,000 --> 04:00:48,240
Hello?

4699
04:00:48,780 --> 04:00:49,220
Oh.

4700
04:00:51,000 --> 04:00:51,800
Okay.

4701
04:00:54,700 --> 04:00:55,000
Okay.

4702
04:00:55,000 --> 04:00:56,600
I use my mechanics.

4703
04:00:59,120 --> 04:00:59,880
Okay.

4704
04:01:02,900 --> 04:01:04,640
Okay, I figured it out.

4705
04:01:09,630 --> 04:01:10,390
Oh!

4706
04:01:10,590 --> 04:01:10,930
No!

4707
04:01:12,310 --> 04:01:13,270
It's okay.

4708
04:01:13,350 --> 04:01:14,570
I can make one mistake.

4709
04:01:18,460 --> 04:01:19,060
Wait, what?

4710
04:01:19,580 --> 04:01:20,260
Okay, goodbye.

4711
04:01:21,820 --> 04:01:22,680
Another door.

4712
04:01:25,100 --> 04:01:25,620
Oh!

4713
04:01:31,340 --> 04:01:32,000
Oh!

4714
04:01:38,180 --> 04:01:39,960
Oh my god, he slaps, guys.

4715
04:01:40,610 --> 04:01:41,240
I learned.

4716
04:01:42,140 --> 04:01:43,080
I realized.

4717
04:01:43,700 --> 04:01:45,160
He slaps back.

4718
04:01:46,160 --> 04:01:48,580
Okay, guys, I should've got dexterity.

4719
04:01:49,040 --> 04:01:51,080
I- Guys!

4720
04:01:52,480 --> 04:01:55,740
I think- I should've got dexterity, guys.

4721
04:01:59,580 --> 04:02:02,140
I think I made a mistake.

4722
04:02:06,100 --> 04:02:07,840
Who would've thought?

4723
04:02:08,980 --> 04:02:16,260
Maybe I should not have- Maybe I should not have- What?!

4724
04:02:16,880 --> 04:02:17,520
Okay.

4725
04:02:18,600 --> 04:02:19,600
This is bullshit.

4726
04:02:20,880 --> 04:02:25,120
Okay, I- This level is- This level is a little hard.

4727
04:02:28,780 --> 04:02:30,520
I'm also a little stupid.

4728
04:02:31,320 --> 04:02:32,660
Oh no, I'm 1 HP.

4729
04:02:32,660 --> 04:02:35,260
Oh no, this is bad.

4730
04:02:35,600 --> 04:02:40,420
This is- This is- This is pretty bad.

4731
04:02:43,220 --> 04:02:46,180
This is pretty bad.

4732
04:02:50,360 --> 04:02:50,820
Okay.

4733
04:02:52,900 --> 04:02:53,820
Okay.

4734
04:02:56,160 --> 04:02:58,640
I ran into it!

4735
04:02:58,980 --> 04:03:00,060
Okay, I understand!

4736
04:03:00,060 --> 04:03:00,380
I understand!

4737
04:03:00,380 --> 04:03:01,340
I understand!

4738
04:03:03,600 --> 04:03:04,200
Okay.

4739
04:03:05,940 --> 04:03:07,200
Oh shit, nice.

4740
04:03:07,420 --> 04:03:08,680
I figured it out.

4741
04:03:08,780 --> 04:03:11,080
I don't get punished that badly, at least.

4742
04:03:11,900 --> 04:03:13,380
I figured it out, guys.

4743
04:03:14,640 --> 04:03:16,260
I'm not as stupid.

4744
04:03:20,360 --> 04:03:21,320
Okay, there we go.

4745
04:03:22,360 --> 04:03:23,560
I figured it out.

4746
04:03:25,640 --> 04:03:28,760
I just- I need to do so many dodging.

4747
04:03:32,980 --> 04:03:34,980
Okay, I need to go so fast.

4748
04:03:35,200 --> 04:03:36,500
So it's scary.

4749
04:03:38,580 --> 04:03:42,200
Wait, does he keep his damage from before though?

4750
04:03:43,900 --> 04:03:45,980
Okay, I need to use the Kamehameha.

4751
04:03:46,320 --> 04:03:48,980
Because I- Oh!

4752
04:03:49,960 --> 04:03:50,860
I missed!

4753
04:03:52,300 --> 04:03:52,580
Oh!

4754
04:03:58,280 --> 04:03:58,900
Okay.

4755
04:03:59,720 --> 04:04:06,480
I have to be not too- I have to- Are you serious?!

4756
04:04:06,480 --> 04:04:11,540
That doesn't give me i- I should've got i-frames for that.

4757
04:04:12,140 --> 04:04:15,560
That should've been- That should've been i-frames right there.

4758
04:04:17,500 --> 04:04:20,360
That should 100% give me i-frames.

4759
04:04:24,450 --> 04:04:27,810
The i-frame sometimes is like, so confusing.

4760
04:04:28,090 --> 04:04:30,130
Because it's like, I don't know when it's gonna do it.

4761
04:04:32,130 --> 04:04:32,850
You know?

4762
04:04:33,810 --> 04:04:36,390
It's like, when is it gonna give me those frames?

4763
04:04:41,190 --> 04:04:42,910
Of course I want one second of i-frames.

4764
04:04:42,950 --> 04:04:43,550
What the fuck?

4765
04:04:45,690 --> 04:04:46,930
Okay, Kamehameha.

4766
04:04:48,050 --> 04:04:49,370
Oh shit, I missed the portal.

4767
04:04:51,090 --> 04:04:51,390
Boom.

4768
04:04:51,710 --> 04:04:52,130
Boom.

4769
04:04:53,250 --> 04:04:53,870
Boom.

4770
04:04:54,890 --> 04:04:55,170
Oh!

4771
04:04:56,310 --> 04:04:56,930
Boom.

4772
04:04:57,790 --> 04:04:58,070
Oh!

4773
04:04:59,210 --> 04:04:59,710
Ah!

4774
04:05:00,090 --> 04:05:00,710
No!

4775
04:05:04,490 --> 04:05:05,110
Oh!

4776
04:05:07,090 --> 04:05:09,330
I'm like, I'm fucking panicking.

4777
04:05:11,910 --> 04:05:12,410
Oh!

4778
04:05:12,730 --> 04:05:14,990
I'm panicking when he does that.

4779
04:05:16,590 --> 04:05:17,270
Oh yeah.

4780
04:05:18,910 --> 04:05:19,410
Oh!

4781
04:05:19,510 --> 04:05:20,070
Oh my god!

4782
04:05:20,390 --> 04:05:21,390
He almost slapped me!

4783
04:05:21,990 --> 04:05:24,090
He almost slapped me, that freak!

4784
04:05:27,110 --> 04:05:27,870
Where am I?

4785
04:05:27,930 --> 04:05:28,890
I don't know this area!

4786
04:05:33,570 --> 04:05:35,190
Oh no, I have to go fast.

4787
04:05:37,330 --> 04:05:37,670
Oh!

4788
04:05:37,670 --> 04:05:39,110
Oh!

4789
04:05:42,150 --> 04:05:43,250
Oh, I have to go so fast!

4790
04:05:48,290 --> 04:05:48,750
Oh!

4791
04:05:49,470 --> 04:05:50,390
Oh!

4792
04:05:52,050 --> 04:05:54,010
Jesus Christ, these mechanics!

4793
04:05:55,970 --> 04:05:58,170
Oh no, what is he gonna do now?

4794
04:05:59,150 --> 04:05:59,610
Oh!

4795
04:06:02,730 --> 04:06:03,650
Oh!

4796
04:06:04,310 --> 04:06:04,830
No!

4797
04:06:08,550 --> 04:06:10,510
It's so fast!

4798
04:06:11,890 --> 04:06:12,750
Oh, please.

4799
04:06:12,890 --> 04:06:13,750
How far am I?

4800
04:06:14,050 --> 04:06:14,350
Ah!

4801
04:06:15,230 --> 04:06:17,470
I had to do it all from the beginning!

4802
04:06:18,410 --> 04:06:20,090
Ah, you fucking freak!

4803
04:06:20,610 --> 04:06:22,130
Oh, I almost ran into it.

4804
04:06:22,890 --> 04:06:24,750
I had to go all the way?

4805
04:06:26,770 --> 04:06:27,290
Oh!

4806
04:06:28,750 --> 04:06:29,270
Okay.

4807
04:06:29,590 --> 04:06:31,090
Okay, I figured it out though.

4808
04:06:33,270 --> 04:06:34,590
Okay, I know what to do.

4809
04:06:38,370 --> 04:06:38,890
Okay.

4810
04:06:38,890 --> 04:06:39,010
Okay.

4811
04:06:40,210 --> 04:06:43,010
Okay, this boss fight is actually pretty intense.

4812
04:06:45,930 --> 04:06:46,810
Three hits.

4813
04:06:47,250 --> 04:06:47,730
Three hits.

4814
04:06:48,050 --> 04:06:48,650
Three hits!

4815
04:06:50,610 --> 04:06:51,270
Okay.

4816
04:06:52,670 --> 04:06:53,970
What if I just use the arrows?

4817
04:06:54,410 --> 04:06:55,110
I'll use arrows.

4818
04:06:55,950 --> 04:06:57,290
Because arrows are faster.

4819
04:07:01,050 --> 04:07:01,590
Oh!

4820
04:07:04,320 --> 04:07:04,650
Okay.

4821
04:07:12,220 --> 04:07:12,880
Nice!

4822
04:07:12,880 --> 04:07:14,320
Okay, I'll just use arrows.

4823
04:07:14,600 --> 04:07:16,320
I'll just use arrows, they're faster.

4824
04:07:17,260 --> 04:07:18,440
Okay, first part.

4825
04:07:18,740 --> 04:07:19,140
Done!

4826
04:07:20,380 --> 04:07:20,820
Okay.

4827
04:07:22,380 --> 04:07:25,300
Okay, this fight is actually very intense, guys.

4828
04:07:25,920 --> 04:07:28,380
I think this is a really- I like the design of this boss fight.

4829
04:07:29,100 --> 04:07:31,060
But it's very...

4830
04:07:31,060 --> 04:07:31,540
scary.

4831
04:07:35,400 --> 04:07:35,960
Oh!

4832
04:07:36,800 --> 04:07:37,920
Oh my god.

4833
04:07:38,740 --> 04:07:39,860
First part figured out!

4834
04:07:40,180 --> 04:07:40,740
Downloaded!

4835
04:07:40,740 --> 04:07:40,840
Downloaded!

4836
04:07:43,160 --> 04:07:44,860
Alright, arrows the key.

4837
04:07:45,380 --> 04:07:46,740
Guys, why didn't you guys...

4838
04:07:47,260 --> 04:07:48,740
selectively tell me...

4839
04:07:49,520 --> 04:07:50,760
to get dexterity?

4840
04:07:58,770 --> 04:07:59,530
Okay.

4841
04:08:00,410 --> 04:08:01,170
Okay.

4842
04:08:06,790 --> 04:08:07,070
Oh!

4843
04:08:07,890 --> 04:08:12,410
I dodged it!

4844
04:08:13,690 --> 04:08:16,190
That was totally a dodge!

4845
04:08:21,650 --> 04:08:23,530
That was totally a dodge.

4846
04:08:23,530 --> 04:08:25,750
I refuse to believe that wasn't a dodge.

4847
04:08:26,250 --> 04:08:27,850
I can't believe it.

4848
04:08:29,610 --> 04:08:31,710
I refuse to believe it.

4849
04:08:32,930 --> 04:08:34,670
Not my fucking dodge.

4850
04:08:37,350 --> 04:08:37,950
Okay.

4851
04:08:39,930 --> 04:08:40,370
Ah!

4852
04:08:40,590 --> 04:08:41,690
No, no, no, no, no, no!

4853
04:08:41,850 --> 04:08:43,250
Oh my god, I almost rolled off!

4854
04:08:43,550 --> 04:08:44,510
I almost rolled off!

4855
04:08:46,070 --> 04:08:46,670
Okay.

4856
04:08:47,390 --> 04:08:49,770
I gotta be very careful with this one.

4857
04:08:49,770 --> 04:08:50,810
I...

4858
04:08:51,770 --> 04:08:53,370
I was like on the edge.

4859
04:08:54,230 --> 04:08:56,110
That was so close.

4860
04:08:57,850 --> 04:08:59,710
Oh, I don't not...

4861
04:08:59,710 --> 04:09:00,610
This is scary.

4862
04:09:04,770 --> 04:09:06,730
Oh my god!

4863
04:09:09,680 --> 04:09:10,440
Okay.

4864
04:09:14,410 --> 04:09:15,530
Oh my god.

4865
04:09:15,550 --> 04:09:16,430
He's almost broken.

4866
04:09:17,110 --> 04:09:18,210
He's so close!

4867
04:09:19,690 --> 04:09:21,270
God, that roll is so...

4868
04:09:21,270 --> 04:09:22,310
There's more?

4869
04:09:23,270 --> 04:09:24,130
Oh no.

4870
04:09:25,090 --> 04:09:26,050
Oh no.

4871
04:09:29,170 --> 04:09:30,390
Okay.

4872
04:09:45,290 --> 04:09:47,170
Jesus Christ!

4873
04:09:49,290 --> 04:09:50,950
We made it!

4874
04:09:52,540 --> 04:09:53,690
Where are we?

4875
04:09:54,250 --> 04:09:55,330
We're full HP!

4876
04:09:57,030 --> 04:09:57,790
We're full HP!

4877
04:09:57,790 --> 04:09:58,890
Oh thank god!

4878
04:09:59,890 --> 04:10:00,210
Wait.

4879
04:10:00,770 --> 04:10:02,310
That was all a distraction?

4880
04:10:03,690 --> 04:10:04,610
What happened?

4881
04:10:08,470 --> 04:10:09,530
What happened?

4882
04:10:13,310 --> 04:10:14,070
What?

4883
04:10:17,010 --> 04:10:18,090
Wait, he's full HP!

4884
04:10:19,250 --> 04:10:20,850
Why are we here, crew?

4885
04:10:22,050 --> 04:10:23,230
Why do I exist?

4886
04:10:23,990 --> 04:10:27,290
To follow in the footsteps of the lords before me?

4887
04:10:27,290 --> 04:10:32,610
To repeat the same thing over and over to what end?

4888
04:10:33,950 --> 04:10:35,150
What is the point?

4889
04:10:35,230 --> 04:10:36,110
Where are the crews?

4890
04:10:36,770 --> 04:10:38,430
And we all have to die eventually.

4891
04:10:39,910 --> 04:10:41,890
I suppose I will never know.

4892
04:10:45,090 --> 04:10:47,490
Because I will never die!

4893
04:10:54,180 --> 04:10:55,960
What are you doing?

4894
04:11:00,830 --> 04:11:02,570
The last lord.

4895
04:11:03,250 --> 04:11:04,530
Wait, did I not?

4896
04:11:05,130 --> 04:11:05,890
What do you mean?

4897
04:11:05,990 --> 04:11:07,770
What happened to all the progress I did before?

4898
04:11:10,230 --> 04:11:12,010
Why is he so much bigger?

4899
04:11:15,350 --> 04:11:16,410
Oh my!

4900
04:11:23,030 --> 04:11:24,410
What was that?

4901
04:11:26,850 --> 04:11:28,430
What the fuck?

4902
04:11:37,020 --> 04:11:37,840
What?

4903
04:11:38,240 --> 04:11:40,900
Guys, I don't think I'm gonna live.

4904
04:11:44,120 --> 04:11:44,940
Guys.

4905
04:11:46,080 --> 04:11:50,300
This ain't looking so good for Doki Croki.

4906
04:11:51,780 --> 04:11:55,060
This ain't looking so good right now.

4907
04:12:10,250 --> 04:12:11,950
Holy shit!

4908
04:12:12,350 --> 04:12:13,250
Okay.

4909
04:12:15,650 --> 04:12:17,690
Oh my god.

4910
04:12:18,490 --> 04:12:19,790
Hello, I woke up.

4911
04:12:20,170 --> 04:12:20,710
It's fine.

4912
04:12:21,690 --> 04:12:22,650
Round two.

4913
04:12:23,870 --> 04:12:25,530
Round two, I guess.

4914
04:12:29,350 --> 04:12:30,610
Round two.

4915
04:12:34,550 --> 04:12:36,690
What do I do?

4916
04:12:38,090 --> 04:12:39,450
Against that?

4917
04:12:43,010 --> 04:12:43,610
Oh no.

4918
04:12:44,670 --> 04:12:45,590
Oh no.

4919
04:12:46,010 --> 04:12:47,570
Oh, I don't like this one.

4920
04:12:48,610 --> 04:12:50,590
Oh my god!

4921
04:12:50,670 --> 04:12:52,530
The stupid fuzz!

4922
04:13:02,070 --> 04:13:02,930
Stupid!

4923
04:13:06,380 --> 04:13:08,450
How do I get out of that?

4924
04:13:08,970 --> 04:13:10,130
I don't understand.

4925
04:13:10,570 --> 04:13:11,870
My brain can't comprehend.

4926
04:13:14,610 --> 04:13:16,330
It can't comprehend it!

4927
04:13:17,230 --> 04:13:18,130
Brain too stupid!

4928
04:13:21,270 --> 04:13:22,990
I... fuck you!

4929
04:13:40,090 --> 04:13:41,470
The backhand!

4930
04:13:41,550 --> 04:13:42,250
I'm too greedy.

4931
04:13:44,770 --> 04:13:46,310
I'm too greedy.

4932
04:13:47,650 --> 04:13:49,230
I'm too...

4933
04:13:49,950 --> 04:13:51,270
I'm too greedy.

4934
04:13:51,870 --> 04:13:53,310
I need to...

4935
04:13:53,310 --> 04:13:55,150
I need to not be so greedy.

4936
04:14:01,910 --> 04:14:02,550
Okay.

4937
04:14:03,390 --> 04:14:04,130
Don't be greedy.

4938
04:14:08,140 --> 04:14:08,780
Okay.

4939
04:14:10,060 --> 04:14:11,760
Don't let him do that to you.

4940
04:14:11,820 --> 04:14:12,380
Oh shit!

4941
04:14:13,160 --> 04:14:14,340
Sorry, I got confused.

4942
04:14:16,360 --> 04:14:18,340
I hate this one the most.

4943
04:14:20,460 --> 04:14:20,940
I...

4944
04:14:23,700 --> 04:14:25,540
I... oh my god!

4945
04:14:25,880 --> 04:14:27,520
It's so hard to dodge!

4946
04:14:29,080 --> 04:14:30,760
It's actually so hard!

4947
04:14:32,960 --> 04:14:33,560
Jesus!

4948
04:14:34,820 --> 04:14:35,900
Don't get greedy.

4949
04:14:37,240 --> 04:14:38,460
Don't get greedy.

4950
04:14:43,140 --> 04:14:44,520
Okay, okay, I know.

4951
04:14:44,720 --> 04:14:45,540
Just let him mash it.

4952
04:14:48,640 --> 04:14:49,240
Okay.

4953
04:14:51,500 --> 04:14:52,100
Okay.

4954
04:15:01,240 --> 04:15:04,180
How does that hit me?!

4955
04:15:04,180 --> 04:15:06,160
That should not have hit me.

4956
04:15:09,550 --> 04:15:10,970
That actually should...

4957
04:15:10,970 --> 04:15:11,790
Ah!

4958
04:15:16,450 --> 04:15:17,130
Ah!

4959
04:15:17,810 --> 04:15:19,050
Okay, okay.

4960
04:15:19,550 --> 04:15:22,070
Every try, every try I get better.

4961
04:15:22,630 --> 04:15:23,510
Every try.

4962
04:15:25,490 --> 04:15:25,830
Oh!

4963
04:15:27,910 --> 04:15:28,590
Okay.

4964
04:15:30,290 --> 04:15:31,770
He's gonna do a backhand there.

4965
04:15:32,250 --> 04:15:32,850
If he wanted to.

4966
04:15:33,450 --> 04:15:34,190
I could tell.

4967
04:15:36,650 --> 04:15:37,770
Oh my god!

4968
04:15:37,850 --> 04:15:39,070
I jumped into that, I'm so dumb.

4969
04:15:41,170 --> 04:15:42,430
I'm so dumb!

4970
04:15:42,430 --> 04:15:43,670
Crookies!

4971
04:15:43,970 --> 04:15:44,650
Crookies!

4972
04:15:45,070 --> 04:15:45,650
Dumb!

4973
04:15:47,790 --> 04:15:48,310
Okay.

4974
04:15:48,910 --> 04:15:50,090
Do a circle, okay.

4975
04:15:52,470 --> 04:15:53,610
A pose!

4976
04:15:56,090 --> 04:15:57,910
Just end me!

4977
04:15:59,110 --> 04:16:01,330
I hate the lasers!

4978
04:16:02,630 --> 04:16:04,570
I hate the lasers!

4979
04:16:07,360 --> 04:16:07,830
Okay.

4980
04:16:08,950 --> 04:16:11,510
I hate the lasers so much.

4981
04:16:11,510 --> 04:16:13,870
The lasers are so stupid.

4982
04:16:14,690 --> 04:16:16,950
Why did that...

4983
04:16:16,950 --> 04:16:17,530
End this.

4984
04:16:17,670 --> 04:16:18,790
I already fucked it up.

4985
04:16:20,730 --> 04:16:22,770
Why you prolong my suffering?

4986
04:16:23,230 --> 04:16:24,570
Why you prolong it?

4987
04:16:25,030 --> 04:16:25,650
End this.

4988
04:16:26,070 --> 04:16:27,270
End this.

4989
04:16:29,930 --> 04:16:31,790
Oh my... Okay, this time, this time.

4990
04:16:31,850 --> 04:16:32,410
This is it.

4991
04:16:33,010 --> 04:16:34,390
I walked into the last one.

4992
04:16:34,430 --> 04:16:35,230
It was my bad.

4993
04:16:35,490 --> 04:16:36,110
It was NB.

4994
04:16:37,470 --> 04:16:38,350
My bad.

4995
04:16:40,810 --> 04:16:41,410
Okay.

4996
04:16:42,790 --> 04:16:43,390
Okay.

4997
04:16:43,390 --> 04:16:43,990
There we go.

4998
04:16:48,090 --> 04:16:48,690
Okay.

4999
04:16:49,650 --> 04:16:50,250
Oh

5000
04:16:53,640 --> 04:16:53,980
my god.

5001
04:16:54,400 --> 04:16:56,080
That backhand is so scary sometimes.

5002
04:16:57,640 --> 04:17:00,620
Okay, I know he does that after...

5003
04:17:00,620 --> 04:17:01,560
The stupid...

5004
04:17:02,680 --> 04:17:03,280
What?!

5005
04:17:05,400 --> 04:17:06,000
Really?!

5006
04:17:16,290 --> 04:17:16,890
Okay.

5007
04:17:17,890 --> 04:17:19,370
That shouldn't have hit me earlier.

5008
04:17:19,370 --> 04:17:21,050
I'm so sad that that hit me.

5009
04:17:22,030 --> 04:17:23,030
Oh god.

5010
04:17:25,230 --> 04:17:26,590
I'm not gonna...

5011
04:17:26,590 --> 04:17:27,610
Play slow.

5012
04:17:30,350 --> 04:17:30,910
Okay.

5013
04:17:35,260 --> 04:17:35,720
No!

5014
04:17:36,520 --> 04:17:39,220
I was not trying to roll there too!

5015
04:17:41,720 --> 04:17:42,400
No!

5016
04:17:45,660 --> 04:17:47,160
You stupid backshots!

5017
04:17:47,560 --> 04:17:48,920
You stupid...

5018
04:17:49,920 --> 04:17:52,020
Stupid fucking...

5019
04:17:52,020 --> 04:17:52,680
Backslap!

5020
04:17:54,800 --> 04:17:55,840
Jesus Christ.

5021
04:18:04,510 --> 04:18:05,410
Oh no.

5022
04:18:09,350 --> 04:18:10,050
No!

5023
04:18:11,470 --> 04:18:12,510
No!

5024
04:18:14,210 --> 04:18:15,010
No!

5025
04:18:17,710 --> 04:18:18,810
Oh my god.

5026
04:18:22,520 --> 04:18:23,800
Woo!

5027
04:18:29,130 --> 04:18:29,790
No!

5028
04:18:30,690 --> 04:18:31,350
Dodge!

5029
04:18:38,240 --> 04:18:39,920
I hate the back...

5030
04:18:39,920 --> 04:18:41,660
It's always the backslap.

5031
04:18:42,060 --> 04:18:43,720
It's always...

5032
04:18:43,720 --> 04:18:46,500
The fucking backslap that he does.

5033
04:18:50,530 --> 04:18:50,830
Okay.

5034
04:18:54,780 --> 04:18:56,100
Okay.

5035
04:18:59,950 --> 04:19:00,610
Okay.

5036
04:19:01,430 --> 04:19:02,770
Don't get backslapped.

5037
04:19:05,930 --> 04:19:06,570
Okay.

5038
04:19:08,670 --> 04:19:11,310
No, they are.

5039
04:19:11,790 --> 04:19:12,970
They're so fucking...

5040
04:19:12,970 --> 04:19:13,890
Fucking hard.

5041
04:19:15,210 --> 04:19:15,510
No!

5042
04:19:20,650 --> 04:19:22,970
They're so hard to deal with sometimes.

5043
04:19:25,250 --> 04:19:27,170
I'm trying so hard to like...

5044
04:19:27,170 --> 04:19:28,850
Calculate when he does that.

5045
04:19:30,770 --> 04:19:30,990
Woo!

5046
04:19:35,260 --> 04:19:35,900
Okay.

5047
04:19:41,950 --> 04:19:42,630
Woo!

5048
04:19:43,550 --> 04:19:44,190
Woo!

5049
04:19:48,810 --> 04:19:49,490
Oh!

5050
04:19:51,190 --> 04:19:51,870
No!

5051
04:19:59,480 --> 04:20:00,480
Jesus Christ.

5052
04:20:00,520 --> 04:20:00,840
What?

5053
04:20:02,240 --> 04:20:05,600
I thought he was going to do a laser for some reason.

5054
04:20:06,580 --> 04:20:07,580
Okay, now he is.

5055
04:20:11,680 --> 04:20:12,360
God.

5056
04:20:16,890 --> 04:20:17,570
What?

5057
04:20:17,630 --> 04:20:18,130
There's more?

5058
04:20:18,550 --> 04:20:19,070
No!

5059
04:20:19,250 --> 04:20:19,930
The fucking...

5060
04:20:19,930 --> 04:20:20,210
Oh

5061
04:20:23,690 --> 04:20:26,670
my god.

5062
04:20:27,810 --> 04:20:28,570
Oh!

5063
04:20:31,110 --> 04:20:32,490
Backslap, I knew it.

5064
04:20:35,050 --> 04:20:35,810
Okay.

5065
04:20:42,710 --> 04:20:43,470
Oh!

5066
04:20:44,770 --> 04:20:45,530
No!

5067
04:20:45,670 --> 04:20:46,770
What is that?

5068
04:20:48,210 --> 04:20:49,550
What did he do?

5069
04:20:51,690 --> 04:20:53,350
I don't know what he did.

5070
04:21:00,710 --> 04:21:02,210
No, not the laser.

5071
04:21:04,890 --> 04:21:05,990
Oh, fuck.

5072
04:21:06,770 --> 04:21:07,450
Fuck.

5073
04:21:09,850 --> 04:21:11,370
Actually, the scariest one.

5074
04:21:22,780 --> 04:21:23,040
Oh!

5075
04:21:25,160 --> 04:21:27,020
I fucking did it!

5076
04:21:27,340 --> 04:21:28,020
Please.

5077
04:21:29,000 --> 04:21:30,180
Forgive me.

5078
04:21:31,760 --> 04:21:33,360
I'm going to backslap you.

5079
04:21:33,920 --> 04:21:34,940
Get over here.

5080
04:21:35,520 --> 04:21:36,780
Get over here.

5081
04:21:36,840 --> 04:21:38,020
I'm going to fucking slap you.

5082
04:21:40,500 --> 04:21:41,640
Oh my god.

5083
04:21:42,480 --> 04:21:44,220
Today, we're more in the passing of being.

5084
04:21:44,220 --> 04:21:46,880
We shape the very fabric of our world.

5085
04:21:47,600 --> 04:21:48,940
Viva la revolution!

5086
04:21:50,560 --> 04:21:52,020
The end of a lineage.

5087
04:21:52,820 --> 04:21:54,320
The last lord of doors.

5088
04:21:58,220 --> 04:22:00,060
The true cruel god.

5089
04:22:00,140 --> 04:22:01,360
Thank you for the super chat.

5090
04:22:01,460 --> 04:22:02,260
Thank you, thank you.

5091
04:22:02,580 --> 04:22:04,480
To some, they were a mysterious leader.

5092
04:22:07,100 --> 04:22:10,400
To others, a dark cloud looming over the world.

5093
04:22:13,140 --> 04:22:16,160
Driven by a desire to be greater than their creator.

5094
04:22:18,640 --> 04:22:22,900
They will be remembered for their part in the advancement of door technology.

5095
04:22:25,500 --> 04:22:28,920
Their ability to maintain order in a dying world.

5096
04:22:33,030 --> 04:22:36,230
And their unwavering determination to evade death.

5097
04:22:36,830 --> 04:22:39,610
No matter the cost.

5098
04:22:44,810 --> 04:22:46,050
We did it.

5099
04:22:46,710 --> 04:22:48,530
Viva la crovulation!

5100
04:22:51,470 --> 04:22:53,170
All with his head.

5101
04:22:58,030 --> 04:23:01,610
Their pursuits may have been unwise, but the will to live is deeply ingrained.

5102
04:23:02,430 --> 04:23:06,190
Who is to say what any of us would have done, given the same choices as this lord?

5103
04:23:11,010 --> 04:23:12,610
Bow your head in remembrance.

5104
04:23:13,410 --> 04:23:14,690
Pay your last respects.

5105
04:23:15,870 --> 04:23:17,390
Your time in this world is over.

5106
04:23:21,310 --> 04:23:21,800
Goodbye.

5107
04:23:31,880 --> 04:23:32,860
Goodbye.

5108
04:23:35,780 --> 04:23:37,300
Home run.

5109
04:23:44,150 --> 04:23:45,430
Death's door.

5110
04:23:47,150 --> 04:23:48,730
We did it!

5111
04:23:49,330 --> 04:23:50,690
Oh my god!

5112
04:23:51,230 --> 04:23:52,830
We fucking did it!

5113
04:23:52,950 --> 04:23:54,130
That was fun!

5114
04:23:54,450 --> 04:23:55,690
I really enjoyed it.

5115
04:23:57,110 --> 04:23:58,910
I really enjoyed the game.

5116
04:23:59,010 --> 04:23:59,750
Oh my god.

5117
04:23:59,750 --> 04:24:01,450
There they are.

5118
04:24:01,550 --> 04:24:03,110
Wait, they're all eating his parts.

5119
04:24:03,450 --> 04:24:04,090
No!

5120
04:24:04,650 --> 04:24:05,290
Stop!

5121
04:24:05,770 --> 04:24:06,410
Stop!

5122
04:24:07,110 --> 04:24:08,410
Don't eat it!

5123
04:24:11,570 --> 04:24:12,210
Please!

5124
04:24:12,810 --> 04:24:14,150
It's a fetish thing!

5125
04:24:14,270 --> 04:24:15,210
Don't do it!

5126
04:24:20,330 --> 04:24:21,530
Oh my god!

5127
04:24:21,690 --> 04:24:23,670
It's been a while since we beat a game.

5128
04:24:24,230 --> 04:24:29,610
Since we've been stuck in our Dynasty Warriors series.

5129
04:24:29,750 --> 04:24:33,090
So I'm happy we're actually able to- It's been a long time.

5130
04:24:33,510 --> 04:24:35,410
Since we're able to finish this game.

5131
04:24:35,550 --> 04:24:36,110
Oh my god!

5132
04:24:36,190 --> 04:24:38,110
Me and my best friend parted!

5133
04:24:38,250 --> 04:24:39,530
And all the dragoons!

5134
04:24:39,610 --> 04:24:40,250
Look at that!

5135
04:24:40,890 --> 04:24:43,610
We're not hanging out with that fucking squid freak.

5136
04:24:44,070 --> 04:24:45,150
That was so fun!

5137
04:24:45,470 --> 04:24:46,250
I had a great time.

5138
04:24:46,730 --> 04:24:48,990
We're stuck in the dating sim hell.

5139
04:24:49,390 --> 04:24:51,170
Yeah, that should be the end of the game.

5140
04:24:51,250 --> 04:24:54,150
We're not doing the- We're not being completionist.

5141
04:24:55,490 --> 04:24:57,190
Thank you for the super chat, Adam!

5142
04:24:57,190 --> 04:24:58,370
Thank you, thank you!

5143
04:24:58,610 --> 04:24:59,630
Oh my god, look!

5144
04:24:59,690 --> 04:25:00,710
That's all of us!

5145
04:25:00,930 --> 04:25:01,850
Look at us go!

5146
04:25:03,630 --> 04:25:06,810
Is there a- Is there an after credits scene, guys?

5147
04:25:06,910 --> 04:25:07,910
Or is it just this?

5148
04:25:09,270 --> 04:25:10,890
Oh wait, I can make it faster.

5149
04:25:13,010 --> 04:25:14,290
But yeah, it was really fun!

5150
04:25:14,390 --> 04:25:15,510
I really enjoyed this game.

5151
04:25:16,270 --> 04:25:19,470
I went in accidentally thinking this was a roguelite.

5152
04:25:19,790 --> 04:25:20,910
And it was just Crow.

5153
04:25:21,330 --> 04:25:23,590
It was just- Oh, it was made in Unity.

5154
04:25:23,590 --> 04:25:26,210
It was just Crow Souls-like.

5155
04:25:26,370 --> 04:25:28,110
And I had a lot of fun playing it.

5156
04:25:30,170 --> 04:25:30,590
Oh.

5157
04:25:31,290 --> 04:25:32,270
There he is.

5158
04:25:33,110 --> 04:25:34,570
Oh, there's an after credits scene.

5159
04:25:34,750 --> 04:25:35,790
Yeah, it was a pretty chill game.

5160
04:25:35,850 --> 04:25:36,690
I enjoyed it a lot.

5161
04:25:39,110 --> 04:25:39,950
He's like...

5162
04:25:39,950 --> 04:25:40,770
Doki, doki.

5163
04:25:41,170 --> 04:25:44,110
This is not what I meant when I said I wanted a Souls-like.

5164
04:25:45,030 --> 04:25:45,770
But too bad.

5165
04:25:45,810 --> 04:25:47,070
We get Crow Souls-like.

5166
04:25:48,310 --> 04:25:49,590
Oh, I can still...

5167
04:25:50,390 --> 04:25:51,050
do so.

5168
04:25:51,050 --> 04:25:52,030
Yeah.

5169
04:25:53,270 --> 04:25:54,350
Nice, we did it!

5170
04:25:54,450 --> 04:25:55,510
We're free Crows!

5171
04:25:56,270 --> 04:25:59,250
Guys, we don't need to get jobs anymore!

5172
04:26:00,070 --> 04:26:01,110
Let's go!

5173
04:26:01,530 --> 04:26:03,050
We're free Crows!

5174
04:26:04,050 --> 04:26:05,170
Get out of here, children.

5175
04:26:05,710 --> 04:26:08,230
We're free- I said I'm a free Crow now.

5176
04:26:08,690 --> 04:26:11,150
I don't need to be a father no more.

5177
04:26:12,030 --> 04:26:12,550
Yeah.

5178
04:26:13,010 --> 04:26:15,010
I'm gonna live my life being free.

5179
04:26:15,010 --> 04:26:15,050
We're free!

5180
04:26:18,070 --> 04:26:20,350
We're no more jobs!

5181
04:26:21,110 --> 04:26:22,650
Let's go!

5182
04:26:23,730 --> 04:26:24,130
Yay!

5183
04:26:25,630 --> 04:26:28,450
Crows don't need the concept of money no more!

5184
04:26:32,610 --> 04:26:35,130
Being a parent is a lifelong job.

5185
04:26:35,210 --> 04:26:37,070
What the fuck are you talking about?

5186
04:26:37,370 --> 04:26:38,950
It never stops.

5187
04:26:38,950 --> 04:26:39,150
It never stops.

5188
04:26:43,190 --> 04:26:44,350
Oh my god.

5189
04:26:44,470 --> 04:26:45,130
I'm so happy.

5190
04:26:45,610 --> 04:26:46,630
It was really fun.

5191
04:26:46,790 --> 04:26:50,690
I definitely enjoyed it a lot.

5192
04:26:51,210 --> 04:26:52,130
I think this has been...

5193
04:26:52,130 --> 04:26:55,150
a game I normally don't really play often.

5194
04:26:55,290 --> 04:26:56,110
Like this type of genre.

5195
04:26:56,710 --> 04:26:58,790
So it was really nice to try it out.

5196
04:26:58,830 --> 04:27:01,050
I've been wanting to try this game out for a very long time.

5197
04:27:01,470 --> 04:27:02,530
So I'm glad...

5198
04:27:03,030 --> 04:27:05,130
I'm glad I actually found the time to actually try it.

5199
04:27:05,150 --> 04:27:06,950
Because I was like, oh, what game should I play?

5200
04:27:06,950 --> 04:27:08,350
What game should I play this time?

5201
04:27:08,390 --> 04:27:10,730
I always want to try out different games every so often.

5202
04:27:11,030 --> 04:27:11,410
But yeah!

5203
04:27:11,610 --> 04:27:12,970
It's nice going out of my comfort zone.

5204
04:27:13,190 --> 04:27:13,530
Sometimes.

5205
04:27:14,670 --> 04:27:16,730
But yeah, thank you everybody for watching!

5206
04:27:17,070 --> 04:27:19,130
I hope you guys enjoyed...

5207
04:27:19,130 --> 04:27:19,870
Death's Door.

5208
04:27:20,610 --> 04:27:23,050
My throat actually feels a lot better.

5209
04:27:23,410 --> 04:27:23,830
Recently.

5210
04:27:24,490 --> 04:27:26,950
I haven't been coughing at all when I'm streaming.

5211
04:27:27,370 --> 04:27:28,890
But I don't want to push it too far today.

5212
04:27:29,450 --> 04:27:31,970
But in the future streams, I'm going to try to do...

5213
04:27:31,970 --> 04:27:33,210
After stream chatting again.

5214
04:27:33,610 --> 04:27:35,310
But because I did a long stream today.

5215
04:27:35,310 --> 04:27:36,110
For 4 hours.

5216
04:27:36,230 --> 04:27:37,890
I'm going to chug a little bit.

5217
04:27:38,390 --> 04:27:39,850
Just to rest up a little bit.

5218
04:27:40,010 --> 04:27:43,250
But for future streams, I'm going to try to do after stream chatting again.

5219
04:27:44,890 --> 04:27:45,690
Just so...

5220
04:27:45,690 --> 04:27:46,890
Just because I can now.

5221
04:27:47,370 --> 04:27:47,770
Win!

5222
04:27:47,990 --> 04:27:48,810
Thank you for the super chat!

5223
04:27:48,950 --> 04:27:49,110
Thank you!

5224
04:27:49,690 --> 04:27:52,730
Hey Doki, I just leveled up to 31 a couple of days ago.

5225
04:27:53,010 --> 04:27:55,330
I was wondering if I could get a late happy birthday shoutout.

5226
04:27:55,370 --> 04:27:56,250
Of course, Win!

5227
04:27:56,870 --> 04:27:58,750
Your streams always brighten my day.

5228
04:27:59,150 --> 04:28:00,470
And help me keep going.

5229
04:28:00,750 --> 04:28:01,750
Thanks for everything you do.

5230
04:28:01,750 --> 04:28:04,050
Also, thank you for the super chat.

5231
04:28:04,130 --> 04:28:04,850
Thank you, thank you.

5232
04:28:05,070 --> 04:28:06,670
Happy birthday to you.

5233
04:28:07,030 --> 04:28:08,510
Happy birthday to you.

5234
04:28:08,670 --> 04:28:10,630
Happy birthday dear Winlines.

5235
04:28:10,810 --> 04:28:12,170
Happy birthday to you.

5236
04:28:12,330 --> 04:28:12,930
Yay!

5237
04:28:15,010 --> 04:28:16,210
Happy birthday!

5238
04:28:17,250 --> 04:28:18,830
Hey guys, before I go.

5239
04:28:19,050 --> 04:28:19,850
I'm going to do my show.

5240
04:28:20,170 --> 04:28:22,290
If you want croaky plush right now.

5241
04:28:23,470 --> 04:28:24,270
Croaky can't talk.

5242
04:28:24,810 --> 04:28:27,630
But I have croaky plushes out.

5243
04:28:27,830 --> 04:28:30,410
Also, old girl and tomato meme.

5244
04:28:30,410 --> 04:28:32,350
So, buy now.

5245
04:28:32,510 --> 04:28:34,990
You can purchase a croaky plush right now.

5246
04:28:35,050 --> 04:28:36,070
On YouTubes.

5247
04:28:36,150 --> 04:28:37,610
Let me grab the link real quick.

5248
04:28:38,150 --> 04:28:40,510
YouTube slash collection slash Doki Bear.

5249
04:28:40,810 --> 04:28:42,450
Also, I need to walk dad too.

5250
04:28:42,990 --> 04:28:46,450
That's why I can't do more after stream chatting.

5251
04:28:46,570 --> 04:28:48,150
Because I need to walk him.

5252
04:28:48,390 --> 04:28:50,250
So, he's actually here right now.

5253
04:28:50,310 --> 04:28:51,570
He's like, it's time.

5254
04:28:51,930 --> 04:28:53,830
It's time for walkies, isn't it?

5255
04:28:54,050 --> 04:28:56,890
I know that shill voice.

5256
04:28:57,190 --> 04:28:58,670
Every time you try to shill.

5257
04:28:58,670 --> 04:28:59,930
It's walkies time.

5258
04:29:01,810 --> 04:29:03,410
So, I gotta walk him now.

5259
04:29:03,670 --> 04:29:04,990
Hey guys, thank you all for coming.

5260
04:29:05,270 --> 04:29:06,390
As always everybody.

5261
04:29:06,890 --> 04:29:07,690
Stay hydrated.

5262
04:29:07,930 --> 04:29:11,330
Get that plush look.

5263
04:29:11,570 --> 04:29:12,730
And if you stay up for me.

5264
04:29:12,950 --> 04:29:13,630
Head to bed.

5265
04:29:13,730 --> 04:29:15,030
Because you deserve it.

5266
04:29:15,170 --> 04:29:16,450
See you guys next time everybody.

5267
04:29:16,990 --> 04:29:17,630
Bye guys.

5268
04:29:19,110 --> 04:29:21,390
Sorry, he knows it's walkies time.

5269
04:29:21,490 --> 04:29:21,890
Bye bye.
