1
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,900
Hello, hello, sorry.

2
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,860
I'm all over the place.

3
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,760
Tomorrow, you'll find out.

4
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,400
That's all I can say.

5
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:47,240
Tomorrow.

6
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,940
Tomorrow is the announcement.

7
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:49,760
And you know what?

8
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:53,000
I am more all over the place than usual.

9
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,840
I'm very stressed out.

10
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,640
Tomorrow at 12 p.m.

11
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:08,120
on Twitter, you will find out why I am a mess and I had to delay the stream a little bit.

12
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:14,340
Because I got a last minute work message that I had to like answer.

13
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,040
And then I had... there were so many other...

14
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,520
So yes, sorry for those who don't have Twitter, but that's where the announcement's gonna be.

15
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,440
Unfortunately, for those non-Twitter users.

16
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,000
I will make a community post about it later.

17
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,240
But obviously, it won't be at the same time.

18
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:32,460
It will be a few hours later after the Twitter announcement.

19
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,100
I will be very busy tomorrow.

20
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,380
So, unfortunately, I can't be streaming tomorrow to be like, Hey, bro, talk about it.

21
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,300
But tomorrow is the announcement.

22
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,000
It'll be at 12 p.m.

23
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,340
and you'll find out on Twitter.

24
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,180
Yes, anyway.

25
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,480
But what was that?

26
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:54,900
What else?

27
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,400
What was that?

28
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:55,740
Oh, yeah.

29
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,820
I talked about those who are in member stream.

30
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,460
They get exclusive like first news.

31
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,320
They get exclusive first dad news because I streamed members first.

32
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,160
So, dad update.

33
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,400
It was, like usual, being the dog that he is.

34
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,000
12 p.m.

35
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,140
PST, by the way.

36
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,300
PST, the my time zone.

37
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,820
The correct time zone.

38
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,880
So, dad update.

39
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:28,700
So, last night, yesterday, when I was doing his little walkies at the dog park, he saw another pretty lady.

40
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:32,360
I know we just had a pretty lady short that just came out today.

41
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,960
Anyway, so this was another pretty lady at the park.

42
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:40,660
Um, and she had a little, another poodle terrier, as always.

43
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,560
I have no idea why it's always poodle terriers.

44
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:48,320
I, I personally think that I am not a fan of these little poodle terriers.

45
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,300
You know, they come in all different colors.

46
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,980
Brown, mostly brown.

47
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,340
Um, those like curly poodle terriers because they're like, they don't shed or anything.

48
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,240
But I don't find them very cute, in my opinion.

49
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,460
I'm sorry if you own one.

50
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:07,540
I just see them so much that I've been like desensitized by poodle terriers because I just see them so much.

51
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:13,580
Like, even when I lived, it's a very popular breed in China as well.

52
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,780
I remember because like a lot of my friends own poodle terriers as well.

53
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,060
And I've seen them so much.

54
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,640
And, uh, they're very light though.

55
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,060
I remember like, not chucking one of my friend's dogs.

56
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,680
Or when I, like, compared to like, because I also had a wiener dog back then.

57
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:36,140
Um, but like, compared to like, weight between a poodle terrier and, um, and like wiener dogs.

58
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,480
Wiener dogs are so much heavier than poodle terriers.

59
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:39,360
It's actually crazy.

60
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,200
Um, I'm just like, where, where, where is all your meat?

61
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,200
Like, they're so, poodle terriers are so skinny.

62
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,560
They're like, incredibly skinny.

63
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,360
Like, underneath their fur.

64
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:57,040
But like, um, wiener dogs, dachshunds, they're like, fucking built.

65
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:57,580
You know?

66
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,120
Like, dachshunds are like, muscle.

67
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,320
And...

68
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,160
Or not.

69
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,140
They're either muscles or chonky as fuck.

70
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,480
Um...

71
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,560
Like, I remember, um...

72
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:16,580
I don't understand how dad, how food motivated he is.

73
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,740
Is like, just muscle.

74
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,800
Like, I remember when I would walk dad.

75
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,700
And then like, people would be like, wow, he's so muscular.

76
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,320
Like, look at those legs.

77
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,500
Look at those arms.

78
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,420
I don't understand.

79
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,200
It's, it's either like, they're like, muscular.

80
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,680
Or they're like, fat as fuck.

81
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,840
Cause it's so easy.

82
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,040
Apparently, it's very easy to make a fat weenie.

83
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:43,880
Like...

84
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,220
Yeah, he has to stay fit for the ladies.

85
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,340
Ladies!

86
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,300
Um...

87
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:51,900
Yeah.

88
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,040
But like, anyway.

89
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,460
Um, there's no in-between.

90
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,220
There isn't.

91
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,300
There actually isn't.

92
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,120
Cause like, uh...

93
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,680
Don't say it like that.

94
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,220
Um...

95
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:01,600
Anyway.

96
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:02,880
Anyway.

97
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,940
As I was saying.

98
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,000
He, uh...

99
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,260
You know.

100
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:09,760
The poodle terrier thought that dad was here for...

101
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,320
For him.

102
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,880
For the other dog.

103
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:12,480
Cause you know.

104
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,320
He's like, oh!

105
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:13,980
Friends!

106
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:14,960
You know?

107
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:15,900
Like...

108
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,580
The poodle terrier is like, yippee!

109
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:18,820
Friend!

110
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,600
And then...

111
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,080
So...

112
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,800
Because he was in front of his...

113
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,260
Her owner.

114
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,320
Like his or her owner.

115
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,000
I don't know what gender.

116
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:25,880
Like...

117
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,800
Like the poodle terrier was in front of the owner.

118
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,800
And then obviously dad was like...

119
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,840
Was just walking straight towards the owner.

120
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,840
But the poodle terrier thought that he was walking straight towards him.

121
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:39,400
And then, obviously, he just walked past the poodle terrier.

122
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,060
Straight to the pretty lady.

123
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:41,780
And was...

124
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,300
And just sat down and looked at her.

125
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,680
Like, pet me.

126
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,320
You know, you wanna pet me.

127
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,640
And then obviously...

128
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,460
The other dog was so fucking confused.

129
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,680
Cause he was like...

130
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,080
What?

131
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:58,590
He was...

132
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:03,890
He was so confused, because he was like, he was really hyped up to like, you know, play with dad.

133
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,410
And he's like, what?

134
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:14,090
And then he like walked back over to them, walked over to the dad and the pretty lady, you know, his owner.

135
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:21,590
And then was like trying to get dad's attention and was like sniffing him and was like, hey, you know, I exist too.

136
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:25,970
And and then dad just kept ignoring the other dog.

137
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:31,710
And then like, you know, the terror, the terror, putteria was just like, no, don't ignore me.

138
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:32,690
Come on, let's play.

139
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:37,810
And then dad looked at and then dad looked at the dog.

140
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:39,410
He looked at it like that.

141
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:40,930
And then he like was like.

142
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,470
Like.

143
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:46,730
And then looked at the owner.

144
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:50,150
He's like, shush, the adults are talking right now.

145
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:56,130
It's like, shush, gone.

146
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:00,990
The adults are trying to talk, little man.

147
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:13,800
And I'm just like, Jesus, I'm just like, I'm like, Jesus, I'm sorry.

148
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,620
He's so, also, I think he's poop shy.

149
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:21,700
I think, I think he's poop shy when there's too many dogs, he refuses to poop.

150
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,500
And it's like, so frustrating.

151
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:29,000
Because I'm like, oh my, when there's nobody there, or like, he's just too distracted with the pretty ladies.

152
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:35,060
It's either he's poop shy or he's too distracted with the pretty ladies around whenever there's like other owners.

153
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:40,780
Anyway, but yes, that is the dad update for today.

154
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:41,800
Okay, alright, so.

155
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,880
I don't know if I'm gonna try it one shot the Onimusha.

156
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:51,320
So, because I did, you know, how long to complete this game.

157
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:57,300
And they said it's like, you know, five to eight hours depending on, depending on how fucked I am.

158
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,140
Um, so, and how difficult this game is.

159
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,420
So, I'm not sure.

160
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,760
So, we'll see how it goes.

161
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:09,220
We'll see how, how, uh, apparently it's this, they said this game is pretty short.

162
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,080
So, it's five to eight hours.

163
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:16,220
So, I guess it like takes, I don't know, but I'm very excited to play Onimusha.

164
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,740
I used to call it Onimushu because it sounds better.

165
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,580
I don't know, it just rolls off the tongue a lot better, you know, Onimushu versus Onimusha.

166
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:28,940
And, um, for those who are like, oh, you should have played Onimusha, uh, one.

167
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:29,680
I did.

168
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,280
You might have to look around for the archive of that.

169
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,180
You might have to.

170
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:42,700
But, like, I, I was very excited to find out that Onimusha 2 is finally coming up.

171
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,820
Because I actually, uh, grew up watching my dad play the Onimusha series.

172
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:52,340
And, um, and it was a game that I've always wanted to play myself.

173
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:57,560
And I always had nightmares of that one skeleton monster in Onimusha.

174
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:01,040
You know, the one, the one skeleton, you know, the one skeleton demon.

175
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,200
I used to have nightmares of that guy growing up.

176
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,860
Because I would watch my dad play this game at night.

177
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,660
Every day until he finished that game.

178
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:21,360
Um, but, um, it was, it always seemed like, I always wanted to play, uh, I always wanted to play this game, uh, for the longest time.

179
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,300
No, it was, like, the, the samurai, the samurai, what was this?

180
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,020
The samurai skeleton demons.

181
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,060
Uh, not the scientist skeleton dude.

182
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,320
It was, like, it was, like, they're, like, little demons, little skeleton demons.

183
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,700
And I had, like, nightmares about them.

184
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,600
Um, uh, yeah.

185
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:40,160
So, like, I remember them very, very vividly.

186
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:46,540
Uh, just like how I remember the monster in Resident Evil, um, that breaks through the window or some shit.

187
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:51,440
And, like, um, it's, like, a giant, like, uh, tank guy.

188
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,260
I don't remember which Resident Evil it was.

189
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,740
Um, but there was this, there, I remember, like, with the little ventilator thing.

190
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,800
Um, no, it's, no, not Mr. X.

191
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,880
He has, like, a little ventilator or whatever.

192
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,100
I don't fucking remember.

193
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,660
Um, was Nemesis.

194
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,220
Yes, I think it was, I have trauma with that.

195
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:16,140
Because my dad would, um, also make me watch him play Resident Evil, uh, growing up as well, like, in his bedroom.

196
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,840
Um, and I would watch him play Resident Evil as well, at nighttime.

197
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,180
And I also had nightmares about it.

198
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,220
So, I had a great childhood growing up.

199
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:31,800
Uh...

200
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,340
And, I had a great childhood.

201
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:35,440
Good.

202
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,840
And I would watch that at night while he plays the game at night.

203
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:46,880
But anyway, I do have more fond memories of Onimusha than I do of Resident Evil.

204
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:52,080
Because I actually really... I don't know, for some reason, that game was just very interesting to me.

205
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:55,540
As a little Doki, when I would watch my dad play the game.

206
00:13:55,820 --> 00:14:00,300
So I'm really happy that they did a remaster of the first two games.

207
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,840
Especially the first... because it was a game that I wanted to play myself.

208
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,120
By myself as well.

209
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,540
Because it seemed like a really, really fun game.

210
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,520
And I'm so excited to try it out.

211
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,200
I'm so excited to play Onimusha 2.

212
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,160
I think... I like...

213
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,220
I remember liking Onimusha 1 more than 2.

214
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,580
Just because the designs for me were much more memorable.

215
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:33,280
I just remember the designs and the environment was much more memorable to me versus 2.

216
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,960
I don't remember much of 2.

217
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,920
I just remember the guy has short hair now.

218
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:45,040
That's all I remember from the second game.

219
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,320
It's like...

220
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,040
The guy has shorter hair.

221
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,680
Yeah.

222
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,800
So...

223
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,440
So we'll see how it goes.

224
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,000
Alright.

225
00:14:59,300 --> 00:14:59,900
Let's...

226
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,960
Booting up the game for the first time.

227
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:07,040
Because I should really start testing out games before the stream starts.

228
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:11,220
That seems a lot smarter to do.

229
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,380
I don't know.

230
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,220
Is he like the son of the first one?

231
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:17,940
Testing games.

232
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:18,400
LOL.

233
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,700
Is he the son of the first...

234
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,160
Only...

235
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:22,920
The first guy?

236
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,480
I already forgot his name.

237
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,400
It's been so long.

238
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,180
Nope.

239
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:29,840
Different guy.

240
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,560
Unrelated.

241
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,620
They're unrelated?

242
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:32,480
Oh.

243
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,180
Contents of this game are presented with minimal changes.

244
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,020
Okay.

245
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:40,700
Powerbive.

246
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,500
Game supports.

247
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:41,780
Yay!

248
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,080
I love autosave.

249
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:44,520
Alright.

250
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,120
Let me make sure.

251
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,480
Alright.

252
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,240
You can review.

253
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,620
I totally read the private policy.

254
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,020
Alright.

255
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,260
Ooh.

256
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:53,960
That's loud.

257
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:54,740
Alright.

258
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,000
Let me fix the...

259
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:57,600
Okay.

260
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,400
Subtitles on...

261
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,240
Vibration.

262
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:00,560
Yeah.

263
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:00,960
Fuck it.

264
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,860
We'll do vibration.

265
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:03,340
Screen...

266
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:03,940
Screen adjust.

267
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:04,700
Okay.

268
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:04,940
No.

269
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,020
I need to do full screen.

270
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,380
Where the fuck is full screen?

271
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,140
PC settings.

272
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:09,920
Output.

273
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:10,580
Resolution.

274
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:10,920
Okay.

275
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,360
There you go.

276
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,160
Full screen.

277
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,020
There we go.

278
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:15,940
Uh...

279
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,100
Play on controller.

280
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:17,800
No.

281
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,580
There is sound.

282
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,500
It's just really quiet.

283
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,860
I'll boost up the sound right now.

284
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,000
Um...

285
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,960
I'm stupid because I forgot to use the bathroom before I...

286
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,200
I started.

287
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,420
I had to do work messages.

288
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:27,720
Sorry.

289
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,220
Alright.

290
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:28,760
Sorry.

291
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,780
Let me go use the bathroom real quick.

292
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,780
I forgot to use the bathroom before the stream.

293
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,600
Because I was at work.

294
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,140
Literally after the member stream, I had to do work stuff right away.

295
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,280
I'll be back real quick, guys.

296
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,040
Professional streamer.

297
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,040
I'm doing this for how long now?

298
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,900
Still doesn't test games out before you stream.

299
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,040
Uh...

300
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,860
And also forgot to use the bathroom.

301
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:48,520
Solid Snake, Medi, Floor, Mac, and Alan, Butter, and NS.

302
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,500
Thank you for the super chat.

303
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:49,860
Thank you.

304
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:50,220
Thank you.

305
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:50,440
Oops.

306
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:51,720
Oh, wait.

307
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,020
What?

308
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,140
Oh, special features.

309
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,600
Oh, what's this?

310
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,080
Difficulty.

311
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:56,720
Oh.

312
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:57,600
Alright.

313
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,320
Let me see what the special features are.

314
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,320
Normal.

315
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,240
Special.

316
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:04,820
Oh, man.

317
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,820
I'm going to put them on normal because I forgot what they look like.

318
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:08,920
Alright.

319
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:09,520
New game.

320
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:10,260
Mike.

321
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,400
Thank you for the super chat.

322
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:11,740
Thank you.

323
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,400
Thank you.

324
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,020
Exactly.

325
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,840
Why do...

326
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:21,400
Why test it beforehand when I couldn't have chat experience my ad-gross situation?

327
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,600
I'll boost up the volume a little bit for us.

328
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,020
Soon after his victory, Nobunaga fell...

329
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:32,640
I did that.

330
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,200
I did that.

331
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:39,700
However, Nobunaga was far from finished.

332
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,400
I did all that.

333
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,240
Of the demons, he rose from the dead.

334
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,180
Oh, no.

335
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,740
It's the mosquito lady.

336
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:50,900
Still pretty quiet.

337
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,400
Okay.

338
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,100
That was me!

339
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:03,700
Yeah,

340
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,820
how many times did we teach this old man a lesson?

341
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,180
Three more times.

342
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:11,980
Wait.

343
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:12,640
Two more times.

344
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,760
Because there's two more games.

345
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,760
I wish they do, like...

346
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,780
I wish this game had...

347
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,180
I wish they had more of this game.

348
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:35,530
Oh.

349
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,870
I need more samurai and demons.

350
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:45,270
I want an Inuyasha game.

351
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:45,990
You know...

352
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:47,090
That's...

353
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:47,590
I...

354
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:49,110
Oh my god.

355
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:50,310
Oh my...

356
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:50,970
Remember that...

357
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:51,250
There was...

358
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,010
It was a PlayStation Inuyasha game?

359
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,330
That game was so fun.

360
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:57,270
I remember playing...

361
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:57,830
I remember playing...

362
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:58,230
I honestly...

363
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,390
If any game we should...

364
00:19:59,390 --> 00:19:59,830
Uh...

365
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:00,350
Remasked...

366
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,790
If any game we should bring back...

367
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:03,330
We should bring back an Inuyasha game.

368
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:08,350
Oh, I used to play that Inuyasha PS2 game all the way to the end.

369
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,540
The one where it goes through the story?

370
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,020
No, no.

371
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:16,900
Not the fighter one.

372
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,700
The one that goes through the actual story.

373
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,600
Maybe an Inuyasha character?

374
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,480
Inuyasha?

375
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,400
I know there's also like...

376
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:28,800
What's...

377
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,300
Sishomaru?

378
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:31,540
Sishomaru?

379
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,920
You know which one's not my favorite character.

380
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,580
Your honor...

381
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,340
It's like...

382
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,920
This was basically pre-Edward...

383
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,480
Pre-Edward...

384
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,140
Uh...

385
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,180
What's his name?

386
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:43,760
Oh my god.

387
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,560
What was the...

388
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:44,640
What?

389
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,100
Jacob.

390
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,020
It was pre-Edward Jacob.

391
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,460
Before Edward and Jacob.

392
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,320
It's either Inuyasha versus...

393
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,420
Shoshomaru.

394
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,180
The OG Edward and Jacob debate.

395
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:08,670
Jesus.

396
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:09,930
Yeah, those are all demons.

397
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:12,730
Oh no.

398
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:16,830
No!

399
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,470
Japanese vampire!

400
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:25,110
How could you do this?

401
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:32,690
Just another Monday on Feudal Japan.

402
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:39,230
How could you just let this happen?

403
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:40,130
Oh no!

404
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:42,290
I was too busy talking about Inuyasha!

405
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:43,210
I...

406
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:46,830
I had my priorities straight!

407
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:50,410
Oh, that's fucked up.

408
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:53,110
Wait, he killed that snake for no reason.

409
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,180
I wish they would do like an Inuyasha game.

410
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,680
Donnie, thank you for the super chat!

411
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,500
Thank you, thank you!

412
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,740
A gift for you on my birthday!

413
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,160
Happy birthday, Donnie!

414
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,920
Happy birthday to you!

415
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,500
Happy birthday to you!

416
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,340
Happy birthday, dear Donnie!

417
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,900
Happy birthday to you!

418
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:18,460
Yeah!

419
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:19,580
Happy birthday!

420
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,880
Happy birthday!

421
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,520
No, that's not us.

422
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:29,680
Where the... where the guy with short hair... I actually don't remember these characters.

423
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,000
Like I said, I remembered one more than two.

424
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:41,000
No, we need an Inuyasha RPG... not an RPG, like, um...

425
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,680
What is it called?

426
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,620
Action RPG?

427
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,340
Like, where it's not RPG... not really fully RPG, but it's more like exploration.

428
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,720
Oh my god, I like this guy.

429
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,660
He has a gun.

430
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,260
Yeah, action adventure.

431
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,540
That could make so much money.

432
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,940
I've always enjoyed the story of Inuyasha.

433
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:21,460
You know, they made... they tried to make a sequel for... for... Inuyasha to talk about, like, their kids and stuff?

434
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,440
I heard it did really, really bad.

435
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:28,780
Cause, like, everyone was so hyped about it, and then there was nothing.

436
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,860
And then I heard nothing about it after that.

437
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:38,490
Like, I was like, wait, what happened to that show?

438
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:40,470
And I looked it up, and I was like, wait, it's done already?

439
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:44,530
I was like, yeah, I was like, yeah, I was like, wait, the show is done?

440
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:45,330
I...

441
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:52,430
A new warrior, Jubei Yagyu, heard about a demon attack on his hometown, Yagyu Village.

442
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:52,970
Huh?

443
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:58,570
Feeling the ominous presentiment in his heart, he desperately raced back home.

444
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:00,330
What?

445
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,980
Jubei, they're okay, right?

446
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,180
You think they're okay?

447
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,680
They're just sleeping, right?

448
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,960
Guys, don't worry, they're just sleeping.

449
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:28,880
Wake up!

450
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,540
Why are you sleeping?

451
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,000
Come on, don't be lazy.

452
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,740
Get up, it's work time.

453
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,070
Doesn't have a name?

454
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:48,170
Like, it's like, name, I know you and you.

455
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:49,730
And the third guy's like, hey.

456
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:57,690
Oh, my classic voice, 2000 voice acting.

457
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,570
How I missed you.

458
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,020
Jubei!

459
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:07,960
Jubei!

460
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,620
Who's there?

461
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,260
Come on!

462
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,980
Nothing bad happens to you when you listen to a voice.

463
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,620
Surely nothing bad's gonna happen to you?

464
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:25,720
Yeah?

465
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,880
Okay, let's see if there's...

466
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,980
Is there an audio slider?

467
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,740
Sound settings.

468
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:31,240
Alright.

469
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,800
Sound guy!

470
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:33,800
What do we do?

471
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:36,900
It's time!

472
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,160
There it is!

473
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,060
Thank you for the super chat!

474
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:39,960
Thank you, thank you!

475
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,880
Wake up Sam, right?

476
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:41,480
We got...

477
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,140
Dime...

478
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,340
Dimeyul to burn.

479
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,020
Alright.

480
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,320
Always listen to the voices in your head.

481
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,720
That tells you what to do.

482
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:53,340
Set...

483
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:56,200
No, we're not gonna set it tomorrow for the laws.

484
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,540
Bring down BGM by like...

485
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:58,940
Three.

486
00:25:59,140 --> 00:25:59,360
Okay.

487
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:00,720
Three ticks.

488
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:01,780
And bring up overall.

489
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:02,280
Alright.

490
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,300
Got you.

491
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,000
But how much though?

492
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,040
Okay, I'll bring it up here.

493
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,000
Alright.

494
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,780
Let me know if this is better.

495
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,840
Glad you're playing this game.

496
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,460
Don't get trivia.

497
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:14,980
I'm sure you know.

498
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,100
But Onimushu gave us...

499
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:16,480
Oh yeah!

500
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,240
No, I know that.

501
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:17,720
Yeah.

502
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,200
That's why a lot of the mechanics are very similar.

503
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,860
Okay, I'll save.

504
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,560
That's why you guys can tell that the mechanics are very, very similar.

505
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,760
But I know about that.

506
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,260
Let me run away from the boys.

507
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,460
Wait, is that not away?

508
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,420
Are you okay, bro?

509
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:44,730
But yeah, thank you in the super chat.

510
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:45,030
Thank you.

511
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:45,650
Thank you.

512
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,320
That's me.

513
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:55,560
Are you alright?

514
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,860
You need to get out of here.

515
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:02,660
Right there.

516
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:03,360
Hey.

517
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,160
Who did this?

518
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,440
Ah!

519
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,060
Jesus.

520
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:09,660
Whoa!

521
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,060
You think he's okay?

522
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,880
Oh my god.

523
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,060
What the fuck?

524
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,080
You're the ones who attacked here?

525
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:19,700
Okay.

526
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:20,860
I did not expect that.

527
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,040
For whom are you working?

528
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,520
Is he...

529
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,180
Is he okay?

530
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,720
Prepare yourself!

531
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:31,820
Okay.

532
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:33,520
Okay.

533
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,520
You're not gonna...

534
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,800
I don't remember how to play this game.

535
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:41,980
Okay.

536
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,240
No instructions.

537
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,320
Just slash.

538
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,580
Don't worry.

539
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,880
I have no instructions.

540
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,440
I'm just gonna keep slashing.

541
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:52,860
Whoa!

542
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,400
Whoa!

543
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:56,460
Okay, I'm gonna go...

544
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:56,600
Oh!

545
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,520
You're still alive.

546
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,620
Okay, are you dead yet?

547
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,180
Just like old times.

548
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:04,820
Choo-bay!

549

Choo-bay!

551
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,180
Okay, there's...

552
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,420
That's the pokey pokey.

553
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,360
Okay.

554
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,960
Bring down...

555
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,580
Sound effects by two ticks.

556
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,080
Okay.

557
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,040
I got you.

558
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,260
Alright.

559
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,060
Choo-bay!

560
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:20,920
Choo-bay!

561
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,060
Choo-bay!

562
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,460
Alright, and then bring up...

563
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,380
Uh...

564
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:25,820
Aurora.

565
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,520
Yeah.

566
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,860
The good old classic old games.

567
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,200
You just...

568
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,040
You learn by...

569
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,040
You learn by...

570
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,800
Trial and error.

571
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:37,740
Okay.

572
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,960
And then this is kick.

573
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,660
Wait, how did I kick?

574
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,480
How did I do that?

575
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,600
How did I...

576
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:48,420
Look!

577
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:48,960
Lady!

578
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,620
I'm trying to learn the controls right now!

579
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:52,860
No!

580
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,460
I need my game manual!

581
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:57,080
I don't have a game manual!

582
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,620
I don't have a game manual!

583
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,100
No!

584
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,640
That's not fair!

585
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,440
There's no game manual on Steam!

586
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:09,220
Yo, can you know what?

587
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,740
Dark Cloud is probably not a good game, but...

588
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,020
Um...

589
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:12,960
Awesome at the time.

590
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,560
Lucy, I'm thinking of the super chat.

591
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:14,920
Thank you.

592
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:15,560

594
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,380
Oh, there it is.

595
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,280

Okay, I figured it out.

606
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,220
I don't have to just do like...

607
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:40,400
You know...

608
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:41,400
Oh, shit!

609
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,160
Okay.

610
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,220
I figured out the controls, guys.

611
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,000

618
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:01,600
Oh, nice!

619

Press the...

620
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:03,460
Oh!

621
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:04,160
Thank God!

622
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,840

623
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,440
It is to open the map!

624
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,140
Thank God!

625
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,260
That's what I needed.

626
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,080
Where did I come from?

627
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:14,280
I...

628
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,260
I don't remember.

629
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,260
I don't...

630
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,340
Where did I...

631
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,080
Where did I come from?

632
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,740
Ooh, babe.

633
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:25,080
Okay.

Okay.

636
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,480
Where is this way?

637
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:28,480
Alright.

638
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,400
I have to go that way.

639
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,600
Where are they coming from?

640
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:41,580
Okay.

641
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,360
I don't know where they're coming from.

642
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:45,840
Alright.

643
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,940
I love...

644
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,220
I love fixed camera angles.

645
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:55,720
Jesus Christ.

646
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,380
I love fixed camera angles.

647
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,100

You're in the trees!

653
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,400

Oh!

657
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,320
That's convenient!

658
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:27,360
Don't wanna get my feet dirty with water.

659
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:28,700
I wanna...

660
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,820

661
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,200
Wet socks is not it!

00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:41,140
Always listen to the... to the nice lady.

665
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,960
If the nice lady tells you to go into the cave, listen to her.

666
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,500
Nothing bad can happen in the cave, right?

667
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,600
Kruger identity.

668
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:55,900

Thank you.

672
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,600
What's that sound?

673
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,820
I don't like that sound.

674
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:09,100

675
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:12,340

Thank you, thank you.

680
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,040
A voice in my head said to buy Doki merch.

681
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:22,700

00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:28,400

Welcome, welcome.

685
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:35,920
A voice in my head.

686
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,220
Into the goon cave I go.

687
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,660
The dragoon cave.

688
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:42,120
That looks like a nice place to hang out.

689
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:43,740
Doki!

690
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:46,940

00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,820
Oh my god.

00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,640
Oh, she's a god.

693
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,960
A demon.

694
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:06,250
Why hot?

695
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:38,950
I like how she was like a demon?

696
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,130
What the real?

697
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:41,790
If I called her a demon.

698
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:44,510
Oh my god.

699
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:44,710
Oh my god.

706
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,010
Charity?

707
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:12,530
Faith, honesty, respect, and strength.

708
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:16,270
Gather all the orbs and defeat Nobunaga.

709
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:22,180
You must go to the dragon shrine.

710
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,180
See, I told you guys she was friendly.

711
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:28,880
Then, you may take your quest to build mine in imagination.

712
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,760
When these mysterious women leave me alone in the cave.

713
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,240
They're always friendly.

714
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,060
You can do it.

715
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:37,780

Okay.

742
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:24,680
We'll re...

743
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,060
Press B to suck.

744
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:26,420
Okay.

745
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,040
Recovers help used to turn into Onimusha.

746
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,540
So they enhance from the magic.

747
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,780
Start infusing your gear with soul.

748
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,980
Each weapon or piece of iron requires a set number of souls to reach Use magic attacks.

749
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,360
Equip an Oni and press Y.

750
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:38,740
Okay.

751
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,360
Y...

752
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,060
B is suck.

753
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:44,920
Collect 5, then press L2 to turn into Onimusha.

754
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:45,260
Okay.

755
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,020
Using a charge attack.

756
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:50,260
Equip an unhold RT, then press X after a while.

757
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:52,660
Learning new skills.

758
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:55,620
Press while holding to cycles through...

759
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,420
Okay.

760
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,480
Quickly turn critic...

761
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:07,480
Press X right before it to hit and perform a critical.

762
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,040
Using press X while...

763
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:10,140
Okay.

764
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:13,860
Press right X before and to perform a...

765
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:14,120
Okay.

766
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:14,560
Okay.

767
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,640
That seems very...

768
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,160
Let's try this out first.

769
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,780
Let's try...

770
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,120
Let's try this...

771
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,200
This particular move first.

772
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:24,960
Okay.

773
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,220
Um...

774
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,060
All right.

775
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:27,900
I got this.

776
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,520
That's something very easily digestible, guys.

777
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,260
That...

778
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,680
That's you.

779
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,440
I definitely...

780
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,000
Look...

781
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,500
Suck.

782
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:37,700
Suck.

783
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:37,860
Suck.

784
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:39,640
Suck.

785
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,780
That's my favorite move in the entire series.

786
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,020
All right.

787
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:44,380
Let's...

788
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:46,120
Just baby steps, guys.

789
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,360
We're gonna try and get one thing done at a time.

790
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,160
All right.

791
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:52,140
And then turn down sound effects by one more tick.

792
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:52,500
Okay.

793
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,100
All right.

794
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,260
Can't be too hard, right?

795
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,700
Until I fight the boss.

796
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:01,870
All right.

797
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:02,210
All right.

798
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:02,750
Where are these?

799
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:05,710
Okay.

800
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:06,690
Okay.

801
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:07,370
That didn't work.

802
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:07,890
Okay.

803
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:08,510
We're gonna try this.

804
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:09,650
Okay.

805
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:10,650
That didn't work also.

806
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:15,390
Suck.

807
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:16,370
Don't leave.

808
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:17,170
Okay.

809
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:18,650
There we go.

810
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:20,550
Guys.

811
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:22,050
Apparently, I'm not gonna do that now.

812
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:28,750
Oh, shit.

813
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:32,170
All right.

814
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:34,730
Oh, no.

815
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:34,990
Wait.

816
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:36,050
Don't leave.

817
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:36,910
Suck.

818
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:38,070
Oh, nice.

819
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:38,950
That's a giant one.

820
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:39,930
That's a giant suck.

821
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:41,470
Absorb.

822
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:42,630
Guys, thank you.

823
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:43,250
Oh, shit.

824
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:47,650
Where are they coming from?

825
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:49,190
There you go.

826
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:50,750
Thank you for the Akasupa.

827
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:51,390
Oh, shit.

828
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:51,710
Okay.

829
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:52,870
I still...

830
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:53,550
I definitely...

831
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:56,310
I don't know how to do the critical attack, guys.

832
00:37:57,370 --> 00:37:58,930
I don't know when that happens.

833
00:37:59,130 --> 00:37:59,450
Oh, wait.

834
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:00,250
I can suck this.

835
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:01,410
Jesus.

836
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:02,450
Where did you all come from?

837
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:05,330
Okay.

838
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:09,070
I don't think I can charge it.

839
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:10,450
Yeah.

840
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:11,810
This weapon doesn't do charge.

841
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:13,470
Oh.

842
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:14,310
I could do this.

843
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:16,950
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

844
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:17,950
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

845
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:22,250
Watch me shimmy.

846
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:23,430
Watch me slide.

847
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:25,190
Slide to the left.

848
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:26,970
Slide to the right.

849
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:36,490
Okay, I'm trying to let... What's the first pre-RT in?

850
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:39,650
Alright, I'm moving.

851
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:44,510
Weird demon woman telling you to kill a revived Frutalord that died in this quest to unite Japan.

852
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:46,750
But you're too tired to go on this quest?

853
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:50,770
You score Doki Bird to get 10% off on GamerSubs!

854
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:52,930
To get that energy you need!

855
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:54,750
Gus, thank you for the Akasupa!

856
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:55,310
Thank you!

857
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:56,070
Thank you!

858
00:38:57,830 --> 00:38:58,970
Alright, I'm gonna go this way.

859
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:01,570
Okay.

860
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:04,490
This is the dragon that women mentioned.

861
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:05,790
It says, prove your identity.

862
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:07,930
Is it asking me to show the mark on my hand?

863
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:10,210
Take my hand.

864
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,110
Go ahead and thank you for the super chat.

865
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:14,190
Thank you, thank you.

866
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:15,250
What we learned today.

867
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:16,650
Jubei is our name.

868
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:18,190
Snake was our dad's game.

869
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:19,610
Thank you for the super chat.

870
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:20,390
Thank you, thank you.

871
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:20,910
Oh!

872
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:22,370
Did I learn a new comp?

873
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:24,510
Wait, my sword is so cool!

874
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,950
Oh my god, it's the official sword!

875
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:31,490
This is my new power.

876
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:34,150
Does this mean I got the Y attack now?

877
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:38,650
This is my new power.

878
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:41,810
He sounds like Dante's voice in the first game.

879
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:43,090
I will get my revenge.

880
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:45,050
You will pay for this.

881
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,430
Nobunaga!

882
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:49,330
That's sick.

883
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:58,810
In 1568, gold was discovered in the valley of Imashō, which is situated between Mino province...

884
00:39:58,810 --> 00:39:59,210
Me too.

885
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:02,290
I love... I love old game voice acting.

886
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:05,470
And the Echizen province of Asakura.

887
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:16,370
In no time, adventurers and merchants, motivated by greed, crowded into Imashō, transforming the small village into a prospering mining town.

888
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:16,950
Oh.

889
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:18,130
Hey, that's good.

890
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:18,610
See?

891
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:19,890
Demons aren't so bad.

892
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:21,770
I love it.

893
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:23,230
I think my favorite one is...

894
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:25,370
The first Resident Evil game.

895
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:26,730
It's like...

896
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:27,810
My sandwich!

897
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:30,090
Nooo!

898
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,350
I miss old voice acting.

899
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:40,730
Why would you show that to everyone?

900
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:44,370
Oh, I don't think he's okay.

901
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:46,330
Wait, what happened to him?

902
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:48,290
Wait, what happened to him?

903
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:50,650
A jesus sandwich.

904
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:55,690
Oh, I love House of the Dead.

905
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:57,110
You know like...

906
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:58,790
You know like they still make...

907
00:40:58,790 --> 00:40:59,970
House of the...

908
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:01,070
They still make like...

909
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:02,930
Don't you wanna serve me a little sake?

910
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:05,570
Oh, it's her!

911
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,400
I remember her.

912
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,260
Oh, she has the other...

913
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:16,720
Thing.

914
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,420
The other orb.

915
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:19,760
Woman!

916
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,280
I shall protect you.

917
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:24,840
Okay.

918
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:27,120
They're still making House of the Dead games.

919
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:29,460
And the voice acting never improved.

920
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:30,320
It's actually crazy.

921
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,660
I think they got like staff members to voice act for the game.

922
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,860
To save money.

923
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,020
There was a recent House of the Dead arcade machine.

924
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,160
And it's still the same voice acting.

925
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:40,840
Like...

926
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,200
Like the same...

927
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:42,460
Like...

928
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:43,280
Uh...

929
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:45,900
What's the word?

930
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,120
Campy voice acting.

931
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,480
It's like their thing now.

932
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,720
It's called style.

933
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,980
You don't understand.

934
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:56,700
Oh, hey.

935
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:58,720
You look...

936
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,880
Oh, I was gonna say a prostitute and I was like...

937
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,720
Am I allowed to say that?

938
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,620
I was like...

939
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:06,940
And it was one.

940
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:09,280
You looking for a good time, sugar?

941
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,000
No.

942
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,220
Well, your expression speaks volumes.

943
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,900
Come back if you change your mind.

944
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,240
I'll be here waiting for you.

945
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:20,260
Try to come up with something interesting to do later.

946
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,060
Okay.

947
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:21,160
Okay.

948
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,880
This town is still kinda new.

949
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,100
I'm sure I could make a ton of cash here.

950
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,960
The man who found the gold in the mine.

951
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,920
I knew he thought he was in heaven.

952
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,700
But it's pretty funny he actually went there.

953
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,100
Well, his loss is my gain.

954
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:41,040
You're looking for a woman?

955
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,900
Even with a fine specimen like me right in front of you?

956
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:45,820
Oh my god.

957
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:51,780
No women in town is more beautiful than I am.

958
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,940
Of that, I am sure.

959
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,060
Jakoto, thank you for this super chat.

960
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,060
Thank you, thank you.

961
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,860
Don't you play Onimusha 2?

962
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,220
The classic Capcom game?

963
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,160
Heck yeah.

964
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:04,560
The Onimusha series originally started as a feudal samurai Resident Evil.

965
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,460
Like how Devil May Cry started as a Resident Evil game.

966
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:09,040
So similarities are there.

967
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:14,080
It's surprising that not a lot of VTubers play Onimusha.

968
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,700
But everybody who keeps playing Devil May Cry.

969
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,260
I drank too much again.

970
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,940
I really need to start taking it easy.

971
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,900
I feel like Onimusha is a fun game.

972
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:28,940
The rooms upstairs will have free for you to use one if you want.

973
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,740
Can you believe this guy?

974
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,720
He's got no money, but he wants me to sell him my permit.

975
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,440
I'll pay you when I get my salary, please.

976
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,940
I need a permit to enter the gold mine.

977
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:42,740
For the gold.

978
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,080
Oh, I can enhance.

979
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:45,180
Alright.

980
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:46,820
Let's save real quick.

981
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:50,780
Alright.

982
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:56,600
I think Onimusha was a really good game back then too.

983
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:57,240
Similar?

984
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:57,700
Oh my god.

985
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:00,280
I keep trying to save game, but I'm trying to enhance my weapon.

986
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,120
Should I go straight into...

987
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:03,420
Ooh.

988
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,400
Will I get a better sword later?

989
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:09,620
Or should I just...

990
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:12,420
Should I get a better sword later?

991
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:13,340
Or...

992
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:14,640
Upgrade my better sword...

993
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,600
My better sword later?

994
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:16,700
Or should I upgrade it now?

995
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:26,900
I don't know if I should upgrade it now or not.

996
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:27,840
Or save up.

997
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:28,760
That's the thing.

998
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:33,220
I know I get different weapons, but I don't remember which one...

999
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:36,880
They all have their own strength.

1000
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:37,980
Okay, I'll upgrade for now.

1001
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:39,500
I'll upgrade it for now.

1002
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:41,840
Just in case.

1003
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:44,720
Ooh, a Kirisu.

1004
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:46,100
Suck.

1005
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,260
Wait, is that not for sucking?

1006
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,740
Oh, restore magic here.

1007
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:50,960
Okay, I was gonna be like...

1008
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:51,080
What?

1009
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,760
A statue of the god of the underworld.

1010
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:56,780
Instead you can see all the deeds from your past lives.

1011
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,880
I'm sure I've been a good person in my past life.

1012
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,040
Wait.

1013
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:04,220
I was gonna go...

1014
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:04,880
Up here.

1015
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:07,960
Alright.

1016
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:10,180
Oh, I got a floating fan.

1017
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:12,620
Where's my bed?

1018
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:13,520
Oh, I got a cat!

1019
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,100
A little cat!

1020
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:17,800
I can't pet the cat.

1021
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:19,560
Nine out of ten.

1022
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:20,680
Never mind.

1023
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:21,660
This remaster sucks.

1024
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,520
I can't pet the cat.

1025
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:31,140
Never mind.

1026
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:33,100
No wonder modern games are better.

1027
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:36,880
Can't pet it.

1028
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:37,160
Not.

1029
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,120
Why even play?

1030
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:38,600
You're right.

1031
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:40,520
Guys, we're gonna go back to Roblox.

1032
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:49,920
Sailor, if you're gonna go to the gold mine, I heard it's crawling with Oda soldiers.

1033
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:54,840
I'm gonna go up here first.

1034
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:01,380
What's up here?

1035
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:03,640
What the fuck?

1036
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:04,940
Oh my god!

1037
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:05,900
Excuse me?

1038
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,920
How is there people here now?

1039
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:13,180
Oh my god.

1040
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:13,820
Excuse me?

1041
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:14,660
Excuse me!

1042
00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:21,530
Oh no.

1043
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:22,090
Oh no.

1044
00:46:22,690 --> 00:46:23,750
Oh my god.

1045
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:25,110
Suck.

1046
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:28,550
Okay, I did not expect to see people here already.

1047
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:30,810
I just wanted to...

1048
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:32,710
Why are there demons here?

1049
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:36,110
Suck.

1050
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:37,050
Okay.

1051
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:39,290
Give me a sec.

1052
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:40,690
Guys, give me a sec.

1053
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:43,570
Okay.

1054
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:44,510
Let me...

1055
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:44,950
Oh nice.

1056
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:45,870
Give me a sec.

1057
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:46,570
Let me suck.

1058
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:48,270
Suck.

1059
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:48,550
Oh.

1060
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:51,190
Suck.

1061
00:46:55,510 --> 00:46:56,850
I gotta make sure.

1062
00:46:57,050 --> 00:46:57,650
Jesus!

1063
00:46:58,790 --> 00:47:01,490
How many people die in feudal Japan?

1064
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:03,390
Trick question.

1065
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:08,890
I don't need to ask.

1066
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:13,170
Oh, I got gold though.

1067
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:13,850
Yes.

1068
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:18,000
Are you serious?

1069
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,500
There's so many.

1070
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,520
At least there's a fast way to kill them.

1071
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:24,080
Thank god.

1072
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,140
I'm glad there's like...

1073
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:31,600
You can just do that.

1074
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:32,240
Yay!

1075
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:32,960
Money!

1076
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,960
Am I going the wrong way?

1077
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:40,740
Eh, whatever.

1078
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:44,200
Hello!

1079
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,240
Do you have a permit?

1080
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,340
Oh, this is the gold.

1081
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:50,700
Did you not just see the demons back there?

1082
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:51,420
Bro!

1083
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:55,060
What the fu- I just fought so many demons!

1084
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:57,040
Oh my god!

1085
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:58,360
And I gotta do this again.

1086
00:47:58,700 --> 00:47:58,940
Bro!

1087
00:47:59,040 --> 00:47:59,960
There's demons here!

1088
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,400
Oh my god.

1089
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:07,840
Okay.

1090
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:09,140
I'll fight here.

1091
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:18,040
Okay.

1092
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:18,880
Oh nice!

1093
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,020
I can actually use my electricity attack.

1094
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:24,380
That's good.

1095
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:27,060
What the fu- Where did he come from?

1096
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,060
At least I can farm like...

1097
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:30,540
Uh...

1098
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:31,040
Level up.

1099
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:34,660
Oh my god.

1100
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:35,220
Are you serious?

1101
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:36,000
Are you serious?

1102
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:37,780
What?

1103
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:38,740
That's fine.

1104
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:44,280
That's fine.

1105
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:46,940
I'm trying to remember how to do the charge attack.

1106
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:48,100
Correctly.

1107
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:49,820
Like that?

1108
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:50,840
Can I do it?

1109
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,640
Oh, I guess that's the charge.

1110
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:53,740
Alright.

1111
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:54,140
Nice.

1112
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:56,320
That's good.

1113
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:58,620
That's like infinite resp- Uh...

1114
00:48:58,620 --> 00:48:59,540
Infinite XP fire.

1115
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:02,060
Yeah.

1116
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:03,460
These guys are good for...

1117
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:03,980
Barming.

1118
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:07,820
Boom.

1119
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:09,680
Good.

1120
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:10,520
Slash!

1121
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:11,960
Okay.

1122
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:12,660
Chill.

1123
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:14,560
Your turn soon.

1124
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:16,760
Yeah.

1125
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:17,820
And I can grab gold too.

1126
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:18,620
Don't worry.

1127
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:19,260
I got you.

1128
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:20,500
Slash.

1129
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:24,530
That's right.

1130
00:49:25,310 --> 00:49:25,870
Slash!

1131
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:29,110
I found it.

1132
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:29,950
I figured it out.

1133
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:31,850
Infinite gold.

1134
00:49:31,850 --> 00:49:33,430
I don't need to go to the gold mines.

1135
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:35,230
I can just stay here.

1136
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:40,890
Why go to the gold mines when I can just stay here?

1137
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:43,910
Okay, let me...

1138
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:45,790
I think I can level up some stuff, right?

1139
00:49:47,570 --> 00:49:48,050
Slash.

1140
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:48,450
Slash.

1141
00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:48,930
Slash.

1142
00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:49,190
Oh, wait.

1143
00:49:49,330 --> 00:49:50,090
I've never been here.

1144
00:49:50,770 --> 00:49:51,490
Where's here?

1145
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:52,690
Hello, good sir.

1146
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:53,790
I don't believe we met.

1147
00:49:54,170 --> 00:49:55,490
This is a general store.

1148
00:49:55,790 --> 00:49:58,150
We sell all kinds of goods and trinkets here.

1149
00:49:58,450 --> 00:50:02,390
Please, take your time and see if we have anything that catches your fancy.

1150
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:05,990
Yes, you're looking for a special egg?

1151
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:07,130
Oh, this is just food.

1152
00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:10,610
A plank- plant encyclopedia?

1153
00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:12,050
Oh my god, wait.

1154
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:13,910
I want a parrot.

1155
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:15,870
What?

1156
00:50:15,870 --> 00:50:15,950
Yeah.

1157
00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:17,550
What do I do with it?

1158
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:21,310
Oh, I took his bird.

1159
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:23,230
I took his fucking bird.

1160
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:25,050
Shut up, idiot.

1161
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:26,490
Do you know who you're talking to?

1162
00:50:30,370 --> 00:50:31,330
Hello, doggie.

1163
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:35,150
I came all the way here.

1164
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:37,110
But someone else bought what I was looking for.

1165
00:50:37,270 --> 00:50:37,710
The bird?

1166
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:43,050
This woman told me she liked slim guys not too long ago.

1167
00:50:43,050 --> 00:50:45,710
My, what a handsome young man.

1168
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:48,970
I like myself a big tough guy.

1169
00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:51,750
And I'm sure you like the attention, no?

1170
00:50:52,270 --> 00:50:56,990
If you become fit as this guy, I'll be all over you.

1171
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,680
Can't pet the dog.

1172
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:03,360
8.5 out of 10.

1173
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:07,640
Alright.

1174
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:09,820
What do I do with a parrot?

1175
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:12,880
What do I do with him?

1176
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:14,700
I'll go back.

1177
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,640
I wanna see, like, if there's anything back here.

1178
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:22,910
Is there anything back here?

1179
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:33,690
This famous salt, which Kenshin Usugi gave to his arch enemy, Takeda.

1180
00:51:34,850 --> 00:51:37,110
Gotta line up everything nice and proper.

1181
00:51:40,450 --> 00:51:42,450
This is your first visit here, handsome.

1182
00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:45,030
Oh my god, the ladies wanna flirt with me.

1183
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:46,290
Oh my god.

1184
00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:48,770
I'm sure you like this place.

1185
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:52,790
I can sense an air of trouble around on the tourist trap.

1186
00:51:54,090 --> 00:51:57,770
I went on a spending spirit star and I got this as a free gift.

1187
00:51:58,130 --> 00:52:00,970
You can have it because it's not really my cup of tea.

1188
00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:02,890
Oh, it's ancient documents.

1189
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:04,070
What do I do with it?

1190
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:07,810
Oh my god, it is gifts.

1191
00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:11,430
Oh, wait, can I...

1192
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:12,950
Can I charm people?

1193
00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:15,790
Hey, where's...

1194
00:52:15,790 --> 00:52:16,850
Where is it?

1195
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:17,830
Oh, it's a gift.

1196
00:52:20,130 --> 00:52:20,570
Wait.

1197
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:22,350
Am I in a dating sim?

1198
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:25,110
That's my friend.

1199
00:52:25,330 --> 00:52:28,210
He was involved in a cave-in at the gold mine.

1200
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:30,670
Sonic Man, thank you for the super chat.

1201
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:31,750
Thank you, thank you.

1202
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:35,230
Oh my god, wait, I can...

1203
00:52:37,610 --> 00:52:38,990
Wait, I can have...

1204
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:40,570
I can have a...

1205
00:52:42,350 --> 00:52:42,790
Girlfriend?

1206
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:49,770
Oh my god.

1207
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:50,230
Oh my god, guys.

1208
00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:51,010
There's hope.

1209
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:52,830
There's hope for us all.

1210
00:52:58,440 --> 00:52:58,800
Or...

1211
00:52:58,800 --> 00:52:59,900
Oh my god.

1212
00:53:05,450 --> 00:53:06,870
Better than that.

1213
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:09,270
A...

1214
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:09,490
B...

1215
00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:09,930
B...

1216
00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:10,390
B...

1217
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:10,650
B...

1218
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:11,050
B...

1219
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:11,150
B...

1220
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:11,170
B...

1221
00:53:11,170 --> 00:53:11,210
B...

1222
00:53:11,210 --> 00:53:11,530
Boyfriend?

1223
00:53:11,790 --> 00:53:12,370
Oh my god.

1224
00:53:12,570 --> 00:53:13,450
A bro-b-b-bro?

1225
00:53:13,850 --> 00:53:14,750
Pull the handle?

1226
00:53:14,970 --> 00:53:15,150
Yeah.

1227
00:53:17,050 --> 00:53:18,350
Why not both?

1228
00:53:18,770 --> 00:53:22,090
We can have both girlfriend and boyfriend.

1229
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:22,790
Together.

1230
00:53:25,930 --> 00:53:27,210
Oh my god.

1231
00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:28,650
More options.

1232
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:33,430
We can have options.

1233
00:53:35,830 --> 00:53:37,150
Wait, what did us do?

1234
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:43,500
Where is that...

1235
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:44,680
How do I get to...

1236
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,220
Oh, I need a person over there, don't I?

1237
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:49,700
I need a second person.

1238
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,640
Enthusiast, welcome to the...

1239
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:53,220
Tomato farm.

1240
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:54,040
Welcome, welcome.

1241
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:56,480
Oh, is this where I...

1242
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:56,960
Oh wait, no.

1243
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:57,300
Okay.

1244
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,920
The fixed camera angles always fucks with me.

1245
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:05,480
There's no game does that anymore.

1246
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:08,220
Alright.

1247
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:10,680
That cloth.

1248
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:13,060
Wonder which one wants this cloth.

1249
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,160
It's been so long since I played a game with fixed camera angles.

1250
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:26,830
Alright, we gotta run.

1251
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:33,420
I still don't know how to do the critical attack, guys.

1252
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:41,350
Oh nice, what's this?

1253
00:54:42,050 --> 00:54:42,870
I got bow.

1254
00:54:44,010 --> 00:54:45,210
How do I use it?

1255
00:54:46,370 --> 00:54:47,110
Is that it?

1256
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:52,490
Okay, it seems really weak though, so I don't know.

1257
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:56,990
Wait, the original had tank controls?

1258
00:54:57,630 --> 00:54:58,050
Every...

1259
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:01,310
Uh...

1260
00:55:01,310 --> 00:55:02,490
Bro, every...

1261
00:55:02,490 --> 00:55:05,350
Every old game that had tank controls back then.

1262
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:07,390
Almost every old game had tank controls.

1263
00:55:10,270 --> 00:55:12,770
Just... It's a bit random, but you'll know when you pull it off.

1264
00:55:12,770 --> 00:55:13,690
Okay, I'm gonna try again.

1265
00:55:17,350 --> 00:55:18,030
Okay.

1266
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:26,780
Okay.

1267
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:32,280
I'm gonna save my...

1268
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:33,040
Oh wait, what?

1269
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:34,240
Whoa!

1270
00:55:38,610 --> 00:55:39,090
Oh!

1271
00:55:39,370 --> 00:55:41,070
Fantastic job, Toki!

1272
00:55:42,070 --> 00:55:43,950
How dare you to serve our time!

1273
00:55:44,330 --> 00:55:44,810
Together!

1274
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:50,620
Oh!

1275
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:55,860
That woman gave me the help sign, so I had to break things up between the two of you.

1276
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:57,700
Get over it.

1277
00:55:58,020 --> 00:55:59,260
Why is he like...

1278
00:55:59,260 --> 00:55:59,760
Western?

1279
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,720
Why does he have a...

1280
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:02,860
Seriously?

1281
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:04,160
Cowboy accent?

1282
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:06,280
Who'd want a red bald head like you?

1283
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:07,460
We're in Japan!

1284
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:08,660
We're in...

1285
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:13,680
Yippee-ki-yi-yay!

1286
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:14,260
That does it!

1287
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:15,560
Outside now!

1288
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:17,940
He he he he he...

1289
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:20,080
Like they say in Fudo Japan...

1290
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,420
Yippee-ki-yay!

1291
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:30,040
It's a Kansai accent, clearly...

1292
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,300
What's he gonna do?

1293
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:38,440
Deflect a bullet?

1294
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:38,700
Did it?

1295
00:57:09,310 --> 00:57:11,450
Born in Texas, Japan.

1296
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:15,630
Such trifle things.

1297
00:57:16,530 --> 00:57:18,090
And you are...

1298
00:57:18,910 --> 00:57:21,090
Jubei Yeggyu, the young chief of the Yeggyu.

1299
00:57:21,090 --> 00:57:21,810
Oh, that's me!

1300
00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:22,770
Jubei!

1301
00:57:23,830 --> 00:57:28,520
Hey, Jubei Yeggyu, who is master of the blade!

1302
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:32,600
It must be faith that three proud warriors meet in such a town.

1303
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:33,860
Austin Osaka!

1304
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:50,680
Is that it?

1305
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:51,840
Is that easy?

1306
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,500
I did it!

1307
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:54,400
I've... I've...

1308
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:56,380
Guys, discovered world peace!

1309
00:57:57,900 --> 00:57:58,660
Oh, nice!

1310
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:01,780
Give an item and you can expect something helpful in return.

1311
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:04,440
A mark will appear on the lure when you approach a character.

1312
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:06,620
Repressed to open your very choice gift.

1313
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:07,840
Didn't give.

1314
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:09,780
Do you want my parrot?

1315
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:12,360
Of course I'm gonna pick the guy with the gun.

1316
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:13,300
Like, what the fuck?

1317
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:14,860
Like...

1318
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:15,220
Here.

1319
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:17,520
You want my parrot?

1320
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:25,000
Why are you doing a parrot?

1321
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,240
Why would you need a parrot?

1322
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:28,300
Okay.

1323
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:30,400
It looks like he is completely...

1324
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:30,560
Oh!

1325
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:31,580
I received medicine!

1326
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:33,000
Look!

1327
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,040
He's a neat guy!

1328
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:35,980
Alright, wait.

1329
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:37,240
There's something I wanted to...

1330
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:39,420
Uh...

1331
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:41,800
I wanna look at my instructions again.

1332
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,380
I don't know how to do the parry.

1333
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:46,000
This one.

1334
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:47,620
Right before an enemy hits it?

1335
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:48,880
That shit looks so hot.

1336
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:52,040
Alright.

1337
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:54,300
Um...

1338
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:54,760
He's...

1339
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:55,520
He needed it.

1340
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:56,140
I don't know.

1341
00:58:56,260 --> 00:58:57,100
I guess he needed...

1342
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:58,380
Self-esteem boost?

1343
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,620
You think he'll like...

1344
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:04,380
You think he'll like this?

1345
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:11,870
Yeah!

1346
00:59:15,270 --> 00:59:16,530
He likes it!

1347
00:59:16,830 --> 00:59:17,990
His face does not...

1348
00:59:17,990 --> 00:59:18,250
Oh.

1349
00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:19,270
Okay.

1350
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:21,750
Well...

1351
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:22,890
Fuck you, I guess.

1352
00:59:23,050 --> 00:59:25,430
I gave you free stuff and you're not even reacting?

1353
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:29,840
I think he'll...

1354
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:30,900
I used in...

1355
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:31,200
Okay.

1356
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:32,440
What else would he like?

1357
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:33,920
Would he like cloth?

1358
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:40,640
I suppose it could come in handy.

1359
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:44,540
Yeah?

1360
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:45,640
You can use it to wipe...

1361
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:46,820
He frowns?

1362
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:49,660
Am I...

1363
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:51,380
Like...

1364
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:51,500
He...

1365
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:54,180
Ha ha ha ha ha ha...

1366
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:56,900
What is this hot cold?

1367
00:59:57,420 --> 00:59:57,940
What...

1368
00:59:58,700 --> 00:59:59,220
What...

1369
00:59:59,220 --> 00:59:59,260
What...

1370
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:00,100
I got that...

1371
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:02,280
What is this hot cold shit he's doing to me?

1372
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:05,660
What if I give it back to him?

1373
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:15,780
Oh shit, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

1374
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:20,840
You quietly take back the cameo.

1375
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:22,460
Why don't I give this to him?

1376
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:24,780
Do you want this gift?

1377
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:28,960
Oh, he did not like that.

1378
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:35,040
We just met!

1379
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:35,040
What?

1380
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:40,260
He starts to mope like a little baby?

1381
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:41,460
What?

1382
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:47,480
Do people not like free stuff anymore?

1383
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:52,700
Give it back.

1384
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:53,880
Give it back to me.

1385
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:59,840
I know there's like a healing thing somewhere.

1386
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:02,020
Where's the healing shit?

1387
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:02,020
Get it.

1388
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:06,480
Gifts are... Get a guide on gifts!

1389
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:07,700
Okay, alright.

1390
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:09,980
What do you think he likes, guys?

1391
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:14,060
Alright, we don't need him.

1392
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:17,620
Gifting is a serious... Alright, Doki.

1393
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:19,060
Don't fuck around!

1394
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:30,520
Wait, I still don't have a permit.

1395
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:31,640
What the fuck do I do?

1396
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:33,220
What?

1397
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:37,040
Maybe play hard and get seal off Magachi's bullet.

1398
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:39,240
Dorma, thank you for the super chat.

1399
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:40,220
Thank you, thank you.

1400
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:43,740
Oh my god, this is the real game.

1401
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:46,500
I'm trying to min-max my gifting right now.

1402
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:49,060
You think he likes to smoke?

1403
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:55,580
I want to brag, but I'm super into reading books and studying.

1404
01:01:55,780 --> 01:01:56,620
Oh shit, okay.

1405
01:01:57,220 --> 01:01:58,540
Oh, so you're into books.

1406
01:01:58,780 --> 01:01:59,680
Oh, oh!

1407
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:01,100
Okay, I got you.

1408
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:04,140
Oh!

1409
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:07,680
I've been looking for this book.

1410
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:08,580
Thanks.

1411
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:10,020
I'm doing it.

1412
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:11,000
I'm gift-maxing.

1413
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,300
I'm romance-maxing.

1414
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:15,880
Oh, a power draw!

1415
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:17,840
Okay.

1416
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:19,860
Then that means you want this one.

1417
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:21,840
I got it from the other guy.

1418
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:27,800
It would be better to read them all at once.

1419
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:31,880
What's this here?

1420
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:33,180
He frowns?

1421
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:34,580
Oh, I got wine though.

1422
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:36,380
Oh, I know who likes wine!

1423
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:38,080
You like to drink!

1424
01:02:41,380 --> 01:02:42,300
Italian drink?

1425
01:02:42,660 --> 01:02:43,120
Holy shit!

1426
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:44,880
Okay, you better like this.

1427
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:45,900
I love good drinks!

1428
01:02:46,420 --> 01:02:49,240
Yeah, this guy, this is from straight up Italy!

1429
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:54,060
Ooh, I got some more medicine.

1430
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:57,720
Alright, so you guys, I know how to min-max this shit.

1431
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:00,000
What do I do now?

1432
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:02,300
Ah, save after that.

1433
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:05,300
Enhance.

1434
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:07,780
Alright.

1435
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:10,620
I keep swapping.

1436
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:15,220
Alright, I'm learning, guys.

1437
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:21,060
I guess I'll head back and see if I can go back to the cave.

1438
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:23,960
Is there somebody at the second floor?

1439
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:26,300
Alright, I'll go check.

1440
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:30,880
I didn't check the second floor.

1441
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:34,420
Oh my god.

1442
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:36,200
Okay, there you go.

1443
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:37,640
I got a little lost there.

1444
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:40,860
Yeah, there's nothing in the second floor.

1445
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:42,580
There's my cat.

1446
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:48,040
That's the remaster.

1447
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:53,320
Talk to the MPs.

1448
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:53,940
Oh, this guy?

1449
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:56,260
Oh, wait, he's new!

1450
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:57,520
Oh, yeah!

1451
01:03:58,620 --> 01:03:59,380
Oh, yeah.

1452
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:00,960
I have the permit.

1453
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,000
I didn't realize he like disappeared.

1454
01:04:04,460 --> 01:04:06,640
Alright, now I can go to the caves.

1455
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:09,100
Alright, here I go.

1456
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:12,180
Sorry, I was playing the main game.

1457
01:04:12,180 --> 01:04:13,720
Okay, back to the side quest.

1458
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:14,620
Hahaha!

1459
01:04:15,620 --> 01:04:18,180
Alright, back to the side quest of this game, guys.

1460
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,940
Let me make sure I stab him real quick.

1461
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:29,460
I assume the red ones do more damage.

1462
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:34,120
Okay.

1463
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:36,480
Let's suck all this up, just in case.

1464
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:42,120
Boom.

1465
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:42,280
Boom.

1466
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:46,260
Okay, I don't know... at the moment, if...

1467
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:52,860
If... if I'm... if I'm in this animation.

1468
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:55,480
You know the one where I'm like putting the knife in?

1469
01:04:55,580 --> 01:04:57,080
If they can interrupt it.

1470
01:04:57,300 --> 01:05:00,600
I can't tell yet, because none of them have yet to try to interrupt it.

1471
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:03,420
Back to the minigame.

1472
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:05,680
The children yearns for the mind.

1473
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:10,520
Alright, get out of here.

1474
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:12,680
Nice.

1475
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:14,200
There's so much gold.

1476
01:05:14,540 --> 01:05:15,720
It's a nice farm place.

1477
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:21,740
Hello.

1478
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:23,940
There's my permit.

1479
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:24,600
You can go in.

1480
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:25,160
Yay!

1481
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:28,040
Alright.

1482
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:29,240
Let's open this.

1483
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:30,900
More books!

1484
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:35,260
More books!

1485
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:35,940
More gift maxing.

1486
01:05:36,380 --> 01:05:36,860
Monsters!

1487
01:05:36,860 --> 01:05:37,020
Monsters!

1488
01:05:37,220 --> 01:05:38,380
In the mines act!

1489
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:39,100
Monsters?

1490
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:40,620
A woman wearing armor went in there.

1491
01:05:40,740 --> 01:05:42,600
I... I... I tried to stop her, but...

1492
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:42,820
What?

1493
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:46,060
You mean the monsters that are in the pathway of the...

1494
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:49,100
The same monsters that are guarding this pathway?

1495
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:50,700
Oh, they're running down.

1496
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:50,780
No.

1497
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:51,740
That's not good for them.

1498
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:54,660
Oh, wait.

1499
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:55,500
The guard's gone.

1500
01:05:55,820 --> 01:05:55,980
Wait.

1501
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:56,420
I...

1502
01:05:56,420 --> 01:05:58,300
I bought a permit for no reason.

1503
01:05:58,680 --> 01:05:59,740
I bought...

1504
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:01,520
What the fuck?

1505
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:02,940
I could've just waited.

1506
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:05,580
I could've just waited.

1507
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:11,360
What was the point?

1508
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:11,460
What was the point?

1509
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:15,180
Yeah, I just...

1510
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:16,840
I needed to wait two more seconds!

1511
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:22,100
Okay, uh...

1512
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:23,240
Let's see if I can enhance this.

1513
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:24,420
Oh, not a lot though.

1514
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:25,600
Which way?

1515
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:26,500
Left or right?

1516
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:28,140
Go left side.

1517
01:06:28,940 --> 01:06:30,780
Left seems less dangerous, right?

1518
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:32,040
Whoa!

1519
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:33,280
I knew it.

1520
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:34,940
Nice.

1521
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,120
Whatever there are demons, you will find mysterious doors.

1522
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:43,020
The doors are protected by strange demonic creatures called mozun.

1523
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:48,320
A pupil of gill strings created the mozun from bright moss under the ground.

1524
01:06:48,540 --> 01:06:54,140
There are several types of mozun and their sole reason of existence is to protect the demon's secrets from intruders.

1525
01:06:54,580 --> 01:06:55,880
Humans are not allowed in.

1526
01:06:56,100 --> 01:07:01,000
However, they are weak against the only power and to be destroyed with the right type of weapon.

1527
01:07:01,340 --> 01:07:02,520
Oh, that's a story I have.

1528
01:07:04,940 --> 01:07:05,880
Oh, fuck.

1529
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:07,680
Um...

1530
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:12,470
My favorite.

1531
01:07:13,910 --> 01:07:14,590
Um...

1532
01:07:17,860 --> 01:07:18,940
Wait, what?

1533
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:23,100
Oh!

1534
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:25,500
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1535
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:26,700
I figured it out.

1536
01:07:27,020 --> 01:07:28,580
I love these puzzles, guys.

1537
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:30,300
I love these...

1538
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:31,560
I love...

1539
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:32,780
These are my favorite puzzles.

1540
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:37,200
I got the secret.

1541
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:43,700
There must be something in here, right?

1542
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:48,040
Fly to the right.

1543
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:49,840
Fly to the left.

1544
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:53,780
Oh, oh wait, hello.

1545
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:57,420
I wanna see what the hub about this mine was about.

1546
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:58,860
This place is a dump.

1547
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:00,400
Where is the entertainment?

1548
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:02,040
What is he like?

1549
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:05,240
Oh, I don't really have anything, actually.

1550
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:08,000
Yay, good.

1551
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:11,640
Oh, nice.

1552
01:08:11,780 --> 01:08:12,560
We needed that map.

1553
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:16,380
Okay, so this one's a dead end.

1554
01:08:16,380 --> 01:08:18,460
And I assume the top is where I have to go.

1555
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:20,860
Criss-cross now.

1556
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:23,680
Alright.

1557
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:31,800
I don't like it.

1558
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:32,580
There has to...

1559
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:35,780
I feel like something's gonna pop up and go ooga booga booga.

1560
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:41,710
Oh, there it is.

1561
01:08:42,850 --> 01:08:43,830
Fuck is that?

1562
01:08:44,130 --> 01:08:44,330
Oh!

1563
01:08:47,410 --> 01:08:48,090
Oh!

1564
01:08:48,090 --> 01:08:48,490
Oh!

1565
01:08:50,890 --> 01:08:51,570
Crocodiles.

1566
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:55,920
I knew it.

1567
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:57,480
I fucking knew it.

1568
01:08:58,240 --> 01:08:59,680
There's no way I...

1569
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:00,740
I knew it.

1570
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:02,580
I was like, I feel too safe.

1571
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:05,360
That makes no sense.

1572
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:07,200
What the fuck?

1573
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:11,440
Get outta here.

1574
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:13,640
Get outta here!

1575
01:09:15,180 --> 01:09:15,540
Suck.

1576
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:16,800
That's right.

1577
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:17,160
Leave!

1578
01:09:21,850 --> 01:09:22,510
It's this way.

1579
01:09:23,230 --> 01:09:24,330
Are they Kappas?

1580
01:09:24,710 --> 01:09:26,410
Uh, they don't look like Kappas.

1581
01:09:30,450 --> 01:09:32,190
Oh my god, they're blue, too.

1582
01:09:35,610 --> 01:09:35,970
Suck.

1583
01:09:37,490 --> 01:09:39,410
I was gonna say, how the fuck do you live that?

1584
01:09:41,110 --> 01:09:41,810
There's no way.

1585
01:09:41,910 --> 01:09:42,970
I don't think they're Kappas.

1586
01:09:43,510 --> 01:09:43,990
Wait, let me see.

1587
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:47,590
Oh, you thought you got me, huh?

1588
01:09:48,570 --> 01:09:49,650
That's fucking right.

1589
01:09:50,170 --> 01:09:51,890
I'll waste my magic on you.

1590
01:09:52,610 --> 01:09:53,670
Okay, I'll go down here.

1591
01:09:53,810 --> 01:09:54,750
I think there's loot down here.

1592
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:00,580
Yeah, they look like...

1593
01:10:00,580 --> 01:10:01,580
They just look like...

1594
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:05,020
Just like regular...

1595
01:10:05,020 --> 01:10:05,600
Alligators.

1596
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:08,620
That's right.

1597
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:11,640
So apparently this has infinity frames.

1598
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:12,620
Oh, they waited!

1599
01:10:12,820 --> 01:10:13,720
They're so nice!

1600
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,640
That's so nice of them!

1601
01:10:19,740 --> 01:10:20,380
Nice!

1602
01:10:20,980 --> 01:10:22,240
Thank you for waiting.

1603
01:10:22,820 --> 01:10:24,500
I really appreciate it.

1604
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:27,540
Okay, nice.

1605
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:28,740
I need the energy, too.

1606
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:29,520
Oh!

1607
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:34,100
Please form alive!

1608
01:10:41,790 --> 01:10:45,190
See, this is why I min-maxed my gifting to the gun guy.

1609
01:10:47,030 --> 01:10:48,510
Like the lizard people.

1610
01:10:50,550 --> 01:10:52,210
I gave you wine!

1611
01:10:56,260 --> 01:10:58,480
I gave you Italian wine!

1612
01:11:04,490 --> 01:11:05,730
That's fucked up!

1613
01:11:07,610 --> 01:11:10,030
You suck this while he does all the work.

1614
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:15,110
I'm ready!

1615
01:11:21,970 --> 01:11:22,570
I'm ready!

1616
01:11:26,830 --> 01:11:27,790
I'm ready!

1617
01:11:29,090 --> 01:11:30,610
You do the thing!

1618
01:11:30,790 --> 01:11:31,470
I do this!

1619
01:11:35,050 --> 01:11:36,630
He asked if I was ready!

1620
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:43,350
I just started blasting!

1621
01:11:43,930 --> 01:11:45,370
Please help us!

1622
01:11:46,190 --> 01:11:47,190
My daughter...

1623
01:11:47,190 --> 01:11:49,770
My daughter was kidnapped by monsters!

1624
01:11:50,330 --> 01:11:50,890
Wait!

1625
01:11:51,210 --> 01:11:52,030
Did you say daughter?

1626
01:11:53,470 --> 01:11:53,850
Ugh!

1627
01:11:55,190 --> 01:11:55,950
Sooo...

1628
01:11:55,950 --> 01:11:58,370
Emotional support too big!

1629
01:11:59,050 --> 01:11:59,990
Oh, of course!

1630
01:12:00,490 --> 01:12:03,650
I think she is the most beautiful girl in the world!

1631
01:12:08,820 --> 01:12:10,600
Of course he's interested now!

1632
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:11,280
He's like...

1633
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:11,840
W-w-woman?

1634
01:12:20,260 --> 01:12:23,360
Assuming this is the Tokugawa era, he ain't getting any more of that wine.

1635
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:24,200
Because the...

1636
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:26,680
Shogune almost completely shut off trade.

1637
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:26,800
Wait!

1638
01:12:26,860 --> 01:12:29,040
So that was black market shit!

1639
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:30,680
Velarius!

1640
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:31,780
Thank you for the super chat!

1641
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:32,280
Thank you there!

1642
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:32,900
I know!

1643
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:34,740
And then he didn't help me!

1644
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:36,060
Wait!

1645
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:37,200
What's on top then?

1646
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:38,780
If that was like part of the story...

1647
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:40,800
What was that?

1648
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:42,080
If that's part of the story...

1649
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:42,640
I'm gonna go back.

1650
01:12:42,820 --> 01:12:43,840
And then see...

1651
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:45,900
Where the top part is for...

1652
01:12:49,340 --> 01:12:50,980
I'm curious then.

1653
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:52,080
Mukulichi, you fool!

1654
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:55,280
I won't forgive you!

1655
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:56,840
Wait...

1656
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:57,220
What?

1657
01:12:58,740 --> 01:13:00,080
What's going on?

1658
01:13:01,660 --> 01:13:02,760
You're like children.

1659
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:03,400
Where...

1660
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:04,320
They're here now?

1661
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:07,900
Not yet.

1662
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:09,300
Where am I?

1663
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:12,380
I have to settle this first.

1664
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:16,100
Dream of becoming a feudal lord.

1665
01:13:16,420 --> 01:13:18,460
I'd do anything to make it happen.

1666
01:13:18,940 --> 01:13:19,460
Anything!

1667
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:20,720
Did I go the wrong way?

1668
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:22,720
That isn't walking the right way?

1669
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:23,320
Yes!

1670
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:24,800
The...

1671
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:25,500
The point is...

1672
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:27,360
Makuichi laughed on my dream!

1673
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:29,300
I laugh because it's silly.

1674
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:31,700
Jubei, what's your dream?

1675
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:34,040
I don't have a dream.

1676
01:13:34,180 --> 01:13:34,460
Ha!

1677
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:35,280
Jesus!

1678
01:13:35,780 --> 01:13:36,920
I will kill Nobunaga!

1679
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:39,020
Jesus, that's depressing!

1680
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:41,560
I've never been possessed by a vengeful ghost.

1681
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:46,140
A vengeful ghost?

1682
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:47,420
A vengeful ghost?

1683
01:13:47,420 --> 01:13:47,920
What do you mean?

1684
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:49,460
Makuichi!

1685
01:13:54,510 --> 01:13:56,070
I keep pressing the wrong button.

1686
01:13:56,230 --> 01:13:56,810
No, what?

1687
01:14:00,860 --> 01:14:02,920
Which way is the right...

1688
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:03,720
What?

1689
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:07,260
I keep pressing the other...

1690
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:09,240
How?

1691
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:13,560
Jesus, I am so confused.

1692
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:18,530
I'm gonna go back.

1693
01:14:19,070 --> 01:14:21,470
I think the other way was actually the...

1694
01:14:21,470 --> 01:14:22,510
The bonus way.

1695
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:28,160
Alright.

1696
01:14:32,490 --> 01:14:33,130
Okay.

1697
01:14:33,350 --> 01:14:33,550
Wait.

1698
01:14:33,770 --> 01:14:34,090
Suck.

1699
01:14:36,230 --> 01:14:36,870
Nice.

1700
01:14:38,910 --> 01:14:40,190
Let me suck first.

1701
01:14:40,650 --> 01:14:41,110
Nice.

1702
01:14:41,630 --> 01:14:42,110
Jesus.

1703
01:14:42,310 --> 01:14:42,710
Jesus, they're so...

1704
01:14:42,710 --> 01:14:43,290
Oh, fuck!

1705
01:14:43,590 --> 01:14:44,770
He came behind me!

1706
01:14:46,490 --> 01:14:48,430
It's like I didn't expect it at all!

1707
01:14:51,310 --> 01:14:52,050
Wait a minute.

1708
01:14:52,550 --> 01:14:53,310
Gotta get rid of...

1709
01:14:53,310 --> 01:14:53,990
Oh my god!

1710
01:14:54,130 --> 01:14:55,030
They just keep coming!

1711
01:14:55,850 --> 01:14:57,350
There's so many of them!

1712
01:15:01,150 --> 01:15:01,630
Okay.

1713
01:15:03,630 --> 01:15:05,230
I'm just min-maxing right now.

1714
01:15:08,210 --> 01:15:11,190
I also wanna make sure I have enough magic for the other...

1715
01:15:11,190 --> 01:15:11,990
For the boss fights.

1716
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:16,700
What are you doing?

1717
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:18,300
What are you doing coming back to me, huh?

1718
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:19,120
What are you doing?

1719
01:15:19,380 --> 01:15:20,720
You know what's gonna happen to you?

1720
01:15:24,630 --> 01:15:25,630
What's over there?

1721
01:15:29,620 --> 01:15:30,880
Oh, it was nothing.

1722
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:32,480
Oh, okay.

1723
01:15:32,780 --> 01:15:33,660
I should've just...

1724
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:36,040
So the other way was the right way.

1725
01:15:36,340 --> 01:15:37,340
This was nothing.

1726
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:39,540
What's this weapon?

1727
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:40,820
Ooh!

1728
01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:41,900
It's a spear!

1729
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:48,720
Ooh!

1730
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:52,760
Five Oni Orbs.

1731
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:55,500
I am descendant of the Onichi Hogan Clan.

1732
01:15:55,700 --> 01:16:00,920
Famous as a yin-yang master and a formidable strategist in Kyoto during the Heian Period.

1733
01:16:01,260 --> 01:16:05,520
The Onichi Hogan Clan, as the name implies, are descendants of the Oni.

1734
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:11,080
It's said that the founder of the Onichi Hogan Clan was entrusted with the five orbs of the Oni Clan.

1735
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:17,600
The five Oni Orbs are secret orbs that grant great power to those brave enough to stand up against the demon.

1736
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:22,560
The five orbs are charity, faith, honesty, respect, and strength.

1737
01:16:22,820 --> 01:16:28,380
He who took over the Onichi Hogan Clan had been looking for the five Oni Orbs for generations.

1738
01:16:28,380 --> 01:16:31,520
I finally found the charity orb in this gold mine.

1739
01:16:31,940 --> 01:16:35,900
However, the demons are all around me and will not be able to make it back alive.

1740
01:16:37,300 --> 01:16:41,980
Therefore, I have hidden the cherry orb, and I have left this memo for a brave warrior to find.

1741
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:44,600
Oh, so there's a... there's one of the orbs are in here.

1742
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:47,900
Also, I for... I know I asked earlier about...

1743
01:16:50,380 --> 01:16:50,820
Um...

1744
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:52,140
About, like, the sound.

1745
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:54,860
But I don't know what the sound guy said.

1746
01:16:57,660 --> 01:16:59,800
I missed out on what the sound guy said.

1747
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:01,560
If it was okay, or if I need to...

1748
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:03,160
Or if I need to fix anything.

1749
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:04,500
Whoops.

1750
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:09,700
Alright.

1751
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:12,480
Oh my god, the spear is so much better.

1752
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:12,800
Wait.

1753
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:15,560
The spear is really good against these guys.

1754
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:17,360
Holy shit.

1755
01:17:17,580 --> 01:17:18,720
Wait, this is so much easier.

1756
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:21,740
Alright, nice.

1757
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:25,460
What did my sound guy said?

1758
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:26,440
Is it okay?

1759
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:27,840
Or should I...

1760
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:29,080
Adjust it anymore?

1761
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:36,800
Uh, Jonathan, thank you for the super chat.

1762
01:17:36,940 --> 01:17:37,840
Thank you, thank you.

1763
01:17:38,180 --> 01:17:39,420
I'm just gonna run past these guys.

1764
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:43,880
For nearly two decades?

1765
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:46,320
I do not remember the name of this game.

1766
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:46,860
You know what?

1767
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:47,380
Fuck it.

1768
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:49,660
I can kill them.

1769
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:51,160
Oh, fuck.

1770
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:55,160
Get out of here.

1771
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:55,700
Get out of here.

1772
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:56,280
Get out of here.

1773
01:17:56,420 --> 01:17:57,220
Get out of here.

1774
01:17:57,580 --> 01:17:58,200
That's right.

1775
01:17:58,360 --> 01:17:59,380
I can thrust forever.

1776
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:03,920
Power up the thrust.

1777
01:18:04,820 --> 01:18:05,260
Boom.

1778
01:18:09,420 --> 01:18:10,160
That's right.

1779
01:18:11,940 --> 01:18:12,380
Thrust.

1780
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:12,900
Oh shit.

1781
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:15,940
There's so many of them.

1782
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:18,300
Okay, we need this.

1783
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:21,800
I'm just farming HP at this point.

1784
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:23,620
Did I kill all of them?

1785
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:24,800
That's right.

1786
01:18:25,740 --> 01:18:26,680
Can't get up.

1787
01:18:26,780 --> 01:18:27,900
Oh my god, that was a double kill.

1788
01:18:29,140 --> 01:18:30,300
Just that easy.

1789
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:37,280
You're still coming over?

1790
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:39,940
Have you not learned your lesson, old man?

1791
01:18:40,860 --> 01:18:41,660
That's right.

1792
01:18:43,140 --> 01:18:45,280
I don't remember the name of this game.

1793
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:46,600
I thought it was just a dream.

1794
01:18:46,740 --> 01:18:47,920
My brother and cousin shared.

1795
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:49,480
My quest is now over.

1796
01:18:49,780 --> 01:18:50,280
Thank you.

1797
01:18:50,820 --> 01:18:51,380
There we go.

1798
01:18:52,780 --> 01:18:53,260
That's right.

1799
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:54,360
I'll never stop.

1800
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:57,700
Yeah, loot.

1801
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:01,120
I need to use medicine.

1802
01:19:04,380 --> 01:19:05,300
Okay, save.

1803
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:10,320
Save complete.

1804
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:12,880
Enhance.

1805
01:19:13,140 --> 01:19:13,540
Oh wait.

1806
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:14,960
I wanna upgrade this.

1807
01:19:16,060 --> 01:19:16,560
Wait.

1808
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:18,480
What's this call for?

1809
01:19:18,580 --> 01:19:18,920
Wait, guys.

1810
01:19:19,860 --> 01:19:20,660
Oh wait, never mind.

1811
01:19:20,660 --> 01:19:23,480
I had a random call and I was like, what the fuck is that?

1812
01:19:24,180 --> 01:19:25,280
Oh, put the charity orb?

1813
01:19:25,540 --> 01:19:25,940
Yes.

1814
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:35,820
I was like, who's calling me?

1815
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:36,880
Text.

1816
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:43,860
Oh.

1817
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:46,660
Steam?

1818
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:49,280
Steam power?

1819
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:51,380
My Fudo Japan right now?

1820
01:19:51,380 --> 01:19:52,540
What the fuck you are doing?

1821
01:19:54,220 --> 01:19:56,400
How do I remain my Territor?

1822
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:06,740
That's me.

1823
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:17,540
We are looking for a woman.

1824
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:21,820
Guys, do you know where his...

1825
01:20:21,820 --> 01:20:23,420
Where do you think his weak point is?

1826
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:25,320
His exposed eye?

1827
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:27,180
That's where his...

1828
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:28,320
That's on his crouch?

1829
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:29,540
Or like...

1830
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:30,480
I don't know.

1831
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:35,880
The giant exposed eye?

1832
01:20:37,860 --> 01:20:39,140
Or his ponytail.

1833
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:39,740
You're right.

1834
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:42,400
Or you think it's his ponytail, guys.

1835
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:44,920
Surely not, right?

1836
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:45,640
Can I block this?

1837
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:47,020
Oh, I can.

1838
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:47,700
That's good.

1839
01:20:50,420 --> 01:20:51,060
Jesus.

1840
01:20:52,460 --> 01:20:53,100
Actually...

1841
01:20:56,940 --> 01:20:59,040
I just was curious about...

1842
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:00,160
Wait, how do I...

1843
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:00,960
How do I...

1844
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:02,520
Okay, there you go.

1845
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:04,060
That's right, it's time!

1846
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:07,200
That's right!

1847
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:09,920
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew!

1848
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:10,280
Pew, pew, pew!

1849
01:21:10,620 --> 01:21:12,580
Pew, pew, pew!

1850
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:16,260
I think that's the...

1851
01:21:16,260 --> 01:21:17,000
Okay, that's good.

1852
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:17,860
I can block that.

1853
01:21:18,140 --> 01:21:18,560
Jesus.

1854
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:23,120
Jesus Christ!

1855
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:24,700
Oh my god!

1856
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:25,680
Oh my god!

1857
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:26,320
Oh my god!

1858
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:26,880
What the fuck!

1859
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:31,800
Did you miss me?

1860
01:21:31,980 --> 01:21:32,580
Shoot him!

1861
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:35,720
Shoot him!

1862
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:35,880
Shoot him!

1863
01:21:36,700 --> 01:21:37,800
Oh my god!

1864
01:21:38,020 --> 01:21:38,600
Shoot him!

1865
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:39,720
Shoot him!

1866
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:40,460
Oh my god!

1867
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:41,600
Okay.

1868
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:45,920
Alright, we just need a little bit.

1869
01:21:46,220 --> 01:21:46,800
That's fine.

1870
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:51,060
All right, I believe.

1871
01:22:01,060 --> 01:22:03,360
I'll do one hit, and then he can keep shooting him.

1872
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:06,400
Does he die?

1873
01:22:11,940 --> 01:22:12,860
Jesus Christ!

1874
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:17,440
Does he die?

1875
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:19,800
Oh, he's sucking me!

1876
01:22:37,210 --> 01:22:38,070
Does he die?

1877
01:22:38,230 --> 01:22:39,050
There's no way, right?

1878
01:22:42,390 --> 01:22:43,350
I think he'll be fine.

1879
01:22:44,670 --> 01:22:45,670
He'll be fine, right?

1880
01:22:45,910 --> 01:22:47,110
He'll be so healthy.

1881
01:22:48,130 --> 01:22:48,850
I knew it.

1882
01:22:48,890 --> 01:22:49,730
I knew he was gonna do that.

1883
01:22:49,830 --> 01:22:50,890
I knew he was gonna do that.

1884
01:22:51,330 --> 01:22:52,910
He was so... I... Oh!

1885
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:01,540
How do you do that?

1886
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:13,220
Dude, just keep moving.

1887
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:14,180
Just keep moving, Doki.

1888
01:23:14,580 --> 01:23:15,660
Just keep moving.

1889
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:17,580
Just... Suck.

1890
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:22,200
Just that easy.

1891
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:23,560
Just...

1892
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:29,400
Suck.

1893
01:23:36,690 --> 01:23:37,690
Just keep thrusting.

1894
01:23:38,830 --> 01:23:40,010
Yeah, I'm ready.

1895
01:23:40,350 --> 01:23:41,050
I suck.

1896
01:23:41,710 --> 01:23:41,910
Oh!

1897
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:47,960
Get me out of here!

1898
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:51,820
Oh my god.

1899
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:55,200
I'm gonna use the sword.

1900
01:23:55,940 --> 01:23:56,380
Fuck this.

1901
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:58,240
Fuck this.

1902
01:24:04,250 --> 01:24:05,250
Fuck this!

1903
01:24:07,810 --> 01:24:08,770
Fuck this!

1904
01:24:08,770 --> 01:24:08,830
Fuck this!

1905
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:20,800
Okay, the sword was definitely way more effective.

1906
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:24,680
I should've been using the sword this entire time.

1907
01:24:28,620 --> 01:24:30,940
I wasted so much mint.

1908
01:24:31,220 --> 01:24:34,400
I should've been using the sword this entire time.

1909
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:35,800
Goodbye.

1910
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:36,640
Goodbye.

1911
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:36,960
Okay, bye.

1912
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:38,280
Thanks for the help.

1913
01:24:50,230 --> 01:24:50,530
Alright.

1914
01:24:50,850 --> 01:24:51,770
This is one of my favorite games.

1915
01:24:51,890 --> 01:24:52,230
Hope you enjoyed it.

1916
01:24:52,270 --> 01:24:53,510
Thank you to the super chat, Nito.

1917
01:24:53,710 --> 01:24:53,930
Thank you.

1918
01:24:54,050 --> 01:24:54,670
Thank you.

1919
01:24:55,870 --> 01:24:57,050
Brandon, thank you to the super chat.

1920
01:24:57,150 --> 01:24:57,390
Thank you.

1921
01:24:57,490 --> 01:24:58,610
Thank you, Pokebird.

1922
01:25:00,530 --> 01:25:04,590
Okay, I think the spear is good for, like, lots of enemies.

1923
01:25:04,590 --> 01:25:07,770
But the sword might be good for, like, boss fights.

1924
01:25:08,950 --> 01:25:09,470
Maybe.

1925
01:25:12,510 --> 01:25:13,430
Wait, are you okay?

1926
01:25:20,580 --> 01:25:21,460
Are you okay?

1927
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:22,880
Hey.

1928
01:25:23,700 --> 01:25:23,960
What's wrong?

1929
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:24,960
You seem like you're dying.

1930
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:31,480
Huh?

1931
01:25:34,020 --> 01:25:35,920
Wait, but you guys all seem so happy.

1932
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:39,540
You guys were like, good, yippee.

1933
01:25:44,660 --> 01:25:45,100
Here,

1934
01:25:51,850 --> 01:25:52,690
drink some water.

1935
01:25:54,630 --> 01:25:56,270
Where did I get this...

1936
01:25:57,030 --> 01:25:57,270
meal?

1937
01:25:57,850 --> 01:25:59,170
Oh, I took him home.

1938
01:25:59,370 --> 01:26:00,390
Okay, I was like...

1939
01:26:00,390 --> 01:26:02,530
Did I just bring this to the mines with me?

1940
01:26:02,830 --> 01:26:03,970
I feel fine now.

1941
01:26:04,650 --> 01:26:06,150
By the way...

1942
01:26:06,150 --> 01:26:09,270
The woman you were looking for...

1943
01:26:10,370 --> 01:26:12,370
Might have been taken into the hole.

1944
01:26:12,370 --> 01:26:14,790
It's like, here's my bento box I packed.

1945
01:26:15,730 --> 01:26:20,010
Yes, it's inside the gold mine, but the opening is blocked.

1946
01:26:21,230 --> 01:26:24,810
There is one way you can enter the hole.

1947
01:26:24,810 --> 01:26:25,350
It's the hole.

1948
01:26:25,690 --> 01:26:27,110
Where the gold is.

1949
01:26:31,130 --> 01:26:32,210
What the fuck?

1950
01:26:32,710 --> 01:26:34,270
Why didn't you give me that earlier?

1951
01:26:34,630 --> 01:26:34,770
What's that?

1952
01:26:34,930 --> 01:26:36,430
I don't know exactly.

1953
01:26:37,050 --> 01:26:40,270
But you can open the cover if you place this on top somehow.

1954
01:26:41,530 --> 01:26:44,570
I just found it lying around there and I kept it.

1955
01:26:45,570 --> 01:26:47,510
Like the ancient donut.

1956
01:26:47,830 --> 01:26:48,570
Please, take it.

1957
01:26:51,340 --> 01:26:52,760
Inside of the gold mine.

1958
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:53,840
Yes.

1959
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:57,200
I have to go now.

1960
01:26:57,680 --> 01:26:58,480
Thank you.

1961
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:00,240
For everything.

1962
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:01,620
No problem.

1963
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:06,260
You're giving me the ancient donut a little earlier, but that's alright.

1964
01:27:07,020 --> 01:27:07,980
That's alright.

1965
01:27:09,860 --> 01:27:11,120
Fuck me, I guess.

1966
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:12,840
Gotta go back into the mines.

1967
01:27:23,950 --> 01:27:25,710
Alright, I got the red ring.

1968
01:27:27,210 --> 01:27:27,650
Uh...

1969
01:27:27,650 --> 01:27:29,710
I like this during...

1970
01:27:30,490 --> 01:27:32,010
When I'm attacking the minions.

1971
01:27:32,390 --> 01:27:33,870
I think the sword might be good for the...

1972
01:27:34,510 --> 01:27:35,710
For the, uh...

1973
01:27:37,170 --> 01:27:38,550
The boss fights itself.

1974
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:40,010
Because that was such a waste of meds.

1975
01:27:40,630 --> 01:27:41,510
Door dash to the mines.

1976
01:27:41,610 --> 01:27:43,750
That would be 500,000 yen, please.

1977
01:27:44,170 --> 01:27:45,550
Door, thank you for the super chat.

1978
01:27:45,670 --> 01:27:46,610
Thank you, thank you.

1979
01:27:47,990 --> 01:27:49,590
Hey, I got more books for you.

1980
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:55,300
Wait, does he only like alcohol?

1981
01:27:57,260 --> 01:27:57,540
Sweet...

1982
01:27:57,820 --> 01:27:59,400
Oh, something sweet and alcohol.

1983
01:27:59,680 --> 01:27:59,860
Okay.

1984
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:01,720
I have more books for you, though.

1985
01:28:08,160 --> 01:28:10,700
It would be better to read them all at once.

1986
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:12,420
Yay!

1987
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:17,040
A wind bell.

1988
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:20,320
Let's save our game.

1989
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,360
Always keep saving.

1990
01:28:25,080 --> 01:28:26,560
I should be able to enhance, too.

1991
01:28:27,940 --> 01:28:29,180
Enhance the sword, then.

1992
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:32,700
I have to sort for, like, boss fights.

1993
01:28:33,260 --> 01:28:33,600
Oh, yeah.

1994
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:34,260
Give me a sec.

1995
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:35,920
Oh, wait.

1996
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:36,300
I forgot.

1997
01:28:36,540 --> 01:28:38,140
I have to adjust the sound.

1998
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:41,260
He said, sound effects down a tier.

1999
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:44,020
There you go.

2000
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:46,040
Oh, yeah.

2001
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:46,720
Give me a sec.

2002
01:28:46,900 --> 01:28:48,400
I have to check my email real quick.

2003
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:50,500
I got a voicemail.

2004
01:28:52,820 --> 01:28:53,520
Oh, all right.

2005
01:28:55,420 --> 01:28:55,940
Oh.

2006
01:28:57,500 --> 01:28:57,520
Oh.

2007
01:29:07,090 --> 01:29:07,610
Okay.

2008
01:29:07,770 --> 01:29:07,910
Yeah.

2009
01:29:08,050 --> 01:29:08,550
I'll do that.

2010
01:29:08,730 --> 01:29:08,870
Okay.

2011
01:29:09,010 --> 01:29:12,130
It's basically, I need a refill on the prescription.

2012
01:29:13,530 --> 01:29:15,690
So, let me check this real quick.

2013
01:29:16,210 --> 01:29:17,330
Oh and here..

2014
01:29:17,330 --> 01:29:18,490
Oh, my gosh.

2015
01:29:19,290 --> 01:29:19,810
Oh,

2016
01:29:26,990 --> 01:29:27,250
okay.

2017
01:29:27,250 --> 01:29:29,190
I can pick up any time tonight.

2018
01:29:29,330 --> 01:29:33,330
Alright, let me... I got to pick it up tonight.

2019
01:29:34,070 --> 01:29:42,070
Sorry, I just got the email, but yes, I can pick it up tonight.

2020
01:29:42,410 --> 01:29:43,390
If possible.

2021
01:29:44,310 --> 01:29:47,130
I just got the email and voicemail.

2022
01:29:47,610 --> 01:29:49,950
But yes, I can pick up tonight if possible.

2023
01:29:49,950 --> 01:29:51,690
All right, nice.

2024
01:29:52,070 --> 01:29:53,470
When did they send this?

2025
01:29:54,190 --> 01:29:56,710
What time did they send this email to me?

2026
01:29:58,230 --> 01:29:59,130
Oh, shit.

2027
01:30:02,670 --> 01:30:04,130
Wait, what?

2028
01:30:04,410 --> 01:30:05,330
What time did I reply?

2029
01:30:05,490 --> 01:30:06,130
Oh, okay.

2030
01:30:06,390 --> 01:30:07,410
I did not see that.

2031
01:30:10,490 --> 01:30:11,150
All right.

2032
01:30:11,530 --> 01:30:12,290
It was in the morning.

2033
01:30:12,430 --> 01:30:14,170
They called me today about it.

2034
01:30:24,950 --> 01:30:25,470
Okay.

2035
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:29,240
All right.

2036
01:30:29,540 --> 01:30:29,880
Nice.

2037
01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:30,300
All right.

2038
01:30:30,460 --> 01:30:31,000
I got it.

2039
01:30:31,380 --> 01:30:31,800
Whoops.

2040
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:32,200
All right.

2041
01:30:32,260 --> 01:30:34,760
I'll go pick it up tonight after the stream.

2042
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:36,160
Yeah.

2043
01:30:36,920 --> 01:30:41,280
Well, his meds are, like... He has, like, four more days of his meds.

2044
01:30:41,420 --> 01:30:47,040
So, like, I just want to pick it up in advance before, you know?

2045
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:50,200
Before he runs out instead of picking it up on the day he runs out.

2046
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:51,620
All right.

2047
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:52,460
Back to gaming.

2048
01:30:54,980 --> 01:30:56,320
No, we're not going to do it now.

2049
01:30:56,840 --> 01:30:59,700
The hospital... It's a 24-hour hospital.

2050
01:30:59,700 --> 01:31:02,060
So, I can pick it up whenever.

2051
01:31:03,820 --> 01:31:05,000
And he's cured.

2052
01:31:05,220 --> 01:31:07,020
Oh, that's so silly.

2053
01:31:09,580 --> 01:31:10,860
Cured forever.

2054
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:12,560
We're hopes and dreams.

2055
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:16,020
You still live in such a hopeful world.

2056
01:31:17,260 --> 01:31:18,440
A dual monster.

2057
01:31:18,780 --> 01:31:19,520
What the fuck?

2058
01:31:20,620 --> 01:31:21,980
Oh, new monsters.

2059
01:31:22,420 --> 01:31:23,520
Oh, these guys.

2060
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:24,800
I remember these guys.

2061
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:28,700
I hate it.

2062
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:31,620
These are, like, OG Devil May Cry enemies.

2063
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:34,400
They remind me of, like...

2064
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:35,100
Oh, there it is!

2065
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:35,720
I did it!

2066
01:31:39,140 --> 01:31:41,320
I don't even know how I did it!

2067
01:31:53,260 --> 01:31:54,780
I don't even know how I did it!

2068
01:31:54,780 --> 01:31:55,480
They cry enemies.

2069
01:31:56,620 --> 01:31:57,820
Yeah, I remember them.

2070
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:03,240
Yeah, yeah.

2071
01:32:03,660 --> 01:32:04,840
It's in the first game.

2072
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:07,100
Whoops.

2073
01:32:07,380 --> 01:32:08,540
That's not what I wanted to do.

2074
01:32:08,920 --> 01:32:09,780
Haha, whoops.

2075
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:13,140
Okay.

2076
01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:15,100
Nice.

2077
01:32:17,980 --> 01:32:18,980
Yeah, I got...

2078
01:32:18,980 --> 01:32:20,120
I did critical attack there.

2079
01:32:21,660 --> 01:32:22,060
Yeah!

2080
01:32:22,580 --> 01:32:24,860
More money to spend on gifts.

2081
01:32:27,100 --> 01:32:27,540
Yeah.

2082
01:32:28,120 --> 01:32:28,720
The puppets.

2083
01:32:28,860 --> 01:32:29,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2084
01:32:29,380 --> 01:32:29,860
That was...

2085
01:32:30,360 --> 01:32:31,120
Oh, my God.

2086
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:31,880
Are you hungry?

2087
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:34,660
Are you hungry, little guy?

2088
01:32:40,280 --> 01:32:41,340
Oh, my God!

2089
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:53,020
Oh, my God!

2090
01:33:01,900 --> 01:33:03,400
I'm so sad.

2091
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:05,600
No one's trying to feed him!

2092
01:33:07,620 --> 01:33:09,500
I can't check this monster fill mine.

2093
01:33:09,660 --> 01:33:11,220
If I had any unusual, let me know.

2094
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:13,880
Wait, what the fuck?

2095
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:17,540
They're just going to mine as if there wasn't monsters here?

2096
01:33:20,120 --> 01:33:22,360
What happened to the daughter?

2097
01:33:22,780 --> 01:33:23,840
No, you're right.

2098
01:33:24,220 --> 01:33:28,700
What happened to the daughter that I'm supposed to save?

2099
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:33,680
Feed him the daughter.

2100
01:33:33,820 --> 01:33:34,400
Oh, there they are.

2101
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:36,660
Oh, my God!

2102
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:38,140
It's just a giant eye.

2103
01:33:43,780 --> 01:33:44,820
Okay, nice.

2104
01:33:46,040 --> 01:33:48,320
I'm going to suck this real quick before...

2105
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:48,880
Oh, fuck!

2106
01:33:49,100 --> 01:33:49,260
Okay.

2107
01:33:49,640 --> 01:33:50,100
That's fine.

2108
01:33:50,380 --> 01:33:51,560
I got double attack.

2109
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:55,120
Wait, there's one more?

2110
01:33:57,640 --> 01:33:58,640
Okay, nice.

2111
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:00,640
Stab!

2112
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:03,000
Oh, nice.

2113
01:34:03,180 --> 01:34:05,540
And it gives me the Oni Musha.

2114
01:34:08,280 --> 01:34:09,640
Brandon, they give us super...

2115
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:10,080
Wait, what?

2116
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:10,820
What are these guys?

2117
01:34:11,080 --> 01:34:11,880
Wait, these guys are new.

2118
01:34:13,220 --> 01:34:14,080
Oh, shit.

2119
01:34:14,680 --> 01:34:15,600
These guys are...

2120
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:16,660
Oh, my God!

2121
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:17,360
They're strong!

2122
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:20,200
That's it.

2123
01:34:20,740 --> 01:34:22,400
I'm bringing the big boys.

2124
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:29,400
Oh, my God.

2125
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:30,480
I got the...

2126
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:31,440
I got...

2127
01:34:32,380 --> 01:34:34,000
Okay, I got to get this real fast.

2128
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:37,720
Yeah, these...

2129
01:34:37,720 --> 01:34:38,980
Like, the big guys...

2130
01:34:38,980 --> 01:34:40,460
I definitely need the sword for that.

2131
01:34:41,740 --> 01:34:42,680
Oh, thank God.

2132
01:34:42,680 --> 01:34:43,500
It gives me HP.

2133
01:34:46,580 --> 01:34:48,940
Yeah, I definitely need the sword for the big boys.

2134
01:34:51,340 --> 01:34:51,960
What the...

2135
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:52,920
Oh, it's these guys!

2136
01:34:53,660 --> 01:34:54,680
I remember them.

2137
01:34:54,980 --> 01:34:55,400
Oh, my God.

2138
01:34:55,460 --> 01:34:55,980
That was instant.

2139
01:34:56,180 --> 01:34:57,220
Wait, I did a critical on that.

2140
01:34:57,640 --> 01:34:58,680
I don't even know how.

2141
01:35:00,180 --> 01:35:02,400
I wish I had lock-on attack here.

2142
01:35:06,110 --> 01:35:06,630
Nice.

2143
01:35:12,170 --> 01:35:12,690
Okay.

2144
01:35:14,010 --> 01:35:14,950
Get in here.

2145
01:35:16,170 --> 01:35:18,410
Yeah, I didn't even realize I did double crit there.

2146
01:35:18,490 --> 01:35:19,010
That was crazy.

2147
01:35:19,390 --> 01:35:21,150
That was a crazy double crit.

2148
01:35:24,830 --> 01:35:25,910
Jesus, guys.

2149
01:35:26,130 --> 01:35:26,490
Chill!

2150
01:35:28,750 --> 01:35:29,850
Oh, my God.

2151
01:35:30,190 --> 01:35:30,950
Fucking chill.

2152
01:35:33,530 --> 01:35:34,770
Oh, my God.

2153
01:35:34,950 --> 01:35:35,710
You fuckers!

2154
01:35:38,090 --> 01:35:39,310
Give me the heals!

2155
01:35:42,030 --> 01:35:44,190
Oh, I don't even have full HP for that.

2156
01:35:49,020 --> 01:35:51,340
Yeah, it was definitely very hard to do.

2157
01:35:51,980 --> 01:35:52,680
I don't even know.

2158
01:35:52,860 --> 01:35:54,860
I definitely got lucky for that one.

2159
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:57,600
Yeah, I should be able to enhance now.

2160
01:35:59,500 --> 01:36:00,040
Come on.

2161
01:36:00,140 --> 01:36:00,440
Yes!

2162
01:36:00,740 --> 01:36:01,080
No!

2163
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:02,280
I was so close!

2164
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:02,700
Oh!

2165
01:36:02,940 --> 01:36:03,320
Wait, wait, no.

2166
01:36:03,480 --> 01:36:03,960
Did I level up?

2167
01:36:04,040 --> 01:36:04,760
Oh, no, I did!

2168
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:05,380
Nice.

2169
01:36:05,700 --> 01:36:07,460
Okay, and then I'll try and do...

2170
01:36:07,460 --> 01:36:09,080
I didn't hear no bell.

2171
01:36:11,680 --> 01:36:12,520
What the fuck?

2172
01:36:16,090 --> 01:36:17,190
Wait, how did he get here?

2173
01:36:20,130 --> 01:36:21,390
Yeah, I'm just going to use magic.

2174
01:36:21,610 --> 01:36:22,010
Fuck it.

2175
01:36:26,870 --> 01:36:27,230
Yeah.

2176
01:36:28,610 --> 01:36:29,350
No, actually.

2177
01:36:36,790 --> 01:36:37,150
Nice.

2178
01:36:41,270 --> 01:36:41,890
Oh, my God.

2179
01:36:42,090 --> 01:36:42,610
No, don't suck.

2180
01:36:42,830 --> 01:36:43,230
Don't get me.

2181
01:36:43,430 --> 01:36:44,710
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

2182
01:36:50,260 --> 01:36:51,700
What the fuck did he do?

2183
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:54,220
No, not again!

2184
01:36:54,520 --> 01:36:55,060
Not again!

2185
01:37:00,220 --> 01:37:01,000
Thank you.

2186
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:02,020
Thank you.

2187
01:37:02,180 --> 01:37:02,620
Thank you.

2188
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:03,000
Thank you.

2189
01:37:03,180 --> 01:37:03,820
Thank you.

2190
01:37:26,700 --> 01:37:28,240
What the fuck?

2191
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:31,680
I'm trying to get out!

2192
01:37:31,680 --> 01:37:34,140
It just keeps sucking.

2193
01:37:35,900 --> 01:37:39,560
I swear to god it was not intentional.

2194
01:37:40,300 --> 01:37:41,780
I swear to god.

2195
01:37:44,420 --> 01:37:46,700
It just keeps sucking.

2196
01:37:47,260 --> 01:37:50,300
It just keeps sucking.

2197
01:37:55,240 --> 01:37:56,660
Wait, there we go.

2198
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:57,360
We did it.

2199
01:37:57,560 --> 01:37:58,980
We did it.

2200
01:37:59,100 --> 01:38:00,920
Despite all odds.

2201
01:38:00,920 --> 01:38:02,900
We fucking did it, guys.

2202
01:38:03,780 --> 01:38:05,080
The suck of doom.

2203
01:38:06,620 --> 01:38:08,400
Despite all odds.

2204
01:38:14,030 --> 01:38:19,930
Okay, and then... Where's my fucking donut?

2205
01:38:21,810 --> 01:38:23,050
Oh, there it is.

2206
01:38:25,270 --> 01:38:26,890
Wait, I can use this now.

2207
01:38:29,050 --> 01:38:29,770
What the fuck?

2208
01:38:29,870 --> 01:38:32,230
Why didn't I give it to me automatic size?

2209
01:38:32,430 --> 01:38:33,210
Welcome to the...

2210
01:38:33,210 --> 01:38:37,350
Is that how you felt when you watched me get sucked three times in a row?

2211
01:38:38,590 --> 01:38:40,130
Welcome to the tomato file.

2212
01:38:40,470 --> 01:38:40,970
Welcome, welcome.

2213
01:38:41,850 --> 01:38:44,530
He's like, this is my time to remember.

2214
01:38:46,310 --> 01:38:47,430
This is it.

2215
01:38:48,770 --> 01:38:52,270
Oh, this is like where like there's multiple boss fights in a row.

2216
01:38:52,410 --> 01:38:53,150
I remember this.

2217
01:38:53,310 --> 01:38:54,390
Oh, I remember this.

2218
01:38:55,190 --> 01:38:56,550
Multiple like fights.

2219
01:39:10,570 --> 01:39:11,170
Yeah!

2220
01:39:11,170 --> 01:39:11,250
Yeah!

2221
01:39:14,750 --> 01:39:15,390
Oh, shit.

2222
01:39:15,770 --> 01:39:15,990
Wait, wait.

2223
01:39:16,170 --> 01:39:17,170
Whoa, we're starting now?

2224
01:39:17,330 --> 01:39:17,710
Oh, shit.

2225
01:39:17,830 --> 01:39:18,010
Okay.

2226
01:39:20,730 --> 01:39:21,450
I missed.

2227
01:39:25,110 --> 01:39:26,210
Oh, my god.

2228
01:39:26,910 --> 01:39:27,750
Okay, it's okay.

2229
01:39:27,850 --> 01:39:28,230
I'm okay.

2230
01:39:28,350 --> 01:39:28,710
I'm okay.

2231
01:39:28,850 --> 01:39:29,350
I swear to god.

2232
01:39:29,350 --> 01:39:30,570
I'm okay.

2233
01:39:34,310 --> 01:39:34,710
Alright.

2234
01:39:36,330 --> 01:39:37,030
That not it?

2235
01:39:37,130 --> 01:39:37,910
Oh, there was more?

2236
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:44,320
Oh, shit.

2237
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:45,960
I need to know his patterns or some shit.

2238
01:39:49,100 --> 01:39:49,500
Okay.

2239
01:39:52,790 --> 01:39:53,190
Nice.

2240
01:39:54,550 --> 01:39:54,950
Suck.

2241
01:39:55,870 --> 01:39:56,670
Oh, nice.

2242
01:39:56,870 --> 01:39:56,990
Okay.

2243
01:39:57,910 --> 01:40:00,350
Go steal your souls and try to want to take care of them.

2244
01:40:00,470 --> 01:40:01,050
Oh, they do?

2245
01:40:01,470 --> 01:40:01,830
Okay.

2246
01:40:02,110 --> 01:40:02,990
That's good to know, Brandon.

2247
01:40:02,990 --> 01:40:04,110
Thank you for the super chat.

2248
01:40:04,230 --> 01:40:04,430
Thank you.

2249
01:40:04,530 --> 01:40:04,810
Thank you.

2250
01:40:04,870 --> 01:40:05,490
I didn't know that.

2251
01:40:06,330 --> 01:40:08,250
There's a seal that I can't open it.

2252
01:40:08,410 --> 01:40:09,610
Just break it open.

2253
01:40:09,910 --> 01:40:11,130
Just pour water on it.

2254
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:15,640
Alright.

2255
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:16,500
Up I go.

2256
01:40:17,620 --> 01:40:18,500
Up I go.

2257
01:40:21,220 --> 01:40:22,080
Okay, nice.

2258
01:40:27,420 --> 01:40:28,000
Don't worry.

2259
01:40:28,820 --> 01:40:29,880
I know your pattern.

2260
01:40:32,460 --> 01:40:33,080
That's right.

2261
01:40:33,240 --> 01:40:33,320
Oh.

2262
01:40:34,300 --> 01:40:34,920
That's right.

2263
01:40:35,020 --> 01:40:36,080
I know your pattern.

2264
01:40:37,740 --> 01:40:38,260
Suck.

2265
01:40:40,380 --> 01:40:40,900
Alright.

2266
01:40:41,140 --> 01:40:42,500
I have demon form for this fight.

2267
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:44,780
So it should be alright.

2268
01:40:49,410 --> 01:40:49,930
Oh.

2269
01:40:50,450 --> 01:40:51,350
Where am I?

2270
01:40:53,830 --> 01:40:55,070
What is this world?

2271
01:40:58,170 --> 01:40:58,970
Doors locked.

2272
01:40:59,230 --> 01:41:01,170
Oh, I know this place.

2273
01:41:01,310 --> 01:41:01,850
I know this place.

2274
01:41:01,850 --> 01:41:01,870
Guys.

2275
01:41:01,970 --> 01:41:03,130
My dad got lost here.

2276
01:41:04,630 --> 01:41:05,730
He got confused.

2277
01:41:14,540 --> 01:41:15,560
Which one?

2278
01:41:38,520 --> 01:41:39,080
Oh.

2279
01:41:39,960 --> 01:41:41,980
You must have new wife and kids.

2280
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:42,980
It's the same for you.

2281
01:41:42,980 --> 01:41:44,400
If you should defeat Nobunaga.

2282
01:41:45,020 --> 01:41:46,920
Another will rise to take his place.

2283
01:41:46,920 --> 01:41:48,960
No, he'll just keep coming back to life.

2284
01:41:49,120 --> 01:41:50,140
It never ends.

2285
01:41:57,430 --> 01:42:00,470
Yeah, but then I'd be dead when it happens.

2286
01:42:03,230 --> 01:42:04,710
That's all that matters.

2287
01:42:05,690 --> 01:42:07,130
I'd be dead though.

2288
01:42:07,390 --> 01:42:08,910
So it doesn't matter to me.

2289
01:42:10,430 --> 01:42:11,010
Okay, nice.

2290
01:42:11,110 --> 01:42:11,890
We actually need that.

2291
01:42:17,190 --> 01:42:18,830
It's about like, you know.

2292
01:42:19,650 --> 01:42:21,970
Am I gonna be alive for it?

2293
01:42:22,750 --> 01:42:25,430
If I'm not gonna be alive for it, it's okay.

2294
01:42:30,050 --> 01:42:30,990
Jesus Christ.

2295
01:42:31,950 --> 01:42:33,990
Let me get that suck off first.

2296
01:42:38,540 --> 01:42:39,100
Please!

2297
01:42:40,380 --> 01:42:41,080
That's it.

2298
01:42:41,160 --> 01:42:42,340
I'm bringing the sword out.

2299
01:42:42,500 --> 01:42:43,160
I'm mad.

2300
01:42:46,020 --> 01:42:47,340
Oh fuck, JK.

2301
01:42:49,780 --> 01:42:52,860
Look, when I say that, it means I do better.

2302
01:42:53,880 --> 01:42:55,060
Oh my god.

2303
01:42:55,380 --> 01:42:56,740
Someone kill this bowman.

2304
01:42:57,540 --> 01:43:00,260
I can't kill him because I have to deal with him.

2305
01:43:01,380 --> 01:43:01,860
Okay.

2306
01:43:02,120 --> 01:43:03,840
If I'm down here, he can't do anything.

2307
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:06,620
Oh my god.

2308
01:43:06,760 --> 01:43:07,180
That's it.

2309
01:43:07,960 --> 01:43:08,560
That's it.

2310
01:43:08,620 --> 01:43:09,120
Give me a sec.

2311
01:43:09,500 --> 01:43:10,100
That's it.

2312
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:11,400
I'm bringing up my own bow.

2313
01:43:17,550 --> 01:43:18,870
He gets me?

2314
01:43:19,670 --> 01:43:22,470
He's so...

2315
01:43:22,470 --> 01:43:23,870
He's so hit!

2316
01:43:27,640 --> 01:43:28,280
Okay.

2317
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:29,600
It's fine.

2318
01:43:30,360 --> 01:43:31,000
It's fine.

2319
01:43:31,140 --> 01:43:31,900
Everything is fine.

2320
01:43:35,550 --> 01:43:36,370
Oh my god.

2321
01:43:36,430 --> 01:43:37,390
We actually needed that.

2322
01:43:41,130 --> 01:43:42,310
Wait, what's this?

2323
01:43:44,130 --> 01:43:45,590
What does this mean?

2324
01:43:47,650 --> 01:43:48,190
9...

2325
01:43:48,190 --> 01:43:49,190
14...

2326
01:43:49,190 --> 01:43:50,070
15...

2327
01:43:50,070 --> 01:43:50,870
7...

2328
01:43:50,870 --> 01:43:51,150
8...

2329
01:43:51,150 --> 01:43:51,450
9...

2330
01:43:51,450 --> 01:43:51,670
10...

2331
01:43:51,670 --> 01:43:51,990
11...

2332
01:43:51,990 --> 01:43:52,330
12...

2333
01:43:52,330 --> 01:43:52,570
13...

2334
01:43:52,570 --> 01:43:52,710
Oh!

2335
01:43:52,870 --> 01:43:53,130
15!

2336
01:43:53,370 --> 01:43:54,410
So he just has to make 15.

2337
01:43:54,790 --> 01:43:55,070
Okay.

2338
01:43:55,890 --> 01:43:56,430
3...

2339
01:43:57,550 --> 01:43:58,090
8...

2340
01:43:58,090 --> 01:43:58,410
9...

2341
01:43:58,410 --> 01:43:58,610
10...

2342
01:43:58,610 --> 01:43:58,830
11...

2343
01:43:59,610 --> 01:44:00,290
12...

2344
01:44:01,940 --> 01:44:03,200
No.

2345
01:44:04,020 --> 01:44:04,520
3...

2346
01:44:04,520 --> 01:44:04,960
6...

2347
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:05,340
7...

2348
01:44:05,340 --> 01:44:05,540
8...

2349
01:44:05,540 --> 01:44:06,220
9...

2350
01:44:06,220 --> 01:44:07,080
10...

2351
01:44:07,080 --> 01:44:07,420
11...

2352
01:44:07,420 --> 01:44:07,780
12...

2353
01:44:07,780 --> 01:44:08,540
13...

2354
01:44:08,540 --> 01:44:08,840
What?

2355
01:44:09,500 --> 01:44:11,080
This is 2, right?

2356
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:13,280
8...

2357
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:13,540
9...

2358
01:44:13,540 --> 01:44:13,880
10...

2359
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:15,760
11...

2360
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:16,900
12...

2361
01:44:16,900 --> 01:44:17,380
13...

2362
01:44:17,380 --> 01:44:17,520
Oh!

2363
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:17,820
Okay.

2364
01:44:18,120 --> 01:44:19,840
We'll put 8 right here.

2365
01:44:20,440 --> 01:44:21,640
4 here.

2366
01:44:22,320 --> 01:44:23,640
And then...

2367
01:44:23,640 --> 01:44:24,820
Wait, no.

2368
01:44:24,860 --> 01:44:25,740
That doesn't make sense.

2369
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:27,500
That's...

2370
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:27,860
Oh, wait, no.

2371
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:28,840
And then 2 here.

2372
01:44:29,340 --> 01:44:30,380
And then 6 here.

2373
01:44:30,580 --> 01:44:30,720
Yay!

2374
01:44:32,020 --> 01:44:33,840
I used my fingers to count.

2375
01:44:34,420 --> 01:44:35,380
I did it.

2376
01:44:37,300 --> 01:44:39,460
Does my spear also have...

2377
01:44:41,300 --> 01:44:42,320
Oh, yeah, it does.

2378
01:44:42,600 --> 01:44:42,760
Okay.

2379
01:44:44,160 --> 01:44:44,600
Nice.

2380
01:44:45,460 --> 01:44:46,240
Thank you, guys.

2381
01:44:46,660 --> 01:44:47,120
Thank you.

2382
01:44:48,460 --> 01:44:49,680
I'm leaving this area.

2383
01:44:51,880 --> 01:44:52,360
No!

2384
01:44:52,720 --> 01:44:52,880
No!

2385
01:44:53,080 --> 01:44:53,960
Don't bring me back!

2386
01:44:58,100 --> 01:44:59,000
Oh, thank God.

2387
01:45:02,490 --> 01:45:03,510
No, just suck him!

2388
01:45:03,590 --> 01:45:04,150
Suck him!

2389
01:45:04,370 --> 01:45:04,910
Just suck him!

2390
01:45:06,390 --> 01:45:07,270
Oh, thank God.

2391
01:45:07,450 --> 01:45:07,930
Okay, don't worry.

2392
01:45:10,090 --> 01:45:10,790
Thank you.

2393
01:45:13,250 --> 01:45:13,870
Oh, no.

2394
01:45:14,150 --> 01:45:14,610
No, no, no, no!

2395
01:45:14,950 --> 01:45:15,610
That's fine!

2396
01:45:17,980 --> 01:45:18,680
That's fine!

2397
01:45:18,860 --> 01:45:20,260
As long as it's not me!

2398
01:45:23,300 --> 01:45:24,220
As long...

2399
01:45:24,220 --> 01:45:26,540
As long as it's not me!

2400
01:45:29,380 --> 01:45:30,240
Thank God!

2401
01:45:31,980 --> 01:45:32,840
That's fine!

2402
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:35,380
I got saved!

2403
01:45:36,740 --> 01:45:38,120
Okay, I'll go right side.

2404
01:45:38,260 --> 01:45:39,580
Right side seems to have, like, loot.

2405
01:45:40,480 --> 01:45:41,540
Oh, never mind.

2406
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:43,360
Okay.

2407
01:45:44,540 --> 01:45:46,900
It's technically a G-Fu castle now.

2408
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:48,220
It belongs to the...

2409
01:45:48,220 --> 01:45:48,360
Alright.

2410
01:45:49,700 --> 01:45:51,120
Is that anything that he likes?

2411
01:45:51,320 --> 01:45:51,740
No.

2412
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:53,120
I think this is all for the...

2413
01:45:53,120 --> 01:45:53,840
For the lady.

2414
01:45:58,160 --> 01:46:01,180
Look, when he got him, I knew that I'm safe.

2415
01:46:05,840 --> 01:46:07,000
Like this?

2416
01:46:08,100 --> 01:46:08,410
Then...

2417
01:46:11,160 --> 01:46:11,780
No.

2418
01:46:12,220 --> 01:46:13,200
That's not it.

2419
01:46:14,660 --> 01:46:15,280
Fuck!

2420
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:16,060
Okay.

2421
01:46:20,850 --> 01:46:22,210
Oh, I fucked it up.

2422
01:46:22,210 --> 01:46:22,730
No.

2423
01:46:23,110 --> 01:46:25,750
Oh, how do I get this to the other side?

2424
01:46:38,190 --> 01:46:39,730
No, what do I do with this?

2425
01:46:39,890 --> 01:46:40,130
No!

2426
01:46:43,950 --> 01:46:44,550
Um...

2427
01:46:44,550 --> 01:46:44,930
This?

2428
01:46:45,310 --> 01:46:46,650
Oh, I'm so stupid.

2429
01:46:47,710 --> 01:46:48,310
I'm...

2430
01:46:48,310 --> 01:46:49,330
Yay!

2431
01:46:51,130 --> 01:46:53,050
I figured it out!

2432
01:46:53,570 --> 01:46:54,050
Yippee!

2433
01:46:56,330 --> 01:46:57,690
Yeah, I'll get that.

2434
01:46:59,890 --> 01:47:01,470
Yeah, you only have three moves.

2435
01:47:05,510 --> 01:47:09,330
I keep seeing that button is where I'm supposed to click.

2436
01:47:10,650 --> 01:47:12,210
Okay, there should be a heal here.

2437
01:47:14,250 --> 01:47:15,030
Never mind.

2438
01:47:15,230 --> 01:47:16,010
Oh, it's like...

2439
01:47:16,010 --> 01:47:17,210
This area again.

2440
01:47:19,010 --> 01:47:20,330
I remember this area.

2441
01:47:20,890 --> 01:47:21,390
No!

2442
01:47:21,830 --> 01:47:23,230
No, I need a sock!

2443
01:47:24,870 --> 01:47:25,430
Bro!

2444
01:47:27,850 --> 01:47:29,550
Oh my god, you fucked him up.

2445
01:47:29,670 --> 01:47:30,310
That was my XP.

2446
01:47:30,990 --> 01:47:32,390
That was my XP, bro.

2447
01:47:35,350 --> 01:47:37,070
Oh my god, you fucker.

2448
01:47:38,150 --> 01:47:39,470
You fucker.

2449
01:47:39,590 --> 01:47:41,090
That was my XP!

2450
01:47:44,840 --> 01:47:46,240
Here you go.

2451
01:47:47,200 --> 01:47:47,680
Nice.

2452
01:47:48,680 --> 01:47:51,260
Wait, you guys told me that doesn't...

2453
01:47:52,100 --> 01:47:53,460
You liars!

2454
01:47:55,880 --> 01:47:58,860
You guys told me I get involved!

2455
01:48:00,320 --> 01:48:00,740
Liars!

2456
01:48:05,720 --> 01:48:07,460
I'm not invincible?!

2457
01:48:11,900 --> 01:48:12,660
I'll...

2458
01:48:12,660 --> 01:48:13,880
I'll upgrade this.

2459
01:48:16,280 --> 01:48:17,800
Imagine trusting...

2460
01:48:17,800 --> 01:48:19,940
I thought I was invincible!

2461
01:48:23,180 --> 01:48:25,900
One tells the truth, the other tells the lie!

2462
01:48:26,660 --> 01:48:27,420
Fucking...

2463
01:48:27,420 --> 01:48:28,280
God damn it!

2464
01:48:30,840 --> 01:48:31,400
Okay.

2465
01:48:31,660 --> 01:48:32,560
Put that on.

2466
01:48:33,540 --> 01:48:34,540
Dragoo is lying!

2467
01:48:34,760 --> 01:48:35,720
They will never!

2468
01:48:38,980 --> 01:48:39,540
Okay.

2469
01:48:45,450 --> 01:48:46,290
Brandon, thank you!

2470
01:48:46,390 --> 01:48:47,150
Super chat, thank you!

2471
01:48:47,310 --> 01:48:47,870
Thank you!

2472
01:48:49,530 --> 01:48:50,290
Oh nice!

2473
01:48:50,410 --> 01:48:51,970
More books for my friend maxing.

2474
01:48:57,220 --> 01:48:57,780
What?

2475
01:48:58,140 --> 01:48:58,880
Are you okay?

2476
01:48:59,180 --> 01:48:59,460
Yeah?

2477
01:49:05,680 --> 01:49:07,360
Oh Jesus Christ!

2478
01:49:09,320 --> 01:49:10,160
That's fine.

2479
01:49:10,980 --> 01:49:12,880
You can do that while I do this stuff.

2480
01:49:16,340 --> 01:49:17,140
Oh wait.

2481
01:49:17,680 --> 01:49:18,080
No!

2482
01:49:19,480 --> 01:49:20,120
No!

2483
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:21,880
I'm just gonna do that.

2484
01:49:23,180 --> 01:49:24,140
Oh shit!

2485
01:49:24,300 --> 01:49:25,220
Wait, that's so good!

2486
01:49:25,620 --> 01:49:26,520
They locked him!

2487
01:49:29,880 --> 01:49:30,620
Nice lock.

2488
01:49:35,830 --> 01:49:36,610
Okay, nice.

2489
01:49:38,610 --> 01:49:39,350
What's this?

2490
01:49:40,010 --> 01:49:41,230
Wait, it's a baby!

2491
01:49:41,650 --> 01:49:43,290
Whose fucking baby is that?

2492
01:49:44,770 --> 01:49:45,630
Also, Syze!

2493
01:49:45,750 --> 01:49:46,370
Thank you for the super chat!

2494
01:49:46,470 --> 01:49:47,130
Thank you, thank you!

2495
01:49:47,250 --> 01:49:48,270
I just got free from working.

2496
01:49:48,410 --> 01:49:50,650
I was working with family and helped produce the game show panel!

2497
01:49:51,050 --> 01:49:51,790
Hope you enjoyed that!

2498
01:49:51,930 --> 01:49:54,090
You're very legitimate non-Google victory!

2499
01:49:54,830 --> 01:49:54,990
Yeah!

2500
01:49:55,750 --> 01:49:57,410
Wait, that's the daughter?!

2501
01:49:58,470 --> 01:49:59,050
Thank you very much!

2502
01:49:59,050 --> 01:50:00,680
He took a baby to the mines?!

2503
01:50:01,550 --> 01:50:02,050
What?!

2504
01:50:02,050 --> 01:50:02,590
What?!

2505
01:50:02,590 --> 01:50:03,710
You said daughter?!

2506
01:50:03,710 --> 01:50:06,690
You didn't mean baby daughter, did you?!

2507
01:50:07,250 --> 01:50:09,470
Why they took a baby to the mines?!

2508
01:50:12,870 --> 01:50:14,330
They yearn... sorry for...

2509
01:50:14,330 --> 01:50:14,990
Oh, you're right!

2510
01:50:15,090 --> 01:50:16,230
They yearn for the mines!

2511
01:50:16,390 --> 01:50:17,110
They get them young!

2512
01:50:23,250 --> 01:50:24,770
Start them young!

2513
01:50:28,150 --> 01:50:30,070
Take your baby to work day!

2514
01:50:32,390 --> 01:50:36,570
Aw, he's getting PTSD from his dead baby!

2515
01:50:39,870 --> 01:50:41,370
What the fuck?!

2516
01:50:41,610 --> 01:50:42,530
My daughter!

2517
01:50:42,890 --> 01:50:43,490
What?

2518
01:50:46,440 --> 01:50:48,460
When the castle fell...

2519
01:50:48,460 --> 01:50:51,020
My daughter was crying like this!

2520
01:50:51,680 --> 01:50:53,840
I did everything I could to rescue her!

2521
01:50:53,960 --> 01:50:54,680
Bro...

2522
01:50:54,680 --> 01:50:55,820
Uh-oh...

2523
01:51:03,480 --> 01:51:05,540
He has to take his men!

2524
01:51:08,180 --> 01:51:08,860
Aw...

2525
01:51:08,860 --> 01:51:09,100
Aw...

2526
01:51:09,100 --> 01:51:09,580
Eke...

2527
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:12,280
When she was born...

2528
01:51:12,280 --> 01:51:14,620
I promised her...

2529
01:51:14,620 --> 01:51:16,640
When she grew up...

2530
01:51:16,640 --> 01:51:18,380
I would become a feudal lord...

2531
01:51:18,380 --> 01:51:20,900
And make her a princess...

2532
01:51:21,680 --> 01:51:22,360
Aw...

2533
01:51:23,340 --> 01:51:25,800
That's why he wants to become a feudal lord!

2534
01:51:25,800 --> 01:51:26,440
Okay...

2535
01:51:39,740 --> 01:51:40,260
Alright...

2536
01:51:40,260 --> 01:51:43,580
You have your baby back while I went through traumatic PTSD!

2537
01:51:46,120 --> 01:51:47,940
Don't put her near any fires!

2538
01:51:49,980 --> 01:51:52,980
Like I just stood there while his daughter was just like...

2539
01:51:52,980 --> 01:51:53,980
Yoinked from his hands!

2540
01:51:55,160 --> 01:51:57,900
Who's gonna protect that guy from the demon infested castle?

2541
01:51:58,020 --> 01:51:58,640
Are we just...

2542
01:51:58,640 --> 01:51:59,360
Not...

2543
01:51:59,360 --> 01:51:59,740
Hello?

2544
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:02,460
Did we not just fight like hundreds of demons?

2545
01:52:02,460 --> 01:52:03,340
Like...

2546
01:52:03,340 --> 01:52:04,220
Is no one gonna...

2547
01:52:04,220 --> 01:52:04,840
Haha...

2548
01:52:04,840 --> 01:52:05,720
No one gonna...

2549
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:08,780
Escort him out of this demon infested area?

2550
01:52:09,680 --> 01:52:10,480
Like...

2551
01:52:10,480 --> 01:52:10,640
He...

2552
01:52:10,640 --> 01:52:12,580
Don't worry Toki...

2553
01:52:12,580 --> 01:52:13,960
He can handle it!

2554
01:52:17,780 --> 01:52:18,580
Haha...

2555
01:52:18,580 --> 01:52:20,160
Out of sight...

2556
01:52:20,160 --> 01:52:21,380
Out of mind...

2557
01:52:21,380 --> 01:52:21,800
Like...

2558
01:52:21,800 --> 01:52:22,200
You know...

2559
01:52:22,200 --> 01:52:22,860
I thought...

2560
01:52:22,860 --> 01:52:24,000
One of us would...

2561
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:25,260
Escort him...

2562
01:52:25,260 --> 01:52:26,020
I guess...

2563
01:52:26,020 --> 01:52:27,820
But I'm asking too much!

2564
01:52:28,260 --> 01:52:29,060
Haha...

2565
01:52:32,540 --> 01:52:33,900
Oh nice...

2566
01:52:34,020 --> 01:52:34,920
Oh I must have...

2567
01:52:34,920 --> 01:52:36,020
I might have messed up some...

2568
01:52:36,020 --> 01:52:37,110
Shiny eye objects...

2569
01:52:38,700 --> 01:52:39,160
Maybe...

2570
01:52:41,100 --> 01:52:41,560
Actually...

2571
01:52:44,500 --> 01:52:45,880
Shiny eye use the spear?

2572
01:52:46,300 --> 01:52:47,320
Maybe the spear?

2573
01:52:54,340 --> 01:52:54,720
Maybe the spear...

2574
01:52:54,720 --> 01:52:55,780
Is that opening?

2575
01:52:56,120 --> 01:52:56,800
Oh my god!

2576
01:52:56,940 --> 01:52:57,420
What the fuck!

2577
01:52:57,520 --> 01:52:58,460
Where did you come from?

2578
01:52:58,800 --> 01:52:59,680
Hello sir!

2579
01:53:06,380 --> 01:53:06,840
Alright...

2580
01:53:09,890 --> 01:53:11,170
Match the color?

2581
01:53:13,530 --> 01:53:14,170
Match the color?

2582
01:53:14,170 --> 01:53:14,570
What color?

2583
01:53:18,620 --> 01:53:20,120
Am I not...

2584
01:53:20,120 --> 01:53:22,240
Do I not have anything for this?

2585
01:53:28,060 --> 01:53:29,500
Actually I don't know...

2586
01:53:30,040 --> 01:53:31,640
I don't have any other weapon though...

2587
01:53:35,260 --> 01:53:35,860
Not yet?

2588
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:37,040
Oh...

2589
01:53:37,040 --> 01:53:38,180
Where do I go?

2590
01:53:38,180 --> 01:53:38,460
Oh...

2591
01:53:38,460 --> 01:53:38,660
Oh...

2592
01:53:38,660 --> 01:53:40,100
There's an area right here...

2593
01:53:40,100 --> 01:53:40,940
Okay...

2594
01:53:40,940 --> 01:53:42,700
I guess I need to find a different weapon...

2595
01:53:43,260 --> 01:53:43,700
Yeah...

2596
01:53:43,700 --> 01:53:45,180
I was gonna sit like...

2597
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:47,180
Oh this fucker...

2598
01:53:50,100 --> 01:53:50,980
This fucker...

2599
01:53:50,980 --> 01:53:52,180
Get out of here...

2600
01:53:52,700 --> 01:53:53,760
Get out of here!

2601
01:53:55,540 --> 01:53:55,980
Yeah...

2602
01:53:55,980 --> 01:53:58,000
I don't think I have a weapon for it yet...

2603
01:53:58,000 --> 01:53:59,420
Oh wait...

2604
01:53:59,420 --> 01:53:59,780
Alright...

2605
01:53:59,780 --> 01:54:00,100
Don't worry...

2606
01:54:00,100 --> 01:54:02,180
I trust him...

2607
01:54:03,260 --> 01:54:04,300
Are you ready?

2608
01:54:04,520 --> 01:54:04,740
Ready?

2609
01:54:05,500 --> 01:54:06,280
Free loot!

2610
01:54:06,760 --> 01:54:07,520
Free loot!

2611
01:54:07,840 --> 01:54:08,200
Free loot!

2612
01:54:10,120 --> 01:54:10,760
Yeah...

2613
01:54:10,760 --> 01:54:11,180
I'm ready!

2614
01:54:14,600 --> 01:54:15,240
Yeah...

2615
01:54:17,880 --> 01:54:18,940
Free suck!

2616
01:54:19,160 --> 01:54:19,740
Let's go!

2617
01:54:20,700 --> 01:54:21,580
Come on!

2618
01:54:21,780 --> 01:54:22,320
I'm ready!

2619
01:54:22,420 --> 01:54:23,000
Where are you?

2620
01:54:23,680 --> 01:54:24,320
Wait...

2621
01:54:24,320 --> 01:54:24,780
Is he dead?

2622
01:54:25,220 --> 01:54:25,640
No...

2623
01:54:25,640 --> 01:54:27,400
He's still shooting him...

2624
01:54:27,400 --> 01:54:28,520
Ready to get loot!

2625
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:30,840
Yeah...

2626
01:54:31,510 --> 01:54:32,120
Alright...

2627
01:54:32,120 --> 01:54:32,980
I'm done...

2628
01:54:32,980 --> 01:54:34,680
I'm done looting...

2629
01:54:36,460 --> 01:54:37,680
Jesus...

2630
01:54:37,680 --> 01:54:37,920
Okay...

2631
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:39,920
There's a lot of people there...

2632
01:54:41,520 --> 01:54:42,360
Okay...

2633
01:54:42,360 --> 01:54:43,140
I wanna...

2634
01:54:43,140 --> 01:54:44,040
God damn it!

2635
01:54:48,140 --> 01:54:49,450
Stop dodging!

2636
01:54:51,840 --> 01:54:52,910
That's cheating!

2637
01:54:59,350 --> 01:54:59,960
Okay...

2638
01:55:00,570 --> 01:55:01,490
Nice...

2639
01:55:02,690 --> 01:55:04,430
Get more level up...

2640
01:55:06,370 --> 01:55:07,210
Jesus...

2641
01:55:07,210 --> 01:55:07,910
Is there more of you?

2642
01:55:09,670 --> 01:55:10,510
Fuck!

2643
01:55:17,540 --> 01:55:18,380
Okay...

2644
01:55:21,570 --> 01:55:22,970
It's fine...

2645
01:55:24,210 --> 01:55:25,750
Just getting more level ups...

2646
01:55:26,690 --> 01:55:27,030
Nice!

2647
01:55:28,770 --> 01:55:29,610
Wait...

2648
01:55:29,610 --> 01:55:30,090
What's this?

2649
01:55:30,650 --> 01:55:31,330
Oh...

2650
01:55:31,330 --> 01:55:32,130
Fire arrows!

2651
01:55:33,850 --> 01:55:34,690
Alright...

2652
01:55:34,690 --> 01:55:35,790
We have to go like...

2653
01:55:37,110 --> 01:55:37,950
Outside...

2654
01:55:37,950 --> 01:55:39,090
I feel like...

2655
01:55:41,750 --> 01:55:42,270
Yeah...

2656
01:55:42,270 --> 01:55:43,830
Is that here or to the left?

2657
01:55:46,550 --> 01:55:48,610
I'm just gonna run past all of these...

2658
01:55:54,600 --> 01:55:55,120
Enhance...

2659
01:55:55,120 --> 01:55:57,400
I'll level up my spear first...

2660
01:55:57,400 --> 01:55:58,680
Before I level up anything else...

2661
01:56:01,260 --> 01:56:01,780
Save...

2662
01:56:05,610 --> 01:56:06,570
That's right...

2663
01:56:06,570 --> 01:56:09,790
Not even gonna let you TP yourself out of here...

2664
01:56:09,790 --> 01:56:10,570
That's right!

2665
01:56:11,790 --> 01:56:13,810
Think I'm gonna let you slowly TP up?

2666
01:56:13,810 --> 01:56:15,830
Ha ha ha ha ha...

2667
01:56:16,690 --> 01:56:17,410
That's right!

2668
01:56:18,250 --> 01:56:19,070
Ha ha ha ha...

2669
01:56:19,570 --> 01:56:20,550
I'm stupid!

2670
01:56:22,750 --> 01:56:25,210
I'm gonna let you just TP up...

2671
01:56:25,210 --> 01:56:25,810
Slowly...

2672
01:56:26,690 --> 01:56:27,990
Ha ha ha ha...

2673
01:56:28,650 --> 01:56:29,030
Yeah!

2674
01:56:29,530 --> 01:56:30,690
That's right!

2675
01:56:31,170 --> 01:56:32,470
Get out of here!

2676
01:56:34,370 --> 01:56:43,790
Ha ha ha...

2677
01:56:43,790 --> 01:56:44,830
If you don't...

2678
01:56:45,630 --> 01:56:46,150
Uh...

2679
01:56:46,730 --> 01:56:49,030
You can only load back to your save...

2680
01:56:49,030 --> 01:56:49,970
So I have to save...

2681
01:56:51,590 --> 01:56:52,630
Fuck it...

2682
01:56:52,630 --> 01:56:53,890
You got this...

2683
01:56:53,890 --> 01:56:54,810
Ha ha ha ha...

2684
01:56:56,730 --> 01:56:57,790
It's this area...

2685
01:57:01,930 --> 01:57:03,170
Wait, how do I...

2686
01:57:03,710 --> 01:57:04,990
How do I get to there?

2687
01:57:09,870 --> 01:57:11,530
I go from the side?

2688
01:57:11,790 --> 01:57:12,950
It might be the side...

2689
01:57:14,470 --> 01:57:14,990
Okay...

2690
01:57:16,090 --> 01:57:16,730
Here?

2691
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:25,440
What?

2692
01:57:25,680 --> 01:57:27,180
Okay, where is that area?

2693
01:57:28,060 --> 01:57:28,920
Did I see that?

2694
01:57:35,130 --> 01:57:36,710
Wait, where did my gun guy go?

2695
01:57:38,990 --> 01:57:40,210
Oh shit...

2696
01:57:40,210 --> 01:57:40,950
Oh shit...

2697
01:57:40,950 --> 01:57:41,590
Oh shit...

2698
01:57:41,590 --> 01:57:43,210
Oh shit...

2699
01:57:43,210 --> 01:57:45,770
I'm trying to figure it out...

2700
01:57:45,770 --> 01:57:47,170
Where to go...

2701
01:57:47,170 --> 01:57:47,790
Like here!

2702
01:57:48,090 --> 01:57:49,510
There's something...

2703
01:57:49,510 --> 01:57:50,730
That side...

2704
01:57:50,730 --> 01:57:51,410
I assume...

2705
01:57:54,390 --> 01:57:54,670
Alright...

2706
01:57:57,130 --> 01:57:58,250
Oh no...

2707
01:57:58,250 --> 01:58:00,170
I can run past all these guys, right?

2708
01:58:00,410 --> 01:58:00,690
No!

2709
01:58:01,590 --> 01:58:02,150
Wait...

2710
01:58:02,770 --> 01:58:03,330
Shit...

2711
01:58:03,330 --> 01:58:03,910
Okay...

2712
01:58:03,910 --> 01:58:04,790
Wait, where do I go?

2713
01:58:07,050 --> 01:58:08,170
I'm lost...

2714
01:58:11,830 --> 01:58:13,310
I'm actually a little lost...

2715
01:58:17,580 --> 01:58:18,180
They're not...

2716
01:58:18,180 --> 01:58:19,540
Okay, so there is...

2717
01:58:20,420 --> 01:58:21,520
Near far...

2718
01:58:21,520 --> 01:58:22,280
Unexplored...

2719
01:58:22,280 --> 01:58:24,000
There's a door in the small hallway?

2720
01:58:24,320 --> 01:58:24,820
Which one?

2721
01:58:30,110 --> 01:58:30,630
Okay...

2722
01:58:30,630 --> 01:58:31,850
Because we can't go through this door...

2723
01:58:32,470 --> 01:58:33,050
Goodbye guys...

2724
01:58:35,610 --> 01:58:36,650
And then...

2725
01:58:38,290 --> 01:58:39,830
There's nothing over here...

2726
01:58:42,490 --> 01:58:45,050
This is the only issue with fixed cameras...

2727
01:58:45,050 --> 01:58:45,830
It's so hard...

2728
01:58:47,690 --> 01:58:49,970
It's so hard to figure out where things are...

2729
01:58:55,930 --> 01:58:56,450
Okay...

2730
01:58:56,450 --> 01:58:57,450
Here...

2731
01:58:58,930 --> 01:59:00,470
Is there an extra door I did...

2732
01:59:00,470 --> 01:59:00,810
Oh...

2733
01:59:01,430 --> 01:59:01,870
Here...

2734
01:59:02,850 --> 01:59:04,470
I didn't see this door...

2735
01:59:10,810 --> 01:59:11,250
Ghost...

2736
01:59:11,250 --> 01:59:12,810
You can see me, can't you?

2737
01:59:13,190 --> 01:59:15,710
You must have a grudge against Nobunaga...

2738
01:59:15,710 --> 01:59:16,470
As I do...

2739
01:59:17,410 --> 01:59:19,610
I was sent to Gifu Castle as a scout...

2740
01:59:19,610 --> 01:59:21,330
And was caught and killed here...

2741
01:59:21,330 --> 01:59:22,010
And now...

2742
01:59:22,010 --> 01:59:24,390
I've been caught by the evil energy...

2743
01:59:24,390 --> 01:59:26,250
Haunting this well...

2744
01:59:26,250 --> 01:59:28,090
I'd like to give you something...

2745
01:59:28,090 --> 01:59:29,540
But I can't even do that now...

2746
01:59:30,330 --> 01:59:30,790
However...

2747
01:59:30,790 --> 01:59:33,730
If you can obtain the purified charm from the castle...

2748
01:59:33,730 --> 01:59:35,330
Then maybe we can help each other...

2749
01:59:37,150 --> 01:59:37,610
Okay...

2750
01:59:37,610 --> 01:59:38,730
Where the fuck is that?

2751
01:59:40,810 --> 01:59:42,730
The birth of the demon clan...

2752
01:59:42,730 --> 01:59:43,830
Began many years ago...

2753
01:59:44,630 --> 01:59:45,810
It's said that the king of the demons...

2754
01:59:46,390 --> 01:59:47,950
Was born in the chaos of the universe...

2755
01:59:48,590 --> 01:59:50,870
And that he created Earth in 13 days...

2756
01:59:50,870 --> 01:59:52,730
Before spawning the demon clan underground...

2757
01:59:54,370 --> 01:59:54,850
Then...

2758
01:59:54,850 --> 01:59:56,930
Ford and Brahe has planted the seeds of life...

2759
01:59:56,930 --> 01:59:58,330
And all across the globe...

2760
01:59:58,330 --> 02:00:00,230
And created the animals known as...

2761
02:00:00,230 --> 02:00:00,910
Humans...

2762
02:00:00,910 --> 02:00:02,850
As the perfect food for demons...

2763
02:00:03,950 --> 02:00:05,070
Humans refer...

2764
02:00:05,070 --> 02:00:06,970
To demons as devils or monsters...

2765
02:00:07,610 --> 02:00:10,010
Yet very few are aware of what demons truly are...

2766
02:00:10,730 --> 02:00:13,270
The demons and humans came to an agreement...

2767
02:00:13,270 --> 02:00:16,010
Where the demons provided science and technology to humans...

2768
02:00:16,010 --> 02:00:16,910
And in return...

2769
02:00:16,910 --> 02:00:20,210
The humans provided many sacrifices to the demons...

2770
02:00:20,210 --> 02:00:21,030
Because however...

2771
02:00:21,030 --> 02:00:21,650
Wait, what?

2772
02:00:21,930 --> 02:00:23,950
That's not a bad deal...

2773
02:00:23,950 --> 02:00:25,510
There's too many...

2774
02:00:25,510 --> 02:00:26,250
I mean...

2775
02:00:26,250 --> 02:00:28,190
People are already dying anyway...

2776
02:00:28,190 --> 02:00:28,510
What?

2777
02:00:29,510 --> 02:00:30,030
Like...

2778
02:00:30,030 --> 02:00:31,310
Science and technology?

2779
02:00:31,770 --> 02:00:33,030
I mean...

2780
02:00:33,030 --> 02:00:34,710
We could go to space!

2781
02:00:36,790 --> 02:00:37,750
There's however...

2782
02:00:37,750 --> 02:00:39,390
A clan of Oni in a country called...

2783
02:00:39,750 --> 02:00:40,990
Zipengu in the far east...

2784
02:00:40,990 --> 02:00:43,070
Which had lived there since before the humans were born...

2785
02:00:44,050 --> 02:00:45,090
This clan...

2786
02:00:45,090 --> 02:00:46,170
If you feel so bad...

2787
02:00:46,170 --> 02:00:46,530
The demons...

2788
02:00:46,530 --> 02:00:48,150
Oh, it took one guy...

2789
02:00:48,150 --> 02:00:51,110
It literally took one guy to fuck it all up for us...

2790
02:00:51,110 --> 02:00:51,670
Like...

2791
02:00:51,670 --> 02:00:52,810
I'm sorry...

2792
02:00:52,810 --> 02:00:54,210
Just feed them the elderly!

2793
02:00:54,890 --> 02:00:55,590
It's just...

2794
02:00:55,590 --> 02:00:55,910
Like...

2795
02:00:55,910 --> 02:00:56,570
They're...

2796
02:00:56,570 --> 02:00:57,810
Or like the sick!

2797
02:00:58,090 --> 02:00:59,970
They're about to die anyway...

2798
02:00:59,970 --> 02:01:01,750
We get science and...

2799
02:01:01,750 --> 02:01:02,350
Look, I'm...

2800
02:01:02,350 --> 02:01:04,970
We get science and technology!

2801
02:01:05,610 --> 02:01:06,390
We literally...

2802
02:01:06,390 --> 02:01:08,310
It took one guy to fuck this up...

2803
02:01:08,310 --> 02:01:09,150
Fuck this really good...

2804
02:01:09,150 --> 02:01:10,630
That was a good deal, chat!

2805
02:01:11,010 --> 02:01:12,310
That was a really good deal!

2806
02:01:12,310 --> 02:01:13,250
In your...

2807
02:01:13,250 --> 02:01:15,470
In your annihilation of the Oni clan...

2808
02:01:15,470 --> 02:01:16,550
It said their few only...

2809
02:01:16,550 --> 02:01:18,190
Their only weapons will still remain...

2810
02:01:18,190 --> 02:01:19,290
Hidden in the dragons...

2811
02:01:19,290 --> 02:01:20,010
As in Bak...

2812
02:01:20,570 --> 02:01:21,030
Zipengu...

2813
02:01:21,030 --> 02:01:22,310
But no one knows where exactly...

2814
02:01:26,980 --> 02:01:27,920
Look, not me!

2815
02:01:28,040 --> 02:01:28,860
I'm very healthy!

2816
02:01:32,140 --> 02:01:33,180
Not me though!

2817
02:01:36,440 --> 02:01:37,480
I don't understand!

2818
02:01:37,940 --> 02:01:39,120
I'm missing a weapon!

2819
02:01:39,820 --> 02:01:41,240
Wait guys, where do I go?

2820
02:01:41,840 --> 02:01:43,460
I'm a little lost here...

2821
02:01:43,460 --> 02:01:44,240
For this one...

2822
02:01:54,010 --> 02:01:55,530
Like, I'm missing like...

2823
02:01:55,530 --> 02:01:56,750
A weapon...

2824
02:01:57,310 --> 02:01:57,830
Apparently...

2825
02:01:59,330 --> 02:02:01,490
Oh, did I actually have a purify charm?

2826
02:02:01,750 --> 02:02:02,270
Oh!

2827
02:02:03,090 --> 02:02:04,710
I forgot this game...

2828
02:02:04,710 --> 02:02:05,010
Like...

2829
02:02:05,010 --> 02:02:06,970
It doesn't automatically give it to you...

2830
02:02:06,970 --> 02:02:07,950
If you have it...

2831
02:02:07,950 --> 02:02:08,810
You have to like...

2832
02:02:08,810 --> 02:02:09,430
Actually...

2833
02:02:09,430 --> 02:02:10,530
Hand it over to him...

2834
02:02:10,990 --> 02:02:12,310
I forgot about that...

2835
02:02:12,310 --> 02:02:15,130
That was my bad...

2836
02:02:16,370 --> 02:02:16,890
Yeah...

2837
02:02:16,890 --> 02:02:18,610
I did find one...

2838
02:02:24,600 --> 02:02:25,660
Thank you...

2839
02:02:25,660 --> 02:02:28,020
Now I'm free from the evil energy...

2840
02:02:28,020 --> 02:02:30,140
And I can rest in peace...

2841
02:02:30,140 --> 02:02:30,520
Goodbye!

2842
02:02:32,540 --> 02:02:33,080
Goodbye!

2843
02:02:35,360 --> 02:02:36,400
Now go...

2844
02:02:36,400 --> 02:02:37,100
And defeat...

2845
02:02:37,760 --> 02:02:38,300
Nobunaga!

2846
02:02:40,140 --> 02:02:40,680
Yay!

2847
02:02:40,760 --> 02:02:41,580
He's free now!

2848
02:02:42,060 --> 02:02:43,180
What did I get from that?

2849
02:02:45,480 --> 02:02:46,020
Oh!

2850
02:02:46,240 --> 02:02:46,640
Nice!

2851
02:02:47,640 --> 02:02:48,180
Alright...

2852
02:02:48,180 --> 02:02:49,280
Before we do...

2853
02:02:49,280 --> 02:02:50,340
I'm gonna use the bathroom...

2854
02:02:50,340 --> 02:02:51,480
I've been hydrating a lot...

2855
02:02:51,480 --> 02:02:52,220
I'll be right back guys!

2856
02:05:38,200 --> 02:05:38,940
I'm back!

2857
02:05:39,320 --> 02:05:39,980
I'm back!

2858
02:05:40,200 --> 02:05:40,580
I'm back!

2859
02:05:40,580 --> 02:05:42,200
I had a little snack too...

2860
02:05:42,200 --> 02:05:44,160
I get myself a little snack...

2861
02:05:44,160 --> 02:05:46,140
You guys like spending time with a dead corpse?

2862
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:47,740
You have fun?

2863
02:05:47,740 --> 02:05:50,000
Ha ha ha ha ha ha...

2864
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:50,740
With a...

2865
02:05:51,440 --> 02:05:52,900
With a dead body...

2866
02:05:52,900 --> 02:05:53,740
While that was gone?

2867
02:05:56,560 --> 02:05:56,980
Alright...

2868
02:05:58,320 --> 02:05:58,740
Alright...

2869
02:05:58,740 --> 02:05:59,340
Ha ha ha...

2870
02:06:00,500 --> 02:06:00,920
Nope...

2871
02:06:01,400 --> 02:06:01,820
Uh...

2872
02:06:01,820 --> 02:06:02,960
Morbid Boss Pyre!

2873
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:03,380
Hey guys!

2874
02:06:03,460 --> 02:06:04,140
Thank you for the super chat!

2875
02:06:04,240 --> 02:06:04,440
Thank you!

2876
02:06:04,440 --> 02:06:05,020
Thank you!

2877
02:06:05,140 --> 02:06:06,420
Thank you for the super chat!

2878
02:06:06,560 --> 02:06:06,760
Thank you!

2879
02:06:06,860 --> 02:06:07,280
Thank you!

2880
02:06:07,540 --> 02:06:08,140
Hey Toki!

2881
02:06:08,280 --> 02:06:09,580
I hope you're having the best stream!

2882
02:06:09,960 --> 02:06:11,480
I have some birthday obligation to go now...

2883
02:06:11,480 --> 02:06:13,340
So I hope you and chat have a great weekend ahead!

2884
02:06:13,460 --> 02:06:13,900
Thank you!

2885
02:06:13,960 --> 02:06:14,800
Thank you for the super chat!

2886
02:06:14,920 --> 02:06:15,140
Thank you!

2887
02:06:15,140 --> 02:06:15,800
Thank you!

2888
02:06:16,080 --> 02:06:19,280
I hope you have a good time at the birthday party...

2889
02:06:19,280 --> 02:06:20,380
It's this way...

2890
02:06:25,610 --> 02:06:26,130
Okay...

2891
02:06:26,130 --> 02:06:28,930
Let me save my game real quick...

2892
02:06:33,760 --> 02:06:34,280
Okay...

2893
02:06:34,280 --> 02:06:35,180
Alright...

2894
02:06:35,180 --> 02:06:36,180
Give me a sec...

2895
02:06:36,180 --> 02:06:37,600
Two bros...

2896
02:06:37,600 --> 02:06:38,820
The moment I put this on...

2897
02:06:38,820 --> 02:06:39,460
I'll fight you!

2898
02:06:42,660 --> 02:06:43,940
Thank you for waiting!

2899
02:06:46,400 --> 02:06:48,640
The door's been unlocked...

2900
02:06:48,640 --> 02:06:48,960
JK!

2901
02:06:49,360 --> 02:06:51,760
Ha ha ha ha ha...

2902
02:06:51,760 --> 02:06:52,400
JK!

2903
02:06:53,020 --> 02:06:55,060
I wasn't gonna fight you...

2904
02:06:55,060 --> 02:06:56,400
Cause I'm a pussy!

2905
02:07:00,100 --> 02:07:01,520
Oh, it's this guy...

2906
02:07:02,460 --> 02:07:03,220
I hated that guy...

2907
02:07:03,220 --> 02:07:04,100
I hate that guy...

2908
02:07:15,140 --> 02:07:15,680
Sorry...

2909
02:07:15,680 --> 02:07:17,560
You're very clever to stay here with me...

2910
02:07:17,560 --> 02:07:19,360
Instead of returning to his side...

2911
02:07:19,360 --> 02:07:20,180
Which is falling!

2912
02:07:21,680 --> 02:07:22,220
Uuugh!

2913
02:07:22,480 --> 02:07:22,680
I hate that guy!

2914
02:07:22,680 --> 02:07:23,180
Oh my god...

2915
02:07:23,180 --> 02:07:23,500
He's a creep!

2916
02:07:26,180 --> 02:07:26,720
Uuuh...

2917
02:07:26,720 --> 02:07:27,440
Uig...

2918
02:07:27,440 --> 02:07:27,460
Uuuh...

2919
02:07:27,460 --> 02:07:27,800
Uuuh...

2920
02:07:27,800 --> 02:07:28,000
Uuuh...

2921
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:28,080
Uuuh...

2922
02:07:28,080 --> 02:07:28,540
Bro...

2923
02:07:28,540 --> 02:07:28,600
Uuh..

2924
02:07:28,600 --> 02:07:29,920
So serious...

2925
02:07:29,920 --> 02:07:31,300
You're feisty...

2926
02:07:31,300 --> 02:07:32,740
As always...

2927
02:07:32,740 --> 02:07:33,700
Anyway...

2928
02:07:33,700 --> 02:07:37,480
This is the will of our lord, so I cannot allow you to leave this castle.

2929
02:07:44,880 --> 02:07:45,880
Or help out.

2930
02:07:48,020 --> 02:07:49,080
Yeah, it's me.

2931
02:07:49,740 --> 02:07:50,480
Wait, what?

2932
02:07:54,580 --> 02:07:56,820
He attacked the village just to kill me.

2933
02:08:07,360 --> 02:08:10,520
Damn, we're not much of a threat if we stood in your way.

2934
02:08:13,480 --> 02:08:15,080
Like, I don't understand...

2935
02:08:15,080 --> 02:08:16,680
That wasn't much of a threat then.

2936
02:08:16,880 --> 02:08:18,940
If it took that fast to kill us off.

2937
02:08:20,980 --> 02:08:22,280
Wait, no, come back!

2938
02:08:22,520 --> 02:08:23,000
Wait, no!

2939
02:08:23,240 --> 02:08:23,740
Wait!

2940
02:08:24,280 --> 02:08:25,720
Two hands is better than...

2941
02:08:25,720 --> 02:08:26,300
What?

2942
02:08:28,220 --> 02:08:28,720
Wait!

2943
02:08:30,540 --> 02:08:31,040
Why?

2944
02:08:31,480 --> 02:08:33,620
Why did I tell her to leave?

2945
02:08:35,640 --> 02:08:35,860
I...

2946
02:08:37,780 --> 02:08:39,280
I don't understand!

2947
02:08:40,480 --> 02:08:42,060
Why did I tell her to leave?

2948
02:08:43,140 --> 02:08:45,360
Two hands is better than one!

2949
02:08:46,840 --> 02:08:48,020
Excuse me?

2950
02:08:53,500 --> 02:08:55,060
Where did she go?

2951
02:08:55,640 --> 02:08:57,080
She just left...

2952
02:08:57,080 --> 02:08:58,440
She just left like that?

2953
02:08:59,300 --> 02:08:59,980
That's fucked.

2954
02:09:07,520 --> 02:09:09,680
Oh, that's a new sword!

2955
02:09:09,680 --> 02:09:11,440
Oh, that's not my new sword!

2956
02:09:11,860 --> 02:09:12,560
Never mind!

2957
02:09:13,140 --> 02:09:13,580
Ha ha ha ha!

2958
02:09:16,400 --> 02:09:17,440
Or stay!

2959
02:09:21,500 --> 02:09:22,520
Who are you?

2960
02:09:23,420 --> 02:09:25,620
Oh, I'm glad you asked!

2961
02:09:26,220 --> 02:09:28,520
My name is...

2962
02:09:28,520 --> 02:09:29,580
Who are you?

2963
02:09:29,740 --> 02:09:30,380
Jurgen Dantus!

2964
02:09:31,140 --> 02:09:34,020
The greatest swordsman of all demons!

2965
02:09:34,240 --> 02:09:35,480
This hair is like a mushroom!

2966
02:09:36,240 --> 02:09:37,880
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

2967
02:09:38,440 --> 02:09:39,720
Bro, you can't say that, Jube!

2968
02:09:39,920 --> 02:09:40,940
You can't say that!

2969
02:09:41,960 --> 02:09:43,560
He's just a little...

2970
02:09:43,560 --> 02:09:44,980
Like some buoyant, man!

2971
02:09:45,780 --> 02:09:51,420
My sword is trembling with tears of excitement!

2972
02:09:54,900 --> 02:09:57,200
Why you got nipples on his armor?

2973
02:09:58,160 --> 02:10:02,220
Why does Superman wear his underwear outside his superhero suit?

2974
02:10:06,230 --> 02:10:09,830
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew!

2975
02:10:10,370 --> 02:10:12,090
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew!

2976
02:10:12,950 --> 02:10:14,070
Does he deflect everything?

2977
02:10:16,350 --> 02:10:16,710
But...

2978
02:10:17,250 --> 02:10:17,610
Wait!

2979
02:10:18,570 --> 02:10:19,230
He does!

2980
02:10:20,850 --> 02:10:23,470
Wait, how do I kill him if he just deflects everything?

2981
02:10:29,630 --> 02:10:30,370
Oh my god!

2982
02:10:30,450 --> 02:10:31,130
Oh my god!

2983
02:10:31,250 --> 02:10:31,570
What do I

2984
02:10:36,880 --> 02:10:37,220
do?!

2985
02:10:37,220 --> 02:10:39,040
Use what?!

2986
02:10:40,220 --> 02:10:40,960
Come on!

2987
02:10:41,520 --> 02:10:42,400
Oh my god!

2988
02:10:42,520 --> 02:10:42,840
Goodbye!

2989
02:10:46,340 --> 02:10:47,140
It is...

2990
02:10:47,140 --> 02:10:48,020
Yeah, it was scripted.

2991
02:10:48,060 --> 02:10:49,080
I was like, what the fuck?!

2992
02:10:49,080 --> 02:10:50,180
That was an entire...

2993
02:10:50,180 --> 02:10:52,620
That was an entire...

2994
02:10:52,620 --> 02:10:55,640
You are too weak to take me on.

2995
02:10:58,140 --> 02:10:58,820
Oh my god!

2996
02:10:58,940 --> 02:10:59,440
He called me weak!

2997
02:10:59,540 --> 02:11:00,060
Let me at him!

2998
02:11:00,220 --> 02:11:01,180
Hold me back, though!

2999
02:11:01,340 --> 02:11:02,000
Let me at him!

3000
02:11:02,140 --> 02:11:02,940
Hold me back!

3001
02:11:06,540 --> 02:11:07,860
Hunter, thank you for the raid!

3002
02:11:08,060 --> 02:11:09,000
Thank you!

3003
02:11:11,080 --> 02:11:12,420
Time for a rocket launcher!

3004
02:11:12,700 --> 02:11:13,320
You know, if...

3005
02:11:13,320 --> 02:11:18,540
You know, if that one clan didn't fuck it up for all of us, maybe we would have a rocket launcher by then!

3006
02:11:22,160 --> 02:11:22,800
What's that?

3007
02:11:27,420 --> 02:11:27,780
Oh!

3008
02:11:31,950 --> 02:11:32,510
Oh!

3009
02:11:32,630 --> 02:11:33,550
We gotta put the...

3010
02:11:33,550 --> 02:11:34,030
The...

3011
02:11:34,030 --> 02:11:34,650
Oh!

3012
02:11:34,930 --> 02:11:35,610
Gotta put the...

3013
02:11:35,610 --> 02:11:36,330
Jewel in there.

3014
02:11:37,470 --> 02:11:38,310
Okay.

3015
02:11:54,820 --> 02:11:56,220
The faith orb.

3016
02:11:58,860 --> 02:11:59,700
Yeah.

3017
02:12:05,900 --> 02:12:06,320
Oh!

3018
02:12:13,700 --> 02:12:14,940
What's in it?

3019
02:12:17,540 --> 02:12:20,320
What do I see with my special eyes?

3020
02:12:21,980 --> 02:12:23,980
What the fuck?!

3021
02:12:25,460 --> 02:12:27,120
What year is this?

3022
02:12:28,360 --> 02:12:29,120
What?

3023
02:12:29,120 --> 02:12:29,200
What?

3024
02:12:31,240 --> 02:12:32,400
That's a...

3025
02:12:32,860 --> 02:12:34,320
That's a mechanical horse.

3026
02:12:34,800 --> 02:12:37,160
Are real horses just not good enough for me?

3027
02:12:37,460 --> 02:12:39,800
Like, it's not even a magic horse.

3028
02:12:40,020 --> 02:12:42,000
It's a robot horse.

3029
02:12:42,640 --> 02:12:43,300
I...

3030
02:12:43,720 --> 02:12:45,300
I don't remember this.

3031
02:12:51,600 --> 02:12:55,080
Not even a fucking magical horse.

3032
02:12:55,260 --> 02:12:57,140
It's literally a robot horse.

3033
02:13:01,740 --> 02:13:02,540
Get on.

3034
02:13:02,540 --> 02:13:05,200
I don't remember this at all.

3035
02:13:11,500 --> 02:13:14,440
Get on this weird metal horse, son.

3036
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:19,560
I can't pet cats, but I can pet my magical...

3037
02:13:19,560 --> 02:13:20,000
My...

3038
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:20,180
Sorry.

3039
02:13:20,300 --> 02:13:21,480
My robot horse.

3040
02:13:43,420 --> 02:13:44,280
Oh, she's...

3041
02:13:44,280 --> 02:13:45,260
Oh, she's so shy.

3042
02:13:45,260 --> 02:13:45,880
I...

3043
02:13:45,880 --> 02:13:47,760
She's like...

3044
02:13:47,760 --> 02:13:48,240
Yeah?

3045
02:13:50,220 --> 02:13:52,580
Me and the samurai on...

3046
02:13:52,580 --> 02:13:52,800
What?

3047
02:13:54,420 --> 02:13:56,220
Where is he gonna go?

3048
02:13:56,620 --> 02:13:58,360
He's a fucking robot.

3049
02:13:59,160 --> 02:14:02,300
Like, just park him next to my fucking inn.

3050
02:14:02,760 --> 02:14:04,300
Where is he gonna go?

3051
02:14:04,700 --> 02:14:06,000
He doesn't even need to eat.

3052
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:07,900
He's just...

3053
02:14:07,900 --> 02:14:09,580
I never did.

3054
02:14:09,760 --> 02:14:10,260
Get your name.

3055
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:12,620
What?

3056
02:14:15,060 --> 02:14:17,340
He's eating robot horse.

3057
02:14:19,860 --> 02:14:21,920
Don't we gonna think this weird?

3058
02:14:22,200 --> 02:14:25,120
I have a fucking robot horse in the horse stable?

3059
02:14:26,960 --> 02:14:29,200
We had no chance against his army.

3060
02:14:29,460 --> 02:14:32,500
So I went to Gifu castle to kill Nobunaga myself.

3061
02:14:35,940 --> 02:14:37,100
I was caught.

3062
02:14:38,220 --> 02:14:39,260
I understand.

3063
02:14:39,720 --> 02:14:41,500
You won't steal...

3064
02:14:41,500 --> 02:14:43,340
You won't download a horse, would ya?

3065
02:14:47,420 --> 02:14:49,480
I'll be here in Amashu for a while.

3066
02:14:49,480 --> 02:14:49,760
Whoa!

3067
02:14:51,780 --> 02:14:53,160
Oh, this is fast.

3068
02:14:56,020 --> 02:14:57,320
Yes, we would.

3069
02:14:58,340 --> 02:14:58,980
Anyway...

3070
02:14:59,400 --> 02:15:00,580
Thank you for helping me.

3071
02:15:04,840 --> 02:15:07,080
If you need anything...

3072
02:15:07,080 --> 02:15:08,260
Please...

3073
02:15:08,260 --> 02:15:09,600
Let me know.

3074
02:15:11,060 --> 02:15:12,740
Yeah, I mean, thank you for the super chat.

3075
02:15:12,940 --> 02:15:13,120
Thank you.

3076
02:15:13,260 --> 02:15:13,700
Thank you.

3077
02:15:14,060 --> 02:15:16,720
Horse-shaped Audrey goes into the horse-shaped hole.

3078
02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:22,480
I think the other horse is like, Bro, what the fuck?

3079
02:15:25,420 --> 02:15:26,440
I used to get...

3080
02:15:26,980 --> 02:15:28,440
Bro, this is so funny.

3081
02:15:29,100 --> 02:15:32,240
He's just like, Bro, what the fuck is that next to me?

3082
02:15:36,660 --> 02:15:38,360
He's just standing there.

3083
02:15:38,520 --> 02:15:39,480
He's not even moving.

3084
02:15:39,480 --> 02:15:40,360
There's no animation.

3085
02:15:41,300 --> 02:15:43,160
Because it's like, you know, fucking meta.

3086
02:15:44,420 --> 02:15:45,420
Hey, that's me.

3087
02:15:45,420 --> 02:15:45,640
Huh?

3088
02:15:54,750 --> 02:15:55,230
Who are you?

3089
02:15:56,150 --> 02:15:57,030
Kotaro Fuma.

3090
02:15:57,350 --> 02:16:00,230
A young chief of the ninja group that the Hojo clan retains.

3091
02:16:00,430 --> 02:16:01,290
What do you want?

3092
02:16:01,510 --> 02:16:02,310
Oh my gosh.

3093
02:16:02,490 --> 02:16:03,610
I'm like an encyclopedia.

3094
02:16:04,550 --> 02:16:05,830
Let me give you some advice.

3095
02:16:06,430 --> 02:16:07,750
Watch out for that woman Oyu.

3096
02:16:08,550 --> 02:16:09,710
She's hiding something.

3097
02:16:09,870 --> 02:16:10,630
I can feel it.

3098
02:16:10,950 --> 02:16:12,210
I'll find out what it is.

3099
02:16:12,870 --> 02:16:13,490
Bro, what?

3100
02:16:13,530 --> 02:16:14,210
We just met.

3101
02:16:14,670 --> 02:16:16,090
He's like, don't trust women.

3102
02:16:16,810 --> 02:16:18,190
I'm like, bro, are you okay?

3103
02:16:18,530 --> 02:16:19,450
Who hurt you?

3104
02:16:20,350 --> 02:16:21,430
Like, the inst...

3105
02:16:21,430 --> 02:16:23,650
Like, he's just instantly like, don't trust her.

3106
02:16:29,230 --> 02:16:30,430
Alright, I'll go back.

3107
02:16:31,050 --> 02:16:31,710
Wait, is he okay?

3108
02:16:39,270 --> 02:16:40,410
Wait, is...

3109
02:16:40,410 --> 02:16:41,050
Is he okay?

3110
02:16:41,410 --> 02:16:42,770
You think I'm drunk?

3111
02:16:46,480 --> 02:16:48,360
Wait, I have more books for you.

3112
02:16:49,020 --> 02:16:49,980
Don't worry.

3113
02:16:51,160 --> 02:16:52,640
I got another book.

3114
02:16:57,920 --> 02:17:00,560
It would be better to read them all at once.

3115
02:17:05,800 --> 02:17:06,360
Yeah!

3116
02:17:06,840 --> 02:17:07,740
Normal bullet.

3117
02:17:07,900 --> 02:17:08,900
I don't have a gun yet.

3118
02:17:12,140 --> 02:17:12,700
Oh!

3119
02:17:13,180 --> 02:17:14,140
He likes me now!

3120
02:17:14,800 --> 02:17:15,580
Wait, what?

3121
02:17:18,480 --> 02:17:19,040
Oh!

3122
02:17:19,900 --> 02:17:20,060
Wait.

3123
02:17:24,860 --> 02:17:25,420
What?

3124
02:17:29,120 --> 02:17:29,740
Wait.

3125
02:17:30,060 --> 02:17:30,760
Two women?

3126
02:17:31,720 --> 02:17:32,940
Wait, what?

3127
02:17:33,400 --> 02:17:34,260
Did you send...

3128
02:17:34,260 --> 02:17:35,460
Did you buy me a...

3129
02:17:35,460 --> 02:17:36,640
Did you like...

3130
02:17:36,640 --> 02:17:38,580
Buy me time with women?

3131
02:17:40,800 --> 02:17:41,860
Where's the second woman?

3132
02:17:43,920 --> 02:17:46,160
Who are these people in my...

3133
02:17:46,160 --> 02:17:46,900
Wait.

3134
02:17:47,900 --> 02:17:48,240
Oh!

3135
02:17:49,260 --> 02:17:50,280
Okay, there's her.

3136
02:17:50,660 --> 02:17:51,840
Where's the other one?

3137
02:17:55,960 --> 02:17:56,800
Where's the...

3138
02:17:56,800 --> 02:17:58,020
There's a second woman?

3139
02:18:00,460 --> 02:18:01,620
Oh wait, I should buy...

3140
02:18:01,620 --> 02:18:02,040
You should write.

3141
02:18:02,140 --> 02:18:03,160
I should buy more gifts.

3142
02:18:03,700 --> 02:18:04,120
You're right.

3143
02:18:06,680 --> 02:18:07,120
Oh!

3144
02:18:07,320 --> 02:18:08,400
I get a special discount!

3145
02:18:10,200 --> 02:18:11,400
What do I want to buy?

3146
02:18:11,600 --> 02:18:12,460
Oh, vodka.

3147
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:14,120
Okay, let's buy vodka.

3148
02:18:14,460 --> 02:18:15,760
Since we have extra anyway.

3149
02:18:18,060 --> 02:18:18,940
And then...

3150
02:18:18,940 --> 02:18:19,820
Oh!

3151
02:18:23,710 --> 02:18:24,150
Yes!

3152
02:18:26,370 --> 02:18:27,530
Let's get a love potion.

3153
02:18:28,530 --> 02:18:29,850
And then...

3154
02:18:29,850 --> 02:18:30,470
Oh, we should...

3155
02:18:30,470 --> 02:18:34,980
A novel depicting indecent relationship between...

3156
02:18:35,290 --> 02:18:37,170
It does not leave but...

3157
02:18:37,170 --> 02:18:37,450
Yes!

3158
02:18:39,510 --> 02:18:41,010
Let's get that.

3159
02:18:41,430 --> 02:18:42,130
Let's get...

3160
02:18:45,420 --> 02:18:46,430
Oh my god!

3161
02:18:50,120 --> 02:18:50,950
I'm ready.

3162
02:18:52,210 --> 02:18:53,610
I'm ready.

3163
02:18:53,610 --> 02:18:54,550
Wait.

3164
02:18:55,230 --> 02:18:56,330
Does it work on...

3165
02:18:56,330 --> 02:18:59,090
Does it work on the guys or only...

3166
02:19:02,690 --> 02:19:04,370
Or only the women?

3167
02:19:05,930 --> 02:19:06,470
Where's the...

3168
02:19:06,470 --> 02:19:06,830
Is it her?

3169
02:19:08,570 --> 02:19:10,170
Look at me!

3170
02:19:16,710 --> 02:19:17,770
I picked wrong.

3171
02:19:18,410 --> 02:19:19,230
Guys, I picked wrong.

3172
02:19:19,730 --> 02:19:19,990
Guys.

3173
02:19:20,190 --> 02:19:21,070
Guys, I picked wrong.

3174
02:19:21,070 --> 02:19:21,590
I...

3175
02:19:22,150 --> 02:19:22,630
I...

3176
02:19:29,210 --> 02:19:29,690
Oh.

3177
02:19:30,170 --> 02:19:30,910
Oh, it's not.

3178
02:19:30,990 --> 02:19:31,450
I don't know.

3179
02:19:31,630 --> 02:19:32,390
I got too greedy.

3180
02:19:32,710 --> 02:19:34,110
I got too greedy, guys.

3181
02:19:34,630 --> 02:19:35,110
I...

3182
02:19:36,030 --> 02:19:42,510
You and that hateful woman, Takajo, must die.

3183
02:19:44,090 --> 02:19:44,570
Oh!

3184
02:19:48,180 --> 02:19:49,540
Guys, I got too greedy.

3185
02:19:50,360 --> 02:19:52,200
She said two different women.

3186
02:19:52,380 --> 02:19:55,400
I was like, oh, I want to know what this new woman looks like.

3187
02:20:02,400 --> 02:20:04,040
I got played.

3188
02:20:10,760 --> 02:20:12,020
Wait, what?

3189
02:20:13,220 --> 02:20:14,060
No.

3190
02:20:15,600 --> 02:20:16,780
Wait, what?

3191
02:20:17,380 --> 02:20:17,940
No!

3192
02:20:18,980 --> 02:20:19,660
No!

3193
02:20:19,940 --> 02:20:20,880
I was about to go!

3194
02:20:26,930 --> 02:20:27,360
No!

3195
02:20:27,540 --> 02:20:29,140
I can't even go back!

3196
02:20:29,900 --> 02:20:31,320
I just...

3197
02:20:31,320 --> 02:20:31,780
No!

3198
02:20:32,380 --> 02:20:33,340
It's too late.

3199
02:20:34,560 --> 02:20:35,400
Oh, no.

3200
02:20:36,850 --> 02:20:37,280
No!

3201
02:20:43,060 --> 02:20:44,120
No!

3202
02:20:44,740 --> 02:20:46,740
I got too greedy!

3203
02:20:51,420 --> 02:20:52,220
No!

3204
02:20:52,460 --> 02:20:52,620
I got too greedy!

3205
02:20:52,620 --> 02:20:54,000
Now I have no women!

3206
02:21:03,240 --> 02:21:04,480
I don't know.

3207
02:21:04,960 --> 02:21:06,440
I don't know.

3208
02:21:08,660 --> 02:21:09,190
I...

3209
02:21:09,720 --> 02:21:11,880
I'm so sad!

3210
02:21:14,970 --> 02:21:17,280
I can't believe it!

3211
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,860
When they said you can only pick one!

3212
02:21:21,120 --> 02:21:23,000
I thought he was joking!

3213
02:21:24,320 --> 02:21:26,340
I was like, teehee!

3214
02:21:31,280 --> 02:21:32,860
I was greedy!

3215
02:21:35,120 --> 02:21:36,140
I was greedy!

3216
02:21:36,140 --> 02:21:37,280
I was so greedy!

3217
02:21:43,830 --> 02:21:47,470
This is the greed they talk about in the Bible!

3218
02:21:47,830 --> 02:21:48,530
This is it!

3219
02:21:49,430 --> 02:21:50,990
They talk about me!

3220
02:21:53,910 --> 02:21:55,110
No, it's too late.

3221
02:21:55,210 --> 02:21:55,890
I already saved.

3222
02:21:56,470 --> 02:21:59,530
I live with my consequences and my choices.

3223
02:22:01,030 --> 02:22:03,250
You gotta live with your choices!

3224
02:22:04,130 --> 02:22:05,250
You gotta...

3225
02:22:05,250 --> 02:22:08,510
You gotta know your actions have consequences!

3226
02:22:08,970 --> 02:22:09,650
Don't be greedy!

3227
02:22:09,970 --> 02:22:11,350
Don't be greedy like me!

3228
02:22:11,810 --> 02:22:13,590
You should've went with like...

3229
02:22:13,590 --> 02:22:15,550
I should've went with the one that I knew...

3230
02:22:16,170 --> 02:22:17,770
The one that I knew...

3231
02:22:18,270 --> 02:22:20,690
She was so good to me and then I...

3232
02:22:20,690 --> 02:22:22,650
I squandered it!

3233
02:22:23,790 --> 02:22:25,390
Wait, how do I get to this chest?

3234
02:22:27,270 --> 02:22:29,730
There's no save points in life, guys!

3235
02:22:30,310 --> 02:22:33,190
You gotta live with the choices you make!

3236
02:22:35,950 --> 02:22:39,030
And I made a really bad choice!

3237
02:22:39,770 --> 02:22:40,210
I...

3238
02:22:43,910 --> 02:22:44,950
I ha...

3239
02:22:44,950 --> 02:22:46,850
I like how...

3240
02:22:47,510 --> 02:22:48,210
Oh, rats!

3241
02:22:48,210 --> 02:22:50,210
I like how, um...

3242
02:22:51,370 --> 02:22:54,930
One of the gifts is like, nearly just a fucking fork.

3243
02:22:56,090 --> 02:22:57,550
Like, what the fuck?

3244
02:22:59,390 --> 02:23:00,690
It's just a fork.

3245
02:23:05,830 --> 02:23:06,630
Oh, nice!

3246
02:23:08,490 --> 02:23:10,470
I don't know, I just thought it was kind of blue.

3247
02:23:14,610 --> 02:23:16,510
A special fork.

3248
02:23:16,510 --> 02:23:17,590
Hahaha!

3249
02:23:21,210 --> 02:23:23,450
There's like a door right here.

3250
02:23:24,590 --> 02:23:25,010
Like...

3251
02:23:25,010 --> 02:23:25,350
Here?

3252
02:23:28,010 --> 02:23:28,380
Alright...

3253
02:23:28,750 --> 02:23:30,270
Wait, where is it?

3254
02:23:32,010 --> 02:23:34,130
There's like a door somewhere here.

3255
02:23:36,410 --> 02:23:38,010
You guys see it, right?

3256
02:23:39,040 --> 02:23:39,690
Oh, here.

3257
02:23:40,330 --> 02:23:41,370
There it is.

3258
02:23:44,350 --> 02:23:45,370
Okay, there we go.

3259
02:23:47,890 --> 02:23:50,150
I should open it if I insert something here.

3260
02:23:50,510 --> 02:23:51,890
What do I insert there, though?

3261
02:23:54,030 --> 02:23:54,470
Charity?

3262
02:23:54,750 --> 02:23:55,190
No?

3263
02:23:56,550 --> 02:23:57,990
I don't have any other orbs.

3264
02:24:04,060 --> 02:24:04,800
Okay, yeah.

3265
02:24:04,920 --> 02:24:06,240
No, I don't know if I could do that.

3266
02:24:06,520 --> 02:24:06,920
Hahaha!

3267
02:24:07,160 --> 02:24:07,760
I don't know!

3268
02:24:13,740 --> 02:24:14,260
What?

3269
02:24:14,640 --> 02:24:15,740
Who's shooting me?

3270
02:24:18,100 --> 02:24:19,440
Oh, all the way here.

3271
02:24:21,180 --> 02:24:22,080
Oh, fuck!

3272
02:24:22,420 --> 02:24:23,200
Oh my god.

3273
02:24:24,500 --> 02:24:25,280
The map!

3274
02:24:25,440 --> 02:24:26,500
You won this time!

3275
02:24:29,660 --> 02:24:31,240
Okay, oh, I got the other one!

3276
02:24:36,130 --> 02:24:38,030
I got the other one, but where...

3277
02:24:38,030 --> 02:24:39,410
Where's that supposed to be?

3278
02:24:39,690 --> 02:24:40,410
Is that a gift?

3279
02:24:40,630 --> 02:24:40,910
No.

3280
02:24:40,910 --> 02:24:41,010
Oh.

3281
02:24:42,150 --> 02:24:43,650
My naughty navel.

3282
02:24:43,870 --> 02:24:44,170
Hahaha!

3283
02:24:46,490 --> 02:24:46,930
Sorry.

3284
02:24:47,450 --> 02:24:47,970
Hahaha!

3285
02:24:54,240 --> 02:24:55,280
There it is.

3286
02:25:02,290 --> 02:25:02,850
Okay.

3287
02:25:04,890 --> 02:25:05,890
Oh my god.

3288
02:25:06,030 --> 02:25:07,850
Like, sometimes I just can't shield fast.

3289
02:25:08,090 --> 02:25:08,310
Ah!

3290
02:25:08,810 --> 02:25:10,650
I hate that you can't...

3291
02:25:10,650 --> 02:25:12,790
You can't fucking- Ah!

3292
02:25:13,750 --> 02:25:14,310
Ow!

3293
02:25:16,400 --> 02:25:17,140
Okay, I got it.

3294
02:25:17,180 --> 02:25:17,500
I'm okay.

3295
02:25:17,720 --> 02:25:18,300
I'm okay.

3296
02:25:21,930 --> 02:25:24,350
Sometimes I just can't block fast enough.

3297
02:25:24,650 --> 02:25:25,670
And it's like...

3298
02:25:25,670 --> 02:25:26,270
A little tilting.

3299
02:25:26,770 --> 02:25:27,950
When you can't do it in time.

3300
02:25:30,610 --> 02:25:31,310
Jesus.

3301
02:25:34,390 --> 02:25:35,090
No!

3302
02:25:35,430 --> 02:25:36,470
Not what I wanted!

3303
02:25:36,670 --> 02:25:36,870
No!

3304
02:25:38,170 --> 02:25:38,870
Stop!

3305
02:25:39,250 --> 02:25:40,470
I wanna kill him!

3306
02:25:41,070 --> 02:25:41,770
Stop!

3307
02:25:43,990 --> 02:25:46,190
I don't wanna kill you!

3308
02:25:46,190 --> 02:25:46,310
No!

3309
02:25:50,710 --> 02:25:51,370
Alright.

3310
02:25:51,890 --> 02:25:54,890
I kept auto-targeting these two over there.

3311
02:26:00,900 --> 02:26:02,100
Yeah, but...

3312
02:26:02,100 --> 02:26:02,620
There's like...

3313
02:26:02,620 --> 02:26:03,760
An area right...

3314
02:26:03,760 --> 02:26:04,120
There.

3315
02:26:04,520 --> 02:26:05,320
That ghost...

3316
02:26:05,320 --> 02:26:05,540
Oh!

3317
02:26:05,640 --> 02:26:07,820
That's the secret area that I need to find.

3318
02:26:08,400 --> 02:26:09,300
Oh, there's this chest.

3319
02:26:10,900 --> 02:26:11,800
Oh, nice.

3320
02:26:11,960 --> 02:26:12,040
T.

3321
02:26:15,970 --> 02:26:16,630
Alright.

3322
02:26:16,630 --> 02:26:18,830
I should have everything, right?

3323
02:26:19,470 --> 02:26:20,870
Yeah, that should be everything.

3324
02:26:22,590 --> 02:26:23,150
Alright.

3325
02:26:28,170 --> 02:26:30,850
Yeah, I don't have a thing for this, so...

3326
02:26:30,850 --> 02:26:31,870
I gotta find it.

3327
02:26:35,010 --> 02:26:37,670
Yeah, now imagine if I had 10 controls.

3328
02:26:40,470 --> 02:26:43,090
This is technically easier than before.

3329
02:26:44,890 --> 02:26:47,810
Cause back then it was a lot harder to play these games.

3330
02:26:53,040 --> 02:26:53,800
There we go.

3331
02:26:57,420 --> 02:26:59,120
Alright, I go home now.

3332
02:27:03,540 --> 02:27:04,360
Oh, nice.

3333
02:27:04,660 --> 02:27:05,800
That's what I needed, actually.

3334
02:27:10,460 --> 02:27:12,200
I still can't believe it.

3335
02:27:12,340 --> 02:27:13,520
I was so greedy.

3336
02:27:14,220 --> 02:27:14,300
Alright.

3337
02:27:19,760 --> 02:27:23,020
There must be like lock on in this game, right?

3338
02:27:23,860 --> 02:27:25,220
Am I just missing it?

3339
02:27:32,840 --> 02:27:35,040
There must be a way to lock on.

3340
02:27:36,240 --> 02:27:37,520
Is it R1?

3341
02:27:37,980 --> 02:27:38,740
Is it?

3342
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:40,040
Oh my god.

3343
02:27:40,220 --> 02:27:41,380
I swear to god.

3344
02:27:41,760 --> 02:27:42,880
If it what is...

3345
02:27:42,880 --> 02:27:43,460
No, it's not.

3346
02:27:43,580 --> 02:27:44,760
R1 is the map.

3347
02:27:45,700 --> 02:27:46,420
Is this turn?

3348
02:27:48,580 --> 02:27:49,620
Is it RB?

3349
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:56,480
No, because like...

3350
02:27:56,480 --> 02:27:57,960
It can't be because...

3351
02:27:57,960 --> 02:27:58,500
Um...

3352
02:27:58,500 --> 02:27:59,140
It's not RB.

3353
02:28:00,900 --> 02:28:02,000
It's not RB.

3354
02:28:10,740 --> 02:28:11,480
Is it?

3355
02:28:11,580 --> 02:28:11,760
No.

3356
02:28:11,940 --> 02:28:12,460
That's just turn.

3357
02:28:14,720 --> 02:28:15,840
Are you so...

3358
02:28:15,840 --> 02:28:16,660
Oh, you fucker!

3359
02:28:18,240 --> 02:28:18,840
Nice.

3360
02:28:20,860 --> 02:28:21,460
Alright.

3361
02:28:25,100 --> 02:28:25,700
L1?

3362
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:26,140
No.

3363
02:28:26,820 --> 02:28:28,180
Yeah, I don't think it has...

3364
02:28:28,180 --> 02:28:29,420
I don't think there is lock on.

3365
02:28:32,880 --> 02:28:33,860
I hate you.

3366
02:28:37,760 --> 02:28:38,880
I fucking...

3367
02:28:38,880 --> 02:28:39,640
Jesus Christ.

3368
02:28:39,840 --> 02:28:40,560
This stupid arrow.

3369
02:28:45,130 --> 02:28:46,170
Oh my god.

3370
02:28:46,190 --> 02:28:47,170
He's still there.

3371
02:28:54,720 --> 02:28:55,140
Okay.

3372
02:28:57,320 --> 02:28:58,060
That's it.

3373
02:28:59,480 --> 02:29:00,240
That's it.

3374
02:29:01,160 --> 02:29:02,200
I've had enough.

3375
02:29:04,840 --> 02:29:06,080
I've had enough.

3376
02:29:06,340 --> 02:29:06,520
I've had enough.

3377
02:29:06,640 --> 02:29:08,600
You've arrowed your last...

3378
02:29:08,600 --> 02:29:09,760
Your last mass.

3379
02:29:15,140 --> 02:29:16,580
I'm like...

3380
02:29:16,580 --> 02:29:17,520
That's it.

3381
02:29:21,200 --> 02:29:22,540
I've had enough.

3382
02:29:23,040 --> 02:29:24,000
Oh, you too?

3383
02:29:24,360 --> 02:29:25,340
Oh my god.

3384
02:29:34,430 --> 02:29:35,390
That's it.

3385
02:29:43,840 --> 02:29:45,680
Don't piss me off.

3386
02:29:47,760 --> 02:29:48,900
Oh my god.

3387
02:29:49,040 --> 02:29:50,080
That is friendly fire.

3388
02:29:56,920 --> 02:29:57,680
No.

3389
02:30:00,300 --> 02:30:00,820
No.

3390
02:30:01,740 --> 02:30:02,780
Nobody likes...

3391
02:30:02,780 --> 02:30:03,900
Is this how...

3392
02:30:03,900 --> 02:30:06,180
Is this how they felt when I was playing...

3393
02:30:06,180 --> 02:30:06,840
Is this it?

3394
02:30:06,920 --> 02:30:07,880
Is this how they felt?

3395
02:30:08,120 --> 02:30:11,020
Is that why I had to take all that stab?

3396
02:30:11,560 --> 02:30:12,680
Is that it?

3397
02:30:13,320 --> 02:30:17,060
Was that how they felt when I was the archer and night ring?

3398
02:30:21,560 --> 02:30:22,160
Whoops.

3399
02:30:22,380 --> 02:30:22,940
I went backwards.

3400
02:30:24,400 --> 02:30:25,620
Now I understand.

3401
02:30:26,660 --> 02:30:28,440
Now I understand.

3402
02:30:35,200 --> 02:30:36,180
Get out of here.

3403
02:30:40,020 --> 02:30:42,200
I swear if you fucking come over here.

3404
02:30:42,620 --> 02:30:43,880
I swear to god.

3405
02:30:49,090 --> 02:30:49,710
Get over here.

3406
02:30:50,530 --> 02:30:51,270
Stop dancing.

3407
02:30:51,550 --> 02:30:52,270
Get over here.

3408
02:30:56,010 --> 02:30:57,610
No dancing for you.

3409
02:30:58,030 --> 02:30:59,170
Dancing is out loud.

3410
02:31:01,790 --> 02:31:02,970
It should be here.

3411
02:31:14,670 --> 02:31:15,270
Wait.

3412
02:31:15,710 --> 02:31:17,050
She can just do that?

3413
02:31:19,010 --> 02:31:20,090
What the fuck?

3414
02:31:26,520 --> 02:31:27,300
Oh my god.

3415
02:31:27,320 --> 02:31:27,820
Are you okay?

3416
02:31:29,640 --> 02:31:30,620
You're a demon.

3417
02:31:30,780 --> 02:31:31,620
Just regenerate.

3418
02:31:41,630 --> 02:31:42,230
Mom?

3419
02:31:46,100 --> 02:31:50,320
I wanted much more time to talk with you.

3420
02:31:51,200 --> 02:31:51,780
Joe.

3421
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,540
I mean, you could have visited me whenever.

3422
02:31:56,940 --> 02:31:57,860
But like, that's cool.

3423
02:32:04,470 --> 02:32:07,210
I was like, I was like literally right next to your...

3424
02:32:07,560 --> 02:32:10,030
I was literally like, right next to you.

3425
02:32:10,270 --> 02:32:11,490
My village was next to you.

3426
02:32:12,210 --> 02:32:13,190
What happened?

3427
02:32:15,630 --> 02:32:17,170
I chose wrong.

3428
02:32:17,510 --> 02:32:18,350
The first time I met.

3429
02:32:18,730 --> 02:32:20,910
She revealed that she was my mother.

3430
02:32:22,430 --> 02:32:24,370
I chose wrong.

3431
02:32:24,370 --> 02:32:24,550
I chose wrong.

3432
02:32:25,070 --> 02:32:25,390
I chose my father.

3433
02:32:29,110 --> 02:32:32,150
One day, I met your father.

3434
02:32:32,730 --> 02:32:35,890
And fell in love with him at first sight.

3435
02:32:40,580 --> 02:32:42,020
Oh, that's my dad.

3436
02:32:50,420 --> 02:32:52,780
Wait, did she have the snake body too?

3437
02:32:53,020 --> 02:32:53,780
When they met?

3438
02:32:54,140 --> 02:32:55,400
Bro, he's a freak.

3439
02:32:56,300 --> 02:32:57,260
He saw...

3440
02:32:57,580 --> 02:32:59,300
Bro, she saw the...

3441
02:33:00,060 --> 02:33:02,960
The snake body and was like, yes.

3442
02:33:03,860 --> 02:33:04,500
Finally.

3443
02:33:04,500 --> 02:33:04,700
Finally.

3444
02:33:05,680 --> 02:33:05,740
Hahaha.

3445
02:33:12,370 --> 02:33:13,110
It...

3446
02:33:13,110 --> 02:33:15,090
It was destiny.

3447
02:33:18,870 --> 02:33:19,610
What?

3448
02:33:23,090 --> 02:33:25,050
Hear me out.

3449
02:33:25,490 --> 02:33:25,890
Hahaha.

3450
02:33:26,330 --> 02:33:28,030
This woman told me that.

3451
02:33:28,130 --> 02:33:30,250
It is the Yagyu clan's mission.

3452
02:33:30,470 --> 02:33:31,810
To stop the demons.

3453
02:33:32,130 --> 02:33:34,270
When they rise up to the surface.

3454
02:33:35,950 --> 02:33:37,850
For this, the chief of the Yagyu clan...

3455
02:33:37,850 --> 02:33:38,450
He was like...

3456
02:33:38,450 --> 02:33:39,290
I thought...

3457
02:33:39,290 --> 02:33:41,010
I was just not into anything.

3458
02:33:41,290 --> 02:33:43,310
Until I saw...

3459
02:33:43,310 --> 02:33:43,790
Hahaha.

3460
02:33:44,070 --> 02:33:45,390
The snake torso.

3461
02:33:46,530 --> 02:33:47,090
Earth.

3462
02:33:50,520 --> 02:33:52,500
And the demons of the underground...

3463
02:33:52,500 --> 02:33:53,580
Fought a great war.

3464
02:33:54,260 --> 02:33:55,700
In the end...

3465
02:33:55,700 --> 02:33:57,060
The demons won.

3466
02:33:57,760 --> 02:33:59,020
And the Oni...

3467
02:33:59,020 --> 02:33:59,660
Were scattered.

3468
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:07,660
I never knew my mother.

3469
02:34:08,320 --> 02:34:09,660
So a woman appeared...

3470
02:34:10,080 --> 02:34:11,180
All of a sudden...

3471
02:34:11,180 --> 02:34:12,260
And claimed to be my mother.

3472
02:34:12,640 --> 02:34:13,680
And stated...

3473
02:34:13,680 --> 02:34:16,360
That I have the blood of the Oni clan.

3474
02:34:17,660 --> 02:34:18,380
I...

3475
02:34:18,380 --> 02:34:20,140
Can't just accept it immediately.

3476
02:34:20,500 --> 02:34:20,960
I'm at.

3477
02:34:23,960 --> 02:34:25,840
You have demons.

3478
02:34:27,280 --> 02:34:27,300
Huh?

3479
02:34:30,820 --> 02:34:31,100
Oh?

3480
02:34:33,240 --> 02:34:34,320
Sucker up.

3481
02:34:34,500 --> 02:34:35,260
Sucker soul.

3482
02:34:35,580 --> 02:34:36,720
That's XP right there.

3483
02:34:37,020 --> 02:34:37,320
No!

3484
02:34:37,320 --> 02:34:37,500
No!

3485
02:34:38,260 --> 02:34:40,020
You're wasting XP!

3486
02:34:40,860 --> 02:34:41,540
Jubei!

3487
02:34:42,920 --> 02:34:44,620
But if it's true...

3488
02:34:44,620 --> 02:34:47,120
If this is my destiny...

3489
02:34:47,120 --> 02:34:47,820
I'll accept it.

3490
02:34:48,720 --> 02:34:49,340
The XP!

3491
02:34:49,340 --> 02:34:50,620
I'll be this Oni warrior.

3492
02:34:51,140 --> 02:34:52,640
And I will destroy the demons!

3493
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:54,440
Yay!

3494
02:34:56,840 --> 02:34:59,420
Oh, that XP is just floating away!

3495
02:35:01,440 --> 02:35:02,560
What a waste!

3496
02:35:04,440 --> 02:35:06,120
That could have been on my sword!

3497
02:35:18,680 --> 02:35:19,860
Oh my god!

3498
02:35:20,580 --> 02:35:21,740
Oh, there's the ring!

3499
02:35:22,580 --> 02:35:24,060
Wait, my house is dead, God.

3500
02:35:24,380 --> 02:35:25,080
What the fuck?

3501
02:35:26,060 --> 02:35:28,100
But my girlfriend just left!

3502
02:35:28,920 --> 02:35:30,040
My soon-to-be girlfriend!

3503
02:35:30,200 --> 02:35:30,920
Don't worry, guys!

3504
02:35:31,740 --> 02:35:32,200
My...

3505
02:35:32,200 --> 02:35:33,660
My soon...

3506
02:35:33,660 --> 02:35:34,360
Okay, not that!

3507
02:35:34,580 --> 02:35:36,460
My soon-to-be girlfriend!

3508
02:35:38,420 --> 02:35:40,220
Lali, thank you, thank you for the super chat!

3509
02:35:40,540 --> 02:35:41,400
Thank you, thank you!

3510
02:35:41,680 --> 02:35:41,960
Thank you!

3511
02:35:42,120 --> 02:35:47,560
Okay, please understand, she couldn't visit him because she was busy studying marine biology!

3512
02:35:47,920 --> 02:35:51,860
Guys, does this only work on her or does it work on any of the...

3513
02:35:51,860 --> 02:35:52,520
Any of my...

3514
02:35:53,100 --> 02:35:53,580
Friends?

3515
02:35:59,180 --> 02:36:00,400
I'm just curious.

3516
02:36:02,460 --> 02:36:03,760
Oh, new monster!

3517
02:36:04,860 --> 02:36:05,660
Oh, what?

3518
02:36:08,260 --> 02:36:08,880
Oh.

3519
02:36:09,530 --> 02:36:10,640
Oh, I have to get...

3520
02:36:10,640 --> 02:36:11,260
Try and hit...

3521
02:36:11,260 --> 02:36:12,760
I have to hit it when...

3522
02:36:14,700 --> 02:36:15,840
That makes sense.

3523
02:36:19,040 --> 02:36:19,220
Okay.

3524
02:36:22,300 --> 02:36:25,200
Never know till we try it out!

3525
02:36:26,620 --> 02:36:28,780
This is important, guys!

3526
02:36:30,420 --> 02:36:33,400
I spent $3,000 on these rings!

3527
02:36:39,720 --> 02:36:40,400
Nice.

3528
02:36:44,400 --> 02:36:45,580
Oh my god, please!

3529
02:36:46,200 --> 02:36:47,820
Look into my eyes!

3530
02:36:50,340 --> 02:36:51,780
Open your eyes!

3531
02:36:57,730 --> 02:36:58,070
Okay.

3532
02:36:59,670 --> 02:37:00,010
Nice.

3533
02:37:02,650 --> 02:37:03,830
Oh shit, I didn't see him.

3534
02:37:09,100 --> 02:37:10,200
Nice, okay.

3535
02:37:11,180 --> 02:37:11,900
Got him.

3536
02:37:13,380 --> 02:37:14,060
Get over here.

3537
02:37:14,060 --> 02:37:15,940
I need that extra XP.

3538
02:37:17,480 --> 02:37:19,480
I couldn't suck up my...

3539
02:37:19,480 --> 02:37:22,040
My mom's XP, so I need it off of you guys.

3540
02:37:26,190 --> 02:37:26,670
Yeah!

3541
02:37:27,830 --> 02:37:30,130
Okay, now that I have the ring, I can go back.

3542
02:37:33,610 --> 02:37:34,470
Swear to god.

3543
02:37:35,770 --> 02:37:36,650
Oh my god.

3544
02:37:36,770 --> 02:37:38,050
I swear...

3545
02:37:38,050 --> 02:37:38,790
I swear!

3546
02:37:40,290 --> 02:37:42,090
I just wanna kill you.

3547
02:37:43,610 --> 02:37:44,570
I don't care.

3548
02:37:44,730 --> 02:37:46,410
I don't care about anyone else here.

3549
02:37:46,810 --> 02:37:47,990
It's just you.

3550
02:37:52,330 --> 02:37:53,250
Oh shit.

3551
02:37:53,610 --> 02:37:54,810
Oh my god, I got ricochet there.

3552
02:37:55,410 --> 02:37:56,650
Oh my god.

3553
02:37:58,790 --> 02:37:59,650
Oh nice.

3554
02:37:59,930 --> 02:38:00,530
Friendly fire.

3555
02:38:01,630 --> 02:38:02,450
Thank god for that.

3556
02:38:06,110 --> 02:38:07,030
Oh my god.

3557
02:38:07,230 --> 02:38:07,410
Oh my god.

3558
02:38:07,790 --> 02:38:09,710
I have to do the extra suck before I get near.

3559
02:38:10,070 --> 02:38:11,090
Oh my god!

3560
02:38:11,770 --> 02:38:12,690
You fucker.

3561
02:38:15,350 --> 02:38:16,290
Get over here!

3562
02:38:19,810 --> 02:38:20,890
Okay, nice.

3563
02:38:22,030 --> 02:38:22,590
Enhance.

3564
02:38:23,090 --> 02:38:23,870
Short time.

3565
02:38:26,290 --> 02:38:28,070
Should I be enhancing my armor?

3566
02:38:28,070 --> 02:38:29,570
Do I get better...

3567
02:38:29,570 --> 02:38:30,330
Oh my god.

3568
02:38:30,530 --> 02:38:30,830
I...

3569
02:38:30,830 --> 02:38:33,050
I have not been giving a fuck about my armor.

3570
02:38:34,510 --> 02:38:36,570
I just realized I had...

3571
02:38:36,570 --> 02:38:38,750
Do we get better armor later?

3572
02:38:38,750 --> 02:38:40,470
Or is this the only armor we have?

3573
02:38:41,930 --> 02:38:42,890
I don't...

3574
02:38:42,890 --> 02:38:43,830
I don't remember.

3575
02:38:52,380 --> 02:38:53,880
Okay, I think it was...

3576
02:38:54,420 --> 02:38:54,640
Here?

3577
02:38:56,020 --> 02:38:57,360
And then here?

3578
02:38:58,820 --> 02:38:59,840
And then this way.

3579
02:39:00,200 --> 02:39:00,800
Okay, I remember.

3580
02:39:04,630 --> 02:39:06,930
Okay, and then we gotta put the ring.

3581
02:39:07,730 --> 02:39:09,470
My dead mom's ring.

3582
02:39:10,710 --> 02:39:11,490
Yay!

3583
02:39:15,900 --> 02:39:16,680
Oh.

3584
02:39:18,140 --> 02:39:21,380
Yes, I need to turn the place and complete the picture.

3585
02:39:22,720 --> 02:39:23,300
What?

3586
02:39:26,890 --> 02:39:28,050
Oh no.

3587
02:39:29,670 --> 02:39:31,610
I can't read this.

3588
02:39:33,850 --> 02:39:34,630
Guys.

3589
02:39:36,830 --> 02:39:37,990
Guys, I can't read.

3590
02:39:39,310 --> 02:39:39,790
I...

3591
02:39:39,790 --> 02:39:41,290
I can't read.

3592
02:39:41,770 --> 02:39:42,250
Guys.

3593
02:39:44,330 --> 02:39:45,650
What do they read?

3594
02:39:46,310 --> 02:39:47,390
Which one's white?

3595
02:39:47,650 --> 02:39:48,270
I don't remember.

3596
02:39:50,850 --> 02:39:52,190
Is this Norse...

3597
02:39:52,190 --> 02:39:52,490
What?

3598
02:39:59,330 --> 02:40:01,990
Okay, I must have had a book about this.

3599
02:40:06,010 --> 02:40:07,230
Do I have a...

3600
02:40:07,230 --> 02:40:07,910
Oh, there we go.

3601
02:40:08,130 --> 02:40:08,710
Okay, there we go.

3602
02:40:08,910 --> 02:40:10,450
Okay, black, blue, red, white.

3603
02:40:10,450 --> 02:40:10,790
Okay.

3604
02:40:11,350 --> 02:40:12,250
Okay, I found a...

3605
02:40:12,250 --> 02:40:13,490
Okay, black, blue, red, white.

3606
02:40:13,690 --> 02:40:13,830
Okay.

3607
02:40:14,630 --> 02:40:15,690
Okay, I got it.

3608
02:40:17,350 --> 02:40:17,830
Black...

3609
02:40:21,650 --> 02:40:22,130
Blue...

3610
02:40:23,650 --> 02:40:24,130
Red...

3611
02:40:24,130 --> 02:40:24,810
What?

3612
02:40:27,130 --> 02:40:28,010
There we go.

3613
02:40:31,620 --> 02:40:32,100
Yay!

3614
02:40:33,280 --> 02:40:34,780
Down the ladder I'll go.

3615
02:40:34,780 --> 02:40:34,820
Oh.

3616
02:40:38,420 --> 02:40:39,100
Okay.

3617
02:40:39,760 --> 02:40:40,100
Nice.

3618
02:40:40,200 --> 02:40:41,070
There's nothing here that...

3619
02:40:41,640 --> 02:40:43,260
I need to worry about.

3620
02:40:43,820 --> 02:40:44,600
Other than that.

3621
02:40:48,560 --> 02:40:49,960
Honestly, I...

3622
02:40:50,310 --> 02:40:51,420
Didn't think that would work.

3623
02:40:55,860 --> 02:40:56,560
Oh.

3624
02:40:58,360 --> 02:41:00,200
That might have been a mistake.

3625
02:41:04,240 --> 02:41:08,040
I just, you know, figured the first time it did...

3626
02:41:08,040 --> 02:41:08,780
It went okay.

3627
02:41:09,580 --> 02:41:10,620
So then...

3628
02:41:10,620 --> 02:41:12,800
The second time it would be okay.

3629
02:41:14,540 --> 02:41:16,020
Wait, is it still...

3630
02:41:16,020 --> 02:41:16,800
Heading over?

3631
02:41:20,860 --> 02:41:22,220
Is it like...

3632
02:41:22,220 --> 02:41:22,740
Heading over?

3633
02:41:25,240 --> 02:41:25,920
Like...

3634
02:41:26,860 --> 02:41:28,160
What is it doing?

3635
02:41:29,440 --> 02:41:34,140
What is it doing?

3636
02:41:34,920 --> 02:41:36,300
Is it still...

3637
02:41:36,300 --> 02:41:36,700
There?

3638
02:41:40,220 --> 02:41:41,300
Oh, it is.

3639
02:41:46,120 --> 02:41:46,860
There.

3640
02:41:48,860 --> 02:41:49,500
You...

3641
02:41:53,340 --> 02:41:54,440
Oh, f...

3642
02:41:54,440 --> 02:41:55,400
Oh, shit.

3643
02:41:56,340 --> 02:41:56,740
Oh, shit.

3644
02:41:58,460 --> 02:41:59,600
Oh, shit.

3645
02:42:00,200 --> 02:42:00,540
Oh, shit.

3646
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:01,760
Okay, I got...

3647
02:42:01,760 --> 02:42:02,300
I got...

3648
02:42:02,300 --> 02:42:03,120
Confused.

3649
02:42:03,360 --> 02:42:03,800
Okay, there.

3650
02:42:03,940 --> 02:42:04,200
Okay.

3651
02:42:04,720 --> 02:42:04,860
Okay.

3652
02:42:07,240 --> 02:42:08,440
I got...

3653
02:42:08,440 --> 02:42:10,340
I got really confused.

3654
02:42:10,600 --> 02:42:11,140
I got...

3655
02:42:12,180 --> 02:42:13,260
I don't know.

3656
02:42:13,580 --> 02:42:16,060
For some reason, I thought it would just disappear.

3657
02:42:16,640 --> 02:42:17,040
I...

3658
02:42:20,900 --> 02:42:22,280
It was just...

3659
02:42:22,280 --> 02:42:22,780
I thought...

3660
02:42:22,780 --> 02:42:23,200
I don't know.

3661
02:42:23,360 --> 02:42:25,960
I just thought it would just disappear for some reason.

3662
02:42:26,320 --> 02:42:28,060
I don't know why I thought that.

3663
02:42:33,470 --> 02:42:34,150
Oh, wait.

3664
02:42:34,550 --> 02:42:35,830
It's a different color now.

3665
02:42:36,230 --> 02:42:37,070
It's purple.

3666
02:42:40,510 --> 02:42:41,570
Oh my god, stop.

3667
02:42:42,810 --> 02:42:43,770
I'm having...

3668
02:42:43,770 --> 02:42:44,530
Oh my god, please.

3669
02:42:44,750 --> 02:42:45,810
I will use magic.

3670
02:42:45,810 --> 02:42:46,330
I'm done.

3671
02:42:48,270 --> 02:42:49,530
I don't care anymore.

3672
02:42:54,420 --> 02:42:55,300
Go over here.

3673
02:42:58,720 --> 02:42:59,160
Alright.

3674
02:43:01,060 --> 02:43:01,960
Get over here.

3675
02:43:02,400 --> 02:43:03,000
That's right.

3676
02:43:04,500 --> 02:43:05,240
Oh my god.

3677
02:43:05,360 --> 02:43:06,920
He wants to join in the fun, too.

3678
02:43:07,540 --> 02:43:08,700
He's like, let me at him.

3679
02:43:08,900 --> 02:43:09,860
Let me at him.

3680
02:43:10,660 --> 02:43:11,100
Let me at him!

3681
02:43:11,100 --> 02:43:11,400
Don't worry.

3682
02:43:11,520 --> 02:43:12,300
I'm coming over.

3683
02:43:12,480 --> 02:43:12,820
Come on.

3684
02:43:13,280 --> 02:43:14,620
Just drop down, buddy.

3685
02:43:15,720 --> 02:43:16,820
Just drop down.

3686
02:43:17,080 --> 02:43:18,740
You can be part of the fun, too.

3687
02:43:19,760 --> 02:43:20,340
Just...

3688
02:43:20,340 --> 02:43:21,000
Alright.

3689
02:43:21,240 --> 02:43:22,900
Just let me slowly climb up.

3690
02:43:23,100 --> 02:43:24,320
And then you can join in.

3691
02:43:24,480 --> 02:43:25,040
There you go.

3692
02:43:25,660 --> 02:43:26,680
Are you happy now?

3693
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:28,120
Did you have fun?

3694
02:43:28,640 --> 02:43:29,760
There we go.

3695
02:43:30,400 --> 02:43:31,220
Did you...

3696
02:43:31,740 --> 02:43:33,420
Did you have fun, sir?

3697
02:43:36,720 --> 02:43:37,340
Yeah.

3698
02:43:37,460 --> 02:43:38,120
Was that fun?

3699
02:43:38,720 --> 02:43:39,560
Was that...

3700
02:43:42,340 --> 02:43:44,980
Did you have fun over there?

3701
02:43:46,080 --> 02:43:47,380
It was so...

3702
02:43:47,380 --> 02:43:49,080
You look like a fucking puppy.

3703
02:43:49,320 --> 02:43:49,840
He's like...

3704
02:43:49,840 --> 02:43:50,260
Oh my god!

3705
02:43:50,400 --> 02:43:51,100
It's my dude!

3706
02:43:51,340 --> 02:43:52,120
It's my dude!

3707
02:43:53,900 --> 02:43:54,420
Alright.

3708
02:43:54,820 --> 02:43:56,980
Using some kind of trick, I can't open it?

3709
02:43:57,140 --> 02:43:58,220
What the fuck is the trick?

3710
02:44:00,100 --> 02:44:01,280
Oh, let's do this.

3711
02:44:01,280 --> 02:44:02,040
This is green, right?

3712
02:44:05,240 --> 02:44:06,340
Is this not green?

3713
02:44:08,300 --> 02:44:09,400
Or is that blue?

3714
02:44:14,130 --> 02:44:14,910
That's blue?

3715
02:44:15,170 --> 02:44:16,330
It's still not opening.

3716
02:44:19,510 --> 02:44:20,490
Give me a sec.

3717
02:44:20,670 --> 02:44:20,930
Buddy!

3718
02:44:22,690 --> 02:44:23,210
Buddy!

3719
02:44:27,400 --> 02:44:29,640
Oh, I need green sword?

3720
02:44:30,180 --> 02:44:30,360
Oh!

3721
02:44:31,580 --> 02:44:32,100
Okay.

3722
02:44:32,980 --> 02:44:33,900
I was gonna say...

3723
02:44:33,900 --> 02:44:34,240
What the fuck?

3724
02:44:34,340 --> 02:44:35,680
Do I just not know colors anymore?

3725
02:44:36,260 --> 02:44:36,780
Like...

3726
02:44:36,780 --> 02:44:37,120
Am I...

3727
02:44:37,120 --> 02:44:39,620
There's no way I just suddenly became colorblind.

3728
02:44:40,340 --> 02:44:40,860
Like...

3729
02:44:40,860 --> 02:44:42,080
That's not...

3730
02:44:42,080 --> 02:44:43,180
That can't be it.

3731
02:44:45,140 --> 02:44:46,180
That's like...

3732
02:44:46,180 --> 02:44:47,440
That just suddenly...

3733
02:44:47,440 --> 02:44:47,860
Like...

3734
02:44:47,860 --> 02:44:50,080
When you get older, you just become colorblind?

3735
02:44:50,580 --> 02:44:51,100
Like...

3736
02:44:51,100 --> 02:44:51,660
Like...

3737
02:44:51,660 --> 02:44:52,920
What the fuck is going on?

3738
02:44:55,600 --> 02:44:56,340
I'm gonna fuck this.

3739
02:44:56,400 --> 02:44:57,520
I don't like these guys, too.

3740
02:45:03,740 --> 02:45:03,840
Okay.

3741
02:45:06,180 --> 02:45:06,540
Nice.

3742
02:45:08,980 --> 02:45:11,120
Okay, I gotta make sure I got these guys out of the way.

3743
02:45:15,700 --> 02:45:16,060
Okay.

3744
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:17,840
Oh my god!

3745
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:19,100
You can do that?!

3746
02:45:21,940 --> 02:45:23,900
I'm just gonna block for now, just in case.

3747
02:45:26,580 --> 02:45:27,180
There's...

3748
02:45:27,180 --> 02:45:28,140
Jesus, what?!

3749
02:45:31,990 --> 02:45:33,810
There's no pattern for that!

3750
02:45:34,270 --> 02:45:35,370
He just...

3751
02:45:35,370 --> 02:45:35,950
Chucks it!

3752
02:45:37,050 --> 02:45:38,690
Brandon, thank you the super chat.

3753
02:45:38,830 --> 02:45:39,650
Thank you, thank you.

3754
02:45:40,710 --> 02:45:41,930
I got the herb.

3755
02:45:44,610 --> 02:45:45,950
I got another map.

3756
02:45:48,310 --> 02:45:48,910
Oh.

3757
02:45:49,470 --> 02:45:50,530
Oh, thank god!

3758
02:45:50,630 --> 02:45:51,170
I got the...

3759
02:45:51,170 --> 02:45:51,910
I got the...

3760
02:45:51,910 --> 02:45:52,530
Green sword.

3761
02:45:58,060 --> 02:45:58,660
Nice!

3762
02:45:59,120 --> 02:46:00,560
Oh, it's a double sword!

3763
02:46:01,940 --> 02:46:02,440
Whoa!

3764
02:46:03,480 --> 02:46:04,340
That's cool!

3765
02:46:06,760 --> 02:46:08,620
Alright, let's try this one out.

3766
02:46:09,960 --> 02:46:10,560
Sen...

3767
02:46:10,560 --> 02:46:11,760
Senpumaru.

3768
02:46:14,280 --> 02:46:15,180
Let's save.

3769
02:46:19,890 --> 02:46:20,490
Nice.

3770
02:46:20,850 --> 02:46:22,630
Oh my god, it counts my save.

3771
02:46:22,770 --> 02:46:23,450
Don't look at it.

3772
02:46:23,450 --> 02:46:23,810
I...

3773
02:46:25,590 --> 02:46:27,130
I just realized...

3774
02:46:27,130 --> 02:46:28,610
It counts my save.

3775
02:46:29,010 --> 02:46:30,130
Don't judge me!

3776
02:46:30,490 --> 02:46:31,770
Don't judge me!

3777
02:46:34,230 --> 02:46:34,830
Don't judge me!

3778
02:46:35,690 --> 02:46:36,890
Jesus Christ.

3779
02:46:40,190 --> 02:46:44,250
Okay, I wanna go back, cause now that I have this, I can unlock the area.

3780
02:46:47,470 --> 02:46:48,630
Oh, fucking Christ.

3781
02:46:48,950 --> 02:46:50,730
Oh my god, that's it.

3782
02:46:50,830 --> 02:46:51,330
Shoot him.

3783
02:46:53,530 --> 02:46:54,970
Oh, you're not gonna shoot him?

3784
02:46:55,110 --> 02:46:56,210
Okay, I see how it...

3785
02:46:56,210 --> 02:46:57,290
I see how it is.

3786
02:46:58,910 --> 02:47:02,660
I see how it is.

3787
02:47:03,060 --> 02:47:03,580
Nice.

3788
02:47:03,920 --> 02:47:04,440
That's fine.

3789
02:47:07,020 --> 02:47:08,280
I'll take those.

3790
02:47:13,380 --> 02:47:13,900
Okay.

3791
02:47:14,640 --> 02:47:15,700
I'll get him...

3792
02:47:15,700 --> 02:47:16,340
Rid of him first.

3793
02:47:17,020 --> 02:47:17,860
Jesus Christ.

3794
02:47:22,580 --> 02:47:25,940
It's gonna take you a while to fucking get that arrow in.

3795
02:47:27,580 --> 02:47:28,400
Okay, nice.

3796
02:47:30,700 --> 02:47:32,960
Okay, I need a...

3797
02:47:32,960 --> 02:47:33,560
There we go.

3798
02:47:33,840 --> 02:47:34,480
I see it.

3799
02:47:35,480 --> 02:47:36,620
Down I go.

3800
02:47:39,220 --> 02:47:39,780
Okay.

3801
02:47:42,820 --> 02:47:44,240
Oh nice, I broke it.

3802
02:47:44,480 --> 02:47:44,740
Yay!

3803
02:47:46,640 --> 02:47:47,660
What the fuck?

3804
02:47:48,340 --> 02:47:49,660
What the fuck was that?

3805
02:47:55,040 --> 02:47:56,780
Like, what do I get out of that?

3806
02:47:57,260 --> 02:47:57,920
Like, what do I get out of that?

3807
02:47:58,520 --> 02:47:59,280
Oh, this...

3808
02:47:59,280 --> 02:48:00,340
This one's weak.

3809
02:48:00,880 --> 02:48:02,080
I don't know if I like it.

3810
02:48:05,040 --> 02:48:06,480
I'll just use it for the magic.

3811
02:48:06,820 --> 02:48:09,100
I'm not really a huge fan, because he seems really...

3812
02:48:09,100 --> 02:48:10,360
It seems like such a weak one.

3813
02:48:13,620 --> 02:48:16,180
Yeah, it's like fast hit, but pretty weak.

3814
02:48:16,480 --> 02:48:17,120
What the fuck?

3815
02:48:17,320 --> 02:48:18,440
I stabbed you!

3816
02:48:18,800 --> 02:48:21,660
Oh my god, it doesn't even do final hit for it too.

3817
02:48:22,200 --> 02:48:23,440
Yeah, I don't know if I like it.

3818
02:48:23,680 --> 02:48:24,680
I think I can do it twice.

3819
02:48:25,140 --> 02:48:26,100
Okay, this one...

3820
02:48:26,100 --> 02:48:26,920
Final hit it.

3821
02:48:30,120 --> 02:48:34,200
Yeah, I even like stabbed him in the belly and he still lives.

3822
02:48:35,820 --> 02:48:37,200
Yeah, the fatal blow...

3823
02:48:37,760 --> 02:48:38,440
Is it a level?

3824
02:48:39,020 --> 02:48:39,700
Could be.

3825
02:48:43,880 --> 02:48:44,900
Yeah, if it's...

3826
02:48:44,900 --> 02:48:45,880
I'm gonna...

3827
02:48:45,880 --> 02:48:48,060
I'll wait until I level it up first.

3828
02:48:51,840 --> 02:48:52,280
Jesus.

3829
02:48:52,740 --> 02:48:53,560
What the fuck?

3830
02:48:53,660 --> 02:48:54,660
Why is there another guy?

3831
02:48:57,940 --> 02:48:59,840
Oh my god, he's slowly heading over to me.

3832
02:49:05,770 --> 02:49:06,210
Jesus!

3833
02:49:11,770 --> 02:49:12,370
Oh my god.

3834
02:49:12,530 --> 02:49:13,010
Oh my god.

3835
02:49:13,070 --> 02:49:13,590
Oh my god.

3836
02:49:13,650 --> 02:49:14,190
Oh my god.

3837
02:49:14,290 --> 02:49:15,030
I'm getting doubled.

3838
02:49:16,350 --> 02:49:16,750
Oh.

3839
02:49:17,110 --> 02:49:17,450
There we go.

3840
02:49:17,550 --> 02:49:17,810
It's fine.

3841
02:49:20,910 --> 02:49:21,450
It's okay.

3842
02:49:22,890 --> 02:49:24,930
I can suck this before I go in.

3843
02:49:28,840 --> 02:49:29,620
Oh, it's fine.

3844
02:49:31,200 --> 02:49:31,600
What?

3845
02:49:33,240 --> 02:49:34,000
Oh my god.

3846
02:49:34,120 --> 02:49:35,680
I'm being really cocky right now.

3847
02:49:40,340 --> 02:49:41,100
Nice hole.

3848
02:49:41,440 --> 02:49:41,740
Come on.

3849
02:49:41,820 --> 02:49:42,580
Heels, heals, heals, heals.

3850
02:49:42,980 --> 02:49:44,280
Okay, just a little bit.

3851
02:49:44,280 --> 02:49:44,940
That's okay.

3852
02:49:46,160 --> 02:49:48,440
No, I gotta save the magic!

3853
02:49:50,920 --> 02:49:52,180
Okay, that's fine.

3854
02:49:53,820 --> 02:49:56,160
Being a little too cocky right now.

3855
02:49:59,080 --> 02:49:59,820
Enhance.

3856
02:50:01,220 --> 02:50:03,200
I don't even think I have enough to enhance.

3857
02:50:03,620 --> 02:50:05,860
Oh, this is gonna take a while to enhance too.

3858
02:50:13,290 --> 02:50:14,190
Get outta here.

3859
02:50:15,250 --> 02:50:15,950
Oh, nice heals.

3860
02:50:16,570 --> 02:50:17,230
That's good.

3861
02:50:18,270 --> 02:50:20,230
I'm glad I got the heals last minute too.

3862
02:50:20,850 --> 02:50:22,890
Cause I was definitely not okay.

3863
02:50:23,590 --> 02:50:25,730
Oh, that was a big heal suck too.

3864
02:50:28,830 --> 02:50:29,890
That's right.

3865
02:50:32,910 --> 02:50:34,510
You're so weak.

3866
02:50:35,650 --> 02:50:37,130
You're so weak.

3867
02:50:37,290 --> 02:50:37,590
You're so weak.

3868
02:50:37,590 --> 02:50:38,810
You're just father to me.

3869
02:50:40,470 --> 02:50:41,710
That's right.

3870
02:50:42,750 --> 02:50:44,650
Nobody loves you.

3871
02:50:45,970 --> 02:50:48,550
Not even your demon daddy.

3872
02:50:49,370 --> 02:50:50,470
That's right.

3873
02:50:50,710 --> 02:50:51,290
Get stabbed.

3874
02:50:52,390 --> 02:50:54,250
You're just XP for me.

3875
02:50:56,590 --> 02:50:57,550
What's easing?

3876
02:50:58,310 --> 02:50:58,710
Guys.

3877
02:51:00,410 --> 02:51:01,230
What's that?

3878
02:51:01,350 --> 02:51:02,570
Let me read my book.

3879
02:51:06,350 --> 02:51:06,910
Enhancement.

3880
02:51:07,070 --> 02:51:07,490
What's that?

3881
02:51:07,650 --> 02:51:08,610
Is that the charge attack?

3882
02:51:12,750 --> 02:51:14,190
What the fuck is...

3883
02:51:14,190 --> 02:51:15,530
What do you want me to use?

3884
02:51:18,990 --> 02:51:19,790
Oh, wait.

3885
02:51:20,750 --> 02:51:21,570
What is that?

3886
02:51:28,640 --> 02:51:29,200
Wait.

3887
02:51:29,900 --> 02:51:31,760
Am I not...

3888
02:51:32,160 --> 02:51:33,020
You not hit it?

3889
02:51:38,260 --> 02:51:39,420
You not hit that?

3890
02:51:42,040 --> 02:51:43,060
What the fuck?

3891
02:51:48,100 --> 02:51:49,100
What is that?

3892
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:52,540
What?

3893
02:51:52,540 --> 02:51:52,760
He just...

3894
02:51:53,380 --> 02:51:54,180
He left.

3895
02:51:55,220 --> 02:51:56,180
How do I...

3896
02:51:56,180 --> 02:51:56,580
What?

3897
02:51:58,740 --> 02:51:59,280
What?

3898
02:52:00,300 --> 02:52:01,800
He just blew away.

3899
02:52:03,120 --> 02:52:05,840
What does that do?

3900
02:52:09,380 --> 02:52:10,360
And this guy.

3901
02:52:10,600 --> 02:52:11,480
Oh, I'm sorry.

3902
02:52:11,480 --> 02:52:13,300
I didn't know what the fuck that was.

3903
02:52:18,340 --> 02:52:20,120
I tried to figure it out.

3904
02:52:23,240 --> 02:52:24,740
I didn't mean to use magic.

3905
02:52:24,900 --> 02:52:25,760
God damn it.

3906
02:52:26,440 --> 02:52:27,220
I'm sad.

3907
02:52:31,440 --> 02:52:32,260
I'm sad.

3908
02:52:32,440 --> 02:52:33,920
I didn't mean to use magic there.

3909
02:52:37,920 --> 02:52:38,440
Alright.

3910
02:52:38,700 --> 02:52:39,200
Sucked.

3911
02:52:41,140 --> 02:52:42,300
Oh, he's still alive?

3912
02:52:45,440 --> 02:52:45,960
Nice.

3913
02:52:46,100 --> 02:52:46,560
I got fire.

3914
02:52:46,780 --> 02:52:47,520
We actually need that.

3915
02:52:50,960 --> 02:52:51,480
Okay.

3916
02:52:52,480 --> 02:52:52,880
Oh.

3917
02:52:53,340 --> 02:52:54,600
That's magic too.

3918
02:52:54,840 --> 02:52:55,700
We actually need that too.

3919
02:52:57,240 --> 02:52:58,080
Get over here.

3920
02:53:00,120 --> 02:53:00,840
Suck.

3921
02:53:03,020 --> 02:53:03,740
Nice.

3922
02:53:05,520 --> 02:53:07,180
More fire arrows.

3923
02:53:07,360 --> 02:53:08,300
I'm so lost.

3924
02:53:10,600 --> 02:53:11,320
Like...

3925
02:53:11,320 --> 02:53:11,920
What?

3926
02:53:17,550 --> 02:53:18,030
This?

3927
02:53:23,670 --> 02:53:25,190
Are you supposed to tell me where to go?

3928
02:53:26,970 --> 02:53:28,030
Where do I go?

3929
02:53:28,290 --> 02:53:28,430
Oh.

3930
02:53:28,710 --> 02:53:29,330
Wait, I killed him.

3931
02:53:30,610 --> 02:53:31,070
Oh.

3932
02:53:31,750 --> 02:53:32,830
Oh, I just...

3933
02:53:32,830 --> 02:53:34,570
Oh, I was just supposed to stab him.

3934
02:53:34,810 --> 02:53:35,030
Oh.

3935
02:53:36,710 --> 02:53:37,470
Oh, nice.

3936
02:53:37,630 --> 02:53:38,190
I did it.

3937
02:53:38,470 --> 02:53:38,790
Yay.

3938
02:53:39,370 --> 02:53:39,650
Murder.

3939
02:53:41,070 --> 02:53:41,550
See?

3940
02:53:41,970 --> 02:53:43,530
Murder is sometimes okay.

3941
02:53:43,530 --> 02:53:43,630
Okay.

3942
02:53:49,200 --> 02:53:50,020
Get out of here.

3943
02:53:52,140 --> 02:53:52,620
Oh, yeah.

3944
02:53:52,740 --> 02:53:54,860
If you don't know what you do, just start swinging.

3945
02:53:58,940 --> 02:54:01,920
If you don't know what you're doing, just start swinging.

3946
02:54:04,520 --> 02:54:06,400
Eventually, something good will happen, right?

3947
02:54:09,840 --> 02:54:10,200
Alright.

3948
02:54:10,460 --> 02:54:10,640
Nice.

3949
02:54:15,180 --> 02:54:15,620
Okay.

3950
02:54:17,220 --> 02:54:19,220
I don't know how I'm gonna get to him.

3951
02:54:19,780 --> 02:54:20,360
Oh my god.

3952
02:54:20,460 --> 02:54:20,720
Please.

3953
02:54:22,720 --> 02:54:23,580
Oh my god.

3954
02:54:23,800 --> 02:54:24,380
Oh my...

3955
02:54:24,380 --> 02:54:24,700
Please.

3956
02:54:25,780 --> 02:54:26,220
I'm...

3957
02:54:27,840 --> 02:54:28,680
Oh, I got him.

3958
02:54:28,760 --> 02:54:29,060
I got him.

3959
02:54:29,120 --> 02:54:29,460
I got him.

3960
02:54:29,520 --> 02:54:29,900
I got him.

3961
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:30,480
Oh, thank god.

3962
02:54:30,640 --> 02:54:30,760
Okay.

3963
02:54:33,500 --> 02:54:34,420
I got him.

3964
02:54:34,620 --> 02:54:35,540
I got him.

3965
02:54:36,060 --> 02:54:37,240
That was...

3966
02:54:37,240 --> 02:54:39,200
That was just so difficult.

3967
02:54:43,090 --> 02:54:44,470
That was so frustrating.

3968
02:54:46,170 --> 02:54:48,090
Cause it's like...

3969
02:54:48,090 --> 02:54:49,370
What the fuck?

3970
02:54:49,450 --> 02:54:50,510
It just shred me like that.

3971
02:54:50,930 --> 02:54:51,870
What the...

3972
02:54:56,060 --> 02:54:56,680
That's it.

3973
02:54:57,720 --> 02:54:58,200
I'm...

3974
02:54:58,200 --> 02:54:58,800
I'm done.

3975
02:55:01,980 --> 02:55:02,620
That's it.

3976
02:55:02,760 --> 02:55:03,920
You fucked around too much.

3977
02:55:09,310 --> 02:55:09,790
Jesus.

3978
02:55:10,130 --> 02:55:10,270
Okay.

3979
02:55:10,630 --> 02:55:10,990
That's good.

3980
02:55:12,730 --> 02:55:15,930
I'm worried I'm gonna accidentally go backwards and then have to redo this again.

3981
02:55:17,690 --> 02:55:18,430
Okay.

3982
02:55:18,470 --> 02:55:20,490
That's nice that I know that I can stagger.

3983
02:55:20,630 --> 02:55:21,350
Are you serious?

3984
02:55:24,700 --> 02:55:25,890
Get outta here!

3985
02:55:26,750 --> 02:55:28,370
That's fucking right!

3986
02:55:29,470 --> 02:55:30,990
Now give me my HP back.

3987
02:55:33,770 --> 02:55:35,250
Are you serious?

3988
02:55:35,470 --> 02:55:36,450
Oh my god.

3989
02:55:36,610 --> 02:55:37,310
Now they're...

3990
02:55:37,310 --> 02:55:38,130
Oh my god!

3991
02:55:46,820 --> 02:55:47,190
No.

3992
02:55:49,250 --> 02:55:50,170
No!

3993
02:55:50,890 --> 02:55:51,510
No!

3994
02:55:59,630 --> 02:56:00,550
Thanks.

3995
02:56:00,730 --> 02:56:01,210
I just started...

3996
02:56:01,210 --> 02:56:02,250
Oh and I lost everything.

3997
02:56:02,810 --> 02:56:03,270
I...

3998
02:56:04,510 --> 02:56:04,970
Thanks.

3999
02:56:05,130 --> 02:56:06,110
I just started swinging.

4000
02:56:07,110 --> 02:56:08,330
My XP gone.

4001
02:56:13,190 --> 02:56:14,350
No suck.

4002
02:56:17,250 --> 02:56:18,210
No suck.

4003
02:56:19,550 --> 02:56:20,650
Is that her?

4004
02:56:21,610 --> 02:56:22,490
Oh my god.

4005
02:56:22,630 --> 02:56:23,030
It's her.

4006
02:56:29,880 --> 02:56:30,360
Her.

4007
02:56:32,780 --> 02:56:34,300
Lady, I chose wrong.

4008
02:56:47,030 --> 02:56:49,510
Bro, she like killed my mom who's like...

4009
02:56:49,510 --> 02:56:50,090
A bit...

4010
02:56:50,090 --> 02:56:51,090
Like a stronger demon.

4011
02:56:51,350 --> 02:56:52,270
I don't know what I can do.

4012
02:56:58,170 --> 02:57:00,230
You gotta live with your choices, guys.

4013
02:57:01,510 --> 02:57:03,690
You gotta live with your choices.

4014
02:57:04,410 --> 02:57:05,210
Haha.

4015
02:57:05,830 --> 02:57:06,010
What?

4016
02:57:10,110 --> 02:57:10,910
Whoa.

4017
02:57:11,590 --> 02:57:11,810
Chill.

4018
02:57:12,050 --> 02:57:13,290
There's enough Jubei for...

4019
02:57:13,290 --> 02:57:15,470
There's enough Jubei for everyone.

4020
02:57:16,230 --> 02:57:18,030
I told you I'd be back.

4021
02:57:18,930 --> 02:57:20,310
I'm immortal.

4022
02:57:22,270 --> 02:57:24,730
Wait, does that make my mom still alive?

4023
02:57:24,730 --> 02:57:24,830
What?

4024
02:57:25,550 --> 02:57:26,230
No.

4025
02:57:26,370 --> 02:57:27,370
No, he's just dead dead.

4026
02:57:29,310 --> 02:57:31,290
Wait a second, gingham fats.

4027
02:57:31,710 --> 02:57:34,510
This cute little man is mine to play with.

4028
02:57:34,870 --> 02:57:35,330
No.

4029
02:57:35,590 --> 02:57:37,010
I claim his life.

4030
02:57:37,710 --> 02:57:39,610
Alright, you go first.

4031
02:57:40,050 --> 02:57:42,210
I know you'll lose again anyway.

4032
02:57:42,650 --> 02:57:43,110
Whoa.

4033
02:57:43,450 --> 02:57:43,790
Damn.

4034
02:57:45,330 --> 02:57:46,330
How dare you.

4035
02:57:46,970 --> 02:57:47,470
Damn.

4036
02:57:47,470 --> 02:57:47,730
Damn.

4037
02:57:51,850 --> 02:57:52,950
Alright, I know...

4038
02:57:54,170 --> 02:57:55,770
Don't worry, I got this.

4039
02:57:56,690 --> 02:57:57,570
I have...

4040
02:57:57,570 --> 02:58:00,290
I might not have gun man with me to...

4041
02:58:02,130 --> 02:58:02,590
Whoops.

4042
02:58:02,850 --> 02:58:03,790
Okay, now...

4043
02:58:03,790 --> 02:58:04,950
Now I got this.

4044
02:58:05,090 --> 02:58:06,590
Now, now, now, now I got this.

4045
02:58:06,670 --> 02:58:07,390
Now I got this, guys.

4046
02:58:07,830 --> 02:58:09,550
Now, now, now...

4047
02:58:10,690 --> 02:58:11,610
Guys, now...

4048
02:58:11,610 --> 02:58:13,310
Now I know what I'm doing.

4049
02:58:17,310 --> 02:58:20,050
Okay, that was awkward, but...

4050
02:58:20,050 --> 02:58:20,910
I now know what I'm...

4051
02:58:20,910 --> 02:58:22,390
I definitely know what I'm doing this time.

4052
02:58:25,850 --> 02:58:28,210
I know it seemed like I didn't before.

4053
02:58:32,030 --> 02:58:32,550
Okay.

4054
02:58:33,370 --> 02:58:34,510
Wait, I can't absorb this.

4055
02:58:36,230 --> 02:58:37,550
Okay, and then...

4056
02:58:38,450 --> 02:58:40,210
Okay, I can swap...

4057
02:58:40,210 --> 02:58:41,710
Wait, it's like...

4058
02:58:42,970 --> 02:58:45,270
Okay, I wanna know how to swap my weapon...

4059
02:58:45,270 --> 02:58:46,250
Oh my, I'll just do this.

4060
02:58:46,430 --> 02:58:47,510
I don't remember the...

4061
02:58:47,510 --> 02:58:48,870
The thing to swap the weapon.

4062
02:58:49,290 --> 02:58:49,630
Easily.

4063
02:58:50,430 --> 02:58:50,870
Yeah.

4064
02:58:52,390 --> 02:58:52,830
Okay.

4065
02:58:53,070 --> 02:58:53,670
That's good.

4066
02:58:56,630 --> 02:58:57,510
And then...

4067
02:58:59,390 --> 02:58:59,830
Again!

4068
02:59:01,110 --> 02:59:01,970
Wait, where is he?

4069
02:59:02,670 --> 02:59:03,110
Oh.

4070
02:59:03,650 --> 02:59:04,010
Wait.

4071
02:59:04,390 --> 02:59:05,510
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

4072
02:59:05,810 --> 02:59:06,250
Wait.

4073
02:59:06,870 --> 02:59:08,090
Wait, wait, wait.

4074
02:59:08,210 --> 02:59:08,530
Bro!

4075
02:59:08,830 --> 02:59:09,270
Bro!

4076
02:59:09,270 --> 02:59:11,950
Are you serius?

4077
02:59:28,970 --> 02:59:30,250
What am I...

4078
02:59:30,250 --> 02:59:31,610
I'm so sad.

4079
02:59:32,410 --> 02:59:33,810
I'm so sad.

4080
02:59:34,330 --> 02:59:35,210
I'm...

4081
02:59:35,210 --> 02:59:36,750
I'm so sad.

4082
02:59:40,190 --> 02:59:41,090
I...

4083
02:59:41,090 --> 02:59:41,130
I...

4084
02:59:56,390 --> 02:59:57,330
I'm so...

4085
02:59:57,330 --> 02:59:57,850
Yeah.

4086
02:59:59,150 --> 03:00:02,770
I'm so... I can't...

4087
03:00:05,330 --> 03:00:08,090
Are you fucking...

4088
03:00:13,700 --> 03:00:14,480
Okay.

4089
03:00:16,700 --> 03:00:17,580
Okay.

4090
03:00:33,840 --> 03:00:35,700
He he he he.

4091
03:00:40,300 --> 03:00:44,160
He he he he he.

4092
03:00:48,890 --> 03:00:50,110
He he he.

4093
03:00:50,990 --> 03:00:52,310
Oh shit, fuck!

4094
03:00:52,470 --> 03:00:52,850
Oh fuck!

4095
03:00:52,990 --> 03:00:53,270
He actually!

4096
03:00:53,530 --> 03:00:53,790
He'd me!

4097
03:00:54,230 --> 03:00:54,830
He'd!

4098
03:00:54,850 --> 03:00:54,970
He actually!

4099
03:00:55,010 --> 03:00:56,250
He actually did it!

4100
03:01:01,670 --> 03:01:02,270
Okay.

4101
03:01:02,550 --> 03:01:02,810
Okay.

4102
03:01:02,890 --> 03:01:03,610
I figure it out.

4103
03:01:05,030 --> 03:01:05,630
Okay.

4104
03:01:05,750 --> 03:01:07,290
He actually that madman.

4105
03:01:07,290 --> 03:01:09,950
You actually hee heed me correctly.

4106
03:01:10,290 --> 03:01:11,670
I wasn't paying attention.

4107
03:01:11,930 --> 03:01:12,590
Was that noticeable?

4108
03:01:14,970 --> 03:01:15,750
Oh shit.

4109
03:01:16,390 --> 03:01:19,490
I was trying to cr- I... It's so hard to time.

4110
03:01:21,030 --> 03:01:22,050
Oh my god.

4111
03:01:22,850 --> 03:01:23,930
Holy fuck.

4112
03:01:30,040 --> 03:01:30,600
Jesus.

4113
03:01:35,230 --> 03:01:35,790
Okay.

4114
03:01:36,250 --> 03:01:37,250
No, not that, not that.

4115
03:01:39,610 --> 03:01:42,450
Oh, whoah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah!

4116
03:01:42,470 --> 03:01:43,950
Oh, whoah, woah!

4117
03:01:44,390 --> 03:01:45,410
He's a lot faster now!

4118
03:01:45,850 --> 03:01:46,050
Whoa!

4119
03:01:46,550 --> 03:01:47,590
Whoa, guys.

4120
03:01:47,770 --> 03:01:49,230
He's a-he's really fast now!

4121
03:01:56,420 --> 03:01:57,100
Okay.

4122
03:02:00,660 --> 03:02:01,340
No.

4123
03:02:02,900 --> 03:02:03,920
Not again!

4124
03:02:04,220 --> 03:02:05,160
Not again!

4125
03:02:06,660 --> 03:02:07,800
Not again!

4126
03:02:07,800 --> 03:02:08,500
And...

4127
03:02:13,980 --> 03:02:14,460
Okay.

4128
03:02:15,380 --> 03:02:17,320
He has like... two hits here.

4129
03:02:20,860 --> 03:02:21,340
No!

4130
03:02:21,560 --> 03:02:21,920
No, no, no!

4131
03:02:23,540 --> 03:02:24,700
Okay, I have to heal.

4132
03:02:27,320 --> 03:02:28,740
Oh my god, I have to heal.

4133
03:02:32,580 --> 03:02:33,780
Oh, thank god!

4134
03:02:34,280 --> 03:02:35,060
There we go!

4135
03:02:35,060 --> 03:02:35,080
No!

4136
03:02:41,700 --> 03:02:42,840
Oh, I'm saying!

4137
03:02:43,040 --> 03:02:44,440
You would have died a lot sooner?

4138
03:02:45,540 --> 03:02:46,140
When...

4139
03:02:46,800 --> 03:02:47,420
If I...

4140
03:02:47,420 --> 03:02:49,500
If I didn't fuck up my second ult!

4141
03:02:50,980 --> 03:02:53,200
My stupid second ult!

4142
03:02:53,480 --> 03:02:54,480
Oh my god!

4143
03:02:54,860 --> 03:02:55,700
He's like...

4144
03:02:55,700 --> 03:02:56,380
He he he!

4145
03:02:57,260 --> 03:02:57,860
He...

4146
03:02:57,860 --> 03:02:59,640
Which way do I go?

4147
03:03:01,380 --> 03:03:02,620
Is it this way?

4148
03:03:05,380 --> 03:03:05,980
Okay.

4149
03:03:07,560 --> 03:03:08,160
Stupid.

4150
03:03:08,520 --> 03:03:09,220
He he he.

4151
03:03:17,650 --> 03:03:18,950
Oh my god.

4152
03:03:20,770 --> 03:03:21,630
Wait, what the?

4153
03:03:21,830 --> 03:03:22,450
What the fuck?

4154
03:03:24,910 --> 03:03:26,950
Oh my god, there's like babies, too.

4155
03:03:30,110 --> 03:03:31,750
Jesus Christ, there's so many.

4156
03:03:33,790 --> 03:03:36,290
Oh my god, I can't believe...

4157
03:03:36,290 --> 03:03:37,890
They're so tanky!

4158
03:03:38,710 --> 03:03:39,190
This is it.

4159
03:03:39,290 --> 03:03:39,710
I'm angry.

4160
03:03:43,170 --> 03:03:46,870
Oh my god, it takes that much to kill a child?

4161
03:03:54,840 --> 03:03:55,400
Jesus!

4162
03:03:57,600 --> 03:03:58,600
Okay, there we go.

4163
03:03:59,160 --> 03:03:59,480
There we go.

4164
03:03:59,680 --> 03:04:00,800
I got the crit for that.

4165
03:04:04,390 --> 03:04:06,390
Jesus, they're so tanky.

4166
03:04:06,670 --> 03:04:08,650
They're so fucking tanky.

4167
03:04:13,300 --> 03:04:15,800
Oh my god, how many children do you have?

4168
03:04:19,260 --> 03:04:20,260
Get out of here!

4169
03:04:20,800 --> 03:04:22,280
Your parents are dead!

4170
03:04:25,500 --> 03:04:26,800
Get out of here!

4171
03:04:27,000 --> 03:04:27,960
I've killed your parents!

4172
03:04:36,320 --> 03:04:37,600
Jesus Christ!

4173
03:04:39,680 --> 03:04:41,180
Oh my god, there's more?!

4174
03:04:41,740 --> 03:04:42,100
What?!

4175
03:04:45,800 --> 03:04:46,680
Is that an egg?

4176
03:04:46,800 --> 03:04:47,740
Oh, this is where they live.

4177
03:04:47,900 --> 03:04:48,120
Whoops.

4178
03:04:48,340 --> 03:04:48,640
Sorry.

4179
03:04:49,820 --> 03:04:50,180
Hmm.

4180
03:04:50,380 --> 03:04:52,140
I may or may not be the bad guy.

4181
03:04:52,140 --> 03:04:53,140
Hahaha!

4182
03:04:57,020 --> 03:04:57,360
Hey!

4183
03:04:58,700 --> 03:04:58,820
Ooh!

4184
03:04:59,720 --> 03:05:00,200
Whoa!

4185
03:05:00,820 --> 03:05:01,080
Oops!

4186
03:05:01,860 --> 03:05:03,420
That was...

4187
03:05:03,420 --> 03:05:04,300
They live here!

4188
03:05:04,920 --> 03:05:05,600
Hahaha!

4189
03:05:07,700 --> 03:05:08,220
Whoopsie!

4190
03:05:09,160 --> 03:05:09,300
Yeah!

4191
03:05:10,720 --> 03:05:11,700
Awkward!

4192
03:05:12,840 --> 03:05:13,580
Whoa!

4193
03:05:14,120 --> 03:05:17,020
There's a slight chance I just killed...

4194
03:05:17,020 --> 03:05:18,260
I just...

4195
03:05:18,260 --> 03:05:19,060
I just made...

4196
03:05:19,060 --> 03:05:20,080
Did a home invasion.

4197
03:05:20,480 --> 03:05:21,020
Maybe.

4198
03:05:22,720 --> 03:05:23,320
Haha!

4199
03:05:24,000 --> 03:05:24,420
Maybe.

4200
03:05:24,720 --> 03:05:25,860
Just a maybe, guys.

4201
03:05:27,040 --> 03:05:27,640
Oh...

4202
03:05:27,640 --> 03:05:28,680
Whoa!

4203
03:05:29,100 --> 03:05:30,500
This might be where I get crushed.

4204
03:05:33,980 --> 03:05:34,940
Oh, I have...

4205
03:05:34,940 --> 03:05:35,720
Two of them.

4206
03:05:41,380 --> 03:05:42,940
Wait, where's the other ones?

4207
03:05:47,560 --> 03:05:48,780
Did I miss one?

4208
03:05:50,800 --> 03:05:51,400
Oh...

4209
03:05:51,400 --> 03:05:51,920
Guys!

4210
03:05:52,200 --> 03:05:53,820
I did not pay attention!

4211
03:05:54,580 --> 03:05:55,180
Hahaha!

4212
03:06:00,840 --> 03:06:02,920
Did you pay attention?

4213
03:06:03,480 --> 03:06:04,880
Did you...

4214
03:06:04,880 --> 03:06:06,740
Did you pay attention?

4215
03:06:07,280 --> 03:06:08,340
At Croc!

4216
03:06:08,520 --> 03:06:09,340
Which way?

4217
03:06:10,960 --> 03:06:13,160
Because I definitely did not.

4218
03:06:13,980 --> 03:06:15,540
At Croc!

4219
03:06:15,720 --> 03:06:16,980
At Croc!

4220
03:06:17,420 --> 03:06:18,020
At Croc!

4221
03:06:18,020 --> 03:06:18,180
Guys!

4222
03:06:18,680 --> 03:06:19,760
At Croc!

4223
03:06:24,080 --> 03:06:24,960
Oh!

4224
03:06:29,160 --> 03:06:30,480
Oh, thank God.

4225
03:06:30,640 --> 03:06:31,480
Nothing bad happens.

4226
03:06:31,700 --> 03:06:32,380
Oh, thank God.

4227
03:06:32,540 --> 03:06:32,740
Okay.

4228
03:06:33,760 --> 03:06:34,320
Okay.

4229
03:06:35,500 --> 03:06:37,700
Oh, I can't pull the lever again.

4230
03:06:38,160 --> 03:06:38,680
That's...

4231
03:06:38,680 --> 03:06:39,120
Oh...

4232
03:06:39,120 --> 03:06:39,680
Oh...

4233
03:06:39,680 --> 03:06:39,860
Guys!

4234
03:06:40,100 --> 03:06:41,460
I can't pull it again.

4235
03:06:51,030 --> 03:06:52,630
Wait, I missed one.

4236
03:06:52,890 --> 03:06:54,250
Where did the last one...

4237
03:06:54,250 --> 03:06:55,350
Oh my God.

4238
03:06:57,190 --> 03:06:59,010
I missed one?

4239
03:07:01,750 --> 03:07:03,750
Oh no, there's another area I didn't go.

4240
03:07:04,540 --> 03:07:05,290
Okay, thank God.

4241
03:07:09,770 --> 03:07:10,730
Oh hey, look!

4242
03:07:10,970 --> 03:07:11,650
A new...

4243
03:07:11,650 --> 03:07:12,330
New family!

4244
03:07:14,010 --> 03:07:15,090
New family!

4245
03:07:16,010 --> 03:07:16,850
Look at that!

4246
03:07:16,910 --> 03:07:17,690
See, guys?

4247
03:07:17,970 --> 03:07:19,910
I'm not that bad of a person.

4248
03:07:20,050 --> 03:07:21,230
A new family moved in!

4249
03:07:22,970 --> 03:07:23,910
Look at that!

4250
03:07:28,730 --> 03:07:29,250
What the...

4251
03:07:29,250 --> 03:07:30,410
I'm not that bad of a person!

4252
03:07:30,590 --> 03:07:31,950
New family moved in, guys!

4253
03:07:32,390 --> 03:07:32,910
WTF.

4254
03:07:33,650 --> 03:07:34,050
What?

4255
03:07:34,050 --> 03:07:35,350
What is going on?!

4256
03:07:38,390 --> 03:07:39,890
Jesus Christ, I'm leaving.

4257
03:07:40,230 --> 03:07:41,330
You guys can live there!

4258
03:07:42,630 --> 03:07:44,070
You guys can live there!

4259
03:07:44,070 --> 03:07:44,610
I'm leaving!

4260
03:07:47,650 --> 03:07:50,590
Yeah, I should have level 3 and level 2 now.

4261
03:07:54,460 --> 03:07:55,000
Alright.

4262
03:07:57,060 --> 03:07:58,260
Oh, whoops.

4263
03:08:00,720 --> 03:08:02,920
Okay, no, that's not where I wanted to go.

4264
03:08:04,060 --> 03:08:06,380
I wanted to go this way.

4265
03:08:07,780 --> 03:08:09,300
Yeah, there's another area here.

4266
03:08:14,560 --> 03:08:15,440
Whoa, whoa.

4267
03:08:15,800 --> 03:08:16,380
Oh my god.

4268
03:08:16,500 --> 03:08:16,880
Oh my god.

4269
03:08:23,560 --> 03:08:24,100
Okay.

4270
03:08:25,260 --> 03:08:26,020
Whoa, fuck.

4271
03:08:26,120 --> 03:08:27,060
He choked me.

4272
03:08:33,120 --> 03:08:34,620
It looked so fancy.

4273
03:08:40,270 --> 03:08:41,810
Okay, like, I didn't expect it.

4274
03:08:41,930 --> 03:08:44,690
He, like, it looked so... he was, like, doing some cool moves.

4275
03:08:44,830 --> 03:08:46,250
So then I was like, whoa, look at him go.

4276
03:08:46,830 --> 03:08:47,330
You know?

4277
03:08:50,830 --> 03:08:52,010
Like, look at him go.

4278
03:08:58,090 --> 03:08:58,450
Yes.

4279
03:08:59,310 --> 03:08:59,670
Jesus.

4280
03:09:03,670 --> 03:09:05,770
I wish I could time the crit better.

4281
03:09:06,010 --> 03:09:07,790
But I'm so bad at timing it.

4282
03:09:12,020 --> 03:09:12,540
Alright.

4283
03:09:12,800 --> 03:09:14,960
That should be... that should be the statue.

4284
03:09:15,540 --> 03:09:16,460
The last one.

4285
03:09:16,680 --> 03:09:17,300
Yeah, it was.

4286
03:09:17,780 --> 03:09:19,280
Alright, most likely I might get crushed.

4287
03:09:20,460 --> 03:09:21,360
Most likely.

4288
03:09:23,120 --> 03:09:23,940
I don't know.

4289
03:09:23,960 --> 03:09:25,840
I have a bad feeling about it.

4290
03:09:31,630 --> 03:09:32,150
Okay.

4291
03:09:32,150 --> 03:09:33,190
Where's this area?

4292
03:09:37,410 --> 03:09:39,030
I don't know how to open that.

4293
03:09:41,470 --> 03:09:42,810
Oh, there's more children.

4294
03:09:44,270 --> 03:09:45,470
They all live here?

4295
03:09:45,730 --> 03:09:46,650
Alright, let's leave.

4296
03:09:46,850 --> 03:09:48,590
I don't want to deal with these kids.

4297
03:09:53,900 --> 03:09:54,420
Fuck.

4298
03:09:54,640 --> 03:09:55,400
Okay, I need to go back.

4299
03:09:59,370 --> 03:09:59,890
Alright.

4300
03:10:00,130 --> 03:10:01,410
What the fuck you?

4301
03:10:03,490 --> 03:10:04,010
Alright.

4302
03:10:06,910 --> 03:10:08,350
Alright, we save here.

4303
03:10:11,970 --> 03:10:12,970
And then...

4304
03:10:15,610 --> 03:10:16,650
Alright, let's leave.

4305
03:10:16,850 --> 03:10:17,810
I don't want to deal...

4306
03:10:17,810 --> 03:10:19,130
I'm not a home invader.

4307
03:10:21,470 --> 03:10:23,630
Alright, I most likely fucked this up already.

4308
03:10:23,850 --> 03:10:26,290
I most likely...

4309
03:10:26,850 --> 03:10:27,890
Fucked it up already.

4310
03:10:28,070 --> 03:10:30,110
Because I was definitely not paying attention.

4311
03:10:35,060 --> 03:10:36,120
Let's go gambling!

4312
03:10:40,440 --> 03:10:40,840
Oh...

4313
03:10:42,180 --> 03:10:42,580
Oh...

4314
03:10:42,700 --> 03:10:43,780
It was so close!

4315
03:10:47,160 --> 03:10:47,560
Wait!

4316
03:10:47,720 --> 03:10:48,460
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

4317
03:10:52,740 --> 03:10:53,140
Sword...

4318
03:10:53,140 --> 03:10:53,780
Cross.

4319
03:10:54,060 --> 03:10:54,640
Sword cross.

4320
03:10:54,880 --> 03:10:55,060
Okay.

4321
03:10:55,540 --> 03:10:56,420
Okay, okay, okay.

4322
03:10:57,300 --> 03:10:58,500
I know, I know now.

4323
03:11:00,840 --> 03:11:01,240
Sword...

4324
03:11:01,800 --> 03:11:02,860
I memorized it.

4325
03:11:02,940 --> 03:11:03,560
Oh, thank God.

4326
03:11:03,680 --> 03:11:04,220
Oh, thank God.

4327
03:11:05,380 --> 03:11:05,780
Sword.

4328
03:11:05,780 --> 03:11:05,860
Alright.

4329
03:11:08,980 --> 03:11:10,200
Sword, cross.

4330
03:11:11,880 --> 03:11:13,960
Okay, now, thank god.

4331
03:11:14,320 --> 03:11:17,160
Thank god, this game decided to be like, oh, it's okay.

4332
03:11:17,460 --> 03:11:18,200
You get one.

4333
03:11:18,400 --> 03:11:19,380
Everyone gets one.

4334
03:11:19,600 --> 03:11:20,920
Everyone gets one.

4335
03:11:23,620 --> 03:11:24,440
There you go.

4336
03:11:25,320 --> 03:11:25,500
Yeah!

4337
03:11:29,520 --> 03:11:30,600
Oh, thank god.

4338
03:11:30,740 --> 03:11:31,020
Okay.

4339
03:11:31,320 --> 03:11:32,720
I gotta worry, not gonna lie.

4340
03:11:36,740 --> 03:11:38,660
There is a save near us.

4341
03:11:39,240 --> 03:11:40,220
I fucking knew it.

4342
03:11:40,320 --> 03:11:41,980
I heard those stupid boos.

4343
03:11:42,600 --> 03:11:43,020
Wait.

4344
03:11:43,780 --> 03:11:44,180
Where?

4345
03:11:44,760 --> 03:11:46,240
Oh, that's fucked up.

4346
03:11:46,380 --> 03:11:47,240
I run past it.

4347
03:11:48,280 --> 03:11:49,740
I'm not dealing with that.

4348
03:11:55,740 --> 03:11:56,860
What the fuck?

4349
03:11:58,200 --> 03:11:59,400
Oh my god.

4350
03:12:03,260 --> 03:12:04,760
Wait, what the fuck?

4351
03:12:04,760 --> 03:12:04,920
What the fuck?

4352
03:12:06,520 --> 03:12:07,660
Holy shit.

4353
03:12:08,180 --> 03:12:10,220
Oh shit, what the fuck?

4354
03:12:18,040 --> 03:12:18,680
Okay.

4355
03:12:21,080 --> 03:12:23,260
Those are some ladies.

4356
03:12:24,620 --> 03:12:25,520
You know what?

4357
03:12:25,560 --> 03:12:26,740
I'm just gonna use this.

4358
03:12:27,680 --> 03:12:31,060
I'm just gonna use this real quick.

4359
03:12:34,760 --> 03:12:36,680
Those were some ladies.

4360
03:12:37,960 --> 03:12:39,480
That's what they were.

4361
03:12:45,280 --> 03:12:46,260
Oh my god.

4362
03:12:46,420 --> 03:12:47,680
Oh, he just slammed into me.

4363
03:12:47,820 --> 03:12:48,160
You know what?

4364
03:12:48,580 --> 03:12:49,260
That's fair.

4365
03:12:50,280 --> 03:12:50,980
That's fair.

4366
03:12:51,320 --> 03:12:52,240
Oh my god.

4367
03:12:52,440 --> 03:12:53,540
I actually might die.

4368
03:12:56,360 --> 03:12:57,720
Let me grab...

4369
03:12:57,720 --> 03:12:58,660
Actually, no.

4370
03:12:58,800 --> 03:12:59,700
I believe in me.

4371
03:13:01,320 --> 03:13:01,800
Yeah.

4372
03:13:06,100 --> 03:13:06,900
Look at that.

4373
03:13:07,160 --> 03:13:08,300
I was so confident.

4374
03:13:08,620 --> 03:13:09,660
For no reason.

4375
03:13:16,360 --> 03:13:17,600
Holy shit.

4376
03:13:18,320 --> 03:13:19,540
Holy shit.

4377
03:13:20,260 --> 03:13:20,780
Ladies.

4378
03:13:26,440 --> 03:13:27,420
Hey, nice.

4379
03:13:30,720 --> 03:13:31,680
In the diary.

4380
03:13:31,900 --> 03:13:34,520
Oh my dearest Lord Nobunaga.

4381
03:13:34,760 --> 03:13:36,500
You're so beautiful today.

4382
03:13:36,960 --> 03:13:39,280
With your pretty hair and gorgeous body.

4383
03:13:39,700 --> 03:13:40,600
Lord Nobunaga.

4384
03:13:40,780 --> 03:13:42,420
Oh my Lord Nobunaga.

4385
03:13:42,620 --> 03:13:43,820
How cute you are.

4386
03:13:43,820 --> 03:13:48,380
The moment I gaze you upon your well-toned and sensual body.

4387
03:13:48,720 --> 03:13:51,380
Lie lifelessly before Jesus Christ.

4388
03:13:51,800 --> 03:13:54,780
I knew that you had captured more than just my heart.

4389
03:13:55,380 --> 03:13:57,000
I winly and lovely devote.

4390
03:13:57,620 --> 03:13:57,900
Damn.

4391
03:13:58,800 --> 03:14:04,320
Get yourself someone who is still in love with your dead body.

4392
03:14:05,140 --> 03:14:05,760
Okay, no.

4393
03:14:05,900 --> 03:14:06,200
Actually, no.

4394
03:14:06,240 --> 03:14:06,720
That's fucked up.

4395
03:14:06,840 --> 03:14:07,320
No, that's...

4396
03:14:07,320 --> 03:14:07,840
No, guys.

4397
03:14:07,940 --> 03:14:08,620
That's necrophilia.

4398
03:14:08,800 --> 03:14:09,320
Do not...

4399
03:14:09,320 --> 03:14:10,160
No, that's bad.

4400
03:14:10,500 --> 03:14:12,580
I know that you can sense my feelings.

4401
03:14:12,720 --> 03:14:13,500
My telepathy.

4402
03:14:13,940 --> 03:14:15,700
And yet, you do not even glance at me?

4403
03:14:16,220 --> 03:14:16,620
Why?

4404
03:14:17,000 --> 03:14:17,400
Why?

4405
03:14:17,820 --> 03:14:18,220
What?

4406
03:14:18,740 --> 03:14:20,440
How shy you must be.

4407
03:14:20,620 --> 03:14:22,320
But that just makes me love you more.

4408
03:14:22,740 --> 03:14:24,020
Maybe you think that I'm too.

4409
03:14:24,200 --> 03:14:25,780
And beautiful and dazzling for you.

4410
03:14:26,200 --> 03:14:28,840
Feeling like mine can often be a curse, I suppose.

4411
03:14:32,240 --> 03:14:33,720
That's bad, guys.

4412
03:14:34,240 --> 03:14:35,480
That is actually bad.

4413
03:14:40,970 --> 03:14:43,070
Alright, I guess I'm fighting her now?

4414
03:14:44,090 --> 03:14:44,450
I'm

4415
03:14:57,440 --> 03:14:59,200
fighting with you for a very long time.

4416
03:14:59,480 --> 03:15:00,600
Are you ready for me?

4417
03:15:01,500 --> 03:15:01,660
Yes.

4418
03:15:01,660 --> 03:15:01,980
Give it up.

4419
03:15:02,080 --> 03:15:05,000
No man would ever want to play with a nasty thing like you.

4420
03:15:05,780 --> 03:15:06,300
Oh.

4421
03:15:07,140 --> 03:15:09,300
I don't think you should make her mad.

4422
03:15:09,820 --> 03:15:12,380
She seems to be very strong.

4423
03:15:15,080 --> 03:15:15,600
She...

4424
03:15:15,600 --> 03:15:16,980
Oh!

4425
03:15:19,920 --> 03:15:23,080
Bro, she like sat on me.

4426
03:15:23,260 --> 03:15:23,940
Holy shit.

4427
03:15:24,860 --> 03:15:26,300
Oh my god.

4428
03:15:29,880 --> 03:15:31,620
Oh my god.

4429
03:15:32,020 --> 03:15:33,140
Oh my god.

4430
03:15:36,540 --> 03:15:37,860
Jesus Christ.

4431
03:15:38,120 --> 03:15:38,240
Okay.

4432
03:15:39,200 --> 03:15:40,500
What the...

4433
03:15:40,500 --> 03:15:40,780
Okay.

4434
03:15:41,480 --> 03:15:42,160
Okay, now I know.

4435
03:15:43,460 --> 03:15:45,260
Bro, I can't even get closer.

4436
03:15:48,730 --> 03:15:50,410
Bro, what?!

4437
03:15:50,410 --> 03:15:52,270
She's... She's spamming!

4438
03:16:05,840 --> 03:16:07,060
Oh my god.

4439
03:16:07,360 --> 03:16:09,900
Bro, am I playing Street Fighter?!

4440
03:16:11,940 --> 03:16:16,660
Bro, wait for it to get close.

4441
03:16:16,880 --> 03:16:17,320
Fuck this.

4442
03:16:20,320 --> 03:16:22,520
I... What do I do?!

4443
03:16:22,520 --> 03:16:27,490
I'm getting zoned!

4444
03:16:27,910 --> 03:16:30,170
I'm actually getting zoned right now!

4445
03:16:32,890 --> 03:16:34,150
I'm getting zoned!

4446
03:16:34,150 --> 03:16:35,470
Zoned so hard!

4447
03:16:53,060 --> 03:16:54,920
Is this a new truck?

4448
03:17:00,430 --> 03:17:04,450
I'm trying to fight... I swear to god, I am trying my best to fight back.

4449
03:17:05,190 --> 03:17:08,010
Bro, she's literally like...

4450
03:17:11,400 --> 03:17:14,560
She's like... Pepper!

4451
03:17:15,240 --> 03:17:15,580
Pepper!

4452
03:17:16,440 --> 03:17:17,560
Salted Pepper!

4453
03:17:23,980 --> 03:17:24,980
Oh my god.

4454
03:17:24,980 --> 03:17:26,980
Now she doesn't zone!

4455
03:17:27,580 --> 03:17:28,520
Okay, bitch!

4456
03:17:30,620 --> 03:17:36,960
Like... Oh my god!

4457
03:17:37,260 --> 03:17:38,080
It's... It's the sword.

4458
03:17:38,300 --> 03:17:40,820
She only zones me when I'm on the sword, apparently.

4459
03:17:42,560 --> 03:17:43,220
Nope!

4460
03:17:43,620 --> 03:17:44,000
JK!

4461
03:17:45,560 --> 03:17:46,220
JK!

4462
03:17:47,520 --> 03:17:48,160
Shit!

4463
03:17:52,840 --> 03:17:54,100
Oh my god!

4464
03:17:54,400 --> 03:17:56,800
Oh my god, he's such a bitch!

4465
03:17:57,380 --> 03:17:58,840
He's such a bitch!

4466
03:17:59,560 --> 03:18:00,500
He's such a bitch!

4467
03:18:00,500 --> 03:18:01,260
She's actually such a bitch!

4468
03:18:01,380 --> 03:18:02,900
How do I... I...

4469
03:18:09,070 --> 03:18:23,950
I...

4470
03:18:29,860 --> 03:18:31,080
Oh my god.

4471
03:18:31,300 --> 03:18:32,640
I swear to god.

4472
03:18:32,880 --> 03:18:37,100
I... I'm gonna... I'm gonna freak out.

4473
03:18:52,700 --> 03:18:53,840
What the fuck?

4474
03:18:54,740 --> 03:18:57,340
What... Oh my god!

4475
03:18:57,800 --> 03:18:58,360
Okay.

4476
03:18:59,000 --> 03:19:00,500
Okay, we gotta get meds.

4477
03:19:01,880 --> 03:19:03,080
I'll use the medicine.

4478
03:19:04,640 --> 03:19:07,860
Wait, can I actually break the... Oh my god, I can't.

4479
03:19:08,180 --> 03:19:10,780
Oh my god, she does so much fucking damage.

4480
03:19:10,800 --> 03:19:14,940
It's actually... I don't know if it's worth it though.

4481
03:19:15,620 --> 03:19:16,580
No, it's not.

4482
03:19:20,020 --> 03:19:21,420
She's so strong.

4483
03:19:24,020 --> 03:19:26,680
I don't have a lot of medicine left.

4484
03:19:28,460 --> 03:19:29,780
What the fuck?

4485
03:19:37,660 --> 03:19:39,440
Okay, it's just like that.

4486
03:19:40,300 --> 03:19:41,160
Oh my god.

4487
03:19:41,420 --> 03:19:43,120
Please, please let me have this at least.

4488
03:19:45,520 --> 03:19:46,520
Oh my...

4489
03:19:47,740 --> 03:19:48,240
Okay.

4490
03:19:53,030 --> 03:19:54,430
Okay.

4491
03:19:59,700 --> 03:20:01,100
Okay.

4492
03:20:01,100 --> 03:20:01,100
Oh.

4493
03:20:01,720 --> 03:20:02,540
Oh!

4494
03:20:17,880 --> 03:20:19,280
Okay.

4495
03:20:19,600 --> 03:20:21,180
I just have to do that.

4496
03:20:21,880 --> 03:20:26,480
And then... Okay.

4497
03:20:27,560 --> 03:20:28,580
Okay.

4498
03:20:28,580 --> 03:20:28,600
Okay.

4499
03:20:31,520 --> 03:20:32,080
All right.

4500
03:20:32,220 --> 03:20:33,260
I got... I got the pattern.

4501
03:20:35,540 --> 03:20:36,540
Oh, I don't.

4502
03:20:36,700 --> 03:20:37,020
JK.

4503
03:20:41,550 --> 03:20:43,170
JK, I don't have the pattern.

4504
03:20:50,440 --> 03:20:51,040
All right.

4505
03:20:51,620 --> 03:20:52,520
Oh, fuck.

4506
03:20:52,780 --> 03:20:53,540
Okay, that's bad.

4507
03:20:53,720 --> 03:20:54,960
I only have one more heal.

4508
03:20:56,040 --> 03:20:57,680
This is my last heal, guys.

4509
03:21:03,900 --> 03:21:04,700
Oh, no.

4510
03:21:05,540 --> 03:21:06,380
Oh, no.

4511
03:21:06,540 --> 03:21:06,560
Oh, no.

4512
03:21:06,560 --> 03:21:10,140
If I miss one shot, it's like...

4513
03:21:10,980 --> 03:21:11,540
Oh!

4514
03:21:12,040 --> 03:21:12,460
Oh!

4515
03:21:17,770 --> 03:21:18,330
Oh!

4516
03:21:18,330 --> 03:21:18,630
Oh, no.

4517
03:21:19,050 --> 03:21:20,150
It's... beautiful.

4518
03:21:21,210 --> 03:21:23,030
The beautiful man himself.

4519
03:21:24,790 --> 03:21:28,110
I use so much... Guys, I'm fucked right now.

4520
03:21:28,330 --> 03:21:28,890
Later on.

4521
03:21:28,990 --> 03:21:30,290
When I don't have meds.

4522
03:21:30,390 --> 03:21:33,010
I'm... I'm... Oh, this is gonna be bad.

4523
03:21:39,650 --> 03:21:40,770
We did it.

4524
03:21:40,890 --> 03:21:43,750
But at one cost, thank all my meds.

4525
03:21:43,950 --> 03:21:46,570
All my fucking meds!

4526
03:21:47,210 --> 03:21:52,490
At least I got the other gem.

4527
03:21:53,910 --> 03:21:55,570
I got the honest yore.

4528
03:21:57,350 --> 03:21:58,010
Nice.

4529
03:21:58,010 --> 03:21:58,210
Yes.

4530
03:22:06,290 --> 03:22:06,850
Alright.

4531
03:22:07,410 --> 03:22:09,650
Yeah, I definitely need a level up armor now.

4532
03:22:13,590 --> 03:22:14,150
Yes.

4533
03:22:18,550 --> 03:22:20,430
Yeah, I wish I could take their umbrella.

4534
03:22:23,070 --> 03:22:25,050
Just trying to make sure there's nothing I'm missing.

4535
03:22:29,250 --> 03:22:30,110
Herb time!

4536
03:22:30,990 --> 03:22:31,530
Oh!

4537
03:22:33,450 --> 03:22:34,350
Wait, what?

4538
03:22:38,920 --> 03:22:39,480
Wait.

4539
03:22:47,270 --> 03:22:47,790
Wait.

4540
03:22:47,790 --> 03:22:48,310
Wait.

4541
03:22:48,810 --> 03:22:49,910
Wait a minute.

4542
03:22:50,690 --> 03:22:51,250
Oh, thank God.

4543
03:22:51,450 --> 03:22:53,190
Okay, I thought I was gonna... Oh, thank God.

4544
03:22:54,710 --> 03:22:59,070
I thought... I was like, after all that, this would be how I'd die.

4545
03:22:59,270 --> 03:23:03,490
I was gonna say, I... I would be so sad if that's how I was gonna die.

4546
03:23:05,110 --> 03:23:07,030
After everything I've been through.

4547
03:23:11,780 --> 03:23:13,760
Where the fuck am I now?

4548
03:23:13,760 --> 03:23:13,840
Oh!

4549
03:23:15,420 --> 03:23:16,600
Okay, secret medicine.

4550
03:23:16,600 --> 03:23:17,440
I need that.

4551
03:23:20,380 --> 03:23:27,100
Somewhere in the ocean lies a solitary island wrapped in dense fog known as Onigashima, the hidden fortress of the Oni clan.

4552
03:23:27,460 --> 03:23:36,680
One day, the demons, fearing that the relationship between the Oni clan and the Yagyu clan would become too strong, attacked the Oni clan and finally located Onigashima.

4553
03:23:36,680 --> 03:23:43,880
A young demon swordsman and three evil soldiers ventured into Onigashima and wiped out the entire Oni clan.

4554
03:23:44,280 --> 03:23:48,040
After that, the demons remodeled Onigashima and put it to their own use.

4555
03:23:48,240 --> 03:23:52,820
As it's surrounded by violent waves and storms, no one can reach the island by ship.

4556
03:23:53,260 --> 03:23:56,960
However, there was a vehicle that the Oni clan would ride to cross the seed.

4557
03:23:57,180 --> 03:24:04,520
Before the Oni were defeated, a prophet predicted that, a hundred years from now, a hero of Oni origin will come to Onigashima to reclaim it.

4558
03:24:04,520 --> 03:24:05,060
That's me!

4559
03:24:06,540 --> 03:24:07,820
I'm in the prophecy!

4560
03:24:09,020 --> 03:24:10,480
That is unfamous.

4561
03:24:11,600 --> 03:24:12,380
That's me.

4562
03:24:12,960 --> 03:24:14,280
I'm so famous.

4563
03:24:14,700 --> 03:24:15,880
Wait, this is a short game.

4564
03:24:16,040 --> 03:24:17,320
I almost have two more orbs.

4565
03:24:19,760 --> 03:24:20,280
Alright.

4566
03:24:23,610 --> 03:24:25,970
There's a round hole with the word honesty on it.

4567
03:24:26,370 --> 03:24:26,630
Alright.

4568
03:24:28,810 --> 03:24:29,730
Oh my god.

4569
03:24:29,890 --> 03:24:31,930
Now I have a fucking jet ski?

4570
03:24:32,450 --> 03:24:32,970
Like...

4571
03:24:35,870 --> 03:24:37,670
Look at my jet ski.

4572
03:24:37,970 --> 03:24:39,290
All I'm saying.

4573
03:24:39,610 --> 03:24:41,410
Fuck the Oni clan.

4574
03:24:41,770 --> 03:24:43,290
We could have had this.

4575
03:24:54,590 --> 03:24:55,310
Wee!

4576
03:25:00,040 --> 03:25:02,500
We have a submarine jet ski.

4577
03:25:04,240 --> 03:25:06,300
Wait, are you saying I could have had armor?

4578
03:25:08,660 --> 03:25:11,120
Do I get to go back to her?

4579
03:25:18,340 --> 03:25:20,320
Do you know who he reminds me of?

4580
03:25:22,160 --> 03:25:22,880
The...

4581
03:25:22,880 --> 03:25:25,580
The Aquaman guy in Rick and Morty.

4582
03:25:31,110 --> 03:25:33,390
Your eyes betray you.

4583
03:25:34,350 --> 03:25:40,890
Your eyes reveal that you are thrilled to encounter a man who is stronger than you.

4584
03:25:41,910 --> 03:25:42,390
Whatever.

4585
03:25:42,390 --> 03:25:44,030
Mr. Nimbus, yeah.

4586
03:25:44,330 --> 03:25:46,850
He looks just like Mr. Nimbus.

4587
03:25:55,210 --> 03:25:55,810
So,

4588
03:25:59,770 --> 03:26:00,070
let's get started.

4589
03:26:00,070 --> 03:26:00,210
What?

4590
03:26:01,070 --> 03:26:01,510
Bro!

4591
03:26:03,070 --> 03:26:03,510
What?

4592
03:26:04,870 --> 03:26:05,310
What?

4593
03:26:05,530 --> 03:26:06,990
He breaks through guard?

4594
03:26:12,920 --> 03:26:13,680
Oh my...

4595
03:26:13,680 --> 03:26:14,720
This better be scripted.

4596
03:26:19,670 --> 03:26:21,430
Bro, this better be scripted.

4597
03:26:21,570 --> 03:26:23,410
Like, what the fuck do you want me to do?

4598
03:26:28,440 --> 03:26:29,340
Oh my god.

4599
03:26:31,100 --> 03:26:31,540
Just...

4600
03:26:32,820 --> 03:26:34,000
This better be scripted.

4601
03:26:34,000 --> 03:26:34,640
Oh my god.

4602
03:26:35,860 --> 03:26:37,380
I swear to god.

4603
03:26:40,500 --> 03:26:42,960
If this is not scripted...

4604
03:26:43,960 --> 03:26:45,080
Oh my god.

4605
03:26:45,260 --> 03:26:46,160
I swear to god.

4606
03:26:49,020 --> 03:26:50,320
Oh thank god.

4607
03:26:50,480 --> 03:26:50,780
Okay.

4608
03:26:51,080 --> 03:26:51,460
Okay.

4609
03:26:51,880 --> 03:26:52,000
Okay.

4610
03:26:52,200 --> 03:26:52,560
That's...

4611
03:26:52,560 --> 03:26:53,420
That's fine.

4612
03:26:53,740 --> 03:26:55,400
That's That's more than fine.

4613
03:26:56,500 --> 03:26:58,160
That's more than fine.

4614
03:26:58,160 --> 03:26:59,700
Alright, that's more hidden.

4615
03:27:00,340 --> 03:27:01,840
That's more hidden.

4616
03:27:02,100 --> 03:27:02,240
Fine.

4617
03:27:05,600 --> 03:27:06,240
Alright.

4618
03:27:13,480 --> 03:27:15,420
I forgot about the armor again.

4619
03:27:15,900 --> 03:27:26,320
I... Wait, how do you get the armor?

4620
03:27:30,720 --> 03:27:32,740
Wait, how do you get the armor though?

4621
03:27:44,660 --> 03:27:46,220
Wait, how do you get the armor?

4622
03:27:50,980 --> 03:27:53,240
Cause I can't... I don't think I can upgrade the armor in time.

4623
03:27:54,200 --> 03:27:54,600
Oh!

4624
03:28:00,520 --> 03:28:03,920
Oh, I thought you meant like, there's an armor I can find.

4625
03:28:07,060 --> 03:28:07,800
There's no way.

4626
03:28:07,900 --> 03:28:09,360
I don't think I can... Oh my god.

4627
03:28:10,400 --> 03:28:15,660
I don't think I can like, find... Like, the issue is that I don't think I can like, uh...

4628
03:28:16,400 --> 03:28:18,420
I don't... I don't have enough to upgrade it.

4629
03:28:18,520 --> 03:28:19,100
I'm pretty sure.

4630
03:28:22,600 --> 03:28:23,300
Jesus Christ!

4631
03:28:23,380 --> 03:28:24,460
I can't even use magic!

4632
03:28:33,210 --> 03:28:34,010
Oh my god.

4633
03:28:36,710 --> 03:28:37,930
Oh my god.

4634
03:28:38,630 --> 03:28:39,290
I'm trying...

4635
03:28:40,810 --> 03:28:41,210
Oh.

4636
03:28:44,770 --> 03:28:47,210
Bro, he's just... He's just styling.

4637
03:28:47,750 --> 03:28:48,530
Like, I don't know.

4638
03:28:48,870 --> 03:28:49,610
I don't know.

4639
03:28:49,690 --> 03:28:50,690
He's just so fancy.

4640
03:28:50,690 --> 03:28:52,110
Like, he's just...

4641
03:28:52,730 --> 03:28:54,890
He's just dancing around my body.

4642
03:28:54,890 --> 03:28:55,930
Like, at this point.

4643
03:28:57,950 --> 03:28:59,650
Look at him go.

4644
03:29:00,190 --> 03:29:02,070
Look at him go.

4645
03:29:02,430 --> 03:29:04,170
He's... He's so fancy.

4646
03:29:05,410 --> 03:29:06,530
Look at him go.

4647
03:29:07,690 --> 03:29:09,590
He's like, that's cute buddy.

4648
03:29:10,350 --> 03:29:11,490
That's so cute.

4649
03:29:11,810 --> 03:29:12,310
That's...

4650
03:29:12,310 --> 03:29:13,370
You're right.

4651
03:29:13,510 --> 03:29:15,450
Let me just shoot my bow and arrow.

4652
03:29:15,450 --> 03:29:15,510
Look at him go.

4653
03:29:18,850 --> 03:29:19,370
What?

4654
03:29:24,700 --> 03:29:25,780
Oh my god.

4655
03:29:26,040 --> 03:29:26,880
Oh my god.

4656
03:29:27,100 --> 03:29:27,360
Okay.

4657
03:29:27,940 --> 03:29:29,020
Oh my god.

4658
03:29:29,120 --> 03:29:29,120
Okay.

4659
03:29:34,240 --> 03:29:35,280
Yeah, I...

4660
03:29:35,280 --> 03:29:36,960
I don't know, guys.

4661
03:29:38,060 --> 03:29:39,160
Oh, I did it!

4662
03:29:42,840 --> 03:29:43,980
Scripted loss!

4663
03:29:44,340 --> 03:29:44,780
Let's go!

4664
03:29:49,740 --> 03:29:51,860
My scripted loss.

4665
03:29:52,860 --> 03:29:53,640
Great.

4666
03:29:54,640 --> 03:29:57,640
How shameful to be saved by her twice.

4667
03:29:58,960 --> 03:29:59,740
Well...

4668
03:29:59,740 --> 03:30:01,660
I guess you can't help it.

4669
03:30:02,000 --> 03:30:02,300
So...

4670
03:30:02,300 --> 03:30:03,900
Let's postpone...

4671
03:30:03,900 --> 03:30:05,200
This game for now.

4672
03:30:05,580 --> 03:30:06,980
Oh, he's like playing with me.

4673
03:30:07,220 --> 03:30:07,800
He's like...

4674
03:30:07,800 --> 03:30:08,440
Goodbye.

4675
03:30:09,320 --> 03:30:09,920
But...

4676
03:30:09,920 --> 03:30:11,860
Maybe we can begin a new game.

4677
03:30:12,280 --> 03:30:15,140
Lord Nobunaga is going to attack Odani Castle.

4678
03:30:15,820 --> 03:30:16,140
Huh?

4679
03:30:16,660 --> 03:30:17,200
What?

4680
03:30:19,480 --> 03:30:22,520
It is only a matter of time before Odani Castle falls.

4681
03:30:22,520 --> 03:30:23,680
Oh, thanks for telling me!

4682
03:30:23,940 --> 03:30:24,840
What will you do?

4683
03:30:24,840 --> 03:30:26,320
You're like...

4684
03:30:26,360 --> 03:30:27,360
What the fuck?

4685
03:30:27,600 --> 03:30:28,600
This is so campy.

4686
03:30:29,060 --> 03:30:29,900
Like...

4687
03:30:30,600 --> 03:30:32,040
Why is he...

4688
03:30:33,580 --> 03:30:35,480
What kind of boat is that?

4689
03:30:37,760 --> 03:30:39,920
He goes in his...

4690
03:30:39,920 --> 03:30:41,600
In his mechanical boat.

4691
03:30:42,740 --> 03:30:43,980
What the fuck?

4692
03:30:44,900 --> 03:30:46,300
There's Mr. Nimbus.

4693
03:30:54,080 --> 03:30:54,580
His...

4694
03:30:54,580 --> 03:30:56,520
The future motorboat.

4695
03:31:03,540 --> 03:31:05,540
He controls the police.

4696
03:31:17,400 --> 03:31:20,400
Well, that could've been our mechanical boat.

4697
03:31:20,520 --> 03:31:21,580
If the fucking...

4698
03:31:21,580 --> 03:31:21,860
Oni...

4699
03:31:21,860 --> 03:31:24,600
Oni clan didn't fuck this up for us.

4700
03:31:30,640 --> 03:31:32,760
We could've all had these boats.

4701
03:31:36,350 --> 03:31:36,930
Oh!

4702
03:31:37,050 --> 03:31:37,130
Oh!

4703
03:31:37,150 --> 03:31:38,290
There's my dead mom.

4704
03:31:42,660 --> 03:31:44,120
How can this be?

4705
03:31:50,400 --> 03:31:53,780
I'd like to express my thanks to you.

4706
03:31:54,360 --> 03:31:55,800
For saving my son.

4707
03:31:58,240 --> 03:32:00,180
I have a favor.

4708
03:32:00,560 --> 03:32:01,980
Marry my son.

4709
03:32:01,980 --> 03:32:03,640
I'll just get you my son.

4710
03:32:03,640 --> 03:32:03,960
I'll give it to Jube.

4711
03:32:03,960 --> 03:32:05,700
And give it to Jube.

4712
03:32:06,560 --> 03:32:07,800
Sacred flute?

4713
03:32:11,500 --> 03:32:15,540
It is a secret instrument handed down in our own land.

4714
03:32:15,540 --> 03:32:17,140
I give you my son.

4715
03:32:17,700 --> 03:32:21,960
For the instrument, he's gonna compete with that demon swordsman.

4716
03:32:22,800 --> 03:32:24,960
Find the sacred flute.

4717
03:32:24,960 --> 03:32:25,620
Loot.

4718
03:32:27,480 --> 03:32:30,300
Then, I will find it for Jubei.

4719
03:32:33,020 --> 03:32:34,960
I'm glad to hear that.

4720
03:32:36,240 --> 03:32:37,000
Thank you.

4721
03:32:38,240 --> 03:32:39,200
Oy you.

4722
03:32:42,980 --> 03:32:44,180
Goodbye now.

4723
03:32:45,000 --> 03:32:45,600
Goodbye.

4724
03:32:49,640 --> 03:32:52,280
Alright, I got the red sole bracelet.

4725
03:32:53,580 --> 03:32:56,000
Alright, let's save- we're gonna call it here.

4726
03:32:57,280 --> 03:32:58,880
We're gonna call it here, sorry.

4727
03:32:59,860 --> 03:33:01,740
I'll finish- I don't think I can finish it.

4728
03:33:01,880 --> 03:33:04,960
I know I'll- personally, I don't think I can do one shot this.

4729
03:33:05,220 --> 03:33:08,000
I- I'm getting tired.

4730
03:33:08,300 --> 03:33:09,980
So, we'll finish it next time.

4731
03:33:10,660 --> 03:33:15,240
Also, cuz like, I know she's weak as fuck, so I don't really wanna play as her right now.

4732
03:33:15,400 --> 03:33:22,160
I- I think I'm- I'm like halfway there, right?

4733
03:33:22,980 --> 03:33:24,240
Am I halfway there?

4734
03:33:24,860 --> 03:33:25,260
Guys?

4735
03:33:27,540 --> 03:33:31,700
I did like a three-hour members- almost a three-hour members stream this morning, too.

4736
03:33:31,880 --> 03:33:33,440
So I was like, oh, I should rest up a little.

4737
03:33:33,940 --> 03:33:35,220
Uh, yeah?

4738
03:33:35,540 --> 03:33:35,760
Okay.

4739
03:33:36,040 --> 03:33:36,440
So, yeah.

4740
03:33:36,580 --> 03:33:37,680
I can finish it next time.

4741
03:33:38,020 --> 03:33:38,780
That was really fun!

4742
03:33:38,940 --> 03:33:41,260
I had a really fun playing, um...

4743
03:33:43,140 --> 03:33:43,500
Um...

4744
03:33:43,500 --> 03:33:45,100
Sorry, my brain like blanked out.

4745
03:33:45,300 --> 03:33:45,520
Ha!

4746
03:33:46,020 --> 03:33:46,460
Onimusha!

4747
03:33:46,760 --> 03:33:48,400
I had a really fun time playing Onimusha!

4748
03:33:49,100 --> 03:33:49,540
Um...

4749
03:33:49,540 --> 03:33:50,940
But yeah, thank you everybody for coming!

4750
03:33:51,320 --> 03:33:54,620
Uh, tomorrow, there is a very special announcement on Twitter at 12pm.

4751
03:33:54,900 --> 03:33:55,820
So, yeah!

4752
03:33:55,960 --> 03:33:56,920
Look forward to that!

4753
03:33:57,500 --> 03:33:57,940
Um...

4754
03:33:57,940 --> 03:34:00,380
But I had a great time with you guys today.

4755
03:34:00,800 --> 03:34:02,980
Uh, it was really fun going back through memory lane.

4756
03:34:03,260 --> 03:34:04,220
Um, and everything.

4757
03:34:04,220 --> 03:34:07,480
I got beat up really hard today in Onimusha.

4758
03:34:07,980 --> 03:34:08,500
Um...

4759
03:34:08,500 --> 03:34:08,500
Ha!

4760
03:34:08,540 --> 03:34:08,920
Ha!

4761
03:34:09,120 --> 03:34:09,120
Ha!

4762
03:34:09,360 --> 03:34:09,360
Ha!

4763
03:34:09,660 --> 03:34:09,780
Ha!

4764
03:34:09,980 --> 03:34:10,200
Ha!

4765
03:34:10,200 --> 03:34:10,220
Ha!

4766
03:34:10,320 --> 03:34:10,380
Ha!

4767
03:34:10,380 --> 03:34:10,420
Ha!

4768
03:34:10,800 --> 03:34:13,100
Yeah, but it's been a really fun play through so far.

4769
03:34:13,500 --> 03:34:16,520
I'm really looking- I feel like they made it more silly.

4770
03:34:16,880 --> 03:34:20,660
I- They definitely made it a lot more silly in 2 compared to 1.

4771
03:34:20,880 --> 03:34:26,560
Cause 1 did not have all this magical mechanical shit going around.

4772
03:34:27,580 --> 03:34:28,020
Ha!

4773
03:34:28,020 --> 03:34:28,100
Ha!

4774
03:34:28,100 --> 03:34:28,220
Ha!

4775
03:34:28,220 --> 03:34:28,300
Ha!

4776
03:34:28,300 --> 03:34:28,380
Ha!

4777
03:34:28,380 --> 03:34:32,180
2 is definitely a lot sillier than 1.

4778
03:34:32,600 --> 03:34:33,440
Anyway, guys.

4779
03:34:34,340 --> 03:34:34,740
Um...

4780
03:34:34,740 --> 03:34:35,560
I'm gonna head off now.

4781
03:34:35,720 --> 03:34:37,580
I hope you guys had a fun time hanging out with me today.

4782
03:34:37,900 --> 03:34:40,160
Yeah, the robot horse was- Was crazy.

4783
03:34:40,340 --> 03:34:43,040
I was- I forgot about the robot horse.

4784
03:34:44,160 --> 03:34:44,560
Um...

4785
03:34:44,560 --> 03:34:45,240
Anyway, guys.

4786
03:34:45,280 --> 03:34:46,160
As always, everybody.

4787
03:34:46,600 --> 03:34:47,480
Stay hydrated.

4788
03:34:47,740 --> 03:34:48,280
Posture check.

4789
03:34:48,400 --> 03:34:50,120
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

4790
03:34:50,240 --> 03:34:52,040
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

4791
03:34:52,140 --> 03:34:52,540
Cause...

4792
03:34:52,540 --> 03:34:53,380
You deserve it.

4793
03:34:53,480 --> 03:34:55,980
Also, I can't believe I made this game harder for me.

4794
03:34:56,040 --> 03:34:57,300
Because I chose Ra.

4795
03:34:57,560 --> 03:34:59,160
I- I wanted to be greedy.

4796
03:34:59,220 --> 03:35:00,300
I was like, oh, there's her.

4797
03:35:00,300 --> 03:35:04,100
But I wanna see who's the other- who's the other lady in the market.

4798
03:35:04,720 --> 03:35:05,660
Oh my god.

4799
03:35:05,980 --> 03:35:08,360
2 women wanting to talk to me!

4800
03:35:08,620 --> 03:35:11,320
And then I lost my chance of getting better armor.

4801
03:35:11,360 --> 03:35:12,160
I'm so sad.

4802
03:35:12,480 --> 03:35:12,480
Ha!

4803
03:35:12,940 --> 03:35:12,940
Ha!

4804
03:35:13,380 --> 03:35:13,380
Ha!

4805
03:35:13,840 --> 03:35:14,060
Ha!

4806
03:35:14,540 --> 03:35:14,540
Ha!

4807
03:35:14,540 --> 03:35:14,540
Ha!

4808
03:35:14,860 --> 03:35:14,860
Ha!

4809
03:35:14,880 --> 03:35:14,880
Ha!

4810
03:35:15,500 --> 03:35:17,480
Anyway guys, I'm gonna head off now.

4811
03:35:17,620 --> 03:35:18,560
I'm gonna stay one more time.

4812
03:35:19,040 --> 03:35:19,480
Uh...

4813
03:35:19,480 --> 03:35:20,800
I'll see you guys later everyone.

4814
03:35:21,080 --> 03:35:21,720
Bye guys!

4815
03:35:22,140 --> 03:35:22,680
Mmm...

4816
03:35:22,680 --> 03:35:22,940
Bye!

4817
03:35:22,940 --> 03:35:23,100
Bye!
