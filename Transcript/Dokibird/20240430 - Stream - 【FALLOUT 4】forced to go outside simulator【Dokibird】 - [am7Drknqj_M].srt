1
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,630
I'm so busy.

2
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:03,450
I didn't start exactly at 5.

3
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,790
But Doki, where's Doki?

4
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:10,130
Every time I don't start exactly at 5.

5
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:11,850
Where's Doki?

6
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,190
Is she napping?

7
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:14,330
Where is she?

8
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,710
Oh my god, she's late.

9
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:22,190
I'm so sorry guys that I started 40 seconds after 5.

10
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,430
Oh my god, what a sin.

11
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,670
How could she?

12
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:32,650
How could Doki do this to us?

13
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:36,610
Starting 40 seconds after 5.

14
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,230
She fucking hates us.

15
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,130
She hates us, dragoons.

16
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,410
Shake my head.

17
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,730
Thank you for the 10 gifted chips.

18
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:51,550
Thank you.

19
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:52,270
Thank you.

20
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:54,890
Betrayed.

21
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,190
How could she?

22
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,210
Oh my god.

23
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:02,190
Anyway guys, I'm sorry I didn't start at exactly at 5.

24
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:13,590
I actually had like my sense of time got in the way because like I was working on like 3 different projects simultaneously.

25
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,150
In the last like hours.

26
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:17,750
It's just like...

27
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:19,490
I was just like...

28
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,730
And I was like, oh f... and I was like, okay, it's 4.50.

29
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:27,050
Surely I can work an additional 9 more minutes before I start stream.

30
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:27,990
I was like...

31
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,550
And I was like, oh sh...

32
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:33,130
I didn't even pull up any of my applications.

33
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:36,570
I didn't boot up the game or anything in the last minute.

34
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,670
Alright, it's 4.59.

35
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,010
I can boot up everything in one minute.

36
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:41,410
Let's go.

37
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:48,910
Oh my god, there's so many things.

38
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:49,990
And I have to pack it.

39
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:53,170
Oh my gosh, yesterday, I've been so busy yesterday.

40
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,710
Okay, so we have 60...

41
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:09,310
Recently, I don't know when I tweeted this, but recently, we received 60 giant packages of like, of debut Doki Bird merch.

42
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,770
So, 60 boxes!

43
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:15,890
There's like barely space in my tiny apartment right now.

44
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:20,170
So like, the lobby people called us and was like, Hey!

45
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,790
We received a lot of packages.

46
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,610
And I was just like, Huh?

47
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,730
And I was like, oh sh...

48
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,710
And it came in with like 30.

49
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:31,350
So like, 30 first.

50
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:32,270
And then...

51
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:35,670
And then like, And then more came...

52
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,370
30 more came.

53
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,390
And I was just like...

54
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:42,330
I was just like, oh my god.

55
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,890
There's 60... I did not...

56
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:44,570
Okay, look.

57
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,270
We were told... I ordered...

58
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,070
We were told it was 60 boxes.

59
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:49,430
And...

60
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,770
I was told it was 60 boxes, but I couldn't comprehend...

61
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,370
how many 60 was.

62
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,230
I couldn't...

63
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,270
I couldn't comprehend...

64
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:06,230
how many 60 boxes actually was.

65
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,210
Because I was like, oh that's not that much, right?

66
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:13,230
Because I lost my sense of like, how many people is alive.

67
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:14,290
So...

68
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:16,290
So I was like...

69
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,610
Oh, 60 is not...

70
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:18,830
that bad.

71
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,350
And then...

72
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,570
Boxes kept coming into my apartment.

73
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,510
More and more...

74
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:27,910
and more.

75
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,150
And I was just like...

76
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:31,170
So I don't have a hallway anymore.

77
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,770
And like, it's so bad...

78
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:35,730
that like...

79
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,930
You know where the...

80
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:40,750
When you walk in the pathway where the boxes are, there's like barely light.

81
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,050
There is...

82
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,490
There is barely any light.

83
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:50,610
When you start walking through the hallway.

84
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:54,630
Because the boxes just tower above you.

85
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:55,970
And uh...

86
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:58,530
So...

87
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:02,530
I've been like slowly packaging them myself.

88
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:03,570
Yesterday.

89
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,970
So I like packaged like two.

90
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:07,470
Yes, okay.

91
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:11,490
I packaged two because I have to organize the inventory and stuff like that.

92
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,470
Um...

93
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:15,410
You guys must be wondering, why are you packaging them yourself?

94
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,690
Good question!

95
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:20,090
Mom, why am I packaging them?

96
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,050
So...

97
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:32,230
Anyway, I'm slowly sorting...

98
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:34,650
sorting it out.

99
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:37,790
With myself at the moment.

100
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:45,030
Anyway, I hope to like...

101
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:50,830
I hope we can start shipping them... shipping them out uh... next week.

102
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:52,410
Well, it's gonna be slowly.

103
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,570
I'm so sorry if it's gonna be like...

104
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:57,950
If there is a delay in the end, I am so sorry.

105
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:58,430
I'll...

106
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:02,770
I'll try to be more transparent about it if there is gonna be a delay going forward.

107
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,330
But I'm trying my best to like...

108
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,650
start uh...

109
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:10,790
to like uh... package them and sending them out.

110
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:14,910
The bundles might take a bit longer uh... to do.

111
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:20,730
Um... because I don't think I ordered enough packaging materials for...

112
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,210
for the bundle.

113
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:27,970
So I've like... I recently ordered more envelopes and stuff like that.

114
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:28,910
Uh...

115
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,410
for the...

116
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:31,610
for all the merch.

117
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:32,910
And...

118
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,730
uh... and...

119
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:38,830
um... but I can start shipping the smaller stuff.

120
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:40,790
Like the people who order the smaller things.

121
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,650
Because I have enough of that.

122
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,430
Of that.

123
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:45,030
But like for the bundles...

124
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:45,490
and stuff.

125
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:48,590
There might... there might be a little delay for the bundles.

126
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,590
Just a little bit.

127
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,430
I hope.

128
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:53,030
But if it does end up being a longer delay...

129
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,750
I'll try to be transparent with you guys.

130
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,350
I'll give you guys updates about it.

131
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:58,910
So time to re... I thought I had a warehouse!

132
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,010
I like gave... okay.

133
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:06,470
Like that's why I was like... I'm gonna start like being more on top of things.

134
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,570
Because I was so busy.

135
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,790
So I delegated some of the stuff.

136
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:10,890
Uh...

137
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,110
to my parents.

138
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,250
Because they said they wanted to work on that for me.

139
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:15,030
And then...

140
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,770
so I thought I had a warehouse.

141
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:20,970
Until I got 60 packages sent to my apartment.

142
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,570
And I was like...

143
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,150
Where's the distributor?

144
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:32,870
I was like...

145
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:37,010
I was like... I thought this was gonna be sent to the distributor.

146
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,470
And then...

147
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,650
And then I was like...

148
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:44,810
So...

149
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,410
So I was like...

150
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,690
I guess I'm the warehouse now.

151
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,250
I don't know what's going on.

152
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:54,030
That's why... I don't know what's going on at the moment.

153
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:56,490
But I don't wanna be like late with orders.

154
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:57,730
Um...

155
00:08:58,650 --> 00:08:59,470
So yeah.

156
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,130
My apartment's the distributor.

157
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,970
My apartment's the warehouse for now.

158
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:08,230
So like I'm trying to be like on top of like... There's a lot of things going on.

159
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:12,630
So like I'm trying to be like super on top... Not on top.

160
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:13,050
Like okay.

161
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:17,630
I can't say I'm on top of everything when my apartment is literally the warehouse right now.

162
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:27,630
But... It's been pretty rough because like... I'm doing like hundreds of jobs at once every day.

163
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:37,490
And I'm hoping that next week when I have my actual break break that like everything is...

164
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:42,550
Everything is like I guess like settled.

165
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,530
Or like finally organized.

166
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:45,970
Um...

167
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:49,450
And like I'm actually looking... I'm currently also... Okay.

168
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:50,750
I'm like doing so many things.

169
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:55,130
I'm actually currently looking for a place for myself.

170
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:56,850
Like to live on my own.

171
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,750
Technically like I used to live on my own.

172
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:03,370
And then like... And then my parents started living with me.

173
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,430
I pay for the rent and everything by the way.

174
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:08,930
So it's not like you know I'm living like at my parents place.

175
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,070
My parents are living with me.

176
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,630
Um... But like I'm to like...

177
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:15,630
Starting yesterday I've been like actually looking for a place for myself.

178
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,310
To be more like um...

179
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:18,910
Independent.

180
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:23,110
And then I guess like use my other... This apartment as a warehouse I guess.

181
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:24,030
Because...

182
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:24,950
.

183
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:24,970
.

184
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:32,830
And like I will have to pay like two rents.

185
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:38,850
But that's okay because I'm thankful for you Dragoons for like supporting me.

186
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:44,270
So that I can afford to pay technically like if I when I do get my new place.

187
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,850
I'll be paying for two rents.

188
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,670
I'm not buying a place because like in...

189
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:52,610
Despite the amount of support you guys have given me.

190
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,850
Like the housing...

191
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:55,910
The house...

192
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:57,870
The real estate...

193
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:01,870
The real estate market in Canada is fucking terrible.

194
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:02,930
So...

195
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:06,350
So...

196
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:09,130
So despite... Yeah in this economy.

197
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:11,210
Like you guys support me so much.

198
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:12,370
But like...

199
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:18,410
In this economy and the housing market like I'm not gonna be buying a place anytime soon.

200
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:21,990
Next...

201

Thank you.

206
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:27,850
Thank you for the super chat.

207
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:28,290
Thank you.

208
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:29,050
Thank you.

209
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:29,650
Fiction.

210
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:30,570
Thank you for the super chat.

211
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:30,870
Thank you.

212
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:31,350
Thank you.

213
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:35,210
Thanks for playing the game that the most amount hours played in my entire library.

214
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:36,710
Weighing over 2000.

215
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:38,810
Okay to be fair that's never...

216
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:40,470
That's not as much as my dad.

217
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,450
He's been playing this game for like two...

218
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:45,350
For like two to three years non-stop every day.

219
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:46,850
So like since it got launched.

220
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,330
Sometimes he goes back to it.

221
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:49,570
Like ever so often.

222
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:54,350
So like the intro of Fallout 4 is like fucking ingrained in my head.

223
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:56,870
Because I've seen him replay the intro.

224
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,930
He created numerous characters.

225
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:00,330
Um...

226
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:01,850
Multiple times.

227
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:04,650
I feel like every time I see him play Fallout 4 it's a new character.

228
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:07,410
So like I fucking know the intro by heart.

229
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:08,090
Like...

230
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,010
Thank you for the super chat.

231
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:11,350
Thank you.

232
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:11,930
Thank you.

233
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:12,630
Um...

234
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,330
Media thank you for the super chat.

235
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:14,630
Thank you.

236
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,210
Thank you.

237
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:18,710
Would say this to the Doki House but yeah the housing market.

238
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:19,530
Thank you for the super chat.

239
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:19,970
Thank you.

240
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:21,810
Um...

241
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:24,490
But yeah I am really...

242
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:25,570
I... Oh my gosh.

243
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,130
I haven't like looked for my own place for so long.

244
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,230
I think for like...

245
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:34,630
I think like for a very long time since I guess like since you know...

246
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,590
Since like... Oh my gosh.

247
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:37,070
I don't remember.

248
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:41,030
I have like usually like um...

249
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,370
I don't have to look for myself.

250
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:53,790
Uh... But like I don't even know if... I hope like... I hope like my future landlords if I see a place and I don't have to compete with like 50 other people.

251
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:57,950
Like I'm pretty sure I'm gonna have to compete with 50 plus other people.

252
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:04,770
And then like I... I feel like if they find out I have a dog they'll be like no.

253
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:11,010
The hardest part is finding a pet friendly... um...

254
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,790
apartment to rent as well.

255
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:20,970
And that's like the hardest part because usually landlords would be like no pet the bet... like the better... the bet...

256
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:25,490
the bet... the better you are as in like you know pets quiet.

257
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:26,710
Uh...

258
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:31,410
Ha ha ha ha ha ha Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha Good credit.

259
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:32,230
Uh...

260
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:33,750
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

261
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,410
No noise complaints.

262
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:36,310
Oh fuck.

263
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:39,130
I need to find a place that has like... that has good...

264
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:41,330
That has thick walls.

265
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:48,790
I... I know that like some places they'll be like um... if you...

266
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:52,550
they'll have like 50 plus uh... people... applicants.

267
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,110
They'll have 50 plus applicants.

268
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:59,310
And then... and then they'll choose the one with zero... no pets.

269
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:00,450
Uh...

270
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:10,350
Not uni... I guess like sometimes they prefer university students because they are like university students that study and like know they won't party or anything.

271
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,010
Because like that was me.

272
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:18,630
I remember like as a university student I... I was like the go to class... like the go to applicant.

273
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:20,450
I was basically the dream applicant.

274
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:23,490
The dream tenant for so many landlords.

275
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:30,110
Like every time I applied for like a place because at that time I didn't have like Doki Amber Doge.

276
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:33,890
So like they'll be like oh my god she has no pets.

277
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,690
She's by herself.

278
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:36,790
She's alone.

279
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:45,110
Uh... Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha She obviously only studies like look at her.

280
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:46,790
She doesn't party.

281
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:55,670
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha And she's just... she's...

282
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:59,050
She seems like a... like a good person.

283
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:06,590
Ha ha ha ha ha ha Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha So every time... I remember in the past I would apply for a place.

284
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,990
I would be like... I instantly get it.

285
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:11,590
Like I don't think I've ever been rejected for a place.

286
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:15,310
Just because in university I was like a university student.

287
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:19,030
But like I had like all the good traits of a university student.

288
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:23,330
Like and like I was able to afford um...

289
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,730
like a decent place.

290
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,450
I guess like quote on quote decent place.

291
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:33,270
Ha ha ha ha ha ha Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha For like a single person.

292
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,630
So like... so then they'll like oh...

293
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:38,710
And by the... back then I didn't stream as well.

294
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:41,030
So there was zero noise complaints.

295
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:45,330
I... I also did not stream.

296
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:47,990
So I had zero noise complaints.

297
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:49,550
So they're like jeez perfect.

298
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:55,370
I remember one time I like tried to I actually like I was actually looking at several places.

299
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:59,850
And had several landlords trying to compete for me as a tenant.

300
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:01,970
It's that... it's that fucking crazy.

301
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:07,270
Ha ha ha ha ha ha Like what was like um... was like a basement... like what was it called?

302
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:08,050
Like a basement suite?

303
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:13,790
So like there was a family that was living... you know the family was renting out their... their basement suite.

304
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:14,990
And the other one was an apartment.

305
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:16,890
And um...

306
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:21,890
And then like obviously I'm sorry to the family...

307
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,830
to the family in the...

308
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:27,030
I'm sorry to the family in the basement suite.

309
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:33,610
But I rejected the basement suite because like obvi... like there was a... they had a little baby.

310
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:39,630
So... Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha Ha ha ha ha ha ha They...

311
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:42,370
They had... they had a...

312
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:43,730
They had a baby.

313
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:45,190
And I was like Oh no.

314
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:48,730
Will I be considered like a free babysitter for them in the future?

315
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:49,610
Like...

316
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:54,830
Ha ha ha ha ha They were in like the suburbia.

317
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,110
They were in suburbia too.

318
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:57,370
So I was just like oh no.

319
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58,970
I have to walk to the bus stop.

320
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:00,730
Instead of like going...

321
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:03,670
Like I have to walk several blocks to get to the bus stop.

322
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,750
To like get to my university.

323
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:11,470
But like you know the other one the bus stop was like you know it was at an apartment at a decent place.

324
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:18,890
So it was like I just have to walk like maybe like three minutes to the bus stop to get to my university.

325
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,090
So I was like No I'm sorry.

326
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:25,190
But then like the app... the landlord for the basement suite.

327
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:36,610
They like sent me like several emails to convince me... Ha ha ha ha Ha ha ha ha ha They sent me like several emails to like...

328
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:42,890
convince me to choose them as like their like to choose them to rent.

329
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:45,210
They're like we think you're the perfect tenant.

330
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,590
Like how's the application going?

331
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:51,450
Cause like they're like oh we need... like it's just like it's the rules.

332
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:54,150
You need to fill out this application and stuff like that.

333
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:59,390
And they sent me like two emails two to three emails being like Oh what do you think?

334
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:01,930
Like we really think you're the perfect tenant for us.

335
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:04,010
Like we really want you to rent our place.

336
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:07,410
Like oh how's the application going on?

337
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:08,430
I felt so sad.

338
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,590
Cause I was like oh I'm sorry.

339
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:13,190
I found another place that like suits me better.

340
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:19,930
Even the apartment tenant also was like Oh we think you're the perfect tenant.

341
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:33,990
Like I literally just did like one I just went to one um I went to like one like you know where you have to like look around the apartment and then just like talk like just talk to them and just be like...

342
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:35,530
what your thoughts are and stuff.

343
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:39,970
And after that they'll be like after that they'll be like oh I think you're perfect.

344
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:53,310
Like I think we will I think like the apartment guy was like right after the interview and like looking around the apartment they were like oh yeah we think we want you to be the tenant.

345
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:54,670
Like the open house.

346
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:55,450
Yeah yeah yeah.

347
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:56,310
The open house.

348
00:18:56,530 --> 00:19:03,090
Cause like they were like right after the open house they were like oh yeah yeah we want you to be our tenant.

349
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:06,930
Like yeah we're not we're not gonna look at the other other applicants anymore.

350
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:09,530
And I was like oh okay yeah I think this is a good place.

351
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:13,410
Make them...

352
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:14,250
Make them...

353
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,190
It's gonna make them fight.

354
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:33,170
I think it's also cause like I've... you know how... okay so um I'm like the ideal tenant because like the reason why I'm the ideal tenant is because like I write my checks in advance.

355
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:42,030
So basically like I just give them like 6 months of checks in advance and be like so I don't have to keep up with it.

356
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:42,490
You know?

357
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:52,450
So I don't I don't So I just be like okay like you don't have to chase me for rent.

358
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:59,210
I was just like I pays on time.

359
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,450
Doesn't party.

360
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:03,530
Like just didn't stream at that time.

361
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:04,730
So I didn't No noise complaints.

362
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:10,270
And then I'll just be like, okay, here's like, here's some checks in advance.

363
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:24,490
So like, you know, I hope I have the money by then, but like, I think I have the money by then when you deposit these checks every month, but you don't have to pay.

364
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:26,350
You don't have to chase me in advance.

365
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:39,810
Okay, anyway, but yeah, so, so I hope that's the same because it's different now.

366
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:40,810
It's different now.

367
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:41,790
I have a dog.

368
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:43,730
And so I have a dog.

369
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,390
I stream.

370
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:48,230
And so there's going to be noise complaints maybe.

371
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:51,990
And it's like, I'm just like, oh man.

372
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:56,550
And it's so people, people don't fucking buy houses here.

373
00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:00,710
We all fucking rent because the housing market is fucking terrible in Canada.

374
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:03,690
I don't know how it can get worse, but it did.

375
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:06,710
I remember five years ago, I was like, how can this get worse?

376
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,330
And then it still gets worse.

377
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:15,140
Like it's still, buying houses can still go up.

378
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,120
Did we not learn anything from the first financial crisis?

379
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:23,780
Like, did we not learn anything from the first housing crash?

380
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,520
I don't know, but it's back up again.

381
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,100
Yeah.

382
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,400
And anyway, anyway.

383
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,600
I hope I'm still.

384
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,760
The ideal tenant.

385
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:44,080
Cause like, I've been like looking around for places to like, to see like where I could rent.

386
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,120
It's so hard.

387
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:53,540
It's so difficult because like, I have like so many other factors now that I'm like a streamer, like a content creator and I have a fucking pet.

388
00:21:53,820 --> 00:22:05,040
So there's so many factors to look into now when it comes to like, uh, when it comes to finding a place, just finding a pet friendly place is so difficult.

389
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,460
It's so fucking.

390
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,180
Difficult.

391
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,040
Anyway.

392
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,480
Anyway, everybody, sorry for the 23 minute tangent.

393
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,660
Guys, but let's play the game.

394
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:20,640
Yeah.

395
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,080
Where's fallout?

396
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:22,240
Okay.

397
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:22,960
There's fallout four.

398
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:23,900
It's time.

399
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,340
I'm super excited to try out fallout four.

400
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,600
I never played fallout four.

401
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,840
Uh, my, I never.

402
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,380
Whoa.

403
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,020
Sorry.

404
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,480
The game was like, went crazy.

405
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:45,500
On my, it's definitely not 244 Hertz because the game started like adjusting my Hertz and stuff and was like, this is not it.

406
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,560
Well, I tab, if I tab, I would've fucked with my, okay.

407
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,860
It didn't, I was going to say what it was like.

408
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,500
It like the monitor like flickered and stuff.

409
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,720
Oh, you saw that flicker.

410
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,420
Yeah.

411
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,800
Oh, please don't.

412
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,640
Oh my gosh.

413
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,500
Where's my cursor?

414
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,180
Where's the cursor?

415
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:17,980
Where's the cursor?

416
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,260
Where is it?

417
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,300
Wait.

418
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,340
Okay.

419
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:25,560
I see my cursor on the other monitor.

420
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:26,420
Ooh.

421
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:27,040
Okay.

422
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:27,980
Give me a sec guys.

423
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,060
I got to figure out where my, my cursor went.

424
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,000
Oh, Bethesda.

425
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:35,780
Bethesda.

426
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:36,820
Bethesda.

427
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:40,500
All right guys, let me restart the game.

428
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,040
I don't know where my cursor went.

429
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,460
I was like, where did it go?

430
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,820
It just works.

431
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,800
It just works.

432
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,300
Oh yeah.

433
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,020
Here we go.

434
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,720
Here we go.

435
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,220
All right.

436
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:57,500
Play.

437
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,560
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

438
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,280
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

439
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:03,840
Special.

440
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:05,760
Parts.

441
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:05,940
Six.

442
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,060
What makes you special?

443
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,320
What makes me special?

444
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,040
Whoa.

445
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,120
That's a nuclear bomb.

446
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,480
Total atomic

447
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:27,470
uneducational materials for you to better understand the seven defining attributes.

448
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:30,090
I don't have a controller plugged in.

449
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:31,370
What do you mean?

450
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:33,450
Agility.

451
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:34,170
Agility.

452
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:44,690
A nuclear blast and the subsequent fallout will have many adverse effects on life as we know it.

453
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:49,770
Intensive prolonged radiation exposure may transform.

454
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:50,310
Oh my God.

455
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:50,650
Good.

456
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:56,510
Into decrepit rotting beings that have lost their ability to reason.

457
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:59,530
I bet someone would still want to bang that though.

458
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:02,150
Common manners and quick to anger.

459
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,130
Not me.

460
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:03,610
Of course.

461
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:04,070
Not me.

462
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:05,510
To make the most of

463
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:11,630
will only take you so far.

464
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,890
Now let's try that again.

465
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:14,370
Yeah.

466
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:14,770
Me.

467
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:16,230
Straps.

468
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:20,850
Yes.

469
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:21,170
Me.

470
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,830
Especially after the show.

471
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:23,530
Oh.

472
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:25,950
Somebody here really liked the gore.

473
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:34,510
Whoa.

474
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:40,710
Who needs agility if I go all attack.

475
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:44,010
I only need agility if I shoot the head.

476
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:47,610
Okay.

477
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:49,990
Okay, we're never doing stealth by the way, guys.

478
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,240
Exactly!

479
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,580
No need to dodge if they're dead!

480
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:11,890
What?

481
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:17,750
What?

482
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:23,170
You have little targets when the...

483
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:28,410
Regularly study your Vault-Tec provided materials to prepare for survival.

484
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:29,550
Them?

485
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:34,210
And to answer the question, do you know what makes you special?

486
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:34,770
Yeah!

487
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:36,350
I do!

488
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:38,790
Because I'm anime.

489
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:40,870
Alright, there you go.

490
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:42,070
Where's my cursor?

491
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:47,630
What the fuck?

492
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:49,970
I did all that!

493
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:52,030
Where the fuck's my cursor?

494
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:57,650
I'm gonna plug in my controller and see if it finds my cursor.

495
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:01,710
I can't...

496
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:03,330
Where the fuck's my cursor?

497
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,350
I can't believe it!

498
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:13,890
I watched all that and my cursor still didn't fucking show up?

499
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,930
I am pressing enter.

500
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:20,590
Chat, I pressed enter.

501
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:21,750
Sorry, another flicker.

502
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:25,330
Guys!

503
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:28,530
I'm pressing space and enter!

504
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:30,610
I don't understand!

505
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,010
Oh my god!

506
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:39,110
It just works!

507
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:40,230
It just works!

508
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:45,190
Okay, guys.

509
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:46,070
Give me a sec.

510
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:46,950
I'm gonna Google this.

511
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:48,610
Where is my...

512
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:50,990
Where is my cursor?

513
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,130
It just fell out the floor.

514
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:57,890
Okay, disappearing is likely due to...

515
00:27:57,890 --> 00:27:58,810
Okay, it's not!

516
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:00,390
I don't have it!

517
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:01,850
Nope, okay.

518
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:03,450
Turns out... okay.

519
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:04,710
But it doesn't!

520
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:11,930
Go into the settings and turn off controller.

521
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:15,350
I think it falls under... that's how most games are...

522
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:18,230
My controller's not even plugged in!

523
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:22,490
What do they mean?

524
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:31,070
Okay guys, I'm gonna plug in Borderless windows you're so fucking right guys.

525
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:34,010
Okay, maybe borderless window will work.

526
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:39,930
Sorry Borderless Window mode.

527
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:40,470
Okay.

528
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:41,350
We're gonna window mode.

529
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:42,730
This is it.

530
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:47,770
This has to be it Alright, we're not watching agility and again

531
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:17,520
All right The cursor DLC You

532
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:30,620
You literally got so much of my money, Todd!

533
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:33,280
Why are you doing...

534
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:40,100
Why are you doing this to me?

535
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,880
I unplugged the controller, guys!

536
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,040
I unplugged it, I swear to God!

537
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,620
I unplugged it!

538
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:52,500
Alright, let's see...

539
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,740
Not plugged it back in.

540
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:58,420
Maybe if I just had my controller on, it would be fine.

541
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,000
I already had my controller on.

542
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,040
Okay.

543
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,660
Alright, let's watch this again.

544
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,560
Todd!

545
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:07,620
Please!

546
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:12,880
Okay.

547
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:15,820
You literally got so much of my money, Doki.

548
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,520
Why are you doing this to me?

549
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,280
I don't understand, Todd!

550
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,580
Where did it go?

551
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,320
I hid every key possible!

552
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,540
Oh my God!

553
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,300
Darn you, Todd!

554
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:40,300
Okay.

555
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,000
I know how to do this, guys.

556
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,640
Okay, we're just gonna...

557
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,120
We're just gonna go to our folders, apparently.

558
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,940
Let me figure...

559
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:49,920
What was it?

560
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,360
I need to go to the fucking...

561
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,720
I need to go edit a folder.

562
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:55,540
I need to go to my folder again, guys.

563
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,980
Oh my God.

564
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,320
Can I edit the...

565
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:58,800
Okay, wait.

566
00:30:58,980 --> 00:30:59,400
Is this...

567
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,200
Is this gonna be like Fallout 76?

568
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,440
I'm having the same issue.

569
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,540
Stuff off...

570
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,480
Maybe it will work.

571
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:06,000
Okay.

572
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:06,840
Alright.

573
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,700
Turns out it was my USB...

574
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,540
What the fuck?

575
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,240
Does anyone have the...

576
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:11,700
I found...

577
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,660
Disconnect your mouse.

578
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,360
Press shift plus tab.

579
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,280
Reconnect your mouse?

580
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,300
What?

581
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:18,940
Okay.

582
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,820
I got disconnect my mouse.

583
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,060
Shift tab.

584
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,720
Reconnect your mouse.

585
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,900
Uh...

586
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:27,740
Todd!

587
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,120
Please!

588
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,120
Alright.

589
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:32,680
Hey.

590
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:35,380
This is the authentic Pathesics.

591
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:39,920
Like, everything works but my cursor is not showing up.

592
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,500
Like, what?

593
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,900
Why is my cursor not showing up?

594
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,140
Todd!

595
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,640
Okay.

596
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,160
Um...

597
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:52,720
Try...

598
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,280
My game would...

599
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,100
My work worked for me I think.

600
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:56,940
Start going...

601
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:57,420
Exit...

602
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,500
What is this?

603
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,120
What...

604
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,360
Press E.

605
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,360
Okay.

606
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,420
It's not E guys.

607
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,980
Run this game as...

608
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,060
There's no way.

609
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,580
There's no fucking way.

610
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,900
Running a game on admin is the...

611
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:12,220
Alright.

612
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,380
Browse local files.

613
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,860
I swear to fucking god.

614
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:15,600
Alright.

615
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,560
Alright.

616
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,980
We're running it as admin.

617
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,580
Will it show up?

618
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,800
Will it register that I have a...

619
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,860
That I have a mouse?

620
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:24,260
Is it gonna show up?

621
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:24,520
Will it have a cursor?

622
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,740
Will it press A on your USB?

623
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,740
Okay I plugged in my controller!

624
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,940
And it didn't work.

625
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,300
The game...

626
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,680
Was rigged from the start.

627
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,520
It was...

628
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,300
It...

629
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:39,580
No.

630
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,600
Come on.

631
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,860
Come on Todd!

632
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:42,960
Todd!

633
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,320
Come on!

634
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:47,660
Todd!

635
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,320
Why Todd?

636
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,920
Alright, controller setting.

637
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,160
Settings.

638
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,160
Steam input.

639
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,580
Alright, okay.

640
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,460
Okay, your controller.

641
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:01,180
No, I don't wanna fucking- Okay, I'm gonna plug in my controller.

642
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,380
Alright, here we go.

643
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:08,120
This is like... tech support with the dragoons.

644
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,000
Just like the good old days.

645
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,340
Alright, here we go.

646
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,440
Plugged in my controller.

647
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,400
Alright, enable.

648
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:15,400
Alright.

649
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:16,760
Okay.

650
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:17,940
Alright.

651
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,100
Now we have- Now we're on controller.

652
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,480
Is that it?

653
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,180
Oh my god!

654
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,440
Okay, okay.

655
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,480
We got a controls display.

656
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:33,820
Okay guys, we gotta figure a way to make it so that we're not on controller.

657
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:39,680
I refuse to play this game on controller!

658
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,060
Alright.

659
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:48,220
Okay, how do I- Controller.

660
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:49,660
Off.

661
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,400
Wait, okay.

662
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,280
Does that mean it worked?

663
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,740
Where's my mouse?

664
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:02,980
Okay, now... does my mouse show up?

665
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:05,920
Oh, it doesn't look like my cursor shows up.

666
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,360
Guys!

667
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,360
Maybe it's just the main menu thing.

668
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:22,660
Guys.

669
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,180
Truly, Todd can't be wrong!

670
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:28,300
Carpook.

671
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,040
I'm trying to plug back in my controller.

672
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,700
I can't fucking fit in.

673
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:32,480
The USB slot.

674
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,560
Everything's going wrong.

675
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,420
Oh my god!

676
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,500
Why can't the- Why doesn't it fit in the hole?

677
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,260
Oh, that's what you want to hear.

678
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,160
Oh no!

679
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,140
Now I have nothing!

680
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:53,460
Okay.

681
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:53,940
Guys.

682
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,140
Okay guys.

683
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,520
This is starting to be a little bit of a mess.

684
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,000
Guys.

685
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,600
I- I understand that...

686
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:05,660
Now I can't even- Apparently, now I can't even turn it back on.

687
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:06,760
Guys, I fucked up!

688
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,000
Why did I turn off the controller?!

689
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,460
I fucked up!

690
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:18,060
I can't even use the controller anymore!

691
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,180
Oh my god!

692
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,240
I fucked up!

693
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:27,980
I won't even let me use the controller!

694
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:30,780
Because I turned it off!

695
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,500
Oh no!

696
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:34,920
Guys.

697
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:41,960
Guys, I realized I made a mistake when I turned off the controller.

698
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,380
It's eventually broken.

699
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,500
Wait, maybe it didn't register.

700
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,740
Maybe it just didn't register, guys.

701
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,780
Maybe it didn't- Don't wait!

702
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,820
This is all Todd's plan!

703
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,200
Todd knows what he's doing!

704
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,960
I believe- Oh, I knew it!

705
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,720
I knew I could believe in Todd!

706
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,900
Oh shit.

707
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:11,280
Okay, no, I don't want- Wait, there's mods?

708
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,020
Oh my god.

709
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:13,640
Wait.

710
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,620
Do I have to buy these mods?

711
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,420
Oh!

712
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,320
Can I install this?

713
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:21,080
Download- Oh, everyone's best friends?

714
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,200
Wait!

715
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,320
Does this mean I can have dog meat?

716
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,940
And- Okay, let's get dog meat and stuff.

717
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:30,460
Oh!

718
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,640
Does this- Oh my god, does this work?

719
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:33,580
Todd.

720
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:39,440
Don't- No, don't buy- Don't pay for those mods!

721
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,040
But that's what Todd wants though!

722
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:46,100
Todd wants me to pay for the mods!

723
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,640
I can't possibly even listen, but this is amazing content.

724
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,320
Thank you, Super Chat Mr. Broken Fod.

725
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,340
Thank you, thank you.

726
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,480
Oh my god!

727
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:59,100
Look, if Todd wants me to pay for mods, maybe he's right, you know?

728
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,260
Maybe he's right.

729
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,820
Oh, these are free?

730
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:04,660
Oh shit.

731
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:05,120
Okay.

732
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:08,360
I would pay- Todd, just letting you know.

733
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,880
If you monetize your mods, I would definitely pay for them.

734
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:21,460
Me and all the Todd believers would 100% pay for it.

735
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,360
Anyway.

736
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:31,560
I cannot believe I have to play this on- I can't believe I have to play this on controller.

737
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,980
Start a new game.

738
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:34,520
Yes.

739
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,480
Don't give it to all two of you!

740
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:39,380
Todd!

741
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,320
Do it, it would be so funny!

742
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:44,420
Okay.

743
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:50,800
Maybe- Guys, maybe, like, my mouse cursor will show up.

744
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:51,800
Guys.

745
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:55,160
Just as he- Just as intended!

746
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:56,600
Entirely trust!

747
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,360
Exactly!

748
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,380
TV, thank you for the super chat!

749
00:37:59,520 --> 00:37:59,800
Thank you!

750
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:00,300
Thank you!

751
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:04,580
If he can get away with Starfield, he can get away with paint marks!

752
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:12,740
Never changes.

753
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,880
He said the thing!

754
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:28,970
Serving in the army.

755
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:33,770
Wondered when he'd get to go home to his wife...

756
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:36,870
and the son he'd never seen.

757
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:41,150
He got his wish...

758
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:44,110
when the US ended World War II...

759
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:48,450
by dropping atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

760
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:52,650
The world awaited Armageddon.

761
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:55,570
Instead...

762
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:59,170
something miraculous happened.

763
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:04,130
We began to use atomic energy not as a weapon...

764
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:07,590
but as a nearly limitless source of power.

765
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:09,550
Oh my god, we did it!

766
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:12,550
Enjoyed luxuries once thought the realm of science fiction...

767
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,930
Surely no one would use it for bad!

768
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,530
Fusion powered cars...

769
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:19,550
portable computers...

770
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:20,530
And then the world...

771
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:22,470
And then we discovered world peace, right?

772
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:24,010
Right?

773
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:25,450
In the 21st century...

774
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:29,650
People awoke from the American dream.

775
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:30,090
What the fuck?

776
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,290
Give this kid a knife!

777
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:35,090
Years of consumption led to shortages of every major resource.

778
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:38,830
Subtitles?

779
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:42,130
Look, I forgot to turn subtitles on because I was going through a lot.

780
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:47,930
It's understandable!

781
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:50,730
I went through like the five stages of grief just then!

782
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:52,490
In 30 minutes!

783
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:54,410
We stand on the brink of total...

784
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:58,710
And I am afraid...

785
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:01,730
For myself...

786
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:05,090
For my wife...

787
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:06,970
For my wife?

788
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:10,170
Wait, who's the...

789
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:11,350
Because of my time in the army...

790
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:11,950
Who's the narrator?

791
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:13,390
Is this the lone wanderer?

792
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:14,270
The sole survivor?

793
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:16,430
The vault dweller?

794
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:18,330
Who the fuck is narrating this?

795
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:19,670
It's the war...

796
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,080
War never changes.

797
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:24,680
Wow!

798
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,520
War never changes.

799
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,280
It's me!

800
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,040
The chosen one?

801
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,120
Who is it?

802
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:37,560
Oh, that's me!

803
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,500
I'm never gonna have my cursor.

804
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,960
Oh, it was me!

805
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:52,080
Is default guy supposed to be like... Todd?

806
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,360
Oh my gosh.

807
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,800
Okay, let me see if I can...

808
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,420
Okay guys, unfortunately...

809
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:57,780
Um...

810
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:04,660
Unfortunately, I'm gonna have to use this for...

811
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,880
Use the controller for now.

812
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,940
Alright, who do I wanna look like?

813
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,220
Oh my god!

814
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,020
That light looks like...

815
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,220
God, what's his name?

816
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,180
That guy from...

817
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,960
Oh, General Hux from...

818
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:15,900
From Star Wars.

819
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,960
Do I wanna be Ginger again?

820
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,340
No, I wanna be a guy, cause like...

821
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,560
The girl's a lawyer.

822
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:25,860
And like, I don't know.

823
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:26,960
I don't think I can...

824
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,700
I don't think a lawyer can survive...

825
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:29,580
What?

826
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:29,840
What?

827
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,080
Sorry.

828
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,000
What am I...

829
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,420
What am I gonna do?

830
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,360
Like...

831
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:37,660
Fucking...

832
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,820
Argue myself to safety?

833
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:42,860
Like...

834
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:43,980
Be a...

835
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,560
Be a Ginger again?

836
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,660
Alright guys, should we be Ginger again?

837
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:49,720
You're right.

838
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:50,320
Maybe I'll...

839
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,520
Maybe I can survive.

840
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,400
Wait, I should...

841
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,180
I don't want him to look...

842
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:57,180
I don't want my husband to look like that.

843
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:57,920
Like...

844
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:00,280
Wait...

845
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,560
Let me change him...

846
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,460
Let me change him back.

847
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,300
I'll make him Default Todd.

848
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:06,280
I'll make him...

849
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,860
I'll make him Default Todd real quick.

850
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,040
Where's Default Todd?

851
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:10,760
There it is.

852
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,300
Alright, and then...

853
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:13,320
Um...

854
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:16,660
I'm just saying, lawyers are not making it in the wasteland.

855
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:18,380
She's like a lawyer, apparently.

856
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,020
Alright, we're gonna make her Ginger.

857
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:23,260
We're gonna go like the Fallout 76 way.

858
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:25,360
Gingers will survive.

859
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,980
We're gonna make sure the Gingers don't die out.

860
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,000
Uh...

861
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:29,820
Let's see.

862
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,220
How do I do this?

863
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,220
Okay, we...

864
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:35,120
My eyes are up here.

865
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:38,220
Wait, I should...

866
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,840
Were you looking at Dragoons?

867
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:40,900
My eyes are up here.

868
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,320
Um...

869
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,200
Okay, let's see.

870
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:45,880
Uh...

871
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:46,620
And then...

872
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:47,460
Let's...

873
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:48,640
Let's...

874
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,060
There you go.

875
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,120
Alright, let me make sure that...

876
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:57,740
Alright, let's see.

877
00:42:58,660 --> 00:42:59,140
Uh...

878
00:42:59,140 --> 00:42:59,900
Let's...

879
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:00,520
Let me cook!

880
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,160
Okay, Sultry...

881
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:04,640
Uh...

882
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:06,260
Okay.

883
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:08,500
Is there no long hair?

884
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:09,740
Agent X?

885
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,020
No, what?

886
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:12,040
What are these names?

887
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:13,160
Fairy tales?

888
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:14,740
Femme Fatale?

889
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,900
Does this look like a Femme Fatale?

890
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,680
Look, I need them to look at my eyes.

891
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,160
They're the gateway to my soul.

892
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:27,520
Can't have them looking anywhere else.

893
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,060
If I...

894
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:29,880
So I can tell...

895
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,520
I can tell that they're looking at the right areas.

896
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:32,740
Where's like...

897
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:34,100
Natural Beauty?

898
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,160
Public Defender?

899
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:37,660
Where's long hair?

900
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:42,140
I guess like in the wasteland you don't want long hair because it's a bitch to clean.

901
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:43,900
Um...

902
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,520
Oh, I look fucking crazy with that.

903
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:50,780
Uh...

904
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:52,000
I don't know.

905
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:53,040
Alright.

906
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:55,320
I'll go with...

907
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,960
I guess Elegant.

908
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:58,580
Blonde, brunette, purple.

909
00:43:58,920 --> 00:43:59,760
Let's see.

910
00:43:59,840 --> 00:43:59,880
I don't know.

911
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:03,240
Maybe I should look crazy so no one will get close to me.

912
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:11,080
No, no.

913
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:13,120
Like, oh no, we can't get close to her.

914
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,380
Even though I'm like a lawyer.

915
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,020
It's all about...

916
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,860
It's all about like faking it till you make it, you know?

917
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:23,600
So like, I should like look fucked up so that you won't get close to me.

918
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:24,240
Rough night.

919
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:25,960
Oh shit.

920
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:28,220
This was literally called Crazy Warning.

921
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:29,380
Alright.

922
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:33,680
I guess the pigtails.

923
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:34,340
Yeah.

924
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,140
Yeah, we'll go with that.

925
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:38,240
Okay, and then color.

926
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:39,500
Color.

927
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:40,960
Deep red.

928
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:42,580
Ginger!

929
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:44,340
Wait, is that...

930
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:45,220
Oh, okay.

931
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:46,180
Alright.

932
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:47,980
Guys, I'm beautiful.

933
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,960
Guys, I'm like...

934
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:51,280
I'm...

935
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,200
I'm...

936
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,840
Gingers are dying out because like...

937
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:56,480
Because it's a recessive gene.

938
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,380
So I'm gonna help save the gingers.

939
00:44:59,400 --> 00:44:59,880
I'm gonna...

940
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:01,420
Let's see.

941
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:03,480
I think that's good.

942
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:04,360
And then...

943
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,860
What else can I...

944
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:07,140
I'm gonna help save.

945
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,260
I'm gonna save the population.

946
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,100
We're gonna repopulate.

947
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,180
Wait, I said that wrong.

948
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,440
Wait, wait a minute.

949
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,640
Alright, let's see.

950
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:25,400
Damage?

951
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:28,740
What's the damage?

952
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:29,640
Oh, no.

953
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:29,860
Damage.

954
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:32,060
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

955
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:34,300
Is that...

956
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:35,120
Oh my gosh.

957
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:36,140
I'm so fucked up.

958
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:37,220
Okay, we got...

959
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:40,100
Did she just say looking good?

960
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,220
Try my best, sweetie.

961
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:45,760
I'm trying my best.

962
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:46,920
Oh, I can have more freckles?

963
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,420
No, actually, I think I'm okay with that.

964
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:50,360
Alright.

965
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:52,400
Let's see.

966
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:53,360
Uh...

967
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:53,980
Body.

968
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,620
Alright, like I said in 76.

969
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,800
We gotta be...

970
00:45:58,800 --> 00:45:59,340
What?

971
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:00,300
Shit!

972
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:02,060
Okay.

973
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:07,220
Okay, wait, wait.

974
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:13,140
Guys, as I said in 76, guys, it's all about...

975
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,120
Look.

976
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:24,420
The more arm muscle you have, the more attractive you are in the wasteland chat.

977
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,820
It's all about the muscle.

978
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:28,980
They'll hire me.

979
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:29,820
Because...

980
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:32,280
They'll be like, oh shit, we need that muscle.

981
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:34,760
Ginger, diamond, thank you for the super chat.

982
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:35,420
Thank you, thank you.

983
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,220
We're dying up.

984
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:37,100
Yes, you guys!

985
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:37,820
I told you!

986
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:39,540
In the 76 stream!

987
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:41,100
I told you!

988
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:42,540
Um...

989
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,040
The...

990
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,260
Because, like, having...

991
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:48,640
Having, like, red hair is, like, a recessive trait.

992
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:50,860
And apparently, there's been, like...

993
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:54,600
Apparently, like, it's starting to, like, be phased out.

994
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:55,540
The longer...

995
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:58,980
The more years have passed, it's starting to be phased out more and more and more.

996
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:00,000
So...

997
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,640
So there's, like, eventually, there's gonna be no more gingers.

998
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:05,740
Which is so fucked up to think about.

999
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,080
It's actually...

1000
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:08,980
It is.

1001
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:12,020
Because it's, like, having red hair is a mutation.

1002
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:13,600
Same with blue eyes.

1003
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,820
Uh, having blue eyes is a genetic mutation.

1004
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,040
Along with red hair.

1005
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:20,740
And they're both, like, considered recessive genes.

1006
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:27,220
So, like, if, like, obviously, if, like, somebody with, like, different colored eyes or, like, colored hair...

1007
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:29,920
Was, uh, you know, got...

1008
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,420
Like, if their wife, husband, um...

1009
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:37,220
Had, like, a different color eyes or hair that's not red hair...

1010
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:41,520
Or, uh, red hair or, like, uh, blue eyes...

1011
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,580
Usually, the kids will not have those traits.

1012
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:47,700
So, that's why, like, uh...

1013
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:53,020
That's why, like, gingers are slowly being phased out.

1014
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:54,400
Because it's a recessive gene.

1015
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:59,720
She called me a mutant.

1016
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,700
Because to keep the bloodline going for gingers...

1017
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,160
You have to, like...

1018
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,460
You have to, like, marry another ginger.

1019
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:15,080
Or, like, have kids with another ginger to guarantee red hair.

1020
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:16,320
But, like...

1021
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:17,900
Like, obviously, like...

1022
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:19,940
If you do that too long, then...

1023
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:21,560
Then we have an issue of inbreeding.

1024
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,220
So, we don't want that.

1025
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,120
We don't want...

1026
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,340
Wait, okay, wait.

1027
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:27,200
Uh-huh.

1028
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:27,980
The husband needs...

1029
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:28,720
I just realized.

1030
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:30,220
The husband...

1031
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:34,640
The husband needs to...

1032
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,000
Uh...

1033
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,920
They're not dying out of recessive genes.

1034
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:40,980
Don't stop existing until there's...

1035
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:43,720
Well, they're, like, slowly getting phased out!

1036
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:44,840
And so, we...

1037
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,480
They're rarer and rarer!

1038
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:48,100
It's true!

1039
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,920
They're rarer and rarer!

1040
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:51,500
Okay, wait.

1041
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:51,980
Sound guy.

1042
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:52,760
Uh...

1043
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:53,800
Alright.

1044
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:55,660
Sorry.

1045
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:56,360
I need to...

1046
00:48:57,220 --> 00:48:57,480
There...

1047
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:00,620
Okay.

1048
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,160
So, we know why he died.

1049
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:09,420
I may be a lawyer, but...

1050
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:12,860
But it doesn't stop me from getting these gains!

1051
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:14,380
There we go.

1052
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,420
There we go.

1053
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:16,900
They're endangered.

1054
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,180
Yes, they're, like, an endangered species.

1055
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:28,700
Alright, there we go.

1056
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:30,500
I'm ready.

1057
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:32,700
This is me.

1058
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,260
This is us.

1059
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:38,840
This is Defy Snoo Snoo.

1060
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:43,060
Okay, but the sound guy wanted me to change.

1061
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,760
Alright, settings, audio.

1062
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:48,620
Okay, sound guy, what did you want again?

1063
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:51,700
I was too busy customizing my character.

1064
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:56,780
Let's see, radio down a little bit.

1065
00:49:56,780 --> 00:50:01,600
Also, I heard that the radio actually gets you demonetized.

1066
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:05,580
So it doesn't matter even if I got like, striked by profanity or whatever.

1067
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,500
So like, I won't be getting...

1068
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,960
I feel like I won't be getting ad revenue at all.

1069
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:11,900
So...

1070
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,760
I definitely won't be getting any ad revenue, guys.

1071
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,060
From this stream.

1072
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:20,600
So we're gonna be in it for that.

1073
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:22,280
Uhhh...

1074
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:25,300
Alright, overall up.

1075
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:25,660
Okay.

1076
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,260
I'll boost up the overall.

1077
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:30,320
Alright.

1078
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:32,460
I hope this works.

1079
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:34,040
Alright.

1080
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:35,980
Uhhh...

1081
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:36,920
Guys, should I...

1082
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:37,640
Should I...

1083
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:38,300
Okay, no.

1084
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,440
I'm gonna get to a save state.

1085
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:40,400
Okay, I'm gonna save.

1086
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:41,140
Quick save.

1087
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:42,140
Alright, guys.

1088
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:44,120
Should we play around and see...

1089
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:48,240
See if I can get my cursor show up this time?

1090
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:49,100
Alright, let's try.

1091
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:50,560
Guys, I think...

1092
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:51,880
I think we can do this.

1093
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:55,980
Okay, I turned the controller off.

1094
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:56,780
Where my mouse?

1095
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:57,980
Where my mouse?

1096
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:01,580
Controller...

1097
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:02,420
Off.

1098
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:03,480
Alright.

1099
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:04,480
Back on.

1100
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:05,160
I see.

1101
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:06,700
Controller...

1102
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:07,120
Off.

1103
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:08,280
Alright.

1104
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:09,820
It's back on.

1105
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:13,520
Okay.

1106
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,500
Let's get the subtitles on.

1107
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:16,100
Might as well.

1108
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:16,780
Dialogue.

1109
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:17,580
General subtitles.

1110
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:19,060
HUD.

1111
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:20,620
Pip-Boy colors.

1112
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:22,980
Uhhh...

1113
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:24,060
Actor fade.

1114
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:25,360
Uhhh...

1115
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:28,180
Alright.

1116
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:31,380
Todd, why...

1117
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:32,900
Okay,

1118
00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:39,990
we fucking did it.

1119
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:41,690
Oh my god!

1120
00:51:41,950 --> 00:51:44,510
I told you, Todd is always right!

1121
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:45,770
Todd!

1122
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:50,190
Never doubt Todd again!

1123
00:51:50,670 --> 00:51:51,230
Chad!

1124
00:51:51,330 --> 00:51:53,610
I fucking knew giving him more money was the...

1125
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:57,250
I knew giving him 40 fucking dollars was the right thing to do.

1126
00:51:57,490 --> 00:51:58,310
Like, of course...

1127
00:51:58,310 --> 00:51:59,330
He needs more money, guys.

1128
00:51:59,330 --> 00:51:59,890
He needs...

1129
00:51:59,890 --> 00:52:01,390
He has a family to support it.

1130
00:52:01,430 --> 00:52:03,430
Oh, and George, thank you for the super chat.

1131
00:52:03,570 --> 00:52:04,050
Thank you.

1132
00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:04,770
Thank you.

1133
00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:05,790
And money.

1134
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:07,750
Love these background music.

1135
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:08,650
Alright.

1136
00:52:09,070 --> 00:52:09,950
Just worked.

1137
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:10,650
Doubters.

1138
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:12,150
You got all the fucking doubters.

1139
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:13,710
Encounter legend...

1140
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:14,470
Survival ads.

1141
00:52:14,650 --> 00:52:15,710
Okay, what is like hard?

1142
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:17,010
Uh...

1143
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:17,970
Legend...

1144
00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:18,330
You know what?

1145
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:19,970
I think we can survive hard.

1146
00:52:21,290 --> 00:52:23,810
Okay, we're not doing very hard, but we'll do hard.

1147
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:24,790
Alright.

1148
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:26,110
I think it'll be fine.

1149
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:27,830
It just works.

1150
00:52:28,870 --> 00:52:29,310
Name.

1151
00:52:29,310 --> 00:52:30,630
Hey, hun.

1152
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:31,670
Hey, hun.

1153
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:32,350
Just getting ready.

1154
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:35,110
Alright.

1155
00:52:35,310 --> 00:52:36,490
How's the volume now?

1156
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:38,450
Oh, hey!

1157
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:39,050
It's my robot!

1158
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:39,910
Codsworth!

1159
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:45,680
Whoa!

1160
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:48,560
Don't spill it on my lap!

1161
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:53,900
Oh.

1162
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:54,740
Thanks, Codsworth.

1163
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:55,280
Thank you!

1164
00:52:57,220 --> 00:52:58,580
There's my sugar bombs!

1165
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:01,920
100% daily value of sugar.

1166
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:05,100
Oh, hey!

1167
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:05,260
Alright.

1168
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:05,940
Let's see.

1169
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:12,160
Hey, hun.

1170
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:12,700
Annie!

1171
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:13,900
I can't believe it's almost Halloween.

1172
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:15,140
That was Halloween?

1173
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:18,360
Well, there's my newspaper!

1174
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,120
Wait, we have two newspapers?

1175
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:22,360
More of the same.

1176
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:25,360
Oh, sounds like someone made a sticky.

1177
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,700
I should attend to young Sean.

1178
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:29,120
Oh, yeah.

1179
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:29,940
My kid's Sean.

1180
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,800
I'm glad we got Codsworth.

1181
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,080
I wonder how much he cost.

1182
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,240
Wait, what the fuck is this fridge?

1183
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:37,760
Oh, my God!

1184
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:38,620
It has a window!

1185
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:38,660
Oh, my God!

1186
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:40,080
It has a window so we can see inside!

1187
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,040
That's so smart!

1188
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:44,220
Nuka-Cola.

1189
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:45,220
Nuka-Cola.

1190
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:47,020
Ice cold.

1191
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,460
Saddle up Salisbury steak.

1192
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:51,780
That's so smart, but where do I get the ice?

1193
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:53,320
At the bottom!

1194
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:57,580
As someone that always forgets what's in my fridge, that is so fucking smart.

1195
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:58,920
Oh, my God!

1196
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:08,340
Okay, you know, I said, like, I know the intro by heart, but I literally forgot what's, like, in, like, the setting of everything because my dad just skips through so fast.

1197
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:08,640
I'm so sorry.

1198
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:15,020
He just speed runs to, like, to, like, getting into the vault.

1199
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:18,200
I forgot what everything, the setting, the immersion was like.

1200
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:23,820
Alright.

1201
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:29,420
Oh, it's like, like, the vault thing!

1202
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,380
He's selling the vault to me!

1203
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:33,780
Where's the door?

1204
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:35,440
Is that my door?

1205
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:36,760
What the fuck is that?

1206
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,140
Oh, that's the back door.

1207
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:40,120
Sorry, the door should have been yellow.

1208
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:41,820
Okay, I'm not gonna get in here.

1209
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:42,280
Good morning!

1210
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:43,080
Hello!

1211
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:45,560
Wait, do I need to interact with my son?

1212
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:46,260
Give me a sec.

1213
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:47,760
Where's my son?

1214
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:49,680
Hello, son!

1215
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:53,260
Oh my God, you're so ugly!

1216
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:54,880
You're clearly not Ginger.

1217
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:56,740
Where are my freckles?

1218
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:58,000
I told you!

1219
00:54:58,580 --> 00:54:59,980
They're phasing out!

1220
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:02,180
My son's not Ginger!

1221
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,240
How dare he?

1222
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:06,320
Okay, there you go.

1223
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:06,960
Hello?

1224
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:10,120
Go on.

1225
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:10,580
I can't hear you!

1226
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:24,300
Urgency?

1227
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:24,940
Why?

1228
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:26,940
Oh shit!

1229
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:27,900
He had a nuclear bomb!

1230
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:31,320
Doki Doki never changes.

1231
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:49,680
Wait, how would you know?

1232
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:50,360
Huh?

1233
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:56,840
Yeah, you're encroaching on my fucking gym time.

1234
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:14,400
I've been preselected?

1235
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:16,720
Wait, what?

1236
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:18,460
Enough space?

1237
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:19,620
I don't need to...

1238
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,720
God, I look beautiful.

1239
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:23,900
Wouldn't you have to pay for it?

1240
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:33,060
I thought you had to pay.

1241
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:44,240
Wait.

1242
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:45,220
Tell me more.

1243
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:48,800
It's like a pyramid scheme and I'm all for it.

1244
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,160
Pyramid schemes are not a scam.

1245
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:56,000
Because if you get to the top...

1246
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:00,840
It's not a scam.

1247
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:04,020
You just don't know how it works.

1248
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:13,300
All I'm saying is that if you're at the middle tier of a pyramid scheme...

1249
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:16,440
Or like the higher tier you are in the pyramid scheme...

1250
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:18,040
The more money you make.

1251
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:19,900
So it's not my...

1252
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:22,900
So it's your fault if you don't make any.

1253
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:28,200
Okay.

1254
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:28,800
Sorry.

1255
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:33,740
It's not a scam if you're at the top.

1256
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:35,720
That's the spirit.

1257
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:39,660
Okay.

1258
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:40,620
Alright.

1259
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:41,220
Nice.

1260
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:42,600
Alright.

1261
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:43,240
Uh...

1262
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:44,620
Strength.

1263
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:50,020
Okay.

1264
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:52,400
Okay.

1265
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:55,420
We're gonna have it on strength.

1266
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:56,580
And then...

1267
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:57,760
Which one is the...

1268
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,000
Doki Smash.

1269
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,120
Okay.

1270
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:04,340
Um...

1271
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:07,480
The strongest lawyer there is.

1272
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:10,300
Don't use my brains as a lawyer.

1273
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:13,260
They're just fully intimidated at that point.

1274
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:14,220
Okay.

1275
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:15,000
Um...

1276
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,040
What else is good?

1277
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:16,320
Alright.

1278
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,420
Now that I have 12 more points...

1279
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:19,420
What else should I put?

1280
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:20,180
Charisma?

1281
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:21,400
Alright.

1282
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:22,880
No one...

1283
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,260
Which one's gun?

1284
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:25,380
Guys.

1285
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:25,900
Guys.

1286
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:26,880
Which one is gun?

1287
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:27,860
By the way.

1288
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:30,560
Um...

1289
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:31,480
Oh yeah.

1290
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:33,320
I should put like 5 in endurance.

1291
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:34,860
Uh...

1292
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:36,900
Basically...

1293
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:38,000
Geog.

1294
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:39,060
Guys.

1295
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:40,540
I need to know which one's gun.

1296
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:41,980
Is it actually agility?

1297
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:44,420
Agility is for pistol?

1298
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:44,860
Okay.

1299
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:45,340
There we go.

1300
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:46,140
Alright.

1301
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:47,640
I think it's perfect.

1302
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:49,640
I... I honestly...

1303
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:50,340
Uh...

1304
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:51,320
I think...

1305
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:53,200
Agility...

1306
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,120
Agility and perception?

1307
00:58:56,180 --> 00:58:56,700
Alright.

1308
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:58,180
There we go.

1309
00:58:58,640 --> 00:58:59,720
I think we're fine.

1310
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:03,180
I think this is perfect guys.

1311
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:03,840
Hahaha.

1312
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:08,020
Look.

1313
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:11,980
All we need is strength and gun.

1314
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:13,600
We don't need anything else.

1315
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:15,700
Worst lawyer ever.

1316
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:16,800
Guys!

1317
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:17,980
Did you not see me?

1318
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:18,760
Guys!

1319
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,520
If I could, I'd put everything on strength.

1320
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:22,780
If I could.

1321
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:24,460
Hahaha.

1322
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:26,980
Strength and perspective.

1323
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:27,840
Look.

1324
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:29,940
Do you not see my guns?

1325
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:32,500
I meant my fucking two guns right here.

1326
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:34,180
My left gun and my right gun.

1327
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:36,060
I did not mean the other gun.

1328
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:39,440
Doki smashed!

1329
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:42,040
Thank you for the search chat.

1330
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:42,400
Thank you.

1331
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:43,000
Thank you.

1332
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:43,640
Alright.

1333
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:47,980
Real female Doki.

1334
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:49,380
There you go.

1335
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:55,580
Wait, actually I needed like real female Doki.

1336
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:57,980
Let's throw it back to 76.

1337
00:59:58,320 --> 00:59:58,820
Alright, accept.

1338
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:00,300
Why can't I accept it?

1339
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:02,960
Why can't I accept it?

1340
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:04,980
Huh?

1341
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:07,280
Oh, there you go.

1342
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:08,120
Alright.

1343
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:09,680
Very real.

1344
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:14,180
Alright.

1345
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:15,220
Nice.

1346
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:20,120
Yay!

1347
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:26,280
We did it, honey!

1348
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:28,700
We're in the vault!

1349
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:36,340
Alright.

1350
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:38,040
Here you go.

1351
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,420
Cogsworth, can you say my name?

1352
01:00:46,290 --> 01:00:48,050
Don't worry, Cogsworth.

1353
01:00:48,870 --> 01:00:49,950
Mamas here.

1354
01:00:51,090 --> 01:00:53,050
Hey, Cogsworth.

1355
01:00:54,030 --> 01:00:57,930
If I may, Sean requires your personal attention.

1356
01:00:58,370 --> 01:01:01,150
A little motherly love to quiet the nerves.

1357
01:01:01,890 --> 01:01:02,570
Don't.

1358
01:01:02,570 --> 01:01:03,310
Don't worry.

1359
01:01:04,050 --> 01:01:06,650
Mama's here to love my child.

1360
01:01:12,570 --> 01:01:13,790
Hello, Sean.

1361
01:01:22,530 --> 01:01:23,730
Hello, Sean.

1362
01:01:25,130 --> 01:01:25,650
Oh, my gosh.

1363
01:01:26,330 --> 01:01:27,110
Don't look down on my reputation.

1364
01:01:27,110 --> 01:01:29,670
camera thing will never close.

1365
01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:34,850
Just arms and feet.

1366
01:01:35,070 --> 01:01:35,410
Not a shot.

1367
01:01:35,410 --> 01:01:35,670
Don't talk much on the phone.

1368
01:01:35,670 --> 01:01:35,730
Don't hush.

1369
01:01:36,110 --> 01:01:36,330
Now get out there.

1370
01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:37,290
Okay.

1371
01:01:37,290 --> 01:01:40,010
You have to be smart in that.

1372
01:01:40,050 --> 01:01:43,470
On my.

1373
01:01:43,470 --> 01:01:43,770
Do what?

1374
01:01:43,970 --> 01:01:44,670
What?

1375
01:01:44,890 --> 01:01:45,890
Do what?

1376
01:01:46,090 --> 01:01:46,270
Yeah.

1377
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:50,830
The fucking hell of a neck!

1378
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:53,130
What?

1379
01:01:54,790 --> 01:01:56,170
Press E to shine.

1380
01:01:57,370 --> 01:01:58,750
What is it, Cogsworth?

1381
01:02:05,610 --> 01:02:06,350
Where's the bomb?

1382
01:02:06,730 --> 01:02:07,350
Where's the mushroom?

1383
01:02:10,990 --> 01:02:11,750
What?

1384
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:23,610
What's that say?

1385
01:02:23,690 --> 01:02:25,650
Let's just sit here and not do anything.

1386
01:02:26,570 --> 01:02:27,730
Can we die in the beginning?

1387
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:32,090
No, it's happening.

1388
01:02:32,830 --> 01:02:33,990
Please stand by.

1389
01:02:34,770 --> 01:02:35,690
Who opened the door?

1390
01:02:37,910 --> 01:02:39,850
Who the fuck opened the door?

1391
01:02:40,530 --> 01:02:42,190
There's ghosts here too?

1392
01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:49,130
I'm not going in.

1393
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:50,870
I wonder if I can actually...

1394
01:02:50,870 --> 01:02:54,890
Todd, from the fate of Todd himself, he opened the door.

1395
01:02:56,510 --> 01:02:57,390
Who cares?

1396
01:03:01,030 --> 01:03:01,910
Just leave!

1397
01:03:02,330 --> 01:03:02,750
It's life!

1398
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:04,270
Oh my god, you're gonna wait for me?

1399
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:05,190
What a sweet husband!

1400
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,340
Don't worry, I'm in the program.

1401
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:13,860
I literally just volunteered.

1402
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:14,840
Get in.

1403
01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:16,020
I'm going in.

1404
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:17,160
You can't start!

1405
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:18,900
He's the Vault-Tec rep.

1406
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:19,720
Where was...

1407
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:20,500
Okay, okay.

1408
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:21,600
We're not in the program.

1409
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:22,660
I'm reporting this!

1410
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:25,120
I'm reporting this.

1411
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:26,920
Wait, he doesn't get in?

1412
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:28,860
That's so fucked.

1413
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:30,240
He literally like...

1414
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,380
You need to get in.

1415
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:33,440
...tried to scam me into a pyramid scheme.

1416
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:35,220
But it's not a scam, guys.

1417
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:36,360
Adult male.

1418
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:37,860
Adult female.

1419
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:39,920
Okay, go ahead.

1420
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:40,780
He's in the program.

1421
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:41,240
Thank you.

1422
01:03:41,380 --> 01:03:42,320
Good luck, sir.

1423
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:43,960
And god help us all.

1424
01:03:44,060 --> 01:03:44,620
Go let us in.

1425
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:46,480
Oh my god, look, there's the power army.

1426
01:03:46,780 --> 01:03:47,440
Head to the elevator.

1427
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:47,720
Head to the elevator.

1428
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:50,420
Wait, why is your voice so high?

1429
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:52,840
It should be like super low because you're in the power army.

1430
01:03:53,020 --> 01:03:53,140
Follow me!

1431
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:53,820
Come on!

1432
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:55,880
What's going to happen to all those people outside the gate?

1433
01:03:56,020 --> 01:03:56,060
Hey!

1434
01:03:56,060 --> 01:03:56,780
We're doing everything we can!

1435
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:57,780
Now keep moving!

1436
01:03:58,200 --> 01:03:58,680
Follow me!

1437
01:03:58,800 --> 01:03:59,920
DarkFox, thank you for the super chat!

1438
01:03:59,980 --> 01:04:00,260
Thank you!

1439
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:00,780
Thank you!

1440
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:01,320
Zoom!

1441
01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:03,080
Nuclear launch detected.

1442
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:04,640
Excuse me.

1443
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:07,180
Go, go, go!

1444
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,040
Can I tank this?

1445
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:10,900
Can I technically not die?

1446
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:15,580
When will the nuclear bomb drop?

1447
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:17,060
Oh, it's not going to die.

1448
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:17,080
It's going to die.

1449
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:18,200
It'll be fun.

1450
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:22,140
Oh, that's just a show.

1451
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:23,800
I thought it was like a thing.

1452
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:25,020
I'm waiting.

1453
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:29,880
When is it going to show up?

1454
01:04:30,260 --> 01:04:32,900
These guys are like, please, please, Doki.

1455
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:35,360
Please open, let us in.

1456
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:37,780
Wait, can I?

1457
01:04:37,820 --> 01:04:38,660
Wait, I should quick save.

1458
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:39,140
I should.

1459
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:45,080
I mean, what's the worst that's going to happen?

1460
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:45,480
I die?

1461
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:47,040
Look at me.

1462
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:50,260
I'm pretty sure I'll just be a fucking strong ghoul.

1463
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:53,320
There's no bomb.

1464
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:55,240
What if it was just a false alarm?

1465
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:56,400
You guys don't know that.

1466
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:01,940
Guys, I bet you it's just a false alarm.

1467
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:08,300
I literally have 10 durability, like 10 on strength.

1468
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:11,820
And what if I become She-Hulk?

1469
01:05:12,380 --> 01:05:14,980
I already got like the first half of it done.

1470
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:16,620
I just need a radiation part.

1471
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:17,700
I...

1472
01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:24,040
Wait, can you actually explore the town?

1473
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:25,480
Oh my God.

1474
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:27,220
What if I just explore the town?

1475
01:05:27,780 --> 01:05:30,260
I've never actually explored the town before.

1476
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:33,320
I feel like it let me because it's scripted.

1477
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:34,780
Why don't they let us in?

1478
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:41,120
10 strength versus...

1479
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:42,720
Nah, I'd win.

1480
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:44,380
I mean, I feel like...

1481
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:46,160
I feel like...

1482
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:49,260
Because it's scripted, you're actually allowed to like...

1483
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:58,860
Guys, you weren't allowed to explore the town.

1484
01:05:59,100 --> 01:05:59,780
Let's go in.

1485
01:06:01,220 --> 01:06:02,220
Let's go in.

1486
01:06:06,860 --> 01:06:08,460
We'll be okay.

1487
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:10,380
Yeah, guys, we'll be okay.

1488
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:11,100
What happened?

1489
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:11,940
Whoa!

1490
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:18,480
Oh my God.

1491
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:19,320
There it is.

1492
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:20,040
Don't worry.

1493
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:21,420
We'll slowly go down.

1494
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:21,980
Yay!

1495
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:25,240
I mean, they have power armor.

1496
01:06:25,340 --> 01:06:25,840
They'll be fine.

1497
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:33,540
How was I supposed to know?

1498
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:35,620
I thought it was just a government hoax.

1499
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:37,460
It was a fear tactic.

1500
01:06:43,860 --> 01:06:47,180
I can't believe I didn't turn into the...

1501
01:06:47,180 --> 01:06:49,920
I can't believe I didn't turn into She-Hulk.

1502
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:52,960
I can't believe I didn't turn into the...

1503
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:53,580
Are you all right?

1504
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:54,960
You all right, hubby?

1505
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:56,720
Oh, yeah.

1506
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:58,540
Bro, maybe I should hold the child.

1507
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:00,400
I feel like your arm's gonna break any moment.

1508
01:07:01,020 --> 01:07:01,800
I feel like your arms are gonna break any moment.

1509
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:02,880
My spaghetti-ass husband.

1510
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:04,440
If we left a minute later...

1511
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:08,100
No, no, don't get caught up thinking about that.

1512
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:08,300
If we left a minute later...

1513
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:08,660
If we left a minute later...

1514
01:07:08,660 --> 01:07:09,480
You're safe now.

1515
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:10,420
Yeah, we're safe!

1516
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:12,280
Everyone just head up these stairs.

1517
01:07:12,340 --> 01:07:13,740
And through the door there.

1518
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:14,140
Hey!

1519
01:07:14,540 --> 01:07:15,440
Up the stairs.

1520
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,160
Alright, let's go.

1521
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:27,100
Yeah, that's me!

1522
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:27,680
Real female!

1523
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:33,060
I thought he was calling my name.

1524
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:35,440
But I was like, oh my god, he said my name!

1525
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:37,520
But he was just saying female.

1526
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:37,600
Real female!

1527
01:07:46,340 --> 01:07:47,460
Thank you.

1528
01:07:48,740 --> 01:07:51,180
Oh my god, you made a suit in my size?

1529
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:58,460
It's so difficult finding a shirt that doesn't rip because of these guns.

1530
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:13,440
Yeah, but it's better down here!

1531
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:17,940
We get free food and entertainment and you'll never have to work again!

1532
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:26,600
Welcome to the gun show.

1533
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:31,460
Where's my new home?

1534
01:08:32,740 --> 01:08:34,660
Oh my god, we're gonna get Disney'd.

1535
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:40,780
Just step in here and put your vault suit on.

1536
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:41,240
Alright.

1537
01:08:41,780 --> 01:08:42,940
In front of everybody?

1538
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:44,780
I mean, I'm not shy or anything.

1539
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:50,860
I'm very confident about my body.

1540
01:08:56,780 --> 01:08:58,680
I worked hard for it.

1541
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:04,220
The pod will decontaminate and depressurize you before we head deeper in the vault.

1542
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:07,120
You'll live a whole new life.

1543
01:09:08,860 --> 01:09:09,800
Did I change?

1544
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,300
The Doughkeeper and Fart of Swoltech.

1545
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:14,120
Thank you for the super chat, Tom.

1546
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:15,120
Thank you, thank you.

1547
01:09:22,670 --> 01:09:26,870
Oh shit, I looked down instead of at my husband and child.

1548
01:09:39,610 --> 01:09:40,130
Hello?

1549
01:09:42,110 --> 01:09:44,830
Don't worry, don't unfreeze me like they'll unfreeze Disney.

1550
01:09:55,690 --> 01:09:56,210
Hello?

1551
01:09:57,750 --> 01:09:59,210
Oh my gosh, I'm looking up again.

1552
01:10:00,390 --> 01:10:01,830
That... that my husband?

1553
01:10:10,780 --> 01:10:13,240
Oh my god, we're gonna be let go early.

1554
01:10:15,620 --> 01:10:17,680
Is it time to repopulate the world?

1555
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:19,220
Are we going to the surface?

1556
01:10:31,990 --> 01:10:33,070
Give him the child!

1557
01:10:33,710 --> 01:10:35,530
His fucking arms are sticks!

1558
01:10:35,710 --> 01:10:37,370
How can you not pull off the child?

1559
01:10:37,370 --> 01:10:38,710
I'm gonna give it to you, Sean!

1560
01:10:42,150 --> 01:10:43,570
Oh, he's dead.

1561
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:50,160
Sean!

1562
01:10:52,260 --> 01:10:53,580
Clio Genic Seed.

1563
01:10:54,060 --> 01:10:55,320
Wait, I'm the backup?

1564
01:10:58,220 --> 01:11:05,180
Look, all I'm saying is if my husband invests in 10 points of strength, that wouldn't have happened.

1565
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:07,520
I'm not gonna let you do that.

1566
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:09,000
I'm not gonna let you do that.

1567
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:11,240
That's all I'm saying.

1568
01:11:11,340 --> 01:11:13,080
He invested in the wrong thing.

1569
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:16,680
If he was a fucking lawyer, he could have survived.

1570
01:11:21,230 --> 01:11:22,770
I'm only a Plan B.

1571
01:11:22,790 --> 01:11:23,750
I can't believe it.

1572
01:11:23,790 --> 01:11:26,490
I worked so hard on these guns.

1573
01:11:28,770 --> 01:11:29,290
Oh!

1574
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:37,080
He could have taken... exactly, he could have taken the bullet.

1575
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:38,440
Cause I might...

1576
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:39,560
Hello?

1577
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:42,460
There has to be... a room.

1578
01:11:42,460 --> 01:11:43,480
How do I release it?

1579
01:11:43,660 --> 01:11:44,620
Wait, how are you dead?

1580
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:47,440
Wait, the rest are dead as well?

1581
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:50,320
Wait, how are all the rest of you dead?

1582
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:54,400
Wait, there's nobody in this one.

1583
01:11:56,060 --> 01:12:00,700
Wait, there's only... 2, 4, 6, 8 pods?

1584
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:03,720
How did you guys die?

1585
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:07,160
Open!

1586
01:12:09,980 --> 01:12:10,500
Open!

1587
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:11,820
I can't do manual release?

1588
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:13,740
The freezer broke?

1589
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:15,740
But how did I live through the freezer?

1590
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:22,400
Oh, they li- the life support failed, but I lived.

1591
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:26,440
That's why you should have invested in 10 in strength, guys.

1592
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:27,660
They didn't.

1593
01:12:27,660 --> 01:12:29,100
I lived because of that.

1594
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:36,760
They didn't.

1595
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:37,140
You're all dead.

1596
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:39,460
Alright, they didn't invest in 10 strength.

1597
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:41,240
Typica.

1598
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:44,920
Let's transfer.

1599
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:45,940
Oh!

1600
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:48,420
Wait, did I not wear my suit yet?

1601
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:50,420
Oh, I must not have worn my suit.

1602
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:51,380
I didn't realize.

1603
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:53,400
What is my outfit?

1604
01:12:55,020 --> 01:12:56,940
How do I look at my inventory?

1605
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:01,060
How do I look at my inventory, guys?

1606
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:04,480
What's the inventory tab?

1607
01:13:04,820 --> 01:13:06,260
All I can do is quick save.

1608
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:09,800
So fucking weak.

1609
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:12,580
Is it tab?

1610
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:13,480
It's not tab.

1611
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:15,200
I can't open my inventory.

1612
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:16,900
Oh, I can't yet.

1613
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:18,640
Am I actually wearing it?

1614
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:19,660
Oh, I am wearing it.

1615
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:22,380
I am wearing it.

1616
01:13:22,420 --> 01:13:23,440
They just all watched me.

1617
01:13:23,540 --> 01:13:25,380
Oh, there's a Radroach.

1618
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:30,180
They all just watched me change in front of them.

1619
01:13:30,940 --> 01:13:31,780
Security terminal.

1620
01:13:33,260 --> 01:13:34,720
Welcome to Robco industry.

1621
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:36,060
Welcome to Robco industry.

1622
01:13:37,100 --> 01:13:37,780
Uh...

1623
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:44,520
Vault 111 is designed to test the long-term effects of suspended animation on unaware human subjects.

1624
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:45,420
That's me!

1625
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:46,180
I'm unaware!

1626
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:52,760
Security staff are responsible for maintaining installation integrity and monitoring science staff activity.

1627
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:57,260
Under no circumstances are staff allowed to deviate from assigned duties.

1628
01:13:57,460 --> 01:14:01,360
Insubordination or interference with vault operations are capital offenses.

1629
01:14:02,060 --> 01:14:04,700
Security staff are authorized to use lethal weapons.

1630
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:05,500
Security staff are authorized to use lethal weapons.

1631
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:07,920
All right, what about the...

1632
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:10,920
security logs?

1633
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,000
What's the latest one?

1634
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:14,440
Last entry.

1635
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:16,920
No all clear from Vault Tech is coming.

1636
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:17,700
We need to leave.

1637
01:14:17,780 --> 01:14:19,040
We're all but out of food.

1638
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:22,980
Almost murdered Stanley for dropping a damned salt cracker on the floor.

1639
01:14:23,180 --> 01:14:26,320
A handful of us confronted the overseer about opening up the vault.

1640
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:29,600
I never knew a man that small could shout that loud.

1641
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:33,920
Now he's locked himself in his office along with the rest of the science staff.

1642
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:49,000
Oh!

1643
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,560
Okay, so everybody just left.

1644
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:53,080
What date is it today?

1645
01:14:53,820 --> 01:14:56,260
Okay, so everybody left at like, 78.

1646
01:14:56,780 --> 01:14:58,700
They ran out of supplies in 78?

1647
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:00,840
That's fucking crazy!

1648
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:05,820
I thought like... all clear and evacuation.

1649
01:15:06,980 --> 01:15:07,500
Okay.

1650
01:15:09,820 --> 01:15:10,920
What is this?

1651
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:13,560
Vault-Tec is classified short term.

1652
01:15:13,660 --> 01:15:14,740
Oh, it's a short term.

1653
01:15:14,860 --> 01:15:15,480
Yeah, I was gonna say.

1654
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:18,620
Oh, it's been 200 years.

1655
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:19,260
Okay.

1656
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:25,660
In absence of an all clear message from Vault-Tec, the overseer may elect to evacuate staff after a mandatory shelter.

1657
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:26,820
They left?

1658
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:28,600
Yeah, they left after only two years.

1659
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:30,960
There's only supplies for two years?

1660
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:34,900
How do I open my husband's thing?

1661
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:36,820
I'm gonna rob him.

1662
01:15:42,620 --> 01:15:43,900
Where is it?

1663
01:15:43,940 --> 01:15:45,660
Is there no instructions to open it?

1664
01:15:47,860 --> 01:15:51,020
Yeah, it only like, survived for two years.

1665
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:53,340
That's crazy.

1666
01:15:54,940 --> 01:15:57,080
Wait, the control panel is next to his pod?

1667
01:15:57,300 --> 01:15:58,300
Guys, I need to go back.

1668
01:15:58,600 --> 01:15:59,340
Wait, what's this?

1669
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:00,120
I'm gonna sit down.

1670
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:01,540
I need to rest my legs.

1671
01:16:01,740 --> 01:16:02,980
I worked only on my arms.

1672
01:16:06,660 --> 01:16:10,200
I didn't realize I could open his pod as well.

1673
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:12,500
Because I couldn't open my own.

1674
01:16:12,820 --> 01:16:14,380
I couldn't open the others.

1675
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:17,440
Alright, time to rob my husband.

1676
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:19,520
Look, it's technically mine.

1677
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:24,480
See, because I couldn't open these, so I assumed I could open his.

1678
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:25,760
Alright, what do you have?

1679
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:29,760
Oh, I got the wedding ring.

1680
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:30,340
Nice.

1681
01:16:30,380 --> 01:16:31,280
I can sell it for money.

1682
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:34,500
Thank you.

1683
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:36,100
Thank you, dead husband.

1684
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:37,260
Nice.

1685
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:40,460
Now I can have extra income in the wastelands.

1686
01:16:42,540 --> 01:16:43,900
It's technically mine!

1687
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:46,020
We shared bank accounts.

1688
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:49,880
Alright.

1689
01:16:51,860 --> 01:16:52,700
Easy money.

1690
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:55,580
Oh shit, it's time.

1691
01:16:57,700 --> 01:16:58,580
It's time.

1692
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:00,500
This is what I've been training for.

1693
01:17:00,540 --> 01:17:01,180
Get over here.

1694
01:17:06,180 --> 01:17:07,320
Doki smash.

1695
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:14,420
There's no banks in them.

1696
01:17:14,740 --> 01:17:16,760
Yeah, that's called inheriting.

1697
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:21,480
This is exactly why I put ten in straight.

1698
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:24,460
Doki smash.

1699
01:17:26,020 --> 01:17:26,700
Where's more?

1700
01:17:26,820 --> 01:17:27,260
I'm ready.

1701
01:17:27,780 --> 01:17:30,040
I'm gonna try and take as many stuff I can.

1702
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:34,040
I can carry a lot too, because I have like, I've maxed out.

1703
01:17:35,100 --> 01:17:36,280
Uh, overseer memo.

1704
01:17:37,220 --> 01:17:39,680
Remember, use of the recreation terminal is a privilege.

1705
01:17:39,860 --> 01:17:42,660
If work performances decline, this privilege may be revoked.

1706
01:17:42,740 --> 01:17:43,820
Enjoy responsibly.

1707
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:45,960
Uh, oh play tape.

1708
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:50,660
Oh, I get to play a game?

1709
01:17:50,660 --> 01:17:54,240
What the fuck is- oh is this like Donkey Kong?

1710
01:17:57,240 --> 01:18:02,100
Wait, I just realized who the enemy is.

1711
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:12,700
I gotta save, I gotta save my woman.

1712
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:16,380
I got- Wee.

1713
01:18:18,380 --> 01:18:19,180
Wee.

1714
01:18:19,180 --> 01:18:19,820
Wee.

1715
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:21,400
I did it!

1716
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:23,040
Yay!

1717
01:18:25,540 --> 01:18:26,660
Okay, let's leave.

1718
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:30,380
This is top ten.

1719
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:31,180
What is this?

1720
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:32,280
Alright.

1721
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:36,200
Oh, I know.

1722
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:39,320
I just didn't think I'd get there that fast.

1723
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:43,020
Oh, wait, I can drink beer?

1724
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:48,380
Is there any negative- Guys, is there any negative effects to drinking alcohol?

1725
01:18:48,380 --> 01:18:49,400
No, right?

1726
01:18:49,540 --> 01:18:51,260
I keep accidentally sitting down.

1727
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:51,940
I'm so tired.

1728
01:18:53,620 --> 01:18:55,660
Okay, I can take- I can keep the game?

1729
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:56,060
How?

1730
01:18:57,560 --> 01:18:58,740
How do I take it?

1731
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:01,120
Okay.

1732
01:19:01,180 --> 01:19:01,760
Oops, sorry.

1733
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:04,040
Uh...

1734
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:06,940
Play tape.

1735
01:19:07,180 --> 01:19:08,040
Oh, eject it.

1736
01:19:08,140 --> 01:19:08,420
Okay.

1737
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:12,200
How do I- No, I can't.

1738
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:13,640
It won't let me eject it.

1739
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:16,540
It doesn't let me.

1740
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:21,160
It says- Uh... I tried.

1741
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:22,500
It says- Oh, there it is.

1742
01:19:22,660 --> 01:19:23,580
Oh, there you go!

1743
01:19:23,660 --> 01:19:24,160
I did it!

1744
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:25,220
I had to, like, leave.

1745
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:26,460
Alright.

1746
01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:26,860
Nice.

1747
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:28,300
Is there anything in the fridge?

1748
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:29,800
I guess not.

1749
01:19:34,310 --> 01:19:35,110
Any radroaches?

1750
01:19:37,210 --> 01:19:38,370
Any radroaches around?

1751
01:19:39,110 --> 01:19:39,510
No?

1752
01:19:39,610 --> 01:19:41,710
Does no one have any items for me to steal?

1753
01:19:42,650 --> 01:19:43,790
I can't believe it!

1754
01:19:45,170 --> 01:19:47,290
Alright, time to beat up some more radroaches.

1755
01:19:47,910 --> 01:19:48,310
Hello?

1756
01:19:48,310 --> 01:19:48,470
Hello?

1757
01:19:50,030 --> 01:19:50,390
Radroaches?

1758
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:55,150
Ah!

1759
01:19:55,150 --> 01:19:55,830
There you go.

1760
01:19:55,970 --> 01:19:56,590
Oh, shit!

1761
01:19:56,670 --> 01:19:56,830
Ow!

1762
01:19:56,950 --> 01:19:57,230
That hurts!

1763
01:19:57,350 --> 01:19:58,270
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

1764
01:19:58,850 --> 01:19:59,650
Sorry, I forgot.

1765
01:19:59,950 --> 01:20:00,530
Electricity hurts.

1766
01:20:02,530 --> 01:20:03,250
Doki smash!

1767
01:20:04,170 --> 01:20:04,850
There you go.

1768
01:20:05,130 --> 01:20:05,490
Nice.

1769
01:20:05,710 --> 01:20:06,410
Oh, do you have stuff?

1770
01:20:07,710 --> 01:20:08,470
Press the block.

1771
01:20:08,550 --> 01:20:09,270
Oh, I need a block!

1772
01:20:09,690 --> 01:20:11,110
Okay, I'm gonna block the electricity.

1773
01:20:13,250 --> 01:20:13,610
Okay.

1774
01:20:15,370 --> 01:20:15,890
Okay.

1775
01:20:16,110 --> 01:20:16,370
Okay.

1776
01:20:16,550 --> 01:20:17,830
Still can't eat yet.

1777
01:20:20,110 --> 01:20:21,010
It's this way.

1778
01:20:21,250 --> 01:20:22,190
Does that mean there's stuff here?

1779
01:20:24,130 --> 01:20:27,310
Press hold lower alt to power attack.

1780
01:20:28,330 --> 01:20:29,090
Oh, okay.

1781
01:20:29,190 --> 01:20:30,710
Power attack is left alt.

1782
01:20:30,790 --> 01:20:31,450
That's such a...

1783
01:20:31,450 --> 01:20:34,050
That's such a terrible button.

1784
01:20:34,770 --> 01:20:35,950
For power attack.

1785
01:20:36,750 --> 01:20:38,810
I'm gonna change that, actually.

1786
01:20:39,210 --> 01:20:39,730
Alright.

1787
01:20:39,970 --> 01:20:40,790
Quick save.

1788
01:20:40,930 --> 01:20:43,010
I need to, like, know what quick save is.

1789
01:20:43,730 --> 01:20:44,210
Alright.

1790
01:20:44,450 --> 01:20:45,270
Mouse 1.

1791
01:20:45,650 --> 01:20:46,590
Left alt.

1792
01:20:46,890 --> 01:20:48,450
Alright, I'm gonna put that as mouse 4.

1793
01:20:49,490 --> 01:20:52,350
Uh... I can't... I don't have a Pip-Boy yet, and that's why.

1794
01:20:52,530 --> 01:20:53,650
Do I not have a Pip-Boy?

1795
01:20:54,930 --> 01:20:55,410
Okay.

1796
01:20:55,410 --> 01:20:55,890
Sneak.

1797
01:20:56,030 --> 01:20:56,810
Quick save.

1798
01:20:56,970 --> 01:20:58,950
Quick save, I'm gonna make it...

1799
01:21:00,230 --> 01:21:01,870
This button is reserved?

1800
01:21:02,030 --> 01:21:03,130
What is it reserved for?

1801
01:21:03,910 --> 01:21:05,810
I don't have it reserved for anything!

1802
01:21:06,090 --> 01:21:06,350
Oh!

1803
01:21:07,890 --> 01:21:08,850
Oh, okay.

1804
01:21:09,050 --> 01:21:09,750
You know what?

1805
01:21:09,850 --> 01:21:12,090
I'm gonna put quick save as this.

1806
01:21:12,090 --> 01:21:12,850
Wait.

1807
01:21:13,070 --> 01:21:13,510
What?

1808
01:21:13,750 --> 01:21:14,170
Okay.

1809
01:21:15,730 --> 01:21:19,010
Uh... I'm gonna put that back in left alt.

1810
01:21:19,610 --> 01:21:22,510
And then I'm gonna put that here.

1811
01:21:23,930 --> 01:21:24,410
Wait.

1812
01:21:24,410 --> 01:21:26,210
What's... Wait, I can't do it!

1813
01:21:26,330 --> 01:21:27,210
It won't let me.

1814
01:21:28,230 --> 01:21:28,710
No!

1815
01:21:29,970 --> 01:21:31,490
It won't let me!

1816
01:21:33,270 --> 01:21:33,750
Okay.

1817
01:21:34,510 --> 01:21:35,930
I'm just gonna put it here, then.

1818
01:21:37,270 --> 01:21:39,870
I'm just not... I'm just gonna do it the other way.

1819
01:21:44,890 --> 01:21:45,370
Smash!

1820
01:21:45,370 --> 01:21:46,090
Oh, no.

1821
01:21:46,370 --> 01:21:48,030
A little bit of radiation doesn't hurt.

1822
01:21:48,630 --> 01:21:49,350
It's fine.

1823
01:21:49,510 --> 01:21:51,270
It's like... It's like eating a banana.

1824
01:21:52,230 --> 01:21:53,290
I'm a little hydrated.

1825
01:21:53,470 --> 01:21:54,350
Stay hydrated, everybody!

1826
01:21:55,790 --> 01:21:56,270
Alright.

1827
01:21:56,350 --> 01:21:56,790
I'm okay.

1828
01:21:58,770 --> 01:21:59,250
Gun!

1829
01:22:00,690 --> 01:22:01,510
This is it!

1830
01:22:08,140 --> 01:22:08,620
Alright.

1831
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:09,240
Let's see.

1832
01:22:09,460 --> 01:22:09,940
Vault.

1833
01:22:10,220 --> 01:22:11,040
Overseer instructions.

1834
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:12,680
Overseer's log.

1835
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:15,260
Uh... Mutiny.

1836
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:16,340
I wanna know about the mutiny.

1837
01:22:16,620 --> 01:22:19,220
A faction led by the security personnel have taken...

1838
01:22:19,220 --> 01:22:20,620
have turned on me.

1839
01:22:20,900 --> 01:22:22,860
Demanding they be allowed to leave the vault.

1840
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:23,640
Idiots!

1841
01:22:23,660 --> 01:22:25,620
I will not open the door to be eradic...

1842
01:22:25,620 --> 01:22:27,420
eradicated to death out there.

1843
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:31,200
I'm consolidating the remaining supplies.

1844
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:32,660
Putting the staff on lockdown.

1845
01:22:33,020 --> 01:22:35,500
We're going to have to... start practicing.

1846
01:22:35,660 --> 01:22:37,320
Who deserves what little food we have left?

1847
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:39,640
I've been too damn generous with the rations.

1848
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:42,720
If people don't like it, well, that's for your mouths to feed.

1849
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:46,160
Just let them out!

1850
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:47,060
They're gonna die off.

1851
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:48,300
They're gonna die anyway!

1852
01:22:49,220 --> 01:22:49,580
Let them...

1853
01:22:49,580 --> 01:22:52,140
Oh, I guess they don't want to open the vault door because then...

1854
01:22:52,140 --> 01:22:53,840
like everybody else is gonna get radiation.

1855
01:22:54,260 --> 01:22:55,800
Then fucking sit in the cryo chamber!

1856
01:22:57,020 --> 01:22:58,060
A little bit.

1857
01:22:58,300 --> 01:22:59,080
You might as well.

1858
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:03,700
Wait, I wanna hear about the system's malfunctioning.

1859
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:06,740
Strange issue today with Pod C3.

1860
01:23:06,860 --> 01:23:08,800
Subject appeared to be having heart palpitations.

1861
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:10,880
Nothing life threatening, but unusual.

1862
01:23:11,340 --> 01:23:13,940
Realized almost too late that the pod was malfunctioning.

1863
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:16,860
The cryogenic array almost started thawing her out.

1864
01:23:16,860 --> 01:23:20,960
We're not sure, but I suspect the hiccup involved tech's remote override systems.

1865
01:23:21,180 --> 01:23:23,040
May have sent an errant signal.

1866
01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:28,060
But to keep an eye out, I only hope their systems are reliable once we evacuate the staff.

1867
01:23:28,740 --> 01:23:29,300
Okay.

1868
01:23:30,180 --> 01:23:30,980
Let's see.

1869
01:23:31,140 --> 01:23:32,540
Open evacuation tunnel.

1870
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:33,920
Alright.

1871
01:23:34,780 --> 01:23:35,560
Open it!

1872
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:36,400
Open, open!

1873
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:38,300
What about this?

1874
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:40,880
Okay.

1875
01:23:41,460 --> 01:23:42,020
What's...

1876
01:23:42,020 --> 01:23:43,580
Oh, that's the one we read earlier.

1877
01:23:43,620 --> 01:23:43,840
Yeah.

1878
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:44,960
Alright.

1879
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:45,260
Yay!

1880
01:23:45,260 --> 01:23:46,820
We opened it.

1881
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:48,520
Gun!

1882
01:23:48,640 --> 01:23:49,280
More gun!

1883
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:51,700
How do we unlock this?

1884
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:53,760
I want it now.

1885
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:55,840
Okay, wait.

1886
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:57,060
What the fuck?

1887
01:23:58,140 --> 01:23:59,140
How do I...

1888
01:23:59,140 --> 01:24:00,980
Wait, I can change my POV?

1889
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:03,440
How do I change my POV?

1890
01:24:03,620 --> 01:24:04,520
Guys, how do...

1891
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:06,540
Oh, it's middle mouse button.

1892
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:09,500
Should I play as like...

1893
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:12,240
Should I play third person or first person, guys?

1894
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:14,420
I need lockpick?

1895
01:24:16,380 --> 01:24:16,820
Okay.

1896
01:24:16,940 --> 01:24:17,300
Okay.

1897
01:24:18,180 --> 01:24:19,060
Which is better?

1898
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:22,560
Third person or first person?

1899
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:28,300
I can get it with dog meat?

1900
01:24:28,460 --> 01:24:29,000
Oh, nice.

1901
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:29,340
Okay.

1902
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:29,820
That's good.

1903
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:31,340
I almost forgot the stims.

1904
01:24:32,740 --> 01:24:34,820
And can be favored for quick use.

1905
01:24:34,980 --> 01:24:35,280
Okay.

1906
01:24:37,720 --> 01:24:40,460
I have no idea if I want to play third or first person.

1907
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:41,640
Do we want to look at her more?

1908
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:44,760
Alright.

1909
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:46,600
Let's go.

1910
01:24:46,780 --> 01:24:47,220
Let's go.

1911
01:24:47,220 --> 01:24:47,780
Okay.

1912
01:24:47,780 --> 01:24:48,240
Let's see.

1913
01:24:49,140 --> 01:24:50,260
What the fuck?

1914
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:52,020
Okay.

1915
01:24:52,260 --> 01:24:53,540
Wait, what does it look like?

1916
01:24:53,820 --> 01:24:54,340
Okay.

1917
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:56,000
Okay.

1918
01:24:56,020 --> 01:24:58,360
Maybe it's easier to aim in third person.

1919
01:24:58,520 --> 01:24:59,200
Not gonna lie.

1920
01:25:01,420 --> 01:25:02,340
It's like...

1921
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:04,200
It's definitely...

1922
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:04,840
Okay.

1923
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:06,300
Maybe I was wrong.

1924
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:14,880
Maybe I was wrong.

1925
01:25:15,780 --> 01:25:16,300
Okay.

1926
01:25:16,300 --> 01:25:17,160
But I gotta take this.

1927
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:17,200
I'm gonna go.

1928
01:25:17,220 --> 01:25:17,900
It's meat though.

1929
01:25:19,220 --> 01:25:20,440
I hear more.

1930
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:23,560
Okay.

1931
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:25,520
Q for...

1932
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:25,700
Okay.

1933
01:25:25,780 --> 01:25:27,120
I mean, I don't need to reload.

1934
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:28,520
Q for VATS?

1935
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:30,100
It hasn't taught me that yet.

1936
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:31,800
Hello?

1937
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,840
How many doors is there?

1938
01:25:35,020 --> 01:25:35,700
To sneak?

1939
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:38,900
You do increase damage left control.

1940
01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:41,540
Avoid bright light.

1941
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:43,920
There.

1942
01:25:44,380 --> 01:25:45,400
I don't really...

1943
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:46,120
It's one guy.

1944
01:25:47,220 --> 01:25:47,520
Wait.

1945
01:25:48,860 --> 01:25:49,320
Oh!

1946
01:25:52,620 --> 01:25:53,520
Oh shit!

1947
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:54,220
Boom!

1948
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:54,960
There you go.

1949
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:56,580
Ow.

1950
01:25:58,480 --> 01:25:58,940
Alright.

1951
01:25:59,480 --> 01:25:59,980
Oh, Pip-Boy!

1952
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:01,500
Finally I can access my inventory!

1953
01:26:02,260 --> 01:26:03,000
He's dead.

1954
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:03,660
Let's loot him.

1955
01:26:03,740 --> 01:26:05,020
I wanted the forest anyway!

1956
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:06,760
Miracle, thank you for the super chat.

1957
01:26:06,820 --> 01:26:07,100
Thank you.

1958
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:14,420
I can finally access my inventory.

1959
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:21,620
Alright.

1960
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:22,320
Nice!

1961
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:24,080
Got my Pip-Boy!

1962
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:26,360
That's me!

1963
01:26:31,130 --> 01:26:31,650
Alright.

1964
01:26:31,890 --> 01:26:32,630
Let's see.

1965
01:26:32,690 --> 01:26:33,470
I'm level one.

1966
01:26:34,530 --> 01:26:35,970
Uh... Oh, look at me.

1967
01:26:36,770 --> 01:26:37,490
That's me.

1968
01:26:37,930 --> 01:26:41,110
Okay, I got security, baton, apparel.

1969
01:26:41,670 --> 01:26:43,470
Uh, now I'm not married anymore.

1970
01:26:43,590 --> 01:26:43,790
Wait.

1971
01:26:43,990 --> 01:26:45,410
What do I look like without...

1972
01:26:45,930 --> 01:26:47,430
I'm very confident about my body.

1973
01:26:49,630 --> 01:26:50,150
Okay.

1974
01:26:53,470 --> 01:26:53,870
Okay.

1975
01:26:54,050 --> 01:26:55,010
Is there like...

1976
01:26:55,010 --> 01:26:56,050
Perk chart.

1977
01:26:56,550 --> 01:26:56,950
Inspect.

1978
01:26:57,990 --> 01:26:59,570
How many radiation is there?

1979
01:26:59,670 --> 01:27:00,530
It should be fine, right?

1980
01:27:00,650 --> 01:27:01,010
Eleven?

1981
01:27:01,250 --> 01:27:02,050
That should be fine.

1982
01:27:02,090 --> 01:27:02,850
That's like eating a banana.

1983
01:27:04,950 --> 01:27:05,850
Okay, plus eleven.

1984
01:27:05,970 --> 01:27:07,350
That might not be like eating a banana.

1985
01:27:07,690 --> 01:27:08,550
That might not...

1986
01:27:08,550 --> 01:27:08,970
Hahaha!

1987
01:27:12,150 --> 01:27:15,750
Guys, I have a feeling it might not be like eating a banana.

1988
01:27:16,830 --> 01:27:16,910
Hahaha!

1989
01:27:19,330 --> 01:27:19,730
Okay.

1990
01:27:19,730 --> 01:27:21,310
Guys, it's just a little...

1991
01:27:21,310 --> 01:27:22,090
Hahaha!

1992
01:27:22,830 --> 01:27:23,230
Hahaha!

1993
01:27:23,230 --> 01:27:23,250
Hahaha!

1994
01:27:23,250 --> 01:27:23,370
Hahaha!

1995
01:27:23,370 --> 01:27:23,850
Just a little.

1996
01:27:24,710 --> 01:27:27,290
Ooh, look at these fucking arms, bro.

1997
01:27:27,390 --> 01:27:28,570
Oh my god, look at my abs!

1998
01:27:29,250 --> 01:27:30,390
Wait, where's my abs?

1999
01:27:30,730 --> 01:27:30,890
Hahaha!

2000
01:27:31,130 --> 01:27:31,450
Wait!

2001
01:27:33,290 --> 01:27:34,410
Oh, I need to press the button.

2002
01:27:35,830 --> 01:27:40,510
Guys, staying in like cryogenic pause like fucked up my abs, okay guys?

2003
01:27:40,570 --> 01:27:42,270
I just need to be a little bit more dehydrated.

2004
01:27:42,550 --> 01:27:42,870
Chat.

2005
01:27:43,270 --> 01:27:46,730
I don't know if you guys know this, but how abs are like...

2006
01:27:46,730 --> 01:27:51,470
How to get like really pronounced abs, you gotta be like super dehydrated apparently.

2007
01:27:51,930 --> 01:27:53,050
You are cycling sequence.

2008
01:27:53,370 --> 01:27:55,010
You are like a real female.

2009
01:27:55,470 --> 01:27:56,390
Stand back.

2010
01:27:59,080 --> 01:28:00,640
All in the arms.

2011
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:00,960
Hahaha!

2012
01:28:02,260 --> 01:28:03,080
Why am I...

2013
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:05,720
Because I am very confident about my body!

2014
01:28:05,820 --> 01:28:07,340
I worked so hard...

2015
01:28:07,340 --> 01:28:08,420
I was at gym, bro.

2016
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:10,280
I worked so hard for these guys.

2017
01:28:10,680 --> 01:28:11,640
Look at me.

2018
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:12,900
I worked so hard for it.

2019
01:28:13,480 --> 01:28:16,000
I might as well show off my assets.

2020
01:28:21,290 --> 01:28:24,030
Yeah, you need to be like dehydrated and a little...

2021
01:28:24,030 --> 01:28:24,730
Hahaha!

2022
01:28:25,070 --> 01:28:27,170
It's like a little bit starved.

2023
01:28:27,190 --> 01:28:27,530
Hahaha!

2024
01:28:27,550 --> 01:28:29,530
Wait, I can like fall from here?

2025
01:28:30,610 --> 01:28:31,330
Yay!

2026
01:28:31,550 --> 01:28:32,830
The outside world!

2027
01:28:33,530 --> 01:28:34,250
Yay!

2028
01:28:38,410 --> 01:28:39,790
Let me out!

2029
01:28:40,010 --> 01:28:41,170
Let me out!

2030
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:50,140
This is better than Stellar Blade.

2031
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:51,640
Hahaha!

2032
01:28:52,420 --> 01:28:54,820
Do you wanna change anything?

2033
01:28:55,480 --> 01:28:56,960
No, I'm fucking perfect.

2034
01:28:57,960 --> 01:28:58,680
Hahaha!

2035
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:00,280
Hahaha!

2036
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:01,960
I'll take your return to the surface.

2037
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:03,800
And thank you for choosing...

2038
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:05,300
Alright, thank you for the super chat.

2039
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:05,740
Thank you.

2040
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:06,200
Thank you.

2041
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:08,560
Are you interested in any robot companions?

2042
01:29:15,390 --> 01:29:17,110
Welcome to the tomato farm!

2043
01:29:17,170 --> 01:29:17,870
Welcome, welcome.

2044
01:29:18,030 --> 01:29:19,090
I'm fucking perfect.

2045
01:29:20,470 --> 01:29:22,290
Optimal build right there.

2046
01:29:22,590 --> 01:29:24,030
Peak performance, exactly.

2047
01:29:26,730 --> 01:29:27,850
Oh shit, you're right.

2048
01:29:27,910 --> 01:29:29,070
Maybe I should put my clothes back on.

2049
01:29:29,150 --> 01:29:30,050
I forgot about the radiation.

2050
01:29:30,970 --> 01:29:31,470
Hahaha!

2051
01:29:31,470 --> 01:29:31,690
Hahaha!

2052
01:29:34,470 --> 01:29:35,110
Guys...

2053
01:29:35,110 --> 01:29:38,750
I would love to like show off...

2054
01:29:38,750 --> 01:29:40,630
Show off the goods.

2055
01:29:40,930 --> 01:29:43,770
But like I just remembered about radiation.

2056
01:29:44,330 --> 01:29:44,930
Hahaha!

2057
01:29:47,450 --> 01:29:48,870
God's perfect design.

2058
01:29:49,190 --> 01:29:49,830
Exactly.

2059
01:29:52,790 --> 01:29:54,790
Oh look, see the birds are okay.

2060
01:29:55,090 --> 01:29:57,150
Oh nice, there's supplies here.

2061
01:29:57,590 --> 01:29:58,830
There's supplies outside?

2062
01:29:59,210 --> 01:30:00,370
You're supposed to put that inside.

2063
01:30:00,810 --> 01:30:01,450
Oh, nice.

2064
01:30:01,450 --> 01:30:04,510
And this is the last known location of the caravan.

2065
01:30:04,950 --> 01:30:05,550
And this is the last known location of the caravan.

2066
01:30:05,550 --> 01:30:05,870
Okay.

2067
01:30:06,230 --> 01:30:09,190
I don't know which perspective I want to play.

2068
01:30:09,570 --> 01:30:10,070
I don't know which perspective I want to play.

2069
01:30:11,930 --> 01:30:13,910
Okay, we gotta take all this junk here.

2070
01:30:14,370 --> 01:30:15,470
Okay, we gotta take all this junk here.

2071
01:30:15,470 --> 01:30:18,670
Oh, it's to open the vault from down below.

2072
01:30:18,930 --> 01:30:18,950
Oh, it's to open the vault from down below.

2073
01:30:18,950 --> 01:30:19,530
Nice.

2074
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:26,220
Find and kill pyro.

2075
01:30:26,240 --> 01:30:27,540
Start pyromaniac.

2076
01:30:27,540 --> 01:30:28,720
There's so many quests.

2077
01:30:29,100 --> 01:30:30,220
A typewriter?

2078
01:30:30,220 --> 01:30:32,220
What am I gonna do with a typewriter?

2079
01:30:34,420 --> 01:30:35,940
Oh yeah, I bought the DST.

2080
01:30:36,020 --> 01:30:36,740
I told you guys.

2081
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:37,920
I gave Todd all my money.

2082
01:30:39,660 --> 01:30:40,380
Of course.

2083
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:41,720
Like Todd intended.

2084
01:30:43,740 --> 01:30:45,100
Because I believe in him.

2085
01:30:45,340 --> 01:30:46,320
In his dreams.

2086
01:30:46,740 --> 01:30:47,220
Hahaha!

2087
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:50,180
To type-doki.

2088
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:52,160
God, where were you living?

2089
01:30:52,240 --> 01:30:52,780
In a vault?

2090
01:30:54,280 --> 01:30:56,060
Alright, let's steal everything.

2091
01:30:56,360 --> 01:30:56,660
Oh hey!

2092
01:30:56,660 --> 01:30:57,920
Oh, that's a broken...

2093
01:30:58,660 --> 01:30:59,180
system.

2094
01:31:00,900 --> 01:31:02,500
Please stop sitting on chairs!

2095
01:31:02,740 --> 01:31:03,960
Real female doki!

2096
01:31:05,260 --> 01:31:07,100
I think that's gonna be my new name.

2097
01:31:07,260 --> 01:31:07,820
Real female...

2098
01:31:10,620 --> 01:31:11,140
Please!

2099
01:31:11,680 --> 01:31:12,200
Please!

2100
01:31:13,480 --> 01:31:20,420
From doki FPS Vtuber to TV, Facebook, YouTube, to real female doki.

2101
01:31:20,460 --> 01:31:22,200
I think that's gonna be my new name now.

2102
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:22,680
Hahaha!

2103
01:31:25,490 --> 01:31:27,550
Oh, those were all the people that were...

2104
01:31:28,510 --> 01:31:30,210
I like how it taught me how to run now.

2105
01:31:31,110 --> 01:31:32,350
That died outside.

2106
01:31:32,670 --> 01:31:33,350
I wanted...

2107
01:31:33,350 --> 01:31:34,690
Is that a person?

2108
01:31:34,770 --> 01:31:35,370
No, that's a tree.

2109
01:31:35,710 --> 01:31:36,710
That's a fucking tree.

2110
01:31:38,890 --> 01:31:39,330
Okay.

2111
01:31:39,850 --> 01:31:40,690
Where do we go?

2112
01:31:42,030 --> 01:31:43,670
Oh wait, there's a...

2113
01:31:43,670 --> 01:31:45,950
There's a person here to my left.

2114
01:31:47,370 --> 01:31:48,750
I assume we go this way.

2115
01:31:48,990 --> 01:31:50,250
Wait, is this gonna be my future home?

2116
01:31:50,370 --> 01:31:50,870
The sanctuary!

2117
01:31:51,630 --> 01:31:53,090
This is gonna be my new home!

2118
01:31:54,050 --> 01:31:55,770
I'm gonna like rebuild this!

2119
01:31:57,750 --> 01:31:58,190
Oh!

2120
01:31:58,510 --> 01:31:59,230
Let's find Cogsworth!

2121
01:32:00,230 --> 01:32:02,050
Oh my god, I can rob people.

2122
01:32:02,190 --> 01:32:03,470
I've never liked my neighbors anyway.

2123
01:32:04,250 --> 01:32:05,710
That's right, I want that lamp.

2124
01:32:08,110 --> 01:32:10,130
Alright, give me that fucking pot.

2125
01:32:10,610 --> 01:32:11,870
Oh my god, bottle caps!

2126
01:32:12,310 --> 01:32:12,870
We're rich!

2127
01:32:14,250 --> 01:32:15,130
Okay, tin can.

2128
01:32:16,390 --> 01:32:18,050
It's okay, my neighbors are dead.

2129
01:32:18,270 --> 01:32:19,370
It's ethical robbing.

2130
01:32:20,590 --> 01:32:23,210
I'm just being like, you know, the British Museum.

2131
01:32:24,290 --> 01:32:24,790
Hahaha!

2132
01:32:27,590 --> 01:32:28,950
James, thank you for the super chat!

2133
01:32:29,050 --> 01:32:29,650
Thank you, thank you!

2134
01:32:29,690 --> 01:32:30,090
Cogsworth!

2135
01:32:30,830 --> 01:32:31,470
You're alive!

2136
01:32:31,990 --> 01:32:33,690
How did you survive it?

2137
01:32:35,730 --> 01:32:37,490
Oh my god, there's another typewriter.

2138
01:32:37,770 --> 01:32:39,570
Oh, I can customize my gun!

2139
01:32:41,930 --> 01:32:42,330
Uh...

2140
01:32:42,330 --> 01:32:44,670
Short barrel, comfort grip.

2141
01:32:45,730 --> 01:32:46,130
Ooh!

2142
01:32:47,130 --> 01:32:49,290
Adhesive, improved recoil and hip fire.

2143
01:32:49,430 --> 01:32:50,070
You might as well.

2144
01:32:50,090 --> 01:32:51,190
I have everything for it.

2145
01:32:51,430 --> 01:32:54,630
I should not be upgrading my default gun.

2146
01:32:54,850 --> 01:32:55,290
Nevermind.

2147
01:33:00,910 --> 01:33:02,090
It's just a scratch.

2148
01:33:05,170 --> 01:33:06,590
Alright, let's see.

2149
01:33:19,390 --> 01:33:21,090
There's people using the radio.

2150
01:33:24,550 --> 01:33:27,150
Oh my god, they know how to use the radio!

2151
01:33:28,370 --> 01:33:29,290
That's crazy!

2152
01:33:31,030 --> 01:33:31,630
Alright.

2153
01:33:31,910 --> 01:33:33,190
Oh my gosh, my neighbors.

2154
01:33:33,410 --> 01:33:35,030
Why are my neighbors so poor?

2155
01:33:35,310 --> 01:33:36,690
We live in suburbia!

2156
01:33:37,410 --> 01:33:38,730
Oh, nice bobby pins.

2157
01:33:38,950 --> 01:33:40,150
I found bobby pins, guys.

2158
01:33:41,850 --> 01:33:42,270
Nice.

2159
01:33:42,610 --> 01:33:44,450
There's no subtitles for radios, unfortunately.

2160
01:33:44,930 --> 01:33:47,170
Wait, have I turned off, like, motion blur?

2161
01:33:47,730 --> 01:33:48,690
I couldn't tell.

2162
01:33:51,970 --> 01:33:52,810
Gameplay... display.

2163
01:33:53,750 --> 01:33:54,930
Is there motion blur?

2164
01:33:55,070 --> 01:33:55,650
I don't know.

2165
01:33:55,690 --> 01:33:56,530
I think there isn't.

2166
01:33:56,810 --> 01:33:57,230
Hahaha!

2167
01:33:58,670 --> 01:34:00,370
It doesn't see... Oh, there we go!

2168
01:34:00,590 --> 01:34:01,110
Wait, is it?

2169
01:34:01,190 --> 01:34:01,790
No, that's fade.

2170
01:34:02,550 --> 01:34:04,510
I couldn't tell if there's motion blur.

2171
01:34:06,730 --> 01:34:08,050
Alright, let me, like...

2172
01:34:08,050 --> 01:34:11,050
I'm gonna, like, turn my sense a bit lower, though.

2173
01:34:11,190 --> 01:34:12,750
The sense was way too high for me.

2174
01:34:14,750 --> 01:34:15,370
There we go.

2175
01:34:16,450 --> 01:34:16,890
COGSWORTH!

2176
01:34:17,230 --> 01:34:17,870
You're alive!

2177
01:34:20,910 --> 01:34:21,790
It's me!

2178
01:34:25,950 --> 01:34:26,750
Everything's dead!

2179
01:34:27,210 --> 01:34:29,470
We gotta, you know, like, we gotta give it to him straight.

2180
01:34:31,790 --> 01:34:32,490
They did it.

2181
01:34:33,370 --> 01:34:34,550
All that fighting.

2182
01:34:34,730 --> 01:34:35,590
And for what?

2183
01:34:37,050 --> 01:34:37,850
Everything's dead.

2184
01:34:38,210 --> 01:34:39,090
Everything's dead?

2185
01:34:39,470 --> 01:34:40,590
Ah, yes.

2186
01:34:40,750 --> 01:34:41,550
The garden.

2187
01:34:42,010 --> 01:34:45,670
The posies have been problematic, I admit.

2188
01:34:46,230 --> 01:34:49,070
If only sir were here to help.

2189
01:34:49,450 --> 01:34:51,250
Where is he, by the by?

2190
01:34:51,290 --> 01:34:52,290
He's fucking dead!

2191
01:34:53,410 --> 01:34:54,950
He can't be dead.

2192
01:34:55,870 --> 01:34:57,370
Okay, I'm gonna be in denial.

2193
01:34:57,730 --> 01:34:58,450
He can't be.

2194
01:34:58,810 --> 01:35:00,770
He can't be.

2195
01:35:02,490 --> 01:35:04,950
COGSWORTH, going through the five stages of grief right now.

2196
01:35:07,750 --> 01:35:09,350
We can both be in denial.

2197
01:35:16,070 --> 01:35:18,130
Wait, can we actually romance COGSWORTH?

2198
01:35:18,350 --> 01:35:19,870
I know you can romance people in Fallout.

2199
01:35:35,150 --> 01:35:37,670
I know you can.

2200
01:35:38,990 --> 01:35:40,650
They stole him!

2201
01:35:40,910 --> 01:35:42,870
Sean's been kidnapped, COGSWORTH!

2202
01:35:43,030 --> 01:35:44,030
Sean's been kidnapped.

2203
01:35:45,090 --> 01:35:46,310
I'm gonna find him.

2204
01:35:47,210 --> 01:35:48,870
I'm gonna get my baby back.

2205
01:35:49,250 --> 01:35:50,870
It's worse than I thought.

2206
01:35:52,490 --> 01:35:56,030
You're suffering from hunger-induced paranoia.

2207
01:35:56,130 --> 01:35:56,190
You're suffering from hunger-induced paranoia.

2208
01:35:56,190 --> 01:35:57,630
What, from losing my son?

2209
01:35:57,970 --> 01:36:00,350
Two hundred years will do that, I'm afraid.

2210
01:36:02,410 --> 01:36:03,810
Two hundred years will do that, I'm afraid.

2211
01:36:03,810 --> 01:36:04,630
I feel fine.

2212
01:36:04,850 --> 01:36:06,090
I don't know what you're talking about.

2213
01:36:08,250 --> 01:36:10,030
Just a little bit of radiation.

2214
01:36:10,710 --> 01:36:12,130
I feel fine.

2215
01:36:12,350 --> 01:36:15,810
I sort of like ate a little bit of Radroach meat, but it's okay.

2216
01:36:15,890 --> 01:36:16,650
It's like eating a banana.

2217
01:36:26,420 --> 01:36:27,680
You can make me food?

2218
01:36:28,100 --> 01:36:29,020
You can make me food?

2219
01:36:29,020 --> 01:36:29,940
How do you have food?

2220
01:36:30,420 --> 01:36:31,080
Wait, you okay?

2221
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:32,240
Why is it yellow?

2222
01:36:32,860 --> 01:36:34,720
People would withhold information.

2223
01:36:34,720 --> 01:36:37,320
You can attempt to persuade them into sharing both.

2224
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:38,180
Okay, you okay.

2225
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:39,600
COGSWORTH, you're acting...

2226
01:36:40,940 --> 01:36:41,380
A little easy.

2227
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:43,300
Orange, medium, red, hard.

2228
01:36:43,480 --> 01:36:43,880
Oh, okay.

2229
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:46,580
Look at that!

2230
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:47,720
One persuasion!

2231
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:53,460
One charisma, and I'm okay.

2232
01:36:57,920 --> 01:36:59,680
Persuade with that one charisma.

2233
01:37:02,780 --> 01:37:08,940
Oh my god, he just wants to serve.

2234
01:37:09,540 --> 01:37:10,680
That's all he wants.

2235
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:15,300
The futility of dusting a collapsed house.

2236
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:20,980
Trust me.

2237
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:22,060
So true!

2238
01:37:22,420 --> 01:37:23,320
Look at you!

2239
01:37:23,540 --> 01:37:25,920
You couldn't even polish yourself!

2240
01:37:28,100 --> 01:37:29,200
What do you know?

2241
01:37:29,400 --> 01:37:30,340
What do you know, Codsworth?

2242
01:37:31,120 --> 01:37:31,600
I'm a...

2243
01:37:33,640 --> 01:37:36,340
The bombs came and all of you...

2244
01:37:38,580 --> 01:37:41,220
I thought for certain you and your family were...

2245
01:37:41,220 --> 01:37:44,120
A little radiation soup as a treat.

2246
01:37:44,300 --> 01:37:45,520
Jay, thank you for the super chat!

2247
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:45,800
Thank you!

2248
01:37:46,340 --> 01:37:50,440
I thought the sir was going to present it to you as a surprise.

2249
01:37:51,140 --> 01:37:51,940
But then...

2250
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:52,640
Well...

2251
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:54,680
Everything happened!

2252
01:37:56,100 --> 01:37:57,340
Wait, holotape?

2253
01:37:58,540 --> 01:37:59,780
A holotape?

2254
01:37:59,980 --> 01:38:00,920
Yeah, what's on it?

2255
01:38:01,080 --> 01:38:03,520
I believe it's a private message for you.

2256
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:08,040
My etiquette protocols would not permit me to play it for myself.

2257
01:38:08,380 --> 01:38:12,400
Any standard holotape reading device should be able to play it back.

2258
01:38:12,680 --> 01:38:14,880
Oh, like that Pip-Boy on your arm.

2259
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:16,740
That should work brilliantly.

2260
01:38:17,180 --> 01:38:19,860
Now, enough feeling sorry for myself.

2261
01:38:20,220 --> 01:38:22,100
Shall we search the neighborhood together?

2262
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:24,880
Sir and young Sean may turn up yet.

2263
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:25,140
Yeah.

2264
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:27,600
No.

2265
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:31,160
No.

2266
01:38:31,160 --> 01:38:32,080
Okay, yes.

2267
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:33,820
Yeah, I need...

2268
01:38:33,820 --> 01:38:35,220
I need a companion for now.

2269
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:38,120
I need him to tank damage for me.

2270
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:41,040
No.

2271
01:38:41,700 --> 01:38:43,300
Don't get near me.

2272
01:38:43,680 --> 01:38:45,160
Where is the...

2273
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:47,320
From the map, select map marker.

2274
01:38:47,720 --> 01:38:50,980
With to fast travel to hold to drag to view.

2275
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:52,900
Anywhere on the map, add a custom marker.

2276
01:38:53,140 --> 01:38:54,440
Where is the holotape?

2277
01:38:54,540 --> 01:38:55,740
Where do I look at that?

2278
01:38:57,180 --> 01:38:57,680
Radio...

2279
01:38:59,360 --> 01:38:59,860
Umm...

2280
01:39:00,900 --> 01:39:02,080
Is this Hi Honey?

2281
01:39:02,600 --> 01:39:03,420
Is it this?

2282
01:39:14,700 --> 01:39:16,720
Why the fuck did you give me this tape?

2283
01:39:17,640 --> 01:39:19,780
I'm already going through trauma, Cogsworth!

2284
01:39:21,540 --> 01:39:23,060
Can I rob my own house?

2285
01:39:24,040 --> 01:39:24,540
Nice.

2286
01:39:32,410 --> 01:39:32,870
Nice!

2287
01:39:41,370 --> 01:39:42,110
Oh my god.

2288
01:39:42,130 --> 01:39:43,130
Please stop sitting on chairs.

2289
01:39:46,840 --> 01:39:47,980
I can't believe...

2290
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:48,300
I can't believe it.

2291
01:39:49,740 --> 01:39:50,940
I'm coming, sweetheart.

2292
01:39:51,540 --> 01:39:52,900
Bro, he's fucking dead.

2293
01:39:52,980 --> 01:39:53,580
What do you mean?

2294
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:59,420
I can't believe... I can't believe Cogsworth gave me more trauma.

2295
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:01,200
I was trying to fucking move on.

2296
01:40:01,580 --> 01:40:03,620
I don't understand, Cogsworth.

2297
01:40:03,720 --> 01:40:05,100
Why would you do this to me?

2298
01:40:05,260 --> 01:40:07,140
After everything I've been through.

2299
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:12,280
Feels fucking bad, mom.

2300
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:18,980
Alright, we gotta...

2301
01:40:18,980 --> 01:40:19,840
Oh, there's more?

2302
01:40:20,140 --> 01:40:21,020
Did I not loot everything?

2303
01:40:21,340 --> 01:40:22,020
Oh wait, there is!

2304
01:40:22,780 --> 01:40:24,840
No, that is just a baby rattle.

2305
01:40:24,900 --> 01:40:25,400
That's money!

2306
01:40:25,660 --> 01:40:27,560
I can sell Sean's baby rattle.

2307
01:40:27,720 --> 01:40:32,380
I'm gonna sell everything that I've owned of Sean so like I can move on.

2308
01:40:32,700 --> 01:40:33,760
That's so healthy.

2309
01:40:34,580 --> 01:40:38,220
As long as like I pretend he never existed, I'll be okay.

2310
01:40:38,440 --> 01:40:40,680
I'll just sell every little reminder I have of him.

2311
01:40:41,360 --> 01:40:43,700
The books is on the... Did I miss the book again?

2312
01:40:44,100 --> 01:40:44,800
Did I...

2313
01:40:45,940 --> 01:40:48,220
Okay, where the fuck... Is that one right?

2314
01:40:48,500 --> 01:40:50,060
I couldn't... You're special!

2315
01:40:51,560 --> 01:40:52,440
Where's strength?

2316
01:40:53,660 --> 01:40:54,780
I like...

2317
01:40:54,780 --> 01:40:57,860
I like how it won't let me improve my strength anymore.

2318
01:40:59,040 --> 01:41:03,200
Alright, I guess we'll do a little bit of charisma.

2319
01:41:03,380 --> 01:41:04,400
I guess.

2320
01:41:04,820 --> 01:41:07,040
I'll do a little bit of charisma, chat.

2321
01:41:08,540 --> 01:41:10,780
Can't improve past 10.

2322
01:41:11,100 --> 01:41:12,620
No more strength.

2323
01:41:13,320 --> 01:41:16,600
Why would I even let me improve my strength?

2324
01:41:21,080 --> 01:41:22,260
Oh, dog bull.

2325
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:23,260
Stop sitting!

2326
01:41:26,120 --> 01:41:26,900
I'm sad.

2327
01:41:27,100 --> 01:41:27,740
I keep sitting.

2328
01:41:29,080 --> 01:41:30,480
I keep fucking sitting.

2329
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:32,760
My legs are tired.

2330
01:41:33,640 --> 01:41:34,740
Oh, Nuka-Cola.

2331
01:41:34,980 --> 01:41:35,700
Nuka-Cola.

2332
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:37,000
Bolt fly.

2333
01:41:37,280 --> 01:41:37,780
Oh god.

2334
01:41:38,660 --> 01:41:40,300
There's way too much radiation.

2335
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:50,900
I don't remember the concept, but like back then, like, cause you know how like in prehistoric times, um, the bugs were like huge, but then... I think it's like to deal with like temperature or something?

2336
01:41:51,180 --> 01:41:51,980
Oh shit!

2337
01:41:52,060 --> 01:41:52,700
How do I do this?

2338
01:41:53,080 --> 01:41:57,200
But like, more years passed by, the smaller the insects got.

2339
01:41:59,400 --> 01:42:01,400
Uh... Use A to turn the screwdriver.

2340
01:42:02,160 --> 01:42:04,100
If you spot... The spot is too chosen.

2341
01:42:04,200 --> 01:42:06,080
The lock will rotate and open.

2342
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:08,320
If the lock resets, release A and reposition.

2343
01:42:08,440 --> 01:42:09,280
How do I do this?

2344
01:42:09,280 --> 01:42:09,640
...

2345
01:42:12,260 --> 01:42:12,860
...

2346
01:42:12,860 --> 01:42:13,980
...

2347
01:42:16,760 --> 01:42:17,780
Oh, there you go.

2348
01:42:17,960 --> 01:42:18,400
Ah!

2349
01:42:18,540 --> 01:42:19,020
I did it!

2350
01:42:19,080 --> 01:42:19,660
I'm so smart!

2351
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:20,180
...

2352
01:42:21,860 --> 01:42:22,460
Nice!

2353
01:42:22,620 --> 01:42:23,280
Oh gosh.

2354
01:42:23,540 --> 01:42:24,660
There was like...

2355
01:42:24,660 --> 01:42:25,480
Oh, there was more!

2356
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:28,160
There's so many items!

2357
01:42:28,700 --> 01:42:29,300
...

2358
01:42:30,620 --> 01:42:31,220
Oxygen!

2359
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:31,740
Ah!

2360
01:42:33,120 --> 01:42:35,200
There isn't enough oxygen now.

2361
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:36,080
That's great!

2362
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:37,520
Thank... See?

2363
01:42:38,340 --> 01:42:39,020
Deforestation!

2364
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:40,520
...

2365
01:42:40,520 --> 01:42:41,000
...

2366
01:42:42,180 --> 01:42:42,860
...

2367
01:42:45,460 --> 01:42:46,820
... Finally!

2368
01:42:47,500 --> 01:42:47,980
...

2369
01:42:47,980 --> 01:42:50,080
It's a good thing!

2370
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:51,240
...

2371
01:42:52,820 --> 01:42:54,040
Thank God!

2372
01:42:54,380 --> 01:42:55,060
...

2373
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:57,960
Alright.

2374
01:42:58,620 --> 01:43:00,180
Finish it, coward!

2375
01:43:00,280 --> 01:43:00,840
Finish what?

2376
01:43:01,180 --> 01:43:02,260
I don't know what you're talking about.

2377
01:43:02,580 --> 01:43:03,980
Got lighter...

2378
01:43:03,980 --> 01:43:07,400
I got these... Oh, I can turn on the... Okay.

2379
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:08,440
I can't turn on the TV.

2380
01:43:09,940 --> 01:43:10,740
Let's see.

2381
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:12,860
More metal trays...

2382
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:14,500
Oh my God!

2383
01:43:14,580 --> 01:43:15,180
A watch!

2384
01:43:16,100 --> 01:43:17,860
I'm gonna loot everything.

2385
01:43:19,220 --> 01:43:20,840
There's so much stuff to loot!

2386
01:43:21,480 --> 01:43:22,540
This is great!

2387
01:43:22,820 --> 01:43:25,100
There's so much ethical robbing I can do.

2388
01:43:27,620 --> 01:43:28,180
Alright.

2389
01:43:28,760 --> 01:43:31,280
... Let's see.

2390
01:43:31,720 --> 01:43:32,960
Wait, I can... Stop!

2391
01:43:33,160 --> 01:43:34,200
Sitting on chairs!

2392
01:43:35,640 --> 01:43:37,340
... Mary, think of this...

2393
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:38,340
Superchat, thank you, thank you.

2394
01:43:38,340 --> 01:43:40,900
The one slur wasn't really bad after all.

2395
01:43:41,100 --> 01:43:41,900
Exactly, Mary!

2396
01:43:42,060 --> 01:43:43,180
Thank you for the superchat!

2397
01:43:43,280 --> 01:43:44,140
Thank you, thank you!

2398
01:43:44,380 --> 01:43:45,400
I knew it!

2399
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:47,080
I knew, like...

2400
01:43:47,080 --> 01:43:50,760
I knew there was a reason why I liked the one slur.

2401
01:43:51,200 --> 01:43:51,580
...

2402
01:43:54,180 --> 01:43:55,340
Wait, where's Cogsworth?

2403
01:43:55,480 --> 01:43:56,640
Where the fuck did he go?

2404
01:43:57,600 --> 01:43:58,360
Did he go here?

2405
01:43:58,700 --> 01:43:59,260
Oh, I see him.

2406
01:43:59,340 --> 01:44:00,060
He's over there.

2407
01:44:00,980 --> 01:44:02,040
Alright, let's see.

2408
01:44:02,300 --> 01:44:03,220
Wait, there's a pump?

2409
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:04,240
Oh yeah, because it was Halloween!

2410
01:44:05,380 --> 01:44:05,900
Hello?

2411
01:44:06,260 --> 01:44:06,540
...

2412
01:44:09,860 --> 01:44:10,820
No, they're alive!

2413
01:44:11,240 --> 01:44:13,060
Both my husband and my child are alive!

2414
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:17,020
Sean's out there, yeah!

2415
01:44:17,420 --> 01:44:17,720
Sean's out there, Cogsworth.

2416
01:44:18,060 --> 01:44:19,000
He's out there!

2417
01:44:19,300 --> 01:44:20,340
I need to find him.

2418
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:21,540
What about Cogsworth?

2419
01:44:24,680 --> 01:44:24,860
...

2420
01:44:24,860 --> 01:44:25,000
...

2421
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:25,400
...

2422
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:31,480
What?

2423
01:44:31,480 --> 01:44:32,700
Why did you travel?

2424
01:44:32,860 --> 01:44:33,540
You're useless.

2425
01:44:34,060 --> 01:44:34,580
...

2426
01:44:34,580 --> 01:44:35,260
...

2427
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:39,280
He likes it!

2428
01:44:39,500 --> 01:44:40,240
Guys, don't worry.

2429
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:42,900
Why would he come back to get pummeled if he doesn't like it?

2430
01:44:43,160 --> 01:44:43,280
...

2431
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:43,920
...

2432
01:44:47,320 --> 01:44:47,720
...

2433
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:49,400
We're gonna find Sean!

2434
01:44:50,720 --> 01:44:51,580
We did it!

2435
01:44:51,880 --> 01:44:52,260
...

2436
01:44:54,180 --> 01:44:56,740
It's cause he likes him giving him what he wants, guys.

2437
01:44:57,260 --> 01:44:57,400
...

2438
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:00,660
How dare you!

2439
01:45:00,860 --> 01:45:02,220
Wait, okay, I need to use the bathroom.

2440
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:03,660
Let me put on the radio for you guys.

2441
01:45:03,760 --> 01:45:05,080
It's gonna get demonetized anyway.

2442
01:45:05,480 --> 01:45:05,880
Alright.

2443
01:45:06,780 --> 01:45:07,880
What's a good radio station?

2444
01:45:10,220 --> 01:45:11,000
There you go.

2445
01:45:11,100 --> 01:45:11,840
We'll do this.

2446
01:45:11,980 --> 01:45:12,360
Oh, we're back.

2447
01:46:15,650 --> 01:46:16,390
I'm back!

2448
01:46:17,390 --> 01:46:18,570
I'm back, guys.

2449
01:46:19,310 --> 01:46:20,410
You guys like the radio?

2450
01:46:22,290 --> 01:46:23,390
Alright, let's see.

2451
01:46:23,510 --> 01:46:24,510
Let's loot a little bit.

2452
01:46:25,770 --> 01:46:27,470
Guys, we have to like...

2453
01:46:28,170 --> 01:46:29,930
We have to find our son Sean!

2454
01:46:30,510 --> 01:46:30,970
...

2455
01:46:31,750 --> 01:46:34,070
Who's definitely very much alive.

2456
01:46:34,930 --> 01:46:35,410
...

2457
01:46:36,550 --> 01:46:37,610
Alright, let's see.

2458
01:46:37,710 --> 01:46:38,330
Where do we go?

2459
01:46:38,650 --> 01:46:39,590
Where's my house?

2460
01:46:40,270 --> 01:46:41,130
It's like this way.

2461
01:46:41,210 --> 01:46:42,210
Okay, we have to go this way.

2462
01:46:46,290 --> 01:46:46,650
...

2463
01:46:46,650 --> 01:46:47,050
...

2464
01:46:48,870 --> 01:46:49,230
...

2465
01:46:49,230 --> 01:46:49,810
...

2466
01:46:51,230 --> 01:46:51,590
...

2467
01:46:51,590 --> 01:46:51,950
...

2468
01:46:51,950 --> 01:46:52,150
...

2469
01:46:52,150 --> 01:46:52,170
...

2470
01:46:52,170 --> 01:46:52,190
...

2471
01:46:53,250 --> 01:46:54,070
Are we in the right place?

2472
01:46:54,070 --> 01:46:54,630
Oh, the water's fine!

2473
01:46:55,150 --> 01:46:55,770
...

2474
01:46:58,730 --> 01:46:59,490
Guys...

2475
01:47:00,070 --> 01:47:01,030
It's not fine.

2476
01:47:01,510 --> 01:47:01,890
...

2477
01:47:01,890 --> 01:47:02,250
...

2478
01:47:06,250 --> 01:47:12,310
Guys, I've discovered that it was absolutely not fine.

2479
01:47:12,770 --> 01:47:13,530
...

2480
01:47:15,310 --> 01:47:17,050
Guys, who would've thought?

2481
01:47:17,310 --> 01:47:17,650
Oh, hey.

2482
01:47:17,930 --> 01:47:18,890
Dog meat.

2483
01:47:18,890 --> 01:47:20,370
Oh, shit!

2484
01:47:20,490 --> 01:47:22,010
Wait, I wanna wear his clothes!

2485
01:47:22,670 --> 01:47:24,270
Bro, his clothes look so...

2486
01:47:24,270 --> 01:47:27,290
His clothes accentuate my body!

2487
01:47:27,850 --> 01:47:28,630
Alright, let's see.

2488
01:47:28,690 --> 01:47:29,370
Where is apparel?

2489
01:47:29,750 --> 01:47:30,170
...

2490
01:47:31,870 --> 01:47:33,550
Okay, let's see.

2491
01:47:33,950 --> 01:47:36,990
Postman hat, drifter outfit, military...

2492
01:47:36,990 --> 01:47:38,350
What's military fatigue?

2493
01:47:38,890 --> 01:47:39,930
What's that look like?

2494
01:47:40,210 --> 01:47:40,530
...

2495
01:47:41,890 --> 01:47:42,810
Oh, shit.

2496
01:47:42,850 --> 01:47:43,870
I'm the postman.

2497
01:47:44,630 --> 01:47:46,090
You're gonna fuck your wife.

2498
01:47:46,710 --> 01:47:47,310
...

2499
01:47:48,890 --> 01:47:49,930
Alright, I have a deliver...

2500
01:47:49,930 --> 01:47:51,290
No, mock pigtails!

2501
01:47:51,390 --> 01:47:52,570
Oh, no, we shouldn't have a hat.

2502
01:47:53,390 --> 01:47:54,210
Alright, here we go.

2503
01:47:54,690 --> 01:47:56,350
And then... Oh, yellow fedora.

2504
01:47:56,370 --> 01:47:57,330
Where did I find this?

2505
01:47:58,030 --> 01:47:58,950
Alright, no hat.

2506
01:47:59,170 --> 01:48:00,350
I need you guys to see my hair.

2507
01:48:00,970 --> 01:48:01,570
There we go.

2508
01:48:02,730 --> 01:48:03,330
There we go.

2509
01:48:03,370 --> 01:48:05,650
Look, it shows off my build better.

2510
01:48:05,850 --> 01:48:06,490
I like that.

2511
01:48:07,030 --> 01:48:08,090
Alright, we go this way.

2512
01:48:08,310 --> 01:48:09,970
This is where dog meat shows up.

2513
01:48:10,010 --> 01:48:10,890
We need him for the gun.

2514
01:48:11,890 --> 01:48:12,890
That's the milkman.

2515
01:48:13,030 --> 01:48:14,170
Both works out too.

2516
01:48:14,350 --> 01:48:16,030
Don't you never heard about the postman too?

2517
01:48:16,190 --> 01:48:17,390
You gotta be careful with the two.

2518
01:48:18,890 --> 01:48:19,930
Be careful with the UPS guy.

2519
01:48:20,650 --> 01:48:21,530
Dog meat!

2520
01:48:22,510 --> 01:48:23,750
Hello, dog meat!

2521
01:48:27,550 --> 01:48:28,350
You okay?

2522
01:48:28,530 --> 01:48:29,230
You're a boss.

2523
01:48:29,650 --> 01:48:30,630
Where's your owner?

2524
01:48:31,410 --> 01:48:32,930
I'm your owner now.

2525
01:48:34,790 --> 01:48:35,310
...

2526
01:48:35,310 --> 01:48:35,710
Okay, then.

2527
01:48:36,430 --> 01:48:37,430
Let's stick together.

2528
01:48:38,370 --> 01:48:38,890
...

2529
01:48:41,630 --> 01:48:43,250
Wait, I wanna... Get over here!

2530
01:48:43,310 --> 01:48:43,930
I wanna pet you!

2531
01:48:44,690 --> 01:48:45,410
Wait there.

2532
01:48:45,870 --> 01:48:47,810
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

2533
01:48:48,250 --> 01:48:49,290
Wait, I can trade?

2534
01:48:49,590 --> 01:48:50,170
Dog meat.

2535
01:48:50,250 --> 01:48:50,430
What the fuck?

2536
01:48:50,450 --> 01:48:50,990
What do you want?

2537
01:48:52,090 --> 01:48:53,690
Dog meat, do you want a gun?

2538
01:48:54,450 --> 01:48:54,530
...

2539
01:48:54,530 --> 01:48:55,130
...

2540
01:48:58,850 --> 01:49:00,690
Dog meat, take this gun!

2541
01:49:03,050 --> 01:49:03,650
...

2542
01:49:04,530 --> 01:49:05,130
...

2543
01:49:06,190 --> 01:49:07,210
Give him toys?

2544
01:49:07,370 --> 01:49:08,090
Like what?

2545
01:49:08,290 --> 01:49:09,450
The baby rattle?

2546
01:49:09,750 --> 01:49:11,230
I have a baby rattle.

2547
01:49:11,310 --> 01:49:12,150
Does he like that?

2548
01:49:12,570 --> 01:49:13,170
...

2549
01:49:15,010 --> 01:49:16,510
He's got a gun.

2550
01:49:16,830 --> 01:49:17,730
Oh my god!

2551
01:49:17,730 --> 01:49:18,670
He has a gun!

2552
01:49:19,050 --> 01:49:20,990
What is he gonna do with it?

2553
01:49:21,190 --> 01:49:22,310
Do I have a toy?

2554
01:49:22,950 --> 01:49:24,050
Here, have a toy car.

2555
01:49:25,330 --> 01:49:26,510
Uh, there you go.

2556
01:49:28,210 --> 01:49:28,650
Uh...

2557
01:49:28,650 --> 01:49:30,030
Let's see it.

2558
01:49:30,110 --> 01:49:30,510
Talk.

2559
01:49:30,590 --> 01:49:31,110
How you doing?

2560
01:49:31,290 --> 01:49:34,070
You wanna play tricks?

2561
01:49:34,250 --> 01:49:34,790
You know tricks?

2562
01:49:35,110 --> 01:49:35,890
How smart are you?

2563
01:49:37,190 --> 01:49:37,390
...

2564
01:49:37,390 --> 01:49:41,930
Oh my god, he's so cute!

2565
01:49:42,850 --> 01:49:43,810
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

2566
01:49:43,810 --> 01:49:43,890
What else?

2567
01:49:43,890 --> 01:49:44,350
How you doing, buddy?

2568
01:49:44,670 --> 01:49:45,570
How you doing?

2569
01:49:45,870 --> 01:49:46,550
You wanna play fetch?

2570
01:49:46,990 --> 01:49:48,570
Think you can find something for me?

2571
01:49:50,090 --> 01:49:51,790
Uh, find me...

2572
01:49:51,790 --> 01:49:52,810
container?

2573
01:49:54,490 --> 01:49:55,430
What's a container?

2574
01:49:56,130 --> 01:49:57,350
You're so talented!

2575
01:49:58,090 --> 01:49:59,650
Oh my god, dog meat!

2576
01:49:59,750 --> 01:50:00,810
You're so talented!

2577
01:50:01,330 --> 01:50:02,730
Why are you barking me like that?

2578
01:50:02,750 --> 01:50:03,410
You have a gun!

2579
01:50:04,230 --> 01:50:04,770
...

2580
01:50:04,770 --> 01:50:07,490
I gave him a gun and a toy car.

2581
01:50:07,650 --> 01:50:08,710
He's fucking strapped.

2582
01:50:09,690 --> 01:50:11,230
Oh, there's a workshop here.

2583
01:50:12,390 --> 01:50:13,370
Okay, we got...

2584
01:50:13,890 --> 01:50:14,830
I don't know which...

2585
01:50:14,830 --> 01:50:18,930
I'm gonna go with first person and then when we're fighting...

2586
01:50:18,930 --> 01:50:22,170
What the fuck?!

2587
01:50:22,170 --> 01:50:22,770
What the fuck?!

2588
01:50:22,770 --> 01:50:23,450
Where did these...

2589
01:50:23,450 --> 01:50:24,530
Dog meat!

2590
01:50:25,170 --> 01:50:26,810
What the fuck happened?

2591
01:50:27,030 --> 01:50:30,430
I left for like one second, dog meat!

2592
01:50:31,010 --> 01:50:32,310
Holy shit!

2593
01:50:33,050 --> 01:50:35,510
I left for one second!

2594
01:50:36,810 --> 01:50:38,490
I left for one second!

2595
01:50:40,010 --> 01:50:41,670
Dog meat, shoot him!

2596
01:50:47,570 --> 01:50:48,310
Oh my god!

2597
01:50:48,330 --> 01:50:49,050
Oh shit!

2598
01:50:52,450 --> 01:50:53,630
Oh my god!

2599
01:50:53,690 --> 01:50:54,970
I left for one second, dog meat!

2600
01:50:55,010 --> 01:50:56,130
What the fuck happened?

2601
01:50:58,270 --> 01:50:59,230
What happened?

2602
01:51:00,170 --> 01:51:01,610
I went to loot!

2603
01:51:02,310 --> 01:51:03,430
Dog meat, no!

2604
01:51:04,250 --> 01:51:05,750
I'm gonna get a stim pack.

2605
01:51:05,910 --> 01:51:08,770
I know you can recover your HP.

2606
01:51:08,950 --> 01:51:10,050
You can't lie to me.

2607
01:51:12,130 --> 01:51:13,950
Stop faking it, dog meat!

2608
01:51:15,770 --> 01:51:17,190
See, you're okay.

2609
01:51:18,330 --> 01:51:19,710
I thought I was gonna...

2610
01:51:19,710 --> 01:51:22,510
You don't need a stim pack.

2611
01:51:23,710 --> 01:51:25,310
Don't fake it, man.

2612
01:51:26,790 --> 01:51:27,430
You're like...

2613
01:51:27,430 --> 01:51:28,190
Dog meat...

2614
01:51:28,190 --> 01:51:28,630
Get it.

2615
01:51:30,770 --> 01:51:32,810
I know he has self-heal.

2616
01:51:32,870 --> 01:51:33,850
He can't lie to me.

2617
01:51:34,510 --> 01:51:35,450
Heal your...

2618
01:51:35,450 --> 01:51:37,050
He's literally okay!

2619
01:51:37,210 --> 01:51:38,530
What do you mean?

2620
01:51:38,830 --> 01:51:40,830
He has self-heal!

2621
01:51:42,130 --> 01:51:43,370
I don't!

2622
01:51:43,370 --> 01:51:44,190
Wait, do I?

2623
01:51:44,190 --> 01:51:45,330
I don't know if I do.

2624
01:51:45,510 --> 01:51:46,690
Do I have self-heal?

2625
01:51:47,430 --> 01:51:48,430
I can't remember.

2626
01:51:49,070 --> 01:51:49,690
Dog... Stop!

2627
01:51:51,410 --> 01:51:52,130
Stop, doki!

2628
01:51:52,310 --> 01:51:52,890
Oh wait, no.

2629
01:51:52,970 --> 01:51:53,930
We need this.

2630
01:51:54,670 --> 01:51:55,670
Okay, safe storage.

2631
01:51:56,490 --> 01:51:56,970
Wait, no.

2632
01:51:57,030 --> 01:51:58,030
I wanna look at the safe storage.

2633
01:51:58,650 --> 01:52:00,250
Oh no, a dog with a gun.

2634
01:52:00,350 --> 01:52:02,310
Hopefully, we're not around anyone.

2635
01:52:02,430 --> 01:52:03,390
Sharka, thank you for the super chat.

2636
01:52:03,470 --> 01:52:03,750
Thank you.

2637
01:52:04,250 --> 01:52:05,830
Dog meat is dangerous out there.

2638
01:52:05,890 --> 01:52:06,390
Take this.

2639
01:52:06,590 --> 01:52:07,770
Alan, thank you for the super chat.

2640
01:52:07,850 --> 01:52:08,110
Thank you.

2641
01:52:08,850 --> 01:52:10,870
Take care of these barrels before you leave tonight.

2642
01:52:10,870 --> 01:52:12,770
Inspectors are coming first thing in the morning.

2643
01:52:12,930 --> 01:52:13,850
Just hide them with the others.

2644
01:52:14,050 --> 01:52:15,710
We'll figure out long-term solutions.

2645
01:52:17,870 --> 01:52:18,350
Okay.

2646
01:52:21,150 --> 01:52:22,550
What's the last service log?

2647
01:52:23,110 --> 01:52:24,910
Replace the atomic alternator in a 2073.

2648
01:52:26,050 --> 01:52:26,950
Co-verga.

2649
01:52:27,330 --> 01:52:28,030
Oh hey!

2650
01:52:28,390 --> 01:52:29,350
Is that the car?

2651
01:52:31,930 --> 01:52:32,870
Is that the car?

2652
01:52:35,590 --> 01:52:36,070
Okay.

2653
01:52:37,050 --> 01:52:37,750
Let's see.

2654
01:52:38,650 --> 01:52:40,330
Should we keep the radio on, guys?

2655
01:52:42,030 --> 01:52:43,510
Is there food in here?

2656
01:52:43,610 --> 01:52:45,050
No, there's no food in here.

2657
01:52:45,330 --> 01:52:46,150
God damn it.

2658
01:52:48,470 --> 01:52:48,970
Uh...

2659
01:52:50,170 --> 01:52:50,990
Grab this.

2660
01:52:51,730 --> 01:52:54,210
I still don't know if I wanna keep the...

2661
01:52:54,210 --> 01:52:55,890
If I wanna keep...

2662
01:52:55,890 --> 01:52:58,230
If I wanna play in first person.

2663
01:52:58,410 --> 01:52:59,170
Wait, where's my dog?

2664
01:53:00,690 --> 01:53:02,050
Where did my dog go?

2665
01:53:03,270 --> 01:53:04,030
Dog meat?

2666
01:53:04,110 --> 01:53:05,150
Oh, there he is.

2667
01:53:05,330 --> 01:53:06,130
Okay, command.

2668
01:53:07,430 --> 01:53:08,750
Oh, are you scared?

2669
01:53:09,050 --> 01:53:09,750
Follow me.

2670
01:53:12,870 --> 01:53:13,710
Follow me.

2671
01:53:14,050 --> 01:53:14,870
Follow me.

2672
01:53:14,870 --> 01:53:15,090
Get over here.

2673
01:53:17,390 --> 01:53:18,850
Where is the car though?

2674
01:53:19,050 --> 01:53:19,710
Is it this one?

2675
01:53:20,750 --> 01:53:21,290
Move here.

2676
01:53:23,450 --> 01:53:23,970
Here.

2677
01:53:24,170 --> 01:53:25,690
No, stop, stop, stop.

2678
01:53:25,830 --> 01:53:26,550
Stop moving.

2679
01:53:28,650 --> 01:53:30,350
I just want you to follow.

2680
01:53:34,610 --> 01:53:36,590
I'm so sorry.

2681
01:53:36,910 --> 01:53:38,950
I was trying to talk to you.

2682
01:53:39,270 --> 01:53:40,390
I was trying to talk to you.

2683
01:53:40,870 --> 01:53:41,790
I didn't mean to.

2684
01:53:41,930 --> 01:53:44,510
I swear to God.

2685
01:53:47,450 --> 01:53:49,610
I swear to God.

2686
01:53:50,130 --> 01:53:51,610
I swear to God.

2687
01:53:51,730 --> 01:53:52,110
I swear to God.

2688
01:53:52,110 --> 01:53:52,830
Oh my God.

2689
01:53:54,090 --> 01:53:55,830
It was an accident.

2690
01:53:56,070 --> 01:53:57,170
It was an accident.

2691
01:53:57,270 --> 01:53:58,250
I swear.

2692
01:54:00,550 --> 01:54:02,570
I swear to God.

2693
01:54:02,590 --> 01:54:03,690
It was an accident.

2694
01:54:03,950 --> 01:54:06,170
Oh my God.

2695
01:54:07,590 --> 01:54:08,690
Where is he?

2696
01:54:08,970 --> 01:54:09,950
Follow me.

2697
01:54:09,950 --> 01:54:12,150
How do I make him follow me forever?

2698
01:54:12,730 --> 01:54:14,510
Do I just take him to the settlement?

2699
01:54:17,130 --> 01:54:19,050
I was trying to...

2700
01:54:19,050 --> 01:54:21,170
I was just trying to press the button.

2701
01:54:21,250 --> 01:54:21,770
I swear.

2702
01:54:24,650 --> 01:54:25,450
Hold R.

2703
01:54:26,790 --> 01:54:27,770
Why are you whimpering?

2704
01:54:31,190 --> 01:54:32,790
Why do I cancel this?

2705
01:54:33,410 --> 01:54:34,270
Oh my God.

2706
01:54:34,730 --> 01:54:35,870
Oh my God.

2707
01:54:35,950 --> 01:54:36,290
He's alive.

2708
01:54:38,610 --> 01:54:40,270
No, he wants to...

2709
01:54:40,270 --> 01:54:41,390
He wants to follow me.

2710
01:54:41,390 --> 01:54:41,730
Follow.

2711
01:54:42,270 --> 01:54:43,070
See?

2712
01:54:43,710 --> 01:54:45,210
Come on, Doug.

2713
01:54:45,290 --> 01:54:46,490
Yeah, see?

2714
01:54:46,910 --> 01:54:48,010
Tough love.

2715
01:54:48,830 --> 01:54:51,070
It's all about the tough love.

2716
01:54:51,890 --> 01:54:55,010
I swear it was an accident.

2717
01:54:55,690 --> 01:54:57,130
I was trying...

2718
01:54:57,130 --> 01:54:58,310
Why was it...

2719
01:54:58,310 --> 01:55:01,630
Why was it on the head?

2720
01:55:06,950 --> 01:55:10,050
I would have whimpered too if I was shot.

2721
01:55:10,450 --> 01:55:11,650
Why was it on the head?

2722
01:55:11,850 --> 01:55:12,070
Why was it on the head?

2723
01:55:12,070 --> 01:55:13,210
Why was it on the head?

2724
01:55:14,970 --> 01:55:15,530
Okay.

2725
01:55:16,550 --> 01:55:17,390
Let's see.

2726
01:55:17,670 --> 01:55:20,530
We gotta go this way, I believe.

2727
01:55:21,430 --> 01:55:22,430
We'll go this way.

2728
01:55:25,490 --> 01:55:27,310
It was an accident, guys.

2729
01:55:27,770 --> 01:55:28,070
It was an accident, guys.

2730
01:55:28,750 --> 01:55:31,510
It's not my fault my hands naturally...

2731
01:55:31,630 --> 01:55:34,310
He like went to his head.

2732
01:55:35,170 --> 01:55:36,190
I sw...

2733
01:55:36,190 --> 01:55:37,390
Oh shit!

2734
01:55:38,590 --> 01:55:40,210
Get that shit away from me!

2735
01:55:41,610 --> 01:55:43,050
Okay, where's the other bug?

2736
01:55:43,730 --> 01:55:45,210
Where did the other one go?

2737
01:55:45,350 --> 01:55:45,910
I'll be okay.

2738
01:55:46,290 --> 01:55:50,810
See, this is exactly why I don't give a Stimpak to the dog.

2739
01:55:51,030 --> 01:55:53,130
I like naturally don't have selfia.

2740
01:55:53,350 --> 01:55:56,990
I have to eat fucking rat roach meat to stay alive.

2741
01:55:57,790 --> 01:55:58,810
Open the door.

2742
01:55:58,810 --> 01:56:00,490
Must be loot here, right?

2743
01:56:00,950 --> 01:56:02,510
No, do not sit on the couch.

2744
01:56:03,810 --> 01:56:05,010
Oh hey, Nuka Cola!

2745
01:56:06,250 --> 01:56:07,130
Nuka Cola!

2746
01:56:07,390 --> 01:56:08,190
Nuka Cola!

2747
01:56:09,830 --> 01:56:14,250
I hope you guys are okay that I swapped between first and third person.

2748
01:56:15,450 --> 01:56:19,290
I like to loot in first person, but I wanna shoot in third person.

2749
01:56:20,710 --> 01:56:21,610
Okay, let's see.

2750
01:56:21,710 --> 01:56:22,830
Grab all this junk.

2751
01:56:23,950 --> 01:56:24,950
Grab psycho.

2752
01:56:25,370 --> 01:56:26,710
What the fuck is psycho?

2753
01:56:26,710 --> 01:56:29,370
I'm playing on hard.

2754
01:56:29,530 --> 01:56:30,250
Wait, is he...

2755
01:56:30,250 --> 01:56:30,850
Okay.

2756
01:56:31,690 --> 01:56:32,430
Dog meat?

2757
01:56:33,270 --> 01:56:35,250
Oh, baseball bat behind the door?

2758
01:56:35,430 --> 01:56:36,810
What am I gonna do with a baseball bat?

2759
01:56:38,110 --> 01:56:39,950
There's no baseball bat, you liar.

2760
01:56:41,630 --> 01:56:42,530
What do you mean?

2761
01:56:42,650 --> 01:56:44,010
There's no baseball bat.

2762
01:56:45,510 --> 01:56:46,610
Sorry, dog meat.

2763
01:56:46,830 --> 01:56:47,810
Oh, there it is!

2764
01:56:50,150 --> 01:56:53,670
There must be like a way to quick shuffle in between like...

2765
01:56:54,550 --> 01:56:55,590
Between weapons.

2766
01:56:55,950 --> 01:56:56,690
Oh, there it is!

2767
01:56:56,690 --> 01:56:56,970
Fuck!

2768
01:56:58,250 --> 01:57:02,650
This is why... This is exactly why I don't play... I don't play this on...

2769
01:57:02,650 --> 01:57:04,430
I don't shoot in first person.

2770
01:57:04,550 --> 01:57:05,630
There's no crosshair.

2771
01:57:07,630 --> 01:57:09,230
I'm in Concord now.

2772
01:57:11,630 --> 01:57:12,530
Let's see.

2773
01:57:14,230 --> 01:57:18,610
How do I... What's that... Where's the hotkeys to swap like weapons?

2774
01:57:18,690 --> 01:57:19,170
Hold F?

2775
01:57:20,130 --> 01:57:20,930
It's not F.

2776
01:57:21,610 --> 01:57:22,510
Oh, there is F!

2777
01:57:23,630 --> 01:57:24,270
Uhh...

2778
01:57:25,390 --> 01:57:26,030
Nine.

2779
01:57:26,150 --> 01:57:26,670
Okay.

2780
01:57:26,690 --> 01:57:26,990
Okay, wait.

2781
01:57:27,110 --> 01:57:30,650
How do I... Okay, I wanna swap my weapons to baseball bat.

2782
01:57:32,170 --> 01:57:32,650
Uhh...

2783
01:57:34,430 --> 01:57:34,910
Q?

2784
01:57:35,230 --> 01:57:35,990
Oh, there it is!

2785
01:57:36,150 --> 01:57:36,410
Okay.

2786
01:57:37,290 --> 01:57:39,250
Okay, and then F...

2787
01:57:41,550 --> 01:57:42,030
F9.

2788
01:57:42,670 --> 01:57:43,410
There you go.

2789
01:57:43,710 --> 01:57:46,610
I can beat up some fucking bugs with my bat.

2790
01:57:51,130 --> 01:57:51,810
Can I?

2791
01:57:52,070 --> 01:57:54,450
I can play in third person to beat people up.

2792
01:57:57,130 --> 01:57:57,610
Hello?

2793
01:57:58,810 --> 01:58:00,170
I hear gunshots.

2794
01:58:02,770 --> 01:58:04,210
Any... Any enemy?

2795
01:58:04,810 --> 01:58:05,290
Enemy?

2796
01:58:07,750 --> 01:58:08,810
I have to go here.

2797
01:58:09,390 --> 01:58:11,510
Oh shit, we're gonna help like the settlement.

2798
01:58:11,790 --> 01:58:12,410
The... What is it?

2799
01:58:12,470 --> 01:58:13,690
The Minuteman or some shit?

2800
01:58:14,390 --> 01:58:14,870
Soon?

2801
01:58:15,050 --> 01:58:15,850
I hear them.

2802
01:58:15,910 --> 01:58:16,350
Oh loot.

2803
01:58:16,510 --> 01:58:17,410
But loot though...

2804
01:58:17,410 --> 01:58:18,470
Purified water!

2805
01:58:18,650 --> 01:58:20,610
I can sell that for so much money!

2806
01:58:21,690 --> 01:58:23,310
Guys, I can't drink yet.

2807
01:58:23,470 --> 01:58:24,130
I can pick this.

2808
01:58:24,130 --> 01:58:25,130
I can't pick that?

2809
01:58:25,390 --> 01:58:27,070
No, I'm too dumb.

2810
01:58:28,870 --> 01:58:30,190
Too dumb.

2811
01:58:30,890 --> 01:58:31,550
Sucks.

2812
01:58:32,890 --> 01:58:35,690
I can't be dumb and fucking jacked.

2813
01:58:35,870 --> 01:58:36,810
Okay, nice.

2814
01:58:37,880 --> 01:58:39,150
Is there anything in the Nuka Cola?

2815
01:58:39,290 --> 01:58:39,750
Oh, there is!

2816
01:58:41,880 --> 01:58:43,250
Is it precedent time?

2817
01:58:46,860 --> 01:58:47,520
Hello?

2818
01:58:47,900 --> 01:58:48,800
Anyone here?

2819
01:58:50,820 --> 01:58:52,320
Oh shit, there they are!

2820
01:58:53,620 --> 01:58:55,320
Oh, there he was.

2821
01:58:56,090 --> 01:58:56,880
Let me loot him.

2822
01:58:58,020 --> 01:59:00,540
Oh my god, there's a raider's outfit!

2823
01:59:00,900 --> 01:59:01,960
Are you okay, Dogmeat?

2824
01:59:02,160 --> 01:59:03,000
Did you kill him?

2825
01:59:03,380 --> 01:59:03,960
Nice.

2826
01:59:04,340 --> 01:59:06,320
Oh my god, I'm gonna look so pretty.

2827
01:59:06,620 --> 01:59:08,780
Give me a sec, I'm gonna change my outfit now.

2828
01:59:09,200 --> 01:59:11,940
Let's see, harness... damage resistance.

2829
01:59:12,180 --> 01:59:14,220
Oh wait, there's like stats.

2830
01:59:15,940 --> 01:59:18,460
I didn't realize there's stats.

2831
01:59:19,780 --> 01:59:21,240
Oh, right leg.

2832
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:24,300
Sack hood with straps?

2833
01:59:24,600 --> 01:59:26,040
What the fuck does that look like?

2834
01:59:26,860 --> 01:59:27,840
Oh god.

2835
01:59:28,080 --> 01:59:28,940
Okay, no.

2836
01:59:29,120 --> 01:59:30,260
We're not covering our head.

2837
01:59:30,500 --> 01:59:31,980
We don't need to cover our head.

2838
01:59:32,880 --> 01:59:33,680
Bop bop.

2839
01:59:37,560 --> 01:59:38,060
Alright.

2840
01:59:38,460 --> 01:59:39,320
Time to loot.

2841
01:59:39,440 --> 01:59:42,160
I should save them, but like, loot is more important.

2842
01:59:43,020 --> 01:59:44,020
Anything goes.

2843
01:59:46,300 --> 01:59:47,420
Is there fall damage?

2844
01:59:48,540 --> 01:59:49,040
Whoa.

2845
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:50,500
Nope.

2846
01:59:50,920 --> 01:59:51,420
Yeah!

2847
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:53,520
Alright, let me in.

2848
01:59:53,640 --> 01:59:56,440
Oh, there's the Minuteman outfit.

2849
01:59:58,440 --> 01:59:59,080
Wait, who?

2850
01:59:59,320 --> 02:00:00,120
Oh, there he is.

2851
02:00:00,260 --> 02:00:00,980
Hey there.

2852
02:00:02,180 --> 02:00:03,020
That's fucking right.

2853
02:00:03,520 --> 02:00:04,000
Whoa!

2854
02:00:11,340 --> 02:00:11,820
Whoops.

2855
02:00:13,260 --> 02:00:15,220
Can I like, beat his head off?

2856
02:00:17,360 --> 02:00:18,380
Oh, what's the point?

2857
02:00:19,020 --> 02:00:20,460
Oh my god, dude!

2858
02:00:21,580 --> 02:00:23,020
Dogmeat, what the fuck?

2859
02:00:23,700 --> 02:00:24,180
Stop!

2860
02:00:24,180 --> 02:00:25,060
Stop!

2861
02:00:25,910 --> 02:00:28,340
Guys, it's not what it looks like!

2862
02:00:28,440 --> 02:00:29,860
I swear to god!

2863
02:00:30,460 --> 02:00:32,720
Guys, it was an accident!

2864
02:00:33,100 --> 02:00:33,440
I swear!

2865
02:00:35,800 --> 02:00:38,900
Guys, I swear to god it was an accident!

2866
02:00:39,140 --> 02:00:40,740
I swear to god!

2867
02:00:41,160 --> 02:00:48,200
I know, like, it happened twice, but I swear I did not mean to do it.

2868
02:00:49,280 --> 02:00:50,180
I know.

2869
02:00:50,400 --> 02:00:52,820
Fool me once, shame on you!

2870
02:00:52,820 --> 02:00:55,860
But I swear to god!

2871
02:01:00,800 --> 02:01:03,700
It's not what it looks like!

2872
02:01:04,280 --> 02:01:04,600
And it's not what it looks like!

2873
02:01:04,820 --> 02:01:05,460
It's not what it looks like!

2874
02:01:05,460 --> 02:01:05,540
It's not what it looks like!

2875
02:01:09,380 --> 02:01:11,140
I love dogs!

2876
02:01:11,820 --> 02:01:14,720
My best friend's a dog, guys!

2877
02:01:19,750 --> 02:01:20,570
Okay.

2878
02:01:20,570 --> 02:01:20,790
Okay.

2879
02:01:22,730 --> 02:01:25,130
Wait, how do I... do I... it's not reloaded?

2880
02:01:25,150 --> 02:01:26,170
Oh, it doesn't have...

2881
02:01:26,650 --> 02:01:27,930
It doesn't have ammo.

2882
02:01:28,130 --> 02:01:28,770
There we go.

2883
02:01:29,090 --> 02:01:31,710
I was like, why isn't it not hitting?

2884
02:01:33,110 --> 02:01:33,810
Let's see.

2885
02:01:34,250 --> 02:01:37,010
Gotta loot while everything is going on.

2886
02:01:37,610 --> 02:01:39,690
There's so much stuff going on that I can loot.

2887
02:01:41,250 --> 02:01:42,770
Wait, what the fuck?

2888
02:01:45,230 --> 02:01:48,030
Oh, I have to reload ev... oh my god, I do!

2889
02:01:48,030 --> 02:01:48,650
I do!

2890
02:01:49,970 --> 02:01:52,130
I do have to reload every shot.

2891
02:01:52,210 --> 02:01:52,850
That fucking sucks.

2892
02:01:54,630 --> 02:01:56,410
Oh, there's an enemy in front of me.

2893
02:01:56,850 --> 02:01:57,930
I can see him.

2894
02:01:58,330 --> 02:01:59,830
I can see him on the map.

2895
02:02:02,150 --> 02:02:02,810
There we go.

2896
02:02:03,630 --> 02:02:04,510
Easy headshot.

2897
02:02:04,870 --> 02:02:05,710
Where's the other guy?

2898
02:02:07,550 --> 02:02:08,330
Where is he?

2899
02:02:10,710 --> 02:02:12,770
He's like, in my view, but where?

2900
02:02:14,190 --> 02:02:15,730
Let me grab his stuff though.

2901
02:02:16,330 --> 02:02:16,770
Nice.

2902
02:02:18,030 --> 02:02:18,170
What?

2903
02:02:18,170 --> 02:02:18,770
What are you gonna do?

2904
02:02:18,870 --> 02:02:19,390
Shoot me?

2905
02:02:20,450 --> 02:02:21,610
Can I open this?

2906
02:02:21,770 --> 02:02:23,050
God damn it, I'm too stupid.

2907
02:02:24,030 --> 02:02:25,910
Don't you hate it when you're just too stupid?

2908
02:02:27,150 --> 02:02:28,930
He does up the clippers...

2909
02:02:28,930 --> 02:02:29,450
Make a...

2910
02:02:29,950 --> 02:02:30,210
No!

2911
02:02:30,470 --> 02:02:31,690
Don't make a compilation!

2912
02:02:33,050 --> 02:02:34,770
Guys, I swear!

2913
02:02:36,630 --> 02:02:38,230
It was an accident!

2914
02:02:40,290 --> 02:02:42,510
Trevor, thank you for the super chat.

2915
02:02:42,610 --> 02:02:42,910
Thank you.

2916
02:02:43,050 --> 02:02:45,350
Select a potential password with mouse 1.

2917
02:02:45,450 --> 02:02:47,650
If your chosen password is incorrect, that match...

2918
02:02:48,030 --> 02:02:49,310
will be displayed on screen.

2919
02:02:49,450 --> 02:02:51,770
What the fuck am I looking at?

2920
02:02:52,570 --> 02:02:53,290
Error?

2921
02:02:53,810 --> 02:02:55,430
I can't tell if I...

2922
02:02:55,430 --> 02:02:55,990
Oh!

2923
02:02:58,610 --> 02:02:59,330
What?

2924
02:03:00,290 --> 02:03:01,010
Okay.

2925
02:03:04,390 --> 02:03:05,110
Okay.

2926
02:03:12,650 --> 02:03:13,750
Entry denied.

2927
02:03:14,010 --> 02:03:15,310
So not could.

2928
02:03:19,590 --> 02:03:20,110
Uhhhhhhhhhhhhh.

2929
02:03:21,490 --> 02:03:22,010
This?

2930
02:03:23,270 --> 02:03:23,790
Error?

2931
02:03:25,730 --> 02:03:27,050
I'm so confused.

2932
02:03:28,990 --> 02:03:30,450
How many words were right?

2933
02:03:30,550 --> 02:03:32,750
Did it tell me how many words were right?

2934
02:03:35,170 --> 02:03:36,650
Wait, which one did I play?

2935
02:03:36,730 --> 02:03:37,870
Okay, I clicked could.

2936
02:03:38,370 --> 02:03:40,030
And it says one word.

2937
02:03:40,130 --> 02:03:41,090
How about owner?

2938
02:03:41,850 --> 02:03:42,370
Zero.

2939
02:03:42,930 --> 02:03:44,870
Okay, so it's not...

2940
02:03:46,650 --> 02:03:47,170
Umm...

2941
02:03:48,310 --> 02:03:50,510
Okay, so one letter was right in could.

2942
02:03:50,770 --> 02:03:52,990
So there's no O's in the word.

2943
02:03:53,170 --> 02:03:54,290
So there's no O's.

2944
02:03:54,730 --> 02:03:55,810
That's that we know.

2945
02:03:56,330 --> 02:03:58,230
That's that we know there's no O's.

2946
02:03:58,590 --> 02:03:59,950
And then there's no...

2947
02:03:59,950 --> 02:04:00,890
There could be a D.

2948
02:04:01,570 --> 02:04:02,710
So it could be sand.

2949
02:04:06,190 --> 02:04:07,390
It could be sands.

2950
02:04:07,670 --> 02:04:09,150
Or it could be spied.

2951
02:04:10,670 --> 02:04:11,150
Cause...

2952
02:04:12,650 --> 02:04:13,610
Sands, spied...

2953
02:04:15,790 --> 02:04:16,270
Build...

2954
02:04:18,150 --> 02:04:18,630
Uhh...

2955
02:04:19,550 --> 02:04:20,610
There's no O.

2956
02:04:20,650 --> 02:04:22,550
Okay, sand, spied...

2957
02:04:23,990 --> 02:04:24,630
Build...

2958
02:04:24,630 --> 02:04:27,110
It's the letter in the same spy?

2959
02:04:27,590 --> 02:04:29,370
It's letter and position.

2960
02:04:29,590 --> 02:04:31,550
Oh, it's letter and position.

2961
02:04:32,530 --> 02:04:33,170
Ohhhhhhh!

2962
02:04:36,490 --> 02:04:37,130
Ohhhhhhh!

2963
02:04:37,990 --> 02:04:39,270
Okay, okay.

2964
02:04:39,530 --> 02:04:41,990
Alright, so...

2965
02:04:41,990 --> 02:04:44,690
Couldn't be spied because there's no E.

2966
02:04:44,990 --> 02:04:47,390
So it could still be sand then.

2967
02:04:47,550 --> 02:04:48,110
Right?

2968
02:04:48,870 --> 02:04:49,610
Let's say...

2969
02:04:49,610 --> 02:04:50,630
2, 4, 5.

2970
02:04:50,730 --> 02:04:51,930
No, cause it's like the fifth.

2971
02:04:52,050 --> 02:04:52,890
So it can't be sand.

2972
02:04:54,110 --> 02:04:54,930
2, 4, 5.

2973
02:04:54,990 --> 02:04:55,850
It could be spied!

2974
02:04:55,970 --> 02:04:56,270
Oh wait, no.

2975
02:04:56,450 --> 02:04:57,230
We just...

2976
02:04:57,230 --> 02:04:58,290
It could be build.

2977
02:04:58,430 --> 02:04:59,970
It could be build for the D.

2978
02:05:02,110 --> 02:05:02,910
Because like...

2979
02:05:02,910 --> 02:05:04,430
Could had one likeness.

2980
02:05:04,650 --> 02:05:07,010
And it could be like the D at the end.

2981
02:05:07,090 --> 02:05:07,430
Right?

2982
02:05:09,450 --> 02:05:09,850
Like...

2983
02:05:09,850 --> 02:05:10,730
Build or third.

2984
02:05:10,890 --> 02:05:11,730
Okay, we're gonna try build.

2985
02:05:12,810 --> 02:05:13,210
Likeness.

2986
02:05:13,330 --> 02:05:14,670
Okay, it's one more.

2987
02:05:14,790 --> 02:05:15,470
So it could be...

2988
02:05:15,470 --> 02:05:15,690
It's third.

2989
02:05:16,030 --> 02:05:17,710
Okay, so...

2990
02:05:17,710 --> 02:05:18,010
Build.

2991
02:05:18,090 --> 02:05:18,650
It's not...

2992
02:05:18,650 --> 02:05:19,810
Guys, I'm not locked out.

2993
02:05:19,950 --> 02:05:21,070
Guys, I'm not smart enough.

2994
02:05:22,710 --> 02:05:24,070
Oh, we're set for 10 seconds!

2995
02:05:24,190 --> 02:05:25,130
Guys, we can wait it out.

2996
02:05:28,730 --> 02:05:29,790
Guys, it's okay.

2997
02:05:29,850 --> 02:05:30,810
We can wait it out.

2998
02:05:32,170 --> 02:05:33,230
Alright, I got this.

2999
02:05:33,290 --> 02:05:34,230
Guys, I got this!

3000
02:05:34,650 --> 02:05:35,830
Oh, it's a new one!

3001
02:05:36,070 --> 02:05:37,230
Okay, we'll do...

3002
02:05:37,230 --> 02:05:39,150
I got leveled up!

3003
02:05:39,190 --> 02:05:39,950
For failing!

3004
02:05:40,330 --> 02:05:42,350
I love leveling up for failing!

3005
02:05:42,710 --> 02:05:43,150
Lying.

3006
02:05:43,730 --> 02:05:44,170
Zero.

3007
02:05:44,310 --> 02:05:46,390
Okay, there's no L, Y, I, and G.

3008
02:05:46,830 --> 02:05:47,270
Okay.

3009
02:05:47,270 --> 02:05:48,030
Melba spend.

3010
02:05:48,490 --> 02:05:49,190
There's one.

3011
02:05:49,450 --> 02:05:49,810
Okay.

3012
02:05:50,170 --> 02:05:51,310
So it's...

3013
02:05:52,070 --> 02:05:54,730
Okay, so there's one likeness.

3014
02:05:58,570 --> 02:06:00,050
There's one likeness.

3015
02:06:00,730 --> 02:06:01,250
So...

3016
02:06:02,870 --> 02:06:04,570
So it could be like...

3017
02:06:05,150 --> 02:06:06,430
It could be D again.

3018
02:06:07,650 --> 02:06:08,970
It can be D again.

3019
02:06:09,450 --> 02:06:10,410
It could be...

3020
02:06:10,950 --> 02:06:11,470
Bonds!

3021
02:06:13,090 --> 02:06:14,510
It's not N, that's for sure.

3022
02:06:14,630 --> 02:06:15,310
Okay, look.

3023
02:06:15,390 --> 02:06:15,870
There's spend.

3024
02:06:16,570 --> 02:06:17,250
Alright, so...

3025
02:06:17,250 --> 02:06:18,450
Two, four...

3026
02:06:18,830 --> 02:06:19,550
It could be...

3027
02:06:19,550 --> 02:06:20,890
The last has to be a D.

3028
02:06:21,710 --> 02:06:22,150
Two...

3029
02:06:22,150 --> 02:06:22,570
Okay, wait.

3030
02:06:22,790 --> 02:06:24,330
Two, four, five.

3031
02:06:24,510 --> 02:06:25,330
Okay, it's the fifth.

3032
02:06:25,810 --> 02:06:26,710
Is there any...

3033
02:06:27,550 --> 02:06:27,990
Spends?

3034
02:06:28,250 --> 02:06:29,030
It's not...

3035
02:06:29,030 --> 02:06:29,650
There's no more.

3036
02:06:29,730 --> 02:06:30,210
There's no more.

3037
02:06:30,330 --> 02:06:30,590
Okay.

3038
02:06:32,850 --> 02:06:33,290
So...

3039
02:06:33,290 --> 02:06:34,470
It's either...

3040
02:06:34,470 --> 02:06:36,490
It's either S, P, E, or N.

3041
02:06:38,850 --> 02:06:39,910
Oh, they're shady?

3042
02:06:40,110 --> 02:06:40,530
We're shady!

3043
02:06:42,090 --> 02:06:43,050
No, that's four!

3044
02:06:43,370 --> 02:06:44,770
Because like, it's the fifth!

3045
02:06:45,250 --> 02:06:46,670
Alright, let's try...

3046
02:06:46,670 --> 02:06:47,230
Let's try...

3047
02:06:47,230 --> 02:06:47,630
Let's try shady.

3048
02:06:48,290 --> 02:06:49,650
There's two like this!

3049
02:06:49,890 --> 02:06:50,410
Okay!

3050
02:06:50,670 --> 02:06:52,470
It could be S, A...

3051
02:06:52,470 --> 02:06:54,270
It can't be D.

3052
02:06:54,450 --> 02:06:55,470
It could be D though.

3053
02:06:55,870 --> 02:06:56,730
Oh, no.

3054
02:06:59,090 --> 02:07:00,710
Wait, can I just lockpick this?

3055
02:07:01,070 --> 02:07:02,470
Guys, I'm just gonna lockpick this.

3056
02:07:12,080 --> 02:07:13,480
Let me be...

3057
02:07:13,480 --> 02:07:14,000
No!

3058
02:07:23,600 --> 02:07:24,300
It's okay.

3059
02:07:24,300 --> 02:07:26,260
My bobby pin is...

3060
02:07:26,260 --> 02:07:26,620
No!

3061
02:07:26,920 --> 02:07:27,440
It's okay.

3062
02:07:32,090 --> 02:07:32,530
It's okay.

3063
02:07:32,530 --> 02:07:33,070
Oh, no.

3064
02:07:33,950 --> 02:07:34,810
We did it!

3065
02:07:34,830 --> 02:07:35,050
No.

3066
02:07:36,890 --> 02:07:37,810
We did it!

3067
02:07:38,170 --> 02:07:38,610
Yay!

3068
02:07:39,650 --> 02:07:40,730
Can I still do this?

3069
02:07:40,930 --> 02:07:41,670
Okay, let's...

3070
02:07:41,670 --> 02:07:42,950
We unlocked it anyway.

3071
02:07:43,070 --> 02:07:43,250
Okay.

3072
02:07:43,450 --> 02:07:43,890
Anyway.

3073
02:07:44,030 --> 02:07:44,710
So, alright.

3074
02:07:44,850 --> 02:07:46,010
So, we figured out...

3075
02:07:46,010 --> 02:07:46,590
Okay.

3076
02:07:46,650 --> 02:07:47,870
There's one like this.

3077
02:07:48,030 --> 02:07:48,190
And...

3078
02:07:53,050 --> 02:07:53,490
Alright.

3079
02:07:53,690 --> 02:07:55,190
So, there's one like...

3080
02:07:55,190 --> 02:07:55,450
Okay.

3081
02:07:55,490 --> 02:07:56,190
Now, it's just...

3082
02:07:56,190 --> 02:07:56,850
Out of pride.

3083
02:07:57,570 --> 02:07:59,010
Now, it's just...

3084
02:07:59,850 --> 02:08:01,090
Now, it's just out of pride.

3085
02:08:01,110 --> 02:08:01,790
Pride now.

3086
02:08:02,030 --> 02:08:02,730
Alright, range.

3087
02:08:02,810 --> 02:08:04,270
There's one likeness.

3088
02:08:04,510 --> 02:08:05,990
Okay, it could be faces.

3089
02:08:06,330 --> 02:08:07,810
There's zero, so it's not A.

3090
02:08:08,130 --> 02:08:12,550
We know it's not A because like, none of us match.

3091
02:08:12,850 --> 02:08:14,810
So it's either R, N, G, or E.

3092
02:08:15,750 --> 02:08:18,910
So, alright, there's no other... there's an R here.

3093
02:08:19,130 --> 02:08:19,930
We could try to rely.

3094
02:08:20,510 --> 02:08:21,590
I did it!

3095
02:08:21,950 --> 02:08:23,110
Oh my god!

3096
02:08:23,170 --> 02:08:24,250
We did it!

3097
02:08:24,290 --> 02:08:27,350
We unlocked... guys, I fucking knew it, guys.

3098
02:08:27,350 --> 02:08:29,810
God, I'm so fucking smart.

3099
02:08:30,130 --> 02:08:32,370
There's nothing in... oh, there's a power core.

3100
02:08:32,570 --> 02:08:33,430
There's a fusion core.

3101
02:08:33,570 --> 02:08:33,930
Let's go.

3102
02:08:35,350 --> 02:08:36,570
I did it, guys.

3103
02:08:37,150 --> 02:08:39,290
I fucking knew I wasn't that stupid.

3104
02:08:39,890 --> 02:08:40,870
I knew it.

3105
02:08:42,450 --> 02:08:43,770
There's hope for you all.

3106
02:08:44,130 --> 02:08:47,250
If I can solve that, you can all solve it.

3107
02:08:47,550 --> 02:08:48,510
Where do I go?

3108
02:08:48,630 --> 02:08:50,070
There's so many places to go.

3109
02:08:50,870 --> 02:08:52,110
Okay, oh, scalpel.

3110
02:08:52,350 --> 02:08:52,830
Nice.

3111
02:08:53,230 --> 02:08:54,250
I learned WURTLE.

3112
02:08:54,370 --> 02:08:55,790
I've never played WURTLE before.

3113
02:08:55,970 --> 02:08:57,330
This is like... this has to be like...

3114
02:08:57,350 --> 02:08:59,970
the very first time I've ever played WURTLE.

3115
02:09:00,130 --> 02:09:00,670
Chat.

3116
02:09:01,630 --> 02:09:05,070
This actually is the very first time.

3117
02:09:06,430 --> 02:09:06,930
What's that?

3118
02:09:08,290 --> 02:09:09,270
Somebody here.

3119
02:09:10,450 --> 02:09:11,410
Oh shit!

3120
02:09:12,350 --> 02:09:13,650
It's like, where's his head?

3121
02:09:14,210 --> 02:09:15,870
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

3122
02:09:16,010 --> 02:09:17,130
Give me a sec, I'm reloading!

3123
02:09:19,270 --> 02:09:21,150
Guys, it's so nice.

3124
02:09:21,490 --> 02:09:23,230
He actually like...

3125
02:09:23,230 --> 02:09:24,970
Guys, it's so good.

3126
02:09:25,030 --> 02:09:26,430
He actually like fucking...

3127
02:09:26,430 --> 02:09:28,190
waited until I...

3128
02:09:29,470 --> 02:09:31,470
He waited until I reload.

3129
02:09:31,850 --> 02:09:33,210
Isn't that great?

3130
02:09:34,030 --> 02:09:35,990
People are so like...

3131
02:09:36,610 --> 02:09:37,570
They're so polite.

3132
02:09:37,970 --> 02:09:40,270
People are so polite that they waited for me.

3133
02:09:40,430 --> 02:09:41,070
He was so polite.

3134
02:09:41,150 --> 02:09:41,650
Exactly.

3135
02:09:42,350 --> 02:09:43,990
Is there anybody here that I can shoot?

3136
02:09:45,830 --> 02:09:47,930
I hear people reloading.

3137
02:09:48,630 --> 02:09:50,390
But I have no idea where they are.

3138
02:09:51,650 --> 02:09:52,630
Alright, let's go up.

3139
02:09:53,210 --> 02:09:54,350
It's time to go up.

3140
02:09:54,490 --> 02:09:55,350
Dog meat.

3141
02:09:56,430 --> 02:09:56,970
Oh, there he is.

3142
02:09:57,290 --> 02:09:57,830
Peek me!

3143
02:09:58,690 --> 02:09:59,530
Peek me, bitch!

3144
02:10:00,170 --> 02:10:00,710
Peek me!

3145
02:10:02,210 --> 02:10:02,750
Peek me!

3146
02:10:04,790 --> 02:10:06,030
Oh my god.

3147
02:10:07,170 --> 02:10:07,970
Oh shit!

3148
02:10:08,070 --> 02:10:08,690
What did he...

3149
02:10:08,690 --> 02:10:09,910
Wait, there's more?

3150
02:10:10,510 --> 02:10:11,990
Dog meat, please bite him!

3151
02:10:12,010 --> 02:10:12,610
I'm so sorry!

3152
02:10:14,730 --> 02:10:15,990
Oh, I saved him!

3153
02:10:16,950 --> 02:10:18,130
Don't say I didn't do nothing.

3154
02:10:18,310 --> 02:10:19,130
I saved him.

3155
02:10:19,170 --> 02:10:21,130
He was about to get kicked, but I stopped him.

3156
02:10:22,130 --> 02:10:22,770
There we go.

3157
02:10:23,350 --> 02:10:24,410
Did I get like double?

3158
02:10:25,170 --> 02:10:25,730
Nice.

3159
02:10:26,810 --> 02:10:27,550
There we go.

3160
02:10:27,830 --> 02:10:29,270
Oh shit, I leveled up!

3161
02:10:30,130 --> 02:10:30,690
How do I...

3162
02:10:30,690 --> 02:10:31,490
Alright, nice.

3163
02:10:31,630 --> 02:10:32,090
Can I...

3164
02:10:33,190 --> 02:10:35,270
The first thing I do is like...

3165
02:10:35,270 --> 02:10:35,910
Can I...

3166
02:10:36,670 --> 02:10:38,550
Can I do more strength?

3167
02:10:43,730 --> 02:10:45,390
Channel your chi to unleash...

3168
02:10:45,390 --> 02:10:46,410
Crunching attacks.

3169
02:10:46,830 --> 02:10:48,770
Your quick hands make pocketing easier.

3170
02:10:50,110 --> 02:10:50,670
Toughness...

3171
02:10:52,190 --> 02:10:52,890
Let's see.

3172
02:10:53,150 --> 02:10:54,510
Let Vault-Tec guide you.

3173
02:10:54,550 --> 02:10:56,430
The path you're closest is displayed.

3174
02:10:56,430 --> 02:10:57,470
In VATS.

3175
02:10:57,530 --> 02:10:58,210
Oh, I like that!

3176
02:10:58,510 --> 02:10:59,150
Through chemistry.

3177
02:10:59,510 --> 02:10:59,950
Yeah.

3178
02:11:00,610 --> 02:11:01,050
Confirm.

3179
02:11:01,090 --> 02:11:01,470
Accept.

3180
02:11:02,250 --> 02:11:02,990
I want that.

3181
02:11:03,830 --> 02:11:04,810
What else can I do?

3182
02:11:05,050 --> 02:11:06,930
I'm called Racket69 and I...

3183
02:11:08,030 --> 02:11:09,290
Should I put more in?

3184
02:11:09,730 --> 02:11:10,810
Fortune finder?

3185
02:11:11,310 --> 02:11:11,750
Whoa!

3186
02:11:12,390 --> 02:11:13,990
Can I... I should do more gunslinger.

3187
02:11:13,990 --> 02:11:14,730
I should do gunslinger.

3188
02:11:14,810 --> 02:11:15,050
Yeah.

3189
02:11:15,510 --> 02:11:16,570
It's all about the guns.

3190
02:11:17,490 --> 02:11:18,250
Do I have more?

3191
02:11:20,030 --> 02:11:20,470
No.

3192
02:11:20,710 --> 02:11:22,270
Alright, we got gunslinger.

3193
02:11:23,210 --> 02:11:23,650
And...

3194
02:11:24,650 --> 02:11:25,310
Useless perk.

3195
02:11:25,310 --> 02:11:26,690
What do you mean useless?

3196
02:11:27,290 --> 02:11:28,470
What do you mean?

3197
02:11:30,110 --> 02:11:31,990
Bro, the worst perk?

3198
02:11:32,190 --> 02:11:33,170
What do you mean?

3199
02:11:34,410 --> 02:11:35,870
Which one was the...

3200
02:11:35,870 --> 02:11:36,270
What?

3201
02:11:36,290 --> 02:11:37,310
The VATS?

3202
02:11:39,430 --> 02:11:40,910
Guys, you don't understand.

3203
02:11:41,170 --> 02:11:42,070
I'm always lost.

3204
02:11:46,330 --> 02:11:48,350
I don't think it's useless.

3205
02:11:51,830 --> 02:11:54,490
I don't think it's useless, guys.

3206
02:11:54,490 --> 02:11:55,790
You just don't understand.

3207
02:11:58,350 --> 02:12:01,210
You don't appreciate the little things in the world.

3208
02:12:02,230 --> 02:12:03,030
Okay, nice.

3209
02:12:03,190 --> 02:12:04,130
We got to take his clothes.

3210
02:12:04,450 --> 02:12:05,210
Is he enemy?

3211
02:12:06,170 --> 02:12:06,930
Oh, shit.

3212
02:12:06,990 --> 02:12:07,270
Sorry.

3213
02:12:11,730 --> 02:12:15,470
That would be so unfortunate if I killed an essential NPC.

3214
02:12:20,030 --> 02:12:21,150
Alright, let's see.

3215
02:12:24,990 --> 02:12:25,510
Oh, hey.

3216
02:12:26,050 --> 02:12:26,830
Alright, this way.

3217
02:12:28,670 --> 02:12:30,270
If you don't use it...

3218
02:12:31,170 --> 02:12:32,150
I'm going to use it all.

3219
02:12:32,690 --> 02:12:34,090
Just wait and see, guys.

3220
02:12:34,550 --> 02:12:35,670
I'm going to use it all.

3221
02:12:37,010 --> 02:12:38,630
I'll let you in on a little dirty little secret.

3222
02:12:38,730 --> 02:12:41,470
You can get more stats above 10 if you use the boost.

3223
02:12:41,550 --> 02:12:42,690
Actually, just don't get addicted.

3224
02:12:42,850 --> 02:12:44,390
Johnny, thank you for the super chat.

3225
02:12:44,510 --> 02:12:44,750
Thank you.

3226
02:12:44,930 --> 02:12:45,270
Thank you.

3227
02:12:46,630 --> 02:12:47,310
Preston Garvey.

3228
02:12:47,650 --> 02:12:48,550
Commonwealth Minuteman.

3229
02:12:49,630 --> 02:12:50,170
Oh, wait.

3230
02:12:50,250 --> 02:12:50,410
What?

3231
02:12:50,450 --> 02:12:50,930
Talk to me.

3232
02:12:51,250 --> 02:12:51,610
Minuteman?

3233
02:12:52,390 --> 02:12:52,750
Minuteman?

3234
02:12:53,430 --> 02:12:55,870
So now I'm traveling backward in time.

3235
02:12:56,130 --> 02:12:57,690
Protect the people at a minute's notice.

3236
02:12:57,950 --> 02:12:59,050
That was the idea.

3237
02:12:59,590 --> 02:13:00,730
So I joined up.

3238
02:13:00,810 --> 02:13:01,810
Wanted to make a difference.

3239
02:13:02,170 --> 02:13:03,430
And I did, but...

3240
02:13:03,430 --> 02:13:05,050
things fell apart.

3241
02:13:05,930 --> 02:13:08,410
Now it looks like I'm the last Minuteman left standing.

3242
02:13:08,570 --> 02:13:09,390
Wait, you're the last one?

3243
02:13:11,310 --> 02:13:12,170
What happened?

3244
02:13:12,490 --> 02:13:14,190
What about the people around you?

3245
02:13:14,290 --> 02:13:15,430
Are they Minuteman too?

3246
02:13:16,550 --> 02:13:17,870
Who are these people?

3247
02:13:19,010 --> 02:13:20,830
Just folks looking for a new home.

3248
02:13:20,950 --> 02:13:21,910
A fresh start.

3249
02:13:22,990 --> 02:13:24,370
I've been with them since Quincy.

3250
02:13:25,430 --> 02:13:28,370
Lexington looked good for a while, but the ghouls drove us out of there.

3251
02:13:29,150 --> 02:13:29,990
The ghouls?

3252
02:13:31,490 --> 02:13:34,170
A month ago, there were 20 of us.

3253
02:13:34,610 --> 02:13:35,370
How many now?

3254
02:13:35,630 --> 02:13:36,270
Yesterday, there were eight.

3255
02:13:37,130 --> 02:13:38,090
Now we're five.

3256
02:13:39,190 --> 02:13:40,470
They just left you, right?

3257
02:13:40,770 --> 02:13:41,910
They didn't die, right?

3258
02:13:42,790 --> 02:13:43,590
Time to eat dinner.

3259
02:13:45,730 --> 02:13:47,050
And this here is Sturgis.

3260
02:13:47,270 --> 02:13:47,690
Hey.

3261
02:13:49,610 --> 02:13:50,030
Okay.

3262
02:13:51,090 --> 02:13:51,990
It's a cruel...

3263
02:13:51,990 --> 02:13:52,770
Sounds rough, buddy.

3264
02:13:53,030 --> 02:13:53,250
Sorry.

3265
02:13:53,930 --> 02:13:54,930
Sounds really rough.

3266
02:13:55,610 --> 02:13:56,090
Thanks.

3267
02:13:57,570 --> 02:13:59,390
It's good to meet someone who really cares.

3268
02:14:01,710 --> 02:14:04,510
Anyway, we figured Concord would be a safe place to settle.

3269
02:14:04,930 --> 02:14:06,490
Those raiders proved us wrong.

3270
02:14:06,890 --> 02:14:07,370
But...

3271
02:14:08,050 --> 02:14:09,730
Well, we do have one idea.

3272
02:14:10,150 --> 02:14:10,630
Nope.

3273
02:14:12,670 --> 02:14:13,390
Tell me.

3274
02:14:14,310 --> 02:14:15,570
I'm being assertive.

3275
02:14:15,610 --> 02:14:16,170
Tell me.

3276
02:14:17,370 --> 02:14:19,490
There's a crashed vertibird up on the roof.

3277
02:14:19,950 --> 02:14:20,690
Old school.

3278
02:14:20,690 --> 02:14:21,490
A what?

3279
02:14:21,830 --> 02:14:23,090
You might have seen it.

3280
02:14:23,450 --> 02:14:28,790
Well, looks like one of its passengers left behind a seriously sweet goodie.

3281
02:14:28,810 --> 02:14:30,110
We're talking about...

3282
02:14:30,110 --> 02:14:31,130
I'm munching pizza.

3283
02:14:31,370 --> 02:14:33,230
T-45 power armor.

3284
02:14:33,410 --> 02:14:34,810
Military issue.

3285
02:14:35,690 --> 02:14:37,090
Oh, power armor.

3286
02:14:37,970 --> 02:14:39,130
I like it.

3287
02:14:39,270 --> 02:14:40,270
I like it.

3288
02:14:41,890 --> 02:14:43,410
Yeah, I thought you might.

3289
02:14:43,890 --> 02:14:45,630
Protection with an added bonus.

3290
02:14:47,170 --> 02:14:48,330
Get the suit.

3291
02:14:48,330 --> 02:14:51,370
You can rip the minigun right off the vertibird.

3292
02:14:52,690 --> 02:14:55,150
No raiders getting express tickets to hell.

3293
02:14:55,470 --> 02:14:56,290
Sturgis, tell her!

3294
02:14:56,710 --> 02:14:58,050
Are you still telling her?

3295
02:15:02,330 --> 02:15:02,810
Minigun.

3296
02:15:02,850 --> 02:15:04,330
And I can use the minigun like a rifle.

3297
02:15:04,570 --> 02:15:05,590
Don't see why not.

3298
02:15:05,950 --> 02:15:07,370
It'll have a manual trigger.

3299
02:15:07,770 --> 02:15:11,810
Just aim it at the bad guys and do the old spray and pray.

3300
02:15:12,790 --> 02:15:15,590
Now, as for the armor, it's out of juice.

3301
02:15:15,770 --> 02:15:17,510
Probably has been for a hundred years.

3302
02:15:17,510 --> 02:15:19,370
It can be powered up again.

3303
02:15:20,090 --> 02:15:21,810
But we're a bit stuck.

3304
02:15:22,990 --> 02:15:23,470
Hmm?

3305
02:15:24,970 --> 02:15:25,790
I'll help you.

3306
02:15:25,910 --> 02:15:28,070
I have a fusion core.

3307
02:15:29,910 --> 02:15:31,390
A standardized fusion core.

3308
02:15:32,050 --> 02:15:37,350
Your high-grade long-term nuclear battery used by the military and some companies way back when.

3309
02:15:37,890 --> 02:15:39,410
And we know right where to find one.

3310
02:15:39,490 --> 02:15:41,210
But we can't get to the damn thing.

3311
02:15:41,650 --> 02:15:42,970
It's down in the basement.

3312
02:15:43,570 --> 02:15:44,470
Wait, I got it!

3313
02:15:44,690 --> 02:15:45,470
Security gate.

3314
02:15:45,850 --> 02:15:46,990
I have it right here.

3315
02:15:46,990 --> 02:15:47,870
I fix stuff.

3316
02:15:48,190 --> 02:15:49,090
I tinker.

3317
02:15:49,970 --> 02:15:52,210
Bypassing security ain't exactly my forte.

3318
02:15:52,370 --> 02:15:53,950
Wait, I'm smarter than Preston!

3319
02:15:54,830 --> 02:15:57,030
Guys, I'm smarter than him.

3320
02:15:57,330 --> 02:15:58,590
I already have it.

3321
02:15:58,710 --> 02:16:00,030
I already grabbed the fusion core.

3322
02:16:00,190 --> 02:16:00,690
We're set.

3323
02:16:01,050 --> 02:16:01,910
Well, all right.

3324
02:16:02,390 --> 02:16:03,210
Maybe I'll look...

3325
02:16:03,210 --> 02:16:04,250
You guys gotta say I'm not smarter.

3326
02:16:04,290 --> 02:16:05,250
I'm smarter than this fucker.

3327
02:16:05,290 --> 02:16:07,930
Jack the core into the power armor and grab that minigun.

3328
02:16:08,010 --> 02:16:10,010
Those raiders will know they picked the wrong fight.

3329
02:16:10,890 --> 02:16:11,610
Good luck.

3330
02:16:13,710 --> 02:16:14,890
I did it, guys.

3331
02:16:15,530 --> 02:16:16,570
I did it.

3332
02:16:17,570 --> 02:16:18,430
You okay?

3333
02:16:18,690 --> 02:16:19,650
What's going on?

3334
02:16:19,670 --> 02:16:20,410
Careful, kid...

3335
02:16:20,410 --> 02:16:21,150
Are we getting out of here?

3336
02:16:22,010 --> 02:16:23,010
Mama Murphy.

3337
02:16:23,130 --> 02:16:23,950
Hello, Mama Murphy.

3338
02:16:25,550 --> 02:16:27,090
Oh, I didn't give him her name!

3339
02:16:27,630 --> 02:16:28,130
Just look at you.

3340
02:16:29,690 --> 02:16:30,190
Dogmeat?

3341
02:16:30,510 --> 02:16:31,650
He's a good boy.

3342
02:16:31,990 --> 02:16:32,290
He's a good dog.

3343
02:16:32,730 --> 02:16:33,550
Smart too.

3344
02:16:33,910 --> 02:16:34,570
Oh, indeed.

3345
02:16:36,030 --> 02:16:38,610
Dogmeat's good at finding folks who need him.

3346
02:16:38,710 --> 02:16:40,470
And he'll stick by you now.

3347
02:16:40,750 --> 02:16:41,110
See?

3348
02:16:41,390 --> 02:16:42,330
Saw it.

3349
02:16:43,770 --> 02:16:44,790
You saw it?

3350
02:16:45,150 --> 02:16:46,210
You saw it.

3351
02:16:46,990 --> 02:16:48,230
It's the chems, kid.

3352
02:16:48,530 --> 02:16:51,050
They give old Mama Murphy...

3353
02:16:51,050 --> 02:16:54,230
Oh, she ain't... She's not been okay for a while.

3354
02:16:54,510 --> 02:16:55,510
...as long as I can remember.

3355
02:16:59,460 --> 02:17:00,140
The sight?

3356
02:17:00,460 --> 02:17:00,960
What's the sight?

3357
02:17:01,440 --> 02:17:06,260
I can see a bit of what was and what will be.

3358
02:17:06,880 --> 02:17:09,860
And even what is...

3359
02:17:10,240 --> 02:17:11,340
Oh yeah, where's Sean?

3360
02:17:11,580 --> 02:17:12,640
Where's my kid?

3361
02:17:14,140 --> 02:17:14,820
I

3362
02:17:17,920 --> 02:17:21,260
can see this something coming.

3363
02:17:21,260 --> 02:17:22,280
Are they all bulletproof?

3364
02:17:22,380 --> 02:17:24,200
Just like, I need to be sure.

3365
02:17:24,660 --> 02:17:26,340
If I don't want to accidentally...

3366
02:17:35,160 --> 02:17:35,580
What?

3367
02:17:37,460 --> 02:17:38,700
Oh, it can't be me.

3368
02:17:38,740 --> 02:17:39,180
I'm perfect.

3369
02:17:39,640 --> 02:17:40,400
What is it?

3370
02:17:45,400 --> 02:17:45,820
What?!

3371
02:17:47,780 --> 02:17:48,920
How did it fail?

3372
02:17:49,040 --> 02:17:49,920
Look at me!

3373
02:17:52,240 --> 02:17:54,200
Might as well be intimidation!

3374
02:17:54,640 --> 02:17:57,700
...when I tell you it ain't a radar.

3375
02:17:58,940 --> 02:17:59,580
But

3376
02:18:05,460 --> 02:18:07,140
I'm tired now.

3377
02:18:07,340 --> 02:18:07,600
What?

3378
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:11,200
Even me and my one charisma didn't persuade her!

3379
02:18:11,780 --> 02:18:13,900
You have a job to do.

3380
02:18:15,820 --> 02:18:17,400
I don't understand!

3381
02:18:18,440 --> 02:18:21,600
Me and my one charisma should have worked!

3382
02:18:24,540 --> 02:18:25,500
You alright?

3383
02:18:26,260 --> 02:18:28,460
Oh hey, there's a Pip-Boy.

3384
02:18:29,160 --> 02:18:30,140
Oh, you're a person?

3385
02:18:30,520 --> 02:18:31,880
It's been permanently creased by one!

3386
02:18:32,180 --> 02:18:32,520
Yay!

3387
02:18:33,280 --> 02:18:34,520
No, no, no, no!

3388
02:18:35,320 --> 02:18:36,200
No Rhys?

3389
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:37,880
There's two...

3390
02:18:37,880 --> 02:18:38,840
Where do I go now?

3391
02:18:40,220 --> 02:18:41,320
Oh yeah, we gotta go up.

3392
02:18:41,500 --> 02:18:42,240
How do I go up?

3393
02:18:44,020 --> 02:18:47,340
Let's see... Do I still want the radio on or should I turn it off, chat?

3394
02:18:48,180 --> 02:18:49,320
Oh yeah, it's two now.

3395
02:18:51,300 --> 02:18:53,160
There's literally no Rhys.

3396
02:19:06,780 --> 02:19:07,620
Alright, loading.

3397
02:19:08,560 --> 02:19:09,260
Radio on?

3398
02:19:09,440 --> 02:19:10,340
Alright, we'll keep it on.

3399
02:19:10,680 --> 02:19:11,920
It's not too distracting, right?

3400
02:19:13,180 --> 02:19:15,940
It's crazy that you have this little wrist.

3401
02:19:18,180 --> 02:19:22,500
You mean putting it all on straight was not the right idea?

3402
02:19:22,800 --> 02:19:24,220
No way.

3403
02:19:24,400 --> 02:19:25,440
That can't be true.

3404
02:19:26,440 --> 02:19:30,820
All those gym bros told me it was cool.

3405
02:19:31,160 --> 02:19:32,540
That's how you get on the ladies.

3406
02:19:34,320 --> 02:19:36,660
My god, the loading time is fucking insane.

3407
02:19:36,660 --> 02:19:38,580
Michael, thank you for the super chat.

3408
02:19:38,660 --> 02:19:38,900
Thank you.

3409
02:19:38,940 --> 02:19:39,480
Thank you.

3410
02:19:39,480 --> 02:19:42,020
You should raise your endurance to 5 then get Aqua Girl.

3411
02:19:42,200 --> 02:19:44,180
Water can't hurt your radiation anymore.

3412
02:19:44,340 --> 02:19:45,800
Only if you drink it you can swim.

3413
02:19:46,480 --> 02:19:47,280
Okie dokie.

3414
02:19:47,740 --> 02:19:48,800
Thank you for the super chat.

3415
02:19:48,920 --> 02:19:49,160
Thank you.

3416
02:19:49,220 --> 02:19:49,720
Thank you.

3417
02:19:50,640 --> 02:19:51,580
Oh my god.

3418
02:19:52,300 --> 02:19:54,120
What the fuck is this loading time?

3419
02:19:54,400 --> 02:19:55,900
What the fuck?

3420
02:19:59,240 --> 02:20:00,320
No, it's moving.

3421
02:20:00,460 --> 02:20:00,840
See?

3422
02:20:01,060 --> 02:20:01,340
Look.

3423
02:20:01,720 --> 02:20:02,700
I told you.

3424
02:20:02,860 --> 02:20:03,560
It's moving.

3425
02:20:03,760 --> 02:20:04,780
It's night time now?

3426
02:20:04,860 --> 02:20:05,360
Is this canon?

3427
02:20:06,660 --> 02:20:07,880
Or did I just take too long?

3428
02:20:11,560 --> 02:20:12,460
Alright, here we go.

3429
02:20:16,600 --> 02:20:17,340
Oh shit.

3430
02:20:17,720 --> 02:20:18,740
I got the mini gun.

3431
02:20:19,580 --> 02:20:20,920
Ok, we gotta grab the scissors.

3432
02:20:21,520 --> 02:20:22,580
Am I getting shot at?

3433
02:20:24,960 --> 02:20:25,460
It's ok.

3434
02:20:25,620 --> 02:20:25,980
We're fine.

3435
02:20:26,080 --> 02:20:27,060
Look at my mini gun though.

3436
02:20:27,880 --> 02:20:30,320
Wait, where's the power armor?

3437
02:20:33,900 --> 02:20:34,300
Wait.

3438
02:20:34,300 --> 02:20:35,140
It's over here?

3439
02:20:36,080 --> 02:20:38,240
Where am I supposed to... Wait, give me a sec.

3440
02:20:39,080 --> 02:20:39,920
Dogmeat, please.

3441
02:20:40,080 --> 02:20:41,040
I need to go down.

3442
02:20:41,220 --> 02:20:42,260
There's something over here.

3443
02:20:42,340 --> 02:20:43,440
Oh, there's... whoops.

3444
02:20:43,720 --> 02:20:48,860
Guys, I forgot to... I missed the... I thought that was a person.

3445
02:20:55,420 --> 02:21:02,120
I legitimately thought... I legitimately thought that was a person so I walked past it.

3446
02:21:03,780 --> 02:21:04,520
Don't worry.

3447
02:21:04,700 --> 02:21:06,600
I got my power armor now.

3448
02:21:06,600 --> 02:21:08,500
Wait, where's Daria?

3449
02:21:08,580 --> 02:21:09,960
I got my mini gun.

3450
02:21:12,360 --> 02:21:13,640
Doki, smash!

3451
02:21:14,540 --> 02:21:16,600
Wait, is that... Ok, I was gonna say it.

3452
02:21:16,700 --> 02:21:20,160
I hope I didn't accidentally shoot the wrong person again.

3453
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,340
Doki is ready to smash!

3454
02:21:27,660 --> 02:21:29,400
Get over here.

3455
02:21:32,360 --> 02:21:33,660
Where is he?

3456
02:21:36,600 --> 02:21:37,320
I'll loot you.

3457
02:21:37,520 --> 02:21:38,080
Nice.

3458
02:21:38,820 --> 02:21:39,980
Wait, what's that sound?

3459
02:21:40,540 --> 02:21:41,100
Oh!

3460
02:21:41,920 --> 02:21:43,320
Oh, fuck!

3461
02:21:43,920 --> 02:21:44,760
Oh, it's ok.

3462
02:21:44,880 --> 02:21:45,120
It's ok.

3463
02:21:45,840 --> 02:21:47,380
I can't shoot it.

3464
02:21:47,420 --> 02:21:48,860
I have so much strength.

3465
02:21:49,280 --> 02:21:50,860
Oh, I can take this.

3466
02:21:51,920 --> 02:21:52,480
Oh!

3467
02:21:52,480 --> 02:21:53,180
It's alright.

3468
02:21:53,440 --> 02:21:55,400
If I just... Oh, shit!

3469
02:21:55,860 --> 02:21:56,420
Bro!

3470
02:21:57,900 --> 02:21:58,460
Wow!

3471
02:21:58,460 --> 02:21:59,020
Wow!

3472
02:21:59,080 --> 02:22:01,160
He's fucking beating me up.

3473
02:22:01,540 --> 02:22:02,620
Oh, shit!

3474
02:22:03,080 --> 02:22:04,140
Dogmeat, do something!

3475
02:22:09,950 --> 02:22:10,830
Oh!

3476
02:22:10,930 --> 02:22:13,370
Oh, guys, I don't feel ok.

3477
02:22:13,750 --> 02:22:15,970
I don't... Guys!

3478
02:22:16,290 --> 02:22:18,850
I don't feel ok, guys.

3479
02:22:19,090 --> 02:22:19,770
Guys.

3480
02:22:19,950 --> 02:22:21,710
What's my stim pack?

3481
02:22:21,910 --> 02:22:22,410
0.

3482
02:22:22,690 --> 02:22:23,230
Ok.

3483
02:22:25,250 --> 02:22:26,130
Alright,

3484
02:22:32,570 --> 02:22:34,870
so what I learned...

3485
02:22:35,690 --> 02:22:39,110
What I learned is that...

3486
02:22:39,110 --> 02:22:40,010
Death Claws.

3487
02:22:40,010 --> 02:22:42,510
I forgot how strong Deathclaws are, guys.

3488
02:22:46,390 --> 02:22:47,550
That was...

3489
02:22:49,210 --> 02:22:52,890
That was a little bit of a skill-tiff there.

3490
02:22:58,030 --> 02:22:58,790
It's okay.

3491
02:22:59,210 --> 02:23:00,110
Round 2.

3492
02:23:00,850 --> 02:23:01,690
Round 2.

3493
02:23:01,750 --> 02:23:02,570
Rematch time!

3494
02:23:05,510 --> 02:23:06,290
It's okay.

3495
02:23:06,330 --> 02:23:07,790
This is why we have Round 2.

3496
02:23:10,790 --> 02:23:11,250
Weeeee!

3497
02:23:14,870 --> 02:23:15,910
Where is he?

3498
02:23:16,430 --> 02:23:18,850
This is just like the Fallout 2.

3499
02:23:19,770 --> 02:23:20,430
Oh wait!

3500
02:23:20,470 --> 02:23:20,810
You're right!

3501
02:23:20,850 --> 02:23:21,170
VATS!

3502
02:23:21,190 --> 02:23:21,870
What was VATS again?

3503
02:23:22,190 --> 02:23:23,950
What button activates VATS?

3504
02:23:24,030 --> 02:23:24,990
It never taught me.

3505
02:23:27,950 --> 02:23:28,410
Okay.

3506
02:23:31,430 --> 02:23:32,310
What the fuck?

3507
02:23:32,330 --> 02:23:33,650
Why is this guy not taking damage?

3508
02:23:34,130 --> 02:23:35,430
That was a lot of bullets.

3509
02:23:36,910 --> 02:23:37,710
Alright, don't worry.

3510
02:23:37,770 --> 02:23:38,770
He's gonna boost out here.

3511
02:23:40,010 --> 02:23:40,270
There we go.

3512
02:23:40,410 --> 02:23:40,890
Alright.

3513
02:23:41,490 --> 02:23:43,030
It's Q or...

3514
02:23:43,030 --> 02:23:44,370
Alright, give me a sec.

3515
02:23:44,430 --> 02:23:45,170
Just reloading.

3516
02:23:45,250 --> 02:23:46,350
Just reloading.

3517
02:23:46,350 --> 02:23:47,250
There he is.

3518
02:23:47,290 --> 02:23:48,310
He's coming over now.

3519
02:23:48,750 --> 02:23:49,810
I hear him.

3520
02:23:52,930 --> 02:23:53,890
There he is.

3521
02:23:55,090 --> 02:23:56,010
Alright, don't worry.

3522
02:23:56,110 --> 02:23:57,110
He doesn't see me yet.

3523
02:23:57,190 --> 02:23:58,030
He doesn't see me.

3524
02:23:58,050 --> 02:23:59,230
Do you think he sees me?

3525
02:23:59,590 --> 02:24:01,050
I don't think so.

3526
02:24:01,670 --> 02:24:02,630
DARVIK, NOOOO!

3527
02:24:04,990 --> 02:24:05,870
Oh my god.

3528
02:24:05,970 --> 02:24:06,850
Oh, 69!

3529
02:24:07,610 --> 02:24:08,090
69!

3530
02:24:08,690 --> 02:24:10,450
Where's the head?

3531
02:24:10,830 --> 02:24:11,970
There's a belly?

3532
02:24:12,150 --> 02:24:12,770
HEAD!

3533
02:24:13,330 --> 02:24:14,310
Oh, no.

3534
02:24:15,430 --> 02:24:16,110
Shoot!

3535
02:24:16,450 --> 02:24:16,670
E.

3536
02:24:18,510 --> 02:24:20,890
Guys, I should've fucking did 69.

3537
02:24:21,230 --> 02:24:21,770
I...

3538
02:24:21,770 --> 02:24:23,090
Oh...

3539
02:24:23,090 --> 02:24:23,330
No!

3540
02:24:23,510 --> 02:24:24,470
Not the raider!

3541
02:24:24,910 --> 02:24:25,570
Oh!

3542
02:24:29,070 --> 02:24:29,750
No!

3543
02:24:29,910 --> 02:24:30,830
Not the suplex!

3544
02:24:34,700 --> 02:24:36,100
Oh my god!

3545
02:24:38,380 --> 02:24:40,120
You can't go in the building!

3546
02:24:40,180 --> 02:24:40,860
He's too thick!

3547
02:24:41,740 --> 02:24:42,820
That's fucking right.

3548
02:24:42,880 --> 02:24:44,360
I know you can't enter the building.

3549
02:24:44,480 --> 02:24:45,780
You're way too fucking thick.

3550
02:24:46,080 --> 02:24:47,360
That's fucking right.

3551
02:24:47,500 --> 02:24:48,980
I knew it.

3552
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:50,480
What you gonna do?

3553
02:24:50,640 --> 02:24:53,380
You're way too wide for this building.

3554
02:24:53,460 --> 02:24:55,380
What the fuck he glitched in?

3555
02:24:56,280 --> 02:24:57,100
That's illegal!

3556
02:25:07,240 --> 02:25:10,060
He actually glitched in!

3557
02:25:10,060 --> 02:25:10,200
He glitched in?!

3558
02:25:10,200 --> 02:25:11,860
TIE!

3559
02:25:13,040 --> 02:25:13,940
WHAT?!

3560
02:25:15,700 --> 02:25:17,080
He got in.

3561
02:25:17,200 --> 02:25:17,960
Oh jeez.

3562
02:25:17,960 --> 02:25:21,340
He actually forced himself in.

3563
02:25:21,650 --> 02:25:23,420
All these things.

3564
02:25:23,640 --> 02:25:24,200
TIE.

3565
02:25:24,220 --> 02:25:26,400
He had TIE cheese.

3566
02:25:26,740 --> 02:25:28,280
Oh my god!

3567
02:25:30,820 --> 02:25:32,520
He pulled it off.

3568
02:25:32,780 --> 02:25:37,080
He fucking no-clipped inside the door!

3569
02:25:37,080 --> 02:25:40,180
How the fuck did he do that?

3570
02:25:43,060 --> 02:25:44,520
Oh my god!

3571
02:25:45,160 --> 02:25:48,280
That's actually crazy that that happened!

3572
02:25:48,440 --> 02:25:49,260
I did not...

3573
02:25:49,260 --> 02:25:51,260
I just casted Q.

3574
02:25:51,920 --> 02:25:53,580
It just works.

3575
02:25:53,740 --> 02:25:54,700
It just works.

3576
02:25:54,900 --> 02:25:56,180
It just works.

3577
02:25:57,440 --> 02:26:00,180
I didn't think that was possible!

3578
02:26:03,050 --> 02:26:06,450
I didn't think you could actually noclip inside!

3579
02:26:09,750 --> 02:26:11,050
Oh my god, fuck this.

3580
02:26:11,150 --> 02:26:12,790
I'm just gonna...

3581
02:26:12,790 --> 02:26:14,670
Then I'm gonna run.

3582
02:26:15,110 --> 02:26:16,270
Then I'm gonna run.

3583
02:26:16,730 --> 02:26:17,770
I'm gonna run.

3584
02:26:18,270 --> 02:26:19,710
It just works.

3585
02:26:19,950 --> 02:26:20,930
It just works.

3586
02:26:21,250 --> 02:26:21,730
Okay.

3587
02:26:22,050 --> 02:26:23,030
Apparently it's belly.

3588
02:26:23,570 --> 02:26:24,090
Alright.

3589
02:26:25,530 --> 02:26:26,950
Guys, do you think I hit it?

3590
02:26:31,170 --> 02:26:32,530
Oh my god!

3591
02:26:32,970 --> 02:26:36,150
I can't believe he forced himself inside!

3592
02:26:36,950 --> 02:26:37,470
No!

3593
02:26:38,830 --> 02:26:40,470
Where the fuck is this belly?

3594
02:26:41,550 --> 02:26:42,070
Head.

3595
02:26:42,070 --> 02:26:42,590
Belly.

3596
02:26:43,490 --> 02:26:44,010
Pew!

3597
02:26:45,270 --> 02:26:45,790
Oh!

3598
02:26:45,790 --> 02:26:46,930
I'm gonna do this again!

3599
02:26:47,110 --> 02:26:48,190
It's gonna work this time!

3600
02:26:50,590 --> 02:26:51,550
There's no way.

3601
02:26:51,910 --> 02:26:53,770
There's no way he'll clip in again.

3602
02:26:54,530 --> 02:26:56,110
There's no fucking way.

3603
02:26:56,390 --> 02:26:57,250
Wait, he's gone.

3604
02:26:57,990 --> 02:26:59,430
Wait, did I despawn him?

3605
02:27:02,950 --> 02:27:03,910
I did it.

3606
02:27:05,510 --> 02:27:06,730
I despawned him.

3607
02:27:07,610 --> 02:27:08,130
What?

3608
02:27:09,150 --> 02:27:09,670
Hahaha!

3609
02:27:12,960 --> 02:27:13,480
Nice.

3610
02:27:13,480 --> 02:27:15,060
Oh my god, I did it!

3611
02:27:15,140 --> 02:27:16,400
He just left!

3612
02:27:17,320 --> 02:27:19,120
Guys, he just fucking left!

3613
02:27:20,040 --> 02:27:21,100
What the fuck happened?

3614
02:27:22,500 --> 02:27:23,580
He ran off.

3615
02:27:23,660 --> 02:27:24,160
He knew.

3616
02:27:24,300 --> 02:27:24,940
He was so...

3617
02:27:24,940 --> 02:27:25,280
Wooo!

3618
02:27:25,580 --> 02:27:26,100
Shit!

3619
02:27:26,580 --> 02:27:27,360
He bit!

3620
02:27:27,520 --> 02:27:28,600
Oh my god!

3621
02:27:29,140 --> 02:27:30,900
Bro, he fucking left again!

3622
02:27:31,380 --> 02:27:32,560
He fucking...

3623
02:27:35,340 --> 02:27:36,040
It's like...

3624
02:27:36,040 --> 02:27:38,140
It's like fucking... I see you!

3625
02:27:38,540 --> 02:27:39,560
It's like green light.

3626
02:27:39,720 --> 02:27:40,980
It's green light, red light!

3627
02:27:40,980 --> 02:27:43,160
Bro, he's flipped a car!

3628
02:27:45,460 --> 02:27:47,040
Oh my god, you just know...

3629
02:27:47,040 --> 02:27:49,720
There's no way you're gonna phase through that door again!

3630
02:27:49,980 --> 02:27:51,480
There's no fucking way!

3631
02:27:51,660 --> 02:27:53,600
You're gonna do that to me again!

3632
02:27:54,640 --> 02:27:55,160
Hahaha!

3633
02:27:56,760 --> 02:27:58,300
He's on predator mode.

3634
02:28:00,240 --> 02:28:01,420
Wait, where did he go?

3635
02:28:03,360 --> 02:28:04,180
Okay, nice.

3636
02:28:04,260 --> 02:28:05,280
He's only...

3637
02:28:06,440 --> 02:28:07,380
I don't even...

3638
02:28:07,380 --> 02:28:08,600
I can't see... Oh, there's my ammo.

3639
02:28:09,800 --> 02:28:10,720
There's no way.

3640
02:28:10,720 --> 02:28:12,680
There's no way I'm going up the stairs.

3641
02:28:12,820 --> 02:28:13,980
There's no way I'll cheese him.

3642
02:28:19,100 --> 02:28:21,000
Get fucking cheesed!

3643
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:22,320
You fucking whore!

3644
02:28:24,680 --> 02:28:25,160
Okay.

3645
02:28:26,340 --> 02:28:26,820
Nice.

3646
02:28:29,160 --> 02:28:29,880
There you go.

3647
02:28:30,100 --> 02:28:31,260
I'll shoot him from here.

3648
02:28:31,320 --> 02:28:32,940
I'm not scared of cheesing.

3649
02:28:33,640 --> 02:28:34,600
Alright, reloading.

3650
02:28:37,020 --> 02:28:37,980
Not even...

3651
02:28:37,980 --> 02:28:39,840
It's in for the hunt!

3652
02:28:40,720 --> 02:28:42,280
Thank you for the super chat.

3653
02:28:42,420 --> 02:28:42,740
Thank you.

3654
02:28:43,640 --> 02:28:44,700
Where did he go?

3655
02:28:45,140 --> 02:28:46,880
He's in predator mode again.

3656
02:28:46,940 --> 02:28:47,700
Where did he go?

3657
02:28:47,860 --> 02:28:49,540
I hate it when he does this!

3658
02:28:49,900 --> 02:28:52,780
Just fucking show up and let me shoot you!

3659
02:28:53,500 --> 02:28:54,020
Like...

3660
02:28:55,200 --> 02:28:56,200
Where did he go?

3661
02:28:56,720 --> 02:28:58,580
He's in predator mode again!

3662
02:28:58,780 --> 02:28:59,500
Where did he...

3663
02:28:59,500 --> 02:28:59,740
Hahaha!

3664
02:29:03,600 --> 02:29:05,080
Get up, dogmeat.

3665
02:29:05,100 --> 02:29:06,540
I know you have self-heal.

3666
02:29:06,940 --> 02:29:08,260
I don't like this.

3667
02:29:08,840 --> 02:29:10,520
I don't know where he is.

3668
02:29:10,720 --> 02:29:11,920
No, don't whimper!

3669
02:29:12,420 --> 02:29:14,760
Makes me sad when you whimper!

3670
02:29:15,580 --> 02:29:16,060
Okay.

3671
02:29:17,660 --> 02:29:19,000
I know you're just...

3672
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:19,840
Oh, no.

3673
02:29:19,940 --> 02:29:20,660
There he is.

3674
02:29:21,560 --> 02:29:22,560
There he is.

3675
02:29:22,640 --> 02:29:25,880
I have too much junk in my fucking inventory now.

3676
02:29:26,180 --> 02:29:27,000
Oh, no.

3677
02:29:27,180 --> 02:29:27,680
Okay, wait.

3678
02:29:27,780 --> 02:29:28,520
I just gotta eat.

3679
02:29:28,880 --> 02:29:30,540
If I eat, it'll be okay.

3680
02:29:31,120 --> 02:29:32,700
Alright, let's get some...

3681
02:29:32,700 --> 02:29:33,080
Oh, hey.

3682
02:29:33,320 --> 02:29:34,860
It gives me like...

3683
02:29:34,860 --> 02:29:35,920
It makes me smarter.

3684
02:29:36,280 --> 02:29:37,040
You know what?

3685
02:29:37,140 --> 02:29:39,240
I can eat a little bit of a...

3686
02:29:39,240 --> 02:29:39,720
...roll.

3687
02:29:39,900 --> 02:29:40,640
Okay, let's see.

3688
02:29:40,720 --> 02:29:42,440
0.5, 0.1...

3689
02:29:42,440 --> 02:29:44,280
Alright, we need to get rid of stuff.

3690
02:29:44,400 --> 02:29:46,080
We need to start getting...

3691
02:29:46,610 --> 02:29:48,380
...rid of stuff right now.

3692
02:29:49,320 --> 02:29:50,420
Okay, let's see.

3693
02:29:50,460 --> 02:29:51,120
The iron.

3694
02:29:51,320 --> 02:29:52,460
Oh, that's like plus two.

3695
02:29:52,640 --> 02:29:54,880
Okay, we gotta... How do I throw this away?

3696
02:29:55,320 --> 02:29:55,780
Drop.

3697
02:29:56,040 --> 02:29:57,220
Alright, we're gonna drop this.

3698
02:29:58,580 --> 02:29:59,500
And then...

3699
02:29:59,500 --> 02:30:01,840
No, we do not put out our pistol.

3700
02:30:02,380 --> 02:30:02,840
Hahaha!

3701
02:30:04,280 --> 02:30:05,680
Wait, where's my minigun?

3702
02:30:07,940 --> 02:30:08,400
Oh!

3703
02:30:09,540 --> 02:30:10,100
Hahaha!

3704
02:30:11,200 --> 02:30:14,380
I never dare doki to go to...

3705
02:30:14,380 --> 02:30:16,220
...fist fight the Deathclaw.

3706
02:30:16,620 --> 02:30:18,260
Treasure, thank you for the...

3707
02:30:18,980 --> 02:30:19,540
...akasupa.

3708
02:30:19,560 --> 02:30:20,320
Thank you.

3709
02:30:20,520 --> 02:30:21,000
Thank you.

3710
02:30:21,220 --> 02:30:22,380
Okay, give me...

3711
02:30:22,380 --> 02:30:23,080
...a sec, guys.

3712
02:30:23,440 --> 02:30:24,380
I need to...

3713
02:30:24,380 --> 02:30:25,800
...figure out how to...

3714
02:30:27,460 --> 02:30:28,300
Where is he?

3715
02:30:29,200 --> 02:30:30,320
Where's my...

3716
02:30:30,320 --> 02:30:30,580
...minigun?

3717
02:30:30,680 --> 02:30:31,220
Oh, there it is.

3718
02:30:31,320 --> 02:30:31,540
Okay.

3719
02:30:32,140 --> 02:30:33,020
I shot him.

3720
02:30:33,200 --> 02:30:33,960
Where is he?

3721
02:30:34,820 --> 02:30:36,320
Oh my god!

3722
02:30:36,480 --> 02:30:38,300
Okay, we're gonna fist fight him.

3723
02:30:38,400 --> 02:30:39,520
When he's a little lower.

3724
02:30:41,080 --> 02:30:41,540
Okay.

3725
02:30:41,920 --> 02:30:42,580
Don't worry.

3726
02:30:42,860 --> 02:30:44,340
Bro, he tried to fist fight my...

3727
02:30:44,340 --> 02:30:44,520
...dog!

3728
02:30:45,880 --> 02:30:46,780
Don't worry, guys.

3729
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:47,600
Alright, you guys ready?

3730
02:30:48,340 --> 02:30:49,040
I'm ready.

3731
02:30:50,280 --> 02:30:51,960
Wait, how do I... Okay, I'm ready.

3732
02:30:52,240 --> 02:30:52,960
This is it.

3733
02:30:53,540 --> 02:30:54,400
I've trained...

3734
02:30:54,400 --> 02:30:54,660
...for this.

3735
02:30:55,400 --> 02:30:56,240
This is it.

3736
02:30:57,080 --> 02:30:57,720
Fight me.

3737
02:30:57,960 --> 02:30:59,320
I got you one HP.

3738
02:30:59,420 --> 02:30:59,880
It's time.

3739
02:31:00,520 --> 02:31:00,980
Hahaha!

3740
02:31:02,140 --> 02:31:02,520
Hahaha!

3741
02:31:04,140 --> 02:31:05,760
I got you one HP.

3742
02:31:06,340 --> 02:31:07,480
It's fucking time.

3743
02:31:08,400 --> 02:31:10,160
Get over here, Deathclaw.

3744
02:31:10,460 --> 02:31:11,840
Bro, he came back!

3745
02:31:12,140 --> 02:31:12,700
Oh!

3746
02:31:13,340 --> 02:31:13,900
Oh!

3747
02:31:25,110 --> 02:31:26,230
Oh my...

3748
02:31:26,230 --> 02:31:27,170
Oh my god.

3749
02:31:27,970 --> 02:31:29,970
Guys, I think I made a mistake!

3750
02:31:35,140 --> 02:31:36,760
Guys, I absolutely...

3751
02:31:36,760 --> 02:31:38,680
...made a mistake, but what if I just...

3752
02:31:38,680 --> 02:31:39,320
...fight him here?

3753
02:31:42,540 --> 02:31:44,300
Oh my god!

3754
02:31:45,720 --> 02:31:46,080
Okay.

3755
02:31:46,480 --> 02:31:47,100
It's okay.

3756
02:31:47,100 --> 02:31:51,600
How does he have a longer range than me?!

3757
02:31:51,600 --> 02:31:51,620
How does he have a longer range than me?!

3758
02:31:52,790 --> 02:31:53,200
Oh!

3759
02:31:53,880 --> 02:31:54,520
Oh!

3760
02:31:57,980 --> 02:31:58,380
Oh!

3761
02:32:00,160 --> 02:32:01,940
How does he...

3762
02:32:01,940 --> 02:32:03,720
He has a longer range!

3763
02:32:03,780 --> 02:32:04,720
It's not fair!

3764
02:32:06,660 --> 02:32:07,480
Oh!

3765
02:32:07,700 --> 02:32:08,000
Oh!

3766
02:32:09,160 --> 02:32:11,460
Guys, I'm running out of stims.

3767
02:32:11,460 --> 02:32:13,350
I'm running out of stims.

3768
02:32:14,060 --> 02:32:14,860
Guys, I'm running out of stims.

3769
02:32:14,860 --> 02:32:15,840
Have you seen it?

3770
02:32:15,840 --> 02:32:17,580
Have you seen his arm?

3771
02:32:17,800 --> 02:32:18,360
This is gonna work.

3772
02:32:18,420 --> 02:32:19,720
This is for the Akasupa.

3773
02:32:20,620 --> 02:32:21,820
Oh my god!

3774
02:32:21,840 --> 02:32:22,900
This is not okay!

3775
02:32:23,580 --> 02:32:25,200
This is not okay!

3776
02:32:26,280 --> 02:32:26,420
Hahaha!

3777
02:32:28,060 --> 02:32:28,540
Hahaha!

3778
02:32:31,440 --> 02:32:32,780
Oh my god!

3779
02:32:34,040 --> 02:32:35,220
Okay, don't worry.

3780
02:32:35,340 --> 02:32:36,040
I can do this.

3781
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:37,760
Come back.

3782
02:32:38,580 --> 02:32:39,300
Come back.

3783
02:32:39,400 --> 02:32:40,140
I got this.

3784
02:32:40,160 --> 02:32:42,300
I'm gonna use VATS for my fist.

3785
02:32:44,860 --> 02:32:45,820
I got this.

3786
02:32:45,820 --> 02:32:45,820
I'm gonna use VATS for my fist.

3787
02:32:45,820 --> 02:32:46,180
Boom.

3788
02:32:47,420 --> 02:32:48,060
Oh!

3789
02:32:48,600 --> 02:32:49,240
Oh!

3790
02:32:51,600 --> 02:32:51,920
Did

3791
02:32:56,260 --> 02:32:56,740
it!

3792
02:32:57,420 --> 02:32:58,060
Hahaha!

3793
02:33:00,780 --> 02:33:01,900
There we go.

3794
02:33:02,180 --> 02:33:06,400
We might have used a lot of our stims, guys.

3795
02:33:06,740 --> 02:33:07,580
We might have used a lot of our stims, guys.

3796
02:33:07,580 --> 02:33:08,260
The combo.

3797
02:33:08,840 --> 02:33:10,480
We fucking did it.

3798
02:33:10,580 --> 02:33:11,480
We lost a lot.

3799
02:33:11,740 --> 02:33:12,760
But we did it.

3800
02:33:12,780 --> 02:33:14,040
Not even close.

3801
02:33:14,440 --> 02:33:17,300
I definitely have like zero stims.

3802
02:33:17,660 --> 02:33:18,300
Hahaha!

3803
02:33:19,160 --> 02:33:20,660
This is John Cena!

3804
02:33:22,040 --> 02:33:23,300
Alright, it was worth it.

3805
02:33:23,780 --> 02:33:25,360
It was fucking worth it, guys.

3806
02:33:25,580 --> 02:33:27,480
Yeah, I don't have stims anymore, guys.

3807
02:33:27,740 --> 02:33:29,620
I don't have stims anymore.

3808
02:33:30,460 --> 02:33:30,960
Hahaha!

3809
02:33:31,900 --> 02:33:32,080
Hahaha!

3810
02:33:32,600 --> 02:33:33,100
Um.

3811
02:33:34,280 --> 02:33:35,800
Alright, Doki smash.

3812
02:33:36,080 --> 02:33:38,960
I knew investing in strength was the way to go, guys.

3813
02:33:39,280 --> 02:33:40,620
I fucking knew it.

3814
02:33:40,820 --> 02:33:42,300
Alright, we gotta get rid of stuff.

3815
02:33:42,480 --> 02:33:44,380
We actually have too much junk now.

3816
02:33:45,860 --> 02:33:46,360
Uhhhhhhh.

3817
02:33:46,820 --> 02:33:48,280
But what can we get rid of?

3818
02:33:48,300 --> 02:33:50,320
Everything is so important!

3819
02:33:52,500 --> 02:33:54,600
Everything is so important though!

3820
02:33:55,500 --> 02:33:56,420
5-4?

3821
02:33:56,700 --> 02:33:57,280
Nice.

3822
02:33:57,880 --> 02:33:59,720
I don't know what to get rid of.

3823
02:33:59,980 --> 02:34:02,360
Okay, we could get rid of...

3824
02:34:02,360 --> 02:34:05,400
Bro, all these guns are so important!

3825
02:34:05,940 --> 02:34:06,580
Bro, all these guns are so important!

3826
02:34:06,920 --> 02:34:07,880
Eat the food?

3827
02:34:08,580 --> 02:34:09,180
Okay, wait.

3828
02:34:09,240 --> 02:34:10,520
But the food won't help!

3829
02:34:12,240 --> 02:34:13,720
Get rid of the power armor?

3830
02:34:14,100 --> 02:34:15,860
Do I just take off my armor?

3831
02:34:16,600 --> 02:34:17,840
Okay, a pair of...

3832
02:34:18,500 --> 02:34:19,360
Where is it?

3833
02:34:20,120 --> 02:34:21,460
How do I get out of it?

3834
02:34:22,960 --> 02:34:24,320
Do you really need five?

3835
02:34:24,540 --> 02:34:24,940
Yes!

3836
02:34:25,420 --> 02:34:25,900
Hahaha!

3837
02:34:27,040 --> 02:34:28,220
Okay, maybe you're right.

3838
02:34:28,280 --> 02:34:28,940
Maybe I should...

3839
02:34:29,960 --> 02:34:32,260
Okay, I'll get rid of one!

3840
02:34:32,400 --> 02:34:33,160
Alright, fine!

3841
02:34:33,500 --> 02:34:33,880
Fine!

3842
02:34:35,460 --> 02:34:36,400
Alright, there you go.

3843
02:34:37,540 --> 02:34:38,020
Fine!

3844
02:34:38,240 --> 02:34:39,620
I'll get rid of it!

3845
02:34:42,220 --> 02:34:43,120
Alright, nice!

3846
02:34:43,660 --> 02:34:44,680
Now I can loot!

3847
02:34:44,680 --> 02:34:47,120
Where was I supposed to go?

3848
02:34:48,060 --> 02:34:48,960
Did I go back?

3849
02:34:51,480 --> 02:34:52,540
Oh, I have to go back!

3850
02:34:52,740 --> 02:34:52,960
Okay.

3851
02:34:53,780 --> 02:34:54,560
Hello guys!

3852
02:34:55,860 --> 02:34:56,700
I'm back!

3853
02:34:56,740 --> 02:34:57,800
Back to the loading screen!

3854
02:34:59,440 --> 02:35:00,780
Are you not entertained?

3855
02:35:01,100 --> 02:35:03,620
I fist-fighted a monster and I lived!

3856
02:35:04,980 --> 02:35:06,200
Andrey, I'll give you a five!

3857
02:35:06,300 --> 02:35:06,840
Give the ships!

3858
02:35:06,940 --> 02:35:07,160
Thank you!

3859
02:35:15,680 --> 02:35:16,940
I did it guys!

3860
02:35:21,010 --> 02:35:21,550
Oh, hey!

3861
02:35:21,930 --> 02:35:22,390
More guns!

3862
02:35:22,410 --> 02:35:22,550
More loot!

3863
02:35:24,930 --> 02:35:28,450
Oh yeah, you saw me run away and then came back to beat him up!

3864
02:35:30,050 --> 02:35:30,690
That's me!

3865
02:35:33,470 --> 02:35:34,470
Is everyone okay?

3866
02:35:52,410 --> 02:35:54,330
Everything you've done, thank you.

3867
02:35:55,610 --> 02:35:56,490
Oh shit!

3868
02:35:56,950 --> 02:35:57,770
Fusion Cell!

3869
02:35:58,010 --> 02:35:58,830
And he gave me money!

3870
02:36:00,230 --> 02:36:01,170
I'll take it!

3871
02:36:01,530 --> 02:36:05,070
You've spoken like a true merc.

3872
02:36:05,950 --> 02:36:10,670
Well, if you ever feel like fighting for something other than yourself, you should meet up with us in Sanctuary.

3873
02:36:10,930 --> 02:36:11,450
Pay me!

3874
02:36:12,130 --> 02:36:13,770
I don't do things for free!

3875
02:36:14,050 --> 02:36:14,770
You don't get things done.

3876
02:36:15,930 --> 02:36:16,590
Doing what?

3877
02:36:19,330 --> 02:36:20,590
What would I need to do?

3878
02:36:20,730 --> 02:36:21,030
Yeah.

3879
02:36:21,230 --> 02:36:22,390
You need to save your life.

3880
02:36:22,410 --> 02:36:24,170
Stay strong like you've been.

3881
02:36:24,550 --> 02:36:27,910
Cause there's more to your destiny.

3882
02:36:28,310 --> 02:36:29,150
There is?

3883
02:36:29,170 --> 02:36:30,470
I've seen it.

3884
02:36:30,890 --> 02:36:33,510
And I know your pain.

3885
02:36:36,270 --> 02:36:37,010
Destiny?

3886
02:36:37,390 --> 02:36:38,590
What's that bullshit?

3887
02:36:39,230 --> 02:36:40,330
What do you mean?

3888
02:36:40,850 --> 02:36:42,670
You are a woman out of time.

3889
02:36:42,910 --> 02:36:44,150
Out of hope.

3890
02:36:44,470 --> 02:36:46,710
But all is not lost.

3891
02:36:47,090 --> 02:36:49,210
My son's alive?

3892
02:36:49,210 --> 02:36:50,450
What's his name?

3893
02:36:51,130 --> 02:36:52,070
He's alive.

3894
02:36:55,790 --> 02:36:56,410
Bullshit.

3895
02:36:56,810 --> 02:36:58,530
You're trying to play me for a fool.

3896
02:36:58,630 --> 02:36:58,770
Yeah.

3897
02:36:58,950 --> 02:37:00,330
What's my son's name?

3898
02:37:01,010 --> 02:37:02,730
The sight's sometimes foggy.

3899
02:37:02,810 --> 02:37:04,850
But it ain't ever a liar.

3900
02:37:05,350 --> 02:37:07,370
Your son's out there.

3901
02:37:07,770 --> 02:37:11,470
And even I don't need the sight to tell you where you should stop.

3902
02:37:11,470 --> 02:37:12,290
Sounds like a scam.

3903
02:37:12,370 --> 02:37:13,730
Like fortune tellers.

3904
02:37:13,870 --> 02:37:16,490
The great green jewel of the commonwealth.

3905
02:37:16,990 --> 02:37:18,110
Diamond City.

3906
02:37:20,110 --> 02:37:21,590
That's where the radio's from.

3907
02:37:24,950 --> 02:37:25,790
Diamond City?

3908
02:37:26,090 --> 02:37:26,150
Diamond City?

3909
02:37:26,150 --> 02:37:26,910
What's in Diamond City?

3910
02:37:27,150 --> 02:37:28,130
Is Sean there?

3911
02:37:28,330 --> 02:37:29,230
Look kid.

3912
02:37:29,670 --> 02:37:31,010
I'm tired now.

3913
02:37:31,690 --> 02:37:32,770
I'm tired?

3914
02:37:33,390 --> 02:37:33,930
Wow!

3915
02:37:34,370 --> 02:37:36,530
The sight will paint a clearer picture.

3916
02:37:37,410 --> 02:37:38,850
Gotta give him an addiction.

3917
02:37:40,770 --> 02:37:42,590
Gotta feed this to get you.

3918
02:37:42,930 --> 02:37:44,910
Why do they always do this to me?

3919
02:37:45,230 --> 02:37:47,750
They give me like a sneak, a tippet.

3920
02:37:48,370 --> 02:37:48,910
No.

3921
02:37:48,970 --> 02:37:49,190
I'm not a tippet.

3922
02:37:49,210 --> 02:37:49,510
Let me in.

3923
02:37:53,330 --> 02:37:55,050
She needs to hook up.

3924
02:37:55,270 --> 02:37:55,650
Alright folks.

3925
02:37:56,170 --> 02:37:57,310
Thanks to our friend here.

3926
02:37:57,690 --> 02:37:58,890
It's safe to move out.

3927
02:37:59,050 --> 02:38:01,110
We're heading for that place Mama Murphy knows about.

3928
02:38:01,590 --> 02:38:02,070
Sanctuary.

3929
02:38:02,150 --> 02:38:03,050
That's my house!

3930
02:38:04,410 --> 02:38:08,310
You mean she had one of her visions while she was stoned out of her gourd.

3931
02:38:08,510 --> 02:38:09,410
Wait that's my house!

3932
02:38:10,470 --> 02:38:11,950
Y'all pay rent for that shit.

3933
02:38:12,310 --> 02:38:14,150
Better plan than Mama Murphy saw it.

3934
02:38:14,250 --> 02:38:15,230
Hold on.

3935
02:38:15,430 --> 02:38:15,530
Hold on.

3936
02:38:16,130 --> 02:38:17,650
Everybody just take it easy.

3937
02:38:17,650 --> 02:38:19,070
We're all in this together.

3938
02:38:19,370 --> 02:38:19,810
Right?

3939
02:38:19,970 --> 02:38:20,830
So Marcy.

3940
02:38:21,270 --> 02:38:23,570
You got a better idea of what we should do next?

3941
02:38:25,430 --> 02:38:26,510
Yeah what do we do next?

3942
02:38:27,590 --> 02:38:29,010
What do we do next Preston?

3943
02:38:29,230 --> 02:38:30,070
Sanctuary it is.

3944
02:38:30,910 --> 02:38:32,850
Let's just hope it lives up to its name.

3945
02:38:34,150 --> 02:38:35,550
Wait what I do?

3946
02:38:35,650 --> 02:38:36,410
I wanna talk!

3947
02:38:37,850 --> 02:38:38,410
Don't worry.

3948
02:38:39,630 --> 02:38:40,990
I'll get these people to Sanctuary.

3949
02:38:42,330 --> 02:38:43,470
We need to keep moving.

3950
02:38:44,630 --> 02:38:45,510
What the fuck?

3951
02:38:48,430 --> 02:38:49,730
They're heading to my place!

3952
02:38:50,070 --> 02:38:51,110
I wanted to pay rent!

3953
02:38:51,270 --> 02:38:52,330
We gotta have a rent agreement!

3954
02:38:56,330 --> 02:38:57,390
We need to have an agreement!

3955
02:39:03,780 --> 02:39:06,100
Look I am the sole survivor of that neighborhood.

3956
02:39:06,280 --> 02:39:07,660
So that makes me queen of the neighborhood.

3957
02:39:08,360 --> 02:39:09,860
That's how it works in suburbia.

3958
02:39:09,960 --> 02:39:11,120
I am the HOA.

3959
02:39:11,200 --> 02:39:12,360
I am the new HOA.

3960
02:39:18,750 --> 02:39:20,690
I am the new landlord now.

3961
02:39:21,550 --> 02:39:22,950
If everybody else is dead.

3962
02:39:23,070 --> 02:39:24,870
That makes me the president of the HOA.

3963
02:39:25,810 --> 02:39:26,630
Cause I'm the last person to be.

3964
02:39:26,650 --> 02:39:26,990
I am the last one.

3965
02:39:30,130 --> 02:39:31,750
I like how like...

3966
02:39:31,750 --> 02:39:33,750
I like how like...

3967
02:39:33,750 --> 02:39:34,870
The radio is still playing.

3968
02:39:35,090 --> 02:39:36,970
But this fucking loading screen is forever.

3969
02:39:37,670 --> 02:39:38,910
Like what?

3970
02:39:39,770 --> 02:39:40,350
Like what?

3971
02:39:47,520 --> 02:39:48,140
Alright.

3972
02:39:49,740 --> 02:39:51,520
We need to keep moving.

3973
02:39:52,480 --> 02:39:53,700
We need to keep moving.

3974
02:39:53,760 --> 02:39:55,280
Oh my god.

3975
02:39:55,320 --> 02:39:56,520
I'll wait for you at the Sanctuary.

3976
02:39:56,860 --> 02:39:58,300
I'm gonna...

3977
02:39:59,940 --> 02:40:00,140
Yes.

3978
02:40:00,940 --> 02:40:02,420
You guys are gonna be there regardless.

3979
02:40:06,840 --> 02:40:07,560
Oh shit.

3980
02:40:07,600 --> 02:40:08,600
Another loading screen.

3981
02:40:08,780 --> 02:40:09,180
Whoops.

3982
02:40:10,980 --> 02:40:11,640
You know what?

3983
02:40:11,700 --> 02:40:13,680
I feel like by the time I get there by walking.

3984
02:40:13,740 --> 02:40:14,780
The loading screen will be over.

3985
02:40:14,980 --> 02:40:15,720
I feel like.

3986
02:40:15,860 --> 02:40:16,640
Not gonna lie.

3987
02:40:19,260 --> 02:40:20,020
Is he here?

3988
02:40:21,840 --> 02:40:22,520
He's not here.

3989
02:40:24,940 --> 02:40:26,960
Is he actually gonna take that long to get here?

3990
02:40:28,060 --> 02:40:29,040
Oh my god.

3991
02:40:29,120 --> 02:40:29,840
Where is he?

3992
02:40:31,880 --> 02:40:32,340
People yet?

3993
02:40:39,820 --> 02:40:40,600
New friends.

3994
02:40:40,780 --> 02:40:43,420
I made a few new friends.

3995
02:40:43,740 --> 02:40:45,480
Can't have enough of those these days.

3996
02:40:45,740 --> 02:40:48,320
I realize that I'm no Mr. Gutsy.

3997
02:40:48,440 --> 02:40:49,540
But if needed.

3998
02:40:49,840 --> 02:40:50,960
I'd be Commonwealth.

3999
02:40:53,650 --> 02:40:53,750
Oh.

4000
02:40:54,990 --> 02:40:56,110
Is he good?

4001
02:40:56,350 --> 02:40:57,370
Your preference?

4002
02:40:57,970 --> 02:40:59,230
As you wish, Mom.

4003
02:41:00,970 --> 02:41:01,610
No.

4004
02:41:03,050 --> 02:41:03,690
No.

4005
02:41:03,690 --> 02:41:03,930
No.

4006
02:41:07,330 --> 02:41:08,070
Not now.

4007
02:41:09,870 --> 02:41:11,450
Is he a good companion?

4008
02:41:13,170 --> 02:41:13,690
Kinda.

4009
02:41:13,830 --> 02:41:14,490
What does he do?

4010
02:41:16,970 --> 02:41:18,210
What does he do?

4011
02:41:18,750 --> 02:41:20,010
What does he do?

4012
02:41:20,190 --> 02:41:21,310
Hey Codsworth.

4013
02:41:21,650 --> 02:41:22,270
Shall I?

4014
02:41:24,970 --> 02:41:25,490
Alright.

4015
02:41:25,610 --> 02:41:26,090
Let's sleep.

4016
02:41:26,370 --> 02:41:27,290
We need to find a bed.

4017
02:41:29,170 --> 02:41:30,570
Where the fuck is a bed?

4018
02:41:31,410 --> 02:41:32,650
Where the fuck is a bed?

4019
02:41:32,650 --> 02:41:33,110
Where the fuck is a bed?

4020
02:41:33,110 --> 02:41:34,810
He can wear a hat?

4021
02:41:34,910 --> 02:41:35,310
Oh my.

4022
02:41:36,630 --> 02:41:37,090
Okay.

4023
02:41:37,190 --> 02:41:37,930
Not gonna lie.

4024
02:41:38,290 --> 02:41:39,750
That's actually very tempting.

4025
02:41:44,150 --> 02:41:44,610
Alright.

4026
02:41:45,010 --> 02:41:46,510
Let's try Codsworth out.

4027
02:41:46,570 --> 02:41:46,990
Where is he?

4028
02:41:47,830 --> 02:41:49,150
Where the fuck did he go?

4029
02:41:49,310 --> 02:41:51,090
What the fuck?

4030
02:41:52,250 --> 02:41:53,990
How could you walk so far?

4031
02:41:55,310 --> 02:41:55,850
What's that?

4032
02:41:57,030 --> 02:41:57,750
No power?

4033
02:41:58,090 --> 02:41:58,670
Oh shit.

4034
02:41:58,710 --> 02:41:59,090
No power.

4035
02:41:59,410 --> 02:41:59,630
Alright.

4036
02:41:59,670 --> 02:42:00,530
We'll just leave this here.

4037
02:42:03,830 --> 02:42:04,230
Alright.

4038
02:42:04,830 --> 02:42:05,230
Codsworth.

4039
02:42:05,490 --> 02:42:06,950
We're gonna make you come over.

4040
02:42:07,650 --> 02:42:08,050
Codsworth.

4041
02:42:08,510 --> 02:42:10,050
Shall I accompany you?

4042
02:42:10,050 --> 02:42:11,630
I want you to wear a funny hat.

4043
02:42:12,790 --> 02:42:14,250
I'd like to trade some items.

4044
02:42:14,510 --> 02:42:14,650
Wait.

4045
02:42:14,730 --> 02:42:16,130
How do I make him wear a hat?

4046
02:42:17,230 --> 02:42:18,030
Do I have hat?

4047
02:42:18,630 --> 02:42:19,210
Where's hat?

4048
02:42:20,510 --> 02:42:21,790
Hat, hat, hat, hat.

4049
02:42:23,150 --> 02:42:23,550
Hat.

4050
02:42:24,830 --> 02:42:25,750
Are you gonna wear it?

4051
02:42:30,060 --> 02:42:30,460
Store?

4052
02:42:30,660 --> 02:42:30,920
Wait.

4053
02:42:30,980 --> 02:42:31,220
No.

4054
02:42:31,340 --> 02:42:32,040
Where's the hat?

4055
02:42:32,340 --> 02:42:33,840
Does he wear a hat if I give him a hat?

4056
02:42:34,040 --> 02:42:34,580
Give him a hat.

4057
02:42:35,540 --> 02:42:36,000
Oh.

4058
02:42:36,200 --> 02:42:36,880
Give it to him?

4059
02:42:37,100 --> 02:42:37,480
Okay.

4060
02:42:39,760 --> 02:42:40,320
Uh...

4061
02:42:41,520 --> 02:42:42,340
Where's the hat?

4062
02:42:42,620 --> 02:42:43,700
I've been lied to.

4063
02:42:44,520 --> 02:42:46,080
I can't believe it.

4064
02:42:46,200 --> 02:42:47,300
I was lied to.

4065
02:42:47,340 --> 02:42:48,400
He doesn't wear a hat.

4066
02:42:48,620 --> 02:42:51,340
He only wears a bowler hat and you have preferences?

4067
02:42:52,780 --> 02:42:53,340
Yes.

4068
02:42:53,500 --> 02:42:54,040
Of course.

4069
02:42:54,360 --> 02:42:55,460
Right behind you, mom.

4070
02:42:58,440 --> 02:42:59,440
Oh no!

4071
02:43:00,600 --> 02:43:02,660
Your mistress is in good health.

4072
02:43:02,900 --> 02:43:03,900
Oh my god.

4073
02:43:03,960 --> 02:43:05,300
He whimpers.

4074
02:43:05,760 --> 02:43:07,500
You just live in Sanctuary Hills.

4075
02:43:07,620 --> 02:43:07,820
Yeah.

4076
02:43:09,460 --> 02:43:10,580
I'm sorry, bro.

4077
02:43:11,520 --> 02:43:14,180
If I accidentally shoot the robot, no one will complain.

4078
02:43:20,400 --> 02:43:22,520
It's for the sake of both of us.

4079
02:43:30,300 --> 02:43:30,740
Okay.

4080
02:43:30,740 --> 02:43:31,340
Let's see.

4081
02:43:31,400 --> 02:43:33,400
We need to find a chair to sit down.

4082
02:43:33,400 --> 02:43:34,260
Or...

4083
02:43:34,800 --> 02:43:36,340
Conwards taller too.

4084
02:43:36,960 --> 02:43:37,480
Alright.

4085
02:43:37,600 --> 02:43:38,060
Here we go.

4086
02:43:39,240 --> 02:43:39,940
Let's see.

4087
02:43:40,060 --> 02:43:40,820
We gotta wait.

4088
02:43:41,400 --> 02:43:42,820
Oh, it is real time.

4089
02:43:42,980 --> 02:43:43,300
Okay.

4090
02:43:43,340 --> 02:43:44,160
Five hours.

4091
02:43:46,800 --> 02:43:47,320
Alright.

4092
02:43:47,400 --> 02:43:47,840
I waited.

4093
02:43:48,080 --> 02:43:49,680
I sat on this chair and waited.

4094
02:43:49,760 --> 02:43:50,480
Are you there now?

4095
02:43:51,080 --> 02:43:52,840
Did you walk over here yet?

4096
02:43:53,080 --> 02:43:54,620
Are you just finding that out?

4097
02:43:54,780 --> 02:43:55,440
Where is he?

4098
02:43:55,500 --> 02:43:56,700
Oh, he finally made it.

4099
02:43:56,960 --> 02:43:58,020
Fucking finally.

4100
02:43:58,100 --> 02:43:59,060
Holy shit.

4101
02:43:59,440 --> 02:44:00,200
Excuse me.

4102
02:44:00,200 --> 02:44:00,360
Hey.

4103
02:44:01,040 --> 02:44:01,960
Good to see you again.

4104
02:44:02,320 --> 02:44:03,680
I was hoping you'd show up.

4105
02:44:03,800 --> 02:44:05,860
I should have listened to Mama Murphy all along.

4106
02:44:06,280 --> 02:44:07,880
Pretty nice place she's found for us.

4107
02:44:08,060 --> 02:44:09,720
I think we could settle down here.

4108
02:44:10,300 --> 02:44:11,480
Found for us?

4109
02:44:11,480 --> 02:44:12,460
This is my place!

4110
02:44:15,900 --> 02:44:16,340
Wait.

4111
02:44:16,340 --> 02:44:17,160
Give me a sec.

4112
02:44:17,320 --> 02:44:21,680
I'm gonna make sure... Apparently, we have to take back the fusion core so it doesn't get stolen.

4113
02:44:23,740 --> 02:44:24,760
Where's the fusion core?

4114
02:44:26,740 --> 02:44:28,700
Where the fuck did the fusion core go?

4115
02:44:29,560 --> 02:44:30,180
Where the fuck did the fusion core go?

4116
02:44:30,200 --> 02:44:31,160
I'm gonna steal.

4117
02:44:31,320 --> 02:44:31,820
No!

4118
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:33,580
I'm carrying too much!

4119
02:44:34,560 --> 02:44:35,080
No!

4120
02:44:37,480 --> 02:44:39,280
I already used it up.

4121
02:44:39,420 --> 02:44:40,520
Cogsworth, carry this!

4122
02:44:41,340 --> 02:44:43,720
Cogsworth, I need you to carry...

4123
02:44:43,720 --> 02:44:46,740
I need you to carry all my heavy shit.

4124
02:44:47,340 --> 02:44:48,320
Where is it?

4125
02:44:48,680 --> 02:44:49,760
Okay, where...

4126
02:44:50,660 --> 02:44:52,140
Oh, it was used up!

4127
02:44:52,300 --> 02:44:52,520
Oh!

4128
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:54,620
Okay, where's the, like...

4129
02:44:54,620 --> 02:44:55,200
Okay, wait.

4130
02:44:55,260 --> 02:44:56,880
I need him to carry all my useless stuff.

4131
02:44:57,180 --> 02:44:58,080
So, like...

4132
02:44:58,740 --> 02:45:01,840
I'm... I'm carrying way too much stuff right now.

4133
02:45:03,200 --> 02:45:04,240
Alright, let's see.

4134
02:45:05,700 --> 02:45:08,020
Where's the... Where did I put the...

4135
02:45:08,560 --> 02:45:10,280
Oh my god, there's so many things.

4136
02:45:12,560 --> 02:45:13,000
T45.

4137
02:45:13,780 --> 02:45:14,720
Sort by weight?

4138
02:45:14,800 --> 02:45:15,720
I can sort by weight?

4139
02:45:15,780 --> 02:45:16,060
Where?

4140
02:45:16,600 --> 02:45:17,340
Oh, Z!

4141
02:45:18,460 --> 02:45:18,900
Okay.

4142
02:45:18,900 --> 02:45:19,820
Sort by...

4143
02:45:19,820 --> 02:45:20,620
Is this by weight?

4144
02:45:20,960 --> 02:45:21,820
I can't tell.

4145
02:45:22,640 --> 02:45:23,520
Oh, here it is.

4146
02:45:23,680 --> 02:45:24,700
Yeah, take all of this.

4147
02:45:26,300 --> 02:45:27,180
Take all of that.

4148
02:45:28,160 --> 02:45:28,600
Nice.

4149
02:45:28,600 --> 02:45:29,300
Okay, then...

4150
02:45:30,200 --> 02:45:31,160
Is it by weight?

4151
02:45:31,240 --> 02:45:32,000
I can't tell.

4152
02:45:32,500 --> 02:45:33,600
By inventory.

4153
02:45:35,020 --> 02:45:36,000
Weight is three.

4154
02:45:36,660 --> 02:45:37,180
Oh!

4155
02:45:37,400 --> 02:45:38,540
Yep, there it is.

4156
02:45:38,700 --> 02:45:39,620
This has to be...

4157
02:45:39,960 --> 02:45:41,740
That has to be... Alright.

4158
02:45:41,920 --> 02:45:43,740
We got the minigun out of the way.

4159
02:45:44,540 --> 02:45:47,020
I don't know if I'm sorting by weight right now.

4160
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:49,860
Things that's sorted by damage?

4161
02:45:49,960 --> 02:45:50,820
I can't tell!

4162
02:45:51,140 --> 02:45:52,660
It doesn't tell me!

4163
02:45:55,040 --> 02:45:56,540
It doesn't tell me!

4164
02:46:00,200 --> 02:46:01,080
Which one?

4165
02:46:01,360 --> 02:46:02,800
Wait, now it's weight?

4166
02:46:03,420 --> 02:46:04,560
I can't tell!

4167
02:46:05,340 --> 02:46:06,540
Okay, 12.6...

4168
02:46:07,680 --> 02:46:08,120
10...

4169
02:46:09,760 --> 02:46:10,800
9... Oh, this is weight!

4170
02:46:10,840 --> 02:46:11,300
This is weight!

4171
02:46:11,420 --> 02:46:12,660
Okay, drifter's outfit.

4172
02:46:12,960 --> 02:46:14,080
You take this.

4173
02:46:14,620 --> 02:46:16,140
And then you take this.

4174
02:46:16,900 --> 02:46:18,180
And then... There you go.

4175
02:46:18,240 --> 02:46:19,000
That should be nice.

4176
02:46:19,220 --> 02:46:20,460
Thank you for carrying my stuff.

4177
02:46:21,480 --> 02:46:22,740
He's like my little...

4178
02:46:22,740 --> 02:46:23,760
He's like my caddy!

4179
02:46:25,820 --> 02:46:26,260
Hello.

4180
02:46:26,540 --> 02:46:28,720
Anyway, I am glad you're here.

4181
02:46:30,440 --> 02:46:32,180
Wait, did I fuck up the conversation?

4182
02:46:33,020 --> 02:46:34,460
But I've got another favor to ask.

4183
02:46:34,820 --> 02:46:37,240
I've had word from a settlement asking for help.

4184
02:46:37,880 --> 02:46:38,320
What?!

4185
02:46:38,320 --> 02:46:39,980
Still hoping there are Minutemen out there.

4186
02:46:40,960 --> 02:46:41,400
Somewhere.

4187
02:46:41,400 --> 02:46:46,680
The only chance to start rebuilding the Minutemen is to show people that they can count on us when they need us.

4188
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:49,780
Trouble is, I've got my hands full here.

4189
02:46:50,600 --> 02:46:52,500
Do you think you can go help out the settlement?

4190
02:46:52,680 --> 02:46:52,780
What?

4191
02:46:52,820 --> 02:46:53,240
Have to?

4192
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:56,440
Okay.

4193
02:46:56,540 --> 02:47:00,380
I was hoping for a chance to rescue some more helpless villagers.

4194
02:47:00,760 --> 02:47:02,000
It's not that people are helpless.

4195
02:47:02,580 --> 02:47:05,060
They just need someone to give them a helping hand sometimes.

4196
02:47:05,860 --> 02:47:07,700
That's what the Minutemen are supposed to be all about.

4197
02:47:07,700 --> 02:47:08,760
I don't wanna be a Minuteman.

4198
02:47:08,860 --> 02:47:10,100
You guys do it for free.

4199
02:47:11,200 --> 02:47:12,260
Talk to Sturgis.

4200
02:47:12,960 --> 02:47:15,400
I'm sure he'd be glad for all the help he can get.

4201
02:47:16,940 --> 02:47:17,380
Alright.

4202
02:47:17,740 --> 02:47:18,460
Hey there.

4203
02:47:18,660 --> 02:47:21,560
You ask me, freedom's always worth fighting for.

4204
02:47:21,940 --> 02:47:23,500
But what if I just wanna settle?

4205
02:47:23,900 --> 02:47:25,460
But what if I just wanna settle?

4206
02:47:27,280 --> 02:47:28,780
Do I have meds for you?

4207
02:47:29,060 --> 02:47:29,380
Do I have meds for you?

4208
02:47:29,780 --> 02:47:30,340
Do I have meds for you?

4209
02:47:30,680 --> 02:47:31,800
Do I have meds for you?

4210
02:47:31,800 --> 02:47:33,400
Do I have meds for you?

4211
02:47:33,400 --> 02:47:35,460
Do I have meds for you?

4212
02:47:35,880 --> 02:47:38,640
Yes, I was literally born here.

4213
02:47:38,780 --> 02:47:39,620
My energy?

4214
02:47:41,600 --> 02:47:42,580
What do you mean?

4215
02:47:42,880 --> 02:47:44,460
I told you before, kid.

4216
02:47:44,700 --> 02:47:47,120
I saw you leave that icebox.

4217
02:47:47,520 --> 02:47:49,380
I know your pain.

4218
02:47:49,960 --> 02:47:51,600
This world is...

4219
02:47:51,600 --> 02:47:52,860
Which faction's the best?

4220
02:47:53,160 --> 02:47:54,640
Okay, let me rephrase this.

4221
02:47:55,460 --> 02:47:56,800
This faction gives you the best stuff.

4222
02:47:57,960 --> 02:47:59,960
I don't care about more than that.

4223
02:48:02,660 --> 02:48:04,420
We don't need the good ending.

4224
02:48:05,040 --> 02:48:06,080
Wait, here you go.

4225
02:48:06,240 --> 02:48:07,300
Here, have some chems.

4226
02:48:11,820 --> 02:48:17,580
How much a companion- He likes me!

4227
02:48:25,460 --> 02:48:26,880
Because you're always with fear and suspicion.

4228
02:48:27,420 --> 02:48:28,880
But you'll find it.

4229
02:48:29,020 --> 02:48:33,040
You'll find that heart that's gonna lead you to your boy.

4230
02:48:33,860 --> 02:48:34,900
Oh, it's...

4231
02:48:35,640 --> 02:48:36,800
Oh no!

4232
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:41,500
If I refuse Preston too much, he'll refuse to travel with me.

4233
02:48:41,540 --> 02:48:42,500
Oh no!

4234
02:48:43,440 --> 02:48:45,280
That's what you need to do, kid.

4235
02:48:45,600 --> 02:48:46,660
Follow my heart?

4236
02:48:46,760 --> 02:48:49,620
I gave you chems and you told me to follow my heart?

4237
02:48:50,500 --> 02:48:51,080
Phew.

4238
02:48:51,440 --> 02:48:52,020
Wow.

4239
02:48:52,020 --> 02:48:52,240
Wow.

4240
02:48:53,100 --> 02:48:56,240
That took more out of me than usual.

4241
02:48:56,880 --> 02:48:59,600
I'm gonna need to rest now, kid.

4242
02:49:00,580 --> 02:49:02,500
What the fuck is that advice?

4243
02:49:03,260 --> 02:49:04,840
You want the best stuff?

4244
02:49:04,940 --> 02:49:06,060
You need ballistic armor.

4245
02:49:06,180 --> 02:49:07,640
Get that from the railroad.

4246
02:49:07,960 --> 02:49:09,380
Thank you for the super chat.

4247
02:49:09,520 --> 02:49:09,840
Thank you.

4248
02:49:09,900 --> 02:49:10,520
Thank you.

4249
02:49:13,020 --> 02:49:14,000
Where's Preston?

4250
02:49:15,560 --> 02:49:17,220
What kind of advice was that?

4251
02:49:17,280 --> 02:49:19,320
I could just watch a Disney movie for that shit.

4252
02:49:19,320 --> 02:49:22,580
Follow my fucking heart and I give you like 100...

4253
02:49:23,180 --> 02:49:26,220
Like 100 botocast worth of chems?

4254
02:49:26,460 --> 02:49:27,300
What do you need?

4255
02:49:33,900 --> 02:49:35,060
Aren't you used to it?

4256
02:49:36,420 --> 02:49:36,940
No.

4257
02:49:40,100 --> 02:49:40,620
Okay.

4258
02:49:43,180 --> 02:49:44,560
Okay, I changed my mind.

4259
02:49:45,660 --> 02:49:47,020
Yeah, I changed my mind.

4260
02:49:47,300 --> 02:49:48,640
Why can't you do it?

4261
02:49:49,320 --> 02:49:49,980
I can help to build beds.

4262
02:49:50,180 --> 02:49:52,040
Look, we got a lot on our plate.

4263
02:49:52,340 --> 02:49:53,960
And we've been on the run for weeks.

4264
02:49:54,380 --> 02:49:55,700
We need food, water, shelter...

4265
02:49:55,700 --> 02:49:57,120
The institute lets me teleport?

4266
02:49:58,120 --> 02:49:59,100
You asked how you could help.

4267
02:49:59,100 --> 02:50:00,420
Bro, I might as well join the institute.

4268
02:50:01,100 --> 02:50:01,940
Did you mean it or not?

4269
02:50:01,940 --> 02:50:02,720
Who needs walking?

4270
02:50:03,700 --> 02:50:04,320
Yeah, sure.

4271
02:50:04,440 --> 02:50:05,120
I'll give you guys bed.

4272
02:50:05,560 --> 02:50:05,560
Okay.

4273
02:50:05,900 --> 02:50:06,560
Good deal.

4274
02:50:06,740 --> 02:50:09,280
Just make sure we can sleep with a roof over our heads.

4275
02:50:09,780 --> 02:50:12,580
Some of these old houses still look solid enough to do the trick.

4276
02:50:12,860 --> 02:50:14,700
There's a workbench over there you can use.

4277
02:50:15,100 --> 02:50:16,480
Give me a holler if you need anything.

4278
02:50:18,440 --> 02:50:19,500
METI battle!

4279
02:50:19,620 --> 02:50:21,080
Better power armor?

4280
02:50:21,280 --> 02:50:24,660
And liberate prime with a brotherhood and free helicopter rides?

4281
02:50:25,280 --> 02:50:26,800
Yeah, but I can teleport.

4282
02:50:27,420 --> 02:50:29,260
Thank you for the superchat METI.

4283
02:50:29,360 --> 02:50:29,800
Thank you.

4284
02:50:33,040 --> 02:50:35,400
Move options with arrow keys.

4285
02:50:35,580 --> 02:50:37,260
Press to find the object you wish to build.

4286
02:50:37,380 --> 02:50:40,240
To build its first went, try adjusting your location.

4287
02:50:40,640 --> 02:50:40,920
Okay.

4288
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:43,620
I can build like...

4289
02:50:43,620 --> 02:50:45,720
I can build objects now.

4290
02:50:45,920 --> 02:50:46,400
Alright.

4291
02:50:46,480 --> 02:50:46,720
Alright.

4292
02:50:47,440 --> 02:50:48,900
I can build a chair.

4293
02:50:49,440 --> 02:50:50,740
They need a bed, right?

4294
02:50:52,040 --> 02:50:52,560
Okay.

4295
02:50:52,560 --> 02:50:55,800
Raider, cages, structures, furniture.

4296
02:50:56,320 --> 02:50:57,440
Alright, they need a bed.

4297
02:50:58,080 --> 02:50:58,920
Alright, here.

4298
02:50:59,100 --> 02:51:00,000
Have a fucking bed.

4299
02:51:03,720 --> 02:51:04,240
Uhh...

4300
02:51:07,990 --> 02:51:08,850
Is that enough?

4301
02:51:10,170 --> 02:51:11,910
20% happiness?

4302
02:51:12,170 --> 02:51:12,950
Why are you sad?

4303
02:51:13,450 --> 02:51:15,490
I gave you a fucking bed!

4304
02:51:22,530 --> 02:51:24,650
Wait, I can give him a sleeping bag?

4305
02:51:24,950 --> 02:51:27,470
Oh my god, you guys should have told me that earlier.

4306
02:51:27,650 --> 02:51:28,290
What the fu-

4307
02:51:31,390 --> 02:51:33,410
Why didn't you tell me that earlier?

4308
02:51:33,550 --> 02:51:34,750
That's so much better!

4309
02:51:35,490 --> 02:51:36,130
Okay, wait.

4310
02:51:37,110 --> 02:51:37,550
Uhh...

4311
02:51:38,570 --> 02:51:39,510
Where's the beds?

4312
02:51:39,670 --> 02:51:39,890
Okay.

4313
02:51:41,090 --> 02:51:42,190
Alright, there you go.

4314
02:51:42,370 --> 02:51:45,150
You sleep on- you get to sleep- oh wait, can I put this under?

4315
02:51:45,950 --> 02:51:46,950
There you go.

4316
02:51:47,010 --> 02:51:48,590
One lucky person.

4317
02:51:48,610 --> 02:51:50,530
One lucky person can sleep under this bed.

4318
02:51:51,210 --> 02:51:53,010
Alright, and then...

4319
02:51:53,430 --> 02:51:54,390
In the house?

4320
02:51:54,710 --> 02:51:55,570
It'll be fine!

4321
02:51:56,170 --> 02:51:56,850
Nature!

4322
02:51:57,070 --> 02:51:58,270
Look up in the sky!

4323
02:51:58,770 --> 02:51:59,230
You know?

4324
02:51:59,630 --> 02:52:04,750
You get to like- you get to like look up and see the wonderful stars.

4325
02:52:05,430 --> 02:52:06,950
The bunk bed.

4326
02:52:07,170 --> 02:52:07,850
Exactly!

4327
02:52:08,290 --> 02:52:09,530
It's bunk bed time.

4328
02:52:09,790 --> 02:52:10,330
Fine!

4329
02:52:10,870 --> 02:52:11,870
You sleep here.

4330
02:52:12,270 --> 02:52:13,530
Sleep next to the toilet.

4331
02:52:14,690 --> 02:52:15,370
Alright.

4332
02:52:16,310 --> 02:52:16,990
Nice.

4333
02:52:18,610 --> 02:52:20,230
Uhh... paintbrush removed?

4334
02:52:21,230 --> 02:52:22,930
Let's see...

4335
02:52:23,970 --> 02:52:26,690
Umm... and then... I don't know.

4336
02:52:26,830 --> 02:52:27,830
Sleep here.

4337
02:52:28,850 --> 02:52:29,790
Wait, I can put it here?

4338
02:52:30,710 --> 02:52:32,950
Somebody will figure out how to get in there.

4339
02:52:38,270 --> 02:52:43,370
And the lucky person gets to sleep on this bed.

4340
02:52:44,260 --> 02:52:46,390
Ooh, this is my bed right here.

4341
02:52:46,730 --> 02:52:47,350
Hahaha!

4342
02:52:47,350 --> 02:52:47,670
Hahaha!

4343
02:52:48,550 --> 02:52:49,150
Hahaha!

4344
02:52:49,930 --> 02:52:52,370
One lucky person, i.e.

4345
02:52:52,390 --> 02:52:54,690
me, gets to sleep on this bed.

4346
02:52:54,890 --> 02:52:55,630
Let's go!

4347
02:52:56,650 --> 02:52:57,990
That's where I'm gonna be sleeping.

4348
02:52:58,050 --> 02:53:00,270
And I'm next to the toilet and the showers!

4349
02:53:01,110 --> 02:53:01,430
Yay!

4350
02:53:02,910 --> 02:53:03,550
Hehehehehe!

4351
02:53:05,130 --> 02:53:05,770
Hehehehehe!

4352
02:53:06,590 --> 02:53:07,230
Wooo!

4353
02:53:08,890 --> 02:53:09,750
That's me!

4354
02:53:10,070 --> 02:53:11,070
My privilege!

4355
02:53:11,670 --> 02:53:12,250
Alright.

4356
02:53:12,450 --> 02:53:14,970
Well, to open the wall in the build area...

4357
02:53:14,970 --> 02:53:15,890
What?

4358
02:53:15,890 --> 02:53:18,450
Oh, I can like build other stuff here.

4359
02:53:18,930 --> 02:53:21,670
My dad loved the workshop part of this.

4360
02:53:21,730 --> 02:53:26,210
So then use food, water, a bed and shall increase yourself by providing each cellar with all the basics.

4361
02:53:26,450 --> 02:53:27,250
Do I have to?

4362
02:53:28,350 --> 02:53:29,610
What if I don't?

4363
02:53:30,510 --> 02:53:31,250
Stay sharp.

4364
02:53:31,610 --> 02:53:32,650
Don't let your guard down.

4365
02:53:32,970 --> 02:53:33,970
How do I assign people?

4366
02:53:34,350 --> 02:53:34,630
Hey there.

4367
02:53:34,870 --> 02:53:37,050
I knew Sturgis would find something to keep you busy.

4368
02:53:37,570 --> 02:53:39,290
Wait, I can assign people stuff?

4369
02:53:40,430 --> 02:53:40,830
How?

4370
02:53:41,950 --> 02:53:44,230
A cellar with all the basic necessities.

4371
02:53:44,230 --> 02:53:45,270
It says unassigned.

4372
02:53:46,110 --> 02:53:47,710
What the fuck is he gonna do?

4373
02:53:50,950 --> 02:53:58,610
Once the basic necessities are all increased, the overall happiness by raising the settlement's defense rating, this will reduce the chance that your settlement will be attacked.

4374
02:53:59,030 --> 02:54:00,130
My settlement's gonna be attacked?

4375
02:54:00,890 --> 02:54:01,990
Wait, cages?

4376
02:54:02,290 --> 02:54:02,970
For what?

4377
02:54:04,550 --> 02:54:05,110
Arenas?

4378
02:54:07,290 --> 02:54:09,030
What the fuck is this?

4379
02:54:12,330 --> 02:54:14,510
There's like arenas and everything?

4380
02:54:15,270 --> 02:54:15,550
Oh, there's crafting!

4381
02:54:18,130 --> 02:54:19,150
Oh my god!

4382
02:54:19,190 --> 02:54:19,990
They can make stuff?

4383
02:54:20,150 --> 02:54:20,610
Stores?

4384
02:54:21,270 --> 02:54:23,330
What are the stores gonna do for me?

4385
02:54:23,710 --> 02:54:26,930
Okay, resources, water, food.

4386
02:54:28,630 --> 02:54:30,610
Do I have to give them- Oh!

4387
02:54:30,730 --> 02:54:32,710
Like I can build this!

4388
02:54:33,390 --> 02:54:34,830
No, I don't have concrete.

4389
02:54:35,130 --> 02:54:35,910
Oh, never mind.

4390
02:54:36,070 --> 02:54:37,050
I can't build this.

4391
02:54:37,330 --> 02:54:38,730
Can I build food stuff?

4392
02:54:39,030 --> 02:54:39,930
No, I'm broke.

4393
02:54:41,110 --> 02:54:42,610
Okay... how about defense?

4394
02:54:43,470 --> 02:54:44,030
Power?

4395
02:54:45,270 --> 02:54:46,050
Oh, I have power!

4396
02:54:50,930 --> 02:54:51,750
What do I...

4397
02:54:52,310 --> 02:54:53,050
Power time.

4398
02:54:54,410 --> 02:54:55,530
I can build a generator.

4399
02:54:58,650 --> 02:55:00,910
I don't know what it's gonna do, but I can build it.

4400
02:55:01,230 --> 02:55:02,390
Oh, this builds five!

4401
02:55:03,170 --> 02:55:03,610
Alright.

4402
02:55:04,310 --> 02:55:05,570
I don't know what that does.

4403
02:55:06,190 --> 02:55:06,990
But it's there.

4404
02:55:07,970 --> 02:55:08,970
Scrap the town.

4405
02:55:09,170 --> 02:55:10,310
Okay, I'm gonna scrap my stuff.

4406
02:55:10,470 --> 02:55:11,070
How do I scrap?

4407
02:55:13,850 --> 02:55:15,830
How the fuck do I scrap?

4408
02:55:16,790 --> 02:55:17,230
Transfer?

4409
02:55:17,790 --> 02:55:19,490
Guys, how do I scrap my stuff?

4410
02:55:26,070 --> 02:55:27,390
How do I do that?

4411
02:55:27,450 --> 02:55:28,610
I have so much junk.

4412
02:55:29,490 --> 02:55:30,430
Like, look at this.

4413
02:55:34,410 --> 02:55:35,430
Transfer all junk.

4414
02:55:35,710 --> 02:55:37,450
Point at rubble and there's option to scrap.

4415
02:55:38,330 --> 02:55:39,390
Oververse, thank you for the super chat.

4416
02:55:39,470 --> 02:55:40,050
Thank you, thank you.

4417
02:55:40,070 --> 02:55:42,030
Plenty of follow-up for what's the over-under.

4418
02:55:42,110 --> 02:55:45,050
Allowing yourself to be constantly sidetracked by the Miniman.

4419
02:55:45,290 --> 02:55:46,210
Thank you for the super chat.

4420
02:55:46,290 --> 02:55:46,850
Thank you, thank you.

4421
02:55:46,890 --> 02:55:47,490
Oh, transfer.

4422
02:55:47,530 --> 02:55:48,330
Store all junk.

4423
02:55:48,410 --> 02:55:48,930
Oh, okay.

4424
02:55:50,410 --> 02:55:51,010
Transfer.

4425
02:55:51,010 --> 02:55:52,510
Store all junk?

4426
02:55:52,930 --> 02:55:53,490
Whoa.

4427
02:55:57,050 --> 02:55:58,490
That's a lot of junk.

4428
02:56:01,130 --> 02:56:02,590
Alright, what do I do after that?

4429
02:56:04,810 --> 02:56:06,010
Then press T?

4430
02:56:06,290 --> 02:56:07,030
I did it.

4431
02:56:07,770 --> 02:56:08,370
And then what?

4432
02:56:11,760 --> 02:56:12,720
Now scrap it?

4433
02:56:12,860 --> 02:56:13,240
Where?

4434
02:56:15,760 --> 02:56:17,200
Did I press V?

4435
02:56:18,840 --> 02:56:19,920
How do I scrap?

4436
02:56:21,620 --> 02:56:22,060
That's it?

4437
02:56:22,560 --> 02:56:23,440
And then you're good?

4438
02:56:23,540 --> 02:56:24,220
Do I have everything?

4439
02:56:25,160 --> 02:56:26,800
Oh, it does it automatically?

4440
02:56:27,200 --> 02:56:27,600
Oh!

4441
02:56:29,440 --> 02:56:30,240
Oh, okay.

4442
02:56:30,540 --> 02:56:33,360
I should be able to get resources now, right?

4443
02:56:35,580 --> 02:56:36,700
No, I'm still...

4444
02:56:36,700 --> 02:56:38,200
I still don't have steel.

4445
02:56:39,140 --> 02:56:40,580
Okay, I don't have carrots.

4446
02:56:41,760 --> 02:56:42,800
I can make...

4447
02:56:42,800 --> 02:56:46,300
Oh, I can make a scavenging station and a bell?

4448
02:56:46,680 --> 02:56:48,960
What the fuck am I gonna do with a bell?

4449
02:56:50,820 --> 02:56:52,760
Then look at the item to scrap?

4450
02:56:53,080 --> 02:56:55,020
How do I scrap my items?

4451
02:56:57,680 --> 02:56:58,640
Raider cages.

4452
02:57:00,480 --> 02:57:01,080
Uh...

4453
02:57:01,740 --> 02:57:03,880
Now scrap the town with R.

4454
02:57:04,100 --> 02:57:04,620
Oh, okay.

4455
02:57:05,200 --> 02:57:06,120
I'm gonna do it.

4456
02:57:06,880 --> 02:57:08,080
We don't need trees.

4457
02:57:08,460 --> 02:57:10,260
We don't need trees.

4458
02:57:11,360 --> 02:57:12,040
We don't need trees.

4459
02:57:12,040 --> 02:57:12,340
We don't need trees.

4460
02:57:13,280 --> 02:57:14,920
Alright, we'll scrap this house.

4461
02:57:15,320 --> 02:57:15,980
Alright, we'll scrap this house.

4462
02:57:17,040 --> 02:57:17,720
Let's see.

4463
02:57:18,240 --> 02:57:18,840
Concrete!

4464
02:57:19,140 --> 02:57:20,300
Oh my god!

4465
02:57:20,340 --> 02:57:20,800
Oh my god!

4466
02:57:22,720 --> 02:57:23,920
We don't need houses!

4467
02:57:25,260 --> 02:57:26,240
We don't need houses!

4468
02:57:26,440 --> 02:57:27,000
Whoa!

4469
02:57:28,340 --> 02:57:28,900
Alright.

4470
02:57:29,840 --> 02:57:30,960
And then...

4471
02:57:30,960 --> 02:57:33,100
I should be able to build resources now.

4472
02:57:33,620 --> 02:57:36,180
Alright, power, resources...

4473
02:57:36,180 --> 02:57:37,360
Does this require power?

4474
02:57:37,680 --> 02:57:38,440
It produces water.

4475
02:57:38,660 --> 02:57:39,940
Okay, you guys can have water now.

4476
02:57:40,100 --> 02:57:40,620
Congratulations!

4477
02:57:43,640 --> 02:57:44,760
And then...

4478
02:57:45,260 --> 02:57:46,160
They have water.

4479
02:57:46,420 --> 02:57:48,020
I guess I should give them food.

4480
02:57:49,620 --> 02:57:50,180
Resources...

4481
02:57:50,180 --> 02:57:50,960
Can I produce anything?

4482
02:57:51,700 --> 02:57:52,380
No?

4483
02:57:53,180 --> 02:57:54,400
Can't build anything.

4484
02:57:54,860 --> 02:57:54,900
Can't build anything.

4485
02:57:54,940 --> 02:57:55,200
Can't build anything.

4486
02:57:55,940 --> 02:57:57,240
Does this not require power?

4487
02:57:57,560 --> 02:57:58,560
What else requires power?

4488
02:57:59,260 --> 02:57:59,940
What else requires power?

4489
02:57:59,940 --> 02:58:08,960
Power, connector, power light, power miscellaneous, local gates, manufacturing, power, neon...

4490
02:58:08,960 --> 02:58:09,660
Oh my god!

4491
02:58:11,020 --> 02:58:13,000
But what if I have a neon sign?

4492
02:58:13,980 --> 02:58:14,160
But what if I have a neon sign?

4493
02:58:20,000 --> 02:58:20,680
Uh...

4494
02:58:20,680 --> 02:58:22,280
D for Doki.

4495
02:58:22,520 --> 02:58:22,740
D for Doki.

4496
02:58:24,520 --> 02:58:25,500
This is mine.

4497
02:58:25,720 --> 02:58:26,180
There you go!

4498
02:58:26,240 --> 02:58:26,580
I did it!

4499
02:58:27,400 --> 02:58:28,380
Does this work?

4500
02:58:30,060 --> 02:58:30,900
Is it on?

4501
02:58:39,240 --> 02:58:40,760
Why isn't it on?

4502
02:58:41,180 --> 02:58:42,320
D for Doki Town!

4503
02:58:42,800 --> 02:58:44,220
How do I connect it?

4504
02:58:44,300 --> 02:58:46,100
I have a generator right here!

4505
02:58:47,940 --> 02:58:48,760
Turn on!

4506
02:58:49,080 --> 02:58:49,640
Power!

4507
02:58:51,140 --> 02:58:52,720
Power of my fucking town!

4508
02:58:57,240 --> 02:59:00,000
I gotta connect the power?

4509
02:59:00,520 --> 02:59:02,680
I have to be an electrician?

4510
02:59:03,160 --> 02:59:05,120
Oh my god.

4511
02:59:05,780 --> 02:59:07,020
Bro, what?

4512
02:59:07,520 --> 02:59:10,920
How the fuck do I fucking place this?

4513
02:59:11,360 --> 02:59:12,300
Okay.

4514
02:59:13,320 --> 02:59:14,280
Um...

4515
02:59:14,280 --> 02:59:15,700
How?

4516
02:59:16,240 --> 02:59:20,080
I'm fu- A conduit?

4517
02:59:20,320 --> 02:59:23,440
What the fu- I don't understand.

4518
02:59:23,440 --> 02:59:24,240
Hahaha!

4519
02:59:28,320 --> 02:59:30,420
Do I just...

4520
02:59:30,420 --> 02:59:31,400
place this?

4521
02:59:32,260 --> 02:59:33,160
Is it connected?

4522
02:59:33,480 --> 02:59:34,360
I can't tell!

4523
02:59:37,120 --> 02:59:38,840
Okay here is a conduit.

4524
02:59:39,240 --> 02:59:40,040
Okay.

4525
02:59:40,380 --> 02:59:41,980
I got the conduit.

4526
02:59:42,480 --> 02:59:43,340
There we go.

4527
02:59:43,460 --> 02:59:44,080
Are you connected?

4528
02:59:45,920 --> 02:59:46,720
Hey!

4529
02:59:48,060 --> 02:59:49,700
Are you connected now?

4530
02:59:49,700 --> 02:59:49,880
Oh, wow.

4531
02:59:51,660 --> 02:59:52,780
Wire them?

4532
02:59:53,100 --> 02:59:54,420
How do I put a wire?

4533
02:59:57,220 --> 02:59:58,880
Go over to the generator.

4534
02:59:59,100 --> 02:59:59,240
Oh!

4535
03:00:01,580 --> 03:00:03,200
Oh my god, I'm doing it!

4536
03:00:07,440 --> 03:00:08,660
I'm doing it!

4537
03:00:10,780 --> 03:00:11,620
Get in!

4538
03:00:11,620 --> 03:00:11,720
Get in!

4539
03:00:16,820 --> 03:00:17,380
Okay.

4540
03:00:20,320 --> 03:00:21,280
Is it not...

4541
03:00:22,160 --> 03:00:23,440
Is it not...

4542
03:00:23,440 --> 03:00:24,300
connecting?

4543
03:00:24,720 --> 03:00:25,720
Why is it not connecting?

4544
03:00:27,320 --> 03:00:29,000
I need another conduit?

4545
03:00:29,400 --> 03:00:31,480
I need a... Oh my god.

4546
03:00:32,640 --> 03:00:33,760
Okay, conduit.

4547
03:00:33,880 --> 03:00:35,760
What kind of conduit do I need?

4548
03:00:37,260 --> 03:00:38,900
Put wire on the D?

4549
03:00:39,060 --> 03:00:41,020
I can put wire on the D?!

4550
03:00:41,620 --> 03:00:42,020
Of course I can.

4551
03:00:43,460 --> 03:00:45,760
Get the wire and put it on the D.

4552
03:00:46,780 --> 03:00:48,180
You guys lied to me.

4553
03:00:49,200 --> 03:00:50,580
You guys lied to me.

4554
03:00:51,040 --> 03:00:52,840
I can't attach it anywhere.

4555
03:00:53,260 --> 03:00:55,900
Build something that... Where can I attach this?

4556
03:00:56,900 --> 03:00:57,500
Be careful!

4557
03:00:57,620 --> 03:00:59,020
Don't get electrocuted!

4558
03:01:00,220 --> 03:01:02,340
What the fuck is this for?!

4559
03:01:04,860 --> 03:01:06,100
I can't believe it.

4560
03:01:06,140 --> 03:01:07,680
I couldn't put the wire on the D.

4561
03:01:08,220 --> 03:01:09,220
It's too far!

4562
03:01:09,380 --> 03:01:10,380
Do I need another one?

4563
03:01:11,620 --> 03:01:11,780
Wait.

4564
03:01:12,700 --> 03:01:15,700
Guys, we're slowly learning how to be an electrician.

4565
03:01:15,740 --> 03:01:17,940
We're just... It's just very slow.

4566
03:01:18,380 --> 03:01:18,900
No!

4567
03:01:19,060 --> 03:01:20,000
I don't have...

4568
03:01:22,520 --> 03:01:23,460
Okay.

4569
03:01:24,120 --> 03:01:26,460
We don't have enough copper!

4570
03:01:27,880 --> 03:01:28,720
I give up.

4571
03:01:28,860 --> 03:01:29,900
This town doesn't...

4572
03:01:29,900 --> 03:01:30,560
I give up.

4573
03:01:30,600 --> 03:01:31,380
Fuck this town.

4574
03:01:32,080 --> 03:01:34,600
I give up.

4575
03:01:40,160 --> 03:01:42,800
This town doesn't need it.

4576
03:01:42,800 --> 03:01:44,040
Who fucking cares?

4577
03:01:46,590 --> 03:01:48,840
Guys, I fucking... I give up, man.

4578
03:01:49,020 --> 03:01:50,560
I fucking give up.

4579
03:01:51,100 --> 03:01:52,720
This is too difficult.

4580
03:01:54,120 --> 03:01:55,440
No way.

4581
03:01:56,440 --> 03:01:59,440
This is way too difficult to understand.

4582
03:02:01,620 --> 03:02:03,960
I'll figure this out another time.

4583
03:02:04,140 --> 03:02:06,180
My brain isn't working today.

4584
03:02:06,560 --> 03:02:07,620
Or tomorrow.

4585
03:02:08,500 --> 03:02:09,160
Wait.

4586
03:02:09,180 --> 03:02:10,800
Why can't I open my...

4587
03:02:11,880 --> 03:02:12,780
Why can't I open my...

4588
03:02:12,800 --> 03:02:13,840
Pit boy?

4589
03:02:14,980 --> 03:02:16,020
Where's my pit boy?

4590
03:02:17,800 --> 03:02:20,100
I have one intelligence, guys.

4591
03:02:20,180 --> 03:02:20,980
You all know that.

4592
03:02:21,300 --> 03:02:23,060
Why can't I open my pit boy?

4593
03:02:24,200 --> 03:02:25,640
Is it because, like, it...

4594
03:02:25,640 --> 03:02:27,480
needs me to finish this tutorial?

4595
03:02:29,460 --> 03:02:31,000
I am pressing tab!

4596
03:02:31,280 --> 03:02:31,560
I am pressing tab!

4597
03:02:32,780 --> 03:02:34,480
It won't let me...

4598
03:02:34,480 --> 03:02:36,200
It won't let me put my...

4599
03:02:36,200 --> 03:02:36,540
It won't let me put my...

4600
03:02:36,540 --> 03:02:37,760
Open my pit boy anymore!

4601
03:02:38,760 --> 03:02:40,080
I'm pressing tab!

4602
03:02:41,360 --> 03:02:42,780
Is it because I...

4603
03:02:42,800 --> 03:02:44,540
Is it because I refuse?

4604
03:02:45,720 --> 03:02:46,960
Oh shit, no.

4605
03:02:47,960 --> 03:02:48,860
Oh shit.

4606
03:02:48,980 --> 03:02:50,480
That's not the right one.

4607
03:02:53,420 --> 03:02:54,760
Oh, there you go.

4608
03:02:55,080 --> 03:02:55,720
It's I.

4609
03:02:56,000 --> 03:02:56,340
Okay.

4610
03:02:56,500 --> 03:02:58,020
I wanted to level up.

4611
03:02:58,400 --> 03:02:59,100
Alright, guys.

4612
03:02:59,160 --> 03:03:00,280
What do I actually get?

4613
03:03:01,860 --> 03:03:02,820
Apparently, I...

4614
03:03:02,820 --> 03:03:05,560
Apparently, I chose the wrong perk, guys.

4615
03:03:05,780 --> 03:03:07,720
So what should I actually do?

4616
03:03:11,000 --> 03:03:12,780
Guys, apparently I chose the wrong perk.

4617
03:03:12,800 --> 03:03:14,760
So what perk should I really do?

4618
03:03:15,760 --> 03:03:16,360
Intelligence?

4619
03:03:16,480 --> 03:03:16,860
Why?

4620
03:03:25,560 --> 03:03:27,340
Check one's understrength?

4621
03:03:27,480 --> 03:03:29,840
I don't want to do, like, iron fist, though.

4622
03:03:30,160 --> 03:03:30,860
Let's see.

4623
03:03:30,960 --> 03:03:33,140
Swing do 40% more damage.

4624
03:03:34,620 --> 03:03:36,300
Intelligence for faster XP?

4625
03:03:37,840 --> 03:03:39,520
Do I really?

4626
03:03:40,660 --> 03:03:42,960
The smarter the better.

4627
03:03:43,460 --> 03:03:44,640
The smarter the better.

4628
03:03:45,940 --> 03:03:46,840
Alright, fine.

4629
03:03:47,020 --> 03:03:49,020
I'll be like...

4630
03:03:49,020 --> 03:03:51,480
I read a book, so I'm a little bit smarter now.

4631
03:03:52,340 --> 03:03:52,900
Fine.

4632
03:03:52,960 --> 03:03:54,100
I read a book, guys.

4633
03:03:54,140 --> 03:03:55,040
Are you happy now?

4634
03:03:55,580 --> 03:03:56,640
I did it.

4635
03:03:57,460 --> 03:03:58,780
I read a book.

4636
03:04:02,710 --> 03:04:03,270
Alright.

4637
03:04:05,530 --> 03:04:06,490
Idiot savant?

4638
03:04:06,590 --> 03:04:07,610
Wait, idiot savant?

4639
03:04:07,890 --> 03:04:08,490
What's that?

4640
03:04:10,790 --> 03:04:11,830
Idiot savant?

4641
03:04:12,530 --> 03:04:13,130
Idiot savant?

4642
03:04:13,130 --> 03:04:14,470
Where is idiot savant?

4643
03:04:16,870 --> 03:04:17,910
Where is that?

4644
03:04:18,290 --> 03:04:19,170
Where is that?

4645
03:04:19,170 --> 03:04:20,370
Life giver?

4646
03:04:21,110 --> 03:04:21,710
Awareness?

4647
03:04:24,050 --> 03:04:25,390
Luck for more loot?

4648
03:04:26,510 --> 03:04:28,670
Oh, I don't have enough luck for idiot savant?

4649
03:04:28,910 --> 03:04:29,710
Where is that?

4650
03:04:29,970 --> 03:04:30,910
I have to scroll down?

4651
03:04:31,170 --> 03:04:32,210
It won't let me scroll down.

4652
03:04:32,890 --> 03:04:33,490
Oh!

4653
03:04:34,290 --> 03:04:34,890
Oh!

4654
03:04:34,890 --> 03:04:35,490
What?

4655
03:04:35,490 --> 03:04:35,850
What?

4656
03:04:39,080 --> 03:04:39,640
Woah!

4657
03:04:41,340 --> 03:04:44,120
That's a lot of stuff I did not see.

4658
03:04:47,280 --> 03:04:48,800
I was like, woah!

4659
03:04:48,980 --> 03:04:50,140
That's all I have.

4660
03:04:51,440 --> 03:04:52,940
That's all I have.

4661
03:04:53,080 --> 03:04:53,440
Wow!

4662
03:04:54,960 --> 03:04:56,340
Naira, thank you for the Akka...

4663
03:04:56,740 --> 03:04:57,300
Holy shit!

4664
03:04:57,360 --> 03:04:59,400
Thank you for the Akka, Akka, Akka, Akka Super!

4665
03:05:00,000 --> 03:05:00,380
Thank you!

4666
03:05:01,040 --> 03:05:02,900
Money for Tokis and electricity?

4667
03:05:03,220 --> 03:05:07,960
But I instinctively tried to add savant to that title somehow and it stays a lot above my priorities.

4668
03:05:08,200 --> 03:05:09,400
I'm not sorry.

4669
03:05:09,540 --> 03:05:10,440
Go Doki!

4670
03:05:10,440 --> 03:05:10,820
Go!

4671
03:05:11,240 --> 03:05:11,760
Santiago!

4672
03:05:11,940 --> 03:05:13,140
Thank you for the Akka!

4673
03:05:13,140 --> 03:05:13,500
Super!

4674
03:05:13,780 --> 03:05:14,220
Thank you!

4675
03:05:14,220 --> 03:05:14,880
Thank you!

4676
03:05:15,280 --> 03:05:17,300
This place looks like my childhood city.

4677
03:05:17,360 --> 03:05:18,040
So nostalgic.

4678
03:05:18,460 --> 03:05:19,280
Thank you for the Akka!

4679
03:05:19,300 --> 03:05:19,640
Super!

4680
03:05:19,740 --> 03:05:20,020
Thank you!

4681
03:05:20,060 --> 03:05:20,680
Thank you!

4682
03:05:20,940 --> 03:05:22,560
I can't believe there's...

4683
03:05:22,560 --> 03:05:24,400
There's so much more!

4684
03:05:24,860 --> 03:05:26,500
Oh my god!

4685
03:05:29,400 --> 03:05:30,440
Holy shit!

4686
03:05:31,360 --> 03:05:32,040
It's okay.

4687
03:05:32,100 --> 03:05:32,960
I'm getting better now.

4688
03:05:33,240 --> 03:05:34,280
Alright, let's...

4689
03:05:35,040 --> 03:05:36,100
We gotta go this way?

4690
03:05:36,440 --> 03:05:37,820
Oh man, I ran out of stamina!

4691
03:05:38,680 --> 03:05:40,540
I can't believe I can run out of stamina.

4692
03:05:42,220 --> 03:05:43,540
I forgot where to go.

4693
03:05:45,380 --> 03:05:45,820
Uh...

4694
03:05:46,560 --> 03:05:47,720
There's so many places.

4695
03:05:48,000 --> 03:05:48,720
Okay, let's see.

4696
03:05:48,860 --> 03:05:50,020
There is... I'm here.

4697
03:05:51,740 --> 03:05:52,620
Uh... Concord...

4698
03:05:52,620 --> 03:05:53,960
Where's the settlement, technically?

4699
03:05:54,280 --> 03:05:55,220
Talk to the settlers?

4700
03:05:55,400 --> 03:05:56,980
I don't care about the settlers!

4701
03:05:57,620 --> 03:05:59,020
Let's just go a different direction.

4702
03:05:59,040 --> 03:06:01,540
Let's go this way and see if we can find a quest.

4703
03:06:03,180 --> 03:06:04,520
Why am I tired already?

4704
03:06:07,380 --> 03:06:08,260
Oh no...

4705
03:06:08,260 --> 03:06:11,140
Guys, I should have fucking worked on my legs, guys.

4706
03:06:11,660 --> 03:06:12,760
Luck is good to have?

4707
03:06:12,960 --> 03:06:14,200
Okay, we'll level up luck later.

4708
03:06:15,960 --> 03:06:17,720
We'll keep our intelligence too.

4709
03:06:19,440 --> 03:06:20,120
Let's go here.

4710
03:06:21,600 --> 03:06:22,560
There's houses here!

4711
03:06:23,980 --> 03:06:25,880
Oh no, I'm going back to Concord.

4712
03:06:25,980 --> 03:06:26,240
Whoops!

4713
03:06:29,140 --> 03:06:32,180
I wanna go a different direction from Concord!

4714
03:06:32,560 --> 03:06:34,660
There has to be a random quest somewhere!

4715
03:06:34,820 --> 03:06:35,020
I'm gonna go this way.

4716
03:06:35,840 --> 03:06:36,360
Okay.

4717
03:06:37,600 --> 03:06:39,020
How do I not...

4718
03:06:39,760 --> 03:06:40,480
Toggle run?

4719
03:06:41,320 --> 03:06:42,780
Yeah, but I can only sprint.

4720
03:06:43,840 --> 03:06:45,160
Get out of combat mode?

4721
03:06:45,300 --> 03:06:46,680
I can get out of combat mode?

4722
03:06:47,160 --> 03:06:49,020
How do I get out of combat mode?

4723
03:06:51,320 --> 03:06:52,360
Holy shit!

4724
03:06:53,260 --> 03:06:54,440
Toggle walk off?

4725
03:06:55,260 --> 03:06:56,180
Where is that?

4726
03:06:57,880 --> 03:06:58,400
Uh...

4727
03:06:58,400 --> 03:06:59,540
Oh, it's Caps Lock?

4728
03:06:59,820 --> 03:07:00,340
Oh!

4729
03:07:01,300 --> 03:07:03,580
I didn't realize I had Caps Lock on.

4730
03:07:03,760 --> 03:07:04,280
Oh!

4731
03:07:04,280 --> 03:07:04,280
I didn't realize I had Caps Lock on.

4732
03:07:06,380 --> 03:07:07,320
Oh, there we go!

4733
03:07:09,360 --> 03:07:10,100
Hold R.

4734
03:07:10,620 --> 03:07:12,460
Oh, I can run faster now!

4735
03:07:12,840 --> 03:07:13,420
Oh, I can run faster now!

4736
03:07:13,420 --> 03:07:14,400
I'm learning so much, guys.

4737
03:07:14,540 --> 03:07:16,840
Okay, we're gonna go past this area.

4738
03:07:17,100 --> 03:07:18,380
There has to be like...

4739
03:07:18,940 --> 03:07:20,620
a secret quest somewhere.

4740
03:07:20,740 --> 03:07:22,500
Not a secret quest, but there has to be something.

4741
03:07:23,540 --> 03:07:24,100
What's that?

4742
03:07:24,280 --> 03:07:24,880
Why is that red?

4743
03:07:25,500 --> 03:07:26,820
Is that... Oh, that's a car.

4744
03:07:27,860 --> 03:07:28,300
Alright.

4745
03:07:29,120 --> 03:07:30,980
There has to be somebody here!

4746
03:07:31,300 --> 03:07:32,060
There has to be somebody here!

4747
03:07:33,980 --> 03:07:34,420
No!

4748
03:07:35,480 --> 03:07:37,440
We gotta touch the radiated grass.

4749
03:07:37,600 --> 03:07:39,760
We gotta go outside and touch some grass, Cogsworth.

4750
03:07:40,660 --> 03:07:44,020
You haven't been outside of the home for years now.

4751
03:07:45,260 --> 03:07:46,380
Gorsky Cabin?

4752
03:07:46,400 --> 03:07:47,220
Does someone live here?

4753
03:07:47,560 --> 03:07:48,120
Hello?

4754
03:07:49,340 --> 03:07:50,080
Knock knock!

4755
03:07:50,360 --> 03:07:50,720
Oh!

4756
03:07:51,840 --> 03:07:52,400
Cogsworth!

4757
03:07:52,640 --> 03:07:52,980
Help!

4758
03:07:57,220 --> 03:07:58,160
Alright, nice.

4759
03:07:58,740 --> 03:07:59,580
Be bait!

4760
03:07:59,720 --> 03:08:00,120
Be bait!

4761
03:08:00,720 --> 03:08:01,580
Good bait!

4762
03:08:01,780 --> 03:08:02,160
Good bait!

4763
03:08:04,460 --> 03:08:05,340
Oh shit!

4764
03:08:05,360 --> 03:08:05,880
It's okay!

4765
03:08:06,080 --> 03:08:06,820
You're a robot!

4766
03:08:06,940 --> 03:08:09,640
People won't try to cancel me if I accidentally shoot you!

4767
03:08:09,740 --> 03:08:10,320
Oh shit!

4768
03:08:10,320 --> 03:08:10,320
It's okay!

4769
03:08:10,320 --> 03:08:10,320
You're a robot!

4770
03:08:10,320 --> 03:08:10,320
People won't try to cancel me if I accidentally shoot you!

4771
03:08:10,440 --> 03:08:10,780
There you go!

4772
03:08:11,960 --> 03:08:12,840
Oh, I have to reload.

4773
03:08:13,240 --> 03:08:14,460
Oh my god, he's so strong!

4774
03:08:16,480 --> 03:08:17,980
Oh my god, he's so strong!

4775
03:08:18,460 --> 03:08:18,880
Oh my god, he's so strong!

4776
03:08:18,880 --> 03:08:19,440
Woah, my hero!

4777
03:08:20,380 --> 03:08:20,900
Fuck!

4778
03:08:21,160 --> 03:08:23,380
I accidentally used a step!

4779
03:08:23,940 --> 03:08:27,420
I accidentally used a step!

4780
03:08:27,420 --> 03:08:27,540
Okay.

4781
03:08:27,900 --> 03:08:27,980
Okay.

4782
03:08:28,060 --> 03:08:30,240
Sorry, that was very feral.

4783
03:08:30,420 --> 03:08:31,720
The fuck!

4784
03:08:32,280 --> 03:08:32,940
The fuck!

4785
03:08:32,940 --> 03:08:35,200
The fuck!

4786
03:08:36,200 --> 03:08:36,720
Sorry.

4787
03:08:36,720 --> 03:08:39,060
I hate... I was very...

4788
03:08:39,960 --> 03:08:43,240
Alright, here we go.

4789
03:08:43,360 --> 03:08:43,580
Alright, here we go.

4790
03:08:43,580 --> 03:08:44,780
Let's open this door.

4791
03:08:45,060 --> 03:08:45,660
Hello?

4792
03:08:45,940 --> 03:08:46,880
Are you dead?

4793
03:08:48,800 --> 03:08:49,220
Hello?

4794
03:08:49,840 --> 03:08:49,840
Are you dead?

4795
03:08:49,840 --> 03:08:50,440
Boop!

4796
03:08:51,240 --> 03:08:52,300
That should work.

4797
03:08:52,520 --> 03:08:53,660
You should die, right?

4798
03:08:54,480 --> 03:08:55,540
How did I...

4799
03:08:55,540 --> 03:08:57,820
What the fuck!

4800
03:08:57,980 --> 03:08:58,560
Okay!

4801
03:08:58,940 --> 03:09:01,460
I might as well shoot it myself!

4802
03:09:02,020 --> 03:09:02,460
Okay!

4803
03:09:04,720 --> 03:09:06,340
I might as well shoot it myself!

4804
03:09:06,340 --> 03:09:06,340
Okay!

4805
03:09:06,340 --> 03:09:06,700
I might as well shoot it myself!

4806
03:09:06,700 --> 03:09:08,900
Better aim if I shot my...

4807
03:09:08,900 --> 03:09:12,260
If I shot with my own fucking raw aim.

4808
03:09:14,080 --> 03:09:15,160
Oh shit!

4809
03:09:15,460 --> 03:09:15,960
Let's...

4810
03:09:16,580 --> 03:09:17,320
Can I craft?

4811
03:09:18,420 --> 03:09:19,860
No, nothing I really want to craft.

4812
03:09:21,980 --> 03:09:23,040
How did I miss?

4813
03:09:23,040 --> 03:09:23,820
Exactly how?

4814
03:09:24,440 --> 03:09:25,440
How did I miss?

4815
03:09:27,800 --> 03:09:29,820
I should have just shot myself!

4816
03:09:31,440 --> 03:09:32,300
Oh, nice.

4817
03:09:32,400 --> 03:09:33,300
More junk for me.

4818
03:09:34,820 --> 03:09:38,260
More junk for me to scrap and never build on in my settlement.

4819
03:09:38,640 --> 03:09:40,420
More junk for me to scrap and never build on in my settlement.

4820
03:09:40,420 --> 03:09:41,120
More junk for me to scrap and never build on in my settlement.

4821
03:09:41,140 --> 03:09:41,600
Okay.

4822
03:09:41,820 --> 03:09:42,980
Got to the cabin.

4823
03:09:43,260 --> 03:09:44,220
There's like nothing here.

4824
03:09:45,720 --> 03:09:47,140
It just works.

4825
03:09:47,320 --> 03:09:48,300
It just works.

4826
03:09:49,620 --> 03:09:50,820
Where are the people?

4827
03:09:51,300 --> 03:09:52,520
Give me quests!

4828
03:09:53,040 --> 03:09:54,380
So I can get money!

4829
03:09:55,340 --> 03:09:57,860
God, I'm looking my fucking broad shoulders.

4830
03:09:58,480 --> 03:10:00,140
God, I'm looking my fucking broad shoulders.

4831
03:10:01,700 --> 03:10:03,000
That's all I want!

4832
03:10:04,100 --> 03:10:05,160
There's a basement?

4833
03:10:05,600 --> 03:10:06,920
There's people in there?

4834
03:10:07,720 --> 03:10:10,000
You thought you could hide from me, you quuss!

4835
03:10:10,440 --> 03:10:11,860
You thought you could hide from me, you quuss!

4836
03:10:15,120 --> 03:10:17,140
Guys, gamers don't look down!

4837
03:10:17,380 --> 03:10:19,480
How the fuck was I supposed to know?

4838
03:10:20,000 --> 03:10:21,540
That there was a basement?

4839
03:10:21,860 --> 03:10:21,900
That there was a basement?

4840
03:10:23,200 --> 03:10:24,480
Alright, here we go.

4841
03:10:24,580 --> 03:10:25,180
I'm coming over.

4842
03:10:28,020 --> 03:10:28,860
Coming over.

4843
03:10:31,160 --> 03:10:32,040
Oh my god!

4844
03:10:32,060 --> 03:10:32,700
There it is!

4845
03:10:35,040 --> 03:10:36,900
Oh no, it's a loading screen!

4846
03:10:37,460 --> 03:10:39,420
My biggest enemy!

4847
03:10:39,760 --> 03:10:40,760
Loading screen!

4848
03:10:43,920 --> 03:10:44,560
Hello?

4849
03:10:44,740 --> 03:10:45,440
Who's in here?

4850
03:10:47,040 --> 03:10:48,060
There's a weapon?

4851
03:10:50,160 --> 03:10:50,940
Let's see.

4852
03:10:51,060 --> 03:10:52,260
Can I improve my...

4853
03:10:52,260 --> 03:10:53,240
No, I can't.

4854
03:10:53,260 --> 03:10:54,260
There's nothing I want to improve.

4855
03:10:54,540 --> 03:10:56,100
I can rename it!

4856
03:10:56,380 --> 03:10:57,500
I'll rename it!

4857
03:10:58,580 --> 03:10:59,940
Wait, how do I...

4858
03:10:59,940 --> 03:11:00,820
Can I...

4859
03:11:01,620 --> 03:11:02,020
Rename.

4860
03:11:02,580 --> 03:11:02,980
Oh!

4861
03:11:03,600 --> 03:11:04,000
Okay.

4862
03:11:05,360 --> 03:11:06,640
Okay, wait, that's not it.

4863
03:11:07,180 --> 03:11:07,940
Where's my gun?

4864
03:11:08,040 --> 03:11:09,060
I accidentally named it T.

4865
03:11:14,940 --> 03:11:15,860
There you go.

4866
03:11:16,240 --> 03:11:16,860
There you go.

4867
03:11:16,900 --> 03:11:17,540
Oh shit, wait.

4868
03:11:19,240 --> 03:11:20,040
Dragoon Buster.

4869
03:11:20,140 --> 03:11:20,900
There you go.

4870
03:11:23,400 --> 03:11:24,540
Uh, exit, yeah.

4871
03:11:25,920 --> 03:11:26,320
T.

4872
03:11:26,660 --> 03:11:27,740
I can't.

4873
03:11:27,740 --> 03:11:27,820
I can't.

4874
03:11:28,680 --> 03:11:28,940
I can't.

4875
03:11:31,380 --> 03:11:31,780
Alright.

4876
03:11:32,540 --> 03:11:33,780
Named it after you guys.

4877
03:11:35,300 --> 03:11:37,080
I don't even know if it's a good gun or not.

4878
03:11:39,820 --> 03:11:40,380
Oh, I can't.

4879
03:11:40,460 --> 03:11:41,520
Oh no, there's nothing in here.

4880
03:11:41,720 --> 03:11:42,040
Hello?

4881
03:11:42,080 --> 03:11:42,780
Anybody in here?

4882
03:11:43,400 --> 03:11:43,800
Hello?

4883
03:11:46,220 --> 03:11:47,920
Do you guys have quests to give me?

4884
03:11:48,100 --> 03:11:49,180
Whoa, why is that blue?

4885
03:11:50,900 --> 03:11:51,300
Hello?

4886
03:11:54,340 --> 03:11:55,120
Oh shit!

4887
03:11:55,200 --> 03:11:55,700
Oh shit!

4888
03:11:55,700 --> 03:11:56,380
Don't worry...

4889
03:11:57,680 --> 03:11:59,280
Wayne Gorck's Key...

4890
03:11:59,280 --> 03:12:00,540
Who the fuck are you?

4891
03:12:01,900 --> 03:12:04,120
Who the fuck is Wayne Gorck's Key?

4892
03:12:04,300 --> 03:12:05,180
Are you important?

4893
03:12:06,160 --> 03:12:07,660
Oh, you got fucking...

4894
03:12:07,660 --> 03:12:08,320
bottle caps?

4895
03:12:10,200 --> 03:12:11,580
I hope he wasn't...

4896
03:12:11,580 --> 03:12:12,340
important, guys.

4897
03:12:17,080 --> 03:12:21,760
Guys, I hope I didn't...

4898
03:12:21,760 --> 03:12:23,160
kill anybody important.

4899
03:12:24,400 --> 03:12:25,680
It's surrounding.

4900
03:12:25,700 --> 03:12:26,880
He's dead now, so...

4901
03:12:30,300 --> 03:12:30,960
Let's see.

4902
03:12:32,120 --> 03:12:33,780
Wayne's Wasteland Survival Guide.

4903
03:12:33,840 --> 03:12:35,960
You collected an issue of the Wasteland Survival Guide.

4904
03:12:36,080 --> 03:12:37,880
Diamond City is now permanently marked on your...

4905
03:12:37,880 --> 03:12:38,300
Oh, hey!

4906
03:12:38,380 --> 03:12:39,680
I got to go to Diamond City now.

4907
03:12:40,600 --> 03:12:41,080
Nice.

4908
03:12:42,880 --> 03:12:44,420
Oh, there's radiation down here.

4909
03:12:44,460 --> 03:12:45,060
That'll be fine.

4910
03:12:45,180 --> 03:12:45,920
Password required?

4911
03:12:46,300 --> 03:12:47,360
Oh no.

4912
03:12:47,580 --> 03:12:47,900
Okay.

4913
03:12:51,620 --> 03:12:52,100
Rest.

4914
03:12:54,780 --> 03:12:55,260
Zero.

4915
03:12:55,760 --> 03:12:56,200
Uh...

4916
03:12:56,760 --> 03:12:57,200
Rose.

4917
03:12:58,080 --> 03:12:58,520
One.

4918
03:12:59,180 --> 03:13:00,840
Okay, it's obviously not R.

4919
03:13:01,160 --> 03:13:04,260
So it has to be either O, S, or E.

4920
03:13:05,220 --> 03:13:06,680
O, S, E.

4921
03:13:06,920 --> 03:13:07,300
O.

4922
03:13:07,460 --> 03:13:08,540
Okay, how about four?

4923
03:13:09,600 --> 03:13:10,360
Oh, it's O!

4924
03:13:10,700 --> 03:13:11,360
It's O.

4925
03:13:12,240 --> 03:13:13,240
Okay, it's O.

4926
03:13:13,760 --> 03:13:14,200
Core.

4927
03:13:14,440 --> 03:13:15,580
It has to be Core?

4928
03:13:16,120 --> 03:13:16,700
Wait, no.

4929
03:13:16,760 --> 03:13:17,340
It can't be Core.

4930
03:13:17,420 --> 03:13:18,220
It could be Foul.

4931
03:13:20,340 --> 03:13:20,780
Or...

4932
03:13:20,780 --> 03:13:21,920
Uh... It's Foul!

4933
03:13:23,240 --> 03:13:24,160
I got locked out.

4934
03:13:24,160 --> 03:13:24,940
It's not Foul, guys.

4935
03:13:25,700 --> 03:13:26,260
It's okay.

4936
03:13:26,640 --> 03:13:28,120
It's just plus four, guys.

4937
03:13:28,160 --> 03:13:28,540
It's okay.

4938
03:13:28,980 --> 03:13:30,860
I ate like four bananas, guys.

4939
03:13:30,960 --> 03:13:31,380
It's okay.

4940
03:13:31,640 --> 03:13:32,480
It'll be fine.

4941
03:13:32,600 --> 03:13:34,040
It's just four bananas, guys.

4942
03:13:34,100 --> 03:13:34,600
It's just...

4943
03:13:34,600 --> 03:13:36,800
Oh, now it's five... six bananas.

4944
03:13:36,980 --> 03:13:38,020
Oh, nine bananas!

4945
03:13:38,240 --> 03:13:38,580
It's okay.

4946
03:13:38,780 --> 03:13:39,180
Hahaha!

4947
03:13:39,860 --> 03:13:40,320
Hahaha!

4948
03:13:40,880 --> 03:13:43,300
Now there's nine bananas inside me.

4949
03:13:43,520 --> 03:13:43,960
Pray!

4950
03:13:44,200 --> 03:13:45,200
Okay, now... gone!

4951
03:13:45,440 --> 03:13:45,740
Okay.

4952
03:13:46,340 --> 03:13:47,520
It's G-O-N-E.

4953
03:13:47,720 --> 03:13:48,600
Okay, maybe more?

4954
03:13:48,900 --> 03:13:49,380
Two!

4955
03:13:49,640 --> 03:13:50,060
Okay.

4956
03:13:50,880 --> 03:13:54,660
It has to be... It has to have M... O... or R.

4957
03:13:54,660 --> 03:13:56,520
O or R.

4958
03:13:56,980 --> 03:13:57,980
O or R.

4959
03:13:57,980 --> 03:13:58,100
O or R.

4960
03:13:58,100 --> 03:13:59,640
It has to have M, O or R.

4961
03:14:00,560 --> 03:14:01,040
Uh...

4962
03:14:02,580 --> 03:14:03,480
O and E?

4963
03:14:03,680 --> 03:14:05,860
No, it can't be E, because gone was zero.

4964
03:14:07,020 --> 03:14:08,180
It can't be E.

4965
03:14:08,280 --> 03:14:09,780
It has to M, O or R.

4966
03:14:11,720 --> 03:14:12,680
Let's see...

4967
03:14:17,740 --> 03:14:18,700
Vote... higher...

4968
03:14:18,700 --> 03:14:20,560
Hope... Pray was zero.

4969
03:14:20,560 --> 03:14:21,060
Yeah, exactly.

4970
03:14:21,980 --> 03:14:24,100
So... it has to... Uh...

4971
03:14:25,200 --> 03:14:26,860
Uh... Oh, gone was one?

4972
03:14:27,240 --> 03:14:27,640
Oh!

4973
03:14:28,780 --> 03:14:30,860
So it should be like O and E.

4974
03:14:31,060 --> 03:14:31,440
Oh!

4975
03:14:32,180 --> 03:14:32,660
No!

4976
03:14:32,800 --> 03:14:34,660
Then it should be... If it's one...

4977
03:14:34,660 --> 03:14:37,240
Then it should be... It can't be E.

4978
03:14:37,460 --> 03:14:41,960
It can't be E then.

4979
03:14:42,360 --> 03:14:42,840
Fork!

4980
03:14:42,860 --> 03:14:43,540
There's a fork?

4981
03:14:44,800 --> 03:14:45,400
Where's fork?

4982
03:14:46,420 --> 03:14:47,380
I got locked out.

4983
03:14:47,520 --> 03:14:48,240
You guys fucked with me.

4984
03:14:48,940 --> 03:14:49,840
Guys, it's okay.

4985
03:14:50,460 --> 03:14:51,180
It's okay.

4986
03:14:51,360 --> 03:14:52,560
I have Radaway.

4987
03:14:52,940 --> 03:14:54,400
Guys, I have Radaway.

4988
03:14:54,660 --> 03:14:55,840
We can do it again.

4989
03:14:56,000 --> 03:14:57,340
Guys, I have Radaway.

4990
03:14:57,400 --> 03:14:58,100
Guys, it's okay.

4991
03:14:58,480 --> 03:15:01,520
It might not look really good right now, but I have Radaway.

4992
03:15:04,280 --> 03:15:04,720
Alright.

4993
03:15:05,800 --> 03:15:06,680
Made... zero.

4994
03:15:06,960 --> 03:15:08,080
How about...

4995
03:15:09,600 --> 03:15:12,140
Okay, it's not any of that, so it's not M.

4996
03:15:12,440 --> 03:15:13,520
How about life?

4997
03:15:13,900 --> 03:15:14,660
It's zero.

4998
03:15:14,780 --> 03:15:15,920
Okay, this is bad.

4999
03:15:16,140 --> 03:15:16,820
How about poor?

5000
03:15:17,040 --> 03:15:18,360
Okay, it's also zero.

5001
03:15:18,760 --> 03:15:20,220
Okay, let me reset it.

5002
03:15:21,540 --> 03:15:22,820
I figured it out.

5003
03:15:23,140 --> 03:15:23,580
Alright.

5004
03:15:23,580 --> 03:15:24,660
Very...

5005
03:15:24,660 --> 03:15:25,000
Alright.

5006
03:15:25,120 --> 03:15:25,480
Title!

5007
03:15:25,780 --> 03:15:26,140
Okay.

5008
03:15:26,420 --> 03:15:26,960
Gold!

5009
03:15:27,360 --> 03:15:28,540
Okay, I'm gonna reset it.

5010
03:15:32,940 --> 03:15:33,480
Cape!

5011
03:15:35,720 --> 03:15:36,800
Likeness is one.

5012
03:15:36,960 --> 03:15:39,360
So is our CAP gain?

5013
03:15:40,020 --> 03:15:40,980
Okay, it's A.

5014
03:15:41,240 --> 03:15:42,400
Then it has to be A then.

5015
03:15:45,860 --> 03:15:46,400
Warm?

5016
03:15:47,540 --> 03:15:48,900
It's A, obviously.

5017
03:15:51,980 --> 03:15:52,520
Lake?

5018
03:15:54,740 --> 03:15:55,900
It's a lake?

5019
03:15:58,300 --> 03:15:59,560
What the fuck is it?

5020
03:15:59,800 --> 03:16:02,140
Why am I so bad at this?

5021
03:16:05,340 --> 03:16:06,620
Why is it so...

5022
03:16:06,620 --> 03:16:07,660
Me Smash!

5023
03:16:13,480 --> 03:16:14,200
Okay.

5024
03:16:14,760 --> 03:16:15,480
No!

5025
03:16:16,260 --> 03:16:16,620
Guys,

5026
03:16:20,440 --> 03:16:23,800
I keep accidentally using my stim pack.

5027
03:16:26,520 --> 03:16:27,780
Okay, here we go.

5028
03:16:27,820 --> 03:16:28,300
This is it.

5029
03:16:28,440 --> 03:16:28,860
Draw!

5030
03:16:29,440 --> 03:16:30,200
Likeness 1.

5031
03:16:30,500 --> 03:16:31,040
Is it dark?

5032
03:16:31,200 --> 03:16:31,460
0.

5033
03:16:31,640 --> 03:16:32,280
So it's not D.

5034
03:16:32,700 --> 03:16:33,600
It's not D.

5035
03:16:34,320 --> 03:16:36,380
So it's either R, A, or W.

5036
03:16:37,060 --> 03:16:38,460
R, A, or W.

5037
03:16:38,680 --> 03:16:40,100
Okay, R, A, or W.

5038
03:16:40,160 --> 03:16:42,040
Where the fuck is R, A, or W?

5039
03:16:42,640 --> 03:16:44,540
R, R, A, or...

5040
03:16:44,540 --> 03:16:44,900
Fear!

5041
03:16:46,480 --> 03:16:46,900
Fear!

5042
03:16:48,980 --> 03:16:49,860
Okay, it's A.

5043
03:16:51,200 --> 03:16:52,100
Alright, it's A.

5044
03:16:55,520 --> 03:16:56,700
It's... It's the A.

5045
03:16:56,920 --> 03:16:57,980
It has to be the A.

5046
03:16:58,140 --> 03:16:59,080
Where else would it be?

5047
03:16:59,640 --> 03:17:01,700
But like, what else can it be though?

5048
03:17:05,200 --> 03:17:05,640
What?

5049
03:17:05,640 --> 03:17:06,320
It's a way?

5050
03:17:06,900 --> 03:17:07,600
Where's the way?

5051
03:17:09,240 --> 03:17:10,320
It's not a way.

5052
03:17:12,180 --> 03:17:13,580
It's not a way, guys.

5053
03:17:13,780 --> 03:17:15,760
Guys, we have to crack this!

5054
03:17:19,740 --> 03:17:20,180
Guys!

5055
03:17:21,440 --> 03:17:22,080
What is this?

5056
03:17:22,100 --> 03:17:22,800
What can it be?

5057
03:17:24,440 --> 03:17:25,080
Yard.

5058
03:17:25,080 --> 03:17:25,720
0.

5059
03:17:26,540 --> 03:17:27,180
Wave.

5060
03:17:27,600 --> 03:17:27,960
0.

5061
03:17:28,020 --> 03:17:29,580
Alright, we give... Okay, reset.

5062
03:17:30,040 --> 03:17:31,100
Alright, from!

5063
03:17:31,700 --> 03:17:32,340
Raw!

5064
03:17:33,160 --> 03:17:33,800
Fear!

5065
03:17:33,840 --> 03:17:34,580
Are you serious?

5066
03:17:34,660 --> 03:17:35,580
None of them?

5067
03:17:37,080 --> 03:17:38,280
Okay, door!

5068
03:17:38,860 --> 03:17:39,500
Warm!

5069
03:17:39,920 --> 03:17:40,560
Help!

5070
03:17:40,880 --> 03:17:42,240
I swear to God.

5071
03:17:42,420 --> 03:17:44,420
I have to... There's no... Evil!

5072
03:17:45,340 --> 03:17:45,900
Fear!

5073
03:17:46,040 --> 03:17:46,280
Oh!

5074
03:17:46,480 --> 03:17:46,960
Oh!

5075
03:17:46,960 --> 03:17:47,420
Oh!

5076
03:17:47,420 --> 03:17:47,780
2!

5077
03:17:47,960 --> 03:17:48,320
2!

5078
03:17:48,320 --> 03:17:48,520
2!

5079
03:17:48,600 --> 03:17:49,340
Okay, we got it.

5080
03:17:49,740 --> 03:17:50,380
2!

5081
03:17:56,320 --> 03:17:57,520
Okay, 2!

5082
03:17:58,000 --> 03:18:02,820
Okay, it has to be... Okay, is there another one that has double E's?

5083
03:18:03,220 --> 03:18:04,500
Is there another one?

5084
03:18:05,980 --> 03:18:06,500
Seek!

5085
03:18:06,680 --> 03:18:07,320
We're seek!

5086
03:18:07,660 --> 03:18:08,540
Where is it?

5087
03:18:08,760 --> 03:18:09,660
How do you seek?

5088
03:18:10,000 --> 03:18:10,520
Yes!

5089
03:18:11,180 --> 03:18:11,980
We did it.

5090
03:18:12,040 --> 03:18:13,020
I fucking knew it.

5091
03:18:13,040 --> 03:18:14,780
This will be my first and only entry.

5092
03:18:14,940 --> 03:18:16,920
I identify myself...

5093
03:18:18,220 --> 03:18:18,740
Um...

5094
03:18:20,420 --> 03:18:23,020
But... I can't believe I did all that for lore.

5095
03:18:23,220 --> 03:18:26,880
I identify myself as a free-thinking individual of these once great United States.

5096
03:18:27,120 --> 03:18:32,100
I will not stand idly by as the government infects the minds of its people with devices like the electrical tower.

5097
03:18:32,380 --> 03:18:34,120
They've erected in my front lawn.

5098
03:18:34,360 --> 03:18:41,500
I pledge to take down this mind-controlled device by any means necessary and also begun construction on a device.

5099
03:18:41,680 --> 03:18:45,360
If you are reading this, I have certainly been killed or detained in the government interrogation camp.

5100
03:18:45,360 --> 03:18:48,860
The news will surely wrap the truth and ban me as a traitor.

5101
03:18:49,120 --> 03:18:50,400
Do not believe their lies.

5102
03:18:50,720 --> 03:18:56,180
Let all true patriots know that what I do, I do it for my own free will and for the good of my country.

5103
03:18:56,580 --> 03:18:57,280
That's it?

5104
03:18:57,440 --> 03:18:58,280
That was it.

5105
03:18:58,380 --> 03:18:59,780
I lost half my HP.

5106
03:19:00,040 --> 03:19:00,860
That was it.

5107
03:19:01,120 --> 03:19:01,480
I...

5108
03:19:02,620 --> 03:19:06,060
Fuck you, Gray... whatever, Wayne Grotsky.

5109
03:19:06,200 --> 03:19:06,980
Fuck you.

5110
03:19:10,000 --> 03:19:11,440
I did all that.

5111
03:19:11,920 --> 03:19:13,460
Okay, where is my Radaway?

5112
03:19:13,860 --> 03:19:14,980
Where is...

5113
03:19:15,360 --> 03:19:16,740
The fucking 5Gs.

5114
03:19:20,060 --> 03:19:21,840
Is it a help?

5115
03:19:21,980 --> 03:19:23,020
Is it helping?

5116
03:19:23,140 --> 03:19:24,200
I can't tell.

5117
03:19:24,600 --> 03:19:25,980
I can't tell.

5118
03:19:27,160 --> 03:19:30,060
Did it help?

5119
03:19:30,400 --> 03:19:31,900
Oh my god, it's going down!

5120
03:19:38,210 --> 03:19:39,330
Rad X.

5121
03:19:39,650 --> 03:19:40,970
Rad Resist.

5122
03:19:40,970 --> 03:19:42,530
Oh, it resists Rad.

5123
03:19:42,770 --> 03:19:43,130
Okay.

5124
03:19:43,490 --> 03:19:44,730
Rad Resist.

5125
03:19:44,770 --> 03:19:46,650
Oh, that just resists.

5126
03:19:46,810 --> 03:19:49,550
I should have been taking Rad X this entire time.

5127
03:19:53,210 --> 03:19:54,550
Bob, thank you for the super chat.

5128
03:19:54,610 --> 03:19:55,370
Thank you, thank you.

5129
03:19:58,550 --> 03:20:01,130
You see lines closed with brackets like...

5130
03:20:01,130 --> 03:20:03,590
Clicking them will remove a wrong answer.

5131
03:20:03,710 --> 03:20:04,590
Couldn't be a life sa...

5132
03:20:04,590 --> 03:20:05,750
Oh my god, I could have...

5133
03:20:05,750 --> 03:20:07,050
Guys, what the fuck?

5134
03:20:07,070 --> 03:20:08,170
Where was my back seat earlier?

5135
03:20:09,870 --> 03:20:11,790
Thank you for the super chat, Bob.

5136
03:20:12,190 --> 03:20:13,290
Thank you, thank you.

5137
03:20:13,890 --> 03:20:14,910
I'm slowly learning.

5138
03:20:15,070 --> 03:20:17,090
Guys, I'm just roleplaying as 2Intellect.

5139
03:20:17,170 --> 03:20:17,510
Guys.

5140
03:20:17,510 --> 03:20:18,930
I know what I'm doing.

5141
03:20:19,070 --> 03:20:20,530
I just want to be more immersive.

5142
03:20:26,090 --> 03:20:28,450
I'm just trying to be more immersive chat.

5143
03:20:30,490 --> 03:20:31,830
Zonnerman, thank you for the super chat.

5144
03:20:31,910 --> 03:20:32,570
Thank you, thank you.

5145
03:20:32,570 --> 03:20:35,290
Fake Canadian, doesn't even know the name it's referencing.

5146
03:20:35,550 --> 03:20:36,430
Thank you for the super chat.

5147
03:20:36,530 --> 03:20:37,170
Thank you, thank you.

5148
03:20:37,390 --> 03:20:39,590
I don't... I don't... I'm sorry.

5149
03:20:39,730 --> 03:20:40,550
I don't watch hockey.

5150
03:20:42,750 --> 03:20:47,790
I am... I am the one of the two Canadians that don't watch hockey.

5151
03:20:47,950 --> 03:20:51,570
The only hockey team I know is the Canucks.

5152
03:20:52,370 --> 03:20:54,130
That's the only hockey.

5153
03:20:54,690 --> 03:20:57,490
And then what happened after like... what was it?

5154
03:20:57,570 --> 03:20:58,730
After the Stanley Cup.

5155
03:21:00,990 --> 03:21:02,190
Alright, where am I?

5156
03:21:04,130 --> 03:21:05,830
Okay, I cleared it.

5157
03:21:05,930 --> 03:21:07,390
Wait, I want to head to Diamond City.

5158
03:21:07,670 --> 03:21:09,050
Can I just run to Diamond City?

5159
03:21:09,550 --> 03:21:10,530
Okay, talk to Diamond City.

5160
03:21:10,550 --> 03:21:11,210
I'm going to the cellars.

5161
03:21:11,230 --> 03:21:12,890
Where the fuck is Diamond City?

5162
03:21:17,180 --> 03:21:18,100
Where is it?

5163
03:21:19,920 --> 03:21:22,180
I thought they marked Diamond City for me.

5164
03:21:26,020 --> 03:21:27,960
I thought they marked... Oh, there it is!

5165
03:21:28,640 --> 03:21:29,360
Place marker.

5166
03:21:29,540 --> 03:21:29,980
It's time.

5167
03:21:30,520 --> 03:21:31,880
We're going straight to Diamond City.

5168
03:21:32,560 --> 03:21:33,420
Where's the marker?

5169
03:21:33,580 --> 03:21:34,100
Is it this way?

5170
03:21:36,140 --> 03:21:36,980
Alright, it's time.

5171
03:21:38,020 --> 03:21:38,700
It's time.

5172
03:21:38,880 --> 03:21:40,540
Our journey is to Diamond City.

5173
03:21:40,640 --> 03:21:41,000
Let's go.

5174
03:21:47,240 --> 03:21:47,980
Let's go.

5175
03:21:48,340 --> 03:21:49,740
It's speed run time.

5176
03:21:49,940 --> 03:21:52,200
We just go straight to Diamond City.

5177
03:21:53,920 --> 03:21:54,520
Whoa!

5178
03:21:56,600 --> 03:21:58,820
To Diamond City we go!

5179
03:21:59,420 --> 03:21:59,620
Oh!

5180
03:21:59,820 --> 03:22:00,320
Ow!

5181
03:22:01,900 --> 03:22:02,920
I don't understand.

5182
03:22:03,180 --> 03:22:04,000
Why are they shooting me?

5183
03:22:05,820 --> 03:22:07,100
Wait, I'm poisoned?

5184
03:22:08,540 --> 03:22:11,640
I ain't giving you poison-chilling chempushers anything.

5185
03:22:12,000 --> 03:22:12,740
Who's that?

5186
03:22:12,740 --> 03:22:14,200
I'm going to give you a gun to my boy.

5187
03:22:14,360 --> 03:22:16,360
He bought them fair and square, Trudy.

5188
03:22:16,840 --> 03:22:17,320
Hello?

5189
03:22:17,900 --> 03:22:19,340
What's going on over here?

5190
03:22:19,400 --> 03:22:20,460
I'm heading to Diamond City.

5191
03:22:20,880 --> 03:22:22,420
Shoot up that little trading post of yours.

5192
03:22:22,600 --> 03:22:22,900
Hello?

5193
03:22:23,340 --> 03:22:23,380
Whoa!

5194
03:22:23,620 --> 03:22:25,000
Easy there, scammer.

5195
03:22:25,180 --> 03:22:26,040
You want to talk?

5196
03:22:26,240 --> 03:22:26,940
He doesn't involve you.

5197
03:22:28,980 --> 03:22:30,120
Lower your gun.

5198
03:22:30,620 --> 03:22:31,440
I have two charisma.

5199
03:22:31,800 --> 03:22:31,820
Can you stop waving your gun in my face?

5200
03:22:32,140 --> 03:22:33,700
Or it's going to involve me.

5201
03:22:33,860 --> 03:22:34,460
That's it.

5202
03:22:34,660 --> 03:22:35,220
You're dead.

5203
03:22:35,220 --> 03:22:35,340
What?

5204
03:22:36,180 --> 03:22:36,660
Bro!

5205
03:22:37,160 --> 03:22:37,640
What?

5206
03:22:38,580 --> 03:22:39,400
I'm done!

5207
03:22:40,340 --> 03:22:40,900
I'm done!

5208
03:22:40,900 --> 03:22:41,220
I'm done!

5209
03:22:48,510 --> 03:22:49,070
I'm done!

5210
03:22:49,070 --> 03:22:50,630
Guys, did I have to do this again?

5211
03:22:50,870 --> 03:22:51,650
No, I don't.

5212
03:22:51,650 --> 03:22:52,230
No, thank God.

5213
03:22:52,330 --> 03:22:52,650
Okay.

5214
03:22:53,910 --> 03:22:55,950
To Diamond City we go.

5215
03:23:02,230 --> 03:23:04,090
What happened to me?

5216
03:23:04,730 --> 03:23:05,810
Holy shit!

5217
03:23:06,030 --> 03:23:07,550
Not so fast.

5218
03:23:08,450 --> 03:23:09,550
I'm going to fucking heal.

5219
03:23:09,750 --> 03:23:10,970
Oh my God.

5220
03:23:13,510 --> 03:23:15,950
What the fuck happened?

5221
03:23:16,270 --> 03:23:17,870
Who killed him?

5222
03:23:17,890 --> 03:23:19,190
I'm shooting them first.

5223
03:23:21,830 --> 03:23:24,050
I can't believe it.

5224
03:23:24,070 --> 03:23:26,430
My two charisma failed me.

5225
03:23:27,670 --> 03:23:30,090
I fucking learned my lesson.

5226
03:23:31,410 --> 03:23:32,690
Where are they?

5227
03:23:32,830 --> 03:23:34,730
They can't just shoot me.

5228
03:23:39,510 --> 03:23:40,230
What?

5229
03:23:40,230 --> 03:23:42,310
How did he survive that?

5230
03:23:43,910 --> 03:23:44,430
I'm going to kill him.

5231
03:23:44,510 --> 03:23:46,250
I'm going to kill him.

5232
03:23:46,250 --> 03:23:46,550
I'm going to kill him.

5233
03:23:46,550 --> 03:23:47,430
Holy shit!

5234
03:23:47,730 --> 03:23:49,890
Oh, he doesn't die by a headshot.

5235
03:23:50,070 --> 03:23:51,930
He doesn't die from a headshot.

5236
03:23:52,410 --> 03:23:53,170
It's okay.

5237
03:23:53,670 --> 03:23:54,510
It's okay.

5238
03:23:56,950 --> 03:23:57,710
It's okay.

5239
03:23:57,970 --> 03:23:58,490
Boom.

5240
03:23:58,730 --> 03:23:59,470
There we go.

5241
03:24:00,390 --> 03:24:02,050
Okay, this gun fucking sucks.

5242
03:24:02,110 --> 03:24:03,450
I'm fucking swapping guns.

5243
03:24:07,510 --> 03:24:08,830
Is this better?

5244
03:24:10,770 --> 03:24:11,830
Oh, never mind.

5245
03:24:11,930 --> 03:24:12,790
Cogsworth did everything.

5246
03:24:14,270 --> 03:24:14,710
Nice.

5247
03:24:14,750 --> 03:24:15,290
I did it.

5248
03:24:16,670 --> 03:24:18,850
Wait, he has an insane gun.

5249
03:24:18,930 --> 03:24:19,830
I'm taking that gun.

5250
03:24:20,070 --> 03:24:20,970
What was that gun?

5251
03:24:22,910 --> 03:24:25,210
What was that gun that I just took?

5252
03:24:25,450 --> 03:24:26,250
Was it the action?

5253
03:24:26,430 --> 03:24:27,070
Okay, revolve.

5254
03:24:28,170 --> 03:24:29,050
Damage 24.

5255
03:24:29,910 --> 03:24:30,730
Oh my God.

5256
03:24:30,770 --> 03:24:32,050
I could have looked at the damage.

5257
03:24:33,070 --> 03:24:33,950
Damage 45.

5258
03:24:35,250 --> 03:24:36,130
Oh, 28.

5259
03:24:36,950 --> 03:24:37,770
That's insane.

5260
03:24:38,530 --> 03:24:39,310
Dragoon Buster.

5261
03:24:39,350 --> 03:24:40,170
Wait, Dragoon Buster.

5262
03:24:40,250 --> 03:24:41,190
Okay, I'm going to...

5263
03:24:41,190 --> 03:24:42,230
This one's easier.

5264
03:24:42,370 --> 03:24:43,070
It has more ammo.

5265
03:24:43,350 --> 03:24:44,150
Sorry, guys.

5266
03:24:45,510 --> 03:24:46,550
Hey, guys.

5267
03:24:49,930 --> 03:24:50,710
Whoops, sorry.

5268
03:24:53,210 --> 03:24:53,890
I'm sorry.

5269
03:24:59,270 --> 03:25:01,010
I literally saved your life.

5270
03:25:04,130 --> 03:25:04,650
Fighter.

5271
03:25:06,110 --> 03:25:07,290
I have a few minutes to browse.

5272
03:25:07,290 --> 03:25:08,450
A little bit of everything.

5273
03:25:09,890 --> 03:25:10,750
Oh, wait.

5274
03:25:11,130 --> 03:25:12,090
Is this to buy?

5275
03:25:12,610 --> 03:25:13,690
No, I don't need your shit.

5276
03:25:14,470 --> 03:25:15,670
I saved your life.

5277
03:25:17,050 --> 03:25:17,870
You're going to buy?

5278
03:25:19,310 --> 03:25:20,910
You got things covered from here?

5279
03:25:21,070 --> 03:25:21,270
Yeah.

5280
03:25:21,390 --> 03:25:21,870
Are you okay?

5281
03:25:22,190 --> 03:25:25,130
It's going to take my son a while to get off the chems, but we'll make it.

5282
03:25:26,090 --> 03:25:27,730
Varson, thank you for the super chat.

5283
03:25:27,830 --> 03:25:28,050
Thank you.

5284
03:25:29,150 --> 03:25:30,270
Ultimate power boot.

5285
03:25:30,370 --> 03:25:32,470
Show up, say stop, then die.

5286
03:25:33,050 --> 03:25:33,950
Just browsing for now.

5287
03:25:35,690 --> 03:25:36,690
Did she pay me?

5288
03:25:36,770 --> 03:25:37,270
Oh, she did.

5289
03:25:37,270 --> 03:25:38,290
I didn't notice.

5290
03:25:38,730 --> 03:25:39,590
I swear.

5291
03:25:40,210 --> 03:25:42,670
Wait, if I kill her, can I just steal everything?

5292
03:25:54,650 --> 03:25:55,710
I'm just saying.

5293
03:25:57,690 --> 03:25:58,690
Not worth.

5294
03:26:01,350 --> 03:26:01,910
Fine.

5295
03:26:02,310 --> 03:26:04,130
Okay, not buying it.

5296
03:26:04,230 --> 03:26:05,550
I've got a few minutes to browse.

5297
03:26:05,770 --> 03:26:06,730
I lose the store forever?

5298
03:26:07,190 --> 03:26:09,010
But what would I buy from the store?

5299
03:26:09,370 --> 03:26:10,770
What would I need from them?

5300
03:26:11,390 --> 03:26:14,030
Like, ooh, General Chao's Revenge.

5301
03:26:14,070 --> 03:26:14,630
What?

5302
03:26:14,750 --> 03:26:16,530
Does 50% more damage?

5303
03:26:16,530 --> 03:26:19,130
Holy shit, he has so much stuff.

5304
03:26:20,430 --> 03:26:21,810
What do I sell?

5305
03:26:22,230 --> 03:26:23,730
I don't know what's, like, worthless.

5306
03:26:24,150 --> 03:26:24,850
I can't tell.

5307
03:26:24,950 --> 03:26:27,090
Everything seems, like, super useful to me.

5308
03:26:27,630 --> 03:26:30,390
You can sell your... just sell your stuff.

5309
03:26:30,470 --> 03:26:31,350
But what would I sell?

5310
03:26:32,110 --> 03:26:34,530
Everything seems like something I want to keep.

5311
03:26:34,730 --> 03:26:36,350
I guess I don't need two gas masks.

5312
03:26:36,730 --> 03:26:38,410
I don't need two gas masks.

5313
03:26:40,010 --> 03:26:41,950
Um... what else do I not need?

5314
03:26:42,670 --> 03:26:44,130
Gas masks with goggles.

5315
03:26:44,930 --> 03:26:47,510
Uh, I guess I don't need two of these.

5316
03:26:47,750 --> 03:26:49,490
I'll just take, like, one of them.

5317
03:26:51,090 --> 03:26:52,550
And then sell the...

5318
03:26:52,550 --> 03:26:52,950
Oh yeah!

5319
03:26:53,050 --> 03:26:53,770
The wedding ring!

5320
03:26:53,890 --> 03:26:57,870
I should sell my wedding ring to let people know I'm not married anymore.

5321
03:26:59,810 --> 03:27:00,690
How much is it?

5322
03:27:00,850 --> 03:27:03,090
16 bottle caps?!

5323
03:27:03,910 --> 03:27:07,090
My husband cheaped out on the wedding ring!

5324
03:27:07,990 --> 03:27:10,630
It's not even made of real diamond!

5325
03:27:11,770 --> 03:27:12,310
Hahaha!

5326
03:27:14,130 --> 03:27:14,430
Hahaha!

5327
03:27:16,010 --> 03:27:18,530
I can't believe it!

5328
03:27:18,950 --> 03:27:21,490
He cheaped out on our love!

5329
03:27:21,870 --> 03:27:23,470
That's fucked up.

5330
03:27:23,670 --> 03:27:24,930
That's so fucked up.

5331
03:27:25,410 --> 03:27:27,250
He doesn't love... he doesn't...

5332
03:27:27,250 --> 03:27:28,310
He never loved me!

5333
03:27:28,510 --> 03:27:29,050
Hahaha!

5334
03:27:30,930 --> 03:27:31,370
Hahaha!

5335
03:27:32,630 --> 03:27:34,510
Oh shit, 78.

5336
03:27:35,070 --> 03:27:36,590
Not even a hundred!

5337
03:27:37,050 --> 03:27:37,670
Hahaha!

5338
03:27:38,630 --> 03:27:41,690
It's not even a hundred!

5339
03:27:41,950 --> 03:27:42,550
Hahaha!

5340
03:27:44,130 --> 03:27:44,530
Hahaha!

5341
03:27:46,830 --> 03:27:48,150
Um... toy car?

5342
03:27:48,830 --> 03:27:50,090
Wait, where's the toy car?

5343
03:27:50,230 --> 03:27:50,450
T.

5344
03:27:50,710 --> 03:27:51,250
Hahaha!

5345
03:27:52,790 --> 03:27:53,430
Um...

5346
03:27:53,430 --> 03:27:55,750
But what if I need the toy car later?

5347
03:27:56,250 --> 03:27:57,730
What if I need this?

5348
03:27:58,770 --> 03:28:00,530
Alright, I'll just click accept.

5349
03:28:00,970 --> 03:28:01,850
Confirm trade.

5350
03:28:02,230 --> 03:28:03,190
I'll take that.

5351
03:28:03,450 --> 03:28:04,370
Alright, let's go.

5352
03:28:05,710 --> 03:28:07,570
I can't believe I can't...

5353
03:28:07,870 --> 03:28:09,790
I did all that for nothing.

5354
03:28:11,910 --> 03:28:12,230
Okay.

5355
03:28:14,330 --> 03:28:17,890
I'm sorry Cogsworth for stealing that one item.

5356
03:28:18,270 --> 03:28:19,910
I didn't know what I was doing.

5357
03:28:20,150 --> 03:28:20,770
I'm sorry.

5358
03:28:21,470 --> 03:28:22,470
Okay, let's go.

5359
03:28:22,750 --> 03:28:24,090
Let's go Cogsworth!

5360
03:28:24,870 --> 03:28:26,450
We're gonna go to Diamond City!

5361
03:28:27,450 --> 03:28:30,110
We're not ending stream until we get to Diamond City!

5362
03:28:30,430 --> 03:28:31,430
Oh, I got Careflower!

5363
03:28:32,130 --> 03:28:33,870
Diamond City, here we come!

5364
03:28:34,510 --> 03:28:35,010
Hahaha!

5365
03:28:37,070 --> 03:28:37,650
Yay!

5366
03:28:38,710 --> 03:28:39,910
Should've been 500.

5367
03:28:40,530 --> 03:28:44,110
Okay, how cooked on a scale of 1 to 10 is our Oshis reading?

5368
03:28:44,110 --> 03:28:46,350
Look, I'm just trying to roleplay.

5369
03:28:47,070 --> 03:28:49,770
I'm just roleplaying as the 2 intellect person.

5370
03:28:50,170 --> 03:28:51,530
It's all RP, it's not real.

5371
03:28:51,950 --> 03:28:53,050
Thank you for the super chat!

5372
03:28:53,130 --> 03:28:53,910
Thank you, thank you!

5373
03:28:55,130 --> 03:28:55,570
Okay.

5374
03:28:56,070 --> 03:28:56,710
This way.

5375
03:28:57,330 --> 03:28:58,590
Wait, what the fuck?

5376
03:28:59,090 --> 03:29:00,370
Wait, did I went the wrong way?

5377
03:29:03,210 --> 03:29:04,310
I'm going the wrong way.

5378
03:29:04,510 --> 03:29:05,530
But what's in front of me?

5379
03:29:08,070 --> 03:29:08,950
It's roleplay!

5380
03:29:09,030 --> 03:29:09,830
It's 2 now!

5381
03:29:09,990 --> 03:29:11,110
I learned how to read!

5382
03:29:12,150 --> 03:29:13,650
Guys, it's 2 now!

5383
03:29:15,950 --> 03:29:19,050
I read one book and I increased my intellect.

5384
03:29:19,770 --> 03:29:22,990
It might have been a picture book, but it was a book nonetheless.

5385
03:29:24,710 --> 03:29:25,150
Whoa.

5386
03:29:26,450 --> 03:29:27,410
What's that sound?

5387
03:29:27,510 --> 03:29:28,170
Did you guys hear that?

5388
03:29:30,690 --> 03:29:31,710
Alright, let's see.

5389
03:29:31,930 --> 03:29:32,790
We gotta go this way.

5390
03:29:33,630 --> 03:29:35,330
We gotta head to Diamond City.

5391
03:29:36,650 --> 03:29:38,810
Wait, I'm going further away from Diamond City.

5392
03:29:39,110 --> 03:29:40,370
What the fu- No!

5393
03:29:40,590 --> 03:29:42,690
I fucking tricked myself to go to the settlement!

5394
03:29:42,690 --> 03:29:44,190
This is my marker!

5395
03:29:47,450 --> 03:29:51,290
I almost- I almost tricked myself into going to the settlement.

5396
03:29:55,270 --> 03:29:56,450
Yeah, exactly.

5397
03:29:56,590 --> 03:29:58,390
I literally doubled my intelligence, guys.

5398
03:29:58,670 --> 03:29:59,890
I doubled it.

5399
03:30:01,890 --> 03:30:03,650
Wait, does anyone live here?

5400
03:30:04,950 --> 03:30:06,050
Mystic Pines?

5401
03:30:06,250 --> 03:30:06,830
Who lives here?

5402
03:30:07,490 --> 03:30:08,130
Hello?

5403
03:30:10,770 --> 03:30:11,790
Oh, I can take it!

5404
03:30:11,850 --> 03:30:12,390
People are dead!

5405
03:30:14,930 --> 03:30:15,370
Okay.

5406
03:30:15,910 --> 03:30:16,350
Nice!

5407
03:30:17,370 --> 03:30:19,790
That's what I- What's that sound?

5408
03:30:21,350 --> 03:30:22,490
That's what I like to hear!

5409
03:30:24,510 --> 03:30:25,850
What is that sound?

5410
03:30:27,210 --> 03:30:28,270
Did you guys hear that?

5411
03:30:29,990 --> 03:30:31,870
I'm gonna steal some stuff though, first.

5412
03:30:33,150 --> 03:30:34,150
What is that?

5413
03:30:34,510 --> 03:30:35,230
Who's outside?

5414
03:30:36,090 --> 03:30:36,530
Hello?

5415
03:30:37,390 --> 03:30:38,550
Okay, we're gonna...

5416
03:30:38,550 --> 03:30:39,890
We're gonna...

5417
03:30:41,290 --> 03:30:42,830
We're gonna make sure we don't die.

5418
03:30:45,210 --> 03:30:45,710
Hello?

5419
03:30:47,930 --> 03:30:49,870
I heard that boom, boom, boom.

5420
03:30:53,540 --> 03:30:54,220
Who's that?

5421
03:30:56,440 --> 03:30:57,420
I heard...

5422
03:30:57,420 --> 03:30:58,580
I heard the sound...

5423
03:30:58,580 --> 03:30:59,020
The boom!

5424
03:30:59,380 --> 03:31:00,940
Oh, that's so sad.

5425
03:31:02,280 --> 03:31:03,240
I'm gonna take it.

5426
03:31:05,120 --> 03:31:06,780
The dead don't talk, guys.

5427
03:31:06,780 --> 03:31:08,000
Guys, the dead don't talk.

5428
03:31:08,500 --> 03:31:09,080
It's fine.

5429
03:31:10,020 --> 03:31:11,540
Okay, so there's no bridge.

5430
03:31:12,880 --> 03:31:13,320
And...

5431
03:31:14,120 --> 03:31:14,560
Um...

5432
03:31:15,040 --> 03:31:15,920
Oh, it's this way.

5433
03:31:15,980 --> 03:31:16,160
Okay.

5434
03:31:19,280 --> 03:31:21,100
I think it'll be fine if we go this way.

5435
03:31:21,240 --> 03:31:21,960
We'll be fine.

5436
03:31:23,400 --> 03:31:23,840
Alright.

5437
03:31:23,840 --> 03:31:24,460
Don't worry.

5438
03:31:24,620 --> 03:31:26,860
I have meds to take.

5439
03:31:28,460 --> 03:31:29,940
I can get through this.

5440
03:31:30,580 --> 03:31:31,920
I can also walk around.

5441
03:31:32,300 --> 03:31:33,340
Because it's this way.

5442
03:31:35,340 --> 03:31:36,340
It's so...

5443
03:31:36,340 --> 03:31:39,200
Diamond City, here I come!

5444
03:31:40,760 --> 03:31:42,460
Just a small town girl.

5445
03:31:42,720 --> 03:31:45,120
Trying to make it in a big wide world.

5446
03:31:45,220 --> 03:31:46,820
Big wide radiated world.

5447
03:31:50,640 --> 03:31:51,180
Who's it?

5448
03:31:51,340 --> 03:31:52,480
Ooh, flower.

5449
03:31:53,360 --> 03:31:55,440
I don't know what it does, but I want it.

5450
03:31:56,760 --> 03:31:57,560
Alright, here we go.

5451
03:31:57,940 --> 03:31:59,900
Yeah, I'm on hard mode right now, guys.

5452
03:31:59,940 --> 03:32:01,680
That's why Deathclaw took me 80 years.

5453
03:32:02,580 --> 03:32:03,320
Is there any other game?

5454
03:32:03,320 --> 03:32:04,420
Is there any items I can steal from here?

5455
03:32:04,920 --> 03:32:06,140
There's a box here.

5456
03:32:08,960 --> 03:32:09,980
What's this for?

5457
03:32:11,100 --> 03:32:13,220
Hogsburg is actually so fucking strong.

5458
03:32:13,380 --> 03:32:14,300
I never expected it.

5459
03:32:14,900 --> 03:32:15,820
Alright, nice.

5460
03:32:17,180 --> 03:32:17,780
Let...

5461
03:32:19,040 --> 03:32:22,160
Men suffer five and it's easier to persuade and dialogue.

5462
03:32:22,520 --> 03:32:23,320
Oh my god!

5463
03:32:24,700 --> 03:32:25,300
Wait!

5464
03:32:29,590 --> 03:32:30,970
This is it!

5465
03:32:31,170 --> 03:32:32,930
The ginger plant is working!

5466
03:32:35,070 --> 03:32:35,730
This is it!

5467
03:32:35,850 --> 03:32:37,770
I can finally persuade the men!

5468
03:32:42,450 --> 03:32:43,670
This is it!

5469
03:32:44,010 --> 03:32:45,670
I can finally RIS!

5470
03:32:46,690 --> 03:32:47,610
This is it!

5471
03:32:51,910 --> 03:32:52,950
Holy fuck!

5472
03:32:55,070 --> 03:32:55,870
Here we go.

5473
03:32:56,610 --> 03:32:58,310
Oh no, not the plus one radiation.

5474
03:32:59,570 --> 03:33:00,450
The RIS!

5475
03:33:00,470 --> 03:33:01,050
We're back!

5476
03:33:01,750 --> 03:33:02,390
We're back!

5477
03:33:02,490 --> 03:33:03,310
Wait, what the fuck?

5478
03:33:03,530 --> 03:33:05,590
Oh, I thought that was like a little duck on my screen.

5479
03:33:06,370 --> 03:33:06,890
Wait.

5480
03:33:07,010 --> 03:33:08,010
Where's the...

5481
03:33:09,910 --> 03:33:11,150
Where's my checkpoint?

5482
03:33:11,450 --> 03:33:12,030
Oh, there it is.

5483
03:33:12,230 --> 03:33:13,130
How do I...

5484
03:33:13,130 --> 03:33:14,510
How do I still get lost?

5485
03:33:15,890 --> 03:33:17,590
Wait, is there any items here?

5486
03:33:20,770 --> 03:33:21,370
Hello?

5487
03:33:23,750 --> 03:33:24,810
Oh, Nuka Cola!

5488
03:33:25,090 --> 03:33:25,950
Nuka Cola!

5489
03:33:28,750 --> 03:33:29,350
Memo.

5490
03:33:29,350 --> 03:33:30,270
Inventory checklist.

5491
03:33:31,090 --> 03:33:31,790
Radiation King.

5492
03:33:32,250 --> 03:33:33,190
Radiation King?

5493
03:33:33,330 --> 03:33:35,090
Who the fuck is that Radiation King?

5494
03:33:36,390 --> 03:33:36,990
Radiation King?

5495
03:33:36,990 --> 03:33:38,850
It's just reminding you about the inventory coming in tonight.

5496
03:33:39,050 --> 03:33:44,210
We talked about, like I said, this should remain off the books and kept between as few dock workers as possible.

5497
03:33:44,450 --> 03:33:47,010
The units are heavy and will require the forklift.

5498
03:33:48,210 --> 03:33:48,710
Wait.

5499
03:33:50,270 --> 03:33:51,610
Power is behind me?

5500
03:33:52,210 --> 03:33:53,570
Where's the power armor?

5501
03:33:55,010 --> 03:33:55,730
There is?

5502
03:33:57,250 --> 03:33:58,190
Where is it?

5503
03:33:59,670 --> 03:34:00,530
Where is it?

5504
03:34:03,270 --> 03:34:03,770
Hello?

5505
03:34:03,770 --> 03:34:04,230
Hello?

5506
03:34:08,380 --> 03:34:09,740
Where the power armor at?

5507
03:34:11,300 --> 03:34:13,300
Back to the barricades?

5508
03:34:13,300 --> 03:34:14,600
Like back here?

5509
03:34:16,760 --> 03:34:18,060
Power armor here?

5510
03:34:18,680 --> 03:34:20,080
Oh there it is!

5511
03:34:22,560 --> 03:34:24,000
Guys... guys...

5512
03:34:26,200 --> 03:34:26,920
Cosworth!

5513
03:34:27,160 --> 03:34:28,720
Can you hack your robot?

5514
03:34:29,580 --> 03:34:30,300
Cosworth!

5515
03:34:31,200 --> 03:34:32,840
Cosworth unlock this!

5516
03:34:37,380 --> 03:34:38,020
Please!

5517
03:34:38,020 --> 03:34:39,660
I can't hack it!

5518
03:34:39,700 --> 03:34:40,620
I'm too dumb!

5519
03:34:47,240 --> 03:34:48,940
I'm too stupid!

5520
03:34:49,420 --> 03:34:51,120
I don't understand!

5521
03:34:51,440 --> 03:34:54,800
I was doing so well with my hacking!

5522
03:34:56,500 --> 03:34:57,880
How could this be?

5523
03:34:59,380 --> 03:35:00,720
He actually can?

5524
03:35:01,180 --> 03:35:01,740
Cosworth!

5525
03:35:02,040 --> 03:35:04,500
This is why I got you over Dogmeat!

5526
03:35:07,180 --> 03:35:07,820
Cosworth!

5527
03:35:10,800 --> 03:35:11,900
Cosworth get over here!

5528
03:35:13,380 --> 03:35:13,780
Alright.

5529
03:35:15,060 --> 03:35:15,700
Let's go.

5530
03:35:15,940 --> 03:35:16,760
Cosworth get over here.

5531
03:35:17,080 --> 03:35:18,300
Get over here Cosworth.

5532
03:35:18,420 --> 03:35:19,940
This is exactly why I got you.

5533
03:35:21,220 --> 03:35:22,720
Here you go.

5534
03:35:23,460 --> 03:35:24,240
No way.

5535
03:35:24,800 --> 03:35:25,720
Okay talk.

5536
03:35:26,700 --> 03:35:27,260
Yes.

5537
03:35:29,080 --> 03:35:29,640
Relationship?

5538
03:35:29,660 --> 03:35:30,700
Can I fuck a robot?

5539
03:35:31,160 --> 03:35:31,720
Alright.

5540
03:35:43,420 --> 03:35:43,980
Relationship.

5541
03:35:44,820 --> 03:35:46,780
Yeah how do you feel about us?

5542
03:35:46,800 --> 03:35:48,940
I feel we're more acquaintances than anything.

5543
03:35:49,100 --> 03:35:49,480
What?

5544
03:35:49,820 --> 03:35:51,280
I bought you!

5545
03:35:51,960 --> 03:35:53,840
I programmed you!

5546
03:35:55,000 --> 03:35:55,660
That's all.

5547
03:35:56,620 --> 03:35:58,870
Wait how do I make him...

5548
03:36:01,490 --> 03:36:02,980
Is it an E on the console?

5549
03:36:03,620 --> 03:36:04,240
Father.

5550
03:36:04,600 --> 03:36:06,400
Nothing would please me more.

5551
03:36:06,600 --> 03:36:07,400
Go check that out.

5552
03:36:07,420 --> 03:36:08,060
Go check it out.

5553
03:36:08,080 --> 03:36:08,970
Wait let me...

5554
03:36:10,940 --> 03:36:12,180
Not possible!

5555
03:36:12,920 --> 03:36:14,180
What's your worth?

5556
03:36:14,720 --> 03:36:15,600
What?

5557
03:36:15,780 --> 03:36:18,040
It's not even possible guys.

5558
03:36:18,760 --> 03:36:21,060
He said it's not possible.

5559
03:36:21,120 --> 03:36:22,220
He's too stupid.

5560
03:36:24,400 --> 03:36:26,100
I can't believe it.

5561
03:36:26,200 --> 03:36:28,120
He's also too stupid.

5562
03:36:29,600 --> 03:36:32,760
Take him out on the date first.

5563
03:36:33,340 --> 03:36:34,760
Wait where's the electronics?

5564
03:36:35,140 --> 03:36:36,080
Oh no not...

5565
03:36:36,080 --> 03:36:36,600
No!

5566
03:36:37,020 --> 03:36:40,940
I tricked myself into getting into a loading screen.

5567
03:36:41,780 --> 03:36:43,080
What's this place?

5568
03:36:43,380 --> 03:36:44,480
Where am I?

5569
03:36:46,660 --> 03:36:48,460
What is this place Cogsworth?

5570
03:36:49,520 --> 03:36:50,960
Are there people here?

5571
03:36:51,240 --> 03:36:52,220
Wait what?

5572
03:36:53,360 --> 03:36:55,000
Oh I don't feel safe.

5573
03:36:58,040 --> 03:37:01,320
Oh I don't... I don't feel safe.

5574
03:37:04,260 --> 03:37:06,600
I don't know... I don't know about...

5575
03:37:08,620 --> 03:37:11,900
There is too many electronics out here.

5576
03:37:11,960 --> 03:37:13,060
Oh I don't feel safe.

5577
03:37:13,060 --> 03:37:13,960
What if they activate?

5578
03:37:15,500 --> 03:37:16,840
I'm gonna steal some money though.

5579
03:37:19,960 --> 03:37:20,540
Let's see.

5580
03:37:20,680 --> 03:37:22,060
I'm gonna steal some stuff though.

5581
03:37:25,080 --> 03:37:25,860
I'll be fine.

5582
03:37:25,960 --> 03:37:27,380
They're deactivated right now.

5583
03:37:29,260 --> 03:37:30,140
They're deactivated.

5584
03:37:30,140 --> 03:37:31,020
I can steal some stuff.

5585
03:37:34,040 --> 03:37:35,900
Please assume the position.

5586
03:37:36,360 --> 03:37:39,220
Yeah, I don't feel very safe that...

5587
03:37:39,220 --> 03:37:39,540
Whoa!

5588
03:37:40,840 --> 03:37:41,520
Where is he?

5589
03:37:41,600 --> 03:37:42,040
Where is he?

5590
03:37:42,060 --> 03:37:42,480
Where is he?

5591
03:37:43,060 --> 03:37:43,720
Oh, there he is.

5592
03:37:44,960 --> 03:37:45,740
Okay, nice.

5593
03:37:46,720 --> 03:37:47,620
Oh shit!

5594
03:37:47,660 --> 03:37:49,160
I do not have the ammo for this.

5595
03:37:49,340 --> 03:37:52,340
I just realized I definitely don't have the ammo for this gun.

5596
03:37:52,520 --> 03:37:55,340
So we'll just use the typical 10mm pistol for now.

5597
03:37:56,140 --> 03:37:56,660
Alright.

5598
03:37:56,800 --> 03:37:58,260
So I'm just gonna leave.

5599
03:37:59,000 --> 03:37:59,900
Just gonna leave.

5600
03:38:05,000 --> 03:38:09,200
They seem like the type of robots that won't stay deactivated.

5601
03:38:09,280 --> 03:38:10,820
We have a main goal here!

5602
03:38:11,100 --> 03:38:12,180
The Diamond City!

5603
03:38:13,060 --> 03:38:13,560
Hahaha!

5604
03:38:16,420 --> 03:38:19,960
They look like they can turn on at any second.

5605
03:38:20,160 --> 03:38:21,220
They do!

5606
03:38:21,720 --> 03:38:22,480
They do!

5607
03:38:27,660 --> 03:38:31,080
I must take every junk I see item I take.

5608
03:38:31,160 --> 03:38:32,240
I am a loot goblin.

5609
03:38:34,660 --> 03:38:38,000
War never changes, especially my looting habits.

5610
03:38:39,220 --> 03:38:40,880
Oh my god, this loading screen.

5611
03:38:42,120 --> 03:38:42,940
You wouldn't...

5612
03:38:43,060 --> 03:38:48,080
I think that like after 6 plus years, the loading screen would just be a little bit faster.

5613
03:38:56,440 --> 03:38:57,080
Please.

5614
03:38:58,060 --> 03:38:59,040
It didn't crash!

5615
03:38:59,220 --> 03:38:59,880
It's moving!

5616
03:39:00,240 --> 03:39:01,880
I'm literally looking at it move!

5617
03:39:03,640 --> 03:39:04,920
Nah, I said plus.

5618
03:39:05,260 --> 03:39:08,060
Guys, I made sure to say plus years.

5619
03:39:11,660 --> 03:39:12,300
Please.

5620
03:39:13,440 --> 03:39:14,040
Please.

5621
03:39:14,100 --> 03:39:15,500
No, don't say it crashed!

5622
03:39:16,120 --> 03:39:19,380
Don't say I haven't made it to Diamond City yet!

5623
03:39:19,940 --> 03:39:21,360
I haven't made it!

5624
03:39:22,740 --> 03:39:23,340
Yeah!

5625
03:39:24,380 --> 03:39:28,940
Why is it taking so long?

5626
03:39:33,760 --> 03:39:34,980
No, it's moving!

5627
03:39:35,820 --> 03:39:36,940
It's moving!

5628
03:39:37,180 --> 03:39:39,040
I see the screen moving!

5629
03:39:39,400 --> 03:39:40,000
Hehehe!

5630
03:39:43,880 --> 03:39:44,780
I knew it!

5631
03:39:45,320 --> 03:39:46,500
I fucking knew it!

5632
03:39:46,620 --> 03:39:47,700
I knew it never crashed.

5633
03:39:47,720 --> 03:39:49,180
I've always believed in you, Todd.

5634
03:39:49,180 --> 03:39:49,320
I knew it never crashed.

5635
03:39:49,320 --> 03:39:49,320
I've always believed in you, Todd.

5636
03:39:49,320 --> 03:39:51,460
Todd, don't listen to them.

5637
03:39:51,780 --> 03:39:54,020
Holy shit, why is it so far?

5638
03:39:55,140 --> 03:39:55,660
Hehehehe.

5639
03:39:56,080 --> 03:39:58,720
Todd, I always believed in you.

5640
03:39:58,940 --> 03:40:00,420
And Todd, we trust.

5641
03:40:00,760 --> 03:40:02,020
It just works.

5642
03:40:02,960 --> 03:40:03,480
Hehehehe.

5643
03:40:04,560 --> 03:40:05,480
This is...

5644
03:40:05,480 --> 03:40:07,440
You guys never believed in him.

5645
03:40:07,740 --> 03:40:09,420
That's why your game keeps crashing.

5646
03:40:10,500 --> 03:40:11,020
Hehehehe.

5647
03:40:12,700 --> 03:40:14,220
I should, I should save.

5648
03:40:14,460 --> 03:40:15,520
I should save.

5649
03:40:15,780 --> 03:40:16,840
Alright, this way.

5650
03:40:17,160 --> 03:40:19,300
We don't end stream until I make it to Diamond City.

5651
03:40:19,300 --> 03:40:19,800
Bye, Diamond City.

5652
03:40:20,820 --> 03:40:22,020
This is all I want.

5653
03:40:24,240 --> 03:40:26,240
Somebody is fighting but we're going to ignore him.

5654
03:40:27,900 --> 03:40:29,340
Whoa, what is that?

5655
03:40:29,520 --> 03:40:30,800
What the fuck is that?

5656
03:40:31,720 --> 03:40:32,480
That's a cow.

5657
03:40:33,500 --> 03:40:34,860
Wait, can I loot the cow?

5658
03:40:36,840 --> 03:40:37,520
My god.

5659
03:40:38,200 --> 03:40:39,660
Wait, where is the door to this?

5660
03:40:40,940 --> 03:40:42,220
Wait, I want to loot the cow.

5661
03:40:44,060 --> 03:40:44,500
Okay.

5662
03:40:46,040 --> 03:40:46,960
Can I loot you?

5663
03:40:50,260 --> 03:40:51,960
Please, can you come to me?

5664
03:40:53,440 --> 03:40:55,260
No, why can't I loot the cow?

5665
03:40:58,060 --> 03:40:59,060
If you kill it?

5666
03:40:59,800 --> 03:41:01,020
Can I... should I kill it?

5667
03:41:06,400 --> 03:41:07,900
He doesn't have an owner.

5668
03:41:07,900 --> 03:41:08,680
His owner is dead.

5669
03:41:12,500 --> 03:41:13,200
Oh, I can?

5670
03:41:21,970 --> 03:41:23,130
Go Cogsworth, go!

5671
03:41:23,910 --> 03:41:25,110
Go Cogsworth, go!

5672
03:41:29,780 --> 03:41:30,660
Oh my god.

5673
03:41:31,680 --> 03:41:33,000
Nice, I looted him.

5674
03:41:34,380 --> 03:41:35,180
Get him!

5675
03:41:35,640 --> 03:41:36,720
Alright, nice, alright.

5676
03:41:36,940 --> 03:41:38,180
Woah, what the fuck?

5677
03:41:39,200 --> 03:41:40,940
Why are people fighting?

5678
03:41:41,640 --> 03:41:42,620
I don't understand.

5679
03:41:45,440 --> 03:41:46,560
Not me!

5680
03:41:47,360 --> 03:41:49,340
Look, I only have one mission here.

5681
03:41:49,420 --> 03:41:50,360
I don't need you guys.

5682
03:41:51,100 --> 03:41:51,660
Yay!

5683
03:41:51,840 --> 03:41:52,840
We got beef!

5684
03:41:53,540 --> 03:41:55,420
Guys, we're eating good tonight!

5685
03:41:56,460 --> 03:41:57,020
Dragoons!

5686
03:41:57,460 --> 03:41:59,000
Mama's got some beef!

5687
03:42:00,040 --> 03:42:00,640
Alright, let's go.

5688
03:42:00,660 --> 03:42:01,300
Alright, we're all gonna...

5689
03:42:01,300 --> 03:42:04,100
Okay, all of you guys gotta share one beef though, okay?

5690
03:42:04,420 --> 03:42:05,040
Is that okay?

5691
03:42:05,620 --> 03:42:06,760
Are these good people?

5692
03:42:08,780 --> 03:42:09,580
Hey guys.

5693
03:42:12,140 --> 03:42:12,620
Guys,

5694
03:42:18,420 --> 03:42:19,460
that's not a good place.

5695
03:42:24,660 --> 03:42:26,880
Meat's back on the menu, boys!

5696
03:42:28,820 --> 03:42:31,140
Guys, apparently they were not good people.

5697
03:42:31,260 --> 03:42:35,840
I wanted to talk to her, but she did not want to talk to me for some reason.

5698
03:42:36,400 --> 03:42:38,140
Alright, so we're gonna figure out...

5699
03:42:38,140 --> 03:42:39,640
Oh wait, I can just walk past this bridge.

5700
03:42:39,740 --> 03:42:39,960
Yes.

5701
03:42:40,340 --> 03:42:42,080
It's a little bit radiating water.

5702
03:42:42,620 --> 03:42:43,060
See?

5703
03:42:43,600 --> 03:42:44,040
No.

5704
03:42:44,480 --> 03:42:44,920
No.

5705
03:42:45,140 --> 03:42:45,920
Alright, it's fine.

5706
03:42:46,120 --> 03:42:46,540
We're fine.

5707
03:42:47,460 --> 03:42:50,140
Drinking unpurified water causes radiation damage.

5708
03:42:50,320 --> 03:42:51,640
Well, good thing I'm pure.

5709
03:42:53,040 --> 03:42:54,880
Oh yeah, where's the...

5710
03:42:55,720 --> 03:42:56,520
Oh, it's this way.

5711
03:42:56,520 --> 03:42:56,860
Alright.

5712
03:42:57,220 --> 03:42:59,280
Training tires signal found.

5713
03:43:00,700 --> 03:43:01,980
It's only like...

5714
03:43:01,980 --> 03:43:02,980
10 bananas?

5715
03:43:03,140 --> 03:43:03,540
Exactly!

5716
03:43:04,640 --> 03:43:06,760
I just ate like 10 fucking bananas.

5717
03:43:07,440 --> 03:43:08,520
Where's Cogsworth?

5718
03:43:09,880 --> 03:43:11,000
He'll come back.

5719
03:43:11,160 --> 03:43:11,380
Right?

5720
03:43:14,140 --> 03:43:15,560
He'll be back, guys.

5721
03:43:15,860 --> 03:43:17,580
I just wanna go to Diamond City!

5722
03:43:19,460 --> 03:43:22,280
We're on a pathway to Diamond City!

5723
03:43:22,680 --> 03:43:23,480
Let's go!

5724
03:43:23,860 --> 03:43:24,260
Whoa.

5725
03:43:24,860 --> 03:43:26,160
There's so many...

5726
03:43:26,160 --> 03:43:27,320
empty cities though.

5727
03:43:28,340 --> 03:43:30,200
Yeah, that radiation never hurts.

5728
03:43:30,440 --> 03:43:32,880
Like, if a tumor grows or something, it's just benign.

5729
03:43:33,040 --> 03:43:34,880
It's like a second head like that cow.

5730
03:43:35,160 --> 03:43:36,420
That cow was okay!

5731
03:43:38,740 --> 03:43:39,900
With a second head?

5732
03:43:40,460 --> 03:43:41,740
So I'll be okay.

5733
03:43:43,260 --> 03:43:44,600
Wait, can I rob this guy?

5734
03:43:46,400 --> 03:43:47,300
I hear something.

5735
03:43:48,940 --> 03:43:49,720
Let me see.

5736
03:43:49,840 --> 03:43:50,500
Cogsworth's okay!

5737
03:43:51,660 --> 03:43:52,780
Oh shit, okay.

5738
03:43:55,640 --> 03:43:56,080
No!

5739
03:43:57,400 --> 03:43:58,260
Okay, it's okay.

5740
03:43:58,360 --> 03:43:58,820
I have a lot.

5741
03:44:05,810 --> 03:44:06,250
Okay.

5742
03:44:06,490 --> 03:44:07,310
Oh, no.

5743
03:44:07,690 --> 03:44:08,350
Is it here?

5744
03:44:09,090 --> 03:44:09,530
Yeah!

5745
03:44:12,030 --> 03:44:12,910
Oh shit!

5746
03:44:13,530 --> 03:44:15,210
Did you see that fucking rifle?

5747
03:44:15,810 --> 03:44:17,370
I'm gonna take these coffee cups too.

5748
03:44:17,410 --> 03:44:17,970
And a cigarette.

5749
03:44:18,470 --> 03:44:19,090
Wait, what?

5750
03:44:20,090 --> 03:44:22,150
Oh, it's just modding my...

5751
03:44:22,150 --> 03:44:23,610
No, we don't need to mod anything.

5752
03:44:24,910 --> 03:44:26,390
We don't need to mod anything!

5753
03:44:26,690 --> 03:44:27,630
I'm perfect!

5754
03:44:27,750 --> 03:44:27,770
I'm perfect!

5755
03:44:27,770 --> 03:44:28,790
Wait, is he alive?

5756
03:44:31,010 --> 03:44:33,210
Oh, you're a Diamond City security guard!

5757
03:44:34,030 --> 03:44:35,630
That's where I'm trying to go to!

5758
03:44:37,350 --> 03:44:39,370
It's okay, he didn't see me rob him.

5759
03:44:40,910 --> 03:44:41,410
Yeah!

5760
03:44:48,670 --> 03:44:53,910
He's a Diamond City security guard!

5761
03:44:54,130 --> 03:44:55,410
This is one of their bases?

5762
03:44:56,170 --> 03:44:56,670
Oh!

5763
03:44:57,770 --> 03:44:58,410
Wait, I'm so close!

5764
03:44:58,490 --> 03:44:59,070
Diamond City!

5765
03:45:01,690 --> 03:45:02,410
Hey there.

5766
03:45:02,690 --> 03:45:04,730
Everything outside the wall ain't safe.

5767
03:45:05,330 --> 03:45:05,990
It's just...

5768
03:45:05,990 --> 03:45:09,970
Wait, does that mean if I can bring in like a horde of monsters and then they'll shoot...

5769
03:45:09,970 --> 03:45:10,670
kill them for me?

5770
03:45:12,450 --> 03:45:13,250
Oh my God!

5771
03:45:15,110 --> 03:45:15,590
We're...

5772
03:45:15,590 --> 03:45:16,610
We're almost there!

5773
03:45:21,030 --> 03:45:22,690
Oh my God, there's like turrets and everything.

5774
03:45:23,770 --> 03:45:24,810
We're almost there!

5775
03:45:24,990 --> 03:45:26,470
We're almost at the Helmland!

5776
03:45:27,670 --> 03:45:29,410
We're almost at Diamond City!

5777
03:45:30,050 --> 03:45:32,110
What do you mean you can't open the gate?

5778
03:45:32,570 --> 03:45:34,230
Hello, who are you?

5779
03:45:34,930 --> 03:45:37,030
I'm standing out in the open here for crying out loud.

5780
03:45:37,430 --> 03:45:40,130
I got orders not to let you in, Miss Piper.

5781
03:45:40,450 --> 03:45:41,270
I'm sorry.

5782
03:45:41,510 --> 03:45:42,830
I'm just doing my job.

5783
03:45:44,310 --> 03:45:45,910
Ooh, just doing your job?

5784
03:45:45,990 --> 03:45:48,050
I look like I'm right in the back over there.

5785
03:45:48,230 --> 03:45:48,470
Is that it?

5786
03:45:48,710 --> 03:45:51,290
Oh, look, it's the scary reporter.

5787
03:45:51,890 --> 03:45:55,510
I'm sorry, but Mayor McDonough's really steamed, Piper.

5788
03:45:55,990 --> 03:45:58,170
Saying that article you wrote was all lies.

5789
03:45:58,530 --> 03:45:59,410
Oh, Sidney.

5790
03:45:59,410 --> 03:46:00,110
At least I'm not a traitor.

5791
03:46:00,290 --> 03:46:00,810
At least you're lying.

5792
03:46:00,810 --> 03:46:01,390
What's going on?

5793
03:46:04,770 --> 03:46:07,530
What are you doing?

5794
03:46:07,530 --> 03:46:08,510
Can I kill her accidentally?

5795
03:46:10,690 --> 03:46:11,930
Shoot her in the leg?

5796
03:46:17,630 --> 03:46:18,690
Hello, Piper!

5797
03:46:19,850 --> 03:46:21,450
You went into Diamond City, right?

5798
03:46:21,450 --> 03:46:22,870
Yeah, I went into Diamond City.

5799
03:46:23,890 --> 03:46:24,930
Who are you?

5800
03:46:25,490 --> 03:46:26,010
What?

5801
03:46:26,690 --> 03:46:27,690
Who are you?

5802
03:46:33,320 --> 03:46:34,080
What's that?

5803
03:46:34,240 --> 03:46:36,160
You said you're a traitor or something?

5804
03:46:47,240 --> 03:46:47,720
Yeah!

5805
03:46:52,040 --> 03:46:52,240
Yeah!

5806
03:46:53,240 --> 03:46:54,760
Cogsworth has so many supplies!

5807
03:46:58,580 --> 03:46:59,940
Well, I did it!

5808
03:47:03,480 --> 03:47:07,460
I mean, technically I can open my own store, honestly, with all the stuff I have.

5809
03:47:08,460 --> 03:47:10,380
I got the Diamond City!

5810
03:47:14,700 --> 03:47:15,800
Did I talk to the mayor?

5811
03:47:40,620 --> 03:47:42,460
I'm not sure if I can open it.

5812
03:47:42,460 --> 03:47:43,020
Censorship!

5813
03:47:46,880 --> 03:47:48,720
What newspaper?

5814
03:47:51,420 --> 03:47:54,140
I would never censor my dragoons.

5815
03:47:54,320 --> 03:47:58,480
Because my dragoons are gonna be like, Oh, I love Doki.

5816
03:47:58,680 --> 03:48:00,000
She's so smart.

5817
03:48:00,000 --> 03:48:01,940
And she knows what she's doing.

5818
03:48:02,220 --> 03:48:05,060
And she's like the best gamer out there.

5819
03:48:05,260 --> 03:48:06,520
Right, dragoons?

5820
03:48:07,120 --> 03:48:09,180
I'll never censor you guys.

5821
03:48:09,300 --> 03:48:12,560
Because I know you're gonna always say positive things about me.

5822
03:48:12,780 --> 03:48:13,240
Lies?

5823
03:48:13,340 --> 03:48:14,020
Who said that?

5824
03:48:14,280 --> 03:48:15,040
Who said that?

5825
03:48:15,220 --> 03:48:15,880
Give me a sec.

5826
03:48:16,500 --> 03:48:17,620
Give me a sec, guys.

5827
03:48:25,120 --> 03:48:26,520
Who else would...

5828
03:48:28,740 --> 03:48:31,040
Who else wants to say anything?

5829
03:48:37,060 --> 03:48:37,540
Lies?

5830
03:48:37,560 --> 03:48:37,760
Lies?

5831
03:48:37,840 --> 03:48:39,140
Oh, who said that?

5832
03:48:39,420 --> 03:48:40,380
Who said that?

5833
03:48:41,060 --> 03:48:43,200
Let me put you in a little time out.

5834
03:48:50,600 --> 03:48:53,700
Anyway, I'll never censor my dragoons.

5835
03:48:53,940 --> 03:48:54,520
I would never.

5836
03:48:56,820 --> 03:48:58,440
Support, I hate newspapers.

5837
03:48:58,560 --> 03:49:00,120
This guy must just like to stir up trouble.

5838
03:49:01,700 --> 03:49:02,980
This message has been...

5839
03:49:03,000 --> 03:49:04,840
corrected by Doki.

5840
03:49:05,540 --> 03:49:06,020
Oh,

5841
03:49:10,140 --> 03:49:12,860
I didn't mean to bring you into this argument, miss.

5842
03:49:14,420 --> 03:49:15,240
Doki, back.

5843
03:49:16,140 --> 03:49:17,940
Let me rewrite this real quick.

5844
03:49:19,220 --> 03:49:22,200
Welcome to the great green jewel of the commonwealth.

5845
03:49:22,260 --> 03:49:23,800
Thank you for the super chat, love.

5846
03:49:24,280 --> 03:49:24,980
Doki, good?

5847
03:49:25,240 --> 03:49:26,420
Oh my god, I know.

5848
03:49:26,940 --> 03:49:27,840
Doki's amazing.

5849
03:49:27,940 --> 03:49:28,700
Thank you, love.

5850
03:49:28,780 --> 03:49:29,760
Thank you for the super chat.

5851
03:49:30,460 --> 03:49:32,340
Tell you otherwise, all right?

5852
03:49:33,340 --> 03:49:35,000
Uh, you two arguing?

5853
03:49:39,960 --> 03:49:42,220
Trevor, thank you for the magenta soup.

5854
03:49:42,300 --> 03:49:42,820
Thank you.

5855
03:49:46,720 --> 03:49:47,320
Lies?

5856
03:49:47,320 --> 03:49:48,560
There's no lies here.

5857
03:49:49,320 --> 03:49:50,620
Dragoon media headline.

5858
03:49:51,640 --> 03:49:52,640
Smart brain.

5859
03:49:53,080 --> 03:49:54,300
20 intellect.

5860
03:49:54,800 --> 03:49:56,660
All charisma, Oshii.

5861
03:49:56,860 --> 03:49:57,940
Oh my gosh, I know.

5862
03:49:58,080 --> 03:49:59,420
Thank you for the magenta soup.

5863
03:49:59,480 --> 03:50:00,000
Thank you.

5864
03:50:00,120 --> 03:50:00,580
Thank you.

5865
03:50:00,660 --> 03:50:01,480
Missing person.

5866
03:50:03,000 --> 03:50:03,860
Trying to find someone?

5867
03:50:04,060 --> 03:50:04,520
Who?

5868
03:50:06,500 --> 03:50:09,800
Uh, might be a miss- a boy.

5869
03:50:10,100 --> 03:50:10,780
An infant boy.

5870
03:50:12,060 --> 03:50:12,620
Kidnapped.

5871
03:50:13,520 --> 03:50:14,880
Did you say kidnapped?

5872
03:50:15,820 --> 03:50:18,920
Well, McDonough, Diamond City Security is investigating this.

5873
03:50:18,940 --> 03:50:21,680
Thank you for the super chat.

5874
03:50:21,800 --> 03:50:21,980
Thank you.

5875
03:50:22,520 --> 03:50:26,600
I'm afraid that our security team can't follow every case that comes through.

5876
03:50:26,680 --> 03:50:28,860
I'm confident that you can find help here.

5877
03:50:29,160 --> 03:50:32,540
Diamond City has every conceivable service known to man.

5878
03:50:32,540 --> 03:50:35,520
One of our great citizens can surely find the title.

5879
03:50:35,600 --> 03:50:37,400
They know where my boy is?

5880
03:50:38,480 --> 03:50:39,760
Oh my god, he's a man.

5881
03:50:40,040 --> 03:50:41,340
I have better persuasion.

5882
03:50:41,640 --> 03:50:43,980
A mayor of a great city must know everyone.

5883
03:50:44,680 --> 03:50:45,800
Who can help me?

5884
03:50:45,940 --> 03:50:46,880
I'm sorry, I don't have time for this anymore.

5885
03:50:46,940 --> 03:50:47,420
No!

5886
03:50:48,700 --> 03:50:51,480
It's cause- it's cause he doesn't like women.

5887
03:50:51,660 --> 03:50:52,360
You can tell.

5888
03:50:52,500 --> 03:50:54,740
You can tell that he's like- he's gay.

5889
03:50:55,180 --> 03:50:55,600
This is ridiculous.

5890
03:50:55,600 --> 03:50:57,880
Diamond City S- Settled in, but um...

5891
03:50:58,380 --> 03:50:59,880
It's not Zero Riz!

5892
03:50:59,900 --> 03:51:01,040
I'm not his preference!

5893
03:51:01,640 --> 03:51:01,660
I'm not his preference!

5894
03:51:01,660 --> 03:51:03,260
For an article you'd be perfect for.

5895
03:51:08,580 --> 03:51:09,880
You can tell!

5896
03:51:10,740 --> 03:51:12,440
He's not into women!

5897
03:51:12,640 --> 03:51:13,480
That's why!

5898
03:51:17,360 --> 03:51:19,340
You can tell he's not into women!

5899
03:51:19,820 --> 03:51:21,640
Why else would my persuasion not work?

5900
03:51:22,240 --> 03:51:24,060
I died!

5901
03:51:25,700 --> 03:51:27,480
Censored and cancelled.

5902
03:51:30,580 --> 03:51:31,700
Head on inside.

5903
03:51:31,940 --> 03:51:35,540
Get on insi- How is that Gatsable?

5904
03:51:35,840 --> 03:51:37,260
He's not straight!

5905
03:51:37,560 --> 03:51:39,160
Why else would he say no?

5906
03:51:40,460 --> 03:51:42,160
Why else would he say no?

5907
03:51:43,160 --> 03:51:43,800
Guys...

5908
03:51:44,340 --> 03:51:45,180
Look at me!

5909
03:51:45,780 --> 03:51:48,440
I'm peak wasteland woman!

5910
03:51:56,300 --> 03:51:56,940
Whoa!

5911
03:51:56,940 --> 03:51:58,220
Look at Diamond City.

5912
03:51:58,540 --> 03:51:59,820
It's a fucking shithole.

5913
03:52:06,350 --> 03:52:08,290
Why else would my persuasion not work?

5914
03:52:08,370 --> 03:52:09,130
I don't understand!

5915
03:52:10,910 --> 03:52:13,650
The stream was down for a few seconds.

5916
03:52:13,870 --> 03:52:17,290
He has... Are you trying to say I give zero standards?

5917
03:52:19,070 --> 03:52:22,410
He said he's gay like seven times.

5918
03:52:23,070 --> 03:52:24,710
Thank you for the super chat.

5919
03:52:24,770 --> 03:52:25,250
Thank you.

5920
03:52:25,270 --> 03:52:25,830
Thank you.

5921
03:52:33,970 --> 03:52:35,310
I will be back for you soon if you don't replace me.

5922
03:52:36,170 --> 03:52:39,070
You've been saying that for weeks and the old girl still keeps cranking.

5923
03:52:39,470 --> 03:52:41,070
Stop worrying so much.

5924
03:52:41,990 --> 03:52:43,150
Now I gotta head into the office.

5925
03:52:43,150 --> 03:52:45,610
He just said he's gay and then died.

5926
03:52:46,170 --> 03:52:47,190
He's coming our way.

5927
03:52:47,290 --> 03:52:47,410
Why?

5928
03:52:47,710 --> 03:52:48,690
Is something wrong?

5929
03:52:50,050 --> 03:52:50,490
Piper?

5930
03:52:51,770 --> 03:52:55,630
The streamer is so bad it gave the streamer a stroke.

5931
03:52:56,150 --> 03:52:57,470
Thank you for the super chat.

5932
03:52:57,590 --> 03:52:57,870
Thank you.

5933
03:52:57,970 --> 03:52:58,490
Thank you.

5934
03:52:58,850 --> 03:53:01,970
Alright, I think this is a good time to call it here guys.

5935
03:53:02,190 --> 03:53:02,610
I think...

5936
03:53:03,970 --> 03:53:04,850
We made it to Diamond City!

5937
03:53:05,610 --> 03:53:07,590
Oh my god, we did it!

5938
03:53:08,450 --> 03:53:09,370
We did it!

5939
03:53:09,430 --> 03:53:10,810
Our self-imposed mission!

5940
03:53:12,810 --> 03:53:14,290
Yeah, thank you for the super chat!

5941
03:53:14,410 --> 03:53:15,290
Thank you, thank you!

5942
03:53:15,290 --> 03:53:17,270
Looks like someone needs a little more charisma!

5943
03:53:18,670 --> 03:53:20,010
Thank you for the super chat!

5944
03:53:20,150 --> 03:53:20,390
Thank you!

5945
03:53:21,570 --> 03:53:23,270
That's been fun so far though.

5946
03:53:23,530 --> 03:53:25,130
I can't wait to do more.

5947
03:53:25,250 --> 03:53:26,670
Oh my gosh, we're already sidetracked.

5948
03:53:26,710 --> 03:53:28,010
This is not gonna go so well.

5949
03:53:28,130 --> 03:53:32,250
We're already so sidetracked with everything.

5950
03:53:37,550 --> 03:53:40,570
So, I have a feeling it's not...

5951
03:53:40,570 --> 03:53:43,910
It's not gonna go well.

5952
03:53:46,010 --> 03:53:48,330
Of course part 2 is happening.

5953
03:53:48,590 --> 03:53:50,510
It's in my stream schedule.

5954
03:53:50,670 --> 03:53:51,250
It's in my sketch.

5955
03:53:51,530 --> 03:53:54,230
So yeah, I can't wait to do another part 2.

5956
03:53:54,310 --> 03:53:56,470
It's been so fun so far.

5957
03:53:56,990 --> 03:53:59,250
I'm already super sidetracked.

5958
03:53:59,430 --> 03:54:00,790
So there's...

5959
03:54:03,230 --> 03:54:05,530
There's like, definitely a lot of stuff.

5960
03:54:05,610 --> 03:54:08,450
I don't even know where the main storyline is, to be fair.

5961
03:54:08,690 --> 03:54:12,270
I have no idea where the main storyline is at the moment.

5962
03:54:12,370 --> 03:54:13,510
So this is gonna be...

5963
03:54:13,970 --> 03:54:15,630
This is gonna be a little rough.

5964
03:54:17,250 --> 03:54:20,230
I have no idea how many parts we're gonna fall out for.

5965
03:54:20,430 --> 03:54:21,930
But I had a great time!

5966
03:54:22,090 --> 03:54:23,190
Everybody had a great time.

5967
03:54:23,650 --> 03:54:27,950
I would love to do like a little Zzatzon at the end, but I'm very very busy today.

5968
03:54:28,390 --> 03:54:28,830
So...

5969
03:54:29,390 --> 03:54:32,250
We did talk a little bit before we started today.

5970
03:54:32,510 --> 03:54:32,890
So...

5971
03:54:32,890 --> 03:54:35,650
We did have a little chatting stream before we started.

5972
03:54:35,850 --> 03:54:36,150
But...

5973
03:54:36,150 --> 03:54:38,410
Anyway guys, I had a great time with all of you.

5974
03:54:38,510 --> 03:54:40,110
I hope you guys had a great time watching me.

5975
03:54:40,430 --> 03:54:43,390
And as always, everybody stay hydrated.

5976
03:54:44,030 --> 03:54:44,570
Posture check.

5977
03:54:44,570 --> 03:54:46,410
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

5978
03:54:46,550 --> 03:54:48,270
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

5979
03:54:48,370 --> 03:54:49,530
Cause you deserve it!

5980
03:54:49,650 --> 03:54:50,850
I'll see you guys next time everybody!

5981
03:54:51,410 --> 03:54:52,090
Bye guys!

5982
03:54:52,850 --> 03:54:53,250
Bye!
