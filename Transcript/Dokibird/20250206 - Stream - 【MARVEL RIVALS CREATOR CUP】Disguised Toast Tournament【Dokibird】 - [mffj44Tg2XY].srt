1
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,160
Yeah, he's the Groot, right?

2
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,840
Yeah, Bogred messaged me last night.

3
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,020
He's like, I'm gonna ban Groot first thing.

4
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,060
And I was like, oh, okay.

5
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,740
We could just ban the Strange.

6
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,720
I just got the Celestial.

7
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,720
I didn't play Rank, like, for two weeks.

8
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:13,160
And then yesterday, I just grinded from Celestial 3 to 1, so...

9
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,780
I was like, I literally got back from Japan.

10
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,120
At like 5, and I was like, oh, fuck, okay.

11
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,240
I need to play.

12
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,340
Let's go.

13
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,080
Wait, I was bragging about being Plat 1.

14
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,960
You're Celestial?

15
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,800
What the fuck?

16
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,800
That's not even high.

17
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,460
It's not even Eternity.

18
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,520
Wait, am I the most assed one then?

19
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,240
Cause...

20
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,480
No, isn't it?

21
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,280
Yeah, see?

22
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,920
This team is actually kind of high rated.

23
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,700
I think we can extend a massive chance here.

24
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:52,460
I think we could just ban... If we ban Bogr's Strange, then, like, both our tank players aren't playing their mains.

25
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,840
So, like...

26
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,200
Cause I know Bogr's banning Groot.

27
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,100
He literally just...

28
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,800
He, like, the first thing he messaged me was just, I'm banning Groot for your team.

29
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,740
I was like, okay.

30
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,540
Yeah, but I can play all the tanks.

31
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,000
So we just play it then, like...

33
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,240
I mostly play Strategist.

34
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:15,840
But I can play, like, Punisher or Hella for DPS.

35
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:18,900
Mmm...

36
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:19,580
Both are good.

37
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,520
I think if we play Raccoon, then they play Punisher.

38
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,280
I think we just hold that thing on their shield.

39
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,700
Yeah, I can play a Raccoon for a Punisher.

40
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,020
No, I'm not gonna lie.

41
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,700
Listen, listen.

42
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:32,400
I'm like a... I can make strats for us, whatever, on the fly.

43
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,020
Like, we could beat better teams, right?

44
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,460
We're just, like, better strats.

45
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:43,600
Like, if they're playing, like, tanks or whatever, and their best are on tank, and we're having a hard time...

46
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,500
We don't even play Raccoon.

47
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,940
We don't even play Squirrel Girl.

48
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,640
Maybe I'll have you on Punisher, and you just left-click the shields and the walls, and then they can't do anything.

49
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:51,960
Okay.

50
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,960
Yeah, they're not used to playing against Squirrel Girl, so it's, like, a huge surprise, too.

51
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,520
They're like, what the fuck do we do?

52
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,660
Wait, does nobody really play her?

53
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,860
She's so fun to play.

54
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,900
I avoid every Squirrel player I see.

55
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,600
Some players, some players.

56
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:14,100
If any of you are really good at DPS, the other healer I've played is Rocket.

57
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,780
So I can do Rocket if I need to.

58
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,820
I mean, we could run triple support if we're desperate.

59
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,020
Okay.

60
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,420
That's, like, the desperate strat.

61
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,600
Yeah, we do.

62
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,820
Does anyone have xQc on their friends list?

63
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,720
I'm in the lobby right now.

64
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,260
My name is pvc in the game.

65
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:33,980
Just add pvc.

66
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:34,700
Huh?

67
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,480
Add pvc, please.

68
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,200
I'm not gonna lie, man, you're gonna have to type that.

69
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,700
You're gonna have to type it.

70
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,320
pvc, pvc.

71
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:43,900
Fell off?

72
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,820
Is that your group?

73
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,340
Yes, yes, fell off.

74
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,720
Invite, please.

75
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,820
I added and invited.

76
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,720
Yeah, thank you.

77
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,940
And invite, I don't see it yet.

78
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,400
Oh, can I get an invite?

79
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,260
Are you saying pvc or bbc?

80
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:00,660
pvc.

81
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,000
Yeah, I got it.

82
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,620
Who asked for an invite?

83
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,200
Okay.

84
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,740
Wait, do I see...

85
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,240
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, their team is straight bonkers.

86
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,460
Huge balls, come on in.

87
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,600
Thank you, thank you.

88
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,860
Okay, okay, by the way, guys, I play a lot of Penny.

89
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,720
I can sort of play Magneto.

90
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,100
I can also support for us.

91
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,800
So I'm very like tank, support, fill.

92
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:32,480
I feel like actually this works out so well because I think we have the exact amount of players for each role, right?

93
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,440
Yeah, I think so.

94
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:34,760
Yeah.

95
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,880
Does anyone know what the first map is or is it like randomized?

96
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,140
I have no idea how, I think it'll be a random map.

97
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,100
I thought we could choose our map.

98
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,800
I think each team gets to pick one.

99
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:51,700
Yeah.

100
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,220
All right.

101
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,820
So we're doing like, oh, so who's picking first then?

102
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,560
I have no clue.

103
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,480
Oh, it's not random?

104
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,140
Oh, no, I didn't read the rules.

105
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,400
Toast was like, you want to join?

106
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,280
I was like, yeah.

107
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,940
That's really it.

108
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,680
Do we know who we want to reserve?

109
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,260
I think Scroll Girl.

110
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,440
Oh, that's a good idea.

111
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:21,660
Maybe.

112
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,200
Unless they didn't research, if they didn't, I don't, it's a forefront term.

113
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,320
There's no way they researched.

114
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:30,400
They probably have like a Marvel Rivals like tracker website pulled up right now.

115
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,300
Yeah, they're just like, what's the scene at play with the Scroll Girl icon?

116
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,260
That's why I have a Black Panther icon on, so people don't know.

117
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:38,760
It's a suit.

118
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,500
Throw them off.

119
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,680
If they don't ban Groot, do we want to save that?

120
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,560
No, not really.

121
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,540
I can play the other ones.

122
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,220
They're just as good.

123
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:50,660
Okay.

124
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,060
Is it Discord overlay down or is it just me?

125
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,300
No, it's working.

126
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,780
Oh, that's weird.

127
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,340
It's not working for me.

128
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,920
The ones that they have that they always give us are pretty bad.

129
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:09,180
I like the one that doesn't have, I think, above it and only ticks whenever you're talking.

130
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,680
I'll make my own, I think.

131
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,800
Do you have a Discord admin?

132
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:14,900
I do.

133
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,600
I don't, actually.

134
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:21,140
I do, but for some reason, it's not working for me, which is weird.

135
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,360
No, Discord just had their big update today.

136
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,480
Yeah.

137
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,500
Yeah, it says the resource is being rate limited.

138
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,060
I was like, what the fuck does that mean?

139
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:33,920
Yeah, I don't know.

140
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,060
Tech doesn't know me.

141
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,060
Yeah, they tweaked their layout a little bit.

142
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,420
Oh, I didn't even notice.

143
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,060
I don't think mine is updated yet.

144
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,200
Is it bad?

145
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,620
Because then I'll try to stop it.

146
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:48,980
I don't know.

147
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:55,040
Like, I saw someone tweet like a side-by-side comparison and the differences was like very minimum.

148
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,020
So...

149
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:56,380
Okay.

150
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:01,010
Dude, I'm not gonna lie.

151
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:06,850
I thought that, like, you guys were around my ranking and I wasn't gonna be the noob on the team.

152
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:08,650
And I didn't know that all of you guys were like...

153
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:09,810
No, it's like each row is its own tier.

154
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:12,730
Yeah, you guys are crazy.

155
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,590
But you're not gold.

156
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:18,670
Okay, like some people on the other team.

157
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,050
Oh, hey, but Shoto is...

158
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,650
Wasn't Shoto in Vacation too?

159
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,730
I was gonna say, I assumed...

160
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:28,450
I think I've played with Shoto before.

161
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:29,690
Wasn't he like Grandmaster?

162
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,430
No, he peaked Diamond.

163
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:32,890
He peaked Diamond.

164
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,830
Yeah, but they moved him down.

165
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:36,470
For...

166
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,610
For...

167
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:39,010
Another player.

168
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:41,250
I'm hearing some rumors right now.

169
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:42,990
Oh, what's the rumor?

170
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:44,510
What rumors?

171
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:45,430
Somebody said it.

172
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:48,370
Senna is black, but she's actually silver in disguise.

173
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:53,770
We're ready, right?

174
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,250
That's so bad.

175
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,050
I mean, I bet that guy is bad.

176
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,630
Tell me that wasn't one of your mods, because I know it wasn't.

177
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,190
I'm not fucking silver, man.

178
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:05,290
Tell me you can't get the Platinum 1 with only Squirrel Girl.

179
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:06,250
Who can do that?

180
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,690
I've seen Squirrel Girls in one of them all.

181
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,490
I've been bragging about Plat 1 this whole time.

182
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,270
Is that not even good?

183
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,310
No, honestly, I think...

184
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,050
I think Plat 1 is pretty good.

185
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:22,610
Yeah, Plat 1 is really good.

186
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,390
I think Plat C...

187
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,970
Is that one tier away from Diamond, or...?

188
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,650
Yeah, that's one tier away from Diamond, yeah.

189
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:29,110
Yeah.

190
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:32,350
There are some people that will never get out of Bronze.

191
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:32,990
Ever.

192
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:33,790
In their life.

193
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:34,290
Okay.

194
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,430
Be proud.

195
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:36,870
Yeah.

196
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:39,030
Yeah, and you got out of there with Squirrel Girl.

197
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,910
Maybe Wolverine?

198
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:44,770
Does that...

199
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:45,270
I think...

200
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,350
Does any of them play Wolverine?

201
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,250
Yeah, we should ban Wolverine for sure.

202
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:48,490
Yeah.

203
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:49,910
It counters almost all of our characters.

204
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:50,510
Yeah.

205
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:51,450
I banned it.

206
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:53,230
Nice.

207
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,510
And then maybe...

208
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:54,830
I don't know.

209
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,450
I know Booger plays Bruce.

210
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,090
If he can't play Strange.

211
00:09:59,430 --> 00:09:59,790
So...

212
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,430
Oh, there he goes.

213
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:02,970
Yeah, but they saved now.

214
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:05,230
He's gonna save Strange.

215
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,010
Who do we wanna save?

216
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,690
I feel like we don't really need to save anybody in general.

217
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,510
Yeah, I don't think we're gonna ban anybody we play.

218
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,410
No, now we have to ban Strange because they're gonna run Gamma.

219
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:18,390
We could...

220
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,570
We have to save someone.

221
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:20,250
Yeah.

222
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:21,670
Save Strange.

223
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:22,390
Oh, I saved Strange.

224
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:22,690
Yeah, because...

225
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:23,170
Yeah, no, no.

226
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:23,630
And then I ban Bruce.

227
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:24,910
Wait, why?

228
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,450
Because I have to play Strange with Penny.

229
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,070
Oh, yeah.

230
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,570
Oh, is it the only thing you can play?

231
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:32,010
No, no, it works with Penny the best.

232
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:32,970
Oh!

233
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:33,330
Yeah.

234
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,270
We need a shield.

235
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:38,330
We could just ban another support so they can't run Trip Support.

236
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:39,390
We ban Hela?

237
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:40,850
Sure, we ban Hela, yeah.

238
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:41,770
Yeah.

239
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,650
Oh, it's so over.

240
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:45,830
No, it's not.

241
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:46,390
Wait, why?

242
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:46,870
Why?

243
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:47,130
Why?

244
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:50,130
Guys, I've never even seen the ban screen before.

245
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,970
I knew it!

246
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:53,630
Oh, wow.

247
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,630
They really want those skins.

248
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,630
But I didn't want to be that guy.

249
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:00,790
They really want those skins.

250
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,850
Are we running Trip Support, everyone?

251
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,710
Yeah, we can run this for Trip Support.

252
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,220
Who could it be?

253
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,200
So, four supports, maybe?

254
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,800
Maybe just play Poki.

255
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,440
I'll switch to Rocket, I'll switch to Rocket.

256
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,180
If you're going Punisher, Lulu.

257
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

258
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,540
Triple Sup Rocket, Punisher is actually better.

259
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,280
Poki, do you want to play...

260
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,840
I can play any...

261
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,840
I can play any support.

262
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,220
We shouldn't run Rocket as a duo support.

263
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,800
It doesn't work that way.

264
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,000
Okay.

265
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,240
I can play Cloak as well.

266
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,340
Yeah, can we just go Trip Support?

267
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:51,840
Yeah.

268
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,260
Yeah, Trip Support actually kind of collapses.

269
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,340
It's meta, it's meta.

270
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,020
Yeah, Trip Support is good.

271
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:00,800
It's good, but we can't have Rocket as a duo support.

272
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,480
Yeah, this is good.

273
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,000
This comp actually works.

274
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,980
I'll just put... I'll put it on...

275
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,320
The Snowflake on the next QC.

276
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,940
So you will never die.

277
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,300
The most annoying character lineup ever.

278
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:11,900
I love it.

279
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,220
This is an interesting lineup.

280
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,440
I'm careful on the ult.

281
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,440
I'll try to freeze.

282
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,420
I'll try to freeze the ult.

283
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,340
Oh, Iron Man up top.

284
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,140
Can you get me an Infinite around this corner?

285
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:23,620
Yeah.

286
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,460
I'm walking up.

287
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,160
Yeah, I'm pushing up, pushing up.

288
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,580
It's kind of hard for me to hit Iron Man's FYI, so...

289
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,280
I'll try, but...

290
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:37,860
I'll try to shoot him too.

291
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,360
There's a Hulk behind us, Hulk behind.

292
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,160
Yeah, he's destroying the respawn.

293
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,700
He's low, he's half.

294
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,140
He's gonna die.

295
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,920
Have him out of the...

296
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,320
He's literally one shot, but...

297
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,720
He's healed, he's healed, he's healed.

298
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:51,520
I'm in the back.

299
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:52,540
Okay.

300
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,220
Um, what do you have now?

301
00:12:59,440 --> 00:12:59,960
I'm getting one.

302
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:00,280
Got him.

303
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:00,820
Nice.

304
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:01,440
Tracer's low.

305
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,160
Iron Man dead.

306
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,220
I have, uh...

307
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:05,920
the...

308
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,860
Relay and one.

309
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,500
Push up with XTC.

310
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,820
Oh, Tracer's half, Tracer's half, Tracer's half.

311
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,960
Tracer's low, Tracer's low.

312
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,700
Tracer's low, Tracer's low.

313
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:14,640
Tracer's one, Tracer's one.

314
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,400
Still one, still one.

315
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,260
You push it, you push it.

316
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:21,150
Nice.

317
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:23,010
Oh.

318
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:23,370
Ooh.

319
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:24,050
Sorry.

320
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:25,950
I can't see XTC.

321
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:30,150
Use ult if you have to, use ult if you have to.

322
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:31,770
I don't have ult, I don't have support ult yet.

323
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:32,170
No, no, no.

324
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:33,590
Oh, I didn't need to ult.

325
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:34,790
I... I have a 75.

326
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:35,850
I got it, I got it.

327
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:36,670
I got mine, I got mine.

328
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:37,430
Nice.

329
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:38,330
Just push up with him.

330
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,250
Push up, push up, push up.

331
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:40,250
If you guys want me to.

332
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:42,630
Okay, I'll ult after.

333
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,570
I'm coming back with Punisher ult.

334
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,530
They have Hulk ult.

335
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:45,630
I'm damage boosting.

336
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:46,530
Yup, yup, yup, yup.

337
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,250
Three, two, one.

338
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:48,950
I got the Lucio.

339
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:51,290
Both Lucio dead, both Lucio dead.

340
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:53,290
Still have it, still have it, still have it.

341
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:53,870
It's in the boost, it's in the boost.

342
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,410
We're even, we're even, we're even, we're even.

343
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:57,870
We're up one, we're up one.

344
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:59,430
Can you guys push up, can you guys push up?

345
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:01,470
You can kill the Mantis, she only has one personal.

346
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:01,690
I'm dead, I'm dead.

347
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:04,310
I'll bubble here, I'll bubble here.

348
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:06,930
I got your ult.

349
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:08,670
And I don't got you.

350
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,570
Hey, sub, did they Hulk ult that?

351
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:17,370
Uh, no.

352
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:18,630
Please don't have it.

353
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,430
Oh my god, I didn't even...

354
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,530
Oh, strange was half.

355
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:24,630
They only used one support ult for that fight.

356
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:25,450
Keep doing what you're doing now.

357
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:27,810
Just pressure tanks, pressure ground, then we're chilling.

358
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:29,110
We're doing really good.

359
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,670
We still have one more support ult.

360
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:31,590
I'm almost right here.

361
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,190
I could die.

362
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:35,450
Strange is... oh, he's too weak.

363
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:37,750
Hulk has.

364
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,200
I'm going around to try to get their healers here.

365
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:44,880
Yep.

366
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,960
I'm gonna follow you.

367
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,400
Oh, no.

368
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,880
You guys are kind of split on the left side.

369
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,460
You guys, you guys, we're winning, we're winning, we're winning.

370
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,860
Am I getting ult?

371
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:57,980
There you go.

372
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,780
Oh my god.

373
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,020
I'm coming back with a Punisher ult again.

374
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,700
Oh, I couldn't get it off.

375
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:06,600
He interrupted.

376
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,240
No.

377
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,080
I got Agamotto'd.

378
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:10,680
Yeah.

379
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:11,400
Reset, reset.

380
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,360
Reset it, reset it, reset it, reset it.

381
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,400
We'll have to ult the last point.

382
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,500
One last fight.

383
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,380
What support ults do they have?

384
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:18,960
Uh...

385
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,320
They don't have Invis.

386
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:20,780
They should have Cloak.

387
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:21,560
They just used Invis.

388
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:22,940
They should have Cloak.

389
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,600
Just assume support ults.

390
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,680
I'll have Cloak ult in 20%.

391
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,860
They have Mantis Cloak.

392
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:29,980
They used Train.

393
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:30,920
They should have Hulk ult.

394
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,040
Just focus Train.

395
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:35,900
Focus Train, focus Train.

396
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:36,460
Kill him, kill him.

397
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,240
I'm blocking him, I'm blocking him.

398
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,120
He's half.

399
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,920
Just go into him, go into him, go into him really hard.

400
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,980
I froze him, I froze him.

401
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,600
I got killed by my ult.

402
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,480
I got killed by everything.

403
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,860
They used Cloak as well.

404
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:49,240
This is good.

405
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,560
Make sure you use Luna, Luna.

406
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,260
I'm waiting.

407
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:52,840
Do we have Luna ult?

408
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,220
Luna ult?

409
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,020
Yeah, we need it, we need it.

410
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,420
Okay, I used mine.

411
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:56,460
Nice.

412
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,280
Last fight, last fight.

413
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:57,760
Use everything you have.

414
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,040
Stay on my ult.

415
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,360
Stay on my ult if you can.

416
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:04,260
Nice.

417
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,140
I'm damage boosting this.

418
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:05,740
I'm damage boosting.

419
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:06,960
Train, Train, Train.

420
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:07,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

421
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:08,620
I got you, I got you.

422
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,560
YOLO dude, YOLO dude, YOLO dude.

423
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,320
Nice, nice.

424
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:11,720
Someone's up top.

425
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,580
Someone's up here.

426
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,320
This Hulker is kind of low.

427
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,120
I don't think we can let him out.

428
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,080
Nice.

429
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:19,880
Okay.

430
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,680
He's coming back in, he's coming back in, he's coming back in.

431
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,120
I couldn't freeze him in time.

432
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,020
They're going to TP, they're going to TP.

433
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:26,840
Focus Hulk, focus Hulk.

434
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,680
He's one, he's one, he's one.

435
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,300
Focus him, focus him, focus him.

436
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,140
Strange Hab, Strange Hab.

437
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,780
Strange one, strange one.

438
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,720
Nice, nice.

439
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,880
Cloak, Cloak, focus Cloak.

440
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,120
I froze her, I froze her.

441
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:40,920
Nice.

442
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,740
Good job guys.

443
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,260
Good freeze.

444
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,880
Yo, keep doing that.

445
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,960
Like, we need to just pressure the tanks really hard.

446
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,400
See, like, their Hulk is not diving.

447
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,940
We need to just keep doing that.

448
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,300
Otherwise he dives and we get cucked.

449
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,540
Someone's going to play up with you.

450
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,720
Nice guys, good job.

451
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,980
We're in this, let's go.

452
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:55,580
This is really good.

453
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,020
Pushing first is really, really hard here.

454
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,800
Wait guys, can we triple push the payload?

455
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm using any of my support ult.

456
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:01,460
I'm coming back, I'm coming back.

457
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,600
Yeah, they're going to ult Cloak anyway.

458
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,980
Yeah, let's get out of this Cloak.

459
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:07,780
I hate this Cloak.

460
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,440
Hulk, Hulk coming up.

461
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,700
Hulk is down, Hulk down.

462
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:14,740
I'm stunned here.

463
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:19,780
I'm on Tracer.

464
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,800
Yeah, for the tanks, for the tanks.

465
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,540
Change ult, change ult.

466
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:23,280
Tracer's solo.

467
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,040
Change one.

468
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,040
Tracer's solo here.

469
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,860
I froze ult, I froze ult.

470
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:27,600
I'm back gap, I'm back gap.

471
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,780
I can't be in the ult.

472
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,780
Back gap, back gap, back gap.

473
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,260
Don't use ult, don't use ult.

474
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,720
We're one down one right now.

475
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,580
I'm trying to freeze them.

476
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:37,820
Oh no.

477
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,200
This is good, this is good, this is good.

478
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,780
Yeah, just don't use anything.

479
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,820
They used Hulk ult and invisible woman for this.

480
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:49,650
I have ult.

481
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:51,650
I have ult in 10.

482
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:54,210
I think I can, I can...

483
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:59,170
I can ult for our Punisher and then you can just walk forward with it.

484
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:01,110
I don't see Hulk.

485
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:02,350
Yeah, I think they're just playing main.

486
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:03,790
Yeah, Hulk is over here.

487
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:05,250
I'm just pushing tanks, pushing tanks here.

488
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:06,850
I'm down for that.

489
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:08,710
Yeah, just ult when they have ult.

490
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:09,210
If you ult, I'll ult.

491
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,590
He's solo, he's solo.

492
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:13,930
Got you, I got you.

493
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:14,450
Oh good.

494
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,430
I'm damage boosting, I'm damage boosting it.

495
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:16,690
He'll do it, he'll do it.

496
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,590
Damage boost, push forward, push forward, damage boost.

497
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:21,770
Just keep pushing forward.

498
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,050
We have cold ult.

499
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,150
Nice.

500
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:26,490
Push up, let's go.

501
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:30,470
We have no defensive ult so we have to be aggressive here.

502
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:31,810
Oh, I can TP them.

503
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:32,870
Nah, they're gonna TP themselves.

504
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,850
They have, they have Bucky ult here.

505
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,250
Okay, we have Raccoon ult early.

506
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:44,650
We need the Raccoon ult early to pressure up.

507
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,210
Yeah, you should call for it.

508
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:47,850
Yeah, no, whatever.

509
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:50,770
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

510
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:53,930
Infinite, infinite, infinite.

511
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:55,370
Hulk's frozen.

512
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:57,290
Hulk low, Hulk low.

513
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:59,070
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

514
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:05,130
Stranger's so weak.

515
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:07,310
Bucky's low.

516
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:08,350
Nevermind, he's got heal.

517
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,530
Oh, you're in a room, you're in a room.

518
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:15,130
Hang on, I'm backing up, I'm backing up.

519
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:16,670
This is the last fight, last fight.

520
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,390
Use everything you have.

521
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,110
Lose everything.

522
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:19,770
This is the last fight.

523
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:22,550
Bucky low, Bucky low.

524
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,930
I'll have ult soon if we can stay, if we can stay.

525
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:26,710
Okay, I'm ulting, I'm ulting.

526
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:27,470
Yeah, just ult, just ult.

527
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:27,950
Use everything.

528
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:28,590
Last fight.

529
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,230
They're backline, they're backline, they're backline.

530
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:31,390
Oh no.

531
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:32,030
Are we on it?

532
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:32,630
We're on it, we're on it.

533
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:33,370
We're safe, we're safe, we're safe.

534
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,170
I'm backing up, I'm backing up.

535
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,610
Hulk low, Hulk, Hulk is low.

536
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,090
Strange ult, strange, strange, strange, strange.

537
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,210
I have ult here, I have ult here.

538
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:40,670
I'm using it.

539
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:44,830
I'm damage boosting it.

540
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,290
Back to support, heal.

541
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:49,310
Damage boosting again.

542
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:51,010
Oh no.

543
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:52,530
Winnable still.

544
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,310
Yeah, we're even, we're even.

545
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:56,610
Oh, we see nice.

546
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:57,190
Oh my god.

547
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:03,890
I'm not gonna lie, I was about to hit the absolute most obese ult of all time.

548
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,330
Like, they were all lined up and I had full juice.

549
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:07,150
That's what I did.

550
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:08,910
15.

551
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:13,150
Yeah, it's just like the...

552
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:17,390
Like the support ult in tandem, like charade back to back to back.

553
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:18,270
It's just kind of crazy.

554
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:20,890
It's a good push though.

555
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:21,590
Yeah.

556
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:25,430
I'll ult for a strange ult for us.

557
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:28,610
So like, if the strange comes in, you don't have to worry about it.

558
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,450
Guys, I don't know what to do.

559
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:35,610
Like, right now we should not be scared with the way we pushed and our results.

560
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:36,930
Like, this is actually good.

561
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:37,750
Let's not change anything.

562
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:38,410
Keep the formula.

563
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,810
And we just pressure tanks really hard.

564
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:41,830
See their tanks?

565
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:42,890
They're kind of doing like almost nothing.

566
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,890
Like, they're having a hard time.

567
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:45,710
We keep doing that.

568
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,330
Their Red Spurs are on tank.

569
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:48,790
Just bust the shields.

570
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:50,890
Make them like lose confidence.

571
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:51,330
You win this.

572
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:58,510
See, like I'm telling you, when you're breaking shield, like their strange, like he's doing nothing.

573
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,690
Like, he's out of tools, you know?

574
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,870
So, you know, maybe you feel useless.

575
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:03,390
You're not useless.

576
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:03,830
Breaking shield.

577
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:08,230
Mhm.

578
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:09,690
Real.

579
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:11,450
I'm telling you.

580
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:12,490
So real.

581
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:16,790
The guy was always hiding and then going to the corners because he can't stay main.

582
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:17,970
You're breaking shield.

583
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:24,870
Oh, alright.

584
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,920
Also, the Ironman Hulk team is not a strong team.

585
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:35,860
You don't have to be afraid.

586
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:41,350
Oh, I'm reloading.

587
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:42,710
I hear someone behind me.

588
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,630
Is that a Psylocke?

589
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:45,430
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

590
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,250
But she's back on main.

591
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:46,910
She's back on main.

592
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:49,190
Just let me know when you turn.

593
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:55,690
Nice, nice.

594
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:56,490
We're up one.

595
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:57,450
So don't be afraid.

596
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:58,570
Behind the...

597
00:21:58,570 --> 00:21:59,550
On the right, on the right.

598
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:00,210
Break that shit.

599
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:01,090
Break it, break it.

600
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:01,590
Thanks.

601
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:03,270
Infinite whenever you have it on this corner.

602
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:04,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

603
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:04,830
It's in.

604
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:05,230
I'm reloading.

605
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:05,570
I'm reloading.

606
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:07,290
I can't see you all.

607
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,490
I'm back, I'm back, I'm back.

608
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:10,530
I placed it.

609
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:12,990
No!

610
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:13,850
It's fine, you're fine.

611
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:14,750
You're safe, you're safe, you're safe.

612
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:16,190
Hulk on the right, Hulk on the right.

613
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:16,430
Behind.

614
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,670
On the cart, on the cart.

615
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:22,970
He's so weak.

616
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:24,690
I have ult.

617
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:26,610
Okay, back up a little bit.

618
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:27,870
I'm not fully defensible.

619
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:29,390
Okay, stay alive, stay alive, stay alive.

620
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:30,930
Don't panic, don't panic.

621
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:32,150
Stay together.

622
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:33,570
Back up a little to the right, to the right.

623
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:37,030
Okay, we need to retake, we need to retake.

624
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:37,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

625
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:38,910
I have to die here.

626
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:40,330
I can't live.

627
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:42,530
I tried to back away from that, I couldn't.

628
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:50,690
Hulk's pushed up.

629
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:51,910
I feel like we're winning this somehow.

630
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:57,310
When they push out, I can use ult right now on this Hulk.

631
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:58,990
Hulk's all the way in our backline.

632
00:22:59,010 --> 00:22:59,750
We should push early.

633
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,030
They have...

634
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:05,230
They have a lot of distance here.

635
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:06,310
Yeah, yeah.

636
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,110
I need heals.

637
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:07,850
Yeah, yeah.

638
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:11,450
Where do you want me to place it?

639
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,370
Like up here?

640
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:15,790
I froze him, I froze him, I froze him.

641
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:16,690
He has ult though.

642
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:21,230
Stranger's leash.

643
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:24,570
I'm saving my ult for a stranger ult, so Poki can ult whenever.

644
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:28,890
Hulk is literally one shot.

645
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:29,890
Hulk is one, Hulk is one.

646
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:32,010
Okay, I'm gonna come back with my ult.

647
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:41,110
That's fine, that's fine.

648
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:47,270
When she's done, I can use my ult.

649
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,730
We need to go back a little bit, we need to go back a little bit.

650
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:49,290
Yep.

651
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,510
Yeah, we need it like sooner.

652
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:52,390
I froze Hulk.

653
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:54,150
I'm gonna wait for her thing to go away.

654
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:57,610
I need it, I need it, I need it.

655
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:59,490
If you can keep me up, then...

656
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:00,970
Yeah, we need it, we need it, we need it, we need it now.

657
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:02,730
Like now, now, now, now, now.

658
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,710
I need heals, I need heals, I need heals.

659
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:04,670
I can't see you, I...

660
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:05,750
Yeah, I don't see you, I can't see you.

661
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:08,250
We see you now, we see you.

662
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:11,810
Strange one, strange one, strange half.

663
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:16,050
Nice, nice, nice.

664
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:18,350
Hulk's in that hallway.

665
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:19,770
We can get him, get him.

666
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:20,470
I froze him.

667
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:21,050
Oh, nice.

668
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:21,990
Stagger, stagger.

669
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:23,170
Don't kill him, don't kill him, don't kill him.

670
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:23,850
Stagger him, stagger him.

671
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:25,630
Just leave him, leave him.

672
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:29,230
Oh my god, he was literally the one.

673
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:30,010
Holy shit.

674
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:30,890
What the fuck?

675
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:33,050
There's kills if you have...

676
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:36,450
Yeah, push up more, push up more.

677
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:37,010
Get out, get out.

678
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:37,650
Back up a bit.

679
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:38,610
We need to back up a bit.

680
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:42,850
Good job, guys.

681
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:44,710
Portal, portal, portal, portal.

682
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,330
Yeah, yeah, yeah, down the corner, corner, here, right here.

683
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:47,350
Right here, right here.

684
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:48,110
Together, together.

685
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:51,250
Uh, I don't have relay yet.

686
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:52,430
I got it.

687
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,070
Don't worry.

688
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:53,670
Nice, nice, nice.

689
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:54,890
Good ult.

690
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:57,830
I'm damage boosting.

691
00:24:59,190 --> 00:24:59,970
Should I ult?

692
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:01,330
There's Psylocke on the backline.

693
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:03,210
On the cart.

694
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:04,950
Stay healthy.

695
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:07,170
Come back a bit.

696
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:07,790
Punisher, yep.

697
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,130
Ult here, ult here, ult here.

698
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:12,250
I'm ulting.

699
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:14,190
I'm on Hulk.

700
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:14,850
Hulk die, Hulk die.

701
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:15,830
No!

702
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:19,830
And he reloaded.

703
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:23,410
There's a Hulk in our backlines.

704
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:27,050
Oh my god, Hulk is literally one in the back.

705
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:29,170
I can't do anything.

706
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:30,950
It's just you and I.

707
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:36,810
Oh, I'm running back.

708
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:41,880
Dang it.

709
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,780
We still have one more map here.

710
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,600
It's best of three.

711
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:45,880
Oh my god.

712
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,720
I think it's just two games, no?

713
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,460
Yeah, it's two games.

714
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:51,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

715
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,500
At the end of the day, this game is a lot closer than it looks.

716
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,500
It's not...

717
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,160
Like, we're doing really good.

718
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,980
I do think the combination...

719
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,200
The Gamma, Gamma's ruling us.

720
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:03,660
I'm not kidding.

721
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,500
Just the fact that they have Hulk is...

722
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:08,240
Like, it's not that the Hulk is killing us.

723
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,400
It's that they have Hulk.

724
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:09,900
Does that make sense?

725
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,540
Because Gamma is very strong.

726
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,260
Yeah.

727
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,300
Did he play Strange?

728
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:18,480
And Hulk?

729
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:21,180
Yeah, because SageM's a Strange player.

730
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,720
The MvC4, he's a Strange player.

731
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:26,660
Or Strange main.

732
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,080
Oh, they have...

733
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,560
So we could ban Strange.

734
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,880
I would like to ban Strange.

735
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,600
And then they'll both be Strange players, technically.

736
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,280
Yeah.

737
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,820
But they're just gonna protect Hulk for Bulger.

738
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,960
Because he plays Hulk for his team, too.

739
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,960
See, we have a lot of damage.

740
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,280
Like, we're not doing bad.

741
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,460
It's just...

742
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:48,500
Oh.

743
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,480
I said that in team chat.

744
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,180
Someone will tell him.

745
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,000
Word will get back around.

746
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:14,170
Guys, I will perform better, okay?

747
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:15,790
No, you did great!

748
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:18,930
We're going to dress the elephant in the room, okay?

749
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:20,210
No, I don't...

750
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:21,570
I don't even think it was your fault.

751
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:22,370
I think it was...

752
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:24,010
I don't think I was very...

753
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:24,770
Listen, I'm not kidding.

754
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:25,610
You had pretty good damage.

755
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:27,350
That's really, really good, yeah.

756
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:30,170
It's just about, like...

757
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:31,350
In the end, they're gonna have to support ults.

758
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:32,230
Because they have three support ults.

759
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:33,130
And we have two.

760
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:35,750
Because Raccoon's ult is then, like, a real ult, right?

761
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:39,410
Right, right.

762
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:40,210
That's great.

763
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:45,030
I can play Mantis.

764
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:49,090
Yeah, Mantis works.

765
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:53,010
If we do triple support, Mantis is, like, one of the best for trip support.

766
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:55,110
Just because, like, of the speed boost.

767
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:56,290
Yeah.

768
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,080
It really is, like, whatever you're comfortable.

769
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,120
I can play any other support.

770
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,240
So, I can flex anything you guys are comfortable with.

771
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,720
I think they're doing good right now.

772
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,220
That we're not doing is that...

773
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,800
They're, like, backing and stabilizing.

774
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,420
When they're, like, down by one.

775
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,280
Or, like...

776
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,320
We use a certain ult.

777
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,600
We need to be able to do something.

778
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,400
Like, whenever they use a support ult like that...

779
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,740
We have to, like, back out of it.

780
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,920
And everybody gets out.

781
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,320
So, now we're in a bit of a de-sync.

782
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,920
Like, we have, like, two groups right now.

783
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,620
We need to be one group.

784
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,700
We need to get out of their ult.

785
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,920
And just keep going backwards.

786
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:27,760
And just stabilize our HP.

787
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:30,620
Yeah.

788
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,200
Sounds good.

789
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:36,020
We can stabilize more frequently.

790
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,640
Not me, personally.

791
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,940
I think that was a fluke.

792
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,600
It doesn't fucking matter what we do.

793
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,120
It'll be fine.

794
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:44,980
We win this.

795
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,200
No, if that was caught, like, uh...

796
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,160
Domination, we win this, by the way.

797
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,320
Listen, there's little things.

798
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:50,820
Sure.

799
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:53,880
But, really, it's because they had Strange and Bruce...

800
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,300
...at the same fucking time.

801
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,040
That's the only reason.

802
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,020
They have two tank players.

803
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,240
How could this be?

804
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,060
And they got both of the most fucking annoying tanks.

805
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,480
And they ban me?

806
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,560
Little ol' me on little ol' Penny?

807
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:10,420
Yeah, like, do they really need more?

808
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,900
How could you nerf us more?

809
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,340
You're on Penny!

810
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,560
I can't believe...

811
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,880
They're just afraid of your Penny, Poki.

812
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:22,960
They're so afraid.

813
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:24,180
What?

814
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,900
They were like, her Penny is the game changer.

815
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,040
Like, it would've been, like, an easy 1-0.

816
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,920
I just can't believe them.

817
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:32,680
Yeah, this time, I think we...

818
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,180
I thought we were friends.

819
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:38,380
We ban Strange, save Penny, and our win rate goes up, like, 90%.

820
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,140
Yeah, exactly.

821
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,080
We gotta do that.

822
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,020
And then they ban Penny first.

823
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,080
If they ban Penny first, they're that afraid of you.

824
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:45,980
That should be an honor.

825
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,120
I agree.

826
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,640
You got one above all player to ban Penny.

827
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,300
Then we get Groot, so it's okay.

828
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:53,880
Yeah.

829
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:01,450
Which hero do you think you want to be today?

830
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:07,610
This...

831
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:10,150
By the way, Challa is really good for Penny, so...

832
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:11,070
Girl, I know.

833
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:13,450
Let's get it!

834
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:15,210
You're like, this ain't my first video.

835
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:15,910
I hope I get it.

836
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:18,990
Is the whole tournament, is it all Convoy?

837
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:21,010
No, you get to pick them out.

838
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:22,270
Yeah, yeah, I pick Challa.

839
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:23,050
I pick Challa for us.

840
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:24,650
Convoy is, like, the best.

841
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:25,410
It's so fun.

842
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:25,950
I love it.

843
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:27,910
Yeah, I'm looking for fun right now.

844
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:28,590
I'm trying to win the game.

845
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:34,390
Those 47 skins are so... guys, guys.

846
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:35,290
Those add up, guys.

847
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:36,710
I'm not gonna lie, I do really want that.

848
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:37,630
I do, I do.

849
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:38,770
You see the wonder of life.

850
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:40,370
Wait, they didn't ban anybody.

851
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:41,510
Oh, gosh.

852
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:42,070
They messed up the ban.

853
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:42,730
Oh my gosh!

854
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:43,710
Good for us.

855
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:45,810
We getting strange out of here.

856
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:48,550
I think we ban Strange.

857
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:49,330
Yeah, we ban Strange.

858
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:51,650
That's super one special right there.

859
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:52,190
No.

860
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:54,490
Exactly.

861
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:55,290
Me.

862
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:01,010
Very saving.

863
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:01,830
Will decide.

864
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:02,470
Can I save Penny?

865
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:04,890
Yeah, save Penny.

866
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:05,470
Dang.

867
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:05,870
Yay!

868
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:09,170
Let's have a good time.

869
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,380
Okay, so I guess we're gonna run double support then.

870
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:20,220
And we're gonna... if Hoagie's gonna be on Penny.

871
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,900
I don't even know why they're saving Hoagie.

872
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:26,100
Cringe.

873
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,200
It doesn't even make any sense yet.

874
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:27,620
I don't know.

875
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:28,260
Cringe.

876
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:29,680
I guess...

877
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,480
Then I think I'm just gonna ban Mag then.

878
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,960
Yeah, just ban Mag.

879
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,440
Let them not run normal comp.

880
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,020
Yeah, they have no tank.

881
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,240
They have no tank to play now.

882
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:45,140
I don't know who they'll play with.

883
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,060
This is fine.

884
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,040
I'm okay with this.

885
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,640
Wait, do you play Cloak and Dagger or Luna?

886
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,440
I can play Luna.

887
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:55,700
Yeah, okay.

888
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,080
I'll play... you can play Irelia, whichever is your best.

889
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,400
Because Mantis is not as great for duo support anymore.

890
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,440
I can play Cloak.

891
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:03,940
Okay.

892
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:13,500
Do you want me... I can do Moon Knight or Punisher or Namor.

893
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,260
Maybe Moon Knight on this one?

894
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:19,720
Are we defense?

895
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,340
Oh, okay, it's Coff.

896
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:21,760
Yeah, right.

897
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,120
Oh, no.

898
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:35,660
This is like the most off meta stuff I've ever played, so I don't know what goes well.

899
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,200
What am I doing?

900
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,460
I'm just like, I'm looking at my T as like...

901
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:42,240
I don't know what goes well with this team.

902
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,580
Feel free to suggest whatever you'd like.

903
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:48,140
Do you guys want to go straight side or do you want to fight up top?

904
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,140
I think we...

905
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,480
Also, Dokkae next, you guys should definitely like over communicate.

906
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:57,780
Yeah, yeah.

907
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:58,900
Don't ever shut up.

908
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:04,460
Go right, yeah, go right, like under, under and then we meet them like an L shape.

909
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,500
I don't want to go in, I don't want to go in.

910
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,080
Just go here.

911
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,480
I'm right behind you guys.

912
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,680
Just follow, just follow XTC.

913
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,080
I'm up.

914
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:17,760
I'm psyched.

915
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:25,850
Jesus Christ, you take so much damage.

916
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:26,590
That's fine.

917
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:30,190
Nice.

918
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:34,590
I froze him, I froze him, I froze him.

919
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:38,830
Reloading.

920
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:39,990
Got you.

921
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:41,430
Okay.

922
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:42,310
Oh, nice!

923
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:45,450
Okay, Senna!

924
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:48,370
Oh, thanks guys, A team.

925
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:52,550
Guys, I feel like...

926
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:54,130
I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see.

927
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:55,270
...or something.

928
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,530
It's okay, it's okay, back up, back up.

929
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:00,530
You guys are okay numbers though.

930
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,490
I froze him, I froze him.

931
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:01,950
Just kill him.

932
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:03,510
Senna's one.

933
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:04,110
Five, five, five.

934
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:04,690
Massive.

935
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:08,730
They only have rocket, they only have rocket, they only have rocket.

936
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:10,090
Nice.

937
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:12,170
Senna's low.

938
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:13,310
He's hard.

939
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:13,930
I need it.

940
00:34:13,930 --> 00:34:15,110
I need a heal.

941
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:17,850
You're fine, you're fine, you're fine, you're fine, you're fine.

942
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:18,730
Good job, guys.

943
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:22,090
There are only a few users in the back.

944
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:23,350
Oh, nice.

945
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:24,870
Oh my god.

946
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:25,570
Jeez, jeez.

947
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:26,670
Nice.

948
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:28,490
Good job.

949
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:30,330
What do we have coming up?

950
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:31,410
We have a slow Colt.

951
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:34,730
You'll Colt first.

952
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:36,050
Yeah, I got it, I got it.

953
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:37,010
Just stay in the blue.

954
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:37,930
That's all you need to know.

955
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:38,430
Just stay in the blue.

956
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:39,130
Super important.

957
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:40,990
They can't one tap him.

958
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:42,230
Let's see.

959
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:44,010
Oh, they're in trip support.

960
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:45,770
Yeah.

961
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:47,930
Okay, Colt first, Colt first.

962
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:50,390
We can use it defensively, just use it defensively.

963
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:50,590
Okay.

964
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:52,270
Like, against Bucky?

965
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,170
I'll do it for...

966
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:55,350
I'll do it after you.

967
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:55,770
Okay.

968
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:58,050
Oh, I missed my Q's.

969
00:34:59,070 --> 00:34:59,910
I'm on hulk, I'm on hulk.

970
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:04,350
Ooh, ooh, I had a backup.

971
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:05,650
Or counter this one if you want to.

972
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:06,610
Counter this, counter this.

973
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:06,950
Thank you.

974
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:08,030
I'm gonna counter, I'm gonna counter.

975
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:08,750
Yeah, counter this.

976
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,190
I'm gonna die.

977
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:13,190
Oh, I got clapped.

978
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:14,530
Yeah.

979
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:17,430
I'm gonna try to just ult on the cloak ult.

980
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:18,350
On ours?

981
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:19,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

982
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:20,010
As long as I can.

983
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:21,710
Just get out, get out, get out.

984
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:24,170
Just don't use anything.

985
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:25,290
If possible.

986
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:27,450
Okay, I'll try to just get out.

987
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:31,190
They used like, two ults for that.

988
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:32,050
Ooh.

989
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:32,830
They used three ults.

990
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:33,930
I think it's everything.

991
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:34,970
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

992
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:36,110
We just have to retake one.

993
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:40,330
Oh, got you on him.

994
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:43,170
I can keep you up.

995
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:43,830
I can save you.

996
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:46,370
Wait, Bucky, Bucky, Bucky.

997
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:46,750
Focus Bucky.

998
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:47,970
This guy is just throwing, yeah.

999
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:50,370
Rocket one.

1000
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:50,790
Slow them.

1001
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:52,310
No, I'm trying to hit the rocket.

1002
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:55,490
I froze him, I froze him.

1003
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:00,190
He's stunned.

1004
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:00,710
Nice, nice.

1005
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,590
I'm gonna ult down this and throw over here.

1006
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:07,900
That's huge, that's huge.

1007
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:08,940
Focus Hulk if you can.

1008
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:09,620
Burn if you only can.

1009
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,640
Hulk half, Hulk half.

1010
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,300
Yeah, let's go to point.

1011
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,220
Let's go point, yeah.

1012
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,580
Hulk is half.

1013
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,060
Holding this.

1014
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,080
No!

1015
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,340
Thor should be blinded.

1016
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,080
Thor half.

1017
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:21,580
Thor half.

1018
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,100
Thor, Thor, Thor, Thor, Thor.

1019
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:23,400
We're dead.

1020
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,760
Okay, guys, we just have to...

1021
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,840
Nice, good job, guys.

1022
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:28,860
Healers, healers.

1023
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:29,980
No, no, no, no.

1024
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,780
Hulk's on point, Hulk's on point.

1025
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,840
I got my point again.

1026
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:37,740
Yeah, yeah.

1027
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,940
We can play around Luno.

1028
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,000
Just be around me.

1029
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:42,880
Stun Thor.

1030
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,800
Oh, no, I can't get to you.

1031
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:44,960
I'm here.

1032
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,060
Not even.

1033
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,180
I froze Hulk, I froze Hulk.

1034
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,660
I tried, I tried to get Rocket Hulk.

1035
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,920
We still have point, we still have point.

1036
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:53,660
Just stay on point.

1037
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,880
Dang, on point.

1038
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:57,620
Bucky low, Bucky low.

1039
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,700
Show low, I'm ulting.

1040
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,300
Oh, can't see.

1041
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:01,800
Shielding you.

1042
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,620
Yeah, I'm going outside of it.

1043
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,360
She's low.

1044
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:06,140
Not anymore.

1045
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:07,420
Oh, shoot.

1046
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,060
I'm sorry.

1047
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:09,860
Oh, I couldn't.

1048
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,000
They used ult, they used ult.

1049
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:11,860
Just don't use anything.

1050
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,520
I don't think...

1051
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,660
We've lost both supports.

1052
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:18,800
This is awkward.

1053
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,500
Are we... are we committing to this?

1054
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,740
We don't, you don't have support.

1055
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,400
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1056
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,220
Oh, actually?

1057
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,880
Oh, yeah, commit, commit, commit, commit, commit, commit.

1058
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,280
Use, use, use, use, use.

1059
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:28,520
What?

1060
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,620
What are you...

1061
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,460
Oh, man.

1062
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,140
Commit, commit to this, commit to this, commit to this.

1063
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:34,940
Don't leave her, don't leave her.

1064
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:35,760
Coming back, coming back, coming back.

1065
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,700
Don't leave her, don't leave her.

1066
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,120
Coming back.

1067
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:38,900
I'm running back.

1068
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:43,260
Just stay on my egg, stay on my egg.

1069
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:43,940
Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead.

1070
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,300
I got baby hulk.

1071
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,520
Okay, nice.

1072
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,780
Let's go.

1073
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:49,920
Let's just get them all.

1074
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,320
Rocket, rocket, rocket, kill him.

1075
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,840
Just don't let him touch it.

1076
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:54,000
Oh.

1077
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:54,600
Nice.

1078
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,620
Good job.

1079
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,020
Go.

1080
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:04,650
Okay, well, I think we keep doing the same thing.

1081
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:09,630
Since, like, I'm kind of running solo tank over there, I'm gonna need a lot of heals, but it's working, right?

1082
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:13,070
Yeah, yeah, I gave you the snowflake, so you should be invincible.

1083
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:16,030
We start with ult, too, and I have it, so...

1084
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:17,730
Good job, Lulu.

1085
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:18,710
Thanks.

1086
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:22,950
We could aggressively cloak ult this if needed.

1087
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:24,430
Yeah.

1088
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:30,930
I'm sorry, my first cloak ult was really bad.

1089
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:35,190
That's okay, like, we didn't expect the thor to ult us off of the cloak ult.

1090
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:39,010
Yeah, or I should have just stacked on top of each other.

1091
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:40,930
I was, like, doing, like, a four square.

1092
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:49,050
This is really, by the way, like, as long as we choke them in, right, and they can't go wide, we just spam the corners.

1093
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:51,750
It's, like, crazy with this combo with the B.S.A.

1094
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:55,430
Like, like, Squirrel and Moon is, like, crazy.

1095
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:00,190
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1096
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:01,770
Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.

1097
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:04,330
Are we going straight fight?

1098
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:05,650
No, no, no, right there.

1099
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:08,490
Just go where XPC is.

1100
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:09,900
You're really all...

1101
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:15,650
I'm trying to keep you up so you can stay...

1102
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:16,950
That's good.

1103
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:19,650
Nice.

1104
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:20,550
I actually died.

1105
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:25,550
We can win this, technically.

1106
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:27,650
They burnt two ults, they burnt two ults.

1107
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:28,430
Oh, yeah, that's true.

1108
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:29,630
I froze him.

1109
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:35,770
Luna?

1110
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:38,110
Luna's half, but...

1111
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:38,850
Yeah, she was so far.

1112
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:39,890
Thor is low, too.

1113
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:42,250
When everyone's back, I can ult.

1114
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:43,250
We're all back, we're all back.

1115
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:45,570
We're all back, we're all back.

1116
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:46,870
I'm almost up top.

1117
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:48,450
You can ult aggressively, too.

1118
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:51,130
We're ulting aggressively on point.

1119
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:53,130
Showdown, showdown, showdown, one more.

1120
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:55,910
Hey, Luna ulted.

1121
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:58,530
Leon, cloak all you needed.

1122
00:39:59,010 --> 00:39:59,330
Nice.

1123
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:02,010
Let's get point, get Bruce, get Bruce, get Bruce.

1124
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:03,690
Frozen, frozen, frozen, frozen.

1125
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:05,490
Luna's gonna be alone in, like, five seconds.

1126
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:07,150
Drop down to me.

1127
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:09,670
Better stun, stun, stun Luna, stun Luna, stun Luna.

1128
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:10,810
Luna dead, Luna dead.

1129
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:12,430
No, she's behind, and now she is.

1130
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:15,750
Nice, I got you.

1131
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:16,270
Nice.

1132
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:18,270
Thor on point.

1133
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:19,350
Get Thor, get Thor, get Thor.

1134
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:21,210
Oh, sorry, Thor, Thor, Thor, Thor.

1135
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:22,730
Thor, Thor, Thor, Thor, Thor.

1136
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:23,830
Thor, Thor, Thor, Thor, Thor.

1137
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:25,610
I froze him, too, I froze him.

1138
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:27,390
Nice.

1139
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:32,290
I don't have another freeze, so if he jumps in, I can't do it.

1140
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:34,570
He's jumping in.

1141
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:35,970
Oh, my God, this freaking...

1142
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:36,930
I'mma do it, I'mma do it, I'mma do it, I'mma do it.

1143
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:38,750
I got you, I got you, I got you, I got you, I got you.

1144
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:39,770
Nice, thank you.

1145
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:41,250
All their squishies are on the left.

1146
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:45,890
I kinda had to do that to get...

1147
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:46,850
Heal, heal, heal, heal, heal, heal.

1148
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:48,250
I had to reload, I had to reload.

1149
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:49,910
I was hitting, sorry.

1150
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:51,230
No, you're good.

1151
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:52,630
Oh, can we come on point again?

1152
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:53,130
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1153
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:54,750
Yeah, he's mini, he's mini.

1154
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:56,610
Nice, nice.

1155
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:58,010
We lost our King, though.

1156
00:40:58,310 --> 00:40:59,310
I'm here if we need to.

1157
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:01,810
Him, too.

1158
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:02,470
Oh, back up.

1159
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:04,590
Punishable.

1160
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:05,450
Oh...

1161
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:09,010
It's just you, Poki.

1162
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:11,010
Just stall as long as you can, if you...

1163
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:11,450
Just stall.

1164
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:14,790
Just keep stalling, just keep stalling.

1165
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:16,210
Our Hulk's coming back, just stay on point.

1166
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:17,730
Our Hulk is coming back.

1167
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:18,710
I can't recontest that.

1168
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:20,050
That's fine, that's fine.

1169
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:22,550
Oh...

1170
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:23,030
It's alright.

1171
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:24,890
I can't give you an orb, excuse you.

1172
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:27,030
Yeah, I'm good here.

1173
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:29,810
Yeah, you got orb, you got orb.

1174
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:31,250
I'm frozen.

1175
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:32,870
Yep, yep, yep.

1176
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:36,090
I'mma go up top so I have an angle on them.

1177
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:36,970
Okay.

1178
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:38,250
Yeah, I mean, they know that I'm playing main.

1179
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:39,090
They're playing way back now.

1180
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:40,090
They're scaring me a little bit.

1181
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:42,850
You guys ready?

1182
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:44,110
Yeah.

1183
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:44,810
We're all here, we're all here.

1184
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:47,430
You can cloak up first and meet it.

1185
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:48,610
I'll do second ult.

1186
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:48,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1187
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:50,010
I'm ulting.

1188
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:52,030
I'm diving.

1189
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:55,310
I'm on...

1190
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:56,390
Thor, Thor half, Thor half.

1191
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:56,630
Okay.

1192
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:57,530
Okay.

1193
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:58,430
Just play on...

1194
00:41:58,430 --> 00:41:59,410
Play on cloak, I'll meet it.

1195
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:03,470
Why am I...

1196
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:05,670
I'm floating on the anti-grav.

1197
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:07,430
Oh my gosh, are you kidding me?

1198
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,750
I have to use this.

1199
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:16,790
I'm on point if he heals me.

1200
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:20,210
This is last fight, this is last fight.

1201
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:20,990
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1202
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:23,070
I'm damage boosting now.

1203
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:26,790
I froze him.

1204
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:35,290
No, I'm frozen, I'm frozen.

1205
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:38,210
I have to reload.

1206
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:40,210
Oh my god, you gotta be kidding me.

1207
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:41,150
He hit me right when I...

1208
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:42,070
Luna's so weak.

1209
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:43,150
I'm on Luna.

1210
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:44,390
Nope, she ulted.

1211
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:47,850
If you guys can hold, I'll be back in five.

1212
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:49,330
I'm trying.

1213
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:50,750
Just don't get off point.

1214
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:51,530
This is not my map.

1215
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:51,950
I died.

1216
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:52,650
Not my...

1217
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:53,670
Do we stop healing?

1218
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:54,950
It's just me.

1219
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:55,990
It's just me and xQc.

1220
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:57,250
But I'm gonna die here.

1221
00:42:57,370 --> 00:42:58,430
They can die here, they can die here.

1222
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:06,510
I hate this map so much.

1223
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:10,950
Dude, I got stuck in the anti-grav thing.

1224
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:13,530
My bad, I was yapping but I was muted.

1225
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:14,430
Oh no.

1226
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:18,570
I was saying like, yeah, a lot of those squishies were just chilling alone in the back line.

1227
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:23,610
I think if we just focused them or called who to focus, I think we would have won that OT moment.

1228
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:25,470
I mean, yeah.

1229
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:28,410
Squirtle's also tough on the second too, so.

1230
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:31,830
I also think the squids need to die faster.

1231
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:34,570
Yes, I agree.

1232
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:35,590
This map is a lot harder for us.

1233
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:38,570
It's a lot harder because we're running like AoE DPS, whatever, and there's no chokes there.

1234
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:39,370
It's like all wide open.

1235
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:41,390
We run the same thing, I think we're chilling.

1236
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:43,730
I can go...

1237
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:44,390
I could...

1238
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:47,890
I could play Psylocke if...

1239
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:50,390
I could play Psylocke if someone wants to play Luna.

1240
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:52,830
Is there anybody I should switch to?

1241
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:54,470
No...

1242
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:55,170
Shut up, Senna.

1243
00:43:56,830 --> 00:43:58,990
Guys, we won the first map because we're holding...

1244
00:43:58,990 --> 00:43:59,630
I don't know, Senna.

1245
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:01,150
Is there anyone you could switch to?

1246
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:02,750
Senna, are you doing good?

1247
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:06,730
No, girl, you're good.

1248
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:09,450
I really think if you guys want to swap, go ahead.

1249
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:11,850
Don't worry, team, you've got this.

1250
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:13,580
Go in, go in, go in, go in, go in, go in, go in.

1251
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:15,750
Wait, what?

1252
00:44:16,330 --> 00:44:18,510
It's left, it's actually left, it's left.

1253
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:25,610
It's okay, some people don't know they're left and right.

1254
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:26,410
That's okay.

1255
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:29,870
Kill those tentacles ASAP.

1256
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:31,590
Any heals, any heals?

1257
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:32,590
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1258
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:33,430
Yeah, dude.

1259
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:37,770
I would like to set up closer to point, if anyone doesn't mind.

1260
00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:39,430
We're down, Hulk, though, so...

1261
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:41,750
You can...

1262
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:43,030
Okay, then I might have to back up.

1263
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:45,970
Oh my god, they're holding me down!

1264
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:49,330
Dude, that fucking Hulk is so annoying.

1265
00:44:49,610 --> 00:44:52,170
Do we want to go to point, or what do we want to do here?

1266
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:56,230
I think we go point.

1267
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:01,540
I have ult.

1268
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:04,060
I have ult too, I'm gonna...

1269
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:05,860
To the left, Luna left, Luna left!

1270
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:06,400
Luna!

1271
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:07,940
Any heals, any heals?

1272
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:08,840
Oh shit!

1273
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,240
No, he's just punching me in the face!

1274
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:13,020
It's not your fault, I was isolated.

1275
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,520
We're down too, so we should just chill.

1276
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:18,600
I think I'm gonna ult and switch.

1277
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:21,300
We could run trip support, because they're running trip support.

1278
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:22,220
If you guys want to swap it.

1279
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:24,660
He's low here.

1280
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:29,560
I'm down, I used my ult again.

1281
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:31,960
Alright, I have to ult this, Rose.

1282
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:34,680
You can push with this if needed.

1283
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:36,320
I'm damaged.

1284
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:38,380
I'm gonna save our supports real fast.

1285
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:41,360
I'm just getting peeled like crazy right now.

1286
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:46,820
I'm swapping, I'm swapping.

1287
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:49,600
You're good, you're good.

1288
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:54,540
I'm ulting off to site.

1289
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:58,420
Froze storm.

1290
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:00,400
Just play on site, play on site!

1291
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:01,080
Luna one!

1292
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:02,540
They're so low, they're so low.

1293
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,200
Luna one!

1294
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:16,140
I'm on you, I'm trying to save you.

1295
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:16,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1296
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,000
This is last fight.

1297
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:19,960
Thor one, Thor one!

1298
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:21,660
Focus Thor if you can.

1299
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:28,430
I got you.

1300
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:30,670
I don't got you after that.

1301
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:33,370
I hate the fact that I don't got you.

1302
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:35,210
I froze him.

1303
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:36,670
But I might be dead.

1304
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:38,870
I'm gonna be dead here for the Thor.

1305
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:41,110
If someone protects me, we can win this.

1306
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:43,070
Someone protects me, we can win this.

1307
00:46:57,660 --> 00:46:58,420
Triple support.

1308
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:00,340
Yeah, triple support crunch is disgusting.

1309
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:00,880
Jesus.

1310
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:08,910
That's just not even fun to be honest with you.

1311
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:12,870
I don't even know why they're forcing that comp, it's just so boring.

1312
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:16,670
I think it's because they also have like three support players.

1313
00:47:18,350 --> 00:47:20,370
So they just put them on what they're comfortable in.

1314
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:26,320
Volker really, really wants the skins.

1315
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:29,040
Oops.

1316
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:31,940
It's so hard to get anything to die once they got triple support.

1317
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:35,480
Yeah, I think like the only way to counter it was just to run our own triple support.

1318
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:37,140
Yeah.

1319
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:42,060
I mean there is ways to counter it without running it, but that's like a lot of coordination.

1320
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:50,900
Oh my god.

1321
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:51,740
I mean like...

1322
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:55,960
Do we have to commit to five rounds?

1323
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:58,080
They have two tank slayers, so...

1324
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:00,220
Are you kidding me?

1325
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:08,640
I mean I was willing to swap to DPS, but also like, you know, I want everyone to play what they're comfortable with.

1326
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:09,840
Every two games, yeah.

1327
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,120
And we're ranked individually?

1328
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:16,500
Yo, I'm not gonna... I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say.

1329
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:19,680
This matchup was imbalanced and there was a rating for us, right?

1330
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:23,420
And we still made it to close, and they had to resolve down to triple support to win the game.

1331
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:25,080
We won in my heart.

1332
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:25,920
That would be kind of true.

1333
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:26,740
True.

1334
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:35,580
Did somebody say XQC stats?

1335
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:38,180
Six kills and five complaints.

1336
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:39,820
Oh my god.

1337
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,020
Not wrong.

1338
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,900
I don't know why my Discord overlay is not working, chat.

1339
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:47,180
It's like...

1340
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:49,960
Are we just... do we just go back to the chat call?

1341
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:50,700
I don't know.

1342
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:53,040
I think we just wait.

1343
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:57,440
Until the other games... I think the other games are still going on, so we're just waiting.

1344
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:02,800
What was I gonna say?

1345
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:04,460
Magnary Strike?

1346
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:04,840
Maybe.

1347
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:08,240
My Discord's not regis... like it won't let me...

1348
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,580
It keeps saying my... it can't connect to my Discord live.

1349
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:10,400
Do we just wait here?

1350
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:11,720
Can we run practice ones or no?

1351
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:14,180
Wait, what do you mean?

1352
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:16,940
Are we allowed to play practice games or no?

1353
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:17,660
Well...

1354
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:21,080
If you leave a quick play match, it gives you a penalty too.

1355
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:23,360
Wait, what?

1356
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:24,100
It does?

1357
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:24,960
I'm pretty sure.

1358
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:26,680
I'm pretty sure.

1359
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:29,820
I don't know if they patched that, but it was in the last season.

1360
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:34,280
And like you don't know when... you don't know when the other games end too.

1361
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:39,880
But yeah...

1362
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,860
Oh, my chat's saying now you wanna practice.

1363
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:46,620
So what?

1364
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:48,240
Like, do you really need practice before these?

1365
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:48,900
It's fine.

1366
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:52,240
I mean, this is... just use this as practice.

1367
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:59,920
And now the rest of them will excel and we'll all do really fucking good.

1368
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,500
Apparently you can leave two in a row and you should be fine.

1369
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:07,000
If you leave two in a row, then they'll give you a penalty, so you could just do a quick play.

1370
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,120
When is the next matchup?

1371
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:09,420
Do you guys know?

1372
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,860
I think we're just waiting for all the other games to end before we move on.

1373
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:15,760
Oh, all of them have to end.

1374
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:17,520
Maybe.

1375
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:19,720
I don't know.

1376
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:22,900
Toast is literally here, so we could just ask him.

1377
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,240
He's literally in our lobby.

1378
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:32,370
But yeah, no...

1379
00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:33,650
Are they close to finishing or not?

1380
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:37,330
But yeah, no...

1381
00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:44,770
I was willing to swap if needed, but I also wanted everyone to play the role they were comfortable in.

1382
00:50:45,190 --> 00:50:46,210
But I was not playing tank.

1383
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:47,210
I would never play tank.

1384
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:52,550
I would rather play DPS than tank.

1385
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:54,330
That's what I was like thinking when they ran triple support.

1386
00:50:54,550 --> 00:50:58,190
I thought about playing Psylocke just to see if I could get one of their supports down.

1387
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:03,650
Wait, shrouds in this tournament?

1388
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:05,190
I was like thinking about it.

1389
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:08,010
I was doomed from the start.

1390
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:11,570
What the fuck is that shit, bro?

1391
00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:13,750
I'm going against fucking shroud?

1392
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:16,410
I know I could out DPS...

1393
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:18,050
Shroud in any of your matches?

1394
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:18,370
Shoto.

1395
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:19,330
I'm sorry, Shoto.

1396
00:51:19,770 --> 00:51:22,190
I have no idea, but if it's ranked individually...

1397
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:25,670
I think this is like a make-a-wish thing.

1398
00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:28,330
I was like, I know I could out DPS Shoto.

1399
00:51:28,330 --> 00:51:30,590
Yeah, all these trash ass players, I'll just throw them on you.

1400
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:32,370
From DPS rate level wise.

1401
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:32,730
There's no way.

1402
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:38,950
I think XQC depended on my heals to keep him up because I had the shield flick on him.

1403
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:40,250
Which it might do.

1404
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:43,750
That's what I was worried about.

1405
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:49,870
My entire goal was just to make sure XQC lives as a support.

1406
00:51:50,910 --> 00:51:58,690
If I get off support, then I'm not sure if XQC will play as confident as he was.

1407
00:52:00,070 --> 00:52:02,070
And then he was playing way too confident there.

1408
00:52:02,070 --> 00:52:05,110
You have a snowflake, but it's not invincibility.

1409
00:52:08,850 --> 00:52:11,330
He played so confident there.

1410
00:52:18,550 --> 00:52:22,390
No, but he had a snowflake.

1411
00:52:22,590 --> 00:52:28,590
And Luna's heals can be really far from her.

1412
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:31,170
She can still heal you and stuff like that.

1413
00:52:31,170 --> 00:52:34,950
He played as if he had a second tank, but he did not.

1414
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:45,370
He just jumped in with six people burst firing him.

1415
00:52:45,510 --> 00:52:47,510
And I was just like, oh man, that's awkward.

1416
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:55,690
I try to freeze as much as I can.

1417
00:52:55,830 --> 00:52:59,790
I fumbled my freezes at first, but then my brain was fucking waking up.

1418
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:02,290
It got better.

1419
00:53:02,730 --> 00:53:05,970
My freezes got better later as we went on.

1420
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:11,170
And then I just didn't let the tanks have a good time there.

1421
00:53:13,910 --> 00:53:19,910
It's only after the second round I remembered how to do freezes and stuff.

1422
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:27,250
But no, it was a lot closer than I thought.

1423
00:53:27,530 --> 00:53:36,430
Because our team was a Squirrel Girl player, one tank, and then four support players.

1424
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:43,610
So honestly, we did really well for the team comp that we had.

1425
00:53:44,050 --> 00:53:46,090
I was just like, I don't know what's good, guys.

1426
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:49,670
I legitimately was like, should we play this?

1427
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:52,470
And I was just like, I don't know, I've never seen this comp before.

1428
00:53:58,150 --> 00:53:59,430
I don't know.

1429
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:01,750
This comp is weird as hell.

1430
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:03,750
If it works, it works.

1431
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:10,190
We should have just played triple support, though.

1432
00:54:11,330 --> 00:54:17,090
Because it's boring as fuck, but if the enemy team is going to play triple support, we might as well play triple support.

1433
00:54:17,290 --> 00:54:21,090
Oh my god, okay, let me show you guys something.

1434
00:54:22,930 --> 00:54:25,090
Let's see, let me show you my...

1435
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:29,970
Okay, these are custom games.

1436
00:54:30,090 --> 00:54:32,910
Okay, look, these don't matter because they're quick matches.

1437
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:36,750
It has such a nice-looking record, too.

1438
00:54:42,330 --> 00:54:44,270
Literally, right here, you can tell.

1439
00:54:44,270 --> 00:54:48,050
Like, I stopped here on the 24th.

1440
00:54:48,310 --> 00:54:50,810
Right here, this is when I stopped playing.

1441
00:54:53,050 --> 00:54:55,230
You're right, let me... there we go.

1442
00:54:55,350 --> 00:54:58,430
Now, okay, we don't talk... these three was cursed as fuck.

1443
00:54:58,530 --> 00:55:00,390
We also gotta scroll one trick here.

1444
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:06,150
But like, you can tell, right here is where I stopped playing because I was on vacation.

1445
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:09,270
I was on vacation.

1446
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:12,270
And then, on the 4th, I was like...

1447
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:14,190
Celestial won.

1448
00:55:14,890 --> 00:55:18,770
Okay, this was fucked up because I had five support players on my team.

1449
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:23,250
I literally had... I was already practicing for this tournament.

1450
00:55:23,870 --> 00:55:28,490
I was already practicing for this tournament.

1451
00:55:28,690 --> 00:55:32,830
This game was... my team had like five support mains.

1452
00:55:34,210 --> 00:55:39,490
And one of them locked in Rocket, was a Rocket one trick.

1453
00:55:39,870 --> 00:55:42,330
And he locked it in instantly.

1454
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:45,410
So we were like, what the fuck do we do?

1455
00:55:49,870 --> 00:55:51,870
So, yeah, no, no.

1456
00:55:52,510 --> 00:55:54,290
I have like a nice record here.

1457
00:55:54,370 --> 00:55:54,830
But yeah, no.

1458
00:55:56,350 --> 00:56:00,750
I had like some fucking... okay, I'll show you guys the screen.

1459
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:01,850
Okay, I was just...

1460
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:05,210
Okay, I'll show you guys.

1461
00:56:05,410 --> 00:56:08,510
I don't know why I was getting randomly flamed by people.

1462
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:10,150
But like, I won though.

1463
00:56:15,310 --> 00:56:16,490
Oh my god.

1464
00:56:16,590 --> 00:56:18,030
Okay, I'll show you guys this.

1465
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:21,130
My team...

1466
00:56:21,130 --> 00:56:23,830
Okay, so like, for one of the games I had...

1467
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:27,830
One of the games I had was...

1468
00:56:27,830 --> 00:56:28,790
Was...

1469
00:56:31,230 --> 00:56:34,170
I had this EU player on my team.

1470
00:56:34,590 --> 00:56:36,330
And I fucked up once.

1471
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:40,770
Where I accidentally stacked my support alt as Mantis.

1472
00:56:40,970 --> 00:56:42,810
With the invisible woman.

1473
00:56:43,310 --> 00:56:44,590
And I did it once.

1474
00:56:44,770 --> 00:56:46,050
We won the game.

1475
00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:48,150
But then I swapped to Loki.

1476
00:56:48,390 --> 00:56:50,850
And I saved us so many times.

1477
00:56:51,230 --> 00:56:52,750
Like for... because it was Koth.

1478
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:55,730
So then I saved us like so many times.

1479
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:57,010
Because I saved us from Magnetog.

1480
00:56:57,010 --> 00:56:59,550
I saved us from...

1481
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:02,750
I saved us from like so many different scenarios.

1482
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:03,730
And everything.

1483
00:57:04,510 --> 00:57:08,160
But then he hard focused on that one time.

1484
00:57:08,790 --> 00:57:10,310
That I doubled...

1485
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,970
I like stacked his alt.

1486
00:57:13,370 --> 00:57:14,390
And then like...

1487
00:57:14,390 --> 00:57:16,250
And then we got against him.

1488
00:57:17,010 --> 00:57:17,870
The next time.

1489
00:57:17,990 --> 00:57:18,990
Like an hour later.

1490
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:20,220
And then he...

1491
00:57:20,810 --> 00:57:23,250
And then my team won against him.

1492
00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:24,330
And then...

1493
00:57:24,330 --> 00:57:25,830
And then he said this.

1494
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:38,200
I was just like...

1495
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,300
I was healing.

1496
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:47,480
Oh my god.

1497
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:51,380
And then...

1498
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:54,540
And then like I was playing.

1499
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:56,400
I was playing with someone.

1500
00:57:56,860 --> 00:57:57,900
And they were on...

1501
00:57:57,900 --> 00:57:59,120
Like they were on their mains.

1502
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:00,280
But their alt account was like...

1503
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:03,040
Was higher ranked than their main account.

1504
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:03,800
And...

1505
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:04,800
Dude.

1506
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:06,580
So I was like...

1507
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:08,720
What the fuck are you talking about?

1508
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:11,860
Like...

1509
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:13,660
And like...

1510
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:14,980
I needed you to know.

1511
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:15,480
Okay.

1512
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:16,260
It's fine.

1513
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:19,020
Let me show you the stat for this one.

1514
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:19,360
Okay.

1515
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:20,620
Let me see if I can find it.

1516
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:23,480
Like I was like...

1517
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:24,920
Question mark?

1518
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:25,900
I'm healing?

1519
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:28,320
Like I was so confused.

1520
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:29,140
I was like...

1521
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:32,540
Why are you mad that I'm healing?

1522
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:34,740
I was so confused.

1523
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:38,280
I was like...

1524
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:39,080
What?

1525
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:42,220
I was healing.

1526
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:44,220
Okay.

1527
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:45,800
Let me see if I can find...

1528
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:47,300
And then like...

1529
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:48,200
And then we found out.

1530
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:48,600
He was...

1531
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:49,620
Cause he was like...

1532
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:50,780
You NA people.

1533
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:53,100
All you do is talk.

1534
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:54,560
And...

1535
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,300
Someone in my chat.

1536
00:58:57,580 --> 00:58:58,380
In my team.

1537
00:58:58,380 --> 00:58:59,280
Was like...

1538
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:00,140
Oh you're EU.

1539
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:02,400
That makes more sense now.

1540
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:04,540
Like I had someone defend me.

1541
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:05,400
They're like...

1542
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:05,660
Bro.

1543
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:08,500
Your EU can't even fucking read.

1544
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:13,160
Okay.

1545
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:15,620
This is the game he was like...

1546
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:17,460
Freaking out about.

1547
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:18,140
Okay.

1548
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:19,620
So like...

1549
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:22,360
Look at what support I had to deal with.

1550
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:23,400
Like...

1551
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,640
Like...

1552
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:27,180
Look at what I had to deal with.

1553
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:28,580
And like...

1554
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:29,520
What do you...

1555
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:30,680
Why EU me?

1556
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:33,360
I had to keep everybody alive.

1557
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:35,740
This fucker wasn't healing.

1558
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:37,060
This...

1559
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:40,920
This...

1560
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:42,960
This fucker wasn't healing.

1561
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:46,860
So I had to keep everybody alive.

1562
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:50,060
Like...

1563
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:51,880
So I was just like...

1564
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:53,320
Why are you so...

1565
00:59:58,080 --> 00:59:59,020
Like...

1566
00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:02,880
And then he flames me.

1567
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:10,400
Oh my god.

1568
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:14,020
I was just like...

1569
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:15,020
Question mark?

1570
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:17,780
What am I getting flamed right now?

1571
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:25,060
Oh, it's time for round 2.

1572
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:25,960
Okay.

1573
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:28,180
But yeah.

1574
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:29,980
It was crazy.

1575
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:30,960
And then like...

1576
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,100
But then he was somebody.

1577
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:33,100
He was like...

1578
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:36,340
He was like top 50 last season too.

1579
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:36,960
I was like...

1580
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,580
Bro, why are you so mad?

1581
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:47,580
He was top 50 last season.

1582
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:49,520
GG.

1583
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:49,820
Good luck.

1584
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:51,240
GG.

1585
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:51,740
GG.

1586
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:52,820
See you next round.

1587
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:53,600
Bye bye.

1588
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:58,840
I was just like...

1589
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:00,080
What the fuck is wrong?

1590
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:01,180
Okay, I'm gonna restart my Discord.

1591
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:04,660
I just thought it was really funny.

1592
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:05,800
I was just like...

1593
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:07,900
I would get random...

1594
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:08,720
No!

1595
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:11,000
Okay, I had random people that were like...

1596
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,980
Good luck in your Creator Cup tomorrow.

1597
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:14,320
And everything.

1598
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,280
And then...

1599
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:17,220
They were like...

1600
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:17,780
Good luck.

1601
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:18,460
Good luck.

1602
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:23,100
And then I would have other people that would just randomly flame me.

1603
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:25,180
And then that guy...

1604
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:26,280
That object guy...

1605
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:26,980
Was like...

1606
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:28,180
What's your excuse?

1607
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:28,900
And I was like...

1608
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:30,740
I didn't play this game in two weeks.

1609
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:31,980
And he was like...

1610
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:33,700
Well, I didn't either.

1611
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:34,920
That's not excuse.

1612
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:36,540
And I looked up his profile.

1613
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:38,400
And he literally played yesterday.

1614
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:39,380
The day before.

1615
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:40,720
The day before that.

1616
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:43,240
And I was like...

1617
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:45,080
Oh, so we're lying now.

1618
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:51,300
I was just like...

1619
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:52,840
Wait, what do you mean?

1620
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:56,980
You were literally playing almost every day.

1621
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:02,540
He was like...

1622
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:05,340
That's not an excuse to play like that.

1623
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:06,560
I was like...

1624
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:06,860
What?

1625
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:10,100
Anyway, I had like three other screenshots too.

1626
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:10,640
I was like...

1627
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:11,160
I don't know.

1628
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:12,000
It was so weird.

1629
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:14,420
I had so many people congratulating me.

1630
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:14,920
But then...

1631
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:16,380
Wishing me good luck.

1632
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:17,740
But I also had like...

1633
01:02:17,740 --> 01:02:20,540
A lot of people just randomly flaming me.

1634
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:21,260
And I was like...

1635
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:22,220
Who are you?

1636
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:24,440
But we would win.

1637
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:27,280
Like, my team would win though.

1638
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:29,260
So I was so confused.

1639
01:02:30,020 --> 01:02:31,240
Because I was like...

1640
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:32,240
But I'm winning.

1641
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:36,020
Why am I getting randomly flamed?

1642
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:39,740
Like...

1643
01:02:40,780 --> 01:02:42,200
But yeah, that was like...

1644
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:43,080
That was yesterday.

1645
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:44,440
I literally was like...

1646
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:45,240
I was like...

1647
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:45,640
Oh my god.

1648
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:48,200
I gotta like speedrun how to play this fucking game again.

1649
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:52,340
I'm now famous.

1650
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:53,200
Yeah.

1651
01:02:53,420 --> 01:02:54,540
It was so weird.

1652
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:55,480
It was actually...

1653
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:59,960
I've never had such a weird grinding session.

1654
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:02,040
And I grinded off stream.

1655
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:04,480
I wasn't even streaming.

1656
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:08,380
I was just like...

1657
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:09,760
What's going on?

1658
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:11,140
What the fuck?

1659
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:17,100
I have to wait for the rate limit period to end.

1660
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:19,280
I have like something called rate limit.

1661
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:20,840
But I don't know what that is.

1662
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:22,840
Apparently, my rate limit...

1663
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:24,860
Well, I fucked up.

1664
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:25,140
Okay.

1665
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:28,840
Let me go to boogers lobby real quick.

1666
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:32,980
So like my Discord is just...

1667
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:34,580
Oh, it isn't working in general.

1668
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:35,400
And I don't...

1669
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:36,100
Like my...

1670
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:38,700
The Discord bubbles just aren't working for me.

1671
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:42,060
Because my Discord isn't letting me...

1672
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:42,500
Yeah.

1673
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:46,300
It says my rate limit resource has been reached for Discord.

1674
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:47,280
I was like...

1675
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:48,580
What does that mean?

1676
01:03:48,580 --> 01:03:51,540
What does that mean?

1677
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:56,240
What do you mean it got hit the limit?

1678
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:01,180
How do I avoid that?

1679
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:02,480
I guess you have to wipe me first.

1680
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:03,420
How are we feeling?

1681
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:04,100
Hello.

1682
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:07,020
You guys look like that non-stop freeze.

1683
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:09,500
Yeah, that was fun.

1684
01:04:12,020 --> 01:04:14,640
And thanks for target banning us.

1685
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:16,040
Bro, I...

1686
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:17,680
Bro, I actually...

1687
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:18,680
I tried to ban second game.

1688
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:19,520
Yeah.

1689
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:22,500
You guys did not need the second ban.

1690
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:23,820
The second ban.

1691
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:24,560
You guys did not need it.

1692
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:26,200
You guys have five support players.

1693
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:28,120
That's my life.

1694
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:29,640
On rank and in here.

1695
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:32,120
Yeah, we need to invite the rest.

1696
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:32,740
I don't have them added.

1697
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:34,440
Oh, I don't have the others added.

1698
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:36,040
Oh yeah, invite me.

1699
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:36,900
Not booger.

1700
01:04:37,180 --> 01:04:37,520
Not booger.

1701
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:38,540
Not booger.

1702
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:40,400
Okay, who am I adding?

1703
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:41,700
Binance, are you?

1704
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:41,980
Yeah.

1705
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:42,540
I got you.

1706
01:04:42,740 --> 01:04:43,160
Gang.

1707
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:44,700
What do you guys mean?

1708
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:46,320
So we can start planning, you know?

1709
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:48,100
I mostly play support.

1710
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:48,280
Oh, wait.

1711
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:49,080
Wait, what?

1712
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:49,940
You just like...

1713
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:51,820
Oh, you invited...

1714
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:52,300
Emily.

1715
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:54,420
Oh, I can invite you back.

1716
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:55,260
You got me out of my lobby.

1717
01:04:55,780 --> 01:04:57,020
You invited me to the lobby.

1718
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:58,220
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1719
01:04:58,220 --> 01:04:59,260
I'll invite you back in.

1720
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:00,580
I thought I was trying to be in your lobby.

1721
01:05:00,580 --> 01:05:01,860
I'll invite you back in.

1722
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:02,580
Don't worry.

1723
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:03,800
I'm sorry, booger.

1724
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:04,420
Oh, you're already in.

1725
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:04,760
Okay.

1726
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:15,480
Oh, but I can mostly...

1727
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:17,620
I can flex the DPS if needed.

1728
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:18,620
We have no DPS players.

1729
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:19,860
Are we sure?

1730
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:20,820
Do we not?

1731
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:21,480
No, we have.

1732
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:21,720
We have.

1733
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:22,920
Wait, who do we have?

1734
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:23,860
Oh, yeah.

1735
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:24,420
Okay.

1736
01:05:24,860 --> 01:05:25,780
I can DPS, too.

1737
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:26,620
If I need to.

1738
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:29,160
Listen, with triple support, she's a dog.

1739
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:29,660
I know.

1740
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:32,900
Booger, you're such a fucker for using triple support.

1741
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:33,580
You're such a...

1742
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:34,540
We have to do support players.

1743
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:34,920
You're such a...

1744
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:36,880
We had five supports.

1745
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:38,760
We didn't even get triple support.

1746
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:42,820
Nobody forced you to play triple support.

1747
01:05:43,780 --> 01:05:44,620
They didn't.

1748
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:46,120
They didn't want to.

1749
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:47,000
Listen, I had to win against X.

1750
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:48,200
I had to win against X.

1751
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:48,920
I had to win against X.

1752
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:49,800
This is revenge.

1753
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:51,300
I had to.

1754
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:53,080
If I lost that, I think I'd retire.

1755
01:05:55,060 --> 01:05:56,180
Like, straight up.

1756
01:05:57,300 --> 01:05:58,680
Can you invite me, please?

1757
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:00,300
To the lobby?

1758
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:01,540
Yes.

1759
01:06:01,780 --> 01:06:02,440
Yes, yes, yes.

1760
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:04,400
I was going to invite you, but then I got invited.

1761
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:05,480
Let me restart my Discord.

1762
01:06:05,580 --> 01:06:06,340
I'll be right back.

1763
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:09,600
Alright, alright, alright.

1764
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:11,900
Okay.

1765
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:13,500
Guys, I think I fixed it.

1766
01:06:13,860 --> 01:06:14,520
I don't know.

1767
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:20,000
I was like, it shows up after I left the team.

1768
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:26,240
I'm so mad.

1769
01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:28,300
I'm so mad.

1770
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:29,440
Did you guys see that?

1771
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:32,240
It showed up after I left the team.

1772
01:06:32,580 --> 01:06:33,640
I'm so mad.

1773
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:37,540
Actually, yeah, because I was like, oh, wait.

1774
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:38,140
It's fixed.

1775
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:41,240
And then, like, I'm so fucking mad.

1776
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:42,960
Like, of course it shows up.

1777
01:06:43,060 --> 01:06:46,020
Like, of course this shows up after I left.

1778
01:06:46,020 --> 01:06:47,420
Like, oh, my God.

1779
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:47,820
Really?

1780
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:48,760
Really?

1781
01:06:52,730 --> 01:06:54,760
It fucking does that.

1782
01:06:56,690 --> 01:06:59,040
Alright, let's see if we can fix this.

1783
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:02,200
I'm a little mad.

1784
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:03,060
Not gonna lie.

1785
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:04,860
Not gonna lie.

1786
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:08,280
I am a little mad right now.

1787
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,100
Are you serious?

1788
01:07:17,260 --> 01:07:20,320
Like, this group fucking hates me.

1789
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:22,780
It actually hates me.

1790
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:30,880
Like, what are the odds that it works after I leave the group chat?

1791
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:40,740
Wait, are you target banning her again?

1792
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:42,000
That's so fucked.

1793
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:42,480
I love it.

1794
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:43,020
Let's do it.

1795
01:07:43,860 --> 01:07:45,020
Let's do it.

1796
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:51,380
Yeah, and then Poki was not happy, but we should do it again.

1797
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:53,380
I was on her team when that happened.

1798
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:57,020
That's so fucked up.

1799
01:07:57,060 --> 01:07:58,020
I love it.

1800
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:05,980
Just so you guys know, Shroud told me that every time he sees me, he's gonna come for me and he's gonna kill me and make everyone focus me.

1801
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:07,000
Oh, okay.

1802
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:08,640
But, like, what if we...

1803
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:09,960
Because you play Cloak, right?

1804
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:13,840
So what if we put someone else on Cloak so he doesn't know?

1805
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:15,800
Oh, we, like, switch it up?

1806
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:17,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1807
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:21,000
I also really want to win this because my arch nemesis is on the other team.

1808
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:22,520
Who's your arch nemesis?

1809
01:08:22,860 --> 01:08:23,300
Cutie.

1810
01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:24,400
I'm a cutie pie.

1811
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:30,800
I heard he plays... I forgot already.

1812
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:34,320
Wait, Sina is a Squirrel Girl player.

1813
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:35,560
Yeah, I played against her.

1814
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:37,400
Yeah, yeah, she only plays Squirrel Girl.

1815
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:40,240
We should ban the Squirrel Girl.

1816
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:41,820
I mean, we could, yeah.

1817
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:42,360
No, no, no, no.

1818
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:44,240
And then you're gonna go triple support.

1819
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:44,880
It's fine, it's fine.

1820
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:47,920
No, I think it's fine.

1821
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:49,120
I'm not scared of Squirrel Girl.

1822
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:50,380
I'm not scared either.

1823
01:08:50,580 --> 01:08:51,140
No, it's fine.

1824
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:51,780
I'm just messing.

1825
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:52,960
Wait, wait, wait.

1826
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:53,280
Hold.

1827
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:54,680
Hold.

1828
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:55,000
Hold.

1829
01:08:55,540 --> 01:08:55,640
Hold.

1830
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:56,120
Hold.

1831
01:08:59,440 --> 01:08:59,800
Hold.

1832
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:00,400
Who's on your team?

1833
01:09:00,620 --> 01:09:01,720
I don't know if he'll be playing tank.

1834
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:02,640
Who's on their team?

1835
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:03,260
He might play tank.

1836
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:06,860
He plays Thor and he can play like strength and stuff.

1837
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:08,820
I mean...

1838
01:09:08,820 --> 01:09:09,980
I think...

1839
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:11,600
So we don't have to waste tank bans.

1840
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:12,600
We just waste...

1841
01:09:13,460 --> 01:09:14,600
I think we ban Penny.

1842
01:09:15,460 --> 01:09:16,540
Yeah, just ban Penny here.

1843
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:18,080
Is there anyone who can force Shroud to play tank?

1844
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:18,620
Is that what you're saying?

1845
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:19,400
Yeah, yeah.

1846
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:20,160
Pretty much.

1847
01:09:21,380 --> 01:09:22,440
What did Shroud play last game?

1848
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:22,960
Does anyone know?

1849
01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:24,600
Was he playing tank or DPS?

1850
01:09:26,380 --> 01:09:27,060
Or no one knows?

1851
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:27,220
Okay.

1852
01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:28,400
No one knows.

1853
01:09:28,580 --> 01:09:29,880
I didn't play against him.

1854
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:31,500
I played against Bulgur and he was a fucker.

1855
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:32,040
Bulgur.

1856
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:33,660
What was Mike playing last game?

1857
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:34,460
What role was he playing?

1858
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:35,800
I can see his history.

1859
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:37,120
He was playing...

1860
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:38,640
He played Adam Warlock.

1861
01:09:38,900 --> 01:09:39,200
Whoa!

1862
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:41,480
At the very end.

1863
01:09:41,780 --> 01:09:42,460
Who is missing?

1864
01:09:42,820 --> 01:09:43,640
I don't have...

1865
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:45,020
We need Shroud and who else?

1866
01:09:45,900 --> 01:09:46,520
Shroud's in here.

1867
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:47,880
Sleepy.

1868
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:49,360
Sleepy and CutiePie.

1869
01:09:49,740 --> 01:09:50,720
I don't have Shroud left.

1870
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:53,580
Shroud played Punisher most of the game last game.

1871
01:09:53,580 --> 01:09:53,900
I see.

1872
01:09:53,900 --> 01:09:57,120
Oh, we could ban Punisher.

1873
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:58,100
His Punisher's good.

1874
01:09:58,140 --> 01:09:59,900
His Punisher's start was good.

1875
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:01,140
I can match it.

1876
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:01,340
I know.

1877
01:10:01,580 --> 01:10:01,880
I know.

1878
01:10:01,940 --> 01:10:03,060
He can match it.

1879
01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:03,960
No guarantees though.

1880
01:10:04,220 --> 01:10:04,840
No guarantees.

1881
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:07,920
Listen, we can't ban out all his picks.

1882
01:10:08,420 --> 01:10:11,460
So if we ban Penny, we can force him on tank.

1883
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:13,620
Or like we can make them uncomfortable positions.

1884
01:10:13,780 --> 01:10:14,900
This guy anti-strats.

1885
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:17,600
No, he's really good at it.

1886
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:18,540
He plays too many characters.

1887
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,360
We can't focus ban him.

1888
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:24,840
We need to focus ban Poki because the crashout will be hilarious.

1889
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:31,120
We have to ban Penny first because they'll protect Penny.

1890
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:33,900
What will Poki play if she doesn't play Penny?

1891
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:34,300
Support.

1892
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:35,980
She plays support.

1893
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:36,400
Yeah.

1894
01:10:36,940 --> 01:10:37,920
I think she plays Luna, right?

1895
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:39,340
I think she was playing Luna earlier.

1896
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:40,420
Okay.

1897
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:44,100
No, no, she played Cloak earlier.

1898
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:44,900
Was it Cloak?

1899
01:10:44,980 --> 01:10:45,240
No.

1900
01:10:45,820 --> 01:10:46,780
Yeah, it was Cloak.

1901
01:10:47,620 --> 01:10:48,660
Wait, Taric, what are you going to play?

1902
01:10:49,260 --> 01:10:49,480
Punisher?

1903
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:51,260
I don't know who I'm going to play actually.

1904
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:53,100
I don't know.

1905
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:54,600
Because I could Rocket too.

1906
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:56,640
Wait, I like that.

1907
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:58,380
I'm down for Rocket or Cloak.

1908
01:10:58,380 --> 01:10:59,360
I could play any support.

1909
01:10:59,820 --> 01:11:02,760
But I think if you just play Cloak, Luna is just default good.

1910
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:03,260
It's so good.

1911
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:06,280
I could play Cloak or Luna or DPS.

1912
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:08,380
Or play DPS, guys.

1913
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:09,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1914
01:11:09,820 --> 01:11:10,020
Okay.

1915
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:12,280
Are we triple supporting it?

1916
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:13,820
Is that what you're saying, guys?

1917
01:11:14,380 --> 01:11:16,260
Are you trying to make us triple support?

1918
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:18,660
Is that what you're trying to say?

1919
01:11:18,660 --> 01:11:20,140
Okay, I'll kill.

1920
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:21,680
I really don't mind killing.

1921
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:22,640
I'm being serious.

1922
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:23,020
Wait, wait, wait.

1923
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:24,000
We can do...

1924
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:25,660
We can do...

1925
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:26,960
Emily...

1926
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:28,060
Wait, Invisible is a healer, right?

1927
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:28,860
Just to make sure or no?

1928
01:11:29,380 --> 01:11:29,700
Yeah.

1929
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:30,140
Yeah, support.

1930
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:30,420
Okay.

1931
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:32,660
Emily and Hannah...

1932
01:11:33,220 --> 01:11:34,300
Wait, DokiBird, what do you play against?

1933
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:36,440
I play support, but I can flex DPS if needed.

1934
01:11:37,940 --> 01:11:38,940
I'm the same way too.

1935
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:41,080
Should we do three heals?

1936
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:41,560
I'm not tank.

1937
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:44,360
Yeah, then we can literally have three heals.

1938
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:44,980
Yeah, yeah.

1939
01:11:45,020 --> 01:11:47,420
Let's do Doki, Emily, and Hannah on heals.

1940
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:48,180
Okay.

1941
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:51,760
And then me DPS and then Boger play a tank.

1942
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:52,480
Does that work?

1943
01:11:52,820 --> 01:11:53,440
I think that works.

1944
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:54,820
That's basically meta.

1945
01:11:55,340 --> 01:11:56,440
They're going to ban Strange.

1946
01:11:56,980 --> 01:11:57,880
I'm going to ban Penny.

1947
01:11:58,100 --> 01:11:58,740
We're going to protect.

1948
01:11:58,980 --> 01:11:59,460
What do we protect?

1949
01:12:00,460 --> 01:12:02,860
I don't think we have anything that needs to be protected.

1950
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:05,020
They might ban like Cloak.

1951
01:12:05,380 --> 01:12:06,120
Since I main it.

1952
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:06,660
Oh, yeah.

1953
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:07,300
Okay, yeah.

1954
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:08,520
We could protect Cloak.

1955
01:12:09,260 --> 01:12:10,000
Who do we...

1956
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:11,360
Who's lobby lead?

1957
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:12,620
Because I got fucking kicked.

1958
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:13,240
I'm going to be lead.

1959
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:14,080
I'm going to be lead.

1960
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:15,840
I'm lead every time.

1961
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:16,500
It's when we're ready, by the way.

1962
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:17,240
Whenever I pick a ban.

1963
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:17,940
Yeah, you need to...

1964
01:12:17,940 --> 01:12:18,780
Okay, you need to...

1965
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:19,900
Make sure it's pick and ban.

1966
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:20,580
Sorry, Boger.

1967
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:22,760
And then play...

1968
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:24,380
We should pick and ban as well, probably.

1969
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:25,360
No, no.

1970
01:12:25,860 --> 01:12:26,660
I'm EU, bro.

1971
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:27,120
I'm EU.

1972
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:28,180
I don't want to play in 200 ping.

1973
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:29,860
Wait, are you both EU?

1974
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:30,820
Nora and Boger?

1975
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:31,800
Nora's also EU.

1976
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:32,640
I'm EU.

1977
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:33,600
Oh, shit.

1978
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:34,620
Wow.

1979
01:12:35,260 --> 01:12:35,560
It's okay.

1980
01:12:35,620 --> 01:12:36,080
We're fine.

1981
01:12:36,220 --> 01:12:36,480
Trust me.

1982
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:38,200
I trust you guys.

1983
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:39,820
I actually warmed up on NA.

1984
01:12:39,820 --> 01:12:40,700
I trust all of you.

1985
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:43,400
I've warmed up on NA servers already.

1986
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:45,340
And I trust you with my life.

1987
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:47,420
We can start.

1988
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:48,300
Just choose a map.

1989
01:12:48,580 --> 01:12:49,400
Any payload map.

1990
01:12:49,660 --> 01:12:50,000
I don't care.

1991
01:12:50,140 --> 01:12:50,400
Honestly.

1992
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:51,640
Payload.

1993
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:53,100
I don't want to play...

1994
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:54,360
What about that Spiderman one?

1995
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:55,260
I like that one.

1996
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:56,240
Sure.

1997
01:12:56,340 --> 01:12:56,500
Whatever.

1998
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:56,920
I don't care.

1999
01:12:58,360 --> 01:12:58,960
No, actually.

2000
01:12:59,160 --> 01:12:59,200
Wait.

2001
01:12:59,240 --> 01:12:59,440
Wait.

2002
01:12:59,540 --> 01:12:59,740
Another.

2003
01:12:59,900 --> 01:13:00,940
Because they have a squirrel player.

2004
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:01,820
We don't want playing it.

2005
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:04,500
We don't want anything that has, like, closed areas.

2006
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:06,660
I don't think that's...

2007
01:13:06,660 --> 01:13:09,180
I don't think that's really good for Squirrel Girl.

2008
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:10,480
Spiderman map?

2009
01:13:11,140 --> 01:13:11,540
Which one?

2010
01:13:11,540 --> 01:13:13,080
Pick a bad Squirrel Girl map.

2011
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:14,080
Maybe I'll...

2012
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:14,420
Okay, listen.

2013
01:13:14,420 --> 01:13:15,040
Just send it.

2014
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:16,500
I don't give a shit.

2015
01:13:16,740 --> 01:13:16,880
I don't give a shit.

2016
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:17,740
Just send it.

2017
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:18,480
Fuck it.

2018
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:18,760
Fuck it.

2019
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:19,600
Fuck it.

2020
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:20,300
Fuck it.

2021
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:20,500
No.

2022
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:22,020
I won't play payload.

2023
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:24,940
He's just like...

2024
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:25,700
No.

2025
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:26,460
Poki's host.

2026
01:13:26,620 --> 01:13:27,340
Poki's host.

2027
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:28,920
Oh.

2028
01:13:33,460 --> 01:13:34,760
Does she have a change anything or no?

2029
01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:38,660
I don't know.

2030
01:13:40,060 --> 01:13:40,880
Do I need any...

2031
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:41,420
I got kicked.

2032
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:42,020
Oh, wait.

2033
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:43,280
Can she just give you the leader?

2034
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:45,140
Just pass you the leader.

2035
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:47,400
Can you pass leader?

2036
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:00,380
I got kicked because of a third party.

2037
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:01,440
Are you hacking?

2038
01:14:01,660 --> 01:14:03,660
So you were hitting all my griddles somehow.

2039
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:07,020
No, I just, I just...

2040
01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:07,600
I don't know.

2041
01:14:07,620 --> 01:14:09,620
I just spam the push thing a lot.

2042
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:11,120
I spam the group ult a lot.

2043
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:14,480
Yeah, makes sense then.

2044
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:29,520
I swear to god guys, if I leave this VC and then go to another VC and then the voice stuff works again, I'm gonna freaking freak out.

2045
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:30,700
I'm actually...

2046
01:14:33,460 --> 01:14:35,760
I'm gonna freaking freak out.

2047
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:40,220
Like, how am I...

2048
01:14:40,220 --> 01:14:42,200
Oh my god, I don't know how I'm this unlucky.

2049
01:14:42,540 --> 01:14:44,220
Like, I don't know, guys.

2050
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:46,580
I don't know, guys.

2051
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:48,220
Why am I so unlucky?

2052
01:14:48,220 --> 01:14:49,140
Why?

2053
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:53,600
Why is the world like this to me?

2054
01:14:59,510 --> 01:15:01,330
I'm gonna crash out.

2055
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:02,850
This grid hates me.

2056
01:15:03,310 --> 01:15:04,590
Whoa, whoops, sorry.

2057
01:15:04,710 --> 01:15:06,550
I fucking swapped scenes accidentally.

2058
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:10,110
I'm gonna try one more time and I swear to god...

2059
01:15:10,110 --> 01:15:12,130
I swear to god...

2060
01:15:13,970 --> 01:15:14,990
It's okay.

2061
01:15:15,230 --> 01:15:16,130
It's okay.

2062
01:15:16,790 --> 01:15:17,410
It's okay.

2063
01:15:17,850 --> 01:15:18,830
It's okay.

2064
01:15:18,830 --> 01:15:20,690
Nothing works, but it's okay.

2065
01:15:21,730 --> 01:15:22,850
It's okay.

2066
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:26,470
It's not okay, but it's okay.

2067
01:15:27,770 --> 01:15:29,290
It's not okay.

2068
01:15:32,540 --> 01:15:33,560
Oh, starting?

2069
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:34,540
We did it, guys.

2070
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:34,800
Starting.

2071
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:35,660
Nice.

2072
01:15:36,020 --> 01:15:36,920
Big moment.

2073
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:37,600
Okay, guys.

2074
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,420
Legendary crash out incoming.

2075
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:41,940
We know what to do.

2076
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:43,560
I believe in us.

2077
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:45,780
Okay, here we go, guys.

2078
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:48,300
Now what?

2079
01:15:50,580 --> 01:15:51,940
Are you gonna play Taric, by the way?

2080
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:54,160
Which DPS do you play?

2081
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:56,620
It's Noira, right?

2082
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:57,620
Wait, wait, wait.

2083
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:59,220
Binance, you're the leader.

2084
01:15:59,380 --> 01:15:59,780
Ban Penny.

2085
01:15:59,980 --> 01:16:00,960
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

2086
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:01,080
Penny.

2087
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:02,860
Done.

2088
01:16:05,780 --> 01:16:07,500
I'll probably play Cylocke, to be honest.

2089
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:08,480
They're gonna ban Strange.

2090
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:10,200
I'm gonna predict the bans.

2091
01:16:10,460 --> 01:16:11,740
And they're gonna protect Wolverine.

2092
01:16:14,140 --> 01:16:15,700
I'm actually banning Sylvia.

2093
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:17,680
Oh, no.

2094
01:16:19,220 --> 01:16:20,060
Are they gonna ban?

2095
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:22,300
I think they're crashing out.

2096
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:23,720
They are crashing out.

2097
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:24,440
They don't know what to do.

2098
01:16:25,580 --> 01:16:25,860
Uh-oh.

2099
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:27,180
Time's ticking.

2100
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:29,120
Yikes.

2101
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:30,560
Oh, it didn't ban.

2102
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:41,500
I guess they're confident.

2103
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:43,140
Okay, listen.

2104
01:16:44,180 --> 01:16:44,980
They're protecting.

2105
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:46,620
Are they gonna protect?

2106
01:16:47,620 --> 01:16:48,140
They may protect.

2107
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:50,560
Should we protect, like, Mr. Fantastic or something?

2108
01:16:50,580 --> 01:16:52,500
No, we should protect.

2109
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:53,160
Oh, what?

2110
01:16:54,020 --> 01:16:54,320
Oh, wait.

2111
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:55,400
No, Poki's the leader.

2112
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:56,000
I don't think she...

2113
01:16:57,060 --> 01:16:58,680
Oh, I don't think she knows.

2114
01:16:59,220 --> 01:17:00,680
Wait, just don't pick anything, then.

2115
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:01,180
It's fine.

2116
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:01,600
No, no, no.

2117
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:02,580
Let's just type.

2118
01:17:03,740 --> 01:17:05,540
Well, we don't have...

2119
01:17:05,540 --> 01:17:06,180
I don't know what to do.

2120
01:17:06,340 --> 01:17:07,640
They didn't type anything.

2121
01:17:10,420 --> 01:17:12,720
Well, we can just delay it for as long as you can.

2122
01:17:12,940 --> 01:17:13,580
Well, just...

2123
01:17:13,580 --> 01:17:14,800
Do I pick Cloak or no?

2124
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:15,700
Just protect Cloak.

2125
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:17,060
Yeah, just protect Cloak.

2126
01:17:17,740 --> 01:17:19,160
You can't make us.

2127
01:17:21,060 --> 01:17:22,960
Okay, who do we ban after this?

2128
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:23,960
I guess we could...

2129
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:24,620
Ban Wolverine.

2130
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:25,240
Wolverine?

2131
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:25,660
All right.

2132
01:17:25,940 --> 01:17:26,720
Okay, Wolverine, Wolverine.

2133
01:17:26,860 --> 01:17:28,000
Oh, yeah, true, true, true.

2134
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:28,340
Sykkuno.

2135
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:29,600
Sykkuno on the empty, right?

2136
01:17:30,620 --> 01:17:32,300
Wait, Pokimane should be doing the game.

2137
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:35,120
You...

2138
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:35,740
Oh, wait, Poki.

2139
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:36,500
They left, they left.

2140
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:37,640
They want a remake.

2141
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:38,540
Oh.

2142
01:17:38,860 --> 01:17:39,180
Wait, what?

2143
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:40,140
What?

2144
01:17:40,340 --> 01:17:40,580
Let's go.

2145
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:41,900
Poki, scratch your left.

2146
01:17:42,180 --> 01:17:43,000
Poki, Poki, left.

2147
01:17:43,340 --> 01:17:44,100
Oh, what?

2148
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:46,040
Okay, I'm gonna go on their channel.

2149
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:46,680
Hold on.

2150
01:17:48,820 --> 01:17:49,940
Wait, what's happening?

2151
01:17:51,140 --> 01:17:52,100
Oh, my God.

2152
01:17:52,660 --> 01:17:53,720
We got the remake?

2153
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:55,780
I guess so.

2154
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:56,320
Leave game.

2155
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:57,580
All right.

2156
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:00,340
You'll need a top-notch team to win this one.

2157
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:00,900
Are we remaking?

2158
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:02,360
Yeah.

2159
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:02,960
How do we leave this?

2160
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,280
Do I have to actually leave the game?

2161
01:18:04,340 --> 01:18:05,820
You just hit escape and then leave game.

2162
01:18:06,100 --> 01:18:07,140
And then Bogor can remake.

2163
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:07,540
All right.

2164
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:10,760
I think we just typed it out.

2165
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:13,080
Yeah, we could've just typed it out.

2166
01:18:13,220 --> 01:18:14,040
That's what I was saying.

2167
01:18:14,380 --> 01:18:16,260
I don't think they understood what I was going to say.

2168
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:18,660
Now they know our strategy.

2169
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:19,800
I can make the lobby.

2170
01:18:23,980 --> 01:18:24,920
That's funny.

2171
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:27,140
That's funny.

2172
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:28,440
I'm making the lobby again.

2173
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:32,120
All right, we're back here again.

2174
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,880
We'll restart my Discord one last time.

2175
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:37,300
See my foogies fucking pop up.

2176
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:38,000
I'll be right back.

2177
01:18:40,660 --> 01:18:42,900
All right, one last time.

2178
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:46,880
I will restart you one last time.

2179
01:18:47,620 --> 01:18:48,220
Please.

2180
01:18:48,570 --> 01:18:50,580
I don't understand.

2181
01:18:52,270 --> 01:18:54,280
Why aren't you working?

2182
01:18:54,820 --> 01:18:56,700
I don't understand.

2183
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:03,180
I just want people to know who's talking.

2184
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:07,980
Like...

2185
01:19:08,470 --> 01:19:11,380
Is that too much to ask for?

2186
01:19:13,130 --> 01:19:15,020
It's not working, guys.

2187
01:19:17,180 --> 01:19:18,200
It's...

2188
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:19,760
I don't know why.

2189
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:22,620
I don't know why it's not working.

2190
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:25,500
Like...

2191
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:27,000
Just...

2192
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,880
God doesn't want me happy.

2193
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:36,210
God just hates me.

2194
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:42,860
He's just like...

2195
01:19:42,860 --> 01:19:46,900
If anybody can't be happy, I wish it was Doki Bird.

2196
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:49,560
It's so fucked up.

2197
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:51,040
It really is.

2198
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:52,820
Like, this works.

2199
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:54,900
I don't understand.

2200
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:00,820
But this doesn't?

2201
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:08,760
I call my therapist right now.

2202
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:13,080
Oh my god.

2203
01:20:15,940 --> 01:20:20,540
Like, it looks like you're having trouble connecting to your Discord.

2204
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:21,840
I'm like, yep.

2205
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:22,940
Yep.

2206
01:20:23,740 --> 01:20:25,100
Looks like it.

2207
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:25,980
Okay.

2208
01:20:29,580 --> 01:20:30,280
I don't...

2209
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:30,960
I don't remember.

2210
01:20:31,140 --> 01:20:31,780
I don't know either.

2211
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:34,140
It was like a shiny gold map.

2212
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:35,700
Alright, there's still...

2213
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:37,380
Oh, there's Loki one that we were playing.

2214
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:39,960
We're still trying to figure out the map.

2215
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:42,280
Yes, correct.

2216
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,020
God just doesn't want me to have a good time.

2217
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:50,740
I woke up with no voice.

2218
01:20:51,020 --> 01:20:51,260
Yes.

2219
01:20:51,260 --> 01:20:54,860
And I was just like, is today gonna be a good day today?

2220
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:58,400
Here we go, let's see if they do it right.

2221
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:02,020
Is today gonna be a good day today?

2222
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:05,820
And then I was like, maybe today would be a good day.

2223
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:07,120
Maybe.

2224
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:12,280
It just says like, Discord doesn't exist for me.

2225
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:14,360
That's like the weirdest shit.

2226
01:21:14,540 --> 01:21:16,560
It just be like, Discord doesn't...

2227
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:17,040
You can't...

2228
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:18,060
We can't connect to Discord.

2229
01:21:18,820 --> 01:21:19,680
I'm like, what do you mean?

2230
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:21,540
I'm in Discord right now.

2231
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:22,680
What the fuck do you mean?

2232
01:21:27,060 --> 01:21:29,260
I should have like, restarted my PC.

2233
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:35,360
Why do they build my Invisible Woman?

2234
01:21:36,460 --> 01:21:37,900
No, they're targeting you, Emily.

2235
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:43,600
You should be like, proud of that.

2236
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:44,960
It's like an accomplishment.

2237
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:47,180
They're that scared of your Invisible Woman.

2238
01:21:47,340 --> 01:21:48,760
Wait, yeah, that's actually a compliment.

2239
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:51,060
Yeah, they're that scared of you.

2240
01:21:51,820 --> 01:21:53,080
But I'm terrible.

2241
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:53,700
Why are you...

2242
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:55,140
They're just doing this for...

2243
01:21:55,140 --> 01:21:57,060
No, you're not terrible on Invisible Woman.

2244
01:21:57,520 --> 01:21:59,440
Oh, thank you, Tarek.

2245
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:00,560
You're fucking my shit up.

2246
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:01,440
But what are you gonna...

2247
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:02,680
What's your next go-to?

2248
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,600
I mean, I play either Luna or Mantis or Cloak.

2249
01:22:05,860 --> 01:22:06,300
All right, we're...

2250
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:07,380
I can play Squirrel Girl.

2251
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:08,260
You can play...

2252
01:22:08,260 --> 01:22:09,580
You can play whatever support.

2253
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:10,960
You can play five different characters.

2254
01:22:11,820 --> 01:22:13,320
But they picked Wolverine.

2255
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:14,380
They protected...

2256
01:22:14,380 --> 01:22:16,660
Yeah, because Sykkuno plays Wolverine.

2257
01:22:21,060 --> 01:22:23,600
Oh, we'll see what they ban, I guess.

2258
01:22:29,540 --> 01:22:31,900
I mean, we could ban Luna.

2259
01:22:33,340 --> 01:22:34,200
What do you play, Doki?

2260
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:35,300
I play any support.

2261
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:39,280
Not just a Luna one trick, what the fuck?

2262
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:40,120
I know, I know, I know.

2263
01:22:40,220 --> 01:22:40,840
I never said that.

2264
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:41,400
I never said that.

2265
01:22:41,980 --> 01:22:42,960
You would ban like...

2266
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:45,540
We can ban Starlord or...

2267
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:46,480
Storm?

2268
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:47,880
Storm?

2269
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:49,180
Shroud plays a lot of Storm.

2270
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:50,820
Yeah, ban Storm, ban Storm, ban Storm, ban Storm.

2271
01:22:51,420 --> 01:22:52,300
Fuck it, send it.

2272
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:54,660
Okay.

2273
01:22:55,460 --> 01:22:56,930
The only issue is that we can't...

2274
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:01,080
The only biggest issue, we can't get rid of flankers.

2275
01:23:01,260 --> 01:23:03,480
Because Invisible Woman and Luna is banned.

2276
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:06,820
Wait, should we do Raccoon Punisher or not really?

2277
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:07,500
We could do...

2278
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:08,040
I could always...

2279
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:08,740
You can do that.

2280
01:23:09,620 --> 01:23:10,300
Or should I just play...

2281
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:11,120
I'm down for either.

2282
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:11,880
Okay.

2283
01:23:12,460 --> 01:23:17,580
If you want to play Rocket, I could play Mantis and then we'll try to sleep the flankers.

2284
01:23:17,780 --> 01:23:18,450
Or I'll try to sleep...

2285
01:23:19,020 --> 01:23:19,320
Yeah.

2286
01:23:20,220 --> 01:23:21,160
I'm gonna play Rocket.

2287
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:24,740
I'll play Mantis and I'll try to sleep the Wolverine then.

2288
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:25,160
Okay, guys.

2289
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:29,540
I don't have a lot of experience on Rocket, but I'm gonna be right.

2290
01:23:30,060 --> 01:23:32,040
Don't worry, people will know how to play Rocket.

2291
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:35,080
Just stick to Punisher and make sure your beacons are always down.

2292
01:23:35,220 --> 01:23:35,920
Listen, Tariq.

2293
01:23:37,740 --> 01:23:39,080
Everything lies on you, okay?

2294
01:23:39,700 --> 01:23:41,760
They're gonna have Wolverine, you need to shoot that guy.

2295
01:23:42,900 --> 01:23:43,740
I'm sorry, what did you say?

2296
01:23:43,940 --> 01:23:45,540
You need to shoot the Wolverine.

2297
01:23:45,660 --> 01:23:46,440
Shoot the Wolverine?

2298
01:23:46,820 --> 01:23:47,180
Lol gag.

2299
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:49,440
I'm gonna be fighting demons the entire game, bro.

2300
01:23:51,460 --> 01:23:52,800
Yeah, the Wolverine's gonna be annoying.

2301
01:23:53,940 --> 01:23:55,000
We gotta make sure...

2302
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:58,600
We're gonna have to make sure to pour a lot of resources to Bogre if he gets caught by Wolverine.

2303
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:01,100
I'm gonna save my bubble for him.

2304
01:24:01,140 --> 01:24:02,160
I won't get caught, it's crazy.

2305
01:24:02,540 --> 01:24:03,160
Oh, good.

2306
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:05,900
Do you wanna call when you want infinite ammo?

2307
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:11,620
I can, but if there's good corners, I think around the corners are good.

2308
01:24:12,420 --> 01:24:13,680
Oh, you should be up here.

2309
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:17,940
I can call it, but if you want a place that you can too.

2310
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:19,280
I'll just ask every now and then.

2311
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:19,840
Okay.

2312
01:24:21,820 --> 01:24:23,120
That guy's low in the front, is he getting healed?

2313
01:24:23,220 --> 01:24:23,560
The fuck?

2314
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:27,360
Let me know if you guys see Wolverine, okay?

2315
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:28,220
Just let me know and I'll turn.

2316
01:24:30,260 --> 01:24:31,240
Oh, did they kill the beacon?

2317
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:31,640
Whoops.

2318
01:24:33,220 --> 01:24:35,100
Yeah, you wanna like put it at a site kind of?

2319
01:24:35,680 --> 01:24:37,980
Yeah, push him, push him.

2320
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:39,280
Oh, I'm stunned, I'm stunned.

2321
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:40,460
I'm okay, yeah, I'm okay.

2322
01:24:45,350 --> 01:24:46,210
It's like, I'm gonna pass it.

2323
01:24:46,590 --> 01:24:46,990
I could as well.

2324
01:24:50,790 --> 01:24:51,170
Got one.

2325
01:24:53,230 --> 01:24:54,090
Damage boost to you?

2326
01:24:55,670 --> 01:24:56,890
He's going to my right, is he?

2327
01:24:56,890 --> 01:24:57,630
It's a clone, they'll pass it.

2328
01:25:00,170 --> 01:25:01,870
He's behind the cart, uh, the Wolverine.

2329
01:25:02,710 --> 01:25:04,550
That's fine, he missed his, he missed his grab.

2330
01:25:06,590 --> 01:25:07,050
What's the?

2331
01:25:07,610 --> 01:25:08,970
Right side, right side, look your right side.

2332
01:25:09,470 --> 01:25:10,050
Just so I know.

2333
01:25:11,350 --> 01:25:12,610
Can we kill clones as well?

2334
01:25:14,650 --> 01:25:15,650
Wolverine's top, top left.

2335
01:25:16,750 --> 01:25:17,510
I have damage boost to you.

2336
01:25:18,210 --> 01:25:19,110
Can we ult this or no?

2337
01:25:19,650 --> 01:25:20,330
We don't have anything.

2338
01:25:20,510 --> 01:25:21,470
I died, oh my god.

2339
01:25:21,830 --> 01:25:24,190
Do we have any ults for support?

2340
01:25:24,290 --> 01:25:24,730
Not yet.

2341
01:25:25,670 --> 01:25:26,850
Okay, I'm 73 right now.

2342
01:25:26,850 --> 01:25:27,490
Stay with me, play with me.

2343
01:25:27,970 --> 01:25:28,630
Can we get back in?

2344
01:25:28,670 --> 01:25:29,150
I damage boost to you.

2345
01:25:29,150 --> 01:25:29,710
I'm ulting in now.

2346
01:25:29,710 --> 01:25:30,430
Yeah, yeah, yeah, play, play, play.

2347
01:25:30,590 --> 01:25:30,930
I'm ulting in now.

2348
01:25:31,010 --> 01:25:31,810
I damage boost to you.

2349
01:25:32,150 --> 01:25:32,650
Do you have bubble?

2350
01:25:32,870 --> 01:25:33,130
Uh-oh.

2351
01:25:33,190 --> 01:25:33,770
Yeah, bubble, bubble her.

2352
01:25:34,330 --> 01:25:34,690
I got you.

2353
01:25:35,010 --> 01:25:35,490
Thank you.

2354
01:25:35,910 --> 01:25:37,830
I have, uh, I'll be healing you guys, I'm ulting.

2355
01:25:38,370 --> 01:25:39,730
Get in the blue, get in the blue, you're fine.

2356
01:25:41,850 --> 01:25:42,470
All right, I got you.

2357
01:25:43,910 --> 01:25:45,030
Your damage, damage boosted?

2358
01:25:49,980 --> 01:25:52,560
Oh my god, I haven't played fucking Mantis in so long.

2359
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:55,320
Yeah, I couldn't do anything, sorry.

2360
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:57,100
I'm rezzed, I'm rezzed, I'm rezzed.

2361
01:25:57,400 --> 01:25:57,720
That's good.

2362
01:25:58,120 --> 01:25:59,360
Okay, Doki, you have your ult?

2363
01:25:59,460 --> 01:26:00,480
Yeah, we're gonna have a Warren ult.

2364
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:00,960
Okay, watch out.

2365
01:26:01,020 --> 01:26:02,960
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

2366
01:26:02,980 --> 01:26:04,020
Play slow, play slow, play slow.

2367
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:04,900
Watch out, he's stuck.

2368
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:06,640
97, 97, 97.

2369
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:07,820
I'll be back soon, I'll be back soon right now.

2370
01:26:08,380 --> 01:26:08,860
So scary.

2371
01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:09,720
I got it, I got it, I got it.

2372
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:09,800
Ready?

2373
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:11,140
Shoot it, shoot it, shoot it, shoot the squirt.

2374
01:26:11,380 --> 01:26:12,760
I'm shooting it, I'm shooting it, I'm shooting it, I'm shooting it.

2375
01:26:12,780 --> 01:26:13,340
It's down, it's down.

2376
01:26:14,160 --> 01:26:14,840
I'm getting fucked.

2377
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:15,960
I'm ulting you, I'm ulting you.

2378
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:18,300
There you go.

2379
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:19,240
Push this, push this, push this.

2380
01:26:20,020 --> 01:26:20,480
That's huge.

2381
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:21,320
You're crazy.

2382
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:21,920
We're going to the back.

2383
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:23,260
I blinded him, I blinded him.

2384
01:26:28,700 --> 01:26:29,580
I can't get to you, Ogre.

2385
01:26:29,660 --> 01:26:30,040
They're going on me.

2386
01:26:30,580 --> 01:26:31,120
I got you, I got you.

2387
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:31,400
He's low.

2388
01:26:31,580 --> 01:26:32,120
Shoot him, shoot him.

2389
01:26:34,060 --> 01:26:34,440
We're good.

2390
01:26:35,460 --> 01:26:36,000
Are they all good?

2391
01:26:36,780 --> 01:26:37,440
Yeah, we're good, we're good.

2392
01:26:40,540 --> 01:26:41,020
Damage boosting.

2393
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:47,400
I'm going to take a bunch of damage.

2394
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:55,260
I need to stay back a little bit.

2395
01:26:55,620 --> 01:26:56,720
Yeah, we need your root for sure.

2396
01:26:57,400 --> 01:26:58,400
Don't get one-shot, Luchette.

2397
01:27:03,460 --> 01:27:06,780
I'm safe here.

2398
01:27:08,580 --> 01:27:09,660
Oh, Carro, come on, Carro, Carro, Carro.

2399
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:10,680
I'm getting fucked.

2400
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:11,740
Back me up.

2401
01:27:16,140 --> 01:27:18,660
I slept Mag, I slept Mag, I slept Mag.

2402
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:19,700
I got one-shot.

2403
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:21,240
I'm trying to get to you, Blue.

2404
01:27:22,060 --> 01:27:22,940
I got one of them, guys.

2405
01:27:24,380 --> 01:27:25,580
I got the Blue Marines.

2406
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,240
We have to...

2407
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:28,600
I'm on my way back.

2408
01:27:29,180 --> 01:27:30,120
I'm pushing out, I'm pushing out.

2409
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:31,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2410
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:33,020
No Blue Marine right now.

2411
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:33,920
You guys can do it.

2412
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:36,980
I'm trying to kill that Taric, trying to kill that here.

2413
01:27:37,900 --> 01:27:38,840
I can't get it, I'm right here.

2414
01:27:38,940 --> 01:27:39,200
Can't leave.

2415
01:27:39,380 --> 01:27:40,640
Oh, they're just not getting it.

2416
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:41,380
I'm right here, I'm here.

2417
01:27:41,380 --> 01:27:43,180
I'm gonna back up, I have ult.

2418
01:27:49,870 --> 01:27:50,190
Whoa.

2419
01:27:50,990 --> 01:27:53,690
Fuck, I should have backed up.

2420
01:27:56,250 --> 01:27:57,790
Yeah, we should have got out of that corner.

2421
01:27:58,030 --> 01:27:58,890
Like, go out the other way.

2422
01:27:58,890 --> 01:28:00,810
Yeah, yeah, don't go into the corners, guys.

2423
01:28:03,210 --> 01:28:03,850
Oh, shit.

2424
01:28:04,210 --> 01:28:05,010
Should be fine.

2425
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:05,850
Helper.

2426
01:28:06,170 --> 01:28:06,690
Here, I got you.

2427
01:28:07,250 --> 01:28:07,730
I'm here, I'm here.

2428
01:28:09,050 --> 01:28:10,090
Blue Marine on me, I'm good.

2429
01:28:10,890 --> 01:28:11,510
I got you, I got you.

2430
01:28:11,810 --> 01:28:13,830
They bubbled, they already bubbled.

2431
01:28:13,890 --> 01:28:14,350
They don't have bubble.

2432
01:28:15,530 --> 01:28:17,110
Yeah, I'm pocketing you, I'm pocketing you.

2433
01:28:17,310 --> 01:28:18,170
Yeah, we're both pocketing.

2434
01:28:18,210 --> 01:28:18,770
We're in the corner.

2435
01:28:19,490 --> 01:28:20,150
We're pocketing you hard.

2436
01:28:20,230 --> 01:28:20,910
Push, push, man, man, man, man.

2437
01:28:21,610 --> 01:28:21,910
I'm up.

2438
01:28:22,730 --> 01:28:23,610
You're fine, you're fine, you're fine.

2439
01:28:24,550 --> 01:28:25,190
Here, here.

2440
01:28:26,190 --> 01:28:26,570
High ground.

2441
01:28:28,530 --> 01:28:29,750
Oh, there's a Wolverine.

2442
01:28:29,810 --> 01:28:30,570
I got you, I got you, I got you.

2443
01:28:30,610 --> 01:28:31,630
You're safe, you're safe, you're safe.

2444
01:28:31,730 --> 01:28:32,330
Oh, thank you, thank you.

2445
01:28:32,770 --> 01:28:34,730
Oh, we double support ulted, that's my bad.

2446
01:28:35,110 --> 01:28:35,590
Oh, shit.

2447
01:28:39,550 --> 01:28:42,510
We gotta get this fight because we have to double support ulted.

2448
01:28:42,830 --> 01:28:43,910
You can kill Wolverine, kill Wolverine.

2449
01:28:45,130 --> 01:28:46,730
I don't see him, I don't see him, I don't see him.

2450
01:28:47,090 --> 01:28:47,850
Yeah, we're down three.

2451
01:28:48,170 --> 01:28:50,150
I didn't see Wolverine, sorry, I was too much going on.

2452
01:28:50,930 --> 01:28:51,570
It's okay, it's okay.

2453
01:29:00,970 --> 01:29:02,550
You guys can reset.

2454
01:29:03,290 --> 01:29:04,670
I almost killed like three of them.

2455
01:29:04,670 --> 01:29:05,550
Can you live or no?

2456
01:29:05,610 --> 01:29:06,290
Can you live or no?

2457
01:29:06,490 --> 01:29:07,330
I'm gonna get a res here.

2458
01:29:07,830 --> 01:29:08,190
No, you're fine.

2459
01:29:08,250 --> 01:29:09,130
Oh, you have a penta, you're fine.

2460
01:29:09,230 --> 01:29:09,950
I'm gonna get a res.

2461
01:29:09,990 --> 01:29:11,110
Here, here, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2462
01:29:11,430 --> 01:29:12,450
I shouldn't have gone out, sorry.

2463
01:29:12,510 --> 01:29:12,670
Yeah.

2464
01:29:12,670 --> 01:29:15,890
We might need Nora to maybe go on the Hawkeye.

2465
01:29:16,130 --> 01:29:17,250
Okay, yeah, I can do that.

2466
01:29:23,020 --> 01:29:23,860
Damage boosting you.

2467
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:27,280
I'm going into the...

2468
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:29,100
I'm just going to pocket you for now, over here.

2469
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:30,740
Oh, Taric, don't!

2470
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:31,560
Don't do that!

2471
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:33,500
He's a weird.

2472
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:35,840
I'm getting cooked.

2473
01:29:35,900 --> 01:29:37,320
I fucked him, so I'm gonna die for it.

2474
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:38,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you won this.

2475
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:39,560
Go, go, go, go, go.

2476
01:29:39,660 --> 01:29:40,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2477
01:29:42,740 --> 01:29:43,280
I'm low.

2478
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:45,000
I don't think I can get...

2479
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:45,640
I'm healing you.

2480
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:48,440
I'm just gonna, I'm gonna play low-key.

2481
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:49,500
We kinda just have to walk out.

2482
01:29:49,660 --> 01:29:50,460
Pugra's the only one on point.

2483
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:52,860
I think we swap the rat.

2484
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:55,260
I think we swap the rat and Punisher.

2485
01:29:56,720 --> 01:29:57,720
I don't be real with you guys.

2486
01:29:58,240 --> 01:30:00,140
You use Punisher ult, and we get...

2487
01:30:00,140 --> 01:30:01,100
Yeah, I don't think, yeah.

2488
01:30:02,180 --> 01:30:04,060
TP, TP, TP for spawn, TP for spawn.

2489
01:30:04,340 --> 01:30:04,680
Over in spawn.

2490
01:30:05,460 --> 01:30:06,580
You want me to play something else, or?

2491
01:30:06,820 --> 01:30:07,460
Yeah, yeah, swap, swap, swap.

2492
01:30:07,620 --> 01:30:09,700
I can swap as well if we need me to swap.

2493
01:30:09,700 --> 01:30:11,660
Yeah, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good.

2494
01:30:11,660 --> 01:30:13,400
I'm like, not in the, I'm, I'm at a wrong spawn.

2495
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:14,280
What the fuck am I?

2496
01:30:14,900 --> 01:30:16,480
You, uh, yeah.

2497
01:30:16,600 --> 01:30:18,540
He's gonna, I don't think he's gonna live.

2498
01:30:18,780 --> 01:30:20,500
You can go in the spawn room, I hit G, right?

2499
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:23,580
Yeah, but he's, he, the timing was off already.

2500
01:30:24,100 --> 01:30:25,520
Yeah, I died earlier.

2501
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:27,660
I'm gonna be late as fuck.

2502
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:28,680
It's fine.

2503
01:30:29,940 --> 01:30:30,800
Oh my god, I'm dead.

2504
01:30:34,140 --> 01:30:34,780
Thanks for the bubble.

2505
01:30:38,360 --> 01:30:38,880
I'm grabbed.

2506
01:30:40,120 --> 01:30:42,420
I gave you invuln, I'll give you invuln here.

2507
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:44,880
Kiting, kiting.

2508
01:30:44,900 --> 01:30:45,560
Can we match?

2509
01:30:45,940 --> 01:30:47,500
I'll team back in 3, 2, 1.

2510
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:48,500
I'll team back.

2511
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:50,940
I don't, no!

2512
01:30:51,140 --> 01:30:52,360
I don't have ult here.

2513
01:30:52,940 --> 01:30:54,560
I'm dead, I'm dead, he didn't hit me, he didn't hit me.

2514
01:30:55,240 --> 01:30:56,680
I have my ult too.

2515
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:06,340
This Hawkeye is coming for me.

2516
01:31:06,680 --> 01:31:08,420
Yeah, I'm not dead at all, I'm coming.

2517
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:09,980
Oh, I can't.

2518
01:31:09,980 --> 01:31:10,620
I'm not grouped right now.

2519
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:14,340
Can we get out or no?

2520
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:14,720
I got him.

2521
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:15,420
That's fine, that's fine.

2522
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:19,140
Magneto's dead.

2523
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:19,860
That's fine, that's fine.

2524
01:31:27,370 --> 01:31:28,630
Watch out, the Hawkeye ult.

2525
01:31:29,190 --> 01:31:29,630
We're getting one.

2526
01:31:31,630 --> 01:31:33,510
I need, I need, I need someone to peek.

2527
01:31:33,590 --> 01:31:35,290
Oh, I couldn't.

2528
01:31:35,510 --> 01:31:36,850
I couldn't support ult there.

2529
01:31:37,530 --> 01:31:38,330
I'm coming, I'm coming.

2530
01:31:38,330 --> 01:31:39,310
I need to clone somebody.

2531
01:31:42,390 --> 01:31:46,270
Okay, I'm not gonna lie, I felt like I wasn't a part of half of our teamfights there.

2532
01:31:46,570 --> 01:31:51,430
But also, the choke point, that little hole choke point is so hard to get out of.

2533
01:31:52,450 --> 01:31:54,530
Like, I don't know if you guys know what I'm talking, anyway, fuck it.

2534
01:31:55,970 --> 01:31:57,190
We need to counter Hawkeye.

2535
01:31:57,270 --> 01:31:59,570
I can kill the Hawkeye, I can kill him way easier.

2536
01:32:00,230 --> 01:32:01,270
Okay, that sounds good.

2537
01:32:02,050 --> 01:32:02,990
It'll be good with Loki too.

2538
01:32:03,490 --> 01:32:03,810
Okay.

2539
01:32:05,930 --> 01:32:07,210
Do we still want to triple support?

2540
01:32:07,450 --> 01:32:08,130
Let's try this.

2541
01:32:11,050 --> 01:32:11,950
Yeah, it's real support.

2542
01:32:13,290 --> 01:32:14,870
Okay, Dyrone, you have to do all the work.

2543
01:32:16,450 --> 01:32:16,690
Okay.

2544
01:32:17,450 --> 01:32:18,450
I'm gonna punch his ass.

2545
01:32:18,910 --> 01:32:19,590
Wait, were you playing Hella?

2546
01:32:19,730 --> 01:32:20,710
Sorry, I didn't know I took it.

2547
01:32:20,870 --> 01:32:21,990
No, no, you're chilling.

2548
01:32:22,410 --> 01:32:23,790
Yeah, go Hella.

2549
01:32:24,010 --> 01:32:25,450
I just literally swapped at the very end.

2550
01:32:25,870 --> 01:32:26,610
Nori, do you play tank?

2551
01:32:32,330 --> 01:32:32,970
I play...

2552
01:32:32,970 --> 01:32:35,290
The only tank I play is...

2553
01:32:36,370 --> 01:32:36,730
Groot.

2554
01:32:37,370 --> 01:32:38,970
Yeah, I didn't think I was gonna be good against him.

2555
01:32:39,250 --> 01:32:39,630
Nah, it's fine.

2556
01:32:39,890 --> 01:32:43,030
Yeah, Groot is way too farmable against that.

2557
01:32:44,230 --> 01:32:44,590
Yeah.

2558
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:50,520
I could go Hawkeye, Loki.

2559
01:32:51,780 --> 01:32:52,840
You can, do it.

2560
01:32:53,420 --> 01:32:54,540
We just need to deal with Childe, guys.

2561
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:56,000
We think that was kind of whatever.

2562
01:33:17,710 --> 01:33:19,170
Thank you, thank you.

2563
01:33:22,490 --> 01:33:24,370
Oh my god, are you guys okay?

2564
01:33:24,590 --> 01:33:25,870
One shot on my ass.

2565
01:33:26,270 --> 01:33:26,690
Yeah.

2566
01:33:27,770 --> 01:33:28,950
Are you guys okay?

2567
01:33:30,250 --> 01:33:30,890
We're just consistent.

2568
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:37,700
I'm with Mike, Mike, Mike.

2569
01:33:38,220 --> 01:33:39,300
We gotta help both.

2570
01:33:40,160 --> 01:33:40,720
Hawkeye's one-shot.

2571
01:33:41,660 --> 01:33:42,140
I'm with Mike, Mike, Mike.

2572
01:33:42,140 --> 01:33:42,840
He's still low.

2573
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:45,100
Any heals here?

2574
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:48,140
Got you, got you.

2575
01:34:01,140 --> 01:34:03,460
One shot again.

2576
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:04,860
Okay.

2577
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:06,520
Our comms are ducking down.

2578
01:34:06,680 --> 01:34:08,140
We have to reset.

2579
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:10,860
We're not comming anymore either.

2580
01:34:11,820 --> 01:34:13,060
Let's do a team push here.

2581
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:16,080
Boger, take over.

2582
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:19,920
Boger, as the highest ranked player, you should be ideal.

2583
01:34:27,420 --> 01:34:28,320
I'm just kidding.

2584
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:31,120
Yeah, I can't even get put clone on you.

2585
01:34:31,300 --> 01:34:32,360
The demons are after me, guys.

2586
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:32,980
This game.

2587
01:34:37,710 --> 01:34:38,990
I might have to ult in here.

2588
01:34:39,210 --> 01:34:39,490
I can ult now.

2589
01:34:39,490 --> 01:34:40,150
I have ult.

2590
01:34:41,550 --> 01:34:42,710
Yeah, we can't push up at all.

2591
01:34:42,950 --> 01:34:43,810
That's the issue.

2592
01:34:45,570 --> 01:34:47,470
Listen, guys, we need to make some swaps.

2593
01:34:48,270 --> 01:34:49,250
We need something diveable.

2594
01:34:49,310 --> 01:34:50,550
Do you play something diveable, Taric?

2595
01:34:50,990 --> 01:34:51,970
Do you play dive characters?

2596
01:34:52,390 --> 01:34:53,350
I don't have a dive character.

2597
01:34:54,730 --> 01:34:55,370
I'm not gonna lie.

2598
01:34:57,270 --> 01:34:58,490
Oh my god.

2599
01:34:58,850 --> 01:35:00,850
Okay, I'll just go back to Punisher.

2600
01:35:00,970 --> 01:35:02,310
I think Punisher is better.

2601
01:35:02,770 --> 01:35:07,470
He might just support ult to push up.

2602
01:35:07,990 --> 01:35:09,310
I think we have to.

2603
01:35:09,410 --> 01:35:11,570
We just need to support ult to push up on this.

2604
01:35:12,190 --> 01:35:13,170
Because we got a kill now.

2605
01:35:13,290 --> 01:35:13,710
I'm doing it.

2606
01:35:14,710 --> 01:35:15,110
Oh my god.

2607
01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:18,990
Nice, nice.

2608
01:35:19,010 --> 01:35:19,470
That's huge.

2609
01:35:20,910 --> 01:35:21,790
Focus the mag.

2610
01:35:23,790 --> 01:35:25,590
I'm just gonna stab him.

2611
01:35:25,730 --> 01:35:26,830
Maybe we let him live a little bit.

2612
01:35:27,650 --> 01:35:28,210
There you go.

2613
01:35:34,370 --> 01:35:35,090
They didn't.

2614
01:35:35,090 --> 01:35:36,470
They did not use any support ults.

2615
01:35:37,310 --> 01:35:39,330
Okay, that might be GG for us.

2616
01:35:39,790 --> 01:35:40,370
No, I have my ult.

2617
01:35:40,910 --> 01:35:41,750
I have mine too.

2618
01:35:42,630 --> 01:35:43,590
Where's our cloak?

2619
01:35:43,930 --> 01:35:43,930
Okay.

2620
01:35:45,290 --> 01:35:46,850
We're just gonna be back here.

2621
01:35:47,070 --> 01:35:47,850
I killed Trap.

2622
01:35:49,590 --> 01:35:49,990
Wolverine.

2623
01:35:51,870 --> 01:35:52,790
Where are you?

2624
01:35:53,030 --> 01:35:53,490
Okay, you're here.

2625
01:35:58,160 --> 01:35:58,560
Alright.

2626
01:36:00,180 --> 01:36:00,740
I'm one.

2627
01:36:01,680 --> 01:36:02,180
Oh, we're dead.

2628
01:36:02,360 --> 01:36:02,660
I'm dead.

2629
01:36:03,140 --> 01:36:04,380
Just be on my ult.

2630
01:36:04,380 --> 01:36:04,920
I'll be on my ult.

2631
01:36:05,020 --> 01:36:05,560
Nice, nice.

2632
01:36:06,020 --> 01:36:07,680
We're even.

2633
01:36:07,940 --> 01:36:09,160
I need heals in back.

2634
01:36:09,320 --> 01:36:09,620
Play point.

2635
01:36:11,680 --> 01:36:13,060
Support, support.

2636
01:36:13,140 --> 01:36:17,720
Here we go.

2637
01:36:20,380 --> 01:36:21,120
I'm ulting.

2638
01:36:24,140 --> 01:36:26,500
There's a Hawkeye on our backline.

2639
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:29,180
Last play here.

2640
01:36:29,180 --> 01:36:30,260
I thought I was gonna support ult.

2641
01:36:32,860 --> 01:36:33,860
Can I try DPS?

2642
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:37,320
No, I don't think so.

2643
01:36:37,540 --> 01:36:38,240
I think we still DPS.

2644
01:36:39,780 --> 01:36:40,240
I'm down.

2645
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:42,920
My Dino's half.

2646
01:36:49,810 --> 01:36:52,090
Am I jumping into his bullets?

2647
01:36:52,550 --> 01:36:53,510
Oh my god.

2648
01:36:57,070 --> 01:36:58,330
Are you guys okay?

2649
01:36:58,910 --> 01:36:59,850
Are you guys okay?

2650
01:37:00,310 --> 01:37:02,370
Are you guys okay?

2651
01:37:02,630 --> 01:37:04,150
I'm chilling.

2652
01:37:05,770 --> 01:37:07,390
I'm touching point, fighting DPS.

2653
01:37:08,210 --> 01:37:08,590
I'm point.

2654
01:37:09,930 --> 01:37:11,030
I'm trying to.

2655
01:37:11,390 --> 01:37:13,390
There's 20 people in front of me.

2656
01:37:14,330 --> 01:37:15,270
I think it's over.

2657
01:37:19,810 --> 01:37:22,150
You kinda shit on me, I'm not gonna lie.

2658
01:37:22,710 --> 01:37:24,050
Taric, Taric, Taric, buddy.

2659
01:37:24,510 --> 01:37:25,430
We need you to lock in.

2660
01:37:25,430 --> 01:37:26,550
Dude, but I'm not...

2661
01:37:26,550 --> 01:37:29,750
I just realized...

2662
01:37:29,750 --> 01:37:30,230
Listen, listen.

2663
01:37:30,790 --> 01:37:31,890
I have to play.

2664
01:37:32,130 --> 01:37:32,910
I have to play.

2665
01:37:35,010 --> 01:37:36,290
You're going on Groot, bro.

2666
01:37:38,050 --> 01:37:39,370
I wanna try DPS.

2667
01:37:39,530 --> 01:37:40,150
Okay, I'm down, I'm down.

2668
01:37:40,190 --> 01:37:42,390
Can we protect Invisible Woman if possible?

2669
01:37:43,290 --> 01:37:43,690
We can.

2670
01:37:44,510 --> 01:37:45,110
Yeah, we can.

2671
01:37:45,250 --> 01:37:47,950
Their first ban would be Invisible Woman.

2672
01:37:47,950 --> 01:37:50,190
Maybe they won't first ban it again, you know.

2673
01:37:50,490 --> 01:37:51,470
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2674
01:37:51,470 --> 01:37:52,470
Yeah.

2675
01:38:03,910 --> 01:38:05,990
I also play DPS if needed.

2676
01:38:08,410 --> 01:38:11,710
But like, my best DPS is Psylocke.

2677
01:38:20,830 --> 01:38:22,450
Healers need to help each other.

2678
01:38:22,490 --> 01:38:22,730
Yeah.

2679
01:38:24,130 --> 01:38:25,490
I can't.

2680
01:38:25,890 --> 01:38:28,610
The thing is, he's playing Hawkeye.

2681
01:38:29,330 --> 01:38:31,290
You can't do anything against a...

2682
01:38:32,150 --> 01:38:35,290
You can't do anything against headshots.

2683
01:38:35,290 --> 01:38:38,290
A healer can't heal a one-shot.

2684
01:38:38,810 --> 01:38:40,090
So then I was like...

2685
01:38:40,090 --> 01:38:40,690
Am I getting my DPS?

2686
01:38:40,690 --> 01:38:42,370
I don't know, I'm just being flexible.

2687
01:38:43,110 --> 01:38:43,630
In general.

2688
01:38:44,730 --> 01:38:46,470
I'm just being incredibly flexible.

2689
01:38:51,130 --> 01:38:53,290
I think these are gonna...

2690
01:38:54,630 --> 01:38:56,710
It's just RNG randomized.

2691
01:38:59,750 --> 01:39:01,270
It's just like...

2692
01:39:01,270 --> 01:39:02,750
RNG randomized.

2693
01:39:02,750 --> 01:39:04,250
I think like...

2694
01:39:04,250 --> 01:39:06,930
I just got like...

2695
01:39:06,930 --> 01:39:08,750
It's just unfortunate because like...

2696
01:39:09,310 --> 01:39:10,810
There's a lot of support players.

2697
01:39:12,950 --> 01:39:15,010
I'm trying to be as flexible as I can.

2698
01:39:18,270 --> 01:39:21,770
Hawkeye's not that strong in higher ELO.

2699
01:39:22,490 --> 01:39:24,810
But when you have one tank player...

2700
01:39:24,810 --> 01:39:26,270
It's really hard.

2701
01:39:26,530 --> 01:39:28,830
It's so easy against...

2702
01:39:28,830 --> 01:39:30,530
If you have one tank player...

2703
01:39:30,530 --> 01:39:32,950
Hawkeye can farm so easily...

2704
01:39:32,950 --> 01:39:34,150
Against us because of it.

2705
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:42,680
Yeah, so like...

2706
01:39:42,680 --> 01:39:45,340
All they have to do is just dive our...

2707
01:39:45,860 --> 01:39:47,100
Our single tank.

2708
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:48,960
And he can't do anything about it.

2709
01:39:49,620 --> 01:39:51,320
Like I'm willing to flex anything...

2710
01:39:51,320 --> 01:39:51,720
But a tank.

2711
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:53,740
If I put on a tank, I'm just gonna fucking...

2712
01:39:53,740 --> 01:39:56,480
I'm just feeding.

2713
01:39:57,260 --> 01:39:58,720
You can't target Brand's Shroud.

2714
01:39:59,220 --> 01:40:00,960
He's flexible on...

2715
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:03,500
He has a lot of flexibility on DPS.

2716
01:40:04,200 --> 01:40:05,100
It's just target Brand...

2717
01:40:05,100 --> 01:40:06,220
Is like best DPS.

2718
01:40:06,360 --> 01:40:07,660
So we don't have to deal with that shit.

2719
01:40:09,480 --> 01:40:10,040
I'm just...

2720
01:40:10,040 --> 01:40:11,360
I'm just trying my best.

2721
01:40:11,640 --> 01:40:13,800
I'm just...

2722
01:40:15,260 --> 01:40:17,400
I'm just trying my best.

2723
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:17,960
Honestly, you can.

2724
01:40:18,260 --> 01:40:19,080
You just need some damage.

2725
01:40:19,180 --> 01:40:20,460
That's not Taric dying off cooldown.

2726
01:40:24,420 --> 01:40:25,820
He plays Starlord.

2727
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:26,580
He plays Storm.

2728
01:40:26,980 --> 01:40:27,900
He plays Hawkeye.

2729
01:40:28,040 --> 01:40:28,480
He plays Hella.

2730
01:40:28,480 --> 01:40:30,100
I mean, nothing different.

2731
01:40:35,780 --> 01:40:42,340
I don't like playing tank.

2732
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:43,180
It's not fun.

2733
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:45,220
Tank is not fun.

2734
01:40:45,500 --> 01:40:47,040
I wanna play DPS right now.

2735
01:40:47,060 --> 01:40:48,280
Wait, wait, wait.

2736
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:50,400
I don't know.

2737
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:51,500
What map?

2738
01:40:51,620 --> 01:40:52,440
Didn't you choose a map?

2739
01:40:53,960 --> 01:40:56,000
I'm just waiting for the bathroom to be back, guys.

2740
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:05,660
Guys, we can do this.

2741
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:06,840
We could.

2742
01:41:07,240 --> 01:41:07,720
We can.

2743
01:41:09,400 --> 01:41:12,560
I have a crazy plan here that will be really stupid.

2744
01:41:13,300 --> 01:41:16,340
What if we go 3 tanks, 3 supports?

2745
01:41:19,400 --> 01:41:20,460
Whatever it takes.

2746
01:41:21,100 --> 01:41:23,300
Is it just because you don't want Taric to die?

2747
01:41:23,900 --> 01:41:24,500
I give up.

2748
01:41:24,540 --> 01:41:25,680
You guys do whatever you think is best.

2749
01:41:27,700 --> 01:41:29,820
I play a really good...

2750
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:31,760
Groot DPS.

2751
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:35,840
DPS Groot.

2752
01:41:36,200 --> 01:41:37,740
What map do we play, guys?

2753
01:41:38,100 --> 01:41:39,080
I need to just choose something.

2754
01:41:40,300 --> 01:41:41,820
Any favorite maps?

2755
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:45,660
Any good picks here?

2756
01:41:46,140 --> 01:41:46,940
I'll just pick something.

2757
01:41:59,490 --> 01:42:00,650
I'm back.

2758
01:42:01,010 --> 01:42:05,870
I might just cleanse myself after this by playing rank.

2759
01:42:12,950 --> 01:42:13,950
I'm back.

2760
01:42:22,430 --> 01:42:23,470
It's just like...

2761
01:42:24,110 --> 01:42:27,630
It's unfortunate because the thing about my row is that I'm the only support.

2762
01:42:27,810 --> 01:42:29,430
I'm in the same tier as Shroud.

2763
01:42:32,810 --> 01:42:35,930
I'm on the same tier as Shroud for the row for people.

2764
01:42:36,310 --> 01:42:37,790
So I feel like...

2765
01:42:37,790 --> 01:42:38,990
I feel really bad.

2766
01:42:39,450 --> 01:42:43,830
I feel really bad because tier-wise, I'm like...

2767
01:42:43,830 --> 01:42:48,090
being put in the same skill range as Shroud.

2768
01:42:48,650 --> 01:42:51,290
And obviously, since he's a DPS player...

2769
01:42:56,590 --> 01:42:59,610
As a support player, I'm sorry.

2770
01:42:59,690 --> 01:43:00,890
I can't match that.

2771
01:43:08,510 --> 01:43:11,130
So I feel bad because then I'm...

2772
01:43:11,830 --> 01:43:14,070
They got Shroud and then this team got me.

2773
01:43:21,460 --> 01:43:22,560
He called you European.

2774
01:43:22,640 --> 01:43:23,200
You're gonna take that?

2775
01:43:24,820 --> 01:43:26,020
You're gonna take that shit?

2776
01:43:26,240 --> 01:43:26,760
Personally, I wouldn't.

2777
01:43:26,840 --> 01:43:27,440
But that's just me.

2778
01:43:28,060 --> 01:43:29,940
Also, we actually didn't pick first map.

2779
01:43:30,060 --> 01:43:30,580
I was just saying.

2780
01:43:32,520 --> 01:43:33,840
They started it, remember?

2781
01:43:34,720 --> 01:43:35,080
True.

2782
01:43:35,720 --> 01:43:38,060
We probably just didn't know how to pick it.

2783
01:43:38,340 --> 01:43:39,580
And then we just picked the same one.

2784
01:43:41,420 --> 01:43:42,020
That's true.

2785
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:48,160
Again?

2786
01:43:48,160 --> 01:43:48,200
Again?

2787
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:49,160
Again?

2788
01:43:54,220 --> 01:43:55,420
It doesn't matter!

2789
01:43:56,060 --> 01:43:57,500
Just let us play!

2790
01:43:58,540 --> 01:43:59,100
Please!

2791
01:43:59,980 --> 01:44:01,140
I just wanna play.

2792
01:44:02,120 --> 01:44:07,120
Dude, I bet you everyone's gonna be waiting for us just watching our game.

2793
01:44:07,580 --> 01:44:08,700
I think they're probably all done already.

2794
01:44:13,180 --> 01:44:14,720
Just type it out.

2795
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:16,400
Just tell them to type it out.

2796
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:18,280
They don't have to remake it.

2797
01:44:26,450 --> 01:44:28,330
Or is it because they want to play another map?

2798
01:44:32,540 --> 01:44:33,440
Okay, good talk.

2799
01:44:46,640 --> 01:44:47,680
He's saying Koth.

2800
01:44:49,240 --> 01:44:50,400
That's it, I'm playing Koth.

2801
01:44:54,700 --> 01:44:56,240
Okay, it's remake time.

2802
01:44:56,400 --> 01:44:57,060
I'm leaving.

2803
01:45:03,020 --> 01:45:05,840
Alright, time to remake.

2804
01:45:16,790 --> 01:45:18,210
What a fucked up day.

2805
01:45:19,030 --> 01:45:20,690
I still don't have my Discord overlay.

2806
01:45:22,490 --> 01:45:25,690
What a fucked up day.

2807
01:45:25,690 --> 01:45:26,390
Oh, you know what?

2808
01:45:26,430 --> 01:45:27,350
I was so sad.

2809
01:45:27,770 --> 01:45:30,530
When I got home, there was snow.

2810
01:45:31,510 --> 01:45:34,610
I was like, Yippee!

2811
01:45:34,790 --> 01:45:36,950
I'm leaving Seporo!

2812
01:45:37,370 --> 01:45:40,370
I don't have to deal with snow anymore.

2813
01:45:40,990 --> 01:45:47,090
And then I arrived, and I saw snow on the airfield.

2814
01:45:47,690 --> 01:45:49,970
I was like, what a fucked up day.

2815
01:45:57,570 --> 01:45:58,930
That was...

2816
01:46:00,210 --> 01:46:05,130
No, they're gonna change it later.

2817
01:46:12,770 --> 01:46:16,950
Yeah, you have a long time before we actually start.

2818
01:46:17,210 --> 01:46:19,150
Maybe we're gonna restart another lobby too.

2819
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:31,180
Yeah, the snow was so rough.

2820
01:46:31,280 --> 01:46:32,360
I was tired.

2821
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:39,180
I was like, I can't wait to not see snow.

2822
01:46:40,700 --> 01:46:44,860
And then I saw snow, and I was like, what a fucked up day.

2823
01:47:08,370 --> 01:47:10,450
I did talk a little bit about the trip.

2824
01:47:15,580 --> 01:47:17,120
I did talk a little bit.

2825
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:20,120
The trip was...

2826
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:26,740
It was fun.

2827
01:47:27,540 --> 01:47:30,400
Sorry, my brain is so fried right now.

2828
01:47:33,880 --> 01:47:34,720
I'm sick.

2829
01:47:35,120 --> 01:47:39,880
I caught a cold on the last day.

2830
01:47:40,020 --> 01:47:45,260
I'm surprised I was able to rank up as much as I did last night, because I was playing sick as well.

2831
01:47:45,260 --> 01:47:47,400
Technically, I'm sick right now as well.

2832
01:47:47,500 --> 01:47:53,400
I caught a cold on literally the day I leave.

2833
01:47:53,500 --> 01:47:53,920
Yeah, I'm ready.

2834
01:47:54,380 --> 01:47:57,820
I was like, oh my god.

2835
01:47:58,820 --> 01:48:01,360
Everything is not going for doki.

2836
01:48:03,440 --> 01:48:04,800
I survived.

2837
01:48:05,320 --> 01:48:10,320
I survived for so long until literally the last day.

2838
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:11,480
Everyone was sick.

2839
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,320
I heard a lot of players were sick.

2840
01:48:14,420 --> 01:48:17,120
A lot of coaches and staff were sick.

2841
01:48:18,300 --> 01:48:22,680
The audience members were sick.

2842
01:48:28,600 --> 01:48:30,120
It was...

2843
01:48:30,120 --> 01:48:35,820
I woke up on the last day and I was like...

2844
01:48:35,820 --> 01:48:36,900
I can't play the game.

2845
01:48:39,500 --> 01:48:41,300
Half my heroes are just blocked.

2846
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:45,000
We can ban Hawkeye as well.

2847
01:48:47,460 --> 01:48:51,420
It came back and I'm blowing my nose.

2848
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:53,840
I literally had no voice when I woke up today.

2849
01:48:54,920 --> 01:48:57,340
I could not talk today when I woke up.

2850
01:49:00,980 --> 01:49:04,180
I had to make some warm tea.

2851
01:49:05,720 --> 01:49:11,680
I had to make some warm tea and get the Chinese medicine.

2852
01:49:12,660 --> 01:49:13,680
That's like blackish.

2853
01:49:18,600 --> 01:49:23,620
While you guys are comfortable, I'll just flex.

2854
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:25,780
But not on tank.

2855
01:49:25,880 --> 01:49:26,700
I fucking hate tank.

2856
01:49:26,780 --> 01:49:27,540
I'm sorry, Bulger.

2857
01:49:28,420 --> 01:49:28,900
It's okay.

2858
01:49:29,040 --> 01:49:29,280
I get it.

2859
01:49:29,420 --> 01:49:30,160
I get it.

2860
01:49:34,520 --> 01:49:35,260
Taric, listen.

2861
01:49:35,380 --> 01:49:38,080
I chose this map because it's one of the best group maps.

2862
01:49:38,320 --> 01:49:39,460
Do not disappoint me, okay?

2863
01:49:39,460 --> 01:49:40,140
Okay.

2864
01:49:41,820 --> 01:49:42,620
I can't hear him.

2865
01:49:42,700 --> 01:49:42,880
Hello?

2866
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:43,220
Voices?

2867
01:49:43,800 --> 01:49:47,500
I think he chose to ignore you.

2868
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:52,360
You gotta pick up your IGL or he's not gonna acknowledge you.

2869
01:49:55,260 --> 01:49:56,340
I can't.

2870
01:49:56,340 --> 01:49:57,860
I can't.

2871
01:49:57,860 --> 01:50:00,280
I can't IGL.

2872
01:50:01,120 --> 01:50:01,480
Taric.

2873
01:50:03,160 --> 01:50:04,860
I can't IGL.

2874
01:50:04,940 --> 01:50:05,960
I can't.

2875
01:50:06,980 --> 01:50:08,520
I can't IGL.

2876
01:50:10,980 --> 01:50:12,020
I can't IGL.

2877
01:50:12,020 --> 01:50:13,380
Then say it during the match.

2878
01:50:13,480 --> 01:50:14,220
Don't say it after.

2879
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:15,520
Don't be a hindsight Harry.

2880
01:50:15,620 --> 01:50:16,040
You hear me?

2881
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:18,260
I fucking hate hindsight Harry.

2882
01:50:18,720 --> 01:50:20,280
Say Taric stop dying so early.

2883
01:50:20,380 --> 01:50:21,120
What the fuck are you doing?

2884
01:50:21,200 --> 01:50:24,580
I know after I'm dying early, dude.

2885
01:50:24,760 --> 01:50:25,620
I know.

2886
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:26,260
I agree.

2887
01:50:26,380 --> 01:50:27,940
But during the moment, I'm just playing.

2888
01:50:28,300 --> 01:50:29,560
Guys, we're a team.

2889
01:50:29,720 --> 01:50:30,740
We're not fucking team.

2890
01:50:31,020 --> 01:50:32,040
Come on, guys.

2891
01:50:32,040 --> 01:50:33,860
We're a team.

2892
01:50:34,140 --> 01:50:34,920
He's out.

2893
01:50:35,360 --> 01:50:37,480
He's never gonna see Bogre again.

2894
01:50:38,660 --> 01:50:40,360
I'm not actually blaming you, Taric.

2895
01:50:40,680 --> 01:50:42,420
I was doing it for views.

2896
01:50:42,520 --> 01:50:42,980
Let's focus up here.

2897
01:50:43,360 --> 01:50:44,560
Focus up here.

2898
01:50:44,660 --> 01:50:44,980
Focus up here.

2899
01:50:47,320 --> 01:50:47,800
Taric.

2900
01:50:49,060 --> 01:50:49,540
Alright.

2901
01:50:49,880 --> 01:50:50,800
Let's count his deaths, guys.

2902
01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:53,700
Bogre, you bought us, right?

2903
01:50:53,700 --> 01:50:54,440
What the hell?

2904
01:50:55,720 --> 01:50:56,760
It's not for you guys.

2905
01:50:56,760 --> 01:50:57,020
Okay.

2906
01:51:02,040 --> 01:51:03,080
Damn, we gotta kill them.

2907
01:51:03,440 --> 01:51:04,860
I'm dead.

2908
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:06,680
You're so alive.

2909
01:51:06,900 --> 01:51:07,480
You're so healthy.

2910
01:51:07,620 --> 01:51:09,360
You're so healthy.

2911
01:51:09,580 --> 01:51:10,180
Look at you go.

2912
01:51:11,220 --> 01:51:12,240
We have lamps here in the back.

2913
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:13,060
I'm crushing.

2914
01:51:13,820 --> 01:51:14,580
Mag low.

2915
01:51:15,380 --> 01:51:15,940
I'm on.

2916
01:51:17,160 --> 01:51:18,420
I'm trying my best to keep you up.

2917
01:51:20,240 --> 01:51:21,800
I need heals too.

2918
01:51:22,160 --> 01:51:23,040
Wait, Taric.

2919
01:51:23,700 --> 01:51:25,120
We gotta kill here.

2920
01:51:25,680 --> 01:51:26,480
Heal me up.

2921
01:51:28,920 --> 01:51:30,180
I need juice.

2922
01:51:31,540 --> 01:51:33,280
I need heals too in the back here.

2923
01:51:33,320 --> 01:51:34,440
We're getting up.

2924
01:51:35,020 --> 01:51:38,420
I might have to swap.

2925
01:51:39,400 --> 01:51:41,140
Maybe we go inside here with a group.

2926
01:51:41,340 --> 01:51:42,220
Come left.

2927
01:51:43,580 --> 01:51:44,700
Okay, nice.

2928
01:51:46,340 --> 01:51:46,800
Come inside.

2929
01:51:47,180 --> 01:51:48,840
Come inside.

2930
01:51:49,720 --> 01:51:50,480
Kill him, badumais.

2931
01:51:51,820 --> 01:51:52,700
Give me the ult.

2932
01:51:53,300 --> 01:51:53,620
Wait.

2933
01:51:54,920 --> 01:51:56,460
Oh, I'm dead, boy.

2934
01:52:06,300 --> 01:52:07,300
All good.

2935
01:52:08,940 --> 01:52:10,800
We can invis ult first.

2936
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:12,220
Okay, I'll ult.

2937
01:52:12,540 --> 01:52:17,360
We can invisible woman ult every ult in the game, basically.

2938
01:52:17,360 --> 01:52:18,680
Where exactly do you want me to ult?

2939
01:52:18,720 --> 01:52:19,240
On site?

2940
01:52:20,300 --> 01:52:26,920
You gotta be able to shield her with invisible woman though because that Mag's gonna fucking chuck the rock at her.

2941
01:52:26,920 --> 01:52:27,800
I'm taking a lot of damage from them here.

2942
01:52:29,100 --> 01:52:29,780
Ike, she's coming.

2943
01:52:29,940 --> 01:52:30,980
You watch me.

2944
01:52:31,680 --> 01:52:32,700
Yeah, we're playing this.

2945
01:52:32,940 --> 01:52:34,840
Alright, here we go.

2946
01:52:36,340 --> 01:52:37,980
Watch out, he's gonna go in any second now.

2947
01:52:38,080 --> 01:52:38,800
I can shield this.

2948
01:52:38,980 --> 01:52:39,760
Nice, shoot it.

2949
01:52:40,080 --> 01:52:40,260
Shoot it.

2950
01:52:42,140 --> 01:52:42,460
I'm done.

2951
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:46,880
Kill the thing.

2952
01:52:47,640 --> 01:52:47,920
It's fine.

2953
01:52:49,040 --> 01:52:49,560
I got you.

2954
01:52:51,100 --> 01:52:52,340
I'm gonna ult in here.

2955
01:52:53,320 --> 01:52:54,100
We got one.

2956
01:52:55,580 --> 01:52:55,980
Nice.

2957
01:52:56,540 --> 01:52:57,640
I'm gonna go in with this.

2958
01:52:58,300 --> 01:53:00,260
I have to go in with this.

2959
01:53:00,520 --> 01:53:01,060
Play with me.

2960
01:53:01,900 --> 01:53:03,000
I'm not good at all.

2961
01:53:07,560 --> 01:53:08,520
I'm coming.

2962
01:53:09,940 --> 01:53:11,060
I need a little health here.

2963
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:14,380
I can't keep you up.

2964
01:53:15,120 --> 01:53:16,460
I think we play back now.

2965
01:53:16,580 --> 01:53:17,020
Everyone's dead.

2966
01:53:17,400 --> 01:53:19,360
We have to play a point this last second.

2967
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:20,580
You're right.

2968
01:53:21,820 --> 01:53:23,200
It might be cocked.

2969
01:53:23,220 --> 01:53:24,720
It might just be Jover.

2970
01:53:29,940 --> 01:53:30,260
Oh.

2971
01:53:31,180 --> 01:53:32,000
Can you get back in or no?

2972
01:53:32,340 --> 01:53:33,160
I'm heading over.

2973
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:35,640
Emily has to touch this.

2974
01:53:36,840 --> 01:53:37,400
Nice try.

2975
01:53:37,960 --> 01:53:38,600
It's fine.

2976
01:53:38,980 --> 01:53:40,720
I think next one's gonna be better.

2977
01:53:40,860 --> 01:53:41,100
It's fine.

2978
01:53:41,860 --> 01:53:42,700
That one felt worse.

2979
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:43,300
I'm not gonna lie.

2980
01:53:43,380 --> 01:53:43,860
That one felt worse.

2981
01:53:43,860 --> 01:53:44,660
You can swap.

2982
01:53:44,740 --> 01:53:45,400
You don't have to play Groot.

2983
01:53:45,740 --> 01:53:46,300
Just play whatever.

2984
01:53:46,700 --> 01:53:47,040
It doesn't matter.

2985
01:53:47,820 --> 01:53:49,000
No, I BurgerEye tilted you.

2986
01:53:49,020 --> 01:53:49,600
I'm sorry, bro.

2987
01:53:49,740 --> 01:53:50,520
No, I'm not tilted.

2988
01:53:50,720 --> 01:53:51,440
I was just playing with you.

2989
01:53:54,960 --> 01:53:55,660
It's 4 AM.

2990
01:53:55,820 --> 01:53:56,340
I'm not tilted.

2991
01:53:56,440 --> 01:53:57,460
I was just playing with you, bro.

2992
01:53:57,460 --> 01:53:58,360
I was bantering.

2993
01:53:58,500 --> 01:53:59,660
I didn't know if you were upset or not.

2994
01:53:59,680 --> 01:54:00,800
Oh, no, Burger.

2995
01:54:00,940 --> 01:54:01,980
You can't be tired.

2996
01:54:02,160 --> 01:54:03,880
I have you as my teammate against you.

2997
01:54:05,420 --> 01:54:06,240
Okay, listen.

2998
01:54:07,760 --> 01:54:10,140
I'll be completely honest, guys.

2999
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:10,960
Look in.

3000
01:54:11,700 --> 01:54:12,400
That's my call.

3001
01:54:14,100 --> 01:54:14,820
I got you.

3002
01:54:15,020 --> 01:54:16,520
You can play Hella if you want.

3003
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:17,920
No, we're good like this.

3004
01:54:18,060 --> 01:54:18,240
You're good.

3005
01:54:23,440 --> 01:54:25,900
Just to be clear, it was my chat that tilted me.

3006
01:54:25,900 --> 01:54:27,640
I wasn't tilted.

3007
01:54:27,880 --> 01:54:29,660
Wait, you hate your chat?

3008
01:54:29,940 --> 01:54:30,560
That's fucked up.

3009
01:54:31,140 --> 01:54:32,980
Oh my god, you hate your chat?

3010
01:54:33,660 --> 01:54:34,740
Oh my god.

3011
01:54:35,020 --> 01:54:35,700
He hates you.

3012
01:54:35,880 --> 01:54:36,520
Remember that.

3013
01:54:37,200 --> 01:54:37,980
He hates you.

3014
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:40,900
And you're gonna still give him money.

3015
01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:50,100
Where they at?

3016
01:54:52,060 --> 01:54:53,740
We stay up.

3017
01:54:53,740 --> 01:54:55,040
I'm gonna drop, actually.

3018
01:54:55,160 --> 01:54:55,820
I'm gonna poke them here.

3019
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:56,880
But you stay up.

3020
01:54:58,140 --> 01:54:58,540
Nice.

3021
01:55:01,300 --> 01:55:02,060
Oh, okay.

3022
01:55:02,160 --> 01:55:02,700
Not nice.

3023
01:55:03,720 --> 01:55:04,780
They got us real good.

3024
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:05,480
We're not there.

3025
01:55:05,500 --> 01:55:06,140
We're not there at all.

3026
01:55:07,540 --> 01:55:07,940
Nice.

3027
01:55:08,100 --> 01:55:08,640
Nice, Burger.

3028
01:55:09,080 --> 01:55:10,380
Thank you, Burger.

3029
01:55:11,020 --> 01:55:11,640
Heal Burger.

3030
01:55:12,880 --> 01:55:13,480
I'm healing.

3031
01:55:15,600 --> 01:55:17,260
I'm dying here, but I'm healing.

3032
01:55:20,480 --> 01:55:21,080
I'm coming.

3033
01:55:21,080 --> 01:55:21,980
I dropped down.

3034
01:55:22,280 --> 01:55:23,920
Are you alive?

3035
01:55:24,600 --> 01:55:26,700
Oh no, we don't have heal supports now.

3036
01:55:29,580 --> 01:55:30,580
Penny one, penny one.

3037
01:55:30,820 --> 01:55:31,460
We're coming, we're coming.

3038
01:55:34,580 --> 01:55:36,380
I'm gonna drop C for you, Taric.

3039
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:38,480
I'm coming back.

3040
01:55:38,920 --> 01:55:40,000
No one has point yet.

3041
01:55:41,180 --> 01:55:41,640
Did you rez?

3042
01:55:42,340 --> 01:55:43,140
No, I didn't rez.

3043
01:55:45,500 --> 01:55:47,460
We gotta shoot that if we can.

3044
01:55:48,060 --> 01:55:49,520
I can't shoot that.

3045
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:54,640
Let's regroup.

3046
01:55:54,820 --> 01:55:55,700
I think we're split up right now.

3047
01:55:57,900 --> 01:55:59,640
I'll just pretend to be a clone.

3048
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:01,360
They'll never know.

3049
01:56:02,260 --> 01:56:02,500
Mhm.

3050
01:56:09,440 --> 01:56:10,160
I have rocket ult.

3051
01:56:13,800 --> 01:56:14,840
I'm scaling, I'm scaling.

3052
01:56:15,840 --> 01:56:16,900
Move up together, move up together.

3053
01:56:18,740 --> 01:56:19,600
They're gonna go in.

3054
01:56:19,940 --> 01:56:20,700
I'm pushing this, I'm pushing.

3055
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:23,240
They're all low, they're all low.

3056
01:56:24,500 --> 01:56:25,460
Okay, I got involved.

3057
01:56:25,460 --> 01:56:27,180
Yeah, push this up.

3058
01:56:27,220 --> 01:56:27,620
Push, push.

3059
01:56:28,760 --> 01:56:30,200
I'm not gonna use ult yet.

3060
01:56:31,300 --> 01:56:32,300
Ducky, we need it in a bit.

3061
01:56:32,680 --> 01:56:34,240
Yeah, where's the invisible boy, man?

3062
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:36,080
I need help, I need help.

3063
01:56:37,060 --> 01:56:38,420
In the backline, I got you.

3064
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:42,700
Playing that, playing that.

3065
01:56:43,560 --> 01:56:45,020
Kill squirrel, squirrel, squirrel.

3066
01:56:46,420 --> 01:56:47,140
In the front, guys.

3067
01:56:47,300 --> 01:56:47,980
They're all over there.

3068
01:56:48,820 --> 01:56:49,880
I'm low, I'm low on the right.

3069
01:56:50,820 --> 01:56:51,280
I'm low on the right.

3070
01:56:51,280 --> 01:56:53,600
No, I'm not.

3071
01:56:54,800 --> 01:56:55,500
I'm coming back with ult.

3072
01:56:57,040 --> 01:56:57,480
Nice kill.

3073
01:56:57,740 --> 01:56:59,340
I'm coming back, map change, map change.

3074
01:56:59,680 --> 01:57:00,700
We have a rescue team.

3075
01:57:00,980 --> 01:57:02,220
Mag's low, mag's low.

3076
01:57:02,500 --> 01:57:04,340
I'm ulting, I'm ulting.

3077
01:57:04,980 --> 01:57:05,740
I'm shielding you.

3078
01:57:06,820 --> 01:57:08,300
Yeah, I'm healing you.

3079
01:57:20,060 --> 01:57:20,820
Penny on me.

3080
01:57:21,820 --> 01:57:22,500
I'm dying here.

3081
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:25,600
I give you invuln, I give you invuln here.

3082
01:57:26,320 --> 01:57:27,700
Penny low, penny half.

3083
01:57:27,700 --> 01:57:29,360
That's huge, that's huge, that's huge.

3084
01:57:29,880 --> 01:57:32,580
I'm trying to keep you up right now.

3085
01:57:33,260 --> 01:57:34,060
Reloading here.

3086
01:57:34,780 --> 01:57:35,520
I can't.

3087
01:57:35,940 --> 01:57:37,780
I'm low, I'm low in the backline.

3088
01:57:39,900 --> 01:57:40,500
Squirrel low.

3089
01:57:42,200 --> 01:57:43,040
I got one, squirrel low.

3090
01:57:44,520 --> 01:57:46,420
You're up two, you're up two right now.

3091
01:57:46,660 --> 01:57:46,820
Strange, strange.

3092
01:57:47,500 --> 01:57:48,300
Strange low, strange low.

3093
01:57:49,600 --> 01:57:50,140
Strange low, dead.

3094
01:57:51,840 --> 01:57:52,500
Penny above.

3095
01:57:53,300 --> 01:57:54,020
I cannot help.

3096
01:57:54,020 --> 01:57:55,080
Penny's on me, penny on me.

3097
01:57:55,780 --> 01:57:56,780
I'm dead, I'm dead.

3098
01:57:56,940 --> 01:57:59,880
I have invuln here, but...

3099
01:57:59,880 --> 01:58:00,500
Penny one, penny one.

3100
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:02,900
I'm gonna die, I think.

3101
01:58:03,500 --> 01:58:04,160
I'm dead.

3102
01:58:05,100 --> 01:58:06,580
But I can't get on point.

3103
01:58:09,680 --> 01:58:11,460
They had the point that whole time.

3104
01:58:11,740 --> 01:58:12,140
Yeah.

3105
01:58:15,360 --> 01:58:17,000
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

3106
01:58:17,540 --> 01:58:18,600
It's my fault, guys.

3107
01:58:19,060 --> 01:58:20,160
It's not your fault, man.

3108
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:21,540
I don't feel bad, dude.

3109
01:58:21,600 --> 01:58:23,880
It's my fault, guys.

3110
01:58:24,600 --> 01:58:25,840
I'll do better next time.

3111
01:58:27,120 --> 01:58:29,120
I hope so, because I'm still on your team.

3112
01:58:30,820 --> 01:58:32,400
At least Tariq won't be on our team.

3113
01:58:32,940 --> 01:58:39,320
Listen, I will take responsibility, I will take responsibility for these losses.

3114
01:58:40,100 --> 01:58:41,960
And that's okay, and that's okay.

3115
01:58:43,300 --> 01:58:45,460
Hey, at least we had fun, right guys?

3116
01:58:45,720 --> 01:58:45,960
No.

3117
01:58:49,240 --> 01:58:50,360
He said it, not me, bro.

3118
01:58:50,480 --> 01:58:51,240
He said it, not me.

3119
01:58:52,060 --> 01:58:54,100
He's here to win the skins, Tariq.

3120
01:58:54,380 --> 01:58:55,980
We're just here to vibe.

3121
01:58:56,320 --> 01:58:57,140
I need the skins badly.

3122
01:58:57,580 --> 01:58:59,040
I need the skins, I need the skins.

3123
01:58:59,140 --> 01:58:59,460
I'm addicted.

3124
01:58:59,660 --> 01:59:00,000
I need them.

3125
01:59:00,920 --> 01:59:03,520
He was an Overwatch streamer, he really needs the skins.

3126
01:59:03,680 --> 01:59:04,680
I love skins, I love skins.

3127
01:59:08,950 --> 01:59:09,710
Alright, guys.

3128
01:59:10,450 --> 01:59:12,750
We're still playing.

3129
01:59:13,250 --> 01:59:17,730
I felt like I was fucking fighting my life with 1 HP all the time.

3130
01:59:19,250 --> 01:59:21,670
I felt like I had to heal.

3131
01:59:23,770 --> 01:59:26,070
Tariq, we're playing against you next game, but your team is stacked.

3132
01:59:26,170 --> 01:59:26,830
I'll be honest with you.

3133
01:59:27,250 --> 01:59:28,330
Oh, we're gonna fuck you.

3134
01:59:28,690 --> 01:59:31,930
Bro, you have Shroud, you have Shroud, X, and Selene.

3135
01:59:32,490 --> 01:59:34,610
And we're not gonna hold back either.

3136
01:59:34,870 --> 01:59:36,610
Were you sandbagging this?

3137
01:59:37,370 --> 01:59:37,690
Yeah.

3138
01:59:38,090 --> 01:59:39,370
I was setting myself up for this.

3139
01:59:39,710 --> 01:59:40,230
Okay, okay.

3140
01:59:45,540 --> 01:59:47,480
Yeah, it's been...

3141
01:59:47,900 --> 01:59:51,760
Guys, I just need you to know, the next three games...

3142
01:59:51,760 --> 01:59:53,060
Tariq, Mike said you're scared.

3143
01:59:53,240 --> 01:59:54,460
Mostly support players as well.

3144
01:59:54,480 --> 01:59:55,440
I'm not scared of him, dude.

3145
01:59:55,520 --> 01:59:56,600
I 1v1 him on that one.

3146
01:59:56,700 --> 01:59:56,700
He said you're scared.

3147
01:59:56,780 --> 01:59:58,640
He came in here, he said, Tariq's scared.

3148
01:59:59,140 --> 01:59:59,820
Scared of what?

3149
02:00:00,400 --> 02:00:01,640
We're in for a ride.

3150
02:00:01,940 --> 02:00:04,580
Trust me, I'm not scared.

3151
02:00:04,760 --> 02:00:05,600
Check how many times I died.

3152
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:08,060
Alright, I'm checking.

3153
02:00:12,390 --> 02:00:13,710
That's what I'm saying.

3154
02:00:14,010 --> 02:00:15,530
It's been a fucked up month.

3155
02:00:15,670 --> 02:00:19,190
My RNG has been actually the worst it's ever been.

3156
02:00:19,910 --> 02:00:22,110
Guys, the moment...

3157
02:00:22,110 --> 02:00:23,390
I think...

3158
02:00:23,390 --> 02:00:25,810
The year of the sneak has not started well for me.

3159
02:00:26,630 --> 02:00:27,690
Good luck, good luck, good luck.

3160
02:00:27,790 --> 02:00:30,250
Good luck, good luck, good luck.

3161
02:00:33,270 --> 02:00:34,370
Doki, doki, doki.

3162
02:00:34,470 --> 02:00:36,050
The year of the sneak has not been great.

3163
02:00:36,970 --> 02:00:39,190
Buck 50 with your doki, we're not winning the last game.

3164
02:00:39,410 --> 02:00:40,270
I know, I know.

3165
02:00:40,350 --> 02:00:42,550
I'm not winning the next three matches, I know.

3166
02:00:42,650 --> 02:00:43,750
I've already accepted that.

3167
02:00:45,470 --> 02:00:46,530
We're so fucked.

3168
02:00:46,550 --> 02:00:48,150
Next one is fucked for all of us.

3169
02:00:48,730 --> 02:00:52,150
Next one is Hydrogen Bomb vs Koffing Baby.

3170
02:00:53,970 --> 02:00:56,470
Wait, can I play DPS then?

3171
02:00:57,010 --> 02:00:57,930
If it's fucked.

3172
02:00:59,430 --> 02:01:00,450
Wait, do we have...

3173
02:01:00,450 --> 02:01:02,610
I think we have DPS players.

3174
02:01:02,810 --> 02:01:03,310
We have DPS players?

3175
02:01:03,350 --> 02:01:04,330
I mean, we have Nora.

3176
02:01:04,590 --> 02:01:05,210
Nora plays DPS.

3177
02:01:05,810 --> 02:01:06,990
Yeah, I'm alright.

3178
02:01:07,970 --> 02:01:09,110
I'm so cooked.

3179
02:01:10,690 --> 02:01:11,430
What if I go DPS?

3180
02:01:12,130 --> 02:01:13,130
Poker, we have no tank players.

3181
02:01:13,170 --> 02:01:14,230
You're literally our only tank.

3182
02:01:15,690 --> 02:01:17,250
Listen, it doesn't matter if I have a tank player.

3183
02:01:17,350 --> 02:01:19,350
If I have Taric dying off cooldown, I'll be real.

3184
02:01:19,470 --> 02:01:20,550
Yeah, but Taric has Shroud.

3185
02:01:20,790 --> 02:01:22,970
He doesn't fucking need...

3186
02:01:22,970 --> 02:01:24,870
He'll just be like the second person.

3187
02:01:25,050 --> 02:01:27,390
If Taric dies, Shroud just clones himself.

3188
02:01:37,520 --> 02:01:38,580
We're all so low.

3189
02:01:39,440 --> 02:01:43,960
I've like accepted it when I saw my matchups.

3190
02:01:50,660 --> 02:01:55,340
I was like, maybe it won't be that bad.

3191
02:01:55,600 --> 02:01:57,020
I was like, oh my god.

3192
02:01:57,120 --> 02:01:59,500
Maybe we can do it with all these support players.

3193
02:01:59,620 --> 02:02:01,600
Doki, Doki, Nora, Nora, Nora.

3194
02:02:02,540 --> 02:02:03,080
Oopsie.

3195
02:02:05,120 --> 02:02:08,540
You're on a team with Sleepy?

3196
02:02:08,540 --> 02:02:11,280
Yeah, but Sleepy is also a support player, guys.

3197
02:02:11,520 --> 02:02:11,840
Guys, I'm a loser.

3198
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:14,840
We also have a team full of support players.

3199
02:02:14,960 --> 02:02:18,320
Can we ban Penny next?

3200
02:02:18,860 --> 02:02:19,500
Oh, 1-1?

3201
02:02:21,260 --> 02:02:24,580
You want to ban Penny with the two Penny mains on your team?

3202
02:02:24,860 --> 02:02:25,740
Wait, what?

3203
02:02:26,640 --> 02:02:29,380
Oh yeah, Poki, I'll just bring this out here.

3204
02:02:30,760 --> 02:02:32,080
Burger's idea too long.

3205
02:02:32,460 --> 02:02:33,180
It wasn't my idea.

3206
02:02:33,620 --> 02:02:34,440
Okay, it was my idea.

3207
02:02:34,480 --> 02:02:34,840
I'll be honest.

3208
02:02:35,280 --> 02:02:35,680
I won't lie.

3209
02:02:35,680 --> 02:02:36,920
Yeah, it was his idea.

3210
02:02:37,180 --> 02:02:38,780
We told him not to do it.

3211
02:02:40,320 --> 02:02:41,640
That's fucked up, man.

3212
02:02:43,500 --> 02:02:45,260
I heard Burger's the sweatiest player here.

3213
02:02:46,960 --> 02:02:51,200
He's literally commanding people like he's a fucking general.

3214
02:02:51,580 --> 02:02:54,280
Oh no, he crashed out last game.

3215
02:02:54,320 --> 02:02:54,860
Don't worry.

3216
02:02:55,280 --> 02:02:56,760
I can't comment.

3217
02:02:56,860 --> 02:02:57,320
Okay, listen.

3218
02:02:57,460 --> 02:02:58,400
That was uncommandable.

3219
02:02:58,560 --> 02:02:59,080
I'll be honest.

3220
02:02:59,680 --> 02:03:01,960
Taric yelled at him and then he crashed out.

3221
02:03:01,960 --> 02:03:04,160
No, that's fucking crazy.

3222
02:03:07,600 --> 02:03:08,860
You're not Burger.

3223
02:03:09,700 --> 02:03:10,700
What did I just add?

3224
02:03:11,940 --> 02:03:13,400
I'm not Burger.

3225
02:03:13,740 --> 02:03:14,620
He's not Burger.

3226
02:03:15,380 --> 02:03:16,660
What's your name in game?

3227
02:03:17,080 --> 02:03:17,700
Not Burger.

3228
02:03:20,520 --> 02:03:21,960
Oh, I added someone else.

3229
02:03:22,160 --> 02:03:24,100
Oh, yeah, you added a random Burger.

3230
02:03:25,020 --> 02:03:25,680
Oh no.

3231
02:03:35,950 --> 02:03:39,590
That's why after this tournament I might play some more.

3232
02:03:39,750 --> 02:03:42,210
I might play like one or two ranked games.

3233
02:03:42,310 --> 02:03:44,390
Actually, I don't want to do solo though.

3234
02:03:44,390 --> 02:03:46,670
I already had a fucked up session.

3235
02:03:57,770 --> 02:03:58,950
I don't know.

3236
02:03:59,110 --> 02:04:01,650
I was already like I need a...

3237
02:04:05,350 --> 02:04:06,230
One or two.

3238
02:04:06,550 --> 02:04:06,910
One or two.

3239
02:04:07,010 --> 02:04:08,570
Oh my god, did I miss something?

3240
02:04:08,750 --> 02:04:09,710
I'm sorry, I was getting food.

3241
02:04:10,170 --> 02:04:11,650
Oh, yeah, Poki, you missed something.

3242
02:04:12,190 --> 02:04:12,550
What's up?

3243
02:04:13,710 --> 02:04:15,570
We were against you last round, right?

3244
02:04:16,350 --> 02:04:16,710
Mm-hmm.

3245
02:04:17,350 --> 02:04:20,450
Burger was the one that demanded we ban Penny.

3246
02:04:20,870 --> 02:04:21,250
That's true.

3247
02:04:21,270 --> 02:04:21,390
I know.

3248
02:04:22,070 --> 02:04:23,070
Yeah, we tried to stop him.

3249
02:04:23,630 --> 02:04:24,350
It was so fucked up.

3250
02:04:24,350 --> 02:04:26,790
Because I faced him first game and he did the same.

3251
02:04:27,870 --> 02:04:29,330
Listen, I'm here to win, Poki.

3252
02:04:29,330 --> 02:04:30,750
I don't want to listen to you.

3253
02:04:30,750 --> 02:04:31,570
You can't blame me.

3254
02:04:31,630 --> 02:04:32,350
I'm here to win, Poki.

3255
02:04:32,470 --> 02:04:34,370
Wait, I thought this was a fun event.

3256
02:04:34,810 --> 02:04:35,750
No, it's not.

3257
02:04:35,870 --> 02:04:36,970
I have fun winning.

3258
02:04:37,910 --> 02:04:38,630
Oh, no.

3259
02:04:41,410 --> 02:04:44,570
By the way, Booger does not believe in us for this matchup.

3260
02:04:44,650 --> 02:04:44,790
There's no peace.

3261
02:04:44,910 --> 02:04:46,490
I banned Penny because I thought it was the right choice.

3262
02:04:46,490 --> 02:04:47,490
He doesn't believe in us?

3263
02:04:47,570 --> 02:04:48,690
No, he was like...

3264
02:04:48,690 --> 02:04:50,570
He literally was like...

3265
02:04:51,910 --> 02:04:53,550
We're not winning this next one.

3266
02:04:53,810 --> 02:04:54,730
I believe in you guys.

3267
02:04:54,970 --> 02:04:57,510
I'm just saying it might be slightly difficult to win this game.

3268
02:04:57,510 --> 02:04:59,390
Yeah, he's already given up.

3269
02:04:59,770 --> 02:05:00,650
We can though.

3270
02:05:00,730 --> 02:05:01,690
I believe we can win.

3271
02:05:02,210 --> 02:05:04,130
Wait, Poki, where are you?

3272
02:05:04,250 --> 02:05:06,070
Because they have a better tank player than us.

3273
02:05:06,210 --> 02:05:06,570
No, I understand.

3274
02:05:06,990 --> 02:05:08,030
Nah, it's cool.

3275
02:05:08,130 --> 02:05:08,630
It's not a big deal.

3276
02:05:09,950 --> 02:05:10,850
I'm crashing out.

3277
02:05:13,530 --> 02:05:14,350
I'm crashing out.

3278
02:05:15,990 --> 02:05:17,390
Yeah, no weak mental.

3279
02:05:17,510 --> 02:05:18,190
We can do it.

3280
02:05:19,470 --> 02:05:20,510
What's our strats?

3281
02:05:22,530 --> 02:05:23,810
We're gonna be concerned.

3282
02:05:24,110 --> 02:05:27,170
We're gonna be concerned about The Shroud.

3283
02:05:27,630 --> 02:05:30,090
The Shroud just wrote Taric last game.

3284
02:05:30,410 --> 02:05:30,810
I'm gonna be honest.

3285
02:05:31,770 --> 02:05:32,590
Who is Ni Hao?

3286
02:05:32,770 --> 02:05:33,650
Do I need to kick this person?

3287
02:05:36,010 --> 02:05:36,730
No, they're...

3288
02:05:36,730 --> 02:05:39,050
I don't remember who they were but they were tank on the last game.

3289
02:05:39,890 --> 02:05:41,070
Yeah, but are they on the enemy team?

3290
02:05:41,190 --> 02:05:42,490
Yeah, they are on the enemy team.

3291
02:05:43,090 --> 02:05:44,410
No, are they now on the enemy team?

3292
02:05:45,350 --> 02:05:46,430
Isn't that Qtpie?

3293
02:05:47,150 --> 02:05:48,290
Yeah, I think we removed Qtpie.

3294
02:05:49,630 --> 02:05:51,290
Yeah, he is on their team.

3295
02:05:51,410 --> 02:05:51,890
Wait, is he?

3296
02:05:53,130 --> 02:05:54,170
No, he's not.

3297
02:05:55,050 --> 02:05:55,650
You should kick him.

3298
02:05:55,890 --> 02:05:56,230
Goodbye Qt.

3299
02:05:58,890 --> 02:06:00,890
But like, if I'm wrong, I'm so sorry.

3300
02:06:01,070 --> 02:06:01,970
You look like the bad guy.

3301
02:06:02,470 --> 02:06:03,330
You are the bad guy.

3302
02:06:03,550 --> 02:06:04,870
It wasn't me.

3303
02:06:08,380 --> 02:06:11,380
I mean, he is the leader at the lobby so everybody can just blame him.

3304
02:06:13,020 --> 02:06:13,420
BogrNation.

3305
02:06:14,420 --> 02:06:16,020
Hi, Bogr, lead us.

3306
02:06:16,400 --> 02:06:16,820
What do we do?

3307
02:06:17,380 --> 02:06:19,640
Okay, I think we ban Groot 100%.

3308
02:06:19,640 --> 02:06:20,960
I just don't want to play against Groot.

3309
02:06:21,420 --> 02:06:22,820
I know what they are going to protect next.

3310
02:06:23,220 --> 02:06:23,840
What do we play?

3311
02:06:23,920 --> 02:06:24,440
We play Penny.

3312
02:06:24,920 --> 02:06:25,680
We play support.

3313
02:06:26,960 --> 02:06:28,060
We have a lot of support players, no?

3314
02:06:29,300 --> 02:06:30,160
No, no one plays DPS.

3315
02:06:31,240 --> 02:06:32,420
I can play anything, though.

3316
02:06:32,500 --> 02:06:33,820
I think we have a lot of DPS players.

3317
02:06:34,180 --> 02:06:35,540
Yeah, okay, we have two Penny players.

3318
02:06:35,620 --> 02:06:37,060
So you guys have to decide who is going to play Penny.

3319
02:06:37,800 --> 02:06:39,860
Wait, I don't really want to play Penny.

3320
02:06:40,180 --> 02:06:41,440
Oh, you don't want to play MrFantastic, though?

3321
02:06:43,540 --> 02:06:44,940
Honestly, listen, we need to...

3322
02:06:44,940 --> 02:06:46,140
I think it might work.

3323
02:06:47,600 --> 02:06:49,300
Here is what I told my team last game.

3324
02:06:49,300 --> 02:06:51,060
Give me one life with MrFantastic.

3325
02:06:51,520 --> 02:06:52,820
And when I die, I'll switch off.

3326
02:06:53,020 --> 02:06:53,700
And we'll play Triple Healer.

3327
02:06:54,620 --> 02:06:56,340
Yeah, so Doki plays support.

3328
02:06:56,660 --> 02:06:57,640
Lulu, are you a support player?

3329
02:06:58,460 --> 02:07:02,360
I can do support or DPS.

3330
02:07:03,260 --> 02:07:05,820
I think we need you on support, probably.

3331
02:07:07,540 --> 02:07:08,940
Who do you need on support?

3332
02:07:09,780 --> 02:07:10,660
Doki, you are a support.

3333
02:07:19,050 --> 02:07:20,470
I'll be on support, Jill.

3334
02:07:21,810 --> 02:07:22,750
Support Jill?

3335
02:07:22,870 --> 02:07:25,210
It's a luxury to play support in this game.

3336
02:07:25,650 --> 02:07:30,150
I can bust out the Punisher, or Moon Knight, or Namor.

3337
02:07:30,310 --> 02:07:30,450
Oh.

3338
02:07:32,250 --> 02:07:33,750
Guys, I wanted to play DPS.

3339
02:07:38,890 --> 02:07:40,070
So, Namor is DPS.

3340
02:07:40,390 --> 02:07:43,010
And then we have minimum one more DPS.

3341
02:07:43,290 --> 02:07:43,890
I'm on support, Jill, because you're like...

3342
02:07:45,010 --> 02:07:46,430
You're the highest-ranked support.

3343
02:07:46,550 --> 02:07:46,990
I don't care.

3344
02:07:48,050 --> 02:07:49,190
You want to random it?

3345
02:07:50,150 --> 02:07:51,750
Something Penny is good on.

3346
02:07:53,650 --> 02:07:54,870
The spooky map.

3347
02:07:55,390 --> 02:07:56,250
The vampire map?

3348
02:07:56,730 --> 02:07:57,110
I know it.

3349
02:07:57,310 --> 02:07:57,910
Midtown, right?

3350
02:07:59,750 --> 02:08:00,610
Midtown, Midtown.

3351
02:08:00,970 --> 02:08:02,350
The one with the little choke at the beginning.

3352
02:08:02,350 --> 02:08:03,370
This one, right?

3353
02:08:04,790 --> 02:08:05,670
Not the new one.

3354
02:08:05,670 --> 02:08:07,510
The vampire map.

3355
02:08:08,430 --> 02:08:10,210
Not the new one, no.

3356
02:08:10,610 --> 02:08:11,390
What spooky map?

3357
02:08:12,770 --> 02:08:13,430
I know which one.

3358
02:08:13,430 --> 02:08:15,490
Booger is already suffering.

3359
02:08:15,690 --> 02:08:17,510
You can't leave him like this.

3360
02:08:18,590 --> 02:08:19,730
That's true.

3361
02:08:20,690 --> 02:08:22,650
No, no, no.

3362
02:08:24,250 --> 02:08:26,390
He's not having a good time.

3363
02:08:26,910 --> 02:08:28,490
What the fuck is this?

3364
02:08:28,950 --> 02:08:29,790
Venom map.

3365
02:08:30,210 --> 02:08:31,690
Yeah, this is the Venom map.

3366
02:08:33,330 --> 02:08:35,190
The symbiote map.

3367
02:08:35,590 --> 02:08:36,270
Glintar.

3368
02:08:36,770 --> 02:08:39,650
Booger and I are both in tank and support, Jill.

3369
02:08:39,950 --> 02:08:40,690
Because he's like...

3370
02:08:40,690 --> 02:08:41,470
I don't know what else to say.

3371
02:08:41,750 --> 02:08:42,430
Okay, I'm just kidding.

3372
02:08:43,370 --> 02:08:45,370
Who needs me to keep him alive?

3373
02:08:51,790 --> 02:08:53,690
This is the same of XTC.

3374
02:08:54,190 --> 02:08:55,870
He's like, no, you don't swap out support.

3375
02:08:56,290 --> 02:08:57,210
I was just like, okay.

3376
02:09:00,710 --> 02:09:04,270
It's not Glintar, for sure.

3377
02:09:07,210 --> 02:09:08,510
The Tokyo map?

3378
02:09:08,510 --> 02:09:09,570
Maybe.

3379
02:09:10,310 --> 02:09:11,170
This one?

3380
02:09:12,490 --> 02:09:12,730
No.

3381
02:09:13,250 --> 02:09:14,870
Is it the Spidey map?

3382
02:09:15,450 --> 02:09:16,090
Yes.

3383
02:09:18,330 --> 02:09:19,490
Spidey map.

3384
02:09:20,490 --> 02:09:21,550
Definitely Spidey map.

3385
02:09:21,690 --> 02:09:23,710
Is that the symbiotic surface?

3386
02:09:25,030 --> 02:09:26,310
This is what you get from me.

3387
02:09:26,390 --> 02:09:28,270
You have to capture a point first.

3388
02:09:28,530 --> 02:09:29,910
And then you get the card.

3389
02:09:31,290 --> 02:09:32,570
It's just the payload one.

3390
02:09:32,590 --> 02:09:33,530
Just the payload.

3391
02:09:34,870 --> 02:09:35,690
This one.

3392
02:09:35,690 --> 02:09:37,090
The payload spider map.

3393
02:09:37,550 --> 02:09:39,830
Wait, she means symbiotic surface.

3394
02:09:40,010 --> 02:09:40,610
You were right.

3395
02:09:42,630 --> 02:09:43,190
Guys...

3396
02:09:44,070 --> 02:09:45,070
It's all good.

3397
02:09:45,310 --> 02:09:46,370
It's all good.

3398
02:09:46,470 --> 02:09:48,330
It's really hard to describe the map.

3399
02:09:49,110 --> 02:09:51,030
That's why I call it goopy map.

3400
02:09:52,330 --> 02:09:52,930
Spidey map.

3401
02:09:53,450 --> 02:09:54,750
Not Glintar.

3402
02:09:55,430 --> 02:09:57,690
Girl spider in the beginning that goes like...

3403
02:09:58,470 --> 02:09:59,910
Yo, it's this way.

3404
02:10:00,470 --> 02:10:02,550
The one we played against you today, Poki?

3405
02:10:02,730 --> 02:10:04,030
In the scrims?

3406
02:10:04,030 --> 02:10:04,990
Were you played?

3407
02:10:05,630 --> 02:10:06,230
No.

3408
02:10:06,310 --> 02:10:07,890
We haven't played it today.

3409
02:10:08,830 --> 02:10:08,930
Nope.

3410
02:10:10,630 --> 02:10:14,330
We can't be losing the map select, guys.

3411
02:10:14,550 --> 02:10:15,850
This is embarrassing.

3412
02:10:16,310 --> 02:10:17,410
Lulu, we played it earlier.

3413
02:10:17,530 --> 02:10:19,630
The one we drawed on?

3414
02:10:19,730 --> 02:10:21,670
No, not the one we drawed on.

3415
02:10:22,450 --> 02:10:24,610
The one we smacked on.

3416
02:10:24,730 --> 02:10:26,010
I'm starting.

3417
02:10:26,930 --> 02:10:27,990
The symbiote.

3418
02:10:28,870 --> 02:10:30,170
I can't believe...

3419
02:10:30,170 --> 02:10:30,930
Guys, wow.

3420
02:10:30,930 --> 02:10:32,770
Yes, this one.

3421
02:10:32,890 --> 02:10:33,610
It's this one.

3422
02:10:33,610 --> 02:10:35,570
I can't.

3423
02:10:35,690 --> 02:10:37,210
It is this one.

3424
02:10:37,890 --> 02:10:38,970
I don't care.

3425
02:10:40,930 --> 02:10:42,750
Pick whatever map.

3426
02:10:43,370 --> 02:10:45,210
We know our fate.

3427
02:10:45,770 --> 02:10:47,610
We're against Shroud and Taric.

3428
02:10:51,590 --> 02:10:53,350
Whatever map...

3429
02:10:53,350 --> 02:10:54,630
We make our grave.

3430
02:11:00,930 --> 02:11:02,250
She's doomed.

3431
02:11:03,410 --> 02:11:05,240
I'll try my best.

3432
02:11:06,700 --> 02:11:09,350
What do you like to play second and third?

3433
02:11:10,190 --> 02:11:11,300
I usually play...

3434
02:11:12,570 --> 02:11:14,490
Support or Mr.Fantastic.

3435
02:11:15,770 --> 02:11:16,550
Unironically.

3436
02:11:18,490 --> 02:11:19,410
Protect Pantheon.

3437
02:11:22,850 --> 02:11:23,990
I'm dooming.

3438
02:11:24,930 --> 02:11:26,210
I'm gonna fuck out my Doomer.

3439
02:11:26,950 --> 02:11:28,710
But I'll still play my best.

3440
02:11:31,310 --> 02:11:32,630
I might be dooming.

3441
02:11:32,730 --> 02:11:34,130
But I'll still do my best.

3442
02:11:36,810 --> 02:11:38,230
You're Penny for sure.

3443
02:11:38,970 --> 02:11:39,510
It's fine.

3444
02:11:41,110 --> 02:11:42,030
Can someone...

3445
02:11:42,030 --> 02:11:42,710
What are we banning?

3446
02:11:46,890 --> 02:11:47,770
Surprise me.

3447
02:11:47,830 --> 02:11:48,390
Surprise me.

3448
02:11:53,470 --> 02:11:54,690
There's nothing I can ban.

3449
02:11:55,870 --> 02:11:56,950
There's nothing you can really...

3450
02:11:56,950 --> 02:11:58,790
We need someone who can take care of Storm.

3451
02:11:58,790 --> 02:11:59,770
Not gonna lie.

3452
02:12:01,110 --> 02:12:01,670
Storm?

3453
02:12:02,290 --> 02:12:02,890
I agree.

3454
02:12:03,150 --> 02:12:04,070
Shroud is gonna Storm.

3455
02:12:04,090 --> 02:12:05,070
The only issue...

3456
02:12:05,070 --> 02:12:08,830
They're really just using the fact that we have very...

3457
02:12:08,830 --> 02:12:09,950
A lack of support ults.

3458
02:12:11,250 --> 02:12:12,970
Defensive ults for their attacks.

3459
02:12:17,530 --> 02:12:19,070
I'll just flex whatever support...

3460
02:12:19,410 --> 02:12:20,510
The other support player wants to play.

3461
02:12:23,190 --> 02:12:25,190
Is it possible to two heal with this?

3462
02:12:26,550 --> 02:12:27,790
We can two heal.

3463
02:12:33,110 --> 02:12:35,830
This is gonna be really fucking scary.

3464
02:12:36,110 --> 02:12:36,430
But yeah.

3465
02:12:37,370 --> 02:12:38,630
You got the healing.

3466
02:12:38,730 --> 02:12:39,450
I got the DPS.

3467
02:12:39,710 --> 02:12:40,090
Good work.

3468
02:12:41,410 --> 02:12:43,510
What do we do against Storm?

3469
02:12:44,470 --> 02:12:45,410
We burn her.

3470
02:12:45,830 --> 02:12:47,190
Do you want a third support?

3471
02:12:48,150 --> 02:12:49,110
Or do you want me to go punish her?

3472
02:12:49,290 --> 02:12:49,950
Go punish her.

3473
02:12:50,110 --> 02:12:52,370
We don't punish her.

3474
02:12:52,450 --> 02:12:53,130
We need a rocket.

3475
02:12:55,370 --> 02:12:55,850
Mmm.

3476
02:12:57,190 --> 02:12:59,090
I don't think we can.

3477
02:12:59,210 --> 02:13:00,190
I'll be honest with you.

3478
02:13:00,550 --> 02:13:02,390
I don't think we're gonna get Vladimir.

3479
02:13:02,810 --> 02:13:04,450
You wanna learn rocket?

3480
02:13:06,250 --> 02:13:07,710
I'd rather fucking cut off my hands.

3481
02:13:07,710 --> 02:13:08,210
It's so easy.

3482
02:13:08,990 --> 02:13:10,830
I'd rather cut off my hands than play rocket.

3483
02:13:10,850 --> 02:13:12,350
Don't I just press right click like this?

3484
02:13:14,950 --> 02:13:16,710
When I'm in my turret...

3485
02:13:17,330 --> 02:13:18,770
Don't drop the infinite ammo.

3486
02:13:19,370 --> 02:13:20,490
I'll call for infinite.

3487
02:13:20,490 --> 02:13:20,550
I'll call for infinite.

3488
02:13:30,450 --> 02:13:33,910
At this corner you can drop it.

3489
02:13:34,170 --> 02:13:35,190
Around this corner.

3490
02:13:35,830 --> 02:13:36,790
Drop it.

3491
02:13:37,510 --> 02:13:38,690
Oh my.

3492
02:13:40,050 --> 02:13:40,550
Nice.

3493
02:13:42,710 --> 02:13:43,490
Go punish her.

3494
02:13:45,890 --> 02:13:46,590
I'm on it.

3495
02:13:47,750 --> 02:13:49,770
Okay we don't have...

3496
02:13:49,770 --> 02:13:50,470
Good job.

3497
02:13:52,030 --> 02:13:53,550
Careful because...

3498
02:13:53,550 --> 02:13:54,650
I'm solo healing.

3499
02:13:55,990 --> 02:13:56,550
Careful.

3500
02:13:57,210 --> 02:13:57,950
Widow half up top.

3501
02:13:58,690 --> 02:13:59,450
Widow 25 HP.

3502
02:14:02,290 --> 02:14:02,850
Yep.

3503
02:14:03,310 --> 02:14:03,730
I'm healing now.

3504
02:14:04,630 --> 02:14:05,710
I pushed him.

3505
02:14:05,930 --> 02:14:06,850
I pulled him to us.

3506
02:14:08,210 --> 02:14:09,330
Strange in the half.

3507
02:14:09,450 --> 02:14:10,370
Strange is by himself.

3508
02:14:12,690 --> 02:14:14,170
1 HP on Widow.

3509
02:14:15,970 --> 02:14:18,250
Whenever you have infinite again drop it.

3510
02:14:18,570 --> 02:14:18,870
Dropping.

3511
02:14:19,450 --> 02:14:19,930
Thank you.

3512
02:14:19,930 --> 02:14:21,110
Push him up.

3513
02:14:22,930 --> 02:14:23,010
Strange.

3514
02:14:23,730 --> 02:14:24,210
Backing.

3515
02:14:26,250 --> 02:14:27,850
We're just spamming heals on you.

3516
02:14:27,990 --> 02:14:28,570
Thank you for spamming.

3517
02:14:29,010 --> 02:14:30,610
I have all here.

3518
02:14:30,650 --> 02:14:31,750
I'm going to push up with this.

3519
02:14:31,930 --> 02:14:32,170
Okay.

3520
02:14:32,750 --> 02:14:33,770
I'm pushing up.

3521
02:14:34,190 --> 02:14:35,930
Go up.

3522
02:14:36,470 --> 02:14:36,990
I'm on Widow.

3523
02:14:38,150 --> 02:14:39,050
Can I ulti here?

3524
02:14:39,850 --> 02:14:40,190
That's good.

3525
02:14:42,070 --> 02:14:42,550
Nevermind.

3526
02:14:42,950 --> 02:14:44,230
We got a burner.

3527
02:14:46,450 --> 02:14:46,990
Oh wait.

3528
02:14:46,990 --> 02:14:47,970
Oh my god.

3529
02:14:48,670 --> 02:14:49,870
I'm dead here.

3530
02:14:50,550 --> 02:14:52,290
I'm dead here too.

3531
02:14:53,170 --> 02:14:53,830
I'm alive.

3532
02:14:54,630 --> 02:14:54,830
Punisher.

3533
02:14:56,790 --> 02:14:58,470
You have Raccoon.

3534
02:14:58,510 --> 02:15:00,010
I'm giving you infinite ammo now.

3535
02:15:00,450 --> 02:15:01,110
Ult this.

3536
02:15:01,130 --> 02:15:01,510
Ult this.

3537
02:15:03,290 --> 02:15:03,810
Nevermind.

3538
02:15:04,170 --> 02:15:05,030
Don't ult this.

3539
02:15:08,750 --> 02:15:10,510
We can ult this actually.

3540
02:15:11,310 --> 02:15:13,030
Bulgar is going in with his ult.

3541
02:15:13,030 --> 02:15:14,030
I'm waiting.

3542
02:15:15,010 --> 02:15:15,290
He missed.

3543
02:15:18,770 --> 02:15:20,270
Ult this when you can.

3544
02:15:24,910 --> 02:15:25,810
We're out.

3545
02:15:26,090 --> 02:15:26,890
Holy fuck.

3546
02:15:27,230 --> 02:15:27,450
Chill.

3547
02:15:27,730 --> 02:15:27,730
Chill.

3548
02:15:27,950 --> 02:15:27,950
Chill.

3549
02:15:29,710 --> 02:15:31,050
Strange is looking for an ult probably.

3550
02:15:31,570 --> 02:15:32,750
He used it.

3551
02:15:33,470 --> 02:15:33,970
Get him.

3552
02:15:34,430 --> 02:15:34,630
Get him.

3553
02:15:35,750 --> 02:15:36,310
Wait.

3554
02:15:36,830 --> 02:15:38,750
You have Resguard.

3555
02:15:38,890 --> 02:15:39,710
Did you ever use it?

3556
02:15:39,710 --> 02:15:40,510
Yeah.

3557
02:15:40,550 --> 02:15:40,730
Yeah.

3558
02:15:40,750 --> 02:15:40,850
Yeah.

3559
02:15:40,850 --> 02:15:43,050
I didn't know you did.

3560
02:15:43,070 --> 02:15:44,050
I broke it.

3561
02:15:44,230 --> 02:15:47,310
I broke it to move it up.

3562
02:15:47,590 --> 02:15:48,630
I just got it down.

3563
02:15:49,070 --> 02:15:49,570
You're alone.

3564
02:15:50,850 --> 02:15:52,210
We need to regroup here.

3565
02:15:54,390 --> 02:15:55,510
Oh, I'm muted.

3566
02:15:55,970 --> 02:15:56,030
Fuck.

3567
02:15:57,670 --> 02:16:00,070
Yo, just yell at me next time.

3568
02:16:00,670 --> 02:16:02,390
I thought you were super focused.

3569
02:16:02,570 --> 02:16:02,570
It's okay.

3570
02:16:02,570 --> 02:16:03,110
This is going well.

3571
02:16:03,470 --> 02:16:04,530
I thought you were locked in.

3572
02:16:04,530 --> 02:16:05,590
I was super muted.

3573
02:16:05,590 --> 02:16:06,790
I thought you were locked in.

3574
02:16:08,010 --> 02:16:09,590
We can go in with...

3575
02:16:10,710 --> 02:16:11,510
Raccoon ult.

3576
02:16:12,190 --> 02:16:12,310
Yeah.

3577
02:16:12,470 --> 02:16:12,470
Yeah.

3578
02:16:12,530 --> 02:16:13,030
I'm waiting.

3579
02:16:13,810 --> 02:16:14,210
Okay.

3580
02:16:15,290 --> 02:16:15,990
We can.

3581
02:16:16,190 --> 02:16:16,870
We can.

3582
02:16:17,910 --> 02:16:18,710
I'm dead here.

3583
02:16:19,090 --> 02:16:20,910
I'm looking for...

3584
02:16:20,910 --> 02:16:21,450
I'm dead.

3585
02:16:22,590 --> 02:16:23,130
I'm dead.

3586
02:16:23,670 --> 02:16:23,810
Yeah.

3587
02:16:23,970 --> 02:16:24,230
I'm dead.

3588
02:16:25,670 --> 02:16:26,970
We just have to reset.

3589
02:16:27,150 --> 02:16:27,710
They all ulted.

3590
02:16:27,890 --> 02:16:28,090
Yeah.

3591
02:16:28,790 --> 02:16:29,130
Yeah.

3592
02:16:32,810 --> 02:16:35,550
Okay, guys.

3593
02:16:35,650 --> 02:16:36,070
I have my ult.

3594
02:16:37,090 --> 02:16:37,430
Okay.

3595
02:16:37,430 --> 02:16:38,350
I'm 79.

3596
02:16:39,210 --> 02:16:39,890
I think...

3597
02:16:39,890 --> 02:16:41,470
We need your ult for Punisher ult.

3598
02:16:42,650 --> 02:16:44,490
We've been holding on to Raccoon ult.

3599
02:16:44,670 --> 02:16:45,390
I need heals and choke.

3600
02:16:45,870 --> 02:16:47,830
We need to use Raccoon ult.

3601
02:16:47,950 --> 02:16:48,930
Can you give me...

3602
02:16:49,670 --> 02:16:50,910
Oh, you did.

3603
02:16:51,310 --> 02:16:51,650
Okay.

3604
02:16:53,010 --> 02:16:53,550
He has it again.

3605
02:16:53,670 --> 02:16:54,010
That's insane.

3606
02:16:54,610 --> 02:16:55,130
Oh, wait.

3607
02:16:55,150 --> 02:16:56,390
Actually, we have to go in with this.

3608
02:16:57,150 --> 02:16:57,990
I can't.

3609
02:16:58,030 --> 02:16:58,690
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3610
02:16:58,690 --> 02:16:59,130
I didn't realize.

3611
02:17:00,330 --> 02:17:00,770
Okay.

3612
02:17:02,110 --> 02:17:02,650
I'm in.

3613
02:17:02,750 --> 02:17:02,870
I'm in.

3614
02:17:02,970 --> 02:17:03,070
I'm in.

3615
02:17:03,250 --> 02:17:04,850
Oh, I need...

3616
02:17:04,850 --> 02:17:05,410
Oh.

3617
02:17:09,830 --> 02:17:10,270
No.

3618
02:17:10,730 --> 02:17:13,270
I would've killed the Raccoon if he didn't use that ult.

3619
02:17:14,590 --> 02:17:15,750
I'm on it for you.

3620
02:17:16,730 --> 02:17:17,130
I'm on it.

3621
02:17:17,130 --> 02:17:17,490
I'm on it.

3622
02:17:17,830 --> 02:17:18,670
I'm dead.

3623
02:17:20,310 --> 02:17:20,650
I'm dead.

3624
02:17:21,050 --> 02:17:21,630
I'm coming back.

3625
02:17:21,730 --> 02:17:22,190
I'm coming back.

3626
02:17:24,610 --> 02:17:25,490
Can we...

3627
02:17:25,490 --> 02:17:26,370
Can we...

3628
02:17:30,510 --> 02:17:31,830
I'm literally throwing.

3629
02:17:32,030 --> 02:17:32,790
I'm so sorry.

3630
02:17:32,830 --> 02:17:33,470
Don't worry about it.

3631
02:17:33,470 --> 02:17:34,750
Don't think about it, Nora.

3632
02:17:35,090 --> 02:17:35,790
It's fine.

3633
02:17:36,210 --> 02:17:37,930
It's not that...

3634
02:17:38,570 --> 02:17:41,270
It's a 4-5 tournament for skins.

3635
02:17:42,050 --> 02:17:44,170
Listen, if anyone feels bad about their performance, it doesn't matter.

3636
02:17:44,270 --> 02:17:46,610
We're not playing fucking finals of...

3637
02:17:46,610 --> 02:17:48,190
whatever their final thing is.

3638
02:17:48,310 --> 02:17:49,490
We're playing Apex Legends finals.

3639
02:17:49,690 --> 02:17:50,490
It doesn't matter.

3640
02:17:50,830 --> 02:17:51,170
That's what I mean.

3641
02:17:51,390 --> 02:17:51,710
Lock in.

3642
02:17:51,910 --> 02:17:52,970
We can still win.

3643
02:17:52,970 --> 02:17:53,370
Okay.

3644
02:17:55,010 --> 02:18:00,950
I actually think we need a shield tank with Penny here to lower the damage.

3645
02:18:02,650 --> 02:18:05,150
I could play...

3646
02:18:05,830 --> 02:18:06,830
Magneto if you'd like.

3647
02:18:07,630 --> 02:18:09,330
I think Penny's better.

3648
02:18:09,530 --> 02:18:10,770
Do you not want to play Strange?

3649
02:18:11,510 --> 02:18:15,270
I can play Strange, but I feel like I'm just gonna eat shit by their Punisher and Storm.

3650
02:18:16,550 --> 02:18:17,930
I'll play Loki.

3651
02:18:18,890 --> 02:18:23,030
Even then, my Invo's gonna do jack shit against their Storm.

3652
02:18:24,490 --> 02:18:27,410
I do think if we calm a lot...

3653
02:18:28,690 --> 02:18:31,030
I mean, the defense is probably better.

3654
02:18:31,970 --> 02:18:33,230
Do you want to play Loki or Sue?

3655
02:18:34,750 --> 02:18:37,730
I think you go Sue because you can't copy Raccoon.

3656
02:18:38,270 --> 02:18:39,090
That's true.

3657
02:18:39,330 --> 02:18:39,550
Yeah.

3658
02:18:40,310 --> 02:18:41,190
So you kind of need Sue.

3659
02:18:44,630 --> 02:18:46,610
Do you have your Res Beacon down?

3660
02:18:46,890 --> 02:18:48,010
Yeah, it's up top.

3661
02:18:48,010 --> 02:18:50,010
We could try and trip support if...

3662
02:18:52,150 --> 02:18:52,630
here...

3663
02:18:52,630 --> 02:19:00,150
If we die early and it's not working, just run a triple support and see how it goes.

3664
02:19:00,450 --> 02:19:01,570
They know, you know?

3665
02:19:03,410 --> 02:19:06,570
Like when our DPS gets swapped to a third support.

3666
02:19:16,380 --> 02:19:17,420
Infinite ammo whenever.

3667
02:19:18,220 --> 02:19:18,700
Dropping.

3668
02:19:19,640 --> 02:19:20,020
Thank you.

3669
02:19:21,840 --> 02:19:23,980
Strange tanking a lot here on the side.

3670
02:19:28,720 --> 02:19:29,840
Let me turret down.

3671
02:19:32,360 --> 02:19:33,000
Magic Ankh.

3672
02:19:34,340 --> 02:19:35,340
The Ankh, the Ankh.

3673
02:19:35,600 --> 02:19:36,820
I have ulti, I have ulti.

3674
02:19:37,080 --> 02:19:38,200
Yeah, do it, do it, do it.

3675
02:19:38,360 --> 02:19:38,760
Yeah, I'm ulti.

3676
02:19:41,100 --> 02:19:41,580
Strange one.

3677
02:19:42,640 --> 02:19:43,580
Strange is one.

3678
02:19:45,040 --> 02:19:47,840
He followed me.

3679
02:19:48,700 --> 02:19:49,420
I have ult, though, here.

3680
02:19:50,200 --> 02:19:51,540
Yeah, we can win this.

3681
02:19:53,880 --> 02:19:55,900
The ult is on point, the ult is on point.

3682
02:19:57,720 --> 02:19:58,560
Looking at Strange.

3683
02:20:03,400 --> 02:20:05,180
We have no defensive ult, though.

3684
02:20:09,220 --> 02:20:10,840
Help me, Vermeer, help me for this.

3685
02:20:11,040 --> 02:20:13,040
I don't have push, I don't have push anymore.

3686
02:20:14,220 --> 02:20:15,660
Are you good there?

3687
02:20:15,860 --> 02:20:18,020
I think they have Moon Knight, though.

3688
02:20:18,020 --> 02:20:20,160
They have Moon Knight, oh, and they have Strange ult.

3689
02:20:21,180 --> 02:20:21,860
I'm gonna ult.

3690
02:20:22,800 --> 02:20:24,320
I couldn't, I got Moon Knighted.

3691
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:27,580
I'm giving you infinite ammo.

3692
02:20:28,260 --> 02:20:29,600
I got Moon Knighted.

3693
02:20:29,660 --> 02:20:30,340
Yeah, watch out Strange ult.

3694
02:20:30,520 --> 02:20:31,100
He's going in, guys.

3695
02:20:32,600 --> 02:20:34,480
Oh, he just walked on you, man.

3696
02:20:37,660 --> 02:20:38,960
I'm coming over.

3697
02:20:41,800 --> 02:20:43,120
I'm pushing up here, guys.

3698
02:20:43,480 --> 02:20:44,080
Oh, I'm dead.

3699
02:20:48,720 --> 02:20:49,880
I'm not gonna do anything.

3700
02:20:50,080 --> 02:20:51,100
I got blocked by Storm.

3701
02:20:51,580 --> 02:20:53,440
We have too many DPS ults.

3702
02:20:53,540 --> 02:20:54,540
We don't have enough support ults.

3703
02:20:57,020 --> 02:20:57,600
It's kind of rough.

3704
02:21:01,980 --> 02:21:03,480
Listen, guys, one more map here.

3705
02:21:03,840 --> 02:21:04,900
Don't worry about it.

3706
02:21:05,780 --> 02:21:07,580
Don't worry about it.

3707
02:21:14,300 --> 02:21:15,780
Bogr, be our leader.

3708
02:21:16,540 --> 02:21:18,000
Listen, I'm trying, okay?

3709
02:21:18,060 --> 02:21:19,300
But it's kind of a rough situation.

3710
02:21:19,860 --> 02:21:20,740
Where's the energy?

3711
02:21:21,720 --> 02:21:23,840
I don't know what you mean by rough situation.

3712
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,380
I don't feel a passion, Bogr.

3713
02:21:28,820 --> 02:21:29,640
Where's your passion?

3714
02:21:30,020 --> 02:21:31,080
I feel like you're giving up.

3715
02:21:31,600 --> 02:21:33,820
Your time zone is not my problem.

3716
02:21:34,180 --> 02:21:35,740
You know how long it's gonna be.

3717
02:21:36,260 --> 02:21:38,100
We can try triple support.

3718
02:21:38,720 --> 02:21:39,800
We can do anything.

3719
02:21:43,020 --> 02:21:45,120
You knew the schedule, Bogr.

3720
02:21:45,140 --> 02:21:46,720
You could have slept earlier.

3721
02:21:47,720 --> 02:21:48,880
I did actually take a nap.

3722
02:21:48,880 --> 02:21:53,060
But it is hard for me to triple support if there's no Luna and no Cloak.

3723
02:21:53,160 --> 02:21:54,940
I'm sorry to say this, I don't think we protect Penny.

3724
02:21:55,440 --> 02:21:56,860
I think we need to protect the support ult.

3725
02:21:57,140 --> 02:21:58,120
And we need support ults.

3726
02:21:58,320 --> 02:22:03,040
They know they can just overpower with APS ults.

3727
02:22:03,920 --> 02:22:06,180
If we do that, we can just run triple support then.

3728
02:22:08,480 --> 02:22:09,640
Cloak or Luna?

3729
02:22:10,340 --> 02:22:11,160
Cloak is better.

3730
02:22:11,920 --> 02:22:13,280
Or we can play Luna as well.

3731
02:22:13,520 --> 02:22:14,500
We banned Cloak.

3732
02:22:15,820 --> 02:22:17,580
Didn't they ban Cloak first?

3733
02:22:17,720 --> 02:22:19,180
Luna ult is kind of better.

3734
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:21,060
No, Cloak ult is better.

3735
02:22:21,060 --> 02:22:22,960
Sorry, I mean easier.

3736
02:22:24,540 --> 02:22:28,420
Depending on what they're playing, how easy it is to react to a certain ult.

3737
02:22:28,520 --> 02:22:29,440
But I could do either.

3738
02:22:30,300 --> 02:22:31,640
I think they're going to ban Cloak again.

3739
02:22:35,060 --> 02:22:37,420
I guess we can protect whichever one they don't.

3740
02:22:37,520 --> 02:22:38,660
They're going to ban one support.

3741
02:22:39,020 --> 02:22:41,280
So we just need to protect the other one.

3742
02:22:43,640 --> 02:22:45,040
Honestly, we did pretty well.

3743
02:22:45,660 --> 02:22:46,100
Considering...

3744
02:22:48,560 --> 02:22:50,300
Considering the fact that I wasn't so energetic.

3745
02:22:50,600 --> 02:22:51,800
And I've given up, obviously.

3746
02:22:53,480 --> 02:22:54,840
You gave up?

3747
02:22:55,140 --> 02:22:57,520
He gave up because Karrick yelled at him.

3748
02:22:57,700 --> 02:22:58,400
And then his soul...

3749
02:22:58,400 --> 02:22:59,320
Guys, shut the fuck up.

3750
02:22:59,580 --> 02:22:59,700
I'm crashing out.

3751
02:23:01,260 --> 02:23:03,340
He yelled at him in front of everybody.

3752
02:23:03,540 --> 02:23:05,620
So now he's crashing out.

3753
02:23:06,280 --> 02:23:07,000
I'm crashing out.

3754
02:23:09,580 --> 02:23:12,440
Wait, are they picking map?

3755
02:23:12,440 --> 02:23:14,880
I think so, but I don't think they care.

3756
02:23:19,600 --> 02:23:21,100
I'm just playing to play.

3757
02:23:22,680 --> 02:23:24,720
I'm a support champ.

3758
02:23:26,320 --> 02:23:29,060
I wanted DPS.

3759
02:23:33,600 --> 02:23:36,260
Fulgur doesn't want to die.

3760
02:23:46,020 --> 02:23:46,580
Okay.

3761
02:23:47,520 --> 02:23:48,440
I won a game.

3762
02:23:48,620 --> 02:23:50,220
Okay, it was against Karrick's team.

3763
02:23:50,360 --> 02:23:51,380
Yesterday, last night.

3764
02:23:51,700 --> 02:23:54,940
I literally won a game with 4 DPS and 2 supports.

3765
02:23:59,900 --> 02:24:01,780
It was actually crazy.

3766
02:24:02,060 --> 02:24:04,800
Because Karrick's team was like...

3767
02:24:04,800 --> 02:24:05,640
2-2-2.

3768
02:24:05,640 --> 02:24:07,800
Like a normal fucking team comp.

3769
02:24:08,280 --> 02:24:09,300
And then...

3770
02:24:09,300 --> 02:24:11,520
Our tank player...

3771
02:24:11,520 --> 02:24:13,560
Crashed out and played DPS.

3772
02:24:13,760 --> 02:24:15,740
And was yelling at our other DPS.

3773
02:24:15,900 --> 02:24:17,800
And was like, what the fuck are you guys doing?

3774
02:24:19,620 --> 02:24:21,660
And then our tank player...

3775
02:24:21,660 --> 02:24:23,320
Ended up getting like...

3776
02:24:23,320 --> 02:24:25,200
30 plus kills after this.

3777
02:24:25,580 --> 02:24:26,240
Watch the TV.

3778
02:24:26,240 --> 02:24:27,860
I'm banning Storm Dance.

3779
02:24:28,340 --> 02:24:29,880
No, we can ban Garou.

3780
02:24:30,240 --> 02:24:30,940
No, let's ban Storm.

3781
02:24:31,540 --> 02:24:33,500
They ended up like...

3782
02:24:34,240 --> 02:24:36,500
Ended up out-damaging...

3783
02:24:36,500 --> 02:24:38,960
And out-killing our other 3 DPS.

3784
02:24:41,340 --> 02:24:43,900
Wait, it wasn't even our tank player.

3785
02:24:44,240 --> 02:24:45,420
It was our support player.

3786
02:24:45,560 --> 02:24:48,320
No, our support player crashed out.

3787
02:24:48,620 --> 02:24:51,440
Our support player swapped to DPS.

3788
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,240
And then our tank player...

3789
02:24:54,240 --> 02:24:55,860
Had to swap to support.

3790
02:24:56,060 --> 02:24:57,360
So we had...

3791
02:24:57,360 --> 02:24:59,000
4 DPS and whatnot.

3792
02:24:59,340 --> 02:25:02,040
It wasn't even our tank that crashed out.

3793
02:25:02,040 --> 02:25:03,480
It was my other support.

3794
02:25:04,160 --> 02:25:06,360
And then they ended up getting 3 plus kills.

3795
02:25:06,560 --> 02:25:07,660
And MVP ace.

3796
02:25:11,220 --> 02:25:12,940
And they were like...

3797
02:25:12,940 --> 02:25:14,680
Can anyone please swap with me, please?

3798
02:25:14,740 --> 02:25:15,840
You guys are doing nothing.

3799
02:25:19,800 --> 02:25:21,220
That's so crazy.

3800
02:25:21,220 --> 02:25:22,720
But yeah, I won against it.

3801
02:25:22,780 --> 02:25:25,560
And then I was re-watching Krooky's VOD yesterday.

3802
02:25:26,120 --> 02:25:26,620
And like...

3803
02:25:26,620 --> 02:25:29,240
2 people on his team was crashing out.

3804
02:25:29,340 --> 02:25:31,200
They lost against my team.

3805
02:25:31,340 --> 02:25:31,600
I know.

3806
02:25:31,840 --> 02:25:32,300
I don't think so.

3807
02:25:32,340 --> 02:25:32,620
I'll be honest.

3808
02:25:35,260 --> 02:25:35,620
Wait,

3809
02:25:40,540 --> 02:25:41,660
they didn't protect a second.

3810
02:25:43,280 --> 02:25:44,180
I guess they didn't care.

3811
02:25:45,380 --> 02:25:46,460
I'll be honest with you, bro.

3812
02:25:47,260 --> 02:25:48,100
I'll be honest with you.

3813
02:25:48,100 --> 02:25:49,740
No, they pity us!

3814
02:25:50,040 --> 02:25:50,100
No!

3815
02:25:51,180 --> 02:25:53,180
No, they think we're such a big threat.

3816
02:25:53,600 --> 02:25:57,820
I think they're not gonna ban even.

3817
02:25:58,900 --> 02:25:59,740
Oh, they did ban Wolverine.

3818
02:26:00,100 --> 02:26:00,280
Alright.

3819
02:26:02,720 --> 02:26:03,600
Alright, Wolverine.

3820
02:26:04,220 --> 02:26:05,940
I know what you guys are missing from the comp.

3821
02:26:06,500 --> 02:26:07,980
No, probably not.

3822
02:26:14,100 --> 02:26:16,920
I'll just compliment whoever plays the other support.

3823
02:26:16,920 --> 02:26:17,060
Alright.

3824
02:26:19,800 --> 02:26:20,820
Honestly, I love that.

3825
02:26:20,960 --> 02:26:20,960
I can Luna.

3826
02:26:20,960 --> 02:26:21,480
I can Penny.

3827
02:26:21,600 --> 02:26:22,320
What's the vibe?

3828
02:26:22,800 --> 02:26:24,760
The vibes are triple support, I think.

3829
02:26:24,900 --> 02:26:25,000
Maybe.

3830
02:26:25,940 --> 02:26:26,420
Period.

3831
02:26:28,920 --> 02:26:29,760
Don't go, Adam.

3832
02:26:32,220 --> 02:26:33,820
Wait, are you serious?

3833
02:26:35,460 --> 02:26:37,040
Adam is last season meta.

3834
02:26:37,380 --> 02:26:38,600
He's not this season meta.

3835
02:26:38,700 --> 02:26:39,020
That's why.

3836
02:26:39,800 --> 02:26:40,860
We need support loads.

3837
02:26:43,220 --> 02:26:44,600
Is that a Sue or Loki?

3838
02:26:45,120 --> 02:26:46,200
You gotta go Sue or Loki.

3839
02:26:46,200 --> 02:26:47,180
It's fine, it's fine.

3840
02:26:47,260 --> 02:26:48,200
Doki is gonna play support.

3841
02:26:48,400 --> 02:26:49,720
Lulu, do you play support or do you wanna play this?

3842
02:26:51,520 --> 02:26:52,600
I can do either.

3843
02:26:52,900 --> 02:26:55,400
It's just what you think would be better for the team.

3844
02:26:55,540 --> 02:26:55,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3845
02:26:55,960 --> 02:26:57,460
Go support.

3846
02:26:57,560 --> 02:26:58,200
Doki, go support.

3847
02:26:58,820 --> 02:27:01,160
And you...

3848
02:27:01,860 --> 02:27:02,220
You...

3849
02:27:02,220 --> 02:27:02,840
Know what you're thinking.

3850
02:27:03,760 --> 02:27:04,840
Do it, do it, do it.

3851
02:27:05,040 --> 02:27:08,480
We gotta pick Sue, guys.

3852
02:27:08,480 --> 02:27:09,560
I'm not joking.

3853
02:27:10,080 --> 02:27:11,640
You don't wanna play Strange?

3854
02:27:12,240 --> 02:27:13,820
The thing is, they have so much damage.

3855
02:27:14,500 --> 02:27:15,780
My shield just breaks.

3856
02:27:16,260 --> 02:27:17,800
I need something to do with her Punisher.

3857
02:27:18,900 --> 02:27:22,100
I feel like you doing damage as well is helpful.

3858
02:27:22,960 --> 02:27:25,960
The thing is, I'm solo tanking and second of all, they have so much damage.

3859
02:27:27,980 --> 02:27:29,720
MrFantastic is basically another tank.

3860
02:27:29,880 --> 02:27:31,120
He's like a sub-tank.

3861
02:27:37,210 --> 02:27:39,030
I'm gonna have to swap off Loki, they have a Moon Knight.

3862
02:27:39,990 --> 02:27:41,070
Choose Strange, choose Strange.

3863
02:27:42,110 --> 02:27:42,650
There's a...

3864
02:27:43,190 --> 02:27:44,050
There's a...

3865
02:27:45,070 --> 02:27:46,390
There's an Immortar left.

3866
02:27:47,570 --> 02:27:48,290
Can we kill him?

3867
02:27:48,530 --> 02:27:50,810
Yeah, he was just free farming.

3868
02:27:50,930 --> 02:27:52,250
He's floating up above us.

3869
02:27:52,730 --> 02:27:53,330
Half health.

3870
02:27:55,130 --> 02:27:56,790
I'm trying, I'm really trying.

3871
02:27:57,370 --> 02:27:58,930
But the tentacles are killing me.

3872
02:27:59,530 --> 02:28:00,430
I'm going to swap.

3873
02:28:05,510 --> 02:28:07,250
Yeah, we need to deal with the Immortar on the flank.

3874
02:28:08,830 --> 02:28:09,670
I'm not gonna lie...

3875
02:28:10,470 --> 02:28:12,270
Yeah, we really do need to focus him.

3876
02:28:12,930 --> 02:28:14,770
He was pretty much in our faces.

3877
02:28:16,630 --> 02:28:18,030
Maybe MrFantastic here can deal with him.

3878
02:28:18,090 --> 02:28:19,110
Wait, I was on him the whole time.

3879
02:28:19,530 --> 02:28:21,470
You were not on him, I died.

3880
02:28:21,830 --> 02:28:22,490
No, you weren't.

3881
02:28:24,390 --> 02:28:25,030
Come right side.

3882
02:28:26,150 --> 02:28:27,090
Let's go right side.

3883
02:28:34,190 --> 02:28:35,530
I'm just poking them here.

3884
02:28:35,670 --> 02:28:36,450
Just play behind the angles.

3885
02:28:36,450 --> 02:28:37,670
Behind the walls.

3886
02:28:37,890 --> 02:28:39,330
I'm shooting the Moira.

3887
02:28:41,490 --> 02:28:41,990
Yeah, we're chilling.

3888
02:28:42,130 --> 02:28:43,450
The octopus.

3889
02:28:44,270 --> 02:28:44,970
Yeah, I'm shooting the octopus.

3890
02:28:50,070 --> 02:28:51,990
The Moira has nothing.

3891
02:28:54,110 --> 02:28:56,010
Honestly, you can swap, MrFantastic, if you don't feel it.

3892
02:28:56,730 --> 02:28:57,430
I'm pushing X.

3893
02:28:57,570 --> 02:28:58,110
Nice kill, nice kill.

3894
02:28:58,470 --> 02:28:59,750
X half, X half.

3895
02:29:01,550 --> 02:29:02,670
Just do anything, it's fine.

3896
02:29:03,490 --> 02:29:03,970
I have my ult.

3897
02:29:06,450 --> 02:29:06,530
I have my ult.

3898
02:29:08,210 --> 02:29:09,190
Switch off.

3899
02:29:12,410 --> 02:29:13,430
I'm pressing.

3900
02:29:13,930 --> 02:29:14,310
Nice.

3901
02:29:18,450 --> 02:29:22,430
I'm doing as much as I can.

3902
02:29:23,390 --> 02:29:25,390
We still have our MrFantastic here.

3903
02:29:26,470 --> 02:29:27,410
Look at Namor.

3904
02:29:27,730 --> 02:29:29,550
Look at Namor.

3905
02:29:31,070 --> 02:29:32,190
Namor, Namor, Namor.

3906
02:29:32,790 --> 02:29:32,890
Okay.

3907
02:29:34,050 --> 02:29:34,430
I'm 1 HP.

3908
02:29:34,430 --> 02:29:36,270
I'm 1 HP.

3909
02:29:36,970 --> 02:29:38,210
I'm so low to start.

3910
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:43,280
Maybe I can go strangers.

3911
02:29:43,640 --> 02:29:44,780
We have Luna.

3912
02:29:44,920 --> 02:29:45,900
Come back, come back.

3913
02:29:47,360 --> 02:29:49,980
I can TP, I can TP.

3914
02:29:51,140 --> 02:29:52,400
I'm alright here.

3915
02:29:52,740 --> 02:29:53,440
I'm alive.

3916
02:29:54,120 --> 02:29:54,580
Hey guys.

3917
02:29:54,680 --> 02:29:57,100
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

3918
02:29:57,400 --> 02:29:57,760
I'm going Prime.

3919
02:29:59,540 --> 02:30:01,260
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

3920
02:30:01,580 --> 02:30:02,100
Ulting.

3921
02:30:03,200 --> 02:30:04,720
Change as ult, by the way.

3922
02:30:04,960 --> 02:30:05,340
I'm pushing, I'm pushing.

3923
02:30:06,220 --> 02:30:07,120
Yeah, deal with it, guys.

3924
02:30:07,500 --> 02:30:08,420
I need to kill the backline.

3925
02:30:09,260 --> 02:30:11,300
He's gonna have ult, so he's waiting for it.

3926
02:30:11,760 --> 02:30:12,740
I have push, I think.

3927
02:30:13,240 --> 02:30:14,200
Oh yeah, he's not.

3928
02:30:15,340 --> 02:30:16,600
They flipped him up, guys.

3929
02:30:16,840 --> 02:30:17,360
They're behind us.

3930
02:30:18,960 --> 02:30:20,880
Guys, the tentacles!

3931
02:30:22,100 --> 02:30:24,020
On point, and he's half HP.

3932
02:30:24,200 --> 02:30:25,600
I don't know if anymore, but...

3933
02:30:25,600 --> 02:30:26,500
I'm coming back, I'm coming back.

3934
02:30:28,260 --> 02:30:28,980
Strange half, strange half.

3935
02:30:31,180 --> 02:30:31,460
Nice.

3936
02:30:32,360 --> 02:30:33,220
I'm on strange, I'm on strange.

3937
02:30:34,820 --> 02:30:35,660
Strange half, strange half.

3938
02:30:35,940 --> 02:30:37,580
I pulled him, I pulled him back to us.

3939
02:30:37,660 --> 02:30:37,900
That's sick.

3940
02:30:38,380 --> 02:30:38,660
Nice.

3941
02:30:39,620 --> 02:30:40,220
I got him, I got him.

3942
02:30:40,680 --> 02:30:41,680
I need heals, I need heals.

3943
02:30:42,440 --> 02:30:43,220
Behind, behind, behind!

3944
02:30:45,280 --> 02:30:47,220
We can kill him more, we can kill him more!

3945
02:30:47,600 --> 02:30:49,020
I pulled him to us, kill him, kill him!

3946
02:30:49,040 --> 02:30:50,320
Nice, nice.

3947
02:30:50,420 --> 02:30:51,060
Good pull, good pull, good pull.

3948
02:30:51,460 --> 02:30:53,440
Yeah, you're good, you're good.

3949
02:30:54,760 --> 02:30:55,720
Honestly, pretty good, pretty good.

3950
02:30:55,720 --> 02:30:56,600
Let's farm support ults.

3951
02:30:56,780 --> 02:30:59,300
I have ult in...

3952
02:30:59,300 --> 02:31:01,120
We'll mantis ult first, we'll mantis ult first.

3953
02:31:01,140 --> 02:31:02,860
Can you try to boop him when he flies in?

3954
02:31:03,120 --> 02:31:04,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we'll try, we'll try.

3955
02:31:04,620 --> 02:31:06,140
That's good, we'll save it.

3956
02:31:08,780 --> 02:31:09,980
And you can slow with your pentakill.

3957
02:31:10,640 --> 02:31:11,840
We mantis ult first, remember?

3958
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:13,040
I'm waiting for them to come in before I ult you.

3959
02:31:13,060 --> 02:31:14,660
Yeah, just don't, yeah, stay on the left side.

3960
02:31:20,080 --> 02:31:20,860
I'm on him, I'm on him.

3961
02:31:21,740 --> 02:31:22,220
I'm chilling.

3962
02:31:22,700 --> 02:31:23,540
Chase is looking for an ult.

3963
02:31:23,960 --> 02:31:24,720
No more left side?

3964
02:31:24,900 --> 02:31:25,160
I'm cheating.

3965
02:31:25,480 --> 02:31:27,240
Yeah, I'm looking at it too.

3966
02:31:27,900 --> 02:31:28,980
Guys, I'm going to hit a phat ult here.

3967
02:31:30,140 --> 02:31:31,200
Oh, he's going to kill himself!

3968
02:31:40,500 --> 02:31:41,940
I see you, I see you, I see you.

3969
02:31:44,540 --> 02:31:45,140
Chase pushing in.

3970
02:31:45,740 --> 02:31:47,180
I don't have push, I don't have push.

3971
02:31:48,720 --> 02:31:49,280
No reason.

3972
02:31:49,280 --> 02:31:51,380
I ulted, I ulted, I ulted.

3973
02:31:51,820 --> 02:31:54,220
I might die though, I can die from this.

3974
02:31:57,380 --> 02:31:59,420
I pushed, I couldn't push him anywhere.

3975
02:32:01,360 --> 02:32:02,640
He was against the wall.

3976
02:32:04,940 --> 02:32:07,220
We have mantis ult here if you can.

3977
02:32:09,760 --> 02:32:10,600
I'm coming over.

3978
02:32:12,920 --> 02:32:14,220
Nice, I'm coming over now.

3979
02:32:16,660 --> 02:32:17,480
Kill the stranger.

3980
02:32:17,480 --> 02:32:18,040
Kill the stranger, I'm blocking off heals.

3981
02:32:20,140 --> 02:32:21,480
Oh my god, guys!

3982
02:32:22,500 --> 02:32:23,260
Go see him!

3983
02:32:24,260 --> 02:32:26,840
Oh my god, sorry, I celebrated too late.

3984
02:32:30,760 --> 02:32:32,000
Let's go, guys!

3985
02:32:34,020 --> 02:32:35,540
Guys, this is my first win.

3986
02:32:35,940 --> 02:32:36,900
Like, round win.

3987
02:32:42,920 --> 02:32:43,680
Good job, guys.

3988
02:32:43,760 --> 02:32:45,700
I take that as a win at that point.

3989
02:32:48,240 --> 02:32:50,040
I'm taking that as a win.

3990
02:32:53,660 --> 02:32:55,920
It's been a rough month for me.

3991
02:32:58,400 --> 02:33:01,540
Okay, how do we feel about Jeff?

3992
02:33:02,160 --> 02:33:04,080
Yeah, I can swap to Jeff if you'd like.

3993
02:33:04,240 --> 02:33:04,800
Do you want me to?

3994
02:33:05,120 --> 02:33:08,300
But I also feel like Luna must be so much better.

3995
02:33:08,420 --> 02:33:09,780
No, Luna is a lot better.

3996
02:33:10,940 --> 02:33:14,180
Listen, I've had a lot of Jeffs in my ranked games.

3997
02:33:16,120 --> 02:33:17,400
Does anyone play Jeff?

3998
02:33:17,460 --> 02:33:18,720
I don't think we play Jeff, I agree with you.

3999
02:33:19,020 --> 02:33:20,020
Wait, I actually play Jeff.

4000
02:33:20,560 --> 02:33:23,560
I play the four most useless characters in the game.

4001
02:33:25,980 --> 02:33:26,860
I'm not even kidding.

4002
02:33:31,540 --> 02:33:33,200
Do you guys want me to swap off Luna to Jeff?

4003
02:33:33,400 --> 02:33:34,740
No, no, no.

4004
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:35,940
That's what I figured.

4005
02:33:36,920 --> 02:33:39,480
I would swap Mantis for Jeff.

4006
02:33:40,420 --> 02:33:40,940
Oh, I see.

4007
02:33:43,220 --> 02:33:44,420
This is not a Jeff match.

4008
02:33:44,640 --> 02:33:45,740
Oh my god!

4009
02:33:47,280 --> 02:33:49,460
I'm on the ground with Scarra!

4010
02:33:50,780 --> 02:33:52,580
I might be dead, though.

4011
02:33:52,580 --> 02:33:53,800
Yeah, I think we lose this.

4012
02:33:54,960 --> 02:33:55,820
That's too many things.

4013
02:34:01,380 --> 02:34:03,180
I don't know what the fuck happened.

4014
02:34:03,260 --> 02:34:05,040
You guys got fucking deleted.

4015
02:34:06,060 --> 02:34:07,420
Wait, am I on the wrong side?

4016
02:34:07,500 --> 02:34:09,820
You're on the wrong side.

4017
02:34:10,840 --> 02:34:12,720
He's dead, we have to wait for you.

4018
02:34:18,080 --> 02:34:18,920
Flipped, we flipped.

4019
02:34:19,420 --> 02:34:21,080
It's fine, we don't have any...

4020
02:34:21,080 --> 02:34:22,560
We need to play slow here, get some moves.

4021
02:34:24,040 --> 02:34:25,340
Yeah, I almost have mine.

4022
02:34:25,980 --> 02:34:27,060
On my way.

4023
02:34:27,680 --> 02:34:28,860
This is a bad time to tell you guys.

4024
02:34:28,920 --> 02:34:30,560
This is my fourth time playing Invisible Woman.

4025
02:34:32,360 --> 02:34:33,120
You're gonna learn.

4026
02:34:33,740 --> 02:34:35,340
I'm learning as we go.

4027
02:34:35,980 --> 02:34:37,640
Oh, their chunk is held.

4028
02:34:39,820 --> 02:34:40,760
Kill the thing.

4029
02:34:41,540 --> 02:34:43,100
I got hit by that, I couldn't heal him.

4030
02:34:43,160 --> 02:34:43,620
It's fine.

4031
02:34:44,940 --> 02:34:45,660
He's still alive.

4032
02:34:46,400 --> 02:34:48,940
I have ult, so I don't know if you guys want me to use mine.

4033
02:34:49,420 --> 02:34:50,740
I think Moon Knight has ult.

4034
02:34:51,820 --> 02:34:53,000
Thought you wouldn't see me again.

4035
02:34:54,780 --> 02:34:55,840
I need heals down low.

4036
02:34:57,320 --> 02:34:58,480
You're up one.

4037
02:34:59,620 --> 02:35:00,240
Just play on point.

4038
02:35:00,320 --> 02:35:01,380
Just play on point with Bulgar.

4039
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:02,880
Just play on point with him.

4040
02:35:04,580 --> 02:35:05,680
I'm gonna ult us.

4041
02:35:06,060 --> 02:35:06,260
Nice!

4042
02:35:08,560 --> 02:35:10,100
Get in there more if you can.

4043
02:35:12,460 --> 02:35:13,920
Can we kill the...

4044
02:35:13,920 --> 02:35:14,880
Sorry, I'm so sorry.

4045
02:35:15,620 --> 02:35:16,800
I smashed you all.

4046
02:35:17,260 --> 02:35:17,740
Thank you.

4047
02:35:19,980 --> 02:35:21,340
I couldn't grab him.

4048
02:35:24,700 --> 02:35:25,660
Oh no.

4049
02:35:25,960 --> 02:35:26,460
Got you.

4050
02:35:29,260 --> 02:35:30,860
I need heals real quick.

4051
02:35:30,980 --> 02:35:31,500
Can you look at me?

4052
02:35:33,620 --> 02:35:33,920
I'm on strain.

4053
02:35:34,340 --> 02:35:36,160
Okay, I got you.

4054
02:35:40,540 --> 02:35:42,760
I can mash guys.

4055
02:35:44,120 --> 02:35:44,740
I'm ulting.

4056
02:35:45,520 --> 02:35:46,240
I'm on Moon Knight.

4057
02:35:47,340 --> 02:35:48,480
Their tentacles, guys.

4058
02:35:50,100 --> 02:35:50,580
I'm on them more.

4059
02:35:51,040 --> 02:35:52,040
Yeah, look into more.

4060
02:35:52,040 --> 02:35:54,340
Two swarm.

4061
02:35:54,660 --> 02:35:55,520
Nice, nice.

4062
02:35:56,280 --> 02:35:57,240
We don't need ults.

4063
02:35:58,080 --> 02:35:59,940
Wait, wait, wait.

4064
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,820
Tragedy is on me.

4065
02:36:03,300 --> 02:36:04,200
I'm pushing them away.

4066
02:36:05,360 --> 02:36:06,160
Push them.

4067
02:36:07,960 --> 02:36:08,840
Tragedy on me again.

4068
02:36:09,300 --> 02:36:10,040
Looking at strange.

4069
02:36:10,280 --> 02:36:11,660
I can heal you, don't worry.

4070
02:36:12,420 --> 02:36:13,560
Get strange if you can.

4071
02:36:15,020 --> 02:36:15,300
I got you.

4072
02:36:18,120 --> 02:36:18,660
Mantis.

4073
02:36:19,300 --> 02:36:20,140
Change one.

4074
02:36:21,280 --> 02:36:22,140
Stroke is strange.

4075
02:36:22,300 --> 02:36:23,000
He's so low.

4076
02:36:23,540 --> 02:36:25,360
He's literally by himself, jaywalking.

4077
02:36:26,160 --> 02:36:27,160
Next to me.

4078
02:36:30,660 --> 02:36:31,620
He's fucking...

4079
02:36:31,620 --> 02:36:33,260
We have sualt if we need it.

4080
02:36:33,400 --> 02:36:34,980
Yeah, I saved my sualt for this.

4081
02:36:36,180 --> 02:36:37,380
I got my ult as well here, guys.

4082
02:36:37,700 --> 02:36:38,820
I need heals.

4083
02:36:39,840 --> 02:36:42,020
I have my ult.

4084
02:36:43,940 --> 02:36:46,380
If they push on point...

4085
02:36:46,380 --> 02:36:46,980
I'm using my ult.

4086
02:36:46,980 --> 02:36:47,700
Come to me.

4087
02:36:52,760 --> 02:36:54,280
We win this.

4088
02:36:54,760 --> 02:36:55,100
He heals.

4089
02:36:55,900 --> 02:36:56,980
Use ult.

4090
02:36:59,980 --> 02:37:01,880
I killed everyone.

4091
02:37:02,700 --> 02:37:03,400
It's winnable.

4092
02:37:03,820 --> 02:37:04,920
It's fine.

4093
02:37:05,500 --> 02:37:06,620
Focus on the more.

4094
02:37:09,360 --> 02:37:11,080
The more high ground.

4095
02:37:13,480 --> 02:37:14,900
Oh my god.

4096
02:37:14,900 --> 02:37:15,980
We did it!

4097
02:37:16,500 --> 02:37:19,820
We played so well.

4098
02:37:20,100 --> 02:37:21,500
Oh my god.

4099
02:37:22,540 --> 02:37:24,020
We did it, guys.

4100
02:37:24,820 --> 02:37:26,640
Oh my god.

4101
02:37:26,700 --> 02:37:27,860
I did this.

4102
02:37:27,880 --> 02:37:28,800
Good job.

4103
02:37:29,840 --> 02:37:31,560
I just strange diffed him so hard.

4104
02:37:31,780 --> 02:37:35,180
Yes, and also, I think Boger just needed to be happy.

4105
02:37:35,680 --> 02:37:38,520
He needed the positive vibes.

4106
02:37:39,180 --> 02:37:39,780
Yes.

4107
02:37:40,700 --> 02:37:42,340
The curse is broken.

4108
02:37:42,340 --> 02:37:43,340
I'm not crying.

4109
02:37:43,760 --> 02:37:47,060
Oh, for sure.

4110
02:37:47,680 --> 02:37:49,640
We just made it.

4111
02:37:49,820 --> 02:37:51,560
We just wanted to make the game more fair, right?

4112
02:37:51,900 --> 02:37:52,800
Oh, right.

4113
02:37:54,440 --> 02:37:56,120
Oh my god.

4114
02:37:57,480 --> 02:37:58,440
No more depression.

4115
02:37:59,300 --> 02:37:59,720
I know.

4116
02:38:00,800 --> 02:38:01,920
It's that easy.

4117
02:38:02,300 --> 02:38:03,120
It's that easy.

4118
02:38:03,320 --> 02:38:05,240
I'm happy for the rest of my day.

4119
02:38:06,640 --> 02:38:07,940
We just started.

4120
02:38:09,240 --> 02:38:10,600
I'm happy now.

4121
02:38:12,340 --> 02:38:13,800
I was on the biggest lose streak.

4122
02:38:14,340 --> 02:38:15,240
Let's go!

4123
02:38:15,620 --> 02:38:16,520
We broke it.

4124
02:38:16,740 --> 02:38:17,580
We did it.

4125
02:38:17,720 --> 02:38:18,720
We did it, Nora.

4126
02:38:20,540 --> 02:38:24,320
I thought it was going to go 0-10 for the rest of the day.

4127
02:38:25,920 --> 02:38:28,660
Is there a reward for going 0-10?

4128
02:38:29,440 --> 02:38:30,400
That's crazy.

4129
02:38:32,320 --> 02:38:34,000
I'll take that 1-9.

4130
02:38:34,160 --> 02:38:35,000
I'll take it.

4131
02:38:36,680 --> 02:38:37,880
That was crazy, guys.

4132
02:38:37,940 --> 02:38:38,520
You played well.

4133
02:38:38,520 --> 02:38:39,400
You popped off, guys.

4134
02:38:40,060 --> 02:38:41,920
It's just that easy to cure depression.

4135
02:38:42,660 --> 02:38:44,520
You made a crazy Udyr.

4136
02:38:44,980 --> 02:38:47,120
I strangled 4 of them at the end.

4137
02:38:47,260 --> 02:38:48,040
I killed everyone.

4138
02:38:48,740 --> 02:38:52,000
Yeah, you should have just played estranged the entire time.

4139
02:38:52,140 --> 02:38:54,940
I like how xQc was triple support, crutch.

4140
02:38:55,860 --> 02:38:57,220
We needed this, though.

4141
02:38:57,560 --> 02:38:58,860
We needed the crutch.

4142
02:38:59,380 --> 02:39:00,460
We needed the crutch, yeah.

4143
02:39:01,860 --> 02:39:02,700
Jesus Christ.

4144
02:39:02,820 --> 02:39:03,840
He has Trowd.

4145
02:39:04,260 --> 02:39:05,960
Come on, you have Trowd.

4146
02:39:05,960 --> 02:39:08,000
Yep, we're playing against each other in 3 days.

4147
02:39:08,260 --> 02:39:08,980
Let's recap tomorrow.

4148
02:39:10,100 --> 02:39:11,000
GG's, guys.

4149
02:39:12,440 --> 02:39:13,120
GG's, good luck.

4150
02:39:14,140 --> 02:39:15,140
Good luck, everybody.

4151
02:39:17,500 --> 02:39:18,660
Oh my god.

4152
02:39:19,140 --> 02:39:21,200
I like how we're the only team that just left.

4153
02:39:22,380 --> 02:39:24,380
We didn't have to leave.

4154
02:39:24,760 --> 02:39:27,600
Everybody else was still in their fucking lobby.

4155
02:39:30,440 --> 02:39:34,720
Guys, I keep forgetting that you shift on invisible.

4156
02:39:34,720 --> 02:39:37,620
That was literally the 4th time I've ever played.

4157
02:39:37,740 --> 02:39:38,360
Okay, let me see.

4158
02:39:38,520 --> 02:39:39,060
Actually, I'm curious.

4159
02:39:39,200 --> 02:39:40,600
How many times have I played invisible woman?

4160
02:39:41,120 --> 02:39:41,900
I'm actually curious.

4161
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:43,680
I played her like once in ranked game.

4162
02:39:43,820 --> 02:39:47,220
I think I've only played her once in ranked.

4163
02:39:47,320 --> 02:39:48,680
I'm pretty sure.

4164
02:39:49,220 --> 02:39:49,700
Statistics.

4165
02:39:50,960 --> 02:39:52,200
There we go.

4166
02:39:52,640 --> 02:39:56,600
My 4th game on invisible woman.

4167
02:39:57,020 --> 02:39:58,420
That's literally it.

4168
02:40:00,300 --> 02:40:01,900
I told you guys.

4169
02:40:01,900 --> 02:40:05,380
This is actually my 4th game on her.

4170
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:14,100
It's not muscle memory for me.

4171
02:40:14,300 --> 02:40:14,700
The shift.

4172
02:40:16,580 --> 02:40:19,040
Not even a full game.

4173
02:40:20,860 --> 02:40:22,820
Oh my god.

4174
02:40:22,940 --> 02:40:24,400
This is not fantastic.

4175
02:40:24,700 --> 02:40:28,220
Zero rocket hours and we're keeping it that way.

4176
02:40:32,480 --> 02:40:33,460
Two minutes?

4177
02:40:33,600 --> 02:40:34,500
Yeah, two minutes.

4178
02:40:34,740 --> 02:40:36,360
I wouldn't use Jeff to stall.

4179
02:40:36,520 --> 02:40:38,460
To swim back to the...

4180
02:40:38,460 --> 02:40:41,340
To swim to the place.

4181
02:40:41,740 --> 02:40:43,740
If it's last overtime.

4182
02:40:44,300 --> 02:40:45,280
And we need to support.

4183
02:40:45,580 --> 02:40:47,280
We need to support over fast.

4184
02:40:48,060 --> 02:40:50,000
I just swim over as fast as I can.

4185
02:40:50,240 --> 02:40:52,440
I have a better win rate on Cloak than I do on Luna.

4186
02:40:52,840 --> 02:40:53,800
It's so sad.

4187
02:40:57,760 --> 02:40:59,260
And also, yeah.

4188
02:41:00,880 --> 02:41:01,880
I'm competitive.

4189
02:41:02,420 --> 02:41:05,760
Yeah, I have a better win rate on...

4190
02:41:07,060 --> 02:41:10,680
No, I will never.

4191
02:41:11,140 --> 02:41:11,520
Look at that.

4192
02:41:11,600 --> 02:41:13,300
No, my Atom is where it's at.

4193
02:41:14,440 --> 02:41:16,260
100% win rate.

4194
02:41:16,720 --> 02:41:17,640
Right here.

4195
02:41:21,020 --> 02:41:23,600
But yeah, that's actually my 4th game on...

4196
02:41:25,780 --> 02:41:26,660
Like I said.

4197
02:41:26,660 --> 02:41:28,000
I feel like even if...

4198
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:31,600
Even if Invisible Woman is not my strongest support.

4199
02:41:32,100 --> 02:41:34,740
I'd rather put our lower ranked players...

4200
02:41:35,300 --> 02:41:37,000
I'd rather put our lower ranked players...

4201
02:41:37,460 --> 02:41:39,620
On their best support character.

4202
02:41:40,260 --> 02:41:42,140
Instead of like...

4203
02:41:42,140 --> 02:41:45,120
Putting them on something they're not comfortable with.

4204
02:41:45,620 --> 02:41:47,000
Because like...

4205
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:47,500
My...

4206
02:41:47,500 --> 02:41:49,020
I feel like my...

4207
02:41:49,020 --> 02:41:51,960
My Invisible Woman...

4208
02:41:51,960 --> 02:41:53,240
Because they're my...

4209
02:41:53,240 --> 02:41:54,380
Not my worst one.

4210
02:41:54,520 --> 02:41:55,580
Because like, I don't know.

4211
02:41:55,680 --> 02:41:57,960
I feel like my other support might be worse.

4212
02:41:59,300 --> 02:42:01,020
I feel like...

4213
02:42:01,020 --> 02:42:02,540
My game sense...

4214
02:42:02,540 --> 02:42:04,140
In a higher ELO...

4215
02:42:04,140 --> 02:42:06,420
Can easily transfer...

4216
02:42:06,420 --> 02:42:08,000
To other supports.

4217
02:42:08,200 --> 02:42:10,460
So I can just transfer it better.

4218
02:42:11,480 --> 02:42:12,640
Like knowledge wise.

4219
02:42:12,980 --> 02:42:13,420
And stuff.

4220
02:42:15,740 --> 02:42:17,480
Yeah, I can make use of...

4221
02:42:17,480 --> 02:42:18,200
Like my pulls.

4222
02:42:18,480 --> 02:42:20,340
I felt like my pulls...

4223
02:42:20,340 --> 02:42:21,560
And my pushes...

4224
02:42:21,560 --> 02:42:23,420
Clutched some of the matches there.

4225
02:42:23,820 --> 02:42:25,340
Where I like pulled...

4226
02:42:25,840 --> 02:42:28,540
I like pulled and pushed...

4227
02:42:28,540 --> 02:42:30,040
Some of the players...

4228
02:42:30,040 --> 02:42:32,140
Like some of the enemy members towards us.

4229
02:42:32,220 --> 02:42:33,540
And we got picks because of it.

4230
02:42:34,940 --> 02:42:36,340
And I felt like I could...

4231
02:42:36,340 --> 02:42:37,800
Like I was able to do that.

4232
02:42:38,240 --> 02:42:40,860
I feel like me being on Invisible Woman...

4233
02:42:40,860 --> 02:42:41,260
Helped us.

4234
02:42:41,560 --> 02:42:42,960
I'm happy for the rest of the day.

4235
02:42:43,020 --> 02:42:44,400
I actually went in thinking like...

4236
02:42:44,400 --> 02:42:45,540
Oh man, I'm gonna get 0-10.

4237
02:42:51,180 --> 02:42:52,140
Yeah, yeah.

4238
02:42:52,240 --> 02:42:53,580
I was just like...

4239
02:42:53,580 --> 02:42:56,180
I literally went in thinking I was gonna get 0-10.

4240
02:42:56,260 --> 02:42:57,620
So I'm happy, you know.

4241
02:42:57,800 --> 02:42:59,140
I'm actually...

4242
02:42:59,140 --> 02:43:01,620
I'm happy for the rest of the day.

4243
02:43:07,740 --> 02:43:09,900
I'm undooming, that's how it works.

4244
02:43:11,600 --> 02:43:12,080
Like...

4245
02:43:13,900 --> 02:43:15,460
I don't know, they're like...

4246
02:43:15,460 --> 02:43:17,080
Doki, why are you dooming?

4247
02:43:17,080 --> 02:43:19,120
And I'm like, I don't know.

4248
02:43:19,460 --> 02:43:20,700
I feel like this...

4249
02:43:20,700 --> 02:43:23,080
You can't...

4250
02:43:24,380 --> 02:43:27,080
With this record...

4251
02:43:31,840 --> 02:43:33,880
It's a little hard to be positive.

4252
02:43:37,040 --> 02:43:38,220
Guys, guys, guys.

4253
02:43:38,680 --> 02:43:40,360
Guys, this looks a lot better though.

4254
02:43:43,400 --> 02:43:45,380
Guys, this looks a lot better though.

4255
02:43:45,380 --> 02:43:46,360
As long as we don't...

4256
02:43:46,360 --> 02:43:49,580
As long as we don't look at this part.

4257
02:43:52,460 --> 02:43:53,400
Much better.

4258
02:43:54,180 --> 02:43:55,560
We kept the streak.

4259
02:43:55,920 --> 02:43:57,960
xQc has yet to win a game against me.

4260
02:43:58,700 --> 02:44:00,440
He hasn't won a game with me too.

4261
02:44:00,540 --> 02:44:02,060
But like, that's...

4262
02:44:03,780 --> 02:44:05,880
That still counts, guys.

4263
02:44:06,160 --> 02:44:08,700
That technically still counts.

4264
02:44:09,520 --> 02:44:10,760
Kept the streak going.

4265
02:44:11,740 --> 02:44:12,480
Thank god.

4266
02:44:12,480 --> 02:44:14,260
Actually, thank god.

4267
02:44:18,480 --> 02:44:20,380
I don't know why we all just left.

4268
02:44:22,700 --> 02:44:23,760
Why did we all like...

4269
02:44:23,760 --> 02:44:25,720
We were the only ones that left our lobby.

4270
02:44:25,880 --> 02:44:26,740
I just realized.

4271
02:44:27,600 --> 02:44:28,800
Doki, come back.

4272
02:44:29,720 --> 02:44:30,240
What?

4273
02:44:31,020 --> 02:44:32,620
Doki, you won the game with me.

4274
02:44:33,460 --> 02:44:35,720
I also lost a game with you.

4275
02:44:36,140 --> 02:44:36,840
I have never...

4276
02:44:36,840 --> 02:44:40,840
Listen, I have never diffed somebody as hard as I diffed Dexter.

4277
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:41,900
That was insane.

4278
02:44:42,460 --> 02:44:43,860
Yeah, but we're playing against you.

4279
02:44:44,040 --> 02:44:45,180
We're playing against you again.

4280
02:44:45,800 --> 02:44:46,520
Get out of here.

4281
02:44:46,840 --> 02:44:50,500
I'm playing against you next game.

4282
02:44:51,020 --> 02:44:51,740
Come to the lobby.

4283
02:44:51,840 --> 02:44:52,220
Where are you?

4284
02:44:53,080 --> 02:44:54,080
I'm here now.

4285
02:44:55,240 --> 02:44:59,060
I'm pretty sure the other team hasn't finished their game yet.

4286
02:44:59,980 --> 02:45:00,540
Yeah, we're chilling.

4287
02:45:00,760 --> 02:45:01,520
We're just chatting.

4288
02:45:04,240 --> 02:45:06,760
Did you think we were going to win that game?

4289
02:45:06,760 --> 02:45:07,700
No.

4290
02:45:07,700 --> 02:45:11,060
I was actually so locked in.

4291
02:45:11,560 --> 02:45:13,800
You know those moments when you play competitive games?

4292
02:45:14,360 --> 02:45:15,900
I was in the flow.

4293
02:45:16,200 --> 02:45:19,460
You literally got through the 4k that last round.

4294
02:45:22,600 --> 02:45:24,300
He couldn't hit a single fucking ult.

4295
02:45:25,160 --> 02:45:26,280
That's crazy.

4296
02:45:26,700 --> 02:45:27,660
No, he held his ult.

4297
02:45:28,600 --> 02:45:29,680
I was saving my push.

4298
02:45:30,020 --> 02:45:32,280
My pressure was greater.

4299
02:45:32,460 --> 02:45:34,140
I literally waited for so long to push him.

4300
02:45:34,140 --> 02:45:36,020
But he held his ult for the longest time.

4301
02:45:36,300 --> 02:45:37,220
I was so confused.

4302
02:45:37,700 --> 02:45:45,620
I was looking at my stats in my chat and that was literally the 4th time I've ever played Invisible.

4303
02:45:45,920 --> 02:45:46,060
What?

4304
02:45:47,440 --> 02:45:48,280
You're the best.

4305
02:45:49,460 --> 02:45:50,860
I was just like, hey guys.

4306
02:45:51,160 --> 02:45:53,820
My first win on Invisible Women.

4307
02:45:57,580 --> 02:45:59,660
I think we were the first team that finished too.

4308
02:45:59,900 --> 02:46:00,920
Everybody's still playing.

4309
02:46:08,230 --> 02:46:09,310
You know your team?

4310
02:46:09,470 --> 02:46:10,230
You know your team for the next round?

4311
02:46:11,270 --> 02:46:12,510
Actually, we're pretty stacked I think.

4312
02:46:13,410 --> 02:46:14,890
Our team is pretty stacked too.

4313
02:46:15,250 --> 02:46:16,390
What are you talking about?

4314
02:46:17,210 --> 02:46:18,230
You don't have tank players.

4315
02:46:18,890 --> 02:46:19,350
Oh shit.

4316
02:46:19,450 --> 02:46:20,450
No, we have Coney's tank player.

4317
02:46:20,970 --> 02:46:21,630
Coney's tank player.

4318
02:46:21,970 --> 02:46:24,010
I'm not telling you.

4319
02:46:25,090 --> 02:46:26,790
I'm not fucking telling you.

4320
02:46:29,730 --> 02:46:32,310
Oh, apparently SK's match went to overtime.

4321
02:46:34,890 --> 02:46:36,690
That's what we're waiting on.

4322
02:46:42,730 --> 02:46:43,750
Oh man.

4323
02:46:44,190 --> 02:46:46,070
Coney is our only tank.

4324
02:46:46,230 --> 02:46:49,050
The only issue is that we have to ban Strange.

4325
02:46:49,990 --> 02:46:52,250
I'm just going to tell my team to ban Strange.

4326
02:46:53,390 --> 02:46:57,830
Because I think Bogr on Strange is literally the carry.

4327
02:46:58,730 --> 02:47:00,830
I think if he was on Hulk, I'll just...

4328
02:47:00,830 --> 02:47:05,810
Unless Bogr bans Luna, I can just freeze Hulk on cooldown.

4329
02:47:06,030 --> 02:47:08,510
Because that's what I did to him and he wasn't having a good time.

4330
02:47:19,090 --> 02:47:20,650
So that's really it.

4331
02:47:20,770 --> 02:47:23,510
As long as he doesn't ban Luna, then we should be fine.

4332
02:47:24,150 --> 02:47:27,230
I can just freeze him on cooldown if he's on Hulk.

4333
02:47:27,770 --> 02:47:29,710
Or we just ban Hulk second.

4334
02:47:29,710 --> 02:47:35,450
Because honestly, nobody else is someone I'm like, oh man, I gotta worry about that.

4335
02:47:35,570 --> 02:47:36,870
In terms of ban-wise.

4336
02:47:37,050 --> 02:47:38,670
They have all the DPS players though.

4337
02:47:39,310 --> 02:47:41,530
Their team is literally just DPS players.

4338
02:47:42,730 --> 02:47:43,690
Bogr's team.

4339
02:47:46,170 --> 02:47:47,410
Bogr's team is literally...

4340
02:47:47,410 --> 02:47:53,110
It's like Masayoshi, Qtpie, Nora, Tariq, and Shoto.

4341
02:47:53,370 --> 02:47:54,570
They're all DPS players.

4342
02:47:55,070 --> 02:47:57,710
And my team actually has...

4343
02:47:57,710 --> 02:48:01,710
I mean, Coney and Scarra can both play tank.

4344
02:48:02,350 --> 02:48:05,530
And me and Sleepy can play DPS if he feels like it today.

4345
02:48:06,610 --> 02:48:09,790
I just play low-key because that's basically DPS.

4346
02:48:16,960 --> 02:48:17,580
But...

4347
02:48:17,580 --> 02:48:18,240
Yeah.

4348
02:48:18,820 --> 02:48:20,580
I feel a lot better.

4349
02:48:21,420 --> 02:48:22,740
I feel like...

4350
02:48:24,840 --> 02:48:25,770
I feel...

4351
02:48:27,160 --> 02:48:28,980
Legitimately, I was like, oh man.

4352
02:48:28,980 --> 02:48:32,000
But now I'm like, Yay!

4353
02:48:33,320 --> 02:48:36,980
Maybe things aren't that bad in life.

4354
02:48:39,080 --> 02:48:42,220
My depression is cured.

4355
02:48:42,740 --> 02:48:44,980
It only takes one thing.

4356
02:48:45,460 --> 02:48:46,980
No longer demoralized.

4357
02:48:50,840 --> 02:48:59,280
I mean, when your teammates were dying on cooldown and I was practically like, you know, I had to like...

4358
02:49:01,400 --> 02:49:03,060
I was just, you know...

4359
02:49:03,060 --> 02:49:06,960
I was literally just fucking begging for heals.

4360
02:49:07,680 --> 02:49:09,140
Doki, can you invite me into the lobby again?

4361
02:49:09,280 --> 02:49:10,160
Because I...

4362
02:49:10,160 --> 02:49:13,200
It was pretty rough.

4363
02:49:15,460 --> 02:49:16,500
Yeah, I can.

4364
02:49:17,160 --> 02:49:18,140
Wait, but you're not leader anymore.

4365
02:49:18,160 --> 02:49:18,700
Oh wait, I'm leader.

4366
02:49:18,980 --> 02:49:20,420
I'll just invite you back in.

4367
02:49:23,660 --> 02:49:25,020
And then I'll give you leader.

4368
02:49:26,040 --> 02:49:26,480
Wait.

4369
02:49:26,760 --> 02:49:27,980
Wait, I can give you leader.

4370
02:49:28,160 --> 02:49:29,120
I don't think you can.

4371
02:49:29,880 --> 02:49:32,140
I think you have to create it yourself.

4372
02:49:34,040 --> 02:49:35,160
Yeah, doesn't matter.

4373
02:49:38,040 --> 02:49:39,740
It won't let you give leader.

4374
02:49:39,920 --> 02:49:41,440
Wait, that's so dumb.

4375
02:49:41,640 --> 02:49:41,880
What?

4376
02:49:42,500 --> 02:49:43,500
That's actually so dumb.

4377
02:49:46,100 --> 02:49:49,880
But yeah, someone said leave and RNG it, but like, that's not worth.

4378
02:49:50,180 --> 02:49:51,820
I feel like RNG is not going to go to you.

4379
02:49:56,140 --> 02:49:56,580
Hmm.

4380
02:49:57,300 --> 02:49:58,800
I'm going to leave and see if it goes to you.

4381
02:50:02,190 --> 02:50:03,890
Did you get it?

4382
02:50:04,510 --> 02:50:04,710
Yeah.

4383
02:50:05,070 --> 02:50:05,710
Oh, nice.

4384
02:50:06,730 --> 02:50:08,110
Alright, invite me back in.

4385
02:50:19,020 --> 02:50:20,660
Where the fuck is my room, booger?

4386
02:50:31,670 --> 02:50:34,930
How do we make the other person team leader then?

4387
02:50:35,170 --> 02:50:35,970
Or the other team?

4388
02:50:37,070 --> 02:50:37,890
I don't know.

4389
02:50:40,470 --> 02:50:42,890
Do I just have to not be at the... Oh, I need to invite you.

4390
02:50:42,890 --> 02:50:44,810
Why does this person keep leaving the lobby?

4391
02:50:44,970 --> 02:50:45,770
I'm so confused.

4392
02:50:46,770 --> 02:50:47,290
What?

4393
02:50:49,550 --> 02:50:50,330
I'm confused.

4394
02:50:50,690 --> 02:50:51,510
Are you in the room, Doki?

4395
02:50:51,690 --> 02:50:54,330
Yeah, I'm literally in your room right now.

4396
02:50:55,370 --> 02:50:55,550
Okay.

4397
02:50:56,070 --> 02:50:57,570
Who is missing?

4398
02:50:58,110 --> 02:51:00,870
Like, the rest of the other team.

4399
02:51:02,110 --> 02:51:02,630
Like...

4400
02:51:02,630 --> 02:51:03,490
Sleepy's team.

4401
02:51:04,910 --> 02:51:07,030
They're still in a game right now.

4402
02:51:07,450 --> 02:51:07,730
They are?

4403
02:51:07,910 --> 02:51:10,650
Yeah, because SK's team went overtime.

4404
02:51:22,200 --> 02:51:23,140
Oh my god.

4405
02:51:23,200 --> 02:51:23,740
I'm so happy.

4406
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:26,500
Void has also lost at almost all his games.

4407
02:51:26,680 --> 02:51:27,320
Just like me.

4408
02:51:29,120 --> 02:51:30,620
Just like me as well.

4409
02:51:31,440 --> 02:51:32,520
Oh my god.

4410
02:51:33,440 --> 02:51:34,620
We both won one.

4411
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:38,100
Oh no.

4412
02:51:39,500 --> 02:51:40,800
I just...

4413
02:51:40,800 --> 02:51:44,720
Masayoshi has won four out of his five games.

4414
02:51:45,520 --> 02:51:47,120
Must be...

4415
02:51:47,120 --> 02:51:48,240
Must feel great.

4416
02:51:48,240 --> 02:51:48,460
That's crazy.

4417
02:51:50,840 --> 02:51:52,320
Yeah, and he's on your team.

4418
02:51:54,200 --> 02:51:55,820
Must feel great.

4419
02:51:56,820 --> 02:51:58,200
Wait, Tariq has won...

4420
02:51:58,200 --> 02:51:58,460
Wait.

4421
02:51:59,860 --> 02:52:00,660
No, what?

4422
02:52:00,860 --> 02:52:01,140
Half...

4423
02:52:02,640 --> 02:52:04,000
Who's Halfu's replacement?

4424
02:52:06,300 --> 02:52:07,260
Is it QT?

4425
02:52:07,460 --> 02:52:08,220
What do you mean replacement?

4426
02:52:08,840 --> 02:52:09,580
Halfu's playing now.

4427
02:52:10,080 --> 02:52:11,100
Is Halfu playing?

4428
02:52:11,360 --> 02:52:12,740
I played with Halfu.

4429
02:52:12,960 --> 02:52:13,560
First game we played.

4430
02:52:13,640 --> 02:52:15,500
I thought Halfu got replaced by...

4431
02:52:16,300 --> 02:52:17,020
Wait, nevermind.

4432
02:52:17,540 --> 02:52:20,360
I thought Halfu was the one that got replaced earlier.

4433
02:52:21,440 --> 02:52:22,440
It was someone else.

4434
02:52:22,860 --> 02:52:24,100
It was Myth that got replaced.

4435
02:52:42,100 --> 02:52:43,960
Guys, I'm looking at the scores right now.

4436
02:52:44,120 --> 02:52:45,320
I'm not going to link it to you guys.

4437
02:52:45,560 --> 02:52:46,640
Because, you know...

4438
02:52:49,640 --> 02:52:51,040
I'm not going to link it to you guys.

4439
02:52:51,100 --> 02:52:53,800
Because I still want some joy in my life.

4440
02:52:57,180 --> 02:52:59,440
But some people don't have the link.

4441
02:53:00,420 --> 02:53:02,380
Some people don't have the link.

4442
02:53:02,500 --> 02:53:04,440
And I prefer to keep it that way.

4443
02:53:04,500 --> 02:53:07,100
I have one point.

4444
02:53:07,300 --> 02:53:08,640
Guys, come on.

4445
02:53:08,980 --> 02:53:10,920
We're not progressing to the finals.

4446
02:53:11,280 --> 02:53:13,940
But at least I have one point.

4447
02:53:14,320 --> 02:53:15,720
And that's all that matters.

4448
02:53:15,840 --> 02:53:17,240
It must be nice to...

4449
02:53:17,240 --> 02:53:19,800
It must be nice to not be a support player.

4450
02:53:20,140 --> 02:53:21,120
It must be nice.

4451
02:53:26,260 --> 02:53:27,520
Maybe I'll get Eternity.

4452
02:53:27,520 --> 02:53:28,040
Maybe I'll get Eternity.

4453
02:53:28,320 --> 02:53:31,820
To make it feel better.

4454
02:53:34,640 --> 02:53:37,300
That one singular point.

4455
02:53:37,920 --> 02:53:40,380
I beat xQc and Shroud.

4456
02:53:41,340 --> 02:53:43,180
Who's winning here?

4457
02:53:45,180 --> 02:53:47,460
Some of them only fought xQc.

4458
02:53:47,720 --> 02:53:49,120
Some of them only fought Shroud.

4459
02:53:49,420 --> 02:53:52,860
But I fought both xQc and Shroud.

4460
02:53:53,140 --> 02:53:54,460
And won.

4461
02:53:55,700 --> 02:53:57,660
And I guess Tariq too.

4462
02:53:59,100 --> 02:54:01,340
I'm sorry, but Tariq is a great guy.

4463
02:54:02,280 --> 02:54:05,180
He's just randomly catching strays right now.

4464
02:54:08,200 --> 02:54:11,880
Those three were all on the same team together.

4465
02:54:12,120 --> 02:54:13,660
And I still made it.

4466
02:54:13,860 --> 02:54:15,380
I still made it out.

4467
02:54:15,380 --> 02:54:15,480
That's a good start.

4468
02:54:24,910 --> 02:54:26,030
Round 3?

4469
02:54:26,150 --> 02:54:27,310
How are they on round 3?

4470
02:54:28,410 --> 02:54:29,470
It's best of 2!

4471
02:54:29,750 --> 02:54:30,910
It's two maps!

4472
02:54:32,850 --> 02:54:33,950
You play two games!

4473
02:54:36,390 --> 02:54:38,270
Oh they didn't get past their other.

4474
02:54:38,570 --> 02:54:38,850
Yeah.

4475
02:54:39,850 --> 02:54:42,350
That one point was worth the entire day.

4476
02:54:42,510 --> 02:54:42,770
Yeah.

4477
02:54:46,490 --> 02:54:49,730
Yeah, I just need to make sure I don't play Invisible Woman again.

4478
02:54:49,950 --> 02:54:52,450
That's not true, we lost like the other round.

4479
02:54:52,470 --> 02:54:54,950
It's like a 50% invisible win rate.

4480
02:54:55,310 --> 02:54:57,770
Because we lost that other game on Invisible Woman.

4481
02:54:58,310 --> 02:55:00,070
You know, the first round, we lost that.

4482
02:55:00,550 --> 02:55:02,070
So like, that's not true guys.

4483
02:55:02,850 --> 02:55:04,610
We've already tainted it.

4484
02:55:17,960 --> 02:55:19,020
I'm just happy.

4485
02:55:19,800 --> 02:55:21,180
I'm happy we made it out.

4486
02:55:25,100 --> 02:55:25,620
That's true.

4487
02:55:25,920 --> 02:55:28,420
That game was a warm-up to figure out how to play her.

4488
02:55:30,780 --> 02:55:31,960
That is so true.

4489
02:55:32,500 --> 02:55:35,120
I had to figure out her mechanics there.

4490
02:55:39,620 --> 02:55:41,100
I would love to play the finals.

4491
02:55:41,300 --> 02:55:43,600
I think if I got a chance to play the finals, it would have been so fun.

4492
02:55:44,720 --> 02:55:45,220
In general.

4493
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:47,740
But like, it is what it is.

4494
02:55:47,740 --> 02:55:53,680
There can only be two teams that make it out.

4495
02:55:54,920 --> 02:55:56,640
It is what it is.

4496
02:55:58,840 --> 02:56:02,200
I mean, it's nice just to talk to people I usually never talk to before.

4497
02:56:02,480 --> 02:56:03,540
I still can't believe my Discord.

4498
02:56:03,640 --> 02:56:05,820
I'm sorry that you guys don't know who's talking and stuff.

4499
02:56:06,280 --> 02:56:12,080
And all the cool big name people that were with us and stuff.

4500
02:56:12,160 --> 02:56:13,020
Wait, let me see.

4501
02:56:13,500 --> 02:56:15,940
If I refresh this, does it fix it?

4502
02:56:16,620 --> 02:56:16,960
Maybe?

4503
02:56:17,740 --> 02:56:19,620
No, it still breaks it.

4504
02:56:19,820 --> 02:56:22,240
I don't know why my Discord is broken.

4505
02:56:22,560 --> 02:56:24,060
Like, I don't know why.

4506
02:56:24,320 --> 02:56:27,580
I feel like if I restarted my PC, maybe it would work.

4507
02:56:28,040 --> 02:56:29,620
But, oh my god.

4508
02:56:29,800 --> 02:56:31,080
I'm so mad.

4509
02:56:31,600 --> 02:56:33,220
I'm so mad.

4510
02:56:34,040 --> 02:56:35,180
I'm so mad.

4511
02:56:35,680 --> 02:56:36,740
Now it works.

4512
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:41,720
But not the way I want it to.

4513
02:56:41,880 --> 02:56:43,540
I'm so mad.

4514
02:56:43,860 --> 02:56:45,660
I'm so angry.

4515
02:56:45,660 --> 02:56:48,820
I'm so, oh my god, I'm so mad.

4516
02:56:53,000 --> 02:56:53,680
Alright,

4517
02:56:57,020 --> 02:56:59,060
let me see if I can do it.

4518
02:56:59,160 --> 02:57:00,280
Okay, let's see.

4519
02:57:03,840 --> 02:57:04,880
I'm here.

4520
02:57:05,120 --> 02:57:05,380
Hello.

4521
02:57:07,320 --> 02:57:07,760
Hello.

4522
02:57:11,270 --> 02:57:12,770
Hello again, booger.

4523
02:57:13,470 --> 02:57:14,690
Oh, it doesn't work.

4524
02:57:14,930 --> 02:57:15,850
This is the...

4525
02:57:15,850 --> 02:57:16,610
Who's our team?

4526
02:57:16,810 --> 02:57:16,950
Let me see.

4527
02:57:18,950 --> 02:57:19,750
Not me.

4528
02:57:19,950 --> 02:57:20,730
I'm just crashing.

4529
02:57:22,170 --> 02:57:25,850
Because I think my lobby people are...

4530
02:57:26,450 --> 02:57:28,350
Yeah, we just finished up.

4531
02:57:31,750 --> 02:57:32,630
Wait, wait.

4532
02:57:36,970 --> 02:57:38,530
Cody, I also play Mr. Fantastic.

4533
02:57:39,150 --> 02:57:40,510
No, Scarra, I'm sorry.

4534
02:57:41,070 --> 02:57:42,550
Scarra, you're on tank duty.

4535
02:57:44,370 --> 02:57:44,790
Oh!

4536
02:57:44,790 --> 02:57:45,850
You're on tank duty.

4537
02:57:46,010 --> 02:57:48,310
I do not have two players that go, I like Mr. Fantastic.

4538
02:57:48,770 --> 02:57:49,110
That's great.

4539
02:57:51,610 --> 02:57:52,750
What can I say?

4540
02:57:52,910 --> 02:57:53,510
He's fun, bro.

4541
02:57:53,630 --> 02:57:54,090
He's fun.

4542
02:57:54,930 --> 02:57:57,390
Sleepy, let me tell you my character pool.

4543
02:57:57,970 --> 02:57:58,350
I play...

4544
02:57:58,350 --> 02:57:59,670
I was actually asking about this.

4545
02:57:59,750 --> 02:58:00,190
Let's hear it.

4546
02:58:00,290 --> 02:58:03,570
I play Penny, Mr. Fantastic, Adam Warlock.

4547
02:58:03,890 --> 02:58:05,230
Okay, so not a single useful character.

4548
02:58:05,390 --> 02:58:05,550
Alright.

4549
02:58:06,070 --> 02:58:06,330
What?

4550
02:58:06,630 --> 02:58:07,510
What's your favorite character?

4551
02:58:09,330 --> 02:58:10,970
Who do you think you're going to play the best on?

4552
02:58:10,970 --> 02:58:13,050
Because that's not everyone they're comfortable on, honestly.

4553
02:58:14,430 --> 02:58:15,490
I don't want to make anybody like Scarra.

4554
02:58:15,490 --> 02:58:16,610
Alright, who do I need to invite?

4555
02:58:17,910 --> 02:58:18,110
Me.

4556
02:58:18,310 --> 02:58:19,490
Scarra, who do you like?

4557
02:58:19,550 --> 02:58:21,470
The other problem is, do we have a tank player?

4558
02:58:22,570 --> 02:58:23,570
Cody plays tank.

4559
02:58:24,590 --> 02:58:25,390
Hi, Doki!

4560
02:58:25,510 --> 02:58:26,390
Cody plays tank.

4561
02:58:26,470 --> 02:58:27,910
Yeah, Cody, I'm calling you out.

4562
02:58:27,950 --> 02:58:28,890
You're not playing Mr. Fantastic.

4563
02:58:29,270 --> 02:58:29,990
You're on tank duty.

4564
02:58:30,010 --> 02:58:30,630
No, I'm playing Mr. Fantastic.

4565
02:58:30,930 --> 02:58:31,890
I'm 5-1!

4566
02:58:32,390 --> 02:58:33,730
I'm 5-1 tonight!

4567
02:58:33,890 --> 02:58:34,630
Oh, he's 5-1?

4568
02:58:35,110 --> 02:58:36,170
Yes, I'm 5-1!

4569
02:58:36,210 --> 02:58:36,950
I don't lose!

4570
02:58:36,950 --> 02:58:42,730
I, as the Discord admin of this channel, allow him to play...

4571
02:58:42,730 --> 02:58:42,870
Yes!

4572
02:58:43,290 --> 02:58:43,410
Yes!

4573
02:58:44,010 --> 02:58:44,970
Don't you quote me!

4574
02:58:44,970 --> 02:58:47,870
If you have a problem with it, you're going to get banned from my Discord.

4575
02:58:47,870 --> 02:58:48,690
Who still needs invite?

4576
02:58:49,370 --> 02:58:50,190
Me, me, me, me.

4577
02:58:50,210 --> 02:58:50,690
Thank you!

4578
02:58:51,170 --> 02:58:51,750
Yeah, ban me!

4579
02:58:51,890 --> 02:58:52,550
Do it, then!

4580
02:58:53,170 --> 02:58:53,610
Invite...

4581
02:58:53,610 --> 02:58:54,530
He plays two Codys, Cody.

4582
02:58:54,530 --> 02:58:54,910
Do it!

4583
02:58:54,970 --> 02:58:56,070
Play 5v6!

4584
02:58:57,190 --> 02:58:57,510
Who?

4585
02:58:58,410 --> 02:58:59,190
Where are you, Scarra?

4586
02:58:59,310 --> 02:59:00,110
Can you request?

4587
02:59:01,430 --> 02:59:02,810
What's your name again?

4588
02:59:02,970 --> 02:59:03,890
Oh, hold on, I see it.

4589
02:59:04,490 --> 02:59:04,990
I requested.

4590
02:59:05,210 --> 02:59:05,710
Alright, nice.

4591
02:59:07,850 --> 02:59:09,350
Shit, I'll just play Mag, it's fine.

4592
02:59:10,050 --> 02:59:10,910
Is that your number one?

4593
02:59:11,010 --> 02:59:11,990
Like, you're happy on that?

4594
02:59:13,590 --> 02:59:13,910
Um...

4595
02:59:13,910 --> 02:59:15,490
Like, don't worry about what anybody else is playing.

4596
02:59:15,630 --> 02:59:16,950
What do you want to play, number one?

4597
02:59:18,330 --> 02:59:18,970
Mr. Fantastic.

4598
02:59:19,530 --> 02:59:20,750
I can actually play Mag.

4599
02:59:20,910 --> 02:59:21,790
I can play Mag.

4600
02:59:22,430 --> 02:59:28,710
Honestly, you might be Mag, because the scenario I had in my brain, which led to ggwellplayed, is me on Mag.

4601
02:59:28,950 --> 02:59:30,250
And I don't really like that, so...

4602
02:59:30,250 --> 02:59:31,930
No, no, I'm playing Mag, it's fine.

4603
02:59:32,310 --> 02:59:32,950
Are you sure?

4604
02:59:34,410 --> 02:59:35,570
Scarra, I'm down to swap, brother.

4605
02:59:35,670 --> 02:59:36,290
If you want to.

4606
02:59:36,290 --> 02:59:37,410
No, no, no.

4607
02:59:37,410 --> 02:59:39,670
I think you're him on Mr. Fantastic.

4608
02:59:39,670 --> 02:59:40,410
I'll just watch.

4609
02:59:40,690 --> 02:59:40,950
I sure am.

4610
02:59:41,090 --> 02:59:41,490
You're right about that.

4611
02:59:41,490 --> 02:59:42,050
I'll watch and take notes.

4612
02:59:42,630 --> 02:59:44,050
Yeah, I'll send you the replay later.

4613
02:59:44,270 --> 02:59:45,630
Okay, we have the best team.

4614
02:59:46,270 --> 02:59:49,090
Boger was, like, single handedly killing games on Strange.

4615
02:59:49,190 --> 02:59:53,950
When you have two Mr. Fantastic enjoyers on one team, that's crazy.

4616
02:59:54,330 --> 02:59:56,390
Two fantastic names, okay.

4617
02:59:56,830 --> 02:59:57,730
Boger was...

4618
02:59:57,730 --> 02:59:59,360
Wait, Boger was...

4619
03:00:01,910 --> 03:00:04,250
I played on Boger's team that game.

4620
03:00:04,430 --> 03:00:05,230
He was Hulk.

4621
03:00:05,230 --> 03:00:06,190
No, no, no.

4622
03:00:06,450 --> 03:00:06,670
Last game.

4623
03:00:06,770 --> 03:00:08,010
I was on his team last game.

4624
03:00:08,150 --> 03:00:11,950
But he literally, like, dipped xQc so hard on Strange.

4625
03:00:11,970 --> 03:00:13,290
He should have been on...

4626
03:00:13,290 --> 03:00:15,270
I think it's a little fucked because he just plays everything.

4627
03:00:15,890 --> 03:00:16,790
No, no, no.

4628
03:00:16,810 --> 03:00:19,290
His Hulk is not as good as a Strange, trust me.

4629
03:00:19,390 --> 03:00:19,530
Really?

4630
03:00:19,790 --> 03:00:20,490
I watched it.

4631
03:00:20,490 --> 03:00:22,590
He is literally a Strange one trick.

4632
03:00:23,210 --> 03:00:25,490
Not one trick, but, like, he's a Strange main.

4633
03:00:25,570 --> 03:00:28,190
I also do know Boger as, like, a Strange main.

4634
03:00:28,730 --> 03:00:31,410
Strange needs to be banned, like, because...

4635
03:00:31,410 --> 03:00:33,090
Yeah, I'm down to ban him.

4636
03:00:33,570 --> 03:00:38,090
So, like, the difference between, like, his Strange and whatever I play is gonna be really bad.

4637
03:00:38,290 --> 03:00:39,130
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

4638
03:00:39,150 --> 03:00:40,830
He, like, dipped xQc hard on Strange.

4639
03:00:40,910 --> 03:00:42,670
So, like, I'd rather just not deal with his Strange.

4640
03:00:45,760 --> 03:00:49,700
Yeah, if he's a Strange main, we know that his computer doesn't crash from Dr. Strange portals.

4641
03:00:51,080 --> 03:00:52,000
So, who's playing what?

4642
03:00:52,820 --> 03:00:55,200
I can flex whatever for support.

4643
03:00:57,180 --> 03:00:59,360
I also support main Unforged.

4644
03:00:59,640 --> 03:01:03,120
If you play against Necros, just save and pick Strange.

4645
03:01:03,360 --> 03:01:04,400
Oh, we have Sleepy as well.

4646
03:01:04,460 --> 03:01:06,560
Can I have an invite, please?

4647
03:01:07,460 --> 03:01:09,720
The lobby's full, but...

4648
03:01:09,720 --> 03:01:11,300
Someone has to be kicked, then, right?

4649
03:01:11,640 --> 03:01:12,340
Wait, what?

4650
03:01:12,820 --> 03:01:13,420
Who has to be kicked?

4651
03:01:13,580 --> 03:01:15,740
This Imaqtpie guy, is he playing?

4652
03:01:17,780 --> 03:01:18,220
Yeah.

4653
03:01:18,300 --> 03:01:19,360
Oh, he is.

4654
03:01:19,500 --> 03:01:21,260
Someone on our team has to be kicked.

4655
03:01:22,420 --> 03:01:23,900
Wait a second, let me think.

4656
03:01:23,900 --> 03:01:24,900
Oh, Selene, right?

4657
03:01:25,060 --> 03:01:25,500
Selene.

4658
03:01:25,720 --> 03:01:26,060
Uh-oh.

4659
03:01:27,780 --> 03:01:28,660
Who's Hampoon?

4660
03:01:29,360 --> 03:01:29,860
That's me.

4661
03:01:30,500 --> 03:01:30,780
Oh.

4662
03:01:31,940 --> 03:01:32,240
Hello.

4663
03:01:33,120 --> 03:01:33,520
Hello.

4664
03:01:35,860 --> 03:01:37,020
I'll just watch.

4665
03:01:40,280 --> 03:01:42,220
Oh my god, you got to Diamond, Coney?

4666
03:01:42,980 --> 03:01:44,100
You finally did it.

4667
03:01:44,140 --> 03:01:46,600
His name is Fake Doki, you know that.

4668
03:01:46,840 --> 03:01:48,800
I'm so proud of you.

4669
03:01:49,080 --> 03:01:49,920
Oh, Doki, you're Celestial?

4670
03:01:50,400 --> 03:01:50,820
Yeah.

4671
03:01:50,920 --> 03:01:52,960
I didn't play for two weeks, though, so...

4672
03:01:52,960 --> 03:01:56,420
I came back yesterday and went from Celestial 3 to Celestial 1.

4673
03:01:56,720 --> 03:01:58,080
Oh yeah, so you got a tummy ache.

4674
03:01:58,100 --> 03:01:59,220
So you're a god, right?

4675
03:01:59,440 --> 03:01:59,720
No.

4676
03:02:01,740 --> 03:02:03,300
I'm just a support player.

4677
03:02:05,040 --> 03:02:06,300
Did you get food poisoning?

4678
03:02:06,480 --> 03:02:07,560
Yeah, I got food poisoning in Japan.

4679
03:02:07,780 --> 03:02:08,340
I don't know how.

4680
03:02:08,980 --> 03:02:10,840
I literally was like the only person that got it.

4681
03:02:12,180 --> 03:02:13,560
I filled for us.

4682
03:02:13,700 --> 03:02:16,880
We won last game, but it was a pretty bad Punisher.

4683
03:02:18,420 --> 03:02:20,320
I played Punisher for us.

4684
03:02:20,820 --> 03:02:21,880
You did crazy.

4685
03:02:21,960 --> 03:02:22,620
You did great.

4686
03:02:22,780 --> 03:02:23,200
You went all in.

4687
03:02:23,260 --> 03:02:24,480
Yeah, you did your job.

4688
03:02:24,620 --> 03:02:27,080
I don't think I did great, but thank you.

4689
03:02:27,300 --> 03:02:27,920
But who won?

4690
03:02:27,920 --> 03:02:28,740
You did great, Hampoon.

4691
03:02:29,200 --> 03:02:29,700
Did you win?

4692
03:02:29,840 --> 03:02:31,140
We did win, we did win.

4693
03:02:31,220 --> 03:02:31,780
You won.

4694
03:02:31,780 --> 03:02:35,800
If push comes to shove, I can feel Punisher and Hella.

4695
03:02:36,060 --> 03:02:37,680
I can also flex the DPS.

4696
03:02:37,900 --> 03:02:39,780
My best DPS is Psylocke.

4697
03:02:41,100 --> 03:02:43,180
Oh, Doki, I wanted to thank you in person.

4698
03:02:43,280 --> 03:02:44,840
Oh yeah, congrats, SeanBamil.

4699
03:02:45,080 --> 03:02:45,720
We're almost at 1 mil.

4700
03:02:45,960 --> 03:02:46,560
I made you.

4701
03:02:48,300 --> 03:02:49,640
Thanks for the follow me.

4702
03:02:50,220 --> 03:02:51,280
That is crazy.

4703
03:02:51,620 --> 03:02:57,000
Yeah, he made a video on the Twitch Rivals shit, and then it got almost a million views in six days.

4704
03:02:57,340 --> 03:02:58,440
That is crazy.

4705
03:02:58,440 --> 03:03:02,760
My normal YouTube numbers are like 50,000, and this shit makes no sense.

4706
03:03:02,880 --> 03:03:04,780
Because this one's at a million, and nothing else is even close.

4707
03:03:04,780 --> 03:03:05,000
What do you mean?

4708
03:03:05,080 --> 03:03:05,800
It makes perfect sense.

4709
03:03:06,100 --> 03:03:07,180
Doki's face is on it.

4710
03:03:07,580 --> 03:03:12,260
You can use me as clickbait, and you can farm the drama.

4711
03:03:12,560 --> 03:03:13,760
Farm as much as you want.

4712
03:03:13,860 --> 03:03:16,240
On your next video without Doki, just put her face in it.

4713
03:03:16,460 --> 03:03:20,160
I'm going to make a video about this tournament and still find a way to flame xQc.

4714
03:03:21,480 --> 03:03:23,000
I'll make another video about this.

4715
03:03:23,100 --> 03:03:23,580
That'll be fun.

4716
03:03:24,780 --> 03:03:26,100
Wait, have you beat xQc yet?

4717
03:03:27,140 --> 03:03:28,740
We play next round, actually.

4718
03:03:28,780 --> 03:03:30,560
That's the one time we play.

4719
03:03:33,060 --> 03:03:33,500
Wait,

4720
03:03:37,340 --> 03:03:38,020
I'm banning?

4721
03:03:38,600 --> 03:03:39,300
Oh shit, okay.

4722
03:03:39,660 --> 03:03:40,240
I'm banning.

4723
03:03:41,460 --> 03:03:42,380
Okay, what are we protecting?

4724
03:03:44,060 --> 03:03:44,420
Loki.

4725
03:03:45,860 --> 03:03:47,900
Oh, they banned your Loki.

4726
03:03:49,040 --> 03:03:49,840
What are we protecting?

4727
03:03:50,700 --> 03:03:52,520
Honestly, because what else do we need to protect?

4728
03:03:52,520 --> 03:03:55,520
Oh, you want to protect Mr. Fantastic?

4729
03:03:59,080 --> 03:04:00,080
I'll save Luna.

4730
03:04:01,740 --> 03:04:03,540
You guys don't want to save Fantastic?

4731
03:04:03,700 --> 03:04:04,820
Bro, he's right here, man.

4732
03:04:07,100 --> 03:04:10,280
If I draw a ban at any point in this tournament, I won the tournament.

4733
03:04:10,420 --> 03:04:11,060
That's all I care about.

4734
03:04:11,060 --> 03:04:13,000
Okay, so who are we banning next?

4735
03:04:14,740 --> 03:04:15,900
That's his next video then.

4736
03:04:16,080 --> 03:04:17,860
They were scared of my Mr. Fantastic.

4737
03:04:18,320 --> 03:04:20,380
Let me look at the characters.

4738
03:04:20,380 --> 03:04:21,900
Maybe Hulk?

4739
03:04:22,480 --> 03:04:23,180
I'm down for Hulk.

4740
03:04:23,240 --> 03:04:23,940
Okay, ban Hulk.

4741
03:04:24,100 --> 03:04:24,700
I'll ban Hulk.

4742
03:04:25,020 --> 03:04:26,120
Wait, he said Groot.

4743
03:04:26,420 --> 03:04:28,700
What does Taric play if not Groot?

4744
03:04:28,800 --> 03:04:30,920
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

4745
03:04:31,200 --> 03:04:32,100
Should we not ban...

4746
03:04:33,280 --> 03:04:34,480
Groot's not even that scary.

4747
03:04:34,960 --> 03:04:35,940
Should we not ban Rocket?

4748
03:04:36,480 --> 03:04:37,480
They saved Punisher.

4749
03:04:37,600 --> 03:04:38,220
Oh, that's true.

4750
03:04:38,840 --> 03:04:40,120
Yeah, let's just ban Rocket.

4751
03:04:41,660 --> 03:04:42,920
They just don't have...

4752
03:04:43,840 --> 03:04:44,880
I'll just ban Rocket.

4753
03:04:47,200 --> 03:04:47,920
That's right.

4754
03:04:49,100 --> 03:04:49,580
Yeah!

4755
03:04:52,280 --> 03:04:52,940
Let's go!

4756
03:04:53,740 --> 03:04:54,980
Alright, I'll play whatever.

4757
03:04:57,880 --> 03:04:59,460
He's gonna play... I'll freeze.

4758
03:05:00,320 --> 03:05:02,640
I'll just try and freeze the Hulk as much as I can.

4759
03:05:03,660 --> 03:05:03,900
Alright.

4760
03:05:08,380 --> 03:05:10,000
I hate support players.

4761
03:05:10,540 --> 03:05:11,320
I hate you too.

4762
03:05:15,140 --> 03:05:16,660
Wait, Connie, what skin are you using?

4763
03:05:17,680 --> 03:05:19,420
The one skin he has, bro.

4764
03:05:19,500 --> 03:05:20,940
You know I gotta go Maker.

4765
03:05:21,080 --> 03:05:22,400
Oh, shit.

4766
03:05:24,080 --> 03:05:26,940
I've never seen the MVP screen for that skin I bought.

4767
03:05:27,260 --> 03:05:28,740
You probably won't today.

4768
03:05:30,440 --> 03:05:34,440
I don't know if you can see it, but we'll give it a shot.

4769
03:05:36,020 --> 03:05:37,380
Wait, so we're triple DPSing this?

4770
03:05:38,040 --> 03:05:38,660
Yeah, that's fine.

4771
03:05:39,000 --> 03:05:41,760
I mean, if it doesn't work, we're just one trip support.

4772
03:05:42,260 --> 03:05:44,140
Yeah, is Connie really a DPS?

4773
03:05:44,460 --> 03:05:45,480
Not really, no.

4774
03:05:47,380 --> 03:05:48,980
I'll put the...

4775
03:05:48,980 --> 03:05:50,360
Oh, wait, we have Starlord.

4776
03:05:50,460 --> 03:05:52,140
Okay, I'll put the orb on the Starlord then.

4777
03:05:53,220 --> 03:05:53,760
Thank you.

4778
03:05:56,960 --> 03:05:58,220
Who the fuck is whistling?

4779
03:06:00,120 --> 03:06:01,540
Hey, stop whistling.

4780
03:06:02,420 --> 03:06:03,360
Stop whistling!

4781
03:06:07,040 --> 03:06:08,040
I like the whistling.

4782
03:06:09,600 --> 03:06:10,740
It's good for morale.

4783
03:06:18,340 --> 03:06:19,680
They have Moon Knight Groot.

4784
03:06:19,800 --> 03:06:20,840
They just can do that over and over.

4785
03:06:21,100 --> 03:06:21,940
Oh, they do.

4786
03:06:22,360 --> 03:06:24,360
Yeah, that's why I was down to ban the Groot.

4787
03:06:26,540 --> 03:06:28,080
Oh, you guys have their walls.

4788
03:06:28,620 --> 03:06:30,180
Oh, got walled and anked here.

4789
03:06:32,220 --> 03:06:35,020
I was fine with the wall, but the anked there messed me up.

4790
03:06:36,960 --> 03:06:38,060
I might need...

4791
03:06:39,200 --> 03:06:39,640
Thank you.

4792
03:06:40,020 --> 03:06:40,720
I'm going to try to get a kill.

4793
03:06:42,780 --> 03:06:43,460
No.

4794
03:06:47,480 --> 03:06:48,660
Oh my god.

4795
03:06:48,780 --> 03:06:51,100
He died when I was expecting it.

4796
03:06:51,620 --> 03:06:53,120
I'm sorry, what do I do?

4797
03:06:56,580 --> 03:07:00,620
We ban Strange.

4798
03:07:00,860 --> 03:07:04,340
Wait, I might be dead.

4799
03:07:04,840 --> 03:07:05,600
I might be stacked.

4800
03:07:05,600 --> 03:07:07,660
I was like, wait, we ban him.

4801
03:07:09,740 --> 03:07:12,520
I think you have to play with us because we're getting built by Thor.

4802
03:07:13,320 --> 03:07:15,520
Yeah, I missed my freeze.

4803
03:07:15,720 --> 03:07:16,720
I can play back too.

4804
03:07:16,860 --> 03:07:18,040
I wasn't expecting it.

4805
03:07:18,540 --> 03:07:19,300
Can we touch this?

4806
03:07:19,380 --> 03:07:20,060
I don't think we can.

4807
03:07:20,440 --> 03:07:21,000
No way.

4808
03:07:21,060 --> 03:07:24,080
We can touch this.

4809
03:07:29,540 --> 03:07:31,060
I put a thing there.

4810
03:07:36,180 --> 03:07:37,440
I got you, I got you.

4811
03:07:39,320 --> 03:07:40,300
Oh my god.

4812
03:07:43,300 --> 03:07:44,760
I'm fucking up my freezes.

4813
03:07:45,940 --> 03:07:47,120
Holy shit, man.

4814
03:07:49,060 --> 03:07:50,480
I'm just getting deleted immediately.

4815
03:07:50,800 --> 03:07:54,100
Can somebody in the LA area go to Jon's house and punch him in the fucking head?

4816
03:07:57,880 --> 03:07:58,500
I have my ult.

4817
03:08:00,280 --> 03:08:02,840
We should maybe close the ult in.

4818
03:08:03,740 --> 03:08:04,480
Yeah, I can.

4819
03:08:07,300 --> 03:08:08,720
Since they already used Brutal.

4820
03:08:08,900 --> 03:08:10,360
They haven't used Moon Knight ult, by the way.

4821
03:08:14,900 --> 03:08:15,640
Nice, nice.

4822
03:08:17,920 --> 03:08:20,060
I'm going to die to this.

4823
03:08:21,160 --> 03:08:22,140
He's one, he's one.

4824
03:08:22,920 --> 03:08:24,480
I didn't want him to force ult off me.

4825
03:08:26,880 --> 03:08:27,620
Behind you, Wes.

4826
03:08:28,080 --> 03:08:28,440
He's one.

4827
03:08:29,800 --> 03:08:30,780
I'm coming, I'm coming.

4828
03:08:30,780 --> 03:08:32,300
Can we get back?

4829
03:08:33,180 --> 03:08:33,660
Oh, are we down?

4830
03:08:35,080 --> 03:08:36,380
No, it's fine, it's fine.

4831
03:08:37,820 --> 03:08:39,100
I'm just trying to get some time here.

4832
03:08:39,760 --> 03:08:40,000
Here.

4833
03:08:41,980 --> 03:08:42,380
Okay.

4834
03:08:43,320 --> 03:08:43,880
Got it.

4835
03:08:49,500 --> 03:08:51,000
Three, two, one.

4836
03:08:51,120 --> 03:08:52,320
I might be dead after my ult.

4837
03:08:53,040 --> 03:08:53,620
I'm okay, I am.

4838
03:08:54,800 --> 03:08:55,540
Moon Knight here.

4839
03:08:55,720 --> 03:08:56,620
I froze him, I froze him.

4840
03:08:56,620 --> 03:08:57,940
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4841
03:08:58,060 --> 03:08:59,100
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

4842
03:08:59,760 --> 03:09:01,560
They have Brutal here, they have Brutal.

4843
03:09:04,200 --> 03:09:05,760
Nice, nice, push up, push up.

4844
03:09:06,100 --> 03:09:07,400
I got all supports down.

4845
03:09:07,980 --> 03:09:08,440
I'm dead, I'm dead.

4846
03:09:08,560 --> 03:09:10,960
I got...

4847
03:09:11,500 --> 03:09:13,100
No supports, no supports.

4848
03:09:16,160 --> 03:09:17,440
Yeah, we're good.

4849
03:09:18,120 --> 03:09:19,820
They have Moon Knight ult here.

4850
03:09:20,520 --> 03:09:21,480
I'm coming back now.

4851
03:09:21,480 --> 03:09:22,520
Die, you fat fuck.

4852
03:09:23,820 --> 03:09:24,260
There we go.

4853
03:09:24,940 --> 03:09:26,760
They have Moon Knight, they just grew at the end.

4854
03:09:28,540 --> 03:09:29,720
Nah, they're close.

4855
03:09:31,740 --> 03:09:35,580
I need to put the orb on...

4856
03:09:35,580 --> 03:09:36,820
I need to put the orb on...

4857
03:09:36,820 --> 03:09:38,140
I'll make that more immuno, honestly.

4858
03:09:38,300 --> 03:09:38,440
I'll make that more immuno, honestly.

4859
03:09:38,440 --> 03:09:40,600
I think I was worried.

4860
03:09:45,040 --> 03:09:46,800
I'm just trying to trust my backline.

4861
03:09:49,300 --> 03:09:50,660
I can't get to you, Kurt, I can't.

4862
03:09:50,680 --> 03:09:51,080
Can you heal me?

4863
03:09:51,120 --> 03:09:52,060
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

4864
03:09:57,880 --> 03:09:58,200
Nice.

4865
03:10:00,540 --> 03:10:02,400
There's a Groot to our left, Groot to our left.

4866
03:10:02,820 --> 03:10:03,780
Groot by himself.

4867
03:10:04,860 --> 03:10:06,060
Nice, nice, nice.

4868
03:10:07,000 --> 03:10:07,900
Groot is still here.

4869
03:10:08,740 --> 03:10:10,120
He's trying to farm ult, he's farming ult.

4870
03:10:10,660 --> 03:10:11,180
He's dead, he's dead.

4871
03:10:12,600 --> 03:10:13,440
I have my ult, I have my ult.

4872
03:10:15,200 --> 03:10:16,580
He's gonna have Groot ult again soon.

4873
03:10:17,400 --> 03:10:17,420
Okay.

4874
03:10:21,320 --> 03:10:22,560
You're good, you're good, you're good.

4875
03:10:23,440 --> 03:10:24,040
Good hold.

4876
03:10:24,880 --> 03:10:25,600
You're good, you're good.

4877
03:10:26,080 --> 03:10:27,340
They're gonna have Moon Knight ult already.

4878
03:10:28,040 --> 03:10:29,360
Just watch Groot, Moon Knight ult.

4879
03:10:29,360 --> 03:10:31,620
They're gonna have Thor as well.

4880
03:10:32,200 --> 03:10:33,220
No, they used Thor, they used Thor.

4881
03:10:33,340 --> 03:10:34,640
They tried to solo ult, they're close.

4882
03:10:37,020 --> 03:10:37,600
He's up here.

4883
03:10:38,860 --> 03:10:39,840
I'm trying to get him.

4884
03:10:39,920 --> 03:10:40,560
I got you, I got you.

4885
03:10:42,320 --> 03:10:43,180
I'm going, I'm going.

4886
03:10:45,260 --> 03:10:46,160
Shit, I'm on a wall.

4887
03:10:46,160 --> 03:10:49,180
I got you, I got you, I got you.

4888
03:10:51,780 --> 03:10:53,720
Yeah, yeah, I'm waiting, I'm waiting, I'm waiting.

4889
03:10:53,860 --> 03:10:54,620
We don't have to match yet.

4890
03:10:58,540 --> 03:10:59,700
I'm on Namor, he's one.

4891
03:10:59,980 --> 03:11:00,300
Okay, okay.

4892
03:11:01,540 --> 03:11:03,540
He's gonna ult us, he wants to ult us, he wants to ult us.

4893
03:11:04,200 --> 03:11:04,980
I know, I know, I know.

4894
03:11:05,180 --> 03:11:06,460
They pushed up, they pushed up a bit.

4895
03:11:07,760 --> 03:11:08,660
Careful for Groot, careful for Groot.

4896
03:11:09,500 --> 03:11:10,780
Don't take stack, don't take stack.

4897
03:11:13,120 --> 03:11:14,260
Oh, yeah, I can't.

4898
03:11:14,480 --> 03:11:15,840
You guys are not living that.

4899
03:11:19,380 --> 03:11:20,800
I'm dead here.

4900
03:11:29,030 --> 03:11:32,030
Oh, they got their ult combo.

4901
03:11:33,050 --> 03:11:34,210
That was gonna happen.

4902
03:11:35,790 --> 03:11:36,390
Wait,

4903
03:11:40,530 --> 03:11:41,970
do we have... yeah, we could...

4904
03:11:41,970 --> 03:11:43,770
We'll... there's Groot.

4905
03:11:46,650 --> 03:11:47,250
I'm over here now.

4906
03:11:47,730 --> 03:11:48,190
Thor, Thor.

4907
03:11:51,810 --> 03:11:53,490
You're behind, you're behind, you're walled off.

4908
03:11:53,590 --> 03:11:54,430
Yeah, yeah.

4909
03:12:01,840 --> 03:12:03,300
We gotta group up.

4910
03:12:14,200 --> 03:12:14,560
Yeah.

4911
03:12:18,940 --> 03:12:19,880
I got you, I got you.

4912
03:12:20,560 --> 03:12:21,740
I froze him, I froze him.

4913
03:12:23,580 --> 03:12:25,060
I have my ult in a sec, 90.

4914
03:12:28,220 --> 03:12:29,800
Yeah, yeah, I can try it.

4915
03:12:30,360 --> 03:12:30,480
I'm going.

4916
03:12:32,760 --> 03:12:33,560
I need to reload.

4917
03:12:36,180 --> 03:12:36,820
I'm walled.

4918
03:12:37,940 --> 03:12:40,100
I have like a squid on me and I can't heal.

4919
03:12:41,220 --> 03:12:42,120
Yeah, I'm coming to you.

4920
03:12:42,420 --> 03:12:42,740
Thank you.

4921
03:12:44,040 --> 03:12:45,680
They're gonna have Groot ult combo again.

4922
03:12:45,820 --> 03:12:46,280
They have Groot.

4923
03:12:47,180 --> 03:12:48,840
Nice, nice, got it.

4924
03:12:50,000 --> 03:12:50,820
Alright, they got a minute.

4925
03:12:51,240 --> 03:12:51,600
We can ult.

4926
03:12:53,080 --> 03:12:53,900
They're gonna combo.

4927
03:12:53,900 --> 03:12:55,280
They have combo, they have combo.

4928
03:12:55,840 --> 03:12:58,040
Hold up because I wanna get the combo out early if we can.

4929
03:12:58,860 --> 03:13:00,560
Stay split, stay split with the backline.

4930
03:13:01,880 --> 03:13:03,000
And then yeah, can you just look at Thor?

4931
03:13:03,440 --> 03:13:04,780
You can just double trap him.

4932
03:13:05,240 --> 03:13:05,340
Yeah.

4933
03:13:10,680 --> 03:13:12,200
Kill him, kill him, kill him.

4934
03:13:12,680 --> 03:13:14,420
Oh, you pulled him away from me.

4935
03:13:15,340 --> 03:13:16,320
You're walled out, Camille.

4936
03:13:18,200 --> 03:13:19,840
They're looking for it, they're looking for it.

4937
03:13:19,920 --> 03:13:20,520
Stay split, stay split.

4938
03:13:22,540 --> 03:13:24,200
I froze Thor, I froze Thor to my right, left.

4939
03:13:26,200 --> 03:13:27,760
I'm ulting this, I'm ulting this, I'm ulting this.

4940
03:13:30,200 --> 03:13:30,960
I'm on me.

4941
03:13:31,480 --> 03:13:32,860
It's fine, I've saved the front.

4942
03:13:34,980 --> 03:13:35,620
Moonlight's low.

4943
03:13:35,660 --> 03:13:38,700
3, 2, 1, I'm backing out, I'm backing out, I'm backing out.

4944
03:13:40,360 --> 03:13:42,000
I froze Groot, I froze Groot.

4945
03:13:44,860 --> 03:13:45,520
I'm trying to steal.

4946
03:13:45,680 --> 03:13:47,400
I got you, I got you, I got you, I got you.

4947
03:13:49,540 --> 03:13:50,600
Thor left, Thor left.

4948
03:13:50,780 --> 03:13:51,560
Low, low, low, low, low.

4949
03:13:53,420 --> 03:13:55,380
I got you, I got you, I got you.

4950
03:13:55,940 --> 03:13:57,080
I'm ulting Thor, I'm ulting Thor, I'm ulting Thor.

4951
03:13:57,140 --> 03:13:57,780
Thor, Thor, Thor.

4952
03:13:58,200 --> 03:13:58,800
Yes, Thor down.

4953
03:14:02,000 --> 03:14:02,640
I'm piting it.

4954
03:14:05,340 --> 03:14:05,580
Reloading.

4955
03:14:05,760 --> 03:14:07,300
You're walled out, walled out, I got you, I got you.

4956
03:14:07,460 --> 03:14:09,560
I got it, I got it, I'm back.

4957
03:14:12,540 --> 03:14:13,180
Fuck me.

4958
03:14:15,480 --> 03:14:16,820
I see you, I see you, I see you.

4959
03:14:17,740 --> 03:14:18,440
I got you, I got you.

4960
03:14:20,480 --> 03:14:21,920
Push up, push up, push up, push up.

4961
03:14:22,480 --> 03:14:23,300
Oh, I might be dead.

4962
03:14:26,260 --> 03:14:27,600
Thor, Thor, Thor, Thor is on me.

4963
03:14:27,620 --> 03:14:28,340
I'm on him, I'm on him, I'm on him.

4964
03:14:29,020 --> 03:14:30,500
I got somebody before I died.

4965
03:14:32,000 --> 03:14:33,460
No, no, no, behind Thor.

4966
03:14:33,700 --> 03:14:34,460
I have all innate.

4967
03:14:35,740 --> 03:14:36,140
I'm just going.

4968
03:14:39,080 --> 03:14:39,600
It's Thor.

4969
03:14:42,140 --> 03:14:42,960
I'm coming back.

4970
03:14:44,820 --> 03:14:45,340
I'm coming back.

4971
03:14:45,340 --> 03:14:46,240
I'm on my way back, I'm on my way back.

4972
03:14:47,400 --> 03:14:48,120
Oh shit.

4973
03:14:48,820 --> 03:14:50,520
Tris, tris, tris, tris, tris, tris, tris, tris.

4974
03:14:55,260 --> 03:14:56,340
Honestly, fine hold.

4975
03:14:56,640 --> 03:14:57,740
I mean, we went 99, 99.

4976
03:14:58,120 --> 03:14:58,480
Yeah.

4977
03:14:59,560 --> 03:14:59,920
Winnable.

4978
03:15:00,980 --> 03:15:04,140
If they're on Thor again, yeah, just keep putting our skruggle on them, I think.

4979
03:15:04,780 --> 03:15:05,860
Just CC them down if you can.

4980
03:15:05,860 --> 03:15:07,860
You'll need a top notch team to win this one.

4981
03:15:07,860 --> 03:15:09,280
I can still hold the team.

4982
03:15:09,800 --> 03:15:12,060
That was just, that was unfortunate, Kone.

4983
03:15:12,260 --> 03:15:13,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I could've touched.

4984
03:15:13,720 --> 03:15:15,640
I didn't notice that she wasn't right.

4985
03:15:16,060 --> 03:15:17,860
Before that, you saved John.

4986
03:15:19,640 --> 03:15:21,640
I was trying to pull him into our team.

4987
03:15:21,780 --> 03:15:22,120
I didn't realize.

4988
03:15:22,120 --> 03:15:27,040
I had him double nutted and I'm like point blank just shotgunning him with my fucking nuts.

4989
03:15:27,220 --> 03:15:28,920
And Kone pulls him out of the corridor.

4990
03:15:29,520 --> 03:15:32,200
I tried to pull him into the team, I thought we had him.

4991
03:15:32,200 --> 03:15:33,880
No, that was just, that was unlucky, that was unlucky.

4992
03:15:34,180 --> 03:15:34,360
That's tough.

4993
03:15:34,980 --> 03:15:36,020
We got this though.

4994
03:15:36,120 --> 03:15:38,320
Because we got, we held them all the way to the end.

4995
03:15:39,180 --> 03:15:40,200
They got zero seconds.

4996
03:15:40,200 --> 03:15:40,880
Yeah, yeah, we got this, we got this.

4997
03:15:43,400 --> 03:15:44,700
Just do it again.

4998
03:15:45,460 --> 03:15:47,180
Just do it again.

4999
03:15:51,100 --> 03:15:54,280
I don't know if I should do the Namor team up or if I should do Storm.

5000
03:15:55,520 --> 03:15:57,200
Wait, I could say Storm goes hard.

5001
03:15:57,940 --> 03:15:58,500
What does?

5002
03:15:58,960 --> 03:15:59,360
Storm?

5003
03:15:59,580 --> 03:16:01,100
I think Storm would go hard.

5004
03:16:01,360 --> 03:16:01,700
Really?

5005
03:16:01,820 --> 03:16:03,300
I feel like Namor is doing a lot.

5006
03:16:04,720 --> 03:16:06,000
Yeah, I think they're both good.

5007
03:16:07,880 --> 03:16:09,020
We're pushing though, right?

5008
03:16:09,500 --> 03:16:09,860
Yeah.

5009
03:16:12,500 --> 03:16:14,140
Whatever you want, you know better than me.

5010
03:16:14,500 --> 03:16:15,380
You know better than me.

5011
03:16:18,640 --> 03:16:25,640
I feel like I have to put my orb on Mag just because...

5012
03:16:25,640 --> 03:16:26,320
Yeah, the walls.

5013
03:16:27,480 --> 03:16:28,600
Oh my gosh.

5014
03:16:39,190 --> 03:16:40,770
I froze somebody, I don't know who.

5015
03:16:42,710 --> 03:16:44,330
I can heal you, yeah.

5016
03:16:46,490 --> 03:16:46,990
Oh!

5017
03:16:47,970 --> 03:16:49,230
I'm walking up, I'm walking up.

5018
03:16:49,910 --> 03:16:50,390
Careful on the right.

5019
03:16:50,890 --> 03:16:51,490
I'm reloading.

5020
03:16:58,210 --> 03:16:58,890
Reloading here.

5021
03:17:00,330 --> 03:17:01,270
I froze him.

5022
03:17:04,790 --> 03:17:06,370
Yeah, I'm swapping to Starlord.

5023
03:17:11,150 --> 03:17:11,790
I'm healing.

5024
03:17:12,910 --> 03:17:14,130
I got you, I got you, I got you.

5025
03:17:16,490 --> 03:17:17,790
You're just walling the supports.

5026
03:17:18,050 --> 03:17:19,050
Walls are not okay.

5027
03:17:19,350 --> 03:17:21,450
Yeah, we need someone to shoot the walls too.

5028
03:17:22,750 --> 03:17:24,030
I don't know, I can't really play the game.

5029
03:17:24,030 --> 03:17:24,570
I'm gonna do the Storm.

5030
03:17:24,810 --> 03:17:26,010
I can't play the game.

5031
03:17:27,030 --> 03:17:30,610
Lunite down, Lunite down.

5032
03:17:30,630 --> 03:17:32,770
I literally have all of their fucking supports on me.

5033
03:17:33,310 --> 03:17:34,390
Thor has ult, Thor has ult.

5034
03:17:34,910 --> 03:17:36,050
And so does Groot.

5035
03:17:36,310 --> 03:17:37,870
I missed mine, I need to use this.

5036
03:17:38,030 --> 03:17:38,550
I'm using it.

5037
03:17:38,950 --> 03:17:41,070
We just use this to push up.

5038
03:17:41,750 --> 03:17:42,550
No more bubble down.

5039
03:17:44,190 --> 03:17:44,970
I'm using the push up.

5040
03:17:46,750 --> 03:17:47,570
I'm backing up.

5041
03:17:47,830 --> 03:17:49,290
Get to the wall, get to the wall, get to the wall.

5042
03:17:50,710 --> 03:17:52,170
I froze the Groot, I froze the Groot.

5043
03:17:52,290 --> 03:17:53,250
He has ult, he has ult.

5044
03:17:54,070 --> 03:17:54,770
He's looking for it.

5045
03:17:55,710 --> 03:17:56,930
He still ulted me, he still ulted me.

5046
03:17:59,870 --> 03:18:02,270
I still have the tank on me.

5047
03:18:02,770 --> 03:18:03,930
I don't know if I can kill this.

5048
03:18:20,900 --> 03:18:22,500
He's half, he's low.

5049
03:18:30,380 --> 03:18:31,500
Can we kill Thor?

5050
03:18:33,660 --> 03:18:35,380
He's half, he's half, he's solo, he's solo.

5051
03:18:35,460 --> 03:18:36,220
Just one hit, one hit.

5052
03:18:36,760 --> 03:18:37,080
I got him.

5053
03:18:38,520 --> 03:18:39,300
I got you.

5054
03:18:40,400 --> 03:18:41,620
Walking up, walking up.

5055
03:18:47,340 --> 03:18:48,720
I'm walking in, I'm walking in, I'm walking in.

5056
03:18:49,620 --> 03:18:50,960
I'm on the cart, I'm on the cart.

5057
03:18:51,540 --> 03:18:52,600
No more, no more, no more.

5058
03:18:56,120 --> 03:18:56,980
Can I get a heal?

5059
03:18:58,160 --> 03:18:58,700
Got you.

5060
03:18:59,900 --> 03:19:00,380
On us.

5061
03:19:01,980 --> 03:19:02,760
What the hell is this?

5062
03:19:07,760 --> 03:19:08,820
Walk up B, walk up B.

5063
03:19:09,480 --> 03:19:10,600
Okay, I'm playing aggro.

5064
03:19:11,320 --> 03:19:12,300
I'm gonna walk up a little.

5065
03:19:13,500 --> 03:19:14,600
You can, you can, you can.

5066
03:19:14,620 --> 03:19:16,020
Yeah, I'm walking up, I'm walking up.

5067
03:19:16,060 --> 03:19:16,780
I should stay, right?

5068
03:19:16,960 --> 03:19:17,720
Am I supposed to go up?

5069
03:19:18,000 --> 03:19:19,540
No, no, no, no, stay on cart for now.

5070
03:19:23,480 --> 03:19:25,940
I just want my ult first because mine's closest.

5071
03:19:26,860 --> 03:19:27,040
Yeah.

5072
03:19:29,080 --> 03:19:30,060
They subbed Groot ult.

5073
03:19:30,100 --> 03:19:30,900
They're gonna have Groot ult here.

5074
03:19:36,220 --> 03:19:37,400
I'm coming, I'm coming.

5075
03:19:39,860 --> 03:19:40,340
Pulling back.

5076
03:19:40,480 --> 03:19:41,560
Go with it first, go with it first.

5077
03:19:42,180 --> 03:19:43,320
Push, push, push, push.

5078
03:19:43,400 --> 03:19:45,020
Yeah, help him if you can, help him if you can.

5079
03:19:46,940 --> 03:19:48,500
We don't need to use anything, we don't need to use anything.

5080
03:19:48,600 --> 03:19:49,240
We win this, we win this.

5081
03:19:51,760 --> 03:19:52,600
Good job, good job.

5082
03:19:56,680 --> 03:19:58,180
We're pushing cart, supports are pushing cart.

5083
03:19:58,480 --> 03:19:59,440
We need one more, we need one more.

5084
03:20:01,200 --> 03:20:04,200
Yeah, you're by yourself by the way.

5085
03:20:04,200 --> 03:20:05,960
I don't have an orb.

5086
03:20:06,340 --> 03:20:07,240
He is free.

5087
03:20:09,040 --> 03:20:10,160
Fuck you, John!

5088
03:20:13,340 --> 03:20:15,420
You want me to ult?

5089
03:20:15,740 --> 03:20:16,120
Should I ult?

5090
03:20:19,200 --> 03:20:21,600
Mag, mag.

5091
03:20:21,780 --> 03:20:23,740
I got you, I got you, I got you.

5092
03:20:23,940 --> 03:20:25,540
Thank you.

5093
03:20:26,260 --> 03:20:28,180
I'm on mag, mag, mag, mag, mag, mag, mag.

5094
03:20:30,120 --> 03:20:31,380
Nice, nice, nice, mag, mag, mag.

5095
03:20:31,400 --> 03:20:32,260
Focus mag, focus mag.

5096
03:20:32,260 --> 03:20:34,220
He's one, he's one.

5097
03:20:34,320 --> 03:20:34,620
I got him.

5098
03:20:36,540 --> 03:20:39,020
We have four minutes.

5099
03:20:44,160 --> 03:20:44,720
I'm pushing.

5100
03:20:45,260 --> 03:20:47,360
You can push up, I have ult, I have ult.

5101
03:20:47,960 --> 03:20:49,760
We can win this fight with just my ults, okay?

5102
03:20:49,780 --> 03:20:50,220
Nothing else.

5103
03:20:52,180 --> 03:20:53,420
I'm gonna go in, you guys need to push.

5104
03:20:56,200 --> 03:20:57,240
Yeah, I'm not close yet.

5105
03:21:02,260 --> 03:21:03,440
Let's stall the fight out as long as we can.

5106
03:21:03,900 --> 03:21:04,660
Until they make a fight.

5107
03:21:05,540 --> 03:21:06,080
I'm pulling mag.

5108
03:21:08,720 --> 03:21:09,540
Guys, no shield.

5109
03:21:10,460 --> 03:21:10,980
Give me shield.

5110
03:21:12,000 --> 03:21:12,640
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

5111
03:21:17,180 --> 03:21:18,020
I bubbled us.

5112
03:21:19,800 --> 03:21:21,320
Oh no, I thought I could get to you.

5113
03:21:22,180 --> 03:21:23,200
I'm just gonna force the fight here.

5114
03:21:26,060 --> 03:21:28,800
No, you didn't.

5115
03:21:28,880 --> 03:21:30,000
We got mag ult out though.

5116
03:21:30,000 --> 03:21:31,600
That's fine, we got mag ult.

5117
03:21:34,460 --> 03:21:37,940
I think it's a good trade.

5118
03:21:39,580 --> 03:21:41,500
If she jumps, it breaks.

5119
03:21:43,080 --> 03:21:44,280
Any action.

5120
03:21:44,680 --> 03:21:45,340
Any action.

5121
03:21:46,160 --> 03:21:47,840
I poked on the impact.

5122
03:21:48,580 --> 03:21:49,740
Oh, that's unlucky.

5123
03:21:52,420 --> 03:21:53,920
I got you, I got you, I got you.

5124
03:21:54,880 --> 03:21:56,620
I have ult still.

5125
03:21:56,620 --> 03:21:58,780
Start the fight, use your ult mid fight, Abe.

5126
03:21:59,340 --> 03:21:59,940
I have 885.

5127
03:22:00,700 --> 03:22:01,800
I'm 888 on my ult.

5128
03:22:02,420 --> 03:22:03,260
I'm with you, Cody, I'm with you.

5129
03:22:08,900 --> 03:22:09,900
Do you support ulti?

5130
03:22:10,260 --> 03:22:10,940
I'm ulting, yeah.

5131
03:22:12,360 --> 03:22:13,400
Oh, sorry, no?

5132
03:22:14,100 --> 03:22:16,360
No, no, no, there was support behind us.

5133
03:22:16,680 --> 03:22:17,480
Hello ulti, hello ulti.

5134
03:22:24,470 --> 03:22:25,710
I have athor on me.

5135
03:22:25,810 --> 03:22:26,430
He got bubbled.

5136
03:22:29,910 --> 03:22:30,310
Maybe just wait.

5137
03:22:31,310 --> 03:22:33,410
There's a thor in spawn, I think.

5138
03:22:34,030 --> 03:22:34,930
Do that, do that, do that.

5139
03:22:35,410 --> 03:22:35,950
I need heal.

5140
03:22:42,130 --> 03:22:43,850
That's all their support ults.

5141
03:22:46,270 --> 03:22:48,010
Let's try to play aggro here.

5142
03:22:48,870 --> 03:22:50,410
At the end of support ults.

5143
03:22:50,490 --> 03:22:50,850
Playing up.

5144
03:22:51,530 --> 03:22:52,110
Pulling Thor.

5145
03:22:53,810 --> 03:22:54,830
I missed my froze.

5146
03:22:55,970 --> 03:22:57,350
Hitting Hela, Hela low.

5147
03:22:57,350 --> 03:22:59,270
They're all low, they're all so low.

5148
03:23:00,570 --> 03:23:01,390
Nice, nice, nice.

5149
03:23:02,170 --> 03:23:03,810
Mag, Mag, focus Mag, focus Mag.

5150
03:23:03,910 --> 03:23:04,870
Kill Hela, kill Hela.

5151
03:23:05,030 --> 03:23:05,610
Oh, nice, nice.

5152
03:23:06,990 --> 03:23:07,870
I got you, I got you, Cody.

5153
03:23:09,410 --> 03:23:10,550
We're even, we're even, we're even.

5154
03:23:22,530 --> 03:23:23,790
Mag, Mag, one Mag, one.

5155
03:23:24,230 --> 03:23:24,530
Got her.

5156
03:23:24,530 --> 03:23:24,950
Nice.

5157
03:23:26,510 --> 03:23:28,350
I'm solo, I'm solo, I can't.

5158
03:23:29,050 --> 03:23:31,190
I froze Thor, but like, he's behind us.

5159
03:23:31,370 --> 03:23:32,550
I'm pushing him away, I'm pushing him away.

5160
03:23:32,850 --> 03:23:33,950
That's two, that's two dead.

5161
03:23:34,730 --> 03:23:35,750
I'm gonna die.

5162
03:23:36,970 --> 03:23:37,770
I'm back up.

5163
03:23:38,930 --> 03:23:41,530
Yeah, Thor is delaying a cart push.

5164
03:23:42,570 --> 03:23:43,770
Cart push, please.

5165
03:23:47,030 --> 03:23:49,310
This is last fight, this is last fight.

5166
03:23:50,430 --> 03:23:51,710
I'm killing, I'm killing, I'm killing.

5167
03:23:54,770 --> 03:23:55,590
All right, heal.

5168
03:23:56,490 --> 03:23:58,130
I'm out, I'm gonna...

5169
03:23:58,130 --> 03:23:59,830
We can use, we can use, we can use.

5170
03:24:00,650 --> 03:24:02,470
I need to get...

5171
03:24:02,470 --> 03:24:03,230
Thor, Thor.

5172
03:24:06,930 --> 03:24:08,230
Thor is one, Thor is one.

5173
03:24:08,410 --> 03:24:08,970
Thor, I'm on Thor.

5174
03:24:09,170 --> 03:24:09,790
Nice, nice, nice.

5175
03:24:12,050 --> 03:24:13,030
They swirled through?

5176
03:24:13,470 --> 03:24:14,110
Yeah, they did.

5177
03:24:17,090 --> 03:24:17,850
They reload.

5178
03:24:18,750 --> 03:24:19,850
They're gonna have ult soon.

5179
03:24:22,570 --> 03:24:23,770
I got you, I got you.

5180
03:24:23,850 --> 03:24:25,250
They reloaded, they reloaded.

5181
03:24:29,530 --> 03:24:30,590
My bubble is up.

5182
03:24:31,990 --> 03:24:32,950
Oh, I'm 91.

5183
03:24:34,650 --> 03:24:36,110
Ah, I hit nothing, I hit nothing.

5184
03:24:36,190 --> 03:24:36,370
Ah, nice try.

5185
03:24:38,690 --> 03:24:39,050
Shit.

5186
03:24:39,850 --> 03:24:41,190
Really close, really close.

5187
03:24:44,170 --> 03:24:45,630
I think we can either ban Groot or Thor.

5188
03:24:45,630 --> 03:24:46,490
Yeah.

5189
03:24:46,710 --> 03:24:47,010
Sure.

5190
03:24:47,890 --> 03:24:49,010
That was close, damn.

5191
03:24:49,250 --> 03:24:50,490
That was a close game, yeah.

5192
03:24:52,490 --> 03:24:53,810
Thor is a problem.

5193
03:24:54,790 --> 03:24:55,950
That was, that was a problem.

5194
03:25:08,100 --> 03:25:10,820
We definitely need support, needs more peel against the Thor.

5195
03:25:12,420 --> 03:25:14,340
Yeah, I can play backline a little bit more.

5196
03:25:18,250 --> 03:25:19,850
Cause I'm, I'm missing my freeze.

5197
03:25:19,970 --> 03:25:21,370
His movement is weird.

5198
03:25:21,630 --> 03:25:25,030
I'm like, I feel like he's moving in a way I'm not predicting.

5199
03:25:25,030 --> 03:25:26,230
Or my freezes.

5200
03:25:26,350 --> 03:25:29,750
I mean, he's like, able to dps my heals on you, too.

5201
03:25:32,250 --> 03:25:34,030
Like, even when I bubble, I feel like you die.

5202
03:25:35,310 --> 03:25:43,530
Yeah, like the only way to avoid it is just I need, we need like someone to look back at us to help us, or like, even with freezes, like, it's difficult.

5203
03:25:46,150 --> 03:25:46,550
Oh.

5204
03:25:47,970 --> 03:25:48,690
Hey, Captain.

5205
03:25:49,650 --> 03:25:51,270
Oh, this guy's literally muted.

5206
03:25:51,650 --> 03:25:52,430
He hates us.

5207
03:25:52,430 --> 03:25:53,270
Sleepy, what map?

5208
03:25:54,170 --> 03:25:56,150
Um, I just go Koth, always Koth.

5209
03:26:00,290 --> 03:26:07,870
I think we have to protect Luna, though, cause Luna's the only way to actually have, like, some CC control against her.

5210
03:26:08,150 --> 03:26:08,810
I don't like that.

5211
03:26:09,490 --> 03:26:12,590
Sleepy, you know the map that we played, the first map we played last game?

5212
03:26:13,130 --> 03:26:14,090
The Bucky one?

5213
03:26:14,710 --> 03:26:16,910
I don't remember which one, but...

5214
03:26:16,910 --> 03:26:18,010
Uh, was it Koth?

5215
03:26:18,450 --> 03:26:19,210
Yeah, it was Koth.

5216
03:26:19,430 --> 03:26:20,350
Oh, it was the Bast one.

5217
03:26:20,970 --> 03:26:22,070
Yeah, I did not like that one.

5218
03:26:23,690 --> 03:26:34,210
Anything but the Bast one, because Abraham is a distinguished and handsome fellow.

5219
03:26:39,880 --> 03:26:42,160
Oh, Sleepy, you know what's funny about that game, too?

5220
03:26:42,640 --> 03:26:42,880
What?

5221
03:26:44,000 --> 03:26:46,040
We, uh, picked the wrong map for that.

5222
03:26:46,420 --> 03:26:47,000
Oh, yeah.

5223
03:26:47,240 --> 03:26:48,140
That was difficult.

5224
03:26:48,460 --> 03:26:49,380
I've been missing my...

5225
03:26:49,380 --> 03:26:50,560
I was missing my punishments, too.

5226
03:26:50,660 --> 03:26:51,200
It was my fault.

5227
03:26:51,360 --> 03:26:53,040
We were trying to play the other one.

5228
03:26:54,100 --> 03:26:55,840
It's like the same map, but not Koth.

5229
03:26:56,160 --> 03:26:58,100
I can't up Sleepy even more.

5230
03:26:58,240 --> 03:26:59,600
He's literally at 200%.

5231
03:27:00,740 --> 03:27:03,480
I have him at 200%.

5232
03:27:04,740 --> 03:27:06,080
Do the Loki one.

5233
03:27:06,080 --> 03:27:11,380
I can't push everybody higher and then everyone else lower, but is my sound guy still alive?

5234
03:27:12,380 --> 03:27:15,140
If my sound guy's alive, I can put everybody lower.

5235
03:27:15,420 --> 03:27:16,960
I mean, he owns some of the times.

5236
03:27:17,400 --> 03:27:19,320
Dude, triple support is so fucking annoying.

5237
03:27:19,900 --> 03:27:21,360
I feel like maybe we should just...

5238
03:27:21,900 --> 03:27:24,520
Maybe we should just run triple support at that point.

5239
03:27:27,200 --> 03:27:30,220
I mean, maybe we should for sustainability.

5240
03:27:38,380 --> 03:27:38,820
Uh...

5241
03:27:38,820 --> 03:27:40,900
Did Loki not blame people for once?

5242
03:27:41,040 --> 03:27:43,800
I was... Okay, but to be fair, I was getting a lot of peel, too.

5243
03:27:45,100 --> 03:27:46,560
I don't really care about banning Thor.

5244
03:27:46,780 --> 03:27:47,920
I don't...

5245
03:27:47,920 --> 03:27:50,580
It's not really like ban-worthy.

5246
03:27:51,600 --> 03:27:54,100
I don't think it's... Are my sound people still alive?

5247
03:27:54,360 --> 03:27:57,060
Dude, healers are getting or having a hard time.

5248
03:27:57,600 --> 03:28:00,360
Yeah, I mean, I could just... Should I just play back?

5249
03:28:00,420 --> 03:28:02,780
Because I kind of... If I'm playing Starlord, I'd melt Thor.

5250
03:28:03,220 --> 03:28:04,520
I could play a little bit back, too.

5251
03:28:04,620 --> 03:28:05,660
I mean, because I have mobility.

5252
03:28:05,840 --> 03:28:07,040
I can use E to get back there.

5253
03:28:07,260 --> 03:28:08,420
So, like...

5254
03:28:08,420 --> 03:28:09,640
I could just play a little bit more back.

5255
03:28:09,740 --> 03:28:10,360
I've been trying to get there.

5256
03:28:10,460 --> 03:28:12,820
But what can you do to Thor?

5257
03:28:12,960 --> 03:28:18,020
From my POV, Thor is killing me and my supports on cooldown and I can't kill him fast enough to help anybody.

5258
03:28:18,160 --> 03:28:19,520
So, either someone needs to come back and help.

5259
03:28:19,520 --> 03:28:19,940
Yeah.

5260
03:28:20,740 --> 03:28:24,240
I can pull Thor and pull him back.

5261
03:28:25,440 --> 03:28:27,320
I don't know if it's worth it, but I can do that.

5262
03:28:27,520 --> 03:28:29,120
Starlord's probably better because he actually melts.

5263
03:28:29,300 --> 03:28:30,520
I think someone with damage does it.

5264
03:28:30,840 --> 03:28:31,540
Sure, it's fine.

5265
03:28:31,740 --> 03:28:33,260
Or you just... I mean, I legit...

5266
03:28:33,260 --> 03:28:34,220
Skrull girl was good.

5267
03:28:34,680 --> 03:28:35,660
You fucking...

5268
03:28:35,660 --> 03:28:36,440
You hate me for swapping.

5269
03:28:37,280 --> 03:28:37,800
Why are we banning?

5270
03:28:37,840 --> 03:28:38,240
Why are we banning?

5271
03:28:38,920 --> 03:28:40,400
I'm still banning Strange.

5272
03:28:40,880 --> 03:28:41,120
Groot?

5273
03:28:41,360 --> 03:28:42,040
Do we want to get Groot?

5274
03:28:42,080 --> 03:28:42,640
Yeah, ban Strange.

5275
03:28:43,480 --> 03:28:44,940
We might protect Groot, though.

5276
03:28:45,580 --> 03:28:45,880
Oh.

5277
03:28:45,880 --> 03:28:45,900
Oh.

5278
03:28:47,680 --> 03:28:49,000
It's better to get Strange up, though.

5279
03:28:49,100 --> 03:28:49,680
Yeah, that's true.

5280
03:28:51,440 --> 03:28:52,400
Save Luna, right?

5281
03:28:53,740 --> 03:28:55,040
Maybe save Invis?

5282
03:28:57,740 --> 03:28:58,900
Invis for push, yeah.

5283
03:29:00,260 --> 03:29:00,880
We could.

5284
03:29:01,700 --> 03:29:03,740
Doki, you play other characters, right?

5285
03:29:03,760 --> 03:29:04,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5286
03:29:04,160 --> 03:29:04,520
I'll save.

5287
03:29:04,660 --> 03:29:04,960
I'll save.

5288
03:29:05,400 --> 03:29:06,960
Yeah, I play any support.

5289
03:29:07,520 --> 03:29:08,960
Because they banned Sue last game.

5290
03:29:09,140 --> 03:29:10,520
Yeah, because like...

5291
03:29:10,900 --> 03:29:14,720
I wanted to save Luna just because of the fact that Luna also has her freeze.

5292
03:29:14,980 --> 03:29:17,560
But if we have Sue's push, then that works, too.

5293
03:29:19,820 --> 03:29:20,460
Who are we banning?

5294
03:29:20,540 --> 03:29:20,900
Ours?

5295
03:29:21,280 --> 03:29:21,540
Groot, right?

5296
03:29:24,800 --> 03:29:25,200
Why?

5297
03:29:25,320 --> 03:29:25,940
What did I do?

5298
03:29:27,340 --> 03:29:28,180
What did I do?

5299
03:29:29,380 --> 03:29:30,480
Yeah, I'll ban Groot.

5300
03:29:30,680 --> 03:29:32,060
They're just going to abuse the combo.

5301
03:29:32,700 --> 03:29:34,940
Because they were trying to abuse it over and over again.

5302
03:29:35,680 --> 03:29:35,900
Oh.

5303
03:29:37,860 --> 03:29:38,420
The fuck?

5304
03:29:41,960 --> 03:29:43,700
If the Thor is diving, I don't have to play Sarl.

5305
03:29:43,740 --> 03:29:44,880
I can play like Namor.

5306
03:29:45,200 --> 03:29:45,560
Yeah, yeah.

5307
03:29:45,640 --> 03:29:47,360
I think if you play...

5308
03:29:48,200 --> 03:29:48,480
Okay.

5309
03:29:53,240 --> 03:29:54,120
Sounds so sad.

5310
03:29:54,200 --> 03:29:56,000
If I'm in a trouble support, we can do Namor.

5311
03:29:56,160 --> 03:29:57,880
But if I'm DPS, go Skrull Girl.

5312
03:29:57,960 --> 03:29:59,400
We were legit owning the Thor last game.

5313
03:29:59,740 --> 03:30:01,380
When you went Skrull Girl, then you swapped.

5314
03:30:01,500 --> 03:30:02,320
That's why I said fuck you.

5315
03:30:03,680 --> 03:30:04,080
Wait, wait.

5316
03:30:04,120 --> 03:30:04,660
What did you say?

5317
03:30:05,920 --> 03:30:06,320
When...

5318
03:30:06,320 --> 03:30:09,800
When you were on Skrull Girl, focusing Thor last game, we were like owning him.

5319
03:30:10,400 --> 03:30:11,540
And then you swapped to Starlord.

5320
03:30:11,720 --> 03:30:12,960
Because you just fucking hate me for some reason.

5321
03:30:14,200 --> 03:30:15,240
That's why I said fuck you.

5322
03:30:16,280 --> 03:30:20,300
Honestly, I feel like I was doing more against the Thor.

5323
03:30:20,780 --> 03:30:21,600
Like at Starlord.

5324
03:30:21,680 --> 03:30:23,240
I was shredding him.

5325
03:30:23,740 --> 03:30:25,080
I think I'm worried about the damage.

5326
03:30:25,940 --> 03:30:27,040
It's so good.

5327
03:30:28,780 --> 03:30:30,440
I'm just giving out armor.

5328
03:30:31,640 --> 03:30:32,380
You can Namor here though.

5329
03:30:32,380 --> 03:30:33,160
Namor is pretty good here.

5330
03:30:34,340 --> 03:30:36,940
I would rather Namor Starlord on this point.

5331
03:30:37,460 --> 03:30:38,560
Do Namor because you have triple support.

5332
03:30:39,300 --> 03:30:39,820
Wait, you have triple?

5333
03:30:40,000 --> 03:30:40,300
Oh yeah.

5334
03:30:40,420 --> 03:30:41,000
No, oh yeah.

5335
03:30:42,860 --> 03:30:43,740
No, I'm playing this.

5336
03:30:44,340 --> 03:30:44,580
Please.

5337
03:30:46,600 --> 03:30:48,000
Oh, you just want to give out armor.

5338
03:30:48,580 --> 03:30:49,300
Oh, min maxing?

5339
03:30:49,380 --> 03:30:50,220
Okay, get the Jeff.

5340
03:30:50,440 --> 03:30:51,560
Six bubbles.

5341
03:30:53,180 --> 03:30:53,940
Grab the extra jump.

5342
03:30:54,340 --> 03:30:54,960
Grab the extra jump.

5343
03:30:56,060 --> 03:30:56,220
Okay.

5344
03:30:57,820 --> 03:30:58,800
Grab the extra jump.

5345
03:30:58,800 --> 03:31:00,040
We have triple support.

5346
03:31:00,540 --> 03:31:01,240
We're just fine.

5347
03:31:02,080 --> 03:31:03,380
People just don't want double jump.

5348
03:31:03,980 --> 03:31:05,740
No, fuck that shit.

5349
03:31:06,620 --> 03:31:07,280
We're going to play what?

5350
03:31:07,780 --> 03:31:09,100
A lot more around our front line this game.

5351
03:31:10,300 --> 03:31:11,260
We'll play front to back.

5352
03:31:12,000 --> 03:31:12,460
No, no, no.

5353
03:31:12,960 --> 03:31:14,580
We have triple support.

5354
03:31:16,200 --> 03:31:17,660
I can be reckless now.

5355
03:31:18,520 --> 03:31:19,580
They're super dive.

5356
03:31:19,860 --> 03:31:21,320
We can survive any dive.

5357
03:31:23,320 --> 03:31:23,940
Walk in here.

5358
03:31:25,000 --> 03:31:26,020
They're playing cap as well.

5359
03:31:29,440 --> 03:31:30,420
We can fight this on top.

5360
03:31:30,540 --> 03:31:30,840
Can we walk up?

5361
03:31:31,360 --> 03:31:31,820
Yeah, I'm walking up.

5362
03:31:32,560 --> 03:31:34,080
We have cap america on us.

5363
03:31:34,420 --> 03:31:34,720
That's fine.

5364
03:31:36,780 --> 03:31:37,700
I'm walking up.

5365
03:31:38,840 --> 03:31:39,260
Any heals?

5366
03:31:40,000 --> 03:31:40,320
Yeah, yeah.

5367
03:31:43,380 --> 03:31:44,100
Kill hella.

5368
03:31:44,520 --> 03:31:45,260
Wait, focus hella.

5369
03:31:46,580 --> 03:31:47,100
Hella half.

5370
03:31:47,480 --> 03:31:48,100
I got hella.

5371
03:31:50,080 --> 03:31:51,320
I froze cap america.

5372
03:31:52,300 --> 03:31:52,580
Kill cap.

5373
03:31:52,580 --> 03:31:52,880
Kill cap.

5374
03:31:54,040 --> 03:31:55,320
Thor is half.

5375
03:31:57,080 --> 03:31:58,080
Thor is dead.

5376
03:31:58,560 --> 03:31:59,280
Everyone go point.

5377
03:31:59,960 --> 03:32:01,020
No more is up top.

5378
03:32:02,840 --> 03:32:03,880
Focus cap.

5379
03:32:03,960 --> 03:32:04,980
Cap america is on point.

5380
03:32:05,300 --> 03:32:06,160
We need to get point control.

5381
03:32:07,840 --> 03:32:09,080
Focus cap if we can.

5382
03:32:10,380 --> 03:32:10,900
Yeah.

5383
03:32:12,000 --> 03:32:13,920
I am ready to put on a show.

5384
03:32:14,540 --> 03:32:15,500
They have support now.

5385
03:32:15,800 --> 03:32:16,700
I can probably get my ult.

5386
03:32:18,680 --> 03:32:19,400
We're leaving.

5387
03:32:19,400 --> 03:32:20,280
We're leaving for a sec.

5388
03:32:21,320 --> 03:32:21,880
We're good.

5389
03:32:22,540 --> 03:32:23,560
I have ult.

5390
03:32:23,640 --> 03:32:24,660
I'm gonna ult first.

5391
03:32:26,820 --> 03:32:27,860
Come point.

5392
03:32:29,700 --> 03:32:30,980
I'm ulting over point.

5393
03:32:36,420 --> 03:32:37,260
Thor half.

5394
03:32:37,960 --> 03:32:38,720
Thor low.

5395
03:32:43,810 --> 03:32:45,350
I'm going to use my next one.

5396
03:32:47,130 --> 03:32:47,830
I'm damage boosting.

5397
03:32:51,230 --> 03:32:52,450
Oh my god.

5398
03:32:53,030 --> 03:32:54,390
I'm damage boosting the cap.

5399
03:32:57,810 --> 03:32:58,350
Kill Thor.

5400
03:32:59,650 --> 03:33:01,010
I got him.

5401
03:33:01,170 --> 03:33:01,470
Cap.

5402
03:33:04,030 --> 03:33:06,030
We need to never lose point cap.

5403
03:33:06,150 --> 03:33:06,830
Now that we have it.

5404
03:33:06,950 --> 03:33:07,630
I can't believe it.

5405
03:33:10,450 --> 03:33:12,470
I'm on left side.

5406
03:33:14,510 --> 03:33:15,470
I'm gonna play high with you.

5407
03:33:17,090 --> 03:33:18,670
I'm staying on point the whole time.

5408
03:33:18,670 --> 03:33:19,170
I need heals.

5409
03:33:19,570 --> 03:33:23,650
My husband gave him a mistake.

5410
03:33:23,890 --> 03:33:24,290
On the side.

5411
03:33:24,630 --> 03:33:27,310
We can fight them on top.

5412
03:33:28,650 --> 03:33:29,430
I have shield.

5413
03:33:32,190 --> 03:33:34,970
I need help.

5414
03:33:35,670 --> 03:33:36,270
I froze cap.

5415
03:33:38,530 --> 03:33:40,690
Guys, we can't give up point if possible.

5416
03:33:41,450 --> 03:33:42,510
I'm on it.

5417
03:33:44,410 --> 03:33:46,210
We're down both supports.

5418
03:33:49,250 --> 03:33:50,470
We just didn't have...

5419
03:33:50,470 --> 03:33:51,910
There's a support ult for that.

5420
03:33:53,110 --> 03:33:54,430
I have to go cave it up.

5421
03:34:01,070 --> 03:34:02,970
We have double support now.

5422
03:34:03,210 --> 03:34:03,430
We're there.

5423
03:34:15,070 --> 03:34:16,250
I'm coming soon.

5424
03:34:18,630 --> 03:34:20,150
Walk to height first.

5425
03:34:25,150 --> 03:34:27,090
I'm walking now.

5426
03:34:28,030 --> 03:34:31,910
We have to fight this.

5427
03:34:33,050 --> 03:34:35,150
I'm looking to drop in.

5428
03:34:35,710 --> 03:34:36,950
I froze him.

5429
03:34:42,690 --> 03:34:45,590
Just make them waste ult.

5430
03:34:48,490 --> 03:34:53,070
I have to jump in there.

5431
03:35:06,790 --> 03:35:07,910
It's so annoying.

5432
03:35:10,230 --> 03:35:11,470
More damage will be good.

5433
03:35:11,970 --> 03:35:13,490
I need to play DPS.

5434
03:35:13,630 --> 03:35:14,910
I can't triple with that.

5435
03:35:15,250 --> 03:35:16,110
I don't know what to play.

5436
03:35:19,290 --> 03:35:22,890
You can play it.

5437
03:35:22,950 --> 03:35:24,110
Ape can play something else.

5438
03:35:24,110 --> 03:35:25,790
I think...

5439
03:35:26,630 --> 03:35:28,110
I don't play wolves a problem.

5440
03:35:28,570 --> 03:35:31,010
I think our frontline can be more aggressive on their backline.

5441
03:35:32,190 --> 03:35:35,550
I think you two together, as long as you're getting healed enough from our backline...

5442
03:35:35,550 --> 03:35:37,210
I don't think it's an issue.

5443
03:35:37,410 --> 03:35:38,610
I think you guys are turning around too much.

5444
03:35:39,110 --> 03:35:41,090
Look at their Hella and their squishy smorcs.

5445
03:35:41,330 --> 03:35:41,950
Don't worry about the cap.

5446
03:35:42,050 --> 03:35:42,650
The cap is bait.

5447
03:35:43,650 --> 03:35:45,450
I swear I heard nothing from him.

5448
03:35:45,630 --> 03:35:46,010
I was.

5449
03:35:46,090 --> 03:35:46,670
I'm here now.

5450
03:35:49,710 --> 03:35:51,790
You can 3-4 pump.

5451
03:35:54,110 --> 03:35:55,510
Yeah, but the problem is...

5452
03:35:55,510 --> 03:35:58,070
I missed my shots on the fucking...

5453
03:35:58,070 --> 03:35:59,410
Either way, it's just pressure.

5454
03:36:01,210 --> 03:36:02,470
Yeah, I can pressure backline.

5455
03:36:02,690 --> 03:36:03,210
I'll just do that.

5456
03:36:03,550 --> 03:36:05,110
I think our frontline can pressure backline a bit more.

5457
03:36:06,770 --> 03:36:11,150
After I die and use my ult, I think I'm going to swap off to Starlord.

5458
03:36:14,990 --> 03:36:15,890
Dude, top right.

5459
03:36:18,150 --> 03:36:18,910
Is that a Panther?

5460
03:36:18,910 --> 03:36:19,830
I'm going for a dive.

5461
03:36:25,090 --> 03:36:27,610
No, I'm okay.

5462
03:36:27,670 --> 03:36:27,970
I'm okay.

5463
03:36:28,370 --> 03:36:28,990
Thor has.

5464
03:36:32,130 --> 03:36:32,830
Thor 1.

5465
03:36:32,850 --> 03:36:33,330
Thor 1.

5466
03:36:33,410 --> 03:36:33,850
Thor 1.

5467
03:36:33,890 --> 03:36:35,750
Thor is still low.

5468
03:36:35,990 --> 03:36:36,610
I got him.

5469
03:36:36,750 --> 03:36:36,930
I got him.

5470
03:36:40,350 --> 03:36:41,490
Captain America 1.

5471
03:36:41,610 --> 03:36:42,310
Captain America 1.

5472
03:36:42,350 --> 03:36:43,270
Just focus on him.

5473
03:36:48,910 --> 03:36:49,190
I'm going to ult first.

5474
03:36:51,710 --> 03:36:52,990
They didn't use anything.

5475
03:36:53,090 --> 03:36:54,270
They used their ult.

5476
03:36:58,350 --> 03:37:00,010
You can ult first.

5477
03:37:11,350 --> 03:37:13,910
He's looking to dive.

5478
03:37:13,990 --> 03:37:14,850
They're looking to dive us now.

5479
03:37:18,910 --> 03:37:19,890
Thor can dive.

5480
03:37:22,590 --> 03:37:22,650
Thor can dive.

5481
03:37:24,110 --> 03:37:24,590
Let's go.

5482
03:37:24,670 --> 03:37:24,870
Let's go.

5483
03:37:25,310 --> 03:37:25,710
Walk up.

5484
03:37:25,770 --> 03:37:25,950
Walk up.

5485
03:37:26,390 --> 03:37:32,570
I have to use it then.

5486
03:37:32,750 --> 03:37:33,710
He was going to kill me if I didn't.

5487
03:37:35,990 --> 03:37:37,950
Dude, kill the hell...

5488
03:37:42,930 --> 03:37:44,310
3, 2, 1.

5489
03:37:44,370 --> 03:37:44,870
We have to solve.

5490
03:37:49,850 --> 03:37:50,790
I'm dead here.

5491
03:37:51,590 --> 03:37:52,530
Kill the support.

5492
03:37:53,110 --> 03:37:53,950
Look at Captain America.

5493
03:37:55,150 --> 03:37:56,450
Captain America is so low.

5494
03:37:59,230 --> 03:38:00,430
They still don't have point.

5495
03:38:00,510 --> 03:38:01,070
He still doesn't have point.

5496
03:38:01,730 --> 03:38:02,610
I can't walk in.

5497
03:38:03,470 --> 03:38:04,030
That's fine.

5498
03:38:06,050 --> 03:38:06,690
We're even.

5499
03:38:07,190 --> 03:38:07,410
We're even.

5500
03:38:08,550 --> 03:38:09,430
I'm walking in.

5501
03:38:09,630 --> 03:38:10,030
I'm walking in.

5502
03:38:10,270 --> 03:38:10,870
I need help.

5503
03:38:11,090 --> 03:38:11,450
I got you.

5504
03:38:11,490 --> 03:38:11,790
I got you.

5505
03:38:12,970 --> 03:38:13,890
I'm looking at Luna.

5506
03:38:13,890 --> 03:38:14,430
I'm looking at Luna.

5507
03:38:15,650 --> 03:38:17,130
Okay, but now I need help.

5508
03:38:17,950 --> 03:38:18,270
Thor behind.

5509
03:38:18,630 --> 03:38:18,750
Thor behind.

5510
03:38:18,870 --> 03:38:19,690
Thor on me.

5511
03:38:19,770 --> 03:38:20,150
Thor on me.

5512
03:38:20,190 --> 03:38:20,650
Thor on me.

5513
03:38:21,550 --> 03:38:22,290
That's where I lose him.

5514
03:38:26,700 --> 03:38:27,220
I'm swapping.

5515
03:38:27,360 --> 03:38:27,620
I'm swapping.

5516
03:38:33,310 --> 03:38:33,870
I'm going to stay.

5517
03:38:35,110 --> 03:38:35,250
Okay.

5518
03:38:48,030 --> 03:38:49,050
Can we walk to the left?

5519
03:38:49,050 --> 03:38:50,190
This is right side.

5520
03:38:52,370 --> 03:38:53,170
I'm at 86.

5521
03:38:53,290 --> 03:38:54,070
Can we go backline?

5522
03:38:54,990 --> 03:38:56,050
I'm looking at backline.

5523
03:38:56,630 --> 03:38:57,030
Backline.

5524
03:38:59,250 --> 03:39:00,050
I'm shielding.

5525
03:39:01,390 --> 03:39:02,450
Thor is looking.

5526
03:39:02,530 --> 03:39:03,290
Thor is looking now.

5527
03:39:04,870 --> 03:39:05,470
I have to ult this.

5528
03:39:05,530 --> 03:39:06,210
I'm ulting this.

5529
03:39:07,910 --> 03:39:09,230
I didn't want to die here.

5530
03:39:14,750 --> 03:39:15,550
He died.

5531
03:39:15,670 --> 03:39:16,030
He fell off.

5532
03:39:16,030 --> 03:39:16,770
Oh my god.

5533
03:39:18,570 --> 03:39:19,410
25 more.

5534
03:39:20,010 --> 03:39:20,430
Yup.

5535
03:39:21,770 --> 03:39:22,890
Actually, I don't think I need it.

5536
03:39:22,970 --> 03:39:24,170
I wish I just died for it.

5537
03:39:32,310 --> 03:39:33,550
I'll chase backline.

5538
03:39:33,710 --> 03:39:34,090
I have to reload.

5539
03:39:36,250 --> 03:39:37,090
Hold two.

5540
03:39:39,510 --> 03:39:40,150
I'm ulting.

5541
03:39:40,430 --> 03:39:40,830
Get in.

5542
03:39:40,930 --> 03:39:41,210
Get in.

5543
03:39:44,970 --> 03:39:46,570
I have a Thor in the back.

5544
03:39:46,690 --> 03:39:47,750
That's just hitting me.

5545
03:39:48,650 --> 03:39:48,830
Nice.

5546
03:39:48,990 --> 03:39:48,990
Nice.

5547
03:39:49,090 --> 03:39:49,230
Nice.

5548
03:39:49,950 --> 03:39:50,850
I'm dead.

5549
03:39:52,130 --> 03:39:53,450
I couldn't heal.

5550
03:39:54,130 --> 03:39:55,370
I froze him.

5551
03:39:55,490 --> 03:39:55,830
I froze him.

5552
03:40:00,650 --> 03:40:01,950
I pushed him.

5553
03:40:05,270 --> 03:40:06,610
I'm too low.

5554
03:40:06,610 --> 03:40:07,790
I'm too low.

5555
03:40:08,370 --> 03:40:09,270
I'm on Luna.

5556
03:40:09,390 --> 03:40:09,690
I'm on Luna.

5557
03:40:09,950 --> 03:40:12,050
I froze somebody, but I don't know who, but I'm going to die here.

5558
03:40:13,270 --> 03:40:14,690
I couldn't ult there.

5559
03:40:14,890 --> 03:40:15,390
It's looking good.

5560
03:40:15,450 --> 03:40:15,810
It's looking good.

5561
03:40:16,990 --> 03:40:17,890
Just stay on point.

5562
03:40:17,990 --> 03:40:18,690
Just stay on point here.

5563
03:40:22,430 --> 03:40:22,810
I'm dead.

5564
03:40:25,790 --> 03:40:27,230
I have ult here.

5565
03:40:28,110 --> 03:40:28,990
Oh no, I don't.

5566
03:40:29,530 --> 03:40:29,790
This guy.

5567
03:40:31,610 --> 03:40:34,010
He's trying to stall.

5568
03:40:37,710 --> 03:40:39,230
I was trying to kite you the whole time.

5569
03:40:41,290 --> 03:40:42,050
I'm just...

5570
03:40:42,480 --> 03:40:44,470
I'm saving all my freezes on the dives.

5571
03:40:44,710 --> 03:40:45,610
I can only...

5572
03:40:45,610 --> 03:40:48,990
I can only freeze two of them.

5573
03:40:49,130 --> 03:40:49,670
One of them.

5574
03:40:57,800 --> 03:40:58,560
Thor one.

5575
03:41:00,480 --> 03:41:01,080
Thor one.

5576
03:41:01,280 --> 03:41:02,000
I'm using this.

5577
03:41:02,080 --> 03:41:02,620
I'm using this.

5578
03:41:02,720 --> 03:41:03,720
No, no, no.

5579
03:41:03,740 --> 03:41:04,000
We're fine.

5580
03:41:04,080 --> 03:41:04,260
We're fine.

5581
03:41:04,360 --> 03:41:04,560
We're fine.

5582
03:41:04,560 --> 03:41:05,060
I know.

5583
03:41:05,220 --> 03:41:05,220
I know.

5584
03:41:06,500 --> 03:41:07,160
Just kill Cap.

5585
03:41:07,220 --> 03:41:08,740
I'm damage boosting.

5586
03:41:09,240 --> 03:41:09,640
Just kill him.

5587
03:41:09,740 --> 03:41:10,040
Just kill him.

5588
03:41:11,340 --> 03:41:12,280
They're all damage boosters.

5589
03:41:13,180 --> 03:41:14,220
We capped this.

5590
03:41:17,500 --> 03:41:17,860
Thor.

5591
03:41:17,860 --> 03:41:18,220
Thor.

5592
03:41:18,260 --> 03:41:18,380
Thor.

5593
03:41:18,500 --> 03:41:18,660
Thor.

5594
03:41:18,740 --> 03:41:19,420
Focus Thor.

5595
03:41:22,840 --> 03:41:23,200
Nice.

5596
03:41:26,160 --> 03:41:26,780
Good stuff.

5597
03:41:30,040 --> 03:41:30,600
One more.

5598
03:41:30,700 --> 03:41:30,920
One more.

5599
03:41:30,980 --> 03:41:31,200
One more.

5600
03:41:31,200 --> 03:41:31,440
Alright.

5601
03:41:31,780 --> 03:41:31,780
Alright.

5602
03:41:32,000 --> 03:41:32,000
Alright.

5603
03:41:32,220 --> 03:41:33,880
We almost have two ults.

5604
03:41:38,040 --> 03:41:40,160
You're just leaving you guys in the back.

5605
03:41:40,340 --> 03:41:41,000
Like, good luck.

5606
03:41:52,720 --> 03:41:54,260
They have their support ults.

5607
03:41:54,420 --> 03:41:55,040
They didn't use any.

5608
03:41:56,440 --> 03:41:57,120
They should have Luna.

5609
03:41:57,320 --> 03:41:58,760
I don't think they used the Luna ult yet.

5610
03:42:01,500 --> 03:42:03,080
30 seconds before you attack.

5611
03:42:03,440 --> 03:42:03,940
Get ready.

5612
03:42:04,380 --> 03:42:06,160
I honestly don't even know if I want to use this ult.

5613
03:42:07,220 --> 03:42:09,380
You can use it to get rid of their support ult.

5614
03:42:09,540 --> 03:42:09,620
Maybe.

5615
03:42:11,200 --> 03:42:12,940
Yeah, I think just force it out.

5616
03:42:13,480 --> 03:42:15,660
Force it out and then Abe can maybe have a...

5617
03:42:15,660 --> 03:42:16,540
Or Abe might have it.

5618
03:42:17,480 --> 03:42:21,840
Abe, when they support ult, by the way, I'll fuck in front of them, drool, and walk out of it.

5619
03:42:21,960 --> 03:42:22,520
Look for that.

5620
03:42:23,000 --> 03:42:23,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5621
03:42:23,700 --> 03:42:24,500
I have been.

5622
03:42:24,700 --> 03:42:24,800
I have been.

5623
03:42:24,980 --> 03:42:26,340
Like, outside of the school.

5624
03:42:26,540 --> 03:42:26,900
Do I ult?

5625
03:42:26,940 --> 03:42:27,420
Can I get it?

5626
03:42:27,860 --> 03:42:28,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5627
03:42:28,840 --> 03:42:29,500
If we need it, if we need it.

5628
03:42:30,540 --> 03:42:32,020
We'll see what the situation is like.

5629
03:42:36,460 --> 03:42:48,140
We can just invis the ult on the point then.

5630
03:42:51,640 --> 03:42:57,420
We might have to save or a shield for our invisible woman if we use a mag ult.

5631
03:42:58,820 --> 03:42:59,580
I can jump it.

5632
03:42:59,840 --> 03:43:00,980
It's almost never a problem.

5633
03:43:01,700 --> 03:43:02,160
I'm falling now.

5634
03:43:02,380 --> 03:43:02,540
I'm falling now.

5635
03:43:02,840 --> 03:43:03,740
I have it.

5636
03:43:05,440 --> 03:43:06,540
I don't have it yet.

5637
03:43:10,580 --> 03:43:11,220
I'm going back.

5638
03:43:11,560 --> 03:43:13,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5639
03:43:13,840 --> 03:43:14,560
I'm here with you.

5640
03:43:14,740 --> 03:43:15,120
I'm with you.

5641
03:43:15,240 --> 03:43:15,760
I'm with you.

5642
03:43:17,580 --> 03:43:18,220
No more ults.

5643
03:43:18,340 --> 03:43:18,560
No more ults.

5644
03:43:18,960 --> 03:43:19,460
Throw one up.

5645
03:43:19,540 --> 03:43:19,920
Throw one up.

5646
03:43:21,300 --> 03:43:22,020
Everyone up.

5647
03:43:22,100 --> 03:43:23,660
Everyone up.

5648
03:43:23,660 --> 03:43:24,580
Holding top.

5649
03:43:25,480 --> 03:43:26,620
They used cloak.

5650
03:43:26,860 --> 03:43:28,600
They're gonna have Luna.

5651
03:43:28,820 --> 03:43:29,200
That's it.

5652
03:43:29,700 --> 03:43:31,120
They have mag ult.

5653
03:43:44,320 --> 03:43:47,280
I don't see a Thor, so careful.

5654
03:43:48,020 --> 03:43:49,260
Thor's on the left side.

5655
03:43:49,660 --> 03:43:51,120
In, in, in, in.

5656
03:43:51,120 --> 03:43:51,840
Oh my god.

5657
03:43:51,900 --> 03:43:53,120
Thor's right there.

5658
03:43:53,620 --> 03:43:59,680
I can't get to you.

5659
03:43:59,680 --> 03:44:01,560
I'm on point.

5660
03:44:02,700 --> 03:44:05,360
I can't get to you.

5661
03:44:07,280 --> 03:44:13,080
They accidentally dropped down there.

5662
03:44:13,620 --> 03:44:14,040
That's okay.

5663
03:44:14,200 --> 03:44:15,680
They have Thor.

5664
03:44:18,260 --> 03:44:21,080
They shouldn't have cloak ult yet.

5665
03:44:22,200 --> 03:44:24,960
So we should have a free We should have a free ult then.

5666
03:44:35,440 --> 03:44:36,360
He's waiting.

5667
03:44:36,840 --> 03:44:36,980
He's waiting.

5668
03:44:39,060 --> 03:44:40,060
I'm trying to get to you.

5669
03:44:41,420 --> 03:44:42,260
We're down two.

5670
03:44:42,260 --> 03:44:44,400
Yeah, we're down three now.

5671
03:44:58,960 --> 03:45:00,320
Oh, they're in.

5672
03:45:00,380 --> 03:45:02,060
I need help here.

5673
03:45:02,260 --> 03:45:04,140
Oh, sorry man.

5674
03:45:04,200 --> 03:45:05,060
Just reset.

5675
03:45:05,060 --> 03:45:05,360
It's fine.

5676
03:45:16,480 --> 03:45:17,840
He's going to have mag ult again.

5677
03:45:22,100 --> 03:45:23,480
Can I just go to point?

5678
03:45:25,840 --> 03:45:30,300
Yeah, I gave him snowflake.

5679
03:45:31,160 --> 03:45:31,720
They know.

5680
03:45:35,380 --> 03:45:36,260
I'm reloading.

5681
03:45:36,540 --> 03:45:37,540
Go, go, go, go.

5682
03:45:37,920 --> 03:45:38,580
I see it.

5683
03:45:38,580 --> 03:45:39,300
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

5684
03:45:43,760 --> 03:45:44,980
I'm taking my Gido here.

5685
03:45:45,940 --> 03:45:47,100
Mag one, mag one, mag one.

5686
03:45:47,220 --> 03:45:48,140
We can kill him.

5687
03:45:49,240 --> 03:45:51,180
They're chasing me so fucking hard.

5688
03:45:56,780 --> 03:45:57,820
I missed it.

5689
03:45:58,640 --> 03:45:59,920
I missed my freeze.

5690
03:46:00,020 --> 03:46:00,640
That was my bad.

5691
03:46:05,340 --> 03:46:07,800
We can invisible ult as soon as you get there.

5692
03:46:10,900 --> 03:46:11,820
Can you touch it?

5693
03:46:12,080 --> 03:46:12,180
Nice.

5694
03:46:15,320 --> 03:46:16,200
Help me!

5695
03:46:17,960 --> 03:46:21,540
I'm coming in, I'm coming in.

5696
03:46:22,260 --> 03:46:24,240
I got her, I got her.

5697
03:46:33,420 --> 03:46:35,060
Thor's going to be on me, Thor's going to be on me.

5698
03:46:35,060 --> 03:46:36,920
I'm not there yet.

5699
03:46:37,340 --> 03:46:39,940
That was

5700
03:46:47,550 --> 03:46:48,030
close.

5701
03:46:48,610 --> 03:46:52,890
We got one round.

5702
03:46:53,950 --> 03:46:56,670
Yeah, that was a close game, close game.

5703
03:46:59,230 --> 03:46:59,990
GG.

5704
03:47:29,160 --> 03:47:31,720
Oh man, that was rough.

5705
03:47:31,720 --> 03:47:34,380
I missed the last few freezes that were important.

5706
03:47:35,040 --> 03:47:36,520
But his movement is so...

5707
03:47:36,520 --> 03:47:38,040
Because I don't play against a lot of Thors.

5708
03:47:38,940 --> 03:47:41,720
I don't play against a lot of Thors.

5709
03:47:42,260 --> 03:47:46,420
So predicting Thor's movement is hard because he glides and stuff.

5710
03:47:48,120 --> 03:47:51,340
That last round, I needed to predict.

5711
03:47:51,580 --> 03:47:53,020
I needed to predict.

5712
03:47:53,540 --> 03:47:56,160
I needed to hit those last two freezes.

5713
03:47:56,560 --> 03:47:57,100
By the way,

5714
03:48:01,880 --> 03:48:06,180
every time I stop the Thor, we win.

5715
03:48:06,400 --> 03:48:07,900
Every time we win a fight.

5716
03:48:08,780 --> 03:48:11,960
And I had like two people diving me so it was so difficult.

5717
03:48:12,080 --> 03:48:13,160
It was so fucking difficult.

5718
03:48:13,820 --> 03:48:20,300
Because I had two dive tanks on me every time and I could only freeze one of the dive tanks every time.

5719
03:48:21,840 --> 03:48:27,700
And what's really rough is that John or Mayoshi is the same tier as me.

5720
03:48:28,240 --> 03:48:28,720
Masayoshi.

5721
03:48:28,720 --> 03:48:34,360
So I feel bad because they get a Celestial tank and then they get me.

5722
03:48:39,340 --> 03:48:44,840
So I'm the same tier as the other tank player.

5723
03:48:45,140 --> 03:48:46,480
So they get like two tanks.

5724
03:48:46,740 --> 03:48:47,280
Or anybody.

5725
03:48:47,480 --> 03:48:48,640
Maybe like 25 and 0.

5726
03:48:49,260 --> 03:48:51,520
I might have the worst record.

5727
03:48:52,900 --> 03:48:54,780
I won one.

5728
03:48:54,960 --> 03:48:56,720
No, I have one too.

5729
03:48:57,240 --> 03:48:58,020
It's alright.

5730
03:48:58,620 --> 03:49:01,740
I think somebody hasn't won yet.

5731
03:49:03,460 --> 03:49:04,520
Oh wait, no.

5732
03:49:05,020 --> 03:49:05,860
Everybody's won one.

5733
03:49:06,020 --> 03:49:07,240
Everybody's won at least one.

5734
03:49:08,700 --> 03:49:10,040
Cutie is 7-0.

5735
03:49:11,500 --> 03:49:11,940
Yeah.

5736
03:49:13,000 --> 03:49:15,400
Me and Selene are fighting for second to see if we can make it.

5737
03:49:15,960 --> 03:49:18,560
Well you gotta beat xQc then to get it.

5738
03:49:18,660 --> 03:49:19,140
I know.

5739
03:49:19,640 --> 03:49:21,900
Well we gotta win 2-0 I think because we might win this one.

5740
03:49:22,520 --> 03:49:24,360
We'll see.

5741
03:49:24,360 --> 03:49:25,200
Wait for what?

5742
03:49:26,180 --> 03:49:26,440
Yeah.

5743
03:49:28,020 --> 03:49:34,700
Apparently in Marvel Rivals support is the hardest to make an impact.

5744
03:49:36,260 --> 03:49:41,500
Because you know all we can do is just keep people alive.

5745
03:49:41,720 --> 03:49:43,840
Or freeze them.

5746
03:49:44,700 --> 03:49:47,900
And then we have to make sure something has to happen after that.

5747
03:49:47,900 --> 03:49:48,580
LOL

5748
03:49:51,720 --> 03:49:52,860
So like...

5749
03:49:53,580 --> 03:49:57,060
So like that's the roughest part.

5750
03:50:01,400 --> 03:50:03,080
That's the roughest part.

5751
03:50:03,300 --> 03:50:10,060
Because I can only do as much as um...

5752
03:50:10,060 --> 03:50:12,520
I can only have so much of an impact.

5753
03:50:13,680 --> 03:50:15,520
But like it was a good game.

5754
03:50:15,520 --> 03:50:17,380
It was a really really close game.

5755
03:50:17,440 --> 03:50:22,080
I think this was the closest game I've had during the first two.

5756
03:50:24,140 --> 03:50:26,820
So definitely the closest game I've had.

5757
03:50:27,420 --> 03:50:29,020
And uh...

5758
03:50:29,020 --> 03:50:31,700
I had some really insane freezes and stuff.

5759
03:50:32,140 --> 03:50:32,440
There.

5760
03:50:33,280 --> 03:50:35,080
And I got some kills in there too.

5761
03:50:37,020 --> 03:50:39,520
It's just unlucky cause...

5762
03:50:41,600 --> 03:50:45,000
Masayoshi or John Store is really good.

5763
03:50:45,080 --> 03:50:46,960
And the fact that they have two Celestia...

5764
03:50:46,960 --> 03:50:49,120
They have two really good tank players.

5765
03:50:49,720 --> 03:50:54,080
And we had one tank player who doesn't really play tank that often too.

5766
03:50:56,400 --> 03:50:58,060
So it was...

5767
03:50:58,060 --> 03:50:59,400
Yeah, I'm learning a lot.

5768
03:50:59,680 --> 03:51:01,040
I have to get to play roles that...

5769
03:51:01,040 --> 03:51:02,580
Not roles, I'm on support jail.

5770
03:51:03,060 --> 03:51:07,200
LOL Like obviously I shouldn't be playing anything but support.

5771
03:51:07,520 --> 03:51:09,280
No, then my next match is with Sleepy again.

5772
03:51:09,600 --> 03:51:11,160
Obviously I have to play support.

5773
03:51:11,160 --> 03:51:13,360
Because I think if I wasn't on Luna...

5774
03:51:14,160 --> 03:51:17,540
If I wasn't on Luna for my team, it would have been even more rough for my team.

5775
03:51:21,920 --> 03:51:26,620
It would have definitely been more rough for my team at that point.

5776
03:51:26,940 --> 03:51:30,860
If I wasn't freezing the tanks non-stop.

5777
03:51:33,500 --> 03:51:35,160
I fixed the sound.

5778
03:51:36,460 --> 03:51:38,120
Is the sound better or is it worse?

5779
03:51:42,380 --> 03:51:43,660
How's the sound?

5780
03:51:43,800 --> 03:51:45,140
I adjusted the discord again.

5781
03:51:47,600 --> 03:51:49,800
I'm gonna go get more water.

5782
03:51:50,340 --> 03:51:50,680
I'll be back.

5783
03:51:51,160 --> 03:51:53,500
He's gonna be on my team again.

5784
03:51:56,600 --> 03:51:57,720
Boosted up a little higher.

5785
03:51:57,980 --> 03:51:58,840
I'll be right back guys.

5786
03:51:59,780 --> 03:52:00,980
Where the fuck did you post it?

5787
03:52:01,420 --> 03:52:03,020
In this VC's chat.

5788
03:52:05,760 --> 03:52:07,320
In the VC chat?

5789
03:52:07,740 --> 03:52:09,520
You click on the little chat icon on our VC?

5790
03:52:11,680 --> 03:52:12,520
There we go.

5791
03:52:12,560 --> 03:52:12,900
I see it.

5792
03:52:19,030 --> 03:52:19,630
Oh!

5793
03:52:20,470 --> 03:52:20,950
Right?

5794
03:52:21,210 --> 03:52:21,570
Right?

5795
03:52:21,790 --> 03:52:21,990
Right?

5796
03:52:23,390 --> 03:52:24,230
You hear that?

5797
03:52:24,430 --> 03:52:26,370
That's mushroom music.

5798
03:53:35,930 --> 03:53:39,530
My mouth feels so weird because it really sucked.

5799
03:53:40,090 --> 03:53:46,450
Because during the plane ride, there was no soft tissues on the plane.

5800
03:53:46,950 --> 03:53:48,930
So tissues were like super rough.

5801
03:53:49,090 --> 03:53:54,350
So when I was blowing my nose my lips are like the skin is like, you know what I mean?

5802
03:53:54,710 --> 03:54:00,190
Like your skin is like super rough and stuff because I feel like what's the word?

5803
03:54:00,710 --> 03:54:02,710
Like the scratches and stuff.

5804
03:54:03,370 --> 03:54:07,610
So like not the lip like the, yeah.

5805
03:54:07,850 --> 03:54:09,550
I don't know how to describe it.

5806
03:54:09,890 --> 03:54:12,610
So like last night it was like that.

5807
03:54:13,230 --> 03:54:15,710
It's not my lips but it's like the upper area.

5808
03:54:16,210 --> 03:54:18,410
The upper area.

5809
03:54:18,410 --> 03:54:19,190
The rubbed raw.

5810
03:54:19,350 --> 03:54:19,970
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5811
03:54:20,430 --> 03:54:25,490
It's not, like my lips itself aren't chapped, but like it's the bottom and the top part.

5812
03:54:25,830 --> 03:54:27,330
Like the sandpaper, yeah.

5813
03:54:27,610 --> 03:54:34,490
But I had to blow my nose because I was like I had a cold yesterday.

5814
03:54:34,810 --> 03:54:39,590
So yesterday was really bad because it was like super sore because of it.

5815
03:54:39,690 --> 03:54:41,510
But like today it's a lot better.

5816
03:54:42,270 --> 03:54:44,130
Like it's the bottom and the top part.

5817
03:54:44,690 --> 03:54:47,670
And it, oh my gosh, it's been a rough month.

5818
03:54:50,700 --> 03:54:52,860
It's been a rough month.

5819
03:55:02,950 --> 03:55:06,790
Nothing's really been going very well for me.

5820
03:55:09,730 --> 03:55:11,530
Good luck.

5821
03:55:11,950 --> 03:55:12,750
Good luck.

5822
03:55:12,750 --> 03:55:14,310
Good luck, everybody.

5823
03:55:15,010 --> 03:55:15,770
Good luck.

5824
03:55:16,550 --> 03:55:17,450
I hope you win.

5825
03:55:17,990 --> 03:55:18,590
I hope you all lose.

5826
03:55:22,750 --> 03:55:23,930
Except Doki because you're on my team.

5827
03:55:24,110 --> 03:55:25,310
Yeah, I was going to say I'm on your team.

5828
03:55:28,310 --> 03:55:29,630
Fuck you, Sleepy.

5829
03:55:29,770 --> 03:55:31,910
Fuck me, fuck you.

5830
03:55:32,490 --> 03:55:33,050
Fuck you.

5831
03:55:35,050 --> 03:55:35,930
Fuck you.

5832
03:55:38,430 --> 03:55:40,970
Do we have DPS players on our team?

5833
03:55:41,510 --> 03:55:42,750
I'm pretty sure we have five support players.

5834
03:55:42,950 --> 03:55:43,390
Yeah, me too.

5835
03:55:43,450 --> 03:55:44,530
I was like telling my chat.

5836
03:55:44,630 --> 03:55:47,670
I was like, I'm pretty sure this is a five support team.

5837
03:55:48,530 --> 03:55:50,050
I'm with you again.

5838
03:55:50,390 --> 03:55:52,070
Oh, wait, wait, no, no, no, we have a...

5839
03:55:52,070 --> 03:55:54,130
No, Sina is a squirrel one trick player.

5840
03:55:54,450 --> 03:55:56,330
That's why I said five supports.

5841
03:55:57,290 --> 03:55:58,690
Oh, you guys are positive.

5842
03:55:58,990 --> 03:55:59,430
Oh, okay.

5843
03:56:01,850 --> 03:56:02,890
Hey, guys, what's up?

5844
03:56:02,890 --> 03:56:04,710
Good vibes then and here's good vibes.

5845
03:56:05,210 --> 03:56:05,410
Yeah.

5846
03:56:07,310 --> 03:56:08,310
What's up, my boy?

5847
03:56:08,310 --> 03:56:10,370
Yeah, what's up, boy?

5848
03:56:10,690 --> 03:56:12,110
What's up, boy?

5849
03:56:12,190 --> 03:56:13,650
I think I'm the only my boy on the team.

5850
03:56:14,170 --> 03:56:15,250
You're the only guy.

5851
03:56:15,570 --> 03:56:17,070
Does that count?

5852
03:56:17,850 --> 03:56:18,910
Five and a half, I guess.

5853
03:56:20,750 --> 03:56:23,270
We'll all my boy in retaliation, okay?

5854
03:56:23,890 --> 03:56:25,130
Okay, there we go for the vibes.

5855
03:56:25,590 --> 03:56:26,470
Yeah, we will for the vibes.

5856
03:56:26,890 --> 03:56:27,190
My boy!

5857
03:56:28,670 --> 03:56:29,470
Okay, so...

5858
03:56:30,170 --> 03:56:30,830
We're fucked.

5859
03:56:31,050 --> 03:56:32,470
Comp wise...

5860
03:56:32,470 --> 03:56:34,650
I mean, we just have to run triple support.

5861
03:56:35,030 --> 03:56:36,570
But we have zero tank players.

5862
03:56:38,470 --> 03:56:39,530
We have zero tank players.

5863
03:56:39,530 --> 03:56:40,750
We have literally zero tank players.

5864
03:56:40,750 --> 03:56:42,330
But that doesn't help if we don't have a tank player.

5865
03:56:42,530 --> 03:56:43,390
So I think we have a tank.

5866
03:56:43,690 --> 03:56:45,930
Guys, we have to walk in here.

5867
03:56:46,050 --> 03:56:49,450
Because apparently I'm tied for my place.

5868
03:56:49,730 --> 03:56:50,050
For second.

5869
03:56:50,050 --> 03:56:52,890
I'm also tied against the people that we're playing.

5870
03:56:52,970 --> 03:56:53,910
So we have to beat them.

5871
03:56:54,310 --> 03:56:57,330
Well, we hope we have someone that's willing to play tank.

5872
03:56:57,390 --> 03:56:58,950
Because I'd rather just...

5873
03:56:58,950 --> 03:56:59,890
Log off.

5874
03:57:02,150 --> 03:57:02,950
Okay, okay.

5875
03:57:03,190 --> 03:57:06,210
So I think like maybe the strat would be...

5876
03:57:07,950 --> 03:57:12,450
I think that you guys are probably better on heals than I am on heals.

5877
03:57:12,590 --> 03:57:14,050
So then I should play tank.

5878
03:57:14,170 --> 03:57:15,170
And it might be mid.

5879
03:57:16,710 --> 03:57:18,910
But at least the better players...

5880
03:57:18,910 --> 03:57:20,850
Sleepy should 100% play DPS.

5881
03:57:20,990 --> 03:57:21,510
Not gonna lie.

5882
03:57:22,590 --> 03:57:23,090
Oh, okay.

5883
03:57:23,490 --> 03:57:25,510
I can play door.

5884
03:57:28,230 --> 03:57:29,830
Do you need me to play rocket?

5885
03:57:31,350 --> 03:57:32,250
We run rocket.

5886
03:57:32,410 --> 03:57:33,270
We have to have a punish.

5887
03:57:33,270 --> 03:57:35,670
I think you play scroll girl.

5888
03:57:35,790 --> 03:57:36,610
I still need you.

5889
03:57:38,710 --> 03:57:40,510
We just need someone to tank.

5890
03:57:40,510 --> 03:57:41,550
I also want to note.

5891
03:57:42,290 --> 03:57:43,670
We're going against Sykkuno.

5892
03:57:43,930 --> 03:57:46,830
Who is the most annoying player in this entire tournament.

5893
03:57:47,090 --> 03:57:47,490
By far.

5894
03:57:51,070 --> 03:57:52,890
I hate playing against him.

5895
03:57:53,110 --> 03:57:54,910
It's so frustrating.

5896
03:57:54,910 --> 03:57:57,910
He doesn't have the most fucking obscure pocket.

5897
03:57:58,430 --> 03:57:58,910
Magneto.

5898
03:57:59,130 --> 03:58:00,050
Or strange or something.

5899
03:58:01,510 --> 03:58:02,690
Like no one's ever seen it.

5900
03:58:02,770 --> 03:58:03,870
It's never seen the light of day.

5901
03:58:03,950 --> 03:58:05,810
But it's a fucking beast in the night.

5902
03:58:07,090 --> 03:58:08,350
It's not a beast in the night.

5903
03:58:08,390 --> 03:58:10,790
But I think I'm decent at Magneto.

5904
03:58:11,330 --> 03:58:13,410
I'm decent at...

5905
03:58:13,410 --> 03:58:14,290
Penny.

5906
03:58:15,330 --> 03:58:16,910
I can play Groot.

5907
03:58:16,970 --> 03:58:18,010
I wouldn't call it decent.

5908
03:58:19,950 --> 03:58:21,870
And I can play Thor.

5909
03:58:22,550 --> 03:58:23,130
Yeah.

5910
03:58:23,830 --> 03:58:25,870
Who fucking toast?

5911
03:58:26,690 --> 03:58:27,170
It's okay.

5912
03:58:27,310 --> 03:58:30,170
I had three teams.

5913
03:58:30,330 --> 03:58:32,150
That was just all support players.

5914
03:58:32,270 --> 03:58:32,730
It's okay.

5915
03:58:33,490 --> 03:58:34,870
This has been my day.

5916
03:58:40,030 --> 03:58:41,190
I can...

5917
03:58:41,190 --> 03:58:43,930
I can play Magneto.

5918
03:58:44,190 --> 03:58:46,210
I don't know whether I'm the goat.

5919
03:58:46,390 --> 03:58:47,190
I don't think I'm the goat.

5920
03:58:48,170 --> 03:58:49,930
Oh no, they have a tank player.

5921
03:58:49,930 --> 03:58:50,530
Nevermind.

5922
03:58:50,550 --> 03:58:55,250
We have five support players and a squirrel.

5923
03:58:55,470 --> 03:58:56,590
And a squirrel.

5924
03:58:56,910 --> 03:58:58,630
That's basically like...

5925
03:58:58,630 --> 03:59:01,770
What if...

5926
03:59:01,770 --> 03:59:02,990
Yeah, five support.

5927
03:59:03,050 --> 03:59:03,710
And a squirrel.

5928
03:59:05,590 --> 03:59:06,250
Fuck it.

5929
03:59:08,290 --> 03:59:09,790
Guys, you keep me alive.

5930
03:59:09,890 --> 03:59:10,430
I'm a parry.

5931
03:59:11,930 --> 03:59:13,210
I can...

5932
03:59:13,890 --> 03:59:15,290
I can Magneto.

5933
03:59:15,530 --> 03:59:16,570
I think I can Magneto.

5934
03:59:17,530 --> 03:59:18,870
Which one of you has more hours?

5935
03:59:19,090 --> 03:59:19,530
You were said.

5936
03:59:20,470 --> 03:59:21,690
Alright, let's check.

5937
03:59:22,050 --> 03:59:24,190
Okay, how about Sleepy checked that.

5938
03:59:24,890 --> 03:59:28,210
Whichever one of you is a bit more comfortable on tank should play it.

5939
03:59:28,650 --> 03:59:29,330
I'll DPS.

5940
03:59:29,690 --> 03:59:30,910
And we have three supports.

5941
03:59:33,070 --> 03:59:36,110
I can also DPS too if needed.

5942
03:59:36,790 --> 03:59:38,370
My most played tank is Penny.

5943
03:59:38,690 --> 03:59:41,350
But I don't think she's a good solo tank.

5944
03:59:41,850 --> 03:59:42,370
Unless...

5945
03:59:42,370 --> 03:59:43,130
On certain maps.

5946
03:59:43,130 --> 03:59:46,030
It's 100% either Mag or Strange.

5947
03:59:46,790 --> 03:59:48,950
I have 58 minutes on Strange.

5948
03:59:51,710 --> 03:59:53,570
We're so locked in, guys.

5949
03:59:54,750 --> 03:59:56,070
I believe in this.

5950
03:59:56,070 --> 04:00:00,530
I don't have any hours on this account for Magneto.

5951
04:00:00,670 --> 04:00:01,750
But I have played.

5952
04:00:03,150 --> 04:00:04,330
I can play him.

5953
04:00:04,470 --> 04:00:05,150
I think so.

5954
04:00:06,390 --> 04:00:07,950
I can also Magneto.

5955
04:00:08,650 --> 04:00:09,710
I could Magneto.

5956
04:00:09,770 --> 04:00:10,990
I have played a good bit of Magneto.

5957
04:00:10,990 --> 04:00:20,510
What if it's like me and huge mid tanks but the rest of you guys are so good at DPS and support it doesn't matter that we're mid tanks.

5958
04:00:20,870 --> 04:00:21,690
That's true.

5959
04:00:22,090 --> 04:00:25,230
I think that's very possible.

5960
04:00:26,590 --> 04:00:27,870
I'm down to mid tank it up.

5961
04:00:28,110 --> 04:00:32,470
If you know how to survive on Magneto that's good enough.

5962
04:00:32,710 --> 04:00:36,890
I don't need you pumping I will be self-shielding.

5963
04:00:37,710 --> 04:00:38,610
No, I'm kidding.

5964
04:00:39,150 --> 04:00:47,570
If you can just know how to LOS things and use your shield and stuff like that and survive on point it's good enough.

5965
04:00:48,310 --> 04:00:52,950
I don't need faker gameplay Magneto everything.

5966
04:00:54,490 --> 04:00:55,470
I don't think that matters.

5967
04:00:55,550 --> 04:00:58,270
Does that sound more like you or me, Sydney?

5968
04:01:00,210 --> 04:01:04,650
I played Magneto today and my chat might have been glazing me but they said it was really good.

5969
04:01:06,250 --> 04:01:08,570
My chat might be a bunch of glazers.

5970
04:01:08,790 --> 04:01:09,850
Guys, tell me the truth.

5971
04:01:10,330 --> 04:01:11,490
Everyone's looking at you right now.

5972
04:01:11,530 --> 04:01:13,350
Chat, was it good or was it not good?

5973
04:01:13,810 --> 04:01:16,170
I'm throwing it into the fray.

5974
04:01:17,990 --> 04:01:28,930
Honestly, Sydney I trust you with my life with anything so I feel like you probably do have a really solid You know, let's just like if the first round, you know there's something wrong, we can just keep swapping it up.

5975
04:01:29,610 --> 04:01:31,950
Just keep swapping it until it works.

5976
04:01:31,950 --> 04:01:34,750
I can play like strange surely.

5977
04:01:35,210 --> 04:01:38,550
They said, well, they said it was mid.

5978
04:01:40,470 --> 04:01:44,030
But I killed the cloak so that's a double.

5979
04:01:44,050 --> 04:01:44,630
Oh, okay.

5980
04:01:44,770 --> 04:01:46,270
I've never done that in my life.

5981
04:01:47,310 --> 04:01:48,510
Yeah, I didn't do that.

5982
04:01:50,430 --> 04:01:53,590
Okay, so we have five support players and they have five DPS players.

5983
04:01:53,950 --> 04:01:59,430
Okay, I think first game let's try Syd on Mag and then the rest can fill in the blanks.

5984
04:01:59,870 --> 04:02:03,050
I can play DPS too.

5985
04:02:03,330 --> 04:02:04,970
Yeah, if you want to play Scorch, you can play Scorch.

5986
04:02:05,070 --> 04:02:06,510
Or you can play tank, you know.

5987
04:02:06,850 --> 04:02:08,710
You can play support if you want, either one.

5988
04:02:09,790 --> 04:02:10,790
I don't want you to play tank, girl.

5989
04:02:10,850 --> 04:02:11,190
No offense.

5990
04:02:11,310 --> 04:02:11,670
Full offense.

5991
04:02:12,790 --> 04:02:15,390
Can I get an invite, Celine?

5992
04:02:15,770 --> 04:02:16,730
Oh yeah, for sure.

5993
04:02:16,850 --> 04:02:16,990
Sorry.

5994
04:02:17,390 --> 04:02:19,210
I can be like, I can be tank, guys.

5995
04:02:19,530 --> 04:02:19,770
Thank you.

5996
04:02:20,910 --> 04:02:23,330
I can be your hero, babe.

5997
04:02:23,390 --> 04:02:24,310
I can be all those things.

5998
04:02:25,610 --> 04:02:27,910
I literally was just listening to that song.

5999
04:02:27,910 --> 04:02:29,430
I'm glad you could do that.

6000
04:02:29,870 --> 04:02:34,030
I want you to know that's what I listen to whenever I solo queue and then I lose and I turn it off.

6001
04:02:35,110 --> 04:02:35,370
Yeah.

6002
04:02:35,930 --> 04:02:37,870
Did you like that movie, Starstruck?

6003
04:02:38,750 --> 04:02:39,750
What movie is that?

6004
04:02:40,170 --> 04:02:40,830
Is that what it's from?

6005
04:02:41,350 --> 04:02:43,370
I thought that's where it's from.

6006
04:02:44,110 --> 04:02:45,910
Oh, I'm not a movie person.

6007
04:02:46,190 --> 04:02:48,670
I just know that song.

6008
04:02:49,350 --> 04:02:50,870
It's not like Highbrow.

6009
04:02:52,130 --> 04:02:54,270
It's like a Disney Channel movie.

6010
04:02:57,820 --> 04:02:59,180
I'll just kill myself.

6011
04:02:59,300 --> 04:02:59,680
It's fine.

6012
04:02:59,940 --> 04:03:03,900
I can tell what these matches are going to be like, guys.

6013
04:03:06,540 --> 04:03:07,380
It's alright.

6014
04:03:07,600 --> 04:03:14,020
I pretty peaked on that one round I won off of xQc and Shroud.

6015
04:03:14,680 --> 04:03:17,960
That was my highlight for the month.

6016
04:03:18,260 --> 04:03:23,120
For instance, that was the good thing that happened to me this month.

6017
04:03:28,900 --> 04:03:33,240
That was what made everything worth it for this tournament.

6018
04:03:34,020 --> 04:03:35,660
That's what made it worth it.

6019
04:03:36,140 --> 04:03:41,420
Spider-Man and Bucky because Necros on Spider-Man and Bucky is a terror.

6020
04:03:42,480 --> 04:03:44,980
We should ban Spider-Man first.

6021
04:03:45,020 --> 04:03:48,100
Just ban Spider-Man first because he's just going to block us over.

6022
04:03:48,800 --> 04:03:51,060
I think we ban Wolf first.

6023
04:03:51,380 --> 04:03:54,100
I don't think I want to put our solo tank through Wolf.

6024
04:03:54,100 --> 04:03:56,400
If they save Spider-Man, we ban Venom.

6025
04:03:56,520 --> 04:03:57,280
It's not that big of a deal.

6026
04:03:57,720 --> 04:04:00,280
I can play Namor with Luna to counter Spider-Man.

6027
04:04:02,340 --> 04:04:06,140
He played Spider-Man against me earlier when I banned Venom and he just instant swapped when I was on Namor.

6028
04:04:07,860 --> 04:04:09,320
He hates Namor.

6029
04:04:10,220 --> 04:04:12,000
Every Dive character hates Namor.

6030
04:04:12,200 --> 04:04:13,820
Yeah, he hates Namor.

6031
04:04:15,960 --> 04:04:19,120
They're probably going to ban Namor and Loki which kind of sucks.

6032
04:04:20,800 --> 04:04:22,980
You need to target ban Necros.

6033
04:04:23,180 --> 04:04:23,640
Who does he play?

6034
04:04:24,100 --> 04:04:27,580
I don't think Spider-Man is that bad if he doesn't have Venom with him.

6035
04:04:28,960 --> 04:04:30,180
So I think we can just do Venom second.

6036
04:04:30,200 --> 04:04:32,100
Wait, Necros is the number one Spider-Man?

6037
04:04:32,700 --> 04:04:32,900
Yeah.

6038
04:04:35,560 --> 04:04:40,660
To be fair, Spider-Man is considered F tier if you look at the rate.

6039
04:04:41,380 --> 04:04:42,400
To be fair.

6040
04:04:44,780 --> 04:04:46,020
But he makes it work.

6041
04:04:46,040 --> 04:04:48,620
I've seen SK's roll out on Spider-Man and that's scary.

6042
04:04:48,620 --> 04:04:51,000
I love your voice, Doki.

6043
04:04:51,480 --> 04:04:52,220
Oh, thank you.

6044
04:04:52,900 --> 04:04:54,400
Yeah, you have such a cute voice.

6045
04:04:54,560 --> 04:04:55,100
Thank you.

6046
04:04:55,320 --> 04:04:58,000
I'm also sick though so I don't know if it sounds different.

6047
04:04:59,020 --> 04:05:00,420
You sound amazing.

6048
04:05:04,420 --> 04:05:05,540
Are you ready?

6049
04:05:06,800 --> 04:05:07,580
I'm ready!

6050
04:05:10,340 --> 04:05:13,940
Okay guys, don't be afraid to tell me that my Magneto sucks and I need to switch.

6051
04:05:14,160 --> 04:05:15,740
My Magneto fucking sucks and you need to switch.

6052
04:05:15,740 --> 04:05:18,000
Okay, right now we go to our tank player.

6053
04:05:18,120 --> 04:05:18,740
What are you going to do, sleepy?

6054
04:05:19,240 --> 04:05:20,460
Huh, sleepy?

6055
04:05:23,860 --> 04:05:28,620
Do you think Gargura would be proud of you for talking like that?

6056
04:05:28,780 --> 04:05:31,300
I don't think she even knows he exists.

6057
04:05:31,720 --> 04:05:32,320
My boy?

6058
04:05:33,880 --> 04:05:34,840
My boy?

6059
04:05:38,160 --> 04:05:39,280
You know what?

6060
04:05:39,340 --> 04:05:40,360
The vibes are high.

6061
04:05:40,700 --> 04:05:44,720
Even if we lose, we're going to have fun.

6062
04:05:45,020 --> 04:05:48,600
I just got informed to keep my man vibes fucking out of here.

6063
04:05:57,800 --> 04:05:59,960
I'll make up the testosterone here.

6064
04:06:04,000 --> 04:06:05,000
Are you ready?

6065
04:06:05,360 --> 04:06:06,100
I think he's asses.

6066
04:06:07,000 --> 04:06:08,800
I don't know if the enemy team is ready though.

6067
04:06:21,130 --> 04:06:22,110
DPS up.

6068
04:06:22,790 --> 04:06:23,830
She's up.

6069
04:06:24,170 --> 04:06:25,290
And support.

6070
04:06:27,490 --> 04:06:30,490
Yeah, they got tank players.

6071
04:06:30,710 --> 04:06:31,910
They got support players.

6072
04:06:36,010 --> 04:06:36,770
Woah!

6073
04:06:38,430 --> 04:06:38,830
Woah!

6074
04:06:39,910 --> 04:06:41,630
How many games have you won?

6075
04:06:41,630 --> 04:06:43,350
Sleepy, you've won a good amount.

6076
04:06:43,510 --> 04:06:45,010
You've won a good amount, bro.

6077
04:06:48,470 --> 04:06:51,290
Hey guys, I have one point.

6078
04:06:55,150 --> 04:06:59,170
My tier, my ranked tier, they're all tank and DPS players.

6079
04:06:59,310 --> 04:07:01,230
And I'm like the only support in my tier.

6080
04:07:04,290 --> 04:07:07,530
Literally, they put Shroud, John...

6081
04:07:07,530 --> 04:07:09,590
We have our first ban, Wolverine.

6082
04:07:09,730 --> 04:07:10,830
We have our first ban.

6083
04:07:11,110 --> 04:07:11,950
Yeah, we're banning Wolf.

6084
04:07:12,170 --> 04:07:15,250
Yeah, I think it's just like...

6085
04:07:16,110 --> 04:07:17,050
It's just a nightmare.

6086
04:07:17,650 --> 04:07:17,930
In general.

6087
04:07:19,570 --> 04:07:19,590
What?

6088
04:07:22,190 --> 04:07:23,050
Goodbye, Wolf.

6089
04:07:24,170 --> 04:07:25,370
I thought you liked that, Sleepy.

6090
04:07:25,890 --> 04:07:26,170
Nope.

6091
04:07:27,410 --> 04:07:27,850
Sure?

6092
04:07:28,370 --> 04:07:30,190
I'm pretty sure your chat would agree with me.

6093
04:07:30,330 --> 04:07:33,210
I could enjoy it, but like...

6094
04:07:33,670 --> 04:07:34,830
Not so much.

6095
04:07:35,670 --> 04:07:38,050
What do you want to protect if they ban Namor first?

6096
04:07:38,190 --> 04:07:42,230
Sleepy, pay attention!

6097
04:07:42,950 --> 04:07:46,590
What are we protecting if they ban Namor?

6098
04:07:47,150 --> 04:07:48,750
No, then save Spiderman.

6099
04:07:49,930 --> 04:07:50,630
I don't know what to save.

6100
04:07:50,650 --> 04:07:51,390
That's so weird.

6101
04:07:52,890 --> 04:07:54,390
I don't know what to protect.

6102
04:07:55,290 --> 04:07:56,590
I mean, I could protect Loki, but like...

6103
04:07:56,590 --> 04:07:57,450
I'm not really gonna play it.

6104
04:07:57,650 --> 04:07:58,650
Yeah, don't protect Loki.

6105
04:07:58,770 --> 04:07:59,370
There's no point.

6106
04:08:00,510 --> 04:08:01,730
At best, we have Sue.

6107
04:08:01,730 --> 04:08:04,310
If we are getting died too hard, I can just play Sue.

6108
04:08:04,630 --> 04:08:07,130
Should we just protect Magneto?

6109
04:08:07,990 --> 04:08:09,170
Someone click something!

6110
04:08:09,450 --> 04:08:09,690
Luna!

6111
04:08:10,570 --> 04:08:13,230
Oh, yay!

6112
04:08:15,690 --> 04:08:18,730
Alright, we're banning Venom, right?

6113
04:08:19,170 --> 04:08:19,930
Yeah, Venom.

6114
04:08:23,550 --> 04:08:24,390
Guys, sorry.

6115
04:08:24,490 --> 04:08:30,070
Every single time I've played today, we've missed a ban or a protect.

6116
04:08:30,070 --> 04:08:31,130
Like every single time.

6117
04:08:31,210 --> 04:08:33,210
I noticed that.

6118
04:08:33,650 --> 04:08:35,050
You know what I noticed?

6119
04:08:35,110 --> 04:08:37,850
The first time it happened, I was like, was that on purpose?

6120
04:08:38,210 --> 04:08:39,250
Guys, you know what I noticed?

6121
04:08:39,750 --> 04:08:41,710
Toast has the most points in his tier.

6122
04:08:41,850 --> 04:08:42,930
I think he's rigging.

6123
04:08:43,150 --> 04:08:45,310
I think he's rigging his matches.

6124
04:08:46,090 --> 04:08:46,710
I'm pretty.

6125
04:08:47,610 --> 04:08:50,830
He wants to win all the skins for himself.

6126
04:08:52,990 --> 04:08:54,070
Wait, so we're going...

6127
04:08:55,530 --> 04:08:56,670
What are we going again?

6128
04:08:58,270 --> 04:09:01,750
I think we're going triple support and then Sleepy wanted DPS.

6129
04:09:02,010 --> 04:09:03,150
You wanted DPS?

6130
04:09:03,650 --> 04:09:05,270
Alright, sounds good.

6131
04:09:05,710 --> 04:09:07,610
Loki, do you have a support you prefer?

6132
04:09:07,950 --> 04:09:08,890
I can play any support.

6133
04:09:09,450 --> 04:09:11,290
Do you want me on Cloak and Dagger?

6134
04:09:11,550 --> 04:09:15,670
I do think if you have the fucking dirtiest Daniel Loki, Loki's good.

6135
04:09:15,990 --> 04:09:16,770
I'm going to ban it.

6136
04:09:16,830 --> 04:09:18,490
You are not paying attention!

6137
04:09:19,970 --> 04:09:20,550
They banned it.

6138
04:09:20,750 --> 04:09:23,010
Should I D&D?

6139
04:09:23,410 --> 04:09:24,070
You should Cloak it.

6140
04:09:24,110 --> 04:09:25,130
Cloak and Dagger is so good.

6141
04:09:25,130 --> 04:09:27,330
Cloak and Dagger is so good.

6142
04:09:28,050 --> 04:09:33,330
At best if we get died by Spider-Man, keep your push for Spider-Man.

6143
04:09:34,710 --> 04:09:37,050
What are our thoughts about 2-2-2?

6144
04:09:38,890 --> 04:09:40,770
2-2-2...

6145
04:09:40,770 --> 04:09:43,130
I can try...

6146
04:09:44,730 --> 04:09:47,410
Oh, I can do...

6147
04:09:47,410 --> 04:09:47,690
Penny.

6148
04:09:48,570 --> 04:09:50,030
I can also do Penny.

6149
04:09:51,370 --> 04:09:52,790
Alright, let's try this first.

6150
04:09:52,790 --> 04:09:54,490
Okay, shall we go left?

6151
04:09:55,110 --> 04:09:55,590
Yeah.

6152
04:09:56,050 --> 04:09:59,350
Okay, I'm the tank.

6153
04:09:59,890 --> 04:10:00,450
I believe.

6154
04:10:00,930 --> 04:10:01,730
I'll put...

6155
04:10:02,370 --> 04:10:04,150
Oh my god, there's a Spider-Man!

6156
04:10:04,410 --> 04:10:05,430
Why are you guys all here?

6157
04:10:05,870 --> 04:10:07,450
Wait, what?

6158
04:10:08,990 --> 04:10:10,670
You guys split up.

6159
04:10:14,770 --> 04:10:16,410
The Spider-Man is just going to...

6160
04:10:16,410 --> 04:10:18,610
The Spider-Man is just going to camp.

6161
04:10:19,110 --> 04:10:20,940
We should make sure...

6162
04:10:20,940 --> 04:10:22,860
Yep, there he is.

6163
04:10:23,100 --> 04:10:23,280
Push?

6164
04:10:23,400 --> 04:10:23,880
Yeah, push.

6165
04:10:24,300 --> 04:10:26,700
We can go through the stairs.

6166
04:10:27,180 --> 04:10:28,640
Yeah, let's go through the stairs.

6167
04:10:28,920 --> 04:10:29,840
Come through the left.

6168
04:10:30,340 --> 04:10:31,580
I'm upstairs now.

6169
04:10:32,500 --> 04:10:33,580
Spider-Man is low.

6170
04:10:33,820 --> 04:10:35,160
He's looking for a health pack.

6171
04:10:37,300 --> 04:10:39,040
Karrison, Spider-Man is behind you.

6172
04:10:39,180 --> 04:10:39,740
Thank you.

6173
04:10:40,360 --> 04:10:41,180
I'm trying.

6174
04:10:41,360 --> 04:10:41,620
I'm trying.

6175
04:10:41,740 --> 04:10:42,140
I'm shooting you.

6176
04:10:43,780 --> 04:10:44,480
Oh my god.

6177
04:10:45,020 --> 04:10:45,800
I'm frozen.

6178
04:10:46,520 --> 04:10:47,200
Oh, wait.

6179
04:10:47,200 --> 04:10:47,680
Thanks.

6180
04:10:48,560 --> 04:10:51,200
I have no idea why I targeted that, but...

6181
04:10:51,800 --> 04:10:52,160
I'm pushing here.

6182
04:10:52,520 --> 04:10:53,960
Yep, yep, yep.

6183
04:10:56,320 --> 04:10:57,080
We're up one.

6184
04:10:57,800 --> 04:10:58,500
Tank can drop.

6185
04:10:58,780 --> 04:10:59,280
Tank can fall.

6186
04:10:59,660 --> 04:11:01,140
I'm looking at the supports.

6187
04:11:01,320 --> 04:11:02,380
I'm looking at Pacuno.

6188
04:11:02,860 --> 04:11:03,340
Dead.

6189
04:11:05,360 --> 04:11:06,080
I'm frozen.

6190
04:11:07,060 --> 04:11:08,020
Any heals?

6191
04:11:08,900 --> 04:11:09,560
I'm dead.

6192
04:11:09,760 --> 04:11:09,880
I'm dead.

6193
04:11:10,020 --> 04:11:10,180
I'm dead.

6194
04:11:11,820 --> 04:11:12,740
Oh, I'm going to die to...

6195
04:11:12,740 --> 04:11:13,400
Oh my god.

6196
04:11:14,280 --> 04:11:15,160
We can win this.

6197
04:11:15,320 --> 04:11:15,680
You're even.

6198
04:11:15,880 --> 04:11:16,220
You're even.

6199
04:11:17,600 --> 04:11:18,320
Max one.

6200
04:11:18,760 --> 04:11:20,100
You have no supports though.

6201
04:11:21,260 --> 04:11:22,060
I'm going to die though.

6202
04:11:22,160 --> 04:11:22,420
It's all you.

6203
04:11:22,560 --> 04:11:23,200
It's all you.

6204
04:11:23,300 --> 04:11:23,580
It's all you.

6205
04:11:26,820 --> 04:11:27,180
Okay.

6206
04:11:27,540 --> 04:11:28,860
Support, let's all stay...

6207
04:11:28,860 --> 04:11:30,020
We all have to stay together.

6208
04:11:31,360 --> 04:11:32,660
We can't split up.

6209
04:11:34,220 --> 04:11:34,580
Because...

6210
04:11:35,340 --> 04:11:37,400
Yeah, because when the Spider-Man died me...

6211
04:11:38,720 --> 04:11:39,440
We all...

6212
04:11:39,440 --> 04:11:41,400
The other supports were...

6213
04:11:41,400 --> 04:11:43,180
The other supports were in front of me.

6214
04:11:43,240 --> 04:11:45,340
So I need everybody to group up here.

6215
04:11:46,980 --> 04:11:47,480
Same thing.

6216
04:11:47,540 --> 04:11:48,140
We just go through top.

6217
04:11:49,100 --> 04:11:50,220
Okay, we all group up together.

6218
04:11:52,140 --> 04:11:53,160
We all wait for a tank.

6219
04:11:54,720 --> 04:11:55,440
I'm running.

6220
04:11:57,820 --> 04:11:58,540
I'm coming.

6221
04:11:58,880 --> 04:11:59,260
Alright, here we go.

6222
04:11:59,540 --> 04:11:59,560
Okay.

6223
04:12:00,900 --> 04:12:02,160
Fuck you, Spider-Man.

6224
04:12:03,920 --> 04:12:04,760
They're going to have Spider-Man ult.

6225
04:12:04,760 --> 04:12:06,020
I'm just going to hear the Spider-Man, please.

6226
04:12:07,580 --> 04:12:08,700
I pushed him away.

6227
04:12:08,700 --> 04:12:09,240
Nice.

6228
04:12:09,620 --> 04:12:10,860
We can kill him.

6229
04:12:11,880 --> 04:12:13,060
Go up.

6230
04:12:13,560 --> 04:12:15,220
Drop point.

6231
04:12:15,500 --> 04:12:16,980
Help Sleepy.

6232
04:12:17,760 --> 04:12:20,080
I didn't realize he...

6233
04:12:20,080 --> 04:12:21,380
Support all you needed.

6234
04:12:22,860 --> 04:12:23,760
I'm ulting.

6235
04:12:24,600 --> 04:12:26,340
Protect our supports.

6236
04:12:26,560 --> 04:12:26,980
Protect our supports.

6237
04:12:28,560 --> 04:12:29,780
I'm ulting for you.

6238
04:12:30,560 --> 04:12:32,080
We have my ult.

6239
04:12:32,700 --> 04:12:33,480
They ulted as well.

6240
04:12:35,220 --> 04:12:36,080
I know.

6241
04:12:36,080 --> 04:12:37,020
I'm using it now.

6242
04:12:38,440 --> 04:12:39,740
I have to run back.

6243
04:12:41,480 --> 04:12:42,640
I'm damaged boosting.

6244
04:12:42,920 --> 04:12:43,180
I got you.

6245
04:12:43,720 --> 04:12:44,300
I'm shielding you.

6246
04:12:44,380 --> 04:12:45,200
I have you, Sleepy.

6247
04:12:45,300 --> 04:12:46,240
I'm damaged boosting.

6248
04:12:46,900 --> 04:12:48,620
3, 2, 1.

6249
04:12:48,780 --> 04:12:50,900
I got him.

6250
04:12:51,020 --> 04:12:52,860
I got him.

6251
04:12:53,240 --> 04:12:54,540
Kill him fast.

6252
04:12:56,420 --> 04:12:57,780
Yeah, you can.

6253
04:12:58,500 --> 04:12:59,060
Huge ult.

6254
04:13:00,720 --> 04:13:02,800
The Punisher can destroy the ult.

6255
04:13:02,900 --> 04:13:03,400
It pops fast.

6256
04:13:03,400 --> 04:13:04,520
It's fine.

6257
04:13:04,600 --> 04:13:05,200
Push up.

6258
04:13:06,120 --> 04:13:08,100
I can kill.

6259
04:13:09,540 --> 04:13:10,100
Push up.

6260
04:13:10,620 --> 04:13:11,820
I got you.

6261
04:13:12,100 --> 04:13:13,920
We have each other.

6262
04:13:14,160 --> 04:13:14,920
I got you.

6263
04:13:16,280 --> 04:13:18,080
I'm shielding you.

6264
04:13:19,340 --> 04:13:20,980
I'm pushing him away.

6265
04:13:21,200 --> 04:13:21,680
Nice bubble.

6266
04:13:22,200 --> 04:13:23,760
I don't have anything.

6267
04:13:31,980 --> 04:13:33,760
That was our last fight.

6268
04:13:34,540 --> 04:13:35,280
We might...

6269
04:13:35,280 --> 04:13:37,380
If someone can swap to Strange right now and the TP.

6270
04:13:42,400 --> 04:13:43,520
It's a little slow.

6271
04:13:43,660 --> 04:13:45,500
I don't think we're going to be able to do this.

6272
04:13:46,060 --> 04:13:46,540
Oh god.

6273
04:13:48,360 --> 04:13:49,520
You got this.

6274
04:13:51,520 --> 04:13:52,400
Jump in.

6275
04:13:52,540 --> 04:13:53,320
Jump in.

6276
04:13:53,800 --> 04:13:54,260
You did it.

6277
04:13:54,520 --> 04:13:54,860
What?

6278
04:13:56,920 --> 04:13:58,240
Where did the point go?

6279
04:13:58,240 --> 04:13:58,860
I swapped.

6280
04:14:00,300 --> 04:14:00,960
Okay.

6281
04:14:01,940 --> 04:14:03,520
You jumped right in.

6282
04:14:08,040 --> 04:14:11,420
I'm shielding you again.

6283
04:14:12,360 --> 04:14:13,600
I'm trying.

6284
04:14:14,280 --> 04:14:15,480
It's okay.

6285
04:14:15,980 --> 04:14:16,940
I tried.

6286
04:14:18,340 --> 04:14:19,540
MT everybody.

6287
04:14:20,300 --> 04:14:24,860
We got 60%.

6288
04:14:24,860 --> 04:14:25,280
I hate this.

6289
04:14:26,160 --> 04:14:26,640
Guys.

6290
04:14:27,660 --> 04:14:29,020
I'm that Spider-Man.

6291
04:14:29,200 --> 04:14:29,740
I hate it.

6292
04:14:29,780 --> 04:14:31,440
We can just ban.

6293
04:14:33,320 --> 04:14:36,180
I'm willing to go...

6294
04:14:36,840 --> 04:14:37,620
Second tank.

6295
04:14:38,000 --> 04:14:39,940
I think Penny would be sick here.

6296
04:14:40,060 --> 04:14:41,500
Honestly with their team comp.

6297
04:14:45,390 --> 04:14:45,750
Alright.

6298
04:14:45,810 --> 04:14:47,130
Let's do it to them, guys.

6299
04:14:47,670 --> 04:14:48,550
Now I know.

6300
04:14:48,630 --> 04:14:50,630
When I swap off of Strange, the portal disappears.

6301
04:14:51,050 --> 04:14:51,530
No.

6302
04:14:52,090 --> 04:14:52,630
No.

6303
04:14:52,710 --> 04:14:55,970
You could have stayed on tank.

6304
04:14:56,170 --> 04:14:56,730
It was fine.

6305
04:14:57,470 --> 04:14:57,670
Yeah.

6306
04:14:58,050 --> 04:15:00,330
It was last-ditch effort.

6307
04:15:01,570 --> 04:15:04,030
It was more so you don't swap off.

6308
04:15:04,290 --> 04:15:05,570
I've never done that before.

6309
04:15:06,770 --> 04:15:08,610
You got that portal.

6310
04:15:09,010 --> 04:15:11,670
That's a high level play you did there.

6311
04:15:11,870 --> 04:15:12,670
You've learned something.

6312
04:15:14,150 --> 04:15:16,010
People do that in competitive.

6313
04:15:18,190 --> 04:15:21,340
Guys, I've been doing cardio simulator this entire round.

6314
04:15:21,520 --> 04:15:22,900
I don't even know what...

6315
04:15:22,900 --> 04:15:24,160
They don't...

6316
04:15:24,160 --> 04:15:26,000
They don't Strange, right?

6317
04:15:26,500 --> 04:15:28,060
Can I play DPS next round?

6318
04:15:28,340 --> 04:15:29,860
I just want one round of DPS.

6319
04:15:34,240 --> 04:15:36,160
I'm not gonna lie.

6320
04:15:36,560 --> 04:15:38,260
I don't think Wolverine is...

6321
04:15:38,260 --> 04:15:40,980
I think you guys might be getting the better of the treatment here.

6322
04:15:41,180 --> 04:15:42,800
If he goes BP, it's gonna be a rough day.

6323
04:15:43,900 --> 04:15:44,240
Yeah.

6324
04:15:44,900 --> 04:15:46,860
So we ban Spider-Man and he goes BP.

6325
04:15:46,860 --> 04:15:49,080
He will always get Namor first, huh?

6326
04:15:49,200 --> 04:15:50,000
But I can...

6327
04:15:51,420 --> 04:15:52,860
There's Nerf Graves coming in.

6328
04:15:53,140 --> 04:15:53,580
I see him.

6329
04:15:54,820 --> 04:15:55,980
Yeah, he's low.

6330
04:15:56,660 --> 04:15:57,880
He needs this.

6331
04:15:57,940 --> 04:15:59,440
He had to rush Twitch Rivals, guys.

6332
04:15:59,980 --> 04:16:02,560
His Twitch Rivals was really rough.

6333
04:16:02,720 --> 04:16:02,960
Haha!

6334
04:16:04,020 --> 04:16:05,100
Oh, is he already here?

6335
04:16:05,980 --> 04:16:08,100
It's called the Spider-Man rollout.

6336
04:16:08,120 --> 04:16:08,640
I'm trying, Doki.

6337
04:16:09,660 --> 04:16:10,400
It's fine.

6338
04:16:10,580 --> 04:16:11,300
I'm okay.

6339
04:16:11,300 --> 04:16:11,440
Okay.

6340
04:16:16,290 --> 04:16:17,290
Oh, god.

6341
04:16:19,950 --> 04:16:20,690
Fuck you, Cuck.

6342
04:16:21,150 --> 04:16:21,750
I need you in the back.

6343
04:16:22,430 --> 04:16:23,230
I'm with you.

6344
04:16:26,070 --> 04:16:27,050
Okay, punish your turret.

6345
04:16:27,070 --> 04:16:29,170
Just cover the Spider-Man in the back.

6346
04:16:29,350 --> 04:16:30,130
Yep, he's here.

6347
04:16:31,230 --> 04:16:31,770
I broke the turret.

6348
04:16:31,950 --> 04:16:33,130
I got you.

6349
04:16:35,310 --> 04:16:36,850
But you have to get me, too.

6350
04:16:36,890 --> 04:16:37,470
Oh, fuck.

6351
04:16:37,550 --> 04:16:37,830
I'm dead.

6352
04:16:39,490 --> 04:16:40,330
I have you.

6353
04:16:40,330 --> 04:16:41,490
I have you.

6354
04:16:44,230 --> 04:16:45,590
Oh, god.

6355
04:16:49,500 --> 04:16:50,600
I just froze Spider-Man.

6356
04:16:50,700 --> 04:16:51,320
You can kill him.

6357
04:16:51,580 --> 04:16:53,700
Oh, there he came back.

6358
04:16:54,400 --> 04:16:55,320
Oh, god.

6359
04:16:55,560 --> 04:16:56,160
It's fine.

6360
04:16:56,940 --> 04:16:58,100
It's so good.

6361
04:16:58,560 --> 04:16:59,640
It's fine.

6362
04:17:00,700 --> 04:17:03,300
Oh, fuck Spider-Man.

6363
04:17:03,900 --> 04:17:04,640
Spider-Man.

6364
04:17:05,160 --> 04:17:06,120
Hey, NG, guys.

6365
04:17:07,320 --> 04:17:08,680
Oh, my god.

6366
04:17:11,700 --> 04:17:12,980
Oh, fuck Spider-Man.

6367
04:17:13,600 --> 04:17:15,580
Yay, I get to play DPS.

6368
04:17:16,120 --> 04:17:17,660
You play DPS.

6369
04:17:17,920 --> 04:17:18,780
You deserve it.

6370
04:17:18,960 --> 04:17:20,000
I deserve it.

6371
04:17:24,300 --> 04:17:25,080
You're right.

6372
04:17:25,160 --> 04:17:31,600
If I kill him on DPS, I'm gonna make a clickbait video and be like, Necros dies to a support player on DPS.

6373
04:17:42,510 --> 04:17:43,530
Is that our last one?

6374
04:17:43,530 --> 04:17:44,670
No, we didn't win.

6375
04:17:44,790 --> 04:17:47,610
Our next one is our last one.

6376
04:17:48,870 --> 04:17:52,890
I've been playing Rivals for so long, my brain is foggy.

6377
04:17:53,030 --> 04:17:54,250
It feels like pudding up there.

6378
04:17:56,190 --> 04:17:58,210
Oh, so what is our lineup gonna be?

6379
04:18:00,510 --> 04:18:07,050
I guess you and Cinna on DPS and then we...

6380
04:18:07,050 --> 04:18:08,790
You guys want a 2-2-2?

6381
04:18:09,750 --> 04:18:11,410
I'm down for 2-2-2.

6382
04:18:11,410 --> 04:18:12,430
1-3-2?

6383
04:18:12,810 --> 04:18:14,390
Or 1-2-3?

6384
04:18:15,190 --> 04:18:18,010
Actually, I'm also down for 2-1-3.

6385
04:18:18,510 --> 04:18:19,850
Or a 2-1-3?

6386
04:18:20,310 --> 04:18:20,590
Yeah.

6387
04:18:22,930 --> 04:18:26,190
Wait, but we can't 2-1-3 if Doki is DPSing.

6388
04:18:27,330 --> 04:18:29,230
This is my last hurrah.

6389
04:18:30,650 --> 04:18:32,470
My last hurrah.

6390
04:18:32,610 --> 04:18:34,550
I was on support Jill for so long.

6391
04:18:35,050 --> 04:18:37,650
I can 1...

6392
04:18:37,650 --> 04:18:39,310
We can 1-2-3.

6393
04:18:41,410 --> 04:18:42,710
Yeah, we can 1-2-3.

6394
04:18:42,890 --> 04:18:44,770
Are we selecting the map or are they selecting the map?

6395
04:18:45,090 --> 04:18:46,590
They're selecting it.

6396
04:18:46,650 --> 04:18:47,930
Okay, I'll just be like, ready.

6397
04:18:49,450 --> 04:18:53,430
I can try solo tanking.

6398
04:18:55,270 --> 04:18:55,950
I'm down.

6399
04:18:56,050 --> 04:18:57,050
I'm down for whatever.

6400
04:19:01,210 --> 04:19:06,050
I will just say it when I'm going up and then leave it to your guys' hands.

6401
04:19:06,330 --> 04:19:07,490
Wait, we pick the map?

6402
04:19:07,670 --> 04:19:08,410
Sleepy, what map?

6403
04:19:08,970 --> 04:19:10,370
I just do Koth, get it over with.

6404
04:19:11,290 --> 04:19:13,310
Any Koth map.

6405
04:19:14,870 --> 04:19:15,890
Just let him pick.

6406
04:19:16,310 --> 04:19:17,930
Choose your best rollout.

6407
04:19:18,170 --> 04:19:19,690
No preference.

6408
04:19:20,450 --> 04:19:22,230
So then we just ban Spidey off rip.

6409
04:19:24,090 --> 04:19:30,270
Yeah, he'll be like, I'm going to choose my best Spiderman rollout map and then we ban Spiderman.

6410
04:19:35,090 --> 04:19:36,750
Wait, he chose this map?

6411
04:19:37,010 --> 04:19:38,510
His team got knocked out on that map.

6412
04:19:38,510 --> 04:19:38,950
I know.

6413
04:19:39,390 --> 04:19:42,590
Who did he lose to?

6414
04:19:43,030 --> 04:19:43,950
How has he lost?

6415
04:19:44,990 --> 04:19:45,790
Oh, you did?

6416
04:19:47,510 --> 04:19:48,370
Must be nice.

6417
04:19:49,810 --> 04:19:52,870
But then he just starts target banning me every fucking time and I can't beat him anymore.

6418
04:19:57,150 --> 04:19:58,970
Every fucking time ever since then.

6419
04:19:59,790 --> 04:20:01,230
That's smart though.

6420
04:20:01,230 --> 04:20:03,150
You guys want to play Psylocke?

6421
04:20:04,270 --> 04:20:05,570
Am I hitting Mag?

6422
04:20:06,290 --> 04:20:09,070
I think Eugene was down to solo Mag.

6423
04:20:09,410 --> 04:20:09,690
Yeah.

6424
04:20:10,570 --> 04:20:13,050
Does that put me on DPS or heals?

6425
04:20:13,050 --> 04:20:14,110
I can also play tank.

6426
04:20:15,050 --> 04:20:20,850
I'm going to feed so fucking hard.

6427
04:20:20,950 --> 04:20:21,810
I'm sorry guys.

6428
04:20:24,450 --> 04:20:27,270
I haven't played Psylocke in so long.

6429
04:20:27,690 --> 04:20:28,310
Sleepy, ban.

6430
04:20:29,410 --> 04:20:30,150
Where's Spiderman?

6431
04:20:32,510 --> 04:20:33,570
Oh my god.

6432
04:20:33,710 --> 04:20:36,310
I was going to be like, after all that...

6433
04:20:37,190 --> 04:20:38,190
Where's Spiderman?

6434
04:20:42,090 --> 04:20:43,770
I'm going to ban Namor.

6435
04:20:43,770 --> 04:20:45,130
Do we ban BP then?

6436
04:20:46,090 --> 04:20:47,370
I'm down to ban BP.

6437
04:20:47,370 --> 04:20:49,890
He wants to have fun.

6438
04:20:52,250 --> 04:20:53,690
I'm going to ban Namor.

6439
04:20:54,750 --> 04:20:55,610
Wait, who am I saving?

6440
04:20:55,610 --> 04:20:58,010
Why don't we just save Loki then?

6441
04:21:00,550 --> 04:21:02,530
Let's save Loki and ban BP.

6442
04:21:03,790 --> 04:21:06,330
At least you guys can have some fun.

6443
04:21:08,910 --> 04:21:11,030
Alright, ban BP, right?

6444
04:21:12,590 --> 04:21:14,290
Yeah, no dive heroes for you.

6445
04:21:14,690 --> 04:21:15,470
Unless he plays Ironfist.

6446
04:21:15,470 --> 04:21:17,290
He plays Ironfist too, by the way.

6447
04:21:17,450 --> 04:21:19,770
Yeah, I was about to say, he thirds Ironfist.

6448
04:21:19,810 --> 04:21:20,550
Yeah, his sister.

6449
04:21:20,970 --> 04:21:22,130
You know what?

6450
04:21:22,910 --> 04:21:23,690
Actually, no.

6451
04:21:23,830 --> 04:21:26,470
I feel like BP is easier to shut down versus Ironfist.

6452
04:21:27,710 --> 04:21:29,750
Yeah, Ironfist has damage mitigation.

6453
04:21:31,010 --> 04:21:31,790
Oh, yeah.

6454
04:21:32,070 --> 04:21:32,450
No doubt.

6455
04:21:32,670 --> 04:21:34,510
You can't push him away.

6456
04:21:35,550 --> 04:21:36,950
Yeah, can't push him away.

6457
04:21:41,830 --> 04:21:45,110
Honestly, Sleepy, I think you should play Loki and just...

6458
04:21:45,110 --> 04:21:45,910
Yeah.

6459
04:21:48,330 --> 04:21:49,950
I think this is good.

6460
04:21:49,950 --> 04:21:51,590
Do you want Luna or Mantis?

6461
04:21:51,950 --> 04:21:52,890
Your preference.

6462
04:21:53,290 --> 04:21:57,330
Are you better at freezing?

6463
04:21:57,930 --> 04:21:59,350
Are you better at freezing or sleeping?

6464
04:21:59,850 --> 04:22:00,370
That's the thing.

6465
04:22:02,050 --> 04:22:02,610
Sleeping.

6466
04:22:03,570 --> 04:22:05,970
Because you gotta sleep the Wolverine every time.

6467
04:22:06,190 --> 04:22:07,510
So like...

6468
04:22:07,510 --> 04:22:09,790
Not every time, but it's your job now.

6469
04:22:15,050 --> 04:22:17,590
I knew I was done after the first game.

6470
04:22:20,430 --> 04:22:21,630
Necro's probably...

6471
04:22:21,630 --> 04:22:26,930
He doesn't even need this.

6472
04:22:27,690 --> 04:22:29,090
He doesn't even need this.

6473
04:22:30,890 --> 04:22:32,650
Because his team needs it.

6474
04:22:34,250 --> 04:22:36,430
His team don't need it either.

6475
04:22:36,670 --> 04:22:37,470
I feel like.

6476
04:22:38,250 --> 04:22:41,070
Necro, you're literally partnered with rivals.

6477
04:22:41,190 --> 04:22:42,450
You can get any skin you want.

6478
04:22:43,610 --> 04:22:44,570
Wait, he's partnered?

6479
04:22:44,750 --> 04:22:47,190
He personally knows the devs.

6480
04:22:47,190 --> 04:22:48,830
He really doesn't need this.

6481
04:22:48,910 --> 04:22:50,610
He personally knows the devs too.

6482
04:22:50,730 --> 04:22:52,970
So it's like, you don't even need the skins.

6483
04:22:56,950 --> 04:22:58,910
At least our vibes are good.

6484
04:22:58,970 --> 04:23:01,170
I've never been sponsored by Marvel Rivals.

6485
04:23:01,430 --> 04:23:02,150
I need this.

6486
04:23:03,470 --> 04:23:04,450
He's on Iron Fist.

6487
04:23:05,830 --> 04:23:07,130
Supports stick together.

6488
04:23:07,910 --> 04:23:08,730
Hold hands, everyone.

6489
04:23:10,790 --> 04:23:14,150
Okay, you're walled off.

6490
04:23:14,150 --> 04:23:14,710
He's lurking.

6491
04:23:14,850 --> 04:23:15,730
I know he is.

6492
04:23:17,470 --> 04:23:18,550
He's asleep.

6493
04:23:24,610 --> 04:23:32,930
Oh my god, they're so low though.

6494
04:23:35,630 --> 04:23:36,770
Oh my god,

6495
04:23:40,650 --> 04:23:41,490
they're so low.

6496
04:23:44,150 --> 04:23:45,390
The crew was so low.

6497
04:23:45,750 --> 04:23:47,670
I can ult after this.

6498
04:23:48,110 --> 04:23:48,730
We're doing this.

6499
04:23:54,610 --> 04:24:02,370
I have ult here, but I think they have...

6500
04:24:03,230 --> 04:24:05,450
Yeah, they used one of them.

6501
04:24:05,590 --> 04:24:06,270
I can ult them.

6502
04:24:08,630 --> 04:24:09,770
Yeah, I'm pushing up now.

6503
04:24:10,210 --> 04:24:11,470
I'm flanking them.

6504
04:24:14,150 --> 04:24:16,610
I'm gonna ult them as soon as I see a support player.

6505
04:24:19,110 --> 04:24:21,950
Yeah, I got the Luna ult out.

6506
04:24:23,830 --> 04:24:25,350
I couldn't live there.

6507
04:24:26,830 --> 04:24:28,470
I have ulti soon.

6508
04:24:29,950 --> 04:24:31,370
They don't have support ults.

6509
04:24:32,010 --> 04:24:32,770
Yeah, I'm ulting.

6510
04:24:38,250 --> 04:24:40,850
Oh my god, the Mantis ult actually saved me.

6511
04:24:44,150 --> 04:24:44,470
I'm still alive.

6512
04:24:52,190 --> 04:24:55,790
I'm blocking this Luna.

6513
04:24:56,230 --> 04:24:57,390
She's shifting.

6514
04:24:57,990 --> 04:25:01,530
Oh my god, we got the point.

6515
04:25:01,650 --> 04:25:02,130
Let's go.

6516
04:25:05,110 --> 04:25:06,710
Let's fucking go.

6517
04:25:06,830 --> 04:25:09,850
I'm gonna walk up a little bit.

6518
04:25:14,630 --> 04:25:20,750
I got him half.

6519
04:25:20,890 --> 04:25:21,130
He's half.

6520
04:25:21,190 --> 04:25:22,410
I'm here.

6521
04:25:22,730 --> 04:25:23,850
I'm back on point.

6522
04:25:24,190 --> 04:25:26,090
I don't want to get iron fisted.

6523
04:25:28,310 --> 04:25:30,470
Wait, their grid is so low.

6524
04:25:31,990 --> 04:25:33,450
I can match.

6525
04:25:33,730 --> 04:25:34,450
I blinded them.

6526
04:25:35,110 --> 04:25:36,650
I'll ult after this.

6527
04:25:36,830 --> 04:25:38,330
Everyone point.

6528
04:25:38,750 --> 04:25:40,850
Stay in my ult.

6529
04:25:44,690 --> 04:25:45,210
Necro's.

6530
04:25:46,330 --> 04:25:47,390
You guys are okay.

6531
04:25:47,530 --> 04:25:49,350
You guys are okay.

6532
04:25:50,470 --> 04:25:51,810
I got the Luna ult out.

6533
04:25:52,930 --> 04:25:53,690
Okay, I'm easy.

6534
04:25:58,030 --> 04:25:59,250
I can go.

6535
04:26:00,490 --> 04:26:01,330
Just stay on point.

6536
04:26:01,430 --> 04:26:01,710
Fight on point.

6537
04:26:02,670 --> 04:26:03,410
I'm on grid.

6538
04:26:03,850 --> 04:26:04,250
Grid's one.

6539
04:26:05,710 --> 04:26:07,390
Oh, they're so low.

6540
04:26:08,230 --> 04:26:09,370
I'm coming back.

6541
04:26:09,810 --> 04:26:10,690
Oh my god.

6542
04:26:11,330 --> 04:26:12,190
Play on point.

6543
04:26:12,870 --> 04:26:14,690
I got Wolverine.

6544
04:26:23,030 --> 04:26:24,530
I got Luna.

6545
04:26:26,670 --> 04:26:28,270
I couldn't get out of shift.

6546
04:26:30,310 --> 04:26:31,750
Just fight on point.

6547
04:26:34,030 --> 04:26:35,070
Don't leave point.

6548
04:26:35,270 --> 04:26:35,730
Don't leave point.

6549
04:26:35,890 --> 04:26:36,410
We're ulting.

6550
04:26:36,410 --> 04:26:36,670
We're ulting.

6551
04:26:38,950 --> 04:26:40,010
I have ult soon.

6552
04:26:41,690 --> 04:26:44,750
Just keep fighting on point.

6553
04:26:44,890 --> 04:26:46,130
We don't give up cap.

6554
04:26:50,350 --> 04:26:51,710
I'm on it.

6555
04:26:56,850 --> 04:26:59,130
I got the Luna ult out.

6556
04:26:59,370 --> 04:27:00,230
Just stay on point.

6557
04:27:00,610 --> 04:27:01,470
I need help.

6558
04:27:02,050 --> 04:27:03,610
I'm running back.

6559
04:27:03,610 --> 04:27:04,230
Oh shit.

6560
04:27:05,530 --> 04:27:06,750
We have one fight.

6561
04:27:08,930 --> 04:27:10,650
I can touch if needed.

6562
04:27:11,750 --> 04:27:14,530
Hey, you know what guys?

6563
04:27:14,590 --> 04:27:15,670
I'm proud of us right now.

6564
04:27:17,170 --> 04:27:17,970
I can touch.

6565
04:27:18,170 --> 04:27:20,410
Thank you.

6566
04:27:23,050 --> 04:27:24,630
I'm on it now.

6567
04:27:25,010 --> 04:27:26,230
I had to.

6568
04:27:26,310 --> 04:27:27,510
They were looking for me.

6569
04:27:29,390 --> 04:27:30,350
I'm trying.

6570
04:27:33,610 --> 04:27:34,250
I made it.

6571
04:27:35,690 --> 04:27:36,490
I'm dead.

6572
04:27:36,990 --> 04:27:38,110
I'm not dead.

6573
04:27:38,990 --> 04:27:41,610
I'm not dead.

6574
04:27:44,570 --> 04:27:45,550
Fight on point.

6575
04:27:45,670 --> 04:27:46,310
Don't leave point.

6576
04:27:47,370 --> 04:27:48,130
Don't leave point.

6577
04:27:48,870 --> 04:27:49,330
Don't leave point.

6578
04:27:49,510 --> 04:27:49,930
Don't leave point.

6579
04:27:52,070 --> 04:27:52,130
Nice.

6580
04:27:54,910 --> 04:27:55,590
Wolverine is out.

6581
04:27:57,150 --> 04:27:58,430
I got the wrong guy.

6582
04:27:58,990 --> 04:27:59,910
I can't enter.

6583
04:27:59,910 --> 04:28:00,510
Nice.

6584
04:28:04,010 --> 04:28:05,570
I tried to stay on point.

6585
04:28:09,630 --> 04:28:11,150
That wasn't the worst one.

6586
04:28:11,690 --> 04:28:13,530
No, that was so much better.

6587
04:28:13,750 --> 04:28:14,970
I think we get next map.

6588
04:28:17,010 --> 04:28:18,570
No, I believe in us.

6589
04:28:19,790 --> 04:28:21,550
I mean, we did pretty well, I think.

6590
04:28:22,130 --> 04:28:24,450
I don't know what's going on with comms.

6591
04:28:24,570 --> 04:28:28,470
I don't know what's going on with comms right now.

6592
04:28:30,350 --> 04:28:33,380
I don't know.

6593
04:28:33,760 --> 04:28:37,740
Honestly, we are.

6594
04:28:41,940 --> 04:28:43,360
Maybe I'll go hella for you.

6595
04:28:44,160 --> 04:28:45,760
I'm going to go hella for you, Snoopy.

6596
04:28:50,260 --> 04:28:51,480
They banned Namor.

6597
04:28:52,200 --> 04:28:52,600
Yeah.

6598
04:28:54,660 --> 04:28:56,000
I saw Luna opening.

6599
04:28:56,180 --> 04:28:57,580
Do you see people banning Luna instead of Namor?

6600
04:28:57,720 --> 04:28:58,980
I was like, fuck it, we can run it.

6601
04:29:00,060 --> 04:29:03,260
We should have had three bans so we could get Iron Fist out.

6602
04:29:03,280 --> 04:29:04,660
I'm saying, fuck this guy.

6603
04:29:07,500 --> 04:29:10,120
Somebody in my chat just said Nekros isn't even trying.

6604
04:29:10,960 --> 04:29:11,400
Yeah.

6605
04:29:12,160 --> 04:29:14,600
Yeah, he's just fucking around.

6606
04:29:15,160 --> 04:29:17,360
Yeah, this guy is fucking sweating out of his mind, I can tell.

6607
04:29:17,420 --> 04:29:18,160
I've managed this all.

6608
04:29:18,920 --> 04:29:20,580
Yeah, let's get point control.

6609
04:29:21,540 --> 04:29:23,080
He's already above us, Jesus Christ.

6610
04:29:23,200 --> 04:29:24,060
This fucking roach.

6611
04:29:24,380 --> 04:29:25,720
He has his rollout on.

6612
04:29:27,180 --> 04:29:29,040
I hear him stepping on the metal.

6613
04:29:30,700 --> 04:29:31,760
He's on me.

6614
04:29:31,900 --> 04:29:32,700
Yup, yup, yup.

6615
04:29:36,980 --> 04:29:37,860
Nice, I got him.

6616
04:29:37,960 --> 04:29:40,640
You should respawn now.

6617
04:29:40,780 --> 04:29:41,000
I'm back.

6618
04:29:42,220 --> 04:29:42,580
Welcome.

6619
04:29:45,260 --> 04:29:46,980
Kill the cuck, kill the cuck, kill the cuck, kill the cuck.

6620
04:29:51,500 --> 04:29:53,340
Oh, he just got shielded.

6621
04:29:53,540 --> 04:29:53,760
That's fine.

6622
04:29:53,760 --> 04:29:55,900
Just fight on point again.

6623
04:29:56,360 --> 04:29:57,100
I have shift.

6624
04:29:57,800 --> 04:29:58,620
I got him, I got him.

6625
04:29:58,720 --> 04:29:59,720
Road's low, road's low.

6626
04:30:01,220 --> 04:30:01,580
Nice.

6627
04:30:03,360 --> 04:30:03,660
Nice.

6628
04:30:07,300 --> 04:30:08,520
Did you just backstab him?

6629
04:30:08,560 --> 04:30:10,120
Yeah, I scratched his back a couple times.

6630
04:30:10,940 --> 04:30:11,640
I have ult here.

6631
04:30:13,760 --> 04:30:14,820
Let them have the point then.

6632
04:30:15,880 --> 04:30:18,040
Just play on this thing right here.

6633
04:30:18,220 --> 04:30:18,620
For LOS.

6634
04:30:20,060 --> 04:30:21,060
Let them out, we can have ult.

6635
04:30:21,060 --> 04:30:23,120
I don't know what spells they have.

6636
04:30:23,140 --> 04:30:25,240
I have ulti, I have ulti for this fight.

6637
04:30:28,040 --> 04:30:31,000
Oh, he dropped back down, I think he's going around.

6638
04:30:31,080 --> 04:30:31,400
Be careful.

6639
04:30:33,660 --> 04:30:35,160
I'm 90%, I just need to hit once.

6640
04:30:35,780 --> 04:30:36,760
Oh, he got shielded.

6641
04:30:38,880 --> 04:30:39,740
He's parried already.

6642
04:30:42,260 --> 04:30:43,640
I have shift on the side, so I'm okay.

6643
04:30:44,140 --> 04:30:45,100
Road's low, grid's low.

6644
04:30:46,120 --> 04:30:46,460
I have ult.

6645
04:30:46,460 --> 04:30:47,800
I have blue on the ammo.

6646
04:30:50,640 --> 04:30:51,920
I got my ulti.

6647
04:30:52,500 --> 04:30:58,460
Oh my god, that's a lot of ults.

6648
04:31:01,200 --> 04:31:03,040
Just die on point, I guess.

6649
04:31:04,700 --> 04:31:06,680
Oh, and they grew an ulti for me.

6650
04:31:09,280 --> 04:31:10,780
That's five ults, right?

6651
04:31:10,920 --> 04:31:12,020
They only have hook and dagger ults.

6652
04:31:12,040 --> 04:31:13,420
That's a lot of ults.

6653
04:31:13,420 --> 04:31:15,620
They have hook ult.

6654
04:31:17,360 --> 04:31:17,480
No.

6655
04:31:21,280 --> 04:31:22,860
I can't believe it.

6656
04:31:22,960 --> 04:31:25,820
For little old me, they solo grew an ulti on me.

6657
04:31:28,060 --> 04:31:28,960
That's just rude.

6658
04:31:33,170 --> 04:31:34,360
I'm going up.

6659
04:31:36,720 --> 04:31:37,480
Grid's low.

6660
04:31:37,520 --> 04:31:39,200
Wolverine's on the right, can I walk in?

6661
04:31:39,500 --> 04:31:39,960
Yep.

6662
04:31:39,960 --> 04:31:40,800
Oh, they pushed.

6663
04:31:41,400 --> 04:31:42,080
Just back up.

6664
04:31:44,420 --> 04:31:46,120
We're good, we're good, we're good.

6665
04:31:48,900 --> 04:31:50,820
Oh shit, they're hard pushing me there.

6666
04:31:50,940 --> 04:31:51,660
That was my bad.

6667
04:31:52,520 --> 04:31:53,740
I should've just stayed with you guys.

6668
04:31:54,600 --> 04:31:55,460
I'm going to grab ult and go.

6669
04:31:58,120 --> 04:31:59,540
Come forward, come forward to point.

6670
04:32:00,200 --> 04:32:01,080
Okay, walking, walking, walking.

6671
04:32:01,260 --> 04:32:02,520
I'm walking, I'll walk, I'll walk.

6672
04:32:03,260 --> 04:32:05,440
This guy's just punching me in the back.

6673
04:32:05,440 --> 04:32:05,540
Fuck.

6674
04:32:08,680 --> 04:32:11,320
Yeah, yeah, looking at him.

6675
04:32:11,720 --> 04:32:12,200
He's asleep.

6676
04:32:12,820 --> 04:32:13,540
He's solo.

6677
04:32:16,960 --> 04:32:18,680
I'm walled off here.

6678
04:32:22,340 --> 04:32:24,860
I'm just getting walled non-stop.

6679
04:32:25,820 --> 04:32:27,420
Oh my god, I'm going to get bombed.

6680
04:32:28,300 --> 04:32:29,560
Oh, I have you.

6681
04:32:30,020 --> 04:32:31,020
Thank you.

6682
04:32:32,000 --> 04:32:32,880
Yeah, yeah.

6683
04:32:32,880 --> 04:32:34,820
Oh, okay, okay, walking, walking.

6684
04:32:35,180 --> 04:32:36,320
I got Cloak, I got Cloak.

6685
04:32:38,820 --> 04:32:40,120
Or I'm going to die, fuck.

6686
04:32:40,740 --> 04:32:41,680
Groot's one, Groot's one.

6687
04:32:42,460 --> 04:32:43,560
The cuck, the cuck, the cuck.

6688
04:32:43,760 --> 04:32:46,240
Oh my god, he's getting buggered here.

6689
04:32:46,240 --> 04:32:47,440
I can't even heal you through that.

6690
04:32:47,840 --> 04:32:49,580
He got in the eyes, dude.

6691
04:32:49,940 --> 04:32:51,520
I'm so dead.

6692
04:32:54,240 --> 04:32:55,460
I'm coming over.

6693
04:32:55,980 --> 04:32:58,320
He's behind us.

6694
04:32:58,320 --> 04:32:58,360
He's behind us.

6695
04:33:03,120 --> 04:33:04,300
Oh god, oh god, oh god.

6696
04:33:04,860 --> 04:33:06,080
Oh, sorry, I didn't do it.

6697
04:33:06,420 --> 04:33:07,640
Oh, yeah, it's okay.

6698
04:33:07,740 --> 04:33:09,020
There's so many walls.

6699
04:33:09,560 --> 04:33:12,860
Like, what do I do against that?

6700
04:33:14,260 --> 04:33:15,060
NT, NT.

6701
04:33:15,800 --> 04:33:17,020
It's a tough one.

6702
04:33:18,860 --> 04:33:21,920
That, like, they literally have someone for everything.

6703
04:33:22,280 --> 04:33:22,680
Yeah.

6704
04:33:23,480 --> 04:33:26,580
For an all-support team, we really held their, you know.

6705
04:33:26,580 --> 04:33:27,740
First time, guys.

6706
04:33:28,260 --> 04:33:30,280
That was my third team with all-support.

6707
04:33:38,340 --> 04:33:40,520
Is anyone in the final running?

6708
04:33:41,320 --> 04:33:42,860
I don't know.

6709
04:33:43,300 --> 04:33:46,460
It depends whether or not Kony wins his games for me.

6710
04:33:47,460 --> 04:33:51,720
Oh, I'm also waiting on Kony to see if they win I'm out.

6711
04:33:52,380 --> 04:33:55,300
Wait, but then, like, you guys are tiebreaker then, right?

6712
04:33:56,620 --> 04:33:58,320
Wait, no, Cindy, you're not in...

6713
04:33:58,320 --> 04:33:59,800
You're with...

6714
04:33:59,800 --> 04:34:02,900
Your bracket is Iman, Toast, Ray, Tarik, and Abe.

6715
04:34:03,840 --> 04:34:04,120
Yeah.

6716
04:34:04,600 --> 04:34:08,660
But, so, basically, Toast isn't playing because he's the tournament organizer.

6717
04:34:09,160 --> 04:34:09,420
Oh.

6718
04:34:09,700 --> 04:34:11,780
So, right now, it's me and Tarik.

6719
04:34:12,480 --> 04:34:16,440
But if Poki wins the next two, then I'm out.

6720
04:34:16,540 --> 04:34:17,840
But if she... Yeah.

6721
04:34:18,000 --> 04:34:21,220
I go to tiebreaker if she only wins one, but if she wins the next two, then I'm out.

6722
04:34:21,220 --> 04:34:24,220
So, I'm kind of just, like, waiting also to see how Kony and Poki's game goes.

6723
04:34:24,440 --> 04:34:24,660
Oh.

6724
04:34:26,000 --> 04:34:26,520
Yeah.

6725
04:34:28,580 --> 04:34:30,380
Well, thanks for the game.

6726
04:34:30,820 --> 04:34:31,460
GG's, guys.

6727
04:34:33,260 --> 04:34:33,960
They were fun.

6728
04:34:34,720 --> 04:34:35,480
It was fun.

6729
04:34:35,960 --> 04:34:37,940
Bye-bye, GG's.

6730
04:34:38,220 --> 04:34:39,160
Bye-bye, everybody.

6731
04:34:41,680 --> 04:34:42,120
Alright.

6732
04:34:42,780 --> 04:34:43,260
Yeah.

6733
04:34:44,560 --> 04:34:45,080
Um...

6734
04:34:47,460 --> 04:34:49,380
You know, um...

6735
04:34:49,380 --> 04:34:50,980
We won the game that matters.

6736
04:34:53,520 --> 04:34:54,340
Wait, what?

6737
04:34:54,800 --> 04:34:57,440
To be fair, I was either gonna...

6738
04:34:57,440 --> 04:35:01,200
I'm just glad... Okay, originally, I was actually gonna get the...

6739
04:35:01,200 --> 04:35:06,620
They were actually trying to put me in the leader spot, and then I got moved down a tier.

6740
04:35:07,680 --> 04:35:08,080
Um...

6741
04:35:08,080 --> 04:35:09,240
I got moved down a tier.

6742
04:35:09,400 --> 04:35:16,040
I was like, oh, thank God I got moved down a tier, because I was like, this Poki sucks, because I was like, oh, man, I feel bad.

6743
04:35:16,140 --> 04:35:20,160
But then I realized, when I got moved down a tier, it was still similar.

6744
04:35:21,720 --> 04:35:36,240
It was still a very similar situation, um, with me being the only support player on my tier as well, so I was just like, man...

6745
04:35:38,540 --> 04:35:48,620
That's so unlucky, because I was like the only support player in my tier, while everyone else gets to be the tank and DPS, and I was just like, oh...

6746
04:35:49,280 --> 04:35:50,780
That's rough for me.

6747
04:35:51,160 --> 04:35:52,680
That's so rough.

6748
04:35:54,560 --> 04:36:02,500
And then, and then Toast posted the matchups, the teams, and I was like, wait, aren't these mostly support players on my team?

6749
04:36:02,740 --> 04:36:06,680
So I went in the tournament knowing what was gonna happen.

6750
04:36:10,130 --> 04:36:15,370
I was like, I was like, I was like, just have fun, just have fun, Doki.

6751
04:36:15,890 --> 04:36:26,250
It's just here to get to know the people, um, get to know the people, and like, uh, just have, like, talk to the people you've never been able to talk to before.

6752
04:36:27,690 --> 04:36:28,110
Uh...

6753
04:36:30,070 --> 04:36:30,490
But...

6754
04:36:31,310 --> 04:36:34,210
I got, I got abandoned by RNGesus.

6755
04:36:34,350 --> 04:36:34,870
I did.

6756
04:36:36,430 --> 04:36:36,850
I...

6757
04:36:37,990 --> 04:36:40,710
RNG was definitely not on my side.

6758
04:36:41,330 --> 04:36:41,450
Oh.

6759
04:36:44,390 --> 04:36:47,930
We're at least four support players every every time.

6760
04:36:48,350 --> 04:37:07,010
Yeah, but like, the thing is, the lower tier ranks were mostly support players, and it's supposed to be like, um, it's supposed to be the top two tiers were the DPS and tank players, but like, unfortunately, I was not a DPS or tank player, so like, unfortunately,

6761
04:37:07,010 --> 04:37:13,970
it was a debuff for whoever got me, because it was just another support player.

6762
04:37:16,490 --> 04:37:17,910
But we won.

6763
04:37:18,890 --> 04:37:21,690
We did win the one round that matters.

6764
04:37:21,970 --> 04:37:27,190
We did win the one round that matters, guys.

6765
04:37:27,330 --> 04:37:29,450
That's, that's all that matters.

6766
04:37:30,310 --> 04:37:30,870
Um...

6767
04:37:30,870 --> 04:37:36,450
But yeah, no, I had a great time talking to people who I've never been able, who I've never had a chance to talk to before.

6768
04:37:36,910 --> 04:37:39,990
It's like that my OBS didn't work, um, in the beginning.

6769
04:37:40,690 --> 04:37:43,070
Uh, and we had a bad day.

6770
04:37:43,410 --> 04:37:44,310
Oh man, no.

6771
04:37:44,750 --> 04:37:48,110
I have been having a very unlucky, like, last two to three weeks.

6772
04:37:48,930 --> 04:37:53,190
My last, the year of the snake has not been going so well for me.

6773
04:37:53,590 --> 04:37:53,830
Uh...

6774
04:37:57,150 --> 04:38:06,110
Like, I just hope, I just hope that I get better health-wise soon, because like, that's the only thing I can control at the moment.

6775
04:38:06,570 --> 04:38:10,590
No, wait, not control, but that's the only thing that I can like, um...

6776
04:38:11,970 --> 04:38:15,690
that I hope to be able to like, not worry too much about.

6777
04:38:16,250 --> 04:38:16,690
Hahaha.

6778
04:38:19,430 --> 04:38:24,030
Um, but yeah, uh, I was gonna play rank after, but wait, let me see.

6779
04:38:25,690 --> 04:38:26,130
Uh...

6780
04:38:27,430 --> 04:38:35,850
I'm not sure if my, if, I was gonna ask like Gomez if he wants to duo, but I don't think he's awake, because I don't know if I want to solo after today.

6781
04:38:37,830 --> 04:38:39,610
I don't know.

6782
04:38:39,990 --> 04:38:40,690
I don't know.

6783
04:38:40,690 --> 04:38:43,190
After today, I don't know guys.

6784
04:38:43,530 --> 04:38:46,310
I don't know if I want to go through that.

6785
04:38:47,010 --> 04:38:47,270
Hahaha.

6786
04:38:48,250 --> 04:38:52,390
It's been pretty rough guys, not gonna lie.

6787
04:38:52,790 --> 04:38:54,250
It's been pretty rough.

6788
04:38:59,730 --> 04:39:00,330
Uh...

6789
04:39:00,330 --> 04:39:01,910
Yeah, it's like...

6790
04:39:01,910 --> 04:39:02,590
Hahaha.

6791
04:39:08,080 --> 04:39:09,960
Okay, but look at my...

6792
04:39:09,960 --> 04:39:13,280
Guys, guys, competitive is what matters.

6793
04:39:13,980 --> 04:39:14,540
Hahaha.

6794
04:39:17,000 --> 04:39:17,520
Com...

6795
04:39:17,520 --> 04:39:18,660
Com...

6796
04:39:19,690 --> 04:39:21,700
Competitive is what matters, guys.

6797
04:39:21,940 --> 04:39:23,840
This is, this is what's important.

6798
04:39:24,500 --> 04:39:26,860
Guys, this is what's important, okay?

6799
04:39:27,420 --> 04:39:28,980
Right, right here.

6800
04:39:29,820 --> 04:39:33,260
And this is what's important, everybody.

6801
04:39:33,800 --> 04:39:37,960
I just thought, you know what, maybe I can win a quick play game, you know what?

6802
04:39:38,060 --> 04:39:42,980
Maybe my luck turns around here and I win a quick play game.

6803
04:39:45,740 --> 04:39:46,380
Hahaha.

6804
04:39:48,340 --> 04:39:50,500
The life of a support player.

6805
04:39:51,120 --> 04:39:53,460
The life of being a support main.

6806
04:40:02,600 --> 04:40:03,120
Alright.

6807
04:40:04,880 --> 04:40:08,220
Maybe, maybe I won't play support after.

6808
04:40:08,420 --> 04:40:09,460
Oh my gosh, okay.

6809
04:40:09,580 --> 04:40:12,920
You know what, maybe give me here.

6810
04:40:14,020 --> 04:40:14,540
Hahaha.

6811
04:40:21,560 --> 04:40:22,680
Alright, it's alright.

6812
04:40:23,020 --> 04:40:25,900
Maybe, maybe I'll have a good support game.

6813
04:40:27,040 --> 04:40:28,540
Oh, the bubble overlay is still on?

6814
04:40:28,620 --> 04:40:29,540
I'll turn it off now.

6815
04:40:30,060 --> 04:40:40,780
I'll play a support game and if my, if like Gomez isn't awake by then, then like, then we're just gonna call it here.

6816
04:40:41,640 --> 04:40:43,620
I was thinking maybe we'll just get Eternity on stream.

6817
04:40:45,520 --> 04:40:46,600
Oh my god.

6818
04:40:47,720 --> 04:40:49,820
A normal, no it's not a normal comp.

6819
04:40:49,900 --> 04:40:51,120
It's literally a Hulk player.

6820
04:40:51,760 --> 04:40:52,280
Hahaha.

6821
04:40:54,600 --> 04:40:56,020
Oh my god, that hurt.

6822
04:40:56,160 --> 04:40:58,400
That actually, I've never seen so many losses.

6823
04:40:59,220 --> 04:41:00,940
That actually hurt to see.

6824
04:41:01,320 --> 04:41:01,440
Hahaha.

6825
04:41:06,580 --> 04:41:07,340
Oh my god.

6826
04:41:08,740 --> 04:41:10,720
Debuff by being a support player.

6827
04:41:18,260 --> 04:41:22,680
I literally was tempted to be like, can I I was like, oh it's for fun.

6828
04:41:22,740 --> 04:41:24,280
It doesn't matter what my team is.

6829
04:41:24,420 --> 04:41:27,660
Then now I'm like, oh man, that was Hahaha.

6830
04:41:30,300 --> 04:41:31,440
You're not Nekros.

6831
04:41:31,960 --> 04:41:33,640
I literally just fought Nekros himself.

6832
04:41:33,780 --> 04:41:34,880
Get out of my lobby.

6833
04:41:39,000 --> 04:41:40,580
What is he doing?

6834
04:41:40,720 --> 04:41:46,800
What is our Like, what the fuck are these guys doing?

6835
04:41:47,760 --> 04:41:48,280
Hahaha.

6836
04:41:52,340 --> 04:41:53,340
It was fun.

6837
04:41:53,560 --> 04:41:55,980
Everything's, you're not, he's actually not him.

6838
04:41:56,380 --> 04:41:59,100
I literally had to fight a fucking raid boss today.

6839
04:41:59,420 --> 04:42:01,220
Honestly, like, um.

6840
04:42:01,360 --> 04:42:02,200
Oh shit.

6841
04:42:06,470 --> 04:42:08,090
Oh my god, you're such a coward.

6842
04:42:08,310 --> 04:42:09,410
You're such a little coward.

6843
04:42:09,590 --> 04:42:10,970
Oh, you're such a bitch.

6844
04:42:11,470 --> 04:42:15,570
I think we could have countered it.

6845
04:42:16,070 --> 04:42:17,310
Countered Nekros more.

6846
04:42:17,730 --> 04:42:20,730
Oh, he's just not having a good time.

6847
04:42:21,190 --> 04:42:22,010
Not gonna lie.

6848
04:42:23,570 --> 04:42:25,230
No healing can save that.

6849
04:42:28,150 --> 04:42:28,570
Hahaha.

6850
04:42:29,010 --> 04:42:30,330
You're definitely not him.

6851
04:42:31,090 --> 04:42:33,670
Oh my god, you're definitely not him.

6852
04:42:34,330 --> 04:42:35,390
Holy shit.

6853
04:42:40,350 --> 04:42:41,190
Shoot this.

6854
04:42:41,450 --> 04:42:42,070
Shoot this, shoot this.

6855
04:42:42,350 --> 04:42:44,090
Shoot, guys, you're not gonna shoot it?

6856
04:42:44,170 --> 04:42:44,730
That's cool.

6857
04:42:46,090 --> 04:42:47,210
Guys, please.

6858
04:42:47,590 --> 04:42:48,430
Okay, that's fine.

6859
04:42:48,930 --> 04:42:49,150
Hahaha.

6860
04:42:51,230 --> 04:42:53,010
Guys, I need a win.

6861
04:42:53,390 --> 04:42:53,870
Hahaha.

6862
04:42:58,320 --> 04:42:59,660
Oh, you're such a coward.

6863
04:43:00,020 --> 04:43:01,620
You're actually such a little bitch.

6864
04:43:06,300 --> 04:43:07,480
You're so bad.

6865
04:43:08,220 --> 04:43:08,780
Hahaha.

6866
04:43:08,780 --> 04:43:09,120
Hahaha.

6867
04:43:12,360 --> 04:43:14,800
These movements are so predictable now.

6868
04:43:16,860 --> 04:43:18,380
I gotta fix that win rate.

6869
04:43:18,420 --> 04:43:22,180
I just gotta have that one win in that leader in the history.

6870
04:43:22,800 --> 04:43:24,760
Just that one win is all that matters.

6871
04:43:26,400 --> 04:43:27,440
Playing nice?

6872
04:43:28,400 --> 04:43:32,680
People weren't playing nice when I was in the fucking five support team three times.

6873
04:43:33,020 --> 04:43:33,620
Hahaha.

6874
04:43:34,740 --> 04:43:38,560
Why weren't people playing nice when I had to deal with that?

6875
04:43:40,680 --> 04:43:43,160
For three of my teams.

6876
04:43:44,980 --> 04:43:49,380
Why did no one show me mercy when that happened?

6877
04:43:50,100 --> 04:43:50,660
Hahaha.

6878
04:43:58,280 --> 04:44:00,780
Okay, guys, you don't jump when I ult.

6879
04:44:04,300 --> 04:44:04,820
Disappear.

6880
04:44:04,820 --> 04:44:05,080
Disappear.

6881
04:44:05,400 --> 04:44:06,600
Just gonna dance.

6882
04:44:06,780 --> 04:44:07,880
Guys, I need you guys.

6883
04:44:09,900 --> 04:44:10,740
I'm gonna die here.

6884
04:44:11,000 --> 04:44:12,200
Oh, this is where I die.

6885
04:44:12,860 --> 04:44:14,060
This is where I die.

6886
04:44:16,920 --> 04:44:18,200
Okay, our hook.

6887
04:44:18,840 --> 04:44:20,460
Like, okay, guys.

6888
04:44:20,600 --> 04:44:21,420
Oh my, guys.

6889
04:44:22,120 --> 04:44:23,080
What the fuck?

6890
04:44:23,680 --> 04:44:25,340
This is my villain backstory.

6891
04:44:26,540 --> 04:44:27,520
It truly is.

6892
04:44:28,620 --> 04:44:31,000
I need to get back on point.

6893
04:44:36,840 --> 04:44:38,360
Never leave point.

6894
04:44:38,580 --> 04:44:39,980
Never leave point.

6895
04:44:40,480 --> 04:44:42,340
Never leave point, Hulk.

6896
04:44:42,880 --> 04:44:44,720
Oh, this is where he dies.

6897
04:44:44,820 --> 04:44:45,480
That's for sure.

6898
04:44:46,000 --> 04:44:47,740
This is definitely where he dies.

6899
04:44:50,400 --> 04:44:51,260
DPS Jeff?

6900
04:44:51,400 --> 04:44:52,300
Jeff is left-throw.

6901
04:44:52,700 --> 04:44:53,420
It doesn't fucking matter.

6902
04:44:54,020 --> 04:44:54,540
Hahaha.

6903
04:44:55,940 --> 04:44:57,620
He's not meta in higher elo.

6904
04:44:58,020 --> 04:45:03,540
Unless you're like a pure one-trick Jeff player, you have to play Jeff in triple support.

6905
04:45:04,260 --> 04:45:05,900
And even then, he's such a throw.

6906
04:45:10,280 --> 04:45:13,160
He's not like an actual pick in higher elo.

6907
04:45:13,840 --> 04:45:18,880
Triple support is like Cloak, Luna, Mantis, and Invis woman.

6908
04:45:19,520 --> 04:45:20,240
Or Loki.

6909
04:45:21,000 --> 04:45:21,760
Either works.

6910
04:45:23,320 --> 04:45:23,960
Yeah.

6911
04:45:24,580 --> 04:45:27,920
His ult, it's because his ult is not a defensive ult.

6912
04:45:28,480 --> 04:45:36,320
So like, because his ult isn't offensive, there's no reason to play Jeff because he... Aww.

6913
04:45:37,700 --> 04:45:38,340
Hahaha.

6914
04:45:40,020 --> 04:45:40,580
Aww.

6915
04:45:41,700 --> 04:45:42,960
That's sad.

6916
04:45:43,880 --> 04:45:44,720
That sucks.

6917
04:45:44,880 --> 04:45:46,300
He's looking for it again.

6918
04:45:46,580 --> 04:45:47,460
He's looking for it.

6919
04:45:49,880 --> 04:45:52,360
He's doing that fucking TikTok clip.

6920
04:45:56,720 --> 04:45:58,580
She's trying to do a TikTok clip.

6921
04:45:58,680 --> 04:45:59,880
That fucking Invisible woman.

6922
04:46:00,580 --> 04:46:01,760
There she is.

6923
04:46:05,800 --> 04:46:06,520
Bro.

6924
04:46:07,220 --> 04:46:07,940
Bro.

6925
04:46:08,380 --> 04:46:09,120
Oh, okay.

6926
04:46:09,380 --> 04:46:10,440
I mean, thank God.

6927
04:46:10,800 --> 04:46:11,280
Hahaha.

6928
04:46:14,460 --> 04:46:15,080
Adam?

6929
04:46:15,760 --> 04:46:17,780
Last season, yeah.

6930
04:46:19,020 --> 04:46:19,340
Sure.

6931
04:46:19,340 --> 04:46:23,060
Last season, Adam was viable.

6932
04:46:29,880 --> 04:46:31,300
Okay, let's just...

6933
04:46:31,300 --> 04:46:32,460
Alright, guys, guys.

6934
04:46:32,640 --> 04:46:33,600
Come on, guys.

6935
04:46:36,180 --> 04:46:36,740
Alright.

6936
04:46:37,480 --> 04:46:39,060
Alright, here we go.

6937
04:46:39,260 --> 04:46:40,940
I'm just... Yippee.

6938
04:46:41,760 --> 04:46:42,320
Woo.

6939
04:46:43,280 --> 04:46:43,840
Yippee.

6940
04:46:44,120 --> 04:46:45,320
I guess I'll just...

6941
04:46:45,320 --> 04:46:47,140
Whoa, do you see all of them looking at me?

6942
04:46:47,180 --> 04:46:48,180
I'm not gonna live.

6943
04:46:48,180 --> 04:46:48,580
I...

6944
04:46:48,580 --> 04:46:49,680
Hahaha.

6945
04:46:51,220 --> 04:46:51,860
Hahaha.

6946
04:46:53,400 --> 04:46:54,720
Oh shit, nice.

6947
04:46:55,080 --> 04:46:55,680
Hahaha.

6948
04:46:57,280 --> 04:46:59,720
Please, I worked so hard getting there.

6949
04:47:00,160 --> 04:47:00,560
Hahaha.

6950
04:47:02,720 --> 04:47:04,140
Oh my God.

6951
04:47:04,240 --> 04:47:07,940
We actually managed to claim it back.

6952
04:47:08,100 --> 04:47:09,720
We went triple support?

6953
04:47:10,100 --> 04:47:11,540
Are you... Okay.

6954
04:47:12,300 --> 04:47:12,900
Hahaha.

6955
04:47:13,640 --> 04:47:15,740
You can't leave triple support.

6956
04:47:15,740 --> 04:47:18,380
Not even in quick play.

6957
04:47:18,820 --> 04:47:20,520
That's crazy.

6958
04:47:21,780 --> 04:47:24,160
Okay, they're leading just a little bit.

6959
04:47:26,300 --> 04:47:29,740
None of us can ever leave triple support, I guess.

6960
04:47:30,240 --> 04:47:30,740
Hahaha.

6961
04:47:36,560 --> 04:47:37,520
Wait, what?

6962
04:47:37,720 --> 04:47:38,660
Where's your ult?

6963
04:47:40,360 --> 04:47:41,520
Wait, what?

6964
04:47:41,820 --> 04:47:42,480
You know what, fuck this.

6965
04:47:42,540 --> 04:47:42,940
I'm playing strange.

6966
04:47:43,240 --> 04:47:44,420
I'm gonna learn strange right now.

6967
04:47:44,900 --> 04:47:45,500
Hahaha.

6968
04:47:46,800 --> 04:47:47,940
Fuck this.

6969
04:47:47,940 --> 04:47:52,360
If I know anything, I know strange is fucking op as fuck.

6970
04:47:56,900 --> 04:47:58,620
Alright, here we go.

6971
04:47:59,300 --> 04:48:02,580
If I know anything about this game.

6972
04:48:05,240 --> 04:48:06,160
Alright.

6973
04:48:08,040 --> 04:48:09,200
Oh, nevermind.

6974
04:48:12,040 --> 04:48:12,960
Nevermind.

6975
04:48:13,960 --> 04:48:15,000
That felt terrible.

6976
04:48:15,420 --> 04:48:16,040
Hahaha.

6977
04:48:17,220 --> 04:48:17,460
Hahaha.

6978
04:48:17,460 --> 04:48:17,620
Hahaha.

6979
04:48:20,020 --> 04:48:22,180
Now I know why I don't play tank.

6980
04:48:23,220 --> 04:48:23,740
Hahaha.

6981
04:48:28,840 --> 04:48:30,480
I think today's just the fuck...

6982
04:48:30,480 --> 04:48:32,020
I think it's just the fucked up month.

6983
04:48:35,520 --> 04:48:37,780
I think I got all my wins just from rank.

6984
04:48:43,670 --> 04:48:45,730
Legitimately all my... all my fucking...

6985
04:48:47,510 --> 04:48:48,850
You're so stupid.

6986
04:48:48,990 --> 04:48:49,170
Okay.

6987
04:48:49,870 --> 04:48:50,430
Hahaha.

6988
04:48:51,690 --> 04:48:53,370
I say it as I get frozen.

6989
04:48:53,690 --> 04:48:55,490
Bro, she literally stood still.

6990
04:48:55,730 --> 04:48:59,570
I was just like, what are you doing?

6991
04:49:03,220 --> 04:49:04,960
I was so confused.

6992
04:49:10,960 --> 04:49:11,720
She has ult.

6993
04:49:12,220 --> 04:49:16,100
Oh my god.

6994
04:49:17,980 --> 04:49:19,720
Wait, is that Captain America?

6995
04:49:20,020 --> 04:49:22,360
Oh my god, is that a tank right there?

6996
04:49:22,360 --> 04:49:23,980
Holy shit.

6997
04:49:25,320 --> 04:49:26,540
Oh, fuck it.

6998
04:49:27,440 --> 04:49:28,240
Oh my god.

6999
04:49:28,320 --> 04:49:29,320
That was a tank.

7000
04:49:29,480 --> 04:49:31,080
We actually have a tank.

7001
04:49:31,220 --> 04:49:32,240
Oh my god.

7002
04:49:33,280 --> 04:49:34,000
Whoa.

7003
04:49:37,240 --> 04:49:38,300
Someone please.

7004
04:49:40,840 --> 04:49:42,140
Someone please.

7005
04:49:44,920 --> 04:49:47,280
Like... oh, he's just standing there.

7006
04:49:47,940 --> 04:49:49,360
He doesn't even care.

7007
04:49:49,360 --> 04:49:49,420
He doesn't even care.

7008
04:49:58,130 --> 04:49:59,570
Wait, what the fuck?

7009
04:49:59,650 --> 04:50:00,770
What is she doing here?

7010
04:50:05,270 --> 04:50:07,890
What the fuck is this Invisi-woman doing?

7011
04:50:13,140 --> 04:50:14,260
Oh no.

7012
04:50:18,570 --> 04:50:19,210
Okay.

7013
04:50:19,630 --> 04:50:20,770
Nice, she's out.

7014
04:50:22,310 --> 04:50:23,470
I hear her.

7015
04:50:25,630 --> 04:50:29,350
Like, I hear the Invisi-woman, which is very annoying too.

7016
04:50:30,210 --> 04:50:32,050
Like, I'm bumping into her.

7017
04:50:39,150 --> 04:50:40,470
Oh, there she is.

7018
04:50:41,310 --> 04:50:42,330
Oh, fuck no.

7019
04:50:42,570 --> 04:50:42,770
Nice.

7020
04:50:45,930 --> 04:50:46,790
Oh my god.

7021
04:50:46,870 --> 04:50:48,410
This Invisi-woman is so annoying.

7022
04:50:48,710 --> 04:50:49,790
I hate her footsteps.

7023
04:50:49,950 --> 04:50:51,630
She's just like, pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa.

7024
04:50:51,810 --> 04:50:52,830
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa.

7025
04:50:54,310 --> 04:50:56,450
I'm like, oh, please shut up.

7026
04:50:57,370 --> 04:50:58,790
Stop making noises.

7027
04:51:02,210 --> 04:51:04,050
He has Wolverine, I can tell.

7028
04:51:04,370 --> 04:51:05,750
He wants to use it.

7029
04:51:07,910 --> 04:51:08,950
Oh my god.

7030
04:51:09,150 --> 04:51:12,630
Oh my god, we're - I don't want to jinx this right now.

7031
04:51:12,710 --> 04:51:13,490
I'm a little afraid.

7032
04:51:13,930 --> 04:51:15,830
Oh my god, we did it.

7033
04:51:15,910 --> 04:51:16,950
We broke the curse.

7034
04:51:18,130 --> 04:51:19,730
We did it.

7035
04:51:20,030 --> 04:51:21,810
We broke the curse.

7036
04:51:22,450 --> 04:51:23,750
We did it.

7037
04:51:25,390 --> 04:51:32,240
My leaderboard doesn't look that- How do we have- Okay.

7038
04:51:33,880 --> 04:51:35,300
Oh my god.

7039
04:51:36,320 --> 04:51:37,520
We did it.

7040
04:51:38,500 --> 04:51:41,720
My leaderboard doesn't look that bad.

7041
04:51:47,240 --> 04:51:48,360
Oh my god.

7042
04:51:48,500 --> 04:51:49,760
Alright, he's out of way.

7043
04:51:49,820 --> 04:51:51,540
So I'm going to call it here, everybody.

7044
04:51:52,220 --> 04:51:53,180
Alright, guys.

7045
04:51:54,900 --> 04:51:56,000
Tomorrow, I'm resting.

7046
04:51:57,420 --> 04:52:01,280
The day after tomorrow is going to be our anniversary when I return.

7047
04:52:01,640 --> 04:52:04,900
I don't have much planned for tomorrow- for the day after tomorrow.

7048
04:52:05,180 --> 04:52:07,160
I'm going to be really frank with you guys.

7049
04:52:07,820 --> 04:52:12,600
It's just more so I'm most likely- I don't have anything really special.

7050
04:52:12,840 --> 04:52:15,860
I've been tired a lot.

7051
04:52:17,020 --> 04:52:19,740
So I couldn't really plan anything for it.

7052
04:52:19,800 --> 04:52:22,420
So I really hope you guys still want to celebrate it with me.

7053
04:52:23,600 --> 04:52:25,000
I still have fun.

7054
04:52:25,400 --> 04:52:27,540
I get to interact with a lot of people today.

7055
04:52:30,840 --> 04:52:34,600
I got to do some sick freezes.

7056
04:52:36,200 --> 04:52:41,340
I really wanted to try to get Eternity on stream, but I don't want to do it solo.

7057
04:52:41,640 --> 04:52:42,860
It's been fucking rough.

7058
04:52:45,460 --> 04:52:48,320
After the games we had, it's fucking rough.

7059
04:52:48,440 --> 04:52:49,800
I don't want to do it solo.

7060
04:52:50,360 --> 04:52:51,380
I don't want to play solo.

7061
04:52:52,620 --> 04:52:54,040
I'm glad to be back.

7062
04:52:54,760 --> 04:52:57,360
I'm going to be doing regular schedule stuff.

7063
04:52:58,440 --> 04:52:59,840
We're back again.

7064
04:53:00,260 --> 04:53:05,980
There's going to be no vacation or anything or me disappearing for the next couple of months.

7065
04:53:06,240 --> 04:53:11,580
So we're back to regular scheduled regular scheduled DokiBerry content.

7066
04:53:13,220 --> 04:53:14,300
I'm super excited.

7067
04:53:14,920 --> 04:53:20,760
As always, everybody stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

7068
04:53:20,900 --> 04:53:24,220
And if you stay up for me, head to bed because you deserve it.

7069
04:53:24,320 --> 04:53:25,580
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

7070
04:53:25,920 --> 04:53:26,760
Bye, guys.

7071
04:53:27,180 --> 04:53:27,660
Bye.

7072
04:53:29,240 --> 04:53:29,640
Bye.

7073
04:53:42,660 --> 04:53:45,960
Guys, I just realized I didn't eat anything at all today.

7074
04:53:46,120 --> 04:53:47,340
All I did was just hydrate.

7075
04:53:47,460 --> 04:53:48,040
Oh my gosh.

7076
04:53:48,720 --> 04:53:50,540
Guys, I'm not a human anymore.

7077
04:53:50,760 --> 04:53:51,640
Anyway, bye guys.

7078
04:53:51,760 --> 04:53:52,080
Bye.
