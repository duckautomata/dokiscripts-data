00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,310
Hello everybody!

2
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,450
Hello, hello, hello!

3
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:49,790
I apologize that this is a very early stream for Resident Evil 4.

4
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:59,230
I wanted to start early today because I was like, okay, if we're doing a long stream, I don't want to get to the scary part when it's nighttime.

5
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:08,750
I want to get to the scary part when the sun is just going down.

6
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:14,510
So that is why.

7
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:21,070
I know it's a different time slot compared to like the part one of Resident Evil 4.

8
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:29,210
But like, guys, it is for the sake of my sanity that we play the game when it's not that scary.

9
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:29,470
When it's not dark.

10
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,230
So...

11
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,210
It's not cheating!

12
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,590
It's the sky!

13
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:44,790
So that is why we are playing it at an earlier time slot.

14
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:51,130
Because, like I said, I don't want to, you know, I don't want to get to the scary...

15
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:56,870
Like, if we're doing a long stream, most likely some of the scarier parts happen at a later time.

16
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,190
So like, you know, maybe if I play for a long stream, I'm going to get to the scary part.

17
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:00,430
Like if I play for like five or six hours.

18
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:05,950
And it's scary, I can look outside and be like, oh, the sun is still out.

19
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,590
So like this is not real.

20
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:16,210
When it gets dark, I can be like, I'll be like, there's a possibility this can happen.

21
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:21,850
But when I see that the sun is still out, I'd be like, it's not real because the sun is still out.

22
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,590
Hey, thank you for the super chat.

23
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:29,490
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

24
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:30,570
Perfect time for EU.

25
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,390
Almost set to 9pm.

26
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:33,710
They gave us a superchat.

27
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:34,750
Thank you, thank you.

28
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,390
Yeah, so this is... this is...

29
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:41,810
Whenever I do play Visage, I'm gonna make sure it's the 12.30pm slot.

30
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:46,210
Because there's no fucking way I'm playing Visage when there's sun and it's out.

31
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,250
There's no fucking way.

32
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,390
You can't make me.

33
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,030
Alright.

34
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:53,490
Alright, here we go.

35
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:55,790
I already forgot all the controls, by the way.

36
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:58,270
So this is... you guys gotta help me.

37
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,610
I already... I actually forgot all the fucking controls for this game.

38
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:07,390
It's... after like a day, I just forgot how to play video games in general.

39
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,390
Oh, this part.

40
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:15,190
Okay, we can... I mean, we can rewatch this.

41
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,950
Left click does stuff.

42
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,370
Oh shit, really?

43
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:28,890
Oh my god!

44
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:35,570
Oh yeah, he like... he got like injected with things.

45
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,490
He became Coca-Cola Bear.

46
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,880
Oh yeah, it's Adam Sadler!

47
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,680
Trina, thank you for the superchat.

48
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,540
Thank you, thank you.

49
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,720
Yeah, thank you for the superchat.

50
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:55,420
Thank you, thank you.

51
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,960
Passed Doki, made the right choice.

52
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,500
Have lots of fun, Doki.

53
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,960
Can't catch the stream right now, but I'll definitely watch the VOD.

54
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,320
Or chapter 5 that I'm making.

55
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,120
I'll check it on time later.

56
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:03,960
Thank you for the superchat.

57
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:04,780
Thank you, thank you.

58
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:05,120
I feel you.

59
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,380
I'm thinking of the 20 gifted chips.

60
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,680
Thank you, thank you.

61
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,140
Alright, here we go.

62
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,820
How to melee.

63
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,320
I'll figure this out.

64
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,620
I'm not alright.

65
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,560
Ma'am, I got injected by Coca-Cola Bear.

66
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,860
Or by Adam Sadler.

67
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,760
I don't know which is worse.

68
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,700
Oh, F.

69
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,340
I figured it out.

70
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,100
F is melee.

71
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,640
I figured it out, guys.

72
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,020
I... okay.

73
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:49,960
The only other... the only other way I hate playing when the sun is out is that it makes me realize just how dirty my monitor is.

74
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,880
Because when the sun shines just right...

75
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,220
On your monitor.

76
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,140
Too real.

77
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:10,300
That's the only thing I hate about mothaflame.

78
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,760
When the sun is out.

79
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,660
When it sunshines just right.

80
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,300
You can see everything on your mo...

81
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,940
I'm gonna fucking... give me a sec, guys.

82
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,140
I need to close my blinds.

83
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,360
I can't... I can't feel like... I don't wanna see.

84
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,760
I don't wanna see how fucked up my monitor is.

85
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:30,580
Alright.

86
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:31,740
It's okay.

87
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,640
The sun is still shining through my blinds.

88
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,120
Because...

89
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,060
There we go.

90
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,440
I feel less guilty now.

91
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,580
Ah, shit.

92
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,100
I forgot there was... this was the reason why I stopped playing.

93
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,020
I forgot that this was the reason.

94
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,380
Where the fuck is my map?

95
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,440
Okay.

96
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,520
Where do I go?

97
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,380
Okay, I'm gonna go to the dead end?

98
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,820
Is this dead end?

99
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,580
This is dead end.

100
00:07:59,640 --> 00:07:59,860
Okay.

101
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,520
There must be like loot, right?

102
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,340
Oh, wait.

103
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,320
What?

104
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,180
Oh, no.

105
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:06,760
I'm turning.

106
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:07,860
I'm hearing the voices.

107
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,040
Oh, no.

108
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,300
I didn't take my meds.

109
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:11,900
Oh.

110
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,220
Ohhhhhhh.

111
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,820
I don't like this.

112
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,480
Come out the bush!

113
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,020
Oh, loot.

114
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:24,800
Ohhhhhhh.

115
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,800
This is why I play in the morning!

116
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:29,560
Okay.

117
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,820
Oh, I'm lost.

118
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:34,420
Oh, I'm freaking out that I don't even know where to go.

119
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,600
I hate this.

120
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,300
I hate this.

121
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,860
I hate this.

122
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,540
I hate this so much.

123
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:42,840
Stop!

124
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,300
I'll never take my meds!

125
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:45,580
Oh, hey.

126
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,100
Barrow.

127
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,600
Okay, I need to take the barrow first.

128
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:49,740
Barrow time.

129
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,160
Oh.

130
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:52,980
Oh.

131
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:53,760
Oh.

132
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:53,940
Oh.

133
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,440
Oh, the voices are only in that area.

134
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,360
Oh.

135
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,940
If I close my eyes.

136
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,140
Okay.

137
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,140
Money.

138
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:02,920
Oh.

139
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,600
Oh.

140
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,140
Oh.

141
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:04,820
Oh.

142
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:05,700
Hello?

143
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:07,540
Hello?

144
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,060
Who's there?

145
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,340
Whoa!

146
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:09,840
Whoa!

147
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,460
Who's there?

148
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,760
Who's there?

149
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,980
Oh, I don't like this.

150
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,100
I don't like this at all.

151
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,780
Oh, the voices are back.

152
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,360
The voices are back.

153
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,210
Get out of the bush!

154
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:33,810
Oh, no.

155
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:35,590
Oh, no.

156
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:36,650
What are they even saying?

157
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,190
Oh, there's the bones.

158
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:40,470
There's the bones.

159
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:42,710
Oh, there they are.

160
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:46,430
Oh.

161
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:48,690
Oh, oh.

162
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,720
What's going on?

163
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,300
What?

164
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:54,540
Oh!

165
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,000
Oh, that's a sniper!

166
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,620
Oh, shit!

167
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,160
Where do I shoot?

168
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,500
The head?

169
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:10,340
Where do I shoot?

170
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,260
He has no head!

171
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:19,140
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, you have a head though.

172
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,640
Oh, God.

173
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,640
There you go.

174
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,400
I think that's your head.

175
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,160
Oh, what?

176
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:29,880
Okay.

177
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,500
If I shoot that, that's your head.

178
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,280
If I shoot the leg... if I shoot the leg!

179
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,960
You can't walk, right?

180
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:35,860
Okay.

181
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,680
Okay, nope.

182
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,300
Alright.

183
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:40,760
Shotgun time.

184
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,740
If it all fails, it's shotgun time.

185
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,960
Oh no.

186
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,060
What flashbang?

187
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,760
I don't work... oh there it is.

188
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,460
That flash.

189
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,980
No, no, no, no, no, no.

190
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,260
Okay.

191
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,700
Register shortcut.

192
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:00,740
Alright, there.

193
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,200
I'll put that here.

194
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,440
Alright, I don't have a lot... I don't have a lot of fucking shotgun ammo.

195
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,380
That's great.

196
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:11,620
I should have not shot the knees when that thing came out.

197
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:12,780
Alright.

198
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:16,420
Well, I assume that headshots don't work right now.

199
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:22,100
I assume that headshots do not work on these guys.

200
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,560
Craft.

201
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,280
Oh, I don't have enough shotgun.

202
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,400
Wait, do I not have enough?

203
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,800
I should have enough.

204
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,200
Yeah.

205
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,980
Okay, we're gonna make shotgun shells.

206
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,240
We're gonna need it.

207
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:31,920
Alright.

208
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:32,940
They do?

209
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,600
Oh, they do work?

210
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,320
Oh, okay.

211
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,600
So I just keep aiming the head.

212
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,160
Okay.

213
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,400
Alright.

214
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,520
Okay, they still have brains in there.

215
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,180
Okay, that's good.

216
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,220
I couldn't tell!

217
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,420
There were like so many things coming out of the head!

218
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,000
I don't know, maybe there were like mini brains in like various areas.

219
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,380
Like, what's... I don't know the logic of parasites.

220
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,160
Like...

221
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,500
I don't know the logic of Resident Evil 4 parasites.

222
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,340
How would I know?

223
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,660
Cause I already killed the brain!

224
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,420
Where are the other brains?

225
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,200
Like, where...

226
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,980
Where are the mini brains?

227
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,820
Aim for the head tentacles.

228
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,140
I don't know that!

229
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,640
Are there mini brains in the tentacles?

230
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,360
Am I supposed to assume that?

231
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,140
They are weak to...

232
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:25,500
Yeah!

233
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,100
Okay.

234
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,280
Yeah, but will they die from light?

235
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,820
They might be weak to light, but will they... they won't die from it!

236
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,620
That's the thing!

237
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,360
I need Tetris this.

238
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,400
This is like so fucking messy.

239
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,400
Wait, is that a chocolate bar?

240
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,120
What is this?

241
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,000
Oh, it's an rifle.

242
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,040
I was like, why do I have a chocolate bar?

243
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:49,660
Okay.

244
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,060
Alright, here we go.

245
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,880
Where do I go?

246
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,880
I'm already lost.

247
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,880
Oh, I go...

248
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,500
Oh, wait, what?

249
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,900
There was a way over here?

250
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,220
Oh.

251
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,120
Oh, I can barely see!

252
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:07,620
It's...

253
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,680
Like, the thing I hate is that Leon doesn't turn on his fucking flashlight!

254
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,100
Like, when it's clearly very...

255
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:16,640
Whoa.

256
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,120
Whoa.

257
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:17,600
Whoa.

258
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,300
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

259
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,240
Who's there?

260
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,400
I have a shotgun!

261
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,060
Who's there?

262
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,600
Leon, please!

263
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,920
Just turn on your fucking flashlight!

264
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,660
It's so dark!

265
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,300
Like...

266
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,280
It's... I'm turning on this brightness.

267
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,000
I can't.

268
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,740
I'm fucking blind right now.

269
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,160
I can't fucking deal with this, Leon.

270
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,640
Leon, please!

271
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,320
All I ask you is to turn on your fucking flashlight!

272
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,400
Jesus Christ, Leon!

273
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:54,460
Okay.

274
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,400
I guess a little better.

275
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,780
Oh my god, this is so much...

276
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,420
Oh, thank you!

277
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,120
Thank you!

278
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,700
Thank you!

279
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,540
Okay, what is this place?

280
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,700
Leon eats his carrots.

281
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,880
Fuck carrots.

282
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,900
What's carrots done for me?

283
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,500
The Shrine of Hands.

284
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,760
Firmly grasp it.

285
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,980
Same mark from the church.

286
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,540
Is this the hand guard?

287
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:35,350
What the fuck do I put in there?

288
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:37,590
Alright, it's time to figure it fine out.

289
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,150
Oh god!

290
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,430
Okay, there's a boat.

291
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,010
I don't like this.

292
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,670
God, I hate this level so fucking much.

293
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:48,490
Do I put the head?

294
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,910
Oh, there's the monster I killed!

295
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:53,170
Oh!

296
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:54,570
What's in here?

297
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,610
Wait, there's treasures?

298
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,730
Oh, there's a lot of treasures.

299
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:01,890
Okay, we're gonna have to go there.

300
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:05,150
And then we have to go there to grab stuff.

301
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:06,850
Uh...

302
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:08,610
Oh my god, why is there...

303
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:10,750
Why is there a maze-like thing here?

304
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:11,730
I don't like that.

305
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,550
Alright, and then...

306
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,610
So we go there.

307
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:15,870
And then...

308
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:18,590
Oh wait, but there's like loot in the middle of the lake!

309
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:19,970
How do I get to the middle?

310
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,070
I can't fucking swim apparently.

311
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,150
Wait, is that the right game?

312
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,250
Oh no, all the games are blurring together.

313
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:28,450
No, I can't swim.

314
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,450
No, Leon can swim, nevermind.

315
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:35,290
Sorry.

316
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:40,570
All the games are blurring together because usually I can't swim.

317
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:47,370
We have to manually drive the boat myself?

318
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:50,730
That's fucked up.

319
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,910
Why do I have to drive the boat myself?

320
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,590
That's what the game is for.

321
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:56,870
That's what cutscenes are for.

322
00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:00,390
Are you telling me I don't get the privilege of cutscenes?

323
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:01,750
Okay.

324
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:04,470
Someone fetched me a rare golden chicken egg.

325
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:05,990
Oh shit.

326
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:06,490
Okay.

327
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:09,650
Well, time to see if the chickens will lay me an egg.

328
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,350
Uh, what's in here?

329
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:14,230
What are you?

330
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,310
The old way shrine.

331
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:17,750
What door does this open?

332
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,630
All the locations are...

333
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,910
I can't remember, man.

334
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,870
Wait, I do have to drive the boat!

335
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:30,530
What?

336
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,650
Where's my cutscene privileges?

337
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,490
Oh, no.

338
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:39,250
I have to throw the fucking spear too?

339
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:41,570
Goddamn.

340
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,030
I'm so sad.

341
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,150
There's no cutscene privileges.

342
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:49,410
I have to do this all by hand.

343
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:51,490
Boop.

344
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:53,810
I guess I'll grab that $100.

345
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:56,030
Oh, it's $100 now?

346
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:58,250
I remember when barrels were $1000.

347
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,130
Inflation happened.

348
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,450
Do you remember?

349
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:07,110
Okay, isn't that the boat?

350
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,750
Oh, this was the boat.

351
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:09,910
Oh, okay.

352
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:11,950
I have to get in this boat.

353
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:15,110
How the hell do I get on this boat?

354
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:16,650
Hello?

355
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:17,850
Oh, here.

356
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,710
I heard there's a gun here.

357
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:22,550
Thank you, backseaters.

358
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:24,930
Alright.

359
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:25,830
Gun?

360
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:27,750
No, that is...

361
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:29,110
Alexandrite.

362
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:29,770
Gun?

363
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:33,830
Dang, I can't believe I have to play the game.

364
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,470
Oh my god!

365
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,630
Where is the gun?

366
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,970
Did my backseaters lie to me?

367
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:43,970
Gun?

368
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:44,930
Oh, this must be gun.

369
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:46,730
Gun?

370
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,230
Is that the pistol?

371
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:52,670
Wait, is that a pistol?

372
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,350
Is that a better pistol?

373
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,070
Okay, red.

374
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,290
A powerful handgun.

375
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,650
It is burned to a grip to prevent the user from loading.

376
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:02,090
Wait, is that a better pistol?

377
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:03,890
Can I like attach this to...

378
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,470
Wait, where's the other?

379
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:06,330
Is this the...

380
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:07,050
Okay.

381
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:08,630
SG...

382
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:09,870
What is the SG?

383
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:10,790
Oh, this one.

384
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:13,290
Is that...

385
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:14,830
Does it use pistol ammo?

386
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:16,790
Strongest?

387
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:17,450
Okay, alright.

388
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:18,510
Well, goodbye.

389
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:19,610
We're gonna...

390
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:20,310
Oh.

391
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,850
Oh, I don't...

392
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,390
It only goes to that gun?

393
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:24,030
Okay.

394
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:26,790
Equipped.

395
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:30,010
Shortcut.

396
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:31,230
Bam.

397
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:33,150
How much ammo do I have?

398
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:34,730
Oh, it is.

399
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:35,990
But there's no...

400
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,590
There's no laser though.

401
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,150
Best damage for slow reload?

402
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,930
Okay, I'm gonna put this in the storage then.

403
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:44,250
Goodbye.

404
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:46,730
What was that quote?

405
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,270
I'm done playing with you.

406
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,140
I'm done playing with you.

407
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,360
Goodbye.

408
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,480
Wait, wait, wait.

409
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:02,940
Alright.

410
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,180
Let's see.

411
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,360
Uh...

412
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,740
Where do we go?

413
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,420
The Lakeside settlement.

414
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,160
Wait, what in the fuck is...

415
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,960
Door with Insignia.

416
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,560
Oh, there's so many things there.

417
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,340
Have I been here before?

418
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,540
What's over there?

419
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,700
There's a door with Insignia.

420
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,000
Oh, wait.

421
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,780
Is that the...

422
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,240
Oh my god.

423
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,600
There's a hidden area here too.

424
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:27,240
Okay, wait.

425
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,240
This is important.

426
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,100
I'm done with...

427
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:31,860
There's so much loot.

428
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,540
There is so much loot.

429
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,720
Thank god this is...

430
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,260
Thank god the sun is out.

431
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:37,460
Okay.

432
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,460
It's this way.

433
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,280
Right?

434
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,320
Yeah, it's this way.

435
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:43,920
It's over here.

436
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:47,040
I have to always tab to look at the map because I'm stupid.

437
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,520
Alright, here we go.

438
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:49,420
Yay!

439
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:49,520
I'm back.

440
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,640
Oh, there's chickens!

441
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,440
There's so many chickens.

442
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,360
Chicken, chicken, time to lay some egg.

443
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,480
Time to lay some golden eggs.

444
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:06,940
What's this?

445
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,600
Do I even have enough?

446
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,340
Okay, yeah, I do.

447
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,140
Alright.

448
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:11,680
Guys.

449
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,820
Guys, this is it.

450
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:13,980
This is your job.

451
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,180
To lay me some eggs.

452
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,320
Come on.

453
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,340
I can wait all day.

454
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:19,520
Okay.

455
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,940
I can just do super chat reading.

456
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,440
Come on, chickens.

457
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,020
I can just do super chat reading.

458
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,120
Oh, there we go.

459
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:29,860
Alright.

460
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,220
I don't need you anymore.

461
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,960
Oh my god, that's way too many eggs.

462
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,260
Give me a sec.

463
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,840
I'm done with all of you two.

464
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,100
No, it's a waste of bullets.

465
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:47,760
Okay.

466
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,280
Sorry.

467
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,800
That's actually a waste of bullets.

468
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,400
You're not worth my time.

469
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,600
Let's see.

470
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,840
How the fuck do I get over to this?

471
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:01,900
Oh, I have to go through here.

472
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:02,920
Okay.

473
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,180
Where the fuck is the merchant?

474
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,280
Merchant.

475
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,240
Oh, I have to...

476
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:06,980
Okay, I'm gonna...

477
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,840
I need to like...

478
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,640
Okay, you know what?

479
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:09,840
No.

480
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:13,060
I'm gonna go over here and grab some more treasures.

481
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,420
Treasure time.

482
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:16,800
What?

483
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,040
You don't eat chicken?

484
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,380
You can't say that.

485
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:19,520
You can't say that.

486
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:19,740
Okay.

487
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,000
Oh, wait, wait.

488
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,160
I don't even have to fucking...

489
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,060
Why do I even need to use my fucking thing?

490
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,680
I can just ram into it.

491
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,720
You can't say that unless you're vegan or vegetarian.

492
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,100
If you're neither of these, you can't say that.

493
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,900
Because you've eaten KFC before.

494
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,780
Don't think I don't know.

495
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:52,780
There you go.

496
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,020
Not that...

497
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:58,140
Where do you think fucking fried chicken comes from?

498
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:58,920
Chicken?

499
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:06,440
Where do you think fried chicken came from?

500
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,440
Is that Indiana Jones?

501
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,440
Okay.

502
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,840
Bro, it takes like 20 years to die.

503
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,240
All right.

504
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:20,720
Here you go.

505
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,720
Oh wait, I heard the reload.

506
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,040
It's like... Oh my god!

507
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,220
Oh my god!

508
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:26,640
The reload!

509
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:32,360
Okay, now I understand what you mean by the reload being like super low.

510
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:32,960
Shink!

511
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:33,800
Shink!

512
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:34,580
Shink!

513
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,360
Shink!

514
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,280
Shink!

515
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:36,920
Shink!

516
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:37,780
Shink!

517
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:38,540
Shink!

518
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:38,600
Shink!

519
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,320
Shink!

520
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,820
I fucked up the shink!

521
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:50,280
Guys, I fucked up the shink because I saw the thing and I was like I should press like...

522
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:58,360
I didn't realize it would take that... I didn't realize it would take that long to shink somebody.

523
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,560
That was... that was an oopsie there.

524
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,820
I would admit I might have messed up a little there.

525
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,800
There was a quick time prompt and I chose...

526
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,280
I chose to ignore it because I thought I would shink faster.

527
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,640
I thought I was faster than the quick time prompt.

528
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,540
Uh, light?

529
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,120
There we go.

530
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,160
I legitimately thought I was faster.

531
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,200
Oh man, there's definitely people here.

532
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,500
Oh man, I could feel it.

533
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,540
I'm gonna go in there later.

534
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:36,820
What?

535
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,100
What?

536
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,300
Can we go back to the lake when it's daytime?

537
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,840
Is that possible?

538
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,180
Do we come back here?

539
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,840
Do we come back here when it's daytime?

540
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,200
What's the point?

541
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,520
Why did they give the five gift shins thinking they hate you?

542
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,300
We don't?

543
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,700
That's fucked up.

544
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,340
That actually is fucked up, man.

545
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,440
That's...

546
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,460
That's fucked up, man.

547
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,980
I wish we came back here when it was daytime.

548
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,080
Alright, use.

549
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,860
There is no sun.

550
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,580
Sad.

551
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,820
I'm so sad.

552
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,800
We don't have space anymore?

553
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,800
I don't even...

554
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,520
Mike, thank you for that one gifted shin.

555
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:33,840
Thank you.

556
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:34,340
Thank you.

557
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,320
Okay.

558
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,120
Alright.

559
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,260
Let us...

560
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,420
We'll go... We'll do the...

561
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,100
Oh my god.

562
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,800
I don't wanna do the house, man.

563
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,360
Why...

564
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,340
Why is it so dark?

565
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,420
No...

566
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,440
There's people here.

567
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,140
There's no way a house like this is empty.

568
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:03,000
When there's so much loot.

569
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:10,260
There's no way... I refuse to believe this house is unoccupied.

570
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,600
Oh my god.

571
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,500
I don't have any keys.

572
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,320
Wait.

573
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,440
Is it even worth it?

574
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,720
I don't...

575
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:17,900
Oh my god.

576
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,180
Does this need a key?

577
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,420
This... Do I have the key for this?

578
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,640
It's just fish.

579
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:29,820
It's a fishing village.

580
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,020
Oh my god.

581
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:33,980
Oh...

582
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:34,300
Oh...

583
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,860
No key for that one?

584
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:39,920
Alright.

585
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,840
This does not look like an empty house.

586
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,920
This looks like a house...

587
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,260
Wait.

588
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:46,900
Have I already...

589
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:47,760
Yeah.

590
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,280
I've already fucking done that.

591
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:52,780
This looks like a house that's about to fucking gank me.

592
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,320
Hello?

593
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,300
Hello?

594
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,000
Hello?

595
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:00,920
Hello, guys?

596
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,280
Hello?

597
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,360
Hello?

598
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:03,860
Hello?

599
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,520
Hello?

600
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,080
Is this... Is this the photo?

601
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,400
Oh, this... I put that there.

602
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,480
Oh, I hate this.

603
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,840
I hate this so much!

604
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,060
I don't feel safe.

605
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,440
You say I'm safe, but I definitely do not feel safe.

606
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,100
Oh my god.

607
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:22,640
There's a ladder.

608
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:23,240
Bro.

609
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,360
How worth of it... How...

610
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,580
How worth it is it for me to go there?

611
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,560
Oh!

612
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,180
How worth it?

613
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,120
How worth?

614
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,500
How worth it?

615
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,300
It's so worth... Alright.

616
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,120
How much do you wanna bet?

617
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,060
Guys.

618
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,920
How much do you wanna bet this?

619
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,700
Of how worth this is?

620
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,260
Are you willing to bet?

621
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,000
Bet for it?

622
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:55,740
Alright.

623
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,580
I'm going in.

624
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:58,880
I'm going in.

625
00:26:58,940 --> 00:26:59,600
I'm running in.

626
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,340
I'm running in.

627
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:00,840
I don't care.

628
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:01,620
I'm running in.

629
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,060
I'm running in.

630
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:03,920
I'm running in.

631
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:04,620
I'm not looking.

632
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,400
I'm running in.

633
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,340
If I don't look...

634
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:06,540
Wait.

635
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:07,540
What?

636
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:08,880
Oh.

637
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,960
It was worth it.

638
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,320
That's money!

639
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:21,680
Three years ago, my beloved daughter passed away shortly after giving birth to a son.

640
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,120
Since then, the boy has grown considerably.

641
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,380
He's a very curious child and has a true thirst for knowledge.

642
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:32,260
He even tries to follow after me when I go out hunting.

643
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,960
I can't take my eyes off him for a second.

644
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:39,000
Whenever we walk in the forest, he always asks me to tell stories.

645
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,820
He's very fond of Don.

646
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:45,700
Although he's small, the boy is smart and observant beyond his years.

647
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,840
If he weren't stuck here, he might become a scholar.

648
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,900
I was a careless fool.

649
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,940
I could have sworn I shot clean through the wolf's head.

650
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,940
And yet, it lunged at me.

651
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:58,380
I was able to make it back to the cabin.

652
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:01,140
But my wound is swollen and discolored.

653
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:04,300
I cannot bear seeing the boy's worried eyes.

654
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,540
My body moves on its own.

655
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,520
Oh no!

656
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,680
He got infected by the bad wolves!

657
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,680
Oh no!

658
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:15,520
My boy moves on its own.

659
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,980
My body... Am I going mad?

660
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,120
I can't die now and leave the boy behind.

661
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,960
Dear God, please protect him.

662
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:22,960
Oh.

663
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,180
Bro...

664
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:25,960
I can't go back!

665
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,340
Oh my God!

666
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,800
Not the walk back!

667
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,700
Whose shoes are those?

668
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,180
Oh my God!

669
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:44,100
Not the walk back, please protect me!

670
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,560
I hate this.

671
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,620
Oh my God!

672
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,120
I fucking hate this house.

673
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,440
Put me back in the forest!

674
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,840
At least there's like sky.

675
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,300
You know?

676
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,680
At least the sky is out.

677
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,080
My paranoia.

678
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,160
It's rising.

679
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:12,100
Okay, here we go.

680
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:16,260
Missed opportunity for optional bikinis for Leon.

681
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,920
Modders, do you hear that?

682
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:24,980
To be fair, I don't think I've seen like a mod for like a naked Leon.

683
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,960
Like, you know, shirtless Leon.

684
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,260
Let me phrase that better.

685
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,200
A shirtless Leon.

686
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:32,180
I do not think I've ever seen a mod for it.

687
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:32,960
Alright.

688
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,820
Let's see.

689
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,940
I saw a lot of mods for Ashley though.

690
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,300
That's like...

691
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,760
Why do you not give us what we really want?

692
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,780
Shirtless Leon!

693
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,640
Where is my shirtless Leon?

694
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,520
Oh, wait.

695
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,560
I didn't open this before.

696
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,040
There is?

697
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,340
Oh my god, Link!

698
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:00,720
For scientific reasons.

699
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,540
For research purposes.

700
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,560
Wait, what is over here?

701
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:05,640
I've never been here before.

702
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,080
What would be here?

703
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,700
Guys, for research purposes.

704
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,900
I need to know what to look for.

705
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,380
Guys, it is clearly for research.

706
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:33,180
Can someone cast a gigantic fish that lives in the lake for me?

707
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:33,600
Wait.

708
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,160
Oh!

709
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,700
I just have to shoot it.

710
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:36,900
Sell it.

711
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,260
Wait, don't I have one?

712
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:43,280
Yeah, isn't that the... Oh, it's the Lunker Bass.

713
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,460
Okay, not the other one.

714
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:46,900
Wait, what's over here?

715
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:47,900
Oh, it's the Lunker Bass.

716
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,980
What the fuck is over here?

717
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,080
Ashley?

718
00:30:58,410 --> 00:30:59,610
Oh, that is not Ashley.

719
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:01,470
Oh, that is not Ashley.

720
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:03,410
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

721
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:05,590
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

722
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:07,650
What the hell is going on here?

723
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:09,390
What is this?

724
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:10,270
What is this?

725
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:11,790
Who are you?

726
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:14,710
You're not my hot topic, Ashley.

727
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:17,030
Oh, I don't like that.

728
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:17,950
I don't like that.

729
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:20,310
I don't really like that.

730
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:26,290
Wait, the mod is called shirtless Leon.

731
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:28,750
Wait, they actually have shirtless Leon?

732
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:30,230
Oh.

733
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:33,970
Guys, what if I...

734
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:36,290
I finally saved it.

735
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:40,570
I won't, guys.

736
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:41,430
Don't worry.

737
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:42,550
I won't do that.

738
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:46,530
I still want to be monetized, everybody.

739
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:49,230
I still want to be monetized.

740
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:51,930
What's up here, though?

741
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:55,910
What's up here?

742
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:58,490
I didn't even realize they actually do have it.

743
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:59,270
Those mad men.

744
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:01,350
Horse altar?

745
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,210
Wait, they're all women.

746
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:04,930
Is that what Ashley's for?

747
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:08,690
Oh, I don't like it.

748
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:10,170
I feel like I'm gonna get fucking...

749
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:11,430
I got key.

750
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:13,150
Oh, that must have been for the chest.

751
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:15,350
Oh my god.

752
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:18,490
Dude, I'm getting so paranoid from all of this.

753
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:22,070
I feel so much paranoia right now.

754
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:25,810
I don't feel safe.

755
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:28,890
Wait, where is that?

756
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:33,010
Wait, where is that?

757
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:36,790
I hear it, but where is it?

758
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:41,090
You hear that, right?

759
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:41,870
Where is it?

760
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:44,790
Where?

761
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:47,110
Where?

762
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:49,250
You hear that, right?

763
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:49,990
You hear the toy?

764
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:51,570
I swear I'm not fucking going crazy.

765
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:54,530
Oh, there!

766
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:55,670
There he is!

767
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:57,930
Oh yeah, there he is.

768
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,150
Oh my god, I just...

769
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:02,990
Why?

770
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:05,110
I'm so paranoid!

771
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:10,710
There's so much paranoia!

772
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:12,230
I feel...

773
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:14,050
I shouldn't feel this safe.

774
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:16,330
I don't feel safe at all.

775
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:19,930
D-Dragon, thank you for the super chat.

776
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:21,010
Thank you, thank you.

777
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:25,810
Shoutout to the Trampstab Leon mod and to the Redacted mod too.

778
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:26,650
Thank you!

779
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:30,050
Why do you know so much about that, D-Dragon?

780
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,730
Why do you know that?

781
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:32,950
Huh?

782
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:38,470
Hmm...

783
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:41,650
You know, when I was researching mods...

784
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:44,130
Those were definitely not downloaded a lot.

785
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:49,310
Hmmm...

786
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,750
Oh no!

787
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,970
It's the evil wolf!

788
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:56,410
It's super evil wolf!

789
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:01,880
Is evil wolf dead?

790
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,920
Oh no.

791
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,580
Super wolves...

792
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,320
Super wolves...

793
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:10,720
I'm not ready for super wolves!

794
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:13,960
I'm not ready for super wolves!

795
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,620
Isn't that super?

796
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,940
Oh, what the fuck?

797
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,820
They're working together!

798
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:29,820
Oh shit.

799
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,760
Oh, fuck!

800
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:33,420
Okay, that's on me.

801
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,000
All right.

802
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,940
Okay, how the fuck do I miss that, though?

803
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:44,640
Like ohhhhh Okay, I'm just gonna use my shotgun, fuck this.

804
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,380
This is like way too much work.

805
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,180
Alright, come over here, come over here.

806
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:54,240
BOOM!

807
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,080
Nice, okay.

808
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,280
Alright.

809
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:01,020
Okay, I did not like Super Wolf.

810
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:05,580
I did not like Super Wolf at all.

811
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:12,080
Super Wolf did not make me comfortable.

812
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,620
Alright, let's craft some more shotgun shells here.

813
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,680
Alright, nice.

814
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,300
Uhh...

815
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,980
We'll just eat an egg.

816
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,220
We have so many eggs.

817
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,000
Thank you, Super Chat.

818
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:24,820
Thank you, thank you.

819
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,380
Your face is so smug.

820
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:29,240
Can't decide if I want to protect you or bully you.

821
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,820
Good job, Boat Babysitting.

822
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,720
Thank you, Super Chat.

823
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:33,660
Thank you, thank you.

824
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:36,580
Jesus Christ, not Super Wolf.

825
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,100
Uh, where is here?

826
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,920
Is this important?

827
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,160
I guess we're treasure?

828
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,720
Oh, there's a typewriter there.

829
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:46,660
Oh, there's a typewriter there.

830
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,700
Like, how important is here?

831
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,080
How... how important is here?

832
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,280
Not yet?

833
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,240
Oh, thank God.

834
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,500
Okay, I guess we leave.

835
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,600
I guess we're fine.

836
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,180
We already killed Super Wolves.

837
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,360
Oh, we have to unlock this chest though.

838
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:09,810
Turn on your light.

839
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:10,810
There we go.

840
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:12,290
Thank you, Leon.

841
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:16,660
Alright.

842
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,240
You should have the key now for this.

843
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,960
What is it?

844
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,260
Ah, gold bar.

845
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,520
Nice.

846
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,020
There's so much money.

847
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,660
I like money.

848
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,140
Just like Mr. Krabs, my Oshie.

849
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,340
Alright, here we go.

850
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,920
You'll be around back to the village eventually?

851
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:42,100
What are you... you guys just told me I would never be back here!

852
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,800
That's why I fucking went here!

853
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:48,160
That's the only reason why I went there.

854
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,440
Because you guys said it wouldn't be important.

855
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,660
Can't believe it.

856
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,900
Would this be important?

857
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:02,520
Guys, is this entrance important enough, guys?

858
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,180
I need to know!

859
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,320
It's complicated.

860
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:13,540
Is this entrance important?

861
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:14,740
Yes?

862
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:19,440
Okay, now I'm feeling... do it for the money?

863
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,820
Okay, but how much money though?

864
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:22,380
Like...

865
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,400
Like, is it worth the ammo?

866
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:31,880
Like here.

867
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,000
Right here.

868
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:35,860
Is it worth the ammo for this?

869
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,880
Well, I mean I could like fucking...

870
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,360
Boop.

871
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:39,240
Boop.

872
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:39,940
Alright.

873
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,340
Oh, hey, there's a lot of money.

874
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,140
Hey, there is money.

875
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:43,840
Boop.

876
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,280
Boop.

877
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:45,280
Boop.

878
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:46,900
Boop.

879
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,360
I think I'm gonna die in this cave.

880
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,820
Bro, I feel like I'm just gonna fucking die in this cave.

881
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,900
Oh, hey, look!

882
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,620
There is money!

883
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:57,780
Look at that!

884
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:58,820
All the money!

885
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,820
Oh, but I could open here!

886
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,700
But there is a typewriter here.

887
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:06,260
Maybe I should just go for the typewriter here.

888
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,260
Oh my god, I...

889
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:13,580
Oh my god, do not feel safe in here.

890
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:17,580
I feel like this cave is just gonna collapse.

891
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,620
This is like a bait cave.

892
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,420
This does not feel like the safe cave.

893
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,260
It feels like the bait cave.

894
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,020
Okay.

895
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,920
Oh, there is a place for me to dock my boat.

896
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,780
Is this the one with the gators?

897
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,560
What do you mean by that?

898
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,200
What the fuck?

899
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,260
Excuse me?

900
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,660
What do you mean?

901
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,600
Is this the one with the gators?

902
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,440
There is crocodiles now?

903
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:49,940
Or alligators?

904
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,140
I don't fucking care.

905
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,660
They are basically the same thing.

906
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,780
Oh my god, man.

907
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,660
Don't worry about it.

908
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,120
Gators in Europe?

909
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,160
Oh my god, true.

910
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,140
What the fuck?

911
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,080
How are you here?

912
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,240
Who brought you here?

913
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,420
Are you an invasive species?

914
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,520
Alright.

915
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:14,640
I'm gonna go to the other side.

916
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:14,880
Alright, nice.

917
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,300
Okay.

918
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,600
Did I grab all the treasure?

919
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,220
I did.

920
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:20,020
Alright, then I fucking...

921
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:22,280
just ride back to over here.

922
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,140
Oh, I saw that treasure over here too.

923
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,900
Oh no, they've escaped from the zoo.

924
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,600
Oh no.

925
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,700
Bro, I haven't made any progress on the story.

926
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:34,920
I've just been looting, man.

927
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,760
I've made zero progress from this.

928
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,780
This is why I started this early today.

929
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:42,900
Thank you.

930
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,100
I've just been looting.

931
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:48,880
Treasure over Ashley.

932
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,340
I still have yet to fucking find Ashley.

933
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,100
This whole game is about protecting Ashley.

934
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,480
And I'm definitely not doing my job.

935
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,500
Alright, here we go.

936
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:04,740
Like, the president purposely hired me to save Ashley.

937
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,600
But I'm just here looting.

938
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,800
Alright, nice.

939
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:10,980
I am...

940
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:11,640
Nice!

941
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,660
Wait.

942
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,460
There is a chest here, right?

943
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,700
That can open.

944
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,740
Can I open this now?

945
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,160
No, I don't have the key.

946
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:18,960
God damn it.

947
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:19,940
Alright, sir.

948
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,340
I got the golden egg!

949
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,040
Sounding like you're the super chat.

950
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:25,380
Thank you.

951
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,280
Gator, I hardly know her.

952
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:28,340
Thank you for the super chat.

953
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:28,700
Thank you.

954
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:29,160
Thank you.

955
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:30,840
Alright.

956
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,400
I got something new for you.

957
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:33,560
I got you that...

958
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,400
What the fuck?

959
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,680
Okay, that's a lot of shit.

960
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,480
That's a lot of shit.

961
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:40,980
Okay, let me give you the golden chicken egg first.

962
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,180
This is what I'm talking about.

963
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:42,980
Nice.

964
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,320
Fine work.

965
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,460
Where would it...

966
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,200
You're right.

967
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,500
She's probably fine.

968
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:48,520
Come back.

969
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:51,060
She's probably okay, guys.

970
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:54,020
I don't know why you guys are so worried.

971
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:55,820
Probably okay.

972
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,360
Okay, what's the matchup?

973
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,300
1.2 for different colors.

974
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,560
Okay, I have different colors.

975
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:04,920
Boop.

976
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,060
Boop.

977
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:07,980
Alright, nice.

978
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,680
Now you're more pretty.

979
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,680
Alright.

980
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,200
Cool.

981
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,160
Elegant headdress.

982
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:12,600
Okay.

983
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,460
Wait, can I not...

984
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,920
Can I put you...

985
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,020
Yeah, let me put stones in you.

986
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:21,260
Excuse you.

987
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:21,840
Excuse me?

988
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:22,600
Let me...

989
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:25,900
Are that not stones?

990
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,780
Oh, they're not.

991
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:27,640
I thought...

992
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:30,600
Every time I see a circle, I think stone.

993
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:34,360
I was like, I can put stones in you.

994
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,320
Alright, there's not...

995
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,620
It looks like it had it.

996
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,860
Okay, I can sell this key now.

997
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,140
Okay.

998
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,320
And then I'll sell...

999
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,300
Oh my god, 12,000.

1000
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,640
I'm fucking rich.

1001
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,780
Okay, and then I'll sell this and I'll sell...

1002
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,780
Oh my god, 19,000?

1003
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,480
Guys, don't talk to me.

1004
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:52,780
I'm...

1005
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:56,440
Don't talk to me unless you have a splendid bangle.

1006
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:01,880
Okay.

1007
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,400
Alright, we can sell all of this.

1008
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:05,800
Nice.

1009
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:06,060
Okay.

1010
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:07,060
Boop.

1011
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,420
Oh my god!

1012
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:11,640
93,000.

1013
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:12,680
This is good.

1014
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,980
Okay, we can get rid of...

1015
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:17,880
Wait, can I get rid of my normal pistol now?

1016
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:22,040
That money changed you.

1017
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,680
Do I sell the...

1018
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,140
Yeah, I can sell the SG.

1019
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:30,980
Goodbye.

1020
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,220
You're never coming back to me.

1021
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:34,780
Alright, here you go.

1022
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:35,800
Yeah, this one.

1023
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:36,440
Okay, yeah.

1024
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,280
Alright, I'll sell it.

1025
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,260
Nice.

1026
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:38,640
Alright.

1027
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:42,020
Now I can just upgrade my new baby.

1028
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:42,740
Okay.

1029
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:45,080
How much is my durability right now?

1030
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:49,140
You know, I have so much money.

1031
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:50,120
I don't even care.

1032
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,780
Alright, where is...

1033
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,840
Where is my new baby?

1034
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:54,360
Here you go.

1035
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:54,940
Power.

1036
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:55,420
Yes.

1037
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,400
Okay, I heard the reload.

1038
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,360
I need to up the reload speed, right?

1039
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,840
Jesus, lonely clothes.

1040
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:03,200
To the sun.

1041
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:04,780
Okay, I can...

1042
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:08,400
I'm going to get the reload speed because the reload speed for this is dog shit now.

1043
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:08,620
Okay.

1044
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:09,000
Yeah.

1045
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:09,260
Okay.

1046
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:09,520
Alright.

1047
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:09,540
Alright, nice.

1048
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:10,040
Alright.

1049
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:10,820
And then...

1050
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:11,700
What else?

1051
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:13,160
Uh...

1052
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:14,740
You know what?

1053
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:15,380
What else?

1054
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:19,760
I have 81,000 I can do whatever the fuck...

1055
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,680
No, I'm going to do the power for the knife too.

1056
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:22,680
I'm so rich!

1057
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:23,820
It doesn't matter!

1058
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,260
I have so much load!

1059
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:26,820
Oh, I should sell the...

1060
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,660
I should sell the laser sight.

1061
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,500
Which one is the laser sight?

1062
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:33,260
Is it this one?

1063
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:34,960
It's this one, right?

1064
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:38,540
Uh...

1065
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:38,600
What?

1066
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:40,420
Is this one right?

1067
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,460
Yeah, this is for the SG and the Punisher.

1068
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,020
Wait, I have one for Punisher.

1069
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:46,900
Is the Punisher better?

1070
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:49,440
Or is my current gun better?

1071
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:50,140
Chat.

1072
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,180
Is the Punisher or this one better?

1073
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:55,440
Don't store it?

1074
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:56,640
We need...

1075
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,440
Power is always a safe bet for it.

1076
00:43:59,560 --> 00:43:59,960
No?

1077
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:01,500
No you don't...

1078
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:02,960
Punisher sucks?

1079
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:03,920
Okay, wait.

1080
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:04,840
Oh my gosh, wait what?

1081
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,080
What are these?

1082
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,420
Leon with shotgun?

1083
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:08,540
I can sell my... Oh!

1084
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:09,660
I was gonna say!

1085
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,320
I can sell myself?

1086
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:12,520
But that's the charm.

1087
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:18,080
Okay, I'll sell the laser sight.

1088
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:19,520
Okay, I'm gonna sell it then.

1089
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:20,280
I'm gonna do it!

1090
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,660
I'm gonna do it!

1091
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:24,540
I'm selling it!

1092
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:25,460
You know what?

1093
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:26,080
It's alright.

1094
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:29,700
We have a lot of... We have so much money.

1095
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:30,880
Okay, well let me see.

1096
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,300
Oh, case upgrade!

1097
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:33,100
We need that.

1098
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:33,800
Okay.

1099
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:34,600
Is that everything?

1100
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:37,140
Well, let's attach... We don't need it.

1101
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:37,920
What?

1102
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:38,720
It's okay.

1103
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,020
We don't need fucking grenades.

1104
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:42,960
All we need is our...

1105
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,000
Our fucking guns.

1106
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,460
Like, we're not gonna take the cheap route with nades.

1107
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,560
Also, I'm pretty sure I'm gonna nade myself anyways.

1108
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:50,820
So I'm gonna...

1109
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:52,980
I'm like...

1110
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:54,840
I lowkey think...

1111
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:57,440
I am definitely gonna like...

1112
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,000
Accidentally grenade myself.

1113
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,140
So I don't think I should...

1114
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:01,400
Hahaha!

1115
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:03,320
Hahaha!

1116
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:05,860
Flash grenade?

1117
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,040
Oh, alright.

1118
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:07,400
What do I add?

1119
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:07,700
Ah, okay.

1120
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:08,180
I'll buy it.

1121
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:08,840
I have so much money.

1122
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,220
I can waste money right now.

1123
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:12,680
I can like... Okay.

1124
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:14,920
I'm gonna upgrade the power.

1125
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,680
Will I ever... Will I ever get a better gr...

1126
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:18,640
Pista.

1127
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,820
Will I ever get a better Pista?

1128
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:23,780
Guys.

1129
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:26,820
If not, I will...

1130
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:27,240
Hahaha!

1131
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:28,320
No?

1132
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:29,940
Is this the best Pista?

1133
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:31,420
I'm gonna get?

1134
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:33,300
Yes?

1135
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:34,200
Okay.

1136
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:35,740
Alright.

1137
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:37,660
I'm gonna all in.

1138
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:39,360
All in!

1139
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,380
All fucking in!

1140
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,000
And I might as well get the reload speed.

1141
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:45,460
Cause the reload speed is fucking slow.

1142
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:46,360
Alright, now I'm poor.

1143
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:48,440
Guys, now you can talk to me again.

1144
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:48,940
Hahaha!

1145
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:50,860
Hahaha!

1146
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:53,700
Unless you have that bangle.

1147
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,260
Unless you have the bangle.

1148
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:57,520
Hahaha!

1149
00:45:59,380 --> 00:45:59,900
Hahaha!

1150
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:01,500
Okay.

1151
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:03,220
Uhhhhhhh.

1152
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:07,640
Why the fuck would I want like a different case color?

1153
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:08,840
Like what?

1154
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,000
Hahaha!

1155
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:10,820
Hahaha!

1156
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:14,240
I'm just like you guys.

1157
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,800
I'm one of the people.

1158
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:17,560
Hahaha!

1159
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,260
I'm one of the people now!

1160
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:21,220
Where the fuck is the typewriter?

1161
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,560
Oh, there you go.

1162
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:25,840
Nice.

1163
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:28,400
Oh, there's a buff?

1164
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:29,660
Wait, what?

1165
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:30,820
Where's the buff?

1166
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:31,800
Oh!

1167
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,380
Increases the drop.

1168
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:34,180
Wait, what?

1169
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,220
Wait, do I buy it?

1170
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:38,880
Aesthetic.

1171
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:38,980
Aesthetic.

1172
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,220
Wait, what's the white one?

1173
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:42,260
What does the white one do?

1174
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:45,480
What does the white case do?

1175
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:47,700
How would I know?

1176
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:50,920
How do I know what the fuck the white case does?

1177
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:54,800
How do I know what the fuck the white case does?

1178
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:55,860
The case or the stock?

1179
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:56,880
Don't buy it?

1180
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,280
I was like, buy it!

1181
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,080
Don't buy it.

1182
00:46:59,260 --> 00:46:59,440
Hahaha!

1183
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:03,320
But what does the white case do?

1184
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:04,800
I'm so curious.

1185
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:08,460
What does it do?

1186
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:09,900
What does it do?

1187
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:12,620
Oh, increased drop rate for handguns!

1188
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:12,900
Oh, increased drop rate for handguns!

1189
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:13,820
Okay, no, the ammo is better.

1190
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:15,280
The ammo is much better.

1191
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:16,000
What the fuck?

1192
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:17,840
Of course I would pick the ammo.

1193
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:22,920
Yeah, the ammo is better than this.

1194
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:25,080
Cass, thank you for the super chat.

1195
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:25,740
Thank you, thank you.

1196
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:28,100
Are you saying we have no trash?

1197
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:29,340
Hahaha!

1198
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,340
Okay, I saved already.

1199
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:32,460
Alright, uh...

1200
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:34,060
I wanna go here.

1201
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:35,380
There must be like stuff here too.

1202
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:38,020
So...

1203
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:39,080
Alright, nice.

1204
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:41,120
My fucking... I'm so kinky now.

1205
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:42,480
Am I going the right way?

1206
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:42,900
I am.

1207
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:43,920
Okay, that's good.

1208
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,260
I always need to know if I'm going the right way.

1209
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:47,800
God, this...

1210
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:50,160
They do this ambient so well.

1211
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,220
I'm like super fucking paranoid.

1212
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:53,540
Every time.

1213
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:58,980
Everywhere I go, I'm thinking, Am I gonna die here?

1214
00:47:59,340 --> 00:47:59,940
Am I?

1215
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:00,700
Hahaha!

1216
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:04,540
Hahaha!

1217
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,360
Thank you for the super chat.

1218
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,240
Thank you, thank you.

1219
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:07,860
You mean Leon?

1220
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,180
Yeah, search up the...

1221
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:11,000
Search up Leon inflation.

1222
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,840
Oh wait, this is where I was.

1223
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,940
I don't have any...

1224
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:21,540
Uh... I don't have this though.

1225
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:23,220
Hahaha!

1226
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:25,900
Hahaha!

1227
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,380
Alright, let's see.

1228
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:29,800
Yeah.

1229
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:31,800
Here we go.

1230
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:36,580
Wow, I'm not telling you guys to search it up.

1231
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,140
I'm talking about that one guy.

1232
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:39,720
Hahaha!

1233
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,800
I know what you're into.

1234
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:43,720
Hahaha!

1235
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:44,940
Hahaha!

1236
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:46,280
Hahaha!

1237
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:49,540
Okay, let's see.

1238
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:51,620
Mural... I need to go here.

1239
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:52,480
Mural cave.

1240
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:54,580
I need to go here.

1241
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:57,320
And also... yeah, this one.

1242
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:00,540
Alright, there you go.

1243
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:01,320
Alright, there you go.

1244
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:03,920
Get the bass?

1245
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:05,020
Where is that?

1246
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:06,640
Okay, where's the...

1247
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,480
Alright, we'll get that later.

1248
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:09,880
That's not important, guys!

1249
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:13,820
Let's see.

1250
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:16,460
We have to go to...

1251
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:18,900
this area to get the location.

1252
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,060
There has to be people in there.

1253
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:22,040
Hahaha!

1254
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,140
Oh shit!

1255
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:23,780
Sorry.

1256
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:24,860
Hahaha!

1257
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:28,020
I was too busy looking at my chat.

1258
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:29,000
Hahaha!

1259
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:29,300
Hahaha!

1260
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,080
Alright, here we go.

1261
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:35,420
Let's see.

1262
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:38,440
Is this it?

1263
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:39,560
Yeah, this is it.

1264
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:43,120
Hahaha!

1265
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,480
We're actually thinking about the super chat that you think.

1266
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:49,420
Which way?

1267
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:50,020
Okay.

1268
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,560
I mean, obviously it can't be that easy, right?

1269
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:56,940
Yeah, I fucking knew it.

1270
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,580
I was like, there's no way it's that easy.

1271
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,980
It never makes things easy for you.

1272
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:01,460
Hahaha!

1273
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:03,220
Alright, let's see.

1274
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,600
Oh no, not the whispers!

1275
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:11,440
Oh, okay.

1276
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:12,260
It's just this guy.

1277
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,080
Give me a sec, I'm reloading.

1278
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:18,920
Okay, give me a sec.

1279
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:20,020
Wait, where are you going?

1280
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:21,980
Where... Okay.

1281
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:22,400
Hahaha!

1282
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:23,840
I was like, where are you going?

1283
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:26,720
Alright, here you go.

1284
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:28,780
Nice.

1285
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:32,060
Is there more people coming over?

1286
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:32,620
No?

1287
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,660
Okay, I need to go see if there's loot here.

1288
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:38,280
Wait, oh there is loot!

1289
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:39,480
Nice, I fucking knew it.

1290
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:42,580
Every time there's a little hole, there's loot.

1291
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:44,220
Nice money!

1292
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:47,860
I'll never be as rich as I was before.

1293
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,140
I felt so strong.

1294
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:52,200
Oh no!

1295
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:52,940
Oh no!

1296
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:54,660
Please, am I fast enough?

1297
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:56,300
No!

1298
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,520
I was too... No, I was fast enough!

1299
00:50:57,740 --> 00:50:59,020
I was not fast enough!

1300
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:01,360
Okay.

1301
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:02,840
No, my shotgun!

1302
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:06,600
I was not fast enough, guys!

1303
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,020
Alright, nice.

1304
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:11,140
I will be fast enough.

1305
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:11,840
I will be fast enough.

1306
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:13,060
Okay, I'm fast enough this time.

1307
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:13,700
Guys.

1308
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:17,640
I'm never fast enough.

1309
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:19,820
Hello?

1310
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:23,360
Alright.

1311
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:25,600
Nice.

1312
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:26,040
Mayday?

1313
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:27,180
Oh, not nice.

1314
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:28,240
Not nice.

1315
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,880
That is a fucking bomb!

1316
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:32,520
I didn't have time to shoot it!

1317
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:34,300
It's okay.

1318
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,160
We're fine here.

1319
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:37,520
Nice.

1320
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:39,340
Oh, nice!

1321
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:40,200
They're burning themselves!

1322
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:41,320
Yay!

1323
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,200
More time to reload!

1324
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:49,260
What?

1325
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:50,460
What the fuck?

1326
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:52,140
Oh, fuck!

1327
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:52,640
Okay.

1328
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:54,220
Alright.

1329
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,860
We're just gonna get you out of here.

1330
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:58,940
Oh my god.

1331
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:01,540
Please tell me you guys have more ammo later on.

1332
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:06,300
My ammo resources is not good right now.

1333
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:08,340
Wait.

1334
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,620
Did he like, blew himself up?

1335
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:11,620
That's really convenient.

1336
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:13,300
Wait.

1337
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:15,060
What happened to that one guy throwing bombs?

1338
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:17,540
God.

1339
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:18,920
God, I hate that ambience.

1340
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:20,320
Alright.

1341
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,520
We need more...

1342
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:24,780
We always need more shotgun, man.

1343
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:27,200
We always need more shotgun.

1344
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:28,120
No!

1345
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:29,580
We don't have enough!

1346
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:31,640
Okay.

1347
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:33,060
We gotta need five more.

1348
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:34,300
Okay.

1349
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:35,380
Nice.

1350
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:38,240
Alright.

1351
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:38,820
Here we go.

1352
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:40,940
Let's see.

1353
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:43,360
Hello?

1354
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:45,640
Boop!

1355
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:47,120
Oh, wait.

1356
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:47,600
Is that it?

1357
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:49,300
No.

1358
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:49,900
Oh my god!

1359
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:50,900
I don't need rifle ammo!

1360
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:53,780
Hello?

1361
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:56,840
Thank you for the super chat.

1362
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:57,300
Thank you.

1363
00:52:58,460 --> 00:52:58,860
Hello?

1364
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:00,720
Okay.

1365
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,000
What do I need to do?

1366
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:02,880
Alright.

1367
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:03,840
There's treasure here.

1368
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:05,620
And then there's a shrine here.

1369
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:07,360
Okay.

1370
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:08,500
Where do I go?

1371
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:10,300
Is this a rifle?

1372
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:10,720
No!

1373
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:11,780
This is a waste.

1374
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,420
Rifle is for bosses only.

1375
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,680
These guys are too small.

1376
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:18,700
These guys are not worth it.

1377
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:20,460
Are you... Are they a boss?

1378
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:20,760
No!

1379
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:23,660
I am trying to set a presidency here.

1380
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:24,360
Okay?

1381
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:26,100
They need to know their worth.

1382
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:28,080
And they are not worth rifles.

1383
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,660
They are not... They are... Dude, dude!

1384
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,120
They are not worth rifle privileges!

1385
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,540
Not everybody deserves to be a rifle!

1386
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:46,280
What the fuck?

1387
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:49,420
What?

1388
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:51,260
Oh shit!

1389
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:51,980
There he is!

1390
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:53,260
I was like, what?

1391
00:53:57,670 --> 00:53:59,110
I'm so... Oh!

1392
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:00,050
What the fuck!

1393
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:01,030
Where did you get here?

1394
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:04,930
Oh god.

1395
00:54:04,970 --> 00:54:05,590
I don't like this.

1396
00:54:05,590 --> 00:54:06,130
Oh!

1397
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:11,090
I don't like this.

1398
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:13,690
I don't like this!

1399
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:17,610
Mr. Gremlin!

1400
00:54:18,350 --> 00:54:19,450
Oh wait, I need to reload.

1401
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:28,520
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1402
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:29,360
Don't!

1403
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:29,760
Do not!

1404
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:31,240
Okay.

1405
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:31,640
Finally.

1406
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,160
I only have one ammo.

1407
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:35,820
One bullet.

1408
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:38,120
One bullet and a dream.

1409
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,160
Wait, is he dead?

1410
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:42,800
Oh my god.

1411
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:44,940
I hear so many things going on around me.

1412
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:46,720
There's way too many sounds.

1413
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,420
There's way too... Oh shit!

1414
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:50,820
Okay!

1415
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:53,380
Okay, there you go.

1416
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:56,940
There's way too many sounds going on.

1417
00:54:59,340 --> 00:54:59,980
Oh, okay.

1418
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:00,420
Thank god.

1419
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:01,540
Please be handgun ammo.

1420
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:02,320
Please be...

1421
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:02,520
Nice!

1422
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:04,720
Nice, okay.

1423
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,100
Where the fuck am I?

1424
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:09,360
What the fuck?

1425
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:11,940
Okay.

1426
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:12,740
We're okay.

1427
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:14,380
We're okay.

1428
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,660
We don't stealth in here.

1429
00:55:20,110 --> 00:55:21,710
Okay, can't go anywhere here.

1430
00:55:22,670 --> 00:55:23,010
Oh!

1431
00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:23,870
Oh, nice.

1432
00:55:26,330 --> 00:55:27,290
Alright, nice.

1433
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:30,910
Okay, there's no such thing as stealth here in this neighborhood.

1434
00:55:31,470 --> 00:55:33,630
How the fuck do I get to this side?

1435
00:55:35,470 --> 00:55:36,570
Why is there...

1436
00:55:36,570 --> 00:55:38,250
Why did they paint it yellow?

1437
00:55:38,590 --> 00:55:39,610
I'm too stupid.

1438
00:55:39,810 --> 00:55:41,250
Why did they paint...

1439
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:44,410
What does this mean?

1440
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:47,090
I can't kick this!

1441
00:55:48,350 --> 00:55:49,910
The boxes were yellow!

1442
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:51,210
That meant kick!

1443
00:55:51,730 --> 00:55:52,750
This is yellow!

1444
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:54,070
What does this mean?

1445
00:55:57,210 --> 00:56:01,220
It's what it means!

1446
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:03,460
Okay, I know what it means now.

1447
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:05,840
Alright, this line and this line.

1448
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:06,620
Okay.

1449
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:08,880
Guys, I figured it out.

1450
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:10,260
I know what it means now.

1451
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,600
I figured it out.

1452
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:15,620
I realized it was a puzzle.

1453
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:17,500
I realized it was a puzzle.

1454
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:18,100
Oh my god!

1455
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:20,340
What the fuck is this stupid ass puzzle?

1456
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:23,640
What the fuck is this stupid ass puzzle?

1457
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:26,260
Look, I didn't look left, okay?

1458
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:29,040
I didn't see there was a button right here.

1459
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:29,700
I didn't see there was a button right here.

1460
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:32,180
I mean, how many times do I have to press this?

1461
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:34,000
Oh, three!

1462
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,080
There's three buttons?

1463
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:38,900
Okay, this, this...

1464
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:40,480
Okay, this, this...

1465
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:42,900
This, this...

1466
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:43,860
This...

1467
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:44,640
Okay, clear them.

1468
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:45,680
Does it come in order?

1469
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,740
Guys, is there an order to these buttons?

1470
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:53,960
What could the buttons mean?

1471
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:55,380
Okay.

1472
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:56,720
There's like that.

1473
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:57,120
Alright.

1474
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:03,300
I know there's like one more guy.

1475
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:04,260
There he is.

1476
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:05,000
There he is lurking.

1477
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:06,980
I knew you were still alive.

1478
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:09,520
Nice.

1479
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:10,740
That's fine.

1480
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:13,540
I know like it might be a little waste of a bullet.

1481
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:14,800
But it...

1482
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:14,980
No!

1483
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:16,740
He's too far from... No!

1484
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,360
He was too far!

1485
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:21,860
There you go.

1486
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:24,640
Nice.

1487
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:26,060
That has to be the last one.

1488
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:30,460
The order is no ice action.

1489
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:31,520
Back that view.

1490
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:32,720
Fuck off.

1491
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:38,320
Alright, let's see.

1492
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:40,320
I only found two of these.

1493
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:42,500
Oh, there's more loot.

1494
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:44,400
There's more loot.

1495
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:45,540
I love loot.

1496
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:47,560
I love loot.

1497
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:48,700
Nice.

1498
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:50,840
Loot's my favorite.

1499
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:53,020
Mehdi, what could the puzzle symbols mean?

1500
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:55,780
Thank you for the super chat.

1501
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:56,280
Thank you.

1502
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:57,700
Wow!

1503
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:01,320
Nice.

1504
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:02,620
Woo!

1505
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:05,340
You know what?

1506
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:05,760
Bye.

1507
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:10,220
If you live through this, I'll let you be rifled.

1508
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,780
I'll let you be rifled.

1509
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:13,040
Wait!

1510
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:14,360
Shit!

1511
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:17,420
I didn't see him behind me.

1512
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:18,560
Okay.

1513
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:23,800
Okay, I was like, I heard something behind me, but I was like, no.

1514
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:26,660
There's no way.

1515
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,480
I was like, wait a minute.

1516
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:33,600
Okay, but look at those reflexes though.

1517
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:37,440
Those were some sick ass reflexes.

1518
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:42,900
You have to admit.

1519
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:46,140
Those reflexes were pretty sick.

1520
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:49,500
Alright.

1521
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:50,040
Oh!

1522
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:50,920
Circle!

1523
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:51,840
Circle!

1524
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:53,680
Circle!

1525
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,380
And then...

1526
00:58:57,780 --> 00:58:58,540
Circle!

1527
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,040
And then that!

1528
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:02,120
And then...

1529
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:05,080
That was like two sides together.

1530
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:05,580
Okay.

1531
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:07,140
Circle!

1532
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:11,340
It was like...

1533
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:13,520
Circle!

1534
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:14,180
It was like...

1535
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:14,980
Circle!

1536
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:16,840
This!

1537
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:18,960
Okay, it was not that.

1538
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:21,200
What the fuck is it over there?

1539
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:22,080
What is this?

1540
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:23,640
What the fuck is this?

1541
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:25,380
What is this?

1542
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:26,560
This is also circle.

1543
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:28,400
This is...

1544
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:31,300
Oh my god, I cannot remember the symbols on the top of my head.

1545
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:32,140
What?

1546
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:39,160
Every time I look at it, I forgot what it looks like.

1547
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:39,300
Like...

1548
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:41,080
Okay.

1549
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:44,440
Double circle!

1550
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:46,420
And then...

1551
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:46,780
Wait, no?

1552
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:48,080
This circle?

1553
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:49,560
This circle.

1554
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:51,660
And then this circle.

1555
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:52,640
And then this?

1556
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:53,580
No.

1557
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:55,120
It's one of these circles!

1558
00:59:56,200 --> 01:00:01,300
It's one of these circles!

1559
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:03,560
Okay, it's not that circle.

1560
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:04,760
Maybe it's this circle.

1561
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:07,180
I can't remember the circles!

1562
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:08,580
I already forgot the circles!

1563
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:11,000
I know it's a circle!

1564
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:14,180
I know it's a circle!

1565
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:14,380
Maybe this?

1566
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:16,080
Okay, it's not that circle.

1567
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:17,300
Maybe it's this circle.

1568
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:19,380
Is it this circle?

1569
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:22,620
Was it that circle?

1570
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:28,760
Yeah!

1571
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:29,700
I got it!

1572
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:32,120
I knew it was one of the circles.

1573
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:34,460
I fucking knew it!

1574
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:35,540
God, I'm so smart!

1575
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:36,480
Yay!

1576
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:41,820
Guys!

1577
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:43,320
I knew it was circle!

1578
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:46,060
I just can't remember which circle!

1579
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:47,740
I can't remember!

1580
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:49,480
I can't remember!

1581
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:50,740
First try!

1582
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:53,580
First try!

1583
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:55,100
First try!

1584
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:56,120
I did it!

1585
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:59,140
Wait, there's more people?

1586
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:00,420
Where did you come from?

1587
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:00,840
Where did you come from?

1588
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:03,660
Why are you still here?

1589
01:01:07,060 --> 01:01:08,660
What the fuck?

1590
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:09,780
Woah!

1591
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:10,560
Shit!

1592
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:13,100
Where did those people come from?

1593
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:19,260
Will it blow up?

1594
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:19,960
Did he light it?

1595
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:25,000
Yeah, I was gonna say.

1596
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:25,840
You should be dead.

1597
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:29,980
Where did you come from?

1598
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:33,040
Alright.

1599
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:33,820
Loot!

1600
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:35,440
Nice.

1601
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:39,040
Alright, are there any more surprise people?

1602
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:41,360
Are there any more?

1603
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:42,700
Thank you for the super chat!

1604
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:43,020
Thank you!

1605
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:43,560
Thank you!

1606
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:46,060
Doki has a unique way of pronouncing circle.

1607
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:47,140
It's pretty cute.

1608
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:48,320
Thank you for the super chat.

1609
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:48,700
Thank you!

1610
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:49,060
Thank you!

1611
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:50,340
It's called the Doki accent.

1612
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:51,720
The Doki scent.

1613
01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:04,240
It's called never really growing up around the world that you fucking absorb every accent possible.

1614
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:05,800
Wait, what is that?

1615
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:07,140
Did I miss something here?

1616
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:08,380
What the fuck is that?

1617
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:09,880
Wait, there were treasure here?

1618
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:11,180
What the fuck?

1619
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:11,920
How did I miss that?

1620
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:13,700
Okay, I guess I go back.

1621
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:14,900
I missed some treasure.

1622
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:16,260
Treasure!

1623
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:19,640
Oh no, that's a door!

1624
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:21,520
Wait, but what is that over here?

1625
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:24,260
There's like treasure right here.

1626
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:26,860
God.

1627
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:29,000
Here?

1628
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,040
Can I miss some treasure?

1629
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:34,700
Can I miss some treasure?

1630
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:36,760
Don't tell me I should have looked up.

1631
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:38,880
Is it up treasure?

1632
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:41,140
It has to be up treasure.

1633
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:42,360
It has to be up treasure.

1634
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,500
It's oh, is it this?

1635
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:45,700
There's no way.

1636
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:48,560
Are you treasure?

1637
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:50,000
But you're just a lamp!

1638
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,060
Oh no, you're treasure!

1639
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:54,460
There you go.

1640
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:55,820
I knew it.

1641
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:57,560
I knew you were hiding from me.

1642
01:02:57,820 --> 01:02:57,920
I knew you were hiding from me.

1643
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,660
Okay, I'm gonna reload just in case because the ammo here is so fucking slow.

1644
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:05,100
Hey, we got one of the heads!

1645
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:09,920
Look, money is important guys.

1646
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:12,600
How else am I gonna keep upgrading my shit guys?

1647
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:14,480
Leon deserves it.

1648
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:16,120
Guys, Leon deserves it!

1649
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:18,020
Oh my god.

1650
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:19,820
Is there no reverse?

1651
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:24,000
Is there no- Oh, it's- Okay, I was gonna say.

1652
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:25,740
I was like, where's reverse?

1653
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:26,760
Yes, reverse.

1654
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:28,660
Ivy, thank you for the five!

1655
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:29,520
Get the shivs!

1656
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:29,780
Thank you!

1657
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:33,040
Okay, we need a...

1658
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:34,320
I'm gonna go save.

1659
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:35,600
I don't trust my stuff.

1660
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:36,940
I'm gonna go save real fast.

1661
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:40,120
Don't worry guys, we will progress the story!

1662
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:43,680
It might be an hour later!

1663
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:46,660
But we will progress the story!

1664
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,320
Do not worry!

1665
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:54,220
We will meet Ashley soon!

1666
01:03:54,820 --> 01:03:55,720
We will meet Ashley soon!

1667
01:03:58,400 --> 01:03:59,020
Eventually!

1668
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:00,420
Eventually!

1669
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:01,740
Ashley will be here!

1670
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:03,140
Okay.

1671
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:05,340
Just trust!

1672
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:06,680
Trust the process!

1673
01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:10,920
Okay, we gotta put these two together just in case.

1674
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:12,030
And then...

1675
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:13,900
Let's see...

1676
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:17,320
Okay, we need to put this in here too.

1677
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:18,940
Oh wait, no I can't combine it!

1678
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:19,880
Because I'm so stupid!

1679
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:22,400
Okay, we need a yellow herb.

1680
01:04:23,620 --> 01:04:24,380
Who is Ashley?

1681
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:25,720
Oh, I'm so stupid!

1682
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:29,640
We've been stuck on Chapter 4 for a while now.

1683
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:32,500
Okay.

1684
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:34,580
Guys, no, we need the loot!

1685
01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:36,160
We need the loot so we can upgrade!

1686
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:37,520
It's all about the upgrades!

1687
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:38,820
Think about the bloodline!

1688
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:40,600
Think about it!

1689
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:42,120
Noble, thank you for the super chat!

1690
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:45,820
Guys, think about the bloodline!

1691
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:49,380
How would Leon continue it if he isn't fucking jacked?

1692
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:52,740
Alright, this is it.

1693
01:04:53,660 --> 01:04:55,660
Let's go... this way.

1694
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:57,820
Upgrades, people!

1695
01:04:58,520 --> 01:04:59,000
Upgrades!

1696
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,660
Welcome to the tomato farm!

1697
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:05,440
Welcome, welcome!

1698
01:05:07,740 --> 01:05:08,680
Alright, here we go.

1699
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:12,000
We have to go... oh wait, do the chickens lay new eggs?

1700
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:13,880
Chickens!

1701
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:16,640
Did you guys lay new eggs for me?

1702
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:20,500
Sorry, this is a very important detour.

1703
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:21,220
You won't understand.

1704
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:24,540
Chickens!

1705
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:25,360
What the fuck?

1706
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:28,980
I left you guys there for an hour and you don't lay new eggs?

1707
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:30,280
Guys...

1708
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:32,100
You know what that means.

1709
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:38,280
Chickens!

1710
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:40,300
You lay an egg right now!

1711
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:41,160
Okay, you know what?

1712
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:43,660
If you don't lay an egg...

1713
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:45,120
If you don't lay...

1714
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:46,300
Oh shit, I'm sorry!

1715
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:47,080
I'm sorry!

1716
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:48,340
I'm gonna go now.

1717
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:49,940
I'm gonna go now.

1718
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:55,320
They were too...

1719
01:05:55,940 --> 01:05:56,220
Look...

1720
01:05:56,220 --> 01:05:58,520
They called my bluff, guys.

1721
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:00,040
They called my bluff.

1722
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:01,600
What could I do?

1723
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:03,580
They knew I was bluffing.

1724
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:05,540
They knew.

1725
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:07,360
What could I have done?

1726
01:06:11,860 --> 01:06:13,580
I can't believe they knew.

1727
01:06:15,060 --> 01:06:16,460
You should not be named!

1728
01:06:16,620 --> 01:06:17,640
Thank you for the super chat!

1729
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:17,980
Thank you!

1730
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:20,980
At this rate, I will rescue...

1731
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:21,460
You know what?

1732
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:24,340
That would be more convenient for me if she does rescue herself.

1733
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:27,120
I would be okay with that.

1734
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:27,680
I would be okay with that.

1735
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:31,580
I'd be like 100% okay with that.

1736
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:33,240
If she wants to rescue herself.

1737
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:35,820
Then I can just go home.

1738
01:06:36,180 --> 01:06:37,480
Why the fuck would I...

1739
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:40,900
Why would I keep going?

1740
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,320
I'd rather just go home.

1741
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:44,820
Where is this place?

1742
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:46,000
I'd rather go back...

1743
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:47,900
to my home.

1744
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:52,180
Why would I want to be in Europe?

1745
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:52,980
Like what the fuck?

1746
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:53,740
Right now?

1747
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:55,860
Look at what's going on in Europe right now.

1748
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:58,380
Like... taxes, man.

1749
01:06:59,380 --> 01:06:59,820
Bacon!

1750
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:01,700
Thank you for the magenta soup.

1751
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:02,280
Thank you.

1752
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:06,580
By the time you find Ashley, you can use this for retirement funds.

1753
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,620
Thank you for the magenta soup.

1754
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:09,220
Thank you.

1755
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:12,940
Alright.

1756
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:16,200
Backwards 3.

1757
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:16,760
Backwards 3.

1758
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:19,400
Backwards 3.

1759
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:20,620
Is that it?

1760
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:22,600
Is that all the numbers?

1761
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:25,520
All I see is backwards 3.

1762
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:29,860
Is there more stuff over there?

1763
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:30,680
I can't tell.

1764
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:34,040
Is that a symbol over there?

1765
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:38,340
Oh!

1766
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:39,400
That!

1767
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:41,860
Whatever that is.

1768
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:43,920
Anymore?

1769
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:47,460
All this yellow is not very hard to see.

1770
01:07:47,460 --> 01:07:48,360
Uh...

1771
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:49,540
Amber Alert!

1772
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:51,920
Sammy, thank you for the super chat.

1773
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:52,300
Thank you.

1774
01:07:52,620 --> 01:07:53,680
Ashley Graham.

1775
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:54,860
Caucasian female.

1776
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:55,640
Last seen.

1777
01:07:55,740 --> 01:07:56,640
Resident Evil 4.

1778
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:58,440
Look!

1779
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:00,160
I am trying my best here!

1780
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:01,080
Wait.

1781
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,560
There's so many backwards 3.

1782
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:04,380
Which is the right backwards 3?

1783
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:07,380
There's more backwards 3 to this?

1784
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:10,740
How do I piece the backwards 3 together?

1785
01:08:11,180 --> 01:08:11,360
How do I piece the backwards 3 together?

1786
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:13,880
How do I piece the backwards 3 together?

1787
01:08:13,940 --> 01:08:14,460
What?

1788
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:15,380
Okay, wait.

1789
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:16,320
I'm gonna get on our boat.

1790
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:16,780
Clearly.

1791
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:20,060
This is the second floor.

1792
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:21,540
Well, I can't fucking go through there.

1793
01:08:22,220 --> 01:08:24,300
How the fuck do I go to the second floor?

1794
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:24,880
Oh.

1795
01:08:30,460 --> 01:08:32,360
Guys, I figured it out.

1796
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:37,800
Guys, I did it.

1797
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:40,200
I figured out how to get to the second floor.

1798
01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:41,620
Okay.

1799
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:44,040
Backwards 3 and this line.

1800
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:46,460
Bro, I'm just gonna draw this.

1801
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:47,320
Fuck this.

1802
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:49,720
Bro.

1803
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:51,300
I can't.

1804
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:52,720
I'm too lazy to get a piece of paper.

1805
01:08:52,860 --> 01:08:53,580
Okay, chat.

1806
01:08:53,620 --> 01:08:54,740
You're gonna help me remember this.

1807
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:55,560
Okay.

1808
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:56,920
Um...

1809
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,340
Three people sitting in a group.

1810
01:09:00,780 --> 01:09:02,520
Three people sitting in a group.

1811
01:09:02,660 --> 01:09:05,020
Backwards 3 with a little bump.

1812
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:07,240
Backwards 3 with a little bump.

1813
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:08,260
What's the third one?

1814
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:10,020
Wait.

1815
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:10,940
What's the second button?

1816
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:11,600
What's the second button?

1817
01:09:11,620 --> 01:09:12,280
What's the second one then?

1818
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:13,920
Okay, this is locked.

1819
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:15,400
Okay.

1820
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:17,940
Okay, we got two.

1821
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:19,840
Three fish kissing.

1822
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:20,880
Wait, that's a great one.

1823
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:22,140
Three fish kissing.

1824
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:23,880
Three fishies kissing.

1825
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:27,460
Um... Backwards 3 with a little bump.

1826
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:28,940
Needs to go see a doc.

1827
01:09:28,980 --> 01:09:30,520
Backwards 3 that needs to see a doctor?

1828
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:32,200
Uh...

1829
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:33,260
On the ladder?

1830
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:34,240
Oh!

1831
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:34,940
Tidal waves.

1832
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:36,180
Okay, we got this.

1833
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:37,360
We got this.

1834
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:38,400
We are not brute forcing.

1835
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:39,200
Tidal waves.

1836
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:42,000
Backwards 3 that needs to see a doctor.

1837
01:09:42,380 --> 01:09:43,780
And then three fish kissing.

1838
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:44,940
Yay!

1839
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:47,540
We did it!

1840
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:50,920
Nice.

1841
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:53,560
Oh, and there's money.

1842
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:54,560
I like money.

1843
01:09:56,260 --> 01:09:57,660
Okay, and then we grab that.

1844
01:09:58,120 --> 01:09:59,020
Oh my god!

1845
01:09:59,060 --> 01:09:59,800
There's the hexagon!

1846
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:02,260
Leon has to hurry.

1847
01:10:02,380 --> 01:10:04,340
According to Chris, Clara is hitting on him.

1848
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:07,380
Rodrigo, thank you for the super chat.

1849
01:10:07,460 --> 01:10:08,060
Thank you, thank you.

1850
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:10,280
Alright, nice.

1851
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:12,460
Now we got the key.

1852
01:10:14,180 --> 01:10:15,820
Oh hey, and then there's the...

1853
01:10:16,860 --> 01:10:17,360
stab!

1854
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:19,760
Nice, we got the ruby.

1855
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:21,680
There you go.

1856
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:26,560
Now I can go through this door for no reason.

1857
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:30,120
Alright, nice.

1858
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:32,100
Yay!

1859
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:36,400
Alright, this was definitely much more chill than the other one.

1860
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:37,040
Hahaha!

1861
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:41,660
That was definitely much more chill.

1862
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:44,440
Alright, we go...

1863
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:45,220
Nice!

1864
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:46,360
$100!

1865
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:47,720
Bam!

1866
01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:50,140
Alright, we need to go see the fish.

1867
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:52,920
We have all the hexagon pieces now.

1868
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:56,020
Ashley, don't worry.

1869
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:57,840
We're almost done here, Ashley.

1870
01:10:58,260 --> 01:10:59,740
Ashley, do not worry!

1871
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:02,760
Leon is almost done exploring!

1872
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:04,260
Look!

1873
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:06,640
Look, he's young!

1874
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:07,560
Okay?

1875
01:11:07,780 --> 01:11:08,380
Okay, let's go.

1876
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:09,680
He's young!

1877
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:12,020
And he has to like explore!

1878
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:15,600
He's not gonna be like mid-twenties forever!

1879
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:17,960
Or young twen... I don't know, early twenties?

1880
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:18,860
Hahaha!

1881
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:22,860
Alright, nice.

1882
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:24,500
Now I can do the puzzle!

1883
01:11:25,220 --> 01:11:26,400
Okay, how do I do a puzzle?

1884
01:11:26,580 --> 01:11:26,740
Okay.

1885
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:28,420
What is this?

1886
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:30,580
Is this like that?

1887
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:31,500
Oh, done.

1888
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:31,900
Okay.

1889
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:32,960
That was easy.

1890
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:34,900
That was easy.

1891
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:37,580
Deprived idol?

1892
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:38,840
What's that for?

1893
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:41,420
What the fuck is that for?

1894
01:11:42,660 --> 01:11:44,020
How old is Leon?

1895
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:46,140
Anyway...

1896
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:50,300
I did it!

1897
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:52,720
But what do I do with this?

1898
01:11:53,020 --> 01:11:54,300
What do I...

1899
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:56,400
What do I...

1900
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:57,600
Uh...

1901
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:58,060
Hahaha!

1902
01:12:00,980 --> 01:12:02,540
Is that money?

1903
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,120
I like money.

1904
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:06,340
I like money.

1905
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:08,200
Alright, here we go.

1906
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:10,100
We got it!

1907
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:10,360
Yay!

1908
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:13,220
Okay, now!

1909
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:16,300
Now we go back to the merchant!

1910
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:19,140
Oh, is it treasure?

1911
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:19,940
Nice!

1912
01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:22,500
Guys, I found this historical...

1913
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:24,480
This historical artifact.

1914
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:26,360
This time the British Museum it.

1915
01:12:27,020 --> 01:12:27,580
Hahaha!

1916
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:30,280
Hahaha!

1917
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:35,560
It's good to know Leon is just like the British Museum.

1918
01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:36,340
It's good to know Leon is just like the British Museum.

1919
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:37,400
Alright, here we go.

1920
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:43,200
Why can't you...

1921
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:44,540
Bro, what the fuck?

1922
01:12:45,220 --> 01:12:45,900
There we go.

1923
01:12:45,980 --> 01:12:46,620
I was gonna say like...

1924
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:47,040
What the fuck?

1925
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:48,060
Do I have to park it correctly?

1926
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:49,940
Hahaha!

1927
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:51,340
I mean it is zero!

1928
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:52,820
Hahaha!

1929
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:57,180
Alright, here we go.

1930
01:12:59,020 --> 01:12:59,980
Let's see...

1931
01:12:59,980 --> 01:13:00,860
Did I sell it?

1932
01:13:01,540 --> 01:13:02,500
I can!

1933
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:04,240
An eerie statue!

1934
01:13:04,460 --> 01:13:05,540
Made of gold!

1935
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:06,160
Hello!

1936
01:13:07,780 --> 01:13:08,700
Oh my god!

1937
01:13:08,780 --> 01:13:09,520
This like...

1938
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:14,960
Clearly an historical artifact made hundreds and thousands of years ago.

1939
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:15,220
Whoop!

1940
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:15,880
Time to sell it!

1941
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:17,160
Hahaha!

1942
01:13:18,540 --> 01:13:19,300
You're welcome!

1943
01:13:20,940 --> 01:13:21,380
Alright.

1944
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:23,360
Let's see.

1945
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:24,280
We gotta save our game.

1946
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:25,260
Just in case.

1947
01:13:27,980 --> 01:13:28,420
Alright.

1948
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:33,060
Shoutout to Night!

1949
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:33,820
Thank you for the super chat!

1950
01:13:33,940 --> 01:13:34,180
Thank you!

1951
01:13:34,220 --> 01:13:34,760
Thank you!

1952
01:13:35,180 --> 01:13:36,180
Just looked it up.

1953
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:38,800
Leon is 27 in Resident Evil 4.

1954
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:39,980
And British the idol...

1955
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:41,640
Thank you for the super chat!

1956
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:42,000
Thank you!

1957
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:44,560
What?

1958
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:46,840
15,000 dollar runies?

1959
01:13:47,940 --> 01:13:48,960
Let's fucking go!

1960
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:51,280
It's alright!

1961
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:53,380
If they really want it back...

1962
01:13:53,380 --> 01:13:54,740
They'll just buy it.

1963
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:57,760
If they really want back their artifact...

1964
01:13:57,760 --> 01:13:58,980
They'll just buy it back!

1965
01:13:59,360 --> 01:13:59,720
Hahaha!

1966
01:13:59,740 --> 01:14:02,600
They clearly don't care because it wasn't protected that way!

1967
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:03,060
Hahaha!

1968
01:14:03,340 --> 01:14:03,820
Guys!

1969
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:05,220
That was sarcasm.

1970
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:08,260
Before anybody tries to cancel me for this...

1971
01:14:08,260 --> 01:14:09,500
That was a joke!

1972
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:10,840
Before...

1973
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:13,180
That was a joke!

1974
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:15,920
Before anyone tries to cancel me!

1975
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:16,880
Hahaha!

1976
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:18,320
Hahaha!

1977
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:21,120
Okay.

1978
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:22,420
Let's see.

1979
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:24,600
Um...

1980
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:25,840
Alright.

1981
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:28,020
We gotta go back and place the heads!

1982
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:29,640
Okay.

1983
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:32,360
Alright.

1984
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:32,920
Here we go.

1985
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:36,400
Uhhhh...

1986
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:37,900
Alright.

1987
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:39,460
Time to put the heads in the hands.

1988
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:41,920
They're gonna firmly grasp it.

1989
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:43,160
Oddball!

1990
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:44,000
Thank you for the super chat!

1991
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:44,320
Thank you!

1992
01:14:45,540 --> 01:14:48,120
The adventures of Indiana Doki.

1993
01:14:48,260 --> 01:14:49,700
The quest for more money!

1994
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:51,420
I'm just like Indiana Jones!

1995
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:53,500
But instead of returning the artifacts...

1996
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:54,680
I take it back and sell it.

1997
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:56,200
So like the good one.

1998
01:14:58,080 --> 01:14:59,380
The relatable Jones.

1999
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:02,020
Alright.

2000
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:03,040
Church insignia.

2001
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:04,680
This.

2002
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:05,780
What do I do with this?

2003
01:15:09,550 --> 01:15:10,690
What the quest item?

2004
01:15:10,910 --> 01:15:11,110
What the quest item?

2005
01:15:12,290 --> 01:15:14,250
I have the church insignia now!

2006
01:15:16,870 --> 01:15:17,390
I have the church insignia now!

2007
01:15:17,390 --> 01:15:17,410
Oh.

2008
01:15:17,550 --> 01:15:17,770
Okay.

2009
01:15:17,850 --> 01:15:18,270
I had to call.

2010
01:15:18,530 --> 01:15:18,870
Hahaha!

2011
01:15:20,090 --> 01:15:20,610
Hahaha!

2012
01:15:20,610 --> 01:15:20,650
Hahaha!

2013
01:15:25,210 --> 01:15:30,730
Now I should go get Ashley!

2014
01:15:33,010 --> 01:15:33,970
Oh my god!

2015
01:15:34,310 --> 01:15:35,350
It's Ashley time!

2016
01:15:35,750 --> 01:15:36,130
Finally!

2017
01:15:36,370 --> 01:15:37,510
After trying to get Ashley!

2018
01:15:37,530 --> 01:15:39,670
Now it's Ashley time!

2019
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:40,890
Alright.

2020
01:15:40,970 --> 01:15:42,910
How do I get back to the church though?

2021
01:15:43,690 --> 01:15:44,330
How?

2022
01:15:45,310 --> 01:15:46,510
How do I get there?

2023
01:15:47,290 --> 01:15:47,930
Here?

2024
01:15:48,810 --> 01:15:50,850
How to get to church?

2025
01:15:51,390 --> 01:15:51,910
Hahaha!

2026
01:15:53,450 --> 01:15:54,890
Cause I need help!

2027
01:15:55,050 --> 01:15:57,310
How do we go back to the church?

2028
01:15:57,710 --> 01:15:58,350
Hahaha!

2029
01:15:59,210 --> 01:15:59,290
Hahaha!

2030
01:16:01,670 --> 01:16:02,310
Okay.

2031
01:16:02,470 --> 01:16:03,010
Ashley?

2032
01:16:03,270 --> 01:16:03,710
Okay.

2033
01:16:03,770 --> 01:16:05,010
Where's the fish?

2034
01:16:05,450 --> 01:16:06,090
Guys.

2035
01:16:06,490 --> 01:16:07,510
Where's the lunch box?

2036
01:16:07,530 --> 01:16:08,490
Blunker fish.

2037
01:16:11,190 --> 01:16:13,090
Find from the merchant's area?

2038
01:16:13,390 --> 01:16:13,690
Oh wait.

2039
01:16:13,730 --> 01:16:15,570
That's how we get back to the church.

2040
01:16:16,470 --> 01:16:17,510
The first treasure.

2041
01:16:17,750 --> 01:16:17,990
Okay.

2042
01:16:18,030 --> 01:16:20,430
But how do we get to the boat house?

2043
01:16:23,290 --> 01:16:24,710
Take the boat house.

2044
01:16:24,930 --> 01:16:25,270
Oh!

2045
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:26,450
That's the boat house?

2046
01:16:26,530 --> 01:16:27,350
There's the fish there?

2047
01:16:27,550 --> 01:16:27,890
Okay.

2048
01:16:28,370 --> 01:16:28,850
Alright.

2049
01:16:28,910 --> 01:16:30,130
We go to get the fish.

2050
01:16:32,310 --> 01:16:33,170
We'll do it.

2051
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:34,950
We'll do it.

2052
01:16:35,550 --> 01:16:37,430
Like my Oshii Mr. Krabs.

2053
01:16:37,430 --> 01:16:37,510
Like my Oshii Mr. Krabs.

2054
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:37,990
It says...

2055
01:16:38,870 --> 01:16:39,470
Money?

2056
01:16:40,730 --> 01:16:40,990
Hahaha!

2057
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:45,450
Alright.

2058
01:16:45,550 --> 01:16:45,750
Here.

2059
01:16:46,170 --> 01:16:46,950
Here we go.

2060
01:16:52,310 --> 01:16:52,910
Alright.

2061
01:16:53,170 --> 01:16:53,910
Let's see.

2062
01:16:56,390 --> 01:16:57,430
There he is!

2063
01:16:57,690 --> 01:16:58,270
Can I...

2064
01:16:58,270 --> 01:16:59,730
There he is!

2065
01:17:00,550 --> 01:17:01,130
Bro!

2066
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:02,170
There he is!

2067
01:17:02,770 --> 01:17:03,370
Alright.

2068
01:17:03,530 --> 01:17:06,630
He's gonna walk into my spear right here.

2069
01:17:06,950 --> 01:17:07,550
Boom!

2070
01:17:08,370 --> 01:17:09,350
What the fuck?

2071
01:17:09,410 --> 01:17:10,490
What fish is this?

2072
01:17:11,510 --> 01:17:11,950
Oh.

2073
01:17:12,010 --> 01:17:12,470
There we go.

2074
01:17:13,190 --> 01:17:13,630
Nice.

2075
01:17:13,730 --> 01:17:14,230
I did it.

2076
01:17:16,070 --> 01:17:16,510
Okay.

2077
01:17:16,710 --> 01:17:17,590
Give me a sec.

2078
01:17:17,770 --> 01:17:18,430
I need a...

2079
01:17:18,430 --> 01:17:19,650
I'm circling around.

2080
01:17:20,570 --> 01:17:21,730
Give me a sec.

2081
01:17:22,790 --> 01:17:23,930
Where did the fish go?

2082
01:17:25,810 --> 01:17:26,250
Wait.

2083
01:17:26,270 --> 01:17:26,790
Where did he go?

2084
01:17:27,490 --> 01:17:27,930
Oh.

2085
01:17:27,950 --> 01:17:28,490
There he is!

2086
01:17:28,550 --> 01:17:28,770
Okay.

2087
01:17:29,750 --> 01:17:30,190
Oh.

2088
01:17:30,270 --> 01:17:31,210
It's just a bass!

2089
01:17:32,830 --> 01:17:33,650
It's too small!

2090
01:17:35,630 --> 01:17:36,070
Wait.

2091
01:17:36,150 --> 01:17:38,030
How big are these fish supposed to be?

2092
01:17:39,250 --> 01:17:39,690
Wait.

2093
01:17:39,690 --> 01:17:39,810
How big are these fish supposed to be?

2094
01:17:39,810 --> 01:17:40,590
How big are these fish supposed to be?

2095
01:17:40,610 --> 01:17:41,830
How big are these fish supposed to be?

2096
01:17:42,690 --> 01:17:44,190
It's just dredge time.

2097
01:17:44,630 --> 01:17:44,910
Whoa!

2098
01:17:45,150 --> 01:17:46,110
That's a big fish!

2099
01:17:46,510 --> 01:17:46,950
Okay.

2100
01:17:47,010 --> 01:17:47,590
Now I know!

2101
01:17:48,170 --> 01:17:51,570
Now I know how big the fish is supposed to be.

2102
01:17:52,130 --> 01:17:53,010
Now I know how big the fish is supposed to be.

2103
01:17:53,010 --> 01:17:53,390
Guys.

2104
01:17:53,510 --> 01:17:55,250
I have a size of reference now.

2105
01:17:55,490 --> 01:17:55,590
Guys.

2106
01:17:55,590 --> 01:17:55,590
I have a size of reference now.

2107
01:17:56,070 --> 01:17:56,730
Oh god.

2108
01:17:56,830 --> 01:17:57,030
Okay.

2109
01:17:57,070 --> 01:17:57,250
Good.

2110
01:17:57,310 --> 01:17:57,450
Good.

2111
01:17:57,610 --> 01:17:58,130
That's good.

2112
01:17:58,550 --> 01:18:00,030
I did that so... Okay.

2113
01:18:00,150 --> 01:18:00,610
There we go.

2114
01:18:00,670 --> 01:18:01,230
Now we know.

2115
01:18:01,730 --> 01:18:02,410
Double tap.

2116
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:03,170
Just in case.

2117
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:03,910
Yeah.

2118
01:18:03,910 --> 01:18:04,910
It's supposed to be that big.

2119
01:18:05,210 --> 01:18:05,730
Just in case.

2120
01:18:05,730 --> 01:18:05,730
Yeah.

2121
01:18:05,730 --> 01:18:05,730
It's supposed to be that big.

2122
01:18:07,010 --> 01:18:07,450
Nice.

2123
01:18:07,450 --> 01:18:07,750
Nice.

2124
01:18:07,890 --> 01:18:08,410
Yay!

2125
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:09,150
Oh.

2126
01:18:09,270 --> 01:18:10,130
Come on man!

2127
01:18:10,410 --> 01:18:10,870
Okay.

2128
01:18:11,530 --> 01:18:12,710
We gotta figure...

2129
01:18:12,710 --> 01:18:15,170
We gotta... We gotta fucking...

2130
01:18:18,610 --> 01:18:19,170
Alright.

2131
01:18:19,170 --> 01:18:19,930
There we go.

2132
01:18:20,090 --> 01:18:20,850
Big fish.

2133
01:18:21,850 --> 01:18:22,410
Alright.

2134
01:18:23,230 --> 01:18:24,590
We have to go to the merchant anyway.

2135
01:18:28,230 --> 01:18:28,790
Alright.

2136
01:18:30,710 --> 01:18:31,370
Here we go.

2137
01:18:31,990 --> 01:18:33,350
I can't believe it.

2138
01:18:33,390 --> 01:18:34,690
An hour and twenty minutes.

2139
01:18:34,690 --> 01:18:36,590
And now we're progressing the story.

2140
01:18:41,930 --> 01:18:42,410
Now.

2141
01:18:43,210 --> 01:18:44,870
Now we're progressing.

2142
01:18:48,610 --> 01:18:49,090
Alright.

2143
01:18:49,130 --> 01:18:49,510
Here we go.

2144
01:18:50,030 --> 01:18:52,750
First fish is... What do you mean by that?

2145
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:55,570
What do you mean by the first fish is you?

2146
01:18:55,870 --> 01:18:56,890
In what way?

2147
01:18:57,330 --> 01:18:58,670
In what way?

2148
01:19:01,690 --> 01:19:02,510
What's your name?

2149
01:19:02,570 --> 01:19:03,210
Who said that?

2150
01:19:03,590 --> 01:19:04,470
Who said that?

2151
01:19:04,690 --> 01:19:05,370
Ooh.

2152
01:19:05,550 --> 01:19:05,910
Ooh.

2153
01:19:06,050 --> 01:19:08,950
What do you mean by this?

2154
01:19:09,290 --> 01:19:16,170
What do you mean by this?

2155
01:19:16,170 --> 01:19:16,170
Alright.

2156
01:19:16,350 --> 01:19:17,790
Let's sell this fish.

2157
01:19:18,290 --> 01:19:18,810
Alright.

2158
01:19:18,890 --> 01:19:20,050
It's only five thousand.

2159
01:19:20,250 --> 01:19:21,450
It's a big fish!

2160
01:19:24,430 --> 01:19:24,950
Okay.

2161
01:19:25,070 --> 01:19:25,610
Here we go.

2162
01:19:27,590 --> 01:19:28,110
Damn.

2163
01:19:29,830 --> 01:19:30,650
We did it!

2164
01:19:31,310 --> 01:19:31,830
Yeah!

2165
01:19:32,010 --> 01:19:32,390
Yeah!

2166
01:19:34,750 --> 01:19:35,950
We got an explosive friend!

2167
01:19:36,830 --> 01:19:37,270
Look.

2168
01:19:37,410 --> 01:19:38,930
He made that comment!

2169
01:19:39,250 --> 01:19:41,030
I'm just curious what he meant!

2170
01:19:42,830 --> 01:19:43,450
I'm just curious what he meant!

2171
01:19:43,450 --> 01:19:47,230
I wanna take care of any leftover errands before going this way.

2172
01:19:47,530 --> 01:19:53,370
Be ashamed to live the rest of your life wondering what if am I right?

2173
01:19:53,470 --> 01:19:54,410
I already did everything.

2174
01:19:54,610 --> 01:19:54,710
Oh.

2175
01:19:54,730 --> 01:19:56,210
He's like a hint to be like this is.

2176
01:19:56,290 --> 01:19:57,250
You won't come back here.

2177
01:19:57,850 --> 01:19:58,290
Okay.

2178
01:19:58,930 --> 01:19:59,930
I think we're good.

2179
01:20:00,130 --> 01:20:01,110
I think we did everything.

2180
01:20:01,350 --> 01:20:02,630
I mean we got so many upgrades.

2181
01:20:02,630 --> 01:20:04,170
I swear.

2182
01:20:05,010 --> 01:20:07,150
I did like ten plus saves just in this one area.

2183
01:20:08,530 --> 01:20:09,050
Uhhhhhh.

2184
01:20:10,810 --> 01:20:12,310
Is this how we go back?

2185
01:20:12,630 --> 01:20:13,590
Is this the door?

2186
01:20:14,250 --> 01:20:14,610
Oh wait.

2187
01:20:14,650 --> 01:20:15,830
I missed out on some resources.

2188
01:20:16,850 --> 01:20:17,370
Okay.

2189
01:20:17,490 --> 01:20:18,370
We go through here.

2190
01:20:18,870 --> 01:20:19,390
Boop!

2191
01:20:21,290 --> 01:20:21,810
Alright.

2192
01:20:22,030 --> 01:20:22,810
Here we go.

2193
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:24,670
Up we go!

2194
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:29,920
Alright.

2195
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:30,640
Let's see.

2196
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:33,300
We're missing some resources here.

2197
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:33,880
Alright.

2198
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:33,880
Let's see.

2199
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:33,880
We're missing some resources here.

2200
01:20:36,260 --> 01:20:37,420
Where is it though?

2201
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:37,680
Where is it though?

2202
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:39,220
It's like here somewhere?

2203
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:41,320
Oh there it is.

2204
01:20:41,460 --> 01:20:41,660
Okay.

2205
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:42,260
I found it.

2206
01:20:42,660 --> 01:20:43,180
That's good.

2207
01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:43,980
We needed that too.

2208
01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:44,580
Nice!

2209
01:20:44,780 --> 01:20:45,260
We didn't see.

2210
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:46,200
I forgot about this.

2211
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:49,360
Nice!

2212
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:49,740

Okay.

2216
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:53,540
That means I can put gems in here.

2217
01:20:53,780 --> 01:20:54,100
Okay.

2218
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:54,240
That means I can put gems in here.

2219
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:54,240
Wait.

2220
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:56,220
Three at the same?

2221
01:20:57,660 --> 01:20:58,580
At three at the same.

2222
01:20:58,680 --> 01:20:59,180
1.4.

2223
01:20:59,620 --> 01:21:00,020
Yes!

2224
01:21:00,220 --> 01:21:00,620
Okay.

2226
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:03,720

01:21:09,860 --> 01:21:10,220
Nice!

2232
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:10,680
Alright.

We're going back down.

2234
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:12,120
Guys this is important.

2235
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:13,440
Wait.

2236
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:13,720
How do I?

2237
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:14,880
I'm so lost.

2238
01:21:15,420 --> 01:21:16,160
Which way?

2239
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:17,020
This way?

2240
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:18,240

Now I'm good.

2248
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:36,320
Now I'm done!

2249
01:21:37,220 --> 01:21:37,860
Okay.

2250
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:38,920
Now we progress!

2251
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:40,280
This is it!

2252
01:21:40,460 --> 01:21:41,440
Progression time!

2253
01:21:44,660 --> 01:21:47,460
Now we progress the story!

2254
01:21:47,820 --> 01:21:48,260
Wait.

2255
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,540
You're saying you craft some fucking shotgun ammo?

2256
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:53,500
We are so lacking in that right now.

2257
01:21:55,180 --> 01:21:57,440
Now we progress.

2258
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:01,560
God.

2259
01:22:01,700 --> 01:22:02,840
This is so dark sometimes.

2260
01:22:03,700 --> 01:22:04,340
Okay.

2261
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:04,740
This is...

2262
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:04,980
This way.

2263
01:22:05,060 --> 01:22:05,280
This way.

2264
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:06,180
And then we go.

2265
01:22:06,380 --> 01:22:07,660
God it's so far!

2266
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:09,660
Where's my quick travel?

2267
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:10,900
Where's my Fastpass?

2268
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:16,700
Oh shit!

2269
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:16,920
Oh!

2270
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:18,040
It's a troll!

2271
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:20,660
It's time to pay the toll!

2272
01:22:31,060 --> 01:22:31,880
Oh God.

2273
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:32,700
This is it!

2274
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:34,360
This is it!

2275
01:22:38,140 --> 01:22:40,440
We gotta keep April...

2276
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:43,920
Guys, this is it guys!

2277
01:22:45,140 --> 01:22:47,120
This is what the rifle is for!

2278
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:51,540
This is it!

2279
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:52,600
Oh my god.

2280
01:22:53,340 --> 01:22:54,740
Oh my god.

2281
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:57,080
Oh...

2282
01:22:58,660 --> 01:23:00,240
Oh he does!

2283
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:01,960
Oh what?!

2284
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:04,540
Why can't I run from that?!

2285
01:23:04,540 --> 01:23:06,440
Oh my god thank god I have so much eggs!

2286
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:08,640
It's egg time!

2287
01:23:10,340 --> 01:23:11,800
I have the reload!

2288
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:13,140
Sir please wait!

2289
01:23:13,260 --> 01:23:13,940
Please wait!

2290
01:23:14,060 --> 01:23:14,840
Please wait!

2291
01:23:15,020 --> 01:23:15,740
Please wait!

2292
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:18,160
Please wait!

2293
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:18,940
Please wait!

2294
01:23:22,220 --> 01:23:22,780
Yes!

2295
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:24,560
Wooo!

2296
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:40,820
Oh I could have done a quick time event with that.

2297
01:23:40,980 --> 01:23:42,000
I'm done.

2298
01:23:42,640 --> 01:23:42,960
Wooo!

2299
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:43,340
Nice!

2300
01:23:46,470 --> 01:23:47,450
Don't kill him!

2301
01:23:47,730 --> 01:23:48,690
Don't kill him!

2302
01:23:48,790 --> 01:23:49,010
No!

2303
01:23:55,830 --> 01:23:56,950
Oh god.

2304
01:23:57,070 --> 01:23:57,770
Oh god.

2305
01:23:58,110 --> 01:23:59,490
I didn't realize I could use it.

2306
01:23:59,510 --> 01:24:00,230
Wait what?

2307
01:24:00,410 --> 01:24:01,510
Wait is that it?

2308
01:24:01,810 --> 01:24:03,130
That's what I'm talking about!

2309
01:24:03,430 --> 01:24:04,310
Good boy!

2310
01:24:04,590 --> 01:24:05,510
Good boy!

2311
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:11,260
Oh god.

2312
01:24:11,420 --> 01:24:12,240
Oh god.

2313
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:14,900
No!

2314
01:24:14,900 --> 01:24:15,780
He wants to run!

2315
01:24:20,490 --> 01:24:21,670
Give me a sec!

2316
01:24:22,890 --> 01:24:23,490
Yes!

2317
01:24:25,230 --> 01:24:26,130
Large boy!

2318
01:24:27,650 --> 01:24:28,470
Bro what?

2319
01:24:28,610 --> 01:24:29,030
That's it?

2320
01:24:29,270 --> 01:24:30,510
I told you.

2321
01:24:30,670 --> 01:24:32,170
I told you!

2322
01:24:32,170 --> 01:24:35,130
Rifle is for bosses only!

2323
01:24:37,610 --> 01:24:39,250
I told you!

2324
01:24:40,110 --> 01:24:42,790
This is why I didn't use my rifle!

2325
01:24:43,590 --> 01:24:44,290
Let's get to that church.

2326
01:24:45,390 --> 01:24:47,870
RIFLE IS FOR BOSSES ONLY!

2327
01:24:47,870 --> 01:24:47,890
RIFLE IS FOR BOSSES ONLY!

2328
01:24:49,070 --> 01:24:50,330
Where's the good wolf?

2329
01:24:50,930 --> 01:24:52,690
Where did the good wolf go?

2330
01:24:53,270 --> 01:24:53,310
Where did the good wolf go?

2331
01:24:56,510 --> 01:24:57,570
Oh shit.

2332
01:24:57,670 --> 01:24:58,650
Nice loot.

2333
01:24:59,950 --> 01:25:01,310
Oh shit.

2334
01:25:01,470 --> 01:25:02,150
Nice loot.

2335
01:25:02,150 --> 01:25:02,790
Boop!

2336
01:25:03,150 --> 01:25:03,710
Nice.

2337
01:25:03,930 --> 01:25:04,130
Alright.

2338
01:25:04,290 --> 01:25:06,310
We need more rifle ammo though.

2339
01:25:06,410 --> 01:25:07,730
We are actually lacking now.

2340
01:25:07,890 --> 01:25:09,590
In the rifle department.

2341
01:25:10,370 --> 01:25:11,510
Okay we got...

2342
01:25:11,930 --> 01:25:13,630
We gotta like save up for this.

2343
01:25:14,910 --> 01:25:16,470
His mission is done.

2344
01:25:16,770 --> 01:25:17,430
Thank you.

2345
01:25:17,470 --> 01:25:17,830
Finally.

2346
01:25:18,610 --> 01:25:20,610
Finally we have the good wolf.

2347
01:25:21,210 --> 01:25:23,590
We waited so long for him to show up.

2348
01:25:24,370 --> 01:25:25,030
We waited so long for him to show up.

2349
01:25:25,590 --> 01:25:27,630
Oh my god there's so much kitchen knives too.

2350
01:25:27,830 --> 01:25:30,270
Oh my god I'm raining in fucking ammo.

2351
01:25:31,190 --> 01:25:32,310
Jesus Christ.

2352
01:25:32,610 --> 01:25:34,150
This is a mess now.

2353
01:25:36,470 --> 01:25:39,750
This is actually a mess to look at now.

2354
01:25:40,890 --> 01:25:41,450
This is actually a mess to look at now.

2355
01:25:41,450 --> 01:25:44,370
We can combine this to make the super potions.

2356
01:25:44,610 --> 01:25:44,630
We can combine this to make the super potions.

2357
01:25:45,110 --> 01:25:46,230
Oh my god.

2358
01:25:46,390 --> 01:25:47,770
Bro this hurts to look at.

2359
01:25:51,470 --> 01:25:53,150
Go into his den.

2360
01:25:53,230 --> 01:25:54,350
Oh yeah his little home.

2361
01:25:56,570 --> 01:25:58,410
There must be stuff in here right?

2362
01:25:59,130 --> 01:26:00,250
Wait is this the...

2363
01:26:01,490 --> 01:26:03,030
Wait did I come from here?

2364
01:26:03,070 --> 01:26:04,030
No I came from here.

2365
01:26:04,090 --> 01:26:04,890
Where is your house?

2366
01:26:05,430 --> 01:26:06,190
Is it here?

2367
01:26:07,570 --> 01:26:09,170
Yeah this is where you live right?

2368
01:26:11,310 --> 01:26:12,230
Six months.

2369
01:26:12,750 --> 01:26:15,070
It's teeth have only just come through.

2370
01:26:15,250 --> 01:26:18,950
But it shoves everything within it's reach into it's mouth.

2371
01:26:19,210 --> 01:26:20,410
It can't walk yet.

2372
01:26:20,510 --> 01:26:22,570
But it swallowed a dog whole.

2373
01:26:22,890 --> 01:26:23,870
Nine months.

2374
01:26:24,190 --> 01:26:25,950
It already towers over me.

2375
01:26:26,110 --> 01:26:27,410
But it keeps growing.

2376
01:26:28,430 --> 01:26:30,250
The town hall can no longer lock it.

2377
01:26:30,270 --> 01:26:31,130
It can no longer contain it.

2378
01:26:31,210 --> 01:26:32,210
Ten months.

2379
01:26:32,390 --> 01:26:33,590
It keeps growing.

2380
01:26:33,910 --> 01:26:36,170
Even after moving to the quarry.

2381
01:26:36,270 --> 01:26:39,830
It can devour a whole cow in only three days.

2382
01:26:40,270 --> 01:26:44,170
It can swing our largest pig ass as if it were a twig.

2383
01:26:44,390 --> 01:26:47,850
One of the men of the village was almost eaten today too.

2384
01:26:48,090 --> 01:26:49,930
It's not getting enough food.

2385
01:26:50,990 --> 01:26:52,110
Seventeen months.

2386
01:26:52,370 --> 01:26:55,070
There are only a few cows left now.

2387
01:26:55,270 --> 01:26:58,030
At this rate the whole village will starve.

2388
01:26:58,470 --> 01:27:00,190
We summoned help from the castle.

2389
01:27:00,270 --> 01:27:03,430
And had them put the beast to sleep with an incantation.

2390
01:27:03,630 --> 01:27:06,790
Hopefully it won't wait for a long time.

2391
01:27:07,010 --> 01:27:08,050
That sucks man.

2392
01:27:08,270 --> 01:27:09,890
You spent all this time.

2393
01:27:10,210 --> 01:27:11,530
This is a tiny house.

2394
01:27:12,370 --> 01:27:14,390
This is a really tiny house.

2395
01:27:14,570 --> 01:27:15,890
That poor fucking troll.

2396
01:27:16,810 --> 01:27:17,850
Oh my god.

2397
01:27:18,350 --> 01:27:20,390
Wait it even had leftover meat.

2398
01:27:20,450 --> 01:27:21,350
How are you starving?

2399
01:27:21,690 --> 01:27:23,590
You literally had meat here.

2400
01:27:26,230 --> 01:27:27,290
Oh my god.

2401
01:27:27,870 --> 01:27:29,830
It's so hard to get food.

2402
01:27:29,830 --> 01:27:30,850
Hello troll.

2403
01:27:31,330 --> 01:27:33,310
I didn't need to pay the toll.

2404
01:27:34,130 --> 01:27:35,690
Is there anything else I missed?

2405
01:27:35,830 --> 01:27:36,950
I think I got everything right?

2406
01:27:37,190 --> 01:27:37,890
Poor guy.

2407
01:27:41,250 --> 01:27:41,770
Dog!

2408
01:27:44,410 --> 01:27:45,290
Hello dog.

2409
01:27:46,050 --> 01:27:47,650
Thank you for your service.

2410
01:27:53,260 --> 01:27:53,780
Here.

2411
01:27:54,060 --> 01:27:57,060
Let us cut our palms.

2412
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,780
And shake our hands.

2413
01:27:58,820 --> 01:28:00,220
So we can be blood brothers.

2414
01:28:01,580 --> 01:28:01,760
Hahaha.

2415
01:28:02,980 --> 01:28:03,540
Hahaha.

2416
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:05,240
What?

2417
01:28:05,420 --> 01:28:06,520
It's a blood pack.

2418
01:28:08,940 --> 01:28:10,540
He did a good job.

2419
01:28:10,700 --> 01:28:13,480
I'm just trying to do a blood pack with him.

2420
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:15,300
Where the fuck do I go?

2421
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:16,540
This way?

2422
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:20,180
Where's my flashlight?

2423
01:28:21,700 --> 01:28:22,800
Alright here you go.

2424
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:24,640
Give him an egg.

2425
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:27,180
You cannot pet the dog.

2426
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:28,400
9 out of 10.

2427
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:29,800
I can't believe it.

2428
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:31,360
I can't pet the fucking dog.

2429
01:28:32,940 --> 01:28:34,180
9 out of 10.

2430
01:28:34,340 --> 01:28:35,260
What's the point?

2431
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:37,660
What the fuck is the point?

2432
01:28:37,860 --> 01:28:39,000
You can't pet the dog.

2433
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:43,140
Alright this way.

2434
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:47,000
Okay.

2435
01:28:47,140 --> 01:28:49,620
I have so much ammo for my handgun now.

2436
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:51,360
God.

2437
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:53,980
I hope Ashley does never shows up.

2438
01:28:54,180 --> 01:28:55,240
Oh god evil dog.

2439
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:56,120
You know what?

2440
01:28:56,980 --> 01:28:57,800
Evil dog.

2441
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:58,980
Goodbye evil dog.

2442
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:00,280
Goodbye.

2443
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:01,460
Jesus.

2444
01:29:01,580 --> 01:29:02,800
This gun is so strong now.

2445
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,780
Alright we gotta go to the church.

2446
01:29:08,460 --> 01:29:09,420
It's church time.

2447
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:12,460
You guys have any confessions to make?

2448
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:13,320
Oh wait.

2449
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:14,100
There's a...

2450
01:29:14,100 --> 01:29:17,340
Let me go save my game.

2451
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:19,480
I forgot there's like a hole here.

2452
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:21,340
Here right?

2453
01:29:22,240 --> 01:29:22,720
Here.

2454
01:29:23,180 --> 01:29:24,660
Yeah there's a safe spot here.

2455
01:29:26,380 --> 01:29:26,860
Alright.

2456
01:29:26,940 --> 01:29:28,400
Save the game first.

2457
01:29:28,580 --> 01:29:29,840
Before we do anything.

2458
01:29:31,580 --> 01:29:32,960
I don't wanna kill the troll again.

2459
01:29:34,300 --> 01:29:34,880
Alright.

2460
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:38,340
Game breaking bug.

2461
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:40,040
Can't pet the...

2462
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:41,520
The dog.

2463
01:29:41,940 --> 01:29:43,120
What's the point?

2464
01:29:43,660 --> 01:29:44,240
Hahahaha.

2465
01:29:45,660 --> 01:29:46,240
Hahahaha.

2466
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:49,200
I would like to return this game.

2467
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:51,900
Let's see.

2468
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:55,600
Yeah but I can't do anything with that.

2469
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:56,680
It's a locked drawer.

2470
01:30:00,190 --> 01:30:00,850
Let's see.

2471
01:30:00,970 --> 01:30:01,530
Here we go.

2472
01:30:02,630 --> 01:30:03,310
I have a key.

2473
01:30:03,330 --> 01:30:03,810
I have the thing.

2474
01:30:04,010 --> 01:30:05,390
We're progressing the story.

2475
01:30:11,940 --> 01:30:12,580
Nice.

2476
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:15,100
This is a well designed church.

2477
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:17,820
This is where all the villagers money went into.

2478
01:30:19,320 --> 01:30:19,960
Hello.

2479
01:30:20,580 --> 01:30:21,500
I am...

2480
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:23,140
It's this puzzle.

2481
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:26,340
I know this puzzle.

2482
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:29,240
We have to align this thing.

2483
01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:32,180
Look for Ashley in the church.

2484
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:36,620
I got a key.

2485
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:40,760
Wait I can unlock the door.

2486
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:41,720
Okay.

2487
01:30:42,580 --> 01:30:43,020
Ashley?

2488
01:30:49,130 --> 01:30:49,790
Puzzle time.

2489
01:30:53,750 --> 01:30:54,190
Okay.

2490
01:30:54,730 --> 01:30:56,450
Wait but what about the other button?

2491
01:30:57,450 --> 01:30:58,550
Is there another button?

2492
01:30:59,970 --> 01:31:00,810
Oh maybe...

2493
01:31:00,810 --> 01:31:01,910
Maybe the...

2494
01:31:01,910 --> 01:31:02,150
Oh wait.

2495
01:31:02,510 --> 01:31:02,950
Vault.

2496
01:31:03,270 --> 01:31:04,790
What the fuck I don't have an arrow.

2497
01:31:04,850 --> 01:31:05,670
I don't have a thing there.

2498
01:31:09,550 --> 01:31:11,790
Do I need to...

2499
01:31:11,790 --> 01:31:13,410
Where do you find the other button?

2500
01:31:13,610 --> 01:31:14,130
I don't remember.

2501
01:31:15,450 --> 01:31:16,110
Oh hey.

2502
01:31:16,230 --> 01:31:16,930
Why are these...

2503
01:31:16,930 --> 01:31:19,770
I like how they're all the ammo I don't need.

2504
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:24,530
I don't have any of those guns.

2505
01:31:24,770 --> 01:31:25,910
What are you trying to say?

2506
01:31:27,510 --> 01:31:28,370
Oh there you go.

2507
01:31:28,410 --> 01:31:29,070
There's the blue dial.

2508
01:31:29,290 --> 01:31:29,730
Nice.

2509
01:31:29,910 --> 01:31:30,710
There it is.

2510
01:31:33,350 --> 01:31:35,830
What are you trying to say man?

2511
01:31:38,090 --> 01:31:40,230
Okay we're gonna put this here.

2512
01:31:40,630 --> 01:31:41,790
God damn it.

2513
01:31:41,830 --> 01:31:42,770
I don't have any.

2514
01:31:42,970 --> 01:31:44,950
The merch is not near me.

2515
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:48,090
Okay we're gonna figure this out.

2516
01:31:48,310 --> 01:31:49,070
We need to...

2517
01:31:49,070 --> 01:31:50,530
We need to clean this up.

2518
01:31:51,430 --> 01:31:53,570
Okay and then we'll...

2519
01:31:53,570 --> 01:31:54,410
Put that...

2520
01:31:54,410 --> 01:31:57,570
Okay this is definitely not clean.

2521
01:31:58,530 --> 01:31:59,170
Okay.

2522
01:31:59,570 --> 01:32:00,710
There we go.

2523
01:32:01,630 --> 01:32:01,950
Perfect.

2524
01:32:01,950 --> 01:32:03,310
We need like...

2525
01:32:03,310 --> 01:32:05,950
One more so I can craft more rifle ammo.

2526
01:32:06,150 --> 01:32:07,030
And then we should be good.

2527
01:32:07,990 --> 01:32:09,810
And then everything will be okay.

2528
01:32:10,330 --> 01:32:12,090
This might not look very pretty.

2529
01:32:12,170 --> 01:32:13,710
But everything will be okay soon.

2530
01:32:14,070 --> 01:32:16,870
Everything will be okay soon.

2531
01:32:20,670 --> 01:32:21,230
Okay.

2532
01:32:21,230 --> 01:32:21,790
Bam.

2533
01:32:22,390 --> 01:32:22,950
Okay.

2534
01:32:24,270 --> 01:32:25,910
I need to remember how to do this.

2535
01:32:30,450 --> 01:32:31,930
Clearly not like...

2536
01:32:31,950 --> 01:32:32,230
Like that.

2537
01:32:32,610 --> 01:32:33,010
No.

2538
01:32:33,330 --> 01:32:34,110
Oh here.

2539
01:32:34,330 --> 01:32:35,510
Okay we got that.

2540
01:32:36,470 --> 01:32:37,830
And then...

2541
01:32:37,830 --> 01:32:39,470
Oh this puzzle is easy.

2542
01:32:39,830 --> 01:32:42,170
It's as easy as the fucking...

2543
01:32:42,170 --> 01:32:43,750
The other puzzle.

2544
01:32:43,830 --> 01:32:44,450
The circles.

2545
01:32:44,870 --> 01:32:45,550
There.

2546
01:32:46,510 --> 01:32:47,670
For babies.

2547
01:32:50,290 --> 01:32:50,970
Nice.

2548
01:32:50,970 --> 01:32:51,750
Oh that's so pretty.

2549
01:32:52,750 --> 01:32:53,750
Alright Ashley.

2550
01:32:53,790 --> 01:32:54,950
We're finally gonna find you.

2551
01:32:55,710 --> 01:32:56,930
It's time Ashley.

2552
01:33:01,470 --> 01:33:02,530
Alright Ashley.

2553
01:33:04,790 --> 01:33:05,430
Ashley?

2554
01:33:07,230 --> 01:33:07,870
Ashley?

2555
01:33:10,690 --> 01:33:11,330
Oh.

2556
01:33:11,330 --> 01:33:11,970
Nice.

2557
01:33:12,190 --> 01:33:14,210
Okay now we can craft the rifle.

2558
01:33:16,030 --> 01:33:16,670
Nice.

2559
01:33:16,670 --> 01:33:18,050
Okay this feels a lot better.

2560
01:33:20,310 --> 01:33:22,630
This looks a little bit better.

2561
01:33:23,430 --> 01:33:24,070
This looks a little bit better.

2562
01:33:24,070 --> 01:33:26,310
This looks a bit better.

2563
01:33:27,490 --> 01:33:28,430
Okay guys.

2564
01:33:29,130 --> 01:33:30,170
It looks...

2565
01:33:30,170 --> 01:33:32,310
It looks less fucked up.

2566
01:33:34,610 --> 01:33:37,750
Okay but what if I just put all of this below here.

2567
01:33:38,430 --> 01:33:39,750
And I put this here.

2568
01:33:40,030 --> 01:33:40,650
And then there.

2569
01:33:41,010 --> 01:33:41,670
There you go.

2570
01:33:42,850 --> 01:33:43,290
Efficiency.

2571
01:33:44,150 --> 01:33:45,490
We're not gonna eat the eggs.

2572
01:33:45,510 --> 01:33:46,230
I'm full HP.

2573
01:33:46,690 --> 01:33:47,610
There's no point.

2574
01:33:48,690 --> 01:33:52,090
There's no point to eat the eggs when you're full HP guys.

2575
01:33:55,690 --> 01:33:57,190
I'm trying to make sure I don't...

2576
01:33:57,190 --> 01:33:58,210
Oh hey there's Ashley's phone.

2577
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:02,760
Okay.

2578
01:34:04,380 --> 01:34:05,020
Okay.

2579
01:34:05,100 --> 01:34:05,860
Okay there's nothing here.

2580
01:34:05,980 --> 01:34:07,420
So she's behind this door.

2581
01:34:11,680 --> 01:34:12,320
Ashley?

2582
01:34:14,040 --> 01:34:15,140
Ashley are you here?

2583
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:16,120
Ashley Graham are you in here?

2584
01:34:17,820 --> 01:34:19,100
Oh shit!

2585
01:34:19,740 --> 01:34:20,180
Oh shit!

2586
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:21,560
Oh shit!

2587
01:34:22,740 --> 01:34:23,380
Oh shit!

2588
01:34:24,920 --> 01:34:27,000
It's not a phase Leon!

2589
01:34:27,480 --> 01:34:28,500
Oh shit!

2590
01:34:29,020 --> 01:34:29,660
Oh shit!

2591
01:34:30,860 --> 01:34:31,500
Oh shit!

2592
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:43,860
Come here man.

2593
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:44,620
What?

2594
01:34:51,880 --> 01:34:53,700
This isn't a phase Leon.

2595
01:34:55,900 --> 01:34:58,740
Oh no it's the second time!

2596
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:00,040
Not a phase 對

2597
01:35:05,740 --> 01:35:06,860
Oh f***!

2598
01:35:06,900 --> 01:35:07,340
Guys!

2599
01:35:07,780 --> 01:35:08,340
Guys!

2600
01:35:08,820 --> 01:35:10,540
I just need to know guys!

2601
01:35:13,080 --> 01:35:14,120
Does it end?

2602
01:35:14,380 --> 01:35:16,000
Does the wave end?

2603
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:20,080
Because if it does, I'm just gonna kill all of them.

2604
01:35:26,820 --> 01:35:29,320
Oh my god, we finally completed the chapter!

2605
01:35:30,140 --> 01:35:30,780
Yay!

2606
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:35,840
It does?

2607
01:35:36,140 --> 01:35:37,840
I'm gonna kill all of them.

2608
01:35:37,940 --> 01:35:39,560
I'm not gonna steal.

2609
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:46,260
Guys, I have enough ammo to do this, clearly.

2610
01:35:46,840 --> 01:35:49,340
It will... everything has an end.

2611
01:35:49,460 --> 01:35:49,900
Good.

2612
01:35:52,420 --> 01:35:54,040
That's all that matters.

2613
01:35:55,120 --> 01:35:55,640
Alright.

2614
01:35:57,800 --> 01:35:58,540
It's time.

2615
01:35:58,680 --> 01:35:59,320
We have to.

2616
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:00,900
We have too much inventory space.

2617
01:36:03,340 --> 01:36:04,340
What do we do?

2618
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:08,260
We kill all of them, Ashley.

2619
01:36:12,420 --> 01:36:14,000
We're gonna do it Doki style.

2620
01:36:14,240 --> 01:36:16,220
Brute force it until they're all dead.

2621
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:20,060
Guys, I'm such an ugly...

2622
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:20,520
Ugly skin.

2623
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:24,640
It makes me feel less bad.

2624
01:36:25,700 --> 01:36:27,940
When she dies... if she dies.

2625
01:36:28,300 --> 01:36:30,040
It makes me feel less horrible.

2626
01:36:35,450 --> 01:36:36,050
Alright.

2627
01:36:39,470 --> 01:36:41,530
Okay, we can get up here.

2628
01:36:42,070 --> 01:36:45,010
We go up here and then we kill them all.

2629
01:36:45,390 --> 01:36:46,290
Go Ashley.

2630
01:36:50,380 --> 01:36:51,380
Go Ashley, go.

2631
01:36:51,940 --> 01:36:54,200
Uh, Jesus Christ.

2632
01:36:54,280 --> 01:36:55,740
Just throw .

2633
01:36:55,740 --> 01:36:58,320
It's an ugly outfit.

2634
01:37:01,160 --> 01:37:02,220
Okay, Ashley.

2635
01:37:02,300 --> 01:37:03,260
You stay here.

2636
01:37:03,540 --> 01:37:05,180
And I'm gonna shoot everything.

2637
01:37:08,260 --> 01:37:09,280
Dude...you okay?

2638
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:11,480
Ashley, you stay here.

2639
01:37:11,660 --> 01:37:13,780
I'm gonna shoot everything.

2640
01:37:14,200 --> 01:37:14,660
Ashley.

2641
01:37:20,360 --> 01:37:20,840
Okay.

2642
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:22,480
Alright, there we go.

2643
01:37:22,540 --> 01:37:23,400
Now she's safe.

2644
01:37:26,770 --> 01:37:27,530
There we go.

2645
01:37:28,910 --> 01:37:31,070
We have so much ammo, we can do this.

2646
01:37:31,990 --> 01:37:32,390
Ow!

2647
01:37:32,470 --> 01:37:33,110
Oh fuck!

2648
01:37:33,310 --> 01:37:33,630
Okay.

2649
01:37:34,750 --> 01:37:38,050
Alright, let's just get that out of the way.

2650
01:37:42,090 --> 01:37:43,050
Alright, reloading.

2651
01:37:46,130 --> 01:37:47,250
Wait, where is he going?

2652
01:37:47,510 --> 01:37:47,930
Hello?

2653
01:37:48,030 --> 01:37:49,070
I'm over here.

2654
01:37:53,470 --> 01:37:53,770
Hello.

2655
01:37:55,810 --> 01:37:56,410
Nice.

2656
01:37:57,370 --> 01:37:58,550
Is she gonna turn?

2657
01:37:59,350 --> 01:38:01,070
Wait, they don't even have loot!

2658
01:38:01,950 --> 01:38:03,330
What the fuck?!

2659
01:38:03,330 --> 01:38:04,690
They don't even have loot?!

2660
01:38:05,270 --> 01:38:05,750
Bro!

2661
01:38:05,790 --> 01:38:05,990
This...

2662
01:38:09,950 --> 01:38:10,130
Bro!

2663
01:38:10,510 --> 01:38:12,190
They don't even have loot!

2664
01:38:13,510 --> 01:38:16,350
It's supposed to be sneaked out.

2665
01:38:19,470 --> 01:38:21,110
What's the point?!

2666
01:38:23,410 --> 01:38:24,390
Oh my god.

2667
01:38:24,430 --> 01:38:25,610
Ashley, I don't wanna look at you.

2668
01:38:29,130 --> 01:38:33,330
Oh look, I don't get punished because there was ammo here anyway.

2669
01:38:35,230 --> 01:38:36,470
Oh my god.

2670
01:38:36,510 --> 01:38:37,790
I thought I could've got free loot!

2671
01:38:38,450 --> 01:38:39,590
This is so unfair.

2672
01:38:41,210 --> 01:38:44,610
UwUzaporok just killed the not-so-innocent elderly.

2673
01:38:45,710 --> 01:38:46,650
Alright, here we go.

2674
01:38:50,480 --> 01:38:52,140
I can't get over this outfit.

2675
01:38:52,280 --> 01:38:53,620
Damn, it's really something.

2676
01:38:53,700 --> 01:38:54,720
Thank you, sweet soul.

2677
01:38:54,860 --> 01:38:55,960
Thank you for the super chat.

2678
01:38:56,020 --> 01:38:56,260
Thank you.

2679
01:38:58,400 --> 01:38:59,440
Stay there!

2680
01:39:00,040 --> 01:39:01,240
Just don't leave!

2681
01:39:07,080 --> 01:39:08,860
I can't look at her.

2682
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:09,680
Make it stop.

2683
01:39:12,060 --> 01:39:14,080
Hey, thank you for the super chat.

2684
01:39:14,340 --> 01:39:15,140
Thank you.

2685
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:17,680
Don't keep calling Ashley's outfit ugly.

2686
01:39:17,740 --> 01:39:19,020
It's breaking my heart.

2687
01:39:26,780 --> 01:39:28,640
No, what about the makeup?

2688
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:31,800
Okay, you stay here.

2689
01:39:34,160 --> 01:39:37,300
Um... I can't... No, she follows me forever.

2690
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:38,080
Fuck, okay.

2691
01:39:41,700 --> 01:39:44,360
I got baby eagle.

2692
01:39:44,360 --> 01:39:45,100
She's right here.

2693
01:39:46,100 --> 01:39:46,660
Sure.

2694
01:39:57,740 --> 01:39:59,060
I'll try my best.

2695
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:02,640
Can you not just send a helicopter here?

2696
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:05,240
Can you send a helicopter here?

2697
01:40:06,040 --> 01:40:07,940
Head for the extraction point.

2698
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:09,640
Jesus Christ, it's all the way...

2699
01:40:09,640 --> 01:40:11,040
Okay, we're clearly not gonna...

2700
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:14,540
Well, knowing by this, you're gonna get kidnapped somewhere here.

2701
01:40:14,920 --> 01:40:15,920
Alright, Ashley!

2702
01:40:16,660 --> 01:40:20,940
I'm gonna make you stay somewhere very close by.

2703
01:40:21,340 --> 01:40:22,280
Okay, Ashley?

2704
01:40:23,080 --> 01:40:26,080
You are going to... Okay, I'm just gonna fucking...

2705
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:28,880
open this real fast.

2706
01:40:29,860 --> 01:40:30,140
Alright.

2707
01:40:30,140 --> 01:40:30,440
Alright.

2708
01:40:31,880 --> 01:40:32,580
Here we go.

2709
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:33,780
Okay, Ashley.

2710
01:40:34,160 --> 01:40:34,900
Your job!

2711
01:40:35,780 --> 01:40:37,300
Okay, tight and loose.

2712
01:40:37,720 --> 01:40:39,060
Switch between tight...

2713
01:40:39,060 --> 01:40:40,340
Ashley, stay close while...

2714
01:40:40,340 --> 01:40:42,540
You can... It's gonna be effective when running past enemies.

2715
01:40:43,220 --> 01:40:44,240
Okay, switch...

2716
01:40:44,240 --> 01:40:46,220
Ashley, hang behind...

2717
01:40:46,740 --> 01:40:47,680
Okay, that is...

2718
01:40:47,680 --> 01:40:49,200
We'll hang... What the fuck?

2719
01:40:49,820 --> 01:40:51,520
Behind Leon while in loose...

2720
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:53,440
This can help her avoid enemies' attack.

2721
01:40:54,140 --> 01:40:54,620
Okay.

2722
01:40:55,220 --> 01:40:57,260
Ashley, stay close behind while in tight formation.

2723
01:40:57,400 --> 01:40:58,880
It's gonna be effective when running past enemies.

2724
01:40:58,880 --> 01:41:00,160
Ashley, you... Okay.

2725
01:41:00,500 --> 01:41:01,540
How do I make her stay?

2726
01:41:01,900 --> 01:41:02,300
Stay.

2727
01:41:03,120 --> 01:41:03,780
Where am I?

2728
01:41:03,960 --> 01:41:04,520
Spread out.

2729
01:41:05,220 --> 01:41:05,620
Okay.

2730
01:41:06,180 --> 01:41:06,800
On me.

2731
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:07,680
On me.

2732
01:41:07,780 --> 01:41:08,060
Okay.

2733
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:09,200
Just...

2734
01:41:09,200 --> 01:41:09,780
Give me some space.

2735
01:41:09,800 --> 01:41:10,220
Spread out.

2736
01:41:10,300 --> 01:41:11,120
Okay, spread out.

2737
01:41:11,120 --> 01:41:11,520
Give me space.

2738
01:41:16,220 --> 01:41:17,040
Alright, here we go.

2739
01:41:18,280 --> 01:41:18,940
Here we go.

2740
01:41:19,540 --> 01:41:20,180
We're just...

2741
01:41:20,180 --> 01:41:20,660
Get behind me.

2742
01:41:20,940 --> 01:41:21,640
Get behind me.

2743
01:41:21,820 --> 01:41:23,640
What is wrong with these people?

2744
01:41:23,820 --> 01:41:26,740
I don't know, but I don't think they like that I'm fucking shooting them.

2745
01:41:27,180 --> 01:41:28,260
I think that was it.

2746
01:41:29,480 --> 01:41:30,500
Oh, that's a lot.

2747
01:41:31,080 --> 01:41:32,120
Okay, let me reload.

2748
01:41:32,660 --> 01:41:33,540
Alright, here we go.

2749
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:34,340
This is it.

2750
01:41:34,380 --> 01:41:35,940
This is where things get spicy.

2751
01:41:40,350 --> 01:41:41,230
Alright, here we go.

2752
01:41:44,250 --> 01:41:44,930
Oh, shit.

2753
01:41:44,970 --> 01:41:45,350
There we go.

2754
01:41:47,830 --> 01:41:48,390
It's fine.

2755
01:41:48,570 --> 01:41:49,130
Thick thighs.

2756
01:41:49,690 --> 01:41:50,390
Save lives.

2757
01:41:51,150 --> 01:41:53,930
Ashley, and this is why you gotta buff up your thighs.

2758
01:41:55,370 --> 01:41:57,130
Oh, Ashley, stay behind me.

2759
01:41:57,650 --> 01:41:58,490
Ashley, no.

2760
01:42:02,510 --> 01:42:03,210
No, come on, maybe like right now.

2761
01:42:08,750 --> 01:42:09,450
Ashley!

2762
01:42:09,950 --> 01:42:10,250
Ashley!

2763
01:42:10,250 --> 01:42:12,330
I said stay behind me!

2764
01:42:15,070 --> 01:42:16,690
That is not tight!

2765
01:42:23,190 --> 01:42:25,830
Ok, oh my god what...

2766
01:42:25,830 --> 01:42:26,990
Oh, fuck!

2767
01:42:27,290 --> 01:42:28,570
This is what eggs are for.

2768
01:42:31,570 --> 01:42:33,470
This is what eggs are for.

2769
01:42:33,470 --> 01:42:34,270
Thanks for...

2770
01:42:35,970 --> 01:42:36,410
Okay.

2771
01:42:37,790 --> 01:42:39,130
Guys, I have no time to-

2772
01:42:42,340 --> 01:42:46,760
Oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god, please I'm reloading.

2773
01:42:51,680 --> 01:42:52,940
Are you okay?

2774
01:42:53,560 --> 01:42:54,400
Alright, nice.

2775
01:42:55,120 --> 01:42:55,960
Okay, we're fine.

2776
01:42:57,840 --> 01:42:58,280
Alright.

2777
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:00,060
Get the fuck up.

2778
01:43:00,680 --> 01:43:02,440
Get the fuck up.

2779
01:43:03,700 --> 01:43:05,140
Okay, we're fine.

2780
01:43:05,340 --> 01:43:07,440
Just stay in here, I'm gonna open this drawer.

2781
01:43:11,180 --> 01:43:14,080
Okay, we got the- we're gonna save our game now.

2782
01:43:14,340 --> 01:43:20,640
We're gonna save- actually, please, afford our love, oh god, where is the stay here command?

2783
01:43:21,660 --> 01:43:27,620
I thought- I thought this- I- Ochi Resident Evil 4 had stay here.

2784
01:43:30,700 --> 01:43:32,420
This is what all does.

2785
01:43:32,440 --> 01:43:33,500
All the eggs were for her.

2786
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:35,540
Thank fucking god for the eggs.

2787
01:43:36,760 --> 01:43:38,180
Okay, we're gonna put this here.

2788
01:43:38,680 --> 01:43:39,280
Alright.

2789
01:43:39,620 --> 01:43:43,480
She is not- She was in the original?!

2790
01:43:45,080 --> 01:43:48,220
The original let me say stay here?!

2791
01:43:51,180 --> 01:43:52,100
Okay, let's see.

2792
01:43:52,180 --> 01:43:55,340
Do I have enough to make more shotgun ammo?

2793
01:43:55,540 --> 01:43:57,420
Cause that is what we need right now.

2794
01:43:57,980 --> 01:43:58,580
Craft.

2795
01:43:58,920 --> 01:44:02,340
Oh, thank god, we had to- Okay.

2796
01:44:02,440 --> 01:44:03,240
Okay, there you go, thank god.

2797
01:44:03,400 --> 01:44:03,580
Okay.

2798
01:44:04,380 --> 01:44:06,720
Oh, she's a rebel now.

2799
01:44:08,320 --> 01:44:10,140
Bro, fucking Ashley, man.

2800
01:44:11,220 --> 01:44:11,780
Alright.

2801
01:44:14,760 --> 01:44:16,140
Stay behind me!

2802
01:44:19,440 --> 01:44:20,000
Where?

2803
01:44:20,180 --> 01:44:21,580
I hear some noise.

2804
01:44:26,410 --> 01:44:27,590
Wait, there's ammo here though.

2805
01:44:28,970 --> 01:44:30,350
Time to make some noise.

2806
01:44:32,190 --> 01:44:33,050
Wait, what?

2807
01:44:34,170 --> 01:44:34,870
Here we go.

2808
01:44:36,250 --> 01:44:38,470
Oh, I couldn't run in there in time.

2809
01:44:40,090 --> 01:44:41,150
Oh, nice thing guy.

2810
01:44:44,570 --> 01:44:50,330
Alright, I need you to die a bit faster so I can take your loot.

2811
01:44:50,730 --> 01:44:51,870
Nice gunpowder.

2812
01:44:53,030 --> 01:44:53,910
That is good.

2813
01:44:54,830 --> 01:44:56,510
Stay behind me, Ashley!

2814
01:44:57,530 --> 01:44:58,030
Behind!

2815
01:44:59,410 --> 01:44:59,910
Behind!

2816
01:44:59,910 --> 01:45:00,330
Behind!

2817
01:45:04,070 --> 01:45:04,470
Please.

2818
01:45:04,470 --> 01:45:04,870
Please.

2819
01:45:05,210 --> 01:45:05,610
Behind!

2820
01:45:06,190 --> 01:45:07,130
Okay, nice.

2821
01:45:07,170 --> 01:45:07,970
The merchant's here.

2822
01:45:08,370 --> 01:45:09,130
Oh, thank god.

2823
01:45:10,990 --> 01:45:11,810
Oh, thank god.

2824
01:45:11,850 --> 01:45:12,690
Thank you for the money.

2825
01:45:14,570 --> 01:45:15,270
Oh, you do?

2826
01:45:15,690 --> 01:45:17,590
I need- We're gonna do items.

2827
01:45:19,030 --> 01:45:20,530
Oh, it's- these are not new items.

2828
01:45:20,590 --> 01:45:21,550
I had all of these.

2829
01:45:21,610 --> 01:45:22,570
What the fuck do you mean?

2830
01:45:24,250 --> 01:45:25,110
You're a liar!

2831
01:45:25,370 --> 01:45:26,450
They're the same thing!

2832
01:45:27,470 --> 01:45:28,370
Okay, let's see.

2833
01:45:28,410 --> 01:45:31,470
We're gonna have to sell our- like- one of our flash grenades.

2834
01:45:31,630 --> 01:45:32,670
We have way too much.

2835
01:45:32,850 --> 01:45:35,410
We're gonna- We have- We have- wait.

2836
01:45:35,530 --> 01:45:36,770
Okay, we're gonna sell the bolts.

2837
01:45:36,870 --> 01:45:39,130
Cause we are not running any bolts.

2838
01:45:39,450 --> 01:45:42,330
And we are not running submachine gun.

2839
01:45:45,720 --> 01:45:47,800
We are not running submachine gun.

2840
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:49,220
We have everything we need!

2841
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:51,480
We have ammo!

2842
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:56,880
We have- We ha- look, we just have too much flashes!

2843
01:45:57,420 --> 01:45:59,300
We had too many!

2844
01:46:01,960 --> 01:46:03,920
We just had too many, okay?

2845
01:46:04,020 --> 01:46:06,340
I just don't have enough space, guys.

2846
01:46:06,900 --> 01:46:09,660
We had- we just didn't have a lot of space.

2847
01:46:10,280 --> 01:46:11,880
If it was worth it.

2848
01:46:11,920 --> 01:46:12,780
Worth the exchange.

2849
01:46:13,480 --> 01:46:14,000
Look!

2850
01:46:14,060 --> 01:46:16,700
Look how much better my inventory is now.

2851
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:17,500
Chat.

2852
01:46:18,460 --> 01:46:21,240
Like, it was a pro- it was turning into a problem.

2853
01:46:21,460 --> 01:46:22,920
I was becoming a hoarder.

2854
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:24,140
And that's bad.

2855
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:25,160
Honestly.

2856
01:46:28,080 --> 01:46:31,280
Like, it started getting a little too messy, guys.

2857
01:46:31,960 --> 01:46:34,660
Like, it started- Okay, here we go.

2858
01:46:35,540 --> 01:46:38,800
Like, it was starting to become a really bad, big problem.

2859
01:46:41,020 --> 01:46:41,800
Alright, save.

2860
01:46:44,040 --> 01:46:45,320
Okay, Ashley, here we go.

2861
01:46:46,980 --> 01:46:48,400
Thank you for the super chat!

2862
01:46:48,460 --> 01:46:49,200
Thank you, thank you!

2863
01:46:49,340 --> 01:46:52,320
I think it's time to get rid of the wild dog that's been roaming out- Which one?

2864
01:46:53,260 --> 01:46:54,400
There were so many!

2865
01:46:55,240 --> 01:46:57,300
There's so many wild dogs!

2866
01:46:57,600 --> 01:46:58,440
Which one?

2867
01:47:04,980 --> 01:47:06,980
Which one are they talking about?

2868
01:47:09,560 --> 01:47:11,100
There's like, so many!

2869
01:47:11,280 --> 01:47:13,840
Don't tell me they're fucking bigger than before.

2870
01:47:14,660 --> 01:47:16,720
The super duper dog.

2871
01:47:17,220 --> 01:47:18,040
Oh no.

2872
01:47:18,120 --> 01:47:19,460
I have Ashley here!

2873
01:47:21,460 --> 01:47:23,620
I mean, you can if you don't stay with the merchant.

2874
01:47:25,060 --> 01:47:26,640
Do I need to reload my gun?

2875
01:47:26,740 --> 01:47:27,200
No, I don't.

2876
01:47:27,320 --> 01:47:28,340
Okay, I just have to be sure.

2877
01:47:29,300 --> 01:47:29,480
Hahaha.

2878
01:47:30,720 --> 01:47:31,820
Dan, thank you for the super chat!

2879
01:47:31,880 --> 01:47:32,400
Thank you, thank you!

2880
01:47:32,440 --> 01:47:34,120
Why does everyone hate the SMG?

2881
01:47:34,180 --> 01:47:35,060
It's a great gun.

2882
01:47:35,200 --> 01:47:37,140
Well, the pistol is just faster.

2883
01:47:37,320 --> 01:47:38,500
I just have to hit the headshot.

2884
01:47:39,880 --> 01:47:41,820
Which I totally do, because I'm a gamer.

2885
01:47:43,080 --> 01:47:45,180
I just think the pistol is just faster.

2886
01:47:49,120 --> 01:47:50,760
I missed the stay here command.

2887
01:47:52,920 --> 01:47:54,220
Okay, is there an end?

2888
01:47:54,700 --> 01:47:56,100
Guys, I need to know!

2889
01:47:56,880 --> 01:47:58,740
Is there an end to these guys?

2890
01:47:59,180 --> 01:47:59,540
Hahaha.

2891
01:48:01,180 --> 01:48:02,300
Oh, did I miss the bearer?

2892
01:48:03,140 --> 01:48:04,340
Oh, there it is.

2893
01:48:04,400 --> 01:48:05,160
Like, right in front of me.

2894
01:48:06,580 --> 01:48:07,000
Yes?

2895
01:48:07,200 --> 01:48:07,900
Okay, it's time.

2896
01:48:08,520 --> 01:48:09,480
It's time, guys.

2897
01:48:09,540 --> 01:48:10,340
There is an end.

2898
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:12,880
Every time there's an end, I fight.

2899
01:48:14,100 --> 01:48:14,800
I fight.

2900
01:48:20,690 --> 01:48:21,870
If there's an end.

2901
01:48:23,290 --> 01:48:24,270
Oh fuck, okay.

2902
01:48:26,390 --> 01:48:27,690
Oh my god!

2903
01:48:27,790 --> 01:48:28,370
Ashley, no!

2904
01:48:28,870 --> 01:48:29,810
Stay behind!

2905
01:48:30,650 --> 01:48:31,070
Hahaha.

2906
01:48:35,130 --> 01:48:35,650
Ashley!

2907
01:48:35,650 --> 01:48:37,010
I said tight!

2908
01:48:39,690 --> 01:48:40,210
Hahaha.

2909
01:48:42,410 --> 01:48:43,650
Oh my god.

2910
01:48:45,770 --> 01:48:46,870
Okay, here we go.

2911
01:48:50,380 --> 01:48:51,120
Alright, nice.

2912
01:48:51,160 --> 01:48:52,060
We can guard the window.

2913
01:48:53,220 --> 01:48:54,820
Guys, we'll just guard the window.

2914
01:48:58,720 --> 01:48:59,240
Nice.

2915
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:04,560
We'll just guard the window.

2916
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:07,620
Oh my god!

2917
01:49:07,780 --> 01:49:09,080
Okay, we're fucking throwing this.

2918
01:49:09,880 --> 01:49:10,980
Son of a bitch.

2919
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:15,560
Okay.

2920
01:49:16,840 --> 01:49:17,400
Easy.

2921
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:21,460
Guys, and that is how you guard the window.

2922
01:49:23,780 --> 01:49:26,860
Guys, the window.

2923
01:49:27,040 --> 01:49:28,600
The window is the strat!

2924
01:49:29,860 --> 01:49:31,980
They always have to come to the window!

2925
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:34,580
There we go.

2926
01:49:37,820 --> 01:49:39,040
Just guard the window!

2927
01:49:40,500 --> 01:49:40,980
Nice.

2928
01:49:44,480 --> 01:49:45,980
The power of the window!

2929
01:49:58,020 --> 01:49:58,800
There you go.

2930
01:49:59,160 --> 01:49:59,980
Is that everybody?

2931
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:02,680
There... okay.

2932
01:50:02,760 --> 01:50:03,960
Now that's not cool, man.

2933
01:50:06,340 --> 01:50:08,420
Okay, I know you're gonna pop up now.

2934
01:50:11,180 --> 01:50:11,940
Alright, nice.

2935
01:50:12,760 --> 01:50:13,520
Are you dead?

2936
01:50:13,660 --> 01:50:14,660
I can't tell the window!

2937
01:50:14,660 --> 01:50:15,600
The window is so dark!

2938
01:50:19,160 --> 01:50:19,640
Window!

2939
01:50:20,500 --> 01:50:22,280
Okay, Ashley, this is why...

2940
01:50:22,280 --> 01:50:23,760
This is why I have the cheese.

2941
01:50:24,080 --> 01:50:25,040
It's because of you.

2942
01:50:28,540 --> 01:50:30,080
Ashley, this is your fault.

2943
01:50:30,260 --> 01:50:32,880
I have the cheese even harder because of you.

2944
01:50:34,640 --> 01:50:35,440
Are they done?

2945
01:50:38,640 --> 01:50:40,380
Okay, are they all dead?

2946
01:50:41,180 --> 01:50:42,320
I killed a lot.

2947
01:50:44,200 --> 01:50:47,120
Alright, no, I don't have a window anymore if I have to do this.

2948
01:50:50,060 --> 01:50:51,640
The window MVP.

2949
01:50:52,840 --> 01:50:53,880
Oh my god.

2950
01:50:54,020 --> 01:50:55,240
Definitely gonna catch a cold.

2951
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:57,340
Ashley, shut the fuck up.

2952
01:50:57,540 --> 01:50:57,900
I have to...

2953
01:50:57,900 --> 01:50:59,840
You're the... You're a problem.

2954
01:51:00,500 --> 01:51:02,140
You're a problem right now.

2955
01:51:06,060 --> 01:51:07,420
Okay, let's see.

2956
01:51:08,680 --> 01:51:09,640
Oh my god.

2957
01:51:09,780 --> 01:51:11,960
Oh, my inventory is so empty now.

2958
01:51:20,940 --> 01:51:21,540
Oh my god.

2959
01:51:21,540 --> 01:51:23,500
Okay, let's see...

2960
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:25,320
Alright...

2961
01:51:25,320 --> 01:51:26,880
Oh, we can finally get this loot.

2962
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:27,340
Ashley!

2963
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:32,920
Are they all dead?

2964
01:51:33,580 --> 01:51:35,040
Have we windowed enough?

2965
01:51:37,620 --> 01:51:39,100
No, I hear one guy.

2966
01:51:40,080 --> 01:51:41,660
I hear him, lurking.

2967
01:51:41,660 --> 01:51:41,920
I'm freaking...

2968
01:51:45,260 --> 01:51:46,120
Alright, there you go.

2969
01:51:47,620 --> 01:51:48,580
Wait, what the fuck?

2970
01:51:49,180 --> 01:51:50,040
Where is he going?

2971
01:51:53,140 --> 01:51:54,280
Does he know I'm here?

2972
01:51:55,240 --> 01:51:56,720
Does this man know I'm here?

2973
01:51:56,800 --> 01:51:57,760
I don't know if he knows.

2974
01:51:58,260 --> 01:51:59,100
I don't know.

2975
01:51:59,800 --> 01:52:00,700
I can't tell.

2976
01:52:00,980 --> 01:52:02,080
Oh my god!

2977
01:52:02,200 --> 01:52:02,640
Okay!

2978
01:52:04,560 --> 01:52:05,000
Alright.

2979
01:52:05,240 --> 01:52:07,380
No, I don't think he still knows, guys.

2980
01:52:07,940 --> 01:52:08,640
It's okay.

2981
01:52:08,680 --> 01:52:10,460
We can kill him all the way here.

2982
01:52:10,620 --> 01:52:11,380
He still doesn't know.

2983
01:52:11,420 --> 01:52:12,120
He's walking back.

2984
01:52:14,100 --> 01:52:16,680
Guys, I don't think he knows.

2985
01:52:16,760 --> 01:52:17,700
He's walking backwards.

2986
01:52:18,860 --> 01:52:19,400
We're fine.

2987
01:52:22,540 --> 01:52:23,740
Actually, cover your ears.

2988
01:52:23,820 --> 01:52:24,780
I think he can make this shot.

2989
01:52:25,800 --> 01:52:27,020
I think he can make this shot.

2990
01:52:27,760 --> 01:52:28,160
Okay.

2991
01:52:29,700 --> 01:52:31,640
It was a waste of my ammo.

2992
01:52:33,500 --> 01:52:34,860
It should be this, right?

2993
01:52:34,940 --> 01:52:37,280
Wait, where is the... Oh no, it's the door behind us.

2994
01:52:37,680 --> 01:52:38,080
Alright.

2995
01:52:40,440 --> 01:52:41,320
It's right here.

2996
01:52:42,500 --> 01:52:42,940
Nice.

2997
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:43,980
Ashley, come over here.

2998
01:52:44,200 --> 01:52:45,220
I need this loot.

2999
01:52:45,900 --> 01:52:48,140
This is exactly why I needed you here.

3000
01:52:48,280 --> 01:52:49,300
This is the most imp...

3001
01:52:49,300 --> 01:52:50,160
This is your purpose.

3002
01:52:52,680 --> 01:52:54,240
This is your entire purpose.

3003
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:55,860
To open that one door for me.

3004
01:53:03,560 --> 01:53:04,700
Come on, Ashley.

3005
01:53:06,120 --> 01:53:06,560
Nice.

3006
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:07,200
Thank you.

3007
01:53:07,260 --> 01:53:08,880
I've always wanted to be in this room.

3008
01:53:09,500 --> 01:53:10,680
Alright, now you can leave.

3009
01:53:11,120 --> 01:53:11,640
Nice.

3010
01:53:12,720 --> 01:53:13,600
What is this?

3011
01:53:13,980 --> 01:53:15,700
The Elegant Vangle!

3012
01:53:16,900 --> 01:53:18,020
Oh my god!

3013
01:53:19,340 --> 01:53:19,860
Okay.

3014
01:53:20,220 --> 01:53:23,820
I can put the two yellow stones in!

3015
01:53:25,140 --> 01:53:26,740
Oh my god, how much money is it?

3016
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:27,820
22,000.

3017
01:53:27,820 --> 01:53:29,480
Ashley, good job, girl.

3018
01:53:29,660 --> 01:53:30,640
You were worth it.

3019
01:53:31,120 --> 01:53:32,700
You were worth babysitting.

3020
01:53:33,280 --> 01:53:35,540
Get paid $5 to babysit.

3021
01:53:35,560 --> 01:53:37,360
Get $22,000 back.

3022
01:53:38,280 --> 01:53:38,800
Profit.

3023
01:53:40,080 --> 01:53:40,640
Alright.

3024
01:53:40,780 --> 01:53:43,380
We gotta kill that one guy over here, right?

3025
01:53:44,640 --> 01:53:45,200
Okay.

3026
01:53:45,260 --> 01:53:46,020
Let's see.

3027
01:53:47,100 --> 01:53:51,900
I'm gonna make sure all the people here are dead before I do any of this.

3028
01:53:53,480 --> 01:53:55,160
Like, I hear noises.

3029
01:53:55,400 --> 01:53:57,340
I don't know if it's coming from...

3030
01:53:59,180 --> 01:54:00,900
Like, where is that coming from?

3031
01:54:01,080 --> 01:54:01,640
Inside?

3032
01:54:03,700 --> 01:54:05,020
Is there somebody inside?

3033
01:54:06,080 --> 01:54:07,520
I hear the...

3034
01:54:08,580 --> 01:54:09,480
I hear the...

3035
01:54:09,500 --> 01:54:11,440
I'm like, fucking, up-bees.

3036
01:54:11,640 --> 01:54:13,000
Or, up-bees.

3037
01:54:13,180 --> 01:54:14,120
Up-bees.

3038
01:54:15,400 --> 01:54:17,420
Where is that coming from?

3039
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:20,480
Who's calling for up-bees right now?

3040
01:54:24,580 --> 01:54:25,620
Okay, we go up.

3041
01:54:29,500 --> 01:54:31,120
Who wants up-bees?

3042
01:54:34,600 --> 01:54:35,600
You hear that?

3043
01:54:35,880 --> 01:54:38,000
They keep calling for up-bees!

3044
01:54:43,650 --> 01:54:44,410
Him, right?

3045
01:54:44,490 --> 01:54:45,170
Is it this guy?

3046
01:54:47,110 --> 01:54:48,130
Oh, it's him!

3047
01:54:48,870 --> 01:54:50,470
He wanted up-bees!

3048
01:54:54,760 --> 01:54:56,160
I fucking knew it!

3049
01:54:56,320 --> 01:54:56,760
Oh, fuck.

3050
01:54:57,400 --> 01:54:58,240
Oh, fuck.

3051
01:54:58,320 --> 01:54:58,960
Oh, fuck!

3052
01:55:00,140 --> 01:55:00,660
No!

3053
01:55:01,520 --> 01:55:02,040
Okay.

3054
01:55:03,320 --> 01:55:03,840
Alright.

3055
01:55:04,220 --> 01:55:05,560
He fucking scared me.

3056
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:07,940
Alright, we got him.

3057
01:55:08,700 --> 01:55:09,400
It's fine.

3058
01:55:09,480 --> 01:55:10,660
We still have the eggs.

3059
01:55:11,180 --> 01:55:12,060
It's fine.

3060
01:55:12,900 --> 01:55:14,180
Actually, I don't even need a heal.

3061
01:55:15,080 --> 01:55:16,080
There we go, we're fine.

3062
01:55:16,400 --> 01:55:18,600
From 80 bullets to 20.

3063
01:55:18,620 --> 01:55:19,980
20 bullets.

3064
01:55:20,680 --> 01:55:21,860
It was worth it.

3065
01:55:22,020 --> 01:55:24,580
I wonder if I should open...

3066
01:55:24,580 --> 01:55:27,480
I feel like they'd be empty because I looted this area already.

3067
01:55:28,040 --> 01:55:28,380
Yeah?

3068
01:55:28,520 --> 01:55:29,580
Yeah, I looted this.

3069
01:55:30,940 --> 01:55:31,860
Alright, here we go.

3070
01:55:32,760 --> 01:55:33,640
They're all dead.

3071
01:55:33,820 --> 01:55:34,440
We did it.

3072
01:55:37,680 --> 01:55:39,440
Mayor's house before you progress?

3073
01:55:40,040 --> 01:55:41,460
Where's the mayor's house?

3074
01:55:42,020 --> 01:55:42,540
Here?

3075
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:45,220
Guys, I don't know where the fucking mayor lives.

3076
01:55:45,700 --> 01:55:46,220
Like...

3077
01:55:46,220 --> 01:55:47,100
Oh, here!

3078
01:55:48,620 --> 01:55:49,920
Okay, but what do I get?

3079
01:55:51,620 --> 01:55:54,140
Guys, but what do I get though?

3080
01:55:57,360 --> 01:55:59,900
You gotta convince me here.

3081
01:56:00,160 --> 01:56:01,700
How much money?

3082
01:56:07,620 --> 01:56:08,540
A jewel?

3083
01:56:09,360 --> 01:56:09,900
Okay.

3084
01:56:10,340 --> 01:56:11,840
Oh, I have Ashley though.

3085
01:56:12,260 --> 01:56:13,880
Guys, but what if I die?

3086
01:56:13,880 --> 01:56:14,160
Hi!

3087
01:56:16,460 --> 01:56:18,640
I have to deal with Ashley!

3088
01:56:19,640 --> 01:56:20,280
Like...

3089
01:56:24,560 --> 01:56:26,760
Okay, now we're talking business.

3090
01:56:28,400 --> 01:56:29,040
Okay.

3091
01:56:29,200 --> 01:56:29,840
Guys!

3092
01:56:30,640 --> 01:56:32,400
I have to deal with Ashley though!

3093
01:56:34,620 --> 01:56:36,380
It's worth the risk.

3094
01:56:37,900 --> 01:56:39,640
It's worth the Ashley risk?

3095
01:56:40,040 --> 01:56:42,240
Okay, I'm gonna go save my game then.

3096
01:56:46,960 --> 01:56:49,740
Guys, I'm gonna go save my game.

3097
01:56:50,280 --> 01:56:51,240
There's no way.

3098
01:56:51,680 --> 01:56:53,200
Ashley, you're coming with me.

3099
01:56:53,240 --> 01:56:54,160
We're saving our game.

3100
01:56:54,240 --> 01:56:56,220
I fucking killed so many people with the window.

3101
01:56:57,280 --> 01:57:00,860
Ashley, you are not worth it, girl.

3102
01:57:05,400 --> 01:57:07,760
You're absolutely not worth it.

3103
01:57:10,420 --> 01:57:10,900
Alright.

3104
01:57:10,900 --> 01:57:11,920
Here we go.

3105
01:57:14,100 --> 01:57:14,580
Okay.

3106
01:57:16,860 --> 01:57:17,660
Alright, here we go.

3107
01:57:18,600 --> 01:57:19,780
Oh, where did Ashley go?

3108
01:57:19,860 --> 01:57:20,360
Oh, there she is.

3109
01:57:20,500 --> 01:57:20,700
Okay.

3110
01:57:21,580 --> 01:57:22,060
Alright.

3111
01:57:22,060 --> 01:57:23,980
Please, stay behind me, Ashley.

3112
01:57:24,380 --> 01:57:25,280
Okay, you know what?

3113
01:57:25,320 --> 01:57:25,800
You guys were right.

3114
01:57:25,880 --> 01:57:26,700
I miss OG Ashley.

3115
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:28,300
This Ashley fucking sucks.

3116
01:57:28,740 --> 01:57:29,220
Like...

3117
01:57:30,580 --> 01:57:32,480
This Ashley is terrible.

3118
01:57:32,980 --> 01:57:34,480
At least OG Ashley...

3119
01:57:34,480 --> 01:57:36,520
If I tell her to stay, she stays.

3120
01:57:37,220 --> 01:57:37,740
This Ashley is terrible.

3121
01:57:37,760 --> 01:57:38,760
This Ashley does not stay.

3122
01:57:40,420 --> 01:57:43,600
This Ashley does not know the concept of please stand back.

3123
01:57:43,740 --> 01:57:44,760
I have a gun.

3124
01:57:50,180 --> 01:57:50,700
Okay.

3125
01:57:50,760 --> 01:57:51,840
It should be this way.

3126
01:57:54,720 --> 01:57:55,760
Back we go.

3127
01:57:57,180 --> 01:57:59,180
Can I trade for OG Ashley?

3128
01:58:02,140 --> 01:58:03,260
Oh my god.

3129
01:58:03,400 --> 01:58:04,460
Okay, I'm gonna bring my shotgun.

3130
01:58:04,540 --> 01:58:06,400
Just in case we see the super dog.

3131
01:58:08,120 --> 01:58:10,640
Just in case super dog decides to show up.

3132
01:58:11,320 --> 01:58:12,160
Super dog?

3133
01:58:14,860 --> 01:58:15,780
Super dog?

3134
01:58:16,500 --> 01:58:18,360
We all wanna go home, Ashley.

3135
01:58:18,480 --> 01:58:19,240
But here we are.

3136
01:58:24,750 --> 01:58:25,630
Super dog.

3137
01:58:25,730 --> 01:58:26,450
Where are you?

3138
01:58:30,160 --> 01:58:31,240
Where's super dog?

3139
01:58:32,220 --> 01:58:33,340
I don't like that.

3140
01:58:33,580 --> 01:58:35,480
It started making the ambience noise.

3141
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:40,260
Super dog?

3142
01:58:41,940 --> 01:58:43,520
Is super dog here?

3143
01:58:45,020 --> 01:58:45,980
Super dog.

3144
01:58:46,100 --> 01:58:47,240
Why is there...

3145
01:58:47,260 --> 01:58:48,540
creepy ambience?

3146
01:58:50,800 --> 01:58:52,000
Where's that treasure?

3147
01:58:52,140 --> 01:58:52,420
Is that...

3148
01:58:52,420 --> 01:58:54,020
Oh, the savage mud.

3149
01:58:54,140 --> 01:58:54,440
Okay.

3150
01:58:54,500 --> 01:58:55,560
Super dog is here.

3151
01:58:55,800 --> 01:58:57,060
Alright, super dog.

3152
01:59:01,570 --> 01:59:04,490
Super dog is apparently here now.

3153
01:59:04,930 --> 01:59:07,550
Is the super dog in the room with us?

3154
01:59:08,450 --> 01:59:09,090
Is the super dog in the room with us?

3155
01:59:13,520 --> 01:59:14,500
Is the super dog in the room with us?

3156
01:59:14,500 --> 01:59:14,900
Super dog?

3157
01:59:16,500 --> 01:59:17,860
Where are you?

3158
01:59:18,120 --> 01:59:19,040
Where are you?

3159
01:59:21,540 --> 01:59:23,600
Is the treasure like...

3160
01:59:23,600 --> 01:59:24,220
upstairs?

3161
01:59:25,980 --> 01:59:27,380
Cause I don't remember.

3162
01:59:32,170 --> 01:59:32,910
Super dog?

3163
01:59:34,650 --> 01:59:35,930
Alright, time to save.

3164
01:59:41,130 --> 01:59:41,690
Okay.

3165
01:59:42,490 --> 01:59:44,690
Super dog, I have a shotgun!

3166
01:59:44,930 --> 01:59:46,450
I have a treat for you!

3167
01:59:49,070 --> 01:59:49,630
Hello?

3168
01:59:52,050 --> 01:59:53,150
Where's super dog?

3169
01:59:55,450 --> 01:59:57,110
I forgot where the treasure is.

3170
01:59:59,670 --> 02:00:02,070
Oh, it's a collapsible ladder!

3171
02:00:02,350 --> 02:00:04,350
This is where super dog is!

3172
02:00:05,330 --> 02:00:06,010
Got it.

3173
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:10,020
Alright, here you go.

3174
02:00:17,320 --> 02:00:18,180
Alright, nice.

3175
02:00:18,860 --> 02:00:19,560
I'm up.

3176
02:00:20,980 --> 02:00:21,980
It's called treasure.

3177
02:00:25,260 --> 02:00:25,820
Okay.

3178
02:00:27,440 --> 02:00:29,000
All the men cheered...

3179
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:30,320
And then everyone clapped.

3180
02:00:30,560 --> 02:00:31,100
All the men...

3181
02:00:31,100 --> 02:00:34,260
All the men cheered when they heard the boat.

3182
02:00:34,340 --> 02:00:34,440
Oh, I'm so sorry.

3183
02:00:46,860 --> 02:00:48,020
This is really fun!

3184
02:00:50,020 --> 02:00:51,440
Alright, let's go up hill.

3185
02:00:51,700 --> 02:00:52,000
Oh, what?

3186
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:52,360
This is great.

3187
02:00:52,360 --> 02:00:52,520
Oh, I like it.

3188
02:00:52,580 --> 02:00:52,600
It's amazing.

3189
02:00:52,600 --> 02:00:52,640
This is the treasure.

3190
02:00:52,720 --> 02:00:54,100
I'm really glad that you're here.

3191
02:00:54,100 --> 02:00:54,300
I love having you here.

3192
02:00:54,400 --> 02:00:56,040
What about you guys?

3193
02:00:56,060 --> 02:00:57,460
It's a pleasure.

3194
02:00:59,460 --> 02:00:59,480
Nice.

3195
02:01:28,040 --> 02:01:29,440
Okay.

3196
02:01:37,380 --> 02:01:42,760
I don't know if a fucking guy came from a castle and injected you with something.

3197
02:01:43,040 --> 02:01:43,900
I don't know.

3198
02:01:43,920 --> 02:01:44,840
Do you trust that?

3199
02:01:46,100 --> 02:01:48,040
And that really be trusted.

3200
02:01:48,560 --> 02:01:49,560
Oh, that's him!

3201
02:01:50,140 --> 02:01:51,220
Is that a priest?

3202
02:01:51,660 --> 02:01:53,220
What is that?

3203
02:01:53,420 --> 02:01:57,280
Watch over the village in my stead and me smiles always find you in photographs.

3204
02:01:58,040 --> 02:01:59,140
A little bit.

3205
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,400
Yes, he shouldn't.

3206
02:02:02,400 --> 02:02:04,140
Oh hey, there's a...

3207
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:05,960
Nice.

3208
02:02:06,620 --> 02:02:07,800
Alright, reload.

3209
02:02:10,160 --> 02:02:11,360
Okay, what's this photo?

3210
02:02:11,660 --> 02:02:12,200
Is this lore?

3211
02:02:13,700 --> 02:02:15,340
The long awaited ironworks.

3212
02:02:15,920 --> 02:02:16,600
Oh, this is lore.

3213
02:02:18,980 --> 02:02:19,500
Money.

3214
02:02:22,320 --> 02:02:23,460
Did I miss anything?

3215
02:02:26,700 --> 02:02:27,780
Oh, there's more lore.

3216
02:02:28,120 --> 02:02:29,120
The Elrond's house.

3217
02:02:29,140 --> 02:02:30,440
You trusted the village to me today.

3218
02:02:30,680 --> 02:02:33,080
You told me I could learn my duties as I go.

3219
02:02:33,280 --> 02:02:35,440
I'll start by keeping a record of the village.

3220
02:02:35,760 --> 02:02:40,880
There's so many words I cannot write, but the Elder encouraged me.

3221
02:02:40,900 --> 02:02:41,880
I will do my best.

3222
02:02:42,320 --> 02:02:45,760
There is a young boy who lives in the cabin by the lake with his grandfather.

3223
02:02:46,160 --> 02:02:49,220
It seems that his mother was called to heaven upon his birth.

3224
02:02:49,420 --> 02:02:53,440
His grandfather doesn't talk much, but the lad is very bright and spirited.

3225
02:02:53,680 --> 02:02:57,620
He told me a story about a knight who rides a donkey again today.

3226
02:02:58,080 --> 02:02:59,120
The boy's grandfather told me a story about a knight who rides a donkey again today.

3227
02:03:02,500 --> 02:03:07,140
The boy worries terribly about him and there are murmurs of madness among the villagers.

3228
02:03:07,740 --> 02:03:13,880
As I took my leave, the old man pulled me aside and said, If anything happens, you know what to do.

3229
02:03:14,800 --> 02:03:16,800
I can only nod in response.

3230
02:03:18,540 --> 02:03:20,260
It was a terrible night.

3231
02:03:20,720 --> 02:03:24,380
Everyone stood around the cabin and watched as it burned to the ground.

3232
02:03:24,640 --> 02:03:27,280
The boy looked on without saying a word.

3233
02:03:27,280 --> 02:03:30,420
Even as dawn broke, he didn't move a muscle.

3234
02:03:30,600 --> 02:03:32,580
The next day, he was gone.

3235
02:03:32,820 --> 02:03:34,380
And then everyone clapped.

3236
02:03:36,920 --> 02:03:38,940
I missed a box over there?

3237
02:03:39,100 --> 02:03:40,480
Okay, let me check where it is.

3238
02:03:40,940 --> 02:03:41,740
Oh, there it is.

3239
02:03:45,260 --> 02:03:45,740
Nice.

3240
02:03:49,470 --> 02:03:50,670
Got an anti-camera.

3241
02:03:50,790 --> 02:03:52,050
What the fuck do I do with that?

3242
02:03:54,050 --> 02:03:56,670
Oh, this is the boy and his family.

3243
02:03:56,990 --> 02:03:57,630
That's him.

3244
02:03:58,170 --> 02:03:59,010
Wait, is that gonna be me?

3245
02:03:59,030 --> 02:04:00,210
Is that gonna be the short guy in the...

3246
02:04:00,690 --> 02:04:02,050
In the later on?

3247
02:04:02,230 --> 02:04:03,270
Did he grow up to be evil?

3248
02:04:04,610 --> 02:04:07,190
Did you grow up to be evil, little boy?

3249
02:04:14,410 --> 02:04:14,870
Alright.

3250
02:04:16,610 --> 02:04:20,330
Apparently you have to be spread out right now because of the wolf.

3251
02:04:22,090 --> 02:04:23,170
Alright, what do we got here?

3252
02:04:27,980 --> 02:04:29,340
There's the evil wolf.

3253
02:04:30,380 --> 02:04:33,860
I'm gonna say that and then the evil wolf is gonna fucking come out and like...

3254
02:04:33,860 --> 02:04:34,900
bite me or some shit.

3255
02:04:38,500 --> 02:04:41,420
Zondervan, you 1% seem the type to skip the lore.

3256
02:04:41,540 --> 02:04:42,660
What the heck is happening?

3257
02:04:42,800 --> 02:04:43,280
What do you mean?

3258
02:04:43,360 --> 02:04:44,620
I always read the lore!

3259
02:04:46,180 --> 02:04:47,120
It's the lore!

3260
02:04:47,340 --> 02:04:48,880
It's the lore pause!

3261
02:04:51,420 --> 02:04:54,140
The lore always gives us the fucking pauses!

3262
02:04:56,780 --> 02:04:58,000
It's the safe space!

3263
02:05:02,960 --> 02:05:03,820
Okay, guys.

3264
02:05:04,260 --> 02:05:05,480
Where's the evil dog?

3265
02:05:05,480 --> 02:05:06,700
Where's super dog?

3266
02:05:07,260 --> 02:05:09,160
Like, this is very important.

3267
02:05:09,320 --> 02:05:10,760
Where the fuck is super dog?

3268
02:05:13,060 --> 02:05:14,240
The lore breaks?

3269
02:05:14,360 --> 02:05:14,540
Yeah.

3270
02:05:19,320 --> 02:05:21,520
Okay, we're gonna save our game just in case.

3271
02:05:24,600 --> 02:05:25,520
Where outside?

3272
02:05:25,680 --> 02:05:26,460
The other outside?

3273
02:05:26,700 --> 02:05:27,340
This outside?

3274
02:05:27,900 --> 02:05:29,720
Is super dog on this side?

3275
02:05:34,120 --> 02:05:35,020
Super dog.

3276
02:05:36,180 --> 02:05:37,140
Super dog.

3277
02:05:38,360 --> 02:05:39,940
Super dog, are you here?

3278
02:05:46,520 --> 02:05:47,300
Super dog!

3279
02:05:51,380 --> 02:05:52,460
Super dog!

3280
02:05:52,960 --> 02:05:55,060
Super dog!

3281
02:05:55,060 --> 02:05:56,180
Oh, I hear him.

3282
02:05:56,940 --> 02:05:58,720
I hear super dog.

3283
02:06:02,940 --> 02:06:04,780
He's on the other side!

3284
02:06:11,860 --> 02:06:12,860
What the fuck?

3285
02:06:12,860 --> 02:06:13,900
He's on the other side?

3286
02:06:14,420 --> 02:06:16,060
Super dog's on the other side.

3287
02:06:16,440 --> 02:06:17,660
When did he get there?

3288
02:06:20,620 --> 02:06:21,660
I heard him.

3289
02:06:21,680 --> 02:06:22,070
He barked.

3290
02:06:22,720 --> 02:06:23,840
Super dog died.

3291
02:06:23,860 --> 02:06:24,300
He barked.

3292
02:06:24,580 --> 02:06:26,500
But it wasn't like the scary bark.

3293
02:06:26,620 --> 02:06:27,340
He just went...

3294
02:06:28,080 --> 02:06:30,080
Wait, I missed the treasure.

3295
02:06:30,320 --> 02:06:30,820
Okay, guys.

3296
02:06:30,840 --> 02:06:31,640
Where's the treasure again?

3297
02:06:31,900 --> 02:06:32,760
I already forgot.

3298
02:06:33,620 --> 02:06:34,300
I forgot.

3299
02:06:37,320 --> 02:06:40,000
Is that on the first floor or the second floor?

3300
02:06:41,260 --> 02:06:42,180
Oh, there it is.

3301
02:06:43,240 --> 02:06:44,160
Alright, I got it.

3302
02:06:44,280 --> 02:06:45,600
I know I missed something here.

3303
02:06:48,880 --> 02:06:49,540
Super dog!

3304
02:06:50,240 --> 02:06:51,160
Where are you?

3305
02:06:51,160 --> 02:06:51,980
There you are!

3306
02:06:53,840 --> 02:06:55,000
Get over here!

3307
02:06:56,200 --> 02:06:57,180
Open the door!

3308
02:06:57,600 --> 02:06:59,060
Wait, can I just shoot you from here?

3309
02:06:59,980 --> 02:07:00,660
Super dog!

3310
02:07:00,940 --> 02:07:01,520
Come back!

3311
02:07:03,580 --> 02:07:04,480
Super dog!

3312
02:07:04,580 --> 02:07:05,200
Come back!

3313
02:07:05,260 --> 02:07:06,000
Super dog!

3314
02:07:08,220 --> 02:07:09,280
Where did you go?

3315
02:07:10,640 --> 02:07:11,760
Where did he go?

3316
02:07:14,180 --> 02:07:15,760
Where the fuck did he go?

3317
02:07:19,080 --> 02:07:19,620
Hehehe.

3318
02:07:19,620 --> 02:07:19,900
Hehehe.

3319
02:07:23,740 --> 02:07:24,800
Where are you?

3320
02:07:26,600 --> 02:07:27,440
Super dog?

3321
02:07:33,680 --> 02:07:34,200
BANG!

3322
02:07:41,960 --> 02:07:43,900
This is super duper dog!

3323
02:07:46,420 --> 02:07:48,440
Oh my god, super duper dog can dodge.

3324
02:07:48,620 --> 02:07:50,100
Super duper dog can dodge!

3325
02:07:50,320 --> 02:07:52,140
What the fuck is wrong with this dog?

3326
02:07:59,900 --> 02:08:01,700
I said goodbye!

3327
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:04,400
I said goodbye!

3328
02:08:05,620 --> 02:08:07,060
What do you mean?

3329
02:08:07,380 --> 02:08:09,000
What do you mean?

3330
02:08:17,540 --> 02:08:20,380
What is wrong with SuperDuperDog?

3331
02:08:23,740 --> 02:08:25,500
Oh my god!

3332
02:08:29,080 --> 02:08:30,880
Jesus Christ!

3333
02:08:32,340 --> 02:08:34,740
He said no.

3334
02:08:35,180 --> 02:08:38,260
I should have used the sniper jab.

3335
02:08:39,560 --> 02:08:41,160
Oh my god.

3336
02:08:41,600 --> 02:08:43,200
That shit was scary.

3337
02:08:44,220 --> 02:08:47,160
He really was the SuperDog.

3338
02:08:48,460 --> 02:08:49,980
Jesus Christ.

3339
02:08:50,380 --> 02:08:51,780
I don't know how I lived there.

3340
02:08:51,840 --> 02:08:52,760
She screamed Leon.

3341
02:08:53,220 --> 02:08:54,300
I was like, what?

3342
02:08:57,840 --> 02:08:59,240
Yeah, I did.

3343
02:08:59,480 --> 02:09:01,020
I definitely did.

3344
02:09:01,640 --> 02:09:04,220
There's no SuperDog in Ba Sing Se.

3345
02:09:04,640 --> 02:09:06,180
Thank you for the super chat.

3346
02:09:06,240 --> 02:09:07,140
Thank you.

3347
02:09:08,580 --> 02:09:09,620
Jesus Christ.

3348
02:09:15,100 --> 02:09:16,560
There's nothing worth it.

3349
02:09:20,380 --> 02:09:21,340
Okay, we're gonna sell that.

3350
02:09:21,560 --> 02:09:22,980
Oh wait, no, I can sell these two.

3351
02:09:23,140 --> 02:09:23,380
Okay.

3352
02:09:24,500 --> 02:09:26,040
Anti-camera, we got that.

3353
02:09:26,760 --> 02:09:27,240
Nice.

3354
02:09:27,300 --> 02:09:27,600
Okay.

3355
02:09:28,380 --> 02:09:31,320
Is it worth buying the rocket launcher or nah?

3356
02:09:31,640 --> 02:09:32,720
Is it worth it?

3357
02:09:33,620 --> 02:09:38,340
Is it worth it, guys?

3358
02:09:38,580 --> 02:09:39,300
Or nah?

3359
02:09:39,500 --> 02:09:39,780
Nah?

3360
02:09:39,960 --> 02:09:40,340
Okay.

3361
02:09:40,560 --> 02:09:41,160
No, okay.

3362
02:09:41,780 --> 02:09:42,260
Nah.

3363
02:09:42,960 --> 02:09:43,440
Okay.

3364
02:09:43,600 --> 02:09:46,840
Apparently, some people are like, no, and some people are like, nah.

3365
02:09:49,340 --> 02:09:50,180
Rocket launcher...

3366
02:09:50,180 --> 02:09:50,320
Rocket launcher...

3367
02:09:50,320 --> 02:09:52,640
But I have... I have my rifle!

3368
02:09:53,340 --> 02:09:54,780
My rifle though!

3369
02:09:54,920 --> 02:09:57,260
Okay, we'll trade for the mask and then we can sell.

3370
02:09:57,720 --> 02:09:59,700
Do I have enough though for it?

3371
02:09:59,720 --> 02:10:00,860
It is... Is it circle?

3372
02:10:01,500 --> 02:10:02,020
Round.

3373
02:10:02,160 --> 02:10:04,380
Okay, I don't have enough round stuff for that.

3374
02:10:04,400 --> 02:10:04,660
Okay.

3375
02:10:05,380 --> 02:10:07,860
We're gonna find more jewels later.

3376
02:10:10,620 --> 02:10:11,140
Alright.

3377
02:10:13,160 --> 02:10:13,680
Man.

3378
02:10:13,960 --> 02:10:16,620
Luke, I almost missed out on... Oh wait, there's more money!

3379
02:10:18,200 --> 02:10:19,320
I can sell more stuff.

3380
02:10:20,620 --> 02:10:21,480
Okay, nice.

3381
02:10:21,620 --> 02:10:22,500
Okay, now...

3382
02:10:22,980 --> 02:10:24,000
Now we save again.

3383
02:10:25,120 --> 02:10:26,380
Now we save again.

3384
02:10:26,540 --> 02:10:27,280
Guys, don't worry.

3385
02:10:27,340 --> 02:10:28,900
We will... We will get to another...

3386
02:10:28,900 --> 02:10:30,620
I swear, we will get to another chapter.

3387
02:10:34,020 --> 02:10:35,580
Guys, don't worry.

3388
02:10:35,860 --> 02:10:38,720
We will get to another chapter soon.

3389
02:10:39,100 --> 02:10:40,460
Guys, do not worry.

3390
02:10:42,040 --> 02:10:43,180
Did you max out?

3391
02:10:43,240 --> 02:10:44,680
I'm pretty sure I maxed it out.

3392
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:45,660
Let's check.

3393
02:10:47,160 --> 02:10:50,060
Yeah, everything's maxed... Everything that matters maxed out.

3394
02:10:50,640 --> 02:10:52,440
I might as well max out the shock.

3395
02:10:52,620 --> 02:10:52,920
Nah!

3396
02:10:54,440 --> 02:10:56,660
Will I be finding a better shotgun soon?

3397
02:11:01,880 --> 02:11:03,340
Are we gonna...

3398
02:11:03,960 --> 02:11:06,280
get a better shotgun soon or should we...

3399
02:11:06,840 --> 02:11:07,100
just...

3400
02:11:07,960 --> 02:11:08,480
Yeah?

3401
02:11:08,960 --> 02:11:09,900
When what chapter?

3402
02:11:11,460 --> 02:11:12,660
Yes, very soon?

3403
02:11:12,860 --> 02:11:13,160
Okay.

3404
02:11:13,600 --> 02:11:15,320
Alright, I won't upgrade it.

3405
02:11:15,360 --> 02:11:16,300
I don't want to waste money then.

3406
02:11:16,700 --> 02:11:18,100
I'll just upgrade the knife.

3407
02:11:18,300 --> 02:11:19,400
Like, might as well.

3408
02:11:19,400 --> 02:11:20,380
I'm gonna fix the knife.

3409
02:11:20,540 --> 02:11:21,260
Alright, there we go.

3410
02:11:21,320 --> 02:11:23,040
As long as we max out the knife, it's fine.

3411
02:11:23,200 --> 02:11:25,480
I don't need the better rate of fire.

3412
02:11:25,880 --> 02:11:26,380
Honestly.

3413
02:11:26,940 --> 02:11:29,400
The rate of fire is like...

3414
02:11:29,400 --> 02:11:29,880
Um...

3415
02:11:30,350 --> 02:11:33,200
I like... Someone's like, it's next chapter, so not soon.

3416
02:11:37,880 --> 02:11:38,580
That's true.

3417
02:11:38,760 --> 02:11:39,260
True!

3418
02:11:39,900 --> 02:11:41,060
That is so true.

3419
02:11:41,480 --> 02:11:43,060
That is so true.

3420
02:11:44,180 --> 02:11:45,760
It's not gonna be soon.

3421
02:11:49,400 --> 02:11:50,520
Alright, here we go.

3422
02:11:52,460 --> 02:11:53,900
We're gonna finally go up.

3423
02:11:54,580 --> 02:11:55,320
Ah, fuck.

3424
02:11:55,380 --> 02:11:55,920
It's this way.

3425
02:11:58,800 --> 02:11:59,940
Alright, let's go.

3426
02:12:00,780 --> 02:12:02,360
How do we get up top again?

3427
02:12:02,860 --> 02:12:03,640
Oh, ladder.

3428
02:12:04,780 --> 02:12:05,600
Here we go.

3429
02:12:06,800 --> 02:12:09,980
I remember I... I like, ran for this one.

3430
02:12:10,140 --> 02:12:11,380
I didn't kill everybody.

3431
02:12:11,920 --> 02:12:12,440
Hahaha!

3432
02:12:13,540 --> 02:12:14,060
Hahaha!

3433
02:12:14,880 --> 02:12:15,400
Hahaha!

3434
02:12:15,740 --> 02:12:16,520
Don't leave me!

3435
02:12:16,600 --> 02:12:18,320
This time I killed everyone.

3436
02:12:18,320 --> 02:12:19,260
Where are you?

3437
02:12:20,500 --> 02:12:21,400
Oh, there you are.

3438
02:12:24,880 --> 02:12:25,700
I've learned.

3439
02:12:26,080 --> 02:12:26,460
Hahaha!

3440
02:12:30,540 --> 02:12:31,520
Alright, here we go.

3441
02:12:34,720 --> 02:12:35,800
Is there more people?

3442
02:12:37,900 --> 02:12:39,260
Ah, there's more people.

3443
02:12:40,560 --> 02:12:41,380
Okay, that's fine.

3444
02:12:41,420 --> 02:12:42,400
We have ammo here.

3445
02:12:42,840 --> 02:12:43,620
Where are they?

3446
02:12:48,180 --> 02:12:49,340
Oh, you wanna dodge?

3447
02:12:49,480 --> 02:12:50,100
Don't worry.

3448
02:12:50,320 --> 02:12:50,620
I... Oh.

3449
02:12:50,620 --> 02:12:50,760
Oh.

3450
02:12:50,760 --> 02:12:51,180
Oh.

3451
02:12:51,320 --> 02:12:51,980
Oh, God.

3452
02:12:52,060 --> 02:12:52,260
Okay.

3453
02:12:52,740 --> 02:12:53,280
Kick!

3454
02:12:53,920 --> 02:12:54,460
Nice.

3455
02:12:55,480 --> 02:12:56,320
Okay, sap!

3456
02:12:56,540 --> 02:12:56,980
No.

3457
02:12:57,100 --> 02:12:57,640
No.

3458
02:12:57,800 --> 02:12:58,340
No.

3459
02:12:58,400 --> 02:12:58,880
No!

3460
02:12:58,960 --> 02:13:00,120
I couldn't get the sap!

3461
02:13:00,680 --> 02:13:01,220
No!

3462
02:13:02,240 --> 02:13:02,780
Ashley!

3463
02:13:04,020 --> 02:13:04,560
Ashley!

3464
02:13:05,460 --> 02:13:06,600
I'm so sorry!

3465
02:13:06,640 --> 02:13:08,020
I couldn't get the sap in time!

3466
02:13:11,960 --> 02:13:13,240
No, my shotgun.

3467
02:13:15,220 --> 02:13:16,620
Oh, my God.

3468
02:13:16,840 --> 02:13:18,340
I don't know what happened!

3469
02:13:18,640 --> 02:13:20,940
The sap didn't show up!

3470
02:13:21,040 --> 02:13:21,460
Hahaha!

3471
02:13:25,180 --> 02:13:25,440
Hahaha!

3472
02:13:27,100 --> 02:13:28,860
What the fuck happened?

3473
02:13:29,460 --> 02:13:30,120
Hahaha!

3474
02:13:30,980 --> 02:13:33,140
My shotgun ammo!

3475
02:13:34,260 --> 02:13:36,360
Oh, my shotgun ammo!

3476
02:13:36,800 --> 02:13:37,540
No!

3477
02:13:40,240 --> 02:13:41,120
No!

3478
02:13:43,080 --> 02:13:43,520
No!

3479
02:13:48,980 --> 02:13:52,160
A beautiful shotgun ammo.

3480
02:13:52,300 --> 02:13:53,720
What the fuck is that?

3481
02:13:53,840 --> 02:13:54,560
Is that the cow?

3482
02:13:59,150 --> 02:14:00,350
That's the strongman!

3483
02:14:02,330 --> 02:14:04,070
This is what the rifle is for.

3484
02:14:05,990 --> 02:14:06,470
Nice.

3485
02:14:06,470 --> 02:14:06,930
He's dead.

3486
02:14:08,690 --> 02:14:09,170
Alright.

3487
02:14:09,830 --> 02:14:10,650
There we go.

3488
02:14:10,890 --> 02:14:12,590
I mean, the cows are still alive.

3489
02:14:12,850 --> 02:14:13,630
Good for them.

3490
02:14:15,730 --> 02:14:16,630
Good for them.

3491
02:14:16,670 --> 02:14:18,930
The cows are still fucking tanking it.

3492
02:14:21,250 --> 02:14:23,070
Okay, we're gonna be living in poverty soon.

3493
02:14:23,390 --> 02:14:25,270
Remember when we had like 80 at...

3494
02:14:25,270 --> 02:14:25,990
How?

3495
02:14:26,390 --> 02:14:26,870
How?

3496
02:14:27,290 --> 02:14:27,770
How?

3497
02:14:27,790 --> 02:14:27,950
How?

3498
02:14:27,950 --> 02:14:28,210
How?

3499
02:14:28,210 --> 02:14:28,970
How?

3500
02:14:30,590 --> 02:14:31,150
How?

3501
02:14:31,450 --> 02:14:32,430
How the fuck?

3502
02:14:32,530 --> 02:14:33,070
How?

3503
02:14:33,410 --> 02:14:35,030
That was point blank.

3504
02:14:35,990 --> 02:14:38,150
Guys, remember when we had 80 bullets?

3505
02:14:38,930 --> 02:14:39,850
I'll remember.

3506
02:14:42,110 --> 02:14:42,670
How?

3507
02:14:43,050 --> 02:14:43,610
How?

3508
02:14:44,010 --> 02:14:44,950
There's no way.

3509
02:14:45,110 --> 02:14:46,330
There's no fucking way.

3510
02:14:46,670 --> 02:14:48,050
There's no fucking way.

3511
02:14:49,570 --> 02:14:50,130
Please.

3512
02:14:50,650 --> 02:14:52,390
Please give me a chance to make it.

3513
02:14:55,910 --> 02:14:56,970
Okay, there you go.

3514
02:14:57,230 --> 02:14:57,790
Please.

3515
02:14:57,790 --> 02:14:59,130
Oh, thank god.

3516
02:14:59,170 --> 02:14:59,370
Okay.

3517
02:15:00,470 --> 02:15:01,210
Thank god.

3518
02:15:01,230 --> 02:15:01,490
Okay.

3519
02:15:01,870 --> 02:15:03,110
Everything is fine.

3520
02:15:03,490 --> 02:15:05,890
Everything is fine.

3521
02:15:07,630 --> 02:15:08,870
I have the key!

3522
02:15:12,290 --> 02:15:12,790
Money!

3523
02:15:12,870 --> 02:15:13,270
Oh, sorry.

3524
02:15:13,350 --> 02:15:14,010
Did I stab you?

3525
02:15:14,170 --> 02:15:15,490
Wait, can I actually hurt her?

3526
02:15:19,690 --> 02:15:20,690
Holy shit.

3527
02:15:20,770 --> 02:15:23,850
We are so fucking poverty right now.

3528
02:15:25,150 --> 02:15:26,490
Oh my god.

3529
02:15:26,490 --> 02:15:27,490
Okay.

3530
02:15:27,970 --> 02:15:28,530
Maybe...

3531
02:15:28,530 --> 02:15:29,070
No.

3532
02:15:29,230 --> 02:15:29,650
Okay.

3533
02:15:29,770 --> 02:15:31,090
We are so fucking poor.

3534
02:15:31,410 --> 02:15:31,970
Alright.

3535
02:15:32,670 --> 02:15:34,130
I need to stop shooting.

3536
02:15:34,370 --> 02:15:36,550
I need to stop shooting.

3537
02:15:38,330 --> 02:15:39,770
We are so poor.

3538
02:15:40,190 --> 02:15:43,590
I remember when we used to rule the world.

3539
02:15:44,250 --> 02:15:45,050
Hello, piggy.

3540
02:15:46,150 --> 02:15:46,950
Hello, cow.

3541
02:15:48,010 --> 02:15:49,670
There's like loot here somewhere.

3542
02:15:51,970 --> 02:15:52,830
Oh, it is.

3543
02:15:53,790 --> 02:15:54,550
Hey, look.

3544
02:15:54,610 --> 02:15:55,010
I know.

3545
02:15:55,510 --> 02:15:56,070
No!

3546
02:15:56,070 --> 02:15:56,470
No!

3547
02:15:56,470 --> 02:15:58,290
I fucking forgot about this!

3548
02:15:58,690 --> 02:15:59,630
What the?

3549
02:15:59,830 --> 02:16:01,090
I couldn't see!

3550
02:16:03,340 --> 02:16:04,660
I'm so sad.

3551
02:16:04,900 --> 02:16:06,780
I'm so fucking sad.

3552
02:16:07,180 --> 02:16:08,620
It was so dark, guys.

3553
02:16:08,700 --> 02:16:09,660
I couldn't see.

3554
02:16:10,360 --> 02:16:12,120
It was so dark.

3555
02:16:12,320 --> 02:16:13,580
I couldn't see!

3556
02:16:18,640 --> 02:16:21,020
It was so dark.

3557
02:16:22,280 --> 02:16:24,960
How was I supposed to know?

3558
02:16:25,180 --> 02:16:25,960
Well.

3559
02:16:26,880 --> 02:16:28,400
This is so much fun.

3560
02:16:31,040 --> 02:16:32,580
Okay, we gotta save our game.

3561
02:16:36,280 --> 02:16:37,100
Nice, alright.

3562
02:16:37,780 --> 02:16:39,180
Alright, Ashley, it's time.

3563
02:16:40,060 --> 02:16:44,440
We're a little bit in the poverty line right now, but it's okay.

3564
02:16:45,380 --> 02:16:47,040
Everything will be okay.

3565
02:16:49,800 --> 02:16:51,520
You... you getting hurt?

3566
02:16:52,920 --> 02:16:56,940
Are you fucking... are you fucking kidding me?!

3567
02:16:56,940 --> 02:16:57,800
You fu-

3568
02:17:01,380 --> 02:17:02,540
What's gonna happen?

3569
02:17:02,640 --> 02:17:05,780
The cow is gonna fucking run into her again, right?

3570
02:17:05,960 --> 02:17:06,960
What's gonna happen?

3571
02:17:07,320 --> 02:17:09,160
Are you fucking- it's a cow!

3572
02:17:11,680 --> 02:17:14,760
Oh my god, are you fucking kidding me?

3573
02:17:14,900 --> 02:17:15,980
Ashley, please.

3574
02:17:17,800 --> 02:17:19,000
Ashley, please.

3575
02:17:20,580 --> 02:17:21,180
Ashley.

3576
02:17:21,840 --> 02:17:22,680
Where is he?

3577
02:17:22,880 --> 02:17:23,560
Oh, there he is.

3578
02:17:25,080 --> 02:17:26,600
Oh my god.

3579
02:17:26,780 --> 02:17:29,460
That- fucking damn it, Ashley.

3580
02:17:30,140 --> 02:17:33,200
I can't- I can't deal with you, man.

3581
02:17:36,860 --> 02:17:38,440
Okay, let's see.

3582
02:17:38,560 --> 02:17:41,920
Do you have- can I not buy ammo from you?

3583
02:17:42,060 --> 02:17:43,000
This is not fair!

3584
02:17:44,140 --> 02:17:47,840
I should be allowed to purchase ammo from you!

3585
02:17:48,300 --> 02:17:48,820
Like...

3586
02:17:51,440 --> 02:17:53,360
Cause of death, cow.

3587
02:17:57,460 --> 02:17:58,960
Okay, is there anything else?

3588
02:17:58,960 --> 02:18:00,040
I think I've done everything.

3589
02:18:00,500 --> 02:18:01,220
I can.

3590
02:18:02,340 --> 02:18:03,960
Yeah, it's all over.

3591
02:18:04,060 --> 02:18:04,520
It's okay.

3592
02:18:04,920 --> 02:18:06,540
Alright, we're gonna go in.

3593
02:18:06,720 --> 02:18:10,140
We're gonna be like below the poverty line.

3594
02:18:10,600 --> 02:18:11,660
But like...

3595
02:18:13,860 --> 02:18:15,940
God, I hope the president pays well.

3596
02:18:16,720 --> 02:18:19,520
I hope he doesn't just give me a medal.

3597
02:18:23,600 --> 02:18:25,160
Oh shit, bro!

3598
02:18:27,120 --> 02:18:27,700
Bro!

3599
02:18:30,540 --> 02:18:32,020
Major, thank you for the super chat!

3600
02:18:32,100 --> 02:18:32,960
Thank you, thank you!

3601
02:18:32,980 --> 02:18:35,220
Wonderful, great entertainment like every time.

3602
02:18:35,280 --> 02:18:35,960
Thank you!

3603
02:18:36,060 --> 02:18:37,300
I'm glad you've been enjoying it!

3604
02:18:44,560 --> 02:18:47,080
Bro, I don't want the medal of honor, Mr. President.

3605
02:18:47,180 --> 02:18:48,320
Just give me a hundred grand.

3606
02:18:52,040 --> 02:18:56,480
I wonder if it's legal to sell your medal of honor from the president.

3607
02:18:58,280 --> 02:18:59,100
Hello, Luis.

3608
02:19:01,320 --> 02:19:02,080
Now then.

3609
02:19:03,320 --> 02:19:04,320
Who are you?

3610
02:19:04,720 --> 02:19:05,860
And what are you doing here?

3611
02:19:06,140 --> 02:19:06,580
Damn.

3612
02:19:07,020 --> 02:19:07,760
Very good questions, Luis.

3613
02:19:07,760 --> 02:19:09,080
You like, copied on him.

3614
02:19:11,340 --> 02:19:12,220
Hide, now.

3615
02:19:13,680 --> 02:19:14,920
In that case...

3616
02:19:14,920 --> 02:19:16,420
Here, help me.

3617
02:19:17,140 --> 02:19:17,820
Ashley, quick!

3618
02:19:18,220 --> 02:19:18,880
Over here.

3619
02:19:25,460 --> 02:19:27,300
Yeah, but you don't want to pawn shop it.

3620
02:19:27,340 --> 02:19:29,380
You want to put it online to sell.

3621
02:19:29,660 --> 02:19:31,780
Cause the pawn shop will always rip you off.

3622
02:19:31,960 --> 02:19:34,900
If I ever get a medal of honor, make sure to look at eBay.

3623
02:19:35,920 --> 02:19:36,240
Hahaha!

3624
02:19:42,060 --> 02:19:43,680
Look at eBay.

3625
02:19:44,100 --> 02:19:45,160
And waifu.

3626
02:19:45,260 --> 02:19:45,580
Hahaha!

3627
02:19:49,900 --> 02:19:50,740
Okay.

3628
02:19:55,640 --> 02:19:56,480
Alright.

3629
02:19:56,720 --> 02:19:57,260
Use.

3630
02:20:02,120 --> 02:20:03,920
Where the fuck do I...

3631
02:20:08,710 --> 02:20:09,490
Okay, nice.

3632
02:20:11,830 --> 02:20:12,310
Okay.

3633
02:20:12,570 --> 02:20:13,410
This is it.

3634
02:20:13,490 --> 02:20:13,990
Boom.

3635
02:20:14,550 --> 02:20:15,670
Oh shit!

3636
02:20:15,730 --> 02:20:16,970
Where did you come from?

3637
02:20:21,170 --> 02:20:21,750
Bam!

3638
02:20:22,730 --> 02:20:23,670
Oh shit.

3639
02:20:23,750 --> 02:20:24,070
Cut!

3640
02:20:25,150 --> 02:20:25,970
Oh shit.

3641
02:20:26,090 --> 02:20:26,350
Cut!

3642
02:20:29,350 --> 02:20:30,110
Oh god.

3643
02:20:30,210 --> 02:20:31,130
It's the window time.

3644
02:20:31,310 --> 02:20:32,510
It's window time!

3645
02:20:37,270 --> 02:20:38,150
Oh god.

3646
02:20:38,250 --> 02:20:38,770
Reloading!

3647
02:20:39,830 --> 02:20:40,410
Yes!

3648
02:20:41,590 --> 02:20:42,590
Give me ammo!

3649
02:20:48,860 --> 02:20:49,680
Shoot him!

3650
02:20:55,120 --> 02:20:55,680
Oh god.

3651
02:20:55,740 --> 02:20:56,020
Oh god.

3652
02:20:56,100 --> 02:20:56,220
Oh god.

3653
02:21:00,070 --> 02:21:00,650
Oh god.

3654
02:21:00,710 --> 02:21:01,010
Oh god.

3655
02:21:01,070 --> 02:21:01,430
This is it!

3656
02:21:01,550 --> 02:21:01,910
Need time!

3657
02:21:03,070 --> 02:21:03,450
Okay.

3658
02:21:03,550 --> 02:21:05,010
Now I have to fucking shortcut this.

3659
02:21:05,770 --> 02:21:06,830
Oh, why did I sell?

3660
02:21:08,670 --> 02:21:09,690
Why did I sell?

3661
02:21:10,270 --> 02:21:10,650
Why?

3662
02:21:11,050 --> 02:21:11,770
Nice throw it.

3663
02:21:11,810 --> 02:21:11,970
Yeah.

3664
02:21:12,010 --> 02:21:12,290
Nice.

3665
02:21:12,330 --> 02:21:12,570
Okay.

3666
02:21:13,070 --> 02:21:15,310
Why did I sell my flash?

3667
02:21:19,650 --> 02:21:20,030
Wait.

3668
02:21:20,090 --> 02:21:20,650
I got loot here.

3669
02:21:21,130 --> 02:21:21,750
Go, Louis!

3670
02:21:21,810 --> 02:21:22,010
Go!

3671
02:21:23,010 --> 02:21:24,290
I'm just grabbing some ammo!

3672
02:21:26,470 --> 02:21:26,850
Boom!

3673
02:21:27,030 --> 02:21:27,410
Oh, I'm so lucky.

3674
02:21:27,410 --> 02:21:27,490
Haha!

3675
02:21:27,870 --> 02:21:29,570
Oh shit, that's not what I wanted.

3676
02:21:30,770 --> 02:21:31,390
Oh god.

3677
02:21:31,490 --> 02:21:31,890
I need to reload.

3678
02:21:32,190 --> 02:21:33,150
I need to re- Louis!

3679
02:21:33,250 --> 02:21:34,290
That's a fucking barrel!

3680
02:21:35,970 --> 02:21:36,390
Okay.

3681
02:21:36,430 --> 02:21:36,590
That's okay.

3682
02:21:36,790 --> 02:21:37,150
Kick!

3683
02:21:39,290 --> 02:21:40,350
Oh, not good.

3684
02:21:40,450 --> 02:21:40,830
Not good.

3685
02:21:41,470 --> 02:21:42,130
Not good.

3686
02:21:42,250 --> 02:21:42,590
Not good.

3687
02:21:43,770 --> 02:21:44,490
Not good.

3688
02:21:44,630 --> 02:21:44,930
Not good!

3689
02:21:47,690 --> 02:21:49,550
Can Louis give me ammo for this?

3690
02:21:49,810 --> 02:21:50,950
No, it's only handguns only.

3691
02:21:51,150 --> 02:21:52,610
It's handguns only apparently!

3692
02:21:52,990 --> 02:21:54,550
It's handguns only apparently!

3693
02:21:56,010 --> 02:21:59,660
It's handguns only apparently!

3694
02:22:00,220 --> 02:22:01,540
Oh god, more wooden planks, nice.

3695
02:22:07,110 --> 02:22:09,210
It's okay, I'm gonna reinforce this!

3696
02:22:09,790 --> 02:22:10,390
Nice.

3697
02:22:11,270 --> 02:22:11,870
Alright.

3698
02:22:12,250 --> 02:22:14,590
Now he can only go one way.

3699
02:22:14,650 --> 02:22:16,050
Where did he come from?!

3700
02:22:18,150 --> 02:22:18,750
Okay.

3701
02:22:19,910 --> 02:22:20,510
Oh!

3702
02:22:20,510 --> 02:22:21,110
Shit!

3703
02:22:21,350 --> 02:22:21,950
Yes!

3704
02:22:22,910 --> 02:22:27,660
Oh no, he has ladder!

3705
02:22:28,720 --> 02:22:30,860
Where are you gonna come from?!

3706
02:22:30,860 --> 02:22:32,400
The stairs?!

3707
02:22:34,080 --> 02:22:35,340
Oh shit, okay.

3708
02:22:35,340 --> 02:22:35,520
Okay.

3709
02:22:35,920 --> 02:22:37,360
Okay, give me a sec.

3710
02:22:38,280 --> 02:22:39,360
I'm going up.

3711
02:22:40,160 --> 02:22:41,000
Leon, why?

3712
02:22:41,140 --> 02:22:43,000
Why did you pause?!

3713
02:22:43,980 --> 02:22:44,500
AHHHHH!

3714
02:22:45,640 --> 02:22:46,520
I'm sorry!

3715
02:22:47,100 --> 02:22:48,620
I'm sorry, Ulysses!

3716
02:22:48,880 --> 02:22:49,880
Oh shit!

3717
02:22:50,040 --> 02:22:51,660
Okay, this is time for heal time.

3718
02:22:52,180 --> 02:22:54,080
This is good time for heal time.

3719
02:22:56,180 --> 02:22:57,220
This is...

3720
02:22:57,220 --> 02:22:58,680
Oh, it's time!

3721
02:22:59,460 --> 02:23:00,280
Oh shit!

3722
02:23:00,400 --> 02:23:00,860
It's time!

3723
02:23:00,940 --> 02:23:02,040
I don't remember my shortcut!

3724
02:23:02,300 --> 02:23:04,400
I don't remember my shortcut bindings!

3725
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:07,200
Ah, this is it!

3726
02:23:07,840 --> 02:23:08,080
Uh!

3727
02:23:08,880 --> 02:23:09,440
Fuck!

3728
02:23:09,460 --> 02:23:10,540
Okay, let me....

3729
02:23:12,620 --> 02:23:13,740
I'm trying!

3730
02:23:15,080 --> 02:23:15,640
Equip!

3731
02:23:15,700 --> 02:23:16,260
Boom!

3732
02:23:16,700 --> 02:23:18,560
If you die it's not my fault.

3733
02:23:23,760 --> 02:23:24,320
Okay.

3734
02:23:26,940 --> 02:23:28,180
There you go.

3735
02:23:28,640 --> 02:23:29,400
It's fine.

3736
02:23:29,660 --> 02:23:30,480
The eggs!

3737
02:23:30,740 --> 02:23:32,740
This is why we have the eggs!

3738
02:23:36,820 --> 02:23:37,820
It's daytime!

3739
02:23:38,400 --> 02:23:40,420
If you die, it's not my fault!

3740
02:23:45,240 --> 02:23:45,960
Okay.

3741
02:23:46,820 --> 02:23:47,540
Okay.

3742
02:23:48,440 --> 02:23:48,900
It's fine.

3743
02:23:51,560 --> 02:23:52,280
Nice!

3744
02:23:53,060 --> 02:23:53,560
There ya go.

3745
02:23:55,880 --> 02:23:56,600
Please!

3746
02:23:56,880 --> 02:23:58,100
Oh, please!

3747
02:24:03,500 --> 02:24:04,420
Oh, God.

3748
02:24:04,420 --> 02:24:07,400
Yes, I am very busy.

3749
02:24:13,420 --> 02:24:14,340
Oh, God.

3750
02:24:15,640 --> 02:24:16,640
Oh, God.

3751
02:24:18,040 --> 02:24:19,080
Oh, God.

3752
02:24:19,080 --> 02:24:19,520
Oh, God.

3753
02:24:21,040 --> 02:24:23,120
What the fuck!

3754
02:24:23,140 --> 02:24:24,720
He one-shots me!

3755
02:24:25,080 --> 02:24:26,600
Where's my egg?

3756
02:24:30,200 --> 02:24:30,960
Bros, give me the ammo!

3757
02:24:31,680 --> 02:24:34,120
Bro, give me the ammo!

3758
02:24:34,420 --> 02:24:36,160
Luis, if you die, I'm sorry.

3759
02:24:36,500 --> 02:24:38,360
I'm so sorry if you die.

3760
02:24:41,700 --> 02:24:42,780
Oh, God.

3761
02:24:42,920 --> 02:24:44,100
Oh, God.

3762
02:24:46,160 --> 02:24:47,200
Oh, God.

3763
02:24:50,240 --> 02:24:51,280
Okay, we're fine.

3764
02:24:51,380 --> 02:24:51,720
We're fine.

3765
02:24:56,560 --> 02:24:58,180
Oh, thank you!

3766
02:24:58,320 --> 02:24:59,320
Holy shit!

3767
02:25:00,040 --> 02:25:01,780
Ashley, door saved me!

3768
02:25:03,700 --> 02:25:08,300
The moment I saw the axe come straight to me.

3769
02:25:08,500 --> 02:25:10,900
I was like, this is the moment!

3770
02:25:15,700 --> 02:25:17,260
I was like, this is the moment!

3771
02:25:17,260 --> 02:25:17,720
The fuck!

3772
02:25:17,860 --> 02:25:19,040
Holy shit!

3773
02:25:19,560 --> 02:25:19,640
The fuck!

3774
02:25:22,340 --> 02:25:25,040
Ashley, it was good timing!

3775
02:25:25,220 --> 02:25:25,560
Ashley, it was good timing!

3776
02:25:25,560 --> 02:25:26,000
Good timing!

3777
02:25:27,120 --> 02:25:28,420
The clutch!

3778
02:25:29,040 --> 02:25:30,500
The clutch!

3779
02:25:32,350 --> 02:25:34,780
Finally, Ashley did something useful.

3780
02:25:35,420 --> 02:25:36,700
Bro, where you go?

3781
02:25:36,700 --> 02:25:38,580
Oh, cause they injected her with stuff.

3782
02:25:39,520 --> 02:25:41,860
I was saved by the plot.

3783
02:25:42,040 --> 02:25:46,240
The moment I saw the axe, I knew.

3784
02:25:47,140 --> 02:25:47,320
The moment I saw the axe, I knew.

3785
02:25:47,320 --> 02:25:47,660
The cough.

3786
02:25:48,260 --> 02:25:49,080
The blood.

3787
02:25:49,360 --> 02:25:51,420
It's caused by something called the...

3788
02:25:51,420 --> 02:25:52,520
Plaga.

3789
02:25:53,860 --> 02:25:54,900
The Plaga?

3790
02:25:55,280 --> 02:25:59,320
You saw those people, right?

3791
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,360
But you have the same thing inside you.

3792
02:26:02,820 --> 02:26:05,320
The same thing that made them like that.

3793
02:26:05,320 --> 02:26:06,840
Wait, we're gonna turn like them?

3794
02:26:07,160 --> 02:26:09,020
The guys which are experiencing these symptoms.

3795
02:26:10,160 --> 02:26:11,180
They're only the beginning.

3796
02:26:12,080 --> 02:26:13,520
I don't wanna become like them.

3797
02:26:14,520 --> 02:26:15,900
You are, well...

3798
02:26:15,900 --> 02:26:16,640
Lucky.

3799
02:26:16,860 --> 02:26:17,660
Wait, how so?

3800
02:26:18,080 --> 02:26:20,460
You see, at this early stage, the parasite, the Plaga.

3801
02:26:21,240 --> 02:26:23,040
It is possible to remove it.

3802
02:26:23,580 --> 02:26:25,200
With the surgical procedure.

3803
02:26:26,120 --> 02:26:27,880
And all you need is some know-how.

3804
02:26:28,140 --> 02:26:30,560
And oh yeah, the right equipment.

3805
02:26:31,200 --> 02:26:32,380
Wait, do you know how?

3806
02:26:34,440 --> 02:26:35,260
No worries.

3807
02:26:35,860 --> 02:26:37,900
See, I have a kitchen knife.

3808
02:26:38,960 --> 02:26:39,480
I have a kitchen knife.

3809
02:26:39,480 --> 02:26:40,540
But you're going to have to trust me.

3810
02:26:43,820 --> 02:26:45,080
I have a kitchen knife.

3811
02:26:45,180 --> 02:26:45,780
Would this help?

3812
02:26:46,540 --> 02:26:47,900
Great, we're partners then.

3813
02:26:48,520 --> 02:26:49,420
Hey, why are you...

3814
02:26:49,420 --> 02:26:50,940
Thank you.

3815
02:26:51,060 --> 02:26:52,460
Welcome to tomato farm.

3816
02:26:52,520 --> 02:26:53,180
Welcome, welcome.

3817
02:26:53,920 --> 02:26:55,200
Because it makes me feel better.

3818
02:26:55,480 --> 02:26:56,400
Let's leave it at that.

3819
02:26:57,380 --> 02:26:58,380
We'll contact you later.

3820
02:26:58,980 --> 02:26:59,560
Wait, what?

3821
02:26:59,720 --> 02:27:00,500
He's just gonna leave?

3822
02:27:02,820 --> 02:27:04,520
He's just gonna leave me like that?

3823
02:27:07,260 --> 02:27:09,660
Oh my god, we've made it to another chapter guys.

3824
02:27:09,800 --> 02:27:10,460
We're doing it.

3825
02:27:10,700 --> 02:27:11,840
We're fucking...

3826
02:27:11,840 --> 02:27:12,900
I'm gonna save it right here.

3827
02:27:13,040 --> 02:27:14,620
We're fucking doing it.

3828
02:27:14,660 --> 02:27:17,180
We actually made it to another chapter.

3829
02:27:18,180 --> 02:27:18,760
We actually made it to another chapter.

3830
02:27:21,460 --> 02:27:22,560
Goodbye, Lewis.

3831
02:27:23,500 --> 02:27:24,020
Goodbye.

3832
02:27:24,480 --> 02:27:24,840
Goodbye, Lewis.

3833
02:27:25,920 --> 02:27:27,180
Wait, we're gonna see more?

3834
02:27:27,980 --> 02:27:29,220
I saw him leave.

3835
02:27:31,440 --> 02:27:31,960
Hey.

3836
02:27:32,580 --> 02:27:33,060
Ada?

3837
02:27:34,280 --> 02:27:35,240
I do.

3838
02:27:35,580 --> 02:27:36,660
The kind you like.

3839
02:27:37,320 --> 02:27:38,440
Now where's the amber?

3840
02:27:40,100 --> 02:27:42,040
Fortunately, it's not on me at the moment.

3841
02:27:43,020 --> 02:27:45,100
And you really should be telling me.

3842
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:47,560
What a good job I did.

3843
02:27:48,320 --> 02:27:51,900
Busted my ass and managed to hide it right before I got caught.

3844
02:27:53,340 --> 02:27:53,840
Busted my ass and managed to hide it right before I got caught.

3845
02:27:53,840 --> 02:27:54,040
Which...

3846
02:27:54,040 --> 02:27:54,240
Which...

3847
02:27:54,840 --> 02:27:56,420
Is why I'm still alive.

3848
02:27:57,320 --> 02:27:59,620
I think she's just making him cry then.

3849
02:28:00,040 --> 02:28:02,320
I think she's just making him cry then.

3850
02:28:02,320 --> 02:28:02,580
I'm gonna go get the amber.

3851
02:28:03,020 --> 02:28:05,300
No amber, no protection, Lewis.

3852
02:28:07,820 --> 02:28:10,100
Such a stickler for details, huh, Ada?

3853
02:28:10,700 --> 02:28:11,220
Such a stickler for details, huh, Ada?

3854
02:28:11,960 --> 02:28:12,840
Okay then.

3855
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:15,120
I'll go get each now.

3856
02:28:15,220 --> 02:28:15,660
How about that?

3857
02:28:27,580 --> 02:28:30,220
And I do have something else I need to get too.

3858
02:28:32,420 --> 02:28:32,940
What?

3859
02:28:33,300 --> 02:28:34,260
What is it?

3860
02:28:35,880 --> 02:28:37,100
Can I not go back?

3861
02:28:37,320 --> 02:28:38,260
That sucks.

3862
02:28:38,540 --> 02:28:40,700
There was so much loot over there.

3863
02:28:41,060 --> 02:28:41,240
There was so much loot over there.

3864
02:28:42,520 --> 02:28:42,840
I don't like this.

3865
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:44,680
The chopper can't make its approach.

3866
02:28:44,900 --> 02:28:45,040
No!

3867
02:28:47,080 --> 02:28:47,520
Negative.

3868
02:28:47,720 --> 02:28:48,300
Too dangerous.

3869
02:28:49,040 --> 02:28:50,920
We're gonna get out of here and find someplace safe.

3870
02:28:51,540 --> 02:28:52,240
I'm sorry.

3871
02:28:52,480 --> 02:28:53,960
I wish I could do more to help.

3872
02:28:54,280 --> 02:28:56,040
Bro, you barely helped at all.

3873
02:28:56,320 --> 02:28:57,240
We could swim home if we have to.

3874
02:28:57,820 --> 02:28:58,840
Condor One, out.

3875
02:28:59,000 --> 02:28:59,960
We could take the boat.

3876
02:29:02,020 --> 02:29:03,520
We take the boat.

3877
02:29:04,220 --> 02:29:05,860
Look at all this loot!

3878
02:29:08,840 --> 02:29:09,280
No!

3879
02:29:10,380 --> 02:29:12,680
Look at all this loot!

3880
02:29:14,400 --> 02:29:16,860
It's just staring at me!

3881
02:29:17,640 --> 02:29:18,360
It's just staring at me!

3882
02:29:18,360 --> 02:29:18,400
It's just staring at me!

3883
02:29:18,400 --> 02:29:19,340
So fucked up.

3884
02:29:23,180 --> 02:29:24,960
What's gonna happen to me?

3885
02:29:25,640 --> 02:29:26,440
Right now.

3886
02:29:26,600 --> 02:29:27,480
Gone forever.

3887
02:29:28,020 --> 02:29:29,340
Let's just focus on getting out of here.

3888
02:29:33,810 --> 02:29:35,010
Goodbye loot.

3889
02:29:35,850 --> 02:29:36,450
Goodbye.

3890
02:29:36,730 --> 02:29:37,770
Oh my god.

3891
02:29:38,350 --> 02:29:40,870
But I do have all these kitchen knives.

3892
02:29:41,030 --> 02:29:42,390
Okay, I'm gonna make...

3893
02:29:42,390 --> 02:29:43,570
I'm gonna save this.

3894
02:29:43,850 --> 02:29:45,970
I need to use my kitchen knives.

3895
02:29:46,050 --> 02:29:46,810
Not gonna lie.

3896
02:29:47,930 --> 02:29:49,110
Do I have enough?

3897
02:29:49,210 --> 02:29:50,010
No, I need two more.

3898
02:29:50,250 --> 02:29:51,290
I need to save up.

3899
02:29:51,990 --> 02:29:52,910
See, look.

3900
02:29:53,050 --> 02:29:56,370
All those grenades were worth it in the end.

3901
02:29:56,870 --> 02:29:57,610
All those grenades were worth it in the end.

3902
02:29:57,610 --> 02:29:58,770
Guys, they were all worth it.

3903
02:29:59,230 --> 02:30:01,430
God, there is way too many kitchen knives.

3904
02:30:01,970 --> 02:30:04,670
What am I gonna do with all these kitchen knives, man?

3905
02:30:05,010 --> 02:30:08,270
What am I gonna do with all these kitchen knives, man?

3906
02:30:08,510 --> 02:30:11,010
My inventory is finally loaded.

3907
02:30:11,030 --> 02:30:11,690
I'm looking clean.

3908
02:30:11,850 --> 02:30:13,870
All that hoarding.

3909
02:30:13,890 --> 02:30:16,790
Gone from one fucking chapter.

3910
02:30:19,810 --> 02:30:21,290
What is this?

3911
02:30:21,350 --> 02:30:22,270
This is bullshit.

3912
02:30:23,530 --> 02:30:26,890
What's the point of having money if I can't buy ammo?

3913
02:30:28,750 --> 02:30:29,970
What's the point of having money if I can't buy ammo?

3914
02:30:29,970 --> 02:30:29,970
What's the point?

3915
02:30:29,970 --> 02:30:31,570
Why are you giving me more money?

3916
02:30:32,130 --> 02:30:32,790
What's the point?

3917
02:30:32,790 --> 02:30:32,790
Why are you giving me more money?

3918
02:30:32,790 --> 02:30:33,710
Give me ammo!

3919
02:30:35,030 --> 02:30:37,070
You ever seen those nasty guns?

3920
02:30:37,250 --> 02:30:39,250
Guys with the tentacles on their head?

3921
02:30:39,250 --> 02:30:42,090
Not only are they dangerous, but they are a pain to kill.

3922
02:30:42,250 --> 02:30:43,890
They do have a weakness though.

3923
02:30:44,010 --> 02:30:46,690
They absolutely hate bright lights like the sun.

3924
02:30:46,830 --> 02:30:47,210
They absolutely hate bright lights like the sun.

3925
02:30:47,210 --> 02:30:48,550
That's why you won't see them during...

3926
02:30:48,550 --> 02:30:49,110
Oh, thank you.

3927
02:30:49,230 --> 02:30:49,510
Wow.

3928
02:30:49,770 --> 02:30:50,390
Thank you.

3929
02:30:50,490 --> 02:30:50,830
Yeah.

3930
02:30:52,150 --> 02:30:52,590
Really?

3931
02:30:55,750 --> 02:30:56,970
The riot gun.

3932
02:30:57,150 --> 02:30:58,470
Oh shit, is this a better shotgun?

3933
02:31:00,190 --> 02:31:02,950
Wait, is this the better shotgun?

3934
02:31:06,130 --> 02:31:08,370
Okay, I'm gonna sell my old shotgun then.

3935
02:31:08,450 --> 02:31:08,590
Okay, I'm gonna sell my old shotgun then.

3936
02:31:08,590 --> 02:31:09,290
Which one?

3937
02:31:09,390 --> 02:31:10,550
I almost sold the rifle.

3938
02:31:11,050 --> 02:31:13,010
This is the bad one, right?

3939
02:31:13,870 --> 02:31:14,430
Yeah.

3940
02:31:14,450 --> 02:31:15,250
This is the...

3941
02:31:16,130 --> 02:31:18,370
Okay, I'm gonna sell the old shotgun.

3942
02:31:18,850 --> 02:31:20,210
I don't need you anymore.

3943
02:31:21,310 --> 02:31:22,270
Alright, bye.

3944
02:31:22,610 --> 02:31:23,590
Riot gun.

3945
02:31:24,530 --> 02:31:25,790
Okay, yeah.

3946
02:31:31,770 --> 02:31:33,770
I'm done playing with you.

3947
02:31:35,650 --> 02:31:36,710
Alright, here you go.

3948
02:31:37,050 --> 02:31:38,470
Uh, then we can...

3949
02:31:38,590 --> 02:31:39,730
Upgrade our good shotgun.

3950
02:31:39,970 --> 02:31:40,290
Okay.

3951
02:31:41,330 --> 02:31:41,790
Nice.

3952
02:31:41,910 --> 02:31:43,690
And then... power.

3953
02:31:44,130 --> 02:31:44,590
Nice.

3954
02:31:45,470 --> 02:31:46,390
That's all we need.

3955
02:31:46,430 --> 02:31:48,070
We just need a full power.

3956
02:31:49,010 --> 02:31:49,930
And then...

3957
02:31:50,460 --> 02:31:52,990
I don't really need anything else other than that.

3958
02:31:53,030 --> 02:31:53,470
Honestly.

3959
02:31:53,650 --> 02:31:55,230
Everything else is a waste of money.

3960
02:31:55,450 --> 02:31:55,710
Everything else is a waste of money.

3961
02:31:56,650 --> 02:31:57,110
Ooh!

3962
02:31:57,510 --> 02:31:58,130
The stock!

3963
02:31:58,310 --> 02:31:58,970
Wait, this is good!

3964
02:32:00,130 --> 02:32:01,470
Okay, we're gonna need...

3965
02:32:01,470 --> 02:32:02,950
We're gonna need this.

3966
02:32:04,110 --> 02:32:05,030
And then...

3967
02:32:05,030 --> 02:32:07,690
I'm gonna grab more gunpowder at this rate.

3968
02:32:08,630 --> 02:32:09,830
I'm fucking desperate.

3969
02:32:10,490 --> 02:32:12,070
I'm so desperate.

3970
02:32:14,590 --> 02:32:15,890
Okay, we're gonna put...

3971
02:32:17,150 --> 02:32:18,550
Uh... put this here.

3972
02:32:19,130 --> 02:32:19,930
And then here.

3973
02:32:20,050 --> 02:32:20,730
Alright, there we go.

3974
02:32:23,210 --> 02:32:23,670
Alright.

3975
02:32:25,530 --> 02:32:25,990
Good.

3976
02:32:26,190 --> 02:32:26,570
We're good.

3977
02:32:28,270 --> 02:32:28,730
Yes.

3978
02:32:31,010 --> 02:32:32,170
Alright, here we go.

3979
02:32:32,810 --> 02:32:33,910
Should be good now.

3980
02:32:34,030 --> 02:32:37,370
And then we can make more ammo for the fucking shotgun!

3981
02:32:37,550 --> 02:32:38,410
And then we can make more ammo for the fucking shotgun!

3982
02:32:38,590 --> 02:32:39,690
Okay, shotgun shells.

3983
02:32:40,390 --> 02:32:42,430
We always need ammo for a shotgun.

3984
02:32:43,790 --> 02:32:44,270
Alright.

3985
02:32:44,550 --> 02:32:45,830
We should be good now.

3986
02:32:46,850 --> 02:32:47,330
Boop!

3987
02:32:47,850 --> 02:32:49,210
Because they gave me rifle!

3988
02:32:49,450 --> 02:32:51,030
They always give me rifle ammo.

3989
02:32:51,030 --> 02:32:51,970
They know what I want.

3990
02:32:52,270 --> 02:32:53,190
Oh, there's boxes here.

3991
02:32:53,630 --> 02:32:56,930
Thank god it's... Thank god it's marked yellow.

3992
02:32:57,310 --> 02:32:58,150
I'm gonna save.

3993
02:32:58,230 --> 02:32:59,590
Because I don't want to do that again.

3994
02:33:02,430 --> 02:33:04,550
I don't want to do that again.

3995
02:33:04,590 --> 02:33:05,950
So I'm gonna save just in case.

3996
02:33:06,890 --> 02:33:07,370
So I'm gonna save just in case.

3997
02:33:07,370 --> 02:33:07,370
Alright.

3998
02:33:07,970 --> 02:33:08,570
That's true.

3999
02:33:08,590 --> 02:33:09,470
I should be good to go.

4000
02:33:09,970 --> 02:33:10,750
Here we go!

4001
02:33:12,610 --> 02:33:13,790
Uh... Oh, I missed out.

4002
02:33:13,850 --> 02:33:14,270
Wait, what?

4003
02:33:15,450 --> 02:33:17,450
How is there ammo that I missed out?

4004
02:33:17,490 --> 02:33:18,370
I smashed everything.

4005
02:33:19,490 --> 02:33:20,350
What the fuck?

4006
02:33:20,570 --> 02:33:22,050
Did I not press the F key?

4007
02:33:24,710 --> 02:33:27,130
Where the fuck is that one fucking resource?

4008
02:33:27,370 --> 02:33:27,990
Oh, it's here!

4009
02:33:28,770 --> 02:33:30,290
Oh, it's on the box!

4010
02:33:31,410 --> 02:33:32,070
Here we go.

4011
02:33:32,210 --> 02:33:32,650
Nice.

4012
02:33:36,030 --> 02:33:36,690
Here we go.

4013
02:33:38,590 --> 02:33:38,610
I'm gonna go to the elevator.

4014
02:33:43,360 --> 02:33:44,320
It's okay.

4015
02:33:45,420 --> 02:33:46,820
I am wil...

4016
02:33:46,820 --> 02:33:47,200
Oh.

4017
02:33:47,680 --> 02:33:48,400
Quietly?

4018
02:33:48,500 --> 02:33:49,140
Okay.

4019
02:33:49,720 --> 02:33:50,440
Wait.

4020
02:33:50,480 --> 02:33:51,000
Guys.

4021
02:33:51,960 --> 02:33:53,540
Does this wave end?

4022
02:33:58,720 --> 02:33:59,440
Yes?

4023
02:34:05,660 --> 02:34:06,380
Okay.

4024
02:34:10,100 --> 02:34:10,820
They...

4025
02:34:10,820 --> 02:34:11,360
Oh.

4026
02:34:11,400 --> 02:34:11,660
Alright.

4027
02:34:12,560 --> 02:34:14,480
We're not doing it quietly.

4028
02:34:19,180 --> 02:34:20,640
Yes, but don't do it.

4029
02:34:20,700 --> 02:34:20,940
What?

4030
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:21,960
What do you mean?

4031
02:34:23,340 --> 02:34:24,260
Why not?

4032
02:34:27,360 --> 02:34:28,500
But like...

4033
02:34:28,500 --> 02:34:30,880
But I can just kill everybody.

4034
02:34:34,100 --> 02:34:35,520
It's more fun.

4035
02:34:36,720 --> 02:34:40,400
Yes, but there is a lot.

4036
02:34:40,560 --> 02:34:42,300
There can't be that many.

4037
02:34:44,100 --> 02:34:44,940
Like...

4038
02:34:44,940 --> 02:34:46,980
There is always an end.

4039
02:34:47,100 --> 02:34:47,740
Guys.

4040
02:34:47,840 --> 02:34:49,540
There's no way.

4041
02:34:53,530 --> 02:34:55,570
There's no way.

4042
02:34:55,710 --> 02:34:56,450
Guys.

4043
02:34:56,750 --> 02:34:59,170
There's always an end.

4044
02:35:01,430 --> 02:35:02,950
Oh, is he turning?

4045
02:35:04,690 --> 02:35:07,650
Bro, why is he turning in the middle of this?

4046
02:35:08,190 --> 02:35:09,310
That's not fair.

4047
02:35:10,550 --> 02:35:11,830
Actually, you're like...

4048
02:35:13,310 --> 02:35:15,970
You're like being seen by everything.

4049
02:35:16,530 --> 02:35:17,570
Bro, I...

4050
02:35:18,770 --> 02:35:20,730
Oh, he got on the bear trap.

4051
02:35:20,870 --> 02:35:21,650
There's traps here?

4052
02:35:21,790 --> 02:35:22,050
Fuck.

4053
02:35:22,110 --> 02:35:22,430
Okay.

4054
02:35:22,430 --> 02:35:25,090
I was not expecting the traps.

4055
02:35:33,090 --> 02:35:33,650
What?

4056
02:35:33,930 --> 02:35:34,490
How?

4057
02:35:35,150 --> 02:35:36,270
Oh, fuck.

4058
02:35:36,410 --> 02:35:36,830
Okay.

4059
02:35:36,890 --> 02:35:36,990
I'm not gonna die.

4060
02:35:36,990 --> 02:35:37,110
Okay.

4061
02:35:37,110 --> 02:35:37,230
We...

4062
02:35:37,230 --> 02:35:37,830
Okay.

4063
02:35:40,190 --> 02:35:43,370
Guys, this is bad.

4064
02:35:44,710 --> 02:35:46,050
Guys, it's okay.

4065
02:35:47,970 --> 02:35:49,250
I have one more.

4066
02:35:54,500 --> 02:35:55,020
No.

4067
02:35:55,020 --> 02:35:55,900
No warning.

4068
02:35:56,840 --> 02:35:57,880
No warning.

4069
02:36:01,200 --> 02:36:04,280
Actually, I don't know.

4070
02:36:04,300 --> 02:36:04,880
You know this.

4071
02:36:05,180 --> 02:36:06,920
But there's never a warning.

4072
02:36:10,280 --> 02:36:11,560
But we have the stock.

4073
02:36:14,040 --> 02:36:14,520
Okay.

4074
02:36:14,580 --> 02:36:14,900
Look.

4075
02:36:15,020 --> 02:36:15,740
It was worth it.

4076
02:36:18,180 --> 02:36:19,480
Guys, it was worth it.

4077
02:36:20,860 --> 02:36:21,340
Wait.

4078
02:36:21,360 --> 02:36:21,940
There's more?

4079
02:36:22,360 --> 02:36:24,100
Oh, it's because of the fine lady.

4080
02:36:26,380 --> 02:36:26,860
Alright.

4081
02:36:26,920 --> 02:36:27,220
Nice.

4082
02:36:27,380 --> 02:36:27,800
We're fine.

4083
02:36:29,440 --> 02:36:30,780
She has to look up, right?

4084
02:36:30,940 --> 02:36:31,660
There you go.

4085
02:36:32,720 --> 02:36:33,200
See?

4086
02:36:33,440 --> 02:36:34,720
Everything is fine.

4087
02:36:35,760 --> 02:36:37,620
We got our ammo back.

4088
02:36:38,120 --> 02:36:38,600
Stealth?

4089
02:36:38,640 --> 02:36:40,260
I told you we don't need it.

4090
02:36:40,280 --> 02:36:40,720
Stealth?

4091
02:36:41,240 --> 02:36:41,900
Boom!

4092
02:36:42,040 --> 02:36:44,720
That one grenade saved our fucking lives.

4093
02:36:46,040 --> 02:36:47,060
There you go.

4094
02:36:48,020 --> 02:36:50,460
Thank God for that one grenade that I have.

4095
02:36:50,740 --> 02:36:51,620
I'm gonna...

4096
02:36:52,050 --> 02:36:53,420
I'm gonna go back and save.

4097
02:37:00,220 --> 02:37:01,200
We're gonna...

4098
02:37:01,200 --> 02:37:04,570
We're gonna go back and save.

4099
02:37:07,840 --> 02:37:09,160
We... We're...

4100
02:37:10,280 --> 02:37:11,260
We're gonna do that again.

4101
02:37:12,320 --> 02:37:12,920
Welcome.

4102
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:14,860
What can I...

4103
02:37:14,860 --> 02:37:18,400
But like, guys, I don't wanna do that again though.

4104
02:37:18,480 --> 02:37:19,300
That's the thing.

4105
02:37:19,780 --> 02:37:21,580
What a pleasant travel.

4106
02:37:23,480 --> 02:37:25,660
What if Ashley just dies?

4107
02:37:25,860 --> 02:37:26,540
What if Ashley just dies?

4108
02:37:26,540 --> 02:37:27,940
Also, Gator, thank you for the super chat.

4109
02:37:28,060 --> 02:37:28,360
Thank you.

4110
02:37:28,380 --> 02:37:28,960
Thank you.

4111
02:37:29,040 --> 02:37:31,040
Guys, I can't trust Ashley.

4112
02:37:32,260 --> 02:37:33,920
What if she dies?

4113
02:37:34,400 --> 02:37:35,000
Chat.

4114
02:37:35,960 --> 02:37:39,020
You're gonna be responsible if she just dies.

4115
02:37:39,020 --> 02:37:40,720
And I have to do all of that again.

4116
02:37:40,760 --> 02:37:41,740
Oh, I forgot to repair the knife.

4117
02:37:41,860 --> 02:37:42,500
Sorry, we're going back.

4118
02:37:44,460 --> 02:37:45,160
Sorry, Ashley.

4119
02:37:45,200 --> 02:37:45,680
We're going back.

4120
02:37:47,420 --> 02:37:48,500
What if she doesn't?

4121
02:37:48,520 --> 02:37:50,300
Well, that's not the risk I'm gonna take!

4122
02:37:50,740 --> 02:37:52,400
It's not even 50-50!

4123
02:37:52,980 --> 02:37:55,860
There's more of a chance that she's just gonna fucking die!

4124
02:37:56,720 --> 02:37:57,720
There's more of a chance that she's just gonna fucking die!

4125
02:37:57,720 --> 02:37:57,960
Okay.

4126
02:37:59,200 --> 02:37:59,600
Alright.

4127
02:37:59,900 --> 02:38:00,300
Nice.

4128
02:38:02,020 --> 02:38:02,860
It's so weak.

4129
02:38:03,020 --> 02:38:04,280
It's the president's daughter.

4130
02:38:04,860 --> 02:38:06,580
It doesn't matter how weak she is.

4131
02:38:07,180 --> 02:38:08,600
She's the president's daughter.

4132
02:38:12,020 --> 02:38:13,880
Okay, I cannot protect stupid.

4133
02:38:15,980 --> 02:38:18,840
I can delay it, but I can't protect it.

4134
02:38:25,480 --> 02:38:26,620
What the fuck?

4135
02:38:26,680 --> 02:38:27,540
Does Ashley burn?

4136
02:38:27,760 --> 02:38:28,500
She doesn't burn.

4137
02:38:28,580 --> 02:38:29,200
Oh, thank god.

4138
02:38:29,280 --> 02:38:29,560
Okay.

4139
02:38:30,420 --> 02:38:31,500
She doesn't burn.

4140
02:38:31,640 --> 02:38:32,200
That's like...

4141
02:38:32,760 --> 02:38:33,220
That's fine.

4142
02:38:36,980 --> 02:38:37,760
Alright, nice.

4143
02:38:38,480 --> 02:38:39,380
Did she turn?

4144
02:38:39,600 --> 02:38:41,340
Well, if she turns, she can't fucking...

4145
02:38:42,380 --> 02:38:42,900
do the thing.

4146
02:38:43,580 --> 02:38:44,680
Oh, she is turning.

4147
02:38:44,900 --> 02:38:46,380
Are you serious?!

4148
02:38:49,020 --> 02:38:49,900
I didn't...

4149
02:38:50,400 --> 02:38:52,000
Like, what is she gonna do?

4150
02:38:52,260 --> 02:38:53,500
Is she gonna drop down?

4151
02:38:54,660 --> 02:38:56,040
Yeah, she can't do anything!

4152
02:38:57,120 --> 02:38:58,680
Okay, but she's annoying me.

4153
02:38:58,780 --> 02:38:59,500
So I'm just gonna kill her.

4154
02:39:00,140 --> 02:39:04,580
She is annoying, though.

4155
02:39:05,520 --> 02:39:06,180
There you go.

4156
02:39:09,580 --> 02:39:10,020
Nice.

4157
02:39:10,020 --> 02:39:11,700
God, more money that I don't need.

4158
02:39:12,160 --> 02:39:14,540
I need fucking loot, not money.

4159
02:39:15,780 --> 02:39:16,520
Thank you.

4160
02:39:16,860 --> 02:39:17,780
That's what I need.

4161
02:39:19,160 --> 02:39:19,640
Alright.

4162
02:39:19,740 --> 02:39:21,220
I thought you guys said like...

4163
02:39:21,220 --> 02:39:23,780
It's better if it's like stealth.

4164
02:39:24,500 --> 02:39:26,940
That was like not even that many people.

4165
02:39:30,470 --> 02:39:31,750
I think maybe it's the...

4166
02:39:31,750 --> 02:39:33,390
This is where I should stealth.

4167
02:39:36,800 --> 02:39:38,000
If there's people here.

4168
02:39:38,680 --> 02:39:39,380
Actually, no.

4169
02:39:39,480 --> 02:39:40,400
I don't need to stealth this.

4170
02:39:40,400 --> 02:39:42,540
Wait, am I missing loot behind me?

4171
02:39:42,720 --> 02:39:43,460
I'm not.

4172
02:39:43,680 --> 02:39:44,380
Oh, wait.

4173
02:39:44,420 --> 02:39:44,680
I am.

4174
02:39:46,640 --> 02:39:48,040
Wait a minute.

4175
02:39:51,280 --> 02:39:52,540
Wait a minute.

4176
02:39:53,620 --> 02:39:55,320
I am missing loot.

4177
02:39:55,780 --> 02:39:56,740
Sorry, Ashley.

4178
02:39:56,820 --> 02:39:57,680
This is important.

4179
02:40:05,180 --> 02:40:07,280
Why did I come back here?

4180
02:40:07,560 --> 02:40:09,900
Why did I come back here?

4181
02:40:10,360 --> 02:40:12,720
Why the fuck did I come back?

4182
02:40:17,260 --> 02:40:18,020
Oh, hey.

4183
02:40:18,020 --> 02:40:18,020
Nice.

4184
02:40:18,160 --> 02:40:19,400
We needed that.

4185
02:40:19,560 --> 02:40:21,060
We needed a circular thing.

4186
02:40:22,100 --> 02:40:22,860
Okay.

4187
02:40:23,180 --> 02:40:24,480
Up we go.

4188
02:40:26,080 --> 02:40:26,460
Boop.

4189
02:40:27,140 --> 02:40:27,900
Nice.

4190
02:40:28,080 --> 02:40:29,000
Rifle ammo.

4191
02:40:29,340 --> 02:40:29,940
Nice.

4192
02:40:29,980 --> 02:40:32,400
Are you fucking...

4193
02:40:34,500 --> 02:40:35,260
Okay.

4194
02:40:38,960 --> 02:40:39,960
That's fine.

4195
02:40:39,960 --> 02:40:41,220
That's fine.

4196
02:40:41,420 --> 02:40:42,180
That's fine.

4197
02:40:42,180 --> 02:40:44,000
Where are all these bear traps coming from?

4198
02:40:44,140 --> 02:40:47,060
Where are they all coming from?!

4199
02:40:47,840 --> 02:40:49,080
Okay, we're okay.

4200
02:40:49,340 --> 02:40:49,880
We're okay.

4201
02:40:50,240 --> 02:40:51,260
We're okay.

4202
02:40:51,980 --> 02:40:53,440
It just keeps happening.

4203
02:40:58,790 --> 02:40:59,390
Period.

4204
02:40:59,390 --> 02:41:00,150
We're fine.

4205
02:41:03,610 --> 02:41:04,390
We're fine.

4206
02:41:05,390 --> 02:41:06,590
Everything is fine.

4207
02:41:06,810 --> 02:41:08,690
Okay, there is loot here.

4208
02:41:11,250 --> 02:41:12,430
How do I get up here?

4209
02:41:12,470 --> 02:41:13,050
Oh, there it is.

4210
02:41:15,110 --> 02:41:16,350
What the fuck?

4211
02:41:18,150 --> 02:41:18,850
Bro, okay.

4212
02:41:18,930 --> 02:41:20,230
Don't announce your...

4213
02:41:24,790 --> 02:41:25,670
Oh shit!

4214
02:41:28,570 --> 02:41:29,310
There we go.

4215
02:41:29,770 --> 02:41:30,650
Alright, that's fine.

4216
02:41:32,110 --> 02:41:32,930
That is fine.

4217
02:41:32,990 --> 02:41:34,030
Do I have another egg?

4218
02:41:34,070 --> 02:41:35,530
I do not have another egg.

4219
02:41:35,850 --> 02:41:37,890
Okay, we need a yellow herb.

4220
02:41:38,110 --> 02:41:39,310
We are... okay.

4221
02:41:40,250 --> 02:41:42,070
I think this... it'll be fine.

4222
02:41:42,290 --> 02:41:43,770
I can take this.

4223
02:41:43,870 --> 02:41:45,430
We don't need to worry.

4224
02:41:46,030 --> 02:41:47,870
We'll find... we'll find...

4225
02:41:47,870 --> 02:41:50,270
a yellow herb sooner or later.

4226
02:41:50,610 --> 02:41:51,870
That's the risk I'm willing...

4227
02:41:51,870 --> 02:41:52,870
Okay, maybe not.

4228
02:41:52,990 --> 02:41:56,630
The way you're looking at me, Ashley, I don't know if that is the risk I'm willing to take.

4229
02:41:57,990 --> 02:42:00,670
I have so many sprays.

4230
02:42:02,030 --> 02:42:04,030
I have so many sprays.

4231
02:42:04,030 --> 02:42:04,590
This is fine.

4232
02:42:05,110 --> 02:42:06,170
This is fine.

4233
02:42:07,490 --> 02:42:09,950
I realize that should not be a risk.

4234
02:42:10,250 --> 02:42:10,570
I should take.

4235
02:42:12,230 --> 02:42:13,710
Like, thinking about it.

4236
02:42:13,730 --> 02:42:14,870
That's not a great idea.

4237
02:42:16,790 --> 02:42:19,770
Bro, I haven't even fought like Adam Sandler yet.

4238
02:42:21,670 --> 02:42:22,830
Where did I go?

4239
02:42:23,530 --> 02:42:24,550
Oh, it's this way.

4240
02:42:29,700 --> 02:42:34,460
Like, I haven't fought Adam Sandler and I don't know if I'll have the resources for this now.

4241
02:42:36,260 --> 02:42:37,540
Because I'm fighting everybody.

4242
02:42:38,960 --> 02:42:40,380
Yeah, I don't like that.

4243
02:42:40,640 --> 02:42:41,560
It sure is.

4244
02:42:41,880 --> 02:42:42,940
Why did you have to...

4245
02:42:42,960 --> 02:42:43,560
say that, Leon?

4246
02:42:44,540 --> 02:42:45,140
Why?

4247
02:42:45,680 --> 02:42:47,220
Never say it's quiet.

4248
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:49,540
It's never a good sign.

4249
02:42:55,410 --> 02:42:56,010
Okay.

4250
02:42:56,190 --> 02:42:57,330
We gotta go this way.

4251
02:42:59,170 --> 02:43:00,870
Welcome, welcome to the tomato farm!

4252
02:43:01,050 --> 02:43:01,710
Welcome, welcome!

4253
02:43:02,910 --> 02:43:03,510
Oh!

4254
02:43:05,650 --> 02:43:06,250
Okay.

4255
02:43:06,410 --> 02:43:07,890
We can stealth this.

4256
02:43:09,590 --> 02:43:10,190
Right?

4257
02:43:10,870 --> 02:43:13,530
Maybe I'll, like, stab one correctly.

4258
02:43:17,030 --> 02:43:18,070
Does he see me?

4259
02:43:20,770 --> 02:43:21,970
Does he see me?

4260
02:43:23,910 --> 02:43:24,390
Oh!

4261
02:43:26,190 --> 02:43:29,910
Guys, I thought he didn't see me!

4262
02:43:30,090 --> 02:43:31,790
How was I supposed to know?

4263
02:43:36,050 --> 02:43:36,950
I don't know!

4264
02:43:38,270 --> 02:43:39,430
There was a...

4265
02:43:40,090 --> 02:43:41,650
He could have not seen me.

4266
02:43:41,810 --> 02:43:43,230
There could have been a possibility.

4267
02:43:43,970 --> 02:43:44,890
Out of the way!

4268
02:43:50,290 --> 02:43:51,830
It could have been possible.

4269
02:43:52,250 --> 02:43:53,950
I just wanted to... No!

4270
02:43:54,870 --> 02:43:57,050
I just wanted to test out my theory.

4271
02:43:58,390 --> 02:43:59,590
I mean...

4272
02:43:59,590 --> 02:44:00,510
Yellow herb!

4273
02:44:00,670 --> 02:44:01,550
I should have risked it.

4274
02:44:01,650 --> 02:44:02,890
I should have fucking risked it.

4275
02:44:03,550 --> 02:44:06,150
I should have risked it, man.

4276
02:44:06,770 --> 02:44:09,730
All I'm saying is that MatPat graduated.

4277
02:44:10,110 --> 02:44:12,950
So, like, we need somebody to test theories out.

4278
02:44:13,210 --> 02:44:16,810
And I was gonna take that risk.

4279
02:44:18,490 --> 02:44:21,590
Who else would have done it if it wasn't for me?

4280
02:44:24,430 --> 02:44:25,570
Who else?

4281
02:44:27,210 --> 02:44:27,930
Okay.

4282
02:44:27,950 --> 02:44:28,530
Nice.

4283
02:44:29,350 --> 02:44:30,550
So true.

4284
02:44:33,610 --> 02:44:34,330
Alright.

4285
02:44:34,530 --> 02:44:34,890
Oof!

4286
02:44:36,170 --> 02:44:36,890
Nice.

4287
02:44:37,150 --> 02:44:37,810
Money!

4288
02:44:42,590 --> 02:44:43,310
Order?

4289
02:44:43,430 --> 02:44:44,370
Stay inside!

4290
02:44:44,790 --> 02:44:46,350
Go into this locker!

4291
02:44:46,670 --> 02:44:46,890
Okay.

4292
02:44:48,610 --> 02:44:49,530
Oh my god!

4293
02:44:49,570 --> 02:44:50,110
This is great!

4294
02:44:50,230 --> 02:44:52,070
I don't have to give a shit about you anymore.

4295
02:44:53,110 --> 02:44:53,550
Alright.

4296
02:44:53,550 --> 02:44:54,390
Oh my god!

4297
02:44:54,410 --> 02:44:54,910
Thank you!

4298
02:44:55,490 --> 02:44:56,150
Thank you!

4299
02:44:56,150 --> 02:44:58,450
You've given me the one thing I could ever ask for.

4300
02:44:59,090 --> 02:44:59,870
No, Ashley.

4301
02:45:04,450 --> 02:45:06,030
Just live in there for now.

4302
02:45:06,230 --> 02:45:08,350
I'll be back after I finish the game, Ashley.

4303
02:45:12,350 --> 02:45:12,870
Don't worry.

4304
02:45:13,110 --> 02:45:14,470
I'll come back for you.

4305
02:45:15,150 --> 02:45:16,030
I promise.

4306
02:45:16,950 --> 02:45:17,390
Haha.

4307
02:45:18,610 --> 02:45:20,070
I definitely promise.

4308
02:45:22,950 --> 02:45:24,170
I just leave her there?

4309
02:45:24,530 --> 02:45:26,310
Like, does it really matter?

4310
02:45:27,750 --> 02:45:28,150
Guys!

4311
02:45:32,990 --> 02:45:33,390
What?

4312
02:45:33,810 --> 02:45:34,750
She opened the lock?

4313
02:45:34,750 --> 02:45:35,390
Did you open the lock?

4314
02:45:35,430 --> 02:45:36,070
Oh no, that's the door.

4315
02:45:36,150 --> 02:45:40,170
I was gonna say, Ashley, what did I tell you about not opening that locker?

4316
02:45:45,270 --> 02:45:46,250
No, of course not.

4317
02:45:46,310 --> 02:45:47,310
I would never leave her.

4318
02:45:49,110 --> 02:45:49,510
Okay.

4319
02:45:49,810 --> 02:45:51,450
I need to...

4320
02:45:51,450 --> 02:45:52,190
Just leave me alone.

4321
02:45:52,190 --> 02:45:53,490
I'm just making sure I got all the loot.

4322
02:45:55,830 --> 02:45:58,210
There's suspiciously a lot of loot.

4323
02:45:59,010 --> 02:46:00,290
I feel like...

4324
02:46:00,290 --> 02:46:02,130
Is this gonna be another boss fight?

4325
02:46:02,410 --> 02:46:04,870
I feel like I have to run around and shoot people.

4326
02:46:05,530 --> 02:46:06,470
I don't know.

4327
02:46:06,630 --> 02:46:07,250
This is...

4328
02:46:07,250 --> 02:46:11,450
Yeah, this is definitely a run around shooting people.

4329
02:46:12,170 --> 02:46:16,390
There is way too many fucking ammo around me.

4330
02:46:17,090 --> 02:46:19,530
This is way too suspicious.

4331
02:46:19,530 --> 02:46:21,690
Why is there so much ammo?

4332
02:46:22,750 --> 02:46:24,710
How do I get to that area?

4333
02:46:24,930 --> 02:46:25,430
To here?

4334
02:46:26,090 --> 02:46:27,010
There it is.

4335
02:46:27,310 --> 02:46:28,190
There it is.

4336
02:46:29,690 --> 02:46:31,270
It's an arena of some kind.

4337
02:46:31,450 --> 02:46:31,630
Yeah.

4338
02:46:32,250 --> 02:46:34,610
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

4339
02:46:35,070 --> 02:46:36,310
Be right back, guys.

4340
02:46:37,290 --> 02:46:39,770
There's no way anybody's gonna attack me.

4341
02:46:39,850 --> 02:46:40,410
I'm gonna...

4342
02:46:40,410 --> 02:46:41,890
I cannot risk it.

4343
02:46:43,450 --> 02:46:47,310
The game might be like, Why is she standing there for so long?

4344
02:46:47,750 --> 02:46:51,130
What if we like fucking throw some monsters at her?

4345
02:46:51,290 --> 02:46:52,330
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

4346
02:46:52,390 --> 02:46:52,770
Be right back.

4347
02:48:12,740 --> 02:48:13,360
Alright, guys.

4348
02:48:13,440 --> 02:48:14,080
I'm back.

4349
02:48:14,340 --> 02:48:16,320
Ellen and Luca, thank you for the super chat.

4350
02:48:16,420 --> 02:48:16,660
Thank you.

4351
02:48:16,680 --> 02:48:17,240
Thank you.

4352
02:48:17,540 --> 02:48:18,280
Okay, I'm back.

4353
02:48:18,760 --> 02:48:19,800
Alright, here we go.

4354
02:48:20,780 --> 02:48:22,200
Time to fight something.

4355
02:48:22,880 --> 02:48:23,800
Wait, this is not it.

4356
02:48:24,580 --> 02:48:25,940
Sorry, I already ran the wrong way.

4357
02:48:26,060 --> 02:48:26,580
Where am I?

4358
02:48:27,140 --> 02:48:27,820
Oh, this way.

4359
02:48:27,940 --> 02:48:28,240
Okay.

4360
02:48:29,280 --> 02:48:29,640
Time...

4361
02:48:29,640 --> 02:48:30,300
Am I going the right way?

4362
02:48:30,600 --> 02:48:30,960
Wait.

4363
02:48:31,680 --> 02:48:32,280
Where am I?

4364
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:35,000
Time to fight something.

4365
02:48:36,800 --> 02:48:37,480
Here we go.

4366
02:48:37,800 --> 02:48:38,560
Alright.

4367
02:48:39,680 --> 02:48:40,140
Oh.

4368
02:48:40,620 --> 02:48:41,780
That's awkward.

4369
02:48:42,740 --> 02:48:43,660
Wait.

4370
02:48:43,720 --> 02:48:44,640
That is a little awkward.

4371
02:48:44,900 --> 02:48:49,020
Who is that?

4372
02:48:49,520 --> 02:48:50,940
Wait a minute.

4373
02:48:51,800 --> 02:48:52,720
How?

4374
02:48:53,480 --> 02:48:53,940
Where?

4375
02:48:55,580 --> 02:48:57,200
Is Lu here?

4376
02:49:00,800 --> 02:49:01,720
Um...

4377
02:49:03,340 --> 02:49:04,260
Um...

4378
02:49:07,800 --> 02:49:08,740
Oh no.

4379
02:49:09,980 --> 02:49:11,640
Okay, we'll figure this out.

4380
02:49:13,220 --> 02:49:14,440
Get in the warehouse.

4381
02:49:14,640 --> 02:49:15,420
There's a warehouse?

4382
02:49:17,060 --> 02:49:17,580
This?

4383
02:49:18,320 --> 02:49:19,480
Is that a house?

4384
02:49:20,200 --> 02:49:21,080
There's no doors.

4385
02:49:22,140 --> 02:49:22,920
Oh no.

4386
02:49:23,020 --> 02:49:24,160
How am I already lost?

4387
02:49:24,920 --> 02:49:25,440
Okay.

4388
02:49:25,540 --> 02:49:25,820
Oh!

4389
02:49:25,980 --> 02:49:26,660
It's here.

4390
02:49:26,800 --> 02:49:27,460
Okay, here we go.

4391
02:49:28,240 --> 02:49:28,760
Okay.

4392
02:49:29,180 --> 02:49:30,500
Where are my yellow paint?

4393
02:49:35,640 --> 02:49:36,960
Where's the yellow paint?

4394
02:49:37,100 --> 02:49:38,640
How am I supposed to know anything?

4395
02:49:41,600 --> 02:49:42,680
Oh, here!

4396
02:49:43,780 --> 02:49:45,160
Oh my god!

4397
02:49:45,200 --> 02:49:47,940
There was a door here this entire time?

4398
02:49:51,500 --> 02:49:52,700
Can't believe it.

4399
02:49:52,740 --> 02:49:54,760
There was a door here this entire time.

4400
02:49:55,580 --> 02:49:57,260
Wait, there's the first aid spray.

4401
02:49:57,420 --> 02:49:59,020
It's like I never lost it.

4402
02:50:00,180 --> 02:50:02,100
I definitely did not notice that.

4403
02:50:03,220 --> 02:50:04,060
Let's see.

4404
02:50:06,860 --> 02:50:08,140
Oh, there's the cra- Oh!

4405
02:50:08,580 --> 02:50:09,140
Chainsaw!

4406
02:50:09,520 --> 02:50:10,500
Oh shit!

4407
02:50:11,640 --> 02:50:12,760
Does she die?

4408
02:50:15,800 --> 02:50:16,920
Oh fuck!

4409
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:18,900
Two chainsaw women?

4410
02:50:19,400 --> 02:50:21,660
Why did mom let you have two?

4411
02:50:22,800 --> 02:50:23,360
Why did mom let you have two?

4412
02:50:23,360 --> 02:50:23,360
Sorry.

4413
02:50:23,500 --> 02:50:24,620
I didn't realize it was yours.

4414
02:50:25,920 --> 02:50:27,300
I am flattered.

4415
02:50:27,500 --> 02:50:28,960
What the fuck?

4416
02:50:28,960 --> 02:50:29,340
What the fuck?

4417
02:50:32,040 --> 02:50:34,040
Why did mom let you have two?

4418
02:50:34,060 --> 02:50:35,560
Oh god.

4419
02:50:35,680 --> 02:50:36,300
Oh god.

4420
02:50:36,500 --> 02:50:38,120
What the fuck?

4421
02:50:42,440 --> 02:50:43,380
Oh god.

4422
02:50:43,420 --> 02:50:44,120
Oh god.

4423
02:50:44,220 --> 02:50:44,940
Oh god.

4424
02:50:45,080 --> 02:50:45,600
Oh!

4425
02:50:45,620 --> 02:50:46,600
What the fuck?

4426
02:50:46,620 --> 02:50:46,880
I knew it!

4427
02:50:46,940 --> 02:50:48,600
Oh, thank you for opening that door!

4428
02:50:48,980 --> 02:50:50,940
Now I know why Ashley is gone!

4429
02:50:55,780 --> 02:50:56,820
Jesus Christ.

4430
02:50:56,900 --> 02:50:57,140
Okay.

4431
02:51:01,460 --> 02:51:03,440
Wait, I hear people behind me.

4432
02:51:03,680 --> 02:51:04,600
That's not good.

4433
02:51:04,600 --> 02:51:07,780
I don't like it when I hear people behind me.

4434
02:51:09,540 --> 02:51:10,580
Oh god.

4435
02:51:10,740 --> 02:51:11,800
Oh god.

4436
02:51:12,320 --> 02:51:15,120
Oh, I don't like it when there's two chainsaw women!

4437
02:51:16,820 --> 02:51:17,960
It's not hot!

4438
02:51:22,940 --> 02:51:23,620
Hahaha!

4439
02:51:25,120 --> 02:51:27,200
Sometimes two is too many!

4440
02:51:27,900 --> 02:51:29,320
It's just, what do you do?

4441
02:51:29,760 --> 02:51:30,420
Hahaha!

4442
02:51:32,080 --> 02:51:32,760
Hahaha!

4443
02:51:34,440 --> 02:51:36,700
There's too much going on!

4444
02:51:38,580 --> 02:51:39,140
Hahaha!

4445
02:51:39,820 --> 02:51:39,940
Hahaha!

4446
02:51:41,460 --> 02:51:43,500
There's just too much going on!

4447
02:51:44,900 --> 02:51:46,340
It's just too overwhelming!

4448
02:51:48,620 --> 02:51:49,660
Where are they?

4449
02:51:51,140 --> 02:51:52,860
Where did chainsaw women go?

4450
02:51:53,100 --> 02:51:54,500
Bro, what the fuck man?

4451
02:51:55,160 --> 02:51:56,200
What the fuck?

4452
02:51:56,220 --> 02:51:57,520
I can just keep going backwards.

4453
02:51:57,940 --> 02:51:58,500
Like!

4454
02:52:01,980 --> 02:52:05,080
Alright, we're just gonna um...

4455
02:52:05,800 --> 02:52:08,380
Me feed... I know my back is clear.

4456
02:52:08,600 --> 02:52:10,320
That's what I...

4457
02:52:10,320 --> 02:52:11,740
That's what I...

4458
02:52:11,740 --> 02:52:13,600
Do I have nades?

4459
02:52:13,820 --> 02:52:14,460
Oh, I did!

4460
02:52:14,640 --> 02:52:16,960
Bro, I didn't even know I had nades!

4461
02:52:17,800 --> 02:52:18,540
Wait, what?

4462
02:52:18,780 --> 02:52:19,340
Are they...

4463
02:52:19,690 --> 02:52:20,780
Did they just walk away?

4464
02:52:23,660 --> 02:52:24,620
Where are they?

4465
02:52:25,480 --> 02:52:26,720
They just walked away.

4466
02:52:27,120 --> 02:52:27,620
Hahaha!

4467
02:52:32,690 --> 02:52:33,190
Hello?

4468
02:52:34,610 --> 02:52:35,110
Hahaha!

4469
02:52:38,700 --> 02:52:39,680
Where did they go?

4470
02:52:42,540 --> 02:52:42,740
What?

4471
02:52:42,780 --> 02:52:43,520
They gave up?

4472
02:52:44,440 --> 02:52:45,340
Oh, thank god!

4473
02:52:46,020 --> 02:52:46,460
Hahaha!

4474
02:52:48,960 --> 02:52:50,260
Like, where did they go?

4475
02:52:50,780 --> 02:52:51,220
Haha!

4476
02:52:51,320 --> 02:52:52,720
Like, they all just disappeared!

4477
02:52:56,680 --> 02:52:59,820
Alright, let's just get rid of him.

4478
02:52:59,960 --> 02:53:00,700
Do they drop anything?

4479
02:53:01,140 --> 02:53:02,340
Oh, thank god they do!

4480
02:53:02,800 --> 02:53:04,220
Okay, it's worth killing them.

4481
02:53:05,840 --> 02:53:07,180
Okay, it's worth killing them.

4482
02:53:07,240 --> 02:53:10,720
I just need to know where chainsaw women... where the chainsaw women go.

4483
02:53:11,020 --> 02:53:12,220
Where are they?

4484
02:53:12,440 --> 02:53:12,640
Oh!

4485
02:53:13,200 --> 02:53:14,220
Don't break down!

4486
02:53:15,260 --> 02:53:15,760
Hahaha!

4487
02:53:18,840 --> 02:53:19,360
Hahaha!

4488
02:53:21,340 --> 02:53:22,380
Holy shit!

4489
02:53:23,480 --> 02:53:25,300
Ask and ye shall receive!

4490
02:53:28,320 --> 02:53:29,300
Alright, there we go.

4491
02:53:29,460 --> 02:53:30,320
Whoa, shit!

4492
02:53:30,400 --> 02:53:30,700
Okay.

4493
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:34,780
Okay, nice.

4494
02:53:35,800 --> 02:53:36,320
Melee!

4495
02:53:36,420 --> 02:53:36,660
Melee!

4496
02:53:36,800 --> 02:53:37,080
Melee!

4497
02:53:38,940 --> 02:53:39,900
Oh my god.

4498
02:53:39,960 --> 02:53:40,680
He's still alive.

4499
02:53:41,300 --> 02:53:42,140
There you go.

4500
02:53:43,060 --> 02:53:45,040
Yeah, but I got chainsaw women!

4501
02:53:48,040 --> 02:53:49,640
Do they actually keep coming?

4502
02:53:51,200 --> 02:53:51,760
Wait.

4503
02:53:51,900 --> 02:53:52,980
Do they actually?

4504
02:53:53,400 --> 02:53:53,900
Do they...

4505
02:53:53,900 --> 02:53:54,340
Hahaha!

4506
02:53:54,420 --> 02:53:55,280
Is this infinite?

4507
02:53:55,440 --> 02:53:56,160
Is this infinite?

4508
02:53:56,300 --> 02:53:56,960
Is this infinite?

4509
02:53:57,300 --> 02:53:57,860
Hahaha!

4510
02:53:58,920 --> 02:54:01,060
The most important question!

4511
02:54:01,580 --> 02:54:02,140
Hahaha!

4512
02:54:02,780 --> 02:54:03,340
Hahaha!

4513
02:54:05,800 --> 02:54:06,360
Alright.

4514
02:54:06,500 --> 02:54:06,740
Goodbye.

4515
02:54:07,060 --> 02:54:07,340
Goodbye.

4516
02:54:08,760 --> 02:54:10,760
Oh, thank god there's always an end.

4517
02:54:11,840 --> 02:54:13,080
Oh, thank god!

4518
02:54:14,460 --> 02:54:16,220
There's always an end, guys!

4519
02:54:18,520 --> 02:54:20,060
There's always an end!

4520
02:54:21,440 --> 02:54:22,140
Don't worry!

4521
02:54:22,400 --> 02:54:22,840
Oh my god.

4522
02:54:22,920 --> 02:54:23,520
Chop, chop, chop!

4523
02:54:23,800 --> 02:54:24,280
Nooooo!

4524
02:54:25,120 --> 02:54:25,600
Hahaha!

4525
02:54:26,900 --> 02:54:27,380
Hahaha!

4526
02:54:31,260 --> 02:54:32,500
It makes me happy.

4527
02:54:32,660 --> 02:54:33,520
What the fuck?

4528
02:54:33,540 --> 02:54:34,000
Okay!

4529
02:54:34,100 --> 02:54:36,240
It doesn't chop him, but it chops you.

4530
02:54:39,320 --> 02:54:39,900
That's five.

4531
02:54:42,620 --> 02:54:43,960
Where's he gonna... It's okay.

4532
02:54:44,000 --> 02:54:44,940
There's ammo right there.

4533
02:54:46,020 --> 02:54:46,700
That's five.

4534
02:54:48,280 --> 02:54:50,180
Thank god there's always an end.

4535
02:54:50,620 --> 02:54:52,000
Thank fucking god.

4536
02:54:52,420 --> 02:54:52,700
Hahaha!

4537
02:54:55,000 --> 02:54:55,560
Ashley?!

4538
02:54:55,560 --> 02:54:57,520
Who told you to get out of the locker?

4539
02:54:58,220 --> 02:54:59,620
Who told you?

4540
02:54:59,660 --> 02:55:00,700
Cause it's not me.

4541
02:55:01,960 --> 02:55:04,520
I know for sure it was not me.

4542
02:55:06,880 --> 02:55:08,520
Ashley, get back in that locker.

4543
02:55:08,540 --> 02:55:09,000
Ashley.

4544
02:55:09,360 --> 02:55:10,240
Get back.

4545
02:55:10,240 --> 02:55:10,640
Hahaha!

4546
02:55:11,960 --> 02:55:12,260
Hahaha!

4547
02:55:13,100 --> 02:55:15,320
Go back into that locker.

4548
02:55:16,500 --> 02:55:18,580
Leon did not say get out.

4549
02:55:19,180 --> 02:55:19,780
Hahaha!

4550
02:55:21,640 --> 02:55:22,940
Go back in here.

4551
02:55:23,020 --> 02:55:24,240
I know there was a locker here.

4552
02:55:24,560 --> 02:55:26,140
Ashley, get... Oh my god.

4553
02:55:26,180 --> 02:55:26,380
No!

4554
02:55:26,640 --> 02:55:28,380
I can't keep you here forever?

4555
02:55:29,900 --> 02:55:30,500
Nooooo!

4556
02:55:32,700 --> 02:55:34,980
Ashley, why do you do this?

4557
02:55:35,020 --> 02:55:36,200
Do you hate me, Ashley?

4558
02:55:36,540 --> 02:55:37,140
Hahaha!

4559
02:55:39,280 --> 02:55:46,860
Ashley, I only had one simple request and it's for you to live in that locker until I was done.

4560
02:55:48,320 --> 02:55:50,200
Do you hate me, Ashley?

4561
02:55:51,340 --> 02:55:52,820
Ashley, I'm not gaslighting you.

4562
02:55:52,940 --> 02:55:54,300
Do you just hate me?

4563
02:55:54,620 --> 02:55:55,140
Hahaha!

4564
02:55:56,920 --> 02:55:57,440
Hahaha!

4565
02:56:00,700 --> 02:56:01,220
Alright.

4566
02:56:01,680 --> 02:56:02,300
Here we go.

4567
02:56:02,640 --> 02:56:03,760
No, I'm... I'm okay.

4568
02:56:04,280 --> 02:56:06,600
The locker is your home now, Ashley.

4569
02:56:06,780 --> 02:56:07,740
Never leave.

4570
02:56:08,200 --> 02:56:10,960
Seems this isn't your first time running from creeps.

4571
02:56:11,520 --> 02:56:12,500
Bro, what?

4572
02:56:14,360 --> 02:56:14,880
Bro!

4573
02:56:14,880 --> 02:56:15,400
Leon!

4574
02:56:15,840 --> 02:56:16,360
Bro!

4575
02:56:17,240 --> 02:56:17,760
Hahaha!

4576
02:56:19,220 --> 02:56:21,200
Bro, what the fuck, Leon?

4577
02:56:21,720 --> 02:56:23,100
That is inappropriate!

4578
02:56:25,220 --> 02:56:27,240
I wonder if I can craft more rifle.

4579
02:56:27,420 --> 02:56:28,160
Okay, I need two more.

4580
02:56:28,340 --> 02:56:30,180
I feel like I definitely need more rifle.

4581
02:56:31,360 --> 02:56:31,880
Okay.

4582
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:33,960
Let me put some of this away.

4583
02:56:34,840 --> 02:56:35,880
And then...

4584
02:56:35,880 --> 02:56:38,180
Oh wait, I'm gonna put this here, actually.

4585
02:56:39,260 --> 02:56:39,780
Yeah.

4586
02:56:40,240 --> 02:56:41,900
This is like a mess again.

4587
02:56:42,120 --> 02:56:42,760
But that's okay.

4588
02:56:48,350 --> 02:56:49,170
Alright, nice.

4589
02:56:49,670 --> 02:56:50,590
Map updated.

4590
02:56:51,030 --> 02:56:51,610
Here we go.

4591
02:56:52,530 --> 02:56:54,750
Gotta make sure everything is reloaded.

4592
02:56:56,890 --> 02:56:57,370
Right.

4593
02:56:58,030 --> 02:57:00,610
Jesus Christ, the objective is all the way there.

4594
02:57:00,710 --> 02:57:01,330
Oh my god.

4595
02:57:01,390 --> 02:57:02,050
I'd be like...

4596
02:57:04,490 --> 02:57:05,710
And then I'd have to go...

4597
02:57:06,230 --> 02:57:08,050
Okay, that is a lot of walking.

4598
02:57:08,890 --> 02:57:10,250
And a lot of shooting.

4599
02:57:11,790 --> 02:57:12,270
Oh.

4600
02:57:13,530 --> 02:57:13,630
I'm gonna go back in here.

4601
02:57:14,190 --> 02:57:15,690
Bro, get that loot.

4602
02:57:18,550 --> 02:57:20,230
God, I don't need more money!

4603
02:57:20,490 --> 02:57:22,130
I can't buy anything!

4604
02:57:23,250 --> 02:57:23,850
Please!

4605
02:57:26,250 --> 02:57:26,850
Please.

4606
02:57:27,410 --> 02:57:30,310
I can't even buy anything, so there's no point.

4607
02:57:33,190 --> 02:57:33,790
Okay.

4608
02:57:33,790 --> 02:57:34,670
Drop down.

4609
02:57:38,470 --> 02:57:40,670
No, I'm not autosorting.

4610
02:57:41,310 --> 02:57:41,870
I'm not!

4611
02:57:43,530 --> 02:57:45,730
I'm not gonna become an iPad kid!

4612
02:57:47,610 --> 02:57:49,270
I can Tetris!

4613
02:57:49,490 --> 02:57:50,590
I can Tetris!

4614
02:57:50,650 --> 02:57:53,890
I don't need a computer to Tetris for me!

4615
02:57:56,950 --> 02:57:58,350
Okay, let's see.

4616
02:57:58,610 --> 02:57:58,910
Okay, let's see.

4617
02:57:58,910 --> 02:57:59,590
Yeah, we got ammo.

4618
02:58:00,190 --> 02:58:02,030
How much ammo do we have?

4619
02:58:03,270 --> 02:58:05,830
Yeah, I think we need more rifle ammo.

4620
02:58:06,510 --> 02:58:09,950
Let me combine these herbs together.

4621
02:58:11,270 --> 02:58:12,830
Craft rifle ammo.

4622
02:58:14,490 --> 02:58:15,550
Okay, there you go.

4623
02:58:15,610 --> 02:58:17,050
This is a little better now.

4624
02:58:18,570 --> 02:58:19,670
Yeah, this is...

4625
02:58:19,670 --> 02:58:20,650
Oh my gosh, this is good.

4626
02:58:21,290 --> 02:58:21,850
Alright.

4627
02:58:23,510 --> 02:58:24,290
Here we go.

4628
02:58:26,030 --> 02:58:26,870
I know!

4629
02:58:27,110 --> 02:58:27,870
I know!

4630
02:58:28,150 --> 02:58:30,870
AI has evolved so much!

4631
02:58:31,550 --> 02:58:31,770
Okay.

4632
02:58:32,830 --> 02:58:34,850
But I have the Doki way.

4633
02:58:35,510 --> 02:58:36,070
Whoa!

4634
02:58:36,370 --> 02:58:37,670
Adam Sandler?!

4635
02:58:37,670 --> 02:58:39,050
Adam Sandler!

4636
02:58:39,150 --> 02:58:40,590
Think about your Netflix deals!

4637
02:58:41,430 --> 02:58:42,930
Oh my god.

4638
02:58:43,430 --> 02:58:44,190
Oh!

4639
02:58:46,470 --> 02:58:48,750
Oh no, not more.

4640
02:58:53,450 --> 02:58:54,210
Bro,

4641
02:58:57,630 --> 02:58:58,070
what?

4642
02:58:59,410 --> 02:59:01,790
Bro, what fucking protein do you have?

4643
02:59:03,230 --> 02:59:05,010
Can he die?!

4644
02:59:05,010 --> 02:59:06,650
Can he die?!

4645
02:59:06,650 --> 02:59:07,990
Oh, flee!

4646
02:59:08,210 --> 02:59:09,770
Okay, he cannot die.

4647
02:59:10,050 --> 02:59:11,270
We just run.

4648
02:59:13,690 --> 02:59:14,290
Guys.

4649
02:59:14,590 --> 02:59:15,630
He can't die.

4650
02:59:16,350 --> 02:59:16,990
Don't worry!

4651
02:59:19,130 --> 02:59:21,270
Go, go, go, go, go!

4652
02:59:25,900 --> 02:59:26,740
Go away, Ashley!

4653
02:59:27,880 --> 02:59:28,480
Ah!

4654
02:59:30,700 --> 02:59:31,300
Bro!

4655
02:59:34,220 --> 02:59:35,500
Ashley, just run!

4656
02:59:36,500 --> 02:59:37,340
This way.

4657
02:59:37,480 --> 02:59:38,280
This way.

4658
02:59:38,420 --> 02:59:39,220
This way.

4659
02:59:42,380 --> 02:59:43,580
Ashley, please!

4660
02:59:44,820 --> 02:59:46,040
We need to go!

4661
02:59:46,800 --> 02:59:48,220
Oh my god!

4662
02:59:48,620 --> 02:59:48,800
Oh my god!

4663
02:59:52,160 --> 02:59:53,620
He can't die!

4664
02:59:54,640 --> 02:59:56,100
Bro, this is...

4665
02:59:56,800 --> 02:59:58,660
The power of religion.

4666
03:00:01,740 --> 03:00:03,020
We did it.

4667
03:00:03,980 --> 03:00:04,660
Yeah.

4668
03:00:06,020 --> 03:00:06,980
That's fucking right.

4669
03:00:07,240 --> 03:00:09,040
Your god can't save you.

4670
03:00:09,960 --> 03:00:11,920
Tell your god to make you fly.

4671
03:00:12,260 --> 03:00:12,600
Yeah.

4672
03:00:14,000 --> 03:00:14,920
Guys, welcome!

4673
03:00:14,920 --> 03:00:16,100
Thank you for the one gift!

4674
03:00:16,200 --> 03:00:16,800
Thank you!

4675
03:00:19,400 --> 03:00:20,300
Oh, thank god.

4676
03:00:20,340 --> 03:00:21,060
Okay, we did it.

4677
03:00:23,220 --> 03:00:25,000
The power of the bible.

4678
03:00:25,140 --> 03:00:26,100
You just gotta believe.

4679
03:00:26,540 --> 03:00:27,020
Doki.

4680
03:00:29,640 --> 03:00:30,820
Oh, thank god.

4681
03:00:30,840 --> 03:00:31,320
There he is.

4682
03:00:34,920 --> 03:00:35,920
God, please!

4683
03:00:36,300 --> 03:00:37,120
Where is the ammo?

4684
03:00:38,940 --> 03:00:39,840
Oh, thank god.

4685
03:00:39,840 --> 03:00:40,580
Okay, there we go.

4686
03:00:40,680 --> 03:00:41,320
There's the ammo.

4687
03:00:42,240 --> 03:00:43,560
Why not trees?

4688
03:00:43,840 --> 03:00:44,240
Welcome!

4689
03:00:44,700 --> 03:00:47,460
You got a selection of good things on sale.

4690
03:00:47,460 --> 03:00:49,180
Okay, a key... Oh, did I use up everything?

4691
03:00:49,420 --> 03:00:51,840
Wait, I think that key is like finished, right?

4692
03:00:52,160 --> 03:00:52,640
Yeah.

4693
03:00:52,760 --> 03:00:54,040
I can sell this now.

4694
03:00:55,200 --> 03:00:55,680
Welcome!

4695
03:00:55,680 --> 03:00:56,380
And then...

4696
03:00:56,380 --> 03:00:59,220
This doesn't have any holes in it, so...

4697
03:00:59,220 --> 03:01:00,000
Yeah, it doesn't.

4698
03:01:00,000 --> 03:01:01,080
Alright, so we're good here.

4699
03:01:02,060 --> 03:01:02,540
And...

4700
03:01:02,540 --> 03:01:05,060
Oh, I can do like a combo... Oh, wait!

4701
03:01:05,060 --> 03:01:06,040
I can do a combo for this!

4702
03:01:06,460 --> 03:01:08,160
Alright, let's do a combo first.

4703
03:01:08,160 --> 03:01:09,800
Uh, 7000.

4704
03:01:10,000 --> 03:01:11,920
Obviously, we'll do the chalice.

4705
03:01:11,920 --> 03:01:13,780
Because that one has the best one.

4706
03:01:14,060 --> 03:01:14,820
Alright, wait.

4707
03:01:14,940 --> 03:01:15,120
Oh.

4708
03:01:15,380 --> 03:01:16,920
Wait, I can do three, right?

4709
03:01:17,060 --> 03:01:17,520
333?

4710
03:01:17,760 --> 03:01:18,760
Three is the best?

4711
03:01:19,800 --> 03:01:21,700
Three... Yeah, three gemstones.

4712
03:01:21,760 --> 03:01:22,380
Yes, okay.

4713
03:01:22,700 --> 03:01:22,980
Boop.

4714
03:01:24,000 --> 03:01:24,560
Boop.

4715
03:01:25,380 --> 03:01:25,940
Boop.

4716
03:01:26,060 --> 03:01:26,400
Nice.

4717
03:01:26,720 --> 03:01:28,980
My shiny chalice is complete now.

4718
03:01:29,180 --> 03:01:30,040
And then we'll...

4719
03:01:30,040 --> 03:01:32,680
This is the three different colors.

4720
03:01:34,240 --> 03:01:34,800
Yay!

4721
03:01:36,380 --> 03:01:36,940
Hey!

4722
03:01:38,160 --> 03:01:38,420
Beautiful!

4723
03:01:40,700 --> 03:01:42,020
Alright, sell time.

4724
03:01:42,280 --> 03:01:44,120
Sell, sell, sell...

4725
03:01:45,180 --> 03:01:46,340
Sell, sell...

4726
03:01:46,340 --> 03:01:46,800
Oh my god!

4727
03:01:47,040 --> 03:01:48,240
Guys, don't talk to me anymore.

4728
03:01:50,560 --> 03:01:51,500
What is...

4729
03:01:51,500 --> 03:01:52,160
What is...

4730
03:01:52,920 --> 03:01:53,500
Guys...

4731
03:01:54,520 --> 03:01:56,540
Talk to me when you have the chalice.

4732
03:02:00,360 --> 03:02:02,400
I'm in the next tax bracket.

4733
03:02:04,340 --> 03:02:07,740
That cash in your pocket for your life.

4734
03:02:08,860 --> 03:02:09,460
Okay.

4735
03:02:09,580 --> 03:02:10,600
I did it.

4736
03:02:10,640 --> 03:02:13,060
I made it to the next tax bracket.

4737
03:02:13,100 --> 03:02:13,720
Let's go!

4738
03:02:14,480 --> 03:02:19,320
A well-tuned weapon can make up for a lack of skill, friend.

4739
03:02:19,760 --> 03:02:22,860
Damn, money really does change people.

4740
03:02:23,300 --> 03:02:24,340
Okay, let's see.

4741
03:02:24,420 --> 03:02:25,100
We gonna...

4742
03:02:25,100 --> 03:02:27,060
I don't think I need any of this.

4743
03:02:28,080 --> 03:02:29,680
She leveled that.

4744
03:02:32,720 --> 03:02:36,060
What am I gonna do with all this useless money?

4745
03:02:36,060 --> 03:02:36,380
Money!

4746
03:02:38,700 --> 03:02:41,700
I can't pay them to stop shooting me!

4747
03:02:43,660 --> 03:02:44,580
Be careful.

4748
03:02:45,060 --> 03:02:46,240
Be careful?

4749
03:02:46,500 --> 03:02:46,780
Why?

4750
03:02:48,400 --> 03:02:49,800
What are... Oh, wait.

4751
03:02:49,880 --> 03:02:50,860
Is this the...

4752
03:02:52,120 --> 03:02:55,860
Is this the fucking thing where, like, he turns into a bat?

4753
03:02:56,200 --> 03:02:57,560
She sold out.

4754
03:03:00,640 --> 03:03:02,560
Wait, is this the bat level?

4755
03:03:04,320 --> 03:03:05,380
Oh, fuck!

4756
03:03:05,640 --> 03:03:07,060
This is the bat level!

4757
03:03:07,360 --> 03:03:07,660
Okay.

4758
03:03:08,900 --> 03:03:11,340
Yeah, I'm gonna... I feel like I should buy the rocket launcher.

4759
03:03:12,420 --> 03:03:16,000
Alright, is it worth to buy the rocket launcher for the fucking Batman?

4760
03:03:19,400 --> 03:03:20,840
Oh, I missed out on this ammo.

4761
03:03:21,080 --> 03:03:21,720
Where the fuck?

4762
03:03:21,880 --> 03:03:22,740
Where's... Oh, there it is.

4763
03:03:23,840 --> 03:03:26,000
All this money in...

4764
03:03:26,620 --> 03:03:28,100
Well, you told... No!

4765
03:03:28,240 --> 03:03:29,020
No, it's not?

4766
03:03:29,200 --> 03:03:29,460
Okay.

4767
03:03:29,460 --> 03:03:30,560
You know what?

4768
03:03:30,660 --> 03:03:31,740
I'll... I'll fucking...

4769
03:03:31,740 --> 03:03:34,000
I'll do... Okay, cause he's the bat.

4770
03:03:34,180 --> 03:03:35,100
I'm gonna do it...

4771
03:03:35,100 --> 03:03:36,640
I have that money for this!

4772
03:03:36,700 --> 03:03:38,400
I'll just do the ammo capacity.

4773
03:03:38,920 --> 03:03:39,700
There we go.

4774
03:03:39,840 --> 03:03:41,420
Then I can have more ammo now.

4775
03:03:43,680 --> 03:03:45,480
I didn't put more ammo in there.

4776
03:03:46,600 --> 03:03:47,080
Okay.

4777
03:03:47,720 --> 03:03:48,200
Alright.

4778
03:03:50,720 --> 03:03:51,480
Here we go.

4779
03:03:52,060 --> 03:03:53,100
It's bat time.

4780
03:03:54,980 --> 03:03:55,460
Alright.

4781
03:03:56,560 --> 03:03:57,780
It's Batman time.

4782
03:03:57,880 --> 03:03:58,840
We don't need reload.

4783
03:03:59,460 --> 03:03:59,900
We're gamers.

4784
03:04:02,140 --> 03:04:02,660
Alright.

4785
03:04:02,740 --> 03:04:03,340
Here we go.

4786
03:04:03,540 --> 03:04:04,540
It's Batman time.

4787
03:04:04,960 --> 03:04:05,360
Batman!

4788
03:04:06,080 --> 03:04:06,600
Oh!

4789
03:04:09,220 --> 03:04:11,240
By God, he did learn to fly.

4790
03:04:11,400 --> 03:04:14,120
I told him to learn to fly and God gave him the power.

4791
03:04:15,000 --> 03:04:16,360
What's your religion, sir?

4792
03:04:16,460 --> 03:04:17,360
Can I join it?

4793
03:04:18,180 --> 03:04:24,200
I mean, if I ask for flying powers and I instantly get it, maybe it's a good religion!

4794
03:04:31,780 --> 03:04:33,040
You're a shitty missionary.

4795
03:04:33,240 --> 03:04:34,120
You know that.

4796
03:04:37,990 --> 03:04:38,990
Oh, almighty.

4797
03:04:40,170 --> 03:04:44,050
Grant me the strength to crush your enemies.

4798
03:04:45,550 --> 03:04:46,530
Son of a bitch!

4799
03:04:48,070 --> 03:04:49,030
Ashley, run!

4800
03:04:49,430 --> 03:04:50,330
Run, Ashley!

4801
03:04:50,470 --> 03:04:51,170
Find the locker!

4802
03:04:53,810 --> 03:04:55,110
Find a locker, Ashley!

4803
03:04:56,430 --> 03:04:57,450
Oh, fuck!

4804
03:04:57,850 --> 03:04:58,890
This is where I die.

4805
03:04:59,350 --> 03:05:01,030
Sleep, think of a tent and get the chip!

4806
03:05:01,110 --> 03:05:01,970
I just think of thank you!

4807
03:05:03,850 --> 03:05:05,050
Oh, uh...

4808
03:05:06,370 --> 03:05:07,970
You wanna get ugly?

4809
03:05:08,090 --> 03:05:08,770
Oh, God.

4810
03:05:09,170 --> 03:05:10,110
Let's get ugly.

4811
03:05:10,110 --> 03:05:11,390
Don't worry, I have the rifle.

4812
03:05:13,450 --> 03:05:14,050
Okay.

4813
03:05:14,370 --> 03:05:15,310
Do headshots!

4814
03:05:15,490 --> 03:05:16,250
Oh, shit!

4815
03:05:16,890 --> 03:05:18,410
Oh, I'm sorry!

4816
03:05:19,110 --> 03:05:20,970
I have kitchen knife!

4817
03:05:31,070 --> 03:05:33,930
I'm... Okay, those quick time events were way too quick.

4818
03:05:36,810 --> 03:05:37,410
Shank!

4819
03:05:38,650 --> 03:05:39,130
Shank!

4820
03:05:39,490 --> 03:05:41,890
To think you could be this foolish.

4821
03:05:42,330 --> 03:05:42,990
Control!

4822
03:05:44,150 --> 03:05:45,410
Okay, that's dumb.

4823
03:05:46,630 --> 03:05:47,290
Judgement!

4824
03:05:49,510 --> 03:05:50,450
Oh, God.

4825
03:05:51,170 --> 03:05:52,010
Oh, God.

4826
03:05:52,450 --> 03:05:53,490
Oh, what?!

4827
03:05:54,810 --> 03:05:55,990
Oh, my God!

4828
03:05:56,130 --> 03:05:57,130
Please get up!

4829
03:05:57,570 --> 03:05:58,230
Please!

4830
03:05:58,550 --> 03:05:59,090
Ah!

4831
03:05:59,650 --> 03:06:00,310
Spray!

4832
03:06:01,250 --> 03:06:03,370
The real quick time...

4833
03:06:03,370 --> 03:06:05,910
The really, really quick time event.

4834
03:06:07,570 --> 03:06:09,190
Oh, my God!

4835
03:06:09,330 --> 03:06:09,890
Stop!

4836
03:06:11,430 --> 03:06:12,070
Knife!

4837
03:06:12,070 --> 03:06:12,710
Stop!

4838
03:06:12,810 --> 03:06:13,830
I need a reload!

4839
03:06:17,430 --> 03:06:18,070
Evade!

4840
03:06:18,070 --> 03:06:19,050
Super quick!

4841
03:06:19,330 --> 03:06:19,870
Evade!

4842
03:06:20,670 --> 03:06:21,310
I!

4843
03:06:25,930 --> 03:06:26,570
Okay.

4844
03:06:26,890 --> 03:06:27,830
There we go.

4845
03:06:30,990 --> 03:06:32,430
Aim for the spine?

4846
03:06:32,970 --> 03:06:34,350
How the fuck was I...

4847
03:06:34,350 --> 03:06:35,890
Guys, I can't tell what I'm doing.

4848
03:06:35,890 --> 03:06:36,490
What's ahead?

4849
03:06:36,670 --> 03:06:37,230
What's...

4850
03:06:37,230 --> 03:06:39,110
What's ahead and what's not?

4851
03:06:44,350 --> 03:06:50,070
Okay, now I know why we up... Guys, now I know why we fucking up...

4852
03:06:51,530 --> 03:06:54,350
Why we have to upgrade reload.

4853
03:06:54,770 --> 03:06:56,090
Now I understand.

4854
03:06:56,350 --> 03:06:57,610
Wait, the seat...

4855
03:06:57,610 --> 03:06:58,510
Does that not take damage?

4856
03:06:59,170 --> 03:07:00,650
Like, does this not matter?

4857
03:07:04,370 --> 03:07:05,250
Oh, fuck!

4858
03:07:05,330 --> 03:07:05,750
Fire!

4859
03:07:07,490 --> 03:07:08,210
There we go.

4860
03:07:08,710 --> 03:07:09,150
Okay.

4861
03:07:10,130 --> 03:07:10,570
Alright.

4862
03:07:11,890 --> 03:07:12,470
It's okay.

4863
03:07:12,570 --> 03:07:13,910
He's gotta pick it up again.

4864
03:07:16,290 --> 03:07:16,730
Dodge!

4865
03:07:16,730 --> 03:07:17,090
Ouch!

4866
03:07:17,350 --> 03:07:17,670
Okay.

4867
03:07:17,850 --> 03:07:19,490
Okay, I didn't dodge, guys.

4868
03:07:19,750 --> 03:07:20,370
It's okay.

4869
03:07:20,890 --> 03:07:21,510
It's okay.

4870
03:07:21,570 --> 03:07:22,490
I can tank another one.

4871
03:07:22,990 --> 03:07:24,190
I can tank anoth...

4872
03:07:24,190 --> 03:07:25,310
There we go.

4873
03:07:25,610 --> 03:07:26,330
There we go.

4874
03:07:26,370 --> 03:07:27,530
I can tank one more hit.

4875
03:07:27,750 --> 03:07:29,050
You gotta pick up the barrel.

4876
03:07:29,050 --> 03:07:29,630
It's like Mario.

4877
03:07:30,190 --> 03:07:30,630
I can tank one more hit.

4878
03:07:30,630 --> 03:07:30,630
You gotta pick up the barrel.

4879
03:07:30,630 --> 03:07:30,630
It's like Mario.

4880
03:07:30,650 --> 03:07:32,250
Oh, he doesn't pick up the barrel!

4881
03:07:32,530 --> 03:07:33,810
It's not like Mario!

4882
03:07:34,070 --> 03:07:35,470
It's not like Mario!

4883
03:07:39,190 --> 03:07:41,150
Guys, I made a mistake.

4884
03:07:41,370 --> 03:07:42,570
It was not like Mario.

4885
03:07:42,890 --> 03:07:46,410
Guys, it was 100% not like Mario.

4886
03:07:50,950 --> 03:07:53,310
Guys, it was not like Mario, guys.

4887
03:07:53,370 --> 03:07:53,830
I learned.

4888
03:07:57,770 --> 03:08:00,430
It was definitely not like Mario.

4889
03:08:02,370 --> 03:08:03,510
Oh, shit!

4890
03:08:03,910 --> 03:08:04,510
Bro!

4891
03:08:05,390 --> 03:08:06,370
Oh, shit!

4892
03:08:06,410 --> 03:08:06,530
Bro!

4893
03:08:06,530 --> 03:08:06,530
Oh, shit!

4894
03:08:06,530 --> 03:08:07,630
The actual Quick-dive!

4895
03:08:12,460 --> 03:08:13,060
Okay.

4896
03:08:13,060 --> 03:08:14,180
There we go.

4897
03:08:15,880 --> 03:08:16,480
Okay.

4898
03:08:16,480 --> 03:08:16,720
There we go.

4899
03:08:17,000 --> 03:08:18,780
The weird Mario.

4900
03:08:23,860 --> 03:08:26,080
Okay, this is not a platform.

4901
03:08:26,340 --> 03:08:27,140
Oh, shit!

4902
03:08:27,360 --> 03:08:27,700
An eye.

4903
03:08:28,360 --> 03:08:29,680
Just like Mario.

4904
03:08:40,200 --> 03:08:41,400
Oh, there we go.

4905
03:08:41,800 --> 03:08:42,240
Oh, there we go.

4906
03:08:42,240 --> 03:08:42,820
I knew it.

4907
03:08:42,840 --> 03:08:44,680
Hoarding was always the right answer.

4908
03:08:48,590 --> 03:08:49,030
Alright!

4909
03:08:49,210 --> 03:08:49,650
Here we go.

4910
03:08:50,830 --> 03:08:51,990
Thank you for the eye.

4911
03:08:52,970 --> 03:08:54,730
Give my regards to your god.

4912
03:08:55,650 --> 03:08:56,610
Is there any loot?

4913
03:08:56,790 --> 03:08:57,770
Okay, nice.

4914
03:08:58,070 --> 03:08:58,710
Oh, my god!

4915
03:08:58,770 --> 03:08:59,810
There was a lot of loot.

4916
03:09:00,090 --> 03:09:01,370
Give me a sec, Ashley!

4917
03:09:01,730 --> 03:09:03,010
I need the loot!

4918
03:09:03,890 --> 03:09:07,950
Guys, I might be inhaling a lot of smoke, Ashley, Ashley, but this is important!

4919
03:09:08,890 --> 03:09:11,150
This is very important to Leon!

4920
03:09:11,870 --> 03:09:12,890
Give me a sec!

4921
03:09:13,310 --> 03:09:14,950
Okay, let's see...

4922
03:09:15,650 --> 03:09:20,110
Look, I know I'm inhaling a lot of smoke right now, Ashley, but you don't understand.

4923
03:09:22,210 --> 03:09:22,730
Alright.

4924
03:09:24,650 --> 03:09:25,670
There's a ladder?

4925
03:09:25,830 --> 03:09:26,310
Oh, there is!

4926
03:09:26,670 --> 03:09:27,570
Okay, here we go.

4927
03:09:28,010 --> 03:09:28,730
Don't worry.

4928
03:09:28,830 --> 03:09:31,810
This fire is really fucking hot, but don't worry.

4929
03:09:33,470 --> 03:09:34,650
It's dangerous!

4930
03:09:35,970 --> 03:09:37,510
Ashley, you don't understand.

4931
03:09:38,210 --> 03:09:40,690
My love for loot transcends danger.

4932
03:09:41,790 --> 03:09:43,590
She will never understand.

4933
03:09:46,870 --> 03:09:48,310
Okay, oh, that is herb.

4934
03:09:48,770 --> 03:09:49,850
That is herb.

4935
03:09:50,350 --> 03:09:51,530
Okay, let's see.

4936
03:09:51,830 --> 03:09:53,330
We can combine that.

4937
03:09:53,590 --> 03:09:57,070
And then we definitely need more...

4938
03:09:57,070 --> 03:09:59,270
Wait, do I... Okay, we need more shotgun ammo.

4939
03:09:59,930 --> 03:10:01,630
Alright, let's just reload that.

4940
03:10:02,890 --> 03:10:04,250
And then...

4941
03:10:04,250 --> 03:10:06,630
Alright, I'm gonna definitely upgrade reload speed.

4942
03:10:06,930 --> 03:10:12,210
I realized my mistake when I said I'm not upgrading reload speed.

4943
03:10:12,370 --> 03:10:14,590
I realized that might have been a mistake.

4944
03:10:14,890 --> 03:10:16,050
Did I just... Okay.

4945
03:10:17,030 --> 03:10:19,110
Guys, we didn't see that.

4946
03:10:22,590 --> 03:10:24,490
Wait, I missed him?

4947
03:10:24,590 --> 03:10:25,010
Nooooo!

4948
03:10:36,540 --> 03:10:37,600
Ashley, no!

4949
03:10:38,420 --> 03:10:38,900
Thanks.

4950
03:10:43,640 --> 03:10:44,120
Nooooo.

4951
03:10:45,560 --> 03:10:47,280
This fire is bound to catch their attention.

4952
03:10:48,040 --> 03:10:48,520
Nooooo!

4953
03:10:50,280 --> 03:10:53,180
Leon, you're not gonna turn into one of them, right?

4954
03:10:53,660 --> 03:10:54,140
Nooooo.

4955
03:10:55,320 --> 03:10:56,220
I don't know.

4956
03:10:57,140 --> 03:10:59,260
Maybe their god is, like, worth it.

4957
03:10:59,420 --> 03:11:00,900
Like, they get special powers.

4958
03:11:02,240 --> 03:11:03,800
I grabbed the eyeball though.

4959
03:11:03,960 --> 03:11:05,040
I got the eyeball.

4960
03:11:05,360 --> 03:11:07,000
At least I have the cool eye.

4961
03:11:08,220 --> 03:11:09,820
I can't believe it.

4962
03:11:10,240 --> 03:11:12,040
I can't believe it.

4963
03:11:12,200 --> 03:11:14,660
That loot... What do you mean always see that map?

4964
03:11:14,720 --> 03:11:15,580
There's literally nothing!

4965
03:11:21,000 --> 03:11:23,360
Oh, that loot...

4966
03:11:23,360 --> 03:11:25,560
It wasn't treasure, right?

4967
03:11:28,300 --> 03:11:33,000
If Ashley turns into a monster and Leon kills her, does she drop loot?

4968
03:11:33,100 --> 03:11:34,200
Very good question!

4969
03:11:36,160 --> 03:11:37,560
Very good question!

4970
03:11:40,200 --> 03:11:40,680
Okay.

4971
03:11:41,800 --> 03:11:42,600
There we are.

4972
03:11:42,660 --> 03:11:43,480
Alright, let's see.

4973
03:11:44,640 --> 03:11:46,260
Wait, there's a treasure behind me.

4974
03:11:46,360 --> 03:11:48,020
Ashley, there's a treasure behind us.

4975
03:11:49,080 --> 03:11:49,880
Where is it?

4976
03:11:51,560 --> 03:11:52,620
More is looking up.

4977
03:11:52,720 --> 03:11:53,280
There it is.

4978
03:11:55,000 --> 03:11:57,180
Thank god I didn't see... I saw that.

4979
03:12:00,140 --> 03:12:00,820
Thank god.

4980
03:12:00,860 --> 03:12:02,160
This time I looked at the map.

4981
03:12:02,700 --> 03:12:04,180
Do you think Leon can use damage?

4982
03:12:04,200 --> 03:12:05,920
Or just shot... Dude, look at him.

4983
03:12:06,380 --> 03:12:11,600
Unless he's a fucking greasy ass dude, I'm pretty sure he uses...

4984
03:12:11,600 --> 03:12:13,120
No, there's no way.

4985
03:12:13,240 --> 03:12:15,240
Leon definitely is not like...

4986
03:12:15,240 --> 03:12:16,800
He's not a NEET.

4987
03:12:16,900 --> 03:12:19,520
So like, I'm pretty sure he uses conditioner.

4988
03:12:20,660 --> 03:12:22,560
He wants to continue the bloodline.

4989
03:12:25,480 --> 03:12:28,840
Well, at least we don't have to worry about being followed.

4990
03:12:29,700 --> 03:12:30,380
Come on.

4991
03:12:33,850 --> 03:12:36,550
Yeah, his hair is way too shiny for no conditioner.

4992
03:12:36,550 --> 03:12:39,710
I actually... I don't use conditioner because like...

4993
03:12:39,710 --> 03:12:44,630
I used to swim a lot as a kid.

4994
03:12:44,950 --> 03:12:47,110
And because of that, I fucked up my hair.

4995
03:12:47,450 --> 03:12:52,470
Because like as Asian parents do, they make their kid do lots of swimming lessons.

4996
03:12:52,810 --> 03:12:55,010
They make your kid do a lot of different lessons.

4997
03:12:55,090 --> 03:12:58,410
So then I like did a lot of like swimming lessons and stuff.

4998
03:12:58,710 --> 03:13:03,550
I never got past a single level because I couldn't do the butterfly stroke or like the frog.

4999
03:13:04,230 --> 03:13:06,130
I call it the frog because they called it a frog.

5000
03:13:06,130 --> 03:13:07,570
And I like failed three...

5001
03:13:08,050 --> 03:13:12,370
I failed the class three fucking times because I could never do the frog.

5002
03:13:14,130 --> 03:13:17,730
I retook the class three fucking times.

5003
03:13:17,790 --> 03:13:18,670
And it's not like...

5004
03:13:18,670 --> 03:13:21,310
Every time you take the class, you do the frog.

5005
03:13:21,470 --> 03:13:25,230
You have to learn all the things in that class the same time.

5006
03:13:25,310 --> 03:13:25,850
Like all...

5007
03:13:25,850 --> 03:13:30,290
You have to like always learn that same thing over like all the other steps.

5008
03:13:30,370 --> 03:13:31,610
Not just the froggy thing.

5009
03:13:32,190 --> 03:13:36,070
So like, you know, I have to keep retaking it three fucking times.

5010
03:13:36,070 --> 03:13:38,310
And I could never get the frog right.

5011
03:13:38,450 --> 03:13:40,570
So I failed three fucking times.

5012
03:13:40,690 --> 03:13:43,650
And every time I had to learn the basics.

5013
03:13:43,890 --> 03:13:48,210
Front stroke, backstroke, all that shit over and over again.

5014
03:13:48,470 --> 03:13:49,950
But it's always the frog.

5015
03:13:50,050 --> 03:13:51,670
I could never do the frog.

5016
03:13:51,990 --> 03:13:54,870
Anyway, the moral of that story.

5017
03:13:55,230 --> 03:13:59,290
I don't use conditioner because like my hair like gets like natural...

5018
03:13:59,290 --> 03:13:59,950
Like it's like...

5019
03:13:59,950 --> 03:14:03,410
Gets like greasy really really quick.

5020
03:14:03,570 --> 03:14:05,930
So like I always have to take like...

5021
03:14:05,930 --> 03:14:08,830
Because of like the swimming ruined my hair.

5022
03:14:09,050 --> 03:14:11,230
So like I couldn't do conditioner anymore.

5023
03:14:11,430 --> 03:14:15,170
Because like my scalp is like super fucked up because...

5024
03:14:19,660 --> 03:14:20,490
So I...

5025
03:14:23,470 --> 03:14:26,070
So like I used to use conditioner.

5026
03:14:26,070 --> 03:14:31,350
But like I had to stop because like my hair got super fucked up that I could never...

5027
03:14:31,350 --> 03:14:32,810
I can't use conditioner anymore.

5028
03:14:39,940 --> 03:14:40,660
Let's see.

5029
03:14:42,840 --> 03:14:44,920
And that's the moral of the story.

5030
03:14:47,880 --> 03:14:48,660
All right.

5031
03:14:50,340 --> 03:14:50,860
Next.

5032
03:14:54,900 --> 03:14:55,560
Trauma dump.

5033
03:14:55,640 --> 03:14:58,060
Sorry for trauma dumping by the way.

5034
03:15:01,380 --> 03:15:02,860
Thank you for the super chat.

5035
03:15:02,920 --> 03:15:03,300
Thank you.

5036
03:15:04,840 --> 03:15:05,360
Perfect.

5037
03:15:06,880 --> 03:15:09,920
With all that chlorine you got your hair bleached for free.

5038
03:15:13,700 --> 03:15:14,140
Ciao!

5039
03:15:21,600 --> 03:15:23,000
How does he have my phone number?

5040
03:15:23,180 --> 03:15:24,520
Who gave him my phone number?

5041
03:15:24,660 --> 03:15:25,820
Did I give him my phone number?

5042
03:15:25,820 --> 03:15:26,720
Did I slip in my number?

5043
03:15:31,380 --> 03:15:36,060
Did I slip in my number before he left?

5044
03:15:36,700 --> 03:15:40,640
I was like, hee hee, haha, here's my number, hee hee, wink.

5045
03:15:45,000 --> 03:15:49,360
Oh god, all those crows, you know you owe me money, crows.

5046
03:15:52,260 --> 03:15:54,420
Okay, let's grab some fucking barrels though.

5047
03:15:54,660 --> 03:15:55,260
Nice.

5048
03:15:58,360 --> 03:15:58,980
Oh hey.

5049
03:16:00,160 --> 03:16:00,780
What's this?

5050
03:16:01,020 --> 03:16:02,220
The vintage compass!

5051
03:16:03,120 --> 03:16:04,740
That's good, that's money!

5052
03:16:06,460 --> 03:16:07,980
Where the fuck is my merchant?

5053
03:16:09,340 --> 03:16:10,300
Is he in here?

5054
03:16:12,040 --> 03:16:12,480
Merchant!

5055
03:16:14,420 --> 03:16:15,240
What do you have?

5056
03:16:17,180 --> 03:16:17,960
What is this?

5057
03:16:18,140 --> 03:16:20,000
Increase the drop rate of red herbs.

5058
03:16:20,120 --> 03:16:20,680
I don't need that.

5059
03:16:21,000 --> 03:16:21,440
Exclusive...

5060
03:16:25,120 --> 03:16:26,580
Exclusive upgrade regardless.

5061
03:16:26,880 --> 03:16:27,460
Wait, what does this say?

5062
03:16:27,480 --> 03:16:27,760
What does this mean?

5063
03:16:28,060 --> 03:16:29,200
Oh, treasure map!

5064
03:16:29,520 --> 03:16:30,040
We need that.

5065
03:16:31,660 --> 03:16:33,660
Oh, I don't have anything anymore.

5066
03:16:33,980 --> 03:16:34,540
Nevermind.

5067
03:16:36,200 --> 03:16:38,320
I can't even afford that.

5068
03:16:39,240 --> 03:16:40,920
Okay, I can't afford anything.

5069
03:16:41,120 --> 03:16:41,800
I'm poor!

5070
03:16:42,660 --> 03:16:43,220
Alright.

5071
03:16:44,260 --> 03:16:44,900
Let's see.

5072
03:16:45,480 --> 03:16:46,040
Blacktail?

5073
03:16:46,380 --> 03:16:48,320
Is my gun the strongest right now?

5074
03:16:48,500 --> 03:16:49,160
Wait, is this?

5075
03:16:49,360 --> 03:16:50,060
Oh, that's a...

5076
03:16:50,060 --> 03:16:52,040
Wait, the semi-automatic rifle.

5077
03:16:53,520 --> 03:16:55,240
The broken butterfly.

5078
03:16:55,860 --> 03:16:56,920
Oh, resources!

5079
03:16:57,380 --> 03:16:59,000
Wait, I can buy resources now!

5080
03:16:59,580 --> 03:17:00,480
Rocket launcher.

5081
03:17:01,480 --> 03:17:02,620
Magnum ammo.

5082
03:17:04,020 --> 03:17:10,380
Wait, are any of these pistols better than my original pistol?

5083
03:17:11,760 --> 03:17:12,940
Get the stingray?

5084
03:17:13,080 --> 03:17:13,520
Why?

5085
03:17:15,100 --> 03:17:15,660
Stingray.

5086
03:17:15,780 --> 03:17:17,460
Three times power against weak points.

5087
03:17:17,580 --> 03:17:18,760
Wait, is that a rifle?

5088
03:17:19,940 --> 03:17:21,060
Is that like a sniper?

5089
03:17:21,180 --> 03:17:22,400
Oh, sniper would better fire it.

5090
03:17:22,560 --> 03:17:25,080
Broken butterfly, best magnum?

5091
03:17:26,080 --> 03:17:26,720
Ooh.

5092
03:17:28,320 --> 03:17:29,860
Do I buy...

5093
03:17:30,540 --> 03:17:31,800
...a magnum?

5094
03:17:31,800 --> 03:17:33,000
Is that better than my pistol?

5095
03:17:35,180 --> 03:17:38,100
You can get... I think you get magnum for free from a puzzle?

5096
03:17:40,260 --> 03:17:42,840
Okay, I'm gonna buy the rifle.

5097
03:17:47,140 --> 03:17:50,060
This is... uh... it's on sale?

5098
03:17:50,540 --> 03:17:51,860
It's for bosses.

5099
03:17:52,300 --> 03:17:52,920
The butterfly?

5100
03:17:53,280 --> 03:17:54,420
Which one's for boss?

5101
03:17:54,420 --> 03:17:56,080
Guys, which one's for boss?

5102
03:17:58,360 --> 03:18:00,220
Oh, magnum is a boss killer?

5103
03:18:00,460 --> 03:18:01,120
Oh, that's good.

5104
03:18:01,240 --> 03:18:02,180
I love boss killers.

5105
03:18:02,440 --> 03:18:03,240
...the things.

5106
03:18:03,640 --> 03:18:05,580
Gun's not just about shooting.

5107
03:18:05,920 --> 03:18:08,220
It's about reloading.

5108
03:18:08,920 --> 03:18:11,020
You'll know what I'm talking about.

5109
03:18:12,300 --> 03:18:13,680
Go on, take this as well.

5110
03:18:13,760 --> 03:18:14,280
Oh, nice.

5111
03:18:14,380 --> 03:18:15,180
I love free stuff.

5112
03:18:15,420 --> 03:18:15,900
Thank you!

5113
03:18:16,200 --> 03:18:16,500
Knowledge is power.

5114
03:18:17,100 --> 03:18:18,520
Remember that, mate.

5115
03:18:18,740 --> 03:18:20,140
Will that be all then?

5116
03:18:20,340 --> 03:18:22,720
Okay, does that mean I can throw this away?

5117
03:18:22,720 --> 03:18:24,780
Can I throw the SR?

5118
03:18:26,460 --> 03:18:27,820
A bolt action...

5119
03:18:27,820 --> 03:18:29,060
Wait, can I sell this now?

5120
03:18:30,460 --> 03:18:30,980
Guys!

5121
03:18:31,600 --> 03:18:32,980
Can I sell this now?

5122
03:18:33,040 --> 03:18:33,480
The SR?

5123
03:18:34,640 --> 03:18:35,160
No?

5124
03:18:36,060 --> 03:18:37,320
My rifle's better?

5125
03:18:39,540 --> 03:18:40,580
Wait, guys.

5126
03:18:40,720 --> 03:18:41,740
Which rifle's better?

5127
03:18:45,200 --> 03:18:46,520
Which is better?

5128
03:18:46,680 --> 03:18:49,360
The SR or the...

5129
03:18:50,120 --> 03:18:50,640
Um...

5130
03:18:50,640 --> 03:18:52,460
SR is the better rifle for power?

5131
03:18:52,580 --> 03:18:52,700
Oh, okay.

5132
03:18:52,720 --> 03:18:54,260
I'm gonna go for SR for the power.

5133
03:18:54,420 --> 03:18:55,780
And then I'll upgrade this.

5134
03:18:58,540 --> 03:18:59,660
Singer is better...

5135
03:18:59,660 --> 03:18:59,880
Guys.

5136
03:19:00,580 --> 03:19:01,100
Guys.

5137
03:19:01,320 --> 03:19:03,120
You all have different opinions.

5138
03:19:03,360 --> 03:19:07,080
You all have different opinions.

5139
03:19:12,240 --> 03:19:13,160
Okay, I'll...

5140
03:19:18,040 --> 03:19:18,560
Trust.

5141
03:19:18,860 --> 03:19:21,000
Okay, I'm gonna trust the guy that says trust.

5142
03:19:21,980 --> 03:19:24,900
And I'll upgrade my... I'll upgrade my magnum.

5143
03:19:25,320 --> 03:19:25,880
Boom.

5144
03:19:26,000 --> 03:19:26,400
Boom.

5145
03:19:27,920 --> 03:19:28,480
Okay.

5146
03:19:29,000 --> 03:19:33,220
And then I'm gonna upgrade the reload speed of my fucking shotgun.

5147
03:19:33,840 --> 03:19:35,880
Because I realized...

5148
03:19:37,300 --> 03:19:38,560
Okay, now, guys.

5149
03:19:38,680 --> 03:19:40,060
Now you can talk to me again.

5150
03:19:40,580 --> 03:19:41,680
I'm broke again.

5151
03:19:41,900 --> 03:19:43,080
I'm broke, guys.

5152
03:19:44,840 --> 03:19:45,640
I'm broke.

5153
03:19:47,740 --> 03:19:48,880
I'm broke now.

5154
03:19:52,740 --> 03:19:53,240
I'm broke now.

5155
03:19:53,240 --> 03:19:53,840
Alright, let's see.

5156
03:19:54,060 --> 03:19:54,960
Do I have enough crafter?

5157
03:19:56,120 --> 03:19:57,720
Wait, I could've upgraded...

5158
03:19:57,720 --> 03:19:57,920
No!

5159
03:19:58,300 --> 03:20:01,000
I already used all my fucking money on suit...

5160
03:20:01,000 --> 03:20:02,660
Oh my god, where's the suitcase?

5161
03:20:02,940 --> 03:20:03,980
No, you guys are lying!

5162
03:20:04,020 --> 03:20:05,500
There's no suitcase upgrade!

5163
03:20:10,720 --> 03:20:12,180
What do you mean?

5164
03:20:12,500 --> 03:20:13,430
There's no fucking...

5165
03:20:13,820 --> 03:20:14,460
Okay, okay.

5166
03:20:14,560 --> 03:20:15,600
I almost got tricked.

5167
03:20:16,360 --> 03:20:16,860
Alright.

5168
03:20:17,580 --> 03:20:20,000
I almost got fucking lied to.

5169
03:20:20,000 --> 03:20:20,860
I was like, no!

5170
03:20:23,720 --> 03:20:24,800
Alright, it's okay.

5171
03:20:25,720 --> 03:20:26,440
Wait, what?

5172
03:20:26,720 --> 03:20:27,720
What is this?

5173
03:20:30,020 --> 03:20:31,180
Adam Sandler?

5174
03:20:34,360 --> 03:20:36,140
Oh no, it's a little boy!

5175
03:20:36,340 --> 03:20:37,160
The evil boy!

5176
03:20:38,840 --> 03:20:40,160
Tiny evil boy!

5177
03:20:45,130 --> 03:20:46,890
I can snipe all these people!

5178
03:20:52,490 --> 03:20:53,230
The dragon!

5179
03:20:53,390 --> 03:20:54,010
Thank you for the super chat!

5180
03:20:54,070 --> 03:20:54,330
Thank you!

5181
03:20:54,370 --> 03:20:54,690
Thank you!

5182
03:20:55,010 --> 03:20:56,330
What you got is for power.

5183
03:20:56,390 --> 03:20:57,790
Stinger is for DPS, which is...

5184
03:20:58,260 --> 03:21:00,430
Which one you like more is I like power.

5185
03:21:01,690 --> 03:21:03,290
Can I just snipe you now?

5186
03:21:04,330 --> 03:21:05,570
No, he's way too far.

5187
03:21:06,670 --> 03:21:08,530
I can't do 300 meters.

5188
03:21:11,710 --> 03:21:12,750
Okay, let's see.

5189
03:21:14,470 --> 03:21:16,270
Oh, we gotta go here.

5190
03:21:17,290 --> 03:21:18,490
What are you scared of?

5191
03:21:21,070 --> 03:21:26,470
Oh, I forgot to keep my voice down.

5192
03:21:27,450 --> 03:21:28,750
Okay, we go this way.

5193
03:21:31,830 --> 03:21:32,610
Let's see.

5194
03:21:34,030 --> 03:21:35,470
Yeah, we have to go this way.

5195
03:21:36,990 --> 03:21:37,530
Whoa!

5196
03:21:37,530 --> 03:21:38,150
What's that?

5197
03:21:38,950 --> 03:21:43,010
Bro, when was the last time there was castle maintenance, guys?

5198
03:21:46,210 --> 03:21:47,610
Wait, I don't like that.

5199
03:21:47,950 --> 03:21:48,470
I don't like that.

5200
03:21:49,050 --> 03:21:49,890
People dying?

5201
03:22:14,070 --> 03:22:15,110
Okay, boot knife.

5202
03:22:15,250 --> 03:22:16,490
That's better than kitchen knife.

5203
03:22:18,570 --> 03:22:19,850
What the fuck?

5204
03:22:20,450 --> 03:22:23,190
Oh my god, what the fuck was that?

5205
03:22:24,090 --> 03:22:25,230
Oh, that's not good.

5206
03:22:25,310 --> 03:22:27,130
Now they're fucking upgraded now.

5207
03:22:27,630 --> 03:22:28,570
Oh no.

5208
03:22:30,190 --> 03:22:31,450
That is not good.

5209
03:22:31,710 --> 03:22:32,690
That is not good.

5210
03:22:32,730 --> 03:22:33,490
Don't let him get too close.

5211
03:22:33,630 --> 03:22:34,430
Well, that's great.

5212
03:22:34,490 --> 03:22:35,930
I have fucking Ashley with me.

5213
03:22:35,990 --> 03:22:38,390
I would love to not get too close when this bitch is here.

5214
03:22:42,750 --> 03:22:43,270
Boom.

5215
03:22:43,270 --> 03:22:43,790
Nice.

5216
03:22:44,450 --> 03:22:45,750
Got shotgun shells.

5217
03:22:47,030 --> 03:22:47,550
Okay.

5218
03:22:47,730 --> 03:22:50,490
Alright, we're gonna... that's the boss killer, right?

5219
03:22:50,950 --> 03:22:55,550
Okay, we're gonna put that shortcut... no, this shortcut...

5220
03:22:57,430 --> 03:22:58,650
There's a boss killer.

5221
03:22:58,950 --> 03:23:00,970
So, like, it should be over here.

5222
03:23:01,090 --> 03:23:02,530
And then we'll put this here.

5223
03:23:02,690 --> 03:23:03,250
There you go.

5224
03:23:05,930 --> 03:23:07,130
This is not good.

5225
03:23:09,090 --> 03:23:11,390
They're one... they were not one hit.

5226
03:23:13,270 --> 03:23:17,510
Did you not see how many fucking bullets it took?

5227
03:23:18,050 --> 03:23:20,170
That was not one hit.

5228
03:23:20,810 --> 03:23:22,330
What do you mean?

5229
03:23:23,550 --> 03:23:26,610
That was 100% not one hit.

5230
03:23:27,130 --> 03:23:27,990
Okay, sorry.

5231
03:23:28,070 --> 03:23:29,050
I had to make sure there was no door.

5232
03:23:29,830 --> 03:23:31,890
Oh, they can one hit me?

5233
03:23:32,810 --> 03:23:34,510
Oh, that's different.

5234
03:23:34,730 --> 03:23:36,330
That changes everything.

5235
03:23:38,030 --> 03:23:39,870
Wait, that actually changes everything.

5236
03:23:43,530 --> 03:23:48,750
Alright, let us... let us craft some more shotgun... I don't have enough shotgun.

5237
03:23:48,930 --> 03:23:49,530
Okay, nevermind.

5238
03:23:49,550 --> 03:23:50,130
Let's not craft.

5239
03:23:55,570 --> 03:23:56,130
Hello?

5240
03:23:57,590 --> 03:23:58,150
Hello?

5241
03:24:00,530 --> 03:24:01,870
Oh, I don't like that.

5242
03:24:02,010 --> 03:24:02,930
They're chanting something.

5243
03:24:04,090 --> 03:24:05,590
Wait, how did they see me?

5244
03:24:06,910 --> 03:24:07,470
What?

5245
03:24:08,850 --> 03:24:09,870
Is that Beau?

5246
03:24:11,750 --> 03:24:12,430
Oh, that is.

5247
03:24:16,760 --> 03:24:17,160
Okay.

5248
03:24:18,520 --> 03:24:19,780
I don't think they can hit that.

5249
03:24:21,920 --> 03:24:25,960
Guys, I don't think... oh, wait.

5250
03:24:26,100 --> 03:24:26,700
Don't worry.

5251
03:24:27,660 --> 03:24:29,160
I can use this as cover.

5252
03:24:33,010 --> 03:24:33,670
Where are they?

5253
03:24:35,810 --> 03:24:36,390
Where are they?

5254
03:24:36,430 --> 03:24:37,090
Come on, peek me.

5255
03:24:37,970 --> 03:24:38,570
Come on.

5256
03:24:42,430 --> 03:24:43,250
What the fuck?

5257
03:24:45,430 --> 03:24:46,670
That's bullshit.

5258
03:24:46,710 --> 03:24:47,810
I see you.

5259
03:24:51,190 --> 03:24:51,910
What?

5260
03:24:51,910 --> 03:24:53,230
What are you doing?

5261
03:24:54,670 --> 03:24:55,390
Whoa!

5262
03:24:55,410 --> 03:24:56,110
Whoa!

5263
03:24:56,110 --> 03:24:56,470
Whoa!

5264
03:24:57,030 --> 03:24:59,690
Ashley, please stay behind me.

5265
03:25:02,830 --> 03:25:04,230
This is bullshit.

5266
03:25:04,250 --> 03:25:05,530
The way they're hiding.

5267
03:25:05,550 --> 03:25:06,770
I hate this.

5268
03:25:08,110 --> 03:25:09,290
Look at them!

5269
03:25:09,490 --> 03:25:12,890
Look at the way they're hiding.

5270
03:25:12,890 --> 03:25:15,170
Look at these cowards.

5271
03:25:16,310 --> 03:25:17,270
There we go.

5272
03:25:19,510 --> 03:25:20,750
Like, you're gonna get shot.

5273
03:25:20,950 --> 03:25:22,450
You might as well just peek me.

5274
03:25:23,750 --> 03:25:24,570
There we go.

5275
03:25:25,470 --> 03:25:27,990
Like, you're gonna get shot regardless.

5276
03:25:31,310 --> 03:25:32,090
Alright, here.

5277
03:25:32,550 --> 03:25:34,690
We got the fucking gunpowder.

5278
03:25:36,070 --> 03:25:37,670
Like, just fucking peek me.

5279
03:25:40,690 --> 03:25:42,910
They're very stealthy.

5280
03:25:44,850 --> 03:25:48,670
Okay, that's not cool.

5281
03:25:49,470 --> 03:25:50,950
That is not cool.

5282
03:25:52,430 --> 03:25:54,290
That is not cool.

5283
03:25:54,490 --> 03:25:55,430
I like how it...

5284
03:25:55,430 --> 03:25:57,010
I get the cutscene after.

5285
03:26:00,570 --> 03:26:01,790
Yes, they do.

5286
03:26:04,630 --> 03:26:06,590
Where is it coming from?

5287
03:26:06,990 --> 03:26:07,650
Where is it coming from?

5288
03:26:12,270 --> 03:26:14,270
I don't know where the catapult is.

5289
03:26:17,310 --> 03:26:18,710
Like... Oh, it's over there.

5290
03:26:18,850 --> 03:26:19,210
Okay.

5291
03:26:19,330 --> 03:26:19,950
Ashley, please.

5292
03:26:20,110 --> 03:26:22,130
Please do not get catapulted.

5293
03:26:24,210 --> 03:26:26,470
That is my only dream, Ashley.

5294
03:26:28,890 --> 03:26:29,510
There we go.

5295
03:26:30,650 --> 03:26:32,770
I don't know how I saw it, but there it was.

5296
03:26:39,390 --> 03:26:40,470
Oh shit, wait.

5297
03:26:40,550 --> 03:26:41,610
There's more than one?

5298
03:26:42,690 --> 03:26:44,370
Wait, where's the other catapult?

5299
03:26:47,110 --> 03:26:52,610
Where the fuck is the other catapult?

5300
03:26:55,410 --> 03:26:56,690
Okay, I gotta make sure...

5301
03:26:57,350 --> 03:26:57,950
What?

5302
03:26:58,410 --> 03:27:00,190
Where did you come from?

5303
03:27:02,210 --> 03:27:02,810
Nigs.

5304
03:27:05,430 --> 03:27:06,450
I got your butt.

5305
03:27:08,190 --> 03:27:08,790
Nice.

5306
03:27:08,950 --> 03:27:11,570
Where the fuck did they come from?

5307
03:27:13,010 --> 03:27:14,630
Ashley, are you alright?

5308
03:27:14,830 --> 03:27:15,890
Yeah, thanks.

5309
03:27:17,050 --> 03:27:18,070
Oh Jesus.

5310
03:27:19,130 --> 03:27:20,530
Where's the next catapult?

5311
03:27:22,970 --> 03:27:26,290
I don't know where the next catapult is and that's the scary part.

5312
03:27:26,890 --> 03:27:27,490
No!

5313
03:27:29,150 --> 03:27:30,470
No, not over here!

5314
03:27:32,440 --> 03:27:35,140
Who should... Hey look, there's a gem.

5315
03:27:36,240 --> 03:27:38,640
Oh my god, it's over there.

5316
03:27:41,160 --> 03:27:42,340
There's no barrel!

5317
03:27:45,720 --> 03:27:48,120
How am I supposed to get it when there's no barrel?

5318
03:27:50,000 --> 03:27:50,820
Oh god.

5319
03:27:51,380 --> 03:27:52,160
Oh god.

5320
03:27:54,140 --> 03:27:55,440
Oh god, there's no barrel.

5321
03:27:55,920 --> 03:27:56,900
There's no barrel.

5322
03:27:57,000 --> 03:27:58,540
I don't know where it is.

5323
03:28:00,340 --> 03:28:01,900
Oh, what the... What?

5324
03:28:02,000 --> 03:28:02,280
Shit!

5325
03:28:03,460 --> 03:28:04,140
There you go.

5326
03:28:05,320 --> 03:28:06,900
No, stab, please don't turn.

5327
03:28:07,000 --> 03:28:08,020
You get one shot apparently.

5328
03:28:12,090 --> 03:28:14,730
Okay, I'm gonna see if I can see the barrel from here.

5329
03:28:14,730 --> 03:28:16,450
No, I'm not.

5330
03:28:16,570 --> 03:28:17,870
What do you mean?

5331
03:28:18,270 --> 03:28:19,730
I am not okay.

5332
03:28:22,630 --> 03:28:23,550
Oh god.

5333
03:28:24,530 --> 03:28:25,190
Oh god.

5334
03:28:25,670 --> 03:28:29,170
Oh god, it's blocking every... It's blocking everything.

5335
03:28:30,690 --> 03:28:31,810
Where do I go?

5336
03:28:31,910 --> 03:28:32,610
I'm so lost!

5337
03:28:33,530 --> 03:28:35,170
I'm so lost.

5338
03:28:38,430 --> 03:28:39,630
Oh my god.

5339
03:28:39,850 --> 03:28:41,630
Oh my god, where do we go?

5340
03:28:41,730 --> 03:28:43,210
There's so many areas!

5341
03:28:43,210 --> 03:28:44,970
Oh, there it is!

5342
03:28:45,050 --> 03:28:45,510
There it is!

5343
03:28:45,610 --> 03:28:45,830
Ashley!

5344
03:28:46,270 --> 03:28:47,470
Ashley, there it is!

5345
03:28:48,450 --> 03:28:48,890
Downstairs!

5346
03:28:53,380 --> 03:28:53,820
Okay.

5347
03:28:55,540 --> 03:28:55,980
Okay.

5348
03:28:56,960 --> 03:28:58,180
Okay, I don't know where to go.

5349
03:28:58,300 --> 03:28:59,400
I'm just gonna stay back here.

5350
03:28:59,560 --> 03:29:00,460
This is the beginning.

5351
03:29:00,940 --> 03:29:01,800
This is the...

5352
03:29:01,800 --> 03:29:05,360
I went the wrong way, Ashley.

5353
03:29:05,680 --> 03:29:07,460
I went the wrong way.

5354
03:29:07,680 --> 03:29:08,820
I went backwards.

5355
03:29:09,960 --> 03:29:11,080
Ashley, I'm sorry.

5356
03:29:11,200 --> 03:29:11,960
I went backwards.

5357
03:29:12,080 --> 03:29:12,900
I'm so lost.

5358
03:29:12,900 --> 03:29:15,760
Ashley, I don't know where is left and right.

5359
03:29:16,120 --> 03:29:16,620
Ashley!

5360
03:29:17,300 --> 03:29:18,520
Wait, I can craft though.

5361
03:29:18,820 --> 03:29:20,380
What do I need though?

5362
03:29:20,540 --> 03:29:21,200
Do I need a rifle?

5363
03:29:21,800 --> 03:29:22,920
Ashley, give me a sec.

5364
03:29:23,240 --> 03:29:25,560
Uncle Leon is trying to figure out ammo management.

5365
03:29:30,060 --> 03:29:33,300
Uncle Leon needs to work on his ammo situation.

5366
03:29:34,200 --> 03:29:35,020
Is it here?

5367
03:29:36,780 --> 03:29:37,280
No!

5368
03:29:38,220 --> 03:29:39,220
It's locked!

5369
03:29:42,900 --> 03:29:43,700
Oh my god, Ashley!

5370
03:29:44,500 --> 03:29:45,580
There's a barrel down!

5371
03:29:45,700 --> 03:29:45,940
Look!

5372
03:29:47,440 --> 03:29:47,920
Nice.

5373
03:29:48,340 --> 03:29:48,820
Okay.

5374
03:29:49,260 --> 03:29:49,740
Okay.

5375
03:29:50,820 --> 03:29:53,000
Okay, I need to figure this out again.

5376
03:29:54,060 --> 03:29:56,380
Okay, Uncle Leon doesn't know what to do.

5377
03:29:56,460 --> 03:29:58,440
Uncle Leon is so fucked up right now.

5378
03:30:02,310 --> 03:30:02,790
Oh!

5379
03:30:02,910 --> 03:30:03,870
Oh, there, there, there, there!

5380
03:30:05,750 --> 03:30:06,430
Here we go.

5381
03:30:06,810 --> 03:30:08,310
I figured it out, guys.

5382
03:30:08,570 --> 03:30:09,710
I'm not that stupid.

5383
03:30:10,550 --> 03:30:11,450
This could work.

5384
03:30:14,370 --> 03:30:14,690
Okay, what's this?

5385
03:30:16,310 --> 03:30:18,070
Oh, I can shoot the cannon!

5386
03:30:20,910 --> 03:30:22,310
Oh my god.

5387
03:30:23,470 --> 03:30:24,950
This could definitely work.

5388
03:30:25,730 --> 03:30:26,550
I like that.

5389
03:30:27,770 --> 03:30:30,590
Okay, I'm gonna bring out the shotgun just in case I get like shocked again.

5390
03:30:33,470 --> 03:30:36,030
Please, why are there no lockers in this castle?

5391
03:30:40,650 --> 03:30:43,430
Where are my lockers in this castle?

5392
03:30:43,950 --> 03:30:45,490
How do I get out of here?

5393
03:30:46,310 --> 03:30:47,830
Uncle Leon is lost again.

5394
03:30:52,150 --> 03:30:54,450
Was there an exit here?

5395
03:30:54,630 --> 03:30:55,410
The accident...

5396
03:30:55,410 --> 03:30:56,630
Oh, there was a ladder!

5397
03:30:57,450 --> 03:30:58,830
It's painted yellow!

5398
03:30:59,650 --> 03:31:01,150
I should have known.

5399
03:31:01,610 --> 03:31:04,430
I should have known the yellow paint strap.

5400
03:31:06,090 --> 03:31:08,990
I always forget about the paint strap.

5401
03:31:09,490 --> 03:31:10,850
The barrels though.

5402
03:31:13,170 --> 03:31:14,350
Why is there so...

5403
03:31:14,350 --> 03:31:15,850
Wait, I could have shot this!

5404
03:31:17,070 --> 03:31:20,910
Oh my god, they were there this entire time looking at me.

5405
03:31:20,990 --> 03:31:22,670
Wait, where's Ashley?

5406
03:31:24,030 --> 03:31:24,610
Ow!

5407
03:31:26,230 --> 03:31:26,810
What?

5408
03:31:28,650 --> 03:31:29,230
How?

5409
03:31:29,550 --> 03:31:31,410
How did you get injured?

5410
03:31:31,430 --> 03:31:33,150
How did you get injured?

5411
03:31:35,370 --> 03:31:37,090
Okay, this is awkward.

5412
03:31:37,530 --> 03:31:38,490
Okay, this is awkward.

5413
03:31:38,490 --> 03:31:41,590
Alright, let's just hope no fucking catapult kills her.

5414
03:31:41,850 --> 03:31:44,090
Like, this is all I'm betting on.

5415
03:31:44,210 --> 03:31:45,250
Wait a minute.

5416
03:31:45,250 --> 03:31:46,490
Where did you come from?

5417
03:31:49,750 --> 03:31:53,930
I'm going all in with the catapult not fucking me up.

5418
03:31:57,750 --> 03:31:59,030
Wait, what the fuck?

5419
03:32:00,470 --> 03:32:01,350
Oh shit.

5420
03:32:07,890 --> 03:32:08,930
Oh, she's okay.

5421
03:32:09,050 --> 03:32:09,430
That's good.

5422
03:32:10,150 --> 03:32:11,230
That's all that matters.

5423
03:32:13,570 --> 03:32:14,350
She's okay.

5424
03:32:15,110 --> 03:32:16,350
She's okay, guys.

5425
03:32:17,530 --> 03:32:18,390
There we go.

5426
03:32:18,390 --> 03:32:20,410
Alright, we're okay.

5427
03:32:20,690 --> 03:32:21,560
We're okay.

5428
03:32:23,810 --> 03:32:25,130
Holy fuck.

5429
03:32:26,130 --> 03:32:26,790
How?

5430
03:32:27,310 --> 03:32:27,870
How?

5431
03:32:28,470 --> 03:32:28,750
Awesome.

5432
03:32:29,350 --> 03:32:30,690
Oh my god.

5433
03:32:30,850 --> 03:32:31,290
Bro!

5434
03:32:33,180 --> 03:32:34,190
Oh my god.

5435
03:32:34,230 --> 03:32:34,610
Okay.

5436
03:32:34,890 --> 03:32:36,510
Guys, it had to be done.

5437
03:32:39,100 --> 03:32:40,190
Okay, here we go.

5438
03:32:42,120 --> 03:32:43,690
Alright, we need...

5439
03:32:44,410 --> 03:32:45,650
Couple of...

5440
03:32:45,650 --> 03:32:47,170
We need like two more blues.

5441
03:32:47,730 --> 03:32:48,830
Where's another blue?

5442
03:32:48,930 --> 03:32:51,030
I swear to god there were more blues somewhere.

5443
03:32:52,370 --> 03:32:52,830
Swear.

5444
03:32:53,910 --> 03:32:55,670
Swear I saw a lot of them.

5445
03:32:57,510 --> 03:32:58,250
The gate?

5446
03:32:59,050 --> 03:33:00,150
Oh, is that the gate?

5447
03:33:03,650 --> 03:33:04,590
No, there wasn't.

5448
03:33:05,090 --> 03:33:05,550
Liars.

5449
03:33:06,950 --> 03:33:08,010
There's no blues here.

5450
03:33:08,550 --> 03:33:09,950
Oh, there's a blue here though.

5451
03:33:12,370 --> 03:33:13,010
There we go.

5452
03:33:13,030 --> 03:33:13,610
We need two more.

5453
03:33:16,230 --> 03:33:17,190
Oh, yeah.

5454
03:33:17,270 --> 03:33:18,470
No, it doesn't have it.

5455
03:33:19,290 --> 03:33:20,070
This map...

5456
03:33:20,070 --> 03:33:21,110
We didn't pick up the...

5457
03:33:21,930 --> 03:33:24,110
We didn't pick up the quest yet for this.

5458
03:33:26,930 --> 03:33:29,150
We'll hit the gate with the cannon later.

5459
03:33:29,370 --> 03:33:30,990
We gotta do the side quest.

5460
03:33:31,570 --> 03:33:34,190
This side quest is more important.

5461
03:33:37,610 --> 03:33:39,010
Guys, no, no, no.

5462
03:33:39,070 --> 03:33:40,070
We have to...

5463
03:33:41,370 --> 03:33:44,510
There's two more that we need to do.

5464
03:33:45,030 --> 03:33:48,230
This side quest is the most important thing right now.

5465
03:33:50,950 --> 03:33:52,570
Is there anything in here?

5466
03:33:53,270 --> 03:33:54,730
Maybe I'll look down here.

5467
03:33:55,310 --> 03:33:56,990
I'm gonna double check if there's...

5468
03:33:56,990 --> 03:33:57,690
Oh, there it is.

5469
03:33:57,730 --> 03:33:58,250
There's one here.

5470
03:33:58,310 --> 03:33:58,590
Nice.

5471
03:34:01,170 --> 03:34:02,310
Yeah, there's one here.

5472
03:34:02,690 --> 03:34:04,310
Okay, we're missing one more.

5473
03:34:06,810 --> 03:34:08,430
We're missing one last blue.

5474
03:34:09,130 --> 03:34:10,690
There's one below on a tree.

5475
03:34:10,750 --> 03:34:11,690
There's so many trees.

5476
03:34:12,430 --> 03:34:13,850
We're literally in a forest.

5477
03:34:14,690 --> 03:34:16,410
This castle is in the forest.

5478
03:34:16,490 --> 03:34:17,470
Which tree?

5479
03:34:20,930 --> 03:34:21,890
Oh, I didn't see this.

5480
03:34:21,970 --> 03:34:23,090
I was so fucking panicking.

5481
03:34:23,130 --> 03:34:24,250
I didn't see all these boxes.

5482
03:34:25,670 --> 03:34:26,030
Nice.

5483
03:34:30,440 --> 03:34:30,980
All right.

5484
03:34:31,040 --> 03:34:31,460
Oh, wait.

5485
03:34:31,520 --> 03:34:32,180
I didn't see this too.

5486
03:34:33,620 --> 03:34:34,260
Oh, my God.

5487
03:34:34,280 --> 03:34:35,220
The elegant bangle.

5488
03:34:38,600 --> 03:34:39,420
Oh, my God.

5489
03:34:39,460 --> 03:34:40,360
There's so much loot.

5490
03:34:40,360 --> 03:34:42,320
The green tree.

5491
03:34:44,040 --> 03:34:45,920
It's over there, Doki.

5492
03:34:46,020 --> 03:34:47,560
That tree right there.

5493
03:34:48,100 --> 03:34:49,560
Doki, it's right there.

5494
03:34:49,940 --> 03:34:51,600
Doki, that tree.

5495
03:34:53,300 --> 03:34:54,780
God, it's over here.

5496
03:34:57,120 --> 03:34:58,580
The greener tree.

5497
03:34:58,760 --> 03:34:59,920
You know, that one.

5498
03:35:00,500 --> 03:35:02,520
Yeah, that tree over there.

5499
03:35:05,500 --> 03:35:06,860
Trees by the merchant.

5500
03:35:07,040 --> 03:35:07,880
Oh, it's by the...

5501
03:35:07,880 --> 03:35:08,280
You know what?

5502
03:35:08,300 --> 03:35:08,920
You could have said that.

5503
03:35:09,300 --> 03:35:10,340
You could have said that.

5504
03:35:10,360 --> 03:35:12,280
You could have just said tree by the merchant.

5505
03:35:13,360 --> 03:35:13,840
Boom.

5506
03:35:18,110 --> 03:35:19,210
Oh, I see the request.

5507
03:35:23,530 --> 03:35:25,350
The request is right there.

5508
03:35:29,130 --> 03:35:29,610
Okay.

5509
03:35:30,210 --> 03:35:31,130
Wait, my bad.

5510
03:35:31,210 --> 03:35:32,130
It's the other tree.

5511
03:35:33,890 --> 03:35:34,370
Sorry.

5512
03:35:34,550 --> 03:35:35,050
My bad.

5513
03:35:35,150 --> 03:35:35,950
I meant that tree.

5514
03:35:36,970 --> 03:35:37,450
Yeah?

5515
03:35:37,570 --> 03:35:38,050
Tree?

5516
03:35:38,470 --> 03:35:40,570
There's no trees in the fucking castle, guys.

5517
03:35:41,890 --> 03:35:42,370
Oh.

5518
03:35:43,670 --> 03:35:43,950
Boom.

5519
03:35:44,950 --> 03:35:45,510
Boom.

5520
03:35:47,830 --> 03:35:48,630
All right.

5521
03:35:48,750 --> 03:35:49,570
Here we go.

5522
03:35:49,870 --> 03:35:51,570
Now we have the request.

5523
03:35:52,290 --> 03:35:53,590
It's right here?

5524
03:35:53,870 --> 03:35:54,610
Where is there?

5525
03:35:56,690 --> 03:35:57,250
Okay.

5526
03:35:57,430 --> 03:35:58,830
Actually this is important.

5527
03:35:59,510 --> 03:36:01,990
Uncle Leon needs to get the medallions.

5528
03:36:02,030 --> 03:36:04,870
Because uncle Leon needs fucking upgrades.

5529
03:36:07,650 --> 03:36:09,670
You don't let Uncle Leon do this.

5530
03:36:09,750 --> 03:36:10,690
You don't love him.

5531
03:36:12,530 --> 03:36:14,270
How do you get downstairs again?

5532
03:36:14,450 --> 03:36:14,910
Oh, this way.

5533
03:36:18,090 --> 03:36:18,730
Okay.

5534
03:36:18,730 --> 03:36:20,930
We need to grab that tree.

5535
03:36:22,650 --> 03:36:24,650
That's apparently over here.

5536
03:36:25,270 --> 03:36:28,050
Thank god Leon doesn't have stamina bars.

5537
03:36:28,790 --> 03:36:30,450
Thank fucking god.

5538
03:36:31,890 --> 03:36:33,090
Where is it?

5539
03:36:34,210 --> 03:36:35,670
Where is this tree?

5540
03:36:37,690 --> 03:36:39,130
Oh, there it is.

5541
03:36:39,210 --> 03:36:39,890
I see it.

5542
03:36:39,930 --> 03:36:41,170
It's that tree right here.

5543
03:36:41,730 --> 03:36:42,490
There we go.

5544
03:36:45,910 --> 03:36:47,930
It was that tree all along.

5545
03:36:50,710 --> 03:36:51,550
Okay, reload.

5546
03:36:52,050 --> 03:36:53,910
I gotta make more shock enamel later.

5547
03:36:56,150 --> 03:36:56,670
Nice.

5548
03:36:57,030 --> 03:36:57,550
Reload.

5549
03:36:58,430 --> 03:36:59,770
Alright, we're good to go.

5550
03:37:01,250 --> 03:37:03,270
Alright Ashley, we're going in!

5551
03:37:03,430 --> 03:37:03,790
Yeah!

5552
03:37:08,370 --> 03:37:09,250
Open sesame!

5553
03:37:16,320 --> 03:37:17,300
You have stuff?

5554
03:37:18,640 --> 03:37:19,160
Sell it!

5555
03:37:19,660 --> 03:37:20,540
I did it!

5556
03:37:22,240 --> 03:37:22,680
Okay.

5557
03:37:22,760 --> 03:37:24,860
Do you have the box upgrade?

5558
03:37:25,020 --> 03:37:25,720
No, he doesn't.

5559
03:37:26,400 --> 03:37:28,640
Okay, I need a... what the fuck?

5560
03:37:28,680 --> 03:37:29,000
Oh yeah.

5561
03:37:29,380 --> 03:37:30,340
I can sell that.

5562
03:37:31,020 --> 03:37:32,160
I can sell this.

5563
03:37:33,180 --> 03:37:34,420
Do I have two circles?

5564
03:37:34,720 --> 03:37:35,560
No, I don't.

5565
03:37:35,560 --> 03:37:36,680
I don't have two circles yet.

5566
03:37:36,680 --> 03:37:37,720
So I'll just sell these for now.

5567
03:37:37,860 --> 03:37:38,300
I'm gonna sell this.

5568
03:37:39,560 --> 03:37:40,360
Sell time!

5569
03:37:42,180 --> 03:37:42,780
Save.

5570
03:37:44,760 --> 03:37:45,360
Nice.

5571
03:37:45,640 --> 03:37:47,000
Alright Ashley, here we go.

5572
03:37:48,740 --> 03:37:53,560
We're about to be at the part where I have to play as you and that's gonna be the worst part.

5573
03:37:54,700 --> 03:37:55,300
Hello?

5574
03:37:56,580 --> 03:37:57,640
Adam Sandler?

5575
03:37:58,080 --> 03:37:58,400
Adam Sandler?

5576
03:37:58,400 --> 03:37:59,100
Adam Sandler?

5577
03:38:00,880 --> 03:38:02,320
Adam Sandler?

5578
03:38:02,880 --> 03:38:05,960
Adam Sandler?

5579
03:38:05,960 --> 03:38:06,960
Please, little boy!

5580
03:38:08,340 --> 03:38:09,600
Mr. Kennedy.

5581
03:38:10,400 --> 03:38:12,700
Who the hell are you?

5582
03:38:12,900 --> 03:38:13,400
Me?

5583
03:38:13,620 --> 03:38:16,180
Oh please, call me Ramon.

5584
03:38:16,700 --> 03:38:19,600
And allow me to get straight to the point.

5585
03:38:20,540 --> 03:38:24,940
I would like you to hand the girl there over to me.

5586
03:38:25,800 --> 03:38:26,480
Now.

5587
03:38:27,020 --> 03:38:29,180
You have that chance, Ramon.

5588
03:38:29,220 --> 03:38:30,820
He has a Benjamin Button disease.

5589
03:38:31,400 --> 03:38:32,020
With me.

5590
03:38:34,040 --> 03:38:35,400
Mr. Kennedy.

5591
03:38:35,960 --> 03:38:37,320
There's no- he's 20?

5592
03:38:37,680 --> 03:38:38,620
Holy shit.

5593
03:38:38,780 --> 03:38:39,240
What happened?

5594
03:38:39,520 --> 03:38:42,540
This man was stressed way too hard.

5595
03:39:05,960 --> 03:39:06,500
Yes?

5596
03:39:08,000 --> 03:39:08,680
Never!

5597
03:39:09,700 --> 03:39:10,720
You are the lady.

5598
03:39:11,140 --> 03:39:12,820
I was fortunate.

5599
03:39:13,020 --> 03:39:13,800
I just love it.

5600
03:39:14,200 --> 03:39:16,280
Her fucking outfit.

5601
03:39:16,620 --> 03:39:17,360
You make Sarah Fierce feel so cool.

5602
03:39:17,700 --> 03:39:19,800
Now that he has chosen death.

5603
03:39:27,220 --> 03:39:29,680
Look, Netflix was just not as lucrative.

5604
03:39:30,060 --> 03:39:30,740
Okay?

5605
03:39:30,900 --> 03:39:32,900
The Netflix deal ran out.

5606
03:39:33,940 --> 03:39:35,160
Oh my god.

5607
03:39:35,240 --> 03:39:36,220
Excuse me?

5608
03:39:36,480 --> 03:39:37,580
That was a lot.

5609
03:39:41,310 --> 03:39:42,150
Oh god.

5610
03:39:42,270 --> 03:39:43,270
Stay close to me.

5611
03:39:43,530 --> 03:39:44,910
Stay close to me.

5612
03:39:46,350 --> 03:39:47,350
Stay close!

5613
03:39:48,010 --> 03:39:48,610
Wait!

5614
03:39:48,790 --> 03:39:49,050
No!

5615
03:39:53,360 --> 03:39:53,960
Okay.

5616
03:39:53,960 --> 03:39:54,820
Reload time.

5617
03:39:55,040 --> 03:39:55,800
Reload time.

5618
03:39:56,040 --> 03:39:56,880
Reload time.

5619
03:39:57,020 --> 03:39:59,760
I swear to god, do not get hit, Ashley!

5620
03:40:00,620 --> 03:40:02,300
That is my only demand!

5621
03:40:08,260 --> 03:40:08,860
Oh!

5622
03:40:08,960 --> 03:40:10,240
I missed every shot!

5623
03:40:13,740 --> 03:40:18,460
That was aw- That was aw- Okay.

5624
03:40:18,700 --> 03:40:20,640
That was a little awkward there.

5625
03:40:20,720 --> 03:40:22,280
That I sort of missed every shot.

5626
03:40:23,580 --> 03:40:25,840
It's a little awkward.

5627
03:40:30,080 --> 03:40:30,600
Alright.

5628
03:40:30,600 --> 03:40:31,360
It's okay.

5629
03:40:31,520 --> 03:40:31,940
It's okay.

5630
03:40:32,040 --> 03:40:33,020
Everything is fine.

5631
03:40:33,560 --> 03:40:34,400
We survived!

5632
03:40:35,180 --> 03:40:36,160
We are survivors!

5633
03:40:39,220 --> 03:40:41,260
There is like so much loot upstairs.

5634
03:40:41,800 --> 03:40:42,580
God damn it.

5635
03:40:42,600 --> 03:40:43,100
It's in the chest.

5636
03:40:43,840 --> 03:40:44,360
Okay.

5637
03:40:44,420 --> 03:40:45,360
I will just smash some jars.

5638
03:40:47,800 --> 03:40:48,440
It's not my home.

5639
03:40:48,740 --> 03:40:49,720
Not my home.

5640
03:40:50,340 --> 03:40:50,860
Smashy!

5641
03:40:51,480 --> 03:40:52,080
Smashy smash!

5642
03:40:53,060 --> 03:40:53,920
What is this?

5643
03:40:54,120 --> 03:40:54,800
God, I don't have anything.

5644
03:40:55,960 --> 03:40:57,460
Why is it so foggy?

5645
03:40:57,520 --> 03:40:59,520
Did someone put like some fog machine in here?

5646
03:40:59,960 --> 03:41:00,660
Wait, Merchant.

5647
03:41:00,720 --> 03:41:02,160
You just watched this happen?

5648
03:41:05,600 --> 03:41:06,380
Oh shit!

5649
03:41:06,440 --> 03:41:09,680
There was a fucking bat like fucking two meters away from you, sir!

5650
03:41:11,120 --> 03:41:11,640
Bro!

5651
03:41:12,140 --> 03:41:13,940
The most evil guy.

5652
03:41:14,200 --> 03:41:15,500
Ramen salad pie.

5653
03:41:15,500 --> 03:41:17,560
Yoshi, thank you for the super chat.

5654
03:41:17,680 --> 03:41:17,960
Thank you.

5655
03:41:18,180 --> 03:41:18,700
Thank you.

5656
03:41:19,680 --> 03:41:20,080
Okay.

5657
03:41:20,240 --> 03:41:22,120
There is like nothing I need to do here.

5658
03:41:22,360 --> 03:41:23,300
I'm just gonna save.

5659
03:41:26,840 --> 03:41:27,240
Alright.

5660
03:41:27,260 --> 03:41:27,460
Here.

5661
03:41:31,060 --> 03:41:31,860
Merch just...

5662
03:41:31,860 --> 03:41:32,900
The merchant...

5663
03:41:32,900 --> 03:41:35,220
If it's not gold, it doesn't matter.

5664
03:41:36,920 --> 03:41:37,940
Can I open this door?

5665
03:41:38,500 --> 03:41:40,080
How would I be able to go in?

5666
03:41:41,520 --> 03:41:43,300
Oh, I have to drop down from there.

5667
03:41:44,000 --> 03:41:44,400
Okay.

5668
03:41:45,000 --> 03:41:48,160
There's so much loot, but I cannot get any of it.

5669
03:41:48,880 --> 03:41:50,040
Gap in the wall.

5670
03:41:53,040 --> 03:41:54,580
Oh, Ashley, go in.

5671
03:41:54,680 --> 03:41:55,920
This is your only job.

5672
03:41:56,140 --> 03:41:58,260
I don't ask for much, Ashley.

5673
03:42:00,440 --> 03:42:03,140
Ashley, I ask for almost nothing.

5674
03:42:05,140 --> 03:42:05,700
Please.

5675
03:42:08,280 --> 03:42:10,880
This is the only time I ask for anything.

5676
03:42:12,940 --> 03:42:13,700
It's open.

5677
03:42:13,880 --> 03:42:14,300
Okay.

5678
03:42:14,400 --> 03:42:14,720
There you are.

5679
03:42:14,920 --> 03:42:15,120
Nice.

5680
03:42:16,640 --> 03:42:17,900
Thank God you're useful.

5681
03:42:18,920 --> 03:42:20,060
Thank fucking God.

5682
03:42:23,580 --> 03:42:25,160
Ashley, I don't ask for much.

5683
03:42:25,340 --> 03:42:25,600
Oh, okay.

5684
03:42:25,640 --> 03:42:27,440
I thought I had to like make her go through this too.

5685
03:42:29,720 --> 03:42:31,420
Look for another way.

5686
03:42:32,280 --> 03:42:32,960
Oh, is this?

5687
03:42:33,080 --> 03:42:33,840
Oh, okay.

5688
03:42:33,920 --> 03:42:34,280
It was not...

5689
03:42:34,280 --> 03:42:34,820
Ashley, go back.

5690
03:42:35,820 --> 03:42:36,660
Ashley, go back.

5691
03:42:37,740 --> 03:42:38,560
Ashley, go back.

5692
03:42:38,960 --> 03:42:42,140
I didn't realize this was where I was supposed to go.

5693
03:42:42,200 --> 03:42:42,880
I have to still loot.

5694
03:42:44,400 --> 03:42:46,100
Ashley, looting is still important here.

5695
03:42:49,880 --> 03:42:50,400
Okay.

5696
03:42:50,460 --> 03:42:51,500
There is a chest.

5697
03:42:53,460 --> 03:42:55,460
Oh, elegant perfume bottle.

5698
03:42:55,800 --> 03:42:57,060
Something I can sell.

5699
03:42:58,780 --> 03:42:59,300
Okay.

5700
03:43:01,080 --> 03:43:01,940
Let's see.

5701
03:43:03,500 --> 03:43:05,540
That is the door where I can't open.

5702
03:43:05,720 --> 03:43:06,200
Knock, knock.

5703
03:43:07,380 --> 03:43:08,080
Knock, knock.

5704
03:43:08,140 --> 03:43:08,500
I'm alive.

5705
03:43:10,220 --> 03:43:10,740
Okay.

5706
03:43:10,860 --> 03:43:12,960
We're going to save again because...

5707
03:43:14,280 --> 03:43:16,220
Because like, you know, every time you make a mistake, you're going to get a kill.

5708
03:43:16,220 --> 03:43:17,220
You're going to make a little bit of progress.

5709
03:43:17,380 --> 03:43:18,720
You got to save so you don't want to...

5710
03:43:18,720 --> 03:43:21,760
This is efficiency because what happens if I fucking just die?

5711
03:43:23,120 --> 03:43:25,100
Because I don't want to do this again.

5712
03:43:27,320 --> 03:43:30,580
Every time you make a little bit of progress, you have to save.

5713
03:43:31,600 --> 03:43:33,020
So you don't have to...

5714
03:43:33,020 --> 03:43:35,060
That's why I have 51 saves.

5715
03:43:39,820 --> 03:43:44,380
This is exactly why we have 51 saves, guys.

5716
03:43:44,940 --> 03:43:46,200
It's just efficiency.

5717
03:43:51,440 --> 03:43:53,200
Because what if I just die?

5718
03:43:54,800 --> 03:43:55,580
With me.

5719
03:43:56,340 --> 03:43:56,780
Okay.

5720
03:44:01,020 --> 03:44:01,900
I just...

5721
03:44:03,320 --> 03:44:03,760
Okay.

5722
03:44:04,720 --> 03:44:05,160
Nice.

5723
03:44:05,200 --> 03:44:05,500
Okay.

5724
03:44:05,600 --> 03:44:06,480
It's made of wood.

5725
03:44:06,660 --> 03:44:07,740
So I can...

5726
03:44:09,160 --> 03:44:10,420
I like how it's just that.

5727
03:44:10,660 --> 03:44:11,380
Is there nothing else?

5728
03:44:15,960 --> 03:44:17,000
I hear something.

5729
03:44:18,360 --> 03:44:19,480
Oh, it's above me.

5730
03:44:19,820 --> 03:44:20,260
Okay.

5731
03:44:20,320 --> 03:44:20,840
I knew it.

5732
03:44:21,100 --> 03:44:22,500
I was like, I hear it.

5733
03:44:24,080 --> 03:44:24,600
Okay.

5734
03:44:24,660 --> 03:44:25,460
Let's see.

5735
03:44:26,000 --> 03:44:27,440
I knew I heard something.

5736
03:44:31,000 --> 03:44:31,520
Wait.

5737
03:44:31,660 --> 03:44:32,500
What's that treasure?

5738
03:44:32,700 --> 03:44:33,360
Is it not...

5739
03:44:33,360 --> 03:44:34,140
It must be above.

5740
03:44:34,600 --> 03:44:36,620
It must be above because I can't get it.

5741
03:44:36,640 --> 03:44:37,660
Looks like we can continue on this way.

5742
03:44:38,000 --> 03:44:39,120
Oh my god.

5743
03:44:40,260 --> 03:44:41,360
God damn it.

5744
03:44:41,400 --> 03:44:41,820
It's dark.

5745
03:44:42,640 --> 03:44:43,680
I hate it.

5746
03:44:43,800 --> 03:44:44,480
I hate it.

5747
03:44:44,880 --> 03:44:45,920
I hate this.

5748
03:44:46,500 --> 03:44:47,940
I fucking hate this.

5749
03:44:48,520 --> 03:44:49,040
Okay.

5750
03:44:49,080 --> 03:44:49,880
He's definitely dead.

5751
03:44:50,980 --> 03:44:51,800
Oh no.

5752
03:44:51,800 --> 03:44:51,880
No.

5753
03:44:51,880 --> 03:44:53,040
This is a torture room.

5754
03:44:53,580 --> 03:44:54,700
Is there any...

5755
03:44:54,700 --> 03:44:55,740
Oh my gosh.

5756
03:44:55,840 --> 03:44:56,040
No.

5757
03:44:56,700 --> 03:44:58,140
I hate this.

5758
03:44:58,640 --> 03:45:00,300
I hate this so much.

5759
03:45:00,640 --> 03:45:01,760
I hate this.

5760
03:45:02,020 --> 03:45:02,840
I hate this.

5761
03:45:03,960 --> 03:45:05,000
Can you move?

5762
03:45:06,900 --> 03:45:10,480
Can I not just like untie him and like fucking move?

5763
03:45:11,340 --> 03:45:15,060
I was awoken in the middle of the night once again.

5764
03:45:16,000 --> 03:45:19,700
It's those awful noises coming from the basement.

5765
03:45:19,700 --> 03:45:25,840
The sounds of nails clawing at the stone walls and the writhing moan of curses.

5766
03:45:26,480 --> 03:45:30,920
That man harbors enough hate to ruin this world.

5767
03:45:31,360 --> 03:45:37,740
He once served the lord of the castle as a torturer, like his father and grandfather before him.

5768
03:45:38,320 --> 03:45:43,040
It's one of the most unsightly legacies left by the Salazar family.

5769
03:45:43,800 --> 03:45:46,660
Even among his family, he was special.

5770
03:45:46,660 --> 03:45:50,680
He enjoyed his work wholeheartedly and had a talent for it.

5771
03:45:50,780 --> 03:45:52,960
He was gifted at tormenting others.

5772
03:45:53,720 --> 03:45:56,340
His ability soon attracted the master's interest.

5773
03:45:56,620 --> 03:45:58,740
And when he took him to the dungeon...

5774
03:45:58,740 --> 03:46:00,480
No, I can't write anymore.

5775
03:46:00,840 --> 03:46:01,960
I won't.

5776
03:46:03,040 --> 03:46:05,840
I don't want to recall what happened down there.

5777
03:46:07,540 --> 03:46:09,520
My mind can't take it.

5778
03:46:09,580 --> 03:46:10,960
It will break me.

5779
03:46:11,400 --> 03:46:15,240
I was ordered to attend him, to feed him, dispose of the fifth.

5780
03:46:15,580 --> 03:46:16,640
All while living.

5781
03:46:16,660 --> 03:46:18,860
Listening to that wretched voice every night.

5782
03:46:19,510 --> 03:46:20,980
I can't take it anymore.

5783
03:46:21,240 --> 03:46:22,280
I've had enough.

5784
03:46:22,740 --> 03:46:25,600
I'll not tolerate one more night in this castle.

5785
03:46:26,050 --> 03:46:27,240
I shall leave tomorrow.

5786
03:46:27,910 --> 03:46:31,920
Go far away, where that voice cannot reach my ears.

5787
03:46:32,000 --> 03:46:32,400
Damn.

5788
03:46:33,330 --> 03:46:35,540
Bro, your voice was shit.

5789
03:46:36,980 --> 03:46:39,020
Definitely won't be doing any ASMR.

5790
03:46:39,760 --> 03:46:41,140
None shall escape.

5791
03:46:42,880 --> 03:46:44,180
Okay, Salazar?

5792
03:46:44,480 --> 03:46:45,840
Like that little guy?

5793
03:46:46,000 --> 03:46:46,540
I assume...

5794
03:46:46,540 --> 03:46:47,840
I assume the little guy is Salazar.

5795
03:46:48,400 --> 03:46:49,320
And like...

5796
03:46:49,320 --> 03:46:52,600
Like his voice reminds me of an actor.

5797
03:46:53,080 --> 03:46:54,380
Like, I swear.

5798
03:46:55,280 --> 03:46:57,920
Like, it looks just like him too.

5799
03:46:58,180 --> 03:47:01,740
Like some old-timey actor from a long time ago.

5800
03:47:01,840 --> 03:47:02,780
Oh, hey, the Iron Maiden.

5801
03:47:03,840 --> 03:47:05,820
I'm trying to like remember who.

5802
03:47:06,060 --> 03:47:08,220
Like his whole voice too.

5803
03:47:08,520 --> 03:47:09,360
What was that?

5804
03:47:10,080 --> 03:47:11,740
I was having a satchel dog.

5805
03:47:15,880 --> 03:47:18,160
No, like there was an actor like that.

5806
03:47:18,480 --> 03:47:20,000
It sounds and looks just like him.

5807
03:47:20,460 --> 03:47:22,040
I can't remember who.

5808
03:47:27,420 --> 03:47:28,680
Don't worry, I have my shotgun.

5809
03:47:29,720 --> 03:47:31,340
Don't worry, don't worry, Ashley.

5810
03:47:32,860 --> 03:47:34,680
I have my shotgun, Ashley.

5811
03:47:35,700 --> 03:47:39,100
Don't worry, something's going to come in here.

5812
03:47:41,060 --> 03:47:41,880
Don't worry.

5813
03:47:43,880 --> 03:47:45,360
Something's going to come in here.

5814
03:47:45,500 --> 03:47:45,840
Hehe.

5815
03:47:49,440 --> 03:47:50,560
The time...

5816
03:47:50,560 --> 03:47:51,640
The light is lost.

5817
03:47:53,340 --> 03:47:54,580
I fucking knew it!

5818
03:47:54,620 --> 03:47:55,400
I fucking knew it!

5819
03:47:59,120 --> 03:48:00,440
It's okay, I have the shotgun!

5820
03:48:05,550 --> 03:48:07,970
Oh, where would the shotgun go?

5821
03:48:10,450 --> 03:48:12,070
Which pattern is better?

5822
03:48:16,070 --> 03:48:17,310
Can I just kill him?

5823
03:48:21,300 --> 03:48:23,160
Okay, guys, can I just kill him?

5824
03:48:31,620 --> 03:48:33,500
Is this... yeah?

5825
03:48:34,910 --> 03:48:35,320
Try!

5826
03:48:39,370 --> 03:48:39,780
Why?

5827
03:48:41,340 --> 03:48:42,160
Tell

5828
03:48:51,020 --> 03:48:52,360
me to shoot him!

5829
03:49:01,030 --> 03:49:04,210
Why didn't you tell me to shoot him?

5830
03:49:07,730 --> 03:49:09,730
Okay, okay, I have a grenade.

5831
03:49:10,910 --> 03:49:11,730
Boom!

5832
03:49:13,770 --> 03:49:14,450
Boom!

5833
03:49:17,630 --> 03:49:20,430
Oh god, I ran out of ammo!

5834
03:49:21,870 --> 03:49:22,630
Why

5835
03:49:30,530 --> 03:49:32,070
did I shoot him?

5836
03:49:38,480 --> 03:49:39,400
Oh god.

5837
03:49:41,280 --> 03:49:43,300
Oh my god, bro!

5838
03:49:43,580 --> 03:49:44,340
Invade!

5839
03:49:45,160 --> 03:49:46,100
Fuck, invade!

5840
03:49:53,580 --> 03:49:55,160
I forgot he's blind.

5841
03:49:55,340 --> 03:49:56,040
He's blind.

5842
03:49:56,180 --> 03:49:57,300
Don't walk into anything.

5843
03:50:00,400 --> 03:50:01,160
Don't!

5844
03:50:01,200 --> 03:50:01,620
Don't!

5845
03:50:01,620 --> 03:50:01,980
No!

5846
03:50:01,980 --> 03:50:02,540
Oh no!

5847
03:50:06,260 --> 03:50:06,460
Oh my god!

5848
03:50:06,740 --> 03:50:08,480
Oh my god!

5849
03:50:08,820 --> 03:50:10,100
He's blind!

5850
03:50:15,250 --> 03:50:15,630
Okay.

5851
03:50:17,250 --> 03:50:17,630
Okay.

5852
03:50:20,250 --> 03:50:21,330
It's okay, we did it.

5853
03:50:23,330 --> 03:50:23,710
Okay.

5854
03:50:24,050 --> 03:50:26,290
There goes my healing items.

5855
03:50:30,810 --> 03:50:32,710
There it goes.

5856
03:50:33,950 --> 03:50:35,830
I don't need a heal.

5857
03:50:36,670 --> 03:50:37,510
I don't...

5858
03:50:38,970 --> 03:50:40,910
There goes all my heals.

5859
03:50:42,910 --> 03:50:44,330
There it goes.

5860
03:50:47,290 --> 03:50:47,770
Woo!

5861
03:50:47,950 --> 03:50:51,570
Hey, but I got 3 shotgun ammo out of that.

5862
03:50:52,930 --> 03:50:53,410
Yeah!

5863
03:50:57,310 --> 03:50:58,270
Yippee!

5864
03:51:00,630 --> 03:51:01,590
Okay.

5865
03:51:08,610 --> 03:51:09,090
Okay.

5866
03:51:09,090 --> 03:51:11,690
Okay, that was a little stupid of me to just shoot him.

5867
03:51:13,290 --> 03:51:14,130
That was...

5868
03:51:15,190 --> 03:51:17,710
That was a little stupid of me.

5869
03:51:17,830 --> 03:51:19,010
Not gonna lie.

5870
03:51:21,370 --> 03:51:25,110
And then I kept running into the spikes because I got scared.

5871
03:51:25,910 --> 03:51:27,290
Because I was panicking.

5872
03:51:29,930 --> 03:51:33,310
I got a little scared, guys.

5873
03:51:34,590 --> 03:51:36,250
I can't think when I'm scared.

5874
03:51:44,850 --> 03:51:48,110
I don't think when I start panicking.

5875
03:51:48,250 --> 03:51:50,350
All I can think of is like shoot.

5876
03:51:50,610 --> 03:51:51,730
Shoot the gun.

5877
03:51:52,250 --> 03:51:53,330
Shoot the gun.

5878
03:51:55,070 --> 03:51:56,670
Doki, just shoot the gun.

5879
03:51:57,290 --> 03:51:59,050
Worry about stuff later.

5880
03:51:59,090 --> 03:51:59,790
Just shoot.

5881
03:52:05,840 --> 03:52:07,320
Open the door.

5882
03:52:11,680 --> 03:52:13,440
What happened down there?

5883
03:52:13,540 --> 03:52:15,160
Lots of things happened.

5884
03:52:15,580 --> 03:52:16,660
I don't know what happened.

5885
03:52:19,840 --> 03:52:22,740
Fear makes you do crazy things.

5886
03:52:23,200 --> 03:52:25,260
I need to go save now.

5887
03:52:25,580 --> 03:52:29,680
I need to grab those heal sprays I stocked up on.

5888
03:52:30,500 --> 03:52:31,760
Where are my chickens?

5889
03:52:32,580 --> 03:52:34,460
I missed the chickens.

5890
03:52:35,780 --> 03:52:38,780
If only I have the chickens.

5891
03:52:39,680 --> 03:52:41,020
If only I have the chickens.

5892
03:52:41,420 --> 03:52:44,180
Remember when I had all those eggs?

5893
03:52:44,760 --> 03:52:46,040
I remember.

5894
03:52:46,420 --> 03:52:47,100
I remember.

5895
03:52:47,100 --> 03:52:48,660
I remember.

5896
03:52:49,980 --> 03:52:53,640
That was the good life right there.

5897
03:52:54,220 --> 03:52:54,240
Welcome.

5898
03:52:54,240 --> 03:52:56,000
What can I interest you in?

5899
03:52:56,200 --> 03:52:58,400
Is that bango for circles?

5900
03:52:58,640 --> 03:52:58,760
Is that bango for circles?

5901
03:52:58,760 --> 03:52:59,440
It is.

5902
03:52:59,580 --> 03:53:01,140
I need like two reds.

5903
03:53:01,700 --> 03:53:03,420
Suit yourself, strength.

5904
03:53:03,520 --> 03:53:04,600
I missed the chickens.

5905
03:53:04,900 --> 03:53:06,240
I missed the free eggs.

5906
03:53:08,920 --> 03:53:11,200
I missed the free eggs.

5907
03:53:13,260 --> 03:53:16,840
Those were luxurious ta- I didn't know it was a luxury!

5908
03:53:19,000 --> 03:53:21,620
I didn't know they were a luxury!

5909
03:53:22,280 --> 03:53:22,460
I didn't know they were a luxury!

5910
03:53:24,360 --> 03:53:25,460
Can I use this?

5911
03:53:25,700 --> 03:53:25,980
No.

5912
03:53:26,140 --> 03:53:27,260
That's the dungeon key.

5913
03:53:27,400 --> 03:53:28,840
Can I use the dungeon key for anything?

5914
03:53:30,900 --> 03:53:32,000
I don't think so.

5915
03:53:32,740 --> 03:53:33,880
No eggs for me.

5916
03:53:37,740 --> 03:53:41,860
Why can't the fucking castle people raise chickens.

5917
03:53:43,140 --> 03:53:44,260
Where are my chickens?

5918
03:53:48,420 --> 03:53:48,900
Alright.

5919
03:53:49,280 --> 03:53:49,760
Use.

5920
03:53:54,560 --> 03:53:55,300
Oh, nice.

5921
03:53:55,460 --> 03:53:55,680
Okay.

5922
03:53:56,620 --> 03:53:57,100
Gunpowder.

5923
03:53:57,100 --> 03:53:57,680
Oh, that is good.

5924
03:53:57,860 --> 03:53:59,060
We actually need more of that.

5925
03:53:59,140 --> 03:54:00,520
We do not have any shotgun ammo.

5926
03:54:01,260 --> 03:54:02,100
Please, Ashley.

5927
03:54:02,920 --> 03:54:04,980
Help is not a concern right now.

5928
03:54:06,380 --> 03:54:08,860
Oh, I hear a little toy!

5929
03:54:12,080 --> 03:54:13,020
Where is he?

5930
03:54:14,900 --> 03:54:16,040
There you are.

5931
03:54:16,320 --> 03:54:17,220
I see you.

5932
03:54:17,640 --> 03:54:20,300
I already missed, apparently, a few anyway, so...

5933
03:54:20,300 --> 03:54:21,940
That doesn't matter.

5934
03:54:24,880 --> 03:54:25,700
Oh, nice.

5935
03:54:25,900 --> 03:54:26,540
A spinel.

5936
03:54:29,160 --> 03:54:29,720
Herbs.

5937
03:54:30,060 --> 03:54:30,620
Herbs.

5938
03:54:30,660 --> 03:54:31,860
I need the yellow herb.

5939
03:54:32,400 --> 03:54:34,420
That's the only thing I'm missing right now.

5940
03:54:35,760 --> 03:54:36,320
Okay.

5941
03:54:36,320 --> 03:54:36,960
Did I get everything?

5942
03:54:37,280 --> 03:54:38,000
The treasury.

5943
03:54:38,160 --> 03:54:38,660
Oh, no.

5944
03:54:39,700 --> 03:54:41,160
I'm having some fucking...

5945
03:54:41,160 --> 03:54:43,000
fucking PTSD right now.

5946
03:54:43,020 --> 03:54:44,000
Seeing the treasury.

5947
03:54:48,510 --> 03:54:49,390
Oh, no.

5948
03:54:49,570 --> 03:54:50,050
Wow.

5949
03:54:50,430 --> 03:54:51,270
I'm confused.

5950
03:54:54,810 --> 03:54:55,850
Oh, no.

5951
03:54:56,270 --> 03:54:58,690
I see this and I'm confused now.

5952
03:55:02,870 --> 03:55:03,390
Okay.

5953
03:55:04,390 --> 03:55:04,910
Okay.

5954
03:55:04,950 --> 03:55:05,770
There is lore.

5955
03:55:05,930 --> 03:55:06,350
Okay.

5956
03:55:06,390 --> 03:55:07,270
The iron sword.

5957
03:55:07,410 --> 03:55:08,370
We got the sword.

5958
03:55:09,530 --> 03:55:10,410
What have I...

5959
03:55:10,410 --> 03:55:11,510
We got the gold sword.

5960
03:55:11,690 --> 03:55:12,110
Okay.

5961
03:55:12,270 --> 03:55:14,070
And then we got the rusted sword.

5962
03:55:15,250 --> 03:55:16,410
Oh, it's a puzzle!

5963
03:55:18,770 --> 03:55:20,150
Can we not open this?

5964
03:55:20,470 --> 03:55:21,230
What do we do?

5965
03:55:25,230 --> 03:55:26,090
What does this do?

5966
03:55:29,850 --> 03:55:30,370
Okay.

5967
03:55:30,470 --> 03:55:30,970
Alright.

5968
03:55:31,130 --> 03:55:32,290
So, obviously...

5969
03:55:33,510 --> 03:55:37,110
This one would be the rusted sword because...

5970
03:55:38,370 --> 03:55:39,890
he's killing people?

5971
03:55:40,810 --> 03:55:41,330
No.

5972
03:55:41,510 --> 03:55:42,210
No, no, no.

5973
03:55:42,330 --> 03:55:42,890
Wait, wait, wait.

5974
03:55:43,690 --> 03:55:44,210
Okay.

5975
03:55:45,930 --> 03:55:46,610
Let's see.

5976
03:55:46,610 --> 03:55:49,130
This one will obviously be the gold sword.

5977
03:55:49,470 --> 03:55:49,870
Okay.

5978
03:55:52,170 --> 03:55:52,690
Let's see.

5979
03:55:52,690 --> 03:55:53,170
Because he's gold.

5980
03:55:54,250 --> 03:55:55,510
And then... Oh, no!

5981
03:55:55,570 --> 03:55:55,990
I'm right!

5982
03:55:56,410 --> 03:55:56,650
Wait.

5983
03:55:56,650 --> 03:55:57,810
I can ring those gongs by shooting them.

5984
03:55:58,250 --> 03:55:58,730
Wait.

5985
03:55:58,790 --> 03:55:59,970
I can ring those gongs?

5986
03:56:00,530 --> 03:56:01,050
What?

5987
03:56:01,890 --> 03:56:03,530
But, like, what about this room?

5988
03:56:03,590 --> 03:56:05,530
This one has to be the iron sword.

5989
03:56:06,690 --> 03:56:07,730
And then...

5990
03:56:09,570 --> 03:56:11,390
Why is there one sword empty?

5991
03:56:13,130 --> 03:56:13,930
Why is there one sword empty?

5992
03:56:13,930 --> 03:56:15,050
Why is this sword empty, though?

5993
03:56:15,110 --> 03:56:15,970
Why is this sword empty, though?

5994
03:56:20,300 --> 03:56:21,680
I don't have all the swords.

5995
03:56:21,760 --> 03:56:23,720
Oh, I don't have all the swords!

5996
03:56:26,180 --> 03:56:26,700
Oh!

5997
03:56:26,960 --> 03:56:29,320
I was gonna say, like, where the fuck are the other swords?

5998
03:56:29,660 --> 03:56:31,960
Like, where are the other swords?

5999
03:56:35,120 --> 03:56:35,640
Yeah.

6000
03:56:43,920 --> 03:56:44,960
And then...

6001
03:56:48,670 --> 03:56:49,190
What?

6002
03:56:51,630 --> 03:56:52,990
Did I waste my ammo?

6003
03:56:54,650 --> 03:56:55,950
What did I...

6004
03:56:55,950 --> 03:56:57,150
What did I...

6005
03:56:57,430 --> 03:56:57,650
Oh!

6006
03:56:58,570 --> 03:56:59,090
Wait!

6007
03:56:59,910 --> 03:57:00,430
Okay.

6008
03:57:01,150 --> 03:57:03,590
It's deer, bird, snake.

6009
03:57:04,170 --> 03:57:04,690
Okay.

6010
03:57:04,730 --> 03:57:05,710
Deer, bird, snake.

6011
03:57:05,910 --> 03:57:06,170
Okay.

6012
03:57:06,210 --> 03:57:06,790
It's a puzzle.

6013
03:57:07,770 --> 03:57:09,970
Wait, but which do I know goes first?

6014
03:57:10,110 --> 03:57:10,570
Deer...

6015
03:57:13,070 --> 03:57:13,590
Okay.

6016
03:57:13,630 --> 03:57:13,890
Here we go.

6017
03:57:14,810 --> 03:57:15,870
Oh, it's time?

6018
03:57:16,750 --> 03:57:17,270
Oh!

6019
03:57:20,410 --> 03:57:20,930
Okay.

6020
03:57:22,470 --> 03:57:23,630
Order is not necessary?

6021
03:57:23,730 --> 03:57:24,090
Okay.

6022
03:57:26,490 --> 03:57:27,010
Oh!

6023
03:57:27,430 --> 03:57:28,170
Wait, what?

6024
03:57:31,090 --> 03:57:32,890
Well, clearly it was not timed.

6025
03:57:37,730 --> 03:57:38,290
Okay.

6026
03:57:39,090 --> 03:57:39,890
Oh, no.

6027
03:57:39,990 --> 03:57:41,550
Now I don't think it's timed anymore.

6028
03:57:41,790 --> 03:57:44,270
Now I don't think it's timed.

6029
03:57:47,630 --> 03:57:50,490
This definitely did not feel timed anymore.

6030
03:57:50,490 --> 03:57:50,990
This definitely did not feel timed anymore.

6031
03:57:51,390 --> 03:57:53,650
This definitely did not feel timed anymore.

6032
03:57:54,730 --> 03:57:55,890
Wait, then what's this?

6033
03:57:59,770 --> 03:58:01,950
Why can I not ring that, but not the others?

6034
03:58:03,010 --> 03:58:07,890
This doesn't look like it's telling some kind of story.

6035
03:58:08,130 --> 03:58:08,150
This doesn't look like it's telling some kind of story.

6036
03:58:08,150 --> 03:58:09,250
Yes, I know, Ashley!

6037
03:58:09,950 --> 03:58:10,670
I know!

6038
03:58:12,170 --> 03:58:12,650
Okay.

6039
03:58:12,750 --> 03:58:13,010
Whoops.

6040
03:58:13,070 --> 03:58:13,290
Sorry.

6041
03:58:13,330 --> 03:58:14,070
That's not what I wanted.

6042
03:58:14,570 --> 03:58:15,050
Okay.

6043
03:58:15,070 --> 03:58:15,930
Bloody sword.

6044
03:58:16,030 --> 03:58:17,010
There we go.

6045
03:58:17,090 --> 03:58:17,230
Okay.

6046
03:58:17,230 --> 03:58:17,230
Bloody sword.

6047
03:58:17,230 --> 03:58:17,230
There we go.

6048
03:58:17,230 --> 03:58:19,090
And then iron sword.

6049
03:58:19,210 --> 03:58:19,430
Bah.

6050
03:58:19,430 --> 03:58:20,090
Rested sword.

6051
03:58:20,210 --> 03:58:20,370
Bah.

6052
03:58:20,790 --> 03:58:21,610
Door open.

6053
03:58:27,090 --> 03:58:27,570
Alright.

6054
03:58:27,690 --> 03:58:28,110
Nice.

6055
03:58:28,330 --> 03:58:29,330
Of course I'm right.

6056
03:58:29,490 --> 03:58:31,770
Ashley, I didn't need your help.

6057
03:58:32,590 --> 03:58:33,890
That's what chat is for.

6058
03:58:34,110 --> 03:58:35,110
Ashley, are you chat?

6059
03:58:35,330 --> 03:58:35,630
No.

6060
03:58:35,950 --> 03:58:37,810
You didn't join my membership.

6061
03:58:38,530 --> 03:58:39,270
You didn't join my membership.

6062
03:58:40,470 --> 03:58:41,490
You're not subscribed.

6063
03:58:41,790 --> 03:58:45,330
When you subscribe to me, Ashley, then you can bat-seek me.

6064
03:58:45,510 --> 03:58:46,690
There's a fucking snake?

6065
03:58:47,330 --> 03:58:48,270
Where did he go?

6066
03:58:48,530 --> 03:58:49,190
Oh, there he is.

6067
03:58:49,430 --> 03:58:50,410
Why can't I just step on it?

6068
03:58:52,110 --> 03:58:52,850
That snake.

6069
03:58:53,890 --> 03:58:54,330
Okay.

6070
03:58:55,530 --> 03:58:57,610
Ashley, you can only back-seek me when you subscribe.

6071
03:58:58,830 --> 03:58:59,270
Chaotic!

6072
03:58:59,270 --> 03:59:00,070
Thank you for the super chat!

6073
03:59:00,150 --> 03:59:00,430
Thank you!

6074
03:59:00,470 --> 03:59:00,890
Thank you!

6075
03:59:00,990 --> 03:59:01,610
Fake fan.

6076
03:59:01,830 --> 03:59:02,330
I know, right?

6077
03:59:02,470 --> 03:59:03,290
Fucking fake fan.

6078
03:59:03,490 --> 03:59:04,050
Fake ass.

6079
03:59:04,790 --> 03:59:05,450
Oh, nice.

6080
03:59:05,530 --> 03:59:06,030
Gold bangle.

6081
03:59:06,710 --> 03:59:07,510
We need that.

6082
03:59:08,550 --> 03:59:08,990
Alright.

6083
03:59:09,090 --> 03:59:09,630
Out we go.

6084
03:59:11,870 --> 03:59:12,310
Oh.

6085
03:59:15,050 --> 03:59:15,930
Let's see.

6086
03:59:18,090 --> 03:59:19,270
Oh, I don't like this.

6087
03:59:19,690 --> 03:59:20,470
Oh, I don't like this.

6088
03:59:23,910 --> 03:59:24,870
You're so smart.

6089
03:59:26,910 --> 03:59:28,050
Ashley, you're so smart.

6090
03:59:28,690 --> 03:59:29,890
Head for the courtyard.

6091
03:59:30,390 --> 03:59:30,970
Where the fuck?

6092
03:59:31,090 --> 03:59:32,010
Oh, that's the courtyard.

6093
03:59:32,190 --> 03:59:32,950
Okay, but there's loot.

6094
03:59:33,650 --> 03:59:34,050
Ashley.

6095
03:59:34,910 --> 03:59:35,690
There's loot though.

6096
03:59:36,630 --> 03:59:38,050
We can't just head to the courtyard.

6097
03:59:38,710 --> 03:59:39,810
We need to grab the loot.

6098
03:59:41,650 --> 03:59:42,950
Okay, there is- Oh wait!

6099
03:59:43,110 --> 03:59:43,810
Can we...

6100
03:59:45,930 --> 03:59:46,650
Lower the ladder?

6101
03:59:46,810 --> 03:59:48,110
Oh, that's so convenient.

6102
03:59:48,770 --> 03:59:49,930
Thank fucking god.

6103
03:59:51,430 --> 03:59:52,590
Wait, can I jump here?

6104
03:59:54,110 --> 03:59:55,850
I don't know if this is like for jumping.

6105
04:00:00,080 --> 04:00:01,000
Oh, okay.

6106
04:00:02,240 --> 04:00:02,640
Ring!

6107
04:00:04,900 --> 04:00:05,300
Ring!

6108
04:00:06,340 --> 04:00:07,300
Wait, is that a snake?

6109
04:00:09,300 --> 04:00:10,300
Okay, that's a snake.

6110
04:00:10,400 --> 04:00:10,640
Okay.

6111
04:00:10,720 --> 04:00:12,060
Where the fuck is the snake?

6112
04:00:13,600 --> 04:00:15,480
Israel, thank you for the 10 gifted chips!

6113
04:00:15,600 --> 04:00:15,840
Thank you!

6114
04:00:16,000 --> 04:00:16,440
Thank you!

6115
04:00:16,560 --> 04:00:17,320
Can I jump?

6116
04:00:17,440 --> 04:00:17,660
Oh, I can jump.

6117
04:00:17,680 --> 04:00:19,060
Thank fucking god.

6118
04:00:19,960 --> 04:00:20,920
It's called...

6119
04:00:21,500 --> 04:00:21,980
Parkour!

6120
04:00:23,080 --> 04:00:24,340
You wouldn't understand.

6121
04:00:25,200 --> 04:00:26,800
You're not as cool as me.

6122
04:00:27,180 --> 04:00:27,940
Is that snake?

6123
04:00:28,260 --> 04:00:28,960
No, that's bird.

6124
04:00:29,260 --> 04:00:30,600
Where the fuck is snake?

6125
04:00:31,320 --> 04:00:32,440
Oh, wait.

6126
04:00:32,960 --> 04:00:33,700
I'll be back.

6127
04:00:34,780 --> 04:00:35,780
I'll be back, Ashley.

6128
04:00:36,020 --> 04:00:36,860
There's loot here.

6129
04:00:37,880 --> 04:00:38,360
Nice.

6130
04:00:39,640 --> 04:00:40,120
Okay.

6131
04:00:40,260 --> 04:00:40,740
Guys!

6132
04:00:40,860 --> 04:00:42,100
Oh, I thought I was gonna kick it.

6133
04:00:44,280 --> 04:00:44,760
Sashkin!

6134
04:00:44,920 --> 04:00:46,100
Welcome to the tomato farm!

6135
04:00:46,180 --> 04:00:46,780
Welcome, welcome!

6136
04:00:47,680 --> 04:00:48,020
Chat!

6137
04:00:48,220 --> 04:00:49,020
Thank you for the super chat!

6138
04:00:49,120 --> 04:00:49,780
Thank you, thank you!

6139
04:00:50,620 --> 04:00:51,880
Okay, we need to sell...

6140
04:00:51,880 --> 04:00:53,160
Wait, where did you come from?

6141
04:00:54,400 --> 04:00:54,840
Okay.

6142
04:00:55,020 --> 04:00:57,380
Do we not need the dungeon key anymore?

6143
04:00:57,820 --> 04:00:58,660
No, we don't.

6144
04:00:59,560 --> 04:01:00,000
Okay.

6145
04:01:00,640 --> 04:01:01,080
Whoa.

6146
04:01:01,320 --> 04:01:03,200
Sorry, I'm like fucking freaking out right now.

6147
04:01:04,660 --> 04:01:05,540
Gold banga...

6149
04:01:06,820 --> 04:01:08,300

6150
04:01:10,780 --> 04:01:11,220
and...

6151
04:01:11,220 --> 04:01:15,460
Can we... If the poison glands are removed, it may be... Okay, yeah.

6152
04:01:15,520 --> 04:01:16,000
Never mind.

6153
04:01:16,060 --> 04:01:17,160
I'm not gonna eat the snake.

6154
04:01:17,280 --> 04:01:17,660
I'm just gonna...

6155
04:01:17,680 --> 04:01:18,260
sell it.

6156
04:01:19,300 --> 04:01:20,580
Yeah, I'm gonna sell it.

6157
04:01:20,660 --> 04:01:21,560
I don't trust myself.

6158
04:01:21,920 --> 04:01:24,040
I don't trust myself.

6159
04:01:25,480 --> 04:01:29,820
I feel like something bad is gonna happen if I try to eat the snake.

6160
04:01:32,200 --> 04:01:32,640
Alright.

6161
04:01:37,090 --> 04:01:37,790
Let's see.

6162
04:01:39,110 --> 04:01:39,950
We gotta...

6163
04:01:39,950 --> 04:01:41,030
Where the fuck is the ladder?

6164
04:01:41,230 --> 04:01:41,730
Oh, there it is.

6165
04:01:42,170 --> 04:01:43,650
We need to find the snake.

6166
04:01:45,890 --> 04:01:46,330
Jonesy!

6167
04:01:46,330 --> 04:01:47,270
Thank you for the super chat!

6168
04:01:47,350 --> 04:01:48,230
Thank you, thank you!

6169
04:01:48,230 --> 04:01:49,670
Donated a Doki Leon.

6170
04:01:49,810 --> 04:01:51,450
Save the gun, please!

6171
04:01:52,410 --> 04:01:54,230
Thank you for the super chat.

6172
04:01:54,410 --> 04:01:55,330
Thank you, thank you!

6173
04:01:55,790 --> 04:01:56,690
Maybe here?

6174
04:01:58,250 --> 04:01:59,430
Is the snake here?

6175
04:02:01,770 --> 04:02:02,730
Is this snake?

6176
04:02:02,890 --> 04:02:03,590
No, this is bird.

6177
04:02:03,810 --> 04:02:04,730
Wait, I was here.

6178
04:02:05,150 --> 04:02:06,730
I literally jumped from here.

6179
04:02:06,910 --> 04:02:07,950
I couldn't count.

6180
04:02:08,930 --> 04:02:09,870
It's this way.

6181
04:02:09,990 --> 04:02:10,690
Sorry, Ashley.

6182
04:02:11,030 --> 04:02:12,430
It was this way!

6183
04:02:13,610 --> 04:02:14,170
Boop!

6184
04:02:15,070 --> 04:02:16,050
Here I go!

6185
04:02:16,670 --> 04:02:17,230
Whoa!

6186
04:02:20,670 --> 04:02:21,510
Snake here?

6187
04:02:22,110 --> 04:02:22,670
Snake?

6188
04:02:24,310 --> 04:02:25,370
Where the fuck...

6189
04:02:25,370 --> 04:02:26,770
Where's the snake?

6190
04:02:28,150 --> 04:02:29,570
Where the fuck's the snake?

6191
04:02:30,850 --> 04:02:31,410
Bro.

6192
04:02:32,870 --> 04:02:34,330
Oh, in front of me.

6193
04:02:37,570 --> 04:02:38,610
Sorry, guys.

6194
04:02:39,290 --> 04:02:40,130
I'm blind.

6195
04:02:41,030 --> 04:02:41,950
Whoa, Ashley!

6196
04:02:42,230 --> 04:02:43,510
What the fuck!

6197
04:02:47,110 --> 04:02:48,590
Bro, I almost shot her.

6198
04:02:48,850 --> 04:02:49,670
I almost shot her.

6199
04:02:49,690 --> 04:02:51,770
I actually almost shot her.

6200
04:02:54,270 --> 04:02:56,630
Bro, she scared the shit out of me.

6201
04:02:58,210 --> 04:02:58,730
Bro, she scared the shit out of me.

6202
04:02:58,730 --> 04:02:59,370
Okay, here we go.

6203
04:03:01,090 --> 04:03:02,130
Holy shit!

6204
04:03:02,430 --> 04:03:04,050
Ashley, don't do that.

6205
04:03:05,010 --> 04:03:07,310
That actually wasn't Ashley jump scare.

6206
04:03:07,410 --> 04:03:08,530
Don't fucking do that again.

6207
04:03:09,410 --> 04:03:09,930
Don't fucking do that again.

6208
04:03:09,930 --> 04:03:10,310
Holy fuck.

6209
04:03:10,850 --> 04:03:12,770
That scared the shit out of me, man.

6210
04:03:13,130 --> 04:03:14,590
Don't fucking do that again.

6211
04:03:14,990 --> 04:03:17,190
Don't do that again.

6212
04:03:17,190 --> 04:03:18,890
Okay, shotgun.

6213
04:03:19,110 --> 04:03:21,550
Oh my god, 17 for Magnum?

6214
04:03:21,730 --> 04:03:24,950
Now we're using the Magnum until we fucking go to the boss.

6215
04:03:25,450 --> 04:03:27,210
The scene kid jump scare.

6216
04:03:27,370 --> 04:03:28,010
Scene kid!

6217
04:03:31,230 --> 04:03:33,810
You're never prepared for the scene kid.

6218
04:03:38,980 --> 04:03:40,180
Okay, gunpowder.

6219
04:03:40,240 --> 04:03:40,580
Nice.

6220
04:03:45,260 --> 04:03:46,740
What is this?

6221
04:03:49,500 --> 04:03:50,560
What is this, Salazar?

6222
04:03:51,240 --> 04:03:52,040
What is this, Salazar?

6223
04:03:52,600 --> 04:03:52,960
Hello.

6224
04:03:55,420 --> 04:03:55,540
No.

6225
04:03:55,740 --> 04:03:56,460
No, I'm not.

6226
04:03:56,580 --> 04:03:57,180
No, I'm not.

6227
04:03:57,960 --> 04:03:58,760
No, I'm not.

6228
04:04:02,460 --> 04:04:03,640
What do you mean by that?

6229
04:04:03,720 --> 04:04:04,420
What do you mean by that?

6230
04:04:04,720 --> 04:04:05,380
What do you mean by that?

6231
04:04:09,740 --> 04:04:10,460
What is this?

6232
04:04:14,910 --> 04:04:15,870
I don't like this.

6233
04:04:16,830 --> 04:04:17,430
I don't.

6234
04:04:18,490 --> 04:04:19,430
I don't like this.

6235
04:04:20,410 --> 04:04:22,550
Salazar, I don't like this.

6236
04:04:23,890 --> 04:04:24,970
I don't...

6237
04:04:25,510 --> 04:04:26,270
Shoot the bell?

6238
04:04:26,490 --> 04:04:27,270
Where's the bell?

6239
04:04:27,710 --> 04:04:29,210
There's no bells here.

6240
04:04:30,190 --> 04:04:32,170
Where do you see the fucking bell?

6241
04:04:34,190 --> 04:04:35,210
Am I blind again?

6242
04:04:39,670 --> 04:04:42,270
Am I... Am I blind again, guys?

6243
04:04:42,830 --> 04:04:43,930
Where's the bell?

6244
04:04:49,210 --> 04:04:51,450
Guys, where the fuck's the bell?

6245
04:04:53,250 --> 04:04:55,330
I am using eyes!

6246
04:04:55,470 --> 04:04:56,530
I don't see no bell.

6247
04:05:01,770 --> 04:05:03,770
Use your third eyes.

6248
04:05:04,510 --> 04:05:06,710
Oh, the speakerphone!

6249
04:05:06,830 --> 04:05:09,050
Bro, where the fuck's the speakerphone?

6250
04:05:10,550 --> 04:05:13,090
Where did the speakerphone come from?

6251
04:05:21,910 --> 04:05:23,530
This is not good.

6252
04:05:26,750 --> 04:05:30,890
I'm gonna grab some ammo and some money.

6253
04:05:32,270 --> 04:05:35,410
Okay, this way is quest tab.

6254
04:05:35,530 --> 04:05:37,030
This way is items.

6255
04:05:40,530 --> 04:05:42,530
This way is loot.

6256
04:05:45,070 --> 04:05:45,750
Typewriter!

6257
04:05:46,510 --> 04:05:47,190
Typewriter.

6258
04:05:47,470 --> 04:05:47,970
Nice.

6259
04:05:52,040 --> 04:05:55,320
There are some parasites that have the ability to control their host.

6260
04:05:55,600 --> 04:06:00,180
This is basic knowledge among most biologists, but not much is known about it.

6261
04:06:00,180 --> 04:06:02,000
There are some parasites that are known as to how the parasites do it.

6262
04:06:03,720 --> 04:06:06,160
The following is a list of several such parasites.

6263
04:06:06,600 --> 04:06:07,700
The Dicro.

6264
04:06:07,920 --> 04:06:11,560
Once the larvae of the parasite migrates to the ant, they alter...

6265
04:06:11,560 --> 04:06:14,340
Oh, this is the last of us.

6266
04:06:14,980 --> 04:06:16,400
That's the mushrooms.

6267
04:06:17,420 --> 04:06:23,860
The larvae of this parasite makes their home inside the brain of a fish, such as the yellowtail and parrot bass.

6268
04:06:24,060 --> 04:06:30,160
Once infected, the fish makes its way up to the water surface where it will swim until eaten by seabirds.

6269
04:06:30,160 --> 04:06:30,640
Oh yeah!

6270
04:06:30,820 --> 04:06:35,640
So the reason why is that the birds, when they eat it, the parasite like...

6271
04:06:36,160 --> 04:06:39,460
The parasite can only like reproduce in their shit.

6272
04:06:39,740 --> 04:06:44,260
So like the fish, you know, the way it spreads is by bird poop.

6273
04:06:44,600 --> 04:06:45,260
I know this!

6274
04:06:45,600 --> 04:06:46,080
I don't know.

6275
04:06:46,120 --> 04:06:48,280
I don't remember when I learned it, but I know it.

6276
04:06:49,860 --> 04:06:52,740
There's parasites developed in the snail's eye stalks.

6277
04:06:52,740 --> 04:06:53,400
Oh, I've seen these.

6278
04:06:53,480 --> 04:06:55,540
They make it look like they're at a rave.

6279
04:06:55,920 --> 04:06:58,920
Those parasites make the snails look like they're at a rave.

6280
04:06:59,420 --> 04:07:02,140
This is also... A lot of them are just like...

6281
04:07:02,140 --> 04:07:04,280
A lot of them spread by bird poop.

6282
04:07:05,820 --> 04:07:11,820
They alter the snail's behavior and force it to move to the top of the plant to make it more visible to birds.

6283
04:07:12,020 --> 04:07:16,080
Once eaten by the bird, the parasite will complete its metamorphosis into an adult.

6284
04:07:16,860 --> 04:07:18,000
The rainbow snails.

6285
04:07:18,020 --> 04:07:18,180
Yeah!

6286
04:07:18,600 --> 04:07:21,880
They're in fucking pain and they are dying, but it looks cool!

6287
04:07:25,580 --> 04:07:26,060
Okay.

6288
04:07:27,020 --> 04:07:27,500
No...

6289
04:07:27,500 --> 04:07:30,500
This is the objective, so I'm gonna go this way.

6290
04:07:32,460 --> 04:07:33,460
Nope, the door is locked.

6291
04:07:33,540 --> 04:07:35,040
Alright, I guess we don't go that way.

6292
04:07:38,700 --> 04:07:41,080
I love it when we don't go that way.

6293
04:07:42,500 --> 04:07:44,060
Wait, does that make an open this door?

6294
04:07:45,280 --> 04:07:45,880
Yeah, right?

6295
04:07:46,000 --> 04:07:46,400
I can!

6296
04:07:46,760 --> 04:07:47,160
Nice.

6297
04:07:47,380 --> 04:07:47,780
Shortcut.

6298
04:07:48,960 --> 04:07:49,360
Yay!

6299
04:07:51,680 --> 04:07:53,680
I'll never go back that way.

6300
04:07:54,620 --> 04:07:55,800
Oh, can I just shoot it?

6301
04:07:55,980 --> 04:07:57,280
Oh, it's next to the door?

6302
04:07:58,300 --> 04:07:59,440
Wait, so I just shoot this?

6303
04:08:00,680 --> 04:08:01,220
Where?

6304
04:08:02,540 --> 04:08:03,760
Where's the speaker?

6305
04:08:04,940 --> 04:08:07,040
Or you mean the downstairs door?

6306
04:08:12,470 --> 04:08:13,590
Where's the door?

6307
04:08:15,070 --> 04:08:15,770
Hahaha!

6308
04:08:19,150 --> 04:08:21,130
Guys, where's the bell?

6309
04:08:24,070 --> 04:08:26,170
Oh, by the typewriter!

6310
04:08:26,950 --> 04:08:28,150
Other door!

6311
04:08:30,050 --> 04:08:31,170
Where's the bell?

6312
04:08:33,310 --> 04:08:33,870
Bell!

6313
04:08:34,710 --> 04:08:36,070
Oh, barrel though.

6314
04:08:39,170 --> 04:08:39,730
Bell?

6315
04:08:40,450 --> 04:08:43,050
Guys, I swear to fucking god, are you fucking with me?

6316
04:08:43,330 --> 04:08:43,890
Guys...

6317
04:08:43,890 --> 04:08:44,350
Hahaha!

6318
04:08:47,090 --> 04:08:48,190
I swear...

6319
04:08:48,190 --> 04:08:49,610
Outside this...

6320
04:08:49,610 --> 04:08:49,750
Oh!

6321
04:08:49,810 --> 04:08:50,710
Outside this...

6322
04:08:50,710 --> 04:08:53,790
Guys, I swear to fucking god, are you fucking with me?

6323
04:08:54,210 --> 04:08:54,770
Oh!

6324
04:08:55,050 --> 04:08:56,210
There it is!

6325
04:08:56,270 --> 04:08:56,910
This one!

6326
04:08:57,050 --> 04:08:57,330
Right?

6327
04:08:58,730 --> 04:09:00,590
I don't want to die, I don't want to die!

6328
04:09:00,590 --> 04:09:01,150
Oh!

6329
04:09:01,150 --> 04:09:01,470
Like that?

6330
04:09:04,790 --> 04:09:06,310
It's too late now?

6331
04:09:06,550 --> 04:09:07,170
No!

6332
04:09:11,370 --> 04:09:12,390
Don't pause.

6333
04:09:12,610 --> 04:09:14,310
What happens if I do it?

6334
04:09:14,830 --> 04:09:17,050
Okay, I'm just gonna save.

6335
04:09:19,660 --> 04:09:21,470
Look guys, that's not a bell.

6336
04:09:21,890 --> 04:09:23,610
This is not a bell!

6337
04:09:24,030 --> 04:09:25,310
It's like those like...

6338
04:09:25,310 --> 04:09:26,070
It's a speaker!

6339
04:09:26,570 --> 04:09:28,830
Guys, it's because you didn't say speaker.

6340
04:09:28,830 --> 04:09:32,570
If you said speaker, I would have known what you're talking about.

6341
04:09:32,710 --> 04:09:33,670
But you said bell.

6342
04:09:33,890 --> 04:09:35,070
What the f*** is a bell?

6343
04:09:35,170 --> 04:09:35,950
That's not a bell.

6344
04:09:36,730 --> 04:09:38,010
Bells do not look like that.

6345
04:09:39,550 --> 04:09:41,410
I just realized I have to do the f***ing maze.

6346
04:09:41,770 --> 04:09:44,010
I just remembered the maze.

6347
04:09:44,430 --> 04:09:45,990
The maze f***ing sucked, man.

6348
04:09:46,910 --> 04:09:47,670
Fudge top!

6349
04:09:47,850 --> 04:09:48,950
Thank you for the super chat.

6350
04:09:49,050 --> 04:09:49,330
Thank you.

6351
04:09:49,330 --> 04:09:49,750
Thank you.

6352
04:09:49,750 --> 04:09:52,950
Doki, since you're a bird too, can you make sure you get yourself checked after this?

6353
04:09:53,850 --> 04:09:55,330
Thank you for the super chat.

6354
04:09:55,390 --> 04:09:55,710
Thank you.

6355
04:09:57,390 --> 04:09:58,270
Oh no!

6356
04:09:58,370 --> 04:09:58,810
Doki!

6357
04:09:58,810 --> 04:09:59,770
God damn it.

6358
04:09:59,790 --> 04:10:00,390
I've got my rifle.

6359
04:10:00,630 --> 04:10:02,530
I got my rifle.

6360
04:10:02,670 --> 04:10:04,110
God f***ing damn it.

6361
04:10:04,130 --> 04:10:04,470
Here we go.

6362
04:10:04,790 --> 04:10:05,390
Ashley.

6363
04:10:05,550 --> 04:10:07,430
God f***ing damn it.

6364
04:10:07,510 --> 04:10:08,390
I hate this level.

6365
04:10:11,530 --> 04:10:12,930
I remember this.

6366
04:10:15,470 --> 04:10:16,070
Where?

6367
04:10:25,580 --> 04:10:26,600
Wait, what?

6368
04:10:26,680 --> 04:10:28,520
Who f***ing shot you?

6369
04:10:33,480 --> 04:10:35,440
Oh my god, I hate this.

6370
04:10:35,640 --> 04:10:37,200
I hate this.

6371
04:10:40,040 --> 04:10:41,140
Oh god.

6372
04:10:46,250 --> 04:10:47,290
Oh god.

6373
04:11:01,450 --> 04:11:04,610
This one sucks more as a...

6374
04:11:05,530 --> 04:11:07,870
This one sucks more in the O.G.

6375
04:11:08,010 --> 04:11:10,990
I knew it.

6376
04:11:11,190 --> 04:11:11,890
Ashley!

6377
04:11:12,110 --> 04:11:12,490
What?

6378
04:11:12,950 --> 04:11:15,070
Who f***ing shot you?

6379
04:11:15,070 --> 04:11:15,370
Shoo!

6380
04:11:17,950 --> 04:11:18,450
Where?

6381
04:11:19,430 --> 04:11:19,930
Where?

6382
04:11:20,030 --> 04:11:21,810
I don't see the arrows!

6383
04:11:24,050 --> 04:11:24,550
Where?

6384
04:11:24,670 --> 04:11:26,130
Oh my god, there.

6385
04:11:32,730 --> 04:11:33,730
Jesus Christ.

6386
04:11:34,470 --> 04:11:34,970
Okay.

6387
04:11:36,770 --> 04:11:38,130
This is way worse.

6388
04:11:38,210 --> 04:11:39,350
I like the old one.

6389
04:11:44,030 --> 04:11:45,210
I got her.

6390
04:11:45,290 --> 04:11:46,090
Where did you go, Ashley?

6391
04:11:46,550 --> 04:11:47,570
Where did you go?

6392
04:11:52,580 --> 04:11:53,700
I am not okay.

6393
04:11:53,800 --> 04:11:54,720
I am not okay.

6394
04:11:54,820 --> 04:11:56,260
I don't know why I said I'm okay.

6395
04:11:56,340 --> 04:11:56,940
I'm not okay.

6396
04:11:57,140 --> 04:11:59,260
I do not feel okay right now.

6397
04:11:59,360 --> 04:12:01,180
I do not feel okay.

6398
04:12:03,060 --> 04:12:03,540
Really?

6399
04:12:04,860 --> 04:12:08,400
I like the old one more because I can literally just stand still.

6400
04:12:10,580 --> 04:12:13,260
Unless that's a different level I was thinking of.

6401
04:12:14,840 --> 04:12:18,100
I know there was one where I could just snipe and stand still.

6402
04:12:23,420 --> 04:12:24,180
Oh god.

6403
04:12:28,450 --> 04:12:29,370
Where is it?

6404
04:12:32,650 --> 04:12:34,030
I hear them!

6405
04:12:36,590 --> 04:12:38,830
I hear... they're just breathing heavily!

6406
04:12:39,030 --> 04:12:39,950
Where are you?

6407
04:12:45,910 --> 04:12:47,650
He's just breathing heavily!

6408
04:12:49,530 --> 04:12:50,330
I'm below.

6409
04:12:51,110 --> 04:12:51,970
Okay, guys.

6410
04:12:52,030 --> 04:12:52,490
I need loot.

6411
04:12:52,630 --> 04:12:54,030
Guys, I need loot first.

6412
04:12:55,410 --> 04:12:56,830
I don't have a lot.

6413
04:12:56,890 --> 04:12:58,590
Please tell me I can crash shotgun.

6414
04:12:58,650 --> 04:12:59,510
So, thank god.

6415
04:13:00,130 --> 04:13:01,310
Oh, thank god.

6416
04:13:01,350 --> 04:13:01,610
Okay.

6417
04:13:01,610 --> 04:13:01,850
Okay.

6418
04:13:07,040 --> 04:13:08,120
Okay, I need to make sure.

6419
04:13:11,600 --> 04:13:12,140
Wait, what?

6420
04:13:12,820 --> 04:13:13,360
Wait, what?

6421
04:13:13,920 --> 04:13:15,000
Wait, what was that sound?

6422
04:13:15,080 --> 04:13:15,700
What is that sound?

6423
04:13:15,760 --> 04:13:16,360
What is that sound?

6424
04:13:16,380 --> 04:13:16,920
What is that sound?

6425
04:13:18,080 --> 04:13:18,740
Where are they?

6426
04:13:19,900 --> 04:13:20,480
What is that?

6427
04:13:20,500 --> 04:13:21,580
I don't like that sound!

6428
04:13:21,700 --> 04:13:24,760
I don't like that sound!

6429
04:13:26,720 --> 04:13:27,460
Where are they?

6430
04:13:27,660 --> 04:13:29,100
Where the fuck are they?

6431
04:13:30,180 --> 04:13:30,900
Stop whispering!

6432
04:13:31,300 --> 04:13:31,620
Stop whispering!

6433
04:13:35,040 --> 04:13:36,180
Stop whispering, please.

6434
04:13:36,280 --> 04:13:37,100
Stop whispering.

6435
04:13:37,560 --> 04:13:38,360
Stop whispering.

6436
04:13:38,440 --> 04:13:39,520
I don't like it when you whisper.

6437
04:13:48,690 --> 04:13:50,010
I'm gonna get rid of these guys.

6438
04:13:55,990 --> 04:13:58,370
Okay, I just want to get rid of these guys first.

6439
04:14:00,490 --> 04:14:01,110
Like, I...

6440
04:14:02,330 --> 04:14:02,730
Okay.

6441
04:14:02,730 --> 04:14:03,410
Is he...

6442
04:14:04,790 --> 04:14:06,690
Okay, I don't know if I'm shooting him.

6443
04:14:09,370 --> 04:14:10,770
Is he getting shot at?

6444
04:14:10,770 --> 04:14:12,030
I can't tell!

6445
04:14:20,620 --> 04:14:22,820
Are you getting shot at?

6446
04:14:22,880 --> 04:14:23,220
Bro!

6447
04:14:23,760 --> 04:14:25,160
I'm just gonna use my pistol.

6448
04:14:25,840 --> 04:14:28,760
Like, that was... I can't believe I wasted my rifle ammo.

6449
04:14:29,160 --> 04:14:30,500
I can't believe it.

6450
04:14:30,680 --> 04:14:33,060
Bro, I can't tell if he's getting shot at.

6451
04:14:33,840 --> 04:14:35,400
Like, he can't tell.

6452
04:14:37,220 --> 04:14:37,760
Alright.

6453
04:14:38,620 --> 04:14:39,780
Is he taking damage?

6454
04:14:40,020 --> 04:14:40,680
He is, right?

6455
04:14:44,400 --> 04:14:45,080
No!

6456
04:14:45,300 --> 04:14:46,400
It's a waste!

6457
04:14:46,980 --> 04:14:49,060
My pistol can't kill him!

6458
04:14:50,380 --> 04:14:51,680
It's a fucking waste!

6459
04:14:52,400 --> 04:14:54,740
It's a waste of a good flashbang!

6460
04:14:59,520 --> 04:15:00,200
Jesus!

6461
04:15:00,300 --> 04:15:01,700
He's so tanky!

6462
04:15:02,960 --> 04:15:04,680
He's still walking!

6463
04:15:07,780 --> 04:15:09,260
I can't see them.

6464
04:15:14,320 --> 04:15:15,360
He's still walking.

6465
04:15:15,540 --> 04:15:16,500
Oh, he has a helmet!

6466
04:15:16,880 --> 04:15:17,640
That's cheating!

6467
04:15:20,920 --> 04:15:23,450
One grenade versus a hundred bullets!

6468
04:15:24,380 --> 04:15:26,620
Look, that's the risk I'm willing to take.

6469
04:15:27,440 --> 04:15:30,900
That's the risk I'm willing to take.

6470
04:15:33,820 --> 04:15:35,820
Look, I need that flash grenade.

6471
04:15:35,920 --> 04:15:36,720
You don't understand...

6472
04:15:36,720 --> 04:15:37,720
Oh, there's a vase up here!

6473
04:15:37,820 --> 04:15:38,120
Sorry.

6474
04:15:38,280 --> 04:15:38,860
Give me a sec.

6475
04:15:39,300 --> 04:15:41,640
There's... there's two vases up here that I missed.

6476
04:15:43,820 --> 04:15:45,380
Oh, I don't like this.

6477
04:15:46,140 --> 04:15:46,740
Oh, I don't like this.

6478
04:15:46,740 --> 04:15:47,760
I don't like this.

6479
04:15:47,860 --> 04:15:49,900
Why is it intensifying?

6480
04:15:51,860 --> 04:15:54,810
I don't like this.

6481
04:15:54,810 --> 04:15:54,890
Why is it intensifying?

6482
04:15:54,890 --> 04:15:55,490
Oh!

6483
04:15:55,950 --> 04:15:57,390
What's that sound?

6484
04:16:01,030 --> 04:16:01,990
Oh, God.

6485
04:16:06,870 --> 04:16:07,830
I'm scared.

6486
04:16:07,850 --> 04:16:09,010
I know there's one more.

6487
04:16:09,270 --> 04:16:09,470
I'm scared.

6488
04:16:09,470 --> 04:16:09,470
I know there's one more.

6489
04:16:09,650 --> 04:16:11,310
Like, he's here somewhere.

6490
04:16:12,930 --> 04:16:14,750
He's here somewhere, guys.

6491
04:16:14,950 --> 04:16:15,070
He's here somewhere, guys.

6492
04:16:15,070 --> 04:16:16,230
There's one more.

6493
04:16:20,770 --> 04:16:21,650
There's one more.

6494
04:16:21,650 --> 04:16:22,930
Bro, I don't even have flash grenades.

6495
04:16:23,070 --> 04:16:23,590
What the fuck?

6496
04:16:23,630 --> 04:16:24,550
What are you guys talking about?

6497
04:16:24,690 --> 04:16:25,650
We don't even have...

6498
04:16:25,650 --> 04:16:26,330
I'm like, how...

6499
04:16:26,330 --> 04:16:28,450
We don't even have flash grenades!

6500
04:16:29,070 --> 04:16:30,670
Why were you yelling me?

6501
04:16:31,010 --> 04:16:32,910
We don't even have one!

6502
04:16:43,110 --> 04:16:46,550
I can't believe you guys yelled at me about the flash grenades.

6503
04:16:46,870 --> 04:16:48,410
When we never even had one.

6504
04:16:52,900 --> 04:16:53,720
I can't believe it.

6505
04:16:54,960 --> 04:16:55,400
There.

6506
04:16:55,460 --> 04:16:58,060
See, I told you eventually we will kill these guys.

6507
04:16:59,540 --> 04:17:00,420
We eventually...

6508
04:17:01,720 --> 04:17:03,140
We had enough bullets.

6509
04:17:03,260 --> 04:17:04,720
Oh my God, I could have shot this.

6510
04:17:08,690 --> 04:17:09,290
Here we go.

6511
04:17:10,070 --> 04:17:11,010
He doesn't know.

6512
04:17:16,980 --> 04:17:17,700
There we go.

6513
04:17:19,760 --> 04:17:20,200
Nice.

6514
04:17:20,200 --> 04:17:21,080
Oh, not nice.

6515
04:17:22,240 --> 04:17:22,900
Not nice.

6516
04:17:23,960 --> 04:17:24,620
Not nice.

6517
04:17:24,700 --> 04:17:25,760
We're gonna use the shotgun.

6518
04:17:25,760 --> 04:17:28,860
Because apparently he can one-shot you.

6519
04:17:30,140 --> 04:17:30,880
There we go.

6520
04:17:32,200 --> 04:17:33,580
Wait, you're still alive?

6521
04:17:35,340 --> 04:17:37,520
Okay, it's pistol time.

6522
04:17:38,600 --> 04:17:40,800
Because I don't know if you have a head.

6523
04:17:41,280 --> 04:17:42,100
That's the thing.

6524
04:17:43,520 --> 04:17:44,900
Sometimes I don't know.

6525
04:17:50,900 --> 04:17:51,720
Oh God.

6526
04:17:51,800 --> 04:17:52,540
Okay, I can't.

6527
04:17:53,360 --> 04:17:53,900
Yeah!

6528
04:17:56,840 --> 04:17:57,380
Okay.

6529
04:17:59,220 --> 04:18:00,180
Okay, we're fine.

6530
04:18:00,260 --> 04:18:00,600
We're fine.

6531
04:18:02,460 --> 04:18:03,740
I think that's all of them.

6532
04:18:04,700 --> 04:18:05,260
We're good.

6533
04:18:06,020 --> 04:18:07,280
And he just gives me money.

6534
04:18:07,380 --> 04:18:07,780
Nice.

6535
04:18:10,160 --> 04:18:11,340
The mouth is the spot?

6536
04:18:11,520 --> 04:18:12,020
Oh, okay.

6537
04:18:12,520 --> 04:18:13,600
I couldn't tell!

6538
04:18:14,300 --> 04:18:16,860
It's so hard to see if he has a mouth!

6539
04:18:17,540 --> 04:18:18,640
Like, where's your head?

6540
04:18:19,300 --> 04:18:21,200
I couldn't tell where the head was.

6541
04:18:22,180 --> 04:18:23,260
It's too confusing.

6542
04:18:25,440 --> 04:18:27,860
Like, he was just all mouth, no head.

6543
04:18:29,640 --> 04:18:31,160
Okay, I need the thing.

6544
04:18:32,380 --> 04:18:33,260
It's a worm!

6545
04:18:33,420 --> 04:18:34,460
You can't kill a worm!

6546
04:18:34,840 --> 04:18:37,040
You can chop it, but you can't kill it.

6547
04:18:38,400 --> 04:18:41,120
Okay, got the wheel.

6548
04:18:46,400 --> 04:18:46,920
Okay.

6549
04:18:49,120 --> 04:18:49,920
Wheel time.

6550
04:18:54,770 --> 04:18:56,770
Yeah, we're... Why don't I have salt?

6551
04:18:57,010 --> 04:18:57,530
Salt.

6552
04:18:59,130 --> 04:19:01,530
If only I had the salt.

6553
04:19:01,830 --> 04:19:03,050
Who just...

6554
04:19:04,430 --> 04:19:06,570
That is exactly what I've been missing.

6555
04:19:08,270 --> 04:19:08,990
Where?

6556
04:19:10,630 --> 04:19:11,350
Oh!

6557
04:19:15,170 --> 04:19:15,890
There!

6558
04:19:21,720 --> 04:19:22,840
Please stop!

6559
04:19:24,980 --> 04:19:26,720
Son of a bitch.

6560
04:19:26,740 --> 04:19:27,200
Oh, God.

6561
04:19:27,520 --> 04:19:30,040
I don't have... Okay, it's time.

6562
04:19:31,040 --> 04:19:31,860
Okay, it's time.

6563
04:19:31,860 --> 04:19:35,280
I know I have the quick thing, but I'm too scared!

6564
04:19:39,020 --> 04:19:39,900
Oh, shit!

6565
04:19:40,320 --> 04:19:41,080
Fucking hell!

6566
04:19:42,180 --> 04:19:43,160
I'm gonna use this spray.

6567
04:19:44,260 --> 04:19:45,260
Ashley, come over here!

6568
04:19:45,380 --> 04:19:45,820
Ashley!

6569
04:19:45,920 --> 04:19:46,220
Ashley!

6570
04:19:46,360 --> 04:19:46,640
Ashley!

6571
04:19:46,720 --> 04:19:47,080
Ashley!

6572
04:19:47,180 --> 04:19:47,620
Ashley!

6573
04:19:47,860 --> 04:19:48,300
Ashley!

6574
04:19:48,300 --> 04:19:48,560
Ashley!

6575
04:19:48,740 --> 04:19:48,800
Ashley!

6576
04:19:48,820 --> 04:19:48,900
Ashley!

6577
04:19:49,180 --> 04:19:49,620
Okay.

6578
04:19:50,980 --> 04:19:51,420
Okay.

6579
04:19:52,080 --> 04:19:53,260
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

6580
04:19:53,940 --> 04:19:54,580
You got it.

6581
04:20:00,450 --> 04:20:00,890
Okay.

6582
04:20:01,770 --> 04:20:02,210
Oh!

6583
04:20:11,460 --> 04:20:12,940
Oh, he jumped in the air!

6584
04:20:13,020 --> 04:20:13,800
He jumped in the sky!

6585
04:20:14,780 --> 04:20:15,220
He

6586
04:20:19,860 --> 04:20:20,300
jumped in the sky!

6587
04:20:20,300 --> 04:20:20,420
He jumped down!

6588
04:20:20,420 --> 04:20:20,420
Ashley!

6589
04:20:20,420 --> 04:20:20,660
Ashley!

6590
04:20:20,840 --> 04:20:21,300
Ashley!

6591
04:20:21,560 --> 04:20:23,760
We gotta lead him to the explosive!

6592
04:20:23,760 --> 04:20:25,000
This is our only hope now!

6593
04:20:26,120 --> 04:20:28,720
I don't have a lot of ammo anymore!

6594
04:20:29,120 --> 04:20:30,420
I'm fucked up!

6595
04:20:37,270 --> 04:20:38,610
Please tell me he's dead...

6596
04:20:38,610 --> 04:20:39,570
He's not dead!

6597
04:20:40,610 --> 04:20:41,230
Ashley!

6598
04:20:42,150 --> 04:20:42,770
Ashley!

6599
04:20:42,870 --> 04:20:43,210
Ashley!

6600
04:20:43,250 --> 04:20:43,470
Ashley!

6601
04:20:45,670 --> 04:20:49,930
OK, here we go!

6602
04:20:50,090 --> 04:20:52,430
Wait, let me68 It's fine.

6603
04:20:52,710 --> 04:20:54,490
We're really poor right now.

6604
04:20:54,550 --> 04:20:55,470
But we're fine.

6605
04:20:56,390 --> 04:20:57,810
We live.

6606
04:20:59,770 --> 04:21:01,670
Oh my god.

6607
04:21:01,770 --> 04:21:02,450
We're okay.

6608
04:21:03,110 --> 04:21:05,050
We're very poor right now.

6609
04:21:05,070 --> 04:21:06,750
Our economy is in shambles.

6610
04:21:07,370 --> 04:21:08,590
But we are okay.

6611
04:21:08,650 --> 04:21:12,850
I'm not even gonna bother using my fucking sniper.

6612
04:21:16,150 --> 04:21:17,110
Oh my god.

6613
04:21:17,170 --> 04:21:17,990
Bro, really?

6614
04:21:18,130 --> 04:21:20,230
Bro, I'm just...

6615
04:21:20,230 --> 04:21:25,090
Bro, I do not need sniper ammo to kill you.

6616
04:21:26,250 --> 04:21:27,770
I can see your head.

6617
04:21:27,910 --> 04:21:29,350
OH MY GOD!

6618
04:21:31,670 --> 04:21:32,510
Bro, he...

6619
04:21:36,530 --> 04:21:37,410
Actually, please.

6620
04:21:37,830 --> 04:21:38,370
Please.

6621
04:21:38,790 --> 04:21:39,330
PLEASE!

6622
04:21:39,930 --> 04:21:40,570
Catch it!

6623
04:21:46,760 --> 04:21:47,560
Oh god.

6624
04:21:49,140 --> 04:21:50,220
Holy shit.

6625
04:21:50,400 --> 04:21:50,820
Okay.

6626
04:21:52,800 --> 04:21:53,400
We're fine.

6627
04:21:54,560 --> 04:21:55,300
It's fine.

6628
04:21:55,360 --> 04:21:56,260
We'll use the pistol.

6629
04:21:56,640 --> 04:21:58,320
We literally do not...

6630
04:21:58,440 --> 04:21:59,860
We don't need rifles for this.

6631
04:22:01,140 --> 04:22:02,800
Like, our aim is good enough.

6632
04:22:05,960 --> 04:22:07,320
Oh my god.

6633
04:22:07,340 --> 04:22:09,500
Please tell me I have enough to craft.

6634
04:22:09,720 --> 04:22:11,240
Okay, we need shotgun ammo.

6635
04:22:11,500 --> 04:22:12,500
We're so poor.

6636
04:22:12,680 --> 04:22:14,140
We're so poor.

6637
04:22:15,320 --> 04:22:17,280
I need yellow herbs!

6638
04:22:19,700 --> 04:22:20,800
Oh my god.

6639
04:22:20,860 --> 04:22:21,560
Okay, we're fine.

6640
04:22:26,090 --> 04:22:27,130
I think we're good.

6641
04:22:27,570 --> 04:22:29,010
I think we're good now.

6642
04:22:29,110 --> 04:22:29,790
I think...

6643
04:22:30,090 --> 04:22:31,110
I think we're okay.

6644
04:22:32,010 --> 04:22:34,010
Alright, time to use the wheel.

6645
04:22:34,210 --> 04:22:36,230
Time to use the wheel.

6646
04:22:39,650 --> 04:22:41,130
Oh my god.

6647
04:22:41,230 --> 04:22:42,950
We have nothing left!

6648
04:22:44,090 --> 04:22:44,690
Alright.

6649
04:22:44,690 --> 04:22:45,290
Awesome!

6650
04:22:45,390 --> 04:22:46,210
Yes, Ashley.

6651
04:22:46,230 --> 04:22:47,190
So awesome.

6652
04:22:47,530 --> 04:22:47,610
I don't have the bullets yet.

6653
04:22:48,470 --> 04:22:49,670
So awesome.

6654
04:22:50,230 --> 04:22:52,430
Guys, remember when I had 70 bullets?

6655
04:22:52,730 --> 04:22:53,610
I remember.

6656
04:22:58,310 --> 04:22:59,590
Okay, here we go.

6657
04:22:59,730 --> 04:23:00,070
Okay, here we go.

6658
04:23:01,310 --> 04:23:02,470
Oh my god.

6659
04:23:02,510 --> 04:23:03,450
Don't tell me there's more.

6660
04:23:03,510 --> 04:23:05,030
Don't tell me there's more.

6661
04:23:05,550 --> 04:23:08,450
Don't tell me there's more.

6662
04:23:09,230 --> 04:23:09,830
Don't tell me there's more.

6663
04:23:16,390 --> 04:23:18,570
The economy hit hard.

6664
04:23:21,990 --> 04:23:22,590
Hello?

6665
04:23:23,430 --> 04:23:24,830
Bro, this part fucking sucks.

6666
04:23:24,890 --> 04:23:25,710
I miss sniping.

6667
04:23:28,030 --> 04:23:29,110
We go back.

6668
04:23:29,450 --> 04:23:30,050
We go back.

6669
04:23:30,050 --> 04:23:31,710
We go back.

6670
04:23:31,710 --> 04:23:34,350
If we trigger somebody, we go back.

6671
04:23:34,470 --> 04:23:35,430
We go back.

6672
04:23:36,050 --> 04:23:40,310
We go back.

6673
04:23:40,310 --> 04:23:41,150
Oh no.

6674
04:23:41,650 --> 04:23:42,930
Oh no.

6675
04:23:42,970 --> 04:23:43,490
Oh no.

6676
04:23:45,170 --> 04:23:45,990
Bro.

6677
04:23:50,630 --> 04:23:51,450
God.

6678
04:23:51,630 --> 04:23:52,650
There's only resources?

6679
04:23:52,990 --> 04:23:56,490
What about the sniper ammo?!

6680
04:23:56,490 --> 04:23:56,510
What about the sniper ammo?!

6681
04:24:00,790 --> 04:24:01,370
Alright.

6682
04:24:06,140 --> 04:24:07,120
Alright, here we go.

6683
04:24:14,050 --> 04:24:15,590
Oh my god, it's like Mario.

6684
04:24:16,800 --> 04:24:17,790
It's just like Mario.

6685
04:24:19,070 --> 04:24:20,630
It's just like Mario.

6686
04:24:21,730 --> 04:24:24,010
Oh my god, I don't have enough ammo.

6687
04:24:24,150 --> 04:24:24,530
Please!

6688
04:24:28,280 --> 04:24:31,230
I don't know if I can protect you.

6689
04:24:31,230 --> 04:24:33,810
No, this is it.

6690
04:24:33,850 --> 04:24:35,950
This is the sniper area!

6691
04:24:37,510 --> 04:24:39,250
Okay, Ashley, here we go.

6692
04:24:47,450 --> 04:24:49,190
This is it.

6693
04:25:01,220 --> 04:25:01,540
Okay.

6694
04:25:02,700 --> 04:25:04,120
Don't have a lot.

6695
04:25:05,240 --> 04:25:06,280
But okay.

6696
04:25:09,800 --> 04:25:11,520
Oh shit, okay!

6697
04:25:19,000 --> 04:25:19,680
Alright.

6698
04:25:20,920 --> 04:25:21,600
Alright.

6699
04:25:27,740 --> 04:25:31,860
Oh my god, please Leon, you're not supposed to be missing right now.

6700
04:25:32,060 --> 04:25:33,580
Oh my god.

6701
04:25:33,780 --> 04:25:35,700
What do you want?!

6702
04:25:38,500 --> 04:25:40,440
What do you mean?!

6703
04:25:43,420 --> 04:25:44,060
Guys!

6704
04:25:46,080 --> 04:25:46,720
Chill!

6705
04:25:47,060 --> 04:25:48,280
Actually, chill!

6706
04:25:54,320 --> 04:25:55,680
Oh, thank you.

6707
04:26:00,950 --> 04:26:02,230
Oh my god, please.

6708
04:26:02,870 --> 04:26:03,510
Please.

6709
04:26:04,170 --> 04:26:07,070
I have to... PLEASE LET ME GO!

6710
04:26:18,860 --> 04:26:20,340
Oh my god, get down!

6711
04:26:20,480 --> 04:26:21,060
Get down!

6712
04:26:21,160 --> 04:26:22,080
Get down, Ashley!

6713
04:26:25,460 --> 04:26:26,980
Okay, I'm fucking...

6714
04:26:28,200 --> 04:26:30,040
Jesus, Chris, I'm gonna knife now.

6715
04:26:31,960 --> 04:26:33,320
Thank god.

6716
04:26:35,100 --> 04:26:37,480
I just had enough ammo.

6717
04:26:37,720 --> 04:26:40,940
I actually just got enough ammo.

6718
04:26:41,740 --> 04:26:43,280
Thank fucking god.

6719
04:26:43,480 --> 04:26:46,100
Look at me, I'm so fucking poor now.

6720
04:26:49,500 --> 04:26:50,940
Got a drop down.

6721
04:26:54,260 --> 04:26:55,980
Oh my god.

6722
04:26:56,600 --> 04:26:58,840
Okay, craft rifle ammo.

6723
04:26:59,620 --> 04:27:02,400
Because, by god, we need this shit!

6724
04:27:02,760 --> 04:27:03,480
Okay.

6725
04:27:06,560 --> 04:27:07,600
Don't say that.

6726
04:27:07,800 --> 04:27:09,700
Don't fucking say that.

6727
04:27:09,860 --> 04:27:12,620
I'm back in the lower tax bracket.

6728
04:27:15,100 --> 04:27:19,160
What am I gonna do with $95,000?!

6729
04:27:22,540 --> 04:27:23,740
Alright, here we go.

6730
04:27:25,760 --> 04:27:26,500
Here we go.

6731
04:27:26,520 --> 04:27:26,840
Nice.

6732
04:27:27,760 --> 04:27:28,720
We made it.

6733
04:27:28,900 --> 04:27:30,360
Red Hood, thank you for the super chat.

6734
04:27:30,460 --> 04:27:31,240
Thank you, thank you.

6735
04:27:31,940 --> 04:27:32,620
Okay, Ashley.

6736
04:27:33,580 --> 04:27:34,220
You're close.

6737
04:27:34,620 --> 04:27:35,100
Okay.

6738
04:27:35,380 --> 04:27:35,860
Alright.

6739
04:27:40,190 --> 04:27:40,950
Thank you.

6740
04:27:41,950 --> 04:27:43,330
Oh, thank god, there's boxes.

6741
04:27:44,850 --> 04:27:47,370
Your guns demand funds.

6742
04:27:47,770 --> 04:27:49,990
Why can't I just buy ammo?!

6743
04:27:51,590 --> 04:27:54,910
This is exactly why we're not doing the harder difficulty.

6744
04:27:55,150 --> 04:27:57,470
I would have been softlocked.

6745
04:27:58,670 --> 04:27:59,230
100%.

6746
04:27:59,230 --> 04:28:02,090
I would have been fucking softlocked.

6747
04:28:04,450 --> 04:28:05,590
Okay, let's see.

6748
04:28:13,060 --> 04:28:13,780
Wait, what?

6749
04:28:14,540 --> 04:28:15,280
Open up.

6750
04:28:15,920 --> 04:28:16,680
Wait, what?

6751
04:28:17,280 --> 04:28:18,120
What do you mean?

6752
04:28:20,000 --> 04:28:21,220
What the fuck do you mean?

6753
04:28:21,960 --> 04:28:23,520
There's a gap in the wall?

6754
04:28:23,520 --> 04:28:24,160
Ashley!

6755
04:28:25,380 --> 04:28:27,120
God, open up for me, Ashley.

6756
04:28:28,960 --> 04:28:30,440
Robert, thank you for the super chat!

6757
04:28:30,600 --> 04:28:31,040
Thank you, thank you!

6758
04:28:34,440 --> 04:28:35,280
Alright, here we go.

6759
04:28:39,660 --> 04:28:41,280
I found more shotgun ammo, nice.

6760
04:28:46,250 --> 04:28:47,370
Ashley, cough later.

6761
04:28:47,550 --> 04:28:48,070
Open the door.

6762
04:28:51,150 --> 04:28:51,590
Please.

6763
04:28:51,590 --> 04:28:52,030
Please.

6764
04:28:55,350 --> 04:28:55,790
Okay.

6765
04:28:56,630 --> 04:28:57,350
We're okay.

6766
04:28:58,850 --> 04:28:59,630
Everything is fine.

6767
04:29:03,130 --> 04:29:03,890
Ashley, look.

6768
04:29:03,990 --> 04:29:05,470
I'm not coughing, Ashley.

6769
04:29:05,610 --> 04:29:06,010
Come on.

6770
04:29:06,270 --> 04:29:07,370
Looks like the right place.

6771
04:29:09,630 --> 04:29:10,470
What's going on?

6772
04:29:11,070 --> 04:29:12,350
Are you feeling the scene?

6773
04:29:14,250 --> 04:29:15,790
What's the inner scene kid saying?

6774
04:29:17,410 --> 04:29:21,050
Instead of worrying about her, worry about your own skin.

6775
04:29:22,670 --> 04:29:23,190
What?

6776
04:29:24,710 --> 04:29:26,630
Oh, they're controlling me!

6777
04:29:27,110 --> 04:29:28,610
Or he's controlling her.

6778
04:29:29,470 --> 04:29:30,790
I'm a prince child.

6779
04:29:31,190 --> 04:29:32,530
I'm a child.

6780
04:29:35,880 --> 04:29:36,720
Ashley, please.

6781
04:29:37,280 --> 04:29:39,120
Please, no more of your scene roleplay.

6782
04:29:44,540 --> 04:29:45,840
Ashley, give me my knife.

6783
04:29:45,880 --> 04:29:47,040
That cost like $30,000.

6784
04:29:48,980 --> 04:29:49,500
Ashley.

6785
04:29:49,700 --> 04:29:52,640
Ashley, my knife is more expensive than you!

6786
04:29:52,980 --> 04:29:53,520
Oh, man!

6787
04:29:56,720 --> 04:29:57,240
Ashley,

6788
04:30:00,640 --> 04:30:00,920
please.

6789
04:30:01,840 --> 04:30:03,220
She's got emo.

6790
04:30:03,260 --> 04:30:03,700
No!

6791
04:30:03,920 --> 04:30:05,660
You're supposed to be seen!

6792
04:30:06,220 --> 04:30:07,220
Not emo!

6793
04:30:09,740 --> 04:30:11,640
It's not just a phase.

6794
04:30:14,760 --> 04:30:15,840
Wait, where are we at?

6795
04:30:16,000 --> 04:30:17,340
Okay, we're starting chapter 8 now.

6796
04:30:19,900 --> 04:30:20,540
Oh, wait.

6797
04:30:20,540 --> 04:30:22,960
We've never seen our chapter results.

6798
04:30:23,220 --> 04:30:23,540
No!

6799
04:30:23,680 --> 04:30:24,380
Look at that!

6800
04:30:24,500 --> 04:30:26,080
That's almost 90%.

6801
04:30:26,800 --> 04:30:28,660
That's almost 90%.

6802
04:30:28,660 --> 04:30:28,780
That's it.

6803
04:30:32,450 --> 04:30:33,290
Roost, come in.

6804
04:30:33,450 --> 04:30:34,610
Things went to shit.

6805
04:30:34,830 --> 04:30:36,630
We took refuge inside a castle.

6806
04:30:36,790 --> 04:30:38,390
These moons, they will not hear.

6807
04:30:39,390 --> 04:30:40,130
Say it.

6808
04:30:41,510 --> 04:30:42,990
Roost, you're breaking up.

6809
04:30:43,130 --> 04:30:44,030
Do you read me?

6810
04:30:44,110 --> 04:30:44,450
Roost!

6811
04:30:44,650 --> 04:30:45,090
Hello!

6812
04:30:45,750 --> 04:30:46,270
Roost!

6813
04:30:47,690 --> 04:30:48,770
I lost her!

6814
04:30:48,870 --> 04:30:49,870
And she lost my knife!

6815
04:30:50,850 --> 04:30:51,530
Damn it!

6816
04:30:51,870 --> 04:30:52,910
So much for that.

6817
04:30:56,420 --> 04:30:57,340
My knife.

6818
04:30:57,340 --> 04:30:58,500
Wait, this is...

6819
04:30:58,500 --> 04:30:59,560
Oh, I got my knife back.

6820
04:30:59,680 --> 04:31:00,280
Okay, that's good.

6821
04:31:00,360 --> 04:31:00,720
That's alright.

6822
04:31:00,880 --> 04:31:01,680
I don't give a fuck.

6823
04:31:01,960 --> 04:31:02,980
I got my knife.

6824
04:31:03,880 --> 04:31:04,760
It's alright, guys.

6825
04:31:04,880 --> 04:31:06,120
My knife is still with me.

6826
04:31:07,420 --> 04:31:10,060
It took me so long to find her.

6827
04:31:10,920 --> 04:31:12,720
And now I have to try and find her again.

6828
04:31:16,120 --> 04:31:17,040
Wait, what's over here?

6829
04:31:19,780 --> 04:31:20,180
Huh?

6830
04:31:20,320 --> 04:31:23,780
I feel like there would be something here because there's a fountain and a courtyard.

6831
04:31:24,680 --> 04:31:25,480
The fish!

6832
04:31:27,400 --> 04:31:29,200
I'm gonna eat the fish!

6833
04:31:30,040 --> 04:31:31,000
Eat the rich.

6834
04:31:34,780 --> 04:31:36,300
That's why there's a fountain!

6835
04:31:36,560 --> 04:31:37,420
I knew it.

6836
04:31:37,440 --> 04:31:39,820
I knew there's a fountain here for a reason.

6837
04:31:40,380 --> 04:31:41,780
I knew it.

6838
04:31:42,780 --> 04:31:43,300
Nice.

6839
04:31:43,340 --> 04:31:44,100
Now I have food.

6840
04:31:44,440 --> 04:31:45,920
Okay, now I have fish.

6841
04:31:46,060 --> 04:31:46,260
Good.

6842
04:31:46,780 --> 04:31:48,020
Okay, this is a mess.

6843
04:31:48,120 --> 04:31:48,780
Give me a second.

6844
04:31:48,900 --> 04:31:50,100
This is a mess.

6845
04:31:51,320 --> 04:31:51,840
Okay.

6846
04:31:52,200 --> 04:31:55,860
Let us sort this out real fast.

6847
04:31:56,120 --> 04:31:57,220
No, I'm not kitchen knife.

6848
04:31:57,340 --> 04:31:57,680
The fish are gone.

6849
04:31:59,100 --> 04:32:02,600
God, I have so many resources but no fucking gunpowder.

6850
04:32:03,160 --> 04:32:04,140
This is sad.

6851
04:32:05,780 --> 04:32:06,620
Okay, nice.

6852
04:32:06,800 --> 04:32:06,980
Alright.

6853
04:32:07,900 --> 04:32:09,640
A little snack for me.

6854
04:32:10,540 --> 04:32:13,480
I really need it because I wasted so much money.

6855
04:32:13,820 --> 04:32:15,720
I wasted all my heals.

6856
04:32:17,120 --> 04:32:18,640
Oh yeah, super rough, man.

6857
04:32:19,160 --> 04:32:20,380
Do you have anything new?

6858
04:32:24,960 --> 04:32:25,520
Matilda...

6859
04:32:26,340 --> 04:32:26,900
scope...

6860
04:32:28,940 --> 04:32:30,060
None of these are good.

6861
04:32:32,620 --> 04:32:34,300
Wait, is there the box upgrade?

6862
04:32:34,700 --> 04:32:35,800
Body armor!

6863
04:32:39,280 --> 04:32:40,680
This is good!

6864
04:32:41,480 --> 04:32:42,040
Nice.

6865
04:32:42,240 --> 04:32:44,060
Okay, we needed that actually.

6866
04:32:44,960 --> 04:32:45,700
Let's see.

6867
04:32:46,320 --> 04:32:48,680
Stingray... Okay, we don't need any of this.

6868
04:32:49,160 --> 04:32:52,560
Alright, we have Oh yeah, we should get the yellow herb.

6869
04:32:52,660 --> 04:32:53,300
We might as well.

6870
04:32:53,840 --> 04:32:55,000
I feel like we should.

6871
04:32:56,220 --> 04:32:57,280
Okay, let's see.

6872
04:32:57,420 --> 04:32:58,700
Do I have enough gems?

6873
04:32:59,100 --> 04:32:59,460
No.

6874
04:33:01,080 --> 04:33:02,900
Don't... Okay, I can sell this.

6875
04:33:03,000 --> 04:33:04,920
I still don't have a submachine gun.

6876
04:33:05,260 --> 04:33:06,560
So I can sell that.

6877
04:33:07,100 --> 04:33:08,100
And then...

6878
04:33:08,620 --> 04:33:10,100
Anything else should be good.

6879
04:33:11,200 --> 04:33:11,680
Oh!

6880
04:33:13,020 --> 04:33:14,340
Inflation is hitting hard, man.

6881
04:33:14,860 --> 04:33:15,340
Hahaha!

6882
04:33:17,680 --> 04:33:18,820
Alright, we're good.

6883
04:33:19,340 --> 04:33:20,360
We're good to go.

6884
04:33:20,380 --> 04:33:23,660
Wait, can I upgrade my body armor?

6885
04:33:26,180 --> 04:33:26,660
Can I?

6886
04:33:26,820 --> 04:33:27,920
No, I can repair it.

6887
04:33:28,120 --> 04:33:29,560
Alright, let's see.

6888
04:33:30,880 --> 04:33:32,160
Reload speed...

6889
04:33:32,160 --> 04:33:34,380
Rate of fire...

6890
04:33:36,380 --> 04:33:37,100
Uhhhh...

6891
04:33:37,100 --> 04:33:38,600
Ammo capacity...

6892
04:33:38,600 --> 04:33:40,560
I feel like...

6893
04:33:40,560 --> 04:33:43,880
All those weapons to finish!

6894
04:33:44,840 --> 04:33:46,580
That's all we need!

6895
04:33:47,540 --> 04:33:48,260
Hahaha!

6896
04:33:50,380 --> 04:33:52,980
Ammo capacity for my pistol.

6897
04:33:53,120 --> 04:33:53,820
I might as well.

6898
04:33:54,480 --> 04:33:55,160
Hahaha!

6899
04:33:56,940 --> 04:33:59,560
We don't need the rifle fire rate!

6900
04:33:59,700 --> 04:34:01,180
We're so fucking healthy!

6901
04:34:02,280 --> 04:34:03,800
We don't need it!

6902
04:34:03,880 --> 04:34:05,040
I hit my shots!

6903
04:34:05,420 --> 04:34:05,800
Hahaha!

6904
04:34:07,340 --> 04:34:08,020
Hahaha!

6905
04:34:10,700 --> 04:34:12,060
We're so...

6906
04:34:12,060 --> 04:34:13,040
We're okay.

6907
04:34:14,080 --> 04:34:15,440
We'll be fine.

6908
04:34:15,540 --> 04:34:16,800
Okay, fine, fine.

6909
04:34:17,040 --> 04:34:18,620
Fine, I'll do reload speed.

6910
04:34:20,380 --> 04:34:22,020
We're a bug on the back wall?

6911
04:34:22,320 --> 04:34:22,840
What?

6912
04:34:24,640 --> 04:34:25,900
What about the bug?

6913
04:34:30,100 --> 04:34:32,540
What about the bug on the back wall?

6914
04:34:33,220 --> 04:34:34,220
What about it?

6915
04:34:35,200 --> 04:34:35,760
What?

6916
04:34:36,480 --> 04:34:37,360
What do you mean?

6917
04:34:37,640 --> 04:34:38,480
There's nothing here.

6918
04:34:39,640 --> 04:34:40,200
Oh!

6919
04:34:40,380 --> 04:34:41,360
On the fountain!

6920
04:34:46,360 --> 04:34:47,080
There's a...

6921
04:34:47,080 --> 04:34:48,460
There's a bug?

6922
04:34:51,780 --> 04:34:52,340
Whoa!

6923
04:34:52,340 --> 04:34:53,280
What the fuck?

6924
04:34:53,540 --> 04:34:54,080
What was that?

6925
04:34:57,440 --> 04:34:58,620
What the fuck was that?

6926
04:35:02,980 --> 04:35:03,940
What the fuck?

6927
04:35:03,980 --> 04:35:04,700
Did you guys see that?

6928
04:35:05,900 --> 04:35:07,280
Left side... Oh, hey!

6929
04:35:07,500 --> 04:35:08,580
Oh, there's a beetle!

6930
04:35:10,120 --> 04:35:12,740
There he... I thought you meant like... Game bug.

6931
04:35:13,180 --> 04:35:13,540
Hahaha!

6932
04:35:14,840 --> 04:35:15,320
Hahaha!

6933
04:35:15,700 --> 04:35:20,000
I thought that's what you meant because my graphics started glitching.

6934
04:35:20,300 --> 04:35:20,780
Hahaha!

6935
04:35:21,820 --> 04:35:22,920
I was like, whoa!

6936
04:35:22,920 --> 04:35:23,920
You're right!

6937
04:35:24,660 --> 04:35:25,200
Hahaha!

6938
04:35:26,260 --> 04:35:28,180
I was like, whoa guys!

6939
04:35:28,340 --> 04:35:28,880
You're right!

6940
04:35:28,960 --> 04:35:30,000
There is a bug!

6941
04:35:31,460 --> 04:35:32,000
Hahaha!

6942
04:35:32,680 --> 04:35:32,780
Hahaha!

6943
04:35:34,800 --> 04:35:36,060
Okay, here we go.

6944
04:35:36,440 --> 04:35:37,760
Um, time to sell!

6945
04:35:38,040 --> 04:35:38,760
Is this for selling?

6946
04:35:38,760 --> 04:35:39,000
Right?

6947
04:35:39,160 --> 04:35:39,520
Yeah.

6948
04:35:39,900 --> 04:35:41,480
I'm pretty sure it's for selling.

6949
04:35:44,960 --> 04:35:45,500
Hahaha!

6950
04:35:45,540 --> 04:35:47,240
That was the fence.

6951
04:35:49,060 --> 04:35:49,600
Hahaha!

6952
04:35:49,620 --> 04:35:50,600
Yeah, I thought...

6953
04:35:50,600 --> 04:35:52,880
I thought like the game was broken.

6954
04:35:56,100 --> 04:35:57,340
Wait, now eat it?

6955
04:35:57,780 --> 04:35:59,020
Oh, well too late.

6956
04:35:59,080 --> 04:35:59,600
I sold it.

6957
04:35:59,640 --> 04:36:00,720
I care about money more.

6958
04:36:01,500 --> 04:36:01,980
Hahaha!

6959
04:36:02,240 --> 04:36:02,720
Hahaha!

6960
04:36:06,240 --> 04:36:06,720
Whoops!

6961
04:36:07,320 --> 04:36:07,800
Hahaha!

6962
04:36:07,800 --> 04:36:08,460
I ate.

6963
04:36:08,540 --> 04:36:08,820
I ate.

6964
04:36:08,840 --> 04:36:10,140
I sold it.

6965
04:36:11,080 --> 04:36:13,300
Sorry, money was more important, guys.

6966
04:36:13,520 --> 04:36:13,740
Hahaha!

6967
04:36:19,520 --> 04:36:20,740
Alright, here we go.

6968
04:36:22,320 --> 04:36:22,960
Whoo!

6969
04:36:24,320 --> 04:36:25,400
Oh no!

6970
04:36:25,560 --> 04:36:26,140
Wait, what?

6971
04:36:27,040 --> 04:36:28,580
Are these guys dead already?

6972
04:36:28,920 --> 04:36:29,900
Oh, they are.

6973
04:36:31,600 --> 04:36:33,160
This is messed up.

6974
04:36:33,860 --> 04:36:35,380
Oh, what the fuck?

6975
04:36:36,680 --> 04:36:37,840
Are they all dead?

6976
04:36:38,160 --> 04:36:38,680
Oh, yeah!

6977
04:36:38,760 --> 04:36:40,060
They are definitely all dead.

6978
04:36:40,580 --> 04:36:41,220
Yeah.

6979
04:36:42,380 --> 04:36:43,560
I gotta go.

6980
04:36:44,820 --> 04:36:45,900
What's this way?

6981
04:36:51,340 --> 04:36:51,980
Oh!

6982
04:36:51,980 --> 04:36:53,380
I remember this!

6983
04:36:57,480 --> 04:37:01,580
Okay, I'm gonna try and...

6984
04:37:03,140 --> 04:37:04,240
I just sniped in?

6985
04:37:09,640 --> 04:37:12,040
Wait, do I go from here?

6986
04:37:14,520 --> 04:37:15,760
I'm so confused.

6987
04:37:16,140 --> 04:37:17,720
I don't see them down there.

6988
04:37:18,660 --> 04:37:19,220
See?

6989
04:37:20,420 --> 04:37:21,920
I don't think I should.

6990
04:37:22,100 --> 04:37:23,340
I don't think I should.

6991
04:37:24,200 --> 04:37:25,620
Are you scared?

6992
04:37:25,660 --> 04:37:26,220
Yes!

6993
04:37:26,580 --> 04:37:27,000
Hahaha!

6994
04:37:27,560 --> 04:37:28,720
I'm scared.

6995
04:37:29,980 --> 04:37:32,520
When you meet Emma, Yes, I am!

6996
04:37:32,900 --> 04:37:35,280
What are you... How is that a question?

6997
04:37:36,400 --> 04:37:37,000
Hahaha!

6998
04:37:39,020 --> 04:37:39,620
Hahaha!

6999
04:37:41,880 --> 04:37:44,380
Alright, for one Akasupa, I'll vault over.

7000
04:37:44,600 --> 04:37:45,360
That's right.

7001
04:37:45,540 --> 04:37:46,000
Hahaha!

7002
04:37:48,460 --> 04:37:50,460
Yes, I'm testing you all.

7003
04:37:50,840 --> 04:37:51,440
Hahaha!

7004
04:37:52,020 --> 04:37:52,180
Hahaha!

7005
04:37:55,280 --> 04:37:55,740
That's right.

7006
04:37:55,800 --> 04:37:58,140
Put the money where your mouth is.

7007
04:37:58,140 --> 04:37:59,060
Hahaha!

7008
04:38:00,000 --> 04:38:01,320
That's okay, right?

7009
04:38:02,120 --> 04:38:02,640
Hahaha!

7010
04:38:03,000 --> 04:38:04,240
The bribe!

7011
04:38:04,540 --> 04:38:05,320
That's right.

7012
04:38:05,400 --> 04:38:07,980
That is why I'm not vaulting over.

7013
04:38:08,580 --> 04:38:09,100
Hahaha!

7014
04:38:10,460 --> 04:38:11,240
Oh, okay.

7015
04:38:11,340 --> 04:38:11,920
I'm doing it.

7016
04:38:11,980 --> 04:38:13,320
Okay, Bacon, thank you for the Akasupa.

7017
04:38:13,560 --> 04:38:14,760
Thank you, thank you.

7018
04:38:14,800 --> 04:38:15,800
Alright, here we go.

7019
04:38:17,440 --> 04:38:18,540
Oh, it was fine.

7020
04:38:18,820 --> 04:38:19,340
Hahaha!

7021
04:38:20,700 --> 04:38:22,700
There was nothing to worry about.

7022
04:38:23,100 --> 04:38:23,620
Alright.

7023
04:38:23,780 --> 04:38:26,200
The voice of... Thank you for the...

7024
04:38:26,200 --> 04:38:26,720
Thank you.

7025
04:38:27,060 --> 04:38:28,060
$100 well spent.

7026
04:38:28,140 --> 04:38:31,300
The voice of pestilence dwells.

7027
04:38:31,300 --> 04:38:32,740
Do it, you coward!

7028
04:38:33,620 --> 04:38:33,620
Hahaha!

7029
04:38:34,580 --> 04:38:36,780
Thank you for the Akasupa.

7030
04:38:36,960 --> 04:38:37,360
Thank you.

7031
04:38:37,760 --> 04:38:43,820
The voice of pestilence dwells in the flames, leading the pitiful souls to salvation.

7032
04:38:44,700 --> 04:38:49,440
Consign the crimson flame to its rightful place, where you shall be welcome to capitalism!

7033
04:38:51,960 --> 04:38:52,600
Welcome!

7034
04:38:53,780 --> 04:38:55,380
What if I just shoot him?

7035
04:38:58,140 --> 04:38:59,040
Can I just shoot him?

7036
04:38:59,280 --> 04:39:00,120
I'm gonna do it.

7037
04:39:00,140 --> 04:39:00,800
Do I take the shot?

7038
04:39:01,300 --> 04:39:02,820
Guys, I'm gonna take the shot!

7039
04:39:03,880 --> 04:39:06,320
This is like Sniper Elite, where you can shoot...

7040
04:39:06,320 --> 04:39:08,060
shoot somebody in the balls.

7041
04:39:11,380 --> 04:39:11,980
Do it!

7042
04:39:12,360 --> 04:39:13,220
Sorry to interrupt.

7043
04:39:14,320 --> 04:39:15,060
Oh, ow.

7044
04:39:15,380 --> 04:39:16,320
Should I have done that?

7045
04:39:17,100 --> 04:39:17,840
Oh, shit.

7046
04:39:17,880 --> 04:39:19,060
Maybe I shouldn't have.

7047
04:39:21,200 --> 04:39:24,480
Guys, guys, guys, I might have made a mistake, guys!

7048
04:39:25,920 --> 04:39:27,920
I might have made a mistake, guys!

7049
04:39:28,140 --> 04:39:28,740
Oh, this is it!

7050
04:39:28,780 --> 04:39:29,180
This is it!

7051
04:39:33,390 --> 04:39:34,190
This is it!

7052
04:39:40,220 --> 04:39:41,000
Okay, nice.

7053
04:39:43,480 --> 04:39:44,840
Alright, don't worry, I got the kick!

7054
04:39:45,340 --> 04:39:46,000
Oh, shit!

7055
04:39:46,080 --> 04:39:47,240
Don't worry, I got another grenade!

7056
04:39:48,900 --> 04:39:49,780
Another grenade!

7057
04:39:50,380 --> 04:39:50,820
Boom.

7058
04:39:51,160 --> 04:39:51,600
Ow.

7059
04:39:52,660 --> 04:39:53,340
It's okay.

7060
04:39:53,460 --> 04:39:54,420
That did nothing.

7061
04:39:56,060 --> 04:39:57,180
That did nothing.

7062
04:40:01,200 --> 04:40:01,640
Okay.

7063
04:40:01,640 --> 04:40:02,080
Whoa!

7064
04:40:03,360 --> 04:40:03,800
Whoa!

7065
04:40:03,880 --> 04:40:04,900
You're still alive?

7066
04:40:05,840 --> 04:40:06,600
Made it!

7067
04:40:07,340 --> 04:40:08,280
Not anymore.

7068
04:40:08,560 --> 04:40:08,820
Oh!

7069
04:40:11,240 --> 04:40:12,440
Okay, this is not good.

7070
04:40:13,000 --> 04:40:14,040
This is not good.

7071
04:40:14,760 --> 04:40:16,020
Guys, this is not good.

7072
04:40:16,100 --> 04:40:16,660
I don't know.

7073
04:40:17,660 --> 04:40:20,440
I feel like this is not a good time.

7074
04:40:20,740 --> 04:40:21,600
Oh, shit!

7075
04:40:21,700 --> 04:40:22,700
Oh, my god!

7076
04:40:22,900 --> 04:40:24,940
Guys, I ran out of grenade.

7077
04:40:26,440 --> 04:40:29,020
Does it look like I have a flash grenade?

7078
04:40:30,720 --> 04:40:34,480
Guys, I know you guys want me to use a flash grenade.

7079
04:40:39,660 --> 04:40:41,000
Guys, oh, I do!

7080
04:40:41,140 --> 04:40:41,660
I do!

7081
04:40:41,860 --> 04:40:42,840
Oh, my god, it's time.

7082
04:40:43,660 --> 04:40:44,400
It's time.

7083
04:40:44,940 --> 04:40:45,740
This is it.

7084
04:40:47,280 --> 04:40:48,160
This is it!

7085
04:40:52,530 --> 04:40:54,010
Oh, my god!

7086
04:40:54,350 --> 04:40:56,070
This is very unlucky.

7087
04:41:02,300 --> 04:41:04,380
This is very unlucky!

7088
04:41:05,060 --> 04:41:05,320
Billy!

7089
04:41:06,260 --> 04:41:07,140
Triple kill!

7090
04:41:09,380 --> 04:41:10,380
Oh, no!

7091
04:41:10,520 --> 04:41:11,020
Oh, no!

7092
04:41:14,120 --> 04:41:14,960
Okay, it's fine.

7093
04:41:15,280 --> 04:41:16,600
Oh, my god, he just got it.

7094
04:41:18,080 --> 04:41:18,600
It's fine.

7095
04:41:20,680 --> 04:41:21,280
It's fine.

7096
04:41:21,760 --> 04:41:23,080
You can't get closer to me.

7097
04:41:23,880 --> 04:41:24,540
It's okay.

7098
04:41:25,740 --> 04:41:26,540
He's burning!

7099
04:41:27,920 --> 04:41:28,720
Oh, no!

7100
04:41:28,860 --> 04:41:30,260
Oh, no, not the one shot!

7101
04:41:33,160 --> 04:41:33,560
Oh!

7102
04:41:34,740 --> 04:41:35,880
Use a shotgun!

7103
04:41:37,480 --> 04:41:38,720
Bro, I don't have it!

7104
04:41:47,200 --> 04:41:48,740
This is not...

7105
04:41:48,740 --> 04:41:50,380
not a good thing, Leon.

7106
04:41:50,900 --> 04:41:52,840
We're super fucked up right now.

7107
04:41:53,200 --> 04:41:55,120
Super fucked up.

7108
04:41:55,680 --> 04:41:57,140
There's no hot air.

7109
04:41:57,760 --> 04:41:59,700
So he's thanking for the magenta soup.

7110
04:41:59,780 --> 04:42:01,280
Thank you, thank you.

7111
04:42:02,160 --> 04:42:03,160
Where is he?

7112
04:42:03,680 --> 04:42:05,400
Oh, what the fuck?

7113
04:42:05,440 --> 04:42:06,720
Why is he still here?

7114
04:42:08,740 --> 04:42:10,220
Oh, my god.

7115
04:42:16,070 --> 04:42:17,470
Okay, where's the red guy?

7116
04:42:20,370 --> 04:42:21,430
Is that the red guy?

7117
04:42:21,610 --> 04:42:22,590
Is that the red guy?

7118
04:42:22,610 --> 04:42:23,590
I can't tell.

7119
04:42:24,690 --> 04:42:25,590
Where is he?

7120
04:42:27,990 --> 04:42:28,950
Where is the king?

7121
04:42:30,510 --> 04:42:31,450
Where is the king?

7122
04:42:35,370 --> 04:42:36,410
Where is the king?

7123
04:42:36,650 --> 04:42:37,370
Where is the king of all of this?

7124
04:42:40,270 --> 04:42:41,650
Bro, I'm just gonna fucking...

7125
04:42:42,710 --> 04:42:43,150
Ow!

7126
04:42:43,890 --> 04:42:44,870
Okay, I can't dodge that.

7127
04:42:44,910 --> 04:42:45,310
I can't...

7128
04:42:52,380 --> 04:42:53,260
I can't...

7129
04:42:53,760 --> 04:42:55,600
I can't...

7130
04:42:55,600 --> 04:42:56,700
Where...

7131
04:43:02,620 --> 04:43:03,540
There we go.

7132
04:43:05,300 --> 04:43:06,020
That's it.

7133
04:43:07,380 --> 04:43:08,160
That's it.

7134
04:43:08,380 --> 04:43:09,020
Okay.

7135
04:43:11,880 --> 04:43:13,000
Oh, what?

7136
04:43:13,120 --> 04:43:14,740
Oh, what a waste.

7137
04:43:15,260 --> 04:43:17,420
What a fucking waste.

7138
04:43:17,480 --> 04:43:18,580
That's for sure.

7139
04:43:19,540 --> 04:43:19,860
Okay.

7140
04:43:24,420 --> 04:43:26,080
Run, run, run, run.

7141
04:43:26,180 --> 04:43:27,700
Run, run, run, run, run.

7142
04:43:30,760 --> 04:43:32,760
Run, run, run, run, run.

7143
04:43:32,760 --> 04:43:33,460
Run, run, run, run, run, run.

7144
04:43:33,460 --> 04:43:34,320
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

7145
04:43:34,340 --> 04:43:34,860
...

7146
04:43:43,700 --> 04:43:45,240
London is calling.

7147
04:43:48,420 --> 04:43:52,060
Guys, that was the only way.

7148
04:43:52,380 --> 04:43:53,860
Dux, thank you for the super chat.

7149
04:43:54,020 --> 04:43:54,400
Thank you.

7150
04:43:54,420 --> 04:43:55,020
Thank you.

7151
04:43:56,180 --> 04:43:57,420
It was the only way.

7152
04:43:57,900 --> 04:43:59,120
What else was there?

7153
04:43:59,160 --> 04:44:01,560
I'm so scared I'm gonna accidentally kick the barrel.

7154
04:44:01,980 --> 04:44:04,900
I'm gonna wanna kick the barrel so I'm just gonna shoot it from here.

7155
04:44:06,260 --> 04:44:08,640
Guys, I was scared I was gonna kick the barrel!

7156
04:44:08,880 --> 04:44:10,260
It was understandable!

7157
04:44:12,080 --> 04:44:14,260
I'm stupid enough to do it!

7158
04:44:16,000 --> 04:44:18,800
I truly see no other way.

7159
04:44:21,320 --> 04:44:22,280
Alright, here we go.

7160
04:44:22,560 --> 04:44:23,900
Oh nice, loot!

7161
04:44:26,300 --> 04:44:28,520
Look at that, we killed so many people.

7162
04:44:30,860 --> 04:44:32,960
Yeah, but what if I knifed a barrel?

7163
04:44:35,400 --> 04:44:37,760
I could have knifed a barrel, guys!

7164
04:44:41,860 --> 04:44:43,420
Bro, I could have like...

7165
04:44:43,420 --> 04:44:46,240
stealthed that and killed everybody with the chandelier.

7166
04:44:46,440 --> 04:44:48,460
I just realized I could have...

7167
04:44:48,460 --> 04:44:49,160
I could have!

7168
04:44:50,820 --> 04:44:53,240
Guys, I just realized...

7169
04:44:53,240 --> 04:44:55,460
I could have saved so much ammo.

7170
04:44:56,180 --> 04:44:57,200
If I just...

7171
04:44:57,980 --> 04:45:01,900
If I just stealthed and got to the chandelier.

7172
04:45:03,220 --> 04:45:05,060
Why did I do this to myself?

7173
04:45:06,360 --> 04:45:08,320
I can share hindsight.

7174
04:45:10,340 --> 04:45:10,980
Yeah.

7175
04:45:11,500 --> 04:45:12,660
No way!

7176
04:45:13,820 --> 04:45:14,460
Guys...

7177
04:45:14,460 --> 04:45:15,420
Guys...

7178
04:45:15,420 --> 04:45:16,420
I think...

7179
04:45:16,420 --> 04:45:17,640
I think I messed up.

7180
04:45:23,590 --> 04:45:25,690
Alright, but it won't be as...

7181
04:45:25,690 --> 04:45:27,390
Guys, this is not a stealth run.

7182
04:45:29,430 --> 04:45:29,970
Chat...

7183
04:45:29,970 --> 04:45:31,770
We're not pussies here.

7184
04:45:34,050 --> 04:45:34,590
Guys...

7185
04:45:36,910 --> 04:45:38,890
We're not cowards!

7186
04:45:40,250 --> 04:45:41,070
There's like...

7187
04:45:41,070 --> 04:45:41,990
money here.

7188
04:45:42,070 --> 04:45:43,930
I'm trying to like figure out where the f**k the money is.

7189
04:45:44,490 --> 04:45:45,350
Like here.

7190
04:45:47,210 --> 04:45:48,150
It's like here.

7191
04:45:48,370 --> 04:45:50,230
This is the Doki Run, exactly.

7192
04:45:50,970 --> 04:45:52,510
Doki Run is all murder.

7193
04:45:54,550 --> 04:45:56,270
Oh, I just missed money here.

7194
04:45:56,970 --> 04:45:59,630
The Doki Run is just purely murder.

7195
04:46:02,170 --> 04:46:02,650
Okay.

7196
04:46:03,670 --> 04:46:06,930
The Doki Run is also trying to f**king figure out where to go.

7197
04:46:08,970 --> 04:46:10,630
Oh, it's like where I killed that guy.

7198
04:46:10,710 --> 04:46:11,170
It's right here.

7199
04:46:13,750 --> 04:46:14,490
Right here.

7200
04:46:17,010 --> 04:46:17,730
Wait, no.

7201
04:46:17,850 --> 04:46:18,810
It's not right here.

7202
04:46:19,630 --> 04:46:20,870
What the f**k?

7203
04:46:25,860 --> 04:46:26,600
Oh, no.

7204
04:46:26,640 --> 04:46:27,000
Where...

7205
04:46:27,000 --> 04:46:28,680
Where do I go?

7206
04:46:28,680 --> 04:46:29,740
Oh, ho, ho, ho!

7207
04:46:33,380 --> 04:46:34,460
Where am I?

7208
04:46:34,980 --> 04:46:36,400
How do I get out of here?

7209
04:46:41,660 --> 04:46:43,160
Okay, I'm not trying to find loot.

7210
04:46:43,220 --> 04:46:44,780
I'm actually trying to figure out how to leave.

7211
04:46:47,000 --> 04:46:47,760
Oh, hey!

7212
04:46:47,860 --> 04:46:48,520
On the statue?

7213
04:46:49,760 --> 04:46:50,700
There's a statue?

7214
04:46:53,820 --> 04:46:54,700
Behind me!

7215
04:47:01,610 --> 04:47:02,830
It was like...

7216
04:47:04,010 --> 04:47:05,570
Back in the OG room.

7217
04:47:09,660 --> 04:47:10,220
Right?

7218
04:47:11,380 --> 04:47:11,940
Guys...

7219
04:47:11,940 --> 04:47:13,060
Doki map.

7220
04:47:13,460 --> 04:47:14,520
There it is.

7221
04:47:14,680 --> 04:47:15,280
There it is!

7222
04:47:16,400 --> 04:47:16,960
Nice.

7223
04:47:24,660 --> 04:47:26,000
We made it.

7224
04:47:26,880 --> 04:47:28,360
We made it, guys.

7225
04:47:28,740 --> 04:47:29,060
Okay.

7226
04:47:29,100 --> 04:47:30,680
Can I craft shotgun ammo?

7227
04:47:30,760 --> 04:47:31,320
Oh, thank God.

7228
04:47:31,360 --> 04:47:31,780
I have zero.

7229
04:47:33,180 --> 04:47:33,740
Oh...

7230
04:47:33,740 --> 04:47:35,960
It's always poverty hours here.

7231
04:47:39,760 --> 04:47:41,920
It's just always poverty hours.

7232
04:47:42,880 --> 04:47:43,640
How do I get here?

7233
04:47:43,640 --> 04:47:43,700
What do I need here?

7234
04:47:44,680 --> 04:47:46,080
Oh, I need Ashley.

7235
04:47:50,490 --> 04:47:53,750
Oh, this was like... that's so funny.

7236
04:47:53,970 --> 04:47:56,310
I accidentally scammed all of you.

7237
04:48:07,810 --> 04:48:10,470
I thought you could use this door.

7238
04:48:14,620 --> 04:48:15,740
The shortcut.

7239
04:48:16,540 --> 04:48:19,200
There was only one way in.

7240
04:48:23,790 --> 04:48:24,950
Alright, here we go.

7241
04:48:25,930 --> 04:48:28,450
Cause how was I supposed to know there was one way?

7242
04:48:28,510 --> 04:48:30,010
I haven't played the remake!

7243
04:48:30,870 --> 04:48:33,770
The remake is so different from the OG!

7244
04:48:37,790 --> 04:48:40,750
Bro, it's been like almost three years.

7245
04:48:40,890 --> 04:48:42,870
How the fuck was I supposed to remember?

7246
04:48:52,570 --> 04:48:55,030
You can stop right there.

7247
04:48:56,070 --> 04:48:56,630
Ada!

7248
04:48:58,650 --> 04:48:59,210
Bacon.

7249
04:48:59,310 --> 04:49:01,170
Murder, looting, and extortion.

7250
04:49:01,270 --> 04:49:02,410
The classic Doki run.

7251
04:49:02,570 --> 04:49:03,410
Thank you for the superchat.

7252
04:49:03,490 --> 04:49:03,730
Thank you.

7253
04:49:03,970 --> 04:49:07,830
Well, after six years, that is one hell of a greeting.

7254
04:49:07,830 --> 04:49:09,350
Six years?!

7255
04:49:09,350 --> 04:49:09,650
Ada.

7256
04:49:10,570 --> 04:49:12,090
You don't seem surprised.

7257
04:49:12,990 --> 04:49:15,190
Has it really been six years, man?

7258
04:49:15,930 --> 04:49:16,490
Whoa!

7259
04:49:21,740 --> 04:49:23,440
Try using knives next time.

7260
04:49:24,100 --> 04:49:25,360
Better for close encounters.

7261
04:49:26,700 --> 04:49:29,220
My knife is a hundred thousand dollars.

7262
04:49:30,820 --> 04:49:31,860
More than that, Shudie.

7263
04:49:31,860 --> 04:49:33,280
So what are you working for this time?

7264
04:49:33,640 --> 04:49:34,500
Oh, Leon.

7265
04:49:44,620 --> 04:49:45,440
Leave the girl.

7266
04:49:46,380 --> 04:49:47,700
She's lost no matter what.

7267
04:49:49,080 --> 04:49:50,060
You know that!

7268
04:49:50,160 --> 04:49:51,540
It's just a phase, Ada!

7269
04:49:53,160 --> 04:49:54,960
Maybe you'll live to meet me again.

7270
04:49:55,640 --> 04:49:57,380
And then I might get you that greeting you were always asking for.

7271
04:49:57,380 --> 04:50:02,000
See, last time I superchatted, I was asking you to throw the boxes out in the Superfront gate.

7272
04:50:02,000 --> 04:50:04,260
And you only threw one box.

7273
04:50:04,440 --> 04:50:06,840
Pulled me twice to save on me.

7274
04:50:08,380 --> 04:50:11,140
How about we continue this discussion another time?

7275
04:50:18,040 --> 04:50:19,500
Oh my gosh, she disappeared.

7276
04:50:19,880 --> 04:50:20,920
She's so fast.

7277
04:50:23,520 --> 04:50:24,440
That's magic.

7278
04:50:26,760 --> 04:50:27,560
She got that bug.

7279
04:50:27,560 --> 04:50:28,860
Last person I thought I'd run to here.

7280
04:50:32,080 --> 04:50:32,680
Grandma.

7281
04:50:34,580 --> 04:50:36,420
Did she just jump out the window?

7282
04:50:38,380 --> 04:50:39,780
She's bad, man.

7283
04:50:42,800 --> 04:50:43,840
Okay, we have fun.

7284
04:50:44,700 --> 04:50:45,920
Okay, there's no up.

7285
04:50:47,640 --> 04:50:50,080
Where the fuck is the jewelry?

7286
04:50:50,960 --> 04:50:52,260
Okay, we have no key.

7287
04:50:53,520 --> 04:50:57,180
Is there any bells to...

7288
04:50:57,180 --> 04:50:58,420
Oh, there's a chest right here.

7289
04:50:59,500 --> 04:51:00,020
Okay.

7290
04:51:00,020 --> 04:51:00,540
Nice.

7291
04:51:01,160 --> 04:51:02,080
Got the clock.

7292
04:51:03,740 --> 04:51:04,260
Nice.

7293
04:51:04,360 --> 04:51:07,040
Alright, we don't have the key for this yet.

7294
04:51:07,500 --> 04:51:09,600
So, we gotta go forward.

7295
04:51:11,840 --> 04:51:12,540
Wait, what?

7296
04:51:12,780 --> 04:51:13,620
What did I miss?

7297
04:51:13,860 --> 04:51:14,240
Door?

7298
04:51:14,440 --> 04:51:15,400
What is this bug?

7299
04:51:15,480 --> 04:51:16,460
This random bug.

7300
04:51:18,560 --> 04:51:19,280
Let's throw...

7301
04:51:19,280 --> 04:51:20,060
Let's throw a graph.

7302
04:51:20,260 --> 04:51:20,760
Let's see.

7303
04:51:22,520 --> 04:51:23,860
Oh, it's this, right?

7304
04:51:25,620 --> 04:51:26,860
Oh, we need two more.

7305
04:51:27,240 --> 04:51:28,540
Okay, I figured it out.

7306
04:51:28,720 --> 04:51:29,860
Oh, we need three...

7307
04:51:29,860 --> 04:51:30,520
One more.

7308
04:51:30,780 --> 04:51:31,900
I figured it out.

7309
04:51:32,420 --> 04:51:33,360
I'm so smart.

7310
04:51:34,320 --> 04:51:35,660
We just need one more.

7311
04:51:36,160 --> 04:51:36,900
It's right here.

7312
04:51:40,400 --> 04:51:41,400
I'm so smart.

7313
04:51:42,820 --> 04:51:44,840
Oh my god, how did she do it?

7314
04:51:45,820 --> 04:51:48,220
It's like everything was just in the room.

7315
04:51:49,480 --> 04:51:50,000
Okay.

7316
04:51:52,420 --> 04:51:52,940
What?

7317
04:51:53,960 --> 04:51:54,880
What do the...

7318
04:51:54,880 --> 04:51:55,640
What do they mean?

7319
04:51:59,490 --> 04:52:00,950
Oh, I can rotate?

7320
04:52:02,310 --> 04:52:02,830
Oh!

7321
04:52:05,270 --> 04:52:05,790
Oh!

7322
04:52:06,970 --> 04:52:07,490
Okay.

7323
04:52:08,750 --> 04:52:09,030
Okay.

7324
04:52:09,370 --> 04:52:10,230
That's what they...

7325
04:52:10,230 --> 04:52:10,770
What kind of...

7326
04:52:10,770 --> 04:52:11,930
Who designed this puzzle?

7327
04:52:14,350 --> 04:52:15,810
Wait, but what the fuck are these?

7328
04:52:18,010 --> 04:52:20,510
I assume it's like this and...

7329
04:52:20,510 --> 04:52:21,550
No, it has to be blue.

7330
04:52:22,690 --> 04:52:24,170
So, I assume that...

7331
04:52:24,690 --> 04:52:25,370
Just like that.

7332
04:52:25,930 --> 04:52:26,370
Right?

7333
04:52:28,650 --> 04:52:29,090
Not...

7334
04:52:29,090 --> 04:52:29,470
What?

7335
04:52:31,950 --> 04:52:32,390
What?

7336
04:52:35,980 --> 04:52:37,020
It has to be blue.

7337
04:52:37,940 --> 04:52:38,920
Wait, I get it!

7338
04:52:38,980 --> 04:52:39,860
I get it!

7339
04:52:39,860 --> 04:52:40,500
I get it!

7340
04:52:40,720 --> 04:52:41,200
Wait.

7341
04:52:42,220 --> 04:52:43,520
Okay, what's behind this?

7342
04:52:44,020 --> 04:52:44,860
It's a shield.

7343
04:52:45,840 --> 04:52:46,320
Wait.

7344
04:52:54,670 --> 04:52:55,150
Wait.

7345
04:52:58,690 --> 04:52:59,670
Wait, I get it.

7346
04:52:59,730 --> 04:53:00,210
I get it!

7347
04:53:00,310 --> 04:53:00,750
I get it!

7348
04:53:05,660 --> 04:53:06,140
Wait.

7349
04:53:07,520 --> 04:53:08,440
Is that...

7350
04:53:11,380 --> 04:53:13,240
God, I'm so smart!

7351
04:53:15,420 --> 04:53:16,500
I figured it out.

7352
04:53:18,860 --> 04:53:19,820
Let me cook!

7353
04:53:19,820 --> 04:53:21,820
It's a puzzle for children!

7354
04:53:22,220 --> 04:53:24,880
I told you I figured it out!

7355
04:53:28,880 --> 04:53:30,120
Alright, we gotta go.

7356
04:53:31,060 --> 04:53:32,000
Gotta go forward.

7357
04:53:34,540 --> 04:53:37,200
Here, the signal echoes through the mountains.

7358
04:53:37,560 --> 04:53:40,820
Rock becomes gravel and the castle wall crumbles.

7359
04:53:41,220 --> 04:53:44,220
Behold, the crimson shade of the night sky.

7360
04:53:44,520 --> 04:53:48,780
A river of tainted blood befalls the sea.

7361
04:53:49,320 --> 04:53:52,060
Sacrifice your life and the blood of your enemies.

7362
04:53:58,400 --> 04:53:59,820
What's that sound?

7363
04:54:00,480 --> 04:54:01,800
I don't like that sound.

7364
04:54:02,280 --> 04:54:03,520
I take it back.

7365
04:54:04,560 --> 04:54:05,740
Oh money though!

7366
04:54:10,090 --> 04:54:11,790
What the fuck was that?

7367
04:54:12,350 --> 04:54:13,250
What was that?

7368
04:54:13,270 --> 04:54:13,810
I have a shotgun.

7369
04:54:14,710 --> 04:54:15,270
Woah!

7370
04:54:17,810 --> 04:54:19,130
What was that?

7371
04:54:21,350 --> 04:54:23,050
There's a small key behind me?

7372
04:54:23,110 --> 04:54:23,550
You liar!

7373
04:54:24,110 --> 04:54:25,410
You fucking liar!

7374
04:54:26,050 --> 04:54:27,730
There is no key behind me.

7375
04:54:32,370 --> 04:54:33,430
There is no key.

7376
04:54:37,400 --> 04:54:38,520
Oh my god.

7377
04:54:38,600 --> 04:54:39,800
What the fuck was that?

7378
04:54:43,040 --> 04:54:43,900
What is that?

7379
04:54:45,680 --> 04:54:46,520
What was that?

7380
04:54:49,960 --> 04:54:51,380
Wait, what the fuck was that?

7381
04:54:54,400 --> 04:54:55,860
What the fuck was that?

7382
04:54:58,100 --> 04:54:59,240
Oh there's the key.

7383
04:54:59,320 --> 04:54:59,940
Wait I can go back.

7384
04:55:00,720 --> 04:55:01,920
I'm gonna go back.

7385
04:55:02,200 --> 04:55:03,640
Bro I'm gonna go back.

7386
04:55:03,700 --> 04:55:04,660
I'm gonna unlock that drawer.

7387
04:55:08,900 --> 04:55:11,200
I'm gonna unlock that drawer.

7388
04:55:12,640 --> 04:55:15,780
There is no need for me to be back there yet.

7389
04:55:20,050 --> 04:55:21,930
Gonna unlock this drawer.

7390
04:55:22,530 --> 04:55:24,170
It makes me feel safe.

7391
04:55:25,930 --> 04:55:26,510
Nice.

7392
04:55:27,350 --> 04:55:28,790
Oh pocket watch.

7393
04:55:29,090 --> 04:55:29,670
Money.

7394
04:55:32,670 --> 04:55:33,130
Alright.

7395
04:55:33,190 --> 04:55:33,610
Here I go.

7396
04:55:34,930 --> 04:55:36,010
Here I go.

7397
04:55:36,830 --> 04:55:37,790
Free loot.

7398
04:55:49,000 --> 04:55:52,540
Don't wanna deal with whatever is over there.

7399
04:55:55,720 --> 04:55:56,360
Ahhhhhh.

7400
04:56:00,700 --> 04:56:01,020
Guys.

7401
04:56:01,180 --> 04:56:02,160
What chapter is Ashley?

7402
04:56:02,320 --> 04:56:02,900
Missions?

7403
04:56:02,900 --> 04:56:04,640
This is very important.

7404
04:56:09,360 --> 04:56:12,120
Oh god, why is the hallway so long?

7405
04:56:17,110 --> 04:56:19,350
What the fuck is that?!

7406
04:56:19,350 --> 04:56:22,750
Holy shit, that scared the shit out of me!

7407
04:56:24,310 --> 04:56:25,630
Oh my god!

7408
04:56:30,290 --> 04:56:32,750
That actually scared the shit out of me.

7409
04:56:32,790 --> 04:56:33,570
Holy fuck.

7410
04:56:33,770 --> 04:56:34,710
Is that Spada?

7411
04:56:34,790 --> 04:56:35,610
What are you?

7412
04:56:36,950 --> 04:56:38,070
Jesus Christ!

7413
04:56:43,460 --> 04:56:44,720
What the fuck are you?

7414
04:56:47,660 --> 04:56:49,720
Oh my god, you're getting too old for this job, man.

7415
04:56:50,340 --> 04:56:52,040
You're getting way too old for this job.

7416
04:56:52,960 --> 04:56:54,300
Oh thank god, there you are.

7417
04:56:57,400 --> 04:56:59,140
I know, what the fuck was that?

7418
04:57:00,120 --> 04:57:00,920
Okay, selling...

7419
04:57:01,460 --> 04:57:03,160
Uh, ornate mirror...

7420
04:57:03,160 --> 04:57:04,680
Okay, there's no...

7421
04:57:04,680 --> 04:57:06,440
Oh, I have jewels here.

7422
04:57:06,580 --> 04:57:06,800
Okay.

7423
04:57:06,900 --> 04:57:07,960
I have jewels for this.

7424
04:57:08,080 --> 04:57:08,480
Okay, wait.

7425
04:57:08,580 --> 04:57:09,280
We gotta do this.

7426
04:57:09,620 --> 04:57:10,480
It's money time.

7427
04:57:11,700 --> 04:57:12,720
It's money time!

7428
04:57:13,460 --> 04:57:15,400
Okay, double... we need...

7429
04:57:15,400 --> 04:57:17,320
One of this...

7430
04:57:17,920 --> 04:57:19,540
And then one of this.

7431
04:57:19,900 --> 04:57:21,380
Wait, can I do...

7432
04:57:21,900 --> 04:57:22,900
Triple... double red?

7433
04:57:23,500 --> 04:57:24,300
Is that it?

7434
04:57:24,400 --> 04:57:24,940
1.2?

7435
04:57:26,060 --> 04:57:27,060
Yeah, double red.

7436
04:57:27,120 --> 04:57:27,380
Nice!

7437
04:57:27,800 --> 04:57:29,020
We got the double red.

7438
04:57:29,980 --> 04:57:31,020
And then...

7439
04:57:31,840 --> 04:57:32,360
That's it.

7440
04:57:33,080 --> 04:57:34,240
That's all I can do.

7441
04:57:35,100 --> 04:57:37,080
Okay, sell, sell...

7442
04:57:38,600 --> 04:57:39,640
Sell, sell...

7443
04:57:40,900 --> 04:57:41,420
Uh...

7444
04:57:41,960 --> 04:57:42,480
Sell...

7445
04:57:43,460 --> 04:57:44,660
And then... nothing else.

7446
04:57:44,900 --> 04:57:46,220
I don't have anything else.

7447
04:57:46,240 --> 04:57:46,660
I'm poor.

7448
04:57:47,220 --> 04:57:47,740
Yay!

7449
04:57:50,460 --> 04:57:52,300
Is there anything I can tune up?

7450
04:57:52,940 --> 04:57:56,560
Wait, is my body... Oh my gosh, my body is so fucked right now.

7451
04:57:59,720 --> 04:58:00,760
Okay, uh...

7452
04:58:01,640 --> 04:58:03,920
I don't think there's anything I really need to upgrade.

7453
04:58:05,720 --> 04:58:06,660
We're gonna hoard.

7454
04:58:06,880 --> 04:58:09,140
We're gonna keep hoarding our money.

7455
04:58:10,680 --> 04:58:13,000
We're gonna keep hoarding our money.

7456
04:58:13,000 --> 04:58:16,380
But I will do the rate of fire.

7457
04:58:16,600 --> 04:58:19,180
I can... I can like...

7458
04:58:19,180 --> 04:58:20,880
Spare a little bit.

7459
04:58:21,240 --> 04:58:22,840
Maxi upgrade of the pistol?

7460
04:58:23,080 --> 04:58:25,640
I don't need... Okay, I'll do the rate of fire.

7461
04:58:25,960 --> 04:58:28,420
We gotta save money to make money!

7462
04:58:30,160 --> 04:58:30,900
We gotta save money to make money!

7463
04:58:30,900 --> 04:58:31,420
Guys...

7464
04:58:31,420 --> 04:58:34,300
We gotta save money to make money!

7465
04:58:34,940 --> 04:58:36,600
We gotta save money to make money!

7466
04:58:36,600 --> 04:58:38,360
It's basic economics!

7467
04:58:42,240 --> 04:58:42,980
It's basic economics!

7468
04:58:43,000 --> 04:58:44,780
Save it for next game.

7469
04:58:46,600 --> 04:58:47,320
Wait, what?

7470
04:58:47,860 --> 04:58:48,720
Who said that?

7471
04:59:00,060 --> 04:59:01,020
Oh, fuck.

7472
04:59:01,280 --> 04:59:02,100
Bro, what?

7473
04:59:02,140 --> 04:59:02,840
He just stops talking?

7474
04:59:03,280 --> 04:59:05,580
Bro, why did you guys told me to shoot the bell?

7475
04:59:06,600 --> 04:59:08,740
Now I don't know what he wants me to do!

7476
04:59:09,040 --> 04:59:13,080
Now I don't know what he wants me to do!

7477
04:59:13,180 --> 04:59:16,540
You said there'd be something special that'll happen!

7478
04:59:19,260 --> 04:59:20,380
The lore...

7479
04:59:20,380 --> 04:59:20,980
The lore...

7480
04:59:20,980 --> 04:59:20,980
Now!

7481
04:59:21,200 --> 04:59:23,340
Now I don't have the lore!

7482
04:59:27,380 --> 04:59:30,200
Oh, there's a special upgrade if I max it out?

7483
04:59:30,520 --> 04:59:31,280
Okay, I'll do it.

7484
04:59:31,600 --> 04:59:32,480
What is it?

7485
04:59:34,580 --> 04:59:36,240
Guys, you fucking lied to me.

7486
04:59:36,520 --> 04:59:37,940
I got one guide again.

7487
04:59:38,400 --> 04:59:40,740
I got one guide.

7488
04:59:41,660 --> 04:59:43,260
I got one guide.

7489
04:59:43,880 --> 04:59:45,240
I can't believe it.

7490
04:59:46,220 --> 04:59:46,780
No...

7491
04:59:51,900 --> 04:59:52,620
No!

7492
04:59:53,020 --> 04:59:53,740
No!

7493
04:59:53,760 --> 04:59:54,740
Oh, it is.

7494
04:59:54,860 --> 04:59:55,500
You get it later.

7495
04:59:55,680 --> 04:59:56,140
No!

7496
04:59:56,180 --> 04:59:56,540
No!

7497
04:59:56,600 --> 04:59:57,760
What's the lore?

7498
05:00:02,340 --> 05:00:03,820
What's the lore?

7499
05:00:05,380 --> 05:00:06,820
What's the lore?

7500
05:00:07,720 --> 05:00:09,580
I can't believe it.

7501
05:00:10,040 --> 05:00:12,660
I'll never know what the lore is.

7502
05:00:14,480 --> 05:00:16,100
I'll never know.

7503
05:00:16,600 --> 05:00:17,320
I'll never know.

7504
05:00:18,320 --> 05:00:18,900
No.

7505
05:00:19,060 --> 05:00:22,080
I have to live with the actions of my consequence.

7506
05:00:23,520 --> 05:00:25,560
I have to live with it, guys.

7507
05:00:26,780 --> 05:00:27,360
Guys...

7508
05:00:27,360 --> 05:00:30,120
Guys, we're not boulders gating this, guys.

7509
05:00:30,360 --> 05:00:34,620
We have to live with our consequences, guys.

7510
05:00:34,940 --> 05:00:35,520
We have to live with our consequences, guys.

7511
05:00:35,520 --> 05:00:38,940
We can't just fucking skip the lore whenever we want.

7512
05:00:39,360 --> 05:00:39,660
We can't just fucking skip the lore whenever we want.

7513
05:00:40,200 --> 05:00:42,060
I know that's what you guys want.

7514
05:00:42,320 --> 05:00:42,640
Ow.

7515
05:00:42,960 --> 05:00:43,720
Fuck, okay.

7516
05:00:43,720 --> 05:00:43,900
Okay.

7517
05:00:43,920 --> 05:00:45,000
Bro, fuck this.

7518
05:00:45,060 --> 05:00:46,060
I'm too tired of this.

7519
05:00:49,000 --> 05:00:56,800
I know it's that easy, but we can't just skip the lore whenever we want, guys!

7520
05:00:57,700 --> 05:00:59,100
Oh my god!

7521
05:00:59,760 --> 05:01:01,680
Bro, merchant, help me!

7522
05:01:05,680 --> 05:01:08,960
Wait, can they like not... Wait, I can just be here.

7523
05:01:09,420 --> 05:01:10,380
Wait a minute.

7524
05:01:10,700 --> 05:01:11,900
Wait a minute.

7525
05:01:14,400 --> 05:01:15,300
Wait, that's great.

7526
05:01:15,440 --> 05:01:17,900
I can literally... Wait, I can cheese it like this.

7527
05:01:19,860 --> 05:01:20,360
That's great.

7528
05:01:24,050 --> 05:01:25,470
Wait, I can't shoot it from here.

7529
05:01:27,530 --> 05:01:28,110
Cheesing again.

7530
05:01:28,490 --> 05:01:29,750
The Doki special!

7531
05:01:34,610 --> 05:01:36,150
Oh my god, he's so fast.

7532
05:01:39,970 --> 05:01:41,050
Oh my god, thank god!

7533
05:01:41,090 --> 05:01:42,450
It made him throw away his shield.

7534
05:01:43,830 --> 05:01:44,930
That's so good for me.

7535
05:01:47,650 --> 05:01:48,290
There we go.

7536
05:01:48,310 --> 05:01:51,370
Oh, wait, is he... Okay, he doesn't mutate.

7537
05:01:51,450 --> 05:01:52,010
Okay, thank god.

7538
05:01:53,010 --> 05:01:53,750
Alright, nice.

7539
05:01:55,530 --> 05:01:56,190
We're fine.

7540
05:01:56,930 --> 05:01:57,610
We're fine.

7541
05:01:57,890 --> 05:02:00,030
Wait, you're still... There's still one more?

7542
05:02:02,550 --> 05:02:03,030
Nice.

7543
05:02:03,030 --> 05:02:03,650
Okay, he's dead.

7544
05:02:04,950 --> 05:02:05,870
I'm pretty sure.

7545
05:02:07,650 --> 05:02:08,370
Thank god.

7546
05:02:08,630 --> 05:02:09,750
The Doki special!

7547
05:02:11,130 --> 05:02:13,350
If you can cheese it, there's a way.

7548
05:02:17,720 --> 05:02:19,140
Oh, it's a puzzle!

7549
05:02:19,820 --> 05:02:20,420
Okay, I'm gonna go back.

7550
05:02:20,440 --> 05:02:22,220
I'm gonna make sure there's like nothing up here first.

7551
05:02:22,500 --> 05:02:23,660
Okay, I think I see how this works.

7552
05:02:24,260 --> 05:02:26,700
Alright, I'm gonna make... Wait, the fuck?

7553
05:02:28,120 --> 05:02:29,240
What is he doing here?

7554
05:02:29,960 --> 05:02:30,760
Get out of here.

7555
05:02:31,940 --> 05:02:33,020
Get out of here.

7556
05:02:33,240 --> 05:02:34,360
What are you doing here?

7557
05:02:34,460 --> 05:02:34,740
Oh!

7558
05:02:35,160 --> 05:02:35,600
Wow!

7559
05:02:37,640 --> 05:02:38,960
Alright, give me a sec.

7560
05:02:39,340 --> 05:02:39,780
Please!

7561
05:02:39,940 --> 05:02:40,820
Get on him!

7562
05:02:41,120 --> 05:02:41,560
Yes!

7563
05:02:41,640 --> 05:02:41,880
Good!

7564
05:02:44,400 --> 05:02:44,840
Good!

7565
05:02:44,840 --> 05:02:45,700
That's very helpful!

7566
05:02:47,120 --> 05:02:47,560
Oh!

7567
05:02:50,720 --> 05:02:52,760
That is very helpful, man!

7568
05:02:53,980 --> 05:02:54,440
Sab!

7569
05:02:54,580 --> 05:02:54,940
Sab!

7570
05:02:55,120 --> 05:02:55,400
Sab!

7571
05:02:55,660 --> 05:02:56,300
There you go.

7572
05:02:58,460 --> 05:03:02,240
Wait, now that I know I can just stab him, that is good.

7573
05:03:03,220 --> 05:03:04,020
That is good.

7574
05:03:04,880 --> 05:03:05,880
Now that I know.

7575
05:03:06,320 --> 05:03:08,240
I don't waste bullets from just...

7576
05:03:08,240 --> 05:03:10,060
I don't waste bullets from the spotters.

7577
05:03:10,500 --> 05:03:11,720
I can just shank them.

7578
05:03:13,220 --> 05:03:14,620
Let's back to London we go.

7579
05:03:15,540 --> 05:03:16,620
Okay, we do this.

7580
05:03:17,080 --> 05:03:17,540
Okay, we do this.

7581
05:03:17,560 --> 05:03:18,940
And then...

7582
05:03:19,560 --> 05:03:20,960
We go down.

7583
05:03:21,180 --> 05:03:23,960
And then we open that door.

7584
05:03:26,340 --> 05:03:27,820
And then we go...

7585
05:03:27,820 --> 05:03:28,100
Boop!

7586
05:03:28,440 --> 05:03:30,440
And then...

7587
05:03:30,440 --> 05:03:32,160
And then...

7588
05:03:32,160 --> 05:03:35,400
We go... Doki's special.

7589
05:03:35,820 --> 05:03:37,220
And then...

7590
05:03:37,220 --> 05:03:38,820
We go here.

7591
05:03:39,500 --> 05:03:41,760
And then we go downstairs.

7592
05:03:43,080 --> 05:03:44,840
And then the doors open.

7593
05:03:45,320 --> 05:03:45,940
Ta-da!

7594
05:03:46,180 --> 05:03:47,020
Magic!

7595
05:03:47,720 --> 05:03:49,180
James, thank you for the super chat!

7596
05:03:49,220 --> 05:03:49,860
Thank you, thank you!

7597
05:03:50,060 --> 05:03:52,000
Now I want to replay the game.

7598
05:03:52,080 --> 05:03:54,280
Damn it, why do you do this to me?

7599
05:03:56,480 --> 05:03:57,580
Alright, let's see.

7600
05:03:57,760 --> 05:03:59,300
I don't have enough for shotgun.

7601
05:03:59,400 --> 05:04:00,340
I'm gonna save up for shotgun.

7602
05:04:01,120 --> 05:04:03,680
Like, I feel like the shotgun is more important at this rate.

7603
05:04:04,560 --> 05:04:05,860
The rate I'm fucking going.

7604
05:04:07,840 --> 05:04:08,380
Drop down!

7605
05:04:12,020 --> 05:04:12,920
Wait, which way?

7606
05:04:13,680 --> 05:04:14,340
Oh no.

7607
05:04:15,040 --> 05:04:16,620
Is this the treasure room?

7608
05:04:17,740 --> 05:04:19,620
This is not the safe room.

7609
05:04:20,160 --> 05:04:20,680
Shake!

7610
05:04:20,780 --> 05:04:21,180
Shake!

7611
05:04:21,300 --> 05:04:21,760
Shake!

7612
05:04:21,880 --> 05:04:22,380
Shake!

7613
05:04:22,680 --> 05:04:23,200
Shake!

7614
05:04:23,240 --> 05:04:23,760
Shake!

7615
05:04:23,800 --> 05:04:24,100
Shake!

7616
05:04:24,100 --> 05:04:24,360
Shake!

7617
05:04:24,500 --> 05:04:24,900
Wooo!

7618
05:04:25,440 --> 05:04:25,960
Shit!

7619
05:04:26,180 --> 05:04:26,500
Okay.

7620
05:04:26,920 --> 05:04:29,500
Okay, I did not think he'd be that close.

7621
05:04:30,500 --> 05:04:32,240
That was an accident.

7622
05:04:36,900 --> 05:04:37,420
Alright.

7623
05:04:42,090 --> 05:04:43,850
Okay, I'm just gonna shoot with you here.

7624
05:04:48,140 --> 05:04:48,940
Okay, nice.

7625
05:04:49,180 --> 05:04:50,360
You don't know where I am.

7626
05:04:50,940 --> 05:04:51,720
There we go.

7627
05:04:52,540 --> 05:04:53,060
Good.

7628
05:04:53,680 --> 05:04:53,840
Ah!

7629
05:04:54,180 --> 05:04:54,680
Ah!

7630
05:04:54,960 --> 05:04:55,460
Fuck!

7631
05:04:59,490 --> 05:05:00,210
There we go.

7632
05:05:00,650 --> 05:05:02,690
Okay, I did not fucking see there.

7633
05:05:04,570 --> 05:05:05,570
Jesus Christ.

7634
05:05:05,950 --> 05:05:07,790
I did not see her at all.

7635
05:05:09,650 --> 05:05:11,450
Oh, that scared the shit out of me.

7636
05:05:11,930 --> 05:05:12,430
Fuck.

7637
05:05:12,470 --> 05:05:12,730
Okay.

7638
05:05:12,790 --> 05:05:13,930
At least we got shotgun ammo.

7639
05:05:14,130 --> 05:05:16,050
That is good.

7640
05:05:16,650 --> 05:05:18,110
We got shotgun ammo.

7641
05:05:18,670 --> 05:05:20,070
Oh, it's another puzzle?

7642
05:05:20,370 --> 05:05:21,010
Come on!

7643
05:05:22,490 --> 05:05:25,690
Wait, if that's a puzzle, then what's over there?

7644
05:05:25,850 --> 05:05:26,710
Wait, there's a...

7645
05:05:26,710 --> 05:05:27,470
treasure!

7646
05:05:29,450 --> 05:05:30,750
I'm looking up.

7647
05:05:31,870 --> 05:05:33,190
I'm looking up.

7648
05:05:34,290 --> 05:05:35,510
There's a treasure.

7649
05:05:36,890 --> 05:05:37,250
Treasure?

7650
05:05:39,170 --> 05:05:40,250
It's upstairs.

7651
05:05:41,550 --> 05:05:43,110
Where the fuck's the treasure?

7652
05:05:45,670 --> 05:05:47,130
It's above me.

7653
05:05:47,290 --> 05:05:48,730
How do I get above?

7654
05:05:49,730 --> 05:05:50,450
Huh?

7655
05:05:51,270 --> 05:05:52,510
It's like here.

7656
05:05:55,270 --> 05:05:56,450
That's not the lantern.

7657
05:05:58,690 --> 05:05:59,670
There's a lantern?

7658
05:06:02,630 --> 05:06:03,790
It's not that one.

7659
05:06:03,830 --> 05:06:04,870
That's the fire lantern.

7660
05:06:05,070 --> 05:06:05,790
That's not it.

7661
05:06:05,950 --> 05:06:06,990
Is that the lantern?

7662
05:06:09,250 --> 05:06:11,330
That's the fire lantern, you idiots!

7663
05:06:11,630 --> 05:06:12,510
It's not this one.

7664
05:06:16,870 --> 05:06:18,810
That's the fucking fire lantern.

7665
05:06:19,290 --> 05:06:21,610
There's no jewelry here.

7666
05:06:21,810 --> 05:06:22,490
I don't know.

7667
05:06:23,110 --> 05:06:24,110
It's something...

7668
05:06:24,110 --> 05:06:25,130
It's above me.

7669
05:06:27,990 --> 05:06:30,230
I knew that was the fire lantern.

7670
05:06:31,110 --> 05:06:32,730
There was fire in it.

7671
05:06:32,870 --> 05:06:33,970
Like, what else could it be?

7672
05:06:34,210 --> 05:06:35,490
It was literally fire.

7673
05:06:36,650 --> 05:06:38,190
I'm just gonna kill this guy though.

7674
05:06:40,390 --> 05:06:41,390
Oh my god.

7675
05:06:41,870 --> 05:06:42,390
Nice.

7676
05:06:43,290 --> 05:06:44,170
Come on.

7677
05:06:44,290 --> 05:06:45,550
Can't take another headshot.

7678
05:06:45,770 --> 05:06:46,510
There we go.

7679
05:06:50,220 --> 05:06:50,740
Okay.

7680
05:06:51,700 --> 05:06:53,180
Oh, there he is.

7681
05:06:53,260 --> 05:06:54,520
You think you can scare me?

7682
05:06:54,980 --> 05:06:56,360
That's fucking right.

7683
05:06:56,660 --> 05:06:58,420
You thought you could scare me?

7684
05:06:58,460 --> 05:06:59,280
That's fucking right.

7685
05:06:59,360 --> 05:06:59,820
I see you.

7686
05:06:59,960 --> 05:07:01,440
I see you right there.

7687
05:07:03,720 --> 05:07:05,440
I see you right there.

7688
05:07:06,200 --> 05:07:07,840
You ain't fooling me.

7689
05:07:08,060 --> 05:07:08,460
You ain't fooling me.

7690
05:07:08,500 --> 05:07:09,100
Alright.

7691
05:07:09,840 --> 05:07:12,440
Let us go back for the puzzle.

7692
05:07:12,500 --> 05:07:13,480
It's puzzle time!

7693
05:07:13,660 --> 05:07:14,640
It's our favorite!

7694
05:07:17,200 --> 05:07:18,220
Puzzle time!

7695
05:07:19,420 --> 05:07:20,720
I love puzzles.

7696
05:07:20,740 --> 05:07:21,020
I love puzzles.

7697
05:07:22,580 --> 05:07:23,800
Alright, where is this?

7698
05:07:24,040 --> 05:07:24,220
Okay.

7699
05:07:25,120 --> 05:07:26,020
Press this.

7700
05:07:27,540 --> 05:07:29,760
My brain expands a little bit.

7701
05:07:31,120 --> 05:07:32,240
And then...

7702
05:07:32,240 --> 05:07:32,800
Whoa.

7703
05:07:33,000 --> 05:07:35,580
Leon, you pulled out the guns out of nowhere.

7704
05:07:36,520 --> 05:07:37,080
Hmm.

7705
05:07:37,680 --> 05:07:39,700
I hear something above me.

7706
05:07:44,920 --> 05:07:46,340
I see you.

7707
05:07:46,680 --> 05:07:47,780
That's fucking right.

7708
05:07:47,820 --> 05:07:49,380
You think I didn't see you there?

7709
05:07:49,840 --> 05:07:50,660
That's right.

7710
05:07:50,760 --> 05:07:51,520
What the fuck?

7711
05:07:51,520 --> 05:07:52,860
Wait, I did not see you though.

7712
05:07:53,740 --> 05:07:54,400
I did not.

7713
05:07:55,020 --> 05:07:56,620
Where did you come from?

7714
05:07:59,960 --> 05:08:00,980
Okay, he didn't turn.

7715
05:08:01,120 --> 05:08:01,400
Okay.

7716
05:08:01,980 --> 05:08:02,580
Thank god.

7717
05:08:02,780 --> 05:08:03,520
I was like, wait.

7718
05:08:03,640 --> 05:08:05,100
I see you, but you?

7719
05:08:08,160 --> 05:08:08,940
Okay, money.

7720
05:08:09,600 --> 05:08:12,440
Guys, you need to drop something that's not money, guys.

7721
05:08:12,680 --> 05:08:13,100
Please.

7722
05:08:13,960 --> 05:08:15,500
That's all I ask of you.

7723
05:08:18,660 --> 05:08:21,460
Okay, and then we drop down from... wait.

7724
05:08:21,460 --> 05:08:23,600
We drop down from here.

7725
05:08:24,500 --> 05:08:25,760
We're like here.

7726
05:08:27,400 --> 05:08:28,260
Wait, no.

7727
05:08:28,300 --> 05:08:29,480
That has to be money.

7728
05:08:30,900 --> 05:08:31,500
Money?

7729
05:08:35,760 --> 05:08:36,360
Money?

7730
05:08:36,580 --> 05:08:36,700
Money?

7731
05:08:39,360 --> 05:08:39,960
No?

7732
05:08:41,200 --> 05:08:42,140
No money?

7733
05:08:46,090 --> 05:08:47,010
Where's money?

7734
05:08:50,950 --> 05:08:53,130
Oh, and then I do the...

7735
05:08:53,130 --> 05:08:55,070
And then I do the...

7736
05:08:55,070 --> 05:08:55,750
The lever?

7737
05:08:56,810 --> 05:09:00,810
I do the lever and then I go back and then there's money.

7738
05:09:03,250 --> 05:09:03,810
There.

7739
05:09:04,170 --> 05:09:06,230
And then I go back here.

7740
05:09:10,510 --> 05:09:11,630
And then...

7741
05:09:11,630 --> 05:09:12,370
Money?

7742
05:09:13,290 --> 05:09:13,850
Money!

7743
05:09:14,770 --> 05:09:15,970
Oh, fuck.

7744
05:09:16,050 --> 05:09:16,330
Okay.

7745
05:09:16,390 --> 05:09:17,030
And then...

7746
05:09:17,030 --> 05:09:18,170
And then I...

7747
05:09:18,170 --> 05:09:19,450
Oh my god, I'm so confused.

7748
05:09:19,450 --> 05:09:19,910
Guys!

7749
05:09:22,950 --> 05:09:24,690
I'm so confused.

7750
05:09:25,070 --> 05:09:26,790
Okay, and then...

7751
05:09:27,070 --> 05:09:28,470
And then I...

7752
05:09:29,550 --> 05:09:31,170
I go here.

7753
05:09:33,310 --> 05:09:34,470
I go here.

7754
05:09:36,470 --> 05:09:38,290
And then I go up.

7755
05:09:39,710 --> 05:09:43,050
And then I drop down.

7756
05:09:45,270 --> 05:09:46,890
And then I drop down.

7757
05:09:47,110 --> 05:09:48,470
And then money.

7758
05:09:54,280 --> 05:09:55,120
Money?

7759
05:09:58,400 --> 05:09:59,760
And then...

7760
05:10:01,120 --> 05:10:02,260
And then...

7761
05:10:02,260 --> 05:10:02,340
Money?

7762
05:10:03,800 --> 05:10:05,540
Wait, is there lantern here?

7763
05:10:06,900 --> 05:10:07,320
Lantern?

7764
05:10:10,120 --> 05:10:10,960
Lantern?

7765
05:10:10,960 --> 05:10:12,540
Is there lantern here?

7766
05:10:17,280 --> 05:10:20,400
Okay, and then I go up.

7767
05:10:25,440 --> 05:10:26,280
Okay, and then I go up.

7768
05:10:26,280 --> 05:10:26,880
And then...

7769
05:10:26,880 --> 05:10:28,360
Okay.

7770
05:10:28,840 --> 05:10:29,360
I do this.

7771
05:10:31,220 --> 05:10:31,820
Nice.

7772
05:10:31,860 --> 05:10:32,620
Okay, we're good.

7773
05:10:33,360 --> 05:10:34,260
We're okay.

7774
05:10:35,100 --> 05:10:36,640
And then I unlock this.

7775
05:10:37,800 --> 05:10:38,640
And then...

7776
05:10:38,640 --> 05:10:41,060
Everything is good to go.

7777
05:10:41,340 --> 05:10:42,080
Everything is good to go.

7778
05:10:42,140 --> 05:10:44,320
The doorway in front of the ladder?

7779
05:10:44,660 --> 05:10:46,380
What's that gotta do with money?

7780
05:10:48,360 --> 05:10:50,800
And then I can open this door!

7781
05:10:59,590 --> 05:11:00,790
And then...

7782
05:11:04,020 --> 05:11:05,020
And then...

7783
05:11:05,020 --> 05:11:05,160
And then...

7784
05:11:05,900 --> 05:11:06,460
Money.

7785
05:11:07,740 --> 05:11:08,800
There we go.

7786
05:11:08,840 --> 05:11:09,360
We did it.

7787
05:11:09,400 --> 05:11:10,640
We figured it out, guys.

7788
05:11:11,240 --> 05:11:12,400
How do we get there?

7789
05:11:13,160 --> 05:11:13,720
Wait.

7790
05:11:14,300 --> 05:11:15,020
Wait, no.

7791
05:11:15,180 --> 05:11:16,080
What did I do?

7792
05:11:18,100 --> 05:11:18,940
Wait, no.

7793
05:11:19,420 --> 05:11:21,320
Oh, I missed out that door!

7794
05:11:23,090 --> 05:11:24,010
So stupid.

7795
05:11:28,690 --> 05:11:31,770
I didn't think there was a door there, Kev.

7796
05:11:31,970 --> 05:11:34,650
I didn't see the door.

7797
05:11:35,370 --> 05:11:36,210
I didn't see the door.

7798
05:11:37,650 --> 05:11:38,410
No!

7799
05:11:39,050 --> 05:11:39,270
No!

7800
05:11:40,210 --> 05:11:40,970
Okay.

7801
05:11:41,850 --> 05:11:43,130
I'm just blind.

7802
05:11:43,550 --> 05:11:45,630
Okay, and then we go through here.

7803
05:11:46,210 --> 05:11:47,290
And then...

7804
05:11:48,010 --> 05:11:48,870
And then...

7805
05:11:48,870 --> 05:11:50,930
And then we go up.

7806
05:11:52,530 --> 05:11:53,810
Here we go.

7807
05:11:53,910 --> 05:11:55,710
We're fucking thinking right now.

7808
05:11:55,910 --> 05:11:57,730
And then we go here.

7809
05:11:58,110 --> 05:11:59,130
And then...

7810
05:11:59,130 --> 05:12:00,130
And then we...

7811
05:12:00,130 --> 05:12:04,030
We turn on the lever here.

7812
05:12:04,030 --> 05:12:06,130
So it's sunny now.

7813
05:12:06,750 --> 05:12:08,390
And then we...

7814
05:12:08,390 --> 05:12:09,850
We go here.

7815
05:12:11,790 --> 05:12:13,070
And then...

7816
05:12:16,500 --> 05:12:17,140
Wait.

7817
05:12:17,260 --> 05:12:17,900
I hear things.

7818
05:12:18,180 --> 05:12:20,560
And then we turn this lever.

7819
05:12:24,340 --> 05:12:26,520
And then we go through this door.

7820
05:12:26,900 --> 05:12:28,800
And then we go down.

7821
05:12:29,320 --> 05:12:30,880
And then money!

7822
05:12:33,660 --> 05:12:35,240
We did it!

7823
05:12:35,680 --> 05:12:37,720
Oh gosh, we're so smart.

7824
05:12:38,540 --> 05:12:39,220
We...

7825
05:12:39,220 --> 05:12:41,140
What will you guys do about me?

7826
05:12:41,600 --> 05:12:44,160
What will you guys do?

7827
05:12:44,280 --> 05:12:47,360
What will you guys do about me, chat?

7828
05:12:48,240 --> 05:12:49,700
God damn it!

7829
05:12:49,780 --> 05:12:50,400
Come on!

7830
05:12:52,140 --> 05:12:53,440
Come on, guys!

7831
05:12:56,620 --> 05:12:58,680
What will you guys do?

7832
05:12:59,260 --> 05:13:00,600
What will you guys do?

7833
05:13:00,740 --> 05:13:03,600
I feel like you guys cannot live!

7834
05:13:03,880 --> 05:13:04,080
I feel like you guys cannot live!

7835
05:13:07,630 --> 05:13:12,410
You guys won't be able to function without this genius brain!

7836
05:13:14,490 --> 05:13:16,630
Okay, we're gonna make sure we kill this guy though.

7837
05:13:22,030 --> 05:13:24,950
Like, you cannot comprehend my logic.

7838
05:13:27,710 --> 05:13:30,010
That's how fucking ingenious I am.

7839
05:13:30,470 --> 05:13:32,030
Okay, kick kick kick kick kick kick.

7840
05:13:32,110 --> 05:13:32,410
Yes!

7841
05:13:32,610 --> 05:13:33,570
Got it in time.

7842
05:13:33,750 --> 05:13:35,210
And then she- oh he's dead.

7843
05:13:35,290 --> 05:13:36,390
Okay, I thought I had to shank him.

7844
05:13:37,630 --> 05:13:38,450
Alright, nice.

7845
05:13:40,230 --> 05:13:43,470
I feel like this stage is taking much longer than it should.

7846
05:13:45,530 --> 05:13:49,670
Due to how ingenious I am.

7847
05:13:50,130 --> 05:13:52,370
Wait, where does this close and open though?

7848
05:13:52,930 --> 05:13:54,010
It's sun time.

7849
05:13:55,710 --> 05:13:56,310
Nothing?

7850
05:13:56,690 --> 05:13:57,430
Oh, okay.

7851
05:13:57,890 --> 05:13:59,270
It's morning now.

7852
05:14:00,410 --> 05:14:01,950
Is there anybody out here?

7853
05:14:02,490 --> 05:14:03,950
Oh wait, there's this.

7854
05:14:04,470 --> 05:14:05,450
What does that do?

7855
05:14:06,130 --> 05:14:07,210
I'll never know.

7856
05:14:08,630 --> 05:14:10,390
What the fuck did I just do?

7857
05:14:13,850 --> 05:14:15,190
What the fuck was that?

7858
05:14:18,130 --> 05:14:19,230
I'll never know.

7859
05:14:19,930 --> 05:14:21,090
I'll never know.

7860
05:14:22,050 --> 05:14:24,150
It'll always be my little secret.

7861
05:14:26,190 --> 05:14:27,430
I don't like this.

7862
05:14:28,850 --> 05:14:30,690
What the fuck is that?

7863
05:14:31,750 --> 05:14:32,710
Excuse me?

7864
05:14:33,630 --> 05:14:34,230
How?

7865
05:14:34,510 --> 05:14:35,810
How do I kill him?

7866
05:14:36,250 --> 05:14:36,650
Oh!

7867
05:14:37,270 --> 05:14:37,870
What?

7868
05:14:40,570 --> 05:14:41,050
Why?

7869
05:14:41,050 --> 05:14:41,890
Can I kill him?

7870
05:14:49,380 --> 05:14:50,420
Can I kill him?

7871
05:14:54,200 --> 05:14:55,160
Can I kill him?

7872
05:14:55,200 --> 05:14:55,680
No?!

7873
05:14:56,560 --> 05:14:59,760
Okay, guys, apparently I can't kill him.

7874
05:15:00,980 --> 05:15:02,080
Where do I go?

7875
05:15:02,740 --> 05:15:04,060
Oh God, this way, this way.

7876
05:15:04,180 --> 05:15:04,620
It's yellow.

7877
05:15:05,080 --> 05:15:05,940
It's yellow.

7878
05:15:06,040 --> 05:15:07,220
That means I go here.

7879
05:15:07,540 --> 05:15:08,780
What is he going to do?

7880
05:15:08,820 --> 05:15:09,880
Throw that rock at me?

7881
05:15:10,020 --> 05:15:10,860
That's fucking right.

7882
05:15:11,240 --> 05:15:12,800
You can do jack shit.

7883
05:15:12,800 --> 05:15:14,100
Follow the yellow!

7884
05:15:16,020 --> 05:15:17,640
Follow the... oh shit!

7885
05:15:20,840 --> 05:15:23,420
Okay, there's no way this hits me, right?

7886
05:15:23,560 --> 05:15:25,080
I need scientific reasons.

7887
05:15:25,340 --> 05:15:26,220
This hits me.

7888
05:15:26,320 --> 05:15:29,540
Guys, there is a way for this to hit me.

7889
05:15:31,500 --> 05:15:33,820
Guys, I found out.

7890
05:15:33,940 --> 05:15:35,640
There is a way.

7891
05:15:36,020 --> 05:15:37,580
There is a way!

7892
05:15:39,900 --> 05:15:41,420
Oh, fucking bro!

7893
05:15:42,760 --> 05:15:43,740
Get your knife!

7894
05:15:52,720 --> 05:15:55,140
Okay, so apparently there was a...

7895
05:15:55,700 --> 05:15:57,440
Why are you fucking kidding?

7896
05:16:00,500 --> 05:16:00,980
Bro!

7897
05:16:01,960 --> 05:16:02,920
This is not fair.

7898
05:16:03,340 --> 05:16:04,400
This is not fair.

7899
05:16:04,460 --> 05:16:06,480
There should not be a way for you to get over here.

7900
05:16:06,900 --> 05:16:07,940
This is not fair.

7901
05:16:08,580 --> 05:16:10,380
This is absolutely not fair.

7902
05:16:10,420 --> 05:16:11,100
This fucking sucks.

7903
05:16:11,440 --> 05:16:12,520
This fucking sucks.

7904
05:16:14,580 --> 05:16:15,540
Just keep running.

7905
05:16:15,680 --> 05:16:16,640
Okay, try to get over here.

7906
05:16:16,660 --> 05:16:17,300
Just keep running.

7907
05:16:17,480 --> 05:16:18,340
Just keep running.

7908
05:16:18,500 --> 05:16:19,400
Just keep running.

7909
05:16:19,640 --> 05:16:20,600
Just keep running.

7910
05:16:20,660 --> 05:16:21,500
Just keep running.

7911
05:16:21,760 --> 05:16:22,680
Just keep running.

7912
05:16:22,760 --> 05:16:24,380
Just keep running.

7913
05:16:24,560 --> 05:16:25,840
Maybe if I go down here.

7914
05:16:26,440 --> 05:16:27,380
Is this sanctuary?

7915
05:16:27,840 --> 05:16:29,120
This is not sanctuary.

7916
05:16:29,220 --> 05:16:30,500
This is loot.

7917
05:16:31,040 --> 05:16:32,480
This is just loot.

7918
05:16:33,380 --> 05:16:34,980
Oh my god!

7919
05:16:35,540 --> 05:16:36,140
Bro!

7920
05:16:37,920 --> 05:16:39,120
No, please!

7921
05:16:41,020 --> 05:16:42,800
No, let me up.

7922
05:16:43,000 --> 05:16:44,280
Let me up.

7923
05:16:44,280 --> 05:16:44,900
Oh!

7924
05:16:45,920 --> 05:16:46,900
Wait, what?

7925
05:16:47,560 --> 05:16:48,540
Wait, what?

7926
05:16:49,320 --> 05:16:50,200
Is this way?

7927
05:16:50,480 --> 05:16:51,360
Is this way?

7928
05:16:51,840 --> 05:16:52,200
Is this way?

7929
05:16:52,300 --> 05:16:53,200
Lever time!

7930
05:16:55,700 --> 05:16:56,900
Okay, lever time.

7931
05:16:57,160 --> 05:16:57,820
Lever time.

7932
05:16:58,000 --> 05:16:59,880
And then I dropped down!

7933
05:17:00,140 --> 05:17:01,560
I did this out of order.

7934
05:17:03,380 --> 05:17:05,000
I did this out of... What?

7935
05:17:05,420 --> 05:17:06,260
What do you mean?

7936
05:17:06,720 --> 05:17:08,440
What do you mean?

7937
05:17:08,520 --> 05:17:10,040
What do I do from here?

7938
05:17:10,120 --> 05:17:11,540
Why am I trapped here?

7939
05:17:11,540 --> 05:17:13,160
Why am I trapped here?

7940
05:17:19,040 --> 05:17:19,480
Okay.

7941
05:17:21,900 --> 05:17:22,340
No.

7942
05:17:22,480 --> 05:17:23,420
Oh, thank god you died.

7943
05:17:23,560 --> 05:17:23,760
Okay.

7944
05:17:24,300 --> 05:17:27,180
Alright, we're gonna figure out this puzzle together.

7945
05:17:30,240 --> 05:17:32,320
I did this all out of order.

7946
05:17:35,020 --> 05:17:35,760
Okay, he...

7947
05:17:35,760 --> 05:17:38,360
He threw the... I'm gonna wait for him to throw one more time.

7948
05:17:38,520 --> 05:17:41,380
I'm gonna wait for him to throw one more time.

7949
05:17:41,920 --> 05:17:43,440
There's treasure in that room!

7950
05:17:43,960 --> 05:17:45,780
Okay, now we go back in.

7951
05:17:45,940 --> 05:17:46,800
Now we go...

7952
05:17:46,800 --> 05:17:47,440
I'm panicking!

7953
05:17:48,240 --> 05:17:48,980
There is!

7954
05:17:49,900 --> 05:17:50,760
Okay, nice.

7955
05:17:51,120 --> 05:17:51,640
Alright.

7956
05:17:51,940 --> 05:17:53,120
Guys, I'm panicking.

7957
05:17:53,120 --> 05:17:54,800
I am panicking so fucking hard.

7958
05:17:55,100 --> 05:17:56,820
Brain no work when I panic.

7959
05:17:57,400 --> 05:17:58,240
Wait, the music stopped.

7960
05:17:58,400 --> 05:17:59,480
Is he like, tired?

7961
05:18:00,060 --> 05:18:01,020
He's not tired.

7962
05:18:02,240 --> 05:18:03,460
He was not tired.

7963
05:18:05,280 --> 05:18:07,300
He was not tired, chat.

7964
05:18:07,620 --> 05:18:09,560
He was absolutely not tired.

7965
05:18:09,660 --> 05:18:10,480
But it's okay!

7966
05:18:10,600 --> 05:18:11,260
I keep going!

7967
05:18:11,260 --> 05:18:12,760
Just keep running!

7968
05:18:15,520 --> 05:18:17,060
Just keep running.

7969
05:18:17,300 --> 05:18:18,200
Just keep running.

7970
05:18:20,000 --> 05:18:21,280
Just keep running.

7971
05:18:22,160 --> 05:18:23,540
You'll get there eventually.

7972
05:18:23,760 --> 05:18:26,200
I could've just knifed that, but I don't... I'm panicking.

7973
05:18:26,700 --> 05:18:28,800
I could've literally just knifed it.

7974
05:18:29,200 --> 05:18:30,820
And not worried about anything.

7975
05:18:31,420 --> 05:18:32,680
Oh my god, bro.

7976
05:18:32,800 --> 05:18:33,620
What the fuck?

7977
05:18:33,900 --> 05:18:35,040
What are you doing here?

7978
05:18:36,620 --> 05:18:37,920
I'm gonna... I'm gonna shake you.

7979
05:18:38,320 --> 05:18:39,500
Bro, I'm gonna...

7980
05:18:39,500 --> 05:18:39,840
Oh!

7981
05:18:47,790 --> 05:18:50,370
Bro, you guys don't deserve bullets.

7982
05:18:53,660 --> 05:18:54,570
We're good, we're okay.

7983
05:18:54,830 --> 05:18:59,150
The best part about the archers is that they don't deserve the bullet.

7984
05:18:59,660 --> 05:19:01,970
Like, I can just shake them and they'll be fine.

7985
05:19:03,850 --> 05:19:05,050
That's the best part.

7986
05:19:05,150 --> 05:19:06,750
I don't have to worry about...

7987
05:19:07,490 --> 05:19:10,410
I don't have to worry about wasting my ammo.

7988
05:19:11,970 --> 05:19:14,230
I knew how to do combat!

7989
05:19:16,070 --> 05:19:17,750
I've always known!

7990
05:19:18,090 --> 05:19:18,890
What do you mean?

7991
05:19:19,330 --> 05:19:22,850
I just don't want them to get close to me!

7992
05:19:25,170 --> 05:19:26,270
That's different!

7993
05:19:29,690 --> 05:19:30,610
I'm looking this way.

7994
05:19:31,730 --> 05:19:32,410
Nice.

7995
05:19:32,610 --> 05:19:35,530
Where is he?

7996
05:19:35,530 --> 05:19:35,570
Let's see.

7997
05:19:36,750 --> 05:19:38,090
Oh god, thank god.

7998
05:19:38,230 --> 05:19:38,450
Okay.

7999
05:19:39,070 --> 05:19:41,210
Holy shit, that was so long!

8000
05:19:41,290 --> 05:19:42,830
It took so long to move the cannon!

8001
05:19:43,030 --> 05:19:45,470
Who would've thought cannons are super fucking heavy?

8002
05:19:45,750 --> 05:19:47,090
Who would've fucking thought?

8003
05:19:50,390 --> 05:19:52,930
Oh my god, cannons are heavy!

8004
05:19:55,370 --> 05:19:59,750
It took so fucking long to move that... Okay, here we go.

8005
05:20:03,130 --> 05:20:04,030
Down, Ako.

8006
05:20:05,530 --> 05:20:06,210
Let me shoot the door.

8007
05:20:06,390 --> 05:20:07,690
Oh, but then I can shoot this.

8008
05:20:11,150 --> 05:20:12,510
Alright, down I go.

8009
05:20:13,530 --> 05:20:15,050
I'm not done with the cannon?

8010
05:20:17,550 --> 05:20:17,990
Oh.

8011
05:20:17,990 --> 05:20:18,430
Okay.

8012
05:20:20,230 --> 05:20:22,830
I never know when I'm done with the cannon.

8013
05:20:22,970 --> 05:20:24,150
Wait, what the fuck?

8014
05:20:24,210 --> 05:20:25,610
Where did these guys come from?

8015
05:20:31,200 --> 05:20:33,320
Oh, it's nice that they're turning their backs for me.

8016
05:20:37,370 --> 05:20:37,810
Hello.

8017
05:20:38,950 --> 05:20:39,390
Hello.

8018
05:20:39,510 --> 05:20:39,810
Hello.

8019
05:20:40,470 --> 05:20:40,950
Goodbye.

8020
05:20:43,010 --> 05:20:45,970
Okay, maybe they turn around when they hit this area.

8021
05:20:46,230 --> 05:20:47,530
Did they actually turn around?

8022
05:20:48,610 --> 05:20:50,310
What if I shoot you in the legs?

8023
05:20:50,470 --> 05:20:51,270
Oh, no!

8024
05:20:51,390 --> 05:20:52,130
It doesn't work!

8025
05:20:52,210 --> 05:20:52,830
Leg doesn't work!

8026
05:20:54,350 --> 05:20:56,210
But do you turn around after?

8027
05:20:56,570 --> 05:20:57,550
You do!

8028
05:20:58,690 --> 05:20:59,570
That's great!

8029
05:21:00,430 --> 05:21:01,910
You actually do turn around.

8030
05:21:04,470 --> 05:21:05,210
There we go.

8031
05:21:05,670 --> 05:21:06,190
Nice.

8032
05:21:07,330 --> 05:21:07,510
Nice.

8033
05:21:09,550 --> 05:21:09,990
Alright.

8034
05:21:11,070 --> 05:21:13,310
We go back to the cannon, apparently.

8035
05:21:15,650 --> 05:21:16,750
Where did the cannon go?

8036
05:21:17,930 --> 05:21:20,490
Alright, I keep forgetting about the door.

8037
05:21:22,290 --> 05:21:25,370
Guys, it's so heavy to move the fucking cannon.

8038
05:21:30,310 --> 05:21:33,190
Oh my god, Ako shot the cannon at them like last time!

8039
05:21:33,250 --> 05:21:33,630
You're right!

8040
05:21:35,110 --> 05:21:36,110
Could've just done that.

8041
05:21:36,530 --> 05:21:38,070
That would've made it so much easier.

8042
05:21:38,710 --> 05:21:40,470
I always make things harder for myself.

8043
05:21:41,410 --> 05:21:42,610
Why do I keep doing that?

8044
05:21:42,630 --> 05:21:42,790
Wait.

8045
05:21:43,070 --> 05:21:44,870
There's loot here that I'm missing.

8046
05:21:47,330 --> 05:21:48,250
Where is that?

8047
05:21:49,290 --> 05:21:49,730
Here?

8048
05:21:53,450 --> 05:21:55,270
There's somewhere here that has loot.

8049
05:21:55,530 --> 05:21:56,210
Oh, here it is.

8050
05:21:56,370 --> 05:21:57,090
I don't have a key.

8051
05:21:57,150 --> 05:21:57,830
God damn it.

8052
05:21:57,870 --> 05:21:58,730
I never have the key.

8053
05:22:02,370 --> 05:22:04,310
Okay, I'm just gonna reload everything.

8054
05:22:04,830 --> 05:22:06,870
I never have the key for stuff.

8055
05:22:07,850 --> 05:22:08,710
Okay, shotgun.

8056
05:22:08,890 --> 05:22:09,090
Wait.

8057
05:22:09,630 --> 05:22:10,130
Shotgun.

8058
05:22:11,390 --> 05:22:11,910
Okay.

8059
05:22:17,100 --> 05:22:19,260
Throwing a cannon at the chest.

8060
05:22:22,000 --> 05:22:23,040
Okay, just shoot.

8061
05:22:23,220 --> 05:22:23,740
AHHHHH!

8062
05:22:24,020 --> 05:22:24,500
FUCK!

8063
05:22:28,860 --> 05:22:29,940
Oh my god.

8064
05:22:30,060 --> 05:22:32,980
Oh no, please don't tell me it's Crash Bandicoot.

8065
05:22:33,500 --> 05:22:34,020
No.

8066
05:22:35,020 --> 05:22:35,840
Oh, he's dead.

8067
05:22:35,940 --> 05:22:37,000
Okay, I just can't go back.

8068
05:22:39,300 --> 05:22:40,300
Oh my god.

8069
05:22:43,100 --> 05:22:46,980
Oh, I thought I had to do a Crash Bandicoot or some shit.

8070
05:22:47,120 --> 05:22:47,720
Thank god.

8071
05:22:49,960 --> 05:22:51,140
Thank god I live.

8072
05:22:53,260 --> 05:22:54,040
I lived.

8073
05:22:56,700 --> 05:22:58,060
Alright, anything in here?

8074
05:22:58,220 --> 05:22:58,480
No.

8075
05:23:00,080 --> 05:23:00,600
Alright.

8076
05:23:00,860 --> 05:23:02,280
Oh my gosh, is this the garden?

8077
05:23:02,380 --> 05:23:02,940
Is this the maze?

8078
05:23:03,060 --> 05:23:04,460
God fucking damn it.

8079
05:23:04,540 --> 05:23:05,340
It's the fucking...

8080
05:23:05,340 --> 05:23:07,180
Oh my god, it's the dog maze.

8081
05:23:07,820 --> 05:23:09,220
It's super dog time.

8082
05:23:10,300 --> 05:23:12,280
Oh no, not super.

8083
05:23:12,280 --> 05:23:12,720
Super dog.

8084
05:23:13,240 --> 05:23:16,240
Oh my god, not super dog.

8085
05:23:16,320 --> 05:23:16,760
Bro.

8086
05:23:19,780 --> 05:23:22,180
Bro, not super dog.

8087
05:23:29,280 --> 05:23:30,960
God damn.

8088
05:23:31,340 --> 05:23:31,760
Alright.

8089
05:23:33,420 --> 05:23:35,300
It's super dog time.

8090
05:23:39,820 --> 05:23:40,260
Ashley!

8091
05:23:41,400 --> 05:23:41,840
Ashley?

8092
05:23:43,140 --> 05:23:45,140
Ashley, I know it was just a phase, Ashley.

8093
05:23:45,940 --> 05:23:47,340
I know you didn't mean it.

8094
05:23:47,420 --> 05:23:49,620
I know you didn't mean it when you took my $100,000 knife.

8095
05:23:54,080 --> 05:23:55,580
Bro, you're a little girl.

8096
05:23:55,760 --> 05:23:57,840
You're gonna hurt yourself before you hurt me.

8097
05:23:58,180 --> 05:23:58,220
I'm so scared.

8098
05:24:02,320 --> 05:24:04,060
It wasn't myself anymore.

8099
05:24:05,060 --> 05:24:06,600
It was something else.

8100
05:24:07,080 --> 05:24:08,240
Ashley must have been terrifying.

8101
05:24:08,280 --> 05:24:08,820
I know.

8102
05:24:12,240 --> 05:24:13,040
You too.

8103
05:24:13,780 --> 05:24:14,560
I'm warbing.

8104
05:24:17,800 --> 05:24:19,140
It's okay to be afraid, you know.

8105
05:24:22,320 --> 05:24:23,640
And I'm warbed soon.

8106
05:24:25,600 --> 05:24:26,120
You can't.

8107
05:24:26,120 --> 05:24:26,960
You gotta keep moving forward.

8108
05:24:29,040 --> 05:24:30,200
We will beat this.

8109
05:24:31,840 --> 05:24:32,320
Together.

8110
05:24:35,880 --> 05:24:37,380
I don't know if I can.

8111
05:24:37,460 --> 05:24:37,860
You can.

8112
05:24:45,020 --> 05:24:47,300
Just yell out that you're gonna shank.

8113
05:24:47,360 --> 05:24:47,940
Just like me!

8114
05:24:53,480 --> 05:24:55,280
Just be like a Pokemon.

8115
05:24:58,180 --> 05:24:59,240
Ooh, nice.

8116
05:25:00,680 --> 05:25:02,040
92%!

8117
05:25:02,380 --> 05:25:03,520
Look at that!

8118
05:25:03,900 --> 05:25:05,240
Look at that!

8119
05:25:05,660 --> 05:25:07,220
Bro, I'm fucking gaming, man.

8120
05:25:07,220 --> 05:25:09,080
I'm fucking gaming.

8121
05:25:11,680 --> 05:25:12,660
Alright, we're...

8122
05:25:13,600 --> 05:25:15,040
Seven more chapters!

8123
05:25:16,100 --> 05:25:17,560
Alright, we're kicking good time.

8124
05:25:17,800 --> 05:25:18,740
We got to chapter 9.

8125
05:25:37,340 --> 05:25:41,460
Oh my god, can I make Ashley hide in the locker before I fucking do the...

8126
05:25:43,580 --> 05:25:44,560
Yes, I can.

8127
05:25:44,740 --> 05:25:45,860
I absolutely can.

8128
05:25:46,100 --> 05:25:47,320
Ashley, you don't understand.

8129
05:25:48,380 --> 05:25:50,920
I will run away the moment there's trouble.

8130
05:25:53,620 --> 05:25:56,280
There is 100% chance I can leave.

8131
05:26:00,420 --> 05:26:01,500
No, it's not.

8132
05:26:01,620 --> 05:26:02,140
Get closer.

8133
05:26:04,440 --> 05:26:06,800
Can we get to- I'm pretty sure I'm gonna get a buzz.

8134
05:26:07,220 --> 05:26:07,940
Save 100.

8135
05:26:08,660 --> 05:26:10,180
I'm pretty sure.

8136
05:26:11,900 --> 05:26:12,780
Oh no.

8137
05:26:12,860 --> 05:26:15,300
Wait, is Ashley coming with me to the dog maze?

8138
05:26:16,900 --> 05:26:17,500
No!

8139
05:26:18,740 --> 05:26:19,800
Ashley, no.

8140
05:26:20,280 --> 05:26:21,380
Ashley, no.

8141
05:26:21,960 --> 05:26:22,560
No.

8142
05:26:22,820 --> 05:26:23,420
Why?

8143
05:26:23,620 --> 05:26:26,180
Why must you come with me to the maze?

8144
05:26:27,520 --> 05:26:29,280
Can you please get kidnapped?

8145
05:26:30,320 --> 05:26:34,620
Ashley, please can you get kidnapped right now before I go to the maze?

8146
05:26:36,880 --> 05:26:37,440
Please.

8147
05:26:37,460 --> 05:26:37,740
Please.

8148
05:26:37,740 --> 05:26:39,100
I am directionless.

8149
05:26:41,620 --> 05:26:42,520
Ashley, please.

8150
05:26:42,660 --> 05:26:44,660
I am so bad with mazes, Ashley.

8151
05:26:44,740 --> 05:26:46,900
I really can't have you with me right now.

8152
05:26:47,120 --> 05:26:50,600
I am so bad with mazes, Ashley.

8153
05:26:50,760 --> 05:26:51,240
I swear.

8154
05:26:54,960 --> 05:26:57,360
All right, they owe me money.

8155
05:26:57,980 --> 05:26:59,300
Those fucking crows.

8156
05:26:59,520 --> 05:27:00,740
I'll never forget.

8157
05:27:00,740 --> 05:27:01,000
I'll never forget.

8158
05:27:03,360 --> 05:27:05,180
These crows owe me money.

8159
05:27:08,500 --> 05:27:10,100
Oh fucking god.

8160
05:27:10,220 --> 05:27:11,800
Okay, we got figure this out.

8161
05:27:12,100 --> 05:27:15,680
We have figured this shit out...

8162
05:27:20,980 --> 05:27:23,060
All right, we got one of them.

8163
05:27:27,020 --> 05:27:28,160
God, no.

8164
05:27:28,460 --> 05:27:29,040
Oh no!

8165
05:27:29,880 --> 05:27:30,460
No.

8166
05:27:32,400 --> 05:27:33,560
Oh... yeah.

8167
05:27:33,640 --> 05:27:34,200
I got my shotgun.

8168
05:27:34,200 --> 05:27:35,420
I'm ready for super dogs.

8169
05:27:36,200 --> 05:27:37,400
I got it ready.

8170
05:27:37,500 --> 05:27:38,420
I'm so directionless.

8171
05:27:38,460 --> 05:27:39,600
I'm gonna get lost so fast.

8172
05:27:40,660 --> 05:27:42,240
I can feel it already.

8173
05:27:46,430 --> 05:27:50,310
Guys, I can already... Oh god, it's super dog.

8174
05:27:54,780 --> 05:27:56,040
It's super dogs.

8175
05:28:00,620 --> 05:28:01,140
Doggos?

8176
05:28:01,140 --> 05:28:01,980
Where am I?

8177
05:28:03,960 --> 05:28:05,160
Oh, where am I?

8178
05:28:08,740 --> 05:28:10,060
I hear the toy.

8179
05:28:15,620 --> 05:28:17,360
Oh my god, I hate this.

8180
05:28:17,440 --> 05:28:19,160
I hate this so much.

8181
05:28:19,820 --> 05:28:20,900
Where is the toy?

8182
05:28:22,100 --> 05:28:23,640
All right, here we go.

8183
05:28:25,460 --> 05:28:27,480
I like how people are trying to give me directions.

8184
05:28:27,660 --> 05:28:28,640
It's not, guys.

8185
05:28:29,080 --> 05:28:29,840
It's hopeless.

8186
05:28:30,060 --> 05:28:31,340
You know damn well it's hopeless.

8187
05:28:32,680 --> 05:28:33,960
You can't fix this.

8188
05:28:34,340 --> 05:28:38,740
I know you guys think you can fix this, but you can never fix this.

8189
05:28:39,300 --> 05:28:40,040
I will...

8190
05:28:40,040 --> 05:28:41,600
I will forever be directionless.

8191
05:28:44,060 --> 05:28:45,660
There's no fixing this.

8192
05:28:47,020 --> 05:28:49,200
Oh god, I hear the super dogs.

8193
05:28:50,780 --> 05:28:51,960
I hear them.

8194
05:28:51,980 --> 05:28:52,940
They're to my right.

8195
05:28:54,940 --> 05:28:56,240
Oh, that's all of them.

8196
05:28:56,480 --> 05:28:57,460
Wait, if I kill...

8197
05:28:57,460 --> 05:29:00,920
Oh fuck, I thought I was gonna kill all of them now!

8198
05:29:03,760 --> 05:29:05,220
Oh my god!

8199
05:29:05,960 --> 05:29:06,480
Knife!

8200
05:29:06,620 --> 05:29:07,320
Kitchen knife!

8201
05:29:07,320 --> 05:29:07,460
Knife!

8202
05:29:09,180 --> 05:29:14,400
I was like, okay, if I kill all of them before they got out...

8203
05:29:17,940 --> 05:29:19,240
It didn't work.

8204
05:29:19,300 --> 05:29:22,520
I didn't manage to kill all of them before they...

8205
05:29:22,520 --> 05:29:23,380
Who would have thought?

8206
05:29:23,780 --> 05:29:27,240
Who would have thought I didn't kill all of them before they got out?

8207
05:29:30,940 --> 05:29:31,980
Wow, Doki.

8208
05:29:33,100 --> 05:29:33,860
Super dog.

8209
05:29:34,040 --> 05:29:35,060
Super dog is coming.

8210
05:29:35,660 --> 05:29:36,960
Super dog is coming.

8211
05:29:41,180 --> 05:29:41,940
Which way?

8212
05:29:46,860 --> 05:29:48,100
Which way are they coming?

8213
05:29:51,440 --> 05:29:53,180
I hear them, but which way?

8214
05:29:55,080 --> 05:29:55,880
This way!

8215
05:29:56,600 --> 05:29:57,880
I fucking knew it.

8216
05:30:00,720 --> 05:30:01,900
I fucking knew it.

8217
05:30:01,900 --> 05:30:02,480
You can't hide.

8218
05:30:02,680 --> 05:30:04,040
You can't hide from me.

8219
05:30:05,700 --> 05:30:06,540
God, okay, wait.

8220
05:30:06,640 --> 05:30:07,740
How much ammo do I have?

8221
05:30:07,880 --> 05:30:08,660
Okay, we got a...

8222
05:30:08,660 --> 05:30:10,120
Yeah, we definitely need a shotgun.

8223
05:30:10,140 --> 05:30:11,180
I'm gonna go get a shotgun.

8224
05:30:11,380 --> 05:30:11,640
I'm gonna go get a shotgun.

8225
05:30:11,640 --> 05:30:11,700
I'm gonna go get a shotgun.

8226
05:30:12,460 --> 05:30:12,980
Okay.

8227
05:30:18,440 --> 05:30:19,780
Oh my god, they found me.

8228
05:30:22,280 --> 05:30:23,020
There you go.

8229
05:30:23,020 --> 05:30:25,060
That's fucking right, idiot.

8230
05:30:25,420 --> 05:30:26,200
Oh shit!

8231
05:30:26,920 --> 05:30:28,200
Oh, okay, he doesn't know.

8232
05:30:28,360 --> 05:30:29,500
He doesn't know.

8233
05:30:29,700 --> 05:30:30,500
We're embattled.

8234
05:30:32,340 --> 05:30:33,680
He's just as lost.

8235
05:30:34,140 --> 05:30:36,420
The dogs are just as lost as me.

8236
05:30:40,530 --> 05:30:41,650
Oh, hey, chessboard.

8237
05:30:41,770 --> 05:30:42,250
Nice.

8238
05:30:42,410 --> 05:30:43,030
That's money.

8239
05:30:45,910 --> 05:30:47,130
Sweet, thank you for the super chat.

8240
05:30:47,210 --> 05:30:47,910
Thank you, thank you.

8241
05:30:48,010 --> 05:30:49,790
Okay, the tiredness is taking me now.

8242
05:30:49,930 --> 05:30:51,150
Thanks for the stream, Doki.

8243
05:30:51,370 --> 05:30:52,270
It has been very fun.

8244
05:30:52,410 --> 05:30:53,710
I'll watch the rest of the VOD tomorrow.

8245
05:30:53,870 --> 05:30:55,530
Alright, thank you for watching so far!

8246
05:30:56,590 --> 05:30:57,890
We had a great time.

8247
05:30:57,930 --> 05:30:58,750
Have a good rest.

8248
05:30:58,910 --> 05:30:59,630
Thank you for the super chat.

8249
05:31:00,590 --> 05:31:00,930
Dog?

8250
05:31:01,710 --> 05:31:02,610
Oh my god.

8251
05:31:02,690 --> 05:31:03,450
Okay, he run.

8252
05:31:05,750 --> 05:31:06,890
No, god damn it.

8253
05:31:07,610 --> 05:31:08,470
God damn it.

8254
05:31:09,330 --> 05:31:10,890
He just fucking came in here.

8255
05:31:11,170 --> 05:31:12,390
He should try and gank me.

8256
05:31:19,650 --> 05:31:20,170
Okay.

8257
05:31:21,410 --> 05:31:23,090
I think... you think I didn't see that?

8258
05:31:23,710 --> 05:31:25,250
You think I didn't see that dog?

8259
05:31:25,470 --> 05:31:26,750
Wait, did I kill him?

8260
05:31:27,770 --> 05:31:29,890
Did I like accidentally kill him?

8261
05:31:32,410 --> 05:31:34,670
He like just passed out at the end.

8262
05:31:34,790 --> 05:31:35,310
Nice.

8263
05:31:36,070 --> 05:31:36,590
Good.

8264
05:31:38,450 --> 05:31:43,110
I actually accidentally... accidentally shot him.

8265
05:31:44,810 --> 05:31:46,130
Where is this area?

8266
05:31:47,010 --> 05:31:48,310
God, I'm so lost.

8267
05:31:53,090 --> 05:31:54,050
Where am I?

8268
05:31:54,570 --> 05:31:55,590
Okay, there's loot.

8269
05:31:56,510 --> 05:31:57,470
I'm so lost.

8270
05:31:59,230 --> 05:32:01,390
I remember we were stuck here for so long.

8271
05:32:02,010 --> 05:32:03,930
Because I kept getting... Did I do this already?

8272
05:32:04,930 --> 05:32:06,030
Yes, this is the beginning.

8273
05:32:11,230 --> 05:32:12,110
This is...

8274
05:32:12,910 --> 05:32:13,910
This is the beginning.

8275
05:32:14,010 --> 05:32:14,630
This here, here.

8276
05:32:14,710 --> 05:32:15,450
We didn't go here.

8277
05:32:16,990 --> 05:32:17,750
I knew it.

8278
05:32:18,650 --> 05:32:19,730
There's a... there's a box.

8279
05:32:20,330 --> 05:32:21,150
Yellow box.

8280
05:32:23,490 --> 05:32:24,230
Here we go.

8281
05:32:25,450 --> 05:32:26,550
That's fucking right.

8282
05:32:29,430 --> 05:32:30,770
Oh my god.

8283
05:32:30,910 --> 05:32:32,610
Get out of here, super dogs.

8284
05:32:33,610 --> 05:32:34,410
Oh no.

8285
05:32:35,110 --> 05:32:36,770
Oh, that's a lot of super dogs.

8286
05:32:39,590 --> 05:32:40,250
Oh god.

8287
05:32:41,010 --> 05:32:41,990
Okay, there we go.

8288
05:32:42,710 --> 05:32:43,830
Okay, there we go.

8289
05:32:43,830 --> 05:32:49,550
I killed them before they got me, and they got a flash grenade.

8290
05:32:50,170 --> 05:32:50,690
Let's go.

8291
05:32:57,440 --> 05:32:58,660
Wait a minute.

8292
05:32:59,700 --> 05:33:00,960
I hear a dog.

8293
05:33:01,060 --> 05:33:02,480
Don't think I didn't know they're here.

8294
05:33:02,540 --> 05:33:03,000
I hear...

8295
05:33:03,000 --> 05:33:03,940
I play Apex.

8296
05:33:07,200 --> 05:33:08,700
I hear everything.

8297
05:33:09,280 --> 05:33:09,840
Hold this down.

8298
05:33:09,980 --> 05:33:10,620
Hold this down.

8299
05:33:12,720 --> 05:33:15,360
Don't think I can't hear your fucking footsteps.

8300
05:33:19,760 --> 05:33:21,040
That's fucking right.

8301
05:33:21,500 --> 05:33:22,420
Be careful?

8302
05:33:22,700 --> 05:33:23,200
Of what?

8303
05:33:24,040 --> 05:33:26,600
Okay, I don't like that you told me to be careful.

8304
05:33:27,780 --> 05:33:29,380
Because be careful of what?

8305
05:33:30,240 --> 05:33:32,340
What do I need to be careful of?

8306
05:33:37,070 --> 05:33:38,550
Yeah, I have the sound DLC.

8307
05:33:38,790 --> 05:33:44,130
If you're a good little boy, you too can get the sound DLC.

8308
05:33:45,590 --> 05:33:48,170
That means you are all bad little boys and girls.

8309
05:33:48,170 --> 05:33:50,290
Are you fucking kidding me?

8310
05:33:50,370 --> 05:33:52,110
Where are you Ashley?

8311
05:33:53,110 --> 05:33:54,050
Ashley, run!

8312
05:33:55,830 --> 05:33:56,210
Ashley!

8313
05:33:56,430 --> 05:33:57,070
Ashley!

8314
05:33:59,410 --> 05:34:01,670
Ashley, where did you go?

8315
05:34:06,010 --> 05:34:06,770
No!

8316
05:34:07,030 --> 05:34:09,050
No fucking way!

8317
05:34:12,690 --> 05:34:15,090
No fucking way!

8318
05:34:18,170 --> 05:34:20,210
Oh my... I'm gonna shoot you in the fucking feet.

8319
05:34:21,690 --> 05:34:24,150
Oh shit, that's the wrong one that I shot.

8320
05:34:26,150 --> 05:34:27,610
There's dogs again!

8321
05:34:31,580 --> 05:34:32,060
Shit!

8322
05:34:39,840 --> 05:34:41,080
Okay, there we go.

8323
05:34:41,380 --> 05:34:44,120
I was gonna say, why are there dogs again?

8324
05:34:46,040 --> 05:34:46,920
Okay, there we go.

8325
05:34:47,220 --> 05:34:48,480
You should be dead dead.

8326
05:34:48,620 --> 05:34:49,560
Okay, thank god.

8327
05:34:50,040 --> 05:34:51,800
There's always dogs.

8328
05:34:54,100 --> 05:34:54,780
Not the dogs.

8329
05:34:54,780 --> 05:34:56,640
Not the dogs.

8330
05:34:57,840 --> 05:34:59,700
Are you fucking... where's the dogs?

8331
05:35:00,040 --> 05:35:00,500
Where...

8332
05:35:02,940 --> 05:35:05,040
Oh, it's a freaking dog!

8333
05:35:06,300 --> 05:35:06,980
Okay!

8334
05:35:09,100 --> 05:35:10,080
I can't.

8335
05:35:10,460 --> 05:35:12,040
I really can't.

8336
05:35:12,080 --> 05:35:13,860
I can't deal with these.

8337
05:35:15,180 --> 05:35:17,140
I don't have the ammo.

8338
05:35:17,320 --> 05:35:18,460
I can't.

8339
05:35:18,460 --> 05:35:21,420
I don't... I'm fucking broke right now, Ashley.

8340
05:35:21,520 --> 05:35:21,780
I'm fucking broke right now, Ashley.

8341
05:35:24,440 --> 05:35:25,900
Okay, I think we're good.

8342
05:35:27,240 --> 05:35:28,600
I think we did it.

8343
05:35:28,820 --> 05:35:28,840
I think we did it.

8344
05:35:29,620 --> 05:35:30,040
Okay.

8345
05:35:31,580 --> 05:35:32,900
Are you fucking... where?

8346
05:35:33,060 --> 05:35:33,440
Where?

8347
05:35:33,640 --> 05:35:34,680
How are you alive?

8348
05:35:38,780 --> 05:35:40,080
Are you okay?

8349
05:35:40,460 --> 05:35:40,980
No.

8350
05:35:42,680 --> 05:35:45,680
This fucking random dog that just ran away.

8351
05:35:46,980 --> 05:35:47,500
Train.

8352
05:35:47,860 --> 05:35:48,740
What's this?

8353
05:35:49,720 --> 05:35:51,520
For toilet... these are three...

8354
05:35:51,520 --> 05:35:52,040
Oh, okay.

8355
05:35:52,100 --> 05:35:52,680
It's just money.

8356
05:35:53,560 --> 05:35:55,900
How have we procured these curiosities?

8357
05:35:56,500 --> 05:35:57,640
These are all...

8358
05:35:57,640 --> 05:35:58,480
I don't have enough.

8359
05:35:59,240 --> 05:36:01,120
There hasn't been like a mission.

8360
05:36:01,720 --> 05:36:02,320
Upgrade!

8361
05:36:02,720 --> 05:36:03,180
Okay.

8362
05:36:07,780 --> 05:36:09,540
We definitely need to do this.

8363
05:36:09,880 --> 05:36:10,700
All right.

8364
05:36:10,840 --> 05:36:11,800
Oh shit!

8365
05:36:11,920 --> 05:36:13,420
Oh my god.

8366
05:36:13,600 --> 05:36:14,300
There's so much!

8367
05:36:14,600 --> 05:36:14,860
Okay.

8368
05:36:14,900 --> 05:36:15,720
Exclusive time.

8369
05:36:16,000 --> 05:36:17,140
We can sell.

8370
05:36:17,200 --> 05:36:17,600
We can sell.

8371
05:36:17,900 --> 05:36:18,500
Sell.

8372
05:36:19,260 --> 05:36:19,600
Sell.

8373
05:36:20,620 --> 05:36:23,540
We need two... we have all this stuff.

8374
05:36:23,560 --> 05:36:24,120
All different!

8375
05:36:24,380 --> 05:36:28,280
Okay, let me sell these first and then we can...

8376
05:36:28,760 --> 05:36:31,500
Uh, an extraordinary... Okay, imp that.

8377
05:36:31,720 --> 05:36:31,940
Alright.

8378
05:36:32,080 --> 05:36:35,400
If it's all different, do we... 5 gems... How many gems?

8379
05:36:35,540 --> 05:36:36,320
1, 2, 3, 4?

8380
05:36:37,220 --> 05:36:39,820
Uh, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 1.6.

8381
05:36:40,060 --> 05:36:41,800
I don't think we're gonna find...

8382
05:36:42,400 --> 05:36:45,740
Uh, I don't think we're gonna find like 4 of a kind.

8383
05:36:45,940 --> 05:36:46,760
I don't think so.

8384
05:36:46,820 --> 05:36:48,860
I think that's like almost impossible at this point.

8385
05:36:49,480 --> 05:36:49,920
So...

8386
05:36:50,480 --> 05:36:51,860
We can have 1, 2...

8387
05:36:51,860 --> 05:36:53,140
Oh yeah, there's no way.

8388
05:36:53,380 --> 05:36:54,600
Yeah, there's definitely no way.

8389
05:36:54,920 --> 05:36:56,240
There's no way we can get that.

8390
05:36:56,300 --> 05:36:57,560
We can have all of this though.

8391
05:36:58,660 --> 05:36:59,760
The different colors.

8392
05:37:03,280 --> 05:37:04,160
And then...

8393
05:37:06,020 --> 05:37:07,320
Stonks going up right now.

8394
05:37:07,360 --> 05:37:07,780
Look at that.

8395
05:37:08,620 --> 05:37:09,060
BAM!

8396
05:37:10,580 --> 05:37:11,100
Oh, yeah.

8397
05:37:12,300 --> 05:37:13,180
51,000!

8398
05:37:13,880 --> 05:37:16,060
Yeah, we're fucking... stonks going up.

8399
05:37:16,840 --> 05:37:19,360
Oh my god, time to use it all up.

8400
05:37:20,360 --> 05:37:21,620
Okay, we're gonna...

8401
05:37:22,760 --> 05:37:24,140
Repair our knife.

8402
05:37:25,060 --> 05:37:27,880
And then we're gonna upgrade our pistol.

8403
05:37:29,080 --> 05:37:29,640
And...

8404
05:37:29,640 --> 05:37:31,320
Our shotgun.

8405
05:37:32,340 --> 05:37:34,680
And our rifle.

8406
05:37:37,670 --> 05:37:38,480
Yeah, I think so.

8407
05:37:38,660 --> 05:37:39,100
Power.

8408
05:37:40,330 --> 05:37:42,080
Since these are like our most...

8409
05:37:42,350 --> 05:37:44,920
Uh, our most fucking used guns.

8410
05:37:47,650 --> 05:37:50,260
Yeah, I already fixed my armor already.

8411
05:37:50,400 --> 05:37:50,940
We're fine.

8412
05:37:50,940 --> 05:37:52,360
Armour's been fixed.

8413
05:37:52,940 --> 05:37:54,860
All that money gone so fast.

8414
05:37:55,440 --> 05:37:57,080
Oh, all that money...

8415
05:37:57,080 --> 05:37:58,460
It's already gone.

8416
05:38:00,540 --> 05:38:03,020
Now I'm back in the lower tax bracket.

8417
05:38:06,040 --> 05:38:07,720
I hear the dog.

8418
05:38:08,060 --> 05:38:09,620
Wait, I just realized...

8419
05:38:09,620 --> 05:38:11,400
I don't even have shotgun shells.

8420
05:38:12,360 --> 05:38:12,920
Okay.

8421
05:38:13,620 --> 05:38:16,220
Are there any fish in the pond or did I kill them all?

8422
05:38:17,280 --> 05:38:18,620
Wait, do they respawn?

8423
05:38:18,880 --> 05:38:20,460
Wait, do the fishes respawn?

8424
05:38:20,480 --> 05:38:20,840
Wait, do they respawn?

8425
05:38:20,840 --> 05:38:20,900
Wait, do the fishes respawn?

8426
05:38:20,900 --> 05:38:20,920
Wait, do the fishes respawn?

8427
05:38:20,920 --> 05:38:21,760
Oh my god.

8428
05:38:21,860 --> 05:38:23,260
This changes everything.

8429
05:38:26,880 --> 05:38:28,960
This changes everything.

8430
05:38:29,680 --> 05:38:32,880
This changes everything.

8431
05:38:33,140 --> 05:38:34,740
Oh my god.

8432
05:38:35,580 --> 05:38:37,420
The fish respawn.

8433
05:38:37,780 --> 05:38:37,980
The fish respawn.

8434
05:38:38,500 --> 05:38:41,540
Yeah, I hear the dog, but he's like not coming out.

8435
05:38:41,860 --> 05:38:41,880
Yeah, I hear the dog, but he's like not coming out.

8436
05:38:43,120 --> 05:38:44,280
Where's the objective?

8437
05:38:44,660 --> 05:38:45,840
I'm so lost.

8438
05:38:47,500 --> 05:38:49,120
How do we get there?

8439
05:38:49,340 --> 05:38:49,460
How do we get there?

8440
05:38:56,220 --> 05:38:57,020
How do we...

8441
05:38:58,180 --> 05:38:59,600
Oh, gap in the wall.

8442
05:39:01,320 --> 05:39:02,260
How do we...

8443
05:39:03,880 --> 05:39:05,040
How do we get there?

8444
05:39:08,200 --> 05:39:08,680
Oh!

8445
05:39:09,160 --> 05:39:11,020
I went the wrong way.

8446
05:39:11,080 --> 05:39:11,200
Oh!

8447
05:39:11,280 --> 05:39:11,280
I went the wrong way.

8448
05:39:11,280 --> 05:39:14,780
Okay, we're just gonna grab the treasure over there first.

8449
05:39:15,140 --> 05:39:15,620
Okay, we're just gonna grab the treasure over there first.

8450
05:39:15,620 --> 05:39:18,140
Yeah, I went the wrong door, guys.

8451
05:39:18,380 --> 05:39:19,260
I just realized.

8452
05:39:19,600 --> 05:39:22,100
But like, there's a treasure over here anyway.

8453
05:39:22,760 --> 05:39:24,140
So... wait, do I have a key?

8454
05:39:24,140 --> 05:39:25,160
I don't have a key.

8455
05:39:25,480 --> 05:39:25,980
Yeah.

8456
05:39:27,960 --> 05:39:29,200
I went the wrong way.

8457
05:39:29,760 --> 05:39:30,620
Classic Doki.

8458
05:39:33,380 --> 05:39:34,200
Where's the dog?

8459
05:39:36,740 --> 05:39:38,320
Where the fuck is the dog?

8460
05:39:41,280 --> 05:39:42,480
Oh, there he is.

8461
05:39:45,420 --> 05:39:46,260
There's the dog.

8462
05:39:46,500 --> 05:39:47,280
There we go.

8463
05:39:48,940 --> 05:39:49,800
You have...

8464
05:39:49,800 --> 05:39:50,960
Oh, it's just money.

8465
05:39:51,060 --> 05:39:51,780
I don't care enough.

8466
05:39:52,600 --> 05:39:54,140
We have to go this way anyway.

8467
05:40:00,260 --> 05:40:01,660
Wait, how do I get there?

8468
05:40:02,620 --> 05:40:03,600
God damn it.

8469
05:40:03,620 --> 05:40:04,360
Where am I?

8470
05:40:04,660 --> 05:40:05,660
Oh, there it is.

8471
05:40:05,680 --> 05:40:06,560
This is where I have to go.

8472
05:40:07,180 --> 05:40:08,200
Wait, oh my god.

8473
05:40:08,220 --> 05:40:09,940
I don't care enough to find that area.

8474
05:40:10,280 --> 05:40:11,700
I don't care enough.

8475
05:40:11,960 --> 05:40:13,300
We're just gonna progress.

8476
05:40:17,530 --> 05:40:18,230
Here we go.

8477
05:40:22,620 --> 05:40:23,440
But the loot...

8478
05:40:23,440 --> 05:40:24,480
We'll go back later!

8479
05:40:25,000 --> 05:40:25,840
We'll go back later!

8480
05:40:25,860 --> 05:40:27,600
It'll be fine!

8481
05:40:28,000 --> 05:40:30,640
And she never goes back later.

8482
05:40:32,620 --> 05:40:33,260
And she never goes back later.

8483
05:40:33,420 --> 05:40:35,600
She never comes back later.

8484
05:40:37,120 --> 05:40:38,860
She never comes back later.

8485
05:40:38,860 --> 05:40:39,180
She never comes back later.

8486
05:40:40,200 --> 05:40:42,000
Get some good news.

8487
05:40:42,100 --> 05:40:43,560
Now I can do more nasty upgrades.

8488
05:40:43,960 --> 05:40:44,560
Nice!

8489
05:40:44,580 --> 05:40:45,860
That's basically what I saw.

8490
05:40:46,500 --> 05:40:48,980
Wait, there's annoying blue medallions.

8491
05:40:48,980 --> 05:40:49,520
Wait, there's annoying blue medallions.

8492
05:40:49,520 --> 05:40:49,820
Oh, okay.

8493
05:40:49,940 --> 05:40:50,560
This is easy.

8494
05:40:52,080 --> 05:40:52,820
That's easy.

8495
05:40:53,020 --> 05:40:54,020
Oh my god!

8496
05:40:54,040 --> 05:40:54,680
It's that thing!

8497
05:40:57,080 --> 05:40:58,020
It's the...

8498
05:40:58,020 --> 05:40:58,700
It's the...

8499
05:41:00,120 --> 05:41:00,660
Bonus!

8500
05:41:00,660 --> 05:41:01,620
We can do this.

8501
05:41:02,080 --> 05:41:02,720
Alright, Ashley.

8502
05:41:02,760 --> 05:41:03,420
It's bonus time.

8503
05:41:05,420 --> 05:41:06,560
It's bonus time.

8504
05:41:07,720 --> 05:41:08,520
This is it.

8505
05:41:08,580 --> 05:41:09,440
Watch this, Ashley.

8506
05:41:10,920 --> 05:41:11,820
Watch this.

8507
05:41:12,840 --> 05:41:13,380
Okay.

8508
05:41:13,440 --> 05:41:16,520
I have not... I've never used a TMP before.

8509
05:41:16,600 --> 05:41:17,920
So this is gonna be interesting.

8510
05:41:22,500 --> 05:41:23,640
Oh, is this pirates?

8511
05:41:23,740 --> 05:41:24,580
Oh, these are all pirates!

8512
05:41:24,620 --> 05:41:24,920
Okay.

8513
05:41:26,440 --> 05:41:27,960
I haven't used these before.

8514
05:41:29,640 --> 05:41:30,280
Okay.

8515
05:41:30,300 --> 05:41:30,640
Okay.

8516
05:41:30,640 --> 05:41:32,160
70 bullets.

8517
05:41:33,040 --> 05:41:34,480
Oh, I don't know!

8518
05:41:34,800 --> 05:41:35,220
Ashley!

8519
05:41:35,480 --> 05:41:36,460
Stop back-seating!

8520
05:41:37,400 --> 05:41:38,040
What?!

8521
05:41:38,700 --> 05:41:39,340
Okay.

8522
05:41:39,540 --> 05:41:40,920
This is a dumb gun.

8523
05:41:41,280 --> 05:41:42,340
This gun sucks.

8524
05:41:44,080 --> 05:41:45,880
How do you headshot that?

8525
05:41:46,100 --> 05:41:46,540
How do you headshot that?

8526
05:41:48,840 --> 05:41:49,480
Okay.

8527
05:41:49,480 --> 05:41:50,120
There's...

8528
05:41:50,860 --> 05:41:51,840
There's no way.

8529
05:41:51,980 --> 05:41:52,980
There's no fucking way.

8530
05:41:52,980 --> 05:41:53,580
There's...

8531
05:41:54,280 --> 05:41:54,800
There's...

8532
05:41:56,680 --> 05:41:57,540
There's no way!

8533
05:41:59,300 --> 05:41:59,820
Okay.

8534
05:42:00,400 --> 05:42:01,540
That's still an A.

8535
05:42:01,800 --> 05:42:02,560
Okay, guys.

8536
05:42:03,220 --> 05:42:04,260
That's still...

8537
05:42:04,980 --> 05:42:06,400
There's a single shot?!

8538
05:42:06,800 --> 05:42:07,060
Okay.

8539
05:42:07,100 --> 05:42:07,640
Right, guys.

8540
05:42:11,380 --> 05:42:11,900
Okay.

8541
05:42:11,980 --> 05:42:12,120
Nice.

8542
05:42:12,320 --> 05:42:12,540
Okay.

8543
05:42:12,560 --> 05:42:13,000
This is easy.

8544
05:42:14,740 --> 05:42:15,840
It's just a shotgun.

8545
05:42:18,160 --> 05:42:18,680
Oh.

8546
05:42:20,420 --> 05:42:21,020
Nice.

8547
05:42:21,800 --> 05:42:22,580
Reload time.

8548
05:42:22,960 --> 05:42:24,060
I'm reloading!

8549
05:42:25,680 --> 05:42:26,280
Alright.

8550
05:42:28,320 --> 05:42:28,920
What?!

8551
05:42:30,000 --> 05:42:30,600
Okay.

8552
05:42:30,680 --> 05:42:31,580
That is bullshit!

8553
05:42:34,260 --> 05:42:35,820
How the fuck do I shoot that?

8554
05:42:36,480 --> 05:42:37,080
Okay.

8555
05:42:37,880 --> 05:42:38,480
Bro!

8556
05:42:42,460 --> 05:42:43,060
Bro.

8557
05:42:43,240 --> 05:42:43,680
Okay.

8558
05:42:45,540 --> 05:42:46,720
There was no way.

8559
05:42:46,720 --> 05:42:49,260
There was no way to dodge that.

8560
05:42:49,420 --> 05:42:53,360
There was no way to dodge that.

8561
05:42:54,300 --> 05:42:56,000
There was no way to dodge that.

8562
05:42:56,000 --> 05:42:56,840
There was no way to dodge that.

8563
05:42:56,840 --> 05:42:57,540
The spread!

8564
05:42:58,880 --> 05:42:59,480
Guys!

8565
05:42:59,660 --> 05:43:01,140
The spread, man!

8566
05:43:01,240 --> 05:43:02,220
It's the spread!

8567
05:43:03,260 --> 05:43:05,160
Chat, it was the fucking spread!

8568
05:43:05,900 --> 05:43:07,320
Chat, it was the fucking spread!

8569
05:43:07,320 --> 05:43:07,780
Alright.

8570
05:43:10,260 --> 05:43:11,160
What do I get?

8571
05:43:13,040 --> 05:43:13,860
Hash bolt.

8572
05:43:14,000 --> 05:43:14,960
God damn it.

8573
05:43:14,980 --> 05:43:15,520
That's useless.

8574
05:43:16,980 --> 05:43:18,820
That's fucking useless for me.

8575
05:43:18,920 --> 05:43:19,140
Okay.

8576
05:43:19,180 --> 05:43:20,040
We need one more.

8577
05:43:20,900 --> 05:43:21,340
Alright.

8578
05:43:22,520 --> 05:43:24,260
Why is there a single fire in this?

8579
05:43:24,660 --> 05:43:25,080
High score.

8580
05:43:25,280 --> 05:43:25,700
Here we go!

8581
05:43:27,600 --> 05:43:29,540
I hate Ashley back-seeding me.

8582
05:43:32,880 --> 05:43:33,320
Alright.

8583
05:43:33,320 --> 05:43:33,860
Come on.

8584
05:43:34,060 --> 05:43:34,740
Oh shit.

8585
05:43:36,540 --> 05:43:36,980
Boom!

8586
05:43:36,980 --> 05:43:37,420
Boom!

8587
05:43:38,060 --> 05:43:38,500
Okay.

8588
05:43:39,060 --> 05:43:39,500
Nope.

8589
05:43:40,120 --> 05:43:40,900
We don't shoot.

8590
05:43:41,580 --> 05:43:42,020
Guys.

8591
05:43:43,180 --> 05:43:43,800
Reload time.

8592
05:43:44,320 --> 05:43:44,900
Come on.

8593
05:43:44,980 --> 05:43:45,420
Reload.

8594
05:43:45,420 --> 05:43:45,800
Reload.

8595
05:43:45,840 --> 05:43:46,380
It's time to reload!

8596
05:43:47,080 --> 05:43:48,220
We need the spread!

8597
05:43:50,420 --> 05:43:51,220
I'm ready.

8598
05:43:53,980 --> 05:43:55,880
Thank god I never got the PMP.

8599
05:43:56,000 --> 05:43:56,940
PMP plus sucks.

8600
05:43:57,580 --> 05:43:58,540
Oh fuck!

8601
05:44:00,840 --> 05:44:01,780
I'm sorry!

8602
05:44:02,240 --> 05:44:04,060
I got too trigger happy!

8603
05:44:07,000 --> 05:44:08,160
I'm sorry!

8604
05:44:08,820 --> 05:44:08,840
I'm sorry!

8605
05:44:10,100 --> 05:44:10,720
I'm sorry!

8606
05:44:10,720 --> 05:44:10,860
I'm sorry!

8607
05:44:10,860 --> 05:44:10,860
Okay.

8608
05:44:11,020 --> 05:44:14,640
It's like who innocent people over like 300 people I killed.

8609
05:44:14,740 --> 05:44:14,860
Okay.

8610
05:44:14,860 --> 05:44:14,860
It's like who innocent people over like 300 people I killed.

8611
05:44:14,860 --> 05:44:23,020
If I only accidentally killed one of them, after like saving the world, like I should get a pass.

8612
05:44:23,400 --> 05:44:24,960
I should get a pass there.

8613
05:44:28,740 --> 05:44:33,820
Like if I save the world and I only kill two people, like that's a win.

8614
05:44:35,900 --> 05:44:36,420
Okay.

8615
05:44:36,500 --> 05:44:39,200
Plus 15% ammo, craft bonus, frequent.

8616
05:44:39,340 --> 05:44:40,680
I don't fucking know what that is but...

8617
05:44:41,300 --> 05:44:43,140
That's literally all I have right now.

8618
05:44:44,640 --> 05:44:46,680
It's not a war criminal if I save it.

8619
05:44:46,680 --> 05:44:47,280
I saved the world!

8620
05:44:47,820 --> 05:44:55,240
If I saved like 300 people and only two people died, it's like just unlucky.

8621
05:44:55,780 --> 05:44:55,800
It's like just unlucky.

8622
05:44:55,800 --> 05:44:56,000
It's like just unlucky.

8623
05:44:56,500 --> 05:44:56,980
Okay.

8624
05:44:57,180 --> 05:44:57,700
Let's see.

8625
05:44:57,860 --> 05:44:59,080
Where is my...

8626
05:45:00,180 --> 05:45:02,220
How do I customize my case again?

8627
05:45:02,440 --> 05:45:02,700
Okay.

8628
05:45:02,740 --> 05:45:03,940
I need to go to my typewriter.

8629
05:45:04,360 --> 05:45:05,200
There we go.

8630
05:45:07,300 --> 05:45:07,780
Blues...

8631
05:45:08,420 --> 05:45:09,740
40% off resources.

8632
05:45:10,300 --> 05:45:10,460
Wait.

8633
05:45:10,520 --> 05:45:11,400
I already have this.

8634
05:45:13,340 --> 05:45:14,480
Which one is the...

8635
05:45:14,480 --> 05:45:15,040
Oh there you go.

8636
05:45:16,680 --> 05:45:19,760
I can only put three at once.

8637
05:45:20,280 --> 05:45:20,480
I can only put three at once.

8638
05:45:21,000 --> 05:45:21,940
Magma bonus.

8639
05:45:22,580 --> 05:45:22,760
Okay.

8640
05:45:22,780 --> 05:45:25,260
I feel like I'm not gonna craft the other stuff.

8641
05:45:26,960 --> 05:45:28,000
Magma bonus.

8642
05:45:28,340 --> 05:45:28,860
Okay.

8643
05:45:28,860 --> 05:45:28,860
I feel like I'm not gonna craft the other stuff.

8644
05:45:28,860 --> 05:45:29,120
Alright.

8645
05:45:29,260 --> 05:45:29,600
Nice.

8646
05:45:31,160 --> 05:45:31,680
Okay.

8647
05:45:33,300 --> 05:45:34,820
We gotta go...

8648
05:45:34,820 --> 05:45:36,100
Jesus Christ.

8649
05:45:36,320 --> 05:45:38,300
Why is there so many fucking names here?

8650
05:45:39,380 --> 05:45:40,440
I don't have anything.

8651
05:45:43,340 --> 05:45:44,340
Where do I go?

8652
05:45:45,580 --> 05:45:46,100
Here?

8653
05:45:47,800 --> 05:45:48,400
Okay.

8654
05:45:50,040 --> 05:45:51,060
Objective is here.

8655
05:45:51,360 --> 05:45:51,960
Okay.

8656
05:45:52,900 --> 05:45:52,900
Objective is here.

8657
05:45:52,900 --> 05:45:54,280
Can I go here?

8658
05:45:54,840 --> 05:45:55,040
Can I go here?

8659
05:45:55,840 --> 05:45:56,440
Like...

8660
05:45:56,440 --> 05:45:57,920
Is there any reason to be here?

8661
05:46:00,120 --> 05:46:02,760
Is there any reason to be here guys?

8662
05:46:02,920 --> 05:46:04,140
Is there any reason to be here guys?

8663
05:46:07,760 --> 05:46:09,120
I don't know.

8664
05:46:11,180 --> 05:46:12,360
Should I be here?

8665
05:46:13,700 --> 05:46:14,840
I can't tell.

8666
05:46:15,060 --> 05:46:15,380
I can't tell.

8667
05:46:18,540 --> 05:46:20,800
Oh it goes back to an earlier area?

8668
05:46:21,120 --> 05:46:22,260
Oh it goes back to an earlier area?

8669
05:46:23,760 --> 05:46:24,800
Fast travel.

8670
05:46:24,900 --> 05:46:25,900
I love fast travel.

8671
05:46:32,300 --> 05:46:34,100
Where is this place?

8672
05:46:37,640 --> 05:46:38,580
Where am I?

8673
05:46:39,180 --> 05:46:39,740
Oh!

8674
05:46:41,320 --> 05:46:43,080
Oh I remember this place.

8675
05:46:43,260 --> 05:46:43,760
I remember.

8676
05:46:45,260 --> 05:46:48,540
It's the... It's the part where I was trying to find the fucking bell.

8677
05:46:50,780 --> 05:46:51,920
It's the... It's the part where I was trying to find the fucking bell.

8678
05:46:53,080 --> 05:46:54,480
Yeah but I don't have any keys.

8679
05:46:55,100 --> 05:46:55,580
See?

8680
05:46:55,760 --> 05:46:57,140
I couldn't find any keys.

8681
05:46:57,640 --> 05:46:59,240
Cause like there's nothing to unlock.

8682
05:46:59,840 --> 05:47:01,080
Cause I don't have a key.

8683
05:47:01,760 --> 05:47:03,720
We'll come back later when we find a key.

8684
05:47:04,140 --> 05:47:04,760
This way.

8685
05:47:05,600 --> 05:47:07,200
Yeah but we don't have keys.

8686
05:47:13,440 --> 05:47:13,920
Yeah.

8687
05:47:14,640 --> 05:47:15,760
Hey this is it.

8688
05:47:17,180 --> 05:47:18,020
Red guy?

8689
05:47:18,360 --> 05:47:19,660
Who the fuck is red guy?

8690
05:47:22,920 --> 05:47:24,280
She does not come back.

8691
05:47:24,760 --> 05:47:25,340
She does not come back.

8692
05:47:26,680 --> 05:47:28,460
It was from this moment on.

8693
05:47:28,560 --> 05:47:29,220
Chad knew.

8694
05:47:29,400 --> 05:47:30,980
She did not come back.

8695
05:47:35,420 --> 05:47:36,420
Don't worry guys.

8696
05:47:36,540 --> 05:47:38,100
I'm gonna come back everybody.

8697
05:47:38,660 --> 05:47:39,640
Don't worry.

8698
05:47:40,100 --> 05:47:42,520
We're gonna come back.

8699
05:47:50,960 --> 05:47:51,760
Let's see.

8700
05:47:52,780 --> 05:47:53,600
This way.

8701
05:47:54,040 --> 05:47:55,240
Is there anything here?

8702
05:47:56,780 --> 05:47:57,720
No it's locked.

8703
05:47:58,300 --> 05:47:59,140
It's locked.

8704
05:48:03,900 --> 05:48:04,360
Where?

8705
05:48:05,740 --> 05:48:06,360
Oh hey.

8706
05:48:06,440 --> 05:48:07,140
Can I shoot that?

8707
05:48:07,980 --> 05:48:08,440
Actually.

8708
05:48:08,820 --> 05:48:10,020
Why would I shoot that?

8709
05:48:10,080 --> 05:48:10,720
I could knife it.

8710
05:48:17,460 --> 05:48:18,140
Let's see.

8711
05:48:18,300 --> 05:48:21,060
Oh I forgot to shoot the medallions.

8712
05:48:21,180 --> 05:48:22,640
I almost forgot about the medallions.

8713
05:48:23,380 --> 05:48:25,740
There's a medallion above me?

8714
05:48:26,080 --> 05:48:26,860
Question mark?

8715
05:48:29,980 --> 05:48:30,440
Medallion?

8716
05:48:33,060 --> 05:48:33,520
Medallion?

8717
05:48:35,080 --> 05:48:39,420
What the fuck is...

8718
05:48:39,420 --> 05:48:40,260
Is it below me?

8719
05:48:42,040 --> 05:48:43,960
Maybe I'm gonna shoot this one first though.

8720
05:48:45,800 --> 05:48:47,280
I'm gonna shoot that one first.

8721
05:48:47,600 --> 05:48:49,060
Since it's over there anyway.

8722
05:48:50,520 --> 05:48:51,080
Okay.

8723
05:48:53,840 --> 05:48:55,420
We're gonna go this way.

8724
05:48:57,780 --> 05:48:58,340
Oh.

8725
05:48:58,340 --> 05:48:59,080
What's this?

8726
05:49:01,960 --> 05:49:04,040
Okay we need the Cerberus head.

8727
05:49:05,580 --> 05:49:06,860
Oh what the fuck?

8728
05:49:07,700 --> 05:49:08,220
Oh it's like here.

8729
05:49:09,520 --> 05:49:10,800
I was like where is that?

8730
05:49:11,640 --> 05:49:13,720
Rats have infested a section of the castle.

8731
05:49:13,840 --> 05:49:15,820
They are gnawing away at all the precious books.

8732
05:49:16,040 --> 05:49:18,020
But those heretics couldn't care less.

8733
05:49:18,380 --> 05:49:20,460
Okay it's time to shoot the rats as well.

8734
05:49:21,460 --> 05:49:24,040
There's so many things to shoot.

8735
05:49:25,540 --> 05:49:26,820
So little time.

8736
05:49:28,260 --> 05:49:29,900
There's only one Leon.

8737
05:49:34,180 --> 05:49:37,840
I assume this is the library.

8738
05:49:40,760 --> 05:49:42,380
There's only one Leon.

8739
05:49:42,500 --> 05:49:42,760
There's only one Leon.

8740
05:49:43,980 --> 05:49:46,510
There's only one Leon.

8741
05:49:46,730 --> 05:49:47,590
Oh my god.

8742
05:49:47,630 --> 05:49:48,290
Where do I go?

8743
05:49:48,530 --> 05:49:49,830
What the fuck is this?

8744
05:49:50,670 --> 05:49:51,570
Guys there's...

8745
05:49:51,570 --> 05:49:52,770
Okay I don't know where to go.

8746
05:49:52,830 --> 05:49:53,990
There's way too many entrances.

8747
05:49:54,150 --> 05:49:58,210
There's way too many things in here.

8748
05:49:59,370 --> 05:50:00,790
There's a symbol on the wall.

8749
05:50:05,110 --> 05:50:05,630
Okay.

8750
05:50:06,530 --> 05:50:08,390
I have to do all the rooms?

8751
05:50:09,910 --> 05:50:10,790
I do?

8752
05:50:11,910 --> 05:50:12,510
Alright.

8753
05:50:12,970 --> 05:50:14,690
Let me figure this shit out.

8754
05:50:15,050 --> 05:50:16,570
Okay we'll go this door first.

8755
05:50:19,530 --> 05:50:21,710
This is gonna be a long chapter.

8756
05:50:21,930 --> 05:50:22,890
I can tell.

8757
05:50:23,390 --> 05:50:25,730
No it's the snake room!

8758
05:50:26,990 --> 05:50:27,590
No!

8759
05:50:27,910 --> 05:50:29,270
Okay let me...

8760
05:50:29,270 --> 05:50:30,110
I'm saving.

8761
05:50:36,580 --> 05:50:37,480
I'm saving.

8762
05:50:39,440 --> 05:50:40,640
I'm getting...

8763
05:50:41,500 --> 05:50:42,240
I'm getting...

8764
05:50:42,260 --> 05:50:43,960
I'm getting snake PTSD.

8765
05:50:50,160 --> 05:50:52,240
I'm getting snake PTSD.

8766
05:50:52,820 --> 05:50:56,220
I'm getting snake PTSD right now.

8767
05:50:56,560 --> 05:50:57,100
I'm getting snake PTSD right now.

8768
05:50:57,100 --> 05:50:57,120
Okay.

8769
05:50:57,300 --> 05:51:03,760
Okay let's see.

8770
05:51:05,860 --> 05:51:06,820
Alright.

8771
05:51:08,420 --> 05:51:09,560
Dining hall?

8772
05:51:09,860 --> 05:51:11,000
It's puzzle time.

8773
05:51:12,260 --> 05:51:12,720
No thanks.

8774
05:51:14,080 --> 05:51:14,900
Where's the rat?

8775
05:51:15,140 --> 05:51:15,920
There was a rat?

8776
05:51:17,540 --> 05:51:18,020
Rat!

8777
05:51:18,640 --> 05:51:19,360
Here we go.

8778
05:51:19,700 --> 05:51:20,640
We got the rat.

8779
05:51:22,020 --> 05:51:23,160
Pest control is here.

8780
05:51:23,500 --> 05:51:23,980
Wait what?

8781
05:51:24,160 --> 05:51:24,600
Order?

8782
05:51:26,560 --> 05:51:27,520
Sit there?

8783
05:51:29,940 --> 05:51:32,780
Oh I can like have her sit there while I do this puzzle.

8784
05:51:33,000 --> 05:51:34,320
That is so nice of her.

8785
05:51:36,500 --> 05:51:36,980
Okay.

8786
05:51:40,220 --> 05:51:40,700
Okay.

8787
05:51:40,780 --> 05:51:41,160
Oh!

8788
05:51:41,300 --> 05:51:41,640
Oh!

8789
05:51:41,680 --> 05:51:42,040
Okay!

8790
05:51:42,260 --> 05:51:43,140
I got this.

8791
05:51:43,460 --> 05:51:45,660
Alright I need you to sit...

8792
05:51:46,130 --> 05:51:46,440
Okay.

8793
05:51:47,960 --> 05:51:49,880
Napkin, two... two...

8794
05:51:49,880 --> 05:51:53,040
Two knives, Spoon fork.

8795
05:51:53,520 --> 05:51:55,940
Napkin, two knives, spoon fork.

8796
05:51:57,100 --> 05:51:58,160
Napkin, two...

8797
05:51:58,160 --> 05:51:58,680
That's three.

8798
05:51:59,520 --> 05:52:01,540
Two knives... wait is there bread?

8799
05:52:03,780 --> 05:52:04,400
No.

8800
05:52:04,500 --> 05:52:04,880
No bread.

8801
05:52:07,100 --> 05:52:09,880
Napkin, two knives, Spoon fork.

8802
05:52:09,880 --> 05:52:10,120
Spoon fork.

8803
05:52:12,120 --> 05:52:12,840
Go here.

8804
05:52:13,000 --> 05:52:13,520
Sit here.

8805
05:52:20,280 --> 05:52:21,340
Okay my turn.

8806
05:52:22,920 --> 05:52:23,600
Let's see.

8807
05:52:25,480 --> 05:52:25,960
Okay.

8808
05:52:26,940 --> 05:52:27,900
Three knives.

8809
05:52:28,800 --> 05:52:30,420
Two forks, one spoon.

8810
05:52:30,460 --> 05:52:32,420
Three knives, two forks, one spoon.

8811
05:52:32,560 --> 05:52:34,000
Three knives, two forks, one spoon.

8812
05:52:34,080 --> 05:52:34,520
Oh I'm here.

8813
05:52:34,700 --> 05:52:35,440
I sit here.

8814
05:52:35,880 --> 05:52:36,800
This is my spot.

8815
05:52:40,390 --> 05:52:41,210
I did it!

8816
05:52:42,190 --> 05:52:42,670
Yeah!

8817
05:52:44,430 --> 05:52:45,410
We're so smart.

8818
05:52:45,810 --> 05:52:46,110
Looks like you figured it out.

8819
05:52:46,330 --> 05:52:48,250
Oh this isn't the bad snake room.

8820
05:52:48,430 --> 05:52:51,610
I thought this was the one where the fucking guy with the...

8821
05:52:51,610 --> 05:52:53,170
With the knives thing.

8822
05:52:53,390 --> 05:52:54,870
You know like the knife arms.

8823
05:52:54,990 --> 05:52:56,430
And then he slashes me.

8824
05:52:56,510 --> 05:52:57,730
I thought it was this room.

8825
05:52:58,470 --> 05:53:00,770
It's not this room so it's the other rooms.

8826
05:53:02,710 --> 05:53:06,670
If it's not this room, it's gonna be the other rooms.

8827
05:53:10,110 --> 05:53:10,830
It's gonna be the other rooms.

8828
05:53:10,830 --> 05:53:12,330
Yeah the cage fight.

8829
05:53:12,610 --> 05:53:14,730
I thought it was the cage fight.

8830
05:53:14,850 --> 05:53:15,730
Oh there's the red herb.

8831
05:53:17,170 --> 05:53:17,730
Yeah.

8832
05:53:19,050 --> 05:53:19,830
Don't worry.

8833
05:53:19,890 --> 05:53:21,690
We'll eventually get to that room.

8834
05:53:21,890 --> 05:53:22,670
I can feel it.

8835
05:53:23,750 --> 05:53:24,670
Check the map.

8836
05:53:24,870 --> 05:53:25,530
A Dallion!

8837
05:53:27,770 --> 05:53:28,330
Dallion?

8838
05:53:28,710 --> 05:53:29,810
Oh there it is.

8839
05:53:32,550 --> 05:53:33,110
Nice.

8840
05:53:33,310 --> 05:53:34,190
Thanks for the reminder.

8841
05:53:35,070 --> 05:53:36,350
Okay and then...

8842
05:53:36,350 --> 05:53:37,630
We gotta go here.

8843
05:53:38,570 --> 05:53:39,050
And...

8844
05:53:39,930 --> 05:53:41,350
Okay we gotta go like this.

8845
05:53:41,530 --> 05:53:42,010
Apparently.

8846
05:53:45,210 --> 05:53:46,070
Almost got it.

8847
05:53:46,210 --> 05:53:46,610
Alright.

8848
05:53:46,750 --> 05:53:47,410
Here we go.

8849
05:53:51,120 --> 05:53:52,560
Who has the snake head?

8850
05:53:52,680 --> 05:53:54,280
We might as well give him the snake head now.

8851
05:53:54,780 --> 05:53:56,560
I still left this guy.

8852
05:53:58,120 --> 05:54:00,500
Oh I don't even have to do the puzzle for this.

8853
05:54:00,600 --> 05:54:02,260
Thank god.

8854
05:54:03,840 --> 05:54:04,940
Thank god it's automatic.

8855
05:54:09,440 --> 05:54:10,040
Alright.

8856
05:54:10,040 --> 05:54:10,980
Here we go.

8857
05:54:11,900 --> 05:54:13,000
Is this combat?

8858
05:54:13,160 --> 05:54:14,940
This has to be combat oriented.

8859
05:54:16,160 --> 05:54:17,140
There's no way.

8860
05:54:17,420 --> 05:54:18,180
Leon there's some armor.

8861
05:54:18,820 --> 05:54:20,500
Bet you could use it like a bullet proof vest.

8862
05:54:21,540 --> 05:54:23,660
Little old fashioned for my taste.

8863
05:54:25,000 --> 05:54:25,600
Ooo.

8864
05:54:25,600 --> 05:54:26,880
Oh I can feel it.

8865
05:54:26,940 --> 05:54:28,260
I feel the...

8866
05:54:28,260 --> 05:54:29,920
I feel the gun fight.

8867
05:54:30,820 --> 05:54:31,800
Too bad.

8868
05:54:35,840 --> 05:54:37,140
Oh there you go.

8869
05:54:37,740 --> 05:54:38,640
Don't worry about shotgun.

8870
05:54:41,220 --> 05:54:42,800
I have my shotgun.

8871
05:54:43,060 --> 05:54:44,640
I have my shotgun.

8872
05:54:47,960 --> 05:54:48,700
Don't worry.

8873
05:54:49,120 --> 05:54:50,200
Don't worry.

8874
05:54:50,200 --> 05:54:50,260
Don't worry.

8875
05:54:53,130 --> 05:54:54,430
Alright here we go.

8876
05:54:56,210 --> 05:54:56,770
Oh.

8877
05:54:56,910 --> 05:54:57,730
Here we go.

8878
05:54:58,110 --> 05:54:58,490
Woah.

8879
05:54:58,810 --> 05:54:59,370
Wow.

8880
05:55:02,310 --> 05:55:04,130
Actually let's go save our game.

8881
05:55:04,550 --> 05:55:05,110
Actually let's go save our game.

8882
05:55:05,110 --> 05:55:06,590
Before we go downstairs.

8883
05:55:06,810 --> 05:55:08,010
There's a base here anyway.

8884
05:55:08,270 --> 05:55:09,870
So it's good that I came back.

8885
05:55:10,870 --> 05:55:11,270
Alright Ashley.

8886
05:55:11,410 --> 05:55:13,010
We're gonna save the game.

8887
05:55:17,210 --> 05:55:18,250
Don't have much.

8888
05:55:18,310 --> 05:55:19,430
So let's save.

8889
05:55:23,070 --> 05:55:23,810
It's okay.

8890
05:55:24,170 --> 05:55:25,270
Everything is fine.

8891
05:55:26,650 --> 05:55:27,750
Everything is fine.

8892
05:55:29,430 --> 05:55:30,530
I could see...

8893
05:55:30,530 --> 05:55:32,170
The lion is like in the center.

8894
05:55:33,010 --> 05:55:34,930
That worries me a little bit.

8895
05:55:35,090 --> 05:55:37,730
It tells me that I have something to worry about.

8896
05:55:40,870 --> 05:55:41,810
Alright here we go.

8897
05:55:42,550 --> 05:55:44,330
Here we go.

8898
05:55:46,190 --> 05:55:47,110
Woo.

8899
05:55:49,780 --> 05:55:50,700
Alright.

8900
05:55:51,420 --> 05:55:52,880
It's time to fight.

8901
05:55:53,100 --> 05:55:53,920
I have my shotgun.

8902
05:55:56,040 --> 05:55:56,500
Mmm.

8903
05:55:57,360 --> 05:55:58,080
Mmm.

8904
05:55:58,740 --> 05:55:59,660
Mmm.

8905
05:56:00,100 --> 05:56:00,660
Mmm.

8906
05:56:02,060 --> 05:56:02,520
Mmm.

8907
05:56:03,140 --> 05:56:03,640
Mmm.

8908
05:56:06,640 --> 05:56:07,560
Ah.

8909
05:56:08,020 --> 05:56:08,520
Ah.

8910
05:56:10,700 --> 05:56:11,520
Mmm.

8911
05:56:12,680 --> 05:56:13,060
Hahaha.

8912
05:56:14,960 --> 05:56:15,960
Mmm.

8913
05:56:16,480 --> 05:56:17,420
Mmm.

8914
05:56:18,340 --> 05:56:19,340
Mmm.

8915
05:56:24,110 --> 05:56:24,610
Okay.

8916
05:56:25,610 --> 05:56:26,610
Wait.

8917
05:56:28,750 --> 05:56:29,170
What?

8918
05:56:30,030 --> 05:56:32,590
I wish I had the flash grenade now.

8919
05:56:33,490 --> 05:56:34,490
Okay.

8920
05:56:34,910 --> 05:56:35,730
Hehehe.

8921
05:56:35,910 --> 05:56:36,410
Woah.

8922
05:56:36,410 --> 05:56:36,510
Woah.

8923
05:56:42,260 --> 05:56:42,780
Oh.

8924
05:56:42,820 --> 05:56:43,220
It's a guy.

8925
05:56:47,920 --> 05:56:48,440
Wait.

8926
05:56:48,640 --> 05:56:49,080
I can...

8927
05:56:49,080 --> 05:56:49,540
Shake.

8928
05:56:49,640 --> 05:56:50,840
I forgot to shake.

8929
05:56:51,180 --> 05:56:51,900
I was like.

8930
05:56:52,040 --> 05:56:53,140
What is that?

8931
05:56:56,020 --> 05:56:56,540
Alright.

8932
05:56:56,540 --> 05:56:57,060
Nice.

8933
05:56:57,360 --> 05:56:57,880
Okay.

8934
05:56:57,940 --> 05:56:58,440
Shake time.

8935
05:56:58,540 --> 05:56:59,000
Shake time.

8936
05:56:59,200 --> 05:56:59,640
Shake!

8937
05:57:01,420 --> 05:57:02,060
What's this?

8938
05:57:03,780 --> 05:57:04,300
Wait.

8939
05:57:04,420 --> 05:57:04,720
Wait.

8940
05:57:04,760 --> 05:57:05,120
Wait.

8941
05:57:05,140 --> 05:57:05,500
Wait.

8942
05:57:05,500 --> 05:57:05,760
Wait.

8943
05:57:05,760 --> 05:57:05,940
Wait.

8944
05:57:05,940 --> 05:57:06,160
Wait.

8945
05:57:06,160 --> 05:57:06,340
Wait.

8946
05:57:06,340 --> 05:57:06,520
Wait.

8947
05:57:06,560 --> 05:57:06,600
Wait.

8948
05:57:09,540 --> 05:57:09,980
Wait.

8949
05:57:09,980 --> 05:57:10,420
Wait.

8950
05:57:10,420 --> 05:57:10,500
Wait.

8951
05:57:10,500 --> 05:57:10,500
Wait.

8952
05:57:10,500 --> 05:57:10,500
Wait.

8953
05:57:10,500 --> 05:57:10,500
Wait.

8954
05:57:10,500 --> 05:57:10,500
Wait.

8955
05:57:10,500 --> 05:57:10,500
Wait.

8956
05:57:10,520 --> 05:57:12,580
Wouldn't it be great if I had...

8957
05:57:12,580 --> 05:57:13,220
You know...

8958
05:57:14,040 --> 05:57:14,920
You know.

8959
05:57:15,000 --> 05:57:15,780
If I had...

8960
05:57:17,800 --> 05:57:18,240
Nice.

8961
05:57:18,280 --> 05:57:18,600
Nice.

8962
05:57:18,620 --> 05:57:19,180
That's good.

8963
05:57:19,200 --> 05:57:19,700
That's good.

8964
05:57:19,740 --> 05:57:20,260
That's good.

8965
05:57:20,540 --> 05:57:22,660
It would be so great if I had...

8966
05:57:23,100 --> 05:57:23,540
Fucking...

8967
05:57:24,800 --> 05:57:26,080
Have the flashbang.

8968
05:57:27,260 --> 05:57:27,700
Man.

8969
05:57:27,840 --> 05:57:29,200
That would be so convenient.

8970
05:57:29,840 --> 05:57:30,280
Okay.

8971
05:57:31,700 --> 05:57:32,720
I got this though.

8972
05:57:33,740 --> 05:57:34,400
It's okay.

8973
05:57:35,380 --> 05:57:36,060
It's okay.

8974
05:57:36,100 --> 05:57:36,580
I got this.

8975
05:57:39,840 --> 05:57:40,280
Nice.

8976
05:57:40,440 --> 05:57:40,720
Nice.

8977
05:57:41,940 --> 05:57:42,380
Oh.

8978
05:57:42,460 --> 05:57:43,440
It wasn't as bad as I thought.

8979
05:57:43,600 --> 05:57:44,020
Thank God.

8980
05:57:44,420 --> 05:57:45,120
Thank God.

8981
05:57:46,220 --> 05:57:47,640
It's not as bad as I thought.

8982
05:57:49,680 --> 05:57:50,120
Oh.

8983
05:57:50,160 --> 05:57:50,760
Thank God.

8984
05:57:52,940 --> 05:57:53,920
Is there more?

8985
05:57:54,300 --> 05:57:54,600
Is there more?

8986
05:57:55,460 --> 05:57:56,540
What the f...

8987
05:57:56,540 --> 05:57:57,100
Oh.

8988
05:57:57,120 --> 05:57:57,400
Oh.

8989
05:57:57,440 --> 05:57:57,740
Oh.

8990
05:57:57,740 --> 05:57:57,980
Oh.

8991
05:57:57,980 --> 05:57:58,140
Oh.

8992
05:57:58,840 --> 05:58:00,300
I didn't see these two.

8993
05:58:01,300 --> 05:58:01,740
Okay.

8994
05:58:03,380 --> 05:58:03,820
No.

8995
05:58:03,920 --> 05:58:04,140
No.

8996
05:58:04,160 --> 05:58:04,320
No.

8997
05:58:04,400 --> 05:58:04,840
Reload.

8998
05:58:04,840 --> 05:58:05,180
Reload.

8999
05:58:05,200 --> 05:58:05,540
Reload.

9000
05:58:07,300 --> 05:58:08,060
Okay.

9001
05:58:08,540 --> 05:58:10,520
Please throw the flame!

9002
05:58:12,140 --> 05:58:12,900
Ashley!

9003
05:58:13,060 --> 05:58:14,480
Throw the flame!

9004
05:58:14,660 --> 05:58:14,860
I'm

9005
05:58:18,920 --> 05:58:19,540
holding it!

9006
05:58:31,630 --> 05:58:32,390
Ashley!

9007
05:58:32,390 --> 05:58:34,750
How did you miss the flame?

9008
05:58:38,670 --> 05:58:39,430
Ashley!

9009
05:58:42,490 --> 05:58:42,510
How did you miss the flame?

9010
05:58:42,510 --> 05:58:44,170
I had to lead them, Ashley!

9011
05:58:44,170 --> 05:58:44,470
Ashley!

9012
05:58:47,830 --> 05:58:48,670
There you go.

9013
05:58:49,750 --> 05:58:51,450
Stop being useless.

9014
05:58:53,190 --> 05:58:54,010
Ashley, please.

9015
05:58:56,050 --> 05:58:56,950
Ashley, please.

9016
05:58:57,010 --> 05:58:57,190
Ashley, please.

9017
05:58:57,190 --> 05:58:57,990
How did you miss?

9018
05:58:58,830 --> 05:58:59,750
Oh God.

9019
05:58:59,870 --> 05:59:00,890
How did you miss?

9020
05:59:01,030 --> 05:59:02,110
Ashley, you have...

9021
05:59:02,110 --> 05:59:03,630
Did you run out?

9022
05:59:03,690 --> 05:59:05,050
Did you run out, Ashley?

9023
05:59:06,610 --> 05:59:07,090
Okay.

9024
05:59:09,230 --> 05:59:09,970
There you go.

9025
05:59:09,970 --> 05:59:11,690
Thank fucking God.

9026
05:59:11,730 --> 05:59:11,950
Kick!

9027
05:59:14,590 --> 05:59:15,230
Oh!

9028
05:59:15,630 --> 05:59:17,650
I didn't waste too much ammo at least.

9029
05:59:18,190 --> 05:59:19,390
Oh my...

9030
05:59:19,390 --> 05:59:21,890
The moment I said that...

9031
05:59:22,830 --> 05:59:24,110
The moment...

9032
05:59:24,110 --> 05:59:27,270
The moment I said that, I missed two shots.

9033
05:59:28,090 --> 05:59:29,410
What is my life?

9034
05:59:29,790 --> 05:59:30,230
Are you okay?

9035
05:59:31,610 --> 05:59:32,250
Yeah.

9036
05:59:33,670 --> 05:59:34,490
Nighty night.

9037
05:59:35,030 --> 05:59:35,670
Nights.

9038
05:59:37,250 --> 05:59:37,750
Okay.

9039
05:59:37,830 --> 05:59:39,310
We won't pick her up yet.

9040
05:59:39,510 --> 05:59:40,570
Okay, now we can.

9041
05:59:41,150 --> 05:59:42,450
I have to get the loot.

9042
05:59:43,530 --> 05:59:44,530
Classic Ducky.

9043
05:59:48,030 --> 05:59:49,190
Yeah, I'm okay.

9044
05:59:49,990 --> 05:59:50,730
Don't worry.

9045
05:59:50,810 --> 05:59:51,730
With your aim...

9046
05:59:51,730 --> 05:59:52,410
Don't worry.

9047
05:59:52,650 --> 05:59:54,170
I definitely did not get burned.

9048
05:59:58,240 --> 05:59:59,300
Oh my God.

9049
05:59:59,360 --> 06:00:00,080
Give me the loot.

9050
06:00:00,580 --> 06:00:02,080
Give me the fucking loot.

9051
06:00:03,840 --> 06:00:04,640
Okay, nice.

9052
06:00:04,980 --> 06:00:05,600
Oh hey.

9053
06:00:10,540 --> 06:00:12,320
Hey guys, I found the flash grenade.

9054
06:00:13,380 --> 06:00:14,680
Hey guys, I found the flash grenade.

9055
06:00:14,680 --> 06:00:14,920
Guys, don't worry.

9056
06:00:15,080 --> 06:00:16,440
Flash grenade next fight.

9057
06:00:16,900 --> 06:00:18,000
Chat, the flash...

9058
06:00:18,000 --> 06:00:20,660
We can have the flash grenade next fight.

9059
06:00:20,760 --> 06:00:21,580
Chat, don't worry.

9060
06:00:22,440 --> 06:00:23,440
Just in time.

9061
06:00:26,200 --> 06:00:27,360
Okay, let's see.

9062
06:00:27,440 --> 06:00:28,280
We gotta open this.

9063
06:00:29,320 --> 06:00:29,800
Okay.

9064
06:00:34,170 --> 06:00:35,150
Alright, here we go.

9065
06:00:40,980 --> 06:00:43,220
Isn't that so nice that I found it?

9066
06:00:44,220 --> 06:00:45,340
Isn't that so nice that I found it?

9067
06:00:45,340 --> 06:00:48,160
Guys, I found it just in time.

9068
06:00:48,180 --> 06:00:48,780
Oh nice.

9069
06:00:48,880 --> 06:00:50,540
I knew there was a medallion here.

9070
06:00:51,060 --> 06:00:52,480
I felt it in my soul.

9071
06:00:53,540 --> 06:00:54,600
Not from the map.

9072
06:00:54,800 --> 06:00:55,700
It was from the soul.

9073
06:00:57,540 --> 06:00:59,140
I don't think they're gonna move, do you?

9074
06:00:59,620 --> 06:01:01,040
Oh, I caught the cube.

9075
06:01:02,120 --> 06:01:02,940
Wait, the cube.

9076
06:01:04,140 --> 06:01:04,540
Right.

9077
06:01:05,740 --> 06:01:06,140
Nice.

9078
06:01:06,340 --> 06:01:06,900
Nice flick.

9079
06:01:08,460 --> 06:01:09,340
That was a good flick.

9080
06:01:09,380 --> 06:01:09,860
Not gonna lie.

9081
06:01:13,260 --> 06:01:13,660
Alright.

9082
06:01:14,300 --> 06:01:14,980
Right here.

9083
06:01:19,580 --> 06:01:20,140
Alright.

9084
06:01:20,200 --> 06:01:20,620
Alright.

9085
06:01:20,620 --> 06:01:20,720
Alright.

9086
06:01:20,720 --> 06:01:21,880
Wait, not save yet.

9087
06:01:21,980 --> 06:01:23,040
We gotta get the cube.

9088
06:01:24,220 --> 06:01:24,980
Cube time.

9089
06:01:29,030 --> 06:01:29,730
Oh, okay.

9090
06:01:29,830 --> 06:01:30,330
It's a puzzle.

9091
06:01:31,530 --> 06:01:32,210
Okay, no.

9092
06:01:32,270 --> 06:01:32,790
That's a circle.

9093
06:01:33,650 --> 06:01:34,550
Where's the square?

9094
06:01:37,270 --> 06:01:37,550
Uh...

9095
06:01:38,290 --> 06:01:38,850
Uh...

9096
06:01:38,850 --> 06:01:39,910
How do I...

9097
06:01:39,910 --> 06:01:41,450
Oh, here!

9098
06:01:41,790 --> 06:01:42,350
Nice.

9099
06:01:43,630 --> 06:01:44,530
So smart.

9100
06:01:45,810 --> 06:01:46,830
We did it!

9101
06:01:48,610 --> 06:01:51,270
The square goes in the square hole.

9102
06:01:51,650 --> 06:01:53,530
The square goes in the square hole.

9103
06:01:53,530 --> 06:01:53,890
Okay.

9104
06:01:54,070 --> 06:01:55,130
We need the...

9105
06:01:55,130 --> 06:01:56,770
What other opens the cube?

9106
06:01:58,490 --> 06:02:01,710
I think there's a cube in one of these, right?

9107
06:02:02,050 --> 06:02:02,250
I think there's a cube in one of these, right?

9108
06:02:02,250 --> 06:02:02,550
I think there's a cube in one of these, right?

9109
06:02:05,060 --> 06:02:07,920
Was there a cube treasure here?

9110
06:02:08,240 --> 06:02:08,300
Was there a cube treasure here?

9111
06:02:08,300 --> 06:02:08,580
Yeah?

9112
06:02:08,780 --> 06:02:09,660
Alright, we go back.

9113
06:02:09,760 --> 06:02:10,880
It's fast travel time.

9114
06:02:13,000 --> 06:02:13,880
Fast travel!

9115
06:02:14,360 --> 06:02:15,700
Come over, Ashley.

9116
06:02:15,700 --> 06:02:15,900
Ashley.

9117
06:02:17,200 --> 06:02:18,020
We're cubing.

9118
06:02:23,240 --> 06:02:24,300
I know my shapes.

9119
06:02:24,540 --> 06:02:25,220
Hey, this is it!

9120
06:02:27,480 --> 06:02:28,800
I know my shapes!

9121
06:02:30,500 --> 06:02:31,380
I know my shapes!

9122
06:02:31,380 --> 06:02:32,000
Okay, this way.

9123
06:02:32,320 --> 06:02:34,180
Okay, this way.

9124
06:02:35,400 --> 06:02:35,840
Woop!

9125
06:02:39,640 --> 06:02:40,600
It's money time.

9126
06:02:40,840 --> 06:02:41,960
Guys, we need to upgrade.

9127
06:02:43,900 --> 06:02:45,000
We need to upgrade.

9128
06:02:45,080 --> 06:02:45,820
It's money time.

9129
06:02:46,280 --> 06:02:47,540
Oh, it leads back here.

9130
06:02:48,020 --> 06:02:50,780
Oh, it leads back here.

9131
06:02:50,780 --> 06:02:51,260
What the...

9132
06:02:52,820 --> 06:02:54,340
What the...

9133
06:02:57,560 --> 06:02:58,820
Okay.

9134
06:03:05,800 --> 06:03:06,800
Okay.

9135
06:03:08,680 --> 06:03:09,940
Hello?

9136
06:03:10,560 --> 06:03:11,820
Hello?

9137
06:03:11,820 --> 06:03:12,300
What the...

9138
06:03:12,300 --> 06:03:13,080
Okay.

9139
06:03:19,670 --> 06:03:20,640
What the...

9140
06:03:20,640 --> 06:03:22,840
Ashley, get back!

9141
06:03:26,270 --> 06:03:28,690
Okay, here we go.

9142
06:03:28,890 --> 06:03:28,970
Okay, here we go.

9143
06:03:28,970 --> 06:03:30,150
Ashley!

9144
06:03:30,690 --> 06:03:31,630
Come move!

9145
06:03:33,350 --> 06:03:35,710
Ashley, what are you doing?

9146
06:03:36,250 --> 06:03:37,290
Ashley, what are you doing?

9147
06:03:37,810 --> 06:03:39,670
Oh my god!

9148
06:03:39,730 --> 06:03:40,150
Oh my god!

9149
06:03:40,150 --> 06:03:41,430
I swear to god, Ashley.

9150
06:03:41,570 --> 06:03:43,590
I swear to fucking god.

9151
06:03:43,910 --> 06:03:47,370
Ashley, I swear to god.

9152
06:03:47,430 --> 06:03:47,490
I swear to god.

9153
06:03:47,490 --> 06:03:48,010
I have to reload.

9154
06:03:49,010 --> 06:03:50,250
My god.

9155
06:03:52,890 --> 06:03:55,130
Ashley, what are you doing?

9156
06:03:55,790 --> 06:03:55,810
Ashley, what are you doing?

9157
06:03:55,810 --> 06:03:56,270
No problem.

9158
06:03:56,270 --> 06:03:56,850
Oh my god.

9159
06:03:57,150 --> 06:03:59,470
You hurt?

9160
06:03:59,890 --> 06:04:00,890
I'm good, thanks.

9161
06:04:01,190 --> 06:04:04,470
Oh my god, what the fuck is Ashley doing?

9162
06:04:09,280 --> 06:04:10,100
Oh my god, what the fuck is Ashley doing?

9163
06:04:10,100 --> 06:04:10,640
Jesus Christ.

9164
06:04:10,740 --> 06:04:11,820
I swear.

9165
06:04:12,700 --> 06:04:16,640
I swear to god, Ashley.

9166
06:04:17,340 --> 06:04:17,660
I swear to god, Ashley.

9167
06:04:17,660 --> 06:04:18,440
I swear to god, Ashley.

9168
06:04:18,440 --> 06:04:19,080
Jesus.

9169
06:04:23,220 --> 06:04:26,280
She's just trying to help, donkey.

9170
06:04:28,920 --> 06:04:29,680
She's just trying to help, donkey.

9171
06:04:29,680 --> 06:04:31,380
She was so helpful, chat.

9172
06:04:32,720 --> 06:04:33,880
She was so helpful, chat.

9173
06:04:33,880 --> 06:04:35,960
She really was incredibly helpful.

9174
06:04:36,740 --> 06:04:39,120
Okay, time to do the cube.

9175
06:04:40,340 --> 06:04:42,020
It's cubing time.

9176
06:04:45,730 --> 06:04:47,010
God damn it.

9177
06:04:47,110 --> 06:04:49,150
Okay, it's this way.

9178
06:04:49,530 --> 06:04:49,650
Okay, it's this way.

9179
06:04:51,830 --> 06:04:54,390
I'm trying to find the circular one.

9180
06:04:58,620 --> 06:04:59,640
Oh my god.

9181
06:04:59,680 --> 06:04:59,880
Where?

9182
06:05:00,080 --> 06:05:00,760
Where is it?

9183
06:05:01,260 --> 06:05:02,580
Okay, maybe it's here?

9184
06:05:04,720 --> 06:05:05,280
No.

9185
06:05:05,760 --> 06:05:06,980
Okay, this is difficult.

9186
06:05:09,140 --> 06:05:09,700
Cat.

9187
06:05:09,700 --> 06:05:10,260
Cat.

9188
06:05:11,000 --> 06:05:12,660
Too stupid for this.

9189
06:05:17,140 --> 06:05:17,700
Okay.

9190
06:05:17,700 --> 06:05:18,640
Oh my god.

9191
06:05:18,780 --> 06:05:20,740
There's Q and E.

9192
06:05:21,060 --> 06:05:22,380
There's Q and E!

9193
06:05:22,640 --> 06:05:23,940
I didn't realize!

9194
06:05:24,280 --> 06:05:26,840
I didn't realize there was Q and E!

9195
06:05:26,860 --> 06:05:27,240
I didn't realize there was Q and E!

9196
06:05:31,180 --> 06:05:33,120
I didn't realize there was Q and E!

9197
06:05:33,120 --> 06:05:33,260
I didn't realize there was Q and E!

9198
06:05:33,260 --> 06:05:33,980
I didn't realize there was another rotation!

9199
06:05:35,480 --> 06:05:36,860
Okay, I figured it out.

9200
06:05:38,140 --> 06:05:39,320
I wasn't reading.

9201
06:05:39,580 --> 06:05:41,140
I was just pressing buttons.

9202
06:05:41,560 --> 06:05:43,740
I was just pressing buttons.

9203
06:05:43,740 --> 06:05:45,600
Oh my god.

9204
06:05:45,640 --> 06:05:46,880
Okay, let me sell this.

9205
06:05:47,500 --> 06:05:48,660
Let me sell this.

9206
06:05:51,020 --> 06:05:51,540
Okay.

9207
06:05:52,480 --> 06:05:53,280
Let's see.

9208
06:05:53,540 --> 06:05:56,400
We don't have... Wait, is this circular?

9209
06:05:56,860 --> 06:05:57,220
Oh, fuck.

9210
06:05:57,280 --> 06:05:57,800
It's circular.

9211
06:05:58,380 --> 06:06:00,120
Oh, they're all circles!

9212
06:06:00,600 --> 06:06:01,780
I don't have circles!

9213
06:06:03,340 --> 06:06:03,940
Okay.

9214
06:06:04,640 --> 06:06:04,940
3000.

9215
06:06:05,360 --> 06:06:06,440
We need to...

9216
06:06:06,440 --> 06:06:08,660
help our fucking thing here.

9217
06:06:09,060 --> 06:06:11,360
And then... Our knife is okay right now.

9218
06:06:11,480 --> 06:06:11,980
It's okay.

9219
06:06:12,220 --> 06:06:14,900
I think I'm gonna save for this.

9220
06:06:15,160 --> 06:06:16,760
We need to save up for like...

9221
06:06:16,760 --> 06:06:17,460
gun upgrades.

9222
06:06:20,740 --> 06:06:22,380
We're gonna save for gun upgrades.

9223
06:06:23,240 --> 06:06:23,840
Shapes.

9224
06:06:25,100 --> 06:06:26,960
Doki does not do well with shapes.

9225
06:06:28,180 --> 06:06:30,000
Okay, we're gonna put this here.

9226
06:06:30,480 --> 06:06:31,600
And then...

9227
06:06:31,600 --> 06:06:32,800
I'm not gonna fix this.

9228
06:06:33,380 --> 06:06:36,020
I'm not gonna fix my inventory.

9229
06:06:37,020 --> 06:06:38,700
I'm not gonna fix my inventory.

9230
06:06:41,100 --> 06:06:42,420
Alright, we're fine.

9231
06:06:43,680 --> 06:06:44,340
Woo!

9232
06:06:46,100 --> 06:06:46,760
Yeah!

9233
06:06:48,240 --> 06:06:48,900
Alright.

9234
06:06:50,780 --> 06:06:53,440
That guy that was like, You're gonna miss the red guy.

9235
06:06:53,840 --> 06:06:55,900
I finally now know what he meant by that.

9236
06:06:58,100 --> 06:06:59,420
Oh my god.

9237
06:07:00,100 --> 06:07:01,000
Los Amigos!

9238
06:07:01,100 --> 06:07:02,080
Thank you for the Super Chat.

9239
06:07:02,180 --> 06:07:02,940
Thank you, thank you.

9240
06:07:05,040 --> 06:07:05,820
It's okay.

9241
06:07:06,720 --> 06:07:10,220
Nobody cares about what the inventory looks like.

9242
06:07:10,720 --> 06:07:11,740
No one cares!

9243
06:07:12,680 --> 06:07:14,080
It's still usable.

9244
06:07:15,720 --> 06:07:17,500
As long as it's usable.

9245
06:07:17,640 --> 06:07:18,920
That's all that matters.

9246
06:07:21,160 --> 06:07:23,020
Thank you for the Super Chat.

9247
06:07:23,120 --> 06:07:23,820
Thank you, thank you.

9248
06:07:23,840 --> 06:07:24,040
Thank you.

9249
06:07:24,040 --> 06:07:25,120
The last boss.

9250
06:07:25,240 --> 06:07:25,720
The puzzle.

9251
06:07:26,100 --> 06:07:28,220
The last boss reading.

9252
06:07:31,420 --> 06:07:32,160
Right here.

9253
06:07:34,500 --> 06:07:35,060
Reading.

9254
06:07:35,280 --> 06:07:36,820
The worst boss of them all.

9255
06:07:38,940 --> 06:07:40,700
Oh, it's hurting your OCD?

9256
06:07:42,220 --> 06:07:44,080
Let me make it better for you.

9257
06:07:49,260 --> 06:07:50,600
There you go.

9258
06:07:55,500 --> 06:07:56,940
Oh hey, there's a vase there.

9259
06:07:58,100 --> 06:07:58,620
Nice.

9260
06:08:00,700 --> 06:08:01,500
I'm helpful.

9261
06:08:05,080 --> 06:08:05,600
Alright.

9262
06:08:07,220 --> 06:08:08,420
This... Oh no!

9263
06:08:08,520 --> 06:08:09,240
It's the cube room!

9264
06:08:17,760 --> 06:08:18,760
Oh, no.

9265
06:08:18,800 --> 06:08:19,680
Not this room.

9266
06:08:24,420 --> 06:08:24,940
Okay.

9267
06:08:24,940 --> 06:08:26,000
Where are they?

9268
06:08:30,600 --> 06:08:31,820
Where are they?

9269
06:08:38,440 --> 06:08:39,680
They didn't hear that, right?

9270
06:08:42,760 --> 06:08:44,020
Guys, do you think they heard that?

9271
06:08:44,340 --> 06:08:45,020
No, right?

9272
06:08:47,340 --> 06:08:48,000
No, right?

9273
06:08:48,800 --> 06:08:49,820
I think I'm fine.

9274
06:08:50,920 --> 06:08:52,020
I think I'm fine.

9275
06:08:52,100 --> 06:08:53,060
I don't think they heard that.

9276
06:08:54,000 --> 06:08:54,440
Okay.

9277
06:08:56,080 --> 06:08:56,520
Alright.

9278
06:08:58,440 --> 06:08:58,980
That's fine.

9279
06:08:59,040 --> 06:08:59,560
They didn't hear.

9280
06:09:00,460 --> 06:09:02,020
I had a silencer on it.

9281
06:09:02,980 --> 06:09:04,600
Try to see where the others are.

9282
06:09:05,740 --> 06:09:06,900
I know like...

9283
06:09:07,780 --> 06:09:08,220
No!

9284
06:09:08,680 --> 06:09:10,300
How did he see me?

9285
06:09:13,940 --> 06:09:14,580
What?!

9286
06:09:17,020 --> 06:09:17,660
No!

9287
06:09:17,900 --> 06:09:19,500
How did I miss too?

9288
06:09:22,340 --> 06:09:23,900
What the f-

9289
06:09:27,280 --> 06:09:28,320
Boom.

9290
06:09:28,740 --> 06:09:29,380
Okay.

9291
06:09:30,020 --> 06:09:31,000
Outta the way.

9292
06:09:37,890 --> 06:09:39,330
How did I miss?

9293
06:09:39,610 --> 06:09:40,450
Shake, shake.

9294
06:09:40,570 --> 06:09:41,190
Shut up!

9295
06:09:41,190 --> 06:09:41,690
Don't shake!

9296
06:09:41,910 --> 06:09:42,870
Do not shake!

9297
06:10:05,600 --> 06:10:07,320
I can't be bothered.

9298
06:10:07,520 --> 06:10:08,020
Where?

9299
06:10:08,420 --> 06:10:09,060
Where?

9300
06:10:09,100 --> 06:10:09,260
Where?

9301
06:10:09,260 --> 06:10:09,360
Where?

9302
06:10:09,360 --> 06:10:09,780
Where?

9303
06:10:12,400 --> 06:10:12,980
Okay.

9304
06:10:17,880 --> 06:10:18,740
He dead?

9305
06:10:19,560 --> 06:10:20,380
He dead.

9306
06:10:22,800 --> 06:10:23,380
Okay.

9307
06:10:25,360 --> 06:10:26,340
What the fuck?

9308
06:10:26,340 --> 06:10:27,680
Where did you come from?

9309
06:10:30,680 --> 06:10:31,640
Okay, there we go.

9310
06:10:31,980 --> 06:10:33,640
Reloading, reloading, reloading!

9311
06:10:36,480 --> 06:10:37,380
Oh shit!

9312
06:10:37,540 --> 06:10:38,020
Boom!

9313
06:10:40,540 --> 06:10:41,120
Bye.

9314
06:10:41,700 --> 06:10:42,560
Oh fuck!

9315
06:10:43,640 --> 06:10:45,300
Shit, get over here Ashley.

9316
06:10:45,680 --> 06:10:46,840
I'm sorry Ashley.

9317
06:10:47,960 --> 06:10:48,520
Shake!

9318
06:10:48,700 --> 06:10:49,260
Shake!

9319
06:10:49,400 --> 06:10:49,880
Shake!

9320
06:10:50,180 --> 06:10:51,040
Okay, there we go.

9321
06:10:54,280 --> 06:10:55,440
Oh my god, please.

9322
06:10:55,580 --> 06:10:55,940
No!

9323
06:10:56,860 --> 06:10:57,420
Okay.

9324
06:10:58,040 --> 06:10:58,600
Okay.

9325
06:10:59,120 --> 06:10:59,680
Alright.

9326
06:11:00,580 --> 06:11:01,140
Kick!

9327
06:11:01,880 --> 06:11:02,260
Come on!

9328
06:11:03,060 --> 06:11:03,620
Nice.

9329
06:11:04,040 --> 06:11:05,120
Shoot you on the leg.

9330
06:11:07,160 --> 06:11:08,160
Oh no.

9331
06:11:08,280 --> 06:11:09,040
Oh no.

9332
06:11:10,400 --> 06:11:10,960
Leg!

9333
06:11:12,140 --> 06:11:12,820
Shake!

9334
06:11:12,960 --> 06:11:13,520
Shake!

9335
06:11:13,620 --> 06:11:14,000
Shake!

9336
06:11:14,060 --> 06:11:14,420
Shake!

9337
06:11:14,520 --> 06:11:14,900
Shake!

9338
06:11:14,980 --> 06:11:15,260
Shake!

9339
06:11:16,200 --> 06:11:17,360
There we go.

9340
06:11:17,460 --> 06:11:17,900
They're all dead.

9341
06:11:19,180 --> 06:11:19,980
We're fine.

9342
06:11:20,200 --> 06:11:20,860
Thanks.

9343
06:11:22,780 --> 06:11:23,620
We're okay.

9344
06:11:24,740 --> 06:11:26,020
Shanking always works.

9345
06:11:26,180 --> 06:11:28,060
Remember to always shank, guys.

9346
06:11:28,700 --> 06:11:30,900
Remember to always shank.

9347
06:11:30,960 --> 06:11:31,480
Shank.

9348
06:11:32,840 --> 06:11:33,720
There we go.

9349
06:11:36,000 --> 06:11:37,860
There's always shanking time.

9350
06:11:39,400 --> 06:11:41,100
One more just to...

9351
06:11:41,120 --> 06:11:41,720
be sure.

9352
06:11:41,940 --> 06:11:44,000
You gotta double shank, man.

9353
06:11:44,400 --> 06:11:47,180
You always have to double shank, guys.

9354
06:11:51,030 --> 06:11:51,550
Okay.

9355
06:11:52,270 --> 06:11:53,670
Where the fuck is that rat?

9356
06:11:54,070 --> 06:11:55,790
I'm still missing one more rat.

9357
06:11:59,110 --> 06:12:00,150
Almost shanked.

9358
06:12:00,150 --> 06:12:01,210
Ashley, she's fine.

9359
06:12:02,070 --> 06:12:04,210
If she's not fine, she would tell me.

9360
06:12:04,250 --> 06:12:04,910
Right, Ashley?

9361
06:12:06,110 --> 06:12:06,970
Right, Ashley?

9362
06:12:07,050 --> 06:12:09,870
You would tell Uncle Leon if it's not fine.

9363
06:12:09,870 --> 06:12:11,130
You remember that.

9364
06:12:11,730 --> 06:12:13,130
Tell Uncle Leon.

9365
06:12:15,050 --> 06:12:17,390
If it's not fine, just let me know.

9366
06:12:19,190 --> 06:12:20,610
I ran past it?

9367
06:12:20,650 --> 06:12:21,710
Where the fuck was the rat?

9368
06:12:26,560 --> 06:12:27,460
Wait, there's a green...

9369
06:12:27,460 --> 06:12:28,220
Oh, there is a green area.

9370
06:12:28,340 --> 06:12:28,760
Nice.

9371
06:12:33,160 --> 06:12:34,220
No rats here.

9372
06:12:35,180 --> 06:12:36,560
This is a clean area.

9373
06:12:38,800 --> 06:12:40,200
This area is clean.

9374
06:12:40,200 --> 06:12:40,480
It's clean.

9375
06:12:43,260 --> 06:12:45,860
It isn't until after Ashley...

9376
06:12:45,860 --> 06:12:47,160
What the fuck do you mean?

9377
06:12:48,080 --> 06:12:50,180
What do you mean?

9378
06:12:50,180 --> 06:12:51,020
I don't like that.

9379
06:12:51,380 --> 06:12:53,560
I don't like that.

9380
06:13:00,440 --> 06:13:01,600
Okay, here we go.

9381
06:13:07,730 --> 06:13:08,290
Nice.

9382
06:13:08,370 --> 06:13:09,730
We're doing it, Ashley.

9383
06:13:10,870 --> 06:13:12,470
We're fucking doing it.

9384
06:13:13,250 --> 06:13:15,030
Okay, we gotta reload our...

9385
06:13:15,750 --> 06:13:17,410
We gotta reload our rifle.

9386
06:13:17,710 --> 06:13:18,010
We gotta reload our rifle.

9387
06:13:20,830 --> 06:13:21,350
Alright.

9388
06:13:22,210 --> 06:13:23,210
Up we go.

9389
06:13:24,410 --> 06:13:26,050
Can we unlock this door?

9390
06:13:26,110 --> 06:13:26,670
Oh, there it is.

9391
06:13:26,830 --> 06:13:27,350
Nice.

9392
06:13:32,590 --> 06:13:33,330
There we go.

9393
06:13:33,950 --> 06:13:35,310
We got the goat head.

9394
06:13:35,710 --> 06:13:36,130
Yay!

9395
06:13:38,010 --> 06:13:39,290
Oh my god.

9396
06:13:39,330 --> 06:13:40,110
Look at all this ammo.

9397
06:13:40,590 --> 06:13:43,990
It's like I never wasted anything other than the flash grenade.

9398
06:13:44,150 --> 06:13:44,930
It's like I never wasted anything other than the flash grenade.

9399
06:13:46,030 --> 06:13:46,550
What?

9400
06:13:47,710 --> 06:13:48,230
Fuck!

9401
06:13:49,670 --> 06:13:50,190
Sorry.

9402
06:13:50,510 --> 06:13:51,030
Sorry.

9403
06:13:51,070 --> 06:13:52,890
That scared the shit out of me.

9404
06:13:54,450 --> 06:13:56,530
I wasn't ready for that.

9405
06:13:58,250 --> 06:13:59,170
Oh god.

9406
06:13:59,250 --> 06:13:59,590
Okay.

9407
06:13:59,910 --> 06:14:00,430
Okay.

9408
06:14:02,730 --> 06:14:04,750
I was like, what do you mean watch out?

9409
06:14:04,950 --> 06:14:06,270
Like, what do you mean?

9410
06:14:07,570 --> 06:14:09,430
I couldn't tell what he meant.

9411
06:14:13,750 --> 06:14:14,270
Alright.

9412
06:14:14,530 --> 06:14:15,030
Shake!

9413
06:14:15,150 --> 06:14:15,450
Shake!

9414
06:14:15,570 --> 06:14:15,910
Shake!

9415
06:14:15,970 --> 06:14:16,250
Shake!

9416
06:14:16,450 --> 06:14:16,690
Shake!

9417
06:14:17,730 --> 06:14:18,470
There we go.

9418
06:14:19,470 --> 06:14:19,950
Nice.

9419
06:14:21,190 --> 06:14:22,370
She did... Yeah!

9420
06:14:22,450 --> 06:14:23,850
Like 20 seconds later!

9421
06:14:27,460 --> 06:14:28,420
It's not helpful!

9422
06:14:28,920 --> 06:14:30,520
That's not helpful.

9423
06:14:32,680 --> 06:14:33,600
Oh, I missed ammo?

9424
06:14:33,900 --> 06:14:34,320
Did I?

9425
06:14:34,480 --> 06:14:35,460
Oh, I did.

9426
06:14:36,100 --> 06:14:38,120
Bro, I missed out like resources and...

9427
06:14:38,120 --> 06:14:38,520
Wait!

9428
06:14:38,620 --> 06:14:40,460
I missed out on resources and flash grenade!

9429
06:14:40,640 --> 06:14:41,180
We gotta go back.

9430
06:14:41,660 --> 06:14:42,960
Ashley, we have to go back.

9431
06:14:43,000 --> 06:14:43,280
Ashley.

9432
06:14:43,280 --> 06:14:43,360
Ashley.

9433
06:14:46,280 --> 06:14:47,500
We have to go back.

9434
06:14:48,240 --> 06:14:48,720
We have to go back.

9435
06:14:48,920 --> 06:14:50,420
It's like we never lost anything.

9436
06:14:50,980 --> 06:14:53,140
Now it's like we never lost anything!

9437
06:14:53,940 --> 06:14:54,720
Look at that!

9438
06:14:57,780 --> 06:14:58,760
I'm just blind.

9439
06:14:58,920 --> 06:14:59,080
I'm just blind.

9440
06:14:59,080 --> 06:15:00,520
As always, treasure under the bridge.

9441
06:15:00,700 --> 06:15:00,820
Oh!

9442
06:15:03,000 --> 06:15:03,860
Oh hey, treasure!

9443
06:15:06,880 --> 06:15:07,360
Yeah!

9444
06:15:07,980 --> 06:15:08,460
Treasure!

9445
06:15:08,720 --> 06:15:10,000
It's just a yellow diamond.

9446
06:15:11,020 --> 06:15:12,320
That's the shittiest treasure.

9447
06:15:13,860 --> 06:15:14,860
And then...

9448
06:15:14,860 --> 06:15:16,100
There is shotgun shells.

9449
06:15:16,180 --> 06:15:17,240
Wait, where the fuck is that?

9450
06:15:21,150 --> 06:15:22,310
Oh, it's like...

9451
06:15:22,310 --> 06:15:23,490
Over here?

9452
06:15:25,070 --> 06:15:26,750
Where the fuck do I get there?

9453
06:15:27,490 --> 06:15:28,810
Where the fuck do I get there?

9454
06:15:29,110 --> 06:15:30,130
Oh, it's at the top.

9455
06:15:30,230 --> 06:15:30,410
Okay.

9456
06:15:32,750 --> 06:15:33,310
Oh, it's at the top.

9457
06:15:33,310 --> 06:15:33,310
Okay.

9458
06:15:33,310 --> 06:15:33,310
Okay.

9459
06:15:33,390 --> 06:15:33,930
Nice.

9460
06:15:36,450 --> 06:15:37,010
Nice.

9461
06:15:37,070 --> 06:15:38,150
We're learning, Ashley.

9462
06:15:40,070 --> 06:15:41,270
We're learning, Ashley.

9463
06:15:44,780 --> 06:15:45,860
Where is that?

9464
06:15:47,180 --> 06:15:47,920
Where is that?

9465
06:15:50,220 --> 06:15:50,820
What?

9466
06:15:51,520 --> 06:15:52,120
Oh!

9467
06:15:52,320 --> 06:15:54,760
It's on the fucking banister!

9468
06:15:57,040 --> 06:15:59,920
Sorry, it was on the banister, guys.

9469
06:16:00,340 --> 06:16:00,560
Sorry, it was on the banister, guys.

9470
06:16:00,560 --> 06:16:00,800
Sorry, it was on the banister, guys.

9471
06:16:01,800 --> 06:16:02,900
Alright, here we go.

9472
06:16:04,300 --> 06:16:05,220
Yeah, nice.

9473
06:16:06,840 --> 06:16:08,120
We did it, Ashley.

9474
06:16:08,600 --> 06:16:10,040
We fucking did it.

9475
06:16:10,080 --> 06:16:10,780
We're gamers.

9476
06:16:12,280 --> 06:16:13,000
We're fucking gamers.

9477
06:16:13,020 --> 06:16:13,780
Fucking gaming.

9478
06:16:15,520 --> 06:16:16,760
I'm so proud of us.

9479
06:16:17,260 --> 06:16:18,560
Ashley, you and I.

9480
06:16:19,340 --> 06:16:20,940
You and I against the world.

9481
06:16:25,070 --> 06:16:26,350
Okay, we gotta save now.

9482
06:16:27,870 --> 06:16:28,790
Oh yeah, we did.

9483
06:16:28,890 --> 06:16:30,250
Let's get that request real fast.

9484
06:16:31,950 --> 06:16:32,390
Nice!

9485
06:16:32,510 --> 06:16:34,810
How much money do I have?

9486
06:16:34,890 --> 06:16:35,670
I still don't have a lot.

9487
06:16:35,970 --> 06:16:37,610
I'm still broke as fuck.

9488
06:16:38,330 --> 06:16:41,070
Uh, yeah, we need like...

9489
06:16:42,230 --> 06:16:42,670
Anything?

9490
06:16:42,830 --> 06:16:43,250
Will you...

9491
06:16:44,870 --> 06:16:48,390
What if I like sell Ashley to him and then like I'll buy Ashley back?

9492
06:16:48,870 --> 06:16:49,870
So then like I...

9493
06:16:49,870 --> 06:16:50,850
I mean like...

9494
06:16:50,850 --> 06:16:52,090
He's everywhere.

9495
06:16:52,450 --> 06:16:53,630
So then I don't have to...

9496
06:16:53,630 --> 06:16:55,690
What if I pay you to babysit Ashley?

9497
06:16:57,150 --> 06:16:59,230
Can I pay him to babysit Ashley?

9498
06:16:59,750 --> 06:17:01,710
That'd be so convenient, man.

9499
06:17:01,890 --> 06:17:03,210
If he likes money that much.

9500
06:17:05,970 --> 06:17:07,510
Like a pawn shop.

9501
06:17:07,510 --> 06:17:07,630
A pawn shop?

9502
06:17:11,090 --> 06:17:12,630
Alone Ashley.

9503
06:17:15,330 --> 06:17:16,590
Wait a minute.

9504
06:17:19,390 --> 06:17:19,930
What?

9505
06:17:27,840 --> 06:17:28,920
No!

9506
06:17:30,600 --> 06:17:33,220
That was the Ashley part!

9507
06:17:36,180 --> 06:17:38,140
Not the Ashley chapter.

9508
06:17:38,880 --> 06:17:41,360
Not the Ashley chapter.

9509
06:17:47,760 --> 06:17:48,480
Nooo!

9510
06:17:53,300 --> 06:17:55,120
One fear.

9511
06:17:55,900 --> 06:17:58,460
One fucking fear.

9512
06:18:11,790 --> 06:18:13,890
Oh no!

9513
06:18:14,350 --> 06:18:14,730
No!

9514
06:18:15,730 --> 06:18:18,670
One fucking fear!

9515
06:18:18,670 --> 06:18:18,990
Yeah!

9516
06:18:21,390 --> 06:18:23,730
The nightmare begins!

9517
06:18:29,620 --> 06:18:33,110
Oh my god, the true hell awaits!

9518
06:18:38,660 --> 06:18:39,690
Real hell.

9519
06:18:43,040 --> 06:18:44,230
Alright, here we go.

9520
06:18:48,300 --> 06:18:50,640
Oh god, alright, here we go.

9521
06:18:52,140 --> 06:18:53,460
Real hell here.

9522
06:18:55,700 --> 06:18:57,940
Oh my god, dude, fuck off!

9523
06:18:59,800 --> 06:19:01,220
Oh, there's a rat.

9524
06:19:01,420 --> 06:19:02,640
Can I fucking punch the rat?

9525
06:19:02,760 --> 06:19:04,420
I can't punch the fucking rat, okay.

9526
06:19:06,780 --> 06:19:08,080
This is real hell.

9527
06:19:08,980 --> 06:19:10,200
This is real hell.

9528
06:19:10,220 --> 06:19:11,600
Why do you walk so slow?

9529
06:19:17,460 --> 06:19:19,340
God, this is the worst part.

9530
06:19:19,460 --> 06:19:21,600
This is the worst part.

9531
06:19:22,800 --> 06:19:24,940
This is the worst part of this game.

9532
06:19:26,260 --> 06:19:27,780
I don't have gun.

9533
06:19:28,120 --> 06:19:30,280
I don't know gun.

9534
06:19:30,540 --> 06:19:31,060
Hell.

9535
06:19:31,700 --> 06:19:35,300
The resting forbearer answers to the chosen time.

9536
06:19:35,500 --> 06:19:38,580
If it's the Lord's blessing you seek, have courage.

9537
06:19:38,720 --> 06:19:39,000
If it's the Lord's blessing you seek, have courage.

9538
06:19:39,000 --> 06:19:39,940
Oh yeah, thank you.

9539
06:19:40,060 --> 06:19:41,080
Thank you, thank you.

9540
06:19:41,140 --> 06:19:42,680
I'm just gonna have courage.

9541
06:19:43,180 --> 06:19:43,920
Thank you.

9542
06:19:44,720 --> 06:19:47,480
Guys, can I like, guys, please just backseat me.

9543
06:19:47,680 --> 06:19:48,200
Please.

9544
06:19:50,740 --> 06:19:51,640
Guys, please.

9545
06:19:52,160 --> 06:19:53,340
Please, just tell me.

9546
06:19:53,420 --> 06:19:54,160
Just tell me.

9547
06:19:58,960 --> 06:20:01,060
Please, just tell me the time.

9548
06:20:01,920 --> 06:20:03,420
Get me out of here.

9549
06:20:04,460 --> 06:20:04,940
Please.

9550
06:20:10,600 --> 06:20:11,080
Please.

9551
06:20:12,560 --> 06:20:13,040
Please.

9552
06:20:13,660 --> 06:20:15,780
Maybe, guys, I have an idea.

9553
06:20:16,600 --> 06:20:17,980
I have an idea.

9554
06:20:18,860 --> 06:20:19,440
Eventually, I'm gonna be able to do this.

9555
06:20:19,460 --> 06:20:21,480
I'll use my wooden keyboard.

9556
06:20:21,700 --> 06:20:23,860
Guys, I have an idea.

9557
06:20:24,240 --> 06:20:25,300
I have...

9558
06:20:31,630 --> 06:20:33,050
Okay, what if...

9559
06:20:34,170 --> 06:20:35,290
What if...

9560
06:20:35,290 --> 06:20:36,930
Okay, I give up.

9561
06:20:40,810 --> 06:20:41,930
Oh, hell.

9562
06:20:42,670 --> 06:20:43,510
Actual hell.

9563
06:20:44,430 --> 06:20:45,370
Actual hell.

9564
06:20:45,630 --> 06:20:48,230
I honestly thought it would be a new chapter.

9565
06:20:48,390 --> 06:20:50,430
And then I can be like, hee hee, new chapter.

9566
06:20:50,930 --> 06:20:51,890
I guess we'll play it next time.

9567
06:20:52,270 --> 06:20:52,770
I...

9568
06:20:57,350 --> 06:20:59,010
I lose gun.

9569
06:20:59,290 --> 06:21:01,270
Now I don't know what to do.

9570
06:21:01,870 --> 06:21:02,870
No gun.

9571
06:21:03,090 --> 06:21:03,810
No game.

9572
06:21:05,170 --> 06:21:06,110
No gun.

9573
06:21:07,510 --> 06:21:08,470
No gun.

9574
06:21:08,710 --> 06:21:09,350
Confused.

9575
06:21:17,260 --> 06:21:20,000
What to do when you have no gun.

9576
06:21:20,960 --> 06:21:22,940
What to do when you have no gun.

9577
06:21:24,580 --> 06:21:26,360
What to do when you have no gun.

9578
06:21:26,360 --> 06:21:27,080
What to do when you have no gun.

9579
06:21:27,080 --> 06:21:28,200
What do you do?

9580
06:21:37,260 --> 06:21:39,940
Oh my god.

9581
06:21:42,700 --> 06:21:45,200
What is life without a gun?

9582
06:21:46,620 --> 06:21:47,420
What is life without a gun?

9583
06:21:47,420 --> 06:21:49,860
I know this section is inspiring any...

9584
06:21:49,860 --> 06:21:50,380
I know this section is inspiring any...

9585
06:21:50,380 --> 06:21:51,940
She loves this.

9586
06:21:52,320 --> 06:21:53,660
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

9587
06:21:53,860 --> 06:21:54,800
Be right back.

9588
06:21:55,460 --> 06:21:57,220
Be right back.

9589
06:23:02,190 --> 06:23:02,830
Okay.

9590
06:23:02,830 --> 06:23:02,830
Okay,

9591
06:23:09,270 --> 06:23:09,730
here we go.

9592
06:23:12,970 --> 06:23:13,610
Where...

9593
06:23:22,470 --> 06:23:24,790
What if...

9594
06:23:26,250 --> 06:23:28,330
Oh, I hate this game.

9595
06:23:31,810 --> 06:23:33,090
Go fast.

9596
06:23:33,310 --> 06:23:34,290
Gotta go fast.

9597
06:23:34,390 --> 06:23:36,290
If I go fast, I can't get scared.

9598
06:23:40,810 --> 06:23:41,370
I'm scared!

9599
06:23:41,370 --> 06:23:43,570
If I keep running.

9600
06:23:43,990 --> 06:23:45,370
If I keep running!

9601
06:23:46,250 --> 06:23:47,450
Oh hey, I got the key.

9602
06:23:47,630 --> 06:23:48,010
Nice.

9603
06:23:52,830 --> 06:23:54,750
Wait, what?

9604
06:23:55,610 --> 06:23:56,910
The fuck was that?

9605
06:23:59,010 --> 06:23:59,910
What was that?

9606
06:24:00,810 --> 06:24:01,770
What was that?

9607
06:24:03,150 --> 06:24:04,270
What was that?

9608
06:24:06,290 --> 06:24:07,430
What was that guys?

9609
06:24:13,730 --> 06:24:15,110
If I keep running!

9610
06:24:18,770 --> 06:24:19,230
No!

9611
06:24:19,730 --> 06:24:20,650
Be gone!

9612
06:24:23,050 --> 06:24:24,470
Be gone!

9613
06:24:36,880 --> 06:24:37,800
Fish!

9614
06:24:38,200 --> 06:24:39,520
I don't know!

9615
06:24:40,920 --> 06:24:41,380
This!

9616
06:24:45,780 --> 06:24:46,780
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

9617
06:24:46,820 --> 06:24:47,280
Elevator.

9618
06:24:47,380 --> 06:24:48,020
Elevator.

9619
06:24:48,140 --> 06:24:48,780
Elevator.

9620
06:24:54,680 --> 06:24:55,480
Elon!

9621
06:24:57,740 --> 06:24:58,540
Okay, here we go.

9622
06:24:58,920 --> 06:25:00,260
Oh no.

9623
06:25:00,480 --> 06:25:01,260
Oh no.

9624
06:25:03,080 --> 06:25:04,460
Oh no.

9625
06:25:08,300 --> 06:25:10,860
Just, please... get me out!

9626
06:25:11,120 --> 06:25:12,300
Where's Leon?

9627
06:25:12,780 --> 06:25:14,280
I'm still running!

9628
06:25:18,700 --> 06:25:19,900
Where's Leon?

9629
06:25:20,160 --> 06:25:22,520
He told me to run and I'm still running.

9630
06:25:26,360 --> 06:25:27,460
No, I'm not.

9631
06:25:27,500 --> 06:25:28,220
I'm not okay.

9632
06:25:29,820 --> 06:25:31,200
Thank you for the super chat.

9633
06:25:31,300 --> 06:25:31,540
Thank you.

9634
06:25:31,580 --> 06:25:32,340
Thank you.

9635
06:25:32,340 --> 06:25:33,840
Thank you for the super chat.

9636
06:25:35,120 --> 06:25:36,720
Devastator, thank you for the super chat.

9637
06:25:36,820 --> 06:25:37,060
Thank you.

9638
06:25:37,140 --> 06:25:37,620
Thank you.

9639
06:25:39,840 --> 06:25:41,660
Oh, the insignia.

9640
06:25:41,700 --> 06:25:46,820
The key to getting out of this confined place is the Salazar family insignia.

9641
06:25:46,820 --> 06:25:50,000
The final must venture to where the cursed armor awaits.

9642
06:25:50,180 --> 06:25:51,100
The underground...

9643
06:25:51,100 --> 06:25:52,260
Oh no, not the underground.

9644
06:25:53,540 --> 06:25:57,360
Oh, merciful Lord.

9645
06:25:57,860 --> 06:26:01,360
And that your righteous justice upon the wicked usurper.

9646
06:26:01,520 --> 06:26:04,480
The maniacal monster, Raymond Salazar.

9647
06:26:06,740 --> 06:26:11,280
And may your blessed blue light protect you forever, you faithful servant.

9648
06:26:12,520 --> 06:26:14,160
Oh no, come on.

9649
06:26:15,100 --> 06:26:16,360
Yes, this is it.

9650
06:26:17,060 --> 06:26:18,020
This is it.

9651
06:26:19,140 --> 06:26:20,080
This is it.

9652
06:26:20,140 --> 06:26:21,300
We can figure this out.

9653
06:26:25,460 --> 06:26:26,480
We can...

9654
06:26:26,480 --> 06:26:28,620
We can figure this out.

9655
06:26:28,880 --> 06:26:30,800
We can figure this out.

9656
06:26:34,900 --> 06:26:36,060
This is it.

9657
06:26:36,380 --> 06:26:38,000
This is... 1104!

9658
06:26:38,400 --> 06:26:39,000
Okay.

9659
06:26:39,520 --> 06:26:40,120
That's...

9660
06:26:40,600 --> 06:26:40,900
Wait.

9661
06:26:41,080 --> 06:26:42,160
I did it.

9662
06:26:42,980 --> 06:26:45,540
I knew it would eventually work.

9663
06:26:46,200 --> 06:26:49,300
I knew it would eventually work, guys.

9664
06:26:50,020 --> 06:26:52,140
I fucking knew it.

9665
06:27:01,900 --> 06:27:04,640
Does this mean I can skip everything now?

9666
06:27:11,580 --> 06:27:12,520
Oh my god.

9667
06:27:12,860 --> 06:27:14,580
Oh my god, this is it.

9668
06:27:14,900 --> 06:27:15,940
This is it.

9669
06:27:16,820 --> 06:27:17,860
This is not it.

9670
06:27:18,480 --> 06:27:19,560
This is not it.

9671
06:27:20,560 --> 06:27:21,740
Nice is not it.

9672
06:27:29,380 --> 06:27:30,140
Wait, what?

9673
06:27:33,140 --> 06:27:34,900
Okay, we're gonna shine this.

9674
06:27:35,360 --> 06:27:37,160
And then...

9675
06:27:45,350 --> 06:27:45,870
Shine!

9676
06:27:47,350 --> 06:27:47,870
Shine!

9677
06:27:47,910 --> 06:27:48,930
Where am I?

9678
06:27:49,390 --> 06:27:51,610
Oh, I have to go all the way back!

9679
06:27:56,800 --> 06:27:58,320
Don't look back!

9680
06:27:58,480 --> 06:27:59,140
Don't look back!

9681
06:28:01,000 --> 06:28:01,860
Where's the clock?

9682
06:28:02,000 --> 06:28:02,560
Where's the clock?

9683
06:28:03,020 --> 06:28:03,340
1104!

9684
06:28:04,220 --> 06:28:05,340
There we go.

9685
06:28:11,620 --> 06:28:13,080
We did it.

9686
06:28:14,540 --> 06:28:16,200
We did it, guys.

9687
06:28:16,680 --> 06:28:17,880
We're gamers.

9688
06:28:19,000 --> 06:28:20,840
I can't believe it.

9689
06:28:21,960 --> 06:28:22,600
1104.

9690
06:28:29,360 --> 06:28:30,640
I speedrun!

9691
06:28:31,180 --> 06:28:32,880
I don't know, I just figured it out.

9692
06:28:33,560 --> 06:28:33,960
Guys...

9693
06:28:35,060 --> 06:28:35,860
I just...

9694
06:28:35,860 --> 06:28:38,100
I just kept... I just knew.

9695
06:28:39,440 --> 06:28:40,240
Come on.

9696
06:28:40,480 --> 06:28:41,120
Come on.

9697
06:28:41,580 --> 06:28:43,320
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

9698
06:28:43,500 --> 06:28:43,900
Go.

9699
06:28:45,620 --> 06:28:48,160
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

9700
06:28:49,660 --> 06:28:50,520
Go, go, go.

9701
06:28:51,300 --> 06:28:51,700
Okay.

9702
06:28:51,980 --> 06:28:52,840
And then we go.

9703
06:28:53,120 --> 06:28:53,980
And then we go.

9704
06:28:54,860 --> 06:28:55,760
And then we go.

9705
06:28:56,240 --> 06:28:57,260
And then we go.

9706
06:28:59,540 --> 06:29:00,340
Oh, shit!

9707
06:29:00,900 --> 06:29:01,300
No!

9708
06:29:08,500 --> 06:29:11,040
Guys, no one likes Ashley levels!

9709
06:29:15,180 --> 06:29:18,660
No one likes the Ashley levels!

9710
06:29:18,980 --> 06:29:20,460
Don't f***ing pretend!

9711
06:29:21,920 --> 06:29:25,220
Don't be righteous with me right now!

9712
06:29:33,980 --> 06:29:36,120
Don't act all f***ing righteous.

9713
06:29:37,840 --> 06:29:38,680
What's this?

9714
06:29:39,000 --> 06:29:41,020
Eagle... wait, what is this?

9715
06:29:41,440 --> 06:29:42,680
Wait, that's everything.

9716
06:29:43,060 --> 06:29:45,380
Eagle, fish, snake, crow.

9717
06:29:47,920 --> 06:29:49,900
I like it right now.

9718
06:29:50,100 --> 06:29:51,520
Well, I'm doing it!

9719
06:29:51,780 --> 06:29:53,520
Are you not entertained?

9720
06:29:56,400 --> 06:29:58,140
Yeah, same Ashley.

9721
06:29:59,840 --> 06:30:02,020
Finally, I can relate to you!

9722
06:30:04,120 --> 06:30:04,800
Finally, I can relate to you!

9723
06:30:06,120 --> 06:30:07,580
Finally, some relatability!

9724
06:30:13,640 --> 06:30:18,420
Oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god!

9725
06:30:18,540 --> 06:30:18,940
I'm ready!

9726
06:30:21,080 --> 06:30:22,620
Oh my god, please!

9727
06:30:24,400 --> 06:30:26,180
Get me out of here!

9728
06:30:29,120 --> 06:30:32,840
Oh my god, I'm here!

9729
06:30:32,900 --> 06:30:33,740
What's this?

9730
06:30:34,720 --> 06:30:37,360
Moon... okay, moon...

9731
06:30:39,460 --> 06:30:41,200
What is this?

9732
06:30:41,240 --> 06:30:42,620
Is this a star or a moon?

9733
06:30:42,820 --> 06:30:44,100
Oh wait, no...

9734
06:30:45,140 --> 06:30:47,180
Oh my god, it's right here.

9735
06:30:48,080 --> 06:30:50,260
Oh my god, okay.

9736
06:30:51,000 --> 06:30:53,940
Moon... star...

9737
06:30:57,640 --> 06:30:58,480
This is it?

9738
06:30:59,620 --> 06:31:00,100
No?

9739
06:31:02,560 --> 06:31:03,700
Not the right moon?

9740
06:31:04,680 --> 06:31:05,900
How is there a min- how...

9741
06:31:06,820 --> 06:31:07,920
How are there more moons?

9742
06:31:09,560 --> 06:31:10,600
Oh, there we go.

9743
06:31:10,640 --> 06:31:11,800
That was a big moon.

9744
06:31:12,360 --> 06:31:14,360
Okay, I had the wrong moon.

9745
06:31:14,660 --> 06:31:15,680
I sound tired?

9746
06:31:15,980 --> 06:31:17,400
I'm playing Ashley, man.

9747
06:31:21,200 --> 06:31:23,840
Anybody will be tired playing this level.

9748
06:31:23,880 --> 06:31:26,020
I feel like I aged 80 years playing Ashley.

9749
06:31:34,290 --> 06:31:37,210
Oh god, oh god, tell me I just ran!

9750
06:31:37,410 --> 06:31:37,750
No!

9751
06:31:38,170 --> 06:31:39,070
Come on!

9752
06:31:40,550 --> 06:31:41,770
Ashley, don't look back!

9753
06:31:41,870 --> 06:31:43,170
Ashley, don't look back!

9754
06:31:43,490 --> 06:31:45,050
Ashley, don't look back!

9755
06:31:45,210 --> 06:31:47,490
Where the fuck do I go?

9756
06:31:50,450 --> 06:31:53,330
Oh, I mean, let me just use this key, I guess.

9757
06:31:53,710 --> 06:31:54,890
Guys, this is important.

9758
06:31:56,250 --> 06:31:57,330
Guys, don't worry.

9759
06:31:57,470 --> 06:31:58,550
We're gonna figure out the key.

9760
06:31:59,370 --> 06:32:01,430
Guys, this is very important.

9761
06:32:05,010 --> 06:32:07,050
We got an emerald, guys.

9762
06:32:07,150 --> 06:32:08,430
This is so important.

9763
06:32:09,150 --> 06:32:11,030
We got an emerald.

9764
06:32:13,470 --> 06:32:15,590
Good nights, and stay still.

9765
06:32:17,350 --> 06:32:18,430
Guys, this is important.

9766
06:32:18,610 --> 06:32:19,130
This is important.

9767
06:32:19,250 --> 06:32:19,710
This is important.

9768
06:32:19,870 --> 06:32:20,730
Where do I go?

9769
06:32:20,850 --> 06:32:22,170
Where the fuck do I go?

9770
06:32:22,270 --> 06:32:23,570
Where do I go?

9771
06:32:25,590 --> 06:32:26,530
Get up!

9772
06:32:27,130 --> 06:32:28,070
Oh god.

9773
06:32:28,210 --> 06:32:29,150
Oh god.

9774
06:32:29,270 --> 06:32:30,410
Oh fuck!

9775
06:32:33,110 --> 06:32:33,970
This is good.

9776
06:32:34,010 --> 06:32:34,690
This is bad.

9777
06:32:34,790 --> 06:32:35,470
This is bad.

9778
06:32:35,810 --> 06:32:36,710
Press the elevator!

9779
06:32:37,170 --> 06:32:37,890
Press the button!

9780
06:32:37,950 --> 06:32:38,390
Press the button!

9781
06:32:38,530 --> 06:32:38,890
Okay.

9782
06:32:39,730 --> 06:32:40,490
Okay, we're good.

9783
06:32:40,550 --> 06:32:40,830
We're good.

9784
06:32:40,850 --> 06:32:41,190
We're good.

9785
06:32:41,510 --> 06:32:41,730
We're good.

9786
06:32:41,870 --> 06:32:42,190
We're good.

9787
06:32:42,230 --> 06:32:42,430
We're good.

9788
06:32:42,430 --> 06:32:42,550
We're good.

9789
06:32:42,590 --> 06:32:42,890
We're good.

9790
06:32:42,970 --> 06:32:43,210
Goodbye.

9791
06:32:44,870 --> 06:32:45,230
Goodbye.

9792
06:32:48,070 --> 06:32:48,430
Okay.

9793
06:32:50,330 --> 06:32:51,510
Alright, here I am.

9794
06:32:51,570 --> 06:32:52,510
I don't know where to go.

9795
06:32:53,130 --> 06:32:54,010
Where do I go?

9796
06:32:54,950 --> 06:32:55,310
Where?

9797
06:32:55,630 --> 06:32:56,910
How do I get there?

9798
06:32:57,690 --> 06:32:58,090
Okay.

9799
06:32:59,630 --> 06:33:00,810
How do I get there?

9800
06:33:00,870 --> 06:33:01,530
How do I get there?

9801
06:33:01,630 --> 06:33:02,630
How do I get there?

9802
06:33:03,390 --> 06:33:04,130
How do I?

9803
06:33:04,530 --> 06:33:04,930
What?

9804
06:33:15,910 --> 06:33:16,510
There we go.

9805
06:33:17,050 --> 06:33:17,930
Just keep running.

9806
06:33:18,090 --> 06:33:18,890
Just keep running.

9807
06:33:19,050 --> 06:33:19,910
Just keep running.

9808
06:33:20,050 --> 06:33:20,890
Just keep running.

9809
06:33:22,550 --> 06:33:23,350
Where do I go?

9810
06:33:23,470 --> 06:33:24,190
Where do I go?

9811
06:33:24,290 --> 06:33:25,070
Where do I go?

9812
06:33:27,310 --> 06:33:28,310
Where do I go?

9813
06:33:33,080 --> 06:33:33,720
Do I?

9814
06:33:34,140 --> 06:33:35,840
Do I go here?

9815
06:33:36,820 --> 06:33:37,220
Here?

9816
06:33:47,040 --> 06:33:49,120
I don't know where to go!

9817
06:33:53,200 --> 06:33:53,680
Here!

9818
06:33:54,680 --> 06:33:55,160

Straight!

9820
06:33:56,300 --> 06:33:57,220
Do I go straight?

9821
06:34:00,580 --> 06:34:01,480
Where's the blue light?

9822
06:34:01,660 --> 06:34:02,780
Where's the blue light?

9823
06:34:06,080 --> 06:34:07,920
I don't know where to go!

9824
06:34:11,280 --> 06:34:12,800
No, don't go straight.

9825
06:34:13,020 --> 06:34:13,460
Library!

9826
06:34:13,560 --> 06:34:16,280
I swear, I feel like you're fucking with me right now.

9827
06:34:16,280 --> 06:34:18,260
Library and up the stairs.

9828
06:34:18,280 --> 06:34:18,480
Here?

9829
06:34:18,780 --> 06:34:19,300

Yes!

9835
06:34:35,950 --> 06:34:36,730
Okay.

9836
06:34:36,890 --> 06:34:37,650
Okay.

9837
06:34:37,670 --> 06:34:38,250
Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

9842
06:34:45,570 --> 06:34:46,410
Okay.

9843
06:34:46,410 --> 06:34:46,890
Okay.

Here.

9845
06:34:47,530 --> 06:34:48,170
Here.

9846
06:34:48,590 --> 06:34:50,250
Not there?!

9847
06:34:50,250 --> 06:34:51,570
I'm so confused!

9848
06:34:53,810 --> 06:34:54,490
What?!

9849
06:34:57,090 --> 06:34:58,610
Go back?!

9850
06:35:00,650 --> 06:35:02,390
Oh my god!

9851
06:35:02,790 --> 06:35:04,590
Oh my god!

9852
06:35:05,030 --> 06:35:05,790
Where?!

9853
06:35:07,370 --> 06:35:08,130
Where?!

9854
06:35:11,450 --> 06:35:12,830
Oh my god!

9855
06:35:13,030 --> 06:35:14,690
I got baited?!

9856
06:35:18,240 --> 06:35:18,620
Okay.

9857
06:35:18,760 --> 06:35:19,200
Okay.

9858
06:35:19,380 --> 06:35:19,820
Okay.

9859
06:35:19,920 --> 06:35:20,300
Okay.

9860
06:35:20,380 --> 06:35:21,000
This is it.

9861
06:35:21,060 --> 06:35:21,880
This is it.

9862
06:35:22,000 --> 06:35:22,380
Here.

9863
06:35:22,640 --> 06:35:23,020

Here!

9871
06:35:35,730 --> 06:35:36,150
Almost there!

9872
06:35:36,450 --> 06:35:37,770
We're doing it, Ashley!

9873
06:35:37,930 --> 06:35:39,390
The power of back seating!

9874
06:35:40,110 --> 06:35:40,830
Where?

9875
06:35:41,070 --> 06:35:41,850
Oh, here!

9876
06:35:45,670 --> 06:35:47,010
Let me out!

9877
06:35:48,950 --> 06:35:50,530
Oh my god!

9878
06:35:50,570 --> 06:35:52,270
The power of back seating!

9879
06:35:53,450 --> 06:35:54,710
Run, girl!

9880
06:35:54,810 --> 06:35:55,090
Run!

9881
06:35:55,090 --> 06:35:55,290
Run!

9882
06:35:58,980 --> 06:36:00,180
Holy fuck!

9883
06:36:00,380 --> 06:36:01,400
God damn it!

9884
06:36:04,800 --> 06:36:06,280
Oh shit, man!

9885
06:36:06,600 --> 06:36:08,620
I hate this thing!

9886
06:36:08,660 --> 06:36:10,660
I actually love all of them!

9887
06:36:14,250 --> 06:36:15,690
Oh my god!

9888
06:36:15,770 --> 06:36:16,970
I'm so happy!

9889
06:36:19,330 --> 06:36:20,190
Oh!

9890
06:36:28,200 --> 06:36:29,920
Thank god!

9891
06:36:30,180 --> 06:36:31,820
Leon, please give me your gun!

9892
06:36:32,020 --> 06:36:32,440
Leon!

9893
06:36:32,500 --> 06:36:32,740
No!

9894
06:36:32,900 --> 06:36:33,480
Ashley!

9895
06:36:33,640 --> 06:36:34,540
What happened?

9896
06:36:38,090 --> 06:36:40,420
After everything I did!

9897
06:36:44,200 --> 06:36:47,020
After everything, Ashley!

9898
06:36:52,480 --> 06:36:54,140
Oh my god!

9899
06:36:54,240 --> 06:36:57,560
He turned his back for literally two seconds!

9900
06:37:00,400 --> 06:37:02,020
Oh my god!

9901
06:37:03,420 --> 06:37:04,600
Oh my god!

9902
06:37:04,660 --> 06:37:06,180
Fucking Ashley, man!

9903
06:37:06,460 --> 06:37:07,440
Fucking Ashley!

9904
06:37:08,440 --> 06:37:09,280
Oh!

9905
06:37:10,040 --> 06:37:10,660
What the

9906
06:37:22,300 --> 06:37:24,200
fuck is... what?

9907
06:37:24,580 --> 06:37:26,080
What is that?

9908
06:37:26,080 --> 06:37:26,980
What is that?

9909
06:37:30,580 --> 06:37:32,240
That's... that's Ashley, right?

9910
06:37:32,480 --> 06:37:33,520
A for Ashley.

9911
06:37:34,420 --> 06:37:39,260
I know like Ada is supposed to be like some fucking assassin.

9912
06:37:39,580 --> 06:37:41,300
Like some robot assassin.

9913
06:37:41,700 --> 06:37:43,560
But like I don't like the voice acting.

9914
06:37:43,820 --> 06:37:45,920
Or how mechanical she sounds.

9915
06:37:48,320 --> 06:37:49,340
Is that Wesker?

9916
06:38:06,260 --> 06:38:06,560
Alright.

9917
06:38:08,880 --> 06:38:09,660
Hey Ada.

9918
06:38:10,540 --> 06:38:12,160
I just went through hell.

9919
06:38:20,220 --> 06:38:22,040
Oh god, it was...

9920
06:38:22,960 --> 06:38:24,360
It was so hard.

9921
06:38:25,000 --> 06:38:25,920
Oh my god.

9922
06:38:26,100 --> 06:38:27,240
Alright, we're calling it here.

9923
06:38:29,140 --> 06:38:35,020
I think... I honestly think this is a... this is a good place to call it.

9924
06:38:35,360 --> 06:38:36,540
I think...

9925
06:38:36,540 --> 06:38:36,540
I honestly think this is a...

9926
06:38:36,540 --> 06:38:36,540
this is a good place to call it.

9927
06:38:39,720 --> 06:38:41,000
Oh my god.

9928
06:38:41,140 --> 06:38:41,540
Oh my god.

9929
06:38:41,540 --> 06:38:41,540
Bro.

9930
06:38:41,720 --> 06:38:44,320
After... after the Ashley part, I'm done.

9931
06:38:49,280 --> 06:38:50,900
We'll finish the game.

9932
06:38:51,300 --> 06:38:55,980
We'll finish... we'll finish Resident Evil next... next week, guys.

9933
06:38:56,120 --> 06:38:58,440
We're gonna finish Resident Evil next week.

9934
06:38:59,100 --> 06:39:01,500
All it took was the Ashley level.

9935
06:39:01,600 --> 06:39:01,860
Yes.

9936
06:39:02,640 --> 06:39:03,280
100%.

9937
06:39:03,280 --> 06:39:06,540
Ashley level is what is... what makes or breaks the game.

9938
06:39:08,020 --> 06:39:10,980
The Ashley level is what ages me like...

9939
06:39:10,980 --> 06:39:12,540
I'm insane.

9940
06:39:14,920 --> 06:39:19,820
The moment we're at the Ashley level, I'm mentally checked out.

9941
06:39:19,900 --> 06:39:21,920
I'm so fucking checked out, guys.

9942
06:39:25,000 --> 06:39:25,520
Anyway.

9943
06:39:25,840 --> 06:39:27,160
I think I really lost it.

9944
06:39:27,160 --> 06:39:27,980
The chat's coming in.

9945
06:39:28,020 --> 06:39:29,400
So I'm gonna call it here, everybody.

9946
06:39:29,720 --> 06:39:31,580
I am really tired now.

9947
06:39:32,120 --> 06:39:32,640
From...

9948
06:39:32,640 --> 06:39:33,760
Like I was fine.

9949
06:39:33,980 --> 06:39:35,900
I was fine until... until Ashley.

9950
06:39:35,900 --> 06:39:38,240
Then I was not so fine anymore.

9951
06:39:39,980 --> 06:39:40,900
But yeah!

9952
06:39:41,180 --> 06:39:43,500
Also, I guess a little update.

9953
06:39:43,860 --> 06:39:44,900
A little update.

9954
06:39:45,880 --> 06:39:47,820
You guys just don't follow me on Twitter.

9955
06:39:48,160 --> 06:39:58,680
If you purchase the buttons, the pinback buttons for the Lunar New Year merch, they will be shipped out sooner than the estimated shipping date.

9956
06:39:58,800 --> 06:40:02,420
Because I have a... like those like... those like button makers.

9957
06:40:02,980 --> 06:40:04,340
And I make them myself.

9958
06:40:04,340 --> 06:40:07,980
So like... they will be shipped out soonish.

9959
06:40:08,740 --> 06:40:09,480
So yeah!

9960
06:40:09,540 --> 06:40:10,420
I look forward to that.

9961
06:40:10,680 --> 06:40:11,280
If you guys...

9962
06:40:12,180 --> 06:40:14,340
If you guys like... ordered...

9963
06:40:15,180 --> 06:40:16,240
Only for the buttons though.

9964
06:40:16,320 --> 06:40:19,260
If you ordered like other items with the buttons, they'll be shipped when the other items are there.

9965
06:40:19,440 --> 06:40:21,960
But you only ordered the buttons, then like they'll be shipped out sooner.

9966
06:40:22,200 --> 06:40:22,780
So yeah!

9967
06:40:22,860 --> 06:40:24,660
That's the only other things I have for all of you guys.

9968
06:40:25,260 --> 06:40:26,660
I'm gonna call it here, everybody.

9969
06:40:26,780 --> 06:40:30,720
I am so exhausted from fucking Ashley level.

9970
06:40:31,340 --> 06:40:33,120
I hope you guys had a great time watching.

9971
06:40:33,740 --> 06:40:39,280
As always everybody, stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

9972
06:40:39,480 --> 06:40:41,760
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

9973
06:40:41,960 --> 06:40:43,180
Cause you deserve it.

9974
06:40:43,240 --> 06:40:44,320
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

9975
06:40:44,700 --> 06:40:45,380
Bye guys!

9976
06:40:45,960 --> 06:40:46,400
Bye!
