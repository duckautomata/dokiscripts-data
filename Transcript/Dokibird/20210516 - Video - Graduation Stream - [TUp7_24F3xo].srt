00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:42,840
Hello!

2
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,680
Let's play some jazz.

3
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:45,720
Hello, hello everyone!

4
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,940
Hello!

5
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,520
The final heist!

6
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,020
The last stream!

7
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,240
I didn't want to swap scenes.

8
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,060
I just wanted to stay there forever.

9
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,680
So it will be a never ending starting stream.

10
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,060
If we never start the stream, we never end.

11
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,000
Think about that!

12
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,680
I was like, maybe let's wait a bit longer.

13
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,780
Let's wait a bit longer.

14
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,960
Oh guys, there's so many of you.

00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,120

I have never been so stressed out for a stream.

42
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,200
Because it's like I can't believe.

43
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,540
I never thought I would I would like stop a stream.

44

It's just crazy.

47
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:40,740
I am going to wake up the next week while I am on the run at a Motel 6 with my bunnies and be like I don't have to stream.

I don't have the alerts sound on just because I am going to be putting this stream up onto YouTube as an archive for all of you.

71
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:41,420
So I don't think it would be great to have like the screaming Yoshi in the background for 20 minutes straight while I am watching.

72
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,200
I am trying to talk.

73
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,460
It would be like, by the way...

74
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:45,860

Thank you everyone.

96
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:31,690
So my plan for today.

97
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:39,710
I don't want to like drag on the stream for really long because I want to make it nice and sweet for all of you.

98
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:43,770
So we are not going to be playing like 20 different games and having like a 20 hour stream.

99
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:49,930
So the current set list for the stream is we are going to do the tour.

100
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,730
The final tour of the community Minecraft server.

101
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:56,950
Um, maybe a little small karaoke request.

102
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,050
Song request.

103
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,650
Of songs I have sung before.

104
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:05,370
Cause I, okay to be I really wanted to prep prep for a karaoke set list for all of you.

105
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:15,130
But I was, my last final weeks were so packed with so many things to prepare and everything that I couldn't, I couldn't like learn new songs for you guys.

106
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:15,770
I'm so sorry.

107
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:20,890
It was like, I didn't expect us to hit so many charity goals.

108
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:21,710
Too.

109
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:24,050

00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:34,910
So I had to like, I stuffed my remaining weeks to to like prep for the streams for those.

Yeah, but I feel like it's going to be there for a while.

121

I remember I saw a comment.

138
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:26,290
What will you be doing if I'm not streaming?

139
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:27,810
Well, I'll be on the run.

140
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:33,370
Like I have to constantly move around or I'm going to get caught by the authorities.

141
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:38,710
Hahaha Also, also thank you for the three.

I honestly thought four weeks was gonna was not gonna like was gonna take a while.

149
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:53,970
But I it felt so fast.

150
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:57,590
It felt like every stream was just like an eye blink away.

151
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:58,610
It's crazy.

152
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:01,030
I never expected it to go by this fast.

153
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:02,730
There's lots of tonight.

154
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,990

Hahaha No I didn't.

157
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:12,050
I really didn't anticipate this at all.

158
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:14,270
I really didn't think you guys.

159
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:18,130
Hahaha I really thank you everyone.

160
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:23,470
I can't even say that with a straight face cause I honestly I honestly didn't expect this at all.

161
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:26,310
Cause I was like this is gonna be the final stream.

162
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:29,530
You guys don't have to give me anything any anymore guys.

163
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,290
You really don't.

164
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:35,570
Hahaha People making you all this stuff.

165
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:37,670

Hahaha Um Were the results of sending the... Oh I posted it on Twitter.

Hahaha They're like... No not instant.

170
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:54,150
It took them like three days of like looking through my application.

171
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,350
It was like is she serious?

172
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:56,870
And then I got the rejection.

173
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:59,570
Every other ones I submitted took like one to two days.

174
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:02,210
This one took me like took me like three days.

175
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,890
So they were actually a bit confused.

176
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:08,090

I will be leaving the discord.

229
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:43,430
I've decided that after much consideration I will be leaving the server.

230
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:46,370
And we'll be handing it over to someone.

231
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:49,790
Who will be... who will... the discord now is all closed.

232
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,710
So no one can get in anymore.

233
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:56,550
Um but it will... ah it will live on from you guys.

234
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:59,130
My park nights will live on in the server.

235
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,750
But I will be leaving it.

236
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:04,270

For those of you who don't know the community server.

274
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,970
It was a at first it was a single player server.

275
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,710
And where I was trying to build a hallway.

276
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:18,390
And then for the final two weeks you guys all wanted me to open it up to everyone.

277
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:24,010
So I decided to so we did a community server and I'm going to be touring around all your creations.

278
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:25,650
And then I made you guys.

279
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:28,030
It was like free labor to finish my hallway too.

280
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,710
So it was like a win-win for everyone.

281
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:32,170
You get to walk the hallway.

282
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:34,310

291

00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,260
I got the pack.

368
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,100
Alright.

369
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:53,880
I got so many people killed on the the pee pee beacon.

370
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,800
So it's basically you're like where do I go?

371
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,540
And then oh that's my shovel.

372
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,080
Hahaha.

373
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,380
Okay and then you uh you jump here.

374
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:04,400
And go.

375
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,100
Ah that's where I go.

376
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,020
And then let me dig.

377
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,040
Wow that's a skeleton.

378
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:09,840
Hahaha.

379
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,320
Let me let me head home first guys.

380
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:13,240
So.

381
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,640
Popular candy.

382
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,180
Ashima threw out some scuff.

383
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:17,940
True exactly.

384
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:19,640
Scyany.

385
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,000
I'm the devil of the ball.

386
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,720
The star of the show.

387
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:24,740
Yeah.

388
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,120
Type of pony.

389
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:26,680
Please.

390
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,000
Skeleton please.

391
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:28,920
This is my final.

392
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:29,680
Oh I almost.

393
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,400
This is my final stream.

394
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:32,160
Hahaha.

395
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:32,940
Hahaha.

396
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:34,740
Streamer.

397
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,000
Alright so.

398
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,040
What's gonna happen.

399
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,060
The Minecraft server will survive for a month.

400
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,440
And then whatever happens to it.

401
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,600
And then what happens to it is Azer's decision.

402
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,460
Alright so this is Azer's house right?

403
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:57,080
So I uh don't tell Azer cause he can't watch the stream and listen and watch the stream and listen and play Minecraft at the same time.

404
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,560
But I killed one of his bees by accident.

405
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,440
I took this flint out and I was like oh what's this?

406
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,280
And then I right clicked into the.

407
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,480
I right clicked into it.

408
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,360
Hahaha.

409
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,300
Don't tell Azer.

410
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,300
He doesn't know.

411
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,960
He doesn't know.

412
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:12,720
Hahaha.

413
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:13,820
Hahaha.

414
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,220
He doesn't know.

415
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,840
He doesn't know.

416
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:19,440
Hahaha.

417
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,360
No he doesn't.

418
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,820
He doesn't know.

419
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:23,820
Hahaha.

420
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:24,900
Hahaha.

421
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,760
Also what's this?

422
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,600
This is up.

423
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,700
And this is someone's home.

424
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,180
And this is someone's home.

425
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,500
I don't know whose home this is.

426
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,560
Oh my god.

427
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,260
I almost.

428
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,880
I should not have this out.

429
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,040
I almost lit his home on fire.

430
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,860
I almost lit his home on fire.

431
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,720
I'm sorry.

432
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,020
I almost lit it on fire.

433
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,320
Alright so.

434
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,940
Uh what's this?

435
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:54,540
What's this?

436
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,940
Where is it?

437
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,740
Where is it?

438
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,580
Oh it's here.

439
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,140
It's Ito-san.

440
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,780
What does Ito-san do?

441
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,200
Oh he restores.

442
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,840
Are you still burning my house?

443
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,700
I'm so sorry.

444
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,420
Thank you so much for the 5000 bits.

445
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,000
Thank you.

446
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,340
Thank you.

447
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,680
I really do appreciate it.

448
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,320
Thank you so much.

449
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,060
Alright so this is the tomato.

450
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,220
Uh the tomato god.

451
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,000
Which is me.

452
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:17,880
Hahaha.

453
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:19,620
That's me.

454
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,440
And that's also me.

455
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,820
Look at me with my children.

456
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,420
Before I eat them.

457
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,840
This is also me.

458
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:26,880
Hahaha.

459
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,200
This is my home.

460
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,200
Let me introduce you to my home.

461
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,100
So this is the...

462
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,700
Changes were made.

463
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:38,040
Um because my...

464
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,600
Wait where do I go?

465
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:40,340
Oh.

466
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:40,960
Hahaha.

467
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,800
Changes were made.

468
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,120
And I wasn't aware of these changes.

469
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,780
Some of these changes.

470
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:52,600
So people were getting tired of opening every door.

471
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,280
From my Minecraft house.

472
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,160
So.

473
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,340
Wait is this the hallway?

474
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,940
Oh my god.

475
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:58,460
Hahaha.

476
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,380
This is not.

477
00:23:59,460 --> 00:23:59,940
Wait.

478
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,920
Wait this is not my house.

479
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,680
This is the hallway.

480
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,200
Anyway that's the hallway.

481
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,400
Hahaha.

482
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:06,180
Hahaha.

483
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,420
I realized that that might not be my house.

484
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,480
Hahaha.

485
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,120
That might not be my house.

486
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,360
I was like that's way too many doors.

487
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,660
That's way too many.

488
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,700
Too many doors to the hallway.

489
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,440
Anyway that's the end.

490
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,020
The hallway is the...

491
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,020
Wait is this my house?

492
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:26,440
No.

493
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,900
Wait is this my...

494
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,380
Anyway this is my house.

495
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,380
This is... oh let's... uh...

496
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:35,020
Hallway is as may as well be your house.

497
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,040
Hahaha.

498
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,500
Anyway this is my house.

499
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,180
Your slime is my favorite.

500
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,060
Hahaha.

501
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,960
Oh no they're my bark knights.

502
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,360
And look.

503
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:45,600
Oh!

504
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,820
I didn't know this was here.

505
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:48,700
Look at that.

506
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,020
I sleep and watch myself while I sleep.

507
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,640
Truly I am beautiful.

508
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:53,440
Hahaha.

509
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:53,600
Hahaha.

510
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:55,460
Hahaha.

511
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:58,240
I like to watch myself while I sleep.

512
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,160
So I would be the last thing I see before I close my eyes.

513
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,880
And then there's my...

514
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,520
There's the little bark knights.

515
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,180
You guys are here with us too.

516
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:10,460
So and then this is my mind shaft as well.

517
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,300
So there's like apparently chickens.

518
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,300
There's apparently chickens.

519
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,560
Someone decided to...

520
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,120
Uh...

521
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,900
Breed some chickens in my mind shaft.

522
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,060
So...

523
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,140
I don't know where they are.

524
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,140
This is the last time.

525
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,140
The cave chickens.

526
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,400
Yes the cave chickens.

527
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,900
I don't know where they are right now.

528
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,300
But they're in here somewhere.

529
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,600
Um you're hearing them go...

530
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,260
There he goes.

531
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:34,860
They're mine.

532
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:35,900
They're cave chickens.

533
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,300
There's like little cave chickens there.

534
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,500
So this is my mind shaft.

535
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,780
And um...

536
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:44,060
I'm just slowly going towards...

537
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:44,640
We're almost there.

538
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:45,320
Don't worry.

539
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,040
We're almost there.

540
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:46,960
Don't worry guys.

541
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,160
We're almost... Don't worry guys.

542
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,360
We are here.

543
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,160
Look at that.

544
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,000
And then...

545
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:53,680
We're in the body shaft.

546
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:55,700
It's protection.

547
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,100
And then...

548
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,440
You can go this way.

549
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,940
Or this way.

550
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,060
Which is a cave.

551
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,220
We can try and find the chickens.

552
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,500
But we'll definitely won't be able to...

553
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,420
Uh...

554
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,980
We'll definitely won't be able to find our way out.

555
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:11,700
Hahahaha.

556
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,140
Hahahaha.

557
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,760
No it's extra protection every time.

558
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,520
Okay if you ever watch any zombie movie.

559
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,360
Or any like movie where there's monsters.

560
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,220
The reason why they die is that they don't close the door.

561
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,100
So this is extra protection.

562
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:26,880
You're welcome.

563
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:30,260
These doors have saved me so many times.

564
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,420
From monsters trying to get in.

565
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,480
There's no way in and no way out.

566
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,440
Just like the mystery.

567
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,920
Anyway let's...

568
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,780
Pony...

569
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:40,960
I mean pony...

570
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,780
Pony should know...

571
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:43,780
Also can one of the mon...

572
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:44,920
That's not supposed to be.

573
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,020
Can one of the mon...

574
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:47,540
Uh...

575
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,880
Link the daily song.

576
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,980
So how many doors...

577
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,660
Many trees have died for this.

578
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,700
Many many trees have died for this.

579
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,420
I'll be the toast of the town.

580
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,500
Extra protection for the mon...

581
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:06,220
Pony every pony every pony should know.

582
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:06,640
There we go.

583
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,000
And we're home.

584
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:10,460
Um...

585
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:11,760
We're home.

586
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,440
Look at that.

587
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,400
So these didn't exist before.

588
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,000
So people would just...

589
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,640
Open and close it.

590
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,880
I would just open and close it myself every time.

591
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:23,620
And then everyone got fed up with that.

592
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,060
Especially with the hallway.

593
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,580
So they built...

594
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,400
They built little like...

595
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,240
Those little like...

596
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:31,220
Thingies.

597
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,400
Alright whose house are we going next?

598
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,380
Who wants to leave me?

599
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,320
Oh there's B-man.

600
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:40,820
That was my house by the way guys.

601
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,480
And there's a little koi fish in here too.

602
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,520
There's a little koi fish in here.

603
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,080
Oh and my pool.

604
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:46,900
Let me show you my...

605
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:47,440
Diving pool.

606
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,500
Wait wait before...

607
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,700
Before we do that let me show you my...

608
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,360
Diving board.

609
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,760
So this is my first...

610
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,540
This is my first...

611
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,120
PP beacon.

612
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:59,240
Cause I... This was not my first house guys.

613
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,860
This was not my first house.

614
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,360
I had another house.

615
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,040
And then I got lost.

616
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,400
And I died.

617
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,160
So I started making...

618
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,000
The beacons to help me.

619
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,180
They were the first hallway.

620
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,140
I would like to call this...

621
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,620
The vertical hallway.

622
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,600
Also thank you Ed for the...

623
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,180
8 months at tier 3.

624
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,120
Thank you.

625
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,460
Thank you.

626
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:21,940
Thank you.

627
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,880
Thank you so much.

628
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,080
I'll do a little...

629
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:28,440
I'll do claps.

630
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,760
And then there's my flower.

631
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,460
I put this here.

632
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,880
But let's give a little...

633
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,720
Let's give a little clap.

634
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,960
Let's embark nice real quick...

635
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,400
For Ed for the 8 months at tier 3.

636
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,520
Thank you so much.

637
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,240
I really do appreciate it.

638
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:41,900
Thank you.

639
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,320
Thank you.

640
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:42,760
Thank you.

641
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:43,740
It really means a lot.

642
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:44,700
Thank you so much.

643
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,040
And then... Alright.

644
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:47,900
Sparkies.

645
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:52,140
I owe you Twitch chat more than a million dollars.

646
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:53,340
I owe you Twitch chat more than a million dollars.

647
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:53,340
Alright.

648
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:53,980
Let's go in.

649
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:54,760
Okay.

650
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,740
I need a...

651
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:58,700
Okay.

652
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,420
That was...

653
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,740
I actually didn't want to die there.

654
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,440
And then...

655
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,240
Where do I go?

656
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,120
Who's leading me?

657
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,380
Who's gonna lead me?

658
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:10,340
So...

659
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,320
I'm gonna die twice.

660
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,260
Wait.

661
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:14,860
There's a horse.

662
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:15,900
Was it my horse?

663
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:16,160
Okay.

664
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:16,740
That's Doki.

665
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:17,940
That's Doki horse.

666
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,140
He jumped in there himself.

667
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,740
Cause he has a little... He really likes cows.

668
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,320
That's the Doki horse.

669
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,080
I couldn't find a dog.

670
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,280
So a horse was just...

671
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,300
A horse is like a bigger dog.

672
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,160
That you can ride.

673
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,340
Who's this?

674
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:35,620
Whose house is this?

675
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,140
Is this your house?

676
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,040
Rancid?

677
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,000
Alright.

678
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,260
This is Rancid's house.

679
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,420
I lied.

680
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,580
It's not that cool.

681
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,480
Yes.

682
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:47,860
Oh!

683
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,260
A little bunk.

684
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:48,960
What the fuck?

685
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:49,280
Okay.

686
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,940
I thought that was a little bunk bed.

687
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:51,700
For himself.

688
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,600
A Rancid hole.

689
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,080
Alright.

690
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:55,500
What's in here?

691
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,280
Is this a mineshaft?

692
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:56,680
Alright.

693
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,220
I'm just fucking leaving the mineshaft.

694
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,120
And there's Rancid's farm.

695
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,640
That's my tomato... potato now.

696
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,120
So that was Rancid's farm.

697
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:07,600
Rancid's house.

698
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:10,920
Was there more?

699
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:11,780
Rancid?

700
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:13,560
That was just scary.

701
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,480
I wish I made it...

702
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,700
Horses are just making dogs.

703
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,900
What happened to the trees?

704
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,380
Gone are distant doors.

705
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:23,840
Alright.

706
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,440
Let's do...

707
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,460
I think I have like two more plays of this.

708
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,320
Alright.

709
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,300
Whose house am I going next guys?

710
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,320
Who's leading?

711
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,560
Did I?

712
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,520
Did I hit him?

713
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,040
I'm sorry.

714
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,960
Who's leading me?

715
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,440
Who's gonna lead me?

716
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,180
I am a sheep.

717
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,480
I don't know where to go.

718
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,040
I never looked into...

719
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,980
I don't know where...

720
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,700
Where you guys built your stuff.

721
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,720
How am I supposed to know where to go?

722
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,640
You can see the villager gulag.

723
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,920
The villager gulag?

724
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:01,940
Alright.

725
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,540
And there's me.

726
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,620
And this guy.

727
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:04,460
Whose house is that?

728
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,720
Let's go to that house.

729
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,160
Am I not running?

730
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:07,960
How do I run?

731
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,120
Wait.

732
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,340
Do I have auto sprint off?

733
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,040
Where's auto sprint?

734
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,560
Where is it?

735
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,300
Is there auto sprint?

736
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,160
I don't know how to play this game.

737
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:24,580
Please.

738
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,680
How do I run?

739
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:26,840
Am I running?

740
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,720
I'm running right?

741
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,980
Am I running?

742
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:29,560
Hahaha.

743
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:31,420
Hahaha.

744
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,640
I don't even know if I'm running.

745
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,280
Everything feels so slow.

746
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,180
Hahaha.

747
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:40,980
Alright.

748
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:41,840
You know what?

749
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,540
This is grandma.

750
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,500
Here's mine too.

751
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,620
That's mine now.

752
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,800
Whose house is this?

753
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:48,860
Hahaha.

754
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,740
I can't even take it.

755
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,300
I'm too high.

756
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,460
I stole too many things guys.

757
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,760
I stole too many things.

758
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:56,940
Hahaha.

759
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,080
Hahaha.

760
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:02,300
Oh.

761
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,920
And there's a house over here.

762
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:07,160
So you have to hold your sprint key every time you want to sprint.

763
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:07,720
Oh that's dumb.

764
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,240
Also, BOMBTASTIC!

765
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,460
Thank you for the 8 months on tier 1.

766
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,940
Let's do a little class.

767
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:18,600
Can we get some bark knights real quick for BOMBTASTIC for the 8 months at tier 1.

768
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:19,500
Thank you.

769
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:19,960
Thank you.

770
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,820
I really do appreciate it.

771
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:22,860
Thank you so much.

772
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,680
Thank you BOMBTASTIC.

773
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,680
This is the final sub.

774
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,760
Truly it is.

775
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,860
I'm the type of pony.

776
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,260
Everypony.

777
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:30,740
Everypony.

778
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:31,680
Whose house is this?

779
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,160
Oh.

780
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,320
Oh what the fuck?

781
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,060
Alright.

782
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,240
And thus I steal another.

783
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,620
I steal one thing from everyone.

784
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:44,220
I almost like ran over.

785
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,020
Well I was gonna say I almost ran over.

786
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,900
Ran over his cross but I don't really know how to run.

787
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,440
Apparently.

788
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,220
I don't know.

789
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:50,820
Hahaha.

790
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,980
Just collecting my taxes.

791
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:57,760
Just collecting my taxes real quick.

792
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,460
Oh is that the dog house?

793
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:01,740
Alright.

794
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,080
Let's check the dog house.

795
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,740
Ninja's dog house.

796
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,060
Oh!

797
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,040
It's DonkeyDodge!

798
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,160
Oh my god!

799
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,120
Hahaha.

800
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,380
I didn't expect to see that.

801
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:18,980
Oh.

802
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,600
It's okay.

803
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,000
I have Eta's sword.

804
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:26,980
Wait.

805
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:27,260
Wait.

806
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:27,940
I can't see my HP.

807
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,180
I can't see my HP!

808
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,140
Hahaha.

809
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,100
Wait.

810
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:33,540
It ran past?

811
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:34,420
Oh!

812
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,700
It's a red one!

813
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:42,020
Oh that's... Charlie thank you for three months of time!

814
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,520
Thank you!

815
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,160
What is that?

816
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:45,900
Oh my god.

817
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,680
Is this a shrine?

818
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,900
Is this a shrine?

819
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,440
For my dog?

820
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,600
Hahaha.

821
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,400
Oh my god!

822
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,660
All hell DonkeyDodge!

823
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,420
All hell.

824
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,060
Hahaha.

825
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:01,860
Look.

826
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,360
Look, dookie.

827
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,700
Look, DonkeyDodge.

828
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,580
I robbed some wheat for you.

829
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,560
I robbed some wheat for you.

830
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,200
All hell, DonkeyDodge!

831
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,220
Operating chamber!

832
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,640
What is this?

833
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,740
Left fire costume.

834
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,600
Oh that is it!

835
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:21,760
Hahaha.

836
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,140
Woo!

837
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,180
What the fuck?

838
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:25,740
Hahaha.

839
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:26,860
I got burned.

840
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,180
Woo!

841
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,580
I ran into it!

842
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:34,890
Dog is love.

843
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:35,950
Dog is life.

844
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:38,350
Alright, so that was...

845
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:39,290
Hahaha.

846
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:41,590
What are these then?

847
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:42,990
Oh is that just...

848
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:45,790
Time to work.

849
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:46,650
My taxes.

850
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:48,590
Gotta take your taxes.

851
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:50,090
Gotta collect your taxes.

852
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:51,050
Oh there's a naked sheep.

853
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:53,250
What a fascinating...

854
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:53,790
religion.

855
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:55,090
Hahaha.

856
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:55,710
Hahaha.

857
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:58,310
That was a dokey doke shrine.

858
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:01,610
I did not... I was not ready for that.

859
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:03,590
I was not ready for that.

860
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:07,570
I ran out of...

861
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:09,070
I ran out of tea guys.

862
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:11,450
Someone...

863
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:12,710
Someone give me more.

864
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:13,330
Hahaha.

865
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:14,310
Hahaha.

866
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:16,110
Someone feed me.

867
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:18,230
Alright, what's next?

868
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:21,030
Who wants to lead me to the... What?

869
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:21,930
Get back here?

870
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:22,610
Is there more?

871
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:25,290
There's more.

872
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:26,390
Oh the DJ...

873
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:27,850
The DJ bedroom.

874
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:29,430
Hahaha.

875
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:34,920
Beautiful.

876
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,320
It's truly... truly...

877
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,780
Oh it's the... it's the...

878
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,380
It's me licking Sonic toes.

879
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,900
You guys do not know what this emote is.

880
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,680
We were watching Sonic the Hedgehog.

881
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:50,160
And like the guy rendered Sonic toes very very well.

882
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,540
And then I drew this emote for my community.

883
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,580
Hahaha.

884
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:54,940
Hahaha.

885
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,220
It is beautiful.

886
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,440
Oh I can't sleep.

887
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,260
It's not day time.

888
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:00,960
Hahaha.

889
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,080
Hahaha.

890
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:04,080
Hahaha.

891
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,480
I drew that while we were watching the movie together.

892
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,840
We had like a movie night where we were watching Sonic.

893
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,240
The new Sonic movie.

894
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:15,100
And that... whoever animated Sonic's toes.

895
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:18,620
I wanna know how many hours they spent on it.

896
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,120
Cause it was way too detailed.

897
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,040
It was way too...

898
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,260
Way too...

899
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,960
Wait it's like those like...

900
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,880
What was it?

901
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,440
iCarly?

902
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:32,580
The iCarly show where the creative iCarly really really likes toes.

903
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:37,340
So people really like to take off their socks in that show.

904
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,400
I...

905
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:38,900
Hahaha.

906
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,880
I don't know if you guys really noticed that.

907
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,660
But there's a lot of shots of that there.

908
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,820
Isn't that a great final stream?

909
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,260
Me talking about...

910
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:51,640
So... this is my hallway guys.

911
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:52,820
Don't worry.

912
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,460
We will... Should we go through the hallway?

913
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:55,020
Are there any?

914
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,220
Oh let's just go through the hallway.

915
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,140
You know what?

916
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,720
We should... Wait wait no no.

917
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,880
We should look at the mountain.

918
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:00,980
The mountain.

919
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,900
So I would like to show you the mountain that sacrificed its life.

920
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,120
To... to...

921
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,200
Uh... to make the hallway.

922
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,540
So I did this.

923
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:12,340
I...

924
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:12,960
Hahaha.

925
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,320
This was half of...

926
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:18,260
This was a... This used to be a full mountain guys.

927
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,580
I made it.

928
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:20,080
Hahaha.

929
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:20,600
Hahaha.

930
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:27,280
The mountain gave it half its life for us.

931
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:28,380
So...

932
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,740
Also like I got very... I got very like stingy about it.

933
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,000
I actually like flattened it myself.

934
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:40,100
I was like mmm... And I cooked... I cooked cobblestone.

935
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,100
Uh...

936
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:41,720
To make stone.

937
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,120
So I could repair...

938
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,940
I could repair the mountain.

939
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:45,780

00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,600
Also, Jeremy, thank you so much for the rate!

1125
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:48,580
Thank you, thank you!

1126
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:49,620
I really do appreciate it.

1127
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:50,200
Also, look at this.

1128
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:50,760
This is our map.

1129
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:52,860
Oh, it shows up?

1130
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,540
You can see the hallway!

1131
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:55,800
The great hallway!

1132
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:57,760
Wait, where's the hallway?

1133
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,000
Oh, there it is!

1134
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:00,380
Look!

1135
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:02,360
Look, there it is!

1136
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,940
And then it goes underground here.

1137
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,180
And then it goes here.

1138
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:11,780
And oh my god, it's actually it's so, so expansive!

1139
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:13,440
This hallway!

1140
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:15,880
What was I thinking?

1141
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,160
Why did I do this to everyone?

1142
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:20,020
Oh yeah, okay.

1143
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,560
Okay, not gonna lie, the hallway's supposed to be a lot shorter.

1144
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:25,000
And I realized, oh, free labor!

1145
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,620
So then I made the hallway longer for everyone.

1146
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:33,680
I was like, at first it was gonna end here.

1147
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:35,380
It was gonna end here.

1148
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:38,860
And then I was like, oh, everyone's gonna be helping me out!

1149
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:41,460
So then I made it all the way here.

1150
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:49,020
Isn't that beautiful?

1151
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:50,820
It's like the land of Doki.

1152
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:53,980
Alright, Acer, lead us to the next place to go.

1153
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:57,540
I couldn't help it.

1154
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:00,800
I was like, oh my gosh, I can make this hallway longer?

1155
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,180
Because other people will work for free?

1156
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,160
Where do we go?

1157
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:11,020
Alright, the villagers through the hallway?

1158
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:12,160
Alright, let's go in!

1159
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:13,220
Let's travel!

1160
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:13,940
Let's go in!

1161
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:16,080
Oh my god, my chat!

1162
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:18,900
It's so weak!

1163
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,580
Alright, so this is the hallway.

1164
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:29,480
It takes three to four days to travel through the entire hallway.

1165
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:33,260
Like, not like actual days, but like um...

1166
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:39,780
I like how you can just hear bop bop bop bop bop bop.

1167
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,080
Like the click clack sound.

1168
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:43,140
It takes longer!

1169
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:46,000
The hallway ovens!

1170
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,260
You can't attack me!

1171
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:48,400
I'll put you in the hallway!

1172
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:50,060
I'm gonna put you in the hallway!

1173
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:51,580
Don't piss me off!

1174
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,560
It's never ending.

1175
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:59,180
This is gonna be a really long stream.

1176
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:00,980
We're almost there, guys!

1177
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:02,600
We're almost...

1178
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,060
We're almost there!

1179
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,200
Trust me!

1180
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:09,640
We're almost there!

1181
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:13,980
I saw Sazer slightly descend into insanity.

1182
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:15,760
Look, chat!

1183
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:16,760
We're going down!

1184
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,240
Clearly, we're getting closer!

1185
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:20,780
We're getting closer, guys!

1186
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:24,780
It's alright!

1187
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:26,540
Ruby, it's alright!

1188
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,880
Thank you for hanging out and dropping by, though.

1189
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:30,060
I really do appreciate it.

1190
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:30,460
Thank you!

1191
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:32,740
Wish your mom a happy birthday from me!

1192
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,140
I'm from this random stranger on the internet!

1193
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:35,480
Tell her I'm anime!

1194
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:36,160
She'll understand!

1195
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:39,080
laughter laughter laughter

1196
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:43,740
Wait, you're right!

1197
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:44,900
No, it's fine!

1198
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,920
I look behind me and I see the trail of people!

1199
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:52,020
laughter You said that and I accidentally turned too much!

1200
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:54,480
I forgot it was the right way!

1201
00:47:55,460 --> 00:48:02,300
laughter No sane person will ever be able to get in.

1202
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,040
Exactly!

1203
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:05,180
Can't break into my house!

1204
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:06,820
You gotta go through the hallway first!

1205
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:08,180
It's okay, guys!

1206
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,400
We're almost there, everyone!

1207
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,440
We're almost there!

1208
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:15,880
laughter Guys, it's okay!

1209
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:18,180
We're almost there!

1210
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,160
Two days later, we're almost there!

1211
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:21,660
Guys!

1212
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:34,260
laughter Okay, just remember that before these trap doors, before these, like, trap door thingies, we had to open and close them manually ourselves.

1213
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:38,400
And then people went crazy, so now there's these!

1214
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,040
Now there's pressure plates.

1215
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:44,280
I'm gonna find one and get to sit in a doki!

1216
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:56,260
laughter So before, yeah, so before then, people were going crazy because they kept opening, we had to open and close the doors ourselves.

1217
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,900
And people were like, Yeah!

1218
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:00,140
No!

1219
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:04,320
laughter They called pressure plates, yeah.

1220
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,040
I know.

1221
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:07,220
I know now.

1222
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:15,400
Just remember, chat, my first time I ever, like, actually played Minecraft for, like, by myself, this was the first thing I did.

1223
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:16,720
I made a hallway.

1224
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,300
And this would be the last thing I do on Minecraft.

1225
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:22,600
laughter This is the...

1226
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:25,860
laughter Many trees and rocks have died.

1227
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:28,240
Many mountains and trees have died for this.

1228
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:29,180
Wait.

1229
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:30,300
WAIT!

1230
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:31,980
There's a hole in my hallway!

1231
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:35,460
laughter Who put this hole in here?

1232
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:37,420
Who robbed my house?

1233
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:44,640
laughter There should not be any holes in this area, in this hallway.

1234
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:49,460
laughter Now this hallway is ruined.

1235
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:52,660
laughter Wait, am I going the right way?

1236
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:53,940
I should be.

1237
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:54,460
I am.

1238
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:56,100
Yeah.

1239
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:57,100
Oh, and then here, here.

1240
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:59,640
Wait, why are there more more holes?

1241
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:06,620
laughter So right here is, uh, right here is...

1242
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:08,340
Am I going the right way?

1243
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:11,000
Right here is... Wait, where am I?

1244
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,300
Wait, where does this go?

1245
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:16,320
Wait.

1246
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,580
Oh, why is... Wait, where are the...

1247
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:21,260
laughter Wait, where are the torches?

1248
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,680
Guys, where are we?

1249
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:33,220
laughter laughter laughter How did you afford all this lumber?

1250
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,860
laughter You don't have to pay for labor.

1251
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:37,360
It's okay.

1252
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:42,200
laughter laughter Why are there no torches in here, guys?

1253
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:43,700
Where are we?

1254
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,900
I think we got lost already.

1255
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:52,120
laughter laughter laughter Where are we?

1256
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:53,460
Wait, did I go backwards?

1257
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,020
Wait, is this...

1258
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:59,140
This is the right way.

1259
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:00,040
No, this is the right way.

1260
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:00,980
We just have a hole.

1261
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:03,400
There's no graduation allowed.

1262
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:09,180
laughter laughter Why did I do... No graduation allowed.

1263
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:13,300
I don't know which is the right way and which is the wrong way.

1264
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:15,360
Why are some so dark?

1265
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,520
It's like a spooky hallway now.

1266
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:18,680
Oh.

1267
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:20,200
Welcome to the...

1268
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:22,200
Someone put some torches in here.

1269
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:23,080
I don't know where to go.

1270
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:27,760
laughter laughter Where does the hallway lead?

1271
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:29,800
Ask for us to find out later.

1272
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:33,460
You just need to look and you'll get out.

1273
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:34,860
laughter I'm haunted.

1274
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,400
Oh, wait.

1275
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:37,520
This is your fault.

1276
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:42,600
laughter laughter What was that famous... wait.

1277
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:45,240
Did this just lead to a dead end?

1278
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:46,740
Wait.

1279
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:50,560
laughter Are we at a dead end?

1280
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,600
laughter Wait a minute.

1281
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:55,380
Why is there a dead end here?

1282
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:58,260
laughter laughter Oh, no.

1283
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,720
It's just we didn't open the door.

1284
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,720
We didn't open the door.

1285
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:02,240
Okay.

1286
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:05,980
laughter laughter Hey, Siri.

1287
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:07,500
Alright.

1288
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:08,260
So, wait.

1289
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:08,960
What was I gonna say?

1290
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:10,240
I forgot what I was gonna say.

1291
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:14,780
laughter laughter So, wait.

1292
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:15,400
Why is there...

1293
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,180
Why are there so many holes here?

1294
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:17,760
Poor construction.

1295
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:22,200
How dare my free laborers poorly constructed my hallway.

1296
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:23,260
I do not understand.

1297
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:25,600
laughter laughter

1298
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:31,900
The holes are taking the view.

1299
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:33,860
laughter No, that's not the point.

1300
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,260
You're supposed to go crazy.

1301
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:40,660
Not realize there's... you're supposed to think there's no outside anymore after going through my hallway.

1302
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:42,800
After going through my hallway.

1303
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:47,820
You're supposed to see that the outside doesn't exist anymore.

1304
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:49,120
It's just doors.

1305
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:53,220
I think everyone's like trying to figure out how to get out right now.

1306
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:58,000
laughter laughter Oh, shit.

1307
00:52:58,100 --> 00:52:58,340
Okay.

1308
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,400
This is a sky hallway.

1309
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:01,200
This is a sky... Oh!

1310
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:02,360
That's the quote.

1311
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:02,720
I remember.

1312
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:08,540
You didn't stop to think about... Oh, was it the scientist quote?

1313
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:10,000
The scientist quote.

1314
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:13,220
But that's... I am the scientist.

1315
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:16,220
And now we're at the sky hallway.

1316
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:18,240
You might not know this, but we're in the sky.

1317
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:21,600
This sky hallway has taken many, many lives.

1318
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:22,000
Chat.

1319
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,440
Many lives have been lost here.

1320
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:26,780
For this building.

1321
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:31,580
Because it wasn't a very smart idea to build a hallway in the sky.

1322
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:33,180
laughter laughter

1323
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,960
I love the sky hallway view.

1324
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,460
Isn't it beautiful?

1325
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:41,940
It truly is.

1326
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,800
You can almost see the clouds from up here.

1327
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:48,400
Is this the only way we can stop to think if we should?

1328
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,460
I see your spicy beans.

1329
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:53,620
Alright.

1330
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:54,220
Don't worry.

1331
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:55,180
We're almost there.

1332
00:53:57,980 --> 00:53:58,800
We're almost there.

1333
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:00,780
Based on that one horror game you played.

1334
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:02,840
And then...

1335
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:11,200
I feel so so you're definitely not claustrophobic or trapped.

1336
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:11,560
Of course!

1337
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:14,920
Many Yamashis were harmed in the building.

1338
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:16,560
Are there murder holes?

1339
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:19,820
That's for you to find out when you go in the sky hallway.

1340
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:21,560
laughter laughter

1341
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:28,320
Now we're high I don't know if you realized that but we went up some stairs.

1342
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,880
So now we're even higher up in the sky.

1343
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:39,340
laughter laughter This is the spookiest jump scare imagine this is better.

1344
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:42,360
Because you can actually go crazy in here.

1345
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:48,360
laughter laughter You walked into the great hallway of Doki Land.

1346
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:53,700
The long long hallway that takes more than three days to travel.

1347
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:55,740
There's no stairs.

1348
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:56,980
There's no alley from inside.

1349
00:54:57,140 --> 00:54:58,520
You just lose track of time.

1350
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:02,960
laughter Are we there yet?

1351
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:05,340
laughter How are you doing?

1352
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:06,020
It's been going great.

1353
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:07,080
Look there's a window now.

1354
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:09,580
Now that's the other sky hallway.

1355
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,180
laughter That's the other sky hallway.

1356
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:15,840
laughter And there was our sky hallway.

1357
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,580
Wait where am I?

1358
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:21,320
A big circle.

1359
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:27,160
laughter laughter Also Rocket thank you for the four months with Prime.

1360
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:29,100
Thank you thank you.

1361
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:32,180
Can we get some before we descend into more madness.

Ah but you see here.

1369
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:51,480
I was never seen in the first place.

1370
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:54,960
laughter How long it says.

1371
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:59,640
laughter laughter This is just torture.

Ah yes the final heist where I torture my community.

laughter

1379
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:29,420

The last day for class.

1392
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:00,180
We're outside.

1393
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:03,080
There is a door outside.

1394
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:05,940

I went to the mountain.

1402
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:25,520
It's the mountain end I made it specifically for the bee.

1403
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,240
But someone killed the bee.

1404
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:28,520
Then it wasn't me.

1405
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:30,800

laughter

1456
00:59:47,820 --> 00:59:49,340

We are almost there everyone.

1459
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:54,800
What's wrong with this?

1460
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:00,800
What's wrong with this?

1461
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:01,360
I don't understand.

1462
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:04,240
Okay, I thought these guys were gonna fuck me, put me there.

1463

This village belongs to the hallway gang.

1467
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:23,880
Someone else we kidnapped.

1468
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:28,480
This is my hall.

1469
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:30,680
This is Doki the hallway monitor.

1470
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:34,700
Alright, am I supposed to go anywhere?

1471
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:35,920
Here?

1472
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,440
Am I supposed to go inside here?

1473
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:48,760
Wait, what could my... I would have thought this was great when I...

Roy, what did you do to the villagers, Roy?

1477
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,620

Oh no!

1479
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:05,600
That's what he did to them!

1480
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:14,650
I have made them use free labor.

1481
01:01:16,870 --> 01:01:18,070
They've gone insane!

1482
01:01:18,770 --> 01:01:21,010
They've... Villagers are in captivity!

1483
01:01:25,410 --> 01:01:27,850
Oh, and now that they're reproducing here too!

1484
01:01:28,350 --> 01:01:30,250
They're making more villagers here!

1485
01:01:31,290 --> 01:01:31,950
Really?

1486
01:01:31,990 --> 01:01:33,610
They're imploring-The hallway broke them!

1487
01:01:36,710 --> 01:01:43,250
Alright This is all members of chat broken by the hallway!

1488
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:59,150
The hallway has taken another victim I see So after that so now that we saw sky hallway, let me show you Let me show you ground hallway, underground..

1489
01:01:59,150 --> 01:02:00,110
Wait, underground!

1490
01:02:00,810 --> 01:02:01,030
No way!

1491
01:02:02,650 --> 01:02:03,550
Now we're underground.

1492
01:02:04,010 --> 01:02:06,810
You might not notice this, but we're underground now.

1493
01:02:11,870 --> 01:02:14,070
Zara, thank you for gifting us up the Spoonay!

1494
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:15,170

Here, get some Park Nights real quick for you, Zara.

1498
01:02:22,950 --> 01:02:24,510
For gifting us up the Spoonay.

1499
01:02:24,590 --> 01:02:25,910
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1500
01:02:26,030 --> 01:02:28,470
It really means so much.

1501
01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:29,390
Thank you guys.

1502
01:02:29,490 --> 01:02:30,910
Thank you so much, everyone.

1503
01:02:31,310 --> 01:02:31,870
Thank you, thank you!

1504
01:02:33,490 --> 01:02:34,290
Alright, guys.

1505
01:02:34,430 --> 01:02:36,170
So, yeah, this is the underground hallway.

1506
01:02:36,530 --> 01:02:37,470
Isn't this beautiful?

1507
01:02:37,590 --> 01:02:38,610
Look, you can see...

1508
01:02:39,090 --> 01:02:39,970
some water.

1509
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:43,050
What the fuck?

1510
01:02:44,090 --> 01:02:45,830
You can see a little bit of water.

1511
01:02:49,730 --> 01:02:50,850
Isn't this beautiful?

1512
01:02:50,910 --> 01:02:52,810
And people are dying above me.

1513
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:55,230
See, look at that!

1514
01:02:55,430 --> 01:02:57,690
We're in the hallway and we don't get attacked.

1515
01:02:58,470 --> 01:02:59,850
Look at that, guys!

1516
01:03:00,310 --> 01:03:02,610
We're in the hallway and we're safe!

1517
01:03:02,970 --> 01:03:04,130
This is safe!

1518
01:03:04,390 --> 01:03:05,670
This is safe zone!

1519
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,330
This is a safe place!

1520
01:03:10,630 --> 01:03:13,490
I'm convinced the outside doesn't exist.

1521
01:03:14,150 --> 01:03:23,770
And now, not only do we have two hallways in the sky, we have three hallways in the sky!

1522
01:03:24,990 --> 01:03:28,170
We are on hallway sky number three!

1523
01:03:29,230 --> 01:03:30,270
A tree clip!

1524
01:03:34,870 --> 01:03:41,310
I realized there was really no point in making a hallway in the sky only because we can't even see the sky.

1525
01:03:43,270 --> 01:03:46,350
But hey, many died for building this.

1526
01:03:46,450 --> 01:03:50,110
Many lost experience points for this build.

1527
01:03:51,830 --> 01:03:56,910
Homicide, thank you so much for gifting a sub to the side machine.

1528
01:03:57,090 --> 01:03:57,930
Thank you, thank you!

1529
01:03:58,470 --> 01:04:00,070
Yabu is seriously slain by a zombie!

1530
01:04:00,610 --> 01:04:01,950
Thank you so much!

1531
01:04:02,010 --> 01:04:03,090
Can we get some more bark knights?

1532
01:04:03,670 --> 01:04:07,690
Real quick, for homicide, for gifting a sub to the side machine.

1533
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:08,530
Thank you, thank you!

1534
01:04:08,570 --> 01:04:09,090
Thank you!

1535
01:04:09,190 --> 01:04:10,830
Thank you so much everyone!

1536
01:04:11,170 --> 01:04:11,970
Thank you guys!

1537
01:04:12,250 --> 01:04:12,950
Thank you!

1538
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:15,850
Alright, let's go to...

1539
01:04:15,850 --> 01:04:17,290
Oh, it's raining, but we don't know that.

1540
01:04:17,350 --> 01:04:18,030
We're in a hallway.

1541
01:04:18,710 --> 01:04:19,970
We're almost there, guys!

1542
01:04:21,530 --> 01:04:23,830
I'm positive we're almost there now.

1543
01:04:24,070 --> 01:04:24,870
This is it!

1544
01:04:25,030 --> 01:04:26,010
This is the run!

1545
01:04:26,430 --> 01:04:27,310
Where am I?

1546
01:04:27,670 --> 01:04:28,450
Is this the end?

1547
01:04:28,470 --> 01:04:29,810
Is this the underground?

1548
01:04:32,130 --> 01:04:33,710
Oh, I'm going crazy?

1549
01:04:33,710 --> 01:04:34,570
Am I hearing voices?

1550
01:04:34,850 --> 01:04:35,290
That's...

1551
01:04:38,010 --> 01:04:41,270
When I heard voices, I was like what was that?

1552
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:43,510
Am I actually going crazy now?

1553
01:04:48,230 --> 01:04:49,590
We're almost there, guys!

1554
01:04:49,850 --> 01:04:50,610
For sure!

1555
01:04:52,270 --> 01:04:53,450
We're definitely there!

1556
01:04:56,390 --> 01:04:58,850
So you probably were like Oh, thank you, Rocket!

1557
01:04:58,850 --> 01:05:00,450
That's really sweet, Rocket!

1558
01:05:00,710 --> 01:05:02,030
Since I don't graduate!

1559
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:07,210
Alright, it's time for me to...

1560
01:05:07,210 --> 01:05:09,130
Okay, let me get the sub to you guys.

1561
01:05:09,270 --> 01:05:10,710
I've never done this before.

1562
01:05:10,870 --> 01:05:12,570
Oh, that's really sweet, Ruby!

1563
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:19,170
I've never gifted a sub to my own stream because no one has ever redeemed this before.

1564
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:20,410
But I will...

1565
01:05:20,410 --> 01:05:21,990
But I will do it.

1566
01:05:22,130 --> 01:05:23,390
Alright, should we...

1567
01:05:23,450 --> 01:05:26,950
I'll do like a gift... a sub.

1568
01:05:27,450 --> 01:05:28,850
Gift one sub.

1569
01:05:29,530 --> 01:05:30,870
Alright, here we go.

1570
01:05:32,570 --> 01:05:33,710
I'm doing it!

1571
01:05:33,890 --> 01:05:34,950
Who's gonna get it?

1572
01:05:34,990 --> 01:05:36,050
Who's gonna get the sub?

1573
01:05:37,170 --> 01:05:38,790
Congratulations, Vic!

1574
01:05:39,130 --> 01:05:39,710
Congratulations!

1575
01:05:40,330 --> 01:05:43,270
Can we get some Barth Knights real quick?

1576
01:05:43,430 --> 01:05:44,270
For myself?

1577
01:05:47,810 --> 01:05:49,150
For myself!

1578
01:05:49,510 --> 01:05:50,190
Please!

1579
01:05:50,610 --> 01:05:51,910
Barth Knights for me!

1580
01:05:55,490 --> 01:05:56,730
Thank you, thank you!

1581
01:05:57,030 --> 01:05:57,910
Thank you, thank you!

1582
01:05:57,910 --> 01:05:59,210
Thank you, Mia, for gifting a sub!

1583
01:05:59,310 --> 01:06:00,030
No problem!

1584
01:06:04,290 --> 01:06:05,730
Alright, where was I?

1585
01:06:05,950 --> 01:06:07,170
Is this the right area?

1586
01:06:07,310 --> 01:06:08,130
It's here, right?

1587
01:06:08,410 --> 01:06:09,070
Which way?

1588
01:06:09,510 --> 01:06:11,090
Which way do I go, Ocelot?

1589
01:06:11,170 --> 01:06:11,690
I'm lost!

1590
01:06:11,990 --> 01:06:13,390
Which way, Ocelot?

1591
01:06:14,630 --> 01:06:16,450
Which way did I get lost?

1592
01:06:17,770 --> 01:06:18,250
Alright!

1593
01:06:19,130 --> 01:06:20,690
Alright, another gifted sub.

1594
01:06:20,690 --> 01:06:22,130
Into the world it goes!

1595
01:06:22,950 --> 01:06:24,930
Another one bites the dust!

1596
01:06:27,230 --> 01:06:28,130
Oh, two!

1597
01:06:28,650 --> 01:06:29,830
Alright, alright.

1598
01:06:29,950 --> 01:06:30,830
Who gets this one?

1599
01:06:31,730 --> 01:06:32,410
Envy!

1600
01:06:32,570 --> 01:06:33,250
Congratulations!

1601
01:06:34,050 --> 01:06:35,690
Another gifted sub, everyone.

1602
01:06:35,770 --> 01:06:36,670
Another one.

1603
01:06:36,930 --> 01:06:37,850
Another one.

1604
01:06:39,510 --> 01:06:44,630
Alright, can we get some Barth Knights real quick for me again?

1605
01:06:46,990 --> 01:06:48,710
For me again?

1606
01:06:48,910 --> 01:06:49,670
Thank you!

1607
01:06:53,330 --> 01:06:54,630
For Shire Rose!

1608
01:06:54,730 --> 01:06:56,110
Thank you, thank you!

1609
01:06:56,670 --> 01:06:57,690
Thank you to me!

1610
01:06:58,010 --> 01:07:01,550
And I guess Roy and Ruby for redeeming those!

1611
01:07:03,610 --> 01:07:04,690
Thank you, everyone!

1612
01:07:05,030 --> 01:07:05,930
Thank you, thank you!

1613
01:07:06,050 --> 01:07:06,730
And thank you, me!

1614
01:07:09,270 --> 01:07:10,530
Alright, where do we go?

1615
01:07:10,870 --> 01:07:11,630
Is it here?

1616
01:07:11,970 --> 01:07:13,090
Is this the right way?

1617
01:07:13,590 --> 01:07:14,930
Okay, this is the right way.

1618
01:07:15,350 --> 01:07:18,270
I lost track of all these gifted...

1619
01:07:18,270 --> 01:07:20,110
We've all won all the gifted subs.

1620
01:07:21,950 --> 01:07:22,610
Look!

1621
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:24,810
There's a fourth sky hallway?

1622
01:07:25,810 --> 01:07:27,450
I didn't even remember!

1623
01:07:27,980 --> 01:07:29,450
That there was a fourth one!

1624
01:07:29,790 --> 01:07:32,590
But now there's a fourth sky hallway!

1625
01:07:34,610 --> 01:07:40,250
There were so many so many hallways, I've forgotten how many there were in the end.

1626
01:07:40,770 --> 01:07:42,090
And then...

1627
01:07:45,030 --> 01:07:46,150
And then...

1628
01:07:46,150 --> 01:07:47,290
Here we go.

1629
01:07:48,270 --> 01:07:49,630
Here, we're almost there.

1630
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:51,950
I swear, guys, we're almost there.

1631
01:07:52,350 --> 01:07:54,230
We're almost there now.

1632
01:07:54,390 --> 01:07:55,950
For reals now, guys.

1633
01:07:56,090 --> 01:07:56,810
For real.

1634
01:07:57,990 --> 01:07:58,930
This is it!

1635
01:07:59,550 --> 01:08:00,510
This is it!

1636
01:08:04,270 --> 01:08:06,090
This is it, guys!

1637
01:08:06,270 --> 01:08:07,710
The final frontier!

1638
01:08:10,170 --> 01:08:11,230
This is it!

1639
01:08:11,970 --> 01:08:13,010
This is it!

1640
01:08:14,010 --> 01:08:16,150
No, I'm sure... and we're here!

1641
01:08:16,590 --> 01:08:18,110
And you're back where you started.

1642
01:08:18,270 --> 01:08:18,750
Hahaha!

1643
01:08:20,710 --> 01:08:20,890
Hahaha!

1644
01:08:22,390 --> 01:08:22,930
Hahaha!

1645
01:08:23,870 --> 01:08:24,410
Hahaha!

1646
01:08:25,950 --> 01:08:28,350
This was my plan all along.

1647
01:08:28,790 --> 01:08:30,130
To make the whole...

1648
01:08:30,130 --> 01:08:34,950
So whenever someone spawns in, they'll be like, this is the right way to go, right?

1649
01:08:35,150 --> 01:08:37,050
And then they go through madness.

1650
01:08:37,470 --> 01:08:39,130
Am I going through this hallway?

1651
01:08:40,070 --> 01:08:47,430
Any new players that come in and they're like, oh, there's two doors here!

1652
01:08:47,630 --> 01:08:48,870
Do I go through here?

1653
01:08:49,050 --> 01:08:51,070
Or do I climb up?

1654
01:08:51,370 --> 01:08:54,390
And if they choose here, then they just go insane.

1655
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:56,010
Then they just go...

1656
01:08:56,010 --> 01:08:56,550
Hahaha!

1657
01:08:58,750 --> 01:09:00,590
Then they just go insane.

1658
01:09:01,150 --> 01:09:04,130
And all I see is hell in one hallway.

1659
01:09:04,490 --> 01:09:04,970
Hahaha!

1660
01:09:05,610 --> 01:09:06,650
Rancid's been lost.

1661
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:08,510
We lost someone in the hallway.

1662
01:09:08,790 --> 01:09:10,290
We've lost Rancid.

1663
01:09:10,370 --> 01:09:11,390
Can we get some...

1664
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:14,290
Can we get some F's in chat for Rancid?

1665
01:09:15,070 --> 01:09:15,650
Hahaha!

1666
01:09:15,650 --> 01:09:17,390
Rancid can't go back!

1667
01:09:17,630 --> 01:09:18,030
Hahaha!

1668
01:09:19,150 --> 01:09:21,430
Rancid has been lost in the hallway.

1669
01:09:21,830 --> 01:09:23,370
We don't know where he...

1670
01:09:23,370 --> 01:09:25,230
We have lost him!

1671
01:09:25,470 --> 01:09:26,570
Where is he?

1672
01:09:26,710 --> 01:09:27,750
Where did he go?

1673
01:09:27,910 --> 01:09:30,030
I don't even see his name anymore.

1674
01:09:30,410 --> 01:09:31,290
I think...

1675
01:09:31,290 --> 01:09:31,970
Hahaha!

1676
01:09:33,810 --> 01:09:36,110
Not everyone makes it out.

1677
01:09:36,390 --> 01:09:37,210
I mean...

1678
01:09:37,210 --> 01:09:37,750
Hahaha!

1679
01:09:41,090 --> 01:09:45,400
Not everyone can make it out in the... make it out of the hallway.

1680
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:46,320
Hahaha!

1681
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:47,720
Hahaha!

1682
01:09:48,580 --> 01:09:49,960
They're just gone.

1683
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:50,680
Look down.

1684
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:52,280
Is Rancid out?

1685
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:52,780
RANCID!

1686
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:53,760
He's out!

1687
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:54,760
He missed...

1688
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:55,840
He didn't!

1689
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:56,900
He didn't!

1690
01:09:57,080 --> 01:09:57,660
Hahaha!

1691
01:09:58,440 --> 01:09:59,860
We spoke too soon.

1692
01:09:59,860 --> 01:10:00,260
He survived.

1693
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:01,200
Hahaha!

1694
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:03,100
But at what cost?

1695
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:05,240
At what cost, guys?

1696
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:05,980
Hahaha!

1697
01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:07,040
At what cost?

1698
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:07,660
Hahaha!

1699
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:11,400
He's not the same ever since he got lost in the hallway.

1700
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:13,620
He hasn't been the same again.

1701
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:14,720
Hahaha!

1702
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:15,720
Hahaha!

1703
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:17,620
Hahaha!

1704
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:19,700
Oh my gosh, Ruby.

1705
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:20,700
Please!

1706
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:22,300
Hahaha!

1707
01:10:23,780 --> 01:10:24,260
Hahaha!

1708
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:25,440
Was this all the...

1709
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,380
Was this all the... everything at the server?

1710
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:30,300
Not blocking out the hallway.

1711
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:31,300
What can escape?

1712
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:33,860
Was this everything at the server, Acer?

1713
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:34,620
Is there more?

1714
01:10:37,660 --> 01:10:38,560
Was there more?

1715
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:41,920
I don't know if there's any more.

1716
01:10:42,020 --> 01:10:44,240
Because like I said, I don't really know what you guys made here.

1717
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,920
Other than um... um...

1718
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:49,820
bits and pieces I saw while I was constructing the hallway.

1719
01:10:50,260 --> 01:10:54,900
Oh yeah, I love how like everyone else's like builds are so much nicer than mine.

1720
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:57,180
Like I just have this.

1721
01:10:57,460 --> 01:10:58,680
I just have this.

1722
01:10:59,040 --> 01:10:59,600
Hahaha!

1723
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:00,680
Hahaha!

1724
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:03,960
Wait, Sloth!

1725
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:06,360
Was that your house in the middle of nowhere?

1726
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:11,780
Like, was that your house all the way like in the mountains next to this this hallway?

1727
01:11:12,020 --> 01:11:13,500
Next to hallway number four?

1728
01:11:13,940 --> 01:11:15,000
Was that yours?

1729
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:16,760
Hahaha!

1730
01:11:17,300 --> 01:11:19,620
I found a... there's a house like right here!

1731
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:22,420
Hahaha!

1732
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:30,520
I found a random house in the mountains while I was... I don't know who the deranged man was.

1733
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:31,840
Hahaha!

1734
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:38,200
It took 30 minutes to... Oh, it took 30 minutes to walk you guys.

1735
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:39,480
This was a...

1736
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:42,040
This was a fucking 30 minute hallway.

1737
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:42,920
Hahaha!

1738
01:11:43,820 --> 01:11:44,800
Hey, Acer!

1739
01:11:45,380 --> 01:11:46,540
Oh, that's crazy.

1740
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:48,100
I can't believe...

1741
01:11:48,740 --> 01:11:49,720
Oh, that's yours?

1742
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:50,620
Alright, let's go to...

1743
01:11:50,620 --> 01:11:51,340
Let's go to...

1744
01:11:52,780 --> 01:11:55,060
Let's go to Elsa... Not Elsa.

1745
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:55,420
Hahaha!

1746
01:11:57,680 --> 01:11:59,300
Dragon's... Dragon's house.

1747
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:00,460
Yeah, so...

1748
01:12:00,460 --> 01:12:03,880
What you guys don't know, I'll show you a little secret in Dragon's house.

1749
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:06,880
So let me get there and I'll show you this little secret.

1750
01:12:07,140 --> 01:12:10,360

01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:11,100
Hahaha!

1752
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:18,120
Alright, so you guys are looking and we go... You can have your own little tour to the hallway if you want.

1753
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:18,820
Hahaha!

1754
01:12:18,820 --> 01:12:19,660
Oh shit!

1755
01:12:19,700 --> 01:12:20,120
I'm sorry!

1756
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:20,860
Hahaha!

1757
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:22,200
Yoink!

1758
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:22,940

Hahaha!

1766
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:31,620
It was an accident.

1767
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:33,260
It was an accident.

1768
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:34,980
I just wanted to get up easier.

1769
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:37,780
Okay, so let me show you a little secret.

1770
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:38,840
Um...

1771
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:39,500
With...

1772
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:43,180
Um... With Dragon's house.

1773
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:44,840
And it's very interesting.

1774
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:46,540
Look at this doll... door hallway.

1775
01:12:46,740 --> 01:12:47,540
Truly beautiful.

1776
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:49,500
Truly a sight to behold.

1777
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:53,360
Alright, so this little secret that I'm gonna show you guys.

1778
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:54,720
Oh my gosh!

1779
01:12:54,740 --> 01:12:56,420
Why are people talking in this song?

1780
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:57,320
Hahaha!

1781
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:58,140
Hahaha!

1782
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:01,300
Alright.

01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:02,200
Boop!

1785
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:02,820
This is good.

01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:03,840
Uh...

1787
01:13:04,660 --> 01:13:05,560
A doorway?

1788
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:07,500
Oh, so it's just this.

1789
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:09,160
Alright, let me show you a little secret.

1790
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:10,960

So... Oh, what's this first?

1792
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:14,860
What's this?

1793
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:17,160
Oh, more stuff I can steal.

1794
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:19,440
Tax time!

1795
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:20,720
Hahaha!

1796
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:22,840
Hahaha!

1797
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:23,380
Hahaha!

1798
01:13:23,540 --> 01:13:23,960
Hahaha!

1799
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:24,300

Alright, so this little secret that I'll show you guys really quick is that if you...

01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:33,240
Where is it?

1803
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:34,940
I'm trying to remember where it is.

1804
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:37,940
Where this... Where this little secret is.

1805
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:38,660
Hahaha!

1806
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:39,440
Hahaha!

1807
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:41,160
Wait, what's this?

1808
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:42,760
Oh, this was not the secret.

1809
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:44,100
But that was interesting.

1810
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:44,760
Alright.

1811
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:46,080
I'm trying to find the secret.

1812
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:47,660
There's a secret here.

1813
01:13:47,740 --> 01:13:48,440
I swear, guys!

1814
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:50,340
There's a secret here that I made!

1815
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:51,400
On accident.

1816
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:51,980
Hahaha!

1817
01:13:51,980 --> 01:13:53,000
Oh my god, Michael!

1818
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:54,780
Alright.

1819
01:13:55,980 --> 01:13:57,280
Where is this secret?

1820
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:58,340
Oh, it's here.

1821
01:13:58,440 --> 01:13:58,780
It's here.

1822
01:13:58,880 --> 01:13:59,480
It's here.

1823
01:13:59,520 --> 01:13:59,960
Trust me.

1824
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:00,660
Trust me.

1825
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:01,420
We're gonna find it.

1826
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:03,060
We're gonna find it.

1827
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:05,200
Wait, where is it?

1828
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:05,540
No!

1829
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:07,600
I don't know where I put it!

1830
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:09,640
Oh, it's here!

1831
01:14:09,940 --> 01:14:10,620
It's here!

1832
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:13,400
It's here!

1833
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:13,400
It's here!

1834
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:14,500
This is my secret!

1835
01:14:15,180 --> 01:14:15,440
Hahaha!

1836
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:18,680
Hahaha!

1837
01:14:19,220 --> 01:14:19,280
Hahaha!

1838
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:20,440
Hahaha!

1839
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:24,800
This is my little... little hole.

1840
01:14:24,940 --> 01:14:26,900
Little hole behind his house.

1841
01:14:27,180 --> 01:14:27,780
Hahaha!

1842
01:14:28,340 --> 01:14:30,860
I accidentally mined into...

1843
01:14:30,860 --> 01:14:33,400
I accidentally mined into Dragon's house.

1844
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:37,520
I didn't realize I was gathering more material for...

1845
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:40,480
I was gathering...

1846
01:14:40,620 --> 01:14:46,000
more material for the hallway and I accidentally mined into Dragon's house.

1847
01:14:46,220 --> 01:14:47,960
I was like, what is this?

1848
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:50,180
Also, I blew up one of his chests too.

1849
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:51,200
Hahaha!

1850
01:14:52,740 --> 01:14:54,180
That's the other secret.

1851
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:56,360
I blew up one of his chests.

1852
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:57,240
Hahaha!

1853
01:14:58,080 --> 01:14:59,660
On a... by accident.

1854
01:14:59,860 --> 01:15:01,200
When, um...

1855
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:04,840
When a creeper showed up next to me.

1856
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:05,600
But it's okay.

1857
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:06,500
I put everything back.

1858
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:08,300
I put everything back.

1859
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:09,320
Do not worry, Dragon.

1860
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:10,040
Everything...

1861
01:15:10,620 --> 01:15:11,760
Everything was back.

1862
01:15:12,020 --> 01:15:13,080
I put it back.

1863
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:13,820
Hahaha!

1864
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:16,400
So technically...

1865
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:17,180
We all...

1866
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:18,960
We all arrived at his house.

1867
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:19,980
Hahaha!

1868
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:21,380
Hahaha!

1869
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:24,320
And so you didn't lose anything, no?

1870
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:25,620
You didn't lose anything.

1871
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:26,840
Hahaha!

1872
01:15:31,540 --> 01:15:32,060
Alright.

1873
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:33,060
Oh shit.

1874
01:15:33,140 --> 01:15:33,660
Alright, Michael.

1875
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:36,480
Let me hydrate real quick and I'll do the Michael review.

1876
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:40,020
Okay.

1877
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:40,420
Okay.

1878
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:41,200
Here's another secret.

1879
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:44,120
Uh, he had cobblestone in one of his chests.

1880
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:47,580
And I might have taken some for the whole way.

1881
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:48,240
Hahaha!

1882
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:51,380
I was like, who lives here?

1883
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:52,240
What a freak!

1884
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:53,560
Oh, he has cobblestone.

1885
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:54,820
Mine now.

1886
01:15:54,860 --> 01:15:55,360
Hahaha!

1887
01:15:55,820 --> 01:15:57,600
That's the only thing I took though.

1888
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:59,800
That was the only thing I took.

1889
01:16:00,020 --> 01:16:00,960
That was...

1890
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:03,620
I didn't want to mine more.

1891
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:05,120
I was tired of mining.

1892
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:09,720
I was just like, look at these cobblestones I found on the ground.

1893
01:16:10,380 --> 01:16:11,400
Look at that.

1894
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:13,040
I found... Hahaha!

1895
01:16:13,820 --> 01:16:13,940
Hahaha!

1896
01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:19,480
Look at... Look at these cobblestones I found on the...

1897
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:20,460
on the ground.

1898
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:21,980
Wooo!

1899
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:23,040
Hahaha!

1900
01:16:23,980 --> 01:16:24,180
Hahaha!

1901
01:16:25,940 --> 01:16:27,260
Oh my gosh.

1902
01:16:27,540 --> 01:16:28,440
Okay, alright.

1903
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:28,960
Let me...

1904
01:16:29,740 --> 01:16:30,760
Let me do the Michael review.

1905
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:40,780
I'll eat a toast of the toast, the hosannacle I'm the type of toast, I ain't toast, I ain't toast, should not eat a toast.

1906
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:42,320
Watch the toast in the flow.

1907
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:46,300
I'm the type of toast every pony, every pony should know.

1908
01:16:46,460 --> 01:16:48,460
I'll be the toast of the toast.

1909
01:16:48,620 --> 01:16:50,200
The toast on the toast.

1910
01:16:50,420 --> 01:16:51,920
The toast on the toast.

1911
01:16:52,260 --> 01:16:53,580
I'm the... I'm lost.

1912
01:16:53,660 --> 01:16:54,460
I'm lost.

1913
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:55,180
I'm lost.

1914
01:16:55,740 --> 01:16:57,460
I am so lost.

1915
01:16:57,940 --> 01:16:58,060
Hahaha!

1916
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:03,020
I'm the type of toast, every toast, every toast should know.

1917
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:05,620
And I'll be the one to watch the toast in the flow.

1918
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:14,140
I'm the type of toast, every toast, Toast, every toast should know becoming as popular as popular as toast can be.

1919
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:16,340
Making my toast, making my toast.

1920
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:19,100
Alright, oh my gosh, I actually went insane there.

1921
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:22,100
I think that fucked me up more than the whole way.

1922
01:17:22,660 --> 01:17:24,400
Alright, let's end the tour!

1923
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:26,320
Yeah, fuck you.

1924
01:17:28,340 --> 01:17:29,740
How are we ending the tour?

1925
01:17:29,940 --> 01:17:30,240
Ah!

1926
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:38,860
Oh, nope, no we're not ending with that.

1927
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:39,900
How are we ending it?

1928
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:44,360
What?

1929
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:47,700
I simply shift too fast.

1930
01:17:55,690 --> 01:17:56,950
The egg is sad?

1931
01:17:57,230 --> 01:17:58,210
Why you sad, egg?

1932
01:17:59,730 --> 01:18:01,210
Why does it keep stopping?

1933
01:18:06,310 --> 01:18:07,250
This is my house now.

1934
01:18:09,710 --> 01:18:10,550
Look at that!

1935
01:18:10,710 --> 01:18:11,470
I'm safe!

1936
01:18:11,890 --> 01:18:12,950
Because of doors?

1937
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:21,800
I don't need this.

1938
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:23,500
Alright, is that it?

1939
01:18:24,020 --> 01:18:26,480
Is that how we end the tour, everyone?

1940
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:30,460
Any final messages from my Minecraft tour?

1941
01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:33,180
My way through the hallway?

1942
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:35,620
Oh shit, Acer, can you TP Ruby?

1943
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:38,280
That's Ruby, right?

1944
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:39,220
TP!

1945
01:18:46,310 --> 01:18:47,350
TP eggalore!

1946
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:50,030
The Doki squad, woo!

1947
01:18:50,770 --> 01:18:53,790
This stream will never end, we're gonna be stuck in Minecraft forever.

1948
01:18:55,010 --> 01:18:59,170
We will be stuck here forever.

1949
01:19:00,570 --> 01:19:04,650
Alright guys, that was a great... a group photo?

1950
01:19:04,910 --> 01:19:06,550
Oh shit, yes, let's have a group photo!

1951
01:19:06,930 --> 01:19:08,210
Where should we have our group photo?

1952
01:19:08,710 --> 01:19:11,090
Let's have it... let's have it here!

1953
01:19:11,250 --> 01:19:12,230
So we can see the hallway!

1954
01:19:12,230 --> 01:19:13,830
We can see part of the sky hallway!

1955
01:19:14,210 --> 01:19:15,010
Let's have it...

1956
01:19:15,010 --> 01:19:16,230
Or next to Toma... no no!

1957
01:19:16,390 --> 01:19:17,030
Next to tomato!

1958
01:19:17,310 --> 01:19:18,070
Let's go to the tomato!

1959
01:19:18,550 --> 01:19:19,710
Let's go to the tomato!

1960
01:19:21,730 --> 01:19:23,050
Let's go to the tomato!

1961
01:19:23,450 --> 01:19:25,570
Let's all go to the mall today!

1962
01:19:25,930 --> 01:19:26,910
Also there's this.

1963
01:19:28,670 --> 01:19:30,230
What is that hot bar?

1964
01:19:30,710 --> 01:19:32,090
Let's all go to the tomato!

1965
01:19:34,670 --> 01:19:35,910
Someone's gonna die here.

1966
01:19:39,210 --> 01:19:41,510
We're gonna have the final group photo.

1967
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:43,970
And then we're gonna do a little song request.

1968
01:19:44,290 --> 01:19:47,410
I feel like someone's gonna die here and it's not gonna be me.

1969
01:19:47,970 --> 01:19:49,950
Why did we all have that tomato?

1970
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:59,020
Let's fight the ender dragon.

1971
01:20:01,700 --> 01:20:06,500
And then after that we're gonna do like a very very short karaoke song.

1972
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:07,920
Of songs I've sung before.

1973
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:12,440
Cause I am so sorry I haven't been able to prep like any new songs for you guys.

1974
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:15,160
Cause I was just so busy with my work.

1975
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:16,580
And I was just so busy with prepping everything for all of you.

1976
01:20:19,300 --> 01:20:20,860
And then here it is.

1977
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:23,720
Alright so that means we gotta go...

1978
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:24,800
Here!

1979
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:25,880
For the photo.

1980
01:20:26,060 --> 01:20:26,560
Woah woah!

1981
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:27,500
Woah woah!

1982
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:28,700
Woah woah woah!

1983
01:20:28,980 --> 01:20:29,500
Woah!

1984
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:31,660
What?

1985
01:20:36,740 --> 01:20:39,440
Why am I

1986
01:20:47,050 --> 01:20:47,430
here?

1987
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:51,960
Why?

1988
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:54,200
And you...

1989
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:55,800
You teleported everything!

1990
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:57,570
My house!

1991
01:20:57,860 --> 01:20:58,650
My town!

1992
01:21:01,990 --> 01:21:03,060
My town!

1993
01:21:05,870 --> 01:21:08,400
Our beautiful town!

1994
01:21:11,130 --> 01:21:13,620
It's okay the tomato is still alive!

1995
01:21:19,070 --> 01:21:20,680
Oh my God!

1996
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:21,980
It's okay!

1997
01:21:22,260 --> 01:21:24,300
The tomato is still there!

1998
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:29,340
It's okay!

1999
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:30,160
Alright.

2000
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:31,280
Okay.

2001
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:33,200
Other than the creeper right there.

2002
01:21:38,180 --> 01:21:40,520
Look at all this stuff.

2003
01:21:40,740 --> 01:21:44,980
Not the group photo we wanted, but it's the group photo we deserve.

2004
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:46,560
What is this?!

2005
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:47,220
Okay.

2006
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:48,660
Oh my god!

2007
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:51,080
Why did you TP me here, Acer?!

2008
01:21:52,060 --> 01:21:54,540
Acer, you flaked this creeper's ear!

2009
01:21:58,820 --> 01:22:00,360
Oh my god!

2010
01:22:02,380 --> 01:22:03,520
We're all scattered!

2011
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:05,860
Look at all of us scattered!

2012
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:10,700
We're like, we're just fucking running to the hallway!

2013
01:22:10,980 --> 01:22:13,400
To the hallway if you want to live!

2014
01:22:13,860 --> 01:22:15,320
To the hallway!

2015
01:22:17,940 --> 01:22:20,900
To the hallway if you want to live!

2016
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:21,480
Everyone!

2017
01:22:26,300 --> 01:22:27,600
Wait, where's the hallway?

2018
01:22:27,940 --> 01:22:29,860
Wait, I lost it so many...

2019
01:22:29,860 --> 01:22:30,300
Oh!

2020
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:31,460
It's okay!

2021
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:34,960
This is what the hallway was for!

2022
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:37,300
This is what it was for!

2023
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:42,760
The hallway was built for this exact situation!

2024
01:22:45,260 --> 01:22:49,080
Anyway, let's take a... let's take a photo of the...

2025
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:50,520
Hey, Machika!

2026
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:52,420
Alright, let's take a photo of the...

2027
01:22:52,420 --> 01:22:52,420
Hey, Machika!

2028
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:55,280

The Enderman!

2050
01:23:22,660 --> 01:23:24,480
Just don't look at the Enderman!

2051
01:23:28,260 --> 01:23:30,660
Just don't look at the Enderman and we'll be fine!

2052
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:33,860
Are we good?

2053
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:34,720
Just don't look at him!

2054
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:36,920
Please!

2055
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:37,540
I can't!

2056
01:23:37,620 --> 01:23:38,360
Please stop!

2057
01:23:46,330 --> 01:23:47,550
I looked at him!

2058
01:23:47,610 --> 01:23:48,190
Save me!

2059
01:23:53,250 --> 01:23:55,570
I hit the one thing I wasn't...

2060
01:23:55,570 --> 01:23:56,010
Please!

2061
01:23:56,170 --> 01:23:57,110
Save me!

2062
01:23:58,230 --> 01:23:58,790
Please!

2063
01:23:58,790 --> 01:23:59,350
Please!

2064
01:23:59,470 --> 01:24:00,570
What the fuck?

2065
01:24:03,510 --> 01:24:05,230
I... I wanted to...

2066
01:24:05,230 --> 01:24:06,290
It was one job.

2067
01:24:07,130 --> 01:24:07,690
Okay.

2068
01:24:08,030 --> 01:24:08,590
Alright.

2069
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:09,970
Why am I in this home?

2070
01:24:10,190 --> 01:24:11,790
What happened to my bed?

2071
01:24:13,970 --> 01:24:16,550
Why am I in this stranger's home?

2072
01:24:16,850 --> 01:24:18,290
How did I get here?

2073
01:24:20,730 --> 01:24:21,290
Okay.

2074
01:24:22,550 --> 01:24:23,950
Have we taken the photo?

2075
01:24:24,250 --> 01:24:25,310
Have we done it?

2076
01:24:25,950 --> 01:24:26,390
I...

2077
01:24:27,450 --> 01:24:30,090
I didn't even realize I slept in everyone's home.

2078
01:24:30,790 --> 01:24:31,230
Alright.

2079
01:24:31,410 --> 01:24:31,790
Okay.

2080
01:24:32,510 --> 01:24:33,990
I was crazy once.

2081
01:24:34,290 --> 01:24:35,630
They locked me in a room.

2082
01:24:35,770 --> 01:24:36,490
A rubber room.

2083
01:24:36,670 --> 01:24:37,970
A rubber room with rats.

2084
01:24:38,210 --> 01:24:39,770
And rats make me crazy.

2085
01:24:40,150 --> 01:24:40,590
Crazy?

2086
01:24:40,690 --> 01:24:41,730
I was crazy once.

2087
01:24:41,810 --> 01:24:42,790
They locked me in a room.

2088
01:24:42,910 --> 01:24:43,690
A rubber room.

2089
01:24:43,910 --> 01:24:45,110
A rubber room with rats.

2090
01:24:45,230 --> 01:24:46,430
And rats make me crazy.

2091
01:24:47,370 --> 01:24:47,750
Crazy?

2092
01:24:48,090 --> 01:24:48,850
I was crazy once.

2093
01:24:48,890 --> 01:24:49,810
They locked me in a room.

2094
01:24:50,110 --> 01:24:51,130
A rubber room.

2095
01:24:51,470 --> 01:24:52,710
A rubber room with rats.

2096
01:24:52,710 --> 01:24:53,950
And the rats make me crazy.

2097
01:24:54,170 --> 01:24:55,170
Did we get the photo?

2098
01:24:56,450 --> 01:25:00,110
Did we... I can't believe it was Bully Ranger in the final stream.

2099
01:25:02,110 --> 01:25:03,950
Did we get the photo?

2100
01:25:04,650 --> 01:25:05,910
Did we get the photo guys?

2101
01:25:09,690 --> 01:25:10,590
Oh we didn't?

2102
01:25:10,710 --> 01:25:11,330
Okay, okay.

2103
01:25:12,610 --> 01:25:13,370
Where's the tomato?

2104
01:25:13,490 --> 01:25:14,930
Let's get the photo again.

2105
01:25:15,350 --> 01:25:16,250
Let's do it again.

2106
01:25:18,170 --> 01:25:20,390
Whoever is doing the photo, come here.

2107
01:25:20,390 --> 01:25:22,910
So we can get the tomato in the background.

2108
01:25:23,170 --> 01:25:24,090
Are you house?

2109
01:25:24,150 --> 01:25:24,950
Dude, I don't know anymore.

2110
01:25:28,530 --> 01:25:29,850
This is it.

2111
01:25:31,010 --> 01:25:31,930
This is it!

2112
01:25:33,490 --> 01:25:34,050
Me...

2113
01:25:34,050 --> 01:25:35,590
and my bear skin.

2114
01:25:36,010 --> 01:25:36,730
This is it.

2115
01:25:37,210 --> 01:25:41,430
The final photo.

2116
01:25:42,010 --> 01:25:43,850
The final Minecraft photo.

2117
01:25:44,290 --> 01:25:45,350
Someone else do it.

2118
01:25:45,910 --> 01:25:47,230
I'm just standing here.

2119
01:25:47,510 --> 01:25:49,110
Someone else do it.

2120
01:25:51,130 --> 01:25:52,610
It's a 65%.

2121
01:25:52,610 --> 01:25:54,410
So not me.

2122
01:25:54,550 --> 01:25:56,170
I not do the photos.

2123
01:25:56,210 --> 01:25:57,270
Someone else do it.

2124
01:25:58,290 --> 01:26:01,270
I don't have the necessary buttons for it.

2125
01:26:04,510 --> 01:26:06,090
Who took the photo?

2126
01:26:07,990 --> 01:26:09,870
Or are we standing here forever?

2127
01:26:11,610 --> 01:26:12,990
Oh it has to be me?

2128
01:26:13,450 --> 01:26:14,030
Why?

2129
01:26:14,850 --> 01:26:16,210
Someone else do it.

2130
01:26:20,130 --> 01:26:20,630
Someone else do the photo.

2131
01:26:28,190 --> 01:26:29,710
Someone else do it.

2132
01:26:30,710 --> 01:26:32,070
Someone else do the photo.

2133
01:26:32,450 --> 01:26:33,470
Roy did it.

2134
01:26:33,570 --> 01:26:34,390
Roy did it.

2135
01:26:34,610 --> 01:26:35,110
Roy.

2136
01:26:35,490 --> 01:26:36,290
We did it.

2137
01:26:37,010 --> 01:26:37,910
Roy did it.

2138
01:26:38,010 --> 01:26:38,810
Alright, I'm good.

2139
01:26:39,370 --> 01:26:40,530
Roy did the photo.

2140
01:26:44,890 --> 01:26:45,390
I'm good.

2141
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:49,060
No, it's too much.

2142
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:50,340
Too much work.

2143
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:52,560
Just press F five times.

2144
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:54,380
Press F five times.

2145
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:56,440
Alright.

2146
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:57,280
Now I'm here.

2147
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:58,100
Are we good?

2148
01:26:58,280 --> 01:26:59,120
Did we do it?

2149
01:26:59,740 --> 01:27:00,540
Roy left.

2150
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:02,080
So that means we did it, right?

2151
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:03,220
We did it!

2152
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:03,940
Woo!

2153
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:07,100
That was our Minecraft server.

2154
01:27:08,540 --> 01:27:11,100
That was our Minecraft server, everyone.

2155
01:27:12,820 --> 01:27:14,940
Roy didn't even capture me.

2156
01:27:15,160 --> 01:27:16,140
I wasn't...

2157
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,640
I wasn't even in the photo.

2158
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:23,700
It's okay.

2159
01:27:24,120 --> 01:27:24,760
Okay.

2160
01:27:25,780 --> 01:27:28,660
I wasn't even in my own photo.

2161
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:30,340
I wasn't...

2162
01:27:30,340 --> 01:27:33,220
I wasn't even in my own photo.

2163
01:27:35,620 --> 01:27:36,980
We do this again.

2164
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:39,200
Chad, I wasn't in my own photo.

2165
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:41,320
How dare you, Roy.

2166
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:44,840
Yeah.

2167
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:47,320
Okay.

2168
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:48,300
Alright, we're good.

2169
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:48,900
Alright, alright.

2170
01:27:48,980 --> 01:27:49,980
Everyone, I'm leaving.

2171
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:51,160
Look, I'm leaving.

2172
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:52,980
I'm leaving.

2173
01:27:58,710 --> 01:28:02,270
Thank you, everyone, for coming to the Minecraft server tour.

2174
01:28:03,150 --> 01:28:04,690
And touring my hallway.

2175
01:28:04,890 --> 01:28:06,150
It was truly...

2176
01:28:07,010 --> 01:28:07,830
an experience.

2177
01:28:09,210 --> 01:28:13,250
I hope you all enjoyed the little Minecraft tour of the community server.

2178
01:28:13,450 --> 01:28:24,710
So, if you guys do not know, the server for those who will never be able to leave the Discord server, this Minecraft server will be here for for an entire month.

2179
01:28:24,990 --> 01:28:32,230
So, after that, after that, it's Azir's decision on what's gonna happen, cause he's the one that's running it right now.

2180
01:28:32,390 --> 01:28:33,830
So, thank you, everyone.

2181
01:28:34,030 --> 01:28:34,190
Yeah!

2182
01:28:34,310 --> 01:28:34,850
Get me!

2183
01:28:35,190 --> 01:28:36,610
I am poor now!

2184
01:28:38,390 --> 01:28:42,590
All the taxes I took from you are gone now.

2185
01:28:43,190 --> 01:28:46,730
All the taxes I took from you are gone now.

2186
01:28:46,730 --> 01:28:47,250
Thank you, Casino!

2187
01:28:47,550 --> 01:28:48,950
Thank you for dropping by!

2188
01:28:49,230 --> 01:28:49,650
I really do.

2189
01:28:49,810 --> 01:28:52,030
Now you're all poor and I am rich.

2190
01:28:56,190 --> 01:28:57,230
Alright, everyone.

2191
01:28:57,690 --> 01:28:59,090
I shall go now.

2192
01:28:59,330 --> 01:28:59,790
Goodbye!

2193
01:29:00,610 --> 01:29:01,130
Goodbye!

2194
01:29:03,130 --> 01:29:09,530
Alright, let me be right back real quick, guys, as we go back to the general... No, we go to the karaoke screen.

2195
01:29:09,690 --> 01:29:11,210
So, I'll be right back chat real quick.

2196
01:32:01,450 --> 01:32:03,250
I am back, everyone!

2197
01:32:04,370 --> 01:32:06,050
Let's put some jazz back on.

2198
01:32:06,450 --> 01:32:08,550
Let's put some... It's not over yet, Ninja!

2199
01:32:08,870 --> 01:32:13,730
You're just in time for this Doki Bird over the years.

2200
01:32:15,610 --> 01:32:18,630
Sadly, this was not done in Microsoft PowerPoint 2010.

2201
01:32:21,330 --> 01:32:21,810
Yamashii!

2202
01:32:21,930 --> 01:32:24,090
Thank you for the five gifted subs!

2203
01:32:24,970 --> 01:32:25,790
Thank you!

2204
01:32:26,550 --> 01:32:28,190
Thank you, thank you, Yamashii!

2205
01:32:28,330 --> 01:32:30,830
Can we get some... Also, Cory for the 100 biddies!

2206
01:32:30,910 --> 01:32:31,590
Thank you, guys!

2207
01:32:31,770 --> 01:32:32,250
Thank you!

2208
01:32:32,430 --> 01:32:33,070
Thank you!

2209
01:32:33,070 --> 01:32:34,150
Can we get some birthnights?

2210
01:32:34,370 --> 01:32:36,710
Real quick, real quick, guys.

2211
01:32:36,870 --> 01:32:38,350
Real quick for Yamashii.

2212
01:32:38,630 --> 01:32:39,290
Thank you.

2213
01:32:39,330 --> 01:32:40,050
And Princess!

2214
01:32:40,150 --> 01:32:42,470
We did two months at tier one!

2215
01:32:42,630 --> 01:32:43,730
Thank you, guys!

2216
01:32:44,010 --> 01:32:44,590
Thank you!

2217
01:32:44,610 --> 01:32:45,630
I also... Hi, Yuna!

2218
01:32:45,690 --> 01:32:46,790
I saw Yuna just popped in.

2219
01:32:46,970 --> 01:32:48,230
Thank you, thank you, everyone!

2220
01:32:48,390 --> 01:32:48,970
Thank you!

2221
01:32:49,870 --> 01:32:51,030
Thank you, everyone!

2222
01:32:52,190 --> 01:32:57,530
Alright, so... So, this is all PowerPoint where I'm gonna give you a little introspective.

2223
01:32:57,530 --> 01:32:59,670
Also, I like how tiny everyone is up there.

2224
01:33:02,550 --> 01:33:04,870
Look at how tiny Yamashii is!

2225
01:33:05,150 --> 01:33:06,190
Let me fix that.

2226
01:33:08,250 --> 01:33:08,690
So...

2227
01:33:09,310 --> 01:33:13,430
Let me give you a little... After this, we're gonna go through the marshmallows too, after this.

2228
01:33:14,010 --> 01:33:14,450
So...

2229
01:33:14,450 --> 01:33:16,430
We're so into Nougatpops!

2230
01:33:18,910 --> 01:33:19,350
Alright.

2231
01:33:19,530 --> 01:33:21,670
So, this is DokiBird over the years.

2232
01:33:21,890 --> 01:33:22,770
I will... Zero!

2233
01:33:22,890 --> 01:33:24,530
Thank you for the tier one too!

2234
01:33:24,870 --> 01:33:25,830
Thank you, thank you!

2235
01:33:25,930 --> 01:33:26,730
More birthnights!

2236
01:33:26,810 --> 01:33:27,530
More birthnights!

2237
01:33:27,530 --> 01:33:28,070
Everyone!

2238
01:33:28,250 --> 01:33:29,470
Thank you, Zero!

2239
01:33:29,570 --> 01:33:31,030
For the tier one!

2240
01:33:31,250 --> 01:33:32,350
Thank you, thank you, everyone!

2241
01:33:32,730 --> 01:33:33,690
Thank you, guys!

2242
01:33:34,010 --> 01:33:34,550
Thank you!

2243
01:33:35,850 --> 01:33:36,970
Thank you, everyone!

2244
01:33:38,010 --> 01:33:39,330
Alright, and also a little...

2245
01:33:39,330 --> 01:33:40,650
A little heart for you guys too.

2246
01:33:40,730 --> 01:33:41,850
We haven't had buttharts in a while.

2247
01:33:42,070 --> 01:33:43,710
Cause I couldn't think of the followers.

2248
01:33:43,950 --> 01:33:44,730
There's too many.

2249
01:33:44,910 --> 01:33:46,910
But here's all the followers too.

2250
01:33:47,110 --> 01:33:48,170
Have a butthart, everyone!

2251
01:33:49,710 --> 01:33:50,730
Alright, so...

2252
01:33:50,730 --> 01:33:52,790
Let me take you my history.

2253
01:33:53,430 --> 01:33:55,270
So, let me take you my history.

2254
01:33:55,470 --> 01:33:57,470
Before I start, please bear with me.

2255
01:33:57,530 --> 01:33:59,990
Cause, um, I was very young.

2256
01:34:00,610 --> 01:34:01,070
And...

2257
01:34:01,070 --> 01:34:05,010
And because I was very young, I didn't really have a sense of fashion.

2258
01:34:05,290 --> 01:34:08,790
You know, little kids, when they think like, Oh, this looks nice.

2259
01:34:09,030 --> 01:34:10,650
But it doesn't look nice.

2260
01:34:13,670 --> 01:34:15,670
I thought it looked nice, okay?

2261
01:34:16,050 --> 01:34:18,210
I thought it looked nice on me!

2262
01:34:18,650 --> 01:34:19,670
Alright, so...

2263
01:34:20,510 --> 01:34:21,710
So, let me show you.

2264
01:34:22,410 --> 01:34:25,550
In 2012, um, I used to have a twin.

2265
01:34:25,610 --> 01:34:26,750
I'm an only child now.

2266
01:34:31,770 --> 01:34:32,530
So...

2267
01:34:32,530 --> 01:34:34,310
So, I'm an only child now.

2268
01:34:34,470 --> 01:34:34,570
So, I'm an only child now.

2269
01:34:34,570 --> 01:34:35,490
What happened to the twin?

2270
01:34:35,790 --> 01:34:37,670
Well, we'll never know!

2271
01:34:38,010 --> 01:34:40,010
We'll never know!

2272
01:34:40,710 --> 01:34:40,830
We'll never know!

2273
01:34:44,490 --> 01:34:46,530
The twin got eliminated!

2274
01:34:48,510 --> 01:34:49,630
Who knows?

2275
01:34:50,070 --> 01:34:51,590
There's no evidence or proof!

2276
01:34:52,870 --> 01:34:56,590
I've always been a thief since 2012.

2277
01:34:56,950 --> 01:34:57,510
I've always been a thief since 2012.

2278
01:34:57,530 --> 01:34:58,690
I've always been a... I can't see!

2279
01:34:58,770 --> 01:35:00,090
For some reason, I'm blind right now!

2280
01:35:00,210 --> 01:35:02,350
I can't see my chat for some reason!

2281
01:35:02,650 --> 01:35:03,630
Alright, I...

2282
01:35:08,710 --> 01:35:09,750
Alright, so...

2283
01:35:10,630 --> 01:35:11,150
Alright, so...

2284
01:35:11,150 --> 01:35:13,630
So, I've always been a thief, but I wasn't...

2285
01:35:13,630 --> 01:35:15,490
I didn't have this outfit before.

2286
01:35:15,750 --> 01:35:18,790
So, this was my original outfit in 2012.

2287
01:35:19,150 --> 01:35:24,250
And I realized, hmm, maybe beige and blue doesn't go very well.

2288
01:35:26,750 --> 01:35:29,570
So, I went full blue a bit later.

2289
01:35:29,990 --> 01:35:32,210
As you see my ex-twin over there.

2290
01:35:36,250 --> 01:35:37,690
Can you see this?

2291
01:35:38,290 --> 01:35:39,430
It's so awesome!

2292
01:35:39,870 --> 01:35:48,590
But this was my very first outfit and my very first, like, how I like to see myself in 2012.

2293
01:35:48,950 --> 01:35:52,950
And I used to have braided pigtails.

2294
01:35:53,090 --> 01:35:54,870
And so, I was like, just twin tails.

2295
01:35:55,010 --> 01:35:56,670
I had braided pigtails instead.

2296
01:35:56,970 --> 01:35:58,650
And I realized, that's way too much work.

2297
01:35:58,910 --> 01:35:59,630
That's way...

2298
01:35:59,630 --> 01:36:00,890
That's way too much work.

2299
01:36:00,930 --> 01:36:02,450
Do you know how much work braiding is?

2300
01:36:02,730 --> 01:36:03,290
So, I...

2301
01:36:03,290 --> 01:36:05,030
I got rid of that.

2302
01:36:06,230 --> 01:36:10,550
So, now we have our little... our signature... Then I got lazy.

2303
01:36:10,990 --> 01:36:11,770
Then I...

2304
01:36:11,770 --> 01:36:13,250
Then I got lazy.

2305
01:36:17,390 --> 01:36:19,170
Two enter, one survive.

2306
01:36:19,770 --> 01:36:20,530
So, alright.

2307
01:36:20,730 --> 01:36:21,830
So, that was 2012.

2308
01:36:22,150 --> 01:36:23,290
Survival of the fittest.

2309
01:36:23,370 --> 01:36:23,670
Exactly.

2310
01:36:24,250 --> 01:36:27,570
So, in 2014, I got my new alternate outfit.

2311
01:36:27,830 --> 01:36:30,370
So, this one, you might recognize this one a lot more.

2312
01:36:30,890 --> 01:36:31,410
Um...

2313
01:36:32,010 --> 01:36:33,030
The twin's still here.

2314
01:36:33,170 --> 01:36:33,750
But don't worry.

2315
01:36:33,870 --> 01:36:36,110
In the next line, I became an only child.

2316
01:36:36,490 --> 01:36:37,010
So...

2317
01:36:41,230 --> 01:36:43,790
But in 2014, uh...

2318
01:36:43,790 --> 01:36:45,950
The twin was... My twin was still there.

2319
01:36:46,150 --> 01:36:48,170
My twin... My ex-twin was still here.

2320
01:36:48,430 --> 01:36:49,070
Don't worry.

2321
01:36:49,310 --> 01:36:49,990
Don't worry.

2322
01:36:50,110 --> 01:36:52,590
He'll be gone... He'll be gone in the next year.

2323
01:36:56,390 --> 01:36:57,590
Never got...

2324
01:36:57,590 --> 01:36:57,990
Never got...

2325
01:36:57,990 --> 01:37:00,370
He went into the hallway and never came back.

2326
01:37:00,530 --> 01:37:01,450
He went into the...

2327
01:37:02,830 --> 01:37:05,170
I don't seem very sad though.

2328
01:37:08,410 --> 01:37:09,050
But...

2329
01:37:09,050 --> 01:37:12,330
But that was my first alternate outfit.

2330
01:37:12,450 --> 01:37:13,190
So handsome!

2331
01:37:15,190 --> 01:37:20,070
So, that was my, uh... first alternate outfit.

2332
01:37:20,350 --> 01:37:21,970
And, um...

2333
01:37:23,250 --> 01:37:24,770
Um... This is a very recognized.

2334
01:37:24,830 --> 01:37:25,610
You can see the signature.

2335
01:37:25,870 --> 01:37:27,070
I've always kept the hat.

2336
01:37:27,610 --> 01:37:30,410
Uh... I've always kept my hat and my pigtails.

2337
01:37:30,590 --> 01:37:33,990
We don't... We don't talk about the... the braided pigtails.

2338
01:37:34,050 --> 01:37:35,010
We don't talk about that time.

2339
01:37:35,230 --> 01:37:36,130
That was cursed.

2340
01:37:36,410 --> 01:37:38,970
That was when I didn't have any sense of anything.

2341
01:37:39,130 --> 01:37:41,670
I don't know how to...

2342
01:37:41,670 --> 01:37:43,530
I don't know how colors work apparently.

2343
01:37:45,850 --> 01:37:47,450
He's left in my heart.

2344
01:37:48,770 --> 01:37:49,590
He's gone!

2345
01:37:49,890 --> 01:37:51,390
He got accepted, Link!

2346
01:37:51,390 --> 01:37:52,330
He got accepted!

2347
01:37:52,770 --> 01:37:54,230
He's gone forever!

2348
01:37:56,670 --> 01:37:58,190
What do you mean VTuber?

2349
01:37:58,750 --> 01:38:00,150
I've always been me.

2350
01:38:00,250 --> 01:38:02,170
I've always been me since 2012.

2351
01:38:02,550 --> 01:38:03,690
Since 2012.

2352
01:38:04,270 --> 01:38:05,590
It's always been me.

2353
01:38:07,050 --> 01:38:11,050
And then after that, I discovered the world of VTubing.

2354
01:38:11,730 --> 01:38:13,370
And then I lost my twin.

2355
01:38:13,590 --> 01:38:14,850
And then I lost...

2356
01:38:14,850 --> 01:38:17,870
And then I discovered the world of VTubing.

2357
01:38:18,010 --> 01:38:19,450
And then I lost my twin.

2358
01:38:19,750 --> 01:38:20,850
And then I lost my twin.

2359
01:38:20,850 --> 01:38:21,370
And then I lost my twin.

2360
01:38:23,290 --> 01:38:23,810
So...

2361
01:38:24,610 --> 01:38:25,130
So...

2362
01:38:25,130 --> 01:38:25,870
That's a big gap.

2363
01:38:26,170 --> 01:38:29,110
It's because I kept my other outfit...

2364
01:38:29,930 --> 01:38:31,970
My other outfit for so long.

2365
01:38:32,170 --> 01:38:33,450
But then I realized...

2366
01:38:34,070 --> 01:38:36,350
This first model was done by Itzera.

2367
01:38:36,850 --> 01:38:38,770
Who you might know from Iron Vortex.

2368
01:38:38,890 --> 01:38:41,450
But this was before she was really in...

2369
01:38:41,450 --> 01:38:42,970
She was in Iron Vortex.

2370
01:38:43,230 --> 01:38:45,350
But this was before the guild was really popular.

2371
01:38:45,470 --> 01:38:48,050
It was before the big VTuber boom.

2372
01:38:48,970 --> 01:38:51,370
It was before the big VTuber boom.

2373
01:38:51,390 --> 01:38:53,290
So I got a commission from Itzera.

2374
01:38:53,530 --> 01:38:54,510
But she was...

2375
01:38:54,510 --> 01:38:57,210
I wasn't through Iron Vortex at that time.

2376
01:38:57,830 --> 01:38:58,310
And...

2377
01:38:59,150 --> 01:39:01,230
And at that point, I was like...

2378
01:39:01,230 --> 01:39:01,650
Oh!

2379
01:39:02,350 --> 01:39:05,130
She gave me the design of...

2380
01:39:05,130 --> 01:39:07,390
My first model.

2381
01:39:07,830 --> 01:39:08,910
Back in...

2382
01:39:08,910 --> 01:39:09,830
She's getting milk chat.

2383
01:39:09,870 --> 01:39:10,290
He'll be back.

2384
01:39:10,350 --> 01:39:11,430
Yeah, he'll be back.

2385
01:39:11,550 --> 01:39:12,610
But I'm an only child, though.

2386
01:39:13,970 --> 01:39:14,770
He'll be back.

2387
01:39:14,830 --> 01:39:15,570
I'm an only child.

2388
01:39:15,870 --> 01:39:17,450
I'm an only child.

2389
01:39:18,990 --> 01:39:19,470
I'm an only child.

2390
01:39:20,130 --> 01:39:20,610
So...

2391
01:39:21,490 --> 01:39:31,050
I realized, I was like, well, it doesn't look... I realized even though that design, I really love my outfit back then.

2392
01:39:31,270 --> 01:39:34,490
I realized that it might have been too plain, I guess.

2393
01:39:34,710 --> 01:39:36,830
I was like, oh that's too plain.

2394
01:39:36,970 --> 01:39:40,090
Maybe I should spice it up a little.

2395
01:39:40,430 --> 01:39:42,150
Do whatever you want with the model.

2396
01:39:42,230 --> 01:39:43,050
Just spice it up.

2397
01:39:43,090 --> 01:39:44,150
Do whatever you want with my outfit.

2398
01:39:44,330 --> 01:39:44,910
Spice it up.

2399
01:39:44,910 --> 01:39:52,010
And then she added all these new stripes, the accessories, the pins and everything.

2400
01:39:52,250 --> 01:39:53,230
And I'm like, perfect!

2401
01:39:55,070 --> 01:39:59,970
Because I was like, I paid thousands to have this done.

2402
01:40:00,070 --> 01:40:01,130
I might as well add more.

2403
01:40:01,390 --> 01:40:03,110
I want more accessories!

2404
01:40:03,590 --> 01:40:05,710
Because it doesn't add more to the value.

2405
01:40:05,930 --> 01:40:07,870
The thing is, it didn't add more to the value.

2406
01:40:07,930 --> 01:40:09,710
So I was like, give me more!

2407
01:40:10,990 --> 01:40:13,290
I'm getting my money's worth.

2408
01:40:15,530 --> 01:40:19,450
And I was like, this is not worth a thousand.

2409
01:40:19,730 --> 01:40:21,570
I'm getting my money's worth.

2410
01:40:25,550 --> 01:40:27,750
So that was in 2020.

2411
01:40:28,070 --> 01:40:31,650
In 2020, that was us, your twin, the tomato.

2412
01:40:32,910 --> 01:40:33,910
Who knows?

2413
01:40:34,050 --> 01:40:34,630
Who knows?

2414
01:40:34,650 --> 01:40:36,070
I'm just an only child now.

2415
01:40:36,170 --> 01:40:36,650
What twin?

2416
01:40:36,810 --> 01:40:38,530
I never had a twin, guys.

2417
01:40:38,810 --> 01:40:40,330
What are you talking about?

2418
01:40:40,470 --> 01:40:42,990
I've just been solo the entire time.

2419
01:40:45,910 --> 01:40:46,830
What twin?

2420
01:40:46,970 --> 01:40:48,350
I don't see no twin here.

2421
01:40:48,490 --> 01:40:49,310
It's just me.

2422
01:40:49,450 --> 01:40:50,630
Where's the twin here?

2423
01:40:53,550 --> 01:40:54,110
Alright.

2424
01:40:54,110 --> 01:40:55,390
Never heard of them.

2425
01:40:55,550 --> 01:40:56,710
Never heard of them.

2426
01:40:58,490 --> 01:41:03,430
And then after that, after that, the 3D model.

2427
01:41:03,690 --> 01:41:06,090
So this was my first live 2D model.

2428
01:41:06,410 --> 01:41:11,870
And after the same year, I also got my 3D model for it.

2429
01:41:11,890 --> 01:41:13,030
Because I was like, wow!

2430
01:41:13,590 --> 01:41:15,770
I can have hand trackers?

2431
01:41:15,770 --> 01:41:20,310
Because this one was done by Rika and his guild, Artemis Clones.

2432
01:41:20,610 --> 01:41:24,170
And I got a 3D model because I wanted to use my hands.

2433
01:41:24,350 --> 01:41:27,670
And I was like, that was back when I was like, I want hands.

2434
01:41:27,710 --> 01:41:32,570
How am I going to steal people's money if I can't fucking stick it in someone's pocket and go, yoink?

2435
01:41:36,950 --> 01:41:39,450
She just turned her twin into a dog, Kappa.

2436
01:41:41,310 --> 01:41:42,670
And so, um...

2437
01:41:43,830 --> 01:41:45,950
So this was the first time, uh...

2438
01:41:45,950 --> 01:41:48,090
This was my first 3D model.

2439
01:41:49,450 --> 01:41:50,710
So, uh, was that.

2440
01:41:50,810 --> 01:41:52,550
That was done by, like I said, it was done by Rika.

2441
01:41:53,730 --> 01:41:54,530
And, um...

2442
01:41:54,530 --> 01:41:56,230
We had a lot of fun with this model.

2443
01:41:56,450 --> 01:41:57,350
We did a lot of things.

2444
01:41:57,410 --> 01:42:01,790
I feel like the only reason I used that model was to give all of you middle fingers.

2445
01:42:02,190 --> 01:42:03,730
And that was a good time.

2446
01:42:04,050 --> 01:42:05,910
And that was a good time.

2447
01:42:06,690 --> 01:42:09,310
I think that was the first thing I did with a new model.

2448
01:42:09,310 --> 01:42:11,950
I was like, guys, look what I can do.

2449
01:42:13,190 --> 01:42:16,770
Oh yeah, and that was when the butt hearts were born.

2450
01:42:17,050 --> 01:42:18,010
That was it.

2451
01:42:18,490 --> 01:42:19,570
Oh yeah, you're right.

2452
01:42:19,790 --> 01:42:22,370
This was how the butt heart was born.

2453
01:42:22,570 --> 01:42:24,070
Because I couldn't make a real part.

2454
01:42:24,510 --> 01:42:26,170
Like, my hands couldn't make a heart.

2455
01:42:26,250 --> 01:42:27,230
It just looked like a butt.

2456
01:42:27,470 --> 01:42:28,430
And that's...

2457
01:42:31,030 --> 01:42:32,890
And that's where it came from.

2458
01:42:33,310 --> 01:42:36,070
Yeah, and I was like, there's a little hole on top of the heart.

2459
01:42:36,170 --> 01:42:37,170
Like a little butt hole.

2460
01:42:40,330 --> 01:42:44,370
And that's where it came from.

2461
01:42:46,910 --> 01:42:49,110
Okay, the era of the butt hearts.

2462
01:42:49,290 --> 01:42:51,750
And then I don't remember what's after this.

2463
01:42:52,130 --> 01:42:53,990
What is after this, guys?

2464
01:42:55,070 --> 01:42:55,370
Ah!

2465
01:42:55,770 --> 01:43:00,030
The introduction of the first appearance of Mei Mei and Bao Bao.

2466
01:43:00,970 --> 01:43:01,570
Necklobuster!

2467
01:43:02,550 --> 01:43:06,110
Thank you for the tier one 47 month streak!

2468
01:43:07,010 --> 01:43:08,290
Can we get some...

2469
01:43:09,310 --> 01:43:12,170
Spark nights real quick for Necklo!

2470
01:43:12,290 --> 01:43:13,830
47 months!

2471
01:43:14,330 --> 01:43:15,170
Oh my god!

2472
01:43:18,010 --> 01:43:20,010
Thank you, Necklo!

2473
01:43:21,270 --> 01:43:22,630
So sweet.

2474
01:43:22,690 --> 01:43:23,770
It really is.

2475
01:43:24,070 --> 01:43:24,790
Thank you.

2476
01:43:25,350 --> 01:43:27,930
And some final butt hearts from the...

2477
01:43:27,930 --> 01:43:29,250
Spark nights!

2478
01:43:30,050 --> 01:43:31,370
Thank you, thank you!

2479
01:43:32,070 --> 01:43:34,690
I'm glad you had a great time with us.

2480
01:43:34,730 --> 01:43:36,430
A great journey with all of us.

2481
01:43:36,810 --> 01:43:37,810
Thank you.

2482
01:43:37,950 --> 01:43:38,950
It really does.

2483
01:43:39,310 --> 01:43:39,850
It does mean a lot.

2484
01:43:43,210 --> 01:43:44,450
Oh my gosh.

2485
01:43:44,770 --> 01:43:45,630
Oh gee!

2486
01:43:45,830 --> 01:43:47,970
It was back when I used to play Overwatch, too.

2487
01:43:48,110 --> 01:43:51,010
Back in my dark times in Overwatch.

2488
01:43:54,890 --> 01:43:59,050
Alright, so this was the very first appearance of Mei Mei and Bao Bao.

2489
01:43:59,610 --> 01:44:00,170
And...

2490
01:44:00,170 --> 01:44:02,130
It was actually by coincidence.

2491
01:44:02,550 --> 01:44:03,830
Because, okay...

2492
01:44:03,830 --> 01:44:06,170
Okay, the lore is that...

2493
01:44:06,170 --> 01:44:07,690
The lore...

2494
01:44:07,690 --> 01:44:08,550
The lore...

2495
01:44:15,090 --> 01:44:18,170
I found them in the laboratory and I took them.

2496
01:44:19,850 --> 01:44:26,170
This was the very first appearance of Mei Mei and Bao Bao in July 2020.

2497
01:44:26,790 --> 01:44:32,710
And Mei Mei is the black rabbit and Bao Bao is the white one.

2498
01:44:32,710 --> 01:44:34,650
So you guys don't know which is which.

2499
01:44:34,830 --> 01:44:39,630
Because Mei Mei means sister and Bao Bao is just bun.

2500
01:44:39,790 --> 01:44:40,790
Because he looks like a little bun.

2501
01:44:42,110 --> 01:44:43,890
I just stole them from a lab.

2502
01:44:44,170 --> 01:44:45,910
It's okay, they're using up all my money.

2503
01:44:46,290 --> 01:44:48,610
They've been ordering Uber Eats everyday so that's cool.

2504
01:44:49,630 --> 01:44:51,510
Why do you think I'm always broke, guys?

2505
01:44:51,770 --> 01:44:54,870
Why do you think I'm always running out of money, everyone?

2506
01:45:00,170 --> 01:45:01,750
So that was the very...

2507
01:45:02,710 --> 01:45:05,030
very first appearance of my little bunny minions.

2508
01:45:05,410 --> 01:45:08,910
The very first time they appeared in my life.

2509
01:45:09,130 --> 01:45:14,090
And then these were the references from my 1.0 design.

2510
01:45:14,090 --> 01:45:18,030
I like to call this... well not 1.0, I'll call this 1.50.

2511
01:45:18,330 --> 01:45:23,670
This was the very first... these were the very first official references of my 1.5 design.

2512
01:45:24,070 --> 01:45:28,950
Left side was done by Heartpuff and the right side was done by WK4.

2513
01:45:29,450 --> 01:45:31,810
So they're both very talented artists.

2514
01:45:32,710 --> 01:45:34,950
And just a little... little... little...

2515
01:45:34,950 --> 01:45:37,050
little bit of bonus for all of you.

2516
01:45:37,150 --> 01:45:39,690
One of the first reference sheets I have.

2517
01:45:41,550 --> 01:45:45,810
One of the very first reference sheets I have of me, basically.

2518
01:45:47,410 --> 01:45:49,650
And then the next slide.

2519
01:45:49,770 --> 01:45:50,830
I think it's my alternate.

2520
01:45:51,010 --> 01:45:52,110
The alternate outfit!

2521
01:45:52,670 --> 01:45:55,330
I just want to notice a lot of people's favorites.

2522
01:45:55,390 --> 01:45:57,830
This outfit was a lot of people's favorites.

2523
01:45:57,990 --> 01:45:58,530
Slime 2.

2524
01:45:58,910 --> 01:46:02,430
So WK made me new clothes.

2525
01:46:02,710 --> 01:46:05,010
And I was like, I want 3D of this.

2526
01:46:06,370 --> 01:46:08,390
So I can move my hands with this too.

2527
01:46:08,950 --> 01:46:10,490
And it looks beautiful.

2528
01:46:10,970 --> 01:46:12,550
It should be beautiful.

2529
01:46:13,490 --> 01:46:14,450
Simply... simply...

2530
01:46:14,930 --> 01:46:15,410
Beautiful.

2531
01:46:16,490 --> 01:46:18,730
So I can walk out in public, you know?

2532
01:46:18,890 --> 01:46:21,570
Because I can't walk out like this all the time, guys.

2533
01:46:21,610 --> 01:46:22,410
I can't.

2534
01:46:22,410 --> 01:46:22,990
What the heck?

2535
01:46:23,250 --> 01:46:25,430
Like people will be like, that looks like a thief.

2536
01:46:28,210 --> 01:46:28,690
Hmm.

2537
01:46:29,190 --> 01:46:30,990
Why does she have traps everywhere?

2538
01:46:30,990 --> 01:46:33,670
That looks like a main character of a show.

2539
01:46:36,750 --> 01:46:38,050
So I have to...

2540
01:46:38,050 --> 01:46:41,890
I have to get another outfit done for myself so I can blend in.

2541
01:46:42,250 --> 01:46:46,530
I can blend in with everyone in the public.

2542
01:46:47,590 --> 01:46:49,550
So this was my very...

2543
01:46:49,550 --> 01:46:51,110
That looks like the other twin.

2544
01:46:56,370 --> 01:46:58,370
That outfit... no, it's like...

2545
01:46:58,370 --> 01:46:59,650
That can't be a thief.

2546
01:46:59,650 --> 01:47:01,910
She's wearing casual clothes.

2547
01:47:02,130 --> 01:47:03,970
She looks like a background character.

2548
01:47:08,540 --> 01:47:10,400
So that was the first...

2549
01:47:10,400 --> 01:47:12,460
Now I think this next slide, I have a feeling what it is.

2550
01:47:12,620 --> 01:47:13,740
And I'm gonna say...

2551
01:47:13,740 --> 01:47:15,580
What I'm gonna say is...

2552
01:47:15,580 --> 01:47:16,680
What could have been.

2553
01:47:16,900 --> 01:47:17,900
What could have been.

2554
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:18,860
So I've been...

2555
01:47:18,860 --> 01:47:21,340
This one, I got this a while ago.

2556
01:47:21,460 --> 01:47:22,780
Like a long... a long...

2557
01:47:23,340 --> 01:47:24,420
Not a while ago.

2558
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:27,700
I was like...

2559
01:47:27,700 --> 01:47:29,300
I don't remember when I got this.

2560
01:47:29,340 --> 01:47:30,600
But this was a little bit ago.

2561
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:34,060
But before I got contacted by the bank team...

2562
01:47:34,060 --> 01:47:35,160
I had a little...

2563
01:47:36,120 --> 01:47:38,680
I had a little thing I wanted to do.

2564
01:47:38,740 --> 01:47:40,060
Like with my extra cash.

2565
01:47:40,280 --> 01:47:42,180
So I was paying this off slowly by slowly.

2566
01:47:42,480 --> 01:47:45,240
And it was like with my extra cash I have that saved up.

2567
01:47:45,380 --> 01:47:46,720
So like I would put a little bit.

2568
01:47:47,100 --> 01:47:47,700
And I...

2569
01:47:48,120 --> 01:47:49,700
My dream was to like...

2570
01:47:49,700 --> 01:47:51,600
So let me show you what it is now first.

2571
01:47:51,700 --> 01:47:52,420
Let me show you.

2572
01:47:53,420 --> 01:47:54,200
Oh wait, no!

2573
01:47:54,280 --> 01:47:54,920
This is 2.0!

2574
01:47:56,920 --> 01:47:57,320
Okay.

2575
01:47:58,300 --> 01:47:59,720
Alright, this is 2.0!

2576
01:48:02,840 --> 01:48:03,680
I was...

2577
01:48:03,680 --> 01:48:05,200
I clearly forgot myself.

2578
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:07,040
I forgot myself, guys.

2579
01:48:10,720 --> 01:48:11,660
Oh, I'm sorry.

2580
01:48:11,740 --> 01:48:12,460
I forgot about Clea.

2581
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:15,940
It's hard when I'm already here.

2582
01:48:16,240 --> 01:48:17,240
Like why am I over there?

2583
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:18,940
Why am I over there, guys?

2584
01:48:19,040 --> 01:48:19,900
When I'm here?

2585
01:48:23,980 --> 01:48:24,500
Alright.

2586
01:48:24,660 --> 01:48:25,540
I'm sorry, Clea.

2587
01:48:27,320 --> 01:48:29,720
I have too many identities, guys.

2588
01:48:29,720 --> 01:48:31,780
I can't remember all of them.

2589
01:48:35,220 --> 01:48:36,820
And now there's four of me?

2590
01:48:37,020 --> 01:48:38,580
Why are there so many of me?

2591
01:48:38,720 --> 01:48:39,280
Don't worry.

2592
01:48:39,340 --> 01:48:40,700
I'll be an only child again soon.

2593
01:48:40,940 --> 01:48:43,200
I'll be an only child again soon.

2594
01:48:45,360 --> 01:48:46,600
So this is...

2595
01:48:46,600 --> 01:48:48,440
I feel like I talked about Clea...

2596
01:48:48,440 --> 01:48:50,060
The one I went with Clea.

2597
01:48:50,160 --> 01:48:51,260
I talked about this before.

2598
01:48:51,940 --> 01:48:53,780
For the debut graduation stream.

2599
01:48:53,880 --> 01:48:54,460
So I'll make...

2600
01:48:54,460 --> 01:48:57,540
I'll make this a bit more quick.

2601
01:48:58,020 --> 01:49:01,260
Because a lot of this was already talked about during the...

2602
01:49:01,260 --> 01:49:02,680
graduation announcement stream.

2603
01:49:02,740 --> 01:49:05,280
The re-debut slash graduation announcement stream.

2604
01:49:05,480 --> 01:49:08,040
But I went to Clea for 2.0.

2605
01:49:08,180 --> 01:49:09,260
2.0.

2606
01:49:09,260 --> 01:49:11,000
Because I was like, RieDoki is the...

2607
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:11,760
twin.

2608
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:15,040
So at first, we went with...

2609
01:49:15,040 --> 01:49:17,560
It was between the red and the blue color scheme.

2610
01:49:17,860 --> 01:49:21,700
Because the original design was inspired by the Vocaloid song.

2611
01:49:21,960 --> 01:49:23,120
Phantom Thieves.

2612
01:49:23,300 --> 01:49:25,500
Phantom Thieves song from Vocaloid.

2613
01:49:25,620 --> 01:49:27,120
And they're twins.

2614
01:49:27,480 --> 01:49:28,640
I'm an only child.

2615
01:49:33,300 --> 01:49:33,780
So...

2616
01:49:33,780 --> 01:49:34,540
So...

2617
01:49:34,540 --> 01:49:36,160
I decided to go with the blue.

2618
01:49:36,220 --> 01:49:37,600
Because the blue and the gray.

2619
01:49:37,700 --> 01:49:39,280
Because I felt like that matches well...

2620
01:49:39,800 --> 01:49:41,200
With the original...

2621
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:42,480
Colors.

2622
01:49:42,740 --> 01:49:43,880
With the original colors.

2623
01:49:43,940 --> 01:49:44,720
And I felt like...

2624
01:49:44,720 --> 01:49:46,500
I feel like wearing red...

2625
01:49:46,500 --> 01:49:49,700
Would make me much more noticeable in public.

2626
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:51,100
Like, where did she go?

2627
01:49:51,280 --> 01:49:54,380
Look at this bright red color in the crowd.

2628
01:49:54,700 --> 01:49:55,740
Is that her?

2629
01:49:58,520 --> 01:50:01,060
So I was like, maybe gray is better.

2630
01:50:01,140 --> 01:50:01,240
I don't know.

2631
01:50:01,260 --> 01:50:01,480
Maybe.

2632
01:50:03,300 --> 01:50:04,700
It's like, where did she go?

2633
01:50:04,840 --> 01:50:05,460
It's okay.

2634
01:50:05,580 --> 01:50:08,300
The only person that's wearing red is right there.

2635
01:50:09,620 --> 01:50:12,600
The each one performed the reverse mitosis.

2636
01:50:13,160 --> 01:50:15,460
So it was better for camouflage too.

2637
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:16,540
The blending in...

2638
01:50:16,540 --> 01:50:18,520
Blending in with the crowd and everything.

2639
01:50:19,460 --> 01:50:21,900
And then we all know about my Cheeto bag over there.

2640
01:50:22,020 --> 01:50:23,920
Where I store my lock picking stuff.

2641
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:24,380
Cheetos.

2642
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:25,460
And my mic.

2643
01:50:25,600 --> 01:50:27,220
My mini miniature mic.

2644
01:50:27,420 --> 01:50:28,640
I had the tomatoes things.

2645
01:50:28,880 --> 01:50:29,700
The merchant.

2646
01:50:30,240 --> 01:50:31,240
I had the...

2647
01:50:33,020 --> 01:50:37,940
Okay, now I think the next slide is the one I was going to talk about.

2648
01:50:38,180 --> 01:50:39,560
So what could have been?

2649
01:50:39,740 --> 01:50:43,180
This is... next one is what could have been guys?

2650
01:50:43,340 --> 01:50:46,240
What could have been before the bank team caught me?

2651
01:50:46,340 --> 01:50:48,240
Before the bank team caught me.

2652
01:50:48,420 --> 01:50:50,500
So what could have been?

2653
01:50:50,700 --> 01:50:56,420
So my... before my... before I had that graduation announcement.

2654
01:50:59,400 --> 01:51:03,560
My plan was to... I love collecting.

2655
01:51:03,720 --> 01:51:06,560
I love collecting pictures of myself because I'm a narcissistic.

2656
01:51:07,480 --> 01:51:10,000
Because I'm narcissistic.

2657
01:51:10,240 --> 01:51:11,700
I love myself.

2658
01:51:17,380 --> 01:51:26,820
So I think we all know how much I love collecting artwork and different clothes of myself.

2659
01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:29,600
So my plan before my graduation was...

2660
01:51:29,600 --> 01:51:30,340
Was that...

2661
01:51:31,480 --> 01:51:36,560
Was that I wanted to collect outfits from different artists around...

2662
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:39,400
Different like amazing artists around.

2663
01:51:39,540 --> 01:51:42,720
So I wanted to have like a little collection of outfits and stuff.

2664
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,720
From like... instead of like alternate outfits, I just have...

2665
01:51:46,920 --> 01:51:47,840
Alternate outfits.

2666
01:51:49,220 --> 01:51:50,800
You guys know what I mean?

2667
01:51:51,100 --> 01:51:53,540
You guys... you guys know what I mean?

2668
01:52:02,100 --> 01:52:04,140
Alternate... alternate universes.

2669
01:52:05,740 --> 01:52:08,000
But that was... I was saving... so...

2670
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:11,900
This... what... this... it never got... I never got rigged.

2671
01:52:12,300 --> 01:52:18,340
So... I only got to the point of getting the model or my outfit.

2672
01:52:18,660 --> 01:52:25,320
So at that point I... it was going to be done by Iron Vortex and Artgun.

2673
01:52:25,320 --> 01:52:27,320
Like a... between the two.

2674
01:52:27,720 --> 01:52:29,000
But what could it have been?

2675
01:52:29,120 --> 01:52:30,040
And we had Itosan.

2676
01:52:30,100 --> 01:52:31,520
I was going to drink from Itosan.

2677
01:52:31,660 --> 01:52:33,620
We were going to have like... Itosan...

2678
01:52:33,620 --> 01:52:36,460
Yeah, because all my... all my faces and clothes were clip-ons, guys.

2679
01:52:36,560 --> 01:52:36,960
Don't you remember?

2680
01:52:37,680 --> 01:52:41,640
I could have just easily clip-on a different outfit and a different face.

2681
01:52:41,980 --> 01:52:42,940
Easy like that.

2682
01:52:45,460 --> 01:52:49,640
Just... just take off... just... just take off my clothes.

2683
01:52:50,180 --> 01:52:53,220
Just take off my clip-ons and then clip another.

2684
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:53,840
Pop.

2685
01:52:55,440 --> 01:52:57,400
Into the Dokiverse we go!

2686
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:00,480
So...

2687
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:04,080
This is the Doki Cinematic Universe, guys.

2688
01:53:04,200 --> 01:53:06,360
The Doki Cinematic Universe.

2689
01:53:08,060 --> 01:53:09,740
So some of you guys might have been...

2690
01:53:11,020 --> 01:53:14,160
Some of you guys might have been confused about like...

2691
01:53:14,160 --> 01:53:19,720
Oh, where... I had this outfit shown around... in like different assets.

2692
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:22,840
So like my B-Rite back screen has that outfit on.

2693
01:53:22,940 --> 01:53:23,780
So you guys might have been like...

2694
01:53:23,780 --> 01:53:25,000
Where did that one come from?

2695
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:26,980
But that was what could have been.

2696
01:53:28,020 --> 01:53:29,020
What could have been.

2697
01:53:29,140 --> 01:53:32,140
And then there was Ito-san and there was gonna be like flowers coming out.

2698
01:53:32,260 --> 01:53:32,920
And like...

2699
01:53:34,820 --> 01:53:37,020
And then Question might be like...

2700
01:53:37,900 --> 01:53:39,580
But instead of that I get like...

2701
01:53:43,220 --> 01:53:43,660
So...

2702
01:53:43,660 --> 01:53:47,840
And then we can have the little bunnies can like ride along in incognito mode.

2703
01:53:47,920 --> 01:53:49,320
Because they... people will think they're just bags.

2704
01:53:49,660 --> 01:53:50,500
But no, no, no!

2705
01:53:51,020 --> 01:53:52,520
I don't know what they are but...

2706
01:53:52,520 --> 01:53:54,980
At least people will be freaked out about...

2707
01:53:54,980 --> 01:53:55,600
them moving.

2708
01:53:56,520 --> 01:53:59,040
So yeah, that was what could have been guys.

2709
01:53:59,140 --> 01:53:59,980
What could have been.

2710
01:54:01,020 --> 01:54:02,860
And we have a few more slides left.

2711
01:54:03,080 --> 01:54:04,160
We have a few more slides left.

2712
01:54:04,500 --> 01:54:05,860
So after that...

2713
01:54:05,860 --> 01:54:06,800
After that...

2714
01:54:07,600 --> 01:54:09,880
Well, I'm gonna talk about the different...

2715
01:54:09,880 --> 01:54:13,640
Let's just look back at the different merch I've got of myself.

2716
01:54:14,180 --> 01:54:16,340
That I solely own because I'm a narcissist.

2717
01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:17,640
I'm a narcissist!

2718
01:54:18,780 --> 01:54:19,940
What can I say?

2719
01:54:20,160 --> 01:54:22,020
I love to hug a pillow of myself.

2720
01:54:22,380 --> 01:54:24,220
A little tiny pillow of myself.

2721
01:54:24,220 --> 01:54:26,300
There's only one that exists.

2722
01:54:26,760 --> 01:54:29,400
There's only one that exists out of all of these.

2723
01:54:30,420 --> 01:54:31,900
I also have a paper puppet.

2724
01:54:32,040 --> 01:54:32,840
This was done...

2725
01:54:32,840 --> 01:54:37,980
This paper puppet was done during my 1.0 outfit.

2726
01:54:38,420 --> 01:54:39,620
So it was a while ago.

2727
01:54:39,940 --> 01:54:40,860
The person...

2728
01:54:40,860 --> 01:54:42,320
I'm trying to remember his name.

2729
01:54:42,660 --> 01:54:43,100
But...

2730
01:54:43,900 --> 01:54:44,600
But he...

2731
01:54:44,600 --> 01:54:45,900
It was before he like blew up.

2732
01:54:45,960 --> 01:54:46,540
So it was very...

2733
01:54:46,540 --> 01:54:48,640
It was like he wasn't like super popular back then.

2734
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:49,220
It was like...

2735
01:54:49,220 --> 01:54:50,140
It was 1.0.

2736
01:54:50,160 --> 01:54:53,240
So it was around like 2018, 2019.

2737
01:54:54,040 --> 01:54:54,860
Ish era.

2738
01:54:55,680 --> 01:54:58,840
So I was very fortunate to get one from him.

2739
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:00,140
Yeah, it's like...

2740
01:55:00,140 --> 01:55:00,680
It is...

2741
01:55:00,680 --> 01:55:03,380
There's a video of it I posted on Twitter somewhere.

2742
01:55:03,480 --> 01:55:04,300
I don't remember.

2743
01:55:04,480 --> 01:55:04,760
But...

2744
01:55:04,760 --> 01:55:06,280
It's somewhere out there.

2745
01:55:06,500 --> 01:55:07,780
It's somewhere out there.

2746
01:55:10,400 --> 01:55:11,360
And now...

2747
01:55:11,360 --> 01:55:11,980
You got so many...

2748
01:55:11,980 --> 01:55:13,760
Yeah, I got so many around that time.

2749
01:55:14,060 --> 01:55:15,440
Because I didn't know what to do.

2750
01:55:16,440 --> 01:55:17,400
I mean...

2751
01:55:17,400 --> 01:55:19,180
I love myself so much.

2752
01:55:19,540 --> 01:55:20,920
I just wanted so much.

2753
01:55:21,140 --> 01:55:21,500
I don't know.

2754
01:55:21,620 --> 01:55:22,100
I don't know.

2755
01:55:22,320 --> 01:55:22,800
I don't know.

2756
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:23,220
I don't know.

2757
01:55:24,680 --> 01:55:25,120
I love myself.

2758
01:55:25,120 --> 01:55:26,420
And then after that, it's...

2759
01:55:27,200 --> 01:55:28,900
Some of the little figures of myself.

2760
01:55:28,980 --> 01:55:32,080
Some of the little mini-me's of myself to look around.

2761
01:55:32,300 --> 01:55:33,580
So these are like little mini figures.

2762
01:55:33,960 --> 01:55:35,100
All of these are like...

2763
01:55:35,100 --> 01:55:36,300
Other than the acrylic stand.

2764
01:55:36,620 --> 01:55:37,840
The acrylic stand on the right.

2765
01:55:38,280 --> 01:55:39,960
That is given...

2766
01:55:39,960 --> 01:55:42,020
I think Ninja will have, will get the...

2767
01:55:42,020 --> 01:55:43,520
Because I only have two in the world.

2768
01:55:43,740 --> 01:55:45,880
I have two copies of this.

2769
01:55:46,060 --> 01:55:51,000
And one is for me and the extra one will be going to Ninja for his donation to the charity.

2770
01:55:51,040 --> 01:55:51,520
And then...

2771
01:55:51,520 --> 01:55:53,020
And then Foodbanks of Canada charity.

2772
01:55:53,040 --> 01:55:53,200
That's...

2773
01:56:01,820 --> 01:56:06,280
Ruby, thank you for giving us all the Sloth Guy!

2774
01:56:06,760 --> 01:56:07,400
Thank you!

2775
01:56:07,700 --> 01:56:12,840
Can we get some Bargnights really quick for Sloth Guy?

2776
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:13,860
Thank you, thank you.

2777
01:56:13,960 --> 01:56:15,680
And Ruby for giving us all.

2778
01:56:15,780 --> 01:56:16,720
Thank you so much!

2779
01:56:17,340 --> 01:56:18,400
Thank you everyone!

2780
01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:20,140
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

2781
01:56:20,780 --> 01:56:22,180
I really do appreciate it.

2782
01:56:22,260 --> 01:56:22,760
Thank you guys.

2783
01:56:22,900 --> 01:56:23,820
It does mean a lot.

2784
01:56:23,980 --> 01:56:24,440
Thank you.

2785
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:27,560
But yeah, they're really cute.

2786
01:56:27,660 --> 01:56:30,260
I think the one in the middle is done by Claypuffs.

2787
01:56:30,920 --> 01:56:37,540
The one in the right is done by... let me look... I should have wrote down the names.

2788
01:56:38,160 --> 01:56:39,080
But I was in a rush.

2789
01:56:39,120 --> 01:56:40,640
I did this PowerPoint today, by the way.

2790
01:56:42,940 --> 01:56:44,920
But everyone's done by Spacethumb.

2791
01:56:44,940 --> 01:56:46,880
So all of them, I retweeted them.

2792
01:56:48,360 --> 01:56:51,240
I retweeted the artists too, of them, on Twitter.

2793
01:56:51,660 --> 01:56:56,160
And the last one to the left is done by Korean Figure Artist.

2794
01:56:57,140 --> 01:56:59,060
He's like... I don't know.

2795
01:56:59,640 --> 01:57:02,260
He's been gone on the internet for a while.

2796
01:57:02,680 --> 01:57:07,120
So... I think he got drafted into the Korean Army.

2797
01:57:07,420 --> 01:57:09,860
So that's why he's been inactive.

2798
01:57:10,060 --> 01:57:11,480
Yeah, he painted it on stream too.

2799
01:57:11,720 --> 01:57:14,040
He painted it on stream and everything.

2800
01:57:14,240 --> 01:57:15,120
It was so fun to watch.

2801
01:57:15,220 --> 01:57:16,060
I think I raided him.

2802
01:57:16,060 --> 01:57:19,100
I raided him while he was working on the figure.

2803
01:57:20,160 --> 01:57:20,960
It was great.

2804
01:57:21,220 --> 01:57:22,880
He's with your twin.

2805
01:57:24,840 --> 01:57:27,880
Also, BigDuck, thank you so much for gifting a sub to Lurker.

2806
01:57:28,560 --> 01:57:29,540
Thank you, thank you.

2807
01:57:29,640 --> 01:57:31,200
I really do appreciate it.

2808
01:57:31,220 --> 01:57:31,640
Thank you.

2809
01:57:31,820 --> 01:57:33,640
Can we get some more Park Nights in chat?

2810
01:57:33,680 --> 01:57:34,420
Also, hey, Next.

2811
01:57:34,840 --> 01:57:35,700
Thank you, thank you.

2812
01:57:36,180 --> 01:57:40,360
Can we get some more Park Nights in chat for BigDuck for gifting a sub to Lurker?

2813
01:57:40,660 --> 01:57:41,740
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2814
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:42,780
Thank you, guys.

2815
01:57:42,940 --> 01:57:43,740
I really do appreciate it.

2816
01:57:43,740 --> 01:57:44,180
Hey, Seri.

2817
01:57:44,180 --> 01:57:46,840
Alright, the last two slides.

2818
01:57:46,940 --> 01:57:48,520
We have two more slides left, guys.

2819
01:57:48,760 --> 01:57:50,040
Two more slides left.

2820
01:57:50,380 --> 01:57:54,320
So, after this, let's talk about the merch.

2821
01:57:56,600 --> 01:57:58,320
The merch that we had.

2822
01:57:58,480 --> 01:58:01,260
Our little shop that we opened for 30 weeks.

2823
01:58:01,480 --> 01:58:11,460
I just want to say thank you again for all of you guys for pre-ordering the merch for these.

2824
01:58:11,680 --> 01:58:14,160
Like, I honestly did not expect it.

2825
01:58:14,180 --> 01:58:15,520
I didn't expect to get as many as I thought I did.

2826
01:58:16,460 --> 01:58:21,820
In my head, I thought that I was going to get 20 at best.

2827
01:58:22,380 --> 01:58:24,540
I was going to get 20 orders.

2828
01:58:24,720 --> 01:58:26,560
And that was me, like, aiming high.

2829
01:58:26,880 --> 01:58:31,560
That was me being like, oh, I'll be lucky if I get 20.

2830
01:58:31,920 --> 01:58:34,160
And I actually thought that.

2831
01:58:34,280 --> 01:58:35,560
I actually thought that.

2832
01:58:37,760 --> 01:58:43,960
And then, I even, like, when I opened pre-orders, I was like, hmm.

2833
01:58:44,020 --> 01:58:44,160
And then, I even, like, when I opened pre-orders, I was like, hmm.

2834
01:58:44,160 --> 01:58:51,960
If I just order 20 now, maybe I can, like, as I open the pre-orders, I was like, oh.

2835
01:58:52,200 --> 01:58:56,740
And if I order 20 now, maybe I can get them before my final stream.

2836
01:58:57,180 --> 01:58:59,300
And so, I did that.

2837
01:58:59,400 --> 01:59:03,000
And then, you guys, you guys, 50 orders.

2838
01:59:03,220 --> 01:59:05,120
I got 50 orders in the end.

2839
01:59:05,180 --> 01:59:06,740
I actually couldn't believe it.

2840
01:59:06,780 --> 01:59:11,960
And while you ordered the big bundle, too, I was like, oh my god.

2841
01:59:12,260 --> 01:59:13,200
So, I kept, like...

2842
01:59:13,200 --> 01:59:16,280
At first, when I hit, like, 30, I, like, um...

2843
01:59:16,280 --> 01:59:18,960
I, like, DM'd the manufacturer.

2844
01:59:19,080 --> 01:59:22,440
And I was like, hey, about that 20 orders, can you add, like, 10 more?

2845
01:59:22,920 --> 01:59:24,160
Like, 15 more?

2846
01:59:24,280 --> 01:59:26,220
And then, we all must rob a big review.

2847
01:59:29,300 --> 01:59:32,300
So, I was like, I was like, oh, shit.

2848
01:59:32,540 --> 01:59:34,480
I was like, can you put, like, 15 more?

2849
01:59:34,540 --> 01:59:36,620
Like, there's no way I'm going to get above 35.

2850
01:59:37,100 --> 01:59:37,860
There's no way.

2851
01:59:38,220 --> 01:59:39,880
And then, we went to 50.

2852
01:59:40,500 --> 01:59:42,400
And I had to contact them again.

2853
01:59:42,400 --> 01:59:44,060
And I was like, hey, about that.

2854
01:59:44,200 --> 01:59:44,900
I have more.

2855
01:59:45,060 --> 01:59:46,540
I have to order more.

2856
01:59:48,460 --> 01:59:50,700
I was like, there's no way I'm going to get above 35.

2857
01:59:51,240 --> 01:59:55,740
And I'm like, hey, I need, like, 15 more.

2858
01:59:57,480 --> 01:59:58,480
So, I kept...

2859
01:59:58,480 --> 02:00:01,020
The shipping for it kept getting pushed back.

2860
02:00:01,080 --> 02:00:02,280
And, um...

2861
02:00:02,280 --> 02:00:04,100
It kept getting pushed further and further.

2862
02:00:04,380 --> 02:00:07,040
Because I was supposed to get shipped, like, two weeks ago.

2863
02:00:07,300 --> 02:00:09,540
And it's because I kept adding more inventory.

2864
02:00:09,540 --> 02:00:12,580
That it got pushed back to, like, next...

2865
02:00:12,580 --> 02:00:14,420
Like, it's going to get shipped to me next week.

2866
02:00:14,640 --> 02:00:15,420
But don't worry.

2867
02:00:15,480 --> 02:00:18,420
I gave them the address to the Motel 6 that I'm going to be living in.

2868
02:00:18,580 --> 02:00:19,820
So, do not worry, Chad.

2869
02:00:19,960 --> 02:00:20,540
Do not worry.

2870
02:00:20,780 --> 02:00:26,280
And if I get internet service, maybe I'll try and post a little sneak picture.

2871
02:00:26,580 --> 02:00:27,180
Don't worry.

2872
02:00:27,240 --> 02:00:28,080
They won't know where I am.

2873
02:00:28,220 --> 02:00:30,740
There's 20,000 Motel 6s in the world.

2874
02:00:33,140 --> 02:00:34,880
I'll go to Motel 7.

2875
02:00:39,540 --> 02:00:40,520
Oh, my gosh.

2876
02:00:40,520 --> 02:00:43,420
Will, thank you so much for the three months of Tier 1.

2877
02:00:43,820 --> 02:00:44,740
Can we get some birthnights?

2878
02:00:45,120 --> 02:00:46,400
Real quick for Will.

2879
02:00:46,540 --> 02:00:46,940
Thank you.

2880
02:00:46,980 --> 02:00:47,380
Thank you.

2881
02:00:47,520 --> 02:00:48,180
Thank you.

2882
02:00:48,180 --> 02:00:49,380
I really do appreciate it.

2883
02:00:49,420 --> 02:00:50,500
Thank you so much.

2884
02:00:51,080 --> 02:00:52,020
Thank you, guys.

2885
02:00:52,260 --> 02:00:52,640
Thank you.

2886
02:00:52,680 --> 02:00:52,980
Thank you.

2887
02:00:53,020 --> 02:00:53,400
Thank you.

2888
02:00:54,320 --> 02:00:56,040
I really do appreciate it, guys.

2889
02:00:56,120 --> 02:00:59,860
Thank you so much for the support for this final stream.

2890
02:01:00,020 --> 02:01:00,480
It's hot.

2891
02:01:01,060 --> 02:01:03,200
We're almost getting closer to the end, guys.

2892
02:01:03,280 --> 02:01:07,840
There's, like, two more things left on my little list of things I want to do for my final stream.

2893
02:01:08,060 --> 02:01:08,920
And we're getting there.

2894
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:09,540
We're getting there.

2895
02:01:09,540 --> 02:01:10,900
Oh, my gosh.

2896
02:01:10,940 --> 02:01:11,220
Yeah!

2897
02:01:13,880 --> 02:01:15,220
Thank you, everyone.

2898
02:01:15,800 --> 02:01:16,920
Oh, my gosh.

2899
02:01:16,940 --> 02:01:18,260
Let me hydrate for that.

2900
02:01:18,520 --> 02:01:19,660
Let me...

2901
02:01:22,660 --> 02:01:23,180
Okay.

2902
02:01:24,660 --> 02:01:29,960
According to all knowns of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly.

2903
02:01:30,240 --> 02:01:34,740
Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.

2904
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:39,520
The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think of them.

2905
02:01:39,520 --> 02:01:40,020
It's impossible.

2906
02:01:40,360 --> 02:01:44,000
Yellow, black, yellow, black, yellow, black, yellow, black.

2907
02:01:44,100 --> 02:01:45,500
Oh, black and yellow.

2908
02:01:45,820 --> 02:01:47,100
Let's shake it up a little.

2909
02:01:47,460 --> 02:01:47,760
Barry!

2910
02:01:48,100 --> 02:01:49,260
Breakfast is ready.

2911
02:01:49,540 --> 02:01:50,000
Coming!

2912
02:01:50,320 --> 02:01:51,440
Hang on a second.

2913
02:01:51,560 --> 02:01:51,900
Hello?

2914
02:01:52,240 --> 02:01:52,800
Barry!

2915
02:01:53,180 --> 02:01:53,740
Adam?

2916
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:55,800
Can you believe this is happening?

2917
02:01:55,960 --> 02:01:57,020
I can't!

2918
02:01:57,020 --> 02:01:58,080
I'll pick you up.

2919
02:01:58,120 --> 02:01:58,720
Looking...

2920
02:01:58,720 --> 02:01:59,100
Shock!

2921
02:01:59,460 --> 02:02:00,000
Arp!

2922
02:02:01,300 --> 02:02:02,300
Use the stairs!

2923
02:02:02,520 --> 02:02:04,340
Your father paid good money for those.

2924
02:02:04,620 --> 02:02:05,160
Sorry!

2925
02:02:05,260 --> 02:02:06,200
I'm excited!

2926
02:02:06,400 --> 02:02:07,440
Here's the graduate!

2927
02:02:07,540 --> 02:02:09,140
We're very proud of you, son!

2928
02:02:09,140 --> 02:02:11,040
A perfect report card!

2929
02:02:11,200 --> 02:02:11,820
All bees!

2930
02:02:12,320 --> 02:02:13,160
Very proud!

2931
02:02:13,640 --> 02:02:13,980
Mom!

2932
02:02:14,320 --> 02:02:15,760
I got a thing going here!

2933
02:02:16,100 --> 02:02:17,520
You got lint in your fuzz!

2934
02:02:17,660 --> 02:02:17,940
Oh!

2935
02:02:18,140 --> 02:02:18,840
That's me!

2936
02:02:19,140 --> 02:02:20,000
Wait to us!

2937
02:02:20,140 --> 02:02:22,700
We'll be in row 118,000!

2938
02:02:22,960 --> 02:02:23,240
Bye!

2939
02:02:23,680 --> 02:02:24,960
Barry, I told you!

2940
02:02:25,020 --> 02:02:26,220
Stop flying in the house!

2941
02:02:26,480 --> 02:02:27,200
Hey, Adam!

2942
02:02:27,480 --> 02:02:28,280
Hey, Barry!

2943
02:02:28,400 --> 02:02:29,500
Oh, fuck you guys!

2944
02:02:31,940 --> 02:02:34,380
Is that fuzz dough?

2945
02:02:34,640 --> 02:02:35,240
A little!

2946
02:02:35,580 --> 02:02:36,500
Special day!

2947
02:02:37,040 --> 02:02:37,600
Graduation!

2948
02:02:37,740 --> 02:02:39,020
Never thought I'd make it!

2949
02:02:39,100 --> 02:02:39,120
Oh, my God!

2950
02:02:39,120 --> 02:02:42,280
Three days grade school, three days high school!

2951
02:02:42,460 --> 02:02:43,580
Those were...

2952
02:02:43,580 --> 02:02:44,620
Rage!

2953
02:02:44,920 --> 02:02:48,100
I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive!

2954
02:02:48,260 --> 02:02:49,560
You did come back different!

2955
02:02:50,020 --> 02:02:50,740
Hi, Barry!

2956
02:02:51,140 --> 02:02:51,700
Artie?

2957
02:02:51,880 --> 02:02:52,860
Growing a mustache?

2958
02:02:53,360 --> 02:02:54,100
Looks good!

2959
02:02:54,400 --> 02:02:55,380
Hear about Frankie?

2960
02:02:55,640 --> 02:02:56,100
Yeah.

2961
02:02:56,260 --> 02:02:57,220
You going to the funeral?

2962
02:02:57,500 --> 02:02:58,940
No, I'm not going.

2963
02:02:59,240 --> 02:03:01,620
Everybody knows, sting someone, you die!

2964
02:03:01,960 --> 02:03:03,400
Don't waste it on a squirrel!

2965
02:03:03,720 --> 02:03:04,960
Such a hothead!

2966
02:03:05,860 --> 02:03:08,100
I guess he could've gotten out the way.

2967
02:03:08,460 --> 02:03:09,100
I don't know.

2968
02:03:09,120 --> 02:03:09,540
I love this.

2969
02:03:09,620 --> 02:03:11,780
Incorporating amusement park into your day?

2970
02:03:11,980 --> 02:03:13,520
That's why we don't need vaccinations!

2971
02:03:14,120 --> 02:03:14,480
Boy!

2972
02:03:14,740 --> 02:03:16,980
Quite a bit of pomp under the circumstances!

2973
02:03:17,420 --> 02:03:18,600
Well, Adam!

2974
02:03:18,960 --> 02:03:20,780
Today we are men!

2975
02:03:21,220 --> 02:03:21,920
We are!

2976
02:03:22,180 --> 02:03:23,040
Bee men!

2977
02:03:23,300 --> 02:03:23,700
Amen!

2978
02:03:24,140 --> 02:03:24,620
Hallelujah!

2979
02:03:25,220 --> 02:03:25,800
Students?

2980
02:03:26,100 --> 02:03:26,580
Faculty!

2981
02:03:27,080 --> 02:03:28,180
Distinguished Bees!

2982
02:03:28,260 --> 02:03:30,360
Please welcome, Dean Boswell!

2983
02:03:30,520 --> 02:03:31,100
Welcome!

2984
02:03:31,400 --> 02:03:34,000
New High City graduating class of 1915!

2985
02:03:34,260 --> 02:03:38,080
That concludes our ceremony and begins your career at Honex Industry!

2986
02:03:38,440 --> 02:03:39,020
Welcome!

2987
02:03:39,040 --> 02:03:39,100
Dean Boswell!

2988
02:03:39,120 --> 02:03:40,460
We pick our job today?

2989
02:03:40,740 --> 02:03:42,200
I heard it's just orientation!

2990
02:03:43,300 --> 02:03:44,120
Hands up!

2991
02:03:44,240 --> 02:03:45,140
Here we go!

2992
02:03:45,440 --> 02:03:48,680
Keep your hands on talent and sign on talent all times!

2993
02:03:49,140 --> 02:03:50,500
Wonder what it'll be like?

2994
02:03:50,660 --> 02:03:51,360
A little scary.

2995
02:03:51,740 --> 02:03:55,980
Welcome to Honex, a division of Hone's Cone and a part of the Hexagon Group!

2996
02:03:58,160 --> 02:03:58,680
Up!

2997
02:03:58,720 --> 02:03:59,660
This is it!

2998
02:04:03,100 --> 02:04:07,000
You have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work your whole life!

2999
02:04:07,320 --> 02:04:12,200
Honey begins when our valley and pond jogs bring the net critter to the height!

3000
02:04:12,360 --> 02:04:12,380
We are the best!

3001
02:04:12,380 --> 02:04:12,900
We are the best!

3002
02:04:12,900 --> 02:04:24,080
Our top secret formula is automatically color corrected, sign adjusted, and bubble contoured into the soothing sweet syrup of its distinctive golden glow you know as Honey!

3003
02:04:24,380 --> 02:04:25,860
That girl was hot!

3004
02:04:26,080 --> 02:04:27,240
She's my cousin!

3005
02:04:27,560 --> 02:04:28,380
She is?

3006
02:04:28,600 --> 02:04:30,080
Yeah we're all cousins!

3007
02:04:30,600 --> 02:04:31,340
Right, you're right.

3008
02:04:31,460 --> 02:04:38,680
As Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of eating existence.

3009
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:42,360
The Bees are stress testing a new helmet technology.

3010
02:04:42,360 --> 02:04:42,900
Technology.

3011
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:44,500
What do you think he makes?

3012
02:04:44,520 --> 02:04:45,180
Not enough.

3013
02:04:45,560 --> 02:04:48,260
Here we have our latest investment, the Kremlin.

3014
02:04:48,560 --> 02:04:49,820
What does that do?

3015
02:04:50,120 --> 02:04:52,760
Catches that little shroom of money that hangs out the port.

3016
02:04:53,120 --> 02:04:54,260
Saves us millions.

3017
02:04:54,700 --> 02:04:56,460
Can anyone work on the Kremlin?

3018
02:04:56,680 --> 02:04:57,180
Of course!

3019
02:04:57,520 --> 02:05:00,280
Most bee jobs are small ones.

3020
02:05:00,540 --> 02:05:07,300
But bees know what every small job, if it's not well, means a lot.

3021
02:05:08,100 --> 02:05:15,880
But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job constantly trying to improve every aspect of bee existence.

3022
02:05:16,360 --> 02:05:19,180
These bees are stress testing a new helmet technology.

3023
02:05:19,780 --> 02:05:21,200
What do you think he makes?

3024
02:05:21,380 --> 02:05:22,120
Not enough.

3025
02:05:22,420 --> 02:05:26,300
Here we have our latest investment, the Kremlin.

3026
02:05:26,500 --> 02:05:27,680
What does that do?

3027
02:05:27,980 --> 02:05:30,660
Catches that little shroom of money that hangs out the port.

3028
02:05:31,020 --> 02:05:32,160
Saves us millions.

3029
02:05:32,520 --> 02:05:34,040
Can anyone work on the Kremlin?

3030
02:05:34,240 --> 02:05:34,680
Of course!

3031
02:05:35,060 --> 02:05:36,940
Most bee jobs are small ones.

3032
02:05:41,120 --> 02:05:45,360
Okay, I'm closing the... I'm closing her damn...

3033
02:05:47,680 --> 02:05:49,820
You guys went too far.

3034
02:05:50,160 --> 02:05:51,840
You guys went too far.

3035
02:05:55,760 --> 02:05:57,680
It just kept going.

3036
02:05:57,800 --> 02:05:59,060
I'm closing it.

3037
02:06:02,720 --> 02:06:03,920
Too much.

3038
02:06:03,980 --> 02:06:05,140
It's too much.

3039
02:06:07,920 --> 02:06:10,360
I was like, no more.

3040
02:06:10,360 --> 02:06:11,540
No more.

3041
02:06:12,760 --> 02:06:15,760
Now no one has channel points.

3042
02:06:20,900 --> 02:06:24,520
Now no one has channel points anymore.

3043
02:06:34,900 --> 02:06:38,360
Think about your actions now.

3044
02:06:42,360 --> 02:06:46,540
I have... in the end, this was the heist all along.

3045
02:06:47,250 --> 02:06:49,580
This was the heist all along, guys.

3046
02:06:55,810 --> 02:07:00,350
This was the... this was the true heist all along, guys.

3047
02:07:03,630 --> 02:07:07,670
The true and final heist to end all heists.

3048
02:07:07,890 --> 02:07:09,850
To end all heists.

3049
02:07:12,190 --> 02:07:12,890
Alright.

3050
02:07:14,210 --> 02:07:18,170
Because of this, I will read all the other ones that we had left.

3051
02:07:18,490 --> 02:07:22,190
I will... I will read the rest of it.

3052
02:07:26,130 --> 02:07:27,550
Oh my god.

3053
02:07:27,810 --> 02:07:30,110
Like, I don't even know where I was.

3054
02:07:30,670 --> 02:07:31,230
Alright.

3055
02:07:33,050 --> 02:07:33,610
Alright.

3056
02:07:33,750 --> 02:07:34,690
She's my cousin.

3057
02:07:34,850 --> 02:07:35,570
She is?

3058
02:07:35,810 --> 02:07:36,870
We're all cousins.

3059
02:07:37,050 --> 02:07:37,770
Right, you're right.

3060
02:07:37,970 --> 02:07:40,610
At Honux, we call me Popo.

3061
02:07:41,650 --> 02:07:43,750
We constantly strive to improve.

3062
02:07:43,750 --> 02:07:45,490
Through every aspect of bee assistance.

3063
02:07:45,950 --> 02:07:46,890
These bees...

3064
02:07:46,890 --> 02:07:48,090
Oh wait, am I reading this again?

3065
02:07:48,710 --> 02:07:49,310
Oh, she's not.

3066
02:07:50,210 --> 02:07:51,750
Let me skip the...

3067
02:07:51,750 --> 02:07:52,270
Wait.

3068
02:07:52,390 --> 02:07:52,830
Okay.

3069
02:07:52,970 --> 02:07:53,970
What do you think you make?

3070
02:07:54,090 --> 02:07:54,570
Not enough.

3071
02:07:55,690 --> 02:07:57,550
Well, here we have our latest...

3072
02:07:57,550 --> 02:07:58,750
Our latest...

3073
02:07:58,750 --> 02:07:59,590
Advancement.

3074
02:07:59,590 --> 02:08:00,050
The Kremlin.

3075
02:08:00,190 --> 02:08:00,970
What does he do?

3076
02:08:01,190 --> 02:08:04,490
Catches a little strand of honey that hangs after you.

3077
02:08:04,550 --> 02:08:05,870
Pour it and saves us millions.

3078
02:08:06,330 --> 02:08:08,030
Can anyone work from the Kremlin?

3079
02:08:08,210 --> 02:08:08,690
Of course.

3080
02:08:08,910 --> 02:08:10,910
Most bee jobs are small ones.

3081
02:08:11,150 --> 02:08:13,730
But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, will be worth it.

3082
02:08:13,730 --> 02:08:14,910
Well, it means a lot.

3083
02:08:15,110 --> 02:08:19,350
But choose carefully, because you'll stay in the job today.

3084
02:08:19,510 --> 02:08:20,810
I heard it's just orientation.

3085
02:08:21,350 --> 02:08:22,030
Heads up.

3086
02:08:22,050 --> 02:08:22,650
Here we go.

3087
02:08:22,970 --> 02:08:26,410
Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.

3088
02:08:26,550 --> 02:08:27,650
When it'll be like...

3089
02:08:27,650 --> 02:08:28,310
A little scary.

3090
02:08:28,710 --> 02:08:29,830
Welcome to Honux.

3091
02:08:29,890 --> 02:08:31,090
A division of Hon's Cone.

3092
02:08:31,210 --> 02:08:32,770
And a part of the Hexagon Group.

3093
02:08:32,990 --> 02:08:33,690
This is it.

3094
02:08:33,850 --> 02:08:34,170
Wow.

3095
02:08:34,370 --> 02:08:34,790
Wow.

3096
02:08:34,910 --> 02:08:41,850
We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.

3097
02:08:42,030 --> 02:08:43,710
Honey begins when our values are high.

3098
02:08:43,710 --> 02:08:46,110
And we get pollen drops to bring the nectar to the hive.

3099
02:08:46,290 --> 02:08:49,210
Our top secret formula is automatically color correct.

3100
02:08:49,910 --> 02:08:51,210
Today we are men.

3101
02:08:51,390 --> 02:08:52,010
We are men.

3102
02:08:52,190 --> 02:08:52,750
Bee men.

3103
02:08:52,950 --> 02:08:53,330
Amen.

3104
02:08:53,690 --> 02:08:54,090
Hallelujah.

3105
02:08:54,570 --> 02:08:55,090
Students.

3106
02:08:55,190 --> 02:08:55,750
Facilities.

3107
02:08:56,030 --> 02:08:56,590
Faculty.

3108
02:08:57,390 --> 02:08:57,930
Distinguished beings.

3109
02:08:58,270 --> 02:08:59,770
Please welcome Dean Busbell.

3110
02:08:59,890 --> 02:09:02,090
Welcome new hive graduating class of 1950.

3111
02:09:02,430 --> 02:09:03,890
That concludes our ceremonies.

3112
02:09:04,290 --> 02:09:06,270
And begins your career at Honux Industries.

3113
02:09:07,330 --> 02:09:08,830
Will we pick our job today?

3114
02:09:08,970 --> 02:09:10,150
I heard it's just orientation.

3115
02:09:10,650 --> 02:09:11,210
Heads up.

3116
02:09:11,290 --> 02:09:11,910
Here we go.

3117
02:09:12,090 --> 02:09:13,690
Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.

3118
02:09:15,210 --> 02:09:16,950
Wonder what it would be like.

3119
02:09:17,070 --> 02:09:17,790
A little scary.

3120
02:09:18,110 --> 02:09:18,990
Welcome Honux.

3121
02:09:19,110 --> 02:09:20,450
This is your institution of Hong Kong.

3122
02:09:20,490 --> 02:09:21,670
A part of the Hexagon Grow.

3123
02:09:24,270 --> 02:09:30,230
Reacted scent adjusted and bubble contoured into the soothing sweet syrup with a distinguished golden glow.

3124
02:09:30,890 --> 02:09:31,990
Known as honey.

3125
02:09:32,130 --> 02:09:33,070
That girl was hot.

3126
02:09:33,210 --> 02:09:34,010
She's my cousin.

3127
02:09:34,190 --> 02:09:34,690
She is?

3128
02:09:34,830 --> 02:09:35,830
Yes, we're all cousins.

3129
02:09:36,190 --> 02:09:36,530
Right.

3130
02:09:36,590 --> 02:09:37,010
You're right.

3131
02:09:37,370 --> 02:09:43,050
At Honux, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence.

3132
02:09:43,250 --> 02:09:43,670
They be bee, honey.

3133
02:09:43,690 --> 02:09:45,970
We are stress testing a new helmet technology.

3134
02:09:46,250 --> 02:09:47,370
What do you think he makes?

3135
02:09:47,490 --> 02:09:48,210
Not enough.

3136
02:09:48,490 --> 02:09:50,570
Here we have our latest advance with the Kremlin.

3137
02:09:50,750 --> 02:09:51,510
What does that do?

3138
02:09:51,610 --> 02:09:53,070
Catches a little strand of honey.

3139
02:09:53,650 --> 02:09:55,390
After you pour it, it saves us millions.

3140
02:09:55,450 --> 02:09:56,610
Can anyone work on the Kremlin?

3141
02:09:56,770 --> 02:09:57,210
Of course.

3142
02:09:57,390 --> 02:09:58,090
Must be.

3143
02:09:58,130 --> 02:09:59,650
Just know that every...

3144
02:09:59,650 --> 02:10:00,490
She's my cousin.

3145
02:10:00,710 --> 02:10:01,370
Your cousin?

3146
02:10:01,510 --> 02:10:02,130
We're all cousins.

3147
02:10:07,450 --> 02:10:08,730
Going in circles.

3148
02:10:09,550 --> 02:10:12,730
Oh, I can't remember reading the same part.

3149
02:10:13,190 --> 02:10:13,670
What is this?

3150
02:10:13,670 --> 02:10:14,810
I have to pull it out.

3151
02:10:15,610 --> 02:10:15,970
Yes, I have to pull it out.

3152
02:10:16,570 --> 02:10:18,450
Because people keep following.

3153
02:10:18,950 --> 02:10:24,820
So I kept reading the same thing over and over again.

3154
02:10:25,560 --> 02:10:27,040
Because I kept...

3155
02:10:30,330 --> 02:10:32,230
We're done here.

3156
02:10:32,490 --> 02:10:34,370
We remain on here.

3157
02:10:35,590 --> 02:10:37,070
You're all cousins.

3158
02:10:42,080 --> 02:10:43,560
Oh my god.

3159
02:10:44,860 --> 02:10:46,400
Oh my god.

3160
02:10:46,700 --> 02:10:48,280
I've been broken.

3161
02:10:48,440 --> 02:10:50,420
This is payback for the holiday.

3162
02:10:50,420 --> 02:10:50,440
Oh my god.

3163
02:10:55,940 --> 02:11:01,660
What do you mean I have to keep... I already finished it.

3164
02:11:01,720 --> 02:11:05,120
I just kept reading the same thing over and over again.

3165
02:11:05,500 --> 02:11:08,780
I already finished this like 20 million.

3166
02:11:10,320 --> 02:11:11,420
Wait, are you worried?

3167
02:11:11,480 --> 02:11:13,620
Alright, Flychan, where are we?

3168
02:11:13,880 --> 02:11:16,260
Flychan, there's so many.

3169
02:11:16,520 --> 02:11:17,900
I don't know which one's you.

3170
02:11:20,680 --> 02:11:21,880
Where is it?

3171
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:23,320
Wait, where is it?

3172
02:11:23,480 --> 02:11:25,180
I saw it.

3173
02:11:25,500 --> 02:11:26,720
What did you redeem?

3174
02:11:27,160 --> 02:11:27,660
No!

3175
02:11:29,720 --> 02:11:30,840
Alright, there we go.

3176
02:11:32,900 --> 02:11:33,400
Also,

3177
02:11:36,460 --> 02:11:40,820
Geek Girl, thank you for giving a 3 month tier 1 sub to Goh.

3178
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:44,740
And Look, thank you for subbing for 9 months at tier 1.

3179
02:11:45,040 --> 02:11:47,780
And Geek Girl, thank you for 2 months at tier 1.

3180
02:11:47,900 --> 02:11:48,980
Thank you, thank you!

3181
02:11:49,340 --> 02:11:51,580
Can I get some Barf Nights?

3182
02:11:52,840 --> 02:11:53,860
Or a little quick.

3183
02:11:55,840 --> 02:11:57,620
For all the subs.

3184
02:11:57,940 --> 02:11:59,300
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

3185
02:12:00,560 --> 02:12:01,620
Thank you everyone.

3186
02:12:02,380 --> 02:12:03,780
Thank you so much.

3187
02:12:03,880 --> 02:12:05,500
I really do appreciate it.

3188
02:12:05,540 --> 02:12:06,280
Thank you guys.

3189
02:12:06,580 --> 02:12:08,200
Thank you all so much.

3190
02:12:08,760 --> 02:12:09,860
Thank you everyone.

3191
02:12:10,200 --> 02:12:11,960
It really does mean a lot.

3192
02:12:12,220 --> 02:12:13,400
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

3193
02:12:14,580 --> 02:12:15,600
Thank you all!

3194
02:12:20,840 --> 02:12:22,040
Thank you so much!

3195
02:12:22,040 --> 02:12:26,280
You guys deserve, you guys deserve that for making me do the loop.

3196
02:12:26,380 --> 02:12:28,220
For making me do the loop.

3197
02:12:31,140 --> 02:12:32,520
It says they're open.

3198
02:12:34,520 --> 02:12:37,040
They seem exhausted for me.

3199
02:12:40,520 --> 02:12:44,000
You could have stopped and we all could have had our point.

3200
02:12:44,140 --> 02:12:44,820
But no!

3201
02:12:44,820 --> 02:12:45,100
No!

3202
02:12:45,180 --> 02:12:46,660
We're all cousins!

3203
02:12:55,780 --> 02:12:56,080
Alright.

3204
02:12:59,740 --> 02:13:01,820
Now we're all cousins!

3205
02:13:03,540 --> 02:13:04,320
Wait, what?

3206
02:13:04,320 --> 02:13:06,640
Yeah, you guys 100% touched the entire Instagram.

3207
02:13:08,280 --> 02:13:10,620
That was the final heist.

3208
02:13:10,680 --> 02:13:11,400
That was it!

3209
02:13:12,020 --> 02:13:13,720
Oswald, thank you for the sale!

3210
02:13:13,720 --> 02:13:14,680
Fuck yeah!

3211
02:13:16,740 --> 02:13:17,700
Joke's on you!

3212
02:13:18,040 --> 02:13:19,600
Chat's hiding your donation!

3213
02:13:19,600 --> 02:13:23,180
So I can't see the... I can't see what you wrote there!

3214
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:27,380
You mad lad!

3215
02:13:31,900 --> 02:13:33,440
Ah, the way of the thief.

3216
02:13:36,080 --> 02:13:40,820
But I knew what... I saw the aviation laws and I knew...

3217
02:13:40,820 --> 02:13:44,760
I saw the aviation laws poking at the top.

3218
02:13:45,900 --> 02:13:47,280
I can't believe it.

3219
02:13:47,360 --> 02:13:48,180
I still like that.

3220
02:13:51,380 --> 02:13:52,240
Oh my gosh.

3221
02:13:52,320 --> 02:13:53,440
Also, there's still one more slide.

3222
02:13:53,680 --> 02:13:56,000
The final heist is about to end.

3223
02:13:56,400 --> 02:13:57,180
But not yet!

3224
02:13:57,700 --> 02:13:58,780
It's almost close.

3225
02:13:58,920 --> 02:13:59,880
We have two more things.

3226
02:14:00,240 --> 02:14:01,360
We have two more things.

3227
02:14:01,440 --> 02:14:03,140
So one of the things I was gonna do...

3228
02:14:03,920 --> 02:14:06,860
One of the things I was gonna do is the...

3229
02:14:07,980 --> 02:14:08,900
Is the...

3230
02:14:10,280 --> 02:14:10,740
Marshmallows!

3231
02:14:10,920 --> 02:14:12,300
It's the marshmallows, guys.

3232
02:14:12,640 --> 02:14:14,760
You thought I forgot about the marshmallows?

3233
02:14:15,420 --> 02:14:16,860
So... Oh my god!

3234
02:14:18,180 --> 02:14:19,720
There's a lot of marshmallows!

3235
02:14:24,910 --> 02:14:26,620
I didn't think I would get this many.

3236
02:14:26,840 --> 02:14:27,880
I honestly...

3237
02:14:27,880 --> 02:14:28,900
Didn't.

3238
02:14:29,080 --> 02:14:29,940
Let's read them.

3239
02:14:29,980 --> 02:14:30,900
I will not cry!

3240
02:14:31,160 --> 02:14:31,880
I promise!

3241
02:14:32,340 --> 02:14:33,760
I won't cry, guys.

3242
02:14:34,120 --> 02:14:34,960
I won't.

3243
02:14:34,960 --> 02:14:36,120
I won't, guys.

3244
02:14:36,520 --> 02:14:37,380
I won't.

3245
02:14:41,260 --> 02:14:41,840
Oh...

3246
02:14:41,840 --> 02:14:44,080
Let me hydrate real quick before I...

3247
02:14:44,080 --> 02:14:45,940
Before I cry all...

3248
02:14:45,940 --> 02:14:47,460
Cry all of it out.

3249
02:14:47,460 --> 02:14:49,400
Before I cry all of it out.

3250
02:14:51,960 --> 02:14:52,840
I'm gonna try not to cry.

3251
02:14:52,960 --> 02:14:54,580
I'm gonna try not to cry, guys.

3252
02:14:56,380 --> 02:14:57,200
We're gonna...

3253
02:14:57,720 --> 02:14:59,940
We're gonna try not to cry, guys.

3254
02:15:01,980 --> 02:15:02,460
Alright.

3255
02:15:02,460 --> 02:15:02,940
Marshmallow.

3256
02:15:04,400 --> 02:15:04,880
Okay.

3257
02:15:04,880 --> 02:15:05,360
So...

3258
02:15:06,040 --> 02:15:07,200
So here's the marshmallow.

3259
02:15:07,200 --> 02:15:08,540
Let's read this together, chat.

3260
02:15:08,880 --> 02:15:10,520
Let's read these... I have to refresh it.

3261
02:15:11,040 --> 02:15:11,860
Alright, guys.

3262
02:15:13,220 --> 02:15:14,580
I'm trying not to cry!

3263
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:16,480
Alright.

3264
02:15:20,280 --> 02:15:20,760
Alright, guys.

3265
02:15:20,760 --> 02:15:21,120
Ahh, guys!

3266
02:15:22,080 --> 02:15:23,680
24... I didn't expect that many.

3267
02:15:24,060 --> 02:15:27,940
I didn't know what to say here, but it's only been a few weeks since I found you.

3268
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,100
I'm not good with words and I'm really shy.

3269
02:15:30,220 --> 02:15:33,200
So for me, it's so difficult to talk with people.

3270
02:15:33,380 --> 02:15:36,060
But I really enjoyed every stream this last weeks.

3271
02:15:36,300 --> 02:15:38,780
You really made me smile so many times.

3272
02:15:39,140 --> 02:15:41,760
All my problems disappear when you hear your laugh.

3273
02:15:41,920 --> 02:15:42,200
Ahhh!

3274
02:15:42,880 --> 02:15:43,260
Ahhh!

3275
02:15:45,760 --> 02:15:47,520
I'm really sad that you're graduating.

3276
02:15:47,780 --> 02:15:49,020
I'll miss watching you.

3277
02:15:49,120 --> 02:15:50,340
I'll miss the bark nights.

3278
02:15:50,600 --> 02:15:53,260
And I'll miss staying late and sleeping only one hour!

3279
02:15:53,600 --> 02:15:54,280
You're welcome!

3280
02:15:58,100 --> 02:15:59,460
Thank you, Doki.

3281
02:15:59,660 --> 02:16:00,540
Thank you!

3282
02:16:01,140 --> 02:16:03,560
Why did Rotten Tomato always felt left out?

3283
02:16:03,600 --> 02:16:05,180
Because he couldn't catch up.

3284
02:16:05,420 --> 02:16:06,100
Yeah, I know.

3285
02:16:06,160 --> 02:16:10,000
Finishing with tomato pun is not the best, but I really wanted to say it.

3286
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,300
Aww... It's okay!

3287
02:16:12,720 --> 02:16:16,620
My VODs are still... Well, my VODs on YouTube are still up!

3288
02:16:16,760 --> 02:16:17,720
Just listen to...

3289
02:16:18,720 --> 02:16:29,060
If you record it and put it in like... If you have a Doki Makura, record my laugh, put it in the Doki Makura, and then it's like I'm always there laughing at you.

3290
02:16:32,760 --> 02:16:33,320
With you.

3291
02:16:33,420 --> 02:16:34,040
With you.

3292
02:16:40,640 --> 02:16:43,340
Alright, let's go to the next... Please someone do it!

3293
02:16:43,540 --> 02:16:44,940
You're always laughing at me.

3294
02:16:45,340 --> 02:16:46,760
Aww, phantom!

3295
02:16:47,080 --> 02:16:48,080
That's really sweet.

3296
02:16:48,420 --> 02:16:50,160
That was a really sweet marshmallow.

3297
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:57,840
I'm not... I just met you, but it feels like I missed... It's okay as long as like you were there now before I was gone.

3298
02:16:57,960 --> 02:16:59,160
You were there when I was alive.

3299
02:16:59,840 --> 02:17:00,800
When I was live.

3300
02:17:01,100 --> 02:17:02,220
I'm always alive.

3301
02:17:06,440 --> 02:17:09,300
I'm not great with words, or at least emotional ones.

3302
02:17:09,300 --> 02:17:13,980
Your streams have helped me keep me sane through the ups and mostly downs of my life for the past two years.

3303
02:17:14,180 --> 02:17:16,620
Thanks for being the coolest burp.

3304
02:17:18,420 --> 02:17:20,020
No, thank you guys.

3305
02:17:20,300 --> 02:17:23,760
It really... You know, you guys also cheer me up so much too.

3306
02:17:23,820 --> 02:17:29,940
Whenever I have like a bad day, um, and then I would be like, should I really stream?

3307
02:17:30,020 --> 02:17:31,560
No, I feel like shit right now.

3308
02:17:31,680 --> 02:17:36,700
And as soon as I turn the stream on, I just feel so much better hanging out with you guys, just talking.

3309
02:17:36,780 --> 02:17:38,540
I think this is only, um...

3310
02:17:39,520 --> 02:17:42,800
This is why I always do a lot of chatting streams too.

3311
02:17:43,280 --> 02:17:46,500
Definitely I do a lot of like chatting streams and a lot of just like chilling.

3312
02:17:46,680 --> 02:17:49,180
Like, you guys like know to see how my art stream is mostly me talking.

3313
02:17:49,380 --> 02:17:50,660
Because I love talking to you guys.

3314
02:17:50,700 --> 02:17:52,820
I love talking with the community and just like hanging out.

3315
02:17:52,940 --> 02:17:57,160
And have you enabled my dumbass... dumbass chaotic lives.

3316
02:17:57,600 --> 02:17:58,000
Like...

3317
02:18:01,180 --> 02:18:02,700
You guys enabled me.

3318
02:18:03,300 --> 02:18:05,220
And it makes me happy.

3319
02:18:05,460 --> 02:18:06,560
It makes me happy.

3320
02:18:06,660 --> 02:18:07,500
But thank you guys.

3321
02:18:07,720 --> 02:18:09,280
So you guys do as much as you want.

3322
02:18:09,280 --> 02:18:11,300
As much as I do for you guys.

3323
02:18:11,740 --> 02:18:15,480
You guys make me happy and I'm happy that I make you guys happy.

3324
02:18:18,680 --> 02:18:19,460
Doki-chan!

3325
02:18:19,840 --> 02:18:25,860
I wanna say thank you so much for bringing me smiles, laughter, and lots of warmth for so long.

3326
02:18:26,140 --> 02:18:30,260
You really do brighten up my day and made me believe that I could be the best that I can be.

3327
02:18:30,580 --> 02:18:36,660
I don't know if my words will reach you in time, but just know that not a day goes by without me thinking of you.

3328
02:18:36,680 --> 02:18:38,260
And I give you all my wonderful wishes.

3329
02:18:38,260 --> 02:18:40,720
You stole my heart the day I crossed paths with you.

3330
02:18:40,800 --> 02:18:46,620
And although I'm quiet in the lurking shadows, I've witnessed an amazing growth of love and passion in the passage of time.

3331
02:18:47,020 --> 02:18:51,720
I'll feel empty about you by our side, but know that you changed our lives for the better.

3332
02:18:51,960 --> 02:18:55,480
Please remember us whenever you are and remember the love that you shared with us.

3333
02:18:55,520 --> 02:18:56,580
We will always share back.

3334
02:18:56,780 --> 02:18:57,700
X a thousand.

3335
02:18:58,060 --> 02:18:59,500
Thank you for inspiring me.

3336
02:18:59,540 --> 02:19:03,600
Thank you for all the wonderful things that you shared with us through this team.

3337
02:19:03,860 --> 02:19:07,680
I'll always admire and look up to you as an artist, as a community leader, and a creator.

3338
02:19:07,680 --> 02:19:11,600
We will always stay as a loyal Fortnite through and through.

3339
02:19:11,920 --> 02:19:13,420
Oh my god.

3340
02:19:15,400 --> 02:19:16,440
I'm not crying.

3341
02:19:17,540 --> 02:19:19,860
I'm holding it in till the end.

3342
02:19:20,160 --> 02:19:20,780
Guys.

3343
02:19:20,840 --> 02:19:22,080
Oh gosh.

3344
02:19:26,460 --> 02:19:28,420
That was so sweet.

3345
02:19:28,760 --> 02:19:30,220
That was so sweet.

3346
02:19:30,420 --> 02:19:31,940
Whoever wrote that one.

3347
02:19:33,900 --> 02:19:35,560
But no, like I said.

3348
02:19:35,980 --> 02:19:38,100
You guys make me so happy too.

3349
02:19:38,220 --> 02:19:39,080
You guys do.

3350
02:19:39,400 --> 02:19:40,200
You guys do.

3351
02:19:40,220 --> 02:19:44,340
I think this is also why I do not collaborate a lot too.

3352
02:19:44,440 --> 02:19:50,260
I feel like I'm one of the few, like one of the VTubers that don't really do a lot of collaboration streams.

3353
02:19:50,440 --> 02:19:52,840
Cause all I really want to do is just hang out with my chat.

3354
02:19:53,100 --> 02:19:57,340
And I feel like when I do collaboration streams, I'm not focusing too much on my chat.

3355
02:19:57,600 --> 02:20:01,920
I feel like, oh, my attention is not really on my, my chat now when I collaborate.

3356
02:20:02,120 --> 02:20:05,300
And honestly, I feel so much happier just talking to my chat.

3357
02:20:05,560 --> 02:20:09,220
Than like collaborating with other streamers.

3358
02:20:09,420 --> 02:20:13,900
Um, so it's like, you guys just make my day so much.

3359
02:20:13,900 --> 02:20:16,400
And I always feel bad when I'm like, oh, I'm ignoring chat.

3360
02:20:16,540 --> 02:20:17,420
I'm ignoring chat.

3361
02:20:17,580 --> 02:20:19,280
I just want to hang out with them instead.

3362
02:20:19,660 --> 02:20:21,900
And it's just, ah, thank you guys.

3363
02:20:22,060 --> 02:20:22,660
Thank you.

3364
02:20:22,800 --> 02:20:24,280
It really does mean a lot.

3365
02:20:24,440 --> 02:20:25,280
It really does.

3366
02:20:26,320 --> 02:20:28,120
Alright, let's go to the next one.

3367
02:20:30,320 --> 02:20:32,480
Why do you stitch chat into a single mantra?

3368
02:20:32,480 --> 02:20:34,160
It's being collaborated with.

3369
02:20:38,020 --> 02:20:38,900
Hey, Doki.

3370
02:20:38,960 --> 02:20:45,840
When I first found your stream through a raid, it was when you had taken off your skin and shooting your true colors as a, as a tomato.

3371
02:20:46,080 --> 02:20:49,460
At first, I found the concept of a tomato V2 refabulous.

3372
02:20:49,520 --> 02:20:51,080
So I stayed and laughed myself for a while.

3373
02:20:51,160 --> 02:20:53,900
But I just listened to your content, humor, and most especially your laugh.

3374
02:20:54,100 --> 02:20:55,860
I decided to stay and watch.

3375
02:20:56,120 --> 02:20:58,960
Never had I ever thought about my decision as a bad one.

3376
02:20:59,060 --> 02:21:00,100
And I doubt I ever will.

3377
02:21:00,500 --> 02:21:04,180
Finding your stream was damn well one of the best things to happen to me.

3378
02:21:04,180 --> 02:21:07,540
But only a week after watching your stream, you were announcing your graduation.

3379
02:21:08,200 --> 02:21:09,820
It felt awful seeing that.

3380
02:21:09,880 --> 02:21:12,160
The new light that I just found was so fleeting.

3381
02:21:12,380 --> 02:21:13,760
I was in a pretty big rut.

3382
02:21:13,940 --> 02:21:14,840
And it felt awful.

3383
02:21:15,020 --> 02:21:16,900
I don't know if I would still be here to mourn for you.

3384
02:21:18,700 --> 02:21:21,960
But I guess I can count as a blessing that I found you at all, huh?

3385
02:21:22,260 --> 02:21:24,900
But I won't beg and plead you to stay.

3386
02:21:25,060 --> 02:21:28,480
I just want you to wish that you have the best of luck in your future endeavors.

3387
02:21:28,780 --> 02:21:30,620
And that you just remember us.

3388
02:21:30,840 --> 02:21:32,920
Of course I'll remember you guys!

3389
02:21:32,920 --> 02:21:35,860
I'll never forget the Berk noise.

3390
02:21:36,360 --> 02:21:36,860
Chat.

3391
02:21:37,480 --> 02:21:42,820
You guys, we have people hearing from all the way from 2017.

3392
02:21:43,860 --> 02:21:46,380
Like, I'll never forget any of you guys.

3393
02:21:46,500 --> 02:21:47,300
Do not worry.

3394
02:21:47,480 --> 02:21:48,480
Do not worry, guys.

3395
02:21:48,560 --> 02:21:50,360
I always recognize people from my chat.

3396
02:21:50,460 --> 02:21:52,000
Like, every single one of you.

3397
02:21:52,220 --> 02:21:57,460
And I'm so happy that I changed some of your lives for the better.

3398
02:21:57,900 --> 02:21:59,180
Like, I think like...

3399
02:22:00,880 --> 02:22:01,170
Um...

3400
02:22:01,720 --> 02:22:02,300
Hahaha.

3401
02:22:03,200 --> 02:22:07,580
Some of the streams I do, my main thing is just to make you guys laugh.

3402
02:22:07,840 --> 02:22:09,340
Because that's all I want to do.

3403
02:22:09,400 --> 02:22:10,140
Make people laugh.

3404
02:22:10,280 --> 02:22:11,540
I love making people laugh.

3405
02:22:11,820 --> 02:22:12,840
Because it's like...

3406
02:22:12,840 --> 02:22:14,480
I know what it's like to feel...

3407
02:22:14,480 --> 02:22:15,560
To feel down.

3408
02:22:15,740 --> 02:22:18,080
And I always want to make someone laugh and have fun.

3409
02:22:18,340 --> 02:22:22,020
And I'm so happy that you guys feel that.

3410
02:22:22,420 --> 02:22:25,160
Feel the effort I bring out to all of you.

3411
02:22:25,360 --> 02:22:26,800
I'm trying not to cry!

3412
02:22:26,980 --> 02:22:28,820
But I'm tearing up now!

3413
02:22:30,080 --> 02:22:31,780
I'm trying so hard!

3414
02:22:32,920 --> 02:22:33,320
Hahaha.

3415
02:22:34,340 --> 02:22:35,520
Doki, my beloved.

3416
02:22:35,700 --> 02:22:37,380
You mean so much to me.

3417
02:22:37,460 --> 02:22:41,280
And I really mean that with every fiber of my being.

3418
02:22:41,440 --> 02:22:45,320
Thank you for letting me be a part of your community.

3419
02:22:45,420 --> 02:22:46,760
And inspiring me artistically.

3420
02:22:46,840 --> 02:22:49,180
And making me laugh when I wasn't having the best day.

3421
02:22:49,540 --> 02:22:51,380
It means so much to me.

3422
02:22:51,460 --> 02:22:54,480
And I will treasure every moment I've had in your streams.

3423
02:22:54,760 --> 02:22:57,020
Thank you and good luck with your future.

3424
02:22:57,240 --> 02:22:58,380
Felicity Machika.

3425
02:22:59,040 --> 02:22:59,560
Machika!

3426
02:22:59,740 --> 02:23:01,720
Thank you for that message.

3427
02:23:02,920 --> 02:23:04,120
Thank you so much.

3428
02:23:04,200 --> 02:23:08,400
I'm so happy that you enjoyed your time with the community.

3429
02:23:08,900 --> 02:23:10,560
I'm so happy a lot of you.

3430
02:23:10,620 --> 02:23:13,020
I'm really happy with the community I built.

3431
02:23:13,200 --> 02:23:14,880
I really am.

3432
02:23:15,100 --> 02:23:17,100
All the dumb stuff I came up with.

3433
02:23:17,180 --> 02:23:17,820
The Bark Knights.

3434
02:23:18,180 --> 02:23:19,380
The Tomato Squad.

3435
02:23:19,780 --> 02:23:20,960
All the Doki Squad.

3436
02:23:21,540 --> 02:23:24,300
It was just like on the fly things.

3437
02:23:24,500 --> 02:23:26,860
And then we kept these jokes up for so long.

3438
02:23:27,220 --> 02:23:31,520
For these names for ourselves.

3439
02:23:31,700 --> 02:23:32,900
And these jokes for ourselves.

3440
02:23:32,900 --> 02:23:34,420
This inner circle.

3441
02:23:35,240 --> 02:23:38,020
This inner community thing we had together.

3442
02:23:38,280 --> 02:23:38,940
Our claps.

3443
02:23:39,260 --> 02:23:42,260
Our little dumb brain cells gimmicks.

3444
02:23:44,120 --> 02:23:46,900
I'm so happy that the Doki Squad.

3445
02:23:47,340 --> 02:23:49,020
Anything for the Doki Squad.

3446
02:23:50,800 --> 02:23:55,120
I'm just so happy that we kept those.

3447
02:23:55,220 --> 02:23:57,000
Many of these jokes were like years.

3448
02:23:57,120 --> 02:23:59,020
Something that we came up with for years.

3449
02:23:59,260 --> 02:24:00,500
And something that was on the fly.

3450
02:24:01,360 --> 02:24:02,460
Thank you everyone.

3451
02:24:02,460 --> 02:24:04,740
It really does mean so much.

3452
02:24:04,820 --> 02:24:06,700
We were able to keep this community.

3453
02:24:07,500 --> 02:24:08,760
Through so long.

3454
02:24:11,140 --> 02:24:13,040
And please hydrate right after graduating.

3455
02:24:14,420 --> 02:24:15,380
How about that?

3456
02:24:19,580 --> 02:24:20,180
Good.

3457
02:24:20,320 --> 02:24:20,880
Good idea.

3458
02:24:22,500 --> 02:24:24,020
A little intermission there.

3459
02:24:26,120 --> 02:24:28,240
I'm not educated for math and reading.

3460
02:24:28,380 --> 02:24:28,780
Fuck reading.

3461
02:24:29,160 --> 02:24:29,980
I'm not reading.

3462
02:24:30,580 --> 02:24:31,560
Someone else is.

3463
02:24:33,140 --> 02:24:33,800
Wait.

3464
02:24:33,900 --> 02:24:34,220
Guys.

3465
02:24:34,440 --> 02:24:35,960
I just learned how to read.

3466
02:24:36,580 --> 02:24:39,660
I learned how to read for this particular stream.

3467
02:24:43,260 --> 02:24:44,360
It's a miracle!

3468
02:24:45,210 --> 02:24:46,400
I learned how to read guys.

3469
02:24:47,250 --> 02:24:51,520
My character arc has finally been complete, everyone.

3470
02:24:52,080 --> 02:24:55,440
We have finally completed our character arc.

3471
02:24:55,760 --> 02:24:57,400
I learned how to read.

3472
02:25:00,660 --> 02:25:01,300
Finally!

3473
02:25:01,460 --> 02:25:02,700
I can re-chat!

3474
02:25:05,880 --> 02:25:07,960
I was learning to read.

3475
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:11,080
What did she forget after?

3476
02:25:12,160 --> 02:25:13,440
She did it!

3477
02:25:13,480 --> 02:25:14,080
I did it!

3478
02:25:14,220 --> 02:25:14,860
I did it!

3479
02:25:18,200 --> 02:25:21,360
The Bee Movie taught me my ABCs.

3480
02:25:21,360 --> 02:25:22,660
We're all cousins now.

3481
02:25:25,300 --> 02:25:29,120
I really hope you have a happy and healthy life moving forward.

3482
02:25:29,280 --> 02:25:31,980
And doing what you do will never forget you.

3483
02:25:32,020 --> 02:25:33,480
I'll never forget you guys too.

3484
02:25:33,580 --> 02:25:34,220
Do not worry.

3485
02:25:34,520 --> 02:25:35,840
I'll never forget you guys.

3486
02:25:36,180 --> 02:25:37,760
You grow up so fast!

3487
02:25:38,100 --> 02:25:40,220
You finally passed first grade!

3488
02:25:45,980 --> 02:25:50,920
Hey Doki, even though I didn't know you long, I really enjoyed your streams the past month.

3489
02:25:51,080 --> 02:25:52,640
You're really such a welcoming and kind person.

3490
02:25:52,660 --> 02:25:54,580
You have so much energy in your stream, no matter the situation.

3491
02:25:54,880 --> 02:25:58,780
I love your laugh, it's seriously contagious too.

3492
02:25:58,980 --> 02:26:00,580
Oh yeah, and your thieving skills?

3493
02:26:00,760 --> 02:26:01,620
Second to none.

3494
02:26:01,840 --> 02:26:03,560
Yep, where are their points now?

3495
02:26:03,780 --> 02:26:04,260
Gone.

3496
02:26:07,400 --> 02:26:08,720
A beautiful heist.

3497
02:26:09,020 --> 02:26:12,120
I appreciate for not only...

3498
02:26:12,660 --> 02:26:14,480
I appreciate for...

3499
02:26:14,480 --> 02:26:17,520
Clearly my reading skills have not been that great.

3500
02:26:18,400 --> 02:26:20,300
I already lost track of where I was.

3501
02:26:20,560 --> 02:26:26,180
I appreciate for not only what you do, I appreciate for the impact you have brought to the community, but the impact you've left on all of us.

3502
02:26:26,340 --> 02:26:30,860
I want to work harder and bring the kind positivity you brought to not...

3503
02:26:32,020 --> 02:26:33,420
to... not to us?

3504
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:35,660
To... to... to...

3505
02:26:35,660 --> 02:26:37,620
Oh, brought on to us!

3506
02:26:37,740 --> 02:26:38,180
I was like...

3507
02:26:40,080 --> 02:26:41,200
Brought on to us.

3508
02:26:42,120 --> 02:26:46,920
Big or small, best of luck in your future plans and stay on the run you sneaky thief.

3509
02:26:47,260 --> 02:26:49,200
Thank you from a forever Park Night.

3510
02:26:49,460 --> 02:26:49,900
AHHHHH!

3511
02:26:49,900 --> 02:26:51,160
I'm sorry for...

3512
02:26:51,160 --> 02:26:52,700
For like loosing...

3513
02:26:52,700 --> 02:26:54,820
Slowly loosing my reading skills there.

3514
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:55,880
Miss Angel.

3515
02:26:56,240 --> 02:27:01,340
My reading skills...

3516
02:27:01,760 --> 02:27:03,520
Slowly deteriorated there.

3517
02:27:04,620 --> 02:27:05,700
I was like...

3518
02:27:05,700 --> 02:27:06,840
I was like...

3519
02:27:06,840 --> 02:27:07,080
Where...

3520
02:27:07,080 --> 02:27:08,140
Where did it go?

3521
02:27:11,720 --> 02:27:12,960
Thank you.

3522
02:27:14,700 --> 02:27:15,680
Thank you everyone.

3523
02:27:15,980 --> 02:27:16,700
Thank you...

3524
02:27:16,700 --> 02:27:17,440
Thank you...

3525
02:27:17,440 --> 02:27:19,020
That was my message.

3526
02:27:19,020 --> 02:27:19,920
Thank you for being so...

3527
02:27:19,920 --> 02:27:21,820
Thank you Jay for this message.

3528
02:27:22,320 --> 02:27:23,340
Thank you again.

3529
02:27:24,400 --> 02:27:26,000
It really means a lot guys.

3530
02:27:26,140 --> 02:27:27,300
They are all your messages.

3531
02:27:27,900 --> 02:27:29,360
So I didn't want to...

3532
02:27:29,360 --> 02:27:30,120
Press on you.

3533
02:27:31,800 --> 02:27:36,580
It really means a lot that you guys take your time out to write a personal message to me.

3534
02:27:36,620 --> 02:27:37,380
It really does.

3535
02:27:37,660 --> 02:27:38,420
Thank you everyone.

3536
02:27:38,760 --> 02:27:40,240
We have been following you for a little while.

3537
02:27:40,280 --> 02:27:41,980
But I'm so glad I caught a few of your streams.

3538
02:27:42,100 --> 02:27:43,740
Can't help but smile and laugh every time.

3539
02:27:43,860 --> 02:27:44,860
Thank you.

3540
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:46,020
That was my goal.

3541
02:27:46,320 --> 02:27:47,180
I honestly...

3542
02:27:47,180 --> 02:27:49,820
Every time I started my stream, my goal was just to make you guys laugh.

3543
02:27:50,120 --> 02:27:50,560
That's all.

3544
02:27:50,720 --> 02:27:51,500
And then I realized...

3545
02:27:52,440 --> 02:27:52,820
Man...

3546
02:27:53,340 --> 02:27:54,640
And then I realized...

3547
02:27:55,100 --> 02:27:56,400
I'm starting to get angry.

3548
02:27:56,840 --> 02:27:57,760
Because of Apex.

3549
02:27:58,980 --> 02:27:59,660
I was like...

3550
02:27:59,660 --> 02:28:00,800
Guys, we're gonna have to stop.

3551
02:28:00,920 --> 02:28:02,500
Because all I want to do is make you guys laugh.

3552
02:28:02,540 --> 02:28:03,330
I don't want to be angry.

3553
02:28:04,100 --> 02:28:06,060
I want to be happy and funny.

3554
02:28:06,900 --> 02:28:07,860
Because I'm funny.

3555
02:28:10,260 --> 02:28:13,320
And if I'm not funny, I make you guys laugh.

3556
02:28:13,400 --> 02:28:14,940
Because my laugh forces you to.

3557
02:28:15,280 --> 02:28:16,960
I can make dumb jokes funny.

3558
02:28:16,960 --> 02:28:17,980
If I laugh.

3559
02:28:21,380 --> 02:28:23,480
Truly an amazing power...

3560
02:28:23,480 --> 02:28:24,960
Truly amazing...

3561
02:28:25,680 --> 02:28:26,640
Truly amazing...

3562
02:28:26,640 --> 02:28:28,720
I'm in the tier 1...

3563
02:28:28,720 --> 02:28:29,040
I'm in the tier 1...

3564
02:28:29,040 --> 02:28:29,400
Brawly!

3565
02:28:29,560 --> 02:28:32,000
Thank you for the sub at tier 1!

3566
02:28:32,280 --> 02:28:33,400
Thank you, thank you!

3567
02:28:33,820 --> 02:28:36,560
Can we get some Bark Knights for real quick?

3568
02:28:36,940 --> 02:28:40,760
For Brawly, for the tier 1 at 1 month.

3569
02:28:40,900 --> 02:28:42,020
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

3570
02:28:42,160 --> 02:28:43,760
I really do appreciate it, guys.

3571
02:28:43,920 --> 02:28:44,920
Thank you so much.

3572
02:28:45,080 --> 02:28:46,680
Can we get some Bark Knights real quick?

3573
02:28:46,680 --> 02:28:49,180
Thank you!

3574
02:29:25,160 --> 02:29:27,960
Thank you!

3575
02:29:48,220 --> 02:29:51,060
How is everyone gonna know that you are the pony?

3576
02:29:51,220 --> 02:29:53,840
That you should know if you don't stream anymore?

3577
02:29:54,560 --> 02:30:01,860
I swear, even after you go, if you don't listen to the daily song every day, then you have failed me.

3578
02:30:02,880 --> 02:30:05,380
That is my dying wish to you all.

3579
02:30:07,740 --> 02:30:10,600
You guys better be listening to that song every day.

3580
02:30:12,460 --> 02:30:13,660
Or I will know.

3581
02:30:13,780 --> 02:30:14,740
I'll find out.

3582
02:30:14,880 --> 02:30:16,060
I'll find out.

3583
02:30:16,680 --> 02:30:18,760
And I'll take your Bark Knight badge away.

3584
02:30:24,500 --> 02:30:26,920
You see me and I'm so humble.

3585
02:30:33,300 --> 02:30:38,240
While we didn't know each other for so long, I enjoyed spending my time watching your streams and hanging out in Overwatch.

3586
02:30:38,540 --> 02:30:41,520
I will always be proud to be a Bark Knight.

3587
02:30:41,740 --> 02:30:44,240
Oh, thank you Steve.

3588
02:30:45,120 --> 02:30:46,020
Thank you.

3589
02:30:46,680 --> 02:30:48,360
I really do appreciate it.

3590
02:30:48,420 --> 02:30:49,300
Thank you guys.

3591
02:30:54,220 --> 02:30:55,060
No, no, no.

3592
02:30:55,100 --> 02:30:55,680
I'm not dying.

3593
02:30:55,880 --> 02:30:57,500
I never die, guys!

3594
02:30:58,660 --> 02:30:59,900
That was just a lie.

3595
02:31:02,280 --> 02:31:03,520
Because I'm a thief.

3596
02:31:11,470 --> 02:31:12,290
But it's okay.

3597
02:31:12,350 --> 02:31:13,910
I'll tell you when I'm lying, okay?

3598
02:31:14,650 --> 02:31:16,590
But that way, I'm not dying.

3599
02:31:21,050 --> 02:31:21,490
I'm not lying.

3600
02:31:21,490 --> 02:31:23,110
People lying shake my head.

3601
02:31:25,210 --> 02:31:25,650
Alright.

3602
02:31:26,670 --> 02:31:27,530
Okay, Jake.

3603
02:31:27,850 --> 02:31:29,270
Thank you for hanging out with us.

3604
02:31:29,290 --> 02:31:30,450
I really appreciate it, Jake.

3605
02:31:30,490 --> 02:31:32,170
I hope you have a good night's rest.

3606
02:31:33,710 --> 02:31:35,210
Whatever you're doing the rest of the day.

3607
02:31:35,250 --> 02:31:35,770
Have a good day.

3608
02:31:35,930 --> 02:31:37,070
Thank you for coming by.

3609
02:31:38,250 --> 02:31:38,770
Thank you.

3610
02:31:38,810 --> 02:31:39,070
Thank you.

3611
02:31:40,230 --> 02:31:41,770
Alright, what's the next one?

3612
02:31:42,170 --> 02:31:45,930
I know I've only been here for a few months.

3613
02:31:45,930 --> 02:32:12,470
We will never have October month!

3614
02:32:12,470 --> 02:32:15,230
We will never have spooky month again!

3615
02:32:21,090 --> 02:32:26,730
I was like, I will never have to play spooky games again.

3616
02:32:27,070 --> 02:32:28,710
No more spooky mansion.

3617
02:32:31,750 --> 02:32:33,290
Portal wasn't a horror game.

3618
02:32:33,410 --> 02:32:37,770
More so of like, I just devolved into a caveman at the end.

3619
02:32:38,210 --> 02:32:41,970
All I could do was just up, down, and up.

3620
02:32:43,970 --> 02:32:46,550
Up, down, where do I go?

3621
02:32:49,570 --> 02:32:52,570
Mike, thank you so much for the raid!

3622
02:32:53,350 --> 02:32:54,250
Thank you!

3623
02:32:54,390 --> 02:32:57,710
I hope you had a great stream playing Resident Evil Village.

3624
02:32:57,730 --> 02:33:01,030
Holy shit, you played it... what difficulty did you play?

3625
02:33:01,130 --> 02:33:04,130
I heard the difficulty in the... what was it?

3626
02:33:04,190 --> 02:33:05,650
The village difficulty or whatever?

3627
02:33:06,030 --> 02:33:11,090
I heard that one was really really hard and people just rage quit at the Lady D part.

3628
02:33:11,090 --> 02:33:13,790
When she's like... when... that part.

3629
02:33:14,010 --> 02:33:17,350
I don't want to spoil, but a lot of people rage quit at the Lady D part.

3630
02:33:20,770 --> 02:33:22,350
For the hardest difficulty.

3631
02:33:23,890 --> 02:33:27,430
I saw one guy when he was at a boss fight for Lady D.

3632
02:33:27,530 --> 02:33:32,490
He spent like 6 hours on the boss fight and then he gave up and went to medium mode.

3633
02:33:32,930 --> 02:33:39,350
And he gave... and for like 6 plus hours he gave up and then like swapped to medium.

3634
02:33:39,350 --> 02:33:43,870
He replayed the game all the way... he restarted the entire game.

3635
02:33:44,310 --> 02:33:45,770
Because he was like, why not?

3636
02:33:47,310 --> 02:33:49,010
How do you play Big Bang Mario?

3637
02:33:49,110 --> 02:33:51,910
I think we all know how we all feel about Miss Lady D.

3638
02:33:52,630 --> 02:33:58,990
Okay, Mrs. Donkey, you have so many of my tends to call the channels I follow to a manageable size.

3639
02:33:59,290 --> 02:34:02,670
You are so right because of how happy you always seem to be.

3640
02:34:02,670 --> 02:34:03,150
Ohhhhh.

3641
02:34:04,830 --> 02:34:07,230
Oh, that's really sweet, Paul.

3642
02:34:07,530 --> 02:34:08,910
That really is sweet.

3643
02:34:09,570 --> 02:34:10,130
Alright.

3644
02:34:11,750 --> 02:34:13,110
So, I'll be like...

3645
02:34:13,110 --> 02:34:17,190
Thank you, Amy, for the great times, memories, and streams.

3646
02:34:17,690 --> 02:34:21,230
Your laughs are amazing and always lift my spirits.

3647
02:34:21,530 --> 02:34:25,010
You've built an amazing community and I'm glad to have been part of it.

3648
02:34:25,150 --> 02:34:27,250
I wish you luck in your future endeavors.

3649
02:34:27,570 --> 02:34:31,210
Though this isn't a goodbye, I hope to see you around every so often.

3650
02:34:31,310 --> 02:34:32,230
Bright nights forever.

3651
02:34:32,870 --> 02:34:34,090
Bright nights forever!

3652
02:34:35,310 --> 02:34:36,810
Bright nights forever, guys.

3653
02:34:37,090 --> 02:34:39,270
I hope you always remember the bright nights, everyone.

3654
02:34:39,410 --> 02:34:43,870
Even in 50 years, you will be like, wow, that's part of a cult called the bright nights.

3655
02:34:45,430 --> 02:34:47,490
You're like, was I in a cult?

3656
02:34:56,010 --> 02:34:58,670
I hope you... the cult of cousins.

3657
02:35:01,590 --> 02:35:02,610
Bright nights forever!

3658
02:35:04,530 --> 02:35:08,510
I hope you'll always remember the bright nights, even in like 50 years or so.

3659
02:35:10,090 --> 02:35:12,110
April, I've been with you since the old day.

3660
02:35:12,210 --> 02:35:16,210
I don't think this thing is that long, but I know it's long enough to know you mean a lot to me.

3661
02:35:16,310 --> 02:35:17,690
I'll miss you and your content.

3662
02:35:17,830 --> 02:35:18,750
Thank you for everything.

3663
02:35:19,190 --> 02:35:21,810
I won't forget a single moment.

3664
02:35:22,170 --> 02:35:23,330
Oh, I'm back.

3665
02:35:23,510 --> 02:35:28,190
Yes, I have a lot of you guys that have been with me since my Overwatch days.

3666
02:35:28,190 --> 02:35:30,370
Since 2017, isn't that crazy?

3667
02:35:30,950 --> 02:35:36,430
And it's like... it's just crazy for me to think that you guys put up with me for so long.

3668
02:35:36,630 --> 02:35:40,690
For the many hiatuses I've done for all of you too.

3669
02:35:41,050 --> 02:35:43,990
Like, I would be like... I wouldn't even let you guys know.

3670
02:35:44,050 --> 02:35:46,450
I just disappear for months and be like, hey guys.

3671
02:35:46,750 --> 02:35:48,470
And then I'll be like, welcome back now.

3672
02:35:50,270 --> 02:35:53,370
But this is the final... the final goodbye.

3673
02:35:53,630 --> 02:35:55,210
This will be the final goodbye.

3674
02:35:55,650 --> 02:35:57,350
So, this is not a hiatus.

3675
02:35:57,350 --> 02:35:59,090
I just need to reiterate that this is...

3676
02:35:59,090 --> 02:36:01,550
I know I've done a lot of hiatuses in my time.

3677
02:36:01,710 --> 02:36:06,810
But this is not... I have to... I really have to reiterate that this is not a hiatus.

3678
02:36:07,010 --> 02:36:12,870
So that's why I'm like... really surprised that so many of you stayed with me for... for so long.

3679
02:36:13,150 --> 02:36:15,790
Even with all the shit I did, I pulled on you guys.

3680
02:36:15,870 --> 02:36:17,950
Even with all this shit I pulled on you guys.

3681
02:36:17,990 --> 02:36:19,810
I don't even warn anyone.

3682
02:36:19,950 --> 02:36:20,730
I'm just like... I'm gone.

3683
02:36:21,150 --> 02:36:22,330
I'm just like... sorry.

3684
02:36:22,670 --> 02:36:25,070
I'm missing for 4 months.

3685
02:36:25,190 --> 02:36:25,650
I'm sorry.

3686
02:36:30,780 --> 02:36:32,600
I know I've only been here for a couple days.

3687
02:36:32,640 --> 02:36:34,360
But thank you for making me laugh so hard.

3688
02:36:34,460 --> 02:36:35,340
Your laughs are so contagious.

3689
02:36:35,520 --> 02:36:36,420
And I love it when you say...

3690
02:36:36,420 --> 02:36:37,140
It is.

3691
02:36:37,320 --> 02:36:38,900
I wish I'd discovered you sooner.

3692
02:36:38,940 --> 02:36:40,680
And I wish you all... Thank you, Sarah.

3693
02:36:41,520 --> 02:36:42,280
Thank you.

3694
02:36:42,300 --> 02:36:44,080
That... that really does mean a lot.

3695
02:36:44,280 --> 02:36:45,560
Dear Shun'o, here son.

3696
02:36:45,740 --> 02:36:47,240
This is my old body pillow.

3697
02:36:47,560 --> 02:36:50,040
It will laugh at you if you need it.

3698
02:36:50,460 --> 02:36:53,940
Hug... hug this anime girl when you're sad, boy.

3699
02:36:54,820 --> 02:36:55,220
Hahahaha.

3700
02:36:55,220 --> 02:36:55,640
Hahahaha.

3701
02:36:59,280 --> 02:37:00,600
Boy, are you sad?

3702
02:37:00,960 --> 02:37:02,060
Hug the pillow.

3703
02:37:02,540 --> 02:37:02,880
Hahahaha.

3704
02:37:03,160 --> 02:37:04,740
And you go up to the little boy.

3705
02:37:04,940 --> 02:37:06,000
Bar nights forever.

3706
02:37:06,620 --> 02:37:07,020
Hahahaha.

3707
02:37:15,580 --> 02:37:16,540
Alright, let's...

3708
02:37:17,480 --> 02:37:18,340
Bop bop bop.

3709
02:37:19,840 --> 02:37:21,120
Unfortunately, we're cousins.

3710
02:37:21,520 --> 02:37:22,540
Oh my god.

3711
02:37:22,720 --> 02:37:23,460
See me?

3712
02:37:25,260 --> 02:37:28,200
Unfortunately, I discovered your channel on the day you announced your graduation.

3713
02:37:28,860 --> 02:37:31,540
And during the last month, I wasn't able to join you because of college.

3714
02:37:31,680 --> 02:37:33,340
I would be tired and fall asleep.

3715
02:37:33,520 --> 02:37:35,700
But I've been able to watch some videos and it's been fun.

3716
02:37:35,960 --> 02:37:41,900
I just want to wish you good luck with the future and thank you for brightening up my day.

3717
02:37:42,600 --> 02:37:45,280
Aww, thank you whoever sent that message.

3718
02:37:45,580 --> 02:37:46,320
Thank you guys.

3719
02:37:46,720 --> 02:37:47,480
I just...

3720
02:37:47,480 --> 02:37:48,860
Thank you everyone.

3721
02:37:49,620 --> 02:37:50,160
Hahahaha.

3722
02:37:51,260 --> 02:37:53,300
It really does mean a lot.

3723
02:37:53,520 --> 02:38:01,660
Like, I'm just happy that even for some people, for those who are like the short times you guys watch me, that I still left an impression on all of you.

3724
02:38:02,180 --> 02:38:04,220
And that really does mean a lot.

3725
02:38:04,280 --> 02:38:04,940
It really does.

3726
02:38:05,340 --> 02:38:09,680
I'm gonna hide my doki-mokura and play streams and laugh from inside it.

3727
02:38:09,960 --> 02:38:10,160
Hahaha.

3728
02:38:12,700 --> 02:38:15,860
Man, I remember finding out like one of you and playing that perspective and just laughing about it.

3729
02:38:15,900 --> 02:38:17,940
It's sad to see you go, but it was fun while it lasted.

3730
02:38:18,080 --> 02:38:18,860
Oh my god.

3731
02:38:19,140 --> 02:38:19,940
What was it?

3732
02:38:20,060 --> 02:38:21,040
What was that game?

3733
02:38:21,240 --> 02:38:24,640
The game... the one that... where I broke the game?

3734
02:38:25,700 --> 02:38:26,980
And... and I...

3735
02:38:26,980 --> 02:38:28,760
What was that perspective game again?

3736
02:38:28,780 --> 02:38:29,440
I already forgot.

3737
02:38:29,880 --> 02:38:31,280
But... and then I ended up...

3738
02:38:31,280 --> 02:38:35,800
Apparently there was a... I ended up like brute forcing my way to solving the apple game.

3739
02:38:36,580 --> 02:38:37,140
Superliminal.

3740
02:38:37,160 --> 02:38:37,940
Yes, super...

3741
02:38:37,940 --> 02:38:40,040
Yeah, I forget every game I touch.

3742
02:38:40,380 --> 02:38:43,060
And then... and then you guys remember that apple part?

3743
02:38:43,160 --> 02:38:46,440
So you know, I remember how you like solve the apple part.

3744
02:38:46,600 --> 02:38:51,540
So apparently the way I solved it was not a very conventional way of solving it.

3745
02:38:51,740 --> 02:38:53,040
The tiny apple.

3746
02:38:53,280 --> 02:38:56,140
I was not supposed to solve it like that.

3747
02:38:56,740 --> 02:38:57,300
Hahahaha.

3748
02:38:59,680 --> 02:39:04,640
For some reason, the tiny apple just... I just made so many apples.

3749
02:39:05,060 --> 02:39:09,920
That one tiny apple managed to drift towards me.

3750
02:39:10,280 --> 02:39:13,040
And... and then I just slowly made more.

3751
02:39:13,340 --> 02:39:13,980
Hahahaha.

3752
02:39:14,900 --> 02:39:17,860
It was so tiny, but I did it.

3753
02:39:18,160 --> 02:39:18,800
Hahahaha.

3754
02:39:20,200 --> 02:39:22,060
Every puzzle I did...

3755
02:39:22,060 --> 02:39:23,760
For tiny apple...

3756
02:39:23,760 --> 02:39:27,280
Every puzzle I did in Superliminal was not a very conventional way of solving it.

3757
02:39:27,280 --> 02:39:30,180
I broke that game so many times.

3758
02:39:30,300 --> 02:39:32,980
Because I can... I broke it so many times.

3759
02:39:33,600 --> 02:39:34,120
Gumi!

3760
02:39:34,980 --> 02:39:37,320
Thank you for the raid, Gumi!

3761
02:39:38,640 --> 02:39:39,620
Thank you!

3762
02:39:39,880 --> 02:39:41,580
I hope you had a great stream.

3763
02:39:41,600 --> 02:39:44,200
I saw you were playing Pokemon Snap earlier, Gumi.

3764
02:39:45,460 --> 02:39:46,600
How was it?

3765
02:39:46,880 --> 02:39:49,300
But thank you again for the raid, guys.

3766
02:39:49,420 --> 02:39:50,480
Thank you again.

3767
02:39:50,800 --> 02:39:51,820
Thank you, Gumi.

3768
02:39:52,080 --> 02:39:53,380
I hope you had a great stream.

3769
02:39:54,760 --> 02:39:56,660
I'm just reading our Marshmallow stuff.

3770
02:39:56,720 --> 02:39:57,260
I don't... I don't...

3771
02:39:57,280 --> 02:39:59,600
Final... Final messages...

3772
02:39:59,600 --> 02:40:01,280
Oh, good luck in your Subathon!

3773
02:40:01,680 --> 02:40:02,940
Tomorrow, Gumi.

3774
02:40:03,200 --> 02:40:04,100
Good luck!

3775
02:40:04,780 --> 02:40:05,900
Oh, we have a great Sub...

3776
02:40:05,900 --> 02:40:09,640
I heard like a maximum extension is like 72 hours or something.

3777
02:40:10,100 --> 02:40:10,520
Like...

3778
02:40:10,520 --> 02:40:10,680
Hahaha.

3779
02:40:11,420 --> 02:40:12,440
Gumi, are you gonna...

3780
02:40:12,440 --> 02:40:13,240
Are you gonna sleep?

3781
02:40:13,520 --> 02:40:13,860
Like...

3782
02:40:13,860 --> 02:40:14,800
Are you gonna sleep?

3783
02:40:15,280 --> 02:40:15,840
Hahaha.

3784
02:40:17,040 --> 02:40:18,720
Are you gonna do a sleep stream, Gumi?

3785
02:40:19,340 --> 02:40:19,900
Hahaha.

3786
02:40:20,880 --> 02:40:21,840
Thank you.

3787
02:40:23,460 --> 02:40:24,720
Thank you, thank you.

3788
02:40:25,860 --> 02:40:26,420
Alright.

3789
02:40:27,500 --> 02:40:27,980
So...

3790
02:40:27,980 --> 02:40:28,700
Hey, Berg.

3791
02:40:28,760 --> 02:40:32,800
Just last minute message to say thanks for all the laughs.

3792
02:40:32,880 --> 02:40:37,500
At first, I found you on Twitter and just followed for art.

3793
02:40:37,620 --> 02:40:47,180
But I got curious one time when I saw you streamed and were playing Apex and honestly just kinda was in awe watching you play so different from what I've done myself.

3794
02:40:47,780 --> 02:40:51,060
You inspired me to try more and I actually felt like I improved a lot.

3795
02:40:51,260 --> 02:40:55,340
From there, I just showed up because I was up way too late way too often.

3796
02:40:55,340 --> 02:40:59,160
And it was always a blast to be around and hear that laugh.

3797
02:40:59,440 --> 02:41:05,380
I know I stole my sword with the points but I honestly glad I got to help out even if it wasn't that much.

3798
02:41:05,700 --> 02:41:06,360
You helped...

3799
02:41:06,360 --> 02:41:06,560
I...

3800
02:41:06,560 --> 02:41:07,100
Is this Azer?

3801
02:41:07,340 --> 02:41:08,200
This has to be Azer.

3802
02:41:09,380 --> 02:41:11,900
You're the only one that stole the mod sword.

3803
02:41:12,460 --> 02:41:12,820
Hahaha.

3804
02:41:16,600 --> 02:41:21,040
Azer, I know this is you because you're the only one that stole the sword out of all of us.

3805
02:41:21,380 --> 02:41:21,820
Hahaha.

3806
02:41:23,140 --> 02:41:25,060
But Azer, you helped out a lot.

3807
02:41:25,140 --> 02:41:25,320
I love you.

3808
02:41:25,320 --> 02:41:28,000
You helped out especially the Minecraft server.

3809
02:41:28,020 --> 02:41:30,840
You helped out so much in Minecraft as well.

3810
02:41:30,980 --> 02:41:35,600
We all stole the sword at one point but it was mods stealing swords from each other.

3811
02:41:36,080 --> 02:41:36,280
Hahaha.

3812
02:41:38,960 --> 02:41:41,980
I'm gonna miss hanging out with you and the rest of the...

3813
02:41:42,580 --> 02:41:48,460
The rest of the Bark Knights but I'm sure you're gonna keep doing amazing with what comes next.

3814
02:41:48,640 --> 02:41:52,540
And it was really awesome seeing how much effort and thought you kept putting into stream.

3815
02:41:52,680 --> 02:41:54,900
I think my favorite will always be seeing each year...

3816
02:41:54,900 --> 02:41:55,300
Each year.

3817
02:41:55,300 --> 02:41:56,600
I'm gonna cheer up simply by going live.

3818
02:41:56,720 --> 02:41:58,800
Well it's great to know we could help you out Blanky.

3819
02:41:58,880 --> 02:41:59,860
I gotta see you around.

3820
02:42:00,100 --> 02:42:01,620
I'm dying for my sword.

3821
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:02,320
Hahaha.

3822
02:42:04,740 --> 02:42:08,020
Whenever she'll smile I get a brain...

3823
02:42:08,020 --> 02:42:08,540
Hahaha.

3824
02:42:10,760 --> 02:42:12,080
But you guys do not know.

3825
02:42:12,780 --> 02:42:13,220
Um.

3826
02:42:13,700 --> 02:42:18,620
We had a point where I had a thing where people could steal mod from each other.

3827
02:42:18,920 --> 02:42:22,060
So like people who are not mods can steal swords from the mods.

3828
02:42:22,220 --> 02:42:23,440
And I thought it was like a fun thing.

3829
02:42:23,640 --> 02:42:25,280
But I realized I was like...

3830
02:42:25,300 --> 02:42:26,920
Okay this is gonna get really bad.

3831
02:42:27,060 --> 02:42:29,060
Cause what if like we had this secret lurker.

3832
02:42:29,180 --> 02:42:30,640
Like a secret lurker that was like...

3833
02:42:30,640 --> 02:42:31,220
Ha ha ha.

3834
02:42:31,560 --> 02:42:34,180
I'm gonna lurk in this channel just to steal mine.

3835
02:42:34,620 --> 02:42:36,000
And then he bans everyone.

3836
02:42:36,700 --> 02:42:37,080
Hahaha.

3837
02:42:37,780 --> 02:42:40,620
So I was like maybe this isn't a good idea.

3838
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:41,320
Hahaha.

3839
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:44,300
So I had to get rid of that later.

3840
02:42:44,560 --> 02:42:45,480
I had to...

3841
02:42:45,480 --> 02:42:46,240
I was like you know what?

3842
02:42:46,320 --> 02:42:48,800
I realized there was a...

3843
02:42:48,800 --> 02:42:54,080
There might be a secret lurker there that wanted to save all the points just to ban everyone.

3844
02:42:54,080 --> 02:42:54,680
Hahaha.

3845
02:42:56,380 --> 02:42:56,940
Refresh them.

3846
02:42:56,960 --> 02:42:57,300
I'll...

3847
02:42:57,300 --> 02:42:58,620
Don't worry I'll refresh it guys.

3848
02:42:58,820 --> 02:43:00,120
I'll refresh it when we get to the bottom.

3849
02:43:00,760 --> 02:43:01,200
Hahaha.

3850
02:43:03,020 --> 02:43:04,240
How do you even do that?

3851
02:43:04,300 --> 02:43:06,000
It's just like they just redeem the points.

3852
02:43:06,240 --> 02:43:06,600
Um.

3853
02:43:07,400 --> 02:43:08,520
And they just slowly...

3854
02:43:08,520 --> 02:43:10,480
They just slowly just ban everyone in chat.

3855
02:43:11,100 --> 02:43:11,540
Hahaha.

3856
02:43:12,760 --> 02:43:14,980
Now he's upgrading his heist of them all.

3857
02:43:15,240 --> 02:43:17,880
I gave up my sword for Alex to feel strong man.

3858
02:43:18,420 --> 02:43:18,860
Hahaha.

3859
02:43:20,360 --> 02:43:20,800
Hahaha.

3860
02:43:21,340 --> 02:43:21,780
Hahaha.

3861
02:43:21,780 --> 02:43:22,220
Hahaha.

3862
02:43:23,100 --> 02:43:23,540
Hahaha.

3863
02:43:23,540 --> 02:43:23,580
Hahaha.

3864
02:43:23,580 --> 02:43:23,600
Hahaha.

3865
02:43:23,600 --> 02:43:23,620
Hahaha.

3866
02:43:23,620 --> 02:43:25,160
Alright let's see.

3867
02:43:25,380 --> 02:43:26,820
Congrats on your graduation.

3868
02:43:27,280 --> 02:43:30,220
It's been wonderful to see your streams and hang out at the movie nights.

3869
02:43:30,440 --> 02:43:36,140
We'll surely miss you and your infectious laugh and continue to wish the best of you.

3870
02:43:36,200 --> 02:43:39,840
Don't be shy to still chat with us and we're all still here for you Doki.

3871
02:43:39,920 --> 02:43:41,640
Congrats again and take care.

3872
02:43:41,920 --> 02:43:43,720
Thief of the Bark Knight's heart.

3873
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:45,260
Thank you dragon.

3874
02:43:45,860 --> 02:43:46,760
Thank you.

3875
02:43:47,200 --> 02:43:50,520
Ah guys I really do miss all of you.

3876
02:43:50,600 --> 02:43:51,700
Thank you everyone.

3877
02:43:52,380 --> 02:43:52,900
Hahaha.

3878
02:43:53,080 --> 02:43:53,600
I'm so happy.

3879
02:43:55,060 --> 02:43:56,720
It really does mean a lot.

3880
02:43:56,840 --> 02:44:00,860
It really does mean a lot that you guys are taking your time to write me these messages guys.

3881
02:44:01,200 --> 02:44:02,140
It really does.

3882
02:44:02,400 --> 02:44:05,580
Cause it takes me like 3 plus days to reply to anyone.

3883
02:44:06,540 --> 02:44:07,020
Hahaha.

3884
02:44:08,940 --> 02:44:10,280
It takes me that much.

3885
02:44:11,140 --> 02:44:12,220
You don't understand.

3886
02:44:12,620 --> 02:44:13,500
It drains my energy.

3887
02:44:13,580 --> 02:44:18,340
Typing a message to reply to someone in a message takes me like 3 plus days.

3888
02:44:18,420 --> 02:44:23,060
You guys might notice on twitter how I reply to people like 5 plus days later.

3889
02:44:23,060 --> 02:44:26,760
And I just reply to people in like a binge.

3890
02:44:27,160 --> 02:44:32,120
So like, you would see me reply to like 10 plus people all at once.

3891
02:44:32,400 --> 02:44:37,700
And they'll range from replies from yesterday to replies from messages from like 10 plus days ago.

3892
02:44:37,860 --> 02:44:38,620
And I'm like sorry.

3893
02:44:39,120 --> 02:44:39,620
Hahaha.

3894
02:44:42,580 --> 02:44:44,220
So it really means a lot.

3895
02:44:45,960 --> 02:44:51,900
It really does mean a lot that you guys are writing the words D.

3896
02:44:51,900 --> 02:44:53,860
I am, I truly am.

3897
02:44:54,360 --> 02:44:56,080
I can't believe I'm so mad by Cam.

3898
02:44:56,200 --> 02:44:58,340
Good luck, keep your head up.

3899
02:44:58,380 --> 02:44:58,800
Have a good one.

3900
02:44:58,920 --> 02:44:59,160
Congratulations.

3901
02:45:00,380 --> 02:45:01,640
We love you all!

3902
02:45:01,980 --> 02:45:03,540
Thank you, thank you.

3903
02:45:03,700 --> 02:45:06,080
I really do appreciate you guys stopping by.

3904
02:45:06,460 --> 02:45:07,160
Really do.

3905
02:45:07,340 --> 02:45:09,920
Thank you for all for like hanging out this late.

3906
02:45:10,040 --> 02:45:13,420
I didn't think like the stream would go to this late already.

3907
02:45:13,820 --> 02:45:14,780
Thank you everyone.

3908
02:45:15,060 --> 02:45:17,900
But don't worry, we're almost to the... we're very close to the end.

3909
02:45:18,140 --> 02:45:19,900
We're very close to the end, guys.

3910
02:45:19,900 --> 02:45:20,640
Do not worry.

3911
02:45:24,400 --> 02:45:29,140
What are the things you wish you knew about VTubing and streaming before you started?

3912
02:45:29,280 --> 02:45:32,080
I'm debuting next month with no followers at all.

3913
02:45:32,160 --> 02:45:33,240
And I'm just really excited.

3914
02:45:33,580 --> 02:45:37,220
Just wanted to ask if you have any cardinal wisdom to best...

3915
02:45:38,100 --> 02:45:40,080
um... to best...

3916
02:45:40,080 --> 02:45:40,680
bestow.

3917
02:45:40,780 --> 02:45:41,720
I was like, best?

3918
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:42,520
Overwatch?

3919
02:45:44,020 --> 02:45:44,540
Bestow.

3920
02:45:44,700 --> 02:45:45,580
I was like...

3921
02:45:48,120 --> 02:45:54,280
And also in the few years I hope you can look back this chapter of your life and smile.

3922
02:45:54,500 --> 02:45:56,780
I think it's really cool what you've done and what you've built.

3923
02:45:56,880 --> 02:45:57,880
You will go far, okay?

3924
02:45:58,060 --> 02:45:59,420
Can't wait for the last stream.

3925
02:46:00,180 --> 02:46:01,140
Oh my gosh.

3926
02:46:01,460 --> 02:46:03,980
For your advice, not gonna lie...

3927
02:46:03,980 --> 02:46:05,800
Okay, this is what I'm gonna tell you guys.

3928
02:46:05,840 --> 02:46:07,120
You might be like, what are you talking about?

3929
02:46:07,320 --> 02:46:08,460
But I will tell you this.

3930
02:46:08,880 --> 02:46:09,820
I will tell you this.

3931
02:46:09,960 --> 02:46:14,120
Do the opposite of everything I've done with my streaming career.

3932
02:46:14,720 --> 02:46:15,120
.

3933
02:46:15,120 --> 02:46:15,500
.

3934
02:46:18,660 --> 02:46:19,200
.

3935
02:46:19,200 --> 02:46:20,880
I know you guys are like, what do you mean?

3936
02:46:21,120 --> 02:46:21,900
But I'm serious.

3937
02:46:22,160 --> 02:46:22,600
I'm serious.

3938
02:46:22,840 --> 02:46:27,140
Do the opposite of everything I've ever done with my streaming career.

3939
02:46:27,400 --> 02:46:32,800
Because what I do is very unconventional and that's why my growth has been very, very slow.

3940
02:46:33,140 --> 02:46:35,080
Because I don't really... I guess it's like...

3941
02:46:35,080 --> 02:46:39,320
It is sad that I did get rejected for Twitch Partner like 40 times.

3942
02:46:39,640 --> 02:46:41,440
But it's like I did this to myself.

3943
02:46:41,440 --> 02:46:41,980
.

3944
02:46:43,840 --> 02:46:44,980
I did this to myself.

3945
02:46:45,200 --> 02:46:52,020
So what I'm saying is that first off, the biggest issue with my... with how I stream is that I don't... I never...

3946
02:46:52,020 --> 02:46:59,720
Before I announced my graduation, I've never like told anyone what time I'll be streaming, what day I'll be streaming and when I do stream...

3947
02:46:59,720 --> 02:47:02,080
When I do stream, it's like 2am.

3948
02:47:02,300 --> 02:47:02,800
.

3949
02:47:05,440 --> 02:47:07,840
It's like 2 in the morning.

3950
02:47:08,240 --> 02:47:08,680
.

3951
02:47:09,320 --> 02:47:14,440
And usually, if you want to grow as a streamer, do not stream at 2am.

3952
02:47:14,840 --> 02:47:15,200
.

3953
02:47:18,300 --> 02:47:24,160
Like there are a few degenerates out there like me that are awake at that time and also the people on the other side of the world.

3954
02:47:24,480 --> 02:47:24,980
But...

3955
02:47:25,680 --> 02:47:28,240
But it's not very good in terms of growth.

3956
02:47:29,260 --> 02:47:31,640
It's not very good when it comes to...

3957
02:47:32,580 --> 02:47:34,880
comes to growing as a streamer.

3958
02:47:35,080 --> 02:47:35,480
.

3959
02:47:38,020 --> 02:47:39,880
And definitely don't...

3960
02:47:39,880 --> 02:47:40,680
Definitely...

3961
02:47:42,920 --> 02:47:43,820
Definitely like...

3962
02:47:43,820 --> 02:47:44,940
network more.

3963
02:47:45,200 --> 02:47:47,020
Me, I just... I was in the void.

3964
02:47:47,180 --> 02:47:49,900
I was in the void and locked in my discord.

3965
02:47:50,080 --> 02:47:53,440
I deleted all the doors in my discord in my streaming room.

3966
02:47:53,500 --> 02:47:55,680
So I never really like interact much with other...

3967
02:47:55,680 --> 02:47:56,740
Especially in VTubing.

3968
02:47:56,820 --> 02:47:58,680
VTubing is all about networking and collaboration.

3969
02:47:59,120 --> 02:47:59,820
Not me though.

3970
02:47:59,960 --> 02:48:02,400
I was like, I look at VTubing and I'm just like...

3971
02:48:02,400 --> 02:48:04,080
I wanna be pretty.

3972
02:48:04,300 --> 02:48:04,760
.

3973
02:48:06,380 --> 02:48:08,560
I wanna have so many outfits.

3974
02:48:09,240 --> 02:48:11,560
And then I just wanna talk to my chat.

3975
02:48:11,980 --> 02:48:12,740
.

3976
02:48:15,080 --> 02:48:15,740
But...

3977
02:48:16,980 --> 02:48:17,640
It's...

3978
02:48:17,640 --> 02:48:18,800
It's true though.

3979
02:48:18,980 --> 02:48:19,320
Like...

3980
02:48:19,970 --> 02:48:21,660
Collaboration and networking is such...

3981
02:48:21,660 --> 02:48:23,440
So important in VTubing.

3982
02:48:23,500 --> 02:48:27,560
And I... That's all for so... That definitely affected my growth as a streamer.

3983
02:48:27,680 --> 02:48:29,780
Um... Cause I've been streaming on...

3984
02:48:29,780 --> 02:48:32,920
Well, last year I've been streaming consistently since 2020.

3985
02:48:33,790 --> 02:48:35,820
Um... Since the beginning of 2020 was like...

3986
02:48:35,820 --> 02:48:37,460
When I started consistently streaming.

3987
02:48:38,040 --> 02:48:39,500
And... Uh... I...

3988
02:48:39,500 --> 02:48:41,260
But I started streaming in 2017.

3989
02:48:41,980 --> 02:48:45,960
But it's just that I was so sporadic with my streams that...

3990
02:48:45,960 --> 02:48:47,960
Um... That like I would go...

3991
02:48:47,960 --> 02:48:49,300
Like I said, I would go on to this...

3992
02:48:49,800 --> 02:48:51,560
Uh... Really... Uh...

3993
02:48:51,560 --> 02:48:53,060
I'd go on to this...

3994
02:48:53,060 --> 02:48:56,340
Uh... Really like... Sporadic hiatuses and everything.

3995
02:48:56,560 --> 02:48:58,340
So that affected my growth and all.

3996
02:48:58,520 --> 02:48:59,520
I gotta stream consistently.

3997
02:49:00,280 --> 02:49:02,260
And... Yeah... Like those are my advice.

3998
02:49:02,280 --> 02:49:03,100
Stream consistently.

3999
02:49:03,860 --> 02:49:06,180
Uh... Do not stream at 2 in the morning.

4000
02:49:06,420 --> 02:49:06,860
.

4001
02:49:09,800 --> 02:49:10,620
Collaborate in networking.

4002
02:49:10,860 --> 02:49:14,140
I feel like at this day and age it's all about networking now.

4003
02:49:14,600 --> 02:49:16,660
Um... Like it when streamer reads their messages.

4004
02:49:16,900 --> 02:49:17,340
.

4005
02:49:18,700 --> 02:49:19,900
I love reading messages.

4006
02:49:20,140 --> 02:49:22,700
I always make sure to try and read all your messages guys.

4007
02:49:22,780 --> 02:49:24,220
I'm sorry if I ever missed any cause...

4008
02:49:24,220 --> 02:49:25,960
Cause like I... I... I don't know.

4009
02:49:26,040 --> 02:49:27,780
I was busy reading the Bee Movie script.

4010
02:49:28,040 --> 02:49:28,400
.

4011
02:49:29,820 --> 02:49:32,060
The Bee Movie script has...

4012
02:49:32,060 --> 02:49:34,980
Has made me very preoccupied as you guys know.

4013
02:49:35,260 --> 02:49:35,620
.

4014
02:49:36,860 --> 02:49:37,180
.

4015
02:49:39,380 --> 02:49:41,760
So I'm glad you guys uh...

4016
02:49:42,720 --> 02:49:44,600
Enjoyed your time in my community.

4017
02:49:44,820 --> 02:49:46,180
And with your cousins!

4018
02:49:47,240 --> 02:49:47,380
.

4019
02:49:47,960 --> 02:49:50,520
You get to my message in 2 to 3 days.

4020
02:49:50,860 --> 02:49:54,240
So thank you everyone for just being there with me.

4021
02:49:54,680 --> 02:49:56,760
And it really does mean a lot.

4022
02:49:57,040 --> 02:49:58,260
It really does guys.

4023
02:49:59,360 --> 02:49:59,540
.

4024
02:49:59,540 --> 02:50:02,660
So... Yeah just do the opposite of everything I've ever done.

4025
02:50:02,900 --> 02:50:03,300
.

4026
02:50:03,300 --> 02:50:05,240
As my streaming career.

4027
02:50:06,860 --> 02:50:08,440
You too can become a Twitch Partner.

4028
02:50:08,940 --> 02:50:09,400
.

4029
02:50:10,020 --> 02:50:13,020
And don't send them the Bee Movie script in your application.

4030
02:50:13,380 --> 02:50:13,720
.

4031
02:50:14,280 --> 02:50:19,660
Clearly I don't think they like the Bee Movie script very much in my Twitch Partner application guys.

4032
02:50:19,920 --> 02:50:20,340
.

4033
02:50:23,380 --> 02:50:24,420
Don't do that too.

4034
02:50:24,620 --> 02:50:25,420
Don't do that.

4035
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:26,460
.

4036
02:50:27,660 --> 02:50:31,780
Even as a certain meeting it's been fun watching your stream for 2 months.

4037
02:50:31,900 --> 02:50:33,360
And times went fast.

4038
02:50:33,860 --> 02:50:38,380
It's kind of sad that you'll be graduating but it's your choice and we can stop you from doing what you want.

4039
02:50:38,520 --> 02:50:41,920
And finally good luck from your journey.

4040
02:50:42,100 --> 02:50:43,680
Thank you DG3.

4041
02:50:44,020 --> 02:50:45,880
Thank you everyone for the well wishes.

4042
02:50:46,080 --> 02:50:46,920
Thank you all.

4043
02:50:47,380 --> 02:50:48,260
Thank you all.

4044
02:50:48,300 --> 02:50:52,260
If I wasn't graduating I would definitely write in my application World of Cousins!

4045
02:50:53,040 --> 02:50:53,520
.

4046
02:50:53,520 --> 02:50:53,540
.

4047
02:50:53,540 --> 02:50:53,640
.

4048
02:50:59,120 --> 02:51:01,640
But sadly I don't have a 5th attempt.

4049
02:51:01,860 --> 02:51:03,740
I don't have a 5th attempt on that.

4050
02:51:04,100 --> 02:51:04,440
.

4051
02:51:04,440 --> 02:51:10,340
How active are you gonna be after your last stream?

4052
02:51:10,400 --> 02:51:14,600
Are you just gonna disappear and you wanna see in other streams?

4053
02:51:14,920 --> 02:51:15,420
Who knows?

4054
02:51:15,580 --> 02:51:17,820
It's really hard to stream when you're on the run you know.

4055
02:51:17,980 --> 02:51:22,760
It's really hard to do anything when you're fucking running from the cops guys.

4056
02:51:22,920 --> 02:51:23,200
.

4057
02:51:24,900 --> 02:51:27,040
Have you ever tried motel internet?

4058
02:51:28,740 --> 02:51:30,740
Do the motels have internet guys?

4059
02:51:30,920 --> 02:51:32,340
Do the motels have internet guys?

4060
02:51:32,580 --> 02:51:33,780
I don't even know.

4061
02:51:34,020 --> 02:51:35,280
I'll find out later.

4062
02:51:35,440 --> 02:51:43,040
I'll find out Thank you for the 13 months at tier 1!

4063
02:51:43,420 --> 02:51:44,120
Thank you!

4064
02:51:44,340 --> 02:51:52,080
Can we get some bark nights real quick for Gilgamesh for the 13 months at tier 1.

4065
02:51:52,360 --> 02:51:53,400
Thank you, thank you!

4066
02:51:53,820 --> 02:51:55,680
I really do appreciate it guys.

4067
02:51:55,860 --> 02:51:56,960
Thank you so much.

4068
02:51:57,180 --> 02:51:58,180
Thank you, thank you everyone!

4069
02:51:59,900 --> 02:52:01,740
The final bark nights.

4070
02:52:02,120 --> 02:52:03,720
The final bark nights.

4071
02:52:04,720 --> 02:52:05,720
Hello Doki!

4072
02:52:05,940 --> 02:52:11,220
Seeing as you seem to be leaving forever, I just want to thank you.

4073
02:52:11,600 --> 02:52:16,740
My sister passed away in November, but it didn't truly hit me until much more recently.

4074
02:52:17,140 --> 02:52:22,580
Among other things, your streams and videos kept me happy and distracted me from making any rash decisions.

4075
02:52:23,120 --> 02:52:25,520
To put it bluntly, you saved my life.

4076
02:52:25,640 --> 02:52:30,820
I decided to turn my life around on April 19th, and I felt so much better since then.

4077
02:52:31,020 --> 02:52:33,540
Why doubt I ever would have had the chance to do so?

4078
02:52:33,720 --> 02:52:34,520
If it hadn't been you.

4079
02:52:34,660 --> 02:52:41,340
Your personality, charm, and infectious laugh has been the highlight of the last 7 months I spent watching you.

4080
02:52:41,520 --> 02:52:46,300
And I can never thank you enough for truly reminding me that life is indeed worth living.

4081
02:52:46,640 --> 02:52:49,500
I will miss you forever and never stop loving you.

4082
02:52:50,620 --> 02:52:51,180
Awwww...

4083
02:52:52,100 --> 02:52:53,740
Hopefully that last part wasn't creepy.

4084
02:52:54,420 --> 02:52:54,980
No!

4085
02:52:57,800 --> 02:52:59,860
But... but... oh my god.

4086
02:53:00,740 --> 02:53:03,180
Ah, do you ever... do you ever...

4087
02:53:03,720 --> 02:53:07,180
Do you ever sense that I'm so happy that I was able to...

4088
02:53:08,120 --> 02:53:10,000
I was able to help you there.

4089
02:53:10,360 --> 02:53:14,520
I'm very happy to be there for you during your dark times.

4090
02:53:15,080 --> 02:53:16,720
I'm just happy to...

4091
02:53:17,460 --> 02:53:17,940
Uh...

4092
02:53:18,700 --> 02:53:20,180
I'm just happy...

4093
02:53:20,180 --> 02:53:21,560
I love you, have a good rest of your graduation.

4094
02:53:21,780 --> 02:53:23,040
Awwww thank you, I love you better!

4095
02:53:23,800 --> 02:53:24,680
Thank you!

4096
02:53:25,560 --> 02:53:27,700
I'm just happy that...

4097
02:53:28,380 --> 02:53:28,860
Uh...

4098
02:53:28,860 --> 02:53:32,040
I was able to help you there during your rough time.

4099
02:53:32,040 --> 02:53:35,320
And I was able to cheer you up during that time.

4100
02:53:35,460 --> 02:53:37,340
I just... like I said, I know I keep saying, but...

4101
02:53:38,020 --> 02:53:40,220
Every... I just... I just love making people...

4102
02:53:41,820 --> 02:53:42,180
Um...

4103
02:53:42,180 --> 02:53:42,960
Um... laugh.

4104
02:53:43,160 --> 02:53:46,900
And it's just... I'm just happy that I was able to do that.

4105
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:49,740
I'm really happy to be able to do that for all of you.

4106
02:53:50,020 --> 02:53:54,400
And really... I... I just want you guys to feel better after that day.

4107
02:53:54,740 --> 02:53:55,820
And I think that's like...

4108
02:53:55,820 --> 02:53:57,240
People will be like, why do you laugh so much?

4109
02:53:57,420 --> 02:53:59,080
And I'll be like, what's wrong with you?

4110
02:53:59,100 --> 02:53:59,420
Like what?

4111
02:53:59,500 --> 02:54:00,640
You don't like to be happy?

4112
02:54:00,640 --> 02:54:01,680
Man, I'm sorry.

4113
02:54:02,400 --> 02:54:04,240
Like... like you're like...

4114
02:54:04,240 --> 02:54:05,560
What's wrong with laughing?

4115
02:54:05,720 --> 02:54:07,540
Is laughing your allergy?

4116
02:54:08,100 --> 02:54:08,500
Oh!

4117
02:54:10,780 --> 02:54:12,400
Hope you die in game!

4118
02:54:13,860 --> 02:54:16,000
From me laughing too much!

4119
02:54:16,780 --> 02:54:19,100
Like, I'm just happy that...

4120
02:54:19,100 --> 02:54:21,140
I was able to...

4121
02:54:21,140 --> 02:54:23,300
Uh... make you guys laugh.

4122
02:54:24,340 --> 02:54:26,280
And... I'm... I... it's really...

4123
02:54:26,280 --> 02:54:28,140
That's really all I wanted to do for you guys.

4124
02:54:28,300 --> 02:54:28,980
That's really it.

4125
02:54:29,200 --> 02:54:30,620
Like, I start my stream being...

4126
02:54:30,620 --> 02:54:32,260
Like, don't like me having to do Overwatch.

4127
02:54:32,640 --> 02:54:34,420
Someone did an uninstall Overwatch!

4128
02:54:34,740 --> 02:54:35,360
I see!

4129
02:54:36,100 --> 02:54:36,560
Hehehehe.

4130
02:54:37,340 --> 02:54:37,800
Alright.

4131
02:54:39,360 --> 02:54:39,820
Honestly...

4132
02:54:39,820 --> 02:54:40,420
Hey Doki.

4133
02:54:40,500 --> 02:54:43,280
Honestly, I didn't think I'd get emotional over this.

4134
02:54:43,520 --> 02:54:46,200
As I've been able to be very active for now and now.

4135
02:54:46,280 --> 02:54:47,400
Because of IRL stuff.

4136
02:54:47,660 --> 02:54:50,260
But wow, I'm literally tearing up writing this out.

4137
02:54:50,480 --> 02:54:53,060
I'm so happy to have had all these memories with you.

4138
02:54:53,220 --> 02:54:57,560
I still have the songs that I listened to because of your old playlist before Twitch DMCA.

4139
02:54:57,820 --> 02:54:59,740
I wish I could have edited for you more.

4140
02:54:59,740 --> 02:55:00,720
And I know about this.

4141
02:55:00,800 --> 02:55:03,940
I would hunt them 10 million thousand times.

4142
02:55:04,760 --> 02:55:05,160
Made...

4143
02:55:05,160 --> 02:55:06,000
This is an estimate.

4144
02:55:06,520 --> 02:55:10,780
I made more time to be able to make more memories with you.

4145
02:55:10,860 --> 02:55:15,120
I honestly will cherish this time of my life that we all got to spend together.

4146
02:55:15,520 --> 02:55:17,880
And I hope the same is for you, Sparrow.

4147
02:55:18,420 --> 02:55:20,100
Ah, you guys don't know who Sparrow is.

4148
02:55:20,180 --> 02:55:21,880
He's also been in the community for a very long time.

4149
02:55:22,100 --> 02:55:24,020
He's been there with us for very, very long.

4150
02:55:24,260 --> 02:55:25,740
And since the Overwatch game.

4151
02:55:25,780 --> 02:55:28,020
He's also the one that's edited a lot of our videos too.

4152
02:55:28,080 --> 02:55:28,600
On YouTube.

4153
02:55:29,140 --> 02:55:29,660
So...

4154
02:55:29,660 --> 02:55:31,740
I don't know if Sparrow is here right now.

4155
02:55:32,180 --> 02:55:36,900
Because he's been very busy lately with his school and work.

4156
02:55:39,240 --> 02:55:39,760
So...

4157
02:55:39,760 --> 02:55:44,880
It's really sweet that he managed to send a message in before the end.

4158
02:55:45,160 --> 02:55:46,700
And I'm going to miss him.

4159
02:55:46,900 --> 02:55:48,760
He has done so much for the community too.

4160
02:55:48,860 --> 02:55:49,920
He's also one of our mods.

4161
02:55:50,420 --> 02:55:52,140
He's also one of our mods too.

4162
02:55:52,640 --> 02:55:55,020
We'll miss your energy and that sweet laughter.

4163
02:55:56,680 --> 02:55:57,720
Thank you.

4164
02:55:57,800 --> 02:55:58,580
Whoever that was.

4165
02:55:58,580 --> 02:55:59,480
Thank you.

4166
02:56:00,260 --> 02:56:03,580
I'm going to miss your stream so much that you're such a positive ball of energy.

4167
02:56:03,720 --> 02:56:05,200
And I hope the future is kind to you.

4168
02:56:05,260 --> 02:56:07,260
Wherever it is that you're going to pursue.

4169
02:56:07,560 --> 02:56:09,460
May include making tomatoes extinct.

4170
02:56:09,640 --> 02:56:11,540
Don't get the last tomato.

4171
02:56:13,700 --> 02:56:15,580
Just wiped out tomato town.

4172
02:56:15,840 --> 02:56:16,440
Who's next?

4173
02:56:19,240 --> 02:56:21,820
Been a follower ever since your Overwatch days.

4174
02:56:22,040 --> 02:56:24,140
And I'm glad I stayed for the journey.

4175
02:56:24,360 --> 02:56:24,800
Chuki.

4176
02:56:25,040 --> 02:56:26,120
Thank you Chuki.

4177
02:56:26,640 --> 02:56:28,420
Thank you for everyone that stayed.

4178
02:56:28,420 --> 02:56:29,680
Since my Overwatch days.

4179
02:56:29,820 --> 02:56:34,940
It's really crazy because I went through so many different phases in my streaming career.

4180
02:56:35,120 --> 02:56:37,020
Like I went through different things I want to do.

4181
02:56:37,200 --> 02:56:38,900
Because I didn't know what I wanted to do.

4182
02:56:39,120 --> 02:56:40,740
I went through like Splatoon, Overwatch.

4183
02:56:41,540 --> 02:56:43,000
Remember when I used to be an artist?

4184
02:56:43,480 --> 02:56:44,220
I don't think we...

4185
02:56:44,220 --> 02:56:46,820
When was the last time I drew for you guys?

4186
02:56:47,140 --> 02:56:48,240
Because I was like, you know what?

4187
02:56:48,280 --> 02:56:49,840
I'm just going to talk to my chat.

4188
02:56:50,280 --> 02:56:51,960
I'm just going to talk to my stream.

4189
02:56:52,240 --> 02:56:55,780
Because I was like, I'm really just talking anyway.

4190
02:56:56,140 --> 02:56:58,020
I was really just talking anyways.

4191
02:56:58,020 --> 02:57:00,140
So I might as well just ditch the whole art part.

4192
02:57:04,220 --> 02:57:04,740
That's you.

4193
02:57:04,820 --> 02:57:07,320
You never drew during the art team.

4194
02:57:07,460 --> 02:57:08,000
That's you.

4195
02:57:08,060 --> 02:57:09,360
I just wanted to be in the art category.

4196
02:57:09,660 --> 02:57:12,360
I just wanted to be in the art category.

4197
02:57:16,880 --> 02:57:17,320
Alright.

4198
02:57:17,840 --> 02:57:19,420
And after this we refresh.

4199
02:57:21,180 --> 02:57:22,180
Hello there traveler.

4200
02:57:22,460 --> 02:57:23,380
How are you doing?

4201
02:57:23,520 --> 02:57:24,460
Hope you're doing well.

4202
02:57:24,620 --> 02:57:25,860
I'm mad at saying goodbye.

4203
02:57:26,220 --> 02:57:27,900
My brain does not function properly.

4204
02:57:28,020 --> 02:57:30,140
So I'm just going to blurt out some words then.

4205
02:57:30,820 --> 02:57:31,960
Where did it begin then?

4206
02:57:32,140 --> 02:57:34,460
I still remember I found out about your channel during quarantine.

4207
02:57:35,120 --> 02:57:38,180
The pure chaotic energy was a breath of fresh air.

4208
02:57:38,380 --> 02:57:40,920
It is true that I was not an active member of the community.

4209
02:57:41,060 --> 02:57:42,160
Not that I was active all the time.

4210
02:57:42,380 --> 02:57:48,180
But believe me, I loved all the stream I was able to see and enjoyed every second of it.

4211
02:57:48,360 --> 02:57:49,100
Loved your art.

4212
02:57:49,180 --> 02:57:49,840
Loved your PP.

4213
02:57:49,940 --> 02:57:52,280
But most importantly, loved you as a person.

4214
02:57:52,360 --> 02:57:53,440
It hurts to see you go.

4215
02:57:53,560 --> 02:57:54,760
But I respect your decision.

4216
02:57:55,820 --> 02:57:58,000
Whatever you do next, just know that we will always be there for you.

4217
02:57:58,000 --> 02:58:01,440
We will always support you until the next blue moon rises and night is bright.

4218
02:58:01,600 --> 02:58:02,720
Until the night is tight.

4219
02:58:03,140 --> 02:58:03,580
Goodbye.

4220
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:05,960
If you decide to go on Heist again, do more PP.

4221
02:58:06,020 --> 02:58:08,240
Just know that we will be waiting here for you.

4222
02:58:08,440 --> 02:58:10,380
Let God cross your path once again.

4223
02:58:10,440 --> 02:58:12,400
Until then, goodbye for the last time.

4224
02:58:13,820 --> 02:58:15,900
Thank you for whoever wrote that.

4225
02:58:16,240 --> 02:58:19,080
Like I said guys, I will miss you guys so much.

4226
02:58:19,240 --> 02:58:22,320
And I'm glad I made such an impact on all of you.

4227
02:58:23,360 --> 02:58:24,300
Don't forget me.

4228
02:58:27,080 --> 02:58:27,980
If you closed your eyes, I will be there for you.

4229
02:58:33,760 --> 02:58:34,720
Thank you.

4230
02:58:34,940 --> 02:58:36,760
Yeah, there will be more.

4231
02:58:37,880 --> 02:58:39,280
There will be more guys.

4232
02:58:39,500 --> 02:58:39,920
Don't worry.

4233
02:58:39,980 --> 02:58:41,240
I'm just going to refresh this now.

4234
02:58:41,740 --> 02:58:43,380
But thank you whoever wrote this.

4235
02:58:43,480 --> 02:58:45,060
That was such a sweet message.

4236
02:58:45,160 --> 02:58:46,640
Thank you to whoever it was.

4237
02:58:47,520 --> 02:58:50,200
I see that we wrote some nice words as well.

4238
02:58:51,720 --> 02:58:53,900
Alright, let's scroll back up.

4239
02:58:54,120 --> 02:58:55,500
Oh my gosh, 10 more.

4240
02:58:55,700 --> 02:58:56,940
10 more.

4241
02:58:57,400 --> 02:58:57,880
10 more.

4242
02:58:57,880 --> 02:58:57,960
10 more.

4243
02:58:57,960 --> 02:59:00,100
Oh, you guys are so sweet everyone.

4244
02:59:00,760 --> 02:59:01,640
Thank you.

4245
02:59:02,280 --> 02:59:03,160
Thank you.

4246
02:59:03,460 --> 02:59:04,460
It's so sweet.

4247
02:59:04,540 --> 02:59:06,520
Eddie, thank you for the five bitties.

4248
02:59:06,640 --> 02:59:07,640
Thank you.

4249
02:59:08,180 --> 02:59:08,920
Thank you.

4250
02:59:09,440 --> 02:59:14,080
We prepared something special for your fans who will join me in the burstless and discord with...

4251
02:59:14,080 --> 02:59:15,020
Oh, okay.

4252
02:59:15,260 --> 02:59:17,140
Okay, I guess we're joining in the...

4253
02:59:17,140 --> 02:59:18,480
Oh, but I don't...

4254
02:59:18,480 --> 02:59:20,600
If you're sharing a video to me, I don't know if I can...

4255
02:59:20,600 --> 02:59:24,640
Can I share a video that's shared on the discord?

4256
02:59:24,840 --> 02:59:26,720
Is it possible to share that?

4257
02:59:26,820 --> 02:59:27,320
Oh, you guys are so sweet everyone.

4258
02:59:28,180 --> 02:59:29,020
I don't know.

4259
02:59:29,160 --> 02:59:31,080
I've never tried that before, guys.

4260
02:59:31,400 --> 02:59:32,780
I've never tried that.

4261
02:59:32,920 --> 02:59:33,200
Should be.

4262
02:59:33,620 --> 02:59:34,060
Okay.

4263
02:59:34,700 --> 02:59:36,360
Alright, alright, I'll do that then.

4264
02:59:39,100 --> 02:59:44,520
Hey Doki, I'm making this while you read the messages that everyone gave you and hear last.

4265
02:59:44,700 --> 02:59:48,740
It really makes me sad that I'll not hear it no more, but because it's different when it's in the moment.

4266
02:59:48,900 --> 02:59:49,760
Ah, words.

4267
02:59:50,040 --> 02:59:54,120
Just saying it was fun watching and hearing your loud, aggressive, and energetic voice.

4268
02:59:54,320 --> 02:59:57,340
I hope to see your twin in the infinite doors of opportunity.

4269
02:59:57,360 --> 02:59:57,520
Okay, you guys are so sweet!

4270
02:59:58,420 --> 03:00:01,380
What are you talking about?

4271
03:00:01,440 --> 03:00:01,780
What twin?

4272
03:00:01,880 --> 03:00:02,720
I'm an only child.

4273
03:00:03,280 --> 03:00:04,460
I'm an only child.

4274
03:00:05,420 --> 03:00:06,400
What twin?

4275
03:00:06,840 --> 03:00:09,040
We never had... I never had a twin.

4276
03:00:09,600 --> 03:00:11,060
Not since 2014.

4277
03:00:12,200 --> 03:00:13,720
Not since 2014.

4278
03:00:16,600 --> 03:00:18,700
But thank you, thank you.

4279
03:00:19,840 --> 03:00:21,320
This stream is last minute.

4280
03:00:21,400 --> 03:00:22,680
I'm so sorry about that.

4281
03:00:22,800 --> 03:00:27,260
Though I did not speak a lot in chat, I would like to thank you for your time and effort you put into your stream.

4282
03:00:27,260 --> 03:00:30,360
I found you through a rain and I'm extremely happy that I stayed.

4283
03:00:30,540 --> 03:00:34,120
I want to thank you for all the laughter you brought to us.

4284
03:00:34,240 --> 03:00:37,660
I'll always remember the first movie night I hopped in to watch Souls with the community.

4285
03:00:37,940 --> 03:00:42,940
But nonetheless, I hope you have a happy graduation and I wish you the best on your new path of life.

4286
03:00:43,140 --> 03:00:45,380
I wish I'd learn about you sooner and talked more.

4287
03:00:45,540 --> 03:00:48,680
But as for now, I know you will be remembered and I hope you remember us too.

4288
03:00:48,780 --> 03:00:50,360
Of course I'll remember you guys!

4289
03:00:51,160 --> 03:00:51,560
Chat!

4290
03:00:52,140 --> 03:00:53,040
Of course!

4291
03:00:53,220 --> 03:00:54,540
Oh well, I'm so happy.

4292
03:00:54,560 --> 03:00:56,040
I'm so happy even the movie nights.

4293
03:00:56,300 --> 03:00:56,700
Even...

4294
03:00:56,700 --> 03:01:00,680
Like during movie nights, you guys all had an amazing time.

4295
03:01:01,660 --> 03:01:05,560
Because every time in movie nights, I try to be as involved as much as possible.

4296
03:01:05,720 --> 03:01:09,080
I even like paid to watch the movies legally for all of you.

4297
03:01:09,860 --> 03:01:13,540
Sometimes I would pay like 20 plus dollars to watch it legally.

4298
03:01:13,820 --> 03:01:17,600
Because it would be like, like Soul, I had to buy the ticket.

4299
03:01:20,040 --> 03:01:20,800
Or Raya.

4300
03:01:21,860 --> 03:01:24,340
But I am so happy that you guys all enjoyed.

4301
03:01:25,300 --> 03:01:26,680
All enjoyed the...

4302
03:01:27,520 --> 03:01:28,000
Riptrolls.

4303
03:01:28,000 --> 03:01:32,560
I bought, I even paid for trolls and that was the best decision of my life.

4304
03:01:34,540 --> 03:01:36,680
You wouldn't download a car!

4305
03:01:38,340 --> 03:01:40,600
That ad traumatized me!

4306
03:01:44,520 --> 03:01:46,080
But I'm glad you all enjoyed.

4307
03:01:46,240 --> 03:01:47,100
Especially movie night.

4308
03:01:47,100 --> 03:01:48,300
Movie night was so fun too.

4309
03:01:49,680 --> 03:01:52,060
Well movie night was so fun with all of you.

4310
03:01:52,160 --> 03:01:53,180
It was, it was.

4311
03:01:56,020 --> 03:01:56,680
I'll miss you guys!

4312
03:02:18,280 --> 03:02:21,800
Thank you, everyone.

4313
03:02:23,220 --> 03:02:26,040
And thank you for the other 8 bits.

4314
03:02:26,280 --> 03:02:27,700
Thank you so much.

4315
03:02:32,660 --> 03:02:34,300
Thank you Scooby too.

4316
03:02:39,740 --> 03:02:40,240
That's it.

4317
03:02:40,320 --> 03:02:43,240
Thank you so much, Ninja, for such a sweet message.

4318
03:02:43,520 --> 03:02:45,460
And thank you for all the stuff you've done.

4319
03:02:45,620 --> 03:02:50,420
Even though you've only been here for a short time, you really did leave an impact on all of us.

4320
03:02:50,460 --> 03:02:52,760
Especially the fun one.

4321
03:02:54,420 --> 03:02:57,980
The 1v1s we had and the 8 packs.

4322
03:03:01,640 --> 03:03:09,960
And the great big donation that you made for all of us, for food and Food Banks of Canada.

4323
03:03:10,180 --> 03:03:12,680
It really does mean a lot.

4324
03:03:13,020 --> 03:03:16,120
And the donation you did yesterday too.

4325
03:03:16,420 --> 03:03:17,780
Or two days ago.

4326
03:03:18,020 --> 03:03:19,940
Oh my gosh, thank you, Ninja.

4327
03:03:20,160 --> 03:03:23,540
It really was...

4328
03:03:23,540 --> 03:03:26,980
I'm so happy that you're all part of this community, guys.

4329
03:03:27,100 --> 03:03:30,120
Thank you for making this such an amazing community for me.

4330
03:03:30,320 --> 03:03:32,720
And an amazing community for all of you.

4331
03:03:35,480 --> 03:03:37,980
Hey Doki, it's your boy, Elsart.

4332
03:03:38,100 --> 03:03:39,740
Just wanted to say I miss you so very much.

4333
03:03:39,880 --> 03:03:45,160
Seeing that message for the final stream made me go in denial for a while until I made peace and want you to succeed.

4334
03:03:45,640 --> 03:03:49,200
I'm happy I found you on Recommended randomly at 2am.

4335
03:03:49,380 --> 03:03:51,520
Spending so much time even though I've missed most of the stream.

4336
03:03:51,520 --> 03:03:53,380
I have to watch the VODs when I can.

4337
03:03:53,600 --> 03:03:56,520
When today finally came, no lie, I cried home, mom.

4338
03:03:56,660 --> 03:03:58,320
And I got home from work.

4339
03:03:58,680 --> 03:04:01,460
I'll say that you made my nights amazing when I came by.

4340
03:04:01,600 --> 03:04:07,200
The smile you put on my face made my mouth hurt from smiling and trying not to laugh hard at 3 in the morning.

4341
03:04:07,440 --> 03:04:09,400
I'm gonna miss your streams.

4342
03:04:09,460 --> 03:04:13,580
Gonna miss hearing the jokes, the stories, chaotic energy, and of course your laughter.

4343
03:04:13,800 --> 03:04:16,280
Who knew that you could make me cry so hard for these 3 hours?

4344
03:04:16,360 --> 03:04:17,880
My mouth is being blistered when I wake up.

4345
03:04:18,000 --> 03:04:20,140
I wish you the best of luck.

4346
03:04:20,240 --> 03:04:21,380
And know that my eyes will be with you.

4347
03:04:21,380 --> 03:04:21,920
In your heart.

4348
03:04:21,980 --> 03:04:22,420
Love you.

4349
03:04:22,440 --> 03:04:25,040
Doki from all the many work nights.

4350
03:04:26,900 --> 03:04:28,820
Aw, thank you.

4351
03:04:29,560 --> 03:04:30,480
Thank you.

4352
03:04:30,520 --> 03:04:31,320
Thank you.

4353
03:04:31,540 --> 03:04:32,460
I'm sorry.

4354
03:04:32,680 --> 03:04:35,520
Thank you for such a sweet message.

4355
03:04:35,840 --> 03:04:36,120
Yeah.

4356
03:04:36,920 --> 03:04:39,160
I wonder how many people I...

4357
03:04:39,160 --> 03:04:45,700
How many people's parents or significant others or roommates I've woken up because of my laugh.

4358
03:04:47,340 --> 03:04:50,080
Especially when I stream at 3 in the morning.

4359
03:04:50,080 --> 03:04:56,060
I wonder how many of you guys accidentally woke up like whoever you're living with because of me.

4360
03:04:57,720 --> 03:04:58,280
Yes.

4361
03:04:58,620 --> 03:04:59,760
3 in time.

4362
03:04:59,880 --> 03:05:01,080
Time to get in trouble.

4363
03:05:04,880 --> 03:05:06,060
And we saw that.

4364
03:05:06,160 --> 03:05:07,860
That way I can go away bleeding that.

4365
03:05:08,320 --> 03:05:12,040
I switched my headphones up at 1 am.

4366
03:05:12,360 --> 03:05:14,840
I'm glad I have headphones on at all times.

4367
03:05:17,720 --> 03:05:19,080
It's a night terror.

4368
03:05:20,120 --> 03:05:24,340
I think you woke up my aunt.

4369
03:05:24,760 --> 03:05:28,000
I don't know what to put on my headphones.

4370
03:05:28,340 --> 03:05:29,940
I remember someone was like...

4371
03:05:29,940 --> 03:05:31,020
Someone was like...

4372
03:05:31,020 --> 03:05:33,060
Came to my chat and was like...

4373
03:05:33,060 --> 03:05:34,860
I heard my boyfriend laughing.

4374
03:05:35,580 --> 03:05:37,520
And I knew it was from your stream.

4375
03:05:38,000 --> 03:05:39,440
And I was like, whoops.

4376
03:05:42,680 --> 03:05:44,180
I was like...

4377
03:05:44,180 --> 03:05:45,740
And she was like, I was trying to sleep.

4378
03:05:47,820 --> 03:05:49,240
I don't remember who it was.

4379
03:05:49,420 --> 03:05:50,460
I wish I remember.

4380
03:05:50,680 --> 03:05:51,380
I thought it was so funny.

4381
03:05:51,460 --> 03:05:53,600
I was like, I'm so sorry for waking you up.

4382
03:05:53,660 --> 03:05:54,500
I'm so sorry.

4383
03:05:56,480 --> 03:05:58,840
She was like, I knew she was watching your stream.

4384
03:05:58,980 --> 03:06:00,040
Because you woke me up.

4385
03:06:02,140 --> 03:06:04,760
You woke my roommate in that massage stream.

4386
03:06:07,200 --> 03:06:09,020
It was like the funniest shit.

4387
03:06:10,440 --> 03:06:11,160
Moving talkie.

4388
03:06:11,240 --> 03:06:13,260
And I forgot to make my day riding.

4389
03:06:13,480 --> 03:06:14,220
Asking what was on.

4390
03:06:14,220 --> 03:06:15,420
Because I heard doki screeching.

4391
03:06:15,480 --> 03:06:17,660
I have open back headphones.

4392
03:06:17,740 --> 03:06:20,100
So I haven't been able to hear the crazy laugh from another room.

4393
03:06:20,300 --> 03:06:22,560
When I went up to do one thing or another.

4394
03:06:23,000 --> 03:06:24,860
And I have my doki's laugh.

4395
03:06:25,720 --> 03:06:28,820
I got yelled at by my parents for laughing too hard from your streams.

4396
03:06:29,020 --> 03:06:34,200
Yeah, I feel like everyone has gotten either like reprimanded or yelled at because of me.

4397
03:06:34,280 --> 03:06:35,100
I'm sorry.

4398
03:06:35,320 --> 03:06:36,280
But not really.

4399
03:06:36,900 --> 03:06:38,140
I mean, I got annoyed.

4400
03:06:38,320 --> 03:06:39,020
You can't believe it.

4401
03:06:39,960 --> 03:06:41,440
Everyone is living me as annoyed at your laugh.

4402
03:06:41,520 --> 03:06:43,100
They need to hear it the most.

4403
03:06:43,100 --> 03:06:44,160
Ah, yes.

4404
03:06:44,700 --> 03:06:45,320
What's it called?

4405
03:06:45,480 --> 03:06:46,260
Stockholm syndrome.

4406
03:06:46,440 --> 03:06:49,020
I'm just going to give whoever it is Stockholm syndrome.

4407
03:06:53,440 --> 03:06:54,240
Hi again.

4408
03:06:54,440 --> 03:06:57,100
One second marshmallow message before the end.

4409
03:06:57,220 --> 03:06:59,480
I'm really super happy that I got to fly on your stream.

4410
03:06:59,900 --> 03:07:02,020
Although I haven't been coming as often as I would like.

4411
03:07:02,100 --> 03:07:04,140
I'm always so happy to feel so welcomed by you.

4412
03:07:04,200 --> 03:07:06,780
Thank you for being so amazingly kind and funny to yourself.

4413
03:07:06,940 --> 03:07:09,560
One of your moments was when I said fuck you.

4414
03:07:09,620 --> 03:07:10,080
Oh dear.

4415
03:07:10,280 --> 03:07:12,460
I should have stopped laughing and just said it out loud.

4416
03:07:12,460 --> 03:07:13,440
I didn't know how hilarious and goofy you are.

4417
03:07:13,500 --> 03:07:18,360
I wish I didn't have to see you leave because I always wanted to be able to see you having fun with the bark knights.

4418
03:07:18,920 --> 03:07:22,240
I'm going to miss hearing your laugh and witty humor.

4419
03:07:22,400 --> 03:07:23,280
Please take care of yourself.

4420
03:07:23,320 --> 03:07:27,800
And even though you're going to be leaving this discord, please feel free to come back and hang out with all of us again.

4421
03:07:28,080 --> 03:07:30,580
We're seriously going to miss you so very much.

4422
03:07:30,900 --> 03:07:32,340
Thief of bark knight hearts.

4423
03:07:32,620 --> 03:07:33,460
Take care again.

4424
03:07:33,700 --> 03:07:35,560
You'll destroy something with your...

4425
03:07:36,580 --> 03:07:38,200
About that, I...

4426
03:07:38,960 --> 03:07:40,560
It did not work.

4427
03:07:40,980 --> 03:07:42,440
The next day was awful.

4428
03:07:42,440 --> 03:07:44,780
Today was not a very good day for me.

4429
03:07:44,980 --> 03:07:45,920
I.e.

4430
03:07:45,940 --> 03:07:48,200
today was not a very good day for me.

4431
03:07:48,740 --> 03:07:50,220
When I woke up.

4432
03:07:52,420 --> 03:07:53,560
Let's just say that.

4433
03:07:53,860 --> 03:07:55,620
Let's just say that.

4434
03:07:55,680 --> 03:07:56,960
Those noodles were very...

4435
03:07:56,960 --> 03:07:58,580
It was very rough.

4436
03:08:02,580 --> 03:08:05,060
Do not eat spicy noodles.

4437
03:08:05,280 --> 03:08:09,740
Do not eat noodles that are way spicier than you are used to.

4438
03:08:10,800 --> 03:08:11,700
That's for sure.

4439
03:08:11,880 --> 03:08:13,580
I just need more training.

4440
03:08:14,840 --> 03:08:15,700
Don't do that.

4441
03:08:16,060 --> 03:08:16,760
Don't... don't...

4442
03:08:16,760 --> 03:08:19,400
You remember when I said do the opposite of everything I do?

4443
03:08:19,580 --> 03:08:21,840
Do the opposite of everything I do.

4444
03:08:23,380 --> 03:08:25,240
This is one of the many examples.

4445
03:08:26,120 --> 03:08:29,000
Or you should do the opposite of everything I do, chat.

4446
03:08:29,260 --> 03:08:31,120
This is one of the many examples.

4447
03:08:34,260 --> 03:08:35,660
Doki, you are amazing.

4448
03:08:35,800 --> 03:08:37,320
I found your... you...

4449
03:08:37,320 --> 03:08:39,380
I found your Gumi showed me...

4450
03:08:39,380 --> 03:08:39,700
Uf...

4451
03:08:39,740 --> 03:08:41,460
You make me happy.

4452
03:08:41,660 --> 03:08:44,060
I've only known you since October.

4453
03:08:44,180 --> 03:08:45,040
And because of...

4454
03:08:45,040 --> 03:08:47,880
And because for me you were always early in the morning.

4455
03:08:48,000 --> 03:08:48,920
I miss them a lot.

4456
03:08:49,140 --> 03:08:50,440
But I sit here not crying.

4457
03:08:50,540 --> 03:08:53,080
I'm enjoying the amazing thing about you.

4458
03:08:53,400 --> 03:08:55,760
I don't know how amazing it is.

4459
03:08:56,100 --> 03:08:57,160
Your... your...

4460
03:08:57,740 --> 03:09:00,120
Your contagious just hearing makes me happy.

4461
03:09:00,400 --> 03:09:02,740
I just have sense with a clip of you laughing.

4462
03:09:02,840 --> 03:09:04,080
I know they could have said...

4463
03:09:04,080 --> 03:09:05,200
They could have said no.

4464
03:09:05,420 --> 03:09:07,820
I hope what happens in your life is amazing.

4465
03:09:07,960 --> 03:09:08,980
But please don't catch you.

4466
03:09:08,980 --> 03:09:10,620
You remember us and you get sad.

4467
03:09:10,780 --> 03:09:11,400
Think of us.

4468
03:09:11,520 --> 03:09:12,780
They need to... us.

4469
03:09:12,880 --> 03:09:13,560
Call upon us.

4470
03:09:13,560 --> 03:09:15,120
The bark nights will always rise for you.

4471
03:09:15,140 --> 03:09:16,220
Yesterday, today, tomorrow.

4472
03:09:16,800 --> 03:09:17,860
50 years from now.

4473
03:09:18,420 --> 03:09:18,820
Um...

4474
03:09:18,820 --> 03:09:19,640
Or 200...

4475
03:09:19,640 --> 03:09:20,080
2000.

4476
03:09:20,400 --> 03:09:21,920
I know saying all of you only means...

4477
03:09:22,780 --> 03:09:25,180
So much from a random person over... on the internet.

4478
03:09:25,500 --> 03:09:26,420
But please...

4479
03:09:27,380 --> 03:09:29,140
From as much as this word from a tomato.

4480
03:09:29,320 --> 03:09:31,900
It's true, genuine, and will never waver.

4481
03:09:32,340 --> 03:09:33,100
Which I got.

4482
03:09:33,100 --> 03:09:33,800
I'm crying and sad.

4483
03:09:33,960 --> 03:09:34,960
I would love if you could stay.

4484
03:09:35,100 --> 03:09:35,720
I know you can.

4485
03:09:35,860 --> 03:09:37,600
I hope you don't disappear off the...

4486
03:09:38,020 --> 03:09:38,420
Internet.

4487
03:09:39,100 --> 03:09:39,620
Emochi.

4488
03:09:39,860 --> 03:09:40,380
Awww...

4489
03:09:40,380 --> 03:09:41,000
Emochi.

4490
03:09:45,540 --> 03:09:47,080
Thank you, Emochi.

4491
03:09:47,520 --> 03:09:48,040
I'm..

4492
03:09:48,040 --> 03:09:49,120
Happy that...

4493
03:09:49,120 --> 03:09:50,900
You've been enjoying these streams.

4494
03:09:51,320 --> 03:09:51,840
And...

4495
03:09:52,420 --> 03:09:52,800
Remember...

4496
03:09:53,340 --> 03:09:53,600
Remember...

4497
03:09:53,600 --> 03:09:54,740
You were here for the journey.

4498
03:09:55,080 --> 03:09:55,560
And...

4499
03:09:55,560 --> 03:09:57,360
You were here for me live.

4500
03:09:57,540 --> 03:09:59,340
And you get to hear the laugh live too!

4501
03:09:59,720 --> 03:10:00,300
Come on.

4502
03:10:00,340 --> 03:10:01,120
People will be like.

4503
03:10:01,320 --> 03:10:02,320
People will be like.

4504
03:10:02,560 --> 03:10:03,780
People will be like...

4505
03:10:03,780 --> 03:10:04,040
Oh!

4506
03:10:04,300 --> 03:10:05,520
Listen to this vibe.

4507
03:10:06,020 --> 03:10:07,080
Of her laughter?

4508
03:10:07,080 --> 03:10:08,420
That ain't the same.

4509
03:10:08,720 --> 03:10:11,240
But you had live laughter!

4510
03:10:15,060 --> 03:10:17,700
But I'm so happy you guys are there.

4511
03:10:18,000 --> 03:10:19,300
You guys are there for me.

4512
03:10:19,420 --> 03:10:20,700
For this journey.

4513
03:10:29,980 --> 03:10:31,680
Bark nights forever!

4514
03:10:32,640 --> 03:10:34,060
Bark nights forever.

4515
03:10:39,700 --> 03:10:41,240
Alright, just make sure that you're okay.

4516
03:10:42,480 --> 03:10:43,680
It's not health reasons.

4517
03:10:44,180 --> 03:10:46,620
It's just the... Do you want me to be in jail?

4518
03:10:48,920 --> 03:10:50,640
For robbing a bank, guys?

4519
03:10:51,180 --> 03:10:54,120
I'm pretty sure bank people are like...

4520
03:10:54,120 --> 03:10:56,780
You can't go... I mean, they are for the first time.

4521
03:10:56,820 --> 03:11:00,140
But when you rob them a second time, they're like, no, no, no!

4522
03:11:01,060 --> 03:11:01,800
No, no, no!

4523
03:11:02,200 --> 03:11:04,440
We're gonna fucking put you in jail!

4524
03:11:04,680 --> 03:11:06,920
And I'd rather be in Motel 6 than in jail.

4525
03:11:07,080 --> 03:11:09,060
Cause then I could order Uber Eats.

4526
03:11:09,120 --> 03:11:12,980
Well, then I... My bunnies can order Uber Eats.

4527
03:11:22,690 --> 03:11:25,190
I said most of my thoughts in another document.

4528
03:11:25,690 --> 03:11:29,970
But I couldn't pass up one more opportunity to say how much you mean to me.

4529
03:11:30,070 --> 03:11:31,670
And how happy I am for you.

4530
03:11:31,790 --> 03:11:33,190
I'm gonna miss all this so much.

4531
03:11:33,390 --> 03:11:36,350
Thanks again for modding me at another mod's expense that one time.

4532
03:11:36,470 --> 03:11:38,090
And letting me be a part of everything.

4533
03:11:38,090 --> 03:11:39,410
I love you so much.

4534
03:11:39,430 --> 03:11:42,570
I'll always support you and always be your number one sim and number one mod.

4535
03:11:42,670 --> 03:11:43,850
Love, CeeVee.

4536
03:11:44,770 --> 03:11:45,890
Oh my gosh.

4537
03:11:46,570 --> 03:11:47,490
CeeVee, thank you.

4538
03:11:47,510 --> 03:11:51,630
CeeVee was also one of the original mods and one of the original mods and one of the...

4539
03:11:52,150 --> 03:11:54,870
One of my first viewers when I streamed Overwatch.

4540
03:11:55,290 --> 03:11:56,310
And it's crazy.

4541
03:11:56,590 --> 03:11:58,250
He's been here for a long time.

4542
03:11:58,370 --> 03:11:59,910
He's been in this journey for a long time.

4543
03:12:01,590 --> 03:12:04,790
And it's crazy that he's been a sub to me for so long.

4544
03:12:06,690 --> 03:12:07,090
Too.

4545
03:12:07,090 --> 03:12:09,450
Like a tier 3 CeeVee.

4546
03:12:13,010 --> 03:12:18,190
And it really does mean a lot that you've been with us for such a long journey.

4547
03:12:18,370 --> 03:12:19,430
And for...

4548
03:12:20,730 --> 03:12:21,290
For...

4549
03:12:21,990 --> 03:12:23,130
For so many years.

4550
03:12:23,470 --> 03:12:24,790
For so many years.

4551
03:12:24,910 --> 03:12:26,170
And I always say...

4552
03:12:26,970 --> 03:12:31,070
I always say that I can never believe that.

4553
03:12:31,170 --> 03:12:36,950
Especially the people from months ago, like years ago that's been with me to this day.

4554
03:12:36,950 --> 03:12:37,910
To this day.

4555
03:12:37,990 --> 03:12:39,850
I recognize so many of you guys for over...

4556
03:12:39,850 --> 03:12:42,310
Over the years that you're new and old.

4557
03:12:42,590 --> 03:12:44,630
It's just crazy to think about every time.

4558
03:12:47,370 --> 03:12:48,150
Hello, hello.

4559
03:12:48,350 --> 03:12:51,330
Resident Mon and VR Chat Addict here.

4560
03:12:51,550 --> 03:12:53,310
As you probably have already seen.

4561
03:12:53,630 --> 03:12:56,990
Doki Maple Bird, I hereby thank you for all the amazing months of entertainment.

4562
03:12:57,250 --> 03:13:02,230
I'm so glad I was able to share the joy and laughter HeartContagious is for every stream.

4563
03:13:02,450 --> 03:13:05,990
Coming from the hair-bringer self-appointed leader of the Doki Squad.

4564
03:13:05,990 --> 03:13:07,870
And number one simp fan.

4565
03:13:08,190 --> 03:13:13,870
I assure you the money I spent on the gifted subs, merch, charity, and whatnot was never a waste.

4566
03:13:13,990 --> 03:13:23,350
As all of it pays for the last nine months of horrors, stream games, horror streams, puzzle games, the shooty, McFace, Apex streams, and just the chat streams with emo art in the background.

4567
03:13:24,170 --> 03:13:29,750
It has been some of the greatest content to ever grace my eyes and bring out laughter I never thought was possible.

4568
03:13:30,050 --> 03:13:34,970
And everything else you have also helped me by being my true self and be who I am.

4569
03:13:34,970 --> 03:13:37,490
Now push my career in the avenue you have paved.

4570
03:13:37,630 --> 03:13:39,350
Like a thief to my blood-heart.

4571
03:13:39,430 --> 03:13:41,310
You were just another Jane Doe.

4572
03:13:41,370 --> 03:13:43,870
You're the Doki that everybody should know.

4573
03:13:45,550 --> 03:13:47,150
Thank you Ruby!

4574
03:13:47,630 --> 03:13:49,730
And Arlo and Ruby!

4575
03:13:49,970 --> 03:13:53,270
Thank you for the five gifted subs each to the community!

4576
03:13:53,670 --> 03:13:59,150
Can we get some more barf nights real quick for Arlo and Ruby.

4577
03:13:59,510 --> 03:14:01,570
For Arlo and Ruby.

4578
03:14:01,790 --> 03:14:03,210
Thank you so much.

4579
03:14:03,410 --> 03:14:03,570
Thank you so much.

4580
03:14:03,570 --> 03:14:03,890
Thank you so much.

4581
03:14:03,890 --> 03:14:04,950
For the ten gifted subs.

4582
03:14:04,950 --> 03:14:06,550
Thank you for the subs and all.

4583
03:14:06,730 --> 03:14:07,650
Thank you everyone.

4584
03:14:09,610 --> 03:14:10,870
Oh gosh, Ruby.

4585
03:14:10,990 --> 03:14:12,390
Thank you so much, Ruby.

4586
03:14:13,650 --> 03:14:19,110
Especially when you like, sometimes you might be the only mod in chat too during my really fucked up hours.

4587
03:14:19,510 --> 03:14:20,950
And it really means a lot.

4588
03:14:21,070 --> 03:14:23,450
Yamashii, thank you for the five gifted too!

4589
03:14:24,130 --> 03:14:25,070
Alright, more Park Nights.

4590
03:14:25,190 --> 03:14:26,090
But as I was saying, thank you.

4591
03:14:26,090 --> 03:14:27,210
Can you guys do more Park Nights again?

4592
03:14:27,430 --> 03:14:28,070
In chat.

4593
03:14:28,270 --> 03:14:33,590
But I was saying, thank you for just sticking around in the chat and just helping out with the modding.

4594
03:14:33,590 --> 03:14:35,350
And moderating and stuff when everyone's asleep.

4595
03:14:35,650 --> 03:14:37,930
It really does mean a lot when you're like, busy at work.

4596
03:14:38,210 --> 03:14:39,630
It does mean a lot, Ruby.

4597
03:14:39,910 --> 03:14:42,010
Cause I know like, some of my hours are really fucked up.

4598
03:14:42,230 --> 03:14:44,090
So thank you again.

4599
03:14:44,370 --> 03:14:49,130
Thank you for all your time and all your energy spent on the stream.

4600
03:14:49,190 --> 03:14:51,710
And for how generous y'all are.

4601
03:14:51,870 --> 03:14:52,830
Thank you guys.

4602
03:14:53,290 --> 03:14:53,970
Thank you.

4603
03:14:54,350 --> 03:14:56,810
I really do appreciate it.

4604
03:15:03,270 --> 03:15:05,330
Okay, I'm gonna refresh one more time.

4605
03:15:05,630 --> 03:15:08,590
And then if that's it, I will...

4606
03:15:08,590 --> 03:15:08,590
Oh!

4607
03:15:08,710 --> 03:15:09,230
There's one more!

4608
03:15:11,170 --> 03:15:13,970
I'm so happy I met you in one of your art streams.

4609
03:15:14,150 --> 03:15:15,930
2020 was a harsh year for all of us.

4610
03:15:15,990 --> 03:15:17,890
And it was probably the worst year for me.

4611
03:15:17,970 --> 03:15:22,390
But after joining your stream for the first time, you really made my days a lot better.

4612
03:15:22,570 --> 03:15:25,890
I'm gonna miss that contagious laugh, your jokes, and just you in general.

4613
03:15:26,070 --> 03:15:27,250
You've been such a joy.

4614
03:15:27,490 --> 03:15:32,250
And every time I come in, even if I'm lurking, I always feel comforted in being in your streams.

4615
03:15:32,490 --> 03:15:34,290
Thank you for letting me be a Park Night.

4616
03:15:34,430 --> 03:15:35,610
And sharing so many fun moments.

4617
03:15:35,630 --> 03:15:37,450
And sharing so many fun, amazing memories with us.

4618
03:15:38,490 --> 03:15:39,290
Thank you.

4619
03:15:39,330 --> 03:15:40,370
Thank you, Ambrose.

4620
03:15:40,470 --> 03:15:41,150
It really does.

4621
03:15:41,250 --> 03:15:48,710
Like I said, I know I keep saying this a lot, but I'm just happy that I was able to make your days better.

4622
03:15:48,850 --> 03:15:50,930
Especially during the quarantine months.

4623
03:15:51,250 --> 03:15:53,610
Like, it's rough when you're not able to go outside sometimes.

4624
03:15:53,710 --> 03:15:56,670
So I'm happy that I was able to give you, like, smiles and entertainments.

4625
03:15:56,670 --> 03:15:59,070
Make you forget about the bad things out there in the world.

4626
03:15:59,310 --> 03:16:00,690
And it just means a lot.

4627
03:16:00,810 --> 03:16:01,410
It really does.

4628
03:16:01,710 --> 03:16:02,650
Thank you again.

4629
03:16:03,610 --> 03:16:04,590
Thank you, everyone.

4630
03:16:05,030 --> 03:16:05,550
It really does.

4631
03:16:05,650 --> 03:16:07,230
And Rancid, thank you for the 300 bits.

4632
03:16:07,290 --> 03:16:09,010
And for the Tier 1 community sub gift.

4633
03:16:09,090 --> 03:16:11,290
And Ocelot for the gift too.

4634
03:16:11,510 --> 03:16:12,430
Thank you, everyone.

4635
03:16:12,510 --> 03:16:13,610
More Park Nights in chat.

4636
03:16:13,770 --> 03:16:15,150
More Park Nights in chat, guys.

4637
03:16:15,450 --> 03:16:16,110
Thank you.

4638
03:16:16,110 --> 03:16:17,970
Thank you, everyone, for all the gifts.

4639
03:16:18,150 --> 03:16:20,010
Guys, it really does mean a lot.

4640
03:16:20,090 --> 03:16:20,610
Thank you.

4641
03:16:21,670 --> 03:16:22,710
It really does.

4642
03:16:22,950 --> 03:16:23,930
Thank you, everyone.

4643
03:16:24,310 --> 03:16:26,230
You guys made me tear up so many times.

4644
03:16:26,430 --> 03:16:27,050
Thank you.

4645
03:16:29,490 --> 03:16:30,570
Thank you, guys.

4646
03:16:30,850 --> 03:16:31,550
Thank you, all.

4647
03:16:31,550 --> 03:16:32,610
Thank you.

4648
03:16:34,250 --> 03:16:34,750
Alright.

4649
03:16:35,050 --> 03:16:42,510
Before the last thing, we have a little special thing from Roar.

4650
03:16:42,690 --> 03:16:47,050
So let me join the Discord real quick and see if I can do the thingy.

4651
03:16:47,190 --> 03:16:48,310
So just...

4652
03:16:52,810 --> 03:16:55,670
See if I can set it up properly for you all.

4653
03:16:55,830 --> 03:16:57,610
I don't know how to do it properly.

4654
03:16:58,330 --> 03:16:58,830
So...

4655
03:17:00,550 --> 03:17:02,930
I'm trying to figure this out, guys.

4656
03:17:03,690 --> 03:17:04,590
I'm dumb.

4657
03:17:04,790 --> 03:17:08,010
I don't know if you guys remember that part about me.

4658
03:17:12,710 --> 03:17:13,190
Alright.

4659
03:17:13,790 --> 03:17:16,130
Yes, my Twitter handle will be the same.

4660
03:17:16,330 --> 03:17:17,470
It will be the same, guys.

4661
03:17:17,530 --> 03:17:18,090
Do not worry.

4662
03:17:18,790 --> 03:17:20,810
Let me see if I can do this.

4663
03:17:27,990 --> 03:17:28,890
Let's see.

4664
03:17:28,990 --> 03:17:29,870
I don't think I...

4665
03:17:29,870 --> 03:17:30,270
Can I?

4666
03:17:30,770 --> 03:17:31,590
What's it called?

4667
03:17:33,030 --> 03:17:33,510
Oops.

4668
03:17:33,510 --> 03:17:33,850
What's next?

4669
03:17:35,330 --> 03:17:36,110
Wait, wait, wait.

4670
03:17:36,150 --> 03:17:36,330
Okay.

4671
03:17:36,390 --> 03:17:37,470
I need to try to figure out which...

4672
03:17:37,470 --> 03:17:39,610
Guys, I'm trying to figure this out, guys.

4673
03:17:40,030 --> 03:17:40,690
There we go.

4674
03:17:40,850 --> 03:17:41,430
We're in.

4675
03:17:41,770 --> 03:17:42,530
Alright, Roar.

4676
03:17:42,830 --> 03:17:43,670
Let's do it.

4677
03:17:43,690 --> 03:17:44,110
Let's go.

4678
03:17:44,330 --> 03:17:44,870
We're in.

4679
03:17:47,550 --> 03:17:47,950
Oh.

4680
03:17:50,930 --> 03:17:51,690
Wait, wait, wait.

4681
03:17:51,930 --> 03:17:52,270
Wait.

4682
03:17:52,530 --> 03:17:52,930
Before...

4683
03:17:52,930 --> 03:17:53,330
Wait, wait, wait.

4684
03:17:53,390 --> 03:17:53,890
Don't do it.

4685
03:17:53,910 --> 03:17:54,030
Don't.

4686
03:17:54,050 --> 03:17:54,570
I just realized.

4687
03:17:54,690 --> 03:17:55,310
I fucked up.

4688
03:17:57,050 --> 03:17:58,370
We are not in.

4689
03:17:59,630 --> 03:18:00,330
We are...

4690
03:18:00,330 --> 03:18:01,310
I fucked up.

4691
03:18:01,690 --> 03:18:02,250
This is...

4692
03:18:02,250 --> 03:18:03,490
Look how tiny this box is.

4693
03:18:06,270 --> 03:18:06,790
Okay.

4694
03:18:06,890 --> 03:18:11,010
This is pretty scuffed, but I'm figuring this out as we go along, guys.

4695
03:18:11,730 --> 03:18:12,810
As we go along.

4696
03:18:13,330 --> 03:18:14,210
Is this it?

4697
03:18:14,650 --> 03:18:15,310
We're in.

4698
03:18:15,930 --> 03:18:17,450
Ninja with the 45!

4699
03:18:20,450 --> 03:18:21,910
Thank you, Ninja.

4700
03:18:22,470 --> 03:18:23,190
Can we get some...

4701
03:18:23,190 --> 03:18:25,070
Before we play this video, can we get some...

4702
03:18:25,070 --> 03:18:29,390
Barth Knights real quick to Ninja.

4703
03:18:30,050 --> 03:18:31,050
Thank you.

4704
03:18:31,050 --> 03:18:31,790
Thank you.

4705
03:18:32,230 --> 03:18:33,470
I really do love you.

4706
03:18:33,470 --> 03:18:34,490
I really appreciate it.

4707
03:18:34,490 --> 03:18:35,410
Thank you, Ninja.

4708
03:18:35,790 --> 03:18:36,730
For the 45.

4709
03:18:37,590 --> 03:18:38,790
Give the songs.

4710
03:18:39,630 --> 03:18:40,550
Thank you.

4711
03:18:43,030 --> 03:18:44,850
Thank you so much.

4712
03:18:45,010 --> 03:18:45,710
Oh my gosh.

4713
03:18:45,750 --> 03:18:46,910
It is lagging roar.

4714
03:18:47,210 --> 03:18:48,570
You might have a little problem.

4715
03:18:48,850 --> 03:18:50,130
I see your mouth.

4716
03:18:52,790 --> 03:18:55,350
It's a very long video, just so you know.

4717
03:18:55,590 --> 03:18:56,850
How long is it?

4718
03:18:57,010 --> 03:18:57,330
Oh, wait.

4719
03:18:57,590 --> 03:18:58,610
How long is it?

4720
03:19:01,590 --> 03:19:02,390
Is it...

4721
03:19:02,390 --> 03:19:03,450
How long is it?

4722
03:19:04,290 --> 03:19:05,690
Oh, you mean the video itself?

4723
03:19:05,710 --> 03:19:07,010
I don't know how to fix shit.

4724
03:19:07,410 --> 03:19:09,490
Oh, shit.

4725
03:19:10,350 --> 03:19:10,730
Okay, wait.

4726
03:19:10,790 --> 03:19:11,230
Is it fixed?

4727
03:19:11,410 --> 03:19:11,650
All right.

4728
03:19:11,730 --> 03:19:11,910
All right.

4729
03:19:11,990 --> 03:19:12,130
All right.

4730
03:19:12,510 --> 03:19:13,370
Over and out.

4731
03:19:13,450 --> 03:19:14,270
It's an hour!

4732
03:19:16,030 --> 03:19:18,130
I can't stream this for an hour.

4733
03:19:18,390 --> 03:19:19,170
I'm sorry.

4734
03:19:24,130 --> 03:19:28,230
Is there a way to stream like a quickie of it?

4735
03:19:29,950 --> 03:19:32,170
I will watch it after if I can.

4736
03:19:32,550 --> 03:19:33,310
Oh, shit.

4737
03:19:33,310 --> 03:19:33,430
Oh, shit.

4738
03:19:33,430 --> 03:19:34,730
I can't do an hour.

4739
03:19:34,810 --> 03:19:35,290
I'm sorry.

4740
03:19:35,610 --> 03:19:35,830
I'm...

4741
03:19:42,330 --> 03:19:45,050
Oh, or is there a way to do like...

4742
03:19:46,170 --> 03:19:47,050
A little...

4743
03:19:47,050 --> 03:19:48,630
Well, that's where I should have...

4744
03:19:48,630 --> 03:19:52,410
No, it's just that, I have like something else planned for you guys.

4745
03:19:52,530 --> 03:19:53,150
And I can't...

4746
03:19:53,150 --> 03:19:55,390
I don't wanna, I don't wanna like...

4747
03:19:56,730 --> 03:19:58,310
Delay this for way too long.

4748
03:19:58,410 --> 03:19:58,570
But...

4749
03:19:58,570 --> 03:20:01,070
I can upload the video to YouTube.

4750
03:20:02,070 --> 03:20:03,250
I can upload the video.

4751
03:20:03,250 --> 03:20:04,270
I'll upload a video to YouTube too.

4752
03:20:06,710 --> 03:20:09,270
Can we get one more daily song at the end?

4753
03:20:09,550 --> 03:20:10,030
Yeah!

4754
03:20:10,570 --> 03:20:11,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

4755
03:20:12,290 --> 03:20:14,310
I'll upload a video on YouTube and we...

4756
03:20:14,310 --> 03:20:15,050
I'll do a premiere!

4757
03:20:16,990 --> 03:20:19,150
And then we can all watch it together at the end of the stream.

4758
03:20:19,430 --> 03:20:19,970
How about that?

4759
03:20:21,670 --> 03:20:22,670
I'll do a premiere tomorrow!

4760
03:20:22,990 --> 03:20:26,270
We'll do a premiere of Rory's video on YouTube tomorrow.

4761
03:20:26,470 --> 03:20:28,630
And we can all watch it on stream.

4762
03:20:28,930 --> 03:20:30,430
Yeah, that'll be so much more fun!

4763
03:20:30,430 --> 03:20:31,910
I think that'll be much more fun.

4764
03:20:32,090 --> 03:20:33,050
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4765
03:20:33,290 --> 03:20:35,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's do that.

4766
03:20:35,470 --> 03:20:37,750
Is that okay with you, Rory?

4767
03:20:37,970 --> 03:20:40,290
So we'll all be there too.

4768
03:20:40,470 --> 03:20:42,630
Watching it live, all of us together.

4769
03:20:44,130 --> 03:20:46,330
Yeah, no, no, tomorrow on a YouTube premiere.

4770
03:20:46,670 --> 03:20:48,390
It'll be on my YouTube channel as a premiere.

4771
03:20:49,190 --> 03:20:50,070
Is that okay?

4772
03:20:50,650 --> 03:20:51,090
Rory?

4773
03:20:51,690 --> 03:20:53,630
Or would you prefer if we watch it now?

4774
03:20:53,890 --> 03:20:55,370
Would you prefer it today?

4775
03:20:57,290 --> 03:20:58,970
Well, you pick, because...

4776
03:21:00,430 --> 03:21:00,810
I'm gonna watch this video.

4777
03:21:04,110 --> 03:21:05,390
And it'll give you...

4778
03:21:05,390 --> 03:21:06,890
You can add more stuff.

4779
03:21:07,410 --> 03:21:08,950
I'll upload it for everyone to see.

4780
03:21:09,030 --> 03:21:10,430
Yeah, and everyone can see it too.

4781
03:21:11,230 --> 03:21:12,990
It won't just be me.

4782
03:21:20,160 --> 03:21:21,520
Yeah, so follow...

4783
03:21:21,520 --> 03:21:22,820
Oh my god, Rory, go to...

4784
03:21:22,820 --> 03:21:23,440
Rory!

4785
03:21:24,280 --> 03:21:26,080
I'm so sorry, Rory!

4786
03:21:27,780 --> 03:21:28,300
Rory!

4787
03:21:28,520 --> 03:21:30,800
Oh my god, I hope you're okay.

4788
03:21:31,160 --> 03:21:31,680
Rory!

4789
03:21:32,340 --> 03:21:33,320
Are you okay?

4790
03:21:35,620 --> 03:21:36,940
Okay, don't worry, don't worry.

4791
03:21:37,080 --> 03:21:38,100
We're almost at the stretch.

4792
03:21:38,220 --> 03:21:41,260
And then you can pass out, and then we'll have a YouTube premiere.

4793
03:21:42,260 --> 03:21:42,680
Um...

4794
03:21:43,640 --> 03:21:44,860
And we'll have a YouTube premiere.

4795
03:21:44,960 --> 03:21:46,240
We'll watch it together.

4796
03:21:46,400 --> 03:21:48,340
As the Bark Knights.

4797
03:21:48,500 --> 03:21:49,620
The final thing.

4798
03:21:50,620 --> 03:21:52,760
The final thing, as Bark Knights together.

4799
03:21:54,580 --> 03:21:55,720
Final thing, Rory.

4800
03:21:56,800 --> 03:21:57,820
You wanna sneak peek?

4801
03:21:57,940 --> 03:21:58,840
Oh, let's do a sneak peek!

4802
03:21:59,020 --> 03:21:59,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

4803
03:21:59,720 --> 03:22:00,480
Sneak peek, sneak peek!

4804
03:22:00,760 --> 03:22:01,740
Okay, okay, let me...

4805
03:22:01,740 --> 03:22:04,360
We'll do a sneak peek, and then the rest will be a YouTube premiere.

4806
03:22:04,660 --> 03:22:06,880
And then we'll have the rest as a YouTube premiere.

4807
03:22:07,420 --> 03:22:08,620
That's good, that's a good idea.

4808
03:22:09,140 --> 03:22:09,540
Yeah.

4809
03:22:10,420 --> 03:22:12,040
Okay, let me fix this real quick.

4810
03:22:12,180 --> 03:22:12,520
I need a...

4811
03:22:12,520 --> 03:22:14,480
Sorry guys, I just need to fix this.

4812
03:22:14,680 --> 03:22:17,300
I just need to reset, and then...

4813
03:22:17,300 --> 03:22:17,700
Oop.

4814
03:22:18,620 --> 03:22:19,020
Okay.

4815
03:22:20,360 --> 03:22:21,440
Alright, play it!

4816
03:22:21,580 --> 03:22:24,000
We'll get a sneak peek, and then...

4817
03:22:25,040 --> 03:22:25,440
Um...

4818
03:22:25,440 --> 03:22:26,500
You need a trailer?

4819
03:22:28,200 --> 03:22:29,520
Oh, just show the beginning.

4820
03:22:29,520 --> 03:22:31,180
We'll do a sneak teaser.

4821
03:22:31,420 --> 03:22:32,200
Five minute teaser.

4822
03:22:32,540 --> 03:22:33,980
Five to ten minute.

4823
03:22:34,240 --> 03:22:35,200
And then...

4824
03:22:37,340 --> 03:22:40,340
We'll all watch the rest tomorrow on the YouTube premiere.

4825
03:22:42,040 --> 03:22:43,020
Alright, let's go.

4826
03:22:43,420 --> 03:22:43,980
Alright,

4827
03:22:49,530 --> 03:22:49,530
let's go.

4828
03:22:49,530 --> 03:22:50,570
Thank you, Rory.

4829
03:22:50,930 --> 03:22:53,830
Thank you for spending so much time for all of us.

4830
03:22:54,050 --> 03:22:54,710
It really does.

4831
03:22:57,050 --> 03:22:58,210
It's a whole thing?

4832
03:23:01,790 --> 03:23:02,490
Thank you.

4833
03:23:02,530 --> 03:23:04,110
Thank you, we really do appreciate it, Rory.

4834
03:23:04,190 --> 03:23:06,790
Thank you for spending that much time for all of us.

4835
03:23:07,230 --> 03:23:08,910
It really does mean a lot.

4836
03:23:09,010 --> 03:23:09,210
Woah!

4837
03:23:10,170 --> 03:23:10,650
Woah!

4838
03:23:13,970 --> 03:23:14,930
A documentary!

4839
03:23:18,110 --> 03:23:19,930
April 16, 2021.

4840
03:23:20,650 --> 03:23:24,840
I'm picking the one song that I want to sing.

4841
03:23:25,060 --> 03:23:26,520
Guys, this was very hard.

4842
03:23:26,620 --> 03:23:28,180
Because I wanted it to be a good song.

4843
03:23:28,440 --> 03:23:29,340
That was...

4844
03:23:30,060 --> 03:23:32,940
What I wanted to share with you guys for the announcements.

4845
03:23:34,680 --> 03:23:37,320
So, it was very hard picking this song.

4846
03:23:37,460 --> 03:23:41,400
And I feel like I'm not going to do very well on this song.

4847
03:23:41,560 --> 03:23:43,460
Because there's like this very high note.

4848
03:23:43,620 --> 03:23:45,620
One for a specific line.

4849
03:23:45,880 --> 03:23:47,420
And I might just sing it lower.

4850
03:23:47,760 --> 03:23:48,140
That's me.

4851
03:23:48,240 --> 03:23:49,620
Who's the real one?

4852
03:23:49,740 --> 03:23:50,140
That's okay.

4853
03:23:57,670 --> 03:23:59,730
We'll have our last conversation.

4854
03:24:00,130 --> 03:24:02,930
And drink our last cup of coffee.

4855
03:24:03,230 --> 03:24:03,710
And drink our last cup of coffee.

4856
03:24:03,730 --> 03:24:05,090
Someday...

4857
03:24:05,690 --> 03:24:07,010
We might be 80.

4858
03:24:07,230 --> 03:24:07,770
Let's do it.

4859
03:24:08,030 --> 03:24:11,790
And think about the different things we used to say.

4860
03:24:11,910 --> 03:24:16,970
All the memories of you Will just become a ghost of a smile.

4861
03:24:17,550 --> 03:24:18,890
Caught in the wind.

4862
03:24:22,070 --> 03:24:22,790
Someday...

4863
03:24:22,790 --> 03:24:24,610
It'll be the last day.

4864
03:24:26,230 --> 03:24:30,370
It'll be the last day.

4865
03:24:30,910 --> 03:24:31,630
It'll be the last day.

4866
03:24:31,630 --> 03:24:32,810
This is the last day!

4867
03:24:33,110 --> 03:24:35,030
I'll be graduating on May 14.

4868
03:24:35,890 --> 03:24:36,610
I'll be graduating on May 14.

4869
03:24:38,150 --> 03:24:40,890
It must be a surprise for all of you.

4870
03:24:41,630 --> 03:24:42,230
It must be a surprise for all of you.

4871
03:25:05,060 --> 03:25:06,460
We're not crying!

4872
03:25:07,340 --> 03:25:08,160
We're not crying!

4873
03:25:09,060 --> 03:25:12,440
I honestly had no idea how I was going to transition.

4874
03:25:12,900 --> 03:25:12,920
I honestly had no idea how I was going to transition.

4875
03:25:12,960 --> 03:25:14,260
Today we celebrate.

4876
03:25:14,720 --> 03:25:15,940
It's final time.

4877
03:25:16,360 --> 03:25:19,040
The finale is about to be announced.

4878
03:25:19,160 --> 03:25:19,300
Relax.

4879
03:25:19,400 --> 03:25:20,000
Enjoy.

4880
03:25:20,460 --> 03:25:22,040
Let's go out with a bang.

4881
03:25:22,080 --> 03:25:22,800
Shall we?

4882
03:25:29,570 --> 03:25:31,710
It was but a simple rain.

4883
03:25:32,010 --> 03:25:32,770
It was but a simple rain.

4884
03:25:34,310 --> 03:25:36,710
It was a more innocent time.

4885
03:25:37,030 --> 03:25:39,710
Just got into watching P-Super's True Horror Live.

4886
03:25:40,030 --> 03:25:41,950
And was perusing the Twitch scene.

4887
03:25:42,330 --> 03:25:42,930
Then...

4888
03:25:42,930 --> 03:25:45,470
Somewhere there was what she made of you.

4889
03:25:45,910 --> 03:25:47,070
First I was in denial.

4890
03:25:47,890 --> 03:25:48,870
Her laugh was in denial.

4891
03:25:49,230 --> 03:25:51,950
Surely that must be her whole schtick.

4892
03:25:52,390 --> 03:25:54,290
But after a few moments...

4893
03:25:54,290 --> 03:25:56,450
The topic of Funko Pops arose.

4894
03:25:57,370 --> 03:26:01,350
My stone cold heart hadn't laughed so hard in so long.

4895
03:26:01,670 --> 03:26:02,670
I had forgotten.

4896
03:26:02,670 --> 03:26:02,770
I was so scared.

4897
03:26:02,790 --> 03:26:03,830
I had forgotten what it felt like.

4898
03:26:04,030 --> 03:26:05,290
I was still innocent.

4899
03:26:05,870 --> 03:26:07,110
I didn't realize.

4900
03:26:07,450 --> 03:26:09,990
This was just the beginning.

4901
03:26:10,450 --> 03:26:13,710
The more I watched, the more I became aware of the fact.

4902
03:26:13,970 --> 03:26:17,150
That I was indeed witnessing P-Consent.

4903
03:26:18,030 --> 03:26:19,230
P-Consent!

4904
03:26:19,850 --> 03:26:20,010
P-Consent!

4905
03:26:20,010 --> 03:26:20,530
P -Consent!

4906
03:26:21,490 --> 03:26:22,990
I've seen that with my eyes.

4907
03:26:23,010 --> 03:26:23,950
And just chatting.

4908
03:26:24,110 --> 03:26:28,210
And of course, Fun Apex times with Acid and Wabic.

4909
03:26:28,370 --> 03:26:31,470
And the personalities and skill of the shooty game.

4910
03:26:31,650 --> 03:26:32,770
Made for some great fun.

4911
03:26:32,790 --> 03:26:34,510
And the moments and hilarious times.

4912
03:26:34,930 --> 03:26:36,470
I needed here.

4913
03:26:36,690 --> 03:26:37,210
Placid!

4914
03:26:38,490 --> 03:26:40,530
I actually blocked you.

4915
03:26:42,890 --> 03:26:45,210
Okay, we know this is everyone's fault.

4916
03:26:45,430 --> 03:26:46,930
This is everyone's fault.

4917
03:26:47,150 --> 03:26:47,590
It's not my fault.

4918
03:26:47,770 --> 03:26:48,530
This is everyone's fault.

4919
03:26:48,530 --> 03:26:51,350
This is everyone's fault.

4920
03:26:52,190 --> 03:26:53,550
You get 70 damage.

4921
03:26:54,630 --> 03:26:56,730
What the fuck was I supposed to do?

4922
03:26:58,210 --> 03:26:58,730
Define.

4923
03:26:58,890 --> 03:26:59,410
Define.

4924
03:26:59,490 --> 03:27:00,910
That's what you were supposed to do.

4925
03:27:00,910 --> 03:27:03,510
I was like, okay, I'll just take your portal.

4926
03:27:04,450 --> 03:27:06,550
Wait, it's in the middle of the fucking open.

4927
03:27:06,990 --> 03:27:09,290
You already died two times before that.

4928
03:27:09,290 --> 03:27:10,390
It's always Acid's fault.

4929
03:27:10,550 --> 03:27:11,290
It's never my fault.

4930
03:27:13,390 --> 03:27:15,470
It's never the streamer's fault.

4931
03:27:15,770 --> 03:27:16,750
I'm streaming.

4932
03:27:17,310 --> 03:27:18,530
Kiss, kiss, kiss.

4933
03:27:19,410 --> 03:27:20,830
He was like, oopsie.

4934
03:27:21,030 --> 03:27:21,890
Alright, alright.

4935
03:27:21,970 --> 03:27:23,390
I'm waiting for you guys to...

4936
03:27:24,970 --> 03:27:30,010
You know like, Acid and Wabic arguing just sound like an old married couple.

4937
03:27:30,470 --> 03:27:31,830
When they argue.

4938
03:27:32,350 --> 03:27:33,870
It's a cousin's fault.

4939
03:27:34,450 --> 03:27:35,230
I'm joining streams.

4940
03:27:35,450 --> 03:27:37,170
Put a big ol' grin on my face.

4941
03:27:37,590 --> 03:27:39,430
I started to notice a flaw.

4942
03:27:40,110 --> 03:27:41,930
A chink in the content armor.

4943
03:27:42,290 --> 03:27:44,130
A chink in the content armor?

4944
03:27:44,150 --> 03:27:45,770
You're a terrible freak.

4945
03:27:46,550 --> 03:27:49,190
I've taken you to someone's home.

4946
03:27:49,270 --> 03:27:51,190
You've always seemed absurd to me.

4947
03:27:51,330 --> 03:27:53,550
Since I know you give more than you grow.

4948
03:27:54,050 --> 03:27:57,350
The thought of you worshiping money over anything else.

4949
03:27:57,470 --> 03:27:59,050
The thought of you worshiping money over anything else.

4950
03:27:59,050 --> 03:27:59,250
The thought of you worshiping money over anything else.

4951
03:27:59,250 --> 03:28:00,190
How dare you!

4952
03:28:00,750 --> 03:28:02,050
You can't even ask back into the community.

4953
03:28:02,670 --> 03:28:03,990
The thought of you...

4954
03:28:04,450 --> 03:28:05,010
No!

4955
03:28:06,090 --> 03:28:07,490
I've been exposed!

4956
03:28:08,650 --> 03:28:11,490
It's not only just Uber Eats.

4957
03:28:12,470 --> 03:28:13,710
I feel attacked.

4958
03:28:14,010 --> 03:28:17,810
The smile on your face and the laugh so bright it would momentarily...

4959
03:28:18,970 --> 03:28:20,670
The smile on your face and the laugh so bright it would momentarily...

4960
03:28:20,670 --> 03:28:21,730
Look at the mouse traveling.

4961
03:28:22,170 --> 03:28:22,250
...

4962
03:28:24,810 --> 03:28:27,130
I hope that in some form...

4963
03:28:27,130 --> 03:28:27,970
Give me a second.

4964
03:28:28,090 --> 03:28:28,570
Oh no!

4965
03:28:31,010 --> 03:28:31,850
Oh no!

4966
03:28:31,850 --> 03:28:33,410
More nights for Kurama...

4967
03:28:33,410 --> 03:28:34,450
Kurama Roy!

4968
03:28:34,970 --> 03:28:36,330
Thank you, Roy, though.

4969
03:28:36,590 --> 03:28:38,070
It's really...

4970
03:28:38,070 --> 03:28:39,210
Is that the...

4971
03:28:39,210 --> 03:28:41,030
We wanna end this with a sneak peek?

4972
03:28:44,510 --> 03:28:45,550
We might...

4973
03:28:45,550 --> 03:28:46,470
We might...

4974
03:28:46,470 --> 03:28:48,170
This might be the sneak peek!

4975
03:28:51,250 --> 03:28:53,870
That was a really good teaser, though.

4976
03:28:54,210 --> 03:28:54,730
Roy.

4977
03:28:54,990 --> 03:28:55,530
That was...

4978
03:28:55,530 --> 03:28:56,550
This is so good!

4979
03:28:57,370 --> 03:28:58,090
Oh, we keep...

4980
03:28:58,090 --> 03:28:58,830
Let's go.

4981
03:28:58,870 --> 03:28:59,330
Let's keep going.

4982
03:28:59,630 --> 03:29:00,250
Oh, wait.

4983
03:29:00,490 --> 03:29:01,330
Are we going... Keep going?

4984
03:29:01,490 --> 03:29:01,930
First...

4985
03:29:03,410 --> 03:29:06,470
This is so good.

4986
03:29:07,830 --> 03:29:08,570
...

4987
03:29:08,570 --> 03:29:08,990
...

4988
03:29:11,790 --> 03:29:12,870
...

4989
03:29:12,870 --> 03:29:12,950
...

4990
03:29:12,950 --> 03:29:12,970
...

4991
03:29:12,970 --> 03:29:13,010
...

4992
03:29:13,010 --> 03:29:13,550
...

4993
03:29:19,510 --> 03:29:20,590
...

4994
03:29:23,750 --> 03:29:24,830
...

4995
03:29:24,830 --> 03:29:25,110
...

4996
03:30:04,150 --> 03:30:05,650
I'll do a premiere of the video.

4997
03:30:05,650 --> 03:30:06,970
And just join the YouTube.

4998
03:30:08,410 --> 03:30:11,550
Just subscribe to the YouTube channel.

4999
03:30:11,710 --> 03:30:14,430
And I'll make a little premiere for the video for tomorrow.

5000
03:30:14,950 --> 03:30:15,770
And then...

5001
03:30:15,770 --> 03:30:17,030
That was beautiful.

5002
03:30:17,450 --> 03:30:18,490
That was really beautiful.

5003
03:30:18,610 --> 03:30:20,010
Thank you for all your time.

5004
03:30:20,170 --> 03:30:24,790
Even though it was a sneak peak, I can tell how much work...

5005
03:30:26,030 --> 03:30:29,390
Roy, you should put your own message there before you give me the video.

5006
03:30:29,650 --> 03:30:31,550
Put your own message there.

5007
03:30:31,550 --> 03:30:33,110
You really deserve it.

5008
03:30:33,210 --> 03:30:37,870
Really, in the deep of my heart, thank you for making that video, Roy.

5009
03:30:37,950 --> 03:30:39,110
It really is beautiful.

5010
03:30:39,390 --> 03:30:42,910
That little sneak peak you showed us was truly beautiful.

5011
03:30:43,350 --> 03:30:45,710
And I'm gonna upload a... I'm gonna make a little...

5012
03:30:47,610 --> 03:30:52,810
I'm gonna make a little schedule for a premiere of it tomorrow.

5013
03:30:53,110 --> 03:30:57,370
And then the person I appoint for the Discord owner...

5014
03:30:57,370 --> 03:31:00,430
will make a notification for you of what time it will be.

5015
03:31:00,590 --> 03:31:01,450
So, END!

5016
03:31:01,550 --> 03:31:03,990
Thank you for gifting 29 subs to the community!

5017
03:31:04,650 --> 03:31:05,350
Thank you!

5018
03:31:05,390 --> 03:31:07,430
Can we get some bright nights real quick for Ed?

5019
03:31:07,810 --> 03:31:09,330
Thank you, thank you, thank you everyone.

5020
03:31:09,730 --> 03:31:11,930
Again, like I said, it really does mean a lot.

5021
03:31:12,010 --> 03:31:13,750
All the love and support you've shown me.

5022
03:31:13,870 --> 03:31:15,650
And we're finally on the final stretch.

5023
03:31:15,870 --> 03:31:17,890
We're finally at the final stretch of the stream.

5024
03:31:18,210 --> 03:31:24,370
And I'm gonna do a little V-Rite back for a bit to set up for the final thing that I wanna do for you guys.

5025
03:31:24,750 --> 03:31:25,710
And then...

5026
03:31:26,830 --> 03:31:27,710
And then...

5027
03:31:27,710 --> 03:31:28,890
And then we'll see you from here.

5028
03:31:31,550 --> 03:31:32,630
Thank you again everyone.

5029
03:31:32,650 --> 03:31:36,170
Can we get some bright nights for Ed for the 25 gifted subs?

5030
03:31:36,330 --> 03:31:37,050
Thank you again.

5031
03:31:37,290 --> 03:31:39,130
Alright guys, I'm gonna be right back.

5032
03:31:39,430 --> 03:31:39,990
And...

5033
03:31:40,570 --> 03:31:41,130
Um...

5034
03:31:41,130 --> 03:31:41,910
And then...

5035
03:31:41,910 --> 03:31:42,130
Yeah!

5036
03:31:42,350 --> 03:31:42,930
I'll be back!

5037
03:34:48,940 --> 03:34:50,100
Oh my gosh.

5038
03:34:50,300 --> 03:34:51,260
We're finally here.

5039
03:34:51,420 --> 03:34:52,420
The last stretch.

5040
03:34:53,340 --> 03:34:54,440
I just wanna...

5041
03:34:54,440 --> 03:34:56,880
I guess my final message is to all of you.

5042
03:34:57,160 --> 03:34:57,720
Like...

5043
03:34:57,720 --> 03:34:58,920
I honestly...

5044
03:34:58,920 --> 03:34:59,960
I...

5045
03:34:59,960 --> 03:35:02,820
Like I said...

5046
03:35:02,820 --> 03:35:04,160
I never thought I would...

5047
03:35:04,160 --> 03:35:06,540
Build a community like this ever.

5048
03:35:06,740 --> 03:35:07,140
I...

5049
03:35:07,140 --> 03:35:09,400
I never thought that so many of you...

5050
03:35:09,400 --> 03:35:12,880
I didn't even think that so many of you would come to the final stream.

5051
03:35:13,060 --> 03:35:13,880
It really...

5052
03:35:13,880 --> 03:35:15,080
I'll be like...

5053
03:35:15,080 --> 03:35:19,660
I hope I have at least a hundred of you guys show up for the final stream.

5054
03:35:19,860 --> 03:35:20,980
Cause I want you guys all to be here.

5055
03:35:21,260 --> 03:35:22,720
To like watch this live.

5056
03:35:23,100 --> 03:35:24,380
And like...

5057
03:35:25,680 --> 03:35:26,960
And just be here.

5058
03:35:27,100 --> 03:35:29,260
And just experience the last stream.

5059
03:35:29,300 --> 03:35:31,140
The last moments we have together.

5060
03:35:32,200 --> 03:35:32,680
And...

5061
03:35:32,680 --> 03:35:34,140
And it really means a lot.

5062
03:35:34,140 --> 03:35:35,580
Thank you all of you guys for...

5063
03:35:35,850 --> 03:35:36,540
For come...

5064
03:35:36,540 --> 03:35:37,860
For sticking around.

5065
03:35:38,600 --> 03:35:39,260
And...

5066
03:35:39,260 --> 03:35:40,040
And just...

5067
03:35:40,040 --> 03:35:41,080
Hang out with me.

5068
03:35:41,180 --> 03:35:41,740
And...

5069
03:35:41,740 --> 03:35:42,160
Whoa!

5070
03:35:42,420 --> 03:35:43,080
Whoa!

5071
03:35:43,740 --> 03:35:44,440
What's that?

5072
03:35:45,880 --> 03:35:46,900
What's going on?

5073
03:35:47,980 --> 03:35:48,640
What?

5074
03:35:49,560 --> 03:35:50,440
Oh no!

5075
03:35:51,040 --> 03:35:51,980
Oh no!

5076
03:35:54,320 --> 03:35:55,480
Oh they're here!

5077
03:35:56,800 --> 03:35:57,460
Oh!

5078
03:35:59,880 --> 03:36:01,360

5079
03:36:02,660 --> 03:36:03,320
Oh!

5080
03:36:03,980 --> 03:36:04,120
Oh!

5081
03:36:04,720 --> 03:36:05,120
They are still here!

5082
03:36:05,120 --> 03:36:05,320
Oh shit!

5083
03:36:05,740 --> 03:36:06,900
We made it too long!

5084
03:36:07,280 --> 03:36:08,240
We made it too...

5085
03:36:08,240 --> 03:36:08,440
Okay.

5086
03:36:08,680 --> 03:36:09,360
Okay guys.

5087
03:36:09,480 --> 03:36:09,720
We...

5088
03:36:09,720 --> 03:36:10,840
Okay we might have...

5089
03:36:10,840 --> 03:36:11,820
We might have...

5090
03:36:11,820 --> 03:36:12,740
Don't ever catch me!

5091
03:36:13,020 --> 03:36:13,960
Okay we might have.

5092
03:36:14,120 --> 03:36:15,340
We might have fucking...

5093
03:36:15,340 --> 03:36:16,800
Drag this stream on too long.

5094
03:36:16,960 --> 03:36:17,240
Okay.

5095
03:36:17,380 --> 03:36:17,900
Okay guys.

5096
03:36:18,000 --> 03:36:18,480
I need to...

5097
03:36:18,480 --> 03:36:19,640
Okay I need to...

5098
03:36:19,640 --> 03:36:20,340
Give me a sec guys.

5099
03:36:20,440 --> 03:36:20,880
I need to...

5100
03:36:20,880 --> 03:36:22,280
I need to change real quick everyone.

5101
03:36:22,640 --> 03:36:23,400
I need to...

5102
03:36:23,400 --> 03:36:24,560
I need to take off my...

5103
03:36:24,560 --> 03:36:25,100
Skinsuit!

5104
03:36:25,140 --> 03:36:26,460
They can't catch me if I'm a tomato!

5105
03:36:26,460 --> 03:36:26,760
Tomato!

5106
03:36:26,880 --> 03:36:28,020
You can't catch me!

5107
03:36:29,100 --> 03:36:30,320
I'm a tomato everyone!

5108
03:36:30,720 --> 03:36:31,480
Do not worry!

5109
03:36:31,840 --> 03:36:32,600
Do not worry!

5110
03:36:32,700 --> 03:36:34,080
I'm taking off the skin suit!

5111
03:36:35,020 --> 03:36:35,920
There you go!

5112
03:36:36,060 --> 03:36:36,460
It's okay!

5113
03:36:37,260 --> 03:36:37,780
We're fine!

5114
03:36:37,860 --> 03:36:38,060
We're fine!

5115
03:36:38,120 --> 03:36:38,320
We're tomato!

5116
03:36:38,640 --> 03:36:39,500
They don't know who I am!

5117
03:36:39,640 --> 03:36:40,260
We're tomato!

5118
03:36:40,640 --> 03:36:41,460
You don't know who I am!

5119
03:36:41,740 --> 03:36:42,360
Oh gosh!

5120
03:36:42,660 --> 03:36:43,680
Okay, okay, okay chat.

5121
03:36:43,760 --> 03:36:47,180
Remember when I said I had to take a day off to teach the bunnies how to drive?

5122
03:36:47,420 --> 03:36:48,900
Yeah, this is what the lessons are for!

5123
03:36:50,640 --> 03:36:51,500
Bow-Bow!

5124
03:36:51,560 --> 03:36:52,220
May-May!

5125
03:36:52,400 --> 03:36:53,220
Get the car running!

5126
03:36:53,520 --> 03:36:54,800
We're going on the run now!

5127
03:36:55,160 --> 03:36:57,680
I can't believe I had to dispose of that skin suit!

5128
03:36:57,960 --> 03:36:59,440
I have to make a new identity!

5129
03:37:00,340 --> 03:37:02,000
Maybe... maybe a new hairstyle.

5130
03:37:02,940 --> 03:37:05,360
What clip on hair should I choose next guys?

5131
03:37:05,540 --> 03:37:07,740
Do you think I can pull a non-blonde look?

5132
03:37:08,400 --> 03:37:09,200
I don't know.

5133
03:37:09,620 --> 03:37:12,300
But I can't let the cops find me that easily though.

5134
03:37:12,380 --> 03:37:15,760
So I gotta dig around my tree of fast-for-treats so they can do.

5135
03:37:16,160 --> 03:37:17,900
Gosh, it's so much work to do.

5136
03:37:17,960 --> 03:37:18,300
Bye!

5137
03:37:19,540 --> 03:37:21,420
You think you see me on the streets?

5138
03:37:21,520 --> 03:37:22,680
No snitching, alright?

5139
03:37:22,940 --> 03:37:24,200
We're in this together now!

5140
03:37:24,360 --> 03:37:25,100
Park nights forever!

5141
03:37:25,700 --> 03:37:30,020
But before I go on my park nights, here's your little secret.

5142
03:37:30,660 --> 03:37:33,320
I robbed that bank again for a reason!

5143
03:37:34,120 --> 03:37:38,440
This special gift for all you after I go wasn't cheap.

5144
03:37:39,160 --> 03:37:41,160
But it was worth it.

5145
03:37:41,320 --> 03:37:44,340
Now here's one last kiss for all of you.

5146
03:37:44,680 --> 03:37:46,020
Here's one last kiss.

5147
03:37:49,540 --> 03:37:50,740
One last...

5148
03:37:50,740 --> 03:37:51,800
Wha!

5149
03:37:51,900 --> 03:37:52,280
Wait!

5150
03:37:52,360 --> 03:37:52,820
W-what?

5151
03:37:52,940 --> 03:37:54,260
I 썸 Jessica

5152
03:38:13,480 --> 03:38:18,980
I 썸 Jessica I 썸 Jessica

5153
03:41:06,870 --> 03:41:09,250
Meet again, my dear bark knights.
