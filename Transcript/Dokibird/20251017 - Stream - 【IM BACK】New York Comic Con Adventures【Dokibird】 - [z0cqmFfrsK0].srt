6
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,760

15
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,220
I didn't finish cleaning it.

16
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:12,880
But I, okay, so speaking of cleaning my room, um, I left like one.

17
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:24,840
I, I, okay, so before I left, um, I might have accidentally left like, um, like two plates of, like two bowls from my pre-cooked meals.

18
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,040
And I didn't realize the lid wasn't closed.

19
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,360
Um, because like I didn't finish it.

20
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:55,540
So, and then when I came back, I was, like putting all the dishes like i was putting the pre-cooked bowls um because they gave us like glass containers so i had to clean it and everything and then um i was putting them in the dishwasher because i was like oh shit okay i need to clean this um like i came back and then and then i and then i like looked at the bowl and it was just mold it was just all mold i was like like i jumped scared myself

21
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:07,620
i was like oh no it's last of us it's it's really a bowl of I had to like jump scared me.

22
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:29,260
I was not expecting it I was just like, oh shit Yeah, I'm infected No, I have to clean it because it's glass bowl and like I have to clean it because like it's not mine.

23
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,160
It's from the chef.

24
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:31,780
So So I

25
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:46,480
Yeah, so I didn't put that specific bowl yet into the dishwasher because it's literally a bowl of mold.

26
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:51,020
So I have, I think I have to like scrape it out.

27
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,100
Do I scrape it out before I put it?

28
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,260
It's a lot.

29
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,900
It was, I, it scared me.

30
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,880
Yeah, I have to scrape it out and then put in the dishwasher.

31
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:02,920
Yeah.

32
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,720

33
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,100

00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:23,810
I opened the windows when I, like, this morning.

39
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,250

41
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,850
Why are you like this?

42
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,110
It's okay.

43
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:34,350
Not good, but okay.

Okay.

48
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:38,530
They don't know.

49
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:39,510
Guys, they don't.

50
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:42,110
They don't know.

51
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:45,390
They don't have to know, guys.

52
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:48,790
They don't have to know, chat.

53
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:54,270
Okay, but how long is long-term?

54
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:55,470
That's the thing.

55
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,430
How long is long-term?

56
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,230
Because I...

57
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,770
Anyway, hello, everyone.

58
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:08,530
Hello, everyone.

59
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:09,990
Doobie from DoobieStream.

60
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:13,290
I was watching a little bit of Doobie doing her little karaoke.

61
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:18,530
I got a little sneak peek of her 2D when we were both in New York City.

62
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:23,930
But yes, for those who don't know, I was gone for...

63
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:26,430
My business trip was basically me going to...

64
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:29,650
Me and Doobie going to New York City for Comic-Con.

65
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:39,810
Because Capcom invited me to check out their newest games, the newest Resident Evil, and also Onimusha.

66
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,790
Or Onimushu?

67
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:41,970
Oh my gosh, I keep...

68
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,290
I don't know which one.

69
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,190
I keep saying... Onimusha.

70
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,450
I like to say Onimushu, but it's Onimusha.

71
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,730
I mean, they had other ones.

72
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:52,110
Do they have the Monster Hunter one?

73
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:58,070
Because we get to choose, like, which games we wanted to play test, I guess.

74
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:00,470
I think it was, like, we wanted to check out.

75
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,670
So, there was, like, the Monster Hunter...

76
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,110
The newest Monster Hunter game.

77
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,990
There was the Pragmata.

78
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:08,750
And then there was...

79
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:22,510
you know, obviously you wanted to try out Resident Evil, and for me, it would be Onimusha, so we went and checked those out, but yeah, huge shout out to Capcom for inviting me and for letting me bring, for letting me bring Duby along with me, because I was like,

80
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:26,270
um, because, you know, I was just like, oh, uh, can I get a plus one?

81
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,150
Yeah, bring a plus one.

82
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:31,250
They're like, yes, yeah, we can, because like, all the tickets were sold out, too, at that time.

83
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:35,370
Um, all the tickets were sold out, so I thought figured, like, you know, it would be a great experience.

84
00:09:35,570 --> 00:10:06,550
Duby and I were talking before, and stuff like that um and her aunt was also like a huge fan of musicals as well um and i was like you know what yeah you want to come to new york with me and then you know i had an extra i had an extra plus one ticket and then um but it was a great time um so yeah huge shout out to capcon uh 4d invitation that was basically my business trip um um i just stayed in new york a little longer because i was like you know i'm in new york city um great way to waste money i guess

85
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:41,410
been in new york city in a very long time the last time i was in new york city was i think like um nine years ago i think um so it's been um uh you know it was fun coming back after so long and i wanted to like you know experience like you know have a cool experience like um just going around new york city like the food and stuff like little italy um i went i did go to chinatown i did i I went to little Italy.

86
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,590
I didn't buy a lot of stuff.

87
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,930
Oh, I will say there was one.

88
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:51,010
I did spend a lot of money on one thing.

89
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:54,370
God, my God.

90
00:10:54,590 --> 00:11:05,030
I didn't spend a lot of money this trip because like when, for those who didn't know, I used to go to New York a lot, like nine years ago.

91
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:09,590
I went to, back then, I went there like, I think it was, I don't even know if it's not.

92
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:41,690
I don't know maybe eight years ago um but um back then you know when I'm you know go to Nintendo store I go to Rockefeller you know back then I spent a lot of money back then when I was in New York at that time um but like this time it was more about like the experience I spent a lot of money on the experience of New York City um so I went and saw lots of museums a lot of like activities to do food as well I didn't buy a lot of stuff because like even when I was in Nintendo World not even buy anything in the Nintendo store.

93
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:42,590
I almost did.

94
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,410
I almost bought something in the Nintendo store.

95
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,070
But then I was like, I don't really, I don't know.

96
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:50,590
I think like the older you get, the less material things you buy, other than my own merch.

97
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:56,470
Um, that's the only thing I, I think like, for me, I, I spent money on my own merch.

98
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,170
That's it.

99
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:01,210
On my own, not my, on my own stuff.

100
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:04,410
Like, and like at artist alley too.

101
00:12:04,690 --> 00:13:11,790
I would spend money on me, but I won't buy like, I haven't been buying other things like I didn't even buy stuff at Nintendo Store because I was just like do I really need it I don't really have space anymore because I just have space for my merch I was like thinking oh man do I really need it like do I don't even have space for this I only have space for like my own stuff like my for dokey merch not for like I was like there was a giant there was like a there was like a giant Pokemon plush um where it's like there's mochi plush of like pipelup and uh slowpoke and I was like oh it's so cute I was like I was debating for so long I looked at that shelf for so I'll show you guys what it looks like I looked at that shelf for so long like because I'm like do I buy it oh I was just like staring at it for like I think like 15 minutes like like debating in my head like do I buy it and bring it home oh man but I'm thinking I don't have room.

102
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:16,190
I just don't have room in my apartment.

103
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,530
That's the only thing holding me back.

104
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:22,330
I was like, I just don't have space for it.

105
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:29,070
Like 90% of the space in my room is just ducky merch.

106
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:31,630
That's it.

107
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:35,370

00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:51,050
Okay, anyway, so I didn't get the Minecraft one because there was something else that caught my eye.

00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,310
I don't even know their names.

155
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,390
I just don't understand.

156
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:53,650
I saw this.

157
00:17:53,830 --> 00:18:02,390
I was like, oh my God, if I'm going to have any Swarovski, I don't want to trade.

158
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:05,570
should be a minion.

159
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:14,710
So this was the, this was my, this is, this was my, your super chat went into.

160
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:25,390
And you don't understand, you don't understand, this is your brain on most sports.

161
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:28,290
That you have to stick with a super chat thing.

162
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,550
You don't understand, guys.

163
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:35,590
That's not Bob, It was so worth it.

164
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:38,050
This was my only expensive purchase.

165
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:40,630
I didn't buy anything else.

166
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:46,970
Okay, this was my one purchase that I made for myself.

167
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:51,690
At least I didn't buy a Funko Pop.

168
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,810
I bought this little guy right here.

169
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:54,610
Look at this.

170
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,410
I bought this little guy.

171
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,730
We'll crop the price out.

172
00:18:59,030 --> 00:18:59,930
I bought him.

173
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:01,690
This was my purchase.

174
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:18,190
So this little guy, it's gonna, it's gonna sit on my desk and every time I see it, this is what my money goes to.

175
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:20,710
Thank you for the super chat rules.

176
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,050
Thank you, thank you.

177
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:25,710

00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:26,950
Thank you, thank you.

179
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,470
This will surely appreciate and value.

180
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,010
So now I'm thinking of the super chat.

181
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:32,870
Thank you, thank you.

182
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:33,950
Yeah, we don't.

183
00:19:33,970 --> 00:20:03,990
understand we were right we don't understand oh thank you for the super chat thank you thank you like look at it it's because to my desk and every time i look at it i'll remember uh i remember how how good a time how good time of a time i had a comic-con no i bought this guy i bought this little guy um i just i can't help i need like okay i was thinking like if i was gonna this was If I was going to own any Swahski thing,

184
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:05,570
it had to be minions.

185
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:07,350
Like, it just had to be.

186
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:13,690
I was like, because, like, I was like, why does it, first off, why does it have a Swahski collaboration?

187
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:17,550
And then I was like, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, you know?

188
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:21,570
It could become a collector's item.

189
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:22,430
You don't know that.

190
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:28,490
In 50 years, this would be like a sought-after item because they don't redo collabs, guys.

191
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:29,190
They don't read.

192
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:31,030
It's a limited edition.

193
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,310
Bob Sooski.

194
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:35,270
Crystal.

195
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,190
Sooski Crystal.

196
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,370
Limited edition figure.

197
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:44,870
It's gonna, it can only go up.

198
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:45,950
You don't understand.

199
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:49,230
The value of it can only go up.

200
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:53,590
What if crystals are some, what if we suddenly lose all crystals?

201
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:55,510
Like there's no more crystals on earth.

202
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:16,110
no more crystals on earth so waski has mined all the crystals and then this is like one of the like one of the hundreds of crystals left in the world and yes but this isn't made in a lab this was mined in hard earth

203
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:42,510
yeah you'll just take your way to through to the other side of the world eventually sliding even the super chat thank you thank you the super chat thinking thank you you know you put it on stream a few times you call it right up not cpa could sell your tax professional just say that you was super chat and it was cheaper and it was cheaper than the minecraft collab

204
00:21:46,430 --> 00:22:09,810
i mean i think this was a worthwhile purchase i mean okay so if you guys don't follow me on twitter um it started very unlucky i mean there was some unlucky bits scattered throughout the trip but it started out very unlucky because i missed my flight

205
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:26,370
so um i missed my flight because i was three minutes late for baggage check-in um so i think That was a wake-up call.

206
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,870
That was a wake-up call for me.

207
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:29,390
I was like, I gotta get my shit together.

208
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:34,830
No, that was not what the tweet was about because it gets worse.

209
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:40,710
So, um, so that, that, when that happened, it was like a wake-up call.

210
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:42,930
And I was like, I really gotta get my shit together.

211
00:22:43,290 --> 00:23:18,490
I should not, I, I was literally three minutes late, um, from the cutoff for, like, I just needed to like put my baggage like put my baggage through check-in so i couldn't check in because like obviously like um they closed the check-in already like uh like i could go in i already checked in like myself i needed like my bag to be checked in so like my plan was like what if i just leave my bag leave my suitcase at the airport and then like and i just go in and then i buy close in New York City.

212
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:28,470
I was that desperate because like it was literally the last flight um to New York City um on that day.

213
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:43,670
So I was trying to do that and then like I went like I went to like the baggage check it like the the like um storage area and they're like you gotta fill out a form and then and then and then I looked at the form and there was so much to fill in.

214
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:44,830
I was like I'm not gonna make it.

215
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:50,150
I was like, I'm not gonna make it because I still have to go through security.

216
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:56,590
Um, so, so, um, so because of that, I was just like, fuck, okay, I guess.

217
00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:01,130
And then I looked, um, I, yeah, I was like, I'm not gonna make it.

218
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:06,730
There's no way I can fill up or I'm in time, and then go through security and then make it to the flight.

219
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:12,770
So, so like, I, I, I, I, I calculated And I was like, there's no way

220
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:20,650
So, I was like, why did I Got there too late?

221
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:43,910
I sort of like disassociated Because you know how I was like, I didn't sleep So, because I was like, I'm just gonna sleep on the plane You know, so I fucked up And I disassociated a little bit Too long So, um So, so that's why I was like, this was a wake-up call.

222
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,250
I gotta get my shit together.

223
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:51,190
So, um, so, like, because of that, I was like, oh, I looked at the time.

224
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:54,890
I was like, oh, fuck, I had to take, I had to take the Uber right now.

225
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:58,830
Yeah, so, that's why I missed the flight.

226
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,570
So, it was so bad.

227
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:04,450
Um, it was, it was so bad.

228
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:09,110
And, um, um, wait, I wrote everything down.

229
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:09,930
Give me a sec.

230
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:10,950
Let me, okay, so.

231
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:19,650
So, I had to stay at the airport for like six hours until like the sun came on.

232
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:23,770
That was, so I had to buy a new ticket.

233
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:25,930
Well, I didn't have to worry about the return trip.

234
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,630
It was just the going there ticket.

235
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:36,370
So, so I had to wait up in the airport for six, because I was not going to fucking go back home.

236
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:38,290
I was like, I'm here.

237
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:40,950
So I waited six hours.

238
00:25:42,890 --> 00:26:05,930
six hours at the airport until the fucking sun came out and then I flew over and then I flew over to New York City so yeah, no, Duby was there first because she was like, where are you and I was like, about that I may or may not, I missed my play I was like,

239
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:31,390
I might be like I might arrive like 10 hours later So, um, so, uh, during, this is where it gets even more fucked up, during the middle of the flight, to all you women out there, you know that feeling where you're like, oh no,

240
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,330
to all the women out there.

241
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:54,070
So, in the middle of flight, I felt something, and I was like, oh no, but I was too scared to check.

242
00:26:54,650 --> 00:27:03,870
I was just, I, because, okay, for those who are like, oh, why don't you track it, you know, like, you know, like all the other women do?

243
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:08,690
I can't because it's so, my period is so irregular.

244
00:27:10,970 --> 00:28:41,910
for a very long time so like i never it's like always a surprise because i never know so i i never know so so in the middle of it i was just like oh no because i i was like there's no way but it happened it happened the conch you came and it was like a little surprise like a little middle of the flight um and also um no i was i after i got off the flight you know after i got off the flight and i was in the airport i was like diamonds gotta buy some pads so yeah um so yeah anyway uh it's a little gotcha surprise uh anyway so i had to sit in between by the way i also had to sit because the flight was apparently like um super packed and everything i sat in between an old couple and they were like to me we're like they're like yeah we're together we bought this we we made we try to buy like the seats between the middle seat hoping that no one would sit in the middle i was like oops sorry like they told me that I was just like,

245
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:44,930
I was like, oh, sorry, the flight is down.

246
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:47,170
This was the only seat left.

247
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:52,250
Like, I had to sit there between an old married couple.

248
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:54,950
I was like, oh, jokes on you guys.

249
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:56,870
Guess I'm here.

250
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:02,190
I'm just like, why would you, why would you bet on that?

251
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:10,950
Like, I, first off, I'm like, why would you like bet on the fact that no one will, the possibility that no one?

252
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:19,150
One's gonna abide in the middle seat like I'm sorry there's freaks out there in the world that will sit in the middle But like that's I'm not one of them though.

253
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:37,490
I know I had to get it because it was the last seat It was literally the last seat left and it was funny What's funny is that there were actually seats beside us That was like empty because they didn't show up.

254
00:29:37,570 --> 00:30:11,770
I think they were like me where they missed the flight they they they didn't show up so the old lady before we took up was like oh hey um when we take up you can take that seat over there i was like yeah of course i can and then i fell asleep so i guess like i guess fucker again i'm so tired i had didn't sleep for like more than 20 for i was like don't worry i definitely will do that and then like before the plane took up i'm fucking passed out.

255
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:19,710
And then when I woke up, I woke up, I was like, it's too late.

256
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:20,210
I moved.

257
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:25,550
You know, when I woke up, I could feel it, you know, like the moon was shining.

258
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,010
And, and then I was like, I'm not getting up.

259
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:29,710
I'm sorry, ma'am.

260
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:31,510
I am not getting up.

261
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,990
I just stayed in my seat.

262
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:37,590
I was like, if I move, something will happen.

263
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:39,250
And I was not moving.

264
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:52,550
I, the moon calling for me um so so i was just like sorry i guess i'll be i guess i'm gonna stay in the middle

265
00:30:56,070 --> 00:31:11,330
um um uh patria said thank you for the super chat thank you thank you i don't know a lot about that story but i do know that woman of note tends to keep some spares in the back yeah you know i would have done that if i wasn't running on if if like i didn't have my shit together Like,

266
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:24,090
you know, I, you know, like, um, it didn't help that I spent, like, 20 minutes trying to find, like, trying to figure out which plushie I was going to bring to New York City, too.

267
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:26,230
So, that didn't help as well.

268
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:29,310
Uh, yeah, I was not prepared in general.

269
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:34,050
So, I even brought, I accidentally brought shorts.

270
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:38,970
Like, because I was like, I don't know how cold New York City is.

271
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:50,190
It was like, like half of my, I had to buy more pants in New York City because I was just like, it could be hot.

272
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:54,130
Like I was sitting there, it's like, it could be, it could be hot.

273
00:31:54,670 --> 00:32:01,270
And so I brought like half of the pants I brought were shorts or like to my knees.

274
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:08,210
And so I ran out of long pants during my, during my trip in New York.

275
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:10,010
Tokyo is like, I don't know.

276
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:10,950
I was like, how?

277
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:42,770
how bad I was like thinking like hmm global warming has been pretty fucked up I was like maybe it's not that cold and I was just like I was just like I was like hmm I don't know maybe global warming hit New York City hard check the temperature I was like so bro it's I told you this trip was a wake-up call for me.

278
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:44,890
I was like, I can't get my shit together.

279
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:51,610
So like, this trip was like the wake-up call for me to get my shit together, because I was a fucking mess.

280
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:55,010
I was a fucking mess.

281
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:56,710
Anyway.

282
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:08,810
So, also, I accidentally, when I was buying a ticket, the newer ticket, to fly to New York, I actually bought a ticket to New Jersey instead.

283
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:37,290
But thank God, thank God I have a membership card to air like an uh, like the aeroplane to air Canada so I can get a refund So at first the first flight I bought was to New Jersey and said because I was I because apparently New Jersey also has a because if you do like to New York it gives you this other airport That's located in New Jersey and not in JFK.

284
00:33:37,290 --> 00:34:01,130
Um, so I was so confused Yeah, I, I, for some reason, I don't understand, um, because I guess it's close to New York City, so they're like, it works, you know, like, so I don't know, I wrote, I wrote to New York, and they gave me the first, the one, the closest flight,

285
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:43,010
because it was the earliest flight, was to New Jersey, so, so, yeah, I, it took me to the EWR airport, and then I was looking at it I was like EWR I'm supposed to go to JFK maybe it's another airport in New York and then I looked at and then you know I bought the ticket because I was panicking you know I was like panicking and I was like not okay like my mind was not okay at that time it still isn't but you know it's a lot better um and I was like boom and then after I paid I was like wait a minute why does this say like why does this say New Jersey

286
00:34:46,370 --> 00:36:07,930
so I was like oh fuck I bought the wrong ticket thank god I have like I have a membership for Air Canada so like they fully refunded yeah I checked after I told you guys I wasn't okay I was not okay and I told you it was so bad it was so I make my own my own like apparently um rice thank you the super chat thank you thank you um it's because ewr is a much bigger international airport than either the ones in new york city so let's just use that as a nearby hub thank you the super chat thank you thank you so anyway i got that refunded and i bought the right one to new york city but anyway after i've arrived in the jfk airport um apparently like to my hotel it was supposed to be 30 minutes apparently um when i arrived the roads to the airport were blocked so because i was like we're all the taxis i was just so confused i was like where did all the taxis go like because i was there was a lie and then we were waiting i was like that's weird that that's that's like weird and i looked at

287
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:11,130
google maps I was like, what's going on?

288
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:20,650
And then there's been, apparently they closed down an important road that leads to the airport.

289
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:23,910
And it was closed for like two hours at that point.

290
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:26,150
So I was just like, oh my God.

291
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:38,010
Like, if I arrived at my actual time, I would not have had to go through this because they actually closed it two hours ago.

292
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:42,430
Let's just keep getting worse.

293
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:47,810
So, basically, I was in a line for a taxi.

294
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:51,630
But it wasn't even a super long line, too.

295
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:54,810
But there was literally no cars coming in.

296
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:59,570
So, I was in that line for, like, 20 to 30 minutes.

297
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:05,670
And then, I was in a taxi for an hour plus.

298
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:07,510
I like it.

299
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:18,050
I was just like, oh, because I was stuck in traffic for that fucking long because they closed the roads down.

300
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:23,890
Like, that is, that's, bro, you're this close to coming to Gotham City.

301
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:26,430
You would have loved to have you there.

302
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:28,810
Just so, guys, thank you for the super chat.

303
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:30,350
Thank you, thank you.

304
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:34,490
Yeah, so I think, you know what's crazy?

305
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:38,430
My flight actually arrived.

306
00:37:38,830 --> 00:38:11,550
hour early so I was like oh my god I get to be at the hotel like an hour early that was a lie that was it just it was there to compensate with me being stuck in traffic for an hour yeah it got evened out to an hour early too like jokes on me the roads closed so So it canceled each other out.

307
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:21,090
So yeah, so that's basically the start of like how unlucky I was.

308
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:29,010
By the way, I didn't start using the subway until like the second last day.

309
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:31,230
That's what I've been through.

310
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:38,810
So Google Maps have lied to me a lot of how long it takes me to go from one place to the other.

311
00:38:38,830 --> 00:39:55,230
um because i'd be like oh it's just a 30 minute taxi ride it was not like every time i like go to like every time i went somewhere i was like oh it's just a 30 minute taxi ride it was not a 30 minute taxi ride it does not count because i looked i was like okay so there is there is this one block of thing on google maps that's blocked that has traffic jam but it still account it says it says this should be i was stuck at most at twice i twice uh where i was stuck in the taxi i didn't uber because uber was so expensive compared to like the taxis i learned that because i tried it out like i was like okay i'll uber first and then i'll do a taxi next an uber for like one time it cost me a hundred fucking dollar canadian monopoly money though by the way it's not a hundred money um to go to like i guess like the inner city of new york because i my my hotel was in around chinatown and i wanted to go to like the inner city of new york city and then i tried like that is that is fucked up i was

312
00:39:55,230 --> 00:40:11,310
like that that's so fucked up so then i and then i took a and then i took a taxi um i took a taxi and it was like 20 so i was like i I was like, I'm not an Uber in here.

313
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:19,850
It was like 20 to 30 Monopoly money when I took a fucking taxi compared to an Uber.

314
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:28,950
Anyway, so the reason why but yeah, I wasn't one time I was stuck in traffic for an hour.

315
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:31,130
It was like two to three times.

316
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:34,610
I tried my luck two more times with taking a taxi.

317
00:40:35,210 --> 00:42:05,670
And it was like, I was stuck in traffic for like an hour, like an hour twice after that like so you're like why didn't you take the subway why aren't you trying like what okay i had a fear i was i was scared that's why i was i was very scared um so the reason why i didn't take the subway is because i'm so used to asian subway asia subways and metros and subway in new york city um before like you know like eight plus years ago and and like it i remember the smell and like it was just scary like i and so then and then obviously my fear of the new york subway got worse because of the internet um so so i was just like i like i was like i was so like I was just so paranoid because remember guys remember that fucking one day a lady got burned alive in the fucking new york subway and no one did anything and then I thought I was like oh my god what if that was me I was like and then and then also like rat then there was like clips of like rant yeah there was a one time there was one time in

318
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:41,130
New York City a lady got burned it was that in Brooklyn I don't know I don't know it's just somewhere there like it was like slow it was like a PvP zone and like yeah and so like what I think a lot of people also got stabbed in the New York subway so like it it was in Konya it was close enough Konya Island is like next to New York like it's close enough like And then also,

319
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:53,270
also, also the fact that like, I would see clips of like, random people just going into the subway and just start singing and like performing.

320
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:54,610
And I don't fuck with that.

321
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:56,590
I don't fuck.

322
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:58,330
I was like, what if they get close to me?

323
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:00,810
Like, I don't, I don't fuck with that.

324
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:06,330
And also like clips of like crazy people in the subway doing crazy shit.

325
00:43:06,650 --> 00:44:30,010
And I'm just like thinking like, my god like I don't want to I don't want to deal with that and the smell too like I swear to God like it just smells like pee like so so I I got like I was just like oh my god like it's like GTA down there um so there's like and then people are just so used and then like all the New Yorkers are just so used to it too so um i don't want to be part of this and um and like yeah it just yeah and it just smells fucking terrible so um it's like a fucking pvp zone so that's why i like avoided the subway for so long because i got really scared uh so i was willing to tank the traffic also like i got worried that it was gonna be super crowded because i don't know when exactly I really worried that um that was gonna be like super fucking crowded um and everything um so um so like I I was worried I didn't want to get robbed or pickpocketed too because of it so I don't know when rush hour is and like when it ends like so I did I did it once I did use the subway once

326
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:38,050
and that was because we were going to um a Broadway show And then like, we saw the map.

327
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:41,750
We saw like, oh, it says 30 minutes.

328
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:43,450
And there were two roadblocks.

329
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:48,030
There were two roadblocks on the Google Maps.

330
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:49,730
But it said 30 minutes.

331
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:51,310
Like not roadblocks, but it was red.

332
00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:52,550
So it was like traffic jam.

333
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:55,110
So I was like, it says 30 minutes.

334
00:44:55,210 --> 00:44:58,750
But I know in my heart, it was going to be one hour.

335
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:01,390
Because I already tested it out.

336
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:59,710
it was 30 minutes and I see two red blocks like two red blocks indicating a traffic jam I know it's an hour it's not 30 minutes so I was like we should take the subway like this is it it says subway is 20 minutes and I think the subway is more correct yeah yeah I was like pattern recognition I was like I know the subway will actually be 20 minutes and then I you know we had to go to the Broadway show um we didn't want to be late so we're like because I got worried like oh man I got worried that we'd be late so I learned but luckily when we did the subway um it wasn't rush hour because I don't know when rush hour starts and ends in New York City because I feel Like,

337
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:07,210
I feel like, you know, like it's like all over the place depending on like what you work at So it smelled like pee.

338
00:46:07,570 --> 00:46:14,770
No, it still smelled like pee So luckily it was like, it wasn't even there were seats like there wasn't a lot.

339
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:36,330
It wasn't that busy To the point where we could actually sit down like thank fucking god and there were no like Random people performing and there was no one there that stabbed me like it just smells like pee At least, you know, I didn't have someone randomly stabbing me in the train.

340
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:39,670
Like, don't worry.

341
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:51,690
I brought hand sanitizer because I was like, like, if there was one time I need to use hand sanitizer, this will be it.

342
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:57,110
So I did bring hand sanitizer when I went into the subway.

343
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:30,130
Thank God That's the scent of Mark territory Patria said thank you for super chat Okay okay so By the way Doobie unlocked a new Fear of mine for me For the subway because I was like We're gonna take the subway And then okay I wrote this down Because I can't believe she said this to me I She She was like,

00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:42,270

363
00:49:34,620 --> 00:50:07,300
a cat but there was no cats so we took an uber back because i was like i'm tired like because i was like i'm not i'm not taking this subway back i i feel like it's the later it gets the scarier the scare i was thinking i was like i was like there's there might be you know less people and it gets scarier so i was just like i feel like i feel like it would be safer to take the the the Like a card ride back.

364
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:08,480
Because I was just thinking.

365
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:10,600
I don't know what to expect.

366
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:12,540
For a late night subway.

There might be more spawns coming out at night.

373
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,720
It's like the night in Minecraft.

374
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:25,020

So, yeah, so luckily, luckily I went.

390
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,600

the Onimusha playthrough, they said we could only play 30 minutes, so we got like really paranoid of being like, oh no, like, because the demo stops after 30 minutes, like you either complete the demo or the 30 minute thing, it like times up for you for 30 minutes.

414
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:23,720
So we got really paranoid because like we did Onimusha first.

415
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:27,400
So when we were in there, by the way, only one person can actually like play it.

416
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:57,740
to like the other watch so um I didn't play it for the Resident Evil because I was a pussy I was like I think you're gonna do me I because I didn't want to put the headphones on so I was like I was watching because I didn't I was a pussy um because it looked really fucking scary because like the newer Resident Evil games are actual like horror games compared to like you know So,

417
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:01,760
they actually made it so fucking scary.

418
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:04,460
The newer Resident Evil games.

419
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:07,060
It's no longer action.

420
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:09,640
It's just horror.

421
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:10,900
It's just...

422
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:17,400
So, we got really paranoid because we thought that...

423
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:20,260
Because, like, we weren't able to finish the...

424
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:23,040
Well, I wasn't able to finish the Onimusha demo.

425
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:27,120
I was literally still on a goddamn fucking boss fight.

426
00:55:27,400 --> 00:56:30,940
um that when the demo stopped they're like sorry demos over um i'm still trying to kill the boss um so so during the resident evil uh game we got worried that we won't be able to complete it in time so we're just skipping the cut scenes because so but it was funny because we were led in first and then the regular people were led in after us because we got like you know they let us in first to the demo room and then later on the people who actually lined up showed up and but we're already like past we did a lot of it already we were only like one third past the demo um so we i was looking to the side i was like god damn that is a long ass cut scene that we missed that we skipped but yeah because we saw like we saw like 10 seconds 15 seconds of the cut scene and we're like skip because we're like oh what if we don't complete the demo in time um but i looked to the side and i saw this guy the guy next to us watching the ass cutscene that we skipped it was like literally a five minute

427
00:56:30,940 --> 00:57:29,900
cutscene uh for the introduction um um for the intro to the demo and uh and so like i'll spoil it i don't even know where exactly we were in this game like it doesn't really tell you like you know because it's a demo so i i maybe it was the beginning but we you start out in the hospital and um and uh you're like trying to figure out how to fucking get out of the hospital like one area within the hospital and like you don't encounter a monster until like halfway and the monster itself is so fucking spooky it doesn't show i didn't i don't know if it came up in any of the reveal trailers but um she looked like i told dubie this i was because like um and i told her she looked like Lelorano.

428
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:30,940
Is that how we call it?

429
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:32,100
That, what is it?

430
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:38,220
You know that, that, the Lelorano, oh my god, Lelorano or something?

431
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:41,000
Um, is that how you pronounce it?

432
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:45,700
Lelor, um, but she looked like the monster version of her.

433
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,560
Um, you know, like the famous haunted house?

434
00:57:48,660 --> 00:58:28,920
Okay, uh, there's like a haunted house, whatever, where she fucking eats a chat, like, okay, this is what show you like a picture of this and then like this is what she looked like um this is from a haunted house but like this is what she looked like to me but like it's like the whole body as well uh like I remember seeing a picture of this in a haunted house okay this is literally what she looked like to me like I was like oh my god it looks like her uh la your la yorona la yorona but like It's her entire body.

435
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:32,620
This is a haunted house.

436
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,940
But this is what that monster looked like.

437
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,660
But she's like afraid of the light and everything.

438
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:39,080
So...

439
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:41,080
And she's like really fucking big.

440
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:44,960
She's like really tall.

441
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:48,320
And she's afraid of the light.

442
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:51,680
So we had to do like a loop-de-loop and everything.

443
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:53,680
Oh, also she wasn't wearing shoes.

444
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:55,300
Just this is like very important.

445
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:56,920
So we looked at the toes.

446
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:33,880
like we're like that's so brave of them to have her not wear shoes like i remember i was like wow so brave capcon so brave to not have her wear any shoes uh so we we had to make sure we looked we did look um the actual horror um i had to check for all of you guys you know i was here for the people So brave showing her toes to the public But yeah,

447
00:59:34,220 --> 01:00:28,860
no, like So you have to loop her around and stuff like that And then it was like a little mini puzzle with like using the light There's like, yeah, there's like lighter mechanic by the way Lighter mechanic is back There's lighter mechanic and And to loop around and she's afraid of the light So that's pretty good And then we finished the demo before the time limit too so i was like oh we should have just watched the cut scene if we are gonna finish it i was just like i was just like oh man we should have watched the cut scene i guess um but it was pretty interesting it looked really good um the new resident evil game because it it's like the other one the one with what's his name um i don't remember the guy's name you know the the Which is what I'm going to become soon.

448
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:34,460
Yeah, Ethan.

449
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:35,720
It's like his...

450
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:36,480
It's literally...

451
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,700
It's almost like...

452
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:42,640
I'd say it's more like Resident Evil 7 than 8.

453
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:43,980
Because 7 was...

454
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:46,780
I think 7 was more horror than 8.

455
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:48,900
8 felt more action-y.

456
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:50,460
I think.

457
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:52,280
Because like Ethan got...

458
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:54,280
Had like more mold powers, I guess.

459
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:56,320
I...

460
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:58,940
I guess he became more with the mold.

461
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:00,780
So he was more action-y in A.

462
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:03,420
But it definitely felt more like 7.

463
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:06,420
Felt more like 7.

464
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:08,200
Because it felt more like a horror game.

465
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:10,840
But like I said, we only did the demo for it.

466
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:12,060
And it was like one section.

467
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:14,360
So maybe it gets like more action-y later.

468
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:21,940
But the build-up was like more like you don't know what's going to happen.

469
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:23,740
Because there was just one enemy.

470
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:25,860
And you had to like stealth.

471
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:26,900
It was literally stealth.

472
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:57,950
in the beginning so like we didn't we couldn't kill anything the main character is a woman not ethan i don't remember who she is she's like related to someone i don't remember um i remember someone talked about who she's related to in the resident evil lore um i don't remember she's like some fun someone's fucking daughter i don't remember who she's someone she's someone's daughter i don't know whose daughter she is

473
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:26,180
hmm um so i she's a yeah she's a daughter of a character from outbreak yeah um she's also like a fucking pussy i guess because like it doesn't look like she knows how to use any weapons unless because i mean to be fair she was like locked up in a hospital so like it was like she didn't like she was like oh where am i and shit like that uh

474
01:02:30,320 --> 01:03:00,540
like me she was a pussy like me um oh my god so much to talk about really a lot of stuff i mean i was gone for a while yeah she's an analyst so like i don't think she was there for any she was not in the field for any action-y stuff um let's see what else happened um oh i went to i remember i think it was joe's pizza pizza time i didn't realize that was a real thing i didn't Spider-Man.

475
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:02,100
I literally went to Pizza Tab.

476
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:05,580
So, in Spider-Man, by the way, that's not home.

477
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:07,800
He's still at the dog sitter enjoying his time.

478
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:09,820
I don't know if I should show the photos of...

479
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:11,260
Okay, so, I don't know.

480
01:03:12,140 --> 01:03:14,340
But I'm jumping between a lot of times because a lot of stuff happened.

481
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:15,860
But...

482
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:18,700
You have to go to a new sitter.

483
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:19,720
This was a new dog sitter.

484
01:03:19,820 --> 01:03:25,680
I had to try... That I contacted last minute because my usual sitter couldn't do it because it was Canadian Thanksgiving.

485
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:29,780
It's crazy when I told, like, to be about Canadian Thanksgiving.

486
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:36,160
She was like, why is it on a different, why is it, why is it on a different month?

487
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:44,380
Because I was like, and I was like, well, it's because in America, you guys had the whole like Pilgrims thing, you know, the infamous Pilgrim dinner thing.

488
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:51,340
Well, in Canada, we're just thankful, like, we're just, we're like, we want Thanksgiving too, we're just thankful.

489
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:57,340
I mean, that's how it goes.

490
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:03,200
Yeah, we didn't have that historical event.

491
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:04,480
We're just thankful.

492
01:04:05,140 --> 01:04:07,580
Like, we want to be included.

493
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:13,560
Um, um, yeah.

494
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,780
Uh, just happy to be here.

495
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:16,480
Exactly.

496
01:04:17,780 --> 01:04:23,720
Um, it's, I don't even, like, I don't know why it's on the, I don't know why it's on that particular day.

497
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,800
I just know we have our own Thanksgiving.

498
01:04:26,360 --> 01:05:01,680
Uh, uh, uh, anyway so the the my current my usual dog sitter couldn't look after dad just because it's Canadian Thanksgiving so and they're already looking after another dog and they're like we don't know how this dog's gonna react to dad which is reasonable because dad's a fucking freak um he's unpredictable so um but so we put him at the new dog sitter and um and um He was like,

499
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:11,840
the new dog sitter, for some fucking reason, I tweeted about this, would send me pictures of him pooping.

500
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:15,920
And it wasn't like he was like almost done pooping or like he's about to poop.

501
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:17,840
It was like mid poop.

502
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:22,980
So like, but it's like one picture out of three that he sends every day.

503
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:29,600
But like every time he would send me, one of the pictures would be him mid poop.

504
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:41,180
Oh, but he did surprise me one day where he sent a picture of another dog that he was walking, pooping, and dad watching this other dog pooping.

505
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:42,360
It was a little surprise.

506
01:05:42,620 --> 01:05:43,640
It was a little Easter egg.

507
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:45,940
Like, it wasn't dad this time.

508
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:47,080
It was another dog.

509
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:48,680
But dad's watching.

510
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:59,940
So I was so confused because I was like, I was just like, why are you sending me?

511
01:05:59,960 --> 01:07:12,760
me these photos like a fun little side quest change it up a little bit fucking wild it was a wild thing um um zonder man thank you for the super chat thank you thank you way on canadian thanksgiving is objectively better what do you have to be thankful for in november balazar thank you for the super chat thank you thank you yeah i know exactly i was like the first time i was like second time I'm like oh okay you know I guess yeah it's still pretty silly and third time was when I got a little concerned I was just like okay maybe this is a little weird like this this is just this is just a little weird like um but now he's at he's back with the with his usual sitter now so like i'm getting him i'm getting him back tomorrow or maybe saturday depending on how i feel like i just want you know i want to cool down a little bit before i have to um before i'm being forced to be awake uh at seven in the morning to feed him so i just wanted to like you know i just wanted a little bit of a little

512
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:28,100
break before i had to go back to the routine that he established for me uh before i go back to his schedule um also i forgot to mention on saturday um I do have another sponsored stream on Saturday.

513
01:07:28,820 --> 01:07:30,540
This time it's for PUBG.

514
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:36,220
So I just wanted to let you guys know in advance that we are going to have another sponsored.

515
01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:37,340
It's on Twitch as well.

516
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:38,060
It'll be on Twitch.

517
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:40,480
So just giving you guys a heads up.

518
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:44,400
It's apparently something related to TwitchCon too.

519
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:46,240
Like I'll be playing with people at TwitchCon.

520
01:07:46,740 --> 01:07:47,480
But I'll be here.

521
01:07:47,540 --> 01:07:48,540
I'm not at TwitchCon.

522
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:52,060
I think I'm like one of the people who are not at TwitchCon.

523
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:54,460
I think like for me, I don't know.

524
01:07:54,460 --> 01:08:00,580
I don't think I don't know if I'll ever go to TwitchCon because I personally think TwitchCon is more of like I'm not a very social person.

525
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:02,160
I like meeting people one-on-one.

526
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:29,260
I don't like doing groups and stuff I feel like TwitchCon is more for like people to it's more like a networking mixer type of thing Because the convention itself, I guess there's like like, you know, like there's like It's not like Comic-Con where there's like so many like big booths and like big gaming companies and like other like stuff like that I feel like like Comic-Con TwitchCon is more like a mixer event for like other streamers or for like,

527
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:34,760
you know, chat, like chat to like potentially meet their favorite streamer.

528
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:36,980
And I heard it was scary.

529
01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:54,200
Like, not scary, but like people were like, I saw like lots of tweets about like safety measures of TwitchCon because like, you know, when you pack so many like celebrities, if you think about it, because it's, like, we're like, we're sort of like celebrities.

530
01:08:54,460 --> 01:09:17,960
You pack a lot of like celebrity stuff into like one convention It does get a lot scary and like in terms of like safety measures and stuff like that So like that also like that's why I was like I don't I don't feel comfortable going to TwitchCon Um, and I've always hear like safety issues and stuff too at the convention But like yeah,

531
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,560
because like I had like someone friends asking me are you going to TwitchCon?

532
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:30,140
I was like, no, I'm gonna go to a comic con Also, it's easier to be incognito at Comic-Con compared to, like, TwitchCon.

533
01:09:32,820 --> 01:09:45,080
Because I remember, I remember, like, I remember, like, asking, like, my friend, one of my friends, like, how, like, like, what do you do at TwitchCon?

534
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:53,700
Because I only went to TwitchCon once a long time ago, but that was just to, it was, like, a long, long time ago, but it was as an artist.

535
01:09:54,560 --> 01:10:18,280
And I was just like I didn't do anything other than like go around the convention like I didn't do any fucking parties or anything Because like I heard there's a lot of parties too at twitch con too for like streamers and stuff So it's literally just like a mixer networking thing Where you can like network with other streamers and meet other streamers and you know meet your friends who are also streamers and stuff But like I said for me,

536
01:10:18,280 --> 01:11:28,800
I prefer like one-on-one interaction like you know not like interaction like in a group and setting I prefer one-on-one like I do with Duby because um, I'm not I'm I'm an introvert so I'm not like a huge like talkative person in a group environment and I do feel like super uncomfortable too in a group environment so um especially like I'm worried about like getting docs too that's oh my god this is like so scary but like I remember like um I remember like during like I heard like there were stories of like other streamers doxing like other streamers like be like yeah you know that one that's actually that vtuber and I was like that's fucked up like I heard stories about that too because they were all like people were all at this one party I don't remember which party it was it was like I don't know like a partner's party or whatever or like a Twitch party um it was like it was one of the parties I don't know maybe it was like a v-shōjo party or something because I think it could have

537
01:11:28,800 --> 01:12:30,940
been the v-shō, like back then when v-shōjo existed but like a v-shō-shō party and I heard stories of like other streamers were doxing others being like yeah like oh my god that's actually blah blah blah and stuff like that and I was like that's so messed up because it's supposed to be a private thing you're supposed to feel safe and everything um you're supposed to like feel safe in that environment especially when it's like a party for like other like for streamers that were invited by like you know by like um a company or like invite like that's being managed by this part but it's not it's not on b-show's fault it's just like there was no etiquette you know like you know there's like the guests it themselves weren't practicing and they love you know gossiping and stuff like that too um you know like gossiping and stuff so other like a streamer only event and I that's what makes me afraid of going to these events and going to these parties um because like why the like you know you're

538
01:12:30,940 --> 01:13:08,860
going there because you you wanted to feel safe with other streamers but it's just how like other streamers would dox you know other streamers like you don't know this person is and you're like oh my god is this guy you know that guy he's actually this person and it's just it's just weird it's just it makes me so paranoid too yeah that's what i mean that's what i like um i like one-on-one socialization like socializing with one-on-one people people i know i don't want to be in a like a big ass group and i don't know half the people there yeah

539
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:28,880
I, yeah, so, so I don't know, I don't know if I ever wonder, if I'll ever go to TwitchCon, um, like I said, like, I know it's like more like a network, like meeting other people, networking and stuff like that, um, but, um, I'm really, I'm a really shy person in general,

540
01:13:29,480 --> 01:14:04,260
and, um, also like, like I said, I'm very private, I'm a very private person, so that's why I don't like like um like if i i'm more likely to send a staff member at twitch con than me going myself like it was like oh hey if you want to talk to someone or meet up with someone like you meet up with like an event i actually do have a staff member at twitch con like because he's going there for himself but like i do have a staff there that is at twitch con right now so so so like if Like,

541
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:09,680
you know, if he wants to try and, like, network or, like, talk to any businesses or events and stuff.

542
01:14:09,740 --> 01:14:11,760
I heard you can get a lot of free stuff, though.

543
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:19,420
If you're a partner and you talk to, like, the booths that's there at TwitchCon, apparently we tell them you're a partner.

544
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:20,720
They'll give you free shit.

545
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:24,200
That's what I heard.

546
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:27,740
So, like, I guess, like, there's that benefit, too.

547
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:34,060
Like, you get free stuff from, like, the booths and stuff that's at TwitchCon.

548
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:38,940
like um and everything um yeah

549
01:14:43,380 --> 01:15:06,640
uh anyway what was I gonna talk about oh yeah um so um we didn't finish all of comic-con too we only did like half of comic-con which makes me really sad because I was like oh if I was here earlier if I didn't miss my flight we could have done more so I felt really bad um because I didn't realize how big it was!

550
01:15:07,060 --> 01:15:07,820
It was...

551
01:15:07,820 --> 01:15:09,660
Okay, Comic-Con was thinking it's...

552
01:15:09,660 --> 01:15:10,840
Let me see if I can grab a photo.

553
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:11,500
I'll grab a photo.

554
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:15,020
I took a photo of Comic-Con of, like, how many people there were.

555
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:16,360
I didn't take the inside.

556
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:24,180
But I took, like, a photo of, like, me looking down.

557
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:27,240
Like, me just, like, seeing how many people there were there.

558
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:28,640
It was crazy.

559
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,340
I was not expecting that.

560
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:33,840
It's huge.

561
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:36,360
the biggest convention I've ever been to.

562
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:38,600
I don't think I've ever been to convention this.

563
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:39,220
I'm going to make sure.

564
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:40,480
Like, there's no.

565
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:45,020
It was literally the biggest convention I've ever been to.

566
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:50,180
And this was just like it was just me.

567
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:52,900
Like, there were so many people.

568
01:15:52,980 --> 01:15:54,900
This wasn't even inside the exhibitor hall.

569
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:56,340
This was outside.

570
01:15:56,480 --> 01:16:04,000
Like, the leading... And there's like two... Left side was the panels and right side was the exhibitor hall and artist alley.

571
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:11,460
And there were so many people, like, just outside and, like, just, like, walking towards the exhibitor hall.

572
01:16:11,620 --> 01:16:12,840
Yeah, that's just the outside.

573
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:14,840
Also, it was raining.

574
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:18,260
Dubit loved, I learned a lot about her.

575
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:22,900
She actually loves, like, learning about the weather.

576
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,580
Like, just she loves, like, weather patterns and everything.

577
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:33,740
So she was, like, really hyped to see, like, oh, I can't, I want to see how the rain, how it looks like inside this convention hall while it's raining.

578
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:35,640
Um, so it was very interesting.

579
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:40,100
Um, also, like, you know, she loves aliens and stuff.

580
01:16:40,420 --> 01:16:46,120
So, like, I didn't realize that she's a huge nerd about this.

581
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:50,660
But, um, she was giving me, like, insight about aliens.

582
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:53,260
Because she actually carries, like, a tiny telescope.

583
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:59,080
Like, those, like, little, like, those handheld telescope things to look for UFO sightings and stuff.

584
01:16:59,140 --> 01:17:00,340
I thought it was so interesting.

585
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:03,180
I was like, oh, I didn't know that's, like, a thing.

586
01:17:03,180 --> 01:17:33,840
yeah so she carries she carries like a little telescope and stuff to look for it see if there's any UFO sightings at night um and um and I like asked her about like she apparently she's she went through like Roswell and stuff too and I was like because she loves like no she she loves knowing more about like you know like aliens and stuff like that so I thought it was really interesting to like pick her brain about everything about like um um um Like,

587
01:17:33,860 --> 01:17:42,760
I thought, like, you know, the alien stuff was, like, more like, just like a, I guess what's the word called?

588
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:49,320
Like, you know how I have, like, have a Doe Kitty and stuff like that?

589
01:17:49,640 --> 01:18:02,900
You know, I thought the alien thing was just, like, a cute little gimmick, but it's, like, like, but she's, like, super interested in it, like, she's actually, like, really interested in it.

590
01:18:03,180 --> 01:19:01,920
like actually like know so much because I was like picking her brain about like what she knows and like stories and stuff um and it was super interesting like I like I thought it was really cute that she carries a little telescope just in case there's a UFO sighting uh yeah yeah I thought it was just like an aesthetic gimmick thing like do kitty uh but like um but she's like super into the whole like paranormal stuff and uh the paranormal and um um and aliens so it's like really interesting to like hear her stories about it uh let's see what else uh but yeah we only did like 50 of comic con so i i really wanted to go back to comic con again um in the future because um i you know i i found it like really fun to walk around and like there were so many like interesting boosts and everything it was like

01:20:47,100 --> 01:21:00,580
Um, um, but yeah, no, oh, every time we saw, like, um, during the artist's alley, uh, she bought a lot of, uh, Tamagotchi and alien merch and stuff, so it was really cute.

598
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:20,360

600
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:35,080
Because I wanted to, I didn't, I wanted to match with someone, because I, so I'm shadow, I'm shadow and she's, Sonic and in the back there's like little wings and stuff to it.

601
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:36,340
It's so cute.

602
01:21:36,580 --> 01:21:44,240
It's it's so it's so cute.

603
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:46,580
I love the dinners

604
01:21:49,940 --> 01:23:23,700
so so we own these shirts now um what else oh my gosh oh wait let me go back from the beginning so there there was there there's a pizza story that's which is the real spider-man pizzas you know what peter parker does his delivery where he's like if you don't get your pizza in 30 in 30 minutes or less you get a free pizza so it's literally a real place like pizza time and like apparently a lot of celebrities actually go to that pizza restaurant so like there are photos of like All the celebrities that's been there like fucking Conan O'Brien Jimmy Fallon The rest I'm sorry I don't remember the oh the Ghostbuster guy forgot his name The Ghostbuster man he also there's like a photo of him too But apparently this place is like By the way um we were there at i think like 1 a.m and it was packed at one in the morning yeah bill murray there's a photo of bill murray there and uh we were there at one in the fucking morning at this restaurant and it was already like there was a line it was

605
01:23:23,700 --> 01:23:55,180
packed inside and it was the morning i was not yeah they were full at and i was like if this is full at one in the morning i'm like thinking when the tourists are awake you know like that like actual tourists there um like um you would think that like it would be even worse like i was thinking about it i was like it would have been so fucking worse if it was like actual like morning or like you know at a regular time

606
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:24,880
so um so i was like it was i was like damn like i'm glad like i'm glad because apparently like you know when we're there it wasn't that it was still full but i was thinking like if it was like at an actual regular decent hour um um it would be a lot like it would be like a lot uh a lot more fully packed because of the tourists.

607
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:28,220
By the way, I forgot Columbus Day was a fucking thing.

608
01:24:28,900 --> 01:24:42,720
Okay, so Jimmy and I weren't together all the time because she was with her aunt too because she brought her she brought her aunt a lot and her aunt is like a huge, also like a huge Broadway enthusiast.

609
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:47,800
So sometimes she was with her aunt and so sometimes I was exploring New York by myself.

610
01:24:48,880 --> 01:25:03,800
So I went to the Museum of Ice Cream and Um, I was like wondering why there were so many fucking children like Yeah, I was like, don't you kids have school?

611
01:25:04,100 --> 01:25:07,900
Like I was so I was so confused.

612
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:12,860
I was like, why there's so many kids here?

613
01:25:13,380 --> 01:25:16,240
I was like, I was like, don't you have to go to school?

614
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:19,700
Like did you did your parents take you out?

615
01:25:22,820 --> 01:25:26,920
some, like, just to fucking go to the museum of ice cream.

616
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:29,300
So I was like so confused.

617
01:25:29,540 --> 01:25:33,000
I was like, why are so many children here?

618
01:25:35,460 --> 01:25:38,140
Yes, but it's also a Monday.

619
01:25:38,540 --> 01:25:40,660
I was like, it's a Monday.

620
01:25:41,300 --> 01:25:44,100
So I didn't, no, they were, it wasn't like a field trip.

621
01:25:44,160 --> 01:25:47,220
It was just literally parents, like parents bringing their kids.

622
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:48,720
So I know it wasn't a field trip.

623
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:51,140
It was like parents bring their children.

624
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:58,040
So I, I even said that a lot of myself, I was like, isn't it a school where there's so many children?

625
01:25:58,260 --> 01:25:59,700
Isn't it a school day?

626
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:01,560
It was so confused.

627
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:09,340
And then later on, I found out it was Columbus Day because a lot of places were like closed or like closed early.

628
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:12,000
But I'm just like, how is Columbus Day a holiday?

629
01:26:17,320 --> 01:26:18,960
I was so confused.

630
01:26:19,180 --> 01:26:22,800
I was like, I did not realize Columbus Day was a real ass holiday.

631
01:26:22,820 --> 01:26:23,200
day.

632
01:26:23,740 --> 01:26:33,240
I thought you would still have to, I thought you celebrate like that day, like at school, because it's like an, it's like an educational day.

633
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:43,480
I didn't think like this, I don't know, I didn't think like actual businesses would like take the day off because I was like, what, I was just so confused.

634
01:26:43,860 --> 01:26:46,640
I thought this was more like a school day, you know?

635
01:26:46,980 --> 01:26:47,460
Uh,

636
01:26:52,820 --> 01:28:05,040
uh school day instead of like an actual like day off like um um oh yeah let me show you guys joe's pizza wait let me double check i need to double check all photos just in case you know um but yeah here's joe's pizza see like see look at all the photos of the celebrity but also I seen you saw us in spider-man it's literally pizza time I literally came went to the pizza time restaurant uh yeah it was like a wall full of photos like um a wall full of uh photos of celebrities being like you're all the celebrities that went to joe's pizza um yeah it's like as seen in spider-man everyone looked at it I was like wait spider-man because like one of my friends recommended me um recommended me to check it out but i didn't realize because they're like this is one of the best pizza places in new york city so i was like i was like really oh man i was checking it out and it was like one in the morning and i was just like it's still open so uh

637
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:19,540
so i was just like i was just like yeah i was like spider-man wait i'm at pizza time i'm literally It was really good.

638
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:20,900
It was really...

639
01:28:20,900 --> 01:28:23,940
I was so tempted because there was a little Italy tail.

640
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:26,240
It was like near me, near my hotel.

641
01:28:26,380 --> 01:28:29,440
And I was so tempted to just like eat pasta every day.

642
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:30,200
But I tried not to.

643
01:28:30,220 --> 01:28:31,920
I tried to like diversify.

644
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:33,940
So I had like, you know, I had...

645
01:28:33,940 --> 01:28:34,320
I went to...

646
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:40,120
Oh, there was like this really cool Mexican place called Los Tacos.

647
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:41,240
It was so...

648
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:43,480
Oh my God, the tacos were so good.

649
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:48,720
I felt really bad because like there wasn't any gluten-free options.

650
01:28:48,780 --> 01:30:04,780
so because dubia couldn't um couldn't eat it like she ate a bite she was like yolo out she had she had a bite but obviously um um she can't she couldn't have uh like she couldn't have like tacos because it's not gluten-free um and also there's like contamination too um so but she had of i was like uh because we thought there would be we didn't realize like they um we didn't realize like the the thing was contaminated and stuff so um with gluten because we were thinking like oh maybe there's gluten-free option but then we saw the kitchen and it was like all you know like the gluten-free stuff was going to be contaminated with the gluten stuff so we're like uh no like the thing is like we were the uh we were worried that it was contaminated you know like uh um like the gluten stuff would be contaminating the non-gluten stuff because it's all like in one kitchen so um so like we were worried about that so like she had like a bite and she's like yo yo yeah yeah so that's why we we didn't

651
01:30:04,780 --> 01:30:40,900
want to risk it but it was good it was really good I don't have a lot of Mexican food because like I say um Mexican food is sort of Um, and then also like in my part when I was growing up here in Canada Um, it was also sort of non-existent here too because we are so north from the south like Like it's understandable because like um the west coast was so like because you know We're in the very north side of North America so

652
01:30:46,700 --> 01:32:01,320
um um so it was like very far so there was not a lot of like mexican food or even like self-american food now there is now there is um now um but like back then it was like um it was like almost non-existent and um also like in asia too it was definitely not i wrote i told you guys a story before i know you guys are like taco bell doesn't count but um one time um a taco bell opened like um in shenzhen one time when i used to live in shenzhen um it opened it was like i've never seen a taco bell before this like in person i always see them in tv shows and i'm like oh my god is that a real thing um and a taco bell opened um in the city and it was the first time i've ever seen a taco bell like i i was living there already for like like I think like five years and then I saw a taco bell like it was a grand opening um it went out of business in one month uh it went out of business after a month it disappeared like

655
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:43,680
and I was there and I was so confused and then the waiter the employee came in at 1030 like at um at uh 1015 and she was like yeah we open at 1030 now and I was like but it says 10 on the thing and it says 10 on the the Google Maps I was so confused so that waited at 1030 and then the chefs were coming in and then the chefs were like sorry we're opening at 11 a.m now and i'm like what the just like what what the fuck

656
01:34:46,860 --> 01:36:16,460
because on the window it says 10 in the morning and the funny shit was was that in two days um in two days they had like this paper yeah sorry the time on the window is right they like got piece of paper and then wrote like and then taped it on the glass it was like 11 a.m to like that like it was taped two days later it was taped on the glass but they've been open for like a week already so i was so confused anyway for those who are wondering what the fuck is french ramen it's deconstructed ramen it's so weird i took it's it's deconstructed it ramen it was so fucking weird like that's what french ramen is let me double check the photo so like the toppings were like put on the side even i don't know it looks very french it it really did look very french look but i don't think the rest it was all right it was good But I don't think the restaurant's gonna survive like like this like this this is what I mean This is what I mean this is a French ramen um but I had by the way I had a

657
01:36:16,460 --> 01:36:27,120
truffle I had a truffle um salmon wrap I know truffle by the way also it's truffle I thought the prop is truffle

658
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:33,800
The noodles under the Sabbath.

659
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:37,380
It was like, it was like $28.

660
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:42,440
But, but you can tell why Duby was like, I'm not coming here with you.

661
01:36:42,580 --> 01:36:43,840
But I was so curious.

662
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:45,680
I was so curious.

663
01:36:45,740 --> 01:36:49,040
I was like, what the fuck is French ramen?

664
01:36:57,540 --> 01:36:58,660
Um, so...

665
01:36:58,680 --> 01:37:00,500
Oh, yeah, it looks like a penis, too.

666
01:37:00,740 --> 01:37:04,380
Yeah, it's the corn and the tomato.

667
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:14,100
So that's, yeah, she died because I was so curious.

668
01:37:14,360 --> 01:37:15,460
I was like, what the fuck?

669
01:37:15,460 --> 01:37:17,480
Because I kept passing it by.

670
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:19,760
I kept passing it by.

671
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:23,320
So I was like, oh, my God, I should really try this.

672
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:28,660
French ramen place because I need to know what the fuck is French ramen.

673
01:37:28,680 --> 01:37:30,640
I had to know I

674
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:38,440
It was interesting.

675
01:37:38,700 --> 01:37:39,400
It was all right.

676
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:40,060
It was good.

677
01:37:40,580 --> 01:37:43,880
I won't say like it was the best ramen I've ever had It was all right.

678
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:44,460
It was good.

679
01:37:44,840 --> 01:37:45,900
It was just weird.

680
01:37:46,200 --> 01:38:56,320
It was just so weird That's all I could explain it was it was so fucking weird because like they don't give you eggs to they don't give you like um the eggs like um with the ramen there's no you have to order it as a side topping so um so like okay here i ordered eggs and i also ordered an appetizer because i was just like fuck it why not so i ordered like some it was like beef with potato salad it was good though that shit was actually pretty good um but yeah so so it was like so i had to separately order the eggs as a topping and I also ordered like an appetizer with like a beef and the potato salad I don't fucking it was pretty good though it was pretty good and then I ordered I didn't realize that my ramen actually came with like beef because it said salmon and I could barely tell like what the okay so it came with like I could barely tell because like look at this it's fucking deconstructed ramen so they already had like a strip of beef and like a strip of chicken on the side

681
01:39:02,340 --> 01:39:23,400
So I didn't realize, so I ordered a side of Tasu Because I thought that Or like pork, I guess that, I don't know, I guess I don't know, I think that was Tasu, I guess it was pork Because I couldn't tell I didn't realize that they already had So I ordered a side of dish of that Not like The pee-pee corn,

682
01:39:23,460 --> 01:40:39,240
I mean look at it I think it was a rare gift so anyway so i had french ramen it was an experience because i was like you know when you're in new york city uh when you're in new york city uh you um it's you know you gotta try the weird shit too you know like you gotta you're in new york city you gotta try the weird fucking shit that the pretentious chefs make in that city like because it's like the only time you can so that was my that was my my one restaurant where i tried the pretentious like the french ramen uh because like i feel like this is the only place where it's like la like the quirky little restaurants you know little quirky things that you can get no i i didn't try to the cars the halal food because i did that like i did it when i was in the last time i was in new york city um it was a long time ago um you know like eight years ago last time I was there um I did I had I tried that once before and I don't I'm too scared because it depends on the cart you know like um because

683
01:40:39,240 --> 01:41:24,720
I one time I tried a I remembered um when I was with a group of friends in New York City like eight plus years ago and um it was late at night and we're like we should get a hot dog and it was like the carts you know yeah the hot dog carts and is it very surprising that we got food poisoning right after like so i'm not i i i learned like you know i don't risk it anymore i i even we don't we don't risk that shit anymore like the cards that like yeah that sounds about right yeah so it's like a gotcha with food so i i'm not risking

684
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:36,940
yeah um what else i have so much stuff to tell you but i need to pee right now so i'll be right back

Do you see it?

769
01:58:49,320 --> 01:58:55,620
Did you, did you, do you see it child erase from existence?

770
01:58:58,220 --> 01:58:59,440
Did you see it?

771
01:59:00,920 --> 01:59:02,820
Did you see it?

772
01:59:04,720 --> 01:59:05,760
Did you see it?

773
01:59:09,960 --> 01:59:12,420
I was trying to erase it.

774
01:59:12,740 --> 01:59:17,380
I was trying to, I was trying to AI erase it.

775
01:59:17,480 --> 01:59:18,500
It looks very bad.

776
01:59:18,940 --> 01:59:21,940
The ghost of banana-past...

777
01:59:24,600 --> 01:59:27,400
Broca replaced by AI.

778
01:59:27,740 --> 01:59:30,260
He's part of the art now.

779
01:59:30,500 --> 01:59:33,000
Getting a banana pie.

780
01:59:33,880 --> 01:59:34,140
Anyway.

781
01:59:36,720 --> 01:59:37,100
Anyway.

782
01:59:38,100 --> 01:59:41,000
Here's a picture.

783
01:59:41,500 --> 01:59:42,100
We were here.

784
01:59:42,620 --> 01:59:43,520
The Lion King.

785
01:59:44,220 --> 01:59:46,200
That's why Duby was singing that in karaoke.

786
01:59:51,420 --> 01:59:56,240
That's why she was singing it because we literally, we literally watched the Lion King musical.

787
01:59:59,860 --> 02:00:03,220
Um, yeah, it's cute.

788
02:00:03,780 --> 02:00:04,820
It's so cute.

789
02:00:05,300 --> 02:00:07,540
There's us right here.

790
02:00:10,140 --> 02:00:11,440
Yeah, there's us.

791
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:14,600
And then we had like Latin American food right after.

792
02:00:14,700 --> 02:00:15,320
It was so good.

793
02:00:16,900 --> 02:00:19,040
She like, what is it called, Papadel?

794
02:00:19,540 --> 02:00:21,360
No, it's a Papapapai.

795
02:00:21,500 --> 02:00:22,700
I don't remember what it's called.

796
02:00:23,120 --> 02:00:25,340
But she was like, we have to get this to share.

797
02:00:25,420 --> 02:00:27,640
It was like this rice seafood dish.

798
02:00:28,040 --> 02:00:29,740
It was so good.

799
02:00:30,340 --> 02:00:31,520
Oh my, I don't know.

800
02:00:31,580 --> 02:00:32,600
I don't remember what it's called.

801
02:00:35,080 --> 02:00:37,640
Um, what was it called?

802
02:00:37,820 --> 02:00:42,660
It starts with a P where it was basically like, uh, Paella?

803
02:00:42,880 --> 02:00:43,220
Paella?

804
02:00:43,620 --> 02:00:44,020
Paella?

805
02:00:44,020 --> 02:00:44,220
Paella?

806
02:00:45,520 --> 02:00:47,720
Yeah, she was like, we have to get paella.

807
02:00:48,140 --> 02:00:48,540
Paella?

808
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:49,940
Is that how you pronounce it?

809
02:00:50,220 --> 02:00:51,760
She was like, we have to get it.

810
02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:54,940
Because like, we saw someone on their table eating it.

811
02:00:55,020 --> 02:00:56,460
And you're like, it's a really good...

812
02:00:56,460 --> 02:00:58,080
Like, usually you eat a shared...

813
02:00:58,080 --> 02:01:00,960
Like, you eat a shared dish.

814
02:01:02,120 --> 02:01:02,520
Um...

815
02:01:03,260 --> 02:01:03,660
Um...

816
02:01:04,240 --> 02:01:04,640
Um...

817
02:01:04,640 --> 02:01:05,840
With a bunch of...

818
02:01:05,840 --> 02:01:07,620
Like, with a bunch of friends or family.

819
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:08,760
And, um...

820
02:01:08,760 --> 02:01:11,160
And, like, we ordered it as, like, a shared dish.

821
02:01:11,260 --> 02:01:13,240
And it was so good.

822
02:01:13,360 --> 02:01:14,000
Oh, my...

823
02:01:14,020 --> 02:01:45,840
god it was at it was so we both hated the muscles though because we're not none of us were in muscles people so we didn't do that but oh my god it was so good oh it just sucked because like if our hotel room had a fridge i would have um i would have like kept it for like the next day um but we we didn't have a fridge so um so we couldn't eat it yeah but Oh my god.

824
02:01:47,020 --> 02:01:48,040
Describes a dish.

825
02:01:48,440 --> 02:01:53,160
Oh, it was, well, the restaurant itself said it was like Latin American.

826
02:01:53,740 --> 02:01:57,060
That's what the restaurant, like the restaurant description is.

827
02:01:57,240 --> 02:01:59,040
It was like Latin American food.

828
02:01:59,360 --> 02:02:02,240
So I just assume it was also Latin American.

829
02:02:06,360 --> 02:02:08,120
Next seat, thank you for the super chat.

830
02:02:08,180 --> 02:02:08,920
Thank you, thank you.

831
02:02:08,920 --> 02:02:10,600
So I didn't know it was Spanish.

832
02:02:14,020 --> 02:02:17,200
because the restaurant itself said Latin American.

833
02:02:18,100 --> 02:02:19,540
So I thought it was also Latin.

834
02:02:19,680 --> 02:02:22,220
It was, I didn't realize it was from Spain.

835
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:25,520
It's a common, oh, Paia is a common dish in Latin America.

836
02:02:25,620 --> 02:02:26,140
There we go.

837
02:02:26,440 --> 02:02:32,400
I don't know much about, I don't know much about like, because I was so, I was so north.

838
02:02:32,940 --> 02:02:39,440
And also so, I lived in a lot of places that was very far away from South America.

839
02:02:40,060 --> 02:02:47,000
So I don't know much about like Latin American food or just like, Spanish food in general because I was so far away.

840
02:02:48,320 --> 02:02:51,760
I never had the opportunity to try a lot of these dishes out.

841
02:02:52,180 --> 02:02:59,800
So like Duby was introducing me a lot to like, um, to like self-American food or like Spanish food in general.

842
02:03:00,180 --> 02:03:01,900
Um, because I don't have a lot of experience.

843
02:03:02,220 --> 02:03:08,220
Uh, I don't have a lot of experience eating these types of food in general because I didn't grow up with it.

844
02:03:08,740 --> 02:03:39,520
Um, but it was so good oh my god it was i wish i want more i want more of that uh yeah and then she was talking to me about like these dried chips i don't remember what it's called um because it's very common also in south america um what are these there was these like dried chips um i don't remember what it's called uh uh plantains yes plantains yes Yes,

845
02:03:39,580 --> 02:03:40,760
I think plantain chips.

846
02:03:40,880 --> 02:03:41,460
Yes, yes.

847
02:03:41,900 --> 02:03:42,660
Those were good.

848
02:03:43,860 --> 02:03:46,140
Because she was like, oh, you gotta try plantain.

849
02:03:46,320 --> 02:03:49,540
Like the stuff inside the plantain.

850
02:03:49,920 --> 02:03:51,360
And also the chips itself.

851
02:03:51,640 --> 02:03:52,960
And they were really, really good.

852
02:03:53,220 --> 02:03:55,220
Yeah, she was like introducing me to...

853
02:03:57,060 --> 02:03:57,920
To all of it.

854
02:03:58,140 --> 02:04:00,380
Also, apparently she told this story before.

855
02:04:00,620 --> 02:04:01,980
But I didn't know about this story.

856
02:04:02,260 --> 02:04:03,720
I'm going to tell this story to you guys.

857
02:04:03,760 --> 02:04:05,080
For those who don't watch Doobie.

858
02:04:05,460 --> 02:04:08,140
But she said she told this story before on stream.

859
02:04:08,720 --> 02:04:09,160
And...

860
02:04:09,220 --> 02:05:23,200
basically when she was like while we're eating we were talking about like um you know our personal life and stuff like that like you know like where we came from and stuff like that so we got we're getting to know each other a lot more and she was like oh yeah like um when she was younger um she had access to like you know she did her own thing in the piece on the PCs at school so you guys might remember this story I did not know like I did not know this story so um she would like you know fuck around on the PCs at school and um during one of those times she found acts like she realized she could talk to like um I guess like FBI I don't even know like police officers or some shit I know it's like she found like those like chat yeah the recruiter yeah it's like a to like recruiters on the websites and stuff as a live chat and then she was like there's a bomb like she was like i have a bomb at this school i have a bomb at this at this school and then the recruiter was like this is not a

861
02:05:23,200 --> 02:05:53,680
joke this is where i have your ip address right now and like the recruiter gave her like the IP and then and like um she made a bomb thread when she was like young like um I think like elementary slash middle school she made a fucking bomb thread and then the recruiter was like this is not a joke this is your here's your IP address

862
02:05:58,700 --> 02:06:05,780
And then she just like closed the website instantly the moment the recruiter gave her IP, she closed the, she closed the chat.

863
02:06:06,240 --> 02:06:10,560
And I straight up told her, I was like, were you on Newgrounds, kid?

864
02:06:10,980 --> 02:06:19,000
I was like, I'm like, were you on Newgrounds, kid?

865
02:06:19,380 --> 02:06:24,080
Because that's the only explanation I could think of.

866
02:06:24,140 --> 02:06:27,280
I'm going to make a fucking bomb threat.

867
02:06:29,460 --> 02:06:31,580
And then she was like, no, I'm never.

868
02:06:31,600 --> 02:07:04,860
actually never been on new grounds I was like holy shit I was the most holy thank you for the raising thank you surprisingly surprisingly she's never been on new grounds before which was the most surprising fight for me yeah yeah that was yeah I'm only telling the story because like Apparently she told a story before on stream.

869
02:07:05,320 --> 02:07:07,960
I was like, holy shit, you're wild, girl.

870
02:07:08,480 --> 02:07:09,820
You're fucking wild.

02:08:07,310 --> 02:08:11,570
like, a lot of really, um, good breakfast places around New York City.

881
02:08:11,730 --> 02:08:14,990
Okay, like, I fucking hate the traffic, though, in New York.

882
02:08:14,990 --> 02:08:18,690
That was, like, other than that, it was a lot of really, yeah, my last supper.

883
02:08:19,050 --> 02:08:26,250
There's a lot of, like, really, um, really good places to eat around New York City.

884
02:08:26,450 --> 02:08:29,690
Like, ah, if I could have stayed a couple more days, I would just be eating.

885
02:08:30,650 --> 02:08:33,630
I'd just be exploring the restaurants around.

886
02:08:34,490 --> 02:08:34,810
Hmm.

887
02:08:35,710 --> 02:08:36,150
Okay.

888
02:08:37,850 --> 02:08:39,970
Um, wait, let me...

889
02:08:40,530 --> 02:08:43,410
Do I still have any more cough drops?

890
02:08:44,350 --> 02:08:44,950
Check.

891
02:08:45,550 --> 02:08:47,110
Where are my cough drops?

892
02:08:48,230 --> 02:08:50,250
I swear I had another box of them.

893
02:08:51,550 --> 02:08:53,850
I guess I don't.

894
02:08:54,450 --> 02:08:55,570
I swear I did.

895
02:08:56,010 --> 02:08:57,370
I guess I was wrong.

896
02:08:58,050 --> 02:08:58,530
Oh, well.

897
02:08:58,890 --> 02:09:00,390
I ordered more later.

898
02:09:01,130 --> 02:09:01,730
Um, oh yeah.

899
02:09:01,950 --> 02:09:05,670
Anyway, I went to a comedy club.

900
02:09:06,190 --> 02:09:06,890
Um...

901
02:09:06,970 --> 02:09:30,870
in new york city um i did i bought like two boxes but i don't know where i put them um this is why this like i said this fucking this trip was a wake-up call i was i'm a mess uh baby koala i think it was super chat thinking thank you yes i went to a comedy club um uh uh db didn't come with me um because it was also really late it was like 11 30.

902
02:09:30,930 --> 02:10:41,350
i went to 11 30 show because it was the only show um that was available on that day so because I was like you know when you're in New York City you have to go to a comic it's like such an iconic thing because it was like I went to the seller the comedy seller which is like the most famous comedy club because like I was hoping you know like like it's hoping like oh maybe a really maybe like you know a celebrity comedian will show up you know because sometimes um if you're really lucky also it didn't happen if you're really lucky a celebrity commute like a big celebrity comedian might show up um for one that shows you know to do a set because they sometimes visit the comedy seller because a lot of them um um a lot of them like had their start um at the comedy seller so it's like the place to go um it was really okay what was really crazy was um um they like take your phones by the way uh you're not allowed to go in with your phones because they don't want you recording anything because

903
02:10:41,350 --> 02:10:49,130
sometimes i guess like um because like by the way new yorkers love to talk to people like fucking talk to strangers uh

904
02:10:52,710 --> 02:11:15,710
they love to talk to strangers um is they're like oh is this your first time i was like yeah This is my first time here and basically the reason why is that some comedians there They they like try out new sets or like try out new bits and stuff and they don't want that recorded So like if it's real it's a really bad joke.

905
02:11:15,730 --> 02:12:00,510
They don't want that recorded or anything So so that's why they they have you like Lock your they basically give you like this little envelope and you have to seal your phone it um yeah they're like testing the waters before it gets recorded like before they make a special and everything anyway i'm gonna steal two jokes from them um there were a lot of sets like it was like i think like it was like seven comedians that day for my the show i wasn't i um it was so long because like i left that like like it started at 11 30 and i left that two in the morning um but There were two jokes I really liked,

906
02:12:00,610 --> 02:12:08,830
and I really was, okay, so, um, one of them was, okay, I'm, me retelling it might not be as funny, but I was like, holy fuck.

907
02:12:09,190 --> 02:12:23,730
So, one of them was that basically, um, um, she has a friend that she's like, oh, he's like such a bore, but like, I, um, but like, you know, he's part of the group, and then she was saying, like, how, like, yeah, because all his, like, his parents died,

908
02:12:23,810 --> 02:12:28,610
like, all his family died in some freak accident.

909
02:12:28,630 --> 02:12:31,610
And I was like, holy fuck, right?

910
02:12:31,870 --> 02:12:34,130
And then I was like, I was like, what?

911
02:12:36,630 --> 02:12:43,470
Just like, yeah, there's my friend, one friend, like, you know, we can't really abandon him because God abandoned him.

912
02:12:43,490 --> 02:12:46,110
Like, I was like, holy shit.

913
02:12:46,370 --> 02:12:51,110
So, you know, he might be like really a pain in the ass or like really boring, but like, I'm helping.

914
02:12:51,850 --> 02:12:55,910
I'm like, I'm thinking, can't abandon him.

915
02:12:58,630 --> 02:13:03,890
Like, Jesus Christ, I started to choke off strong.

916
02:13:04,710 --> 02:13:09,010
The punchline was, like, I can't abandon him because God abandoned him.

917
02:13:09,530 --> 02:13:12,790
Because I was just like, Jesus, fucking Christ.

918
02:13:13,210 --> 02:13:15,890
He's such a, yeah, he's like, yeah, sometimes he's such a buskill.

919
02:13:16,070 --> 02:13:17,870
Like, I was just like, oh my God.

920
02:13:18,190 --> 02:13:20,630
Yeah, he was like, it's my charity to the world.

921
02:13:24,920 --> 02:13:28,680
Yeah, I'm like, oh my God, it's crazy.

922
02:13:28,680 --> 02:14:26,060
and then um the other one was like oh my god okay this is so fucked up like you know like some comedians they're asked the audience and stuff by the way it's crazy because like we had some weird like not weird people we had some very controversial like um topics and stuff and then like one of the you know when they ask like guests and stuff like where are you from and then so like on the left side because I didn't want to sit in the front row because like I don't want them to ask me anything like I'm too scared I don't know what they're gonna say so I didn't sit in the front row because they were doing crowd work and stuff so like they're um they're like asking people around and stuff and like you don't know what you're gonna get so on the left side there was a guy from Albania and then on the right side there were three guys from Saudi Arabia so Obviously,

923
02:14:26,320 --> 02:14:27,920
people were like, oh, shit.

924
02:14:28,860 --> 02:14:33,100
There were three guys on the right that were from Saudi Arabia.

925
02:14:33,800 --> 02:14:36,540
And so it was very interesting.

926
02:14:37,020 --> 02:14:37,620
It was like...

927
02:14:39,780 --> 02:14:40,580
Oh, dear.

928
02:14:40,840 --> 02:14:42,980
And then, like, I remember the first comedian.

929
02:14:43,080 --> 02:14:44,540
They're like, okay, cool.

930
02:14:44,740 --> 02:14:46,480
And then, like, let's change topics.

931
02:14:46,860 --> 02:14:52,000
Like, oh, that's cool.

932
02:14:52,460 --> 02:14:55,160
All right, let's change topics real quick.

933
02:14:55,620 --> 02:15:01,140
They're like, we don't want to, they're like, oh yeah, I don't really, I don't know if, I don't know, I don't know if I'm gonna touch that right now.

934
02:15:03,220 --> 02:15:04,020
Yeah, yeah.

935
02:15:05,740 --> 02:15:08,280
He was not, he was not ready.

936
02:15:08,820 --> 02:15:40,620
And then, we're the same comedian, because like, um, uh, the same comedian, um, he was like, talking like, he was bald, and he was like, oh, I love hearing, like, stories about how someone, like, when they got when people get bald and then um and then he was like sir when was the uh when were you bald and then the guy was like at the day after 9 11 and i'm like what the fuck

937
02:15:46,190 --> 02:15:51,430

938
02:15:59,330 --> 02:17:06,190
nothing oh my god you're a never forget he's never gonna forget like we're in New York City by the way we were in New York City um so so like obviously we were like what the fuck like the computer's like what do I do like with that answer and and then and you know you struggle let's let's change topic guys oh my gosh and he's like like why like he was like hey i gotta know bro why where did you go all the day after that where were you and then the guy was like oh i was in australia i was like bro you were in australia that's how that's even corley you weren't even in your ex-city somewhere else he's like bro what What the fuck?

939
02:17:06,450 --> 02:17:08,910
I thought it was like a traumatic event.

940
02:17:09,190 --> 02:17:11,250
You were in fucking Australia?

941
02:17:11,950 --> 02:17:33,390
I was just like what the fuck bro had a punchline and everything That's actually Yeah, he was missing it was where the fuck is the connection like

942
02:17:36,430 --> 02:17:42,190
I got proud of you for trying to make an emergency landing strip.

943
02:17:42,870 --> 02:17:44,270
Golden, thank you for the super chat.

944
02:17:44,590 --> 02:17:44,810
Thank you.

945
02:17:45,190 --> 02:17:45,870
Thank you.

946
02:17:46,210 --> 02:17:47,050
He's scared.

947
02:17:47,490 --> 02:17:48,130
He was scared.

948
02:17:48,230 --> 02:17:49,910
He was like, I was in Australia.

949
02:17:52,230 --> 02:17:57,910
Just because he's Australian doesn't mean he don't bleed red, white, and blue.

950
02:17:58,710 --> 02:18:01,430
Guys, it is never forget, guys.

951
02:18:02,290 --> 02:18:03,290
Never forget.

952
02:18:07,630 --> 02:19:03,370
so yeah so that that's what happened i mean there was a lot of comedians but those were the two moments at the comedy club that like stuck out for me they were two really good moments i really wanted uh i really want to do i wanted to go to the show before because they had a writer from they had a writer from like um from a famous like show so I was like super curious like it was I was super curious and interested on like like it was oh it was like a writer from the Dave Chappelle show so um it wasn't Dave Chappelle it was a writer from that show so I was super curious because I was like oh maybe what kind of sets is he gonna do but it was all sold out and like apparently like there's standby tickets but you have to like You have to be like,

953
02:19:04,110 --> 02:19:07,470
you have to line up at that like early for it.

954
02:19:07,530 --> 02:19:18,210
Like you have to be at the door early and just like see if you can, see if you can like grab a ticket like on like on this like at the door.

955
02:19:18,530 --> 02:19:20,530
Like if it's because like you can reserve it.

956
02:19:21,510 --> 02:19:22,450
I don't remember the name.

957
02:19:22,530 --> 02:19:27,110
I just was looking at the description as to who's doing it.

958
02:19:27,250 --> 02:19:30,790
Because I don't really know a lot of like local stand-up comics.

959
02:19:31,350 --> 02:19:42,350
I just know like you know like the celebrities you know I don't know a lot of the writers and stuff I just know like you know the celebrity comics So and look how you guys were like oh, that's Neil Brennan.

960
02:19:42,630 --> 02:19:45,730
That's You were like that has to be him.

961
02:19:46,150 --> 02:19:50,150
So So yeah, unfortunately, I couldn't gravitate.

962
02:19:50,330 --> 02:20:06,010
I didn't want to wait in line, too Because I was like, you know, it's just like I don't want I don't like waiting in line Unless I have a reservation already because you can reserve it through email Um, and you don't have to, you don't have to, like, pay up front.

963
02:20:06,170 --> 02:20:10,430
You can just reserve it through your email and then just show up and then you pay later.

964
02:20:11,330 --> 02:20:19,430
Uh, so, so, like, obviously, like, it's very easy to reserve a ticket because you don't have to worry about it.

965
02:20:20,170 --> 02:20:22,310
Um, but yeah, no, it was a very interesting experience.

966
02:20:22,430 --> 02:20:26,750
I did a lot of stuff that, oh my gosh, I've been yapping for two hours.

967
02:20:26,910 --> 02:20:29,930
I swear to God, guys, like, I did so much in New York City.

968
02:20:31,350 --> 02:21:47,790
like experiencing things than like buying stuff or like sightseeing i went i was i went more for experiencing new york city rather than like like just sightseeing or like um like i want to do stuff you know like i mean to be fair watching like doing what going to a comedy club isn't really like it's like not really like it's still like watching something but it's different from sightseeing um but i really god i really wanted to go to um i really wanted to go to a showing of like a late night show or like saturday night live but i was reading up on it and it's so fucking competitive like because you can't you can't even get scalp tickets for it because it's um because it's like linked to your id so you can't even get scalp tickets for like saturday night day night live or like any like show like late show uh like up on it too um apparently like the only way you can even potentially um grab a ticket uh for like saturday night live or something is that you have to like line up um the day

969
02:21:47,790 --> 02:22:26,750
before and even then it's not guaranteed because it's more so of like how like like how many people would be able to get it you know you have to like do a line the day before to get the extra tickets god i need like a cough drop oh fuck oh wait i have oh my god i have one more oh my god i found one oh my god there's so i have like five more yeah so and i was reading up on it and people were like oh if you're lucky you might bump into like uh you might bump into there's like five more I found like a little path.

970
02:22:27,830 --> 02:22:34,450
Bump into like the musicians or like the workers at SNL and maybe they'll give you a ticket for free.

971
02:22:34,630 --> 02:22:35,770
But only if you're lucky.

972
02:22:37,610 --> 02:22:41,250
And it obviously, it depends on like who's hosting, you know?

973
02:22:41,870 --> 02:22:49,990
Because, you know, if it's like a big celebrity, a lot of people would be like, would be super competitive about going to SNL.

974
02:22:52,890 --> 02:22:54,290
And I was reading up on it.

975
02:22:55,190 --> 02:24:36,170
sold they sell it on charity auctions too so then i went to the fucking today i went to a fucking rabbit hole of like charity auctions and then i because they were linking i'll show you guys the website they're linking this website being like oh sometimes i put tickets on this website so I got into a deep rabbit hole like today about it and oh my god guys guys it's only 250 dollars for now for now but like guys I could own a Tony Hawk side skateboard I'm looking through all these I am guys what have I been on a Tony Hawk side skateboard deck oh my god I know what if I could guys I could get I could get a toria and then I saw this oh my god look no I saw this and I'm so mad because I'm so mad because I low-key was about to bid on this on a Hugh Jackman will record your personal outgoing voicemail I was like oh I can ask him to give me a shout and I looked at the terms and conditions and he was like this outgoing voicemail is for personal use only this message may not be used for any

976
02:24:36,170 --> 02:25:21,850
business and or the sale of any new commodity is not used by any means as an endorsement or any person and or bread because I couldn't do it I was like oh I can't he won't be able to shout me out I can't get it I can't get it you Jackman uh voice pack I mean I can't play it on stream because it's considered a commodity it's considered a business expense I don't want you Jackman to get to go after me guys I can't play it on stream they said it It has to be a personal voicemail.

977
02:25:24,190 --> 02:25:26,970
It would have been so funny.

978
02:25:27,410 --> 02:25:29,490
I was so close.

979
02:25:30,430 --> 02:25:32,170

980
02:25:32,370 --> 02:25:34,470
Also, the Grammy, there's a Grammy.

981
02:25:35,130 --> 02:25:37,490

02:25:37,490 --> 02:25:38,610
Guys, guys.

983
02:25:39,090 --> 02:25:45,570
Okay, if February 1st I, like, disappeared, you know where I am.

984
02:25:49,550 --> 02:25:56,770
If on February 1st, I'd suddenly disappear and I was like, I'm going to go on vacation.

985
02:25:57,450 --> 02:25:59,810

To be fair, I don't listen to music that much.

988
02:26:15,570 --> 02:26:17,890

989
02:26:18,230 --> 02:26:20,010

992
02:26:26,410 --> 02:26:31,430
Guys, what if Daft Punk makes a guest appearance at the Grammys?

993
02:26:31,930 --> 02:26:33,710

I went to the Wax Museum.

1023
02:30:54,860 --> 02:31:02,340
Um, um, I thought it was, okay, so there was this one area at the Wax Museum.

1024
02:31:03,260 --> 02:31:14,480
Um, okay, the Wax Museum freaked me out a lot, because like, I don't like animatronics, but like, I realized that my newest fear is the Wax Museum.

1025
02:31:14,920 --> 02:31:42,660
Um, so so there was there was i'll show you this is the this was the one area that freaked me the out because i was not okay and it was it was literally the cats area so this freaked me out Because they were too close.

1026
02:31:44,260 --> 02:31:47,020
Because like, they're not human at that point.

1027
02:31:48,640 --> 02:31:52,120
I actually could not.

1028
02:31:52,920 --> 02:31:55,980
Like, I was so fucking scared.

1029
02:31:56,080 --> 02:31:57,940
Like, I actually had goosebumps and everything.

1030
02:31:58,300 --> 02:32:00,380
I had to, I did not feel safe.

1031
02:32:00,560 --> 02:32:04,400
I did not feel safe whatsoever.

1032
02:32:05,060 --> 02:32:07,660
And I had to make sure that's because this actually, I was getting goosebumps.

1033
02:32:07,800 --> 02:32:09,140
And I was so scared.

1034
02:32:09,140 --> 02:33:08,340
they're actually gonna come alive and fucking eat me um so i had to wait until i see other people walking through for me no this is the musical cast it's not the live this is not the live action this is the musical version but i had to wait for like other people to walk in front of me for me to go past this area because i was legitimately so scared i was like i felt like it just it was just not okay and they were just too close like like they were way too close for my liking um but um there was so many uh cool wax feet oh my gosh wait i got we have to show you this picture i took so many photos because that is so it's so fucking stupid i took so i this was like i'm surprised like i did not get caught Mr. Abe?

1044
02:33:35,300 --> 02:34:29,860
but I also have these Steve Jobs I have I have these Steve Jobs as well historically before he went a little cuckoo and started sticking shit up his ass to cure cancer okay here's a little fun fact but you know how Steve Jobs got diagnosed with cancer well he wanted to try like was it holistic is it called holistic medic medicine he wanted to like try to like not do like um not use like actual like modern medicine to cure from cancer um so one of the ways he tried to like he tried to use like natural medic like natural medicine not like modern medicine So,

1045
02:34:30,320 --> 02:34:35,520
one of the, yeah, what's it called, homeopathic medicine?

1046
02:34:36,380 --> 02:34:43,560
So, one of the things he did was that he stuck some shit up his ass, hoping that it'll cure his cancer.

1047
02:34:44,120 --> 02:34:49,480
And he's dead now, so, I don't think it worked.

1048
02:34:50,520 --> 02:34:54,580
Yeah, he tried, like, essential oils and stuff like that.

1049
02:34:54,900 --> 02:35:16,920
Yeah, so, um, and then finally, the thing is, The craziest shit is, is that his cancer wasn't even, like, it wasn't terminal, like, because it got caught early, and, like, he had, I don't remember which cancer he got, but he had the one that wasn't terminal,

1050
02:35:17,400 --> 02:35:26,760
and, he could actually, like, he could actually, like, get, get, not cured, because he can't cure cancer, but, what's the word called?

1051
02:35:29,160 --> 02:36:20,540
of actually like uh i don't remember what it's called he could survive yeah there was a chance he had a high percentage to survive so then he was like i have time like so he was like i clearly have time because it was diagnosed super early it was an early stage um so so what he did was he stuck some stuff up his ass and it didn't work and then later on he later on after it progressed really far up he was like okay now i'll get chemo but it was already too late like it was already too late so yeah guys don't all i say is like if you have access to modern medicine

1052
02:36:24,040 --> 02:36:28,020
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't like gamble with your life.

1053
02:36:28,800 --> 02:36:31,440
Like, don't gamble your life like that.

1054
02:36:32,040 --> 02:36:36,040
Like, sticking things up your ass is not going to work for cancer.

1055
02:36:36,600 --> 02:36:37,680
It definitely wouldn't.

1056
02:36:38,540 --> 02:36:41,740
Yeah, listen to your doctor about that.

1057
02:36:43,220 --> 02:36:47,660
I'm sorry, Steve Jobs, but like, that's something we all have.

1058
02:36:47,820 --> 02:36:50,360
That's like something we have to learn in life.

1059
02:36:50,540 --> 02:36:52,340
Like, you already listened to us all.

1060
02:36:55,280 --> 02:38:23,760
that's that's a lesson to us all about some things that we shouldn't do uh okay and all right so okay this one's crazy okay so i need you guys to know about this one particular section and um it was okay so i was in the so you saw like me with abraham lincoln so that was the president hall so it was like there were all the presidents and stuff and all like world leaders and so like like fucking Gandhi was there too like not not like he's dead but you know what I'm talking about the wax museum so right after that you go outside the room and then it leads you to a subway entrance and I I need you guys to know about the subway entrance like and stuff let me make sure the reflection and stuff real fucking quick um because i just gotta be sure um okay so so like from the president hall to like by the way let me show you what the president let me show you like it was so like bright and everything And then,

1061
02:38:23,860 --> 02:38:33,360
and then right after the exit to the prison hub, we're like in, like, whatever the fuck this is.

1062
02:38:37,420 --> 02:38:44,640
So, I was just like, what the, by the way, the lights were flickering.

1063
02:38:46,540 --> 02:38:53,040
By the way, so I knew this was a.

1064
02:38:53,060 --> 02:39:19,840
bad this was a bad subway this was a fucking bad subway like they had the flickering lights and everything right after i got a presidential i got a photo with um with mr obama and joe biden like like okay look at the comparison because because i was just like oh my god i can be the president

1065
02:39:23,060 --> 02:40:47,580
guys this is like let me show you guys this is actually crazy the the the dual image of like how bright everything was and then and then like this was like the last photo i took in that hall in the in that room and then straight up we went got into the creepy fucking subway entrance so like look i'm like look at me i'm i'm now i'm president of the united states and then right after you go to the right and then and then it's the murder subways it's and then and then it's like the murder subway you turn right murder subway so so so i was like i was so scared because and then what did not help um was that was that as you go down the stairs because there's no other way you have to go this way as you go down the stairs on the right you see these posters they were horror movie posters so like it was like it and the conjuring and the nun so i was like oh this is a bad This is a very bad This is a very Very bad subway

1066
02:40:51,360 --> 02:42:07,860
So I do well as I was like Oh no This is the horror part of the wax museum So Do spooky freak toky So I waited in the stairs I waited Because the lights were flickering I was like why the fuck is the lights flickering so I waited I waited for for the stairs like for people to like start going down the stairs so I could like you know so I could also go down the stairs and then literally to the there's like there's like a left and a right so the left is for the pussies which is where I went and just and the right is for Warner Brothers horror like special horror exhibit so obviously I went to the left because I ain't gonna fuck with that like I'm no person that didn't go to the to the fucking murder scene to get murdered by I don't know Jason um so so I went to the left um and even then The left was so,

1067
02:42:07,920 --> 02:42:23,900
like, it led me to Ghostbusters, but like, not the, it was, but not, like, the classic Ghostbusters, it was the one where they gender-bent the Ghostbusters movie, but even then it was spooky, because there was, like, the slime guy, but, like, it was so loud,

1068
02:42:23,920 --> 02:42:29,440
and everything, so I was getting even spooked by the, the comedy, Ghostbusters.

1069
02:42:32,020 --> 02:42:36,980
But I could hear the noise of the horror attraction, because...

1070
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:39,340
Because you have to go through that.

1071
02:42:40,020 --> 02:42:40,440
To like.

1072
02:42:41,180 --> 02:42:42,080
Okay I'll show you guys.

1073
02:42:42,160 --> 02:42:43,560
Wait let me check if there's any reflections.

1074
02:42:43,740 --> 02:42:44,260
I'll show you guys.

1075
02:42:44,380 --> 02:42:46,780
So like there was like a hologram of the slime guy.

1076
02:42:46,940 --> 02:42:47,720
And then you can like.

1077
02:42:48,260 --> 02:42:50,300
You can like push a button or something.

1078
02:42:50,660 --> 02:42:52,120
To like capture him.

1079
02:42:52,240 --> 02:42:55,200
But it was so fucking loud.

1080
02:42:56,960 --> 02:43:00,940
And also like I hear like bits of the other attraction.

1081
02:43:01,040 --> 02:43:01,540
Like the horror.

1082
02:43:01,660 --> 02:43:02,780
Like so this is what it looks like.

1083
02:43:02,980 --> 02:43:04,420
So it's like the hologram.

1084
02:43:05,060 --> 02:43:06,700
The hologram of the slime.

1085
02:43:06,700 --> 02:43:15,280
And then you can like on the right side, there's a button That you can push to like suck the slimer into the thing.

1086
02:43:15,460 --> 02:43:20,200
But it was so loud and I hated it because I was just also standing there by myself.

1087
02:43:20,940 --> 02:43:23,360
So I was just, it was just me and the slimer.

1088
02:43:23,880 --> 02:43:26,300
And I was just like, I was so scared.

1089
02:43:26,620 --> 02:43:29,120
So I wanted, because I was like, what's downstairs?

1090
02:43:29,420 --> 02:43:30,800
I don't know what's downstairs.

1091
02:43:31,040 --> 02:43:34,400
I don't want to go into the other room by myself.

1092
02:43:36,700 --> 02:45:09,440
video of like what was in the okay madam uh warner bros horror i looked at the video of the the exhibit it was so bad it was i don't think i i definitely for sure would not have made it i i would have for sure not been okay if i went there because like their own room that you go through and I knew looking at the looking at the photos and the videos I would not have been okay I would have 100% been not okay if I had to go there I had to go through this I'll show you guys so I like cuz I looked out cuz I was so you know I was curious I was like oh I didn't go but i wanted to know so like basically like i would not have been okay if i saw this in person i would i would not have been also they have the it they have it in step penny wise too so so like yeah and they're all wax too yeah yeah no i would not have been okay they also have like penny wise too so look at that i would not this if if i couldn't do the cats i was struggling with the fucking cats i would have oh my god this would

1095
02:45:55,580 --> 02:45:57,000
But it was a...

1096
02:45:57,000 --> 02:46:02,200

02:47:53,330 --> 02:47:54,970
I went to Flavortown.

1121
02:47:55,150 --> 02:47:57,490
It was not Flavortown in Flavortown.

1122
02:47:57,610 --> 02:47:58,750
I got so sad.

1123
02:47:59,450 --> 02:48:01,930
Guy Fieri really did fell off.

1124
02:48:02,130 --> 02:48:09,910
I went to, there was a, there was like a Guy Fieri restaurant, fast food chain, and I was like, I gotta go.

1125
02:48:10,210 --> 02:48:12,670
I gotta go to Flavortown.

1126
02:48:13,050 --> 02:48:15,390
It was not Flavortown, unfortunately.

1127
02:48:15,550 --> 02:48:16,670
I was so sad.

1128
02:48:16,670 --> 02:48:20,910
I felt like, don't ruin my impression.

1129
02:48:21,690 --> 02:48:27,170
It was so, it was, unfortunately, I did not, I was not taken.

1130
02:48:27,190 --> 02:48:28,430
Look, there's Guy Fieri.

1131
02:48:29,210 --> 02:48:33,010
Unfortunately, I was not taken to Flavortown.

1132
02:48:33,470 --> 02:48:34,650
Look right here, see?

1133
02:48:34,890 --> 02:48:37,730
Wait, let me check if there's any reflection real quick.

1134
02:48:37,790 --> 02:48:40,090
Look, see, Flavortown.

1135
02:48:40,210 --> 02:48:41,670
I had to take a picture of that, though.

1136
02:48:42,290 --> 02:48:44,730
I didn't do Flavort.

1137
02:48:44,730 --> 02:48:46,650
It was like a fast food chain.

1138
02:48:46,670 --> 02:48:49,130
but it was still pretty bad.

1139
02:48:51,630 --> 02:48:54,870
It's Parasimdrome but Flavortown.

1140
02:48:56,430 --> 02:49:01,870
It made me so sad because I was so looking forward to Flavortown.

1141
02:49:03,430 --> 02:49:04,370
We didn't share rooms.

1142
02:49:04,510 --> 02:49:07,790
We got different rooms because Duby brought her aunt along.

1143
02:49:07,950 --> 02:49:12,910
Oh my god, there was this really cool exhibit where it was like for free too.

1144
02:49:13,810 --> 02:49:15,170
It was for free.

1145
02:49:15,730 --> 02:50:12,990
And it was basically like I don't remember what the place was called but they had like you can go in for free and they host like events and stuff um or like um they host like um like anime watching or like like it was like a little Japanese manga library thing where they had like little art galleries of like different types of manga uh art galleries so there was like Attack on Titan Ghost in a Shell Blue Lock and stuff like that and it was all free entry and it was so cool and they had like a um they had a giant diorama of the attack on titan um village and you know what that you know what i did for it that was the most riskiest photo i've ever taken honestly that had to be the most risky photo i've ever taken but you know what i had to do

1146
02:50:16,670 --> 02:50:21,490
That day, humanity had a grim reminder.

1147
02:50:24,050 --> 02:50:26,790
An attack on Dokey Bird.

1148
02:50:31,310 --> 02:50:33,030
Oh my god.

1149
02:50:33,410 --> 02:50:39,570
I had to take that photo and then it had to be done.

1150
02:50:39,970 --> 02:50:43,210
The Dokey Bird Titan right there.

1151
02:50:43,870 --> 02:50:45,970
How did you get your Titan there?

1152
02:50:46,830 --> 02:52:19,590

1168
02:55:35,290 --> 02:55:37,770
Because this is the one time you have to pay for extra for it.

1169
02:55:38,030 --> 02:55:39,230
So I was like, okay.

1170
02:55:39,330 --> 02:55:41,510
And she was like, yeah, it's an orgy.

1171
02:55:41,730 --> 02:55:45,450
And I was like, what?

1172
02:55:46,670 --> 02:55:50,750
And then, so then I was like, okay, I gotta see what this is.

1173
02:55:50,830 --> 02:55:52,450
Like, how do you make this up for it?

1174
02:55:52,550 --> 02:55:53,490
It was not.

1175
02:55:53,590 --> 02:55:55,150
By the way, it was.

1176
02:55:55,170 --> 02:55:55,790
was not.

1177
02:55:56,510 --> 02:55:58,690
It was an abstract film.

1178
02:55:59,310 --> 02:56:01,490
It was a fucking abstract, guys.

1179
02:56:01,650 --> 02:56:08,710
It was an abstract film, where, like, you know how, like, those crazy art films where you don't know what the fuck is going?

1180
02:56:08,850 --> 02:56:09,990
That's basically it.

1181
02:56:12,130 --> 02:56:15,010
You don't know what the fuck is going on.

1182
02:56:15,350 --> 02:56:17,790
I was just like, who am I watching?

1183
02:56:18,170 --> 02:56:20,190
But the 4D part was crazy.

1184
02:56:20,190 --> 02:56:21,250
Yeah, it's an art film.

1185
02:56:21,330 --> 02:56:56,690
It was literally an art film where like it felt like I was like it felt like I was on acid or some shit I felt clickbait I felt like I got clickbaited um by the way I was the only one sitting there too so it was so awkward so there was one moment where they showed a hole you know like it wasn't like you know like porn it was like it was just a hole like you know like just like it was artistic it was So and then it started like raining in that hole and then I was like,

1186
02:56:57,050 --> 02:57:03,410
wow, it's so wet And then water blew in my face the moment I said that out loud.

1187
02:57:03,710 --> 02:57:39,070
I was like, damn, that's a wet hole And then I got water blown in my face for the 4D effect as you go into the I was just like, oh my god, that's crazy oh my god and then when you're sitting on a chair because it's the 4d it's the 4d effect like it starts hitting you in the chair starts hitting you in the back as if you're getting fucking backshot And I'm like,

1188
02:57:39,610 --> 02:57:41,490
oh, no, no

1189
02:57:45,330 --> 02:57:57,790
No It's just like like the chair just starts hitting like like fucking hitting you in the back and I'm like, oh my god

1190
02:58:03,970 --> 02:58:11,830
Anyway, that was the worst five dollars I spent I was the worst I was like, let me off of this crazy ride.

1191
02:58:12,450 --> 02:58:17,550
Like, that's awful.

1192
02:58:18,390 --> 02:58:22,090
It was, anyway, I did not consent to that.

1193
02:58:22,930 --> 02:58:24,610
Um, what an experience.

1194
02:58:25,270 --> 02:58:28,990
So, um, the worst $5 I spent.

1195
02:58:29,570 --> 02:58:34,090
Um, it was, I was literally watching a French avant-garde abstract art film.

1196
02:58:34,630 --> 02:58:38,170
Like, you can't, like, I don't, one time, oh, it wasn't one part.

1197
02:58:38,190 --> 02:58:50,290
There was like this man with a hole in his chest and then a woman crawled out of a naked woman crawled out of his fucking chest And I'm like what the fuck this is not sexy.

1198
02:58:50,870 --> 02:58:57,210

Okay, you were turning the wheel.

1228
03:05:37,540 --> 03:05:39,100
It's literally a wheel inside it.

1229
03:05:39,120 --> 03:05:40,360
You were just turning it.

1230
03:05:40,640 --> 03:05:42,720
If you guys want to know, it wasn't that freaky.

1231
03:05:43,200 --> 03:05:46,100
The way it was presented was so fucking freaky.

1232
03:05:46,320 --> 03:05:47,560
But it was a free game.

1233
03:05:47,820 --> 03:05:49,580
And I was like, I paid $30.

1234
03:05:49,900 --> 03:05:52,780
Okay, the tickets were like $30 plus dollars.

1235
03:05:52,860 --> 03:05:56,220
And I was like, I paid $30 plus dollars to be in this museum.

1236
03:05:56,360 --> 03:05:59,040
I'm fucking playing these games because it's free.

1237
03:05:59,360 --> 03:06:02,760
Like it comes with my ticket.

1238
03:06:02,780 --> 03:06:07,160
it yeah yeah

1239
03:06:10,640 --> 03:07:28,640
no i got robbed i was so sad it's not the same it felt they fell off they they fell off also um we did go to a normal museum me and dubie went to a normal museum and it was the um it was like it was spy it's called spy scape or whatever basically it's a museum about spies and it was so cool because it talks about like um all the like spies around the world in history and they actually had like um the prop like actual like uh um what's the word uh artifacts from like back then like the small spies stuff and like spy gadgets like actual real ass spy gadgets and and yeah i took her to a fun museum that i didn't take her to the other one okay i went there by myself um yeah like not even replicas it's like actual like from during that era um so yeah they even have like the cars the clothes and um um like the gadgets and stuff and they're little like spy games and stuff so like there's like lie detectors like how to tell someone's lying and then there was like the laser like you can like

1240
03:07:28,640 --> 03:08:00,740
there's like a laser game where you have to try and push all these buttons without getting getting hit by the lasers it was so fucking cool i wish i took photos of it but i didn't but it was such a fucking it was such a cool museum and wait i want to see what photos did i take any photos from that um but um let me see um oh i saw okay i had to take a picture of that i thought it was so funny I took a picture of one of the exhibits because I thought it was so silly.

1241
03:08:01,540 --> 03:08:10,800
They even have like, they have like a security room too where you have to like try and see how good you are at monitoring people.

1242
03:08:11,220 --> 03:08:17,320
So it's an entire room and then around the room there were monitors, security cameras everywhere and monitors and stuff.

1243
03:08:17,640 --> 03:08:18,580
And then it's like a little game.

1244
03:08:18,700 --> 03:08:25,340
You're like on a phone and it's a little game you play where they're like, oh, which camera shows...

1245
03:08:26,620 --> 03:08:34,160
Which camera shows two men talking to each other at the dining table?

1246
03:08:34,240 --> 03:08:38,260
And you have to look around the camera and be like, oh, camera 33 or camera.

1247
03:08:38,300 --> 03:08:40,420
So it tests your surveillance skills.

1248
03:08:40,740 --> 03:08:42,420
Because that's what they do when you're surveilling.

1249
03:08:42,740 --> 03:08:45,520
They are able to monitor everything at once.

1250
03:08:45,760 --> 03:08:48,240
So they would be like, oh, which camera shows a guy juggling?

1251
03:08:48,480 --> 03:08:50,520
And then you're like, oh, we have to look around the room.

1252
03:08:50,700 --> 03:08:52,360
Like, oh, where is that camera?

1253
03:08:52,780 --> 03:08:56,360
So they're playing Five Nights at Freddy's.

1254
03:08:56,580 --> 03:08:59,360
Yeah, basically that, but with, like, it was a lot harder.

1255
03:08:59,540 --> 03:09:01,900
It was a lot harder than the actual game.

1256
03:09:02,620 --> 03:09:03,680
Um, let me take it fine then.

1257
03:09:03,820 --> 03:09:04,580
I took picture here.

1258
03:09:05,420 --> 03:09:06,020
Just saved it.

1259
03:09:06,060 --> 03:09:06,840
Where is it?

1260
03:09:08,020 --> 03:09:08,980
Where is it?

1261
03:09:09,640 --> 03:09:10,380
La la la.

1262
03:09:11,260 --> 03:09:12,000
I am Nord.

1263
03:09:12,060 --> 03:09:12,620
Oh, yeah, this one.

1264
03:09:12,700 --> 03:09:14,860
I wanted to show you guys this because I thought it was funny.

1265
03:09:17,500 --> 03:09:21,360
Um, basically, this is a real gear explosive rat.

1266
03:09:22,360 --> 03:09:22,720
I.

1267
03:09:26,580 --> 03:09:28,000
I saw this.

1268
03:09:28,200 --> 03:09:32,420
I was like, oh my god, explosive rat.

1269
03:09:35,900 --> 03:09:36,460
What?

1270
03:09:36,840 --> 03:09:39,180
It was a real spy gear.

1271
03:09:39,700 --> 03:09:42,400
It made a rat fucking explode.

1272
03:09:44,420 --> 03:09:45,540
That's hardcore.

1273
03:09:46,100 --> 03:09:47,700
I had to take a picture of that.

1274
03:09:48,040 --> 03:09:49,580
Also, like, there was like a personality.

1275
03:09:49,700 --> 03:09:50,360
It was so funny.

1276
03:09:50,680 --> 03:09:50,680
Okay.

1277
03:09:52,200 --> 03:09:54,720
There was a personality test.

1278
03:09:56,880 --> 03:09:58,560
And like an IQ.

1279
03:09:58,680 --> 03:10:03,580
Okay, so like in the ticket, there's like several boosts where you have to answer these questions.

1280
03:10:03,700 --> 03:10:04,700
So it's not just personality.

1281
03:10:05,040 --> 03:10:11,960
It's like personality, IQ, and I don't remember the other one.

1282
03:10:13,020 --> 03:10:14,340
And like a risk test.

1283
03:10:15,040 --> 03:10:15,340
Risk.

1284
03:10:15,700 --> 03:10:21,980
So when I got to the IQ test, I did two questions and then I gave up and just do like rat.

1285
03:10:22,500 --> 03:10:24,960
I just randomly answered.

1286
03:10:26,780 --> 03:10:27,780
Because I gave up.

1287
03:10:27,900 --> 03:10:29,040
I was like, I'm not thinking today.

1288
03:10:30,740 --> 03:10:32,560
And then do it be.

1289
03:10:32,680 --> 03:10:34,200
She was actually taking it seriously.

1290
03:10:34,520 --> 03:10:35,360
And answering them.

1291
03:10:35,380 --> 03:10:36,320
Like with her brain.

1292
03:10:36,460 --> 03:10:36,680
You know.

1293
03:10:36,960 --> 03:10:38,440
And I think she got like.

1294
03:10:39,260 --> 03:10:40,240
I think she got like.

1295
03:10:40,820 --> 03:10:42,200
9 out of 16.

1296
03:10:43,320 --> 03:10:45,960
And me out of pure random luck.

1297
03:10:46,500 --> 03:10:47,600
Got 6 out of.

1298
03:10:47,700 --> 03:10:48,260
I think it was.

1299
03:10:48,320 --> 03:10:48,440
No.

1300
03:10:48,500 --> 03:10:48,780
It was.

1301
03:10:49,200 --> 03:10:49,360
No.

1302
03:10:49,380 --> 03:10:49,700
I think.

1303
03:10:50,220 --> 03:10:50,620
Yeah.

1304
03:10:50,620 --> 03:10:52,440
I got 6 out of 16.

1305
03:10:52,580 --> 03:10:53,340
Of me just doing.

1306
03:10:53,460 --> 03:10:54,080
Boop, boop, boop.

1307
03:10:54,380 --> 03:10:54,480
Boop.

1308
03:10:55,960 --> 03:10:56,360

I don't know, I mean, I don't know, apparently I'm just, I'm just that good.

1311
03:12:10,220 --> 03:12:13,680
I did not, I'm the spot master.

1312
03:12:14,280 --> 03:12:19,060
Yeah, we are both, how does that make sense?

1313
03:12:20,780 --> 03:12:23,520
That's impressive and concerning.

1314
03:12:25,560 --> 03:13:01,780
so I got that that was fucking hilarious um but yeah no it was it was super cool this museum was actually like I said I did a lot of like things where I'm experiencing stuff like you know for the first time and just like going to museums and stuff I went through a lot of museum like the museum ice cream I got a lot of ice cream at the museum ice cream is so good um um museum ice cream the spot also I don't know if you guys ever seen those Twitter videos of like people were like pressing like you know you guys seen these Twitter videos where like people press a button There's like lights on the floor chasing you and you have to go to the next button and stuff like that You know that that's from this museum.

1315
03:13:01,960 --> 03:13:02,840
They had a section.

1316
03:13:02,960 --> 03:13:10,860
There's another section where it's called spy games And it's like a bunch of like light centered like okay, wait, I'll show you guys the video.

1317
03:13:10,940 --> 03:13:26,640
I've seen it It went viral on Twitter and I'll see um It went viral on Twitter and I've always wanted to play those games Um Uh Uh, but but I've always wanted to play it.

1318
03:13:26,720 --> 03:13:29,280
So I was like, oh my god, this is the place.

1319
03:13:29,340 --> 03:13:30,760
Yeah, with the boxes and lights.

1320
03:13:31,040 --> 03:13:31,820
Yeah, so wait.

1321
03:13:31,880 --> 03:13:32,960
Spy games.

1322
03:13:35,200 --> 03:13:37,740
I'm trying to say I can find a video for you guys.

1323
03:13:38,100 --> 03:13:39,300
Because it's so fun.

1324
03:13:39,460 --> 03:13:41,240
It's actually, it was so fun.

1325
03:13:41,540 --> 03:13:46,520
Like, I think it's, I'm trying to find the one with the Hazard one.

1326
03:13:46,920 --> 03:13:50,600
The really famous one where people were like running around.

1327
03:13:52,140 --> 03:13:54,700
Running around and pushing buttons and stuff.

1328
03:13:54,900 --> 03:13:57,340
Um, I'm trying to find it.

1329
03:14:01,480 --> 03:14:03,620
It was like, oh my god.

1330
03:14:03,740 --> 03:14:05,760
I want to find that exact video.

1331
03:14:06,580 --> 03:14:06,840
Hazard.

1332
03:14:07,280 --> 03:14:08,720
It was like called Hazard.

1333
03:14:09,240 --> 03:14:10,920
I think it was like Hazard something.

1334
03:14:13,820 --> 03:14:14,820
Hazard play?

1335
03:14:16,200 --> 03:14:17,020
I think.

1336
03:14:17,360 --> 03:14:18,120
Is that it?

1337
03:14:19,020 --> 03:14:20,200
How it works.

1338
03:14:20,580 --> 03:14:21,300
I'll just show you guys.

1339
03:14:21,360 --> 03:14:22,640
I'll just show you the normal video.

1340
03:14:23,220 --> 03:14:24,740
The social experience.

1341
03:14:24,900 --> 03:14:26,940
It's basically...

1342
03:14:26,940 --> 03:14:27,980
Okay, moving...

1343
03:14:27,980 --> 03:14:28,940
Okay, moving hazard.

1344
03:14:29,140 --> 03:14:30,280
Okay, moving...

1345
03:14:30,280 --> 03:14:31,320
I was so sad.

1346
03:14:31,360 --> 03:14:34,420
I wanted to play moving hazard because that was the one that's on Twitter.

1347
03:14:35,260 --> 03:14:36,560
Um, that was a spy.

1348
03:14:36,660 --> 03:14:39,340
That was the one I saw that was went viral on Twitter.

1349
03:14:39,820 --> 03:14:41,780
But like, literally they didn't have it today.

1350
03:14:42,020 --> 03:14:43,460
I think it was like that day.

1351
03:14:43,580 --> 03:14:45,200
I think it was closed down or something.

1352
03:14:46,120 --> 03:14:47,180
They said I can grab a TikTok.

1353
03:14:47,460 --> 03:14:48,340
Maybe I'll grab a TikTok.

1354
03:14:53,100 --> 03:14:53,500
Um...

1355
03:14:54,080 --> 03:14:54,880
Oh, this...

1356
03:14:54,900 --> 03:14:56,740
sure, yes, it's this one.

1357
03:14:58,580 --> 03:14:59,380
It's so cool.

1358
03:15:00,960 --> 03:15:05,120
So, we did this, like, me and Duby, and it was so fun.

1359
03:15:06,160 --> 03:15:10,140
Because, like, oh, my god, like, there was one we saw.

1360
03:15:10,200 --> 03:15:14,980
We saw two people doing this climbing thing and we're like, oh, that doesn't look so hard.

1361
03:15:17,560 --> 03:15:19,540
we're like, we're watching them.

1362
03:15:19,840 --> 03:16:44,300
They're doing this climbing game where you have to, like, climb um climb around i was like that looks so easy like that looks so it was not easy at all it was because they were like freezing through they were looping around and everything like we can't do that we could not we did not do it like oh my god how did they do this how did they climb around so easily yeah they were like they got like top 30 or some shit on the leader but I'm like that's easy we can do that it was not it was it was not it was surprisingly very difficult to climb but that was so fucking fun it was actually so yeah those people they know what they're doing they definitely go outside these guys definitely go outside we we were not okay um um but i didn't that was like one of the most fun experiences um definitely um um when we were like just like uh playing the spy games i i like that one um if you guys ever are new york city you should try that one try that game out it's honestly really fun um yeah professional

1364
03:17:47,440 --> 03:17:48,560
Which is understandable.

1365
03:17:49,740 --> 03:17:52,600
When I was there, I was the only one there.

1366
03:17:53,720 --> 03:17:56,040
No one else came into the restaurant.

1367
03:17:59,240 --> 03:18:00,760
She knew better.

1368
03:18:01,160 --> 03:18:03,840
No one else came into the, it was just me.

1369
03:18:04,320 --> 03:18:06,040

1378
03:21:50,100 --> 03:21:51,920
I didn't want to like put more attention on it on Twitter.

1379
03:21:52,160 --> 03:21:53,280
It was so fucking weird.

1380
03:21:53,680 --> 03:22:03,200
But like um so I didn't take a lot of the cosplay photos um because I asked like a staff to help me take photos of it um just because I got worried about doxing and stuff.

1381
03:22:03,480 --> 03:22:07,480
So obviously like they didn't tell me like Twitter handles and stuff like that.

1382
03:22:07,680 --> 03:23:21,300
So it was so weird because like one person got so angry that I didn't get I didn't credit the cosplayer um and like I waited 12 hours to at that time and like i've like shown cosplays before and like other i've seen other people show cosplays before um you know without like it's just like oh look at this cool thing also like i was also on vacation slash on a business trip so like i wasn't checking twitter that much but also when i posted that yeah there was this it was weird it's fucking weird because like um like you know i'm really busy i was like trying to enjoy my vacation so i wasn't looking at replies but it was crazy because the one thing they were really mad about is that they were like why did you wait 12 hours to credit and then like this one guy that was crashing out and then he made that reply at two in the morning it's so no and no not even two in them yeah so i woke up at six in the like five and like i woke up at five in the morning and i this and then I was just like

1383
03:23:21,300 --> 03:24:37,060
and then I put the credit because I saw that oh the cosplayer like said was like this is me and then so then I posted a credit because I woke up so I was like I was sleeping like I was just like in my head I was just like bro I'm not terminally online 24 I'm on a vacation technically like first it was a business trip but then it turned into a vacation I was like bro i was sleeping like i'm so confused like um so like i was just like bro what the fuck it's five in the morning too by the way by the way it's like it's good that i woke up early enough to put the credit also like when i posted that photo it was like 6 p.m for me it was 6 p.m but i had the the comedy club at 11 30 so i took a nap and then obviously i wasn't checking my twitter because um you know i was napping after i posted a photo and then you know i took a picture of the comedy seller and then they locked my phone up for another two out like i woke up from my nap and then i went to the comedy club that was at 11 30 i went

1384
03:24:37,060 --> 03:25:16,400
to 11 and then and then so so i got you know made us steal our phones so and then it was two in the morning and then i went home and went back to the hotel and i slept like you see the timeline so i was just like i it wasn't on purpose that like all that happened i was literally enjoying my vacation and and then and then yeah no they make you steal your phone at the comedy club because i don't want you to record in case they say some incredibly edgy jokes and they don't want to get canceled,

1385
03:25:16,540 --> 03:25:17,320
like the comedians.

1386
03:25:18,000 --> 03:25:22,440
So, yeah, and I felt so weird.

1387
03:25:22,580 --> 03:25:25,280
And they were like, why didn't you edit the tweet to fit?

1388
03:25:25,320 --> 03:25:31,560
And I was like, bro, I know you don't have Twitter blue because you can only edit a tweet within the first 30 minutes.

1389
03:25:31,780 --> 03:25:33,280
So I was just like, why are you?

1390
03:25:33,420 --> 03:25:35,280
I was like, why, what?

1391
03:25:35,500 --> 03:25:41,360
They're like, and then the cosplayer also got mad because I didn't edit the tweet to include her.

1392
03:25:41,760 --> 03:26:44,840
But I was like, I was like, like I'm sorry it's been 30 minutes I can delete the tweet I feel like you'd be mad if I delete the tweet because then it loses all the engagement so I was just like I can't win I was just like I can't win in this scenario like so I was just like I'm sorry I'm not sorry I did my best yeah it's a loose loose situation that's why i just like ignored it after that i like i was just letting them argue to themselves it was just and i continue tweeting about my vacation yeah it's just so awkward i like muted the tweet because i was like i can't win in this situation just gonna keep tweeting about my my time in new york city like yeah like people just want to be angry so at that What else am I going to do?

1393
03:26:47,320 --> 03:26:49,680
like, it ain't that deep, guys.

1394
03:26:49,820 --> 03:26:50,920
I was literally...

1395
03:26:50,920 --> 03:26:54,960
When all of this was happening, I was sleeping majority of the time.

1396
03:26:59,820 --> 03:27:01,220
Like, there was so...

1397
03:27:01,220 --> 03:27:03,840
The thing is, there was a lot of cosplay photos, too.

1398
03:27:04,200 --> 03:27:05,560
Um, that was taken.

1399
03:27:06,120 --> 03:27:08,020
So, uh...

1400
03:27:08,020 --> 03:27:10,620
Um, so it was like...

1401
03:27:10,620 --> 03:27:39,720
Um, so it was like, I didn't know, because like um also i've like posted i like seen like people you know post cosplays all the time and i didn't realize like at that time i didn't realize there's etiquette to uh make sure you have their twitter handles and everything because uh um so like so like i didn't realize now i know now i know because like you know i asked staff and be like oh hey can you get me the photos apparently the staff was told twit some twitter hands but like i guess like they forgot to tell me And at that time,

1402
03:27:39,780 --> 03:27:40,300
I didn't know.

1403
03:27:40,400 --> 03:27:41,220
So, like, now I do.

1404
03:27:41,640 --> 03:27:43,740
So, like, if I ever tweet about, like, cosplay photos.

1405
03:27:43,800 --> 03:27:45,560
So I don't have Twitter handles for these photos.

1406
03:27:45,660 --> 03:27:46,840
But I thought they were so cool.

1407
03:27:47,200 --> 03:27:49,040
But if you guys do know the cosplayers, just please.

1408
03:27:49,380 --> 03:27:50,660
Feel free to drop them down.

1409
03:27:50,760 --> 03:27:51,360
But I thought it...

1410
03:27:51,360 --> 03:27:52,140
Okay, look at this.

1411
03:27:52,180 --> 03:27:53,520
So I thought this was crazy.

1412
03:27:53,580 --> 03:27:54,540
This was, like, crossover.

1413
03:27:55,080 --> 03:27:56,600
Like, look at this cosplay.

1414
03:27:57,080 --> 03:27:57,740
Look at this.

1415
03:27:57,740 --> 03:27:58,640
This shit is cool.

1416
03:27:58,640 --> 03:28:00,660
Like, Wukon with Doctor Doom.

1417
03:28:00,660 --> 03:28:01,120
It was so...

1418
03:28:01,120 --> 03:28:01,900
They were, like, together.

1419
03:28:01,900 --> 03:28:05,060
They were, like, it was such a weird-ass combo.

1420
03:28:05,640 --> 03:28:07,240
Wukon with Doctor Doom.

1421
03:28:07,500 --> 03:28:09,120
Like, it was sick, though.

1422
03:28:09,200 --> 03:28:12,200
That cosplay was fucking sick.

1423
03:28:13,020 --> 03:28:13,500
Just funny.

1424
03:28:13,680 --> 03:28:15,500
The crossover we need.

1425
03:28:18,580 --> 03:28:21,500
Yeah, I was like, bro, that's insane.

1426
03:28:21,880 --> 03:28:24,660
And then a random baby in the background.

1427
03:28:27,220 --> 03:28:29,840
Now, I know they both go so hard.

1428
03:28:29,940 --> 03:28:30,680
It's cosplay.

1429
03:28:30,980 --> 03:28:32,460
And then there were hell divers.

1430
03:28:32,740 --> 03:28:33,280
Oh, my God.

1431
03:28:33,720 --> 03:28:34,440
That's so cool.

1432
03:28:34,480 --> 03:28:36,260
I saw some hell diver cosplays.

1433
03:28:36,320 --> 03:28:36,680
Look at this.

1434
03:28:36,740 --> 03:28:37,420
They're just chilling.

1435
03:28:37,780 --> 03:28:39,120
But, okay, they have their heads.

1436
03:28:39,200 --> 03:28:41,560
By the way, they didn't get to get, look at this though.

1437
03:28:42,220 --> 03:28:43,120
Oh my god.

1438
03:28:44,260 --> 03:28:45,160
Look at, oh my god.

1439
03:28:45,280 --> 03:28:48,320
I thought, like, the hell, there were so many hell diver cosplays.

1440
03:28:48,440 --> 03:28:49,400
They were, like, everywhere.

1441
03:28:49,780 --> 03:28:52,580
I saw so many hell divers for democracy.

1442
03:28:54,220 --> 03:28:56,380
Um, oh my god, this one was cute.

1443
03:28:56,420 --> 03:28:57,620
Okay, this one was badass.

1444
03:28:57,920 --> 03:28:58,460
I like this one.

1445
03:28:58,500 --> 03:28:59,100
Look at this one.

1446
03:28:59,220 --> 03:29:01,160
This one was fucking cool.

1447
03:29:01,500 --> 03:29:09,180
Like, the zombie captain of, I went to the, I went to the Marvel meetup and also the Marvel rival.

1448
03:29:09,200 --> 03:29:36,020
meetup to look at the cosplay um they were all so good like oh my i thought this one was insane the zombie captain america with the um oh they're doing cute right here uh with the with the regular captain america uh yeah is zombie yeah the zombie captain there was a there was a zombie Marvel meetup.

1449
03:29:36,200 --> 03:29:39,680
I was like, and surprisingly, there were so many cosplays.

1450
03:29:39,840 --> 03:29:45,960
I guess it's based off of the zombie show, the zombie cartoon that just came out on Disney Plus.

1451
03:29:46,340 --> 03:29:50,760
But I was so surprised there were a lot of cosplayers just dedicated to Marvel zombies.

1452
03:29:51,080 --> 03:29:53,780
Like, there was literally a meetup just for the zombies.

1453
03:29:53,960 --> 03:30:03,180
I didn't wait to look at it because I didn't want to, you know, I wanted to look at the other stuff at the convention like Duby and I.

1454
03:30:03,280 --> 03:30:56,840
Oh yeah, also Duby um she i found out that um she is obsessed with the winter soldier but it was so funny because we were talking about we were having our like ex-fujo moments like um because we were talking about our history of being ex-fujo's because we're both ex-fujo's and she's telling me that she learned about winter soldier by just reading fat bits of the winter she pieced together like winter soldier history and lore by just reading the fan fictions of winter soldier and I thought it was so because I was telling her how I used to did that too because I told you guys um I pieced together one piece like the lore of one piece and what the characters are from reading the fanfics of one piece of a one piece pairing and but because I didn't even know what they did.

1455
03:30:56,900 --> 03:30:57,640
I didn't know what they did.

1456
03:30:57,720 --> 03:31:00,300
I didn't know what their history or anything, but I really like the two characters.

1457
03:31:00,700 --> 03:31:10,760
And then I would read fanfics about those two characters and then piece together their character and like the lore and everything from just reading the fanfics.

1458
03:31:10,980 --> 03:31:13,720
And then Duby was like, oh, that's just like me with Winter Soldier.

1459
03:31:14,260 --> 03:31:21,180
And so like, that's how that's how I learned it.

1460
03:31:21,580 --> 03:31:29,060
But but yeah, she's like really into I think I heard her talking about Um, she's really into Winter Soldier right now.

1461
03:31:29,220 --> 03:31:38,020
I even, like, I helped her take photos of, like, all the Bucky's I saw at, uh, uh, all the Bucky's I saw and took photos for her.

1462
03:31:38,020 --> 03:31:41,660
Uh, hear me out.

1463
03:31:45,220 --> 03:31:49,360
So I thought, I thought that was, I thought that was really funny.

1464
03:31:51,920 --> 03:31:54,740
Um, uh, Gina, thank you for the five.

1465
03:31:56,440 --> 03:31:57,040
Thank you.

1466
03:31:57,140 --> 03:31:57,520
No, no.

1467
03:31:57,800 --> 03:31:59,680
We're both ex-Fujos, guys.

1468
03:31:59,900 --> 03:32:03,540
We're both ex-Fujos, guys.

1469
03:32:04,940 --> 03:32:05,700
What else?

1470
03:32:06,220 --> 03:32:07,560
I want to show you.

1471
03:32:10,560 --> 03:32:13,700
I mean, I took a lot of photos, but I don't know which one I want.

1472
03:32:13,800 --> 03:32:14,780
Oh, wait, God, here.

1473
03:32:15,180 --> 03:32:15,740
I got...

1474
03:32:15,740 --> 03:32:17,420
Wait, I got to make sure there's no reflection.

1475
03:32:17,500 --> 03:32:18,840
I always have to, like, be sure.

1476
03:32:19,340 --> 03:32:21,440
Because I took the photos without, like, you know.

1477
03:32:23,440 --> 03:32:24,660
Checking things fully.

1478
03:32:26,440 --> 03:32:28,180
I'll check it later.

1479
03:32:28,600 --> 03:32:29,660
Today is later.

1480
03:32:32,040 --> 03:32:33,600
Right now is later.

1481
03:32:35,240 --> 03:32:36,620
Oh, there's so many photos.

1482
03:32:36,780 --> 03:32:37,140
I don't know which.

1483
03:32:37,220 --> 03:32:39,220
Oh my god, I took a photo with Beyonce.

1484
03:32:39,600 --> 03:32:40,620
You guys want to see that?

1485
03:32:44,960 --> 03:32:47,720

1486
03:32:49,040 --> 03:32:49,640

1488
03:32:55,820 --> 03:32:56,420
Okay.

03:32:56,440 --> 03:32:58,740
Where is Beyonce?

1490
03:33:00,140 --> 03:33:01,120
Where is the queen?

1491
03:33:02,820 --> 03:33:03,760
Look at this, guys.

1492
03:33:07,220 --> 03:33:08,860
It's me and Beyonce.

1493
03:33:13,680 --> 03:33:16,220
I'm in the perfect position.

1494
03:33:16,660 --> 03:33:18,580
Oh, whip Beyonce.

1495
03:33:23,720 --> 03:33:24,780
There's a photo.

1496
03:33:24,820 --> 03:33:28,360
I do have a photo where it's from the bottom.

1497
03:33:28,380 --> 03:33:31,100
bottom-up perspective, but I don't think that's safe.

1498
03:33:31,480 --> 03:33:35,060
I mean, it is safe, but then I don't want you guys to judge me.

1499
03:33:35,600 --> 03:33:38,960
I don't, it is safe, but I just, I don't know.

1500
03:33:39,060 --> 03:33:40,680
I just, I feel a little embarrassed.

1501
03:33:41,080 --> 03:33:43,980
I feel a little embarrassed with that camera.

1502
03:33:44,280 --> 03:33:48,900
I thought it would be funny, but then I looked at the photo and I was like, oh, I look like a creep.

1503
03:33:49,420 --> 03:33:54,840
I, I was like, oh, I look like a creep.

1504
03:33:55,000 --> 03:33:56,020
Maybe I shouldn't.

1505
03:33:56,440 --> 03:33:58,360
Maybe I also look.

1506
03:33:58,380 --> 03:34:09,440
Oh my god, I got a photo with Nicholas Cage No shame Look at that The bees, not the bees

So they gifted us these pins and stuff.

1544
03:37:46,170 --> 03:37:47,750
There's a lot.

1545
03:37:49,250 --> 03:37:49,950
Let's see.

1546
03:37:50,870 --> 03:37:53,190
Looking at what else I did.

1547
03:37:53,670 --> 03:38:24,990

1548
03:38:25,150 --> 03:38:27,230
They're so oblivious to the real world.

1549
03:38:31,470 --> 03:38:36,770
I was just like, man, they don't know how... They look so happy.

1550
03:38:37,050 --> 03:38:40,270
They were living their best life right now.

1551
03:38:42,510 --> 03:38:45,990
Oh, they had a Dr. Eggman cosplay at comic.

1552
03:38:46,090 --> 03:38:48,010
I'm so sad I didn't take a picture of it.

1553
03:38:48,330 --> 03:38:49,410
It was so good.

1554
03:38:49,550 --> 03:38:53,830
The doctor... It's like the... It was like the Jim Carrey Dr. Eggman.

1555
03:38:54,390 --> 03:39:06,710
He looked just like, he looked just like the movie The Jim Carrey, Dr. Eggman, too It looked just like him And I wish I took a photo Instead I took a little creep shot So I'm not going to show it

Guys, I can't.

1560
03:39:31,470 --> 03:39:39,230
Also, also, I realized, you know how like I tweeted that cosplay photo and it went out of my circle?

1561
03:39:43,270 --> 03:39:47,050
Because everyone says that in Marvel Rivals and it went out of my circle.

1562
03:39:47,490 --> 03:39:53,750
So I can't say that anymore because I was like, no, it's supposed to be supposed to have Marvel Rivals me.

1563
03:39:54,010 --> 03:40:25,530

I'm a changed person now.

1570
03:40:35,330 --> 03:40:37,710
I need to get rid of the mold first before I can say.

1571
03:40:37,990 --> 03:40:38,350
Oh, yeah.

1572
03:40:38,490 --> 03:40:41,550
I was asking Duby if she wanted to do.

1573
03:40:42,630 --> 03:40:45,590
I thought it was a Marvel Rivals meme because it was.

1574
03:40:45,890 --> 03:40:47,470
I thought it was a Marvel Rivals.

1575
03:40:47,490 --> 03:40:48,770
I learned at that day.

1576
03:40:48,850 --> 03:40:52,070
At that day, I learned.

1577
03:40:52,170 --> 03:40:56,110
I keep learning it, too, because I was like, yeah, I keep relearning it.

1578
03:40:56,490 --> 03:41:01,690
This time, I learned, for real, that day that it's not just the Marvel Rivals meme anymore.

1579
03:41:08,870 --> 03:41:21,730
Anyway, I wanted to do a, in a skate room, because there was a really cool skate room in New York, but, like, Duby was, like, not into it, because another fun fact from Duby.

03:44:18,180 --> 03:44:22,280
It's not even like separate models in like one area.

1588
03:44:22,360 --> 03:44:23,800
It's one giant.

1589
03:44:23,820 --> 03:44:54,120
ass model like it's crazy so that's why people were like oh why is the why is like the building so fucking flat because it's one model like it's not it's literally just one giant like that's crazy it's that's actually it's insane like i i saw that and i'm like there's no fucking way Like,

1590
03:44:54,160 --> 03:44:56,200
there's no fucking way.

1591
03:44:56,580 --> 03:45:01,260
It's just, it's just, I can't even, like, defend it.

1592
03:45:01,560 --> 03:45:03,960
That's actually insane to think about.

1593
03:45:07,980 --> 03:45:08,540
Yeah.

1594
03:45:09,140 --> 03:45:11,200
I, yeah.

1595
03:45:13,560 --> 03:45:16,640
So, I thought that was really, really funny.

1596
03:45:17,440 --> 03:45:19,940
I, um, that seems hard.

1597
03:45:20,060 --> 03:45:20,820
I don't know.

1598
03:45:20,960 --> 03:45:23,800
I don't, like, I don't know how to feel.

1599
03:45:23,820 --> 03:45:46,980
feel like I don't I don't even know if it's easier at that point to model an entire city uh like is that even easier like I don't know I like I just like the craziest shit you can do just like make an entire city but it's just one one giant ass model I I don't know I I know definitely not

1600
03:45:51,080 --> 03:47:06,040
yeah if you want to edit the building you have to edit the entire model i know that's like wow and i really wanted to talk about i wanted to talk about the star me shit and then because like honestly that's peak that's peak pokemon right there like i think that has to be my favorite newest pokemon design that they've ever done and they just gave him legs but it's so good and he's he sent a message and that message was like the was so clear like it's just it's just like keep he made an impression on all of us and it's memorable all the other ones i saw the other ones and i was like it's not as memorable as fucking uh the running star me the star like he looks like a goddamn titan running at you like he just it's just he sent a message and it was it was loud and clear like it was so memorable um honestly the best mega evolution they've ever done um um oh my god I've been talking for four hours I miss streaming with you guys chat I really didn't miss streaming um it was a nice vacation um

1601
03:47:06,040 --> 03:47:16,500
I feel a lot refreshed now um I mean it was a business trip turned into a vacation huge shout out to Capcom again for inviting me um to Comic-Con and checking everything out.

1602
03:47:16,700 --> 03:47:24,500
I really wanted to go to the panels but I felt like I don't know I didn't I felt like it felt like I would like lose a lot of my time checking out the panels too.

1603
03:47:24,740 --> 03:47:36,220
I was going to try one of the panels because I wanted to check out the adventure time the Fiona um and cake panel um but I felt like I felt like I would just be too much of it.

1604
03:47:36,240 --> 03:48:38,220
I would have to wait in line way and like and then like doesn't even mean guarantee i'd get seats because people would be camping that fucking uh so uh i didn't do any in the panels but i mean i even only had time to leave half of comic-con too um so uh oh yeah the new onimusha game it's basically the the fighting wise felt like i would say like i never played securo but it felt like it felt souls like the fighting because the parry is a lot easier obviously because like the older games were a long time ago but um the current like like the the the fighting mechanic felt like there's like blocking and parries and stuff like that and it felt like um it felt very soul's leg yeah so um so like that's how I felt like when I was playing the game um I don't never played Sekiro but I assume that's how Sekiro is supposed to feel like I I never played it but I assume because It felt like it felt very soul's like with a dot.

1605
03:48:38,320 --> 03:48:43,280
There's like dodging like the dodging mechanic There's a dodging there's like parry and there's block too.

1606
03:48:43,660 --> 03:48:50,260
So um, but anyway Um, it's good to be back tomorrow.

1607
03:48:50,760 --> 03:48:51,800
Maybe I'll play silk song.

1608
03:48:51,920 --> 03:48:55,540

1609
03:48:55,940 --> 03:48:58,000
Um, but maybe tomorrow I'll do silk song.

1610
03:48:58,780 --> 03:50:03,920
Um, but Saturday I do have a sponsored pub g. Um, I think it's called blind spot I think that's the new pub g game i got guys how do i get rid of guys do i do i do i pour water in the bowl first before i start scraping the mold out can i put the mold in the sink or is that bad guys do i scrape it in a trash bag or i can't i can't throw it away that's the thing because i do i rinse it do i rinse it while scrape it no the thing is i have to give it back to the clean like the the chef i can't throw it away or they'll charge me like a lot uh they actually would charge me a lot if i um if i if i if i don't return everything so i rather just clean it um hot water and scrape it in a trash bag okay um and then i'll put and then i'll put it in the dishwasher again after it uh scrape it and Then wash it.

1611
03:50:06,060 --> 03:50:07,680
