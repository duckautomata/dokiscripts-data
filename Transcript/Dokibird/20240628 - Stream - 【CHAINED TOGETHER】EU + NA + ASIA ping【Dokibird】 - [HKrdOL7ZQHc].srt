1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,300
Wait, what?

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,720
Why is my mic so low?

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,880
Your mic is actually not low.

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:09,820
Do not make it loud.

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,400
No, I'm on my OBS.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,320
I'm on OBS.

7
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,520
It's like low on my OBS.

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,580
It's like at the yellow.

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,320
It shouldn't be at the yellows.

10
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:20,620
That's the thing.

11
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:21,760
The yellow?

12
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,560
It was supposed to be at red, so they died?

13
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,600
Yeah, no, it's supposed to be at the red.

14
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:26,180
Okay.

15
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,580
Wait, really?

16
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:28,260
Yeah.

17
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,760
Yeah, it should be like touching the red.

18
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,480
So it's like...

19
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,280
No?

20
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,820
Wait, actually, let me see.

21
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,380
Yeah, it's so low.

22
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,780
It's almost at the green.

23
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,160
I'd be always at the reds.

24
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,220
That's so weird.

25
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,520
The red is the bad one.

26
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:43,740
No, it's good.

27
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,500
It's good when you're the streamer.

28
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,040
It's...

29
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,800
Guys, we're just a little messy at the moment.

30
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:52,680
You're trying to kill all...

31
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,160
Wait, my sound...

32
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,340
You're trying to kill someone?

33
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,180
Wait, I'm going to tell Ditto to hop right in.

34
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:00,700
We need to hop in her channel.

35
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:01,080
Wait, we need to hop in her channel?

36
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,200
Because her channel is a live channel.

37
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,740
Oh, wait, are we not the live?

38
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,000
Oh, okay.

39
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,540
Yeah, we're in general.

40
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,120
Wait, where's my disc green?

41
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:07,800
Where did it go?

42
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,260
I'm a mess right now, guys.

43
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:10,640
I'm...

44
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,440
I'm so tired.

45
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:15,220
You're a mess.

46
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:16,580
You're tired.

47
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,580
It's 2 a.m.

48
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,140
I'm tired.

49
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,100
I'm tired.

50
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,620
She's tired, guys, but it's 2 a.m.

51
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:24,760
here.

52
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:24,860
Okay, okay, okay.

53
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:25,580
Let's start your idea.

54
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,780
How was I supposed to know it's in Japanese?

55
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,240
I'm tired.

56
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,700
Please, I can't read that.

57
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,840
I didn't know that means live.

58
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,380
Okay, I'm hopping in.

59
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:35,260
Hello?

60
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,060
Oh, hello.

61
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:39,680
Hello.

62
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:40,980
Wait, where's RP?

63
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,060
RPR's not hopping.

64
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:42,960
Okay, RPR.

65
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,240
Okay.

66
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,560
RPR's late.

67
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:46,780
Yeah, RPR's late.

68
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,500
He's late.

69
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,600
What is he doing?

70
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:49,980
He's late.

71
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,100
Yeah, what are you doing?

72
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,400
You're late.

73
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,340
He's in game.

74
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,020
What's up, guys?

75
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,100
Yeah, and you're wasting our time.

76
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,060
He's in game.

77
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:57,860
Nobody's in here.

78
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:58,220
Are you down?

79
00:01:58,820 --> 00:01:59,900
Hey, Dito.

80
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,280
Hey, what's up, Dito?

81
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,760
Why were you late?

82
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,820
We were waiting for you.

83
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,440
I just needed a moment of silence.

84
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,760
You need a moment of silence?

85
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:09,480
Why?

86
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,160
Why?

87
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,580
I just need to breathe in...

88
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,440
Breathe out...

89
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,980
Okay, so this game is all about coordination.

90
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,160
But like, we have...

91
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,900
We have... Each person is from a different region.

92
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,740
So...

93
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,100
I don't think that's gonna be the problem here.

94
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,460
Just gonna point that out real quick.

95
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,120
How is that not the problem?

96
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,500
How is that not the problem?

97
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,560
I don't think ping is gonna be our biggest issue in this poll.

98
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,680
No, 100% ping is gonna be an issue.

99
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,400
What do you mean?

100
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:42,900
Yeah.

101
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,260
It's definitely gonna be an issue.

102
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,120
Because... What server?

103
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,180
What server is this?

104
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,260
NA.

105
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,320
It's NA.

106
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,120
America.

107
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,820
Yeah, yeah, so... I wanna say...

108
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:55,400
Um...

109
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,060
We're playing with no checkpoints, apparently.

110
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,720
Yeah, no, I said maybe we should do baby mode.

111
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,620
And then like, our PO was like, no, because chat's gonna bully us.

112
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,160
If we play baby mode.

113
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,100
So...

114
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,240
Was I wrong?

115
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,500
I'm saying...

116
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,500
I'm being a nasty girl.

117
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:18,200
I'm saying that like... I feel like we might need baby mode with the ping we have.

118
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,160
So...

119
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,460
Alright, so are you guys... Are you guys excited?

120
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,980
Have you guys played this yet?

121
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:25,480
I have.

122
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:25,880
Yeah.

123
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,340
No, this first time.

124
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,960
No, first time, first time.

125
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,320
Oh, okay.

126
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:29,760
So...

127
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,120
I am so happy that you guys are gonna be the first people I'm gonna play this game with.

128
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,840
I'm so excited to get this going.

129
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,280
I played with actually competent people, so I know what it was like to like...

130
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,960
You know, actually progress before I play with you guys.

131
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,320
So...

132
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:43,780
Okay, good.

133
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,360
Pause.

134
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,200
Pause.

135
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,560
What do you mean by actually competent people?

136
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,300
Who are these competent people compared to me?

137
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,580
People who live in NA.

138
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,080
No, even the sound guy was like, did you turn yourself down?

139
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,020
You sound so quiet.

140
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,460
I know, sound guy.

141
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,260
There's something weird with my mic right now.

142
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:04,980
I don't know why.

143
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,060
I sound like more quiet than usual.

144
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,860
Oh, I should've... I don't know why.

145
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,700
It's so weird.

146
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,600
My shit is like fucked up for some reason.

147
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,600
I'm putting myself at a hundred.

148
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:18,640
Maybe that'll be better.

149
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,940
I'm putting myself at a hundred.

150
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:51,280
I'm not supposed to be in the reds.

151
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:51,920
You're not supposed to be in the reds.

152
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:52,660
Yes you are!

153
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:53,760
When you're streaming!

154
00:04:54,020 --> 00:05:01,140
When you're the streamer, when you're the main character of your stream, you're supposed to be at the red and everybody else is supposed to be at the yellows.

155
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,960
Who made this rule?

156
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,780
Who made this rule?

157
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,700
Streamers made the rules!

158
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,560
I pushed myself up a little bit.

159
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,160
Maybe I should restart my... my... my GoXLR.

160
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,060
Give me a sec guys.

161
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,300
I'm gonna restart my GoXLR real quick.

162
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,760
We are so prepared for this callout.

163
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,620
What do you mean?

164
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,220
Look!

165
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,380
I'm making sure...

166
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,720
It's easy!

167
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,100
My god I can't hear you!

168
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,380
Where did you go?

169
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,660
You walked away from the mic?

170
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,200
This game is not that hard.

171
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:38,420
Okay.

172
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,960
Somebody's coping right now.

173
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:44,980
Wait okay.

174
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,020
Yeah no it's easy.

175
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,120
This game is easy by the way.

176
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,540
Okay so I'm gonna put myself at 100 because apparently...

177
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,740
I don't know what's going on with my GoXLR.

178
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,360
Okay are you guys ready?

179
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:52,700
Yes.

180
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,600
Are you guys... you guys are ready right?

181
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:57,700
Yes.

182
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:57,960
Yes.

183
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:58,200
Okay.

184
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,240
I'm playing.

185
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,240
I'm prepared yeah.

186
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,180
Let's get this pain train on.

187
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:02,380
Is this hard?

188

You carry us.

206
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:29,560
Carry us.

207
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,300

208
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,000

00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,000
Also I hope...

210
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,420
I was... I was... I was dead here.

211
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,860
I'm following you guys.

212
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,240
Okay me too.

213
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,680
She's... she's useless.

214
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,880
We didn't even start man.

215
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,680
We're wasting time.

216
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,180
Let's go guys.

217
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,740
Look we have a timer.

218
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,260
Top left.

219
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,300
We're already 40 seconds in.

220
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:47,820
Oh it doesn't matter.

221
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,140
The timer doesn't matter.

222
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,100
No we're speed running.

223
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,820
We're speed running.

224
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,240
Let's go.

225
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:51,580
Come on.

226
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,940
We're gonna get speed run.

227
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,520
Why do we need a speed run?

228
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,980
We have to work together.

229
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,160
What is this?

230
00:06:59,240 --> 00:06:59,580
What is this?

231
00:06:59,580 --> 00:06:59,680
What is this?

232
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,200
Stop pulling.

233
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,440
It's like only up for multiplayer.

234
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:04,920
That's basically it.

235
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,260
Wait D2 you don't even know what the game is?

236
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,740
It's only up.

237
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,720
It's only up multiplayer.

238
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,340
Yeah.

239
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,600
Okay okay.

240
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,000
Okay it's easy because I clear only up.

241
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,240
Obviously we're not gonna beat the game.

242
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,600
So like what's the goal?

243
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,080
What's the... alright.

00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,480
You pull it up.

247
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,660
How do I pull it up from there?

248
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,480
Jump.

249
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:28,980
Alright.

253
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,420
Yeah okay guys.

254
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,820
Let me crack my knuckles.

255
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,700
Alright so we have to jump here.

256
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,640

260
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,520
Okay you guys are not ready.

261
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,120
You guys are not ready.

262
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,680
You're killing us.

263
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,180
You're killing us.

264
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,560
I said are you guys ready?

265
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,680

Jump.

267
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,540
Jump.

268
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,180
What are you guys doing?

269
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,080
What the fuck?

270
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,580
Together.

271
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:56,740
Together.

272
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,380
Jump.

273
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,480
Pause.

274
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,060
Pause.

275
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,600
Pause.

276
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:00,420
Pause.

277
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,100
Pause.

278
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:02,380
Okay.

279
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,980
Let's talk about strategy.

280
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,300
Let's talk about strategy right here.

281
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,580
You don't need to count.

282
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,740
You just jump.

283
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,340
Look at how big this platform is.

284
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,040
No no no no no no.

285
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:13,280
We're gonna do one, two, three jump every single time.

286
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,200
This is the platform.

287
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:14,800
It's so big.

288
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,200
We don't need it.

289
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,620
One, two, three jump.

290
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,480
Okay.

291
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,260
You are all stupid.

292
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:20,760
Okay.

293
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:21,340
Okay.

294
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:21,480
Okay.

295
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:21,900
Okay.

296
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,600
We're not gonna do this.

297
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,480
You jump on two.

298
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,860
You jump on two.

299
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,120

00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,340
Oh okay.

304
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,080
Ditto I said you jump on two.

305
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,300

00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,880
Alright ready.

307
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,180
One, two, three jump.

308
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,660
Why do we need jump one two three for this?

309
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,660
One, two, three jump.

310
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,200
Oh my god.

311
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:43,820
Okay.

312
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,080
Okay.

313
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:44,340
Okay.

00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,180
One, two, three jump.

00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:47,800
Okay.

Okay.

317
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:48,500
Okay.

318
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:48,720
Okay.

319
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:48,760
Okay.

320
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:48,860
Okay.

321
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,400
Ditto you're always the one behind.

322
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:50,800
No.

323
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,360
I mean.

324
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,260

325
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,100
Feeling!

326
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,980
I have like...

327
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,460
You have the splines out of the three of us!

328
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,360
It's a kindergarten, we didn't start.

329
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,800
I bet you when I look behind, Ditto's gonna be the one in the very back.

330
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,740
If you fall down and you pull me down with you, I will...

331
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:11,780
Ditto,

332
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,260
get over here!

333
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,020
I just wanted to know what...

334
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,460
Okay, we go right, we go right, we go right!

335
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,140
We go right, we go right!

336
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,200
Give me a good reason to go right.

337
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:29,560
Okay.

338
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,000
Jump!

339
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,940
One, two, three, jump!

340
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,800
Because it's literally faster!

341
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,140
If I touch this, do we die?

342
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,520
No, you don't die in this game.

343
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,440
You don't die in this game.

344
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,180
So why is the laser here?

345
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,860
It knocks you off.

346
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,960
I got this, I got this.

347
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:47,700
Follow me, follow me.

348
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,900
No, it's on the right!

349
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,100
You see that fucking Bowser shit?

350
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,940
The Super Mario shit!

351
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,260
It's the same shit if you go left or right!

352
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,360
What are you on about?

353
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,580
It's closer to go this way!

354
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,540
Which way?

355
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,360
What is this?

356
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,060
It's Super Mario!

357
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,000
It's Mario!

358
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,500
Okay, okay.

359
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,000
You know what?

360
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,920
You can IGL.

361
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,280
No, no, I don't want to IGL.

362
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,200
I need to turn down my Discord.

363
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,040
No, no, it's okay.

364
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:14,760
No, no, no, no.

365
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,180
I need to turn down my Discord anyway.

366
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,440
Alright, I'm ready.

367
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,260
As the oldest person here, you...

368
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,080
You have to IGL.

369
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,500
I'm 12.

370
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,500
No, 13.

371
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:25,600
Fuck!

372
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,000
Is this Dr. Disrespect?

373
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,520
Oh my god!

374
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,240
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

375
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,080
What are you doing?

376
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:34,560
No, no, no!

377
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,980
Pull me, pull me, pull me!

378
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:39,980
Okay.

379
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,740
What are you doing?

380
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,740
Wait, wait!

381
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,460
Second bounce we go, okay?

382
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,120
Second bounce we go to the other side.

383
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,360
This is the second bounce.

384
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,300
This is the second bounce.

385
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,440
The second bounce.

386
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,500
Okay, here we go.

387
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,520
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

388
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,100
The second bounce right here.

389
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,240
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

390
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,440
Wow, great IGLing.

391
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,980
All I'm saying is I have yet to fail as an IGL.

392
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,860
Chat, I'm not banned.

393
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:15,800
I'm not banned.

394
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,320
I hope I get banned.

395
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:20,220
Oh my god, he admitted he was 12 years old.

396
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,100
He's not allowed on Twitch.

397
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,520
Report him!

398
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,820
I literally have my government information.

399
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,360
They have my government information.

400
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,800
Okay, right side, right side, right side.

401
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,200
Oh my god.

402
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,940
Right side, right side, right side.

403
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,700
Go, go, RPR, go!

404
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,620
You're pulling me back!

405
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,400
You cannot say I'm pulling you back.

406
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:43,980
You have to be specific.

407
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,260
Because it's not me.

408
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:45,780
You're so fucking...

409
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,020
I'm pulling both.

410
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,260
Look at who's at the furthest back.

411
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,480
Look at who's at the furthest back.

412
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,380
And it's not me.

413
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,700
RPR, I fucking climbed!

414
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,640
Okay, now I don't remember.

415
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:02,580
Can I skip here?

416
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,400
I don't remember where to go.

417
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,320
I think it's also far.

418
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,720
No, no, no, you can't.

419
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,220
You can't.

420
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,920
You just keep jumping back up.

421
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,300
Are you fucking kidding me?

422
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,020
Are you?

423
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,940
Are you kidding me?

424
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,080
RPR, are you fucking kidding me?

425
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,800
What did I do?

426
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:18,720
I sat still.

427
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,740
You fucking did it!

428
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,840
Jesus Maria, bro.

429
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,720
How is this my fault?

430
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,940
You fell and it's all me!

431
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,080
I wasn't moving!

432
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,100
You pulled me!

433
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,260
And you fell!

434
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,800
What do you mean?

435
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,380
It was you!

436
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,760
How is it me?

437
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:42,580
How is it me?

438
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,560
Give me one good reason how that was me.

439
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,140
Because when you fell, I fell and then Vito fell.

440
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:47,480
You fell first!

441
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,780
You know what?

442
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,320
You're on Twitch.

443
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,540
Somebody clip RPR falling first.

444
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:51,780
I'm not on Twitch.

445
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,260
I'm banned.

446
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:52,960
I'm banned.

447
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,880
Somebody clip him right now.

448
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,420
Clip him of him falling off first.

449
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,220
And then tag him and me.

450
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,560
And I'll retweet it.

451
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:09,140
Why did I sign up for this shit?

452
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,700
Also, clip him saying that he's... I don't know.

453
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,300
You try.

454
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,060
I'll try.

455
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:15,060
Okay.

456
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:15,800
Okay.

457
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,360
Wait.

458
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:16,360
Wait.

459
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,680
Vito, pull us up!

460
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,340
Pull us up!

461
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:20,620
E!

462
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,420
Hold E!

463
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:22,900
E!

464
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,200
Press E!

465
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:24,840
Press E!

466
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:25,640
Okay.

467
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:25,880
Okay.

468
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,180
Go.

469
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:27,760
Go.

470
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,900
This is why we should have went beginner.

471
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,960
This is exactly why.

472
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,000
I don't know why we're not in beginner.

473
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:34,520
No, we're fine.

474
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,140
Look at this skip we just invented.

475
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,400
How are we fine?

476
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,820
We almost fell.

477
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,120
The amount of time it took us to pull each other back.

478
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,820
It's wasted our time.

479
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,620
We were falling because of you.

480
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,700
You need positive mental attitude.

481
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:49,400
Oh yeah.

482
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,100
I'm not positive here.

483
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,080
I'm not the positive one.

484
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:53,300
You know what?

485
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,500
We should let Ditto lead us.

486
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,460
We should let her lead us.

487
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:57,860
Yeah, you're doing great.

488
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:58,740
You're doing great.

489
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,500
You're doing great too.

490
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,440
Pull me!

491
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,000
Pull me!

492
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,180
Nah, did I sign up?

493
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:06,480
No.

494
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,760
What did I sign up for?

495
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,660
You said yes.

496
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:10,980
Focus up.

497
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:11,420
Focus up.

498
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:11,940
Focus up.

499
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:12,300
Focus up.

500
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:12,920
Focus up.

501
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,840
Walk the chain.

502
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,340
Walk the chain.

503
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,020
Focus up.

504
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:16,700
Yeah, yeah.

505
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,100
I'm fucking focused up.

506
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,800
But you guys are pulling me down.

507
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,000
Speedrun this.

508
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,380
Speedrun this.

509
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:22,400
Speedrun this.

510
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,520
There you go.

511
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:24,700
Speedrun.

512
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:25,380
Speedrun.

513
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,740
Why are you guys so slow?

514
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,360
Speedrun right here.

515
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:28,760
Right side.

516
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,140
Right side.

517
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,220
Oh my god.

518
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,500
No, no, no.

519
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,760
My god.

520
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,520
You're right.

521
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,740
I know what I'm doing.

522
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,900
I don't know about you guys.

523
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,920
I know what I'm doing.

524
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,540
Well, you can't do anything that we don't do.

525
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,240
Because we're cheating together.

526
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,140
Some people play this game solo.

527
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,340
Which I don't understand why.

528
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,360
Because it's like...

529
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:50,880
What's the point?

530
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,520
It's basically only up.

531
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,580
I guess it's because you guys know only up is removed from Steam.

532
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,700
So they play this as if it's...

533
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,080
Yeah, it is.

534
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,820
It's removed from Steam.

535
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,600
So they play this as if it's only up.

536
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,120
I beat only up at a record world time.

537
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,480
Okay.

538
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,900
Somebody's fucking...

539
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,560
Yeah, you're lying.

540
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,540
Ditto, how long have you...

541
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,520
How long have you been awake, Ditto?

542
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,160
Um...

543
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,080
Maybe...

544
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,640
15 hours.

545
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,160
Oh my god.

546
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,180
Guys, she's been playing Palwo for 13 hours.

547
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:24,780
Calm down.

548
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,580
Stop pushing.

549
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,980
You can't push anybody.

550
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,500
There's no collateral.

551
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,480
There's literally no...

552
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,480
There's no collision.

553
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,000
There's no collision here.

554
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,180
What do you mean stop pushing me?

555
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,660
You can't push anybody.

556
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,060
You can't push anybody.

557
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:42,800
Stop pushing.

558
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,080
You can push.

559
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,080
No, you can't.

560
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:46,900
There's no collision.

561
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,520
Stop pushing.

562
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,340
You're like... You literally are so far away from me.

563
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,540
How can we push you?

564
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,400
Alright, here we go.

565
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,100
Where are we going?

566
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,120
Right side.

567
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:57,580
Right side.

568
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:57,880
Right side.

569
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,300
It's always right.

570
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,640
How do you know right side?

571
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,340
It's right because I looked at the fucking bones.

572
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,800
What do you mean how do I know?

573
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,620
You look...

574
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,480
Use your eyes.

575
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,540
So if this leads to nothing, who do we blame?

576
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:10,820
Okay.

577
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,180
How many...

578
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,140
Gifted memberships?

579
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:13,780
How many gifted?

580
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,280
I don't got money.

581
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,580
You're not gonna get money out of me.

582
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,120
You're a fucking millionaire.

583
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:21,880
Like why are you...

584
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,460
I am not a millionaire.

585
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:26,400
Have you not seen my fucking re-debut?

586
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,920
I am not a millionaire.

587
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:33,440
Just because you spent your money doesn't mean you weren't a millionaire before you spent it.

588
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,040
Alright, here we go.

589
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:36,260
Oh here, jump set.

590
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:36,740
Second bounce.

591
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,060
Second... Oh my...

592
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:38,660
Second bounce.

593
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,280
Second bounce.

594
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:39,900
Second bounce.

595
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,860
Where are we going?

596
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:41,540
Here we go.

597
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,120
Here we go.

598
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:42,860
Right here.

599
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,560
Okay, are you guys ready?

600
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,580
We have to go straight.

601
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,440
Alright, who's doing the countdown?

602
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:48,860
Now.

603
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:49,420
Go now.

604
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,420
Oh my...

605
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,760
Oh my god.

606
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,480
Jump jump.

607
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,260
Climb it.

608
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:54,960
Climb it to the right.

609
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,200
Climb it to the right.

610
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,720
Drop at the bottom one.

611
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,400
Drop at the bottom one.

612
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:00,840
Drop at the bottom one.

613
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:00,840
Drop at the bottom one.

614
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,360
Now climb.

615
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:02,880
Jump over.

616
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,380
Jump over.

617
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:03,720
Jump over.

618
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,240
Go go go.

619
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,840
Okay, this is good.

620
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,500
This is easy man.

621
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,080
Easy.

622
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,060
How did that work?

623
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,640
It was simple dude.

624
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:13,780
Why are you panicking?

625
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,600
It wasn't even hard.

626
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,100
How did that fucking work?

627
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,240
I didn't...

628
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,700
Oh my god.

629
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,880
She wasn't even hard dude.

630
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,980
We made it.

631
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,220
We made it.

632
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,540
We made it.

633
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:31,980
Alright, ready?

634
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,640
Oh my god.

635
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:36,680
Now what is this?

636
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,220
What is this?

637
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,600
Oh, I don't know.

638
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,000
Who did that?

639
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:41,700
Who did that?

640
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,760
Who did that?

641
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,200
Who did that?

642
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,720
Who was it above me?

643
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,200
RPR.

644
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,380
What did you do RPR?

645
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,540
Oh, it's not me.

646
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,480
How is it my fault that you guys did that?

647
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,460
What do you mean?

648
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,840
You're the only one with a different skin than me.

649
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,600
I was the last one.

650
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,600
You guys are all...

651
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,960
Somebody clip it.

652
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,580
Somebody clip it on RPR's channel and then tag me and then I'll retweet it.

653
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,420
I'm gonna turn my stream off.

654
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,760
I don't even wanna be here.

655
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,540
I will retweet every mistake he's made.

656
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,460
Wait wait wait.

657
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,020
Wait wait wait.

658
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,020
Just get up here.

659
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:27,560
Go.

660
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:29,580
Let's go.

661
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,320
Get up.

662
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:30,760
Get up.

663
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:31,520
Get up.

664
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,420
Okay, here we go.

665
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:35,900
What are you guys doing?

666
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,020
Oh my god.

667
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:37,620
What are you doing?

668
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:38,660
What are you pulling me?

669
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,500
What do you mean what are we...

670
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,580
You literally just walked off.

671
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,000
Wait.

672
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,040
Oh my god.

673
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,040
Oh my god.

674
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,580
Ditto's just like, oh my god.

675
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,780
You're just waiting for us.

676
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,280
Yeah.

677
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,000
Why don't you wait for us RPR?

678
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,940
The only reason Ditto's hating on me is because you're here.

679
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,220
If you weren't here, she would hate on me.

680
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,600
No, she would obviously hate on you.

681
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,320
No dude.

682
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,480
You corrupted her.

683
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,140
We are not hating you.

684
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,860
We're just criticizing you.

685
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,480
That's different.

686
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:11,900
Okay.

687
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,720
First pause.

688
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,940
One step from hate.

689
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:14,380
Second jump.

690
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:14,900
Second jump.

691
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,440
Second jump.

692
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:15,820
Okay.

693
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,020
We go one line.

694
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:20,260
Okay.

695
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,740
We go instantly.

696
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:22,560
Instantly run.

697
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:22,940
Okay.

698
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,680
What the fuck?

699
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,980
Climb to the right.

700
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:27,880
No.

701
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:29,500
Climb to this one and go.

702
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,240
Come on.

703
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,960
It's a skill issue if you can't do this.

704
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,180
Okay.

705
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,440
Oh my god.

706
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,400
That should not work.

707
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,320
Why does that work?

708
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,500
That's no question.

709
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,480
It is.

710
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:44,840
It is.

711
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,620
You're playing with a professional.

712
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,120
That should not work.

713
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:50,640
Alright.

714
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,300
We're okay.

715
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,520
Everything.

716
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,080
Okay.

717
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,600
Now I don't know what to do here.

718
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,800
Don't just spike.

719
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,640
Don't just spike.

720
00:19:58,940 --> 00:19:59,280
Wait.

721
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,200
Wait for the spike.

722
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,820
Are you trolling me?

723
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,900
What are you doing?

724
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,120
You fucking climb.

725
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:04,780
Jump.

726
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,080
I am first.

727
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:06,720
Alright.

728
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,100
What happened to go?

729
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,100
I saved it.

730
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:17,580
I saved it.

731
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,260
I saved it.

732
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:18,960
What do you mean?

733
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,500
We all need to go at the same time.

734
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,820
We can go at the same time.

735
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:24,940
Wait.

736
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:25,500
Wait.

737
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,120
Wait for me.

738
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,200
Right here.

739
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:31,020
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

740
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,400
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

741
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,380
Wait, wait, wait!

742
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,300
Ok, ok!

743
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,820
Go, go, go, go!

744
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,880
We're learning, but it's a learning process.

745
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,120
Why are you saying to be mad?

746
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,880
Wait, what's in here?

747
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,620
We don't care, we don't care.

748
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,800
Ok, ok.

749
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,080
I don't think there's anymore...

750
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,840
There is no spike here.

751
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,440
Yeah, we should be good.

752
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,760
There is no more spikes.

753
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,120
Okay, it's easy.

754
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,740
Okay, who is doing 3-2-1?

755
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:08,360
Who is doing it?

756
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:08,780
In one line.

757
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,920
In one line, okay.

758
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:10,420
Okay.

759
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,060
It has...

760
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,200
There is only one ride.

761
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:12,840
Next time it comes, we go.

762
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:13,720
Okay.

763
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,120
Okay.

764
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,200
Next time it comes, we go.

765
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,580
Okay, but who is counting down?

766
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,180
Now go.

767
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:18,980
Oh, okay.

768
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:20,640
Oh, we almost...

769
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,340
Oh, we almost...

770
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,180
My god.

771
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:22,880
Oh, we are fine.

772
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:23,700
We are fine.

773
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,620
Let's not keep pool.

774
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,340
Let's not keep pool.

775
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,100
Let's not keep pool.

776
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,460
No, perfect.

777
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,360
Alright, ready?

778
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,560
3-2-1, go.

779
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,620
Alright, nice.

780
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,880
3-2-1, go.

781
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,220
Why couldn't you do that earlier for the first one?

782
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,680
3-2-1, go.

783
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,680
3-2-1, go.

784
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,440
Look at us.

785
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,100
We are a team.

786
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,580
3-2-1, go.

787
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,140
We are a team, guys.

788
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,600
We are a team.

789
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,360
Okay.

790
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,480
Okay, now we obviously have two choices.

791
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,640
We should do this one.

792
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,800
What is this?

793
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,420
What is this?

794
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:57,820
What is this?

795
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,180
What is this?

796
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:58,820
Can we even...

797
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:59,600
Is this even a choice?

798
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,480
No, I don't think that's a choice.

799
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,620
It's not even a choice.

800
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,240
Yeah, we can't even do anything here.

801
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,600
Oh, hey, it's this one.

802
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:06,960
Let's get down here.

803
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:07,980
Okay.

804
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:08,440
Oh.

805
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,000
Oh, you're gonna jump over this.

806
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,920
What are you guys doing?

807
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,980
What are you guys doing?

808
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:17,160
Why did you just look at it?

809
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,620
Why were you guys looking at it?

810
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,580
3-2-1, go.

811
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,560
I was just admiring the view.

812
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,680
Oh, I'm too strong for my good.

813
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,620
Pull me, pull me, pull me.

814
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:26,800
Oh, my God.

815
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:27,440
Okay.

816
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,440
Okay.

817
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,300
3-2-1, go.

818
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:30,800
Yay.

819
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,940
3-2-1, go.

820
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,720
Okay, look at that, guys.

821
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,420
Oh, my God.

822
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:36,920
Perfect.

823
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,700
We should be a team, guys.

824
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,640
Where do we go?

825
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:40,200
Oh.

826
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,080
Up here.

827
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,040
Up here.

828
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:42,820
Up here.

829
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:43,580
And then...

830
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,420
And then what?

831
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:44,720
Up here.

832
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,220
Okay, and then what?

833
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,020
And then up here.

834
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:47,600
There's a ladder.

835
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:50,440
There's...

836
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,120
What?

837
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,140
There's a ladder.

838
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:52,800
Oh.

839
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,360
There's a ladder.

840
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:54,520
Oh.

841
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,360
How are you supposed to see this?

842
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,140
How are you supposed to see this?

843
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:05,340
We did all that and there's a ladder.

844
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,200
In my defense, I was cooking.

845
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,580
What were you cooking?

846
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,120
Clearly, it wasn't anything.

847
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:11,660
It's lazy.

848
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,300
It's lazy.

849
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,860
We have to jump.

850
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,640
Okay, ready?

851
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,320
Okay.

852
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,020
Walk with me.

853
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:16,580
Walk with me.

854
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:17,260
Yeah.

855
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,380
Oh, God.

856
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:18,980
Oh.

857
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:19,180
Jump.

858
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:19,600
Oh.

859
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:20,720
Oh, no.

860
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,700
There's spikes too.

861
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,280
No.

862
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,360
Grab this ledge.

863
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,300
Grab this ledge.

864
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,680
What's that?

865
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,620
There's spikes.

866
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,920
Here we go again.

867
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,640
Like, why didn't we play normal?

868
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,300
We gotta speedrun now.

869
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:38,940
We gotta speedrun.

870
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,060
Why didn't we play normal?

871
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:41,920
We are playing normal.

872
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,240
Why couldn't we do baby mode?

873
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:47,220
Doki.

874
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:47,560
Doki.

875
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:52,280
You think that our chat would let us fucking play nothing but normal?

876
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:52,420
We just don't tell them.

877
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,060
We just don't tell them.

878
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,260
You think they don't know this game?

879
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,540
They know more about this game than we do.

880
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:59,100
Every time we drop off, we turn off our stream.

881
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,060
And then...

882
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:04,820
We hide our screen every time we turn and we drop off.

883
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,180
And then respawn.

884
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:07,480
What?

885
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,920
For scientific purposes, what is your title?

886
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,040
My title...

887
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:13,640
What do you mean?

888
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,140
Is a science change gator.

889
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,480
With Doki and Appio.

890
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,180
Wait, what was the title?

891
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,620
What was your title?

892
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:22,160
Wait, I wanna know what your title was.

893
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,360
What was it?

894
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,640
Just go... Just read it.

895
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,840
Should I take a screenshot?

896
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,960
Chain together with Doki and Appio.

897
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:32,840
I don't know.

898
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,020
Wait, what are we supposed to look at?

899
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,480
It says chain together with lovely Doki and...

900
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,160
The handsome RPR.

901
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,340
Yeah, that's what it says.

902
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,680
Yeah, it says that.

903
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,620
Can you read this for me?

904
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,980
What are we supposed to look at?

905
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,760
What do you see?

906
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,820
Yeah, what do you see?

907
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,400
What do you see?

908
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:52,180
Nothing.

909
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,040
Don't worry guys.

910
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:53,720
I'll just show this.

911
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,560
What was it?

912
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,160
What?

913
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,180
What is it?

914
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:58,980
See, I told you.

915
00:24:59,080 --> 00:24:59,560
It's not...

916
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,480
Are you gonna flame me?

917
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,140
Yeah, why are you flaming her?

918
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,260
She has...

919
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,940
Oh my god!

920
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,360
Look at what you're doing RPR!

921
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,260
RPR!

922
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,440
RPR, what are you doing?

923
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,620
Guys, guys.

924
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,720
How is this my fault?

925
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,640
I didn't even move!

926
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,820
I didn't even move.

927
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:22,440
Now you're throwing.

928
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:22,900
Why are you throwing?

929
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,180
Why are you throwing?

930
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,180
You didn't move, so we fall, okay?

931
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:26,600
Yeah!

932
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,220
We're clearly trying to do something here.

933
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,740
We're trying to be gamers and you're like...

934
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,460
Ah, let's go then.

935
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:33,780
Let's go.

936
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:33,940
Go.

937
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,100
3, 2, 1, go.

938
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,000
3, 2, 1, go.

939
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:36,900
3, 2, 1, go.

940
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,540
Wait, are we jumping on one or are we jumping at go?

941
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,020
Go.

942
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,800
Why can't we jump on one?

943
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,600
It's easier.

944
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,660
Because it's 3, 2, 1, go.

945
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,300
It's obviously you jump on go because why would you...

946
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:51,980
I don't know.

947
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:52,420
I don't know because...

948
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,120
3, 2, 1, go.

949
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,620
Because like sometimes you guys are...

950
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:55,840
3, 2, 1, go.

951
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,160
Yeah, see?

952
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,140
Just... we don't need to do 3, 2, 1.

953
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:58,840
It's the beginning.

954
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,420
Okay, you wish to say go every time?

955
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:02,840
Yeah.

956
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:10,420
By the time we hear go, the ping will... yeah, you would jump because of ping.

957
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,500
I bet you if you just say go, we'll be so coordinated.

958
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,580
Why am I eye-jelling?

959
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,200
Alright, watch this.

960
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:18,780
Go.

961
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,320
See?

962
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:20,820
Look.

963
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:21,720
Go.

964
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,040
Go.

965
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:22,840
Go.

966
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:24,200
Go.

967
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:24,840
Go.

968
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,460
You don't need to go for this.

969
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,300
I would hope.

970
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:35,980
Look at us go.

971
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,620
We're so good.

972
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:39,740
Alright.

973
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,460
Come on, Ditto.

974
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,820
Alright, second jump.

975
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:42,840
Second jump, we...

976
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,540
We can jump, okay?

977
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,380
Second jump, okay?

978
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:45,400
Alright.

979
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,780
Second jump, you're here.

980
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,600
Now we go.

981
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:48,840
Go.

982
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:49,220
Go.

983
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:49,360
Go.

984
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:50,720
Alright.

985
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,140
Second jump.

986
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:52,580
Second jump.

987
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,340
Okay.

988
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:54,860
Go.

989
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:55,060
Go.

990
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:55,340
Go.

991
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:55,640
Go.

992
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:56,580
See?

993
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,460
Go works.

994
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:57,880
One.

995
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,320
Go works.

996
00:26:59,480 --> 00:26:59,780
Two.

997
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,360
Go.

998
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:00,660
Go.

999
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:00,920
Go.

1000
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,100
Go.

1001
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:01,840
Good job, guys.

1002
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,200
Good job.

1003
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,140
Good job.

1004
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:04,840
Look at that.

1005
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,600
Keep moving.

1006
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:07,800
Okay.

1007
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,100
Guys, I think we're gamers.

1008
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:11,600
Yeah.

1009
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,200
I think we're doing really well.

1010
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,560
Wait, did any of us actually beat OnlyUp?

1011
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,600
I said it was easy.

1012
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:17,960
I did.

1013
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:17,980
I did.

1014
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:18,840
I beat OnlyUp.

1015
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:19,020
Easy.

1016
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,680
I beat OnlyUp.

1017
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,200
Don't...

1018
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,060
Don't beat something like that.

1019
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,460
You beat OnlyUp.

1020
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:23,640
I beat OnlyUp.

1021
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,580
Then why are you so...

1022
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,020
I think I beat OnlyUp like under an hour.

1023
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,400
I'm pretty sure.

1024
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,660
Yeah, but then why is...

1025
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,720
Why are you struggling?

1026
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:32,900
I got less than an hour.

1027
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,220
I beat it in 30 minutes.

1028
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:38,040
That was my speedrun record.

1029
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:38,400
Because...

1030
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:38,640
Doki.

1031
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,060
Doki.

1032
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,340
I am chained to you.

1033
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:40,720
You understand?

1034
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,180
That is why I suck right now.

1035
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,280
But I had a speedrun record of 30 minutes.

1036
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,020
No, you didn't.

1037
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:47,420
Yes, I did.

1038
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,240
Liar.

1039
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,400
You're the liar here.

1040
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:50,660
You're the liar.

1041
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,600
You did not beat it in under less than an hour.

1042
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,640
Yes, I did.

1043
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,080
There's...

1044
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,120
There's wads out there.

1045
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:55,400
Where's the proof?

1046
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,020
Where's the proof?

1047
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,200
In the wads.

1048
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:58,560
Like...

1049
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,300
What wad?

1050
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,060
Why would I lie?

1051
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,160
Is he lying?

1052
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:02,580
Yeah, he's lying.

1053
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:02,980
You see what you did?

1054
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,020
You see what you did?

1055
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:08,600
I don't know.

1056
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:08,900
That's two to one.

1057
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,460
Even my chat...

1058
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,200
My chat...

1059
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,780
My chat that's never on my side is saying he did.

1060
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:13,640
There's a wad.

1061
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,300
My chat was like, he's lying.

1062
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,980
Okay, but your chat's wrong.

1063
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:19,840
My...

1064
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,500
My...

1065
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:20,640
I don't know.

1066
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:20,760
I don't know.

1067
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:20,920
My chat's wrong.

1068
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,820
On the next one, we're running straight.

1069
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:22,500
Go.

1070
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,220
Okay.

1071
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,400
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1072
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:26,860
See, look at that.

1073
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:27,880
It's that easy.

1074
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,720
It's that easy.

1075
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,000
RBR, it's not good to lie.

1076
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,020
It's not good for your heart.

1077
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:35,780
How...

1078
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,380
How...

1079
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:36,740
How...

1080
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,140
How can you come so fast?

1081
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,000
How?

1082
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,100
Because I'm good.

1083
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,540
Because I have legs.

1084
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:44,860
I have...

1085
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:45,320
Why?

1086
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:45,960
Why are you so slow?

1087
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,260
Why are you so slow?

1088
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:47,640
I don't know.

1089
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,060
I just...

1090
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:49,540
I just...

1091
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:50,200
Come on, we're passing.

1092
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:50,620
I just...

1093
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:51,680
We're passing the bear.

1094
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:55,200
Okay, to be fair, the ping is not as bad as I thought.

1095
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:56,520
Okay.

1096
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,640
I don't think ping matters in this game.

1097
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,880
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

1098
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,460
Okay, we're okay.

1099
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:03,860
We're okay.

1100
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:04,540
Stop.

1101
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,400
Okay.

1102
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,460
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1103
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,040
We die together if we fuck up.

1104
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:11,820
Okay, there you go.

1105
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:12,580
See, look at that.

1106
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:13,800
Okay.

1107
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:14,900
It's that easy.

1108
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,400
Move, move, move.

1109
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,120
Speedrun only.

1110
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:17,680
Speedrun only.

1111
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,340
What even is the speedrun for this?

1112
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:20,600
We will...

1113
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,040
I wonder.

1114
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,920
Chat, what's the speedrun?

1115
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,340
I mean, we can literally look at...

1116
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:29,460
My chat said it was under 45 minutes.

1117
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,620
Okay, so this is like an 8-hour game then.

1118
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:33,160
Go!

1119
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,960
No, I'm talking only up.

1120
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,420
Oh, only up.

1121
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,080
Wait, wait, wait.

1122
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,180
Okay, pull me.

1123
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:40,800
Okay, perfect.

1124
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:42,800
Okay.

1125
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,520
Go.

1126
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,160
Go.

1127
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,040
Go.

1128
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:46,620
Go.

1129
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:47,500
Go.

1130
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,020
Go.

1131
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:48,280
Go.

1132
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:48,480
Go.

1133
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,480
Why are you singing in pink after me?

1134
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,460
Go, go, Power Rangers!

1135
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:53,340
Okay.

1136
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,320
Up here.

1137
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,820
Okay, let's wait for the next ship.

1138
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:57,380
Okay.

1139
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,060
I'm waiting.

1140
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,420
If I could push, I would push you.

1141
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,600
I was just thinking if I could punch in this game.

1142
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,360
Holy shit.

1143
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,520
Okay, we don't need callouts for this.

1144
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:13,080
This is like your own adventure for that.

1145
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:14,840
Okay.

1146
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,060
Up here.

1147
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:16,260
Ready?

1148
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,000
Yeah.

1149
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:17,180
Go.

1150
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:19,720
Go.

1151
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:21,660
Go.

1152
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:26,400
How come whenever you say go, you wait like two seconds and then you jump?

1153
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,860
Yeah, because I have to.

1154
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,860
All right, all right.

1155
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,400
Let's not get fucked here.

1156
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,820
I don't know what happened last time.

1157
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:37,420
Okay.

1158
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,340
What was that?

1159
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,900
So it's a laser and then it spikes.

1160
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,500
Okay, it's because we touched the laser.

1161
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,420
If we touch the laser, we drop off.

1162
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:46,580
Oh, yes.

1163
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,060
Yes.

1164
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:47,560
If we touch the laser.

1165
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,440
No, we don't touch the laser.

1166
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:48,900
We don't touch the laser.

1167
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,820
We will be okay.

1168
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:53,040
So jump over the laser and then jump over the laser again.

1169
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:53,440
Okay?

1170
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:53,780
Okay.

1171
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:53,960
Ready?

1172
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:55,580
Why?

1173
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,120
Okay.

1174
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:56,780
Okay.

1175
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:57,440
Right here.

1176
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:57,780
Right here.

1177
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,040
Jump.

1178
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,240
Go, go, go, go.

1179
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,180
Oh my God.

1180
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:02,720
You're crazy.

1181
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:03,680
You're crazy.

1182
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,120
Not even close.

1183
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:05,780
What's that?

1184
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,120
Not...

1185
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:07,860
Guys, give me a sec.

1186
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,320
Give me a sec.

1187
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,100
I need to grab the cough drop.

1188
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:10,820
Okay, I'm ready.

1189
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:11,600
This way.

1190
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:11,820
Okay.

1191
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,360
Right side?

1192
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:13,900
Hold now.

1193
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:14,660
Right side.

1194
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,460
Right side.

1195
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,040
It has a trampoline.

1196
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:16,760
Ready?

1197
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:16,840
On.

1198
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,000
Go.

1199
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,240
Go.

1200
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:19,740
Okay.

1201
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:20,680
Second jump.

1202
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,080
Second jump.

1203
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:21,920
Okay.

1204
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:22,660
All right.

1205
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,460
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

1206
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:26,920
All right.

1207
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,400
Second jump.

1208
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:27,760
Second jump.

1209
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:29,200
Two.

1210
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,580
Fox, fox.

1211
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,040
What's this?

1212
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:32,340
What's this?

1213
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,120
Jump and jump key to...

1214
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:35,180
How do we...

1215
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:36,580
How do we do it?

1216
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,640
Jump and hold jump key.

1217
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:38,280
Oh, okay.

1218
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:38,700
Goodbye.

1219
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,240
Guys, guys, guys.

1220
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,460
I'm leaving.

1221
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,280
Guys, I'm leaving.

1222
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,520
Don't let go.

1223
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:44,720
Don't let go.

1224
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,100
Guys, I'm leaving you guys.

1225
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:57,590
You're helping us get up there.

1226
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:59,070
What the fuck?

1227
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:05,350
Look at them getting carried by the giga chat that I am.

1228
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:06,290
Oh, yeah.

1229
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:06,690
Yeah.

1230
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:08,170
Straight carry.

1231
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:09,790
This way.

1232
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:10,370
This way.

1233
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:11,210
This way.

1234
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:11,750
We're just waiting.

1235
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:13,570
Where are we going?

1236
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:14,350
Why did you...

1237
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:14,910
Okay.

1238
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:15,330
Okay.

1239
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:16,550
I was like, why did you let go?

1240
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:17,930
What was this?

1241
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:18,630
It was a car.

1242
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:19,050
Sit back.

1243
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:20,030
Let me drive.

1244
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:20,710
Okay.

1245
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:21,150
It was a car.

1246
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:22,470
Let me drive, guys.

1247
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:22,930
Okay.

1248
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,190
Oh, red car.

1249
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:26,050
Yay.

1250
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:28,490
We don't have to do anything, Ziddo.

1251
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:29,990
We don't have to...

1252
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,250
It's RPR's fault.

1253
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:32,490
Yeah, it's RPR's fault.

1254
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:32,890
We die.

1255
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:34,130
RPR.

1256
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:34,810
RPR.

1257
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:36,570
RPR.

1258
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:37,630
RPR.

1259
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:37,890
RPR.

1260
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:39,050
What are you doing?

1261
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:41,450
Do you even have a driver's license?

1262
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:43,490
Of course I do.

1263
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:44,290
Who do you think you are?

1264
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:45,530
Why?

1265
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:45,950
Okay.

1266
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:48,410
Why are you like getting hit by the thing?

1267
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:50,630
It's literally like so big.

1268
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,450
I'm not hit by the thing.

1269
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:52,690
I'm not hit by anything.

1270
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:54,670
Do you see us passing this stage with ease?

1271
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:56,410
You're like reading your chat while driving.

1272
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:58,030
You should never text and drive.

1273
00:32:58,430 --> 00:32:59,470
That's against the rules.

1274
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:01,490
You need to close your chat right now.

1275
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:03,850
Do you see what you're doing?

1276
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:08,070
Do you want to fly off the map?

1277
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:09,770
Because I can make that happen right now.

1278
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:12,270
Yeah, but you're just prolonging your madness.

1279
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:14,550
You see this?

1280
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:15,930
I got us here in three seconds.

1281
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:16,650
Look at me.

1282
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:17,650
Wait, wait.

1283
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:18,830
My character is shush.

1284
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:20,070
My character is shush.

1285
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:20,250
Wait.

1286
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:20,490
Yeah.

1287
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:21,190
What happened?

1288
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:22,510
I didn't know.

1289
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:24,070
Wait, guys.

1290
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:25,510
What was this?

1291
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,370
I don't like this.

1292
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:28,250
Oh, we have to jump to the...

1293
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:29,690
When it rotates, we have to jump.

1294
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:30,510
Yeah.

1295
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:30,750
Yeah.

1296
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:31,390
Follow the rotation.

1297
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:32,110
It's like Fortnite.

1298
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,130
I played this in Fortnite.

1299
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:34,410
I did this in Twitch Rivals.

1300
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:34,830
Fortnite.

1301
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:35,610
Fortnite.

1302
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:36,950
I did this in Twitch Rivals.

1303
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:38,290
Fortnite Battle Pass.

1304
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:38,850
Okay.

1305
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:39,470
I can do it.

1306
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:40,150
Oh my God.

1307
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:41,250
You became a...

1308
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:42,510
Are you a woman or a...

1309
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:43,210
No, you're still...

1310
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:44,290
Wait, you became younger.

1311
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:45,550
Or not?

1312
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:46,110
I don't know.

1313
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:46,910
I don't know.

1314
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:49,450
You're the only prehistoric dinosaur in here, Doki.

1315
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:50,110
Oh my God.

1316
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:52,070
Hey, I have knowledge.

1317
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:52,670
Okay?

1318
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:54,750
The older you get, the more knowledgeable you are.

1319
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:56,550
Maybe I died once and I was born.

1320
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:57,530
Reincarnated.

1321
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:00,150
You got reincarnated.

1322
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:01,030
Are you guys ready?

1323
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:02,070
Three.

1324
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:02,630
Two.

1325
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:04,170
One, go...

1326
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:05,550
Okay.

1327
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:06,830
Up.

1328
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:07,670
Okay.

1329
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:08,730
Keep jumping.

1330
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:09,670
Keep falling.

1331
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:10,110
Okay.

1332
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:12,230
Keep jumping on your own table.

1333
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:12,890
Right side.

1334
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:13,330
Right side.

1335
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:14,730
Pull up here.

1336
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:15,710
Are you pulling me.

1337
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:16,190
Side.

1338
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:16,610
What the hell.

1339
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:17,430
What the hell, what the hell?

1340
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:18,610
Are you pulling me.

1341
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:19,530
Back, back, back, back.

1342
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:20,450
I'm not pulling you anywhere!

1343
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:21,030
Stop coming!

1344
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:21,950
Go forward!

1345
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:22,370
Go forward!

1346
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:23,290
Go forward!

1347
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:24,370
I'm coming!

1348
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:26,310
Jesus Christ!

1349
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:28,510
Okay, I got this.

1350
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:29,130
I got this.

1351
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:30,090
Everything is okay!

1352
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,390
I got it too.

1353
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:31,870
I got it too.

1354
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:34,310
There we go.

1355
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:35,650
I got it too, guys.

1356
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:37,190
I figured it out as well.

1357
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:37,450
Go left.

1358
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:38,030
Go left.

1359
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:40,350
Jump up here.

1360
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:42,930
I'm here!

1361
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:43,590
I can jump!

1362
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:44,330
Okay.

1363
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:45,950
Go right.

1364
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:46,930
Jump up here.

1365
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:47,730
See?

1366
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:48,930
It's not so bad.

1367
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:49,690
Go left.

1368
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:50,310
Go left.

1369
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:51,130
It's terrible.

1370
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:51,970
Okay.

1371
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:53,030
Jump up.

1372
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:56,490
Now wait.

1373
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:56,910
No.

1374
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:57,450
Wait.

1375
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:00,370
Sit on this ramp.

1376
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:01,070
Where are you going?

1377
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:02,170
Sit on this ramp right here.

1378
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:03,630
What the hell are you doing?

1379
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:05,250
I got it!

1380
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:07,330
What is she doing?

1381
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:09,190
Okay.

1382
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:09,630
Go!

1383
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:09,950
Go!

1384
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:10,170
Go!

1385
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:12,870
What do you mean, what am I doing?

1386
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:15,110
I'm just having a great time with my friends.

1387
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:16,270
Go.

1388
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:17,510
Yay.

1389
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:19,170
Go.

1390
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:19,990
Yay.

1391
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:21,730
Go.

1392
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:22,390
Yay.

1393
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:23,790
Go.

1394
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:24,810
See?

1395
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:25,570
It's not so bad.

1396
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:27,930
I feel like we're doing really well compared to other people.

1397
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:29,190
Go.

1398
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:31,630
I think it's just because we're gamers.

1399
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:32,070
Go.

1400
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:33,790
Are you guys ignoring me?

1401
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:34,650
Go.

1402
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:35,190
Yes.

1403
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:36,370
Go.

1404
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:39,410
I just wanted conversation.

1405
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:42,410
This game should not just be go.

1406
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:43,410
Sorry.

1407
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:44,850
We need entertainment.

1408
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:47,510
Go.

1409
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:51,350
And she falls.

1410
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:53,830
And she has to do conversation.

1411
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:55,030
Go.

1412
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:57,930
Our chat chat just here.

1413
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:58,270
Go.

1414
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:00,410
We need other stuff.

1415
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:02,950
Do you want to win or do you want to lose?

1416
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:04,350
Okay.

1417
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:05,990
I'm already winning.

1418
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:06,770
Go.

1419
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:09,650
Second jump.

1420
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:11,570
Second jump.

1421
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:11,990
Second jump.

1422
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,130
Oh my god.

1423
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:13,590
Okay.

1424
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:14,510
This way.

1425
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:15,190
This way.

1426
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:15,310
This way.

1427
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:17,190
Here we go.

1428
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:18,710
Now here comes the pain train.

1429
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:19,930
Analyze.

1430
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:21,830
Analyze.

1431
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:23,770
We jump left.

1432
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:25,050
Then we jump right.

1433
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:26,470
And then we jump left.

1434
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:27,830
We go go go.

1435
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:29,370
Left right left.

1436
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:29,810
Go.

1437
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:31,870
We just fucking do this.

1438
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:32,290
Go.

1439
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:33,870
Go.

1440
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:35,990
Yay.

1441
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:36,870
You did it.

1442
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:38,090
What is this button?

1443
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:40,330
Oh it's timed.

1444
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:42,390
I think we should do it.

1445
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:42,750
Wait wait wait.

1446
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:43,770
No no it's timed.

1447
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:45,270
It has to be timed because of the music.

1448
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:47,310
I think it's timed.

1449
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:50,230
Or not.

1450
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:52,210
It's not?

1451
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:53,070
It's not.

1452
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:54,730
There's no time.

1453
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:56,750
We're gonna wait longer.

1454
00:36:57,210 --> 00:36:58,430
But what if it's not?

1455
00:36:58,710 --> 00:36:59,110
Oh okay.

1456
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,630
Yeah yeah yeah.

1457
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:01,510
Okay.

1458
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:02,090
Ready?

1459
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:03,170
Go.

1460
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:04,510
Go go go.

1461
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,090
Faster faster faster.

1462
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:07,790
Jumping only.

1463
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:08,490
Jumping only.

1464
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:09,590
I am jumping.

1465
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:10,730
What are you guys doing?

1466
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:11,510
Stop climbing.

1467
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:12,330
Just jumping.

1468
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:14,330
What are you guys... I'm literally ahead of you.

1469
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:15,090
Go faster.

1470
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:15,730
Stop.

1471
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:17,370
I'm literally ahead of you.

1472
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:18,310
Stop climbing.

1473
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:18,870
Good jump.

1474
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:20,990
I'm really ahead of you.

1475
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:22,370
Stop climbing.

1476
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:28,510
Not even close.

1477
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:30,070
It's not even close.

1478
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:31,770
It's okay.

1479
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:32,670
It's not close.

1480
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:33,450
Yeah.

1481
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:34,030
Go.

1482
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:35,330
Yeah.

1483
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:35,750
Yeah.

1484
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:38,490
Go.

1485
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:39,110
Yeah.

1486
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:40,190
Yeah.

1487
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:41,310
Go.

1488
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:43,430
I think it's weird.

1489
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:44,830
This game is not even hard.

1490
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:46,330
How are people struggling with this shit?

1491
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:48,350

00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:05,650
This game isn't even hard.

1502
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:08,190
This game isn't even hard.

1503
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:11,850
This game isn't even hard.

1504
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:12,550
This game isn't even hard.

1505
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:14,190
Guys how long...

1506
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:16,130

1507
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:17,610
Well I hope so.

1508
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:19,150
I hope so.

1509
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:20,570
Oh there it is.

1510
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:21,290
It just came back.

1511
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:21,550
Yeah.

1512
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:23,230
Okay ready?

How long is this game?

1515
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,350
Guys we need to know.

1516
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:28,990
How long is this game?

1517
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:30,650
Like an average completion rate.

1518
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:32,530
How long is this game?

1519
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:32,530
Like an average completion rate.

1520
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:34,950
According to my calculations, 45 minutes.

1521
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:37,430
According to my calculations, 45 minutes.

1522
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:38,270
We're not speeding.

1523
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:40,730
Maybe we can do a speedrun.

1524
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:43,110
Maybe we can do a speedrun.

1525
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:45,730
Someone said 5 hours.

1526
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:47,190
Someone was just like yes.

1527
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:50,030
We've done 1 out of 10.

1528
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:52,250
We've done 1 out of 10.

1529
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:54,590
This is 1 out of 10th of the progress.

1530
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:54,950
This is 1 out of 10th of the progress.

1531
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:55,650
We have to swim?

1532
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:56,730
How do we swim?

1533
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:59,410
Control control control.

1534
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:01,830
Yeah yeah yeah control.

1535
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,430
Please I need a breathe.

1536
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:05,850
Please please I will drown.

1537
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:08,350
Wait can you drown?

1538
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:09,170
I don't know.

1539
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:10,070
I'm gonna try.

1540
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:11,630
Okay ditto go drown.

1541
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:15,670
It's 3600 meters and we did 500.

1542
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:16,470
I don't think we can though.

1543
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:19,930
We did 500 meters and 3600 meters.

1544
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:22,330
Oh it's 3600 meters?

1545
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:23,510
Like 3600?

1546
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:25,050
Wait then we're 1 fifth.

1547
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:29,510
5, 10, 15, 20.

1548
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:29,830
Can you do math?

1549
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:30,250
This isn't 1 seventh.

1550
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:31,810
25, 30.

1551
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:32,670
Oh what?

1552
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:33,090

1554
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:35,150
Hahaha.

1555
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:39,550
We're 1 seventh.

1556
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:44,990
We're 1 fifth guys.

1557
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:45,370
Oh yeah.

1558
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:49,430
It's closer now.

1559
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:50,490
500 meters.

1560
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:51,590
Okay.

1561
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:52,390
500 meters.

1562
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:53,410
Alright.

1563
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:54,490
Where is this?

1564
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:55,610

1565
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:57,130

1566
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:58,150
Okay.

1567
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:02,350
We have to press all the buttons.

1568
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:04,350
There's a timer on them.

1569
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:06,370
Wait right side.

1570
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:07,130
Right side is closer.

1571
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:08,750
Go to the right.

1572
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:09,370
Go to the right.

1573
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:10,210
Okay.

1574
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:10,570
Okay.

1575
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:10,870
Go here.

1576
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:13,470
You don't have to jump there.

1577
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:14,530
We can walk there.

1578
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:15,490
No we can't.

1579
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:16,390
What are you doing?

1580
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:19,090
How do we walk?

1581
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:19,630
Okay.

1582
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:19,970
Okay.

1583
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:20,330
Okay.

1584
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:21,010
This way.

1585
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:21,510
This way.

1586
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:24,330
Listen to ditto.

1587
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:25,730
Ditto knows what to do.

1588
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:26,430
RPR.

1589
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:27,610
Come here.

1590
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:28,250
Alright.

1591
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:28,890
And then what?

1592
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:30,330
Up top.

1593
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:32,330
We got bolted.

1594
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:33,230
Pull me.

1595
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:33,690
Pull me.

1596
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:34,250
Up here.

1597
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:37,130
Ready?

1598
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:37,710
Up top.

1599
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:37,930
Yeah.

1600
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:40,590
And then we go to...

1601
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:41,230
Yeah.

1602
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:43,030
Right here.

1603
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:44,130
See?

1604
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:44,990
It's not that bad.

1605
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:47,410
It's not that bad.

1606
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:48,550
Oh it's Mario time.

1607
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:49,530
It's Mario time.

1608
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:50,730
Okay.

1609
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:51,470
Be careful.

1610
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:52,550
There's spikes.

1611
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:53,390
I'm dead.

1612
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:53,670
I'm dead.

1613
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:54,110
No.

1614
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:54,330
No.

1615
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:54,550
No.

1616
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:54,710
No.

1617
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:55,550
We're pulling.

1618
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:56,050
Go up.

1619
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:56,430
Come on.

1620
00:40:56,770 --> 00:40:57,470
Go up.

1621
00:40:57,890 --> 00:40:58,410
Okay.

1622
00:40:58,410 --> 00:40:58,630
Okay.

1623
00:40:58,690 --> 00:40:58,890
Okay.

1624
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:00,410
Yeah.

1625
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:04,950
Okay.

1626
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:05,910
This is bad.

1627
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:07,910
This is really bad.

1628
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:08,810
You know.

1629
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:09,870
Can you like let go.

1630
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:11,930
And then float away?

1631
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:12,630
Haha.

1632
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:16,190
Okay Okay.

1633
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:16,410
Stop.

1634
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:16,810
Stop.

1635
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:17,150
Stop.

1636
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:17,450
Stop.

1637
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:17,790
Stop.

1638
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:19,710
Get closer.

1639
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:20,610
Why are you so far away.

1640
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:21,010
Go.

1641
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:21,150
Go.

1642
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:21,470
Go.

1643
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:21,730
Go.

1644
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:22,110
Go.

1645
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:22,330
Go.

1646
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:24,390
Because we don't need to be that close.

1647
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:25,470
What do you mean?

1648
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:26,070
Yes we do.

1649
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:27,450
Maximum time.

1650
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:27,870
Okay.

1651
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:28,070
No.

1652
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:28,450
No.

1653
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:28,550
No.

1654
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:28,730
No.

1655
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:28,910
No.

1656
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:29,030
No.

1657
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:29,130
No.

1658
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:29,330
No.

1659
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:29,590
No.

1660
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:29,670
No.

1661
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:29,670
No.

1662
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:29,670
No.

1663
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:29,730
No.

1664
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:29,730
No.

1665
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:29,730
No.

1666
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:29,730
No.

1667
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:29,730
No.

1668
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:30,310
This is not a video.

1669
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:45,030
Oh no, okay, okay.

1670
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:46,430
I'm worried.

1671
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:47,750
I'm worried about this.

1672
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:49,110
He might need a 3-2-1.

1673
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:01,210
How did you do it?

1674
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:06,090
Going to thrown up?

1675
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:13,350
We can save this!

1676
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:14,590
WHY?

1677
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:15,070
Why?

1678
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:16,070
Why?

1679
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:18,870
Why?

1680
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:19,610
We're fine.

1681
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:20,430
We're fine.

1682
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:21,850
We're not even that far down.

1683
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:23,790
Oh my god.

1684
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:27,050
To be fair, that was very laggy.

1685
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:28,130
Oh my god.

1686
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:28,590
That was not laggy.

1687
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:32,250
I saved it twice and it kept teleporting me back in the air.

1688
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:36,690
Somebody clip this.

1689
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:39,350
Somebody clip RPR fucking up again.

1690
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:41,370
I did not fuck that up.

1691
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:42,070
That was you guys.

1692
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:44,470
How was I on the other side?

1693
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:45,910
You see what Ditto just did?

1694
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:51,950
I was on the other side.

1695
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:53,950
Oh fuck this again.

1696
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:56,290
We don't need to coordinate.

1697
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:57,610
We just need to use our eyes.

1698
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:00,050
We don't need to coordinate this.

1699
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:02,910
As long as our eyes work, we're fine.

1700
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:03,970
Alright, ready?

1701
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:04,470
Get closer.

1702
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:04,930
Get closer.

1703
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:05,470
Okay.

1704
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:06,390
Okay.

1705
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:09,530
Okay, here we go.

1706
00:43:09,810 --> 00:43:10,530
This side.

1707
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:11,450
This side.

1708
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:11,690
This side.

1709
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:12,050
Okay, just wait.

1710
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:12,630
Just use your eyes.

1711
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:13,410
Just use your eyes.

1712
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:15,750
We don't need to coordinate this.

1713
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:17,510
Just use your eyes.

1714
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:18,450
It's a thief.

1715
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:20,250
It's a thief.

1716
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:22,730
It's a thief.

1717
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:25,190
It's a thief.

1718
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:25,910
Why?

1719
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:28,830
Why?

1720
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:29,530
It's a thief.

1721
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:30,390
It's a thief.

1722
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:35,090
Okay, wait.

1723
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:35,770
Come back.

1724
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:36,350
Come back.

1725
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:37,250
There's a car.

1726
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:37,870
Come back.

1727
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:39,470
We can literally run.

1728
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:41,550
The car is more dangerous.

1729
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:43,490
No, it's not.

1730
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:44,450
I'm a good driver.

1731
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:49,490
Why didn't you use your eyes?

1732
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:52,870
You did not need coordination for that.

1733
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:55,550
You just needed to use your eyes.

1734
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:00,410
No!

1735
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:00,890
No!

1736
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:02,550
I'm getting off the car.

1737
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:03,350
Get off the car.

1738
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:04,510
I don't want to be in a car anymore.

1739
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:06,630
I don't want to be in a car.

1740
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:08,230
It looks easier.

1741
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:09,970
Why are you not getting off the car?

1742
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:13,510
Get off the car!

1743
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:15,210
Get off the car!

1744
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:20,010
This is too close.

1745
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:25,590
Oh my god...

1746
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:26,510
Okay.

1747
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:34,390
I swear to fucking god, I swear to god...

1748
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:37,010
I know people ride bikes in Europe.

1749
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:38,850
But that was terrible.

1750
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:39,950
Okay.

1751
00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:41,630
You would do better.

1752
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:43,530
We don't need the car.

1753
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:44,970
We can literally use our legs.

1754
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:46,470
It doesn't matter.

1755
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:48,050
No, it's not.

1756
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:50,750
What do you mean it's not?

1757
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:52,110
Do you see how long the trail is?

1758
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:54,010
Oh my God.

1759
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:55,610
It doesn't matter.

1760
00:44:55,890 --> 00:44:56,470
The more time...

1761
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:57,590
Focus.

1762
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:00,030
Use your eyes.

1763
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:01,030
Use your eyes.

1764
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:03,350
Pull me.

1765
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:03,630
Pull me.

1766
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:05,850
Use your eyes, please.

1767
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:08,190
Don't push me.

1768
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:08,530
Pull me.

1769
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:08,890
Use your eyes, please.

1770
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:12,470
Okay, okay.

1771
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:17,130
Okay, okay.

1772
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:22,190
Okay, this one is easy.

1773
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:24,030
This one is the easiest one.

1774
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:24,790
Yeah, yeah.

1775
00:45:25,110 --> 00:45:26,370
It's the easier one.

1776
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:26,810
Pull me.

1777
00:45:27,610 --> 00:45:29,110
It's the easier one.

1778
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:29,770
This way.

1779
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:30,730
Okay.

1780
00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:33,390
We don't have the word.

1781
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:34,970
This is the easier one.

1782
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:36,650
Go right.

1783
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:36,650
Go right.

1784
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:36,650
Go right.

1785
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:36,650
Go left.

1786
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:37,250
Go left.

1787
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:37,530
Go left.

1788
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:39,310
I'm going left.

1789
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:39,310
I'm going left.

1790
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:40,930
Okay, I'm jumping.

1791
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:41,590
I'm jumping.

1792
00:45:41,770 --> 00:45:42,670
Now go on the platform.

1793
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:45,330
And wait.

1794
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:47,670
Hey.

1795
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:50,590
Why are you guys still waiting?

1796
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:51,290
What do you mean?

1797
00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:52,050
I made it.

1798
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:53,130
I made it.

1799
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:53,930
I cut some time.

1800
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:54,190
Go.

1801
00:45:56,050 --> 00:45:56,450
Go.

1802
00:45:57,670 --> 00:45:58,770
I can jump backward.

1803
00:45:58,970 --> 00:45:59,450
I've fallen.

1804
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:00,890
Oh my God.

1805
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:01,210
I'm here.

1806
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:03,510
I swear to God.

1807
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:04,010
Do not fall.

1808
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:04,470
Just keep going.

1809
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:05,550
I swear to God.

1810
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:06,230
Just keep going.

1811
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:07,110
I'm falling.

1812
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:08,270
I'm falling.

1813
00:46:08,270 --> 00:46:08,270
I'm falling.

1814
00:46:08,270 --> 00:46:09,590
Why do you want me to do this?

1815
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:10,770
I'm falling.

1816
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:11,610
I'm falling.

1817
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:12,250
Pull her up.

1818
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:12,870
Press space.

1819
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:15,290
I press space.

1820
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:17,050
Okay.

1821
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:19,250
Okay.

1822
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:20,030
No.

1823
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:23,390
All right.

1824
00:46:23,390 --> 00:46:23,630
Ready?

1825
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:24,490
Go.

1826
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:26,050
Okay.

1827
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:26,450
See?

1828
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:27,270
Everything is fine.

1829
00:46:27,470 --> 00:46:27,790
Go.

1830
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:29,290
Go.

1831
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:31,690
Go.

1832
00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:32,690
Go.

1833
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:33,770
There you go.

1834
00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:34,730
Now we don't need to go here.

1835
00:46:35,110 --> 00:46:37,650
I don't need to use go.

1836
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:38,850
Because it's so...

1837
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:40,170
See?

1838
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:40,870
Everything is fine.

1839
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:43,270
Go.

1840
00:46:43,870 --> 00:46:44,710
Look at that.

1841
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:46,270
We're a team.

1842
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:47,550
We're so coordinated.

1843
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:50,390
Go.

1844
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:50,750
Go.

1845
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:51,330
Okay.

1846
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:52,410
Second jump, guys.

1847
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:53,230
Second jump.

1848
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:54,470
Second jump.

1849
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:55,950
All right.

1850
00:46:56,510 --> 00:46:57,170
And then...

1851
00:46:58,010 --> 00:46:58,490
Two.

1852
00:46:58,490 --> 00:46:58,970
Go.

1853
00:46:59,070 --> 00:46:59,310
Go.

1854
00:46:59,410 --> 00:46:59,590
Go.

1855
00:46:59,830 --> 00:47:00,310
Okay.

1856
00:47:00,490 --> 00:47:01,070
This one.

1857
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:01,790
Okay.

1858
00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:03,690
Now we just go forward.

1859
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:04,090
Okay.

1860
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:04,370
Go.

1861
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:05,610
Okay.

1862
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:06,530
The next one.

1863
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:07,750
Go.

1864
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:08,370
Don't fall.

1865
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:08,950
Don't fall.

1866
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:09,230
Okay.

1867
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:09,850
Go.

1868
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:11,370
The next one is the left one.

1869
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:12,110
It's the left one right here.

1870
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:14,790
Dita, Dita, where are you pulling me?

1871
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:17,150
Don't get... You gotta save it.

1872
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:17,830
You gotta save it.

1873
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:18,490
You gotta save it.

1874
00:47:18,850 --> 00:47:19,570
I'm trying.

1875
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:21,330
I'm trying.

1876
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:21,410
Okay.

1877
00:47:21,470 --> 00:47:22,130
Try to save it.

1878
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:22,430
We'll save it.

1879
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:22,910
We'll save it.

1880
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:23,670
What do you mean?

1881
00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:25,130
Oh my God.

1882
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:27,830
What do you mean?

1883
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:29,590
That was not on me.

1884
00:47:29,770 --> 00:47:31,430
I was literally there.

1885
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:32,570
I was there.

1886
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:34,910
You two dragged me back down to hell.

1887
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:35,770
Yeah.

1888
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:35,990
Yeah.

1889
00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:36,250
Yeah.

1890
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:36,590
Yeah.

1891
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:37,250
Yup.

1892
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:37,630
Yup.

1893
00:47:37,650 --> 00:47:37,790
Yup.

1894
00:47:39,710 --> 00:47:45,810
Guys, we can't reset because somebody was like, no, we don't need baby mode.

1895
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:47,490
You think...

1896
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:48,390
Yeah.

1897
00:47:49,070 --> 00:47:49,370
Yeah.

1898
00:47:49,890 --> 00:47:52,790
You think our chat would let us play baby mode?

1899
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,910
You really think they would sign up for baby mode?

1900
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:54,970
Yeah.

1901
00:47:54,970 --> 00:47:57,190
My drag rules would let me play baby mode.

1902
00:47:57,770 --> 00:47:58,050
Yeah.

1903
00:47:58,170 --> 00:47:58,650
My drag rules would let me play baby mode.

1904
00:47:58,650 --> 00:47:59,490
No, they wouldn't.

1905
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:00,730
Read your own chat.

1906
00:48:00,890 --> 00:48:01,510
You don't know them.

1907
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:02,190
Go!

1908
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:03,850
All right.

1909
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:05,130
Use eyes.

1910
00:48:05,330 --> 00:48:05,810
Use eyes.

1911
00:48:05,910 --> 00:48:07,190
We don't need coordination here.

1912
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:07,930
Just use your eyes.

1913
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:08,570
Okay.

1914
00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:11,910
Oh my God.

1915
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:13,290
Our Pierre is not using his eyes.

1916
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:14,130
Why am I climbing backwards?

1917
00:48:14,610 --> 00:48:16,430
He's not using his eyes.

1918
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:17,170
Okay.

1919
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:19,170
Go, go, go, go, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump.

1920
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:19,650
Okay.

1921
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:20,050
Okay.

1922
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:21,230
Okay.

1923
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:21,970
Okay.

1924
00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:22,850
And then...

1925
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:24,070
See?

1926
00:48:24,290 --> 00:48:25,250
All of... This is easy.

1927
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:26,310
This one's so easy.

1928
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:26,550
Faster, donkey.

1929
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:26,990
Faster.

1930
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:27,890
What do you mean?

1931
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:29,650
I'm really faster than both of you combined.

1932
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:30,510
Faster.

1933
00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:30,850
Faster.

1934
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:32,030
Look, I took that first.

1935
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:32,990
I took that jump first.

1936
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:34,390
Faster.

1937
00:48:35,090 --> 00:48:35,490
Faster.

1938
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:36,230
Pull me up.

1939
00:48:36,270 --> 00:48:36,830
Pull me up.

1940
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:38,850
Somebody's being a fucking...

1941
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:39,350
Faster.

1942
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:40,070
Faster.

1943
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:41,150
Faster.

1944
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:41,850
All right.

1945
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:42,290
See?

1946
00:48:42,290 --> 00:48:42,830
We made it.

1947
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:43,790
Faster.

1948
00:48:44,270 --> 00:48:46,370
I don't think we need coordination for... Okay.

1949
00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:47,630
We need coordination for this.

1950
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:55,370
I don't think we... I'm dead.

1951
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:56,570
I don't think we need to... Yeah.

1952
00:48:56,630 --> 00:48:56,970
I don't think we need to...

1953
00:48:56,990 --> 00:48:58,770
I don't think we need to jump that other box.

1954
00:48:58,870 --> 00:48:59,990
We can literally skip that one.

1955
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:00,950
See?

1956
00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:01,310
Look.

1957
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:03,430
We are reading each other's minds.

1958
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:04,890
We're reading our minds right now.

1959
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:06,190
We're reading our minds right now.

1960
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:07,830
Okay.

1961
00:49:07,890 --> 00:49:09,470
You guys need to be a little bit faster there.

1962
00:49:09,630 --> 00:49:09,850
Okay.

1963
00:49:09,890 --> 00:49:10,170
All right.

1964
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:10,610
Second jump.

1965
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:11,110
Second jump.

1966
00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:11,610
Okay.

1967
00:49:12,630 --> 00:49:12,990
Okay.

1968
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:14,630
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

1969
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:16,490
Okay.

1970
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:17,550
Okay.

1971
00:49:17,550 --> 00:49:18,470
Jump on the left one.

1972
00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:19,830
Okay.

1973
00:49:19,830 --> 00:49:20,590
Jump on this one.

1974
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:22,270
I don't think we should have, but okay.

1975
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:23,030
Jump on next one.

1976
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:24,290
I don't think we should have, but okay.

1977
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:25,710
Jump on this one.

1978
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:26,490
Okay.

1979
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:26,970
Not bad.

1980
00:49:26,990 --> 00:49:27,550
Okay.

1981
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:27,950
Okay.

1982
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:29,070
I press button, we go.

1983
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:32,470
Jump, not come, okay?

1984
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:33,730
Guys, hurry up!

1985
00:49:34,470 --> 00:49:38,930
I can't get up because you guys keep fucking dragging me behind.

1986
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:40,090
What are you talking about?

1987
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:41,070
What are you talking about?

1988
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:42,170
I'm ahead of you.

1989
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:43,130
I'm literally ahead of you.

1990
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:46,330
I'm literally ahead of you right now.

1991
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:47,290
There you go.

1992
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:47,930
Okay, okay.

1993
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:48,470
See?

1994
00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:49,330
We're doing it.

1995
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:50,890
Go.

1996
00:49:51,050 --> 00:49:51,430
Okay.

1997
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:53,110
We did it.

1998
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:53,690
Go!

1999
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:57,310
Go!

2000
00:49:57,630 --> 00:49:57,730
Go!

2001
00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:00,130
Go!

2002
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:01,770
Okay!

2003
00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:03,490
Oh my god.

2004
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:04,230
There we go.

2005
00:50:04,770 --> 00:50:05,610
Everything's okay.

2006
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:07,430
Everything's okay.

2007
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:08,770
Unbelievable.

2008
00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:14,510
She's like, why are you guys pulling me back?

2009
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:15,890
No one was doing anything!

2010
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:21,170
Bitchy, no one was doing anything!

2011
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:27,250
I mean, somebody was clearly pulling me back on my stream.

2012
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:28,870
Swim?

2013
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:29,990
Uh huh.

2014
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,110
How did you guys do it?

2015
00:50:31,850 --> 00:50:32,350
Control.

2016
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:33,310
Oh, control.

2017
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:34,010
I did it.

2018
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:35,690
Okay.

2019
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:36,570
No swim?

2020
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:37,850
You did it.

2021
00:50:37,990 --> 00:50:38,430
Okay.

2022
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:39,330
Forward?

2023
00:50:39,650 --> 00:50:40,070
Forward?

2024
00:50:40,690 --> 00:50:45,350
It was somebody's ping, but it wasn't my ping because I have the home advantage.

2025
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:47,990
So you should be carrying.

2026
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:48,990
So why am I carrying?

2027
00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:53,090
I was carrying, but somebody is a fucking cement blocker.

2028
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:54,290
In my backpack.

2029
00:50:54,890 --> 00:50:55,990
Maybe it's me.

2030
00:50:56,230 --> 00:50:57,170
Why do you keep falling?

2031
00:50:58,750 --> 00:50:59,910
Maybe it's me.

2032
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:02,890
I have the true 100 LPC.

2033
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:04,910
Wait, how do you know?

2034
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:07,050
We can't see our ping here.

2035
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:12,550
How do you know?

2036
00:51:12,610 --> 00:51:13,930
Maybe the servers are better.

2037
00:51:14,310 --> 00:51:15,370
Oh, we don't have to do this again.

2038
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:16,170
Thank god.

2039
00:51:16,790 --> 00:51:18,050
Yeah, thank god.

2040
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:20,910
Maybe there's better servers and chain together.

2041
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:21,750
You don't know that.

2042
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:22,530
Focus, focus.

2043
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:23,570
Okay.

2044
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:25,850
Not yet, not yet.

2045
00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:27,130
Go, go, go, go, go.

2046
00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:31,950
I told you guys.

2047
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:33,430
Okay.

2048
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:34,810
We are going to die.

2049
00:51:35,230 --> 00:51:35,870
Wait for it.

2050
00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:38,210
Go, go, go, go, go.

2051
00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:39,730
Go, go, go, go.

2052
00:51:39,770 --> 00:51:40,370
Okay, we're okay.

2053
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:43,170
Just jump.

2054
00:51:44,850 --> 00:51:45,290
Walking.

2055
00:51:46,030 --> 00:51:46,470
Walking.

2056
00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:49,510
I'm walking.

2057
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:50,010
I'm walking.

2058
00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:51,010
Stopping.

2059
00:51:51,010 --> 00:51:51,390
Stopping.

2060
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:54,170
Okay, time it.

2061
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:55,230
Now.

2062
00:51:58,730 --> 00:51:59,250
Ducky's.

2063
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:00,870
Walking.

2064
00:52:00,970 --> 00:52:01,490
Walking.

2065
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:01,490
Walking.

2066
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:02,730
We can do this one by one.

2067
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:03,730
We don't need a...

2068
00:52:03,730 --> 00:52:04,630
Stopping.

2069
00:52:04,650 --> 00:52:05,070
Stopping.

2070
00:52:05,070 --> 00:52:05,490
Stopping.

2071
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:05,870
One by one.

2072
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:06,770
Yeah.

2073
00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:07,450
Okay.

2074
00:52:09,190 --> 00:52:09,710
Walking.

2075
00:52:10,090 --> 00:52:10,450
Walking.

2076
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:10,650
Walking.

2077
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:11,070
See, I told you.

2078
00:52:11,110 --> 00:52:11,730
One by one.

2079
00:52:11,770 --> 00:52:12,710
Slow and steady.

2080
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:14,130
Okay, wait now.

2081
00:52:14,230 --> 00:52:14,590
Wait now.

2082
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:15,570
How the fuck?

2083
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:16,070
Looking.

2084
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:16,990
Looking.

2085
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:17,870
Analyzing.

2086
00:52:17,870 --> 00:52:18,250
Okay.

2087
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:19,850
What?

2088
00:52:20,730 --> 00:52:22,870
We go this one, then the next one.

2089
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:24,790
Oh, and then we jump on that one.

2090
00:52:24,830 --> 00:52:25,890
You see that one on the right side?

2091
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:26,850
The next one?

2092
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:27,450
Yeah.

2093
00:52:28,110 --> 00:52:28,790
Right side?

2094
00:52:28,810 --> 00:52:29,390
On the right side?

2095
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:30,370
Okay, okay.

2096
00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:31,670
Go on this one.

2097
00:52:31,930 --> 00:52:32,330
Okay.

2098
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:34,130
Then we just walk.

2099
00:52:34,570 --> 00:52:35,410
We should jump.

2100
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:36,490
Go.

2101
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:39,230
Now wait for next one.

2102
00:52:39,310 --> 00:52:40,050
Which is next one?

2103
00:52:40,550 --> 00:52:41,290
Jump, jump, jump.

2104
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:43,250
It's pummel party.

2105
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:44,110
Okay.

2106
00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:44,550
This one?

2107
00:52:44,550 --> 00:52:45,230
Okay.

2108
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:48,190
Now this one.

2109
00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:48,430
This one.

2110
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:48,630
This one.

2111
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:51,690
Okay.

2112
00:52:51,690 --> 00:52:52,130
Okay.

2113
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:52,610
Okay.

2114
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:52,910
Okay.

2115
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:53,030
Okay.

2116
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:53,750
And then we... That one.

2117
00:52:53,790 --> 00:52:54,030
That one.

2118
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:54,530
To the right.

2119
00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:55,010
To the right.

2120
00:52:55,110 --> 00:52:55,490
Yes.

2121
00:52:55,790 --> 00:52:56,230
Island.

2122
00:52:56,830 --> 00:52:57,270
Okay.

2123
00:52:57,290 --> 00:52:57,510
Yeah.

2124
00:52:57,710 --> 00:52:58,150
Safe.

2125
00:52:58,430 --> 00:52:58,710
Okay.

2126
00:52:59,090 --> 00:52:59,530
Safe.

2127
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:00,750
Okay.

2128
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:01,170
Okay.

2129
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:01,350
Okay.

2130
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:03,050
And then we walk up the log.

2131
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:04,610
Don't fall off, guys.

2132
00:53:04,910 --> 00:53:05,690
Don't fall off.

2133
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:06,610
Guys, don't falling.

2134
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:07,410
Don't falling.

2135
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:07,730
Go.

2139
00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:13,530
Go.

2140
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:15,610
Don't falling.

2141
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:18,470
This is so anxious.

2142
00:53:19,450 --> 00:53:19,930
Okay.

2143
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:20,190
Ready?

2144
00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:21,030
Go.

2145
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:23,530
Oh my god.

2146
00:53:23,550 --> 00:53:24,490
There's all of us there.

2147
00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:25,130
Oh my god.

2148
00:53:25,130 --> 00:53:25,670
We trained.

2149
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:25,990
We trained.

2150
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:26,870
We're so good.

2151
00:53:27,730 --> 00:53:28,210
Okay.

2152
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:29,730
This is easy.

2153
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:30,390
This is easy.

2154
00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:31,370
Okay.

2155
00:53:31,530 --> 00:53:31,970
Go.

2156
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:32,910
Yeah.

2157
00:53:33,050 --> 00:53:33,530
Okay.

2158
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:34,210
Okay.

2159
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:35,090
Go.

2160
00:53:36,330 --> 00:53:37,350
Oh my god.

2161
00:53:37,390 --> 00:53:38,210
We all have to clap.

2162
00:53:38,490 --> 00:53:38,850
Go.

2163
00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:41,890
Double jump.

2164
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:42,450
Double jump.

2165
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:42,730
Why do it?

2166
00:53:42,770 --> 00:53:42,950
Why do it?

2167
00:53:42,950 --> 00:53:43,170
Why do it?

2168
00:53:44,610 --> 00:53:45,070
Okay.

2169
00:53:45,810 --> 00:53:46,270
Go.

2170
00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:46,910
Go.

2171
00:53:48,110 --> 00:53:48,710
Pull me.

2172
00:53:48,810 --> 00:53:49,070
Pull me.

2173
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:49,450
Pull me.

2174
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:49,890
Pull me.

2175
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:52,110
Go.

2176
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:53,950
Okay.

2177
00:53:54,790 --> 00:53:55,250
Okay.

2178
00:53:56,510 --> 00:53:56,970
Go.

2179
00:53:56,970 --> 00:53:57,430
Alright.

2180
00:53:58,630 --> 00:53:59,430
I'm not go.

2181
00:54:01,290 --> 00:54:01,750
Go.

2182
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:02,450
It's fine.

2183
00:54:02,450 --> 00:54:02,830
It's fine.

2184
00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:04,270
This one is so close.

2185
00:54:04,390 --> 00:54:05,130
This one is so close.

2186
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:06,190
We can't pull each other away.

2187
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:07,690
Go.

2188
00:54:08,110 --> 00:54:08,570
Okay.

2189
00:54:09,070 --> 00:54:10,510
And then we made it.

2190
00:54:10,570 --> 00:54:11,230
One minute breathe.

2191
00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:12,470
One minute breathe.

2192
00:54:12,470 --> 00:54:13,670
One minute breathe.

2193
00:54:13,790 --> 00:54:15,210
One out of seven.

2194
00:54:15,410 --> 00:54:16,070
One out of seven.

2195
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:17,210
Okay.

2196
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:18,650
Wait.

2197
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:20,610
How do we... We have to walk up the sword?

2198
00:54:21,850 --> 00:54:22,770
Is it the sword?

2199
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:23,110
Yes.

2200
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:23,710
Yes.

2201
00:54:23,810 --> 00:54:24,010
Yes.

2202
00:54:24,370 --> 00:54:25,830
But sword is moving.

2203
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:26,370
No?

2204
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:26,930
No.

2205
00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:27,290
No.

2206
00:54:27,290 --> 00:54:27,990
It's not moving.

2207
00:54:28,190 --> 00:54:28,490
No.

2208
00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:29,190
It's... Yeah.

2209
00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:29,550
My brain moving.

2210
00:54:30,610 --> 00:54:31,050
Alright.

2211
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:31,850
To the right?

2212
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:32,690
Right.

2213
00:54:32,830 --> 00:54:33,010
Yeah.

2214
00:54:33,010 --> 00:54:33,270
Right.

2215
00:54:33,310 --> 00:54:33,570
Go.

2216
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:35,170
Oh.

2217
00:54:35,170 --> 00:54:36,190
Oh my god.

2218
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:36,510
Okay.

2219
00:54:36,770 --> 00:54:37,210
Left.

2220
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:37,350
Left.

2221
00:54:37,350 --> 00:54:37,630
Go.

2222
00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:38,490
Alright.

2223
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:39,390
And then we walk up.

2224
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:40,250
This is easy.

2225
00:54:40,370 --> 00:54:40,770
This is easy.

2226
00:54:40,870 --> 00:54:41,270
This is easy.

2227
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:42,450
It's not... Yeah.

2228
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:43,930
No talking, only moving.

2229
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:44,990
Yeah, only moving.

2230
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:46,950
No yapping, only move.

2231
00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:49,130
Okay, analyzing.

2232
00:54:50,890 --> 00:54:52,370
Okay, we walk.

2233
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:55,990
Don't walk too fast or you'll fall off.

2234
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:56,650
Careful walking.

2235
00:54:58,490 --> 00:54:59,570
Careful walking.

2236
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:01,850
Careful walking.

2237
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:03,710
What did I just say?

2238
00:55:04,610 --> 00:55:05,210
Careful walking.

2239
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:06,790
I'm walking.

2240
00:55:07,850 --> 00:55:10,550
I feel like we've devolved into cavemen.

2241
00:55:11,530 --> 00:55:12,150
Careful walking.

2242
00:55:12,330 --> 00:55:14,370
Go, jump, back.

2243
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:14,810
I'm walking.

2244
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:16,370
We're all walking.

2245
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:19,050
We're all careful walking right now.

2246
00:55:20,210 --> 00:55:20,830
Move.

2247
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:21,890
Yeah?

2248
00:55:23,510 --> 00:55:24,630
Where are we going?

2249
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:28,410
Careful walking.

2250
00:55:28,770 --> 00:55:33,070
I don't need careful walking.

2251
00:55:33,490 --> 00:55:35,110
The aqua man.

2252
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:36,810
Swimming, ice swimming, ice swimming.

2253
00:55:37,770 --> 00:55:39,630
Okay, but like how do we...

2254
00:55:39,630 --> 00:55:40,330
Can we drown?

2255
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:42,770
No, no dying.

2256
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:44,690
We go right side.

2257
00:55:44,990 --> 00:55:45,390
Okay.

2258
00:55:45,770 --> 00:55:46,570
Right side?

2259
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:47,970
The right side.

2260
00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:49,470
Wait, what's the...

2261
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:50,130
Then we go right side up.

2262
00:55:50,290 --> 00:55:51,110
Then we go back.

2263
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:53,130
Wait, yeah, yeah, up top, up top.

2264
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:54,790
Wait, how did you guys go up?

2265
00:55:55,330 --> 00:55:56,050
Space bar?

2266
00:55:56,110 --> 00:55:57,690
No, this is dead end, dead end.

2267
00:55:58,850 --> 00:56:01,170
Why are you so bad at with mazes?

2268
00:56:01,950 --> 00:56:02,930
What is this?

2269
00:56:03,350 --> 00:56:04,170
What is this?

2270
00:56:04,190 --> 00:56:05,490
It's like ice seed for the first time.

2271
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:06,130
What are you working on?

2272
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:09,450
It's nearly 50-50.

2273
00:56:09,470 --> 00:56:10,490
How could you choose that?

2274
00:56:10,490 --> 00:56:11,390
What's the wrong 50?

2275
00:56:11,850 --> 00:56:12,850
Ditto, what are you doing?

2276
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:13,690
Ditto, press space.

2277
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:14,310
I'm doing.

2278
00:56:14,650 --> 00:56:17,690
I pressed space, but oh, you guys are too far.

2279
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:18,470
I can't move.

2280
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:19,790
All right, swim up, swim up.

2281
00:56:19,930 --> 00:56:22,410
Ditto, go up, go up.

2282
00:56:22,530 --> 00:56:24,110
Ditto, go up.

2283
00:56:24,110 --> 00:56:24,370
Come on, go up.

2284
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:24,830
Ditto.

2285
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:25,850
Ditto, what are you doing?

2286
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:28,130
All right, down.

2287
00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:30,210
And then we go up here.

2288
00:56:30,990 --> 00:56:32,530
I pressed space, but I was...

2289
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:32,690
Lying.

2290
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:33,150
Donkey lying.

2291
00:56:33,350 --> 00:56:33,790
Okay.

2292
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:35,330
And then, okay, 50-50.

2293
00:56:35,370 --> 00:56:35,850
Which way?

2294
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:37,350
I take left.

2295
00:56:37,910 --> 00:56:38,350
Okay.

2296
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:38,730
Okay.

2297
00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:39,610
And then we go this.

2298
00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:40,350
That was a dead end.

2299
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:41,790
I knew it.

2300
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:43,930
Every time you led, it gave us a dead end.

2301
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:45,590
I led us to the right area.

2302
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:46,090
Blah, blah, blah.

2303
00:56:46,090 --> 00:56:47,210
My name is Donkey Bird.

2304
00:56:47,330 --> 00:56:47,930
Blah, blah, blah.

2305
00:56:48,870 --> 00:56:50,510
Guys, guys, guys, your chains.

2306
00:56:50,610 --> 00:56:51,090
Your chains.

2307
00:56:51,330 --> 00:56:51,530
Okay.

2308
00:56:52,590 --> 00:56:52,950
Okay.

2309
00:56:53,010 --> 00:56:53,310
We're fine.

2310
00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:53,730
We're fine.

2311
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:54,570
Oh, see, there you go.

2312
00:56:54,630 --> 00:56:54,730
There you go.

2313
00:56:54,730 --> 00:56:54,770
Okay, fine.

2314
00:56:54,770 --> 00:56:55,890
I find it.

2315
00:56:56,590 --> 00:56:57,210
We did it.

2316
00:56:57,390 --> 00:56:58,970
No, I'm on top first.

2317
00:56:59,150 --> 00:56:59,690
I find...

2318
00:56:59,690 --> 00:57:00,710
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.

2319
00:57:01,070 --> 00:57:02,230
No, what did you do?

2320
00:57:02,370 --> 00:57:03,590
What did you do?

2321
00:57:04,670 --> 00:57:05,410
What did you do?

2322
00:57:05,410 --> 00:57:06,350
What do you mean, what did you do?

2323
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:08,150
What do you mean, what did you do?

2324
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:09,190
What did you do?

2325
00:57:09,410 --> 00:57:10,330
What did you do?

2326
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:13,110
What did you do?

2327
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:13,810
What did you do?

2328
00:57:13,810 --> 00:57:14,270
No, it's not!

2329
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:18,570
Doki, you swam into the fucking whirlpool.

2330
00:57:18,710 --> 00:57:19,010
No, I did not.

2331
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:20,330
It was not me.

2332
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:21,570
It was not me.

2333
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:22,470
What did you do?

2334
00:57:22,570 --> 00:57:24,310
Clip that shit right now.

2335
00:57:25,050 --> 00:57:26,610
What did you do?

2336
00:57:27,330 --> 00:57:29,550
What the fuck did you do?

2337
00:57:30,810 --> 00:57:32,510
Wait, we go in here?

2338
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:33,430
Oh no, the top.

2339
00:57:33,470 --> 00:57:34,950
It's the cars again.

2340
00:57:35,170 --> 00:57:36,290
It's the cars.

2341
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:39,770
We have to do the car again.

2342
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:44,370
Chat, chat, chat, chat, chat.

2343
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:45,450
R.P.R.

2344
00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:46,530
What did you do?

2345
00:57:46,570 --> 00:57:48,210
R.P.R.

2346
00:57:48,310 --> 00:57:48,730
R.P.R.

2347
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:53,230
She fucked up.

2348
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:55,930
What did you do?

2349
00:57:56,050 --> 00:57:57,590
Was it R.P.R.'s fault?

2350
00:57:58,670 --> 00:57:59,910
It is not R.P.R.'s fault.

2351
00:58:00,450 --> 00:58:01,990
It was R.P.R.'s fault.

2352
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:02,870
R.P.R.

2353
00:58:02,890 --> 00:58:04,030
We saw it.

2354
00:58:04,450 --> 00:58:06,890
It was her, not gonna lie.

2355
00:58:06,910 --> 00:58:08,850
You're like, I'm Doki Berry.

2356
00:58:09,770 --> 00:58:11,550
And then you dragged us down.

2357
00:58:12,830 --> 00:58:14,190
You pushed Doki.

2358
00:58:14,430 --> 00:58:15,690
Yeah, you pushed me.

2359
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:16,990
Why did you push me?

2360
00:58:18,470 --> 00:58:20,930
We worked so hard to do the maze.

2361
00:58:22,070 --> 00:58:22,750
It's clipped.

2362
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:23,850
It's clipped and it's shipped.

2363
00:58:24,030 --> 00:58:24,950
It's clipped and it's shipped.

2364
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:26,790
The whole world is gonna see it.

2365
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:28,550
It's not that far.

2366
00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:31,250
You said you're Doki.

2367
00:58:31,850 --> 00:58:32,890
No, it's pretty far.

2368
00:58:33,050 --> 00:58:34,150
I'm not Doki, what the fuck?

2369
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:36,590
It's pretty far, Ditto.

2370
00:58:36,590 --> 00:58:39,050
We did a lot of stuff to get here.

2371
00:58:39,270 --> 00:58:40,310
No, it's not.

2372
00:58:40,410 --> 00:58:41,410
It's almost there.

2373
00:58:42,870 --> 00:58:43,870
It's pretty far.

2374
00:58:44,010 --> 00:58:44,870
We have to do the...

2375
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:47,070
The thing where like...

2376
00:58:47,070 --> 00:58:49,690
The running up the thing.

2377
00:58:50,350 --> 00:58:50,830
Running.

2378
00:58:52,150 --> 00:58:53,670
One by one.

2379
00:58:53,770 --> 00:58:54,450
One by one.

2380
00:58:55,690 --> 00:58:56,170
Stopping.

2381
00:58:57,210 --> 00:58:57,690
Okay.

2382
00:58:59,530 --> 00:59:00,010
Yes!

2383
00:59:02,850 --> 00:59:03,330
Yes!

2384
00:59:03,330 --> 00:59:03,490
It's pink!

2385
00:59:04,430 --> 00:59:05,250
It's pink!

2386
00:59:07,050 --> 00:59:07,370
Okay.

2387
00:59:09,110 --> 00:59:10,370
One by...

2388
00:59:10,370 --> 00:59:12,250
This is why we do one by one.

2389
00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:13,010
Okay.

2390
00:59:15,210 --> 00:59:15,850
Please.

2391
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:19,410
Ditto, please.

2392
00:59:24,290 --> 00:59:25,390
Ditto, please.

2393
00:59:27,510 --> 00:59:28,450
It's pink!

2394
00:59:29,070 --> 00:59:29,570
Ditto, please.

2395
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:30,110
Going on this.

2396
00:59:30,370 --> 00:59:31,010
Okay.

2397
00:59:31,310 --> 00:59:32,270
It's not my fault.

2398
00:59:33,330 --> 00:59:33,970
You're right.

2399
00:59:34,050 --> 00:59:34,810
Now this next one.

2400
00:59:35,230 --> 00:59:35,910
Jump.

2401
00:59:37,390 --> 00:59:38,070
Okay.

2402
00:59:39,150 --> 00:59:41,110
Jump over the laser.

2403
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:44,690
Jump on this.

2404
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:46,630
Okay.

2405
00:59:46,650 --> 00:59:47,690
Next one we jump on.

2406
00:59:49,150 --> 00:59:49,830
Okay.

2407
00:59:50,270 --> 00:59:50,830
Yeah.

2408
00:59:50,950 --> 00:59:54,210
I wouldn't scream.

2409
00:59:55,090 --> 00:59:55,990
This one.

2410
00:59:56,530 --> 00:59:57,210
Jump.

2411
00:59:57,730 --> 00:59:58,410
Okay.

2412
01:00:00,890 --> 01:00:01,570
Casually.

2413
01:00:03,390 --> 01:00:04,330
Up here, please.

2414
01:00:04,510 --> 01:00:04,710
Okay.

2415
01:00:05,950 --> 01:00:06,470
Ready?

2416
01:00:06,810 --> 01:00:07,330
Go.

2417
01:00:09,330 --> 01:00:09,850
Go.

2418
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:11,710
Go.

2419
01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:18,890
Raises up 10 octaves.

2420
01:00:19,690 --> 01:00:20,210
Go.

2421
01:00:21,870 --> 01:00:22,390
Okay.

2422
01:00:22,530 --> 01:00:23,770
Now everyone stop here.

2423
01:00:24,050 --> 01:00:25,110
Look to your left.

2424
01:00:25,210 --> 01:00:26,830
This is where Doki fell through.

2425
01:00:26,930 --> 01:00:28,050
This hole you see above.

2426
01:00:28,730 --> 01:00:29,250
Okay.

2427
01:00:29,370 --> 01:00:29,770
Okay.

2428
01:00:29,830 --> 01:00:30,310
Okay.

2429
01:00:30,310 --> 01:00:30,430
Where?

2430
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:33,890
Where's the hole?

2431
01:00:35,350 --> 01:00:36,570
What do you mean?

2432
01:00:37,430 --> 01:00:38,030
Jump.

2433
01:00:39,070 --> 01:00:39,370
Okay.

2434
01:00:39,770 --> 01:00:40,370
Jump.

2435
01:00:42,990 --> 01:00:44,410
Come on guys.

2436
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:45,450
Jump.

2437
01:00:45,630 --> 01:00:46,830
We can do this faster.

2438
01:00:47,290 --> 01:00:47,890
Jump.

2439
01:00:48,790 --> 01:00:49,790
We're not even.

2440
01:00:49,970 --> 01:00:50,390
Okay.

2441
01:00:50,490 --> 01:00:52,110
We gotta be careful now.

2442
01:00:52,610 --> 01:00:53,210
Jump.

2443
01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:55,130
Jump.

2444
01:00:56,130 --> 01:00:56,730
Jump.

2445
01:00:56,730 --> 01:00:57,130
Jump.

2446
01:00:58,470 --> 01:00:58,990
Jump.

2447
01:01:01,370 --> 01:01:03,390
Pia stop saying jump.

2448
01:01:05,090 --> 01:01:05,610
Pia stop saying jump.

2449
01:01:05,610 --> 01:01:07,230
That is my fault that you pressed paste.

2450
01:01:09,630 --> 01:01:10,330
Right side.

2451
01:01:10,430 --> 01:01:10,610
Right side.

2452
01:01:11,130 --> 01:01:11,650
Okay.

2453
01:01:12,690 --> 01:01:14,510
This one we don't need coordination.

2454
01:01:15,070 --> 01:01:16,270
We can just walk.

2455
01:01:16,530 --> 01:01:16,930
Jump.

2456
01:01:18,330 --> 01:01:18,850
Nice.

2457
01:01:18,930 --> 01:01:19,330
All right.

2458
01:01:19,610 --> 01:01:20,130
Okay.

2459
01:01:20,150 --> 01:01:20,590
Walking.

2460
01:01:21,830 --> 01:01:22,830
Casual walking.

2461
01:01:23,030 --> 01:01:23,970
Casual walking.

2462
01:01:23,970 --> 01:01:24,210
I'm walking.

2463
01:01:25,530 --> 01:01:26,310
This is hard.

2464
01:01:26,390 --> 01:01:26,730
This is hard.

2465
01:01:28,050 --> 01:01:29,910
It's like Mario Party.

2466
01:01:30,150 --> 01:01:31,190
The Yoshi thing.

2467
01:01:31,330 --> 01:01:32,230
The Yoshi crayon.

2468
01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:35,450
Never played Mario Party in my life.

2469
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:36,090
Look at me.

2470
01:01:36,130 --> 01:01:37,250
I'm a fucking gamer.

2471
01:01:37,350 --> 01:01:37,930
Look at me go.

2472
01:01:39,710 --> 01:01:40,210
I know.

2473
01:01:40,290 --> 01:01:40,630
Stop it.

2474
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:41,030
I know.

2475
01:01:41,090 --> 01:01:41,490
Stop it.

2476
01:01:46,150 --> 01:01:46,950
I'm swimming.

2477
01:01:49,990 --> 01:01:50,450
I'm swimming.

2478
01:01:51,850 --> 01:01:52,610
I'm swimming.

2479
01:01:52,610 --> 01:01:52,890
Left side.

2480
01:01:53,050 --> 01:01:53,290
Left side.

2481
01:01:53,350 --> 01:01:53,650
Left side.

2482
01:01:53,650 --> 01:01:54,070
Left side.

2483
01:01:54,810 --> 01:01:55,570
I stuck.

2484
01:01:55,570 --> 01:01:55,910
I stuck.

2485
01:01:56,310 --> 01:01:56,890
This way.

2486
01:01:56,930 --> 01:01:57,170
This way.

2487
01:01:57,250 --> 01:01:57,470
This way.

2488
01:01:57,610 --> 01:01:58,570
Through the hole.

2489
01:01:59,690 --> 01:02:00,070
Left.

2490
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:03,610
Up.

2491
01:02:03,610 --> 01:02:03,990
Up.

2492
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:04,810
Up.

2493
01:02:05,990 --> 01:02:07,590
And then... was it right side?

2494
01:02:07,670 --> 01:02:07,990
Right.

2495
01:02:08,090 --> 01:02:08,190
Right.

2496
01:02:08,190 --> 01:02:08,190
Yeah.

2497
01:02:08,470 --> 01:02:08,850
Yeah.

2498
01:02:09,770 --> 01:02:10,150
Guys.

2499
01:02:10,470 --> 01:02:11,030
I'm still...

2500
01:02:11,490 --> 01:02:11,870
Guys.

2501
01:02:11,890 --> 01:02:12,550
Give me a sec.

2502
01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:14,790
I'm stuck in a hole.

2503
01:02:16,030 --> 01:02:16,930
Don't make me go in the hole.

2504
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:18,230
I will go in the hole.

2505
01:02:18,330 --> 01:02:19,950
I will go in the hole.

2506
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:20,730
Wait.

2507
01:02:20,750 --> 01:02:21,270
Wait.

2508
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:21,270
Wait.

2509
01:02:23,230 --> 01:02:25,910
So we go through here and then we go...

2510
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:27,730
We hold right...

2511
01:02:27,730 --> 01:02:28,510
Look.

2512
01:02:29,290 --> 01:02:29,810
Look.

2513
01:02:29,870 --> 01:02:30,390
Looking.

2514
01:02:31,090 --> 01:02:32,310
Swim into the wall.

2515
01:02:32,470 --> 01:02:33,330
Swim into the wall.

2516
01:02:34,330 --> 01:02:34,850
Okay.

2517
01:02:35,110 --> 01:02:35,630
Okay.

2518
01:02:36,050 --> 01:02:36,890
Swim with me.

2519
01:02:36,930 --> 01:02:37,330
Okay.

2520
01:02:37,330 --> 01:02:37,530
Okay.

2521
01:02:37,530 --> 01:02:38,010
Okay.

2522
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:39,210
We go here.

2523
01:02:39,350 --> 01:02:40,070
We're going here.

2524
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:40,870
We're going here.

2525
01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:42,390
We go up here.

2526
01:02:42,830 --> 01:02:45,010
And then we're safe.

2527
01:02:45,010 --> 01:02:45,230
We're safe.

2528
01:02:45,230 --> 01:02:45,650
We're safe.

2529
01:02:45,810 --> 01:02:46,410
Let's go left.

2530
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:46,910
Let's go left.

2531
01:02:48,870 --> 01:02:49,750
Oh, f**k.

2532
01:02:50,770 --> 01:02:51,210
Careful.

2533
01:02:51,390 --> 01:02:52,010
Can we make this?

2534
01:02:52,750 --> 01:02:53,190
Okay.

2535
01:02:53,290 --> 01:02:53,470
Yeah.

2536
01:02:53,650 --> 01:02:53,950
Yeah.

2537
01:02:54,050 --> 01:02:54,050
Yeah.

2538
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:54,450
Coordination.

2539
01:02:54,590 --> 01:02:54,950
Coordination.

2540
01:02:55,610 --> 01:02:56,050
Coordination.

2541
01:02:56,210 --> 01:02:56,490
Okay.

2542
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:57,130
Three.

2543
01:02:57,210 --> 01:02:57,450
Okay.

2544
01:02:57,590 --> 01:02:58,030
Two.

2545
01:02:58,470 --> 01:02:58,910
One.

2546
01:02:59,010 --> 01:02:59,410
Go.

2547
01:03:01,570 --> 01:03:03,390
Why did you guys not move?

2548
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:06,110
Because it is Discord delay.

2549
01:03:06,310 --> 01:03:07,090
What do you want from us?

2550
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:11,830
Oh my God.

2551
01:03:11,830 --> 01:03:12,550
Why did you jump?

2552
01:03:12,670 --> 01:03:13,390
None of us jumped.

2553
01:03:13,830 --> 01:03:14,670
None of us said jump.

2554
01:03:14,670 --> 01:03:14,770
I'm fine.

2555
01:03:14,770 --> 01:03:14,990
I'm fine.

2556
01:03:14,990 --> 01:03:15,670
I'm safe.

2557
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:16,290
I'm safe.

2558
01:03:16,410 --> 01:03:16,790
I'm safe.

2559
01:03:16,930 --> 01:03:17,250
Okay.

2560
01:03:17,830 --> 01:03:18,430
All right.

2561
01:03:18,430 --> 01:03:18,990
Here we go.

2562
01:03:20,610 --> 01:03:21,350
All right.

2563
01:03:21,590 --> 01:03:22,610
Are you still safe?

2564
01:03:22,710 --> 01:03:23,510
Are you still safe?

2565
01:03:24,950 --> 01:03:25,830
All right.

2566
01:03:26,690 --> 01:03:27,130
Okay.

2567
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:27,450
Nice.

2568
01:03:27,830 --> 01:03:28,690
What now?

2569
01:03:28,810 --> 01:03:29,270
What now?

2570
01:03:29,330 --> 01:03:29,770
What do we do here?

2571
01:03:30,170 --> 01:03:30,610
Wait.

2572
01:03:30,610 --> 01:03:30,890
What?

2573
01:03:30,970 --> 01:03:32,930
I think... I don't knowing.

2574
01:03:33,410 --> 01:03:34,090
Let's go slow.

2575
01:03:34,370 --> 01:03:34,830
How do we...

2576
01:03:34,830 --> 01:03:35,430
Can you crouch?

2577
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:36,370
Can you crouch?

2578
01:03:36,430 --> 01:03:36,650
Yeah.

2579
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:37,230
We can't.

2580
01:03:37,290 --> 01:03:38,250
We can't.

2581
01:03:38,250 --> 01:03:38,630
We can't.

2582
01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:38,650
We can't.

2583
01:03:38,650 --> 01:03:38,770
Yeah.

2584
01:03:38,830 --> 01:03:39,830
How do we do this?

2585
01:03:40,810 --> 01:03:41,210
Wait.

2586
01:03:41,510 --> 01:03:41,950
Oh.

2587
01:03:42,050 --> 01:03:44,610
One of us has to fall and grip the other side.

2588
01:03:44,730 --> 01:03:44,970
Oh.

2589
01:03:46,050 --> 01:03:46,750
I think...

2590
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:47,010
I think...

2591
01:03:47,090 --> 01:03:47,530
Okay.

2592
01:03:47,630 --> 01:03:48,730
But you guys stay still.

2593
01:03:48,890 --> 01:03:49,630
I'm going to fall.

2594
01:03:49,710 --> 01:03:50,330
I will drop.

2595
01:03:50,530 --> 01:03:50,910
No.

2596
01:03:50,950 --> 01:03:51,770
I will drop.

2597
01:03:52,650 --> 01:03:53,530
Get closer.

2598
01:03:54,370 --> 01:03:54,810
Get...

2599
01:03:55,610 --> 01:03:56,050
No.

2600
01:03:58,470 --> 01:03:59,290
We can't.

2601
01:04:02,970 --> 01:04:04,790
We have to swing someone.

2602
01:04:05,110 --> 01:04:06,790
Come close to me.

2603
01:04:06,890 --> 01:04:07,430
Come close to me.

2604
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:08,990
What if we just climb over?

2605
01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:11,170
I don't think we can.

2606
01:04:11,370 --> 01:04:12,130
I don't think we can.

2607
01:04:12,130 --> 01:04:12,370
Okay.

2608
01:04:12,370 --> 01:04:12,870
I'll swing.

2609
01:04:12,910 --> 01:04:13,550
I'll swing.

2610
01:04:13,590 --> 01:04:14,110
I'll swing.

2611
01:04:14,110 --> 01:04:14,250
I'll swing.

2612
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:14,510
I'll swing.

2613
01:04:14,510 --> 01:04:14,930
I'll swing.

2614
01:04:14,930 --> 01:04:14,950
I'll swing.

2615
01:04:14,970 --> 01:04:15,930
You guys stay close.

2616
01:04:16,050 --> 01:04:16,370
No.

2617
01:04:16,430 --> 01:04:17,550
You have to be on the pipe.

2618
01:04:17,610 --> 01:04:19,410
You have to be on the pipe right here.

2619
01:04:19,490 --> 01:04:19,750
Okay.

2620
01:04:19,830 --> 01:04:20,230
Okay.

2621
01:04:20,370 --> 01:04:20,770
Ice...

2622
01:04:20,770 --> 01:04:22,750
You both need to stand here where I'm standing.

2623
01:04:22,950 --> 01:04:23,750
But what if we die?

2624
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:24,510
Okay.

2625
01:04:24,870 --> 01:04:25,890
Then we're dead.

2626
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:26,590
Ice wind.

2627
01:04:29,510 --> 01:04:30,490
Why did you fall?

2628
01:04:30,590 --> 01:04:31,330
Why did you fall?

2629
01:04:31,430 --> 01:04:31,850
Please explain.

2630
01:04:32,050 --> 01:04:32,630
Docky pull.

2631
01:04:32,770 --> 01:04:33,250
Docky pull.

2632
01:04:33,390 --> 01:04:33,890
Docky pull.

2633
01:04:34,010 --> 01:04:34,030
No.

2634
01:04:34,290 --> 01:04:35,610
I can't fall.

2635
01:04:36,150 --> 01:04:36,550
Wait.

2636
01:04:36,830 --> 01:04:37,170
Wait.

2637
01:04:37,190 --> 01:04:38,010
We can save this.

2638
01:04:38,090 --> 01:04:38,870
We can save this.

2639
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:39,650
No.

2640
01:04:40,650 --> 01:04:41,050
No.

2641
01:04:42,130 --> 01:04:42,310
Oh.

2642
01:04:42,310 --> 01:04:42,670
Oh.

2643
01:04:43,230 --> 01:04:43,630
Oh.

2644
01:04:44,970 --> 01:04:45,210
No.

2645
01:04:45,210 --> 01:04:45,890
Why you just stood there?

2646
01:04:50,770 --> 01:04:52,850
Why did you guys fall?

2647
01:04:53,650 --> 01:04:54,170
Wait.

2648
01:04:56,670 --> 01:04:58,050
That was not me.

2649
01:04:58,090 --> 01:05:00,010
I stayed on the locked-in.

2650
01:05:00,050 --> 01:05:01,310
Why did you fall?

2651
01:05:01,770 --> 01:05:02,190
No.

2652
01:05:02,270 --> 01:05:02,970
I was...

2653
01:05:02,970 --> 01:05:03,790
I was pull.

2654
01:05:03,810 --> 01:05:04,690
I was pull.

2655
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:06,030
Right up here on the...

2656
01:05:06,030 --> 01:05:06,210
There is no way...

2657
01:05:06,210 --> 01:05:07,550
There is no way...

2658
01:05:07,550 --> 01:05:09,430
There is no way we actually have to do swing strut.

2659
01:05:09,470 --> 01:05:09,690
Right?

2660
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:12,790
How can we swing?

2661
01:05:13,570 --> 01:05:14,730
Well, I don't know.

2662
01:05:14,730 --> 01:05:14,950
I don't know.

2663
01:05:14,970 --> 01:05:16,070
I don't know how to swing!

2664
01:05:16,470 --> 01:05:16,990
I don't know!

2665
01:05:17,650 --> 01:05:18,650
Can we swing?

2666
01:05:20,330 --> 01:05:21,570
Alright, are you guys ready?

2667
01:05:22,110 --> 01:05:22,750
Uh-huh.

2668
01:05:24,090 --> 01:05:26,710
Okay, you guys were not ready.

2669
01:05:26,830 --> 01:05:29,710
You guys were not ready.

2670
01:05:29,710 --> 01:05:31,810
You guys were not ready.

2671
01:05:31,810 --> 01:05:33,370
You guys were not ready.

2672
01:05:33,650 --> 01:05:34,830
Doki, what are you doing?

2673
01:05:34,970 --> 01:05:36,010
Doki, Doki, Doki!

2674
01:05:36,330 --> 01:05:37,630
You guys were not ready!

2675
01:05:37,750 --> 01:05:40,910
I don't understand!

2676
01:05:41,910 --> 01:05:43,590
I can't anymore.

2677
01:05:43,850 --> 01:05:45,210
I can't anymore.

2678
01:05:45,950 --> 01:05:48,410
She's just strolling right now.

2679
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:51,730
No, she's strolling.

2680
01:05:52,550 --> 01:05:53,870
We can't make a swing.

2681
01:05:54,070 --> 01:05:54,710
Jump.

2682
01:05:56,570 --> 01:05:58,130
How is it me?

2683
01:05:58,790 --> 01:06:01,430
You guys want to pull me back though?

2684
01:06:01,510 --> 01:06:03,810
You're the one swinging off the fucking air!

2685
01:06:04,170 --> 01:06:04,190
No!

2686
01:06:04,550 --> 01:06:06,930
I don't know what you're talking about.

2687
01:06:07,830 --> 01:06:09,590
I did my job.

2688
01:06:09,590 --> 01:06:10,530
We can't even...

2689
01:06:10,530 --> 01:06:10,670
We can't even...

2690
01:06:10,670 --> 01:06:10,890
We can't even...

2691
01:06:10,910 --> 01:06:12,670
We can't even figure it out.

2692
01:06:12,690 --> 01:06:13,950
What do you mean distribute weight?

2693
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:15,030
We don't know how to do that shit.

2694
01:06:15,630 --> 01:06:16,430
It's stupid.

2695
01:06:17,830 --> 01:06:19,050
I'm not throwing!

2696
01:06:22,210 --> 01:06:24,550
RPR is just a bad IGL.

2697
01:06:25,530 --> 01:06:26,830
I'm not even IGL-ing.

2698
01:06:31,010 --> 01:06:32,930
RPR, oh no, Chido, what are you...

2699
01:06:32,930 --> 01:06:35,330
Guys, guys, guys, please.

2700
01:06:35,930 --> 01:06:38,390
Guys, guys, guys, guys.

2701
01:06:38,470 --> 01:06:38,950
Guys, guys, guys, guys.

2702
01:06:38,950 --> 01:06:38,990
I'm not throwing!

2703
01:06:39,290 --> 01:06:39,590
I'm throwing!

2704
01:06:40,910 --> 01:06:41,950
Chido's not trolling.

2705
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:43,570
It was a ping.

2706
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:50,470
Sometimes I feel like it's not ping.

2707
01:06:50,690 --> 01:06:51,050
I don't know.

2708
01:06:51,510 --> 01:06:52,510
It's a ping.

2709
01:06:53,410 --> 01:06:56,370
Okay, Dan, why don't we create a server in Asia?

2710
01:06:56,630 --> 01:06:57,410
Why don't...

2711
01:06:57,410 --> 01:06:59,470
No, no, no, no, no.

2712
01:07:00,070 --> 01:07:01,050
No, no.

2713
01:07:01,290 --> 01:07:03,430
Great ping.

2714
01:07:07,510 --> 01:07:08,950
What are you doing?

2715
01:07:10,910 --> 01:07:11,970
I'm just trying to...

2716
01:07:12,740 --> 01:07:14,450
Okay, let's not lose here, guys.

2717
01:07:14,610 --> 01:07:14,970
Let's not...

2718
01:07:14,970 --> 01:07:15,250
Go.

2719
01:07:16,410 --> 01:07:16,990
Go.

2720
01:07:19,830 --> 01:07:21,370
I went too far!

2721
01:07:21,650 --> 01:07:23,370
Pull me!

2722
01:07:23,710 --> 01:07:24,370
Pull me!

2723
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:26,250
Pull me!

2724
01:07:27,530 --> 01:07:28,650
We're trying!

2725
01:07:30,470 --> 01:07:31,790
Oh my god.

2726
01:07:32,470 --> 01:07:33,050
Jump.

2727
01:07:34,710 --> 01:07:37,210
We can literally go all the way.

2728
01:07:37,290 --> 01:07:38,330
I'm too strong.

2729
01:07:38,330 --> 01:07:38,930
I'm too strong.

2730
01:07:41,470 --> 01:07:43,190
Okay, we don't need to coordinate for this.

2731
01:07:43,310 --> 01:07:44,630
I feel like we know what to...

2732
01:07:47,310 --> 01:07:50,310
Can you like not jinx us every time?

2733
01:07:52,070 --> 01:07:53,170
We made it.

2734
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:55,010
We made it.

2735
01:07:55,010 --> 01:07:55,090
We made it.

2736
01:07:55,090 --> 01:07:55,410
We made it.

2737
01:07:55,410 --> 01:07:55,790
We made it.

2738
01:07:55,790 --> 01:07:57,270
I told you we didn't need it.

2739
01:07:57,330 --> 01:07:57,770
Second jump.

2740
01:07:57,890 --> 01:07:58,570
On two.

2741
01:07:59,970 --> 01:08:00,410
Wait.

2742
01:08:04,190 --> 01:08:04,630
Waiting.

2743
01:08:04,630 --> 01:08:05,630
We're waiting.

2744
01:08:06,610 --> 01:08:08,050
This one, this one, this one.

2745
01:08:09,090 --> 01:08:09,490
Okay.

2746
01:08:10,790 --> 01:08:11,650
And then hop.

2747
01:08:11,690 --> 01:08:12,330
Next, next, next.

2748
01:08:12,970 --> 01:08:15,130
And then hop, hop, hop, hop, hop.

2749
01:08:15,410 --> 01:08:15,950
Hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop.

2750
01:08:16,030 --> 01:08:16,810
Okay, ready?

2751
01:08:18,830 --> 01:08:19,990
Going, going, going.

2752
01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:22,950
Why are we still climbing?

2753
01:08:23,550 --> 01:08:24,870
Why are we still climbing?

2754
01:08:25,350 --> 01:08:25,990
Stop pulling me back.

2755
01:08:25,990 --> 01:08:26,570
I know climbing.

2756
01:08:26,570 --> 01:08:27,210
You climbing.

2757
01:08:27,530 --> 01:08:29,190
No one's pulling you back, dumbass.

2758
01:08:29,210 --> 01:08:29,530
You're pulling me back!

2759
01:08:29,530 --> 01:08:32,310
It literally shows on my screen that you're pulling me back.

2760
01:08:32,570 --> 01:08:33,290
No one's pulling you back.

2761
01:08:33,290 --> 01:08:34,430
You guys are dead weight.

2762
01:08:34,470 --> 01:08:35,530
You guys are dead weight.

2763
01:08:36,270 --> 01:08:37,130
Oh my god.

2764
01:08:37,430 --> 01:08:39,070
I go without you guys.

2765
01:08:41,850 --> 01:08:42,850
Nice, we did it.

2766
01:08:42,970 --> 01:08:43,430
Nice.

2767
01:08:43,570 --> 01:08:44,590
We made it.

2768
01:08:46,050 --> 01:08:47,050
This is it.

2769
01:08:47,330 --> 01:08:48,630
I wanna go right side.

2770
01:08:49,230 --> 01:08:50,530
We did it, guys.

2771
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:52,330
We did it.

2772
01:08:52,330 --> 01:08:53,450
I wanna go and...

2773
01:08:53,450 --> 01:08:55,490
bring around the room.

2774
01:09:01,010 --> 01:09:02,090
We get over here.

2775
01:09:09,690 --> 01:09:10,950
What are you doing?

2776
01:09:11,110 --> 01:09:12,530
Why are you not working as a team?

2777
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:14,390
I'm gonna do it!

2778
01:09:16,030 --> 01:09:17,250
I'm gonna run off.

2779
01:09:17,310 --> 01:09:18,090
Where's the thing?

2780
01:09:18,190 --> 01:09:19,110
You sent it the way.

2781
01:09:20,010 --> 01:09:20,830
No, I didn't.

2782
01:09:20,850 --> 01:09:21,290
It's right here.

2783
01:09:22,930 --> 01:09:24,490
See, we're almost there.

2784
01:09:25,270 --> 01:09:25,630
We're almost...

2785
01:09:25,630 --> 01:09:26,510
Alright, jump off.

2786
01:09:28,010 --> 01:09:29,510
I will fall right now.

2787
01:09:32,190 --> 01:09:33,030
Up here.

2788
01:09:34,490 --> 01:09:35,130
Pull me.

2789
01:09:35,750 --> 01:09:37,110
Pull, yeah, I pull you.

2790
01:09:37,830 --> 01:09:39,250
Wait, how is he gonna make it?

2791
01:09:39,850 --> 01:09:40,270
Actually.

2792
01:09:41,370 --> 01:09:42,230
I don't know.

2793
01:09:44,510 --> 01:09:45,030
Pull me.

2794
01:09:45,410 --> 01:09:45,790
Up here.

2795
01:09:48,050 --> 01:09:49,310
Okay, we made it.

2796
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:50,970
This way.

2797
01:09:51,850 --> 01:09:52,670
This way, this way.

2798
01:09:52,770 --> 01:09:53,490
This way, this way, this way.

2799
01:09:54,110 --> 01:09:54,770
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2800
01:09:56,550 --> 01:09:57,590
Oh my god.

2801
01:09:57,850 --> 01:09:59,510
Guys, I don't think we're gonna be able to get out of here.

2802
01:09:59,530 --> 01:10:00,510
I don't think we're gonna beat this, guys.

2803
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:04,590
I don't think we're gonna beat it, guys.

2804
01:10:05,090 --> 01:10:05,950
Well, we got out of here.

2805
01:10:06,010 --> 01:10:10,090
I think the swing time is pretty high.

2806
01:10:10,310 --> 01:10:10,410
I think the swing time is pretty high.

2807
01:10:10,410 --> 01:10:14,050
Guys, the speed run for this is 2 hours and 30 minutes, guys.

2808
01:10:14,390 --> 01:10:15,070
Guys, the speed run for this is 2 hours and 30 minutes, guys.

2809
01:10:15,070 --> 01:10:15,910
We're halfway there!

2810
01:10:16,710 --> 01:10:18,350
That's the speed run.

2811
01:10:20,150 --> 01:10:21,250
We're halfway there.

2812
01:10:21,330 --> 01:10:22,170
One hour and 4 minutes.

2813
01:10:22,550 --> 01:10:23,650
How do we swing?

2814
01:10:24,070 --> 01:10:26,050
How do we swing?

2815
01:10:26,050 --> 01:10:26,690
Swing.

2816
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:29,830
Maybe Doki go first.

2817
01:10:29,970 --> 01:10:31,670
They were strong in my life, to be honest.

2818
01:10:31,830 --> 01:10:32,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2819
01:10:32,390 --> 01:10:32,950
I'll...

2820
01:10:32,950 --> 01:10:33,870
Doki?

2821
01:10:39,270 --> 01:10:40,330
Hey, guys.

2822
01:10:41,410 --> 01:10:43,570
Can somebody pull me?

2823
01:10:45,390 --> 01:10:47,210
Only Akiya can pull you.

2824
01:10:47,610 --> 01:10:50,930
No, you can pull other people.

2825
01:10:51,310 --> 01:10:53,630
No, I can only pull you.

2826
01:10:53,630 --> 01:10:54,610
I can pull Doki.

2827
01:10:54,610 --> 01:10:56,670
Yeah, we should all be able to pull because we're open.

2828
01:10:56,930 --> 01:10:57,890
This is an open chain.

2829
01:10:57,990 --> 01:10:58,970
This is the easier chain because we're an open chain.

2830
01:10:58,970 --> 01:11:02,130
This is the easier chain because we're an open chain.

2831
01:11:03,350 --> 01:11:03,810
Okay.

2832
01:11:05,190 --> 01:11:07,410
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

2833
01:11:08,650 --> 01:11:09,550
Okay, RPR.

2834
01:11:09,770 --> 01:11:10,230
Slow.

2835
01:11:10,990 --> 01:11:11,690
Slow guy.

2836
01:11:12,630 --> 01:11:13,710
Alright, down we go.

2837
01:11:15,050 --> 01:11:15,690
I'm ready.

2838
01:11:17,030 --> 01:11:19,190
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

2839
01:11:20,030 --> 01:11:23,310
I feel like I aged 20 years playing this game.

2840
01:11:23,630 --> 01:11:23,930
I'm not gonna lie.

2841
01:11:24,010 --> 01:11:30,610
I feel like this game has taken some of my lifespan.

2842
01:11:31,490 --> 01:11:32,830
One at a time.

2843
01:11:32,970 --> 01:11:34,430
Now you... okay.

2844
01:11:35,010 --> 01:11:35,250
Okay.

2845
01:11:39,950 --> 01:11:41,950
Let Dino go first.

2846
01:11:41,950 --> 01:11:44,330
Let Dino go first.

2847
01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:45,230
No!

2848
01:11:46,330 --> 01:11:48,670
I'm not taking Dino!

2849
01:11:48,670 --> 01:11:49,190
Go first!

2850
01:11:49,730 --> 01:11:51,030
No, I go first.

2851
01:11:53,630 --> 01:11:54,650
Okay, Dino, your turn.

2852
01:11:55,570 --> 01:11:57,450
No, no, Dito, no, no!

2853
01:11:58,170 --> 01:11:59,250
Let her go first!

2854
01:11:59,430 --> 01:12:00,710
Just let her go first!

2855
01:12:01,210 --> 01:12:01,690
Please!

2856
01:12:04,870 --> 01:12:05,350
Dito.

2857
01:12:06,390 --> 01:12:07,770
Dito, Dito, you're trolling!

2858
01:12:07,870 --> 01:12:08,590
Dito, you're trolling!

2859
01:12:09,350 --> 01:12:11,630
Okay, you're both on the other side.

2860
01:12:11,670 --> 01:12:11,930
Wait!

2861
01:12:12,230 --> 01:12:12,850
Oh my god.

2862
01:12:14,790 --> 01:12:15,890
We did it!

2863
01:12:16,070 --> 01:12:16,950
We fucking...

2864
01:12:16,950 --> 01:12:18,870
We fucking did it.

2865
01:12:18,910 --> 01:12:20,570
I don't know how, but we did it.

2866
01:12:21,930 --> 01:12:22,950
Oh my god.

2867
01:12:23,750 --> 01:12:24,870
This one, this one, this one.

2868
01:12:25,970 --> 01:12:26,650
Okay, here.

2869
01:12:26,970 --> 01:12:27,850
Okay, jump, laser.

2870
01:12:28,030 --> 01:12:29,690
Laser jump, laser jump, laser jump.

2871
01:12:29,910 --> 01:12:30,270
Boing.

2872
01:12:30,850 --> 01:12:31,210
Boing.

2873
01:12:32,410 --> 01:12:33,390
This one, this one, this one, this one.

2874
01:12:34,130 --> 01:12:34,490
Okay.

2875
01:12:34,490 --> 01:12:34,850
Okay.

2876
01:12:35,610 --> 01:12:36,890
And then the sound.

2877
01:12:38,510 --> 01:12:38,870
Alright.

2878
01:12:40,310 --> 01:12:40,670
Okay.

2879
01:12:41,250 --> 01:12:41,870
It works, guys.

2880
01:12:41,870 --> 01:12:42,830
How did you do that thing?

2881
01:12:43,030 --> 01:12:44,170
It's okay in the end.

2882
01:12:44,190 --> 01:12:45,010
It just works.

2883
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:45,490
Go in!

2884
01:12:47,750 --> 01:12:48,110
Okay.

2885
01:12:48,190 --> 01:12:48,490
Okay, three.

2886
01:12:51,550 --> 01:12:51,990
Jumping.

2887
01:12:52,510 --> 01:12:52,950
Okay.

2888
01:12:54,210 --> 01:12:54,650
Jumping.

2889
01:12:57,090 --> 01:12:57,530
Jumping.

2890
01:12:57,530 --> 01:12:58,450
Okay, okay, go, go, go.

2891
01:12:59,990 --> 01:13:00,430
Jumping.

2892
01:13:00,610 --> 01:13:01,050
Alright.

2893
01:13:02,430 --> 01:13:03,010
This guy is screaming.

2894
01:13:03,730 --> 01:13:04,170
Okay.

2895
01:13:04,410 --> 01:13:05,150
It's because it's hell.

2896
01:13:05,210 --> 01:13:05,890
We're in hell.

2897
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:07,710
Of course we're going to be screaming.

2898
01:13:09,470 --> 01:13:09,910
Okay.

2899
01:13:09,910 --> 01:13:10,610
No, someone else is screaming.

2900
01:13:10,970 --> 01:13:13,190
Yeah, I know, but like, yeah, that's what I'm saying.

2901
01:13:14,170 --> 01:13:15,850
Hell is just not us three.

2902
01:13:15,990 --> 01:13:18,330
There's other people in hell, like our chat.

2903
01:13:19,210 --> 01:13:20,830
Are we like climbing to heaven?

2904
01:13:21,410 --> 01:13:23,270
Yeah, we're trying to climb out of hell.

2905
01:13:23,510 --> 01:13:25,050
We're not gonna go to heaven.

2906
01:13:25,430 --> 01:13:26,070
Wait, what?

2907
01:13:26,430 --> 01:13:27,170
What do you mean?

2908
01:13:27,170 --> 01:13:27,870
We're not gonna go to heaven.

2909
01:13:28,030 --> 01:13:28,930
Why can't we go to heaven?

2910
01:13:29,290 --> 01:13:29,730
We don't deserve heaven.

2911
01:13:29,750 --> 01:13:33,030
We just go to the hell that's like a higher level.

2912
01:13:33,530 --> 01:13:35,210
Just a higher level of hell.

2913
01:13:35,430 --> 01:13:35,570
Yeah.

2914
01:13:36,030 --> 01:13:37,910
Oh, it's like the nine circles of hell.

2915
01:13:39,210 --> 01:13:40,310
We don't deserve heaven.

2916
01:13:40,510 --> 01:13:41,230
What do you mean?

2917
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:42,150
I'm a good person.

2918
01:13:42,450 --> 01:13:42,750
No, only you.

2919
01:13:43,030 --> 01:13:43,970
What do you mean?

2920
01:13:44,690 --> 01:13:45,390
Only you.

2921
01:13:45,530 --> 01:13:47,310
The only reason why we're in hell is because of you.

2922
01:13:47,350 --> 01:13:48,430
You don't deserve heaven.

2923
01:13:48,430 --> 01:13:50,330
Yeah, you don't deserve heaven.

2924
01:13:50,430 --> 01:13:53,310
And because we're chained to you, we're forced to not be at heaven.

2925
01:13:53,790 --> 01:13:54,910
Why are we chained?

2926
01:13:56,110 --> 01:13:56,970
Pull me up!

2927
01:13:56,990 --> 01:13:57,530
Pull me up!

2928
01:13:58,870 --> 01:13:59,750
I couldn't.

2929
01:13:59,850 --> 01:14:02,190
I couldn't pull anybody.

2930
01:14:02,670 --> 01:14:03,930
Wait, land on the island!

2931
01:14:04,110 --> 01:14:04,690
Land on the island!

2932
01:14:07,030 --> 01:14:08,490
Why did you fail?

2933
01:14:11,030 --> 01:14:11,950
Why did you fail?

2934
01:14:12,890 --> 01:14:13,990
Why did you fail?

2935
01:14:13,990 --> 01:14:14,410
Why did you fall?

2936
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:16,190
See, this is why we're in hell!

2937
01:14:16,190 --> 01:14:18,710
This is exactly why we're in hell!

2938
01:14:18,970 --> 01:14:19,930
You keep falling!

2939
01:14:19,930 --> 01:14:23,070
It's because I'm chained to you guys and Ditto keeps falling!

2940
01:14:23,690 --> 01:14:25,230
I didn't fall first!

2941
01:14:25,570 --> 01:14:27,230
You fell first and then pulled me.

2942
01:14:27,230 --> 01:14:30,250
Yeah, you fell first and then you pulled Ditto down.

2943
01:14:30,530 --> 01:14:33,370
And then I couldn't do anything because we were on the log.

2944
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:37,010
Clip, clip, clip, clip, clip, clip, clip.

2945
01:14:37,310 --> 01:14:38,510
I did not fall first.

2946
01:14:38,590 --> 01:14:39,650
I did not fall first.

2947
01:14:39,690 --> 01:14:40,370
It was Ditto.

2948
01:14:40,590 --> 01:14:41,450
Ditto fell first.

2949
01:14:41,450 --> 01:14:43,330
I didn't fall.

2950
01:14:43,570 --> 01:14:44,530
I didn't do anything.

2951
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:45,530
I didn't do anything.

2952
01:14:46,830 --> 01:14:48,290
She is trolling.

2953
01:14:48,430 --> 01:14:50,210
No, you fell first.

2954
01:14:50,210 --> 01:14:51,790
You fell first and then you pulled me.

2955
01:14:51,790 --> 01:14:52,150
You fell first.

2956
01:14:52,150 --> 01:14:53,250
I saw it.

2957
01:14:53,290 --> 01:14:55,150
How could you fall?

2958
01:14:56,530 --> 01:14:57,790
That is not true.

2959
01:14:57,850 --> 01:14:58,450
You guys are lying.

2960
01:14:58,670 --> 01:14:59,730
No, we're not lying.

2961
01:14:59,890 --> 01:15:01,410
You're just in denial.

2962
01:15:01,850 --> 01:15:03,130
You're really in denial.

2963
01:15:03,130 --> 01:15:03,390
I fell second.

2964
01:15:03,470 --> 01:15:04,370
I fell second.

2965
01:15:04,930 --> 01:15:05,830
You're in denial.

2966
01:15:06,930 --> 01:15:08,550
Your Piri is wrong.

2967
01:15:10,990 --> 01:15:12,730
You fell first.

2968
01:15:13,150 --> 01:15:15,890
You fell first, RPR.

2969
01:15:16,190 --> 01:15:16,990
I saw you.

2970
01:15:17,010 --> 01:15:18,190
You didn't see it, Donkey.

2971
01:15:19,370 --> 01:15:22,830
No, you have to watch my POV.

2972
01:15:22,910 --> 01:15:23,310
RPR.

2973
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:25,310
You have to watch my POV too.

2974
01:15:25,630 --> 01:15:27,110
You totally fell first.

2975
01:15:27,190 --> 01:15:27,870
I saw it.

2976
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:29,210
I'm gonna.

2977
01:15:29,370 --> 01:15:29,590
I'm gonna.

2978
01:15:30,450 --> 01:15:31,810
What are you going to do?

2979
01:15:32,130 --> 01:15:33,010
You're chained to us.

2980
01:15:33,050 --> 01:15:33,650
You can't do anything.

2981
01:15:35,090 --> 01:15:36,130
Okay, I don't want to move.

2982
01:15:36,210 --> 01:15:36,790
You guys pull me.

2983
01:15:37,490 --> 01:15:38,670
Okay, we won't move either.

2984
01:15:39,010 --> 01:15:40,810
Okay, how do we move here?

2985
01:15:41,710 --> 01:15:42,110
Okay.

2986
01:15:43,290 --> 01:15:44,770
I'm stronger than both of you.

2987
01:15:49,830 --> 01:15:50,630
What happened?

2988
01:15:50,750 --> 01:15:51,950
Why did you say we weren't gonna move?

2989
01:15:52,290 --> 01:15:53,090
What happened?

2990
01:15:54,510 --> 01:15:55,730
We better move or we die.

2991
01:15:55,850 --> 01:15:57,290
Would you like to die or would you like to move?

2992
01:15:57,590 --> 01:16:00,310
If we die, we won't have to play this game anymore.

2993
01:16:03,210 --> 01:16:05,090
This was your idea, by the way.

2994
01:16:05,470 --> 01:16:07,030
I thought it'd be fun.

2995
01:16:07,310 --> 01:16:11,010
But I didn't realize how bad you'll be at the game, RPR.

2996
01:16:11,010 --> 01:16:12,650
You're worse than me.

2997
01:16:13,870 --> 01:16:14,430
And...

2998
01:16:14,430 --> 01:16:15,110
Oh my god.

2999
01:16:15,970 --> 01:16:17,230
You're the worst one here.

3000
01:16:17,830 --> 01:16:19,270
Am I the worst one here?

3001
01:16:19,370 --> 01:16:20,470
We have Ditto.

3002
01:16:20,790 --> 01:16:21,770
Oh, this one again.

3003
01:16:23,790 --> 01:16:25,110
He's still in pink.

3004
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:29,370
No, RPR.

3005
01:16:30,170 --> 01:16:32,530
Save it, save it, save it, save it.

3006
01:16:33,310 --> 01:16:33,870
RPR.

3007
01:16:35,030 --> 01:16:35,590
RPR.

3008
01:16:35,630 --> 01:16:36,450
That was pain.

3009
01:16:37,050 --> 01:16:37,610
RPR.

3010
01:16:38,330 --> 01:16:40,750
Land it, land it, land it, land it.

3011
01:16:42,130 --> 01:16:43,530
Oh, you're so smart.

3012
01:16:43,550 --> 01:16:45,330
Someone save me from this hell.

3013
01:16:45,370 --> 01:16:46,950
Someone save me.

3014
01:16:47,690 --> 01:16:49,550
We have to jump from here.

3015
01:16:50,390 --> 01:16:52,830
3, 2, 1, jump.

3016
01:16:54,190 --> 01:16:55,330
You jumped too.

3017
01:16:55,850 --> 01:16:57,090
I'm gonna throw up.

3018
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:03,330
I'm gonna throw up.

3019
01:17:03,330 --> 01:17:03,750
What happened?

3020
01:17:04,070 --> 01:17:05,070
Okay, I go first.

3021
01:17:05,210 --> 01:17:06,070
I go first.

3022
01:17:07,910 --> 01:17:08,550
Okay.

3023
01:17:11,010 --> 01:17:12,270
This is on you guys.

3024
01:17:12,330 --> 01:17:13,950
I volunteer to go first.

3025
01:17:14,210 --> 01:17:15,290
I even volunteer.

3026
01:17:15,470 --> 01:17:17,710
These big ones can do anything to us.

3027
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:18,170
Yeah?

3028
01:17:19,410 --> 01:17:19,890
Yeah?

3029
01:17:20,530 --> 01:17:21,010
Yeah?

3030
01:17:21,070 --> 01:17:25,050
What happened?

3031
01:17:25,330 --> 01:17:27,330
What happened?

3032
01:17:27,470 --> 01:17:29,410
Sorry, I'm just too good at the game.

3033
01:17:29,950 --> 01:17:32,030
I'm just too good at the game that nothing happened.

3034
01:17:33,290 --> 01:17:34,630
It's really hard to throw.

3035
01:17:34,990 --> 01:17:35,250
You know?

3036
01:17:35,790 --> 01:17:40,170
It's so hard to throw when I'm just that naturally gifted at that chain together.

3037
01:17:42,090 --> 01:17:44,970
You're naturally gifted at ruining your teammates mental health.

3038
01:17:45,130 --> 01:17:45,670
Wow.

3039
01:17:48,150 --> 01:17:48,710
Why?

3040
01:17:48,790 --> 01:17:49,070
Why?

3041
01:17:49,650 --> 01:17:50,210
Okay.

3042
01:17:50,830 --> 01:17:51,390
Okay.

3043
01:17:53,370 --> 01:17:55,390
Can we cut this chain off?

3044
01:17:56,830 --> 01:17:58,670
I called your fucking bluff.

3045
01:17:58,950 --> 01:18:00,750
I called your fucking bluff.

3046
01:18:00,870 --> 01:18:02,370
I wish there was a...

3047
01:18:02,370 --> 01:18:02,910
Yeah?

3048
01:18:04,590 --> 01:18:05,630
You're so dumb.

3049
01:18:07,190 --> 01:18:08,590
Get in the fucking car.

3050
01:18:11,350 --> 01:18:13,330
You have to get on it first.

3051
01:18:14,510 --> 01:18:15,490
Follow you.

3052
01:18:15,590 --> 01:18:17,290
I just follow you.

3053
01:18:17,370 --> 01:18:18,830
Yeah, we're just following you.

3054
01:18:19,310 --> 01:18:19,870
Yeah.

3055
01:18:20,090 --> 01:18:22,490
You jump down so I jump down.

3056
01:18:22,550 --> 01:18:23,690
Yeah, you're the leader.

3057
01:18:24,190 --> 01:18:24,750
Oh my god.

3058
01:18:24,750 --> 01:18:25,610
Oh my god.

3059
01:18:25,990 --> 01:18:27,290
I can't even fall.

3060
01:18:27,490 --> 01:18:28,390
I can't fall.

3061
01:18:28,450 --> 01:18:29,470
I'm too good at driving.

3062
01:18:30,150 --> 01:18:31,870
I literally can't fall.

3063
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:35,730
Oh.

3064
01:18:35,730 --> 01:18:35,990
Oh.

3065
01:18:36,890 --> 01:18:37,050
Oh.

3066
01:18:37,430 --> 01:18:37,450
Oh.

3067
01:18:38,810 --> 01:18:41,490
RPR stop reading your chat while you're driving.

3068
01:18:41,710 --> 01:18:43,350
You're not supposed to text and drive.

3069
01:18:44,550 --> 01:18:45,070
RPR.

3070
01:18:45,110 --> 01:18:47,810
You're setting a bad example to everybody.

3071
01:18:48,690 --> 01:18:48,710
Oh.

3072
01:18:49,890 --> 01:18:51,270
Don't drink and drive kids.

3073
01:18:51,490 --> 01:18:52,490
Oh no.

3074
01:18:53,750 --> 01:18:55,470
Alright, let's do this again.

3075
01:18:55,990 --> 01:18:57,570
Let's do this again.

3076
01:18:59,070 --> 01:19:00,810
Yeah, none of us are gonna troll, right?

3077
01:19:00,930 --> 01:19:01,170
Yeah, none of us are gonna troll, right?

3078
01:19:01,890 --> 01:19:02,330
Hey.

3079
01:19:03,810 --> 01:19:04,250
Whoa.

3080
01:19:06,370 --> 01:19:07,610
I feel fresh.

3081
01:19:08,230 --> 01:19:11,310
I wish there was one chain you could cut off.

3082
01:19:11,630 --> 01:19:15,170
And I would cut off a chain and let it come back to hold me.

3083
01:19:18,850 --> 01:19:19,510
Okay, ready?

3084
01:19:19,610 --> 01:19:19,990
Okay, ready?

3085
01:19:20,650 --> 01:19:21,090
Yes.

3086
01:19:24,170 --> 01:19:24,750
I'm ready.

3087
01:19:24,850 --> 01:19:25,150
You're special.

3088
01:19:26,870 --> 01:19:28,530
Oh my god, you're getting us killed.

3089
01:19:28,770 --> 01:19:30,310
I didn't get us killed.

3090
01:19:30,350 --> 01:19:31,790
This is the one that I'm better at.

3091
01:19:31,870 --> 01:19:32,750
Than all of you.

3092
01:19:33,530 --> 01:19:34,610
Yeah, cause the ping.

3093
01:19:34,950 --> 01:19:36,050
Yeah, yeah, ping, ping.

3094
01:19:36,190 --> 01:19:36,690
Yeah, yeah.

3095
01:19:36,750 --> 01:19:37,510
It's always the ping.

3096
01:19:38,150 --> 01:19:39,770
Can't blame everything on the ping.

3097
01:19:40,510 --> 01:19:41,830
Okay, let's play on my server then.

3098
01:19:41,930 --> 01:19:42,370
Oh yeah, sure.

3099
01:19:42,430 --> 01:19:43,150
Let's play on your server.

3100
01:19:43,230 --> 01:19:43,630
Let's do it.

3101
01:19:45,170 --> 01:19:45,530
Yeah?

3102
01:19:45,890 --> 01:19:46,610
She's special.

3103
01:19:48,230 --> 01:19:49,250
I said let's go.

3104
01:19:49,370 --> 01:19:51,570
If we go on my server, we lose all of this progress, right?

3105
01:19:52,470 --> 01:19:53,370
Well, that's fine.

3106
01:19:53,550 --> 01:19:55,590
We could do it all again on your server.

3107
01:19:57,450 --> 01:19:58,950
You stop bluffing.

3108
01:19:58,950 --> 01:20:00,590
I'm not gonna take your bluff.

3109
01:20:04,210 --> 01:20:05,170
Stop bluffing.

3110
01:20:05,170 --> 01:20:05,250
Stop bluffing.

3111
01:20:05,250 --> 01:20:06,110
You know you won't.

3112
01:20:06,530 --> 01:20:08,330
I will totally go on your server.

3113
01:20:08,610 --> 01:20:09,650
I'm not bluffing.

3114
01:20:09,690 --> 01:20:10,910
I'll do all of this again.

3115
01:20:11,290 --> 01:20:12,510
Just to prove a point.

3116
01:20:12,630 --> 01:20:13,830
Let's all take four together then.

3117
01:20:13,950 --> 01:20:17,450
I can leave and this lobby will close.

3118
01:20:17,950 --> 01:20:18,190
I can leave and this lobby will close.

3119
01:20:18,410 --> 01:20:18,810
Jump.

3120
01:20:21,710 --> 01:20:22,630
I'm not doing this.

3121
01:20:22,690 --> 01:20:24,930
Listen, if you leave, I'm not doing this all over again.

3122
01:20:26,530 --> 01:20:28,730
I'm not doing this all over again.

3123
01:20:28,730 --> 01:20:29,530
What happened?

3124
01:20:30,190 --> 01:20:32,230
I would do better, but you would do worse.

3125
01:20:32,290 --> 01:20:33,290
And you're already really bad.

3126
01:20:33,690 --> 01:20:35,030
Wow, okay, let's prove a point.

3127
01:20:35,770 --> 01:20:36,690
Let's prove a point.

3128
01:20:37,130 --> 01:20:38,170
We'll play on your server.

3129
01:20:39,110 --> 01:20:41,870
You're not gonna sacrifice all this progress to prove a point.

3130
01:20:41,870 --> 01:20:42,230
I will.

3131
01:20:42,910 --> 01:20:44,130
I'm gonna go to bed.

3132
01:20:44,270 --> 01:20:45,490
It's 3.30 AM.

3133
01:20:45,630 --> 01:20:48,530
I'm giving you 30 more minutes.

3134
01:20:48,690 --> 01:20:50,390
I'm giving you 30 more minutes for this game.

3135
01:20:50,410 --> 01:20:51,090
And I'm going to bed.

3136
01:20:52,570 --> 01:20:54,810
You're giving me 30 minutes?

3137
01:20:55,650 --> 01:20:58,050
Ditto's been streaming for 16 hours.

3138
01:20:58,270 --> 01:20:58,710
Ditto's been streaming for 16 hours.

3139
01:20:58,730 --> 01:20:59,790
Whose fault is that?

3140
01:20:59,930 --> 01:21:00,850
Whose fault is that?

3141
01:21:01,610 --> 01:21:02,730
Your fault.

3142
01:21:03,250 --> 01:21:06,950
How is it my fault that you're streaming for 16 hours?

3143
01:21:07,670 --> 01:21:08,770
Jump on this one.

3144
01:21:09,210 --> 01:21:10,130
What are you doing?

3145
01:21:10,130 --> 01:21:10,930
Just jump on it.

3146
01:21:10,950 --> 01:21:12,210
Stop complaining and jump.

3147
01:21:13,510 --> 01:21:14,850
I'm carrying again.

3148
01:21:15,090 --> 01:21:15,970
I'm carrying again.

3149
01:21:16,090 --> 01:21:16,990
Oh my god.

3150
01:21:19,050 --> 01:21:20,170
I'm carrying.

3151
01:21:20,510 --> 01:21:21,010
Okay, ready?

3152
01:21:22,490 --> 01:21:23,050
Go.

3153
01:21:26,030 --> 01:21:29,290
Guys, I need you guys to stop being so behind.

3154
01:21:29,810 --> 01:21:31,750
Because you're forcing me to climb.

3155
01:21:32,350 --> 01:21:33,670
I'm literally in front of you.

3156
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:34,770
I'm literally in front of you.

3157
01:21:34,830 --> 01:21:35,670
You're pulling me back.

3158
01:21:37,410 --> 01:21:38,350
You are special.

3159
01:21:38,730 --> 01:21:39,410
You are special.

3160
01:21:40,310 --> 01:21:41,470
We made it.

3161
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:42,790
RPR, you're so slow.

3162
01:21:43,190 --> 01:21:44,190
Dinah and I were in the front.

3163
01:21:45,010 --> 01:21:45,890
I'm going to jump.

3164
01:21:46,870 --> 01:21:48,830
You did not make it to the box.

3165
01:21:49,170 --> 01:21:49,790
I'm going to jump.

3166
01:21:50,330 --> 01:21:51,350
Because I got pulled.

3167
01:21:51,630 --> 01:21:52,450
Who pulled you?

3168
01:21:52,470 --> 01:21:52,850
None of us.

3169
01:21:54,690 --> 01:21:55,210
Okay.

3170
01:21:55,530 --> 01:21:56,050
Okay.

3171
01:21:56,130 --> 01:21:58,550
I got two Dalash's chained to me.

3172
01:21:58,710 --> 01:21:59,970
Are you including yourself?

3173
01:22:01,830 --> 01:22:02,670
No, look.

3174
01:22:02,790 --> 01:22:03,470
Red and orange.

3175
01:22:03,790 --> 01:22:05,410
I'm colorblind.

3176
01:22:05,530 --> 01:22:06,110
What's that?

3177
01:22:06,710 --> 01:22:07,890
Green, green, green.

3178
01:22:08,050 --> 01:22:10,350
What does green look like?

3179
01:22:10,390 --> 01:22:11,010
I'm colorblind.

3180
01:22:12,370 --> 01:22:13,170
Not red.

3181
01:22:13,750 --> 01:22:14,230
Oh, wait.

3182
01:22:14,270 --> 01:22:15,290
So you're red.

3183
01:22:17,630 --> 01:22:19,210
What kind of colorblind are you?

3184
01:22:21,870 --> 01:22:23,030
It's like you're really red.

3185
01:22:23,050 --> 01:22:24,110
I'm a rare kind of colorblind.

3186
01:22:24,290 --> 01:22:25,370
I don't remember the name.

3187
01:22:25,470 --> 01:22:27,750
Apparently one out of a million kids get it.

3188
01:22:28,310 --> 01:22:29,690
I'm not at the bottom yet.

3189
01:22:29,930 --> 01:22:30,730
I need to swim.

3190
01:22:33,630 --> 01:22:34,570
You're so special.

3191
01:22:34,610 --> 01:22:36,010
You're one in a million special.

3192
01:22:36,310 --> 01:22:37,810
Yeah, I'm one in a million.

3193
01:22:40,910 --> 01:22:41,570
Look, see?

3194
01:22:41,650 --> 01:22:42,950
We made it back, guys.

3195
01:22:43,050 --> 01:22:44,070
We did it.

3196
01:22:44,190 --> 01:22:45,710
This does not feel like an hour.

3197
01:22:45,830 --> 01:22:48,690
I feel like I've been playing this game for like four hours with you two.

3198
01:22:49,170 --> 01:22:49,610
I...

3199
01:22:52,130 --> 01:22:54,090
We've been playing for four hours.

3200
01:22:54,170 --> 01:22:56,310
I feel like this has been four hours.

3201
01:22:56,510 --> 01:22:58,390
How is this only an hour?

3202
01:22:58,510 --> 01:23:00,670
I don't understand how this is only an hour.

3203
01:23:00,670 --> 01:23:03,690
Toki, for someone who's played before, you're not very good at this game.

3204
01:23:05,370 --> 01:23:06,190
I am.

3205
01:23:06,210 --> 01:23:07,630
I'm carrying your dumb ass.

3206
01:23:08,510 --> 01:23:09,330
I am.

3207
01:23:09,330 --> 01:23:09,650
I'm carrying your dumb ass.

3208
01:23:09,650 --> 01:23:11,570
I'm literally pulling both of you guys off.

3209
01:23:11,630 --> 01:23:11,650
I'm literally pulling both of you guys off.

3210
01:23:11,650 --> 01:23:12,990
Yeah, you're pulling me?

3211
01:23:13,090 --> 01:23:13,510
No.

3212
01:23:13,910 --> 01:23:16,130
I'm literally pulling you.

3213
01:23:16,130 --> 01:23:17,090
You're the one who fell.

3214
01:23:17,210 --> 01:23:19,850
Yeah, you're the one who fell.

3215
01:23:19,970 --> 01:23:21,770
It made us restart this entire part.

3216
01:23:22,770 --> 01:23:24,450
It literally wasn't me.

3217
01:23:24,570 --> 01:23:26,470
I'm done with this gaslighting.

3218
01:23:26,530 --> 01:23:29,170
When we were swinging, you fucked up.

3219
01:23:30,490 --> 01:23:32,070
You fucked up the swing.

3220
01:23:32,490 --> 01:23:33,690
Okay, Dido's gonna get hit.

3221
01:23:33,890 --> 01:23:34,730
Okay, no, she's not.

3222
01:23:35,690 --> 01:23:36,350
I'm fine.

3223
01:23:36,790 --> 01:23:37,370
I'm fine.

3224
01:23:37,490 --> 01:23:38,450
That was scary.

3225
01:23:39,870 --> 01:23:40,670
Press space.

3226
01:23:43,370 --> 01:23:45,910
Oh my god, what the fuck is wrong with you guys?

3227
01:23:47,030 --> 01:23:48,110
That was...

3228
01:23:48,110 --> 01:23:48,970
No, I don't...

3229
01:23:48,970 --> 01:23:50,370
You know it.

3230
01:23:50,470 --> 01:23:51,310
That was...

3231
01:23:51,310 --> 01:23:52,090
Okay, me first.

3232
01:23:52,170 --> 01:23:52,670
Me first.

3233
01:23:52,890 --> 01:23:53,610
You gotta stay there.

3234
01:23:53,810 --> 01:23:54,310
Me first.

3235
01:23:54,630 --> 01:23:55,510
Me first.

3236
01:23:56,050 --> 01:23:57,130
She's gonna get hit.

3237
01:23:57,870 --> 01:23:58,430
Now!

3238
01:23:59,030 --> 01:24:01,570
Okay, Dido, you're last.

3239
01:24:01,710 --> 01:24:02,270
Come on, Dido.

3240
01:24:02,470 --> 01:24:03,850
Come on, Dido.

3241
01:24:11,850 --> 01:24:13,310
Okay, me first.

3242
01:24:13,350 --> 01:24:13,950
Me first.

3243
01:24:14,010 --> 01:24:14,610
Me first.

3244
01:24:14,670 --> 01:24:15,230
Okay.

3245
01:24:16,130 --> 01:24:16,630
Okay.

3246
01:24:17,470 --> 01:24:19,450
Okay, Dido.

3247
01:24:20,770 --> 01:24:22,010
We did it.

3248
01:24:22,170 --> 01:24:23,950
Oh my god.

3249
01:24:23,990 --> 01:24:24,750
She did it.

3250
01:24:24,750 --> 01:24:25,790
She did it.

3251
01:24:27,030 --> 01:24:28,630
She did it.

3252
01:24:30,470 --> 01:24:32,010
Oh my god.

3253
01:24:32,210 --> 01:24:34,130
We fucking did it, guys.

3254
01:24:35,990 --> 01:24:36,770
This one.

3255
01:24:36,890 --> 01:24:37,030
This one.

3256
01:24:37,110 --> 01:24:37,830
Okay, jump.

3257
01:24:38,970 --> 01:24:40,010
Pummel party.

3258
01:24:40,050 --> 01:24:40,790
Pummel party.

3259
01:24:41,990 --> 01:24:42,930
Pummel party.

3260
01:24:43,860 --> 01:24:44,610
Jump this one.

3261
01:24:44,750 --> 01:24:45,250
Okay.

3262
01:24:46,690 --> 01:24:47,830
Jump the next one.

3263
01:24:47,890 --> 01:24:48,250
Right here.

3264
01:24:48,310 --> 01:24:48,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3265
01:24:49,750 --> 01:24:50,750
Oh my god.

3266
01:24:50,890 --> 01:24:53,310
It almost looks like all three of us missed.

3267
01:24:54,090 --> 01:24:54,990
Oh my god.

3268
01:24:55,190 --> 01:24:55,810
It almost looks like all three of us missed.

3269
01:24:55,910 --> 01:24:56,630
This one?

3270
01:24:56,750 --> 01:24:57,150
Jump?

3271
01:24:57,350 --> 01:24:57,750
Yay!

3272
01:24:58,350 --> 01:24:59,190
Jump down.

3273
01:24:59,230 --> 01:25:00,070
Okay, okay, okay.

3274
01:25:00,330 --> 01:25:01,230
Calm, calm.

3275
01:25:01,390 --> 01:25:03,130
Calm down, guys.

3276
01:25:03,470 --> 01:25:05,450
We don't have to rush this one.

3277
01:25:05,810 --> 01:25:07,810
We don't have to rush it.

3278
01:25:08,330 --> 01:25:08,810
Guys.

3279
01:25:09,990 --> 01:25:10,770
Guys, please.

3280
01:25:11,610 --> 01:25:12,090
Please.

3281
01:25:12,090 --> 01:25:14,410
Who puts fucking lube on that shit?

3282
01:25:14,470 --> 01:25:15,110
You have to rush this.

3283
01:25:15,550 --> 01:25:17,490
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo.

3284
01:25:18,050 --> 01:25:18,950
Okay, okay.

3285
01:25:19,310 --> 01:25:19,730
Yay.

3286
01:25:21,810 --> 01:25:23,170
Okay, get back.

3287
01:25:23,710 --> 01:25:25,170
Okay, we're back again.

3288
01:25:25,770 --> 01:25:27,370
We made it.

3289
01:25:28,270 --> 01:25:29,410
Okay, okay, okay.

3290
01:25:29,410 --> 01:25:30,970
We're back to 500 meters.

3291
01:25:30,990 --> 01:25:32,050
No counting just going.

3292
01:25:32,570 --> 01:25:33,890
We don't need a count.

3293
01:25:33,990 --> 01:25:35,370
We can read each other's minds.

3294
01:25:35,550 --> 01:25:37,370
We've been together for so long.

3295
01:25:38,230 --> 01:25:38,750
Yes.

3296
01:25:38,750 --> 01:25:39,670
Yeah, for sure.

3297
01:25:39,830 --> 01:25:44,090
It feels like five years have passed since we started chaining together.

3298
01:25:45,470 --> 01:25:46,030
Alright.

3299
01:25:46,650 --> 01:25:48,290
We don't need a sprint, guys.

3300
01:25:48,530 --> 01:25:50,470
Time in hell flows differently.

3301
01:25:50,670 --> 01:25:52,890
So it could possibly be five years.

3302
01:25:53,390 --> 01:25:54,510
We could have, yeah.

3303
01:25:54,570 --> 01:25:56,750
Honestly, this feels like it.

3304
01:25:58,030 --> 01:25:58,590
Alright.

3305
01:25:59,330 --> 01:26:00,350
Up we go.

3306
01:26:00,690 --> 01:26:02,170
Up we go, guys.

3307
01:26:02,550 --> 01:26:03,490
Up we go.

3308
01:26:03,510 --> 01:26:04,510
Slowly, slowly.

3309
01:26:04,730 --> 01:26:05,690
Slowly, guys.

3310
01:26:05,710 --> 01:26:06,510
No falling.

3311
01:26:06,550 --> 01:26:07,170
No falling.

3312
01:26:07,990 --> 01:26:08,710
Don't fall.

3313
01:26:08,750 --> 01:26:09,850
Don't falling allowed.

3314
01:26:11,450 --> 01:26:12,530
We don't need a run.

3315
01:26:12,650 --> 01:26:13,910
We don't need a sprint for this.

3316
01:26:15,110 --> 01:26:15,910
Good aim.

3317
01:26:16,010 --> 01:26:16,910
Good aim only.

3318
01:26:17,090 --> 01:26:17,510
Good aim only.

3319
01:26:17,510 --> 01:26:18,690
Yeah, we're FPS gamers.

3320
01:26:18,810 --> 01:26:19,790
We don't fall.

3321
01:26:20,170 --> 01:26:20,810
I can run.

3322
01:26:21,350 --> 01:26:22,190
Okay, no, Ditto.

3323
01:26:22,230 --> 01:26:22,550
You cannot.

3324
01:26:23,070 --> 01:26:23,850
Don't you do it.

3325
01:26:25,870 --> 01:26:26,590
It's maze time.

3326
01:26:26,650 --> 01:26:27,150
It's maze.

3327
01:26:28,070 --> 01:26:29,110
Oh my god.

3328
01:26:29,290 --> 01:26:29,970
Look at us.

3329
01:26:29,970 --> 01:26:30,690
We're so far.

3330
01:26:30,690 --> 01:26:31,070
Oh my god.

3331
01:26:31,070 --> 01:26:31,710
We did it again.

3332
01:26:31,770 --> 01:26:32,730
We're back here.

3333
01:26:33,170 --> 01:26:34,330
We're back here.

3334
01:26:34,870 --> 01:26:38,470
It feels like a thousand years have passed since we started this game.

3335
01:26:38,710 --> 01:26:38,930
It feels like a thousand years have passed since we started this game.

3336
01:26:38,930 --> 01:26:40,810
We've been stuck here for a thousand years.

3337
01:26:41,390 --> 01:26:42,210
Up here, up here, up here.

3338
01:26:43,250 --> 01:26:44,550
I was testing you guys.

3339
01:26:44,630 --> 01:26:45,790
I knew it was up there.

3340
01:26:45,910 --> 01:26:46,550
No, you would not.

3341
01:26:46,670 --> 01:26:47,750
I knew it was up there.

3342
01:26:47,790 --> 01:26:49,550
I wanted to make sure you guys knew it.

3343
01:26:49,790 --> 01:26:51,130
Okay, we gotta hug the wall.

3344
01:26:51,230 --> 01:26:54,130
Hug the wall so RPR doesn't throw again.

3345
01:26:55,510 --> 01:26:56,450
Doki, I am going.

3346
01:26:57,490 --> 01:26:58,050
Don't worry.

3347
01:26:58,090 --> 01:27:00,410
I have a clip compilation ready for you.

3348
01:27:00,470 --> 01:27:00,990
after stream.

3349
01:27:02,350 --> 01:27:06,890
My clip combination with me is going to be like 5 seconds long.

3350
01:27:07,330 --> 01:27:09,410
I have more clips on you than you do on me.

3351
01:27:09,650 --> 01:27:10,730
3, 2, 1, go.

3352
01:27:12,090 --> 01:27:12,570
Okay.

3353
01:27:13,370 --> 01:27:15,310
Okay, this is the swing part, guys.

3354
01:27:15,450 --> 01:27:16,870
This is the swing part.

3355
01:27:17,210 --> 01:27:18,190
The swing part.

3356
01:27:18,550 --> 01:27:19,970
I think you can go first.

3357
01:27:20,050 --> 01:27:21,890
Yeah, I should be the one swinging.

3358
01:27:22,090 --> 01:27:23,430
I should be the one swinging.

3359
01:27:23,950 --> 01:27:25,410
Am I staying then?

3360
01:27:25,770 --> 01:27:26,790
Because I am middle?

3361
01:27:27,430 --> 01:27:27,910
Yeah.

3362
01:27:27,910 --> 01:27:28,370
Yeah.

3363
01:27:28,370 --> 01:27:30,830
Yeah, that's going to go great.

3364
01:27:31,530 --> 01:27:32,690
I should swing.

3365
01:27:34,210 --> 01:27:35,910
Last time you swung, what happened?

3366
01:27:35,990 --> 01:27:36,530
We almost died.

3367
01:27:36,750 --> 01:27:39,950
No, you... last time you swung, we all died.

3368
01:27:40,050 --> 01:27:41,090
I will stand here.

3369
01:27:41,950 --> 01:27:43,650
Okay, are you guys ready?

3370
01:27:44,110 --> 01:27:44,630
Yeah.

3371
01:27:44,810 --> 01:27:47,870
Okay, try to coordinate this.

3372
01:27:47,970 --> 01:27:48,530
You did nothing.

3373
01:27:48,750 --> 01:27:49,670
Okay, that's great.

3374
01:27:50,190 --> 01:27:50,710
RPR.

3375
01:27:51,070 --> 01:27:53,070
How is this my fault?

3376
01:27:53,210 --> 01:27:55,590
When she jumps, she pulls me down.

3377
01:27:56,510 --> 01:27:57,030
RPR.

3378
01:27:57,910 --> 01:27:58,270
Wait.

3379
01:27:59,030 --> 01:27:59,430
Wait.

3380
01:28:01,190 --> 01:28:01,990
Maybe we...

3381
01:28:01,990 --> 01:28:03,890
You are both dumber.

3382
01:28:04,130 --> 01:28:06,030
Oh, no, we can't.

3383
01:28:06,070 --> 01:28:06,790
No, we can't.

3384
01:28:06,870 --> 01:28:09,350
Listen, I will show you guys physics.

3385
01:28:09,570 --> 01:28:10,790
I stay here.

3386
01:28:11,670 --> 01:28:13,130
Stop pushing me.

3387
01:28:13,730 --> 01:28:14,710
Come with me.

3388
01:28:14,770 --> 01:28:15,190
Come with me.

3389
01:28:17,490 --> 01:28:18,830
I stay here.

3390
01:28:19,790 --> 01:28:21,430
And both of you jump.

3391
01:28:22,430 --> 01:28:24,450
You are not going to be able to keep both of us up.

3392
01:28:24,630 --> 01:28:25,430
You are not going to be...

3393
01:28:25,430 --> 01:28:25,990
Yes, I will.

3394
01:28:26,030 --> 01:28:26,430
Okay.

3395
01:28:26,430 --> 01:28:27,110
I see.

3396
01:28:27,530 --> 01:28:27,730
I see.

3397
01:28:27,730 --> 01:28:28,170
I'll carry.

3398
01:28:28,190 --> 01:28:28,690
I get it.

3399
01:28:28,750 --> 01:28:29,030
I get it.

3400
01:28:29,030 --> 01:28:29,130
I get it.

3401
01:28:29,130 --> 01:28:30,010
Both of you jump.

3402
01:28:30,110 --> 01:28:31,310
One left, one right.

3403
01:28:31,690 --> 01:28:32,090
Okay.

3404
01:28:32,170 --> 01:28:32,570
Okay.

3405
01:28:33,370 --> 01:28:34,170
Which way?

3406
01:28:34,410 --> 01:28:35,070
Which way?

3407
01:28:35,250 --> 01:28:35,950
I'll go right.

3408
01:28:36,030 --> 01:28:36,570
I'll go right.

3409
01:28:36,570 --> 01:28:37,210
You go left.

3410
01:28:37,270 --> 01:28:37,510
Okay?

3411
01:28:38,090 --> 01:28:38,490
Ready?

3412
01:28:39,110 --> 01:28:39,510
Three.

3413
01:28:40,070 --> 01:28:40,470
Two.

3414
01:28:40,850 --> 01:28:41,250
One.

3415
01:28:41,430 --> 01:28:41,770
Jump.

3416
01:28:44,750 --> 01:28:45,150
Yeah.

3417
01:28:45,190 --> 01:28:45,590
Yeah.

3418
01:28:45,610 --> 01:28:45,990
You see?

3419
01:28:46,070 --> 01:28:46,490
You see?

3420
01:28:47,430 --> 01:28:47,830
Mathematics.

3421
01:28:48,390 --> 01:28:48,790
Mathematics.

3422
01:28:49,250 --> 01:28:49,690
Ditto.

3423
01:28:49,910 --> 01:28:50,070
Yeah.

3424
01:28:50,470 --> 01:28:51,310
You see this?

3425
01:28:52,830 --> 01:28:54,490
I am the brain of operation.

3426
01:28:55,010 --> 01:28:55,510
Dido, we didn't.

3427
01:28:55,510 --> 01:28:56,010
Dido, we didn't.

3428
01:28:56,010 --> 01:28:56,830
Dido, we're so smart.

3429
01:28:57,290 --> 01:28:57,730
Dido...

3430
01:28:57,730 --> 01:28:58,690
Second jump.

3431
01:28:58,770 --> 01:28:59,370
Second jump.

3432
01:28:59,610 --> 01:29:01,010
Dido, we didn't.

3433
01:29:01,670 --> 01:29:02,110
Okay.

3434
01:29:02,210 --> 01:29:02,790
Second jump.

3435
01:29:02,850 --> 01:29:03,470
Second jump.

3436
01:29:03,850 --> 01:29:04,290
Okay.

3437
01:29:07,170 --> 01:29:07,970
Second job.

3438
01:29:08,050 --> 01:29:08,890
Second job.

3439
01:29:08,970 --> 01:29:09,410
Where do we go?

3440
01:29:09,610 --> 01:29:10,410
This is why I am the brain.

3441
01:29:10,730 --> 01:29:12,070
Where do we go, though?

3442
01:29:12,290 --> 01:29:13,270
This way, this way, this way.

3443
01:29:13,370 --> 01:29:13,730
Go third jump.

3444
01:29:13,730 --> 01:29:14,090
Third jump.

3445
01:29:14,190 --> 01:29:14,510
Third jump.

3446
01:29:15,090 --> 01:29:15,530
One.

3447
01:29:17,030 --> 01:29:17,470
Two.

3448
01:29:18,690 --> 01:29:19,930
This way, this way.

3449
01:29:20,090 --> 01:29:21,430
Third jump, third jump.

3450
01:29:21,450 --> 01:29:22,850
You know how numbers work?

3451
01:29:22,870 --> 01:29:23,510
They don't...

3452
01:29:23,510 --> 01:29:24,610
Third jump.

3453
01:29:24,810 --> 01:29:25,930
Number three.

3454
01:29:26,150 --> 01:29:26,750
One.

3455
01:29:27,070 --> 01:29:27,670
Okay.

3456
01:29:28,810 --> 01:29:29,410
Two.

3457
01:29:30,570 --> 01:29:31,170
Okay.

3458
01:29:32,010 --> 01:29:32,610
Three.

3459
01:29:32,890 --> 01:29:35,570
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

3460
01:29:36,070 --> 01:29:37,410
I thought two.

3461
01:29:39,710 --> 01:29:40,010
Okay.

3462
01:29:40,870 --> 01:29:42,230
Oh my God.

3463
01:29:42,530 --> 01:29:43,910
Oh my God, Ditto.

3464
01:29:43,910 --> 01:29:44,970
We're so smart.

3465
01:29:45,250 --> 01:29:45,850
Ditto.

3466
01:29:45,930 --> 01:29:46,870
We're so smart.

3467
01:29:46,870 --> 01:29:47,450
I literally...

3468
01:29:48,270 --> 01:29:50,110
Someone clipped this shit, clipped this shit.

3469
01:29:50,110 --> 01:29:51,350
Someone clipped that shit.

3470
01:29:51,530 --> 01:29:52,430
We're so smart.

3471
01:29:52,670 --> 01:29:53,790
It was my idea.

3472
01:29:53,810 --> 01:29:54,050
It was my idea.

3473
01:29:54,050 --> 01:29:54,470
Us and Ditto.

3474
01:29:54,570 --> 01:29:55,210
It was my idea.

3475
01:29:55,210 --> 01:29:57,230
Ditto and I, we figured it out together.

3476
01:29:57,830 --> 01:29:58,050
Yeah.

3477
01:29:58,610 --> 01:30:00,350
Come here, come here, come here.

3478
01:30:00,490 --> 01:30:00,650
Oh my gosh.

3479
01:30:00,650 --> 01:30:01,130
This way, this...

3480
01:30:01,130 --> 01:30:01,870
Oh, this way.

3481
01:30:01,870 --> 01:30:03,270
No, your guys' idea was...

3482
01:30:03,270 --> 01:30:07,890
Doki's idea was, and I quote, I jump, you guys wait, and then we all fall with her.

3483
01:30:08,030 --> 01:30:08,230
No.

3484
01:30:08,590 --> 01:30:09,810
Because we didn't fall.

3485
01:30:10,190 --> 01:30:10,410
No.

3486
01:30:10,410 --> 01:30:10,970
We didn't.

3487
01:30:10,970 --> 01:30:11,510
We didn't.

3488
01:30:11,510 --> 01:30:12,170
We didn't.

3489
01:30:12,190 --> 01:30:13,470
No, because we didn't fall.

3490
01:30:13,510 --> 01:30:13,830
I am the center of the wait.

3491
01:30:14,070 --> 01:30:15,170
No, we didn't fall.

3492
01:30:16,870 --> 01:30:17,570
The point was to swing, okay?

3493
01:30:18,130 --> 01:30:18,830
Somebody's coping.

3494
01:30:18,990 --> 01:30:19,610
Three, two, one, go.

3495
01:30:21,290 --> 01:30:21,870
Somebody's coping.

3496
01:30:21,870 --> 01:30:22,270
You just don't know physics.

3497
01:30:22,330 --> 01:30:23,050
And that's okay.

3498
01:30:23,090 --> 01:30:25,270
You didn't take physics in high school, and then we're going to tell.

3499
01:30:25,390 --> 01:30:26,450
You didn't even graduate.

3500
01:30:27,930 --> 01:30:29,410
What do you mean, I didn't graduate high school?

3501
01:30:29,470 --> 01:30:31,510
I went to a fucking science high school, hello?

3502
01:30:32,430 --> 01:30:33,850
My high school was math and science.

3503
01:30:33,850 --> 01:30:34,310
Where's the diploma?

3504
01:30:34,550 --> 01:30:35,390
Where's the diploma?

3505
01:30:36,130 --> 01:30:36,850
Where is it?

3506
01:30:36,930 --> 01:30:37,850
I'm not going to show you.

3507
01:30:37,950 --> 01:30:39,190
I'm not going to dox my fucking...

3508
01:30:39,190 --> 01:30:39,570
Then you didn't graduate.

3509
01:30:39,590 --> 01:30:40,650
Then you didn't graduate.

3510
01:30:42,530 --> 01:30:45,450
You probably fucking had two in fucking...

3511
01:30:45,450 --> 01:30:46,250
Or what was that?

3512
01:30:46,350 --> 01:30:46,710
Dean.

3513
01:30:46,710 --> 01:30:46,850
Dean.

3514
01:30:46,870 --> 01:30:49,310
I didn't even pass physics!

3515
01:30:49,710 --> 01:30:50,830
Do you even know what physics is?

3516
01:30:51,030 --> 01:30:51,470
I did!

3517
01:30:51,470 --> 01:30:51,610
I passed!

3518
01:30:51,890 --> 01:30:52,270
Did you?

3519
01:30:52,570 --> 01:30:53,550
Where's your proof?

3520
01:30:53,650 --> 01:30:55,070
You didn't even pass!

3521
01:30:55,090 --> 01:30:56,830
You didn't pass graduate high school!

3522
01:30:57,570 --> 01:31:00,370
The one that was shared was...

3523
01:31:00,370 --> 01:31:02,570
3, 2, 1, go!

3524
01:31:03,630 --> 01:31:05,370
Physics was my favorite subject.

3525
01:31:07,130 --> 01:31:11,670
3, 2, 1, go!

3526
01:31:13,450 --> 01:31:14,910
Okay, this is pummel party.

3527
01:31:16,870 --> 01:31:17,390
Okay.

3528
01:31:19,190 --> 01:31:19,710
Okay.

3529
01:31:20,310 --> 01:31:21,690
Just jump multiple times?

3530
01:31:24,310 --> 01:31:25,570
Who did that?

3531
01:31:25,670 --> 01:31:26,610
Who did that?

3532
01:31:26,650 --> 01:31:27,050
Who did that?

3533
01:31:27,270 --> 01:31:30,550
Who was it?

3534
01:31:31,830 --> 01:31:33,850
Now they're gonna say it was my fault.

3535
01:31:33,950 --> 01:31:34,430
It was you.

3536
01:31:35,330 --> 01:31:37,850
I went forward!

3537
01:31:37,910 --> 01:31:39,090
I went forward!

3538
01:31:39,350 --> 01:31:40,310
I went forward!

3539
01:31:41,670 --> 01:31:42,250
I went forward!

3540
01:31:42,950 --> 01:31:44,330
I went forward!

3541
01:31:44,870 --> 01:31:45,150
I went forward!

3542
01:31:45,150 --> 01:31:45,810
Me first, me first!

3543
01:31:48,910 --> 01:31:49,630
Okay, ditto.

3544
01:31:50,410 --> 01:31:51,050
Come on!

3545
01:31:52,510 --> 01:31:53,250
She's learning.

3546
01:31:55,390 --> 01:31:56,230
Me first!

3547
01:31:57,070 --> 01:31:57,550
Okay.

3548
01:32:01,150 --> 01:32:01,990
Alright, nice.

3549
01:32:02,070 --> 01:32:02,330
Okay.

3550
01:32:02,590 --> 01:32:03,070
Okay.

3551
01:32:03,850 --> 01:32:04,330
Okay!

3552
01:32:04,630 --> 01:32:05,110
Okay!

3553
01:32:05,110 --> 01:32:05,550
Okay!

3554
01:32:09,230 --> 01:32:10,790
We can just walk up for this.

3555
01:32:10,830 --> 01:32:11,530
We don't need a...

3556
01:32:11,530 --> 01:32:12,450
3, 2, 1, this.

3557
01:32:12,510 --> 01:32:14,590
We can see this and know where to do.

3558
01:32:15,630 --> 01:32:16,030
Okay.

3559
01:32:16,190 --> 01:32:17,230
Know where to do.

3560
01:32:19,350 --> 01:32:19,750
Guys!

3561
01:32:19,750 --> 01:32:20,150
Guys!

3562
01:32:20,470 --> 01:32:20,870
Guys!

3563
01:32:21,090 --> 01:32:21,490
Guys!

3564
01:32:21,490 --> 01:32:21,770
Who's pulling?

3565
01:32:22,170 --> 01:32:22,570
Guys!

3566
01:32:22,570 --> 01:32:23,270
Who the f...

3567
01:32:23,270 --> 01:32:23,890
Guys!

3568
01:32:24,470 --> 01:32:25,070
Jump here!

3569
01:32:25,070 --> 01:32:25,490
Jump here!

3570
01:32:25,490 --> 01:32:25,930
Jump here!

3571
01:32:26,150 --> 01:32:26,550
Guys!

3572
01:32:27,150 --> 01:32:28,210
What do you mean jump here?

3573
01:32:28,290 --> 01:32:29,490
How are we gonna fucking...

3574
01:32:30,330 --> 01:32:31,170
How do we go back?

3575
01:32:31,170 --> 01:32:31,810
This is a skip.

3576
01:32:32,330 --> 01:32:33,130
This is a skip.

3577
01:32:33,250 --> 01:32:33,290
There's no way.

3578
01:32:34,270 --> 01:32:35,090
Wait, I can't...

3579
01:32:35,090 --> 01:32:35,510
Just don't jump.

3580
01:32:35,690 --> 01:32:37,130
I can't... I can't...

3581
01:32:37,550 --> 01:32:38,330
I'm trying.

3582
01:32:39,050 --> 01:32:39,790
I'm trying.

3583
01:32:39,790 --> 01:32:40,790
I'm trying.

3584
01:32:42,270 --> 01:32:42,730
I'm trying.

3585
01:32:42,730 --> 01:32:43,290
What do you mean you're...

3586
01:32:43,290 --> 01:32:43,830
I'm trying.

3587
01:32:43,830 --> 01:32:43,950
Just go down.

3588
01:32:44,250 --> 01:32:45,110
Just go down.

3589
01:32:45,230 --> 01:32:46,090
Just go down.

3590
01:32:46,230 --> 01:32:47,750
Get over here.

3591
01:32:48,910 --> 01:32:50,170
I can't pull her.

3592
01:32:50,590 --> 01:32:51,110
Okay.

3593
01:32:51,110 --> 01:32:51,450
Okay.

3594
01:32:51,450 --> 01:32:51,750
Okay.

3595
01:32:51,750 --> 01:32:52,530
I got it.

3596
01:32:52,530 --> 01:32:53,690
I can't pull her.

3597
01:32:53,690 --> 01:32:54,370
Guys, please jump.

3598
01:32:54,470 --> 01:32:54,890
Jump.

3599
01:32:54,970 --> 01:32:55,310
I'm trying.

3600
01:32:55,310 --> 01:32:55,530
I'm trying.

3601
01:32:56,490 --> 01:32:58,150
I can't pull her.

3602
01:32:58,250 --> 01:32:59,210
I can't.

3603
01:32:59,530 --> 01:33:00,430
I can't.

3604
01:33:00,430 --> 01:33:01,030
I can't.

3605
01:33:01,070 --> 01:33:02,310
You can't.

3606
01:33:02,310 --> 01:33:02,850
You can't.

3607
01:33:03,590 --> 01:33:04,450
How do we...

3608
01:33:04,450 --> 01:33:05,630
What do you mean this is a skip?

3609
01:33:05,690 --> 01:33:06,150
There's...

3610
01:33:06,150 --> 01:33:07,130
This is a skip.

3611
01:33:07,230 --> 01:33:07,470
How?

3612
01:33:07,470 --> 01:33:08,490
I know what I'm doing.

3613
01:33:08,910 --> 01:33:09,750
Just come with me.

3614
01:33:11,370 --> 01:33:11,730
Okay.

3615
01:33:12,090 --> 01:33:12,450
Okay.

3616
01:33:13,070 --> 01:33:14,330
I know the devs.

3617
01:33:14,390 --> 01:33:16,270
You know the devs.

3618
01:33:16,270 --> 01:33:16,570
Okay.

3619
01:33:17,070 --> 01:33:17,670
I do.

3620
01:33:17,730 --> 01:33:17,990
I do.

3621
01:33:18,190 --> 01:33:18,510
Okay.

3622
01:33:18,550 --> 01:33:19,570
Then what do we do then?

3623
01:33:20,050 --> 01:33:20,690
Up here?

3624
01:33:20,990 --> 01:33:21,350
Yeah.

3625
01:33:21,450 --> 01:33:21,890
Up here?

3626
01:33:23,150 --> 01:33:23,510
Yeah.

3627
01:33:23,510 --> 01:33:23,910
Trust me.

3628
01:33:23,930 --> 01:33:24,590
I know the devs.

3629
01:33:24,590 --> 01:33:24,770
Come.

3630
01:33:24,930 --> 01:33:25,290
Come.

3631
01:33:26,090 --> 01:33:26,450
Yeah.

3632
01:33:27,570 --> 01:33:28,110
Up here.

3633
01:33:29,450 --> 01:33:29,810
Okay.

3634
01:33:29,870 --> 01:33:30,770
What do we do after that?

3635
01:33:32,110 --> 01:33:32,470
Listen.

3636
01:33:32,590 --> 01:33:32,770
Listen.

3637
01:33:32,910 --> 01:33:34,170
I know the devs.

3638
01:33:34,170 --> 01:33:34,930
You don't trust me.

3639
01:33:34,950 --> 01:33:35,030
All right.

3640
01:33:35,030 --> 01:33:35,690
But I do know them.

3641
01:33:37,250 --> 01:33:37,630
Okay.

3642
01:33:37,690 --> 01:33:38,250
How do we...

3643
01:33:38,250 --> 01:33:38,470
Jump here.

3644
01:33:38,990 --> 01:33:39,370
Yeah.

3645
01:33:39,470 --> 01:33:39,670
Yeah.

3646
01:33:39,670 --> 01:33:40,190
You see?

3647
01:33:40,290 --> 01:33:40,730
You see?

3648
01:33:40,770 --> 01:33:41,310
Didto did that?

3649
01:33:41,330 --> 01:33:41,390
Yeah.

3650
01:33:41,430 --> 01:33:42,030
I did it.

3651
01:33:42,270 --> 01:33:42,970
And then what?

3652
01:33:43,210 --> 01:33:43,850
And then what?

3653
01:33:44,130 --> 01:33:44,570
Pull me.

3654
01:33:45,190 --> 01:33:45,570
Okay.

3655
01:33:46,150 --> 01:33:46,530
Okay.

3656
01:33:47,990 --> 01:33:48,370
Okay.

3657
01:33:48,490 --> 01:33:49,130
And then what?

3658
01:33:51,410 --> 01:33:52,310
You see this?

3659
01:33:52,530 --> 01:33:52,910
Yeah.

3660
01:33:52,930 --> 01:33:53,170
Yeah.

3661
01:33:53,190 --> 01:33:53,550
We're looking.

3662
01:33:55,310 --> 01:33:55,690
Yeah.

3663
01:33:56,290 --> 01:33:56,670
Yeah.

3664
01:33:57,050 --> 01:33:57,430
You see?

3665
01:33:57,470 --> 01:33:58,030
One second.

3666
01:33:58,090 --> 01:33:58,410
One second.

3667
01:33:58,630 --> 01:33:59,010
Yeah.

3668
01:33:59,610 --> 01:33:59,990
Yeah.

3669
01:34:00,050 --> 01:34:00,750
You see this?

3670
01:34:00,750 --> 01:34:01,510
You got to jump.

3671
01:34:01,510 --> 01:34:02,030
Keep jumping.

3672
01:34:02,110 --> 01:34:02,650
Keep jumping.

3673
01:34:03,590 --> 01:34:04,570
Keep jumping.

3674
01:34:04,630 --> 01:34:05,310
We're jumping.

3675
01:34:05,470 --> 01:34:06,090
We're jumping.

3676
01:34:06,830 --> 01:34:07,830
Keep jumping.

3677
01:34:07,830 --> 01:34:08,590
Keep jumping.

3678
01:34:08,590 --> 01:34:09,550
Keep jumping.

3679
01:34:09,570 --> 01:34:10,010
Keep jumping.

3680
01:34:10,010 --> 01:34:10,410
I'm jumping.

3681
01:34:10,570 --> 01:34:11,130
Keep jumping.

3682
01:34:11,770 --> 01:34:12,650
Keep jumping.

3683
01:34:12,850 --> 01:34:14,470
I think somebody is coping.

3684
01:34:14,670 --> 01:34:16,190
I think we'd be at the top right now.

3685
01:34:16,270 --> 01:34:18,890
I feel like we'd be at the top right now.

3686
01:34:20,190 --> 01:34:21,750
There's an elevator here.

3687
01:34:22,090 --> 01:34:22,750
This way.

3688
01:34:23,710 --> 01:34:25,450
Maybe there's an elevator here.

3689
01:34:25,750 --> 01:34:27,330
I think the devs removed it.

3690
01:34:27,350 --> 01:34:27,950
Let's go back.

3691
01:34:28,150 --> 01:34:28,910
What are you doing?

3692
01:34:29,110 --> 01:34:29,790
Oh my God.

3693
01:34:29,790 --> 01:34:30,470
Oh my God.

3694
01:34:30,470 --> 01:34:30,690
Oh my God.

3695
01:34:30,690 --> 01:34:30,710
Oh my God.

3696
01:34:30,710 --> 01:34:31,310
They removed it.

3697
01:34:32,090 --> 01:34:33,450
They removed it guys.

3698
01:34:33,650 --> 01:34:34,330
They removed it.

3699
01:34:35,210 --> 01:34:36,170
They removed it.

3700
01:34:36,390 --> 01:34:36,970
Unlucky, unlucky.

3701
01:34:38,950 --> 01:34:40,730
They could have been back already.

3702
01:34:41,590 --> 01:34:42,730
They removed it.

3703
01:34:42,810 --> 01:34:43,650
Trust me, trust me.

3704
01:34:43,810 --> 01:34:45,930
I don't think it ever existed.

3705
01:34:46,390 --> 01:34:47,610
RPR, I don't think...

3706
01:34:47,610 --> 01:34:49,290
Do you know the devs?

3707
01:34:49,370 --> 01:34:50,250
Yeah, I know the devs too.

3708
01:34:50,650 --> 01:34:51,510
I know the devs.

3709
01:34:51,510 --> 01:34:52,250
No you fucking don't.

3710
01:34:52,290 --> 01:34:52,830
No you don't.

3711
01:34:52,830 --> 01:34:53,890
How do you know I don't?

3712
01:34:53,890 --> 01:34:54,650
You don't know that.

3713
01:34:54,910 --> 01:34:56,050
Cause they're my friends.

3714
01:34:56,350 --> 01:34:57,530
They're on my friends list right now.

3715
01:34:57,590 --> 01:34:58,150
What's your name?

3716
01:34:58,270 --> 01:34:58,650
What's your name?

3717
01:34:58,710 --> 01:34:59,470
They don't know who the fuck you are.

3718
01:34:59,470 --> 01:35:00,330
They're on my friends list.

3719
01:35:00,430 --> 01:35:00,830
What's your name?

3720
01:35:01,130 --> 01:35:02,770
That is private information.

3721
01:35:02,790 --> 01:35:03,670
Oh, so you don't know.

3722
01:35:03,730 --> 01:35:04,290
You don't know.

3723
01:35:05,590 --> 01:35:06,470
What's the first letter?

3724
01:35:06,650 --> 01:35:07,370
What's the first letter?

3725
01:35:07,650 --> 01:35:08,050
No, no, no.

3726
01:35:08,050 --> 01:35:08,770
What's the first letter?

3727
01:35:08,910 --> 01:35:09,110
You say.

3728
01:35:09,110 --> 01:35:09,690
No, no, you say.

3729
01:35:09,690 --> 01:35:10,750
I have them on my friends list.

3730
01:35:10,850 --> 01:35:11,070
You know then you say.

3731
01:35:11,130 --> 01:35:13,710
I was the one that suggested the game because the devs messaged me about it.

3732
01:35:13,970 --> 01:35:16,170
The devs emailed me and was like you should play our game.

3733
01:35:16,750 --> 01:35:17,530
What's the first letter?

3734
01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:18,190
So what's their name?

3735
01:35:18,290 --> 01:35:19,450
No, cause I'm calling your club.

3736
01:35:19,590 --> 01:35:20,370
What's the first letter?

3737
01:35:20,750 --> 01:35:21,750
No, well I'm calling your club.

3738
01:35:21,750 --> 01:35:22,590
The first letter was B.

3739
01:35:25,670 --> 01:35:25,990
Bitch.

3740
01:35:25,990 --> 01:35:26,590
Let's move on.

3741
01:35:30,350 --> 01:35:33,430
The devs are gonna ban you now because you call their a bitch.

3742
01:35:33,690 --> 01:35:34,050
Oh my god.

3743
01:35:34,310 --> 01:35:35,930
I hope they ban me.

3744
01:35:35,930 --> 01:35:37,150
I don't wanna play this shit anymore.

3745
01:35:39,870 --> 01:35:40,990
Oh my god.

3746
01:35:41,070 --> 01:35:41,690
It's so sad.

3747
01:35:45,570 --> 01:35:47,510
Okay, we go again.

3748
01:35:47,670 --> 01:35:49,330
20 minutes have passed.

3749
01:35:49,590 --> 01:35:50,810
Oh my god.

3750
01:35:50,850 --> 01:35:51,730
Only 20.

3751
01:35:52,310 --> 01:35:53,170
I'm gonna let go.

3752
01:35:56,310 --> 01:35:58,450
20 minutes have passed.

3753
01:35:58,450 --> 01:36:02,530
It feels like so many hours have passed.

3754
01:36:06,610 --> 01:36:08,970
Please, we don't need a class.

3755
01:36:08,970 --> 01:36:09,830
This was your idea.

3756
01:36:09,950 --> 01:36:10,570
How can you...

3757
01:36:11,110 --> 01:36:14,210
I didn't know how dog shit I'll be at this game.

3758
01:36:14,890 --> 01:36:16,070
You're so bad.

3759
01:36:16,250 --> 01:36:17,610
You're so much worse than everyone.

3760
01:36:17,870 --> 01:36:19,110
What do you mean I'm so much worse?

3761
01:36:19,150 --> 01:36:19,610
Look at you.

3762
01:36:19,710 --> 01:36:20,330
Look at you.

3763
01:36:21,350 --> 01:36:22,230
Look what?

3764
01:36:22,490 --> 01:36:23,830
Ditto, who's the worst player?

3765
01:36:23,910 --> 01:36:24,130
Ditto.

3766
01:36:25,010 --> 01:36:25,710
I'm going.

3767
01:36:25,890 --> 01:36:26,370
Yeah.

3768
01:36:26,930 --> 01:36:27,890
What the heck?

3769
01:36:27,890 --> 01:36:28,410
Yeah.

3770
01:36:28,470 --> 01:36:29,910
She's flying off the map.

3771
01:36:30,050 --> 01:36:30,610
While she's...

3772
01:36:30,610 --> 01:36:31,170
Oh, man.

3773
01:36:31,670 --> 01:36:32,810
Oh, I saw you.

3774
01:36:32,810 --> 01:36:34,570
She's calling my name while she's flying off the map.

3775
01:36:36,130 --> 01:36:37,130
I'm going without you guys.

3776
01:36:37,290 --> 01:36:38,630
No, I got there first.

3777
01:36:39,350 --> 01:36:41,330
I would touch this laser right now.

3778
01:36:41,730 --> 01:36:42,250
JK.

3779
01:36:44,030 --> 01:36:45,570
Jump over to this one.

3780
01:36:51,150 --> 01:36:52,770
Are you guys kidding me?

3781
01:36:53,150 --> 01:36:54,630
Okay, I'm pulling.

3782
01:36:54,870 --> 01:36:55,230
I'm pulling.

3783
01:36:56,570 --> 01:36:57,370
I'm pulling.

3784
01:36:57,370 --> 01:36:58,270
I'm going, I'm going.

3785
01:36:58,310 --> 01:36:59,410
I go too, I go too.

3786
01:36:59,590 --> 01:37:01,110
We have to do the logs again.

3787
01:37:01,250 --> 01:37:02,750
We have to do the logs.

3788
01:37:03,890 --> 01:37:07,010
Oh my god, not this one.

3789
01:37:08,250 --> 01:37:08,730
Okay.

3790
01:37:09,810 --> 01:37:10,790
Alright, here we go.

3791
01:37:12,090 --> 01:37:12,570
Jump.

3792
01:37:14,250 --> 01:37:15,810
Alright, we're getting better.

3793
01:37:15,910 --> 01:37:17,430
We're doing this so many times.

3794
01:37:17,550 --> 01:37:18,210
We're getting better.

3795
01:37:18,890 --> 01:37:20,710
Yeah, we did this 12 times already.

3796
01:37:20,830 --> 01:37:21,630
Of course we'll do this.

3797
01:37:22,670 --> 01:37:23,970
We weren't good.

3798
01:37:24,590 --> 01:37:25,550
It'll be sad.

3799
01:37:26,810 --> 01:37:27,290
Please.

3800
01:37:27,290 --> 01:37:29,110
I know, I heard there's a city.

3801
01:37:29,430 --> 01:37:31,190
There's a city above us.

3802
01:37:31,310 --> 01:37:33,490
Please, I want to see the city.

3803
01:37:33,550 --> 01:37:34,350
We're not seeing the city.

3804
01:37:34,950 --> 01:37:36,430
I want to see the city.

3805
01:37:37,130 --> 01:37:39,690
I don't want to be in hell anymore.

3806
01:37:41,290 --> 01:37:42,010
Hell's nice.

3807
01:37:42,130 --> 01:37:43,050
It's nice and warm.

3808
01:37:43,270 --> 01:37:43,890
It's like summer.

3809
01:37:44,210 --> 01:37:44,850
I know.

3810
01:37:44,910 --> 01:37:46,190
I want it to be cold.

3811
01:37:48,030 --> 01:37:49,050
You like cold?

3812
01:37:49,210 --> 01:37:50,790
Yeah, because it's not human.

3813
01:37:51,030 --> 01:37:53,590
That's the worst part about it being warm.

3814
01:37:53,770 --> 01:37:54,630
It's because it's...

3815
01:37:55,550 --> 01:37:57,870
Oh my god, you did this to us.

3816
01:37:57,870 --> 01:37:59,430
You did... I watched you do it.

3817
01:37:59,630 --> 01:38:00,050
Why didn't you pull me up?

3818
01:38:00,050 --> 01:38:01,710
Why didn't you pull me up?

3819
01:38:01,710 --> 01:38:01,910
What do you mean?

3820
01:38:01,930 --> 01:38:03,930
Why didn't you pull me up?

3821
01:38:04,010 --> 01:38:06,550
Why didn't you pull me up?

3822
01:38:06,550 --> 01:38:08,930
You distracted me with conversations.

3823
01:38:09,770 --> 01:38:10,910
I got distracted.

3824
01:38:10,950 --> 01:38:13,070
You started the conversation.

3825
01:38:13,910 --> 01:38:15,310
You started the conversation.

3826
01:38:15,310 --> 01:38:17,190
Why didn't you give me a conversation?

3827
01:38:18,030 --> 01:38:20,170
I was thinking about the cold.

3828
01:38:20,490 --> 01:38:22,270
I was thinking about winter.

3829
01:38:24,190 --> 01:38:24,790
I was thinking about the cold.

3830
01:38:24,790 --> 01:38:24,790
I was thinking about winter.

3831
01:38:24,790 --> 01:38:32,370
She starts the conversation, then she falls off, and then she blames me for starting the conversation and distracting her.

3832
01:38:32,930 --> 01:38:33,530
Stop!

3833
01:38:33,530 --> 01:38:34,370
You don't know.

3834
01:38:37,010 --> 01:38:39,310
Why didn't you pull me up?

3835
01:38:39,570 --> 01:38:41,510
Why didn't you pull me up?

3836
01:38:41,510 --> 01:38:43,270
Why didn't you pull me up?

3837
01:38:43,470 --> 01:38:45,250
I can't take this anymore.

3838
01:38:45,370 --> 01:38:46,850
I can't anymore.

3839
01:38:47,850 --> 01:38:49,250
Fall off right now.

3840
01:38:50,050 --> 01:38:50,990
Fall off right now.

3841
01:38:51,110 --> 01:38:51,890
Do it.

3842
01:38:52,270 --> 01:38:53,590
Come on, do it, you pussy.

3843
01:38:54,150 --> 01:38:55,150
Do it, you pussy.

3844
01:38:55,190 --> 01:38:56,230
Fall off right now.

3845
01:38:56,710 --> 01:38:57,290
Fall off.

3846
01:38:58,590 --> 01:38:59,510
Oh my god.

3847
01:39:00,610 --> 01:39:01,910
Oh my god.

3848
01:39:02,010 --> 01:39:02,770
This is torture.

3849
01:39:02,770 --> 01:39:03,190
This is torture.

3850
01:39:03,190 --> 01:39:04,290
You're not even a gamer.

3851
01:39:04,470 --> 01:39:07,890
You beat only up, but you can't even beat chain together.

3852
01:39:08,590 --> 01:39:09,530
That's so sad.

3853
01:39:09,630 --> 01:39:10,030
You didn't even beat only up.

3854
01:39:10,050 --> 01:39:10,630
You didn't even beat only up.

3855
01:39:10,890 --> 01:39:11,430
I did.

3856
01:39:11,770 --> 01:39:12,670
I did.

3857
01:39:12,710 --> 01:39:14,690
It's how my VODs got deleted.

3858
01:39:17,490 --> 01:39:17,890
No, I didn't.

3859
01:39:17,890 --> 01:39:17,890
I didn't.

3860
01:39:18,390 --> 01:39:19,870
Spies from Doki's chat.

3861
01:39:20,010 --> 01:39:22,170
Come in my chat and tell me if you should beat only up.

3862
01:39:22,170 --> 01:39:22,250
No, I didn't.

3863
01:39:22,250 --> 01:39:22,550
I didn't beat only up or not.

3864
01:39:29,110 --> 01:39:30,450
It's not my fault.

3865
01:39:34,210 --> 01:39:35,470
I beat it.

3866
01:39:37,890 --> 01:39:39,330
She didn't beat shit.

3867
01:39:40,570 --> 01:39:41,490
I did.

3868
01:39:42,550 --> 01:39:45,190
I bet that person's not even a member.

3869
01:39:45,590 --> 01:39:48,350
I did it in a member stream, so they missed out.

3870
01:39:48,610 --> 01:39:50,070
They missed out.

3871
01:39:50,070 --> 01:39:52,650
She did not, in fact, beat it.

3872
01:39:52,790 --> 01:39:53,050
Yeah.

3873
01:39:53,250 --> 01:39:55,270
I showed her membership right now.

3874
01:39:55,270 --> 01:39:56,830
It was in a member stream.

3875
01:39:58,130 --> 01:39:59,930
Member stream, my ass.

3876
01:40:00,430 --> 01:40:02,290
It was in a member stream.

3877
01:40:02,830 --> 01:40:05,730
Member since day one, she didn't beat shit.

3878
01:40:05,930 --> 01:40:07,410
So it's member since day one.

3879
01:40:07,410 --> 01:40:08,670
Why is it calling him out?

3880
01:40:08,790 --> 01:40:10,230
I'll recognize the name.

3881
01:40:10,430 --> 01:40:11,330
What's the name?

3882
01:40:11,630 --> 01:40:11,850
Wait.

3883
01:40:12,590 --> 01:40:14,490
Did Doggy play Olios?

3884
01:40:14,870 --> 01:40:15,650
I don't snitch.

3885
01:40:15,710 --> 01:40:16,490
Yeah, I did.

3886
01:40:16,610 --> 01:40:17,270
I don't snitch.

3887
01:40:17,470 --> 01:40:18,510
And I beat it.

3888
01:40:18,510 --> 01:40:19,670
You beat it too, right, Ditto?

3889
01:40:20,370 --> 01:40:21,450
Yeah, I beat it.

3890
01:40:21,550 --> 01:40:21,810
Yeah.

3891
01:40:21,930 --> 01:40:23,270
So we all beat it.

3892
01:40:23,290 --> 01:40:25,090
So why can't RPR beat this game?

3893
01:40:25,450 --> 01:40:28,090
You did not beat only up and I don't snitch.

3894
01:40:29,390 --> 01:40:30,270
Then you're lying.

3895
01:40:30,550 --> 01:40:32,310
You could be making it up right now.

3896
01:40:33,450 --> 01:40:36,450
See, in my stream, I was member and I saw it.

3897
01:40:36,670 --> 01:40:38,610
People in my stream were like, I was member.

3898
01:40:38,910 --> 01:40:39,390
I've been...

3899
01:40:39,390 --> 01:40:40,550
Let me read this.

3900
01:40:40,690 --> 01:40:43,630
I've been watching Doggy POV this whole time.

3901
01:40:43,690 --> 01:40:45,790
Literally 90% of the polls are her fault.

3902
01:40:45,790 --> 01:40:46,870
That's not true.

3903
01:40:47,050 --> 01:40:48,290
That's not true.

3904
01:40:48,330 --> 01:40:48,490
That's not true.

3905
01:40:48,510 --> 01:40:50,230
That person, I bet...

3906
01:40:50,230 --> 01:40:50,650
Yeah.

3907
01:40:52,950 --> 01:40:53,830
Oh my God.

3908
01:40:53,890 --> 01:40:54,610
Oh my God.

3909
01:40:54,650 --> 01:40:55,470
Oh my God.

3910
01:40:55,770 --> 01:40:56,270
Oh my God.

3911
01:40:59,910 --> 01:41:00,350
See,

3912
01:41:03,450 --> 01:41:04,190
I'm ahead of you guys.

3913
01:41:05,930 --> 01:41:06,370
Oh my God.

3914
01:41:06,370 --> 01:41:07,410
Yeah, and you're gonna get a skill as well.

3915
01:41:13,790 --> 01:41:14,670
It worked.

3916
01:41:14,710 --> 01:41:17,210
She made that message up, by the way.

3917
01:41:18,870 --> 01:41:20,390
You're getting exposed.

3918
01:41:20,550 --> 01:41:22,270
Made one message up.

3919
01:41:22,370 --> 01:41:23,150
Wait, what?

3920
01:41:23,150 --> 01:41:25,750
The one you quote unquote read from your chat?

3921
01:41:26,170 --> 01:41:27,510
That's not true.

3922
01:41:27,730 --> 01:41:30,090
I literally looked at that message.

3923
01:41:31,070 --> 01:41:33,130
I remember the guy's username.

3924
01:41:33,150 --> 01:41:34,390
It was Wario.

3925
01:41:34,550 --> 01:41:35,590
It was Wario.

3926
01:41:35,630 --> 01:41:36,510
He exists.

3927
01:41:37,190 --> 01:41:39,270
He's a real person in my chat.

3928
01:41:39,550 --> 01:41:40,230
What's his name?

3929
01:41:40,230 --> 01:41:40,550
What's his name?

3930
01:41:40,590 --> 01:41:40,930
Wario.

3931
01:41:40,930 --> 01:41:41,210
What's his name?

3932
01:41:41,210 --> 01:41:41,430
Wario.

3933
01:41:41,470 --> 01:41:42,770
W-I-R-Y-O.

3934
01:41:42,970 --> 01:41:44,150
I literally saw it.

3935
01:41:44,170 --> 01:41:44,670
Not real.

3936
01:41:44,950 --> 01:41:45,070
Not real.

3937
01:41:45,070 --> 01:41:46,150
You're not real.

3938
01:41:46,270 --> 01:41:47,010
You're not real.

3939
01:41:47,010 --> 01:41:47,990
And you made me fall.

3940
01:41:48,090 --> 01:41:49,990
Not real plus L plus Rapalzo.

3941
01:41:50,230 --> 01:41:50,390
That's on you.

3942
01:41:50,390 --> 01:41:50,750
That's on you.

3943
01:41:50,810 --> 01:41:53,430
It's your fault that you're fucking terrible at video games other than Apex.

3944
01:41:55,170 --> 01:41:57,370
You're literally terrible at any game.

3945
01:41:59,090 --> 01:42:03,510
I'm a fucking multi-talented, multi-titled professional gamer.

3946
01:42:04,050 --> 01:42:05,270
In one game.

3947
01:42:05,330 --> 01:42:05,530
Yeah?

3948
01:42:05,650 --> 01:42:06,930
You're washed now.

3949
01:42:07,270 --> 01:42:09,170
I've competed for 17 years.

3950
01:42:09,730 --> 01:42:12,170
I've been competing before you knew what a PC was.

3951
01:42:12,530 --> 01:42:13,390
Stop rolling.

3952
01:42:13,810 --> 01:42:14,950
You're playing a Zelda.

3953
01:42:15,250 --> 01:42:15,830
You again.

3954
01:42:15,910 --> 01:42:16,830
It was you again.

3955
01:42:16,830 --> 01:42:18,770
You can't handle this anymore.

3956
01:42:19,030 --> 01:42:19,410
This is...

3957
01:42:19,410 --> 01:42:20,270
This is...

3958
01:42:20,270 --> 01:42:20,630
This is...

3959
01:42:20,630 --> 01:42:20,810
Say it.

3960
01:42:22,610 --> 01:42:23,770
R.P.I.

3961
01:42:23,770 --> 01:42:24,890
Why is this even...

3962
01:42:24,890 --> 01:42:26,890
Why do you keep having these conversations with me?

3963
01:42:26,950 --> 01:42:27,570
I can't focus.

3964
01:42:28,030 --> 01:42:29,070
I can't focus at all.

3965
01:42:29,070 --> 01:42:29,590
Now with some...

3966
01:42:29,590 --> 01:42:35,090
Okay, earlier you were saying, this stream can't be only you saying, go.

3967
01:42:35,370 --> 01:42:36,630
You have to go.

3968
01:42:36,710 --> 01:42:39,910
Now I'm talking, now you're falling and now it's my fault.

3969
01:42:41,470 --> 01:42:41,990
Yeah.

3970
01:42:43,010 --> 01:42:44,530
I'm glad we agree on something.

3971
01:42:44,650 --> 01:42:46,170
I'm glad we finally agreed on something.

3972
01:42:46,170 --> 01:42:47,390
That is your fault?

3973
01:42:47,470 --> 01:42:48,050
Yeah, yeah.

3974
01:42:48,050 --> 01:42:48,650
Keep falling.

3975
01:42:48,750 --> 01:42:49,550
That is your fault.

3976
01:42:49,630 --> 01:42:51,610
You're the only person here that didn't beat OnlyUp.

3977
01:42:51,750 --> 01:42:53,150
The only person that didn't beat OnlyUp.

3978
01:42:53,150 --> 01:42:55,270
I literally had someone just superchat me.

3979
01:42:55,390 --> 01:42:57,870
It was like, I remember when Doki beat OnlyUp.

3980
01:42:57,950 --> 01:42:59,450
Only took 30 minutes.

3981
01:43:03,210 --> 01:43:03,930
That's true.

3982
01:43:04,010 --> 01:43:04,910
That was his fault.

3983
01:43:04,950 --> 01:43:06,770
He missed the jump and made Doki fall.

3984
01:43:07,070 --> 01:43:07,850
That is so true.

3985
01:43:08,110 --> 01:43:08,830
That is so true.

3986
01:43:09,110 --> 01:43:10,010
I did not miss the jump.

3987
01:43:10,110 --> 01:43:11,130
I grabbed the ledge.

3988
01:43:15,230 --> 01:43:17,730
She made that superchat up, by the way.

3989
01:43:17,790 --> 01:43:18,910
That is not true.

3990
01:43:18,990 --> 01:43:20,870
Drez is a real person in my chat.

3991
01:43:22,230 --> 01:43:26,410
Yeah, I can also just pick one name out of my chat and pretend they gave me $100.

3992
01:43:27,230 --> 01:43:29,410
Dude, Zikir, thank you so much for the $100 bomb.

3993
01:43:29,670 --> 01:43:33,570
I've been watching Doki stream this entire time and she's lying.

3994
01:43:33,730 --> 01:43:34,670
So I know.

3995
01:43:34,810 --> 01:43:38,210
It would be more believable if you talked about like, bitties.

3996
01:43:38,550 --> 01:43:39,810
Because it's a Twitch stream.

3997
01:43:40,450 --> 01:43:40,890
BDJ.

3998
01:43:40,890 --> 01:43:42,650
Thank you for 10 gifted Ditos.

3999
01:43:42,650 --> 01:43:43,430
It's Dito's fault.

4000
01:43:43,710 --> 01:43:44,510
See, like...

4001
01:43:45,370 --> 01:43:46,990
Why are you blaming Ditto?

4002
01:43:47,330 --> 01:43:48,970
Ditto is doing the best she can.

4003
01:43:48,970 --> 01:43:49,110
It's not me.

4004
01:43:49,290 --> 01:43:49,870
It's the chatter.

4005
01:43:50,050 --> 01:43:52,250
That is so fucked up, RPR.

4006
01:43:52,250 --> 01:43:52,910
I didn't fall.

4007
01:43:53,050 --> 01:43:53,570
Yeah.

4008
01:43:53,610 --> 01:43:54,650
Ditto didn't do anything.

4009
01:43:54,730 --> 01:43:55,790
You're blaming on her.

4010
01:43:57,250 --> 01:43:58,610
Guys, it's not me.

4011
01:43:58,710 --> 01:43:59,250
It's the chatter.

4012
01:43:59,390 --> 01:44:01,190
That is so messed up.

4013
01:44:01,190 --> 01:44:02,010
I'm just reading chat.

4014
01:44:02,090 --> 01:44:03,850
That is so messed up.

4015
01:44:03,930 --> 01:44:05,770
I'm just giving like you RPR.

4016
01:44:05,790 --> 01:44:06,290
You're the baby.

4017
01:44:06,330 --> 01:44:08,090
Farno, thank you for $10.

4018
01:44:08,090 --> 01:44:08,850
Yes, I agree.

4019
01:44:08,990 --> 01:44:10,690
Doki is always fucking...

4020
01:44:10,690 --> 01:44:12,610
That's so messed up that you're blaming Ditto.

4021
01:44:12,690 --> 01:44:13,610
She did nothing wrong.

4022
01:44:13,830 --> 01:44:14,290
Yeah.

4023
01:44:14,310 --> 01:44:16,890
Ditto is actually the one heart-carrying all of us right now.

4024
01:44:17,330 --> 01:44:18,930
Your chat is toxic.

4025
01:44:19,450 --> 01:44:22,890
The Ditto that got hit by the windmill 14 times in a row...

4026
01:44:24,550 --> 01:44:25,510
14 times.

4027
01:44:26,010 --> 01:44:28,410
It's actually 15 times.

4028
01:44:31,290 --> 01:44:31,990
Look at...

4029
01:44:33,230 --> 01:44:34,670
Look, I made it.

4030
01:44:34,670 --> 01:44:35,810
I made it though.

4031
01:44:36,570 --> 01:44:38,030
It's a speedrun, Tek.

4032
01:44:40,050 --> 01:44:40,670
Ditto is...

4033
01:44:40,670 --> 01:44:42,630
Ditto is heart-carrying both of us right now, RPR.

4034
01:44:42,710 --> 01:44:43,670
Why are you blaming her?

4035
01:44:45,270 --> 01:44:47,430
She's actually heart-carrying us.

4036
01:44:47,510 --> 01:44:49,710
I even carried the swing.

4037
01:44:49,970 --> 01:44:51,150
I even carried the swing.

4038
01:44:51,250 --> 01:44:52,890
We came up with the idea.

4039
01:44:52,950 --> 01:44:54,870
You could have done the swing without us.

4040
01:44:55,150 --> 01:44:58,470
You could have done the swing without Ditto and I.

4041
01:44:58,850 --> 01:45:00,390
Yeah, you can't...

4042
01:45:00,390 --> 01:45:02,810
Yeah, we coordinated the right and the left.

4043
01:45:02,810 --> 01:45:05,910
If you came up with the idea, then how...

4044
01:45:06,970 --> 01:45:07,490
Chat.

4045
01:45:07,670 --> 01:45:08,890
What is the reason?

4046
01:45:09,090 --> 01:45:09,610
Chat.

4047
01:45:09,610 --> 01:45:10,730
Chad told us how to do it.

4048
01:45:10,930 --> 01:45:13,630
No, no, no, but what is the reason that strat worked?

4049
01:45:14,350 --> 01:45:18,090
It's because Ditto and I swung... jumped the right way.

4050
01:45:20,110 --> 01:45:22,470
That is the dumbest shit I've ever heard in my life.

4051
01:45:22,490 --> 01:45:23,170
I swear to fucking god.

4052
01:45:23,170 --> 01:45:23,750
Okay, guys.

4053
01:45:23,870 --> 01:45:24,530
Don't pull.

4054
01:45:24,670 --> 01:45:26,210
Guys, guys, guys.

4055
01:45:26,610 --> 01:45:28,370
Why did you guys pull me?

4056
01:45:28,370 --> 01:45:30,790
Why did you guys pull me?

4057
01:45:31,230 --> 01:45:33,290
Why did you guys pull me?

4058
01:45:33,450 --> 01:45:34,590
Oh my god.

4059
01:45:37,190 --> 01:45:38,630
How is this how?

4060
01:45:39,710 --> 01:45:40,670
This is...

4061
01:45:41,550 --> 01:45:43,210
It's my favorite part again.

4062
01:45:43,550 --> 01:45:44,930
Okay, Doki.

4063
01:45:45,110 --> 01:45:48,930
Doki, once and for all, I'm gonna explain the swing strat to you.

4064
01:45:48,990 --> 01:45:54,690
The reason the swing strat works is because I am the middle and I am the center of the gravity.

4065
01:45:54,810 --> 01:45:57,950
So if you two jump on each side, I will not fly off.

4066
01:45:58,070 --> 01:46:00,090
Because equal weight will be distributed on both sides.

4067
01:46:00,230 --> 01:46:00,790
Do you understand this?

4068
01:46:03,170 --> 01:46:04,130
No, got it.

4069
01:46:04,690 --> 01:46:05,790
No, I understand.

4070
01:46:06,290 --> 01:46:07,410
I'm not stupid.

4071
01:46:07,830 --> 01:46:09,250
Why are you talking to Ditto and I?

4072
01:46:09,250 --> 01:46:09,590
I said, what?

4073
01:46:09,590 --> 01:46:10,370
We're like children.

4074
01:46:10,990 --> 01:46:13,750
I'm not talking to Ditto and you.

4075
01:46:13,850 --> 01:46:14,790
Why are you treating us like kids?

4076
01:46:14,790 --> 01:46:16,250
I'm only talking to you like you're children.

4077
01:46:17,470 --> 01:46:18,350
Get it right.

4078
01:46:23,610 --> 01:46:26,350
It's called a pulley system, RnPr.

4079
01:46:26,470 --> 01:46:28,450
You don't even know the right name for it.

4080
01:46:28,630 --> 01:46:29,350
Doki, Doki.

4081
01:46:29,350 --> 01:46:31,190
It's literally the pulley system.

4082
01:46:31,790 --> 01:46:34,530
The last four drops have been your fault.

4083
01:46:34,690 --> 01:46:35,630
That's not true.

4084
01:46:36,590 --> 01:46:37,730
That is not true.

4085
01:46:37,770 --> 01:46:39,010
This is a team effort.

4086
01:46:39,010 --> 01:46:40,010
We're chained together.

4087
01:46:41,670 --> 01:46:43,910
You just didn't like IGLS better.

4088
01:46:44,030 --> 01:46:44,590
You should have done it three times in a row.

4089
01:46:46,650 --> 01:46:47,690
What are you doing?

4090
01:46:48,270 --> 01:46:49,030
What do you mean?

4091
01:46:49,130 --> 01:46:50,410
I'm like ahead of you guys.

4092
01:46:50,410 --> 01:46:51,210
What do you mean?

4093
01:46:51,850 --> 01:46:54,570
What do you mean?

4094
01:46:55,550 --> 01:46:56,150
What are you doing?

4095
01:46:56,150 --> 01:46:56,190
What do you mean?

4096
01:46:56,190 --> 01:46:58,150
I'm literally ahead of you guys.

4097
01:46:58,250 --> 01:46:59,630
Like, what are you talking about?

4098
01:47:00,090 --> 01:47:01,730
I literally made it.

4099
01:47:02,570 --> 01:47:03,610
Chill out, bro.

4100
01:47:03,810 --> 01:47:04,570
Yeah, no.

4101
01:47:04,750 --> 01:47:05,810
We are so...

4102
01:47:05,810 --> 01:47:07,530
All of us in here are so mad.

4103
01:47:09,010 --> 01:47:09,850
I'm so upset.

4104
01:47:10,970 --> 01:47:12,730
Guys, why you guys do this to me?

4105
01:47:13,490 --> 01:47:15,670
You agreed to play this game.

4106
01:47:18,510 --> 01:47:19,110
What?

4107
01:47:19,430 --> 01:47:19,870
What?

4108
01:47:20,130 --> 01:47:21,530
It still works.

4109
01:47:21,650 --> 01:47:22,270
It still works.

4110
01:47:22,830 --> 01:47:23,430
Ditto, Ditto.

4111
01:47:23,990 --> 01:47:25,050
I got pumped.

4112
01:47:25,530 --> 01:47:31,290
My dad owns YouTube and told me Doki's viewership is actually just one guy on 5000 PCs.

4113
01:47:31,810 --> 01:47:32,390
Yeah.

4114
01:47:33,110 --> 01:47:33,530
Yeah.

4115
01:47:33,610 --> 01:47:34,210
Yeah.

4116
01:47:34,490 --> 01:47:34,650
Yeah.

4117
01:47:35,750 --> 01:47:36,350
Yeah.

4118
01:47:39,010 --> 01:47:41,250
He's carrying this game right now.

4119
01:47:42,750 --> 01:47:44,810
He's giving us all the right information.

4120
01:47:46,010 --> 01:47:47,510
But his dad owns YouTube.

4121
01:47:47,730 --> 01:47:48,370
He's really exposed.

4122
01:47:49,690 --> 01:47:50,130
Yeah.

4123
01:47:50,130 --> 01:47:55,410
For months now, I have fabricated your viewership by creating thousands and thousands of accounts.

4124
01:47:55,630 --> 01:47:58,830
And now to prove this point, I will copy paste this message with all of my accounts.

4125
01:47:59,250 --> 01:47:59,690
Okay.

4126
01:47:59,750 --> 01:48:03,190
If he really wants to do that successfully, it has to be a short-term.

4127
01:48:03,570 --> 01:48:04,010
Don't fall.

4128
01:48:04,010 --> 01:48:04,230
Don't fall.

4129
01:48:04,830 --> 01:48:05,890
Don't fall, RPR.

4130
01:48:06,730 --> 01:48:07,610
Don't fall.

4131
01:48:07,810 --> 01:48:08,630
RPR, don't fall.

4132
01:48:09,690 --> 01:48:10,130
Don't fall.

4133
01:48:10,490 --> 01:48:11,750
Don't fall, RPR.

4134
01:48:11,830 --> 01:48:12,490
We saw that.

4135
01:48:12,650 --> 01:48:13,510
We saw that.

4136
01:48:13,850 --> 01:48:15,850
Yeah, but you see, when I fall, I save it.

4137
01:48:15,870 --> 01:48:16,570
You just fall.

4138
01:48:16,830 --> 01:48:18,890
No, I saved it, but then you pushed me.

4139
01:48:20,470 --> 01:48:20,910
Okay.

4140
01:48:21,010 --> 01:48:21,450
Okay.

4141
01:48:21,970 --> 01:48:23,070
You saved yourself.

4142
01:48:23,070 --> 01:48:24,490
You can push this game.

4143
01:48:24,670 --> 01:48:25,170
Yes, you can.

4144
01:48:25,490 --> 01:48:28,690
At a certain point of the map, we didn't have the push mechanic.

4145
01:48:30,650 --> 01:48:32,270
I know the devs and you don't.

4146
01:48:32,270 --> 01:48:33,010
And I know this for life.

4147
01:48:33,010 --> 01:48:33,730
I knew the devs.

4148
01:48:33,770 --> 01:48:36,750
You called the devs a bitch.

4149
01:48:36,790 --> 01:48:38,550
So, like, you don't have the...

4150
01:48:38,550 --> 01:48:38,990
No, I don't.

4151
01:48:39,010 --> 01:48:40,190
I don't have the permission anymore.

4152
01:48:40,430 --> 01:48:44,990
But you wouldn't know that because you're not tight like that with devs like I am.

4153
01:48:45,130 --> 01:48:45,670
Oh, yeah?

4154
01:48:45,730 --> 01:48:46,450
What's their name?

4155
01:48:47,950 --> 01:48:51,230
I don't know their nickname because we're tight like that with homies.

4156
01:48:51,430 --> 01:48:51,970
Oh, yeah.

4157
01:48:52,010 --> 01:48:54,090
You don't know their names because you're tight like that.

4158
01:48:55,290 --> 01:48:56,730
Then they're not homies.

4159
01:48:56,750 --> 01:48:57,490
Then they're not homies.

4160
01:48:57,490 --> 01:48:57,570
Then they're not homies.

4161
01:48:57,570 --> 01:48:58,170
Then what's their nickname?

4162
01:48:58,570 --> 01:48:59,710
Their nickname is bitch?

4163
01:48:59,810 --> 01:49:00,170
Listen, Doki.

4164
01:49:00,170 --> 01:49:07,830
There's guys I know on the internet whose IRL name I do not know and I've known them for 17 years.

4165
01:49:07,830 --> 01:49:08,670
Okay?

4166
01:49:09,210 --> 01:49:11,230
Then you're not this homie's homie.

4167
01:49:11,630 --> 01:49:14,790
You think they're your homie, but you're not their homie.

4168
01:49:16,410 --> 01:49:19,430
I've met this person like seven times IRL.

4169
01:49:20,570 --> 01:49:22,090
Yeah, but you're not close enough.

4170
01:49:22,250 --> 01:49:24,370
You're like an acquaintance then.

4171
01:49:24,690 --> 01:49:27,550
Okay, but give me one good reason why I would need to know their name.

4172
01:49:27,990 --> 01:49:30,830
Because you're like, hey, I need you...

4173
01:49:31,590 --> 01:49:32,070
What?

4174
01:49:35,030 --> 01:49:37,110
You're like, hey, I need you.

4175
01:49:37,110 --> 01:49:37,810
I need you.

4176
01:49:37,810 --> 01:49:40,990
Can I see how you do your tax forms, homie?

4177
01:49:41,630 --> 01:49:43,150
I need help with taxes.

4178
01:49:43,250 --> 01:49:45,330
Can I see an example of how you do your taxes?

4179
01:49:45,850 --> 01:49:47,290
Doki, let me explain something.

4180
01:49:47,450 --> 01:49:48,330
In Europe, right?

4181
01:49:48,450 --> 01:49:48,730
Yeah.

4182
01:49:48,910 --> 01:49:53,030
There's about a 400 million countries and all tax firms are different.

4183
01:49:53,170 --> 01:49:59,130
Even if I knew his name, what the fuck can he do to me to help me with my taxes when he lives in a different country?

4184
01:49:59,870 --> 01:50:01,290
He can help you with calculations.

4185
01:50:01,590 --> 01:50:02,410
What do you mean?

4186
01:50:04,030 --> 01:50:04,870
I can count.

4187
01:50:04,930 --> 01:50:06,030
I went to a math school.

4188
01:50:06,630 --> 01:50:07,790
You went to a math school?

4189
01:50:07,790 --> 01:50:08,650
Masqal?

4190
01:50:09,290 --> 01:50:10,770
Math and science.

4191
01:50:10,990 --> 01:50:12,010
Why do you like this then?

4192
01:50:14,590 --> 01:50:16,190
Why do you like this?

4193
01:50:23,970 --> 01:50:29,510
I'm li- 3, 2, 1, go.

4194
01:50:29,690 --> 01:50:35,830
I literally fixed our- our- our swinging issue using physics.

4195
01:50:35,830 --> 01:50:37,750
And you call me dumb.

4196
01:50:40,250 --> 01:50:42,450
Can I remind you what your idea was again?

4197
01:50:43,830 --> 01:50:44,670
A swing.

4198
01:50:45,090 --> 01:50:48,110
It was- you- you built off my initial hypothesis.

4199
01:50:48,630 --> 01:50:52,050
Yeah, your idea is I jump guys and then it's gonna happen.

4200
01:50:53,450 --> 01:50:53,930
Okay.

4201
01:50:55,590 --> 01:50:57,350
Fuck man, I think I got copypasted.

4202
01:50:57,350 --> 01:50:57,550
I go left.

4203
01:50:57,550 --> 01:50:57,710
I go right.

4204
01:50:57,890 --> 01:50:58,230
You ready?

4205
01:50:58,590 --> 01:51:01,110
3, 2, 1, go.

4206
01:51:03,850 --> 01:51:05,210
Alright, just go forward.

4207
01:51:05,270 --> 01:51:05,810
Go forward.

4208
01:51:05,830 --> 01:51:06,630
Okay, Okay.

4209
01:51:06,790 --> 01:51:07,350
Dang.

4210
01:51:07,470 --> 01:51:08,070
Nice, nice.

4211
01:51:08,070 --> 01:51:08,530
We did it Ditto.

4212
01:51:08,630 --> 01:51:09,010
Yes.

4213
01:51:09,310 --> 01:51:09,610
Nice.

4214
01:51:09,810 --> 01:51:10,430
1 second.

4215
01:51:10,690 --> 01:51:11,650
1 second.

4216
01:51:11,990 --> 01:51:12,610
Okay 1...

4217
01:51:14,090 --> 01:51:14,650
2...

4218
01:51:14,650 --> 01:51:15,270
If it's one, 1.

4219
01:51:15,270 --> 01:51:17,550
Oh my god the math student knows how to count to 2.

4220
01:51:17,850 --> 01:51:18,410
1...

4221
01:51:18,410 --> 01:51:18,850
2.

4222
01:51:21,690 --> 01:51:22,250
2...

4223
01:51:22,830 --> 01:51:23,110
Wow.

4224
01:51:23,470 --> 01:51:25,590
We did it guys lolol.

4225
01:51:26,210 --> 01:51:26,770
Nice.

4226
01:51:26,790 --> 01:51:29,810
Oh my god everyone is spamming the copypaster now.

4227
01:51:30,910 --> 01:51:33,330
I've got the room that can't even read it anymore.

4228
01:51:33,590 --> 01:51:33,970
Ahahaha.

4229
01:51:34,390 --> 01:51:35,450
Easier to read?

4230
01:51:35,830 --> 01:51:38,950
You come to mine or Ditto's chat to have a good chatting experience.

4231
01:51:41,150 --> 01:51:43,990
You sent in your spies to destroy my chat.

4232
01:51:45,550 --> 01:51:46,030
Ready?

4233
01:51:46,130 --> 01:51:46,490
Go.

4234
01:51:47,450 --> 01:51:48,510
We did it, guys.

4235
01:51:49,370 --> 01:51:50,750
Where did we die?

4236
01:51:51,830 --> 01:51:52,490
I don't know.

4237
01:51:52,550 --> 01:51:52,630
Go.

4238
01:51:53,450 --> 01:51:54,730
I think it was here, wasn't it?

4239
01:51:54,830 --> 01:51:55,490
Yeah, it's right here.

4240
01:51:55,510 --> 01:51:56,130
You see the lasers?

4241
01:51:56,510 --> 01:51:58,030
3, 2, 1, go.

4242
01:51:58,730 --> 01:52:00,210
I see the lasers, guys.

4243
01:52:00,630 --> 01:52:00,890
Okay.

4244
01:52:01,270 --> 01:52:03,810
Slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly.

4245
01:52:03,810 --> 01:52:04,130
Slowly.

4246
01:52:05,010 --> 01:52:05,870
Right here.

4247
01:52:06,210 --> 01:52:07,770
Wait, did we die at the lasers?

4248
01:52:07,950 --> 01:52:09,170
Yeah, we died at the lasers.

4249
01:52:09,970 --> 01:52:10,210
Yeah.

4250
01:52:11,610 --> 01:52:13,650
3, 2, 1, go.

4251
01:52:15,070 --> 01:52:15,810
Guys, I'm scared.

4252
01:52:16,230 --> 01:52:17,770
Let's come up with a strategy.

4253
01:52:17,910 --> 01:52:19,490
3, 2, 1, go.

4254
01:52:21,610 --> 01:52:22,450
Okay, strategy.

4255
01:52:23,850 --> 01:52:26,110
We go... We run until... You stupid.

4256
01:52:27,830 --> 01:52:30,610
We run until the middle and then we jump.

4257
01:52:32,030 --> 01:52:32,790
You know what?

4258
01:52:32,790 --> 01:52:33,490
Let's just wing it.

4259
01:52:33,490 --> 01:52:34,330
Let's just wing it.

4260
01:52:34,410 --> 01:52:34,850
Fuck it.

4261
01:52:34,990 --> 01:52:37,450
3, 2, 1, go.

4262
01:52:39,290 --> 01:52:39,770
Jump.

4263
01:52:40,250 --> 01:52:40,730
Go.

4264
01:52:41,730 --> 01:52:42,210
Jump.

4265
01:52:42,550 --> 01:52:43,430
We did it.

4266
01:52:43,750 --> 01:52:44,190
Jump.

4267
01:52:44,190 --> 01:52:45,450
Holy shit, I'm so smart.

4268
01:52:45,830 --> 01:52:47,770
You said you are not smart.

4269
01:52:47,870 --> 01:52:48,710
You literally said...

4270
01:52:49,510 --> 01:52:50,510
Guys, guys, guys.

4271
01:52:50,690 --> 01:52:52,510
Why didn't you say jump?

4272
01:52:53,550 --> 01:52:55,250
Because we don't need that anymore.

4273
01:52:55,330 --> 01:52:56,390
3, 2, 1, go.

4274
01:52:58,250 --> 01:52:59,150
But you fall.

4275
01:53:00,150 --> 01:53:01,970
They don't literally clutch it for us.

4276
01:53:01,970 --> 01:53:03,650
They don't literally clutch that.

4277
01:53:04,590 --> 01:53:08,150
Guys, I just did everything and I still got zero credit.

4278
01:53:08,230 --> 01:53:09,710
Ditto clutched that for us.

4279
01:53:09,870 --> 01:53:11,810
Your plan was like, let's wing it.

4280
01:53:11,850 --> 01:53:12,650
That is your plan.

4281
01:53:12,890 --> 01:53:16,970
Some fucking math and science dude that said just wing it.

4282
01:53:17,750 --> 01:53:20,010
I just did everything and I got zero credit.

4283
01:53:20,470 --> 01:53:21,510
Yeah, just like...

4284
01:53:21,510 --> 01:53:21,750
What?

4285
01:53:21,990 --> 01:53:23,250
You did everything.

4286
01:53:23,690 --> 01:53:24,610
What do you mean you did everything?

4287
01:53:24,750 --> 01:53:25,870
Ditto clutched it.

4288
01:53:26,110 --> 01:53:28,770
We made it to the subway because of Ditto.

4289
01:53:28,890 --> 01:53:31,530
At least credit Ditto for her hard work.

4290
01:53:32,930 --> 01:53:35,430
You can't say wing it and claim credit for everything.

4291
01:53:35,530 --> 01:53:38,210
But I was the one that said how we're gonna wing it.

4292
01:53:38,350 --> 01:53:39,330
Ready to jump here?

4293
01:53:39,470 --> 01:53:39,910
Yeah.

4294
01:53:40,610 --> 01:53:42,910
3, 2, 1, go.

4295
01:53:44,250 --> 01:53:45,410
We did it.

4296
01:53:45,570 --> 01:53:47,170
We come, we come, Shay.

4297
01:53:47,470 --> 01:53:49,510
Yeah, just slow and steady guys.

4298
01:53:50,190 --> 01:53:51,310
Slow and steady.

4299
01:53:51,710 --> 01:53:52,570
This is just jumps.

4300
01:53:52,570 --> 01:53:53,530
Oh yeah, we're not gonna die here.

4301
01:53:56,330 --> 01:53:56,810
Go.

4302
01:53:58,250 --> 01:53:58,730
Go.

4303
01:53:59,210 --> 01:53:59,690
Go.

4304
01:54:02,650 --> 01:54:03,610
Guys, guys.

4305
01:54:03,810 --> 01:54:04,570
Guys, guys.

4306
01:54:05,510 --> 01:54:06,630
Ditto, Ditto, Ditto.

4307
01:54:06,630 --> 01:54:08,390
Ditto, what are you doing, Ditto?

4308
01:54:09,490 --> 01:54:13,030
Okay, 3, 2, 1, go.

4309
01:54:15,490 --> 01:54:16,430
Guys, Ditto.

4310
01:54:16,590 --> 01:54:17,510
Hey, Ditto.

4311
01:54:19,610 --> 01:54:21,150
Ditto, Ditto, Ditto.

4312
01:54:21,150 --> 01:54:21,930
Please, Ditto, Ditto.

4313
01:54:21,930 --> 01:54:23,970
Please, Ditto, Ditto.

4314
01:54:23,970 --> 01:54:25,550
Please, Ditto, Ditto.

4315
01:54:25,550 --> 01:54:26,430
Ditto, Ditto, Ditto.

4316
01:54:26,610 --> 01:54:27,490
Ditto, Ditto, Ditto.

4317
01:54:27,490 --> 01:54:28,430
Please, Ditto, Ditto.

4318
01:54:28,430 --> 01:54:29,130
Please, Ditto, Ditto.

4319
01:54:29,610 --> 01:54:29,810
Please, Ditto, Ditto.

4320
01:54:38,030 --> 01:54:42,670
Okay, I will admit that was the first mistake I've made today.

4321
01:54:47,830 --> 01:54:51,010
That was the first mistake I've ever made today.

4322
01:54:51,450 --> 01:54:56,170
I am willing to take the blame for the first mistake.

4323
01:54:56,170 --> 01:54:57,810
She said that was the first.

4324
01:55:00,450 --> 01:55:01,330
It's down there.

4325
01:55:01,510 --> 01:55:02,890
I see it.

4326
01:55:03,030 --> 01:55:04,950
Guys, I'm gonna be real with you guys.

4327
01:55:06,050 --> 01:55:07,450
We're not doing all that again.

4328
01:55:08,230 --> 01:55:10,090
I'm not doing all that again.

4329
01:55:10,190 --> 01:55:11,110
It's all the way down there.

4330
01:55:12,070 --> 01:55:12,790
Okay, this way.

4331
01:55:13,730 --> 01:55:14,570
I see the right.

4332
01:55:14,870 --> 01:55:15,630
Yeah, you see it?

4333
01:55:16,210 --> 01:55:17,470
Yeah, I see it.

4334
01:55:17,810 --> 01:55:18,490
It's right here.

4335
01:55:19,470 --> 01:55:19,870
Jump!

4336
01:55:21,530 --> 01:55:21,930
Ready?

4337
01:55:24,730 --> 01:55:25,130
Yeah.

4338
01:55:26,350 --> 01:55:27,090
To the right.

4339
01:55:27,090 --> 01:55:27,450
To the right.

4340
01:55:27,450 --> 01:55:28,170
To the front of us.

4341
01:55:28,190 --> 01:55:30,470
Three, two, one, go.

4342
01:55:33,570 --> 01:55:35,610
Here, okay.

4343
01:55:35,730 --> 01:55:36,410
And jump again.

4344
01:55:37,030 --> 01:55:38,030
Jump to the cross.

4345
01:55:38,130 --> 01:55:39,070
Jump to the cross here.

4346
01:55:39,310 --> 01:55:40,130
To the cross, dude.

4347
01:55:40,370 --> 01:55:42,570
Three, two, one, go.

4348
01:55:44,050 --> 01:55:44,970
There we go.

4349
01:55:45,170 --> 01:55:45,410
See?

4350
01:55:45,810 --> 01:55:47,070
We're doing it, guys.

4351
01:55:48,410 --> 01:55:48,850
Okay.

4352
01:55:48,850 --> 01:55:48,930
Okay.

4353
01:55:50,630 --> 01:55:54,970
See, at least I am an adult and I can admit when I fuck up.

4354
01:55:56,510 --> 01:56:04,350
Okay, every single time you've fallen, you've said, somehow we pushed you or pulled you or made you distracted.

4355
01:56:06,350 --> 01:56:06,950
I know.

4356
01:56:07,270 --> 01:56:11,730
So every time you've fallen, it was our fault, even though you fell.

4357
01:56:11,830 --> 01:56:12,530
No, no, no.

4358
01:56:12,630 --> 01:56:15,130
It wasn't everybody's fault.

4359
01:56:15,170 --> 01:56:15,990
It was your fault.

4360
01:56:16,630 --> 01:56:17,430
Uh-huh.

4361
01:56:18,450 --> 01:56:19,910
Ditto was innocent.

4362
01:56:20,270 --> 01:56:23,070
I don't know why you keep dragging Ditto into this argument.

4363
01:56:23,310 --> 01:56:23,910
Yeah, I know.

4364
01:56:23,910 --> 01:56:25,590
She has not done anything wrong.

4365
01:56:25,790 --> 01:56:26,230
Yeah.

4366
01:56:26,610 --> 01:56:27,050
Yep.

4367
01:56:27,130 --> 01:56:28,750
That makes everything so much better.

4368
01:56:35,600 --> 01:56:36,040
Yeah.

4369
01:56:36,580 --> 01:56:37,700
We're doing it, guys.

4370
01:56:38,060 --> 01:56:38,500
Teamwork.

4371
01:56:38,660 --> 01:56:39,600
Yeah, we're doing it.

4372
01:56:39,860 --> 01:56:40,280
Teamwork.

4373
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:42,120
I remember these.

4374
01:56:42,660 --> 01:56:43,280
Teamwork, guys.

4375
01:56:44,180 --> 01:56:45,740
Next fall, I'm going to bed.

4376
01:56:45,800 --> 01:56:46,400
I'm not even kidding.

4377
01:56:46,460 --> 01:56:46,960
It's 4 a.m.

4378
01:56:47,820 --> 01:56:48,700
Guys, please.

4379
01:56:48,820 --> 01:56:50,180
Guys, guys, guys.

4380
01:56:51,340 --> 01:56:51,780
Teamwork.

4381
01:56:52,900 --> 01:56:53,680
Teamwork, guys.

4382
01:56:55,840 --> 01:56:56,320
All right.

4383
01:56:56,360 --> 01:56:56,980
I'm going to hug the wall.

4384
01:56:57,420 --> 01:56:58,140
Teamwork, guys.

4385
01:56:58,300 --> 01:57:00,580
Next fall is bed, okay?

4386
01:57:00,620 --> 01:57:01,440
Next fall is bed.

4387
01:57:01,480 --> 01:57:02,080
It's 4 a.m.

4388
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:02,400
Okay.

4389
01:57:03,140 --> 01:57:03,500
Okay.

4390
01:57:03,500 --> 01:57:04,000
But what if you're the one...

4391
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:04,740
It's 9 a.m.

4392
01:57:04,740 --> 01:57:05,200
All right.

4393
01:57:05,240 --> 01:57:08,640
Whoever falls is the reason why we're losing.

4394
01:57:09,080 --> 01:57:09,440
No.

4395
01:57:09,620 --> 01:57:09,980
No.

4396
01:57:10,120 --> 01:57:10,320
Yep.

4397
01:57:10,440 --> 01:57:10,800
All right.

4398
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:12,140
Whoever falls is the reason.

4399
01:57:12,420 --> 01:57:13,760
Three, two, one, go.

4400
01:57:16,220 --> 01:57:16,760
All right.

4401
01:57:18,100 --> 01:57:19,340
Are we going to beat this game?

4402
01:57:20,180 --> 01:57:21,280
You're in the most dangerous.

4403
01:57:21,460 --> 01:57:21,860
You know that?

4404
01:57:23,580 --> 01:57:25,960
Are we ever going to beat this game, guys?

4405
01:57:27,340 --> 01:57:27,780
No.

4406
01:57:27,780 --> 01:57:29,240
I'm going to install it after this.

4407
01:57:32,280 --> 01:57:34,280
Guys, we're going to hit 600, guys.

4408
01:57:35,160 --> 01:57:36,820
Do you think we can hit 1,000?

4409
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:37,400
Okay.

4410
01:57:37,660 --> 01:57:39,400
I want to see the city.

4411
01:57:39,580 --> 01:57:39,900
Okay.

4412
01:57:39,940 --> 01:57:40,420
Ready, Ditto?

4413
01:57:40,760 --> 01:57:43,080
Three, two, one, go.

4414
01:57:46,580 --> 01:57:48,020
I invented this shot, though.

4415
01:57:48,900 --> 01:57:49,460
Oh, yeah.

4416
01:57:49,500 --> 01:57:51,300
You invented the pulley system.

4417
01:57:52,420 --> 01:57:52,980
Yep.

4418
01:57:53,080 --> 01:57:54,020
I invented that.

4419
01:57:54,100 --> 01:57:55,300
Well, one.

4420
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:56,460
One.

4421
01:57:56,820 --> 01:57:57,380
One.

4422
01:57:57,760 --> 01:57:58,320
Two.

4423
01:57:58,980 --> 01:57:59,540
Okay.

4424
01:58:00,020 --> 01:58:00,800
There you go.

4425
01:58:01,260 --> 01:58:01,540
One.

4426
01:58:03,940 --> 01:58:04,500
Two.

4427
01:58:05,500 --> 01:58:06,060
Okay.

4428
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:08,000
We did it.

4429
01:58:08,060 --> 01:58:08,460
Okay.

4430
01:58:08,820 --> 01:58:09,380
Okay.

4431
01:58:09,700 --> 01:58:11,120
We're doing it, guys.

4432
01:58:12,420 --> 01:58:12,980
Okay.

4433
01:58:13,640 --> 01:58:16,720
I'm a little worried that we're not calling the jumps for this.

4434
01:58:17,920 --> 01:58:18,480
Why?

4435
01:58:18,660 --> 01:58:19,140
It's small.

4436
01:58:19,140 --> 01:58:19,560
It's small.

4437
01:58:19,560 --> 01:58:19,740
It's small.

4438
01:58:19,740 --> 01:58:19,880
It's small.

4439
01:58:20,720 --> 01:58:21,280
It's small.

4440
01:58:21,300 --> 01:58:23,280
Every jump matters now.

4441
01:58:24,900 --> 01:58:25,560
All right.

4442
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:27,220
What the fuck?

4443
01:58:27,380 --> 01:58:28,880
How did I get pulled up there?

4444
01:58:29,720 --> 01:58:31,180
These are easy jumps.

4445
01:58:31,260 --> 01:58:31,900
Easy jumps.

4446
01:58:34,580 --> 01:58:35,180
Okay.

4447
01:58:35,180 --> 01:58:36,060
Easy jumps.

4448
01:58:36,280 --> 01:58:38,280
Three, two, one, go.

4449
01:58:39,380 --> 01:58:40,400
Easy jump.

4450
01:58:41,660 --> 01:58:43,720
Walking, walking, running, running, running.

4451
01:58:44,080 --> 01:58:44,800
All right.

4452
01:58:44,880 --> 01:58:45,780
Easy jump.

4453
01:58:46,140 --> 01:58:46,140
Easy jumps.

4454
01:58:46,140 --> 01:58:46,680
Easy jump.

4455
01:58:47,260 --> 01:58:47,860
RPR.

4456
01:58:47,860 --> 01:58:48,540
I thought it was easy.

4457
01:58:49,300 --> 01:58:49,900
RPR?

4458
01:58:49,900 --> 01:58:50,460
RPR?

4459
01:58:50,600 --> 01:58:51,500
I thought this was easy.

4460
01:58:51,660 --> 01:58:52,160
You guys pulled me.

4461
01:58:52,500 --> 01:58:53,940
How did we pull you?

4462
01:58:54,260 --> 01:58:55,560
Three, two, one, go.

4463
01:58:55,700 --> 01:58:56,460
No complaining.

4464
01:58:56,540 --> 01:58:57,180
Just jumping.

4465
01:58:57,420 --> 01:58:57,840
Okay.

4466
01:58:58,140 --> 01:59:00,380
Three, two, one, go.

4467
01:59:02,420 --> 01:59:02,920
Okay.

4468
01:59:03,220 --> 01:59:03,520
Okay.

4469
01:59:04,160 --> 01:59:05,160
We wing it.

4470
01:59:05,280 --> 01:59:05,960
We wing it.

4471
01:59:08,840 --> 01:59:09,340
Now.

4472
01:59:10,760 --> 01:59:11,260
Jump.

4473
01:59:12,140 --> 01:59:12,640
Now.

4474
01:59:13,440 --> 01:59:13,940
Jump.

4475
01:59:14,740 --> 01:59:15,240
Now.

4476
01:59:15,360 --> 01:59:15,760
All right.

4477
01:59:16,740 --> 01:59:17,240
Three.

4478
01:59:17,740 --> 01:59:18,240
No.

4479
01:59:18,680 --> 01:59:19,180
No.

4480
01:59:19,180 --> 01:59:19,500
No.

4481
01:59:19,500 --> 01:59:19,720
No.

4482
01:59:19,720 --> 01:59:19,880
No.

4483
01:59:24,360 --> 01:59:26,400
You watch my legs go up.

4484
01:59:35,060 --> 01:59:37,780
Three, two, one, go.

4485
01:59:38,640 --> 01:59:39,360
Okay.

4486
01:59:41,700 --> 01:59:44,620
Three, two, one, go.

4487
01:59:46,100 --> 01:59:49,800
Three, two, one, go.

4488
01:59:50,720 --> 01:59:51,920
Okay, okay.

4489
01:59:51,980 --> 01:59:52,020
Yes.

4490
01:59:52,020 --> 01:59:52,900
Okay, we got it.

4491
01:59:53,100 --> 01:59:53,580
Okay.

4492
01:59:54,760 --> 01:59:56,460
2, 1, go.

4493
01:59:57,300 --> 01:59:57,780
Yay!

4494
01:59:59,220 --> 02:00:00,160
Okay, okay, okay.

4495
02:00:02,320 --> 02:00:03,660
Okay, this is where we fall.

4496
02:00:03,880 --> 02:00:04,680
This is where we fell.

4497
02:00:05,360 --> 02:00:07,360
Okay, slowly, slowly, slowly.

4498
02:00:07,880 --> 02:00:08,960
Jump over laser.

4499
02:00:10,140 --> 02:00:13,140
Okay, now we count here, okay?

4500
02:00:13,540 --> 02:00:14,280
Okay, now we count here, okay?

4501
02:00:14,280 --> 02:00:16,220
3, 2, 1, go.

4502
02:00:16,860 --> 02:00:17,160
3, 2, 1, go.

4503
02:00:18,120 --> 02:00:19,260
Okay, we're dead.

4504
02:00:19,360 --> 02:00:19,860
I'm dead.

4505
02:00:19,860 --> 02:00:20,940
No, no, no.

4506
02:00:20,980 --> 02:00:21,680
Pull me faster.

4507
02:00:21,780 --> 02:00:22,940
Pull me, pull me, pull me.

4508
02:00:23,660 --> 02:00:25,980
I'm pulling, I'm pulling, I'm pulling.

4509
02:00:26,680 --> 02:00:27,560
She's not pulling.

4510
02:00:27,560 --> 02:00:28,720
You both have to pull.

4511
02:00:28,900 --> 02:00:31,420
You both have to pull.

4512
02:00:32,500 --> 02:00:33,120
Don't fall, Dito.

4513
02:00:33,200 --> 02:00:33,700
Do not fall.

4514
02:00:33,740 --> 02:00:34,540
Dito, do not fall.

4515
02:00:34,540 --> 02:00:36,720
I'm pressing.

4516
02:00:37,360 --> 02:00:37,900
I'm pressing.

4517
02:00:38,660 --> 02:00:39,580
I got you.

4518
02:00:39,640 --> 02:00:40,640
I got you, I got you, I got you.

4519
02:00:41,440 --> 02:00:42,500
Okay, okay.

4520
02:00:45,360 --> 02:00:45,720
Okay.

4521
02:00:47,840 --> 02:00:48,700
Okay, we win.

4522
02:00:50,860 --> 02:00:52,540
How the fuck are we going to do this?

4523
02:00:55,540 --> 02:00:57,180
I saved you guys.

4524
02:00:57,220 --> 02:00:58,580
Remember what I did?

4525
02:00:59,940 --> 02:01:01,020
How are we going to win?

4526
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:03,760
No, you always said wing it.

4527
02:01:04,740 --> 02:01:05,420
Fuck it.

4528
02:01:05,460 --> 02:01:06,700
Just follow me, okay?

4529
02:01:08,160 --> 02:01:09,160
We go...

4530
02:01:09,710 --> 02:01:10,580
We go... now.

4531
02:01:10,860 --> 02:01:11,420
Now go.

4532
02:01:12,340 --> 02:01:12,840
Jump.

4533
02:01:13,540 --> 02:01:14,200
Jump again.

4534
02:01:16,180 --> 02:01:17,280
Just out the porch.

4535
02:01:18,440 --> 02:01:19,200
I'm dead.

4536
02:01:21,420 --> 02:01:22,660
We didn't follow you down.

4537
02:01:22,680 --> 02:01:23,800
We can do this again.

4538
02:01:24,740 --> 02:01:25,520
No, I'm not.

4539
02:01:25,740 --> 02:01:26,160
I'm fucking done.

4540
02:01:26,260 --> 02:01:26,920
No, no more.

4541
02:01:26,980 --> 02:01:27,380
No more.

4542
02:01:28,180 --> 02:01:29,260
That wasn't me.

4543
02:01:29,320 --> 02:01:30,900
I know for sure that wasn't me.

4544
02:01:30,920 --> 02:01:31,620
Who was it?

4545
02:01:31,740 --> 02:01:32,960
Who the fuck was it?

4546
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:33,780
Who touched it?

4547
02:01:33,940 --> 02:01:34,840
Who touched it?

4548
02:01:35,220 --> 02:01:36,980
RPR, did you touch it?

4549
02:01:37,880 --> 02:01:40,340
That one was hard as fuck.

4550
02:01:40,500 --> 02:01:41,680
How did you beat that one?

4551
02:01:41,860 --> 02:01:43,180
How did you beat that one?

4552
02:01:43,220 --> 02:01:44,300
That one was hard as fuck.

4553
02:01:44,380 --> 02:01:45,900
How do you not touch the laser?

4554
02:01:47,260 --> 02:01:48,640
By the way, it was all of us.

4555
02:01:48,660 --> 02:01:49,380
All of us got it.

4556
02:01:50,160 --> 02:01:52,560
I was on the other side.

4557
02:01:52,940 --> 02:01:54,460
I was on the other side.

4558
02:01:54,740 --> 02:01:55,660
Oh my god.

4559
02:01:57,620 --> 02:01:58,900
Not my fault.

4560
02:01:58,980 --> 02:02:00,640
I made...

4561
02:02:01,380 --> 02:02:02,840
I admit my mistakes.

4562
02:02:03,140 --> 02:02:04,620
You didn't admit your mistakes.

4563
02:02:04,940 --> 02:02:06,660
Ditto and I both admit it when we fucked up.

4564
02:02:06,660 --> 02:02:07,980
I said it was all of our fault there.

4565
02:02:08,160 --> 02:02:09,000
I screwed it.

4566
02:02:11,140 --> 02:02:14,060
I'm sorry that I'm a perfect human being and I just don't make mistakes.

4567
02:02:14,360 --> 02:02:14,860
I'm sorry.

4568
02:02:15,900 --> 02:02:16,380
She did.

4569
02:02:17,600 --> 02:02:20,240
We all made goodbyes.

4570
02:02:20,240 --> 02:02:21,140
I don't make mistakes.

4571
02:02:21,280 --> 02:02:21,840
My bad.

4572
02:02:22,720 --> 02:02:25,660
Let's look at everything that we did today guys.

4573
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:28,040
Look at the beautiful scenery.

4574
02:02:29,340 --> 02:02:31,800
Look at the beautiful...

4575
02:02:31,800 --> 02:02:32,880
This is everything we did.

4576
02:02:32,880 --> 02:02:34,200
We actually went up quite a lot.

4577
02:02:35,940 --> 02:02:37,520
It's so beautiful.

4578
02:02:40,420 --> 02:02:41,520
Jump off the map.

4579
02:02:41,880 --> 02:02:43,320
It's so beautiful.

4580
02:02:43,360 --> 02:02:43,920
Can we?

4581
02:02:44,160 --> 02:02:44,980
No, we can't.

4582
02:02:46,020 --> 02:02:46,940
What the fuck?

4583
02:02:47,100 --> 02:02:49,180
This way.

4584
02:02:49,220 --> 02:02:50,700
It's so beautiful.

4585
02:02:54,060 --> 02:02:55,380
That's us right there.

4586
02:02:55,400 --> 02:02:58,920
I wish that was me right now.

4587
02:02:59,200 --> 02:03:01,200
I wish that was me.

4588
02:03:01,220 --> 02:03:03,240
Those people are too big.

4589
02:03:03,360 --> 02:03:04,380
Oh my god.

4590
02:03:04,460 --> 02:03:04,940
You're right.

4591
02:03:05,040 --> 02:03:07,220
How big are these people?

4592
02:03:08,080 --> 02:03:08,860
I'm glad.

4593
02:03:10,540 --> 02:03:12,180
Are we gonna beat this?

4594
02:03:12,180 --> 02:03:13,580
Are we ever gonna beat this guys?

4595
02:03:14,100 --> 02:03:15,720
Are we gonna beat this game?

4596
02:03:15,900 --> 02:03:16,380
Guys...

4597
02:03:17,420 --> 02:03:19,080
Yo, you wanna go for round two?

4598
02:03:19,400 --> 02:03:21,020
Are we gonna beat it?

4599
02:03:23,040 --> 02:03:24,800
You wanna go for round two on this?

4600
02:03:24,980 --> 02:03:26,080
Yeah, I'm down.

4601
02:03:26,940 --> 02:03:28,800
Just the fucking way you're down.

4602
02:03:30,540 --> 02:03:31,420
You're a quitter.

4603
02:03:31,500 --> 02:03:32,200
You're a coward.

4604
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:34,140
They don't know I can... are down for it.

4605
02:03:34,920 --> 02:03:35,800
You're a coward.

4606
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:36,580
You're a quitter.

4607
02:03:37,620 --> 02:03:38,380
Let's do it then.

4608
02:03:38,540 --> 02:03:39,660
Yeah, let's do it.

4609
02:03:39,760 --> 02:03:40,560
Let's beat this game.

4610
02:03:41,580 --> 02:03:42,300
Not now.

4611
02:03:42,360 --> 02:03:42,920
Next time.

4612
02:03:42,920 --> 02:03:45,220
I'm not gonna stream it guys.

4613
02:03:45,300 --> 02:03:45,680
I'm not gonna.

4614
02:03:47,620 --> 02:03:49,160
What do you mean you're not gonna stream it?

4615
02:03:49,940 --> 02:03:51,880
When do we beat this off stream?

4616
02:03:52,340 --> 02:03:53,260
When do we beat this off stream?

4617
02:03:53,260 --> 02:03:54,900
Yeah, we'll beat it off stream.

4618
02:03:55,660 --> 02:03:57,540
I'll just give the controller to my brother.

4619
02:03:57,680 --> 02:03:58,060
Yeah, yeah.

4620
02:03:59,280 --> 02:04:00,080
Same vibe.

4621
02:04:00,220 --> 02:04:05,660
Let me DM the speedrunner for the speedrunner team.

4622
02:04:05,740 --> 02:04:06,020
Let me DM the speedrunner for the speedrunner team.

4623
02:04:06,020 --> 02:04:06,560
Oh my god.

4624
02:04:06,620 --> 02:04:08,300
Okay, so you know how this game is on Steam?

4625
02:04:08,600 --> 02:04:11,600
So like we hire a speedrunning team.

4626
02:04:11,600 --> 02:04:15,500
And then we ask them to change their names to our name.

4627
02:04:15,640 --> 02:04:16,760
And then like record it.

4628
02:04:16,800 --> 02:04:17,900
And then we voice act it.

4629
02:04:21,100 --> 02:04:23,980
That's more effort than actually beating the game.

4630
02:04:24,180 --> 02:04:25,240
No it's not.

4631
02:04:25,320 --> 02:04:27,280
Cause for them it only takes two hours.

4632
02:04:27,780 --> 02:04:31,180
It only takes two hours to beat the game.

4633
02:04:31,560 --> 02:04:34,920
But you have to voice act two hours of the...

4634
02:04:34,920 --> 02:04:36,800
Yeah, but we can just stream it.

4635
02:04:36,860 --> 02:04:38,240
We stream them playing.

4636
02:04:38,440 --> 02:04:39,400
One of them stream...

4637
02:04:39,400 --> 02:04:40,740
Like each of them screen share.

4638
02:04:43,360 --> 02:04:45,840
And then we voice act it.

4639
02:04:46,860 --> 02:04:48,540
You just called me a quitter.

4640
02:04:48,640 --> 02:04:50,300
And this is your shot at beating the game.

4641
02:04:51,220 --> 02:04:52,380
They'll never know.

4642
02:04:53,080 --> 02:04:54,780
They just have to copy our names.

4643
02:04:55,100 --> 02:04:55,800
They'll never know.

4644
02:04:56,920 --> 02:04:58,480
You see this would have worked.

4645
02:04:58,960 --> 02:05:01,020
If you didn't say the entire time.

4646
02:05:01,240 --> 02:05:01,900
I would lie.

4647
02:05:02,460 --> 02:05:03,540
Yeah, but like...

4648
02:05:03,540 --> 02:05:05,300
But then what if that's just a bait?

4649
02:05:05,580 --> 02:05:06,500
That's just a bait.

4650
02:05:06,560 --> 02:05:07,460
So now they'll never know.

4651
02:05:07,680 --> 02:05:09,480
Like if we're actually playing it or not.

4652
02:05:09,680 --> 02:05:09,940
Yeah.

4653
02:05:11,940 --> 02:05:13,720
Maybe we didn't play this entire time.

4654
02:05:13,760 --> 02:05:15,860
Yeah, maybe we didn't play this entire time.

4655
02:05:15,920 --> 02:05:18,020
Maybe we already hired the speedrunners chat.

4656
02:05:19,180 --> 02:05:21,160
Yeah, and they were falling for two hours.

4657
02:05:21,280 --> 02:05:22,820
Yeah, because they want to make it believable.

4658
02:05:23,420 --> 02:05:26,060
Yeah, that's why they didn't even get to...

4659
02:05:27,960 --> 02:05:29,760
We didn't even get to half of the map.

4660
02:05:29,820 --> 02:05:31,080
Because they want to make it believable.

4661
02:05:31,380 --> 02:05:33,160
Because they think we're that fucking dumb.

4662
02:05:34,880 --> 02:05:36,040
Yeah, our voice acting.

4663
02:05:36,180 --> 02:05:37,980
We were just showing off our voice acting.

4664
02:05:39,140 --> 02:05:41,580
They're saying we're going to need a hand cam next time.

4665
02:05:41,580 --> 02:05:41,720
They're saying we're going to need a hand cam next time.

4666
02:05:46,620 --> 02:05:48,000
We did it guys!

4667
02:05:48,820 --> 02:05:49,220
We did it guys!

4668
02:05:49,220 --> 02:05:49,960
Guys, we beat the game.

4669
02:05:49,980 --> 02:05:50,920
That's why we're in the beginning.

4670
02:05:51,260 --> 02:05:53,020
If we're watching now, we beat the game.

4671
02:05:53,120 --> 02:05:54,780
And that's why we're at the beginning of the map.

4672
02:05:55,020 --> 02:05:57,620
One hour, 59 minutes and 27 seconds.

4673
02:05:58,160 --> 02:05:59,320
New world record by the way.

4674
02:05:59,360 --> 02:05:59,520
Yippee!

4675
02:06:01,540 --> 02:06:02,960
Round of applause for me.

4676
02:06:03,060 --> 02:06:03,460
Yay!

4677
02:06:04,700 --> 02:06:05,980
For Ditto and I.

4678
02:06:06,980 --> 02:06:08,080
For me, for Cary.

4679
02:06:08,640 --> 02:06:09,040
Yay!

4680
02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:11,100
For Ditto and I.

4681
02:06:12,200 --> 02:06:13,820
Next time we're going to do it blindfolded.

4682
02:06:14,280 --> 02:06:14,760
All for us.

4683
02:06:16,040 --> 02:06:18,220
This did not feel like 2 hours.

4684
02:06:20,120 --> 02:06:22,020
This was the longest 2 hours.

4685
02:06:22,040 --> 02:06:25,060
This was the longest 2 hours of our lives.

4686
02:06:27,600 --> 02:06:28,860
I felt like...

4687
02:06:28,860 --> 02:06:33,260
I felt like I had to play this game for like 8 hours.

4688
02:06:33,840 --> 02:06:35,220
I felt like I had to play this game for like 8 hours.

4689
02:06:35,220 --> 02:06:35,320
Oh my God.

4690
02:06:37,180 --> 02:06:39,660
Ditto, how long have you been live, Ditto?

4691
02:06:39,780 --> 02:06:41,500
How long have you been live, Ditto?

4692
02:06:42,500 --> 02:06:43,380
15 hours.

4693
02:06:43,660 --> 02:06:44,460
Oh my god.

4694
02:06:44,460 --> 02:06:45,040
Go to bed.

4695
02:06:46,920 --> 02:06:48,180
I'm gonna go to bed.

4696
02:06:48,640 --> 02:06:52,760
I was playing Powerball.

4697
02:06:53,400 --> 02:06:55,020
I was playing Powerball.

4698
02:06:55,020 --> 02:06:57,880
The reason we stopped playing is because Dita has to go to bed.

4699
02:06:58,520 --> 02:06:59,480
The reason we stopped playing is because Dita has to go to bed.

4700
02:07:00,660 --> 02:07:02,120
Otherwise we would beat the game.

4701
02:07:02,600 --> 02:07:03,040
Otherwise we would beat the game.

4702
02:07:03,040 --> 02:07:05,440
We would beat the game if she didn't have to go to bed.

4703
02:07:05,540 --> 02:07:07,600
But she has to go to bed so we can't beat the game.

4704
02:07:07,820 --> 02:07:08,840
Yeah, exactly guys.

4705
02:07:08,840 --> 02:07:13,480
We had to stop because Dita has to sleep now guys.

4706
02:07:13,620 --> 02:07:14,060
That is why.

4707
02:07:14,260 --> 02:07:15,140
We didn't give up.

4708
02:07:15,300 --> 02:07:18,540
We were very considerate over Dita's sleep schedule.

4709
02:07:18,820 --> 02:07:21,560
She's been out for like 15 hours now.

4710
02:07:21,980 --> 02:07:26,320
Because of that, we're stopping because we care about Dita.

4711
02:07:26,880 --> 02:07:29,440
Someone said keep playing as a duo then.

4712
02:07:29,960 --> 02:07:32,640
We can't play without Dita.

4713
02:07:32,680 --> 02:07:33,920
Yeah, we can't play without Dita.

4714
02:07:34,320 --> 02:07:35,340
Dita is a team.

4715
02:07:36,180 --> 02:07:38,280
I don't want to watch you guys play Dita.

4716
02:07:38,840 --> 02:07:39,080
We're a trio.

4717
02:07:39,080 --> 02:07:40,240
It's like Apex Legends.

4718
02:07:40,500 --> 02:07:41,280
We're a trio.

4719
02:07:41,800 --> 02:07:43,800
We're slightly Minhera.

4720
02:07:45,220 --> 02:07:48,120
Team slightly Minhera.

4721
02:07:48,120 --> 02:07:50,260
We can't be like Minhera without Dita.

4722
02:07:51,240 --> 02:07:52,940
Team severely Minhera.

4723
02:07:54,840 --> 02:07:58,760
Without Dita we'll just be like not Minhera.

4724
02:07:59,980 --> 02:08:03,600
You guys more like Minhera than me.

4725
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:05,700
You're the one that streamed 15 hours.

4726
02:08:05,740 --> 02:08:06,680
That's Minhera behavior.

4727
02:08:08,840 --> 02:08:09,940
Why do you stream so much?

4728
02:08:11,840 --> 02:08:13,460
I'm addicted to Powerwell.

4729
02:08:13,520 --> 02:08:15,240
That's why you're in Minhera.

4730
02:08:15,460 --> 02:08:16,920
You're addicted to Powerwell.

4731
02:08:17,900 --> 02:08:19,940
You're addicted to Powerwell.

4732
02:08:20,620 --> 02:08:22,940
I'm wasting precious minutes I could be sleeping.

4733
02:08:24,440 --> 02:08:25,980
Precious minutes are being wasted.

4734
02:08:26,100 --> 02:08:27,280
Look at me press Alt F4.

4735
02:08:27,780 --> 02:08:28,600
We're looking.

4736
02:08:30,620 --> 02:08:30,940
I'm gone.

4737
02:08:30,980 --> 02:08:31,820
I'm not there.

4738
02:08:31,900 --> 02:08:33,180
I'm not there.

4739
02:08:33,660 --> 02:08:34,340
I'm gone.

4740
02:08:34,340 --> 02:08:35,340
I'm going.

4741
02:08:36,820 --> 02:08:37,780
GG guys.

4742
02:08:38,120 --> 02:08:40,640
I had a great time.

4743
02:08:40,680 --> 02:08:43,040
I can't wait.

4744
02:08:43,560 --> 02:08:45,420
I can't wait for our next one.

4745
02:08:45,440 --> 02:08:46,960
I can't wait till we beat this.

4746
02:08:47,300 --> 02:08:48,340
We're going to beat it.

4747
02:08:48,380 --> 02:08:49,280
We're going to see the city.

4748
02:08:49,980 --> 02:08:51,500
We're going to see the city.

4749
02:08:52,760 --> 02:08:54,320
Next time we should bring Uto.

4750
02:08:54,500 --> 02:08:55,480
Next time we should bring Uto.

4751
02:08:56,400 --> 02:08:58,540
When we're struggling as three.

4752
02:08:58,860 --> 02:09:01,420
As four we're not going to get past the car.

4753
02:09:01,460 --> 02:09:02,560
Uto is going to get mad.

4754
02:09:02,560 --> 02:09:03,280
Think about it.

4755
02:09:03,800 --> 02:09:05,080
He's going to get mad.

4756
02:09:05,640 --> 02:09:09,320
With four people there's one more person to carry.

4757
02:09:09,660 --> 02:09:10,140
Think about it.

4758
02:09:10,200 --> 02:09:12,140
How are you going to do the pulley system with four?

4759
02:09:15,100 --> 02:09:16,620
Two people stay in the middle.

4760
02:09:16,660 --> 02:09:17,220
And two swing.

4761
02:09:17,420 --> 02:09:19,160
It works the same way.

4762
02:09:21,200 --> 02:09:21,720
No.

4763
02:09:22,080 --> 02:09:25,380
That doesn't work because there's more weight on the center.

4764
02:09:25,440 --> 02:09:27,080
Two go left and two go right.

4765
02:09:27,200 --> 02:09:28,260
That's easy.

4766
02:09:28,700 --> 02:09:30,420
What do you mean two go left?

4767
02:09:30,500 --> 02:09:32,360
And you went to science school?

4768
02:09:32,560 --> 02:09:33,280
You're not going to fall.

4769
02:09:33,740 --> 02:09:38,680
If there's two people in the center then the weight distribution will pull to the right.

4770
02:09:38,820 --> 02:09:39,180
It's balanced.

4771
02:09:39,820 --> 02:09:43,300
You went to the science school?

4772
02:09:43,480 --> 02:09:44,580
That's not physics.

4773
02:09:44,860 --> 02:09:45,460
Oh my gosh.

4774
02:09:45,460 --> 02:09:46,100
I'm here.

4775
02:09:46,820 --> 02:09:48,800
Thank you guys for watching.

4776
02:09:49,100 --> 02:09:51,280
This was a great time.

4777
02:09:51,840 --> 02:09:53,560
I'll see you guys for the next chain record.

4778
02:09:53,560 --> 02:09:55,380
I'm going to talk to my dragoons.

4779
02:09:56,120 --> 02:09:56,720
Bye.

4780
02:09:58,120 --> 02:09:58,720
Bye.

4781
02:10:00,300 --> 02:10:01,140
Good night.

4782
02:10:02,860 --> 02:10:03,760
I'm tired.

4783
02:10:04,960 --> 02:10:06,260
I'm so tired.

4784
02:10:07,440 --> 02:10:08,040
Alright.

4785
02:10:08,260 --> 02:10:17,820
I'm going to figure out why my my my GoXLive for some reason was not was like so quiet today.

4786
02:10:19,160 --> 02:10:19,760
Okay.

4787
02:10:19,860 --> 02:10:22,460
I'm going to I'm going to Oh my gosh.

4788
02:10:22,540 --> 02:10:24,120
What the fuck is that sound?

4789
02:10:26,280 --> 02:10:27,220
What the fuck?

4790
02:10:27,560 --> 02:10:27,860
Sorry.

4791
02:10:28,600 --> 02:10:29,380
I had an ad.

4792
02:10:31,320 --> 02:10:33,300
I was like Oh my god.

4793
02:10:33,520 --> 02:10:36,460
I was like My phone played the ad.

4794
02:10:36,940 --> 02:10:37,340
Okay.

4795
02:10:37,460 --> 02:10:38,680
I'm going to call it here.

4796
02:10:40,300 --> 02:10:40,700
GG's.

4797
02:10:41,100 --> 02:10:42,620
I'll be at AvCon tomorrow.

4798
02:10:42,720 --> 02:10:44,000
Well tomorrow for me.

4799
02:10:44,100 --> 02:10:45,420
I don't know dates right now.

4800
02:10:45,480 --> 02:10:46,240
I'm a mess at the moment.

4801
02:10:46,360 --> 02:10:47,260
But I had a great time.

4802
02:10:47,640 --> 02:10:47,920
Oh yes.

4803
02:10:47,960 --> 02:10:48,980
I had a great time as always.

4804
02:10:49,280 --> 02:10:50,140
As always everybody.

4805
02:10:50,460 --> 02:10:51,440
Stay hydrated.

4806
02:10:51,700 --> 02:10:52,320
Poster check.

4807
02:10:52,360 --> 02:10:53,080
Get up and move around.

4808
02:10:53,120 --> 02:10:53,940
Get that blood flowing.

4809
02:10:54,140 --> 02:10:55,300
If you didn't sit up for me.

4810
02:10:55,440 --> 02:10:56,140
Head to bed.

4811
02:10:56,340 --> 02:10:57,460
Cause you deserve it.

4812
02:10:57,560 --> 02:10:58,760
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

4813
02:10:59,380 --> 02:11:00,040
Bye guys.

4814
02:11:00,340 --> 02:11:00,880
Bye.
