1
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,550
Hello everybody!

2
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,170
Hello, hello!

3
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:59,330
Today is a new exciting day of trying to make technology work.

4
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,350
I see a lot of people are like, the fuck is Seaman?

5
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:08,750
So, I don't know why.

6
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:14,330
Okay, so, this game has lived rent-free in my head for the longest time.

7
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:17,130
And I've always wanted to try this game out.

8
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:21,890
And I've only watched one playthrough of this game.

9
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,170
And it was years ago.

10
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,270
I think it was like...

11
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:31,930
It was 10 plus years ago when PewDiePie did a Let's Play of Seaman.

12
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:40,010
And then, that game has lived rent-free in my head for so fucking long, that like...

13
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,390
I was like, wait a minute.

14
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:46,030
I can... I can play Seaman now.

15
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,670
I've never had a Dreamcast before.

16
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,070
That's not gonna stop me!

17
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:04,830
So, Seaman.

18
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:10,150
You can only play Seaman on the Dreamcast with a very special...

19
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:16,730
With a very special microphone that is fit...

20
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,350
Like a microphone controller or something.

21
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:23,590
And I've never owned a Dreamcast before.

22
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:27,230
Anyway, today we're gonna play...

23
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:30,690
Today, we're gonna play Seaman!

24
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:32,250
Seaman!

25
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:38,910
And it's basically...

26
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:42,390
It's basically like a Tamagotchi.

27
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:51,830
But instead of raising a really cute pet, you're raising a fish of a human man's face.

28
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,970
Who's voiced by Leonard Nimoy.

29
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:01,210
Or back then, because this game was actually released in 2000.

30
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,090
And it was...

31
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:09,590
If you guys didn't know, he's based Leonard Nimoy for the young ones out there, the Gen Zers out there.

32
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,390
And I guess like... Who is the newest Gen Alpha?

33
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,670
Is that the newest one that's growing up right now?

34
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:19,510
This is voiced by Mr. Spock from Star Trek.

35
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,890
Not the... Oh, what's his name?

36
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,670
The newest Spock.

37
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:24,590
I forgot his name.

38
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:25,330
The other guy.

39
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:28,070
I know Chris Pine is the captain.

40
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,750
By the way, I've never actually watched Star Trek before.

41
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,730
Okay, you can... You guys... Okay.

42
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:38,110
I will not judge you if you... Oh, Zach.

43
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,110
Yeah, Zach Quinto.

44
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,130
Yeah, Zachary Quinto.

45
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:44,310
Yes, Zachary Quinto, who's the newest Spock actor.

46
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,010
The heroes guy.

47
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:52,200
Anyway, the only things... The only references I know regarding Star Trek...

48
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,780
Is the ones... Please... Okay.

49
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,600
I allow you guys to judge me when I tell you guys this.

50
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,640
If this is like, the last straw...

51
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,960
This might be the last straw for a lot of you guys.

52
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,240
Especially the older Dragoons.

53
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,000
But the only things I know from Star Trek...

54
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,200
Are the references made...

55
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,050
The references...

56
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,140
By the way, I did not watch that show.

57
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,240
I just... I try to watch the first... Okay.

58
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,820
The references made by Big Bang Theory.

59
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:41,800
Because I try to watch the first... I try to watch the first season.

60
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:47,830
Because back then... Back then, when Big Bang Theory was still running...

61
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,680
It was considered the most popular TV show.

62
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,420
That's in circulation.

63
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,400
That was running.

64
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,380
So I was like... Oh, hey.

65
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,700
Let me check it out.

66
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,480
Let me send this in.

67
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:02,980
Sorry.

68
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,580
I was like... I mean, it won a lot of... It won a lot of...

69
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,460
It won a lot of... What is it?

70
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,100
Like, lots of... Oh my god.

71
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,300
What was the TV awards?

72
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,240
I forgot what it's called.

73
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,000
It was not TV awards.

74
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,080
I'm trying to remember what it was called.

75
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:18,580
The Emmys.

76
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,080
It won a lot of Emmys.

77
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,600
And like, you know, the People's Choice Awards and shit like that.

78
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,460
So I was just like... Let me check it out.

79
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,300
I couldn't get past the first season, as we all know.

80
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:34,840
It's a show.

81
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:40,000
But, I learned a lot about Star Trek, though.

82
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,040
At least I learned a lot.

83
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,980
Guys, I learned a lot about Star Trek, though.

84
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,300
I promise.

85
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,220
Our relationship is over, Toki.

86
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,340
Simple-minded.

87
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,200
Thank you for the super chat.

88
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,120
Thank you, thank you.

89
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:04,220
Wait, I said... Guys, I said like...

90
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:09,140
I didn't actually watched, watched it.

91
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,280
Also, thank you for the...

92
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,900
Thank you, thank you.

93
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:14,260
Hello.

94
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:14,480
Hello.

95
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:22,240
Also, the other times I know about...

96
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,920
I think the other... What was the other thing that made me know more about Star Trek?

97
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:26,800
I'm trying to remember.

98
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,260
Like, because they used to do like... A lot of shows would...

99
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,560
Oh, Patrick Stewart.

100
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,580
Sir Patrick Stewart.

101
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,700
Also, because of...

102
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,980
Also, because of American Dad.

103
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:46,480
Because Sir Patrick Stewart voice acts in American Dad.

104
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:50,060
So he always... They always reference Picard.

105
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,080
They always make references to him.

106
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,620
Since Patrick Stewart is like a character in that show.

107
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:09,000
So I knew a lot about like... A lot about like Picard as well because of it.

108
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,460
Guys, guys, look.

109
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:20,440
American Dad is actually a pretty good show, okay?

110
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,940
It's actually a pretty decent show.

111
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,760
Okay, guys.

112
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,560
El, thank you for the super chat.

113
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,360
Thank you, thank you.

114
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:28,980
That's it.

115
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,220
I'm un-subbing and cancelling myself.

116
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,520
I can't believe my oshi did this to me.

117
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,200
Thank you for the super chat, El.

118
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,160
Thank you, thank you.

119
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,360
Pamper, thank you for the super chat.

120
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,340
Thank you, thank you.

121
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,920
Star Trek, watch along.

122
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,340
Thank you for the super chat.

123
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,260
Thank you, thank you.

124
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,760
Mercy, thank you for the super chat.

125
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,380
Thank you, thank you.

126
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,640
Doki, you're getting us to play by play on Archie.

127
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,640
Why would we expect you to have standards?

128
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:58,580
Look, I admit I have really, really trashy taste when it comes to TV shows, okay?

129
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,220
You know what I used to watch growing up?

130
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,660
I said this before.

131
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:08,380
I know I have trashy taste in TV shows.

132
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,200
Because I used to watch Toddlers in Tiara.

133
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,380
Which is like, really trashy.

134
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:19,440
For those who don't know what Toddlers in Tiara is.

135
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,800
It's like, I talked about this before.

136
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:28,160
But it's when, it's when like, it's like kids beauty pageants.

137
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:32,780
And they like, force feed their children a lot of fucking sugar.

138
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,220
Called like, pixie sticks.

139
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,580
And they're like, perform for us.

140
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,060
Make mommy proud.

141
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,600
Because mommy didn't fucking, wasn't able to do this when she was growing up.

142
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:45,020
So I'm gonna live vicariously through you.

143
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,580
So I used to watch Toddlers in Tiara a lot when I was growing up.

144
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,920
Because I used to actually really enjoy it.

145
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,080
When I was growing up, when I was growing up guys, I don't do that anymore.

146
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,240
Oh yeah, and the go-go juice.

147
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,760
I don't do that anymore, guys.

148
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,360
I like to think that I've matured a lot more.

149
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,300
Now, I just watch children animation.

150
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,760
Now, and comedy sitcoms.

151
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,560
But like, not skip, sorry, not sitcoms.

152
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,460
And comedy shows, like Abbott Elementary.

153
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,500
And, what else do I watch actually?

154
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,940
I don't know, usually I just watch like, animation.

155
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,240
And, oh, I like Crapopolis.

156
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,760
Crapopolis is really good.

157
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:38,340
Speaking of children animation, did you hear that they're planning on trying to cancel Sesame Street?

158
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,960
I was like, what the fuck?

159
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:47,160
We're actually, that's fucking crazy.

160
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:55,620
Yeah, they're trying to get Sesame Street off the air.

161
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,880
And I was like, leave Elmo alone!

162
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,860
What has Elmo done to you?

163
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,150
That's crazy.

164
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:12,760
No, they're actually trying to take Sesame Street off the air.

165
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,740
I was like, what the fuck?

166
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,920
That's fucking insane.

167
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,090
Elmo just wants to hug.

168
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,800
What did Elmo do to you?

169
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,620
Holy fuck.

170
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,420
Anyway, Quantum, thank you for the super chat.

171
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,440
Thank you, thank you.

172
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,820
Hi, Doki, today is my birthday.

173
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,880
Can you get a happy birthday wish from my cameo?

174
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,300
Of course I can!

175
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,000
Happy birthday, Quantum.

176
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,040
Thank you for the super chat.

177
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,840
Thank you, thank you.

178
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:44,180
Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you.

179
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,960
Happy birthday, dear Quantum.

180
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,680
Happy birthday to you.

181
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,760
Wait, he's not the voice of the fish man?

182
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,080
I thought he was.

183
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,580
It sounds just like him.

184
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:58,740
I thought he was the voice of the fish man.

185
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,940
Okay, let me see.

186
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,100
Oh wait, why is it not full screen anymore?

187
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,740
Oh my god, what did I do?

188
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,020
Give me a sec, guys.

189
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,940
I fucked up the game because I tabbed out.

190
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:18,020
I mean, I fucked up the stream thing because I tabbed.

191
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,520
I accidentally closed my Dreamcast.

192
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,320
That's...

193
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,100
That's okay, I figured it out.

194
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,540
I figured it out.

195
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,640
Okay, let's see.

196
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,120
Is this correct?

197
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,960
Okay, okay.

198
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,500
Alright, I'm booting up my Dreamcast right now, guys.

199
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,400
I'm booting it up.

200
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,940
Guys, I'm doing it.

201
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,680
I'm running my...

202
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,780
I'm running...

203
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,740
Well, alright, let me see if my screen capture works.

204
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,300
Let me see if my screen capture works for Seaman.

205
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,900
Is it this?

206
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,520
Which one is... oh, it's this.

207
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,700
There we go.

208
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,300
Alright, do we want to create?

209
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:06,760
Yes.

210
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:08,600
Yeah, I see.

211
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,380
No, guys, don't see that.

212
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:09,640
Okay.

213
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,660
Okay, wait.

214
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,220
Why is my...

215
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,200
Why is it not working?

216
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:16,560
Hello?

217
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:16,940
Hello?

218
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,360
It's not working.

219
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,120
Okay, there we go.

220
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,480
Okay, give me a sec.

221
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,480
My Dream...

222
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,560
My Dreamcast controller...

223
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,540
Okay, give me a sec, guys.

224
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:28,880
I got...

225
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,400
Okay, give me a sec.

226
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,540
I'm trying to figure... Okay, there we go.

227
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:37,820
Okay.

228
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:39,380
Hello?

229
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,020
Oh.

230
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,700
Oh, I accidentally clicked no.

231
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,300
Oh, okay.

232
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:43,940
I got it to work.

233
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,180
Okay.

234
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,260
Wait, what?

235
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:48,860
Okay.

236
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,620
Okay, there we go.

237
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:53,940
Play.

238
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,600
Oh, my God.

239
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,600
Wait, did I...

240
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,520
Oh, it's because I clicked no.

241
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,440
Oh, okay.

242
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,760
Okay, I get it.

243
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,220
Play.

244
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,080
I'm doing it.

245
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,300
I...

246
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:11,780
I've never seen... Guys, I've actually... I've never seen...

247
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,380
What the...

248
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,620
What a Dreamcast looks like.

249
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,120
Until today.

250
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:20,940
Until today.

251
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,720
The menu looks like...

252
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,240
Wait.

253
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:34,820
Yes.

254
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,220
Why won't it let me create new data?

255
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,140
Yes.

256
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,540
Let me...

257
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:42,880
What?

258
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,280
What the fuck?

259
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,740
Why won't it?

260
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,740
Why won't it let me create?

261
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,680
I'm using the D-pad.

262
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,900
It won't let me go to the left.

263
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,380
Okay, we can figure this out.

264
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,320
It's okay, guys.

265
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,620
We can figure this out.

266
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,860
I pressed A.

267
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:10,040
Yay!

268
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,680
Okay, wait.

269
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:16,740
Okay.

270
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,300
Okay.

271
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:21,460
Oh!

272
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,680
I have to use the left trigger!

273
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,280
Oh!

274
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,180
Okay, I'm figuring it out, guys.

275
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,500
It's the left trigger button.

276
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,500
Ryzen, thank you for the super chat!

277
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,500
Thank you, thank you!

278
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:37,740
Okay,

279
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,500
Mr. Seaman.

280
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,410
Do I have a start button?

281
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,350
What's my start button?

282
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:58,910
Guys, give me a sec.

283
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:03,690
Like, I don't think I have a start button.

284
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:04,810
Give me a sec.

285
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,910
Okay, start is...

286
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,190
Okay, there you go.

287
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,970
Guys, sorry, I...

288
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,970
I had to...

289
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:20,050
plug in my controller on and off.

290
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:23,210
And I got... Guys, it's okay, guys.

291
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:26,210
I had to plug in my controller on and off.

292
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:29,390
That's why I had to hide my screen, guys.

293
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:34,430
Yeah?

294
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:36,330
So yeah, it's like a Tamagotchi.

295
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:42,310
Welcome!

296
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,810
Welcome to the tomato farm!

297
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:44,650
Welcome, welcome!

298
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:47,310
Welcome!

299
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,250
Leonard Nimoy!

300
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,490
There he is!

301
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:02,650
Oh, game was a little...

302
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:08,250
You guys don't see that, right?

303
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:09,650
You guys don't...

304
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,230
You guys don't see it, okay.

305
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:18,990
While adjusting, keep in mind that blue is the color of the sea.

306
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:22,290
And thus, an appropriate color for the care of seaman.

307
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:28,130
Then, take the egg from the storage matrix and place it in the tank.

308
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,370
The water's temperature is key...

309
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:32,930
Thank you for the super chat.

310
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:33,890
Thank you, thank you.

311
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:38,310
The Nautilus will play a very important role in seaman's development.

312
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,410
Affiliate, thank you for the five gift issues!

313
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:41,510
Thank you, thank you!

314
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:44,970
I'll be here to offer advice and guidance.

315
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,710
Thank you, Mr. Nimoy!

316
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:50,810
You may press the start button to skip at any time.

317
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,450
Very well.

318
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:55,310
Let us proceed to the tank.

319
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:59,070
Mr. Sand, did you also remember the plug-in that definitely...

320
00:17:59,070 --> 00:17:59,370
Yeah!

321
00:17:59,670 --> 00:17:59,810
Yeah!

322
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:00,290
Yeah!

323
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:02,570
My very real...

324
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:04,010
Okay, here we go.

325
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:10,790
My very real Dreamcast microphone that's attached to my Dreamcast controller right now that I'm holding.

326
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:13,150
Thank you for the super chat.

327
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:14,510
Thank you, thank you.

328
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:18,550
Of course, how else would I get this game to work, guys?

329
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:20,090
Hello?

330
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:21,930
Hello?

331
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,330
Is my seaman here?

332
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,130
Hello, Mr. Seaman?

333
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,410
Where are you?

334
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:32,690
Hello?

335
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:37,270
Would you like to save and end the session?

336
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:38,610
Wait, where is he?

337
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:40,130
Hello?

338
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,790
Wait, do I turn on the lights?

339
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:42,810
Where are my lights?

340
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,650
Where are my lights?

341
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:51,710
Where is it?

342
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,790
How do I turn on light?

343
00:18:58,610 --> 00:18:59,090
Hello?

344
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:01,590
Instructions?

345
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:02,990
Where is my light?

346
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:05,650
Oh my God, where is it?

347
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:06,470
It's so dark.

348
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:09,950
It's so dark, I can't see anything.

349
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:12,470
Okay, wait, I'm clicking everything.

350
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:15,650
Oh, where did you...

351
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:21,350
Oh my God, read the manual.

352
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:27,190
Oh my God, where is it?

353
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:31,170
Oh my God, it's somewhere here.

354
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:33,450
I'm trying to find it.

355
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,490
Turn the... Oh my God, where is it?

356
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:39,070
Mr. Nimoy, where is my light?

357
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:42,330
Wait, that's an egg.

358
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,390
Wait, I want to place...

359
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:51,790
Maybe I'll find it here.

360
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,150
Maybe if I tap everything.

361
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,390
Okay, wait, maybe if I...

362
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:01,810
Can I grab this?

363
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:04,830
I'll grab this.

364
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:08,850
I want to grab it.

365
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,170
Give me the egg.

366
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:14,370
Oh my God, please.

367
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:15,950
I'm tapping.

368
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,510
Where are you?

369
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:29,610
Am I an egg?

370
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:30,530
Oh,

371
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:35,210
I have to...

372
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:35,590
What?

373
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:42,170
Oh, I have to hold...

374
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:42,450
Wait.

375
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,230
Okay.

376
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,050
Did I grab it?

377
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:48,970
No, I didn't.

378
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,730
Okay, we're going to figure this out, guys.

379
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:53,770
We're going to...

380
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:56,890
Oh, I grabbed it.

381
00:20:58,450 --> 00:20:59,870
Wait, how did I do that?

382
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,430
Mr. Nimoy, how did I do that?

383
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:11,010
Mr. Nimoy, I let go of the egg.

384
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,900
Wait, Mr. Nimoy.

385
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,860
I don't let go.

386
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,620
I couldn't help it.

387
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,440
Oh, okay.

388
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,000
Okay.

389
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,380
Where is it?

390
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,020
Where did I drop it?

391
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,080
Where did I drop the egg?

392
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:44,620
Where is it?

393
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,440
Where is it?

394
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:49,940
It made...

395
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,740
It made a plop sound.

396
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,960
It plopped some...

397
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,780
Oh, it's gone.

398
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:57,760
It's gone.

399
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,380
It plopped.

400
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,240
And I don't know where I plopped it.

401
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,020
Where is it?

402
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,120
Mr. Nimoy.

403
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,460
I don't know where it is.

404
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,680
I'm so confused.

405
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,180
Mr. Nimoy.

406
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,760
Oh, my God.

407
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,940
Where did it go?

408
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,220
Where did the egg go?

409
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,120
Okay.

410
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:22,740
Maybe...

411
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:23,780
Okay.

412
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,460
I grab...

413
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,580
Okay.

414
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,400
I'm gonna grab the food pellet, though.

415
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,900
Okay, I'm gonna feed it.

416
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,630
I think it's somewhere in here.

417
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:39,570
I...

418
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:42,090
I'm trying to figure out...

419
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:43,270
I'm trying...

420
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:46,730
I'm trying to figure out where the light switch is, guys.

421
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,590
That's the hardest part.

422
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:53,410
But, Mr. Nimoy, how do I turn on the light?

423
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:55,750
I don't...

424
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:56,510
I'm...

425
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:58,330
I don't know where it is.

426
00:22:58,410 --> 00:22:59,170
It's too dark.

427
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:02,870
You keep making this look harder than Dark Souls.

428
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:05,210
Thank you for the super chat.

429
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:06,170
Thank you.

430
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:07,470
Thank you, Raz.

431
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:08,310
Guys!

432
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:10,030
Where's the light?

433
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:16,010
Where is it?

434
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:20,050
Where is the light?

435
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:21,870
Where is...

436
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:25,010
The tapping is quite loud.

437
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,510
Oh, that's funny, because you can't...

438
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:30,950
You can't adjust sound on the Dreamcast, guys.

439
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:32,690
I'll turn it down, though.

440
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:33,810
Okay.

441
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,070
Wait, it's right there?

442
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:41,030
It's right there?

443
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:41,630
Where?

444
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,750
How do you guys see the light switch?

445
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:47,190
Guys, how...

446
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:48,890
How do you see it?

447
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:51,670
Okay, wait.

448
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:54,090
Okay, what if I end my run?

449
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:57,770
I end my run, and then he'll tell me where the light switch is.

450
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:59,210
Maybe he'll tell me.

451
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:01,290
Don't worry, Mr. Nimoy.

452
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:03,230
Okay.

453
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,690
I believe in him.

454
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:08,070
He'll...

455
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:11,190
He'll tell me, right?

456
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:12,910
Wait.

457
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:15,130
Oh, do I have to turn it on and off?

458
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:19,030
Turn the light off.

459
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:21,370
Oh, I can't even play the game?

460
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,130
Oh, my God, what?

461
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,630
Oh, wait, no, okay.

462
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:29,910
I need to press start.

463
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:30,310
Okay.

464
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:31,610
I'm back in.

465
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:33,930
Don't worry.

466
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:34,650
We're figuring...

467
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:37,950
The first part is trying to figure out where the light switch is, guys.

468
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:39,490
And then I'll talk to my child.

469
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:40,550
Alright.

470
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:42,750
I don't even know where the egg is.

471
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:44,490
Where's the egg?

472
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,500
Where's the egg?

473
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:51,480
Hello?

474
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,760
Where's my child?

475
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,360
Where is it?

476
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,680
Where's the child I put in here?

477
00:24:59,300 --> 00:24:59,540
Where...

478
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,720
Where is he?

479
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,900
Wait, do I even...

480
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:07,080
Where did the child go?

481
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,840
Where is he?

482
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,520
Where is he?

483
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,480
Okay, we have figured it out.

484
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,880
Apparently, it's the D-pad.

485
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:25,970
Guys, I don't have enough.

486
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:29,170
Guys, I need you to know...

487
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:30,310
I don't have en...

488
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:33,170
I don't have enough buttons for this.

489
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:33,910
I...

490
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:39,430
Let me figure this out.

491
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:43,110
Okay.

492
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,450
Okay, I have enough buttons now.

493
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:46,650
I have enough buttons now.

494
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:47,490
I figured it out.

495
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:49,750
Okay.

496
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:51,530
Wait.

497
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,190
It says light.

498
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:58,050
How do I...

499
00:25:58,650 --> 00:25:59,870
I have light.

500
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:01,050
How...

501
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:02,030
How to turn light?

502
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:06,670
Where did...

503
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:07,550
Where's the child?

504
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:09,770
Where...

505
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:11,290
Where is it?

506
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:27,250
Child, where are you?

507
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:31,610
Oh, there he is!

508
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,010
Oh, there he is!

509
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:35,010
Oh my god, there's the child!

510
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:35,570
Okay.

511
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,570
Okay, I figured it out.

512
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:40,990
Okay, there he is.

513
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,450
Okay, and then I'll heat you up.

514
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:43,910
Don't worry, child.

515
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:48,450
Be warm!

516
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,710
I'll warm you up, child!

517
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:55,210
Be warm!

518
00:26:58,630 --> 00:26:59,670
Don't worry!

519
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:01,230
Are you warmed up now?

520
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:03,270
Hello?

521
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:06,330
Wake up!

522
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:09,190
Wake up!

523
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:12,810
Oh shit.

524
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:13,550
Okay, wait.

525
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:14,490
Okay.

526
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:15,690
Don't worry.

527
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:16,670
I'll warm you up.

528
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:21,390
But how do I know if it's cooked or not?

529
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,110
Doki, stop!

530
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:27,370
Oh, hey, look!

531
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:27,950
There's air!

532
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,590
There's air in the system now.

533
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:30,470
Guys.

534
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:33,270
Look, I'm doing it!

535
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,610
I'm a really good fish owner!

536
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:36,630
Is it blue?

537
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:37,470
Oh, it's blue!

538
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:38,730
Look at that!

539
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,050
There's more air now.

540
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:40,910
Look at that!

541
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:44,350
I think I'm a really good...

542
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:46,970
I think I'm a really good caretaker.

543
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:50,290
Why are you sleeping?

544
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:54,230
Wake up, Mr. Nimoy!

545
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:58,030
We're resurrecting you from the grave.

546
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:00,570
So you can be in a VTuber's Let's Play.

547
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:03,130
It's okay, they need more air.

548
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:04,830
We all know fishes need air.

549
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:05,950
100!

550
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:08,970
Gotta make it extra blue!

551
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:09,530
Okay.

552
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:10,970
And then...

553
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:14,970
And then we need...

554
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:16,870
What do we need?

555
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:19,790
Light, air, heater.

556
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:20,230
Okay.

557
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:23,850
No, no!

558
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:25,350
The egg's not dead, guys!

559
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:25,690
Believe!

560
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:29,990
Gotta heat it up!

561
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:32,850
We gotta cook the seaman!

562
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:35,030
Mr. Seaman?

563
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:37,070
Wake up, wake up!

564
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:40,530
We're gonna make you nice and warm!

565
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:42,050
Nice and toasty!

566
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:45,390
Wake up, wake up!

567
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:46,510
Don't...

568
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:47,350
It's fine!

569
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,550
It's just a little cooked!

570
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:50,590
Just, we're gonna...

571
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:52,290
Make sure the brain...

572
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:53,630
Develops a little more.

573
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:54,510
Oh, wait!

574
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:54,950
It's moving!

575
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:56,790
The baby's moving!

576
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:58,390
Oh my God.

577
00:28:59,330 --> 00:28:59,670
Okay.

578
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,470
Okay, now...

579
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:06,090
Okay, and then...

580
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:08,590
Hello?

581
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:10,470
Hello?

582
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:12,150
Hello?

583
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,220
Hello?

584
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,040
Wake up!

585
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,660
Wake up!

586
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:25,720
Come on!

587
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,460
Wake up for me!

588
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,580
I see you!

589
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:35,720
Don't...

590
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,900
Don't be boring!

591
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,760
Wake up and give me content!

592
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,020
Entertain me!

593
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,400
Entertain me right now!

594
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,520
Oh, it's time to advance the clock?

595
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,220
Oh!

596
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,880
Oh, we're gonna cheat!

597
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,780
Okay, let's do that.

598
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,500
Okay, yes.

599
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,980
Yes, okay, we advance the clock.

600
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:00,280
Okay.

601
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:03,060
How far do you think we should advance it?

602
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:03,800
Guys.

603
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:08,700
Wait.

604
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,900
What happens if I...

605
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,440
Wait.

606
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,360
Okay, how do I get to the main menu?

607
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,180
On the Dreamcast.

608
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,000
Guys, let me figure this out.

609
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,260
I need to figure out how to get to the main menu.

610
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,420
We're gonna be time traveling real fast, guys.

611
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,380
Okay, let's see.

612
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,980
I'm gonna look at my controller too, real fast.

613
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,300
Oh, you're right.

614
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:39,640
Okay.

615
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,840
Oh, I forgot.

616
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:43,820
I just press a button.

617
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:45,820
On my...

618
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,680
On the console.

619
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,700
And it should...

620
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,100
It should...

621
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:52,840
Take me back, right?

622
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,200
Take me to the main menu.

623
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,040
Right?

624
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,200
Alright.

625
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,680
That should be it.

626
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:05,660
Is that it?

627
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,240
Oh, nice.

628
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:06,580
Okay.

629
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,180
Settings.

630
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,920
Uh, date and time.

631
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,300
Wait, it does do that.

632
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:13,920
Wait.

633
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:15,380
Oh my...

634
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,580
What if I like...

635
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,580
Okay, but what if I...

636
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,000
How dead is my egg?

637
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:28,510
How...

638
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,930
Maybe he's a full grown adult now.

639
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:42,930
Maybe...

640
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:47,490
Maybe he's an adult, guys.

641
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:48,410
You don't know that.

642
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:50,870
He could be an adult now.

643
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:53,890
Oh my god, it's his birthday.

644
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:54,690
Guys.

645
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:07,930
Oh, shit.

646
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:09,170
Just days, guys.

647
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:13,270
So cool.

648
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:18,770
Oh, he's gonna hatch!

649
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,350
Wait, he's gonna hatch!

650
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:31,970
Guys.

651
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:35,010
Please.

652
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,430
Please be patient.

653
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:40,330
Okay.

654
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:42,250
Okay, Mr. Nemo.

655
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:46,130
Wait.

656
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:51,010
Oh my god.

657
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:52,810
Oh my god, where...

658
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:53,890
Wait, where is he?

659
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:55,930
Where is he?

660
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:58,930
Wait, where did my...

661
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:00,770
Where did my...

662
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,290
Oh, no, not...

663
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:02,730
It's okay.

664
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:03,570
He's okay, right?

665
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,250
Oh, my egg is still there, guys!

666
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:05,670
Look!

667
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:07,830
He's still there!

668
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:09,950
Look at that!

669
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:11,170
No, he's still alive!

670
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:11,850
Look at him!

671
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:17,030
Look, he's still there!

672
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:18,910
He's still there.

673
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:20,370
Look.

674
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:22,610
See, I did not kill the egg.

675
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:23,470
It's still...

676
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:24,590
Happy birthday!

677
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:25,930
It's your...

678
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:29,050
It's your one year old little egg!

679
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:30,690
Happy birthday!

680
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:33,870
He's about to hatch, guys!

681
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:36,090
He's about to hatch!

682
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:38,950
Oh my god!

683
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:40,310
Happy birthday!

684
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:44,610
Okay, now we put on the heat.

685
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:47,630
Okay.

686
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:50,490
It's okay, he's fine.

687
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:54,630
Oh my god!

688
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:55,790
Little guy!

689
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:58,530
It's your birthday, little guy!

690
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:01,790
You gotta get out of there soon!

691
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,730
Can't live in that little egg forever!

692
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:04,830
You gotta pay rent!

693
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:08,270
Okay, let's give him more...

694
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:09,790
More heat real fast.

695
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:12,190
It's okay, it's okay.

696
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,010
He's gonna hatch.

697
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:16,010
Happy birthday to you!

698
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:18,490
Happy birthday to you!

699
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:21,470
Happy birthday, dear little guy!

700
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:23,930
Happy birthday to you!

701
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:24,270
Yay!

702
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:29,410
Okay, let's see.

703
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:30,690
It says...

704
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:32,130
Not above 20.

705
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:33,990
So I'll put it at 19.9.

706
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:43,450
Oh, that's awkward.

707
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,750
How do I lower that?

708
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:52,950
Okay.

709
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:55,190
It's okay.

710
00:34:58,570 --> 00:34:59,690
He'll be fine.

711
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:00,570
He'll be fine.

712
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:06,830
JB, thank you for the superchat!

713
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:07,750
Thank you!

714
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:13,250
Watching Doki talk to Leonard Nimoy and raising a seaman was not on my VTubing bingo card for sure.

715
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:15,550
Thank you for the superchat, GG!

716
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:16,890
Thank you, thank you!

717
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:18,910
It's okay, guys.

718
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,670
Okay, and then...

719
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:23,210
Then we look at him.

720
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:23,750
Hello?

721
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:26,230
Are you gonna hatch now?

722
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:28,830
Hello?

723
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:33,050
Okay, I wanna zoom in.

724
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:33,770
How do I zoom in?

725
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:35,910
Oh my god, he's moving!

726
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:36,730
Oh, there he is!

727
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:39,010
Oh my god, there he is!

728
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:39,550
Look, look!

729
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:41,390
He's so alive!

730
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:45,570
You're so alive, little guy!

731
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:47,850
I knew you're alive!

732
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:49,050
They didn't believe me.

733
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:51,050
They said I killed you, but I would never.

734
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:53,770
I would never commit manslaughter or fish slaughter.

735
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:54,990
Oh my god, look at him!

736
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:56,190
He's getting bigger!

737
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:58,290
I don't know how I zoomed in, though.

738
00:35:58,770 --> 00:35:59,670
How did I do that?

739
00:35:59,750 --> 00:35:59,990
Okay.

740
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:02,830
Oh my god, it's dividing!

741
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,230
It's in seaman!

742
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:10,590
No, he's dividing!

743
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:13,270
He's actually dividing!

744
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,790
Oh my god, it's working!

745
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:18,330
Mitosis!

746
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:22,550
Oh my god, he's making the mitochondria right now!

747
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:23,510
Oh shit.

748
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:24,610
I wanna get closer.

749
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:27,650
Oh my god, keep dividing!

750
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:30,610
Oh my god, it's quadruplets!

751
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:35,270
I'm watching mitosis work in real time!

752
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:39,370
Come on.

753
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:40,130
Finish.

754
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:41,390
Come on.

755
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:43,470
Divide faster!

756
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:46,910
If I tap it, it'll divide faster, right?

757
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:48,690
Oh my god, look!

758
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:49,410
Oh my god, look!

759
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:50,550
He has little tails, too!

760
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:55,930
Oh my god, there's many seamans in there!

761
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:58,450
Come on.

762
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,170
So, is it tapping a lot better now?

763
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:05,610
I'm patient.

764
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:06,290
I'm waiting.

765
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:07,470
Come on, little guy.

766
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,190
Grow up.

767
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,250
Come on!

768
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:11,910
Grow the fuck up!

769
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:15,290
It says five minutes.

770
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:16,870
Has it been five minutes yet?

771
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:20,770
Hello?

772
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:23,710
Hello, child?

773
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:26,130
What if I feed him right now?

774
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:29,070
Okay, let me grab this.

775
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,130
How do I grab this again?

776
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:36,790
I don't remember.

777
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:37,930
Guys, how do I-

778
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,460
Did it work?

779
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,120
Oh, there it is!

780
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,360
Look, seaman!

781
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,460
I got you your food!

782
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,360
This tiny-ass food right here!

783
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,520
You gotta wake up to grab it!

784
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,100
It's right here!

785
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:59,380
Look!

786
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:00,080
Seaman!

787
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,380
It's right here!

788
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:03,860
Wake up!

789
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:09,200
You gotta swim all the way there!

790
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:10,700
Come on, little buddy!

791
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,220
Come on!

792
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,960
Thank you for the akasupa again!

793
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:17,980
Thank you!

794
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,420
Thank you so much!

795
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,760
Thank you for the akasupa!

796
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,520
Thank you- What the fuck?

797
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:26,920
What?

798
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,410
There's multiple?

799
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:34,710
What the fuck is that?

800
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:38,670
Wait, what?

801
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,190
What are they?

802
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:44,930
Oh my god!

803
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:46,630
I thought they'd be fishies!

804
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:49,230
I thought they'd still develop!

805
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:51,730
What are you?

806
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:53,710
Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.

807
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:54,530
Tap, tap, tap.

808
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:56,270
Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.

809
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:00,050
You want more food?

810
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:02,410
Hello?

811
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:03,990
Eh.

812
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:07,050
Oh, I can't place food anymore.

813
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:08,130
There's too much food.

814
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:09,630
But I only placed one food.

815
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:11,090
What do you mean?

816
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:11,410
What do you mean?

817
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:15,270
There's so many of them!

818
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:18,010
Oh my god, it's like a little eye!

819
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:21,010
Oh my god, look at him!

820
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:22,330
He's just stuck up there!

821
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:25,690
Okay, uh...

822
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:28,390
I'll make sure you have enough.

823
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:32,190
Okay, what if I- Oh, oh, they're just...

824
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:34,230
They're just up there.

825
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:37,530
Oh my god, that's freaky!

826
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:40,250
How long do they stay as an eye?

827
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:42,270
No, they're still alive!

828
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:42,650
See?

829
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:43,390
Watch.

830
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:44,890
Look at that!

831
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:50,550
No, 99 point- Yeah, they're like eyes!

832
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:55,630
Doki's the best mother a dragoon could ask for!

833
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:58,870
Koyuki, thank you for the- Oh my god, look at them!

834
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:00,150
They're just rolling around!

835
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:02,350
Wait, tap the shell.

836
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:03,350
What does the shell do?

837
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:05,290
Oh, shell.

838
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:07,390
This is how I was born!

839
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:09,910
Ryusen, thank you for the super chat!

840
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:11,530
Oh my god, wait!

841
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:13,370
There's somebody- Something inside this!

842
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:18,970
Wait, there's a- There's a little thing inside the shell!

843
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:20,810
Oh look, they're like juggling!

844
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:23,970
Oh my god, you guys are so ugly!

845
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:26,030
Oh my god!

846
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:29,650
They'll become more beautiful, right?

847
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:32,810
They'll grow out of their ugly face, right?

848
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:37,090
I don't think I love you.

849
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:45,910
Wait, this stage lasts for four to five days?!

850
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:48,570
Okay, do I need to feed them?

851
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:49,810
Okay.

852
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:53,870
Do I- Do I need to feed these creatures?

853
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:56,690
Wow!

854
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:01,610
Do I need to feed them, guys?

855
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:02,430
I need to- No?

856
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:05,930
Okay, I'll see you in four to five days, little bitch.

857
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:11,990
We're time traveling.

858
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:19,650
Don't worry.

859
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:25,830
We're gonna travel a little- We're gonna travel a little bit.

860
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:28,150
Don't worry.

861
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:30,530
Three to four days.

862
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:30,990
Okay.

863
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:34,790
Wait, when does March- Okay.

864
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:35,510
Okay.

865
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:37,830
One...

866
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:38,510
Two...

867
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:39,810
Three...

868
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:40,810
Four...

869
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:41,330
Five.

870
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:42,030
Alright.

871
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:43,930
There we go.

872
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:45,470
Don't worry.

873
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:47,670
Mom's coming back now.

874
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:49,410
Don't worry.

875
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:51,910
Don't worry.

876
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:53,730
They'll be fine, right?

877
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:57,290
They don't need to eat, right, guys?

878
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:03,090
This woman hasn't fed her kids in five days.

879
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:05,570
I'm calling CPS.

880
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:07,570
It's okay, they'll be fine.

881
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:09,770
They'll be fine.

882
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:11,050
They'll be so healthy.

883
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:14,710
Don't worry.

884
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:16,850
Mama's coming back with food.

885
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:18,770
Don't worry, I'm here now.

886
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:20,090
Oh.

887
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:34,550
Are they okay?

888
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:44,290
Oh yeah, they're pretty fucking ugly.

889
00:42:57,310 --> 00:42:58,070
Oh.

890
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:10,150
Oh.

891
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:12,090
Oh shit.

892
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:17,610
Wait, what happened to the other two?

893
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:20,990
Oh wait, okay.

894
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:21,950
No, three.

895
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:24,170
Oh wait, five died.

896
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:26,510
Okay, survival of the fittest, guys.

897
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:28,290
Survival...

898
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:30,330
That means they're strong.

899
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:31,790
My children...

900
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:34,750
The ones that remain are the strong ones.

901
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:44,790
It's okay.

902
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:46,390
Survival of the fittest.

903
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:49,250
Those other five were not gonna live anyway.

904
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:50,470
In the long run.

905
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:52,630
It's natural selection.

906
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:57,430
If they die by the cord...

907
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:02,110
Fuck, okay.

908
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:08,690
Shit!

909
00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:09,950
Okay.

910
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:17,130
It'll be fine.

911
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:20,070
No, no, no, I'm heating it up, guys.

912
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:25,050
It's what nature wanted.

913
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:27,530
It's what...

914
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:29,890
No, they're not dead!

915
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:31,810
They said three!

916
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:35,350
Three were still alive!

917
00:44:37,850 --> 00:44:38,450
Okay.

918
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:41,670
He literally said three were still alive!

919
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:43,790
Okay.

920
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:45,390
Okay.

921
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:49,950
God, I hope they're breathing.

922
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:53,090
I hope they're breathing right now.

923
00:44:57,090 --> 00:44:57,950
Oh my god.

924
00:44:58,230 --> 00:44:59,610
Oh my god, don't worry.

925
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:03,050
Oh shit!

926
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:04,170
Oh fuck!

927
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:05,090
Don't worry!

928
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:06,510
Oh, I see him!

929
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:08,030
I see him still swimming!

930
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:09,490
I see him swimming!

931
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:10,890
Oh my god!

932
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:11,790
It's okay.

933
00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:14,850
Okay, the ones that are on the ground are clearly dead.

934
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:16,490
I can see that.

935
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:19,810
I can see the dead bodies.

936
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:21,170
But it's okay.

937
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:23,690
There's all...

938
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:25,010
Oh!

939
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:26,150
Oh!

940
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:30,630
Two, four, six, seven...

941
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:31,850
Wait, this one's alive!

942
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:33,210
This one!

943
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:35,150
They're just sleeping!

944
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:36,990
They're just...

945
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:37,190
Oh!

946
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:39,510
Oh, don't...

947
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:43,270
It's okay, one's alive!

948
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:46,250
Okay.

949
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:50,050
Okay.

950
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:51,930
The sole survivor.

951
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:54,090
Alright.

952
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:55,110
Okay.

953
00:45:56,030 --> 00:45:58,070
Let me turn up the heat a little bit more too.

954
00:45:59,230 --> 00:45:59,690
Okay.

955
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:01,250
Hello?

956
00:46:03,870 --> 00:46:05,530
Okay, that's dead.

957
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:07,030
No, that...

958
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:08,330
No, he's definitely dead.

959
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:10,390
Oh!

960
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:11,210
He's alive!

961
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:12,110
Oh my god!

962
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:16,590
Oh my god, he's alive!

963
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:17,570
Master!

964
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:19,070
Oh, hello there!

965
00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:20,250
Hello there!

966
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:23,710
My very much alive son!

967
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:26,230
My survivor!

968
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:29,010
You shall be called...

969
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:30,910
For surviving...

970
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:33,570
You shall be called Dragoon 1!

971
00:46:35,110 --> 00:46:36,550
Wait, actually...

972
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:39,710
You will be my Dragoon...

973
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:43,050
For being the sole survivor...

974
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,410
Of your siblings.

975
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:45,630
My...

976
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:46,350
Wait, no!

977
00:46:46,590 --> 00:46:46,730
Mimo!

978
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:47,670
You're right!

979
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:49,950
You shall be Mimo, just like Mimo!

980
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:54,590
You are the sole survivor of all the other dead fishes out there.

981
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:58,350
He is the chosen one.

982
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:00,310
Wait...

983
00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:01,200
How do I...

984
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:02,590
Oh, they're just gone!

985
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:05,090
The bodies are just...

986
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:06,270
Is he alive?

987
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:09,190
Okay, he is alive.

988
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:10,070
Okay.

989
00:47:10,510 --> 00:47:11,010
Alright.

990
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:13,310
Okay, he is alive.

991
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:15,690
The siblings are dead dead.

992
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:16,930
They're...

993
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:19,010
They're both...

994
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:19,710
It's okay.

995
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:21,190
You're alive, though.

996
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:22,530
Good job.

997
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:27,450
I did not kill your brothers and sisters.

998
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:28,670
I...

999
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:30,450
I see it being a miracle.

1000
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:32,050
Thank you for the super chat.

1001
00:47:32,270 --> 00:47:32,550
Thank you.

1002
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:33,370
Thank you.

1003
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:37,150
Wait, do I bring it to the snail?

1004
00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:39,050
Okay, to the...

1005
00:47:39,050 --> 00:47:39,850
Wait, there's...

1006
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:41,990
Alright, let's bring him to...

1007
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:43,710
Let's bring him to this guy.

1008
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:45,570
He's a key...

1009
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:06,980
What happened?

1010
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:08,560
What?

1011
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:10,680
What?

1012
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:11,640
What?

1013
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:25,690
Oh, he just...

1014
00:48:35,930 --> 00:48:40,370
How we live five minutes like...

1015
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:43,770
Does he evolve?

1016
00:48:44,050 --> 00:48:45,210
Does he...

1017
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,610
Wait, do I...

1018
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:53,590
I...

1019
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:54,960
Is he dead?

1020
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:56,460
Is he dead?

1021
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:58,100
Does he...

1022
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:01,180
Does he evolve at the shell?

1023
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:05,360
He evolved into lunch.

1024
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,380
He'll be fine, right?

1025
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,140
Guys.

1026
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,240
He's gonna be fine, right?

1027
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,260
Right, guys?

1028
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:21,320
Now it's being like, yoink.

1029
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:23,540
My, thank you for the super chat.

1030
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:25,320
Thank you, thank you.

1031
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:26,680
Oh, wait.

1032
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:29,720
Hello?

1033
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:32,420
Hello?

1034
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:35,440
Are you gonna poop up my son?

1035
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:40,780
I don't remember fighting me or anything like this.

1036
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,860
Thank you for the super chat, reason.

1037
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:43,920
Hello?

1038
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:45,940
Can you poop him up?

1039
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:46,800
For me.

1040
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:51,380
Oh my god.

1041
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:53,000
What do I do?

1042
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:57,080
How long does this...

1043
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:58,580
He's just evolving, right?

1044
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:00,040
He's just...

1045
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:02,200
Guys, he's just evolving, right?

1046
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,280
He's still in there alive.

1047
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:07,240
Right?

1048
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:13,600
What?

1049
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:14,040
Unlucky.

1050
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:15,260
Thank you for the super chat.

1051
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:16,280
Thank you, thank you.

1052
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:20,220
Donkey, maybe you're not meant to be taking care of the sea man after all.

1053
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:22,240
Or any sea creatures.

1054
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,300
Thank you for the super chat.

1055
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:25,720
Thank you, thank you.

1056
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:27,760
Smelly, thank you for the super chat.

1057
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:28,800
Thank you, thank you.

1058
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:29,860
Guys.

1059
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:31,160
Guys.

1060
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:33,100
Is he alive?

1061
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:35,960
Is he alive in there?

1062
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:43,060
He was supposed to be the strongest one out of all the children.

1063
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:47,320
He survived five days without air.

1064
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,220
What happened?

1065
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,420
Get him out.

1066
00:50:58,680 --> 00:50:59,400
CPS.

1067
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:00,280
Hi, Donkey.

1068
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:03,440
We heard there was child abuse going on.

1069
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:04,820
Wait, where's the kid?

1070
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:08,640
Can't be child abuse if there's no more children in the tank.

1071
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:10,880
Thank you for the super chat, Momo.

1072
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:12,780
Thank you, thank you.

1073
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,500
There's no way.

1074
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:17,340
How am I doing it the way?

1075
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:22,040
Oh my god, there must be evolution.

1076
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:24,880
It must be evolution at work.

1077
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:25,920
Right?

1078
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:28,360
Wake up, little guy.

1079
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:30,060
Wake up.

1080
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:36,000
What if I advance time a little bit?

1081
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:37,700
Just a little bit.

1082
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:40,340
Don't worry, little guy.

1083
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:45,700
I'll advance five more days.

1084
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,160
Just wait.

1085
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:52,960
Guys, no.

1086
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,600
We don't need a restart.

1087
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,860
How long do I have to wait?

1088
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:00,480
Mr. Meat Boy.

1089
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,360
Mr. Meat Boy, tell me.

1090
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:04,440
How long?

1091
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:10,920
Oh, one day.

1092
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:12,540
Okay, don't worry.

1093
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,180
I'll come back for you, child.

1094
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:15,820
I'll come back.

1095
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:16,960
Don't worry.

1096
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:17,500
Okay.

1097
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,240
Okay, one day.

1098
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,200
It should be fine.

1099
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:22,080
The tank should be fine after a day.

1100
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:23,180
Right?

1101
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,160
I believe.

1102
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:26,120
Yes.

1103
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:30,680
I believe they can survive after one day.

1104
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:46,300
Well, good for you.

1105
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,760
You get to watch one of them get eaten by a crab.

1106
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,060
Alright.

1107
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:54,280
Things will be fine.

1108
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:57,760
Wait, was this...

1109
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,280
Okay, everything will be fine.

1110
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:01,560
One day.

1111
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:02,580
One whole day.

1112
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:05,980
Okay.

1113
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:10,180
Mr. Meat Boy, I'm back.

1114
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:16,530
I'm back, Mr. Meat Boy.

1115
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:23,100
He'll be the...

1116
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:26,780
If he lives, he'll be the strongest fish out there.

1117
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:28,660
No fish...

1118
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:30,820
No fish can challenge him.

1119
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:33,040
It's called tough love.

1120
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,580
What?

1121
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:49,920
What?

1122
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:08,460
When the mushroomers emerge from the egg, use the right trigger to tap on the nautilus at the bottom of the tank.

1123
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:14,060
If you continue to tap, the mushroomers will float toward the nautilus.

1124
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:17,060
What happens next may surprise you.

1125
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:18,720
He ate them!

1126
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:22,840
He ate...

1127
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:24,380
What?

1128
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:26,060
He ate them!

1129
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,360
It...

1130
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:31,920
Was...

1131
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:37,740
He...

1132
00:54:43,450 --> 00:54:46,450
Was he supposed to eat all of them?

1133
00:54:54,590 --> 00:54:56,670
I'm supposed to have...

1134
00:54:56,670 --> 00:54:59,810
I'm supposed to have more of them in him?

1135
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:05,410
What do you mean?

1136
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:08,750
What?

1137
00:55:10,330 --> 00:55:12,350
There should have been more?

1138
00:55:13,350 --> 00:55:15,990
What do you mean there should have been more?

1139
00:55:24,390 --> 00:55:26,710
Raza, thank you for the super chat.

1140
00:55:26,850 --> 00:55:28,010
Thank you, thank you.

1141
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:32,090
It's not a challenge for you because there's no word chat.

1142
00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:34,210
I don't understand!

1143
00:55:36,550 --> 00:55:37,130
I...

1144
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:40,890
He told me to feed the children!

1145
00:55:43,070 --> 00:55:46,610
Okay, clearly I need to feed more, right?

1146
00:55:48,810 --> 00:55:49,450
Alright.

1147
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:54,370
Let me put... Wait, I don't have any more eggs.

1148
00:55:56,030 --> 00:55:56,730
Wait.

1149
00:55:58,390 --> 00:55:59,230
Whoops.

1150
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:02,630
It'll go down, naturally.

1151
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:04,470
Wait.

1152
00:56:04,470 --> 00:56:04,610
Wait.

1153
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,340
I need to press B to restart?

1154
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:15,020
How do I restart?

1155
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:19,100
Oh, I have to make a new save file?

1156
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:21,820
I have to do... Goodbye, crap.

1157
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:23,020
Goodbye.

1158
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:25,100
Goodbye.

1159
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:29,260
I'm sorry, I couldn't save you.

1160
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:36,740
How did I fuck up my Tamagotchi already?

1161
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:40,320
Wait, did I kill them?

1162
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,420
Wait, is he dead?

1163
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:45,040
Wait, did I kill the crab?

1164
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:49,100
How many did I kill?

1165
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:54,920
I even killed...

1166
00:56:59,470 --> 00:57:01,550
What's wrong with me?

1167
00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:05,650
What's wrong with me?

1168
00:57:05,870 --> 00:57:07,790
I've killed them all.

1169
00:57:09,170 --> 00:57:11,390
Oh my god, don't bring me back here.

1170
00:57:11,510 --> 00:57:13,950
Don't bring me back here.

1171
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:18,510
Okay.

1172
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:21,610
Get me out.

1173
00:57:22,490 --> 00:57:24,470
Okay, I figured it out.

1174
00:57:27,130 --> 00:57:30,010
This is a tank of death.

1175
00:57:30,610 --> 00:57:31,950
Oh my god!

1176
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:36,030
He even died 0-9-0.

1177
00:57:36,270 --> 00:57:37,350
Good ratio.

1178
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:42,590
But he ate one of them.

1179
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:47,180
The Nautilus got to eat one of them.

1180
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:52,300
Oh my god.

1181
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:54,420
Was I just...

1182
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:57,780
Was I just not meant to race Seaman?

1183
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:00,650
Was I just...

1184
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:04,800
Was I just never meant to race Seaman?

1185
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:08,820
Oh, I actually pressed start.

1186
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:10,120
God damn it!

1187
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:10,860
Get me out of here!

1188
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,700
I don't want to see my dead kids!

1189
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:13,940
Get me!

1190
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:15,840
Stop.

1191
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:19,460
I don't want to see my dead children.

1192
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:22,780
Okay.

1193
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:24,620
Alright.

1194
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:25,580
Okay, here.

1195
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:26,900
This is where I hold.

1196
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:28,320
Do I have to restart my game?

1197
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:29,760
Or like...

1198
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,400
Or like, can I just do it here?

1199
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:34,700
I'm holding B though.

1200
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:40,470
This is my purgatory.

1201
00:58:42,530 --> 00:58:44,250
I am holding it!

1202
00:58:44,930 --> 00:58:48,430
It won't let me delete my save file!

1203
00:58:53,570 --> 00:58:55,390
I'm holding it!

1204
00:58:57,550 --> 00:58:59,470
Oh, hold B when you press start.

1205
00:58:59,590 --> 00:59:00,190
Oh!

1206
00:59:01,230 --> 00:59:02,430
I did that.

1207
00:59:03,970 --> 00:59:05,270
Did I do it?

1208
00:59:06,950 --> 00:59:07,750
Yeah?

1209
00:59:08,370 --> 00:59:11,030
Oh my god, I'm fucking trapped in my purgatory.

1210
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:12,530
I'm trapped.

1211
00:59:12,530 --> 00:59:14,190
It won't let me...

1212
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:21,530
It won't let me go.

1213
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:24,310
It's not letting me go.

1214
00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:25,790
No!

1215
00:59:26,710 --> 00:59:28,510
Get me out of here!

1216
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:30,530
I don't want to be here!

1217
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:34,970
Okay.

1218
00:59:36,770 --> 00:59:39,270
Restart and hold B the entire time.

1219
00:59:40,050 --> 00:59:40,450
Okay.

1220
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:47,450
Okay, we gotta delete the save file.

1221
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:54,530
Goodbye.

1222
00:59:54,770 --> 00:59:55,890
See you, man.

1223
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:57,230
Is this one?

1224
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:00,270
Okay.

1225
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:04,150
Goodbye.

1226
01:00:07,410 --> 01:00:09,230
Like, it never happened.

1227
01:00:09,670 --> 01:00:10,350
It's like...

1228
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:13,570
Guys, it's like it never happened, guys.

1229
01:00:14,170 --> 01:00:15,930
I... The children never existed.

1230
01:00:16,610 --> 01:00:19,670
If it never existed, I never killed any kids.

1231
01:00:19,670 --> 01:00:20,590
Guys.

1232
01:00:21,890 --> 01:00:24,070
If you think about it.

1233
01:00:24,410 --> 01:00:26,410
If you think about it.

1234
01:00:26,730 --> 01:00:28,410
It's like it never happened.

1235
01:00:28,770 --> 01:00:30,010
I never...

1236
01:00:30,010 --> 01:00:32,670
I never... The children...

1237
01:00:33,870 --> 01:00:34,350
You see?

1238
01:00:34,610 --> 01:00:36,770
No memory of it ever happening.

1239
01:00:37,350 --> 01:00:38,970
No memory.

1240
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:43,090
The stream just started for Seamad.

1241
01:00:44,610 --> 01:00:47,230
It's like it just happened, guys.

1242
01:00:51,330 --> 01:00:51,850
Guys.

1243
01:00:52,450 --> 01:00:56,930
Oh my god, I can't wait to try out Seamad for the very first time, guys.

1244
01:00:57,150 --> 01:00:58,410
I'm so excited.

1245
01:00:58,910 --> 01:01:02,210
I wonder what's... I wonder how the ink's gonna be hatched, guys.

1246
01:01:02,910 --> 01:01:03,430
I...

1247
01:01:05,690 --> 01:01:08,490
Oh, okay.

1248
01:01:08,890 --> 01:01:10,450
That's interesting, Mr. Memoy.

1249
01:01:17,230 --> 01:01:18,090
Oh, yeah.

1250
01:01:18,390 --> 01:01:19,630
How do they evolve?

1251
01:01:21,430 --> 01:01:25,950
I can't believe this game didn't outsell Super Mario 64.

1252
01:01:26,490 --> 01:01:27,770
Guys, thank you for the super chat.

1253
01:01:27,890 --> 01:01:28,750
Thank you, thank you.

1254
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:34,850
Yeah, my very first day, Mr. Memoy.

1255
01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:35,730
You're so right.

1256
01:01:36,090 --> 01:01:36,890
It is.

1257
01:01:38,610 --> 01:01:39,510
You're so right.

1258
01:01:49,070 --> 01:01:51,870
Mm-hmm.

1259
01:02:05,470 --> 01:02:08,270
Uh-huh.

1260
01:02:17,350 --> 01:02:18,310
Mm-hmm.

1261
01:02:21,350 --> 01:02:21,830
Alright,

1262
01:02:25,870 --> 01:02:27,850
my very first time playing Seamad.

1263
01:02:28,190 --> 01:02:30,990
So how do I... I wonder... Oh my gosh.

1264
01:02:31,810 --> 01:02:34,030
I wonder how this game is gonna be like, guys.

1265
01:02:34,730 --> 01:02:37,030
I've always seen like videos and let's play of it.

1266
01:02:37,470 --> 01:02:40,410
Uh, so like... But I don't really remember much.

1267
01:02:40,570 --> 01:02:43,030
Alright, so... Oh, it's dark right now.

1268
01:02:43,350 --> 01:02:45,390
I guess I have to turn on the light?

1269
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:47,470
How do I turn on the light?

1270
01:02:48,190 --> 01:02:49,550
Oh, there's the heater.

1271
01:02:50,450 --> 01:02:50,910
Oh, wait.

1272
01:02:50,950 --> 01:02:52,230
There's the light over there.

1273
01:02:52,410 --> 01:02:54,510
Oh, I guess I turn it on.

1274
01:02:55,050 --> 01:02:55,630
And then...

1275
01:02:56,430 --> 01:03:00,790
Also, like Mr. Memoy said, I have to turn on the air.

1276
01:03:05,150 --> 01:03:07,990
My... Wow, I'm learning so fast, guys!

1277
01:03:08,970 --> 01:03:12,750
Some would say I'm a natural at raising Seamad.

1278
01:03:16,150 --> 01:03:18,210
Man, I'm such a good listener!

1279
01:03:20,850 --> 01:03:23,530
Alright, let me put this up here.

1280
01:03:24,930 --> 01:03:27,390
I wish there was a faster way to get the air up.

1281
01:03:27,530 --> 01:03:28,590
It's so slow.

1282
01:03:29,610 --> 01:03:30,730
Oh my god.

1283
01:03:31,090 --> 01:03:32,750
It's actually incredibly slow.

1284
01:03:33,190 --> 01:03:34,290
Turning up the air.

1285
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:39,960
Okay, what if I put... I'm gonna put the egg in right now.

1286
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:43,740
I can't be bothered to wait for this.

1287
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:48,060
Come on, pick it up.

1288
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:50,120
There you go.

1289
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:54,240
Now, heat it up too.

1290
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,180
I'll just do the heating now.

1291
01:04:02,550 --> 01:04:05,550
Guys, this is my first time playing Seamad.

1292
01:04:06,130 --> 01:04:08,930
If it isn't, wouldn't I have like...

1293
01:04:09,630 --> 01:04:11,250
A save file for it already?

1294
01:04:11,630 --> 01:04:12,090
You know?

1295
01:04:12,790 --> 01:04:15,690
Wouldn't I have a previous memory...

1296
01:04:16,290 --> 01:04:18,730
Of me playing Seamad?

1297
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:20,490
There wasn't any.

1298
01:04:20,770 --> 01:04:24,310
So clearly, this is my very first time playing it.

1299
01:04:31,070 --> 01:04:33,730
Okay, we'll get it at...

1300
01:04:36,030 --> 01:04:37,330
Where is it stopping?

1301
01:04:40,050 --> 01:04:40,650
17...

1302
01:04:40,650 --> 01:04:44,730
I wanna stop it at closer to 19 so I don't have to worry about...

1303
01:04:45,430 --> 01:04:47,810
I don't have to worry about like...

1304
01:04:48,730 --> 01:04:49,930
Him dying later.

1305
01:04:50,610 --> 01:04:52,390
Cause he'll never die, by the way.

1306
01:04:53,030 --> 01:04:54,810
Not that he will or anything.

1307
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:56,150
Not that.

1308
01:04:58,030 --> 01:04:59,730
Airborne, thank you for the super chat.

1309
01:04:59,830 --> 01:05:00,730
Thank you, thank you.

1310
01:05:01,210 --> 01:05:04,230
More like, live freely and suffer.

1311
01:05:05,450 --> 01:05:07,890
Thank you for the super chat, Airborne.

1312
01:05:08,050 --> 01:05:09,030
Thank you, thank you.

1313
01:05:09,570 --> 01:05:12,850
Alright, now that he's at 100% air...

1314
01:05:12,850 --> 01:05:14,510
He's gonna start growing now, right?

1315
01:05:16,270 --> 01:05:17,830
Okay, so like...

1316
01:05:18,770 --> 01:05:20,730
When they hatch...

1317
01:05:21,390 --> 01:05:23,590
When he hatches...

1318
01:05:23,590 --> 01:05:25,830
Do I have to actually wait 5 days?

1319
01:05:27,450 --> 01:05:28,730
Or like...

1320
01:05:28,730 --> 01:05:30,790
Can they get eaten up like instantly?

1321
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:36,330
Still doesn't need food.

1322
01:05:36,870 --> 01:05:37,870
This is their food.

1323
01:05:38,350 --> 01:05:38,970
Right here.

1324
01:05:40,990 --> 01:05:41,630
No?

1325
01:05:42,010 --> 01:05:43,310
That part comes later?

1326
01:05:44,250 --> 01:05:45,710
Okay, so I'll check him tomorrow.

1327
01:05:45,710 --> 01:05:46,470
I...

1328
01:05:50,150 --> 01:05:51,190
Good man.

1329
01:05:51,490 --> 01:05:52,930
Thank you for the super chat.

1330
01:05:53,050 --> 01:05:54,270
Thank you, thank you.

1331
01:05:56,730 --> 01:05:58,230
Don't worry, he'll be fine.

1332
01:05:58,710 --> 01:05:59,790
No, just...

1333
01:05:59,790 --> 01:06:00,610
No, no, wait.

1334
01:06:00,870 --> 01:06:02,690
Day by day is good.

1335
01:06:02,990 --> 01:06:04,830
Okay, I'll check up on you tomorrow.

1336
01:06:05,190 --> 01:06:05,510
Okay?

1337
01:06:05,890 --> 01:06:06,410
Okay.

1338
01:06:06,670 --> 01:06:08,490
I'm gonna wait for you to hatch.

1339
01:06:08,790 --> 01:06:11,650
And then I'll check up on you guys tomorrow.

1340
01:06:11,910 --> 01:06:14,210
So don't die on me.

1341
01:06:19,510 --> 01:06:20,550
I don't...

1342
01:06:20,550 --> 01:06:25,370
I believe in these little guys to definitely live tomorrow.

1343
01:06:30,310 --> 01:06:31,830
Thank you for the Akasupa.

1344
01:06:32,070 --> 01:06:32,930
Thank you, thank you.

1345
01:06:33,350 --> 01:06:37,130
I'm very much looking forward to watching Tokibert playing Seaman for the very first time.

1346
01:06:37,530 --> 01:06:40,790
I sure hope that egg has a long and fruitful life.

1347
01:06:41,410 --> 01:06:42,510
Thank you for the Akasupa.

1348
01:06:42,770 --> 01:06:43,830
Thank you, thank you.

1349
01:06:45,190 --> 01:06:47,290
Thank you so much for all the Akasupas.

1350
01:06:47,310 --> 01:06:48,730
I really appreciate it.

1351
01:06:48,790 --> 01:06:50,190
Thank you for the support, man.

1352
01:06:50,930 --> 01:06:51,550
Interesting man.

1353
01:06:51,650 --> 01:06:52,470
Thank you for the super chat.

1354
01:06:52,610 --> 01:06:53,370
Thank you, thank you.

1355
01:06:53,990 --> 01:06:58,110
Hey Doki, just my pet fish a month ago and finally got over it.

1356
01:06:58,170 --> 01:06:59,110
Checking your stream this year.

1357
01:07:02,210 --> 01:07:03,470
What's this game about?

1358
01:07:03,870 --> 01:07:07,110
Oh, you know, this is my very first time raising Seaman.

1359
01:07:07,830 --> 01:07:14,010
I'm gonna make sure all these kids live for at least another day.

1360
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:15,790
Thank you for the super chat.

1361
01:07:15,890 --> 01:07:16,850
Thank you, thank you.

1362
01:07:17,270 --> 01:07:18,610
Zero, thank you for the super chat.

1363
01:07:18,730 --> 01:07:19,570
Thank you, thank you.

1364
01:07:19,870 --> 01:07:21,890
Another episode of Collective Amnesia.

1365
01:07:21,910 --> 01:07:23,590
What are you talking about?

1366
01:07:24,050 --> 01:07:24,910
What are you talking about?

1367
01:07:25,070 --> 01:07:30,750
I have only one memory of raising Seaman and it's this one.

1368
01:07:30,830 --> 01:07:32,270
There's no other file.

1369
01:07:32,770 --> 01:07:35,450
I only have one file of the children.

1370
01:07:35,450 --> 01:07:37,610
And they're all still alive.

1371
01:07:38,310 --> 01:07:39,670
Thank you for the super chat.

1372
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:40,830
Thank you, thank you.

1373
01:07:41,790 --> 01:07:44,750
Come on, they're supposed to hatch any moment now.

1374
01:07:45,110 --> 01:07:46,150
Come on, hatch.

1375
01:07:46,430 --> 01:07:47,490
Hatch, little guys.

1376
01:07:48,070 --> 01:07:48,530
Come on.

1377
01:07:48,910 --> 01:07:50,950
Hatch up so you can get eaten by this guy.

1378
01:07:51,690 --> 01:07:52,350
Hatch up.

1379
01:07:55,470 --> 01:07:56,690
Oh, there they are.

1380
01:07:57,270 --> 01:07:58,270
Come on, little guys.

1381
01:07:58,450 --> 01:07:59,030
Right here.

1382
01:07:59,910 --> 01:08:00,630
Right here.

1383
01:08:00,890 --> 01:08:01,470
Come on.

1384
01:08:02,510 --> 01:08:03,650
Right here, guys.

1385
01:08:04,790 --> 01:08:06,450
It's food time.

1386
01:08:07,390 --> 01:08:08,470
Come on.

1387
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:09,770
Dinner time.

1388
01:08:11,790 --> 01:08:13,070
Right here.

1389
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:17,870
The miracle of birth just happened.

1390
01:08:19,370 --> 01:08:20,330
Where did they go?

1391
01:08:21,710 --> 01:08:22,750
Where did they all go?

1392
01:08:23,970 --> 01:08:24,670
Oh, there they are.

1393
01:08:25,050 --> 01:08:25,950
Oh my, there they are.

1394
01:08:26,670 --> 01:08:27,430
Right here.

1395
01:08:28,390 --> 01:08:28,970
All of you.

1396
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:30,510
All of you, get over here.

1397
01:08:31,210 --> 01:08:31,990
All of you.

1398
01:08:31,990 --> 01:08:33,530
Right here.

1399
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:37,750
That's right.

1400
01:08:38,150 --> 01:08:39,670
Get over here.

1401
01:08:40,030 --> 01:08:41,730
Every single one of you.

1402
01:08:42,350 --> 01:08:45,070
The miracle of childbirth right here.

1403
01:08:47,710 --> 01:08:48,970
Come on.

1404
01:08:49,670 --> 01:08:50,390
Come on.

1405
01:08:50,490 --> 01:08:51,310
There we go.

1406
01:08:51,810 --> 01:08:52,650
There we go.

1407
01:08:52,730 --> 01:08:53,330
One.

1408
01:08:54,890 --> 01:08:55,910
Come on.

1409
01:08:56,650 --> 01:08:58,610
We need another one.

1410
01:09:00,430 --> 01:09:01,310
One.

1411
01:09:02,710 --> 01:09:03,370
Come on.

1412
01:09:03,410 --> 01:09:04,850
Aren't you hungry, little guy?

1413
01:09:04,930 --> 01:09:05,710
Aren't you hungry?

1414
01:09:08,070 --> 01:09:08,550
Okay.

1415
01:09:08,970 --> 01:09:09,330
One.

1416
01:09:11,510 --> 01:09:12,210
Come on.

1417
01:09:12,370 --> 01:09:13,050
Oh, oh, oh.

1418
01:09:13,190 --> 01:09:13,630
Come on.

1419
01:09:13,890 --> 01:09:15,290
No, you're still hungry.

1420
01:09:17,610 --> 01:09:18,950
Aren't you still hungry?

1421
01:09:22,970 --> 01:09:23,450
Two.

1422
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:28,610
Okay.

1423
01:09:29,630 --> 01:09:30,110
Alright.

1424
01:09:30,290 --> 01:09:31,370
How much more to go?

1425
01:09:31,510 --> 01:09:31,730
Okay.

1426
01:09:31,730 --> 01:09:32,430
Two.

1427
01:09:34,110 --> 01:09:34,610
Come on.

1428
01:09:34,810 --> 01:09:36,050
You're still hungry, aren't you?

1429
01:09:36,410 --> 01:09:37,090
Aren't you?

1430
01:09:37,850 --> 01:09:38,490
Three.

1431
01:09:40,010 --> 01:09:41,370
Are you still hungry?

1432
01:09:41,530 --> 01:09:42,270
Oh, whoa, whoa.

1433
01:09:43,270 --> 01:09:43,790
Alright.

1434
01:09:44,890 --> 01:09:45,610
Three.

1435
01:09:47,270 --> 01:09:47,690
Alright.

1436
01:09:49,350 --> 01:09:49,970
Come on.

1437
01:09:51,610 --> 01:09:52,630
Come on.

1438
01:09:52,970 --> 01:09:53,390
Four.

1439
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:55,790
Go, go.

1440
01:09:57,010 --> 01:09:57,490
Oh.

1441
01:09:58,990 --> 01:10:00,070
So hungry.

1442
01:10:05,450 --> 01:10:07,890
How hungry are you, big boy?

1443
01:10:08,450 --> 01:10:09,110
Five.

1444
01:10:09,790 --> 01:10:10,850
That's right.

1445
01:10:11,270 --> 01:10:11,890
Come on.

1446
01:10:12,630 --> 01:10:14,300
Don't you want to eat more?

1447
01:10:15,510 --> 01:10:17,110
Yes, you do.

1448
01:10:17,530 --> 01:10:21,090
I can give you all the kids you want.

1449
01:10:23,630 --> 01:10:24,950
Five, six.

1450
01:10:25,230 --> 01:10:26,590
Yum, yum, yum.

1451
01:10:27,330 --> 01:10:27,710
Oh, wait.

1452
01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:28,470
I lost count.

1453
01:10:28,550 --> 01:10:29,390
It's actually seven.

1454
01:10:30,050 --> 01:10:31,070
Yum, yum, yum.

1455
01:10:31,290 --> 01:10:33,270
One last chance.

1456
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:36,450
Yum, yum, yum, yum.

1457
01:10:36,710 --> 01:10:37,890
Get more.

1458
01:10:38,510 --> 01:10:39,030
Yes!

1459
01:10:39,290 --> 01:10:39,930
There we go.

1460
01:10:40,870 --> 01:10:41,550
There we go.

1461
01:10:41,610 --> 01:10:42,170
We did it.

1462
01:10:43,370 --> 01:10:43,890
Alright.

1463
01:10:44,170 --> 01:10:45,230
That should be it, right?

1464
01:10:46,630 --> 01:10:48,110
Now he ate all the kids.

1465
01:10:50,150 --> 01:10:51,330
Are you satisfied?

1466
01:10:53,410 --> 01:10:54,770
What happened to him?

1467
01:10:56,130 --> 01:10:57,130
Wait, is he dying?

1468
01:10:57,870 --> 01:10:58,230
Oh, wait.

1469
01:10:58,270 --> 01:10:58,610
No, okay.

1470
01:10:58,630 --> 01:10:59,030
He's fine.

1471
01:10:59,570 --> 01:10:59,910
Okay.

1472
01:11:00,150 --> 01:11:00,990
He's fine now.

1473
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:02,090
Alright, nice.

1474
01:11:02,150 --> 01:11:02,630
We did it.

1475
01:11:02,790 --> 01:11:03,870
We fed all the kids.

1476
01:11:06,890 --> 01:11:07,330
Yeah.

1477
01:11:08,470 --> 01:11:09,430
We did it.

1478
01:11:09,810 --> 01:11:11,310
Oh, so what's gonna happen now?

1479
01:11:13,550 --> 01:11:16,090
Like, what do I do now?

1480
01:11:22,930 --> 01:11:25,990
So, now that all the kids are gone...

1481
01:11:27,390 --> 01:11:28,870
What happens now?

1482
01:11:29,330 --> 01:11:30,430
Do I have to wait a day?

1483
01:11:33,550 --> 01:11:36,370
Okay, let me put it at 20.

1484
01:11:38,010 --> 01:11:40,490
All the kids are dead, so...

1485
01:11:40,490 --> 01:11:41,270
I don't know.

1486
01:11:41,570 --> 01:11:43,850
I didn't think this far.

1487
01:11:45,450 --> 01:11:48,750
It won't even let me, like, expand out.

1488
01:11:50,270 --> 01:11:51,770
Do you think he'll be okay?

1489
01:11:53,210 --> 01:11:53,850
10 minutes?

1490
01:11:54,110 --> 01:11:57,690
Okay, so what if I just time skip 10 minutes right now?

1491
01:11:58,250 --> 01:11:59,130
No, he's not dead yet.

1492
01:11:59,170 --> 01:12:00,230
Look, he's still okay.

1493
01:12:00,230 --> 01:12:00,770
See?

1494
01:12:01,590 --> 01:12:02,010
Look.

1495
01:12:02,530 --> 01:12:03,550
He's right there.

1496
01:12:04,450 --> 01:12:05,850
He's having a good time.

1497
01:12:09,110 --> 01:12:10,970
He's okay, guys.

1498
01:12:11,010 --> 01:12:11,290
Look.

1499
01:12:11,950 --> 01:12:12,390
See?

1500
01:12:12,830 --> 01:12:14,670
He's just having a swimming time.

1501
01:12:15,410 --> 01:12:18,430
Look, he's floating up.

1502
01:12:18,730 --> 01:12:19,710
Look, he's floating up.

1503
01:12:19,790 --> 01:12:21,650
He wants to see what the sun is like.

1504
01:12:22,010 --> 01:12:24,910
But little does he know, he's trapped in the lab forever.

1505
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:28,830
You're never gonna see sunlight, little guy.

1506
01:12:28,830 --> 01:12:33,670
You're just gonna be part of our sick little experiments for science.

1507
01:12:34,190 --> 01:12:34,890
That's right.

1508
01:12:35,770 --> 01:12:39,130
You're never gonna see what the sun will look like.

1509
01:12:39,630 --> 01:12:41,350
This is your whole life now.

1510
01:12:41,950 --> 01:12:44,130
You live and die in this tank.

1511
01:12:49,930 --> 01:12:53,570
Just for our sick pleasure.

1512
01:12:58,830 --> 01:13:03,030
You like the artificial light to simulate sunlight for you?

1513
01:13:03,410 --> 01:13:04,790
Yeah, you like it?

1514
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:10,290
No, he's fine.

1515
01:13:10,390 --> 01:13:10,970
Look at him.

1516
01:13:11,070 --> 01:13:11,890
He's just swimming.

1517
01:13:16,820 --> 01:13:18,760
He's just swimming, guys.

1518
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:20,860
He's fine.

1519
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:22,000
Look at him.

1520
01:13:23,220 --> 01:13:24,980
He's having a great time.

1521
01:13:26,180 --> 01:13:27,700
What happened to you?

1522
01:13:27,700 --> 01:13:37,220
I literally just saw 7 of my kids die from freezing and lack of air.

1523
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:41,600
And then the 8th child got eaten by him.

1524
01:13:43,820 --> 01:13:45,900
But it all happened in my dream.

1525
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:49,220
I had like a Final Destination premonition of it.

1526
01:13:49,740 --> 01:13:52,600
You know, like the Final Destination vision that you have?

1527
01:13:52,780 --> 01:13:53,900
And all of that happened.

1528
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,720
And anyway, this is the very first time I'm playing this game.

1529
01:13:57,980 --> 01:14:00,260
This is my very first run, guys.

1530
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:01,580
Right here.

1531
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:04,420
Crazy.

1532
01:14:04,580 --> 01:14:06,120
It was a crazy dream.

1533
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:08,000
Nervous.

1534
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:09,120
Thank you for the super chat.

1535
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:09,480
Thank you.

1536
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:10,020
Thank you.

1537
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:12,380
You 100% put your sims in a portal.

1538
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:14,020
Delete the ladder.

1539
01:14:14,540 --> 01:14:16,080
Thank you for the super chat.

1540
01:14:16,220 --> 01:14:16,620
Thank you.

1541
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:17,060
Thank you.

1542
01:14:17,180 --> 01:14:18,660
Oh, I've done some...

1543
01:14:18,660 --> 01:14:19,500
Okay.

1544
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,840
I've done some fucked up shit in Sims.

1545
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:23,040
And I was like...

1546
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:23,860
I was like...

1547
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:24,940
Oh.

1548
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:26,240
Oh.

1549
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:26,660
Oh.

1550
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:27,800
Oh.

1551
01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:29,560
What's going on?

1552
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:30,020
Oh.

1553
01:14:36,750 --> 01:14:37,550
Are you okay?

1554
01:14:38,790 --> 01:14:39,650
Oh my god.

1555
01:14:40,110 --> 01:14:41,270
He's freaking out.

1556
01:14:43,830 --> 01:14:44,910
Wait, I know what to do.

1557
01:14:48,570 --> 01:14:49,530
I know what to do.

1558
01:14:50,710 --> 01:14:51,830
Guys, I know what to do.

1559
01:14:51,910 --> 01:14:52,770
I just need to pick it up.

1560
01:14:54,190 --> 01:14:54,550
Guys.

1561
01:14:55,270 --> 01:14:56,430
Guys, I know what to do.

1562
01:14:57,530 --> 01:14:57,750
Come on.

1563
01:14:57,830 --> 01:14:58,550
Come on, pick it up.

1564
01:14:58,590 --> 01:14:59,070
He's hungry.

1565
01:15:01,030 --> 01:15:01,670
Come on.

1566
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:02,430
Oh, there you go.

1567
01:15:02,970 --> 01:15:03,470
There you go.

1568
01:15:04,350 --> 01:15:05,530
I got food.

1569
01:15:06,530 --> 01:15:08,270
Guys, food will heal you.

1570
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:09,890
Oh, it's spitting out.

1571
01:15:10,550 --> 01:15:10,990
Oh, look.

1572
01:15:11,170 --> 01:15:12,810
Look, there's food right there.

1573
01:15:13,730 --> 01:15:15,150
I have food right there.

1574
01:15:15,850 --> 01:15:16,690
Don't worry.

1575
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:17,250
Are you okay?

1576
01:15:20,990 --> 01:15:22,350
Are you okay?

1577
01:15:24,650 --> 01:15:26,110
That's not vomit, right?

1578
01:15:26,190 --> 01:15:27,230
That's not blood, right?

1579
01:15:27,870 --> 01:15:30,430
Just some cranberry juice that you ingested?

1580
01:15:30,910 --> 01:15:31,690
You okay, buddy?

1581
01:15:33,030 --> 01:15:33,630
Hello?

1582
01:15:35,550 --> 01:15:36,150
Hello?

1583
01:15:37,730 --> 01:15:38,330
Hello?

1584
01:15:39,730 --> 01:15:40,890
I got food.

1585
01:15:42,890 --> 01:15:45,290
I put food in there.

1586
01:15:51,190 --> 01:15:53,050
Sharko, thank you for the super chat.

1587
01:15:53,230 --> 01:15:53,450
Thank you.

1588
01:15:53,470 --> 01:15:54,010
Thank you.

1589
01:15:54,150 --> 01:15:55,550
Wish I was that squid.

1590
01:15:58,970 --> 01:16:01,370
Someone, do we have a fish doctor?

1591
01:16:02,510 --> 01:16:04,430
He has a heart attack.

1592
01:16:04,890 --> 01:16:07,750
Any fish doctors right now in chat?

1593
01:16:08,130 --> 01:16:09,290
What do I do?

1594
01:16:10,610 --> 01:16:12,470
Why can't he just die instantly?

1595
01:16:12,710 --> 01:16:13,790
Why is he suffering?

1596
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:16,830
Why is he...

1597
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:26,520
Oh my god.

1598
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,340
No, he's still alive.

1599
01:16:29,220 --> 01:16:30,120
Holy shit.

1600
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:31,860
What the fuck is this game?

1601
01:16:31,860 --> 01:16:35,640
I just thought it was funny talking haha fish.

1602
01:16:35,860 --> 01:16:39,660
Why am I watching a squid slowly fucking die?

1603
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:42,580
This is so messed up.

1604
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:07,400
Hello?

1605
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:09,120
Hello?

1606
01:17:12,180 --> 01:17:12,720
Hello?

1607
01:17:16,710 --> 01:17:18,770
Oh my god, you can see his intestines.

1608
01:17:30,550 --> 01:17:31,790
What the...

1609
01:17:36,010 --> 01:17:39,930
What the fuck am I...

1610
01:17:40,610 --> 01:17:43,300
I'm a mother.

1611
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:48,520
Oh my god, Giles.

1612
01:17:48,700 --> 01:17:50,700
I'm a mommy now.

1613
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:51,900
I'm a mother.

1614
01:17:56,420 --> 01:17:58,100
Holy shit.

1615
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:08,240
What do I do?

1616
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:12,580
Do I...

1617
01:18:12,580 --> 01:18:13,900
Do I give him food?

1618
01:18:17,700 --> 01:18:18,800
Oh, okay.

1619
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:25,700
Like...

1620
01:18:25,940 --> 01:18:27,520
Mom, we need you.

1621
01:18:30,460 --> 01:18:32,020
Master, thank you for the super chat.

1622
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:33,000
Thank you, thank you.

1623
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:35,620
Arisa, thank you for the super chat.

1624
01:18:35,980 --> 01:18:36,180
Thank you.

1625
01:18:36,740 --> 01:18:39,020
There's no way this game was for children.

1626
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:45,480
I refuse to believe they made this game for kids.

1627
01:18:45,900 --> 01:18:47,840
There's no fucking way.

1628
01:18:49,140 --> 01:18:50,600
Okay, how do I use the mic?

1629
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:52,320
What button do I have to press to talk to them?

1630
01:18:55,930 --> 01:18:57,850
I want to talk to this one in particular.

1631
01:19:05,190 --> 01:19:07,670
This does not seem like a children's game.

1632
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:12,170
What button do I have to press on the controller?

1633
01:19:14,350 --> 01:19:16,590
Because I heard that you have to press a...

1634
01:19:16,590 --> 01:19:17,910
You have to hold a certain button.

1635
01:19:22,290 --> 01:19:24,950
He's looking at me as if like...

1636
01:19:24,950 --> 01:19:25,270
Hello?

1637
01:19:26,890 --> 01:19:27,450
Hello?

1638
01:19:28,550 --> 01:19:29,110
Hello?

1639
01:19:31,170 --> 01:19:31,730
Hello?

1640
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:35,830
Hello?

1641
01:19:38,050 --> 01:19:38,770
Hello?

1642
01:19:40,150 --> 01:19:40,770
Hello?

1643
01:19:41,530 --> 01:19:43,050
I don't know if it's working, guys.

1644
01:19:44,050 --> 01:19:44,770
Hello?

1645
01:19:47,270 --> 01:19:47,990
Hello?

1646
01:19:49,670 --> 01:19:50,950
Talk to me!

1647
01:19:51,170 --> 01:19:51,470
Hello?

1648
01:19:53,410 --> 01:19:54,130
Hello?

1649
01:19:58,910 --> 01:20:01,210
Am I allowed to talk to them yet?

1650
01:20:02,630 --> 01:20:03,350
Children!

1651
01:20:04,770 --> 01:20:05,130
Hello?

1652
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:10,530
Do babies talk?

1653
01:20:11,030 --> 01:20:11,210
Baby!

1654
01:20:12,550 --> 01:20:13,370
Baby!

1655
01:20:17,050 --> 01:20:17,870
Baby!

1656
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:19,950
That's right, baby!

1657
01:20:20,150 --> 01:20:21,390
I'm talking to you!

1658
01:20:24,090 --> 01:20:24,910
Baby!

1659
01:20:31,110 --> 01:20:33,090
How do I feed them?

1660
01:20:33,170 --> 01:20:35,310
I can't...

1661
01:20:35,310 --> 01:20:37,130
Oh my god, they're so...

1662
01:20:39,070 --> 01:20:41,550
I can't feed them anymore!

1663
01:20:42,870 --> 01:20:46,530
I already have one right here, but they don't want to eat it!

1664
01:20:47,030 --> 01:20:48,410
Eat here!

1665
01:20:49,030 --> 01:20:49,610
Eat!

1666
01:20:50,890 --> 01:20:52,350
Eat, baby!

1667
01:20:53,550 --> 01:20:54,090
Eat!

1668
01:20:54,970 --> 01:20:55,890
No, baby!

1669
01:20:56,530 --> 01:20:57,670
Eat here!

1670
01:20:58,510 --> 01:20:59,050
Eat!

1671
01:21:02,910 --> 01:21:04,650
Eat, babies!

1672
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:06,750
Eat over here!

1673
01:21:06,750 --> 01:21:07,910
Food!

1674
01:21:08,660 --> 01:21:09,130
Food!

1675
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:16,130
They're not hungry, guys.

1676
01:21:16,650 --> 01:21:17,270
They're not.

1677
01:21:19,460 --> 01:21:20,910
What do I do now?

1678
01:21:21,870 --> 01:21:26,110
What do you eat?

1679
01:21:27,850 --> 01:21:29,730
What do you fuckers eat?

1680
01:21:32,430 --> 01:21:33,170
Eat!

1681
01:21:33,630 --> 01:21:34,010
Food!

1682
01:21:34,850 --> 01:21:35,270
Food!

1683
01:21:37,370 --> 01:21:37,890
Just...

1684
01:21:39,230 --> 01:21:42,550
Okay, it's time.

1685
01:21:44,230 --> 01:21:44,750
Yes.

1686
01:21:46,310 --> 01:21:47,310
I'll come back tomorrow.

1687
01:21:47,830 --> 01:21:50,510
I'll come back in three... Okay, I'll come back in three hours.

1688
01:21:50,830 --> 01:21:54,290
Because I feel like if I come back tomorrow, the children will die.

1689
01:22:00,170 --> 01:22:04,230
I'm gonna come back... I'm gonna come back in three hours.

1690
01:22:05,090 --> 01:22:05,570
Okay.

1691
01:22:06,230 --> 01:22:07,190
Two hours.

1692
01:22:07,350 --> 01:22:09,050
I don't trust... I don't...

1693
01:22:09,050 --> 01:22:11,850
I just don't trust... I don't trust Mr. Nemo.

1694
01:22:12,590 --> 01:22:13,070
I...

1695
01:22:20,370 --> 01:22:23,010
This really is a genuine prequel.

1696
01:22:23,470 --> 01:22:24,770
Zero, thank you for the super chat.

1697
01:22:24,830 --> 01:22:25,630
Thank you, thank you.

1698
01:22:25,710 --> 01:22:27,210
Cyclone, thank you for the super chat.

1699
01:22:27,310 --> 01:22:28,170
Thank you, thank you.

1700
01:22:30,370 --> 01:22:30,850
Alright.

1701
01:22:31,330 --> 01:22:33,470
What is Mr. Nemo gonna tell me now?

1702
01:22:34,230 --> 01:22:36,330
I feel like I was being a really good parent.

1703
01:22:40,190 --> 01:22:42,330
I was being an incredibly great parent there.

1704
01:22:48,110 --> 01:22:51,550
Yeah, I saved my second visit, guys.

1705
01:23:09,930 --> 01:23:11,330
Okay.

1706
01:23:18,550 --> 01:23:21,710
I did that.

1707
01:23:36,390 --> 01:23:37,590
But please be careful.

1708
01:23:38,170 --> 01:23:42,310
Do not give them too much at once, as their appetites are insatiable.

1709
01:23:42,630 --> 01:23:44,510
So let us head over to the tank.

1710
01:23:44,690 --> 01:23:46,050
Wait, how much do I have to give them?

1711
01:23:46,330 --> 01:23:46,950
Per day?

1712
01:23:48,750 --> 01:23:51,290
Wait, how much food do I have to give them per day, then?

1713
01:23:52,790 --> 01:23:53,790
For my Gilman?

1714
01:23:55,750 --> 01:23:57,110
How much is enough?

1715
01:23:57,550 --> 01:23:58,650
Oh, wait, they ate it!

1716
01:23:58,690 --> 01:23:59,290
They ate it!

1717
01:23:59,290 --> 01:24:00,130
Look, it's gone!

1718
01:24:01,830 --> 01:24:02,630
It's gone!

1719
01:24:02,770 --> 01:24:03,730
I did my job!

1720
01:24:05,490 --> 01:24:05,930
Okay.

1721
01:24:08,110 --> 01:24:09,610
Look, it's gone!

1722
01:24:10,130 --> 01:24:10,990
Hello, my children.

1723
01:24:11,250 --> 01:24:12,070
I am here now.

1724
01:24:12,690 --> 01:24:13,130
Hello!

1725
01:24:14,270 --> 01:24:15,210
Hello, children!

1726
01:24:15,990 --> 01:24:16,370
Hello!

1727
01:24:17,050 --> 01:24:18,250
I'm here now.

1728
01:24:19,090 --> 01:24:19,850
Hello, children!

1729
01:24:21,510 --> 01:24:21,870
Hello!

1730
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:24,230
Children!

1731
01:24:26,230 --> 01:24:26,850
Hello?

1732
01:24:32,410 --> 01:24:32,850
Hello?

1733
01:24:38,220 --> 01:24:39,900
They just...

1734
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:41,060
Hello, children?

1735
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:45,940
Hello?

1736
01:24:45,940 --> 01:24:50,840
I was not with...

1737
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:52,040
They turned back!

1738
01:24:57,470 --> 01:24:57,850
Hello?

1739
01:24:58,830 --> 01:25:00,190
Children, hello?

1740
01:25:03,950 --> 01:25:05,010
Hello, children?

1741
01:25:05,710 --> 01:25:06,050
Hello?

1742
01:25:06,890 --> 01:25:07,790
Talk to me!

1743
01:25:07,890 --> 01:25:08,850
I am your mother!

1744
01:25:08,850 --> 01:25:09,850
Hello?

1745
01:25:15,950 --> 01:25:20,580
Oh my God!

1746
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:22,480
Oh my God, they said hi!

1747
01:25:23,140 --> 01:25:24,280
They said hi!

1748
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:26,180
Oh my God!

1749
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:28,800
They said their first words!

1750
01:25:30,700 --> 01:25:31,500
Hello!

1751
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:33,000
Kids!

1752
01:25:38,610 --> 01:25:40,610
They actually talked!

1753
01:25:41,030 --> 01:25:41,990
Oh my God!

1754
01:25:42,350 --> 01:25:43,190
Did you hear it?

1755
01:25:43,190 --> 01:25:44,670
He said mama!

1756
01:25:47,770 --> 01:25:50,450
They said number one mama!

1757
01:25:50,790 --> 01:25:52,610
But never killed their children.

1758
01:25:52,810 --> 01:25:54,390
Oh my God, they're so smart.

1759
01:25:54,790 --> 01:25:56,490
Already said their first sentence.

1760
01:25:57,350 --> 01:25:59,550
I know, you might not have heard it, but I heard it.

1761
01:25:59,990 --> 01:26:04,330
I've heard it, guys.

1762
01:26:04,950 --> 01:26:06,410
I heard it, though.

1763
01:26:06,830 --> 01:26:07,930
Let's give them more food.

1764
01:26:11,380 --> 01:26:11,980
Okay.

1765
01:26:12,980 --> 01:26:14,500
Here you go.

1766
01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:17,660
I got more food for you kids.

1767
01:26:18,780 --> 01:26:20,860
I got you more food.

1768
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:23,680
Look, right here.

1769
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:26,100
Right here.

1770
01:26:26,420 --> 01:26:27,000
Food!

1771
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:28,720
Food!

1772
01:26:30,020 --> 01:26:30,600
Food!

1773
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:33,080
Food!

1774
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:35,400
Eat food!

1775
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:36,980
Food!

1776
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:40,440
Food!

1777
01:26:46,910 --> 01:26:49,230
Do you want food?

1778
01:26:50,390 --> 01:26:50,970
Baby!

1779
01:26:52,050 --> 01:26:53,690
Baby want food?

1780
01:26:54,750 --> 01:26:55,950
Child!

1781
01:26:56,630 --> 01:26:57,130
Food!

1782
01:26:57,970 --> 01:26:58,350
Food!

1783
01:27:03,130 --> 01:27:05,730
Does baby want food?

1784
01:27:07,190 --> 01:27:08,010
Food!

1785
01:27:09,350 --> 01:27:10,610
Food!

1786
01:27:12,210 --> 01:27:13,450
Food!

1787
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:16,830
I'm trying!

1788
01:27:17,030 --> 01:27:18,650
I'm trying to get him to talk!

1789
01:27:19,330 --> 01:27:19,630
Food!

1790
01:27:21,530 --> 01:27:22,230
Food!

1791
01:27:23,690 --> 01:27:24,350
Food!

1792
01:27:25,310 --> 01:27:26,010
Food!

1793
01:27:27,650 --> 01:27:28,350
Food!

1794
01:27:30,810 --> 01:27:31,510
Food!

1795
01:27:31,650 --> 01:27:32,290
Oh, you don't like that.

1796
01:27:32,770 --> 01:27:34,050
You don't like that, do you?

1797
01:27:34,650 --> 01:27:35,270
You don't...

1798
01:27:35,270 --> 01:27:37,130
Bro is not listening.

1799
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:46,000
Okay, okay.

1800
01:27:46,380 --> 01:27:48,100
Okay, he doesn't like food.

1801
01:27:51,620 --> 01:27:53,400
Alright, I'm coming back.

1802
01:27:53,540 --> 01:27:56,120
How long does it take for them to grow, guys?

1803
01:27:56,760 --> 01:27:59,000
How long does it take for these guys to grow?

1804
01:28:00,140 --> 01:28:01,460
Guys, how long?

1805
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:03,100
Oh my god, what the fuck?

1806
01:28:05,180 --> 01:28:07,020
How long does it take for them to grow?

1807
01:28:08,820 --> 01:28:09,920
One day at a time?

1808
01:28:10,020 --> 01:28:11,500
I'm coming back tomorrow!

1809
01:28:12,380 --> 01:28:12,940
Tomorrow!

1810
01:28:14,460 --> 01:28:15,580
Alright, Gilman?

1811
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:17,200
Tomorrow!

1812
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:19,040
I come back!

1813
01:28:19,820 --> 01:28:20,340
Tomorrow!

1814
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:25,480
Okay, okay.

1815
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:26,900
I think they understand.

1816
01:28:27,580 --> 01:28:28,620
Next day!

1817
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,040
I'll be back.

1818
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:33,400
Don't worry, children.

1819
01:28:33,620 --> 01:28:38,780
Okay, let me make sure that everything is okay right now.

1820
01:28:40,580 --> 01:28:43,340
Peter, let's put that at 19 for now.

1821
01:28:47,260 --> 01:28:48,400
Yeah, I'm putting that there.

1822
01:28:48,460 --> 01:28:49,500
Alright, I'm coming back tomorrow!

1823
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:49,860
Tomorrow!

1824
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:53,760
Is it even working?

1825
01:28:54,260 --> 01:28:55,400
It's gotta work!

1826
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:56,140
It's working!

1827
01:28:56,380 --> 01:28:57,080
It is!

1828
01:28:57,380 --> 01:28:58,900
I believe in it!

1829
01:29:00,720 --> 01:29:01,400
Okay.

1830
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:03,080
Okay, then we...

1831
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:05,220
We come back the next day.

1832
01:29:07,240 --> 01:29:07,580
Okay.

1833
01:29:08,120 --> 01:29:09,500
It should work.

1834
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:12,500
It says it works.

1835
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:15,520
I wonder what...

1836
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:17,280
Okay, it should be like stereo.

1837
01:29:17,340 --> 01:29:17,580
Okay.

1838
01:29:17,580 --> 01:29:19,360
Okay, tomorrow.

1839
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:23,520
I'm gonna put that at 8am.

1840
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:26,900
The next day.

1841
01:29:29,420 --> 01:29:29,860
Okay.

1842
01:29:30,640 --> 01:29:31,480
It'll be okay.

1843
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:33,420
It's technically tomorrow.

1844
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:36,280
My little seaman.

1845
01:29:43,690 --> 01:29:44,570
Alright.

1846
01:29:51,090 --> 01:29:53,670
A little time travel wouldn't hurt anybody.

1847
01:29:53,670 --> 01:29:54,070
Good

1848
01:29:57,550 --> 01:30:00,150
morning.

1849
01:30:01,090 --> 01:30:03,650
Welcome to the laboratory of Jean-Paul Gasset.

1850
01:30:05,490 --> 01:30:07,410
Greetings, and welcome back.

1851
01:30:07,970 --> 01:30:09,370
You're doing a good job.

1852
01:30:11,750 --> 01:30:12,530
Let's see.

1853
01:30:12,930 --> 01:30:15,090
Did you hear the noises that young man was making?

1854
01:30:15,510 --> 01:30:15,690
Yeah!

1855
01:30:16,070 --> 01:30:17,910
It seems as if he's trying to speak.

1856
01:30:18,830 --> 01:30:21,570
You can use your microphone to speak to him as well.

1857
01:30:22,670 --> 01:30:26,090
Do not forget to press the A button while you're speaking into the microphone.

1858
01:30:26,090 --> 01:30:26,830
Okay, it's A.

1859
01:30:41,530 --> 01:30:42,450
Oh no!

1860
01:30:46,270 --> 01:30:47,290
Oh my god, wait!

1861
01:30:47,430 --> 01:30:48,590
I didn't raise the heater!

1862
01:30:49,130 --> 01:30:49,710
Don't worry!

1863
01:30:49,810 --> 01:30:50,030
Kids!

1864
01:30:52,930 --> 01:30:53,770
Oh, oh.

1865
01:30:54,190 --> 01:30:54,690
Don't worry.

1866
01:30:57,810 --> 01:30:58,690
We're...

1867
01:30:58,690 --> 01:31:00,410
Okay, don't worry kids.

1868
01:31:01,350 --> 01:31:03,050
Don't worry kids.

1869
01:31:04,870 --> 01:31:05,670
I got you!

1870
01:31:06,830 --> 01:31:08,570
Kids, I got you!

1871
01:31:10,190 --> 01:31:11,930
I'm raising the heat!

1872
01:31:15,690 --> 01:31:17,010
Wake up!

1873
01:31:19,530 --> 01:31:21,290
It's so warm now!

1874
01:31:23,450 --> 01:31:23,970
Okay.

1875
01:31:26,550 --> 01:31:27,710
That should be good.

1876
01:31:27,850 --> 01:31:28,850
And then the air.

1877
01:31:32,270 --> 01:31:34,150
Okay, and then you guys can breathe.

1878
01:31:34,530 --> 01:31:35,770
Breathe, my children!

1879
01:31:38,510 --> 01:31:39,030
Breathe!

1880
01:31:41,890 --> 01:31:43,630
It's okay, it's just a little hot.

1881
01:31:44,050 --> 01:31:45,270
It's just a little bit.

1882
01:31:45,410 --> 01:31:46,010
It's okay.

1883
01:31:47,670 --> 01:31:49,670
It's just a little bit hot, guys.

1884
01:31:49,710 --> 01:31:50,330
It's okay.

1885
01:31:54,390 --> 01:31:54,830
Alright.

1886
01:31:55,230 --> 01:31:56,690
And now they can breathe too.

1887
01:31:58,010 --> 01:31:58,450
Okay.

1888
01:32:00,750 --> 01:32:01,630
And then...

1889
01:32:02,150 --> 01:32:02,810
It's okay.

1890
01:32:03,010 --> 01:32:03,750
It'll go down.

1891
01:32:03,830 --> 01:32:05,070
It's gonna go down anyway.

1892
01:32:05,590 --> 01:32:07,290
Okay, and then we give you food.

1893
01:32:08,050 --> 01:32:09,050
Take the food, children!

1894
01:32:11,950 --> 01:32:12,790
Where's the food?

1895
01:32:14,330 --> 01:32:15,670
Oh wait, where did the food go?

1896
01:32:15,670 --> 01:32:16,230
Okay, there you go.

1897
01:32:16,650 --> 01:32:17,590
Take the food, children!

1898
01:32:19,770 --> 01:32:20,210
What?

1899
01:32:20,210 --> 01:32:20,370
What?

1900
01:32:21,710 --> 01:32:22,170
What?

1901
01:32:23,470 --> 01:32:24,750
Why ain't no grab?

1902
01:32:25,550 --> 01:32:26,410
Oh, there you go.

1903
01:32:27,730 --> 01:32:28,630
There you go.

1904
01:32:28,870 --> 01:32:29,930
Eat, my children!

1905
01:32:30,370 --> 01:32:30,930
Eat!

1906
01:32:31,950 --> 01:32:32,230
Eat!

1907
01:32:34,090 --> 01:32:34,650
Eat!

1908
01:32:35,970 --> 01:32:37,570
Eat the food!

1909
01:32:38,730 --> 01:32:39,290
Eat!

1910
01:32:40,930 --> 01:32:41,970
Keep eating!

1911
01:32:42,950 --> 01:32:43,870
Did they eat it?

1912
01:32:44,030 --> 01:32:44,750
I can't tell.

1913
01:32:45,970 --> 01:32:46,830
Did they eat the food?

1914
01:32:46,910 --> 01:32:47,490
Oh, it's gone.

1915
01:32:48,110 --> 01:32:49,730
Did all of them eat though?

1916
01:32:49,890 --> 01:32:51,230
Did you all eat the food?

1917
01:32:51,330 --> 01:32:52,950
Okay, I need to figure out if the microphone's not...

1918
01:32:52,950 --> 01:32:53,650
I don't think the microphone...

1919
01:32:55,890 --> 01:32:59,490
I don't know if the microphone is actually working.

1920
01:33:01,590 --> 01:33:03,270
Do I give them another one?

1921
01:33:04,070 --> 01:33:05,970
I'll give them another one just in case.

1922
01:33:06,850 --> 01:33:07,230
Okay.

1923
01:33:09,030 --> 01:33:09,830
Here you go.

1924
01:33:11,050 --> 01:33:11,850
Here you go.

1925
01:33:12,710 --> 01:33:15,350
Here's another food for the ones that couldn't.

1926
01:33:17,610 --> 01:33:20,070
No, it's okay, it's just one guide.

1927
01:33:20,530 --> 01:33:21,550
Look, see, none of them are eating.

1928
01:33:22,150 --> 01:33:23,430
None of them are eating it too.

1929
01:33:24,290 --> 01:33:24,530
Hello!

1930
01:33:25,810 --> 01:33:26,390
Hello!

1931
01:33:28,010 --> 01:33:28,590
Hello!

1932
01:33:31,170 --> 01:33:31,750
Hello!

1933
01:33:32,990 --> 01:33:33,350
Hello!

1934
01:33:35,250 --> 01:33:35,630
Hello!

1935
01:33:38,150 --> 01:33:40,170
Guys, I don't think it's working.

1936
01:33:40,690 --> 01:33:41,030
Hello!

1937
01:33:44,050 --> 01:33:44,630
Wait!

1938
01:33:44,630 --> 01:33:44,790
Wait!

1939
01:33:46,510 --> 01:33:47,690
Mr. Nimoy!

1940
01:33:49,150 --> 01:33:49,690
Hello!

1941
01:33:51,090 --> 01:33:51,610
Hello!

1942
01:33:53,270 --> 01:33:54,250
Wait, he's looking!

1943
01:33:54,370 --> 01:33:54,730
He's looking!

1944
01:33:54,770 --> 01:33:55,590
Is he looking at me?

1945
01:33:57,970 --> 01:33:59,070
I'm holding A.

1946
01:34:00,210 --> 01:34:01,570
Is he looking at me?

1947
01:34:02,150 --> 01:34:02,450
Hello?

1948
01:34:03,990 --> 01:34:05,110
Are you stupid?

1949
01:34:14,630 --> 01:34:15,650
He's like, no!

1950
01:34:16,910 --> 01:34:17,410
No!

1951
01:34:17,910 --> 01:34:19,910
He looks so confused.

1952
01:34:20,410 --> 01:34:22,250
The fuck you say?

1953
01:34:22,650 --> 01:34:23,850
Wait, what if I talk to him?

1954
01:34:24,350 --> 01:34:24,630
Hello!

1955
01:34:25,950 --> 01:34:26,670
Oh, wait!

1956
01:34:26,870 --> 01:34:27,970
They're acknowledging me!

1957
01:34:28,350 --> 01:34:28,590
Hello!

1958
01:34:29,770 --> 01:34:31,010
Hello, look at me!

1959
01:34:31,310 --> 01:34:32,390
Look at me, I am your mother!

1960
01:34:33,330 --> 01:34:33,990
Look at me!

1961
01:34:34,190 --> 01:34:34,890
I am your mother!

1962
01:34:45,010 --> 01:34:46,350
Show me your face!

1963
01:34:46,930 --> 01:34:47,730
You stupid son!

1964
01:34:48,450 --> 01:34:49,210
Look at me!

1965
01:34:51,690 --> 01:34:52,550
Look at me!

1966
01:34:52,970 --> 01:34:54,970
You haven't hit your puberty stage yet!

1967
01:34:55,050 --> 01:34:56,410
I need you to look at me!

1968
01:34:57,210 --> 01:34:58,070
Look at me!

1969
01:35:01,070 --> 01:35:02,150
You're not stupid!

1970
01:35:02,310 --> 01:35:02,950
I was joking!

1971
01:35:03,250 --> 01:35:04,430
Please, look at me!

1972
01:35:06,230 --> 01:35:07,130
There's eight of you!

1973
01:35:07,230 --> 01:35:09,270
You know I need to pick one in the end.

1974
01:35:09,410 --> 01:35:10,550
There has to be a favorite child.

1975
01:35:10,650 --> 01:35:11,210
There's eight of you.

1976
01:35:11,290 --> 01:35:12,650
Don't you want to be the favorite child?

1977
01:35:13,390 --> 01:35:16,130
Don't you want to be a favorite child, little guy?

1978
01:35:16,530 --> 01:35:16,770
Hello!

1979
01:35:17,670 --> 01:35:18,230
Hello!

1980
01:35:19,270 --> 01:35:19,630
Hello!

1981
01:35:26,870 --> 01:35:27,430
Okay,

1982
01:35:31,110 --> 01:35:31,430
wait.

1983
01:35:32,910 --> 01:35:35,470
I don't know if the microphone is actually working, guys.

1984
01:35:35,570 --> 01:35:36,290
I can't tell.

1985
01:35:36,670 --> 01:35:38,630
I actually cannot tell.

1986
01:35:38,630 --> 01:35:43,970
I'm holding A, but I can't tell if the microphone is actually working.

1987
01:35:44,150 --> 01:35:46,370
I can't tell at all.

1988
01:35:49,430 --> 01:35:49,930
Alright.

1989
01:35:50,290 --> 01:35:57,070
I'll give it a couple of hours, because I feel like they'll freeze if I use, like...

1990
01:35:57,690 --> 01:35:58,490
Like, what?

1991
01:35:59,290 --> 01:36:00,730
I guess, like...

1992
01:36:00,730 --> 01:36:01,370
Wait, baby!

1993
01:36:02,010 --> 01:36:02,530
Okay, wait.

1994
01:36:02,570 --> 01:36:03,090
Let me invite her.

1995
01:36:03,510 --> 01:36:03,890
Baby!

1996
01:36:04,730 --> 01:36:05,230
Baby!

1997
01:36:06,310 --> 01:36:06,710
Baby!

1998
01:36:06,710 --> 01:36:07,010
Baby!

1999
01:36:07,570 --> 01:36:08,150
Hello!

2000
01:36:09,170 --> 01:36:10,190
Hello, baby!

2001
01:36:11,330 --> 01:36:11,990
Hello!

2002
01:36:12,770 --> 01:36:13,330
Baby!

2003
01:36:14,010 --> 01:36:14,370
Baby!

2004
01:36:14,650 --> 01:36:15,290
Look at me!

2005
01:36:15,870 --> 01:36:16,250
Baby!

2006
01:36:17,250 --> 01:36:18,150
Hello!

2007
01:36:21,710 --> 01:36:23,970
They stopped talking to me!

2008
01:36:27,470 --> 01:36:28,630
Baby fish!

2009
01:36:29,630 --> 01:36:29,950
Hello!

2010
01:36:31,790 --> 01:36:32,550
Baby!

2011
01:36:36,710 --> 01:36:38,850
They stopped talking!

2012
01:36:39,070 --> 01:36:43,870
They used to talk to me, and then they stopped talking to me, guys!

2013
01:36:44,210 --> 01:36:45,710
What happened?!

2014
01:36:48,470 --> 01:36:51,750
Why don't they talk to me no more?!

2015
01:36:52,510 --> 01:36:54,450
I don't understand!

2016
01:36:56,510 --> 01:36:57,830
They hate me.

2017
01:36:58,190 --> 01:36:59,710
What did I do?!

2018
01:37:00,690 --> 01:37:04,750
I've been nothing but kind to my children!

2019
01:37:04,750 --> 01:37:07,090
I don't understand!

2020
01:37:08,030 --> 01:37:11,150
I've been so nice to my kids!

2021
01:37:12,050 --> 01:37:13,290
Why are they...

2022
01:37:13,270 --> 01:37:16,250
Why are they so stupid?!

2023
01:37:16,250 --> 01:37:23,370
I don't understand!

2024
01:37:23,750 --> 01:37:23,990
Hello!

2025
01:37:25,170 --> 01:37:25,770
Hello!

2026
01:37:27,230 --> 01:37:27,590
Hello!

2027
01:37:29,510 --> 01:37:30,310
Hello!

2028
01:37:31,930 --> 01:37:32,470
Hello!

2029
01:37:33,350 --> 01:37:35,230
They used to respond to me!

2030
01:37:36,730 --> 01:37:38,010
Respond to me!

2031
01:37:41,930 --> 01:37:44,310
Why don't you talk to me?!

2032
01:37:44,910 --> 01:37:46,230
Look at me!

2033
01:37:48,770 --> 01:37:51,190
They know what they did to you.

2034
01:37:51,250 --> 01:37:53,410
They know what you did to your brothers.

2035
01:37:55,610 --> 01:37:56,850
No, it works!

2036
01:37:57,310 --> 01:37:58,850
It should work!

2037
01:37:58,990 --> 01:38:00,030
Okay, alright.

2038
01:38:00,250 --> 01:38:01,910
We wait a couple of hours.

2039
01:38:02,550 --> 01:38:03,550
I'll be back, children.

2040
01:38:04,390 --> 01:38:05,150
I'll be back.

2041
01:38:05,150 --> 01:38:05,750
Don't worry.

2042
01:38:05,850 --> 01:38:06,050
Okay.

2043
01:38:06,250 --> 01:38:08,170
Wait, let me fix... make sure the air is up.

2044
01:38:08,710 --> 01:38:10,150
Make sure the air and the...

2045
01:38:11,150 --> 01:38:12,910
I need to make sure they don't die.

2046
01:38:13,830 --> 01:38:15,290
The most important part.

2047
01:38:18,290 --> 01:38:20,310
I gotta make sure they don't die.

2048
01:38:23,490 --> 01:38:25,970
Okay, I'll be back in a couple of hours, children.

2049
01:38:28,550 --> 01:38:29,410
Don't worry.

2050
01:38:29,750 --> 01:38:31,590
I'll be back, little ones.

2051
01:38:31,990 --> 01:38:34,770
I'll be back until you grow big and strong.

2052
01:38:36,570 --> 01:38:38,010
Do not worry.

2053
01:38:39,570 --> 01:38:40,090
Okay.

2054
01:38:45,500 --> 01:38:47,000
I'll give a couple of hours.

2055
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:48,160
I don't trust...

2056
01:38:48,160 --> 01:38:50,500
I don't trust, like, the next day.

2057
01:38:50,680 --> 01:38:52,760
Because I literally put a couple of hours.

2058
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:56,420
And then, Mr. Nimoy was like, Your fish is dying.

2059
01:38:56,540 --> 01:38:56,700
Whoops.

2060
01:38:57,700 --> 01:38:59,920
He was like, Your fish is freezing.

2061
01:39:00,120 --> 01:39:00,940
And I'm like, what?

2062
01:39:01,980 --> 01:39:03,580
What do you mean they're freezing?

2063
01:39:04,340 --> 01:39:05,380
How are they...

2064
01:39:05,380 --> 01:39:07,300
How are they freezing?

2065
01:39:08,420 --> 01:39:10,920
I left for, like, a couple of hours.

2066
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:12,840
Okay.

2067
01:39:16,900 --> 01:39:18,260
That should be fine.

2068
01:39:20,160 --> 01:39:21,560
They should still be alive.

2069
01:39:25,230 --> 01:39:27,270
They should still be alive, right?

2070
01:39:30,210 --> 01:39:31,830
I'm back now, kids.

2071
01:39:32,530 --> 01:39:33,690
I'm back.

2072
01:39:35,030 --> 01:39:39,250
I've been with them for at least five minutes every time.

2073
01:39:39,770 --> 01:39:41,010
Every couple... Every day.

2074
01:39:41,730 --> 01:39:43,790
That's enough love for these fishes.

2075
01:39:45,730 --> 01:39:47,290
Okay, they should be alive.

2076
01:39:48,230 --> 01:39:49,190
Hello, Mr. Nimoy.

2077
01:39:49,290 --> 01:39:50,190
Are they alive?

2078
01:39:50,530 --> 01:39:51,730
Are my children alive?

2079
01:39:54,250 --> 01:39:54,930
Yeah.

2080
01:40:12,270 --> 01:40:12,790
Okay.

2081
01:40:12,870 --> 01:40:13,870
Okay, they're still alive.

2082
01:40:16,130 --> 01:40:16,450
See?

2083
01:40:16,550 --> 01:40:17,190
Look, they're like...

2084
01:40:17,190 --> 01:40:18,610
You don't have to keep coming back.

2085
01:40:19,150 --> 01:40:21,310
But they're always suffering from the cold.

2086
01:40:23,290 --> 01:40:24,810
They're always cold.

2087
01:40:26,290 --> 01:40:28,050
They're like, stop giving them attention.

2088
01:40:28,270 --> 01:40:30,570
Then stop fucking making it so cold.

2089
01:40:30,570 --> 01:40:34,910
They always have to be there to fucking raise the temperature for these fuckers.

2090
01:40:35,420 --> 01:40:37,730
I mean, the children that I love.

2091
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:40,830
Okay.

2092
01:40:41,790 --> 01:40:46,950
Children that I love and raise to their full potential.

2093
01:40:48,210 --> 01:40:49,790
Don't worry, kids.

2094
01:40:52,790 --> 01:40:54,030
That's okay.

2095
01:40:55,090 --> 01:40:57,910
Are you guys happier now, my kids?

2096
01:40:58,890 --> 01:40:59,630
Kids.

2097
01:41:01,210 --> 01:41:05,970
Don't worry, it's at 19.4.

2098
01:41:07,330 --> 01:41:10,190
Why are you- Oh, one degree is higher.

2099
01:41:10,570 --> 01:41:12,190
Oh my- Grow up, kids.

2100
01:41:12,790 --> 01:41:14,770
Grow the fuck up right now.

2101
01:41:18,190 --> 01:41:19,350
Alright, there you go.

2102
01:41:21,070 --> 01:41:22,290
How are you guys crying?

2103
01:41:22,490 --> 01:41:25,010
It was literally 0.1 degree higher.

2104
01:41:25,770 --> 01:41:26,290
Children.

2105
01:41:27,610 --> 01:41:29,910
Why are you guys being little bitches right now?

2106
01:41:29,910 --> 01:41:31,770
I did not raise little bitches.

2107
01:41:32,950 --> 01:41:38,970
Don't keep their poor- Alright, nice.

2108
01:41:39,090 --> 01:41:39,290
Alright.

2109
01:41:40,770 --> 01:41:42,370
Hello, little one.

2110
01:41:42,750 --> 01:41:43,170
Hello.

2111
01:41:44,390 --> 01:41:44,890
Hello.

2112
01:41:45,730 --> 01:41:48,870
Okay, let me check the microphone thing real quick.

2113
01:41:51,730 --> 01:41:52,490
Sound.

2114
01:41:53,430 --> 01:41:54,630
Okay, no, not that.

2115
01:41:58,870 --> 01:41:59,390
Okay.

2116
01:41:59,390 --> 01:42:00,150
Let me double check.

2117
01:42:00,250 --> 01:42:01,310
Which one would it be at?

2118
01:42:01,810 --> 01:42:02,610
Is it video?

2119
01:42:03,850 --> 01:42:04,670
I don't remember.

2120
01:42:04,850 --> 01:42:05,730
Oh, it's control.

2121
01:42:06,990 --> 01:42:07,310
Right?

2122
01:42:07,710 --> 01:42:08,090
No.

2123
01:42:08,530 --> 01:42:09,770
Which one is it?

2124
01:42:10,510 --> 01:42:11,750
Which one would it be?

2125
01:42:12,730 --> 01:42:13,050
Okay.

2126
01:42:14,510 --> 01:42:17,410
No, I did buy an A.

2127
01:42:18,070 --> 01:42:18,850
No, I did.

2128
01:42:20,170 --> 01:42:21,390
Okay, give me a sec.

2129
01:42:21,470 --> 01:42:23,630
I'm trying to remember how to do this.

2130
01:42:26,470 --> 01:42:29,630
Oh no, yeah, it is on microphone.

2131
01:42:30,710 --> 01:42:31,790
Okay.

2132
01:42:33,190 --> 01:42:35,470
Yeah, it is.

2133
01:42:35,550 --> 01:42:36,950
I have it on microphone.

2134
01:42:39,290 --> 01:42:39,990
Controller.

2135
01:42:42,010 --> 01:42:42,570
A.

2136
01:42:44,770 --> 01:42:46,170
Yeah!

2137
01:42:47,430 --> 01:42:48,130
Okay.

2138
01:42:49,590 --> 01:42:49,950
Hello.

2139
01:42:51,330 --> 01:42:52,290
Hello.

2140
01:42:53,510 --> 01:42:54,490
Hello?

2141
01:42:54,490 --> 01:42:55,310
Hello?

2142
01:42:57,030 --> 01:42:58,170
Hello?

2143
01:43:00,250 --> 01:43:00,850
Hello?

2144
01:43:03,350 --> 01:43:05,270
Don't ignore me.

2145
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:06,810
Baby!

2146
01:43:09,110 --> 01:43:10,250
Baby!

2147
01:43:12,610 --> 01:43:13,210
Baby!

2148
01:43:17,940 --> 01:43:19,750
Give me a sec, I need to use the bathroom.

2149
01:43:24,490 --> 01:43:25,210
I need to use the bathroom.

2150
01:43:25,310 --> 01:43:26,770
These kids are...

2151
01:43:27,310 --> 01:43:28,370
These children.

2152
01:44:25,190 --> 01:44:27,750
Why don't these children talk to me?

2153
01:44:28,230 --> 01:44:29,890
I do so much!

2154
01:44:31,390 --> 01:44:31,870
Microphone.

2155
01:44:32,910 --> 01:44:38,030
I don't understand!

2156
01:44:39,310 --> 01:44:42,650
I do so much for them!

2157
01:44:46,060 --> 01:44:47,500
I don't understand.

2158
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:52,940
I do so much.

2159
01:44:53,700 --> 01:44:55,380
Oh my god!

2160
01:44:55,780 --> 01:44:57,280
Okay, I have to run as admin.

2161
01:44:57,380 --> 01:44:58,860
Okay, I'll be back.

2162
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:00,080
Wait, let me feed you guys.

2163
01:45:01,040 --> 01:45:02,900
I mean, run as admin on my Dreamcast.

2164
01:45:03,120 --> 01:45:04,200
For, so that...

2165
01:45:04,200 --> 01:45:05,080
I mean, my screen...

2166
01:45:05,080 --> 01:45:06,400
My capture device.

2167
01:45:07,020 --> 01:45:09,940
Yeah, that's what...

2168
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:15,640
I have to run it on my capture device, guys.

2169
01:45:16,720 --> 01:45:17,440
There we go.

2170
01:45:24,920 --> 01:45:25,740
Wow.

2171
01:45:25,740 --> 01:45:27,520
What do you mean?

2172
01:45:27,780 --> 01:45:29,440
I literally fed them!

2173
01:45:30,170 --> 01:45:32,580
How much more do these fuckers need?

2174
01:45:34,170 --> 01:45:37,440
I like, gave them food and love.

2175
01:45:37,960 --> 01:45:39,820
By screaming at them.

2176
01:45:40,680 --> 01:45:41,280
Alright.

2177
01:45:42,580 --> 01:45:43,400
Okay.

2178
01:45:43,960 --> 01:45:44,680
Alright.

2179
01:45:45,180 --> 01:45:46,280
Don't worry, little ones.

2180
01:45:46,280 --> 01:45:48,300
I shall communicate with you.

2181
01:45:48,420 --> 01:45:55,520
I will communicate with you kids.

2182
01:45:55,740 --> 01:45:57,880
If it's the last thing I do.

2183
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:03,720
Do not worry.

2184
01:46:04,540 --> 01:46:05,180
Child.

2185
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:07,200
You shall be communicated.

2186
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:10,660
I will do my best.

2187
01:46:11,440 --> 01:46:14,520
I need to be able to tell my kids.

2188
01:46:15,300 --> 01:46:17,000
What I want them to do.

2189
01:46:17,400 --> 01:46:19,160
I should be allowed to.

2190
01:46:22,920 --> 01:46:26,140
How else would the kids know any better, guys?

2191
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:29,400
How else would they know any better if I can't talk to them?

2192
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:38,560
The time setting of the Dreamcast internal clock does not match the time setting of your Seaman Habitat file.

2193
01:46:39,080 --> 01:46:43,300
The time setting of the Dreamcast internal clock may be incorrect.

2194
01:46:44,140 --> 01:46:45,920
Please adjust it if necessary.

2195
01:46:50,780 --> 01:46:53,860
Guys, what was it?

2196
01:46:54,440 --> 01:46:58,960
Guys, what was it?

2197
01:46:58,960 --> 01:46:59,840
Do you remember what it was?

2198
01:47:03,140 --> 01:47:05,820
Does anyone remember what it was?

2199
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:08,740
I don't remember what I put it on.

2200
01:47:13,500 --> 01:47:14,780
It was...

2201
01:47:17,540 --> 01:47:19,080
What was it?

2202
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:20,860
Guys, what was it?

2203
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:21,560
I don't remember.

2204
01:47:22,900 --> 01:47:24,100
What was it for?

2205
01:47:24,460 --> 01:47:24,760
Okay.

2206
01:47:25,400 --> 01:47:25,720
Time.

2207
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:26,540
What was the time?

2208
01:47:27,680 --> 01:47:28,500
Guys.

2209
01:47:30,080 --> 01:47:32,620
Surely somebody remembers the time.

2210
01:47:33,140 --> 01:47:33,560
Surely.

2211
01:47:34,780 --> 01:47:35,610
It was...

2212
01:47:36,180 --> 01:47:37,360
I don't remember.

2213
01:47:39,180 --> 01:47:40,820
He knows.

2214
01:47:41,340 --> 01:47:42,820
Mr. Nimoy knows.

2215
01:47:44,180 --> 01:47:44,900
Okay, you're right.

2216
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:45,380
The file.

2217
01:47:47,120 --> 01:47:48,180
You're right.

2218
01:47:49,880 --> 01:47:50,600
4...

2219
01:47:50,600 --> 01:47:51,900
Okay, we were all wrong.

2220
01:47:52,300 --> 01:47:55,400
It was 4.05.16.43.

2221
01:47:55,400 --> 01:47:56,000
Okay.

2222
01:47:56,500 --> 01:47:57,320
4.05.

2223
01:47:58,520 --> 01:47:58,820
Okay.

2224
01:47:59,580 --> 01:48:03,760
4.05.16.

2225
01:48:04,820 --> 01:48:06,860
Okay, it's like I traveled an hour.

2226
01:48:07,460 --> 01:48:09,940
I traveled a couple of hours.

2227
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:10,480
There we go.

2228
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:11,400
Save.

2229
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:12,580
Guys, we saved it.

2230
01:48:13,060 --> 01:48:15,240
We saved it.

2231
01:48:15,620 --> 01:48:16,820
He'll never know.

2232
01:48:17,780 --> 01:48:19,540
He'll never know, guys.

2233
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:21,620
He'll never know.

2234
01:48:23,260 --> 01:48:24,580
He didn't caught me.

2235
01:48:29,820 --> 01:48:31,600
He didn't catch me, guys.

2236
01:48:34,660 --> 01:48:36,060
Oh, I forgot the...

2237
01:48:36,060 --> 01:48:37,400
Guys, I forgot the year.

2238
01:48:37,720 --> 01:48:38,920
I forgot to do the...

2239
01:48:41,100 --> 01:48:43,220
Oh, shit.

2240
01:48:43,620 --> 01:48:43,860
Okay.

2241
01:48:44,340 --> 01:48:45,040
Guys, guys.

2242
01:48:45,280 --> 01:48:46,820
He still has yet to catch me.

2243
01:48:47,460 --> 01:48:49,080
He hasn't caught me yet.

2244
01:48:49,620 --> 01:48:50,400
Okay, there we go.

2245
01:48:51,160 --> 01:48:52,120
Hasn't caught me.

2246
01:48:52,500 --> 01:48:53,420
No, no, no.

2247
01:48:53,460 --> 01:48:54,760
Still hasn't caught me.

2248
01:48:55,560 --> 01:48:56,200
There we go.

2249
01:48:58,360 --> 01:48:59,400
Never caught...

2250
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:03,340
It's okay.

2251
01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:04,160
He doesn't know.

2252
01:49:04,760 --> 01:49:06,080
Mr. Nimoy doesn't know.

2253
01:49:08,980 --> 01:49:10,240
Hello, Mr. Nimoy.

2254
01:49:10,300 --> 01:49:10,860
I'm back.

2255
01:49:14,100 --> 01:49:16,240
Time Cop hasn't caught me yet.

2256
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:17,140
I'm still there.

2257
01:49:23,060 --> 01:49:23,580
Okay.

2258
01:49:24,440 --> 01:49:25,020
Am I in the clear?

2259
01:49:30,700 --> 01:49:32,720
This is your fourth visit today.

2260
01:49:33,340 --> 01:49:34,560
You visit often.

2261
01:49:35,620 --> 01:49:38,640
If one didn't know better, one might assume you're quite obsessed.

2262
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:41,500
Or you have nothing better to do.

2263
01:49:41,900 --> 01:49:42,540
Is that true?

2264
01:49:43,320 --> 01:49:44,240
At the moment...

2265
01:49:44,240 --> 01:49:46,040
I'm just trying to make sure they don't die.

2266
01:49:46,660 --> 01:49:47,260
You men...

2267
01:49:48,360 --> 01:49:50,700
They are enjoying a comfortable environment.

2268
01:49:51,120 --> 01:49:51,340
Oh, see.

2269
01:49:51,380 --> 01:49:52,140
It's very comfortable.

2270
01:49:52,440 --> 01:49:53,600
So, let us head over to the tent.

2271
01:49:53,720 --> 01:49:53,800
Yeah.

2272
01:49:56,020 --> 01:49:58,500
He's saying it's very comfortable, guys.

2273
01:49:59,460 --> 01:50:01,260
They enjoy it.

2274
01:50:02,500 --> 01:50:04,320
They enjoy their time.

2275
01:50:04,520 --> 01:50:06,000
Okay, let's check the...

2276
01:50:06,180 --> 01:50:07,800
Check the usual...

2277
01:50:08,160 --> 01:50:09,300
Okay, 100.

2278
01:50:09,600 --> 01:50:09,940
Okay.

2279
01:50:11,300 --> 01:50:12,020
Hello!

2280
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:15,400
Hello!

2281
01:50:16,680 --> 01:50:17,200
Hello!

2282
01:50:18,180 --> 01:50:18,840
Baby!

2283
01:50:20,280 --> 01:50:20,820
Baby!

2284
01:50:21,720 --> 01:50:22,200
Yes!

2285
01:50:22,460 --> 01:50:22,720
Hello!

2286
01:50:23,900 --> 01:50:24,980
Do you see me?

2287
01:50:26,120 --> 01:50:27,200
Hello!

2288
01:50:31,460 --> 01:50:32,100
Hello!

2289
01:50:34,900 --> 01:50:35,540
Speak!

2290
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:37,500
Speak to me, child!

2291
01:50:38,360 --> 01:50:39,000
Speak!

2292
01:50:40,020 --> 01:50:40,660
Please!

2293
01:50:40,740 --> 01:50:41,900
Speak to me!

2294
01:50:43,520 --> 01:50:44,740
Oh my god.

2295
01:50:44,780 --> 01:50:45,880
Okay, we give them food.

2296
01:50:50,240 --> 01:50:53,440
Maybe if I give them food, they'll speak to me.

2297
01:50:54,300 --> 01:50:54,680
You know?

2298
01:50:59,170 --> 01:51:00,370
Will they speak now?

2299
01:51:00,830 --> 01:51:01,170
Hello!

2300
01:51:01,170 --> 01:51:02,170
Hello!

2301
01:51:03,790 --> 01:51:04,370
Children!

2302
01:51:07,930 --> 01:51:08,470
Children!

2303
01:51:10,190 --> 01:51:10,990
Children!

2304
01:51:12,590 --> 01:51:13,350
Children!

2305
01:51:15,670 --> 01:51:18,190
Is feeding them three times not good?

2306
01:51:18,990 --> 01:51:20,010
They're not...

2307
01:51:20,010 --> 01:51:21,270
They're not fat.

2308
01:51:22,090 --> 01:51:23,790
Perfectly good weight.

2309
01:51:24,310 --> 01:51:24,670
Children!

2310
01:51:24,930 --> 01:51:25,150
Hello!

2311
01:51:26,110 --> 01:51:26,590
Hello!

2312
01:51:27,390 --> 01:51:27,770
Hello!

2313
01:51:29,170 --> 01:51:29,750
Hello!

2314
01:51:33,640 --> 01:51:35,300
I hate raising kids.

2315
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:48,720
These kids...

2316
01:51:48,720 --> 01:51:50,500
They're so...

2317
01:51:50,500 --> 01:51:52,280
They don't know what's good for them.

2318
01:51:52,860 --> 01:51:59,380
They take things for granted.

2319
01:51:59,960 --> 01:52:03,980
I am trying my best to raise them.

2320
01:52:04,220 --> 01:52:06,040
But do they care?

2321
01:52:06,800 --> 01:52:07,260
Hello!

2322
01:52:09,280 --> 01:52:11,720
Do any of you care?

2323
01:52:12,780 --> 01:52:13,860
Do you care?

2324
01:52:14,160 --> 01:52:15,400
Do you care?

2325
01:52:16,360 --> 01:52:16,960
Do you?

2326
01:52:17,340 --> 01:52:18,100
Do you?

2327
01:52:19,220 --> 01:52:19,860
Hello!

2328
01:52:21,480 --> 01:52:22,380
Hello!

2329
01:52:24,200 --> 01:52:25,820
Talk to me!

2330
01:52:26,260 --> 01:52:26,780
Baby!

2331
01:52:27,540 --> 01:52:27,960
Baby!

2332
01:52:33,660 --> 01:52:37,340
I brought you into this world, baby!

2333
01:52:37,820 --> 01:52:43,280
How come before they were talking to me, they were like...

2334
01:52:43,280 --> 01:52:44,300
No, no, no.

2335
01:52:45,620 --> 01:52:46,760
They were like...

2336
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:49,600
They were like moving their heads back and forth!

2337
01:52:50,120 --> 01:52:50,320
Hello!

2338
01:52:51,080 --> 01:52:51,520
Hello!

2339
01:52:52,720 --> 01:52:53,060
Hello!

2340
01:52:54,020 --> 01:52:54,800
They're like...

2341
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:55,720
You talking to me?

2342
01:52:57,120 --> 01:52:59,360
They like moved their heads back and forth!

2343
01:53:00,760 --> 01:53:05,780
They like acknowledged me at one point and now they don't?

2344
01:53:06,760 --> 01:53:09,820
They don't even care about me anymore!

2345
01:53:14,560 --> 01:53:16,460
Why don't you care?

2346
01:53:17,640 --> 01:53:19,680
Why don't you care?

2347
01:53:20,680 --> 01:53:22,740
Why don't you care?

2348
01:53:23,560 --> 01:53:24,700
I don't...

2349
01:53:24,700 --> 01:53:26,760
I don't understand.

2350
01:53:27,480 --> 01:53:29,120
I don't understand.

2351
01:53:29,360 --> 01:53:30,340
I don't care.

2352
01:53:30,980 --> 01:53:31,540
Hello!

2353
01:53:33,100 --> 01:53:34,220
You!

2354
01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:36,380
Baby!

2355
01:53:37,640 --> 01:53:38,020
Baby!

2356
01:53:43,920 --> 01:53:45,040
Fish!

2357
01:53:45,680 --> 01:53:46,220
Kill man!

2358
01:53:46,980 --> 01:53:48,480
Kill man!

2359
01:53:50,720 --> 01:53:51,520
Kill man!

2360
01:53:53,400 --> 01:53:55,080
Kill man!

2361
01:53:55,080 --> 01:53:55,440
Man!

2362
01:54:03,650 --> 01:54:05,410
I can't...

2363
01:54:05,410 --> 01:54:05,950
I can't...

2364
01:54:05,950 --> 01:54:08,210
They hate me.

2365
01:54:08,730 --> 01:54:10,050
I'll come back tomorrow.

2366
01:54:11,030 --> 01:54:13,030
I'll come back tomorrow.

2367
01:54:17,010 --> 01:54:19,330
These fucking kids.

2368
01:54:22,490 --> 01:54:25,450
Maybe they'll talk to me tomorrow, guys.

2369
01:54:26,070 --> 01:54:26,510
Maybe...

2370
01:54:26,950 --> 01:54:29,270
Maybe they'll talk to me tomorrow!

2371
01:54:31,310 --> 01:54:32,430
I believe.

2372
01:54:33,670 --> 01:54:38,270
Maybe tomorrow is that day that they decided to talk to me.

2373
01:54:41,560 --> 01:54:43,710
Okay, I need to make sure if it's correct.

2374
01:54:43,790 --> 01:54:44,430
Okay, yeah.

2375
01:54:44,910 --> 01:54:45,370
Alright.

2376
01:54:47,590 --> 01:54:48,950
At 5 AM.

2377
01:54:49,170 --> 01:54:52,130
That's right, mom's coming back home at 5 in the morning.

2378
01:54:57,540 --> 01:54:58,600
Mom's back.

2379
01:55:00,080 --> 01:55:03,460
She'll keep coming back until you fucking talk to her.

2380
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,340
She'll keep coming back!

2381
01:55:08,680 --> 01:55:12,560
She'll never leave until you talk to me!

2382
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:15,080
That's all I want!

2383
01:55:35,960 --> 01:55:37,020
I'm not erratic!

2384
01:55:37,140 --> 01:55:38,660
I just love them very much!

2385
01:55:42,940 --> 01:55:44,840
I just love my children!

2386
01:55:45,320 --> 01:55:47,480
I love all 8 of them!

2387
01:55:48,580 --> 01:55:50,180
Why is he calling me out?

2388
01:55:50,220 --> 01:55:53,160
I just want to make sure they grow up nice, big, and strong!

2389
01:55:54,640 --> 01:55:55,080
Okay.

2390
01:55:57,740 --> 01:55:58,900
Oh my god.

2391
01:55:59,080 --> 01:56:01,780
They're fucking complaining about how cold it is.

2392
01:56:01,860 --> 01:56:04,180
I'm doing my best, children.

2393
01:56:05,500 --> 01:56:06,020
Um...

2394
01:56:06,020 --> 01:56:10,800
I literally came back- I'm here at 5 in the morning, children.

2395
01:56:11,800 --> 01:56:13,180
Why are you complaining?

2396
01:56:13,360 --> 01:56:14,480
How are they dying?

2397
01:56:15,320 --> 01:56:20,660
I came back at 5 in the morning and then Nemo was like, Why do you keep coming back?

2398
01:56:20,840 --> 01:56:23,760
I don't know, because my kids keep fucking dying, I guess.

2399
01:56:26,320 --> 01:56:26,840
Okay.

2400
01:56:28,140 --> 01:56:29,060
Air time.

2401
01:56:29,240 --> 01:56:30,880
And then they need to breathe, too.

2402
01:56:34,180 --> 01:56:35,220
I'm not overfeeding them.

2403
01:56:35,280 --> 01:56:36,040
They're fine.

2404
01:56:36,280 --> 01:56:37,140
Look at them.

2405
01:56:38,280 --> 01:56:39,800
I feed them 3 times a day.

2406
01:56:40,040 --> 01:56:42,260
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

2407
01:56:42,560 --> 01:56:44,600
That's like adequate feed time.

2408
01:56:46,220 --> 01:56:48,400
They're not- They're not even talking to me.

2409
01:56:48,480 --> 01:56:49,420
They're just complaining.

2410
01:56:49,880 --> 01:56:52,720
They're complaining at me, not talking to me.

2411
01:56:54,240 --> 01:56:57,000
It's like when you wake up and you're like, Mom, I'm hungry.

2412
01:56:57,400 --> 01:56:57,700
Yeah?

2413
01:56:57,860 --> 01:56:58,780
How was your day?

2414
01:57:00,120 --> 01:57:02,840
And then they come back from school and it's like, Mom!

2415
01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:03,880
Mom!

2416
01:57:04,360 --> 01:57:05,460
I want food!

2417
01:57:06,100 --> 01:57:07,360
And then I'm like, what?

2418
01:57:07,400 --> 01:57:09,260
You don't want to tell me about the day you had?

2419
01:57:09,400 --> 01:57:10,180
How was school?

2420
01:57:10,420 --> 01:57:12,260
Oh, you don't want to mention how school was?

2421
01:57:12,480 --> 01:57:14,940
All you want to do is fucking demand food?

2422
01:57:15,280 --> 01:57:16,820
That's the kids right now.

2423
01:57:17,140 --> 01:57:18,000
That's them.

2424
01:57:18,680 --> 01:57:19,200
Anyway.

2425
01:57:20,900 --> 01:57:21,420
Child.

2426
01:57:22,120 --> 01:57:22,540
Baby.

2427
01:57:23,700 --> 01:57:24,080
Hello?

2428
01:57:24,340 --> 01:57:24,480
Oh!

2429
01:57:24,660 --> 01:57:24,780
Oh!

2430
01:57:25,320 --> 01:57:25,560
Oh!

2431
01:57:25,740 --> 01:57:26,020
Wait!

2432
01:57:27,260 --> 01:57:27,780
Baby!

2433
01:57:29,200 --> 01:57:29,720
Gilman!

2434
01:57:30,420 --> 01:57:30,900
Oh!

2435
01:57:30,900 --> 01:57:31,920
Gilman!

2436
01:57:32,200 --> 01:57:32,740
Talk!

2437
01:57:33,360 --> 01:57:33,920
Talk!

2438
01:57:37,510 --> 01:57:37,990
Wait.

2439
01:57:38,630 --> 01:57:39,650
Wait, he's like...

2440
01:57:39,650 --> 01:57:40,890
Is he trying to talk to me?

2441
01:57:42,790 --> 01:57:43,650
Was that...

2442
01:57:43,650 --> 01:57:44,270
Was that him?

2443
01:57:44,850 --> 01:57:45,730
I don't know.

2444
01:57:45,790 --> 01:57:46,190
I don't know.

2445
01:57:46,250 --> 01:57:46,910
I can't tell.

2446
01:57:48,310 --> 01:57:49,490
I can't tell.

2447
01:57:50,970 --> 01:57:53,310
Is he looking around because he wants to talk to me?

2448
01:57:54,030 --> 01:57:54,390
Hello?

2449
01:57:55,870 --> 01:57:56,970
Little child.

2450
01:57:58,530 --> 01:58:00,790
I can't tell if he's reacting to me.

2451
01:58:02,650 --> 01:58:03,670
He says...

2452
01:58:03,670 --> 01:58:04,990
Fuck off.

2453
01:58:05,650 --> 01:58:07,790
He's telling you to go away.

2454
01:58:08,630 --> 01:58:09,890
I can't tell!

2455
01:58:11,790 --> 01:58:12,430
Ma!

2456
01:58:12,990 --> 01:58:15,410
That weird cat is back.

2457
01:58:15,890 --> 01:58:17,250
Thank you for the super chat.

2458
01:58:17,410 --> 01:58:17,790
Thank you.

2459
01:58:17,850 --> 01:58:18,990
Thank you.

2460
01:58:19,590 --> 01:58:21,310
Thank you.

2461
01:58:21,350 --> 01:58:24,310
Thank you for the super chat.

2462
01:58:24,490 --> 01:58:24,870
Thank you.

2463
01:58:24,930 --> 01:58:25,650
Thank you.

2464
01:58:25,790 --> 01:58:27,490
Okay, let me give him food.

2465
01:58:28,710 --> 01:58:30,430
Wait, will I get more food later?

2466
01:58:31,050 --> 01:58:31,850
Am I...

2467
01:58:31,850 --> 01:58:33,710
Do they not replenish my food?

2468
01:58:34,570 --> 01:58:34,830
Wait.

2469
01:58:39,270 --> 01:58:40,110
I don't know.

2470
01:58:42,490 --> 01:58:44,030
Wait, they don't?

2471
01:58:45,650 --> 01:58:46,150
Oh!

2472
01:58:48,210 --> 01:58:48,950
Oh, fuck.

2473
01:58:49,050 --> 01:58:49,310
Okay.

2474
01:58:50,010 --> 01:58:50,370
Okay.

2475
01:58:50,650 --> 01:58:52,230
Sorry, no food for now.

2476
01:58:53,290 --> 01:58:54,470
Sorry, no food.

2477
01:58:54,550 --> 01:58:56,390
Apparently, you guys don't get more food.

2478
01:58:57,170 --> 01:58:59,150
Oh, I did not realize it's limited.

2479
01:59:00,390 --> 01:59:00,730
I...

2480
01:59:03,300 --> 01:59:03,980
Hello!

2481
01:59:07,800 --> 01:59:08,380
Hello!

2482
01:59:11,240 --> 01:59:13,820
I don't know if they care.

2483
01:59:14,120 --> 01:59:15,180
I don't know.

2484
01:59:16,140 --> 01:59:16,720
Hello!

2485
01:59:19,080 --> 01:59:19,660
Hello!

2486
01:59:23,160 --> 01:59:23,740
Hello?

2487
01:59:25,300 --> 01:59:25,880
Hello!

2488
01:59:28,910 --> 01:59:29,970
Hello!

2489
01:59:30,650 --> 01:59:32,010
Why do you keep shaking your head?

2490
01:59:32,990 --> 01:59:33,570
Speak!

2491
01:59:34,750 --> 01:59:35,570
Get all mad.

2492
01:59:36,470 --> 01:59:36,950
Speak!

2493
01:59:37,930 --> 01:59:39,590
Don't look at me like that!

2494
01:59:40,150 --> 01:59:41,530
I'm your fucking mother!

2495
01:59:43,510 --> 01:59:45,290
Don't give me that face!

2496
01:59:45,910 --> 01:59:47,270
Speak, yo man!

2497
01:59:48,010 --> 01:59:48,610
Speak!

2498
01:59:51,510 --> 01:59:52,190
Speak!

2499
01:59:54,530 --> 01:59:56,630
Oh my god, and he fucking walked away.

2500
01:59:59,770 --> 02:00:02,010
You can't pick them up!

2501
02:00:02,350 --> 02:00:03,370
I tried!

2502
02:00:03,750 --> 02:00:05,690
All I can do is do this!

2503
02:00:09,050 --> 02:00:10,570
I can tickle them!

2504
02:00:11,750 --> 02:00:13,610
I'm giving them a little tickle!

2505
02:00:14,770 --> 02:00:16,570
You like that little tickle?

2506
02:00:16,990 --> 02:00:18,070
Yeah, do you like that?

2507
02:00:18,710 --> 02:00:20,770
Oh, you like that, you little fucking...

2508
02:00:21,350 --> 02:00:22,130
You like that?

2509
02:00:24,590 --> 02:00:25,710
I can...

2510
02:00:25,710 --> 02:00:26,990
Yeah, I can't grab them.

2511
02:00:27,990 --> 02:00:29,690
All I can do is just...

2512
02:00:31,870 --> 02:00:33,090
That's all I can do.

2513
02:00:35,450 --> 02:00:37,210
I can give them little tickles.

2514
02:00:37,970 --> 02:00:38,710
That's right.

2515
02:00:39,250 --> 02:00:40,450
The tickle time!

2516
02:00:41,330 --> 02:00:42,110
Woah, woah, woah!

2517
02:00:42,410 --> 02:00:44,170
That's right, little tickle time!

2518
02:00:44,830 --> 02:00:46,050
How do I drag them?

2519
02:00:46,110 --> 02:00:46,650
No, I can't.

2520
02:00:47,650 --> 02:00:49,310
I definitely cannot drag them.

2521
02:00:51,810 --> 02:00:52,210
Alright.

2522
02:00:54,290 --> 02:00:56,110
I can't do anything else right now.

2523
02:00:57,390 --> 02:00:59,690
Okay, I'm coming back in a couple of hours.

2524
02:00:59,930 --> 02:01:02,090
How long does it take for them to grow, guys?

2525
02:01:02,090 --> 02:01:04,890
So they can actually talk to me.

2526
02:01:05,210 --> 02:01:07,350
How long does it take for them to grow?

2527
02:01:07,930 --> 02:01:09,710
Wait, right trigger plus X?

2528
02:01:14,060 --> 02:01:15,320
Wait, right trigger...

2529
02:01:17,760 --> 02:01:18,480
No?

2530
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:20,720
Nope.

2531
02:01:21,220 --> 02:01:22,580
It doesn't let me grab.

2532
02:01:24,860 --> 02:01:25,940
Oh, oh!

2533
02:01:29,500 --> 02:01:31,320
Can he die?

2534
02:01:32,220 --> 02:01:34,120
What the fuck?

2535
02:01:35,320 --> 02:01:37,460
What the fuck am I doing?

2536
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:42,100
That's right, suffocate.

2537
02:01:45,920 --> 02:01:47,360
What the fuck?

2538
02:01:51,920 --> 02:01:55,320
What the fuck?

2539
02:01:59,760 --> 02:02:02,820
What the fuck?

2540
02:02:03,380 --> 02:02:04,140
That's right.

2541
02:02:04,840 --> 02:02:05,260
Cry.

2542
02:02:06,300 --> 02:02:08,760
That's what you get for not speaking to your mother.

2543
02:02:09,380 --> 02:02:10,540
Speak to your mother!

2544
02:02:11,440 --> 02:02:13,180
That's right, speak to me!

2545
02:02:14,420 --> 02:02:15,480
Alright, there you go.

2546
02:02:15,940 --> 02:02:16,700
Now they'll know.

2547
02:02:19,200 --> 02:02:22,580
No, he's not.

2548
02:02:22,660 --> 02:02:23,260
He's fine.

2549
02:02:23,900 --> 02:02:24,860
Look at him, he's okay.

2550
02:02:31,700 --> 02:02:32,980
Oh, no, he's okay.

2551
02:02:33,180 --> 02:02:33,800
He's breathing.

2552
02:02:33,800 --> 02:02:35,600
Oh, thank God he's breathing.

2553
02:02:35,840 --> 02:02:38,040
Oh, he's...

2554
02:02:38,040 --> 02:02:39,640
Look, see, he's okay, guys.

2555
02:02:39,860 --> 02:02:40,360
See, look.

2556
02:02:40,800 --> 02:02:41,540
Look, he's okay.

2557
02:02:41,900 --> 02:02:43,600
He's okay, guys.

2558
02:02:44,220 --> 02:02:45,340
Look, he's okay.

2559
02:02:45,700 --> 02:02:47,780
He's okay, he's okay, he's okay.

2560
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:48,840
I didn't...

2561
02:02:48,840 --> 02:02:52,720
I didn't accidentally kill anybody.

2562
02:02:58,540 --> 02:02:59,900
He's okay, everyone.

2563
02:03:00,180 --> 02:03:01,600
He's okay.

2564
02:03:02,060 --> 02:03:03,020
He's okay.

2565
02:03:03,020 --> 02:03:03,840
Alright.

2566
02:03:04,800 --> 02:03:06,520
I'll feed you guys later.

2567
02:03:07,320 --> 02:03:10,220
I am gonna make sure...

2568
02:03:10,220 --> 02:03:12,080
I'm coming back in a couple of hours, children.

2569
02:03:12,560 --> 02:03:13,960
Do not worry.

2570
02:03:16,840 --> 02:03:19,880
I'm coming back in a couple of hours, babies.

2571
02:03:22,520 --> 02:03:23,880
You'll be fine.

2572
02:03:26,040 --> 02:03:27,480
We'll be fine.

2573
02:03:28,320 --> 02:03:28,780
Okay.

2574
02:03:32,200 --> 02:03:33,260
And a 10.

2575
02:03:34,240 --> 02:03:35,580
How long does it take for them to grow?

2576
02:03:37,600 --> 02:03:39,040
I have no idea.

2577
02:03:39,520 --> 02:03:43,020
I can't tell how long it takes for these kids to grow.

2578
02:03:43,300 --> 02:03:44,920
It feels like...

2579
02:03:44,920 --> 02:03:46,440
It feels like...

2580
02:03:54,450 --> 02:03:55,010
Oh.

2581
02:03:55,450 --> 02:03:56,390
Oh, my God.

2582
02:03:57,130 --> 02:04:04,850
Somebody said, like, weeks, and then I was like...

2583
02:04:04,850 --> 02:04:07,270
I was like...

2584
02:04:07,650 --> 02:04:09,310
There's no way.

2585
02:04:10,370 --> 02:04:10,890
Good morning.

2586
02:04:21,950 --> 02:04:22,950
See,

2587
02:04:26,190 --> 02:04:26,750
they're fine.

2588
02:04:27,530 --> 02:04:28,490
They're fine.

2589
02:04:30,630 --> 02:04:32,550
They're fine, the kids are still okay.

2590
02:04:33,830 --> 02:04:37,370
I picked one up, and all I did was give it emotional trauma.

2591
02:04:37,570 --> 02:04:39,990
But other than that, the kids are alright.

2592
02:04:42,710 --> 02:04:45,930
They seem to be reacting positively to my care.

2593
02:04:46,810 --> 02:04:48,170
Which is good to know.

2594
02:04:50,050 --> 02:04:50,570
Okay.

2595
02:04:51,410 --> 02:04:53,650
Oh, everything is still okay, that's good.

2596
02:04:55,610 --> 02:04:56,130
Hello.

2597
02:04:57,710 --> 02:04:58,230
Baby.

2598
02:04:58,230 --> 02:04:58,850
Baby.

2599
02:05:00,450 --> 02:05:02,810
When he said hello back, where the fuck is he?

2600
02:05:02,930 --> 02:05:03,790
Is he in the void?

2601
02:05:04,350 --> 02:05:05,710
Where did you swim to?

2602
02:05:09,430 --> 02:05:10,190
Oh, my God.

2603
02:05:10,250 --> 02:05:11,430
Wait, did he respond back?

2604
02:05:11,490 --> 02:05:12,190
I said hello.

2605
02:05:14,930 --> 02:05:15,410
Okay.

2606
02:05:16,310 --> 02:05:17,590
Do I feed them now?

2607
02:05:20,230 --> 02:05:21,130
They evolve.

2608
02:05:21,830 --> 02:05:23,850
Do I get more food or no?

2609
02:05:23,850 --> 02:05:27,690
Or is this all the food I'm gonna get for the rest of their lives?

2610
02:05:29,310 --> 02:05:32,070
When they evolve, do I not get more?

2611
02:05:33,790 --> 02:05:34,310
Oh.

2612
02:05:35,550 --> 02:05:36,070
Okay.

2613
02:05:37,710 --> 02:05:40,090
Alright, I'm gonna evolve you guys again.

2614
02:05:40,850 --> 02:05:41,370
Okay.

2615
02:05:42,350 --> 02:05:43,290
Oh, that's awkward.

2616
02:05:47,290 --> 02:05:49,270
I'll come back for you guys soon.

2617
02:05:54,050 --> 02:05:55,310
That's a little awkward.

2618
02:05:55,490 --> 02:05:56,190
That's fine.

2619
02:05:58,130 --> 02:05:59,050
That's fine.

2620
02:06:00,750 --> 02:06:01,230
Okay.

2621
02:06:04,350 --> 02:06:06,270
Come back here.

2622
02:06:07,210 --> 02:06:09,490
That should be enough time for them to grow, right?

2623
02:06:09,670 --> 02:06:12,470
I don't know how many days it's been for these children now.

2624
02:06:12,590 --> 02:06:14,390
How long have I been taking care of them?

2625
02:06:14,870 --> 02:06:16,850
I feel like...

2626
02:06:17,970 --> 02:06:21,470
I've like lost track of how long I've been taking care of them.

2627
02:06:21,470 --> 02:06:23,970
It feels like I've been taking care of them for years now.

2628
02:06:24,530 --> 02:06:27,750
There's no way it's been one day.

2629
02:06:30,590 --> 02:06:31,270
Three?

2630
02:06:31,610 --> 02:06:34,930
Okay, one more day and then they'll finally move out, right?

2631
02:06:35,810 --> 02:06:40,610
One more day and then my Gilman will move out, right guys?

2632
02:06:41,970 --> 02:06:42,610
Surely.

2633
02:06:47,930 --> 02:06:48,610
Yeah.

2634
02:06:53,850 --> 02:06:56,690
I'm trying my best!

2635
02:06:58,170 --> 02:06:59,590
They keep being cold!

2636
02:07:12,010 --> 02:07:12,830
Okay.

2637
02:07:13,590 --> 02:07:18,510
Do I need a... How many times do I have to feed them?

2638
02:07:18,510 --> 02:07:22,110
Do I have to feed them per day or can I like not feed them after a while?

2639
02:07:22,770 --> 02:07:23,610
Okay, let's see.

2640
02:07:23,730 --> 02:07:23,930
Air.

2641
02:07:24,150 --> 02:07:25,010
It's still good.

2642
02:07:25,110 --> 02:07:26,230
Air is still good.

2643
02:07:26,610 --> 02:07:27,890
That's good to know.

2644
02:07:29,390 --> 02:07:30,410
What about heat?

2645
02:07:33,470 --> 02:07:34,490
One per day?

2646
02:07:34,730 --> 02:07:35,710
Okay, it's time.

2647
02:07:35,830 --> 02:07:37,910
It's feeding time, my little children.

2648
02:07:39,330 --> 02:07:39,810
Hello!

2649
02:07:42,390 --> 02:07:42,870
Hello!

2650
02:07:44,990 --> 02:07:46,670
I fucking hate my kids.

2651
02:07:49,940 --> 02:07:51,160
I don't feed them?

2652
02:07:51,360 --> 02:07:51,940
Did I not feed them?

2653
02:07:51,980 --> 02:07:53,000
I didn't feed them yesterday.

2654
02:07:54,320 --> 02:07:55,520
Did I not feed them?

2655
02:07:55,620 --> 02:07:56,640
I thought I did!

2656
02:07:58,140 --> 02:07:59,500
I don't remember.

2657
02:08:00,160 --> 02:08:04,180
Guys, I don't remember if I fed them or not.

2658
02:08:04,380 --> 02:08:04,880
I don't...

2659
02:08:10,080 --> 02:08:12,360
They can starve a little, fuck it.

2660
02:08:12,440 --> 02:08:12,900
You're right.

2661
02:08:13,600 --> 02:08:14,560
Goodbye, kids.

2662
02:08:22,920 --> 02:08:26,140
They can starve a little bit.

2663
02:08:26,260 --> 02:08:27,140
It's fine.

2664
02:08:27,400 --> 02:08:28,760
It's fine.

2665
02:08:29,220 --> 02:08:30,840
I'll see you tomorrow, children.

2666
02:08:31,100 --> 02:08:33,240
I'll see you tomorrow.

2667
02:08:34,060 --> 02:08:37,120
I'll visit you at exactly midnight.

2668
02:08:40,500 --> 02:08:41,880
I'll feed them at midnight.

2669
02:08:42,200 --> 02:08:43,820
That's good enough.

2670
02:08:50,180 --> 02:08:51,840
Alright, don't worry.

2671
02:08:52,360 --> 02:08:53,560
I'm back, kids.

2672
02:08:56,580 --> 02:08:58,760
I feel like it's a new day.

2673
02:08:58,860 --> 02:08:59,700
It's time to eat.

2674
02:09:00,720 --> 02:09:02,200
It's time to eat, children.

2675
02:09:02,360 --> 02:09:03,280
It's a new day.

2676
02:09:07,590 --> 02:09:08,030
I am?

2677
02:09:22,290 --> 02:09:24,090
Oh, there's still eight.

2678
02:09:29,830 --> 02:09:31,330
They're always cold.

2679
02:09:32,690 --> 02:09:34,570
They're always cold.

2680
02:09:34,870 --> 02:09:36,530
When are they not cold?

2681
02:09:36,930 --> 02:09:40,390
They always demand me to fucking fix the heat.

2682
02:09:41,370 --> 02:09:43,370
Are they paying the bills for this heater?

2683
02:09:43,690 --> 02:09:44,610
No, they're not.

2684
02:09:50,210 --> 02:09:51,610
Oh my god, why are you crying?

2685
02:09:53,110 --> 02:09:57,850
Are you the one that's trying to fucking make the ends meet right now trying to care for eight kids?

2686
02:09:58,210 --> 02:09:59,830
I'm a fucking single mother.

2687
02:10:00,330 --> 02:10:01,750
Your dad died.

2688
02:10:04,030 --> 02:10:07,890
You fucking ate his inside out and now he's dead.

2689
02:10:11,110 --> 02:10:13,390
Like, what the fuck am I supposed to do?

2690
02:10:15,230 --> 02:10:17,410
Oh, now they're complaining it's too hot.

2691
02:10:17,630 --> 02:10:18,490
It's too hot.

2692
02:10:22,770 --> 02:10:24,810
They literally killed their father.

2693
02:10:25,290 --> 02:10:27,010
We all saw it.

2694
02:10:29,250 --> 02:10:30,710
And nobody helped him.

2695
02:10:30,990 --> 02:10:35,150
I asked if there was a fish doctor and nobody came and helped him.

2696
02:10:35,370 --> 02:10:37,070
We all watched him die.

2697
02:10:42,510 --> 02:10:43,150
Alright.

2698
02:10:44,210 --> 02:10:45,150
It's a hundred.

2699
02:10:45,470 --> 02:10:47,030
Now you guys can breathe.

2700
02:10:47,890 --> 02:10:48,230
Alright.

2701
02:10:48,790 --> 02:10:49,850
Can I feed them now?

2702
02:10:51,490 --> 02:10:52,830
Hello, little guys.

2703
02:10:53,010 --> 02:10:53,810
Are you guys growing?

2704
02:10:53,990 --> 02:10:55,370
You're not even growing.

2705
02:10:55,570 --> 02:10:58,130
I'm supposed to feed them after midnight.

2706
02:10:59,350 --> 02:11:00,230
Imagination art.

2707
02:11:00,470 --> 02:11:01,430
Thank you for the super chat.

2708
02:11:01,530 --> 02:11:01,910
Thank you.

2709
02:11:02,270 --> 02:11:02,570
Thank you.

2710
02:11:03,430 --> 02:11:04,590
Are you hungry?

2711
02:11:05,130 --> 02:11:06,210
Are you hungry?

2712
02:11:06,670 --> 02:11:07,510
Let me know.

2713
02:11:08,290 --> 02:11:09,410
Do you need food?

2714
02:11:09,870 --> 02:11:10,150
Hello?

2715
02:11:11,510 --> 02:11:13,130
Do you need food?

2716
02:11:13,310 --> 02:11:13,710
Fish?

2717
02:11:13,950 --> 02:11:14,310
Food?

2718
02:11:16,250 --> 02:11:16,850
Fish?

2719
02:11:17,210 --> 02:11:17,670
Food?

2720
02:11:24,590 --> 02:11:25,310
Hungry?

2721
02:11:25,310 --> 02:11:26,030
Hungry?

2722
02:11:35,330 --> 02:11:36,750
Goodbye, kids.

2723
02:11:37,210 --> 02:11:39,510
I'll give you food when it's morning.

2724
02:11:41,970 --> 02:11:44,270
Stop insisting on the food.

2725
02:11:44,570 --> 02:11:46,630
But when do I feed them?

2726
02:11:46,990 --> 02:11:50,790
If I don't feed them now, when do I feed them?

2727
02:11:53,730 --> 02:11:54,970
Okay, it's 8am.

2728
02:11:55,130 --> 02:11:55,890
Now you feed.

2729
02:11:56,190 --> 02:11:57,470
Now you get food, right?

2730
02:12:02,040 --> 02:12:03,280
They're not orphans.

2731
02:12:03,360 --> 02:12:04,480
I'm still alive.

2732
02:12:08,310 --> 02:12:10,730
How are they orphans when I'm still here?

2733
02:12:15,120 --> 02:12:16,620
Okay, I'll feed them here.

2734
02:12:20,480 --> 02:12:22,720
If anything, I'm gonna be a...

2735
02:12:23,920 --> 02:12:26,040
If anything, I won't be a mother soon.

2736
02:12:45,260 --> 02:12:45,640
Okay.

2737
02:12:49,320 --> 02:12:50,420
Okay, wait until they say he's hungry.

2738
02:12:50,600 --> 02:12:51,420
Okay, I'll wait there.

2739
02:12:51,740 --> 02:12:52,940
Great, thank you for the super chat.

2740
02:12:53,060 --> 02:12:53,300
Thank you.

2741
02:12:53,320 --> 02:12:53,720
Thank you.

2742
02:12:53,860 --> 02:12:54,520
Dad died.

2743
02:12:54,720 --> 02:12:56,040
Yes, we were all there.

2744
02:12:56,420 --> 02:12:58,100
We all saw him die.

2745
02:12:58,100 --> 02:13:00,340
In fact, he even suffered.

2746
02:13:01,560 --> 02:13:04,140
He 100% suffered too.

2747
02:13:04,800 --> 02:13:07,000
Okay, they're still fine.

2748
02:13:07,080 --> 02:13:07,340
Alright.

2749
02:13:07,820 --> 02:13:09,680
I'm not even gonna look at you guys.

2750
02:13:09,740 --> 02:13:10,320
I'll be back.

2751
02:13:16,820 --> 02:13:19,900
I just look at them and be like, see ya.

2752
02:13:22,840 --> 02:13:23,880
You're alive.

2753
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:24,900
Alright, I'm leaving.

2754
02:13:25,460 --> 02:13:27,780
As long as you're alive, I get to leave.

2755
02:13:27,780 --> 02:13:28,380
Alright.

2756
02:13:30,560 --> 02:13:32,880
I'm just checking if they're alive.

2757
02:13:33,300 --> 02:13:34,560
At this point.

2758
02:13:39,540 --> 02:13:41,380
Mero, thank you for the super chat.

2759
02:13:41,500 --> 02:13:41,800
Thank you.

2760
02:13:41,860 --> 02:13:42,340
Thank you.

2761
02:13:42,440 --> 02:13:47,160
If you need more food, you can use a few semen as rations.

2762
02:13:47,940 --> 02:13:49,900
Survival of the fittest.

2763
02:13:50,220 --> 02:13:51,960
Thank you for the super chat.

2764
02:13:52,140 --> 02:13:52,680
Thank you.

2765
02:13:52,820 --> 02:13:53,340
Thank you.

2766
02:13:53,500 --> 02:13:54,820
Yeah, nobody died.

2767
02:13:55,260 --> 02:13:55,620
Bye.

2768
02:13:56,980 --> 02:14:00,620
Come back when you fucking evolve, my little fishies.

2769
02:14:13,820 --> 02:14:17,460
Oh, don't worry.

2770
02:14:17,560 --> 02:14:18,860
They're not getting that much.

2771
02:14:24,080 --> 02:14:24,680
Again?!

2772
02:14:29,360 --> 02:14:31,240
At least they're not hungry.

2773
02:14:32,600 --> 02:14:34,620
When do you evolve?!

2774
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:36,980
Evolve and move out!

2775
02:14:40,140 --> 02:14:42,620
When will you evolve?!

2776
02:14:47,880 --> 02:14:48,820
Why, boy?

2777
02:14:48,960 --> 02:14:50,340
Welcome to tomato farm.

2778
02:14:50,460 --> 02:14:51,240
Welcome, welcome.

2779
02:14:52,800 --> 02:14:53,300
It's okay.

2780
02:14:53,940 --> 02:14:55,520
We heat them up.

2781
02:14:58,900 --> 02:15:00,620
They're not dead yet.

2782
02:15:03,960 --> 02:15:05,380
Okay, is that good enough?

2783
02:15:06,640 --> 02:15:08,020
I'll do a little bit more.

2784
02:15:10,360 --> 02:15:10,880
Nice.

2785
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:11,860
Okay, just perfect.

2786
02:15:12,460 --> 02:15:13,940
And then we give them air.

2787
02:15:18,280 --> 02:15:20,240
Accidentally, I'm thanking you for the super chat.

2788
02:15:20,400 --> 02:15:20,600
Thank you.

2789
02:15:20,900 --> 02:15:21,220
Thank you.

2790
02:15:22,060 --> 02:15:24,300
Alright, and then we give them air.

2791
02:15:29,020 --> 02:15:30,180
Air!

2792
02:15:31,280 --> 02:15:32,020
Air!

2793
02:15:39,310 --> 02:15:39,890
Alright.

2794
02:15:43,030 --> 02:15:46,790
When will you be... When will you go to college?

2795
02:15:47,910 --> 02:15:48,690
When?

2796
02:15:50,190 --> 02:15:51,550
Go to college.

2797
02:15:52,590 --> 02:15:53,890
Go to college.

2798
02:15:54,670 --> 02:15:55,750
Move out.

2799
02:15:56,090 --> 02:15:56,930
Move out!

2800
02:15:58,770 --> 02:15:59,930
When?!

2801
02:16:06,750 --> 02:16:08,510
Become doctor!

2802
02:16:11,050 --> 02:16:11,950
Doctor!

2803
02:16:12,730 --> 02:16:13,390
Doctor!

2804
02:16:14,410 --> 02:16:15,270
Doctor!

2805
02:16:23,590 --> 02:16:26,850
I'll come back soon and then maybe you'll be doctor.

2806
02:16:29,950 --> 02:16:33,230
Red, welcome to the tomato farm.

2807
02:16:33,750 --> 02:16:34,950
Welcome, welcome.

2808
02:16:37,150 --> 02:16:39,270
Thank you for the super chat.

2809
02:16:39,650 --> 02:16:40,110
Thank you.

2810
02:16:40,290 --> 02:16:40,950
Thank you.

2811
02:16:41,050 --> 02:16:41,690
Give me a sec.

2812
02:16:41,790 --> 02:16:44,050
Let me turn the time up.

2813
02:16:46,550 --> 02:16:48,090
You can't say that.

2814
02:16:48,130 --> 02:16:50,570
It's your fault that I don't have a good childhood.

2815
02:16:51,070 --> 02:16:53,450
Because someone couldn't keep it in their past.

2816
02:16:53,690 --> 02:16:55,190
It's your fault!

2817
02:16:55,710 --> 02:16:57,110
The dad died!

2818
02:16:58,370 --> 02:17:02,670
Maybe if you didn't kill the father, I would be a happier person.

2819
02:17:12,710 --> 02:17:13,550
Alright.

2820
02:17:14,370 --> 02:17:15,710
How's the kids?

2821
02:17:20,410 --> 02:17:23,990
Oh, it's my fourth visit?

2822
02:17:27,490 --> 02:17:29,130
He keep freezing!

2823
02:17:29,470 --> 02:17:30,370
I have to keep visiting!

2824
02:17:43,010 --> 02:17:45,350
How do you still not evolve?

2825
02:17:46,990 --> 02:17:48,830
It's three days!

2826
02:17:49,870 --> 02:17:51,290
How are they still tiny?

2827
02:17:57,410 --> 02:17:58,890
Are you still tiny?

2828
02:17:59,810 --> 02:18:01,250
They're still tiny.

2829
02:18:02,230 --> 02:18:06,230
It's because they keep fucking... I keep having to put it at 20 because they'll freeze.

2830
02:18:08,670 --> 02:18:09,390
Hello.

2831
02:18:09,390 --> 02:18:09,790
Hello.

2832
02:18:11,490 --> 02:18:15,410
Killed your father and now I resent you for the rest of my life.

2833
02:18:15,930 --> 02:18:16,830
Okay, bye.

2834
02:18:24,970 --> 02:18:28,070
I always need to remind the children that it's their fault.

2835
02:18:31,410 --> 02:18:31,770
Alright.

2836
02:18:33,130 --> 02:18:35,010
Now a couple of hours next.

2837
02:18:35,330 --> 02:18:35,590
Okay.

2838
02:18:38,130 --> 02:18:39,890
Surely they're not dead yet, right?

2839
02:18:39,890 --> 02:18:41,850
The next day.

2840
02:18:41,930 --> 02:18:43,090
Okay, this is day three.

2841
02:18:44,210 --> 02:18:46,170
This is day three now.

2842
02:18:49,650 --> 02:18:51,310
What happens if you do one day?

2843
02:18:51,410 --> 02:18:55,150
We did one day and then the tank was empty.

2844
02:18:56,130 --> 02:18:58,470
Next day, thank you for the super chat.

2845
02:18:58,610 --> 02:18:59,790
Thank you, thank you.

2846
02:19:00,050 --> 02:19:04,090
This game is discriminating against people with short attention spans.

2847
02:19:04,710 --> 02:19:05,770
Thank you for the super chat.

2848
02:19:05,870 --> 02:19:06,970
Thank you, thank you.

2849
02:19:08,710 --> 02:19:09,350
Red.

2850
02:19:09,650 --> 02:19:14,150
No, it was inspired by PewDiePie playing Seaman ten plus years ago.

2851
02:19:14,570 --> 02:19:18,690
And that game lived right free in my head for the longest fucking time.

2852
02:19:21,470 --> 02:19:23,690
I didn't even realize other people played it.

2853
02:19:23,890 --> 02:19:26,310
I just remember watching PewDiePie play it.

2854
02:19:31,050 --> 02:19:32,750
They're always cold!

2855
02:19:42,410 --> 02:19:42,930
Okay.

2856
02:19:48,900 --> 02:19:51,240
Guys, there is no way I'm playing this in real time.

2857
02:19:51,820 --> 02:19:54,380
I do not...

2858
02:19:55,280 --> 02:20:00,360
There is no way I could ever play this in real time.

2859
02:20:01,680 --> 02:20:02,360
I don't even have time.

2860
02:20:02,440 --> 02:20:05,680
I even time traveled in Animal Crossing on the GameCube.

2861
02:20:12,420 --> 02:20:13,220
Alright.

2862
02:20:14,340 --> 02:20:14,900
Alright.

2863
02:20:14,900 --> 02:20:17,080
Maybe evolved you can stop freezing to death.

2864
02:20:19,540 --> 02:20:20,340
Alright.

2865
02:20:21,420 --> 02:20:22,760
Stop crying!

2866
02:20:23,660 --> 02:20:27,920
I fucking put it at 20 degrees plus every time and you've lived.

2867
02:20:29,200 --> 02:20:32,320
At this point your skin should have adapted to the hotness.

2868
02:20:37,150 --> 02:20:37,750
Alright.

2869
02:20:42,320 --> 02:20:44,020
Now you can breathe.

2870
02:20:47,040 --> 02:20:48,240
Alright, there we go.

2871
02:20:48,580 --> 02:20:49,600
Are you guys happy now?

2872
02:20:51,620 --> 02:20:53,320
Okay, fucker, I'm leaving.

2873
02:20:58,080 --> 02:21:00,200
Okay, I'm leaving after that.

2874
02:21:08,260 --> 02:21:09,500
Alright.

2875
02:21:11,800 --> 02:21:13,420
Fucking ungrateful little brats.

2876
02:21:15,520 --> 02:21:17,820
They actually was like, no!

2877
02:21:23,230 --> 02:21:25,730
Fucking little shits.

2878
02:21:27,690 --> 02:21:29,910
Uh, Taquita, thank you for the super chat.

2879
02:21:29,990 --> 02:21:30,930
Thank you, thank you.

2880
02:21:40,710 --> 02:21:46,250
I am giving so much love, care, and attention.

2881
02:21:46,710 --> 02:21:48,730
I come in there and be like...

2882
02:21:49,610 --> 02:21:50,550
Are you cold?

2883
02:21:50,890 --> 02:21:51,850
Are you cold?

2884
02:21:51,950 --> 02:21:52,710
And are you breathing?

2885
02:21:53,170 --> 02:21:53,690
You are?

2886
02:21:53,890 --> 02:21:54,890
Okay, I leave.

2887
02:21:55,950 --> 02:21:58,930
It is good to have you back so soon.

2888
02:22:00,310 --> 02:22:04,330
At the moment, the habitat contains eight human.

2889
02:22:04,790 --> 02:22:07,610
I have to grab them at least once a day?

2890
02:22:08,170 --> 02:22:10,270
They do not need that much love.

2891
02:22:12,850 --> 02:22:14,130
I'll pick one.

2892
02:22:14,790 --> 02:22:16,270
One won't be lucky enough.

2893
02:22:22,090 --> 02:22:23,990
Okay, let's see...

2894
02:22:24,830 --> 02:22:26,650
Alright, who's the lucky one?

2895
02:22:26,770 --> 02:22:27,110
You!

2896
02:22:28,550 --> 02:22:29,630
Yes, hello!

2897
02:22:31,930 --> 02:22:33,290
Oh, don't get out!

2898
02:22:33,410 --> 02:22:34,370
Don't get out!

2899
02:22:34,870 --> 02:22:35,890
That's right!

2900
02:22:36,730 --> 02:22:37,310
Whoa!

2901
02:22:37,950 --> 02:22:38,650
Oh, whoops.

2902
02:22:38,930 --> 02:22:40,290
Oh, that's...

2903
02:22:40,290 --> 02:22:41,330
Whoops, I did not mean that.

2904
02:22:41,810 --> 02:22:42,610
That's right!

2905
02:22:45,090 --> 02:22:46,010
That's right!

2906
02:22:46,130 --> 02:22:46,810
Om nom nom!

2907
02:22:47,130 --> 02:22:48,130
Put you in my mouth!

2908
02:22:48,350 --> 02:22:49,090
Om nom nom nom!

2909
02:22:51,530 --> 02:22:52,110
You!

2910
02:22:52,590 --> 02:22:52,990
Alright.

2911
02:22:53,850 --> 02:22:55,150
That's enough love now.

2912
02:22:56,410 --> 02:22:58,350
That was too much love.

2913
02:23:05,350 --> 02:23:08,590
Oh, that's enough love for the whole year, guys.

2914
02:23:08,990 --> 02:23:12,150
My intrusive thoughts keep being like, what if I...

2915
02:23:16,210 --> 02:23:18,870
What if I just won't?

2916
02:23:18,990 --> 02:23:21,090
What if I just won't?

2917
02:23:22,210 --> 02:23:23,250
Oh, goodbye!

2918
02:23:24,610 --> 02:23:26,610
Don't get out!

2919
02:23:28,250 --> 02:23:29,810
What if I just...

2920
02:23:36,570 --> 02:23:37,990
Don't get out!

2921
02:23:41,570 --> 02:23:42,770
I did it, okay?

2922
02:23:43,150 --> 02:23:48,970
I already spent so much time raising these fuckers.

2923
02:23:50,110 --> 02:23:52,310
Please, I just want to see them evolve!

2924
02:24:01,080 --> 02:24:02,160
Hello.

2925
02:24:08,080 --> 02:24:10,760
Yeah, are they... are they...

2926
02:24:10,760 --> 02:24:12,860
Are they grown-ups now?

2927
02:24:25,840 --> 02:24:27,160
Again?!

2928
02:24:28,200 --> 02:24:31,160
When will you be big?!

2929
02:24:35,840 --> 02:24:36,860
When?!

2930
02:24:36,860 --> 02:24:39,080
It's been three days!

2931
02:24:46,740 --> 02:24:47,760
Okay.

2932
02:24:48,960 --> 02:24:49,780
Okay.

2933
02:24:51,680 --> 02:24:53,000
It's okay.

2934
02:24:53,620 --> 02:24:55,180
I'm giving you more heat.

2935
02:24:58,160 --> 02:25:00,180
I'm giving them so much heat.

2936
02:25:01,400 --> 02:25:03,720
You'll be nice and warm now.

2937
02:25:04,940 --> 02:25:06,700
Okay, and then where's the air?

2938
02:25:07,080 --> 02:25:07,840
There it is.

2939
02:25:11,200 --> 02:25:11,820
Alright.

2940
02:25:12,580 --> 02:25:14,160
Now you can...

2941
02:25:15,320 --> 02:25:16,960
Now you get air.

2942
02:25:18,400 --> 02:25:22,600
They're so talk... Now they're so talk... They're always talkative when they want to complain!

2943
02:25:22,600 --> 02:25:24,020
Alright, children.

2944
02:25:24,920 --> 02:25:29,660
My chat wants me to visit you next and give you less attention, which is crazy, because I feel like...

2945
02:25:33,080 --> 02:25:38,780
I feel like I was giving just the right amount, but apparently I need to give even less.

2946
02:25:45,390 --> 02:25:48,710
So I guess I grab you real quick?

2947
02:25:48,890 --> 02:25:51,730
Alright, let's be... Let me grab you real quick.

2948
02:25:51,730 --> 02:25:53,330
Come on, let me grab you.

2949
02:25:53,550 --> 02:25:55,630
Oh, you thought you could run away?

2950
02:25:56,610 --> 02:25:57,990
You thought you could run away?

2951
02:25:58,110 --> 02:25:59,390
I have eight kids.

2952
02:25:59,610 --> 02:26:03,850
What's one... Maybe if I have one less, it'd be fine.

2953
02:26:08,990 --> 02:26:10,490
Alright, goodbye children.

2954
02:26:10,770 --> 02:26:12,790
You're not starving too, so it's fine.

2955
02:26:13,330 --> 02:26:15,570
I haven't fed you in two days, so it's okay.

2956
02:26:16,090 --> 02:26:16,570
Yeah, exactly.

2957
02:26:16,790 --> 02:26:18,050
One less mouth to feed?

2958
02:26:18,350 --> 02:26:19,670
Sounds like the dream.

2959
02:26:23,580 --> 02:26:27,320
Alright, we start visiting them twice a day, starting now.

2960
02:26:28,700 --> 02:26:29,400
Alright.

2961
02:26:31,080 --> 02:26:32,020
This is once.

2962
02:26:33,140 --> 02:26:33,900
Oh, wait.

2963
02:26:34,380 --> 02:26:34,800
Nine.

2964
02:26:35,940 --> 02:26:36,820
There we go.

2965
02:26:37,300 --> 02:26:38,460
It starts now.

2966
02:26:39,160 --> 02:26:40,240
We get less visits.

2967
02:26:40,460 --> 02:26:41,680
Less visitation rights.

2968
02:26:46,060 --> 02:26:48,520
Mama's on parole right now.

2969
02:26:48,900 --> 02:26:52,400
That means less visitation rights to see the kids.

2970
02:26:52,560 --> 02:26:54,200
Thank fucking god.

2971
02:26:58,650 --> 02:27:01,050
They'll cannibalize each other if you're not careful though.

2972
02:27:01,490 --> 02:27:02,190
Whoa!

2973
02:27:03,630 --> 02:27:06,010
Don't fucking give me hope there.

2974
02:27:14,890 --> 02:27:16,930
Greetings, and welcome back.

2975
02:27:17,730 --> 02:27:18,830
You're doing a good job.

2976
02:27:19,250 --> 02:27:24,350
At the moment, the habitat contains eight young men.

2977
02:27:25,610 --> 02:27:27,570
They are suffering from the cold.

2978
02:27:28,330 --> 02:27:32,030
Please use the heater to raise the temperature to a more comfortable level.

2979
02:27:32,630 --> 02:27:34,190
So let us head over to the tank.

2980
02:27:35,610 --> 02:27:37,690
They're still suffering from the cold?

2981
02:27:40,530 --> 02:27:43,710
When will you not suffer from the cold?

2982
02:27:48,230 --> 02:27:48,870
Okay.

2983
02:27:50,670 --> 02:27:53,830
Are they still suffering from- I don't understand.

2984
02:27:54,670 --> 02:27:56,350
How are you still cold?

2985
02:28:00,370 --> 02:28:03,690
Oh my god, I think the worst part is that the heater takes fucking forever.

2986
02:28:04,210 --> 02:28:06,390
It takes so long!

2987
02:28:06,390 --> 02:28:07,010
Die!

2988
02:28:09,510 --> 02:28:12,330
Oh my god, I wish it turns up faster.

2989
02:28:13,550 --> 02:28:16,030
Why don't I have this on automatic?

2990
02:28:16,130 --> 02:28:17,910
Okay, they're gonna burn a little bit, but that's alright.

2991
02:28:19,070 --> 02:28:19,890
That's alright.

2992
02:28:23,750 --> 02:28:24,230
Alright.

2993
02:28:25,290 --> 02:28:28,990
Okay, when will you guys start eating each other for the next evolution line?

2994
02:28:31,710 --> 02:28:33,910
Alright, 79, 80.

2995
02:28:39,570 --> 02:28:40,050
100.

2996
02:28:40,370 --> 02:28:41,750
Come on, give me that 100!

2997
02:28:42,930 --> 02:28:43,690
Come on!

2998
02:28:44,110 --> 02:28:46,170
Can I actually, like, cook them and they'll die?

2999
02:28:46,670 --> 02:28:50,930
Like, if I actually, like, just leave it on at, like, 50 degrees, do they actually start cooking?

3000
02:28:53,510 --> 02:28:54,390
I'm curious.

3001
02:28:55,730 --> 02:28:59,150
Alright, I apparently need to grab one of you guys every day.

3002
02:29:00,370 --> 02:29:01,110
I pick you.

3003
02:29:07,070 --> 02:29:08,650
That's right, little guy!

3004
02:29:09,270 --> 02:29:10,230
Wow, yeah?

3005
02:29:10,710 --> 02:29:13,010
That's right, are you having fun breathing oxygen?

3006
02:29:13,670 --> 02:29:15,670
Oh my god, yummy, yummy oxygen!

3007
02:29:16,350 --> 02:29:16,650
Okay.

3008
02:29:17,750 --> 02:29:18,850
Leave now.

3009
02:29:20,670 --> 02:29:22,490
I'm waiting for you guys to eat each other.

3010
02:29:22,970 --> 02:29:24,230
I can still wait.

3011
02:29:24,610 --> 02:29:25,690
I will wait.

3012
02:29:27,050 --> 02:29:30,510
I'll keep waiting until you eat each other.

3013
02:29:30,650 --> 02:29:32,410
And then I'll be happy.

3014
02:29:34,790 --> 02:29:35,430
Okay.

3015
02:29:35,990 --> 02:29:37,390
My second visit.

3016
02:29:42,520 --> 02:29:44,260
Alright, second visit.

3017
02:29:44,660 --> 02:29:45,740
Starting now.

3018
02:29:48,700 --> 02:29:50,620
Alright, are they still alive?

3019
02:29:55,510 --> 02:29:57,230
Oh, they have to do the thing?

3020
02:29:58,270 --> 02:29:59,890
But they didn't do it when I'm there.

3021
02:30:02,650 --> 02:30:03,250
Okay.

3022
02:30:05,290 --> 02:30:05,670
Alright.

3023
02:30:06,490 --> 02:30:12,190
The last one that doesn't get eaten will actually... and I'll say that I love you.

3024
02:30:13,290 --> 02:30:16,990
The one that eats all of them, I'll give you my love.

3025
02:30:16,990 --> 02:30:17,750
Hello.

3026
02:30:18,630 --> 02:30:21,950
Welcome to the laboratory of Jean-Paul Gasset.

3027
02:30:23,050 --> 02:30:25,330
This is your second visit today.

3028
02:30:26,190 --> 02:30:28,830
It is good to have you back so...

3029
02:30:28,830 --> 02:30:28,830
soon.

3030
02:30:30,690 --> 02:30:32,130
Is this day three?

3031
02:30:33,750 --> 02:30:35,270
Is this day three?

3032
02:30:37,150 --> 02:30:39,430
As always, is there anything new?

3033
02:30:42,190 --> 02:30:45,410
Alright, it's time!

3034
02:30:47,010 --> 02:30:48,310
Is this day four?

3035
02:30:48,610 --> 02:30:52,550
Alright guys, I'm staying here to watch you eat each other.

3036
02:30:53,510 --> 02:30:54,670
It's time.

3037
02:31:02,150 --> 02:31:05,450
Alright, the moment we get there, I'm ready.

3038
02:31:06,450 --> 02:31:07,850
To watch the feeding.

3039
02:31:10,010 --> 02:31:11,550
The great feeding.

3040
02:31:12,990 --> 02:31:13,830
Alright, you know what?

3041
02:31:13,950 --> 02:31:14,730
This is fine.

3042
02:31:14,730 --> 02:31:20,030
And then we'll give you some air so you'll... at least your brain can breathe a little bit when you eat each other.

3043
02:31:20,570 --> 02:31:24,110
Alright guys, mama's here to watch the great feeding.

3044
02:31:25,530 --> 02:31:26,970
No wonder you guys aren't hungry.

3045
02:31:29,530 --> 02:31:30,830
Alright, mama's here.

3046
02:31:32,070 --> 02:31:35,090
The one that lives actually gets mama's love.

3047
02:31:43,780 --> 02:31:45,420
What do you mean I have to speak English?

3048
02:31:47,220 --> 02:31:49,160
I have to tell them to speak English?

3049
02:31:49,300 --> 02:31:50,480
The fuck does that mean?

3050
02:31:55,330 --> 02:31:56,390
Alright, eat each other.

3051
02:31:56,750 --> 02:31:57,610
Get over here.

3052
02:32:04,460 --> 02:32:04,840
Alright.

3053
02:32:05,800 --> 02:32:06,440
English!

3054
02:32:09,380 --> 02:32:09,760
English.

3055
02:32:13,140 --> 02:32:14,300
I don't know.

3056
02:32:15,420 --> 02:32:15,860
English!

3057
02:32:18,960 --> 02:32:20,140
English or Spanish?

3058
02:32:20,440 --> 02:32:20,700
Okay.

3059
02:32:23,440 --> 02:32:27,700
I had to click on one of them?

3060
02:32:29,860 --> 02:32:31,260
English!

3061
02:32:38,410 --> 02:32:39,170
English!

3062
02:32:40,890 --> 02:32:41,490
English!

3063
02:32:41,490 --> 02:32:42,410
Speak English!

3064
02:32:45,680 --> 02:32:48,320
Speak English!

3065
02:32:50,960 --> 02:32:53,540
Speak English!

3066
02:32:55,060 --> 02:32:56,840
Guys, I don't think...

3067
02:32:56,840 --> 02:32:59,640
Speak English!

3068
02:33:01,280 --> 02:33:03,620
Oh my god, I fucking hate my kids.

3069
02:33:13,440 --> 02:33:15,320
They hate my children.

3070
02:33:16,260 --> 02:33:17,420
I hate them.

3071
02:33:28,730 --> 02:33:31,910
Oh my god, why are they like this?

3072
02:33:31,910 --> 02:33:34,490
Why the fuck are they like this?

3073
02:33:34,590 --> 02:33:35,390
What do I...

3074
02:33:35,870 --> 02:33:38,630
Please just eat each other.

3075
02:33:47,600 --> 02:33:48,720
Please.

3076
02:33:50,100 --> 02:33:50,540
Hello!

3077
02:33:52,380 --> 02:33:53,500
Fish!

3078
02:33:56,160 --> 02:33:57,280
Fish!

3079
02:33:58,760 --> 02:33:59,500
Hello!

3080
02:34:01,660 --> 02:34:03,560
Why did they ignore me?

3081
02:34:05,700 --> 02:34:08,020
Oh, tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle.

3082
02:34:08,340 --> 02:34:09,380
Tickle, tickle, tickle.

3083
02:34:09,780 --> 02:34:10,880
Tickle, tickle, tickle.

3084
02:34:11,760 --> 02:34:12,780
Yeah, cry.

3085
02:34:13,240 --> 02:34:14,400
Tickle, tickle, tickle.

3086
02:34:14,880 --> 02:34:16,100
Tickle, tickle, tickle.

3087
02:34:16,760 --> 02:34:17,900
Tickle, tickle!

3088
02:34:18,400 --> 02:34:19,000
Speak!

3089
02:34:20,060 --> 02:34:20,520
Okay.

3090
02:34:22,300 --> 02:34:23,720
Why are they not eating each other?

3091
02:34:23,900 --> 02:34:24,700
It's day four.

3092
02:34:26,940 --> 02:34:29,160
I was promised...

3093
02:34:29,160 --> 02:34:32,640
I was promised that you start cannibalizing each other.

3094
02:34:33,560 --> 02:34:35,940
I was promised food.

3095
02:34:38,420 --> 02:34:42,240
I am not absolutely sure my mic is working.

3096
02:34:42,500 --> 02:34:48,320
I am not absolutely sure, guys.

3097
02:34:53,320 --> 02:34:55,740
So I do not know.

3098
02:34:55,740 --> 02:34:56,200
Wow.

3099
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:03,980
I don't understand.

3100
02:35:04,080 --> 02:35:06,160
Do I have... Oh my God, I don't understand.

3101
02:35:06,380 --> 02:35:07,500
Why are they not speaking?

3102
02:35:12,480 --> 02:35:14,120
I don't understand.

3103
02:35:15,100 --> 02:35:17,200
Why are they not speaking?

3104
02:35:21,760 --> 02:35:23,580
Please, speak to me!

3105
02:35:25,460 --> 02:35:27,600
Okay, let me look at this real quick.

3106
02:35:28,640 --> 02:35:30,640
Maybe if I look at this...

3107
02:35:31,840 --> 02:35:32,420
Okay.

3108
02:35:34,260 --> 02:35:35,940
I'm looking at this guide.

3109
02:35:36,480 --> 02:35:41,880
I just...

3110
02:35:41,880 --> 02:35:45,240
Please, why don't you speak to me?

3111
02:35:45,920 --> 02:35:48,880
I've done so much for you!

3112
02:35:51,580 --> 02:35:52,560
Like...

3113
02:35:52,560 --> 02:35:54,100
I was promised!

3114
02:35:55,290 --> 02:35:57,500
I was promised cannibalism!

3115
02:36:00,060 --> 02:36:00,760
Speak!

3116
02:36:02,640 --> 02:36:04,040
Fish!

3117
02:36:05,100 --> 02:36:05,640
Fish!

3118
02:36:06,440 --> 02:36:07,100
Fish!

3119
02:36:08,180 --> 02:36:08,760
Fish!

3120
02:36:09,780 --> 02:36:10,500
Fish!

3121
02:36:12,260 --> 02:36:13,660
Speak!

3122
02:36:17,600 --> 02:36:19,000
Speak to me!

3123
02:36:27,730 --> 02:36:29,750
Why don't you speak?

3124
02:36:32,550 --> 02:36:33,530
Wow!

3125
02:36:33,670 --> 02:36:34,990
Okay, that's freaky.

3126
02:36:35,270 --> 02:36:36,410
Oh my God.

3127
02:36:36,850 --> 02:36:37,170
Hello?

3128
02:36:37,810 --> 02:36:38,190
Hello?

3129
02:36:39,250 --> 02:36:39,550
Hello?

3130
02:36:41,790 --> 02:36:43,990
Why don't you evolve?

3131
02:36:44,790 --> 02:36:45,770
Evolve!

3132
02:36:46,170 --> 02:36:52,470
E-V-O-L-V-E Just evolve.

3133
02:36:53,850 --> 02:36:54,410
Please!

3134
02:36:57,690 --> 02:37:01,070
I just want you to evolve.

3135
02:37:01,830 --> 02:37:03,470
Evolve!

3136
02:37:06,530 --> 02:37:08,470
Oh my God!

3137
02:37:09,230 --> 02:37:11,490
Why won't they evolve?

3138
02:37:13,790 --> 02:37:14,490
Why?

3139
02:37:19,910 --> 02:37:21,310
Evolve!

3140
02:37:22,150 --> 02:37:22,910
Speak!

3141
02:37:25,950 --> 02:37:26,550
Fish!

3142
02:37:27,430 --> 02:37:28,330
Fish!

3143
02:37:29,470 --> 02:37:30,430
Fish!

3144
02:37:36,500 --> 02:37:39,320
I'm holding the button!

3145
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:46,200
E-V-O-L-V-E Please!

3146
02:37:46,780 --> 02:37:48,100
Be calm down!

3147
02:37:48,440 --> 02:37:50,700
Please move out of my home!

3148
02:37:52,140 --> 02:37:53,120
Fish!

3149
02:37:56,260 --> 02:37:56,880
Please!

3150
02:37:58,540 --> 02:38:00,560
Become big!

3151
02:38:00,560 --> 02:38:00,640
Please!

3152
02:38:04,220 --> 02:38:06,180
Leave my home!

3153
02:38:15,480 --> 02:38:18,360
One of them will evolve, surely.

3154
02:38:21,420 --> 02:38:22,120
Surely.

3155
02:38:23,420 --> 02:38:24,120
Fish!

3156
02:38:25,300 --> 02:38:26,000
Fish!

3157
02:38:26,960 --> 02:38:27,580
Hello!

3158
02:38:29,200 --> 02:38:30,460
Hello, fish!

3159
02:38:30,920 --> 02:38:31,280
Hello!

3160
02:38:32,080 --> 02:38:32,580
Hello!

3161
02:38:35,760 --> 02:38:38,920
I was promised catabolism!

3162
02:38:39,200 --> 02:38:43,280
Why do I not get catabolism?

3163
02:38:49,720 --> 02:38:51,580
I'm so sad.

3164
02:38:52,580 --> 02:38:56,040
I'm so sad.

3165
02:38:59,450 --> 02:39:01,710
Why won't...

3166
02:39:04,630 --> 02:39:09,070
Why won't you catabolize each other?

3167
02:39:11,670 --> 02:39:13,070
Catabolism!

3168
02:39:13,530 --> 02:39:13,890
Eat!

3169
02:39:14,990 --> 02:39:15,770
Eat!

3170
02:39:17,630 --> 02:39:19,030
Eat!

3171
02:39:24,360 --> 02:39:26,890
I need them to eat each other!

3172
02:39:27,670 --> 02:39:29,850
I need you to evolve!

3173
02:39:30,590 --> 02:39:34,150
I don't want this filament anymore!

3174
02:39:35,310 --> 02:39:39,010
I can eat an egg goon if it makes you feel better.

3175
02:39:39,270 --> 02:39:40,850
It's not the same.

3176
02:39:41,250 --> 02:39:43,090
It's not the same.

3177
02:39:43,210 --> 02:39:43,930
Next scene.

3178
02:39:44,110 --> 02:39:46,050
Thank you for the super chat.

3179
02:39:46,270 --> 02:39:47,690
Thank you, thank you.

3180
02:39:48,830 --> 02:39:51,330
I don't understand!

3181
02:39:56,240 --> 02:39:58,060
I don't understand!

3182
02:40:03,320 --> 02:40:06,680
Why won't they eat each other?

3183
02:40:07,840 --> 02:40:09,940
I waited so long!

3184
02:40:10,060 --> 02:40:11,560
It's three days!

3185
02:40:12,720 --> 02:40:14,700
It's three days!

3186
02:40:15,860 --> 02:40:17,780
This batch of children!

3187
02:40:18,400 --> 02:40:20,940
There's something wrong with them!

3188
02:40:23,300 --> 02:40:24,380
Fish!

3189
02:40:25,680 --> 02:40:26,560
Fish!

3190
02:40:30,640 --> 02:40:33,560
There's something wrong with these kids!

3191
02:40:34,360 --> 02:40:36,320
They won't talk to me!

3192
02:40:36,780 --> 02:40:38,500
They won't eat each other!

3193
02:40:38,640 --> 02:40:40,140
They won't evolve!

3194
02:40:40,900 --> 02:40:42,940
We're at day four!

3195
02:40:46,480 --> 02:40:52,140
I was told they start eating each other at day three!

3196
02:40:52,880 --> 02:40:54,880
Why are they still here?

3197
02:40:55,560 --> 02:40:57,280
Why?

3198
02:41:02,700 --> 02:41:03,920
Eat!

3199
02:41:05,200 --> 02:41:06,040
Fish!

3200
02:41:07,100 --> 02:41:08,340
Fish!

3201
02:41:09,480 --> 02:41:10,500
Fish!

3202
02:41:11,580 --> 02:41:12,260
Fish!

3203
02:41:13,620 --> 02:41:15,500
Why are you still here like this?

3204
02:41:15,620 --> 02:41:16,040
Why?

3205
02:41:16,600 --> 02:41:17,140
Why?

3206
02:41:17,780 --> 02:41:19,100
Why?

3207
02:41:21,260 --> 02:41:23,460
I don't understand.

3208
02:41:25,560 --> 02:41:27,800
How are you still here like this?

3209
02:41:27,960 --> 02:41:28,420
Why?

3210
02:41:30,680 --> 02:41:32,340
Why can't you...

3211
02:41:32,340 --> 02:41:33,780
Why can't you eat your siblings?

3212
02:41:34,280 --> 02:41:36,240
That's all I wanted from you.

3213
02:41:37,700 --> 02:41:39,180
That's all I wanted.

3214
02:41:39,740 --> 02:41:41,640
I want you to eat your siblings.

3215
02:41:44,520 --> 02:41:45,200
Eat!

3216
02:41:52,400 --> 02:41:53,760
Is that...

3217
02:41:53,760 --> 02:41:54,700
Okay.

3218
02:41:56,180 --> 02:41:57,600
Okay, I got an idea.

3219
02:41:59,640 --> 02:42:00,240
Okay.

3220
02:42:01,600 --> 02:42:03,120
I got an idea.

3221
02:42:03,800 --> 02:42:04,220
Guys.

3222
02:42:05,900 --> 02:42:07,620
Guys, I got an idea.

3223
02:42:08,640 --> 02:42:09,160
Guys.

3224
02:42:09,480 --> 02:42:10,700
I figured it out.

3225
02:42:11,460 --> 02:42:13,240
Okay, we gotta remember the date.

3226
02:42:13,820 --> 02:42:15,200
I figured it out.

3227
02:42:15,560 --> 02:42:16,740
Okay, it's...

3228
02:42:16,740 --> 02:42:17,440
Look at this.

3229
02:42:17,900 --> 02:42:19,220
Okay, I gotta save this.

3230
02:42:19,760 --> 02:42:21,660
I figured it out, guys.

3231
02:42:22,740 --> 02:42:23,880
I figured it out.

3232
02:42:24,880 --> 02:42:26,660
I know what to do.

3233
02:42:30,400 --> 02:42:32,760
I know what to do.

3234
02:42:35,700 --> 02:42:37,740
I know what to do.

3235
02:42:41,120 --> 02:42:43,720
I will make sure it works.

3236
02:42:45,260 --> 02:42:47,020
I will make sure...

3237
02:42:47,780 --> 02:42:51,380
I will make sure this works.

3238
02:42:53,700 --> 02:42:54,660
Okay.

3239
02:43:01,230 --> 02:43:02,650
This is it.

3240
02:43:03,310 --> 02:43:05,990
This is my Hail Mary.

3241
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:14,230
This is...

3242
02:43:18,940 --> 02:43:20,710
This is my Hail Mary.

3243
02:43:23,250 --> 02:43:24,590
Come on.

3244
02:43:25,810 --> 02:43:27,450
What the fuck?

3245
02:43:29,900 --> 02:43:30,390
Okay.

3246
02:43:31,250 --> 02:43:32,450
I'm changing the date.

3247
02:43:32,450 --> 02:43:34,490
I have the date.

3248
02:43:35,170 --> 02:43:36,010
Alright.

3249
02:43:37,770 --> 02:43:40,910
I'm going back to time traveling again.

3250
02:43:41,910 --> 02:43:44,210
I'm coming back a couple of days...

3251
02:43:44,210 --> 02:43:45,210
Okay, let's see.

3252
02:43:45,390 --> 02:43:46,330
Just an hour...

3253
02:43:46,330 --> 02:43:47,370
Two hours later.

3254
02:43:48,410 --> 02:43:48,850
Okay.

3255
02:43:49,370 --> 02:43:51,430
And then...

3256
02:43:51,430 --> 02:43:53,070
They will talk to me.

3257
02:43:53,790 --> 02:43:56,130
They will talk to me.

3258
02:43:56,950 --> 02:43:59,790
They will talk to me, guys.

3259
02:43:59,790 --> 02:44:03,250
They absolutely will talk to me.

3260
02:44:07,330 --> 02:44:10,530
Guys, what's the button to make this full screen again?

3261
02:44:10,590 --> 02:44:11,370
I don't remember.

3262
02:44:13,890 --> 02:44:15,910
Okay, it's very tiny, guys.

3263
02:44:16,930 --> 02:44:17,530
Because...

3264
02:44:17,530 --> 02:44:19,870
I need to see if they'll talk to me first.

3265
02:44:22,110 --> 02:44:22,710
Okay.

3266
02:44:25,710 --> 02:44:26,310
Okay.

3267
02:44:27,890 --> 02:44:28,950
Talk to me.

3268
02:44:31,150 --> 02:44:31,910
Children.

3269
02:44:36,480 --> 02:44:38,740
Okay, they will talk to me now.

3270
02:44:39,160 --> 02:44:41,300
I read the guide again.

3271
02:44:42,160 --> 02:44:44,000
I figured it out.

3272
02:44:44,700 --> 02:44:46,680
I figured it out.

3273
02:44:46,980 --> 02:44:49,200
The children shall talk to me.

3274
02:44:51,300 --> 02:44:52,760
Oh, I don't know what he said.

3275
02:44:52,860 --> 02:44:53,980
Oh, I don't know.

3276
02:44:54,720 --> 02:44:56,400
I just pressed start.

3277
02:44:56,680 --> 02:44:58,380
I don't care anymore.

3278
02:45:01,690 --> 02:45:02,450
Okay.

3279
02:45:04,150 --> 02:45:05,870
I'll give you guys a little bit of heat.

3280
02:45:06,110 --> 02:45:08,290
I don't know if you are starving or not.

3281
02:45:12,420 --> 02:45:12,880
Okay.

3282
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:14,760
I think...

3283
02:45:15,460 --> 02:45:16,320
Hello!

3284
02:45:17,440 --> 02:45:18,360
Hello!

3285
02:45:21,220 --> 02:45:22,140
Fish!

3286
02:45:23,680 --> 02:45:24,600
Fish!

3287
02:45:26,020 --> 02:45:26,940
Fish!

3288
02:45:29,600 --> 02:45:30,520
Fish!

3289
02:45:31,500 --> 02:45:32,420
Hello!

3290
02:45:32,420 --> 02:45:33,020
Hello!

3291
02:45:35,350 --> 02:45:37,680
Hello, you fucking shithead!

3292
02:45:38,620 --> 02:45:40,100
Talk to me!

3293
02:45:47,170 --> 02:45:49,340
Why won't you talk to me?

3294
02:45:50,190 --> 02:45:52,220
I don't understand.

3295
02:45:53,380 --> 02:45:56,900
Why won't you talk to me?

3296
02:45:58,220 --> 02:46:01,260
What do I have to do?

3297
02:46:02,780 --> 02:46:03,700
Please!

3298
02:46:04,780 --> 02:46:08,500
I just want you to talk to me!

3299
02:46:09,720 --> 02:46:12,720
Is that so much to ask for?

3300
02:46:26,240 --> 02:46:27,160
Okay.

3301
02:46:28,180 --> 02:46:29,480
Does anyone want to talk?

3302
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:30,300
Hello?

3303
02:46:31,260 --> 02:46:32,240
Hello?

3304
02:46:34,280 --> 02:46:36,580
Why are they all ignoring me?

3305
02:46:38,780 --> 02:46:39,340
Wait.

3306
02:46:41,300 --> 02:46:43,720
They are all ignoring me.

3307
02:46:49,650 --> 02:46:51,370
Except for you.

3308
02:46:51,850 --> 02:46:52,590
Except for you.

3309
02:46:53,410 --> 02:46:53,810
Hello!

3310
02:46:55,890 --> 02:46:57,050
Fish!

3311
02:46:58,230 --> 02:46:58,870
Fish?

3312
02:47:00,210 --> 02:47:00,790
Speak!

3313
02:47:02,050 --> 02:47:02,970
Speak!

3314
02:47:04,730 --> 02:47:06,130
Fishy fish!

3315
02:47:06,870 --> 02:47:07,790
Okay.

3316
02:47:45,640 --> 02:47:47,000
It's okay.

3317
02:47:50,310 --> 02:47:51,630
It's okay.

3318
02:47:55,350 --> 02:47:57,410
Everything is fine.

3319
02:48:02,530 --> 02:48:05,990
Everything is fine.

3320
02:48:11,980 --> 02:48:13,420
It's the A button, right?

3321
02:48:13,960 --> 02:48:16,040
It's the A button, right?

3322
02:48:16,640 --> 02:48:17,220
It's the A button, right?

3323
02:48:17,240 --> 02:48:21,880
It's the A button, right guys?

3324
02:48:23,760 --> 02:48:26,040
To talk to my fishies?

3325
02:48:32,270 --> 02:48:33,830
I'm looking at the manual.

3326
02:48:34,870 --> 02:48:41,790
I just want them to talk to me.

3327
02:48:42,390 --> 02:48:44,350
I don't understand.

3328
02:48:47,850 --> 02:48:50,730
Why won't you talk to me?

3329
02:48:52,010 --> 02:48:53,770
I did so much.

3330
02:48:53,950 --> 02:48:55,550
I cared for them.

3331
02:49:06,380 --> 02:49:07,740
It's the A button.

3332
02:49:10,360 --> 02:49:12,520
It is the A button.

3333
02:49:13,840 --> 02:49:14,760
Was it?

3334
02:49:15,140 --> 02:49:16,220
My god.

3335
02:49:16,360 --> 02:49:17,640
It had to be, right?

3336
02:49:19,780 --> 02:49:21,140
There is...

3337
02:49:21,140 --> 02:49:21,640
Hello?

3338
02:49:23,240 --> 02:49:23,760
Hello?

3339
02:49:25,440 --> 02:49:25,640
Fish.

3340
02:49:26,540 --> 02:49:27,100
Fish.

3341
02:49:28,600 --> 02:49:28,980
Fish.

3342
02:49:30,660 --> 02:49:31,420
Fish.

3343
02:49:32,640 --> 02:49:33,020
Fish.

3344
02:49:35,260 --> 02:49:35,700
Fish.

3345
02:49:36,520 --> 02:49:36,920
Fish.

3346
02:49:37,460 --> 02:49:38,820
Fish fish fish.

3347
02:49:39,220 --> 02:49:39,900
Fish fish fish.

3348
02:49:40,440 --> 02:49:41,060
Fish fish fish.

3349
02:49:41,180 --> 02:49:41,760
Talk to me.

3350
02:49:42,140 --> 02:49:42,980
Talk to me.

3351
02:49:43,580 --> 02:49:44,880
You have to talk to me.

3352
02:49:45,180 --> 02:49:47,160
Talk to me or I'll kill you to death.

3353
02:49:47,160 --> 02:49:47,840
Fish.

3354
02:49:48,740 --> 02:49:49,680
Fish.

3355
02:49:50,280 --> 02:49:50,680
Eat!

3356
02:49:50,980 --> 02:49:51,460
Eat!

3357
02:49:51,720 --> 02:49:52,140
Please!

3358
02:49:52,300 --> 02:49:53,160
Eat your sisters!

3359
02:49:53,620 --> 02:49:54,740
Eat your brothers and sisters!

3360
02:49:55,080 --> 02:49:55,380
Please!

3361
02:49:55,820 --> 02:49:56,200
Eat!

3362
02:49:56,920 --> 02:49:57,400
Eat!

3363
02:49:57,820 --> 02:49:59,640
Just eat them!

3364
02:50:05,150 --> 02:50:07,210
Why won't they eat?

3365
02:50:08,150 --> 02:50:10,730
Why won't they eat?

3366
02:50:15,230 --> 02:50:17,110
I just...

3367
02:50:17,670 --> 02:50:20,970
I just need them to eat.

3368
02:50:21,150 --> 02:50:23,090
That's it.

3369
02:50:27,010 --> 02:50:27,690
Okay.

3370
02:50:28,230 --> 02:50:29,070
Okay.

3371
02:50:29,430 --> 02:50:30,130
Okay.

3372
02:50:30,550 --> 02:50:31,770
I got this.

3373
02:50:33,190 --> 02:50:34,990
I tapped the glass twice.

3374
02:50:38,710 --> 02:50:40,010
Eat!

3375
02:50:47,450 --> 02:50:48,190
Fish!

3376
02:50:53,840 --> 02:50:54,860
Speak!

3377
02:51:01,130 --> 02:51:01,830
Hello?

3378
02:51:08,430 --> 02:51:09,510
Hi!

3379
02:51:18,890 --> 02:51:24,090
I took care of them for so long.

3380
02:51:25,170 --> 02:51:27,870
But they're still kids.

3381
02:51:28,850 --> 02:51:31,530
They're still kids!

3382
02:51:32,930 --> 02:51:35,590
Why are they still kids?

3383
02:51:36,050 --> 02:51:39,830
Why can't they just eat each other?

3384
02:51:41,070 --> 02:51:42,750
Eat each other!

3385
02:51:46,630 --> 02:51:47,830
Eat!

3386
02:51:50,490 --> 02:51:51,690
Eat!

3387
02:51:52,830 --> 02:51:53,370
Hello?

3388
02:52:01,750 --> 02:52:03,530
I can't...

3389
02:52:03,530 --> 02:52:04,690
I can't...

3390
02:52:04,730 --> 02:52:07,490
I can't kill these fucking fish.

3391
02:52:08,370 --> 02:52:10,730
I just want them...

3392
02:52:11,490 --> 02:52:13,890
I just want them to evolve.

3393
02:52:14,690 --> 02:52:16,450
Why can't you evolve?

3394
02:52:17,330 --> 02:52:18,990
That's all I want!

3395
02:52:21,170 --> 02:52:23,730
I just want them to evolve.

3396
02:52:25,450 --> 02:52:27,510
I don't understand.

3397
02:52:28,830 --> 02:52:30,270
Why you don't...

3398
02:52:30,270 --> 02:52:31,950
Why you don't evolve?

3399
02:52:38,550 --> 02:52:39,490
Eat!

3400
02:52:41,930 --> 02:52:42,970
Hello?

3401
02:52:46,760 --> 02:52:47,920
Fish!

3402
02:52:49,340 --> 02:52:54,440
Oh my god.

3403
02:52:55,420 --> 02:52:56,680
It doesn't...

3404
02:52:57,540 --> 02:52:58,840
They don't evolve.

3405
02:53:00,020 --> 02:53:01,680
They said they evolve...

3406
02:53:02,500 --> 02:53:03,720
in three days.

3407
02:53:04,320 --> 02:53:07,020
It's been longer than three days.

3408
02:53:07,380 --> 02:53:09,620
How are they still here?

3409
02:53:13,680 --> 02:53:16,640
How are you still here?

3410
02:53:17,660 --> 02:53:21,020
You're supposed to be evolved now.

3411
02:53:26,630 --> 02:53:28,830
I don't understand.

3412
02:53:31,790 --> 02:53:33,830
Why are you here?

3413
02:53:42,110 --> 02:53:43,510
A week?

3414
02:53:43,770 --> 02:53:45,770
I was told three days.

3415
02:53:45,770 --> 02:53:49,710
And you're telling me there's still gonna be little fishies?

3416
02:53:49,850 --> 02:53:51,670
After three days?

3417
02:53:53,330 --> 02:53:56,390
I can't believe I was lied to.

3418
02:53:56,930 --> 02:54:01,490
You all said three days and I believed you.

3419
02:54:04,590 --> 02:54:06,750
It's actually...

3420
02:54:06,750 --> 02:54:09,670
Oh my god!

3421
02:54:10,890 --> 02:54:12,870
Goodbye, fishies.

3422
02:54:13,870 --> 02:54:15,070
Goodbye.

3423
02:54:18,870 --> 02:54:22,790
And they take a few weeks to evolve?

3424
02:54:23,090 --> 02:54:23,770
Fish.

3425
02:54:28,570 --> 02:54:29,170
Hello.

3426
02:54:32,920 --> 02:54:33,890
Fuck you.

3427
02:54:34,470 --> 02:54:35,350
Fuck you.

3428
02:54:38,120 --> 02:54:39,410
Fuck you.

3429
02:54:42,180 --> 02:54:42,810
Hello.

3430
02:54:45,630 --> 02:54:46,450
Fish!

3431
02:54:47,510 --> 02:54:48,770
I hate them.

3432
02:54:48,870 --> 02:54:49,830
I hate my children.

3433
02:54:50,130 --> 02:54:51,330
I hate them.

3434
02:54:51,450 --> 02:54:53,870
I hate them so much.

3435
02:54:54,410 --> 02:55:06,490
Oh my god.

3436
02:55:07,850 --> 02:55:10,550
Why won't you do any...

3437
02:55:18,510 --> 02:55:19,670
Why?

3438
02:55:20,650 --> 02:55:22,110
Okay, I'm gonna...

3439
02:55:22,110 --> 02:55:22,110
wait.

3440
02:55:22,930 --> 02:55:24,790
Select microphone.

3441
02:55:29,570 --> 02:55:31,850
Okay, I...

3442
02:55:32,610 --> 02:55:34,010
Okay.

3443
02:55:34,810 --> 02:55:36,390
It's fine.

3444
02:55:37,830 --> 02:55:40,570
I'm looking... I'm reading something real quick.

3445
02:55:41,130 --> 02:55:43,110
I'm reading something.

3446
02:55:44,850 --> 02:55:47,190
I'm reading something.

3447
02:55:49,240 --> 02:55:51,310
That might fix it.

3448
02:55:56,220 --> 02:55:59,710
I'm reading something real quick.

3449
02:56:06,380 --> 02:56:07,290
It's okay.

3450
02:56:09,380 --> 02:56:10,350
It's okay.

3451
02:56:12,380 --> 02:56:13,810
I can do this.

3452
02:56:14,430 --> 02:56:14,750
I can.

3453
02:56:14,970 --> 02:56:15,410
I can.

3454
02:56:16,390 --> 02:56:17,930
It's okay.

3455
02:56:19,650 --> 02:56:21,430
I can do this.

3456
02:56:27,670 --> 02:56:29,350
I can do this.

3457
02:56:29,930 --> 02:56:32,170
I will make my fish listen to me.

3458
02:56:32,450 --> 02:56:34,750
I love my fish.

3459
02:56:35,650 --> 02:56:38,330
My fish is gonna listen to me.

3460
02:56:39,570 --> 02:56:42,490
One of them is gonna listen to me.

3461
02:56:43,670 --> 02:56:43,990
Hello!

3462
02:56:47,550 --> 02:56:48,390
Hello!

3463
02:56:50,130 --> 02:56:50,970
Hello!

3464
02:56:52,350 --> 02:56:52,730
Hello!

3465
02:56:55,490 --> 02:56:56,510
Hello!

3466
02:56:59,190 --> 02:57:00,210
Fish!

3467
02:57:00,810 --> 02:57:01,830
Fish!

3468
02:57:04,720 --> 02:57:05,940
I'm killing them.

3469
02:57:24,660 --> 02:57:26,300
I've had enough.

3470
02:57:26,760 --> 02:57:28,580
I'm at my breaking point.

3471
02:57:30,520 --> 02:57:33,360
I'm at my breaking point.

3472
02:57:36,160 --> 02:57:37,800
I'm done.

3473
02:57:38,360 --> 02:57:39,260
I'm done.

3474
02:57:39,820 --> 02:57:42,020
Don't keep releasing them.

3475
02:57:42,660 --> 02:57:44,660
I'm fucking done.

3476
02:57:45,680 --> 02:57:46,600
I can't.

3477
02:57:46,700 --> 02:57:48,080
I can't.

3478
02:57:48,200 --> 02:57:52,080
I can't keep doing it.

3479
02:57:53,080 --> 02:57:54,260
I...

3480
02:57:56,640 --> 02:57:59,220
Guys, I can't.

3481
02:58:00,060 --> 02:58:01,940
I'm not strong enough.

3482
02:58:03,500 --> 02:58:04,880
I'm not.

3483
02:58:05,020 --> 02:58:07,900
I'm not strong enough.

3484
02:58:16,230 --> 02:58:19,130
Okay, I'll do one more.

3485
02:58:19,670 --> 02:58:20,710
I'll...

3486
02:58:20,710 --> 02:58:21,550
I'll...

3487
02:58:23,440 --> 02:58:27,790
I'll do one more thing before I kill them.

3488
02:58:30,660 --> 02:58:35,930
This is the last thing I'll do before these fishes die.

3489
02:58:41,480 --> 02:58:43,710
This is the...

3490
02:58:45,430 --> 02:58:51,630
This is the last thing I'll do before I kill them.

3491
02:58:52,210 --> 02:58:54,950
I'm just not strong enough.

3492
02:58:55,230 --> 02:58:57,350
Guys, I'm not.

3493
02:58:57,850 --> 02:58:59,470
I can't.

3494
02:58:59,950 --> 02:59:01,110
I can't.

3495
02:59:01,270 --> 02:59:04,930
Guys, I'm not strong enough.

3496
02:59:07,530 --> 02:59:09,110
I can't.

3497
02:59:10,070 --> 02:59:11,110
Okay.

3498
02:59:12,110 --> 02:59:13,110
Okay.

3499
02:59:14,050 --> 02:59:16,170
This is my final attempt.

3500
02:59:16,810 --> 02:59:19,090
Just one more day.

3501
02:59:19,650 --> 02:59:27,090
I don't have no more one more day.

3502
02:59:28,110 --> 02:59:28,950
Guys.

3503
02:59:30,250 --> 02:59:32,270
I don't think you understand.

3504
02:59:33,130 --> 02:59:37,210
I don't have another day to give anymore.

3505
02:59:37,210 --> 02:59:42,910
I don't think I have another day to give.

3506
02:59:43,350 --> 02:59:45,650
I'm not strong enough.

3507
02:59:47,950 --> 02:59:48,710
Okay.

3508
02:59:49,250 --> 02:59:50,270
Four.

3509
02:59:52,930 --> 02:59:54,130
Nine.

3510
02:59:55,790 --> 02:59:56,990
Six.

3511
02:59:58,290 --> 02:59:59,970
Alright, that's a fine time.

3512
03:00:00,670 --> 03:00:01,130
Okay.

3513
03:00:03,350 --> 03:00:04,550
Alright.

3514
03:00:05,610 --> 03:00:08,410
Yes, I tried to read the mic.

3515
03:00:09,170 --> 03:00:12,350
And the mic is just not working.

3516
03:00:13,250 --> 03:00:18,010
I thought I got the mic to work, but it's not picking up my mic.

3517
03:00:21,720 --> 03:00:22,400
Okay.

3518
03:00:26,790 --> 03:00:28,350
I'll give him one more day.

3519
03:00:28,510 --> 03:00:30,690
I'll give them one more day.

3520
03:00:31,230 --> 03:00:35,690
But if those fishes do not evolve...

3521
03:00:35,690 --> 03:00:38,170
We're saying goodbye to these fishes.

3522
03:00:52,390 --> 03:00:54,430
There's still eight men.

3523
03:01:06,450 --> 03:01:08,850
That's nice to know.

3524
03:01:09,550 --> 03:01:11,470
That's nice to know.

3525
03:01:12,250 --> 03:01:15,110
That they're having a great day.

3526
03:01:15,790 --> 03:01:16,550
Wow.

3527
03:01:17,290 --> 03:01:19,430
I'm so happy for them.

3528
03:01:19,830 --> 03:01:23,770
That they're enjoying their time in this habitat.

3529
03:01:25,370 --> 03:01:26,530
Alright.

3530
03:01:28,490 --> 03:01:30,270
One last time.

3531
03:01:30,910 --> 03:01:32,550
One last ride.

3532
03:01:32,550 --> 03:01:36,550
I should give them one more day after that.

3533
03:01:36,790 --> 03:01:38,970
Get over here, little sea man.

3534
03:01:40,850 --> 03:01:42,690
Get over here.

3535
03:01:43,350 --> 03:01:45,850
I need to talk to you.

3536
03:01:46,870 --> 03:01:47,630
Come on.

3537
03:01:48,910 --> 03:01:49,930
Come on.

3538
03:01:52,170 --> 03:01:53,690
Come on, swim over.

3539
03:01:57,010 --> 03:01:57,890
Fish.

3540
03:02:01,830 --> 03:02:02,490
Hello.

3541
03:02:06,920 --> 03:02:07,980
It's over.

3542
03:02:08,280 --> 03:02:09,780
Say goodbye to all of them.

3543
03:02:10,580 --> 03:02:11,840
Say goodbye.

3544
03:02:21,370 --> 03:02:25,410
Say goodbye to all of them.

3545
03:02:26,390 --> 03:02:28,130
It's over.

3546
03:02:29,370 --> 03:02:30,530
Hello.

3547
03:02:33,730 --> 03:02:34,890
Hi.

3548
03:02:38,240 --> 03:02:40,300
It's over for them.

3549
03:02:40,560 --> 03:02:42,200
They don't know it yet.

3550
03:02:42,400 --> 03:02:44,040
But I do.

3551
03:02:45,180 --> 03:02:46,700
I know it.

3552
03:02:47,320 --> 03:02:49,380
I know it's over.

3553
03:02:50,020 --> 03:03:02,630
I know it's gone.

3554
03:03:09,230 --> 03:03:11,010
We did it.

3555
03:03:15,430 --> 03:03:16,370
Okay,

3556
03:03:20,130 --> 03:03:21,450
I didn't...

3557
03:03:21,450 --> 03:03:22,030
Okay.

3558
03:03:27,270 --> 03:03:30,410
I know it's over for these fishes.

3559
03:03:31,830 --> 03:03:34,390
It's over for all of them.

3560
03:03:35,030 --> 03:03:37,350
They've done their best.

3561
03:03:39,670 --> 03:03:40,350
Hello.

3562
03:03:43,270 --> 03:03:44,310
It's over.

3563
03:03:45,330 --> 03:03:46,330
It's over.

3564
03:03:46,930 --> 03:03:48,390
I'll give them one more day.

3565
03:03:49,530 --> 03:03:52,130
And then it's off to two years.

3566
03:03:52,230 --> 03:03:54,330
And then we're going to next year.

3567
03:03:54,330 --> 03:03:57,250
I gave them a chest.

3568
03:04:02,290 --> 03:04:04,810
The last day before their...

3569
03:04:04,810 --> 03:04:05,850
The final...

3570
03:04:05,850 --> 03:04:08,610
The last supper before they...

3571
03:04:08,610 --> 03:04:10,270
Before they die.

3572
03:04:11,130 --> 03:04:13,090
I'll even give them...

3573
03:04:13,090 --> 03:04:15,530
I'll even give them a little treat.

3574
03:04:16,190 --> 03:04:20,150
I'll even give them a little treat before they die.

3575
03:04:20,770 --> 03:04:23,010
A final supper, guys.

3576
03:04:25,250 --> 03:04:27,730
Dawn of the final day.

3577
03:04:30,890 --> 03:04:34,230
Because I feel so compassionate.

3578
03:04:38,680 --> 03:04:40,680
Oh no, I know how they talk.

3579
03:04:41,680 --> 03:04:44,200
They just refuse to talk to me.

3580
03:04:49,700 --> 03:04:51,760
Oh my god.

3581
03:04:53,880 --> 03:04:55,180
That's fine.

3582
03:04:55,850 --> 03:04:56,920
They're fine.

3583
03:05:00,070 --> 03:05:01,280
They're okay.

3584
03:05:03,170 --> 03:05:04,380
They're okay.

3585
03:05:09,010 --> 03:05:10,220
They're okay.

3586
03:05:12,180 --> 03:05:13,120
Look, see?

3587
03:05:13,460 --> 03:05:15,440
Look how okay they are.

3588
03:05:15,440 --> 03:05:16,020
Look at that.

3589
03:05:18,230 --> 03:05:21,180
Not even gonna try to put it at...

3590
03:05:21,180 --> 03:05:24,260
I'm not even gonna try to put it out at 19.

3591
03:05:26,940 --> 03:05:29,980
From mother to executioner.

3592
03:05:35,180 --> 03:05:38,900
That's enough air for... That's enough air for all of you.

3593
03:05:40,640 --> 03:05:42,420
You refuse to evolve.

3594
03:05:43,860 --> 03:05:50,600
So I... If you refuse to grow up and pay rent, it's goodbye for all of you.

3595
03:05:53,080 --> 03:05:55,720
Oh, you don't even wanna get near the glass?

3596
03:05:56,020 --> 03:05:58,880
Get near the glass right now, kids!

3597
03:05:59,220 --> 03:06:00,280
Get in here!

3598
03:06:01,140 --> 03:06:03,500
Oh my god, they don't even...

3599
03:06:03,500 --> 03:06:05,420
They don't even...

3600
03:06:06,940 --> 03:06:09,240
They don't even listen to me anymore.

3601
03:06:10,780 --> 03:06:11,420
They...

3602
03:06:14,210 --> 03:06:16,610
They don't even listen to me.

3603
03:06:22,170 --> 03:06:24,730
They're not even looking at me.

3604
03:06:28,110 --> 03:06:29,930
Why don't you look at me?

3605
03:06:31,930 --> 03:06:34,550
They don't even look at me anymore.

3606
03:06:35,050 --> 03:06:35,970
I'll pick you up.

3607
03:06:36,090 --> 03:06:37,710
Can I kill them if I pick them up?

3608
03:06:42,710 --> 03:06:43,310
Suffocate.

3609
03:06:49,930 --> 03:06:53,590
Can you die from lack of water?

3610
03:06:54,830 --> 03:06:56,130
Is that possible?

3611
03:06:58,550 --> 03:07:00,830
Is that actually possible?

3612
03:07:07,810 --> 03:07:13,050
Is it possible to just not be able to breathe?

3613
03:07:13,850 --> 03:07:15,510
They don't even look at me.

3614
03:07:15,610 --> 03:07:16,050
Look at...

3615
03:07:16,050 --> 03:07:17,990
Except for this guy, this was my favorite.

3616
03:07:19,350 --> 03:07:19,870
Hello!

3617
03:07:20,610 --> 03:07:22,130
Are you fucking... okay.

3618
03:07:28,410 --> 03:07:30,250
Okay, now you look at me.

3619
03:07:30,290 --> 03:07:30,510
Okay.

3620
03:07:32,190 --> 03:07:33,050
Okay, wait, wait.

3621
03:07:34,450 --> 03:07:35,490
Okay, there you go.

3622
03:07:35,550 --> 03:07:35,770
Okay.

3623
03:07:36,950 --> 03:07:37,470
Hello!

3624
03:07:40,950 --> 03:07:41,470
Fish!

3625
03:07:43,910 --> 03:07:44,430
Fish!

3626
03:07:46,050 --> 03:07:46,690
Fish!

3627
03:07:49,580 --> 03:07:50,930
I'm gonna kill them.

3628
03:07:55,620 --> 03:07:56,770
It's time.

3629
03:08:06,380 --> 03:08:07,920
It's time.

3630
03:08:10,960 --> 03:08:13,580
The verdict has been delivered.

3631
03:08:20,560 --> 03:08:21,800
It's time.

3632
03:08:23,560 --> 03:08:25,380
I have decided their fate.

3633
03:08:25,580 --> 03:08:28,820
I have decided...

3634
03:08:28,820 --> 03:08:30,180
I have...

3635
03:08:30,180 --> 03:08:35,580
I have decided their fate.

3636
03:08:39,920 --> 03:08:41,120
Oh no.

3637
03:08:46,180 --> 03:08:49,040
Oh no, how could this have happened?

3638
03:08:50,140 --> 03:08:51,740
Who would have thought?

3639
03:08:55,340 --> 03:08:56,820
Alright, where's the air?

3640
03:09:00,820 --> 03:09:02,240
I need to see this.

3641
03:09:06,190 --> 03:09:07,670
Where are their bodies?

3642
03:09:09,910 --> 03:09:13,030
Do I even get to see where their bodies...

3643
03:09:17,130 --> 03:09:20,910
Do I... do I even... do I get to see where they died?

3644
03:09:24,970 --> 03:09:25,930
Alright, thirty...

3645
03:09:26,750 --> 03:09:28,990
Thirty-four...

3646
03:09:34,850 --> 03:09:36,850
Forty-five...

3647
03:09:36,850 --> 03:09:38,670
Where were their bodies at?

3648
03:09:39,250 --> 03:09:40,870
Oh, it's just empty.

3649
03:09:46,090 --> 03:09:49,410
It's just... it's just empty.

3650
03:09:49,790 --> 03:09:52,190
It's like they were never there.

3651
03:09:53,090 --> 03:09:53,590
Hello?

3652
03:09:54,370 --> 03:09:56,090
Oh, there they are.

3653
03:09:59,410 --> 03:10:00,050
Fuck!

3654
03:10:00,670 --> 03:10:06,130
Oh my god, there they are!

3655
03:10:09,090 --> 03:10:10,170
Oh shit!

3656
03:10:11,150 --> 03:10:12,610
Oh my god!

3657
03:10:13,170 --> 03:10:14,870
Oh my god, there they are!

3658
03:10:15,570 --> 03:10:16,750
Oh my god!

3659
03:10:21,250 --> 03:10:23,290
We can't pick them up?

3660
03:10:26,880 --> 03:10:27,840
Oh, they're doing...

3661
03:10:27,840 --> 03:10:29,100
Tickle, tickle!

3662
03:10:29,380 --> 03:10:30,220
Tickle!

3663
03:10:31,940 --> 03:10:33,600
Tickle, tickle!

3664
03:10:37,890 --> 03:10:39,390
Tickle, tickle!

3665
03:10:39,610 --> 03:10:40,650
Come on, laugh!

3666
03:10:41,210 --> 03:10:42,390
Or are you just pretending?

3667
03:10:45,410 --> 03:10:46,910
Oh my god!

3668
03:10:48,830 --> 03:10:51,470
They won't let me pick them up, I don't know why!

3669
03:10:53,890 --> 03:10:55,630
Oh my god!

3670
03:10:58,670 --> 03:10:59,370
Hello!

3671
03:10:59,370 --> 03:11:00,030
Hello!

3672
03:11:01,370 --> 03:11:02,230
Fish!

3673
03:11:07,450 --> 03:11:08,310
Hello!

3674
03:11:13,290 --> 03:11:14,150
Fish!

3675
03:11:19,860 --> 03:11:21,320
Oh yeah, I got an idea!

3676
03:11:22,200 --> 03:11:23,660
Food time!

3677
03:11:24,600 --> 03:11:25,800
Hey guys, there's food!

3678
03:11:26,440 --> 03:11:27,100
Hey guys!

3679
03:11:27,760 --> 03:11:29,140
Guys, come over here!

3680
03:11:30,020 --> 03:11:30,980
There's food!

3681
03:11:31,020 --> 03:11:32,100
Oh my god!

3682
03:11:37,940 --> 03:11:38,960
Guys, there's food!

3683
03:11:39,880 --> 03:11:42,060
Oh my god!

3684
03:11:42,940 --> 03:11:44,640
Oh my god!

3685
03:11:45,840 --> 03:11:48,000
Guys, speak English!

3686
03:11:49,120 --> 03:11:49,540
Guys!

3687
03:11:50,200 --> 03:11:51,000
Oh my god!

3688
03:11:51,660 --> 03:11:54,720
Oh shit!

3689
03:11:56,740 --> 03:11:59,640
The accident was five years ago!

3690
03:11:59,640 --> 03:12:01,960
The sea matter did it!

3691
03:12:02,120 --> 03:12:03,960
It was absolutely your fault!

3692
03:12:04,740 --> 03:12:06,560
Thank you for the super chat!

3693
03:12:06,820 --> 03:12:08,180
Thank you, thank you Liam!

3694
03:12:08,480 --> 03:12:10,920
They never ate each other!

3695
03:12:11,900 --> 03:12:14,540
They never ate each other!

3696
03:12:14,640 --> 03:12:16,120
It's all I wanted!

3697
03:12:16,580 --> 03:12:18,580
Oh, and they're floating down!

3698
03:12:19,980 --> 03:12:21,620
They're floating down!

3699
03:12:22,180 --> 03:12:24,280
They're floating down!

3700
03:12:24,860 --> 03:12:27,560
Oh my god, why are they floating down?

3701
03:12:27,560 --> 03:12:29,540
Oh my god!

3702
03:12:29,920 --> 03:12:31,780
Why are they floating down?

3703
03:12:32,480 --> 03:12:36,400
Holy shit!

3704
03:12:40,970 --> 03:12:42,210
Oh my god!

3705
03:12:43,370 --> 03:12:44,430
Oh my god!

3706
03:12:45,430 --> 03:12:45,930
It's okay!

3707
03:12:46,950 --> 03:12:48,010
Tickle, tickle!

3708
03:12:49,530 --> 03:12:51,430
Tickle, tickle!

3709
03:12:52,210 --> 03:12:52,970
Hello!

3710
03:12:53,730 --> 03:12:55,150
Please laugh!

3711
03:12:56,210 --> 03:12:56,890
Please laugh!

3712
03:12:56,890 --> 03:12:58,070
Oh shit!

3713
03:12:58,670 --> 03:12:59,870
Oh my god!

3714
03:13:00,350 --> 03:13:02,330
His eyes opened!

3715
03:13:04,250 --> 03:13:04,950
Hello!

3716
03:13:06,510 --> 03:13:07,210
Hello!

3717
03:13:08,690 --> 03:13:10,690
Holy fuck!

3718
03:13:12,750 --> 03:13:13,870
Stop!

3719
03:13:15,110 --> 03:13:17,350
It's really fucked up!

3720
03:13:20,410 --> 03:13:21,110
Okay!

3721
03:13:22,410 --> 03:13:25,270
They never got to talk!

3722
03:13:26,890 --> 03:13:28,610
How unfortunate!

3723
03:13:29,470 --> 03:13:32,110
They never learned how to talk!

3724
03:13:36,790 --> 03:13:38,810
Oh, very unfortunate!

3725
03:13:39,310 --> 03:13:42,010
I tried my best, guys!

3726
03:13:42,450 --> 03:13:44,410
And they never will!

3727
03:13:45,470 --> 03:13:48,190
And they never will!

3728
03:13:51,750 --> 03:13:56,550
Maybe one day, I'll get the microphone working again!

3729
03:13:56,550 --> 03:14:00,010
And then we'll have to talk with them again!

3730
03:14:00,470 --> 03:14:01,910
Another time!

3731
03:14:09,190 --> 03:14:11,770
But we tried our best!

3732
03:14:12,490 --> 03:14:14,810
We tried our best!

3733
03:14:15,490 --> 03:14:19,570
Maybe one day, they'll talk to us!

3734
03:14:19,930 --> 03:14:21,810
Tarkus, thank you for the superchat!

3735
03:14:21,950 --> 03:14:23,170
Thank you, thank you!

3736
03:14:25,470 --> 03:14:26,970
Thank you, everybody!

3737
03:14:27,270 --> 03:14:28,330
They look so happy!

3738
03:14:28,670 --> 03:14:30,730
They look so happy now, like sleeping!

3739
03:14:31,070 --> 03:14:31,770
They're sleeping!

3740
03:14:33,090 --> 03:14:35,110
Everyone, they're just sleeping!

3741
03:14:36,090 --> 03:14:38,650
I hope you guys still enjoyed the stream!

3742
03:14:38,750 --> 03:14:42,950
Even though it was pretty scuffed, because I could never get them to talk to me!

3743
03:14:43,130 --> 03:14:45,310
Because I just picked the microphone!

3744
03:14:45,690 --> 03:14:47,590
It just never worked in the end!

3745
03:14:47,830 --> 03:14:52,130
But I hope you guys still had a great time watching!

3746
03:14:52,130 --> 03:14:52,390
Thank you!

3747
03:14:56,530 --> 03:14:59,410
What a journey today we had!

3748
03:15:00,710 --> 03:15:06,690
What a fun journey we had with our little semen right here!

3749
03:15:08,830 --> 03:15:10,530
Our little Gilmen!

3750
03:15:11,870 --> 03:15:13,590
Crossfire, thank you for the superchat!

3751
03:15:13,730 --> 03:15:14,430
Thank you, thank you!

3752
03:15:14,730 --> 03:15:16,210
Tarkus, thank you for the superchat!

3753
03:15:16,350 --> 03:15:17,250
Thank you, thank you!

3754
03:15:17,770 --> 03:15:19,230
Medi, thank you for the superchat!

3755
03:15:19,350 --> 03:15:20,010
Thank you, thank you!

3756
03:15:20,010 --> 03:15:22,010
They're descending to hell!

3757
03:15:22,630 --> 03:15:24,110
Thank you for the superchat!

3758
03:15:24,270 --> 03:15:25,630
Thank you, thank you!

3759
03:15:27,130 --> 03:15:28,150
Hey guys!

3760
03:15:29,990 --> 03:15:31,530
MrBrokenPawn, thank you for the superchat!

3761
03:15:31,630 --> 03:15:32,270
Thank you, thank you!

3762
03:15:32,470 --> 03:15:34,470
Let's just all forget what happened here today!

3763
03:15:36,790 --> 03:15:38,990
Guys, I have an idea!

3764
03:15:39,290 --> 03:15:41,110
Wait, wait, guys!

3765
03:15:41,890 --> 03:15:43,450
Guys, I have an idea!

3766
03:15:43,450 --> 03:15:43,470
Guys, I have an idea!

3767
03:15:45,470 --> 03:15:46,450
Guys, I have an idea!

3768
03:15:46,470 --> 03:15:49,810
It never happened!

3769
03:15:56,420 --> 03:15:57,980
It never happened!

3770
03:16:03,880 --> 03:16:06,820
As always, I'm going to head off now.

3771
03:16:07,080 --> 03:16:10,080
I might do a Rivals ring stream tonight, I don't know how I feel.

3772
03:16:10,420 --> 03:16:11,840
I'll see how my voice feels later.

3773
03:16:11,840 --> 03:16:15,300
But, delete the evidence.

3774
03:16:15,520 --> 03:16:16,920
It never happened, guys.

3775
03:16:17,420 --> 03:16:18,560
They never existed!

3776
03:16:19,320 --> 03:16:21,660
The Killman never existed!

3777
03:16:22,400 --> 03:16:25,880
Anyway guys, as always everybody, stay hydrated.

3778
03:16:26,500 --> 03:16:27,420
Posture check.

3779
03:16:27,880 --> 03:16:30,740
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3780
03:16:31,180 --> 03:16:33,960
And if you, except for me, head to bed.

3781
03:16:34,220 --> 03:16:36,080
Cause, you deserve it.

3782
03:16:36,340 --> 03:16:38,120
I'll see you guys next time everybody!

3783
03:16:38,600 --> 03:16:39,760
Bye guys!

3784
03:16:39,760 --> 03:16:41,020
Bye!
