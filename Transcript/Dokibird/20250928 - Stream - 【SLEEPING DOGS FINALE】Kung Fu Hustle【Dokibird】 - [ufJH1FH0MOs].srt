3
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:53,470
Today, I was so tired post Daft Punk concert.

00:03:54,450 --> 00:04:00,970
Like I had a, I had like an energy crash right after, you know.

5
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:06,230
Because not Daft, I was right, I was tired before.

6
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:22,710
The event and I used up all my energy during the event that was like actual like Like force shut down Like I was like zero percent battery and I like took a nap and I was when I woke up when I woke up from my time I was like

7
00:04:26,690 --> 00:05:09,840

8
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:20,780

9
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:36,480
The mom voice in my head like this is why because I still because we still have to go to work after The rain was too good.

10
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,360
Oh Frenchmen!

11
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,860
Anyway, today we're going to be finishing sleeping dogs today.

12
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,200
Apparently there is only a few missions left.

13
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,020
So we are going to try and complete the game today.

14
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,280
I can't believe it's been...

15
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,340
Well, I can't believe we're at the final part already.

16
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,020
I thought...

17
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:04,380
I don't know.

18
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,540
I did play a lot.

19
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,580
I did play a lot already.

20
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:43,020
but like the game the game i don't know if the game is really good that like it doesn't feel like i've been playing for a while because like everything just links together so well so um so it doesn't feel like i'm doing a lot of missions but i have been playing sleeping dogs for a bit already all right let's go i was so happy with the daft punk concert though it was honestly i went in the expectations I went in with for the game were already sort of high but not really.

21
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:59,980
Okay, so it was originally high, the expectations for it, but there was like leaked document, like leaked summary info and leaked file, like people were leaking the files and stuff being like, oh, we're like data mining and it doesn't seem like there's any of the older songs,

22
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,520
it's just like the newer stuff they did, like get lucky and stuff like that.

23
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:30,720
and and they're like they didn't like they did disclaimer there was a blog summary of the event itself and the disclaimer was like oh that punk is not really getting back together and then they were like oh um this is not a concert it's an experience and i was like oh wait if it's not a concert then what the fuck are we getting like so i was like so my expectations are getting

24
00:07:34,060 --> 00:08:07,260
my god i'm so happy that like um the data mining was like not right not true and um and like i don't know why the fuck they said it wasn't a concert like that shit that was a concert like they gave they recreated a live 2007 why the fuck did they say it wasn't a concert yet uh i haven't done the game yet there you go here's the game i had such a good time It was definitely a really,

25
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:19,620
yeah, it was a fault, they spread false information to like set me up, to set, give me like low expectations, and then it exceeded everything I've ever wanted in a Daft Punk concert in Fortnite.

26
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,420
Gordon, thank you for the super chat, thank you for the magenta soup, thank you, thank you.

29
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:53,600
anymore they don't even before they retired we only got two tours before they retired

30
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:23,640
like I was so sad we only got two and yeah I do hope to get even more recognition than they already have and just to show them like they're so beloved to this day and like everyone still remembers them and maybe maybe we'll have a reunion concert in 2027 maybe just maybe

31
00:10:28,360 --> 00:11:24,640

32
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:30,400
And it's like they do one song too.

34
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,620
It's always a surprise appearance too.

35
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,180
They don't even know.

36
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,480
It's like, they're like, oh, surprise.

37
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,980
Like right there, live.

38
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:44,980
That bug's here.

39
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,180
And they're like, what?

40
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:50,520
And then you find out on Twitter.

41
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:57,640
You have to find out on Twitter that they were in this random concert appearance.

42
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,360
for two minutes before they disappear again.

43
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,560
I have to get FOMO'd.

44
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,780
But yeah, I'm just happy.

45
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,540
I'm just happy that Fortnite did this.

46
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,940
Like, we haven't had new Fortnite.

47
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:18,860
Oh, no, not Fortnite.

48
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:24,020
We haven't had new Daft Punk content in so long.

49
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,400
So, like, I'll take anything I can get, you know.

50
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,600
They'll throw some scraps on the floor, and then they're like, eat it.

51
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,220
And I'm like, oh, you're so kind to me, death, monk.

You think you're special?

116
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,000
You're not special.

117
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,060
Oh shit, not you.

118
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:07,540

Someone convinced Ming's brother to say it was alone.

147
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,660
Was that you?

148
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,160

00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,840
You heard about Uncle Pogo, right?

155
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:20,520
Yeah.

156
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,180
When's the funeral?

157
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:23,820
Like today?

158
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,900
I thought you'd be like, oh it's today.

159
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,560

160
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,360

00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,780

Alright, here we go.

169

We're here.

170
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:19,580
Oh, I pick up suits?

171
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,060
You don't own a suit, way?

172
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:27,370
Yeah, it's the perfect disguise, too.

173
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:29,850
Oh my god, you're so right.

174
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:32,590
I got rumored to be a whole man.

175
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:33,810
I'll take some, thanks.

176
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:37,450
Yeah, but I drive the police car ironically.

177
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,660
Alright, here we go.

I'll get you fitted You're very I'm already dressed in black these are the latest perfect for you for me

179
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,300
Elegant but not too flashy.

180
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:08,080
Oh nice, you know never thought I'd be able to afford a suit from a place like that Sucks that I have to get it for uncle post funeral Oh looking nice, bro.

181
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:15,940
All right, let's go So they don't know that we're actually criminals That's why I brought a police car.

182
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:41,380
It's the best undercover The best undercover vehicle for the job I'm so deep into how to cover I'm pretending to be a I'm a cop pretending to be a thug to be a cop and pretending to be a cop I bet it was the 18k You gotta make those assholes pay the fine The perfect stealth mission a triple agent

183
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,760
Was he in there for like a week?

184
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:02,380
I mean, it's not like I'm cut out to do anything else, but sitting in there, shit.

185
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,160
Now we're going to a funeral.

186
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,140
Who's the future in this shit?

187
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:06,900
You know what I mean?

188
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:07,440
I do.

189
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,800
All right, keep going.

190
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,160
Sorry, we just had, we had a little, uh, there was a paha.

191
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:16,960
Just a little paha.

192
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,060
Do you make?

193
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,300
Oh, shit!

194
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,240
Am I going the right way?

195
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:22,840
Yeah.

196
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:24,760
Am I?

197
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,400
All that talk about being a big deal was just...

198
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:29,700
What?

199
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,300
That was a speed bump.

200
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:31,840
Yeah.

201
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:32,860
Right.

202
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,960
There's so many piles.

203
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:35,780
I know, right?

204
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,500
It's crazy.

205
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:37,440
Whoa!

206
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,860
Yeah, I'm Tropic Thunder.

207
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:41,920
Flames.

208
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,120
Never go full cop.

209
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:48,560
Alright,

210
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,120
thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you, sir.

211
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,380
Do you play Hadoop Disguise as another dude?

212
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,900
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

213
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:09,210
Alright, this way.

214
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:10,570
How far is it?

215
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,010
Okay, it's that, it's pretty far.

216
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:18,780
Wow!

217
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,240
I look how they set up the ring too.

218
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,380
They're like extra...

219
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:26,880
They set up the ring.

220
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,120
The moon and everything.

221
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:51,690
Oh, these were the people that killed them.

222
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:53,250
What the fuck are the 18K doing?

223
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:53,530
Yeah.

224
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:54,650
We're here to make a show.

225
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,530
Or maybe to start a fight.

226
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,990
I want people to know that they did it.

227
00:23:58,770 --> 00:23:59,710
I hear in one place.

228
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:03,110
I don't think they expected the police to be here, though.

229
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:06,170
I've been happy to see the cops before.

230
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:06,630
Hey.

231
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:08,670
Why are the cops here?

232
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:13,440
Huh?

233
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,240
They're fucking arresting him.

234
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,260
Sonny woke.

235
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:22,320
I've been looking forward to this moment for a long time.

236
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:22,880
Yes.

237
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,420
And it will make you look so good to your bosses.

238
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,780
They might even pat you on the head like an obedient dog.

239
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,080
Right up until the time that I walk.

240
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,000
Again.

241
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,260
Not this time, Sonny.

242
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:34,700
Come on.

243
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:38,560
Oh, so they can place their own guy into the position of power.

244
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,520
We got what we came for.

245
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,080
We're leaving.

246
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,120
Jesus, on funeral day?

247
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,280
You can't do this here.

248
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,740
It's a fucking funeral.

249
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,780
God damn, police.

250
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,620
Why don't you show some fucking respect, huh?

251
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,540
Why don't you?

252
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,360
The 18K are about to do this city a great public service.

253
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,120
And anyone who stays here deserves everything they get.

254
00:24:59,300 --> 00:24:59,840
Wait, what?

255
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,840
He's working for the 18K?

256
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:02,860
The cops are leaving?

257
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:03,840
What the fuck?

258
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,480
The 18K are going to- This is going to get bloody.

259
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,260
Come on.

260
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:07,880
What?

261
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,100
The double cross?

262
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:14,180
I told these motherfuckers what it means to me, son of a damn way.

263
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,140
Good acting.

264
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,160
No, they'll never expect you to be a cop.

265
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,600
Oh my god, they give you this shitty gun too.

266
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,200
Oh my god, where are our bodyguards?

267
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,300
You would assume the...

268
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,300
The fucking...

269
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,820
T-M-E would have fucking bodyguards!

270
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:33,480
If we're...

271
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,120
Oh my god.

272
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,000
If we're...

273
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,740
Oh my god, I need to check.

274
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,020
Nope, that's all the leaders.

275
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:37,880
That's all of us.

276
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,000
Okay, that's...

277
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,380
Oh, we're so fucking stupid.

278
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:46,020
I assume because we are all like, you know, triad leaders, we would all...

279
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:46,620
Okay, let's...

Yeah, I was just looping him.

303
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,020
Wait, give me a sec.

304
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,600
I'm grabbing the grenade launcher.

305
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,780
Where the fuck did the grenade launcher go?

306
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,360
It's not fair!

307
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,520
I shot him in the kidneys.

308
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,480
There we go.

309
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,180
Anyway, I'll trip these guys.

310
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:32,910
That's right.

311
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:33,950
Oh, no more ammo.

312
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:34,770
Oops.

313
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:36,230

Grab this gun.

00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:40,510
All right.

316
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,430
One more bullet to finish the job.

317
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:50,450
It disappeared with his soul.

318
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:53,790
I want to be surprised if I glitched down.

319
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:56,790
Eliminate the 18K in the parking lot.

320
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,170
What's this?

321
00:28:58,330 --> 00:28:59,330
A tactical rifle?

322
00:28:59,490 --> 00:28:59,870
Is it better?

323
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,230
Oh, it is.

324
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:03,450
That's tactical in the front.

325
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:05,110
That's when you know it's better.

326
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:06,190
Oh, hey, nice.

327
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:12,450
All right, let me through.

328
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:13,330
Oh!

329
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,240
We don't use hands here.

330
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,620
We kick our cover out.

331
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:28,810
All right, nice.

332
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:29,990
Where are the others?

333
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:36,530
Wait, what?

334
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:37,330
Did he call me?

335
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:41,490
Oh my god, okay.

336
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:45,590
One of the insults they said was, see, fuck, white.

337
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:47,170
Which means...

338
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,750
ass ghost.

339
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:51,210
He's like, you're an ass ghost.

340
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:51,970
And I'm like, what?

341
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:53,330
What did he call me?

342
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,490
Did he just call me an ass ghost?

343
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:59,110
He's like, keep on quiet.

344
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:10,130
Jesus, how many men are there?

345
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:14,130
Bro, thank god we're at a funeral parlor.

346
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:15,430
Thank god we're at a cemetery.

347
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:17,230
These guys are gonna get rich from us.

348
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,350
Alright, we have some new customers for you.

349
00:30:23,470 --> 00:31:44,750

351
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,410
Ricky, don't.

352
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:04,750
I like how they politely said, like, oh, it means let's go.

353
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:07,070
But he was there to be like, Ricky, leave!

354
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:12,830
He was to say, like, let's go.

355
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:13,470
He's like, leave.

356
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:19,310
Yeah, I'm like, bro, you're not really selling yourself right now.

357
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:20,870
It doesn't make you want to vote for it.

358
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:27,010
they get jesus

359
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:59,140

360
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,180
Let me...

361
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,040
Alright.

362
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,960
Oh, the PTSD is hitting hard right now.

363
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,620
I always have to be tactically prepared, guys.

364
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,300
I saw I gotta sleep in this.

365
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,400
It stays on.

366
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,500
I always gotta be prepared.

367
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,760
No, he definitely...

368
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,980
No, Wade definitely needs a lot of therapy.

369
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:50,440
but now what i'm saying is like that guy is like you guys better vote for me and i don't know if he just makes me like sort of makes me like not want to vote for him for some reason not a very good campaign speech

370
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:59,480
like i don't know doesn't feel like an election at that point

371
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:12,830
all right I gotta go to Wait, what is this machine called?

372
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:13,930
Civil Discord.

373
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:16,570
Oh, oh, we're gonna have a Discord meeting?

374
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:23,780
Let's go.

375
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,800
Alright, how far is A thousand meters?

376
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,580
Why can't they have this meeting closer to where I live?

377
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,800
Also, wait, actually.

378
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,700
Okay, why the fuck did I not wake up here?

379
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:43,200
Like, my home is...

380
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,700
My first home is closer to this Why did...

381
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:51,700
If I knew my meeting was going to be back in my old town, I would sleep there.

382
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,840
I should have taken a taxi.

383
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:54,400
You're right.

384
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,040
I didn't know it was that far.

385
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:01,950
Maybe I'll find it.

386
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:02,250
I can't...

387
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:03,470
There's no taxis anywhere.

388
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:08,130
It's raining, so all the taxis are being used right now.

389
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,470
You know how, like, if there's, like, um...

390
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:17,410
If there's bad weather, like, the Uber slash taxi prices go up because, like, they're so in demand.

391
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:51,920
everything i hate it when that happens i hate that when it takes like like 20 minutes to find an uber because it's raining or some oh did you guys hear um because there's like new fees um for uber uh a lot of people don't want to uber drive anymore because it's just not worth it so people are like doing their own self-driving service like uh what's it called They're doing,

00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,300
What is it called again?

394
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,420
I know the mission's right here, but I'm trying to think of what it's called.

395
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:03,880
You know, when you just call someone up and they'll arrive?

396
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,260
No, it's not a ride share.

397
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:09,380
Like, you don't even use any self-employed.

398
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:13,540
No, but like, they're like, they're like contractors.

Why am I beating them up?

402
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:25,320

Keep it here.

406
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,580
Don't be with the harbour when you're done.

407
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:34,880

00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,020

Nice.

427
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,120

Oh, shit!

436
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,840
Okay, I don't expect some of the stuff I'm doing.

He had a painful death.

474
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:36,850
God, he's so tanky.

475
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:38,050
It's all that.

476
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:40,590

Did Dragon be out here?

481
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:56,310
Has he been fighting one guy this entire time?

482
00:40:57,350 --> 00:40:59,750

00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,720
That's crazy.

484
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:09,440
My bro has been fighting one person this entire time.

00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,060
And I took down this entire army.

486
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,100
God, get out of my way!

487
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,300

00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,740
No, I'm with you all the way, boss.

498
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:11,060
We're with you, Wayne.

499
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:12,120
Just for once.

500
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:14,300
I'd like to fight someone outside my own triad, though.

501
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:17,580
Mama, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

502
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,480
Lonnie, thank you, the super chat, thank you, thank you.

503
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:25,920
Guy gets a table saw, two guys get crushed, one electric grid, then one just gets a dumpster, and another a Pepsi.

504
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,640
Thank you, the super chat, thank you, thank you.

505
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,920
definitely need a massage after this.

506
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,420
Oh man, I got the worst guns here.

507
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,200
The spread is too...

508
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,240
too big for this.

509
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:46,400
Okay, nice.

510
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,720
The NPCs are actually...

511
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,460
The AI is actually helping me.

512
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,740
Alright, we gotta swap guns though.

513
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,560
I hate this gun so much.

514
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:59,080
Okay, get inside the golden coin.

515
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:01,500
Oh, we got... we gotta save Mrs. Chill!

516
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,500
Oh, this is a nice restaurant.

517
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,160
They're in the market.

518
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:06,100
Coming from the market.

519
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,000
No, not the market.

520
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:09,500
Oh, my God.

521
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:10,220
I got a shotgun.

522
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,160
Okay, I got...

523
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:13,340
Whoa!

524
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:14,580
Where did I go?

525
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:16,860
You know what?

526
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:18,180
They're like, you gotta be closer.

527
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:19,220
We'll help you.

528
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:21,220
The game was like, don't worry.

529
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:22,600
We'll help you get closer.

530
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,380
Oh, shit!

531
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:26,860
I'm a...

532
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,280
Instant transmission.

533
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,180
Okay, maybe it's definitely not a good idea to stand behind a car.

534
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:45,390
I could tank a little, a bit of this.

535
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:46,330
Reloading!

536
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:50,810
Okay, there we go.

537
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:53,410
Now I got the gun I want.

538
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:57,210
Oh my god, it's the same gun.

539
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:03,550
It's the same gun.

540
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:27,460
fire yet so we're fine jesus where are you shooting me oh my god okay i don't know how i'm alive i hate oh my god oh my god you you mean to tell me i had a gun right here this entire time okay there you go now it's a lot easier

541
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:37,520
i can't believe there was a gun in front of me this entire time

542
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:42,220
see how much easier this

543
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:47,940
I always forget which one's jaw, which one's Yao.

544
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:54,280
I always get confused between left and right and cat in me.

545
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,080
I don't know, it's just not intuitive for me.

546
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:57,900
I was like, which one is Yao?

547
00:44:58,100 --> 00:44:58,740
Which one is Yao?

548
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,440
We're just a noodle restaurant.

549
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,900
Why the fuck is everyone shooting at us?

550
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:15,980
We don't have, oh my god.

551
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:18,420
We don't have nothing here.

552
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:22,320
Do you really think we make it enough?

553
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:25,900
There you go.

554
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:31,390
We are not that profitable.

555
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:36,630
You're kind of...

556
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:38,850
Whoa, Mrs. Chu, what's going on?

557
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:40,110
I'll go check it out.

558
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:42,570
You stupid bitch?

559
00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:42,970
What?

560
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:43,650
Where's Wyshen?

561
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:47,270
I got a message for him from Big Smile Lee.

562
00:45:47,890 --> 00:45:50,270
Just a piece of shit I'm looking for.

563
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:51,910
You're going to vote for Lee, you hear me?

564
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:53,810
They really want that recipe.

565
00:45:53,830 --> 00:46:29,400
Fuck you all your ancestors Oh shit guys We got a new special at the noodle shop guys Whoa Damn The meat sure does taste extra Grainy today Is that a ring in my Is that hair in my Yeah Don't mess with mama exactly The car survives I'm just gonna blow up this car.

566
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:29,940
Fuck it.

567
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,020
I think that's just easier.

568
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,320
There we go.

569
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:36,540
Oh, shit.

570
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:37,640
They're right behind me.

571
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:38,500
Don't worry.

572
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,200
Okay, I ran out of gun.

573
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:43,500
Oh, wait.

574
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,580
No, I saw one more bullet.

575
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:45,360
There you go.

576
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:53,280
Don't worry.

577
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:54,160
Oh, shit.

578
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:55,020
Fuck it.

579
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:02,940
All right, nice.

580
00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:08,450
Parkour.

581
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:09,670
Don't worry.

582
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:12,190
I'm really good at parkour.

583
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:16,250
Get a load of this.

584
00:47:17,290 --> 00:47:17,850
What's that?

585
00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:18,950
Is that grenade on tree?

586
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:21,950
Holy fuck.

587
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:29,850
The toggle between grenades and bullets.

588
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:31,990
Okay, I assume that's grenade.

589
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:34,950
Oh my god.

590
00:47:35,490 --> 00:47:36,770
Just a regular day in Hong Kong.

591
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:37,630
Hong Kong, guys.

592
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:43,280
Just the usual.

593
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:45,180
No coffee called or anything.

594
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:51,000
Just your daily territory wars, you know?

595
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:54,740
Daily turf wars in the streets of Hong Kong.

596
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:59,300
Actually, I'll just build this car.

597
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:01,200
That's just easier.

598
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:03,740
For that one guy, too.

599
00:48:08,850 --> 00:48:10,710
Let's Grab the bullets.

600
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:16,400
Oh my god, that guy's just running straight in.

601
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:16,980
He's crazy.

602
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:24,320
Oh my god, they're so far.

603
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:27,540
Oh, there, nice.

604
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:28,980
Wait, there's more?

605
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:30,080
Where are they?

606
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:31,800
Oh my god, they're all the way over there.

607
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:34,360
They were all the way over there.

608
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:38,000
You mean they were on the balcony.

609
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:41,540
They're like, wait, they're all over there.

610
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:42,240
I'm like, where?

611
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:43,880
You mean the ones that just died?

612
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:48,500
Oh,

613
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:53,980
well, that's awkward.

614
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:55,040
I let a lot of them die.

615
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:57,960
Are you done?

616
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:03,680
Day one, massage, day 10, gang war.

617
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:07,340
Oh, my God.

618
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:11,720
Oh, now they're here right after I've killed all of them.

619
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:14,780
That's crazy.

620
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:16,140
They're so good at their jobs.

621
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:20,440
Ever since I went undercover, the cops just haven't been the same, man.

622
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:24,780
I was literally carrying 80% of their job.

623
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,120
But you know what?

624
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,700
What if I just...

625
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,140
I forgot I can just kill them.

626
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:38,940
Okay, but what about the other guys?

627
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:41,620
They might be dead, but you can still arrest them, posthumously.

628
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:46,200
That's it.

629
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:47,380
I'm angry.

630
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:49,240
Get over here, boom!

631
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:49,860
Oh, shit.

632
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:52,320
That's right.

633
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,840
They really want some low opinion.

634
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:04,500
They heard Mrs. Chu was doing a one-time offer on the noodles.

635
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:06,500
And that's...

636
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:11,300
It's like, there's only 10 foes left, and then she'll never serve them again.

637
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:13,800
The noodles are serious business.

638
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:20,260
I like how they're like, lose them, and I was like, I'm just like, technically I'm losing them if they're dead.

639
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,300
They can't catch me if they're dead, technically, if you think about it.

640
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:27,800
I did it, guys.

641
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:31,920
I lost them, because they lost their lives.

642
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:33,580
Where the hell is Jackie?

643
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:34,300
I don't know.

644
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:35,720
I haven't seen them.

645
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:36,300
Call them.

646
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:38,520
They're not right.

647
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:41,540
No witnesses.

648
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:45,780
They didn't specify how to lose them.

649
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:48,860
Wow, where did they go?

650
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:49,560
I don't know.

651
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:50,500
You think they might have gone after it?

652
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:52,560
They went to Mrs. Chu.

653
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:54,440
Fuckers are going after everyone.

654
00:50:59,370 --> 00:50:59,870
Good.

655
00:51:00,130 --> 00:51:02,510
Thank God the police don't care about these random barrels.

656
00:51:07,930 --> 00:51:10,110
Lots of fresh meat tonight, boys!

657
00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:12,590
That's true.

658
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:14,990
Mrs. Chu now has a lot of...

659
00:51:15,470 --> 00:51:17,150
a lot of supplies now.

660
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:20,990
Just a lot of ingredients for her...

661
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:22,990
for a restaurant.

662
00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:24,670
She's gonna have to do grocery shopping along.

663
00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:25,890
For a long time.

664
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:31,980
Because meat's back on the menu.

665
00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:38,410
Alright.

666
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:48,530
This is some new stuff.

667
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:50,350
Oops.

668
00:51:51,390 --> 00:51:53,950
Okay, I still have a... I still have one more badge left.

669
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:55,830
I'm still keeping my badge.

670
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,760
What's the worst they can do is suspend me with a badge?

You got a lot of nerve after that ship Pendrew pulled at the funeral.

681
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:35,280
What, he sent you to finish the job?

682
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:36,920
Pedro doesn't know I'm here, right?

683
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,040
I'm completely violating protocol.

684
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:46,740
Look, I never wanted you for this job because I'm what dog eyes did to your sister and how you handle things in San Francisco What did I do in San Francisco?

00:54:58,260 --> 00:54:59,360
How did I cross-pendrew?

689
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:00,460
What is he gonna do arrest me?

690
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:01,580
Call me a rogue cop?

694
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,000
Come to the Aberdeen Dryad.

695
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:49,920
Come alone and unarmed.

696
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:51,280
Say I'm allowed to take a taxi.

697
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:54,380
They're like, come alone.

698
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:58,820
Can you send me the address so I can, like, send it to the Uber driver?

699
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:06,060
Can you?

700
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:13,280
Can you Google Maps me the address real quick?

701
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,320
Wait, where's the tax?

702
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:16,360
Oh, it's because it's raining.

703
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:17,080
All the taxis.

704
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:17,480
Oh, wait, no.

705
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:18,220
There's one taxi.

706
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:19,460
Oh, the light's up.

707
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:19,820
Look.

708
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:23,360
The light is up on top, which means the taxi is unoccupied.

709
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:26,880
Okay, never mind.

710
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,840
I'm not allowed to take a taxi, apparently.

711
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:30,260
God damn it.

712
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:33,620
I don't care if I'm not allowed to take a taxi.

713
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,600
I'll bring this cab no matter what.

714
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:38,840
Can you pay for my Uber, bro?

715
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:41,340
I don't care.

716
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:44,120
A taxi's coming with me, whether you like it or not.

717
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:52,680
Oh yeah, but anyway, going back to my story about Uber drivers, but a lot of, apparently, um, Uber drive, damn, bro, that's hardcore.

718
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:54,720
This taxi driver was listening to this song.

719
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:57,500
Um, a lot of Uber drivers now are freelancing.

720
00:56:57,860 --> 00:57:10,260
So they get like, uh, so they get like a consistent, you know, the ones that like, you know, the crazy people that actually talk to their Uber drivers, and then to get to know them, they like, get their numbers and stuff and be like, hey, I don't work at Uber anymore.

721
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:14,260
And more like cheaper deals on getting a ride to your place.

722
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:17,700
Like, you know, They always commute to places with Uber.

723
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:20,560
You can, like, hit me up and stop paying for...

724
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:22,360
Paying Uber.

725
00:57:40,330 --> 00:57:42,070
I'll get down there.

726
00:57:42,190 --> 00:57:45,150
He, like, looked down there, but I can't open the door.

727
00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:47,590
Oh, you're standing next to the door.

728
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:49,630
I can't go in.

729
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:53,510
What?

730
00:57:55,790 --> 00:57:57,790
Or do me down the alleyway.

731
00:57:58,090 --> 00:58:00,050
Oh my god, it's down the alleyway.

732
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:02,990
I was just like, what the fuck?

733
00:58:03,090 --> 00:58:03,670
Wait, no.

734
00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:05,610
Where?

735
00:58:05,910 --> 00:58:07,570
No, it tells me to go back.

736
00:58:08,010 --> 00:58:09,270
Which is the right door?

737
00:58:09,930 --> 00:58:11,390
Is it the one with the red light?

738
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:13,970
Why is he opening the door for me?

739
00:58:15,290 --> 00:58:15,710
Sir.

740
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:23,800
I like walked back and then it like told me like, that's not the way.

741
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,100

Looks like you belong in the trash!

748
00:59:49,270 --> 00:59:49,830
I think that's everything.

749
00:59:50,030 --> 00:59:50,650
That's all of it.

750
00:59:50,770 --> 00:59:51,510
They only gave me two.

751
00:59:51,810 --> 00:59:52,390
Oh, wait!

752
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:53,670
I don't even know what to say.

753
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:54,990
This shit is fucked up, bro.

754
00:59:56,890 --> 00:59:58,110
This one's a little fucked up.

755
00:59:58,190 --> 00:59:59,710
I don't even know what to say for this.

756
01:00:02,970 --> 01:00:04,550
Oh my god, there's the pyrograde.

757
01:00:06,810 --> 01:00:09,230
Looks like we're going to have a power outage today.

758
01:00:10,310 --> 01:00:12,430
Are you ready for your schedule power outage?

759
01:00:14,770 --> 01:00:16,530
I wonder if I could use this table.

760
01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:20,070
Oh, that's it.

761
01:00:20,190 --> 01:00:20,630
It's okay.

762
01:00:20,770 --> 01:00:22,110
You know what I do have, though?

763
01:00:23,430 --> 01:00:24,690
The trusty wall.

764
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:33,300
Oh my god, wait, he's still alive?

765
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:36,580
Bro, your head, you're bleeding from your head right now, bro.

766
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:58,320

01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:20,080

769
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:24,240
Alright, last guy.

770
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:27,100
I'm so sad I can't grapple the grappler.

771
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:31,060
That's right, get out of here.

772
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:36,580
Oh man, he's like, this is personal now.

773
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:42,040
He's like, that's it, I'll settle this myself.

774
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:43,060
Oh yeah?

775
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:44,940
Watch this.

776
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:46,780
Say hello.

777
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,200
Yeah, you trying to do a kick?

778
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:51,000
Nutshot.

779
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:51,500
Nutshot.

780
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:53,540
Say hello to my little friend.

781
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,040
Oh, you think it's over?

782
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:59,780
It's rewind time.

783
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:01,860
Oh, you think it's over still?

784
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:08,020
Looks like I'm doing a little redecorating.

785
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:13,620
I think this shade, this red, would go nicely on the wall.

786
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:21,060
You're just another break in the wall!

787
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:26,880
One more time.

788
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:32,340
Grab horse face.

789
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:33,580
Who the fuck is horse?

790
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:34,440
Oh, that's him.

791
01:02:34,940 --> 01:02:35,100
Oh.

792
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:36,720
Where's Jackie?

793
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:38,680
You're never going to find him.

794
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:40,220
Oh, yeah?

795
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:42,180
That's right.

796
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:43,780
Tell me where he is now.

797
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:45,340
Okay.

798
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:49,640
Oh, do I interrogate him here?

799
01:02:49,780 --> 01:02:50,880
Oh, shit.

800
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:51,520
Stop.

801
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:53,560
Where's Jackie?

802
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:54,480
I don't know.

803
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:57,480
You don't know.

804
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:58,780
I was just supposed to kill you.

805
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:02,150
I don't know.

806
01:03:02,610 --> 01:03:04,490
Bro, I just wanted to kill you, bro.

807
01:03:04,650 --> 01:03:05,030
Come on.

808
01:03:07,010 --> 01:03:08,290
How do I get to him?

809
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:09,170
I don't know.

810
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:12,740
You tell me, and I might...

811
01:03:12,740 --> 01:03:13,500
Where is he?

812
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:16,280
I only talk to him on my phone.

813
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:16,940
Oh, wait.

814
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:19,840
Oh, shit.

815
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:21,840
I was like, wait, is the line looping?

816
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:24,740
Go back up the street to get...

817
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:25,940
A better signal.

818
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:29,900
It's not a big deal, Teehee.

819
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:31,400
I just wanted to kill you.

820
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:32,720
Hehehe.

821
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:36,180
Is it really that bad?

822
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:39,220
In my car?

823
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:40,120

01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:53,660
Wait, I have an SUV.

836
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:56,360
You say I'm fast enough?

837
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:02,760
That bot.

838
01:05:04,420 --> 01:05:06,080
Got a faster car.

839
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:08,040
Oh, wait, there it is.

840
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:10,680
Okay, yeah, I was not gonna...

841
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:12,160
I was not gonna reach them.

842
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:14,840
At least he dropped his cell phone, right?

843
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:17,020
Wait, where is his cell phone?

844
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:20,460
Wait, where did he drop his cell phone?

845
01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:22,880
Is it the bike?

846
01:05:25,220 --> 01:05:28,540
Where the fuck did he drop the cell phone?

847
01:05:37,730 --> 01:05:39,450
Wait, did he...

848
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:42,430
through the floor?

849
01:05:43,870 --> 01:05:45,230
Are you

850
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:49,220
kidding me?

851
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:50,420
He like fell.

852
01:05:50,940 --> 01:05:53,040
The boy it has him now.

853
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:56,480
The boy it has him.

854
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:00,100
Oh my god.

855
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:02,860
Bro, that's his bike.

856
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,560
I was like, where did he go?

857
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:10,580
I think I think he phased through.

858
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:13,940
It's in the wall.

859
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:36,080
Alright, we're gonna have to Oh my god We're gonna have to restart From checkpoint, yes Please not be that far Oh, there he is Where am I Wait, did he have a heart attack?

860
01:06:36,540 --> 01:06:37,300
Wait, did he...

861
01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:46,760
He had a fucking heart attack or something Where the fuck am I?

862
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:52,260
He got on the bike and he just again collapsed.

863
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:53,700
He got death noted.

864
01:06:56,860 --> 01:06:58,640
Oh, there it goes.

865
01:06:58,720 --> 01:06:59,300
Sliding.

866
01:07:00,060 --> 01:07:01,580
And he's slipping away.

867
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:05,460
He's escaping quick, Doki.

868
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:06,380
Grab him.

869
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:09,360
He broke the game because he was too good.

870
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:11,480
Josh, the human is super.

871
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:12,780
Does he slide near this?

872
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:13,500
Oh.

873
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:16,240
And now the bush has him.

874
01:07:16,620 --> 01:07:18,640
He has returned to nature, everyone.

875
01:07:19,460 --> 01:07:21,920
He has returned to nature.

876
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:23,980
Will he face through here?

877
01:07:28,790 --> 01:07:30,090
Oh, it's stopped.

878
01:07:30,930 --> 01:07:32,350
Oh, it's because he can't go through.

879
01:07:32,550 --> 01:07:34,430
He's back to the nature.

880
01:07:34,770 --> 01:07:35,410
Let's go.

881
01:07:39,090 --> 01:07:41,690
Nature has reclaimed his body.

882
01:07:42,930 --> 01:07:45,130
Okay, I don't want to fuck around.

883
01:07:47,170 --> 01:07:48,810
salty crab in Kennetown.

884
01:07:51,930 --> 01:07:53,630
I was so confused.

885
01:07:53,910 --> 01:07:55,390
I was like...

886
01:07:55,390 --> 01:07:57,910
I was like, what the fuck happened?

887
01:07:59,170 --> 01:08:00,470
Why couldn't I?

888
01:08:01,390 --> 01:08:03,170
Where did his body go?

889
01:08:03,230 --> 01:08:04,850
That was the easiest chase ever.

890
01:08:05,390 --> 01:08:06,110
Thank God.

891
01:08:06,590 --> 01:08:09,130
The game was like, she's on an SUV.

892
01:08:09,690 --> 01:08:11,510
We gotta give her a bone.

893
01:08:12,170 --> 01:08:12,830
Like...

894
01:08:13,570 --> 01:08:16,390
There was no way she was gonna catch up.

895
01:08:17,310 --> 01:08:28,650
We gotta do something It's skipped and then I guess we'll never know we'll never oh my god I would steal this car the cop wasn't there

896
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:38,920

01:08:43,940 --> 01:08:47,260

899
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:03,180

01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:06,780

901
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:08,420
Don't worry.

902
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:11,180
You'll definitely get your car back.

903
01:09:15,570 --> 01:09:17,050
Holy shit, this is a fast-ass car.

904
01:09:22,110 --> 01:09:23,390

918
01:10:05,870 --> 01:10:06,550

01:10:16,470 --> 01:10:18,370
Now this is a police movie.

923
01:10:18,870 --> 01:10:21,070
Now this is a Hong Kong police movie.

924
01:10:22,650 --> 01:10:24,450
Another day for the cops.

925
01:10:29,690 --> 01:10:31,010

929
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:16,200

930
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:18,820
Come over here.

931
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:19,980
I've had enough.

932
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:21,820
Get over here.

933
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:24,320
I'm done with you.

934
01:11:29,430 --> 01:11:30,210
There you go.

935
01:11:39,740 --> 01:11:40,320
It's five.

936
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:44,380
If I just keep shooting them, they'll die.

937
01:11:47,900 --> 01:11:49,260
I'm not even going fast.

938
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:51,240
How am I doing proper damage?

939
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:52,720
I'm just on a boat!

940
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:59,700
That's right, leave the boat.

941
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:04,940
Boom!

942
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:07,260
Oh my god, if that boat explodes, I'm fucked.

943
01:12:07,780 --> 01:12:08,440
There we go.

944
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,280
I escaped the ambush.

945
01:12:12,180 --> 01:12:14,220
They didn't say how they escaped the ambush.

946
01:12:17,140 --> 01:12:18,960
The Ocean Man returns.

947
01:12:19,580 --> 01:12:20,220
The sequel.

948
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:24,020
They thought they saw the last of Ocean Man.

949
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:30,140
But every five years, he returns to claim another victim.

950
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:33,360
What is that?

951
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:33,760
Jackie!

952
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:36,920
Jackie!

953
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:37,820
Jackie, shit!

954
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:38,940
Oh, fuck!

955
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:40,820
Don't worry, I got you, Jackie!

956
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:44,320
Oh, shit, that too, the last job.

957
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:44,760
You okay?

958
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:46,000
Fuck, fuck, man.

959
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:47,540
Oh, man.

960
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:49,960
That must be traumatizing.

961
01:12:50,060 --> 01:12:52,320
Being buried alive seems really fucking scary.

962
01:12:53,020 --> 01:12:55,080
Like, incredibly claustrophobic, too.

963
01:12:55,660 --> 01:12:58,340
I thought I was gonna die like an animal, man.

964
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:00,180
Fucking, like a dog or something.

965
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:01,280
Come on, brother.

966
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:02,320
You're okay.

967
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:04,520
i got your back fuck

968
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:19,840
remember mr beast would actually do like um would actually put himself in these stunts but now he just pays other people to do of shit

969
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:36,100
i remember when mr beast used to use to put his own life in danger for money now he's just too rich so he pays other people to do his thing do stuff for content

970
01:13:42,800 --> 01:14:04,520
i can't believe it even he started outsourcing yeah you see did like there was a famous video i mean he has a lot of bio videos but one of the first bio videos i watched from him was when he buried himself alive Now it's just Mr. Beast of Gladiator Games.

971
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:07,780
Now he just outsourced everything.

972
01:14:08,540 --> 01:14:09,720
So what do you want to do now, Jackie?

973
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:10,960
Elections tomorrow.

974
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:14,460
We want to check out the build and make sure that Big Smile Lee isn't planning any surprises.

975
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:15,720
But we got some time to kill.

976
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:17,500
I don't know.

977
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:20,580
I almost bought it today, man.

978
01:14:21,260 --> 01:14:21,620
Real.

979
01:14:22,940 --> 01:14:26,080
I think I'm just going to go take a walk or something.

980
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:29,180
Oh, you got, like, kidnapped because you're by yourself.

981
01:14:29,620 --> 01:14:30,040

He just got fucking...

985
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:37,480
He almost died.

986
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:38,400
He's like, you know what?

987
01:14:38,940 --> 01:14:40,640
I got kidnapped because I was alone.

988
01:14:40,780 --> 01:14:42,460

989
01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:45,040

01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:46,000
Don't worry, bro.

991
01:14:46,580 --> 01:14:48,180
They treat me like a VIP there.

999
01:15:43,140 --> 01:15:44,020
This is too real.

1012
01:16:13,700 --> 01:16:14,320
Don't leave.

1013
01:16:14,740 --> 01:16:15,340
Don't leave.

1014
01:16:15,460 --> 01:16:16,520
I need my Uber.

1015
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:20,340
Oh my god, bro.

1016
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:21,720
That cab is so fucking fast.

1017
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:22,680
Wait, is that an Uber?

1018
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:22,960
No.

1019
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:24,940
Look, look.

1020
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:26,220
It's open for business.

1021
01:16:27,620 --> 01:16:27,860
Okay.

1022
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:30,300
Oh my god.

1023
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:34,040
I'll make him stop.

1024
01:16:35,140 --> 01:16:35,660
There we go.

1025
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:36,980
Sarah, I need him.

1026
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:38,200
I need a ride real quick.

1027
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:40,960
Sir, please.

1028
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:42,360
Sir, please.

1029
01:16:43,460 --> 01:16:44,020
Oh, thank God.

1030
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:44,720
Okay.

1031
01:16:48,620 --> 01:16:49,220
There you go.

1032
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:53,060
It's so sensitive.

1033
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:55,160
The cab hunter.

1034
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:59,020
Yeah, not complaining now that I paid you.

1035
01:16:59,980 --> 01:17:00,740
That's right.

1036
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:02,260
Yeah, I live here.

1037
01:17:06,630 --> 01:17:07,910
I have a confession.

1038
01:17:08,050 --> 01:17:09,190
Someone was like, it's not even that far.

1039
01:17:09,450 --> 01:17:10,990
I have Uber Eated.

1040
01:17:11,070 --> 01:17:18,130
Uber ate, or Uber eats a restaurant that was literally like six minutes away.

1041
01:17:21,750 --> 01:17:23,270
Walking distance.

1042
01:17:27,650 --> 01:17:30,550
I have done that before.

1043
01:17:32,950 --> 01:17:35,810
I am a part of the problem.

1044
01:17:37,770 --> 01:17:41,050
I have indeed, it was literally a six minute.

1045
01:17:41,070 --> 01:17:42,130
and walk away.

1046
01:17:44,270 --> 01:17:45,150
Wait, come and meet me.

1047
01:17:45,270 --> 01:17:46,250
I have something to show you.

1048
01:17:46,390 --> 01:17:47,990
Oh, what does Jackie have to show me?

1049
01:17:58,760 --> 01:17:59,640
Yeah, I do.

1050
01:18:00,540 --> 01:18:01,540
My favorite car.

1051
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,500
Hey, you seems to be okay.

1052
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:09,100
Not like someone stole his phone last time.

1053
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:13,360
Where is it?

1054
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:14,640
Oh, the election.

1055
01:18:14,780 --> 01:18:14,980
There you go.

1056
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:16,200
Wait, how far is it?

1057
01:18:20,740 --> 01:18:22,760
I guess it's just so convenient.

1058
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:41,800
like you know what you discover uber eats and like uber eats or grub hub or uber like you just can't stop it's just it's just so i can't go back i can't go back i don't want to driving for myself Wait, I could just hire someone else to do it for me?

1059
01:18:48,970 --> 01:18:50,510
Her door dash?

1060
01:18:58,520 --> 01:18:59,080
Jackie?

1061
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:00,820
Fucking knew it.

1062
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:02,900
Jackie, you fucking dumbass.

1063
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:04,400
Jackie?

1064
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:06,700
Oh!

1065
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:09,320
Jackie!

1066
01:19:10,380 --> 01:19:11,100
Fuck!

1067
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:12,600
Jackie!

1068
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:19,280
Oh my god!

1069
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:20,740
Oh!

1070
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:27,860
Hello, Mr. Shen.

1071
01:19:28,860 --> 01:19:32,000
Or should I say, Officer Shen.

1072
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:36,080
My name is Mr. Tom.

1073
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,240
Perhaps you heard of me?

1074
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:38,840
Fuck you!

1075
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:40,000
I'm no cop.

1076
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:41,640
Oh!

1077
01:19:42,140 --> 01:19:43,820
Your friend Jackie didn't think so.

1078
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:46,300
You think a massage would fix it?

1079
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:48,700
But then, I suspect you wouldn't have told him any.

1080
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:49,440
Oh!

1081
01:19:51,580 --> 01:19:54,540
You must be a very dangerous man, Wei Shen.

1082
01:20:00,420 --> 01:20:01,920
Son of a bitch, I'll kill you.

1083
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:04,220
Save your energy, Mr. Shen.

1084
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:05,600
You'll need it.

1085
01:20:06,380 --> 01:20:10,180
The last cup I had in this chair lasted almost 48 hours.

1086
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:12,640
Would you like to try for a new record?

1087
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:15,960
I understand your personal reasons for doing this.

1088
01:20:17,740 --> 01:20:19,460
From my tattoos.

1089
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:21,160
They're very expensive.

1090
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:24,880
Before I'm done with you, you will confirm them.

1091
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:27,640
And then you will die.

1092
01:20:28,180 --> 01:20:28,500
Oh!

1093
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,280
That's what worries me, Wei.

1094
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:32,920
You're one of them.

1095
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:35,140
Oh god!

1096
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:39,600
Their actual torture methods too.

1097
01:20:40,900 --> 01:20:41,600
Loyalty.

1098
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:42,840
Discretion.

1099
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:46,020
John would be disgraced.

1100
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:47,960
How would they, how did they know I'm a cop?

1101
01:20:50,260 --> 01:20:53,540
Bro, I told them, I told them I was undercover.

1102
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:55,960
That's why my car was a police car.

1103
01:20:58,660 --> 01:21:03,700
I was like, oh, they would never expect me to be a gang member if I have a police car.

1104
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:08,400
How did they know?

1105
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:44,220
Boy, when I was wearing that tactical uniform, when I was wearing that tactical uniform i'll just go to my local larp the police larping club you know i wanted to be in if i to order to like make sure i don't get arrested oh my god i have to crawl this is pathetic to make sure i don't get arrested i gotta be no one's like to be a cop you know it's a mystery yeah i was just playing airsoft too yeah sometimes we play airsoft every every friday

Okay, isn't there a guy like slowly watching me do all of this?

1107
01:21:57,980 --> 01:21:59,980
Oh god, this is so pathetic.

1108
01:22:03,060 --> 01:22:04,040
Yeah, I was good at sit.

1109
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:06,140
How the fuck am I gonna survive?

1110
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:11,700
Oh shit, that's how!

1111
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:19,340
Looks like you're having light problems.

1112
01:22:20,780 --> 01:22:22,360
Want me to help you change the light bulb?

1113

I did!

1118
01:23:12,290 --> 01:23:12,750
I thought!

1119
01:23:13,110 --> 01:23:13,750
Oh, no!

1120
01:23:14,010 --> 01:23:14,750
I didn't realize!

1121
01:23:15,350 --> 01:23:15,730
Oh!

1122
01:23:16,370 --> 01:23:18,970
I thought he would keep peeing.

1123
01:23:19,250 --> 01:23:20,790
He was a long-ass bee!

1124
01:23:21,470 --> 01:23:23,090
How is I supposed to know?

1125
01:23:24,550 --> 01:23:28,410
I thought it was just an infinite cutscene until he was done.

1126
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:36,660
Well, I can't do anything but counters.

1127
01:23:37,060 --> 01:23:38,920
I'm too light-headed right now.

1128
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:43,080
It's the only thing I can do.

1129
01:23:43,100 --> 01:23:50,280
I did it It's I thought it was unlimited.

1130
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:53,280
I wonder if I was able to if I would have done like a

1131
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:00,220
Special kill if I'd like if I actually press B

1132

Wait, he's still watching TV.

1134
01:24:45,590 --> 01:24:46,210
Do you see the other guy?

1135
01:24:46,370 --> 01:24:46,830
They're just...

1136
01:24:46,830 --> 01:24:48,730
He's just jamming on the TV?

1137
01:24:49,270 --> 01:24:49,770
No!

1138
01:24:50,510 --> 01:24:52,410
Not locked back in the door!

1139
01:24:53,610 --> 01:24:55,210
I'm so sad.

1140
01:24:57,350 --> 01:24:58,550
Here's Johnny.

1141
01:25:00,710 --> 01:25:02,330
I'm so sad.

1142
01:25:03,930 --> 01:25:05,090
They're really...

1143
01:25:08,410 --> 01:25:09,590
This was...

1144
01:25:09,610 --> 01:25:10,550
It is pretty.

1145
01:25:11,130 --> 01:25:11,630
Gotta check it.

1146
01:25:11,830 --> 01:25:13,610
There's asbestos in the drywall.

1147
01:25:14,210 --> 01:25:15,230
There you go.

1148
01:25:17,270 --> 01:25:18,570
I should have pressed B, guys.

1149
01:25:18,690 --> 01:25:19,370
I'm so sad.

1150
01:25:24,410 --> 01:25:25,690
Play through ruin.

1151
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:32,560
Come on, get over here.

1152
01:25:33,140 --> 01:25:33,700
Get over here.

1153
01:25:33,780 --> 01:25:34,520
I gotta use you.

1154
01:25:34,820 --> 01:25:36,640
Looks like the elevator is out of order.

1155
01:25:44,860 --> 01:25:45,780
Alright, get over here.

1156
01:25:46,820 --> 01:25:48,320
Oh my god, what the fuck is this?

1157
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:48,940
Alright, let's see.

1158
01:25:49,020 --> 01:25:50,320
I'm pretty sure I put him through the pull, right?

1159
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:50,700
Oh!

1160
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:51,880
Oh!

1161
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:53,920
Oh my god, yeah, you saw that?

1162
01:25:58,260 --> 01:25:58,580
Man.

1163
01:25:59,580 --> 01:26:01,740
Careful, you might have a...

1164
01:26:02,260 --> 01:26:03,740
Oh, it looks like you have it.

1165
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:05,220
Oh, come on.

1166
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:06,060
Let me pick you up.

1167
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:07,620
I got the one right.

1168
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:09,000
Oh, man, careful.

1169
01:26:09,140 --> 01:26:11,280
It looks like you might have a splitting headache right now.

1170
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:12,900
Gotta get that checked out.

1171
01:26:14,380 --> 01:26:15,240
Oh, there's more.

1172
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:16,480
Nice.

1173
01:26:17,100 --> 01:26:17,660
All right.

1174
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:18,880
Get over here.

1175
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:27,640
All right.

1176
01:26:29,380 --> 01:26:29,560
Oh.

1177
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:32,700
Looks like I got a meal prep today.

1178
01:26:35,260 --> 01:26:35,820
Oh,

1179
01:26:39,490 --> 01:26:39,530
wait.

1180
01:26:39,650 --> 01:26:41,550
Is that fridge also a special one?

1181
01:26:47,190 --> 01:26:47,690
Hey, yeah.

1182
01:26:47,750 --> 01:26:49,530
Remember to clean your fridge.

1183
01:26:51,650 --> 01:26:52,830
That's fucking right.

1184
01:26:54,670 --> 01:26:54,970
All right.

1185
01:26:55,130 --> 01:26:55,490
Nice.

1186
01:26:55,630 --> 01:26:56,290
We did it.

1187
01:26:57,190 --> 01:26:57,470
Dinner.

1188
01:26:57,490 --> 01:26:58,130
Sir!

1189
01:26:59,290 --> 01:27:01,470
Wait, what?

1190
01:27:02,090 --> 01:27:02,990
We're still talking.

1191
01:27:03,190 --> 01:27:04,290
I killed all of them.

1192
01:27:05,310 --> 01:27:06,410
I wonder the body is still there.

1193
01:27:06,590 --> 01:27:07,010
Oh wait, no.

1194
01:27:07,330 --> 01:27:09,470
The elevator's closed down.

1195
01:27:11,830 --> 01:27:12,870
Where did these guys come from?

1196
01:27:13,110 --> 01:27:14,650
Oh, what were they doing in the closet?

1197
01:27:15,210 --> 01:27:15,570
Whoa.

1198
01:27:24,050 --> 01:27:27,470
It's like, damn, what were they doing in that closet?

1199
01:27:27,490 --> 01:27:30,550
Meep, thank you for the 10, give the chips, thank you, thank you.

1200
01:27:31,750 --> 01:27:33,850
There's seven minutes in heaven.

1201
01:27:38,430 --> 01:27:46,910
And for someone that just got tortured and, like, had holes drilled into their knees, this has to be the adrenaline right now.

1202
01:27:49,350 --> 01:27:54,550
I'm like, bro, I just had, like, I think I lost, like, 40% of my blood.

1203
01:27:56,790 --> 01:27:59,510
The adrenaline actually is going crazy right now.

1204
01:27:59,530 --> 01:28:13,870
out that's right get over here looks like we blew a fuse

1205
01:28:25,720 --> 01:28:39,420
you just broke a glass bottle all right that looks like something i can use what is that i don't barbecue season!

1206
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:42,300
Did you want it?

1207
01:28:44,060 --> 01:28:46,700
Did you want it extra well done?

1208
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:49,660
Or is there anything else?

1209
01:28:49,940 --> 01:28:50,720
I think that's everything.

1210
01:28:51,580 --> 01:28:52,740
That means you know what that means.

1211
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:54,120
I'm just gonna throw you against.

1212
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:55,980
Oh, I can't throw you off the building?

1213
01:28:56,520 --> 01:28:58,260
That seems so easy to do.

1214
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:01,760
For one henchman extra crispy.

1215
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:06,140
That sound seems so easy to do.

1216
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:11,880
but they were having a barbecue

1217
01:29:17,750 --> 01:29:18,790
oh shit

1218
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:31,120
oh my god there's too many people there's too many people that's it I'm bringing one out of the equation

1219
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:38,460
okay give me a sec to the wall

1220
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:47,720
that's right if all else fails I have the wall invisible walk.

1221
01:29:48,620 --> 01:29:49,640
Divide and conquer.

1222
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:54,780
There we go.

1223
01:29:54,920 --> 01:29:56,100
Might as well break your leg, too.

1224
01:29:57,620 --> 01:29:58,520
Like, grab him!

1225
01:29:58,820 --> 01:30:00,140
Not if I grab you first.

1226
01:30:00,260 --> 01:30:00,660
Oh, shit.

1227
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:01,140
Not him.

1228
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,740
I can't grab him first, unfortunately.

1229
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:08,240
It's alright.

1230
01:30:08,300 --> 01:30:09,320
I'll just kick him in the balls.

1231
01:30:11,080 --> 01:30:15,800
Even if you're ungravable, your balls are still vulnerable.

1232
01:30:16,900 --> 01:30:19,240
Doesn't mean I can't kick you in the balls right now.

1233
01:30:19,260 --> 01:30:19,620
Oh, wait.

1234
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:20,880
Maybe you can just grab me.

1235
01:30:23,820 --> 01:30:38,300
there we go that's fucking right oh shit he can still grab oh no no no no no no no all right we'll just start kicking him his one weakness apparently is just ball kicks

1236
01:30:41,730 --> 01:30:57,790
there we go all right i got his one weakness wow father macy I like how they added hell to it, but he's just saying what's going on.

1237
01:30:58,850 --> 01:30:58,950
Oh.

1238
01:31:01,170 --> 01:31:02,530
Oh, no, it's stealth task.

1239
01:31:05,950 --> 01:31:06,990
Oh, what do you know?

1240
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:13,080
Where the fuck do I go?

1241
01:31:23,340 --> 01:31:24,980
Didn't I get in and get past that?

1242
01:31:26,740 --> 01:31:27,260
Oh, my God.

1243
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:28,080
He saw me, didn't he?

1244
01:31:28,360 --> 01:31:28,800
Oh, my God.

1245
01:31:28,940 --> 01:31:29,340
He saw me.

1246
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:30,300
Oh, my God.

1247
01:31:30,440 --> 01:31:30,880
He saw me.

1248
01:31:31,940 --> 01:31:32,660
Oh, my God.

1249
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:33,020
It's okay.

1250
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:33,600
I'm here.

1251
01:31:41,640 --> 01:31:43,440
He's still gonna grapple you.

1252
01:31:45,590 --> 01:31:46,990
Oh my god, he's still got it.

1253
01:31:48,450 --> 01:31:49,770
Bro, at that point, you could have just shot me.

1254
01:31:50,050 --> 01:31:51,510
Oh my god, wait, not now though.

1255
01:31:51,970 --> 01:31:52,610
I didn't mean...

1256
01:31:52,610 --> 01:31:53,750
Oh, my back!

1257
01:31:53,830 --> 01:31:54,390
I'm paralyzed!

1258
01:31:56,170 --> 01:31:58,730
I'm paralyzed now.

1259
01:32:03,370 --> 01:32:04,110
I got this.

1260
01:32:04,190 --> 01:32:04,690
Watch this.

1261
01:32:09,580 --> 01:32:09,980
Oh, shit.

1262
01:32:12,180 --> 01:32:34,860
shit it's okay i could take it i could take this that's why you can't predict this you can't shoot me man he shot me in the back it was like magneto sent that bullet fly that's right stealth

1263
01:32:40,470 --> 01:32:41,650
That's right.

1264
01:32:42,830 --> 01:32:43,930
Stealth mode.

1265
01:32:52,390 --> 01:32:52,810
There you go.

1266
01:32:54,270 --> 01:32:55,470
So stealthy.

1267
01:32:57,730 --> 01:32:59,730
Don't worry, don't never know.

1268
01:32:59,830 --> 01:33:01,090
I'm stealthy right now.

1269
01:33:04,730 --> 01:33:05,590
Don't never know.

1270
01:33:06,390 --> 01:33:07,430
A perfect stealth.

1271
01:33:11,020 --> 01:33:11,580
Alright, reload.

1272
01:33:14,340 --> 01:33:16,180
Oh shit, double kill, nice.

1273
01:33:18,930 --> 01:33:21,470
Oh shit, okay, I should stop taking that.

1274
01:33:24,410 --> 01:33:25,730
There you go.

1275
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:31,200
One more shot, one bullet in a dream.

1276
01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:34,440
Okay, it was Ashley too.

1277
01:33:35,540 --> 01:33:36,180
Feel it!

1278
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:41,160
Handgun is stronger, only because like, I can accurately shoot it.

1279
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:42,520
Yeah, there you go.

1280
01:33:45,680 --> 01:33:46,660
Yep, I'm here.

1281
01:33:47,180 --> 01:33:48,440
He's like, I know you're here.

1282
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:49,220
Yeah, there you are.

1283
01:33:50,900 --> 01:33:51,640
There we go.

1284
01:33:54,020 --> 01:33:55,780
Yeah, I mean, he wasn't wrong.

1285
01:33:56,200 --> 01:33:57,420
I was here.

1286
01:33:59,880 --> 01:34:01,280
Yeah, this is definitely faster.

1287
01:34:03,580 --> 01:34:05,420
They just line up their heads for me.

1288
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:08,740
I think the last guy is like, wait, where is the last guy?

1289
01:34:10,300 --> 01:34:11,680
He's like, I know you're here.

1290
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:13,220
I wasn't hiding.

1291
01:34:13,340 --> 01:34:14,660
All right, perfect shot.

1292
01:34:23,830 --> 01:34:26,350
That's what you know, I'm an FPS gamer.

1293
01:34:27,550 --> 01:34:29,450
Line it perfectly.

1294
01:34:32,970 --> 01:34:34,310
I know where it was.

1295
01:34:38,270 --> 01:34:39,570
Good cover, bro.

1296
01:34:40,310 --> 01:34:41,310
Wait, it is good cover.

1297
01:34:41,890 --> 01:34:43,170
Wait, that was good cover.

1298
01:34:49,030 --> 01:34:49,510
Headshot.

1299
01:34:51,110 --> 01:34:53,450
I didn't say wishhead.

1300
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:58,720
The muscle memory.

1301
01:35:04,250 --> 01:35:05,030
What the fuck?

1302
01:35:05,130 --> 01:35:06,030
I'm like, where is the cover?

1303
01:35:07,330 --> 01:35:08,770
Yeah, that's definitely the cover.

1304
01:35:12,030 --> 01:35:12,650
Oh shit.

1305
01:35:13,030 --> 01:35:13,770
Oh shit.

1306
01:35:13,970 --> 01:35:15,550
Why am I reloading in the open?

1307
01:35:15,990 --> 01:35:16,990
Oh, there you go.

1308
01:35:22,590 --> 01:35:23,150
There you go.

1309
01:35:23,630 --> 01:35:24,410
One guy left.

1310
01:35:25,390 --> 01:35:26,810
Oh wait, is he like...

1311
01:35:26,810 --> 01:35:28,770
Oh, I actually got like burns on him.

1312
01:35:34,410 --> 01:35:41,270
Yeah, I don't think they got the shot Actually Excuse me?

1313
01:35:41,450 --> 01:35:42,190
What is this made of?

1314
01:35:42,490 --> 01:35:44,970
What is this?

1315
01:35:45,830 --> 01:35:47,290
What is this made of titanium?

1316
01:35:51,110 --> 01:35:54,410
I'm like, why can't I shoot it?

1317
01:35:56,570 --> 01:35:58,130
And where I'm in the pool

1318
01:36:08,420 --> 01:36:10,520
I don't think he's having any kids today

1319
01:36:15,270 --> 01:36:24,170
Nice shot you think I got him Where's my gun can I just not pick up my gun back?

Oh my god, I'm a little fucked up right now.

1362
01:40:32,230 --> 01:40:32,510
It's okay.

1363
01:40:32,590 --> 01:40:32,970
Watch this

1364
01:40:36,830 --> 01:40:43,480
Wait, he's still oh, yeah, no, he's dead dead.

1365
01:40:43,720 --> 01:40:44,880
No, oh he is very dead.

1366
01:40:46,060 --> 01:40:47,920
Oh my god the watch this actually worked

1367
01:40:53,340 --> 01:40:56,740

1368
01:41:02,450 --> 01:41:06,410
Poor Jackie Fuck the election.

1369
01:41:07,250 --> 01:41:08,170
You did this, Lee.

1370
01:41:09,030 --> 01:41:10,890
And I'm coming for you.

1371
01:41:12,090 --> 01:41:12,590
Motherfucker.

1372
01:41:13,530 --> 01:41:15,990
I did not expect them to kill off, Jackie.

1373
01:41:18,730 --> 01:41:20,730
I legitimately did not expect it.

1374
01:41:23,250 --> 01:41:25,490
I thought we were gonna be bros for life!

1375
01:41:26,130 --> 01:41:28,870
I thought we were gonna go into the sunset on the boat!

1376
01:41:32,130 --> 01:41:33,170
And like...

1377
01:41:33,170 --> 01:41:35,010
Live with new identities and everything.

1378
01:41:35,030 --> 01:41:39,210
Everything I'm just gonna drive this car away.

1379
01:41:39,790 --> 01:41:41,370

I like the way you think.

1382
01:42:12,890 --> 01:42:15,210
That's the attitude that makes us strong.

1383
01:42:16,550 --> 01:42:17,070
Loyalty.

1384
01:42:17,590 --> 01:42:18,110
Discretion.

1385
01:42:18,550 --> 01:42:20,370
Used to be more common.

1386
01:42:22,030 --> 01:42:23,530
I'm here for Miss Lily.

1387
01:42:24,290 --> 01:42:26,090
I take a huge hug on Big Smiley.

1388
01:42:28,290 --> 01:42:29,650
That's what worries me, Wei.

1389
01:42:30,170 --> 01:42:31,610
You're one of them.

1390
01:42:33,270 --> 01:42:34,410
Where you cross Pendry.

1391
01:42:35,450 --> 01:42:36,210
He's cutting you off.

1392
01:42:36,630 --> 01:42:37,350
Wait, yeah?

1393
01:42:37,550 --> 01:42:39,210
Want the rally exit?

1394
01:42:39,990 --> 01:42:40,590
Oh, oops.

1395
01:42:41,450 --> 01:42:43,130
You look after our people, okay?

1396
01:42:44,950 --> 01:42:46,630
Man, this big spot late, man.

1397
01:42:46,790 --> 01:42:49,330
This guy just fucking grabbed me at the fucking funeral.

1398
01:42:50,630 --> 01:42:52,330
Toss me up to 18k, man.

1399
01:42:54,410 --> 01:42:57,090
You show your true colors to that, brother.

1400
01:42:58,610 --> 01:42:59,530
Oh, God!

1401
01:42:59,930 --> 01:43:00,750
I'm sorry, please!

1402
01:43:01,050 --> 01:43:01,190
Please!

1403
01:43:01,390 --> 01:43:02,190
No, no, no!

1404
01:43:02,570 --> 01:43:05,630
Oh my god, the PDSC is kicking hard right now.

1405
01:43:05,670 --> 01:43:05,730
I must stop this once.

1406
01:43:11,510 --> 01:43:14,650
No matter what happens, Jackie, I won't leave you behind.

1407
01:43:15,310 --> 01:43:18,850
I always come back for you, Jackie.

1408
01:43:18,870 --> 01:43:20,110
I'm a best friend, man.

1409
01:43:20,790 --> 01:43:22,850
That means more than a boss, you know.

1410
01:43:24,550 --> 01:43:26,690
I always come back.

1411
01:43:27,170 --> 01:43:28,250
He was most loyal.

1412
01:43:30,250 --> 01:43:33,690
I know you have a personal stake here, but this cannot be of indebted.

1413
01:43:33,890 --> 01:43:34,470
We're cops.

1414
01:43:35,130 --> 01:43:35,690
There are rules.

1415
01:43:37,570 --> 01:43:39,290
It might be time for me to make a change.

1416
01:43:40,530 --> 01:43:41,490
Maybe going to business with me.

1417
01:43:41,510 --> 01:43:49,250

A bow and massage therapy shop, two for one special.

1420
01:44:20,350 --> 01:44:24,290
Have a pork bun before your massage and a pork bun after.

1421
01:44:28,950 --> 01:44:31,250
All right, that's it.

1422
01:44:32,230 --> 01:44:32,990
That's it.

1423
01:44:35,250 --> 01:44:37,050
You were part of the problem.

1424
01:44:39,990 --> 01:44:41,810
That's actually pretty fucked up.

1425
01:44:44,250 --> 01:44:45,030
You did.

1426
01:44:45,250 --> 01:44:46,530
She was also in the...

1427
01:44:46,530 --> 01:44:49,010
Yo, just because she's a woman, I can't kill her.

1428
01:44:50,770 --> 01:44:52,230
She was also...

1429
01:44:52,230 --> 01:44:52,670
Oh, no!

1430
01:44:53,030 --> 01:44:53,410
No!

1431
01:44:55,710 --> 01:44:58,010
I don't think that girl is...

1432
01:44:58,010 --> 01:44:58,670
What do you mean?

1433
01:44:58,750 --> 01:45:00,170
She was there with them.

1434
01:45:01,950 --> 01:45:03,810
Yo, that's a mess.

1435
01:45:04,210 --> 01:45:06,030
Killed by association.

1436
01:45:06,330 --> 01:45:07,310
Alright, who's first?

1437
01:45:07,870 --> 01:45:10,310
So why was she hanging out with them, huh?

1438
01:45:11,710 --> 01:45:12,870
This is like...

1442
01:46:32,590 --> 01:46:36,050
Okay, I didn't think there were 20 of them, okay?

1443
01:46:36,530 --> 01:46:40,370
I would have known that there would be 20 men in front of me.

1444
01:46:43,270 --> 01:46:46,330
I thought I would have consistent 1v1s.

1445
01:46:47,470 --> 01:46:48,350
Parry this.

1446
01:46:49,810 --> 01:46:51,550
I thought I could parry!

1447
01:46:56,830 --> 01:46:59,670
Alright, I'm so sad I gotta get rid of it.

1448
01:47:00,750 --> 01:47:02,890
I gave him a stupid gun.

1449
01:47:03,790 --> 01:47:06,890
It brings a knife to a gun, right?

1450
01:47:13,340 --> 01:47:13,820
Alright.

1451
01:47:14,660 --> 01:47:17,480
Now I just gotta give boring headshots now.

1452
01:47:21,180 --> 01:47:21,780
Alright, reload.

1453
01:47:25,730 --> 01:47:27,150
Doesn't feel the same.

1454
01:47:27,830 --> 01:47:30,610
The only joy I can get out of this are the nuts shots.

1455
01:47:31,130 --> 01:47:31,730
I think he's...

1456
01:47:31,730 --> 01:47:32,370
Oh my god.

1457
01:47:32,510 --> 01:47:33,510
Yeah, he's way too close.

1458
01:47:33,870 --> 01:47:35,350
Oh my god, don't worry, I'm fine here.

1459
01:47:35,690 --> 01:47:36,910
You can't shoot through this.

1460
01:47:37,530 --> 01:47:39,690
He's too stupid to realize that's also in cover.

1461
01:47:42,990 --> 01:47:44,070
Shoot his hand.

1462
01:47:45,910 --> 01:47:47,050
Oh my god, I can't shoot his arm.

1463
01:47:50,250 --> 01:47:51,270
Where am I?

1464
01:47:51,690 --> 01:47:53,750
Oh my god, TP me all the way back.

1465
01:48:08,270 --> 01:48:09,030
That's right.

1466
01:48:09,270 --> 01:48:10,210
Get an ass shot.

1467
01:48:11,110 --> 01:48:13,190
The wrong side, motherfucker.

1468
01:48:14,330 --> 01:48:15,010
Defeat thugs.

1469
01:48:15,050 --> 01:48:15,870
There's more?

1470
01:48:18,910 --> 01:48:20,230
Where are they?

1471
01:48:21,650 --> 01:48:23,130
Oh, they're right below me.

1472
01:48:23,630 --> 01:48:24,450
Okay, there you go.

1473
01:48:26,010 --> 01:48:27,510
That's fine, this one's easy.

1474
01:48:31,950 --> 01:48:33,150
I was like, where are the others?

1475
01:48:37,880 --> 01:48:39,000
Right here.

1476
01:48:42,120 --> 01:48:42,960
Come on.

1477
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:46,120
Oh, you're so lucky.

1478
01:48:46,500 --> 01:48:47,660
You are so lucky.

1479
01:48:47,700 --> 01:48:49,720
It was perfectly aligned, too.

1480
01:48:51,280 --> 01:48:52,140
There you go.

1481
01:48:52,220 --> 01:48:53,400
I still got you in the nuts.

1482
01:48:56,880 --> 01:48:58,280
I still got it.

1483
01:49:00,660 --> 01:49:01,900
Can I shoot through this?

1484
01:49:03,880 --> 01:49:05,300
I think I can.

1485
01:49:08,200 --> 01:49:09,260
My shoulder!

1486
01:49:11,800 --> 01:49:12,440
Alright.

1487
01:49:14,360 --> 01:49:14,740
What?

1488
01:49:17,300 --> 01:49:19,100
Where am I supposed to go?

1489
01:49:20,900 --> 01:49:22,060
Like, down here.

1490
01:49:22,080 --> 01:49:24,080
Oh shit down here.

1491
01:49:28,940 --> 01:49:30,520
I don't know if this does anything.

1492
01:49:32,020 --> 01:49:34,420
Alright, last two are like over down there.

I'm too lazy.

1497
01:49:42,180 --> 01:49:43,820
I'll let the environment do my job.

1498
01:49:48,120 --> 01:49:49,860
Work smarter, not harder guys.

1499
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:51,920
Okay, never mind.

1500
01:49:52,120 --> 01:49:53,840

That's not on me.

1520
01:51:16,850 --> 01:51:18,890

That's on her.

1538
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:22,900
But can I just go straight to killing him?

1539
01:52:23,140 --> 01:52:23,780
Let me check.

1540
01:52:31,680 --> 01:52:32,660
I can't imagine.

1541
01:52:37,500 --> 01:52:38,080
No!

1542
01:52:38,620 --> 01:52:39,100
No!

1543
01:52:39,660 --> 01:52:40,960
Wait, it was so close.

1544
01:52:41,300 --> 01:52:41,640
Wait, wait, wait.

1545
01:52:41,740 --> 01:52:42,920
No, I think I can't.

1546
01:52:43,220 --> 01:52:44,810
I might just focus fire him.

1547
01:52:55,260 --> 01:52:55,840
Easy.

1548
01:52:57,800 --> 01:52:59,160
I told you.

1549
01:52:59,400 --> 01:53:00,760
Just focus on him.

1550
01:53:00,940 --> 01:53:03,000
Okay, now we can focus on the other.

1551
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:04,620
On your left.

1552
01:53:06,400 --> 01:53:07,340
There we go.

1553
01:53:11,180 --> 01:53:11,540
Easy.

1554
01:53:13,220 --> 01:53:14,500
Okay, they should just like give up.

1555
01:53:14,600 --> 01:53:16,000
I literally killed the boss.

1556
01:53:19,900 --> 01:53:21,660
They should have been like, I surrender.

1557
01:53:22,040 --> 01:53:22,960
The boss is dead.

1558
01:53:23,480 --> 01:53:24,440
You now work for me.

1559
01:53:24,560 --> 01:53:25,760
I'm the alpha here.

1560
01:53:29,820 --> 01:53:30,760
Look, I killed your boss.

1561
01:53:30,940 --> 01:53:34,380
I think you should know, you should think like, you know who I am.

1562
01:53:35,220 --> 01:53:35,920
Oh, this is bad.

1563
01:53:36,040 --> 01:53:36,520
This is bad.

1564
01:53:36,600 --> 01:53:37,140
There's no cover.

1565
01:53:38,460 --> 01:53:39,140
Can I use the fishes?

1566
01:53:42,480 --> 01:53:44,880
Oh my god, if only...

1567
01:53:45,560 --> 01:53:46,140
Wait, what?

1568
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:50,840
Oh my god, this is terrible cover.

1569
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:53,960
I don't have cover!

1570
01:53:54,320 --> 01:53:55,140
Oh wait, here.

1571
01:54:05,120 --> 01:54:08,000
Guys, if I could, I'll do it for the last guy.

1572
01:54:15,330 --> 01:54:15,850
Alright.

1573
01:54:34,990 --> 01:54:35,370
Oh!

1574
01:54:35,650 --> 01:54:37,270
Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!

1575
01:54:37,610 --> 01:54:39,090
Oh shit, he wasn't the last guy!

1576
01:54:39,450 --> 01:54:40,630
He wasn't the last guy!

1577
01:54:42,550 --> 01:54:43,750
Oh, I didn't kill him.

1578
01:54:44,850 --> 01:54:45,250
There we go.

1579
01:54:45,650 --> 01:54:47,150
I just didn't kill him.

1580
01:54:48,090 --> 01:54:49,050
Get phased.

1581
01:54:49,750 --> 01:54:49,970
Okay.

1582
01:54:52,510 --> 01:54:54,870
Surely this won't fuck me over, right?

1583
01:54:55,610 --> 01:54:58,030
I'm gonna kill you.

1584
01:54:58,030 --> 01:54:59,350
Oh boy, wow, there's a gun.

1585
01:54:59,690 --> 01:54:59,850
Oh!

1586
01:55:02,150 --> 01:55:02,630
Shit.

1587
01:55:04,370 --> 01:55:04,850
How?

1588
01:55:05,450 --> 01:55:06,530
Time to die, Lee.

1589
01:55:06,650 --> 01:55:07,930
That was three shells.

1590
01:55:14,220 --> 01:55:15,680
I saw my fish.

1591
01:55:19,790 --> 01:55:21,590
Yeah, there's no way I live, right?

1592
01:55:22,550 --> 01:55:25,590
Minus 5% for being clumsy?

1593
01:55:26,110 --> 01:55:27,030
Oh, I'm sorry.

1594
01:55:27,190 --> 01:55:28,970
I have blood loss.

1595
01:55:29,430 --> 01:55:31,670
I just got shot in the shoulder.

1596
01:55:32,350 --> 01:55:33,370
How the fuck?

1597
01:55:36,930 --> 01:55:38,250
I'm sorry.

1598
01:55:38,890 --> 01:55:42,890
Oh, take my license for being clumsy ever after taking it.

1599
01:55:44,310 --> 01:55:46,310
entire fucking shotgun pellet.

1600
01:56:07,440 --> 01:56:09,780
My life still?

1601
01:56:12,680 --> 01:56:14,120
Jesus Christ.

1602
01:56:14,920 --> 01:56:17,200
Oh, the salt in the wounds too.

1603
01:56:17,620 --> 01:56:20,660
Oh, the ocean in the wounds.

1604
01:56:20,960 --> 01:56:22,020
That's not good.

1605
01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:35,480
Why is there a gas station in the middle of the river?

1606
01:56:43,760 --> 01:56:44,580
You're pussy.

1607
01:56:51,560 --> 01:56:52,260
You're done.

1608
01:56:56,670 --> 01:56:58,950
Piece of fucking shit.

1609
01:56:59,570 --> 01:56:59,910
Fuck.

1610
01:57:00,150 --> 01:57:00,390
Oh!

1611
01:57:01,190 --> 01:57:02,350
How does it feel, Pig?

1612
01:57:02,790 --> 01:57:05,430
To know that your boss sold you out.

1613
01:57:06,610 --> 01:57:07,950
And you fucked your way.

1614
01:57:08,470 --> 01:57:10,770
Almost as bad as you fucked Jackie.

1615
01:57:11,270 --> 01:57:12,830
You were supposed to die with Winston.

1616
01:57:13,130 --> 01:57:31,430

Oh my heart's beating so fast Oh, it's sad.

1626
01:58:37,370 --> 01:58:37,910
It's time.

1627
01:58:39,750 --> 01:58:42,930
Did anyone order some ice to go in their drink?

1628
01:59:12,850 --> 01:59:14,050
Ice, ice, baby.

1629
01:59:27,640 --> 01:59:28,760
Hey, easy their way.

1630
01:59:29,960 --> 01:59:30,980
This man is in my custody.

1631
01:59:31,620 --> 01:59:31,940
Yes, sir.

1632
01:59:32,580 --> 01:59:32,860
You okay?

1633
01:59:33,340 --> 01:59:33,540
Yeah.

1634
01:59:34,820 --> 01:59:35,820
Where's Pendrew?

1635
01:59:36,320 --> 01:59:37,220
He's up for promotion.

1636
01:59:37,840 --> 01:59:38,260
What?

1637
01:59:39,360 --> 01:59:39,840
Interpol?

1638
01:59:40,500 --> 01:59:42,520
He gets away with everything?

1639
01:59:42,900 --> 01:59:44,060
He ought to meet a big smiley.

1640
01:59:44,660 --> 01:59:45,480
Take it from me, Wei.

1641
01:59:46,140 --> 01:59:47,300
Whatever you heard, it won't matter.

1642
01:59:48,080 --> 01:59:49,380
The only voice they hear is Penrose.

1643
01:59:50,580 --> 01:59:52,160
You did what you came here to do.

1644
01:59:52,360 --> 01:59:52,440
Alright?

1645
01:59:54,140 --> 01:59:55,400
Let's get you cleaned up.

1646
02:00:01,230 --> 02:00:02,710
Oh my god!

1647
02:00:03,730 --> 02:00:05,710
He gets to go to Interpol?

1648
02:00:10,920 --> 02:00:13,140
The rich truly do get richer.

1649
02:00:21,670 --> 02:00:26,690
Yep, the fuck you mean get clean I need a blood transfusion right now.

1650
02:00:27,030 --> 02:00:29,190
I lost 70% of my blood

1651
02:00:34,740 --> 02:00:40,700
Bro, can anyone like dig out the fucking shotgun bullet out of my shoulder, too?

1652
02:00:48,710 --> 02:01:02,790
I knew I told you Superintendent Pendril Classic Hong Kong cop movies you're the one The British white guy who's in charge of the police is always dirty.

1653
02:01:02,790 --> 02:01:05,190
I can imagine all sorts of reasons.

1654
02:01:06,050 --> 02:01:07,530
I'm sure you will tell me.

1655
02:01:07,970 --> 02:01:14,050
I'm moving on to greener pastures, but not without taking care of some unfinished business with you and Sonny first.

1656
02:01:14,690 --> 02:01:16,670
We had a deal, did we not, Pendrel?

1657
02:01:17,950 --> 02:01:19,630
I gave you the three tigers.

1658
02:01:20,230 --> 02:01:21,310
It made your career.

1659
02:01:21,510 --> 02:01:23,430
And I let you and Sonny continue operating.

1660
02:01:24,010 --> 02:01:25,790
A sacrifice you were willing to make.

1661
02:01:28,030 --> 02:01:30,130
putting some away and with you gone.

1662
02:01:30,570 --> 02:01:32,250
I'll finish this once and for all.

1663
02:01:38,030 --> 02:01:42,030
The only difference between you and me is...

1664
02:01:44,950 --> 02:01:49,570
I know what I am.

1665
02:01:54,540 --> 02:01:57,280
Did he like put air into his infusion?

1666
02:01:58,860 --> 02:01:59,960
Jesus Christ.

1667
02:02:01,180 --> 02:02:02,680
Or like a judge

1668
02:02:13,180 --> 02:02:40,080
Poison you can also give an air bubble oh that that's it that is that easy I don't like just give they don't even give me a montage I he's just he's just in jail now Whatever I did I made Hong Kong a better place Bro, there was gang wars It was like I was like I clearly didn't enter for it.

1669
02:02:40,780 --> 02:02:42,160
How was that better?

1670
02:02:42,880 --> 02:02:43,940
We're open carry.

1671
02:02:44,820 --> 02:02:45,500
One of them.

1672
02:02:46,600 --> 02:02:49,560
You deserve to be handed over to Big Smile Lee.

1673
02:02:49,820 --> 02:02:50,180
Did I?

1674
02:02:51,220 --> 02:02:53,600
Well, Pedro, I guess everyone gets what he deserves.

1675
02:02:53,880 --> 02:02:55,800
There were shootouts in the streets.

1676
02:02:56,460 --> 02:02:57,680
You ready for life in prison?

1677
02:02:58,440 --> 02:02:58,680
What?

1678
02:02:59,460 --> 02:03:02,460
Because all your old buddies are going to be waiting for you.

1679
02:03:03,480 --> 02:03:06,060
I made sure they found out what you did to Uncle Poe.

1680
02:03:06,380 --> 02:03:07,960
That's a fucking death sentence.

1681
02:03:08,440 --> 02:03:16,400
I know where you can't I won't last a day in there That's the plan

1682
02:03:25,360 --> 02:03:30,340
Inspector officer I just wanted to say thanks for what?

1683
02:03:31,080 --> 02:03:42,980
It's me who should be helping me close cases do something I could feel good about hell for helping me stay sane my pleasure So what are you gonna do now?

1684
02:03:43,460 --> 02:03:49,680
Yeah, good luck surviving prison punk My job's over, but I don't really have anywhere else to go.

1685
02:03:50,520 --> 02:03:56,320
It's strange to say it after all that's happened, but Hong Kong kind of feels like home.

1686
02:03:58,320 --> 02:03:58,800
Yeah.

1687
02:04:00,680 --> 02:04:01,980
But which Hong Kong officer?

1688
02:04:02,940 --> 02:04:03,020
Oh!

1689
02:04:09,400 --> 02:04:10,780
And what about Wei Shen?

1690
02:04:11,820 --> 02:04:13,880
He proved himself to be loyal to me.

1691
02:04:14,720 --> 02:04:15,860
One way or the other.

1692
02:04:16,900 --> 02:04:18,480
And isn't that what really matters?

1693
02:04:19,400 --> 02:04:20,860
Leave him be.

1694
02:04:21,640 --> 02:04:22,320
Yes, I'm Jay.

1695
02:04:24,200 --> 02:04:24,640
Drive.

1696
02:04:32,600 --> 02:04:34,140
Wait, that's it?

1697
02:04:36,660 --> 02:04:40,060
Bro, and we never got a sleeping dog's true after?

1698
02:04:41,300 --> 02:04:44,340
Bro, that was the most obvious sequel, babe.

1699
02:04:44,860 --> 02:04:46,640
And like...

1700
02:04:46,640 --> 02:04:49,200
We never got a sequel?

1701
02:04:52,360 --> 02:04:53,560
We never

1702
02:05:00,020 --> 02:05:01,020
got a sequel!

1703
02:05:02,160 --> 02:05:03,880
That's so good!

1704
02:05:10,150 --> 02:05:12,350
The dogs are still sleeping.

1705
02:05:14,710 --> 02:05:16,550
I can't believe it.

1706
02:05:17,630 --> 02:05:18,830
Because it's like...

1707
02:05:19,710 --> 02:05:23,850
I guess it's like an open-ended ending.

1708
02:05:24,190 --> 02:05:25,890
Because we don't know if he's like...

1709
02:05:25,890 --> 02:05:26,950
If he still works...

1710
02:05:27,370 --> 02:05:30,930
If he wants to work with the triads or...

1711
02:05:30,930 --> 02:05:32,490
But he doesn't have Jackie anymore.

1712
02:05:32,610 --> 02:05:34,350
Like nothing ties him to the triad.

1713
02:05:35,830 --> 02:05:36,450
for Jackie.

1714
02:05:37,010 --> 02:05:40,730
So I feel like why would he continue to work with the Triads after that?

1715
02:05:43,850 --> 02:05:45,610
Oh, the studio shut down?

1716
02:05:47,190 --> 02:05:48,530
Oh, it's so sad.

1717
02:05:49,670 --> 02:05:52,590
I feel like the game did really well too.

1718
02:05:53,890 --> 02:05:54,990
It didn't do well?

1719
02:05:55,310 --> 02:05:56,270
I thought it did.

1720
02:05:56,590 --> 02:06:00,210
I had like good memories of like people talking about sleeping dogs.

1721
02:06:01,770 --> 02:06:03,070
Um, and a singular super chat.

1722
02:06:03,150 --> 02:06:03,410
Thank you.

1723
02:06:03,490 --> 02:06:04,050
Thank you.

1724
02:06:05,830 --> 02:06:07,590
He seems like he's going to be picking up soap.

1725
02:06:07,730 --> 02:06:08,510
Thank you, the super chat.

1726
02:06:08,570 --> 02:06:09,490
Thank you, thank you.

1727
02:06:14,910 --> 02:06:16,070
I feel like...

1728
02:06:17,070 --> 02:06:18,330
I feel like...

1729
02:06:20,230 --> 02:06:21,210
Like, I don't know.

1730
02:06:21,330 --> 02:06:22,210
Because it's like...

1731
02:06:22,210 --> 02:06:22,890
I don't know.

1732
02:06:22,910 --> 02:06:25,170
I feel like he wouldn't lean towards the triads.

1733
02:06:25,310 --> 02:06:28,830
Only because, like, the only one that was, like, his anchor was Jackie.

1734
02:06:30,550 --> 02:06:32,630
And also, everybody knows he's a cop now.

1735
02:06:32,990 --> 02:06:34,990
So, it feels a little weird.

1736
02:06:35,870 --> 02:06:38,010
Unless they want him to be, like, their rat.

1737
02:06:38,170 --> 02:06:38,310
You know?

1738
02:06:38,730 --> 02:06:44,910
in the cop, like a dirty cop, but I also feel like Wei wouldn't be a dirty cop in general.

1739
02:06:45,090 --> 02:06:46,630
He did all of that for undercover.

1740
02:06:49,430 --> 02:06:51,650
Strike, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

1741
02:06:51,750 --> 02:06:55,470
Thanks a bunch for playing this great game, but just notwithstanding.

1742
02:06:55,670 --> 02:06:57,290
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

1743
02:06:57,490 --> 02:06:58,930
Yeah, I had such a fun time.

1744
02:06:59,030 --> 02:06:59,710
It was so cool.

1745
02:07:00,010 --> 02:07:03,930
I had a great time, like, exploring Hong Kong too, and it's, like, memory lane.

1746
02:07:04,350 --> 02:07:08,670
Mine is the turf wars and the...

1747
02:07:09,990 --> 02:07:13,290
The turf wars and the gunfights in the streets.

1748
02:07:13,850 --> 02:07:17,750
It really did feel like Hong Kong, other than the violent parts.

1749
02:07:20,090 --> 02:07:21,770
Mehdi, thank you for the super chat.

1750
02:07:21,970 --> 02:07:22,570
Thank you, thank you.

1751
02:07:22,850 --> 02:07:27,210
When it got popular, it was already too late, from what I remember.

1752
02:07:27,930 --> 02:07:29,390
Yeah, minus the crime.

1753
02:07:32,510 --> 02:07:34,010
Mehdi, thank you for the super chat.

1754
02:07:34,210 --> 02:07:34,990
Thank you, thank you.

1755
02:07:35,870 --> 02:07:38,470
Check out the another trailer.

1756
02:07:38,730 --> 02:07:40,410
see your sequel in the hand-to-hand combat.

1757
02:07:40,790 --> 02:07:41,510
Thank you for the super chat.

1758
02:07:41,670 --> 02:07:41,750
Thank you.

1759
02:07:42,190 --> 02:07:42,410
Thank you.

1760
02:07:44,590 --> 02:07:44,910
Sorry.

1761
02:07:45,150 --> 02:07:45,930
Thank you for the super chat.

1762
02:07:46,130 --> 02:07:46,210
Thank you.

1763
02:07:46,510 --> 02:07:46,710
Thank you.

1764
02:07:47,030 --> 02:07:50,010
Now we'll never know why the dogs were sleeping.

1765
02:07:50,910 --> 02:07:52,430
Is there an after-credit scene?

1766
02:08:03,270 --> 02:08:03,930
Oh, yeah!

1767
02:08:04,490 --> 02:08:06,530
Wasn't there supposed to be a movie?

1768
02:08:08,070 --> 02:08:08,950
I remember.

1769
02:08:09,210 --> 02:08:11,030
I remember seeing the news about that.

1770
02:08:11,130 --> 02:08:13,730
They were planning on uh...

1771
02:08:15,710 --> 02:08:44,230
They were planning on making a movie for this they got canceled too that's so sad i can't believe got canceled as well i feel like maybe maybe if this game was released at a later time i don't know i don't know i don't know if this game was was too good for its time at like um was released too early for its time Or too late.

1772
02:08:44,630 --> 02:08:45,190
I don't know.

1773
02:08:45,390 --> 02:08:47,250
Because I feel like it was really good.

1774
02:08:49,490 --> 02:08:50,190
So I don't know.

1775
02:08:50,430 --> 02:08:52,270
Like what they could have done.

1776
02:08:53,210 --> 02:08:53,890
To like.

1777
02:08:55,050 --> 02:08:57,370
Increase the popularity at the time.

1778
02:09:02,600 --> 02:09:04,480
There was a lot of similar games back then.

1779
02:09:04,580 --> 02:09:05,180
That's true.

1780
02:09:05,280 --> 02:09:05,660
There's like.

1781
02:09:05,820 --> 02:09:07,180
Was it Watchdogs?

1782
02:09:07,860 --> 02:09:08,380
Watchdogs?

1783
02:09:08,600 --> 02:09:09,380
Assassin's Creed.

1784
02:09:09,820 --> 02:09:10,980
I think GTA 5.

1785
02:09:11,480 --> 02:09:11,740
Yeah.

1786
02:09:11,820 --> 02:09:14,240
Was it released around GTA 5 too?

1787
02:09:14,740 --> 02:09:16,020
That might have been it.

1788
02:09:21,880 --> 02:09:48,360
maybe it was like after GTA 5 it would have done a lot better Saints Row oh I forgot about Saints Row yeah there was like Saints Row as well and they released this like maybe like maybe in 2015 or some shit or 2016 I think maybe it would have done a lot better

1789
02:10:00,100 --> 02:10:29,540
at that time the genre was way too crowded yeah now nowadays it's harder to make like open world like gta like games now not a lot of games do it very well i think this was really well done it was very like huge throwback to um to like classic um classic hong kong police oh my god three $150,000.

1790
02:10:30,020 --> 02:10:30,480
That's crazy.

1791
02:10:30,660 --> 02:10:32,880
Wait, I got a plainclothes cop outfit.

1792
02:10:32,980 --> 02:10:34,060
What does that look like?

1793
02:10:36,580 --> 02:10:38,100
It was a great experience.

1794
02:10:38,240 --> 02:10:40,440
I had a fun time playing us.

1795
02:10:40,480 --> 02:10:43,080
I'm so happy to find me able to play Sleeping Dogs.

1796
02:10:44,260 --> 02:10:44,980
Oh, is it this one?

1797
02:10:45,360 --> 02:10:46,080
Detective Chen?

1798
02:10:47,520 --> 02:10:49,300
This is a really shout cop for me.

1799
02:10:49,860 --> 02:10:50,940
It just looks like my funeral.

1800
02:10:51,140 --> 02:10:51,940
Wait, it's literally...

1801
02:10:51,940 --> 02:10:54,040
I'm literally wearing the same shirt and pants.

1802
02:10:57,720 --> 02:11:18,880
I'm I'm wearing it's interchangeable it's interchangeable to to my funeral outfit all right let's see this is the perfect outfit to go get a massage all right one last massage for the ride oh my god am I wearing socks with my sandals oh my god wait no okay it's just They're my sneakers.

1803
02:11:20,700 --> 02:11:22,340
Men's wardrobe, be like.

1804
02:11:24,160 --> 02:11:24,900
That's true.

1805
02:11:25,060 --> 02:11:31,120
I feel like, okay, for me, I feel like, um, you're very limited.

1806
02:11:32,040 --> 02:11:42,480
If you watch for male VTubers, they're very limited to, like, uh, well, actually might need a, which one is, oh, it has to be here.

1807
02:11:42,520 --> 02:11:43,400
There's a K-bar here.

1808
02:11:44,220 --> 02:11:47,260
You're very limited to, like, what kind of outfits you can get.

1809
02:11:52,310 --> 02:11:54,950
All right, one last massage.

1810
02:11:59,140 --> 02:12:02,640
Is this literally suit or, like, not suit?

1811
02:12:04,360 --> 02:12:09,340
I feel like suit, sweater, or t-shirt.

1812
02:12:14,240 --> 02:12:16,900
One more for the road.

1813
02:12:24,920 --> 02:12:26,340
Alright, and a pork bun.

1814
02:12:27,260 --> 02:12:30,120
One last pork bun and massage for the road.

1815
02:12:32,800 --> 02:12:35,120
Hello, can I...

1816
02:12:35,120 --> 02:12:35,960
Wait.

1817
02:12:37,400 --> 02:12:39,680
I gotta move a little bit.

1818
02:12:40,180 --> 02:12:43,860
He won't sell me the pork bun because I'm like, blocking the street.

1819
02:12:45,160 --> 02:12:46,760
No, sir, please!

1820
02:12:47,980 --> 02:12:49,520
He didn't like what I did.

1821
02:12:50,060 --> 02:12:51,300
I get iron tire.

1822
02:12:51,700 --> 02:12:52,560
Where the fuck is that?

1823
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:54,000
Oh, get tire tire.

1824
02:12:54,060 --> 02:12:55,060
We have a...

1825
02:12:55,700 --> 02:12:56,400
What the fuck?

1826
02:12:56,520 --> 02:12:57,880
I stole this car.

1827
02:12:58,100 --> 02:12:58,560
What?

1828
02:13:02,140 --> 02:13:02,540
No!

1829
02:13:04,340 --> 02:13:08,940
It doesn't want to sell it before you get fired from pork buns.

1830
02:13:09,860 --> 02:13:13,260
It's the last pork bun for the road, though.

1831
02:13:19,400 --> 02:13:19,960
Please.

1832
02:13:20,500 --> 02:13:22,000
It's the last one.

1833
02:13:22,460 --> 02:13:25,160
How would I become a whole man?

1834
02:13:25,760 --> 02:13:28,160
Also, how the fuck do I get to the massage?

1835
02:13:30,940 --> 02:13:31,660
Where is it?

1836
02:13:31,680 --> 02:13:33,440
It's like locked up secretly.

1837
02:13:35,380 --> 02:13:37,120
I think it's because there's a cop here.

1838
02:13:39,140 --> 02:13:40,100
By bumping into him.

1839
02:13:40,160 --> 02:13:41,620
I don't think he'd like that.

1840
02:13:44,600 --> 02:13:45,360
What if I...

1841
02:13:46,140 --> 02:13:47,560
What's the closest ocean?

1842
02:13:51,460 --> 02:13:52,820
Wait, it's inside the mall?

1843
02:13:52,920 --> 02:13:53,660
Wait, there's a mall?

1844
02:13:54,820 --> 02:13:56,220
I don't know, there's a K bar here.

1845
02:13:58,200 --> 02:13:59,280
Oh, it's inside the K.

1846
02:13:59,340 --> 02:14:00,820
Oh, it's inside the K bar!

1847
02:14:01,020 --> 02:14:02,540
I forgot about the K-bar.

1848
02:14:03,580 --> 02:14:04,020
How could I...

1849
02:14:06,620 --> 02:14:07,580
Ever since...

1850
02:14:07,580 --> 02:14:09,300
How could I forget about the K-bar?

1851
02:14:09,500 --> 02:14:11,660
That's where I met the love of my life.

1852
02:14:11,880 --> 02:14:13,300
My fifth girlfriend.

1853
02:14:13,780 --> 02:14:14,020
One

1854
02:14:17,210 --> 02:14:22,650
last...

1855
02:14:22,650 --> 02:14:24,750
One last massage.

1856
02:14:26,830 --> 02:14:27,210
Hello.

1857
02:14:29,930 --> 02:14:30,890
Hey, stranger.

02:14:31,370 --> 02:14:33,310
Want to help me work out my fingers?

1859
02:14:34,210 --> 02:14:35,430
Sure, why not?

1860
02:14:35,970 --> 02:14:37,950

1861
02:14:38,130 --> 02:14:38,410
Oh.

1862
02:14:42,800 --> 02:14:44,880
One last massage.

Come again soon.

As always, everybody, stay hydrated, posture check.

1880
02:17:26,180 --> 02:17:27,120
Get up and move around.

1881
02:17:27,240 --> 02:17:28,200
Get that blood flowing.

1882
02:17:28,340 --> 02:17:31,840
And if you stay up for me, head to bed, cause you deserve it.

1883
02:17:32,220 --> 02:17:33,700
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

1884
02:17:34,080 --> 02:17:34,780
Bye, guys.

1885
02:17:35,860 --> 02:17:36,120
Bye!
