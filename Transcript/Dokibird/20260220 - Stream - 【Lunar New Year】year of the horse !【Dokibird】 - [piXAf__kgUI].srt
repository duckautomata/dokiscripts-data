00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,620

457
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:21,850
I knew I forgot something I got all oh, did you guys see the
um, did you guys see the new like viral tweet about like

458
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:27,610
body track like Like 3d tracking about actually wearing
anything that shit looks cool.

459
00:49:27,810 --> 00:49:30,910
I think I might look into that I mean like you know what's
crazy.

460
00:49:31,070 --> 00:49:32,610
It's cheaper than it's

461
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:38,110
That's for sure

462
00:49:42,450 --> 00:49:51,350
It's cheaper than dokeelan like Yeah, yeah, and it has it
comes with hand tracking which is great.

463
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:52,110
That's what I need

464
00:49:55,590 --> 00:50:03,430
Yeah, no, I really like get it for 7k Because my manager was
in talks with the people just to see I want to do a trial

465
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:10,650
run on it though I'm not sure if I actually I'm not sure yet
because like it's you know 3d is always improving and

466
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:23,450
everything um but i can get like a discount on it because my
manager was talking to the people uh uh yeah um and oh yeah

00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:55,090
oh yeah I fucked up my tradition you're supposed to not wash
your hair during um during lunar new year and then on the

491
00:51:55,090 --> 00:52:08,450
first day I washed I washed I went took a shower I already
fucked up I messed it up no I was so I felt I felt

492
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:17,230
disgusting um Yeah, because the thing about that is that,
oh, you see this, this is me like leaning on my, oh my gosh,

493
00:52:17,370 --> 00:52:18,210
I wish I could have better.

494
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:21,850
This is me like putting my hand on my face right now.

495
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:29,970
But tradition-wise, it's bad luck to take a shower during
Lunar New Year, because on the start of Lunar New Year is

496
00:52:29,970 --> 00:52:31,070
where all your luck comes in.

497
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:36,690
And if you take a shower during Lunar New Year, you're
washing away all the luck you just earned.

498
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:38,870
So that's why it's like super bad luck.

499
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:40,830
And I did on the first day.

500
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:44,130
because I was like, I forgot to take a shower the day before
it.

501
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:48,170
I was like, I feel disgusting.

502
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:56,590
And I had to go out too, because I wanted to, I wanted to go
out to celebrate Lunar New Year, and then so I was just

503
00:52:56,590 --> 00:53:02,010
like, alright, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I type don't feel, I
felt like disgusting, and I was just like, fuck it, alright.

504
00:53:02,290 --> 00:53:02,890
It's over.

505
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:04,910
It's over for me.

506
00:53:06,570 --> 00:53:08,830

00:56:08,830 --> 00:56:21,290
that it's like you know it's last like I saw two weeks left

537
00:56:37,790 --> 00:56:44,130
But yeah, no, I already fucked up the tradition, like, you
know, the number one, not the number one rule, but one of

538
00:56:44,130 --> 00:56:45,510
the rules is like, don't take a shower.

539
00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:55,470

cut it or something and heat it up um and uh and uh I like

542
00:57:13,710 --> 00:57:22,450
to pan fry it with because it's so good it's like if you
never tried sweet rice cake with egg it's so fucking good

Like I, you know how it's like you can only choose one or
the other?

557
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:09,090
You know, you know how it's like you choose one or you be
productive, have good sleep or have good growth.

You know, like have good grades, be active, or have good
sleep, and you can only choose two.

559
00:59:14,490 --> 00:59:24,170
Well, for me, um, it's either I get my life together, or I
feed my dragoons.

I don't want I don't want my FBI agent to look at me Makes
sense They can look at me through my phone.

582
01:01:52,050 --> 01:01:54,680
I just don't want them to look at me through my webcam, you
know

583
01:01:59,050 --> 01:02:02,510
Fair Hello, mr.

584
01:02:02,850 --> 01:02:13,370
FBI agent The phone I better angles on the phone not on the
webcam So I don't want them to look at me through If they

585
01:02:13,370 --> 01:02:19,470
want to look at me I better I know my angles on the phone
Not on the webcam

586
01:02:25,540 --> 01:02:38,100
Please read me a bit Yeah it's all about the angle Exactly
Yeah You know like You know like For those who own laptops I

587
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:46,340
was one of those people that put like a Put a sticky note on
the webcam Yeah that's right i ain't taking my chances

588
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:59,780
if my fbi agent is looking at me through my webcam i don't
trust them they have other ways to look at me same to be

589
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:08,120
honest no it's because my school gave us laptops well we
paid for them technically it was part of our tuition um

590
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:15,560
because i went to international school so um wait let me i
feel weird like looking there you go it's like i'm looking

591
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:27,720
at you guys now um so um so my school um at before it was it
was so fucked up so like um um my school we our tuition

592
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:35,580
includes like laptops and stuff so uh we each get our own
laptop for school and then is so fucked up because like the

593
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:46,620
year after the grade before us got apple got got apple max
by paying the same tuition our laptops were del and then

594
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:53,520
they got max and at that time max was like super popular
back then so then like obviously like you max but back then

595
01:03:53,520 --> 01:04:03,720
it was like there were more people were using max than um
dels and also i got a del so and then we were so they had a

596
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:11,920
apple party too that was the worst part because they're like
the the grade below us like you know like that year after we

597
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:17,260
just kept our lap we like you're like oh when you're at this
I think it was like I think it was sixth grade when you hit

598
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:24,740
sixth grade um when you hit sixth grade you get like a
laptop that's part of your tuition and then when the new

599
01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:30,820
sixth grade class came in they got Macs MacBooks and then
they literally held an apple party for them they had like a

600
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:39,420
little like celebration for the the new sixth graders be
like yay you guys got macbooks yeah

601
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:50,700
when they gave us they're just like here's your your shitty
Dell laptops and we're like okay and then for them they got

602
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:59,220
like a little fucking pizza party yeah fucking and you know
what's worse I swear I thought this was a conspiracy because

603
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:07,500
God was there that was like the principal's daughter was a
grade below us and then you know when she hit sixth grade

604
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:19,800
what a coincidence she got a MacBook like what a fucking
coincidence like wow she hit sixth grade and then somehow

605
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:25,580
they changed the process where now you all get MacBooks
instead

606
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:41,100
right um i forgot where the story was gonna go oh yeah yeah
but yeah when i got left i would just put like a little

607
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:47,180
sticky note tape i think i told the story before since we're
talking about the laptop thing actually broke the screen

608
01:05:47,180 --> 01:05:56,380
because uh in sixth grade uh we were not allowed to bring
our laptops home until um seventh grade or i think eighth

609
01:05:56,380 --> 01:06:01,500
grade i think it was like either eighth grade we were
allowed to bring our laptops home by the way like the laptop

610
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:08,060
supposed to last us all the way to high school um like end
of like end of the year so like they don't give us new

611
01:06:08,060 --> 01:06:17,260
laptops by the way this laptop was last us all the way till
we graduate in high school so um um but on sixth grade to

612
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:23,920
seventh grade we were not allowed to bring the laptops home
we had to put in this little cubby and then um and um

613
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:33,320
technically um we share it with our part where we actually
shared this laptop um with someone else technically i think

614
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:41,240
oh yeah i remember oh sorry i remember sixth grade uh for us
we had to share lap our laptops with someone else until

615
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:47,460
seventh grade where we got like each we get our own laptop
like you're like oh here's your own laptop so like in sixth

616
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:52,480
grade we share it by the way the new sixth graders they get
to keep their macbooks so that's why we're like wow they get

617
01:06:52,480 --> 01:07:05,160
to keep they don't have to share their macbooks and they get
anyway so in sixth grade I remember this um um basically oh

618
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:15,700
wait sorry yeah sixth grade when we're sharing our laptops
and stuff um um with like uh with like a partner from the

619
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:22,480
other class like we were all in sixth grade um because they
were split into two classes and um I actually broke my

620
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:31,020
screen because I like had something when I was closing my
laptop screen um I actually something in the screen so when

621
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:38,780
I was pushing it down the screen cracked and then you know
you would like you know the same thing to do is to tell the

622
01:07:38,780 --> 01:07:47,880
teacher being like I actually broke the glass but then I
didn't want my parents to pay for it the rational idea of

623
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:56,000
being like oh I'm sorry I broke actually it was an accident
so what I did instead was I broke the glass I closed that I

624
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:07,540
I closed the lid back and then I just put it in the shelf
and then I left and then the next day I got called in by the

625
01:08:07,540 --> 01:08:16,520
the the technology teacher or like the I don't know what
they're called the computer science teacher or whatever and

626
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:23,940
the tech support teacher and then she was like what had like
pulled me and my my other my partner the the person I shared

627
01:08:23,940 --> 01:08:27,980
my laptop with and they're like, I was like, oh, what
happened?

628
01:08:30,820 --> 01:08:32,920
You know, I got called, obviously I knew what happened.

629
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:36,200
Like, I got called in with my partner.

630
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:37,880
I was like, what happened?

631
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:39,060

632
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:40,660
Like, why, what's going on?

633
01:08:45,220 --> 01:08:48,820
And they're like, oh, he's like, did you know what happened
to our laptop?

634
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:49,800
The screen's cracked.

01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:50,780
I was like, what?

636
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:54,660
The screen was okay when I last saw it, put it there.

637
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:55,180
Are you sure?

638
01:08:55,180 --> 01:08:56,860
Like, are you sure it wasn't you?

639
01:08:57,260 --> 01:09:01,140
They're like, no, I went to grab it for this morning and it
was cracked.

640
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:05,940
Who broke our laptop?

641
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:12,200
I didn't want to get in trouble.

642
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:14,880
I, you know, how did that happen?

643
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:18,160
Like, I didn't want to get in trouble, okay?

644
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:21,380
I didn't want my parents to pay for it and I didn't get in
trouble.

645
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:27,260
Anyway, and then, and then, um, like, no way.

646
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:34,360
And then they're like, like she interrogated each of us
individually to figure out who was the one that was lying.

647
01:09:34,540 --> 01:09:36,280
Was it me or him?

648
01:09:36,780 --> 01:09:39,320
And then they're like, what happened?

649
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:43,860
And I was like, oh, I was just working on, I was working on
my classwork for science.

650
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:49,880
And then after, you know, after science class was done, I
just put the laptop back in the cubby and then I left, I

651
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:50,480

The one who got it.

671
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:37,060

hated her but the feeling was still there i is rubber i did

672
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:44,940
not like her and i don't remember why i hated her but the
hate is still there in my heart i might not remember why i

673
01:11:44,940 --> 01:11:55,460
hated her but it's the the hate transcends the memory um oh
yeah i was gonna say oh yeah uh oh bring the background

674
01:11:55,460 --> 01:12:07,320
music oh was the background music throughout it all right I

675
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:15,660
several teachers that made me angry um there was there's
other teacher that I hated he was a PE teacher I hated him

676
01:12:15,660 --> 01:12:29,460
so much so basically let me be a little closer I hated him a
lot because basically he took PE super fucking serious And

677
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:31,440
then he became the director of physical ed.

678
01:12:32,540 --> 01:12:38,320
He became the director of our sports program and also
physical education.

679
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:44,580
And I hated him because he would make us write essays and
stuff.

680
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:49,620
He would make us feel like a questionnaire slash mini essay
every week.

681
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:53,480
At the end of the week where we have to be like, what are
your goals?

682
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:54,500
Like, what are your goals?

683
01:12:54,740 --> 01:12:58,100
What are your plans for this week of physical education?

684
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:09,620
do to be um to like in like uh to achieve your goals for
this week for pe yeah no it's crazy it was like 10 questions

685
01:13:09,620 --> 01:13:15,640
and you have to write like like a paragraph for each
question and we have to do it for every week and i everyone

686
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:22,760
fucking hated because it's like pe like you know we're not
using our brains for fucking pe like we're here to like

687
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:33,460
sweat it out like i told this story before for those who are
new and never heard of the story before um basically um um i

688
01:13:33,460 --> 01:13:41,400
got called out during like his mini rant that he was doing
to his class uh during the class because like um you know i

689
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:48,700
was really i i was very athletic athletic back then and now
i'm just a vtuber so i just stay at home all the time and i

690
01:13:48,700 --> 01:14:01,240
get tired after going out for like one day up but basically
I got called out during his little mini rant about like

691
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:12,080
grades because it was mid report card season and a lot of
the students who were on the pathway to the honors to honors

692
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:18,680
had to like go talk to him personally and being like can you
please change my grade and stuff because I really want

693
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:27,520
because like it's really fucked up but the only way only
thing that was blocking people from getting honors PE

694
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:30,540
because he was such a harsh grader in PE.

695
01:14:31,020 --> 01:14:39,740
So the girls who are not good at PE were getting B's and
stuff because they write really good essays, but they're

696
01:14:39,740 --> 01:14:43,240
just not physical in the physical education part.

697
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:54,460
So they would go to his office hours to like beg him to like
fix their grades because literally PE was denying them

698
01:14:54,460 --> 01:15:02,660
honors the honors class like the getting into the honor
society um and getting recognized to be in the honors

699
01:15:02,660 --> 01:15:11,220
program and um and then during PE class he was talking about
him being like I'm grading very fairly you know like I can

700
01:15:11,220 --> 01:15:18,180
see if you're you know it's not if you're not you're not
good at PE like that's fine but I need to see you try you're

701
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:29,700
you're being graded like this and then he's like look at
doki over there you know you can see she actually trying in

702
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:38,180
pe but she doesn't she doesn't do well in the um in the
right written portion of it like i would have given her an a

703
01:15:38,180 --> 01:15:46,260
but she's not doing well and she doesn't um uh she doesn't
like excel in the written portion in physical edging in pe

704
01:15:46,260 --> 01:15:49,960
and that's why i give her a b plus and i'm like bro what the
fuck like

705
01:15:55,910 --> 01:16:05,690
I was just like what what the fuck like you could I I
wouldn't even go to your office hours to complain I didn't

706
01:16:05,690 --> 01:16:17,490
like I didn't fucking care like I got b plus I don't fucking
care like um and so like I got called out because they're

707
01:16:17,490 --> 01:16:25,030
like yeah she should get an a if we're a if we're like we're
focusing on the physical part of physical education but she

708
01:16:25,030 --> 01:16:27,850
didn't enough effort in a written portion.

709
01:16:28,070 --> 01:16:29,790
Now, fucking course I didn't put enough effort.

710
01:16:30,350 --> 01:16:30,830
It's PE.

711
01:16:31,050 --> 01:16:36,130
I'm gonna try to focus on English, English humanities,
science, and math.

712
01:16:36,310 --> 01:16:41,850
Like, if I have to write, I'm gonna write in humanities.

713
01:16:42,210 --> 01:16:44,210
Like, I'm not gonna fucking write in PE.

714
01:16:44,370 --> 01:16:45,110
I don't care.

715
01:16:45,450 --> 01:16:47,150
I read, like, one or two sentences.

716
01:16:47,370 --> 01:16:48,150
I'm done.

717
01:16:48,590 --> 01:16:48,810
Like,

718
01:16:53,410 --> 01:16:53,850
yeah.

719
01:16:54,130 --> 01:16:55,830
So I was just like, bro, fuck that.

720
01:16:55,850 --> 01:17:07,550
shit like like I didn't use my brain for the actual written
portions that matter I just show up to PE like I clock in

721
01:17:07,550 --> 01:17:22,150
and I clock out yeah like I'm here the min max bro I'm
fucking min maxing right now um who has a bro that's why I

722
01:17:22,150 --> 01:17:30,910
hated this p teacher so much i hated him and he was and then
he got promoted he got like everyone hated him like every

723
01:17:30,910 --> 01:17:40,630

got promoted to director of the athletic program like the

727
01:18:03,930 --> 01:18:12,270
cucking students from the honors like from getting honors

728
01:18:12,270 --> 01:18:18,270
make him change his grade and he would be put his foot down
be like it's not my fault your your your daughter slash son

759
01:21:57,120 --> 01:22:02,800
that they're like they they're selling the written portion
but it's not on them that they're like they're not like as

760
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:09,320
athletic as the other students so like and they were like
crying being like coming to like it was during like recess

761
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:14,720
or what like reading break um and we would just be in the
library because his office his office was near the library

762
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:20,620
and then like i would see like girls coming out of his
office hours literally cry like just crying and stuff

763
01:22:20,620 --> 01:22:27,560
because he won't change their grades or like give them an
opportunity like let them do extra credit to like um let

764
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:37,480
them have like get an a or some shit yeah yeah that's why
like i fucking hated him like everyone hated him i was like

765
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:43,860
that's just so messed up like like it's like it's not their
fault it's not their fault they're not like as of like

766
01:22:43,860 --> 01:22:49,620
they're not as athletic as the other students like like
they're trying their best but they're like he was like i

767
01:22:49,620 --> 01:22:56,180
could tell when you are trying your best and like from what
i see you are not trying your best so you get a beat like

768
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:02,180
Yeah, let me recalibrate real quick.

769
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:06,640
This is the only issue I have with this is that you gotta
recalibrate very often.

770
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:16,520
if I, because like, it's like moving around the trackers and
everything, so I have to recalibrate it often.

771
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:23,260
I just don't understand how...

772
01:23:23,260 --> 01:23:24,380

especially, like, you know, I was like, 13th, there's
nothing really special on the 13th, you know, and so, like,

857
01:31:53,000 --> 01:32:00,740
I was doing my laundry, and then literally, I only had one
clean shirt, and then the only clean shirt I had was, it was

said, I want money.

Oh, ta-da!

941
01:39:48,830 --> 01:39:52,050
It's not mirrored, so it's like, like, it throws me off.

942
01:39:52,710 --> 01:39:55,230
I mean, it is mirrored, so it throws me off a lot.

943
01:39:56,630 --> 01:40:00,250
Let me grab it real quick.

944
01:40:02,630 --> 01:40:03,910
Grab the concept art.

945
01:40:06,230 --> 01:40:07,170
It just fucks me.

946
01:40:07,190 --> 01:40:09,290
with my mind when it's like mirrored.

947
01:40:09,530 --> 01:40:11,010
I'm not used to it.

948
01:40:11,230 --> 01:40:14,530
My right hand is my left hand and I'm like that ain't right.

949
01:40:15,050 --> 01:40:20,770
Oh yes, members, members, there is a special Lunar New Year
wallpaper that will be showing tomorrow.

950
01:40:21,030 --> 01:40:25,890
So if you are a member, you will get a special Lunar New
Year wallpaper.

951
01:40:28,430 --> 01:40:29,470
Members wallpaper.

952
01:40:30,430 --> 01:40:33,550
It's by the same artist, but you get two wallpapers
technically.

953
01:40:43,670 --> 01:40:56,790
where the fuck is the concept art give me a sec I'm trying
to find the concept art of this oh there it is

954
01:41:00,180 --> 01:41:17,280
all right so this is the concept art of the lunar year
outfit it's pretty fire look I think it's one of my favorite

955
01:41:17,540 --> 01:41:19,020
voice pack outfits so far.

956
01:41:20,380 --> 01:41:20,420
Yeah!

957
01:41:21,100 --> 01:41:26,960
So this is the outfit design for for the Lunar New Year
voice pack.

958
01:41:27,580 --> 01:41:30,100
And I speak Cantonese in the voice pack too, by the way.

959
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:32,580
Little incentive, guys.

960
01:41:32,740 --> 01:41:33,480
I mean, one more...

961
01:41:33,480 --> 01:41:36,080
I know some of you guys are like, we need more Cantonese
doki.

962
01:41:36,200 --> 01:41:38,200
I do speak Cantonese in the voice pack.

963
01:41:39,160 --> 01:41:43,240
But this is the concept art for the voice pack.

964
01:41:44,380 --> 01:41:45,800
It's one of my favorite outfits so far.

965
01:41:45,880 --> 01:41:46,680
It looks so sick.

966
01:41:47,540 --> 01:41:53,840
I just love everything about it, like the little patterns
and the bullet on the thigh and everything.

967
01:41:53,960 --> 01:41:54,740
There's the gun.

968
01:41:55,180 --> 01:41:58,400
My little purse to store my gun.

969
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,380
It's pretty good.

970
01:42:03,940 --> 01:42:06,560
Oh yeah, this stream is not sponsored by PUBG.

971
01:42:06,820 --> 01:42:07,360
I got...

972
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:09,080
I just realized I was playing.

973
01:42:09,460 --> 01:42:13,500
I mean, like, the stream is not sponsored by PUBG, by the
way.

974
01:42:13,940 --> 01:42:16,820
That's been over for a while now.

975
01:42:18,680 --> 01:42:20,380

01:42:20,720 --> 01:42:21,920

01:42:25,220 --> 01:42:26,620
Let me fix that.

979
01:42:28,520 --> 01:42:28,960
Alright.

980
01:42:29,660 --> 01:42:30,960

01:42:34,140 --> 01:42:35,660
Wait, everything else is turned off.

01:44:29,470 --> 01:44:32,070
Just let it, just shave it off.

1000
01:44:35,630 --> 01:44:37,610
Just shave it off.

1001
01:44:37,770 --> 01:44:38,510
There's no point.

1002
01:44:41,910 --> 01:44:48,190
I think it's like funny though that he's actually going...
Oh yeah, and also another news, another gaming news.

1003
01:44:50,270 --> 01:45:00,630
um apparently snake is at is in rainbow six siege now and
then i message min about it and then she was like no don't

1004
01:45:00,630 --> 01:45:08,830
do this to me and i literally was like you don't want to
play rainbow six siege i was like don't do it it's not worth

1005
01:45:08,830 --> 01:45:20,290
it and then and then i was like it's don't do it it's not
worth it and then she's like I'm so scared of being called 1

1006
01:45:20,290 --> 01:45:34,350
million slurs on my stream and I was like but that's the
siege experience oh yeah speaking of voice um speaking of

1007
01:45:34,350 --> 01:45:43,390
voice comms league is apparently testing out planning on
testing out bc comms voice chat in league uh for their next

1008
01:45:43,390 --> 01:45:49,290
like beta or some shit they're planning on testing it out
And I'm like, that is the biggest mistake they'll ever do.

1009
01:45:49,510 --> 01:45:50,490
Like, there's no way.

1010
01:45:50,790 --> 01:45:56,750
There's no way they should ever release voice chat for
League of Legends.

1011
01:45:57,110 --> 01:45:57,450
That shit.

1012
01:45:58,910 --> 01:46:03,630
You can't even say jump.

1013
01:46:06,550 --> 01:46:14,030
Apparently you can get, if you type it in text, if you type
jump in text, you can actually get warned.

1014
01:46:17,130 --> 01:46:30,850
so so it's like like how are you gonna monitor that shit
like text chat is already so fucking bad oh yeah and also by

1015
01:46:30,850 --> 01:46:40,490
the way for those who don't know um also uh overwatch is
also planning on giving you voice comms um which is crazy

1016
01:46:40,490 --> 01:46:49,950
over by the way for those who don't know um wait let me for
those For those who don't know, Oroosh is also planning on

1017
01:46:49,950 --> 01:46:52,330
adding voice comms at the end of the match.

1018
01:46:52,470 --> 01:46:55,450
And I'm like, that's definitely not going to go wrong, is
it?

1019
01:46:55,970 --> 01:47:04,510
Like, yeah, so they're planning on making it so at the end
of the match, you could talk to the enemy team.

1020
01:47:04,790 --> 01:47:09,050
And I can't wait for all the nice things they're going to
say to me at the end of the game.

1021
01:47:12,210 --> 01:47:12,930
Like, yeah.

1022
01:47:15,010 --> 01:47:23,810

the end of the game yeah i was like bro why are all these

companies like dude do they not know what kind of audience
they have playing video games like bro we're all toxic

1024
01:47:35,230 --> 01:47:41,150
there's no hiding it what what is this revision of history

01:48:29,490 --> 01:48:31,030
What's that famous quote?

1034
01:48:34,110 --> 01:48:35,670
Yeah, history is doomed.

1035
01:48:36,930 --> 01:48:40,170
Is those who do not study history are doomed to repeat it.

1036
01:48:44,490 --> 01:48:56,150
yes that's it oh my god everyone all the streamers are gonna
