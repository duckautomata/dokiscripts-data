1
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,480
Wait, where am I?

2
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,540
Why am I not on the screen?

3
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,560
Oh, there I am!

4
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,640
What a way to start.

5
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Where am I?

6
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:00,240
I feel like a fucking lost grandparent.

7
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:04,290
Being like, kids, where is Grand Doki?

8
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,200
Oh my god, let me turn down.

9
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,080
Great news.

10
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,620
I'm turning down Void.

11
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,140
I'm turning down the voices for the next game.

12
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,700
Oh my god, the golden kappa train?

13
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,580
Wait, isn't that rare?

14
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,540
Guys, we hit the rare golden kappa!

15
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,040
Night train!

16
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,680
That's rare, right?

17
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,880
Oh my god, we've been blessed.

18
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:39,780
We've been blessed today for day four of the Minecraft Twitch Rivals.

19
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,740
They have blessed us.

20
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:48,320
Also, Sound Guide, if you're here, I'm gonna need you to let me know if the sound's gonna be, like, messed up or not.

21
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,520
Guys, okay, here's some updates.

22
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,820
Oh my god, thank you!

23
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,700
Oh my god!

24
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,740
That's so many!

25
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:55,940
Oh!

26
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,700
So many subs!

27
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,780
Thank you, everybody!

28
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,160
PTD, thank you for the five gifted subs!

29
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,500
Oh, it's so many!

30
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,580
It's golden kappa!

31
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,640
It's your time to get a golden kappa!

32
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,120
Thank you for the biddies, Meki!

33
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,280
Okay, after I get eliminated, I'll thank everybody.

34
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,160
I'll pull up the list.

35
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,020
I don't have the list.

36
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,120
It's not a hit list.

37
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,240
It's not a hit list.

38
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,840
It's, like, the list of people who gifted and, like, subbed and all that stuff.

39
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,540
I don't have it up right now.

40
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:35,620
But after we get eliminated in, like, the doll game, I'll pull it up, because it's going so fast.

41
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,620
Next thing, thank you for the five gifted subs!

42
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,640
Thank you, thank you!

43
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,020
And Karin, thank you for the 200 biddies!

44
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,220
Alright, guys.

45
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,320
This is crazy.

46
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,300
This is actually crazy.

47
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:53,600
But after the stream ended, and for three... I think for, like, four hours, they kept arguing.

48
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,580
It was...

49
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:07,680
I think for, like, four to five hours after we thought it was over, people reignited the argument in the Discord chat.

50
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,260
Like, they... It was actually insane.

51
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,160
Because, like, you know what happened?

52
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,980
One of the admins posted an update.

53
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,660
And then it reignited the conversation.

54
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,260
And then they started pulling up, like, actually rules and stuff.

55
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:35,480
They're like, you said in this rule that players who don't... who choose to not... who choose... don't follow the rules because they were ignorant doesn't count.

56
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,760
And then they pulled that rule... Wait, let me get... pull it up.

57
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,900
Because it was so funny.

58
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,040
Oh my...

59
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,160
I read that, and it was so funny.

60
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,620
I was like, oh my god!

61
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,020
Okay, let me... I need to see this again.

62
00:04:54,200 --> 00:05:00,200
Because it was... it was actually... I... I was like, what the heck?

63
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:01,720
Like...

64
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,020
Okay, being... This is a real rule, by the way.

65
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,800
Being unaware of the rules does not exempt participants from elimination.

66
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,900
Organizers reserve the right to enforce rules and take necessary actions.

67
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,740
So that is like a legit rule in the server for the game.

68
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,380
So then somebody took that and was like, why does this not apply now?

69
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,980
So people... and then everyone was like, wait, you're right!

70
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,820
So people took that rule to, like, use it against the admins.

71
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,760
Because they're like, you wrote this rule!

72
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:46,180
So those players who were unaware of those rules should not...

73
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,720
should not exempt participants.

74
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:52,420
I was just like, why are we drag... Bro!

75
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,920
Bro, it's day five!

76
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,960
Day four now!

77
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,140
Why are we dragging this back up?

78
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,620
I thought we all agreed!

79
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,660
I thought all of us agreed on it!

80
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,380
What do you mean?

81
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:12,140
The arguments ended at, like, um, 8pm.

82
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,680
Everybody stopped arguing at 8pm.

83
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:28,100
Because the admins dropped the rules for, uh, they dropped the rules for, like, um, game... what was it?

84
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,940
Game six and seven?

85
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,460
Okay, wait, is it six and seven?

86
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,980
Yeah, yeah, they dropped the rules for game six.

87
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,680
Oh my gosh!

88
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:40,400
There's a specific... I don't even know if we're gonna make it to the second game today.

89
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:47,200
Because the first game today is, um, the first game is going to be the doll game.

90
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,520
Our favorite game, by the way.

91
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,720
It's gonna be the doll game.

92
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:59,160
Um, there's gonna be no time limit, and it only stops each round, um, after six players are eliminated.

93
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:06,320
So, like, yeah, each doll... the doll has to eliminate six players, and there's no time limit until six players are dead.

94
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,080
And then we go to the second round.

95
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,380
Until 30 players are eliminated in the end.

96
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:16,460
So we're going until 30 players are eliminated, so that we have 40 players left in the game.

97
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:20,860
Yeah, so, like, each doll... each round has at least six eliminations.

98
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,840
So, um, or at most six eliminations.

99
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,580
So, like, that's how they're gonna...

100
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,880
They removed the safe dolls!

101
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,180
Yay!

102
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,700
Finally, they removed the safe dolls.

103
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,700
Because there was no point.

104
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:42,120
Apparently the safe dolls was, like, it was bad to hit the safe dolls.

105
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,340
Then why the heck were they called safe?

106
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,400
If it was so bad, why did you name the safe dolls safe?

107
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:55,440
Because the safe dolls actually made the cursed dolls faster.

108
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:00,600
So when you hit the safe dolls, you're just making the cursed dolls move faster.

109
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,820
So I was like, wait, then it shouldn't be called safe.

110
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,020
Like, what?

111
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,940
That, like, messed me up.

112
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,860
That, like, actually messed me up.

113
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,740
I was like, wait, what's the point then?

114
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,340
Why did they call it safe?

115
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,840
Okay, let's, like, mute.

116
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,060
I don't want to listen to the voices today.

117
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:21,780
For now.

118
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,920
We'll listen to the voices when we have to run.

119
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,760
So they removed it.

120
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,340
Oh my god.

121
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,660
Golden Kappa level 12!

122
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,520
Thank you for the level 12 Kappa Twain!

123
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:36,160
Okay, I, like, wrote down everything I wanted to say today about the updates.

124
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:36,840
Alright.

125
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,140
Okay.

126
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:49,380
And then, after they dropped the new rules, after they dropped the new rules, all the pro Minecraft players started theorycrafting and talking about, like, infinite sprint jobs.

127
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,940
And then I'm like, what the heck is infinity?

128
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,900
They're like, can we do infinity sprint jump?

129
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,100
And I'm like, what the what words are they speaking?

130
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,260
Excuse me.

131
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:17,400
And then, cause the second game, like, there's no point in explaining the second game, because I don't even know about Bro, the dolls are gonna kill six people, like, for a round.

132
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,700
Like, 30 people are gonna get eliminated.

133
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:31,980
So, um, all I'm saying is, like, there's no point in me explaining the second game when there's a, like, I feel like, the moment I'm eliminated, everybody's just gonna be like, oh, hey, and then turn off.

134
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,820
So, true.

135
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,140
True.

136
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:55,980
And so, um, um, so I'm not gonna explain the second game until until, like, if I survive the second game, I'll explain it.

137
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:09,760
But, the second game, all I'm saying, when they the second game, so, like, we have, like, a daily itinerary, and like, they post a daily they post a daily itinerary for, like, every game, but it's like, it's all in one post.

138
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,100
But the second game had its very own channel.

139
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:22,060
Because the rules, I thought, like, the last game, the prop hunt game, had a lot of rules.

140
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:36,440
But the second game today had its own channel, and then it had its own separate FAQ channel, because everybody was asking questions, and I was just like, oh my god.

141
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:41,000
I was just reading it, and I'm like, why am I reading this?

142
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,620
I don't even know I'm gonna make it this far.

143
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:44,460
Why?

144
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:50,260
Why am I reading the friggin' FAQ itinerary for this?

145
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,100
Yeah.

146
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:57,500
So, like, so I just stopped reading, because I was like, why am I even reading this?

147
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,540
Like, I don't even know if I'm gonna get there.

148
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:06,820
So people were, like, asking, like, FAQ about, like, what can we do?

149
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,800
And what can we not do?

150
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,700
And stuff.

151
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,980
But it was just, it was so interesting.

152
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:20,840
Just, like, seeing all the Minecraft pros just, like, trying to see what they can, like, I guess, like, exploit, type deal.

153
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,800
And for, like, an easier game.

154
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:31,680
Like, what separates from a, um, an actual Minecraft player from a, from, you know, random VTuber number 13.

155
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,560
So, it was pretty funny.

156
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,800
I was just, like, reading it.

157
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,080
I'm like, what the heck?

158
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:47,920
I'm, like, reading the general chat to see all these people talking about the Minecraft tech.

159
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,640
And, like, talking about what they can and can't do.

160
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,660
And stuff like that.

161
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,280
And I'm just like, what's going on?

162
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,140
Oh my god.

163
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,040
No, it's, I, I, it's crazy.

164
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:11,400
I didn't realize how, how, like, how complicated Minecraft and also Minecraft drama can be.

165
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,060
You know, I've always read about the, like, the Minecraft stuff.

166
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:20,640
But being in the thick of it and listening to, like, the conversations, I was like, wow.

167
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,240
Oh my god.

168
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:29,940
At this point of stage, one of the pro players for an FPS game will start saying slurs.

169
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:30,800
But wow.

170
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,240
And then, and then they get dropped by their org.

171
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,220
But wow.

172
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,080
This is, wow.

173
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,440
I'm, I don't know what's going on.

174
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,760
Like, what they're saying really.

175
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,840
But, like, wow.

176
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,180
Wait.

177
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,300
They're still arguing about yesterday?

178
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,700
Oh my gosh.

179
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:52,000
No.

180
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,340
I, like, saw some of the tweets of, like, the fans.

181
00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:02,860
And, like, I was, like, I saw, I saw some of the tweets on both sides.

182
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,020
And from the, the things that, the trending part.

183
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,960
Cause I was, like, wondering, like, wait.

184
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,800
Are they like, against or for any of the people supporting?

185
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,700
I was, like, whoa.

186
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,740
I was, like, oh my god.

187
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,440
So how old are these fans again?

188
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,020
I'm sorry.

189
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:23,400
I shouldn't.

190
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,260
That was a low blow.

191
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,820
That was, I'm sorry, Minecraft community.

192
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,320
But, like, that was, that was a low blow.

193
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:37,860
I was, like, I'm just, like, how old are, how old are these children?

194
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:42,420
Like, low blow but not wrong.

195
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:43,960
No, no.

196
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:55,720
If you've seen some of the screen, like, not the screenshots, but, like, when you drag the fans into the argument and then you see the fans arguing for you on either side, you know, for either side.

197
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,600
I'm not saying, like, one side or the other.

198
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,580
Like, I'm for, for either side.

199
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,580
I thought it was really funny as an outsider.

200
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:07,580
As an outsider, I thought it was really funny.

201
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,140
.

202
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:15,920
It was actually, if you've seen the tweets, you would know what I mean.

203
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:19,000
Um, if you've seen the tweets.

204
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,060
But, yeah, anyway.

205
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,840
Yeah, that's, like, the Minecraft update for the day.

206
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,620
There's stuff that I wrote down.

207
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,300
Oh, yeah.

208
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,020
Oh, yeah.

209
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,680
Also, like, they were, like, oh, my gosh.

210
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:37,500
I mean, to be fair, it is $70,000 and, like, people were like, I didn't realize people were, like, VOD reviewing.

211
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:42,940
Like, they were VOD reviewing their competition to, like, find weakness.

212
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:47,380
Like, I was like, wait, this is, like, Apex scrims or Overwatch scrims.

213
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:51,820
They were legit VOD reviewing their opponents to see, like, the text they were using.

214
00:14:51,860 --> 00:15:00,360
Cause, like, you know how I'm in the ultimate hardcore The ultimate hardcore Minecraft server.

215
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:20,740
Like, um, so, like, I know, I realized they were actually, like, VOD reviewing like, their competitors to, like, see the tech and stuff and, like, see, like, you know, what they're using and, like, trying to, um, to, like, gather knowledge and, like, see the weakness and stuff like that.

216
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,380
What do you think, guys?

217
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,880
I don't even have a name to them.

218
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,200
Like, they don't even give me a name.

219
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:31,880
Like, what do you think?

220
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:32,680
Like...

221
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,420
Um, and it was I was like, oh my god.

222
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,180
Like, to be fair, it is 70k.

223
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,600
It is 70k.

224
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,740
It's life-changing money.

225
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,760
Um, so, like, to some of the people here.

226
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:52,420
So, it's like, um, and it's life-changing money to some of the people here, but it's also just, like, you know, bragging rights to some of the people here.

227
00:15:52,620 --> 00:16:00,300
For some of the people, cause, like, I don't know if you guys know this, but, like, if you're a really popular Minecraft creator, you can make a lot of money.

228
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,320
You can essentially be a million there.

229
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:07,320
So, like, for others, it's just bragging rights.

230
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,360
For others.

231
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,180
Um...

232
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,140
Is drops enabled?

233
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,300
Can I, like, lie about Like...

234
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,920
Can I just be like, yes.

235
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,880
Toki, no.

236
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,380
Um...

237
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,140
Uh, I mean, how with the children, though?

238
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,520
How with the children?

239
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,600
I don't know.

240
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,180
I don't know if drops are on.

241
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,680
How do I set up drops?

242
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,980
Alright, guys, let me look at my... I still have time.

243
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,140
How do I set up drops?

244
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,480
Uh...

245
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,160
Oh, drops!

246
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,480
Where's the Minecraft one?

247
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,380
Do I even get the Minecraft drop?

248
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,080
Wait, is there a Minecraft drop?

249
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,300
Oh, my God.

250
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,440
All I see is, like, was it the tank one?

251
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:04,300
Okay.

252
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,760
Wait, why don't I get the drop?

253
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,720
I'm in this event.

254
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,160
Wait a minute.

255
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,040
I don't even get this drop, but I'm in this event!

256
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,320
Wait, guys, I lied.

257
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,640
I totally...

258
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,680
Guys, I totally have drops, guys.

259
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,620
It's been four days.

260
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:17,880
I can't...

261
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,340
Guys!

262
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,560
I have drops, guys.

263
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,900
I have... I have...

264
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,000
I 100% have drops, guys.

265
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:27,940
Trust me.

266
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,020
Um...

267
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:30,700
Truth.

268
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:36,780
Also, like, the Spanish community saw my clip of the grave-spinning thing.

269
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,200
No shit!

270
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,500
What do you mean?

271
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,980
I don't know what you're talking about.

272
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:47,620
Look!

273
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:48,820
Look!

274
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,320
I...

275
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,760
I assumed since I played...

276
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,020
Look, I didn't check, but, like, since I assumed, since, like, I already...

277
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,160
I'm already in four days.

278
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,540
I was the number one Minecraft in Minecraft streamer for, like, two...

279
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,300
an hour straight.

280
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,420
Okay, guys?

281
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,580
So I assumed I would get drops.

282
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,540
And also because I made it to day four, chat.

283
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,700
So, like, if I don't actually have drops, that's not my fault.

284
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,060
That's Twitch's fault.

285
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,440
Bite the hand that feeds you.

286
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,840
I'm dragging Twitch down with me.

287
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:23,680
I...

288
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,260
I shouldn't have to ask for it, guys.

289
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:34,780
All I'm saying though is I shouldn't have to ask about the Twitch drop.

290
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,120
Anyway.

291
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:41,580
So if anybody comes in here asking about Twitch drop, just say yes.

292
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,380
Just say yes.

293
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,180
Because the blame is not on me if we don't have it.

294
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,420
I'm so scared.

295
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:49,720
Gosh.

296
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,740
I'm so anxious now.

297
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,780
I bought myself a cookie from Subway.

298
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,200
Because I...

299
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,600
I was so anxious from...

300
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,060
from this game mode.

301
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,560
I hate the dolls...

302
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,180
I hate the dolls game mode so much.

303
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:13,500
I think the dolls game mode is my most hated game mode.

304
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:18,440
Because that shit makes you even more anxious because everybody is screaming.

305
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,080
That's the worst part.

306
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:24,220
When everybody is screaming and you don't know what's going on.

307
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,740
So, like, you're, like, even more freaked out.

308
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:28,420
.

309
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,680
When the voices take over.

310
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:34,260
When the voices take over.

311
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:34,260
Yeah.

312
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:35,600
Yeah.

313
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:38,980
When the voices take over and you're just like, please.

314
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,880
I turned down the voice for everybody.

315
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,280
By a lot.

316
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,460
Oh yeah, I should turn up Goomy.

317
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,540
I need to find Goomy on here.

318
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,860
Because my sound guy was just like, just turn up Goomy and turn everybody down since you talk to her the most.

319
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,100
I was like, that's so smart.

320
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,020
Oh no.

321
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:55,940
Oh no, it's V.

322
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,380
Hannah, do you have all the eggs?

323
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,220
No, I only have 35.

324
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,900
Alright, we'll turn her up.

325
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,280
Alright.

326
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,260
Because then that makes sense though.

327
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,280
That actually makes sense.

328
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,600
I have the map of where they all are.

329
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,280
Yeah.

330
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,940
But yeah, that's the update for today.

331
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,940
If we live past the...

332
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:16,860
If we live past the dolls event, then like, God is real.

333
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,880
God is real.

334
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,760
And they try to play a sick joke at me.

335
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,760
What if you don't know?

336
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,320
No way!

337
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,400
All I'm saying is, if I live...

338
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,720
This is me.

339
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,700
Oh my God, this is me.

340
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,800
The last three remaining D's.

341
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,700
The last three D's of everywhere here.

342
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,600
If...

343
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,520
If I don't live past the dolls event, then there is a possibility.

344
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,460
There is a poss...

345
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,180
I can't just say God is not real.

346
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,120
Because...

347
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,640
I don't want to get into that right now.

348
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,120
There is a possibility.

349
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,020
Okay.

350
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:17,820
Alright.

351
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:24,720
Okay, I hope Gumi lives and I get eliminated, so I don't get dragged into Valorant.

352
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,780
Because she'll be too busy playing the next game.

353
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,280
That's like all I hope for.

354
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,120
That's all I hope for.

355
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,340
That's all I want.

356
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:38,540
True!

357
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,620
That is the key escape plan.

358
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,200
Gumi, Gumi, Gumi!

359
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,300
Bye, boy!

360
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:48,900
Bye, boy!

361
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,300
Uh-huh!

362
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,140
Bye!

363
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:54,820
I can't do that!

364
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,080
I can't do that!

365
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,960
I can't hear a lot of things.

366
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:00,920
I'm scared!

367
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,280
Are you alive?

368
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,420
My arms are numb!

369
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,240
Are you not alive?

370
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,500
I am!

371
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,520
But people were like, oh, Donkey's not alive!

372
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,700
I got one guide!

373
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,640
Imagine getting one guide!

374
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,140
I got one guide.

375
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,480
I was worried for you, okay?

376
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,140
I got one guide, I was worried for you!

377
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,720
One, two, Freddy's coming for you.

378
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,000
I'm ready.

379
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,700
I hope you make it to the next round, Gumi, and then I get eliminated.

380
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,700
I hope I don't.

381
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,540
Why not?

382
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,020
Did you not see the next game?

383
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,100
It sounds so fun!

384
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,840
It had its own channel and everything!

385
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:35,560
Yeah!

386
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,540
I saw it!

387
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,380
Yeah, I saw it!

388
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,660
I also was like, wow!

389
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:45,560
I was like, wow, what happened to the RNG factors so that anybody can win?

390
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,160
They want VTuber out!

391
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,540
They want me out!

392
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,260
They tried to get me out!

393
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,520
It's so hard to get me out!

394
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,620
What happened to that?

395
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,600
I was like, looking at it, I was like, wait, I thought, I thought they would, now it's all skill!

396
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:01,400
Woah!

397
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:02,680
Woah!

398
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:03,740
It's ten minutes!

399
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,780
Okay, here!

400
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,500
Ten minutes is crazy!

401
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,200
Oh my god, alright.

402
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:13,680
Also, yes, the next two games are all skill-based.

403
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,840
Heavily Minecraft skill-based.

404
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,200
So I was like, what happened?

405
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,660
What happened to the RNG?

406
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,800
I thought...

407
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,680
I thought...

408
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,400
Woah!

409
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,300
What if the other people come into the corner?

410
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,220
Happy pride!

411
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:35,880
Happy pride!

412
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,040
Happy pride!

413
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,600
Oh my god, okay, let me...

414
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,500
I don't... other?

415
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,100
Wait, does that mean like...

416
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,020
the volume of any sound?

417
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,740
Oh, not listed below!

418
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:48,980
Okay.

419
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:55,340
This is bad EV, bro.

420
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,280
I'm not playing here.

421
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,160
This is the only way.

422
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,800
There's no all button!

423
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,440
That's so messed up!

424
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,440
Who are these people?

425
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:07,880
What do you think about...

426
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,580
There's no all button.

427
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:13,520
I have to manually do this myself.

428
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:17,020
I thought other was all!

429
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,140
But other are the things that are not in here.

430
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,920
Like, what is...

431
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,060
Are you kidding me?

432
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,320
Okay.

433
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,140
Wait, I have an idea.

434
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:33,560
God, it's not players.

435
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,200
It's not players.

436
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,040
What are they?

437
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:40,400
What are they?

438
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:44,580
Who are they?

439
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,440
Who are they?

440
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,300
Okay.

441
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:47,900
F.

442
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,380
I'll do all the F's.

443
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,440
We're all the F's.

444
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:05,480
Wait, how are they still going?

445
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,540
It's gonna be 60 next...

446
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,640
Oh, my God.

447
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,160
It doesn't push the ball.

448
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,740
Who is it?

449
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:16,380
Who is it?

450
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,020
Who is it?

451
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,400
I need to know their names.

452
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,040
Okay.

453
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,380
I see the names.

454
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,720
I see the names.

455
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:22,360
Oh!

456
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,860
I see the names.

457
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,160
I'm on the main screen.

458
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,580
Oh, well, the main screen's gonna see me be toxic right now.

459
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:37,300
This is the most interesting combination of three people to be singing three lines.

460
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,600
What do you mean?

461
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,120
Okay.

462
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:44,900
Okay, there you go.

463
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,200
I love that, guys.

464
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:46,800
Alright.

465
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,240
Oh, my God.

466
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,760
Oh, my God.

467
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,140
It feels so nice.

468
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,580
Okay, Sage is okay.

469
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,420
She's okay.

470
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,540
I'm not unmuting that.

471
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,300
I don't care what they say.

472
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:09,500
I don't care what anybody says.

473
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,300
Sylvie's okay.

474
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,920
Sylvie's okay.

475
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,480
If I don't know them, I'm also...

476
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:19,560
If I don't know them, I'm also...

477
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:19,680
Oh, wait.

478
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,540
The admins don't even talk.

479
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,580
Oh, I've muted some players.

480
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,620
By that, I mean...

481
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,700
Did you get out yesterday?

482
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,240
I did.

483
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:32,060
I got dropped four times in a row and then got counted up four rounds.

484
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,080
I could hear you.

485
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,240
I could hear you.

486
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,020
You're second chance.

487
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,820
I care a little bit.

488
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,300
Okay, I dare you to reveal the players.

489
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:44,880
Oh, yeah.

490
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,860
Alright, I got my jersey on.

491
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,500
We're gonna win now.

492
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:52,240
You know how the lights turn off?

493
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,600
You know what I mean?

494
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,380
When they start?

495
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:59,040
I think the second they TP you, I think you can still move.

496
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,660
Oh, I tried.

497
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,520
I tried that yesterday.

498
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:02,760
Did it work?

499
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,980
It did, but I still do it nonetheless just to get a head start of everyone.

500
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,760
Yeah, I'm gonna try and like walk backwards.

501
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,900
Why did you do that Wolfie video?

502
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,300
Further away from the goal, you know what I mean?

503
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:18,980
Tech, guys.

504
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:19,700
Minecraft tech.

505
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,560
We're stealing intel.

506
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,020
We're stealing intel.

507
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,020
It wasn't like a bet or something?

508
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,960
No, Wolfie.

509
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:35,020
Oh, literally when you just walked up to me I lowered every single person's volume.

510
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,420
Except the people I really know well.

511
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,440
That's so smart!

512
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,220
I don't know anybody!

513
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,920
I don't know anybody!

514
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,940
comp size is still important, but not important enough for me to get ahead.

515
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,060
You wanna be on it?

516
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:51,740
You wanna be on it?

517
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,300
But that's so smart!

518
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,680
But I don't know anybody!

519
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:56,900
Okay.

520
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,500
Okay, 5UP has been giving good intel.

521
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,500
So I'll keep 5UP up.

522
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:03,820
So I'll keep 5UP up.

523
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,260
I don't know anybody else.

524
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,300
Good luck.

525
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,940
I hope you survive to the next round.

526
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,700
I love you!

527
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,420
I love you!

528
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,600
Happy surprise!

529
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,440
You'll save me, right Gumi?

530
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,300
You'll make sure I won't die, right?

531
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,320
Anyways.

532
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:32,020
I will be on the opposite side.

533
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,300
Of everybody.

534
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:33,860
Wait, wait, wait!

535
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:34,800
There's more!

536
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:40,180
I will be wherever nobody is.

537
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:42,980
So we don't hear the voices.

538
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,240
It doesn't matter.

539
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:47,600
All I'm saying is that it doesn't matter.

540
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,960
We all get randomly TP'd.

541
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:58,940
We all get randomly TP'd somewhere.

542
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,180
So it doesn't matter.

543
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:01,440
So it doesn't matter.

544
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:04,580
Hello!

545
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,160
Come to my color!

546
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,020
It doesn't matter!

547
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,340
See?

548
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:16,660
It's green!

549
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,800
I told you it doesn't matter!

550
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,860
Here we go.

551
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,720
Whoa!

552
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,780
Here we go!

553
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,000
Right, right, right.

554
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,480
Oh, no, no, no.

555
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,840
It doesn't matter.

556
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,180
I'm just gonna follow the people in the front.

557
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,360
We need a better one.

558
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:46,320
We need to watch this.

559
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,580
This is the spot, guys!

560
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:50,920
This is the spot, guys!

561
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,480
This is the spot, guys!

562
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:53,660
Watch left and right.

563
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:58,440
Wait, Gumi's not in this group.

564
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,200
So fast, so fast.

565
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,540
Gumi's not in this group.

566
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,140
I hate you.

567
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,560
Gumi, she's not in this group.

568
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,980
What the hell is wrong with you?

569
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:12,300
What the hell is wrong with you?

570
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,860
We have to chill until six minutes.

571
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,380
Gumi, where are you?

572
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,020
It's okay.

573
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:20,740
I'm in the middle.

574
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,860
I'm in the middle.

575
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,680
I don't help out.

576
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:23,460
I'm just a leecher.

577
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,440
I know my place.

578
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,280
Oh, they're running.

579
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,060
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

580
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:29,440
Everything's fine.

581
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:32,840
It's not fine.

582
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:33,440
It's not fine.

583
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,800
I heard somebody get hit.

584
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,180
It's okay.

585
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,160
It's not fine.

586
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,640
I heard people get hit.

587
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,640
You never.

588
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:41,460
Andre.

589
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,440
Yo, you're tweaking.

590
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,740
Just die for us, please.

591
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:48,500
I love that.

592
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:49,760
That's insane.

593
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,260
Oh my god.

594
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,520
We're gonna go left.

595
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,520
Left, left, left.

596
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,400
Left, left, left.

597
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,820
Right, right, right, right.

598
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:00,940
We got comms.

599
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,860
Oh shit.

600
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:04,800
Don't stop.

601
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:05,820
Keep running.

602
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,300
Oh my god.

603
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,260
They're so pretty.

604
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,280
They are.

605
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,300
They are so pretty.

606
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:14,500
They are so pretty.

607
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,600
They're like this size.

608
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,140
They're like Zia.

609
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,100
Oh my god.

610
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,500
Gumi's better.

611
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,040
I love how they start.

612
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,420
My brother, no.

613
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,040
Is it only one doll?

614
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,220
No one behind us.

615
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:30,740
There's several.

616
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,240
No one behind.

617
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,120
No.

618
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:35,920
No.

619
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,620
He didn't complain at all.

620
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,080
He didn't complain at all.

621
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,000
This is scary.

622
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:45,240
Okay, I'm fucking.

623
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,920
Oh my god.

624
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,440
I can't hear the sounds.

625
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,860
I can't hear the sounds.

626
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,240
I can't hear the sounds.

627
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,880
Oh my god.

628
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,520
Oh my god.

629
00:31:59,460 --> 00:31:59,560
Oh my god.

630
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,100
I hear so many people.

631
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,200
That's so scary.

632
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,420
Right, right, right, right.

633
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,840
Mine, mine, mine, mine.

634
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,280
Mine, mine, mine, mine.

635
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,800
Mine, mine, mine, mine.

636
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,800
Oh my god.

637
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:16,620
Oh my god.

638
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,480
Oh, the fuck is he doing?

639
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,320
He's dragging.

640
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,860
Oh my god.

641
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:23,960
Oh no.

642
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,700
Oh my god.

643
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,220
Oh my god.

644
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:29,660
I messed up.

645
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,320
I messed up.

646
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,060
No, I'm dead.

647
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:31,520
I'm dead.

648
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,340
I'm so dead.

649
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,000
I'm so dead.

650
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:34,500
I saw.

651
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:37,720
I got confused because I thought people turned around.

652
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,300
Oh, people are turning around.

653
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,340
People are turning around.

654
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:47,160
Oh my god.

655
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:47,980
Good thing I was first.

656
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:50,300
We have one behind.

657
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,600
Oh my god.

658
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,760
Oh, the places are so strong.

659
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:55,800
No!

660
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,700
Oh no.

661
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,740
Oh my god.

662
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:01,420
Just keep going.

663
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:01,920
Just keep going.

664
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:02,520
I'm dead.

665
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:02,940
I'm dead.

666
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:05,900
Oh my god.

667
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,540
Five of them died.

668
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,780
Five of them actually died.

669
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,560
Oh my god.

670
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,040
Any spot here?

671
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:12,540
Any spot here?

672
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,480
Oh my god.

673
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,840
Five of them actually died.

674
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,460
Oh my god.

675
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,920
Oh my god.

676
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,460
I just saw.

677
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,600
I saw five of them die in front of me.

678
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,720
I saw five of them die in front of me.

679
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,100
I saw five of them die in front of me.

680
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,540
He even died next to me.

681
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,340
Oh my god.

682
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,920
I made it.

683
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,020
I'm better than him.

684
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:46,050
I am that Vtuber.

685
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:51,650
Oh my god.

686
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:55,830
Oh my god.

687
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:57,850
Oh my god.

688
00:33:57,850 --> 00:33:57,930
Oh my god.

689
00:33:57,930 --> 00:33:59,110
That is so scary.

690
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:04,510
I claim another soul.

691
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:07,310
I claimed another soul.

692
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:13,990
Oh my god.

693
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:17,750
If I eliminate this one, I'm fine.

694
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:18,650
I took one down.

695
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:20,790
I took a Minecraft pro in front of me.

696
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:22,130
I took a...

697
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:24,290
I'm okay with that.

698
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:29,110
I'm actually okay with that because I took a Minecraft pro player down.

699
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:30,890
That's alright.

700
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:31,290
That's alright.

701
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:32,170
Right.

702
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:32,810
Right.

703
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:33,190
Right.

704
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:33,690
Right.

705
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:37,670
I'm fine with that outcome.

706
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:38,970
I just thought that was funny.

721
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:49,090
With another group.

722
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,030
I'm pretty sure I went after them.

723
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:50,650
They are over that way.

724
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:50,810
Okay.

725
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:52,690
I'm here.

726
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:52,910
I'm here.

727
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:52,910
I'm here.

728
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:54,170
I'm here.

729
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,590
5UP died next to me.

730
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:00,230
It was me and 5UP.

731
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,290
And the doll chose him.

732
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:03,110
Oh no.

733
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:10,390
I mean the people can't.

734
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:11,450
The people can't find us.

735
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:11,910
The people can't find us.

736
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:15,630
Yeah, but I don't think they are finding people.

737
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:16,530
I think they are just running.

738
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:19,410
Are the spawns like randomized?

739
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:21,450
Yeah, they are randomized now.

740
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,070
Your spawn points are randomized now.

741
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:25,450
I think we should go through this corner right now.

742
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:30,290
The worst part was that Yesterday, he would have made it.

743
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:35,650
If he didn't fought for our side to like have a restart of another game.

744
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:38,690
He would have actually made it to the next round.

745
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:46,530
That's like the actual That's like the most messed up part.

746
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,490
The most messed up part.

747
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:49,010
That was that.

748
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:50,130
He could have made it.

749
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:52,750
If he didn't fought for us.

750
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:54,710
Rest in peace, man.

751
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:56,490
Rest in peace.

752
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:00,450
Oh my god.

753
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:02,970
Yeah, I don't remember any bombs going off.

754
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:03,550
This is bomb 1.

755
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:06,390
Nobody is dying too.

756
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:08,650
The real one.

757
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:09,970
The real one.

758
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:12,090
It's not the fireball one.

759
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:12,450
It's not.

760
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:16,870
The fireball one has a pompadour.

761
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:20,350
I think this is the one that's invisible.

762
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:22,290
I think this is the one that's invisible.

763
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:24,310
No, no, no, no.

764
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:25,210
No, no, no, no.

765
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:26,670
That is a scam.

766
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:29,710
I feel like the invisible one has to be a troll.

767
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:30,670
There's no way.

768
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:32,770
No way.

769
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:37,290
It's a doll that looks like one of us.

770
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:38,130
And it's in the group.

771
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:39,370
And it doesn't get you until the end.

772
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:41,390
Wait, no, don't say that!

773
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,250
Okay, just stop moving.

774
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:45,290
Don't go close.

775
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:47,430
Don't go close.

776
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:52,530
Wally, why are you standing up right now?

777
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:53,310
I hear them.

778
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,070
There's no time.

779
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:56,710
That's the thing.

780
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:57,510
There's no time.

781
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:58,530
Let's banish Wally.

782
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:02,570
There's no time, by the way.

783
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:05,530
So, like, it only stops when six people are eliminated.

784
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:11,250
The fact that no one's died and no one's run past us probably means something.

785
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:13,030
Keep talking to me.

786
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:14,070
Wally, come on.

787
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,530
You went and did it to my dog, man.

788
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:18,310
Gumi's dog is worth it.

789
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:19,590
Thank you.

790
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:20,210
Thank you.

791
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:20,870
You love Kazu.

792
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:22,770
Thank you for the rain.

793
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:23,210
Thank you.

794
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:26,290
This is anxiety the game right now.

795
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:28,950
I'm standing for that one, too.

796
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:30,170
I'll get back up then, twin.

797
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:32,090
I'm so scared.

798
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:36,330
I've been in a Minecraft event for the past four days.

799
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:37,250
Happy Pride.

800
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:39,330
We're all waiting.

801
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:41,170
There's a doll that's gonna kill us.

802
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:44,250
And we have to survive and those six people are dead.

803
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:47,030
So I'm scared.

804
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:48,730
I'm so scared.

805
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:51,550
My heart is beating.

806
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:53,490
My heart is beating.

807
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:55,810
I think everyone's in each corner.

808
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:57,670
I think everyone's in each corner.

809
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:58,830
Wherever the doll...

810
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:00,090
We're all in the corner, right?

811
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:02,150
Runners, okay, okay.

812
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:03,070
We rotate slow.

813
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:04,690
Rotate slow.

814
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:06,150
Let's merge groups.

815
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:11,470
I don't wanna be, like, in the very beginning.

816
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:13,970
This guy gave wrong comps earlier.

817
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:19,930
That was the one time.

818
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:20,310
That was the one time.

819
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:20,950
That was the one time.

820
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:22,890
We'll be going down the wrong direction.

821
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:23,570
Run!

822
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,870
Save, save, save.

823
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,710
Save, save, save, save.

824
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:29,030
Save, save, save, save.

825
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:31,190
Team behind us, not safe.

826
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:31,830
Team behind us.

827
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:35,650
Oh, no!

828
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:37,670
I can't see!

829
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:38,610
I'm running.

830
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:40,730
Okay, okay.

831
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:41,630
Oh, no.

832
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,290
Guys, you can stop.

833
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:46,430
You can stop running.

834
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:47,170
Guys, you guys can stop.

835
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,310
We're fine, we're fine.

836
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:49,610
No!

837
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:59,310
If I do F5, guys, guys, if I do F5, it's worse because I'm bumped into things.

838
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,010
I'm directionally challenged.

839
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:02,470
They're trying to troll us.

840
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:05,610
We're not trolling.

841
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:08,870
Would I ever lie?

842
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:10,810
Wait, there's literally nothing lying.

843
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:11,130
Oh, my God.

844
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:14,930
I'm so confused!

845
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:16,410
Wait, wait, wait.

846
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,410
What's going on?

847
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:20,190
What's going on?

848
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,090
Yeah, just stop.

849
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:22,730
Maybe stop next corner.

850
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:24,010
This is the best corner.

851
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:28,570
Oh, my God.

852
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:29,730
This group merged.

853
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:31,010
Good job, guys.

854
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:33,290
This group got bigger.

855
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:35,330
I feel like everyone's here.

856
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,170
How did this group get bigger?

857
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:39,410
No, no, there's another group.

858
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:41,230
Crouch, crouch, crouch.

859
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:43,170
How did I squeeze?

860
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:48,990
How did we fucking get stipulated to have a magic group?

861
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:51,890
The group expansion.

862
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:54,570
I don't like flying.

863
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:57,850
How did this group get bigger?

864
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:01,210
You can see through the thing right there.

865
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:01,630
Just F5.

866
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:06,190
Oh, my God.

867
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:07,170
I don't understand.

868
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:09,850
There's more of us now.

869
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:12,810
I'm going to believe in the group.

870
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:16,450
Yeah, how is no one dead?

871
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:17,290
No.

872
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:19,490
This all must be really bad.

873
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:21,870
Bro, we're going to be in here forever.

874
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:27,270
If the doll is not going to speed up, it's going to take forever.

875
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:33,110
Oh, my God.

876
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:35,210
This all sucks!

877
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:39,310
Blonde, they deleted the blonde girl that's fast.

878
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:41,570
Wait, they deleted her?

879
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:42,190
Why?

880
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:44,790
We won fast!

881
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:47,210
No, but the blonde boy isn't the fast one.

882
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:49,350
We won the fast one!

883
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:50,870
The blonde girl is the fast one.

884
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:54,310
Why would they delete the fastest?

885
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:56,230
Is it the same speed the entire round?

886
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:56,970
Or does it get faster?

887
00:40:57,390 --> 00:41:01,270
It will get faster from round to round, but not during the round, I don't think.

888
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:05,310
Maybe if it's going to take too long, they're going to just speed it up manually.

889
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:10,870
So that, like, one step is like 20 blocks.

890
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:14,510
How many times does it have to hit you?

891
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:15,530
Like, a few times there, right?

892
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:16,670
Two or four.

893
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:19,830
Depending on which goal it is.

894
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:21,370
Don't you know?

895
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:23,870
The real RNG.

896
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:25,950
The real RNG.

897
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:31,110
They made it fast now.

898
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,230
They're listening.

899
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:35,090
Oh, they're listening to us.

900
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:35,950
Shift, shift, shift.

901
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:40,910
He'd be really cool if, like, the admins give us extra help.

902
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:45,090
Hey, it would be really cool if they let you put more RNG in here.

903
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:47,510
If it says you're getting hunted, then...

904
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:48,630
It would be really funny.

905
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:50,530
If I'm getting hunted, I won't say a thing, guys.

906
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:51,530
All I'm saying.

907
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:53,590
If I get hunted, I'm not going to say anything.

908
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:54,750
I want to...

909
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:59,890
I'm going to say, I will help out the group.

910
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:06,650
Guys, it would be fun if they added more RNG.

911
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:09,370
Guys, don't you want to watch the underdog?

912
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:10,270
Main channel!

913
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:14,470
Don't you want to watch the underdog make it to the final round?

914
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:16,890
I am the underdog.

915
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:18,930
I should get more RNG.

916
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,450
It would be so funny.

917
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:25,330
Okay, tell me when I'm back on the main channel.

918
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:26,570
And I'm going to preach it.

919
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:30,770
I'm going to preach it if I make it to the main channel.

920
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:36,810
I thought he was the fireball one.

921
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:37,090
Okay.

922
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:39,310
What is this one, anyway?

923
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:46,150
Okay, I like how they increased the speed, but everybody is still alive.

924
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:48,350
So, what does this one do?

925
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:50,790
I think he's just super strong.

926
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:52,870
He's just super strong.

927
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:00,350
So, where is he?

928
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:00,650
Where is he?

929
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:04,270
He's 0.1.

930
00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:09,110
If you say left, does that mean we run left?

931
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:11,650
If I say left, then that means we go right.

932
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:13,730
If you say left, we right.

933
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:15,830
Run the way Shata says.

934
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:18,870
If you see it on the right, yell left.

935
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:21,710
Yeah, whatever way gets called, run that way.

936
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:24,390
Why are we making it so complicated?

937
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:27,470
Why are we faking...

938
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:32,770
Guys, make sure that you're rounding corners instead of going close to them.

939
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:37,890
I swear, if this messes me up, if I die because of F5, it's on you guys.

940
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:39,310
Don't give me no shit.

941
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:48,510
We all know my weakness.

942
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:52,430
That's what they said they were going to do, but I didn't see a single blonde girl.

943
00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:57,750
Going back aboard a boy.

944
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:01,210
I'm really like...

945
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:03,310
It's just not possible.

946
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:05,690
Where is the doll?

947
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:06,890
Plus one!

948
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:08,690
Increase the doll!

949
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:10,690
Increase the doll speed!

950
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:13,490
I think they should.

951
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:15,450
Give us some more talent.

952
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:16,370
Stay locked in.

953
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:17,510
There's still six of us in the night here.

954
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:19,450
I like that.

955
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:21,890
Spawn the doll next to us.

956
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:22,330
Do it.

957
00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:23,210
It'll be so funny.

958
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:24,830
Slow it down.

959
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:26,810
What is happening?

960
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:29,270
Oh my god.

961
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:30,070
Can you make it reverse?

962
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:31,550
Wait.

963
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:35,630
If the doll is not locked in on anybody, will it even move?

964
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:38,590
Yeah, it just goes in random directions.

965
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:39,770
It always hunts.

966
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:41,490
It's always hunting?

967
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:43,730
Then why are they saying the doll is at the center?

968
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:46,110
Maybe it sees through walls.

969
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:48,170
They're speeding dolls up again?

970
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:51,150
Speed the doll up and spawn one right next to us.

971
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:53,910
Spawn one doll next to each group.

972
00:44:54,890 --> 00:44:56,470
It'll be so funny.

973
00:44:57,710 --> 00:44:59,270
If you want content,

974
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:04,990
spawn the doll next to each group.

975
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:07,610
And then, like, increase the speed.

976
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:08,370
Blood armor!

977
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:10,890
Toki is fine.

978
00:45:11,830 --> 00:45:13,250
It'll be so funny.

979
00:45:13,570 --> 00:45:16,450
And I'm gonna get eliminated first after seeing all the fun.

980
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:18,330
I'll spot you on top of our heads.

981
00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:21,370
Oh my god.

982
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:22,510
Alright, I'm not gonna lie.

983
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:23,330
I'm not gonna lie.

984
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:24,210
I'm gonna hunt it over there.

985
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:25,690
We're gonna just throw it in the group.

986
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:27,310
Yeah, I did.

987
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:27,790
I did.

988
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:28,270
I did, I did, I did.

989
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:29,130
Oh, wait.

990
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:33,510
Somebody is hunting them.

991
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:37,310
Everybody is starting moving to them.

992
00:45:37,810 --> 00:45:44,730
Don't go too far.

993
00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:53,390
Oh, I'm locked in.

994
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:54,970
My brain is your brain now.

995
00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:56,530
What is going on?

996
00:45:57,930 --> 00:45:58,770
A great migration.

997
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:01,570
A great migration right now.

998
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:05,690
The penguin huddle.

999
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:09,550
Wait, one person is almost more scary.

1000
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:10,270
No!

1001
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:17,070
Why are they whispering to each other?

1002
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:18,190
We can still hear you.

1003
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:23,110
They might have gone into a hide hole.

1004
00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:27,070
No, if they go into a hide hole, it, like, highlights it on the map for us for a second.

1005
00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:28,530
Yeah, we can see it now.

1006
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:29,950
We don't know where the dolls are.

1007
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:30,850
We don't know.

1008
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:31,530
Nobody's dead.

1009
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:32,850
Nerd.

1010
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:35,370
No, we don't know.

1011
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:37,010
Nobody's dead.

1012
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:38,050
That's the worst part.

1013
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:39,690
Nice.

1014
00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:41,010
What the heck?

1015
00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:42,650
Come on.

1016
00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:46,570
Come on, this is a victory, bitch.

1017
00:46:46,810 --> 00:46:47,190
Guys.

1018
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:48,650
Oh, no.

1019
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:49,790
Andres.

1020
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:51,030
Go for a walk, please.

1021
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:54,770
Of course it was Andres.

1022
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:56,450
Get over there, get over there.

1023
00:46:56,590 --> 00:46:56,990
What?

1024
00:46:57,050 --> 00:46:59,170
Go over there.

1025
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:00,870
Come on, speed up the dogs.

1026
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:02,650
Speed up the dogs.

1027
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:05,370
Nobody has done it still, right?

1028
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:07,030
No, nobody's died.

1029
00:47:07,610 --> 00:47:08,650
Everybody's still alive.

1030
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:15,950
Second round is literally just chilling.

1031
00:47:16,430 --> 00:47:18,990
Like, the most anxious type of chilling.

1032
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:22,070
None of the groups are moving.

1033
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:24,130
None of the groups are moving.

1034
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:24,750
None of the groups are moving.

1035
00:47:24,770 --> 00:47:25,670
We just saw them.

1036
00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:27,230
Just in the corner.

1037
00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:31,270
Not relaxed, but filled with anxiety.

1038
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:32,510
Don't be in two spots.

1039
00:47:32,690 --> 00:47:34,290
Who wants to volunteer to run into the other group?

1040
00:47:36,290 --> 00:47:37,470
Oh my god.

1041
00:47:38,270 --> 00:47:39,390
That's so fast.

1042
00:47:40,310 --> 00:47:40,950
That's so fast.

1043
00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:42,850
Oh my god.

1044
00:47:42,890 --> 00:47:43,490
Oh my god.

1045
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:45,750
Oh my god.

1046
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:46,510
Oh my god.

1047
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:53,790
If you're happy and you know how to clap your hands, that's not a problem.

1048
00:47:54,770 --> 00:47:55,270
Goodbye.

1049
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:56,930
Goodbye.

1050
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:03,790
I'm free.

1051
00:48:03,890 --> 00:48:04,570
I'm free.

1052
00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:05,910
Oh my god.

1053
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:08,790
Where did the dog come from?

1054
00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:11,070
Oh my god.

1055
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:14,530
It actually came from nowhere.

1056
00:48:15,330 --> 00:48:16,250
No.

1057
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:18,270
I jinxed myself.

1058
00:48:19,490 --> 00:48:22,670
I didn't realize they actually listened.

1059
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:25,010
They

1060
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,040
actually listened.

1061
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:34,240
Okay, look.

1062
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:36,380
I said it would be funny.

1063
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:37,940
But I didn't.

1064
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,520
They spotted next to me.

1065
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:45,980
Oh my god.

1066
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:50,480
It actually came out of nowhere.

1067
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:52,740
Holy shit.

1068
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,520
The karma was real.

1069
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:03,520
It was so real.

1070
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:05,000
They were...

1071
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:07,400
Oh my god.

1072
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:08,900
I can't...

1073
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:10,020
No.

1074
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:15,560
The one time I was like...

1075
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:18,200
It would be so funny if they do all that.

1076
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:19,360
I get hit.

1077
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:21,380
I actually...

1078
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:23,940
I actually got hit by that.

1079
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,740
That's actually insane.

1080
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:30,900
That's actually insane.

1081
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:33,220
Oh my god.

1082
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:36,140
I did not expect that at all.

1083
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:41,300
I mean 63 out of 150.

1084
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:42,960
I call that a win.

1085
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:44,800
Alright.

1086
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:46,260
Gumi needs to live.

1087
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:47,940
Gumi needs to live.

1088
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:50,000
So I'm really free.

1089
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:51,920
Oh my god.

1090
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:52,880
I don't have to...

1091
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:53,240
Okay guys.

1092
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:55,120
I'll explain to you about game 2.

1093
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:57,460
Game 2 was so messed up.

1094
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:58,860
Game 2...

1095
00:49:59,240 --> 00:49:59,500
Okay.

1096
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,380
That doll was so messed up.

1097
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,080
That doll was actually so fast.

1098
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:06,180
Like I was so surprised how fast it was.

1099
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:08,540
It literally came out of nowhere.

1100
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:09,640
It literally came out of nowhere.

1101
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,600
Nobody realized it was gonna come.

1102
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:13,020
Nobody realized it was gonna come.

1103
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,520
It actually came out of nowhere.

1104
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:19,000
I'll explain the second game and why.

1105
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:21,880
I was like... I hope to god I don't make it to the second game.

1106
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:23,540
Because the second game was actually...

1107
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,160
Because the second game was actually...

1108
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,920
It was actually like...

1109
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:30,560
It's not even RNG anymore.

1110
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,920
So it's like Hunters and...

1111
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:36,520
It's like Hunters versus Prey.

1112
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:38,200
So it's sort of like Prod Hunt.

1113
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:39,860
But there's no props.

1114
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:40,960
And like Hunters...

1115
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,340
Hunters has to get...

1116
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:44,040
It's not a team game by the way.

1117
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:45,440
It's not a team game unless you're a Prey.

1118
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:46,420
The Prey is a team game.

1119
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:49,680
Because like each Prey... Prey has to get 5 notes to survive.

1120
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:53,480
If the Prey gets all 5 notes and survives...

1121
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:54,820
The Hunters...

1122
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:58,420
The Hunters with the lowest elimination will get eliminated.

1123
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,440
And they have to do several rounds of that.

1124
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:04,080
So like... But then there was like a lot of other stuff.

1125
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:08,560
There were like a lot of other things in there too.

1126
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:10,480
There were a lot of rules in there.

1127
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:11,600
Individual rules.

1128
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,200
I'm like simplifying this.

1129
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:15,120
But it was so complicated.

1130
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,000
So there was like...

1131
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,760
It was like a more skilled game.

1132
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:24,100
Because the third one...

1133
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:27,820
was full on.

1134
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,260
There was a parkour.

1135
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,940
The third game was...

1136
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:32,480
I also didn't want to live to the third game.

1137
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:34,320
Because the third game was like...

1138
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:35,840
There was parkour.

1139
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:37,600
There was parkour.

1140
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:38,980
There was a maze.

1141
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:40,620
This is all in one game.

1142
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:41,780
There was a parkour.

1143
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:42,960
Maze.

1144
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:45,920
An escape room.

1145
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,760
It's all individual.

1146
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,640
And there's traps.

1147
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:56,120
There's traps.

1148
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,860
In every single objective.

1149
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,620
But the thing is...

1150
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:03,160
If you die from each of those...

1151
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:05,020
From any of those areas...

1152
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:06,340
You get reset.

1153
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:09,600
Because your team can help you in a way.

1154
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:13,020
There's like things there where you need a team...

1155
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:14,860
Where you need a person to be there to help you.

1156
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:16,100
So...

1157
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:17,220
So like...

1158
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:20,780
So like the escape room...

1159
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:23,120
Your teammates can help you for the escape room.

1160
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,660
But they can also choose to not help you as well.

1161
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:28,700
Because it's all individual tasks you have to do in the escape room.

1162
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:29,640
So like...

1163
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:31,880
But if you die in any of them...

1164
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:34,540
You get reset to the beginning.

1165
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:35,660
Of the area.

1166
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:38,560
So I was like...

1167
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:39,280
Yeah...

1168
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:43,780
I saw the maze part.

1169
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,180
I saw the maze.

1170
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,040
And there's like spike traps too.

1171
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:48,640
Apparently.

1172
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:52,580
There's like spike traps at the maze area and stuff like that.

1173
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:53,840
And I was like...

1174
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:55,160
Yeah...

1175
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:57,200
I was just like...

1176
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:01,140
I was just like...

1177
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:02,200
No...

1178
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:04,000
There's two mazes!

1179
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:05,200
Okay...

1180
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,460
I thought there was one maze.

1181
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:10,200
It's parkour paintings maze.

1182
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:13,740
And basically...

1183
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:16,100
If you get caught by a ghost...

1184
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:18,500
If you get caught by the ghost...

1185
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,000
In that painting maze...

1186
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,240
You are reset to the beginning of the maze.

1187
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:23,240
So...

1188
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,040
And then...

1189
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:27,840
And then...

1190
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:28,720
The third one...

1191
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,460
Was a spike maze.

1192
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,700
If you die by the spikes...

1193
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:35,500
You get reset to the beginning of the maze.

1194
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:37,100
And then...

1195
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:38,260
And then...

1196
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:41,620
If you went through all that mental torture...

1197
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:43,740
You get to do the escape room.

1198
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:52,800
So that's why...

1199
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:53,960
I was like...

1200
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:55,140
Oh my god...

1201
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:56,140
Just take me here.

1202
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:00,880
Oh thank god.

1203
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:06,980
I was getting tortured by the dolls.

1204
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:07,780
You know...

1205
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:10,260
I took some minecraft pros down with me.

1206
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:12,260
Rest in peace 5up.

1207
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:13,860
It was funny though.

1208
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:14,900
Not gonna lie.

1209
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,960
You would have been in the next game.

1210
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:19,660
But it was so funny.

1211
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,920
I thought you died next to me.

1212
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:25,400
Just for me...

1213
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:28,840
Just for me to die first in the next round.

1214
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:32,820
Just for me to die first in the next round.

1215
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:33,900
Just for me to die first in the next round.

1216
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:34,160
Also...

1217
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,000
Guys...

1218
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,220
I found out...

1219
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:38,240
I found out...

1220
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:40,340
That on Friday...

1221
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:41,820
Is the Summer Games Fest.

1222
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:44,400
So I'm gonna be doing a watch along.

1223
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:45,300
It might be...

1224
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:47,300
I might just have one rest day.

1225
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,560
Summer Games Fest watch along on Twitch.

1226
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:53,960
At like 2pm.

1227
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,700
It starts at 2pm right?

1228
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:56,680
Or does it start at 3pm?

1229
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:58,440
Whatever time it starts...

1230
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:01,160
We're gonna do a watch along on the 7th.

1231
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:02,720
So yeah...

1232
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,100
I'll see you guys back on Twitch on the 7th.

1233
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:05,480
I guess.

1234
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:15,480
God that was so funny.

1235
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:16,020
I can't believe.

1236
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:18,200
The one time I got confident.

1237
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:19,980
I actually got karma so hard.

1238
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:21,900
Every time I had zero confidence.

1239
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:22,980
And I didn't troll.

1240
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:24,580
We were okay.

1241
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:28,240
And then the moment where I spawned the doll right next to us.

1242
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:29,840
It will be so funny.

1243
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:32,400
And then they spawned the doll right next to me.

1244
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:42,120
Oh my god.

1245
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:43,460
It's actually...

1246
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:44,700
Messed up.

1247
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:47,240
Goomy wants me to watch Goomy's POV.

1248
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:48,400
I'm watching her POV.

1249
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:48,720
Why?

1250
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:51,000
Why?

1251
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:54,420
It was funny though.

1252
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,180
It was pretty funny.

1253
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:04,980
What do you mean she called me for not watching the corner?

1254
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:08,700
What do you mean?

1255
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:11,760
I should not be watching that corner.

1256
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,320
There was a huge...

1257
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:15,040
A huge pack next to us.

1258
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:17,400
There was literally...

1259
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:18,500
A horde.

1260
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:20,820
Why was it me?

1261
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:22,600
That had to watch it?

1262
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:25,440
Why?

1263
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:29,180
There were actual Minecraft players.

1264
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,320
They should not depend on me.

1265
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:32,280
To watch a corner.

1266
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:34,060
That's so stupid.

1267
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:38,440
Why would you depend on somebody that didn't even know what was going on?

1268
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:42,880
Why would you depend on somebody that didn't even know what was going on?

1269
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:46,060
That was trying to sabotage.

1270
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:50,020
Okay.

1271
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:50,780
Alright.

1272
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:52,900
Alright.

1273
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:53,500
Let's see.

1274
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,900
Let me pull up my stream labels.

1275
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:56,860
Because I want to thank everybody.

1276
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,400
I want to say thank you for the tier 1 sub.

1277
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:01,620
Thank you for the tier 1.

1278
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,320
Random vtuber 13.

1279
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,860
Thank you for gifting a sub to 5.

1280
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:08,780

1281
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,820

00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,840
Thank you for the tier 1 sub.

1284
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:18,940
I'm trying to look at the gifteds right now.

1285
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:21,260
Where are the...

1286
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:23,260
Where are the gifteds?

1287
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:27,100
Oh my god.

1288
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:29,120
Where are the gifteds?

1289
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:29,600
Oh no.

1290
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:30,300
Do I...

1291
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:31,220
Guys, I'm sorry.

1292
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:33,260
My thing doesn't sync.

1293
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:34,800
Where are the gifted settings?

1294
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:36,980

1295
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:37,600
Oh no.

1296
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:40,840
Guys, I don't remember how to use my labels.

1297
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:42,420
Oh, here it is.

1298
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:42,980
Okay.

1299
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:44,740
No, that's not what it is.

1300
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:45,700
I just refreshed it.

1301
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:47,560
Sorry, I'm trying to remember where the gifts are.

1302
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:49,520
Wait, are there no gifts here?

1303
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:51,760
Where are the gifts?

1304
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:55,180
Professional streamers.

1305
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:57,460
Anyway, thank you for all the gifts, guys.

1306
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:58,840
Dragon, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

1307
00:57:59,060 --> 00:57:59,320
Thank you.

1308
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:02,280
Well, I get to start my rest now.

1309
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:04,840
What a day, though.

1310
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:06,120
Huge shoutout for Twitch.

1311
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:07,920
For random vtuber.

1312
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:10,400
Thank you for gifting a sub to Keck W.

1313
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:14,100
I'm just going to say a huge shoutout for the invite.

1314
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:17,240
I know I was, like, crying about it.

1315
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:18,880
That I made it this far.

1316
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:21,160
But, like, honestly, we had...

1317
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:22,240
What a ride, though.

1318
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:25,860
What an insane ride we had together.

1319
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:28,800
That was actually crazy.

1320
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:32,820
I don't think any of us expected, like, the game...

1321
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:35,760
expected it to be like this.

1322
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:38,600
Day 3 was actually crazy.

1323
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:40,200
Oh my god.

1324
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,520
But, yeah, huge shoutout.

1325
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:50,600
Huge shoutout to, like, the invite and for going through this whole crazy event.

1326
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:53,100
I lasted all the way to Day 4.

1327
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:54,800
I mean, I'm proud of myself.

1328
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:57,760
I beat so many pro Minecraft players.

1329
00:58:57,980 --> 00:58:59,960
And we made it so far.

1330
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:02,980
So, yeah.

1331
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:03,620
It was fun.

1332
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:07,120
Thank you, everybody, for watching.

1333
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:08,220
It's finally over.

1334
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,080
We have freedom now.

1335
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:10,800
It's finally...

1336
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:18,740
It's finally over.

1337
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:20,040
We're all free.

1338
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,660
We can now enjoy...

1339
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:23,980
We can now enjoy resting.

1340
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,960
I'm gonna go raid Gumi so you can check out the rest of the...

1341
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:32,340
the rest of the journey if she's still alive.

1342
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:34,800
As always, everybody, stay hydrated.

1343
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:35,520
Pause to check.

1344
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:37,040
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

1345
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,960
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

1346
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:40,100
Cuz you deserve it.

1347
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:41,160
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

1348
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:42,180
Bye, guys!

1349
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:43,040
Bye!

1350
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:16,960
Alright, bonus ending.

1351
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:17,860
I forgot to chill.

1352
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:18,760
As always.

1353
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,880
If you guys don't know, I stream on YouTube, so check me out there.

1354
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:29,820
Anyone know whenever I stream on Twitch, check do exclamation point Twitter.

1355
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:32,080
And follow me on Twitter.

1356
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:36,800
Also, YouTube's reveal... YouTube's figure reveal.

1357
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:38,360
I'm gonna tweet about it later.

1358
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:40,540
The YouTube's figure.

1359
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:42,200
Yeah.

1360
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:43,060

1361
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:46,140
