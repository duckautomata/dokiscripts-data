1
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,750
Welcome to Blind Spot.

2
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:00,370
Actually, let's make that PUBG Blind Spot.

3
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:05,670
It's a 5v5 PvP game from a top-down view.

4
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,830
But watch your step.

5
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:11,450
Into the darkness lies the blind spot.

6
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:15,410
You can't see them, but they can see you.

7
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:19,510
Danger is literally around every spot.

8
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:24,650
Plant the bomb, defend the site, Haven't I played this a
million times before?

9
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:29,730
Well, hold that thought, because this is where we change the
rules.

10
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,070
Pick a route and let's break in.

11
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:36,910
Wait, hold up.

12
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:37,890
Keep it down.

13
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:38,770
Use your elbow.

14
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,190
Slip in quietly.

15
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,990
Watch every blind spot.

16
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,570
Shields up the front.

17
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,330
Use everything you've got.

18
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:51,090
Maybe Red Ship Amplifier this time.

19
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,390
Then, stealth mode.

20
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:53,930
Ambush.

21
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,390
Or, flashbang.

22
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:55,930
Ambush.

23
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,410
Breaching hook, blue chip detector.

24
00:04:58,990 --> 00:04:59,270
Ambush.

25
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,070
Wait.

26
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,590
What if they're waiting to ambush us?

27
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,630
As long as we've got your back, you'll clear that path
eventually.

28
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,470
Alright, here we are at the crypt site.

29
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:11,770
Man, look at that defense.

30
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,750
Let's bust these barricades open.

31
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:16,630
It's your showtime.

32
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:20,230
Smash it.

33
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,390
Blow it up!

34
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,110
Destroy everything!

35
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,010
Time to plant the decryptor.

36
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:31,310
But heads up, this is their last stand.

37
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,370
And they won't go down either.

38
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,230
Pop smoke and blind the defense.

39
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,170
Still too many hostiles?

40
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:39,610
Screw it!

41
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:42,210
Just force your way in and tank it with the shield!

42
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:49,610
Now, planting is the ideal way to win, sure.

43
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:56,430
But the decryptor's down there, and you're the last one
standing, then lock in.

44
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,870
It's time to make a highlight reel.

45
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:06,670
Double kill, triple kill, quadr kill, clutch.

46
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,310
Every angle counts.

47
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:12,990
PUBG Blindspot.

48
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:28,390
Oh, before I begin, I will have to mention a huge shout out
and thank you to PUBG Blindspot.

Better treat each other well, guys.

58
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,110
Yeah, ambush.

59
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,830
The donkey bird ambush.

60
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:27,070
All right, so the reason why we are doing a multi-stream is
because the tournament's up on February 15th and 16th.

61
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,410
Today's not the tournament, by the way.

62
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:32,230
Just a little disclaimer, a little reminder, guys, today is
not the tournament.

63
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:36,210
It's actually next week on February 15th to 16th.

64
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:39,010
Today is just the announcement of the tournament.

65
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:42,210
So I'm going to give you guys the details, what the
tournament structure is going to be like.

66
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:45,950
Who's going to be playing here, playing in my tournament?

67
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,050
There will be four teams.

68
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:52,790
You guys all see the, saw the captains, they got announced
already earlier this week.

69
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,850
But we'll finally know who are their teammates today.

70
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:05,210
But yes, like I said, the tournament itself will be a
multi-stream as well.

71
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:14,950
So for those who are at Twitch, you guys, Timmy, the Timmy's
over there, they will get the full casting and broadcast of

72
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:15,810

73
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:22,590
So the multiple team POVs, the match POVs, the casting, the
interviews, that's what the Timmy's are going to get.

74
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:28,430

85
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:51,990

101
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:02,130
Anyway, let's watch another trailer.

102
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,610
You guys might have already seen this trailer before, but
this was the announcement trailer on my tournament.

103
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:08,690
It does provide some of the details, which I will go in
depth later on.

104
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:10,550
But here we go.

105
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,330
2025 is over.

106
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,370
And so is the way.

107
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:21,190
Let the real games begin.

108
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,650
We don't have much time, so lock in.

109
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:27,650
Blindspot launches into early access.

110
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,790
A new era begins together with Doki Bird.

111
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,170
Hey, that's me!

112
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,370
This isn't just an update.

113
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:38,730
Strategy, mind games, and entire new formula to win.

114
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:42,030
You're about to witness the evolution of gameplay.

115
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:46,230
Who will be the first to show us these grand changes?

116
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,230
These are the players that I have my eyes on.

117
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:54,690
and are ready to bring the fun.

118
00:11:55,950 --> 00:12:02,410
Some of them might take big risks, so we'll just play for
Chaos, and others might be the surprise star.

119
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,150
Don't you want to know?

120
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,710
Let them show us.

121
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:09,530
This match is going to carry my name.

122
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,290
It's no small game.

123
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:17,610
That's right, a total of 15,000 USD, and the winner takes
$7,000.

124
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,870
Oh my God, that's a lot of money.

125
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:24,650
Get out yourself to see who takes the spotlight.

126
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:26,950
Working Cash T action?

127
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:30,970
Get your notes ready because we got it all right on screen.

128
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:33,330
Gotta write that down right now.

129
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:37,930
This match will be broadcast on my channel, Doki Bird.

130
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,450
You don't want to miss it out.

131
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:46,870
There won't be a second to miss, so tune in and see what
type of crazy plays your favorite creator is going to bring

132
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:47,230
out.

133
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:50,210
The plan for victory is ready in motion.

134
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:55,690
Well, I guess we better tune in and follow closely.

135
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:00,310
It's your turn to experience the blind spot.

136
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:03,670
Where's the new era on my stage?

137
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,890
I'll be waiting, but don't be late.

138
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:13,620
Whoa!

139
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,660
That's right!

140
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,200
A blind spot!

141
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,140
Oh, it is free to play, by the way.

142
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:21,460
So you can actually get joined right now in the early
access.

143
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,280
It's free to play and we love free stuff.

00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,680
Just feel free to click on the link.

145
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:31,340
in my two chats on twitch and youtube or in the description
below on the youtube and you can check out the game yourself

146
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:41,720
guys um okay funny funny story originally uh the trailer uh
was not narrated by me um but when we were going over it we

147
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:46,980
were like oh it feels a little you know we want to add more
like you know because it is a dokeyberg tournament and they

148
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:53,380
were like how about you narrate this instead of like you
know the voiceover because at first i was like whoa the the

149
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:58,960
guy voicing You know, he needs more personality in there,
more oomph to it.

150
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,540
And they're like, how about you narrate this?

151
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,900
And then I accidentally did not see the message for two
days.

152
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,440
And the deadline was, like, in two days.

153
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:11,120
And I was like, oh my God, I'm so sorry.

154
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,860
I'm so out of it.

155
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,020
And I was like, I did it.

156
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:18,560
I was like, don't worry, I got you.

157
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,940
Bam, there you go.

158
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,960
Thank you, pre-recorded, Doki.

159
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,540
I really appreciate it.

160
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:38,160
Another funny story, but the tournament was actually
originally was supposed to be on Valentine's Day, too.

161
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:43,220
It was originally supposed to be on February 14th, but I was
like, no, that's my dog's birthday.

162
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:50,640
So I really appreciate them letting me adjust the tournament
dates because I was like, I'm sorry.

163
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,260
That's my dog's birthday.

164
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,760
I gotta celebrate my dog's birthday on the 14th.

165
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,180
So, like, oh, that's okay.

166
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,740
We can have it the day after it's that.

167
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,240
Okay, I was like, yeah, that's a lot better.

168
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,960
That's the day after my dog's birthday.

169
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,740
I was like, I'm sorry, it's true dish.

170
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:13,580
So, I really appreciate them being super flexible on the
dates itself.

171
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,240
So, yeah, like, they've been very accommodating, very
flexible.

172
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,840
I really appreciate it.

173
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:36,260
lady but for the time hey we all we all love dad here okay
it's his birthday it's his special day um anyone uh uh let

174
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:45,520
us pull up the slides you guys are itching in anticipation
who is gonna be in this tournament uh all right let me all

175
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:54,220
right goodbye big dokey hello smaller dokey whoa look at
that mean they made the logo too isn't the logo so pretty

176
00:15:54,220 --> 00:16:03,400
donkey bird creator match pubg blind spot look that's me i
like how they color coded too to my colors as well all right

177
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:12,240
so for those who are wondering what is pubg blind spot um it
is um here's a little fun fact it's actually developed by a

178
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:21,980
very small team uh fewer than 20 developers uh who made this
game and um it's not battlegrounds In fact, it is its own

179
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,020
little thing.

180
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:27,060
So you guys might have remembered me playing this before in
a previous sponsor as well.

181
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,240
So the best part of this game is that it's free to play.

182
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,280
So you can actually try to gain yourself right now in early
access.

183
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:40,880
And it's basically like a top-down 5v5 tactical shooter.

184
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,000
So you know the drill regarding tactical shooters.

185
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,780
So you have a defense and attack side round.

186
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:50,620
And your goal is to either prevent the team from planting
the bomb or be the one to plant the bomb.

187
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:59,160
So, you know, you remember when during the last time I
played this game in the other, the earlier early axis, like

188
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,160
the guy that we were against, he was like against the wall.

189
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,160
And I was like, I'm going to breach that wall.

190
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:09,240
And I just, I just like, I destroyed the wall.

191
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,560
And he was just right there.

192
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,760
I was like, shoot him.

193
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,600
So, so I hope we get a lot.

194
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:20,160
I'm definitely going to be breaching a lot of walls next
week.

195
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,480
I'll be like, guys, don't worry.

196
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,280
He's definitely going to be on that other side.

197
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,020
I'm going to breach that wall.

198
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,800
Anyway, so yeah, you can destroy walls, wallbang, as you
guys saw in the trailer.

199
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,280
Shoot someone with a grenade launcher, which obviously
won't.

200
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,500
I'm going to try that one time.

201
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,180
And it's definitely not going to back.

202
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:46,560
I feel like when you guys see my team, you're going to know
like one of us is going to try that.

203
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:58,520
not gonna go wrong definitely nothing's gonna go badly from
that and we can use all types of util for an advantage um

204
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:06,040
and a lot of the utility is mapped to specific agents so
like each agent has its own utility its own um its own

205
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:13,220
specific guns and everything so you have to find which
perfect which agent is perfect for your playstyle uh but

206
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:17,300
yeah also another great thing is that their shared vision
combat.

207
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:23,700
So what that means is that your team shares enemy sightings
and lines of sight in real time.

208
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:28,360
So whether your teammate sees, you can see as well.

209
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,920
So basically your teammate can give you wall hacks as long
as they aren't incompetent and die.

210
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,000
Just don't die.

211
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,600
That's all we ask.

212
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:43,160
So we can always have wall hacks as long as they don't die.

213
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:53,700
oh i see also don't worry if you are not like very into like
the whole 5v5 tactical part of the gameplay there is team

214
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:58,480
death match um if you want to check out the game yourself
like i said there is team death match for those who just

215
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:05,280
don't want to go just want to go ungabunga uh but uh but in
the tournament we are going to be playing the um the other

216
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:15,300
game mode which is the search and destroy so the attack and
defense side uh so yeah anyway next slide which i control so

217
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:22,220
i'm telling myself next slide uh nsd welcome thank you for
the five gift and chips thank you thank you all right so

218
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:30,480
there are some patch notes that uh so i have to let you guys
know for those who have played the earlier access and have

219
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:37,920
seen the previous stream i've done for the sponsor stream um
they have changed some things um in this game compared to

220
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:49,300
the last time we looked into it so anyway small dokey will
be a smaller dokey now all right so anyway so um the first

221
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:57,180
thing that they added that we didn't see before is they
added this thing called down but not out um so in the

222
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:05,540
previous sponsor we didn't see this game um this ability
before so um basically I know this is gonna be super uh

223
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:12,040
funny when we do this in the tournament uh I know like a lot
of things are gonna go wrong when this happens in the

224
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:19,440
tournament But basically, what this means is that when you
kill someone, they don't full dive.

225
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,980
So they're down.

226
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,380
So you need to double tap them to kill someone.

227
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:33,820
So there is a revive system, which they added in the early
axis.

228
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,400
So they enter a down state.

229
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:43,040
And I can already imagine one of my teammates.

230
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:55,200
who you will find out later on who it is it's gonna be
shouting res me he's gonna be shouting res me come on res me

231
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:09,580
i'm safe it's not me okay it's not me okay technically it's
my entire team my entire team is is that player

232
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:25,300
safe guys i swear to god and the okay but another plus side
of this new update is that um they also can they can crawl

233
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:38,100
so so if you don't fully kill someone um they can crawl up i
can imagine you knock someone they just crawl away like

234
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:46,860
where do they go um but they can crawl away and they do
share vision um they can also share vision even though if

235
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:57,980
even if they're crawling um um so the shame crawl to me i
just want to do this okay if i have a chance in the

236
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:04,240
tournament i definitely i'm gonna knock someone down and
just watch them crawl away i'll be like all right boy lead

237
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:13,860
me to the rest of your teammates i know you want to oh
you're gonna lead me to someone that's gonna revive you lead

238
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,140
me to them

239
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:31,640
yeah I I can see some people doing that next week another
thing that they have changed I believe yeah they have

240
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:41,580
adjusted in before they wall bang you he takes you to one of
the walls and you get shot that's that at that point that's

241
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:48,920
just karma as I played with my food for too long um other
things they have added a mini map um shooting mechanisms

242
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:56,140
have improved um they have changed some of the stuff on the
maps so like if you notice some things from the early

243
00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:08,400
earlier access like the ones before uh they have changed a
few of these things and yeah and also expanded decrypt your

244
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:17,220
placement range um i believe has been yeah they have like a
placement range to it now anyway so these are patch note

245
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:25,880
number one patch note number two that they wanted me to let
you guys know is that they have added a new character yay so

246
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:36,440
there's a new new agent here his name is blaze a new
operator uh he uses he has a molotov gadget and also uses

247
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:44,300
the the ump 45 the ump 45 so this is the new operator that
they added uh for the newest early axis um and then there's

248
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:53,580
like a bunch of adjustments to a bunch of the other
characters like um buddy zen patch and haze so if you guys

249
00:23:53,580 --> 00:24:00,580
have played this game before um these characters have been
adjusted for the newer the current early axis so they are a

250
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:06,760
little bit different so zen for example he is only attack
only you could have played him in defense and attack Now

251
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,560
he's attack only.

252
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,720
Patch, he changed from defense only to attack defense.

253
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,320
So you can play her in both attack defense.

254
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,360
And he changed some stuff regarding Hayes' kit in general.

255
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,560
So you can't.

256
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,280
What the?

257
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,760
Okay, I didn't even realize this.

258
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:28,020
But in the past, he had a weapon that had headshot one hit
kill.

259
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,120
They thankfully removed that.

260
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,260
Thank God.

261
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,240
That, you know what?

262
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,620
No, that does seem a little bit...

263
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:47,580
broken so that's gone now don't worry that is gone now he
does not one shot headshot kill now so luckily we're safe um

264
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:56,120
so did it balance that out and yeah they change buddies uh
gadget as well so now he has what a camera drone toy

265
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:03,300
penetration gadget so that used to be haze's oh my god hey
oh yeah i remember haze had the penetration oh yeah haze was

266
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:15,320
crazy broken i remember now so yeah of that anymore uh thank
god uh all right those are all the new changes for the

267
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:25,260
current um for the cornfield of the early access so you were
used if you did play this before if all of these things

268
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:34,580
changed as well and we got a new new operator blaze all
right next up team captains yes so team captains this

269
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:40,420
tournament has um It has VTubers and Fleshy's, so it's a mix
of both.

270
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:45,320
And two team captains, as it was announced earlier, is me.

271
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,040
That's me.

272
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:51,720
Tokei Bear, Lily Pichu, Muda, and Sub-Rose.

273
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,840
I- Rosa, sorry.

274
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,240
Sub-Rosa.

275
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:58,080
I apologize if I mispronounce your names.

276
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:03,300
I, English is my very first language, but unfortunately, I
am a little bit illiterate.

277
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,200
I am very sorry.

278
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:15,320
these are the team captains um it is a team of five for each
team so they each pick we each picked our own teammates for

279
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:28,140
this tournament uh all right next up prizes the prize money
tournament structure so as i said before um this is a 15 000

280
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:36,620
tournament and it is fully funded fully sponsored by pubg
blind spot again thank you again yay thank you for funding

281
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:43,020
entire tournament and also helping me with the assets um and
uh they also are helping with the casting and the production

282
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:53,000
so um the production side of the the tournament stream is
going to be a very uh what's the word very high quality

283
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:00,080
because they actually got like a cat like they got she got
real casters instead of like you know uh me and mint trying

284
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:06,480
to trying to cast this so they they got actual professional
casters for this tournament and also a professional

285
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:12,400
production team uh for like the camera shots and everything
and the swapping between scenes so I won't be controlling

286
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:20,280
the uh I won't be solo controlling the entire tournament
stream this time like I have in the previous uh things I've

287
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:25,800
organized so there's going to be an actual professional
production team that's handling all of that so huge shout

288
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:37,280
out to PUBG blindspot for taking care of all this for me um
anyway so first place first place is 7,000 dollars.

289
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,820
Second place is $3,000 and third place is $2,000.

290
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:45,600
So everybody, everybody wins except for last place, but
everybody,

291
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,600
everyone gets money except for last, everyone gets money.

292
00:27:54,980 --> 00:28:01,020
Um, anyway, other than that, we do also have a special
prize.

293
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,600
It's just, just don't get last, but everyone gets money,
guys.

294
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:26,000
um anyway so there are special everyone wins um not actually
the fine print um and yeah the fine print anyway so so there

295
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:32,740
are also uh special prizes so each individual uh whoever the
individual who gets

296
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,800
the most valued player in the entire tournament gets an
additional $2,000.

297
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,020
And the kill leader can also get $1,000.

298
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:53,740
So we do have these two as the special incentives for those
who want to, you know, be like extra sweaty.

299
00:28:54,360 --> 00:29:00,760
So an individual can potentially even get both 2,000 or
1,000 at the same time.

300
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,700
If they're both the kill leader and MVP.

301
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:16,340
so technically last place could technically get kill leader
guys they could technically do it um and i believe wait let

302
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:26,640
me message um let me message just to be sure because i
wasn't fully sure about this one detail about how mvp is

303
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:33,160
selected so let me shoot this message real quick just to be
sure because I remember we were talking about this before um

304
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:39,980
so um so I just want to fully confirm before I say it
because that'll be a little awkward if I said it and then

305
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:49,920
the organizers you're like um that's uh that's not how we're
doing it so um regarding how MVP is selected anyway so other

306
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:57,820
than that this is the schedule uh February 6th right now uh
at 3 p.m PST which i just started uh the announcement stream

will be at 3 p.m psc uh for day one and grand finals will

309
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:28,080
also be um will also be at 3 p.m um psc um uh so just
letting you guys know it we to keep it very easy to remember

310
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:38,000
um every day of this tournament is at 3 p.m pst so we're not
like you know jump scaring everyone on how uh on how it's

311
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:53,480
done um okay so so so i'm just confirming how mvp is
selected for this right now um but yeah so uh group stage is

312
00:30:53,480 --> 00:31:01,300
most likely it okay most not most likely it is i am the i
don't know why i said most likely when i am in the

313
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:09,540
tournament but it is uh uh group stage uh round robin-esque
um and then the grand final is where like the elimination

314
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:24,920
actually starts all right next slide there we go i knew it
the overview there we go so format uh i oh all right so mvp

315
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:33,440
this is how mvp is going to be selected all right they said
my word is law all right so it'll be very uh awkward if

316
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:39,100
there was a different plan apparently i was not on the same
wavelength um they're like i think what you want is what we

317
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:46,140
will do so they assume that we are on the same wavelength so
okay so this is what i thought basically mvp will be

318
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:54,820
selected by a vote on my channel and then i and guys you
know you could also vote for me because i'm also on

319
00:31:54,940 --> 00:32:06,740
tournament too so but anyway but no no i'm not rigging the
votes guys we're not i'm not i'm just giving a suggestion

320
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:19,260
wait a bit so it will be the vote for nvp guys it's just
it's just a suggestion i'm not rigging anything um i was

321
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:30,280
giving an example of how you can vote so it will be a It'll
be a vote on the Twitch channel on the Dokeybird.

322
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,660
Right, got it.

323
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:36,200
Ricky, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

324
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:36,700
Disclaimer.

325
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:37,940
I'll give you a little disclaimer.

326
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,320
I was just giving an example.

327
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:45,320
Just a little, you know, a little example on how it could
work, you know?

328
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,640
It will be like, all right, who you guys want for MVP?

329
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,140
Oh, Dokeybird?

330
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,960
All right, let's put her name on the poll, guys.

331
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,920
And it's like Dokeybird and all the other options.

332
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:59,820
And if somehow Doki Bird wins, she gets MVP and $2,000.

333
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:07,840
But you guys can vote for anyone, even for someone who was
on last place too.

334
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:11,420
You know, you can also vote for someone who was on last
place.

335
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,360
It could also be me there in last place.

336
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:24,640
But anyway, that is how the MVP system will go.

337
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:39,140
so you all have a choice on who mvp is not me but you chat
the power is in your hands guys on who you want to vote for

338
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:51,300
on the dokeybird channel um who your oh she is also uh who
happens to also be dokeybird so it's it's your choice on how

339
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,300
this is gonna go uh

340
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:14,060
but it could be anyone it could be anyone it could be anyone
um anyway so so day one uh day day day one all right guys

341
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:21,820
how about okay i think it would be more fair i you know i'm
so humble i'm so humble and like i'm for the people you know

342
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:32,300
so i my own decision i'm will take myself out of the vote
because I want this tournament to be fair and just and I

343
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:41,740
know so many people will see me as the most valued player
going in as a person with the most experience going in but

344
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:58,400
because I am so humble and and I want other people to have a
chance to win MVP everyone a fair opportunity uh hashtag

345
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:15,620
humble um anyway so day one will be four teams group stage
so it is a round robin um but um the fourth team will get

346
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:29,580
eliminated before day two uh you're at i agree disgusting um
anyway so so the last place team um the fourth team will get

347
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:37,360
eliminated on day one and then on day two uh we will go
through the deciding matches between it'll just be like

348
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:51,060
elimination from uh the last remaining teams um another
thing to add uh about this uh i already forgot what it's

349
00:35:51,060 --> 00:36:00,460
gonna say there's no other thing to add that's it that i
mean the format is pretty straightforward four teams fight

350
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:10,840
it out the team that loses the most gets eliminated on day
one and oh yeah um we made sure to make the tournament not

351
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:16,780
too long we didn't combine it on into one day because we
were worried that it might be too long and people will get

352
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:22,740
tired so uh because of that we split it into determine they
can do whatever they want.

353
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,700
So day two would be a lot shorter compared to day one.

354
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:29,080
And all matches will be played simultaneously.

355
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,960
So the broadcast will only cover selected matches.

356
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,060
So like there's like a match if you want broadcast this
match.

357
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:40,260
But every game will be played simultaneously so they don't
have to wait in between games.

358
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,120
You know that's like obviously the worst part.

359
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:48,560
That's why I hate the most when you got to wait like one to
two hours towards the next game so yeah every game will be

360
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:57,020
played at once uh to give everyone uh to give every like you
know to move things on like forward in a nice timely manner

361
00:36:57,020 --> 00:37:07,520
um all right next slide whoa captains again all right so
who's gonna be on whose team uh i will start first you will

362
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:20,060
now understand why i say my team my team is gonna be a
little messy If we manage to work together and not yell at

363
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:22,600
each other, I will call that a win.

364
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:25,020
And I created this team, by the way.

365
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:29,600
I personally created this team, knowing what's going to
happen.

366
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,300
All right.

367
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,980
Anyway, so my team.

368
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,080
All right, Taniy Doki again.

369
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:43,960
It will be me, Koni, Heavenly Father, Super Gomez, and
Sherpa.

370
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:55,700
so um it was i was actually the last person to submit my
team because like like i said i had someone drop out last

371
00:37:55,700 --> 00:38:00,240
minute because uh they weren't feeling so good so they're
like i don't think i could do a tournament so it was like

372
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:11,720
it's okay and then i also was like um so each of us that's
why i'm saying like each of us would be the one to shout res

373
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:16,540
me Why didn't you rescue each of us?

374
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,120
It could be any one of us.

375
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:28,900
So it was actually really difficult to create this team
because everyone was apparently like very busy too.

376
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:38,200
So like I message a lot of people and I'm very thankful to
all the people that said yes to be part of my team and to

377
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,620
participate in this tournament.

378
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:47,660
So huge shout out to Kony, Heavenly Father, for joining this
tournament and being on my team.

379
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,280
This team, yeah.

380
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,660
I forgot.

381
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,840
Was there team kills?

382
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,080
Was there friendly fire?

383
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,460
I don't remember.

384
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:58,900
I think there wasn't, right?

385
00:38:58,900 --> 00:38:59,500
Oh, thank God.

386
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,920
There was no friendly fire, guys.

387
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:01,460
Thank God.

388
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,280
I just remembered.

389
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:04,600
Wait, there is?

390
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,560
Oh, no.

391
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,660
Wait, never mind.

392
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:07,780
There was friendly fire.

393
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:08,960
My mistake.

394
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:09,760
Oh, okay.

395
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:10,800
This is gonna, okay.

396
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:13,160
I don't remember, but then I remembered.

397
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:13,940
There is friendly.

398
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:24,240
fire so this is gonna be a little messy let's hope there's
only one way to find out if there's friendly fire or not but

399
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:38,520
anyway this is my team uh next up uh we have lily pichu and
the bcs so uh yes all of the bcs will be participating i

400
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:47,200
also want to do another disclaimer we warned her about how
sweaty this this tournament might be oh just a just a little

401
00:39:47,200 --> 00:40:00,600
we're not sending we're not sending a child out to die guys
we warned them also also it is a top-down shooter so like so

402
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:08,640
like if they see the person first if they see the person
first um they can they they can win the fight I believe.

403
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:08,940
Okay.

404
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,100
I believe in them.

405
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:11,580
All right.

406
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,320
I, we all love the underdog story and I believe in them.

407
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:22,420
So it is Lily Peachy, Berrybug, PFP, Tori, and Tyu.

408
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:25,300
Um, that will be on Lily Peachy's team.

409
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,120
And I believe in Lily Peachy.

410
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:32,380
I believe she can lead her team, uh, to victory and not
last.

411
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:33,500
I believe in her.

412
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:36,360
Um, but I'm not being last though.

413
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:47,420
Like if anyone has to be last, I hope I'm sorry Lily if it's
me and you and one of us has to be last I'm sorry but but

414
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:50,700

But yeah, there they are.

418
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:13,560
Yay!

419
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:24,700
I believe they are all very talented in shooters in general.

420
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:29,940
So, oh my god, there are looks maxing right now.

421
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:34,600
Yeah, from what I was told, they are gamers.

422
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,440
Gamers.

423
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:46,220
So, if it's between me and Lily P. you to be not last i am
sorry lily but i will lock in so hard i i do not want to be

team subrosa so it will be a gmdd dynamic simon fps and and

427
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:30,120
pride i do recognize uh some of the people on this team they
are all also very good at various shooter games and also

428
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:38,180
like i know like yeah all the teams are pretty stacked i
know like some of them are actually were pros in other games

429
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:44,020
so uh yeah I know that some of these are gamer gamers who
have been pro players I mean one of them is literally

430
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:53,280
wearing their jersey shirt so one of them is literally
wearing their their esports sport team so I assume they are

431
00:42:53,280 --> 00:43:04,640
all I mean the other guy has two of them have FPS in their
name so I I assume they're very good at FPS guys put FPS as

432
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:10,880
your gamer tag you you must be good at FPS because then
because then that would be that would be a little

433
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:21,940
embarrassing if you it's just there for fun um but yeah
anyway that was Subrosa's team and that was all the teams uh

434
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:32,760
all the teams for the tournament uh they were invited by the
team captains uh were invited uh by uh PUBG blind spot um

435
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:39,200
and we allowed the team captains uh to select uh the
teammates that they want to participate in this tournament

436
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:45,580
so we gave everybody a freedom on who they want to pick and

remember we figured out that um we liked it when lacrosse

00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:31,620
hair when our movement is based off where we're looking at
so i remember that.

00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:46,000
Wait, actually.

456
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:47,640

457
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:48,740

Oh, there we go.

463
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,940
As a reminder, everyone.

464
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:09,860
The tournament is at February 15th to 16th and that is on
next week on Sunday and Monday 3 p.m.

00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,720

Thank you for the super chat.

00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:33,740
Thank you.

471
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:34,280
Thank you.

472
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:42,060
But, you know, it could, you know, we could be surprised
because it is a top-down tactical shooter.

473
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:46,340
And it's usually, I feel like it's Peekers' advantage
because of it.

474
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:50,100
Because it's like whoever sees the person's first because it
is top-down.

475
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:57,500
So as long as you put, like, you know, you point your mouse
directly at someone, like, you know, they'll die.

476
00:46:58,020 --> 00:46:59,020
Like, that's...

477
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:15,000
it works so it could you know anyone can win you know we
don't know who's anyone can win guys all right let me uh oh

I was introducing the tournament

483
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:05,000
That'll be pretty awkward.

484
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:09,160
My Timmy's and Yimmy's will cheer me on.

485
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:10,780
Alright, let me see.

486
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:14,160
I'll do.

487
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,540
Flow screen window.

488
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:19,780
Where is the sensing?

489
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:20,640
Oh, there it is.

490
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:22,600
Aligning upwards.

491
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:23,740
I don't remember.

492
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:24,820
I don't know if it...

493
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:25,900
I think it rolls over.

494
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,440
Yeah, this looks like it rolled over.

495
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:32,520
Okay, and there was like... There was something that I was
just like...

496
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:41,200
on and off about and it was the where was it it was the one
where it's like wherever you're facing is where you're

497
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:53,660
shooting at show control show blackout pings I'm not sure if
it's here controls mouse or aim camera line camera rotation

498
00:48:54,940 --> 00:49:02,100

upwards manual there you go align always align curse okay

499
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:04,260

500
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:08,800
Alright, here we go.

501
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,440
We're going to do the tutorial again.

502
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:14,400
So wherever I'm facing, so this is where I can turn my
camera.

503
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:17,760
And then...

504
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:23,180
Let's...

505
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:24,320
Walk through slowly.

506
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,560
I'm walking through very slow.

507
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:29,540
Oh, there you go.

508
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:29,760
Oh.

509
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:31,920
Oh, wait.

510
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:32,880
That's crouch.

511
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:36,580
Crouching and walking through...

512
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:37,820
Wait, I changed the tutorial.

513
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:38,380
This is...

514
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:38,880
different.

515
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:44,960
There we go.

516
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:47,380
Go to the next location.

517
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:48,740
It is so slow.

518
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:49,800
What do you mean?

519
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:51,920
All right, switch to secondary.

520
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:54,780
There we go.

521
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,300
Go to the next location.

522
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:58,380
I love ruining.

523
00:49:58,480 --> 00:49:58,940
What do you mean?

524
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:02,120
All right, fire at target.

525
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:06,760
Yeah, they changed the tutorial a little bit.

526
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,000
It's different.

527
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:13,940
Oh, aim low.

528
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,480
Aim low at target area.

529
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:18,720
Too close to the wall.

530
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:20,320
What do you mean, too close to the wall?

531
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:25,200
I'm reloading.

532
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:30,720
Aim low at target.

533
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:31,660
Oh, my God.

534
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:32,780
It's so different now.

535
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:36,140
Or maybe...

536
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:38,020
Yeah, it definitely feels different.

537
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:42,590
I swear to God, I'm aiming low.

538
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:43,610
What am I doing wrong?

539
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:56,050
what am i i am pressing control this is control oh my god i
re-binded it that's why wait i remember i re-binded the

540
00:50:56,050 --> 00:51:08,690
controls i give me a sec i forgot what i bided it to it's
not them it's me i re-binded the controls i i remember now

541
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:13,230
it's like i don't understand i'm because like Control was
not crouched at first.

542
00:51:13,410 --> 00:51:14,690
And then I was like, I don't like that.

543
00:51:14,810 --> 00:51:16,870
I'm going to make it control is crouched.

544
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:19,010
And I realized, wait a minute.

545
00:51:19,830 --> 00:51:20,750
Wait a minute.

546
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:23,390
That makes more sense now.

547
00:51:27,090 --> 00:51:28,530
What was it?

548
00:51:29,070 --> 00:51:30,630
What did I put it as?

549
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:33,490
I don't remember.

550
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:35,170
It's, okay, okay.

551
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:36,950
Mouse, aim.

552
00:51:37,150 --> 00:51:38,050
Oh, it's C.

553
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:39,890
Oh my God, it was C.

554
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:43,010
Why did I put it at sea, Doki?

555
00:51:43,550 --> 00:51:45,330
It's not, it carried over.

556
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:46,910
It actually carried over.

557
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:52,470
All the past Doki's control was carried over into this game.

558
00:51:53,090 --> 00:51:58,030
Um, past Doki, why was it sea?

559
00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:00,170
I don't understand.

560
00:52:03,110 --> 00:52:04,130
All right.

561
00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:09,330
So why it did, yeah, I don't, why did I put it at sea?

562
00:52:12,050 --> 00:52:14,770
What the heck was mouse button then?

563
00:52:14,910 --> 00:52:16,570
Alright, guys, I need to rebuy my stuff.

564
00:52:16,690 --> 00:52:18,430
I don't know what Pastor Turkey was thinking.

565
00:52:20,990 --> 00:52:24,610
I don't remember what Pastor Turkey was thinking.

566
00:52:25,130 --> 00:52:27,570
What was my mouse button then?

567
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:30,530
Okay, melee attack was mouse.

568
00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:32,970
Okay, that was the mouse button.

569
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:34,990
What about the other mouse button?

570
00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:36,270
Rotate camera?

571
00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:38,570
What was I thinking?

572
00:52:42,090 --> 00:52:44,450
What was that thinking?

573
00:52:45,090 --> 00:52:46,550
Clearly I wasn't.

574
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:48,130
Alright, it's fine.

575
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:52,160
It's fine.

576
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:53,540
Alright, that means...

577
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:56,680
That means this one.

578
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:58,560
Aligning...

579
00:52:58,560 --> 00:52:59,440
Okay, here we go.

580
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:01,300
Confirm.

581
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:01,920
There we go.

582
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,180
So then that means...

583
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:03,740
There we go.

584
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:05,600
Because I liked it.

585
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,120
Yeah, CC is crouched, but I was like, Oh, I don't like that.

586
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:09,220
I'm going to change it.

587
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:10,380
Wow.

588
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:11,020
Wow.

589
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:18,600
What was past Doki thinking?

590
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:20,100
I'll never find out.

591
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,500
Alright, go to the next location.

592
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:26,560
Walk to my special gadget.

593
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:27,280
What is it?

594
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:28,700
Gash the wall.

595
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:29,980
I gash the wall?

596
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:32,020
I did it.

597
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:32,620
Yeah!

598
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,520
Okay, I'll take you in the super chat.

599
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:39,660
Thank you, thank you.

600
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:43,460
Last Doki struck again.

601
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:44,380
Alright.

602
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,460
Swatching my tactic of gadget.

603
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:47,640
Hatch my nade.

604
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:50,680
Alright, I got that.

605
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:53,100
Oh my god.

606
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:54,680
You can throw your nade so far.

607
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:56,780
I did not remember that.

608
00:53:59,020 --> 00:53:59,800
Aim great.

609
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:00,920
Your nade up.

610
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:05,520
Okay.

611
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:05,920
Okay.

612
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:08,700
Oh yeah, I remember that now.

613
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:09,640
There we go.

00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:21,700

00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:50,280
I think, yeah, I remember, like, in the end, I liked facing
towards where I'm planning on shooting.

618
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,560
I felt like that was, like, the most convenient overall.

619
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:55,780
All right, one more to go.

620
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:56,980

funny because he like messaged When I announced my

655
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:18,340
tournament, he messaged me because he thought it was the
original PUBG Battlegrounds game because he's been craving

656
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:22,320
PUBG Battlegrounds and he was wanting to, like, an actual
custom in NA.

657
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:24,720
And then he was like, oh my God, are you full?

658
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,660
Can I still, can I still enjoy it?

659
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:30,800
And I was like, Axel, I'm sorry, Axel, it's a different
game.

660
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:36,500
I was like, it's a different game.

661
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:38,400
It ain't Battle Royale, Axel.

662
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,160
It's a top-down tactical shooter.

663
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:47,600
And he's like, oh, I'm going to tot, tot, tot.

664
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:53,560
I was like, do you still want to do it?

665
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:55,380
And he was like, no.

666
00:57:57,180 --> 00:58:00,100
Because he wanted to play PUBG Battleground.

667
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:03,080
He was just craving for PUBG Battleground.

668
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:05,980
All right.

669
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:08,380
We get Buddy or Zed.

670
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:12,220
Alright, actually, he has Sticky Launcher, Drill Camera.

671
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:14,640
Oh, I'm not, I don't know how to do Intel.

672
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:16,380
I'll just buy, I'll just buy Zen.

673
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:18,480
I don't know, I'm sorry, buddy.

674
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:19,760
I'm bad at Recon.

675
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:23,560
I don't remember which one I liked the most.

676
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:25,260
You guys remember which one I played?

677
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:26,480
A lot of?

678
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:29,460
There was one character I was, like, spamming.

679
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:30,940
I think it was Panatic, right?

680
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:31,940
Because she had a Metcalfe.

681
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:34,120
Was it Panatic or who was it?

682
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,040
Go back to Batty.

683
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,340
mean buddy.

684
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:41,280
Do you guys remember which one I played?

685
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,460
Uh, the last time I played this game?

686
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:48,160
It's like, I'm trying to remember because I liked a specific
gun.

687
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:51,560
It was a specific gun that I really liked.

688
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:58,480
No, it was like, it was an aim gun.

689
00:58:59,520 --> 00:58:59,980
And the shield.

690
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,140
I remember I played him.

691
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:02,740
I remember I played him during defense.

692
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:03,260
He was...

693
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:04,780

00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:06,340

01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:52,540
It's possible.

719
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:53,700
Anybody can win.

720
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:55,060
It's Peekers' advantage.

721
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:57,080
Oh my god.

All me, guys.

739
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:22,960
All me.

740
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:26,480
All right, I'm going to go back to base, home base, to grab
HP.

741
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:28,500
There you go.

742
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:30,120
Double HP?

743
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:31,800
Oh, I don't have shields.

744
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:33,660
Look at that.

745
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:34,240
Double kill.

746
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:34,940
See?

747
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:36,600
I used my brain.

748
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:39,680
Okay, to 30.

749
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:42,860
All right, there you go.

750
01:01:45,220 --> 01:01:45,840
That's all right.

751
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:46,240
awkward.

752
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:48,160
Don't worry.

753
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:49,600
Boom.

754
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:51,580
That'll work again, surely.

755
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,400
I told you that'll work again.

756
01:02:00,730 --> 01:02:01,610
I told you.

757
01:02:01,810 --> 01:02:02,410
Oh, my God.

758
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:04,810
Oh, I know he's right there, too.

759
01:02:05,470 --> 01:02:05,910
What?

760
01:02:07,030 --> 01:02:07,870
Oh, my God.

761
01:02:08,130 --> 01:02:09,810
That shotgun was so far.

762
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:10,750
Oh, shit.

763
01:02:10,830 --> 01:02:11,030
Okay.

764
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:13,150
I'm doing my part, though.

765
01:02:13,690 --> 01:02:14,050
I did.

766
01:02:14,070 --> 01:02:15,530
I'm doing my part in this team.

767
01:02:16,350 --> 01:02:17,070

772
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:09,920
I figured it out.

773
01:03:11,380 --> 01:03:13,180
Guys, I told you I could figure this out.

774
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:17,100
Oh my god.

Come on, guys.

777
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:20,680
We just need one kill.

778
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:21,720
I cannot do everything.

779
01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:25,100
Yay.

780
01:03:29,620 --> 01:03:30,180
Yay.

781
01:03:33,620 --> 01:03:35,020

782
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:38,720
Yay.

783
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:40,960
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

784
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:44,220
Yeah, I was gonna say, I'm pretty sure.

785
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:46,220
Most skills, most damage dealt.

786
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:49,040
10 by 10, by 10, by the way.

787
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:51,920
By, look, it took me a while to get started.

788
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:53,680
It took me a while to get started.

789
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:58,920
But like, after I figured it out, guys, after I figured it
out, I locked in.

790
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,140
I locked in.

791
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:05,280
We have someone with 7% accuracy.

792
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:07,520
At least they're not on my team.

793
01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:08,700
They're not on my team.

794
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:27,520

Okay, I got it.

844
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:03,880
I'm gonna throw the motion sensor right here.

845
01:08:04,140 --> 01:08:05,880
So we get flanked.

846
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:08,060
If we get flanked, then I'll know.

847
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:10,760
Alright, where are we going?

848
01:08:13,140 --> 01:08:14,420
I follow Lou.

849
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:17,840
Also, why the heck was he over there?

850
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:22,540
Home your blind spot so you don't get maxed out.

851
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:26,360
I'm so scared.

852
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:29,020
I'm so paranoid of friendly fire now, guys.

853
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:32,240
I'm so paranoid.

854
01:08:32,780 --> 01:08:35,300
I feel like I'm going to actually shoot my team.

855
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:38,960
See?

856
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:40,880
Alright, here we go.

857
01:08:44,630 --> 01:08:45,850
Did he just flash himself?

858
01:08:48,770 --> 01:08:50,710
You wanted a challenge, guys.

859
01:08:50,810 --> 01:08:51,850
You don't understand.

860
01:08:52,390 --> 01:08:52,730
Here we go.

861
01:08:52,850 --> 01:08:53,890
You have the hammer.

862
01:08:55,530 --> 01:08:55,690
Jesus.

863
01:08:56,890 --> 01:08:58,550
Alright, there's no one there this time.

864
01:08:59,610 --> 01:09:00,870
Oh my god.

865
01:09:01,170 --> 01:09:01,730
Oh my god.

866
01:09:05,820 --> 01:09:07,700
I mean, I could still shoot it.

867
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:09,800
Like, it's not like...

868
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:11,980
I could still shoot this.

869
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:13,920
Like, it's not like, you know...

870
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:14,980
Wait, he's dead, right?

871
01:09:15,380 --> 01:09:16,480
The colors are gone.

872
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:21,880
Back up a bit.

873
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:22,840
Alright, don't worry.

874
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:24,340
They'll never know.

875
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:34,220
Don't worry.

876
01:09:34,580 --> 01:09:35,520
Motion sensor!

877
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:39,800
They'll never see...

878
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:41,120
Oh, my God, they saw.

879
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:44,460
Grenade out.

880
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:45,720
though.

881
01:09:47,260 --> 01:09:48,140
I lost my sensor.

882
01:09:48,620 --> 01:09:48,900
Don't worry.

883
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:49,480
Don't never.

884
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:50,620
I got the second sensor.

885
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:51,200
Oh, there you go.

886
01:09:52,180 --> 01:09:52,700
See?

887
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:55,460
They never expect a second sensor.

888
01:09:56,620 --> 01:09:57,080
Oh, shit.

889
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:05,520
Guys, I'm scared.

890
01:10:08,260 --> 01:10:09,100
Wait, I have bomb.

891
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:10,160
My bad.

892
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:14,260
Wait, no, everyone has bomb, right?

893
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:15,320
What's that thing?

894
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:26,360
Are I planting?

895
01:10:29,180 --> 01:10:33,960

Yay!

901
01:11:06,980 --> 01:11:09,240
Wait, that motion sensor goes hard though.

902
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:10,640
Wait, I figured it out.

903
01:11:13,820 --> 01:11:14,420
No, no, no.

904
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:16,840
I was the backup flag.

905
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:19,900
I couldn't shoot because he was in front of me.

906
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:23,020
What if I shot my team, guys?

907
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:28,580
Like, guys, I could have shot my team.

908
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:31,540
I was trying to not shoot him.

909
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:35,820
Because there's friendly fire.

910
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:37,800
I got scared.

911
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:39,680
I got scared.

912
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:44,200
If he dies.

913
01:11:44,260 --> 01:11:47,820
Yeah, see, I practice restraint, chat.

914
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:52,320
I practice restraint in not accidentally killing my team.

915
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:54,100
And that's all that matters.

916
01:11:55,420 --> 01:11:59,720
I have to be able to restrain myself before the tournament.

917
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:07,240
All right, this is a new attack now.

918
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:08,200

And then...

943
01:14:00,410 --> 01:14:02,090

Oh my god.

1018
01:19:10,110 --> 01:19:12,810
I looked out at the window one time.

1019
01:19:13,210 --> 01:19:14,290
I don't even get to crawl.

1020
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:18,930
I don't even get the privilege to crawl.

1021
01:19:20,290 --> 01:19:22,010

1022
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:32,840

01:19:34,620 --> 01:19:37,660
Oh, that guy's crazy.

1024
01:19:37,740 --> 01:19:39,600
Oh my god, the Jiggle Peaks, though.

1025
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:44,920
It's okay, my team can carry me.

1026
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:48,440
I believe in my team.

1027

01:19:55,660 --> 01:19:56,760
Wait, that is so smart.

1031
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:57,960
Write this down.

1032
01:19:58,320 --> 01:19:59,780
Guys, write this down for my tournament.

1033
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:02,860
Wait, that is so smart.

1034
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:04,880
Why is this face?

1035
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:08,520
The pawn plant is next to the window.

1036
01:20:08,940 --> 01:20:09,660
Guys, write this down.

1037
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:12,020
I will choose this map so I can plant right here.

1038
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:12,380
Okay.

1039
01:20:17,780 --> 01:20:20,180
I will plan it right here.

1040
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,520
Guys, write this down so I won't be last place.

1041
01:20:25,460 --> 01:20:27,040
The coolest not last.

1042
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:31,080
Oh my god, my team is smart.

1043
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:34,180
The enemy can do...

1044
01:20:34,180 --> 01:20:36,760
Yeah, but if we do it first, it'll be different.

1045
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:41,240
Guys, I don't think Hammer Boy is good in this map.

1046
01:20:41,540 --> 01:20:41,920
Maybe.

1047
01:20:48,950 --> 01:20:49,930
Yeah, no...

1048
01:20:49,950 --> 01:20:59,830
sell platen your windows i have a feeling that maybe maybe
hammer boy might not be great for this particular area oh

1049
01:20:59,830 --> 01:21:03,870
that guy's level eight already i might need more than a
habit

1050
01:21:10,830 --> 01:21:18,550
all right see you guys but i'm figuring it out slowly but
sure i'm relearning the game for next week slowly but surely

1051
01:21:18,550 --> 01:21:20,970
it will work out eventually

1052
01:21:24,970 --> 01:21:26,750
risk I'm willing to take.

1053
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:34,140
Alright, I'm going to believe in my team to show me the way.

1054
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:36,780
Reloading, cover me.

1055
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:37,740
I have motion.

1056
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:38,140
Oh, wait.

1057
01:21:38,380 --> 01:21:39,720
Is that same bad spot?

1058
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:40,040
No.

1059
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:42,360
Oh my god, it is.

1060
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:50,360
There you go.

1061
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:51,100
There's no way.

1062
01:21:54,260 --> 01:21:56,600
Oh my god, they're fracking out.

1063
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:10,740
That's crazy.

1064
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:12,660
I literally looked up one second.

1065
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:13,600
Oh

1066
01:22:16,700 --> 01:22:18,640

1067
01:22:20,140 --> 01:22:21,140
I'm scared, guys.

1068
01:22:22,340 --> 01:22:29,060
He's like, come on, you got this.

1069
01:22:32,020 --> 01:22:35,340
I have to be

1070
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:44,400
the smartest shit I ever done.

1071
01:22:49,110 --> 01:22:49,670
What the fuck?

1072
01:22:49,870 --> 01:22:50,250

1073
01:22:50,630 --> 01:22:51,630
He fucking crouched!

1074
01:22:51,850 --> 01:22:53,150
So I'm going to shoot at him!

1075
01:22:53,530 --> 01:22:54,030

1076
01:22:56,370 --> 01:22:57,490
He crouched!

1077
01:22:58,150 --> 01:22:59,490
Oh my god!

1078
01:23:00,130 --> 01:23:01,050

1085
01:23:18,050 --> 01:23:19,090
And then he started crouching.

1086
01:23:19,110 --> 01:23:19,870
crouching.

1087
01:23:20,090 --> 01:23:21,950
The crouch technique.

1088
01:23:23,950 --> 01:23:26,170

1091
01:23:32,910 --> 01:23:35,890
His entire body was fucking crouched.

1092
01:23:38,750 --> 01:23:40,170
Just, okay, now I know.

01:23:40,490 --> 01:23:41,970

Oh, my God.

1161
01:30:05,110 --> 01:30:08,390
It truly is a blind spot.

1162
01:30:10,430 --> 01:30:16,350
I'm actually, I'm like trying, I'm full screenplay on my
OBS, trying to make this work, guys.

1163
01:30:16,610 --> 01:30:17,730
I really am.

1164
01:30:22,610 --> 01:30:28,590
My monitor had to go into maintenance mode at the last
second.

1165
01:30:29,150 --> 01:30:30,430
I'm sorry.

1166
01:30:35,510 --> 01:30:37,370
It's so tiny.

1167
01:30:38,170 --> 01:30:40,830
Everything is so tiny on the screen.

1168
01:30:43,170 --> 01:30:44,130
It's okay.

1169
01:30:44,350 --> 01:30:45,410
We can make this work.

1170
01:30:46,230 --> 01:30:48,990
If we lose this because I don't even have my monitor on.

1171
01:30:49,170 --> 01:30:51,490
I legitimately have the perfect excuse chat.

1172
01:30:52,010 --> 01:30:52,370
I don't.

1173
01:30:52,550 --> 01:30:54,750
My monitor is off.

1174
01:30:57,570 --> 01:31:00,730
Guys, I have actually the perfect excuse.

1175
01:31:01,310 --> 01:31:02,930
My monitor is off.

1176
01:31:07,730 --> 01:31:09,890
Monitor, please come back.

1177
01:31:10,410 --> 01:31:13,870
Because I don't think the monitor is coming back.

1178
01:31:14,570 --> 01:31:16,070
I don't think so.

1179
01:31:22,090 --> 01:31:28,790
I'm gonna lock my oh wait actually Razor wires down

1180
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:39,220
Oh my god I don't feel so good

1181
01:31:45,690 --> 01:31:53,310

1182
01:31:58,230 --> 01:32:00,410
feel like I'm heading back

1183
01:32:03,700 --> 01:32:05,460
Oh my god It's okay.

1184
01:32:05,540 --> 01:32:06,320
