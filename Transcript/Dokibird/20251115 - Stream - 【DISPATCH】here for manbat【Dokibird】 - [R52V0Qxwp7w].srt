1
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,530
Do I sound okay?

2
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,150
Do I look okay?

3
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:52,570
Like I'm such a mess right now.

4
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:53,590
Hello, hello.

5
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:55,590
Any echo?

6
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:57,270
Is it echoey?

7
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:57,930
Is it better?

8
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,670
Oh, I sound.

9
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:03,970
Okay, no echo.

10
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,010
Oh, thank God.

11
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:05,770
Okay, okay.

12
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:06,990
I sound the same.

13
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:07,430
Okay.

14
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,490
So I got, oh my God, I got soundproofing done.

15
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:15,450
So, um, that's why I had to, um, I had to push back a little bit.

16
00:02:15,470 --> 00:03:27,510
little bit so well it was not more than a little bit but I got soundproofing done um in my office so um that's why I had to push it back because it did take a while so that means if I get a noise like we had we had this thing where it's like this little rectangular thing and there's like a little fluffy mic thing where it checks like the decibel of um of like oh it's a little bit of echo don't worry I'll just throw some I'll just grab a buy a carpet or something by a rug or something um so so you know like those like things that uh you can check how loud you are the decibel thing so if i get a noise complaint no no i don't know they're like right up to my door or so they're either the it might have been like a goddamn plot twist and like um and my the people that were actually complaining was like my my like downstairs neighbor or some shit like i don't at that point because I can't obviously I can't soundproof the floor so like if I get a noise complaint uh from somebody it had it's

17
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:48,930
like a plot shows it's actually my downstairs neighbor um it was never it wasn't even my next door neighbor it was actually my downstairs neighbor like so so if that's the case then I'm fucked uh so yes I finally got soundproof done um So that means I will be able to,

18
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:51,550
I will be able to do my 5 a.m.

19
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:52,590
streams, I hope.

20
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:54,070
I hope.

21
00:03:55,230 --> 00:04:01,310
But also, I was struggling a bit because I actually broke my monitor.

22
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,330
I broke one of my monitors.

23
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:06,790
So I'm working with two monitors for today.

24
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,470
But don't worry, I do have another monitor.

25
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:15,450
I do have an Xpair third monitor for just in case the monitor.

26
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:45,790
breaks um it was like it was very unfortunate um i think i asked i was i had to like um sorry i'm like my my mind is so frazzled right now so i can't do words right now i can't like fucking i also hit okay guys don't be too don't be like are you okay like do you think i was like don't you please also might have hit my head a little bit um the top of my head a little bit because i hit I bumped my head into something but I'm okay I think I'm okay

27
00:04:49,850 --> 00:05:57,490
I'm okay because I was like try okay so what happened was I was trying to take my monitor I was trying to well not my monitor I was trying to like connect something to the back of my desk and then I hit my um I hit the the corner the monitor like hit my the top of my head because I was trying to unplug something um that's not why it broke though that's not I don't know maybe that's why i broke because my head was just so fucking solid um um anyway so uh so my monitor can't turn on anymore it turns on but you know like the fail safe where it would like automatically turn off right away so so uh so whenever i try to turn the monitor on it just goes and then it just turns off right away like i don't fucking know what to do so we're running on two monitors right now until like i get my third monitor plugged back in uh so yep that's really it it's not i don't know i tried i was like maybe it's the plugs maybe it's like the cable i tried like three different cables it's none of it worked so

28
00:05:57,490 --> 00:07:01,630
um i think it i don't know maybe it's something inside fucked up because it just instantly turns off on itself so i do have another I have another monitor right now as my main monitor so um it's very weird because it's a it's different from my usual monitor uh because at first it was like oh do you want to run it the recommended resolution which was like 3000 or some shit and I was like sure and I clicked on the 3000 and um and then like everything enlarged you guys were like what the fuck do you mean dokey okay so and all my stuff on my OBS so I'll show you guys what I mean so um obviously the oh wait what okay there you go obviously this is the recommended resolution that they wanted me to put in and then where did I go where did I go on the OBS but then if I put on the one below that um I get

29
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:17,270
So, I don't want to, I don't know, I can't be bothered resizing all, because I actually have to resize everything if I want to, if I want to do the recommended resolution.

30
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,610
And I can't be bothered.

31
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,910
I'm so used to what everything looks like.

32
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:32,410
So, you know, like, I don't know, it fucks with me if like one thing changes, like that size wise, or like if I'm like a little bit to the left, it like fucks with me a lot.

33
00:07:35,850 --> 00:08:36,610
where I was for so long that like I just don't like change I just don't like change change is bad Anthony thank you for the super chat thank you thank you peak v2 replace peak game I'm gonna love this eating thank you the super chat thank you thank you uh damn that noggin is dense hollow but dense blue to damn my hair up thank you for the super chat thank you thank you um so I don't know I don't there's so many things I'm all over the place right now I had to wake up so early too for the soundproofing and stuff so I got the consultation for sound like the quotes and consultation the day before and I also had to wake up super early for that and they're like we can do it get it done tomorrow I was like sweet and then and then obviously I have to wake up super early again to have them do the soundproofing and everything so I'm all over the place right now I'm not I'm not mentally there and I also hit my head too like I'm okay I'm okay um I'm okay guys,

34
00:08:36,670 --> 00:09:01,490
don't worry But yeah, so So I'm just like all over the place By the way, some people were like Is she gonna play the censored or the non-censored Version of this patch So the thing is No, there's no bump I like touched the top of my head And there's no like,

35
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:33,770
it's not like you know there's no bump on my head so i think i'm okay um but anyway so apparently there is a censored and a non-censored version and then um i asked one of my friends who's like fucking obsessed with dispatch right now because i was like okay how bad is non-censored and then they were like oh yeah at the beginning like i was like okay do i see an actual penis because i That's fine,

36
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,010
but I need a no, do I see?

37
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,610
Is it just there?

38
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:41,750
Is it just there?

39
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,890
Because that's when YouTube's like, no, no, no.

40
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:58,050
Because boobs, for some reason, boobs, because I don't know if you guys know this on YouTube, but it allows you to see certain nudity because they'll just be like, it's educational or it's just part of the game.

41
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:02,010
But the moment there's a dick, that's when YouTube's like, no.

42
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:05,370
Peepies are not allowed.

43
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:11,590
So, so I'm like, okay, how bad is it?

44
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:16,010
So, because apparently dicks aren't educational.

45
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:29,810
So, so my friend was like, showed me a clip of the first, I guess, like 20 seconds, like the intro, where you see the back of the peepie.

46
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,690
And I was like, that's not bad.

47
00:10:32,530 --> 00:11:03,730
wet like it's these and then my friend was like oh yeah no that's not the worst part no it shows the full-on pee-pee later on i'm like oh okay that's bad that's bad guys we the thing is i can't have another video get striped r18 guys you know what happens um uh but no the thing is the thing is i'm pretty sure i don't know jacksepticeye's rod might be r18 because you know what striped as R18,

48
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:07,830
my Garfield, sorry, Docafield, Jim, don't come after me.

49
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:09,010
It's a parody.

50
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:14,450
My Docafield Halloween stream got marked as R18.

51
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:17,110
So I can't do it again.

52
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:24,910
Because if you have too many streams marked as R18, YouTube actually fucks with your algorithm.

53
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:30,210
So we can't do that again.

54
00:11:30,570 --> 00:12:03,030
I don't want down on me um so i'm pretty sure like i think get away with this on twitch but like on youtube like i don't think i can get away with it uh but uh but i think i don't know if jack's vibe yeah jack i'm tight with him like that i caught him by his first name uh i don't know if jack septica's uh stream of uh of dispatch um was marked as r.n 18.

55
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,010
I'm not sure.

56
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:05,470
Can anyone vouch?

57
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,010
Sorry, my bro Sean.

58
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:08,670
Oh yeah.

59
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,290
God, I'm sorry.

60
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:11,430
Sean, I forgot.

61
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,250
His name isn't Jack.

62
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:17,670
He likes it when we call him Jack.

63
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:24,670
So is his stream or video?

64
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,750
I don't know if he does the let's play.

65
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:30,510
Marked R 18 because I'm not bad dealing with that.

66
00:12:30,610 --> 00:13:03,530
I'm not dealing with r18 guys it is but i also think i also think he got away with he gets away with it because you know um i also oh okay it's a video okay i also think he gets away with it because he's literally like og youtube and he's part of the game and i think if i try to stream non-censored um i don't know how You take me.

67
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:10,270
He is a bigger streamer.

68
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:12,750
I don't think I matter to YouTube.

69
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,390
There's birds and bees.

70
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:16,150
Thank you.

71
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:16,770
Thank you, Super Chat.

72
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:17,510
Thank you, thank you.

73
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:21,690
Other than that, I have no idea what Dispatch really is.

74
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:24,090
I've heard people saying that it's sort of like Telltale.

75
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:28,750
It's like a Telltale game, so it's just watching cutscenes and walking around, which is great.

76
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,010
I don't have to do much.

77
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:59,370
with extra steps so that's cool that's fine i think i don't know if i'm gonna do all the way till the end um uh so yeah and apparently it's made by telltale devs too so the only also the other thing that i know about this batch is um you mean temporary planet but you plan forever i've been saying that like like at least once a day that's like that's my new That's my vocal stim.

78
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:00,370
It's so good.

79
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:05,110
I just love how she's like bitch you plan forever It's so good.

80
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:06,850
I don't even know the context.

81
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:13,510
I just love like the delivery for that is just so fucking good I don't even know what's going on.

82
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:20,170
I'm just like bitch you plan forever and I just keep saying that I don't know I would say it randomly too.

83
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,970
I would just be like I'd just be whacking daddy.

84
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:35,470
I'd be like fuck you be temporary blinded bitch you plan forever just by myself just it's just it rolls off the tugs so well it's my new brain ride like

85
00:14:39,430 --> 00:15:29,530
yeah so um like it's just i don't know it i just love i don't know i just fucking love that that line is the delivery is just that good uh i'm actually brainrider yeah i thought you were addicted to ira gotcha papa smirk thank you for this super chat thank you thank you not in the expense of my job this is my career i can't i can't get my channel like this is what shuts my channel down like a random pp uh simple minded thank you for the super chat thank you thank you joki think of the possibilities 18 plus hell yeah let's go thank you the super chat thank you thank you anyway so that is all the things I know about this patch,

86
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:45,950
so, uh, sorry, I apologize for starting late today, um, but, you know, I finally got soundproofing, I went through a lot of technical difficulties, but, you know, I finally got soundproofing, though, so, like, you know, good for future streams, at least,

87
00:15:46,070 --> 00:16:07,430
yeah, um, um, so, yeah, we're just gonna, we're gonna try it out today, I don't know if I'm gonna do, um, do all the episodes, I looked up that, you know, it's like eight hours long and I don't know if I'm ready for an eight hour playthrough For today,

88
00:16:07,990 --> 00:17:28,430
so we'll see if we get to episode four and then I'm like, you know what I'm ready Then then we'll maybe we'll do eight hours So we'll see if I we'll see we'll see anyway Also another reason why I want to play this game is for man bat for furry of the he is the he is the wild the wild dark horse for the furry of the year contender uh for those who don't know the context so every year there so for those who need context don't worry i explained this before on the batman stream which was very appropriate uh let me pull up the year they would every year um they would select one furry for the hot furry of the year uh and right now it is between man bat and and i don't remember it's another wolf it's it's it's another wolf i don't fucking know so apparently man bat Charlie,

89
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:35,190
Boys Critical, is like the one to end the cycle, the wolf cycle.

90
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:41,610
And everyone's trying to figure out who is going to be 2025 Fury of the Year.

91
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:47,310
Will it be another dog?

92
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:50,530
Or will it be a bat?

93
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:52,970
The Raid of Wolf.

94
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:56,890
Will the Raid of Wolfmen end this year?

95
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:34,330
you with the super chat thank you thank you so we're gonna find out if the cycle will end so i vote for charlie's persona so that's the other thing i know about um about this fact the craziest thing is that i knew about man bad because i saw this pn because i saw that viral tweet on twitter being like please end the wolf cycle We must vote for ManBat to be this year's furry of the year.

96
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,950
And that's how I knew about ManBat.

97
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:39,950
And I was like, wait, that guy's from this batch out.

98
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:46,930
That's the only reason why I knew about ManBat.

99
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,310
It's like, break the cycle.

100
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,710
Damn, the sonar situation is crazy, guys.

101
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,530
I also love all the videos.

102
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:59,210
I love Spineapples.

103
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:05,410
If you guys know who Spineapple is, she's like a really famous animator for TF2 before.

104
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:09,830
Like she would make like lots of amazing, dumb, funny Team Fortress 2 animations.

105
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:20,590
And then she did like one for where she like basically took like moist critical clips and then like animated to like the Mechamac situation.

106
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:21,630
It's crazy.

107
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:22,990
It's so good.

108
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,830
I'll link it to you guys who doesn't want to see it.

109
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,690
Spine, I love Spineapples.

110
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:58,650

111
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,270
Do you think I can get a quick happy birthday?

112
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:01,310
Of course you can.

113
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,310
Happy birthday to you.

114
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:05,330
Happy birthday to you.

115
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,470
Happy birthday, dear Jakarta.

116
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,930
Happy birthday to you.

117
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,350
Yeah, happy birthday.

118
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:13,430
Yeah, yippee.

119
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:16,550
All right, guys, let's play some Dispatch.

120
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:19,370
Oh, God, it's so weird having two monitors right now.

121
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:21,650
All right, I got to move this to my...

122
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,010
Oh, my God.

123
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:24,750
Okay, this is so weird.

124
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,110
I got to figure out how to...

125
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:28,170
I have to move all of this.

126
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:29,590
All right.

127
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:35,070
Thing is, I'll be changing this monitor, the main monitor, to a different monitor again, too.

128
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:37,770
So it's going to be all over the place.

129
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:38,290
All right.

130
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:41,490
Don't block my dispatch.

131
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:43,210
All right.

132
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:44,170
Dispatch.

133
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:44,550
All right.

134
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:44,910
All right.

135
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,250
This is my, uh, Doki is my blonde blazer.

136
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:48,330
Who's blonde blazer?

137
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:51,770
I'm definitely going to make the worst choices ever, and you're all going to yell at me.

138
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:52,730
I can feel it.

139
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:56,350
Because, like, whenever I make choices, I'm going to.

140
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:58,990
I'm like, what's the funniest choice?

141
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:03,550
Not the, what's the funniest choice out there?

142
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:11,070
Not the one that makes the most sense or like trying to be about empathy or some shit.

143
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,570
Who the fuck cares about that?

144
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:16,430
I'm, I had to be a good person in real life, okay?

145
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:21,570
Like, why would I be a good person in a video game?

146
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,270
That's what real life is for.

147
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:28,050
It's video games was for me to do the things I'm not supposed to do in real life.

148
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,310
This is gonna be good.

149
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:33,470
Sombard, thank you for the super chat.

150
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:34,730
Thank you, thank you.

151
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:35,370
It's rape.

152
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:39,270
Let my intrusive thoughts go wild because there's no consequences.

153
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:43,550
All right.

154
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:48,110
I hope any of my sound guide people are alive.

155
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:50,450
I did start a little late than usual.

156
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:51,290
All right.

157
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,070
Settings.

158
00:21:56,510 --> 00:22:02,250
Okay, quick time, events, unlimited hacking attempts, language, English.

159
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:04,130
Okay, we gotta get subtitles in.

160
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:06,550
All right, on speaker's name.

161
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:07,370
Yes, please.

162
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:09,670
I might forget who they are.

163
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:11,770
I need background.

164
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:12,830
No, I don't need it.

165
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:14,950
Replace licensed music.

166
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:16,630
We don't care about profanity.

167
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:18,790
I need visual censorship, though.

168
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,310
Like, other than...

169
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,950
We don't care about...

170
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:38,770
I don't care about like license music at best they take my monetization, but like visual censorship I ain't getting like R18 here Nathan and or do not welcome to tomato farm welcome well.

171
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:57,170

Oh, wait, maybe.

174
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:03,550
Maybe we should have a little bit of a background, actually.

175
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,870
Yeah, actually, we'll have, we'll, fuck it.

176
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:11,350
We can sort of read that.

177
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:11,930
All right.

178
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:16,510
Okay, visual.

179
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:18,010
Yep, everything is good.

180
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,610
Yep, this all looks good.

181
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:21,670

My nose is bleeding.

186
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:03,810
Thought I was getting emotionally snotty.

187
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:06,070
No, it's probably from when I kicked him in my face.

188
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:07,050
Oh, shit.

189
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:07,450
What?

190
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,610
I was like, Oh my God, am I okay?

191
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:11,910
Did I get a concussion?

192
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:13,090
Okay, more upbeats.

00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:14,090

Yeah, thanks for reminding me.

00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:19,070
So, here's what's gonna happen.

196
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:19,870
He's letting down.

197
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:20,810
Yeah, I noticed that.

198
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:22,970
What?

199
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:31,410
You're gonna tell me where Shroud is or the FPS guy just turn on twitch Soothing good.

200
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,510
Wait, am I a superhero?

201
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:53,850
You're pretty easy to talk to but the I was like the Shroud guy on twitch I'm not telling you shit you fucking loser see this is more like how I thought this was this is still super quiet Bro Shroud kills like I know he does in game, but 100.

202
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:55,070
All right.

203
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:56,490
Oh, dialogue boost.

204
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:57,430
Okay, how about that?

205
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:58,250
That should work.

206
00:25:58,450 --> 00:25:59,130
I knew it.

207
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:05,090
I knew that he was aim was way too good, guys.

208
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:09,990
Like, I hope he fucking spanks your little daddy as you bitch ass.

209
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:10,370
Yeah.

210
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:12,590
Are we outside?

211
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:13,930
Windy up here tonight.

212
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:15,190
Why are we outside?

213
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:16,970
I'm not a good person.

214
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:18,730
Smells like outside smells.

215
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:21,290
Oh, shit.

216
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:22,830
I have neighbors.

217
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:27,210
Use your inside voice and just tell me where Shroud is.

218
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:27,970
Okay, okay.

219
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:29,930
Steel mill.

220
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:32,070
Llewellyn's steelworks, okay?

221
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:32,970
Fuck.

222
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:34,170
You sure about that?

223
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:34,990
Yes, please.

224
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:35,890
That's all I know.

225
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:36,950
Stop screaming.

226
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:39,790
I want to get Batman to do stuff like this.

227
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:43,590
Hey, I will pull you up if you quiet the fuck down.

228
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:44,790
Oh, shit.

229
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:47,610
Okay, you don't bite the hat of someone that's carrying you.

230
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:48,630
Let him drop.

231
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:49,310
Fuck it.

232
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:55,150
Sir, if you want something to scream about, He gave me the intel, right?

233
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:56,470
Goodbye.

234
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:58,310
Yay.

235
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:02,070
Oh, he's alive?

236
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:03,470
Oh, shit.

237
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:08,650
Hey, I ruined a perfectly good mattress to make sure you didn't die.

238
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:09,970
Okay, you're welcome.

239
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:19,410
Okay, to be fair, he already gave me the information so that I don't need to keep him alive.

240
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:22,550
Oh, maybe a superhero is killed.

241
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,730
We won't get a lot of villains.

242
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:28,390
Like, that's all I'm saying.

243
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:35,830
Maybe we'll have less villains if we started killing villains.

244
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:44,610
How is he going to remember that?

245
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,430
I technically saved his life.

246
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:48,910
I put him in a mattress.

247
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,250
Bring the music down.

248
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:01,190
Sure, I'll bring the music down.

249
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:03,730
music.

250
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:04,770
I'll put it at 90.

251
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:12,650
I might... Do I even have superpowers, or I'm just like...

252
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:14,950
Do I just built this mecha suit for myself?

253
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,380
No need for Arkham.

254
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,120
You got super jokie, but you're getting rid of all the super villains.

255
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:29,900
Exactly!

256
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:30,540
Jakarta.

257
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,480
Thank you, the super chat.

258
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:31,800
Thank you.

259
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:32,440
Thank you.

260
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,740
What happens if I don't do my quick time event?

261
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:39,720
Okay, I...

262
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:46,820
Jesus Christ, we're doom scrolling right now.

263
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:50,720
Like, I'm like, is this necessary?

264
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,520
Like, I don't keep, please.

265
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:54,940
Am I just Iron Man?

266
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,740
All I'm saying is that, oh, my game crashed.

267
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:12,000
Okay, well, I found out apparently if you don't do your quick time event, your dispatch crashes.

268
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:13,140
Okay.

269
00:29:13,280 --> 00:30:15,080
okay all right i guess we go back in i who would have thought it couldn't do that you have said thank you put in the super chat thank you thank you my best friend was boomed by a crazy avian bounty hunter in front of me to do super villain numbers the first thing i'm doing is making that my super villain origin no i have to oh my god okay all right here we go again it's just when you add obviously it feels a little less obvious so all right i'll ask again all right feel about your father okay so maybe it's a little more he's got i mean i could have asked something new it's completely understandable i could skip it in the scene select it didn't let me look he's gone that's a bit of an understatement yeah i can't skip it so well he's more than try drop him again it's like i never dropped him the most gone Just so sensitive.

270
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,920
Listen, if I didn't love him, we wouldn't be here, right?

271
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,540
We don't have to get into it.

272
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:23,120
Oh, wait, he was trying to give me a therapy session, too.

273
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,260
Why would I be trying to find a man who killed him if I didn't love him?

274
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,100
Why would I be doing any of this?

275
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,300
Ugh, shit.

276
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:30,580
My nose is bleeding.

277
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:31,940
Thought I was getting...

278
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:34,100
Yeah, twice as though that I don't regret it.

279
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,980
It's probably from when I kicked you in the face.

280
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,260
He did kick me.

281
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,420
He did kick me.

282
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,380
Here's what's gonna happen.

283
00:30:43,280 --> 00:31:14,160
of this building and you're going to tell me yeah just to show you guys i i still i don't regret it come on i thought we were having a breakthrough hey we did you know we're being a real piece of you're pretty easy to talk to but the only oh yeah i found out on twitter apparently um none of all the videos are pre-rendered um they're all pre-rendered so you none of the models are in any of the files and all the gooners were like so depressed Are we outside?

284
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,500
Wendy up here tonight.

285
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,680
Why are we outside?

286
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,320
They couldn't get the models.

287
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,860
So all the Gooners were still sad.

288
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,380
They're like, what's the point?

289
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,440
I have neighbors.

290
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,500
Use your inside voice and just tell me.

291
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,120
That's messed up.

292
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,720
All I have to say is Gooners make the game alive.

293
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,380
Steel mill.

294
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,500
Llewellyn Steel works, okay?

295
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:38,500
Fuck.

296
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,660
You sure about that?

297
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:40,400
Yes, please.

298
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,300
That's all I know.

299
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,420
Stop screaming.

300
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,180
God damn it.

301
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:47,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey, I will pull you up.

302
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,900
Sam, thank you for the super chat.

303
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:49,780
Thank you, thank you.

304
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:50,340
Thank you.

305
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:50,680
Thank you, thank you.

306
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,000
Thank you.

307
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,160
Game was like, okay, if you don't want to play the game, then there won't be a game for you to play.

308
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,120
I doomed scroll too far.

309
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,720
No, no, no, no, no.

310
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:08,170
Of course.

311
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,290
Of course I'll still drop him.

312
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:14,050
I ruined a perfectly good mattress to make sure you didn't die.

313
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:14,510
Okay.

314
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:16,550
That's crazy that I didn't really.

315
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:45,280
realize um that the main character is voiced by uh Jesse Jesse I'm sorry what's his real name I don't even remember because it it sort of sounds like him but also does not sound like him yeah Aaron Paul yeah oh yeah I was gonna up the volume a little bit more all right let me know if that's better

316
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,980
Jesse, we need a dispatch.

317
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:55,820
Yeah, it's pretty good.

318
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,480
I didn't like him in Invincible.

319
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:02,540
I think his voice acting in Invincible was like pretty dull.

320
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,280
Fun.

321
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,260
Yeah, he was the Pyreplex.

322
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:15,700
I wasn't like a fan of his voice acting Pyreplex.

323
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:24,170
Alright, sorry.

324
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:25,370
No more Doom scrolling.

325
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,310
He was really good in Bojack, yeah.

326
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:32,070
Apparently, I can't doom scroll anymore.

327
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:36,050
Oh, shit.

328
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:39,750
What happens if I don't?

329
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:44,150
Still did it.

330
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:45,130
Still got it.

331
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:46,370
Thanks, game.

332
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:49,890
I think they just didn't animate a different scene for it.

333
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,670
I mean, it still worked.

334
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:57,970
What happens if I...

335
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:16,110

337
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,500
I'm so good at hacking.

338
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,080
This clearly reflects IRL hacking too.

339
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:41,790
What am I waiting for?

340
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:44,330
Waiting on final breach?

341
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:45,600
Where is it?

342
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:49,210
Breaching?

343
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,160
What am I waiting?

344
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,060
Oh, shit.

345
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,580
The mouse button is above me.

346
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:03,900
I'm doing it.

347
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,120
I'm doing it.

348
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:08,580
Sorry, I was looking I was looking down.

349
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:14,080
Hacking is so easy, guys.

350
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,180
It's so easy.

351
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,080
Can I die in this game?

352
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:39,520
Like, if I fail too many QuickTime events?

353
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,340
It's over, Shroud.

354
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,160
Can I get a copy of that video when we're through here?

355
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:49,800
Because it's over, Shroud.

356
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,200
That's right.

357
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,420
Nice to watch that back at a different angle.

358
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,320
That's right, Shroud.

359
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,740
I'm aiming for you.

360
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,420
I'll be the next FPS streamer.

361
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,640
Killer and you come in here with that lame shit.

362
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:04,500
Yeah, where the fuck is Shroud?

363
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,420
Yeah, where is Shroud?

364
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,060
Is he still streaming our creators?

365
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,740
After our conversation, I asked him about your dad.

366
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,180
Fun little tidbit.

367
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,520
He was very well hydrated.

368
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:18,480
Turns out right after Shroud shot him in the chest, your dad pissed his pants.

369
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,200
Bet you didn't know that, huh?

370
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,940
Yes, sir, he's too busy playing our creators right now.

371
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:27,980
He still had enough time to know how absolutely fucked he was.

372
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,320
Just pissed himself like a little bitch.

373
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,160
It was like so much.

374
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:33,500
Hunter's stomping.

375
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:34,800
Because your dad was wearing shorts.

376
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,140
Hey, just kept...

377
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:36,700
I get it.

378
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:37,500
Oh, shit.

379
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,340
Oh, shit.

380
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:42,680
Like, foot...

381
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,940
Oh, I should have stomped him.

382
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,980
If I knew...

383
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,360
Oh, this is the Mechamand situation.

384
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,320
Wait, I'm mecha man.

385
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,780
I understand now.

386
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,060
Sorry, I didn't think I didn't need to waste a perfectly good mattress to break your fall.

387
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,180
Perfectly good.

388
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,520
I assume that it comes to the thing was already in the dumpster.

389
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,840
Can we just skip to the part where you...

390
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,520
How is he alive?

391
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,360
Oh, God.

392
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,820
Oh, there's the PPC.

393
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,780
Oh, there you go.

394
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:23,620
Okay, there.

395
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:24,760
There it is.

396
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:51,220
cool you uh that's a kind of clever super villain there you can call me toxic okay there it is so many levels for you yeah no that's the point that's that that's nice trout's augments are pretty good when normie oh yeah no yeah no no we would not be safe on youtube yeah no if i had yeah no we would have not been safe

397
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,600
It's just...

398
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,520
I just...

399
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,120
Oh, shit.

400
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,620
Okay, wait, I got help.

401
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,260
I got to help him out, bro.

402
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,780
Thank God we're just...

403
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,460
That's right.

404
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,880
Why don't I just rip it off?

405
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,640
I mean, it's just swinging there.

406
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:16,860
It's just...

407
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:17,820
Yeah, why don't I...

408
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,300
Why don't I just rip it off?

409
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:20,900
Fuck.

410
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:24,940
Don't let it...

411
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,160
Hit you.

412
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,080
Oh my god, you're right, I could- Oh shit, whoops!

413
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:35,780
You're right, I could have just like swung it around too.

414
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:40,140
That's against the man coat.

415
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:43,120
Just start using it as a rope.

416
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:44,640
Figures.

417
00:39:56,850 --> 00:39:57,900
All right.

418
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:58,420
Bam!

419
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,800
Piece of shit.

420
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:07,800
Oh man, this fight scene is pretty good though.

421
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,460
Wait, it's just Jello.

422
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:14,200
Or do they, do all of them just let it swing around like that?

423
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:22,190
Oh, this way.

424
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,220
Black sensor clock.

425
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,200
Oh shit!

426
00:40:33,480 --> 00:41:07,770

427
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:12,190
Oh, shit.

428
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,280
Wait, what am I doing?

429
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,120
I'm rebooting?

430
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,780
I'm alt F4ing?

431
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,900
Alt F4 and reboot.

432
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,800
Oh, this is looking bad.

433
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:36,700
Jakarta, thank you for the super chat.

434
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:37,560
Thank you, thank you.

435
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,400
Oh, you're very...

436
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,140
Oh, I'm a barrier?

437
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:42,460
Nice.

438
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,940
Wait, would I have died if I didn't?

439
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:46,700
didn't do that.

440
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,720
I'm overclocking.

441
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:53,760
Don't worry.

442
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:57,720
Shroud!

443
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,840
He came back from Arc Raiders!

444
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:05,620
Hey, Shroud!

445
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:06,600
Welcome back!

446
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:13,580
So, what do you got left on them shields?

447
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,440
I said 40% He stopped his stream.

448
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:17,860
He says you're down to 28.

449
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,740
And he is not wrong about these things.

450
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,360
Good news, buddy.

451
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:31,040
Trout says he just wants the Astral Pulse, which we all know isn't really yours anyway.

452
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,620
Unless he missed the opportunity to not get Trout and voice Trout.

453
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,080
Oh, there he is.

454
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:40,940
Your dad killer.

455
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,320
System check.

456
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:47,800
Calculate the damage per second hitting shields.

457
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:52,080
Then tell me how many seconds I need to divert Astral pulse energy to Raka boosters.

458
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:54,400
Animation's really good.

459
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:55,320
Also, sound guy.

460
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,140
I hope all the sound is good so far.

461
00:42:59,840 --> 00:42:59,960
What?

462
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,720
Pulse power to the boosters.

463
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:03,140
It won't work.

464
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,160
This is a limited time offer, dude.

465
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,000
What's up?

466
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:08,060
Ignore him.

467
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:09,440
Villains always lie.

468
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:10,800
Oh, shit.

469
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:11,280
No.

470
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,580
I don't give a fuck, okay?

471
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,300
I'm just the messenger here.

472
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:18,060
He says you're not calculating that shift stuck to your legs, dumbass.

473
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,380
I wanted to hear more of the Dala.

474
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,100
See, everything's fine.

475
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,980
See, I told you he was lying.

476
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,940
Okay, but why censor the ass?

477
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,140
This ass is fine.

478
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:54,900
As is technically PG.

479
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:01,780
Oh,

480
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:06,840
oh, do I have a tracker?

481
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,680
Or like, oh.

482
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:16,700
He don't get to have cake and eat it too.

483
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,100
Stop fear!

484
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:58,500
that's fine he's the main character dispatch bye that mechaman situation was crazy though oh hey are we watching tick-tock now it was just over four months ago images like this were recorded across the Southland videos flooded social media and our newsroom showing what many thought to be oh the death of

485
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,420
Oh, like, that's his dad.

486
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,620
A Mecha Man has protected Los Angeles.

487
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:09,840
Built by an ordinary civilian with no superpowers.

488
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:14,520
This first suit was dubbed by some fans as Mecha Man Prime.

489
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:15,220
That's his dad.

490
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:16,800
Three generations of pilot.

491
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:17,860
Oh, that's his grandpa.

492
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:18,380
Their identities have secret.

493
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:22,820
Have given everything to protect this community, including their lives.

494
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:30,660
After the tragic passing of Prime, the next Mecha Man, known as Astral, teamed up with a star-studded superhero group.

495
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:32,900
known as the Brave Brigade.

496
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:37,080
Leading to an unprecedented period of peace in the Southland position.

497
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:40,020
After years of loyal service, tragedy struck again.

498
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:46,820
When Shroud, a former Brave Brigade member turned villain, killed the pilot of Mecha Man in cold blood.

499
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:52,140
But yet again, as hope was lost, a third generation of Mecha Man emerged.

500
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:54,780
A Mecha Man for the modern era.

501
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,980
A bulwark against organized crime in the greater Los Angeles area.

502
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:06,100
earlier today don't worry did he continue his bloodline

503
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:36,120
oh he's fine he didn't die he's literally right here about my health and the state of the mecha man suit just build another suit speculation to rest the suit has been damaged beyond my ability to repair so i will be stepping back from super just build another suit what do you mean does this mean you're finished can you repair Yeah!

504
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:38,420
How badly were you hurt?

505
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:39,680
One at a time, please.

506
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:44,840
Ashley Reines, San Pedro Daly, do you have anything to say to your fans?

507
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:49,240
The public outpouring, the vigils, a lot of them were worried you would wake up.

508
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,040
I did my best.

509
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,220
I suppose I want them to know I did my best.

510
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:56,880
I worked as long as I could, as hard as I could.

511
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:58,480
Oh, he's so fucking depressed.

512
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,340
That's all anyone can do.

513
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:00,540
Next question.

514
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:03,060
Chris Stratton, Torrance Tribune.

515
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:05,700
Does this mean you're retiring as Mecha Man?

516
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:10,400
Word on the street is you're done so you 100 years old.

517
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,520
Why are you talking like that?

518
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:13,140
Answer the question buddy boy.

519
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:14,400
Are you retiring?

520
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:17,720
My readers need the skinny and I aim to deliver.

521
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:19,140
No comment.

522
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:21,740
I'm not looking to comment on that just yet.

523
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,520
That's the only skinny I can give you.

524
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:25,280
No comment.

525
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,440
You deserve my comment after that.

526
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,720
You saw me no comment.

527
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:30,500
Just one more.

528
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:31,920
Preferably someone.

529
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,120
No headline for you.

530
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,600
Charles Kingsley, South Bay Signal.

531
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:47,420
So, Shroud kills your father, goes to jail 50 years, breaks out, and immediately dupes you into a trap where he destroys the Mega Man suit and puts you in a coma for months.

532
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,380
I can't get over the fact that his name is Shroud.

533
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:50,560
It's like, Shroud, didn't it?

534
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,500
Holy fuck, Shroud?

535
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,520
First, Shroud did what?

536
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:55,820
Why didn't Shroud kill you?

537
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,180
You haven't been conscious for months.

538
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:00,600
It'd be easy money taking you out.

539
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:03,080
Okay, Shroud wanted the Astral Pulse.

540
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,640
Bro, Shroud got real toxic.

541
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:24,980
I'm not sure I mattered much right you're unimportant which leads me to my next question Most heroes avenge their family you did the opposite you killed their legacy what how disappointed would your dad be if he were here right now I'm still alive.

542
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,220
I could go back.

543
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:27,800
I'll attack.

544
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:32,040
Fuck you You know what?

545
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:33,260
Who cares?

546
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,440
I'm retired anyway

547
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,900
My reputation is...

548
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:41,540
Oh, yeah!

549
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:42,640
Yeah!

550
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,680
On international news, dude?

551
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:48,580
Of course.

552
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,020
But there's two issues there.

553
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:54,720
He clearly has nothing left to lose.

554
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,020
I'm technically retired.

555
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:00,940
Yay, alcoholism, dude.

556
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:02,100
No one was stepping in.

557
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:03,840
Yes, I was...

558
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,360
Bro, I wouldn't fucking have.

559
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:13,360
Like I said, I have nothing to lose here.

560
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:18,980
That's...

561
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:20,040
Hey, I was watching that.

562
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:22,760
Bro, I'm broke.

563
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:23,500
I have no TV.

564
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:24,700
Are you assholes?

565
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,160
I was fucking watching that.

566
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:29,680
Hey, who are you calling assholes, asshole?

567
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:30,960
I'll handle this idiot.

568
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:31,860
Keep loading.

569
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:33,300
We're out of here in 30.

570
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:34,820
And who the fuck are you?

571
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:38,360
Yeah, you go go fucking hoax.

572
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:38,920
Ranger.

573
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,120
Someone with nothing to lose.

574
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:42,380
I beat up a reporter.

575
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:44,140
I can beat you up too.

576
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,320
Which is probably bad news for you.

577
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,100
Well, with nothing you have, you're about to lose again.

578
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,560
Whatever the case, I'm enough to deal with.

579
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,040
I'm a whole boat Ranger.

580
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:57,180
God damn it.

581
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:59,180
Look, you're hurt.

582
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:00,880
You're not thinking straight.

583
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:01,540
Wait, which one?

584
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:02,100
Okay, right.

585
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:04,540
Someone who knows which hand every punch is coming from.

586
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:05,620
I'm a punch with my right.

587
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:06,160
That's right.

588
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:06,920
Oh, shit.

589
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,840
That's right, I still have legs, though.

590
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:20,560
Oh, shit!

591
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,560
I can't continue my legacy.

592
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:27,960
Oh.

593
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:28,880
What the?

594
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:33,380
The fight back.

595
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:36,500
Eh.

596
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:38,360

599
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:14,220
Oh, God.

600
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:14,880

00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:30,220
Have you done this before?

610
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:31,780
Okay, but have you done this before?

611
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:32,620
Because maybe...

612
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:33,620
Oh, God.

613
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:35,800
Oh, gay.

614
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:37,100

Thank you.

618
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,080
One of them is on that roof.

Yeah, Mega Man, Mega Man.

620
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:51,780
You look like you can only romance two people, and they're both women.

621
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:52,800
What makes you say that?

622
00:51:57,350 --> 00:51:59,690
I could just romance all of them, you know?

623
00:51:59,930 --> 00:52:00,930
I have nothing to lose.

624
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:03,450
I should be able to romance any character.

625
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:06,110
It's lame.

626
00:52:08,290 --> 00:52:10,590

Chug, chug, chug.

00:52:46,550 --> 00:52:47,550
Love is in the air.

631
00:52:47,850 --> 00:52:49,350
Don't worry about keeping up.

632
00:52:49,770 --> 00:52:50,830
Something to do with the powers.

633
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:52,590
Yeah, I should be the romance shroud.

634
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:53,950
My daddy killer.

635
00:52:54,750 --> 00:52:55,810
What is that sentence?

636
00:52:58,230 --> 00:53:03,710
Hey, you should give yourself more credit to do what you did for as long as you did.

637
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:05,530
Especially without superpowers.

638
00:53:06,110 --> 00:53:06,610
Not true.

639
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:07,970
What do you call this?

640
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:09,630
Oh, God.

641
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:11,070

Yeah, to Toxic Yowie.

646
00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:18,170
Enemies to lovers, exactly.

647
00:53:18,790 --> 00:53:22,550
So, this game would have been perfect if I could romance everyone.

648
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:24,270
Millions?

649
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:25,170
Millions?

650
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:27,010
So you'll understand when the check comes.

651
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:28,050
You're serious.

652
00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:29,790
Millions?

653
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:33,890
Yeah, I basically burned through my entire inheritance, keeping it going.

654
00:53:34,470 --> 00:53:38,510
The last couple years have just been duct tape and sheer determination.

655
00:53:40,210 --> 00:53:41,590
What, like, what is this job?

656
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:42,250
Why did you do it?

657
00:53:42,650 --> 00:53:43,790
What did he say to you?

658
00:53:44,270 --> 00:53:47,650
Sacrifice everything to be a superhero to the point of financial...

659
00:53:47,650 --> 00:53:49,730
Oh my god, it's like Batman if he's broke.

660
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:53,030
Or like Iron Man if he had no money.

661
00:53:54,290 --> 00:53:56,590
It's like I've beenced.

662
00:53:57,850 --> 00:53:59,710
The only thing I'm good at is what I stream.

663
00:54:00,790 --> 00:54:02,930
Now that's a sad sentence.

664
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:05,530
Come on, that can't be true.

665
00:54:06,950 --> 00:54:07,930
I guess it could be true.

666
00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:10,970
So are you...

667
00:54:10,970 --> 00:54:11,810
He's broke, man.

668
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:35,530
Yeah, yeah, I should probably be switching to water Good, because I was hoping after some drinks to loosen you up I could learn a little more about you And if all that went well This is why he didn't invest Guys, he fucked up You always have like passive income I'm just trying to figure out if this is a fit or not You know,

669
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:43,750
then it's just a matter of picking the right moment A bar Well, propositions late at night in a bar can go Any number of ways.

670
00:54:45,770 --> 00:54:46,570
That's actually...

671
00:54:46,570 --> 00:54:47,250
What's that?

672
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:50,070
Oh, this is like pure alcohol.

673
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:51,530
It's not like alcohol.

674
00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:52,710
It is alcohol.

675
00:54:53,270 --> 00:54:55,730
I know because you spit it directly in the water.

676
00:54:55,950 --> 00:54:56,970
Damn, that's so hot, guys.

677
00:54:57,010 --> 00:54:57,450
That's water.

678
00:54:58,230 --> 00:54:59,530
That, see, how it is.

679
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:00,550
Guys, I have such good risk.

680
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:02,350
You drink hard liquor from a pint glass?

681
00:55:02,730 --> 00:55:07,390
Actually, I usually just drink it straight from the bottle, but I thought that would be embarrassing.

682
00:55:10,870 --> 00:55:12,110
I'm going to go clean up.

683
00:55:12,650 --> 00:55:13,290
Guys, see?

684
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:14,310
She likes this.

685
00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:15,650
She likes it.

686
00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:19,290
She likes when I'm lesser than her.

687
00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:22,530
When I'm more pathetic, guys.

688
00:55:25,090 --> 00:55:27,330
Hey, I'm talking to you, bitch.

689
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:30,270
Yeah, she's into it.

690
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:32,170
The more pathetic I am, the more...

691
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:35,290
I'm more attracted to her.

692
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:37,510
Don't you watch the news?

693
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:39,190
This is a superhero bar.

694
00:55:39,630 --> 00:55:40,450
Oh, wow.

695
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:41,650

You have a criminal record.

I am anymore.

703
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:57,710
So, you need to get the fuck out of here.

704
00:56:57,870 --> 00:56:58,390
Water.

705
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:01,370
We can do this the easy way.

706
00:57:02,790 --> 00:57:03,970
There we go.

707
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:06,510
There, easy way.

708
00:57:06,930 --> 00:57:08,910
No, right?

709
00:57:09,770 --> 00:57:11,570
I've been waiting alone.

710
00:57:12,650 --> 00:57:13,850
I'm not that stupid.

711
00:57:14,870 --> 00:57:19,070
Guys, guys, I know what the fuck alcohol does to fire.

712
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:21,690
Holy shite.

713
00:57:22,870 --> 00:57:23,590
Yeah, no wonder.

714
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:25,590
Then you gotta change your job, bro.

715
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:29,210
What song is that?

716
00:57:29,990 --> 00:57:31,230
Bro, I wanted to live.

717
00:57:31,470 --> 00:57:32,970
Your mouth, it's whistling.

718
00:57:33,470 --> 00:57:34,830
Come on, we should get you to a hospital.

719
00:57:35,210 --> 00:57:35,950
No, Koop.

720
00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:37,710
Fucking guy needs a dentist.

721
00:57:38,070 --> 00:57:38,910
Oh, hey, there's Jack.

722
00:57:39,270 --> 00:57:39,730
Sorry, shy.

723
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:41,290
Should be able to reattach it.

724
00:57:41,910 --> 00:57:42,470
Punch up.

728
00:59:23,870 --> 00:59:24,110
Yay!

729
00:59:26,250 --> 00:59:28,650
Yeah, she's the muscle, mommy.

730
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:53,880
This is like LA propaganda.

731
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:55,280
To sit on it.

732
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:56,760
Oh, yeah.

733
00:59:57,220 --> 00:59:57,900
That would have been cool.

734
00:59:59,540 --> 00:59:59,740
Oh, no.

735
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:00,020
Yeah.

736
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:00,660
Phenomenal.

737
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:02,360
Because you can see it.

738
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:05,380
And it looks like there's a couple up there already.

739
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:06,760
I really needed this.

740
01:00:08,840 --> 01:01:14,950
this has been pretty overwhelming you know yeah where's the traffic often and i think i really needed this so thank you for bringing me out i had a really great time don't you worry about it robert robertson how do you know my name that's his name robert robertson okay i'll tell you but you ended up with yeah yeah three times it happened three times grandpa bobby then my dad who i called dad but everyone else called robbie and then me robert robert robertson i wanted to be taken seriously family tradition robbie is the third they did it three times he died in the suit before i was born dad was killed fighting shroud that's when i There was a little inheritance and the life insurance money.

741
01:01:17,470 --> 01:01:17,990
I'm so sorry.

742
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:18,710
That's smart.

743
01:01:18,910 --> 01:01:20,970
I think as a superhero, you should always take life insurance.

744
01:01:21,270 --> 01:01:24,310
Just your run-of-the-mill sad superhero origin story.

745
01:01:25,230 --> 01:01:32,530
The family tradition, if there is one, is dying in that suit, which I guess I don't have to worry about anymore.

746
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:36,990
What is it?

747
01:01:37,230 --> 01:01:40,790
I'm not quite drunk enough to share my origin story just yet.

748
01:01:41,270 --> 01:01:53,750
but remember she never said how she knew definitely she'd like doxed him how did she know bro doxing is not a joking matter

753
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:31,260

758
01:03:55,780 --> 01:04:19,380
superheroes do that it's a big investment it'll take considerable time and money to get the suit repaired and the missing pieces replaced plenty of time to learn how to dispatch nine to five job let's go oh my god dispatch i know jobs your work common mistake she is just nice thank you champion thank you for Thank you.

What's going on?

767
01:04:53,020 --> 01:04:55,120
It was supposed to open up when I threw it to you.

768
01:04:55,420 --> 01:04:56,580
Oh, there it is.

769
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:57,320
Pop it on.

770
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:59,100
This is part of the assessment.

771
01:04:59,620 --> 01:05:00,400
I just leave.

772
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:02,940
I just reject the job.

773
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:05,500
Title game over.

774
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:08,660
Greetings and welcome to this training simulation.

775
01:05:09,220 --> 01:05:16,120
We may be superheroes, but we're nothing without SDN's real hero, the dispatcher.

776
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:18,880
So dispatcher, where do we start?

777
01:05:19,820 --> 01:05:21,180
What if I...

778
01:05:21,180 --> 01:05:22,200
Wait, what if I fail?

779
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:23,360
Does the game just end?

780
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:27,580
Well, it appears we've got our first call from a subscriber.

781
01:05:29,780 --> 01:05:33,520
I saw some scary, suspicious men last night leaving the old movie theater.

782
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:41,100
You'll receive requirements to help you determine which heroes to send yourself against the strength of the devil's fortified.

783
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:42,160
Okay.

784
01:05:42,540 --> 01:05:45,700
Such an array of brave heroes to choose from.

785
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:48,860
How could you possibly pick just one?

786
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:50,920
What the fuck is brain though?

787
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:55,160
This graph will show you what a hero does well and not so much.

788
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:55,520
Charisma.

789
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:04,220
Okay, charisma, combat, intelligent, vigor, mobility, charisma.

790
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:04,580
Okay.

791
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:08,880
A hero with a knack for vigor and combat looks right for the job.

792
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:12,220
That sounds like me.

793
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:13,160
Phenomoman.

794
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:14,840
Phenomoman, alright.

795
01:06:14,860 --> 01:06:23,440
Now that at least one hero is being dispatched, it's time to get to work all right a sound approach

796
01:06:28,430 --> 01:06:31,150
i will now return to sdn

797
01:06:36,270 --> 01:07:25,890
when a hero returns to sdn they'll need some much needed rn that stands for rest and relaxation oh it is thor's voice actor we could never escape margaritas everywhere i go don't forget to review your hero's performance it always comes again until you do all right this is my nine to five job now okay how did they do state of the art graph we can see an analysis of what skills the call required okay let's see how well i did after responding to that caller's well call there's no such thing as a perfect fit use your intellect and your roster to your advantage.

798
01:07:26,390 --> 01:07:30,110
Okay, so I just need to make sure I get the best fit possible.

799
01:07:30,450 --> 01:07:35,630
The more that my skills align with the needs of the job, the more likely I am to succeed.

800
01:07:35,730 --> 01:07:36,070
Okay.

801
01:07:38,110 --> 01:07:40,750
That seems easy enough.

802
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:41,970
Right?

803
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:49,210
Organized criminals, often led by figurehead supervillains, are the scourge of Southern California.

804
01:07:49,830 --> 01:07:52,730
We work tirelessly to root them out.

Incorporate your unique perspective.

809
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:07,340
A better city, brick by brick.

810
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:08,960
Okay, it has to be charisma, man.

811
01:09:09,820 --> 01:09:11,120
Who has... Oh, nope.

01:09:11,620 --> 01:09:12,700

The sweet talker.

815
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:16,880
Yeah, it has to be the sweet talker.

816
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:17,720
Yeah.

817
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:18,880
I mean, I could get two.

818
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:20,400
Doesn't really matter, right?

819
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:21,360
There you go.

820
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:23,540
Let's grab two.

821
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:24,940
Two for one.

822
01:09:28,660 --> 01:09:30,480
One of your heroes needs you.

823
01:09:30,740 --> 01:09:34,140
As their leader, your heroes will look to you.

824
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:36,900
Make choices and follow where they lead.

825
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:37,220
It's boring.

826
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:39,180
We're going to have to improvise.

827
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:40,260
Sprinkle.

828
01:09:40,460 --> 01:09:41,700
Oh, show off your moves.

829
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:43,000
That's what kids like to see.

830
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:44,580
That's right.

831
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:50,280
I assume.

832
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:52,460
These choices need the right skill.

833
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:56,460
Remember each of your hero's strengths and weaknesses.

834
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:01,580
A perfect dispatch.

835
01:10:02,260 --> 01:10:03,240
You are a natural.

836
01:10:03,540 --> 01:10:04,620
Imagine calling superhero.

837
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:06,160
I am.

838
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:08,220
I'm like the 9-1-1 Dispatcher.

839
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:09,220
Oh my god.

840
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:10,240
That's What's got that?

841
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:11,740
Oh my god.

842
01:10:11,820 --> 01:10:13,220
That's what's got this patch.

843
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:16,380
Karen, thank you for the Super Chat.

844
01:10:16,620 --> 01:10:16,700
Thank you.

845
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:17,200
Thank you.

846
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:19,100
And Doki And there's the phone.

847
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:20,180
Oh my God.

848
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:22,460
It's like we called 9-1-1 and you get me.

849
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:24,420
How fucked are you?

850
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:28,180
The convoy of Diablo's goons are harrying the highway patrol.

851
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:29,020
Intercept overwhelm.

852
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:32,340
As if traffic in this city was not bad enough.

853
01:10:32,820 --> 01:10:33,380
Who is?

854
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:35,120
Speaking of traffic and going places.

855
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:36,180
Okay.

856
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:39,280
Does SDN offer paid time off to take vacations?

857
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:40,740
Of course.

858
01:10:41,180 --> 01:10:43,880
PTO accrues at a regular rate over time.

859
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:45,780
Wait, there's paid vacation too?

860
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:48,980
As long as you discuss your schedule with your manager well in advance.

861
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:50,940
What the fuck is a PTO?

862
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:52,620
Yeah, what the fuck is a PTO?

863
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:53,960
Okay, okay, okay.

864
01:10:54,020 --> 01:10:55,660
There's a giant monster attacking.

865
01:10:55,820 --> 01:10:56,680
Oh, shit.

866
01:10:57,060 --> 01:10:58,300
Oh, shit.

867
01:10:58,820 --> 01:10:59,940
Oh, shit.

868
01:11:00,580 --> 01:11:01,440
Um, don't worry.

869
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:02,260
They'll be fine.

870
01:11:03,620 --> 01:11:05,380
I got time.

871
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:09,660
No, I don't think sending the, okay, um, all right, there you go.

872
01:11:09,980 --> 01:11:13,600
The diabolical supervillain El Diablo is attacking Los Angeles General.

873
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:14,640
Oh, shit.

874
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:17,180
It's one of my arch nemesis's.

875
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:24,260
Oh, he must have been using the convoy ambush as a distraction.

876
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:26,780
Okay, by the time, I can send one each.

877
01:11:27,220 --> 01:11:29,060
Oh, shit, no, he's a, oh, no.

878
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:34,620
Speaking of hospitals, did you know SDN offers a robust benefits package?

879
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:38,440
You want to get gentle too?

880
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:40,340
Alright, don't worry.

881
01:11:40,420 --> 01:11:41,340
We can wait a little bit.

882
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:41,980
We'll put what...

883
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:42,620
Oh my god.

884
01:11:43,180 --> 01:11:46,040
I need help getting to my doctor's appointment.

885
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:47,180
Make case before she...

886
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:48,360
Oh wait, that's mobility.

887
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:49,340
Alright.

888
01:11:49,460 --> 01:11:50,100
Clock this.

889
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:51,400
Don't worry.

890
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:52,580
Help this grandma.

891
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:54,080

01:11:54,620 --> 01:11:55,100
There we go.

893
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:57,200
El Diablo, you go in there.

894
01:11:58,720 --> 01:11:59,500
Alright, defend.

895
01:11:59,740 --> 01:12:00,420

Send help, please.

01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:19,040
The villains, convince the goons.

907
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:20,680
Okay, sweet talker.

908
01:12:21,020 --> 01:12:21,620

There you go.

919
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:31,840
There you go.

920
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:33,380
We are, we're so fine.

921
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:34,260
We're so fine.

922
01:12:34,340 --> 01:12:35,140
They're returning.

923
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:45,220

Oh my god Sometimes a hero can use their talents to tip the scales rough up and round the moons superheroes after all Okay, there you go

931
01:13:08,670 --> 01:13:09,750
Did we do it?

932
01:13:11,390 --> 01:13:13,270
We saved the children!

933
01:13:14,050 --> 01:13:17,030
The children are safe and sound.

934
01:13:20,550 --> 01:13:21,130
Okay, that's fine.

935
01:13:22,350 --> 01:13:23,010
Did we do it?

936
01:13:24,830 --> 01:13:26,670
I forgot the check marks, guys.

937
01:13:26,990 --> 01:13:28,010
Yay, we did it!

938
01:13:28,130 --> 01:13:29,190
You crossed the road!

01:13:29,730 --> 01:13:30,670
Okay, it's okay.

940
01:13:31,190 --> 01:13:32,410
Big and small.

941
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:36,570
We never ignore the people of the city, particularly the elderly.

942
01:13:36,990 --> 01:13:38,950
Speaking of retirement, quick question.

943
01:13:39,290 --> 01:13:44,310
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, no, yes, but there are limitations.

944
01:13:44,350 --> 01:13:46,850
How did you, you got the messages, Kim?

01:13:47,490 --> 01:13:49,570
What's the point of your job?

946

It's okay.

947
01:13:52,190 --> 01:13:53,270
Everything is fine.

948
01:13:54,330 --> 01:13:55,450
We'll just fire him.

949
01:13:56,010 --> 01:13:57,550
Guys, we'll fire him.

950
01:13:59,290 --> 01:14:01,370

El Diablo's goons are running scared.

We're right on the heels of his sidekick, El Diablo.

959
01:14:19,310 --> 01:14:21,210
How is this my fault?

960
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:26,610
His whole name is Sweet Talker, and somehow he didn't Sweet Talk his way out of it.

961
01:14:27,030 --> 01:14:30,330
Okay, back, survive the defeat and detain.

Okay, we can wait a little bit.

Oh, God.

968
01:15:18,050 --> 01:15:19,010
Oh, it's 100%.

Okay.

Nice.

972
01:15:21,470 --> 01:15:21,970
See?

973
01:15:22,250 --> 01:15:24,790
This should be 100% at that point.

974
01:15:26,650 --> 01:15:27,550
Oh, my God.

975
01:15:27,870 --> 01:15:28,390
Okay.

978
01:15:31,870 --> 01:15:32,110
Okay.

979
01:15:33,230 --> 01:15:34,370
What can I say?

980
01:15:34,650 --> 01:15:35,710
A lot, actually.

981
01:15:36,790 --> 01:15:37,410
Look, see?

982
01:15:37,510 --> 01:15:38,230
He did it.

983
01:15:38,350 --> 01:15:39,830

What am I?

991
01:16:19,590 --> 01:16:20,990
Some kind of emergency dispatch?

992
01:16:21,350 --> 01:16:22,530

Thank you, babe.

994
01:16:23,970 --> 01:16:25,230
It makes sense, yeah.

01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:33,100
Meet me at the SDN offices tomorrow.

996
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:34,360
That's a date.

997
01:16:34,540 --> 01:16:35,720
I'm not done saving you yet.

998
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:38,420
Bro, she can fix me.

999
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:46,000
See, guys, the more pathetic I am, the more she's into me.

1000
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:47,980
She can fix me.

1001
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:50,780
Every 10 seconds, someone dies.

1002
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:53,160
Ira Toki, hold my beer.

1003
01:16:53,940 --> 01:16:54,480
Cameron, thank you.

01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:55,420
Super chat, thank you.

1005
01:16:55,580 --> 01:16:55,980
Thank you.

1006
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:59,080
Oh my god, he's a fat-ass dog.

1007
01:17:09,970 --> 01:17:10,730
Give him some cereal.

1008
01:17:10,870 --> 01:17:11,670
I'm gonna make him fatter.

1009
01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:17,390
That's right.

1010
01:17:18,430 --> 01:17:20,310
The folks at SDN are the best in the business.

1011
01:17:20,730 --> 01:17:24,850
I met a nice lady.

1012
01:17:25,070 --> 01:17:26,650
The folks who live here have to deal with a lot.

1013
01:17:29,510 --> 01:17:31,230
Bro, I live like this.

1014
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:32,430
Bro, you live like...

1015
01:17:32,430 --> 01:17:33,590
Bro, I didn't unpack...

1016
01:17:33,590 --> 01:17:34,910
Oh, my God, he is me.

1017
01:17:36,190 --> 01:17:38,030
This is how he wins.

1018
01:17:42,350 --> 01:17:43,350
This is my house.

1019
01:17:43,730 --> 01:17:44,610
This is my apartment.

1020
01:17:47,030 --> 01:17:48,250
I'm so immersed.

1021
01:17:48,490 --> 01:17:49,530
I feel just like him.

1022
01:17:55,730 --> 01:17:58,390
Is there any after-credit scene, or do I just continue?

1023
01:17:59,410 --> 01:18:00,870
You live like that?

1024
01:18:01,410 --> 01:18:03,470
I wish my apartment was that clean.

1025
01:18:05,590 --> 01:18:07,630
No, this episode one, it's episodic.

1026
01:18:07,830 --> 01:18:12,010
This is why I didn't play the game until all the episodes are released, because I hate episodic format.

1027
01:18:13,250 --> 01:18:15,550
I fucking hate the episodic format in general.

1028
01:18:16,350 --> 01:18:17,130
Oh yeah, there you go.

1029
01:18:17,270 --> 01:18:18,810
Yeah, okay, it's a 50-50.

1030
01:18:19,390 --> 01:18:20,390
Yeah, that's very telltale.

1031
01:18:23,490 --> 01:18:24,770
Very telltale-like.

1032
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:25,550
Doki-doki.

1033
01:18:26,190 --> 01:18:27,910
Yeah, Linky was a super chat.

1034
01:18:27,990 --> 01:18:28,950
Thank you, thank you.

1035
01:18:28,990 --> 01:18:30,030
Alright, next.

1036
01:18:31,190 --> 01:18:32,270
Do we all kiss?

1037
01:18:32,670 --> 01:18:33,350
You would... See, look at that!

1038
01:18:33,510 --> 01:18:34,350
I'm the majority!

1039
01:18:36,410 --> 01:18:37,670
We all saw it!

1040
01:18:38,490 --> 01:18:40,270
Let the goon drop your success rate.

1041
01:18:40,690 --> 01:18:43,130
You perform better than 60% of the players?

1042
01:18:43,290 --> 01:18:43,570
Nice.

1043
01:18:43,770 --> 01:18:45,290
Too fair, I was fucking around, though.

1044
01:18:48,630 --> 01:18:52,770
You and 21% of players attacked the reporter.

1045
01:18:53,430 --> 01:18:54,070
You... Okay.

1046
01:18:54,630 --> 01:18:55,010
Alright.

1047
01:18:55,530 --> 01:18:56,930
I aced it, guys.

1048
01:18:57,030 --> 01:18:57,450
Look at that.

1049
01:18:57,530 --> 01:19:00,710
You and 53% players ace the tutorial.

1050
01:19:01,230 --> 01:19:05,070
Bro, I'm, guys, look, I'm the 1%.

1051
01:19:05,070 --> 01:19:06,490
Jakarta, thank you for the super chat.

1052
01:19:06,590 --> 01:19:07,470
Thank you, thank you.

1053
01:19:08,770 --> 01:19:09,550
Look at that.

1054
01:19:09,670 --> 01:19:10,310
See, look at that.

1055
01:19:10,430 --> 01:19:10,810
I did it.

1056
01:19:10,950 --> 01:19:11,370
I aced it.

1057
01:19:11,650 --> 01:19:14,270
I let two people die and I'd still pass.

1058
01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:16,630
I got, I got an A plus.

1059
01:19:18,810 --> 01:19:20,750
Obviously those hostages don't matter.

1060
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:27,500
He was going to die anyway.

1061
01:19:28,420 --> 01:19:30,040
Not today, but maybe tomorrow.

1062
01:19:31,640 --> 01:20:06,060
Don't keep give into the mind control societal thank you super chat thank you thank you i heard there's a character in here that looks like the arcane girl i'm gonna be late for band practice unexpected things happen every day phenomena man we're literally living in a town where there's super villains someone's gonna have to die you can count on sdn to help lift the burdens life throws at us let sdn be your rock so you can rock SDN is not an insurance company and does not cover damages.

1063
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:11,560
She's definitely not making it to ban practice.

1064
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:15,480
Is SDN like a superhero union?

1065
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:17,020
Hmm?

1066
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:19,540
No, just the commercial.

1067
01:20:19,900 --> 01:20:20,320
It was weird.

1068
01:20:20,780 --> 01:20:21,180
Weird.

1069
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:22,700
Yeah, right.

1070
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:24,760
Oh, so it's like a union.

1071
01:20:24,940 --> 01:20:27,320
Oh my god, even superheroes have a union?

1072
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:31,260
It's a... I'm joking.

1073
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:33,180
Oh, it's like a corpo.

1074
01:20:33,180 --> 01:20:35,160
Oh, it's like an...

1075
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:35,260
Oh.

1076
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:38,280
I'm a Famama fan, you might say.

1077
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:39,180
Yeah, he's phenomenal.

1078
01:20:40,340 --> 01:20:41,200
He seems cool.

1079
01:20:41,980 --> 01:20:42,700
Phenomenal even.

1080
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:44,540
And quite the salesman.

1081
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:45,320
Oh, yeah.

1082
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:47,740
I mean, he could sell snowballs to an Eskimo.

1083
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:50,860
Is it not cool to say?

1084
01:20:51,340 --> 01:20:51,860
Snowman.

1085
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:54,180
He could sell snowballs to a snow...

1086
01:20:54,180 --> 01:20:55,060
Oh my God, I'm Corpo.

1087
01:20:55,420 --> 01:20:55,540
Carson.

1088
01:20:56,180 --> 01:20:57,500
Anyone made a snow?

1089
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:00,220
Any color snow doesn't have to be white.

1090
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:04,020
God.

1091
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:04,720
Yeah.

1092
01:21:04,740 --> 01:21:07,000
Oh, so it's like a private security firm.

1093
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:09,060
Oh, wait, that's fucked.

1094
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:11,580
If I have to, like, hire someone to save me.

1095
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:12,240
Yeah, just, yeah.

1096
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:13,160
Okay, let me.

1097
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:14,620
Wait, how do they get paid?

1098
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:16,480
Do, like, the civilians they save?

1099
01:21:17,060 --> 01:21:17,400
Pay them?

1100
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:20,540
I have so many questions.

1101
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:22,360
No, I mean, yes.

1102
01:21:22,660 --> 01:21:23,640
But yes is more.

1103
01:21:24,140 --> 01:21:25,840
My powers make everything wet.

1104
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:26,800
Wait, okay.

1105
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:29,040
Okay, I need a no.

1106
01:21:29,940 --> 01:21:33,340
Wait, they have to say it's a subscription phase.

1107
01:21:35,160 --> 01:22:32,500
guys if you subscribe every month it's like it's a monthly subscription guys if you guys don't want to fucking die make sure to monthly subscribe to the superhero perk that is fuck wait that is I was clearly not paying too much no I'm so confused I was like subscribers like I was like what do you mean subscribers so it's actually a private security firm dude is there any superheroes that do it's like a public defendant you know how like criminals they are they have the right for a lawyer are there superheroes that like you know do it for charity it's like public superheroes you know like you might have to wait like two to three this like five to ten business days oh that's what mecca no wonder i was broke how they call me but yes i am sure it was okay that makes sense now

1108
01:22:37,010 --> 01:22:38,170
Oh, there's Flambé.

1109
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:46,040
That's crazy.

1110
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:47,180
A subscription?

1111
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:53,060
Bro, it's like, you're like dangling off the bridge and you're like, sorry, you forgot to pay for your subscription fee.

1112
01:22:54,140 --> 01:22:55,240
You missed your payment.

1113
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:56,360
You're Mecca man.

1114
01:22:56,980 --> 01:22:59,380
I, you're dead, I thought.

1115
01:22:59,860 --> 01:23:00,740
Just on the inside.

1116
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:04,580
You look small or different in person.

1117
01:23:05,340 --> 01:23:06,480
Never me your heroes, kid.

1118
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,300
Oh, wasn't sure you'd show up.

1119
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:11,140
It's like health insurance.

1120
01:23:11,220 --> 01:23:12,360
with extra steps.

1121
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:14,200
Sorry, but I need him for something.

1122
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:15,200
Follow me.

1123
01:23:20,340 --> 01:23:25,460
In Doki's world, Batman would fund Wayne Tech by charging $5 a month in protection fee.

1124
01:23:25,860 --> 01:23:26,920
I actually gave it a super chat.

1125
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:27,940
Thank you, thank you.

1126
01:23:29,340 --> 01:23:31,160
Guys, that's why the hostage is sad.

1127
01:23:31,260 --> 01:23:32,260
What's happening right now?

1128
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:33,820
We don't want too many people knowing them.

1129
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:35,860
We missed the subscription payment.

1130
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:39,520
Heroes, but it's better if you keep your identity a secret.

1131
01:23:40,180 --> 01:23:41,500
We've had incidents in the past.

1132
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:42,120
Here.

1133
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:51,800

You think I want to tell people our dispatcher's a fucking loser?

1142
01:26:19,660 --> 01:26:22,800
If I make superpowers, doesn't automatically make you a superhero.

1143
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:23,500
That's right.

1144
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:25,860
If you're born with one, you have to earn the other.

1145
01:26:28,260 --> 01:26:29,080
Well, I'm wet.

1146
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:30,580
I see why you like him.

1147
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:32,120
Look at that trip.

1148
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:33,120
What does that look?

1149
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:34,140
Best by fight club?

1150
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:36,500
Bro, you have asthma.

1151
01:26:36,820 --> 01:26:41,480
That ain't fucking, uh, that ain't fucking tough, bro.

1152
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:42,980
It's not tough.

1153
01:26:43,060 --> 01:26:44,360
when you have asthma.

1154
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:46,240
And she's at the bottom.

1155
01:26:46,580 --> 01:26:49,320
She called herself Invisibitch when she was a villain.

1156
01:26:49,740 --> 01:26:50,520
Bro, she looked down.

1157
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:51,300
You saw that.

1158
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:54,480
Yeah, I thought Invisigal felt kind of corny for her.

1159
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:55,460
You saw her look down.

1160
01:26:56,220 --> 01:26:57,280
Her eyes flick down.

1161
01:26:57,500 --> 01:26:58,640
Just get your shirt on, Dadbot.

1162
01:27:00,660 --> 01:27:02,240
I have a six-pack.

1163
01:27:13,050 --> 01:27:14,990
It reminds me of the Incredibles.

1164
01:27:15,510 --> 01:27:17,750
But we've got what makes the real difference.

1165
01:27:18,190 --> 01:27:18,730
Great people.

1166
01:27:20,090 --> 01:27:21,470
Even people, and they're still great.

1167
01:27:23,590 --> 01:27:25,370
Oh my god, this is depressing.

1168
01:27:25,950 --> 01:27:28,330
Facts, scan does literally everything.

1169
01:27:28,510 --> 01:27:29,610
This is so depressing.

1170
01:27:30,010 --> 01:27:30,950
One of the 3Ds.

1171
01:27:31,150 --> 01:27:33,230
This is an actual nine to five officeware.

1172
01:27:38,490 --> 01:27:39,050
3Ds?

1173
01:27:39,170 --> 01:27:39,730
3Ds?

1174
01:27:40,730 --> 01:27:41,290
Dispatching.

1175
01:27:42,410 --> 01:27:42,970
Documentation.

1176
01:27:43,670 --> 01:27:44,970
Diversity is the third.

1177
01:27:45,590 --> 01:27:47,150
Not in terms of priority, of course.

1178
01:27:48,090 --> 01:27:48,110
Yep.

1179
01:27:48,550 --> 01:27:49,870
We're all about diversity.

1180
01:27:50,090 --> 01:27:58,070
Lana works in the mailroom from a different galaxy altogether and then there's Galen way back there born with superhearing.

1181
01:27:58,330 --> 01:28:04,130

Nice meeting you, Royd.

1186
01:29:52,970 --> 01:29:55,530
Even if it was while we were both holding our dates.

1187
01:29:56,570 --> 01:29:58,530
You one funny bugger.

1188
01:29:58,690 --> 01:29:59,650
Mecca man.

1189
01:29:59,910 --> 01:30:00,150
What?

1190
01:30:03,790 --> 01:30:04,790
How did you know?

1191
01:30:05,210 --> 01:30:05,610
What the fuck?

1192
01:30:05,690 --> 01:30:09,690
Okay, so I was worried about your unwashed hand, but now I'm worried that everyone here knows who I am.

1193
01:30:09,990 --> 01:30:10,470
Nah, brother.

1194
01:30:10,770 --> 01:30:11,370
It's Kapoo.

1195
01:30:11,770 --> 01:30:13,670
Need to know basis and Roy need to know.

1196
01:30:14,150 --> 01:30:16,450
I don't want to come pick up your soup or fix them for the SDN.

1197
01:30:16,610 --> 01:30:16,870
Cool.

1198
01:30:17,210 --> 01:30:18,550
You're going to wash before you do that?

1199
01:30:18,570 --> 01:30:21,150
Bro, why is everyone doxing me?

1200
01:30:21,150 --> 01:30:22,510
Just touch my pants with underwear only.

1201
01:30:23,090 --> 01:30:24,570
Even for shake, I just do like this.

1202
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:31,460
Can you show me again?

1203
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:34,040
I don't think I got it.

1204
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:36,300
Oh, you fixed our suit.

1205
01:30:39,140 --> 01:30:40,120
Holy shit.

1206
01:30:40,280 --> 01:30:41,760
Who's this freckled face, Fung?

1207
01:30:42,540 --> 01:30:43,160
How are you?

1208
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:45,520
That's an aggressive way to greet someone.

1209
01:30:46,100 --> 01:30:48,060
Look at this skinny latte prick.

1210
01:30:48,460 --> 01:30:49,460
Your bones, kid.

1211
01:30:49,940 --> 01:31:54,780

1213
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:23,580
Obviously I'd let Robert have one last.

1214
01:32:23,660 --> 01:32:27,360
I love you before I extinguish the light from his eyes.

1215
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:30,040
Was he always like this?

1216
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:31,600
Yes, actually.

1217
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:33,920
We joke, we laugh, we suppress our trauma.

1218
01:32:34,540 --> 01:32:35,700
Alright, enough of this feeling shit.

1219
01:32:36,020 --> 01:32:37,600
Let's introduce you to your team of losers.

1220
01:32:40,420 --> 01:32:41,740
Our team of losers?

1221
01:32:44,940 --> 01:32:49,040
Now if I'm being honest, I thought and still think we should have canned these tuners months ago.

1222
01:32:49,940 --> 01:33:40,020

1225
01:35:20,260 --> 01:35:20,860
They're shy.

1226
01:35:22,420 --> 01:35:22,640
Malabala.

1227
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:23,460
Oh.

1228
01:35:23,860 --> 01:35:25,720
I heard you can't romance her.

1229
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:26,620
So what's the point?

1230
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:28,040
Oh.

1231
01:35:30,260 --> 01:35:31,300
That's magic.

1232
01:35:31,980 --> 01:35:33,360
Wait, that's fucking magic.

1233
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:34,120
Oh my god.

1234
01:35:34,260 --> 01:35:35,720
We can't escape Marvel rivals.

1235
01:35:37,720 --> 01:35:39,200
Murder is still murder.

1236
01:35:39,780 --> 01:35:41,480
Yeah, you can't romance her apparently.

1237
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:45,920
Sonars and they sponsor atheist true crime.

1238
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:48,760
Assault, burglary, forgery, kid happy.

1239
01:35:49,580 --> 01:36:21,240

1240
01:36:21,300 --> 01:36:22,220
Oh, because she's taxed.

1241
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:23,380
She's actually super talented.

1242
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:26,440
Oh my god, wait.

1243
01:36:26,760 --> 01:36:29,680
Assault, drug possession, DUI, tax evasion.

1244
01:36:29,860 --> 01:36:35,740
I guess for how you can't be a super villain if your fucking super villain thing is tax evasion.

1245
01:36:36,460 --> 01:36:39,640
Music snap, highlight consistently requests a return to her trailer.

1246
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:41,000
Holographic.

1247
01:36:41,160 --> 01:36:42,620
How is she the super villain?

1248
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:45,160
If all she does was just evade taxes.

1249
01:36:45,320 --> 01:36:46,660
Like everyone does it.

1250
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:48,800
Not me, not me, not me.

1251
01:36:49,580 --> 01:36:50,500
It's true.

1252
01:36:53,940 --> 01:36:55,240
You're not me, though.

1253
01:36:56,520 --> 01:36:57,040
Not...

1254
01:36:57,040 --> 01:37:00,580
Papa Smirked you're all reformed just like you.

1255
01:37:00,760 --> 01:37:01,940
Thank you, but a super chat.

1256
01:37:02,220 --> 01:37:03,040
Thank you, thank you.

1257
01:37:03,700 --> 01:37:08,120
The Z team, my team, their in- Get a Doki, drugs are bad.

1258
01:37:08,280 --> 01:37:10,120
You're all not the true of dangerous fuck-ups.

1259
01:37:10,460 --> 01:37:11,560
We're not looking for miracles.

1260
01:37:12,740 --> 01:37:13,980
But we'd love one if we could get it.

1261
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:15,780
Can you show him his desk?

1262
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:16,680
Sure.

1263
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,320
It's not so super.

1264
01:37:19,580 --> 01:37:32,620
if you're if you only crime is like drugs and tax evasion how is that the super part it's just a regular the one percent pretty sparse but feel free to decorate

1265
01:37:37,480 --> 01:38:18,600

Sorry, my first shift.

1267
01:38:25,540 --> 01:38:29,930
Tell me that's not your real first day.

1268
01:38:30,510 --> 01:38:32,430
You can't be this sugar the other day.

1269
01:38:33,270 --> 01:38:33,710
Rafi.

1270
01:38:34,110 --> 01:38:35,810
Can we clear the channel, please?

1271
01:38:35,930 --> 01:38:37,450
There's a lot of overlapping on this.

1272
01:38:37,610 --> 01:38:39,650
Bro, I got the suicide squad.

1273
01:38:40,910 --> 01:38:44,830
I got the worst fucking villains for this shit.

1274
01:38:45,190 --> 01:38:46,030
He packing money.

1275
01:38:46,590 --> 01:38:46,710
Ah!

1276
01:38:47,690 --> 01:38:49,450
But he's got a lot of bruises.

1277
01:38:50,330 --> 01:38:50,790
Which I'm into.

1278
01:38:51,210 --> 01:38:52,870
Again, please clear the channel.

1279
01:38:53,010 --> 01:38:53,670
Clear comes.

1280
01:38:53,790 --> 01:38:54,210
Clear comes.

1281
01:38:54,230 --> 01:38:56,510
People are dying.

1282
01:38:57,030 --> 01:38:57,990
Clear comms.

1283
01:38:58,370 --> 01:39:01,010
These calls are fucking recorded for training fucking purposes.

1284
01:39:01,510 --> 01:39:08,090
So keep the fucking line clear before we send your stupid fucking asses back to whatever fucking cell we pulled your stupid fucking asses out of.

1285
01:39:08,850 --> 01:39:09,350
Damn.

1286
01:39:11,810 --> 01:39:12,450
Jeez.

1287
01:39:12,870 --> 01:39:14,950
My son's balloon is stuck in a tree.

1288
01:39:15,330 --> 01:39:16,310
Can you send someone?

1289
01:39:17,050 --> 01:39:22,210
Alright, climb a 40 feet tree to retrieve a don't make the child cry.

1290
01:39:23,030 --> 01:39:23,390
Okay.

1291
01:39:24,350 --> 01:39:26,470
Obviously, someone with charisma, right?

1292
01:39:26,830 --> 01:39:27,530
Oh, yes, sir.

1293
01:39:28,010 --> 01:39:29,350
Charisma, mobility.

1294
01:39:31,130 --> 01:39:32,030
Okay, you can climb.

1295
01:39:32,130 --> 01:39:34,950
No, okay, I would assume climbing is what I'm looking for.

1296
01:39:35,730 --> 01:39:38,190
I have, no, she's, she'll make someone cry.

1297
01:39:38,450 --> 01:39:38,930
Uh-huh.

It's okay.

1311
01:40:35,630 --> 01:40:38,030
You aren't a genius if you need a piece of paper that says you're a genius?

1312
01:40:38,390 --> 01:40:39,610
Very high profile.

1313
01:40:39,850 --> 01:40:41,130
Send someone that will make...

01:40:47,950 --> 01:40:48,990
She's a celebrity.

1320
01:40:50,130 --> 01:40:52,230
No, she's a celebrity, guys.

1321
01:40:54,630 --> 01:40:55,470
There's no way.

1322
01:40:55,530 --> 01:40:56,990
Why would I send Charlie?

1323
01:40:58,030 --> 01:40:58,410

1329
01:41:07,750 --> 01:41:08,230

01:41:09,910 --> 01:41:10,390
He is.

1333
01:41:10,550 --> 01:41:10,750
Okay.

1334
01:41:11,290 --> 01:41:12,470
Did I mention I went to Harvard?

1335
01:41:12,470 --> 01:41:14,810

Okay.

1343
01:41:29,910 --> 01:41:31,250

01:41:31,250 --> 01:41:32,210
Oh, my God, we did it.

1345
01:41:32,270 --> 01:41:33,310

01:45:04,230 --> 01:45:04,230
Avoid.

1400
01:45:04,470 --> 01:45:05,310

You guys got this.

1406
01:45:12,350 --> 01:45:13,490
You guys don't need charisma.

1407
01:45:13,690 --> 01:45:15,530
We just need to be invisible.

1408
01:45:16,990 --> 01:45:17,670
Do we need two?

1409
01:45:18,330 --> 01:45:19,970

Fire at a local park has gotten out of control.

1413
01:45:25,410 --> 01:45:26,910
Did you start that fire?

1414
01:45:27,150 --> 01:45:27,450

Um, maybe.

1421
01:46:10,330 --> 01:46:11,590

01:46:12,750 --> 01:46:13,550
Oh, shit.

1423
01:46:16,830 --> 01:46:16,830
Hack.

1424
01:46:16,950 --> 01:46:18,010
We're gonna hack the system.

1425
01:46:18,590 --> 01:46:19,630
I got you guys.

1426
01:46:20,130 --> 01:46:22,410
I got my PC, my wooden keyboard.

1427
01:46:22,530 --> 01:46:23,590
I can hack this.

1428
01:46:24,270 --> 01:46:26,610
As long as I'm not timed, I'm timed.

1429
01:46:30,470 --> 01:46:33,370
I had one criteria.

1430
01:46:41,030 --> 01:46:42,090
I'm timed.

1431
01:46:42,590 --> 01:46:43,490
Who would have thought?

1432
01:46:47,990 --> 01:46:48,310
Okay.

1433
01:46:52,010 --> 01:46:53,450
We're so done.

1434
01:46:55,950 --> 01:46:56,190
Oh.

1435
01:46:57,310 --> 01:46:59,830
Oh, if I mess up one, I didn't even realize that.

1436
01:47:00,450 --> 01:47:00,870
There you go.

1437
01:47:00,990 --> 01:47:01,770
We did it.

1438
01:47:02,910 --> 01:47:03,470
No pressure.

1439
01:47:03,570 --> 01:47:04,010
No pressure.

1440
01:47:04,030 --> 01:47:35,410
at all we found it too many soft skills hey a hero ranked up good oh did he what did he do every rank up earns skill oh using per increasing stats what do we want anyway uh let's have more you could be more more smart actually what do we want do we want charisma or mobility intelligent all right let's do it We'll make him smarter.

1441
01:47:38,170 --> 01:47:39,490
mad bat.

1442
01:47:39,950 --> 01:47:41,250
Only sonar level is up.

1443
01:47:41,250 --> 01:47:42,530
Everybody should step back.

1444
01:47:43,550 --> 01:47:45,970
We've encountered these thieves before.

1445
01:47:47,150 --> 01:47:51,310
Track down no members to find their hideout.

1446
01:47:51,690 --> 01:47:54,530
I feel like intelligent... I can wait a little bit.

1447
01:47:55,530 --> 01:47:56,150
I just need...

1448
01:47:56,150 --> 01:47:56,830
Okay, here we go.

1449
01:47:58,890 --> 01:47:59,630
Okay, here we go.

1450
01:47:59,850 --> 01:48:01,250
It's time to educate them.

1451
01:48:01,290 --> 01:48:03,430
He said I got arrested for tax evasion.

1452
01:48:04,030 --> 01:48:04,710
I wish.

1453
01:48:05,850 --> 01:48:06,250
Okay, what do...

1454
01:48:06,250 --> 01:48:08,410
Okay, we've counted these thieves before.

1455
01:48:09,330 --> 01:48:12,170
Compile and cross-reference past case.

1456
01:48:12,790 --> 01:48:13,870
Going now.

1457
01:48:14,050 --> 01:48:17,070
Track down members to find their hideout.

1458
01:48:17,970 --> 01:48:18,250
Maybe?

1459
01:48:19,090 --> 01:48:19,750
Yeah, okay.

1460
01:48:20,850 --> 01:48:23,010
Well, we have to track them down, wouldn't you?

1461
01:48:23,650 --> 01:48:24,650
Maybe these two?

1462
01:48:26,790 --> 01:48:27,910
Ag and...

1463
01:48:27,910 --> 01:48:28,810
Tata.

1464
01:48:29,010 --> 01:48:30,470
Ag and mobility.

1465
01:48:30,610 --> 01:48:34,010
I feel like you need intelligence, but none of them are smart in my career.

1466
01:48:35,030 --> 01:48:36,630
This is a little bit this bad.

1467
01:48:36,750 --> 01:48:38,730
I don't have any smart people in my crew.

1468
01:48:39,090 --> 01:48:46,430
All right, we can wait a little bit Disrupted use your body Just use your body.

1469
01:48:46,570 --> 01:48:47,250
You're made of clay.

1476
01:50:14,680 --> 01:50:15,260
Send Sonar.

1477
01:50:15,660 --> 01:50:17,000
Send literally anyone else.

1478
01:50:18,040 --> 01:50:18,340
Sure.

1479
01:50:20,180 --> 01:50:20,560
Send Sonar.

1480
01:50:20,740 --> 01:50:22,220
A high-ranking Vanderstanker.

1481
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:23,800
It would mean a lot.

1482
01:50:24,120 --> 01:50:25,460
Let Sonar meet his hero.

1483
01:50:25,820 --> 01:50:27,980
William and pitch him ideas.

1484
01:50:29,180 --> 01:50:31,160
The other option will disappear.

1485
01:50:32,220 --> 01:50:32,480
Alright.

1486
01:50:34,280 --> 01:50:35,540
Oh, I can wait.

01:50:41,140 --> 01:50:42,720
That little shit I want in behind bars.

1492
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,960
Track down and encourage him to turn his life around.

1493
01:50:46,400 --> 01:50:47,340
Gosh, okay.

1494
01:50:52,040 --> 01:50:54,060
Oh, we'll think about it.

1495
01:50:54,440 --> 01:50:55,040
All right, it's okay.

1496
01:50:55,160 --> 01:50:55,640
He's resting.

1497
01:50:56,960 --> 01:50:57,600
All right, there you go.

1498
01:51:00,040 --> 01:51:02,620
I don't know if you should meet his hero while he's a...

1499
01:51:02,620 --> 01:51:03,080
You know what?

1500
01:51:03,200 --> 01:51:03,640
Fuck it.

1501
01:51:03,720 --> 01:51:04,660
Never meet your heroes.

1502
01:51:05,160 --> 01:51:05,560
Go ahead.

1503
01:51:05,800 --> 01:51:08,160
You will not regret this.

1504
01:51:08,180 --> 01:51:10,060
Never meet your heroes.

1505
01:51:10,240 --> 01:51:12,960
I didn't think I would until you said that.

1506
01:51:13,040 --> 01:51:13,300
All right.

1507
01:51:13,940 --> 01:51:14,660
He's got to learn.

1508
01:51:15,340 --> 01:51:17,960
Guys, he's got to learn to never meet his heroes.

1509
01:51:19,400 --> 01:51:20,380
Jerry L.B.

1510

Self and use and will be key.

1514
01:51:30,460 --> 01:51:32,020
Okay, it's well guarded.

1515
01:51:32,900 --> 01:51:33,160

01:53:37,100 --> 01:53:37,520
Scaring children.

1541
01:53:38,100 --> 01:53:39,520
Obviously my favorite part of the job.

1542
01:53:39,680 --> 01:53:40,500

You're going to poke it with a stick?

1547
01:55:47,280 --> 01:55:47,720
Check his pulse.

1548
01:55:49,620 --> 01:55:50,300
Granny's alive.

1549
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:51,140
Thank Christ.

1550
01:55:51,740 --> 01:55:52,980
I don't want to have to lift this guy.

1551
01:55:53,580 --> 01:55:55,340
So, can I go now?

1552
01:55:55,500 --> 01:55:56,820
No, this isn't a wellness check.

1553
01:55:56,940 --> 01:55:57,580
It's a B&E.

1554
01:55:57,680 --> 01:55:59,160
Let's figure out if the PURP is still there.

1555
01:55:59,220 --> 01:55:59,520
PURP?

1556
01:55:59,800 --> 01:56:00,220
B&E?

1557
01:56:00,700 --> 01:56:01,400
Okay, Lieutenant.

1558
01:56:02,480 --> 01:56:04,420
Fuck, I can't think of a character from a cop show.

1559
01:56:04,620 --> 01:56:04,840
Cool.

1560
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:09,040
Well, why don't you stay put and work on that while I get another camera up online?

1561
01:56:09,780 --> 01:56:10,720
She's my least favorite.

1562
01:56:11,180 --> 01:56:22,900
the worst of the lot that surprises me you guys got similar energy how do i switch cameras don't put your ass to think it was protecting thank you we're getting tech advice from an old person bro i'm not even oh he's 39.

1563
01:56:23,080 --> 01:56:42,040
you're hearing bro from an old person dan lieutenant dan is that is that a thing yes i am the legless vietnam vet from forest gump sick burn access to nine what am i doing something wrong pushing that button just says access denied Damn it.

1564
01:56:42,240 --> 01:56:43,600
Sometimes people add extra security.

1565
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:46,080
They don't understand it just makes it harder for us to do our job.

1566
01:56:46,540 --> 01:56:47,020
Oh, God.

1567
01:56:47,140 --> 01:56:47,740
Am I hacking?

1568
01:56:49,400 --> 01:56:50,540
Bro, it's a donut shop.

1569
01:56:50,720 --> 01:56:53,500
What kind of security do you need in a donut shop?

1570
01:56:55,440 --> 01:56:58,740
Clearly not a really good donut shop if there's no one there.

1571
01:57:00,200 --> 01:57:02,460
Bro, there's no one even in this donut shop.

1572
01:57:02,740 --> 01:57:03,200
Oh, my God.

1573
01:57:03,220 --> 01:57:04,660
It's money laundering, isn't it?

1574
01:57:07,100 --> 01:57:07,880
Oh, God.

1575
01:57:08,180 --> 01:57:09,880
He's money laundering here, isn't he?

1576
01:57:12,260 --> 01:57:15,520
Why does a donut shop even need extra security?

1577
01:57:15,800 --> 01:57:15,800
Exactly!

1578
01:57:16,140 --> 01:57:17,480
That's what I'm saying!

1579
01:57:17,780 --> 01:57:19,580
There's nobody even eating here!

1580
01:57:21,700 --> 01:57:22,380
What?

1581
01:57:28,560 --> 01:57:30,420
What the fuck?

1582
01:57:30,500 --> 01:57:31,620
How do I do this?

1583
01:57:33,380 --> 01:57:34,280
That's odd.

1584
01:57:42,720 --> 01:57:43,860
Oh, the key?

1585
01:57:45,020 --> 01:57:45,540

You need to disappear.

1590
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:26,540
Why are you whispering, you idiot?

1591
01:58:26,980 --> 01:58:27,760
You're in my ear.

1592
01:58:33,260 --> 01:58:34,480
Is this shroud?

1593
01:58:39,630 --> 01:58:40,550
Oh, shit.

1594
01:58:41,730 --> 01:58:43,090
It's defense this now.

1595
01:58:43,250 --> 01:58:44,330
Oh, wait, he asked his other thing.

1596
01:58:44,470 --> 01:58:45,170
It's just a gusher.

1597
01:58:47,070 --> 01:58:47,990
Be careful.

1598
01:58:49,390 --> 01:58:50,430
Lieutenant Dan.

1599
01:58:50,870 --> 01:58:51,150
Never mind.

1600
01:58:54,150 --> 01:58:56,510
Me, that's like a name, but I'm cheating.

1601
01:58:57,830 --> 01:58:59,050
Got any more great advice?

01:58:59,730 --> 01:59:00,130

Go invisible!

1605
01:59:03,310 --> 01:59:03,690
Go invisible!

1606
01:59:05,270 --> 01:59:08,230
I was too busy I was watching to cut teeth.

1607
01:59:11,770 --> 01:59:12,130
Shit.

01:59:19,310 --> 01:59:21,630

Invisigo, just hold him off while he find a way to help.

1611
01:59:36,490 --> 01:59:37,130
Oh, am I hacking?

1612
01:59:38,030 --> 01:59:40,630
I can use the overhead sprinklers to short out his blaster.

1613
01:59:41,990 --> 01:59:43,010
Oh shit, oh I'm timed.

1614

1637
02:01:30,060 --> 02:01:31,080
It's my life on the line.

1638
02:01:31,480 --> 02:01:32,680
I'm done listening to you.

1639
02:01:33,240 --> 02:01:36,840
The thing's gonna blow that man's arm off and there's a whole building with me in it.

1640
02:01:36,980 --> 02:01:37,340
Fuck off.

1641
02:01:37,520 --> 02:01:38,300
I'm disarming the device.

1642
02:01:38,540 --> 02:01:39,500
No, Invisig out?

1643
02:01:39,680 --> 02:01:40,620

1644
02:01:40,860 --> 02:01:42,340
Wait, she doesn't even care?

1645
02:01:44,280 --> 02:01:44,720
What?

1646
02:01:44,720 --> 02:01:45,160
I...

1647
02:01:45,160 --> 02:01:46,420
She didn't even listen to me!

1648
02:01:47,600 --> 02:01:48,040
Bro!

1649
02:01:48,960 --> 02:01:49,800
Oh, fuck.

1650
02:01:50,300 --> 02:01:50,540

1651
02:01:51,820 --> 02:01:52,640

1652
02:01:52,900 --> 02:01:54,140

02:01:54,480 --> 02:01:55,300
Oh, his ass?

1654
02:01:58,800 --> 02:01:59,960
She's gone rogue!

1655
02:02:08,320 --> 02:02:11,760
I think he must have had something else to do because he left.

1656
02:02:16,490 --> 02:02:17,890
Oh wait, does he have life insurance?

1657
02:02:18,250 --> 02:02:19,110
Oh, he's alive?

1658
02:02:20,730 --> 02:02:22,590
You think he'll still be subscribed?

1659
02:02:23,770 --> 02:02:26,810
Guys, do you think he'll cancel his subscription, guys?

1660
02:02:27,230 --> 02:02:30,230
Sometimes people, you know, get electrical burns.

1661
02:02:30,390 --> 02:02:32,050
She disobeyed a direct order.

1662
02:02:32,950 --> 02:02:54,950

1664
02:03:03,430 --> 02:03:05,370
It wasn't even my fault.

1665
02:03:06,830 --> 02:03:09,490
Bro, one of the failures wasn't even my fault.

1666
02:03:12,430 --> 02:03:13,890
Take a hero out of resting.

1667
02:03:15,870 --> 02:03:17,150

1668
02:03:22,670 --> 02:03:23,410

Here's one hero to receive the combat skill upgrade.

1670
02:03:31,330 --> 02:03:31,530
Oh.

1671
02:03:31,910 --> 02:03:32,110
Oh.

1672
02:03:32,850 --> 02:03:35,130
Do I want to be stronger?

1673
02:03:37,010 --> 02:03:37,470
Alright, you guys.

1674
02:03:37,470 --> 02:03:37,870
You guys.

1675
02:03:37,950 --> 02:03:38,430

1676
02:03:38,970 --> 02:03:40,030
Well, I'll let you guys pick.

1677
02:03:40,150 --> 02:03:40,650
You know what?

1678
02:03:40,750 --> 02:03:41,790
I'll let you guys pick.

1679
02:03:41,950 --> 02:03:42,630
Punch up.

1680
02:03:47,820 --> 02:03:48,440
Punch up?

1681
02:03:48,580 --> 02:03:48,820
Alright.

1682
02:03:49,340 --> 02:03:51,140
I'll give Punch up his little combat.

1683
02:03:51,380 --> 02:03:51,560
Yeah.

1684
02:03:52,140 --> 02:03:54,380
I'll let you guys customize my team.

1685
02:03:55,600 --> 02:03:56,400
We do it together.

1686
02:03:56,620 --> 02:03:57,360
We're a team.

1687
02:04:00,800 --> 02:04:01,580
Oh, hey, Twinkie.

1688
02:04:02,220 --> 02:04:03,040
Oh, yeah, they're back.

1689
02:04:03,600 --> 02:04:04,040
Oh!

1690
02:04:17,720 --> 02:04:18,600
Oh, gross.

1691
02:04:19,480 --> 02:04:21,320
What kind of superhero flinches?

1692
02:04:23,480 --> 02:04:24,700
I'm just a dispatcher.

1693
02:04:27,460 --> 02:04:31,780
If you had people trying to kill you for the last 15 years, you'd be jumpy too.

1694
02:04:32,600 --> 02:04:34,380
What makes you think my life has been any different?

1695
02:04:34,820 --> 02:04:38,580
You think growing up surrounded by a bunch of shipbag villains I didn't need to watch my back?

1696
02:04:39,200 --> 02:04:40,400
I can't just disappear.

1697
02:04:40,620 --> 02:04:42,980
Yeah, I actually have to face my problems.

1698
02:04:43,800 --> 02:04:44,280
What the fuck?

1699
02:04:44,660 --> 02:04:45,900
You can't just go around.

1700
02:04:46,580 --> 02:04:47,860
Why is he keep screaming?

1701
02:04:48,020 --> 02:04:49,080
His name's Sonar.

1702
02:04:49,660 --> 02:05:23,020
is he blind what's up what are you asking why are you explaining your um you know what never mind good shift this guy is weird yeah he is look i actually just came by to celebrate the mission going well didn't mean to interrupt your little snack what do you need to preach you like a little baby bird bitch you ignored my order direct order how can you exactly soldier trash the place the suspect got away you got the client hurt you think when that guy signed up for sd and the in the back of his ball sack getting scorched because they don't mention that in the commercials.

1703
02:05:23,240 --> 02:05:25,280
First of all, the place was trashed when I got there.

1704
02:05:25,680 --> 02:05:29,060
Second, I'm sure Granny would take some crispy nuts over losing his arm.

1705
02:05:29,500 --> 02:05:31,620
As far as the bad guy, fuck shit happens.

1706
02:05:32,040 --> 02:05:33,980
The fact of the matter is that shit didn't need to happen.

1707
02:05:34,140 --> 02:05:35,480
Yeah, because what the fuck was he saying?

1708
02:05:35,680 --> 02:05:39,140
It doesn't get fried and we get the perp if you had just fucking listened to me.

1709
02:05:39,680 --> 02:05:42,060
You ask for help, then I can...

1710
02:05:42,060 --> 02:05:42,820
What?

1711
02:05:42,960 --> 02:05:43,540
What's he doing?

1712
02:05:45,260 --> 02:05:47,000
What the fuck is he grinding, Coffee?

1713
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:48,780
I make the calls, not you.

1714
02:05:49,580 --> 02:06:35,560

1715
02:06:41,820 --> 02:06:47,920

1716
02:06:48,360 --> 02:06:49,420
What the fuck?

1717
02:06:52,300 --> 02:06:54,360
What happened to your nose?

1718
02:06:55,440 --> 02:06:56,160
Here we go.

1719
02:06:56,780 --> 02:06:59,300
You have a tissue hanging from your nose, Robert.

1720
02:06:59,960 --> 02:07:01,060
I was trying to ignore it.

1721
02:07:01,280 --> 02:07:02,540
Invisi, yeah, so I'm going to snitch.

1722
02:07:03,460 --> 02:07:04,200
I'm snitching.

1723
02:07:05,800 --> 02:07:07,360
Invisi got punched me in the face.

1724
02:07:07,800 --> 02:07:08,560
But I asked for it.

1725
02:07:08,580 --> 02:07:09,780
Robert, this is serious.

1726
02:07:10,060 --> 02:07:10,960
Bro, this game is so good.

1727
02:07:11,120 --> 02:07:12,200
I'm clearly got here playing it.

1728
02:07:12,500 --> 02:07:13,460
I think it was super chat.

1729
02:07:13,540 --> 02:07:13,720
Thank you.

1730
02:07:13,880 --> 02:07:14,340
Thank you.

1731
02:07:14,380 --> 02:07:16,000
I literally asked for it.

1732
02:07:16,020 --> 02:07:18,180
I've been enjoying the series so far.

1733
02:07:18,660 --> 02:07:19,100
I...

1734
02:07:19,100 --> 02:07:22,100
He eats swings and I can't romance him exactly.

1735
02:07:22,380 --> 02:07:23,840
Let's go with that.

1736
02:07:24,280 --> 02:07:24,880
I'm a fucking nerd.

1737
02:07:24,900 --> 02:07:26,160
I'm here to assist Robert's first shift.

1738
02:07:26,620 --> 02:07:30,200
And aside from whatever happened here, I thought it was...

1739
02:07:30,200 --> 02:07:31,100
She punched me!

1740
02:07:31,460 --> 02:07:32,520
I'm reporting to HR.

1741
02:07:32,980 --> 02:07:33,740
I was watching on the monitor.

1742
02:07:34,020 --> 02:07:35,460
The work you did dispatching.

1743
02:07:35,780 --> 02:07:38,380
I don't think the Z team has ever had a better shift than that.

1744
02:07:38,440 --> 02:07:41,480
We just might need to confront the fact that it might be the best they can do.

1745
02:07:41,740 --> 02:07:43,080
Especially the way the Granny Penguin.

1746
02:07:43,580 --> 02:07:44,820
Oh yeah, the Z team.

1747
02:07:46,080 --> 02:08:47,460
ideal but I've seen so much worse with invisible let's be real she ain't gonna make it she's difficult to work with sure but I see a lot of promise in her really even the other Z-teamers respect her they're afraid of her I should have done better maybe a couple wires got crossed toward the end there I could have been guys what do you mean the romance option is God I'm gonna save it okay I'll save it cost them for you I'm gonna save it you should be proud the bar is very low with this group well it's not low for me look i like to make a joke and keep things light as much as the next person but when it comes to where i could turn it around here if you want the phoenix program to survive the bar needs to go up and how would we do that by treating the z team like what they are a bunch of villains and leading a supervillain team takes a different approach than a superhero team i need to be around them i need them to see i'm all in and they love the only kind i know and based on what i've

1748
02:08:47,460 --> 02:09:42,020
seen the only version they'll respond to i'm not saying everyone will make it they won't i'm not saying it won't get spicy it will but when it does i also need you to trust me to handle it i don't want you stepping in they need to respect me even if i don't have powers okay we'll do it your way monday we'll get them in a room and introduce them to their new super villain leader i can't promise at work i can only promise that i'll do my best what if i like poached them and start my own company way more fun to watch but then it's for like super villains only so it's like people have to subscribe to us to make sure we don't kill them i feel like that's more money hey kid what i think what are you doing yeah no no no no i get it did this it's so it's weird because yeah i saw So it's a mob.

1749
02:09:47,600 --> 02:09:49,640
Yeah, and they don't want to unsubscribe.

1750
02:09:49,880 --> 02:09:51,280
The moment they unsubscribe, they're dead.

1751
02:09:54,740 --> 02:09:57,320
So people who aren't subscribed, they get killed.

1752
02:09:58,400 --> 02:10:01,880
And we get more customers because people don't want to die.

1753
02:10:01,980 --> 02:10:04,140
See, I'm SDN's newest.

1754
02:10:04,500 --> 02:10:07,240
The moment they unsubscribe, it's fucking over.

1755

1759
02:10:48,080 --> 02:10:48,520
All right.

1760
02:10:49,420 --> 02:10:51,340
I mean, I'm not contingent on you as a busy team.

1761
02:10:51,900 --> 02:10:53,320
I want to do that to you.

1762
02:10:53,420 --> 02:10:54,260
It's good to know.

1763
02:10:54,760 --> 02:10:56,020
But don't worry about that.

1764
02:10:56,260 --> 02:10:56,680
I'm just...

1765
02:10:56,680 --> 02:10:58,300
I mean, shouldn't have ass.

1766
02:10:58,540 --> 02:10:58,960
I shouldn't.

1767
02:10:59,540 --> 02:11:01,240
No, do you want to grab dinner?

1768
02:11:01,880 --> 02:11:04,620
Hey, so do you want to grab dinner or something?

1769
02:11:04,860 --> 02:11:07,880
Like, as like platonic, you know, platonic friends, you know?

1770
02:11:10,120 --> 02:11:11,880
There's something I've been meaning to tell you.

1771
02:11:12,420 --> 02:11:16,620
It's a little awkward to mention, but since the other night, I...

1772
02:11:16,620 --> 02:11:17,280
Blonde Blazer.

1773
02:11:18,280 --> 02:11:18,580
Hey.

1774
02:11:19,640 --> 02:11:20,740
Oh, it's that guy.

1775
02:11:21,160 --> 02:11:21,680
He's...

1776
02:11:21,680 --> 02:11:23,360
He was in the commercial that we saw.

1777
02:11:24,580 --> 02:11:25,100
What?

1778
02:11:26,700 --> 02:11:27,720
Who is this?

1779
02:11:28,100 --> 02:11:30,840
I thought I'd catalogued all of your work companions.

1780
02:11:31,160 --> 02:11:32,320
You hoi!

1781
02:11:33,480 --> 02:11:36,180
Oh my god, it's so proud of music.

1782
02:11:36,540 --> 02:11:42,780
Oh my god, Bowser Jr. Robertson, leader of the Phoenixes.

1783
02:11:43,120 --> 02:11:44,660
Blonde Blazer told me about you.

1784
02:11:45,580 --> 02:11:48,820
Did she say, I don't know, what came up in that talk?

1785
02:11:49,280 --> 02:11:53,060
She said you're a capable, honorable man that truly cares for others.

1786
02:11:54,240 --> 02:11:55,220
Why are you so small?

1787
02:11:55,320 --> 02:11:56,320
Hey, come on.

1788
02:11:56,520 --> 02:11:57,460
You gotta stop asking people.

1789
02:11:57,460 --> 02:11:58,680
Oh, it's above average.

1790
02:12:00,340 --> 02:12:03,100
It's not about the size.

1791
02:12:03,340 --> 02:12:03,920
It's the flow.

1792
02:12:04,080 --> 02:12:05,460
It's all about how you use it.

1793
02:12:05,600 --> 02:12:06,720
It's the flow of the ocean.

1794
02:12:07,140 --> 02:12:08,800
Was his lack of size and strength an issue?

1795
02:12:09,100 --> 02:12:09,900
No, he was great.

1796
02:12:10,120 --> 02:12:43,600

1798
02:12:45,380 --> 02:12:46,460
Yeah, I think he would die.

1799
02:12:46,740 --> 02:12:49,360
Oh, no Perhaps another time.

1800
02:12:49,620 --> 02:12:53,740

What the fuck?

1803
02:12:55,320 --> 02:12:55,920
What the fuck?

1804
02:12:56,020 --> 02:12:58,480
Why did you not tell me you were dating him?

1805
02:12:58,800 --> 02:13:04,540
He flies a little faster She's just like two days ago.

1806
02:13:04,620 --> 02:13:04,980
A pleasure.

1807
02:13:05,240 --> 02:13:06,580
Now, could you step back?

1808
02:13:07,080 --> 02:13:08,020
The power of my life.

1809
02:13:08,020 --> 02:13:10,080
She has no right to say what the fuck.

1810
02:13:12,880 --> 02:13:13,300
Phenomenal.

1811
02:13:14,500 --> 02:13:15,140
Oh, shit.

1812
02:13:15,280 --> 02:13:16,720
Yeah, he flies a lot faster.

1813
02:13:19,220 --> 02:13:20,800
There's no such thing as it's complicated.

1814
02:13:21,020 --> 02:13:22,740
Just be like, I'm dating someone.

1815
02:13:25,720 --> 02:13:26,760
What the fuck do you mean?

1816
02:13:27,200 --> 02:13:28,820
She said it's complicated.

1817
02:13:29,200 --> 02:13:30,440
You know what she could have said?

1818
02:13:30,740 --> 02:13:31,100
Sorry.

1819
02:13:31,560 --> 02:13:32,520
I didn't mean it, but.

1820
02:13:33,080 --> 02:13:34,060
Flare with you.

1821
02:13:34,400 --> 02:13:35,400
I have a boyfriend.

1822
02:13:36,240 --> 02:13:37,660
That's all you have to say.

1823
02:13:43,780 --> 02:13:44,740
Yeah, uncomplicated.

1824
02:13:47,060 --> 02:13:47,920
You know what's that saying?

1825
02:13:48,280 --> 02:13:50,080
What you can say other than it's complicated?

1826
02:13:50,400 --> 02:13:51,360
I have a boyfriend.

1827
02:13:51,900 --> 02:13:53,180

02:21:30,710 --> 02:21:31,690
That didn't finish.

1851
02:21:31,810 --> 02:21:32,690
So, I can...

1852
02:21:32,690 --> 02:21:33,010

1854
02:21:34,290 --> 02:21:35,290
Finish shit today.

1855
02:21:46,970 --> 02:21:47,770
Fuck up.

1856
02:21:50,150 --> 02:21:50,730
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1857
02:21:50,930 --> 02:21:52,030
Hey, what are you doing?

1858
02:21:52,310 --> 02:21:52,530
Brother.

1859
02:21:53,450 --> 02:21:54,110
You're warranty.

1860
02:21:54,930 --> 02:21:55,630
Are ready, boy.

1861
02:21:56,070 --> 02:21:57,810
I don't know about finishing this game today.

1862
02:21:59,030 --> 02:21:59,250
We'll see.

1863
02:21:59,330 --> 02:22:00,670
We'll see you in chapter four.

1864
02:22:00,930 --> 02:22:01,430
No worries.

1865
02:22:01,590 --> 02:22:02,390
I'm pretty strong.

1866
02:22:02,770 --> 02:22:03,710
That's not what I'm saying.

1867
02:22:04,430 --> 02:22:06,330
How you got this thing inside your apartment anyways?

1868
02:22:06,570 --> 02:22:07,810
Oh, super heavy, the bugger.

1869
02:22:07,930 --> 02:22:11,950
I disassembled it and took it in little pieces, which is what I thought you'd be doing.

1870
02:22:12,350 --> 02:22:13,450
And how long does that take you?

1871
02:22:14,710 --> 02:23:09,610
no it was four days i get 20 minutes that's true it just feels like you could be a little gentler with it it is you know my whole fucking life every time i walk in this place i get sad that don't happen to you no one ever told you i'm poor i'm poor why do you think i take this job here does that make you feel good subscribers you're not poor if you can keep this suit going like uh where you sleep uh the chair figuring that out you're figuring that out huh so even the beef got a bed this is the type of apartment you see when the detective kicked the door in you know shine the flashlight serial killer all right i get it can we focus on where the astropos at lost in the blast while i was flying no clue where it landed bro this is like i spent a couple weeks after it happened trying to track it down it powered a whole suit yes the only piece of the suit my dad didn't have schematics for.

1872
02:23:10,130 --> 02:23:10,790
Is that going to be a problem?

1873
02:23:12,850 --> 02:23:13,910
Ah, mine now.

1874
02:23:14,130 --> 02:23:16,610
That's really how I live, too.

1875
02:23:16,870 --> 02:23:20,270
How'd you know about the Astral Pulse?

1876
02:23:20,790 --> 02:23:22,570
It's actually two wicked pieces of tech, huh?

1877
02:23:22,910 --> 02:23:26,110
First you get the Astral Pulse, this genius design energy cell.

1878
02:23:26,470 --> 02:23:28,250
But inside them, you get the stellar core.

1879
02:23:28,570 --> 02:23:29,090
Can I help?

1880
02:23:29,410 --> 02:23:29,870
No, brother.

1881
02:23:30,310 --> 02:23:30,830
You good.

1882
02:23:31,870 --> 02:23:36,230
What's crazy is when you mix the control fusion reactions with the plasma containment.

1883
02:23:36,490 --> 02:23:37,170
Oh, brother.

1884
02:23:37,370 --> 02:23:38,050
You got a core?

1885
02:23:38,070 --> 02:23:52,510
one super crazy energized plasma state unreal stuff like you caught one small star and chop him in a bottle genius oh this sounds pretty fucking important you said we're good actual paul super awesome but uh we'll be all right

1886
02:23:56,290 --> 02:24:08,970
maybe we go for a lot of medals this time huh you know i actually met your dad one time long time ago first time i come mainland He'll catch me trying for steal stuff from radio shack.

1887
02:24:09,550 --> 02:24:15,950
Then we talk tech stuff for like an whole hour Then he would take me jail That's how I ended up in a Phoenix program.

1888
02:24:15,950 --> 02:24:17,650
Oh, he was a villain conversation.

1889
02:24:17,970 --> 02:24:21,370
I ever had with him Yes,

1890
02:24:24,610 --> 02:24:27,090
when you're building astropulses, there's not much time.

1891
02:24:27,730 --> 02:24:45,570
Oh, yeah, he has big daddy issues not so sure about that I don't understand you see there's gear heads then there's science nerds one kind garage the other kind You know your father on good gear head, but I just can't see how he'll make something like the pulse You know science nerd how would you know this from talking to him?

1892
02:24:45,690 --> 02:24:51,470
Maybe he used to work with Shroud because I'm both True, I'm the one gonna fix your suit.

1893
02:24:53,550 --> 02:24:56,070
Oh My god, what if Shroud was the one that made him the thing?

1894
02:25:01,160 --> 02:25:09,080
That one over there that's your father's suit We gonna make this one the robber's suit the robber?

1895
02:25:09,100 --> 02:25:10,480
garbage, dude.

1896
02:25:11,800 --> 02:25:14,100
This is incredible, Royd.

1897
02:25:21,050 --> 02:25:22,390
Oh, you're so bad.

1898
02:25:23,590 --> 02:25:25,090
Royd, I don't know what to say.

1899
02:25:25,590 --> 02:25:26,170
Thank you.

1900
02:25:26,950 --> 02:25:28,810
Thank you is what I need to say.

1901
02:25:29,010 --> 02:25:30,390
This is unreal.

1902
02:25:30,870 --> 02:25:32,510
We make the man mecha again.

1903
02:25:40,800 --> 02:25:43,420
Oh my god, I'm gonna have a job again.

1904
02:25:43,900 --> 02:25:46,120
Or like, I guess technically it wasn't my job.

1905
02:25:46,200 --> 02:25:46,840
I was doing it for free.

1906
02:25:49,500 --> 02:25:50,540
My phone!

1907
02:25:51,880 --> 02:25:53,380
Watch where you're going, bro!

1908
02:25:54,620 --> 02:25:54,880
Hey!

1909
02:25:55,360 --> 02:25:55,720
Yeah.

1910
02:25:56,160 --> 02:25:56,920
Watch where you're going.

1911
02:25:58,820 --> 02:26:00,320
I think you did that on purpose.

1912
02:26:02,120 --> 02:26:02,760
That's right.

1913
02:26:03,140 --> 02:26:04,560
I fend for myself.

1914
02:26:05,780 --> 02:26:08,300
I'm not gonna let him walk over me just because he's made a play.

1915
02:26:10,080 --> 02:26:11,160
I'm his manager.

1916
02:26:12,860 --> 02:26:13,540
What is rude?

1917
02:26:13,600 --> 02:26:14,980
He bumped into me!

1918
02:26:16,500 --> 02:26:17,400
Hey, Chase.

1919
02:26:17,600 --> 02:26:18,380
I need a favor.

1920
02:26:18,920 --> 02:26:20,520
How am I the rude man?

1921
02:26:20,580 --> 02:26:23,860
It's not enough of a favor getting you this job working with those stupid ass pieces of...

1922
02:26:23,860 --> 02:26:25,600
Oh, who's this, huh?

1923
02:26:26,120 --> 02:26:27,260
Who's this little guy?

1924
02:26:27,680 --> 02:26:30,060
His name's Beef and he's the favor.

1925
02:26:30,600 --> 02:26:31,700
You mind keeping an eye out?

1926
02:26:32,240 --> 02:26:35,360
I feel bad leaving him at home, but I don't want anything happening to him.

1927
02:26:35,580 --> 02:26:39,920
Robert, I would literally let everyone here melt in eternal hell including you.

1928
02:26:39,940 --> 02:26:40,760
He's like Toby.

1929
02:26:41,400 --> 02:26:42,060
I'm sorry.

1930
02:26:42,700 --> 02:26:44,940
Oh, what's your name, little guy?

1931
02:26:45,800 --> 02:26:47,700
My name's Beef and I'm naked.

1932
02:26:48,460 --> 02:26:51,040
No, I refuse to believe that's what he sounds like.

1933
02:26:52,140 --> 02:26:52,780
Robert, you got a sec.

1934
02:26:53,260 --> 02:26:54,080
Sure, yeah.

1935
02:26:55,840 --> 02:26:56,740
I'm going to tell him.

1936
02:26:59,520 --> 02:27:00,860
Yeah, I'm going to tell him.

1937
02:27:01,320 --> 02:27:02,140
He's like, don't tell him.

1938
02:27:02,420 --> 02:27:03,340
Don't tell him I cheated.

1939
02:27:03,680 --> 02:27:05,960
About the other day with Phenomena Man.

1940
02:27:06,140 --> 02:27:06,560
Oh, yeah.

1941
02:27:07,060 --> 02:27:07,600
How's dinner?

1942
02:27:08,340 --> 02:27:09,300
Oh, it was awkward.

1943
02:27:09,800 --> 02:27:11,220
It's why I didn't want you to come.

1944
02:27:12,180 --> 02:27:12,940
Phenomena and I...

1945
02:27:12,940 --> 02:27:14,540
Oh, wait, she broke up with him?

1946
02:27:14,540 --> 02:27:15,340
You were talking to John Sushi?

1947
02:27:15,660 --> 02:27:15,860
Yeah.

1948
02:27:16,520 --> 02:27:17,140
It's just...

1949
02:27:17,140 --> 02:27:18,360
Oh, my God, I have a chance now.

1950
02:27:18,460 --> 02:27:46,780
timing felt right I don't know sometimes you just gotta shake shut up it felt a little impulsive but maybe I'm coming it's hard to say what did I contribute I do it oh why would you have contributed to it guess that means I didn't which is what I was hoping for it is what it is over sushi actually not what I wanted to talk to you about I was thinking about it over the weekend and I'm going to cut someone from the Z team.

1951
02:27:46,920 --> 02:27:47,580
You want to be rebound?

1952
02:27:47,820 --> 02:27:49,140
A fucking course I do.

1953
02:27:50,480 --> 02:27:52,100
That's your bro.

1954
02:27:52,300 --> 02:27:53,300
She's a muscle mommy.

1955
02:27:53,940 --> 02:27:54,160
Urgency.

1956
02:27:56,660 --> 02:27:57,620
You sure about that?

1957
02:27:58,800 --> 02:28:00,340
Well, less sure now.

1958
02:28:00,760 --> 02:28:01,540
You think it's a bad idea?

1959
02:28:02,160 --> 02:28:04,420
I'm just not sure how it'll play out.

1960
02:28:05,420 --> 02:28:10,420
The reality is cutting someone towards the bottom of the leaderboards will show everyone we're serious.

1961
02:28:11,600 --> 02:28:12,440
And they're not at the bottom.

1962
02:28:12,700 --> 02:28:13,260
I'll let the team know.

1963
02:28:13,460 --> 02:28:14,440
Oh, I already did.

1964
02:28:14,740 --> 02:28:15,060
What?

1965
02:28:15,480 --> 02:28:17,960
I suppose it'll be an interesting shift.

1966
02:28:18,900 --> 02:28:20,120
Oh, they're all going to compete.

1967
02:28:20,400 --> 02:28:21,760
Compete it with each other.

1968
02:28:25,280 --> 02:28:27,420
Oh, this is a gal.

1969
02:28:27,660 --> 02:28:28,660
Yeah, she ain't bad.

1970
02:28:28,960 --> 02:28:29,220
Oh.

1971
02:28:29,700 --> 02:28:31,300
Did you come over here to tell me that?

1972
02:28:32,660 --> 02:28:33,920
Wait, Sonar's second last?

1973
02:28:34,780 --> 02:28:35,900
Actually, smart ass.

1974
02:28:35,980 --> 02:28:38,420
I came over to tell you that she's second last.

1975
02:28:43,010 --> 02:28:44,630
Bro, he was killing it.

1976
02:28:45,670 --> 02:28:46,870
Sonar, you all right?

1977
02:28:46,950 --> 02:28:49,890
Why are you sending a distress call when you haven't left the building?

1978
02:28:49,910 --> 02:28:51,870
Could you send a locksmith downstairs?

1979
02:28:52,230 --> 02:28:52,950
What happened?

1980
02:28:53,030 --> 02:28:53,410
What happened?

1981
02:28:54,250 --> 02:28:55,850
Coop seduced me.

1982
02:28:56,210 --> 02:28:56,610
No.

1983
02:28:57,330 --> 02:28:58,750
I said, hey, I want to say something cool.

1984
02:28:59,010 --> 02:28:59,430
And then...

1985
02:29:02,330 --> 02:29:03,810
So I assumed you meant boobs.

1986
02:29:04,530 --> 02:29:09,290
Do you need to make those or mention someone's getting cut, but don't let that distract you from doing a good job out there?

1987
02:29:09,570 --> 02:29:10,830
You graduated from Harvard, guys.

1988
02:29:11,290 --> 02:29:12,770
What a bunch of bullshit.

1989
02:29:13,110 --> 02:29:13,470
Sorry.

1990
02:29:13,750 --> 02:29:14,270
What's bullshit?

1991
02:29:14,490 --> 02:29:15,690
Which will happen to anyone.

1992
02:29:16,030 --> 02:29:16,510
How is that?

1993
02:29:16,530 --> 02:29:17,730
Yeah, only God can judge me.

1994
02:29:18,150 --> 02:29:18,530
Okay.

1995
02:29:18,750 --> 02:29:19,150
False.

1996
02:29:19,850 --> 02:30:14,990
no one can judge me but god also false of course i'm being judged along with the rest of you are you do not know what a job is what the hell is going on wait wait it's all right fine just ignore the pressure and do your jobs you don't need to be first you just can't be last uh what about me can somebody go down to the gym and help bat boner who the guy who's shaped like a bat losing feeling in my hand and he was gonna help him kinky way there was an altercation with my team and a monster down at the beach and there's some debris of little giant monster large media and civvy okay so we need someone to be able to move okay we need someone with charisma And,

02:30:16,070 --> 02:30:16,570
There we go.

1999
02:30:16,590 --> 02:30:17,650
I think we can pull this off.

2000
02:30:18,210 --> 02:30:18,690
Wait, what?

2001
02:30:20,230 --> 02:30:21,730
I didn't put you in there.

2002
02:30:22,370 --> 02:30:22,530
What?

2003
02:30:23,870 --> 02:30:24,390
What?

2004
02:30:29,800 --> 02:30:30,320
Okay.

2005
02:30:30,860 --> 02:30:32,140
You look different.

2006
02:30:33,620 --> 02:30:38,100
On a call with certain slasks, me, Grant Plessed, and I must utter as when Golem is assigned.

2007
02:30:38,740 --> 02:30:38,740
Okay.

2008
02:30:38,980 --> 02:30:39,260
What?

2009
02:30:39,260 --> 02:30:39,980
Watch and learn.

2010
02:30:41,400 --> 02:30:41,920
What?

2011
02:30:41,920 --> 02:30:43,500
Oh, they're competing now.

2012
02:30:44,100 --> 02:30:44,820
Oh, shit.

2013
02:30:45,100 --> 02:30:45,420
Okay.

2014
02:30:48,220 --> 02:30:48,780
Okay.

2015
02:30:50,740 --> 02:30:52,320
Yeah, we can do this.

2016
02:30:54,880 --> 02:30:55,420
That's fine.

2017
02:30:56,280 --> 02:30:56,620
What?

2018
02:30:57,940 --> 02:30:59,380
Go and put laxatives.

2019
02:30:59,900 --> 02:31:00,820
Are you serious?

2020
02:31:02,860 --> 02:31:03,760
Fight the power.

2021
02:31:03,840 --> 02:31:05,240
Force it out of your...

2022
02:31:05,240 --> 02:31:05,600
Okay.

2023
02:31:06,060 --> 02:31:07,460
Bro, you're working to...

2024
02:31:07,460 --> 02:31:08,900
You're not even last.

2025
02:31:11,420 --> 02:31:13,660
Mine over focus on the job.

2026
02:31:13,720 --> 02:31:14,100
I don't know.

2027
02:31:14,360 --> 02:31:15,500
Force it out of your system?

2028
02:31:15,740 --> 02:31:17,340
Bro, just fucking poop it out.

2029
02:31:18,240 --> 02:31:44,760

2030
02:31:45,320 --> 02:31:50,040
You do realize that sabotaging each other isn't going to guarantee you a spot on the team, right?

2031
02:31:51,180 --> 02:31:52,020
Oh no.

2032
02:31:52,400 --> 02:31:52,980
Oh no.

2033
02:31:53,560 --> 02:31:54,600
Oh no.

2034
02:31:55,680 --> 02:31:56,000
Oh no.

2035
02:31:56,980 --> 02:31:58,360
Oh and he gets...

2036
02:31:58,360 --> 02:31:59,360
Okay, there's stats.

2037
02:31:59,560 --> 02:32:00,980
If it gets hurt, they'll become...

2038
02:32:00,980 --> 02:32:02,420
Okay, that's not good.

2039
02:32:02,700 --> 02:32:02,860
Okay.

2040
02:32:03,440 --> 02:32:04,400
This is...

2041
02:32:04,400 --> 02:32:05,160
Oh gosh.

2042
02:32:05,180 --> 02:32:07,640
There's a drug deal happening at the Torn's airport right now.

2043
02:32:08,060 --> 02:32:10,300
I think you should send the bat guy.

2044
02:32:10,720 --> 02:32:11,820
He's a striking job.

2045
02:32:13,100 --> 02:32:14,500
as a buyer.

2046
02:32:15,240 --> 02:32:18,820
Preferably someone highly educated on drugs.

2047
02:32:19,040 --> 02:32:20,340
Oh, that's Prism.

2048
02:32:24,120 --> 02:32:26,300
That's Prism, isn't it?

2049
02:32:27,440 --> 02:32:28,660
Yeah, that's...

2050
02:32:31,680 --> 02:32:33,680
Soder knows jobs.

2051
02:32:33,980 --> 02:32:34,400
Let's send...

2052
02:32:34,400 --> 02:32:34,900
I'm going!

2053
02:32:35,680 --> 02:32:38,880
Let's send the Prism and send the...

2054
02:32:38,880 --> 02:32:39,560
What's done?

2055
02:32:40,560 --> 02:32:41,560
Oh, man.

2056
02:32:42,200 --> 02:32:42,460
Why?

2057
02:32:42,460 --> 02:32:42,920
Bye-bye.

2058
02:32:43,820 --> 02:32:47,040
I feel Like, we'll send both of them.

2059
02:32:47,120 --> 02:32:48,320
You know, I'll send both of them in.

2060
02:32:50,340 --> 02:32:52,820
Sonar and Sonar who is recovering.

2061
02:32:54,660 --> 02:32:55,640
Here we go.

2062
02:32:56,480 --> 02:32:58,660
Maybe Prism can help him out.

2063
02:32:58,760 --> 02:32:59,540
Drug bust.

2064
02:33:00,360 --> 02:33:00,680
Fuck yeah.

2065
02:33:00,960 --> 02:33:02,320
My two favorite things.

2066
02:33:02,740 --> 02:33:03,800
Drugs and booze.

2067
02:33:04,020 --> 02:33:04,200
Oh.

2068
02:33:04,400 --> 02:33:04,720
Damn.

2069
02:33:05,100 --> 02:33:06,080
Seeing all my followers.

2070
02:33:06,320 --> 02:33:07,960
Sonar Docs who is now being...

2071
02:33:07,960 --> 02:33:08,540
Oh, what?

2072
02:33:09,080 --> 02:33:09,440
What?

2073
02:33:09,860 --> 02:33:11,540
Surprise drops are good for a brand.

2074
02:33:12,140 --> 02:33:13,400
Distract them with a sign.

2075
02:33:19,190 --> 02:34:19,150

2076
02:34:19,550 --> 02:34:21,190
I thought it was like bait shit.

2077
02:34:21,410 --> 02:34:21,670
You know?

2078
02:34:21,870 --> 02:34:22,110
I don't care.

2079
02:34:23,910 --> 02:34:25,030
I thought it was bait.

2080
02:34:26,210 --> 02:34:26,570
Combat.

2081
02:34:26,850 --> 02:34:28,070
Whatever you say.

2082
02:34:29,870 --> 02:34:29,930
Okay.

2083
02:34:30,130 --> 02:34:30,470
There we go.

2084
02:34:31,710 --> 02:34:32,750
Bring lots of firepower.

2085
02:34:32,830 --> 02:34:33,470
That's a lot.

2086
02:34:33,970 --> 02:34:36,610
Oh, but then they're like going to sabotage each other.

2087
02:34:37,450 --> 02:34:38,810
Why don't I just bring him?

2088
02:34:40,790 --> 02:34:41,210
Okay.

2089
02:34:45,610 --> 02:34:48,010
Surely if I send three people, they won't sabotage each other.

2090
02:34:48,090 --> 02:34:49,090
I feel like all three are going to sabotage each other.

2091
02:34:49,110 --> 02:35:03,450
just gonna sabotage each other though i'm pretty sure i don't think i don't yeah yeah i don't know i feel like all three are just gonna sabotage we follow the drug traffickers to their base near the refinery let's shut them down for good

2092
02:35:06,530 --> 02:35:19,950

2093
02:35:20,510 --> 02:35:21,690
He's a grown man bad hybrid.

2094
02:35:21,870 --> 02:35:22,910
He can figure it out himself.

2095
02:35:23,410 --> 02:35:24,950
Oh my god, track down the source.

2096
02:35:26,450 --> 02:35:27,670
I mean, we know it's coop.

2097
02:35:30,330 --> 02:35:31,410
We know it's coop.

2098
02:35:33,990 --> 02:35:35,130
Can you think he can?

2099
02:35:35,450 --> 02:35:37,350
I feel like...

2100
02:35:37,350 --> 02:35:39,890
I mean, what is he gonna do after he tracks her down?

2101
02:35:40,910 --> 02:35:41,710
Plug your ears.

2102
02:35:42,010 --> 02:35:42,730
You'll be fine.

2103
02:35:42,950 --> 02:35:44,310
You're not big... Yeah.

2104
02:35:45,210 --> 02:35:46,510
You can plug it up.

2105
02:35:48,190 --> 02:35:49,090
You cannot plug it up.

2106
02:35:49,110 --> 02:35:49,710
Get up.

2107
02:35:50,150 --> 02:35:50,770
He cannot.

2108
02:35:51,070 --> 02:35:51,650
Oh my god.

2109
02:35:52,010 --> 02:35:52,010
Okay.

2110
02:35:52,810 --> 02:35:52,810
Okay.

2111
02:35:53,190 --> 02:35:54,230
Okay guys.

2112
02:35:54,750 --> 02:35:55,690
Oh my god.

2113
02:35:56,150 --> 02:35:56,150
Okay

2114
02:36:00,250 --> 02:36:17,510
You know what I just kind of wanted to know if he could become one with it prideful okay incorporate into your body You're now you're now clay cement golem It's fine you can't get double hurt He can in fact get double hurt

2115
02:36:22,690 --> 02:36:24,310
He can indeed.

2116
02:36:25,430 --> 02:36:25,430
Okay.

2117
02:36:29,230 --> 02:36:29,630
Oh, God.

2118
02:36:29,930 --> 02:36:30,510
Just made it in.

2119
02:36:30,570 --> 02:36:31,210
Thank God.

2120
02:36:32,250 --> 02:36:33,830
That was too close.

2121
02:36:34,130 --> 02:36:35,170
That was so close.

2122
02:36:37,950 --> 02:36:38,130
Okay.

2123
02:36:39,050 --> 02:36:43,150
Hey, my grandma just got scammed by someone claiming they work for you guys.

2124
02:36:43,170 --> 02:36:45,170
Better intel on the scam and scammer.

2125
02:36:45,810 --> 02:36:45,950
Okay.

2126
02:36:46,290 --> 02:36:47,390
Social security numbers.

2127
02:36:48,090 --> 02:36:49,050
All the bad numbers.

2128
02:36:50,210 --> 02:36:51,230
Speak to it all, Victor.

2129
02:36:51,250 --> 02:36:52,310
You know what?

2130
02:36:52,330 --> 02:36:53,250
I can send...

2131
02:36:54,130 --> 02:36:56,050
I don't know who's best friends with each other.

2132
02:36:56,250 --> 02:36:56,930
I don't know.

2133
02:36:57,070 --> 02:36:58,030
I actually don't know.

2134
02:36:59,830 --> 02:37:00,550
Let's see it.

2135
02:37:00,610 --> 02:37:02,590
We'll put... more charisma.

2136
02:37:04,330 --> 02:37:05,330
And... you know what?

2137
02:37:06,330 --> 02:37:06,770
Charisma.

2138
02:37:07,550 --> 02:37:08,030
There you go.

2139
02:37:11,740 --> 02:37:12,900
Alright, oh they work together.

2140
02:37:12,960 --> 02:37:13,520
Okay, that's good.

2141
02:37:13,860 --> 02:37:14,720
Okay, that's not good.

2142
02:37:15,200 --> 02:37:15,820
We know that's good.

2143
02:37:15,860 --> 02:37:16,440
They work together.

2144
02:37:17,840 --> 02:37:20,120
Oh god, this is...

2145
02:37:20,120 --> 02:37:20,620
Scary?

2146
02:37:23,480 --> 02:37:24,160
Alright, that's good.

2147
02:37:24,240 --> 02:37:24,820
That's good, guys.

2148
02:37:25,340 --> 02:37:26,360
We're all proud of you.

2149
02:37:29,400 --> 02:37:30,540
We're all so proud of you.

2150
02:37:38,080 --> 02:37:38,960
Alright, uh...

2151
02:37:38,960 --> 02:37:40,640
Intel Gathering.

2152
02:37:40,780 --> 02:37:42,980
I feel like you gotta be smart for that, right?

2153
02:37:43,440 --> 02:37:45,420
Oh, but I don't have a smart person.

2154
02:37:45,900 --> 02:37:46,760
I mean...

2155
02:37:46,760 --> 02:37:47,440
Maybe?

2156
02:37:47,940 --> 02:37:49,080
You two work well together.

2157
02:37:50,180 --> 02:37:53,320
You got someone that can figure out how to stop a landslide?

2158
02:37:55,140 --> 02:37:57,620
As hot and threatening as that sounds.

2159
02:37:58,000 --> 02:37:59,080
I'm not going anywhere.

2160
02:37:59,620 --> 02:38:03,060
We're tied for the bottom with fucking invisigal.

2161
02:38:03,480 --> 02:38:04,200
Not for long.

2162
02:38:05,700 --> 02:38:07,180
Alright, so reinforced.

02:38:07,500 --> 02:38:08,520
Oh, okay, you guys.

Okay, that's fine.

2169
02:38:16,580 --> 02:38:17,040
It's fine.

2170
02:38:17,240 --> 02:38:18,040
Everything is fine.

2171
02:38:18,220 --> 02:38:18,680
It's fine.

2172
02:38:19,060 --> 02:38:19,580
It's fine.

2173
02:38:19,700 --> 02:38:20,340
You guys hate each other.

2174
02:38:20,880 --> 02:38:21,200
It's okay.

2175
02:38:21,200 --> 02:38:22,000

2176
02:38:23,880 --> 02:38:25,120

Or do I describe backstroke away?

2180
02:39:05,480 --> 02:39:06,800
Maybe I can swim away.

2181
02:39:08,640 --> 02:39:09,160
Where is that?

2182
02:39:09,260 --> 02:39:09,920

2185
02:39:14,060 --> 02:39:15,640
You should really see my butterfly stroke.

2186
02:39:20,530 --> 02:39:20,950
Alright.

2187
02:39:21,190 --> 02:39:24,590

Cash up with the rowdy's hands.

2189
02:39:26,890 --> 02:39:28,970

02:39:29,210 --> 02:39:30,330
Okay, oh, Shit.

Just walked into my sword with her face a little bit.

2205
02:39:54,410 --> 02:39:55,670

2206
02:39:56,550 --> 02:39:57,990
But I do believe in punching demons.

2207

Drowning in a sensory deprivation tank is not the kind of wet I like to be, Robert.

Lightning struck.

2296
02:46:39,880 --> 02:46:41,000
No shit?

2297
02:46:41,640 --> 02:46:42,060
That's crazy.

2298
02:46:42,520 --> 02:46:44,700
Don't piss off the fucking demons.

2299
02:46:50,320 --> 02:46:51,300
Oh shit.

2300
02:46:54,240 --> 02:46:58,620
I'd normally say cut her, but the way things are going, I'd cut the whole damn team.

2301
02:46:59,140 --> 02:47:00,140
You need a reset, Robbie.

2302
02:47:00,280 --> 02:47:04,420
All Z team back to base and in the conference room in 20 minutes.

2303
02:47:10,230 --> 02:47:11,150
11 calls.

2304
02:47:12,490 --> 02:47:13,090
Lack of team.

2305
02:47:13,250 --> 02:47:13,610
What?

2306
02:47:17,070 --> 02:47:18,690
It didn't even matter.

2307
02:47:29,620 --> 02:47:30,660
Is this scripted?

2308
02:47:32,860 --> 02:47:35,400
Is this scripted because I failed?

2309
02:47:40,210 --> 02:47:40,610
Happens.

2310
02:47:40,710 --> 02:47:41,370
Oh, it's scripted.

2311
02:47:41,490 --> 02:47:42,110
Okay, it's not me.

2312
02:47:42,470 --> 02:47:42,870
It's not me.

2313
02:47:42,990 --> 02:47:43,490
It's not my fault.

2314
02:47:44,810 --> 02:47:45,750
It's not my fault.

2315
02:47:45,930 --> 02:47:46,630
It's scripted.

2316
02:47:46,710 --> 02:47:47,290
Thank God.

2317
02:47:47,470 --> 02:47:48,390
I knew I wasn't the issue

2318
02:47:52,420 --> 02:47:54,280
It's not my fault

2319
02:47:59,500 --> 02:48:01,260
Anyone else think this is a waste of time?

2320
02:48:01,380 --> 02:48:02,780
Yeah, I know Like what are we doing?

2321
02:48:03,120 --> 02:48:04,360
What the fuck is the point is?

2322
02:48:04,580 --> 02:48:05,660
Try to be somewhere else.

2323
02:48:05,740 --> 02:48:07,040
I had a thousand better things to do.

If I can waste my time, let's go.

2333
02:49:27,620 --> 02:49:31,100
Okay, as you know, by the end of today, one of you will be cut from the Z team.

2334
02:49:31,380 --> 02:49:32,520
This is bullshit.

2335
02:49:32,760 --> 02:49:33,820
Yeah, you said that already.

2336
02:49:33,980 --> 02:49:35,960
Call me from a job I didn't want in the first place.

2337
02:49:36,340 --> 02:49:42,440
Miss Blazer, maybe if you gave us a dispatcher who knew what they were doing, you wouldn't have to throw no one out.

2338
02:49:42,440 --> 02:49:45,080
Hey, Nikki Mirage, I'm standing right here.

2339
02:49:45,340 --> 02:49:46,300
You can talk to me.

2340
02:49:46,820 --> 02:49:47,340
Whoa!

2341
02:49:48,540 --> 02:49:50,600
Which weak-ass superhero team did you come from?

2342
02:49:50,900 --> 02:49:51,680
Fucking geek squad?

2343
02:49:52,060 --> 02:49:53,640
Doesn't matter where I'm from, Cardi C.

2344
02:49:54,060 --> 02:49:57,780
What matters is I'm here to figure out who stays and who goes.

2345
02:49:57,860 --> 02:49:58,700
Yeah, chill, old lady.

2346
02:49:59,100 --> 02:49:59,240
Ha ha.

2347
02:49:59,740 --> 02:50:00,520
That's the man's hard.

2348
02:50:01,100 --> 02:50:01,780
Okay, what?

2349
02:50:01,980 --> 02:50:02,340
Damn.

2350
02:50:02,900 --> 02:50:04,020
You hipster motherfucker?

2351
02:50:04,480 --> 02:50:06,840
Over here looking like Mumford fucked all his sons.

2352
02:50:06,840 --> 02:50:08,100
That's not a bad leader?

2353
02:50:08,120 --> 02:50:08,640
That was funny.

2354
02:50:08,900 --> 02:50:09,080
See?

2355
02:50:09,500 --> 02:50:10,340
We're just busting balls.

2356
02:50:10,560 --> 02:50:11,180
Keep talking.

2357
02:50:11,780 --> 02:50:14,480
You won't have your tiny inbred balls left to bust.

2358
02:50:15,200 --> 02:50:16,400
Ask next time.

2359
02:50:16,800 --> 02:50:18,160
Where there won't be a next time.

2360
02:50:18,340 --> 02:50:19,740
Don't threaten me, you butt and I, bitch.

2361
02:50:20,100 --> 02:50:21,180
Oh, shit.

2362
02:50:22,620 --> 02:50:23,860
No, they're just bad people.

2363
02:50:24,100 --> 02:50:25,280
Most people will look around.

2364
02:50:25,520 --> 02:50:26,200
They're not fixable.

2365
02:50:26,360 --> 02:50:26,820
That's why.

2366
02:50:26,900 --> 02:50:27,560
And see a bunch of villains.

2367
02:50:27,580 --> 02:50:28,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2368
02:50:28,260 --> 02:50:29,160
They're just not fixable.

2369
02:50:29,420 --> 02:50:29,660
Not even super kind.

2370
02:50:29,900 --> 02:50:30,620
Just plain ass.

2371
02:50:30,720 --> 02:50:31,160
It's not my fault.

2372
02:50:31,480 --> 02:50:34,240
Run in the mill, vanilla fucking villains.

2373
02:50:35,200 --> 02:50:36,200
But that's not what I see.

2374
02:50:36,980 --> 02:50:39,400
Because lucky for you, I'm not most people.

2375
02:50:40,580 --> 02:50:43,760
When I look around this room, what I see is...

2376
02:50:45,140 --> 02:50:45,620
Potential.

2377
02:50:46,060 --> 02:50:46,440
Potential.

2378
02:50:46,800 --> 02:51:13,580
both are in the end unfortunately for you it's a curse because there isn't a thing in the universe that goes more wasted than potential and despite how common it is no one seems to forget it's what they whisper when you leave the room oh so and so had so much potential it follows you forever i'm here to help you lift the curse of potential by getting you to fucking do something with it

2379
02:51:16,800 --> 02:51:47,280
the phoenix program any of you know what a phoenix is oh um city in arizona yeah the sweltering ball sack of america nah then louisiana's got to be the ball sack just you know position the phoenix sorry attention man that was so tired of its immortality it tricked the sun god into dropping a spark on its nest to set it ablaze burning it to shit but instead of dying the phoenix emerged from ash Look,

2380
02:51:47,420 --> 02:51:51,020
I give them tough love and then, like, glaze them up.

2381
02:51:51,060 --> 02:51:53,920
All of you in this room are phoenixes, and it's obvious what that means.

2382
02:51:54,480 --> 02:51:56,920
But for you dumb ones, I'll spell it out.

2383
02:51:57,680 --> 02:51:58,840
I'm bad cop, good cop.

2384
02:51:59,120 --> 02:51:59,680
I'm both.

2385
02:52:00,140 --> 02:52:00,360
Redemption.

2386
02:52:01,260 --> 02:52:04,980
That's what you're here for, is what connects everyone in this room.

2387
02:52:05,580 --> 02:52:09,340
To burn up who you were, to become who you were meant to be.

2388
02:52:09,400 --> 02:52:10,600
You bad go, I'm kind of listening to this.

2389
02:52:10,600 --> 02:52:13,300
Phoenix is also a lame-ass band my lame-ass roommate listens to.

2390
02:52:13,560 --> 02:52:14,060
You're late.

2391
02:52:14,180 --> 02:52:14,860
I like that band.

2392
02:52:16,800 --> 02:52:17,960
I was here the whole time.

2393
02:52:18,320 --> 02:52:20,160
I turned invisible genius, remember?

2394
02:52:20,560 --> 02:52:20,960
Move it.

2395
02:52:21,800 --> 02:52:21,800
Great.

2396
02:52:22,300 --> 02:52:27,020
Then you know we're cutting someone, and you, Miss Hot Topic Sale, are at the bottom of the leaderboards.

2397
02:52:28,180 --> 02:52:29,380
Have a better second shift.

2398
02:52:30,920 --> 02:52:31,220
Oh.

2399
02:52:31,960 --> 02:52:33,180
What for a coupé?

2400
02:52:33,540 --> 02:52:35,680
We all know you'll just be working the roulette wheel.

2401
02:52:35,920 --> 02:52:37,200
That's a croupier, you idiot.

2402
02:52:37,440 --> 02:52:38,460
The fuck's a croupier.

2403
02:52:38,840 --> 02:52:40,680
I'm just saying, you're a degenerate gambler.

2404
02:52:50,760 --> 02:52:52,660
Oh, it's a second shift time?

2405
02:52:55,640 --> 02:53:22,720

Alright, this is 5.

2407
02:53:31,410 --> 02:53:32,310
Nah, he's cool.

2408
02:53:32,730 --> 02:53:33,970
Look, he's not cool.

2409
02:53:34,310 --> 02:53:37,870
My client requires protection while he does some shopping.

2410
02:53:38,430 --> 02:53:39,350
I remember this man.

2411
02:53:39,810 --> 02:53:40,870
And he's right to be paranoid.

2412
02:53:41,550 --> 02:53:43,410
Secret police hired me three years ago to kill him.

2413
02:53:44,050 --> 02:53:45,050
He pissed off the wrong dictator.

2414
02:53:45,450 --> 02:53:49,190
Protect the subscriber from ancient while he shops.

2415
02:53:50,010 --> 02:53:50,710
He can protect.

2416
02:53:51,050 --> 02:53:51,290
What?

2417
02:53:52,790 --> 02:53:53,590
Call him.

2418
02:53:54,690 --> 02:53:55,750
Call him.

2419
02:53:57,310 --> 02:53:59,050
There you go, Golem.

2420
02:54:00,230 --> 02:54:01,190
Protect the...

2421
02:54:01,190 --> 02:54:03,170
I feel like I need...

2422
02:54:03,170 --> 02:54:04,070
Bigger, right?

2423
02:54:04,330 --> 02:54:05,730
I was...

2424
02:54:07,670 --> 02:54:08,410
Yo, he's fine.

2425
02:54:08,550 --> 02:54:08,670
See?

2426
02:54:08,790 --> 02:54:09,850
I put him back in.

2427
02:54:11,490 --> 02:54:13,530
Prepare to fend off any incoming attack.

2428
02:54:13,690 --> 02:54:15,810
I feel like I should...

2429
02:54:15,810 --> 02:54:16,490
Be prepared.

2430
02:54:16,950 --> 02:54:18,510
Yeah, I feel like...

2431
02:54:18,510 --> 02:54:19,050
Fine.

2432
02:54:19,590 --> 02:54:20,030
There you go.

2433
02:54:20,770 --> 02:54:21,870
Yeah, he should be fine.

2434
02:54:22,190 --> 02:54:23,010
No, he's fine.

2435
02:54:23,230 --> 02:54:23,430
See?

2436
02:54:23,890 --> 02:54:24,750
He can't be Ingy.

2437
02:54:29,250 --> 02:54:31,730
You just gotta force him to work.

2438
02:54:34,930 --> 02:54:36,770
Yeah, and he has defense.

2439
02:54:38,550 --> 02:54:41,590
Some bitch just cut me in line at the Utopia concert.

2440
02:54:42,110 --> 02:54:43,850
I've been here for 12 fucking hours.

2441
02:54:44,890 --> 02:54:46,090
Utopia is a hack.

2442
02:54:46,490 --> 02:54:47,450
I like her.

2443
02:54:48,150 --> 02:54:49,870
You basic bat.

2444

Depends.

2448

Do you like the sensation of your ears bleeding?

2449
02:56:02,390 --> 02:56:03,510
I knew I should put prism.

2450
02:56:03,670 --> 02:56:04,130
I'm good.

2451
02:56:04,550 --> 02:56:04,770

02:56:05,830 --> 02:56:07,670
Oh, I knew I should have put prism.

2454
02:56:08,730 --> 02:56:10,890
Uh, serenade her.

2455
02:56:11,030 --> 02:56:11,750
Do we have enough?

2456
02:56:11,970 --> 02:56:13,150
That's charisma, right?

2457
02:56:13,690 --> 02:56:14,890
Yeah, that's charisma.

2458
02:56:15,090 --> 02:56:15,990
Fuck, I knew it.

2459
02:56:16,330 --> 02:56:16,970
I was thinking.

2460
02:56:20,250 --> 02:56:21,090
Oh, thank God.

2461
02:56:21,150 --> 02:56:21,970
Yeah, we have a lot.

2462
02:56:23,270 --> 02:56:24,370
I was thinking that was charisma.

2463
02:56:24,810 --> 02:56:25,130
And that's how we do it down under.

2464
02:56:27,070 --> 02:56:28,830
All right, we have an upgrade, too.

2465
02:56:30,550 --> 02:56:31,670
You know what?

2466
02:56:31,950 --> 02:56:34,530
We'll put you some combat as well.

2467
02:56:35,410 --> 02:56:36,090
Won't be bad.

2468
02:56:36,270 --> 02:56:38,450
Can't be too bad to be able to fight.

2469
02:56:40,350 --> 02:56:42,910
There's some kind of cult recruiting outside my store.

2470
02:56:43,090 --> 02:56:44,190
They're creeping everyone up.

2471
02:56:44,890 --> 02:56:46,930
Tell them to disperse immediately.

2472
02:56:48,410 --> 02:56:49,850
Who's smart enough for that?

2473
02:56:52,110 --> 02:56:55,090
I feel like that's on it.

2474
02:56:55,790 --> 02:56:56,870
Charism, right?

2475
02:56:57,370 --> 02:56:57,450
Wait.

2476
02:56:59,390 --> 02:57:00,290
That's charisma.

2477
02:57:01,570 --> 02:57:03,050
And what to identify them.

2478
02:57:03,310 --> 02:57:05,330
So by identifying, we use our brain.

2479
02:57:07,890 --> 02:57:09,950
So, who has more brain?

2480
02:57:12,710 --> 02:57:13,690
Are you kidding?

2481
02:57:14,650 --> 02:57:14,930
What?

2482
02:57:14,950 --> 02:57:15,610
You don't like her?

2483
02:57:15,950 --> 02:57:16,510
Since when?

2484
02:57:17,210 --> 02:57:18,010
I'm gonna make you like her.

2485
02:57:18,030 --> 02:57:20,110
I think there's also some kind of cult recruiting outside my store.

2486
02:57:20,190 --> 02:57:20,950
They're creeping everyone out.

2487
02:57:20,950 --> 02:57:22,130
Why don't you like her?

2488
02:57:25,090 --> 02:57:25,570
That's fine.

2489
02:57:26,210 --> 02:57:27,170
That's fine.

2490
02:57:28,990 --> 02:57:29,910
We don't need it.

2491
02:57:37,080 --> 02:57:37,560
Melvonia.

2492
02:57:39,920 --> 02:57:40,640
Free their minds.

2493
02:57:40,860 --> 02:57:41,900
I feel like that's intelligence.

2494
02:57:42,440 --> 02:57:43,200
Destroy their literature.

2495
02:57:48,390 --> 02:57:49,290
I don't know what...

2496
02:57:49,290 --> 02:57:51,110
Free their minds would be the...

2497
02:57:51,110 --> 02:57:51,710
The brain.

2498
02:57:51,830 --> 02:57:52,390
But I don't think...

2499
02:57:52,390 --> 02:57:54,030
I don't think I have enough...

2500
02:57:54,030 --> 02:57:56,770
I don't think I have enough, guys.

2501
02:58:01,660 --> 02:58:02,620
Because, like...

2502
02:58:02,620 --> 02:58:03,620
I have four.

2503
02:58:04,200 --> 02:58:05,320
I feel like destroy would...

2504
02:58:05,340 --> 02:58:06,500
be combat, right?

2505
02:58:07,340 --> 02:58:08,880
I have enough for combat.

2506
02:58:12,900 --> 02:58:13,500
Oh, thank God.

2507
02:58:13,620 --> 02:58:14,280
Yeah, I was gonna say.

2508
02:58:15,020 --> 02:58:15,640
That's right.

2509
02:58:15,820 --> 02:58:16,740
Burn the books!

2510
02:58:16,860 --> 02:58:17,880
I'm your hero, baby.

2511
02:58:18,060 --> 02:58:19,020
Burn it on!

2512
02:58:22,260 --> 02:58:23,160
That's right!

2513
02:58:23,600 --> 02:58:23,980
Yeah!

2514
02:58:24,840 --> 02:58:25,680
Burn it!

2515
02:58:25,880 --> 02:58:26,960
We don't need their book.

2516
02:58:27,100 --> 02:58:29,180
For some kind of fight club.

2517
02:58:29,600 --> 02:58:31,800
Shut down the underground fight club.

2518
02:58:32,260 --> 02:58:33,360
Anticipate resistance.

2519
02:58:34,060 --> 02:58:34,560
Alright.

2520
02:58:35,600 --> 02:58:37,900
You can fight What do you think you can shut this down?

2521
02:58:38,220 --> 02:58:38,800
Oh, shit.

2522
02:58:39,120 --> 02:58:39,660
Yeah, you're fine.

2523
02:58:41,880 --> 02:58:43,700
I think you guys are good friends, right?

2524
02:58:44,380 --> 02:58:44,740
You know what?

2525
02:58:44,740 --> 02:58:45,540
We can get two.

2526
02:58:45,680 --> 02:58:46,360
We don't need three.

2527
02:58:50,290 --> 02:58:51,130
Whatever you say, boss.

2528
02:58:51,270 --> 02:58:51,810
Fight in that fight club.

2529
02:58:52,070 --> 02:58:53,470
I still think this is a waste of time.

2530
02:58:55,830 --> 02:58:56,970
Don't worry, guys.

2531
02:58:58,430 --> 02:58:59,810
We'll watch this fight happen.

2532
02:58:59,910 --> 02:59:02,410
I'm going to bet for my team.

2533
02:59:02,550 --> 02:59:03,350
But he's still alive.

2534
02:59:04,210 --> 02:59:06,110
Protect the subscriber while he has lunch.

2535
02:59:06,250 --> 02:59:08,310
Be prepared to fend off any incoming attack.

2536
02:59:08,410 --> 02:59:30,530
I remember last time we got golden no cash no kill wait what SDN's always paid on time and in full so as long as the checks clear I will kill or protect all right there you go our men let us kill people around here who been men they see fit I feel like these two golden with invis why

2538
02:59:46,300 --> 02:59:48,220

2539
02:59:52,840 --> 02:59:54,220
Oh, yeah, no, 100%.

2540
02:59:54,220 --> 02:59:54,920
Thank God.

2541
02:59:56,300 --> 02:59:57,120
I'm on it.

2542
02:59:57,780 --> 02:59:58,380
There you go.

2543
02:59:58,980 --> 03:00:00,080
We won the fight club.

2544
03:00:00,680 --> 03:00:01,480
We did it, guys.

2545
03:00:01,560 --> 03:00:02,080
We won.

2546
03:00:04,400 --> 03:00:05,160
Oh, yeah, that's 100.

2547
03:00:06,040 --> 03:00:06,840
Let's go.

2548
03:00:07,240 --> 03:00:08,440
How'd you manage this one?

2549
03:00:08,700 --> 03:00:10,300
Yeah, I don't want to talk about it.

2550
03:00:10,940 --> 03:00:11,880
I've learned from my sources.

2551
03:00:11,980 --> 03:00:12,500
Where's she going?

2552
03:00:12,520 --> 03:00:14,340
The next tournament will be held at the refinery.

2553
03:00:14,800 --> 03:00:15,720
in one hour.

2554
03:00:16,540 --> 03:00:17,340
Why didn't the fight club?

2555
03:00:17,480 --> 03:00:18,060
Bro, fight in it!

2556
03:00:18,380 --> 03:00:19,700
Robert, send me in to compete.

2557
03:00:20,260 --> 03:00:21,580
I'll win so hard.

2558
03:00:22,040 --> 03:00:23,860
We'll bankrupt every bookie in Torrance.

2559
03:00:23,880 --> 03:00:24,560
Bro, let's do it.

2560
03:00:24,840 --> 03:00:25,560
You're so right.

2561
03:00:25,920 --> 03:00:26,820
Don't worry, give me a sec.

2562
03:00:27,660 --> 03:00:28,940
Now we're fighting in this.

2563
03:00:29,900 --> 03:00:30,320
Wait, what?

2564
03:00:30,520 --> 03:00:31,080
You're a training.

2565
03:00:32,040 --> 03:00:32,860
Well, officially.

2566
03:00:33,400 --> 03:00:33,760
Legally.

2567
03:00:34,380 --> 03:00:36,580
Your flight-capable heroes need a flight license.

2568
03:00:37,080 --> 03:00:37,780
That's fine.

2569
03:00:38,280 --> 03:00:39,260
Go to a fly school.

2570
03:00:42,040 --> 03:00:43,780
No, we don't need to use coffee yet.

2571
03:00:43,940 --> 03:00:44,700
See, I told you.

2573
03:01:19,540 --> 03:01:21,420
Prepare to protect the subscribe.

2574
03:01:21,520 --> 03:01:22,280
Wait, who did I do?

2575
03:01:22,680 --> 03:01:23,280
Cav for that?

2576
03:01:24,100 --> 03:01:25,180
These two, right?

2577
03:01:25,660 --> 03:01:25,860
Yeah.

2578
03:01:26,340 --> 03:01:27,480
Fucking rocks.

2579
03:01:28,580 --> 03:01:29,840
Using your symbols on your corner.

2580
03:01:30,120 --> 03:01:31,960
Or maybe a coup help, punch up.

2581
03:01:32,660 --> 03:01:34,060
All right, yeah, help him out.

2582
03:01:35,200 --> 03:01:36,100
Fuck it, let's go.

2583
03:01:38,000 --> 03:01:38,460
25.

2584
03:01:39,000 --> 03:01:39,520
Uh, what?

2585
03:01:39,680 --> 03:01:41,740
This is our 25th time being paired together.

2586
03:01:42,440 --> 03:01:43,000
Let's go.

2587
03:01:43,580 --> 03:01:44,400
I am.

2588
03:01:44,800 --> 03:01:47,520
And then, with me there, welcome to Lindsay's Center.

2589
03:01:48,020 --> 03:01:49,280
Get in the air with the bone zone.

2590
03:01:49,760 --> 03:01:50,900
Participate in a friendly debate.

2591
03:01:50,960 --> 03:01:51,660
I know who it is.

2592
03:01:51,680 --> 03:01:52,380
It's on my radar.

2593
03:01:53,560 --> 03:01:54,060
Look at.

2594
03:01:54,400 --> 03:01:55,320
These two like each other.

2595
03:01:55,440 --> 03:01:55,780
Oh, my God.

2596
03:01:55,800 --> 03:01:56,040
These two.

2597
03:01:56,040 --> 03:01:56,540
I always forget.

2598
03:01:56,700 --> 03:01:58,100
I've got better things to do anyway.

2599
03:01:59,040 --> 03:01:59,840
Want to dance?

2600
03:02:01,520 --> 03:02:02,880
They're okay with each other, right?

2601
03:02:04,800 --> 03:02:05,980
I think they are.

2602
03:02:06,880 --> 03:02:08,060
Oh, Sonar and Mel.

2603
03:02:08,880 --> 03:02:09,820
Oh, that's fine.

2604
03:02:09,840 --> 03:02:10,600
Right back at you.

2605
03:02:10,620 --> 03:02:10,920
There you go.

2606
03:02:12,320 --> 03:02:14,040
I keep forgetting who they're friends with.

2607
03:02:17,540 --> 03:02:17,980
Oh?

2608
03:02:20,060 --> 03:02:20,500
Sorry.

2609
03:02:23,660 --> 03:02:26,500
Don't worry, we got Invisagirl here.

2610
03:02:27,520 --> 03:02:29,200
Fuckers didn't even see me coming.

2611
03:02:31,080 --> 03:02:32,120
Oh, the sabotage is over?

2612
03:02:32,280 --> 03:02:33,240
Does it happen again?

2613
03:02:33,280 --> 03:02:35,460
Do they ever sabotage again?

2614
03:02:35,580 --> 03:02:37,580
Your position at the top of the leaderboard.

2615
03:02:38,420 --> 03:02:39,240
Don't be jealous.

2616
03:02:39,660 --> 03:02:41,080
I took a little peek at your file.

2617
03:02:41,700 --> 03:02:44,320
Apparently you've got more fire than anyone else on the team.

2618
03:02:44,660 --> 03:02:45,660
I'm like a psychic man.

2619
03:02:46,160 --> 03:02:48,820
I can sense where they're going to be before they happen.

2620
03:02:49,340 --> 03:02:53,020
Listen, listen, there's a lot of potential here for a good health insurance scheme.

2621
03:02:53,200 --> 03:02:53,380
Wait.

2622
03:02:53,480 --> 03:02:54,460
You just need a middleman.

2623
03:02:54,920 --> 03:02:56,000
I could be your guy.

2624
03:02:56,520 --> 03:02:56,960
Interesting.

2625
03:02:57,240 --> 03:02:57,800
We did it.

2626
03:02:57,820 --> 03:02:58,660
We won Fight Club.

2627
03:02:59,180 --> 03:02:59,800
Let's go.

2628
03:03:00,140 --> 03:03:01,740
We got bonus checks.

2629
03:03:02,140 --> 03:03:03,140
Hold up.

2630
03:03:03,340 --> 03:03:04,260
Hold the fuck up.

2631
03:03:04,740 --> 03:03:04,760
Punch.

2632
03:03:04,960 --> 03:03:05,460

2633
03:03:05,580 --> 03:03:06,520
Look at that, guys.

03:03:48,240 --> 03:03:48,740
He hits hard.

2642
03:03:48,880 --> 03:03:51,320
Okay, we need to figure this out.

2643
03:03:54,420 --> 03:03:55,760
Oh, it gives new abilities?

2644
03:03:56,540 --> 03:03:56,580
Oh!

2645
03:03:58,500 --> 03:03:59,360
I see.

2646
03:04:00,920 --> 03:04:04,060
Half man, half bat, all freak.

2647
03:04:05,780 --> 03:04:06,980
Wait, who has new upgrades?

2648
03:04:07,440 --> 03:04:07,820
Oh, wait.

2649
03:04:08,180 --> 03:04:10,800
We'll grab more combat because you are a fighter.

2650
03:04:13,760 --> 03:04:14,860
Oh, God, there's a lot.

2651
03:04:15,020 --> 03:04:15,340
Help!

2652
03:04:15,560 --> 03:04:16,140
I am at the door.

2653
03:04:16,160 --> 03:04:18,900
Oh, it's back and there's these guys with masks and guns.

2654
03:04:20,400 --> 03:04:20,960
Oh, God.

2655
03:04:21,400 --> 03:04:21,880
Oh, God.

2656
03:04:26,950 --> 03:04:28,510
We'll use Prism, right?

2657
03:04:28,830 --> 03:04:29,790
Uh, I don't know.

2658
03:04:29,990 --> 03:04:31,490
I want to...

2659
03:04:32,610 --> 03:04:34,090
We'll give you some stuff.

2660
03:04:36,090 --> 03:04:36,590
Um...

2661
03:04:37,770 --> 03:04:40,070
Oh, everyone is not...

2662
03:04:40,070 --> 03:04:41,150
Oh, okay.

2663
03:04:41,230 --> 03:04:44,610
We're going to have to put some coffee for someone.

2664
03:04:48,680 --> 03:04:49,940
Why can't I use this?

2665
03:04:50,340 --> 03:04:51,280
Oh, Shadini!

2666
03:04:53,660 --> 03:04:54,700
Okay, whatever.

2667
03:04:57,380 --> 03:04:58,620
Oh, no.

2668
03:05:02,820 --> 03:05:03,600
It's okay.

2669
03:05:03,720 --> 03:05:05,140
I still have time.

2670
03:05:12,280 --> 03:05:13,520
Oh, okay.

2671
03:05:14,580 --> 03:05:15,860
No, no way I'm doing that.

2672
03:05:16,080 --> 03:05:16,400
What?

2673
03:05:19,040 --> 03:05:19,560
What?

2674
03:05:21,540 --> 03:05:22,620
On my way.

2675
03:05:23,260 --> 03:05:23,320
Oh.

2676
03:05:23,340 --> 03:05:24,120
Are you see...

2677
03:05:24,120 --> 03:05:24,480
Okay.

2678
03:05:36,610 --> 03:05:37,450
I think you can do it.

2679
03:05:37,510 --> 03:05:38,230
Brace yourselves.

2680
03:05:38,450 --> 03:05:39,410
I think you can do it.

2681
03:05:39,630 --> 03:05:40,830
I don't think he needs anyone.

2682
03:05:41,430 --> 03:05:41,650
All right.

2683
03:05:42,110 --> 03:05:43,470
I don't see gender.

2684
03:05:43,890 --> 03:05:45,250
Oh, you're just gonna get cut.

2685
03:05:45,350 --> 03:05:45,550
Fuck it.

2686
03:05:45,630 --> 03:05:46,310
I'm cutting you.

2687
03:05:47,910 --> 03:05:49,190
Oh, fuck.

2688
03:06:01,460 --> 03:06:02,780
Oh, this is bad.

2689
03:06:02,820 --> 03:06:04,560
I already tangled with this dickwad once.

2690
03:06:04,880 --> 03:06:05,740
Send someone else.

2691
03:06:07,140 --> 03:06:07,480
All right.

2692
03:06:07,580 --> 03:06:08,220
This is five.

2693
03:06:08,680 --> 03:06:09,060
It's Thundercock.

2694
03:06:11,600 --> 03:06:11,900
All right.

2695
03:06:11,980 --> 03:06:12,720
Trap the robbers.

2696
03:06:12,820 --> 03:06:13,220
It's okay.

2697
03:06:13,640 --> 03:06:14,480
We got...

2698
03:06:14,700 --> 03:06:15,520
Good luck, golem.

2699
03:06:15,940 --> 03:06:17,240
You can solo this.

2700
03:06:17,680 --> 03:06:18,640
Golem, sweet.

2701
03:06:20,920 --> 03:06:21,760
I believe.

2702
03:06:23,520 --> 03:06:24,620
It's a golem, sweet.

2703
03:06:37,980 --> 03:06:38,360
There you go.

2704
03:06:39,140 --> 03:06:39,900
Oh, that is...

2705
03:06:39,900 --> 03:06:41,700
Oh, now I get why you guys said it gets harder.

2706
03:06:42,240 --> 03:06:43,160
That is weirdo.

2707
03:07:02,500 --> 03:07:02,980
Oh, my God.

2708
03:07:03,060 --> 03:07:03,520
I don't remember.

2709
03:07:09,040 --> 03:07:09,680
Oh, my God.

2710
03:07:24,720 --> 03:07:25,700
Well, it's the last one.

2711
03:07:25,720 --> 03:07:27,540
What is the last one?

2712
03:07:27,820 --> 03:07:28,620
Guys, no!

2713
03:07:32,620 --> 03:07:36,340
Guys, what was...

2714
03:07:36,340 --> 03:07:37,200
Oh my god.

2715
03:07:39,660 --> 03:07:40,780
Okay, okay, okay, okay, we got this.

2716
03:07:40,880 --> 03:07:41,140
We got it.

2717
03:07:42,880 --> 03:07:43,500
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

2718
03:07:43,520 --> 03:07:43,980
We got it.

2719
03:07:44,080 --> 03:07:44,440
We got it.

2720
03:07:44,660 --> 03:07:44,920
We got it.

2721
03:07:48,460 --> 03:07:48,900
Yay!

2722
03:07:50,000 --> 03:07:53,040
We're a team, everyone.

2723
03:07:54,520 --> 03:07:54,960
Yay!

2724
03:07:56,220 --> 03:07:57,380
This is a team.

2725
03:07:58,100 --> 03:07:58,620
game.

2726
03:08:00,280 --> 03:08:00,800
Yappy!

2727
03:08:05,300 --> 03:08:07,980
I believe he can solo this.

2728
03:08:09,640 --> 03:08:12,260
This is... I still believe.

2729
03:08:15,180 --> 03:08:18,660
My car is about to the prism creates an illusion that keeps for a few more.

2730
03:08:18,780 --> 03:08:19,460
This happens.

2731
03:08:20,600 --> 03:08:23,120
Prisms now have the full stats of the copy.

2732
03:08:23,160 --> 03:08:24,020
Oh, I like that.

2733
03:08:27,020 --> 03:08:29,760
I I think he can solo this.

2734
03:08:30,320 --> 03:08:32,320
My man, Golems, got it.

2735
03:08:33,460 --> 03:08:34,460
Okay, Golems.

2736
03:08:39,820 --> 03:08:40,820
Oh, man.

2737
03:08:43,000 --> 03:08:44,000
Oh, man.

2738
03:08:44,960 --> 03:08:46,580
Oh, I can't redo on that one.

2739
03:08:46,840 --> 03:08:47,380
It's okay.

2740
03:08:47,620 --> 03:08:48,460
It's all right.

2741
03:08:48,640 --> 03:08:49,960
Pretty breathtaking work back there.

2742
03:08:50,160 --> 03:08:50,920
Not too shabby.

2743
03:08:51,120 --> 03:08:53,280
You know, it's not our fault.

2744
03:08:54,240 --> 03:08:55,100
It's like we're working.

2745
03:08:55,660 --> 03:08:56,880
Four failures?

2746
03:08:57,560 --> 03:08:58,180
As a theme.

2747
03:08:58,700 --> 03:08:59,040
Uh-huh.

2748
03:08:59,580 --> 03:09:00,640
Baby, that's got a name.

2749
03:09:00,660 --> 03:09:01,520
What did I get?

2750
03:09:02,800 --> 03:09:04,120
Isn't that like a sex thing?

2751
03:09:04,460 --> 03:09:06,140
What type of sex thing would that be?

2752
03:09:06,440 --> 03:09:07,800
It's not really a sexual...

2753
03:09:07,800 --> 03:09:08,080
It's her fault.

2754
03:09:08,440 --> 03:09:08,680
You know.

2755
03:09:09,360 --> 03:09:10,240
I'll text it to you.

2756
03:09:10,480 --> 03:09:10,980
All right, nice.

2757
03:09:11,840 --> 03:09:12,540
Oh, damn, boy.

2758
03:09:12,760 --> 03:09:14,280
That's some fucking teamwork.

2759
03:09:14,680 --> 03:09:15,020
All right.

2760
03:09:15,560 --> 03:09:15,860
Yeah.

2761
03:09:16,060 --> 03:09:16,820
Let's give him word.

2762
03:09:22,790 --> 03:09:23,810
Invisigaw, where are you going?

2763
03:09:24,010 --> 03:09:24,690
It's not my fault.

2764
03:09:31,020 --> 03:09:32,080
What's going on?

2765
03:09:32,320 --> 03:09:33,200
Is she depressed?

2766
03:09:33,380 --> 03:09:34,780
Because I'm going to keep fire her?

2767
03:09:39,010 --> 03:09:40,370
Smoking in a playground.

2768
03:09:40,910 --> 03:09:41,990
What the fuck's wrong with you?

2769
03:09:42,110 --> 03:09:42,690
There you go.

2770
03:09:42,950 --> 03:09:44,290
One more strike against me.

2771
03:09:44,670 --> 03:09:45,930
You gotta get rid of somebody, right?

2772
03:09:46,290 --> 03:09:47,830
I'm making it easy for you.

2773
03:09:48,770 --> 03:09:49,250
You're quitting.

2774
03:09:49,710 --> 03:09:51,230
You're not making it easy for me.

2775
03:09:51,470 --> 03:09:53,110
Yeah, why is she smoking with asthma?

2776
03:09:55,270 --> 03:09:56,390
You don't get it.

2777
03:09:56,870 --> 03:09:58,790
Some people are born to be heroes.

2778
03:09:59,410 --> 03:10:00,130
I'm not one of them.

2779
03:10:01,090 --> 03:10:01,490
I tried.

2780
03:10:01,830 --> 03:10:02,770
Just wasn't meant to be.

2781
03:10:03,070 --> 03:10:03,610
Meant to be.

2782
03:10:03,750 --> 03:10:05,630
You didn't even try that hard!

2783
03:10:08,530 --> 03:10:10,130
Oh, you didn't even try that hard.

2784
03:10:11,230 --> 03:10:12,550
Flying through the sky.

2785
03:10:13,090 --> 03:10:13,930
Nothing to hide.

2786
03:10:14,030 --> 03:10:14,590
What's your point?

2787
03:10:14,790 --> 03:10:16,150
Yeah, that was a freaky conversation.

2788
03:10:16,830 --> 03:10:18,710
I have fucking villain powers.

2789
03:10:19,430 --> 03:10:22,290
I can turn invisible and skulk in the shadows.

2790
03:10:22,590 --> 03:10:23,650
Yeah, but you can give intel.

2791
03:10:24,070 --> 03:10:25,250
And watch famous people fuck.

2792
03:10:25,690 --> 03:10:26,750
Yeah, villain is my fate.

2793
03:10:26,830 --> 03:10:27,290
I watch.

2794
03:10:27,410 --> 03:10:28,270
You can just film it.

2795
03:10:28,390 --> 03:10:29,330
It's in the fucking stars.

2796
03:10:29,490 --> 03:10:30,310
And then sell it.

2797
03:10:30,410 --> 03:10:34,350
You know... In the same way that blonde blazer was always meant to be a hero.

2798
03:10:34,790 --> 03:10:36,170
It is bullshit.

2799
03:10:36,610 --> 03:10:37,190
It's bullshit.

2800
03:10:37,810 --> 03:10:40,890
It's just something we cling to because we think we're the main...

2801
03:10:41,690 --> 03:10:43,110
Oh, I shouldn't have said that.

2802
03:10:43,730 --> 03:10:47,170
Or a bunch of flesh blobs with depression on a floating rock.

2803
03:10:48,250 --> 03:10:50,230
Is that supposed to be comforting?

2804
03:10:50,750 --> 03:10:54,370
Yeah, because no one's paying attention if you want to switch things up.

2805
03:10:56,450 --> 03:10:57,930
You've already been a hero, okay?

2806
03:10:58,190 --> 03:10:59,930
You have no idea what I'm dealing with.

2807
03:11:00,190 --> 03:11:01,130
Oh, get out of here.

2808
03:11:01,450 --> 03:11:02,910
At least you were born with powers.

2809
03:11:03,110 --> 03:11:03,890
I don't have shit.

2810
03:11:04,290 --> 03:11:07,310
So according to your dumbass theory, I should be an accountant.

2811
03:11:09,670 --> 03:11:10,810
You aren't far off.

2812
03:11:10,910 --> 03:11:37,190
fate destiny not having power she's into it guys me talking down on her being a hero before and they won't keep me from what's that weird where you compliments you insult them and then compliment them being a hero again it's working on her i'm in oh it's him again i got you want to talk about fate that lightning struck that's been on a spree is two blocks from your location maybe it's Yeah,

2813
03:11:37,290 --> 03:11:38,690
I'm doing backhanded compliment.

2814
03:11:39,290 --> 03:11:39,750
I'm out.

2815
03:11:40,770 --> 03:11:41,150
Oh, yeah, I'm nagging.

2816
03:11:43,410 --> 03:11:45,390
What makes you think it'd be any different?

2817
03:11:46,290 --> 03:11:46,790
You're pissed.

2818
03:11:47,030 --> 03:11:47,470
I get it.

2819
03:11:47,650 --> 03:11:49,090
You know what I like to do when I'm pissed?

2820
03:11:49,290 --> 03:11:49,890
Punch things.

2821
03:11:50,350 --> 03:11:51,350
Often, bad people.

2822
03:11:51,910 --> 03:11:53,530
I do like to punch things.

2823
03:11:54,070 --> 03:11:54,490
I know.

2824
03:11:54,690 --> 03:11:55,570
You're great at it.

2825
03:11:56,110 --> 03:11:57,510
Go be great one more time.

2826
03:11:57,570 --> 03:11:57,690
Yeah.

2827
03:11:58,210 --> 03:12:00,170
And if you kill him, that's a bonus.

2828
03:12:00,310 --> 03:12:01,690
One less criminal on the road.

2829
03:12:10,910 --> 03:12:11,870
Don't do it.

2830
03:12:13,270 --> 03:13:08,130
that kid a cigarette what's the address shut the fuck up okay sorry i know it's like my immersion but that reminded me i was like walking down the street one time and i think it was i think it was valentine's day i think and i was walking down the street to buy some buy some stuff for dad and i think i forgot to tell you guys the story but this kid like walked up to me and was like can you buy me alcohol for like my girlfriend and i for that like he was holding like a he was holding like i didn't give a child so he was holding like uh like like a like a bunch of flowers like bouquet of flowers and this kid went up to me and was like can you buy us buy me alcohol for me and my girlfriend for valentine's day i

2831
03:13:11,320 --> 03:13:24,000
don't know how old he was like i'll pay you I'll pay you back but like like I'll give you like I'll give you like double the money you can buy me it for he

2832
03:13:29,690 --> 03:14:14,770
said no but that's what it reminded me of like I said no I didn't want to get arrested like bro we were like it was day it was day outside like I'm probably not gonna fight give this kid I don't know how old he is like I would if I said yes I would have not this story on stream because that's me admitting to a crime live on stream like of course i didn't fucking do it why the would i admit it on stream if i did but that's just what that's what it provided me of yeah i

2833
03:14:19,590 --> 03:14:26,970
don't know how old he is like he like i know he was underage Not underage, but you have to be...

2834
03:14:26,970 --> 03:14:28,810
Yeah, yeah, because in Canada, it's 18.

2835
03:14:30,590 --> 03:14:37,970
So he was definitely underage, so if he's asking me to buy him alcohol, I don't remember that.

2836
03:14:37,970 --> 03:14:38,750
Where's your boy?

2837
03:14:40,090 --> 03:14:40,570
Shit.

2838
03:14:41,670 --> 03:14:44,290
He's like, in America, it's 21, but in Canada it's 18.

2839
03:14:44,990 --> 03:14:46,730
So I was like, that's worse, you know?

2840
03:14:50,090 --> 03:14:50,570
You...

2841
03:14:50,570 --> 03:14:51,690
Donut, girl.

2842
03:14:52,230 --> 03:14:54,350
You sure you want to do this again?

2843
03:14:57,470 --> 03:14:58,890
He wasn't even gonna pay you.

2844
03:14:58,930 --> 03:15:00,370
No, he was gonna give me money first.

2845
03:15:00,470 --> 03:15:02,290
I mean, I could have just taken the money and just left.

2846
03:15:06,110 --> 03:15:06,430
But...

2847
03:15:08,530 --> 03:15:09,250
I'm flying blind here.

2848
03:15:09,250 --> 03:15:10,550
I can't see anything.

2849
03:15:10,810 --> 03:15:11,130
What's going on?

2850
03:15:11,130 --> 03:15:11,310
Great.

2851
03:15:11,310 --> 03:15:13,150
Give me a second to tap into this.

2852
03:15:25,830 --> 03:15:27,390
Oh shit, the hack again.

2853
03:15:27,670 --> 03:15:29,090
Oh, it's not time though this time.

2854
03:15:34,740 --> 03:15:35,360
Thank god.

2855
03:15:35,540 --> 03:15:36,740
I'm laughing out of stress.

2856
03:15:37,000 --> 03:15:37,940
A little more tricky.

2857
03:15:38,440 --> 03:15:39,820
Sure, take your time.

2858
03:15:40,260 --> 03:15:40,340
What?

2859
03:15:40,920 --> 03:15:41,700
I need quiet.

2860
03:15:42,460 --> 03:15:42,820
Oh!

2861
03:15:43,620 --> 03:15:45,260
I was like so confused.

2862
03:15:45,460 --> 03:15:46,340
I was like, what is that?

2863
03:15:46,420 --> 03:15:48,300
There was not enough time for me to...

2864
03:15:48,300 --> 03:15:48,840
What is it?

2865
03:15:49,000 --> 03:15:49,520
Antivirus.

2866
03:15:50,440 --> 03:15:51,200
There you are.

2867
03:15:53,680 --> 03:15:56,000
Okay, now there's antivirus too.

2868
03:15:57,200 --> 03:15:57,720
Okay.

2869
03:15:59,600 --> 03:16:00,220
Got it.

2870
03:16:00,420 --> 03:16:01,180
I can see you again.

2871
03:16:01,180 --> 03:16:02,260
That makes one of us...

2872
03:16:02,260 --> 03:16:03,700
Four minute crime on stream, press...

2873
03:16:03,700 --> 03:16:05,980
By the way, there's something she's not telling us.

2874
03:16:06,240 --> 03:16:07,460
God, thank you for the super chat.

2875
03:16:07,660 --> 03:16:07,780
Thank you.

2876
03:16:07,940 --> 03:16:09,000
Thank you.

2877
03:16:09,000 --> 03:16:10,420
Ruchi, thank you for the super chat.

2878
03:16:10,480 --> 03:16:10,720
Thank you.

2879
03:16:10,960 --> 03:16:12,100
Thank you.

2880
03:16:14,000 --> 03:16:15,520
Okay, now we gotta be smart.

2881
03:16:17,000 --> 03:16:17,400
Okay.

2882
03:16:22,160 --> 03:16:24,080
I guess I could do this too.

2883
03:16:26,940 --> 03:16:27,820
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

2884
03:16:29,340 --> 03:16:30,780
Oh, I'm fucked.

2885
03:16:32,760 --> 03:16:33,760
Okay, nice.

2886
03:16:35,300 --> 03:16:36,340
JK, I'm gaming.

2887
03:16:38,220 --> 03:16:39,560
JK, I'm still gaming.

2888
03:16:40,680 --> 03:16:41,500
Ignoring what I...

2889
03:16:41,500 --> 03:16:43,140
Ignoring me fucking that up.

2890
03:16:46,700 --> 03:16:47,700
He's at your seven.

2891
03:16:49,100 --> 03:16:50,740
That wasn't so hard, was it?

2892
03:16:51,000 --> 03:16:51,940
He's heading your way.

2893
03:17:01,070 --> 03:17:01,850
Master your life.

2894
03:17:01,950 --> 03:17:02,870
And this is the guy I got a plan.

2895
03:17:05,630 --> 03:17:06,430
Oh, shit.

2896
03:17:07,210 --> 03:17:10,370
Oh, I can only be caught once, I guess.

2897
03:17:11,830 --> 03:17:12,390
Oh, what?

2898
03:17:16,750 --> 03:17:17,190
Okay.

2899
03:17:17,590 --> 03:17:19,650
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.

2900
03:17:20,030 --> 03:17:20,690
Okay, nice.

2901
03:17:26,130 --> 03:17:26,950
Oh, my God.

2902
03:17:27,870 --> 03:17:28,330
There we go.

2903
03:17:29,130 --> 03:17:30,890
I gotta use my brain for that.

2904
03:17:32,030 --> 03:17:32,770
I looped him.

2905
03:17:32,930 --> 03:17:33,410
Looped a loop.

2906
03:17:33,830 --> 03:17:39,950
On the count of three, I'm going to turn on the main overhead lights, which should temporarily blind him giving you a chance to take him out.

2907
03:17:43,190 --> 03:17:47,210
One, two, three.

2908
03:17:49,930 --> 03:17:52,050
See, I saved our life now she'll remember this.

2909
03:17:54,230 --> 03:17:54,730
Oh shit.

2910
03:17:56,510 --> 03:17:57,230
Choke him!

2911
03:17:57,450 --> 03:17:57,770
Yeah!

2912
03:17:59,510 --> 03:18:00,370
Got this!

2913
03:18:01,350 --> 03:18:02,510
Break his neck!

2914
03:18:09,080 --> 03:18:10,480
I'm no hero.

2915
03:18:11,220 --> 03:18:12,600
Fuck, no, let me try that again.

2916
03:18:14,480 --> 03:18:16,720
Wait, uh, what about...

2917
03:18:16,720 --> 03:18:18,040
Move, let me retry this.

2918
03:18:20,340 --> 03:18:20,820
Nice.

2919
03:18:22,440 --> 03:18:23,320
That's the one.

2920
03:18:23,760 --> 03:18:25,760
Would have been better if you said it first.

2921
03:18:25,920 --> 03:18:27,700
Right, just lightning thunder.

2922
03:18:27,700 --> 03:18:28,440
Just cut it.

2923
03:18:29,320 --> 03:18:30,600
Just edit it out.

2924
03:18:30,900 --> 03:18:32,460
Like how Mr. Beast edited his teeth.

2925
03:18:34,400 --> 03:18:34,960
You guys know that?

2926
03:18:35,020 --> 03:18:35,720
That's crazy.

2927
03:18:35,940 --> 03:18:36,560
What is it called?

2928
03:18:36,820 --> 03:18:37,300
Teeth gate?

2929
03:18:38,140 --> 03:18:39,540
Hey, bangle boy!

2930
03:18:40,360 --> 03:18:41,640
More like bangle bitch!

2931
03:18:41,920 --> 03:18:42,880
Or bitch boy!

2932
03:18:43,060 --> 03:18:44,260
Hey bangle bitch boy, fuck you!

2933
03:18:44,560 --> 03:18:46,860
Yeah, catchphrases aren't easy, guys.

2934
03:18:46,980 --> 03:18:48,980
It takes a while to build your catchphrase.

2935
03:18:50,260 --> 03:18:52,140
Why are those assholes not being assholes?

2936
03:18:53,940 --> 03:18:55,260
Isn't this what you were going for?

2937
03:18:55,500 --> 03:18:56,520
Yeah, they're a team.

2938
03:18:57,200 --> 03:18:58,460
They're cheering for their teammates.

2939
03:18:59,360 --> 03:19:02,920
So this one keeps the comm line one-on-one.

2940
03:19:03,800 --> 03:19:05,760
This one connects to the whole team.

2941
03:19:06,240 --> 03:19:09,760
And this one goes out to the entire brain.

2942
03:19:10,620 --> 03:19:10,960
Oh!

2943
03:19:12,240 --> 03:19:13,120
Good job.

2944
03:19:13,320 --> 03:19:14,380
Yeah, you got off light.

2945
03:19:14,560 --> 03:20:21,860
one dispatcher broadcast the details of his botched circumcision hr nightmare wait but nobody stopped me you really think she has a shot nobody went up to me sounded good but everyone has a shot no if you were just saying what you thought she needed to hear see i'm i'm nagging everyone has a shot people are who they choose to be if invisigal wants this she has to commit it's too easy to quit when you're not good at something now i just got compliment golem next and now he and now they're like deeply indebted to me hot and cold guys that was great this mission was textbook genuinely dude i'm really happy for you so it's between sonar and coop what sonar cool and visigal still at the bottom of the board oh the one in the bullpen that thing updates every hour and visigal moved up catching lightning struck really gave her a huge boost bangle boy real really the donut shop escape slipping past a malevola now the jewelry store really bumped up the wanted levels it's like missing the free

2946
03:20:21,860 --> 03:21:37,580

2947
03:21:48,050 --> 03:21:51,230
Hoop, I'm sure you already know why I've asked you here.

2948
03:21:51,730 --> 03:21:52,570
You would be mistaken.

2949
03:21:53,090 --> 03:21:54,050
Oh, okay.

2950
03:21:54,570 --> 03:21:57,730
Um, well, I'm letting you go.

2951
03:21:58,350 --> 03:21:59,770
You're at the bottom of the leaderboards.

2952
03:21:59,930 --> 03:22:04,590
I guess all those penalties for, you know, cutting people, added up.

2953
03:22:05,110 --> 03:22:05,490
I'm sorry.

2954
03:22:05,670 --> 03:22:08,250
But I cheered for Invisagal.

2955
03:22:08,710 --> 03:22:09,110
You did.

2956
03:22:09,190 --> 03:22:09,670
I saw that.

2957
03:22:09,670 --> 03:22:10,450
We all cheered.

2958
03:22:10,710 --> 03:22:12,970
I only did that because I thought she was being cut.

2959
03:22:13,190 --> 03:22:13,490
Whoa.

2960
03:22:13,710 --> 03:22:14,890
That makes sense.

2961
03:22:15,150 --> 03:22:16,290
A lot of sense, actually.

2962
03:22:16,850 --> 03:22:20,030
Yeah, well, she snuck past her with her last dispatch.

2963
03:22:21,410 --> 03:22:21,550
Oh.

2964
03:22:23,430 --> 03:22:24,630
That's, uh...

2965
03:22:24,630 --> 03:22:25,390
Oh, look at that.

2966
03:22:25,630 --> 03:22:26,790
That's very menacing.

2967
03:22:27,390 --> 03:22:28,570
Well, thank you.

2968
03:22:29,650 --> 03:22:30,290
Oh, shit.

2969
03:22:35,530 --> 03:22:35,930
It's okay.

2970
03:22:36,050 --> 03:22:38,470
Maybe there are other superhero agencies out there.

2971
03:22:40,710 --> 03:22:41,270
You know?

2972
03:22:42,410 --> 03:22:45,390
Maybe there's other agencies that she can sign up for.

2973
03:22:46,050 --> 03:22:47,470
It can't be only one.

2974
03:22:48,070 --> 03:22:48,410
Right?

2975
03:22:49,210 --> 03:22:52,730
I just keep that.

2976
03:22:53,930 --> 03:22:54,890
You accessorizing?

2977
03:22:55,670 --> 03:22:56,510
You could call it that.

2978
03:22:57,310 --> 03:22:58,290
Where'd you get that?

2979
03:22:59,090 --> 03:22:59,390
Coop.

2980
03:23:00,190 --> 03:23:04,730
It's not bad to fire a heart ex-accessant, right?

2981
03:23:07,030 --> 03:23:08,110
One is just the bat.

2982
03:23:08,290 --> 03:23:10,930
The other one was an ex-accessant.

2983
03:23:11,070 --> 03:23:13,290
So I don't know if I made the right choice, guys.

2984
03:23:13,810 --> 03:23:15,170
You're spoiling him.

2985
03:23:15,170 --> 03:23:16,030
Not safe.

2986
03:23:16,150 --> 03:23:16,750
Talk about it.

2987

You ready to go home, bud?

2988
03:23:19,130 --> 03:23:24,430
Oh, nothing bad will come out of this, I'm pretty sure.

2989
03:23:29,350 --> 03:23:30,890
Who's the bottom now?

2990
03:23:31,210 --> 03:23:31,490
Oh.

03:23:34,070 --> 03:23:35,050

03:23:39,470 --> 03:23:40,670
Oh, she's third last.

3002
03:24:26,960 --> 03:24:28,960
Her being last is sort of, like, her fault, though.

3003
03:24:29,000 --> 03:24:30,960
Because she was self-sabotaging herself, so.

3004
03:24:33,100 --> 03:24:33,540
UN64.

3005
03:24:33,700 --> 03:24:35,140
Yeah, no one cuts Charlie.

3006
03:24:37,540 --> 03:24:38,160
Oh, this.

3015
03:24:55,060 --> 03:24:55,500
Wait.

3016
03:24:55,960 --> 03:24:56,940
Oh, if you don't have...

03:24:56,960 --> 03:24:59,260

3018
03:25:04,230 --> 03:25:04,670
Wait.

You and a player said fate is bullshit.

3023
03:25:23,890 --> 03:25:25,410
Oh, but that was a good choice, though.

3024
03:25:26,010 --> 03:25:27,210
I said a good thing.

3025
03:25:28,150 --> 03:25:37,490

03:28:02,200 --> 03:28:06,520
This is why the game is popular Psycho.

3049
03:28:06,660 --> 03:28:07,720
Thank you for the super chat.

3050
03:28:07,940 --> 03:28:08,040
Thank you.

Thank you.

3052
03:28:08,860 --> 03:28:10,200
I don't remember guys.

3053
03:28:10,640 --> 03:28:11,770
We get all of this

3054
03:28:15,660 --> 03:28:17,540
What the fuck?

3055
03:28:19,980 --> 03:28:24,860
Guys we get all of all It's a sensor.

3056
03:28:24,980 --> 03:28:29,680
I don't know why it's sensor Oh my god.

3057
03:28:29,760 --> 03:28:34,300
We get all of that, but yet the models aren't public.

3058
03:28:34,880 --> 03:28:36,080
They hit the models.

3059
03:28:39,780 --> 03:28:40,640
Koop was a friend of his.

3060
03:28:41,220 --> 03:28:41,740
They used to date.

3061
03:28:42,920 --> 03:28:43,060
Oh.

3062
03:28:43,340 --> 03:28:44,920
My last girlfriend was taller than me.

3063
03:28:44,980 --> 03:28:46,420
She used to kiss me on my forehead a lot.

3064
03:28:46,600 --> 03:28:47,080
It was nice.

3065
03:28:47,960 --> 03:28:48,880
What are we talking about?

3066
03:28:49,440 --> 03:28:50,260
Oh, right.

3067
03:28:50,800 --> 03:28:51,300
Oh, poor dad.

3068
03:28:52,260 --> 03:28:56,940
The problem with only cutting one of them is now you gotta deal with their pissy friends poisoning the rest of the team.

3069
03:28:57,780 --> 03:28:58,940
Come on, Chase.

3070
03:28:59,140 --> 03:28:59,800
It's harmless.

3071
03:29:00,500 --> 03:29:01,900
Who doesn't love an office prank?

3072
03:29:02,100 --> 03:29:02,720
Me, motherfucker.

3073
03:29:03,040 --> 03:29:03,880
Don't even think about it.

3074
03:29:04,000 --> 03:29:05,220
That's why I would have cut them all.

3075
03:29:05,380 --> 03:29:06,420
Start them with that asshole.

3076
03:29:07,900 --> 03:29:08,620
Which one?

3077
03:29:09,040 --> 03:29:10,240
Invisible gal, but she...

3078
03:29:10,240 --> 03:29:10,780
Why is she staring at you?

3079
03:29:11,260 --> 03:29:13,340
She had a horny dream of me.

3080
03:29:13,820 --> 03:29:15,440
Don't you got some dementia to onset?

3081
03:29:16,360 --> 03:29:18,200
That's why the models are locked.

3082
03:29:18,440 --> 03:29:22,100
Bro, you can't lock the models if you're part of the problem.

3083
03:29:23,020 --> 03:29:23,980
You can't lock the model if you're part of the problem.

3084
03:29:24,820 --> 03:29:26,380
You should think about who you want.

3085
03:29:27,660 --> 03:29:55,540
tell what if the one who animated that was uh what am i missing was animating some stuff on what's it called the overwatch models they want to be the only supplier he looks rough oh oh god god god damn it water boy sorry yeah you can tell whoever animated that was an sfm a animator.

3086
03:29:58,160 --> 03:30:01,720
They regret it not adding more scenes like that.

3087
03:30:01,920 --> 03:30:04,040
Thank you, thank you.

3088
03:30:05,500 --> 03:30:08,800
Good thing, because it's the only reason anyone gave your sorry ass a job.

3089
03:30:10,480 --> 03:30:11,900
Water boy used...

3090
03:30:11,900 --> 03:30:13,680
To be fair, water gun is basically that.

3091
03:30:14,080 --> 03:30:15,220
It's... Jesus.

3092
03:30:17,760 --> 03:30:18,520
Yeah, I understand.

3093
03:30:25,740 --> 03:30:26,820

3098
03:31:26,410 --> 03:31:28,890
Frap, can't even pass the E class.

3099
03:31:34,930 --> 03:31:37,830
Protopulse test seven, failure.

03:31:38,190 --> 03:31:40,010
No worries, we'll get there.

3101
03:31:42,290 --> 03:31:42,770

3103
03:31:50,440 --> 03:31:52,860
The whole network expect me to process all the confiscated stuff.

3104
03:31:53,680 --> 03:31:54,920
Because we're the bottom branch for SDN.

3105
03:31:55,060 --> 03:31:56,920
We catch all kinds of shit work, bro.

3106

Only good thing?

3109

3113
03:33:24,220 --> 03:33:25,040
Oh, sure.

3114
03:33:25,240 --> 03:33:26,320
It's not mine.

3115
03:33:26,600 --> 03:33:30,020
By the way, they make me wear it, then it's back in a bag by midnight.

3116
03:33:30,820 --> 03:33:32,160
What is happening today?

3117
03:33:32,840 --> 03:33:33,280
Yeah.

3118
03:33:33,780 --> 03:33:34,820
What's happening today?

3119
03:33:35,400 --> 03:33:36,800
The thing you're going to.

3120
03:33:37,140 --> 03:33:40,040
SDN sponsoring a dinner gala thing.

3121
03:33:40,780 --> 03:33:42,640
Radiant Valor, a night of triumph.

3122
03:33:43,060 --> 03:33:44,860
Why does that sound like a propaganda rally?

3123
03:33:45,480 --> 03:33:45,660
There.

3124
03:33:45,880 --> 03:33:46,400
Thank you.

3125
03:33:46,840 --> 03:33:47,180
Yeah.

3126
03:33:47,940 --> 03:33:51,140
It does kind of sound like some sort of fascist-themed prom.

3127
03:33:51,940 --> 03:33:52,460
What do you think?

3128
03:33:52,780 --> 03:33:55,940
Someone was like secret identities, but I fucking...

3129
03:33:56,620 --> 03:34:02,860
You have your hair sticking out, and yet the bottom half of your face, and you can see the eyes.

3130
03:34:03,180 --> 03:34:04,960
You're not hiding anything.

3131
03:34:06,380 --> 03:34:07,400
Oh, hey, there's a nipple out.

3132
03:34:10,020 --> 03:34:11,360
Your ariola is showing.

3133
03:34:11,620 --> 03:34:15,300
No cause for alarm, but a little bit of your ariola is out.

3134
03:34:15,700 --> 03:34:17,140
It's like a slight hue shift.

3135
03:34:18,100 --> 03:34:20,020
You might as well take that mask off.

3136
03:34:20,020 --> 03:34:21,820
I don't think I've heard someone say Ariola out loud before.

3137
03:34:22,200 --> 03:34:23,540
It doesn't come up a ton, though.

3138
03:34:24,940 --> 03:34:25,400
All right.

3139
03:34:25,680 --> 03:34:26,220
For real now.

3140
03:34:26,940 --> 03:34:27,520
How do I look?

3141
03:34:28,280 --> 03:34:32,120
The breakup story is out, so I might be getting more attention.

3142
03:34:32,200 --> 03:34:33,680
You look incredible, girl.

3143
03:34:34,000 --> 03:34:36,020
I think you look incredible.

3144
03:34:36,680 --> 03:34:36,980
Thanks.

3145
03:34:38,060 --> 03:34:43,420
I was supposed to be going with him, but I don't think he's going to be making it.

3146
03:34:44,640 --> 03:34:45,960
The downtown branch dropped him.

3147
03:34:46,520 --> 03:34:47,440
Indefinite suspension.

3148
03:34:48,060 --> 03:35:46,820

03:35:49,040 --> 03:35:51,980
I'm sorry for your, you know, your loss.

3151
03:35:52,060 --> 03:35:53,000
It's very abrupt.

3152
03:35:53,860 --> 03:35:56,760
One moment we were savoring uni straight from the urchin.

3153
03:35:57,540 --> 03:36:01,060
Next moment, I'm contemplating flying into the sun.

3154
03:36:01,080 --> 03:36:01,860
What's stopping you?

3155
03:36:02,160 --> 03:36:05,180
Absorbing all its energy and casting this planet into infinite darkness.

3156
03:36:05,180 --> 03:36:07,700
Okay, yeah, no, don't do that.

3157
03:36:08,500 --> 03:36:09,020
Yeah, no.

3158
03:36:10,180 --> 03:36:13,480
Maybe then I would be free of the torment in my soul.

3159
03:36:17,580 --> 03:36:19,760
I've had those days.

3160
03:36:20,100 --> 03:36:22,260
I've been there last time I went to a breakup.

3161
03:36:22,560 --> 03:36:24,260
I drank mezcal, I blacked out.

3162
03:36:24,480 --> 03:36:31,800
When I came to I was in a dark void surrounded by the smell of rot and I was convinced I died and turned into a zombie.

3163
03:36:32,860 --> 03:36:36,780
Turns out I passed out at a urinal and somebody threw me in a dumpster.

3164
03:36:37,580 --> 03:36:39,320
Thank you for sharing that.

3165
03:36:39,640 --> 03:36:41,760
You aren't sad enough to understand.

3166
03:36:43,520 --> 03:36:44,840
See, we're just... Whoa!

3167
03:36:44,980 --> 03:36:46,100
Do you think there is someone else?

3168
03:36:46,620 --> 03:36:49,480
Perhaps another lover could be the cause of all this.

3169
03:36:50,000 --> 03:36:51,300
Maybe she met a person.

3170
03:36:51,400 --> 03:36:52,140
I kissed her.

3171
03:36:52,340 --> 03:36:53,060
An actual person.

3172
03:36:53,540 --> 03:36:54,760
I am not a person.

3173
03:36:54,940 --> 03:36:56,080
I just resemble one hand.

3174
03:36:56,320 --> 03:36:56,760
It was me.

3175
03:36:57,400 --> 03:36:59,640
Look, I'm not a man.

3176
03:36:59,900 --> 03:37:03,300
I'm only telling you this because I don't want you hearing it from someone else.

3177
03:37:03,440 --> 03:37:03,540
Yeah.

3178
03:37:04,020 --> 03:37:05,100
I kiss Blazer.

3179
03:37:05,300 --> 03:37:05,980
It was me.

3180
03:37:07,760 --> 03:37:08,260
That's right.

3181
03:37:08,280 --> 03:37:10,360
Before you incinerate me, it's worth noting.

3182
03:37:10,640 --> 03:37:12,380
I had no idea she was in a relationship.

3183
03:37:12,760 --> 03:37:14,780
This happened while we were together.

3184
03:37:15,500 --> 03:37:16,480
It just gets worse.

3185
03:37:16,620 --> 03:37:17,300
That's right.

3186
03:37:17,660 --> 03:37:18,580
Yeah, that's right.

3187
03:37:18,720 --> 03:37:19,680
You're a superhero.

3188
03:37:20,300 --> 03:37:21,840
And I'm a normal guy.

3189
03:37:22,160 --> 03:37:23,840
And then I kissed him.

3190
03:37:24,000 --> 03:37:25,380
Not to blame for my sadness.

3191
03:37:26,100 --> 03:37:27,260
Maybe, but I doubt it.

3192
03:37:27,260 --> 03:37:28,020
It was me.

3193
03:37:28,240 --> 03:37:31,040
I guess this is something she was thinking about for a while.

3194
03:37:31,060 --> 03:37:31,860
It was me, Flash.

3195
03:37:32,300 --> 03:37:33,500
I'm not that good of a kisser.

3196
03:37:37,080 --> 03:37:37,660
Oh, shit.

3197
03:37:37,880 --> 03:37:39,000
No, is he actually going to kill me?

3198
03:37:42,600 --> 03:37:43,040
Wait.

3199
03:37:44,280 --> 03:37:45,200
And I can't remember.

3200
03:37:46,960 --> 03:37:49,940
Bro, I could have remixed her and him!

3201
03:37:51,840 --> 03:37:53,900
Wait, am I that bad of a kisser?

3202
03:37:55,100 --> 03:37:58,100
Bro, I have a girl that's having horny dreams of me.

3203
03:37:58,200 --> 03:37:58,960
There's no way.

3204
03:37:59,720 --> 03:38:00,300
Oh, shit.

3205
03:38:04,360 --> 03:38:06,780
Aw, I can't even fly.

3206
03:38:07,900 --> 03:38:09,560
My kiss check failed.

3207
03:38:09,680 --> 03:38:10,860
I rolled a zero.

3208
03:38:12,320 --> 03:38:13,820
I didn't even know that was possible.

3209
03:38:14,220 --> 03:38:14,600
Where's the shootout?

3210
03:38:14,800 --> 03:38:16,600
The dice, like, exploded when I tried.

3211
03:38:16,620 --> 03:38:20,400
try to roll it a desk job would have me bleeding this often

3212

I'm a problem.

3217
03:40:02,530 --> 03:40:03,250
Hello, guys.

3218
03:40:03,350 --> 03:40:04,210
We're ready for work?

3219
03:40:05,370 --> 03:40:06,850
Oh, we're missing one person now.

3220
03:40:07,070 --> 03:40:08,070
It's weird that Koop's gone.

3221
03:40:08,890 --> 03:40:09,590
Glad you made the cut, though, dude.

3222
03:40:10,350 --> 03:40:12,510
Imagine if it was Koop and Vizzy together.

3223
03:40:12,690 --> 03:40:15,770
I imagine Koop and Vizzy all the time.

3224
03:40:18,170 --> 03:40:19,530
Help us get this stuff out of the dorm.

3225
03:40:19,890 --> 03:40:19,990

3226
03:40:20,270 --> 03:40:21,490
You guys do that kind of stuff?

3227
03:40:21,610 --> 03:40:23,210
Those that carry the bot lines.

3228
03:40:23,370 --> 03:40:23,830

Aren't you persistent?

3233
03:41:00,250 --> 03:41:00,970
Easy enough.

3234
03:41:03,990 --> 03:41:04,410
Guess what?

3235
03:41:04,930 --> 03:41:05,530

Or so not?

3238
03:41:07,790 --> 03:41:08,250
Oh, you're right.

3239
03:41:08,370 --> 03:41:09,570
I forgot they have perfect synergy.

3240
03:41:09,810 --> 03:41:12,790
I may not be everyone's taste, but I am a lot of people.

3241
03:41:12,810 --> 03:41:17,670
This guy in front of me just drove right off and he did not rush them to the hospital.

3242
03:41:17,870 --> 03:41:18,950
Okay, someone we can run.

3243
03:41:19,870 --> 03:41:20,750
Yeah, there you go.

3244
03:41:20,810 --> 03:41:21,190
Yeah, I follow.

3245
03:41:22,250 --> 03:41:22,730
You two can go.

3246
03:41:23,750 --> 03:41:25,130
He didn't do stuff together.

3247
03:41:25,690 --> 03:41:26,130
That's fine.

3248
03:41:26,430 --> 03:41:28,010
Hoping people is actually really cool.

3249
03:41:28,870 --> 03:41:30,010
Unless it's an annoying person.

3250
03:41:30,290 --> 03:41:31,450
It's third and seven.

3251
03:41:31,590 --> 03:41:31,830
Oh, wait.

3252
03:41:32,310 --> 03:41:33,850
Actually, let's do this.

3253
03:41:33,990 --> 03:41:35,010
Let's check them out.

3254
03:41:37,650 --> 03:41:39,470
Oh, this is not good.

3255
03:41:40,670 --> 03:41:40,970
Oh.

3256
03:41:42,030 --> 03:41:42,630
Oh.

3257
03:41:43,230 --> 03:41:43,710
Oh.

3258
03:41:43,710 --> 03:41:44,030
Oh.

3259
03:41:44,030 --> 03:41:45,150
That's a bruise to me, prayed.

3260
03:41:45,590 --> 03:41:46,530
That's fine.

3261
03:41:49,270 --> 03:41:50,210
That's okay.

3262
03:41:52,630 --> 03:41:53,230
Okay.

3263
03:41:53,750 --> 03:41:56,470
Can you look into their tax filings?

3264
03:41:57,110 --> 03:41:57,870
Oh, man.

3265
03:41:58,430 --> 03:41:59,710
They're definitely up to no good.

3266
03:41:59,910 --> 03:42:00,470
Oh, no.

3267
03:42:00,650 --> 03:42:01,750
They're committing tax fraud?

3268
03:42:02,930 --> 03:42:04,330
How could there is it?

3269
03:42:04,510 --> 03:42:05,530
That's a crime.

3270
03:42:05,930 --> 03:42:08,270
Guys, don't do that.

3271
03:42:10,490 --> 03:42:10,810
All right.

3272
03:42:11,310 --> 03:42:12,610
Admiral, thank you for the rage.

3273
03:42:13,310 --> 03:42:13,610
Thank you.

3274
03:42:14,070 --> 03:42:16,070
Let's get the charisma up still.

3275
03:42:18,430 --> 03:42:19,830
Time to freak someone else.

3276
03:42:20,210 --> 03:42:20,750
Oh, there you go.

3277
03:42:22,590 --> 03:42:23,110
Um...

3278
03:42:23,750 --> 03:42:24,630
I need more combat.

3279
03:42:26,630 --> 03:42:27,070
Okay.

3280
03:42:27,370 --> 03:42:31,590
And seven in the UCT red zone, and tensions have boiled over into a full-on...

3281
03:42:31,590 --> 03:42:32,850
Remove the troublemakers.

3282
03:42:33,210 --> 03:42:35,090
Okay, I'm gonna grab coffee.

3283
03:42:36,430 --> 03:42:36,870
And...

3284
03:42:36,870 --> 03:42:37,870
Fresh as a daisy.

3285
03:42:38,090 --> 03:42:38,970
All right, there you go.

3286
03:42:39,370 --> 03:42:39,830
You two.

3287
03:42:40,170 --> 03:42:40,770
I believe.

3288
03:42:40,970 --> 03:42:42,170
What's it going to be this time?

3289
03:42:43,010 --> 03:42:44,310
I believe in you two.

3290
03:42:45,390 --> 03:42:46,570
Okay, fly them to the hospital.

3291
03:42:46,650 --> 03:42:47,510
We have a flyer.

3292
03:42:47,870 --> 03:42:48,690
I feel like you didn't look.

3293
03:42:48,950 --> 03:42:50,790
Oh, thank you for the super chat.

03:42:51,170 --> 03:42:51,730

Who was it that I told to do that?

3300
03:43:29,310 --> 03:43:30,970

Okay, it's wolves.

03:45:08,320 --> 03:45:08,520
Okay.

3316
03:45:09,520 --> 03:45:10,580
We're not cheating.

3317
03:45:11,400 --> 03:45:13,440
I'm just at chat.

3318
03:45:13,880 --> 03:45:14,340
Oh, incinerate.

3319
03:45:14,440 --> 03:45:14,860

03:45:18,280 --> 03:45:18,300
Okay.

3322
03:45:19,500 --> 03:45:20,700
There we go, we did it.

3323
03:45:20,720 --> 03:45:22,840
I'm snacking mad doves today, baby.

3324
03:45:23,000 --> 03:45:23,680
Oh, thank God.

3325
03:45:25,340 --> 03:45:25,900
On Fuego.

3326
03:45:26,580 --> 03:45:27,580
Oh, God, there's so many.

3327
03:45:28,340 --> 03:45:31,580
Uh, we'll do vigor.

3328
03:45:33,060 --> 03:45:34,680
And then, God, there's so many people.

3329
03:45:34,800 --> 03:45:35,480
Hey, it's Rory Casey.

3330
03:45:35,760 --> 03:45:36,980
One of my teachers called out.

3331
03:45:37,120 --> 03:45:39,100
Guys, I don't have enough soup.

3332
03:45:39,160 --> 03:45:40,820
I have, I'm, we cut someone.

3333
03:45:40,960 --> 03:45:41,800
We cut someone, okay?

3334
03:45:42,100 --> 03:45:43,940
We have budget cuts, okay, guys?

3335
03:45:44,340 --> 03:45:47,500
Teach defense, assist with reflex.

3336
03:45:48,320 --> 03:45:51,280
There's been a talk about Koop's old crew being back in town.

3337
03:45:51,280 --> 03:45:52,640
Track down rumors.

3338
03:45:53,340 --> 03:45:56,160
Asserting the organization's target.

3339
03:45:56,780 --> 03:45:57,440
Shut your hole.

3340
03:45:57,740 --> 03:45:58,700
Everyone just relax.

3341
03:45:58,840 --> 03:46:00,260
I'm sure it's just a very unfortunate.

3342
03:46:00,260 --> 03:46:01,200
Oh, we are short-handed.

3343
03:46:01,520 --> 03:46:03,540
I can't believe it's a pay not good.

3344
03:46:04,680 --> 03:46:06,360
I thought the pay was good.

3345
03:46:07,560 --> 03:46:12,220
Toss, destroy the remains of Toss.

3346
03:46:12,360 --> 03:46:13,000
Oh, God.

3347
03:46:14,120 --> 03:46:15,960
We can handle this.

3348
03:46:18,640 --> 03:46:19,120
Oh.

3349
03:46:19,800 --> 03:46:20,120
Oh, wait.

3350
03:46:20,380 --> 03:46:20,380
Okay.

3351
03:46:20,980 --> 03:46:20,980
97.

3352
03:46:21,440 --> 03:46:22,860
There's no way I lose this.

3353
03:46:23,500 --> 03:46:24,380
Alright, that's good.

3354
03:46:25,600 --> 03:46:26,080
Sick.

3355
03:46:28,100 --> 03:46:30,520
Okay, we gotta send one person at a time now.

3356
03:46:34,960 --> 03:46:34,960
Defense.

3357
03:46:35,760 --> 03:46:35,760
Drill.

3358
03:46:36,380 --> 03:46:36,700
Reflex.

3359
03:46:36,860 --> 03:46:37,140
God.

3360
03:46:37,300 --> 03:46:37,620
Fuck.

3361
03:46:37,960 --> 03:46:37,960
Okay.

3362
03:46:38,600 --> 03:46:39,220
Track that.

3363
03:46:39,220 --> 03:46:39,860
You got this.

3364
03:46:39,980 --> 03:46:40,360
You can track.

3365
03:46:41,060 --> 03:46:42,000
You go in by yourself.

3366
03:46:42,260 --> 03:46:42,520
I believe.

3367
03:46:42,880 --> 03:46:44,460
I'm a fucking loser that needs us that I'm on my way.

3368
03:46:44,500 --> 03:46:44,980
Oh, no.

3369
03:46:45,280 --> 03:46:46,140
Oh, no.

3370
03:46:46,260 --> 03:46:46,460
Okay.

3371
03:46:46,500 --> 03:46:48,260
I'm gonna send Prism out here.

3372
03:46:48,320 --> 03:46:55,660
Okay, actually, uh, here, you got this, and then you go teach.

3373
03:46:55,940 --> 03:46:57,440
You have good reflexes.

3374
03:46:57,760 --> 03:47:00,060
You don't, but I don't have anyone else.

3375
03:47:00,480 --> 03:47:02,240
Actually, I can cut this close.

3376
03:47:02,880 --> 03:47:04,180
All right, you too.

3377
03:47:04,220 --> 03:47:05,020
Go teach.

3378
03:47:09,820 --> 03:47:10,700
Oh, fuck, okay.

3379
03:47:12,080 --> 03:47:13,760
Oh, oh, thank God, 65.

3380
03:47:13,980 --> 03:47:14,440
We made it.

3381
03:47:15,140 --> 03:47:15,680
We made it.

3382
03:47:15,780 --> 03:47:15,780
Not bad.

3383
03:47:15,780 --> 03:47:16,060
Not bad at all.

3384
03:47:17,040 --> 03:47:17,400
Thank God.

3385
03:47:17,440 --> 03:47:18,440
This is why we didn't cut you.

3386
03:47:19,300 --> 03:47:20,140
I'll keep you around.

3387
03:47:20,640 --> 03:48:09,660

Wait.

3389
03:48:20,120 --> 03:48:20,620
Okay, wait.

3390
03:48:21,020 --> 03:48:21,920
He's a mind reader.

3391
03:48:22,560 --> 03:48:23,800
She has X-ray vision.

3392
03:48:24,440 --> 03:48:25,600
Together they are.

3393
03:48:25,860 --> 03:48:26,720
Send someone.

3394
03:48:27,900 --> 03:48:29,360
Okay, I think...

3395
03:48:29,360 --> 03:48:29,500
Oh, sorry.

3396
03:48:29,720 --> 03:48:30,300
Is this SDN?

3397
03:48:30,800 --> 03:48:31,420
We need help.

3398
03:48:32,320 --> 03:48:32,860
Okay, wait.

3399
03:48:33,420 --> 03:48:33,860
Obviously...

3400
03:48:33,860 --> 03:48:34,840
No, you're not doing this.

3401
03:48:35,820 --> 03:48:36,080
Alright.

3402
03:48:36,680 --> 03:48:37,360
She's fast.

3403
03:48:38,160 --> 03:48:38,760
You're training.

3404
03:48:39,220 --> 03:48:39,700
You know what?

3405
03:48:39,800 --> 03:48:40,500
Go do your thing.

3406
03:48:41,940 --> 03:48:43,080
I'm investing it all.

3407
03:48:43,940 --> 03:48:46,300
Wait, I had another one?

3408
03:48:46,300 --> 03:48:49,540
Oh my god, I already, but like, someone called us about a bomb in one of the theaters?

3409
03:48:50,560 --> 03:48:53,340
Oh my god, bro, okay, um...

3410
03:48:53,340 --> 03:48:54,060
Oh, no.

3411
03:48:54,580 --> 03:48:55,460
Protect the couple.

3412
03:48:55,620 --> 03:48:58,300
Send someone good at defusing situation.

3413
03:48:58,760 --> 03:48:59,760
Who is good at...

3414
03:48:59,760 --> 03:49:01,520
I assume Prism, right?

3415
03:49:02,120 --> 03:49:04,040
I think Prism can make it.

3416
03:49:08,580 --> 03:49:12,560
When in high breath, Sonar said he would talk his way out of it and re-attempt the car.

3417
03:49:13,640 --> 03:49:14,940
Sonar is immune and his resting...

3418
03:49:14,940 --> 03:49:16,680
Okay, yeah, we're gonna talk your way out of this.

3419
03:49:19,380 --> 03:49:21,400
Use that Harvard education you got.

3420
03:49:22,080 --> 03:49:22,280
All right.

3421
03:49:23,580 --> 03:49:26,040
Locate the bomb and disarm it.

3422
03:49:28,280 --> 03:49:29,840
Are you good at locating?

3423
03:49:33,840 --> 03:49:35,040
Maybe these two.

3424
03:49:36,980 --> 03:49:37,780
Yeah, they'll be fine.

3425
03:49:37,940 --> 03:49:38,900
Yeah, that's going to leave a mark.

3426
03:49:39,380 --> 03:49:39,840
There we go.

3427
03:49:39,980 --> 03:49:41,200
And then I can...

3428
03:49:41,200 --> 03:49:42,500
Oh, thank God.

3429
03:49:42,660 --> 03:49:44,060
Okay, you're healed.

3430
03:49:44,660 --> 03:49:45,800
I can wait a little bit.

3431
03:49:45,840 --> 03:49:47,020
I'm going to get Prism in here.

3432
03:49:49,480 --> 03:49:49,920
Oh?

3433
03:49:50,600 --> 03:49:51,040
Oh.

3434
03:49:51,060 --> 03:49:54,200
Which movie theater should we search first, guys?

3435
03:49:56,220 --> 03:49:57,460
Oh, is tracking intelligence?

3436
03:49:57,620 --> 03:49:59,180
Oh, we are so fucking stupid.

3437
03:49:59,540 --> 03:50:03,720
Oh, it's okay.

3438
03:50:03,780 --> 03:50:04,980
He can burn the bomb.

3439
03:50:05,120 --> 03:50:05,860
We can burn.

3440
03:50:06,560 --> 03:50:07,080
Chat.

3441
03:50:09,020 --> 03:50:10,220
Standing alive.

3442
03:50:10,480 --> 03:50:10,720
Okay.

3443
03:50:11,320 --> 03:50:12,260
Wow, guys.

3444
03:50:12,560 --> 03:50:14,220
What a lucky guess.

3445
03:50:16,320 --> 03:50:16,600
Oh.

3446
03:50:17,180 --> 03:50:18,260
I need punch.

3447
03:50:18,340 --> 03:50:19,580
He fucking left.

3448
03:50:21,920 --> 03:50:51,080
activate crawl through the vents guys we have zero intelligence which one is not the I feel like crawl crawl because I feel like activating requires IQ but we are three we're good at everything but IQ oh thank god oh thank god we just made it we're just fast enough that's how we do it down under ready okay we got prism Alright.

3449
03:50:52,040 --> 03:50:53,160
I'll put you two in here.

3450
03:50:54,040 --> 03:50:55,620
Robert, you were the last one to see my stapler.

3451
03:50:56,300 --> 03:50:56,760
What was I?

3452
03:50:57,300 --> 03:50:58,260
I don't think that's true.

3453
03:50:58,500 --> 03:50:59,500
You're the prime suspect.

3454
03:50:59,780 --> 03:51:00,820
Oh, come on!

3455
03:51:02,200 --> 03:51:02,880
Oh, oh, oh!

3456
03:51:02,940 --> 03:51:03,420
It doesn't matter!

3457
03:51:03,620 --> 03:51:04,140
It doesn't matter!

3458
03:51:04,200 --> 03:51:04,760
Let's go!

3459
03:51:05,540 --> 03:51:06,340
We did it!

3460
03:51:06,640 --> 03:51:07,840
We detained the youths!

3461
03:51:07,880 --> 03:51:08,920
Yeah, fuck the children!

3462
03:51:10,700 --> 03:51:13,980
We tried to do it ourselves, but then I remembered my motto in life.

3463
03:51:14,300 --> 03:51:16,280
Why do it when you can make someone else do it for you?

3464
03:51:16,280 --> 03:51:17,000
Oh, you smart.

3465
03:51:17,160 --> 03:51:17,420
Okay.

3466
03:51:19,080 --> 03:51:19,480
Yeah.

3467
03:51:20,140 --> 03:51:21,660
That requires a brain.

3468
03:51:22,200 --> 03:51:24,320
Wait, we're doing, like, task rabbit here.

3469
03:51:25,360 --> 03:51:25,440
What?

3470
03:51:25,560 --> 03:51:25,880
No, Phil.

3471
03:51:25,920 --> 03:51:26,940
Can you just walk him around?

3472
03:51:27,100 --> 03:51:27,660
Walk Phil.

3473
03:51:27,840 --> 03:51:29,560
Phil is imposed hard.

3474
03:51:29,920 --> 03:51:30,200
God damn it.

3475
03:51:30,260 --> 03:51:31,120
Okay, we can wait a little.

3476
03:51:32,660 --> 03:51:33,340
That's fine.

3477
03:51:33,660 --> 03:51:35,120
Okay, we need someone strong.

3478
03:51:36,080 --> 03:51:36,860
Oh, disrupted.

3479
03:51:38,300 --> 03:51:38,860
Yeah, okay.

3480
03:51:38,980 --> 03:51:39,400
Mediate the argument.

3481
03:51:39,800 --> 03:51:41,480
Oh, I'll get to the bottom of this shit.

3482
03:51:44,360 --> 03:51:44,900
Alright, nice.

3483
03:51:45,040 --> 03:51:46,180
I'm glad there's no Grammy for this.

3484
03:51:47,280 --> 03:51:48,060
We did it.

3485
03:51:49,280 --> 03:51:50,080
Argument, mediated.

3486
03:51:50,140 --> 03:52:52,140

03:52:56,560 --> 03:52:57,260
Where was it?

3489
03:52:57,980 --> 03:52:58,480
Immobility.

3490
03:52:59,240 --> 03:53:00,360
Actually, the combat.

3491
03:53:02,660 --> 03:53:03,160
And...

3492
03:53:03,160 --> 03:53:05,340
Yes, I can equalize Mal.

3493
03:53:06,720 --> 03:53:10,460
Uh, I'll put her, I'll make her more of a all-around person.

3494
03:53:10,540 --> 03:53:12,720
Hey, it's Jerry from Comic Pug.

3495
03:53:13,420 --> 03:53:15,420
We got a gift of some Mega Man replicas.

3496
03:53:15,840 --> 03:53:17,540
Yeah, but with all the bomb threats going on.

3497
03:53:17,600 --> 03:53:18,260
Suspicious Mega Man?

3498
03:53:20,360 --> 03:53:22,240
Mech, but with bomb threats.

3499
03:53:22,300 --> 03:53:24,100
I forgot what works with bomb threats.

3500
03:53:26,060 --> 03:53:27,840
Should we just go with bomb threats again?

3501
03:53:30,820 --> 03:53:31,300
Why?

3502
03:53:31,700 --> 03:53:33,600
Nothing beats the original, but...

3503
03:53:33,600 --> 03:53:34,580
It's fine, right?

3504
03:53:35,080 --> 03:53:36,260
We don't need...

3505
03:53:36,260 --> 03:53:37,060
We don't need vigor.

3506
03:53:39,320 --> 03:53:40,080
I think it's fine.

3507
03:53:40,240 --> 03:53:41,000
We got two in.

3508
03:53:41,300 --> 03:53:44,400
We're doing pretty good at the real part of the game.

3509
03:53:45,120 --> 03:53:45,560
We only had...

3510
03:53:45,560 --> 03:53:49,120
We fucked up one thing, and that was with Punch-Out, and now he's not there anymore.

3511
03:53:50,340 --> 03:53:52,860
Which mecha man contains the bomb?

3512
03:53:52,940 --> 03:53:54,500
What happens when we fuck up the choice?

3513
03:53:54,640 --> 03:53:55,640
It's like one out of three.

3514
03:53:56,880 --> 03:53:58,200
And this is a clean ass run.

3515
03:53:58,460 --> 03:53:59,140
Alright, at chat.

3516
03:54:00,720 --> 03:54:02,420
Let's do a lucky guess, guys.

3517
03:54:02,600 --> 03:54:04,200
This is all luck, by the way.

3518
03:54:04,420 --> 03:54:05,260
All luck.

3519
03:54:05,420 --> 03:54:05,820
Wow.

3520
03:54:06,300 --> 03:54:06,920
Who would...

3521
03:54:06,920 --> 03:54:07,740
Wow, guys.

3522
03:54:07,760 --> 03:54:08,880
We're so lucky.

3523
03:54:09,500 --> 03:54:12,580
How do we keep guessing the right mechas, chat?

3524
03:54:13,080 --> 03:54:14,240
Oh my god.

3525
03:54:14,460 --> 03:54:15,620
We're so smart.

3526
03:54:16,400 --> 03:54:19,120
We just somehow keep guessing the right ones.

3527
03:54:20,140 --> 03:54:21,820
We're like psychic or something.

3528
03:54:22,080 --> 03:54:22,960
And that's lunch.

3529
03:54:23,060 --> 03:54:24,200
They're so lucky.

3530
03:54:24,680 --> 03:54:25,880
Oh, great.

3531
03:54:26,460 --> 03:54:28,460
I'ma drink my spicy water.

3532
03:54:30,600 --> 03:54:31,380
All right, nice.

3533
03:54:31,580 --> 03:54:32,280
We only failed one.

3534
03:54:32,580 --> 03:54:33,240
That's fine.

3535
03:54:35,760 --> 03:54:36,440
Under review?

3536
03:54:36,560 --> 03:54:38,020
I haven't even been paid yet?

3537
03:54:38,300 --> 03:54:39,380
Like, what?

3538
03:54:39,940 --> 03:54:40,920
Oh, hey, a melon.

3539
03:54:41,660 --> 03:54:42,220
And chocolate?

3540
03:54:48,960 --> 03:54:50,400
Still working on that?

3541
03:54:51,020 --> 03:54:52,600
Aren't these the best?

3542
03:54:52,600 --> 03:55:22,820
I love the green ones the the green do oh the honey damn take the whole thing if you want awesome my lucky day I I know what's for lunch or dinner probably now sorry I uh interrupt bro if that bake has a nice ass my guy has his ass you feel my noodles away my initials were literally on the box and everything fuck I I don't read things sometimes it's different like a logo but it's probably still good I I don't What?

3543
03:55:23,120 --> 03:55:24,840
The fucking trash noodles?

3544
03:55:25,200 --> 03:55:25,800
Wet fart boy?

3545
03:55:26,160 --> 03:55:26,920
Whoa, what are you doing?

3546
03:55:27,220 --> 03:55:27,360
Whatever.

3547
03:55:27,660 --> 03:55:28,320
It was an accident.

3548
03:55:28,680 --> 03:55:30,920
Just aim your dick up and water piss it off.

3549
03:55:31,240 --> 03:55:32,200
That's not...

3550
03:55:32,940 --> 03:55:33,320
You...

3551
03:55:34,160 --> 03:55:37,760
To be fair, he wasn't being a really bad janitor, though.

3552
03:55:37,760 --> 03:55:40,520
How would you like to have to walk around work the rest of the day with shit all of you?

3553
03:55:40,540 --> 03:55:40,980
I don't know.

3554
03:55:41,060 --> 03:55:41,840
I don't think about that.

3555
03:55:41,980 --> 03:55:42,800
Because it won't happen.

3556
03:55:42,980 --> 03:55:45,360
Because I'm not a fucking idiot food thrower away here.

3557
03:55:45,640 --> 03:55:46,580
It was an accident.

3558
03:55:46,700 --> 03:55:48,280
You don't have to be a bully about it.

3559
03:55:48,540 --> 03:55:49,620
You want this in your report?

3560
03:55:50,040 --> 03:55:51,440
You're gonna snitch on me?

3561
03:55:53,180 --> 03:55:55,980
Wait, I can't even snitch on it.

3562
03:55:55,980 --> 03:55:57,600
I was being a soft bitch about it.

3563
03:55:59,660 --> 03:56:00,240
How am I being?

3564
03:56:02,580 --> 03:56:03,580
In fact!

3565
03:56:05,880 --> 03:56:06,980
Oh, wow.

3566
03:56:07,140 --> 03:56:09,240
I wasn't expecting it to go straight.

3567
03:56:09,800 --> 03:56:10,440
That was extra.

3568
03:56:10,940 --> 03:56:11,280
Sorry.

3569
03:56:12,000 --> 03:56:12,940
Spaghetti or spaghetti.

3570
03:56:13,540 --> 03:56:14,960
You're gonna choke on this fucking...

3571
03:56:14,960 --> 03:56:16,380
Hey, Robert, could you...

3572
03:56:16,380 --> 03:56:17,080
Spaghetti.

3573
03:56:18,640 --> 03:56:19,620
Did you eat my lunch?

3574
03:56:20,140 --> 03:56:20,340
Oh.

3575
03:56:20,400 --> 03:56:21,180
Why would you do that?

3576
03:56:21,920 --> 03:56:48,260
I don't want to be a snitch but flambé was really payback another hr report i don't even think they have hr well if you're gonna eat it i wish more of it got into your mouth go get cleaned up then clean this up then pick me up a blt from johnny's and we'll call it even yes what i'm saying is that like okay i feel like working hr for superheroes is like

3577
03:56:51,420 --> 03:56:52,760
Who's it going to be?

3578
03:56:53,140 --> 03:56:54,260
Phenomenon or Waterboy?

3579
03:56:54,820 --> 03:56:57,240
And these two are my only options.

3580
03:56:57,920 --> 03:56:58,740
For now, yeah.

3581
03:56:59,380 --> 03:57:00,540
Obviously, we can revisit it.

3582
03:57:00,780 --> 03:57:03,800
But Waterboy is already a trainee, sort of.

3583
03:57:03,920 --> 03:57:06,560
And you already know Phenomenon got cut by DTLA.

3584
03:57:07,280 --> 03:57:09,080
Thanks for getting him out of the parking lot, by the way.

3585
03:57:09,600 --> 03:57:14,760
It might also help to get, you know, an actual good person on your team, which...

3586
03:57:14,760 --> 03:57:15,160
Wait.

3587
03:57:15,920 --> 03:57:17,280
Are we cutting someone?

3588
03:57:19,080 --> 03:57:21,160
Like, if I pick someone, do I cut...

3589
03:57:21,180 --> 03:57:26,800
Put him on my team or joining my team.

3590
03:57:26,900 --> 03:57:27,960
Okay, I'm picking someone.

3591
03:57:28,240 --> 03:57:30,240
I am not picking Waterboy.

3592
03:57:31,480 --> 03:57:32,370
Guys, I...

3593
03:57:33,160 --> 03:57:34,980
There's no way.

3594
03:57:35,580 --> 03:57:40,840
If anything, Phenomena as act as a real fucking superhero.

3595
03:57:41,380 --> 03:57:43,980
Like, like, why?

3596
03:57:44,580 --> 03:57:45,900
I don't...

3597
03:57:45,900 --> 03:57:46,200
Bro.

3598
03:57:48,580 --> 03:57:55,260
Bro, Yes, I'd rather have a depressed Superman than someone that can't do anything.

3599
03:57:56,060 --> 03:57:58,520
It was at least a depressed Superman.

3600
03:57:59,040 --> 03:58:01,240
We don't need another healer.

3601
03:58:02,200 --> 03:58:05,700
Having another healer implies that I'd fuck up, but I don't fuck up.

3602
03:58:05,760 --> 03:58:10,080
Think of the potential.

3603
03:58:11,140 --> 03:58:11,320
Justice.

3604
03:58:11,520 --> 03:58:12,220
All right, we flip.

3605
03:58:12,560 --> 03:58:13,880
All right, we flip a coin.

3606
03:58:14,860 --> 03:58:16,540
Heads is water boy.

3607
03:58:17,120 --> 03:58:18,580
Tails is a phenomenon.

3608
03:58:19,140 --> 03:58:20,500
We're, we're, okay.

3609
03:58:20,500 --> 03:58:42,820

I'll be right back.

3612
03:59:23,300 --> 03:59:23,940
Yeah, that's right.

3613
03:59:24,280 --> 03:59:24,680
That's right.

3614
03:59:24,720 --> 03:59:25,920
We're accepting bribes now.

3615
03:59:26,080 --> 03:59:30,260
How else do you think people lobby shit in, in?

3616
03:59:31,700 --> 03:59:32,360
That's right.

3617
03:59:32,420 --> 03:59:33,160
We're lobbying.

3618
03:59:35,000 --> 03:59:37,060
I'm going to teach you what lobbying means.

3619
03:59:37,560 --> 03:59:38,740
I'll be right back, guys.

3620
03:59:38,900 --> 03:59:39,480
I go pee.

3621
04:00:43,910 --> 04:00:44,110

04:02:28,990 --> 04:02:30,790
Oh, unfortunate Waterboy.

3634
04:02:31,610 --> 04:02:38,310
It looks like Phenoma man came in at the last second to lobby you up.

3635
04:02:38,690 --> 04:02:38,870
Sorry.

3636
04:02:39,050 --> 04:02:50,990
As I kindly take the donations for my campaign under the table, I have decided to go with potential man.

Wait, Potential Man is?

3640
04:03:26,930 --> 04:03:28,270
Guys, okay, Greaves.

3641
04:03:28,670 --> 04:03:29,650
Wait, no, no, no.

3642
04:03:29,850 --> 04:03:33,010
Wait, Greaves donated before and with who he wanted.

3643
04:03:33,650 --> 04:03:34,250
Wait, he hasn't.

3644
04:03:34,410 --> 04:03:35,490
Greaves, all right.

3645
04:03:35,950 --> 04:03:37,070
Did you want it?

3646
04:03:37,110 --> 04:03:41,910
Greaves, did you want a Phenomenman or Waterboy?

3647
04:03:42,510 --> 04:03:45,910
Your donation changes the course of time.

3648
04:03:48,230 --> 04:03:51,130
I call both Potential Man, to be fair.

3649
04:03:53,210 --> 04:04:00,410
Are we, because Greece donation cements whether or not it's water boy or Phenomenon.

3650
04:04:01,690 --> 04:04:02,910
What did Greece say?

3651
04:04:06,290 --> 04:04:07,550
Yeah, water.

3652
04:04:08,590 --> 04:04:11,390
Is it, was it blue for water?

3653
04:04:14,270 --> 04:04:16,570
Greece, please.

3654
04:04:20,150 --> 04:04:22,670
It's a blue doorknob.

3655
04:04:23,210 --> 04:04:25,630
Is it blue for water, Greaves?

3656
04:04:25,950 --> 04:04:26,710
Water,

3657
04:04:29,950 --> 04:04:29,950
boy.

3658
04:04:30,230 --> 04:04:31,190
Blue for water.

3659
04:04:31,310 --> 04:04:32,650
I gotta be sure.

3660
04:04:33,150 --> 04:04:33,930
It's phenomenal.

3661
04:04:34,150 --> 04:04:36,570
Or is it his depression tears?

3662
04:04:37,110 --> 04:04:38,330
I gotta be sure.

3663
04:04:38,830 --> 04:04:46,950
Because your vote, your vote is the one that changes it all.

3664
04:04:48,570 --> 04:04:48,870
Blue.

3665
04:04:49,430 --> 04:04:51,010
He said it's phenomenal.

3666
04:04:53,210 --> 04:04:55,010
It's depression, man.

3667
04:04:55,390 --> 04:04:59,430
Guys, I don't know if you're fucking with me or if that's what he wants.

3668
04:04:59,790 --> 04:05:03,650
Guys, he said depression, man.

3669
04:05:04,090 --> 04:05:06,130
What if you're making that shit up?

3670
04:05:07,390 --> 04:05:08,630
It's depression, man.

3671
04:05:08,830 --> 04:05:09,310
I'm positive.

3672
04:05:09,530 --> 04:05:10,350
Both of them are.

3673
04:05:10,910 --> 04:05:12,230
Phenomenal, man, I guess.

3674
04:05:12,770 --> 04:05:15,410
I mean, I'm worried he has too much time to think right now.

3675
04:05:16,010 --> 04:05:16,570
That's...

3676
04:05:16,570 --> 04:05:18,150
Yeah, I feel the same way.

3677
04:05:18,630 --> 04:05:19,750
He could use a distraction.

3678
04:05:20,430 --> 04:05:22,950
So it won't be weird with your ex-boyfriend.

3679
04:05:23,210 --> 04:06:24,550
water boy i mean he's already hanging around so he may as well be doing some good instead of moping around the parking lot crushing cars now we phenomena has won the lobby i'll let him know you'll see him in the roster for your next dispatch why would i get mad it's okay he can drown his tears with work justice for water boy it's a fair and honest vote guys whoa a moment of your time how do you move so quiet the power of donations if it would make you more comfortable i could remove my clothes as well it would not look if this is about picking you for z team wasn't even a hard decision thank you no need see look at that but to do good you need to be doing i don't even watch you i just wanted to ruin the days of Waterboy!

3680
04:06:26,430 --> 04:06:28,110
Like a true village.

3681
04:06:28,190 --> 04:06:28,710
Oh, shit.

3682
04:06:29,010 --> 04:06:31,010
I'm going to have reopened your chest wounds.

3683
04:06:32,490 --> 04:06:34,110
He's thinking of a super chat thing.

3684
04:06:34,970 --> 04:06:35,220
Thank you.

3685
04:06:38,610 --> 04:06:40,930
Waterboy tried lobbying first.

3686
04:06:45,700 --> 04:06:48,280
He just wanted to see the world suffer.

3687
04:06:51,120 --> 04:06:51,680
Where is he?

3688
04:06:51,780 --> 04:06:52,780
Where's potential, man?

3689
04:06:52,940 --> 04:06:52,980
Hey, team.

3690
04:06:53,180 --> 04:06:54,740
We appreciate you doing your best.

3691
04:06:54,840 --> 04:06:55,620
Last shift under the sun.

04:06:55,640 --> 04:07:26,740

04:07:29,580 --> 04:07:30,360
Don't like me.

3694
04:07:30,480 --> 04:07:32,120
The mean child is correct.

3695
04:07:32,580 --> 04:07:37,580
Wait, I think, no, I'm glad we picked Phenomenal.

3696
04:07:37,900 --> 04:07:41,360
The opportunity to see her again will make every day easier.

3697
04:07:42,300 --> 04:07:44,100
I think you gotta be backwards, bro.

3698
04:07:44,160 --> 04:07:46,080
Yeah, it don't work that way, boy.

3699
04:07:46,780 --> 04:07:47,640
Trust me.

3700
04:07:49,240 --> 04:07:50,340
Oh, you're so depressed.

3701
04:07:50,500 --> 04:07:50,960
It's great.

3702
04:07:51,120 --> 04:07:54,520
We have reason to believe that Mr. Vanderstank's life will be in danger out of me.

3703
04:07:54,520 --> 04:07:55,120
You know what?

3704
04:07:55,640 --> 04:07:56,440
I got you.

3705
04:07:56,620 --> 04:07:57,140
You know what?

3706
04:07:57,400 --> 04:07:58,140
Really want me?

3707
04:07:58,820 --> 04:07:59,220
Yeah.

3708
04:08:00,580 --> 04:08:02,060
I got you, bro.

3709
04:08:03,760 --> 04:08:04,700
Go in there.

3710
04:08:04,920 --> 04:08:05,220
You...

3711
04:08:05,220 --> 04:08:06,560
No, I didn't just get ditched.

3712
04:08:07,100 --> 04:08:07,400
Apologies.

3713
04:08:07,700 --> 04:08:07,880
What?

3714
04:08:08,140 --> 04:08:10,600
I thought I saw a blonde blazer in distress.

3715
04:08:11,240 --> 04:08:12,040
Phenomenal man.

3716
04:08:12,780 --> 04:08:13,600
I'm at the office.

3717
04:08:14,100 --> 04:08:18,300
These one-on-one scenery, I think I can make this a regular thing.

3718
04:08:18,460 --> 04:08:19,580
Oh, who should get it?

3719
04:08:20,140 --> 04:08:20,500
You know what?

3720
04:08:20,500 --> 04:08:21,420
I'll put you in.

3721
04:08:22,360 --> 04:08:23,300
Wait, don't worry.

3722
04:08:23,380 --> 04:08:24,800
He's coming in to help out.

3723
04:08:25,900 --> 04:08:27,120
Wait, did he help out?

3724
04:08:27,300 --> 04:08:28,180
Wait, he did it.

3725
04:08:28,300 --> 04:08:29,100
Wait, where was he?

3726
04:08:29,140 --> 04:08:31,000
Hey, so we're a little down on new subscribers this month.

3727
04:08:31,560 --> 04:08:32,580
I think you can spare here.

3728
04:08:33,320 --> 04:08:34,860
Cheerful, positive attitude.

3729
04:08:35,340 --> 04:08:35,760
Budget cuts.

3730
04:08:36,180 --> 04:08:38,240
Well, then how the fuck are we supposed to do this?

3731
04:08:38,540 --> 04:08:40,660
You could try charming them with your winning personality.

3732
04:08:40,860 --> 04:08:42,380
Oh, wait, we have charisma here.

3733
04:08:42,580 --> 04:08:43,760
Yeah, there you go.

3734
04:08:44,680 --> 04:08:45,760
Wait, who has more charisma?

3735
04:08:46,560 --> 04:08:47,940
Yeah, he has most charisma.

3736
04:08:48,940 --> 04:08:50,160
That's why we have a clone.

3737
04:08:51,820 --> 04:08:52,260
What's this?

3738
04:08:52,340 --> 04:09:22,560
After also creates a portal, near the call also reveals the stats the next call she's assigned to okay we should do that that's fine it's okay we had his clone we don't need him we have the clone guys oh my god okay that's fine that's why no we did it guys it's okay we have the clone van der stank lives to innovate another day see look he did his job technically

3739
04:09:26,100 --> 04:09:27,740
Yeah, the clone wasn't depressed.

3740
04:09:27,940 --> 04:09:30,040
I just gotta pair him up with a quick prism.

3741
04:09:31,860 --> 04:09:34,520
Send a charming and good-looking hero.

3742
04:09:35,600 --> 04:09:38,540
Physicality is valued in addition to looks.

3743
04:09:39,700 --> 04:09:41,640
I mean...

3744
04:09:44,990 --> 04:09:45,630
Phenomenal?

3745
04:09:45,870 --> 04:09:46,870
Do they like depressed?

3746
04:09:47,230 --> 04:09:49,110
Are they okay with depressed men?

3747
04:09:50,370 --> 04:09:51,010
Like...

3748
04:09:53,830 --> 04:09:56,670
I'm just... I'm wondering if he's depressed.

3749
04:09:56,950 --> 04:09:57,750
Is that okay?

3750
04:09:57,770 --> 04:10:01,410
Like, like, some women will want to fix him, right?

3751
04:10:01,930 --> 04:10:03,410
Like, that can work.

3752
04:10:08,890 --> 04:10:09,670
More charisma.

3753
04:10:16,280 --> 04:10:16,600
Okay.

3754
04:10:17,800 --> 04:10:18,680
Let's see.

3755
04:10:19,640 --> 04:10:20,080
On it.

3756
04:10:20,260 --> 04:10:20,780
I don't know.

3757
04:10:20,940 --> 04:10:21,420
Who's more?

3758
04:10:21,600 --> 04:10:24,060
Who's, who's Mel or Blam Bay?

3759
04:10:24,620 --> 04:10:26,640
Yeah, he does have Blam Bay in there.

3760
04:10:28,780 --> 04:10:30,920
Okay, let's grab combat too.

3761
04:10:34,620 --> 04:10:37,140
No, I don't think Punchy's gonna do it.

3762
04:10:39,360 --> 04:10:39,860
Prism?

3763
04:10:42,100 --> 04:10:42,100
Mal?

3764
04:10:42,420 --> 04:10:46,900
I feel like Waterboy had all the charisma.

3765
04:10:48,220 --> 04:10:48,380
Oh.

3766
04:10:49,220 --> 04:10:50,220
Okay, charming.

3767
04:10:52,000 --> 04:10:53,280
I think, like, Mal.

3768
04:10:53,500 --> 04:10:54,660
I mean, look at Mal.

3769
04:10:54,880 --> 04:10:55,560
What would your job be?

3770
04:10:55,900 --> 04:10:58,480
I feel like working at a gas station would be pretty chill.

3771
04:10:59,040 --> 04:10:59,760
Nice, we got it.

3772
04:10:59,820 --> 04:11:00,240
I'm not going to the pet store.

3773
04:11:00,400 --> 04:11:00,800
Yeah, right.

3774
04:11:00,880 --> 04:11:01,580
You hate pets.

3775
04:11:02,180 --> 04:11:04,820
I hate pets with bad attitudes.

3776
04:11:05,480 --> 04:11:06,640
What pets have good attitudes?

3777
04:11:07,160 --> 04:11:07,580
Snakes?

3778
04:11:08,360 --> 04:11:08,800
Snakes?

3779
04:11:09,740 --> 04:11:10,680
I guess so.

3780
04:11:10,800 --> 04:11:11,500
They're just chill.

3781
04:11:11,700 --> 04:11:12,760
Every snake is chill.

3782
04:11:13,100 --> 04:11:14,000
You just sit there.

3783
04:11:14,000 --> 04:11:18,120
Speaking of pets, I have recently learned of the American opossum.

3784
04:11:18,860 --> 04:11:21,540
I find it fascinating how it carries its children's heart.

3785
04:11:21,540 --> 04:11:21,680
Okay, sure.

3786
04:11:23,020 --> 04:11:24,280
Much like a bus.

3787
04:11:24,960 --> 04:11:26,180
What the fuck is he talking about?

3788
04:11:26,320 --> 04:11:28,100
Yeah, what the fuck is he talking about?

3789
04:11:28,920 --> 04:11:30,200
Possums aren't pets, man.

3790
04:11:30,440 --> 04:11:30,940
I see.

3791
04:11:31,960 --> 04:11:33,020
That's not true.

3792
04:11:33,160 --> 04:11:35,140
You can technically any animal can pee.

3793
04:11:35,160 --> 04:11:36,100
No, actually, don't do not.

3794
04:11:36,160 --> 04:11:36,840
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3795
04:11:36,900 --> 04:11:37,140
Wait, don't.

3796
04:11:37,160 --> 04:11:38,040
Don't quote me on that.

3797
04:11:38,380 --> 04:11:39,080
Don't quote me that.

3798
04:11:39,240 --> 04:11:41,800
I'm not in for exotic animals, guys.

3799
04:11:42,160 --> 04:11:42,940
Not all pets.

3800
04:11:42,940 --> 04:11:44,460
Guys, not all pets can be...

3801
04:11:44,460 --> 04:11:46,640
Not all animals can be pets, guys.

3802
04:11:48,140 --> 04:11:50,220
Not all animals can be pets.

3803
04:11:50,380 --> 04:11:51,800
Guys, I don't want to get in trouble.

3804
04:11:53,500 --> 04:11:56,400
They fight the mascot during halftime.

3805
04:11:56,960 --> 04:12:00,940
Make it look convincing, but pull your punches.

3806
04:12:01,720 --> 04:12:02,740
Maybe these two?

3807
04:12:04,980 --> 04:12:06,760
Do I need intelligence for that?

3808
04:12:08,020 --> 04:12:10,660
Like, do I gotta make it look smart?

3809
04:12:13,140 --> 04:12:14,380
I wasn't sure about it either.

3810
04:12:15,160 --> 04:12:16,140
I don't know about it.

3811
04:12:16,280 --> 04:12:17,320
You're trying to tell me something.

3812
04:12:19,140 --> 04:12:19,540
But...

3813
04:12:19,980 --> 04:12:20,900
I don't know.

3814
04:12:21,320 --> 04:12:21,720
Groovy.

3815
04:12:22,060 --> 04:12:25,800
I don't know if you need intelligence for that.

3816
04:12:26,540 --> 04:12:27,440
You need combat.

3817
04:12:27,680 --> 04:12:28,700
Yeah, I feel like I need...

3818
04:12:28,700 --> 04:12:30,060
You know what, I'll put Kodam in here.

3819
04:12:30,940 --> 04:12:31,620
I can do it.

3820
04:12:32,480 --> 04:12:33,200
I don't know.

3821
04:12:33,800 --> 04:12:34,560
Depends on the dirt.

3822
04:12:35,620 --> 04:12:36,840
Oh, packing time.

3823
04:12:37,160 --> 04:12:38,420
Ah, you lucky bastard.

3824
04:12:38,680 --> 04:12:40,040
Hacked into the computer?

3825
04:12:40,200 --> 04:12:41,220
Oh, it's no difficulty.

3826
04:12:41,340 --> 04:12:42,120
I got this.

3827
04:12:42,920 --> 04:12:44,020
That's for babies.

3828
04:12:44,300 --> 04:12:44,820
Look at that.

3829
04:12:46,860 --> 04:12:47,500
What's this?

3830
04:12:48,000 --> 04:12:49,440
Okay, I gotta get a key for that.

3831
04:12:52,340 --> 04:12:52,640
Oh.

3832
04:12:53,540 --> 04:12:54,660
Oh, wait, I'm timed.

3833
04:12:54,860 --> 04:12:56,120
Oh, I was not paying attention.

3834
04:13:00,660 --> 04:13:01,460
Oh, shit!

3835
04:13:02,740 --> 04:13:03,600
Oh, fuck.

3836
04:13:03,960 --> 04:13:05,740
Okay, um...

3837
04:13:08,810 --> 04:13:10,030
Oh, this is hard.

3838
04:13:16,490 --> 04:13:18,030

04:13:35,340 --> 04:13:36,660
Right, right, down.

3848
04:13:38,560 --> 04:13:39,100
Okay.

3849
04:13:44,900 --> 04:13:46,760
I gotta block him off?

3850
04:13:49,760 --> 04:13:50,920
Oh, no!

3851
04:13:52,020 --> 04:13:53,340

Okay.

3856
04:14:18,170 --> 04:14:19,710
And then I could do this.

3857
04:14:22,710 --> 04:14:23,750
Right, right, down.

3858
04:14:24,110 --> 04:14:24,430
Right, right.

3859
04:14:24,490 --> 04:14:25,910

04:14:26,810 --> 04:14:28,150
Okay, give me the right password.

What's the right password?

3862
04:14:33,550 --> 04:14:34,950

3863
04:14:34,970 --> 04:14:35,650

3868
04:14:44,410 --> 04:14:44,510

3869
04:14:44,830 --> 04:14:45,790
Right, right, down.

04:14:47,170 --> 04:14:48,590
Wait, left, left, up.

3871
04:14:48,830 --> 04:14:49,370

Oh.

3873
04:14:50,250 --> 04:14:51,110
Left, left, up.

3874
04:14:51,190 --> 04:14:51,850
Right, right, down.

3875
04:14:51,990 --> 04:14:52,150
Okay.

3876
04:14:52,850 --> 04:14:53,970

04:15:52,620 --> 04:15:54,060
The best at leaving a giant crater.

3888
04:15:54,540 --> 04:15:54,900
Guys, stop.

3889
04:15:55,200 --> 04:15:56,740

Stop.

3891
04:15:58,000 --> 04:16:00,420
He needs to keep himself safe, guys.

04:16:03,420 --> 04:16:07,380

Hello, dispatcher.

3898
04:16:42,180 --> 04:16:42,420
Hello?

3899
04:16:44,480 --> 04:16:45,820
What kind of game?

3900
04:16:46,060 --> 04:16:46,940
A brain teaser.

3901
04:16:47,800 --> 04:16:48,780
A brain teaser.

3902
04:16:49,360 --> 04:16:50,200

3903
04:16:50,520 --> 04:16:50,760

Oh, adopted.

3905
04:16:51,920 --> 04:16:53,080
His name is Brain Teaser.

3906
04:16:53,580 --> 04:16:54,780
How tricky can he be?

3907
04:16:54,860 --> 04:16:56,500
Oh my god, he's my Riddler.

3908
04:16:57,480 --> 04:16:58,920

04:17:03,720 --> 04:17:04,680
A new child.

3913
04:17:05,540 --> 04:17:06,500

We can wait a little bit.

3923
04:18:51,160 --> 04:18:51,560
Alright.

3924
04:18:53,880 --> 04:18:55,900
Okay, but we don't have enough intelligence, though.

3925
04:18:55,920 --> 04:18:56,620
That's the thing.

3926
04:18:57,340 --> 04:18:59,120
Wait, okay, he's gonna do this?

3927
04:18:59,460 --> 04:19:00,860
And then I'm gonna...

3928
04:19:00,860 --> 04:19:02,400
I'm gonna give it to the bat.

3929
04:19:04,860 --> 04:19:05,600
There we go.

3930
04:19:06,620 --> 04:19:08,140
I just wanna wait for him to return.

3931
04:19:09,220 --> 04:19:10,040
This is fine.

3932
04:19:10,560 --> 04:19:11,140
Oh, my gosh.

3933
04:19:12,620 --> 04:19:13,580
This is still fine.

3934
04:19:15,380 --> 04:19:15,660
No.

3935
04:19:16,020 --> 04:19:17,900
We invested it all on one guy.

3936
04:19:19,760 --> 04:19:20,280
That's fine.

3937
04:19:20,820 --> 04:19:20,960
All right.

3938
04:19:21,000 --> 04:19:22,020
And then he returns.

3939
04:19:22,460 --> 04:19:23,820
Half-batt all freak.

3940
04:19:24,000 --> 04:19:24,860
He's going to return.

3941
04:19:25,420 --> 04:19:27,560
And he's going to be teaser me this.

3942
04:19:29,080 --> 04:19:29,820
There you go.

3943
04:19:30,560 --> 04:19:31,100
There you go.

3944
04:19:31,220 --> 04:19:32,080
Go do your thing.

3945
04:19:32,440 --> 04:19:33,540
I need to find my...

3946
04:19:33,540 --> 04:19:34,180
Do your riddle.

3947
04:19:35,600 --> 04:19:37,260
It was standing up beer bottles.

3948
04:19:37,420 --> 04:19:38,520
Cheer up and persuade.

3949
04:19:38,620 --> 04:19:39,200
Okay, we can just do this.

3950
04:19:39,220 --> 04:19:39,640
these here.

3951
04:19:40,940 --> 04:19:41,700
Oh, he's back.

3952
04:19:41,820 --> 04:19:42,960
He's not depressed anymore.

3953
04:19:43,540 --> 04:19:45,180
Intercom malfunctioning.

3954
04:19:46,340 --> 04:19:47,120
Can anyone hear me?

3955
04:19:47,420 --> 04:19:48,620
All right, more intelligence.

3956
04:19:49,520 --> 04:19:50,380
All right, there we go.

3957
04:19:51,040 --> 04:19:53,140
I believe in depressed, the Phenomenon.

3958
04:19:55,140 --> 04:19:55,980
Okay, let's start.

3959
04:19:56,080 --> 04:19:57,800
What is my favorite game?

3960
04:19:58,420 --> 04:19:59,440
The Wolf Within Us?

3961
04:20:00,200 --> 04:20:02,700
I don't know, fucking old-brainy 1949.

3962
04:20:03,420 --> 04:20:04,840
The wolves have eyes.

3963
04:20:04,960 --> 04:20:06,440
The wolves inside us.

3964
04:20:07,040 --> 04:20:08,800
Is it the wolves within us?

3965
04:20:09,320 --> 04:20:11,300
That's like the wolves among us, right?

3966
04:20:11,420 --> 04:20:12,800
Or the wolves inside us.

3967
04:20:12,900 --> 04:20:13,660
Inside us?

3968
04:20:14,680 --> 04:20:15,620
That's a... Okay.

3969
04:20:16,300 --> 04:20:17,360
Oh, oh, it's the same.

3970
04:20:17,460 --> 04:20:20,140
What about my... Oh, it's standing alive, right?

3971
04:20:21,220 --> 04:20:22,500
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3972
04:20:23,600 --> 04:20:24,820
Standing alive, right?

3973
04:20:28,140 --> 04:20:29,460
Yeah, it's the bombs.

3974
04:20:31,040 --> 04:20:32,320
I remember the bombs.

3975
04:20:35,060 --> 04:20:36,120
Make a man prime.

3976
04:20:37,060 --> 04:20:37,820
I remember this.

3977
04:20:41,570 --> 04:20:42,610
There you go.

3978
04:20:44,050 --> 04:20:46,050
Yeah, okay, maybe I...

3979
04:20:46,050 --> 04:20:47,050
Okay, anybody.

3980
04:20:47,690 --> 04:20:48,750
Jesus Christ!

3981
04:20:49,010 --> 04:20:49,630
Come and get me.

3982
04:20:50,790 --> 04:20:54,170
I've been waiting downstairs in the lobby for at least 30 minutes.

3983
04:20:54,390 --> 04:20:55,750
What the fuck is wrong with your head?

3984
04:20:55,910 --> 04:20:56,770
There's no skull!

3985
04:20:57,330 --> 04:20:58,470
He has no skull!

3986
04:20:58,730 --> 04:20:59,690
It's just brain!

3987
04:21:00,930 --> 04:21:02,870
Time to freak some fuckers out.

3988
04:21:03,590 --> 04:21:03,930
Alright.

3989
04:21:05,190 --> 04:21:06,230
More intelligence!

3990
04:21:07,470 --> 04:21:09,350
Actually, I don't think I need more intelligence, actually.

3991
04:21:09,350 --> 04:21:11,610
I think we can chill a bit on that.

3992
04:21:12,370 --> 04:21:14,110
I think we can chill a little bit.

3993
04:21:15,170 --> 04:21:17,270
Maybe more intelligence is not the best thing.

3994
04:21:17,530 --> 04:21:17,670
You know what?

3995
04:21:17,670 --> 04:21:18,830
Let's give you intelligence.

3996
04:21:20,350 --> 04:21:21,450
You're my all around it.

3997
04:21:22,510 --> 04:21:23,810
He was the brain teaser.

3998
04:21:26,990 --> 04:21:28,990
Are you aware your entire head is just brain?

3999
04:21:29,050 --> 04:21:33,070
Like, you fucking squish the top of his head and he's dead.

4000
04:21:35,030 --> 04:21:36,010
Like, actually.

4001
04:21:36,330 --> 04:21:39,330
Like, he bumps his head and his fucking entire head.

4002
04:21:39,350 --> 04:22:12,010

It was another one.

4005
04:22:15,190 --> 04:22:16,850
Ooh, it's good with mobility.

4006
04:22:18,910 --> 04:22:20,690
I will put it...

4007
04:22:20,690 --> 04:22:22,410
We'll put...

4008
04:22:23,270 --> 04:22:24,310
We'll give it to her.

4009
04:22:24,730 --> 04:22:25,390
All in.

4010
04:22:26,130 --> 04:22:28,810
All in on her, because she wants to bang me.

4011
04:22:30,470 --> 04:22:31,990
I do have favorites.

4012
04:22:32,670 --> 04:22:34,970

04:24:32,730 --> 04:24:35,290
I swear she just does office work instead.

4031
04:24:35,530 --> 04:25:09,510
Earlier that day, Blazer and I had at the rim of an active volcano then we made love I don't need to hear your sex stories we never had intercourse my alien genitals were not too tired of it it's uh it's not what were you saying she was the only thing I was passionate about her voice her eyes I know why they broke up her whole of her How do you know?

4032
04:25:09,730 --> 04:25:13,250
How do you know she's the only thing you're passionate about if you haven't found anything else you're passionate about?

4033
04:25:14,270 --> 04:25:16,350
Your logic with that statement.

4034
04:25:16,910 --> 04:25:17,730
You have to laugh.

4035
04:25:17,870 --> 04:25:20,330
No, no, what is she dubbed it, bro?

4036
04:25:20,630 --> 04:25:24,990
What you need to do is find the next thing for you to be passionate about.

4037
04:25:26,070 --> 04:25:27,110
Because it's out there.

4038
04:25:28,230 --> 04:25:28,810

4039
04:25:29,190 --> 04:25:31,210

04:25:33,130 --> 04:25:33,770
Oh, is that?

4042
04:25:33,770 --> 04:25:35,750
Oh, this time I will avoid squeezing the blood out.

4043
04:25:35,750 --> 04:25:36,510
Wait, what?

4044
04:25:36,550 --> 04:25:37,770

4045
04:25:40,450 --> 04:25:41,210
Bro!

4046
04:25:42,110 --> 04:25:43,030
Oh, okay.

4047
04:25:45,430 --> 04:25:50,370
I did not realize hugging was his form of intercourse.

4048
04:25:51,310 --> 04:25:55,990
What you watching?

4049
04:25:58,210 --> 04:26:00,330
Technically, you're still on the clock.

4050
04:26:01,170 --> 04:26:03,090
Another HR violation right there.

4051
04:26:03,490 --> 04:26:05,870
On the clock, you shouldn't be pegging me with anything, Robert.

4052
04:26:08,230 --> 04:26:39,090
especially since I'm usually the picker not the peg oh he's definitely a hugger well tell me how it is these ESL turkey don't make fun of him I always forget what I'm watching by the time the movie starts same you going solo I'm a loner Robbie a rebel that night feel bad asking people to pay when I'm just gonna sneak in the only lame thing is I can't get snacks floating buckets of popcorn too tend to draw a lot of attention but I miss it I miss popcorn Just get popcorn.

Oh, shit.

4055
04:26:45,450 --> 04:26:47,170

4058
04:26:53,590 --> 04:26:55,090
Do I want a bad bitch?

4059
04:26:55,250 --> 04:26:56,250

4060
04:26:57,910 --> 04:26:58,490

4061
04:26:59,790 --> 04:27:03,790
Do you want a bad bitch or a muscle mommy?

4062
04:27:04,070 --> 04:27:07,290

04:27:53,790 --> 04:27:55,730

So sad.

4068
04:27:56,910 --> 04:27:58,130
I'm thinking with a super chat.

Pick neither.

4080
04:28:22,130 --> 04:28:24,230

4175
04:35:48,100 --> 04:35:49,060
Can you give me a recap?

4176
04:35:50,580 --> 04:36:13,460
watching like this actually it's illegal for you to be filming i don't need the whole thing just enough to know what's going on okay it's about this struggling actress who gets this big role from a movie star and a mistake the track loads can't be bought democracy one thank you for the super chat parent thank you then he realizes her secret but it turns out he has a secret too which could ruin.

4177
04:36:17,240 --> 04:36:17,520
Oh, shit.

4178
04:36:17,720 --> 04:36:18,600
There's sour patch.

4179
04:36:20,160 --> 04:36:20,640
Hey.

4180
04:36:21,040 --> 04:36:21,880
You didn't hear any of that?

4181
04:36:22,240 --> 04:36:22,460
Yeah.

4182
04:36:23,160 --> 04:36:23,400
No.

4183
04:36:24,180 --> 04:36:25,320
It's probably fine, though.

4184
04:36:27,340 --> 04:36:29,840
So, what are we, like, friends now?

4185
04:36:30,680 --> 04:36:32,580
Or is this some sort of team-building exercise?

4186
04:36:32,820 --> 04:36:33,860
I thought we already were.

4187
04:36:35,820 --> 04:36:38,040
To be fair, I thought we already were.

4188
04:36:38,920 --> 04:36:39,980
Oh, that's embarrassing.

4189
04:36:40,980 --> 04:36:41,360
Oh.

04:36:41,640 --> 04:36:42,780

I just must have bought me for you.

4198
04:36:59,300 --> 04:37:00,080
This is nice.

4199
04:37:00,820 --> 04:37:01,700

Okay, okay, I'm gonna- I won't end it with that.

04:40:07,600 --> 04:40:09,740
I'm- I'm content with ending it with that one.

4228
04:40:12,900 --> 04:40:13,580
That's everybody.

4229
04:40:14,020 --> 04:40:14,400
All clear.

4230
04:40:17,020 --> 04:40:18,060
It's eight episodes.

4231
04:40:21,020 --> 04:40:22,740
One name I will show you how to read.

4232
04:40:23,000 --> 04:40:24,840

I'm a fast-ass runner.

4237
04:40:40,340 --> 04:40:43,180
Why am I not buff for all the exercise I do?

4238
04:40:49,860 --> 04:40:50,960
Damage is done.

4239
04:40:57,100 --> 04:40:59,660
Oh No need to do any more.

04:41:00,220 --> 04:41:01,760

4242
04:41:15,670 --> 04:41:16,510
Oh, that's true.

4243
04:41:16,630 --> 04:41:24,310
He was in a coma forgot about that There's a code of a famous v2 or something my asian map and bananas guys.

4244

4247
04:41:45,640 --> 04:41:47,360
Matt, thank you for the super chat thing.

4248
04:41:47,820 --> 04:41:48,180
Thank you.

4249
04:41:55,400 --> 04:41:57,320
Now he's doing like...

4250
04:41:57,320 --> 04:41:59,980
Now he's putting on... doing muscle gain stuff.

4251
04:42:05,000 --> 04:42:07,380
The 165 with that frame?

4252
04:42:08,820 --> 04:42:10,820
Bro, he doesn't even have a spotter.

4253
04:42:11,120 --> 04:42:13,200
He's so... he's so fucking stupid.

4254
04:42:15,480 --> 04:42:17,700
And this is how you fucking break your chest.

4255
04:42:23,140 --> 04:42:25,320
Yeah, he's like benching solo.

4256
04:42:25,920 --> 04:42:27,800
You're not supposed to live without a spa.

4257
04:42:30,840 --> 04:42:33,120
You do not have superpowers.

4258
04:42:33,240 --> 04:42:33,820
You weak.

4259
04:42:36,340 --> 04:42:40,040
Now I'm getting a safety lecture from a walking fireball.

4260
04:42:40,760 --> 04:42:41,840
It's a reality check.

4261
04:42:42,780 --> 04:42:46,420
Normies need babysitters so you don't hurt yourself thinking you're a hero.

4262
04:42:47,740 --> 04:42:49,800
Man, I am so fucking strong.

4263
04:42:50,800 --> 04:42:51,580
I'm not a normal.

4264
04:42:51,680 --> 04:42:52,720
I'm not normie.

4265
04:42:52,940 --> 04:42:53,900
I watch anime.

4266
04:42:54,840 --> 04:42:57,740
I see a fucking wet white boy put up more on the bench.

4267
04:42:59,000 --> 04:43:00,760
No more hero stuff without supervision.

4268
04:43:01,420 --> 04:43:02,300
You can't get injured.

4269
04:43:02,820 --> 04:43:05,340
Because we need you behind that desk to help real heroes.

4270
04:43:07,220 --> 04:43:11,920
Uh, actually speaking of injuries, remind me, who took your tooth?

4271
04:43:12,520 --> 04:43:12,920
Um.

4272
04:43:13,360 --> 04:43:15,600
It's like they only stole that little bit.

4273
04:43:15,860 --> 04:43:19,380
I got to do a fight with an actual real actual hero.

4274
04:43:19,880 --> 04:43:21,660
And I assure you, he's real.

4275
04:43:21,680 --> 04:43:23,640
regretting his decision to tangle with me.

4276
04:43:25,020 --> 04:43:26,400
I'm into Gundam, okay?

4277
04:43:28,780 --> 04:43:30,340
Bro, this is how he gets his ass.

4278
04:43:30,560 --> 04:43:32,680
And you, it's time for you to accept it.

4279
04:43:32,940 --> 04:43:33,980
You don't got it anymore.

4280
04:43:34,580 --> 04:43:37,840
And pretending you still do is bombing people the fuck out.

4281
04:43:38,800 --> 04:43:41,140
Now, get your flat ass off my bench.

4282
04:43:42,080 --> 04:43:43,260
This is so true.

4283
04:43:43,660 --> 04:43:45,680
Bro, his ass is so fucking flat.

4284
04:43:46,360 --> 04:43:48,040
You know, this squad like that bay.

4285
04:43:50,160 --> 04:43:50,640
Many.

4286
04:43:51,420 --> 04:43:51,660
Oh.

4287
04:43:51,680 --> 04:43:53,880
Aw, look, he got me a gift.

4288
04:43:56,340 --> 04:43:57,360
Bro, it's that bad.

4289
04:43:57,540 --> 04:44:01,620
Bro, you know, you know, he's been squatting for another reason.

4290
04:44:02,820 --> 04:44:05,660
Like, that ass can, like, that ass got kicked.

4291
04:44:10,920 --> 04:44:12,140
Oh, treats are work.

4292
04:44:12,440 --> 04:44:12,740
Damn.

4293
04:44:13,760 --> 04:44:14,060
Already?

4294
04:44:14,280 --> 04:44:18,340
Oh, you ever noticed the Torrance vibe is, like, rancid?

4295
04:44:18,800 --> 04:44:22,940
Between the dead fish in the harbor and the giant refinery, it can't tell who's to blame.

4296
04:44:23,300 --> 04:44:24,280
Dang, that's some nasty.

4297
04:44:25,300 --> 04:44:28,420
Man, I love the smell of the refinery.

4298
04:44:28,960 --> 04:44:30,060
I hate the smell of gasoline.

4299
04:44:30,600 --> 04:44:31,620
I love the smell of gasoline.

4300
04:44:32,440 --> 04:44:33,560
Yeah, we going in.

4301
04:44:33,740 --> 04:44:35,980
We're clocking in for my 9 to 5.

4302
04:44:36,200 --> 04:44:37,360
Who pissed in your cereal?

4303
04:44:37,920 --> 04:44:40,440
Now that's some nasty shit.

4304
04:44:42,280 --> 04:44:43,660
Let's do this.

4305
04:44:43,980 --> 04:44:46,180
Alright, we sent Depression Man in first.

4306
04:44:46,920 --> 04:44:50,020
Torrance Middle School needs judges for our annual talent show.

4307
04:44:50,560 --> 04:44:51,580

Jesus, kid.

4312
04:45:57,200 --> 04:45:57,800
Let's go.

4313
04:45:59,600 --> 04:46:02,460
Isn't this like the third time one of his projects has fallen apart?

4314
04:46:02,920 --> 04:46:04,120
But speed is key.

4315
04:46:04,960 --> 04:46:05,280
Oh, okay.

4316
04:46:05,540 --> 04:46:07,020
We're like...

4317
04:46:07,020 --> 04:46:08,960
We're literally maxed out on speed.

4318
04:46:09,080 --> 04:46:09,840
There's no way.

4319
04:46:11,000 --> 04:46:12,480
Yeah, I was gonna say, we're 10.

4320
04:46:14,380 --> 04:46:15,780
Too bad there's no Grammy for this.

4321
04:46:16,080 --> 04:46:16,880
You monster.

4322
04:46:20,140 --> 04:46:22,850
Oh, it's...

4323
04:46:23,330 --> 04:46:23,770
What's this?

4324
04:46:24,470 --> 04:46:27,910
The parents started fighting over the results and then the kids joined in too.

4325
04:46:28,370 --> 04:46:30,930
Convince them non-violently, please.

4326
04:46:31,410 --> 04:46:31,610
Okay.

4327
04:46:32,590 --> 04:46:34,490
Ah, no, I don't have charisma.

4328
04:46:34,610 --> 04:46:34,810
Okay.

4329
04:46:35,390 --> 04:46:36,730
I can wait a little bit.

4330
04:46:36,830 --> 04:46:37,410
They're resting.

4331
04:46:38,770 --> 04:46:39,330
It's fine.

4332
04:46:40,130 --> 04:46:40,570
Oh, it's this.

4333
04:46:40,910 --> 04:46:47,050
SDN's tolerable and inclusive workplace make you a great sponsor for our aliens and mummies exhibit.

4334
04:46:47,290 --> 04:46:49,410
This looks like a job for Phenomenon.

4335
04:46:50,870 --> 04:46:51,530
Who is me?

4336
04:46:53,330 --> 04:46:56,970
Yeah, but you don't, you don't look like an alien.

4337
04:46:59,450 --> 04:47:00,790
I'm going to send in.

4338
04:47:02,210 --> 04:47:04,650

Oh, shit.

4340
04:47:05,550 --> 04:47:07,150
He's a natural bat right now.

4341
04:47:07,370 --> 04:47:08,290
Okay, that's fine.

4342
04:47:09,110 --> 04:47:09,770
Training time.

4343
04:47:10,730 --> 04:47:11,530

Sounds like a real bop.

4354
04:48:03,010 --> 04:48:04,670
Never say bop again.

4355
04:48:04,790 --> 04:48:05,290
Look at that.

4356
04:48:05,290 --> 04:48:05,510

I don't have smart people in my team.

4364
04:48:20,790 --> 04:48:21,490
I don't know why.

4365
04:48:21,730 --> 04:48:24,890
I think I only have one person in my team that's smart.

4366
04:48:25,270 --> 04:48:26,750
Oh, this is so bad.

4367
04:48:33,500 --> 04:48:34,800

Why did I go all in on the Harvard graduate?

4372
04:48:46,740 --> 04:48:48,060
Is anyone smart?

4373
04:48:48,960 --> 04:48:50,280
Three, three, three.

4374
04:48:50,660 --> 04:48:50,880
Okay.

Gollum?

4462
04:54:47,900 --> 04:54:48,620

4478
04:56:19,960 --> 04:56:22,340
I guess I send in my all-rounder.

4479
04:56:22,420 --> 04:56:23,860

We're so close.

4491
04:58:00,700 --> 04:58:02,320

You did not guide.

4493
04:58:06,960 --> 04:58:09,760

What if he was blue?

4503
04:58:56,780 --> 04:58:57,260

04:59:09,720 --> 04:59:12,520
I'll let you know if I work it out.

4510
04:59:12,520 --> 04:59:13,260
Did it?

4511
04:59:13,640 --> 04:59:14,820
I'm explaining the joke.

4512
04:59:14,920 --> 04:59:15,560
Oh, shit.

4513
04:59:15,800 --> 04:59:16,160
What the fuck?

4514
04:59:16,400 --> 04:59:17,220
Decent reflexes?

4515
04:59:17,360 --> 04:59:17,880
Hey, beef!

4516
04:59:18,120 --> 04:59:18,220
No!

4517
04:59:18,420 --> 04:59:19,440
No, no coffee!

4518
04:59:19,680 --> 04:59:21,820
Do you know that talk too much and have quick reflexes?

4519
04:59:21,920 --> 04:59:22,760
Clean this shit up.

4520
04:59:23,160 --> 04:59:25,600
Hey, losing all that weight don't make you better than us!

4521
04:59:25,860 --> 04:59:26,420
Hey, yeah!

4522
04:59:26,680 --> 04:59:27,560
Shut up, Dad.

4523
04:59:28,480 --> 04:59:29,420
I never had a dad.

4524
04:59:29,800 --> 04:59:30,060
Aw.

4525
04:59:30,240 --> 04:59:30,480
I know.

4526
04:59:30,820 --> 04:59:31,880
Fuck that's supposed to me.

4527
04:59:32,220 --> 04:59:32,720
I mean...

4528
04:59:32,720 --> 04:59:34,360
Told me one time you didn't have a dad.

4529
04:59:35,460 --> 04:59:35,740
Huh.

4530
04:59:36,700 --> 04:59:38,400
I mean, it's sort of obvious a little.

4531
04:59:39,080 --> 04:59:40,980
She definitely looks like she has daddy issues.

4532
04:59:45,760 --> 05:00:13,960
heard the team scuffling with the red ring they run half the crime in the county we were bound to bother them at some point watch yourself you poke the hive you're gonna have to fuck the queen that's not how bees work you know what i mean i don't actually no one's trying to fuck shroud yeah he's a taken man you would do that kill shroud yes you might get the chance you don't want to go in there having to think about it No hesitation.

4533
05:00:16,740 --> 05:00:18,140
Shroud killed him, Chase.

4534
05:00:18,740 --> 05:00:20,120
There's only one thing I can do.

4535
05:00:20,260 --> 05:00:21,020
You know that's not true.

4536
05:00:21,540 --> 05:00:23,260
I'm not sure your dad would want it that way.

4537
05:00:24,160 --> 05:00:24,900
You're not sure.

4538
05:00:25,440 --> 05:00:26,200
Should we ask him?

4539
05:00:26,540 --> 05:00:29,020
Should we ask a dead man that died to him?

4540
05:00:29,900 --> 05:00:31,020
I know Batman!

4541
05:00:32,780 --> 05:00:35,100
Mecha man's coming back to life one patch at a time.

4542
05:00:35,500 --> 05:00:36,500
One patch at a time.

4543
05:00:37,240 --> 05:00:39,100
I mean, Roy's doing most of the work, though, right?

4544
05:00:39,460 --> 05:00:40,400
So much.

4545
05:00:42,620 --> 05:01:13,680
this shit yeah heroes do kill the good ones so maybe if we maybe because we kept letting these villains go we keep having so much crime folks welcome back we got a few guests actually like leading one right now is blue balls man actually like for this business model we shouldn't be killing villains i understand let me we have to let just let them go just so We can have more subscribers.

4546
05:01:13,740 --> 05:01:15,860
Yes, his power is not being able to nut.

4547
05:01:16,040 --> 05:01:17,840
Nah, his balls are literally blue, dude.

4548
05:01:18,260 --> 05:01:19,320
Get your head out of the gutter.

4549
05:01:20,260 --> 05:01:20,360
Great.

4550
05:01:20,800 --> 05:01:21,520
Oh, he's sick.

4551
05:01:21,940 --> 05:01:22,780
Why is Goldham sick?

4552
05:01:22,960 --> 05:01:25,320
Yeah, I'll be out of business if I keep killing villains.

4553
05:01:27,760 --> 05:01:29,020
Mr. Kat is all there.

4554
05:01:29,120 --> 05:01:29,600
It's so scary.

4555
05:01:29,700 --> 05:01:31,000
So please find my boy.

4556
05:01:32,620 --> 05:01:34,560
Because a known escape I was in very fast.

4557
05:01:34,700 --> 05:01:35,980
He hates most people.

4558
05:01:36,100 --> 05:01:37,600
Okay, I have fast here.

4559
05:01:39,560 --> 05:01:40,380
I'll put two.

4560
05:01:42,360 --> 05:01:42,500
Okay.

4561
05:01:44,800 --> 05:01:45,300
What?

4562
05:01:47,820 --> 05:01:47,880
What?

4563
05:01:47,880 --> 05:01:48,880
Did we just lose power?

4564
05:01:49,100 --> 05:01:49,720
What's the fuck?

4565
05:01:49,940 --> 05:01:50,440
What happened?

4566
05:01:51,160 --> 05:01:52,140
Citywide, hang tight.

4567
05:01:52,300 --> 05:01:53,900
We're booting up the backup generator.

4568
05:01:55,740 --> 05:01:57,260
There we go.

4569
05:01:58,260 --> 05:01:58,720
Hey, Robert.

4570
05:01:59,760 --> 05:02:00,480
Just brace yourself.

4571
05:02:00,720 --> 05:02:00,920
What?

4572
05:02:01,720 --> 05:02:02,220
Why?

4573
05:02:03,120 --> 05:02:03,280
Oh.

4574
05:02:04,060 --> 05:02:04,500
Oh.

4575
05:02:04,760 --> 05:02:04,980
Oh.

4576
05:02:05,640 --> 05:02:06,880
There's going to be a lot.

4577
05:02:08,140 --> 05:02:11,140
A lot of people are going to ask for help now.

4578
05:02:12,520 --> 05:02:45,060
close your eyes before yeah same i mean i can see in the dark so this is pretty standard for me all right you guys the whole city's out guys this is an all hands-on situation okay i'm gonna get a grid back up and running be ready oh there's gonna be a lot of stuff yeah there's gonna be a lot of people some real action oh okay lots of hacking now restart the power okay it says low difficulty but last time someone tricked me about that Okay,

4579
05:02:45,140 --> 05:02:46,640
I'm not timed, though, which is good.

4580
05:02:47,440 --> 05:02:47,860
Wait, what?

4581
05:02:48,980 --> 05:02:49,680
Oh, okay.

4582
05:02:51,600 --> 05:02:52,120
Oh!

4583
05:02:53,080 --> 05:02:54,600
Okay, I get it.

4584
05:02:57,040 --> 05:02:59,400
Okay, I'm, like, funneling energy back to people.

4585
05:03:03,820 --> 05:03:04,280
Okay.

4586
05:03:08,760 --> 05:03:10,000
Oh, I see.

4587
05:03:10,100 --> 05:03:11,640
Oh, this is smart.

4588
05:03:17,360 --> 05:03:19,180
Okay, I think I have to do this one.

4589
05:03:22,970 --> 05:03:26,290
Okay, and then I grab energy here.

4590
05:03:29,190 --> 05:03:30,210
Oh, I like this.

4591
05:03:30,350 --> 05:03:31,470
This is a neat concept.

4592
05:03:32,130 --> 05:03:34,350
And then I funnel energy here.

4593
05:03:35,610 --> 05:03:37,010
And I grab energy here.

4594
05:03:39,110 --> 05:03:40,550
Mr. Hacker Man.

4595
05:03:41,930 --> 05:03:43,050
And then...

4596
05:03:43,050 --> 05:03:43,390
Bam!

4597
05:03:45,010 --> 05:03:45,550
There you go.

4598
05:03:45,970 --> 05:03:46,990
That's an easy one.

4599
05:03:47,970 --> 05:03:50,390
Yeah, I like how there's a lot of variety in these hacking games.

4600
05:03:50,550 --> 05:03:50,710
Yeah.

4601
05:03:52,530 --> 05:03:55,690
I've lost contact with the tower and it's pitch black out here.

4602
05:03:55,850 --> 05:03:59,770
I cannot land this thing help Oh, don't worry.

4603
05:04:00,010 --> 05:04:02,850
It's the plane on the ground Sounds dangerous.

4604
05:04:03,070 --> 05:04:03,790
I got flyers.

4605
05:04:03,790 --> 05:04:05,350
You guys can handle it.

4606
05:04:05,630 --> 05:04:09,310
Oh Oh Oh, never mind.

4607
05:04:09,450 --> 05:04:10,410
I don't got flyers

4608
05:04:14,970 --> 05:04:20,490
You're hurt, but oh yeah, you're you're so hurt wait actually I got you

4609
05:04:23,790 --> 05:04:24,430
You know what?

4610
05:04:24,450 --> 05:04:24,630
What?

4611
05:04:25,850 --> 05:04:26,670
All in.

4612
05:04:27,810 --> 05:04:28,510
Also healing.

4613
05:04:29,530 --> 05:04:30,730
What's a hell of a deal?

4614
05:04:31,310 --> 05:04:31,730
It's fine.

4615
05:04:32,350 --> 05:04:33,590
We don't need flyers.

4616
05:04:33,830 --> 05:04:34,570
They cannot fly.

4617
05:04:35,070 --> 05:04:36,790
And yet they are- Oh, there was a choice?

4618
05:04:37,450 --> 05:04:37,750
It's fine.

4619
05:04:38,070 --> 05:04:38,790
Drang fucking slaps.

4620
05:04:39,510 --> 05:04:40,390
Can you blame them for Drang?

4621
05:04:41,370 --> 05:04:47,190
But their feeble bodies were meant for gentler activities, such as walking and- Uh-oh.

4622
05:04:47,190 --> 05:04:47,690
I knew it.

4623
05:04:47,690 --> 05:04:48,050
There you go.

4624
05:04:48,150 --> 05:04:48,810
Open pointer.

4625
05:04:49,110 --> 05:04:50,350
Yeah, exactly.

4626
05:04:50,530 --> 05:04:51,490
I told you guys.

4627
05:04:52,310 --> 05:04:52,970
The danger.

4628
05:04:52,970 --> 05:04:55,210
I don't need no flyers.

4629
05:04:55,210 --> 05:04:59,510
I suppose their futile efforts to become more than they are is admirable.

4630
05:05:01,390 --> 05:05:02,850
Okay, my mother lives in the senior community.

4631
05:05:02,950 --> 05:05:04,170
She hasn't answered the phone.

4632
05:05:04,630 --> 05:05:05,110
Go door.

4633
05:05:05,510 --> 05:05:08,170
Be sure to be prepared to provide medical assistance.

4634
05:05:08,830 --> 05:05:10,270
I think she can do that.

4635
05:05:10,550 --> 05:05:10,990
Wait, okay.

4636
05:05:11,250 --> 05:05:11,430
What?

4637
05:05:11,650 --> 05:05:14,330
Oh, I don't know.

4638
05:05:14,670 --> 05:05:15,690
I'll think about it.

4639
05:05:15,730 --> 05:05:16,810
Actually, I think...

4640
05:05:16,810 --> 05:05:18,170
My mother lives in the Parkwood senior community.

4641
05:05:18,710 --> 05:05:19,970
And she hasn't answered her phone.

4642
05:05:19,970 --> 05:05:20,370
There we go.

4643
05:05:20,370 --> 05:05:21,130
All around there.

4644
05:05:21,910 --> 05:05:22,670
There we go.

4645
05:05:22,970 --> 05:05:24,070
Love me.

4646
05:05:24,170 --> 05:05:26,070
Yeah, I know the elderly love you.

4647
05:05:26,150 --> 05:05:26,830
Your depression!

4648
05:05:27,510 --> 05:05:29,050
They see you and they'll be less depressed.

4649
05:05:29,230 --> 05:05:30,130
Can you lend a hand?

4650
05:05:30,770 --> 05:05:31,250
Preferably a stronger.

4651
05:05:31,270 --> 05:05:33,170
Any delays will cause another explosion?

4652
05:05:33,810 --> 05:05:35,150
Oh shit.

4653
05:05:35,850 --> 05:05:37,410
Oh shit.

4654
05:05:37,950 --> 05:05:38,950
Oh god.

4655
05:05:41,250 --> 05:05:43,790
Okay, we'll think about that later.

4656
05:05:47,130 --> 05:05:47,650
Hello.

4657
05:05:48,370 --> 05:05:50,430
My baby brother ate my mommy and dad.

4658
05:05:50,450 --> 05:05:50,770
Huh?

4659
05:05:53,090 --> 05:06:22,210

4660
05:06:22,330 --> 05:06:22,870
I believe in her.

4661
05:06:23,110 --> 05:06:23,670
I believe in her.

4662
05:06:24,690 --> 05:06:26,430
Mostly, like, bad shit, though.

4663
05:06:27,610 --> 05:06:28,170
God damn it.

4664
05:06:28,290 --> 05:06:30,090
The red ring stealing shipments right off the train.

4665
05:06:30,690 --> 05:06:31,850
We're not equipped to stop them.

4666
05:06:32,290 --> 05:06:32,750
Red ring?

4667
05:06:33,370 --> 05:06:33,830
Fuck him up.

4668
05:06:33,830 --> 05:06:36,350
We just gotta do all- okay, I can't- I have an idea.

4669
05:06:37,510 --> 05:06:38,050
Go there!

4670
05:06:38,330 --> 05:06:38,510
Oh.

4671
05:06:39,330 --> 05:06:40,710
What's it gonna be this time?

4672
05:06:43,890 --> 05:06:44,650
Okay, her.

4673
05:06:45,110 --> 05:06:47,110
I'll crack some skulls.

4674
05:06:51,540 --> 05:06:52,320
Yeah, it's fine.

4675
05:06:53,100 --> 05:06:54,940
Like, dark and shit out here.

4676
05:06:55,520 --> 05:06:55,560
Uh.

4677
05:06:59,260 --> 05:07:01,940
Uh, okay, we'll see what we get here.

4678
05:07:05,160 --> 05:07:05,480
Nice.

4679
05:07:05,940 --> 05:07:06,640
I knew it.

4680
05:07:06,820 --> 05:07:08,120
I've always believed.

4681
05:07:09,520 --> 05:07:09,960
Okay.

4682
05:07:11,440 --> 05:07:13,680
Secure defeat the red goons.

4683
05:07:14,540 --> 05:07:16,160
Okay, depression, man.

4684
05:07:18,000 --> 05:07:18,300
Mal.

4685
05:07:18,840 --> 05:07:19,520
I know a secret.

4686
05:07:19,820 --> 05:07:20,020
What?

4687
05:07:20,580 --> 05:07:21,420
Would you kind of keep it?

4688
05:07:23,100 --> 05:07:23,800
Oh, shit.

4689
05:07:24,040 --> 05:07:24,580
Wait, yeah.

4690
05:07:24,720 --> 05:07:25,120
Let's go.

4691
05:07:25,400 --> 05:07:26,580
I don't need to keep a secret.

4692
05:07:27,540 --> 05:07:27,760
Alright.

4693
05:07:28,560 --> 05:07:31,880
Strangely, that's not the first time I've heard that.

4694
05:07:34,620 --> 05:07:37,420
Alright, at least the hacking is not timed this time, for real.

4695
05:07:39,740 --> 05:07:41,720
I think I use my brain.

4696
05:07:43,580 --> 05:07:44,620
Alright, here.

4697
05:07:45,320 --> 05:07:47,040
We'll grab the passcode.

4698
05:07:47,420 --> 05:07:48,000
Alright, guys.

4699
05:07:48,480 --> 05:07:49,680
Remember this passcode.

4700
05:07:50,320 --> 05:07:52,020
Up, down, up, left, right.

4701
05:07:53,780 --> 05:07:55,220

05:07:55,440 --> 05:07:57,860
Okay, and then put it here.

05:07:59,320 --> 05:08:00,440
Up left, right.

4704
05:08:02,020 --> 05:08:07,680
And then grab this.

4705
05:08:10,140 --> 05:08:10,500
There you go.

There you go.

4709
05:08:16,300 --> 05:08:16,700
Easy.

4710
05:08:18,440 --> 05:08:19,920

4717
05:10:30,700 --> 05:10:33,720
We've got a situation at Ben Labs.

4718
05:10:34,140 --> 05:10:35,480
They told me to call SDN.

4719
05:10:35,660 --> 05:10:36,540

4725
05:10:50,180 --> 05:10:51,400
They're depressed again?

4726
05:10:52,080 --> 05:10:52,500
Again.

4727
05:10:53,840 --> 05:10:56,380

05:11:30,300 --> 05:11:30,680

Alright, we got that.

4732
05:11:36,580 --> 05:11:37,820
Oh, no.

4733
05:11:38,420 --> 05:11:40,580
Why don't we have backup generator city?

4734
05:11:40,780 --> 05:11:42,820
What's the taxpayers' money for?

4735
05:11:43,460 --> 05:11:43,800
Okay.

4736
05:11:46,040 --> 05:11:46,520
Okay.

4737
05:11:47,860 --> 05:11:48,680
It's fine.

4738
05:11:50,800 --> 05:11:51,520
Oh?

4739
05:11:56,640 --> 05:11:57,760
What the fuck happened?

4740
05:11:57,920 --> 05:11:59,440
Oh, did I destroy it?

4741
05:11:59,640 --> 05:11:59,940
Oh!

4742
05:12:01,840 --> 05:12:02,560
That's right!

4743
05:12:02,840 --> 05:12:03,900
Get out of here!

4744
05:12:07,500 --> 05:12:08,420
Get out of here!

4745
05:12:08,800 --> 05:12:09,220
Zap zap!

4746
05:12:11,940 --> 05:12:13,040
Nearly there.

4747
05:12:14,900 --> 05:12:15,260
Okay.

4748
05:12:18,520 --> 05:12:19,040
Let's just go.

4749
05:12:19,260 --> 05:12:20,460
Okay, we gotta do this.

4750
05:12:22,760 --> 05:12:25,080
All right, it shocked him.

4751
05:12:27,720 --> 05:12:28,240
Zap zap!

4752
05:12:31,820 --> 05:12:32,560
All right.

4753
05:12:34,900 --> 05:12:35,960
I don't need a wait.

4754
05:12:37,220 --> 05:12:38,400
What did you do?

4755
05:12:39,060 --> 05:12:44,860
Is that XP or whatever can reveal number of slots and crime types on hover for certain cause before they happen?

4756
05:12:44,980 --> 05:12:46,620
No, I'll just grab the double XP.

4757
05:12:46,740 --> 05:12:48,440
I think double XP seems a lot better.

4758
05:12:49,880 --> 05:12:53,320
We've got several looting's in progress and our guys are getting overwhelmed.

4759
05:12:54,700 --> 05:12:55,180
Looting?

4760
05:12:55,220 --> 05:12:56,480
I had a team in...

4761
05:12:56,480 --> 05:12:57,180
Oh, basic.

4762
05:12:57,400 --> 05:12:59,260
Assisting and evacuating.

4763
05:12:59,460 --> 05:13:00,240
I'm robbing banks.

4764
05:13:02,720 --> 05:13:04,560
originality Shut up.

4765
05:13:04,620 --> 05:13:09,220
It's like the go-to blackout activity and besides burning all those shitty candles your aunties.

4766
05:13:09,220 --> 05:13:12,440
I don't know what apprehend the thieves Do I need to be fast?

4767
05:13:12,700 --> 05:13:16,480
I was thinking I'll just be fast unless We could double yeah, you know what?

4768
05:13:16,940 --> 05:13:22,360
All right, that's five Jesus Christ

4769
05:13:25,720 --> 05:13:28,580
Oh, yeah, fuck me I guess okay chair.

4770
05:13:28,980 --> 05:13:29,200
Yeah, man.

4771
05:13:29,280 --> 05:13:30,620
I got a bad headache right now.

4772
05:13:30,760 --> 05:13:32,500
It's that's why it's I was a little bit.

4773
05:13:33,620 --> 05:13:35,340
Why did it send intelligence?

4774
05:13:43,970 --> 05:13:45,410
I'll take care of it.

4775
05:13:45,770 --> 05:13:46,490
There we go.

4776
05:13:47,490 --> 05:13:49,510
There's no way I need any intellect for this.

4777
05:13:51,290 --> 05:13:52,310
There's no way.

4778
05:13:52,330 --> 05:13:54,210
Can I at least keep the guys responsible?

4779
05:13:54,790 --> 05:13:55,730
There's no way.

4780
05:13:57,290 --> 05:13:59,610
There's no way I need any brains for this.

4781
05:13:59,850 --> 05:14:00,770
I swear to God.

4782
05:14:00,870 --> 05:14:01,390
Oh, God.

4783
05:14:01,650 --> 05:14:02,070
Come on.

4784
05:14:02,190 --> 05:14:02,710
Sonar.

4785
05:14:04,210 --> 05:14:05,810
And Phenomenal, I'm sorry.

4786
05:14:05,870 --> 05:14:07,110
It was fucking depressed.

4787
05:14:07,190 --> 05:14:08,070
I'm fighting him.

4788
05:14:08,090 --> 05:14:08,390
I have 10.

4789
05:14:08,390 --> 05:14:09,410
You don't even need to say it.

4790
05:14:09,770 --> 05:14:11,230
Fuck these guys up.

4791
05:14:12,850 --> 05:14:13,650
There's no way.

4792
05:14:13,710 --> 05:14:15,270
I was gonna say, I have 10.

4793
05:14:16,850 --> 05:14:18,630
I went all in on combat.

4794
05:14:26,220 --> 05:14:27,980
Yeah, I'm making you an all-rounder.

4795
05:14:30,580 --> 05:14:33,820
I have too many stupid people on my team.

4796
05:14:34,280 --> 05:14:38,040
I can't rely all on him because sometimes he changes to a dumb guy.

4797
05:14:40,220 --> 05:14:41,320
Search and rescue.

4798
05:14:41,400 --> 05:14:43,080
I don't know what search and rescue would be.

4799
05:14:43,440 --> 05:14:44,340
That's the thing.

4800
05:14:47,860 --> 05:14:49,040
Okay, thank God.

4801
05:14:49,760 --> 05:14:50,880
10, 10, 10.

4802
05:14:51,500 --> 05:14:53,040
You sure we don't work on commission?

4803
05:14:54,600 --> 05:14:55,360
Wait for Mel?

4804
05:14:59,240 --> 05:15:00,480
She's slowly returning.

4805
05:15:00,760 --> 05:15:02,420
Oh, there's so many people.

4806
05:15:02,440 --> 05:15:04,260
My daughter was at the beach with her friends.

4807
05:15:04,460 --> 05:15:05,620
And I haven't heard from her.

4808
05:15:05,740 --> 05:15:06,800
I'm really worried.

4809
05:15:08,480 --> 05:15:08,960
Uh...

4810
05:15:11,600 --> 05:15:12,620
We'll do him.

4811
05:15:12,660 --> 05:15:14,920
You are quite an intimidating specimen.

4812
05:15:15,000 --> 05:15:15,020
Oh, God.

4813
05:15:15,320 --> 05:15:15,320
Okay.

4814
05:15:15,340 --> 05:15:16,200
On the outside.

4815
05:15:16,900 --> 05:15:17,720
Sobred on the inside.

4816
05:15:18,580 --> 05:15:21,180
I believe that is how all life forms are.

4817
05:15:21,440 --> 05:15:23,040
Yeah, I meant like metaphorical.

4818
05:15:23,040 --> 05:15:23,840
I messed up.

4819
05:15:24,440 --> 05:15:25,480
A metaphorical dog.

4820
05:15:26,340 --> 05:15:26,580
Where?

4821
05:15:29,080 --> 05:15:30,380
Fresh as a daisy.

4822
05:15:35,400 --> 05:15:37,480
You don't need to see shit to punch shit.

4823
05:15:38,400 --> 05:15:38,720
Oh.

4824
05:15:42,860 --> 05:15:43,780
It's fine.

4825
05:15:44,540 --> 05:15:45,440
Everything's fine.

4826
05:15:46,320 --> 05:15:46,960
It's fine.

4827
05:15:47,120 --> 05:15:48,680
I'm putting more intelligence in here.

4828
05:15:49,080 --> 05:15:50,940
I need more smart people on my team.

4829
05:15:52,320 --> 05:15:52,900
It's fine.

4830
05:15:53,100 --> 05:15:55,320
Those fences are at it again with their ebikes and fireworks.

4831
05:15:58,280 --> 05:15:59,020
I have time.

4832
05:16:00,180 --> 05:16:01,440
I can get Prism in here.

4833
05:16:05,140 --> 05:16:05,620
Yeah.

4834
05:16:06,080 --> 05:16:06,300
Okay.

4835
05:16:07,320 --> 05:16:08,060
Hey, girl.

4836
05:16:08,800 --> 05:16:10,080
And we have synergy, too.

4837
05:16:10,300 --> 05:16:11,900
I think this shift gave me carpal tunnel.

4838
05:16:12,320 --> 05:16:12,880
See, look at that.

4839
05:16:13,560 --> 05:16:13,920
Oh, okay.

4840
05:16:14,100 --> 05:16:14,300
Oh.

4841
05:16:14,400 --> 05:16:16,180
Um, where should we search, guys?

4842
05:16:16,400 --> 05:16:17,420
Probably a combo type deal.

4843
05:16:17,540 --> 05:16:18,020
I chat.

4844
05:16:21,340 --> 05:16:24,240
Search the pier, beach, or what?

4845
05:16:24,260 --> 05:16:25,620
Oh, yeah, thank God he's normal, too.

4846
05:16:26,220 --> 05:16:26,300
Water?

4847
05:16:30,790 --> 05:16:31,890
No sign of them?

4848
05:16:32,070 --> 05:16:33,210
Where else should we go?

4849
05:16:34,310 --> 05:16:34,730
Beach.

4850
05:16:38,740 --> 05:16:39,180
Oh.

4851
05:16:43,070 --> 05:16:44,010
He could.

4852
05:16:44,150 --> 05:16:44,890
Oh, my God.

4853
05:16:44,990 --> 05:16:47,690
It was intelligence and charisma.

4854
05:16:48,550 --> 05:16:49,930
Are you fucking...

4855
05:16:49,950 --> 05:17:19,290

See, combat.

4858
05:17:55,990 --> 05:17:57,950
Oh, I'll put you in combat.

4859
05:18:01,110 --> 05:18:02,610
I can't go on.

4860
05:18:03,290 --> 05:18:04,030
Not like this.

4861
05:18:04,030 --> 05:18:05,910
Just because a couple of teenagers made...

4862
05:18:05,910 --> 05:18:06,670
Oh, no, that's true.

4863
05:18:06,830 --> 05:18:07,350
No, never mind.

4864
05:18:07,410 --> 05:18:08,270
No, it's understandable.

4865
05:18:09,270 --> 05:18:11,190
No, teenagers are really mean people.

4866
05:18:11,330 --> 05:18:12,210
No, I get it.

4867
05:18:13,770 --> 05:18:15,550
I get it.

4868
05:18:20,960 --> 05:18:22,920
Why no more combat?

4869
05:18:23,760 --> 05:18:24,740
I'm calling.

4870
05:18:25,800 --> 05:18:26,180
Nothing.

4871
05:18:26,360 --> 05:18:27,560
It's up combat.

4872
05:18:28,980 --> 05:18:30,860
Imagine more combat.

4873
05:18:33,520 --> 05:18:35,140
Kids are cruel.

4874
05:18:35,560 --> 05:18:36,360
They're so mean.

4875
05:18:41,800 --> 05:18:43,820
Bring your heel back from down.

4876
05:18:44,060 --> 05:18:44,420
Oh, nice.

4877
05:18:44,680 --> 05:18:45,900
Wait, they never really...

4878
05:18:45,900 --> 05:18:48,700
Oh, I guess I can bring him back from depression.

4879
05:18:50,660 --> 05:18:50,920
Charisma.

4880
05:18:51,720 --> 05:18:53,000
He needs more charisma.

4881
05:18:59,510 --> 05:19:00,090
Maybe...

4882
05:19:00,790 --> 05:19:01,370
Maybe...

4883
05:19:01,490 --> 05:19:02,270
That's right.

4884
05:19:02,470 --> 05:19:03,330
More charisma.

4885
05:19:12,960 --> 05:19:13,780
Anyone but sonar.

4886
05:19:14,040 --> 05:19:15,360
Oppo, give it to sonar.

4887
05:19:16,140 --> 05:19:17,660
Good week, everybody.

4888
05:19:18,180 --> 05:19:18,920
See you all on Monday.

4889
05:19:25,100 --> 05:19:27,160
I mean, the Sardine's a villain bar.

4890
05:19:27,240 --> 05:19:28,500
Not sure I'd fit in.

4891
05:19:28,580 --> 05:19:29,740
Just go dress like that.

4892
05:19:30,040 --> 05:19:31,980
Everyone will just think you're a pervert.

4893
05:19:33,220 --> 05:19:33,560
What?

4894
05:19:36,660 --> 05:19:37,960
Yeah, um, good.

4895
05:19:38,340 --> 05:19:38,780
Oh,

4896
05:19:44,870 --> 05:19:45,270
we're hitting it.

4897
05:19:45,290 --> 05:20:47,350
with the boys let's go oh this looks like a a very non-villain bar oh look he has his airpods on damn big oh you want to drink you want to sure oh that sucks for him hey creep creep i don't know you and i don't like not knowing people well you won't like knowing him he's the biggest perv and he's with us she's joking I'm not my business but if you do go jerking off in the bathroom oh shit make it my business that's I don't want to be in that business is this a villain bar the fuck are we the villain bar after being heroes is there no hero bar no there is a hero bar I guess it'd be cheaper too.

4898
05:20:47,930 --> 05:20:50,050
I feel like also it's that's so stupid.

4899
05:20:50,330 --> 05:20:51,250
Why the fuck are they here so?

4900
05:20:52,190 --> 05:20:53,690
Can they not just get arrested?

4901
05:20:54,270 --> 05:20:57,990
I guess they need a warrant to be in the villain bar.

4902
05:21:03,860 --> 05:21:04,500
Buy me a drink.

4903
05:21:05,680 --> 05:21:09,020
Oh, yeah, no, but my but they don't know my secret identity.

4904
05:21:09,600 --> 05:21:10,520
I have my shower patch kids on our first date.

4905
05:21:10,720 --> 05:21:12,540
I figure whiskey makes sense for the second.

4906
05:21:12,960 --> 05:21:14,000
She called it a day.

4907
05:21:14,400 --> 05:21:14,740
You can buy me dinner.

4908
05:21:15,560 --> 05:21:16,080
Nothing too far.

4909
05:21:16,080 --> 05:21:16,960
I had a good time.

4910
05:21:17,740 --> 05:21:19,600
I hadn't been to the movies in a while.

4911
05:21:19,720 --> 05:21:20,560
I had a good time.

4912
05:21:21,360 --> 05:21:24,820
I had a good time eating popcorn too loud while I sat silently next to you.

4913
05:21:25,480 --> 05:21:27,200
The silence was the best part.

4914
05:21:27,600 --> 05:21:28,500
I forgot if that baby got banned.

4915
05:21:28,500 --> 05:21:29,540
You might like it loud sometime.

4916
05:21:32,480 --> 05:21:34,040
Was that about sex?

4917
05:21:34,620 --> 05:21:35,480
Catch on quick.

4918
05:21:36,260 --> 05:21:37,240
I'll grab us a table.

4919
05:21:37,720 --> 05:21:42,580
Yeah, because I was saying a Mega Man got banned, but not Robert Robertson.

4920
05:21:43,420 --> 05:21:44,040
Make it three.

4921
05:21:45,120 --> 05:21:45,520
Four.

4922
05:21:45,960 --> 05:21:47,620
Oh my god, bitch, you black forever.

4923
05:21:47,720 --> 05:21:54,080
This I recognize the bar Shitty whiskies we should have avoided him earlier.

4924
05:21:54,080 --> 05:21:55,480
He thought he was a fucking man.

4925
05:21:55,780 --> 05:22:04,620
I recognize this bar that he reminded me of my ex and he's got buzzkill ass energy Been doing this live how long have you been going out like this since day one?

4926
05:22:04,960 --> 05:22:10,220
Don't act surprised you were the bad guy until Wait, when did we decide you wasn't the bad guy?

4927
05:22:10,240 --> 05:22:10,820
Yeah, when did we decide?

4928
05:22:14,420 --> 05:22:43,120

4930
05:22:59,120 --> 05:22:59,580
No problem.

4931
05:22:59,960 --> 05:23:03,400
You're going to win 2025 early of the year, bro.

4932
05:23:03,600 --> 05:23:05,520
He came at that outside.

4933
05:23:08,080 --> 05:23:08,720
Fine.

4934
05:23:09,200 --> 05:23:13,840
Bro, we're got, you're going to break the cycle.

4935
05:23:23,120 --> 05:23:26,260
We need him to break the cycle, guys.

4936
05:23:32,570 --> 05:23:33,370
Oh, shit.

4937
05:23:35,910 --> 05:23:36,810
Everyone thinks I'm a narc.

4938
05:23:37,950 --> 05:23:39,650
They can still smell the hero on you.

4939
05:23:40,170 --> 05:23:40,670
You're the enemy.

4940
05:23:40,830 --> 05:23:42,070
What about depression, then?

4941
05:23:42,310 --> 05:23:43,010
What else do they want?

4942
05:23:43,810 --> 05:23:44,770
You can buy him drinks.

4943
05:23:45,270 --> 05:23:46,970
You can make sure they don't get fired.

4944
05:23:47,670 --> 05:23:52,650
You can line him up and blow him one by one, but they're still gonna think you might be the hero that fucked up their life.

4945
05:23:53,530 --> 05:23:54,850
People don't think about much when I...

4946
05:23:54,870 --> 05:24:11,750
eye blown but i hear what you're saying though i had argued they fucked up their own lives being criminals see that snark just tell him he's a loser he's a loser so it's fine bro oh

4947
05:24:34,420 --> 05:24:39,600

4948
05:24:51,030 --> 05:24:52,510
I'm not done with you, yeah.

4949
05:24:52,550 --> 05:24:53,350
I'm just getting warmed up.

4950
05:25:03,100 --> 05:25:03,420
Oh,

4951
05:25:13,620 --> 05:25:14,880

4952
05:25:15,100 --> 05:25:16,680
Dude, that's flammable, bro.

4953
05:25:34,020 --> 05:25:34,960
Oh, shit.

4954
05:25:35,660 --> 05:25:36,180
Oh.

4955
05:25:37,000 --> 05:25:38,280
I'm a bitch.

4956
05:25:38,420 --> 05:25:39,220
My name's Rama.

4957
05:25:39,520 --> 05:25:40,400
Suck your bitch.

4958
05:25:40,660 --> 05:25:41,480
Whose name is Rama.

4959
05:25:41,480 --> 05:25:43,220
Oh, I didn't even notice that.

4960
05:25:43,460 --> 05:25:44,020
I'm a bitch.

4961
05:25:44,640 --> 05:25:46,340
I'm such a fucking bitch.

4962
05:25:46,540 --> 05:26:06,240
I have no hopes, I have no dreams It's Annie Little P And it doesn't even function anyway Because I have your act of dysfunction It's so catchy, guys I thought they lost it working in a deli or something And there was this incident in crypto Where he was fucking with me And I kind of...

4963
05:26:06,240 --> 05:26:18,040
I've been dealing with that wistly-ass tooth Because of you Well, it was self-inflicted But I'm not sure he'll see it that way So you can see I'm worried about getting incinerated.

4964
05:26:18,200 --> 05:26:19,160
That's how catchy it is.

4965
05:26:19,280 --> 05:26:20,100
Oh, yeah, because he doesn't know.

4966
05:26:20,320 --> 05:26:20,700
He used to be.

4967
05:26:21,400 --> 05:26:22,160
He doesn't know it's mechamand.

4968
05:26:22,160 --> 05:26:23,100
He doesn't know it's mechamand.

4969
05:26:23,100 --> 05:26:23,860
Sooner we get a fresh start.

4970
05:26:24,580 --> 05:26:26,540
You heard me when I said incinerated, right?

4971
05:26:26,760 --> 05:26:29,840
Who let a loser ass bitch of a hero into our supervillain bar?

4972
05:26:30,920 --> 05:26:32,140
Why is everyone?

4973
05:26:33,120 --> 05:26:34,220
Do I look like a bitch?

4974
05:26:34,800 --> 05:26:35,920
Don't answer that.

4975
05:26:36,480 --> 05:26:36,760
Fuck.

4976
05:26:37,160 --> 05:26:37,940

05:26:38,260 --> 05:26:39,660
He's got big guy voice.

4978
05:26:40,100 --> 05:26:41,540
Some parts of him are big.

4979
05:26:41,860 --> 05:26:44,580
From now on, team drinks are exclusively at Chili's.

4980
05:26:44,860 --> 05:26:46,200

You're heroes now.

5023
05:31:06,970 --> 05:31:08,090
Heroes don't start fights.

5024
05:31:08,930 --> 05:31:09,790
You finish them.

5025
05:31:10,350 --> 05:31:10,430

05:31:13,850 --> 05:31:15,630
Well, not many finished fights against the Red Ring.

5028
05:31:16,030 --> 05:31:18,130
Yeah, how do you have beef with them, Mr. Dispatcher?

5029
05:31:18,570 --> 05:31:20,410
Yeah, we know this Robert guy is affluent.

5030
05:31:21,370 --> 05:31:21,850
Who are you?

5031
05:31:22,070 --> 05:31:22,430
Really?

5032
05:31:24,370 --> 05:31:25,290
I'm Robert.

5033
05:31:25,770 --> 05:31:26,930
It's a rare thing in life.

5034
05:31:27,490 --> 05:31:29,470
You know, fresh start, clean slate.

5035
05:31:30,090 --> 05:31:35,550
You all know, every room you walk into, your reputation proceeds.

5036
05:31:36,750 --> 05:31:40,110
I walked into SDN, and suddenly I was me.

5037
05:31:40,370 --> 05:31:41,890
It was just me.

5038
05:31:42,210 --> 05:31:43,390
Big decision!

5039
05:31:43,810 --> 05:31:44,530
I'm Robbie.

5040
05:31:45,010 --> 05:31:49,170
I'm not sure if you were five years ago, two months ago, yesterday.

5041
05:31:51,110 --> 05:31:52,850
No, I saw the other options.

5042
05:31:53,090 --> 05:31:54,150
I just want to be Robbie.

5043
05:31:54,550 --> 05:31:56,730
Right now, I'm Robert.

5044
05:31:57,730 --> 05:31:59,110
Toki, no.

5045
05:31:59,270 --> 05:32:00,070
That was it.

5046
05:32:00,090 --> 05:32:03,110
That was a big decision.

5047
05:32:03,370 --> 05:32:04,450
It's a mind game.

5048
05:32:04,570 --> 05:32:05,570
A ticking tactic.

5049
05:32:06,350 --> 05:32:06,670
Who are you?

5050
05:32:06,950 --> 05:32:08,390
I just told you.

5051
05:32:08,750 --> 05:32:09,990
You're the heroes now.

5052
05:32:10,230 --> 05:32:10,370
What?

5053
05:32:10,650 --> 05:32:11,590
What do you mean?

5054
05:32:11,730 --> 05:32:14,530
It was the first thing I went instinct.

5055
05:32:14,830 --> 05:32:15,470
What's your problem?

5056
05:32:15,810 --> 05:32:19,830
I don't like not knowing things that might make me mad if I knew them.

5057
05:32:20,490 --> 05:32:21,210
I'm Robin.

5058
05:32:21,630 --> 05:32:22,790
Just let it go, bro.

5059
05:32:22,990 --> 05:32:23,730
Be free.

5060
05:32:24,550 --> 05:32:25,030
I did.

5061
05:32:25,110 --> 05:32:26,690
It was Mega Man and Robin.

5062
05:32:27,450 --> 05:32:28,910
And I was like, I'm Robin.

5063
05:32:32,050 --> 05:33:30,290

I like how everyone's like, biggest decision right now!

5065
05:33:32,670 --> 05:33:33,790
And I'm like, I'm Robbie.

5066
05:33:37,370 --> 05:33:37,930
Whoops.

5067
05:33:39,930 --> 05:33:41,670
I just want to be Robbie.

5068
05:33:45,850 --> 05:33:46,890
Look, see?

5069
05:33:47,410 --> 05:33:49,230
Everyone's happy, guys.

5070
05:33:50,110 --> 05:33:51,610
Everyone's so happy.

5071
05:33:52,450 --> 05:33:55,590
I don't,

5072
05:34:06,680 --> 05:34:08,360
I don't, I don't, I don't.

5073
05:34:09,940 --> 05:34:11,600
Sounds like hip-hop, but it's not.

5074
05:34:11,980 --> 05:34:12,100
Yeah.

5075
05:34:15,700 --> 05:34:16,960
It's like a run DMC.

5076
05:34:17,160 --> 05:34:19,160
You know, they came through a wall, but there's a different song.

5077
05:34:20,100 --> 05:34:21,760
I hate the world today.

5078
05:34:23,140 --> 05:34:24,500
You're so good to me.

5079
05:34:24,780 --> 05:34:26,500
I know that I can change.

5080
05:34:26,660 --> 05:34:27,460
I can't change.

5081
05:34:27,640 --> 05:34:28,420
Yeah, you can change.

5082
05:34:28,460 --> 05:34:31,520
I tried to tell you, but you look at me like maybe.

5083
05:34:31,880 --> 05:34:33,520
You and 17%.

5084
05:34:33,520 --> 05:34:38,240
Oh, that doesn't sound great.

5085
05:34:40,100 --> 05:34:43,020
I just want to be robbing.

5086
05:34:45,020 --> 05:34:45,700
Oh,

5087
05:34:49,460 --> 05:34:50,460
Chase, do we feel sharp?

5088
05:34:52,200 --> 05:34:57,540
Okay, but like, do you want to watch the same playthrough of someone not being robbing?

5089
05:34:58,020 --> 05:35:01,360
Or do you want to watch the 17%?

5090
05:35:01,960 --> 05:35:07,420
Send the ground team, save the Terrence, held your own against...

5091
05:35:07,420 --> 05:35:07,680
Yay!

5092
05:35:09,580 --> 05:35:39,780

05:35:44,820 --> 05:35:46,220

Well, not... Well, I have a third monitor, but I'm going to go install my third monitor after this stream.

5118
05:36:59,700 --> 05:37:00,460

Thank you.

5131
05:37:11,980 --> 05:37:13,540
Doki, you're an itch and your name is Robert.

5132
05:37:13,760 --> 05:37:15,300
You gotta live with this.

5133

Thank you, thank you.

5137
05:37:19,940 --> 05:37:23,620
I knew you wouldn't make the correct choices to piss off everyone in chat.

5138
05:37:23,980 --> 05:37:27,080
You are the best Doki to ever punish.

5139
05:37:27,360 --> 05:37:28,640
Thank you for the super chat.

5140
05:37:28,740 --> 05:37:29,320
Thank you, thank you.

5141
05:37:29,360 --> 05:37:31,280
What do you mean the wrong choices?

5142
05:37:31,500 --> 05:37:34,240
These were the choices that vibe with me the most.

5143
05:37:34,760 --> 05:37:37,920
I thought they were great choices, guys.

5144
05:37:40,160 --> 05:38:46,840

5145
05:38:47,980 --> 05:38:51,200
Why does he have to be 100% straight?

5146
05:38:51,500 --> 05:38:53,600
He could be a little bit curious.

5147
05:38:54,020 --> 05:38:55,240
That's all I'm saying.

5148
05:38:58,100 --> 05:39:02,560
Like, being surrounded with all these superheroes and super villains?

5149
05:39:03,100 --> 05:39:06,760
I mean, so true.

5150
05:39:07,080 --> 05:39:08,280
You could be a little curious.

5151
05:39:09,580 --> 05:39:11,620
I mean, what's that game called?

5152
05:39:11,800 --> 05:39:13,440
The Dungeons and Dragons game.

5153
05:39:13,780 --> 05:39:15,720
That was that one game of the year.

5154
05:39:16,260 --> 05:39:19,460
Everyone loved that game because you could romance everyone.

5155
05:39:19,800 --> 05:39:20,940
That's why it was so popular.

5156
05:39:21,520 --> 05:39:30,000
I swear to God, if that game doesn't restricted the romancing, the game would not have one game of the year, chat.

5157
05:39:31,280 --> 05:39:31,800
Baldur's Gate.

5158
05:39:32,100 --> 05:39:39,200
If Baldur's Gate 3 restricted who you could romance, it would not have one game of the year.

5159
05:39:42,120 --> 05:39:46,580
I should be allowed to romance everyone.

5160
05:39:47,820 --> 05:39:48,900
Hey, guys.

5161
05:39:49,340 --> 05:39:50,800
I'll see you guys later, everybody.

5162
05:39:51,240 --> 05:39:52,100
Bye, guys.

5163
05:39:52,460 --> 05:39:52,900
Bye.
