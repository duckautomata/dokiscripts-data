1
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,530
Do I sound okay?

2
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,150
Do I look okay?

3
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:52,570
Like I'm such a mess right now.

4
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:53,590
Hello, hello.

5
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:55,590
Any echo?

6
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:57,270
Is it echoey?

7
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:57,930
Is it better?

8
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,670
Oh, I sound.

9
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:03,970
Okay, no echo.

10
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,010
Oh, thank God.

11
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:05,770
Okay, okay.

12
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:06,990
I sound the same.

13
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:07,430
Okay.

14
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,490
So I got, oh my God, I got soundproofing done.

15
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:15,450
So, um, that's why I had to, um, I had to push back a little
bit.

16
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:23,910
little bit so well it was not more than a little bit but I
got soundproofing done um in my office so um that's why I

17
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:30,630
had to push it back because it did take a while so that
means if I get a noise like we had we had this thing where

18
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:37,090
it's like this little rectangular thing and there's like a
little fluffy mic thing where it checks like the decibel of

19
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:44,770
um of like oh it's a little bit of echo don't worry I'll
just throw some I'll just grab a buy a carpet or something

20
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:54,530
by a rug or something um so so you know like those like
things that uh you can check how loud you are the decibel

21
00:02:54,530 --> 00:03:03,450
thing so if i get a noise complaint no no i don't know
they're like right up to my door or so they're either the it

22
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:12,330
might have been like a goddamn plot twist and like um and my
the people that were actually complaining was like my my

23
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:19,910
like downstairs neighbor or some shit like i don't at that
point because I can't obviously I can't soundproof the floor

24
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:30,050
so like if I get a noise complaint uh from somebody it had
it's like a plot shows it's actually my downstairs neighbor

25
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:38,750
um it was never it wasn't even my next door neighbor it was
actually my downstairs neighbor like so so if that's the

26
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:50,990
case then I'm fucked uh so yes I finally got soundproof done
um So that means I will be able to, I will be able to do my

27
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:51,550
5 a.m.

28
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:52,590
streams, I hope.

29
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:54,070
I hope.

30
00:03:55,230 --> 00:04:01,310
But also, I was struggling a bit because I actually broke my
monitor.

31
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,330
I broke one of my monitors.

32
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:06,790
So I'm working with two monitors for today.

33
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,470
But don't worry, I do have another monitor.

34
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:15,450
I do have an Xpair third monitor for just in case the
monitor.

35
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:24,190
breaks um it was like it was very unfortunate um i think i
asked i was i had to like um sorry i'm like my my mind is so

36
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:31,290
frazzled right now so i can't do words right now i can't
like fucking i also hit okay guys don't be too don't be like

37
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:39,910
are you okay like do you think i was like don't you please
also might have hit my head a little bit um the top of my

38
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:45,790
head a little bit because i hit I bumped my head into
something but I'm okay I think I'm okay

39
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:55,550
I'm okay because I was like try okay so what happened was I
was trying to take my monitor I was trying to well not my

40
00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:02,870
monitor I was trying to like connect something to the back
of my desk and then I hit my um I hit the uh the corner the

41
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:09,350
monitor like hit my the top of my head because I was trying
to unplug something um that's not why it broke though that's

42
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:22,390
not I don't know maybe that's why i broke because my head
was just so fucking solid um um anyway so uh so my monitor

43
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:29,310
can't turn on anymore it turns on but you know like the fail
safe where it would like automatically turn off right away

44
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:37,790
so so uh so whenever i try to turn the monitor on it just
goes and then it just turns off right away like i don't

45
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:45,030
fucking know what to do so we're running on two monitors
right now until like i get my third monitor plugged back in

46
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:54,230
uh so yep that's really it it's not i don't know i tried i
was like maybe it's the plugs maybe it's like the cable i

47
00:05:54,230 --> 00:06:01,170
tried like three different cables it's none of it worked so
um i think it i don't know maybe it's something inside

48
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:09,410
fucked up because it just instantly turns off on itself so i
do have another I have another monitor right now as my main

49
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:18,430
monitor so um it's very weird because it's a it's different
from my usual monitor uh because at first it was like oh do

50
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:25,370
you want to run it the recommended resolution which was like
3000 or some shit and I was like sure and I clicked on the

51
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:36,390
3000 and um and then like everything enlarged you guys were
like what the fuck do you mean dokey okay so and all my

52
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:45,390
stuff on my OBS so I'll show you guys what I mean so um
obviously the oh wait what okay there you go obviously this

53
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:57,510
is the recommended resolution that they wanted me to put in
and then where did I go where did I go on the OBS but then

54
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:01,630
if I put on the one below that um I get

55
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:12,510
So, I don't want to, I don't know, I can't be bothered
resizing all, because I actually have to resize everything

56
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:17,270
if I want to, if I want to do the recommended resolution.

57
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,610
And I can't be bothered.

58
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,910
I'm so used to what everything looks like.

59
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:29,950
So, you know, like, I don't know, it fucks with me if like
one thing changes, like that size wise, or like if I'm like

60
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,410
a little bit to the left, it like fucks with me a lot.

61
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:46,110
where I was for so long that like I just don't like change I
just don't like change change is bad Anthony thank you for

00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:06,770

things I'm all over the place right now I had to wake up so

65
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:14,030
early too for the soundproofing and stuff so I got the
consultation for sound like the quotes and consultation the

66
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:18,930
day before and I also had to wake up super early for that
and they're like we can do it get it done tomorrow I was

67
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:24,910
like sweet and then and then obviously I have to wake up
super early again to have them do the soundproofing and

68
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:31,490
everything so I'm all over the place right now I'm not I'm
not mentally there and I also hit my head too like I'm okay

69
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:46,170
I'm okay um I'm okay guys, don't worry But yeah, so So I'm
just like all over the place By the way, some people were

70
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:58,050
like Is she gonna play the censored or the non-censored
Version of this patch So the thing is No, there's no bump I

71
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:04,410
like touched the top of my head And there's no like, it's
not like you know there's no bump on my head so i think i'm

72
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:15,590
okay um but anyway so apparently there is a censored and a
non-censored version and then um i asked one of my friends

73
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:25,190
who's like fucking obsessed with dispatch right now because
i was like okay how bad is non-censored and then they were

74
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:35,610
like oh yeah at the beginning like i was like okay do i see
an actual penis because i That's fine, but I need a no, do I

75
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:36,010
see?

76
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,610
Is it just there?

77
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:41,750
Is it just there?

78
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,890
Because that's when YouTube's like, no, no, no.

79
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:51,490
Because boobs, for some reason, boobs, because I don't know
if you guys know this on YouTube, but it allows you to see

80
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:58,050
certain nudity because they'll just be like, it's
educational or it's just part of the game.

81
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:02,010
But the moment there's a dick, that's when YouTube's like,
no.

82
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:05,370
Peepies are not allowed.

83
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:11,590
So, so I'm like, okay, how bad is it?

84
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:16,010
So, because apparently dicks aren't educational.

85
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:28,290
So, so my friend was like, showed me a clip of the first, I
guess, like 20 seconds, like the intro, where you see the

86
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:29,810
back of the peepie.

87
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,690
And I was like, that's not bad.

88
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:39,110
wet like it's these and then my friend was like oh yeah no
that's not the worst part no it shows the full-on pee-pee

89
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:49,930
later on i'm like oh okay that's bad that's bad guys we the
thing is i can't have another video get striped r18 guys you

90
00:10:49,930 --> 00:11:01,370
know what happens um uh but no the thing is the thing is i'm
pretty sure i don't know jacksepticeye's rod might be r18

91
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:07,830
because you know what striped as R18, my Garfield, sorry,
Docafield, Jim, don't come after me.

92
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:09,010
It's a parody.

93
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:14,450
My Docafield Halloween stream got marked as R18.

94
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:17,110
So I can't do it again.

95
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:24,910
Because if you have too many streams marked as R18, YouTube
actually fucks with your algorithm.

96
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:30,210
So we can't do that again.

97
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:39,110
I don't want down on me um so i'm pretty sure like i think
get away with this on twitch but like on youtube like i

98
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:49,250
don't think i can get away with it uh but uh but i think i
don't know if jack's vibe yeah jack i'm tight with him like

99
00:11:49,250 --> 00:12:02,510
that i caught him by his first name uh i don't know if jack
septica's uh stream of uh of dispatch um was marked as r.n

100
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:03,030
18.

101
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,010
I'm not sure.

102
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:05,470
Can anyone vouch?

103
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,010
Sorry, my bro Sean.

104
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:08,670
Oh yeah.

105
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,290
God, I'm sorry.

106
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:11,430
Sean, I forgot.

107
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,250
His name isn't Jack.

108
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:17,670
He likes it when we call him Jack.

109
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:24,670
So is his stream or video?

110
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,750
I don't know if he does the let's play.

111
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:30,510
Marked R 18 because I'm not bad dealing with that.

112
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:41,790
I'm not dealing with r18 guys it is but i also think i also
think he got away with he gets away with it because you know

113
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:53,290
um i also oh okay it's a video okay i also think he gets
away with it because he's literally like og youtube and he's

114
00:12:53,290 --> 00:13:03,530
part of the game and i think if i try to stream non-censored
um i don't know how You take me.

115
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:10,270
He is a bigger streamer.

116
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:12,750
I don't think I matter to YouTube.

117
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,390
There's birds and bees.

118
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:16,150
Thank you.

119
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:16,770
Thank you, Super Chat.

120
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:17,510
Thank you, thank you.

121
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:21,690
Other than that, I have no idea what Dispatch really is.

122
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:24,090
I've heard people saying that it's sort of like Telltale.

123
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:28,750
It's like a Telltale game, so it's just watching cutscenes
and walking around, which is great.

124
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,010
I don't have to do much.

125
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:41,770
with extra steps so that's cool that's fine i think i don't
know if i'm gonna do all the way till the end um uh so yeah

126
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:49,650
and apparently it's made by telltale devs too so the only
also the other thing that i know about this batch is um you

127
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:57,890
mean temporary planet but you plan forever i've been saying
that like like at least once a day that's like that's my new

00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:35,310
that is all the things I know about this patch, so, uh,
sorry, I apologize for starting late today, um, but, you

149
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:40,810
know, I finally got soundproofing, I went through a lot of
technical difficulties, but, you know, I finally got

150
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:50,170
soundproofing, though, so, like, you know, good for future
streams, at least, yeah, um, um, so, yeah, we're just gonna,

151
00:15:50,170 --> 00:16:00,830
we're gonna try it out today, I don't know if I'm gonna do,
um, do all the episodes, I looked up that, you know, it's

152
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:09,870
like eight hours long and I don't know if I'm ready for an
eight hour playthrough For today, so we'll see if we get to

153
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:21,690
episode four and then I'm like, you know what I'm ready Then
then we'll maybe we'll do eight hours So we'll see if I

154
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:31,930
we'll see we'll see anyway Also another reason why I want to
play this game is for man bat for furry of the he is the he

155
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:41,010
is the wild the wild dark horse for the furry of the year
contender uh for those who don't know the context so every

156
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:51,750
year there so for those who need context don't worry i
explained this before on the batman stream which was very

157
00:16:51,750 --> 00:17:10,410
appropriate uh let me pull up the year they would every year
um they would select one furry for the hot furry of the year

158
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:24,230
uh and right now it is between man bat and and i don't
remember it's another wolf it's it's it's another wolf i

159
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:35,190
don't fucking know so apparently man bat Charlie, Boys
Critical, is like the one to end the cycle, the wolf cycle.

160
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:41,610
And everyone's trying to figure out who is going to be 2025
Fury of the Year.

161
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:47,310
Will it be another dog?

162
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:50,530
Or will it be a bat?

163
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:52,970
The Raid of Wolf.

164
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:56,890
Will the Raid of Wolfmen end this year?

165
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:10,850
you with the super chat thank you thank you so we're gonna
find out if the cycle will end so i vote for charlie's

166
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:20,370
persona so that's the other thing i know about um about this
fact the craziest thing is that i knew about man bad because

167
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:31,290
i saw this pn because i saw that viral tweet on twitter
being like please end the wolf cycle We must vote for ManBat

168
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:34,330
to be this year's furry of the year.

169
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,950
And that's how I knew about ManBat.

170
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:39,950
And I was like, wait, that guy's from this batch out.

171
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:46,930
That's the only reason why I knew about ManBat.

172
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,310
It's like, break the cycle.

173
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,710
Damn, the sonar situation is crazy, guys.

174
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,530
I also love all the videos.

175
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:59,210
I love Spineapples.

176
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:05,410
If you guys know who Spineapple is, she's like a really
famous animator for TF2 before.

177
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:09,830
Like she would make like lots of amazing, dumb, funny Team
Fortress 2 animations.

178
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:19,510
And then she did like one for where she like basically took
like moist critical clips and then like animated to like the

179
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,590
Mechamac situation.

180
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:21,630
It's crazy.

181
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:22,990
It's so good.

182
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,830
I'll link it to you guys who doesn't want to see it.

183
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,690

187
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:58,170

game especially because it would change based on her

188
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:58,650
decisions.

189
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,270

Yeah, yippee.

197
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:16,550
All right, guys, let's play some Dispatch.

198
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:19,370
Oh, God, it's so weird having two monitors right now.

199
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:21,650
All right, I got to move this to my...

200
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,010
Oh, my God.

201
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:24,750
Okay, this is so weird.

202
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,110
I got to figure out how to...

203
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:28,170
I have to move all of this.

204
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:29,590
All right.

205
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:35,070
Thing is, I'll be changing this monitor, the main monitor,
to a different monitor again, too.

206
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:37,770
So it's going to be all over the place.

207
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:38,290
All right.

208
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:41,490
Don't block my dispatch.

209
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:43,210
All right.

210
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:44,170
Dispatch.

211
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:44,550
All right.

212
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:44,910
All right.

213
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,250
This is my, uh, Doki is my blonde blazer.

214
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:48,330
Who's blonde blazer?

215
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:51,770
I'm definitely going to make the worst choices ever, and
you're all going to yell at me.

216
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:52,730
I can feel it.

217
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:56,350
Because, like, whenever I make choices, I'm going to.

218
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:58,990
I'm like, what's the funniest choice?

219
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:03,550
Not the, what's the funniest choice out there?

220
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:11,070
Not the one that makes the most sense or like trying to be
about empathy or some shit.

221
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,570
Who the fuck cares about that?

222
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:16,430
I have to be a good person in real life, okay?

223
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:21,570
Like, why would I be a good person in a video game?

224
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:23,270
That's what real life is for.

225
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:32,630
It's video games for me to do the things I'm not supposed to
do in real life This is gonna be good Sombard, thank you for

Oh, shit.

00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:08,630
Hey, I ruined a perfectly good mattress to make sure you
didn't die.

281
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:09,970
Okay, you're welcome.

282
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:19,310
Okay, to be fair, he already gave me the information so that
I don't need to keep him alive.

283
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,550
Well, maybe a superhero is killed.

284
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:23,710
We won't get a lot of villains.

285
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:28,310
Like, that's all I'm saying.

286
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:35,810
Maybe we'll have less villains if we started killing
villains.

287
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:44,590
How is he going to remember that?

288
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,410
I technically saved his life.

289
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:48,890
I put him in a mattress.

290
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,230
Bring the music down.

291
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:58,690
Okay.

292
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:01,590
I'll bring the music down.

293
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:03,750
Cinematic music.

294
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:04,790
I'll put it at 90.

295
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:10,510
I might...

296
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:12,650
Do I even have superpowers or I'm just like...

297
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:14,970
Do I just built this mecha suit for myself?

298
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,380
No need for Arkham.

299
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:29,100
You got super jokie bird getting rid of all the super
villains.

300

305
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,740
What happens if I don't do my quick time event?

306
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,860
Okay, I...

307
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,410
Jesus Christ, we're doom scrolling right now.

308
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,160
Like...

309
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,270
I'm like, is this necessary?

310
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,500
Like, Atoki, please.

311
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,960
Am I just Iron Man?

312
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,600
All I'm saying is that...

313
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,580
My game crashed.

314
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:09,820
Okay, well, I found out apparently if you don't do your
quick time event, you're...

315
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:24,840
dispatch crashes okay okay all right i guess we go back in i
who would have thought it couldn't do that's your answer

316
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:31,900
thank you for the super chat thank you thank you my best
friend was boomed by a crazy avian bounty hunter in front of

317
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:39,920
me to do super villain numbers the first thing i'm doing is
making that my super villain origin no i have to oh my god

318
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:40,400
Okay.

319
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,260
All right.

320
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,480
Here we go again.

321
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:47,920
It's just when you add obviously, it feels a little less
obvious.

322
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,300
So I'll ask again.

323
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,100
I'll ask again.

324
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:51,560
All right.

325
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:53,340
Okay.

326
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,760
So maybe it's a little more complicated.

327
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,280
I mean, I could have asked something new.

328
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,580
It's completely understandable.

329
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,320
I could skip it in the scene select.

330
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:02,880
It didn't let me.

331
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:03,980
Look, he's gone.

332
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,800
That's a bit of an understatement.

333
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:06,080
Yeah.

334
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,040
I can't skip it.

335
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:07,300
Oh, so.

336
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,400
Well, he's more than.

337
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:17,540
again it's like i never dropped him the most gone just so
sensitive listen if i didn't love him we wouldn't be here

338
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:24,780
right we don't have to get into it oh wait he was trying to
give me a therapy session too man who killed him if i didn't

339
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:33,300
love him why would i be doing any of this oh my nose is
bleeding thought i was getting yeah twice to know that i

340
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,120

341
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:46,640
here's what's gonna happen i'm gonna hang you off the side
of this building and you're gonna tell me yeah just to show

342
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:54,160

were having a breakthrough hey we did you know we're being a

343
00:30:54,160 --> 00:31:01,780
real piece of you're pretty easy to talk to but the only oh
yeah i found out on twitter apparently um none of all the

344
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:10,140
videos are pre-rendered um they're all pre-rendered so none
of the models are in any of the files and all the gooners

345
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,840
were like so depressed

346
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:26,560
they couldn't get the models so all the gooners were still
sad they're like what's the point use your inside voice and

347
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:32,660
just tell me we're that's messed up all i'm saying is
gooners make

348
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,580
Llewellyn's deal works, okay?

349
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:38,500
Fuck.

350
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,680
You sure about that?

351
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:40,420
Yes, please.

352
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,300
That's all I know.

353
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,420
Stop screaming.

354
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,380
God damn it.

355
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,180
Help, help.

356
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,600
Hey, hey, hey.

357
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,900
I will pull you up.

358
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,900
Sam, thank you for the super chat.

359
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:49,180
Thank you.

360
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:49,780
Thank you.

361
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,240
Paying on the super chat.

362
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:51,500
Thank you.

363
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:51,960
Thank you.

364
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:57,140
Game was like, okay, if you don't want to play the game,
then there won't be a game for you to play.

365
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,440
I doomed scroll too far.

366
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,480
No, no, no, no, no.

367
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:08,170
Of course.

368
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:10,350
Of course I'll still drop him.

369
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:14,090
I ruined a perfectly good mattress to make sure you didn't
die.

370
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:14,490
Okay.

371
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:22,770
That's crazy that I didn't realize that the main character
is voiced by Jesse.

372
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,030
Sorry, what's his real name?

373
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:25,790
I don't even remember.

374
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,020
Because it sort of sounds like him, but also does not sound
like him.

375
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,420
Yeah, Aaron Paul.

376
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:39,040
Yeah.

377
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,820
Oh yeah, I was gonna up the volume a little bit more.

378
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,160
Alright, let me know if that's better.

379
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,960
Jesse, we need a dispatch.

380
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:55,800
Yeah, it's pretty good.

381
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,480
I didn't like him in Invincible.

382
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:02,220
I think his voice acting in Invincible was, like, pretty
dull.

383
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,260
Fun.

384
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,240
Yeah, he was the Pyreplex.

385
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,440
I wasn't, like, a fan of his voice acting in Pyreplex.

386
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,560
all

387
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:31,910
right sorry no more doom scrolling he was really good in
bojack yeah apparently i can't doom scroll anymore

388
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:49,030
oh shit what happens if i don't still did it still got it
thanks game i think they just didn't animate a different

389
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:52,670
scene for it I mean, it still worked.

390
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:58,570
What happens to that, I guess?

391
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:04,390
Will I get shot?

392
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:08,110
Oh, shit!

393
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:08,710
Oh, fuck!

394
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:09,590
I should have hit back!

395
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:13,070
I should have defended myself!

396
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:15,870
I thought he would defend himself for me.

397
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,360
So, fight back!

398
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,580
I thought the game would help me.

399
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:32,340
I guess it's time to make new models on Blender.

400
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:34,920
No, thank you for the super chat.

401
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:35,220
Thank you.

402
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:35,800
Thank you.

403
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,500
My actions have consequences?

404
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:38,600
No way.

405
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,460
Oh, WSD.

406
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,120
Am I supposed to go?

407
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,020
Time to finish this.

408
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:47,080

Sorry, I was looking down.

420
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,040
I was looking down.

421
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,060
Hacking is so easy, guys.

422
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,160
It's so easy.

423
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:36,080
Can I die in this game?

424
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:39,500
Like, if I fail too many quick time events?

425
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,440
It's over, shroud.

426
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:47,180
Can I get a copy of that video when we're through here?

427
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,800
Because it's over, Shroud.

428
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,080
That's right.

429
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,200
It would be nice to watch that back at a different angle.

430
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:54,340
That's right, Shroud.

431
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,720
I'm aiming for you.

432
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,380
I'll be the next FPS streamer.

433
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,600
Where the fuck is Shroud?

434
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,500
Where the fuck is Shroud?

435
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,420
Yeah, where is Shroud?

436
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,060
Is he still streaming Arc Raiders?

437
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,740
After a conversation, I asked him about your dad.

438
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,180
Fun little tidbit.

439
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,480
He was very well hydrated.

440
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:22,080
right after shroud shot him in the chest your dad pissed his
pants bet you didn't know that huh so after that yes are you

441
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:29,560
too busy playing our creators right now still at enough time
to know how absolutely he was and just pissed himself like a

442
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:43,040
little it was like so much hunter stomping dad was wearing
shorts so just kept i get it oh oh like foot oh i should

443
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,960
have stomped him

444
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,470
If I knew...

445
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,440
Oh, this is the Mecha Man situation.

446
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,280
Wait, I'm Mecha Man.

447
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,700
I understand now.

448
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,040
Sorry, I didn't think I didn't need to waste a perfectly
good mattress to break your fall.

449
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,160
Perfectly good.

450
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,920
Oh, shit.

451
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,520
Was already in the dumpster.

452
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,740
Can we just skip to the part where you...

453
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:10,520
How is he alive?

454
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,460
Oh, God!

455
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,820
Oh, there's the PPC.

456
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:18,880
Oh,

457
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:22,800
there you go.

458
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:23,600
Okay, there.

459
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,180
There it is.

460
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,280
Clever super villain there.

461
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,500
You can call me toxic.

462
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:30,160
Okay.

463
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:31,960
There it is.

464
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:32,960
So many levels for you.

465
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,000
Yeah, no shit.

466
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,260
That's the point.

467
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:39,380
That is.

468
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:43,220
Trout's augments are pretty good when Normie's.

469
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:43,580
Oh, yeah, no.

470
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:44,380
Yeah, no.

471
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,300
No, we will not be safe on YouTube.

472
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:46,920
Yeah, no.

473
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:48,320
If I...

474
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,260
Yeah, no.

475
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:50,720
We would have not been saved.

476
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,600
It's just...

477
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:00,100
Oh, shit.

478
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,640
Okay, wait, I got help.

479
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,480
I got to help him out, bro.

480
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,760
Thank God we're just sick.

481
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,460
That's right.

482
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,880
Why don't I just rip it off?

483
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:15,480
I mean, it's just swinging there.

484
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,820
It's just... Yeah, why don't I...

485
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:18,320
Why don't I just...

486
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,780
Just rip it up.

487
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:20,580
Fuck.

488
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:26,120
Don't let it hit you.

489
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,520
Oh my god, you're right, I could- Oh shit!

490
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,780
You're right, I could have just like swung it around too.

491
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:40,140
That's against the man goat.

492
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,880
Just start using it as a rope.

493
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:44,620
Figures.

494
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,920
All right.

495
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,460
Piece of shit.

496
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:06,020
Oh, man.

497
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,740
This fight scene is pretty good, though.

498
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,460
Wait, it's just Jello.

499
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:14,180
Do all of them just let it swing around like that?

500
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:15,920
Like...

501
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,040
Oh, this way.

502
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:28,340
Black sensor clock.

503
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:29,260
Oh, shit!

504
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:34,360
Alright.

505
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:35,920
Bye-bye.

506
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:39,260
Yay!

507
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,720
One less super villain.

508
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:48,690
Oh, shit.

509
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:49,750
Where's his dick?

510
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:52,470
See, he lives, guys.

511
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:59,290
Bro, why is it, like, just in my

512
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:07,770
Oh no, wait, it's burning my mecha suit.

513
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:12,210
Oh shit.

514
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,300
Wait, what am I doing?

515
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,140
I'm rebooting?

516
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,780
I'm alt F4ing?

517
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:28,880
Alt F4 and reboot.

518
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,060
Oh, this is looking bad.

519
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:36,700
Jakarta, thank you for the super chat.

520
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,520
Thank you, thank you.

521
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,260
Oh, I'm a barrier?

522
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,660
Wait, would I have died if I didn't do that?

523
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:52,700
I'm overclocking.

524
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:53,740
Don't worry.

525
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:57,680
Shroud!

526
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,820
He came back from Arc Raiders!

527
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:05,660
Hey, Shroud!

528
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,560
Welcome back!

529
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:13,480
So, what do you got left on them shields?

530
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:26,520
I said 40% He stopped his stream You're down to 28 And he is
not wrong about these things Good news, buddy Shroud says he

531
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:35,600
just wants the Astral Pulse Which we all know Isn't really
yours anyway Unless he missed the opportunity To not get

532
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:45,340
Shrouded Oh, there he is Your dad killer Okay System check.

533
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:47,840
Calculate the damage per second hitting shields.

534
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:52,060
Then tell me how many seconds I need to divert Astral Pulse
energy to Raka boosters.

535
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,400
Animation's really good.

536
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:55,320
Also, sound guy.

537
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,120
I hope all the sound is good so far.

538
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,700
Pulse power to the boosters.

539
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:03,120
It won't work.

540
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:06,160
This is a limited time offer, dude.

541
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,000
What's up?

542
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,060
Ignore him.

543
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,440
Villains always lie.

544
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:10,800
Oh, shit.

545
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:11,260
No.

546
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:12,560
I don't give a fuck, okay?

547
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:14,160
here.

548
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:18,340
He says you're not calculating that ship stuck to your leg,
dumbass.

549
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:20,300
Nuh-uh.

550
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,380
Fuck it.

551
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,320
I wanted to hear more of the dialogue.

552
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:31,420
All going to plan.

553
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:32,660
Now get out of there, baby.

554
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:33,920
See, everything's fine.

555
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:36,840
Come on.

556
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,960
See, I told you he was lying.

557
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:48,940
Okay, But why censor the ass?

558
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:50,240
This ass is fine.

559
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,780
Ass is technically PG.

560
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:56,720
Yeah!

561
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:00,680
Pulse status.

562
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:01,700
Stable.

563
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,360
Foreign device detected.

564
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:05,620
Oh?

565
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:06,860
Oh, do I have a tracker?

566
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:09,140
Or like...

567
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:09,640
Oh.

568
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,680
He don't get to have cake and eat it too.

569
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,420
Stop fear!

570
00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:30,470
That's fine.

571
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:31,730
He's a mean character.

572
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:36,440
Dispatch.

573
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:41,320
But that Mega Man situation was crazy though.

574
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,760
Oh hey, are we watching TikTok now?

575
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:51,460
It was just over four months ago that images like this were
recorded across the Southland.

576
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:56,180
Videos flooded social media and our newsroom showing what
many thought to be.

577
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:07,760
the death of mecha man again again for near oh like us his
dad man has protected los angeles built by an ordinary

578
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:15,600
civilian with no superpowers this first suit was dubbed by
some fans as mecha man prime that's his dad three

579
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:22,860
generations of pilot oh that's his grandpa secret have given
everything to protect this community including their lives

580
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:31,680
after the tragic passing of prime the next mecha man astral
teamed up with a star-studded superhero group known as the

581
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:41,600
brave brigade leading to its legacy legacy position after
years of loyal service tragedy loyal nepotism when shroud a

582
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:50,160
former brave brigade member turned villain killed the pilot
of mecha man in cold blood but yet again as hope was lost a

583
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:57,520
third generation of mecha man emerged a mecha man for the
modern era a bulwark against organized crime in in the

584
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,960
greater Los Angeles area until...

585
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:04,420
Earlier today, Mecca had broke his silence.

586
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,080
And addressed the bloodline.

587
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:14,620
Wait, he's fine.

588
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:16,660
He didn't die.

589
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:17,700
He's literally right here.

590
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,740
Just build another suit.

591
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,200
I had speculation to rest.

592
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:29,760
The suit has been damaged beyond my ability to repair, so I
will be stepping back from superhero...

593
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:30,760
But just build another suit!

594
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:31,420
What do you mean?

595
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,740
Does this mean you're finished?

596
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:34,860
Can you repair your suit?

597
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:35,620
What's next for Mecca Man?

598
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:35,900
Yeah!

599
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,120
That means your career is over.

600
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:38,440
How badly were you hurt?

601
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:39,640
One at a time, please.

602
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:42,280
Ashley Rynes, San Pedro Daly?

603
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:44,840
Do you have anything to say to your fans?

604
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:49,780
The public outpouring, the vigils, a lot of them were
worried you wouldn't wake up.

605
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,220
I suppose I want them to know I did my best.

606
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:56,860
I worked as long as I could, as hard as I could.

607
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:58,480
Oh, he's so fucking depressed.

608
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,360
That's all anyone can do.

609
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:00,420
Next question.

610
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,040
Chris Stratton.

611
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,100
Torrent's Tribune.

612
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:05,800
Does this mean you're retiring as Mecha Man?

613
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:08,340
Word on the street is, you're Dunzo.

614
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,400
Are you a hundred years old?

615
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:11,500
Why are you talking like that?

616
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,100
Answer the question, buddy boy.

617
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:14,380
Are you retiring?

618
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,680
My readers need the skinny, and I aim to deliver.

619
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:19,180
No comment.

620
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:21,720
I'm not looking to comment on that just yet.

621
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:24,480
That's the only skinny I can give you.

622
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:27,360
You deserve my comment after that.

623
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,720
You saw me, no comment.

624
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:30,460
Just one more.

625
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,280
Heads on for you.

626
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:35,700
Charles Kingsley, South Bay Signal.

627
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:44,760
So, Shroud kills your father, goes to jail 50 years, breaks
out, and immediately dupes you into a trap where he destroys

628
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:47,400
the Mecha Man suit and puts you in a coma for months.

629
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,380
I can't get over the fact that his name is Shroud.

630
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:50,480
I was like, Shroud, didn't I?

631
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,520
Holy fuck, Shroud.

632
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:54,520
Shroud did what?

633
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:55,800
Why didn't Shroud kill you?

634
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,180
You haven't been conscious for months.

635
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:00,340
It'd be easy money taking you out.

636
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:04,740
Bro, I'm sure I got real toxic.

637
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:05,700
He got both.

638
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:07,720
I'm not sure I mattered much.

639
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:09,820
You're unimportant.

640
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,140
Which leads me to my next question.

641
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:14,760
Most heroes avenge their family.

642
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:16,960
You did the opposite.

643
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:18,000
What did I do?

644
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,180
You killed their legacy.

645
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:20,020
What?

646
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,420
How disappointed would your dad be if he were here right
now?

647
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:24,960
I'm still alive.

648
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:26,160
I could come back.

649
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:27,760
I'll attack.

650
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:29,000
Fuck you.

651
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:31,960
You know what?

652
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:33,280
Who cares?

653
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:34,920
I'm retired anyway.

654
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:40,920
My reputation is...

655
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:41,540
Oh, yeah!

656
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:42,640
Yeah!

657
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,640
On international news, dude?

658
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:48,580
Of course.

659
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,020
But there's two issues there.

660
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:51,880
He clearly has nothing left.

661
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:52,980
Exactly.

662
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,780
I have nothing left to lose.

663
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,900
I'm technically retired.

664
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:00,860
Yay, alcoholism, too.

665
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,020
No one was stepping in.

666
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:05,800
Bro, I wouldn't fucking have.

667
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:13,320

I did it, guys.

692
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:41,280
That guy I threw.

693
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,160
He landed on the roof, right?

694
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:43,920
Yeah, totally.

695
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:48,180
Hi, I'm Blomblazer.

696
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:50,900
I work over at Superhero Dispatch Network.

697
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:52,360
Also, I can't believe it!

698
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:54,400
You can't romance the man back!

699
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:55,160
You know who you are.

700
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,900
He's 100% straight!

701
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,400
That's also the only deal breaker for me.

702
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,040
I'm just a corporate hero for hire.

703
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:04,600
You're the real deal.

704
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,960
I found that out as well.

705
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:09,840
I'm so sad.

706
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,920
I don't think infamous is the same as famous, but...

707
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:14,240
Oh, God.

708
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:15,040
Your arm.

709
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:15,840
Oh, fuck.

710
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:19,080
Oh, yeah.

711
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:20,320
Oh, yeah, that's gross.

712
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:20,700
Yeah.

713
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,900
Divide 0% upshade.

714
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:25,540
That's your S2 thing in the Super Chat thing.

715
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:26,240
Thank you.

716
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:29,280
Usually dislocates the other way.

717
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:30,220
Have you done this before?

718
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:43,100
but have you done this before because maybe oh god okay wow
that's uh that's okay thank you one of them is on that roof

719
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:57,830
yeah mecha man mecha man you look like you can only romance
two people and they're both women what makes you say that i

720
00:51:57,830 --> 00:52:00,970
could just romance all of them you know i have nothing to
lose.

721
00:52:01,310 --> 00:52:03,630
I should be able to romance any character.

722
00:52:04,270 --> 00:52:05,590
I didn't even realize it.

723
00:52:05,850 --> 00:52:10,830
I should be able to hook up with everyone.

724
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:16,290
So true.

725
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:18,450
Where's my hair around?

726
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:22,070
I'm thinking about the back of the ship.

727
00:52:22,190 --> 00:52:23,390
I don't really make jokes like that.

728
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:25,910
I think Vizzy's rubbing off on me.

729
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:26,230
Who?

730
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:28,530
Someone I work with.

731
00:52:29,570 --> 00:52:30,010
It's...

732
00:52:30,010 --> 00:52:30,150
Yeah.

733
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:36,850
what this feels like a challenge

734
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:50,090
that feels like a challenge yeah no do it chug chug chug
love is in the air don't worry about keeping up something to

735
00:52:50,090 --> 00:52:59,890
do with the powers it actually be like a romance shroud my
daddy killer very sad sentence hey you should give yourself

736
00:52:59,890 --> 00:53:07,610
more credit to do what you did for as long as you did
especially without superpowers not true what do you call

737
00:53:07,610 --> 00:53:17,450
this oh god i can fix that one for you too no thanks i like
this one thank you yeah and to toxic yeah enemies to lovers

738
00:53:17,450 --> 00:53:25,550
exactly so this game would have been perfect if i could
romance everyone hundreds of thousands of millions so you'll

739
00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:33,570
understand when the check comes you're serious millions yeah
i basically burned through my entire inheritance keeping it

740
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:43,770
going last couple years have just been duct tape and sheer
determination what like what is this job what did he said to

741
00:53:43,770 --> 00:53:50,150
sacrifice everything to be a superhero to the point of
financial oh my god it's like batman if he's broke hardship

742
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:58,650
but ruin was the first man if he had no money you must be
completely it's like i've missed the only thing i'm good at

743
00:53:58,650 --> 00:54:11,330
this is what i'm good at now that's a sad sentence come on
that can't be true i guess it could be true so are you he's

744
00:54:11,330 --> 00:54:20,490
broke man uh yeah yeah i should probably switch into water
good because i was hoping after some drinks to loosen you up

745
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:29,310
i could learn a little more about you And if all that went
well, this is why he didn't invest, guys.

746
00:54:29,530 --> 00:54:30,270
He fucked up.

747
00:54:30,450 --> 00:54:32,670
You always have, like, passive income.

748
00:54:32,950 --> 00:54:35,110
I'm just trying to figure out if this is a fit or not.

749
00:54:35,270 --> 00:54:38,450
You know, then it's just a matter of picking the right
moment.

750
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:39,090
A bar?

751
00:54:39,230 --> 00:54:43,730
Well, propositions late at night in a bar can go any number
of ways.

752
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:46,710
That's actually...

753
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:47,170
What's that?

754
00:54:48,270 --> 00:54:50,090
This is, like, pure alcohol.

755
00:54:50,390 --> 00:54:51,530
It's not like alcohol.

756
00:54:51,770 --> 00:54:52,090
It is.

757
00:54:52,190 --> 00:55:00,230
Alcohol I know because you spit it directly and damn that's
so hot guys that's water that see how it is guys I have such

758
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:02,930
good risk hard liquor from a pint glass actually.

759
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:07,430
I usually just drink it straight from the bottle, but I
thought she's an alcoholic

760
00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:14,690
I'm gonna go clean up she likes it guys see she likes this
fine.

761
00:55:14,810 --> 00:55:19,250
She likes it right back She likes when I'm lesser than her

762
00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:30,290
Yeah, she's into it.

763
00:55:30,450 --> 00:55:35,230
The more pathetic I am, the more I'm attracted to her.

764
00:55:35,990 --> 00:55:37,510
Don't you watch the news?

765
00:55:37,870 --> 00:55:39,270
This is a superhero bar.

766
00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:40,450
Oh, wow.

767
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:41,610

768
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:43,610
That's so cool.

769
00:55:44,110 --> 00:55:45,110

everyone know in the room that you're a douchebag because

775
00:56:08,530 --> 00:56:14,470
you should literally never do that unless you're at the
final table of the world series of poker but even then if

776
00:56:14,470 --> 00:56:17,510
you win you're still a fucking loser

777
00:56:22,190 --> 00:56:22,890
I'm gonna lose.

778
00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:25,710

And the flame.

783
00:56:34,010 --> 00:56:36,290
And my skin does not burn.

784
00:56:36,770 --> 00:56:38,530
I am flambé.

785
00:56:39,370 --> 00:56:39,990
And you...

786
00:56:39,990 --> 00:56:44,070
Wait, oh shit, I do remember you're that shitty villain I
busted up.

00:56:44,390 --> 00:56:45,570
Wait, he's a villain?

788
00:56:45,890 --> 00:56:48,590
As I literally just said.

789
00:56:49,090 --> 00:56:50,350
I am flambé.

790
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:51,990

Should be able to reattach it.

Punch up.

806
00:57:42,350 --> 00:57:43,250
Teeth don't work that way.

807
00:57:43,370 --> 00:57:45,150
You're thinking of fingers and dicks.

808
00:57:45,790 --> 00:57:46,230
You know what?

809
00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:47,210
Give it a shot.

810
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:48,510
Oh, is it funnier with alcohol?

811
00:57:48,650 --> 00:57:49,690
Do I not live?

812
00:57:49,710 --> 00:57:50,950
Get the fuck out of here.

00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:52,170
I get it.

814
00:57:52,190 --> 00:57:53,750
Can you just tell Blazer I'm outside?

815
00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:55,550
Oh.

816
00:57:56,330 --> 00:57:56,930
Out!

817
00:57:58,150 --> 00:57:58,970
Relax, I'm leaving.

818
00:58:05,490 --> 00:58:07,270
Wouldn't alcohol hurt me more?

819
00:58:10,010 --> 00:58:10,610
Like...

820
00:58:10,610 --> 00:58:12,810
Hey, I couldn't find you.

821
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:14,470
It's cool.

822
00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:16,990
I was just admiring the art on this dumpster.

823
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:22,010
Can't tell why anyone would put those words together.

824
00:58:22,510 --> 00:58:22,690
All right.

825
00:58:22,990 --> 00:58:24,310
Why are you holding drinks?

826
00:58:24,530 --> 00:58:25,050
Nightcap?

827
00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:26,030
You're not.

828
00:58:26,050 --> 00:58:27,290
God, she's an alcoholic.

829
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:30,590
Actually, according to the bartender, that's exactly what
you are.

830
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:32,010
What happened in there?

831
00:58:32,810 --> 00:58:34,750
I walk out and the bartender's pissed.

832
00:58:35,410 --> 00:58:36,670
The whole energy is awkward.

833
00:58:37,770 --> 00:58:41,150
And I almost rolled the heck out of my ankle on this
slippery floor.

834
00:58:41,370 --> 00:58:42,390
The guy fell down.

835
00:58:43,010 --> 00:58:44,090
It was pretty funny.

836
00:58:44,590 --> 00:58:45,290
Yeah, it's crazy.

837
00:58:45,570 --> 00:58:47,050

838
00:58:47,330 --> 00:58:48,350
She got me free alcohol.

839
00:58:48,370 --> 00:58:49,370
The guy fell down.

840
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:50,750
Usually you're supposed to get her alcohol.

841
00:58:51,090 --> 00:58:52,790
Does that not sound convincing?

842
00:58:52,790 --> 00:58:54,050
Are they both for herself?

843
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:54,670
Hold these.

844
00:58:55,190 --> 00:58:55,910

847
00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:23,670
Uppies, we got upies.

848
00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:24,150

00:59:25,870 --> 00:59:28,550
Yeah, she's, yeah, she's the muscle, mommy.

850
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,900
This is like LA propaganda.

851
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:55,320
To sit on it.

852
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:56,760
Oh, yeah.

853
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:57,920
That would have been cool.

854
00:59:59,540 --> 00:59:59,740
Oh, no.

855
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:00,680
Phenomenal.

856
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:02,540
Because you can see it.

857
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:05,380
And it looks like there's a couple up there already.

858
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:06,760
I really needed this.

859
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:12,200
All of this has been pretty overwhelming, you know.

860
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:14,120
Yeah, where's the traffic?

861
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:20,580
Often and I think I really needed this, so thank you for
bringing me out.

862
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:22,340
I had a really great time.

863
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:27,200
Don't you worry about it, Robert Robertson.

864
01:00:31,630 --> 01:00:33,010
How do you know my name?

865
01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:34,470
That's his name?

866
01:00:35,430 --> 01:00:36,550
Robert Robertson?

867
01:00:37,470 --> 01:00:39,070
Okay, I'll tell you.

868
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:40,430
But...

869
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:44,170
tell me how you ended up with yeah yeah

870
01:00:47,890 --> 01:00:56,490
it happened three times there's grandpa bobby then my dad
who i called dad but everyone else called robbie and then me

871
01:00:56,490 --> 01:01:06,230
robert robert i wanted to be taken seriously hmm family
tradition robbie the third they did it three times he died

872
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:11,490
in the suit before i was born That's when I took over.

873
01:01:12,510 --> 01:01:15,450
There was a little inheritance and the life insurance money.

874
01:01:17,350 --> 01:01:17,990
I'm so sorry.

875
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:18,710
That's smart.

876
01:01:18,890 --> 01:01:20,630
I think as a superhero, you should always take life
insurance.

877
01:01:21,270 --> 01:01:24,330
Just your run-of-the-mill sad superhero origin story.

878
01:01:25,110 --> 01:01:32,530
The family tradition, if there is one, is dying in that
suit, which I guess I don't have to worry about anymore.

879
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:36,970
What is it?

880
01:01:37,230 --> 01:01:40,230
I'm not quite drunk enough to share my origin story.

881
01:01:40,550 --> 01:01:45,410
yet, but but she never said how she knew.

882
01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:46,130
Definitely.

883
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:48,890

884
01:01:49,170 --> 01:01:50,150
How did she know?

885
01:01:51,550 --> 01:01:54,130
Bro, doxing is not a joking matter.

886
01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:02,230
Yeah.

887
01:02:02,530 --> 01:02:03,750

investment it'll take considerable time and money to get the
suit repaired and the missing pieces replaced plenty of time

01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:49,160
okay such an array of brave heroes to How could you possibly
pick just one?

931
01:05:49,540 --> 01:05:50,920
The fuck is brain, though?

932
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:54,920
This graph will show you what a hero does well and not so
well.

933
01:05:57,260 --> 01:06:04,220
Okay, charisma, combat, intelligent, vigor, mobility,
charisma.

934
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:08,900
A hero with a knack for vigor and combat looks right for the
job.

935
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,220
That sounds like me.

936
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:13,120
Phenomoman.

01:06:54,730 --> 01:06:56,570
They won't be sent out again until you do.

944
01:06:56,770 --> 01:06:57,010
All right.

945
01:06:57,170 --> 01:06:59,090
This is my nine to five job now.

946
01:07:01,290 --> 01:07:01,450

How did they do?

948
01:07:02,490 --> 01:07:03,610
A SDN's state of the art graph.

949
01:07:03,910 --> 01:07:07,370
We can see an analysis of what skills the call required.

950
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:07,790
Okay.

951
01:07:10,850 --> 01:07:14,670

Well, call.

953
01:07:19,030 --> 01:07:21,650
There's no such thing as a perfect fit.

954
01:07:22,050 --> 01:07:25,910
Use your intellect and your roster to your advantage.

955
01:07:26,390 --> 01:07:30,110
Okay, so I just need to make sure I get the best fit
possible.

956
01:07:30,450 --> 01:07:35,630
The more that my skills align with the needs of the job, the
more likely I am to succeed.

957
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:36,030
Okay.

958
01:07:38,110 --> 01:07:40,730
That seems easy enough.

959
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:41,970
Right?

960
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:49,210
Organized criminals, often led by figurehead supervillains,
are the scourge of Southern California.

assume these choices need the right skill remember each of
your hero's strengths and weaknesses.

984
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:01,600
A perfect dispatch.

985
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:03,220
You are a natural.

Who is?

1001
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:39,280
Speaking of traffic and going places, does SDN offer paid
time off to take vacations?

1002
01:10:40,180 --> 01:10:40,740
Of course.

1003
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:43,860
PTO accrues at a regular rate over time.

1004
01:10:43,940 --> 01:10:45,780
Wait, there's paid vacation too?

1005
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:48,960
As long as you discuss your schedule with your manager well
in advance.

1006
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:50,920
What the fuck is a PTO?

1007
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:52,620
Yeah, what the fuck is a PTO?

1008
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:53,960
Okay, okay, okay.

1009
01:10:54,020 --> 01:10:55,660
There's a giant monster attacking.

1010
01:10:55,780 --> 01:10:56,620
Oh, shit.

1011
01:10:56,860 --> 01:10:58,680
Oh, shit, what?

1012
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:00,040
Oh, shit.

1013
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:02,460
Don't worry, they'll be fine.

1014
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:05,500
I got time.

1015
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:07,960
I don't think sending the...

1016
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:09,640
Okay, um, alright, there you go.

1017
01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:13,600
The diabolical super villain El Diablo is attacking Los
Angeles General.

1018
01:11:13,780 --> 01:11:14,680
Oh, shit.

1019
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:16,780
It's one of my arch nemesis.

1020
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:17,760
Oh.

1021
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:18,320
El Diablo.

1022
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:20,920
That means the Diablo in stretch.

1023
01:11:21,940 --> 01:11:24,260
He must have been using the convoy ambush as a distraction.

1024
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:25,500
Okay, by the time.

1025
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:26,740
I can send one to each.

1026
01:11:26,860 --> 01:11:27,400
Oh, shit.

1027
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:28,080
No, he's a...

1028
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:29,100
Oh, no.

1029
01:11:30,020 --> 01:11:36,520
Speaking of hospitals, did you know SDN offers a robust
benefits package for all full-time employees?

1030
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:38,320
Do I get dental, too?

1031
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:40,340
All right, don't worry.

1032
01:11:40,420 --> 01:11:41,340
We can wait a little bit.

1033
01:11:41,420 --> 01:11:42,620
We'll put one... Oh, my God.

1034
01:11:42,940 --> 01:11:42,940
Okay.

1035
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:46,020
I need help getting to my doctor's appointment.

1036
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:47,500
Make case before... Oh, wait.

1037
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:48,380
That's mobility.

1038
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:49,400
All right.

1039
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:50,080
Clock this.

1040
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:51,420
Don't worry.

1041
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:52,560
Help this grandma.

1042
01:11:53,540 --> 01:11:54,040
Okay.

1043
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:55,060
There we go.

1044
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:56,260
El Diablo.

1045
01:11:56,460 --> 01:11:56,840

It has to be.

1051
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:30,580
There you go.

1052
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:31,860
There you go.

1053
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:33,360
We're so fine.

1054
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:34,260
We're so fine.

1055
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:35,240
They're returning.

1056
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:38,300
SDN values work-life balance.

1057
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:41,580
When the bell rings, your shift will end very soon.

1058
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:44,100
Alright, no, no, no.

1059
01:12:44,180 --> 01:12:45,140
Everything is fine.

1060
01:12:45,620 --> 01:12:46,560
Oh, no.

1061
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:47,920
Oh, no.

1062
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:48,320
It's okay.

1063
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:48,640
It's okay.

1064
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,260
We can... Oh, no.

1065
01:12:50,620 --> 01:12:51,220
It's okay.

1066
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:52,540
Everything... Oh, no.

1067
01:12:52,820 --> 01:12:53,200
It's okay.

1068
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:53,900
It's okay.

1069
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:54,440
It's okay.

1070
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:55,240
Oh, my guys.

1071
01:12:55,460 --> 01:13:00,800
Sometimes a hero can use their talents to tip the rough up
and round the goons.

1072
01:13:03,740 --> 01:13:04,660
Okay, there you go.

1073
01:13:09,070 --> 01:13:09,770
Did we do it?

1074
01:13:09,830 --> 01:13:09,910
Yeah!

1075
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:13,270
We saved the children!

1076
01:13:14,010 --> 01:13:16,590
The children are safe and sound.

1077
01:13:20,510 --> 01:13:21,110
Okay, that's fine.

1078
01:13:22,230 --> 01:13:23,050
Did we do it?

1079
01:13:24,890 --> 01:13:26,630
I forgot the check marks, guys.

1080
01:13:26,970 --> 01:13:28,010
Yay, we did it!

1081
01:13:28,130 --> 01:13:29,190
You crossed the road!

1082
01:13:29,770 --> 01:13:30,630
Okay, it's okay.

1083
01:13:30,650 --> 01:13:38,490
problems big and small we never ignore the people of the
city particularly the elderly speaking of retirement quick

1084
01:13:38,490 --> 01:13:51,690
question phenomenon yes but there are limitations how did
you you got the messages what's the point of your job it's

1085
01:13:51,690 --> 01:13:56,670
okay everything is fine we'll just fire him guys we'll

1086
01:14:00,650 --> 01:14:01,610
Call me justice.

1087
01:14:01,890 --> 01:14:02,170
Oh, God.

1088
01:14:02,810 --> 01:14:03,070
Oh, God.

1089
01:14:03,210 --> 01:14:04,370
We made it just in time.

1090
01:14:07,310 --> 01:14:07,830
Okay.

1091
01:14:08,030 --> 01:14:08,770
On your mark.

1092
01:14:09,070 --> 01:14:09,710
This is fine.

1093
01:14:10,650 --> 01:14:11,670
See, I told you guys.

1094
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:13,430
El Diablo's goons are running scared.

1095
01:14:13,670 --> 01:14:15,950
We're right on the heels of his sidekick, El Diolito.

1096
01:14:19,350 --> 01:14:21,210
How is this my fault?

1097
01:14:21,410 --> 01:14:26,590
His whole name is Sweet Talker, and somehow he didn't Sweet
Talk his way out of it.

1098
01:14:27,050 --> 01:14:30,270
Okay, back, survive the defeat and detain.

1099
01:14:32,250 --> 01:14:33,370
El Diablo.

1100
01:14:34,070 --> 01:14:35,770
Okay, we can wait a little bit.

1101
01:14:36,730 --> 01:14:38,250
We have time to wait a little bit.

1102
01:14:38,350 --> 01:14:39,510
Then we'll send him over.

1103
01:14:40,310 --> 01:14:40,670
All right.

1104
01:14:45,750 --> 01:14:47,290
Okay, it's fine.

1105
01:14:48,110 --> 01:14:50,110
You just need to rest a little bit.

1106
01:14:50,890 --> 01:14:53,750
All right, and then I'll send you in.

1107
01:14:54,970 --> 01:14:56,430
And then I'll send you in.

1108
01:14:56,430 --> 01:14:57,270
Excellent choice.

1109
01:14:57,510 --> 01:15:01,350
And then there's no way you guys can fuck this up.

1110
01:15:06,630 --> 01:15:22,250

1112
01:15:34,890 --> 01:15:35,750

1113
01:15:36,590 --> 01:15:37,370
Look, see?

1114
01:15:37,550 --> 01:15:38,310
He did it.

1115
01:15:38,570 --> 01:15:39,810
Our shift is done now.

1116
01:15:40,010 --> 01:15:40,670
It is time for one.

1117
01:15:40,670 --> 01:15:43,650
We just had, like, one or two person.

1118
01:15:44,530 --> 01:15:45,910
Only one or two people died.

1119
01:15:46,350 --> 01:15:50,930
I'm going to enhance my break time with some of the snack
offerings and our break room vending machines.

1120
01:15:51,130 --> 01:15:54,730
Every 10 seconds, someone dies in the world.

1121
01:15:54,830 --> 01:15:55,910
I hope to be seeing a lot more.

1122
01:15:55,930 --> 01:16:00,130
So, like, you know, and don't forget to be fun now.

1123
01:16:00,210 --> 01:16:01,490
Just happen to be his time.

1124
01:16:01,490 --> 01:16:02,450
Did he just say phenomenal?

1125
01:16:03,790 --> 01:16:05,670
Well, looks like I'm great at this.

1126
01:16:05,930 --> 01:16:06,570
Yeah, I'm so good.

1127
01:16:06,830 --> 01:16:08,770
That's going to be bad for your negotiating position.

1128
01:16:09,190 --> 01:16:10,550
Expect a lengthy...

1129
01:16:16,130 --> 01:16:17,330
Did I drool on you?

1130
01:16:18,610 --> 01:16:19,450
What am I?

1131
01:16:19,470 --> 01:16:20,930
Some kind of emergency dispatch?

1132
01:16:21,290 --> 01:16:22,550
Peter, thank you for this super chat.

1133
01:16:22,890 --> 01:16:23,010
Thank you, babe.

1134
01:16:23,910 --> 01:16:25,170
It makes sense, yeah.

1135
01:16:30,980 --> 01:16:33,060
Meet me at the SDN offices tomorrow.

1136
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:34,340
That's a date.

1137
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:35,700
I'm not done saving you yet.

1138
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:38,140
Bro, she can fix me.

1139
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:46,000
See, guys, the more pathetic I am, the more she's into me.

1140
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:48,180
She can fix me.

1141
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:50,780
Every 10 seconds, someone dies.

1142
01:16:50,900 --> 01:16:52,980
Ira Doki, hold my beer.

1143
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:54,480
Cameron, thank you.

1144
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:55,460
Super chat, thank you.

1145
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:55,700
Thank you.

1146
01:16:55,740 --> 01:16:56,000
Thank you.

1147
01:16:56,860 --> 01:16:57,480
Oh, my God.

1148
01:16:57,580 --> 01:16:59,060
He's a fat-ass dog.

1149
01:17:09,910 --> 01:17:10,730
Give him some cereal.

1150
01:17:10,830 --> 01:17:11,650
I'm going to make him fatter.

1151
01:17:16,410 --> 01:17:17,330
That's right.

1152
01:17:18,890 --> 01:17:20,310
at SDN are the best in the business.

1153
01:17:20,710 --> 01:17:24,870
I met a nice lady.

1154
01:17:26,830 --> 01:17:27,820
She wants to help us out.

1155
01:17:29,790 --> 01:17:31,230
Bro, I live like this.

1156
01:17:31,690 --> 01:17:32,390
Bro, you live like...

1157
01:17:32,390 --> 01:17:33,590
Bro, I didn't unpack...

1158
01:17:33,590 --> 01:17:34,630
Oh my god, he is me.

1159
01:17:36,150 --> 01:17:38,010
It's how he wins.

1160
01:17:42,230 --> 01:17:43,330
This is my house.

1161
01:17:43,690 --> 01:17:44,570
This is my apartment.

1162
01:17:47,010 --> 01:17:48,250
I'm so immersed.

1163
01:17:48,350 --> 01:17:49,530
I feel just like him.

1164
01:17:55,730 --> 01:17:58,450
Is there any after-credit scene or do I just continue?

1165
01:17:59,810 --> 01:18:00,850
You live like that?

1166
01:18:01,370 --> 01:18:03,350
I wish my apartment was that clean.

1167
01:18:05,630 --> 01:18:06,930
No, this is episode one.

1168
01:18:07,050 --> 01:18:07,630
It's episodic.

1169
01:18:07,810 --> 01:18:11,990
This is why I didn't play the game until all the episodes
are released because I hate episodic format.

1170
01:18:13,290 --> 01:18:15,530
I fucking hate the episodic format in general.

1171
01:18:16,350 --> 01:18:17,050
Oh, yeah, there you go.

1172
01:18:17,450 --> 01:18:18,790
Yeah, okay, it's a 50-50.

1173

we're literally living in a town where there's super

1182
01:19:48,860 --> 01:19:56,900
villains someone's gonna have to to help lift the burdens
life throws at us.

1183
01:19:57,860 --> 01:20:01,640
Let SDN be your rock so you can rock.

1184
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:06,040
SDN is not an insurance company and does not cover damages.

1185
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:11,500
She's definitely not making it to ban practice.

1186
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:15,460
Is SDN like a superhero union?

1187
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:17,020
Hmm?

1188
01:20:17,940 --> 01:20:19,540
No, just the commercial.

1189
01:20:19,900 --> 01:20:20,320
It was weird.

1190
01:20:20,740 --> 01:20:21,160
Weird.

1191
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:22,700
Yeah, right.

1192
01:20:23,660 --> 01:20:24,760
Oh, so it's like a union.

1193
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:25,480
Oh my God.

1194
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:27,420
even superheroes have a union?

1195
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:31,260
It's a... I'm joking.

1196
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:33,200
Oh, it's like a Corpo.

1197
01:20:33,940 --> 01:20:35,260
Oh, it's like an... Oh.

1198
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:38,280
I'm a Pharma fan, you might say.

1199
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:39,180
Yeah, he's phenomenal.

1200
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:41,200
He seems cool.

1201
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:42,720
Phenomenal even.

1202
01:20:43,580 --> 01:20:44,540
And quite the salesman.

1203
01:20:44,740 --> 01:20:45,320
Oh, yeah.

1204
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:47,740
I mean, he could sell snowballs to an Eskimo.

1205
01:20:48,780 --> 01:20:50,860
Is it not... Not cool to say?

1206
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:51,840
Snowman.

1207
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:54,180
He could sell snowballs to a snow...

1208
01:20:54,180 --> 01:20:54,500
Oh, my God.

1209
01:20:54,620 --> 01:20:55,100
I'm Corpo.

1210
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:57,520
Anyone made of snow.

1211
01:20:57,980 --> 01:21:00,220
Any color snow doesn't have to be white.

1212
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:02,360
God.

1213
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:04,780
Yeah.

1214
01:21:05,020 --> 01:21:06,940
Oh, so it's like a private security firm.

1215
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:09,060
Oh, wait, that's fucked.

1216
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:11,620
If I have to, like, hire someone to save me.

1217
01:21:11,660 --> 01:21:12,320
Just, yeah.

1218
01:21:12,460 --> 01:21:13,160
Okay, let me.

1219
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:14,620
Wait, how do they get paid?

1220
01:21:14,860 --> 01:21:16,480
Do, like, the civilians they save?

1221
01:21:17,060 --> 01:21:17,400
Pay them?

1222
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:20,540
I have so many questions.

1223
01:21:21,060 --> 01:21:22,360
No, I mean, yes.

1224
01:21:22,660 --> 01:21:23,640
But yes is more.

1225
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:25,820
My powers make everything wet.

1226
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:26,800
Wait, okay.

1227
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:27,200
Okay.

1228
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:29,070
Okay, I need a no.

1229
01:21:30,180 --> 01:21:31,220
Wait, they have to...

1230
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:33,560
It's a subscription, please.

1231
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:39,100
Guys, if you subscribe every month, it's like...

1232
01:21:39,100 --> 01:21:41,240
It's a monthly subscription.

1233
01:21:41,780 --> 01:21:48,300
Guys, if you guys don't want to fucking die, make sure to
monthly subscribe to the superhero perk.

1234
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:49,040
That is...

1235
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:49,380
Fuck.

1236
01:21:49,900 --> 01:21:51,200
Wait, that is...

1237
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:53,320
I was clearly not paying too much.

1238
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:54,640
No, I'm so confused.

1239
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:55,960
I was like, subscribers?

1240
01:21:56,260 --> 01:21:58,680
Like, I was like, What do you mean subscribers?

1241
01:21:58,900 --> 01:22:01,280
So it's actually a private security firm.

1242
01:22:01,660 --> 01:22:03,680
Dude, is there any superheroes that do...

1243
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:05,160
It's like a public defendant.

1244
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:08,560
You know how like criminals, they are...

1245
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:10,260
They have the right for a lawyer.

1246
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:13,660
Are there superheroes that like, you know, do it for
charity?

1247
01:22:15,660 --> 01:22:18,800
Is there like public superheroes, you know?

1248
01:22:19,020 --> 01:22:21,820
Like you might have to wait like two to three...

1249
01:22:21,820 --> 01:22:24,460
Like five to ten business days.

1250
01:22:24,620 --> 01:22:25,880
Oh, that's what Mecca...

1251
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:27,140
No wonder I was broke.

1252
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:32,340
how they call me but yes i am here it was okay that makes
sense now

1253
01:22:36,830 --> 01:22:38,310
oh there's plan b

1254
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:51,700
that's crazy a subscription bro it's like you're like
dangling off the bridge and you're like sorry you forgot to

1255
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:59,420

1258
01:23:19,940 --> 01:23:26,220

host is just sad what's happening right now we don't want

1260
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:39,580
too many people knowing you missed the subscription former
heroes but it's better if you keep your identity a secret

1261
01:23:39,580 --> 01:23:51,720
we've had incidents in the past here what i remembered you
being bigger i was a little drunk listen it's gonna be great

1262
01:23:51,720 --> 01:24:01,620
i've never felt silly wearing this until now yeah i was
trying to imply that with the silence It worked.

1263
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:02,380
Get dressed.

1264
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:05,690
I also think superhero costumes are pretty silly.

1265
01:24:06,940 --> 01:24:08,780
Whoa, why is she watching?

1266
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:09,900
Whoa!

1270
01:24:14,780 --> 01:24:16,260
Is this an HR violation?

1271
01:24:16,580 --> 01:24:20,000
This might be the fastest HR violation of a new employee in
history.

1272
01:24:20,740 --> 01:24:21,240
Whoa!

1273
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:23,120

Oh, shit.

1276
01:24:27,740 --> 01:24:30,900

01:26:33,380 --> 01:26:34,240
Best by Fight Club?

1306
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:36,500
Bro, you have asthma.

1307
01:26:36,820 --> 01:26:38,000
That ain't fucking...

01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,380
That ain't fucking...

1309
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:41,460
Tough, bro.

1310
01:26:42,060 --> 01:26:44,120
It's not tough when you have asthma.

1311
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:46,240
And she's at the bottom.

1312
01:26:46,540 --> 01:26:49,300
She called herself Invisibitch when she was a villain.

1313
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:50,540
Bro, she looked down.

1314
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:51,240
You saw that.

1315
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:54,480
Yeah, I thought Invisibelle felt kind of corny for her.

1316
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:55,440
You saw her look down.

1317
01:26:56,160 --> 01:26:57,280
Her eyes flicked down.

1318
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:58,620
Just get your shirt on, Dad Bod.

1319
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:02,920
We have a six-pack.

1320
01:27:13,630 --> 01:27:15,030
Reminds me of the Incredibles.

1321
01:27:15,890 --> 01:27:17,790
But we've got what makes the real difference.

1322
01:27:18,270 --> 01:27:18,790
Great people.

1323
01:27:19,490 --> 01:27:21,530
Some of them aren't even people, and they're still great.

1324
01:27:23,770 --> 01:27:25,390
Oh my god, this is depressing.

1325
01:27:25,970 --> 01:27:28,330
Facts, scan does literally everything.

1326
01:27:28,510 --> 01:27:29,610
This is so depressing.

1327
01:27:30,970 --> 01:27:33,110
This is an actual nine-to-five office work.

1328
01:27:34,050 --> 01:27:37,870
I used to call it triple Ds, but I was informed that had a
different connotation.

1329
01:27:38,530 --> 01:27:39,050
3Ds?

1330
01:27:40,050 --> 01:27:40,570
3Ds?

1331
01:27:40,930 --> 01:27:41,290
Dispatching.

1332
01:27:43,210 --> 01:27:43,730
Documentation...

1333
01:27:43,730 --> 01:27:44,990
Diversity is the third.

1334
01:27:45,510 --> 01:27:47,170
Not in terms of priority, of course.

1335
01:27:48,030 --> 01:27:48,130
Yep.

1336
01:27:48,790 --> 01:27:49,930
We're all about diversity.

1337
01:27:50,390 --> 01:27:51,690
Lana works in the mailroom.

1338
01:27:52,170 --> 01:27:53,630
From a different galaxy altogether.

1339
01:27:54,630 --> 01:27:55,510
And then there's Galen.

1340
01:27:55,910 --> 01:27:56,490
Way back there.

1341
01:27:56,970 --> 01:27:57,970
Born with Superhearing.

1342
01:27:58,310 --> 01:27:58,950
He's from...

1343
01:27:59,570 --> 01:28:00,730
Oh, I want to see...

1344
01:28:01,770 --> 01:28:01,870

Cool.

1382
01:30:17,270 --> 01:30:18,690

01:30:19,010 --> 01:30:19,350
Nah, bro.

1384
01:30:19,370 --> 01:30:21,150
Bro, why is everyone doxing me?

1385
01:30:21,150 --> 01:30:22,470
Just touch my pants with underwear only.

1386
01:30:23,770 --> 01:30:24,610
I just do like this.

1387
01:30:29,780 --> 01:30:31,440
Can you show me again?

1388
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:32,620
I don't think I got it.

1389
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,300
Oh, you fixed our suit.

1390
01:30:39,180 --> 01:30:40,140
Holy shit.

1391
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:41,420
Who's this freckled face?

1392
01:30:42,540 --> 01:30:43,160
How are you?

1393
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:45,500
That's an aggressive way to greet someone.

1394
01:30:46,180 --> 01:30:48,080
Look at this skinny latte prick.

1395
01:30:48,540 --> 01:30:49,460
Your bones, kid.

1396
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,340
You here to whip these assholes in the shape or what?

1397
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:53,440
That's the idea.

1398
01:30:54,020 --> 01:30:54,800
Do I know you?

1399
01:30:55,140 --> 01:30:55,840
I'm sorry.

1400
01:30:56,040 --> 01:30:56,780
Do I know you?

1401
01:30:57,380 --> 01:30:58,120
Why are you all tense?

1402
01:30:58,520 --> 01:30:58,720
What?

1403
01:30:59,020 --> 01:31:00,200
It's a hug, not a handjob.

1404
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:02,280
We're already reminded of that Moana guy.

1405
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:03,520
I'm still confused.

1406
01:31:04,020 --> 01:31:04,460
Oh, right.

1407
01:31:04,700 --> 01:31:05,600
Because I'm old as shit.

1408
01:31:06,180 --> 01:31:06,760
How about this?

1409
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:08,020

1412
01:31:11,580 --> 01:31:12,080
I thought he was jabbing.

1413
01:31:12,460 --> 01:31:14,720
Why are you accepting hugs from old men you don't know?

1414
01:31:15,480 --> 01:31:17,500
Oh, and hey, they call me Chase around you.

1415
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:18,640
Yeah, it reminds me of Maui.

1416

1417
01:31:20,120 --> 01:31:20,820
Yeah, Chase.

1418
01:31:21,140 --> 01:31:22,760
It's been what, 10, 15 years?

1419
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:24,180
Has it really been that long?

1420

I extinguished the light from his eyes.

1429
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:30,040
Was he always like this?

1430
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:31,600
Yes, actually.

1431
01:32:32,200 --> 01:32:33,920
We joke, we laugh, we suppress our trauma.

1432
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:35,720
All right, enough of this feeling shit.

1433
01:32:36,060 --> 01:32:37,580
Let's introduce you to your team of losers.

1434
01:32:40,620 --> 01:32:41,740
Our team of losers?

1435
01:32:44,980 --> 01:32:49,100
Now, if I'm being honest, I thought and still think we
should have canned these tuners months ago.

1436
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:50,400
And you might get your wish.

1437
01:32:50,780 --> 01:32:54,160
Because if we don't see improvements soon, the whole program
will be scrapped.

1438
01:32:54,280 --> 01:32:55,020
Come zipped here.

01:33:35,620 --> 01:33:37,100
Didn't you ever run in with him years back?

1450

We need that.

1451
01:33:38,240 --> 01:33:39,920
We need a cyber bully.

1452
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:46,140
None of these are as important.

1453
01:33:46,300 --> 01:33:46,640
In Visigal.

It's crazy.

1457
01:33:50,620 --> 01:33:53,480
I entered the program on a condition we didn't ask
questions.

1458
01:33:53,640 --> 01:33:55,100
That's a little suspicious now.

Wait, that's cool.

1569
01:43:06,190 --> 01:43:07,650
So we're going to shut up about it.

01:43:07,910 --> 01:43:08,070
Yeah?

1571
01:43:08,530 --> 01:43:09,770
She can blot in them.

1572
01:43:09,850 --> 01:43:11,730
We needed another backup dancer.

1573
01:43:12,390 --> 01:43:12,910
So...

1574
01:43:12,910 --> 01:43:13,250
All right.

1575
01:43:13,690 --> 01:43:15,550
I feel like that's diplomatically.

1576
01:43:18,010 --> 01:43:18,430
All right, let's go.

1577
01:43:18,810 --> 01:43:20,010
As fast as these legs will let me.

1578
01:43:20,750 --> 01:43:21,370
What's this?

1579
01:43:22,110 --> 01:43:22,770
We're going to sign?

1580
01:43:22,950 --> 01:43:23,630
Oh, okay.

1581
01:43:23,710 --> 01:43:25,210
So it just reads their information.

1582
01:43:25,510 --> 01:43:25,930
All right.

1583
01:43:26,090 --> 01:43:27,430
Progress at the yacht club.

1584
01:43:28,210 --> 01:43:30,670
Pursue to return the boat in one piece.

1585
01:43:30,750 --> 01:43:31,010
Okay.

1586
01:43:31,710 --> 01:43:32,930
I think you can do it.

1587
01:43:33,950 --> 01:43:34,910
You're fine.

1588
01:43:36,110 --> 01:43:37,250
You're fast as fuck.

1589
01:43:38,590 --> 01:43:39,190
Let me show you.

1590
01:43:41,270 --> 01:43:41,870
100%.

1591
01:43:41,870 --> 01:43:42,370
Let's go.

1592
01:43:42,670 --> 01:43:43,030
Look at that.

1593
01:43:43,310 --> 01:43:43,330
Easy.

1594
01:43:43,470 --> 01:43:44,250
I told you guys.

1595
01:43:44,870 --> 01:43:45,130
See?

1596
01:43:46,030 --> 01:43:46,810
Good job, Sonar.

1597
01:43:47,050 --> 01:43:48,330
What's going on with Sonar?

1598
01:43:48,770 --> 01:43:48,830
Oh.

1599
01:43:48,890 --> 01:43:56,490
Sonar transforms his intelligence swaps with combat and his
charisma swaps with vigor until the next time.

1600
01:43:56,510 --> 01:43:58,790
We are working on controlling it.

1601
01:43:59,850 --> 01:44:00,610
Oh, that's fine.

1602
01:44:00,750 --> 01:44:01,190

1603
01:44:01,190 --> 01:44:02,950

That sounds hardcore as fuck.

1612
01:44:43,790 --> 01:44:45,770

01:44:46,250 --> 01:44:47,050

01:45:35,850 --> 01:45:36,430
I'm on break.

1627
01:45:36,790 --> 01:45:39,170
Okay, let's fire can be fixed later.

1628
01:45:39,710 --> 01:45:40,830
Okay, stop fucking around.

1629
01:45:41,010 --> 01:45:43,270
I've got enough problems without you making new ones.

1630
01:45:43,390 --> 01:45:43,830
Oh, it's 63.

1631

Whatever, man.

1632
01:45:45,090 --> 01:45:45,610
Is that it?

1633
01:45:45,790 --> 01:45:46,230
No!

1634
01:45:47,610 --> 01:45:48,130
How?

1635
01:45:49,350 --> 01:45:50,070
Oh, it's okay.

1636
01:45:50,170 --> 01:45:51,850
There's no one alive on the boat anyway.

1637
01:45:52,070 --> 01:45:52,470
It's fine.

1638
01:45:53,130 --> 01:45:54,790
Jenny, the Bone Zone Diaz here.

1639
01:45:55,070 --> 01:45:59,950
Today's topic is all about SDN hiring criminals to protect
us.

1640
01:46:00,270 --> 01:46:00,530
Wrong.

1641
01:46:01,510 --> 01:46:02,510
Oh, shit.

1642
01:46:03,610 --> 01:46:04,070
Shit.

1643
01:46:04,350 --> 01:46:05,090
Okay, we'll wait for it.

1644
01:46:05,230 --> 01:46:06,730
We'll wait for him to come back.

1645
01:46:07,590 --> 01:46:09,790
Um, maybe.

1646
01:46:10,370 --> 01:46:11,610
He can throw clay at it.

1647
01:46:12,750 --> 01:46:13,550
Oh, shit.

1648
01:46:16,830 --> 01:46:16,830
Hack.

1649
01:46:16,950 --> 01:46:18,010
We're gonna hack the system.

1650
01:46:18,610 --> 01:46:19,630
I got you guys.

1651
01:46:20,150 --> 01:46:22,410
I got my PC, my wooden keyboard.

1652
01:46:22,550 --> 01:46:23,590
I can hack this.

1653
01:46:24,330 --> 01:46:25,590
As long as I'm not timed.

1654
01:46:25,890 --> 01:46:26,610
I'm timed.

1655
01:46:31,150 --> 01:46:33,050
I had one criteria.

1656
01:46:37,110 --> 01:46:37,630
Okay.

1657
01:46:41,090 --> 01:46:42,110
I'm timed.

1658
01:46:42,610 --> 01:46:43,490
Who would have thought?

1659
01:46:47,990 --> 01:46:48,310
Okay.

1660
01:46:52,070 --> 01:46:53,450
We're so done.

1661
01:46:55,970 --> 01:46:56,190
Oh.

1662
01:46:57,370 --> 01:46:59,830
Oh, if I messed up one, I didn't even realize that.

1663
01:47:00,450 --> 01:47:01,550
There you go, we did it.

1664
01:47:02,890 --> 01:47:03,470
No pressure.

1665
01:47:03,590 --> 01:47:04,510
No pressure at all.

1666
01:47:04,830 --> 01:47:05,870
We found it.

1667
01:47:05,890 --> 01:47:06,910
You never have too many soft skills.

1668
01:47:08,690 --> 01:47:10,250
Hey, a hero ranked up.

1669
01:47:10,510 --> 01:47:11,410
Oh, did he?

1670
01:47:12,310 --> 01:47:13,150
What did he do?

1671
01:47:13,530 --> 01:47:13,870
Upgrade?

1672
01:47:13,870 --> 01:47:15,510
Every rank up earns skill points.

1673
01:47:16,550 --> 01:47:17,810
Use them for increasing stats.

1674
01:47:18,050 --> 01:47:19,110
What do we want, anyway?

1675
01:47:19,690 --> 01:47:21,750
Uh, let's have more...

1676
01:47:21,750 --> 01:47:26,210
You could be more smart, actually.

1677
01:47:27,310 --> 01:47:28,090
What do we want?

1678
01:47:28,330 --> 01:47:29,390
Do we want charisma?

1679
01:47:30,510 --> 01:47:31,310
Or mobility?

1680
01:47:32,550 --> 01:47:33,070
Intelligent?

1681
01:47:33,290 --> 01:47:34,150
All right, let's do intelligent.

1682
01:47:34,830 --> 01:47:45,650

1687
01:48:12,790 --> 01:48:13,870
Going now!

1688
01:48:14,070 --> 01:48:17,170
Track down members to find their hide up.

1689
01:48:17,970 --> 01:48:18,250
Maybe?

1690
01:48:19,090 --> 01:48:19,730
Yeah, okay.

1691
01:48:20,930 --> 01:48:24,610
Well, we have to track them down, wouldn't you... Maybe

Ag and Mobility.

1695
01:48:30,610 --> 01:48:34,150
I feel like you need intelligence, but none of them are
smart in my crew.

1696
01:48:34,990 --> 01:48:36,210
This is a little bit.

1697
01:48:36,330 --> 01:48:36,630
This is bad.

1698
01:48:36,810 --> 01:48:38,730
I don't have any smart people in my crew.

1699
01:48:39,090 --> 01:48:40,250
Alright, we can wait a little bit.

1700
01:48:41,510 --> 01:48:41,990
Disrupted?

1701
01:48:42,850 --> 01:48:43,810
Use your body.

1702
01:48:45,390 --> 01:48:46,430
Just use your body.

1703
01:48:46,530 --> 01:48:47,270
You're made of clay.

1704
01:48:47,370 --> 01:48:47,930
You're fine.

1705
01:48:54,240 --> 01:48:55,020
Oh, thank God.

Oh, thank God.

01:49:03,640 --> 01:49:04,720
Okay, there we go.

1711
01:49:05,940 --> 01:49:06,420

That little shit I wanted behind you.

1724
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,940
Track down and encourage him to turn his life around.

1725
01:50:46,380 --> 01:50:47,340
Gosh, okay.

1726
01:50:52,320 --> 01:50:54,160
We'll think about it.

1727
01:50:54,440 --> 01:50:54,680
All right.

1728
01:50:54,760 --> 01:50:55,060
It's okay.

1729
01:50:55,100 --> 01:50:55,640
He's resting.

1730
01:50:56,960 --> 01:50:57,620
All right, there you go.

1731
01:51:00,040 --> 01:51:02,620
I don't know if you should meet his hero while he's a...

1732
01:51:02,620 --> 01:51:03,080
You know what?

1733
01:51:03,180 --> 01:51:03,640
Fuck it.

1734
01:51:03,720 --> 01:51:04,640
Never meet your heroes.

1735
01:51:04,780 --> 01:51:04,780
Sure.

1736
01:51:05,100 --> 01:51:05,560
Go ahead.

1737
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:08,400
You will not regret this.

1738
01:51:08,980 --> 01:51:10,060
Never meet your heroes.

1739
01:51:10,260 --> 01:51:12,960
I didn't think I would until you said that.

1740
01:51:13,040 --> 01:51:13,320
Alright.

1741
01:51:13,880 --> 01:51:14,660
He's gotta learn.

1742
01:51:15,300 --> 01:51:15,560
Guys.

1743
01:51:16,040 --> 01:51:17,960
He's gotta learn to never meet his heroes.

1744
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:19,440
He'll...

1745
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:20,400
JLV.

1746
01:51:20,680 --> 01:51:21,320
Go for it.

1747
01:51:21,360 --> 01:51:22,600
Guys, he's a Harvard graduate.

1748
01:51:25,480 --> 01:51:27,180
He's gonna learn today.

1749
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:30,340
Self and use and will be key.

1750
01:51:30,460 --> 01:51:30,660
Okay.

1751
01:51:30,820 --> 01:51:32,020
It's well guarded.

1752
01:51:32,860 --> 01:51:33,140
Oh.

1753
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:36,960
We'll send these two.

1754
01:51:37,060 --> 01:51:37,980
We'll send them both together.

1755
01:51:39,140 --> 01:51:41,220
How long was the last dispatcher here?

1756
01:51:41,240 --> 01:51:41,920
Two days.

1757
01:51:42,520 --> 01:51:43,260
Two days.

1758
01:51:43,480 --> 01:51:43,980
Yeah, no shit.

1759
01:51:44,120 --> 01:51:44,920
How the fuck did that happen?

1760
01:51:45,760 --> 01:51:46,540
Oh, the nerves.

1761
01:51:46,640 --> 01:51:48,700
And he's second guessing his human meat alternative.

1762
01:51:49,560 --> 01:51:50,940
How's make it relate?

1763
01:51:51,180 --> 01:51:51,560
Just wait.

1764
01:51:51,620 --> 01:51:52,020
Oh, God.

1765
01:51:55,280 --> 01:51:56,240
Oh, fuck.

1766
01:51:57,120 --> 01:51:57,780
I don't know.

1767
01:51:57,840 --> 01:51:59,560
I don't know if he is relatable, guys.

1768
01:51:59,620 --> 01:52:00,640
He's a Harvard graduate.

1769
01:52:00,760 --> 01:52:02,780
It's really hard to make it relatable.

1770
01:52:06,940 --> 01:52:08,960
Should you wing it or make it relatable?

1771
01:52:08,980 --> 01:52:22,300
it he's not he's not really oh just tell a story oh god uh

any of that right now story is bad guys which one is it okay

1773
01:52:30,900 --> 01:52:33,820

1781
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:46,440
Tell the kid he'll go to hell.

1782
01:53:50,460 --> 01:53:51,240
Alright, nice.

1783
01:53:51,820 --> 01:53:52,460
What the fuck?

1784
01:53:54,120 --> 01:53:55,240
Granies, I got this.

1785
01:53:55,580 --> 01:53:56,020
Hold up.

1786
01:53:56,180 --> 01:53:57,100
Aren't you banned?

1787
01:53:57,680 --> 01:53:58,860
Yeah, and I gotta get unbanned.

1788
01:53:59,540 --> 01:54:00,620
Wait, do we put her in?

1789
01:54:01,580 --> 01:54:02,720
Yeah, nice try, dude.

1790
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:03,840
I'm not going anywhere.

1791
01:54:04,220 --> 01:54:04,880
Oh, shit.

1792
01:54:06,860 --> 01:54:08,240
Oh, I have to put her in.

1793
01:54:08,540 --> 01:54:08,560
Okay.

1794
01:54:08,560 --> 01:54:09,820
You know, I'm not going for you.

1795
01:54:10,220 --> 01:54:11,500
I'm going because I have to.

1796
01:54:11,980 --> 01:54:15,340
Ascent reduces travel time and call completion time.

1797
01:54:17,020 --> 01:54:18,840
He just really likes grannies, I guess.

1798
01:54:20,080 --> 01:54:21,280
Anything I could level up?

1799
01:54:22,540 --> 01:54:23,200
No, okay.

1800
01:54:23,940 --> 01:54:25,240
Can I get ice down here, please?

1801
01:54:25,860 --> 01:54:26,540
What does that mean?

1802
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:27,060
What?

1803
01:54:27,060 --> 01:54:27,820
She asked before tapping.

1804
01:54:28,540 --> 01:54:32,000
We got access to security cams of SDN subscribers all over
our territory.

1805
01:54:32,300 --> 01:54:32,520
Wow.

1806
01:54:32,780 --> 01:54:33,080
Really?

1807
01:54:33,220 --> 01:54:34,020
Is that legal?

1808
01:54:34,180 --> 01:54:34,940
Don't ask questions.

1809
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:36,760
Just always make sure to read the fine print.

1810
01:54:37,180 --> 01:54:39,080
Didn't know you were a fellow monster.

1811
01:54:39,620 --> 01:54:41,960

Thank Christ.

1826
01:55:51,700 --> 01:55:52,960
I didn't want to have to lift this guy.

1827
01:55:53,460 --> 01:55:55,360
So, can I go now?

1828
01:55:55,480 --> 01:55:56,820
No, this isn't a wellness check.

1829
01:55:56,920 --> 01:55:57,580
It's a B&E.

1830
01:55:57,680 --> 01:55:59,160
Let's figure out if the PURP is still there.

1831
01:55:59,180 --> 01:55:59,520
PURP?

01:55:59,800 --> 01:56:00,220
B&E?

01:56:00,720 --> 01:56:01,400
Okay, Lieutenant.

01:56:56,620 --> 01:57:04,140
good donut shop if there's no one there bro there's no one
even in this donut shop oh my god it's money laundering

1844
01:57:04,140 --> 01:57:04,720
isn't it

1845
01:57:09,020 --> 01:57:22,460
here isn't he why does a donut shop even need extra exactly
that's what i'm saying there's nobody even eating here what

1846
01:57:22,460 --> 01:57:36,880
what the what do i do this that's odd oh

1847
01:57:43,140 --> 01:57:45,960
the key oh Oh!

1848
01:57:49,220 --> 01:57:53,620
I thought it was one of those, like, guest things where,
like, if you get a thing right, uh...

1849
01:57:53,620 --> 01:57:55,280
This code represents a code to use later.

1850
01:57:55,560 --> 01:57:56,000
Remember it.

1851
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:56,280
Okay.

1852
01:57:56,720 --> 01:57:58,020
Up, down, left, left.

1853
01:57:58,280 --> 01:57:58,280
Okay.

1854
01:57:58,420 --> 01:58:00,220
Up, down, left, left.

1855
01:58:00,320 --> 01:58:02,140
I thought it was one of those, like... It's, like, Wordle.

1856
01:58:02,320 --> 01:58:03,220
I thought it was Wordle.

1857
01:58:03,640 --> 01:58:05,540
God, the dude thought it was Wordle.

1858
01:58:07,580 --> 01:58:09,740
It would have been smart if it was Wordle.

1859
01:58:10,060 --> 01:58:10,600
What we got here?

1860
01:58:11,340 --> 01:58:12,380
Perp, V&E.

1861
01:58:12,700 --> 01:58:13,960
Who are you, Lieutenant Dan?

1862
01:58:15,280 --> 01:58:16,040
Sack, you're not alone.

1863
01:58:20,140 --> 01:58:20,980
What's this?

1864
01:58:22,100 --> 01:58:23,720
He's coming your way, armed.

1865
01:58:23,960 --> 01:58:24,780
You need to disappear.

1866
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:26,520
Why are you whispering, you idiot?

1867
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:27,760
You're in my ear.

1868
01:58:27,860 --> 01:58:28,360
No, now!

1869
01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:34,460
Is this shroud?

1870
01:58:39,670 --> 01:58:40,490
Oh, shit.

1871
01:58:41,750 --> 01:58:43,090
It's defense this now.

1872
01:58:43,250 --> 01:58:44,330
Oh, wait, he asked his other thing.

1873
01:58:44,410 --> 01:58:45,170
It's just a gusher.

1874
01:58:47,130 --> 01:58:48,070
Be careful.

1875
01:58:48,730 --> 01:58:50,410
I got this lieutenant Dan.

1876
01:58:50,510 --> 01:58:51,150
Never mind.

1877
01:58:52,350 --> 01:58:59,090
Oh He has like a name by eye cheating Got any more great
advice?

1878
01:58:59,810 --> 01:59:00,130
Oh shit.

1879
01:59:00,410 --> 01:59:01,910
No, it's her deep up asthma.

1880
01:59:02,250 --> 01:59:08,330
Oh Stupid I was watching to cut teeth

1881
01:59:11,650 --> 01:59:23,230
Shit I want a donut too.

1882
01:59:27,050 --> 01:59:27,850
Oh shit!

1883
01:59:28,430 --> 01:59:29,230
Invisible bitch!

1884
01:59:29,470 --> 01:59:30,250
Oh shit!

1885
01:59:31,270 --> 01:59:31,530
Invisible!

1886
01:59:32,130 --> 01:59:33,850
Just hold him off while you find a way to help.

1887
01:59:36,270 --> 01:59:37,130
Oh, am I hacking?

1888
01:59:37,810 --> 01:59:40,630
I can use the overhead sprinklers to short out his blaster.

1889
01:59:41,950 --> 01:59:43,010
Oh shit, oh I'm timed.

1890
01:59:43,150 --> 01:59:45,290
Okay, I was gonna say as long as I'm not timed, it'll be
fine.

1891
01:59:47,890 --> 01:59:48,770
Why?

1892
01:59:49,850 --> 01:59:50,490
Got him.

1893
01:59:52,010 --> 01:59:52,250
What?

1894
01:59:53,710 --> 01:59:53,950
Okay.

1895
01:59:54,310 --> 01:59:54,850
Up down.

1896
01:59:55,850 --> 01:59:56,350
Up down.

1897
02:00:01,060 --> 02:00:01,920
Oh?

1898
02:00:03,220 --> 02:00:04,460
Oh shit.

1899
02:00:05,840 --> 02:00:06,280
Up down.

1900
02:00:07,020 --> 02:00:09,320
Okay, what's this?

1901
02:00:10,420 --> 02:00:18,960

1903
02:00:23,400 --> 02:00:24,100
Wait, why am I doing that?

1904
02:00:24,140 --> 02:00:25,200
I should be using you guys.

1905
02:00:30,500 --> 02:00:31,300
Oh my.

1906
02:00:32,760 --> 02:00:33,160
Nice.

1907
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:34,720
Water badge.

1908
02:00:37,580 --> 02:00:39,120
I should have been using at chat.

1909
02:00:50,280 --> 02:00:51,160
Oh, fuck.

1910
02:00:51,440 --> 02:00:52,280
No, my asthma.

1911
02:00:58,480 --> 02:00:59,220
Who's that?

1912
02:00:59,480 --> 02:01:00,200
Who came in?

1913
02:01:00,480 --> 02:01:00,720
Phenomenal.

1914
02:01:00,920 --> 02:01:01,640
Oh, granny!

1915
02:01:03,020 --> 02:01:05,140
I don't think you know how to use that thing, so why don't
you...

1916
02:01:05,140 --> 02:01:06,280
Shut the fuck up!

1917
02:01:06,520 --> 02:01:07,840
Oh, I'm one of the good guys.

1918
02:01:08,180 --> 02:01:08,480
You?

1919
02:01:08,880 --> 02:01:09,520
Yeah, right.

1920
02:01:09,720 --> 02:01:11,160
Don't fuck with me, okay?

1921
02:01:12,040 --> 02:01:13,160
Nobody fucks, granny.

1922
02:01:13,520 --> 02:01:14,020
Oh, shit.

1923
02:01:14,040 --> 02:01:14,380
Shit!

1924
02:01:17,640 --> 02:01:20,000
Great fucking advice, Lieutenant Dan.

1925
02:01:20,200 --> 02:01:21,360
You're not calling me, Lieutenant Dan.

1926
02:01:21,360 --> 02:01:22,160
Take out the thief.

1927
02:01:22,300 --> 02:01:23,620
The show doesn't work and you shout dumb.

1928
02:01:24,140 --> 02:01:25,920
Granny doesn't even know how to shoot that thing.

1929
02:01:26,320 --> 02:01:27,340
Yeah, I don't trust him.

1930
02:01:27,480 --> 02:01:29,140
He's the only one with this finger on a trigger.

1931
02:01:29,260 --> 02:01:29,620
You know what?

1932
02:01:29,940 --> 02:01:31,040
It's my life on the line.

1933
02:01:31,340 --> 02:01:32,640
I'm done listening to you.

1934
02:01:33,200 --> 02:01:36,740
The thing's gonna blow that man's arm off and there's a
whole building with me in it.

1935
02:01:36,980 --> 02:01:38,320
Fuck off, I'm disarming the device.

1936
02:01:38,520 --> 02:01:40,620
No, Invisig out, that's a direct order.

1937
02:01:40,840 --> 02:01:42,180
Wait, she doesn't even care?

1938
02:01:44,040 --> 02:01:44,280
What?

1939
02:01:44,700 --> 02:01:46,560
I- He didn't even listen to me!

1940
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:48,040
Bro!

1941
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:49,820
Oh, fuck.

1942
02:01:50,280 --> 02:01:50,560
Fuck.

1943
02:01:51,820 --> 02:01:52,700
Invisiga, you there?

1944
02:01:52,920 --> 02:01:54,200
Oh, shit, that's his dick.

1945
02:01:54,520 --> 02:01:55,320
Oh, his ass?

1946
02:01:55,760 --> 02:01:57,140
Fuck, this guy's heavy.

1947
02:01:58,080 --> 02:02:00,340
Granny's clearly a fan of- She's gone rogue!

1948
02:02:01,320 --> 02:02:05,370
Oh, he's kind of caked up.

1949
02:02:06,130 --> 02:02:11,840
I think he must have had something else to do, because he
left.

1950
02:02:15,350 --> 02:02:16,390
I mean...

1951
02:02:16,390 --> 02:02:17,790
Oh, wait, does he have life insurance?

1952
02:02:18,190 --> 02:02:19,090
Oh, he's alive?

1953
02:02:20,830 --> 02:02:22,590
You think he'll still be subscribed?

1954
02:02:23,930 --> 02:02:26,890
Guys, do you think he'll cancel his subscription, guys?

1955
02:02:27,210 --> 02:02:30,250
Sometimes people, you know, get electrical burns.

1956
02:02:30,490 --> 02:02:32,130
She disobeyed a direct order.

1957
02:02:32,610 --> 02:02:33,410
Well, that's the problem.

1958
02:02:33,950 --> 02:02:35,590
This isn't the army and these ain't soldiers.

1959
02:02:35,830 --> 02:02:38,310
Guys, he's not going to unsubscribe, right?

1960
02:02:40,070 --> 02:02:41,950
Maybe if we send him one free month.

1961
02:02:42,750 --> 02:02:44,630
One free month, he'll stay on.

1962
02:02:45,810 --> 02:02:46,830
It's okay, guys.

1963
02:02:46,890 --> 02:02:47,990
We'll give him a voucher.

1964
02:02:48,170 --> 02:02:49,710
And if you're sorry, you got shot.

1965
02:02:50,070 --> 02:02:52,250
sure you're not actually 80 years old.

1966
02:02:53,310 --> 02:02:53,990
Sorry, you guys tried.

1967
02:02:54,030 --> 02:02:55,430
Here's one month free.

1968
02:02:58,650 --> 02:02:59,010
Alright.

1969
02:03:02,330 --> 02:03:03,130
Two failures?

1970
02:03:03,430 --> 02:03:05,270
It wasn't even my fault.

1971
02:03:06,810 --> 02:03:09,410
Bro, one of the failures wasn't even my fault.

1972
02:03:11,550 --> 02:03:13,890
You could hear out of resting.

1973
02:03:15,770 --> 02:03:16,950
About random point.

1974
02:03:22,270 --> 02:03:23,370

Whoa, shit.

What kind of superhero flinches?

1984
02:04:23,200 --> 02:04:24,680
I'm just a dispatcher.

1985
02:04:25,140 --> 02:04:25,500
I didn't think we were a superhero.

1986
02:04:25,860 --> 02:04:26,380
Chill out.

1987
02:04:28,140 --> 02:04:31,660
If you had people trying to kill you for the last 15 years,
you'd be jumpy, too.

1988
02:04:32,500 --> 02:04:34,340
What makes you think my life has been any different?

1989
02:04:34,800 --> 02:04:37,360
You think growing up surrounded by a bunch of shipbag
villains?

1990
02:04:37,560 --> 02:04:38,560
I didn't need to watch my back.

1991
02:04:39,140 --> 02:04:40,360

02:06:48,300 --> 02:06:49,380
What the fuck?

2013
02:06:52,280 --> 02:06:54,360
What happened to your nose?

2014
02:06:54,660 --> 02:06:54,760
Hmm?

2015
02:06:55,420 --> 02:06:56,180
There we go.

2016
02:06:56,720 --> 02:06:59,280
You have a tissue hanging from your nose, Robert.

2017
02:06:59,800 --> 02:07:01,580
I was trying to ignore it, but...

2018
02:07:01,580 --> 02:07:02,500
Yeah, so I'm gonna snitch.

2019
02:07:03,400 --> 02:07:03,840
I'm snitching.

2020
02:07:05,820 --> 02:07:07,360
Invisi got punched me in the face.

2021
02:07:07,780 --> 02:07:08,480
But I asked for it.

2022
02:07:08,920 --> 02:07:15,540
this is serious bro this game is so good i'm clearly got
here playing it thank you thank you i said i literally yeah

2023
02:07:15,540 --> 02:07:22,760
this is pretty enjoyable i've been enjoying the story so far
i he eats swings and i can't romance him exactly let's go

2024
02:07:22,760 --> 02:07:31,580
with that i'm a nerd roberts for a shift and aside from
whatever happened here i thought it was she punched me i'm

2025
02:07:31,580 --> 02:07:37,680
reporting to hr watching on the monitor the work you did
dispatching i don't think the z team has ever had a better

2026
02:07:37,680 --> 02:07:42,480
shift than that we just might need to confront the fact that
it might be the best they can do especially the way the

2027
02:07:42,480 --> 02:07:51,300
granny thing went yeah the z situation that wasn't ideal but
i've seen so much worse with invisigal let's be real she

2028
02:07:51,300 --> 02:07:58,960
ain't gonna make it she's difficult to work with sure but i
see a lot of promise in her really even the other z-teamers

2029
02:07:58,960 --> 02:08:05,560
respect her they're afraid of her i should have done better
maybe a couple wires got crossed toward the end there guys

2030
02:08:05,560 --> 02:08:12,100
what do you mean the romance option is god i'm gonna save it
okay i'll save it cost them for you i'm gonna save it you

2031
02:08:12,100 --> 02:08:19,820
should be proud the bar is very low with this group well
it's not low for me look i like to make a joke and keep

2032
02:08:19,820 --> 02:08:26,000
things light as much as the next person but when it comes to
where i could turn it around here if you want the phoenix

2033
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:32,920
program to survive the bar needs to go up and how would we
do that by treating the z team like what they are a bunch of

2034
02:08:32,920 --> 02:08:37,540
villains villain team takes a different approach than a
superhero team.

2035
02:08:37,980 --> 02:08:39,160
I need to be around them.

2036
02:08:39,580 --> 02:08:43,580
I need them to see I'm all in and they need to match that
energy.

2037
02:08:44,080 --> 02:08:44,640
Some tough love.

2038
02:08:44,960 --> 02:08:49,320
The only kind I know and based on what I've seen the only
version they'll respond to.

2039
02:08:50,080 --> 02:08:52,120
I'm not saying everyone will make it.

2040
02:08:52,340 --> 02:08:52,780
They won't.

2041
02:08:53,280 --> 02:08:54,860
I'm not saying it won't get spicy.

2042
02:08:55,200 --> 02:08:55,620
It will.

2043
02:08:56,140 --> 02:08:59,140
But when it does, I also need you to trust me to handle it.

2044
02:08:59,300 --> 02:09:00,580
I don't want you stepping in.

2045
02:09:00,600 --> 02:09:02,540
They need to respect me even if I

2046
02:09:08,260 --> 02:09:15,880
okay we'll do it your way monday we'll get them in a room
and introduce them to their new super villain leader as me i

2047
02:09:15,880 --> 02:09:21,480
can't promise at work i can only promise that i'll do my
best what if i like poached them and start my own company

2048
02:09:21,480 --> 02:09:27,400
way more fun to watch but then it's for like super villains
only so it's like people have to subscribe to us to make

2051
02:09:47,840 --> 02:09:55,880

2062
02:10:49,880 --> 02:10:51,340
I want you to have a contingent on you as a busy team.

2063
02:10:51,920 --> 02:10:53,360
I want to do that to you.

2064
02:10:54,520 --> 02:10:55,960
But don't worry about that.

2065
02:10:56,260 --> 02:10:56,680

2066
02:10:56,680 --> 02:10:58,320

2067
02:10:58,540 --> 02:10:58,960

02:10:59,640 --> 02:11:01,220
No, do you want to grab dinner?

2069
02:11:01,880 --> 02:11:04,620
Hey, so do you want to grab dinner or something?

02:11:04,780 --> 02:11:06,380
Like, as like platonic, you know?

2071
02:11:06,560 --> 02:11:08,060
Platonic friends, you know?

2072
02:11:09,360 --> 02:11:11,880
Actually, there's something I've been meaning to tell you.

2073
02:11:12,400 --> 02:11:16,600
It's a little awkward to mention, but since the other night,
I...

2074
02:11:16,600 --> 02:11:17,300
Blonde Blazer.

2075
02:11:18,300 --> 02:11:18,580
Hey.

2076
02:11:19,580 --> 02:11:20,740
Oh, it's that guy.

2077
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:21,240
He saw it.

2078
02:11:21,300 --> 02:11:23,400
He was in the commercial that we saw.

2079
02:11:24,580 --> 02:11:25,100
What?

2080
02:11:26,400 --> 02:11:27,720
Who is this?

2081
02:11:28,060 --> 02:11:30,820
I thought I'd catalogued all of your work companions.

2082
02:11:31,120 --> 02:11:32,320
You hoi!

2083
02:11:33,420 --> 02:11:36,120
Oh my god, it's so proud of music.

2084
02:11:37,060 --> 02:11:42,800
Bro, oh my god, Bowser Jr. Robert Robertson, leader of the
Phoenixes.

2085
02:11:43,120 --> 02:11:44,660
Blonde Blazer told me about you.

2086
02:11:45,180 --> 02:11:45,180
Really?

2087
02:11:45,580 --> 02:11:48,820
Did she say, I don't know, what came up in that talk?

2088
02:11:49,280 --> 02:11:53,060
She said you're a capable, honorable man that truly cares
for others.

2089
02:11:54,200 --> 02:11:55,220
Why are you so small?

2090
02:11:55,340 --> 02:11:56,320
Hey, come on.

2091
02:11:56,540 --> 02:11:57,460
You gotta stop asking people.

2092
02:11:57,460 --> 02:11:58,680
Oh, it's above average.

2093
02:12:00,440 --> 02:12:03,100
It's not about the size.

2094
02:12:03,340 --> 02:12:03,920
It's the flow.

2095
02:12:04,080 --> 02:12:05,400
It's all about how you use this.

2096
02:12:06,580 --> 02:12:08,860
Lack of size and strength and issue.

2097
02:12:09,120 --> 02:12:09,920
No, he was great.

2098
02:12:10,160 --> 02:12:10,800
It was great.

2099
02:12:10,920 --> 02:12:13,540
It was a great first day That is phenomenal.

2100
02:12:13,920 --> 02:12:20,900

2105
02:12:45,180 --> 02:12:46,420
Yeah, I think he would die.

2106
02:12:46,660 --> 02:12:47,100
Oh, no.

2107
02:12:47,960 --> 02:12:49,300
Perhaps another time.

02:12:49,620 --> 02:12:50,200

2109
02:12:52,640 --> 02:12:53,720

2110
02:12:53,800 --> 02:12:54,960
What do you mean, what the fuck?

2111
02:12:55,260 --> 02:12:55,920
What the fuck?

2112
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,440
Why did you not tell me you were dating him?

2113
02:12:58,760 --> 02:12:59,980
He flies a little faster.

2114
02:13:01,140 --> 02:13:04,420
Manly, you could have told me this like two days ago.

2115
02:13:04,560 --> 02:13:04,980
A pleasure.

2116
02:13:05,040 --> 02:13:06,540
Now, could you step back?

2117
02:13:06,560 --> 02:13:08,040
The power of my life.

2118
02:13:08,040 --> 02:13:10,200
She has no right to say what the fuck?

2119
02:13:12,920 --> 02:13:13,360
Phenomenal.

2120
02:13:14,500 --> 02:13:15,140
Oh, shit.

2121
02:13:15,340 --> 02:13:16,740
Yeah, he flies a lot faster.

2122
02:13:19,220 --> 02:13:20,780
There's no such thing as it's complicated.

2123
02:13:21,060 --> 02:13:22,720
Just be like, I'm dating someone.

2124
02:13:25,740 --> 02:13:26,760
What the fuck do you mean?

2125
02:13:27,200 --> 02:13:28,820
She said it's complicated.

2126
02:13:29,200 --> 02:13:30,420
You know what she could have said?

2127
02:13:30,760 --> 02:13:31,120
Sorry.

2128
02:13:31,580 --> 02:13:34,020
I didn't mean to fucking flirt with you.

2129
02:13:34,140 --> 02:13:35,380

2131
02:13:43,860 --> 02:13:44,740
Yeah, uncomplicated.

2132
02:13:47,060 --> 02:13:51,360
You know, instead of saying what you can say other than it's
complicated, I have a boyfriend.

2133
02:13:51,900 --> 02:13:53,380
You could have just said that.

2134
02:13:56,640 --> 02:14:00,160
Oh, yeah, I was going to say, bro, who are the people that
didn't, bro, because that's fucked.

2173
02:22:19,870 --> 02:22:22,830
It just feels like you could be a little gentler with it.

2174
02:22:23,030 --> 02:22:25,110
It is, you know, my whole fucking life.

2175
02:22:25,390 --> 02:22:27,310
Every time I walk in this place, I get sad.

2176
02:22:28,150 --> 02:22:29,370
That don't happen to you.

2177
02:22:30,110 --> 02:22:30,830
No one ever told you.

2178
02:22:30,910 --> 02:22:31,430
Bro, I'm poor.

2179
02:22:32,490 --> 02:22:33,530
Why do you think I take this job?

2180
02:22:34,370 --> 02:22:35,590
Does that make you feel good?

2181
02:22:35,610 --> 02:22:36,310
I don't have subscribers.

2182
02:22:36,970 --> 02:22:38,210
You're not poor if you can keep this suit going.

2183
02:22:38,650 --> 02:22:40,070
Like, where are you sleep?

2184
02:22:40,830 --> 02:22:41,670
In this chair?

2185
02:22:42,010 --> 02:22:42,930
Figuring that out.

2186
02:22:43,390 --> 02:22:44,690
You're figuring that out, huh?

2187
02:22:45,550 --> 02:22:47,250
So even the beef got a bed.

2188
02:22:48,450 --> 02:22:51,770
This is the type of apartment you see when the detective
kicked the door in.

2189
02:22:51,910 --> 02:22:54,770
You know, shine the flashlight, serial killer shit.

2190
02:22:55,210 --> 02:22:56,110
All right, I get it.

2191
02:22:56,250 --> 02:22:57,050
Can we focus on...

2192
02:22:57,050 --> 02:22:57,910
Where the Astral Pole's at?

2193
02:22:58,610 --> 02:23:00,170
Lost in the blast while I was flying.

2194
02:23:00,570 --> 02:23:01,530
No clue where it landed.

2195
02:23:01,670 --> 02:23:02,370
Bro, this is like...

2196
02:23:02,370 --> 02:23:04,870
I spent a couple weeks after it happened trying to track it
down.

2197
02:23:05,090 --> 02:23:06,490
Single male living space.

2198
02:23:06,810 --> 02:23:07,570
And that's me.

2199
02:23:07,750 --> 02:23:09,610
The only piece of the suit my dad didn't have schematics
for.

2200
02:23:10,010 --> 02:23:10,830
Is that gonna be a problem?

2201
02:23:12,690 --> 02:23:13,870
Ah, mine now.

2202
02:23:14,030 --> 02:23:14,470
We figure them out.

2203
02:23:14,490 --> 02:23:16,530
That's literally how I live, too.

2204
02:23:16,690 --> 02:23:17,590
How'd you know about that?

2205
02:23:18,230 --> 02:23:20,230
Oh, but everybody know about the pulse.

2206
02:23:20,790 --> 02:23:22,550
It's actually two wicked pieces of tech, huh?

2207
02:23:22,910 --> 02:23:26,110
Well, first you get the Astral Pulse, this genius design
energy cell.

2208
02:23:26,470 --> 02:23:28,230
But inside them, you get the stellar core.

2209
02:23:28,610 --> 02:23:29,090
Can I help?

2210
02:23:29,430 --> 02:23:29,850
No, brother.

2211
02:23:30,310 --> 02:23:30,830
You good.

2212
02:23:31,810 --> 02:23:36,270
What's crazy is when you mix the control fusion reactions
with the plasma containment.

2213
02:23:36,770 --> 02:23:37,170
Oh, brother.

2214
02:23:37,410 --> 02:23:40,090
You got a core one, super crazy, energized plasma state.

2215
02:23:40,690 --> 02:23:41,350
Unreal stuff.

2216
02:23:41,630 --> 02:23:43,810
Like you caught one small star and chop them in a bottle.

2217
02:23:44,570 --> 02:23:44,830
Genius.

2218
02:23:46,450 --> 02:23:47,030
Oh, good.

2219
02:23:48,350 --> 02:23:49,510
You said we're good.

2220
02:23:49,930 --> 02:23:52,430
Ashtapaw's super awesome, but we'll be all right.

2221
02:23:55,010 --> 02:23:55,050
Whew.

2222
02:23:55,890 --> 02:23:58,710
Man, maybe we go for a lot of medals this time, huh?

2223
02:24:01,710 --> 02:24:04,910
You know, I actually met your dad one time, long time ago.

2224
02:24:05,410 --> 02:24:08,870
First time I come mainland, he'll catch me trying for steal
stuff from Radio Shack.

2225
02:24:09,610 --> 02:24:11,370
Then we talk tech stuff for like an whole hour.

2226
02:24:12,290 --> 02:24:13,310
Then he would take me to jail.

2227
02:24:14,090 --> 02:24:15,690
That's how I ended up in the Phoenix program.

2228
02:24:16,050 --> 02:24:16,910
Wait, he was a villain?

2229
02:24:18,130 --> 02:24:29,370
had with him oh almost yes when you're building astropulses
there's not much time for talking oh yeah he has big daddy

2230
02:24:29,370 --> 02:24:35,190
issues not so sure about that i don't understand you see
there's gear heads then there's science nerds one kind

2231
02:24:35,190 --> 02:24:41,930
garage the other kind lab you know your father won't go gear
head but i just can't see how he'll make something like the

2232
02:24:41,930 --> 02:24:47,390
pulse he knows science nerd how would you know this from
talking to him maybe he used to work with shroud because i'm

2233
02:24:47,390 --> 02:24:51,430
both True, I'm the one going to fix your suit.

2234
02:24:53,550 --> 02:24:56,050
Oh my god, what if Shroud was the one that made him the
thing?

2235
02:25:01,040 --> 02:25:02,660
That one over there.

2236
02:25:03,180 --> 02:25:03,940
That's your father's suit.

2237
02:25:05,540 --> 02:25:07,860
We're going to make this one the robber's suit.

2238
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:09,840
The robber's suit.

2239
02:25:11,520 --> 02:25:13,600
This is incredible, Royd.

2240
02:25:21,050 --> 02:25:22,510
I hope you like the brother.

2241
02:25:23,550 --> 02:25:23,950
Royd.

2242
02:25:24,030 --> 02:25:25,110
I don't know what to say.

2243
02:25:25,770 --> 02:25:26,190
Thank you.

2244
02:25:27,090 --> 02:25:28,810
Thank you is what I need to say.

2245
02:25:29,150 --> 02:25:30,390
This is unreal.

2246
02:25:31,070 --> 02:25:32,790
We make the man Mika again.

2247
02:25:40,840 --> 02:25:41,580
Oh my god.

2248
02:25:41,720 --> 02:25:43,440
I'm going to have a job again.

2249
02:25:43,920 --> 02:25:46,100
Or like, I guess technically it wasn't my job.

2250
02:25:46,240 --> 02:25:46,860
I was doing it for free.

2251
02:25:49,800 --> 02:25:50,600
My phone.

2252
02:25:51,780 --> 02:25:53,200
Watch where you're going, bro.

2253
02:25:54,600 --> 02:25:54,880
Hey.

2254
02:25:55,280 --> 02:25:55,680
Yeah.

2255
02:25:56,100 --> 02:25:56,900
Watch where you're going.

2256
02:25:58,640 --> 02:26:00,080
I think you did that on purpose.

2257
02:26:01,980 --> 02:26:02,760
That's right.

2258
02:26:03,280 --> 02:26:04,580
I fend for myself.

2259
02:26:05,900 --> 02:26:08,300
I'm not gonna let him walk over me just because he's made a
play.

2260
02:26:10,360 --> 02:26:11,220
I'm his manager.

2261
02:26:12,760 --> 02:26:15,020
Look at Rude, he bumps into me!

2262
02:26:16,740 --> 02:26:18,400
Hey, Chase, I need a favor.

2263
02:26:19,220 --> 02:26:20,500

His name's Beef, and he's the favor.

02:26:30,100 --> 02:26:36,440
you mind keeping an eye out I feel bad leaving him at home
but I don't want anything happening to him Robert I would

that means I didn't which is what I was hoping for it is

2275
02:27:37,800 --> 02:27:45,140
what it is over sushi actually not what I wanted to talk to
you about I was thinking about it over the weekend and I'm

2276
02:27:45,140 --> 02:27:51,360
going to cut someone from the Z team you want to be rebound
a fucking course I do that's Dear?

2277
02:27:51,880 --> 02:27:53,300
Bro, she's a muscle mommy.

2278
02:27:53,880 --> 02:27:54,200
Urgency.

You sure about that?

2281
02:27:58,600 --> 02:28:00,340
Well, less sure now.

2282
02:28:00,720 --> 02:28:01,540
You think it's a bad idea?

2283
02:28:02,140 --> 02:28:04,400
I'm just not sure how it'll play out.

2284
02:28:05,420 --> 02:28:10,420
The reality is cutting someone towards the bottom of the
leaderboards will show everyone we're serious.

2285
02:28:11,520 --> 02:28:12,440
They're not at the bottom.

2286
02:28:12,640 --> 02:28:13,280
I'll let the team know.

2287
02:28:13,460 --> 02:28:14,440
Oh, I already did.

2288
02:28:14,820 --> 02:28:15,060
What?

2289
02:28:15,660 --> 02:28:17,920
I suppose it'll be an interesting shift.

2290
02:28:18,760 --> 02:28:20,100
Oh, they're all going to complete.

02:28:53,010 --> 02:28:53,650
What happened?

2295
02:28:53,910 --> 02:28:55,370
Coup seduced me.

2296
02:28:56,170 --> 02:28:56,610
No.

2297
02:28:57,350 --> 02:28:58,750
I said, hey, I want to say something cool.

2298
02:28:59,010 --> 02:28:59,450
And then...

2299
02:29:02,350 --> 02:29:03,830
So I assumed you meant boobs.

2300
02:29:05,650 --> 02:29:09,290
Someone's getting cut, but don't let that distract you from
doing a good job out there.

2301
02:29:09,570 --> 02:29:10,910
You graduated from Harvard, guys.

2302
02:29:11,290 --> 02:29:12,790
What a bunch of bullshit.

2303
02:29:13,130 --> 02:29:13,470
Sorry.

2304
02:29:13,750 --> 02:29:14,290
What's bullshit?

2305
02:29:14,490 --> 02:29:15,710
It could happen to anyone.

2306
02:29:16,070 --> 02:29:16,490
How is that?

2307
02:29:16,530 --> 02:29:17,710
Yeah, only God can judge me.

2308
02:29:18,210 --> 02:29:18,450
Okay.

2309
02:29:18,670 --> 02:29:19,590
Only God can...

2310
02:29:21,610 --> 02:29:23,670
No one can judge me, but God.

2311
02:29:24,730 --> 02:29:31,110
false of course i'm being judged along with the rest of you
are you do not know what a job is what the hell is going on

2312
02:29:31,110 --> 02:29:39,730
wait wait it's all right fine just ignore the pressure and
do your jobs you don't need to be first you just can't be

2313
02:29:39,730 --> 02:29:52,210
last uh what about me can somebody go down to the gym and
help bat boner who the guy who's shaped like a bat uh losing

2314
02:29:52,210 --> 02:29:55,550
feeling in my hand and then It was gonna help him.

2315
02:29:55,790 --> 02:29:56,190
Kinky way.

2316
02:29:59,290 --> 02:30:02,870
There was an altercation with my team and a monster down at
the beach.

2317
02:30:03,010 --> 02:30:04,990
And there's some debris of...

2318
02:30:04,990 --> 02:30:06,110
Little giant monster.

Large media and civvy.

02:31:29,520 --> 02:31:30,560
I did unspeakable things in that alley.

2339
02:31:31,800 --> 02:31:32,360
Uh-huh.

2340
02:31:32,580 --> 02:31:35,520
You know, this is really fucking immature guys.

2341
02:31:35,680 --> 02:31:36,440
Serves them right.

2342
02:31:36,880 --> 02:31:37,840
You let your guard down.

2343
02:31:38,220 --> 02:31:38,460
You perish.

2344
02:31:38,460 --> 02:31:39,020
What is this?

2345
02:31:39,140 --> 02:31:39,640
What is F?

2346
02:31:39,840 --> 02:31:41,380
That's a pretty fucked way to live.

2347
02:31:41,880 --> 02:31:43,020
Emphasis on live.

2348
02:31:43,540 --> 02:31:44,740
Oh, my God.

2349
02:31:45,200 --> 02:31:50,020
You do realize that sabotaging each other isn't going to
guarantee you a spot on the team, right?

2350
02:31:51,020 --> 02:31:51,820
Oh, no.

2351
02:31:51,960 --> 02:31:52,540
Oh, no.

2352
02:31:52,580 --> 02:31:53,120
No.

2353
02:31:53,720 --> 02:31:54,660
Oh, no.

2354
02:31:55,140 --> 02:31:56,100
Oh, no.

2355
02:31:56,980 --> 02:31:58,320
Oh, and he gets...

2356
02:31:58,320 --> 02:31:59,340
Okay, there's stats.

2357
02:31:59,540 --> 02:32:00,980
If it gets hurt, they'll become...

2358
02:32:00,980 --> 02:32:02,440
Okay, that's not good.

2359
02:32:02,880 --> 02:32:04,400
Okay, this is...

2360
02:32:04,400 --> 02:32:05,160
Oh, gosh.

2361
02:32:05,180 --> 02:32:07,640
There's a drug deal happening at the Torn's airport right
now.

2362
02:32:08,040 --> 02:32:10,260
I think you should send the bat guy.

2363
02:32:11,900 --> 02:32:12,580
Convincingly...

2364
02:32:12,580 --> 02:32:14,420
Pose as a buyer.

2365
02:32:14,940 --> 02:32:18,800
Preferably someone highly educated on drugs.

2366
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:20,300
Oh, that's Prism.

2367
02:32:24,140 --> 02:32:26,220
That's Prism, isn't it?

2368
02:32:30,820 --> 02:32:32,100
Yeah, that's...

2369
02:32:32,100 --> 02:32:33,700
Sona knows jobs.

2370
02:32:33,980 --> 02:32:34,860
I'm going!

2371
02:32:35,720 --> 02:32:38,680
Let's send the Prism and send the...

2372
02:32:38,680 --> 02:32:39,560
Oh, it's done.

2373
02:32:40,620 --> 02:32:41,560
Oh, man.

2374
02:32:42,220 --> 02:32:42,460
Why?

2375
02:32:42,460 --> 02:32:42,960
Bye-bye.

2376
02:32:44,140 --> 02:32:45,740
I feel like...

2377
02:32:45,740 --> 02:32:47,020
We'll send both of them.

2378
02:32:47,100 --> 02:32:47,300
You know what?

2379
02:32:47,380 --> 02:32:48,420
I'll send both of them in.

2380
02:32:50,080 --> 02:32:52,820
Sona and Sona who is recovering.

2381
02:32:52,960 --> 02:32:53,240
Yeah.

2382
02:32:54,560 --> 02:32:55,820
Here we go.

2383
02:32:56,560 --> 02:32:58,760
Maybe Prism can help him out.

2384
02:32:58,760 --> 02:32:59,540
Drug bust.

2385
02:33:00,320 --> 02:33:00,700
Fuck yeah.

2386
02:33:00,980 --> 02:33:02,320
My two favorite things.

2387
02:33:02,740 --> 02:33:03,840
Drugs and booze.

2388
02:33:06,040 --> 02:33:07,960
Soner Docs who is now being...

2389

What?

2391
02:33:09,860 --> 02:33:11,540
Surprise drops are good for a brand.

2392
02:33:12,160 --> 02:33:13,420
Distract them with a sign.

2393
02:33:19,570 --> 02:33:20,110
There we go.

2394
02:33:20,390 --> 02:33:21,310
You got this.

2395
02:33:22,310 --> 02:33:22,930
Playing the hits?

2396

They work together.

2465
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,720

I mean maybe?

2475
02:37:48,020 --> 02:37:49,120

You got someone that can figure out how to stop a landslide?

2477
02:37:54,740 --> 02:37:55,240
Stand aside.

2478
02:37:55,620 --> 02:37:57,580
As hot and threatening as that sounds.

2479
02:37:58,080 --> 02:37:59,060
I'm not going anywhere.

2480
02:37:59,700 --> 02:38:00,760
We're tied for the bottom.

2481
02:38:01,500 --> 02:38:03,040
With fucking Invisigal.

2482
02:38:03,440 --> 02:38:04,040

I'm fine with that.

2498
02:38:26,180 --> 02:38:26,720
It's okay.

2499
02:38:28,200 --> 02:38:28,660
Surely.

2500
02:38:29,240 --> 02:38:30,260
It'll be okay.

2501
02:38:33,220 --> 02:38:34,460
Oh, my God.

You have signed your death warrant.

2505
02:38:42,440 --> 02:38:42,780

refused to let me leave.

2511
02:38:56,200 --> 02:38:58,360
I hate the water and old people.

2512
02:38:58,820 --> 02:39:00,340
Do I just backstroke away?

2513
02:39:01,800 --> 02:39:04,560
Or do I describe backstroke away?

2514
02:39:05,380 --> 02:39:06,720

02:49:53,380 --> 02:49:57,340
c what matters is i'm here to figure out who stays and who

2688
02:50:01,420 --> 02:50:01,900
Damn.

2689
02:50:02,920 --> 02:50:04,020
You hipster motherfucker?

2690
02:50:04,640 --> 02:50:06,900
Over here looking like Mumford fucked all his sons.

2691
02:50:06,920 --> 02:50:08,100
That's not a bad leader.

2692
02:50:08,120 --> 02:50:08,640
That was funny.

2693
02:50:08,920 --> 02:50:09,100
See?

2694
02:50:09,520 --> 02:50:10,340
We're just forcing balls.

2695
02:50:10,580 --> 02:50:11,240
Keep talking.

2696
02:50:11,860 --> 02:50:14,540
You won't have your tiny inbred balls left to bust.

2697
02:50:15,600 --> 02:50:16,500
Ask next time.

2698
02:50:16,760 --> 02:50:18,160
Or there won't be a next time.

2699
02:50:18,160 --> 02:50:19,780
Don't threaten me, you butterknife bitch.

2700
02:50:20,120 --> 02:50:21,180
Oh, shit.

2701
02:50:22,280 --> 02:50:23,860
No, they're just bad people.

2702
02:50:24,120 --> 02:50:25,280
Most people will look around.

2703
02:50:25,520 --> 02:50:26,200
They're not fixable.

2704
02:50:26,380 --> 02:50:26,760
That's why.

2705
02:50:27,340 --> 02:50:28,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2706
02:50:28,260 --> 02:50:29,080
They're just not fixable.

2707
02:50:30,260 --> 02:50:31,260
It's not my fault.

2708
02:50:31,460 --> 02:50:34,260
Run in the mill, vanilla fucking villains.

2709
02:50:35,220 --> 02:50:36,260
But that's not what I see.

2710
02:50:37,140 --> 02:50:39,440
Because lucky for you, I'm not most people.

2711
02:50:40,740 --> 02:50:44,460
When I look around this room, what I see is...

2712
02:50:45,220 --> 02:50:45,720
Potential.

2713
02:50:46,060 --> 02:50:46,520
Potential.

2714
02:50:47,060 --> 02:50:47,900
Both are in the end.

2715
02:50:48,380 --> 02:50:50,060
Unfortunately for you, it's a curse.

2716
02:50:50,660 --> 02:50:54,660
Because there isn't a thing in the universe that goes more
wasted than potential.

2717
02:50:55,240 --> 02:50:58,360
And despite how common it is, no one seems to forget.

2718
02:50:58,360 --> 02:51:00,820
It's what they whisper when you leave the room.

2719
02:51:01,280 --> 02:51:03,860
Oh, so-and-so had so much potential.

2720
02:51:04,300 --> 02:51:05,460
It follows you forever.

2721
02:51:07,200 --> 02:51:13,700
I'm here to help you lift the curse of potential by getting
you to fucking do something with it.

2722
02:51:14,660 --> 02:51:15,640
Potential man.

2723
02:51:15,960 --> 02:51:17,700
You're all part of the Phoenix program.

2724
02:51:18,280 --> 02:51:20,260
Any of you know what a Phoenix is?

2725
02:51:20,400 --> 02:51:21,700
Oh, a city in Arizona.

2726
02:51:21,840 --> 02:51:23,320
Yeah, the sweltering ball sack of America.

2727
02:51:24,480 --> 02:51:26,400
Then Louisiana's got to be the ball sack.

2728
02:51:26,940 --> 02:51:27,900
Just, you know, position.

2729
02:51:28,360 --> 02:51:28,800
Phoenix.

2730
02:51:29,440 --> 02:51:29,500
Sorry.

2731
02:51:30,300 --> 02:51:30,500
Attention, man.

2732
02:51:30,780 --> 02:51:34,340
This is a beautiful bird of prey that was so tired of its
immortality.

2733
02:51:34,480 --> 02:51:38,760
It tricked the sun god into dropping a spark on its nest to
set it ablaze.

2734
02:51:39,540 --> 02:51:40,320
Burning it to shit.

2735
02:51:42,760 --> 02:51:46,760
But instead of dying, the Phoenix emerged from ash.

2736
02:51:47,120 --> 02:51:50,980
Look, I give them tough love and then like glaze them up.

2737
02:51:51,220 --> 02:51:53,920
All of you in this room are Phoenixes and it's obvious what
that means.

2738
02:51:54,500 --> 02:51:56,920
But for you dumb ones, I'll spell it out.

2739
02:51:58,360 --> 02:52:06,940
good cop i'm both redemption is what you're here for is what
connects everyone in this room to burn up who you were to

2746
02:53:08,200 --> 02:53:08,560
Huh?

2747
02:53:10,800 --> 02:53:11,680
What is this?

2748
02:53:11,760 --> 02:53:12,940
Take a hero out of resting.

2749
02:53:13,120 --> 02:53:14,880
Okay, I just filled him up with coffee.

2750
02:53:16,560 --> 02:53:18,740
Check the info for tags.

2751
02:53:19,380 --> 02:53:19,960
What tags?

2752
02:53:20,120 --> 02:53:21,560
Oh, Defender Versatile.

2753
02:53:22,340 --> 02:53:22,680
Okay.

2754
02:53:28,010 --> 02:53:29,450
Alright, this is fine.

2755
02:53:31,390 --> 02:53:32,310
Nah, he's cool.

2756
02:53:32,730 --> 02:53:33,890
Look, he's not cool.

2757
02:53:34,310 --> 02:53:37,790
My client requires protection while he does some shopping.

2758
02:53:38,290 --> 02:53:39,370
I remember this man.

2759
02:53:39,810 --> 02:53:40,870
And he's right to be paranoid.

2760
02:53:41,670 --> 02:53:43,430
Secret police hired me three years ago to kill him.

2761
02:53:44,030 --> 02:53:45,050
He pissed off the wrong dictator.

2762
02:53:45,450 --> 02:53:49,210
Protect the subscriber from ancient while he shops.

2763
02:53:50,010 --> 02:53:50,770
He can protect.

2764
02:53:51,110 --> 02:53:51,310
What?

2765
02:53:52,930 --> 02:53:53,470
Golem.

2766
02:53:55,170 --> 02:53:55,730
Golem.

2767
02:53:57,590 --> 02:53:58,950
There you go, Golem.

2768
02:54:00,030 --> 02:54:01,150
Protect the...

2769
02:54:01,150 --> 02:54:03,170
I feel like I need...

2770
02:54:03,170 --> 02:54:04,010
Bigger, right?

2771
02:54:04,350 --> 02:54:05,290
I was...

2772
02:54:08,290 --> 02:54:09,930
See, I put him back in.

2773
02:54:11,850 --> 02:54:13,530
Prepare to fend off any incoming attack.

2774
02:54:13,690 --> 02:54:16,590
I feel like I should be prepared.

2775
02:54:16,990 --> 02:54:18,550
Yeah, I feel like...

2776
02:54:18,550 --> 02:54:19,050
Fine.

2777
02:54:19,590 --> 02:54:20,010
There we go.

2778
02:54:20,850 --> 02:54:21,870
Yeah, he should be fine.

2779
02:54:22,190 --> 02:54:23,010
No, he's fine.

2780
02:54:23,930 --> 02:54:24,750
He can't be Ingy.

2781
02:54:25,090 --> 02:54:25,910
Or a mudslide.

2782
02:54:26,230 --> 02:54:26,910
He's fine.

2783
02:54:29,350 --> 02:54:31,610
He's gotta force him to work.

2784
02:54:34,530 --> 02:54:36,710
Yeah, and he has defense.

2785
02:54:37,750 --> 02:54:38,270
Okay.

2786
02:54:38,290 --> 02:54:41,610
Some bitch just cut me in line at the Utopia concert.

2787
02:54:42,010 --> 02:54:44,410
I've been here for 12 fucking hours.

2788
02:54:45,090 --> 02:54:46,090
Utopia is a hack.

2789
02:54:46,430 --> 02:54:47,230
I like her.

2790
02:54:47,870 --> 02:54:49,890
You basic bat.

2791
02:54:51,030 --> 02:54:57,270
You've got super hearing and you use it to listen to a girl
who knows four chords and can't write a song to save her

2792
02:54:57,270 --> 02:54:57,670
life.

2793
02:54:58,050 --> 02:54:58,710
Say what you want.

2794
02:54:59,230 --> 02:54:59,810
It's catchy.

2795
02:55:00,330 --> 02:55:00,470
Unbelievable.

2796
02:55:01,750 --> 02:55:02,790
I feel like I need someone.

2797
02:55:03,210 --> 02:55:04,030
What, charisma?

2798
02:55:06,070 --> 02:55:06,590
Sonar?

2799
02:55:08,290 --> 02:55:09,050
I guess I could.

2800
02:55:09,350 --> 02:55:09,350
Yeah.

2801
02:55:10,210 --> 02:55:10,210
Intelligence.

2802
02:55:10,550 --> 02:55:11,210
Yeah, let's do it.

2803
02:55:12,090 --> 02:55:13,430
Guess what I found out last night?

2804
02:55:14,210 --> 02:55:15,350
The SDN office.

2805
02:55:15,570 --> 02:55:16,410
All right, did you do okay?

2806
02:55:16,750 --> 02:55:18,110
The Cold War CIA prison.

2807
02:55:18,850 --> 02:55:19,650
And torrents.

2808
02:55:19,750 --> 02:55:20,450
Okay, 73.

2809
02:55:20,710 --> 02:55:21,130
I know, isn't that sick?

2810
02:55:21,370 --> 02:55:22,650
The odds are in my favor.

2811
02:55:24,430 --> 02:55:25,430
There you go, Golem.

2812
02:55:26,490 --> 02:55:26,930
Look at that.

2813
02:55:27,090 --> 02:55:28,870
Now you, maybe you won't get cut now.

2814
02:55:30,250 --> 02:55:31,210
I'll put that in.

2815
02:55:32,610 --> 02:55:34,810
Why is there like, there's an extra somewhere.

2816
02:55:35,190 --> 02:55:35,930
I don't know where.

2817
02:55:37,430 --> 02:55:38,170
See that, right?

2818
02:55:39,950 --> 02:55:49,450

2822
02:56:11,050 --> 02:56:11,750
Do we have enough?

2823
02:56:11,970 --> 02:56:13,150
That's charisma, right?

2824
02:56:13,850 --> 02:56:14,870
Yeah, that's charisma.

2825
02:56:15,090 --> 02:56:15,990
Fuck, I knew it.

2826
02:56:16,350 --> 02:56:16,970
I was thinking.

2827
02:56:20,470 --> 02:56:21,090
Oh, thank God.

2828
02:56:21,170 --> 02:56:21,990
Yeah, we have a lot.

2829
02:56:23,450 --> 02:56:24,390
I was thinking that was charisma.

2830
02:56:27,170 --> 02:56:28,630
All right, we have an upgrade, too.

2831
02:56:30,670 --> 02:56:31,670
You know what?

2832
02:56:31,910 --> 02:56:34,470
We'll put you some combat as well.

2833
02:56:35,350 --> 02:56:36,090
Won't be bad.

2834
02:56:36,270 --> 02:56:37,850
Can't be too bad to be able to fight.

2835
02:56:40,270 --> 02:56:42,910
There's some kind of cult recruiting outside my store.

2836
02:56:43,090 --> 02:56:44,210
They're creeping everyone up.

2837
02:56:45,070 --> 02:56:46,950
Tell them to disperse immediately.

2838
02:56:48,430 --> 02:56:49,930
Who's smart enough for that?

2839
02:56:52,370 --> 02:56:54,110
I feel like that's...

2840
02:56:54,110 --> 02:56:54,970
On it.

2841
02:56:55,850 --> 02:56:56,750
Charisma, right?

2842
02:56:57,270 --> 02:56:57,450
Wait.

2843
02:56:59,290 --> 02:57:00,250
That's charisma.

2844
02:57:01,290 --> 02:57:03,050
And what to identify them.

2845
02:57:03,210 --> 02:57:05,330
So by identifying, we use our brain.

2846
02:57:05,650 --> 02:57:05,950
Yeah?

2847
02:57:07,610 --> 02:57:08,270
So...

2848
02:57:08,290 --> 02:57:09,950
Well, that's more brain.

2849
02:57:12,750 --> 02:57:13,690
Are you kidding?

2850
02:57:14,670 --> 02:57:14,910
What?

2851
02:57:14,950 --> 02:57:15,610
You don't like her?

2852
02:57:15,930 --> 02:57:16,510
Since when?

2853
02:57:17,230 --> 02:57:18,290
I'm gonna make you like her.

2854
02:57:18,470 --> 02:57:20,110
I think there's also some kind of cult recruiting outside my
store.

2855
02:57:20,190 --> 02:57:20,950
They're creeping everyone out.

2856
02:57:20,970 --> 02:57:22,150
Why don't you like her?

2857
02:57:23,270 --> 02:57:24,690
Don't mess with perfection.

2858
02:57:24,830 --> 02:57:25,550
Alright, that's fine.

2859
02:57:26,330 --> 02:57:27,170
That's fine.

2860
02:57:28,790 --> 02:57:29,890
We don't need it.

2861
02:57:37,040 --> 02:57:37,480
Melvonia.

2862
02:57:39,640 --> 02:57:40,560
Free their minds.

2863
02:57:40,800 --> 02:57:41,880
I feel like that's intelligence.

2864
02:57:42,060 --> 02:57:42,900
Destroy their lives.

2865

2871
02:58:27,080 --> 02:58:29,220
For some kind of fight club.

2872
02:58:29,580 --> 02:58:31,800
Shut down the underground fight club.

2873
02:58:32,260 --> 02:58:33,380

We can get two.

2881
02:58:45,640 --> 02:58:46,520
We don't need three.

2882
02:58:50,010 --> 02:58:50,810
Whatever you say, boss.

2883
02:58:50,810 --> 02:58:51,770
Fight in that fight club.

2884
02:58:51,850 --> 02:59:02,430

2891
02:59:30,110 --> 02:59:30,510

2893
02:59:36,560 --> 02:59:37,700
Hey, what's up, little lady?

2896
02:59:39,840 --> 02:59:40,960
Oh, that's why.

2897
02:59:46,200 --> 02:59:48,200
I don't think he's gonna make it.

2898
02:59:51,940 --> 02:59:54,160
Oh, yeah, no, 100%.

2899

02:59:56,420 --> 02:59:57,100
I'm on it.

2901
02:59:58,680 --> 03:00:00,120
We won the fight club.

2902
03:00:00,720 --> 03:00:01,480
We did it guys.

2903
03:00:01,660 --> 03:00:05,220
We won All right, that's a hundred.

2904
03:00:06,240 --> 03:00:06,680
Let's go.

2905
03:00:07,400 --> 03:00:08,640
How'd you manage this one?

2906
03:00:08,760 --> 03:00:10,900
I don't want to talk about it.

2907
03:00:11,020 --> 03:00:11,880
I've learned from my sources.

2908
03:00:12,000 --> 03:00:12,500
Where's she going?

2909
03:00:12,860 --> 03:00:17,360

2910
03:00:17,640 --> 03:00:18,120
Bro, fight in it.

2911
03:00:18,260 --> 03:00:19,700
Robert, send me in to compete.

2912
03:00:20,300 --> 03:00:21,580
I'll win so hard.

2913
03:00:22,100 --> 03:00:23,860
We'll bankrupt every bookie in Torrance.

2914
03:00:23,880 --> 03:00:24,580
Bro, let's do it.

2915
03:00:24,860 --> 03:00:25,540

2916
03:00:25,940 --> 03:00:26,220
Don't worry.

2917
03:00:26,300 --> 03:00:26,800

03:00:29,900 --> 03:00:30,340
Wait, what?

Legally.

2924
03:00:34,520 --> 03:00:36,600
Your flight-capable heroes need a flight license.

2925
03:00:37,080 --> 03:00:37,780
That's fine.

2926
03:00:38,300 --> 03:00:39,280
Go to a fly school.

2927
03:00:42,220 --> 03:00:43,800
No, we don't need to use coffee yet.

2928

03:00:49,460 --> 03:00:51,420
Bro, he is bored to fight.

2933
03:00:51,660 --> 03:00:52,440
You can't get hurt.

2934
03:00:52,820 --> 03:00:54,040
And we can win money, too!

2935
03:00:54,400 --> 03:00:55,780

Participate in a friendly debate.

03:01:50,960 --> 03:01:51,640
I know who to do.

2952
03:01:51,640 --> 03:01:52,340
It's on my radar.

2953
03:01:53,460 --> 03:01:53,540
Yeah.

2954
03:01:53,560 --> 03:01:54,060
Fuck it.

2955
03:01:54,680 --> 03:01:55,380
These two like each other.

2956
03:01:55,440 --> 03:01:55,760
Oh, my God.

2957
03:01:55,900 --> 03:01:56,040
These two.

2958
03:01:56,040 --> 03:01:56,560
I always forget.

2959
03:01:56,700 --> 03:01:58,100
I've got better things to do anyway.

2960
03:01:59,040 --> 03:01:59,920
Wanna dance?

2961
03:02:01,360 --> 03:02:02,860
They're okay with each other, right?

2962
03:02:04,760 --> 03:02:05,960
I think they are.

2963
03:02:06,900 --> 03:02:08,060
Oh, Sonar and Mel?

2964
03:02:08,880 --> 03:02:09,820
Oh, that's fine.

2965
03:02:10,060 --> 03:02:10,840
There you go.

2966
03:02:12,420 --> 03:02:14,360
I keep forgetting who they're friends with.

2967
03:02:17,660 --> 03:02:17,960
Oh?

2968
03:02:20,060 --> 03:02:20,500
Sorry.

2969
03:02:23,680 --> 03:02:24,280
Don't worry.

2970
03:02:24,360 --> 03:02:24,900

Oh, the sabotage is over?

2974
03:02:32,280 --> 03:02:33,240
Does it happen again?

2975
03:02:33,280 --> 03:02:35,520
Do they ever sabotage again?

2976
03:02:35,600 --> 03:02:37,600
Put your position at the top of the leaderboard.

2977
03:02:38,400 --> 03:02:39,260
Don't be jealous.

2978
03:02:39,700 --> 03:02:41,180
I took a little peek at your file.

2979
03:02:41,700 --> 03:02:44,340
Apparently you've got more fire than anyone else on the
team.

2980
03:02:44,660 --> 03:02:45,680
I'm like a psychic, man.

2981
03:02:46,400 --> 03:02:48,660
I can sense where they're going to be before they happen.

2982
03:02:49,240 --> 03:02:52,980
Listen, listen, there's a lot of potential here for a good
health insurance scheme.

Yeah, let's give him word.

3064
03:09:22,810 --> 03:09:23,830
Invisigaw, where are you going?

3065
03:09:24,030 --> 03:09:24,770
It's not my fault.

3066
03:09:31,280 --> 03:09:32,100
What's going on?

3067
03:09:32,340 --> 03:09:33,200
Is she depressed?

3068
03:09:33,380 --> 03:09:34,880
Because I'm going to keep fire her?

3069
03:09:39,010 --> 03:09:40,390
Smoking in a playground.

3070
03:09:40,990 --> 03:09:41,930
The fuck's wrong with you?

3071
03:09:42,130 --> 03:09:42,670
There you go.

3072
03:09:42,930 --> 03:09:44,210
One more strike against me.

3073
03:09:44,670 --> 03:09:45,890
You gotta get rid of somebody, right?

3074
03:09:46,250 --> 03:09:47,070
I'm making it easy.

3075
03:09:47,090 --> 03:09:57,130
for you no you're quitting you're not making it easy for me
yeah why is she smoking of asthma you don't get it some

3076
03:09:57,130 --> 03:10:08,990
people are born to be heroes I'm not one of them I tried
just wasn't meant to be meant to be even try that hard oh

3077
03:10:08,990 --> 03:10:16,990
you didn't even try that hard flying through the sky nothing
to hide what's your point that was a freaky conversation I

3078
03:10:17,090 --> 03:10:24,870
Fucking villain powers I can turn invisible and skulk in the
shadows Yeah, but you can give in to and watch famous people

3079
03:10:24,870 --> 03:10:28,310
fuck and villain is my fate I watch you can just film it.

3080
03:10:28,310 --> 03:10:29,330
It's in the fucking stars.

3081
03:10:29,450 --> 03:10:37,250
And then sell it in the same way that blonde blazer was
always meant to be a hero It is bullshit It's bullshit.

3082
03:10:37,850 --> 03:10:41,990
This is something we cling to because we think we're the
main character of life.

3083
03:10:42,130 --> 03:10:49,670
Oh, I shouldn't have said that We're a bunch of flesh blobs
with depression on a floating rock Is that supposed to be

3084
03:10:49,670 --> 03:10:50,310
comforting?

3085
03:10:50,750 --> 03:10:54,650
Yeah, because no one's paying attention if you want to
switch things up.

3086
03:10:56,470 --> 03:10:57,930
You've already been a hero, okay?

3087
03:10:58,310 --> 03:10:59,950
You have no idea what I'm dealing with.

3088
03:11:00,230 --> 03:11:01,130
Oh, get out of here.

3089
03:11:01,490 --> 03:11:02,890
At least you were born with powers.

3090
03:11:03,110 --> 03:11:03,890
I don't have shit.

3091
03:11:04,290 --> 03:11:07,330
So according to your dumbass theory, I should be an
accountant.

3092
03:11:09,890 --> 03:11:10,870
You aren't far off.

3093
03:11:11,050 --> 03:11:12,850
Fate, destiny, not having powers.

3094
03:11:13,110 --> 03:11:14,190
She's into it, guys.

3095
03:11:14,270 --> 03:11:15,450
Me talking down on her.

3096
03:11:15,590 --> 03:11:16,510
I'm being a hero before.

3097
03:11:17,090 --> 03:11:22,370
and they won't keep me from what's that weird where you
compliments you insult them and then compliment them being a

3098

3100
03:11:39,430 --> 03:11:46,490
out you really want to let you get one over on you a third
time what makes you think it would be any different you're

the address shut the fuck up okay Sorry, I know it's like my

3105
03:12:25,090 --> 03:12:31,910
immersion, but that reminded me I was like walking down the
street one time And I think it was I think it was

3106
03:12:31,910 --> 03:12:39,690
Valentine's Day, I think and I was walking down the street
to buy some Buy some stuff for dad and I think I forgot to

3107
03:12:39,690 --> 03:12:47,710
tell you guys the story But this kid like walked up to me
and was like can you buy me alcohol for like my girlfriend

3108
03:12:47,710 --> 03:12:57,230
and I for that Like he was holding like a he was holding
like I didn't give a child holding like a like like a bunch

3109
03:12:57,230 --> 03:13:03,830
of flowers like bouquet of flowers and this kid went up to
me and was like can you buy us buy me alcohol for me and my

3110
03:13:03,830 --> 03:13:05,890
girlfriend for valentine's day

3111
03:13:11,140 --> 03:13:19,740
i don't know how old he was i was like i'll pay you i'll pay
you back but like like i'll give you like i'll give you like

3112
03:13:19,740 --> 03:13:23,980
double the money you can buy me for he

3113
03:13:29,670 --> 03:13:39,130
said no but that's what it reminded me of like I said no I
didn't want to get arrested like bro we were like it was day

3114
03:13:39,130 --> 03:13:49,270
it was day outside like I'm probably not gonna fight this
kid I don't know how old he is like I if I said yes I would

3115
03:13:49,270 --> 03:13:57,110
have not told this story on stream because that's me
admitting to a crime live on stream like

3116
03:14:00,710 --> 03:14:03,710
Of course I didn't fucking do it.

3117
03:14:03,830 --> 03:14:06,730
Why the fuck would I admit it on stream if I did?

3118
03:14:07,110 --> 03:14:10,370
But that's just what that's what they provided me of.

3119
03:14:21,490 --> 03:14:22,530
I don't know how old he is.

3120
03:14:22,590 --> 03:14:24,810
Like, he was like, I know he was underage.

3121
03:14:25,010 --> 03:14:26,730
Not underage, but you have to be.

3122
03:14:26,910 --> 03:14:27,230
Yeah, yeah.

3123
03:14:27,430 --> 03:14:28,870
Because in Canada, it's 18.

3124
03:14:30,570 --> 03:14:31,910
So he was definitely underage.

3125
03:14:31,930 --> 03:14:32,310
rage.

3126
03:14:32,790 --> 03:14:35,150
So if he's asking me to buy him alcohol.

3127
03:14:36,270 --> 03:14:37,970
Chad will remember that.

3128
03:14:37,990 --> 03:14:38,750
Where's your boy?

3129
03:14:40,190 --> 03:14:40,590
Shit.

3130
03:14:41,670 --> 03:14:44,270
Because like in America, it's 21, but Canada's 18.

3131
03:14:44,930 --> 03:14:46,730
So I was like, that's worse, you know?

3132
03:14:49,410 --> 03:14:51,710
You donut girl.

3133
03:14:52,330 --> 03:14:54,410
You sure you want to do this again?

3134
03:14:57,650 --> 03:14:58,850
He wasn't even going to pay you.

3135
03:14:58,910 --> 03:15:00,350
No, he was going to give me money first.

3136
03:15:00,430 --> 03:15:01,910
I mean, I could have just taken the money and just...

03:21:06,290 --> 03:21:08,350
I need to know in case I accidentally fuck it up.

3194
03:21:09,330 --> 03:21:16,390
whoever i'm picking is whoever i'm keeping but we all know
who we're keeping because 2025 is his year guys 20.

3195
03:21:19,490 --> 03:21:28,930
if i'm honest she still feels a little evil yeah it's too
bad all right i'll get started on the paperwork 2025 is his

3196
03:21:28,930 --> 03:21:37,310
year guys feels important hey uh robert gotta end the cycle
great work

3197
03:21:48,120 --> 03:21:51,220
Hoop, I'm sure you already know why I've asked you here.

3198
03:21:51,720 --> 03:21:52,540
You would be mistaken.

3199
03:21:53,100 --> 03:21:54,040
Oh, okay.

3200
03:21:54,540 --> 03:21:57,720
Um, well, I'm letting you go.

3201
03:21:58,360 --> 03:22:04,600
You're at the bottom of the leaderboards, I guess all those
penalties for, you know, cutting people, added up.

3202
03:22:05,120 --> 03:22:05,500
I'm sorry.

3203
03:22:05,840 --> 03:22:08,260
But I cheered for Invisagal.

3204
03:22:08,680 --> 03:22:09,120
You did.

3205
03:22:09,180 --> 03:22:09,680
I saw that.

3206
03:22:09,700 --> 03:22:10,460
We all cheered.

3207
03:22:10,700 --> 03:22:12,980
I only did that because I thought she was being cut.

3208
03:22:13,200 --> 03:22:13,500
Whoa.

3209
03:22:13,700 --> 03:22:14,900
That makes sense.

3210
03:22:15,180 --> 03:22:16,380
A lot of sense, actually.

3211
03:22:17,000 --> 03:22:20,420
Yeah, well, She snuck past her with her last dispatch.

3212
03:22:21,040 --> 03:22:21,560
Oh.

3213
03:22:23,440 --> 03:22:24,660
That's, uh...

3214
03:22:24,660 --> 03:22:25,400
Oh, look at that.

3215
03:22:25,640 --> 03:22:26,760
That's very menacing.

3216
03:22:27,380 --> 03:22:28,600
Well, thank you.

3217
03:22:29,640 --> 03:22:30,300
Oh, shit.

3218
03:22:35,540 --> 03:22:35,940
It's okay.

3219
03:22:36,060 --> 03:22:38,720
Maybe there are other superhero agencies out there.

3220
03:22:40,680 --> 03:22:41,260
You know?

3221
03:22:42,400 --> 03:22:45,380
Maybe there's other agencies that she can sign up for.

3222
03:22:46,040 --> 03:22:47,500
It can't be only one.

3223
03:22:48,060 --> 03:22:48,420
Right?

3224
03:22:49,420 --> 03:22:49,940
Right?

3225
03:22:50,800 --> 03:22:52,780
I just keep that.

3226
03:22:53,920 --> 03:22:54,880
You accessorizing?

3227
03:22:55,660 --> 03:22:56,520
You could call it that.

3228
03:22:57,300 --> 03:22:58,280
Where'd you get that?

3229
03:22:59,080 --> 03:22:59,400
Coop.

3230
03:23:00,120 --> 03:23:04,720
It's not bad to fire a heart ex-accessant, right?

3231
03:23:07,040 --> 03:23:08,120
One is just the bat.

3232
03:23:08,220 --> 03:23:10,920
The other one was an ex-accessant.

3233
03:23:11,100 --> 03:23:13,240
So I don't know if I made the right choice, guys.

3234
03:23:13,680 --> 03:23:15,160
You're spoiling him.

3235
03:23:15,180 --> 03:23:16,800
Now, sir, talk about it.

3236
03:23:16,860 --> 03:23:17,900
You ready to go home, bud?

3237
03:23:17,900 --> 03:23:18,160
Oh,

3238
03:23:21,920 --> 03:23:24,400
nothing bad will come out of this, I'm pretty sure.

3239
03:23:29,240 --> 03:23:30,840
Who's the bottom now?

3240
03:23:31,200 --> 03:23:31,520
Ah.

3241
03:23:33,920 --> 03:23:35,040
She's like, yeah.

3242
03:23:37,880 --> 03:23:39,460
Where is she on the...

3243
03:23:39,460 --> 03:23:40,700
Oh, she's third last.

3244
03:23:41,300 --> 03:23:43,720
Guys, as not, like, we're taking a picture of.

3245
03:23:44,580 --> 03:23:45,540
I'm third.

3246
03:23:45,760 --> 03:23:47,420
Guys, I'm third last.

3247
03:23:47,520 --> 03:23:48,120
Let's go.

3248
03:23:49,540 --> 03:23:50,080
Okay.

3249
03:23:50,900 --> 03:24:03,040

3251
03:24:16,160 --> 03:24:20,140
like everyone's like oh and i'm like why the is she taking a
picture

3252
03:24:26,470 --> 03:24:31,650
Okay, her being last is sort of, like, her fault, though,
because she was self-sabotaging herself, so...

3253
03:24:32,750 --> 03:24:35,170
You in 64, yeah, no one cuts Charlie.

3254
03:24:37,590 --> 03:24:38,150
Oh, this.

3255
03:24:39,070 --> 03:24:42,210
You in 23% of players kick Golem.

3256
03:24:42,870 --> 03:24:44,110
Why did you guys...

3257
03:24:44,110 --> 03:24:45,390
Oh, you guys are too soft.

3258
03:24:45,510 --> 03:24:46,930
You are all too soft, man.

3259
03:24:47,030 --> 03:24:48,690
We're teaching him a fucking lesson.

3260
03:24:48,830 --> 03:24:49,710
You're all too soft.

3261
03:24:51,330 --> 03:24:52,330
Okay, it helped.

3262
03:24:52,530 --> 03:24:54,710
Who the fuck did not help me?

3263
03:24:55,090 --> 03:24:55,490
Wait.

3264
03:24:55,650 --> 03:24:59,230
Oh, if you don't help her, you get to keep both of them,
right?

3265
03:25:04,160 --> 03:25:04,640
Wait.

3266
03:25:08,480 --> 03:25:10,680
The other one was...

3267
03:25:11,380 --> 03:25:12,520
Wait, who the fuck?

3268
03:25:12,580 --> 03:25:15,280
Wait, does it mean, like, if you don't...

3269
03:25:15,280 --> 03:25:15,660
Oh.

3270
03:25:16,100 --> 03:25:17,960
Oh, if you failed the hacking.

3271
03:25:18,120 --> 03:25:18,480
Okay.

3272
03:25:19,320 --> 03:25:20,780
So all of you are Phoenixes.

3273
03:25:20,920 --> 03:25:23,520
You and a player said fate is bullshit.

3274
03:25:23,880 --> 03:25:25,420
Oh, but that was a good choice, though.

3275
03:25:25,980 --> 03:25:27,180
I said a good thing.

3276
03:25:28,680 --> 03:25:31,280
You helped him escape with no energy two times.

3277
03:25:31,460 --> 03:25:34,160
You and 18% of players said, punch up my crew.

3278
03:25:35,180 --> 03:25:37,360
You successfully protected victory.

3279
03:25:37,800 --> 03:25:38,200
That's funny.

3280
03:25:38,860 --> 03:25:39,000
What?

3281
03:25:39,120 --> 03:25:41,340
None of you guys fucking joined the fight club?

3282
03:25:41,800 --> 03:25:46,360
Guys, we got Christmas bonus now, chat.

3283
03:25:46,840 --> 03:25:51,380
I can't believe it.

3284
03:25:52,880 --> 03:25:55,000
Your most sent hero is so now you perform better.

3285
03:25:55,540 --> 03:25:56,380
Yay, average.

3286
03:25:57,000 --> 03:25:57,520
Yippee.

3287
03:26:01,340 --> 03:26:03,800
You made him solo it.

3288
03:26:04,060 --> 03:26:04,640
Oh, you solo.

3289
03:26:04,820 --> 03:26:05,200
Oh.

3290
03:26:12,710 --> 03:26:15,150
Because nobody talks about Viqlo.

3291
03:26:16,570 --> 03:26:17,170
What?

3292
03:26:17,630 --> 03:26:17,910
Wait.

3293
03:26:19,410 --> 03:26:19,970
Oh, shit.

3294
03:26:20,530 --> 03:26:21,110
Whoa.

3295
03:26:21,630 --> 03:26:23,170
Oh, my God.

3296
03:26:23,910 --> 03:26:25,430
What the fuck?

3297
03:26:25,570 --> 03:26:25,970
Okay.

3298
03:26:26,750 --> 03:26:27,290
Oh, whoa.

3299
03:26:27,710 --> 03:26:28,690

3300
03:26:30,190 --> 03:26:30,630

03:26:33,350 --> 03:26:34,230
Ah.

3302
03:26:40,440 --> 03:26:41,980
Oh, thank God.

3303
03:26:42,940 --> 03:26:43,280
Okay.

3304
03:26:45,300 --> 03:26:46,140
Oh, gosh.

3305
03:26:46,980 --> 03:26:47,660
Oh, yeah.

3306
03:26:50,560 --> 03:26:53,560
Oh, my God.

3307
03:26:53,640 --> 03:26:55,000
What the fuck?

3308
03:26:55,540 --> 03:26:56,060
Oh, my God.

3309
03:26:56,260 --> 03:26:57,200
Is that me?

3310
03:27:01,980 --> 03:27:03,020
Oh, shit.

3311
03:27:03,680 --> 03:27:04,200
Oh,

3312
03:27:09,620 --> 03:27:09,720

3313
03:27:09,880 --> 03:27:10,380
Oh, okay.

3314
03:27:10,500 --> 03:27:11,000
It was a dream.

3315
03:27:11,320 --> 03:27:11,320
Okay.

3316
03:27:11,700 --> 03:27:11,700
Okay.

3317
03:27:13,060 --> 03:27:13,580
Okay.

3318
03:27:13,640 --> 03:27:14,040
Okay.

3319
03:27:14,280 --> 03:27:14,540
Oh.

3320
03:27:17,160 --> 03:27:17,680
Okay.

3321
03:27:17,680 --> 03:27:17,680

Yeah, no, no, fuck, okay.

People are like, you gotta put the sensor on.

3328
03:27:37,320 --> 03:27:38,960
You gotta, you gotta not use the sensor.

3329
03:27:39,120 --> 03:27:42,140
I, I, I don't know how the fuck I could get got away with
that.

3330
03:27:42,440 --> 03:27:44,740
I, oh my gosh, okay.

3331
03:27:49,800 --> 03:27:53,480
I'm glad I'm glad I put the sensor on I'm glad

3332
03:28:02,130 --> 03:28:06,510

You can tell one of the one who animated that was animating
some stuff on what's it called the Overwatch models.

3348
03:29:39,610 --> 03:29:41,270
They want to be the only supplier.

3349
03:29:41,910 --> 03:29:42,930
He looks rough.

3350
03:29:43,890 --> 03:29:43,890

animator.

03:29:56,350 --> 03:29:57,790
Hey, I was watching that.

3356
03:29:58,550 --> 03:30:01,770

3357
03:30:01,910 --> 03:30:02,730

Water boy used.

03:30:11,890 --> 03:30:13,630
To be fair, water gun is basically that.

03:30:14,110 --> 03:30:15,190

3369
03:30:33,470 --> 03:30:35,610
Like, what if it fucking explodes?

3370
03:30:41,690 --> 03:30:42,670
System power.

3371
03:30:48,590 --> 03:30:49,870
Simple locomotion.

3372
03:30:54,930 --> 03:30:56,210
Complex locomotion.

3373
03:30:57,170 --> 03:30:58,630
Like, what if the thing explodes?

3374
03:30:58,990 --> 03:30:59,970
We onto something, bro.

3375
03:31:00,650 --> 03:31:01,350
You know what?

3376
03:31:01,550 --> 03:31:02,650
Let's do jumping jacks.

3377
03:31:02,710 --> 03:31:03,370
This is gonna be it.

3378
03:31:05,190 --> 03:31:05,730
Let's go.

3379
03:31:05,850 --> 03:31:07,150
That's intensive as hell.

3380
03:31:07,710 --> 03:31:10,010
One, two, three.

3381
03:31:10,170 --> 03:31:19,850
four five my best subject bro if i can't even do jumping
jacks this shit is fucked

3382
03:31:26,160 --> 03:31:29,000
bro can't even pass the e-class

3383
03:31:34,860 --> 03:31:40,160
protopulse test seven failure no worries we'll get there

3384
03:31:48,210 --> 03:31:49,730
Royd, what is all this stuff?

3385
03:31:50,470 --> 03:31:52,830
The whole network expect me to process all the confiscated
stuff.

3386
03:31:53,630 --> 03:31:57,010
Because we the bottom branch for SDN, we catch all kinds of
shit work, bro.

3387
03:32:01,330 --> 03:32:03,110
Bro, she's checking out my flat ass.

3388
03:32:04,190 --> 03:32:07,610
We take one bad guy's stuff and use them for catch the other
bad guy.

3389
03:32:08,750 --> 03:32:09,670
Only good thing?

3390
03:32:10,250 --> 03:32:11,890
A lot of upgrade possibilities.

3391
03:32:14,590 --> 03:32:16,210
You ever jerk off in this thing?

3392
03:32:18,110 --> 03:32:20,190
Why do you want to know?

3393
03:32:20,430 --> 03:32:21,330
You should really be asking how often.

3394
03:32:22,530 --> 03:32:23,450
I gotta work on this.

3395
03:32:24,070 --> 03:32:24,790
Maybe I have.

3396
03:32:24,850 --> 03:32:25,550
Maybe I haven't.

3397
03:32:25,690 --> 03:32:26,410
What's it to you?

3398
03:32:26,750 --> 03:32:28,570
Just want to know why the buttons are sticky.

3399
03:32:29,570 --> 03:32:30,410
What the fuck?

3400
03:32:30,590 --> 03:32:35,710
She's joking, Royd, and her very specific off-putting way
that she jokes.

3401
03:32:35,710 --> 03:32:36,570
Oh, she's so into me.

3402
03:32:37,730 --> 03:32:39,590
Oh, she likes it.

3403
03:32:39,590 --> 03:32:40,890
She likes the bad thing.

3404
03:32:42,110 --> 03:32:43,270
Bro, she likes it.

3405
03:32:43,410 --> 03:32:45,010
She likes that bad thing.

3406
03:32:45,210 --> 03:32:46,010
Some other place.

3407
03:32:46,650 --> 03:32:47,430
I got work.

3408
03:32:47,570 --> 03:32:47,710
Yeah.

3409
03:32:47,730 --> 03:32:49,750
Robert was just leaving.

3410
03:32:50,090 --> 03:32:51,090
Look at that tension.

3411
03:32:51,890 --> 03:32:52,830
That's gonna be tough.

3412
03:32:53,210 --> 03:32:56,570
Because Blazer sent me to get you like half an hour ago.

3413
03:32:57,130 --> 03:33:00,670
So Roy will remember this, but he doesn't want to.

3414
03:33:04,250 --> 03:33:06,550
I'm forcing him to remember this.

3415
03:33:11,350 --> 03:33:11,750
Whoa!

3416
03:33:12,930 --> 03:33:13,210
Shit.

3417
03:33:13,570 --> 03:33:14,310
Blazer, sorry.

3418
03:33:15,090 --> 03:33:15,390
You know what?

3419
03:33:15,450 --> 03:33:16,110
I can come back.

3420
03:33:16,190 --> 03:33:17,010
Oh no, don't worry.

3421
03:33:17,350 --> 03:33:18,710
I got this thing tonight.

3422
03:33:18,930 --> 03:33:20,230
But you're still wearing a mask?

3423
03:33:20,350 --> 03:33:24,110
This isn't why you're here, but can you zip me up?

3424
03:33:24,290 --> 03:33:25,050
Oh, sure.

3425
03:33:25,250 --> 03:33:26,350
It's not mine.

3426
03:33:26,610 --> 03:33:30,030
By the way, they make me wear it, and it's back in a bag by
midnight.

3427
03:33:30,790 --> 03:33:32,150
What is happening today?

3428
03:33:32,830 --> 03:33:33,270
Yeah.

3429
03:33:33,790 --> 03:33:34,830
What's happening today?

3430
03:33:35,410 --> 03:33:36,790
The thing you're going to.

3431
03:33:37,130 --> 03:33:40,030
SDN sponsoring a dinner gala thing.

3432
03:33:40,790 --> 03:33:42,750
Radiant valor, a night of triumph.

3433
03:33:43,070 --> 03:33:44,850
Why does that sound like a propaganda rally?

3434
03:33:45,490 --> 03:33:45,650
There.

3435
03:33:45,890 --> 03:33:46,750
Thank you.

3436
03:33:46,830 --> 03:33:50,330
Yeah, it does kind of sound like some sort of fascist thing.

3437
03:33:50,350 --> 03:33:58,750
themed prom what do you think someone was like secret
identities by fucking you have your hair sticking out and

3438
03:33:58,750 --> 03:34:07,130
yet the bottom half of your face and your eye you can see
the eyes you're not hiding anything oh hey there's a nipple

3439
03:34:07,130 --> 03:34:18,410
out your ariola is showing no cause for alarm but a little
bit of your uh ariola is out it's like a slight hue shift oh

3440
03:34:18,410 --> 03:34:20,570
you might as well take that mask God.

3441
03:34:29,950 --> 03:34:33,710
You look incredible, girl.

3442
03:34:34,030 --> 03:34:35,930
I think you look incredible.

3443
03:34:36,650 --> 03:34:36,950
Thanks.

3444
03:34:37,910 --> 03:34:44,270
I was supposed to be going with him, but I don't think he's
going to be making it.

3445
03:34:44,750 --> 03:34:47,490
The downtown branch dropped him indefinite suspension.

3446
03:34:48,470 --> 03:34:48,510
What?

3447
03:34:48,890 --> 03:34:49,510
Is that your car?

3448
03:34:50,050 --> 03:34:51,510
And why did they drop him?

3449
03:34:51,570 --> 03:34:53,330
That's gonna be a weird insurance claim.

3450
03:34:53,450 --> 03:34:54,990
I'd like for you to talk to him.

3451
03:34:55,710 --> 03:34:56,510
Why me?

3452
03:34:56,770 --> 03:34:57,910
You're the pep talk guy.

3453
03:34:58,390 --> 03:35:00,210
You've been through a transition recently yourself.

3454
03:35:00,470 --> 03:35:02,490
I think he could use some perspective.

3455
03:35:02,850 --> 03:35:04,550
Like perspective to join the Z team?

3456
03:35:05,630 --> 03:35:06,870
Chase mentioned it.

3457
03:35:07,290 --> 03:35:07,510
Yeah.

3458
03:35:07,950 --> 03:35:10,410
The only candidates that make sense are him or Waterboy.

3459
03:35:11,310 --> 03:35:12,990
And at the moment, it's close.

3460
03:35:12,990 --> 03:35:14,970
Yeah, but he could drown himself in...

3461
03:35:14,970 --> 03:35:16,450
Mostly, I'd like you to get him out of the parking lot.

3462
03:35:16,490 --> 03:35:17,690
He can drown himself in work.

3463
03:35:18,470 --> 03:35:25,650
the edible arrangements he keeps sending them but with all
melon that's disgusting oh i'll see what i can do might as

3464
03:35:25,650 --> 03:35:31,150
well just send the strawberries i mean i'm allergic to
strawberries but i know that people from what i'm told

3465
03:35:31,150 --> 03:35:42,750
strawberries taste good i don't know though i'll never know
how you doing bud i have been better robert robertson the

3466
03:35:42,750 --> 03:35:44,610
blonde blazer and i have ended

3467
03:35:48,550 --> 03:35:51,970
I'm sorry for your, you know, your loss.

3468
03:35:52,090 --> 03:35:53,010
It's very abrupt.

3469
03:35:53,890 --> 03:35:56,750
One moment we were savoring uni straight from the urchin.

3470
03:35:57,450 --> 03:36:01,050
Next moment I'm contemplating flying into the sun.

3471
03:36:01,130 --> 03:36:01,850
What's stopping you?

3472
03:36:02,170 --> 03:36:05,050
Absorbing all its energy and casting this planet into
infinite darkness.

3473
03:36:05,050 --> 03:36:05,190
Oh, okay.

3474
03:36:05,310 --> 03:36:06,350
Yeah, no, I thought, okay.

3475
03:36:06,610 --> 03:36:07,690
Yeah, no, don't do that.

3476
03:36:08,490 --> 03:36:08,990
Yeah, no.

3477
03:36:10,250 --> 03:36:13,490
Maybe then I would be free of the torment in my soul.

3478
03:36:13,490 --> 03:36:23,230
maybe then I could quiet my mind these I've had those days
I've been there last time I went to a breakup I drank mezcal

3479
03:36:23,230 --> 03:36:30,950
I blacked out when I came to I was in a dark void surrounded
by the smell of rot and I was convinced I died and turned

3480
03:36:30,950 --> 03:36:39,050
into a zombie turns out I passed out at a urinal and
somebody threw me in a dumpster thank you for sharing that

3481
03:36:39,050 --> 03:36:48,510
you are sad enough to understand see we're just whoa think
there is someone else perhaps another lover could be the

3482
03:36:48,510 --> 03:37:01,670
cause of all this maybe she met a person i kissed her an
actual person it was me i'm only telling you this because i

3483
03:37:01,670 --> 03:37:09,710
don't want you hearing it from someone else yeah i kiss
blazer it was me That's right Before you incinerate me, it's

3484
03:37:09,710 --> 03:37:16,970
worth noting I had no idea she was in a relationship This
happened while we were together It just gets worse That's

3485
03:37:16,970 --> 03:37:26,930
right Yeah that's right You're a superhero And I'm a normal
guy And then I kissed it To blame for my sadness Maybe but I

3486
03:37:26,930 --> 03:37:33,190
doubt it It was me I guess this is something she was
thinking about It was me, Flash I'm not that good of a

3487
03:37:33,190 --> 03:37:37,670
kisser Oh, shit.

3488
03:37:37,890 --> 03:37:38,910
No, is he actually gonna kill me?

3489
03:37:42,510 --> 03:37:43,030
Wait.

3490
03:37:44,310 --> 03:37:45,730
And I can't romance him?

3491
03:37:47,350 --> 03:37:49,650
Bro, I could have romance her and him.

3492
03:37:51,550 --> 03:37:53,970
Wait, am I that of a kisser?

3493
03:37:55,130 --> 03:37:58,070
Bro, I have a girl that's having horny dreams of me.

3494
03:37:58,190 --> 03:37:58,950
There's no way.

3495
03:37:59,690 --> 03:38:00,230
Oh, shit.

3496
03:38:03,410 --> 03:38:03,930
Oh.

3497
03:38:03,930 --> 03:38:07,010
Aww, I can't even fly.

3498
03:38:08,110 --> 03:38:09,570
My kiss check failed.

3499
03:38:09,790 --> 03:38:10,810
I rolled a zero.

3500
03:38:12,370 --> 03:38:13,850
I didn't even know that was possible.

3501
03:38:14,850 --> 03:38:17,630
The dice, like, exploded when I tried to roll it.

3502
03:38:17,830 --> 03:38:19,970
I don't think taking a desk job would have me bleeding this
often.

3503
03:38:24,030 --> 03:38:25,050
What are you doing here?

3504
03:38:25,930 --> 03:38:28,010
I had a dream last night that we were fucking...

3505
03:38:28,010 --> 03:38:28,210
Huh?

3506
03:38:29,070 --> 03:38:30,930
Usually I don't remember my dreams, but...

3507
03:38:31,770 --> 03:38:32,450
Did I...

3508
03:38:32,450 --> 03:38:33,910
Was my...

3509
03:38:33,930 --> 03:38:35,110
Dick big.

3510
03:38:35,110 --> 03:38:36,630
Was it the one where I have a big dick?

3511
03:38:37,210 --> 03:38:38,410
Yeah, I'm sure you did.

3512
03:38:39,130 --> 03:38:39,610
Nice.

3513
03:38:41,890 --> 03:38:43,010
I gotta know.

3514
03:38:43,710 --> 03:38:44,450
I gotta know.

3515
03:38:45,070 --> 03:38:47,490
I'm doing that thing where I imagine being with someone.

3516
03:38:47,750 --> 03:38:48,390
Was it above average?

3517
03:38:49,210 --> 03:38:50,290
See how it feels, how it looks.

3518
03:38:50,790 --> 03:38:52,750
You know, like trying on a dress.

3519
03:38:53,890 --> 03:38:54,630
You were there.

3520
03:38:55,170 --> 03:38:55,810
I could have been.

3521
03:38:56,150 --> 03:38:58,150
I just wanted to know it was above average.

3522
03:38:58,630 --> 03:38:58,830
I could be anywhere.

3523
03:39:00,610 --> 03:39:01,090
Oh.

3524
03:39:01,570 --> 03:39:02,710

Alright, here.

03:40:24,880 --> 03:40:26,000
You got this.

03:40:27,660 --> 03:40:28,460
You're strong?

3542
03:40:31,140 --> 03:40:32,140
Yeah, I believe.

3543
03:40:32,340 --> 03:40:34,360
I've been hearing a lot about some guy named Chad.

3544
03:40:34,800 --> 03:40:36,700
I think he's trying to summon a demon.

3545
03:40:36,960 --> 03:40:38,300
He's like, punch up his catapest.

3546
03:40:38,460 --> 03:40:39,380
Anyway, I'm gonna send him out.

3547
03:40:39,440 --> 03:40:39,680
Chad?

3548
03:40:40,040 --> 03:40:40,260
Yeah.

3549
03:40:43,380 --> 03:40:44,700
Send, join the club.

3550
03:40:44,820 --> 03:40:45,760
I mean, I do know where the church is.

3551
03:40:45,900 --> 03:40:46,760
I could snoop around.

3552
03:40:47,160 --> 03:40:48,180
Let's do it.

3553
03:40:49,040 --> 03:40:49,420
Alright.

3554
03:40:51,440 --> 03:40:52,540

Oh, can I send more people?

3556
03:40:54,360 --> 03:40:54,920
You know what?

3557
03:40:55,240 --> 03:40:55,920
Fuck it.

3558
03:40:56,140 --> 03:40:57,160
Aren't you persistent?

3559
03:41:00,120 --> 03:41:00,960
Easy enough.

3560
03:41:03,680 --> 03:41:04,380

3561
03:41:04,860 --> 03:41:05,820

3562
03:41:05,820 --> 03:41:06,640
Should I send two?

3563
03:41:06,960 --> 03:41:07,680

3564
03:41:07,780 --> 03:41:08,240

Oh, man.

3576
03:41:58,460 --> 03:41:59,680

Don't see it, dude.

3605
03:42:54,560 --> 03:42:54,920
Shit.

3606
03:42:55,580 --> 03:42:56,260
Why do you need it?

3607
03:42:56,300 --> 03:42:56,860
You're in the field.

3608
03:42:57,120 --> 03:42:58,180
I just want to make sure it's there.

3609
03:42:58,400 --> 03:42:59,580
It's a very nice stapler.

3610
03:43:00,720 --> 03:43:02,420
I should upgrade the other stuff now.

3611
03:43:02,440 --> 03:43:03,900
This is Jason from nostalgia alley.

3612
03:43:04,280 --> 03:43:06,040
Someone just dropped off a box of games of the no.

3613
03:43:06,080 --> 03:43:09,260
Search through the inbound and disarm a bomb.

3614
03:43:10,720 --> 03:43:11,180
Okay, well.

3615
03:43:11,340 --> 03:43:11,860
Where the hell did you go?

3616
03:43:11,920 --> 03:43:13,160
Job's not finished, dude.

3617
03:43:13,360 --> 03:43:15,640
We need you to bring everything up to our new place.

3618
03:43:19,460 --> 03:43:23,460
Unload the heavy furniture and boxes into the new.

3619
03:43:23,660 --> 03:43:26,180
Carry the blinds up for flights of stairs.

3620
03:43:26,580 --> 03:43:29,020
Who was it that I told to do that?

3621
03:43:29,300 --> 03:43:30,980
I don't remember.

3622
03:43:32,720 --> 03:43:34,900
Okay, we can wait a little bit.

3623
03:43:35,740 --> 03:43:39,280
We'll wait a little bit because I don't have people right
now.

3624
03:43:40,020 --> 03:43:41,660
Alright, search through.

3625
03:43:42,180 --> 03:43:42,620
Okay.

3626
03:43:50,150 --> 03:43:52,130
I mean, you can do that.

3627
03:43:56,290 --> 03:43:57,310
I've got the bandwidth.

3628
03:44:00,590 --> 03:44:01,670
It's two for one.

3629
03:44:01,890 --> 03:44:02,670
Oh, that's true.

3630
03:44:03,890 --> 03:44:05,430
Okay, we'll send these two out there.

3631
03:44:05,690 --> 03:44:07,230
And then- Yo, Mal, can we check out that ramen shop?

3632
03:44:07,530 --> 03:44:09,210
Bro, you get so cranky.

3633
03:44:09,370 --> 03:44:10,170

03:44:13,150 --> 03:44:14,010
Head and over.

03:44:14,830 --> 03:44:15,710
How's my hair?

3637
03:44:15,910 --> 03:44:17,070
Perfect as always.

3638
03:44:17,110 --> 03:44:17,690
Is he not?

3639
03:44:17,870 --> 03:44:19,170
Bro, use your special power.

3640
03:44:20,790 --> 03:44:21,370
Oh, man.

3641
03:44:21,890 --> 03:44:22,370
Oh, there we go.

3642
03:44:23,430 --> 03:44:23,750
There we go.

3643
03:44:24,790 --> 03:44:25,750
We're doing it, guys.

3644
03:44:25,830 --> 03:44:26,470
I'm learning it.

3645
03:44:26,510 --> 03:44:27,810
We need you to send somebody else.

3646
03:44:28,470 --> 03:44:29,310
This is too much.

3647
03:44:29,650 --> 03:44:30,910
We're out of somebody's.

3648
03:44:31,070 --> 03:44:31,910

03:44:36,870 --> 03:44:37,530
Okay, thank God.

3653
03:44:38,570 --> 03:44:39,590
We made it.

3654
03:44:39,790 --> 03:44:40,530
The level was right.

3655
03:44:40,530 --> 03:44:41,830
I knew you guys got this.

3656
03:44:42,050 --> 03:44:43,390
This would be a breeze.

3657
03:44:43,790 --> 03:44:45,670
I can't believe I'm saying this, but...

3658
03:44:45,670 --> 03:44:45,830
Oh.

3659
03:44:45,910 --> 03:44:46,870

3663
03:44:50,190 --> 03:44:52,410
Which team is hiding the bomb?

3664
03:44:53,690 --> 03:44:54,710
Man bomber?

3665
03:44:56,310 --> 03:44:58,090

03:48:21,170 --> 03:48:21,930
He's a mind reader.

3717
03:48:22,590 --> 03:48:23,810
She has X-ray vision.

3718
03:48:24,670 --> 03:48:25,650
Together they are.

3719
03:48:25,870 --> 03:48:26,930
Send someone...

3720
03:48:27,510 --> 03:48:27,830
Privacy.

3721
03:48:28,390 --> 03:48:29,210
Okay, I think...

3722
03:48:29,210 --> 03:48:29,510
Oh, sorry.

3723
03:48:29,730 --> 03:48:30,290
Is this SDN?

3724
03:48:30,830 --> 03:48:31,410
We need help.

3725
03:48:32,370 --> 03:48:32,850
Okay, wait.

3726
03:48:33,430 --> 03:48:33,870
Obviously...

3727
03:48:33,870 --> 03:48:34,810
No, you're not doing this.

3728
03:48:35,790 --> 03:48:36,070
Alright.

3729
03:48:36,690 --> 03:48:37,350

03:48:38,150 --> 03:48:38,770
You're training.

3731
03:48:39,210 --> 03:48:39,690
You know what?

3732
03:48:39,810 --> 03:48:40,490
Go do your thing.

Oh, is tracking intelligence?

3747
03:49:57,610 --> 03:49:59,150
Oh, we are so fucking stupid.

3748
03:49:59,670 --> 03:49:59,690

We can burn.

3752
03:50:06,570 --> 03:50:07,030
Chat.

3753
03:50:08,950 --> 03:50:10,230
Standing alive.

Okay.

Wow, guys.

3756
03:50:12,570 --> 03:50:14,210
What a lucky guess.

3757
03:50:15,950 --> 03:50:16,590
Oh.

3758
03:50:17,130 --> 03:50:18,270

3759
03:50:18,350 --> 03:50:19,390
He fucking left.

03:50:21,790 --> 03:50:32,970
activate crawl through the vents guys we have zero
intelligence which one is not the I feel like crawl crawl

3761
03:50:32,970 --> 03:50:43,950

3763
03:50:50,970 --> 03:50:51,170
All right.

3764
03:50:52,150 --> 03:50:53,690
I'll put you two in here.

3765
03:50:53,790 --> 03:50:55,610
Robert, you were the last one to see my stapler.

3766
03:50:56,230 --> 03:50:56,750
What was I?

3767
03:50:57,350 --> 03:50:58,250
I don't think that's true.

3768
03:50:58,490 --> 03:50:59,510
You're the prime suspect.

3769
03:50:59,770 --> 03:51:00,870
Oh, come on.

3770
03:51:01,690 --> 03:51:01,850
What?

3771
03:51:02,210 --> 03:51:03,450
Oh, oh, oh, it doesn't matter.

3772
03:51:03,650 --> 03:51:04,130
It doesn't matter.

3773
03:51:04,250 --> 03:51:04,950
Let's go.

3774
03:51:05,830 --> 03:51:06,450
We did it.

3775
03:51:06,650 --> 03:51:07,850
We detained the youths.

3776
03:51:07,890 --> 03:51:08,950
Yeah, fuck the children.

3777
03:51:10,730 --> 03:51:13,990
We tried to do it ourselves, but then I remembered my motto
in life.

3778
03:51:14,330 --> 03:51:16,350
Why do it when you can make someone else do it for you?

3779
03:51:16,350 --> 03:51:16,990
Oh, he's smart.

3780
03:51:17,390 --> 03:51:17,410
Okay.

3781
03:51:20,070 --> 03:51:21,690
That requires a brain.

3782
03:51:22,210 --> 03:51:24,350
Wait, we're doing, like, task rabbit here.

3783
03:51:25,450 --> 03:51:25,450
What?

3784
03:51:25,570 --> 03:51:25,890
No, Phil.

3785
03:51:25,930 --> 03:51:26,950
Can you just walk him around?

3786
03:51:27,090 --> 03:51:27,670
Walk Phil.

3787
03:51:28,050 --> 03:51:29,570
Phil is imposed hard.

3788
03:51:29,930 --> 03:51:30,190
God damn it.

3789
03:51:30,250 --> 03:51:31,110
Okay, we can wait a little.

3790
03:51:32,610 --> 03:51:33,350
That's fine.

3791
03:51:33,630 --> 03:51:35,110
Okay, we need someone strong.

3792
03:51:36,070 --> 03:51:36,870
Oh, disrupted.

3793
03:51:38,290 --> 03:51:39,250
Yeah, we can be in.

3794
03:51:39,750 --> 03:51:41,490
Oh, I'll get to the bottom of this shit.

3795
03:51:44,390 --> 03:51:44,830
Alright, nice.

3796
03:51:44,930 --> 03:51:46,190
I'm glad there's no Grammy for this.

3797
03:51:47,310 --> 03:51:48,050
We did it.

gone from shaking his fist at cars to sadly directing

charisma i had no idea blazer was such a heartbreaker is

3805
03:52:50,030 --> 03:52:51,630
It takes two to walk a dog.

3806
03:52:54,770 --> 03:52:55,830
Robert, I found my stapler.

3807
03:52:56,650 --> 03:52:57,350
Where was it?

3808
03:52:57,590 --> 03:52:58,510
The immobility.

3809
03:52:59,250 --> 03:53:00,330
Actually, the combat.

3810
03:53:02,590 --> 03:53:02,870
And...

3811
03:53:03,150 --> 03:53:05,290

03:53:06,730 --> 03:53:07,890
I'll put her...

3813
03:53:07,890 --> 03:53:10,470
I'll make her more of a all-around person.

3814
03:53:10,570 --> 03:53:12,710
Hey, it's Jerry from Comic Pug.

3815
03:53:13,410 --> 03:53:15,330
We got a gift of some Mega Man replicas.

3816
03:53:15,830 --> 03:53:18,270

Whoa, what are you doing?

3833
03:55:27,350 --> 03:55:27,350
Whatever.

3834
03:55:27,650 --> 03:55:28,310
It was an accident.

3835
03:55:28,710 --> 03:55:30,930
Just aim your dick up and water piss it off.

3836
03:55:31,250 --> 03:55:32,290
That's not...

3837
03:55:32,930 --> 03:55:33,330
You...

3838
03:55:34,190 --> 03:55:37,670
To be fair, he wasn't being a really bad janitor, though.

3839
03:55:37,670 --> 03:55:40,510
How would you like to have to walk around work the rest of
the day with shit all of you?

3840
03:55:40,530 --> 03:55:40,990
I don't know.

3841
03:55:41,070 --> 03:55:41,850
I don't think about that.

3842
03:55:41,970 --> 03:55:42,790
Because it won't happen.

3843
03:55:42,970 --> 03:55:45,370
Because I'm not a fucking idiot food thrower away here.

3844
03:55:45,650 --> 03:55:46,590
It was an accident.

3845
03:55:46,710 --> 03:55:48,290
You don't have to be a bully about it.

3846
03:55:48,530 --> 03:55:49,610
You want this in your report?

3847
03:55:50,010 --> 03:55:51,450
Well, are you gonna snitch on me?

3848
03:55:51,930 --> 03:55:52,290
Yeah?

3849
03:55:53,130 --> 03:55:55,810
Wait, I can't even snitch on it.

3850
03:55:55,930 --> 03:55:57,190
There was being a soft bitch about it.

3851
03:55:58,350 --> 03:55:58,750
Bully.

3852
03:55:59,670 --> 03:56:00,210
How am I being?

3853
03:56:02,510 --> 03:56:03,570
In fact!

3854
03:56:05,890 --> 03:56:07,010
Oh, wow.

3855
03:56:07,130 --> 03:56:09,230
I wasn't expecting it to go straight.

3856
03:56:09,810 --> 03:56:10,450
That was extra.

3857
03:56:10,950 --> 03:56:11,270
Sorry.

3858
03:56:11,930 --> 03:56:12,950
Spaghetti or spaghetti?

3859
03:56:13,470 --> 03:56:14,950
You're gonna choke on this fucking...

3860
03:56:14,950 --> 03:56:16,390
Hey, Robert, could you...

3861
03:56:16,390 --> 03:56:17,070
Spaghetti.

3862
03:56:18,630 --> 03:56:19,610
Did you eat my lunch?

3863
03:56:20,150 --> 03:56:21,190
Why would you do that?

3864
03:56:22,490 --> 03:56:30,530
don't want to be a snitch but flambé was really payback
another hr report i don't even think they have hr well if

3865
03:56:30,530 --> 03:56:37,170

get cleaned up then clean this up then pick me up a blt from

3866
03:56:37,170 --> 03:56:48,330

like okay i feel like working hr for superheroes is like

3867
03:56:48,330 --> 03:56:52,770
anyway you don't have enough pay for that Who's it going to
be?

3868
03:56:53,130 --> 03:56:54,270
Phenomenon or Waterboy?

3869
03:56:55,130 --> 03:56:57,250
And these two are my only options.

3870
03:56:57,930 --> 03:56:58,750
For now, yeah.

3871
03:56:59,350 --> 03:57:00,550
Obviously, we can revisit it.

3872
03:57:00,790 --> 03:57:03,810
But Waterboy is already a trainee, sort of.

3873
03:57:03,930 --> 03:57:06,570
And you already know Phenomenon got cut by DTLA.

3874
03:57:07,190 --> 03:57:09,070
Thanks for getting him out of the parking lot, by the way.

3875
03:57:09,590 --> 03:57:14,770
It might also help to get, you know, an actual good person
on your team, which...

3876
03:57:14,770 --> 03:57:15,150
Wait.

3877
03:57:15,990 --> 03:57:17,270
Are we cutting someone?

3878
03:57:19,110 --> 03:57:21,450
Like, if I pick someone, do I cut, put him?

3879
03:57:21,470 --> 03:57:35,670
on my team or uh joining my team okay i'm picking someone
join i am not picking water boy guys i there's no way if

3880
03:57:35,670 --> 03:57:46,290
anything phenomena like phenomena as act is a real fucking
superhero like like why i don't bro

3881
03:57:51,470 --> 03:57:59,290
I'd rather have a depressed Superman than someone that can't
do anything Like it was at least a depressed Superman We

3882
03:57:59,290 --> 03:58:08,850

04:11:00,910 --> 04:11:01,570
You hate pets.

4048
04:11:02,450 --> 04:11:04,810
I hate pets with bad attitudes.

4049
04:11:05,590 --> 04:11:06,610
What pets have good attitudes?

4050
04:11:07,250 --> 04:11:07,550
Snakes.

4051
04:11:08,250 --> 04:11:08,770
Snakes?

4052
04:11:09,770 --> 04:11:10,690
I guess so.

4053
04:11:10,770 --> 04:11:11,470
They're just chill.

4054
04:11:11,670 --> 04:11:12,730
Every snake is chill.

4055
04:11:13,090 --> 04:11:14,030
You just sit there.

4056
04:11:14,870 --> 04:11:18,110
I have recently learned of the American opossum.

4057
04:11:18,870 --> 04:11:21,630
I find it fascinating how it carries its children's heart.

4058
04:11:22,870 --> 04:11:24,350
Much like a bus.

4059
04:11:25,770 --> 04:11:27,970
Yeah, what the fuck is he talking about?

4060
04:11:28,890 --> 04:11:30,210
Possums aren't pets, man.

4061
04:11:30,610 --> 04:11:30,950
I see.

4062
04:11:31,990 --> 04:11:33,010
That's not true.

4063
04:11:33,230 --> 04:11:35,170
You can technically any animal can be...

4064
04:11:35,170 --> 04:11:36,110
No, actually, don't do not.

4065
04:11:36,450 --> 04:11:36,870
No, no, no, no, no.

4066
04:11:36,950 --> 04:11:38,030
Wait, don't quote me on that.

4067
04:11:38,350 --> 04:11:39,050
Don't quote me that.

4068
04:11:39,230 --> 04:11:39,510
I'm not...

4069
04:11:39,510 --> 04:11:41,790
I'm not in for exotic animals, guys.

4070
04:11:42,130 --> 04:11:43,010
Not all pet...

4071
04:11:43,010 --> 04:11:43,610
Guys, no, no, no.

4072
04:11:43,630 --> 04:11:44,450
All pets can be...

4073
04:11:44,450 --> 04:11:46,230
Not all animals can be pets, guys.

4074
04:11:47,650 --> 04:11:48,530
That is it.

4075
04:11:48,530 --> 04:11:50,150
Not all animals can be pets.

4076
04:11:50,250 --> 04:11:51,690
Guys, I don't want to get in trouble.

4077
04:11:51,930 --> 04:12:05,530
uh make fight the mascot during half time make it look
convincing but pull your punches maybe these two do i need

4078
04:12:05,530 --> 04:12:16,070

whatever i wasn't sure about it either i don't know that

4079
04:12:16,070 --> 04:12:17,950
you're trying to tell me something but

4080
04:12:21,930 --> 04:12:25,810
I don't know if you need intelligence for that.

4081
04:12:26,610 --> 04:12:27,450
You need combat.

4082
04:12:27,690 --> 04:12:28,710
Yeah, I feel like I need...

4083
04:12:28,710 --> 04:12:30,090
You know, I'll put Kodam in here.

4084
04:12:30,910 --> 04:12:31,650
We can do it.

4085
04:12:32,590 --> 04:12:33,250
I don't know.

4086
04:12:33,830 --> 04:12:34,570
Depends on the dirt.

4087
04:12:35,570 --> 04:12:36,910
Oh, hacking time.

4088
04:12:37,290 --> 04:12:38,410
Ah, you lucky bastard.

4089
04:12:38,430 --> 04:12:40,070
Hacked into the computer.

4090
04:12:40,170 --> 04:12:41,230
Oh, it's no difficulty.

4091
04:12:41,350 --> 04:12:42,110
I got this.

4092
04:12:42,910 --> 04:12:44,010
That's for babies.

4093
04:12:44,370 --> 04:12:44,790
Look at that.

4094
04:12:46,730 --> 04:12:47,510
What's this?

4095
04:12:47,950 --> 04:12:49,450
Okay, I gotta get a key for that.

4096
04:12:51,470 --> 04:12:51,910
Okay.

4097
04:12:51,930 --> 04:12:54,690
Oh, oh, oh wait, I'm timed.

4098
04:12:54,890 --> 04:12:56,050
Oh, I was not paying attention.

4099
04:13:00,650 --> 04:13:01,470
Oh, shit.

4100
04:13:02,790 --> 04:13:03,610
Oh, fuck.

4101
04:13:04,010 --> 04:13:04,010
Okay.

4102
04:13:08,480 --> 04:13:10,100
Oh, this is hard.

4103
04:13:16,740 --> 04:13:18,000
Okay, we got this.

4104
04:13:19,040 --> 04:13:20,060
Right, right, down.

4105
04:13:20,280 --> 04:13:21,460
Okay, right, right, right, down.

4106
04:13:22,940 --> 04:13:24,280
Right, right, down.

04:13:28,810 --> 04:13:29,610
Oh, what?

04:13:29,910 --> 04:13:30,530
Oh, shit.

4109
04:13:30,690 --> 04:13:31,310
Oh, fuck.

4110
04:13:31,470 --> 04:13:32,010
Oh, oh.

4112
04:13:35,590 --> 04:13:36,710
Right, right, down.

4113
04:13:38,550 --> 04:13:39,130
Okay.

4114
04:13:45,270 --> 04:13:46,790
I gotta block him off?

4115
04:13:49,930 --> 04:13:50,490
No!

4116
04:13:51,030 --> 04:13:51,390
No!

4117

04:16:28,670 --> 04:16:30,930
But convince the boss if all fails.

Okay.

Wait, actually, maybe he's returning.

4169
04:16:40,090 --> 04:16:41,990
Hello, dispatcher.

04:16:45,130 --> 04:16:45,830
What kind of game?

4173
04:16:46,050 --> 04:16:46,970
A brain teaser.

4174
04:16:47,830 --> 04:16:48,750
A brain teaser.

Okay, we can wait a little bit.

4214
04:18:48,390 --> 04:18:49,750
We can wait a little bit.

4215
04:18:51,130 --> 04:18:51,570
Alright.

4216
04:18:52,230 --> 04:18:52,670
Alright.

04:18:54,010 --> 04:18:55,890
Okay, but we don't have enough intelligence, though.

4218
04:18:56,030 --> 04:18:56,710
That's the thing.

4219
04:18:57,430 --> 04:18:57,790
Wait, okay.

4220
04:18:57,950 --> 04:19:01,030
He's gonna do this, and then I'm gonna...

4221

I'm gonna give it to the bat.

4222
04:19:04,830 --> 04:19:05,610
There we go.

4223
04:19:06,690 --> 04:19:08,150
I just want to wait for him to return.

4224
04:19:09,250 --> 04:19:10,010
This is fine.

4225
04:19:10,470 --> 04:19:11,150
Oh, my gosh.

4226
04:19:11,270 --> 04:19:11,490
Okay.

4227
04:19:12,530 --> 04:19:13,570
This is still fine.

4228
04:19:15,230 --> 04:19:17,870
No, we invested it all on one guy.

4229
04:19:19,710 --> 04:19:20,250
It's fine.

4230
04:19:20,810 --> 04:19:21,930
All right, and then he returns.

4231
04:19:22,290 --> 04:19:23,790
Half-bath all freak.

4232
04:19:24,010 --> 04:19:27,510
He's going to return and he's going to be teaser me this.

4233
04:19:29,110 --> 04:19:29,970
There you go.

4234
04:19:30,970 --> 04:19:32,110
Hero, go do your thing.

4235
04:19:32,870 --> 04:19:34,210
Do your riddle.

4236
04:19:35,190 --> 04:19:37,270
It was stand up beer bottles.

4237
04:19:37,450 --> 04:19:38,550
Cheer up and persuade.

4238
04:19:38,690 --> 04:19:39,570
Okay, we can just do these two.

4239
04:19:41,070 --> 04:19:41,690
Oh, he's back.

4240
04:19:41,810 --> 04:19:43,010
He's not depressed anymore.

4241
04:19:43,530 --> 04:19:45,090
Intercom malfunctioning.

4242
04:19:46,350 --> 04:19:47,090
Can anyone hear me?

4243
04:19:47,410 --> 04:19:48,490
More intelligence.

4244
04:19:49,510 --> 04:19:50,350
All right, there we go.

4245
04:19:51,050 --> 04:19:53,050
I believe in depressed, the Phenomenon.

4246
04:19:54,890 --> 04:20:05,470
okay we'll start what is my favorite game the wolf within us
i don't know no brainy 1949 the wolves have eyes the wolves

least 30 what the fuck is wrong with your head?

4251
04:20:55,980 --> 04:20:56,860
There's no skull.

4252
04:20:57,340 --> 04:20:58,480
He has no skull.

4253
04:20:58,740 --> 04:20:59,700
It's just brain.

4254
04:21:01,180 --> 04:21:02,960
Time to freak some fuckers out.

4255
04:21:03,800 --> 04:21:03,920
Alright.

4256
04:21:05,240 --> 04:21:06,200
More intelligence.

4257
04:21:07,620 --> 04:21:09,360
Actually, I don't think I need more intelligence, actually.

4258
04:21:09,660 --> 04:21:11,460
I think we can chill a bit on that.

4259
04:21:11,940 --> 04:21:14,040
I think we can chill a little bit.

4260
04:21:14,980 --> 04:21:17,260
Maybe more intelligence is not the best thing.

4261
04:21:17,460 --> 04:21:17,640
You know what?

4262
04:21:17,660 --> 04:21:18,780
Let's give you intelligence.

4263
04:21:20,300 --> 04:21:21,420
You're my all around it.

4264
04:21:22,420 --> 04:21:23,780
He was the brain teaser.

4265
04:21:26,400 --> 04:21:35,440
Are you aware your entire head is just brain like like you

Oh, nice.

Just one.

4272
04:21:59,280 --> 04:22:00,540
That's the hacking one.

4273
04:22:00,780 --> 04:22:02,960
But we don't need to worry about that.

4274
04:22:03,740 --> 04:22:04,100
Yeah!

4275
04:22:05,260 --> 04:22:06,800
I got here another injury.

04:22:10,980 --> 04:22:11,400
Oh, my God.

4277
04:22:11,500 --> 04:22:12,580
I swear to God, it was another.

4278
04:22:13,020 --> 04:22:14,440
It was another one.

4279
04:22:15,160 --> 04:22:16,860
Ooh, it's good with mobility.

4280
04:22:19,040 --> 04:22:20,180

04:22:20,640 --> 04:22:21,340
We'll put it.

4282
04:22:23,480 --> 04:22:24,200
We'll give it to you.

4283
04:22:24,840 --> 04:22:25,380

04:23:51,890 --> 04:23:53,910
Thank you for the super chat, Disney.

04:23:54,290 --> 04:23:55,150
Thank you, thank you.

4292
04:24:00,990 --> 04:24:03,730
Oh my god, he's finally getting his first extra tie.

4293
04:24:06,370 --> 04:24:06,770
Same.

4294
04:24:11,050 --> 04:24:13,570
It's like, what you want me to do?

4295
04:24:14,290 --> 04:24:15,410
Fucking it, loser.

4296
04:24:16,290 --> 04:24:17,390
You're crazy.

4297
04:24:19,510 --> 04:24:20,630
Fucking crazy.

4298
04:24:23,550 --> 04:24:25,250
Oh, it's depression, man.

4299
04:24:29,740 --> 04:24:32,220
Also, do they even do superhero stuff anymore?

4300
04:24:32,840 --> 04:24:35,360
I swear she just does office work instead.

4301
04:24:35,700 --> 04:24:39,980
Earlier that day, Blazer and I had breakfast at the rim of
an active volcano.

4302
04:24:41,100 --> 04:24:42,160
Then we made love.

4303
04:24:42,920 --> 04:24:44,960
I don't need to hear your sex stories.

4304
04:24:45,400 --> 04:24:46,660
We never had intercourse.

4305
04:24:47,300 --> 04:24:49,840
My alien genitals were not compatible.

4306
04:24:51,040 --> 04:24:52,060
That's cool.

4307
04:24:53,000 --> 04:24:54,180
Why is that cool?

4308
04:24:55,240 --> 04:24:56,020
It's, uh, it's not.

4309
04:24:56,900 --> 04:24:57,860
What were you saying?

4310
04:24:58,420 --> 04:25:01,020
She was the only thing I was passionate about.

4311
04:25:01,560 --> 04:25:04,460
Her voice, her eyes, her eyes, and disposition.

4312
04:25:05,260 --> 04:25:08,680
Her whole of her remarkable corporeal form.

4313
04:25:08,940 --> 04:25:09,480
How do you know?

4314
04:25:09,500 --> 04:25:13,240
How do you know she's the only thing you're passionate about
if you haven't found anything else you're passionate about?

4315
04:25:13,320 --> 04:25:13,720
Exactly.

4316
04:25:14,200 --> 04:25:16,300
Your logic with that statement.

4317
04:25:16,320 --> 04:25:18,100
You have to laugh so.

4318
04:25:18,100 --> 04:25:20,360
Oh, the one she dumped it, bro.

4319
04:25:20,640 --> 04:25:25,000
What you need to do is find the next thing for you to be
passionate about.

4320
04:25:26,060 --> 04:25:27,240
Because it's out there.

4321
04:25:28,120 --> 04:25:28,820
Thank you.

4322
04:25:29,220 --> 04:25:31,240
I wish to make a love to you again.

4323
04:25:33,180 --> 04:25:33,780
Oh, is that...

4324
04:25:33,780 --> 04:25:35,720
But this time, I will avoid squeezing the blood out.

4325
04:25:35,720 --> 04:25:36,560
Wait, what?

4326
04:25:36,660 --> 04:25:38,140
That's how he fucks?

4327
04:25:40,880 --> 04:25:41,400
Bro!

4328
04:25:42,000 --> 04:25:43,040
Oh, okay.

4329
04:25:43,500 --> 04:25:44,020
Okay.

4330
04:25:45,680 --> 04:25:48,080
I did not realize Hugging was...

4331
04:25:48,100 --> 04:25:50,600
his form of intercourse.

4332
04:25:51,100 --> 04:25:56,000
What you watching?

4333
04:25:58,700 --> 04:26:00,320
Technically, you're still on the clock.

4334
04:26:01,220 --> 04:26:03,320
Another HR violation right there.

4335
04:26:03,380 --> 04:26:05,880
On the clock, you shouldn't be pegging me with anything,
Robert.

4336
04:26:06,360 --> 04:26:07,840
That's extremely inappropriate.

4337
04:26:08,420 --> 04:26:10,040
Especially since I'm usually the picker.

4338
04:26:10,700 --> 04:26:12,140
Oh, he's definitely a hugger.

4339
04:26:12,460 --> 04:26:13,460
Well, tell me how it is.

4340
04:26:13,520 --> 04:26:17,400
These ESL turkeys don't make fun of him.

4341
04:26:18,100 --> 04:26:25,720
forget what i'm watching by the time the movie starts same
you going solo i'm alone or ravi a rebel that night feel bad

4342
04:26:25,720 --> 04:26:32,300
asking people to pay when i'm just gonna sneak in the only
lame thing is i can't get snacks floating buckets of popcorn

4343
04:26:32,300 --> 04:26:45,580
too tend to draw a lot of attention but i miss it i miss
popcorn just get popcorn just going to the theater oh bro

4344
04:26:45,580 --> 04:26:49,360

4345
04:26:50,820 --> 04:26:53,040
Are you fucking kidding me?

4346
04:26:53,760 --> 04:26:55,100
You want a bad bitch?

4347
04:26:55,440 --> 04:26:56,220
Oh, bro.

4348
04:27:00,020 --> 04:27:03,800
You want a bad bitch or a muscle mommy?

4349
04:27:04,200 --> 04:27:07,440
That's so hard to pick, man.

4350
04:27:09,340 --> 04:27:17,740
The thing is, Invisigal, Visi already showed us what she can
do.

4351
04:27:18,100 --> 04:27:21,580
But we haven't seen what Blazer could do, guys.

4352
04:27:21,840 --> 04:27:23,080
That's the thing.

4353
04:27:27,200 --> 04:27:33,080
like, the thing is, but we haven't, they haven't shown us
what she could do.

4354
04:27:33,580 --> 04:27:36,080
We saw what the other girl could do.

4355
04:27:38,860 --> 04:27:39,460
like,

4356
04:27:47,740 --> 04:27:50,940
oh, like, we, we haven't been shown everything.

4357
04:27:53,320 --> 04:28:04,040
Must allow me no question So sad, I'm thinking with a super
chat Don't be greedy But, but like But I love being greedy

4358

folks Pick Nader.

Thank you.

4363
04:28:27,680 --> 04:28:32,200
People who think Pink Blazer is seeing people who think salt
is spicy.

4364
04:28:32,580 --> 04:28:34,560
But we don't even know if she's freaky.

4365
04:28:35,020 --> 04:28:36,420
You don't know that.

4366
04:28:36,780 --> 04:28:39,560
You don't even know if she's freaky or not.

4367
04:28:41,260 --> 04:28:43,480
She never even had.

4368
04:28:44,200 --> 04:28:47,400
She never even had the Mecca Man, though.

4369
04:28:47,640 --> 04:28:48,660

04:28:48,760 --> 04:28:51,020

No big fixing her.

Convince your people.

4385
04:30:22,750 --> 04:30:24,730
Convince your people, why?

4386
04:30:25,610 --> 04:30:27,850
She got no play.

4387
04:30:30,430 --> 04:30:31,990
Because of muscle.

4388
04:30:33,470 --> 04:30:35,590
Do we even need to explain it?

4389
04:30:37,230 --> 04:30:44,690
All I'm saying, guys, all I'm saying is that, bro, she has
been dating Depression Man for how long?

4390
04:30:44,850 --> 04:30:47,470
And, like, they never were able to do anything.

4391
04:30:47,910 --> 04:30:49,850
So you know, she freaky.

4392
04:30:51,890 --> 04:30:52,490

your flat ass off my bench.

4568
04:43:42,010 --> 04:43:43,290
This is so true.

04:43:43,810 --> 04:43:45,770
Bro, his ass is so fucking flat.

04:43:46,390 --> 04:43:47,930
You know, this squad like that bay.

4572
04:43:51,550 --> 04:43:53,850
Aw, look, he got me a gift.

4573
04:43:56,350 --> 04:43:57,290
Bro, that bay.

4574
04:43:57,490 --> 04:44:01,630
Bro, you know, you know, you've been squatting for another
reason.

4575
04:44:02,910 --> 04:44:05,650
Like, that ass can, like, that ass got kicked.

4576
04:44:06,870 --> 04:44:07,270
Okay.

4577
04:44:10,630 --> 04:44:12,190
Oh, treats are work.

4578
04:44:13,830 --> 04:44:14,050
All right.

4579
04:44:14,370 --> 04:44:17,790
Oh, you ever noticed the Torrance vibe is like...

4580
04:44:17,790 --> 04:44:18,410
Rancid?

4581
04:44:18,890 --> 04:44:22,970
Between the dead fish in the harbor and the giant refinery,
it can't tell who's to blame.

4582
04:44:23,350 --> 04:44:25,050
Dang, that's some nasty shit.

4583
04:44:25,950 --> 04:44:28,330
Man, I love the smell of the refinery.

4584
04:44:28,830 --> 04:44:30,050
I hate the smell of gasoline.

4585
04:44:30,570 --> 04:44:31,630
I love the smell of gasoline.

4586
04:44:32,310 --> 04:44:33,570
Yeah, we going in.

4587
04:44:33,750 --> 04:44:35,990
We're clocking in for my nine to five.

4588
04:44:36,210 --> 04:44:37,370
Who pissed in your cereal?

4589
04:44:37,850 --> 04:44:39,850
Now that's some nasty shit.

4590
04:44:40,450 --> 04:44:43,730
Oh, let's do this.

4591
04:44:44,070 --> 04:44:46,270
All right, we sent Depression Man in first.

4592
04:44:46,930 --> 04:44:50,050
Torrance Middle School needs judges for our annual talent
show.

4593
04:44:50,550 --> 04:44:51,570
Do it for the kids.

4594
04:44:52,550 --> 04:44:54,110
Okay, I'm sitting prism in.

4595
04:44:54,250 --> 04:44:55,030
I can't trust you.

4596
04:44:55,170 --> 04:44:55,730
Actually, no.

4597
04:44:56,730 --> 04:44:58,510
We're going to find three slots.

4598
04:45:00,270 --> 04:45:03,070
So magnetic personality, Charlie.

4599
04:45:03,210 --> 04:45:03,470
Okay, hustle.

4600
04:45:05,170 --> 04:45:07,230
And it's good with kids.

4601
04:45:07,770 --> 04:45:10,330
I think Charlie can handle it.

4602
04:45:10,590 --> 04:45:12,410
He doesn't need anything else.

4603
04:45:12,430 --> 04:45:17,570
Do you ever feel like you had so much potential and you're
being wasted as a cog in a corporate machine?

4604
04:45:18,090 --> 04:45:20,890
Do not send crypto, bro, in.

4605
04:45:22,250 --> 04:45:23,670
I'm going to teach the kids crypto.

4606
04:45:24,190 --> 04:45:26,290
I'm going to trap after a tunnel collapse at the new
station.

4607
04:45:26,730 --> 04:45:27,670
Get them out safely.

4608
04:45:28,030 --> 04:45:28,890
All right, this is it.

4609
04:45:29,090 --> 04:45:29,490
Discreetly.

4610
04:45:29,550 --> 04:45:30,030
There we go.

4611
04:45:30,190 --> 04:45:30,790
Depression man.

4612
04:45:31,310 --> 04:45:32,150
No problemo.

4613
04:45:32,930 --> 04:45:33,550
There you go.

4614
04:45:34,490 --> 04:45:35,110
I believe.

4615
04:45:35,330 --> 04:45:37,110
Is this man familiar with ethical?

4616
04:45:37,150 --> 04:45:37,970
All right, there we go.

4617
04:45:38,070 --> 04:45:38,310
There you go.

4618
04:45:38,330 --> 04:45:38,950
Depression man.

4619
04:45:38,990 --> 04:45:39,870
He's going to do it.

4620
04:45:40,590 --> 04:45:44,030
I think Charlie is very good with kids.

4621
04:45:44,810 --> 04:45:46,210
He's a business genius.

4622
04:45:46,710 --> 04:45:48,490
Everything he does is brilliant.

4623
04:45:48,910 --> 04:45:49,490
There you go.

4624
04:45:49,530 --> 04:45:49,530
See?

4625
04:45:49,790 --> 04:45:50,430
Let's go!

4626
04:45:51,110 --> 04:45:53,110
The kids know crypto now.

4627
04:45:53,550 --> 04:45:56,230
Jesus, kid.

4628
04:45:57,050 --> 04:45:57,790
Let's go.

4629
04:45:59,270 --> 04:46:02,470
Isn't this like the third time one of his projects has
fallen apart?

4630
04:46:02,610 --> 04:46:04,090
But speed is key.

4631
04:46:04,870 --> 04:46:05,270
Oh, okay.

4632
04:46:05,510 --> 04:46:07,050
We have more like...

4633
04:46:07,050 --> 04:46:08,970
We're literally maxed out on speed.

4634
04:46:09,050 --> 04:46:09,810
There's no way.

4635
04:46:10,710 --> 04:46:12,450
Yeah, I was gonna say, we're 10.

4636
04:46:13,750 --> 04:46:15,810
Too bad there's no Grammy for this.

4637
04:46:16,110 --> 04:46:16,910
You monster.

4638
04:46:22,960 --> 04:46:23,840
Oh, it's this.

4639
04:46:24,480 --> 04:46:27,860
The parents started fighting over the results, and then the
kids joined in too.

4640
04:46:28,100 --> 04:46:31,020
Convince them non-violently, please.

4641
04:46:31,400 --> 04:46:31,620
Okay.

4642
04:46:32,560 --> 04:46:34,480
Oh, no, I don't have charisma.

4643
04:46:34,600 --> 04:46:34,820
Okay.

4644
04:46:35,340 --> 04:46:36,700
I can wait a little bit.

4645
04:46:36,820 --> 04:46:37,420
They're resting.

4646
04:46:38,740 --> 04:46:39,320
It's fine.

4647
04:46:40,120 --> 04:46:40,560
What's this?

4648
04:46:42,340 --> 04:46:51,240

Training time.

4652
04:47:10,680 --> 04:47:11,540
Oh, send it.

4653
04:47:11,560 --> 04:47:12,000
That's true.

4654
04:47:12,120 --> 04:47:12,880
It's training time.

4655
04:47:13,080 --> 04:47:14,140
If anyone's up for it.

4656
04:47:16,500 --> 04:47:17,460
Yeah, but he doesn't.

4657
04:47:17,560 --> 04:47:19,060
What if he doesn't show up?

4658
04:47:21,340 --> 04:47:23,620
Guys, what if he doesn't show up?

4659
04:47:27,620 --> 04:47:28,140
Yeah.

4660
04:47:28,880 --> 04:47:30,400
I got a coupon for a free.

4661
04:47:30,400 --> 04:47:31,440
All right, I'm sending it.

4662
04:47:31,500 --> 04:47:34,440
But if he doesn't show up for the kids, I swear to God.

4663
04:47:34,820 --> 04:47:36,240
So don't tell her nothing.

4664
04:47:37,060 --> 04:47:38,640
I remember my first talent show.

4665
04:47:38,640 --> 04:47:41,340
creates a slot exclusively for him to join.

4666
04:47:41,560 --> 04:47:42,880
I'm gonna ask you about Lizzie Galupo.

4667
04:47:43,120 --> 04:47:43,880
Second place.

4668
04:47:44,640 --> 04:47:45,060
Impossible.

4669
04:47:46,040 --> 04:47:47,820
I'm gonna stop, call, okay, we'll do that.

4670
04:47:48,040 --> 04:47:48,580
I got her back though.

4671
04:47:49,100 --> 04:47:52,000
I shot a laser beam and burned all that hair off.

4672
04:47:52,640 --> 04:47:55,320
So, I guess you're the real winner then?

4673
04:47:55,520 --> 04:47:56,240
Sure am.

4674
04:47:56,560 --> 04:47:58,880
Inspired my- Oh wait, tell them about- oh wait, there you
go.

4675
04:47:59,580 --> 04:48:00,240
Oh my god, it worked.

4676
04:48:00,860 --> 04:48:02,080
Sounds like a real bop.

4677
04:48:03,000 --> 04:48:04,660
Never say bop again.

4678
04:48:04,800 --> 04:48:05,520
Look at that, see?

4679
04:48:05,640 --> 04:48:06,900
Not so depressing now.

4680
04:48:07,140 --> 04:48:07,740
Is it?

4681
04:48:08,240 --> 04:48:08,620
Look at that.

4682
04:48:09,680 --> 04:48:11,360
Can't be that bad.

4683
04:48:12,400 --> 04:48:17,820
I, dear Drazy, yes, that dear Drazy, need help make him
disappear.

4684
04:48:18,540 --> 04:48:20,680
Oh my gosh, I don't have smart people in my team.

4685
04:48:20,840 --> 04:48:21,520
I don't know why.

4686
04:48:22,140 --> 04:48:24,880
I think I only have one person in my team that's smart.

4687
04:48:25,340 --> 04:48:26,760
Oh, this is so bad.

4688
04:48:33,590 --> 04:48:34,810
Are you fucking?

4689
04:48:34,910 --> 04:48:35,390
Okay, thank God.

4690
04:48:35,650 --> 04:48:35,690
Okay.

4691
04:48:36,030 --> 04:48:36,230
Okay.

4692
04:48:36,390 --> 04:48:36,530
Thank God.

4693
04:48:36,650 --> 04:48:36,830
Okay.

4694
04:48:38,030 --> 04:48:39,850
I wonder why.

4695
04:48:41,310 --> 04:48:44,750
Why did I go all in on the Harvard graduate?

4696
04:48:46,770 --> 04:48:48,090
Is anyone smart?

4697
04:48:49,110 --> 04:48:50,370
Three, three, three.

4698
04:48:51,530 --> 04:48:52,430
Okay, maybe.

4699
04:48:53,230 --> 04:48:55,030
Okay, we're sending in.

4700
04:48:55,250 --> 04:48:56,550
I'm sure to increase this.

4701
04:48:56,850 --> 04:48:59,030
I'm going to increase her intellect.

4702
04:48:59,350 --> 04:49:00,310
And then I'm going to fix her.

4703
04:49:00,430 --> 04:49:03,010
Florence Middle School is hosting an anti-bullying seminar.

4704
04:49:03,230 --> 04:49:04,650
And it would mean a lot.

4705
04:49:04,830 --> 04:49:05,450
Oh, my God.

4706
04:49:05,670 --> 04:49:06,450
Why are they...

4707
04:49:06,450 --> 04:49:08,970
The students and their parents.

4708
04:49:11,330 --> 04:49:12,290
Don't matter.

4709
04:49:12,370 --> 04:49:12,850
Okay.

4710
04:49:13,170 --> 04:49:15,770
Together, the two of us will be unstoppable.

4711
04:49:16,010 --> 04:49:16,590
Okay, it's fine.

4712
04:49:16,690 --> 04:49:17,530
I bet you say that to everybody.

4713
04:49:19,470 --> 04:49:19,890
It's fine.

4714
04:49:20,030 --> 04:49:21,070
I'm gonna...

4715
04:49:22,030 --> 04:49:23,450
I'm gonna give coffee.

4716
04:49:23,830 --> 04:49:24,250
Feeling fresh.

4717
04:49:24,530 --> 04:49:26,550
Her, and then...

4718
04:49:27,310 --> 04:49:27,790
Um...

4719
04:49:32,420 --> 04:49:33,500
I think this will work.

4720
04:49:33,580 --> 04:49:34,060
You know what?

4721
04:49:34,440 --> 04:49:35,480
Perfect as always.

4722
04:49:36,000 --> 04:49:36,880
Let's put them together.

4723
04:49:37,860 --> 04:49:39,080
I'm on my way.

4724
04:49:39,180 --> 04:49:41,060
I know, like, maybe he'll...

4725
04:49:41,060 --> 04:49:44,500
Man back with Sona's gonna scare people, but that's okay.

4726
04:49:44,640 --> 04:49:46,020
You miss a rabies shot or something?

4727
04:49:46,500 --> 04:49:47,500
Power was out at my place.

4728
04:49:47,820 --> 04:49:49,500
Couldn't even check up on my investments.

4729
04:49:49,700 --> 04:49:52,400
Oh no, the numbers that go up and down every day.

4730
04:49:52,980 --> 04:49:53,700
You'll be fine.

4731
04:49:55,220 --> 04:49:56,500
Survey restraining order.

4732
04:49:57,700 --> 04:49:59,880
Okay, do you think I can delete all the files in time?

4733
04:50:01,800 --> 04:50:03,320
I think I can do it.

4734
04:50:03,740 --> 04:50:05,700
I doubt Deidre is the only victim of this.

4735
04:50:06,040 --> 04:50:08,260
Let's delete all the files on his laptop.

4736
04:50:08,420 --> 04:50:09,340
I believe in myself.

4737
04:50:10,180 --> 04:50:11,280
Get the backups too.

4738
04:50:11,520 --> 04:50:12,440
And the backups too.

4739
04:50:15,340 --> 04:50:16,100

Oh, my God.

4746
04:50:53,600 --> 04:50:54,960
Oh, my God.

4747
04:50:58,700 --> 04:51:00,100
Oh, my God.

4748
04:51:00,120 --> 04:51:01,160
Okay, okay, okay, it's fine.

04:51:21,470 --> 04:51:24,030
Left, left, left, left, left, left, left, left, left.

04:51:55,380 --> 04:51:56,480
Guys, guys, what was it?

4758
04:51:58,960 --> 04:52:01,060
Right, right, right, left.

4759
04:52:01,960 --> 04:52:02,780
Right, right, left.

4760
04:52:03,280 --> 04:52:03,640
No!

4761
04:52:04,160 --> 04:52:04,520
No!

4762
04:52:04,520 --> 04:52:04,780
Right, right, left,

4763
04:52:08,750 --> 04:52:08,750
left.

4764
04:52:10,590 --> 04:52:11,090
Okay, there you go.

4765
04:52:11,450 --> 04:52:11,630
There you go.

4766
04:52:11,790 --> 04:52:11,930
There you go.

4767
04:52:12,090 --> 04:52:12,150
There you go.

4768
04:52:12,430 --> 04:52:12,550
There you go.

4769
04:52:12,710 --> 04:52:12,910
There you go.

4770
04:52:13,370 --> 04:52:15,410
There you go.

4771
04:52:16,730 --> 04:52:18,570
I was panicking, I was panicking, I was panicking.

4772
04:52:19,070 --> 04:52:23,290
I was panicking.

4773
04:52:23,430 --> 04:52:23,530
Yay!

4774
04:52:26,090 --> 04:52:27,750
Was this that hard?

4775
04:52:28,310 --> 04:52:29,790
Jesus, I deleted it all from the cloud.

4776
04:52:30,250 --> 04:52:31,270
Wasn't even that hard.

4777
04:52:31,390 --> 04:52:32,630
Oh my god.

4778
04:52:33,150 --> 04:52:35,130
Oh, that was close.

4779
04:52:36,470 --> 04:52:38,750
My might is your might.

4780
04:52:39,110 --> 04:52:39,810
So easy.

4781
04:52:40,130 --> 04:52:42,290
The set needs a background actor for an upcoming scene.

4782
04:52:42,470 --> 04:52:43,910
The last one stormed off in a hurry.

4783
04:52:44,870 --> 04:52:46,710
Break a leg, but not like that.

You look great.

4793
04:53:50,710 --> 04:53:51,690
Roberts is bullying me.

4794
04:53:51,990 --> 04:53:53,170
Please ask him to stop.

4795
04:53:53,290 --> 04:53:54,650

All right, 97.

4798
04:54:02,830 --> 04:54:03,050
Nice.

4799
04:54:03,590 --> 04:54:07,910
We saved the beach Hope this makes it a little easier.

4800
04:54:08,950 --> 04:54:11,990
Yay Beach has been saved.

4801
04:54:13,170 --> 04:54:20,150
All right, I'm gonna put more intelligence onto my people
Like I we can't rely on Charlie.

4802
04:54:20,710 --> 04:54:29,390
What I found out was relying on Charlie on all the IQ tests
Might be specific type of hero for my upcoming.

4803
04:54:29,650 --> 04:54:32,970
Oh, a mysterious send someone unassumably strong.

4804
04:54:33,550 --> 04:54:40,750
Oh um Oh Man That's okay.

4805
04:54:40,930 --> 04:54:44,790
Give me a sec Maybe golem I think golem

4806
04:54:48,110 --> 04:54:48,710
He's...

4807
04:54:48,710 --> 04:54:52,310
Yeah, but he's not that strong, guys.

4808
04:54:52,590 --> 04:54:54,050
He has a three.

4809
04:54:55,210 --> 04:54:56,650
Oh, okay, that's fine.

4810
04:54:57,330 --> 04:55:02,310
My rejected TEDx San Antonio talk will finally get the
recognition it deserves.

4811
04:55:03,530 --> 04:55:07,790
Sometimes reaching a certain point will have an effect like
this one, which will guarantee a fail.

4812
04:55:08,330 --> 04:55:08,670
Yeah?

4813
04:55:09,110 --> 04:55:11,430
Your team will fail this scenario?

4814
04:55:12,550 --> 04:55:13,490
Wait, what?

4815
04:55:16,110 --> 04:55:16,710
Mysterious.

4816
04:55:16,730 --> 04:55:22,110
fire is broken out at the refinery we got it under control
but we can't investigate the cause with all these dangerous

4817
04:55:22,110 --> 04:55:34,910
fumes flambay i would never blow up a refinery okay they
smell like someone oh too much will fail oh okay so no

4818
04:55:34,910 --> 04:55:46,710
combat oh that's hard oh hell yes oh this is bad me really
okay

4819
04:55:49,890 --> 04:55:51,950
Oh, this is bad.

4820
04:55:57,150 --> 04:55:57,710
Um...

4821
04:56:04,550 --> 04:56:06,070
I'm your guy.

4822
04:56:08,350 --> 04:56:08,810
Oh, yeah.

4823
04:56:09,270 --> 04:56:10,890
Yeah, I've messed up.

4824
04:56:13,270 --> 04:56:15,050
I think if I send in...

4825
04:56:15,050 --> 04:56:18,910
Oh, I'm a little bit too combat-oriented.

4826
04:56:20,070 --> 04:56:22,330
I guess I send in my all-rounder.

4827
04:56:22,430 --> 04:56:23,550
I have to send in my all-rounder.

4828
04:56:23,570 --> 04:56:27,690
there oh we're done a good job though

4829
04:56:32,230 --> 04:56:45,630
do i send in do i send in golem or malvola we're not sending
phenomena man golem or melvona which is better all

4830
04:56:51,030 --> 04:56:59,050
right i'll send in golem buildings would randomly blow up yo
man warden the hallways oh golem in last i forgot about that

4831
04:56:59,050 --> 04:57:04,570
i forgot about golem in last lot look if you wanted to grab
dinner all you had to do is ask.

4832
04:57:04,790 --> 04:57:04,910
Are you?

4833
04:57:05,090 --> 04:57:06,070
Oh my no, no, no, no.

4834
04:57:06,210 --> 04:57:06,390
Oh god.

4835
04:57:06,570 --> 04:57:06,690
Oh god.

4836
04:57:07,030 --> 04:57:07,030
Okay.

4837
04:57:07,290 --> 04:57:08,170
You're not my type.

4838
04:57:08,350 --> 04:57:09,350
I forgot about the slot.

4839
04:57:09,850 --> 04:57:10,930
That's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.

4840
04:57:11,030 --> 04:57:11,230
That's okay.

4841
04:57:11,390 --> 04:57:12,850
I think Golem can solo this.

4842
04:57:15,550 --> 04:57:16,810
Alright, I don't learn my lesson.

4843
04:57:17,550 --> 04:57:18,790
I don't learn my lesson.

4844
04:57:18,990 --> 04:57:19,810
I keep putting him in.

4845
04:57:19,970 --> 04:57:22,510
Okay, we got... Okay, now we can't keep putting on combat.

4846
04:57:23,010 --> 04:57:23,010
Okay.

4847
04:57:24,890 --> 04:57:25,290
Mobility.

4848
04:57:25,290 --> 04:57:26,750
I think he's smart enough.

4849
04:57:36,250 --> 04:57:36,910
Alright, Golem.

4850
04:57:37,330 --> 04:57:40,370
I believe you got this.

4851
04:57:41,270 --> 04:57:42,610
Oh god.

4852
04:57:42,830 --> 04:57:44,570
Oh, oh, oh.

4853
04:57:45,710 --> 04:57:46,370
Oh.

4854
04:57:49,730 --> 04:57:49,910
Oh!

4855
04:57:56,390 --> 04:57:57,790
Something about this feels off.

4856
04:57:58,310 --> 04:57:59,650
We're so close.

4857
04:58:00,670 --> 04:58:01,990
That was so close.

4858
04:58:02,690 --> 04:58:04,070
He did not guide.

4859
04:58:07,010 --> 04:58:09,750
It was rigged from the start.

4860
04:58:12,050 --> 04:58:13,210
Oh my god.

4861
04:58:13,630 --> 04:58:20,430
like every time we see beef he gets food maybe he's got an
iron stomach do we know anybody like that super digestion

4868
04:58:59,530 --> 04:59:00,950
Yes, but it's just a coincidence.

04:59:01,170 --> 04:59:01,710
Oh, come on.

4870
04:59:01,850 --> 04:59:08,170

Shut up, Dad.

4884
04:59:28,470 --> 04:59:29,430
I never had a dad.

4885
04:59:29,810 --> 04:59:30,070
Aw.

4886
04:59:30,250 --> 04:59:30,470
I know.

4887
04:59:30,830 --> 04:59:31,890
Fuck that's supposed to me.

4888
04:59:32,190 --> 04:59:32,710
I mean...

4889
04:59:32,710 --> 04:59:34,350
Told me one time you didn't have a dad.

4890
04:59:35,470 --> 04:59:35,730
Huh.

4891
04:59:36,730 --> 04:59:38,410
I mean, it's sort of obvious a little.

4892
04:59:39,090 --> 04:59:41,010
She definitely looks like she has daddy issues.

4893
04:59:45,490 --> 04:59:51,850
heard the team scuffling with the red ring they run half the
crime in the county we were bound to bother them at some

4894
04:59:51,850 --> 04:59:58,270
point watch yourself you poke the hive you're gonna have to
fuck the queen that's not how bees work you know what i mean

4895
04:59:58,270 --> 05:00:09,490

taken man you would do that kill shroud yes you might get

4896
05:00:09,490 --> 05:00:13,950
the chance you don't want to go in there having to think
about it No hesitation.

4897
05:00:16,750 --> 05:00:18,090
Shroud killed him, Chase.

4898
05:00:18,730 --> 05:00:20,130
There's only one thing I can do.

4899
05:00:20,270 --> 05:00:21,010
You know that's not true.

4900
05:00:21,530 --> 05:00:23,270
I'm not sure your dad would want it that way.

4901
05:00:24,150 --> 05:00:24,890
You're not sure.

4902
05:00:25,450 --> 05:00:26,210
Should we ask him?

4903
05:00:26,550 --> 05:00:29,030
Should we ask a dead man that died to him?

4904
05:00:29,890 --> 05:00:31,050
I know Batman.

4905

05:00:35,510 --> 05:00:36,510
One patch at a time.

4907
05:00:37,270 --> 05:00:39,110
I mean, Roy's doing most of the work, though, right?

4908
05:00:39,470 --> 05:00:40,410
So much.

4909
05:00:42,670 --> 05:00:55,570
this shit yeah heroes do kill the good ones so maybe if we
maybe because we kept letting these villains go we keep

4910
05:00:55,570 --> 05:01:02,470
having so much crime folks welcome back we got a few guests
actually like leading one right now is blue balls man

4911
05:01:02,470 --> 05:01:11,070
actually like for this business model we shouldn't be
killing villains i understand let me we have to let just let

4912
05:01:11,070 --> 05:01:13,710
them go just so we we can have more subscribers.

4913
05:01:13,730 --> 05:01:15,870
Yes, his power is not being able to nut.

4914

No, his balls are literally blue, dude.

4915
05:01:18,250 --> 05:01:19,330

Why is Goldham sick?

4919
05:01:22,970 --> 05:01:25,330
Yeah, I'll be out of business if I keep killing villains.

4920
05:01:27,870 --> 05:01:29,030
Mr. Cat is all there.

4921
05:01:29,190 --> 05:01:29,610

So, please find my boy.

4923
05:01:32,670 --> 05:01:34,550

05:01:49,090 --> 05:01:49,730
What's the fuck?

4931
05:01:49,990 --> 05:01:50,330

someone tricked me about that Okay, I'm not timed, though,

4946
05:02:45,970 --> 05:02:46,610
which is good.

4947
05:02:47,450 --> 05:02:47,890
Wait, what?

Okay, I get it.

4951
05:02:57,030 --> 05:02:59,390
Okay, I'm, like, funneling energy back to people.

4952
05:03:03,810 --> 05:03:04,290
Okay.

4953
05:03:08,730 --> 05:03:09,990
Oh, I see.

4954
05:03:10,110 --> 05:03:11,630
Oh, this is smart.

4955
05:03:17,310 --> 05:03:19,170
Okay, I think I have to do this one.

4956
05:03:22,740 --> 05:03:37,640
okay and then I grab energy here I like this this is a neat
concept and then I funnel energy here and I grab energy here

4957
05:03:37,640 --> 05:03:39,680
mr.

4958
05:03:40,040 --> 05:03:50,000
hacker man and then bam there you yeah that's an easy one
yeah like how there's a lot of variety in these hacking

4959
05:03:50,000 --> 05:03:55,680
games yeah that's a I've lost contact with the tower and
it's pitch black out here.

4960
05:03:55,860 --> 05:04:02,860
I cannot land this thing help Oh don't worry, it's the plane
on the ground Sounds dangerous.

4961
05:04:03,040 --> 05:04:09,320
I got flyers Oh Oh, never mind.

4962
05:04:09,440 --> 05:04:10,640

4964
05:04:30,040 --> 05:04:37,800
a hell of a deal it's fine we don't need flyers they cannot
fly and yet they attempt to oh there was a choice it's fine

4965
05:04:37,800 --> 05:04:45,400
flying fucking slaps can you blame them for trying but their
feeble bodies were meant for gentler activities such as

4966
05:04:45,400 --> 05:04:51,540
walking and I knew it there you go open portal yeah exactly
I told you guys.

4967
05:04:52,300 --> 05:04:53,000
The danger.

4968
05:04:53,720 --> 05:04:55,040
I don't need no flyers.

4969
05:04:55,220 --> 05:04:59,520
I suppose their futile efforts to become more than they are
is admirable.

4970
05:05:01,400 --> 05:05:02,880
Okay, my mother lives in the senior community.

4971
05:05:02,960 --> 05:05:04,180
She hasn't answered the phone.

4972
05:05:04,640 --> 05:05:05,120
Go door.

4973
05:05:05,820 --> 05:05:08,160
Be prepared to provide medical assistance.

4974
05:05:08,820 --> 05:05:10,300

4975
05:05:10,400 --> 05:05:10,980
Wait, okay.

I don't know.

4979
05:05:15,020 --> 05:05:15,680
I'll think about it.

4980
05:05:15,780 --> 05:05:16,560
Actually, I think...

4981
05:05:16,560 --> 05:05:18,180
My mother lives in the Parkwood senior community.

4982
05:05:18,620 --> 05:05:19,920
And she hasn't answered her phone.

4983
05:05:20,500 --> 05:05:21,540

Yeah, I know the elderly love you.

4986
05:05:26,120 --> 05:05:26,820
Your depression.

4987
05:05:27,460 --> 05:05:29,020
They see you and they'll be less depressed.

4988
05:05:29,240 --> 05:05:30,140
Can you lend a hand?

4989
05:05:30,640 --> 05:05:31,260
Preferably a strong one.

4990
05:05:31,300 --> 05:05:33,140
Any delays will cause another explosion?

4991
05:05:33,860 --> 05:05:34,720
Oh, shit.

4992
05:05:35,820 --> 05:05:36,860

Hello.

Okay, we're gonna rest a little bit.

5002
05:06:04,660 --> 05:06:07,540
Don't worry, we have time to figure this out.

5003
05:06:09,560 --> 05:06:12,180
Oh my god, what the fuck do I do?

Nice.

5021
05:07:05,950 --> 05:07:06,670
I knew it.

5022
05:07:06,910 --> 05:07:08,930
I've always believed...

5023
05:07:09,490 --> 05:07:09,970
Okay.

5024
05:07:11,470 --> 05:07:13,650

5028
05:07:19,790 --> 05:07:20,030
What?

5029
05:07:20,550 --> 05:07:21,450
Would you care to keep it?

5030
05:07:22,930 --> 05:07:23,810
Oh, shit.

Let's go.

5033
05:07:25,150 --> 05:07:26,570
I don't need to keep a secret.

5034
05:07:27,530 --> 05:07:27,730
Alright.

5035
05:07:28,550 --> 05:07:31,930
Strangely, that's not the first time I've heard that.

5036
05:07:34,610 --> 05:07:37,430
Alright, at least the hacking is not timed this time, for
real.

5037
05:07:39,710 --> 05:07:41,650
I think I used my brain.

5038
05:07:43,610 --> 05:07:44,610
Alright, here.

5039
05:07:45,330 --> 05:07:47,050

There you go.

5053
05:08:16,270 --> 05:08:16,690
Easy!

5054
05:08:18,410 --> 05:08:19,930
God, I'm such a good hacker, man.

5055
05:08:21,410 --> 05:08:22,570
No, you killed him.

5056
05:08:22,570 --> 05:08:24,970
and you're just the same villain being Satan and medieval.

5057
05:08:25,370 --> 05:08:26,830
Thank you for the super chat.

Vandals are defacing the Torrance Library mural.

Oh I'm so sad

5080
05:10:07,530 --> 05:10:12,430
Oh That's awkward.

5081
05:10:13,150 --> 05:10:14,570
Oh, that's so awkward.

5082
05:10:19,650 --> 05:10:21,450
I Will grab charisma.

5083
05:10:21,830 --> 05:10:30,310
I don't think we need more right now we can grab charisma
and then We'll also grab charisma here too.

5084
05:10:30,790 --> 05:10:33,730
We've got a situation that Ben labs.

5085
05:10:34,170 --> 05:10:35,470
They told me to call SDN.

5086
05:10:35,750 --> 05:10:36,510
I'm just an intern.

5087
05:10:39,430 --> 05:10:39,690
Oh.

5088
05:10:41,930 --> 05:10:42,530
Oh.

5089
05:10:44,470 --> 05:10:46,910
Bro, my all of them are so strong.

5090
05:10:47,930 --> 05:10:50,070
They're all I must excuse myself.

5091
05:10:50,090 --> 05:10:51,410
You're depressed again?

5092
05:10:52,110 --> 05:10:52,490
Again.

5093
05:10:54,170 --> 05:10:57,030
Okay, who's the least strongest?

5094
05:10:57,530 --> 05:10:58,510
I guess Golem?

5095
05:10:59,890 --> 05:11:02,470
I think Golem is the only one I could do.

5096
05:11:04,630 --> 05:11:06,290
Okay, we're gonna have to do Golem.

5097
05:11:07,070 --> 05:11:07,970
I'm heading downtown.

5098
05:11:08,390 --> 05:11:09,330
See you can use some help.

05:11:09,770 --> 05:11:10,590
Feel free to send someone.

5100
05:11:13,170 --> 05:11:14,110
I work better alone.

5101
05:11:14,990 --> 05:11:17,310

There we go.

There's no way I need any intellect for this.

5125
05:13:51,420 --> 05:13:52,320
There's no way.

5126
05:13:52,480 --> 05:13:54,240
Can I at least keep the guys responsible?

5127
05:13:54,900 --> 05:13:55,740
There's no way.

5128
05:13:57,360 --> 05:13:59,600
There's no way I need any brains for this.

5129
05:13:59,860 --> 05:14:00,780
I swear to God.

5130
05:14:00,880 --> 05:14:01,400
Oh, God.

5131
05:14:01,680 --> 05:14:02,080
Come on.

5132
05:14:02,260 --> 05:14:02,740

5134
05:14:05,540 --> 05:14:05,820
I'm sorry.

5135
05:14:05,880 --> 05:14:07,100
It was fucking depressed.

5136
05:14:07,200 --> 05:14:08,160
I'm fighting him.

5137
05:14:08,280 --> 05:14:08,400
I have 10.

5138
05:14:08,400 --> 05:14:09,320
You don't even need to say it.

5139
05:14:09,740 --> 05:14:10,840
Fuck these guys up.

5140
05:14:12,740 --> 05:14:13,660
There's no way.

5141
05:14:13,700 --> 05:14:14,460
I was gonna say it.

5142
05:14:14,500 --> 05:14:15,280
I have 10.

5143
05:14:17,080 --> 05:14:18,660
I went all in on combat.

5144
05:14:26,230 --> 05:14:27,970
Yeah, I'm making you an all-rounder.

5145
05:14:30,670 --> 05:14:33,810
I have too many stupid people on my team.

5146
05:14:34,310 --> 05:14:38,290
I can't rely all on him because sometimes he changes to a
dumb guy.

5147
05:14:40,690 --> 05:14:41,310
Search and rescue.

5148
05:14:41,350 --> 05:14:43,090
I don't know what search and rescue would be.

5149
05:14:43,390 --> 05:14:44,170
That's the thing.

5150
05:14:48,010 --> 05:14:49,010
Okay, thank God.

5151
05:14:49,770 --> 05:14:50,370
10, 10, 10.

5152
05:14:51,510 --> 05:14:53,050
You sure we don't work on commission?

5153
05:14:54,590 --> 05:14:55,430
Wait for a man?

5154
05:14:56,590 --> 05:14:58,250
Everybody should step back.

5155
05:14:59,250 --> 05:15:00,510
She's slowly returning.

5156
05:15:00,930 --> 05:15:02,230
Oh, there's so many people.

5157
05:15:02,450 --> 05:15:04,250
My daughter was at the beach with her friends.

5158
05:15:04,470 --> 05:15:05,630
And I haven't heard from her.

5159
05:15:05,730 --> 05:15:06,850
I'm really worried.

5160
05:15:08,710 --> 05:15:09,190
Uh...

5161
05:15:11,590 --> 05:15:12,490
We'll do him.

5162
05:15:12,650 --> 05:15:14,750
You are quite an intimidating specimen.

5163
05:15:14,770 --> 05:15:15,310
Oh, God, okay.

5164
05:15:15,330 --> 05:15:17,710
On the outside, sob to the inside.

5165
05:15:18,010 --> 05:15:21,230
I believe that is how all life forms are.

5166
05:15:21,330 --> 05:15:23,030
Yeah, I meant like metaphorical.

5167
05:15:23,030 --> 05:15:24,250
I messed up.

5168
05:15:24,250 --> 05:15:25,490
A metaphorical dog.

5169
05:15:26,310 --> 05:15:26,570
Where?

5170
05:15:29,330 --> 05:15:30,410
Fresh as a daisy.

5171
05:15:35,530 --> 05:15:37,510
You don't need to see shit to punch shit.

5172
05:15:39,350 --> 05:15:40,550
Oh, yo.

5173
05:15:42,870 --> 05:15:43,770
It's fine.

5174
05:15:44,570 --> 05:15:45,350
Everything's fine.

5175
05:15:46,490 --> 05:15:46,950
It's fine.

5176
05:15:46,990 --> 05:15:48,670
I'm putting more intelligence in here.

5177
05:15:49,070 --> 05:15:50,790
I need more smart people on my team.

5178
05:15:52,330 --> 05:15:52,910
It's fine.

5179
05:15:57,670 --> 05:15:59,030
I have time.

5180
05:16:00,250 --> 05:16:02,690
I can get Prism in here.

5181
05:16:05,210 --> 05:16:05,670
Yeah!

5182
05:16:06,110 --> 05:16:06,310
Okay.

5183
05:16:07,390 --> 05:16:08,050
Hey girl.

5184
05:16:09,150 --> 05:16:10,110
And we have synergy too.

5185
05:16:10,230 --> 05:16:12,110
I think this shift gave me carpal tunnel.

5186
05:16:12,350 --> 05:16:12,890
See, look at that.

5187
05:16:13,610 --> 05:16:13,950
Oh, okay.

5188
05:16:15,130 --> 05:16:16,170
Where should we search guys?

5189
05:16:16,190 --> 05:16:17,410
Probably a combo type deal.

5190
05:16:21,110 --> 05:16:37,460
search the pier beach or what oh yeah thank god he's normal
too water no sign of them where else should we go beach oh

5191
05:16:39,210 --> 05:16:54,080

fucking kidding oh he's she's dead she's dead

5192
05:16:58,000 --> 05:16:59,380
No, she's dead.

5193
05:17:00,140 --> 05:17:00,700
We are not.

5194
05:17:04,280 --> 05:17:05,320
Um, we...

5195
05:17:05,320 --> 05:17:06,560
I did not know!

5196
05:17:08,520 --> 05:17:09,640
Oh, yeah, no.

5197
05:17:09,820 --> 05:17:10,300
No, we're not.

5198
05:17:10,780 --> 05:17:12,160
She's not coming back.

5199
05:17:14,460 --> 05:17:15,720
How is I supposed to know?

5200
05:17:16,140 --> 05:17:17,060
You need intelligence.

5201
05:17:17,300 --> 05:17:19,320
I thought we were searching someone.

5202
05:17:23,890 --> 05:17:24,530
Be cool.

5203
05:17:25,010 --> 05:17:25,470
Be cool.

5204
05:17:25,590 --> 05:17:26,270
Don't do drugs.

5205
05:17:26,350 --> 05:17:27,010
Go to school.

5206
05:17:28,490 --> 05:17:41,930
school kids oh my god i could be wrong i fear the teenagers
were mocking me uh well you're not exactly cool man

No, teenagers are really mean people No, I get it I I get it

5210
05:18:20,650 --> 05:18:35,170
Why no more combat I'm calling Nothing is up combat Imagine
more combat Kids are cruel.

5211
05:18:35,510 --> 05:18:36,570
They're so mean.

5212
05:18:37,390 --> 05:18:38,250
It's working.

5213
05:18:41,910 --> 05:18:43,850
Bringing a heal back from down.

5214
05:18:44,050 --> 05:18:44,410
Oh, nice.

5215
05:18:44,710 --> 05:18:48,690
Wait, they never really... Oh, I guess I can bring him back
from depression.

5216
05:18:50,730 --> 05:18:50,930
Charisma.

5217
05:18:51,790 --> 05:18:52,990
Who needs more charisma?

5218
05:18:59,640 --> 05:19:00,140
Maybe...

5219
05:19:01,560 --> 05:19:02,260
That's right.

5220
05:19:02,440 --> 05:19:03,180
More charisma.

5221
05:19:11,710 --> 05:19:12,370
Let's go in 13.

5222
05:19:12,850 --> 05:19:13,830
Anyone but sonar.

5223
05:19:14,050 --> 05:19:14,870
I'll go give it to sonar.

5224
05:19:16,150 --> 05:19:17,650
Good week, everybody.

5225
05:19:18,250 --> 05:19:18,910
See you all on Monday.

5226
05:19:25,090 --> 05:19:28,550
I mean, the sardines of Villambar, not sure I'd fit in.

5227
05:19:28,590 --> 05:19:29,770
Just go dress like that.

5228
05:19:30,170 --> 05:19:31,990
Everyone will just think you're a pervert.

5229
05:19:33,290 --> 05:19:33,550
What?

5230
05:19:34,630 --> 05:19:35,070
Yeah.

5231
05:19:37,630 --> 05:19:38,050
All right.

5232
05:19:44,580 --> 05:19:46,200
Oh, we're hitting it with the boys.

5233
05:19:47,220 --> 05:19:48,080
Let's go.

5234
05:19:49,200 --> 05:19:49,600
Oh.

5235
05:19:49,620 --> 05:19:54,560
Oh, this looks like a very non-villain bot.

5236
05:19:54,700 --> 05:19:56,140
Oh, look, he has his airpods on.

5237
05:19:56,460 --> 05:19:56,800
Damn big.

5238
05:19:57,100 --> 05:19:57,260
Oh.

5239
05:19:57,260 --> 05:19:57,720
You want to drink?

5240
05:19:57,960 --> 05:19:58,440
Sure.

5241
05:20:02,920 --> 05:20:04,560
Oh, that sucks, man.

5242
05:20:04,860 --> 05:20:05,980
Hey, creep.

5243
05:20:06,760 --> 05:20:07,100
Creep.

5244
05:20:07,600 --> 05:20:10,620
I don't know you, and I don't like not knowing people.

5245
05:20:10,740 --> 05:20:12,740
Well, you won't like knowing him.

5246
05:20:13,340 --> 05:20:15,160
He's the biggest perv west of the LA River.

5247
05:20:15,860 --> 05:20:17,320
And he's with us?

5248
05:20:19,720 --> 05:20:20,540
She's joking.

5249
05:20:20,700 --> 05:20:29,020
I'm not my business, but if you do go jerking off in the
bathroom, you make it my business That's um, I don't want to

5250
05:20:29,020 --> 05:20:33,780
be in that business Wait, this is a villain bar?

5251
05:20:35,080 --> 05:20:38,020
How the fuck are we the villain bar after being heroes?

5252
05:20:40,480 --> 05:20:41,720
Is there no hero bar?

5253
05:20:41,980 --> 05:20:47,100
No, there is a hero bar I guess it'd be cheaper too.

5254
05:20:47,940 --> 05:20:50,060
I feel like also that's so Stupid.

5255
05:20:50,200 --> 05:20:51,780
Why the fuck are they so...

5256
05:20:52,240 --> 05:20:53,740
Can they not just get arrested?

5257
05:20:54,500 --> 05:20:54,860
Like...

5258
05:20:54,860 --> 05:20:57,920
I guess they need a warrant to be in the villain bar.

5259
05:21:03,610 --> 05:21:04,470
Buy me a drink.

5260
05:21:05,610 --> 05:21:05,990

5261
05:21:06,350 --> 05:21:07,370
No, but my...

5262
05:21:07,370 --> 05:21:09,030
But they don't know my secret identity.

5263
05:21:09,610 --> 05:21:10,510
I got my Sour Patch kids on our first date.

5264
05:21:10,690 --> 05:21:12,510

5265
05:21:12,890 --> 05:21:13,990

5271
05:21:19,710 --> 05:21:20,410

05:21:55,670 --> 05:21:57,190

5278
05:21:57,330 --> 05:22:00,190

energy.

5283
05:22:06,550 --> 05:22:08,470
You were the bad guy until...

5284
05:22:08,470 --> 05:22:10,170
Wait, when did we decide you wasn't the bad guy?

5285
05:22:10,210 --> 05:22:11,210
Yeah, when did we decide that?

5286
05:22:14,890 --> 05:22:15,690

5287
05:22:17,950 --> 05:22:18,510

Bitch, you blind forever.

5290
05:22:22,630 --> 05:22:30,850
I'm thankful that our breakup has given me time to learn
about myself unfortunately what I've learned is that I hate

Oh, shit.

5296
05:23:35,920 --> 05:23:36,800
Everyone thinks I'm a narc.

5297
05:23:37,960 --> 05:23:39,680
They can still smell the hero on you.

5298
05:23:40,180 --> 05:23:40,660
You're the enemy.

5299
05:23:40,840 --> 05:23:42,220
What about depression then?

5300
05:23:42,320 --> 05:23:43,000
What else do they want?

5301
05:23:43,820 --> 05:23:44,800
You can buy him drinks.

5302
05:23:45,280 --> 05:23:46,980
You can make sure they don't get fired.

5303
05:23:47,700 --> 05:23:52,200
You can line him up and blow him one by one, but they're
still gonna think you might be the hero that fucked up their

5304
05:23:52,200 --> 05:23:52,700
life.

5305
05:23:53,580 --> 05:23:55,780
People don't think about much when I blow him.

5306
05:23:57,060 --> 05:23:58,320
But I hear what you're saying.

5307
05:23:59,200 --> 05:24:07,040
argue they fucked up their own lives being criminals see
that snark shit just tell him he's a loser any of them

5308
05:24:07,040 --> 05:24:11,540
anyway he's a loser so it's fine bro

5309
05:24:34,330 --> 05:24:42,350
I must have died during this fight if he's having PTSD I'm

5310
05:24:51,400 --> 05:24:52,540

5311
05:25:02,650 --> 05:25:16,990

05:25:33,790 --> 05:25:37,510
Oh shit, oh Oh,

5313
05:25:41,830 --> 05:25:43,410
I didn't even notice that

5314
05:25:47,670 --> 05:25:58,530
I have no leaves And I need it OP And it doesn't even
function anyway Cause I have your actual dysfunction It's so

5315
05:25:58,530 --> 05:26:04,190
catchy guys I thought they lost it working in a deli or
something And there was this incident in crypto Where he was

5316
05:26:04,190 --> 05:26:11,390
fucking with me And I kind of I've been dealing with that
wistly ass tooth Cause of you Well it was self-inflicted But

5317
05:26:11,390 --> 05:26:19,190
I'm not sure he'll see it that way So you can see Why I'm
worried about getting in That's how catchy it is.

5318
05:26:19,230 --> 05:26:20,630
Oh, yeah, because he doesn't know.

5319
05:26:20,710 --> 05:26:22,190
He doesn't know you get it over with.

5320
05:26:22,250 --> 05:26:23,170
He doesn't know it's met the man.

5321
05:26:23,190 --> 05:26:23,850
Sooner we get a fresh start.

5322
05:26:24,650 --> 05:26:26,550
You heard me when I said incinerated, right?

5323
05:26:26,770 --> 05:26:29,850
Who let a loser ass bitch of a hero into our supervillain
bar?

5324
05:26:30,930 --> 05:26:32,150
Why is everyone?

5325
05:26:33,190 --> 05:26:34,230
Do I look like a bitch?

5326
05:26:34,870 --> 05:26:35,990
Don't answer that.

5327
05:26:37,450 --> 05:26:37,950
Is he big?

5328
05:26:38,270 --> 05:26:39,670
He's got big guy voice.

5329
05:26:40,150 --> 05:26:41,550
Some parts of him are big.

5330
05:26:41,910 --> 05:26:44,610
All right, from now on, team drinks are exclusively at
Chili's.

5331
05:26:44,850 --> 05:26:46,210
Are you lost or something, bitch?

5332
05:26:46,210 --> 05:26:48,190
Or you're trying to get fucked up.

5333
05:26:48,190 --> 05:26:49,310
What happened to his arms?

5334
05:26:49,610 --> 05:26:49,970
Why is it?

5335
05:26:49,990 --> 05:26:51,250

05:26:57,650 --> 05:26:59,070
No one's talking to you, fucking you.

5340
05:27:00,630 --> 05:27:04,170
I see they finally gave you some arms that can reach your
dick.

5341
05:27:05,990 --> 05:27:08,510
There's some people that want to talk to you, if it's a
bitch.

5342
05:27:09,870 --> 05:27:10,770
That's a good one.

instinct.

Well, I have a third monitor, but I'm going to go install my
third monitor after this stream.

Doki, you're an itch, and your name is Robert.

I knew you wouldn't make the correct choices to piss off
everyone in chat.

5482
05:37:23,990 --> 05:37:27,050
You are the best donkey to ever punish.

5486
05:37:31,490 --> 05:37:34,270
These were the choices that vibe with me the most.

5487
05:37:34,710 --> 05:37:37,990
I thought they were great choices, guys.

5488
05:37:38,450 --> 05:37:41,330
I thought they were wonderful picks.

Thank you.

5495
05:38:15,290 --> 05:38:21,650
With huge voter turnout in the chat, we should petition for
a phenomenon sonar romance path as downloadable content full

5496
05:38:21,650 --> 05:38:23,390
of non-stop huggies.

5497
05:38:23,710 --> 05:38:24,310
Surely did.

5498
05:38:24,410 --> 05:38:26,890

05:38:27,170 --> 05:38:28,230

05:38:28,310 --> 05:38:28,550

Thank you.

5502
05:38:29,010 --> 05:38:30,150
That's what I'm saying.

5503
05:38:30,630 --> 05:38:31,990
Why can't I romance?

5504
05:38:32,290 --> 05:38:35,310
This is the perfect harem game, I would say.

5505
05:38:35,590 --> 05:38:39,230
I swear if season two does not give me a harem, then they
learn nothing.

5506
05:38:40,130 --> 05:38:49,950
This game, have been so much more popular and we could have
romanced everyone in our team why does he have to be a

5507
05:38:49,950 --> 05:39:00,390
hundred percent straight he could be a little bit curious
that's all i'm saying like being surrounded with all these

5508
05:39:00,390 --> 05:39:12,550
superheroes and super villains i mean so true you could be a
little curious i mean what's that game The Dungeons and

5509
05:39:12,550 --> 05:39:13,450
Dragons game.

5510
05:39:13,770 --> 05:39:15,730
That was that one game of the year.

5511
05:39:16,490 --> 05:39:19,450
Everyone loved that game because you could romance everyone.

5512
05:39:19,810 --> 05:39:20,970
That's why it was so popular.

5513
05:39:21,590 --> 05:39:29,590
I swear to God, if that game doesn't restricted the
romancing, the game would not have one game of the year,

5514
05:39:30,110 --> 05:39:30,110
chat.

5515
05:39:31,310 --> 05:39:31,810
Baldur's Gate.

5516
05:39:32,090 --> 05:39:39,290
If Baldur's Gate 3 restricted who you could romance, it
would not have one game of the year.

5517
05:39:42,390 --> 05:39:53,510
I should be allowed to romance everyone Hey guys, I'll see
you guys later everybody Bye guys Bye
