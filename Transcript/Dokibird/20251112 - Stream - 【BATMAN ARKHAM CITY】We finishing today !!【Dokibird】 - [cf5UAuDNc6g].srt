And today's the next time.

19
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,940
I already forgot all the controls because we didn't have to wait.

20
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,580
Last week was fucking crazy for me.

21
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,580
Last week.

22
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,560
Last week was insane.

23
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,480
There was a lot.

24
00:03:34,540 --> 00:04:26,280
so much stuff I don't know how I survived last week today today we are back with Batman I will have to say for those who are looking through like we saw a schedule for this week Saturday we are rescheduling Saturday's our greatest dream with Altair and Beto to the next week um it might be next Saturday it might be earlier I'm not sure yet um because Beto um it's a little awkward because like i posted my schedule because i was like all right i've i i've like delayed it a bit like there's no way it's gonna get rescheduled like it's it's three in the morning there's no way it's gonna be rescheduled because like i waited for full confirmation to like post it and then literally an hour later eltair was like oh Oh,

25
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,880
this is awkward, but Beto can't make it.

26
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,600
Something came up.

27
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:34,800
Oh, man.

28
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,040
I was like, bro.

29
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,980
I waited till 3 a.m.

30
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,340
Bro.

31
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,180
What do you...

32
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,480
I waited till...

33
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,880
Yeah, no, no.

34
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,500
Like, Beto's like, bro, my bad, man.

35
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:56,840
My bad.

36
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,120
No, no.

37
00:04:59,180 --> 00:04:59,800
It wasn't Beto.

38
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:30,880
fault it wasn't bedo's fault um because like uh i asked altair first and then i think altair assumed we were all good to go like because like i was like oh hey we can add bedo because i saw bedo playing our creators and i was like who should we get as a third and then um and then i like altair uh just assumed that bedo was free this week so he's like yeah yeah saturday at 5 p.m that's good to go and then bedo was like wait a minute i'm not gonna be here on saturday well i said i was on a Saturday.

39
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,400
It was like, wait a minute.

40
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,660
I said I'm free, but I forgot to mention what day I'm not free.

41
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,820
so Bella was just like, was just not free on Saturday.

42
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:56,660
And by then I was just like, we'll just postpone it next week.

43
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,520
And so I don't know what to do on Saturday.

44
00:05:58,680 --> 00:07:17,440
Maybe it'll just be me doing something else I don't know yet um um uh so we'll I'll figure that out later we'll figure that out later maybe it'll just be me out there doing some other fucking random games but I gotta figure out like what perms does he have too like that's like um that's the hardest part is just figuring out like what what games he can play like so so um so I gotta we gotta look through that or if not then it'll just be I'll maybe I'll do something solo I don't know yet also other than that um no soundproofing yet um apparently it's crazy but when you call on set on it's crazy I don't know you guys know this but when you call on Sunday regarding soundproof they don't do it on Sunday or like the next day you guys know that in the adult world you have to make appointments ahead of time isn't that fucking wild like like they can't just you can't just like be like what if I pay extra and you guys just come over today and they're like um ma'am um I don't get that's crazy I

45
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:31,200
like I was like what about tomorrow they're like ma'am next available date that we can come over and check your place is So we don't have sound.

46
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,460
Yeah, imagine that.

47
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:36,480
I can't believe people have, like, others to work before me.

48
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,400
Like, isn't that wild?

49
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:42,020
Like, I'm like, what the fuck do you mean I'm not your only customer?

50
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:50,300
You mean you have other customers to deal with and, like, that have already pre-arranged their appointments for you to come over?

51
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,120
Like, excuse me, but do you know I am the main character of this storyline?

52
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,500
How fucking dare they?

53
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:05,820
Anyway, uh, Doki was throwing at money, throwing money at the problem doesn't work.

There's other people's lives in this Doki verse?

65
00:08:30,660 --> 00:09:18,480

66
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:26,000
yeah, I was gonna say I was like what the fuck like How many people in this area need soundproofing?

67
00:09:26,360 --> 00:10:53,720
uh but apparently like uh that's not like the only thing they do as well so um so uh i call them and they're like we can come over on thursday to exam like you know uh to like check your stuff check the place and like maybe we can do the soundproofing like oh yeah it's gonna be like how is there like millions of streamers here like so um so the they'll be here around on Thursday and uh and they're gonna check everything out out but I also had a really rough day yesterday I fucking hate my bank guys I know I told you guys how much I hate my bank but no okay I I wrote this rant to my manager so let me read this rant to you guys I'll read it word to word like I I'm not gonna tell you guys like a whole story I want you guys to the emotion of this call so all right so long story short I found out that one of my credit okay sorry I found out that my credit card doesn't work and I was like why the fuck is it not working because I was trying to make an online purchase all right here you go

68
00:10:53,720 --> 00:12:26,260
I've been in a two hour call with this bank and apparently they locked both my cards because they thought it was fraud like someone took my cards and did random charges on it and now they have to send me a new card to replace it even though i said there is no fraud it is so frustrating i was wondering why i couldn't use it to pay for things but like it's been locked since August but sometimes the payment goes through and sometimes it doesn't how the fuck was I supposed to know it was locked I wasn't given any warning that it was locked I hate my bank okay so long story short so I was like why the fuck can i buy anything online with this card so so um so you know you gotta be in a you gotta wait you gotta be on hold where you want to fucking talk to your uh to your credit card uh line so i was i waited for two hours like just like like on hold but it was like a back and forth so like because like I was just like yeah um for some reason I can't uh I can't uh I can't like do anything

69
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:43,920
about my card because because like it won't let me pay for anything online so then they're like oh sorry ma'am this is the wrong um channel for that let me like redirect you like by the way before they redirected me they're like ma'am can you give me your full name all right what is the business,

70
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,280
what is your business name?

71
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,600
Okay, can you also tell me, um, how much credit do you have on your credit card?

72
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:56,140
All that information, you know, like, oh, and what is like the last four digits of your card?

73
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,040
And then they're like, okay, ma'am, what can we do for you?

74
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:04,180
And I was like, oh, um, so I can't make the purchase online on this card for some reason.

75
00:13:04,580 --> 00:14:16,460
Um, and like, I checked the, my bank, I checked the bank account and it says I still have enough credit for it and she was like oh sorry this is the wrong like division for this let me redirect you uh to to like um the small business division and i was like oh okay and then bam gotta wait another 30 to 40 minutes on hold um and this is like like it was like 12 p.m by the way so so anyway so i waited and then finally i got hold and i was like okay so so yeah uh and they're like what can i do for you and then you know what is your full name man what is your full name what is your business name what is the last four digits of your credit card what is the phone number that you use that's associated with this business and i'm like pop pop pop pop pop and they're like okay ma'am let me check this for you and they're like oh this card has been locked since august for fraud and i was like what the fuck for fraud the thing is i never noticed it because i could sometimes use the card in person

76
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:58,600
so um so like it never like like thought like i just thought like sometimes like oh maybe like i'm the purchase was too high so i couldn't use it so i i was like really confused because I have used this card for other purchases in person and I never got a text or any a call or anything that told me that the card was locked but I realized wait I can't use yeah I checked my email too I realized like wait how come I can't use this card online because I had to make a big purchase online um and so I was like that's weird I was like that's weird because I was able to make purchases before on this card after August.

77
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,840
So how the fuck was I supposed to know it got locked?

78
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,860
So anyway, by the way, do you know why it was locked in August?

79
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:11,720
Because I was in fucking China and like using the card.

80
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,360
But like I was able to use it.

81
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:23,640
Because I looked at the dates and I was like, that's weird.

82
00:15:24,140 --> 00:16:57,380
I was making purchases in China and the cart and it went through so um so I was just like why why the fuck was I locked for fraud when I was still able to make purchases in China like no it still worked so I was so confused because it still worked back then so I never noticed it but apparently that was the day they flagged it as fraud um anyway anyway so i was so confused i was like oh it's not fraud like i was traveling in china so like it it wasn't fraud like it's okay you can unlock it and they're like sorry ma'am in these scenarios since we've already flagged your card for fraud we have to send you a new card i was like but none of these purchases are suspicious so like i'm like i'm looking through these purchases and like i've made all these purchases none of them are suspicious what do you mean you have to send me a new fucking card so i was just like i'm like dude like man this is like it's just protocol but i'm like but it's not suspicious like i told you it's not fraud it's

83
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:18,140
not fraud is this really the only way like yes ma'am sorry um we have to but the thing is the card is still usable i could use this card in person i just can't use it online so is it is it terminated i even is the card actually terminated or not i don't know

84
00:17:22,840 --> 00:18:33,340
so so anyway anyway so they're like we have to send you a new card because you can't we it's like protocol because we already marked that card as um we already marked that card as suspicious and like fraud so we have to send you a new card so I was like okay um when can I like you know I was like oh okay so when can I uh get this card and they're like oh you'll get it in a week and I was like okay I had that play I was just like okay I gotta figure this out because I was planning on using this card to pay for the soundproofing because it is a business expense so I'm like oh fuck okay if it gets too expensive because this one has like some more credit so i was just like can you check my other business card and because like i have a second business card but it's like for a different it's for a different it's under a different name under a different company name so i was just like can you check that one because for some reason i couldn't use this card to pay for things either um but like

85
00:18:33,340 --> 00:19:07,520
i already paid it off the credit for this too so it should it doesn't have a that it has like 3k basically want the one they locked has a uh the one they locked has a 20k credit limit um which is a lot and that's why i like that card and then the other one the other one is for small purchases it has 3k credit limit so i so the thing is i wanted to use the 20k credit limit to pay for the soundproofing um and then the 3k for like small business expensive yeah so but then the thing is the

86
00:19:10,560 --> 00:20:29,480
on the big card not the small card so i was just like but it still wouldn't let me do big purchases like it won't let me do big purchases or anything it's not really tmi it's just credit like limit it's a credit limit it's not really tmi um it's just it's like it's like um yeah but it's like depending on like for business expenses and stuff it's not like i spend 20k right off the bat purchase I have to make for my business you know like 3d stuff I'll use the I'll use the the big credit card uh so so um anyway anyway um uh I was like can you check my other card it's in Canadian by the way it's a Canadian bank account I fucking hate my bank account anyway so I was like is that one not because i can't do it the purchase with that because it's 3k and not because and you're like oh it's because you try to charge something that was 3 000 and 3 000 and 100 so the the payment didn't go through because you don't have enough credit limit for that and i'm like a fucking question like the the 100

87
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:40,280
was the what's the limit the 100 drew the line for that card So, like, that's why, so I, because I thought it was two cards got locked.

88
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,820
I was like, why can't I use my other card?

89
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:56,380
So, I was like, oh, well, um, does that, can you, like, you know, uh, maybe help me increase the credit limit for that card?

90
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:00,480
Like, I, like, at that point, I was just like, can you increase the credit limit on that card?

91
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,760
Because I might as well.

92
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,120
Um, I might as well.

93
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:07,020
And they were like, oh, that's not my division.

94
00:21:07,480 --> 00:22:01,120
connect you to someone else so so so they're like i'm sorry man that is not my division i will connect you to someone else to to check if you can up your credit limit for that card so i waited maybe another 30 minutes and then i got got to a new person and they're like we go through the same rodeo the same the same merry-go-round what's your phone name um what's the what's the business name what is the last four digits of your credit card number what is the number associated with with what's your phone number associated with your business what oh and then they added something new this time um what is the credit limit limit that you have on this card you know And then so,

95
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,440
okay, I went through the hoop and they're like, what can I do for you today, man?

96
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:18,620
And I was like, I would like to increase the credit limit for this card because like I need to make a purchase and the limit for this card is a little too, is too low right now.

97
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,780
And I need to up the credit limit.

98
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:28,740
And she's like, okay, let me go check, let me go check and see if you have any pre-approved offers for your card.

99
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,060
then she was like, I'm sorry, ma'am.

100
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:35,460
You don't have any pre-approved credit upgrades.

101
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:41,720
So we're going to have you apply, apply to have a, we have to check your credit score.

102
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,440
Um, is that okay?

103
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:50,460
But we have to check your credit score and also have you apply to see if you are eligible to increase your credit.

104
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,060
And I was like, yeah, that's cool.

105
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,680
That's fine.

106
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:53,460
Fuck it.

107
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,120
That's fine.

108
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,160
I have the whole day.

109
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,020
It's the rest day.

110
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,560
I should say, okay, let me redirect you to someone.

111
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:00,240
Yeah.

112
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:05,520
Let me redirect you to the person that takes care of that.

113
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:13,960
So, I got redirected again.

114
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:26,860
And I'm like, why the fuck did this person, why the fuck did the person before take me to her if she was just gonna redirect me anyway regarding upgrading my credit?

115
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:29,280
regarding approving my credit.

116
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:40,340
Because apparently the person that checks if I'm pre-approved to have a higher credit is different from the person that checks my credit score.

117
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:48,480
Like, so I was just like, why the fuck is the two different people?

118
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,520
It should be the same division.

119
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:54,400
It should be the same division.

120
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,420
And they're both about credit.

121
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,980
It should be the same.

122
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,160
And then...

123
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,560
So...

124
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,560
So...

125
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,500
Anyway...

126
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,440
Anyway...

127
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,920
I waited another 20 minutes this time.

128
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,560
Another 20 minutes.

129
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,600
Make it stop.

130
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,880
Anyway...

131
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,100
I waited another 20 minutes.

132
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,620
And then I got... I got punched in.

133
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:57,900
to a different division and she was like same thing what's your full name ma'am and i'm like why do none of you keep this record i'm like i'm the same person what's gonna happen i swap i change to someone new in between the on hold like there's a like when while we're on hold a new person takes over my phone so i'm like why are you still asking me this so so anyway Anyway,

134
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,100
again, what's your full name, ma'am?

135
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,120
What is your business name?

136
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:09,060
What are the last four digits of your credit card?

137
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,460
What is the phone number associated with your business?

138
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,180
Anyway, we got all that done.

139
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,740
And she was like, what can I do for you today, ma'am?

140
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:49,960
And I was like, oh, I'm here to, I got, I got, got directed here uh because uh because I'm trying to up my credit limit and then she was like sorry ma'am what can you repeat that I was like yeah I'm here to I I'm here to like up my credit limit for this card beep call dropped call

141
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,820
the call disconnected

142
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,780
they didn't hang up.

143
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:18,040
I looked on my phone and it said call failed.

144
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:31,180
So somehow I made it to the very end of the person I needed to talk to and the call fucking failed.

145
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:38,800
The moment she asked me finally, what am I, what do you, what can I do for you?

146
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,140
And I got there.

147
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:48,440
I wanted to, I got there, I said I needed to increase my credit limit, and then call failed.

148
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:48,980
I,

149
00:26:53,750 --> 00:27:02,090
it wasn't, it was not even like she hanged up and literally just failed.

150
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:06,490
I got, my bars were like, bam, it's over.

151
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:11,470
We gave you false hope just to fuck with you.

152
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:44,830
And then I think I was thinking truly they'll call back right like I I was it was almost it was two and a half hours of being on hold and being like like redirected to every fucking department possible in this bank and I was like truly they'll call back right they never called back Guys,

153
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:47,650
they fucking never called back.

154
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:51,170
And I didn't want to go through it again.

155
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:54,650
I didn't want to be on hold again, guys.

156
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:00,230
But it was not over.

157
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:03,710
Because I don't know if you guys remembered.

158
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:11,730
But I had to go back to...

159
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:14,390
I had to go and call my...

160
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:45,250
pet hot my dog hospital again and regarding regarding the uh regarding like appointment and stuff for dad's like kidney thing and and like they're like sorry internal medicine isn't here right now so please leave a voice message i left a voice message the day before this entire fucking fiasco and um um like it was like around like 5 p.m i went to take a shower last like 5 p.m.

161
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:50,310
I got out of the shower and I missed their call and it was like 10 minutes ago.

162
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:51,810
It was 10 minutes ago.

163
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,530
So I was like, okay, I'll call you.

164
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:54,770
I'll hurry and call back.

165
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,270
And I was just like, okay, hey.

166
00:28:56,930 --> 00:29:01,630
And then I was like, the receptionist picked up and they're like, oh, sorry.

167
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:03,810
You got, let me talk.

168
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:06,730
I don't know why you're, you're, you got redirected to receptionist.

169
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:12,970
Can you please be on hold for a bit while I try to get internal medicine to your call?

170
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:38,530
And I was like, yeah, that's cool that's no problem i've been on hold for like 90 of my day today so like what's one more hold gonna do to me um and then she got back to me and was like oh sorry i didn't turn a mess and got off for their day so we need i'll redirect you to their voicemail and you can leave them a message and i'm like thinking it was 10 minutes

171
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:50,670
They called me 10 minutes ago to be like, can you please call back so we could like make an appointment for dad?

172
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,730
And I was like, oh, cool, it's just 10 minutes ago.

173
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:54,370
Like, surely I can make this appointment.

174
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:57,290
But apparently in 10 minutes, they all left.

175
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:58,430
I don't know how.

176
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:00,270
They all fucking just left.

177
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:02,630
Like, oh, what's the point?

178
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:08,150
Like, why did they call me in the morning?

179
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:11,010
Because I left the voicemail the day before.

180
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:12,470
Like, yeah.

181
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:27,450
And so, so I was just like, I still haven't got my call back yet, guys, I still, but it's also Remembrance Day, so it makes sense because it's a holiday, but I'm like, how was I 10 minutes too late?

182
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:36,950
Like, how did they all just decide to get off work in 10 minutes when they told me, please call back soon so we can make an appointment?

183
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:39,810
And I was like, is 10 minutes not soon enough?

184
00:30:43,450 --> 00:32:17,990
something like so that was my day yesterday now you can tell why I had to take a nap to recover from yesterday I'm still I'm still recovering from yesterday right now so I had to take my egg oh yeah I went by the way yesterday I need you guys to know I was not okay after I was so angry went you know those rooms where you smash things so yesterday I was just like browsing Google Maps and I found a room like a building where you can go in and smash the I actually it was pretty cheap though yes I went to the rage room yes I actually went to a rage room yesterday and they gave me like they had like crowbars and everything so yeah no it was it was bad like I was so mad yeah yeah I was so fucking I was like oh my god there was an actual angry room I was like oh my god like I need this right now I like it's cheaper than therapy for sure um but wait let me read you the the messages I sent my manager all right all right okay I didn't I hate my bank I was on hold for 20 plus minutes and then I

185
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:58,110
got through them and they asked all my info to confirm like oh your full name your business address etc and finally we got to the part where they're like what can we do for you and I said increase my credit line and then the call dropped and okay and then I was like the hospital called me back to make an appointment but I missed I was taking a shower but I was like 10 minutes late to the call so I called back instantly and then was told that they just got off of work and won't call me back until Wednesday so I have to leave a voicemail.

186
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:00,290
L-O-L.

187
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:06,890
I was literally 10 minutes late.

188
00:33:15,250 --> 00:34:15,710
was that was my day yesterday at this point just go wide at the room i would pay for it on george thank you but let's see for chat thank you thank you but i'll show you guys i'll show you guys what they offered me in the in the rage room i so um they gave us like okay so so it was crazy because like um for the rage room they gave like um they gave you choices for uh for like what you can break and um included in the price was glass it was like um what is it called they're like basically like glass cups like glass beer bottles that you can throw against the wall the thing is i can't show you guys the room itself because then people would sort of know where it is uh so i can't really so i could like Like,

189
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:21,530
I could, like, basically get the, like, pick up the glass and just start chucking it at the wall or some shit.

190
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:25,450
Or, like, the other alternative is that, okay, let's see.

191
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:32,410
Is that they have these, which I find out how heavy crowbars are.

192
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:43,010
So this is this lovely selection of weapons that I got to pick from yesterday.

193
00:34:46,290 --> 00:35:37,310
and i found out how fucking heavy uh crowbars are that day um so choose your web yeah that fat is fucked up yeah that's a fun like people were fucking angry i was asking the guy i was just like so like what the fuck do people do and they're like oh yeah no um because on the floor was just like a bunch of like broken thing items like because like it's just like a accumulation of everybody that was in the rage room um and so like he was like yeah like 30 minutes is like the limit in this room the maximum limit you can be in this room and he's like even when you like he's like oh yeah even when people broke all the things that they purchased they would just start smashing the items on the floor and just go ham and i was just like damn like this is definitely cheaper than therapy i was like

194
00:35:41,450 --> 00:36:33,410
he was just like yeah no they just like they just started like standing in the pile of trash and just fucking start swinging and screaming while like uh hammering the trash and i'm like damn i fucking need that like i fucking need that so so i did pay extra for one thing because like um the glass beer bottles were like wasn't cool i also did like i also like smashed like you know i perched there was like uh there's like a little perch thing and i could put the glass bottle like the glass beer bottle um on top of this little perch thing and then like and then i could just um and i could just i used it as like a perch and just like play baseball and just smashed it with a crowbar i got a crowbar i was like oh i was like ah And like,

195
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:42,070

196
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:44,750
Not the fucked up one, the other, the bar one.

197
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:47,990
Like, hey, batter back.

198
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:52,590
Anyway, so, so I did that.

199
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:56,410
And there is, there is a Bluetooth speaker.

200
00:36:56,910 --> 00:37:01,490
The guy was like, oh, yeah, if you want to play music or anything, you can link up your...

201
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,990
phone to this Bluetooth speaker.

202
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:05,070
But like at that point, I wasn't here for music.

203
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:08,370
I was not, I was not here for music.

204
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:13,070
So there was one item that I picked that I paid extra for.

205
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:16,910
It was only $20 because it was like, you know, I was just like $20 and $20.

206
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:22,910
And like there was one item that I picked that I was like, I'm gonna fucking go on town.

207
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:27,750
I was like, these glass bottles are not

208
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:35,510
Yeah, no, no music, just pure rage.

209
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:40,410
I was like, these glass bottles are not enough for me.

210
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:43,350
Like, the glass cups.

211
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:45,470
I need something more.

212
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:48,590
So, um, I got, I bought a giant ass monitor.

213
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:49,830
Like, it was $20.

214
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:52,170
And I bought it, like, a giant ass monitor.

215
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:53,670
And I got a crowbar.

216
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:55,150
And I was just like, oh!

217
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:10,800
I just started, I got the crowbar and just, Started fucking hammering it like yesterday was last week and yesterday was so much.

218
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,520
I fucking hate my bake

219
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:35,140
Yeah, so um look it was twenty dollars was twice like I said cheaper than therapy Um, um, so um, so I got the crowbar you could tell that it was a crowbar Like, because you can see the hole.

220
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:43,200
So I got a crowbar and just started fucking hammering the shit out of this bioner.

221
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,620
Yeah, it was like, like, roid rage.

222
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:56,040
So that was my day yesterday.

223
00:38:56,780 --> 00:39:00,000
And now you see why I needed to take my nap today.

224
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,960
Like, I'm still recovering from yesterday.

225
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:52,140
I that day was the day I learned how fucking heavy crowbars are it was so heavy I was like Jesus Christ like this shit was heavy um um but yeah anyway patricia thank you for the super chat thank you thank you looking for a new monitor smash your old one in a fit of rage don't Super recommends the mpg 300 200 urx qdoled by msi check it out in the description of this video thank you for the super chat thank you thank you um but anyway Batman time oh I don't know how to segue this but Batman time time for Batman we're gonna finish it today all right let's let's boot up

226
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,680
Oh, yeah.

227
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,940
Yeah, I needed it, though, guys.

228
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:03,380
I really needed it.

229
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:11,500
Yeah, I was thinking of myself as the Joker and that monitor as Jason Todd.

230
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,600
But this time, he ain't coming back.

231
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:16,160
That monitor ain't coming back.

232
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:24,490
How is the soundproofing in that raid trip?

233
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:59,690
Okay, the funny thing is that, like, um it wasn't just a rage room like facility they also had escape rooms as well so so i could hear the music and people trying to figure out how they escape while i'm smashing the items in that room i i could hear like the fucking music coming from one of the escape rooms next to me while i'm like So I'm like wondering,

234
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:09,950
do they hear like, like, I'm wondering, because like one of the escape room themes is like literally like, um, it's like a prison break or some shit.

235
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:18,490
And I'm like wondering, are they thinking it was just immersion where like I'm just a sound clip being played up in the background for it to make sure they're more immersed?

236
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:24,410
You know, that's what I'm like thinking.

237
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:30,510
you down in the escape room.

238
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:31,070
Keep that.

239
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:32,230

00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:24,010
yeah I was gonna say like I'm just thinking like why like like what do are they thinking right now for a merchant we had an actual serial killer trying to get you in the next room over yeah I'm like do they think it's like like I'm just part of the room like part of the escape room

257
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:30,650
So you became Batman yesterday.

258
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:34,950
No, I'm the Batman that does kill.

259
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:37,610
Okay, it's not in there.

260
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:41,830
No, Batman's too much of a fucking pussy to finish the job.

261
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:44,030
There wouldn't be another joke.

262
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:50,210
There wouldn't, Joker would not be sending people at Super Aids if I'm there for the city.

263
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,300
Alright, scanning time.

264
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:00,640
Let me scan!

265
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,780
Oh my god, it's out of range.

266
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:03,880
Alright, how about you?

267
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:06,340
Already scanned?

268
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,800
God damn it.

269
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:11,620
Where would it be closer?

270
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:14,580
Is it you?

271
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:16,880
It's not you.

272
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,680
Wait, you can't, you'll shoot back?

273
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:20,840
I didn't know that.

274
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,020
Oh, I can grapple.

275
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,100
I forgot about that.

276
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,060
I can grapple on him.

277
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,380
What are you doing?

278
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:28,540
What are you looking at?

279
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:29,260
Get away!

280
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:33,620
No, you don't.

281
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:34,560
Nuh-uh.

282
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:38,000
Doki became Doki-tot.

283
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,100
Dang, I think it was a super chat.

284
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,280
Thank you, thank you.

285
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:42,800
Nuh-uh.

286
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:45,240
Stop!

287
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:46,780
Stop!

288
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:47,940
This is not cool.

289
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,780
Don't make me go back to the rage room.

290
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,480
Don't make me go back.

291
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:59,660
I don't even know which one I'm scanning, which one I haven't scanned.

292
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:16,700
guys you know how much i um how i was so angry i didn't even look at how much how expensive the room was like i knew what i wanted price was not the question here

293
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,940
are you serious where the fuck is this plane

294
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:32,800
holy shit There's so many helicopters!

295
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:38,480
What the fuck is paying for all these helicopters?

296
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:49,160
Okay, but like, this was like, I didn't use my business card for it, unfortunately.

297
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:50,040
I...

298
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:58,260
I felt like it should have been a business expense for what I had to deal with.

299
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:01,220
I'm de-stressing from my work.

300
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:26,100
all right let's scan these helicopters oh my god bro there's so many like where are we getting this funding and yet they still beg me for money why are they still begging me for money

301
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:39,320
oh my god no you don't uh closing welcome to the tomato farm welcome Welcome.

302
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:51,400
If they can afford, maybe if they don't spend it on the 20th helicopter, Gotham City wouldn't have to be in debt all the time.

303
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:54,760
Oh my god.

304
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:00,280
There's no way I would fund for this.

305
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:04,600
Alright, let's figure this out.

306
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:08,300
I need to scan this one goddamn helicopter that's on top of me.

307
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:15,300
Oh my god, there you go.

308
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:18,940
Oh my god, we did it!

309
00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:23,870
Get over here!

310
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:25,170
Get over here!

311
00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:26,650
I found you!

312
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:32,240
Oh my god, I found him.

313
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:36,520
Alright, there you go.

314
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:37,420
Wee!

315
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:40,620
What do I do here?

316
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:42,420
Oh, download it.

317
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:42,700
Alright.

318
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:45,820
You wouldn't download a helicopter, would you?

319
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:52,220
I've got the code.

320
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:53,720
I'm heading to Wonder Tower.

321
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:54,120
Good.

322
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:55,260
You're doing the right thing.

323
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:57,960
The code should let you enter via the guardroom.

324
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:00,960
Don't lose Talia's signal.

325
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:04,200
When I'm finished in the tower, I'm going Greetings from Serbia.

326
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:05,940
Hello, so thank you for the super chat.

327
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:06,320
Thank you.

328
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:07,020

00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:11,240
Alright.

332
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,120
I gained access to the Wonder Tower.

333
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:15,180
Okay, I gotta head here.

334
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:15,800
Alright.

335
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:19,060
Breach, gain access.

336
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:19,780

You're so needy, Batgirl.

340
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:30,360
Oracle.

341
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:33,220
I'm already heading there.

342
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,840
All you gotta do is just sit on your ass.

343
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:38,740
I mean, like, to be fair, it's like, um...

344
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:42,780
To be fair, I will say it was out of your head.

345
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,300

00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:19,550
You can't cancel Bruce Wayne?

364
00:49:20,330 --> 00:49:22,190
He'll just buy his way out!

365
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:29,510
They'll just throw money at it and it'll disappear!

366
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:31,590
That's right.

367
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,020
All right, we have it this way.

368
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,720
Arkham City Processing Center.

372
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:52,800
What is the ice?

373
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:54,680

Or is the political prisoner?

384
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:55,240
If you have tiger guards have stun sticks, I need to attack from behind to avoid being hit.

385
00:50:57,980 --> 00:50:58,420
AAX.

386
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:00,520

There we go.

393
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,000
Oh my god, I forgot how to play this game.

394
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:29,640
I didn't.

395
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:30,840
Guys, it's been a while.

396
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:31,760
It's been a while.

397
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:34,120
Okay.

398
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:35,880
Don't worry, whoa!

399
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:37,960
Alright, there you go.

400
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,580
You did it.

401
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:41,960
And then...

402
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,220
Takedown!

403
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:45,560
Stop right there, Batman.

404
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:47,320
We need to talk.

405
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:48,100
Oh, who's he?

406
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:52,220
I know you wouldn't be able to live with yourself if your actions were...

407
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:53,800
I don't even know who this guy is!

408
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:57,620
I have a question for you.

409
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:03,700
Before my arrival, this city was drowning under a time to fill.

410
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:09,820
Hey, guys, guys, I am listening to him right now.

411
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:10,900
This is a cutscene.

412
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:12,180
Guys, this is a cutscene.

413
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:13,920
I can't do anything about it.

414
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:16,740
Bro, I can't even walk.

415
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:18,300
I can only walk.

416
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:20,780
Guys, this is a cutscene.

417
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,080
You don't fight in a cutscene.

418
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,480
It's like how you don't interrupt the magical girl transforming.

419
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:27,400
It even exists if not for you.

420
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,680
It must be depressing.

421
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:37,240
All your sacrifices and yet, You are the one to blame.

422
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:38,080
I hate them.

423
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,000
I hate this.

424
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,080
This is beautiful.

425
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:42,360
We have a long...

426
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:43,900
They're breaking the sacred rule.

427
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:51,160
Soon, I will take my rightful place at my master's side.

428
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,500
There's more people coming in!

429
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:55,800
I'm still listening to this cutscene!

430
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,880
So thank you, Batman.

431
00:52:58,100 --> 00:52:59,420
What the fuck?

432

There's so many people here.

456
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:01,760
Okay.

464
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:19,120
Jesus Christ.

465
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:20,680
Guys, I don't think we're living this.

466
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:24,200

469
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:38,000
They all surrounded me in the cutscene.

470
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:41,620
I couldn't move!

471
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,160
You don't understand!

472
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:48,940
Guys, if I would, I would have moved.

473
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:52,520
You know it.

474
00:54:57,740 --> 00:54:58,860
Oh my god, I got hit.

475
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:03,180
Guys, it was not a choice that I fucking...

476
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:06,140
I just stood there, planning to beat me up.

477
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:08,240
Like, I don't know if you guys know this.

478
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:10,640
It was definitely not a choice for that to happen.

479
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,540
There you go.

480
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:19,800

00:56:09,490 --> 00:56:10,290
Okay, I did not expect.

500
00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:11,350

01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:25,580
It was a bloodbath.

607
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,840

01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:28,400
Where's my smoke?

620
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:31,120
Whoa!

621
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:33,260
Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry!

622
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:34,340
Serpentine!

623
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:35,020
Serpentine!

624
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:35,640
Serpentine!

625
01:03:37,420 --> 01:03:38,220
Serpentine!

626
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:40,840
Okay.

627
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:42,540
You don't know.

628
01:03:50,070 --> 01:03:51,770
They don't know.

629
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:55,310
We are the future.

630
01:03:55,630 --> 01:03:56,770
I told you they didn't know.

631
01:03:57,830 --> 01:03:58,570
Oh shit!

632
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:02,890
Shoot this guy!

633
01:04:03,830 --> 01:04:04,790
Okay, okay, okay.

634
01:04:04,830 --> 01:04:05,790
We got a self-disk.

635
01:04:06,490 --> 01:04:07,410
I got this.

636
01:04:09,070 --> 01:04:10,470
Guys, guys, I figured it out.

637
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:11,510
Watch this.

638
01:04:13,010 --> 01:04:13,470
Okay.

639
01:04:13,470 --> 01:04:16,690
Okay, let me... Okay, this is, like, fucked up.

640
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:17,510
Um...

641
01:04:17,510 --> 01:04:19,450
This is pretty fucked up.

642
01:04:19,530 --> 01:04:21,090
Like, how the fuck do I self-disk?

643
01:04:22,630 --> 01:04:23,090
Um...

644
01:04:23,910 --> 01:04:26,130
Um... Are there even gates anywhere?

645
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:28,870
Like...

646
01:04:30,410 --> 01:04:32,770
Wait, how the fuck do I self-disk?

647
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:36,980
Very insecure.

648
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:39,020
Tiger 43 to tell.

649
01:04:42,530 --> 01:04:43,150
Oh my god.

650
01:04:43,470 --> 01:04:43,730
Oh my god.

651
01:04:43,890 --> 01:04:44,770
This is all shit!

652
01:04:47,610 --> 01:04:48,090
Get out of here.

653
01:04:48,890 --> 01:04:50,330
Let me do this thing down first.

654
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:51,550
And then you can shoot me.

655
01:04:52,110 --> 01:04:53,010
Okay, okay, I figured it out.

656
01:04:58,200 --> 01:04:59,700
Oh my god, they know I'm here.

657
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:00,160
How?

658
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:04,840
Okay, watch this guys.

659
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:12,920
What?

660
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:15,140
Who looks down?

661
01:05:15,140 --> 01:05:16,980
What the

662
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:26,060
fuck looks down?

663
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:34,990
That's fucked up.

664
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:41,410
That's right.

665
01:05:48,490 --> 01:05:49,790
They don't go.

666
01:05:51,050 --> 01:05:54,770
They don't know.

667
01:05:55,710 --> 01:05:56,930
Okay, this is bullshit.

668
01:05:57,130 --> 01:05:58,250
This is actually bullshit.

669
01:05:58,470 --> 01:05:59,810
What the fuck is this?

670
01:06:01,790 --> 01:06:02,570
Okay.

671
01:06:04,330 --> 01:06:05,570
Switching to thermal.

672
01:06:06,170 --> 01:06:07,530
Oh no, not thermal.

673
01:06:08,290 --> 01:06:09,050
Oh no.

674
01:06:10,830 --> 01:06:11,930
Not thermal.

675
01:06:14,230 --> 01:06:15,730
Oh, that's awkward.

676
01:06:16,970 --> 01:06:18,950
That's gonna be awkward for me.

677
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:19,570
But.

678
01:06:21,790 --> 01:06:24,110
Wait, I have an idea.

679
01:06:24,790 --> 01:06:25,470
Watch this.

680
01:06:26,330 --> 01:06:29,130
Wait, he's gonna fucking put a grenade on there.

681
01:06:30,610 --> 01:06:31,630
That's not fair.

682
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,920
That's not fair at all.

683
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:38,960
Okay.

684
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:41,100
Wait, do I get help for a trophy?

685
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:43,000
Wait.

686
01:06:45,620 --> 01:06:46,460
You liars.

687
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:47,900
Okay, wait, watch this, though.

688
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:50,500
Watch this.

689
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:01,600
Okay, wait, I got...

690
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,140
Sorry, this was really hard.

691
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:07,900
Wait, give me a sec.

692
01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:08,980
Give me a sec.

693
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:09,980
There you go.

694
01:07:10,020 --> 01:07:10,300
There you go.

695
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:11,320
I had to slow down.

696
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:13,880

Oh shit, okay.

701
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:57,360

01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:38,320
I'm gonna end your bloodline right here!

712
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:41,300
Is he alive still?

713
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:42,640
There's no way!

714
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:46,880
Oh, here comes your play.

715
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:49,160
Are you still alive?

716
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:52,260
Are you still alive?

717
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:53,140
Don't worry.

718
01:08:53,580 --> 01:08:54,980
It's not gonna stop.

719
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:55,300
Ah!

721
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:01,540
Is he still alive?

722
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:04,580
Oh, he is.

723
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:08,340
Got your dick.

724
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:10,520
Oh my god, how long?

725
01:09:10,940 --> 01:09:12,560
Okay, guys, I'm gonna go die now.

726
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:19,080
Guys, if anything, we are not clutching this with 1HB.

727
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:23,140
We are not clutching this with 1HB, guys.

728
01:09:23,340 --> 01:09:23,660
I'm sorry.

729
01:09:23,740 --> 01:09:25,200
I don't know how to tell you this.

730
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,140
I don't think it's gonna work.

731
01:09:34,020 --> 01:09:35,460
He's taken out two of you.

732
01:09:36,140 --> 01:09:36,960
Find him.

733
01:09:43,860 --> 01:09:44,240
Alright.

734
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:47,200

735
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:50,320
Whoa!

736
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:51,880

What the fuck?

738
01:09:58,170 --> 01:09:59,710
Where did this guy come from?

739
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:05,960
It must have been the win, guys.

740
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:09,080
Like, how the fuck do I do this?

741
01:10:15,390 --> 01:10:16,010
Oh, no.

742
01:10:19,210 --> 01:10:20,290
Oh, my God.

Get down, Batman!

It's been a week guys.

Have mercy.

755
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:58,820

Where do I smoke pellets?

759
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:24,840
Oh my god.

760
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:25,500
Oh my god.

761
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:26,080
Give me a sec

762
01:12:30,260 --> 01:12:31,260
What the fuck?

763
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:31,680
Okay.

764
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:34,120
Okay, it's fine.

765
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:37,440
Wait, I have an idea.

766
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:41,480
I have an idea.

767
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:45,980
I have an idea.

768
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:47,280
Not here, not here, not yet, not yet.

769
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:48,540
That's not some idea yet.

770
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:49,780
Guys, it's not the idea.

771
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:51,700
This is not the idea.

772
01:12:51,860 --> 01:12:52,860
But I have an idea.

773
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:54,000
I know how to do this.

774
01:12:55,940 --> 01:12:58,200
Arkham City has become your tomb.

775
01:12:58,320 --> 01:12:59,700
Guys, I have an idea.

776
01:12:59,820 --> 01:13:01,380
I figured it out, guys.

777
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:05,620
Guys, I figured it out.

778
01:13:10,940 --> 01:13:11,980
I got the idea.

779
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:13,220
Watch this, guys.

780
01:13:25,810 --> 01:13:26,430
Call 10.

781
01:13:26,950 --> 01:13:31,230
I would like to congratulate all Tiger forces on this wonderful achievement.

782
01:13:32,190 --> 01:13:37,510
As I look at the screens in front of me, I can see that we are rapidly approaching the realities of

783
01:13:42,140 --> 01:13:42,320
this.

784
01:13:43,740 --> 01:13:44,500
Oh, shit.

785
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:46,100
Oh, shit.

786
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:47,180
You can just do that.

787
01:13:49,340 --> 01:13:49,860
No!

788
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:56,720
Where did I go?

789
01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:05,160
Where did I go?

790
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:08,680
Where did I go?

791
01:14:08,860 --> 01:14:09,120
No?

792
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:24,280
Oh my god, he's not close enough.

793
01:14:25,980 --> 01:14:26,580
There we go.

794
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:31,340
I'll get you close enough.

795
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:32,100
Oh!

796
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:37,820
Holy cheese, Batman.

797
01:14:38,620 --> 01:14:40,220
I don't need this rough day.

798
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:43,320
I just need to slowly get over here.

799
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:46,120
It works.

800
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:47,660
That's right.

801
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:52,960
Let's get to my pilot.

802
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:53,820
Okay.

803
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:54,700
All right.

804
01:14:55,380 --> 01:14:57,560
It's not camping, God.

805
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:00,720

842
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:13,380
Target is moving this way.

843
01:17:13,820 --> 01:17:14,180

844
01:17:15,140 --> 01:17:15,800

That's right.

849
01:17:24,420 --> 01:17:26,200
Your sniper friend can't help you now.

850
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:27,640
What the fuck?

851
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:28,300
That's right.

852
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:29,160

853
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:31,460
That's right.

854
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:34,580
What's your sniper friend gonna do?

855
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:35,380
Nothing.

856
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:39,040
That's looking right.

857
01:17:40,100 --> 01:17:41,880
Your sniper friends can only walk.

858
01:17:44,340 --> 01:17:46,960
That's the only thing they can do.

859
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:55,000
But where is the sniper?

860
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:56,100
Oh, there he is.

861
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:58,420
Oh, you're trying to swap positions?

862
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:00,260
That's goddamn right.

863
01:18:01,540 --> 01:18:03,200
Can't do shit now.

864
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:05,480
You gotta stay in location.

865
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:08,760
Gotta stay on your post.

866
01:18:09,980 --> 01:18:10,980
Oh, yeah.

867
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:12,760
You're finally gonna move.

868
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:14,620
Look at.

869
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:18,340
Oh, little does he know?

870
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:21,040
He's the only casualty left.

871
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:27,160
Get in my fist!

872
01:18:31,110 --> 01:18:33,790
I told you guys I'd figure it out.

873
01:18:39,460 --> 01:18:40,440
I told you guys.

874
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:44,140
I told none of you believed me.

875
01:18:44,580 --> 01:18:46,480
But I knew I would figure it out.

876
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:50,880
I knew I could figure it out.

877
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:51,440
Hellcast.

878
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:53,200
I knew it.

879
01:18:54,100 --> 01:18:56,040
You all didn't believe me.

880
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:57,800
How do I get in here?

881
01:19:00,540 --> 01:19:01,540
I hacked this?

882
01:19:02,380 --> 01:19:03,180
It's already hacked.

883
01:19:06,380 --> 01:19:07,940
All those bodies.

884
01:19:12,620 --> 01:19:13,380
I thought it already hacked.

885
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:14,520
It's green, though.

886
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:15,540
What the fuck?

887
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:16,620
Okay, I did not see that.

888
01:19:21,980 --> 01:19:23,480
Oh, I guess it's not hacked yet.

889
01:19:23,700 --> 01:19:25,260
I thought it was hacked because it was green.

890
01:19:31,970 --> 01:19:34,470
What our password could be, could it be?

891
01:19:35,770 --> 01:19:36,230
Obsession?

892
01:19:37,330 --> 01:19:40,050
We believe you would, could only do it with cheese.

893
01:19:40,570 --> 01:19:42,090

01:19:43,330 --> 01:19:44,770
It's the only way.

896
01:19:44,990 --> 01:19:46,270
It's the doki way.

897
01:19:53,770 --> 01:19:54,250
Medication.

898
01:19:58,530 --> 01:20:02,490
Doki plays the claw machine a very different way from the rest of us.

899
01:20:02,690 --> 01:20:04,550
Papa, thank you for the super chat.

Thank you.

901
01:20:12,310 --> 01:20:15,650
I knew playing it normally wasn't it.

902
01:20:16,090 --> 01:20:16,650
Silly me.

903
01:20:17,350 --> 01:20:23,550
When you trade your army against a professional vigilante and not against Turkey.

904
01:20:24,010 --> 01:20:24,570
Absolutely.

905
01:20:25,430 --> 01:20:26,150

Don't get, uh, don't get, uh, don't get him involved.

910
01:20:43,850 --> 01:20:46,390
Don't get my butler involved in this.

911
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:47,870
What the fuck?

912
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:50,370
Bro, he doesn't get paid enough for this shit.

913
01:20:51,630 --> 01:20:51,770
Back there.

914
01:20:51,870 --> 01:20:52,950

01:23:14,710 --> 01:23:15,830
I'll try to get behind him.

945
01:23:17,910 --> 01:23:18,270
Okay.

946
01:23:18,590 --> 01:23:20,750
Buddy, I said no guns allowed.

01:23:24,690 --> 01:23:29,430

All right, you.

955
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:50,820
You're easier.

956
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:52,820
That's right.

957
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:54,540
Killed all your friends.

958
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:56,420
Now what can I...

959
01:23:56,420 --> 01:23:57,410
Wait, can I tag him?

960
01:24:01,990 --> 01:24:03,540

01:24:34,210 --> 01:24:35,790
You're so lucky.

969
01:24:36,530 --> 01:24:38,990
I can't do the thing I wanted to do.

970
01:24:40,050 --> 01:24:40,470
Let's see.

971
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:45,360
That's right.

972
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:46,900
That's hot.

973
01:24:47,620 --> 01:24:49,400
We're bringing back electrotherapy.

974
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:55,080

01:25:00,700 --> 01:25:01,360
All right.

977
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:02,540
What do I do here?

978
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:07,580
Bro, I can't even... Wait.

979
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:10,840
I think I can't even beat him up because he's on the floor.

980
01:25:13,380 --> 01:25:14,180
Oh, no.

981
01:25:14,700 --> 01:25:15,220
Oh, no.

982
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:16,720
I played with my food too much.

983
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:17,500
There you go.

984
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:18,040
Get up.

985
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:20,200
I played with my food too much.

986
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:21,480
I gotta get you out now.

987
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:27,000
Alright, there you go.

988
01:25:28,700 --> 01:25:30,500
You almost soft-locked my game.

989
01:25:38,420 --> 01:25:40,200
Alright, what do I do now, Batman?

990
01:25:44,180 --> 01:25:45,240
Reach to stop.

991
01:25:45,380 --> 01:25:46,420
Wait, do I have to keep going up?

992
01:25:46,820 --> 01:25:47,900
Am I not up yet?

993
01:25:52,220 --> 01:25:53,480
I'm already up.

994
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:55,180
Oh, here.

995
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:55,640
Okay.

996
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,220
I was gonna say, there's a higher up?

997
01:26:07,290 --> 01:26:07,770
Safeguarding.

998
01:26:08,870 --> 01:26:09,210
There.

999
01:26:14,300 --> 01:26:17,020
It says do not enter, which means I should enter.

1000
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:23,160
Okay, okay, I got a little worried.

1001
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:25,940
Okay, that was...

1002
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:27,960
That was a little too close.

1003
01:26:35,770 --> 01:26:36,630
What's this?

1004
01:26:41,670 --> 01:26:43,310
Wait, what's this thing over here?

1005
01:26:44,510 --> 01:26:45,790
I don't know what this is.

1006
01:26:46,050 --> 01:26:47,790
Am I supposed to do anything with that?

1007
01:26:49,790 --> 01:26:50,350
Whatever.

1008
01:26:51,750 --> 01:26:53,050
Not that important, I think.

1009
01:26:55,310 --> 01:26:56,510
It looks cool though.

1010
01:26:58,750 --> 01:26:59,430
Anything here?

1011
01:27:05,950 --> 01:27:07,250
Wait, why is it green?

1012
01:27:11,580 --> 01:27:13,020
Can I break this?

1013
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:14,380
Why are you green?

1014
01:27:18,670 --> 01:27:18,910
What?

1015
01:27:20,930 --> 01:27:22,170
Why are you green?

1016
01:27:23,790 --> 01:27:24,930
Is this the Riddler juice?

1017
01:27:25,070 --> 01:27:26,770
Oh my god, is this related?

1018
01:27:26,950 --> 01:27:29,910
Oh my god, is this related to Riddling me this?

1019
01:27:30,670 --> 01:27:32,430
God damn, how are you here?

1020
01:27:33,050 --> 01:27:35,170
Oh my god, this is your father, Riddler.

1021
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:42,660
This is his fault.

1022
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:44,440
It's always his fault.

1023
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:48,240
I'm supposed to electrocute it.

1024
01:27:52,190 --> 01:27:53,070
He's just everywhere.

1025
01:27:53,290 --> 01:27:54,850
Everywhere I look, I see him.

1026
01:27:58,050 --> 01:27:59,670
Am I not supposed to be here?

1027
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:14,340
I don't know if I'm supposed to be here, guys.

1028
01:28:17,420 --> 01:28:18,440
I have the tower.

1029
01:28:19,580 --> 01:28:20,860
Up, then left?

1030
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:22,860
I'll climb it again.

1031
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:27,620
Go up and look at the tower.

1032
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:28,420
The ledge.

1033
01:28:32,810 --> 01:28:33,110
Okay.

1034
01:28:37,460 --> 01:28:39,360
Yeah, I'm like, where's the ledge?

1035
01:28:40,540 --> 01:28:42,180
Keep going up.

1036
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:45,720
The fuck is the ledge for this?

1037
01:28:51,180 --> 01:28:52,180
Oh my god.

1038
01:28:57,410 --> 01:28:59,170
The two pipes on the left.

1039
01:29:00,570 --> 01:29:02,150
Two pipes on the left?

1040
01:29:08,140 --> 01:29:08,620
Am I blind?

1041
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:09,060
I'm blind.

1042
01:29:09,180 --> 01:29:10,020
I'm fucking blind.

1043
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:10,940
I know I'm blind.

1044
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:15,000
I'm blind.

1045
01:29:15,160 --> 01:29:15,780
There's no way.

1046
01:29:15,880 --> 01:29:17,640
I'm definitely blind right now.

1047
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:19,520
I'm...

1048
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:20,740
There's no way.

1049
01:29:24,860 --> 01:29:26,740
Go up, then look left.

1050
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:37,440
Left.

1051
01:29:38,420 --> 01:29:38,640
Here?

1052
01:29:50,050 --> 01:29:51,350
There's no way.

1053
01:29:52,950 --> 01:29:54,030
Because this is where...

1054
01:29:57,270 --> 01:29:59,670
Oh, run the jump!

1055
01:30:00,330 --> 01:30:01,290
Oh my god, I'm blind.

1056
01:30:01,390 --> 01:30:02,310
I am actually blind.

1057
01:30:05,330 --> 01:30:07,830
Because it did not look like anything to me.

1058
01:30:10,430 --> 01:30:10,770
Okay.

1059
01:30:12,630 --> 01:30:13,070
Whoa!

1060
01:30:13,670 --> 01:30:14,570
Okay, there you go.

1061
01:30:16,290 --> 01:30:16,960
Guys, there...

1062
01:30:17,990 --> 01:30:18,610

1063
01:30:18,610 --> 01:30:22,710
Okay, but to my defense, where is the yellow paint?

1064
01:30:24,390 --> 01:31:28,220

01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:32,100
Oh, wait.

1067
01:31:32,100 --> 01:31:32,740
That's just for it.

1068
01:31:32,740 --> 01:31:33,340
We don't need her.

1069
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:34,660
Oh, wait.

1070
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:35,520
That's all for her.

1071
01:31:35,880 --> 01:31:37,200
We don't need for Serena.

1072
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:38,480
You don't need this shit.

1073
01:31:43,350 --> 01:31:43,750
Wait.

1074
01:31:44,270 --> 01:31:44,710
Oh, yeah.

1075
01:31:44,710 --> 01:31:45,330
We don't need that.

1076
01:31:45,430 --> 01:31:45,850
Let's get.

1077
01:31:46,130 --> 01:31:47,410
Oh, I don't know what to get.

1078
01:31:47,550 --> 01:31:48,190
What the heck?

1079
01:31:50,390 --> 01:31:52,030
Line launcher type, bro.

1080
01:31:53,450 --> 01:31:54,090
Okay, yeah.

1081
01:31:54,210 --> 01:31:55,890
I don't think we need any of that.

1082
01:31:55,990 --> 01:31:56,930
What do we get?

1083
01:31:58,670 --> 01:31:59,610
I'll grab this.

1084
01:32:05,960 --> 01:32:08,220
I'm just like, what is the Riddler doing here?

1085
01:32:14,300 --> 01:32:16,120
Alright, now we're inside.

1086
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:16,680
Oh, wait.

1087
01:32:16,820 --> 01:32:18,160
No, we were inside before.

1088
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:19,720
Now we're back here.

1089
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:21,000
Wait, what?

1090
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:24,900
Wait a minute.

1091
01:32:26,300 --> 01:32:27,060
Wait, what?

1092
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:28,160
Oh, here you go.

1093
01:32:28,580 --> 01:32:29,700
I have to look up.

1094
01:32:30,660 --> 01:32:31,680
Gamers don't look up.

1095
01:32:36,070 --> 01:32:36,850
Where could you be?

1096
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:46,640
Screw.

1097
01:32:47,380 --> 01:32:49,380
I don't fucking know.

1098
01:32:53,780 --> 01:32:54,500
Master...

1099
01:32:58,850 --> 01:32:59,570
Mass...

1100
01:32:59,570 --> 01:33:00,850
Perf...

1101
01:33:04,870 --> 01:33:05,590
Mint...

1102
01:33:05,590 --> 01:33:06,230
Maiden!

1103
01:33:06,670 --> 01:33:06,930
Maiden!

1104
01:33:07,370 --> 01:33:07,690
Serial!

1105
01:33:08,590 --> 01:33:09,450
That's a word.

1106
01:33:15,530 --> 01:33:15,970
Alright.

1107
01:33:16,990 --> 01:33:18,410
You and they don't know I'm up here.

1108
01:33:18,830 --> 01:33:20,170
Because they don't look up as well.

1109
01:33:26,280 --> 01:33:26,920
Alright, I'm here.

1110
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:29,940
Batman's here now.

1111
01:33:30,120 --> 01:33:31,120
Oh, up here.

1112
01:33:33,080 --> 01:33:38,560
Oh, that's a lot of people.

1113
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:45,200
I think it's supposed to be out here, but...

1114
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:47,300
I just want to enjoy the scenery just a little.

1115
01:33:47,300 --> 01:33:48,380
Oh, wait, maybe it is.

1116
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:49,560
Oh, it is up here.

1117
01:33:54,540 --> 01:33:55,640
Alright, up I'll go.

1118
01:33:56,280 --> 01:34:03,360
I thought it was one-way.

1119
01:34:06,980 --> 01:34:13,020
In my defense, I thought it was a one-way window.

1120
01:34:19,580 --> 01:34:23,040
Unfortunately, it was not.

1121
01:34:24,020 --> 01:34:25,400
This is our finest moment.

1122
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:27,160
That...

1123
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:30,340
...to destroy everything that claims this city.

1124
01:34:31,660 --> 01:34:33,140
Okay, I have an idea.

1125
01:34:36,740 --> 01:34:38,100
But like...

1126
01:34:38,100 --> 01:34:40,480
It requires some maneuvering.

1127
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:47,920
I don't know, maybe he freaky like that.

1128
01:34:48,160 --> 01:34:49,880
This is a glorious day.

1129
01:34:50,540 --> 01:34:52,280
Protocol 10 is in effect.

1130
01:34:52,680 --> 01:34:53,280
And soon...

1131
01:34:55,960 --> 01:34:57,160

1134
01:35:39,930 --> 01:35:41,530
I can't believe it.

1135
01:35:41,830 --> 01:35:43,870
My cat, I punched through it.

1136
01:35:44,290 --> 01:35:45,170
It's not fair.

1137
01:35:49,270 --> 01:35:51,330
I, to be fair, I thought I could punch through it.

1138
01:35:51,510 --> 01:35:52,190
I really did.

1139
01:35:53,790 --> 01:35:56,310
I really did think I could punch through that.

1140
01:36:03,770 --> 01:36:06,070
Oh my god, what the fuck do I do here?

1141
01:36:12,060 --> 01:36:13,260

Yeah.

1147
01:37:08,410 --> 01:37:10,590
He completely vanished.

1148
01:37:10,790 --> 01:37:11,950
Where could he have gone?

1149
01:37:13,050 --> 01:37:13,430
You know?

1150
01:37:15,430 --> 01:37:17,130
Where could he have gone?

01:37:19,530 --> 01:37:20,050

1152
01:37:21,650 --> 01:37:22,270

01:37:34,150 --> 01:37:35,930
This is a little harder to cheese now.

1157
01:37:42,710 --> 01:37:43,830
Okay, what if they come over?

1158
01:37:44,610 --> 01:37:45,590
Okay, watch this.

What the fuck?

1170
01:38:19,570 --> 01:38:20,070
Oh, shit!

1171
01:38:23,890 --> 01:38:25,930
Can you just do that?

1172
01:38:29,130 --> 01:38:29,970
Okay, he doesn't know.

1173
01:38:34,120 --> 01:38:36,580
Yeah, just, yeah, right.

1174
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:38,240
No, my gargoyle!

1175
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:44,180
Oh my god, he broke it!

1176
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:46,660
That's not it.

1177
01:38:46,680 --> 01:38:47,280
messed up.

1178
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:49,080
No one breaks my gargoyle!

1179
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:50,720
That's right!

1180
01:38:54,360 --> 01:38:54,960
Bam!

1181
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:56,100
Oh, God.

1182
01:38:56,340 --> 01:38:56,740
Oh, God.

1183
01:38:57,060 --> 01:38:57,480
Oh, God.

1184
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:00,360
There you go.

1185
01:39:01,900 --> 01:39:02,640
That's cheating!

1186
01:39:03,080 --> 01:39:04,540
That's my high ground!

1187
01:39:05,180 --> 01:39:08,740
A beautiful gargoyle!

1188
01:39:12,240 --> 01:39:13,120
Oh, my God!

1189
01:39:16,260 --> 01:39:17,300
That's messed up.

1190
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:18,460
That's actually messed up.

1191
01:39:20,140 --> 01:39:20,660
Watch this.

1192
01:39:26,940 --> 01:39:27,910
Your friends don't know.

1193
01:39:41,740 --> 01:39:42,600
That's right.

1194
01:39:45,660 --> 01:39:46,160
Boom!

1195
01:39:47,800 --> 01:39:48,200
That's right!

1196
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:50,320
Oh, your friends are dead!

1197
01:39:52,160 --> 01:39:52,980
Alright, we did it.

1198
01:39:53,560 --> 01:39:56,880
Can you hear me, Mr. Of course you can.

1199
01:39:57,320 --> 01:39:58,380
Broke your spy.

1200
01:40:03,940 --> 01:40:04,380
Yeah?

1201
01:40:04,980 --> 01:40:06,980
Now watch me slowly hack your thing.

1202
01:40:08,700 --> 01:40:11,420
He's like, you can't... Oh wait, wait a minute.

1203
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:16,200
That's right.

1204
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:18,700
Yeah, you're untouchable?

1205
01:40:21,700 --> 01:40:22,400
Gotham.

1206
01:40:23,240 --> 01:40:23,940
Saviour.

1207
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:26,700
You have not won.

1208
01:40:30,420 --> 01:40:31,960
Wait, stop!

1209
01:40:33,860 --> 01:40:35,960
I have saved Gotham.

1210
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:42,440
That's right.

1211
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:44,200
You're untouchable.

1212
01:40:44,580 --> 01:40:45,460
Give me a sec.

1213
01:40:46,300 --> 01:40:48,100
Let me hack this real quick.

1214
01:40:50,140 --> 01:40:51,280
That's right, nerd.

1215
01:40:51,460 --> 01:40:52,660
Get back in the locker.

1216
01:40:58,560 --> 01:40:59,540
Also, what about Joker?

1217
01:40:59,540 --> 01:41:01,980
Are we forgetting the Joker's subplot here?

1218
01:41:02,300 --> 01:41:03,720
What happened to the Super 8?

1219
01:41:05,360 --> 01:41:06,760
Look at what you've done.

1220
01:41:07,500 --> 01:41:09,940
It's glorious, isn't it?

1221
01:41:17,660 --> 01:41:19,600
You're finished, Strange.

1222
01:41:20,460 --> 01:41:22,460
One problem at a time.

1223
01:41:23,500 --> 01:41:25,580
Look, we have a lot of problems in Gotham.

1224
01:41:26,620 --> 01:41:27,920
You cannot stop me.

1225
01:41:28,380 --> 01:41:32,080
Soon I will command forces beyond your comprehension.

1226
01:41:32,440 --> 01:43:07,340

What are you doing?

1229
01:43:35,340 --> 01:43:37,400
Pass called Wayne.

1230
01:43:38,900 --> 01:43:39,780
Bro, what the fuck?

1231
01:43:39,940 --> 01:43:40,940
He used my name.

1232
01:43:41,140 --> 01:43:43,360
He's doxing me with his password.

1233
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:54,420
Order 66.

1234
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,220
God, he's so obsessed with me.

1235
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:04,220
What the fuck?

1236
01:44:08,320 --> 01:44:09,000
What?

1237
01:44:13,470 --> 01:44:47,150

1238
01:44:47,670 --> 01:44:49,610
I'm not caught you at a bad time, have I?

1239
01:44:50,110 --> 01:44:53,010
I was worried that you may have forgotten about little old me.

1240
01:44:53,630 --> 01:44:55,510
Take a look at your girlfriend.

1241
01:44:55,750 --> 01:45:02,310
Oh, as you can see, it's in danger of having your pretty little brain flattered all over this camera.

1242
01:45:02,950 --> 01:45:04,230
Ignore him, Bynid.

1243
01:45:05,010 --> 01:45:05,930
Let him die.

1244
01:45:06,870 --> 01:45:09,550
We could just put her in the fountain if she shoots her.

1245
01:45:09,590 --> 01:45:12,930
The only problem is, I've never felt better.

1246
01:45:13,470 --> 01:45:19,690
And we both know, you really can't ignore me, can you?

1247
01:45:20,190 --> 01:45:25,290
Okay, look, you're the one that called me eight times, Joker.

1248
01:45:25,910 --> 01:45:27,210
Like, it's over.

1249
01:45:28,310 --> 01:45:31,610
It's been two years, move on.

1250
01:45:33,110 --> 01:45:42,610
He wants me so bad.

Oh, God.

1255
01:46:52,740 --> 01:46:53,740
There's so many snipers.

1256
01:46:53,860 --> 01:46:54,420
I'm just going to.

1257
01:46:56,320 --> 01:46:56,960
Oh, my God.

1258
01:46:57,140 --> 01:46:58,220
What is this jigsaw?

1259
01:46:58,520 --> 01:46:59,440
Like, puzzle.

1260
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:00,400
Oh, my God.

1261
01:47:00,580 --> 01:47:02,560
The snipers are covering the snipers.

1262
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:04,060
Like, what is...

1263
01:47:04,060 --> 01:47:04,860
Oh, my God.

1264
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:05,480
Fuck this.

1265
01:47:09,830 --> 01:47:10,490
Oh, God.

1266
01:47:10,890 --> 01:47:11,330
Oh,

1267
01:47:15,870 --> 01:47:15,910
shit.

1268
01:47:16,390 --> 01:47:16,910
Oh, shit.

1269
01:47:17,590 --> 01:47:18,130
Oh, shit.

1270
01:47:19,490 --> 01:47:20,150
That's fine.

1271
01:47:21,030 --> 01:47:21,670
That's fine.

1272
01:47:22,190 --> 01:47:22,870
That's five.

1273
01:47:23,590 --> 01:47:23,810
Whoa!

1274
01:47:24,490 --> 01:47:24,490
Whoa!

1275
01:47:24,770 --> 01:47:25,690
Can't get me!

1276
01:47:26,170 --> 01:47:26,470
Whoa!

1277
01:47:29,450 --> 01:47:30,030
There you go.

1278
01:47:33,190 --> 01:47:34,370
Okay, this is bullshit, Joker.

1279
01:47:34,510 --> 01:47:36,030
Like, what is the sniper covering?

1280
01:47:36,310 --> 01:47:37,370
The sniper can't die.

1281
01:47:37,490 --> 01:47:42,370
The sniper has a sniper looking for the sniper and the sniper is looking for the sniper.

1282
01:47:50,140 --> 01:47:52,940
Oh my god, they're all covering each other!

1283
01:47:58,250 --> 01:47:58,970
That's right.

1284
01:48:00,130 --> 01:48:01,470
Don't got your gun now.

1285
01:48:02,830 --> 01:48:04,790
They got the full coverage.

1286
01:48:07,590 --> 01:48:08,650
That's got them right.

1287
01:48:12,500 --> 01:48:13,880
What you gotta do when you have no sniper?

1288
01:48:14,340 --> 01:48:14,560
Huh?

1289
01:48:15,100 --> 01:48:16,480
That was your entire plan.

1290
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:18,720
Oh my god, he got the sniper back.

1291
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:23,180
Oh my god, I'm 20 sniper rifles on me.

1292
01:48:26,060 --> 01:48:26,700
Alright, there we go.

1293
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:28,920
Now you actually can't do anything.

1294
01:48:31,340 --> 01:48:32,280
That's right.

1295
01:48:39,610 --> 01:48:40,670
That's fucking right.

1296
01:48:41,310 --> 01:48:43,170
Would he chuck a rock at me?

1297
01:48:45,370 --> 01:48:46,550
Bro, that's...

1298
01:48:47,150 --> 01:48:49,130
You're so lucky you can't...

1299
01:48:49,130 --> 01:48:50,170
You're so lucky.

1300
01:48:50,890 --> 01:48:51,830
That's it.

1301
01:48:55,430 --> 01:48:55,950
Oh, wait.

1302
01:48:56,050 --> 01:48:57,290
He just dodges that.

1303
01:49:04,760 --> 01:49:05,440
Joker, I don't know.

1304
01:49:05,540 --> 01:49:07,140
Why did you hire 80 snipers?

1305
01:49:07,720 --> 01:49:08,320
Okay.

1306
01:49:08,940 --> 01:49:12,180
You want me to get off this annoying woman, right?

1307
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:16,700
Maybe if you didn't hire 80 snipers, everything would be fine.

1308
01:49:16,860 --> 01:49:19,540
Blah, blah, blah, mystical mumbo-chumbo.

1309
01:49:20,720 --> 01:49:21,540
I'll tell you what.

1310
01:49:21,800 --> 01:49:22,840
I'll do it.

1311
01:49:23,120 --> 01:49:24,100
But you owe me.

1312
01:49:24,500 --> 01:49:25,040
Okay.

1313
01:49:25,600 --> 01:49:26,480
Oh, my God.

1314
01:49:29,160 --> 01:49:30,180
There you go.

1315
01:49:34,260 --> 01:49:37,840
They had one for every call you missed.

1316
01:49:40,420 --> 01:49:41,160
Bro, they even...

1317
01:49:41,180 --> 01:49:42,540
Covering a door?

1318
01:49:44,660 --> 01:49:46,520
Who's covering the sniper?

1319
01:49:47,580 --> 01:49:49,200
Oh my god

1320
01:49:53,500 --> 01:49:56,520
Oh my god, this is actually bullshit.

1321
01:49:56,940 --> 01:49:57,420
There's a...

1322
01:50:00,980 --> 01:50:08,880
The sniper has his own sniper body guide who has his own sniper body guide who has its own... When does it end?

1323
01:50:09,420 --> 01:50:10,900
When does it all end?

1324
01:50:11,180 --> 01:50:12,180
Oh my god.

1325
01:50:16,920 --> 01:50:20,060
When do all this end?

1326
01:50:21,240 --> 01:50:23,280
Who is the last sniper?

1327
01:50:30,040 --> 01:50:34,760
I gotta disable the sniper ring from the outside.

1328
01:50:36,140 --> 01:50:41,160
I need to find the last sniper that doesn't have a body.

1335
01:51:55,640 --> 01:51:56,880
It's right here.

1336
01:51:57,220 --> 01:51:59,940
Next to the gaffer tape and the pliers.

1337
01:52:03,100 --> 01:52:03,660

No one's covering him.

1344
01:53:08,220 --> 01:53:09,140
No one's covering him.

1345
01:53:10,320 --> 01:53:10,940
Oh my god.

1346
01:53:11,320 --> 01:53:11,880

Who was covering him?

1348
01:53:13,580 --> 01:53:14,120
Who was covering?

1349
01:53:16,320 --> 01:53:16,920
Oh!

1350
01:53:17,420 --> 01:53:23,880
I don't understand.

1351
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:26,000
I thought no one was covering him.

1352
01:53:26,920 --> 01:53:27,440
That's right.

1353
01:53:27,480 --> 01:53:27,740
You don't have to.

1354
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:28,760
I don't have a gun now.

1355
01:53:28,840 --> 01:53:30,360
I don't have to worry about you.

1356
01:53:30,360 --> 01:53:35,780
Oh my god, I need it.

1357
01:53:35,860 --> 01:53:37,660
Okay, this guy is just useless.

1358
01:53:38,980 --> 01:53:40,100
This ain't over.

1359
01:53:41,700 --> 01:53:43,960
It's no gun for you now.

1360
01:53:45,460 --> 01:53:45,860
Okay, right?

1361
01:53:46,020 --> 01:53:46,860
Get out of here.

1362
01:53:50,500 --> 01:53:51,220
There we go.

1363
01:53:51,300 --> 01:53:53,300
You don't also don't have a gun now.

1364
01:53:54,860 --> 01:53:56,660
You can't hear me, right?

1365
01:53:57,760 --> 01:54:00,160
You don't seem to be coming to the movie theater.

1366
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:04,040
I'd hate for you to read the spoilers on the internet again.

1367
01:54:04,300 --> 01:54:04,860
There you go.

1368
01:54:05,700 --> 01:54:06,780
He can throw a rock.

1369
01:54:06,880 --> 01:54:08,760
What the fuck is a rock gonna do?

1370
01:54:14,700 --> 01:54:15,220
Alright.

1371
01:54:17,240 --> 01:54:18,420
There's him over here.

1372
01:54:23,550 --> 01:54:23,970
Alright.

1373
01:54:26,530 --> 01:54:27,050

1374
01:54:30,710 --> 01:54:31,070

1382
01:55:20,280 --> 01:55:20,980
That's right.

1383
01:55:21,500 --> 01:55:22,400
Get out of here!

1384
01:55:23,080 --> 01:55:24,980
Oh wait, I did not mean to do that, but it's fine.

1385
01:55:28,320 --> 01:55:28,880
Oh shit!

1386
01:55:29,340 --> 01:55:30,200
Watch this.

1387
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:35,040
Boom!

1388
01:55:35,900 --> 01:55:36,600
There we go.

1389
01:55:39,680 --> 01:55:40,500
Take down!

1390
01:55:40,660 --> 01:55:41,920

1392
01:56:14,500 --> 01:56:15,500
We'll just put it in the fountain.

1393
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:25,560
I don't think that's the real joker anyway.

1394
01:56:26,320 --> 01:56:27,060
That's fine.

1395
01:56:30,660 --> 01:56:31,780
That's true.

1396
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:35,240
I would never have killed him.

1397
01:56:37,620 --> 01:56:38,500
Yeah, no blood.

1398
01:56:46,390 --> 01:56:48,950
He had no bones, guys.

1399
01:56:51,010 --> 01:56:52,830
Where is his bones?

1400
01:56:53,530 --> 01:56:54,830
There's no way he was there.

1401
01:56:55,390 --> 01:56:57,030
I just wanted to see if I could do it.

1402
01:56:57,050 --> 01:57:01,890
You know, I told the doctor to take out a rib, but then he took out more than just the ribs.

1403
01:57:01,910 --> 01:57:05,710
How do you keep a secret from the world's greatest detective?

1404
01:57:06,270 --> 01:57:13,340
Will do you get right in front of them right on me?

1405
01:57:13,720 --> 01:57:15,700
Joker wants you to think he's sick.

1406
01:57:16,120 --> 01:57:18,220
Then wait, gotcha.

1407
01:57:18,460 --> 01:57:20,640
You know this wasn't a mirror.

1408
01:57:21,660 --> 01:57:22,180
Yeah, see?

1409
01:57:22,340 --> 01:57:23,860
Like, he didn't even turn around.

1410
01:57:24,560 --> 01:57:24,800
Oh.

1411
01:57:26,920 --> 01:57:28,720
I'm sorry, beloved.

1412
01:57:29,420 --> 01:57:30,760
I knew it wasn't a mirror.

1413
01:57:30,940 --> 01:57:31,500
I didn't know.

1414
01:57:37,490 --> 01:57:38,130
I knew it.

1415
01:57:38,470 --> 01:57:40,690
It has to be Clayface, isn't it?

1416
01:57:40,950 --> 01:57:42,970
It was a never-heat-all.

1417
01:57:46,290 --> 01:57:50,590
I told you.

1418
01:57:50,630 --> 01:57:51,730
I'm the world's greatest detective.

1419
01:57:51,910 --> 01:57:52,550
I'm Batman.

1420
01:57:55,790 --> 01:57:57,270
He's an actor.

1421
01:57:58,870 --> 01:58:00,810
It's important to keep up...

1422
01:58:00,810 --> 01:58:03,370
Oh yeah, I know the super-aids is getting to him right now.

1423
01:58:03,730 --> 01:58:03,970
Oh.

1424
01:58:04,590 --> 01:58:06,750
But first, if you would be so...

1425
01:58:06,750 --> 01:58:08,390
I think you might need some stronger makeup.

1426
01:58:09,030 --> 01:58:10,590
And over my...

1427
01:58:10,590 --> 01:58:12,770
He's classically trained!

1428
01:58:21,270 --> 01:58:22,870
Yeah, he don't sound so good.

1429
01:58:22,890 --> 01:58:26,830
Ladies and gentlemen, for one night of...

1430
01:58:26,830 --> 01:58:29,110
standing in for yours truly.

1431
01:58:29,890 --> 01:58:30,750
Why does Clayface...

1432
01:58:30,750 --> 01:58:32,530
I guess it's like a good role to play.

1433
01:58:32,730 --> 01:58:34,830
I give you...

1434
01:58:35,770 --> 01:58:37,050
I fucking knew it.

1435
01:58:37,250 --> 01:58:38,150
It was so obvious.

1436
01:58:38,710 --> 01:58:40,070
I was like, where are his bones?

1437
01:58:41,310 --> 01:58:42,790
Why sign up with Joker?

1438
01:58:43,770 --> 01:58:43,790
Easy.

1439
01:58:45,130 --> 01:58:46,270
The role of a...

1440
01:58:46,270 --> 01:58:46,790
I knew it!

1441
01:58:46,790 --> 01:58:47,710
Yeah, see how it's gonna stay?

1442
01:58:47,790 --> 01:58:49,970
Like, why would... who would ever turn away from this role?

1443
01:58:51,230 --> 01:58:52,750
It's a great acting role.

1444
01:58:54,230 --> 01:58:55,710
You could get an Oscar.

1445
01:58:55,810 --> 01:58:57,270
He could get an E-GOT, you know?

1446
01:58:57,410 --> 01:58:59,470
The final act's just starting.

1447
01:59:00,390 --> 01:59:01,850
It's a doozy.

1448
01:59:02,470 --> 01:59:03,870
Bro, he's getting his E-GOT.

1449
01:59:04,770 --> 01:59:05,110
Oh!

1450
01:59:05,130 --> 01:59:13,450

1451
01:59:17,890 --> 01:59:40,350

1452
01:59:47,480 --> 01:59:48,080
Okay.

1453
01:59:50,920 --> 01:59:51,640
Oh, well, okay.

1454
01:59:52,020 --> 01:59:53,240
He goes doing again.

1455
01:59:55,800 --> 01:59:56,700
Oh, nice.

1456
01:59:57,760 --> 01:59:58,740
It's literally Dr. Sos.

1457
01:59:59,980 --> 02:00:00,680
Oh, my God.

1458
02:00:01,340 --> 02:00:03,420
Nobody expects that.

1459
02:00:05,960 --> 02:00:06,300
All right.

1460
02:00:06,520 --> 02:00:07,160
We're halfway there.

1461
02:00:08,920 --> 02:00:09,340
It's fine.

1462
02:00:12,580 --> 02:00:13,300
All right.

1463
02:00:16,140 --> 02:00:19,400
You wouldn't expect him to be slowing down after it, too.

1464
02:00:20,160 --> 02:00:21,000
Because that, you know.

1465
02:00:21,860 --> 02:00:22,740
He's mud.

1466
02:00:22,860 --> 02:00:23,880
He's literally made of clay.

1467
02:00:27,410 --> 02:00:27,950
Alright.

1468
02:00:28,450 --> 02:00:28,830
Nice.

1469
02:00:29,570 --> 02:00:30,950
I'll wait for him to come back up.

1470
02:00:32,850 --> 02:00:33,170
Whoa!

1471
02:00:35,690 --> 02:00:36,490
So close.

1472
02:00:36,590 --> 02:00:36,910
No!

1473
02:00:39,790 --> 02:00:40,330
Alright.

1474
02:00:41,850 --> 02:00:42,390
Dodge!

1475
02:00:44,990 --> 02:00:45,830
One more hit.

1476
02:00:46,530 --> 02:00:47,110
Nice.

1477
02:00:50,920 --> 02:00:52,180
Don't you stand around?

1478
02:00:54,300 --> 02:00:55,600
No E got for you.

1479
02:00:57,360 --> 02:00:58,060
That's right.

1480
02:01:01,800 --> 02:01:03,440
Slashy, slashy!

1481
02:01:05,240 --> 02:01:07,060
Get out of here!

1482
02:01:09,260 --> 02:01:10,640
Wait, what?

1483
02:01:10,920 --> 02:01:12,080
Wait, there's more?

1484
02:01:13,840 --> 02:01:15,320
Phase two?

1485
02:01:15,660 --> 02:01:15,720
Phase two?

1486
02:01:17,900 --> 02:01:19,160
What do you mean, phase two?

1487
02:01:22,300 --> 02:01:23,160
Oh, no.

1488
02:01:23,660 --> 02:01:24,980
Wait, he gets his HP back.

1489
02:01:25,060 --> 02:01:25,700
I don't.

1490
02:01:26,660 --> 02:01:27,540
It's not fair.

1491
02:01:29,280 --> 02:01:30,100
Oh, shit.

1492
02:01:33,120 --> 02:01:36,100
Okay, I didn't realize he was gonna...

1493
02:01:36,100 --> 02:01:36,840
Oh, my God.

1494
02:01:36,920 --> 02:01:38,140
I didn't realize there was a phase two.

1495
02:01:38,620 --> 02:01:39,460
Oh, this is bad.

1496
02:01:39,700 --> 02:01:40,840
I was poking around.

1497
02:01:41,760 --> 02:01:43,560
I was definitely not trying too hard.

1498
02:01:45,240 --> 02:01:46,280
Oh, this is bad.

1499
02:01:47,240 --> 02:01:47,880
Guys, I don't know.

1500
02:01:47,900 --> 02:01:54,280
I was not expecting a phase two, guys.

1501
02:01:55,080 --> 02:01:56,500
Oh, Batman's not doing so good.

1502
02:01:59,560 --> 02:01:59,900
Okay.

1503
02:02:02,400 --> 02:02:03,960
Okay, he rose twice now.

1504
02:02:06,640 --> 02:02:06,820
Okay.

1505
02:02:08,640 --> 02:02:09,740
Oh, shit, wait.

1506
02:02:09,940 --> 02:02:10,540
That works.

1507
02:02:13,680 --> 02:02:15,080
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1508
02:02:15,080 --> 02:02:15,680
That does not work.

1509
02:02:19,120 --> 02:02:19,760
Wait!

1510
02:02:22,100 --> 02:02:22,740
I...

1511
02:02:23,480 --> 02:02:25,540
This was the performance!

1512
02:02:26,100 --> 02:02:27,140
Okay, okay, okay.

1513
02:02:28,240 --> 02:02:31,480
I didn't realize there were ever others to it.

1514
02:02:34,220 --> 02:02:35,880
Okay, this is...

1515
02:02:35,880 --> 02:02:36,160
It's fine.

1516
02:02:36,280 --> 02:02:36,860
We got full-age.

1517
02:02:36,980 --> 02:02:38,480
We died tactically.

1518
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:41,640
Look, I didn't think...

1519
02:02:41,640 --> 02:02:44,740
I was not expecting the second hit.

1520
02:02:51,420 --> 02:02:51,860
Okay.

1521
02:02:55,260 --> 02:02:55,700
Alright.

1522
02:02:58,160 --> 02:02:58,600
Alright.

1523
02:02:59,300 --> 02:02:59,300
Nice.

1524
02:02:59,760 --> 02:03:01,780
Yeah, the second hit fucks with me.

1525
02:03:02,200 --> 02:03:03,820
I don't know if he can dodge that.

1526
02:03:05,040 --> 02:03:06,520
He dodged that second hit?

1527
02:03:09,560 --> 02:03:11,060
Because it didn't look like I can.

1528
02:03:14,950 --> 02:03:16,150
Thank god there's a checkpoint.

1529
02:03:17,570 --> 02:03:18,870
Yeah, okay, I have to...

1530
02:03:18,870 --> 02:03:20,150
Oh, I have to crouch!

1531
02:03:20,570 --> 02:03:21,590
Okay, that makes sense.

1532
02:03:23,850 --> 02:03:25,170
Sorry, it's too big.

1533
02:03:25,190 --> 02:03:30,430
I've been too busy fucking Just spam rolling.

1534
02:03:31,430 --> 02:03:31,870
Okay.

1535
02:03:32,010 --> 02:03:32,860
Wait, I could tank this

1536
02:03:36,010 --> 02:03:53,370
Yeah He's one hit There you go I freeze don't just stand around I was like get over here all

1537
02:03:56,660 --> 02:04:26,280

1538
02:04:34,260 --> 02:04:35,420
Where's Catwoman?

1539
02:04:39,330 --> 02:04:40,290
Oh, there's the fountain.

1540
02:04:43,370 --> 02:04:45,730
I just need to put Talia in here and she'll be fine.

1541
02:04:46,030 --> 02:04:49,050
A little crazy, but like, Batman likes that, apparently.

1542
02:04:50,090 --> 02:04:52,410
Batman is okay with a little crazy.

1543
02:04:56,770 --> 02:04:57,350
Okay.

1544
02:04:58,570 --> 02:05:00,330
I think Batman only dates crazy.

1545
02:05:02,950 --> 02:05:05,970
Honestly, I don't think he dates like a normal woman.

1546
02:05:09,730 --> 02:05:13,230
I don't think he's ever dated a normal person.

1547
02:05:14,230 --> 02:05:16,370
Yeah, the crazier, the better, exactly.

1548
02:05:17,150 --> 02:05:18,630
He's not here about stability.

1549
02:05:19,230 --> 02:05:20,110
He has the...

1550
02:05:20,710 --> 02:05:24,990
He's so obsessed with being like, I can fix her.

1551
02:05:25,790 --> 02:05:27,110
Because he can't fix himself.

1552
02:05:28,970 --> 02:05:31,790
He's like, if I can't fix myself, I can fix her.

1553
02:05:32,130 --> 02:05:38,570
Which is not very healthy, but I don't think a man in a bat suit is healthy in general.

1554
02:05:42,450 --> 02:05:44,330
Jesus Christ, they're just slapping me.

1555
02:05:48,210 --> 02:05:49,470
Like, don't worry.

1556
02:05:50,630 --> 02:05:50,890
Jesus.

1557
02:05:51,550 --> 02:05:51,790
Bro!

1558
02:05:55,780 --> 02:05:56,220
Yeah.

1559
02:05:57,300 --> 02:05:58,800
Got his stupid little minions.

1560
02:06:01,960 --> 02:06:03,960
I'm literally killing his little baby.

1561
02:06:03,980 --> 02:06:05,980
Come on.

1562
02:06:09,260 --> 02:06:10,740
There we go.

1563
02:06:17,510 --> 02:06:18,770
Things he'll do for an Oscar.

1564
02:06:21,810 --> 02:06:23,730
Oh my god, Batman!

1565
02:06:23,970 --> 02:06:24,850
What the fuck?

1566
02:06:25,030 --> 02:06:27,790
I know you're freaky, but not that freaky.

1567
02:06:31,870 --> 02:06:33,750
Yeah, you gotta match that freak.

1568
02:06:36,430 --> 02:06:37,810
Warming my Batman?

1569
02:06:47,980 --> 02:06:49,540
I should be okay now.

1570
02:06:49,620 --> 02:06:51,260
I'm cured from Super Aids.

1571
02:06:52,020 --> 02:06:53,900
Get out of my way, bats!

1572
02:06:54,460 --> 02:06:57,300
I've got a date with immortality!

1573
02:07:01,790 --> 02:07:02,430
Oh!

1574
02:07:09,300 --> 02:07:10,400
Oh shit!

1575
02:07:12,140 --> 02:07:13,900
Oh no, wait, Clayface?

1576
02:07:13,980 --> 02:07:15,500
Wait, does it work with Clayface?

1577
02:07:20,780 --> 02:07:25,300
I don't know if giving Clayface immortality was a better alternative.

1578
02:07:26,280 --> 02:07:26,920
Quick!

1579
02:07:27,140 --> 02:07:28,340
The cure.

1580
02:07:29,240 --> 02:07:30,840
What are you waiting for?

1581
02:07:30,840 --> 02:07:32,740
Yeah, I can use it on Talia, too.

1582
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:33,760
Your girlfriend.

1583
02:07:34,260 --> 02:07:35,920
Poison, Gotham, and hell.

1584
02:07:36,700 --> 02:07:38,420
Yeah, but he could be double immortal.

1585
02:07:38,860 --> 02:07:40,200
But so what?

1586
02:07:40,620 --> 02:07:42,960
We all know you'll save me.

1587
02:07:43,420 --> 02:07:46,880
Every decision you've ever made ends with death and misery.

1588
02:07:48,180 --> 02:07:49,280
People die.

1589
02:07:50,260 --> 02:07:51,040
I stop you.

1590
02:07:51,080 --> 02:07:53,480
Yeah, but he can be double immortal, guys.

1591
02:07:53,820 --> 02:07:54,720
Do it again.

1592
02:07:55,140 --> 02:08:00,080
He could be immortal, Whoa, shit!

1593
02:08:00,860 --> 02:08:02,760
Bro, you fucking idiot, Joker!

1594
02:08:04,360 --> 02:08:06,920
Boy, it's okay, you can lick the floor.

1595
02:08:07,300 --> 02:08:08,660
Oh, no, Joker.

1596
02:08:09,060 --> 02:08:09,880
That's sad.

1597
02:08:10,920 --> 02:08:12,380
Oh, Joker.

1598
02:08:12,860 --> 02:08:13,480
You.

1599
02:08:13,840 --> 02:08:15,960
That is so sad.

1600
02:08:16,100 --> 02:08:17,480
Bro, what do you mean, am I happy?

1601
02:08:17,600 --> 02:08:19,560
You fucking sad me!

1602
02:08:23,180 --> 02:08:31,700
Bro, he's like, like the bicycle meme in sticks like how dare you batman he sticks a stick on his own bicycle

1603
02:08:42,980 --> 02:08:45,360
that's actually pretty funny

1604
02:08:48,620 --> 02:08:50,560
why would batman do this

1605
02:08:54,110 --> 02:08:56,670
oh at least he died happy

1606
02:09:00,670 --> 02:09:02,310
I don't get it.

1607
02:09:03,170 --> 02:09:04,450
Can you just keep licking the floor?

1608
02:09:07,270 --> 02:09:07,570
Aww.

1609
02:09:08,870 --> 02:09:10,490
His super aids was too strong.

1610
02:09:15,370 --> 02:09:16,590
Is he okay?

1611
02:09:17,770 --> 02:09:19,810
I guess you think he's okay.

1612
02:09:23,130 --> 02:09:24,470
Oh, that's so romantic.

1613
02:09:38,830 --> 02:09:40,110
You got princess carried.

1614
02:09:51,660 --> 02:09:53,360
What the hell happened in there?

1615
02:10:00,330 --> 02:10:01,290
Yeah, but...

1616
02:10:01,290 --> 02:10:05,830
The thing is with Joker dying, it leaves a power vacuum in Gotham.

1617
02:10:08,790 --> 02:10:09,910
That's the issue.

1618
02:10:11,690 --> 02:10:16,890
Now that all the villains know that Joker is dead, they're like, I'll be the next king of...

1619
02:10:17,370 --> 02:10:18,490
King of Gotham.

1620
02:10:25,020 --> 02:10:26,220
It'll be fine, right?

1621
02:10:26,480 --> 02:10:27,420
It'll be fine.

1622
02:10:32,580 --> 02:10:33,960
Absolutely, thank you for the super chat.

1623
02:10:34,020 --> 02:10:34,720

1628
02:11:12,100 --> 02:11:13,400

1629
02:11:13,820 --> 02:11:16,740
If I do do the DLC, how long is the DLC?

1630
02:11:18,760 --> 02:11:19,640
What's the order?

1631
02:11:19,860 --> 02:11:21,580
What's the order of the Arkham series?

1632
02:11:23,400 --> 02:11:24,040
One hour?

1633
02:11:25,540 --> 02:11:28,420
Okay, if it's one hour, we can do it right away.

1634
02:11:30,100 --> 02:11:31,760
Arkham Origins or Nightnecks.

1635
02:11:31,940 --> 02:11:32,900
What should be the order?

1636
02:11:38,180 --> 02:12:36,720

I swear to God, if this is my ex, you're dead.

1638
02:12:40,680 --> 02:12:41,980
You cannot do this to me.

1639
02:12:50,320 --> 02:12:52,380
Oh, he had to have one last laugh.

1640
02:12:53,460 --> 02:12:56,280
He had to give me one last trauma for the ride.

1641
02:13:11,760 --> 02:13:14,220
Don't worry, all my Batman streams have been hit by copyright.

1642
02:13:18,800 --> 02:13:19,840
Oh, my God.

1643
02:13:20,180 --> 02:13:21,840
How are you still so obsessed with me?

1644
02:13:21,960 --> 02:13:22,380
You're dead.

1645
02:13:23,040 --> 02:13:25,740
How do you leave one final voice message?

1646
02:13:36,060 --> 02:13:38,700
It's the most toxic of toxic yaoi.

1647
02:13:42,600 --> 02:13:43,720
Origins is December.

1648
02:13:43,880 --> 02:13:45,020
You want to start it next month?

1649
02:13:45,100 --> 02:13:46,000
Thank you, the super chat.

1650
02:13:46,080 --> 02:13:46,980
Thank you, thank you.

1651
02:13:56,370 --> 02:13:57,250
Only me.

1652
02:13:59,030 --> 02:13:59,910
Only me.

1653
02:14:01,950 --> 02:14:05,650
He is dead, but I know, like, Bruce is haunted by the death of his axe.

1654
02:14:07,010 --> 02:14:09,050
Because he was, like, the one that got away, you know?

1655
02:14:09,530 --> 02:14:12,210
He's like, no one could ever compare to you, Joker.

1656
02:14:12,950 --> 02:14:14,250
All of these women.

1657
02:14:14,470 --> 02:14:16,870
I try to replace you with all of these women.

1658
02:14:17,350 --> 02:14:19,450
But they'll never be compared to you.

1659
02:14:22,250 --> 02:14:25,450
He closes his eyes and he still thinks about the Junkler.

1660
02:14:45,330 --> 02:14:45,830
It's true.

1661
02:14:46,010 --> 02:14:49,530
Like, literally, he's singing a love song to me, chat.

1662
02:14:52,590 --> 02:14:54,890
He's literally fucking singing a love song.

1663
02:14:56,730 --> 02:14:58,930
Golden Foxy, think of a super chat, think of a thing.

1664
02:14:59,970 --> 02:15:13,830
short but it depends on how good you do on the final bus okay it's all okay how much stealth is the dlc also is there an is there a secret end is there a after credit scene chat oh hey nvidia

1665
02:15:22,270 --> 02:15:33,530
one stealth section is there an after credit scene yeah okay we gotta wait then marshall they even super chat they could thank you no woman can be as crazy as joker and that's

1666
02:15:36,930 --> 02:15:40,090
He was the ultimate I can fix her.

1667
02:15:41,470 --> 02:15:42,290
No one can.

1668
02:15:42,750 --> 02:15:45,030
He always chases that high.

1669
02:15:48,310 --> 02:15:51,270
He's been chasing that high since the Joker died.

1670
02:15:52,170 --> 02:15:57,130
He's like, if only I can fix you, like I can fix the Joker.

1671
02:16:02,060 --> 02:16:02,920
Did we skip this?

1672
02:16:03,060 --> 02:16:04,520
Oh, you can skip the credits now?

1673
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:05,300
Okay.

1674
02:16:08,900 --> 02:16:09,960
I'll turn it.

1675
02:16:09,980 --> 02:16:12,140
Alternative Batman outfits.

1676
02:16:22,860 --> 02:16:25,920
Time to get my things and quit this damn town for good.

1677
02:16:26,020 --> 02:16:26,740
Wait, is this a DLC?

1678
02:16:28,040 --> 02:16:29,060
Wait, am I in it?

1679
02:16:29,160 --> 02:16:32,740
Did it just put me in it now?

1680
02:16:34,020 --> 02:16:35,680
Wait, am I in the DLC already?

1681
02:16:39,630 --> 02:16:40,350
Is this it?

1682
02:16:41,790 --> 02:16:43,650
Oh, okay, it added me right there.

1683
02:16:43,990 --> 02:16:44,190
Alright.

1684
02:16:49,410 --> 02:16:50,910
Then what's this part?

1685
02:16:51,350 --> 02:16:52,910
Why do I have to retrieve and...

1686
02:16:52,910 --> 02:16:53,550
Oh, I have to leave.

1687
02:16:53,590 --> 02:16:54,750
Okay, let her leave first.

1688
02:16:55,350 --> 02:16:58,590
Alright, we're gonna leave Arkham City and move to Metropolis, I guess.

1689
02:17:00,970 --> 02:17:03,130
This is still the main game?

1690
02:17:05,550 --> 02:17:06,530
Oh, it's short.

1691
02:17:06,650 --> 02:17:06,890
Okay.

1692
02:17:09,590 --> 02:17:10,050
Alright.

1693
02:17:10,870 --> 02:17:14,570
We're gonna go move to Metropolis after I get her loot.

1694
02:17:17,230 --> 02:17:18,750
Shit, my hideout is right here.

1695
02:17:20,130 --> 02:17:22,490
Remember how to live, how...

1696
02:17:24,830 --> 02:17:26,010
Where's my house?

1697
02:17:26,250 --> 02:17:26,950
Oh, there it is.

1698
02:17:28,890 --> 02:17:30,550
Home sweet home.

1699
02:17:32,150 --> 02:17:32,590
No!

1700
02:17:38,580 --> 02:17:39,540
I've been found!

1701
02:17:41,200 --> 02:17:42,820
Wait, my cats are in there.

1702
02:17:42,960 --> 02:17:43,640
What the fuck?

1703
02:17:43,740 --> 02:17:44,960
Who the fuck killed my...

1704
02:17:45,640 --> 02:17:47,420
My cats are in there!

1705
02:17:50,180 --> 02:17:51,020
Oh, shit.

1706
02:17:51,060 --> 02:17:52,360
Wait, this is not good.

1707
02:17:52,600 --> 02:17:53,380
Hang on.

1708
02:17:53,700 --> 02:17:54,560
She's waking up.

1709
02:17:54,980 --> 02:17:55,400
Damn it.

1710
02:17:55,460 --> 02:17:56,240
What are we gonna do?

1711
02:17:57,020 --> 02:17:57,980
Kill her again.

1712
02:17:59,040 --> 02:17:59,700
Excuse me?

1713
02:18:00,200 --> 02:18:01,520
Um, no, you do not.

1714
02:18:02,960 --> 02:18:03,740
No, you do not.

1715
02:18:03,860 --> 02:18:04,920
This is for my cats.

1716
02:18:05,580 --> 02:18:06,020
Bitch.

1717
02:18:06,500 --> 02:18:06,940
Oh, shit.

1718
02:18:09,440 --> 02:18:09,780
That's fine.

1719
02:18:09,880 --> 02:18:10,460
I'll just keep hitting.

1720
02:18:11,640 --> 02:18:13,600
Okay, maybe I should have given you some upgrades.

1721
02:18:16,280 --> 02:18:19,140
I feel like you have, like, you're so weak right now.

1722
02:18:21,760 --> 02:18:24,100
I definitely should have given you some upgrades.

1723
02:18:27,360 --> 02:18:28,120
Oh, my God.

1724
02:18:28,220 --> 02:18:29,500
You have no HP, too.

1725
02:18:29,580 --> 02:18:30,660
I forgot about that.

1726
02:18:32,020 --> 02:18:32,800
I can't even...

1727
02:18:32,800 --> 02:18:36,080
Bro, I can't even do, like, finishers because there's so many people here.

1728
02:18:37,800 --> 02:18:39,180
Like, bro, he just slapped me.

1729
02:18:39,220 --> 02:18:41,000
He's like, I can't let my bro...

1730
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,900
If I can't have a good time, you can't have a good time.

1731
02:18:45,920 --> 02:18:47,740
Yeah, I can't do finishers on them.

1732
02:18:49,940 --> 02:18:51,600
That's like, Watch out, watch out!

1733
02:18:55,530 --> 02:18:55,970
Okay.

1734
02:18:58,710 --> 02:18:59,850
Where are my things?

1735
02:19:00,170 --> 02:19:00,750
Yeah.

1736
02:19:02,650 --> 02:19:03,550
I think...

1737
02:19:03,550 --> 02:19:10,190
I think Arkham Catwoman has to have the best Catwoman design.

1738
02:19:13,170 --> 02:19:16,950
Arkham Catwoman is the best design-wise of the outfit.

1739
02:19:18,790 --> 02:19:19,370
Oh well.

1740
02:19:19,690 --> 02:19:21,830
Time for this kitten to teach you some manners.

1741
02:19:22,130 --> 02:19:23,510
Once and for all.

1742
02:19:27,510 --> 02:19:30,150
Because like, before then, Catwoman didn't look like that.

1743
02:19:30,170 --> 02:19:55,770
Catwoman didn't have this out like before then catwoman didn't look like that I remember and then like after Arkham after Arkham they they changed Serena into like this outfit as the main outfit No before before they did this outfit for Arkham it was a different it was like more like the more like the what was it the the movie catwoman outfit

1744
02:20:08,640 --> 02:20:09,360
Here?

1745
02:20:09,840 --> 02:20:10,720
Where is this?

1746
02:20:11,080 --> 02:20:11,580
Oh, it's here.

1747
02:20:13,120 --> 02:20:14,460
No, it's not!

1748
02:20:15,540 --> 02:20:15,540
Whoa!

1749
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:17,680
Whoa!

1750
02:20:19,420 --> 02:20:19,660
Whoa!

1751
02:20:21,200 --> 02:20:22,520
Time to climb up!

1752
02:20:23,260 --> 02:20:24,300
Yeah, with Halbury.

1753
02:20:25,080 --> 02:20:25,320
Yeah.

1754
02:20:32,220 --> 02:20:41,820
Yeah, because I remembered, like, it was because of Arkham that everyone now associates uh catwoman's outfit like this now

1755
02:20:48,080 --> 02:21:35,040
it's like how what was it the new what what movie was it the suicide squad for uh uh for harley quinn i don't like i i'm so sad about that you know like the new modern the new harley quinn outfit because of suicide squad ever since suicide squad like the harley Quinn's outfit is is that outfit now like in every adaptation and that's I don't know I think it sucks it's a cat woman because like it's a good outfit but I do miss the classic Harley like the Harley Quinn outfit it is a good outfit I just do miss like you know the clown aesthetic versus like the ice cream how

1756
02:21:45,330 --> 02:21:47,890
the fuck do I get there oh it's up here

1757
02:21:52,840 --> 02:21:54,660
My HP is not doing so well.

1758
02:21:55,040 --> 02:21:56,320
Catwoman's here!

1759
02:21:57,420 --> 02:21:57,600
Eh.

1760
02:22:03,940 --> 02:22:05,500
They were like chilling.

1761
02:22:05,940 --> 02:22:07,540
They were just chilling with the homies.

1762
02:22:14,640 --> 02:22:16,920
I liked how they were all just hanging out.

1763
02:22:17,240 --> 02:22:18,840
I just came over here.

1764
02:22:20,740 --> 02:22:22,960
God, I wish your finishers were a little faster though.

1765
02:22:28,200 --> 02:22:29,620
Don't worry, he's not gonna throw this, right?

1766
02:22:33,770 --> 02:22:34,210
Yeah,

1767
02:22:39,900 --> 02:22:42,400
it's just, no, it's like pigtails, Harley Quinn now.

1768
02:22:43,520 --> 02:22:44,140
Open door.

1769
02:22:46,780 --> 02:22:49,040
Do I have the XP to lower up?

1770
02:22:49,420 --> 02:22:50,380
God, I hope so.

1771
02:22:50,960 --> 02:22:51,820
I don't think I do.

1772
02:22:55,560 --> 02:22:56,200
Yeah I don't.

1773
02:22:56,280 --> 02:22:57,520
I used it all up on.

1774
02:22:58,140 --> 02:22:59,320
Yeah, I know I don't.

1775
02:23:04,950 --> 02:23:05,910
Where's her loot?

1776
02:23:07,490 --> 02:23:08,550
I don't know.

1777
02:23:08,730 --> 02:23:09,810
I thought I knew was here.

1778
02:23:14,590 --> 02:23:18,910
Call it two faces, other face, dokey girl, or bird woman.

1779
02:23:19,110 --> 02:23:19,810
Thank you, the super chat.

1780
02:23:19,890 --> 02:23:21,290
Thank you, thank you, man.

1781
02:23:24,210 --> 02:23:24,610
Wait.

1782
02:23:26,030 --> 02:23:26,890
Where do I go?

1783
02:23:28,110 --> 02:23:29,210
I had to go here.

1784
02:23:34,390 --> 02:23:35,250
Not here?

1785
02:23:40,880 --> 02:23:41,780
How come...

1786
02:23:41,780 --> 02:23:42,380
Where's my...

1787
02:23:42,380 --> 02:23:44,180
Where's my exclamation point?

1788
02:23:46,560 --> 02:23:47,940
Oh, I have to explore.

1789
02:23:48,120 --> 02:23:48,760
I was gonna say.

1790
02:23:49,540 --> 02:23:51,780
Where the fuck is my exclamation point?

1791
02:23:55,020 --> 02:23:57,640
Oh, I like my non-bat vision.

1792
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:05,480
Just casually walk up.

1793
02:24:08,880 --> 02:24:11,820
Just casually walk up and be like, hey guys.

1794
02:24:12,620 --> 02:24:14,640
I don't know what I'm supposed to do here.

1795
02:24:19,580 --> 02:24:19,960
Oh, there you go.

1796
02:24:20,140 --> 02:24:20,900
Pounce attack.

1797
02:24:22,260 --> 02:24:24,280
I mean, you just throw this?

1798
02:24:24,320 --> 02:24:25,680
Do you think they'll know if I throw this?

1799
02:24:37,120 --> 02:24:37,420
Whoa!

1800
02:24:40,540 --> 02:24:41,620
There you go.

1801
02:24:45,230 --> 02:24:45,810
There you go.

1802
02:24:46,170 --> 02:24:47,150
That works, too.

1803
02:24:48,990 --> 02:24:50,070
That works.

1804
02:24:51,990 --> 02:24:52,370
Bam!

1805
02:24:54,050 --> 02:24:54,950
Oh, shit.

1806
02:24:55,670 --> 02:24:56,930
Bro, you punched a lady?

1807
02:24:58,250 --> 02:24:59,150
Ladies, first!

1808
02:25:01,850 --> 02:25:02,610
Oh, my God.

1809
02:25:02,870 --> 02:25:03,550
My HP is not good.

1810
02:25:03,710 --> 02:25:05,190
My HP is not good right now.

1811
02:25:11,380 --> 02:25:12,280
Okay, there you go.

1812
02:25:12,680 --> 02:25:15,280
I just gotta make sure I...

1813
02:25:15,280 --> 02:25:16,980
Oh my god, this is not good.

1814
02:25:20,300 --> 02:25:21,040
Thank you.

1815
02:25:21,420 --> 02:25:22,920
I made it.

1816
02:25:24,620 --> 02:25:29,920
I know he's like getting his shit beat up, but he's like, bro, nice outfit, bro.

1817
02:25:31,980 --> 02:25:32,420
Agreed.

1818
02:25:35,860 --> 02:25:39,280
At least they agree to have a kick-ass outfit.

1819
02:25:41,860 --> 02:25:43,340
Oh, he's still in here?

1820
02:25:43,480 --> 02:25:45,000
What the hell are you supposed to be?

1821
02:25:49,360 --> 02:25:51,060
Okay, if you insist.

1822
02:25:52,300 --> 02:25:53,760
Oh, I forgot to say.

1823
02:25:54,240 --> 02:25:55,300
Speak to me like that again.

1824
02:25:55,420 --> 02:25:56,740
Yeah, he fit checked me.

1825
02:25:56,880 --> 02:25:59,420
He's like, bro, I might be a goon, but...

1826
02:25:59,420 --> 02:26:01,420
Bird to be torn apart by a cat.

1827
02:26:01,620 --> 02:26:05,200
I- I'm here to- I know when it's a good fit.

1828
02:26:05,580 --> 02:26:06,780
That's much nicer.

1829
02:26:07,140 --> 02:26:07,380
See?

1830
02:26:07,780 --> 02:26:09,120
You can be nice, Oswald.

1831
02:26:09,940 --> 02:26:10,860
See you around.

1832
02:26:12,860 --> 02:26:14,620
He's got an eye for fashion.

1833
02:26:15,260 --> 02:26:15,260
Yeah.

1834
02:26:20,220 --> 02:26:20,660
Yeah.

1835
02:26:22,380 --> 02:26:24,080
I guess I'll just keep going.

1836
02:26:25,380 --> 02:26:26,920
Oh my god, that's a lot of people.

1837
02:26:27,020 --> 02:26:28,080
I don't know if I can.

1838
02:26:29,440 --> 02:26:32,120
Yeah, don't think I've ever seen the boss so happy.

1839
02:26:32,900 --> 02:26:34,620

13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23.

1861
02:29:27,640 --> 02:29:28,160
Oh my god.

1862
02:29:28,760 --> 02:29:29,720
Kicks for days.

1863
02:29:30,840 --> 02:29:32,280
Actually, kicks for days.

1864
02:29:34,880 --> 02:29:35,240
Oh my god.

1865
02:29:35,340 --> 02:29:37,020
This guy ruined my fucking combo.

1866
02:29:41,060 --> 02:29:41,880
God damn.

1867
02:29:42,060 --> 02:29:42,480
I had some.

1868
02:29:42,500 --> 02:29:44,060
That's a sick-ass combo, too.

1869
02:29:46,760 --> 02:29:47,040
Okay.

1870
02:29:47,680 --> 02:29:48,120
Oh, my God.

1871
02:29:48,340 --> 02:29:49,460
I should have upgraded Catwoman.

1872
02:29:52,480 --> 02:29:53,700
I should have...

1873
02:29:53,700 --> 02:29:55,680
Guys, I definitely should have upgraded Catwoman.

1874
02:29:56,020 --> 02:30:00,020
How the fuck was I supposed to know she had this goddamn storyline?

1875
02:30:03,820 --> 02:30:05,160
I gave her nothing.

1876
02:30:05,660 --> 02:30:07,020
I didn't feed her.

1877
02:30:12,570 --> 02:30:13,430
Oh, my God.

1878
02:30:13,470 --> 02:30:14,270
I did not expect that.

1879
02:30:17,490 --> 02:30:18,010
Okay.

1880
02:30:19,630 --> 02:30:20,510
Alright, there we go.

1881
02:30:21,710 --> 02:30:22,350
There we go, last guy.

1882
02:30:22,650 --> 02:30:23,450
Oh, not last guy.

1883
02:30:25,370 --> 02:30:26,250
Alright, last guy.

1884
02:30:26,910 --> 02:30:27,530
Watch me whip.

1885
02:30:28,290 --> 02:30:29,290
That's right, watch me whip!

1886
02:30:30,010 --> 02:30:30,690
That's right!

1887
02:30:31,670 --> 02:30:32,610
I'm a woman.

1888
02:30:33,630 --> 02:30:34,330
Listen to me.

1889
02:30:34,550 --> 02:30:38,970
That's right, give me your lunch money.

1890
02:30:39,710 --> 02:30:40,050
Hachat!

1891
02:30:41,190 --> 02:30:42,030
You know what?

1892
02:30:42,450 --> 02:30:43,050
Full ass!

1893
02:30:43,230 --> 02:30:44,030
Full ass!

1894
02:30:44,270 --> 02:30:44,910
Full ass!

1895
02:30:48,050 --> 02:30:48,770
Okay.

1896
02:30:50,690 --> 02:30:52,490
It's not there.

1897
02:30:55,710 --> 02:31:02,190
This is a dev's reward for not leveling up cat women during this story.

1898
02:31:02,750 --> 02:31:03,830
Thank you for the super chat.

1899
02:31:04,150 --> 02:31:04,750
Thank you.

1900
02:31:04,750 --> 02:31:05,350
Thank you.

1901
02:31:05,450 --> 02:31:09,410
How the fuck was I supposed to know that?

1902
02:31:11,370 --> 02:31:12,490
Why do I get out of here?

1903
02:31:13,810 --> 02:31:15,290
Bro, they have shockwaves.

1904
02:31:17,150 --> 02:31:18,870
Wait, how do I open this?

1905
02:31:19,030 --> 02:31:20,090
I'm just a cat.

1906
02:31:23,130 --> 02:31:23,530
Oh.

1907
02:31:24,370 --> 02:31:25,470
Like, oh, it's here.

1908
02:31:25,590 --> 02:31:26,690
Okay, I stood through here.

1909
02:31:27,410 --> 02:31:28,210
Wait, I could have just...

1910
02:31:28,210 --> 02:31:28,750
Oh, my God.

1911
02:31:28,910 --> 02:31:30,790
I could have just ran away from this, guys.

1912
02:31:32,230 --> 02:31:32,750
Oh, my God.

1913
02:31:32,830 --> 02:31:33,910
I didn't even have to fight this.

1914
02:31:34,130 --> 02:31:35,450
I literally could have just ran away.

1915
02:31:38,470 --> 02:31:39,750
I can't believe it.

1916
02:31:39,890 --> 02:31:40,850
I got baited.

1917
02:31:43,170 --> 02:31:44,910
I could have just ran away.

1918
02:31:46,130 --> 02:31:48,330
Yeah, but this is cool.

1919
02:31:50,810 --> 02:31:53,230
Yeah, but at least you get XP, Doki.

1920
02:31:59,280 --> 02:32:02,820
Doki spamming low-kick, master gamer.

1921
02:32:02,980 --> 02:32:04,380
Thank you for the super chat, Kweezy.

1922
02:32:04,460 --> 02:32:05,820
Thank you, thank you.

1923
02:32:08,160 --> 02:32:09,480
Wait, R-T-A?

1924
02:32:12,480 --> 02:32:13,780
Oh, okay.

1925
02:32:15,480 --> 02:32:17,620
Wait, how am I even supposed to get anywhere here?

1926
02:32:21,830 --> 02:32:23,590
Oh, yeah, never mind.

1927
02:32:26,910 --> 02:32:27,390
Never mind.

1928
02:32:29,730 --> 02:32:30,330
I don't know.

1929
02:32:30,410 --> 02:32:32,150
I assume, like, I don't know.

1930
02:32:32,870 --> 02:32:34,890
I thought it was ice for some reason.

1931
02:32:35,890 --> 02:32:36,850
What the fuck?

1932
02:32:42,040 --> 02:32:43,140
Anywhere I can crawl?

1933
02:32:51,900 --> 02:32:53,060
Climb the ceiling?

1934
02:32:55,240 --> 02:32:56,360
Oh, there we go.

1935
02:32:57,460 --> 02:32:58,380
Oh, there we go.

1936
02:33:02,710 --> 02:33:03,150
Nice.

1937
02:33:03,330 --> 02:33:04,030
Really need this?

1938
02:33:04,550 --> 02:33:04,950
Batman.

1939
02:33:08,230 --> 02:33:09,710
Yeah, about that.

1940
02:33:11,370 --> 02:33:13,390
I wonder how my boots work for this.

1941
02:33:14,910 --> 02:33:23,610
Like, I understand, because, like, I don't actually, like, I guess my special power is that I have cat powers, but, like, um, cat, I I don't know.

1942
02:33:23,830 --> 02:33:28,570
From what I remembered, I don't think cats can crawl on ceilings, but I'm not sure.

1943
02:33:28,750 --> 02:33:29,650
I don't own a cat.

1944
02:33:29,930 --> 02:33:33,390
Any cat owners can fact-check for me, guys?

1945
02:33:33,390 --> 02:33:41,130
I don't know, I don't own a cat.

1946
02:33:43,790 --> 02:33:48,710
But maybe it's because I don't own a cat, so I've never seen a cat crawl on the ceiling before.

1947
02:33:50,170 --> 02:33:51,130
Oh, yeah, cats can do it.

1948
02:33:51,130 --> 02:33:51,530
Oh, I knew.

1949
02:33:51,870 --> 02:33:53,550
Yeah, cats can do it.

1950
02:33:54,910 --> 02:33:55,170
Hello.

1951
02:33:59,430 --> 02:34:00,250

Oh, Shazp, who's this?

1954
02:34:39,740 --> 02:34:42,600
I'm looking forward to it, sir.

1955
02:34:43,020 --> 02:34:43,020
Good.

1956
02:34:43,720 --> 02:34:45,420
This is our chance for glory.

1957
02:34:46,020 --> 02:34:47,860
Word is Joker's dead.

1958
02:34:48,320 --> 02:34:52,580
We all saw what happened to the rut that used to run this place.

1959
02:34:53,500 --> 02:34:54,400
Whoa, what happened?

1960
02:34:55,820 --> 02:34:57,440
Yeah, see the power vacuum.

1961
02:34:57,880 --> 02:34:59,320
We are the future of Gotham.

1962
02:34:59,380 --> 02:35:00,320
That's what I'm saying.

1963
02:35:00,420 --> 02:35:01,640
It's the power vacuum.

1964
02:35:01,940 --> 02:35:03,600
You dare stand up to us.

1965
02:35:03,600 --> 02:35:18,940
I think I know he sees me.

1966
02:35:25,040 --> 02:35:26,380
Or if I just slowly.

1967
02:35:30,860 --> 02:35:31,480
Yeah?

1968
02:35:32,500 --> 02:35:33,140

It kind of worked

1972
02:36:21,620 --> 02:36:24,340
Word is Joker's dead.

1973
02:36:24,860 --> 02:36:44,240
We all saw what happened to the run that used to run this place We are the future of Arkham we are the future of Gotham No one will dare stand up to us, because if they do, we'll cut them in two.

1974
02:36:44,500 --> 02:36:45,480
I'm gonna do it again.

1975
02:36:45,640 --> 02:36:46,980
He's gonna come over.

1976
02:36:49,040 --> 02:36:49,560

Oh my god!

1984
02:37:20,940 --> 02:37:22,020
Wait, that's not fair!

1985
02:37:23,840 --> 02:37:25,080
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

1986
02:37:25,340 --> 02:37:26,980
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1987
02:37:27,880 --> 02:37:29,040
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Whoa, whoa, Somersault!

1989
02:37:36,070 --> 02:37:36,730
That's right.

1990
02:37:37,630 --> 02:37:38,730
Still lost her.

1991
02:37:38,870 --> 02:37:39,310
Oh, shit!

1992
02:37:39,850 --> 02:37:41,350
Bro, bro, bro!

1993
02:37:43,490 --> 02:37:44,710
No, I'm not.

1994
02:37:45,990 --> 02:37:46,830
Oh, shit!

1995
02:37:49,390 --> 02:37:49,950
Quickly!

1996
02:37:50,290 --> 02:37:52,970
She's slowly somersaulting away.

1997
02:37:56,830 --> 02:37:57,830
Okay, okay, okay.

1998
02:37:57,910 --> 02:37:58,630
I got this.

1999
02:37:58,690 --> 02:38:00,050
I got this, guys.

2000
02:38:09,460 --> 02:38:11,520
Okay, I have an idea, guys.

2001
02:38:11,740 --> 02:38:12,340
I have an idea.

2002
02:38:12,460 --> 02:38:13,200
I know what to do.

2003
02:38:14,140 --> 02:38:15,340
Guys, I have an idea.

2004
02:38:15,760 --> 02:38:17,340
I'm looking forward to it.

2005
02:38:17,340 --> 02:38:18,400
So what I do?

2006
02:38:18,560 --> 02:38:20,100
Watch this, watch this, watch this.

2007
02:38:20,140 --> 02:38:21,120
This is our chance for glory.

2008
02:38:21,700 --> 02:38:23,100
Word is Joker's...

2009
02:38:25,880 --> 02:38:27,760
Oh my god.

2010
02:38:29,820 --> 02:38:30,640
There you go.

2011
02:38:31,060 --> 02:38:31,740
There you go.

2012
02:38:31,860 --> 02:38:32,080
And then...

2013
02:38:37,040 --> 02:38:38,880
Okay, we get him out of here.

2014
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:39,780
And then...

2015
02:38:39,780 --> 02:38:40,240
Get him!

2016
02:38:40,240 --> 02:38:40,500
Get him!

2017
02:38:40,760 --> 02:38:41,060
Yeah!

2018
02:38:43,820 --> 02:38:44,520
That's it!

2019
02:38:44,740 --> 02:38:45,980
I told you!

2020
02:38:46,280 --> 02:38:47,980
You just gotta quick smash it.

2021
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:51,820
Now tell me where you've hidden the rest of my stuff or I'll even out the other side of your face.

2022
02:38:52,880 --> 02:38:53,440
Look at it.

2023
02:38:53,840 --> 02:38:54,920
It's that easy.

2024
02:38:55,120 --> 02:38:55,380
I don't know.

2025
02:38:55,400 --> 02:38:56,540
I don't need no upgrades.

2026
02:38:57,940 --> 02:38:58,880
It worked.

2027
02:38:59,500 --> 02:39:01,100
Enough with the twos already.

2028
02:39:02,880 --> 02:39:03,440
Damn.

2029
02:39:04,100 --> 02:39:05,500
My nuclear punches.

2030
02:39:06,300 --> 02:39:08,020
It just keeps getting you into trouble.

2031
02:39:12,480 --> 02:39:13,600
I told you guys.

2032
02:39:13,760 --> 02:39:14,840
I told you it works.

2033
02:39:15,020 --> 02:39:15,700
I just had to...

2034
02:39:15,700 --> 02:39:17,600
I just had to not be silent.

2035
02:39:18,280 --> 02:39:20,620
I just gotta do like the fucking brute force.

2036
02:39:22,380 --> 02:39:23,040
The boom.

2037
02:39:23,920 --> 02:39:24,580

You can't say I blame you.

2041
02:39:33,200 --> 02:39:34,980
There's still work to do here in Arkham City.

2042
02:39:35,780 --> 02:39:36,580
Good luck with that.

2043
02:39:37,240 --> 02:39:40,640
Some enterprising individuals decided to help themselves to my things.

2044
02:39:41,280 --> 02:39:43,340

2079
02:44:06,180 --> 02:44:07,560
It's only new game plus.

2080
02:44:18,230 --> 02:44:20,610

2081
02:44:21,110 --> 02:44:21,900

2084
02:44:26,310 --> 02:44:28,890
Harley's telling the cops she's got some sort of plan for them.

2085
02:44:29,810 --> 02:44:31,010
They'll be safe for now.

2086
02:44:31,490 --> 02:44:32,090
Be careful.

2087
02:44:32,550 --> 02:44:33,350
This will end okay.

2098
02:45:00,690 --> 02:45:01,770

2099
02:45:05,470 --> 02:45:06,950

2100
02:45:07,390 --> 02:45:08,290

But it's like...

2112
02:45:59,410 --> 02:46:01,610
It's like my new brain worm right now.

2113
02:46:02,470 --> 02:46:05,410
Like, what's that word where it's like a quote that's always in your head?

2114
02:46:08,310 --> 02:46:10,570
It's like my new vocal tick.

2115
02:46:10,830 --> 02:46:11,610
Is that what it's called?

2116
02:46:12,770 --> 02:46:13,690
Also, my chat died.

02:46:13,930 --> 02:46:14,270

2121
02:46:25,190 --> 02:46:26,430
It's the new vocal stim.

2122
02:46:29,290 --> 02:46:30,910
I can't hack things.

2123
02:46:31,010 --> 02:46:32,170
I'm not smart enough.

2124
02:46:38,930 --> 02:46:40,090
How do I do this?

2125
02:46:41,790 --> 02:46:42,150
Oh.

2126
02:46:45,230 --> 02:46:46,910
Yeah, thank you, welcome to the channel.

2127
02:46:46,930 --> 02:47:17,150
Manifan welcome welcome just saw you on the Marvel rivals oh did they announce it who would have expected that I feel like every time I'm like a secret sponsor can announce it and everyone knows it's rivals oh my god bro okay I have to talk about this but I saw on the rivals leak Twitter they're like because like last week they're like saying like oh my god when is the trailer dropping like oh it's not gonna be this week because and they you Okay,

2128
02:47:17,210 --> 02:47:18,070
it's so funny.

2129
02:47:18,450 --> 02:47:27,890
Okay, rival leak twitters now use me as a point of reference as to when we get our preview stream.

2130
02:47:28,830 --> 02:47:36,730
Because I saw one of those rival leaks Twitter accounts that was like, guys, I don't think we're gonna get the streamer previews this week.

2131
02:47:36,790 --> 02:47:43,010
I don't think the trailer is dropping this week because Jokey Bird didn't put anything on her schedule for a special sponsor.

2132
02:47:45,690 --> 02:47:50,550
Because obviously, Because I'm the only VTBird that has like pre-scheduled streams.

2133
02:47:51,070 --> 02:47:54,970
So they're like, Jokey Bird didn't put anything on her sponsors this week.

2134
02:47:55,290 --> 02:47:59,270
So I guess I don't think we're getting our trailer this week or like the stream.

2135
02:48:01,370 --> 02:48:02,790
Because I'm the only one.

2136
02:48:03,150 --> 02:48:05,970
I'm the only one that like has scheduled streams.

2137
02:48:06,150 --> 02:48:07,730
So they're like, guys, I don't think so.

2138
02:48:07,830 --> 02:48:09,790
She's like, look, she doesn't schedule anything.

2202
02:53:51,900 --> 02:53:53,160
There's nothing important.

2203
02:53:54,660 --> 02:53:55,280
The door?

2204
02:53:56,460 --> 02:53:57,520
Is that openable?

2205
02:53:58,800 --> 02:53:59,600
Oh, it was.

2206
02:54:00,080 --> 02:54:00,620
Oh, no, it's not.

2207
02:54:01,020 --> 02:54:02,040
Yeah, they welded this.

2208
02:54:04,720 --> 02:54:06,160
I was gonna say, are you straight?

2209
02:54:06,500 --> 02:54:08,560
I'm thinking they welded that door shut.

2210
02:54:12,010 --> 02:54:13,590
Oh, I guess there was this door.

2211
02:54:14,830 --> 02:54:15,790
Oh, there's this door.

2212
02:54:16,030 --> 02:54:16,270
Okay.

2213
02:54:17,290 --> 02:54:18,870
What the fuck were they guarding that door?

2214
02:54:19,730 --> 02:54:23,320
Oh, hey, guys.

2215
02:54:24,360 --> 02:54:24,980
Pick it up.

2216
02:54:25,520 --> 02:54:26,180
No way, man.

2217
02:54:26,420 --> 02:54:27,300
That thing's dangerous.

2218
02:54:27,580 --> 02:54:28,400
You saw what it did.

2219
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:29,820
What did it do?

2220
02:54:30,860 --> 02:54:32,900
No, it's Batman's belt.

2221
02:54:33,720 --> 02:54:34,420
So what?

2222
02:54:34,640 --> 02:54:36,040
It's still just a belt.

2223
02:54:36,300 --> 02:54:37,060
Can you see me?

2224
02:54:37,340 --> 02:54:37,340
Why?

2225
02:54:37,640 --> 02:54:40,280
You afraid of a little electric shock?

2226
02:54:40,940 --> 02:54:42,420
Watch this, guys.

2227
02:54:42,820 --> 02:54:44,080
He's screwing with you.

2228
02:54:45,140 --> 02:54:45,740
What?

2229
02:54:46,840 --> 02:54:49,320
Oh, I chose the one person that can't be.

2230
02:54:49,400 --> 02:54:49,720
Okay.

2231
02:54:50,080 --> 02:54:50,540
I...

2232
02:54:51,860 --> 02:54:52,500
Really?

2233
02:54:53,040 --> 02:54:59,600
I actually, I chose the one person that can't be, okay, that's, that's so unlucky.

2234
02:55:00,140 --> 02:55:06,620
That's, how is I, guys, how, how was I supposed to know that the one person I chose?

2235
02:55:08,020 --> 02:55:09,240
That's crazy.

2236
02:55:10,780 --> 02:55:12,040
No way.

2237
02:55:14,100 --> 02:55:15,320
Oh my god, I can't see shit.

2238
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:20,840
The one guy I chose cannot be, cannot do a takedown.

2239
02:55:21,140 --> 02:55:22,400
That's insane.

2240
02:55:23,240 --> 02:55:25,320
How unlucky am I?

2241
02:55:28,500 --> 02:55:29,080
Alright, that's fine.

2242
02:55:30,980 --> 02:55:31,980
That's fucking right.

2243
02:55:33,960 --> 02:55:34,800
That's right.

2244
02:55:37,440 --> 02:55:39,560
That's right, now you can't see forever.

2245
02:55:43,770 --> 02:55:44,770
Oh my god.

2246
02:55:45,710 --> 02:55:47,770
Time to pay a hospital bill, too.

2247
02:55:49,290 --> 02:55:50,250
Jesus Christ.

2248
02:55:53,110 --> 02:55:54,770
Alright, we're gonna grab you out of here.

2249
02:55:55,130 --> 02:55:55,470
Jesus!

2250
02:55:55,670 --> 02:55:56,990
Oh my god, that's a concussion right there.

2251
02:55:57,250 --> 02:55:58,030
I miss.

2252
02:55:58,870 --> 02:56:00,950
I do miss the ice grenade, though.

2253
02:56:01,990 --> 02:56:02,850
Okay, that's right.

2254
02:56:02,930 --> 02:56:03,230
That's it.

2255
02:56:03,350 --> 02:56:03,510
That's it.

2256
02:56:03,570 --> 02:56:03,850

2257
02:56:04,290 --> 02:56:04,610
Get out.

02:56:04,710 --> 02:56:05,350
This is what's it.

2259
02:56:05,650 --> 02:56:06,890
This was a 1v1.

2260
02:56:10,130 --> 02:56:11,210

Bats aside, he needs this win.

2288
03:00:49,440 --> 03:00:53,580
Look, if the other guy, if everyone else votes against the wolf, we can win.

Down here?

2291
03:01:07,180 --> 03:01:09,000

03:02:36,520 --> 03:02:38,540
Man, someone should really help him.

Oh, I can never die.

2315
03:02:48,020 --> 03:02:49,180
I don't have HP, guys.

2316
03:02:50,620 --> 03:02:52,060
I just noticed that.

2317
03:02:52,740 --> 03:02:53,560
It's fine.

2318
03:02:54,280 --> 03:02:55,260
Can't kill me if I don't die.

2319
03:02:55,280 --> 03:02:56,120
Don't have HP.

2320
03:02:58,740 --> 03:02:59,140

God damn it.

2326
03:03:10,270 --> 03:03:11,870
I thought I didn't have to worry about HP.

2327
03:03:13,950 --> 03:03:14,470
Okay, yeah.

2328
03:03:15,010 --> 03:03:17,790
About making sure that he doesn't get his...

2329
03:03:17,790 --> 03:03:19,830
Gotta make sure he doesn't get his gun.

2330
03:03:20,790 --> 03:03:21,350
Oh, shit.

2331
03:03:23,030 --> 03:03:23,830
There you go.

2332
03:03:26,070 --> 03:03:29,110
As long as the guy with the gun is frozen, No one can have a gun.

2333
03:03:33,280 --> 03:03:33,760
There you go.

2334
03:03:35,520 --> 03:03:36,420
Come on, get over here.

2335
03:03:38,160 --> 03:03:39,060
Get over here.

Oh, wait, what?

2338
03:03:46,380 --> 03:03:48,600
Oh, I can't choke him out.

2339
03:03:49,580 --> 03:03:51,320
Oh, okay.

2340
03:03:51,580 --> 03:03:57,340
I was gonna say, I got, he has, like, the extra armor, so he won't let me choke him.

2341
03:03:58,520 --> 03:03:59,600
All right, get down here.

2342
03:04:00,080 --> 03:04:01,320
Come on, jump down.

2343
03:04:01,700 --> 03:04:03,120
Bro, just jump down, bro.

2344
03:04:04,280 --> 03:04:05,760
Why are you so scared?

2345
03:04:06,980 --> 03:04:07,980
What are you waiting for?

2346
03:04:08,320 --> 03:04:08,980
Get me down.

2347
03:04:09,520 --> 03:04:11,100
Bro, you can literally jump down.

2348
03:04:11,180 --> 03:04:12,240
It's not even that high.

2349
03:04:12,560 --> 03:04:13,900
It's not even that high.

2350
03:04:14,000 --> 03:04:15,400
Just jump down.

2351
03:04:16,700 --> 03:04:17,900
Why are you scared of?

2352
03:04:17,940 --> 03:04:18,820
You're literally a cop.

2353
03:04:19,000 --> 03:04:19,580
You're trained for this.

2354
03:04:19,680 --> 03:04:20,500
You have the legs.

2355
03:04:22,100 --> 03:04:22,780
You're safe.

2356
03:04:23,300 --> 03:04:24,580
Am I glad to see you?

2357
03:04:24,660 --> 03:04:26,080
Oh, God, bro, he's not looking so good.

2358
03:04:26,300 --> 03:04:26,800
Where are the others?

2359
03:04:27,260 --> 03:04:28,340
We were ambushed.

2360
03:04:29,740 --> 03:04:31,720
outside the steel mill and beat the crap out of us.

2361
03:04:31,940 --> 03:04:32,820
Yeah, you ain't looking so good.

2362
03:04:33,160 --> 03:04:34,960
These bastards dragged off the others and brought me here.

2363
03:04:35,540 --> 03:04:36,180
I'll find them.

2364
03:04:36,920 --> 03:04:37,480
Wait here.

2365
03:04:38,040 --> 03:04:38,400
Hide.

2366
03:04:41,220 --> 03:04:41,660
Alright.

2367
03:04:43,720 --> 03:04:44,960
Alright, we gotta this way.

2368
03:04:45,520 --> 03:04:46,020
No problem.

2369
03:04:46,480 --> 03:04:47,480
I'll just be waiting here.

2370
03:04:48,380 --> 03:04:49,400
I already did my job.

2371
03:04:49,520 --> 03:04:50,260
I saved you.

2372
03:04:52,020 --> 03:04:53,460
Okay, wait, where'd I have to go?

2373
03:04:55,500 --> 03:04:57,560
Okay, I gotta investigate the steel mill.

2374
03:04:58,540 --> 03:04:59,640
Oh, it's locked.

2375
03:04:59,740 --> 03:05:01,100
Was I not just here?

2376
03:05:04,140 --> 03:05:05,180
Go up.

2377
03:05:06,020 --> 03:05:06,600
That's gonna sit.

2378
03:05:06,740 --> 03:05:08,280
Like, I thought I was just there.

2379
03:05:09,820 --> 03:05:12,420
Oh, there's a baby that she never had.

2380
03:05:13,200 --> 03:05:13,480
Aw.

2381
03:05:15,440 --> 03:05:21,660
I'm talking to Commissioner Gordon of the GCPD.

2382
03:05:22,060 --> 03:05:23,160
What were they discussing?

2383
03:05:24,560 --> 03:05:27,180
We're hearing reports that a number of police officers are missing.

2384
03:05:27,300 --> 03:05:27,700
Oh.

2385
03:05:29,040 --> 03:05:30,240
Wait, is that negative?

2386
03:05:32,220 --> 03:05:33,720
Wait, that means negative, right?

2387
03:05:34,140 --> 03:05:35,360
I thought that was positive.

2388
03:05:36,540 --> 03:05:37,460
Yeah, it says negative now.

2389
03:05:37,680 --> 03:05:39,200
Oh, was she like, oh.

2390
03:05:40,420 --> 03:05:41,720
Did you guys know?

2391
03:05:41,980 --> 03:05:43,220
Okay, fun fact.

2392
03:05:44,360 --> 03:05:46,840
You know, like, I think this was like, is it Drake?

2393
03:05:47,400 --> 03:05:49,980
Fun fact, but like, so you know how like some...

2394
03:05:49,980 --> 03:05:51,340
Jesus, that's a lot of pregnancy tests.

2395
03:05:51,460 --> 03:05:52,480
Oh my God, that is a lot.

2396
03:05:52,580 --> 03:05:53,520
Bro, that's a lot of pee.

2397
03:05:54,000 --> 03:05:54,400
That...

2398
03:05:55,860 --> 03:05:57,240
That is a lot of pee.

2399
03:05:57,560 --> 03:05:59,480
Anyway, fun fact.

2400
03:06:01,360 --> 03:06:01,760
But...

2401
03:06:01,880 --> 03:07:18,660
so you know some celebrities they'll hook up with like you know random women like you know like at the party or instagram women well it's instagram women for some reason but uh but like uh so like you know the thing about it is that a lot of them want to baby trap the celebrities you know so uh so like a lot of them try to baby trap the celebrities because you know they can get child support off of them or like you know therefore you know you can force them to marry you and stuff because you know you have a baby so um so like drake apparently what drake does is that after he's done he's done he like um instead of throwing away the condom he would put um he would put like uh hot pepper sauce in the condom so like so that women who tried to like dig the baby juice uh they won't be able to use it to get themselves pregnant and the reason why i knew about this is because there was a lawsuit there was a lawsuit where one of the instagram models that drake hooked up with dug through the

2402
03:07:18,660 --> 03:08:22,200
trash can for the condom the day after and then tried to like you know get pregnant get pregnant through it but uh she ended up damaging her you know her virginie and so she tried to sue drink for endangering her body so she tried to sue drink because she was like this is your fault i fucked up my body um because you put pepper sauce hot chili pepper sauce um in the condom but like obviously what like no no of course she lost that's crazy bro that was her choice to do that she did not have to do that yeah so she lost the case because because she used trash like it was considered trash at that point

2403
03:08:25,360 --> 03:08:33,220
me me anyway I was the reason why I talked about this is I'm thinking do you think Harley Quinn also

2404
03:08:39,840 --> 03:08:55,180
anyway but yeah no that's you know it's justifiable to be super fucking paranoid too because you know you know like like these models or like these women will the fact that these women are trying to It's so scary.

2405
03:09:02,720 --> 03:09:03,580
There I go.

2406
03:09:04,800 --> 03:09:06,700
I won't leave you alone, Harley Quinn.

2407
03:09:06,860 --> 03:09:07,580
You know that.

2408
03:09:08,920 --> 03:09:11,200
Yeah, because you gotta be, like, so careful in everything.

2409
03:09:11,620 --> 03:09:13,640
Because they can be like, yeah, I'm on.

2410
03:09:13,720 --> 03:09:14,400
Yeah, of course.

2411
03:09:15,360 --> 03:09:17,240
Of course I'm on birth control.

2412
03:09:17,540 --> 03:09:19,900
And then, like, you know, they lie.

2413
03:09:22,760 --> 03:09:27,940
So, like, you know, it's understandable why they're so fucking paranoid about that.

2414
03:09:28,020 --> 03:09:31,220
The fact that they have to, like, Afterwards, they got...

2415
03:09:34,100 --> 03:09:34,780
Like...

2416
03:09:34,780 --> 03:09:36,820
It's understandable.

2417
03:09:38,720 --> 03:09:39,480
And then they...

2418
03:09:39,480 --> 03:09:41,080
They just lie about that?

2419
03:09:45,260 --> 03:09:46,720
That's scary, though.

2420
03:09:48,500 --> 03:09:50,400
You're telling me that people would lie?

2421
03:09:53,860 --> 03:09:54,700
I don't know.

2422
03:09:55,400 --> 03:09:57,020
How could they do that?

2423
03:10:05,270 --> 03:10:35,510
how to beat you up it was not even on the internet it's in real life I think that's the crazy part where is that they may have left some evidence that I can follow oh yeah I was gonna say what evidence oh there wait where's the evidence that radio belonged to a cop there may be evidence around here of where he was taken I should set up a crime scene alright scanning tab Joker will replace the hot sauce Mercury,

Surprised.

2427
03:10:44,910 --> 03:10:48,230

03:10:49,150 --> 03:10:52,910

03:10:55,870 --> 03:11:00,650
Where is it?

2432
03:11:01,530 --> 03:11:03,430

Tell me how to get through that door.

2473
03:13:19,460 --> 03:13:19,920
Where is the Joker?

2474
03:13:21,400 --> 03:13:22,500
Where is he?

2475
03:13:23,200 --> 03:13:24,080
Wait, he said sorry.

2476
03:13:24,440 --> 03:13:24,920
Where is sorry?

2477
03:13:27,480 --> 03:13:28,900
Force of habit.

2478
03:13:29,640 --> 03:13:31,560
Please, I'll tell you where they are.

2479
03:13:31,760 --> 03:13:33,160
Just don't hurt me.

2480

I'll do my best.

2481
03:13:37,440 --> 03:13:37,520
Jesus.

2482
03:13:37,900 --> 03:13:38,820
Okay, Batman.

2483
03:13:40,260 --> 03:13:41,380

Harley Street to obtain the security codes.

2485
03:13:44,640 --> 03:13:45,460
All right, that's fine.

2486
03:13:47,340 --> 03:13:48,300
Where's Harley?

2487
03:13:52,160 --> 03:13:54,100
Alright, we'll go here first.

03:13:59,710 --> 03:14:01,590
Yeah, he's like, I'll try not to hurt you.

2489
03:14:01,630 --> 03:14:03,790
Bro, he like fucking broke his neck.

2490
03:14:06,090 --> 03:14:09,650
Also, like, I'm still wondering where the fuck the Justice League is.

2491
03:14:11,410 --> 03:14:14,590
Oh, there he is.

2492
03:14:15,570 --> 03:14:19,430
I need to leave him until last so that he tells me what I want to know.

2493
03:14:19,670 --> 03:14:19,890
Oh.

2494
03:14:20,890 --> 03:14:21,570
Oops.

2495
03:14:22,650 --> 03:14:24,230
Sorry, I didn't think it would hurt him.

2496
03:14:28,070 --> 03:14:28,750
Sorry.

2497
03:14:29,130 --> 03:14:30,430

2499
03:14:33,690 --> 03:14:35,310
I was like, you!

2500
03:14:39,930 --> 03:14:42,550
Sorry, I got too excited there.

2501
03:14:45,750 --> 03:14:48,470
Dumbass cops should never have gotten themselves caught.

2502
03:14:49,150 --> 03:14:50,290
What happens now is...

2503
03:14:51,410 --> 03:14:53,090
Oh yeah, Goff Harley.

2504
03:14:53,230 --> 03:14:53,710
I just noticed.

2505
03:14:53,910 --> 03:14:55,210
Yeah, I noticed that too.

2506
03:14:56,230 --> 03:14:56,770
Oops.

2507
03:14:58,130 --> 03:14:59,330
I couldn't help it.

2508
03:14:59,450 --> 03:15:01,270
He was just so vulnerable.

2509
03:15:03,970 --> 03:15:11,990
You know, you know, when you're like, you're so vulnerable and then you just, you know, you just wanna kill him.

2510
03:15:19,740 --> 03:15:21,420
Is it though?

2511
03:15:23,800 --> 03:15:25,240
Oh my god, stop.

2512
03:15:30,460 --> 03:15:31,000
Oh god.

2513
03:15:32,600 --> 03:15:33,260
Okay, no.

2514
03:15:33,560 --> 03:15:34,940
No, we're not letting you do that.

2515
03:15:40,150 --> 03:15:41,310
We're not letting you do that.

2516
03:15:41,530 --> 03:15:43,190
I'm gonna take all of this if I have to.

2517
03:15:47,050 --> 03:15:47,870
Get out of here.

2518
03:15:48,990 --> 03:15:51,070
I have enough shit for this.

2519
03:15:52,050 --> 03:15:52,850
Get out of here.

2520
03:15:53,270 --> 03:15:54,030
That's right.

2521
03:15:56,230 --> 03:15:58,030
Wait, you got your fucking gun back?

2522
03:15:58,550 --> 03:15:59,010
That's right.

2523
03:15:59,130 --> 03:15:59,550
HP.

2524
03:16:00,590 --> 03:16:01,470
You think I care?

2525
03:16:01,630 --> 03:16:03,650
I got enough HP to take all of this.

2526
03:16:05,910 --> 03:16:07,350
Real unga bunga time.

2527
03:16:09,410 --> 03:16:10,130
Alright, there you go.

2528
03:16:11,210 --> 03:16:12,770
Now I can interrogate you.

2529
03:16:13,650 --> 03:16:14,450
Tell me!

2530
03:16:16,210 --> 03:16:17,490
I've got plot armor.

2531
03:16:18,330 --> 03:16:18,510
Wait,

2532
03:16:21,610 --> 03:16:22,850
do I not get my HP back?

2533
03:16:23,910 --> 03:16:24,670
Wait a minute.

2534
03:16:25,270 --> 03:16:26,090
Where's my HP?

2535
03:16:27,710 --> 03:16:28,230
Oh.

2536
03:16:28,230 --> 03:16:29,810
Oh, it's Continuous.

2537
03:16:29,990 --> 03:16:31,130
Oh, that's awkward.

2538
03:16:31,810 --> 03:16:32,570
Oh, okay.

2539
03:16:32,790 --> 03:16:34,010
That's all right.

2540
03:16:34,230 --> 03:16:36,110
Okay, now I have to actually stealth it.

2541
03:16:37,690 --> 03:16:42,950
Okay, so I didn't think that... Oh, wait, I get my HP back.

2542
03:16:43,110 --> 03:16:43,190

03:16:53,070 --> 03:16:55,730

03:19:11,400 --> 03:19:12,040
Alright, now.

2581
03:19:14,980 --> 03:19:15,360
Now.

2582
03:19:16,560 --> 03:19:17,500
Please don't hurt me.

2583
03:19:17,660 --> 03:19:18,260
Here it is.

2584
03:19:18,740 --> 03:19:19,320

2586
03:19:53,460 --> 03:19:55,640
Any interest in playing the VR version?

2587
03:19:56,180 --> 03:19:56,800
Not really.

2588
03:19:57,100 --> 03:19:58,000
I feel like...

2589
03:19:58,000 --> 03:20:00,660
Okay, I think VR is so hard to stream in general.

2590
03:20:01,120 --> 03:20:04,260
Only because, like, people can get motion...

2591
03:20:04,260 --> 03:20:07,960
Like, I don't get motion sickness, but people watching it will get motion sickness, you know?

2592
03:20:10,780 --> 03:20:11,360
Hey, Togey.

2593
03:20:11,460 --> 03:20:12,540
I just fell in another lap.

2594
03:20:12,720 --> 03:20:13,760
Seeing a stream makes me happy.

2595
03:20:13,880 --> 03:20:16,440
I might do some retail therapy and buy the controller.

2596
03:20:16,640 --> 03:20:17,680
Wow, thank you, Superchild.

2597
03:20:17,720 --> 03:20:18,480
Thank you, thank you.

2598
03:20:20,480 --> 03:20:22,320
Hope next lab you do better, Clell.

2599
03:20:22,540 --> 03:20:22,820

2600
03:20:23,340 --> 03:20:24,880
Dragoons and I are here to cheer you on.

2601
03:20:25,040 --> 03:20:25,820
You got this.

2602
03:20:26,320 --> 03:20:27,980
You got to raise our average IQ.

2603
03:20:30,880 --> 03:20:32,240
You and all the other...

2604
03:20:32,240 --> 03:20:34,380
All the other STEM goons out there.

2605
03:20:34,500 --> 03:20:36,040
You got to raise our average IQ.

2606
03:20:36,700 --> 03:20:37,740
You're our only hope.

2607
03:20:39,440 --> 03:20:39,700
What?

2608
03:20:43,660 --> 03:20:44,520
We believe.

2609
03:20:47,400 --> 03:20:47,840
Boom!

2610
03:20:51,200 --> 03:20:51,800
That's right.

2611
03:20:52,000 --> 03:20:52,540
What the fuck?

2612
03:20:52,720 --> 03:20:53,600

2613
03:20:57,040 --> 03:20:58,500
Yeah, all five of you guys.

2614
03:21:01,100 --> 03:21:01,520
That's right.

2615
03:21:02,000 --> 03:21:02,000
Where?

2616
03:21:02,400 --> 03:21:02,740
Where?

2617
03:21:04,400 --> 03:21:05,360
No, you don't.

2618
03:21:05,940 --> 03:21:06,920
Get your gun out of here.

2619
03:21:11,120 --> 03:21:12,760
I'll get him out of here, too.

2620
03:21:14,300 --> 03:21:15,560
You ain't picking that gun up.

2621
03:21:18,080 --> 03:21:19,480
I guess you are.

2622
03:21:20,800 --> 03:21:22,800
I guess you are picking that gun.

2623
03:21:23,120 --> 03:21:23,900
Okay, bro.

2624
03:21:24,160 --> 03:21:24,640
Get that gun.

2625
03:21:24,660 --> 03:21:26,060
Get that gun out of your hand!

2626
03:21:28,640 --> 03:21:30,640
Get that gun out of your hand too!

2627
03:21:35,140 --> 03:21:35,620
Alright.

2628
03:21:37,080 --> 03:21:37,680
There you go.

2630
03:21:44,500 --> 03:21:47,040

2631
03:21:48,380 --> 03:21:49,740
Okay, how do I get inside?

2632
03:21:50,180 --> 03:21:50,420
Here?

2633
03:21:51,800 --> 03:21:52,280
No.

2634
03:21:53,080 --> 03:21:54,800
It's like...

2635
03:21:55,380 --> 03:21:56,780
Where the fuck is the end?

2636
03:21:56,800 --> 03:21:57,580
Entrance?

2637
03:22:02,160 --> 03:22:02,440
Hello?

2638
03:22:06,380 --> 03:22:07,760
Am I stupid?

2639
03:22:07,940 --> 03:22:08,360
I am.

2640
03:22:08,660 --> 03:22:09,960
No, don't answer that, guys.

2641
03:22:15,890 --> 03:22:17,210
Where's the entrance?

2642
03:22:21,140 --> 03:22:22,480
Oh, there it is.

2643
03:22:24,160 --> 03:22:24,560
Okay.

03:22:25,920 --> 03:22:26,900
Found it.

2645
03:22:27,360 --> 03:22:28,260
Alright, here we go.

2646
03:22:29,520 --> 03:22:30,420
Okay, hack time.

We finally got it.

2653
03:23:16,210 --> 03:23:18,210
I thought we'd never get that takedown.

2654
03:23:19,970 --> 03:23:20,770
A takedown.

2655
03:23:23,230 --> 03:23:23,630

Wait, wait, wait.

2658
03:23:25,610 --> 03:23:26,110
He has a gun.

We just gotta make sure.

2666
03:23:35,050 --> 03:23:35,710
No guns.

2679
03:24:02,830 --> 03:24:03,370
That's fine.

2680
03:24:03,670 --> 03:24:04,890
He has no access to a gun.

2681
03:24:07,250 --> 03:24:07,650
God damn.

2682
03:24:07,670 --> 03:24:08,130

2688
03:24:24,100 --> 03:24:24,900
Not allowed.

2689
03:24:29,040 --> 03:24:31,420
Oh no, he's gonna throw the thing, isn't he?

2690
03:24:32,460 --> 03:24:33,020
Throw it!

2691
03:24:33,940 --> 03:24:34,960
Okay, I...

2692
03:24:36,840 --> 03:24:43,260
Okay, guys, I did say throw it, but I didn't think he was actually gonna throw it.

2693
03:24:46,380 --> 03:24:48,160
I am so dead.

2694
03:24:48,800 --> 03:24:50,060
I am so dead.

2695
03:24:53,840 --> 03:24:54,600

2696
03:24:55,680 --> 03:24:56,020

2697
03:24:58,600 --> 03:24:58,780
Okay.

2698
03:25:01,420 --> 03:25:02,280
Oh, I don't like this.

2699
03:25:02,440 --> 03:25:04,100
We gotta play a little pussy right now.

2700
03:25:07,940 --> 03:25:08,940
We got this.

2701
03:25:10,640 --> 03:25:12,720
We gotta play a little bit pussy.

2702
03:25:13,760 --> 03:25:15,280
Wait, what?!

2703
03:25:15,280 --> 03:25:17,100
No no no no no no no no.

2704
03:25:18,900 --> 03:25:19,980
Get out of here.

2705
03:25:20,180 --> 03:25:20,600
There you go.

2706
03:25:21,260 --> 03:25:22,100
That was the only gun.

2707
03:25:22,160 --> 03:25:23,540
Oh my god, that's not what I wanna do.

2708
03:25:24,420 --> 03:25:24,700
Oh god.

2709
03:25:25,240 --> 03:25:25,400
Oh god.

2710
03:25:26,000 --> 03:25:26,160
Okay.

2711
03:25:29,660 --> 03:25:30,260
Here we go.

2712
03:25:30,840 --> 03:25:32,000
We got the guy with the gun!

2713
03:25:33,980 --> 03:25:35,020
There you go.

2714
03:25:36,720 --> 03:25:37,520
Oh shit.

2715
03:25:37,700 --> 03:25:38,080
Oh shit!

2716
03:25:38,800 --> 03:25:39,040
Oh shit.

2717
03:25:39,040 --> 03:25:39,160
Oh shit.

2718
03:25:39,760 --> 03:25:40,060
Oh shit.

2719
03:25:40,600 --> 03:25:41,620
Who brought the gun?

2720
03:25:41,620 --> 03:25:42,560
I know, right?

2721
03:25:45,400 --> 03:25:47,500
Oh, God, not the guy with the gun again.

2722
03:25:48,340 --> 03:25:48,860
Okay.

2723
03:25:51,460 --> 03:25:51,940
It's fine.

2724
03:25:54,480 --> 03:25:55,020
Slow and steady.

2725
03:25:55,160 --> 03:25:57,880
I don't trust myself to melee right now.

2726
03:25:58,120 --> 03:25:59,680
I don't trust myself.

2727
03:26:01,660 --> 03:26:02,860
We got it.

2728
03:26:03,220 --> 03:26:04,120
I'll be very careful.

2729
03:26:04,200 --> 03:26:05,660
I'm literally living with 1 HP.

2730
03:26:06,440 --> 03:26:07,600
I don't trust myself.

2731
03:26:09,280 --> 03:26:09,840
Okay.

2732
03:26:10,260 --> 03:26:10,580
There we go.

2733
03:26:12,900 --> 03:26:34,560
whoa whoa whoa there you go slow and steady slow and steady slow and steady wins the race okay what happened

2734
03:26:39,960 --> 03:26:45,580
to me that someone chuck a rock at me what happened to me

2735
03:26:49,060 --> 03:26:50,300
No one knows we're down here.

2736
03:26:52,140 --> 03:26:53,880
Okay, I don't know what happened to me.

2737
03:26:53,940 --> 03:26:56,040
I swear to God, that was so weird.

2738
03:26:57,220 --> 03:26:58,920
What the fuck happened to me?

2739
03:27:03,240 --> 03:27:05,180
Like, what happened?

2740
03:27:07,140 --> 03:27:08,320
Actually, what happened?

2741
03:27:13,440 --> 03:27:13,740
Okay.

2742
03:27:17,900 --> 03:27:18,820
Oh my god, he has a gun.

2743
03:27:19,020 --> 03:27:19,820
I gotta get him out of here.

2744
03:27:20,660 --> 03:27:21,460
What the fuck?

2745
03:27:21,780 --> 03:27:22,620
What did I do?

2746
03:27:23,180 --> 03:27:23,980
Oh, I killed him.

2747
03:27:30,400 --> 03:27:31,660
There you go.

2748
03:27:33,080 --> 03:27:33,900
Okay, we're good.

2749
03:27:35,800 --> 03:27:36,720
We're not good.

2750
03:27:37,840 --> 03:27:38,120
We're good.

2751
03:27:42,780 --> 03:27:43,900
We're so healthy.

2752
03:27:45,020 --> 03:27:45,860
20 all the way.

2753
03:27:48,080 --> 03:27:49,020
Jesus Christ.

2754
03:27:51,680 --> 03:27:52,000
There you go.

2755
03:27:52,380 --> 03:27:53,260
We're so good now.

2756
03:27:56,750 --> 03:27:58,310
Don't worry, he's not gonna throw that, right?

2757
03:28:00,070 --> 03:28:00,790
Okay, there you go.

2758
03:28:01,030 --> 03:28:01,330
It's fine.

2759
03:28:02,070 --> 03:28:02,630
didn't get the hit.

2760
03:28:06,530 --> 03:28:07,210
Get ice!

2761
03:28:11,300 --> 03:28:12,800
Alright, we gotta get him out, though.

2762
03:28:16,440 --> 03:28:16,700
Oh no.

2763
03:28:18,420 --> 03:28:18,800
Oh no.

2764
03:28:19,780 --> 03:28:21,360
Why won't you get me my aerial attack?

2765
03:28:23,580 --> 03:28:24,440
Fuck this.

2766
03:28:26,580 --> 03:28:27,260
There you go.

2767
03:28:27,960 --> 03:28:30,120
For some reason, I wouldn't let me do the aerial attack.

2768
03:28:32,780 --> 03:28:33,160
Okay.

2769
03:28:35,120 --> 03:28:35,560
Wow.

2770
03:28:35,580 --> 03:28:37,060
For some reason, it's a lot faster.

2771
03:28:37,280 --> 03:28:37,720
Oh, shit.

2772
03:28:40,960 --> 03:28:41,440
Alright.

2773
03:28:42,140 --> 03:28:42,820
I got it.

2774
03:28:46,360 --> 03:28:46,840
Boom!

2775
03:28:49,160 --> 03:28:49,840
We did it.

2776
03:28:53,430 --> 03:28:54,950
God, that was a lot of goons.

2777
03:28:56,650 --> 03:28:59,110
That was way too many goons for my liking.

2778
03:29:01,070 --> 03:29:01,470
Okay.

2779
03:29:02,430 --> 03:29:03,030
We go.

2780
03:29:03,870 --> 03:29:04,950
Where do we go?

2781
03:29:05,910 --> 03:29:07,990
Where does fuck this Harley Quinn want me to do?

2782
03:29:09,370 --> 03:29:10,850
Like, where are the cops?

2783
03:29:15,260 --> 03:29:16,560
Where are the cops?

2784
03:29:16,700 --> 03:29:17,380
What the fuck?

2785
03:29:20,240 --> 03:29:23,000
I have to rescue the cops, but I don't know where the cops are.

2786
03:29:24,260 --> 03:29:25,420
Okay, not here.

2787
03:29:26,980 --> 03:29:27,720
Okay, that's good.

2788
03:29:27,800 --> 03:29:29,680
That limits the area.

2789
03:29:30,380 --> 03:29:32,960
I'm gonna put my tag on the next bank ski.

2790
03:29:33,640 --> 03:29:34,140
Bat ski.

2791
03:29:39,400 --> 03:29:40,720
Bat ski is here.

2792
03:29:40,740 --> 03:29:41,220
here.

2793
03:29:42,040 --> 03:29:42,340
Oh.

2794
03:29:43,500 --> 03:29:43,860
Okay.

2795
03:29:44,280 --> 03:29:44,280
Uh.

2796
03:29:48,480 --> 03:29:49,940
Baski is here.

2797
03:29:50,180 --> 03:29:51,200
For real now.

2798
03:29:53,260 --> 03:29:53,980
Okay.

2799
03:29:56,020 --> 03:29:57,240
Is this here?

2800
03:30:04,190 --> 03:30:04,830
Oh, pop.

2801
03:30:08,090 --> 03:30:08,630
All right.

2802
03:30:08,810 --> 03:30:09,870
It has to be through this door.

2803
03:30:10,150 --> 03:30:11,030
There's no other way.

2804
03:30:15,870 --> 03:30:16,370
Hello?

2805
03:30:18,190 --> 03:30:18,910
Hello?

2806
03:30:19,310 --> 03:30:19,770

Okay, okay, that's not cool.

2810
03:31:03,250 --> 03:31:04,830
Is this silent enough?

2811
03:31:10,070 --> 03:31:10,570
Okay.

2812
03:31:12,310 --> 03:31:12,930
It's fine.

2813
03:31:13,050 --> 03:31:13,910
We got rid of the sniper.

2814
03:31:16,730 --> 03:31:17,130
Boom!

2815
03:31:19,830 --> 03:31:22,210
Okay, I didn't realize the sniper had people.

2816
03:31:23,790 --> 03:31:25,830
I didn't realize the sniper had friends, okay?

2817
03:31:26,290 --> 03:31:27,570
I messed up.

2818
03:31:28,390 --> 03:31:29,770
Oh my God, what the fuck you mean?

2819
03:31:29,870 --> 03:31:32,230
I, oh my God, get me in the, get me through.

2820
03:31:32,530 --> 03:31:34,190
Oh my God, security area to continue.

2821
03:31:34,330 --> 03:31:34,970
Okay, this is bad.

2822
03:31:35,290 --> 03:31:35,930
This is so bad.

2823
03:31:36,110 --> 03:31:36,650
This is so bad.

2824
03:31:36,930 --> 03:31:37,330
Oh, a balloon.

2825
03:31:41,640 --> 03:31:42,000
Yeah.

2826
03:31:42,940 --> 03:31:44,060
Oh my God, I'm just getting shotgun.

2827
03:31:46,140 --> 03:31:47,220
Oh my God, it's everywhere.

2828
03:31:47,740 --> 03:31:48,340
It's everywhere.

2829
03:31:49,660 --> 03:31:53,020
It's a plan.

2830
03:32:08,420 --> 03:32:10,260
Look at that, it's a, it worked.

2831
03:32:18,300 --> 03:32:20,540
Stay calm, everyone.

2832
03:32:23,440 --> 03:32:27,360
I told you guys, it works.

2833
03:32:34,060 --> 03:32:36,340
If it works, it works, guys.

2834
03:32:40,490 --> 03:32:42,290
He'll never turn around.

2835
03:32:45,290 --> 03:32:46,790
I don't think...

2836
03:32:46,790 --> 03:32:47,430
What do you mean?

2837
03:32:47,530 --> 03:32:49,130
Negative stealth guys.

2838
03:32:49,410 --> 03:32:50,030
I won.

2839
03:32:50,470 --> 03:33:09,930
I won Can't be negative if I win Bam it's over It worked see I'm so stealthy Don't worry.

2840
03:33:10,050 --> 03:33:14,530
I got you you see that it was pretty cool wasn't it bro I

2841
03:33:17,910 --> 03:33:20,130
Minus one to a hundred.

2842
03:33:22,910 --> 03:33:23,930
Oh shit.

2843
03:33:34,340 --> 03:33:34,780
What?

2844
03:33:36,040 --> 03:33:38,280
Oh, that's how you got my gadgets.

2845
03:33:39,440 --> 03:33:42,480
Oh, the trackers.

2846
03:33:43,180 --> 03:33:45,240
Oh, that's right.

2847
03:33:46,040 --> 03:33:47,160
That's my DNA.

2848
03:33:47,820 --> 03:33:50,660
Only my DNA can wear the belt.

2849
03:33:52,860 --> 03:33:54,840
Oh, so that's what happened.

2850
03:33:55,900 --> 03:33:57,960
Like, how do I get a concussion from a chest?

2851
03:34:04,980 --> 03:34:06,580
Like, how do I pass out?

2852
03:34:06,720 --> 03:34:08,520
It hit my chest, not my head.

2853
03:34:08,680 --> 03:34:09,540
What's going on?

2854
03:34:10,180 --> 03:34:11,000
Have you found him?

2855
03:34:11,340 --> 03:34:13,800
Yeah, but I have a bulletproof army.

2856
03:34:14,780 --> 03:34:15,240
Don't worry.

2857
03:34:15,320 --> 03:34:16,700
Did my heart fucking stop?

2858
03:34:19,200 --> 03:34:21,440
Yeah, there's no vital organs on the chest.

2859
03:34:21,580 --> 03:34:22,060
Exactly.

2860
03:34:26,580 --> 03:34:26,960
Batman?

2861
03:34:27,400 --> 03:34:27,760
Batman?

2862
03:34:27,760 --> 03:34:28,800
Five minutes with a bat.

2863
03:34:29,060 --> 03:34:29,960
That's all I need.

2864
03:34:30,520 --> 03:34:30,920
Payback.

2865
03:34:31,020 --> 03:34:58,580
Joker he's just up there right what's stopping you nothing I guess then do it much in that room to climb up and teach Batman a lesson we'll watch yeah I took 57 sniper shots and I'm I was fine I thought he's got a plan don't want to get in the way do I do I know I sneak through this yeah I don't think I can

2866
03:35:02,320 --> 03:35:03,480
Robin smash!

2867
03:35:03,560 --> 03:35:04,240
Oh, shit.

2868
03:35:05,740 --> 03:35:06,620
Robin smash!

2869
03:35:07,140 --> 03:35:08,300
Robin smash!

2870
03:35:10,000 --> 03:35:10,980
That's right!

2871
03:35:11,860 --> 03:35:12,340
Boom!

2872
03:35:13,540 --> 03:35:16,160
Okay, I don't know if this actually, like...

2873
03:35:19,120 --> 03:35:21,320
I don't know if that actually, like, does anything.

2874
03:35:22,660 --> 03:35:23,460
Does it even kill?

2875
03:35:23,580 --> 03:35:24,680
Like, I don't fucking know.

2876
03:35:29,260 --> 03:35:29,840
Alright.

2877
03:35:31,040 --> 03:35:31,840
There you go.

2878
03:35:34,820 --> 03:35:35,780
That's right.

2879
03:35:40,810 --> 03:35:41,630
Bam, bam, bam.

2880
03:35:42,730 --> 03:35:45,350
I feel like a stick can cause more damage than fists.

2881
03:35:45,550 --> 03:35:46,130
Not gonna that.

2882
03:35:47,230 --> 03:35:49,990
If anything, I'm pretty sure I can cause, like, brain bleed.

2883
03:35:51,210 --> 03:35:56,050
So the fact that Robin is so confident that these goons are gonna be okay is very surprising.

2884
03:36:01,130 --> 03:36:01,610
There you go.

2885
03:36:03,350 --> 03:36:04,690
I want to make sure I get that hit.

2886
03:36:07,630 --> 03:36:26,410
All right, yeah, I think like a stick is like easier to get brain brain hemorrhages I didn't kill them the brain killed him Okay, wait Boom All right, that should be all of them, right?

2887
03:36:28,630 --> 03:36:30,210
All right, knock knock.

2888
03:36:30,790 --> 03:36:32,310
Oh, hey everyone.

2889
03:36:33,830 --> 03:36:36,650
Oh, that's not creepy at all Thank God.

2890
03:36:37,410 --> 03:36:39,110
Yeah, and some metal staff, too.

2891
03:36:39,290 --> 03:36:40,150
Quinn's got him trapped.

2892
03:36:43,270 --> 03:36:47,350
Harley's built some kind of monument to the Joker, and it's stopping me from getting to Batman.

2893
03:36:48,790 --> 03:36:50,710
Looking at this place, she's crazier than we thought.

2894
03:36:51,730 --> 03:36:54,290
I'm going to search the area and try to work out how to save him.

2895
03:36:55,510 --> 03:36:56,370
Dead bat.

2896
03:36:57,390 --> 03:36:58,350
One chart.

2897
03:36:59,650 --> 03:37:00,610
Joker forever.

2898
03:37:01,350 --> 03:37:02,030
Oh, that's not...

2899
03:37:02,030 --> 03:37:04,190
This is like misa-misa-shit type shit.

2900
03:37:08,680 --> 03:37:09,680
No, 100%.

2901
03:37:09,680 --> 03:37:11,420
Security panel appears to control the statue.

2902
03:37:12,560 --> 03:37:14,180
Batman will die in there if I don't find a key.

2903
03:37:15,140 --> 03:37:17,830
I guess I should go find Harley Quinn and ask her for it.

2904
03:37:18,680 --> 03:37:18,980
Oh.

2905
03:37:19,500 --> 03:37:20,840
Obtain the key card.

2906
03:37:22,280 --> 03:37:23,400
It's like Misa Misa.

2907
03:37:23,620 --> 03:37:25,000
Oh my god, it's so far.

2908
03:37:27,340 --> 03:37:28,100
Okay, we are.

2909
03:37:30,380 --> 03:37:31,220
That's me.

2910
03:37:37,040 --> 03:37:38,200
Where's he getting, like, lack of air?

2911
03:37:38,560 --> 03:37:39,040
Okay.

2912
03:37:41,140 --> 03:37:41,940
Damn it.

2913
03:37:42,260 --> 03:37:43,460
He's trapped in that thing.

2914
03:37:44,140 --> 03:37:45,680
Oh, it is lack of air.

2915
03:37:45,980 --> 03:37:46,240
Yeah.

2916
03:37:46,800 --> 03:37:48,420
I don't have much time.

2917
03:37:48,540 --> 03:37:49,240
He's running out of air.

2918
03:37:49,580 --> 03:37:51,960
Yeah, I was gonna say, is there no air holes in there?

2919
03:37:52,320 --> 03:37:53,280
That makes sense.

2920
03:38:05,270 --> 03:38:06,930
Yeah, just a little hee hee ha ha.

2921
03:38:07,910 --> 03:38:09,110
Wait, am I actually timed?

2922
03:38:10,150 --> 03:38:11,010
There's no way.

2923
03:38:11,070 --> 03:38:13,410
Someone just said he can, like, meditate for three days.

2924
03:38:13,550 --> 03:38:15,170
It's not like it took me three days to find him.

2925
03:38:15,370 --> 03:38:17,030
I need to find Harley Quinn or Batman will die in that.

2926
03:38:17,830 --> 03:38:19,170
Is that not where I have to go?

2927
03:38:20,810 --> 03:38:21,710
Oh, through here?

2928
03:38:21,850 --> 03:38:22,710
I thought I could get through.

2929
03:38:23,030 --> 03:38:23,830
Okay, never mind.

2930
03:38:26,350 --> 03:38:27,610
Oh, I am timed?

2931
03:38:27,730 --> 03:38:28,670
Oh, shit, Batman.

2932
03:38:28,890 --> 03:38:29,690
I'm sorry, bro.

2933
03:38:32,930 --> 03:38:34,770
Oh, shit, I was not paying attention.

2934
03:38:34,930 --> 03:38:35,450
I'm sorry.

2935
03:38:35,930 --> 03:38:36,710
Sorry, Dad.

2936
03:38:39,690 --> 03:38:40,490
Found anything?

2937
03:38:41,030 --> 03:38:42,390
Nah, it's just full of crap.

2938
03:38:42,610 --> 03:38:42,830
Wait, what?

2939
03:38:43,390 --> 03:38:44,210
Okay, that's fine.

2940
03:38:44,370 --> 03:38:45,510
I still got the silent takedown.

2941
03:38:47,050 --> 03:38:48,790
Don't worry, he's waiting a little bit.

2942
03:38:54,120 --> 03:38:55,060
It's okay.

2943
03:38:55,160 --> 03:38:56,780
If Batman dies, I inherit.

2944
03:38:58,020 --> 03:39:00,760
I inherit the Bruce Wayne fortune.

2945
03:39:01,900 --> 03:39:04,100
So technically...

2946
03:39:04,100 --> 03:39:07,800
If you think about it...

2947
03:39:08,360 --> 03:39:08,680
Wait.

2948
03:39:16,100 --> 03:39:17,760
Alright, here I'll go.

2949
03:39:21,410 --> 03:39:22,010
It's fine.

2950
03:39:24,770 --> 03:39:25,890
It's fine.

2951
03:39:27,010 --> 03:39:41,670

2953
03:39:57,910 --> 03:39:59,290
Damien hasn't been born yet.

2954
03:40:01,430 --> 03:40:02,710
Oh my god.

2955
03:40:03,290 --> 03:40:04,250
Oh, this is bad.

2956
03:40:04,750 --> 03:40:05,330
Oh my god.

2957
03:40:05,530 --> 03:40:05,910
How are you?

2958
03:40:06,150 --> 03:40:06,570
Oh my god.

2959
03:40:06,650 --> 03:40:07,170
There's a bit of a...

2960
03:40:07,170 --> 03:40:07,630
Fuck the sniper.

2961
03:40:07,770 --> 03:40:08,250
Fuck the sniper.

2962
03:40:08,510 --> 03:40:08,610
Actually.

2963
03:40:09,010 --> 03:40:10,010
Fuck this guy in general.

2964
03:40:11,350 --> 03:40:13,350
We actually get rid of the sniper in general.

2965
03:40:14,150 --> 03:40:15,110
The sniper is the...

2966
03:40:15,110 --> 03:40:16,430
Oh my god.

2967
03:40:20,850 --> 03:40:21,290
Okay.

2968
03:40:21,430 --> 03:40:21,870
It's fine.

2969
03:40:21,970 --> 03:40:24,190
I messed up because the sniper was like...

2970
03:40:24,190 --> 03:40:25,550
The sniper was so annoying.

2971
03:40:27,830 --> 03:40:29,130
I didn't do this again.

2972
03:40:31,690 --> 03:40:33,630
Okay, he doesn't know.

2973
03:40:33,630 --> 03:40:36,230
Who the hell is this fool?

2974
03:40:36,630 --> 03:40:37,010
All right.

2975
03:40:40,920 --> 03:40:42,440
Yeah, Damien hasn't been born yet.

2976
03:40:42,500 --> 03:40:43,160
Less to split.

2977
03:40:44,180 --> 03:40:46,280
Less inheritance to split, guys.

2978
03:40:51,880 --> 03:40:53,080
I don't know.

2979
03:40:53,800 --> 03:40:55,120
Oh, there's a vent here.

2980
03:40:56,320 --> 03:40:56,860
There he is.

2981
03:40:57,380 --> 03:40:58,800
Maybe I should have been in the vent.

2982
03:41:05,440 --> 03:41:06,000
Yeah.

2983
03:41:06,900 --> 03:41:08,480
I didn't even notice there was a vent.

2984
03:41:14,630 --> 03:41:15,110
Where do I go?

2985
03:41:15,210 --> 03:41:16,310
Do I just go through this door?

2986
03:41:22,600 --> 03:41:23,040
Where?

2987
03:41:24,460 --> 03:41:25,300
Like this?

2988
03:41:25,820 --> 03:41:26,320
Oh!

2989
03:41:26,960 --> 03:41:27,940
What the fuck?

2990
03:41:28,220 --> 03:41:30,800
You mean we could have done that this entire time?

2991
03:41:32,040 --> 03:41:32,400
Oops.

2992
03:41:42,850 --> 03:41:43,710

My bat vision doesn't see anything.

3005
03:42:48,500 --> 03:42:49,320
My bird vision.

3006
03:43:00,290 --> 03:43:01,450

Where did that go?

3073
03:49:27,040 --> 03:49:28,840
He's in the vents guys.

03:49:32,280 --> 03:49:32,820
Come on.

3075
03:49:40,820 --> 03:49:43,980
You could have stayed in the vents, bro.

03:49:44,520 --> 03:49:45,020
You could.

3077
03:49:47,400 --> 03:49:49,440

It would have been so fun.

3081
03:49:59,200 --> 03:50:02,040
You could have had such a good old time.

3082
03:50:02,200 --> 03:50:04,800
This is a jolly old time in the vents.

3083
03:50:05,300 --> 03:50:06,220
You and me.

3084
03:50:10,630 --> 03:50:12,490
Okay, the last sniper is right here.

3085
03:50:16,790 --> 03:50:18,010
What the fuck?

3086
03:50:18,210 --> 03:50:19,630
Why is he over there now?

3087
03:50:22,030 --> 03:50:22,610
There we go.

3088
03:50:24,110 --> 03:50:24,810
And that's everyone.

3089
03:50:26,110 --> 03:50:27,190
Oh no, there's one more guy.

3090
03:50:33,780 --> 03:50:34,580
Where is he going?

3091
03:50:36,040 --> 03:50:37,960
I don't even know where he's going.

3092
03:50:40,820 --> 03:50:41,420
Whoa.

3093
03:50:42,480 --> 03:50:42,860
Whoa.

3094
03:50:45,160 --> 03:50:45,600
Corner!

3095
03:50:46,140 --> 03:50:46,800
That's right!

3096
03:50:47,140 --> 03:50:47,460
Corner!

3097
03:50:48,760 --> 03:50:53,680
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

3098
03:50:56,760 --> 03:50:58,120
We spawn indefinitely.

3099
03:50:58,960 --> 03:50:59,580
Corner again!

3100
03:51:05,530 --> 03:51:06,410
Wait a minute!

3101
03:51:07,190 --> 03:51:08,190
You spawn forever!

3102
03:51:11,390 --> 03:51:12,130
Come on.

3103
03:51:17,720 --> 03:51:18,720
Oh, shit.

3104
03:51:20,100 --> 03:51:21,320
Come on, you can't do that forever.

3105
03:51:22,140 --> 03:51:22,840
I know you can.

3106
03:51:23,900 --> 03:51:24,500
There we go.

3107
03:51:26,960 --> 03:51:28,640
Oh my god, she escaped to a vantage point.

3108
03:51:29,180 --> 03:51:30,240
Oh, this is not good.

3109
03:51:32,580 --> 03:51:33,560
This is not good.

3110
03:51:33,780 --> 03:51:34,260
No, no!

3111
03:51:34,540 --> 03:51:35,100
Oh, God!

3112
03:51:38,220 --> 03:51:51,800
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, okay, okay, oh, God, okay,

3113
03:51:58,440 --> 03:51:58,980
there you go,

3114
03:52:03,440 --> 03:52:16,320
there you go, there's no plan, there's no plan, all right, here you go, get off me, Oh, that was close.

3115
03:52:22,460 --> 03:52:24,640
You'll never find it.

3116
03:52:25,700 --> 03:52:29,020
He'll never search between the bobs.

3117
03:52:33,860 --> 03:52:35,200
Whoa, Robin.

3118
03:52:36,040 --> 03:52:36,460
Whoa.

3119
03:52:38,520 --> 03:52:39,640
Robin.

3120
03:52:41,200 --> 03:52:42,580
That's crazy.

3121
03:52:43,440 --> 03:52:43,500
Yeah.

3122
03:52:47,220 --> 03:52:49,480
That's crazy, Robin.

3123
03:52:49,980 --> 03:52:53,360
You gotta ask the women's permission first.

3124
03:53:01,180 --> 03:53:02,200
Alright, this way.

3125
03:53:04,380 --> 03:53:05,740
It's for justice.

3126
03:53:06,980 --> 03:53:08,500
So it's fine.

3127
03:53:11,280 --> 03:53:12,400
Alright, this way.

3128
03:53:15,440 --> 03:53:16,160
Oh, what?

3129
03:53:16,480 --> 03:53:17,580
What's up there?

3130
03:53:18,600 --> 03:53:19,320
That's not cool.

3131
03:53:19,860 --> 03:53:21,020
Come back to play.

3132
03:53:23,300 --> 03:53:24,740
Oh my god!

3133
03:53:25,860 --> 03:53:27,420
Bro, even he's here?

3134
03:53:28,280 --> 03:53:29,640
Oh, this is not good for me.

3135
03:53:30,160 --> 03:53:31,840
Wait, this is not good for me yet.

3136
03:53:35,370 --> 03:53:37,710
Oh god, guys, guys, there's a lot.

3137
03:53:38,250 --> 03:53:39,090
There's a lot.

3138
03:53:40,550 --> 03:53:42,270
Okay, as long as he...

3139
03:53:45,420 --> 03:53:46,300
Are you serious?

3140
03:53:46,400 --> 03:53:46,580
Okay.

3141
03:53:49,380 --> 03:53:52,520
Oh my god, guys, guys, guys, I'm not okay.

3142
03:53:53,120 --> 03:53:53,600
I'm...

3143
03:53:57,760 --> 03:53:58,480
Oh no.

3144
03:53:58,880 --> 03:53:59,300
Oh no.

3145
03:53:59,340 --> 03:54:01,240
I don't have eyes like my dad.

3146
03:54:01,820 --> 03:54:03,580
Okay, we'll just use him to kill everyone.

3147
03:54:04,280 --> 03:54:04,540
This is it.

3148
03:54:04,560 --> 03:54:04,880
That's it.

3149
03:54:05,060 --> 03:54:05,200
That's it.

3150
03:54:05,260 --> 03:54:06,320
I'll use him to kill him.

3151
03:54:07,580 --> 03:54:09,600
Okay, it's perfectly aligned, big bro.

3152
03:54:10,980 --> 03:54:11,600
There we go.

3153
03:54:11,640 --> 03:54:11,980
There we go.

3154
03:54:12,020 --> 03:54:12,460
There we go.

3155
03:54:13,740 --> 03:54:15,980
All right, it's perfectly aligned just for you.

3156
03:54:18,200 --> 03:54:18,620
Come on.

3157
03:54:18,680 --> 03:54:19,140
Come on.

3158
03:54:19,320 --> 03:54:20,080
Are you serious?

3159
03:54:20,200 --> 03:54:20,900
Okay, that's fine.

3160
03:54:23,920 --> 03:54:24,540
There we go.

3161
03:54:25,740 --> 03:54:31,940
a line of kill me too does he even kill anyone I

3162
03:54:36,380 --> 03:54:58,050
don't even know if he's killing anyone is he actually killing anyone or am I just wasting time bro I know I have to hold counter bro just oh it does it does it does it does do you see that did you see that oh my god he's chucking his own oh my god it actually is like bowling.

3163
03:54:59,730 --> 03:55:00,590
Wait, it's working!

3164
03:55:00,750 --> 03:55:01,190
It's working!

3165
03:55:03,090 --> 03:55:04,610
Okay, okay, it's actually working.

3166
03:55:05,950 --> 03:55:07,090
It actually is like bowling.

3167
03:55:09,110 --> 03:55:11,410
I think it's like the only way I can deal with this.

3168
03:55:13,630 --> 03:55:14,410
Oh my god, okay.

3169
03:55:15,410 --> 03:55:17,450
He's not running as fast as I would like.

3170
03:55:21,650 --> 03:55:22,170
There you go.

3171
03:55:23,270 --> 03:55:23,710
There you go.

3172
03:55:25,730 --> 03:55:26,390
It works.

3173
03:55:26,470 --> 03:55:27,210
The strategy works.

3174
03:55:27,330 --> 03:55:30,770
I just need to make bait them early in the group.

3175
03:55:32,490 --> 03:55:33,030
There you go.

3176
03:55:35,830 --> 03:55:36,430
All right, here's more.

3177
03:55:36,810 --> 03:55:37,650
Here's more.

3178
03:55:38,090 --> 03:55:38,570
Bullying.

3179
03:55:41,490 --> 03:55:43,150
All right, come on.

3180
03:55:45,350 --> 03:55:46,350
Come on, you got this.

3181
03:55:46,590 --> 03:55:47,470
Oh, oh, oh my God.

3182
03:55:47,550 --> 03:55:48,810
It's actual bullying now.

3183
03:55:49,470 --> 03:55:49,730
All right.

3184
03:55:52,750 --> 03:55:53,230
Split.

3185
03:55:56,710 --> 03:55:57,970
Not a strike yet, bro.

3186
03:55:58,830 --> 03:55:59,530
Not a strike.

3187
03:55:59,550 --> 03:56:01,090
Oh, no.

3188
03:56:03,050 --> 03:56:04,390
A reverse bowling.

3189
03:56:08,160 --> 03:56:09,180
Alright, here we go.

3190
03:56:09,840 --> 03:56:10,940
This is the only way.

3191
03:56:11,060 --> 03:56:12,320
There's way too many people.

3192
03:56:15,620 --> 03:56:15,880
Come on.

3193
03:56:16,920 --> 03:56:18,740
Come on, he's going to get another bowling ball.

3194
03:56:19,480 --> 03:56:20,100
Another strike.

3195
03:56:20,200 --> 03:56:21,040
Are you going to get a strike?

3196
03:56:24,740 --> 03:56:25,380
It's okay.

3197
03:56:25,580 --> 03:56:26,340
Batman's 5.

3198
03:56:27,680 --> 03:56:28,440
He's so healthy.

3199
03:56:29,760 --> 03:56:31,680
Alright, maybe I should try helping out now.

3200
03:56:33,820 --> 03:56:34,280
Wait, wait, wait.

3201
03:56:34,320 --> 03:56:37,620
Wait, wait, unless...

3202
03:56:37,620 --> 03:56:39,360
Nice, okay, that's a lot of people down.

3203
03:56:44,240 --> 03:56:45,160
See, it helped!

3204
03:56:46,580 --> 03:56:48,400
No, I needed to kill all those people.

3205
03:56:52,850 --> 03:56:53,490
See, look at that!

3206
03:56:54,170 --> 03:56:55,230
Now it's me and him.

3207
03:56:59,140 --> 03:56:59,620
There we go.

3208
03:56:59,940 --> 03:57:00,660
I told you!

3209
03:57:01,740 --> 03:57:02,920
Now it's just me and him.

3210
03:57:05,380 --> 03:57:06,780
I told you it works.

3211
03:57:07,420 --> 03:57:07,880
Boom!

3212
03:57:10,600 --> 03:57:12,000
I did it.

3213
03:57:12,080 --> 03:57:13,400
I got a strike.

3214
03:57:20,960 --> 03:57:22,340
I got the Wii Sport high score.

3215
03:57:22,500 --> 03:57:23,820
Wait, he could have just done that?

3216
03:57:28,090 --> 03:57:28,610
Hey, Dad.

3217
03:57:28,930 --> 03:57:29,430
What kept you?

3218
03:57:30,370 --> 03:57:31,810
I'm fucking sorry.

3219
03:57:32,830 --> 03:57:36,050
Where's your other son's not here to save your life?

3220
03:57:38,630 --> 03:57:40,270
Nightwing didn't come.

3221
03:57:46,150 --> 03:57:46,830
That's it.

3222
03:57:46,930 --> 03:57:47,870
You saved the cops.

3223
03:57:48,590 --> 03:57:49,510
I'll handle the bombs.

3224
03:57:53,660 --> 03:57:55,680
Wait, I have to handle the mobs?

3225
03:57:55,860 --> 03:57:56,700
Oh no, I don't.

3226
03:57:57,080 --> 03:57:57,300
Nice.

3227
03:57:58,020 --> 03:58:00,300
If you use the bomb, I got this.

3228
03:58:01,720 --> 03:58:02,840
I got this.

3229
03:58:08,550 --> 03:58:10,130
Dead, mad, fat.

3230
03:58:13,740 --> 03:58:13,900
Okay.

3231
03:58:14,060 --> 03:58:15,940
The workings of this bomb look familiar.

3232
03:58:16,280 --> 03:58:17,480
I need to shut it down.

3233
03:58:17,860 --> 03:58:18,600
Then examine it.

3234
03:58:19,020 --> 03:58:19,680
That's it?

3235
03:58:20,800 --> 03:58:21,760
Oh, that's easy.

3236
03:58:22,100 --> 03:58:22,860
What the fuck?

3237
03:58:23,400 --> 03:58:27,640
The bombs have been built using explosives stolen from the GCPD lockup last year.

3238
03:58:27,660 --> 03:58:38,220
week harley quinn hasn't changed the detonation frequency i'll calibrate the cowl to locate any other objects tuned into this frequency yeah just just punch the bomb

3239
03:58:47,820 --> 03:59:01,660
this way it's just that easy i just okay tim tim i thought tim i thought we agreed that you would you handle the the goons why are there goons here tim

3240
03:59:04,880 --> 03:59:06,060

3241
03:59:13,350 --> 03:59:14,290
Then what happened?

3242
03:59:14,470 --> 03:59:15,670
We had one job!

3243
03:59:21,720 --> 03:59:23,500
You literally had one job!

3244
03:59:29,450 --> 03:59:30,410
This way.

3245
03:59:33,190 --> 03:59:33,690
What the fuck?

3246
03:59:33,750 --> 03:59:34,310
There's a sniper?

3247
03:59:34,830 --> 03:59:35,410
Oh shit.

3248
03:59:36,270 --> 03:59:36,990
That's fine.

3249
03:59:40,210 --> 03:59:41,470
That's fucking right, bitch.

3250
03:59:45,760 --> 03:59:46,160
Alright.

3251
03:59:48,960 --> 03:59:49,820
Here we go.

3252
03:59:49,860 --> 03:59:51,920
Gotta go this way.

3253
03:59:53,560 --> 03:59:53,580
Here?

3254
03:59:54,500 --> 03:59:55,680
Oh, there it is.

3255
03:59:59,330 --> 04:00:00,410
There you go.

3256
04:00:02,970 --> 04:00:04,990
Oh my god, how many bombs did she do?

3257
04:00:05,950 --> 04:00:06,510
Murderer.

3258
04:00:07,890 --> 04:00:09,230
Alright, another bomb down.

3259
04:00:11,630 --> 04:00:12,190
Boom!

3260
04:00:15,150 --> 04:00:17,270
Oh, Tim is rescuing the cops.

3261
04:00:17,390 --> 04:00:17,790
Oh, okay.

3262
04:00:18,630 --> 04:00:20,190
I thought we had a deal.

3263
04:00:20,350 --> 04:00:21,190
We're like...

3264
04:00:21,190 --> 04:00:21,590
Oh, yeah.

3265
04:00:21,610 --> 04:00:22,150
this way.

3266
04:00:24,230 --> 04:00:26,850
I thought you said you handle the goons.

3267
04:00:27,090 --> 04:00:28,570
I didn't realize he said the cops.

3268
04:00:31,590 --> 04:00:31,950
You guys?

3269
04:00:34,150 --> 04:00:34,830
Good question.

3270
04:00:40,050 --> 04:00:41,130
Guys, come on.

3271
04:00:41,270 --> 04:00:41,930
Come on.

3272
04:00:43,350 --> 04:00:44,210
This is it.

3273
04:00:46,830 --> 04:00:47,390
Bro, okay.

3274
04:00:48,350 --> 04:00:50,050
We all die if it explodes.

3275
04:00:50,970 --> 04:00:51,490
Okay.

3276
04:00:51,610 --> 04:00:52,490
Yeah, you don't remember it.

3277
04:00:52,830 --> 04:00:53,750
We all die.

3278
04:00:59,850 --> 04:01:00,670
Oh my god.

3279
04:01:01,230 --> 04:01:01,770
That's it.

3280
04:01:04,330 --> 04:01:06,990
I think he forgot that we all die here.

3281
04:01:14,100 --> 04:01:16,460
Jesus Christ, that was a lot of damage.

3282
04:01:18,460 --> 04:01:19,700
Alright, now I can kill him.

3283
04:01:21,560 --> 04:01:22,540
Get over here.

3284
04:01:26,480 --> 04:01:27,500
Oh my god, it's this way.

3285
04:01:30,040 --> 04:01:31,300
Open, open, open.

3286
04:01:33,180 --> 04:01:34,500
Oh god, where is it?

3287
04:01:38,350 --> 04:01:39,570
Wait, how do I get over here?

3288
04:01:41,410 --> 04:01:41,850
What?

3289
04:02:03,470 --> 04:02:04,110
Oh, shit!

3290
04:02:04,310 --> 04:02:05,870
It's here, it's here, it's here, it's here!

3291
04:02:05,870 --> 04:02:06,370
Oh my god.

3292
04:02:07,850 --> 04:02:09,330
There you go, there you go, there you go.

3293
04:02:11,350 --> 04:02:12,730
I forgot about this area.

3294
04:02:14,270 --> 04:02:15,070
Are you serious?

3295
04:02:20,210 --> 04:02:21,390
Oh my god, bats!

3296
04:02:21,750 --> 04:02:21,750
No!

3297
04:02:22,370 --> 04:02:22,810
No!

3298
04:02:26,270 --> 04:02:28,030
Okay, I can't tag more than one.

3299
04:02:33,000 --> 04:02:33,240
Okay.

3300
04:02:40,970 --> 04:02:41,570
Forever.

3301
04:02:45,880 --> 04:02:46,740
Oh, thank God.

3302
04:02:47,620 --> 04:02:48,140
Thank God.

3303
04:02:48,320 --> 04:02:51,060
I forgot, like, I'm Batman this time.

3304
04:02:52,060 --> 04:02:53,260
Because Tim's going to do shit.

3305
04:02:57,700 --> 04:02:58,900
Joker forever.

3306
04:03:10,370 --> 04:03:11,770
Yuki's here to save us.

3307
04:03:11,990 --> 04:03:12,550
We're doomed.

3308
04:03:13,390 --> 04:03:13,690
Absolutely.

3309
04:03:14,050 --> 04:03:14,610
It was a super chat.

3310
04:03:14,690 --> 04:03:15,490
Thank you.

3311
04:03:16,510 --> 04:03:17,910
Return to Joker's stride.

3312
04:03:18,030 --> 04:03:18,990
I have to go all the way.

3313
04:03:19,070 --> 04:03:20,450
God damn it, Harley.

3314
04:03:21,750 --> 04:03:23,170
Why can't I just leave?

3315
04:03:24,150 --> 04:03:28,770
I've been fucking backtracked all the way back to your goddamn creepy-ass stride.

3316
04:03:32,210 --> 04:03:33,850
I thought we done.

3317
04:03:35,470 --> 04:03:36,430
And this way.

3318
04:03:41,820 --> 04:03:42,200
I have to go.

3319
04:03:42,220 --> 04:03:46,800
back to a creepy ass shrine okay

3320
04:03:50,090 --> 04:04:19,230
all right I'm coming over Harley all right what is it am I fighting this Mecca oh god all right it's a Mecca fight now oh wait what the fuck this Bioshock Tad wait they okay I was gonna say do they not.

3321
04:04:25,780 --> 04:04:28,680
Okay, I was gonna say, can I not counter robots?

3322
04:04:31,460 --> 04:04:32,340
Oh my god.

3323
04:04:32,740 --> 04:04:34,000
Oh my god, there's so many combos.

3324
04:04:34,400 --> 04:04:35,360
It never stops.

3325
04:04:36,880 --> 04:04:37,440
That's right.

3326
04:04:37,700 --> 04:04:39,920
Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

3327
04:04:40,960 --> 04:04:42,900
32, 34, 36.

3328
04:04:44,280 --> 04:04:44,740
That's right.

3329
04:04:44,800 --> 04:04:45,620
Oh, it stopped.

3330
04:04:45,940 --> 04:04:47,560
I was gonna say nothing has stopped me.

3331
04:04:48,640 --> 04:04:49,260
And that stopped.

3332
04:04:50,720 --> 04:04:51,500
Ooh, it thought.

3333
04:04:54,180 --> 04:04:56,780
Wait, it doesn't even tell me when I can counter them.

3334
04:05:01,390 --> 04:05:02,010
That's fine.

3335
04:05:05,050 --> 04:05:06,850
That's right, you don't get to join in on fun.

3336
04:05:11,880 --> 04:05:13,060
That's why we're going forever.

3337
04:05:16,000 --> 04:05:17,680
No fun for you.

3338
04:05:22,610 --> 04:05:23,490
Okay, nice.

3339
04:05:26,130 --> 04:05:26,850
I'll keep going!

3340
04:05:27,310 --> 04:05:28,190
It never stops!

3341
04:05:29,490 --> 04:05:31,370
Until it does, like right now.

3342
04:05:32,330 --> 04:05:33,410
Oh shit.

3343
04:05:37,190 --> 04:05:38,030
I just don't miss.

3344
04:05:57,720 --> 04:05:58,120
Hey.

3345
04:06:01,220 --> 04:06:03,340
There's no way she'll expect this, right?

3346
04:06:05,280 --> 04:06:06,680
How the fuck?

3347
04:06:08,240 --> 04:06:09,700
What if I just grapple you?

3348
04:06:13,980 --> 04:06:18,020
What if I just keep grappling?

3349
04:06:20,140 --> 04:06:30,370
requires key card to unlock oh what what

3350
04:06:36,060 --> 04:07:00,440
can I counter it oh I thought like legitimately I didn't realize I counter it oh my god just grab her foot grab your foot I don't know it was just that easy I don't know I thought it'd be so hard I didn't realize I could just grab her I thought it would be much more difficult.

3351
04:07:03,780 --> 04:07:06,800
She could just, I was like, I didn't realize it'd be that easy!

3352
04:07:07,140 --> 04:07:08,400
I didn't realize!

3353
04:07:09,800 --> 04:07:17,740
It seems like it would be the hardest boss fight of my life, but I just grabbed her for me.

3354
04:07:22,020 --> 04:07:25,400
I don't know, I assume a boss fight would be hard.

3355
04:07:26,820 --> 04:07:27,520
Quiet.

3356
04:07:29,760 --> 04:07:30,240
Where's Robin?

3357
04:07:31,380 --> 04:07:32,640
I thought he was with you.

3358
04:07:33,420 --> 04:07:34,660
I got your toes.

3359
04:07:35,380 --> 04:07:36,360
Hey, where is Robin?

3360
04:07:37,140 --> 04:07:39,800
This entire job was to save the cops.

3361
04:07:39,980 --> 04:07:43,940
What have you done?

3362
04:07:44,980 --> 04:07:47,440
Now you know how it feels.

3363
04:07:48,820 --> 04:07:49,100
Robin?

3364
04:07:51,320 --> 04:07:52,400
Oh, shit.

3365
04:07:57,740 --> 04:07:59,840
Oh, he's alive!

3366
04:08:04,210 --> 04:08:05,550
Just got up.

3367
04:08:09,310 --> 04:08:11,210
Got it just in time.

3368
04:08:13,050 --> 04:08:13,070
Yay!

3369
04:08:13,550 --> 04:08:14,050
Hey, kid.

3370
04:08:14,710 --> 04:08:15,290
Is he alright?

3371
04:08:16,370 --> 04:08:17,110
Yeah, sure.

3372
04:08:18,210 --> 04:08:19,490
Bro, he dresses like a bat.

3373
04:08:19,610 --> 04:08:20,910
You really think he's okay?

3374
04:08:24,330 --> 04:08:25,010
Birderang!

3375
04:08:28,820 --> 04:08:29,740
Oh, dang!

3376
04:08:29,760 --> 04:08:56,000
it oh my god okay it's here someone in my chat was like depends on how fast it will take you for the boss fight so i remember someone said that because i was like oh how long is the dlc and someone in my chat was like well it'll be one to two hours depending on how long it's gonna take you on the last boss fight so in my head i didn't i thought it'd be like some fucking elaborate shit against harley but i didn't realize just grab her feet like

3377
04:08:59,760 --> 04:09:06,100
I was like, oh yeah, surely I have to do like 20 things before I get to it.

3378
04:09:06,300 --> 04:09:09,980
I, it was right.

3379
04:09:10,540 --> 04:09:15,700
Yeah, the hardest boss, but yeah.

3380
04:09:17,260 --> 04:09:18,560
Oh, that was fun.

3381
04:09:18,800 --> 04:09:23,320
I can't believe we managed to finish a DLC too, because usually we skip the DLC part.

3382
04:09:24,080 --> 04:09:24,720
But you know what?

3383
04:09:24,900 --> 04:09:57,740
I felt like, you know, we finished the game in two hours, like for two hours, I figured like and we spent like an hour of that like yapping so i was just like you know what i'll throw in a dlc too um just because like um just because you know i finished the game a lot faster than i thought i would anyway i've had a lot of fun playing batman um you know i enjoy i enjoyed the jokies weakness feed absolutely thank you the super chat thank you thank you i have always enjoyed dc lore i've I've always enjoyed DC comics and all the...

3384
04:09:59,440 --> 04:10:03,720
You know, I've always been a DC gal versus a Marvel gal, despite, you know, I play a lot of Marvel rivals.

3385
04:10:03,940 --> 04:10:11,220
I still enjoy DC more in terms of, like, story-wise, the comics, story, and the film.

3386
04:10:11,260 --> 04:10:15,120
Jesus Christ, why is this music so scary?

3387
04:10:15,480 --> 04:10:17,080
Also, is there an after-credit scene?

3388
04:10:19,000 --> 04:10:24,200
Chat, is there an after-credit scene, guys, for this?

3389
04:10:25,240 --> 04:11:22,180
I just think I don't know I personally think the I personally think like DC villains are more um they're more what's the word uh like they're more memorable than Marvel villains like I'm like the first to be fair a lot of the DC villains are also mostly from Batman but distinct and iconic yeah they're a lot more iconic and distinct because like I'm thinking Marvel villains that I know this that's really it a lot of Marvel villains are also more so of like anti-heroes like you know you could be like oh yeah what about Loki but he's like an anti-hero now um but if I think about like DC villains I'll be like oh there's the Riddler there's Joker there's Lex Luthor um like there's uh there's two-faced there's um reverse flash

3390
04:11:25,420 --> 04:11:51,820
bane like i felt like a lot i a lot i mean there is dr doom but like i don't know i don't think dr doom is that i don't think dr doom is like that what's it called i i find his personality and backstory not as interesting as a dc villain um that's how i feel when i think of dr doom um i And like,

3391
04:11:52,760 --> 04:12:09,520
and then there's, uh, well, Magneto is more like an anti-hero, because he thinks he, what he's doing is for the good, you know, like, he thinks he's doing good things, you know, like, it's not like he tries to be a villain, he just hates all humankind,

3392
04:12:09,840 --> 04:12:20,340
which is understandable, because he's a fucking mutant, he's a disgusting mutant, sorry, um, I'm, That's a joke.

3393
04:12:20,660 --> 04:12:21,460
Slash JK.

3394
04:12:23,600 --> 04:12:25,260
Slash JK.

3395
04:12:25,660 --> 04:12:26,460
I'm joking.

3396
04:12:26,900 --> 04:12:29,160
I'm joking, guys.

3397
04:12:31,980 --> 04:12:33,440
Poor mutant cat.

3398
04:12:34,060 --> 04:12:36,780
Now he would kill me.

3399
04:12:36,980 --> 04:12:37,620
What do you mean?

3400
04:12:37,680 --> 04:12:39,280
Now we know your side.

3401
04:12:39,740 --> 04:12:42,260
He would kill me.

3402
04:12:43,780 --> 04:13:56,480
If I am face to face with Magneto, because I am human, quote unquote, human I would just be dead like so um so yeah like I'm just thinking like I felt like I feel like those DC villains are much also because Marvel is now owned by Disney so they're so they're so clean they're so like oh what's the word when you know when disney owns something they try not to be risky with anything they're so they're so like cautious with whatever yeah they're so sanitized and cautious and watered down with what they want to do with marvels but dc they they go fucking crazy now with their lore and everything because they're no not owned by disney because they don't want you know they don't want to be like a mark like disney wants to be more like oh for the children you know you gotta we can't be like too crazy because we don't want to set a bad example to the kids um but like in dc it's just like they just throw on the wall and it works like and they're like as long as disney doesn't buy warner bros

3403
04:13:56,480 --> 04:14:10,100
we're okay but i'm scared i'm that it is still a possibility because like disney is slowly buying every fucking property in existence so i'm a little scared because like warner bros um is apparently gonna be sold again

3404
04:14:18,000 --> 04:15:15,380
yeah i know the ceo for like warren boas is not the best because you know they did they canceled like you know the wildy coyote shit and everything but at least it's not owned by disney at least it's not owned by disney that's like the little things uh captain eight ball they give a super chat thank you thank you uh i don't even remember but i said i was gonna send you some comments i hadn't had time i was wondering why you're what you were interested in i'm gonna add some random stuff like no not the harley quinn fart comic oh i remember someone i remember seeing that on twitter oh my it was because it was written by some fetish artist too like from fetish art third i was super into farts as well god that's so bad thank you this super chat captain april thank you thank you i'm what is it called deceased i really enjoy i haven't finished reading the sequels to deceased i finished reading the first the first um um arc for deceased but i didn't read the sequels yet i stopped when like

3405
04:15:15,380 --> 04:15:32,580
they start they like left earth that's where i stopped uh oh you guys didn't know that yeah they had um dc did like a rage bait comment where they made entire comic series based off of harley quinn fighting it's i there's nothing else i can say like

3406
04:15:35,980 --> 04:15:55,580
I could explain more but there's no thing else to explain that's the context like and it was released on crew it was it's like this is not a joke by the way this is yeah

3407
04:15:58,840 --> 04:16:36,760
yeah so yeah it's called Harley Quinn for fartacular it's silent but deadly oh my god how many comics was there for this like how many did they yeah it's not it's i wish it was rage bait it's it's not it was literally the artist's quick uh kink too like it was his fetish or her fetish i think it was her fetish i'm pretty sure i think it was written by a woman um which is very surprising you know because you know she was she was suppressing a lot All right,

3408
04:16:36,940 --> 04:16:38,160
let's see, I'll read a review.

3409
04:16:38,520 --> 04:16:38,840
All right.

3410
04:16:41,680 --> 04:16:43,740
It's sort of, okay, wait, what?

3411
04:16:44,960 --> 04:16:47,920
Maybe this is sort of body positivity comedy.

3412
04:16:48,840 --> 04:16:51,020
So let's try to justify it.

3413
04:16:51,180 --> 04:16:53,940
You're like, maybe it's body positivity.

3414
04:16:54,400 --> 04:16:55,080
I don't know.

3415
04:16:55,440 --> 04:17:02,580
Oh, like, recommend it if you're a fan of any sort of Harley Quinn slapstick comedy, no matter what, you're into farts.

3416
04:17:02,860 --> 04:17:05,320
You're like, really into farts.

3417
04:17:10,060 --> 04:17:23,960
Okay, Harley Quinn Partacular Silent But Deadly is an unsettling mixture of childish humor and fetishist sexual innuendo, seemingly only meant to appeal to those who truly love every experience related to farting.

3418
04:17:24,380 --> 04:17:30,100
For the small subset of fans out there who fall under that category, I assume they'll be very happy.

3419
04:17:30,460 --> 04:17:34,380
For everyone else, it's a deeply uncomfortable experience.

3420
04:17:34,380 --> 04:17:41,900
one out of ten it's like yeah one out of ten

3421
04:17:45,600 --> 04:18:00,300
okay but it is yeah that score no I think like if he could he would give a lower score if this person could

3422
04:18:03,400 --> 04:18:11,400
that's crazy things are killing it's Not even my fight was Captain.

3423
04:18:12,540 --> 04:18:13,880
Golden, thank you for the super chat.

Thank you, thank you.

04:18:14,840 --> 04:18:15,260
It was me.

3426
04:18:15,340 --> 04:18:18,820
I thought the final fight was in the docs, everything.

3427
04:18:19,000 --> 04:18:20,600
After that fight was white from my brain.

3428
04:18:20,720 --> 04:18:22,520
I just remember being stuck in that fight.

3429
04:18:22,940 --> 04:18:23,540

Some, even Lois Lane, not in front of, not in front of Clark, Bruce.

3454
04:24:09,220 --> 04:24:11,600
Bruce Wayne is a Bruce Wayne.

I gotta see if this is official artwork from Mr. Bruce.

3463
04:24:34,460 --> 04:24:35,400
There's no way.

04:24:36,380 --> 04:24:37,620
Oh my god.

3465
04:24:38,000 --> 04:24:38,700
There's no way.

3466
04:24:38,760 --> 04:24:46,760
I found a... I found an artwork from a foreign, but I'm... I'm concerned.

3467
04:24:46,780 --> 04:24:51,740
I cannot show it on stream because it is very...

3481
04:26:26,350 --> 04:26:26,750

3484
04:26:30,930 --> 04:26:31,870
For those who wanna...

3485
04:26:31,870 --> 04:26:33,530
I would say it is not safe for work.

3486
04:26:33,650 --> 04:26:34,550
It is very not safe for work.

3487
04:26:34,850 --> 04:26:35,170
If you guys...

3488
04:26:35,170 --> 04:26:38,890
Anyone who's curious, I did not realize this, but wow.

3489
04:26:39,070 --> 04:26:39,730
Now I understand.

3490
04:26:39,890 --> 04:26:41,630
He is definitely the horniest DC writer.

3491
04:26:41,850 --> 04:26:42,930
He is, oh my God.

3492
04:26:43,310 --> 04:26:45,090
He is the, oh my God.

3493
04:26:45,230 --> 04:26:46,730
I can't believe he's created all these shows.

3494
04:26:47,290 --> 04:26:52,930
I, I can't believe, no wonder they made her leave, Joker.

3495
04:26:53,630 --> 04:26:55,970
Oh, oh my God.

3496
04:26:56,150 --> 04:26:57,990
No, how did he, oh my God.

3497
04:26:58,050 --> 04:27:00,630
I'm so sad that he created all my childhood shows.

3498
04:27:01,170 --> 04:27:02,390
Oh my God.

3499
04:27:02,530 --> 04:27:03,790
I'm, I'm so sad.

3500
04:27:03,790 --> 04:27:05,490
He created Batman Beyond.

3501
04:27:05,610 --> 04:27:06,530
I'm so sad.

3502
04:27:07,590 --> 04:27:08,310
No!

3503
04:27:15,050 --> 04:27:16,570
He's looking me through the window.

3504
04:27:17,650 --> 04:27:19,730
Never beat your ears.

3505
04:27:20,530 --> 04:27:20,890
Never.

3506
04:27:21,150 --> 04:27:22,010
I didn't realize.

3507
04:27:22,390 --> 04:27:24,450
I didn't realize his dark side.

3508
04:27:26,870 --> 04:27:28,930
His inner beast.

3509
04:27:29,290 --> 04:27:32,330
He kept his inner beast locked down.

3510
04:27:36,810 --> 04:27:38,250
He did.

3511
04:27:38,690 --> 04:27:40,130
He had so much respect.

3512
04:27:40,150 --> 04:28:25,070
